[0.00 → 6.30] What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show there is a ton of news to talk about this week
[6.30 → 12.66] So if you hate it when we get distracted from shilling for LTTstore.com and randomly bantering
[12.66 → 19.56] Then you are not going to have a lot of fun today. Let's get right into it. No delay. New York lawmakers are debating
[19.56 → 24.52] Background checks for 3d printers. Oh, and our headline topic
[24.52 → 33.22] Nvidia is no longer allowed to export RTX 4090s to China. How will they game without 4090s?
[33.24 → 39.96] It's actually impossible. I mean they're going to look back on their lives and think how much of my life did I spend without ray tracing?
[40.16 → 43.62] That's an older reference, but come on. It still checks out. It still checks out, right?
[43.62 → 50.82] What else we got today? Apple to potentially update phones while they're in their boxes. No, that is actually cool
[50.82 → 54.32] No, that's why I actually really like it because that means they can turn them on
[55.54 → 59.74] Remotely well, we'll talk about that later. That's nuts. We'll talk about that. I don't know what's going on later
[59.74 → 65.52] Uh and Twitter's going to charge users. I don't know. Furthermore, I was told not to read the doc
[65.52 → 71.42] I don't know what other topics are in here. I've been I've been told there's like a lot of them. Yeah. Yeah, they're good
[71.42 → 75.70] I believe wow this Donkey Kong game. We'll talk about that later
[80.82 → 84.82] Okay, stop reading
[95.94 → 99.32] The show is brought to you today by Thrum AG one and
[100.24 → 104.24] Sea sonic at least I think that was seen sonic the screen went away, and I was looking at something else
[104.80 → 107.40] All right, why don't we jump right into our first topic?
[107.40 → 110.20] We're going to get through it pretty quick because it's not actually a big discussion one
[110.20 → 120.24] It just kind of worked as a title the US has banned the export of RTX 4090s to China as part of their attempts to keep China behind in terms of
[121.00 → 126.68] technological savvy it doesn't seem to be going that well based on that new Huawei phone that just came out
[126.68 → 133.64] Have you been paying attention to that? No, so it's supposedly their first completely homegrown fabled processor
[133.64 → 141.48] that's reasonably modern and yeah, it's a little on the slower side compared to what you can get from the likes of Qualcomm or Apple right now, but it's
[142.60 → 144.76] not that bad
[145.76 → 151.40] Like it's you know if you think about that they could clearly build guided missiles 10 years ago
[151.40 → 157.84] And you look at this processor on this phone and go well, it's a lot faster than phones from 10 years ago
[157.84 → 165.92] Yeah, it's like if the US's goal is that they're not going to be able to build weaponry or whatever then I think that that's
[166.40 → 170.34] Going great. The US is increasing its AI research, but yeah
[170.34 → 176.78] Well AI is a big part of it right now, but in general they're trying to put pressure on China and keep them
[177.28 → 180.58] Keep them behind the US in terms of technological advancement
[180.58 → 185.70] Which I think is I think that horse is kind of out of the paddock is it horses that come out of the paddock?
[185.70 → 191.58] It's something horses bolted something like that the barn door is open sure the point is
[191.58 → 195.16] Cats out of the bag the US is increasing. Why did you put a cat in a bag?
[196.06 → 203.20] Not, not like what is wrong with you? It's like it's like a messenger bag at least just one cat and it's open
[203.20 → 207.80] How many cats did you have in there? It's just an easier way to carry. Oh, there's like there's like six
[207.80 → 210.36] Only one of them got out of the bag
[210.36 → 215.80] The US is increasing export restrictions on advanced AI chips to China
[215.80 → 222.34] Which will also limit exports to countries like Saudi Arabia the UAE and Vietnam though China is the primary target of the policy
[222.34 → 227.04] Companies will now require a special export license to ship Nvidia
[227.04 → 233.16] A800 and H800 GPUs to China. There are variants of the a100 and H100
[233.16 → 235.72] I think there are some typos in here that Nvidia modified
[235.72 → 243.16] Oh, these are the variants of the a100 and H100 that Nvidia modified to comply with export restrictions put in place last year
[243.16 → 247.72] So those were intended to keep China from having access to the most advanced AI chips
[247.72 → 250.28] Now they're basically going yeah
[250.28 → 254.74] No, the old rules left consumer graphics cards untouched
[254.74 → 259.64] But the new rules also restrict sales of Nvidia's RTX 4090
[259.64 → 263.64] Vendors can apply for a special license to sell these GPUs
[263.64 → 267.02] But it's not clear how likely the government is to grant them
[267.02 → 272.72] Companies will also be required to inform the US government before selling chips below the restriction threshold
[272.72 → 279.12] In August 2022, this is a big hit for Nvidia disclosed that it anticipated
[279.12 → 282.16] 400 million dollars in quarterly sales
[282.80 → 284.80] Not annual sales
[284.80 → 287.20] Quarterly sales from China
[288.32 → 292.64] So there's a couple main discussion points here, you know, one of them is
[294.40 → 300.96] Is this going to do anything and I think I've made my feelings on it pretty clear in the very very very short term?
[300.96 → 304.64] It might slow down some of China's AI progress
[304.64 → 306.64] I have a potential counterargument to that
[306.64 → 308.16] But really?
[308.16 → 308.64] Yeah
[308.64 → 310.24] You know what? I would love to hear it
[310.24 → 316.56] So maybe in regard to raw compute power it will
[316.56 → 323.04] But I think the policy wrestling that the American companies have to deal with will slow them down just as much or more
[323.04 → 325.76] Yeah, that's that's probably fair
[325.76 → 334.72] Also, I am not convinced that we necessarily need a ton more hardware out there in the field
[334.72 → 335.04] to
[335.04 → 339.04] Continue to develop AI in a meaningful way
[339.04 → 339.28] Yeah
[339.28 → 340.40] If that makes sense to you
[340.40 → 347.44] Like yes, if you want to build a service that real customers are really using and refine things for sure
[347.44 → 349.04] But at the research level
[349.04 → 353.36] I'm willing to bet that there are enough RTX whatever the craps in China right now
[353.36 → 359.36] And I guarantee you they could poke through that firewall to access remote power if they needed to
[359.92 → 361.92] remote resources I should say if they needed to
[361.92 → 362.56] Yep
[362.56 → 363.12] Yep
[363.12 → 364.56] Also
[364.56 → 369.20] A lot of the models like what is llama and all these other ones are all open anyway
[369.76 → 372.64] Like and no, maybe it's not the
[373.36 → 377.04] Point of the sword, but they're they're they're pretty ridiculously good. I don't know
[377.52 → 380.64] I don't think there's really any holding them back very much. I mean
[381.36 → 383.36] personally Elijah from our
[383.68 → 388.56] Who's our junior writer in the writing department and clearly has some research to do asks
[388.96 → 392.40] Wouldn't NVIDIA just make a factory over there or am I ignorant so
[393.28 → 399.52] The restrictions are from the U.S. Government on NVIDIA an u.s. Company headquartered in the U.S.
[400.08 → 403.28] That prevent NVIDIA from shipping advanced
[403.84 → 409.92] Processors to China those processors are actually manufactured in Taiwan which depending on who you ask is or isn't
[410.48 → 416.48] Part of china, but for the purposes of these regulations Taiwan it would not be part of china
[416.48 → 418.56] Which is a really kind of funny thing?
[418.56 → 420.40] It's very interesting because the U.S. Is
[420.96 → 427.20] Stance is sort of like we don't take a position on this by the way except NVIDIA you may not export chips to China
[428.40 → 432.24] That are manufactured in you know what we're not going to take a position on this
[434.32 → 436.56] So so so the U.S. Government is
[437.28 → 440.88] Sort of within their rights to restrict these exports
[440.88 → 450.64] But also, I think this raises some fascinating questions about in general the barriers that are being put up between international cooperation
[451.76 → 456.16] Where governments are stepping in and especially the U.S. Government?
[456.80 → 460.88] Governments are stepping in and restricting companies abilities to operate over
[461.60 → 463.60] borders internationally
[463.60 → 466.96] I'm honestly not the right person to talk about that. There's a lot of yeah
[466.96 → 472.00] There are a lot of geopolitical debates there. It's complicated. There 's's one people have been talking about for a long time
[472.64 → 474.32] That neither of us are you know
[475.12 → 480.56] In the right position to debate too much, but there 's's been this kind of assumption for a long time that there can be no
[481.44 → 489.44] Real like war because all the countries are too interconnected and rely on each other too much and by closing that
[490.32 → 492.40] Door there are some concerns
[493.04 → 496.64] That are far above my understanding, but yeah in other news
[497.04 → 503.36] Jon Stewart's Apple TV plus show the problem has reportedly been cancelled prior to its third season following
[503.92 → 510.96] Creative differences between Stewart and leadership at apple over how Stewart wanted to cover artificial intelligence and china
[512.16 → 514.16] Things are getting complicated
[515.28 → 521.76] Hey, Jon Stewart if you want a home on float plane, we're yeah, we're we're ready. We're ready for you. I love Jon Stewart
[521.76 → 529.60] Guy guys are real the guys real what he did for the firefighters was super cool. Yeah, guy the guys real all right
[529.76 → 535.68] Why don't we do another big topic man should we court controversy, or should we go with something safe?
[535.68 → 540.48] Controversy first let's do it heat up and then cool down all right
[540.48 → 545.44] You already saw the headline for this New York lawmakers could be background checks for 3d printers
[545.44 → 549.04] I'm going to let you read the topic, and I'm just gonna look at your face
[549.76 → 554.72] He doesn't know about this yet. He's been completely disconnected this week. Just like busy doing other things while the week
[554.72 → 560.24] Yeah, I am so excited. Lets all watch Luke. Oh boy. This isn't weird at all. Wow
[563.04 → 564.48] Paint me
[564.80 → 573.44] New York legislators have proposed a bill that would require a criminal background check to buy 3d printers that could be used to print any part of a firearm
[574.00 → 575.92] This would likely
[575.92 → 579.76] This would likely include a vast majority of 3d printers commercially available
[579.76 → 583.92] Yeah, like pretty much all of them including relatively cheap FDM printers
[584.40 → 588.72] According to the bill as written background checks could take up to 15 business days
[589.52 → 593.76] sale of these 3d printers would be prohibited to any user who has a
[594.72 → 600.96] Conviction or outstanding warrant for a felony or other serious crime while many 3d printed guns require at least a few
[601.04 → 607.44] Yeah, at least a few metal parts. Yeah, at least a couple like a barrel. Uh, but anyway
[607.44 → 612.32] At least a few metal parts for reliability and accuracy
[612.48 → 618.00] There are some relatively weak printed guns that can be made entirely of plastic or wood
[618.40 → 624.80] Um, but anyway, let's skip past that. Uh, except the firing pin. However, I mean there are ways around that too
[625.04 → 628.72] Uh, however, these guns typically fall apart after only a few uses. Yeah
[629.92 → 631.04] Okay, um
[631.52 → 633.52] Hmm
[637.44 → 645.92] Now to be clear, okay, look Luke's not some kind of like 2FA die hard like nothing else matters
[646.48 → 648.48] But also I think has a pretty
[649.84 → 651.84] realistic view of
[652.80 → 653.36] There's
[653.36 → 660.16] of of of of what kind of legislation could meaningfully impact yeah firearm safety
[660.16 → 664.64] And it's honestly it's not the kind of thing that we're going to get into in great detail on the show
[664.64 → 666.80] Even though it's something that we both have thoughts on and yeah
[667.20 → 669.04] We have talked to each other about privately
[669.04 → 675.44] But what I knew for sure is that you were going to get a huge kick out of this because this will do absolutely
[676.08 → 677.04] f***ING
[677.04 → 679.04] Nothing that is why it will serve
[680.08 → 686.00] Absolutely no purpose other than to make it inconvenient to get a 3d printer and probably only
[686.00 → 688.00] marginally so
[688.32 → 691.68] Luke myth busters wood cannon look up the
[692.56 → 700.32] recent assassination of the Japanese look a hand a handheld flipping crossbow is in a lot of ways more
[700.40 → 707.12] Dangerous than a firearm because of how stealthily it can be used those are super illegal here, but you can
[707.12 → 715.92] Totally make one without a 3d printer like it's its it's its bizarre to me that they are basically
[716.40 → 718.40] It's its like banning scissors and tape
[718.96 → 723.52] Like I'm sorry you can't have tape because you might use it to bind somebody
[724.40 → 728.72] Sure you could and no this is not this is not one of those
[729.68 → 731.68] What's it called a straw man argument or whatever?
[731.68 → 731.92] I
[731.92 → 733.12] I
[733.12 → 737.60] Or single shot shotguns with metal pipes yeah, this is my point like
[738.16 → 743.84] I'm not taking this to an absurd level just to demonstrate that this is a slippery slope or anything. This is
[744.32 → 750.96] Actually ridiculous. If you want to make stuff you can make stuff you don't need a 3d printer. You could fire a bullet without a gun
[751.12 → 755.60] Yeah, you literally don't even need one. I know this from experience
[757.12 → 759.12] Don't worry about
[759.12 → 761.12] I
[761.68 → 763.68] Not accurately mind you
[764.56 → 765.76] Yeah, okay
[766.96 → 767.68] Yeah, so
[768.48 → 769.60] Hmm
[769.60 → 771.60] I'm going to chat CNC machines um
[771.92 → 779.84] Yeah, like what wait this is my then bleach and ammonia because they can be used to make mustard gas styrofoam gasoline and styrofoam yeah
[780.00 → 782.00] like I'm sorry
[782.00 → 784.00] I
[784.00 → 786.00] I
[786.00 → 789.12] Just fell out of the exact same one at the same time nice
[789.36 → 789.84] um
[790.40 → 793.84] Yeah, like I don't know you can't, you can't, it's just it's not it
[794.00 → 798.40] It's literally just going to be annoying to people that want 3d printers and realistically okay
[798.96 → 802.32] Actually, I'm I'm glad that you brought up the anarchist cookbook because
[804.16 → 806.16] I
[806.16 → 808.16] I
[808.16 → 810.16] Just literally not what happened
[811.36 → 816.80] Yeah, well, you know it's got all kinds of instructions for how to do things with fuel. I used gas lighting
[819.04 → 821.04] um
[821.04 → 823.04] I'm glad you'm glad you
[824.72 → 826.72] I thought it was pretty good
[828.56 → 833.92] I'm glad you brought up the anarchist cookbook because yeah sure the only reason that I ever downloaded it
[834.56 → 840.32] The only reason I even became aware of it was because someone tried to ban it at some point when I was in high school
[840.32 → 841.04] Me too
[841.04 → 845.76] I bet you we did I probably downloaded the same file and very likely same day
[845.76 → 850.80] So it's its it's pretty much just your classic Streisand effect, right?
[851.04 → 854.48] Yeah, all this talk about 3d printing guns
[855.12 → 857.68] I'm not saying that it's going to change anything
[858.24 → 859.76] Eventually 3d printed guns
[860.40 → 864.40] Will proliferate they will be absolutely everywhere you will be able to 3d print a
[865.04 → 872.24] Sophisticated weapon with commodity hardware. I have no doubt whatsoever of that always going to have problems with
[872.96 → 879.60] But certain things trying to slow it down in this way is doing absolutely nothing
[880.16 → 883.52] Other than sparking a conversation. I wouldn't be talking about this right now
[884.48 → 888.08] If New York wasn't deciding to do background checks
[889.20 → 890.32] for three I mean
[892.56 → 895.44] It's not like there's some kind of biometric authentication
[895.44 → 898.88] All you would have to do is recruit some low-level crony
[898.88 → 904.48] You know like organized criminals do who doesn't have a record yet get them to do the dirty work
[904.48 → 909.84] Which is apparently going to the store and buying a fucking 3d printer now
[910.88 → 913.28] And then you can print as many guns as you want
[913.76 → 919.44] Because it's not like they're even going to limit how many 3d printers you can buy so you just roll up to
[920.00 → 922.48] Freaking I don't know whatever stores they have in New York
[922.48 → 926.88] That sell 3d printers walk out with an arm load of 3d printers
[926.88 → 930.32] What are you going to do with these? I don't know sell stuff on Etsy. Yeah, exactly
[930.96 → 933.44] Prove I'm not. Yeah, so what's next?
[933.44 → 937.12] We're going to have chips and 3d printers that prevent them from printing, you know
[937.36 → 940.64] Firearms pieces like you have in printers that keep you from printing currency
[942.32 → 946.72] There's no way it's not realistic. There are so many different ways so many different forms. I mean they could yeah
[946.72 → 951.60] I mean could it kind of AI it. I mean anything with a tube. No, yeah, really
[951.84 → 955.28] I mean, that's what it kind of well the tube is not it's plastic is being terrible
[956.40 → 960.56] Yeah, but it's technically possible for one. Maybe uh, there's a lot of pressure. I
[961.76 → 965.68] Think you don't know enough about this. I think it's being like this big
[965.68 → 974.00] I don't know um, yeah, ban stepper motors exactly. Thanks, Dan
[974.64 → 975.60] like just
[976.40 → 978.40] There's so many other
[978.56 → 982.16] It's this is clear and this is one of the problems with a lot of gun laws
[982.80 → 984.00] um
[984.00 → 987.52] Is this is clearly made by someone who has no idea what they're talking about?
[987.76 → 993.04] Yep. I mean like look it's one of those things where again, we're not going to get just going to do nothing and just be annoying
[993.04 → 997.04] We are realistically not going to get into the exact details of our stances
[997.12 → 1001.76] But one thing that Luke and I did talk about in a fair bit of detail is in Canada
[1002.16 → 1010.16] They released a list of weapons that moved from not banned to ban. This is what a year ago two years ago. I don't remember the exact timeline
[1010.16 → 1012.16] I can't remember when it happened, but
[1012.48 → 1018.64] Basically as far as either of us could tell and Luke is far more knowledgeable about it than me
[1018.64 → 1025.44] So take whatever I'm saying as just the vague recollections of something someone who actually knows anything told them a long time ago
[1025.84 → 1026.56] um
[1026.56 → 1028.56] But as far as either of us could tell
[1029.68 → 1034.16] Most of the rationale appeared to be around the aesthetics. Yeah
[1035.84 → 1042.24] So I went through an exercise of showing Linus all the things that were still on the market which were significantly scarier like
[1042.88 → 1044.88] Terrifying. Yeah
[1045.12 → 1047.60] Um, do you have man do you have any examples?
[1047.60 → 1049.44] I'm not going to be able to bring it up right now
[1049.44 → 1052.16] But there's one where it's a folding shotgun
[1052.64 → 1056.08] That is going to be shorter than the length of your femur when folded
[1056.48 → 1060.40] And comes with a strapped on femur mount
[1060.96 → 1063.84] Yeah, so it just like shotguns
[1064.40 → 1070.16] Are scary and a lot of the policymakers seem to not think so because they play like
[1070.16 → 1072.80] Yeah, like what I mean they're for ducks, right?
[1072.80 → 1074.40] Yeah, it's like
[1074.40 → 1077.84] No, they're for turning objects into ground meat
[1082.40 → 1084.56] Against an unarmoured target
[1085.60 → 1089.92] Holy crap the fact that we're oh man. Yeah, anyway
[1089.92 → 1094.80] So it's its mostly the
[1095.84 → 1097.84] Otter illogicality
[1097.84 → 1098.16] Is that a word?
[1098.16 → 1102.64] Yeah, it's just constantly policymakers that have no idea what they're talking about putting policy in that
[1103.12 → 1108.00] Mostly just annoys people um and doesn't really actually accomplish anything
[1109.36 → 1113.28] I think this is super common with firearms. I'm not surprised that
[1114.08 → 1117.28] um this one is similarly like what?
[1117.28 → 1119.28] Um
[1119.36 → 1123.84] So much out. I want to strap on femur mount. Yeah, I I'm not even saying anything about
[1125.12 → 1128.72] The stuff I was just pointing out that like the way that certain laws are written
[1129.36 → 1138.00] Like that one shotgun in particular is able to skirt around certain Canadian laws because it it meets certain very specific requirements
[1138.64 → 1139.04] um
[1139.92 → 1140.96] but like if you
[1140.96 → 1145.84] If you went into the nature of what the law is trying to accomplish
[1147.04 → 1149.68] You would think that that thing should definitely not be allowed
[1149.68 → 1154.16] But if you go into the technical specifics of how the law works, it is totally allowed
[1154.80 → 1155.44] So it's like
[1156.24 → 1160.64] Huh, this is weird and there's a lot of a lot of firearms laws end up being that way
[1160.96 → 1161.92] um
[1161.92 → 1163.92] where you end up with like
[1163.92 → 1165.92] weird things going on
[1165.92 → 1167.92] and oftentimes
[1167.92 → 1173.04] situations that are actually significantly more dangerous for the people that are trying to follow the laws properly
[1173.44 → 1174.96] Because it now puts them
[1175.68 → 1179.20] The things that they were using to be more safe are now illegal
[1179.92 → 1180.32] um
[1181.20 → 1187.20] Because again people not knowing what they're talking about like it's if it's a firearms law is a very weird realm
[1187.44 → 1187.76] um
[1187.76 → 1192.08] And this one's also weird because again you can just have like a pipe
[1192.08 → 1194.08] Yeah, Shinzō Abe
[1195.28 → 1198.32] This is posted in float plane shot was killed by what a piece of PVC
[1198.32 → 1199.04] No, this is what I mentioned
[1199.04 → 1202.56] A two by four and a nail or something like that like it's yeah
[1202.56 → 1207.76] Like that gun was very not a gun the article said one shot with except yeah
[1207.76 → 1212.24] It can be made entirely plastic with the exception of the firing pin, and it's like yeah except you can use
[1212.80 → 1215.20] I don't know piece of metal a nail yeah, like
[1216.48 → 1218.48] Yeah
[1218.48 → 1225.28] Someone most of the 3d printing stuff when it comes to firearms as far as I've been able to observe is to like to make it so they look cooler
[1225.76 → 1229.84] Because having a pipe and a plank of wood doesn't necessarily look that cool
[1230.48 → 1236.32] Like it's its not I don't know and let's not forget like if refire rates not a concern people literally
[1236.64 → 1242.56] fabricated their own firearms, and you know like the 1800s or whatever like if all you need to do is propel
[1243.52 → 1247.84] a ball bearing at high enough speed to penetrate a human body that is
[1248.64 → 1254.56] Not difficult to make on your own stuff has been without 3d printers very very very long time
[1256.80 → 1257.36] So like
[1258.72 → 1265.36] I don't know brush there's also you can find videos of them online. There's like 3d printed firearms competitions
[1266.80 → 1273.20] Um, and it's its mostly like can your firearm make it through because they'll all like fall apart
[1273.20 → 1276.56] And this is many years in yeah
[1278.72 → 1282.16] I don't know someone in float plane chat ask would you let your kids 3d print a gun?
[1282.56 → 1283.04] Um, no
[1284.24 → 1285.92] This is not the same
[1285.92 → 1287.92] Oh
[1289.04 → 1290.16] I'm not I'm not saying
[1291.68 → 1294.88] All I'm saying is that this law will not change anything
[1295.92 → 1296.72] That's all I'm saying
[1297.36 → 1302.24] And you can tell by how it's written that the person making the law has no idea that that's true
[1304.72 → 1309.04] It's almost like when we're looking at your know laws around right to repair
[1309.60 → 1311.60] Or net neutrality, or I mean
[1311.60 → 1313.52] It's all the same situation
[1313.52 → 1318.40] It's lawmakers making laws about things that they have no idea what they're talking about and lobbyists and lobbyists
[1319.04 → 1321.28] Informing them about the things that they want them to know
[1321.28 → 1324.56] I'm trying to figure out who's lobbying for this. Is this just kind of
[1325.60 → 1328.56] Like a special interest group maybe or something like who's
[1329.20 → 1333.60] I'm assuming it's just anti-firearm stuff in general, but I just I think that even from
[1334.80 → 1340.32] That standpoint like this again, it's it doesn't change anything. It just annoys 3d printer people and honestly
[1340.32 → 1346.08] I bet you because I haven't probably doesn't even annoy 3d printer people who already have 3d printers
[1346.08 → 1352.16] Yeah, that too like what are they going to make you like hand them in that and can I just bring up for a moment that New York is a tiny state
[1353.52 → 1361.36] Yeah, which is very relevant here because nothing prevents you from crossing state lines into New York with a 3d printer
[1363.04 → 1367.68] Like it's one of those wimpy eastern states back when everybody walked everywhere like
[1367.68 → 1369.92] I
[1369.92 → 1377.12] Just I'm imagining in my head someone with like a tarp in the back of their car covering up their like 3d printers as they drive into
[1379.28 → 1383.76] I'm smuggling in 3d printers New York gangsters going from like bootlegging
[1384.72 → 1391.28] GTO fan and twitch chat being like not really New York city is small, but the state isn't brother
[1391.28 → 1393.28] Yeah, we're from Canada
[1396.08 → 1400.40] Anything I can drive across in like a few hours is small. Yeah
[1401.44 → 1403.44] Yeah, oh man. Oh
[1404.80 → 1406.80] So yeah, I don't know. Um
[1407.76 → 1411.20] I think if anything this is going to amplify
[1411.68 → 1415.68] uh 3d printed firearms because now people are if they're gonna
[1415.68 → 1419.68] Attempt to ban it in any way you're effectively
[1420.40 → 1427.04] Communicating to people whether this is true. You're communicating to people that this thing is effective and dangerous. Yeah
[1427.20 → 1428.40] Um
[1428.40 → 1431.68] So now more bad actors will be interested in it
[1431.92 → 1436.24] Um, so here I'm gonna I'm just going to help people out here a little bit
[1436.88 → 1438.08] um
[1438.08 → 1440.08] Okay
[1440.08 → 1445.36] See someone if open chat you can 3d print firearms neat it's like oh this is New York state
[1448.16 → 1450.96] There we go so from the centre it is
[1452.64 → 1454.64] Five hours out
[1454.64 → 1457.68] Basically, okay, this is bc where we live
[1461.04 → 1462.88] From here to here
[1463.76 → 1469.04] To here he didn't even just include Vancouver Island. Oh, yeah, yeah this island and this island is also part of it. Yeah
[1469.84 → 1473.68] So just to give you some context I'm not look look look look look look okay
[1473.68 → 1476.16] It's this is not a measuring contest
[1477.28 → 1479.28] But ours is what ours is bigger
[1480.32 → 1482.72] Which is why you don't want it to be a measuring contest
[1486.56 → 1489.76] Look there was bound to be a measuring contest I was going to win at some point
[1490.48 → 1492.48] Just let me have this one
[1492.48 → 1502.08] It ends up being the size of a state versus the size of a province
[1503.20 → 1503.60] uh
[1504.40 → 1505.28] A lot
[1505.28 → 1508.88] I think a lot of Americans are actually mad because yes
[1509.36 → 1511.36] yes the distortion of
[1511.36 → 1516.08] Looking at a globe on a flat whatever does make bc look bigger than it is
[1516.72 → 1519.68] Also, yes, it's mostly mountainous garbage
[1520.24 → 1521.28] Not inhabitable
[1522.40 → 1525.84] Covered in snow or rock that is covered in snow
[1526.32 → 1527.04] Uh, yes
[1527.68 → 1533.04] We get it, but it's huge bc is bigger than Texas America has the America has the best land
[1533.76 → 1534.72] The greatest land
[1535.12 → 1539.92] Yeah, okay, so if you want to win one uh if you want to look at how uninhabitable
[1539.92 → 1547.92] Yeah, Canada is if you look at the population distribution of Canada we're all snuggling up against that us border
[1548.24 → 1554.24] Everybody no, no one lives in like most of Canada or I shouldn't say no one because now I'm going to
[1554.24 → 1560.64] Piss off a very, very small population of people um, but there's there's a there's a little sprinkling through the rest of it
[1560.64 → 1568.88] 90 percent uh and somewhere between depending on whether you take your source uh depending on whether you source from Quora or interesting facts.com
[1569.28 → 1575.68] Somewhere between 85 and 90 percent of Canadians apparently live within 100 miles of the US border
[1576.08 → 1578.48] So could literally get there within an hour or two
[1579.28 → 1579.60] Yeah
[1580.48 → 1584.96] And yet we don't go there I'm kidding we do we go there for shopping it's so much cheaper
[1586.56 → 1589.84] Yeah, we love our neighbour we love our neighbours to the south we really do
[1590.80 → 1591.84] But our country is bigger
[1591.84 → 1601.52] Look we got nothing else okay, it's the only thing we can, we got rocks it's right and trees and ice
[1602.72 → 1604.72] Lots of ice and water
[1605.12 → 1607.12] Oh no forget that part soon
[1607.12 → 1609.12] um
[1609.28 → 1611.28] Yeah
[1611.28 → 1615.76] This is great this Vox headline
[1616.48 → 1620.16] Canada is a huge country most of it is unfit for human
[1620.96 → 1622.40] I love where it gets cut off
[1622.96 → 1624.80] Yeah, it's kind of true though unfit for human
[1625.20 → 1626.16] Yeah, human what?
[1626.80 → 1629.12] Just human you just got to live at the bottom unfit
[1629.52 → 1629.76] Yeah
[1630.96 → 1632.24] All right um
[1632.24 → 1636.08] Okay, okay, but this one's cool though
[1636.72 → 1639.76] Brand new and updated inbox
[1639.76 → 1642.32] According to reliable leaker mark German
[1642.88 → 1644.56] Apple is planning a system
[1644.56 → 1652.40] To update sealed iPhones inside their retail stores without ever taking them out of the box
[1653.04 → 1660.24] Allegedly these sealed boxes this is so cool will be placed on a proprietary pad like device
[1660.24 → 1662.24] That will turn on the iPhone
[1662.24 → 1665.60] Install the latest updates and turn it back off
[1665.60 → 1669.28] People are pointing out that New York has like four times the population of bc
[1670.08 → 1672.32] California has the population of Canada
[1672.32 → 1677.12] Yeah, we have slightly more than them now only because we just cranked on immigration
[1677.12 → 1677.92] Oh, that's true
[1677.92 → 1678.40] For like years
[1678.40 → 1680.88] Yeah, we were lower than California for a long time
[1680.88 → 1683.20] We have no idea how many people actually live in California though
[1685.12 → 1685.76] That's true
[1686.48 → 1687.60] That's that is true
[1688.80 → 1695.28] These devices will apparently roll out to Apple stores before the end of the year can I, for one, say
[1696.24 → 1701.44] That this is awesome. It sounds cool. I love it and look I'm sure there's
[1702.08 → 1708.00] Bound to be some creepy things about the mechanism. I'm a little bit worried about what someone might be able to use something like this for
[1708.56 → 1712.96] I just I don't know how you could use it improperly. I've been trying to rack my brain on that the whole time
[1712.96 → 1716.72] I mean there could be an attack vector where if you get one of these devices
[1717.28 → 1723.28] You can force someone's phone to update to a particular version of iOS that maybe has some exploit that you can
[1723.76 → 1726.16] Take advantage of and because you can turn it on
[1726.96 → 1731.12] Uh, even someone who thinks their phone is like off and safe you could still do
[1731.12 → 1735.12] I don't know or something but based on that you have to have physical access to the phone
[1735.68 → 1739.12] By which time do you pretty much? Yeah, it seems like it. Yes
[1739.44 → 1740.80] It's a pad that you put it on
[1741.36 → 1744.80] So presumably it's also transmitting wireless power
[1744.88 → 1746.88] So I would guess that their packaging
[1747.44 → 1751.92] Will maybe have the phone close enough to the bottom that it could get back because you don't want to run a bunch of
[1751.92 → 1757.60] You don't want to run an update on a phone sight unseen having no idea how much battery power it has
[1758.08 → 1760.08] So unless you had like a NFC
[1762.56 → 1766.56] Because I feel like if you have it that close you have you're just asking for damage
[1767.20 → 1769.20] oh, it shouldn't be
[1770.24 → 1773.36] Hard to say. I mean you won't need much power. Yeah, and
[1774.48 → 1778.48] While it's way more effective in very, very proximity
[1779.28 → 1782.40] You can transmit wireless power over a short distance
[1782.40 → 1786.40] I mean, maybe they don't need to maybe they could just have a RFID chip in there that says hey
[1786.40 → 1792.40] I've got x amount of battery or whatever and as long as they can read that then they wouldn't accidentally update something that would then
[1793.28 → 1800.56] Get getting bricked because it loses power mid-update or something like that Danny says there's far too many server handshakes to get an iOS update delivered
[1800.96 → 1803.52] Uh to your phone. It's just not going to be abusable
[1803.52 → 1805.52] I
[1807.44 → 1810.40] My problem with it is the access at all
[1810.40 → 1811.44] um
[1812.40 → 1816.40] Not necessarily the update. I don't know. I'm not sure like
[1817.76 → 1822.08] How this could be used it just it's new um
[1824.16 → 1824.96] And therefore
[1826.16 → 1833.12] Concern I haven't come up with anything in particular yet. Like I said, I'm just like worried. Yeah, and that's not a
[1833.12 → 1838.48] Completely irrational thing and honestly the scenario that I gave is probably not realistic
[1838.80 → 1843.60] I don't even think iOS supports being flashed back to previous versions for example. I don't know
[1844.48 → 1847.84] Um, it sounds sweet though. Like I think it's cool. Um
[1849.36 → 1849.68] I
[1849.68 → 1853.76] I would like to see a lot of devices get this potentially pretty much everything over time
[1853.84 → 1857.44] I mean, it's funny to me not only that this doesn't exist
[1857.44 → 1860.56] Just everywhere but how
[1861.68 → 1862.80] Easily
[1862.80 → 1868.00] Rectified so many cases of devices arriving out of date
[1868.56 → 1871.28] Could be like you buy a computer, right?
[1871.84 → 1876.48] We secret shop companies sometimes we secret shop some pc companies very recently
[1876.80 → 1881.12] We're not going to cover this until part four, so part one is shopping part two is
[1881.68 → 1885.68] Arrival evaluation of the packing materials first impressions part three is
[1886.32 → 1891.76] What is part three ah yes support part three is support and then part four is
[1892.16 → 1896.80] Performance and the actual kind of micro review of every system where we look okay
[1896.80 → 1898.80] How much bloat is on it?
[1898.96 → 1900.72] How out of date are the drivers out of the box?
[1900.72 → 1905.60] We update everything before we run any benchmarks because from our point of view we're evaluating
[1905.60 → 1911.44] The hardware, and we are certainly going to dock points for the bad experience of having to update your own software when it should
[1911.44 → 1915.92] Have just been updated in the first place, but we're not gonna we're not going to intentionally send
[1916.56 → 1918.56] Our like to kneecap up
[1919.36 → 1922.56] An RTX 40 70 with launch drivers
[1923.12 → 1926.48] When a 6800 XT or whatever the equivalent would be
[1927.28 → 1931.52] 6800 or something like that when 6800 gets to run the latest drivers, and we're going to say oh, yeah
[1931.52 → 1935.36] Well, it was a bad computer GeForce experience would have prompted you for an automatic update
[1935.36 → 1938.80] It would have become a better computer. So we're not going to do anything like that. Yeah, but
[1939.60 → 1941.60] We will dock points and
[1941.76 → 1946.48] It is something that we see a lot of devices shipping with completely out of date drivers
[1946.80 → 1950.32] That's not even the most ridiculous one though because that's
[1950.88 → 1956.08] Pretty explainable that pc has been sitting in a box in a best buy for three months or whatever the case may be
[1956.08 → 1964.24] The one that really blows my mind is when I download a piece of software off of the developers' website
[1965.04 → 1970.96] I know where he's going with this. I launch it, and I am immediately prompted to update it drives me. What the f**k
[1971.60 → 1973.60] Was the point of me downloading it?
[1974.16 → 1978.72] That's like when you install a game off the disk, okay? It's 60 gigs you
[1979.44 → 1985.68] Painstakingly wait for those files to copy you go to launch it, and it prompts you for a 60 gig f**king update
[1985.68 → 1989.36] Hey, we're going to update the whole game. What was the point of anything we just did?
[1990.80 → 1992.16] Nothing
[1992.16 → 1993.68] Yeah
[1993.68 → 1995.20] Steam
[1995.20 → 1997.76] Why don't I just download the latest version of steam?
[1999.12 → 2001.12] Okay, hold on
[2001.60 → 2006.28] Trying to think if there's a reason no hold on no there could be a reason no, okay. What if?
[2007.30 → 2009.30] Wrong zip it
[2010.48 → 2012.48] What if fake news
[2012.48 → 2015.20] Somebody
[2015.76 → 2022.72] Managed to replace the steam installer executable on steam powered.com with a piece of malware
[2023.84 → 2033.12] Or with something that is compromised if valve doesn't update it very frequently and just has a thing that basically serves only one purpose and that is to
[2034.16 → 2038.80] Be an application that runs on your computer that downloads the latest version of steam from their servers and handshakes with them
[2038.80 → 2043.76] Then theoretically there could be a security benefit there. I came up with something
[2044.40 → 2046.40] I don't think it's very good. Well, no, I don't
[2048.08 → 2051.76] Obviously I hate this. I think it's a horrible practice, but I'm just I'm trying
[2052.32 → 2054.32] I'm trying to come up with something
[2054.32 → 2057.84] You're from been old and float plane chat says okay
[2058.00 → 2063.36] Okay, the most secure way you download a downloader that downloads the installer that downloads the updates
[2064.00 → 2065.68] And then installs them like I
[2066.24 → 2071.60] Don't know people in chat are saying that the steam downloads only about like two megabytes or something and then it
[2072.32 → 2077.68] Downloads and installs. Yeah, but okay, so bad example, but there are certainly things like this
[2077.68 → 2080.48] Hardware info is one love hardware info. It's a great tool
[2081.36 → 2086.88] You download it from the official mirror and then are immediately prompted to update it every single time
[2088.00 → 2093.20] Why what is what is the point of this? I don't I don't understand. Yeah
[2096.56 → 2099.04] Let's see if anyone yeah, it's a down. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[2100.48 → 2106.48] Either way though, I think this tech is cool. I think it'd be pretty nice to just be able to use things straight out of the box
[2107.68 → 2112.32] Like overall by the way, I'm like super supportive of developers updating their software like yeah, you know
[2112.40 → 2115.44] But issue an update whenever you got you know, new cool stuff to add or whatever
[2115.44 → 2116.48] I'm not complaining about that
[2116.48 → 2122.56] I just thought it'd be really cool if I went directly to your website rather than a third party and I download the latest version of your software
[2122.56 → 2124.56] It was actually the latest version of your software
[2126.48 → 2131.20] I think Avon fox might have nailed the thought process. Yeah, it's risk management
[2131.28 → 2137.44] If you only have a stable download as the main download and your update breaks things then only updated customers are at risk
[2137.68 → 2141.04] Mm-hmm. Yeah, that actually sounds the most likely to me. That's fair
[2142.16 → 2144.48] That's probably it that lines up
[2146.64 → 2147.60] I mean
[2147.60 → 2153.04] I'm just trying to think yeah, you wouldn't have anyone who is authorized to so you're downloading major version
[2153.20 → 2157.60] You wouldn't have anyone who's authorized to push code, but is not authorized to update the website
[2157.84 → 2160.24] Like if there was some kind of disconnect there were the web team
[2160.88 → 2166.80] uh, you know had a single point of had a single bottleneck someone who's allowed to your know, update the files or whatever
[2166.80 → 2167.52] And
[2169.52 → 2170.96] Yeah, I don't know
[2170.96 → 2174.56] No, I yeah, I think that that's probably that's probably the most likely thing
[2176.48 → 2179.92] Yeah, oh man Windows updates. Oh, that makes me so
[2180.88 → 2185.68] frustrated when you check for updates, and it's like here's everything and you
[2186.40 → 2193.44] Install it all, and then it's like you're all up to date, and then you reboot or something or look at it sideways or sneeze or something
[2193.44 → 2197.68] And then you like click it again, and it's like here's 42 more updates what you couldn't have given me
[2198.72 → 2202.40] I don't like when it says you're all up to date, and then you click
[2203.68 → 2208.16] Check now, and then it's like oh, I found stuff. It's like then don't tell me I'm up-to-date in the first place
[2208.16 → 2209.04] Yeah
[2209.04 → 2212.64] Have you noticed steam has gotten less aggressive about heating keeping games up to date?
[2212.96 → 2216.64] Yes, I find half the time I sit down to play something it needs an update look stop
[2216.88 → 2219.04] What is the point of me having auto updates enabled?
[2219.76 → 2221.76] Yeah, but I'm going to download it eventually
[2221.76 → 2223.20] uh
[2223.20 → 2225.04] Eventually accuse it
[2225.04 → 2226.64] Does it yeah?
[2226.64 → 2229.84] It just it'll just it'll just say pending update, and then it'll, it'll update
[2230.48 → 2233.76] It'll be like scheduled for tomorrow or something I'm sitting here going why
[2234.56 → 2240.72] So it might be that they're managing the load on their side, but especially with the way that they are able to
[2241.68 → 2246.40] Share bandwidth between steam users though. I don't think that's been enabled over the internet yet
[2246.96 → 2249.84] Not yet, right Windows updates. I think
[2250.56 → 2259.12] Ah, definitely on a local network for both of them. Yeah, but I don't know if either of them are actually support sharing bandwidth over the
[2259.76 → 2261.52] internet
[2261.52 → 2263.52] Honestly, I don't know why not
[2263.84 → 2270.24] I would be down if it makes steam downloads way faster like two days from now. Yeah, exactly of that. I don't understand
[2273.68 → 2277.28] That's on purpose Windows update only offers certain updates to those who click again
[2277.60 → 2281.60] Um, yeah, I just wish there was more manual control over that like I wish I could say like
[2282.40 → 2287.44] Just give me it all. Yeah, and do it at this time so that when I go to use my computer
[2287.44 → 2291.44] You're not bothering me about anything. Yeah. Also don't bother me about anything. Yeah
[2291.44 → 2298.56] I do not want to change my browser preferences or whatever it is that you're trying to shove down my throat right now
[2298.56 → 2300.88] I yeah, I use windows because I have to
[2300.88 → 2301.84] I do
[2301.84 → 2302.16] Yeah
[2302.16 → 2303.60] Pretty much yeah
[2305.04 → 2307.04] Next up
[2307.04 → 2309.04] twitter charging users
[2309.12 → 2313.20] Windows update apparently does support sharing bandwidth over the internet. Yeah, okay
[2313.20 → 2314.80] So that's must be where I got that idea
[2314.80 → 2318.64] But no steam does not, yet that feature of steam is super cool though
[2318.64 → 2323.28] I was pulling a file at like over two gigabits from some other computer on my network
[2323.28 → 2328.64] Just yep. I don't need to download this from steam servers. I'm amazed. They didn't do it ages ago
[2328.64 → 2335.36] Maybe it's just not that common people having more than one gaming pc in a single house, but they like have roommates and stuff, right?
[2335.84 → 2339.12] I would think it's pretty common roommates are more common these days
[2340.32 → 2341.76] Yeah, I guess that's fair enough
[2342.88 → 2348.48] Yeah, I don't know, or maybe it was just complicated or maybe just no one at valve felt like working on that
[2348.48 → 2350.48] I
[2350.48 → 2354.56] Do want it to bother me before it reboots my computer without telling me yeah, that's not the point
[2355.84 → 2360.00] No, you can probably for a reboot. That's it rebooting your computer is bothering you
[2360.40 → 2364.72] Yeah, I said that he didn't want it to bother like man when I did the switch over to mac
[2365.28 → 2371.36] For what did I do a month or something like that like way, way back like nine years ago. Yeah, that was a month
[2372.08 → 2373.52] I was
[2373.52 → 2378.08] Blown away by how seamless the operating system update process was and this is almost
[2378.08 → 2380.80] 10 years ago. I would come in the morning
[2381.92 → 2386.72] Everything that I had been working on was tiled out exactly the way that I had left it
[2387.04 → 2395.04] Which is to say in a complete garbage fashion because I wasn't going to spend actual money on a third-party application to enable window snapping
[2395.76 → 2400.24] Ridiculous that they still don't have it. How is that even possible? Okay?
[2400.24 → 2401.04] It doesn't matter
[2401.04 → 2407.92] The point is I was blown away by how seamless the whole process was everything would be exactly where I left it and my operating system would be
[2408.08 → 2409.60] Up to date
[2409.60 → 2411.12] That simple
[2411.12 → 2417.28] How is it that in a world where the steam deck exists and the Xbox?
[2417.92 → 2419.12] exists
[2419.12 → 2423.12] With the excellent save state functionality that the Xbox supports?
[2423.52 → 2426.24] How is it that windows can't just put me back?
[2426.96 → 2432.00] Exactly where I left off. I actually don't I'm sure there's a perfect explanation for it
[2432.00 → 2436.80] I'm sure it's really hard like getting rid of the three different control panels that you have
[2436.80 → 2438.80] We're building a functioning search
[2443.28 → 2449.44] Just give me just give me Windows 7 search back. It was great. I know right just give me that don't even update it
[2449.68 → 2452.00] Oh, apparently macOS does have window snapping now
[2452.32 → 2454.96] Doesn't it suck though? I know there's still a third-party application
[2454.96 → 2460.32] I was like reading something recently where someone recommended like a good third-party window snapping tool
[2460.32 → 2462.32] So, okay, don't don't quote me on that
[2462.32 → 2464.88] I don't know if this is real or just something that Izzy is saying
[2464.88 → 2469.12] But Izzy said they enabled it because it lets steam deck users download games faster, which
[2470.00 → 2476.64] Totally makes sense. Okay, so that is a situation where you would have two devices. It was all about them. Just actually wanting to
[2477.68 → 2478.80] um
[2479.52 → 2481.92] It was all about them just actually wanting to do it then
[2482.80 → 2486.48] Being motivated by the whole Linux is the future of gaming
[2486.48 → 2491.04] I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if a developer took a really early version of a steam deck home
[2491.60 → 2493.92] And was like had to download stuff and was like, uh
[2494.72 → 2496.72] I already have this on my computer
[2496.72 → 2498.72] I should be able to get it from my computer
[2498.96 → 2505.68] And then they just and then built it in an afternoon like a crappy version of it, and then you know six months later. Yeah, huzzah
[2505.68 → 2507.68] Yeah, um
[2508.24 → 2510.24] How software gets born
[2512.00 → 2514.00] All right, um
[2514.00 → 2517.84] Shoot what was I looking for? Ah, I pulled up something. Oh, right right right right right right right
[2518.56 → 2524.40] That's a lot of rights speaking of valve. Okay. I tried reaching out pre I tried reaching out privately
[2525.28 → 2527.60] Um, it's time for me to take this public guys
[2529.28 → 2531.52] We need to talk about the steam hardware survey
[2532.32 → 2538.40] Oh, I thought you're going to say you're in a relationship. Um, no, okay. What's up? This is what I sent to valve
[2538.64 → 2539.52] um
[2539.52 → 2540.96] couple months ago
[2540.96 → 2549.20] Could the steam hardware survey please be updated to include the generation and approximate spec of a CPU rather than just the core count and frequency?
[2550.00 → 2555.12] The logic that valve used to split them out the way that they did make a lot of sense at the time core counts of one
[2555.20 → 2557.20] two four eight and other
[2557.20 → 2564.16] Helped guide the importance of developer efforts to multi-thread their games and provided insight into which consumers were buying entry mainstream
[2564.24 → 2569.52] Enthusiast and exotic CPU configurations one two four eight and others would have
[2570.40 → 2571.28] pretty
[2571.28 → 2573.28] Easily fallen into those categories
[2573.44 → 2581.52] Frequency at that time was a strong indicator of the per core performance again providing valuable insight to game developers and
[2582.32 → 2583.68] other people
[2583.68 → 2590.00] The issue is that over the last 10 years core counts have moved to the point where not enough cores
[2590.40 → 2594.40] is only a problem for thin and light laptops or very entry-level machines and
[2594.80 → 2600.08] Frequency is no longer the performance indicator that it once was and I sent them an illustration
[2600.64 → 2602.64] um
[2602.64 → 2608.16] So this is a graph from a non-tech showing the core i9
[2608.88 → 2612.32] 11 900k 12 900k and 13 900k
[2613.52 → 2616.32] These processors have only a
[2617.20 → 2619.36] 10 percent difference in frequency
[2620.00 → 2623.20] But a 30 difference in performance
[2623.20 → 2624.24] Um
[2626.72 → 2632.16] Now I know valve is whatever tool you're using can read CPU model names and numbers
[2632.72 → 2635.04] And I think it would be worth the relatively
[2635.76 → 2638.08] Relatively I know this would actually be a fair bit of work
[2638.32 → 2643.20] But I think it would be worth the relatively small investment to split CPUs by generations
[2643.84 → 2646.88] And families it's like 13th gen core i9
[2646.88 → 2652.80] If that's something they're interested in I would love to provide input I think the steam hardware survey is
[2653.44 → 2657.84] Incredibly valuable yeah, and and and this is my pitch
[2658.08 → 2664.72] This is my pitch for why valve should put actual time into it the steam hardware survey generates a ton of organic press coverage for valve
[2665.20 → 2665.68] Yeah
[2665.68 → 2670.88] And doesn't just help people in the media like me but also helps game developers and gamers
[2671.12 → 2671.36] Yeah
[2671.36 → 2675.28] It's it used to be a far more useful tool to look at and go okay
[2675.28 → 2680.24] Like what should I buy because you know that game developers are going to target the lowest common denominator?
[2680.48 → 2683.76] And so if you just go buy whatever super popular in the steam hardware survey
[2683.76 → 2690.40] Then you're probably going to be covered for at least some time period and honestly looking at the computer if you just built this computer
[2691.52 → 2697.84] Windows 10 64 bit 16 gigs of ram. Yep somewhere between 2.3 and 2.69 nice gigahertz
[2698.40 → 2703.84] six CPUs a 3060 eight gigs of VRAM 1080p monitor probably
[2703.84 → 2705.84] uh, you know
[2705.84 → 2707.76] You know 100 to 250 gigs of free space
[2710.24 → 2712.88] That'd be a pretty solid enough computer
[2712.88 → 2718.00] Yeah, play most games decently well, but there are going to be systems that would
[2718.64 → 2724.72] Meet those requirements like that frequency and core count 2.3 gigahertz that would be utterly unsuitable
[2724.72 → 2729.68] Yeah, so I think that it's a bit misleading in its current form and that's pretty much the only category
[2729.68 → 2733.52] Particularly around CPUs, which is why that's the only thing I actually brought up
[2733.52 → 2738.40] Yeah, I think it's a little bit misleading and I think it has the potential to
[2739.84 → 2748.08] Not be as useful as it was, and I mean, I don't I've never asked my permission or told me why they're making the steam hardware survey
[2748.08 → 2750.64] so this is all just based on my assumptions of
[2750.64 → 2751.52] of
[2751.52 → 2753.76] Why it exists for why it exists?
[2753.76 → 2760.72] I don't actually know that I just think that it is probably intended as a tool to guide developers to help them target
[2761.28 → 2762.08] the
[2762.08 → 2768.00] possible player base on steam a developer is working on the performance aspect of my game trying to
[2768.56 → 2773.84] Come into meetings where some other developer wants to implement a certain feature
[2773.84 → 2780.48] And I know that the performance impact of that feature is going to move the bar regarding what computer people would need to have
[2780.80 → 2785.44] If I know that that pushes that bar beyond that computer that we just stated
[2785.60 → 2789.68] That's going to give me a ton of ammo in this meeting to try to make sure that that feature is either
[2790.08 → 2795.84] Not done or done differently that is more performance friendly or whatever like this would be very helpful for actual
[2796.00 → 2798.48] Situations that actual developers are going to actually be in
[2798.48 → 2806.48] Actually, actually yeah, so actually is a garbage word that I overuse be great to an embarrassing degree
[2807.44 → 2810.32] Like I'm gonna actually explain to you guys how merch messages work
[2812.40 → 2817.12] Um merch messages are the way to interact with the show you can see your message down there
[2817.12 → 2820.16] You can get it replied to by producer Dan. You can get it rope. Sorry Dan
[2820.96 → 2822.48] You can get it replied to by us
[2822.72 → 2828.16] You can get it forwarded to someone here who can answer your question and the way to send one is not
[2828.88 → 2835.84] Via you know super chats on YouTube or twitch bits or whatever else we don't really support the whole throwing money at the screen
[2835.84 → 2837.84] I mean if you must do it
[2837.84 → 2841.52] I mean okay, I got employees to pay I got miles to feed sure fine go for it
[2841.84 → 2844.80] But the way that I see it you should get something for your money in case
[2844.96 → 2847.92] We don't see your message or just in general even if we do see your message
[2847.92 → 2849.36] You should just get something for your money
[2849.36 → 2852.96] So all you got to do is go on LTT store.com find something you like
[2852.96 → 2858.16] And in the cart you will see whenever we're alive a little box for merch messages, and it will send it over to producer Dan
[2860.48 → 2861.76] I think he's going to wave there. He is
[2862.48 → 2866.56] You can send it over to producer Dan who will curate your messages
[2866.56 → 2868.96] He's curated a couple to kind of show you guys how it works
[2869.12 → 2872.48] But before we read those I'm going to tell you guys about a couple updates on the store
[2872.80 → 2875.36] We've got one new product that I think is
[2875.36 → 2879.76] Which is amazing and super cool and makes a ton of sense meet
[2881.60 → 2883.60] The dropout yeah
[2884.72 → 2886.72] Which we both are
[2887.28 → 2889.28] Well, that's that's the joke
[2891.36 → 2893.36] Uh, it's an it's kind of a
[2894.40 → 2900.64] college university styled um sweatsuit so we've actually got a hoodie
[2900.64 → 2905.44] Ugh and matching sweatpants available in a couple of different colours
[2906.08 → 2907.28] but for people who
[2908.40 → 2909.28] didn't actually
[2909.84 → 2912.00] graduate from post-secondary or who just
[2912.96 → 2915.04] Just plain think LTT is kind of cool
[2915.60 → 2917.60] um
[2917.60 → 2919.60] It's actually really comfy. Well, of course it is. It's
[2920.64 → 2923.04] Why are you surprised? This is like okay
[2924.72 → 2929.36] Every time I was working on a video earlier this week, okay, and you know Sam from the lab, right?
[2929.36 → 2933.20] Okay, audio guy. Yes, okay. He's doing a before and after
[2933.76 → 2938.80] recording with the hats so if you're not familiar a hat is a head and torso simulator
[2938.80 → 2943.36] Which is a deceiving name because unless you pay the extra like 80 000 for the torso
[2943.36 → 2946.16] It doesn't actually have a torso. It's just a head so it's a
[2947.12 → 2951.44] Pass doesn't matter the point is it's a head like this, and it has microphones in the ears
[2952.00 → 2956.16] And we used that to allow you guys to experience
[2956.16 → 2959.52] a surround sound demo that we were doing in a video
[2959.84 → 2962.32] So I replaced that wireless soundbar
[2962.72 → 2964.08] HTA 9 thing that had the
[2964.64 → 2968.16] Audio issues the wireless interference or like the cutting out problems
[2968.56 → 2971.44] I replaced it with a wired surround setup
[2971.84 → 2979.52] And we wanted to find out well how magic is Sony's magic that they did with the ht-a9 where you can place them basically anywhere
[2979.52 → 2985.76] And then they'll use microphones on all four of the units to figure out the shape of the room and correct for it
[2986.48 → 2991.76] Um, so Sam sets up the sets up the hats, and then he plays back both files for me
[2992.96 → 2996.32] And I immediately go okay. Yeah, that's that one and that's the other one
[2998.24 → 3000.24] What zipper pockets yeah, of course
[3000.24 → 3002.24] Well, I don't want things falling out of your pockets
[3002.24 → 3008.16] Ladies and gents, I know I got you sweat pants man. Why do sweatpants not have zippers on the pocket?
[3008.48 → 3014.72] Everything falls out of the pockets. I have its drives me crazy. I can't wear clothes that don't have oh even the back one
[3014.96 → 3018.00] Of course even the back because if it has a zipper you can always
[3018.64 → 3023.36] Undo the zipper yeah, but if it doesn't have a zipper. What are you going to do sew a zipper on come on?
[3023.36 → 3025.36] I
[3025.68 → 3028.64] Sweet maybe like three percent of you maybe
[3029.60 → 3031.60] Maybe I'd even say less
[3031.60 → 3036.96] I didn't know that people are into stuff. They're crafty. Yeah, a lot of hobbies. They're hobbies. All right people anyway
[3036.96 → 3042.48] You win this round. So I go yeah, it's this one. This one was the Sony one and this one is the new system, and he goes
[3042.88 → 3044.88] Oh, wow, I'm so surprised
[3045.36 → 3046.40] Come on!
[3046.40 → 3048.40] What do why do I get no credit around here?
[3048.40 → 3052.56] It's not that you have comfortable clothes and I can tell which surround system is which one
[3053.12 → 3057.52] So there because oh your ears not trained like to clarify
[3058.24 → 3062.56] The surprise is that it is yes, it is comfy, but it is also different comfy
[3062.72 → 3065.92] I don't think this is the same as previous sweaters we've released
[3066.88 → 3071.20] No, we put a lot of work into doing a lot of things differently every time, and probably it's stupid
[3072.32 → 3074.48] Yeah, maybe a little bit but no it has a different
[3074.96 → 3081.28] It is it's different. Yeah, it feels good. It has more of like a college hoodie fit like that's that's kind of the goal
[3081.28 → 3087.36] Yeah, it does have the same french terry interior that some of you I know don't like, but I like a lot because I find it
[3087.36 → 3089.36] Is it actually the same?
[3089.36 → 3093.44] No, I'm not sure if it's the same. I don't think it's the same style. It's a little softer
[3094.08 → 3098.08] Yeah, yeah, but some people don't they just don't like it at all. They prefer the brushed inside
[3098.48 → 3103.04] Oh, and I've had people accuse us of like being cheapskates for that or what it's it doesn't
[3103.04 → 3106.80] I the cost is the same. I just I personally prefer me to
[3108.16 → 3113.76] Um, anyway, so we've got that, and then we've got a weird one
[3114.80 → 3116.80] um
[3116.80 → 3118.80] Oh, yeah, I
[3118.80 → 3123.76] Was asking what this was before the show. Okay, well, why don't you start by showing them to the people?
[3123.76 → 3129.92] We have controller
[3131.60 → 3132.00] Controller
[3134.64 → 3135.36] What else you got?
[3136.48 → 3137.04] I have
[3139.68 → 3140.16] Controller
[3142.64 → 3147.28] Next to my oh for focus. Okay, I understand what else you got I have
[3147.28 → 3151.20] Controller so far we've done
[3152.32 → 3155.60] Uh, Nintendo Xbox and this is Sony
[3156.72 → 3158.72] And what else you got
[3159.68 → 3161.68] Other more different Nintendo
[3162.72 → 3170.24] Or uh unspecified controller non-copyright infringing wooden square desk ornament. Yes
[3172.08 → 3173.36] Can I tell you about this?
[3174.16 → 3174.56] Yes
[3175.68 → 3178.16] What if I said what would happen if I said no?
[3179.36 → 3181.20] Yes, I would tell you about it anyway
[3182.08 → 3184.08] Wait, did you hold up every single one of them?
[3184.56 → 3186.56] Backside
[3186.56 → 3188.24] What you put the logo forward?
[3188.24 → 3195.12] Yeah, oh, I mean you don't have to it's on me now. Sorry. Uh anyway, there's little LTT logos in where um
[3196.16 → 3200.00] Uh a box shaped like a letter that's laid in the alphabet
[3200.00 → 3204.56] IP circle thing might have been um anyway, the point is
[3207.20 → 3212.48] The original genesis of this which ironically we don't have one in the shape of uh was
[3212.48 → 3215.28] Us
[3215.76 → 3217.92] Releasing the shape sorter toy
[3218.72 → 3222.48] And someone who had just started on the engineering team not really
[3223.12 → 3231.12] Having any idea what our process is, and how complicated it is for us to release something because we are so obsessive about quality of everything
[3231.68 → 3235.92] Saying you know what would be cool is if we had like a teething toy
[3235.92 → 3241.20] I've seen these like wooden teething toys, okay, um, and if we have like little kid or like baby stuff
[3241.20 → 3243.44] That would be that would be a cool, you know thing
[3243.76 → 3245.76] What if I bet it would be really fast and easy?
[3245.76 → 3248.88] We'll just like get in touch with someone who can you know make okay?
[3248.88 → 3253.68] Anyway, the point is a year later the project completely morphed
[3254.32 → 3258.48] Um now it's no longer a teething toy because it has a clear coat
[3258.48 → 3260.48] I was going to say yeah, yeah
[3261.84 → 3267.60] And instead it is intended to be here. Hold on. I'm just gonna we're on the site here like ornaments. Um, yes
[3268.32 → 3273.20] Instead it is a cool ornament. Okay. We need to work on our word wrapping. Uh, oh
[3275.20 → 3278.48] Controller our ornament at least that are is a soft one
[3282.00 → 3284.48] Description enhance your nostalgic
[3284.48 → 3290.64] Decoration game with our controller ornaments made from beech wood and finished with a hard wax oil finish
[3291.28 → 3297.84] As well as an LTT logo on one side they give you the option to rep the brand or keep your decorations sleek and smooth
[3298.80 → 3301.52] No mounting hardware or other accessories included because
[3302.48 → 3304.48] full transparency
[3304.72 → 3306.72] We didn't want to
[3306.72 → 3312.24] Just yeah, we weren't really sure double-sided tape. I don't know, but yeah, just place it on a shelf
[3312.24 → 3316.00] They're just I don't know. They're just kind of cool. So when we got them we went look
[3316.00 → 3320.24] I don't think this is a teething toy especially at the cost like it just was kind of high
[3320.48 → 3324.24] But they're really nice, and we were like, oh, that's cool. What are the minimum order quantities?
[3324.24 → 3327.84] Let's not order that many and maybe people would just want these as just like
[3328.56 → 3333.68] cool like, you know rep your favourite controller gamer decorations or something like that to your
[3334.56 → 3338.80] Younger sibling when they want to play console games with you. Yeah, and then laugh at them
[3338.80 → 3344.40] Yeah, you could you could like to paint them you could do whatever that'd be kind of cool. Yeah, I don't know
[3344.72 → 3349.20] Yeah, it's an it's a weird it's a weird product. Yeah, Uber fuzzy says double-sided tape. They are going on my wall
[3349.28 → 3353.12] Yeah, I did I know that for look it's something that doesn't exist
[3353.60 → 3357.92] Yeah, for better for worse it now do I think it's almost cool as like an art thing
[3358.00 → 3362.48] I could see some really cool designed painted ones personally. I don't know
[3363.36 → 3368.16] Um, yeah, NATO. Yeah, leave it to twitch chat to bring this up. Do not stick body parts through them
[3369.52 → 3370.80] Please
[3371.12 → 3375.68] Thanks. Yep. Good. Cool. We're all on the same page about that. Someone's going to try it
[3386.16 → 3387.84] Oh boy, what's up?
[3389.04 → 3391.04] Everything is fine
[3391.68 → 3396.48] Should I know no, no yeah, no everything is fine. Oh, uh, all right
[3396.48 → 3399.84] What's that? We don't have to if you don't know. No, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it
[3400.32 → 3402.80] Then we'll do a couple merch messages. Oh, you can throw them
[3403.92 → 3405.92] Underhand
[3405.92 → 3407.92] He's not even he's
[3408.32 → 3410.32] Oh
[3410.32 → 3414.32] Okay, wait, isn't that one already announced? No, this is not well
[3414.32 → 3420.00] Okay, it depends on who gets their way as far as nick or I are concerned. This is not a product
[3421.76 → 3424.88] But if the engineering team gets their way it is a product
[3424.88 → 3428.00] So do you want to go ahead and show the people I love it?
[3428.16 → 3428.72] Oh
[3428.72 → 3431.20] Oh my god
[3432.16 → 3432.88] This is brilliant
[3432.88 → 3434.48] Can you
[3434.48 → 3436.40] It's brilliant. I know, but you can show the people
[3436.40 → 3437.76] So there's a bit loadout
[3438.72 → 3442.96] Like a soft silicon bit loadout on what do we call these the short lanyards?
[3442.96 → 3445.84] I forget short lanyard call it whatever okay on a short lanyard
[3446.00 → 3450.96] So if you had multiple bit loadouts for different reasons, you could have these on like hooks or organized in whatever way
[3450.96 → 3452.24] And then just take whichever one you need
[3452.24 → 3457.76] I was thinking a bandolier like you could wear shoulder to hip amazing just magnet them on this obviously has to be a thing
[3458.24 → 3463.60] So here's my issue. I don't know if Luke is messing with him. We're going to Linus cam. We're going to Linus cam
[3464.96 → 3466.96] We are working on a bit of storage
[3467.60 → 3474.24] Thing of some sort like a clamshell thing that's you know got nice magnets in it, and it is hard case and all that kind of stuff
[3474.64 → 3480.32] Um, it's going to take a little while because of injection moulding and lead times and all those things that take time
[3480.88 → 3485.04] this is something that with the experience that we gained from the
[3486.00 → 3488.72] uh stick locks we actually
[3490.48 → 3494.40] Could produce relatively quickly and if paired
[3494.40 → 3500.32] With our little shorty lanyards that we have uh, which are available in a variety of colours
[3500.88 → 3505.04] Could allow you to with a single colour of silicone bit holder
[3505.76 → 3508.96] Colour code your different sets of bits. So if you had like a torn
[3509.36 → 3512.32] Match met yeah, torn metric hacks imperial hacks
[3512.88 → 3513.92] um
[3513.92 → 3517.44] It would be quick and easy to find those issue
[3518.48 → 3520.08] Is that these do exist by the way?
[3520.08 → 3527.20] Um, but the reason we would need to do a different one is because they a don't really work very well with our bits and be our engineering team
[3527.20 → 3531.68] Didn't find any that they were happy with my issue with this is that
[3533.20 → 3536.32] They don't really stay in as well as I would like okay
[3536.32 → 3541.28] And I'm worried that they'll loosen over time and our general product philosophy is that magnets in the back
[3542.00 → 3544.40] Well, then it's not cost
[3545.12 → 3548.32] Effective anymore, and it's also not simple to develop anymore
[3548.96 → 3554.40] So my issue is that it sort of violates our product development philosophy
[3554.40 → 3558.40] Which is to build things that don't have a foreseeable failure point
[3559.68 → 3561.68] While this is weird
[3563.84 → 3566.72] And it raises a lot of questions about why does it exist
[3567.52 → 3573.28] Right you could ask about any ornament. I don't think it doesn't it doesn't violate the product development philosophy. It's not
[3573.28 → 3573.92] Oh
[3576.00 → 3579.76] If it just broke that would have actually been hilarious. No, I broke the table
[3581.20 → 3584.24] I specifically asked you not to do that
[3584.24 → 3584.80] He did
[3584.80 → 3592.32] He 100% did. I don't know if they can see it. He totally did. He totally did. Oh my god
[3592.32 → 3596.32] It's smashed
[3603.04 → 3605.60] Because that's not an LTT product
[3605.60 → 3607.44] I mean
[3609.04 → 3613.92] We don't sell it. No, no, no, no, we don't sell it. We don't sell it might have been made by us. We don't sell it
[3616.24 → 3618.24] How am I going to explain this one
[3618.24 → 3621.20] I'm gonna you have to tell mom
[3621.84 → 3622.24] Um
[3623.60 → 3624.48] Anywho
[3624.48 → 3625.60] I'm not drinking right now
[3626.24 → 3626.48] Sorry
[3626.48 → 3627.36] Not the right time
[3627.36 → 3627.60] So
[3627.60 → 3628.88] My table
[3628.88 → 3635.52] Are we supposed to pull this or like what back to this thing?
[3635.52 → 3636.40] You know what they're going to say
[3636.96 → 3638.96] I understand your argument
[3638.96 → 3639.12] Yeah
[3639.68 → 3640.72] So is it
[3641.60 → 3643.60] Not overcomeable? It's not going to be a thing
[3643.92 → 3646.80] Well, okay. No. Well, we're taking community feedback
[3647.20 → 3650.08] And like this is the danger right because I know what you people are going to say
[3650.08 → 3650.96] They're all just going to want it
[3650.96 → 3652.24] You're going to say yeah do it
[3652.64 → 3653.12] Um
[3653.12 → 3654.88] Them falling out too easily is a
[3654.88 → 3660.72] A problem, but I don't want to like I don't want to trust me bro guarantee this because I know it's not going to last forever
[3660.72 → 3662.40] And I hate manufacturing
[3662.40 → 3664.56] So it's just going to get weaker over time. That's the problem
[3664.56 → 3670.40] Yeah, anything everything does right, but at least you know with something like with something like clothing, you know
[3670.40 → 3672.64] We can test for that we can say okay
[3672.64 → 3676.24] Well, here's what we think is sort of a reasonable lifespan for our garment
[3676.48 → 3682.32] Whereas something that holds your tools and just sits and holds them and is like kind of stretched out eventually
[3682.32 → 3686.00] Yeah, I don't want it to wear I don't want to be buying a new one all the time
[3686.40 → 3688.24] um, and I feel like these would be
[3689.12 → 3691.12] Relatively disposable
[3691.20 → 3694.48] Is my concern and no there would not be a way for us to
[3695.36 → 3696.48] to alter this
[3697.12 → 3701.04] Paradigm might be this might be too much information for the show, but do you have a
[3701.92 → 3703.92] price estimate?
[3703.92 → 3705.92] Oh, they'd be I don't know like
[3705.92 → 3707.92] I
[3709.04 → 3713.52] In volumes of one they'd probably be like 10 bucks for this and the lanyard
[3714.08 → 3717.28] I suspect that this would be a product where if you bought five of them
[3717.28 → 3721.04] We'd probably have to figure out a way to code some kind of price break into the site because
[3721.60 → 3723.92] I could definitely see that because we can do that because
[3724.48 → 3726.40] Like we have fixed handling costs on every order
[3726.40 → 3730.72] So if you order one of something we still pay handling costs on it
[3730.72 → 3736.16] We actually cannot just sell things on our store for 199 or whatever it just it doesn't work with our model
[3736.64 → 3738.32] Um, but if you bought five of them
[3738.56 → 3742.00] I don't see why it would cost that much more like maybe that would be like
[3742.00 → 3743.92] I don't know like 15 bucks or something like that
[3743.92 → 3750.08] Like I don't know the actual injection moulding cost or the actual cost per injection moulded part is almost nothing
[3750.08 → 3753.52] Most of the cost would be in the development and in the end in the handling
[3753.52 → 3756.16] Yeah, um, and then the lanyard itself
[3756.72 → 3763.76] Um, it's this is a funny one even with the higher quality box stitch on here
[3763.92 → 3767.68] Like you know how every lanyard just has like a super cheap like single um
[3769.52 → 3775.92] What it would seem right no not a seam whatever you just the one line across yeah sewing single sewing line sure um
[3777.04 → 3781.68] The cost of this with the box stitch with the metal hardware
[3781.68 → 3787.36] Uh with the nice clasp that doesn't wear out is still like a couple bucks or something like that
[3788.00 → 3792.40] um, so anytime that you encounter a lanyard that is
[3793.28 → 3801.12] Cheap and crappy know that they saved at most like eight cents on it like it's its baffling to me. It's really frustrating
[3801.68 → 3803.68] um
[3804.00 → 3804.88] So
[3804.88 → 3807.92] That's all I have to say about that. Let's not pull it. Let's just kind of
[3807.92 → 3813.36] People saying that they wouldn't buy it with the lanyard
[3813.44 → 3818.24] I think if that's true you would want to wait for the like clamshell one
[3818.88 → 3824.96] I don't think this is something you would want just sitting on a shelf in its current state. No, I could see throwing it into a toolbox though
[3826.40 → 3830.24] We probably wouldn't be able to do a ton of different colours though unless we did an um
[3830.24 → 3835.92] Um, oh man, I can't remember the different kinds of injection moulding that we explored for stick logs
[3836.56 → 3841.60] Uh, there 's's one kind where it's really, really easy to run different colours
[3842.16 → 3845.44] And there's basically no setup and then there's another one where there's a ton of setup
[3846.48 → 3850.56] Um top gear says don't make it spend the money and time on fast tracking the real bit holder
[3850.56 → 3857.36] There is no fast tracking that though. This wouldn't actually delay that much. This is our design like this is already designed
[3857.84 → 3863.12] Uh, it's just a matter of sending it over to the same injection older that did the stick locks for us probably
[3867.36 → 3869.60] I don't know you know what let's just leave it there for now
[3872.80 → 3877.68] Oh, yeah, this is another one people are talking about the carabiners when we finally get them all manufactured and ship them out
[3877.68 → 3882.08] Uh ship out the replacements, um, tine was asking me should we just sell these things?
[3882.80 → 3885.92] This the same carabiners that we have for the backpack
[3886.48 → 3886.80] um
[3887.68 → 3893.92] Slightly larger are like 30 or something like that on some seller we found for a similar carabiner like each
[3894.16 → 3895.20] Do you remember this conversation Dan?
[3896.48 → 3900.32] What about the uh about selling the carabiners? Yeah, do you remember what I said?
[3903.20 → 3907.36] I don't think so yeah, that we should sell the carabiners. Do you know what Linus said?
[3907.68 → 3913.04] What did Linus say? No, I wanted to buy the carabiners. I like it. Is it just cooler because Tynan said it?
[3914.00 → 3916.00] It sounds smarter when Tynan says
[3916.88 → 3920.08] That's why I respect it. That's why I respect Linus because he does that
[3922.88 → 3929.76] Look I'm i I am changeable my opinions are changeable. I want one for my jacket if I hear a good argument for something
[3929.76 → 3936.08] The zipper's been broken for months. That's not a good argument. That's not my problem Daniel.
[3936.08 → 3938.16] Full point dot remembers. But I can't buy them
[3939.44 → 3943.52] I mean look you can just have one. Do you need one? I'll give you one. It's the principle of the matter
[3943.52 → 3947.04] I'll give you one off my backpack right now. He's going to take one off his backpack. I already have a prototype
[3947.52 → 3949.68] No, I'm not. I don't have the tool for I don't have the tool for removing
[3949.68 → 3951.68] Yeah, you can't remove them. You're not supposed to do that
[3951.68 → 3956.56] But if you sold them. Oh guys, no, they're not climbing rated. Okay. Now. I remember why I didn't want to do it
[3956.56 → 3958.96] I don't want people doing anything stupid with them. They're decorative
[3959.68 → 3960.88] No
[3960.88 → 3965.36] I now oppose it again. Good job, Luke. All right. I'm just going to go see some more good. I'm just well
[3965.36 → 3970.08] Okay, now we have to make that. Oh, no tine's watching. Oh, come on
[3970.96 → 3973.68] Why does everybody at work watch the show?
[3974.24 → 3977.92] Well, it used to be that it was the only way we could figure out what's happening at the company
[3977.92 → 3983.36] But now we fix that so yeah for some reason they do this for fun at least I get paid for it
[3983.36 → 3985.92] You guys bizarre what is wrong with you? I mean Luke doesn't
[3986.64 → 3988.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[3988.64 → 3990.64] I legitimately don't oh, no
[3991.68 → 3995.60] You actually have the worst WAN show deal yeah out of everyone at this table
[3995.60 → 4000.00] I don't even have to like look you guys in the face because at least I can say pretty please
[4000.88 → 4004.40] Pretty please buy the dropout please, and then I get to make more money
[4005.12 → 4010.96] And then Dan, I mean yeah, he makes it over time. Yeah, he gets overtime like every time like when we're late for WAN show
[4010.96 → 4012.96] It actually costs yeah, because like I mean
[4012.96 → 4017.68] So please buy some more dropout. He used to be like five to ten hours a day
[4017.92 → 4023.52] And now I come in at one so as an adjusted shift, but at this point we need to adjust your shift to like
[4024.08 → 4025.68] 3 p.m. Or 4 p.m.
[4026.00 → 4032.56] My mornings already ruined. I might have just start working like 15-hour Fridays. It was fun. Yeah, I miss it
[4033.84 → 4040.00] Anywho, let's go ahead and let's go ahead and do a couple merch messages, shall we? Oh, yeah, that's right. That's my job
[4040.00 → 4047.44] Uh, I am here for a reason. Uh, what are some examples of tech making a process longer or more tedious?
[4047.52 → 4052.72] I recently saw a kid touch the screen instead of pressing tab when putting in their user and pass name
[4053.36 → 4055.04] password
[4055.04 → 4057.04] See both of those are tech though
[4060.00 → 4062.00] See that's a tough one
[4063.36 → 4065.36] Tech making things
[4065.36 → 4068.00] Take longer. Okay. Okay. Um
[4070.00 → 4071.12] I
[4071.12 → 4073.12] Generally hate printing anything
[4075.20 → 4084.00] Printers almost because I use them so rarely almost every time I use them, you know, I have a friend. Sorry, I have a show-off who works in
[4088.48 → 4090.48] Oh my god, not my point
[4090.48 → 4091.60] Um
[4093.60 → 4101.76] They work in uh, like high-end printer and copier sales and support and I mean like they've sent me pictures of a copier that
[4103.28 → 4108.40] It looks like an assembly line like it's this whole wall along this the viewers can't see it
[4108.40 → 4109.60] But it's longer than this wall
[4109.60 → 4114.40] Uh, but the whole wall from like this corner all the way to that door is one long continuous
[4114.40 → 4120.00] Does it like copy every side and bind it together, and I'm sure it can do everything under the sun
[4120.16 → 4123.84] It can laminate things automatically throughout the process. It can do
[4124.64 → 4126.40] crazy colour
[4126.40 → 4130.48] Stuff that you like can't normally do, and it can do like copy protection things
[4130.80 → 4136.00] Okay, and all this crazy stuff that is interesting and whatnot and
[4136.64 → 4138.64] still
[4138.64 → 4141.84] A huge portion of their job is support
[4142.64 → 4144.64] Because printers are crazy
[4144.64 → 4146.64] Like oh my goodness
[4146.72 → 4153.52] It's the least interesting but actually I attended a like a sales training thing back when I was at NCI once
[4153.52 → 4158.48] It was basically just propaganda from hp. I think it was hp don't quote me on that
[4158.48 → 4162.40] But I think it was hp for why nobody should use anything but authentic ink
[4163.36 → 4165.36] But within that propaganda
[4165.36 → 4172.56] uh bulls**t presentation there were a lot of fascinating tidbits about printer technology and how
[4172.56 → 4177.12] Actually flipping complicated it is like hard drives like we take them for granted, and they're boring
[4177.28 → 4181.44] You learn anything about how they're made it's like oh my god how do these things function at all
[4182.00 → 4187.20] Yeah, yeah like for any amount of time like I remember like okay, we we just kind of
[4187.76 → 4193.36] Dish terms like 7200 rpm, and we just talk about these things it was real casual right like
[4193.36 → 4196.72] uh, but think about it on a
[4197.60 → 4200.40] three inch platter or whatever the actual um
[4201.52 → 4202.48] uh
[4202.48 → 4206.88] Circumference diameter that would be the diameter would be three inches
[4206.88 → 4211.04] I don't whatever the point is on a three-inch platter or however big those stupid things are
[4211.52 → 4215.68] uh, the circumference of that of the outer tracks at
[4216.24 → 4217.68] 72 7
[4217.68 → 4226.40] 1200 rpm I remember someone from WD explaining this to me. It's basically like a like uh like the the the arm
[4227.36 → 4235.12] Trying to accurately move over this spinning disc is like an is like a bug trying to fly in a hurricane
[4235.44 → 4239.60] Like three inches above the ground or something like that like the amount of precision is
[4240.48 → 4241.84] mind
[4241.84 → 4247.60] Blowing it's pretty nuts. Um and honestly whatever the thing we're supposed to be talking about right now is
[4248.24 → 4250.24] What was it printers right? It's?
[4251.52 → 4259.84] It's not that different like in order to blend these pigments with the kind of accuracy to achieve the level of
[4260.24 → 4265.12] Vibrancy and the level of detail that they do how fine these drops are and how
[4265.68 → 4270.72] The methods that they use to control them particularly in higher-end printers. It's just it's
[4271.60 → 4276.08] It's so advanced. It's indiscernible from magic to me like it's really incredible
[4276.72 → 4280.16] But man, do I ever hate them and man are they ever boring?
[4280.16 → 4285.12] I think printers are a great example of something that just genuinely makes things take longer for me than
[4285.12 → 4290.00] I could literally just write it out and hand it to someone sometimes for how long it takes me to print a document
[4290.72 → 4291.28] um
[4291.28 → 4296.08] I still thought it was fascinating that neither of us had any problems with the printers at the Linux challenge
[4296.80 → 4302.08] I know that was so interesting couldn't believe that that was wild. I was sure that that was going to be a problem
[4302.08 → 4308.00] So clearly it's Microsoft they're holding back printers. They're the problem to advance, you know digital communication
[4308.00 → 4308.96] That was a bit their agenda
[4308.96 → 4314.96] It was to make MSN more powerful than you can possibly imagine and then and then their monster turned against them. Oh, no
[4316.00 → 4317.04] I don't know
[4317.04 → 4320.64] Yeah, so about that. How did we get on this stuff? Is this a merch message? Yeah. Yeah
[4320.64 → 4326.24] Yeah, it was uh, oh, yeah, you were gonna something that technology has made slower and less convenient. Oh
[4326.96 → 4332.08] Man, Wi-Fi calling is so unreliable. I swear. I had fewer dropped calls
[4332.88 → 4334.88] back in like 2005
[4335.20 → 4335.52] How about this?
[4335.52 → 4337.52] Than I do now phone
[4338.08 → 4342.64] Oh, but they make so many things so much faster. Yeah, but calling. Oh, yeah
[4342.80 → 4346.16] I mean calling is definitely slower on a modern phone. No doubt
[4346.16 → 4353.04] It's more what do you think is more popular?
[4354.16 → 4356.64] Controller ornament or the dropout?
[4358.32 → 4362.48] Controller ornament by a long shot. Yeah, what do you what is this?
[4363.20 → 4365.76] I don't understand it. This is a really nice sweater
[4365.76 → 4373.12] Like we put real work into real products that are perfect. This is a real product and you guys buy memes people buy ornaments
[4373.12 → 4376.00] I know I just I've never understood it
[4376.00 → 4382.08] Honestly, it's we probably underpriced these like I went to I went to some store that had ornaments
[4382.40 → 4386.08] And I buy underpriced. I don't mean compared to what they cost us or whatever
[4386.24 → 4387.28] Or is it just a Vaughn?
[4387.28 → 4388.08] Organization?
[4388.08 → 4393.36] Uh, no, not organization. Decoration, decoration, decoration. Oh, no heavens' no. Yeah. Yeah, why would I do that?
[4393.36 → 4395.52] So that's not for you. No, I know. I know. Well, yeah
[4395.52 → 4399.52] But look the point is I went to a store, and I was blown away by how much things cost
[4399.60 → 4401.28] It was like it was like that's a ball
[4402.16 → 4405.68] Like it's a ball. What does it do? It goes on a table. What do you mean? It just goes on a table?
[4406.00 → 4410.56] That's all it does. Yeah, no what I'm gonna it's like eighty dollars
[4411.76 → 4415.52] Whoa, oh, do you have any idea how much ornaments cost?
[4415.92 → 4422.72] That's pretty cheap for me either. I don't decorate my house either. You're shopping at Walmart for your table balls. It's wild. It's wild
[4423.76 → 4429.12] Like you ever go to like a home sense or something and that's the cheap one. Dan's like secretly a table ball elitist
[4429.12 → 4434.48] Oh, we used to know this interior designer and she was like, oh, you're this we're putting this cheap couch in
[4434.48 → 4436.56] It's like seventy-five thousand dollars
[4437.20 → 4440.48] And like her table balls would be like at least three hundred dollars
[4441.76 → 4444.96] Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's insane. So anyway ten bucks
[4446.24 → 4448.24] That's what I think it's worth
[4448.72 → 4451.36] Wait, they're ten bucks? Yeah, they're ten bucks. That's not too bad. Yeah
[4452.00 → 4457.36] I mean that there would they made a beach would there were some woods that were going to be more than ten bucks
[4458.16 → 4461.28] Um, but we decided to start with beach and see how it goes
[4461.60 → 4465.44] You should do like you shouldn't actually do this, but it'd be kind of funny. Maybe you should do it
[4465.44 → 4468.72] I don't know. Oh look, it's a fidget toy. I'm undecided. But seriously buy the drop
[4468.72 → 4471.84] Oh look, it's a fidget toy. Everything we make is fidget toys
[4473.04 → 4478.56] It's great. You should do like you know albums go platinum and stuff. You mean the Christmas album?
[4478.56 → 4483.44] You should make like if a product tries to go platinum new Christmas album
[4484.08 → 4489.68] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, he's actually serious about this. Sorry. What are you talking about? We can tangent to that if you want
[4489.68 → 4495.68] Ah, I don't want to talk about it. Okay. I haven't been informed about this. No, but you probably will be if we do it
[4496.00 → 4501.68] Um, okay, we should talk. Uh, yeah, I was going to say we'll probably need him on the team if we want to make this happen
[4502.08 → 4504.32] Um, uh, what was I going to say?
[4505.04 → 4508.16] Something I was going to say something. You know how albums go platinum
[4508.80 → 4510.80] Right, okay, so
[4510.80 → 4515.28] See I listen. If you is a product sells a certain amount you should like make a
[4516.32 → 4517.60] one
[4517.60 → 4519.84] unique fancy version and then keep it
[4520.72 → 4522.64] Oh, yeah, that'd be kind of cool. So like if this
[4522.64 → 4524.64] If this is the wall or something. Yeah, yeah
[4524.64 → 4528.00] So if this just like goes gang busters, you should get like some old one
[4529.04 → 4534.24] Or like just maybe it'd be unique per product. So it'd be like a very fancy wood or something. That'd be a lot of gold
[4534.24 → 4539.44] Um, the problem is that the development cycle of making one
[4540.72 → 4544.16] Is just as complicated sometimes as the cycle of making
[4545.04 → 4552.00] More than one so almost anything that is worth us developing is worth putting for sale unless we can't hit the Moss
[4552.24 → 4556.24] In which case we'd probably know that pretty early in the process, and then we just shouldn't spend time developing it
[4556.40 → 4560.48] Right. So I see where you're coming from, but I think that's pretty tough
[4561.12 → 4564.88] Yeah, and that's part of the reason why I said you probably shouldn't do it float plane chat caught me
[4564.88 → 4566.88] I totally put body parts in the wood controller
[4567.60 → 4569.60] I had already done it
[4569.76 → 4573.68] Before the like first thing I did was shove it in here and then go
[4575.60 → 4577.60] It's a very important cylinder
[4577.60 → 4579.60] That's an unusual technique
[4579.60 → 4581.04] The sounds
[4582.08 → 4582.80] The sounds
[4583.60 → 4588.56] Whatever. I'm going to read another merch message. That was only one merch message. Sounds good. Hey you all
[4588.64 → 4594.72] I'm scared of an all-electric future as someone who works in a parking lot all day quiet cars scare me
[4594.96 → 4598.96] Linus, do you think there are any technologies that have any unforeseen consequences?
[4599.76 → 4601.76] What about an artist version that's not sealed?
[4601.76 → 4608.24] I think you should pay like artists to do custom one-off versions because would you have to sand this down to paint it?
[4608.72 → 4610.00] I actually don't know
[4611.20 → 4613.20] That's a good question
[4617.52 → 4623.44] So technology that scares us technologies with unforeseen consequences. I mean good gravy. I mean everything right like
[4623.44 → 4627.60] This is not an unforeseen consequence. Um, I had a weird moment today where a
[4628.40 → 4631.68] System that we are working on developing that I will not disclose
[4632.56 → 4633.04] I
[4633.04 → 4639.28] Was informed uh by one of my people that dolly 3 was released. So I wanted to use it. Oh
[4640.16 → 4641.44] So I asked a question
[4642.32 → 4648.56] And didn't realize that the way you access dolly 3 is through chat gpt4 you do it through the chat gpt4 system
[4648.56 → 4652.16] You don't go to a specific thing for dolly 3. I didn't realize you have to turn that on
[4653.12 → 4656.00] So I prompted it about this new feature that we're going to build
[4656.64 → 4657.84] Um
[4657.84 → 4660.08] And what were you trying to get out of an image generator?
[4661.36 → 4665.76] Uh, the like design yeah, like oh, okay, um, because I was just wondering like I wonder what it does
[4666.40 → 4667.28] because
[4667.28 → 4673.36] uh, it was so the person I was talking to was Jayden and Jayden uh asked it for something that he was working on
[4673.44 → 4678.48] Which is more different than the thing I asked it about, and it output like literally Netflix
[4679.04 → 4681.20] Because it was a something in relation to do with float plane
[4681.20 → 4687.84] So we were asking about like online video streaming and stuff and it output literally Netflix with literally Netflix's logo in the corner
[4688.00 → 4690.00] And we were like, whoa
[4690.40 → 4694.56] That's a little on the nose. Um, so I went and asked it about another thing that
[4695.12 → 4697.12] Another one of my teams is working on
[4697.12 → 4699.12] um, but I didn't turn on
[4700.08 → 4705.60] I prompted it like an image generator. Yeah, but I didn't turn on the thing that allows it to generate images
[4705.60 → 4711.68] So it just responded in text about what it would do to make this platform in the way that I described it
[4712.40 → 4714.40] And it literally
[4715.20 → 4718.00] Named a feature that we have come up with
[4718.64 → 4721.44] With the exact name that we came up with for the feature
[4722.16 → 4725.12] That is not a feature that is available on any site that I know of
[4725.12 → 4731.52] I
[4731.52 → 4734.48] Like literally sat there with a shattered brain for a little while
[4735.12 → 4737.84] It's like are you kidding me? This is nuts
[4738.48 → 4742.24] And like you know, I can see why you're keeping this super la secret right now
[4742.48 → 4744.48] Yeah, as you've seen on
[4744.80 → 4749.44] LTT store and as you've seen sometimes if you've heard the naming of things from my teams as well
[4749.44 → 4751.04] This is not just a LTT store thing
[4751.04 → 4756.32] Sometimes our naming schemes for things are not necessarily the most creative so it's not like wood controlling
[4756.80 → 4758.40] What do we call it again?
[4758.40 → 4760.40] Controller ornament, I think
[4762.48 → 4764.64] So it's not the most creative name in the world
[4764.64 → 4768.08] So it's not like impossible that it could have come up with it, but it's still like whoa
[4769.04 → 4771.04] It came up with this feature idea
[4771.04 → 4773.04] despite it not being a thing that people do
[4774.24 → 4778.08] And it's named the same way that we named it very interesting. Yeah, I was reading um
[4778.80 → 4784.96] Buddy some guy I forget his name but released a book about how humans have no free will because
[4785.68 → 4788.24] we are basically just uh, you know a
[4789.36 → 4793.84] a pot of chemicals and uh, you know impulses and all that kind of stuff
[4794.40 → 4794.72] um
[4795.68 → 4801.92] And you're talking about you know, how easily we can be sort of predicted I guess in this way
[4803.04 → 4804.56] I don't know that's a little bit of uh
[4804.56 → 4808.72] My whole this is a crazy rabbit hole to go down, but my whole thing is
[4809.20 → 4809.52] um
[4810.40 → 4814.00] You need to actively influence your future
[4816.72 → 4819.68] Actions if that makes sense you need to influence your future actions now
[4819.68 → 4821.04] Like your future chemistry
[4821.04 → 4825.60] You need to take the right steps now so that you'll do automatically the right things later
[4825.60 → 4830.56] But you'll only take those steps now if you are sufficiently motivated to take those steps now
[4833.12 → 4837.28] It has to be nice to future you yeah, we're not going to get into that today. Yeah
[4838.80 → 4842.88] Yeah, I think you're like your past actions are almost more impactful than you're at the moment
[4843.20 → 4845.20] um decision-making at times
[4845.76 → 4849.20] Anyway, that's an interesting take. Thank you for sharing it. Yeah, moving on
[4849.20 → 4850.40] That's one
[4850.40 → 4852.40] Two more topics Dan asks for
[4853.20 → 4854.32] Twitter
[4854.32 → 4857.36] Yeah, we'll be charging new users sick a
[4858.40 → 4865.36] $1 per year subscription in New Zealand and the Philippines in what they are calling the not a bot program
[4865.36 → 4870.00] Let's go according to twitter the subscription would bolster their already
[4870.48 → 4872.48] significant efforts to reduce spam
[4872.88 → 4879.12] Manipulation of our platform and bought activity. I wonder how that's going for MMO platforms. These users will also need
[4879.12 → 4886.64] To verify their account with a phone number. This is a quote here new users who opt out of subscribing will only be able to take
[4887.04 → 4890.96] Read-only actions such as viewing posts and watching videos
[4891.44 → 4895.60] It is unclear from the announcement why the rollout is only for these two specific countries
[4896.08 → 4900.64] But I am going to say something that sounds like it's going to be very unpopular and say this seems like
[4901.52 → 4903.52] an effective
[4903.52 → 4904.80] if
[4904.80 → 4906.80] maybe um
[4906.80 → 4912.64] Even if it has the potential for unintended consequences' idea
[4914.08 → 4916.96] Extreme systems.org is an old school
[4917.52 → 4918.96] overclocking
[4918.96 → 4925.76] extreme cooling forum the second I originally read this topic however many days ago it came out because I knew about this one happening I
[4926.40 → 4928.24] Immediately thought about extreme systems
[4928.24 → 4931.68] So Fugger the site admin what a name
[4932.48 → 4938.56] Yeah, I don't know whatever basically old school legend in the extreme cooling and overclocking scene
[4939.12 → 4939.68] um
[4940.64 → 4947.20] Just couldn't keep up with the amount of spam and crap on the forum and eventually for all new signups
[4947.28 → 4952.00] So it wasn't for existing accounts for all new signups implemented a one dollar
[4952.00 → 4954.00] I think it might have even been one time
[4954.00 → 4959.76] I don't think that it was a subscription don't quote me on that but implemented a sign-up fee and said that it
[4960.32 → 4962.08] immediately and
[4962.08 → 4963.04] forever
[4963.04 → 4965.04] eliminated spam from the site
[4965.68 → 4968.08] The only problem with that is that as far as I can tell
[4968.64 → 4971.20] basically none of you know what extreme systems is
[4971.68 → 4973.68] because
[4973.68 → 4978.96] It's pretty much a ghost town over there. They do still have a small community from what I can tell
[4979.28 → 4985.36] I haven't signed on in quite some time. I just almost never see anything linked there or anything like that
[4986.00 → 4986.80] um
[4986.80 → 4988.72] I mean maybe yeah. Yeah, they're look at this
[4989.76 → 4991.76] Hey, they're uh
[4991.92 → 4994.64] Still kicking extreme systems.org. Yeah, here it is
[4995.36 → 5000.96] You have to register before you can post click the register link about registration is a one dollar to post on this forum
[5001.60 → 5003.60] um
[5004.24 → 5009.68] Let's see virtual and augmented reality last posted August 24th 2020
[5011.12 → 5015.12] Okay, but here's something more recent from a couple of weeks ago
[5017.60 → 5019.84] Yeah, okay, it's pretty slow
[5022.16 → 5024.32] I'm trying to think what were some of the more active
[5025.20 → 5027.20] uh, oh, okay
[5030.72 → 5033.44] Hmm how many just control f 2023
[5033.68 → 5039.68] Yeah, most sub forums have been posted in this year
[5040.24 → 5042.32] Uh, some of them are not visible if you're not signed in
[5043.04 → 5045.76] Oh, so that's something to watch out for like I think there's some
[5046.32 → 5052.16] Just chit-chat ones, but you can just tell there are things that generally have not been kind of looked at in a while
[5052.16 → 5053.76] I don't think
[5053.76 → 5057.76] Anyone is looking for information about a bit motherboard support in the last
[5059.20 → 5061.20] 10 years 13 years
[5062.08 → 5062.56] um
[5063.36 → 5067.84] To be clear. I don't know what path would have worked better for them. I loved that community
[5067.84 → 5072.24] I learned so much of what I know there, uh, super, super knowledgeable people
[5072.80 → 5077.84] uh, really, uh, really really really passionate community in its prime
[5078.32 → 5080.56] Um shout shout out Martin's liquid lab
[5080.88 → 5081.20] um
[5082.72 → 5083.04] but
[5085.92 → 5087.52] And I understand they had a problem
[5087.52 → 5088.24] um
[5089.60 → 5094.48] With spam and bots. I mean we run into a lot of the same things on the LTT forum, and maybe it was just kind of
[5094.48 → 5101.84] It was too niche for them to have a large enough moderator team to handle that stuff without closing down battening the hatches
[5101.84 → 5106.48] uh batting something down the hatches. I just um
[5107.60 → 5113.84] I think that twitter is probably going to run into a similar situation if they roll something like this out more broadly
[5114.88 → 5118.48] I doubt that those particular countries are
[5119.36 → 5123.36] You know an especially large source of scammers and spammers on the platform
[5123.60 → 5127.04] What I suspect is that they're just small markets where they can run this test
[5127.52 → 5130.96] And see if it's effective in any way for some period of time
[5131.60 → 5133.60] but um
[5133.76 → 5137.68] I suspect we already know what the conclusion is and that is that this will be
[5138.64 → 5140.16] so damaging to
[5141.28 → 5146.48] Overall user engagement that any upside which would be a reduction in bots for real
[5146.48 → 5148.56] I think they would see a significant reduction in bots
[5149.36 → 5151.76] any upside would be outweighed by the
[5152.64 → 5159.20] Loss of momentum on their platform that keeps twitter still relevant after all this time like there are
[5159.84 → 5163.84] I go on it far less than I used to but there are certain things that
[5164.64 → 5168.32] Twitter is better at than anything else like the uh, the sniper wolf
[5168.32 → 5170.64] controversy that happened over the last week have you heard about this?
[5171.20 → 5173.92] Uh vaguely yeah, she talked someone or something. Yeah, she
[5174.80 → 5176.72] Literally went to
[5176.72 → 5180.48] Jacks films's house and posted a video in front of it asking her
[5180.48 → 5183.12] Criticized them or something all the way around sorry
[5183.12 → 5189.60] Yeah, yeah, because he called her out for just being a reaction streamer which has become very controversial over
[5191.84 → 5195.60] Pretty much since the WAN show where we talked about launching a React channel
[5195.60 → 5200.48] Like dark viper was already kind of interesting dark viper was already talking about it before that
[5200.48 → 5204.00] But I feel like a lot of momentum has picked up
[5205.04 → 5207.04] In that time which is sort of funny
[5207.20 → 5211.52] Literally what to be clear. I am not saying that it's because of us
[5212.48 → 5214.48] I am just saying that I'm
[5214.56 → 5218.24] The timing is very interesting by the way. I found a fatal flaw in this product
[5218.24 → 5224.24] I managed to rip through the little loop already so we would probably have to embed some kind of reinforced
[5224.80 → 5228.24] uh material in the loop part of it which is going to complicate the
[5228.72 → 5230.32] shooting the moulds and see this is
[5231.28 → 5235.12] This is how every product we develop ends up taking a year or two because you break it
[5235.52 → 5240.24] Yeah, which is good because it's better for me to break it than for you to break it. Yeah, that's fair enough
[5240.24 → 5242.24] It just means everything takes forever
[5243.44 → 5245.44] Try not to break the table again
[5245.44 → 5251.52] So anyway, yeah, I feel like I talked a lot about this. Um any thoughts?
[5254.64 → 5258.40] Oh my god, Sebastian not Linus in float plane chat
[5258.96 → 5261.92] One of orange one of our people who works in the engineering department
[5261.92 → 5267.28] I don't know if he's technically an engineer because that's a protected term in Canada and if you like to use it wrong engineers get mad
[5267.84 → 5272.24] Um, yeah, he might be an engineer. I don't know. Uh, doesn't matter. He does engineer things
[5272.24 → 5277.20] Uh, he says that prototype is full of bubbles people mad too and made in 30 minutes
[5278.32 → 5279.20] Okay, Sebastian
[5279.92 → 5282.56] I get it. I get it. I get it. He's he is
[5283.28 → 5285.28] a strong proponent of
[5285.60 → 5292.88] This particular how long is it going to take do you think for one of these to wear out to the point where bits are gonna fall out of them?
[5292.88 → 5294.88] Oh
[5295.36 → 5299.92] Honest answers only Sebastian when it's not made in 30 minutes. Yeah, and doesn't have bubbles in it
[5300.80 → 5303.28] Yeah, when it passes QC. Yeah
[5305.20 → 5310.96] In the meantime while he responds, uh, I don't care about anything that happens on Twitter
[5310.96 → 5312.96] I
[5313.60 → 5319.44] Find it all hilarious. I found it hilarious when they change their name to x I find this hilarious
[5319.92 → 5322.08] If this kills it I'll find that hilarious
[5322.80 → 5330.24] Um, if this makes it boom in activity I'll find that hilarious. Okay, that's just everything that happens. I think it's funny at this point, which is
[5331.68 → 5336.88] I am happy that I feel this way because I think it is just so much better. Um
[5336.88 → 5342.48] I don't know. I think it's funny. They're gonna start charging people to use the site that people hate the most
[5343.44 → 5345.44] That's that's hilarious. Um
[5346.08 → 5348.24] I think it's I think it's I don't think it's gonna work
[5348.40 → 5351.36] I think it's wild how Mark Zuckerberg
[5351.92 → 5359.92] Has in my opinion been probably the biggest beneficiary of twitter turning into even more of a flaming dumpster fire, and I'm not even talking about threads
[5360.24 → 5362.24] I'm just talking about how
[5362.40 → 5363.36] how
[5363.36 → 5364.64] broadly
[5364.64 → 5371.36] Hated he was yeah, and how it seems to like him it seems to be turning around
[5371.92 → 5379.68] Yeah, the guy who said when people shared their information with him through making Facebook accounts. He called them effing idiots people like that guy
[5381.04 → 5385.76] Well, it's all fascinating. It's all relative. Yeah, you don't have to be a good billionaire
[5385.76 → 5390.80] There's a big or bad. You just have to not be the worst one. Yeah, because there's only enough attention and focus to go around
[5391.28 → 5394.88] Pretty much very interesting. Uh, but yeah, I don't think this is going to do anything
[5394.88 → 5396.88] I think you don't need to look any further past
[5397.44 → 5399.44] Bots and MMOs to see why
[5400.16 → 5406.40] These bots are buying accounts and paying active significantly more subscription dollars than one dollar. I disagree
[5406.40 → 5410.16] There is a form of monetization to be had the bots will go for it
[5410.32 → 5415.52] There is state funded money behind bots on Twitter. Okay, that's they do not care. Oh
[5415.52 → 5423.12] About one dollar subscriptions speaking of which okay, this is something that I asked for to be in the dock this week
[5424.48 → 5426.48] Did it not end up in here?
[5426.88 → 5428.88] Did they not put in my thing?
[5431.12 → 5433.12] Dang it
[5434.56 → 5439.28] Yeah, it's not gonna change much it might change some things I suspect
[5439.28 → 5444.00] Hilariously enough, I suspect it might get rid of the terrible bots
[5445.52 → 5451.68] But it's going to keep the like perfect ones which might actually increase the effectiveness of the good bots
[5452.08 → 5453.20] Because if people are
[5453.84 → 5458.24] More trusting of the platform because they believe there are fewer bots or no bots
[5459.44 → 5461.92] They'll believe the good bots more, so I don't know
[5462.32 → 5463.44] Okay
[5463.44 → 5468.80] Speaking of bots, I had a fascinating experience. I'm sorry. I'm changing the topic here a little bit
[5468.80 → 5475.92] Um, I was for some reason trying to find information on the that
[5476.24 → 5480.56] That Huawei Mate 60 with they're the new Byron 9000s processor
[5480.56 → 5486.00] So this is that that all china all the time chip that allowed Huawei to launch a
[5486.96 → 5489.76] You know purportedly flagship tier or at least
[5490.40 → 5491.44] premium is tier
[5492.48 → 5493.44] smartphone
[5493.44 → 5494.48] so it's
[5494.48 → 5499.28] Um, apparently according to some experts according to hot hardware
[5499.76 → 5506.24] um 14 nanometre grade in terms of the technology even though they are claiming that it's a
[5506.40 → 5507.76] a 7 nanometre node
[5508.24 → 5508.64] um
[5509.44 → 5514.40] It seems more in line in terms of performance with you know 14 nanometers is
[5514.88 → 5518.32] uh, or I mean maybe not maybe it's just kind of um kind of
[5518.32 → 5519.12] a
[5519.68 → 5521.68] Not as good. Um
[5522.32 → 5525.68] 7 nanometre design. I don't know doesn't matter the point is
[5527.12 → 5531.20] I was reading about it and I wanted to see okay. What do people think?
[5532.32 → 5537.04] Uh is kind of you know what's going on what do people on hot hardware think and this
[5538.08 → 5540.24] was one of the most brazen
[5541.12 → 5543.12] blatant
[5543.12 → 5547.92] examples I think I had ever seen of bot activity just
[5549.28 → 5551.20] Just obvious bot activity
[5551.76 → 5557.92] Outside a major site like twitter, and it was really eye-opening in terms of how
[5558.96 → 5560.00] the Chinese
[5560.88 → 5561.28] um
[5562.00 → 5565.12] propaganda machine oh, yeah works and how
[5565.52 → 5569.60] broadly it is trying to influence opinion outside
[5569.60 → 5577.12] Of the obvious targets I guess because I don't I don't generally delve into the comment section that often
[5578.24 → 5580.56] But like look at these comments
[5581.28 → 5585.52] Bill asks is there any phone that can make satellite call?
[5586.08 → 5586.32] No
[5586.96 → 5590.24] Is us afraid to Huawei development? Yes
[5590.80 → 5594.16] Then above article is not believable 28 thumbs up
[5594.16 → 5601.12] Life as josh hot hardware.com is not a scientific journal
[5601.12 → 5603.12] None of their results should be considered true
[5603.12 → 5607.84] They do not post their methods or variables for testing nor do they have the resulting values peer reviewed
[5608.24 → 5612.72] Hot hardware.com is an entertainment publisher. They make money like any other website through ads
[5613.60 → 5614.48] True
[5614.48 → 5620.96] Performance is not just numbers. It is about functionalities. If you need to crunch number there are more supercomputers on the market
[5620.96 → 5622.96] This is
[5622.96 → 5624.40] This is
[5624.40 → 5628.24] Incredible because as far as I can tell these are not bots
[5629.20 → 5632.32] These appear to be human written comments
[5632.96 → 5634.56] based on talking points
[5635.76 → 5637.28] Interacting with each other
[5640.96 → 5643.36] I mean this is a thing we know that's a thing for sure
[5644.32 → 5646.80] The uh, I don't know what they call it, but the whatever farms
[5646.80 → 5648.80] Sorry
[5648.80 → 5652.80] Sorry, there's there are pictures of them. They're just like yeah. Yeah. Oh, like content farms. Yeah
[5653.36 → 5659.44] The table above clearly has an agenda to disrepute Huawei Mate 60. It should be viewed with suspicion
[5662.16 → 5666.56] This seems to be an actual person getting downvoted by bots. Uh, anyway, it was
[5667.36 → 5668.72] this article just
[5669.52 → 5671.04] stood out to me because
[5671.84 → 5673.52] almost the entire
[5674.08 → 5676.08] comment section
[5676.08 → 5677.20] Is just
[5677.20 → 5678.08] Chinese bots
[5678.72 → 5679.84] interacting with each other
[5680.32 → 5686.16] About not bots or sorry. Yeah, or in or from what I can tell more likely
[5686.80 → 5689.92] Actual people typing these messages because the
[5690.56 → 5697.04] They are different enough from each other in terms of their mastery of English for example in terms of their tone
[5697.52 → 5702.00] In terms of the way that they approach the talking points that I really don't think it's a LLM
[5702.00 → 5704.40] I think it's actual individual users
[5705.20 → 5705.60] um
[5706.88 → 5707.68] Just
[5707.68 → 5711.92] Creating this wave of spam about an article that isn't even
[5712.48 → 5714.08] It's not even trashing on it
[5714.40 → 5715.92] Like if you look at the article itself
[5715.92 → 5719.04] This is what's really kind of mind-blowing to me
[5719.36 → 5722.08] If you look at the article itself, it's pretty objective
[5722.56 → 5726.08] Here's what it is. It has some semi-custom arm cores
[5726.96 → 5730.24] Here are the benchmarks relative to some other phones. It's
[5731.28 → 5735.20] They're not trashing on it, but they are calling out things that are not true
[5735.44 → 5740.08] Huawei talks a lot about AI and machine learning, but we found little to no optimization for machine learning
[5740.72 → 5741.68] um
[5741.68 → 5744.08] The GPU doesn't do particularly well
[5745.28 → 5750.96] And the performance, uh, it can't compete with the latest mobile SOCS or even many that are years old still
[5750.96 → 5755.52] We are impressed that the Byron 9000s exists at all in a few years
[5755.52 → 5759.28] Their domestic chip manufacturing has ramped up despite lacking access to western technology
[5759.68 → 5761.68] Uh, like it's its a pretty
[5762.56 → 5766.48] Balanced positive even article talking about the future capabilities
[5767.36 → 5769.52] But somehow this ended up on the hit list
[5770.72 → 5771.12] and just
[5772.24 → 5773.52] Yeah, don't god. Yeah
[5776.00 → 5779.92] And like okay, I just want to be I just want to make it clear like this guys
[5779.92 → 5782.88] I'm not it wasn't just like four or five messages like this is
[5784.64 → 5786.08] It goes on for quite a while
[5789.28 → 5796.32] Like this is not this is a pretty um poorly written comment, but it's probably not from a
[5796.32 → 5798.32] Content farm
[5799.04 → 5800.40] Yeah, yeah pretty much
[5801.12 → 5803.84] Um, okay some of these are some of these are newer
[5805.68 → 5809.36] No mention of satellite link in the article that distinguishes Huawei from the rest
[5811.68 → 5817.84] Anyway, all right, sorry that this is a totally, totally unrelated thing with the satellite so we can do satellite calls
[5817.84 → 5822.88] Yeah, I might have some kind of satellite calling, apparently. I mean look the system works
[5823.44 → 5830.64] Yeah, we are now investigating the satellite calling functionality of the Chiron 9000s. I mean, I don't care about it, but
[5831.68 → 5836.08] It might have it, but now you're learning about it, and you are broadcasting it to
[5836.08 → 5845.04] X amount of people some number of people float plane doesn't have a viewer count got them get owned don't eat it
[5846.48 → 5848.00] Fine
[5848.16 → 5851.92] Every time he every time I bring this up. He's like do you want it, and I'm like
[5852.72 → 5858.56] How long will it take how much will it cost a lot, and I'm like, okay forget it. Yep. Sounds good. Yeah
[5858.56 → 5864.40] That's kind of how that goes nice also won't be accurate because getting around ad blockers is really annoying. Yeah, that's fair
[5864.40 → 5869.28] Okay, what else you want to talk about? Oh, oh balls sponsors, right?
[5872.08 → 5878.08] Sponsors the sponsor my balls really expensive table balls is what he's talking about. Yeah, yeah table balls dot com
[5878.96 → 5880.96] Okay, please don't me that's not a thing. Nope
[5880.96 → 5885.36] It's going to read it's good. It's going to redirect LTT store soon enough
[5891.12 → 5893.12] Table balls dot com
[5897.12 → 5905.76] Oh my god, I'd hate to think of what you would find on that site don't go there if someone made that like an actual curated site for buying ornamental
[5906.56 → 5908.56] table balls
[5908.56 → 5910.48] That would be that would be peak
[5910.48 → 5915.04] Well, it ain't a million-dollar business idea, but it's maybe a thousand-dollar business ideas
[5915.44 → 5921.04] Yeah, great. Yeah, as in it's going to cost you a thousand dollars to get it up and going and then no one's ever going to buy it
[5922.08 → 5927.76] Um, let's maybe do sponsor spots the show is brought to you today. We don't use go daddy. We don't use go daddy. Thrum

[6036.48 → 6043.60] Oh, hi, Dennis a few of our team members also use ag1 including Luke who wanted to make sure he wasn't missing out on certain vitamins after switching his diet
[6044.08 → 6048.16] If you're looking for a simpler investment for a simple investment for your health try ag1
[6048.24 → 6054.00] And you can get five free ag1 travel packs and a free one-year supply of vitamin D with your first purchase
[6054.32 → 6056.32] So just go to
[6056.32 → 6062.32] Drink ag1.com slash wan show that's drink ag1.com slash wan show to check it out blind spot
[6063.92 → 6065.92] Oh
[6065.92 → 6067.92] My chat pointed out
[6068.00 → 6069.92] The show is also brought to you by see sonic
[6070.24 → 6072.80] These are much shorter talking points because see sonic men
[6073.28 → 6077.28] They know you already know who they are just buy a power supply there. That's it. No, I'm kidding. There's some stuff
[6077.60 → 6081.12] See sonic has been a long time partner for us here at leg and for good reason
[6081.12 → 6085.04] They make some great power supplies like the focus go 750
[6085.20 → 6087.60] It's fully modular and uses a hybrid fan
[6087.60 → 6094.16] So you have less noise without worrying about increased temperatures and their entire focus go line is 80 plus gold rated
[6094.16 → 6096.16] So, you know your system is running efficiently
[6096.64 → 6101.92] See sonic they're not trying to sell you a power supply with RGB or gaudy colour options
[6102.16 → 6107.12] They just want to make something you can count on and that shows in their 10-year warranty and customer support
[6107.12 → 6111.44] So keep them in mind for your next build at sea sonic.com or at the link down below
[6113.12 → 6115.44] Merch messages. Oh, sure. Yeah hit me, Dan
[6116.32 → 6118.32] Okay, let's see
[6118.48 → 6120.32] Yo, LLD I work in the year
[6121.04 → 6126.24] I work in the Air Force as a computer scientist and there has been a topic that worries me. I
[6126.96 → 6128.96] think
[6128.96 → 6130.96] I think
[6130.96 → 6132.96] Hold on there we go
[6132.96 → 6137.44] Uh, yo, LLD I work in the air force as a computer scientist and there has been a topic that worries me
[6137.44 → 6140.80] What are your thoughts on the use of AI in deadly war machines?
[6141.04 → 6141.84] IE
[6141.84 → 6143.76] Targeting and or firing. Oh, yeah
[6144.72 → 6146.32] Oh, yeah terrifying
[6146.32 → 6151.04] Terrible. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We talk about hallucinations all the time. Yeah. Uh-oh
[6151.12 → 6153.36] Now question for you. Mm-hmm
[6153.36 → 6155.84] And I'm to be clear I'm not talking to us military right now
[6156.48 → 6158.64] Given the prevalence of drug use
[6159.36 → 6164.08] In militaries around the world. Yeah, what are the odds of an AI hallucinating versus a soldier?
[6165.76 → 6167.04] Wow topics we
[6169.04 → 6170.32] Should not go deeply into
[6173.68 → 6174.32] But is
[6175.84 → 6177.76] Valid not entirely wrong
[6180.96 → 6181.52] Shake hands
[6183.28 → 6183.84] There you go
[6188.64 → 6190.64] Oh
[6190.64 → 6192.64] Yes again, Danny
[6192.64 → 6194.64] Okey-dokey
[6194.64 → 6198.16] Please what I would more like to see it in is defensive properties
[6198.80 → 6202.08] Missile warning systems things like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[6202.80 → 6209.04] Yeah defence but actually defence. Yeah, not the kind of defence where it's like the best defence is a good offence defence. Yeah, I know
[6209.68 → 6211.68] Yeah
[6211.68 → 6217.84] Please leg I'm begging you for any information you can give me on the precision screwdriver any eta
[6218.40 → 6218.96] possibly
[6219.84 → 6225.44] Um, I think we are hoping to get it out in the first half of next year as for the information
[6225.76 → 6230.16] Right now. We're still waiting on moulding for the bit holder that goes inside the handle
[6230.16 → 6236.24] I think there are some stretch target functionalities that we would have liked to have that we're still kind of torn on
[6236.24 → 6239.52] So if we were to try for some new functions that might delay it
[6240.00 → 6246.00] Um, I think that'll pretty much come down to whether or not we decide to launch alongside bits
[6246.56 → 6247.68] To be clear again
[6247.68 → 6251.20] I want to reiterate our goal is not to go up against everyone else who
[6251.76 → 6254.56] sells a precision screwdriver kit. I think ours is going to be
[6256.40 → 6257.92] Not cheap
[6257.92 → 6266.08] But it will have some functionality that I think is going to set it apart in the market if people are looking for something very premium
[6266.48 → 6269.92] And our intention is to make the driver available by itself
[6270.24 → 6276.96] So you could just alter your foam a little bit and your existing kit continue to use your probably perfectly good bits and just
[6277.36 → 6280.96] Chuck our driver in as a more as a more premium or even just an extra
[6281.44 → 6283.12] um as an extra driver
[6283.68 → 6287.92] Um, what I suspect is that we should have no problem hitting that target
[6287.92 → 6293.60] But you know if you're hoping to have something to you know have under the Christmas tree that's not happening
[6296.72 → 6304.00] What technology would you like to see in motorcycle helmets or bikes themselves I'd like to see better heads-up displays in visors
[6304.72 → 6307.28] I mean, yeah, that's the most obvious one to me
[6307.92 → 6312.00] um, I think you know on the subject of things that AI could potentially be really good at
[6312.00 → 6318.48] I don't necessarily need my vehicle to operate itself for me, but if it could provide helpful advice
[6318.96 → 6323.44] um, particularly with respect to defensive driving, I think that that's something that
[6324.56 → 6333.36] We could all benefit from if everyone was driving more defensively if you're not familiar with the term defensive driving refers to a driving technique
[6333.68 → 6341.92] That minimizes the risk of uh of a collision or a mishap by taking proactive steps
[6342.16 → 6343.68] to prevent them so rather than
[6344.24 → 6351.52] Reacting to something bad that happens trying to keep yourself perpetually in a position where it would be more difficult for something bad to happen
[6351.52 → 6352.96] It's not always possible
[6352.96 → 6361.28] but an example of a defensive driving technique that I use on my motorcycle is that I will almost always avoid being
[6362.00 → 6363.68] next to a car
[6363.68 → 6365.68] If I can not be next to a car
[6365.76 → 6368.00] Especially at speed and at speed is
[6368.00 → 6370.72] If I can not be able to avoid it, I can not be able to avoid it
[6370.72 → 6377.76] Because you're not you shouldn't be bumper to bumper ripping down the highway at you know 60 miles an hour 100 kilometres an hour right?
[6378.24 → 6378.56] Um
[6378.56 → 6384.24] So I will make sure if I'm passing someone if I have to be next to them
[6384.48 → 6386.48] I am going to give them a wide berth
[6386.48 → 6387.76] I'm going to go as far
[6388.40 → 6389.84] Around them in my lane
[6389.84 → 6393.04] So I have the buffer of the space beside them in their lane
[6393.04 → 6396.96] Plus the space that would be beside a car in my lane plus the width of a car
[6397.52 → 6401.36] I have all that buffer if they decide to suddenly change lanes because they don't see me
[6401.84 → 6402.08] Um
[6402.80 → 6404.24] They shouldn't hit me in time
[6404.56 → 6405.20] I tend to
[6406.32 → 6408.08] Okay, and this might just be being like an
[6408.64 → 6409.68] um
[6410.56 → 6412.24] Motorcyclist, but I tend to pass quickly
[6412.80 → 6416.40] So I will check make sure you're not signalling make sure you're not doing anything
[6417.20 → 6420.08] I don't hang around beside someone any longer than I have to
[6420.08 → 6425.04] And then I will put myself in a position where there's absolutely nobody next to me on either side
[6426.08 → 6428.08] um
[6428.72 → 6431.44] There's a ton of examples of that and I think that
[6432.24 → 6440.00] Even people who want to operate their own car or don't have a car that operates itself whether it's due to lack of cameras or whatever the case may be
[6440.32 → 6442.24] I think that having real-time
[6443.36 → 6448.80] Coaching for how people could drive more defensively would be enormously beneficial maybe actually
[6448.80 → 6454.32] Man, yeah, why didn't I ever why haven't how have we never talked about this before what a great
[6454.88 → 6456.88] middle step that would be
[6457.44 → 6461.44] So instead of just going straight to trying to build autonomous vehicles
[6462.40 → 6469.60] If we built vehicles that advised you on how to better drive your car because we are still information years away
[6470.32 → 6475.76] Years away from vehicles even the ones that have the hardware like all the cameras and onboard processing
[6475.76 → 6481.92] That might theoretically someday have them capable of fully autonomous driving no user intervention
[6482.48 → 6482.72] um
[6483.60 → 6489.20] We are years away from them actually needing no user intervention. I think that'd be a super cool way to use it in the meantime
[6491.52 → 6497.52] Yeah, Sancho bingo chronicled says what about a blind spot indicator that tells you if you're in someone else's blind spot?
[6497.52 → 6503.76] Yeah, that'd be or just if there's like super cool feature not necessarily a reckless driver because we don't necessarily want
[6504.32 → 6505.12] uh
[6505.12 → 6506.72] these systems like
[6506.72 → 6511.60] Stating that people are doing things that are illegal. Uh, but if they're like there's a high-speed vehicle
[6512.24 → 6519.44] Approaching from behind, and you're on a bike. Yeah, that'd be nice to know. Yeah, or I noticed the car in front of you
[6520.00 → 6525.36] Is swerving all over the lane? Uh, the operator may be impaired in some way
[6525.36 → 6529.44] Keep your distance. Give them a little bit of space. Yeah, that's a big one. I look for that all the time
[6529.44 → 6532.80] There's literally on my way to work today. There was a big
[6533.44 → 6535.60] Lifted truck that was just constantly
[6536.48 → 6541.28] You know listing to the right listing to the right listing to the right tire goes off-road, and they go
[6541.92 → 6545.92] And they get back in their lane, and they did that over and over and over and over again
[6545.92 → 6549.60] I just sat way back because I was like, I'm just not gonna mess with this
[6550.08 → 6554.24] It feels like there's a pretty high chance you're gonna crash and I don't want to be right next to your vehicle when it happens
[6554.24 → 6556.48] Um, yeah, I don't know
[6559.52 → 6562.72] Oh more topics cool. Yeah, let's do topics. What do you want to talk about Luke?
[6565.92 → 6572.00] Well, you told me not to read the doc so let me scroll through this real quick. How about the terrible no good very bad King Kong game?
[6572.00 → 6574.00] Yeah, what the
[6576.08 → 6581.68] Skull island rise of Kong launched this week and has been hailed as a contender for the worst game of the year
[6581.68 → 6585.04] Despite retailing for fifty dollars skull islands
[6585.84 → 6592.96] Bland beat-em-up combat lazy animations and odd graphics have been compared unfavourably to the 2005
[6593.52 → 6597.52] Movie tie-in peter Jackson's King Kong as well as golem
[6597.92 → 6601.12] 2023 that game that we hated a few months ago and mostly forgot about
[6601.84 → 6607.52] In one widely circulated cutscene the enemy model is briefly replaced with a static JP
[6607.52 → 6613.20] Okay, hold on you have to watch this. I need to see this. You have to watch this. No, I got it. I got it. I got it. Furthermore, I got it. Okay
[6613.36 → 6615.36] Um, here we go
[6628.00 → 6629.36] What is happening?
[6629.36 → 6632.24] This actually looks like it's from 15 years ago. Yeah
[6637.52 → 6639.52] Wow
[6640.88 → 6641.60] No way
[6642.56 → 6645.36] The rock smash there is I know
[6646.40 → 6647.44] I know
[6647.44 → 6650.08] Aren't they not coming out of where the ground would be either?
[6650.72 → 6652.16] Like if you look at the height of
[6653.76 → 6657.84] Not that this matters at all, but I think he's smashing the air and rocks are coming out of it
[6658.88 → 6660.00] uh
[6660.00 → 6664.00] Anyway, um a long-form gameplay walkthrough posted by
[6664.00 → 6673.84] MK ice and fire shows repetitive combat over a short endless loop of generic bongo music an early cutscene interrupts a
[6674.48 → 6678.56] playable character landing on the ground causing an impact sound to frantically
[6679.44 → 6682.72] To frantically repeat over and over again during the cutscene. Wow
[6683.52 → 6689.60] The publishers game is literally the sorry the publisher's name is literally game mill
[6689.60 → 6695.76] You can't make that up. That's amazing. That's like EA
[6696.32 → 6701.60] I'm sure I've told you this before but EA's mobile game company. Yeah, it's called capital games
[6704.16 → 6706.16] Did it did you guys know that
[6708.88 → 6711.52] That's actually the most amazing name
[6712.40 → 6715.68] Like whoever came up with that and then the board was just like oh
[6716.48 → 6723.92] Yeah, like what we don't know we don't get the joke. It's so on the nose. Oh, it hurts so amazingly on the nose
[6724.48 → 6726.48] I just beautiful
[6726.48 → 6728.48] Oh, wow anyway, um
[6728.48 → 6730.48] Our discussion question is
[6730.56 → 6732.96] How is it that veteran IPS?
[6733.84 → 6736.96] Keep having these terrible video game tie-ins?
[6738.16 → 6739.36] especially
[6739.36 → 6742.08] Especially when they've done good ones in the past?
[6742.80 → 6749.60] Is this just people not understanding that gamers are not just going to buy whatever shovelware you crap out?
[6750.32 → 6751.52] I don't know
[6751.52 → 6753.68] Like how does something like this go from?
[6755.12 → 6756.40] discussion
[6756.40 → 6758.08] to green-light
[6758.08 → 6758.88] to
[6758.88 → 6761.04] Development milestones to release
[6761.68 → 6763.44] How is that even possible?
[6763.44 → 6765.52] Honestly, I didn't understand this
[6765.52 → 6769.92] Um, I saw this very shortly in my Google News feed earlier this week
[6770.48 → 6773.92] Um, but I thought people were just mad because like the graphics weren't great
[6774.56 → 6775.68] And they're really not
[6775.68 → 6781.92] Well, yeah, but I just saw a still screenshot of the King Kong character, and I was like, yeah
[6782.96 → 6785.76] But like, uh, I don't really care that much
[6786.40 → 6790.00] Like it could just be stylized that way and maybe the gameplay is good, but
[6791.20 → 6792.32] no
[6792.56 → 6794.16] apparently not
[6796.48 → 6796.80] Yeah
[6797.44 → 6799.28] I'm just reading steam reviews right now
[6802.72 → 6804.08] I wonder what the positive ones are
[6804.08 → 6808.88] You know what game's a banger when it's called monkey.exe and has the stock unity image
[6812.72 → 6814.00] I don't know if I believe this
[6815.84 → 6816.72] I can't read it
[6816.72 → 6817.92] Harambe died for this
[6817.92 → 6821.84] Yeah
[6824.40 → 6825.12] Okay
[6825.12 → 6826.80] So all the positive ones just trolls then?
[6826.80 → 6830.16] Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. No, I don't think anyone legitimately liked the game
[6830.16 → 6830.88] I got it
[6832.88 → 6834.88] Okay, uh next topic
[6834.88 → 6836.88] AMD anti-lag ban update
[6837.12 → 6843.20] Uh, yeah last week there were widespread cases of players in multiple video games getting banned due to AMD's
[6843.20 → 6848.56] New feature anti-lag plus triggering their anti-cheat systems by devouring
[6849.28 → 6850.24] Sorry detouring
[6850.24 → 6852.00] Dyslexia is really fun sometimes
[6852.48 → 6854.72] By detouring engine dot DLL functions
[6855.52 → 6860.56] Um, this week AMD withdrew its latest radon driver promising to fix the issue
[6860.56 → 6865.68] Anti-lag plus is designed to reduce latency introduced by AMD's fluid motion frames feature
[6866.64 → 6868.64] What's more surprise discussion question
[6868.64 → 6873.68] What's more surprising that AMD didn't see this problem coming or that the massive rat's nest of inter
[6873.68 → 6877.68] Uh interacting drivers and software programs necessarily run modern games online works at all
[6878.72 → 6882.24] I think the second one all the modern world is stunning how it
[6882.88 → 6885.28] Tends to function. It's kind of wild. Um
[6885.92 → 6888.48] Not just tech but even just like shipping things
[6889.20 → 6893.60] Crazy, it's an it's amazing that you can just ship something, and it arrives somewhere at some point
[6894.24 → 6895.60] That's that's actually nutting like
[6896.48 → 6899.76] I don't know the fact that it's as reliable as it is
[6901.12 → 6903.44] I don't know kind of blows my mind sometimes
[6903.68 → 6908.56] Yeah, I um, I feel like people really do take these kinds of things for granted
[6908.56 → 6910.56] Did I send you that user comment?
[6911.20 → 6915.68] That someone posted on the secret shopper video that was basically like
[6916.72 → 6920.56] cringe imagine charging for shipping in 2023, and I was like
[6922.88 → 6928.72] Everyone is charging you for shipping. Yeah, it's just a matter of whether it's baked into the product cost or whether they are
[6929.36 → 6930.80] transparently
[6930.80 → 6935.60] Telling you how much of it is product cost and how much of it is shipping. That's the that's literally the only difference there is
[6936.32 → 6938.56] No free shipping is
[6939.20 → 6941.04] expense who
[6941.04 → 6945.36] Who do you think pays the person who walks to your door with the thing?
[6946.00 → 6947.60] What about all the other touchpoints?
[6948.16 → 6950.72] From when that was shipped, and it could have been a European?
[6950.72 → 6955.20] I did notice a lot of Europeans were outraged by the cost of shipping
[6955.76 → 6959.20] Okay, not everywhere has everybody like
[6960.72 → 6964.24] Smashed densely yeah like densely packed in together like in Europe
[6964.88 → 6966.88] um
[6966.88 → 6972.56] Gas have you been to a gas station and noticed that it's expensive?
[6973.12 → 6974.40] um
[6974.40 → 6979.12] Guess what when it goes on in a jet gas is even more expensive
[6980.16 → 6982.96] I don't actually I just don't even know what to say to stuff like that
[6983.20 → 6985.68] I like that jet gas not fuel just
[6986.24 → 6986.88] jet gas
[6986.88 → 6987.92] jet gas yeah
[6989.20 → 6990.24] You need some jet gas
[6992.32 → 6994.64] Got some right here sounds like a fallout drug
[6994.72 → 6998.00] I understand jet is already a fallout drug but jet gas sounds like
[6998.00 → 7001.36] A new one like a worse one like the side effect
[7008.00 → 7009.44] That's better than the joke I was going to make
[7011.36 → 7012.00] Oh man
[7013.44 → 7014.24] Uh
[7014.24 → 7015.44] who
[7015.44 → 7019.84] Oh, this sucks. Honestly, you get this news article every once in a while
[7020.88 → 7023.12] Repair techs found snooping personal photos
[7023.44 → 7027.84] CBC's marketplace took various devices to 20 repair stores across Ontario
[7028.56 → 7034.32] Including both small independent shops and large chains after installing monitoring software on their devices
[7034.72 → 7043.68] technicians for at least nine of those stores access private data unrelated to the repair such as photos and social media apps
[7045.36 → 7050.16] At least one not only viewed the photos but copied them onto an USB key
[7052.00 → 7052.88] The expose
[7054.08 → 7054.48] Expose
[7055.52 → 7055.76] Yeah
[7055.76 → 7063.84] Is it supposed to have two e's? No. Okay. Thanks. The expose was a follow-up to a study published earlier this year that found that
[7063.84 → 7070.72] many electronics repair service providers lack privacy policies or controls to safeguard personal data from snooping and theft
[7071.52 → 7075.36] The main disappointing thing here in my opinion is that it was nine out of 20
[7076.00 → 7079.20] Where are you supposed to go? That's crazy
[7079.20 → 7081.20] Where are you supposed to go Luke?
[7081.20 → 7085.20] Well best geek squad does this thing where the monitors are facing
[7085.92 → 7091.20] Out but then a very significant amount of the work these days as far as my understanding goes
[7091.20 → 7095.20] I haven't worked there since they did this system. It might not work the way that I think a little disclaimer
[7095.68 → 7098.24] as far as my understanding goes a significant amount of the work is
[7098.72 → 7099.12] uh
[7099.12 → 7101.04] remoted out
[7101.04 → 7102.32] Right
[7102.32 → 7105.52] So you have no way if it's not occurring in the store then
[7106.56 → 7108.48] Yeah, all bets are off basically. Yeah
[7109.28 → 7110.40] And surveillance footage
[7110.40 → 7114.32] Maybe they have surveillance footage of the monitors that the like texts are accessing
[7114.32 → 7118.88] But that's only as good as someone's willingness to have you ever actually scrubbed through hours of surveillance footage
[7119.60 → 7121.20] like it
[7121.20 → 7122.40] Yeah, you could
[7122.40 → 7125.52] Quickly open up a folder and copy no one's going to find that in the surveillance footage
[7126.00 → 7127.04] Yeah, yeah
[7127.68 → 7130.40] Don't get any ideas Dan and like I I I've
[7130.96 → 7134.96] I've worked in one of these shops before I've been literally asked as part of the task
[7135.60 → 7137.12] to access someone's photos before
[7138.24 → 7138.96] but clearly
[7140.00 → 7140.88] Like to back them up?
[7140.88 → 7141.04] They wouldn't have done
[7142.08 → 7145.68] uh to make sure it worked in some program or whatever like there's
[7146.16 → 7150.40] I've also usually I this is when I was like a teenager. I already knew it was a problem
[7150.40 → 7153.20] I would ask to do that portion when they were there
[7153.92 → 7156.32] Right, yeah, and I would just do it in front of the yeah
[7156.32 → 7159.52] The spot that I was at had a like swivel monitor sure
[7159.68 → 7162.56] So I could make sure that we could both see the monitor, and then I would do the thing
[7163.04 → 7168.48] Um, there's also a lot of unintentional access that happens that this isn't talking about
[7168.80 → 7173.92] But it's pretty common for people to set their um, their screensaver
[7174.48 → 7178.48] I don't know if this is still coming to a slideshow of they're my pictures' folder
[7178.48 → 7182.32] And then their computers just not working, and they forget that that's a thing
[7183.20 → 7186.16] And then they bring it in you fix their computer, and then it's just sitting there
[7186.16 → 7187.92] And a porn or whatever or just them
[7189.04 → 7189.28] Right
[7190.16 → 7194.88] Happened multiple times. Yeah, you've probably seen some stuff, and you have those monitors facing out to the store
[7195.52 → 7197.52] And it's a whole thing
[7201.60 → 7202.24] I don't know
[7203.12 → 7208.00] Yeah, okay, so what you're trying to say is on the one hand gross condemn this
[7208.00 → 7210.00] But on the other hand
[7210.00 → 7210.32] guys
[7213.04 → 7215.20] Some basic digital hygiene yeah
[7216.32 → 7218.08] Please yeah, okay cool. Yeah
[7222.08 → 7226.24] Yeah, yeah, vinegar and float plane chat says I worked in support for several years
[7226.96 → 7229.36] And exactly zero times out of however many
[7229.92 → 7235.44] Was anyone paying attention to what data I accessed? Oh, no, I had very good
[7235.44 → 7237.44] I
[7237.44 → 7240.48] Remember three managers that I had when I worked in geek squad
[7241.04 → 7241.36] Um
[7242.24 → 7248.00] Each one of them was honestly very good. It was not this is years ago. It might have changed many years ago
[7248.32 → 7254.00] I don't remember there being any policies or anything like that that was actually handed down from like corporate
[7254.64 → 7255.28] Really?
[7255.28 → 7257.28] But the managers
[7257.28 → 7259.28] Which were just like
[7260.00 → 7262.80] Older but still teenage dudes for the most part
[7263.28 → 7264.32] um
[7264.32 → 7269.12] Would talk about these types of things and like just basically like don't be a
[7269.68 → 7271.68] whole type of policies, right?
[7271.76 → 7273.04] Um
[7273.04 → 7277.44] Like bill and Ted style only work on things in the back room that are hardware issues
[7277.44 → 7281.76] Because then you're not accessing data in the back room that I don't I
[7282.56 → 7284.48] very strongly believe this was not a
[7285.04 → 7290.88] Corporate policy at the time, but every manager that I had at that time this was a policy only work on hardware issues in the
[7290.88 → 7296.40] Backroom if it's a software issue in the front area blah blah blah blah all this other type of stuff don't mess around
[7297.44 → 7298.48] Yeah, it
[7299.20 → 7300.56] I felt like we were operating. Well
[7301.60 → 7307.04] I'll say that much and I'm sure I am 100 certain that there are repair shops with high integrity, but it
[7307.04 → 7310.56] I'm very disappointed that nine out of 20 failed this that's really brutal
[7313.36 → 7316.24] All right, we've got a couple more topics that I do want to hit today
[7317.52 → 7321.04] Um, let me see if I can find them. Oh
[7322.80 → 7324.80] What is that noise Dan?
[7324.80 → 7326.16] Do you have any idea what that is?
[7326.16 → 7333.76] Yeah, that's the uh ac condenser pump pulling all the water out of it. Oh, I forgot to turn the ac back on you guys cold
[7334.24 → 7335.60] um
[7335.60 → 7338.40] No, your sweaters kind of chilling. I'm good. Uh
[7339.12 → 7341.12] Mountain Dew Ltd screwdriver
[7343.04 → 7345.04] Uh
[7345.04 → 7346.64] Reddit user ox
[7346.96 → 7348.56] Empress
[7348.56 → 7350.56] Has made a screwdriver
[7351.12 → 7353.92] Based on the shape of the Ltd one out. Oh
[7355.04 → 7356.24] I see
[7356.24 → 7358.24] I am now holding it
[7358.88 → 7360.88] That was quick
[7360.88 → 7361.84] Uh-huh
[7362.64 → 7366.56] Okay, well, I guess I don't need to I guess I don't need to show the picture anymore
[7367.28 → 7368.24] This is pretty cool
[7369.12 → 7372.56] Offered us a Ltd styled screwdriver
[7373.12 → 7375.36] made out of Mountain Dew bottles
[7376.08 → 7381.28] Using a DIY filament maker in return for an official version
[7381.92 → 7383.12] We have
[7383.12 → 7385.20] Accepted this offer
[7385.20 → 7389.36] Uh, and uh, our discussion question is what do you think of the dew driver?
[7390.32 → 7394.48] I didn't know you could make DIY filament. That is so cool.
[7394.48 → 7399.76] I didn't either and that just makes me believe that that whole 3d printer band is going to work
[7399.76 → 7402.64] Even less than they hoped two litter bottle you get out
[7402.64 → 7406.96] You stick it on a nail you put a little blade thing, and you can cut it into strips, and it makes 3d
[7406.96 → 7408.96] I'm just surprised this
[7410.96 → 7414.32] Is it specific enough does it have to go through more of a process than that?
[7414.32 → 7416.72] Yeah, you got to kind of do an extrude thing, but it's like
[7417.68 → 7423.76] Actually really workable. It's very similar types of plastic. That is so cool. That's amazing
[7423.76 → 7430.32] You can kind of see there's some discolouration around in the middle because it's not like absolutely pristine and pure. Yeah, but like
[7431.04 → 7435.92] That is a hundred percent recycled. It's an it's an it's an it's a screwdriver hand
[7435.92 → 7439.36] Honestly, the colour shifting just makes it kind of like look it looks better
[7439.52 → 7444.56] And you can mix and match like if you want to feed some it's like the uniqueness of a wood grain or something like that
[7444.64 → 7447.84] Like it's just cool. I don't mind that at all exactly if anything. That's a feature
[7448.72 → 7452.64] That is so cool. Uh, okay. Well, hey enjoy your screwdriver
[7453.20 → 7457.20] And I'll also be enjoying mine. Thank you very kindly
[7457.68 → 7461.36] Tynan says I like the concept of recycled bottle filament. It works so well
[7462.00 → 7464.40] You remelt it. Oh, no re-soften it
[7464.40 → 7471.76] Most of them are pet normally pet is used for lots of filaments, but pet works on its own
[7472.88 → 7476.08] Very cool. Wow. Can I feel it? Yeah. Yeah, for sure
[7478.00 → 7482.00] What's so light it's speaking of dude, can I feel it?
[7483.68 → 7489.44] Okay, the next AMD ultimate tech upgrade yeah might be the best one yet. Oh
[7489.44 → 7496.64] Not because it's you know, uh, you know popular personality over here that you guys know very well or anything like that
[7497.20 → 7498.88] Do you know who it is?
[7498.96 → 7500.64] Well, is it the guy that got a concussion?
[7501.20 → 7502.16] No. Oh
[7503.52 → 7504.16] He was helping
[7504.72 → 7506.16] Is it on flow plane right now? No
[7507.60 → 7509.36] Well, I've why no I don't know that
[7509.36 → 7510.16] What's that?
[7510.16 → 7512.16] Ariana from HR. Oh, nice
[7512.96 → 7514.80] We went out of our way to make sure
[7515.92 → 7517.92] That I was not written up
[7518.72 → 7520.72] Throughout the entire process
[7521.52 → 7526.80] That is going to be incredible. What does that mean? Oh my god. Do they just like to tape his mouth shut?
[7529.04 → 7531.04] Probably should have
[7531.60 → 7533.60] That sounds like a salt. Did you end up?
[7534.40 → 7540.16] No, we asked him to do it himself. Does that work? I don't know. It's coercion. Oh, darn it. Yeah, it's uh, it's its gonna
[7540.16 → 7542.08] Be a good one. It's going to be a good one
[7542.16 → 7548.48] It's going to be it's going to be worth the wait. Actually, I think it's not the next one coming to the channel. The next one coming to the channel is
[7549.12 → 7550.80] the um
[7550.80 → 7556.16] The customer care supervisor for lttstore.coma dam. So that one's on flow plane. Is that one on flow plane? Yeah. Okay
[7556.16 → 7561.68] So yeah, no the next one is going to be weeks away because it's shot we shot it on
[7562.56 → 7564.16] Wednesday, I believe this week
[7564.64 → 7569.76] So it'll take a couple of weeks in editing and need brand approval and blah blah blah blah blah and sort of tedious stuff
[7570.00 → 7575.20] But it's shot. It's going to be amazing. Look forward to it. I also suspect that there will be
[7577.44 → 7581.12] Oh, no some bloopers on float plane. It's on that. Oh
[7582.40 → 7586.08] It's available to the ECC squad. I didn't know if we were saying that publicly
[7586.16 → 7591.52] Or not yeah, we've talked about the ECC squad. Yeah, so it's its it's and it's an ECC squad territory, right?
[7591.60 → 7597.28] Yeah, so they get earlier access to videos, and they tell us if they notice anything that's wrong with it
[7597.28 → 7599.28] we talked about this after the
[7599.52 → 7604.08] After the production break. Yeah, no ECC squad's not secret at all. Yeah, yeah
[7605.68 → 7607.92] ECC is error correction and checking
[7610.80 → 7614.56] It is a reference to ram obviously, but the acronym still works. Yeah, totally does
[7614.56 → 7619.04] All right, uh, I think there's like one more yeah valve
[7619.60 → 7622.08] gives a peek into its recommendation algorithm
[7622.40 → 7632.16] They released a video presentation last week explaining steam's recommendation system, which is a mix of algorithmic visibility and curated featuring with the former being
[7632.16 → 7633.36] personalized
[7633.36 → 7639.28] So featured recommended discovery queue curator recommendations and the latter shown to everyone like special offers
[7639.28 → 7642.96] These special offers are primarily decided on the basis of revenue
[7643.52 → 7646.80] Quote when a bunch of players are spending time and money on your game
[7647.04 → 7650.96] It's a really strong signal to steam that it could be interesting to other players too
[7651.44 → 7657.92] If you're looking to be part of a midweek or weekend deal, you're going to need to be in the top few hundred best-selling games on all steam
[7658.72 → 7663.36] According to the presentation steam's algorithm does not favour recent over old titles
[7664.08 → 7673.84] Could have guessed that yeah doesn't highly weigh store page traffic and only down ways negatively reviewed games if they are below 40 percent positive
[7674.88 → 7681.76] That's interesting. So you have to have a really negative bad game for it to affect its algorithmic positioning
[7682.40 → 7686.48] Wishlists do affect the popular upcoming section prior to a game's release
[7686.48 → 7691.36] But early access releases don't drive visibility on an algorithmic level
[7691.84 → 7698.56] According to valves business team steam doesn't sell ad space on its storefront because they don't think the platform should be pay to win
[7699.44 → 7707.92] And that steam's level playing field and recommendation system leads to surprise hits emerging organically such as pseudo regalia and Dave the diver
[7707.92 → 7710.56] This is really cool. We talked a way
[7710.56 → 7714.08] The platform shouldn't be pay to win, but if people spend money in your game is algorithmic
[7714.08 → 7718.00] It's not really wins. Yeah, well, I want you to spend money in the game, but that's not
[7719.04 → 7720.64] options that
[7720.64 → 7722.64] positively influence steam
[7723.04 → 7731.92] I get what you're saying, but they mean the platform exposure itself is not pay to win and unless you build systems into your game that positively
[7733.52 → 7739.12] Sure, but I am okay. Okay. Okay. I think you're I think you're kind of being like that about it a little bit. Yeah, okay good
[7739.12 → 7741.12] um
[7741.12 → 7744.88] But what's interesting about this is we talked a few months ago about the general and
[7745.28 → 7751.52] Of the internet steam has definitely resisted this they have resisted 100% give them that resisted
[7751.84 → 7756.72] Uh, they have definitely participated in some of these some of it some of this, you know
[7756.96 → 7761.52] getting past your customer first mindset into a profits first mindset, but
[7761.52 → 7763.52] But
[7763.76 → 7766.96] But it could be so much worse this not philosophy
[7767.84 → 7769.84] I hope it survives
[7769.92 → 7770.80] Because
[7770.80 → 7776.16] Amazon is such a great example of this used to be great to shop on it's
[7777.04 → 7778.08] atrocious it is
[7779.20 → 7781.20] I don't browse at all
[7781.52 → 7785.68] I used to my I don't at all even when I want to shop on Amazon
[7786.16 → 7787.12] It's not worth it
[7787.12 → 7793.04] Like we've done streams in the past on Prime Day for example where we are actively looking for deals and
[7793.44 → 7796.80] They are there in a lot of cases, but they're so hard to find
[7797.12 → 7800.72] That's why you need someone doing a Prime Day stream to show you where anything good is
[7801.20 → 7805.68] Yeah, I used to I, so I don't like buying from Amazon because I don't like Amazon
[7806.56 → 7808.56] but I used to
[7808.96 → 7813.04] Shop on Amazon and then try to find if I could find that thing somewhere else
[7813.04 → 7817.92] Because shopping on Amazon was just so much of a better experience. Um, and that's just not true anymore
[7817.92 → 7822.72] Yeah, dr. Gizmo and uh twitch chat says they don't need ads. They get revenue from game sales. Yeah
[7823.28 → 7825.28] Amazon gets revenue from selling the product
[7826.00 → 7831.12] But they charge for ads anyway because they're at this point where all they care about is shareholder returns now
[7831.60 → 7835.12] Whereas in the early stage all they cared about was customer acquisition
[7835.44 → 7839.04] Yeah, and it's its this great article that I forget where it is
[7839.04 → 7843.28] but it basically talks about the and vacation of everything um and
[7844.40 → 7847.52] Lays out in really easy to understand terms
[7848.72 → 7856.00] How this life cycle why this life cycle what this life cycle is of especially internet brands and maybe part of the reason?
[7856.00 → 7860.00] It's so focused on internet brands is because we see this evolution
[7860.24 → 7863.36] Happening so fast from a focus on the customer to
[7864.16 → 7867.76] I forget what the three stages are it's like customer employees and then shareholders or
[7868.64 → 7874.56] Something I can't, I can't remember, but it's if oh, yeah customers then partners shareholders
[7875.20 → 7882.48] Uh, so first Amazon was all about customers, and it was all about just the best possible experience to the customers that screw you partners and
[7882.96 → 7886.64] And shareholders you you you make no money, and you know, whatever
[7886.88 → 7890.00] And then it was all about partnerships you grow grow grow grow grow grow
[7890.00 → 7896.64] We've got a customer base that you want to access let's get huge, and then you're huge, and you go okay time to make money
[7896.64 → 7898.64] Now turn on all the money spigots
[7899.12 → 7901.12] It's its a perfect article
[7902.24 → 7904.24] Yeah, all right
[7905.44 → 7911.36] Is it time for Sancho after dark I think it's time there's new thread rippers coming next month, which is really inconvenient for me
[7911.36 → 7913.36] We already shot compensator for
[7914.16 → 7916.00] And they weren't out yet
[7916.00 → 7922.16] I guess as long as we release the video before they launch them. We should be okay. That could be part of the point of compensator
[7923.20 → 7928.56] Well, no because I specifically talk about thread ripper and how AMD and intel have both abandoned the HD
[7928.56 → 7931.20] HEAT market, so we're going to have to shoot a pickup or something
[7934.80 → 7936.80] Um
[7936.80 → 7938.80] We're releasing in November
[7938.80 → 7944.88] According to pc Meg who dell gave remote access to test a 96 core thread ripper pro 99
[7945.28 → 7951.20] That's 995 we that can't be the right model numbers gotta be something else. Oh, 79 95 we
[7952.64 → 7957.52] That's weird. This generation is a serious upgrade over the 5000 series
[7957.52 → 7964.00] It's zen 4 has a TDP of 350 watts and is PCIE gen 5
[7965.12 → 7967.12] wow
[7967.12 → 7975.60] Oh, this is thread ripper pro that's available with 96 core AMD is also resurrecting consumer thread ripper which has up to 64 cores and starts at
[7975.60 → 7979.52] 1500 okay, that's barely consumer man AMD has completely
[7980.96 → 7983.04] abandoned any semblance of
[7983.04 → 7991.20] Wanting to be like a scrappy, you know take care of actual gamers were affordable kind of player in the market
[7992.00 → 7995.12] Starting at 1500 what did first gen thread ripper start at?
[7995.52 → 7997.36] uh thread ripper
[7997.36 → 8000.56] What is 1900x? I believe was the entry-level one
[8002.96 → 8004.96] It was 550 bucks
[8005.68 → 8008.08] It was only eight cores mind you but like
[8009.28 → 8012.24] the 1920 which was uh
[8013.20 → 8014.72] Hold on 12
[8016.08 → 8022.16] I want to say 12 core 10 course 10 course I think it was 10 course crap. I don't remember. Furthermore, I think it's 10 course
[8025.84 → 8028.00] No 12 course okay
[8029.92 → 8030.48] All back
[8031.28 → 8034.16] Was 800 bucks like come on you guys
[8034.96 → 8036.96] This sucks
[8037.04 → 8038.56] Yeah, there that's all I have to say about that
[8038.56 → 8042.48] It's after dark time
[8045.36 → 8046.48] Time to get dark
[8047.52 → 8048.40] Dan's working on it
[8049.04 → 8049.68] He's got this
[8050.24 → 8052.72] You're not even going to be able to see me anymore in my black hoodie
[8053.52 → 8056.24] Wow, it's not black. It's like uh, like uh
[8057.20 → 8060.72] Like a washed black. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool. I like this one
[8061.68 → 8064.72] If Nick is the one that brought these over I'm not surprised to give me this one
[8066.40 → 8066.64] Yeah
[8067.68 → 8068.40] ATTU
[8069.28 → 8070.64] All right, Dan hit me
[8070.64 → 8075.20] I have to get settled
[8075.20 → 8079.20] Uh, where are my merch messages? There they are
[8080.48 → 8080.80] Okay
[8080.80 → 8088.40] Part of the reason I love the wan show for direct access it gives to the head of the company
[8088.96 → 8093.84] And uh, how transparent you are there any other companies that you would like that level of access to?
[8094.40 → 8094.96] Oh, man
[8096.80 → 8097.92] All of them
[8097.92 → 8099.44] I think it would be chaos though
[8100.16 → 8100.64] Oh, yeah
[8100.64 → 8104.80] Like it would actually be a problem if every company just talked about like everything that's going on
[8104.80 → 8105.44] That'd be sweet
[8106.08 → 8107.52] Because people bring the chaos
[8107.76 → 8111.12] Yeah, no, I think people would misunderstand it a lot. I think it would actually be bad
[8111.36 → 8112.48] Yeah, but if everybody was doing it
[8113.68 → 8115.84] Hey, look everybody's doing it
[8115.84 → 8117.84] Are you saying it would be misused?
[8117.84 → 8118.80] I'm saying that
[8118.80 → 8119.76] Company lies
[8121.04 → 8121.84] Linus
[8124.24 → 8125.20] It's all a farce
[8125.20 → 8126.16] Oh my goodness
[8127.92 → 8129.92] Or what's it? Yeah, what's your what's your point here, sir?
[8129.92 → 8135.44] My point is that okay? Okay, let's say valve was totally transparent about everything that they're working on
[8135.68 → 8136.00] Sure
[8136.00 → 8140.56] I think it would actually lead to a lot of negativity towards valve when projects don't pan out
[8140.56 → 8143.04] So I completely agree. This is my star citizen argument
[8143.68 → 8147.04] Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So we're in agreement then
[8147.44 → 8151.36] I would still like yeah, very good. Very good. Okay. Good. I would still like it
[8152.56 → 8154.88] But yeah, people would treat it negatively for sure
[8154.88 → 8157.68] Because no one understands
[8159.12 → 8160.00] Timelines
[8160.00 → 8165.12] And the rough nature of them when it comes to actually like
[8166.32 → 8168.56] Crafting something that takes a long time to make
[8169.84 → 8172.72] If is you're like hey, this should take me a day
[8173.76 → 8176.16] Yeah, I regret announcing the screwdriver so early. Yeah
[8176.16 → 8181.68] And you never know what's going to happen. Maybe the person working on it
[8182.80 → 8189.12] Uh quits or gets long-term sick or something like that happens like that's gonna very substantially impact
[8190.00 → 8192.56] The release time of this thing maybe
[8193.20 → 8199.12] Something else comes up that you absolutely should work on it is significantly better for your company to do
[8199.84 → 8202.80] But now because you've publicly said you're making this other thing now
[8203.04 → 8206.24] You're gonna significantly disappoint people that were excited about that thing
[8207.28 → 8209.84] When if you just didn't say anything in the first place
[8210.88 → 8214.80] No, one's going to have anything to be disappointed about you get to make the thing that you should have made anyway
[8215.52 → 8217.36] And maybe you can come back to it at another date
[8218.24 → 8220.24] But yeah, I don't know
[8221.36 → 8225.52] The like hyper aggressive nature that a lot of people
[8225.52 → 8230.64] Treat certain companies and representatives with on the internet
[8232.16 → 8238.96] Can be really detrimental sometimes in ways that people don't seem to understand this is the argument that I've brought up for a million years
[8238.96 → 8243.92] About the blizzard developers at blazon and there's a blazon coming up. I think soon
[8244.88 → 8250.16] So it's going to be relevant again. I'm sure because they'll say something dumb again. Furthermore, I'm sure it's like every time
[8250.16 → 8251.60] um
[8252.16 → 8256.00] But they blizzard keeps putting developers on stage at blazon
[8257.28 → 8260.40] And then they say something silly and then more stuff
[8261.36 → 8264.80] Comes in place to stop that from happening like they used to take um
[8266.24 → 8270.80] Attendee questions, I don't think they do anymore. I think what they do now is
[8271.68 → 8274.88] I don't remember and this could be wrong. I don't know. This isn't a topic
[8274.88 → 8280.72] um, but I think what they do now is they take attendee questions, and then they write them down on cards, and they have a
[8281.60 → 8283.36] a blazon person
[8284.24 → 8289.44] Read the questions out instead of the attendee so they can control the questions. So you can't tell them. Oh, I'm going to ask
[8291.12 → 8293.68] Something cool, and then you ask them something brutal
[8294.40 → 8297.20] um, so like you're you're slowly getting away from that
[8297.76 → 8300.96] um, you put developers up on stage that that say like
[8301.76 → 8303.84] um, you think you do, but you don't or
[8304.56 → 8309.60] Uh, what you have what do you not have phoned that kind of stuff? They'll say some like stupid stuff like that
[8310.40 → 8315.20] And then you know, they're gonna start disappearing from stages. You're not going to have access to them. That kind of stuff happens
[8315.20 → 8318.16] And I yeah, I don't know it concerns me a little bit
[8319.44 → 8321.44] All right, here's us Dan
[8321.84 → 8323.28] Luke what's up?
[8323.28 → 8329.28] Aspects of Linus have changed over the years, and why are or aren't you okay with those changes?
[8329.28 → 8333.84] Linus said that you told him he had changed in what is it like to work for Linus video?
[8334.64 → 8339.84] He's changed. I've changed. We've all changed. It's part of life. Um, you're not supposed to let line how tactful
[8342.32 → 8344.32] I think he's changed
[8344.32 → 8354.80] I'm just straight up not going to talk about all of this
[8355.84 → 8357.84] um, I'll talk about some of it though
[8360.40 → 8362.40] um
[8363.28 → 8365.28] I think he's changed
[8366.32 → 8369.44] In less ways than the audience thinks
[8371.20 → 8374.48] And in more ways than the audience thinks at the same time
[8375.76 → 8380.08] Like a lot of the things that people are like he changed it's like actually no
[8380.88 → 8386.00] But then there are things that like they they they don't point out that are like yeah, you've totally changed
[8386.80 → 8388.80] Which I find very intriguing?
[8389.36 → 8392.40] Like there are things that I know frustrate you and they frustrate me as well
[8392.40 → 8397.92] We're like you can't talk about the price of things anymore. Oh, yeah, because no matter what you say
[8399.20 → 8402.24] There's an angle on why you're a bad person because oh, yeah
[8402.96 → 8406.48] Oh, yeah, um, yeah, they have we talked about that on the show before? I don't know
[8407.20 → 8409.28] I've just been noticing this pattern if I
[8410.40 → 8414.96] It's a very real pattern if I say something is expensive
[8415.76 → 8420.24] Because it's not expensive to you. Yeah, and if I say something is
[8421.60 → 8423.60] A good value, it's only cheap to you
[8425.04 → 8426.56] Okay
[8426.56 → 8429.28] So we've gotten to the point now where in
[8430.08 → 8436.08] Writing in script reviews. I will, I'll tell the writers like look we can't, I can't, I can't have an opinion on a price
[8437.36 → 8439.36] I can speak objectively
[8439.84 → 8441.84] relative to
[8441.84 → 8442.64] um
[8442.64 → 8447.52] The non-slim PlayStation 5 the new one is the same price
[8448.16 → 8448.56] um
[8448.56 → 8450.56] and
[8450.56 → 8452.56] It's clear that Sony is
[8452.64 → 8456.96] Increasing the price of the all digital version without increasing it by having it be more
[8456.96 → 8462.48] And then also it costs more to upgrade that one to the disc one with the new modular thing
[8462.48 → 8465.36] If you get it after the fact or whatever it was that we kind of discussed last week
[8465.36 → 8466.64] I don't remember the exact details
[8467.28 → 8469.28] but if I were to just say
[8469.28 → 8469.76] um
[8471.04 → 8472.16] Yeah, that
[8472.16 → 8474.08] drive upgrade is cheap
[8474.08 → 8475.44] Because you know what?
[8475.44 → 8479.28] I think for a first-party accessory for a console that has the kind of utility
[8479.84 → 8486.16] That a Blu-ray drive does and giving the kind of flexibility that it does to buyers to get something
[8486.72 → 8490.72] At a lower price today, but also be able to add that functionality later
[8490.72 → 8492.72] I think it's I think it's very reasonable
[8492.96 → 8499.20] But there's always going to be a way to twist that around or if I say hey Facebook marketplace is full
[8499.84 → 8501.84] Of cheap GPUs right now
[8501.92 → 8502.96] um
[8502.96 → 8506.48] It doesn't matter what the context is for that statement, right?
[8506.48 → 8511.28] Um, it doesn't matter that I'm talking about it in terms of you know relative to what you can get
[8511.76 → 8517.36] uh brand new in a retail store or relative to what we were looking at six months ago a year ago
[8517.84 → 8520.00] for GPU pricing um
[8520.00 → 8520.56] it
[8520.56 → 8523.12] It just seems to get twisted around on me, and it's uh
[8524.00 → 8526.96] I don't really get it. I get it or I do get it. I have
[8527.92 → 8534.24] Money now. I don't worry about buying a GPU. That is not uh, that's not a concern in my life
[8534.88 → 8538.80] Um, and I know that for a lot of people it is so hearing me even
[8539.28 → 8546.96] Comment on it is it makes people angry like actually angry. That's the thing that you guys got to understand is these are not just
[8547.68 → 8548.96] um
[8548.96 → 8553.28] You know well articulated uh thoughtful comments about how
[8554.08 → 8554.80] um
[8554.80 → 8561.92] You know, it could be that over the course of a successful career you inherently reach a point where your relatability is reduced
[8562.56 → 8567.52] Because of your life situation not being the same as the people you're talking to anymore like that's not what I'm talking about
[8567.52 → 8569.28] I'm talking people are
[8569.28 → 8573.68] Mad like furious about it. It's its I'm taken aback by it because
[8574.40 → 8575.36] as
[8575.36 → 8583.04] As much as, as much as my life situation has changed a lot actually a lot of my attitudes towards money and spending it particularly personally
[8583.12 → 8584.08] Haven't
[8584.08 → 8589.36] I've definitely allowed myself to loosen up a bit obviously the car was a huge example of that
[8589.60 → 8594.56] But I still wouldn't even begin to consider spending seven dollars on a beverage
[8595.20 → 8596.24] um
[8596.24 → 8598.32] And that's you know what I can
[8598.32 → 8598.96] I'm
[8598.96 → 8599.76] I'm
[8599.76 → 8600.32] I'm
[8600.32 → 8602.40] And this is going to get turned around on me
[8602.40 → 8604.48] I'm sure, but seven dollars mean nothing to me
[8604.48 → 8606.08] Absolutely, nothing
[8606.64 → 8611.04] I could spend seven dollars on a beverage every day for the rest of my life. I wouldn't notice it
[8611.04 → 8612.88] But that's not
[8614.00 → 8616.16] My approach that's not my habit. That's not
[8616.72 → 8619.12] Uh, that's not how I feel about it. That's not how I was raised
[8619.12 → 8626.62] that's not how I lived most of my adult life even and I just I don't foresee it
[8626.62 → 8631.48] changing anytime soon like to me when I see anyone who isn't a high net worth
[8631.48 → 8639.36] individual spending that kind of money on a drink I am floored, and you know what
[8639.36 → 8643.72] I get it people get enjoyment in different ways that just is I couldn't
[8643.72 → 8650.26] pot I just couldn't possibly enjoy it every sip is like nickel like I
[8650.26 → 8656.14] can't I can't lose it I can't, I can't lose that um and so there's like there's I
[8656.14 → 8660.76] yeah, and sometimes I think I that I'm contradictory right because I don't
[8660.76 → 8664.48] I'm not acting that I actually I feel that I have a heart I drink water
[8664.48 → 8671.22] because especially here it's its it's its plentiful it's free basically it's
[8671.22 → 8676.50] and it's, and it's good yeah some places in the world it's yeah yeah totally
[8676.50 → 8679.94] different situation right but then on the other hand I have this like stupid
[8679.94 → 8689.98] midlife crisis mobile car I don't know I'm not going to go so into everything because I
[8689.98 → 8694.28] think every single one of them is going to have that type of response, but I think a
[8694.28 → 8700.62] lot of the ways that the audience thinks Linus has changed are inaccurate
[8700.62 → 8711.90] yeah I don't know, and I think a lot of it is very natural aging things it's got to do
[8711.90 → 8716.24] my I have to do my thing yeah gotta do my thing I don't think it's a big deal I
[8716.24 → 8723.44] don't think he's changed in if is you had changed in ways that I thought were
[8723.44 → 8730.34] like terrible I just wouldn't be here yeah I know that so like checks and
[8730.34 → 8734.36] balances baby I would like to think I have also changed I think I have in
[8734.36 → 8738.16] actually a bunch of ways oh definitely I've probably changed more than you no
[8738.16 → 8747.10] um maybe in ways that are visible to you probably that's fair enough I was super
[8747.10 → 8752.62] immature when we started this dearie yeah in ways that probably weren't obvious
[8752.62 → 8758.80] to you at the time because you were younger and in a very different place in
[8758.80 → 8764.90] your career and so my deficiencies at that time were probably less obvious to
[8764.90 → 8770.52] you oh no I can see them but so this is part of another thing I was going to say
[8770.52 → 8773.68] which I'm going to bundle a bunch of stuff into one by saying that you're a bit
[8773.68 → 8778.74] softer now I don't actually mean that that that saying that to a dude is often
[8778.74 → 8784.14] going to be interpreted as bad oh I don't take I don't mean in that way oh I mean
[8784.14 → 8790.82] there's like a more consideration I take my time more yeah yeah I I I
[8790.82 → 8795.08] Linus's brain has always been fast action fire book book book go go go
[8795.08 → 8801.02] and over the last few years especially I think yeah and I do not mean in the last
[8801.02 → 8805.74] few months I specifically mean in the last few years don't get me twisted a
[8805.74 → 8810.98] little bit more time intentional slowdown I moved fast and broke a lot of stuff
[8810.98 → 8815.76] yeah which is fun and good sometimes yeah it can be good yeah and then
[8815.76 → 8823.08] eventually you run into you realize that breaking things takes more time than
[8823.08 → 8827.54] just planning and doing them right in the first place there's this quote that I'm
[8827.54 → 8831.24] going to misquote brutally I don't know exactly how it goes, but it's like haste
[8831.24 → 8835.80] now is time waste later oh sure, and it's the concept of like if you're
[8835.80 → 8841.26] rooting through like a trunk for things and moving things out of the way is taking
[8841.26 → 8843.86] too long so you just start throwing them all over the place you're going to have to
[8843.86 → 8846.96] clean that up later that's gonna waste a lot of time sometimes it's going to be
[8846.96 → 8850.60] applicable yeah sometimes you need to just fire through it yeah or better yet if
[8850.60 → 8855.26] you put them in an organized fashion like the farther back you go yeah
[8855.26 → 8861.32] yeah and plan things more carefully the more compounded savings you can realize
[8861.32 → 8867.58] yeah yeah I don't know, so there's stuff like that but I genuinely think a lot
[8867.58 → 8872.30] of the ways that the audience points out the change yeah is usually inaccurate I
[8872.30 → 8877.64] think it's a lot of projection yeahs no offence often that to a lot, but I see
[8877.64 → 8883.14] constant comments about how you've changed or about how LTT's changed or
[8883.14 → 8888.54] something, and I'm just like not only is this wrong, but it oftentimes is very
[8888.54 → 8893.38] provably wrong yeah it's just like object like I can't man I don't know what
[8893.38 → 8897.18] comments about the videos getting better after you hired a new CEO were
[8897.18 → 8903.48] hilarious yeah like ah and that kind of stuff is not isolated to that incident
[8903.48 → 8909.24] that is just the most blatantly obviously provably incorrect ones well there have
[8909.24 → 8912.64] been all kinds of ones like there was a period a few years ago I think it was
[8912.64 → 8916.54] now where there was just this kind of momentum in the community complaining
[8916.54 → 8922.88] about like the immature like dick jokes and stuff like that, and you know forever
[8922.88 → 8927.94] and just for fun I've replied to a handful of them linking them to videos
[8927.94 → 8932.50] from the first month that the channel existed that were full of like there
[8932.50 → 8936.52] were complaints about the campy humour and the immature jokes, and so I just like I
[8936.52 → 8942.04] just sent them I was like look this has always been this yeah maybe you don't
[8942.04 → 8944.94] like them anymore, and you don't work maybe you grow up, and you know what
[8944.94 → 8949.72] that's fine, but you know understand a couple of things one is you obviously
[8949.72 → 8957.34] did at some point and two we do not actually think the number 69 is funny the
[8957.34 → 8964.28] thing that's funny is that it's not funny it's just it's cringe it's its awful
[8964.28 → 8968.92] it's like that that's what she said constant refrain from Michael Scott on the
[8968.92 → 8973.32] office like the lowest possible brow yeah we're we are leaning into it
[8973.32 → 8979.44] going haha number like it's there's nothing it's there's nothing funny about
[8979.44 → 8984.70] it, and it's just we're just me man we're just me man it's okay or no it's not or
[8984.70 → 8988.42] it's not, and you like don't have to watch, but I promise you it was always
[8988.42 → 8993.68] there always here and like the cheap thing to back that up a little bit we both
[8993.68 → 8999.32] grew up without a ton of money yeah I am notoriously called cheap yes, and I've
[8999.32 → 9005.46] said this I've said this before and by everybody else I've said this before and
[9005.46 → 9011.92] people didn't get it and I understand but he's cheap too oh yeah and people point
[9011.92 → 9020.04] at certain things that you have or whatever, but there's a lot of evidence you
[9020.04 → 9024.16] just got to look kind of between the lines like it took him a long time but
[9024.16 → 9030.12] eventually he broke, and he bought a bigger nicer house it took him a really
[9030.12 → 9035.80] long time and a lot of conversations and I honestly think a lot of effort but
[9035.80 → 9041.28] eventually he broke and bought a nice car, but I'm pretty sure you consulted
[9041.28 → 9046.60] everyone in your life that has any interest in finances or cars as far as I
[9046.60 → 9050.66] could tell everyone I talked to had a one-on-one conversation with you about
[9050.66 → 9055.00] it you know what a big part of that though was optics management yeah that's
[9055.00 → 9060.46] fair I wanted people I wanted people to understand that like this wasn't
[9060.46 → 9064.72] something that I was just doing overnight I wanted people to understand
[9064.72 → 9070.60] that this wasn't a first thing that came right on the heels of us doing an
[9070.60 → 9078.20] enormous bonus payout for the Christmas party and and and and and that was kind
[9078.20 → 9084.00] of the way that that was a big part of the way I justified it to myself was if I
[9084.00 → 9089.68] can afford to buy myself something nice like this then I should be able to afford
[9089.68 → 9095.92] to buy everyone else something nice and if I can't then should I really have the
[9095.92 → 9099.64] status symbol anyway does it mean anything it's like is a status symbol
[9099.64 → 9103.80] really a status symbol unless you can afford to like to give a bunch of it to
[9103.80 → 9107.56] someone else too and this if you get what I mean like this is not a change he
[9107.56 → 9116.56] would have given me that talk in 2011 so I don't know someone's pointing out
[9116.56 → 9121.12] the $7 thing in full plane shots s bow and said I don't mind spending $7 on a
[9121.12 → 9123.42] coffee if the employees are treated better than to importance treats their
[9123.42 → 9128.88] employees, and you know what sure I agree to defend his point is
[9128.88 → 9131.76] either that he's just going to go without the coffee or he'll just make it
[9131.76 → 9135.54] himself at home and I know this because neither of us drink coffee because
[9135.54 → 9140.46] we're both cheap as hell oh yeah neither of us drink alcohol neither of
[9140.46 → 9144.42] us smoke neither of us drink coffee and I bet you I can't imagine burning a
[9144.42 → 9149.58] thing I paid for a very significant part probably more than 50% of the
[9149.58 → 9153.14] motivation around not doing those things for both of us is we don't want to spend
[9153.14 → 9160.42] the money and a few of those things are addictive so we wouldn't even take it if
[9160.42 → 9163.40] it was free because there's a risk of spending money on it later I'm just
[9163.40 → 9171.44] trying to think if there's anything other than food that I have been willing to
[9171.44 → 9186.80] invest in a consumable ecosystem do you buy any consumables and there's so many
[9186.80 → 9191.72] examples yeah consumables I don't know if it's fair to say but yeah technically
[9191.72 → 9198.44] toiletries okay no okay, okay okay, okay okay, okay sorry I don't mean in terms of
[9198.44 → 9201.32] personal care when I say consumables I'm talking about
[9201.32 → 9208.70] discretionary purchases, so something like an uh someone say batteries but yeah
[9208.70 → 9213.62] here's a counter Linus spent a bunch of time in research finding the best
[9213.62 → 9217.22] rechargeable batteries so he would never have to spend money on them again and a
[9217.22 → 9219.72] loops
[9219.72 → 9226.02] and then and then I created the no batteries policy in my house yeah which
[9226.02 → 9230.28] you guys actually saw a video about when I converted a battery only actually well
[9230.28 → 9237.66] Dan did most of the work but good job where we converted a battery only temperature
[9237.66 → 9243.34] sensor for the eco bee smart thermostat into a wall-powered one so that I would
[9243.34 → 9251.86] never have to buy another battery for it no, no I refuse here's I'm going to get TMI for a
[9251.86 → 9256.52] section uh sop cannon said is birth control consume a consumable not when it's a
[9256.52 → 9259.10] vasectomy
[9259.10 → 9263.68] laundry detergent you guys you're actually wrong
[9263.68 → 9270.28] right house consumers do they count uh no it's like a requirement yeah like it is like food and
[9270.28 → 9277.40] and that sort of thing yeah okay like discretionary um honestly a big part of my personal rationalization
[9277.40 → 9281.72] for the car is at least I'm not buying gas anymore
[9281.72 → 9293.80] I'm using good old subsidized by my solar panels cheap as nothing in BC hydroelectricity let's go
[9293.80 → 9302.20] yeah so I step on that pedal with no regret yeah so like there are some things that have changed but
[9303.08 → 9308.84] they're probably a lot less than you think, and they're probably not what you think, and I would argue
[9308.84 → 9315.16] they're significantly more related to just like growing older growing a little bit wiser probably some
[9315.16 → 9320.44] amount of hormone changes stuff like that yeah kids are expensive, but I have no problem spending money on
[9320.44 → 9327.88] other people that's never really been an issue it's not really a question uh Tynan brings up uh
[9327.88 → 9335.08] shuttles for badminton yes okay badminton uh is something I spend on consumables I do have a
[9335.08 → 9341.56] counterargument for this though I also think that for the personal health personal care exactly yeah
[9341.56 → 9348.68] uh badminton is a primary personal care um method for me, it's its how I stay in shape
[9349.48 → 9355.16] so compared to what you could like a health expense almost yeah compared to what you could easily spend
[9355.16 → 9362.60] on anything else health related it's its pretty it's pretty reasonable and most of my badminton costs
[9362.60 → 9367.80] are the free badminton nights that we run for work and for some which has been community members money
[9367.80 → 9372.28] spent on other people which is money spent on other people anyway yeah I'm not trying to say
[9372.28 → 9377.08] yeah I know I know you're not after me about it Tynan often comes to batty night it's uh
[9377.08 → 9382.28] actually he and uh some of the other team members have made incredible progress it's been a
[9382.28 → 9388.60] it's been a really cool uh really cool event uh Sebastian asks RuneScape did you spend money on
[9388.60 → 9391.80] RuneScape does RuneScape cost money I don't know anything about it, I didn't spend money on RuneScape
[9391.80 → 9396.44] oh okay I don't know does it cost money, or it didn't when I played it when I was a kid oh okay
[9396.44 → 9400.36] I don't know I don't know if it does now uh Sheldon asks car air freshener are you kidding me
[9400.36 → 9406.60] no way that sounds consumable to me no I got one as a gift that was in the shape of a Game Boy
[9406.60 → 9410.60] uh years ago, and it's still there because I'm not going to replace it well aesthetically it hasn't
[9410.60 → 9419.00] changed that's exactly yeah it's still an ornament as far as I'm concerned uh so yeah and to be
[9419.00 → 9424.84] clear I'm not trying to sit here saying he's a saint I'm just saying a lot of the lot of the
[9424.84 → 9431.08] things a lot of the things that the community thinks you've changed about in my opinion are wrong
[9431.64 → 9439.48] yeah, yeah okay car tires this is a really great example exactly in exactly the same way
[9440.20 → 9447.64] I will replace a car tire if it's dangerous or worn out but while the recommendation is always to do
[9447.64 → 9451.32] them in pairs I've always been the guy to be like no only one of them is broken
[9455.96 → 9462.04] my tires are a lot more expensive now the here 's's a weird reference the both the
[9462.04 → 9468.92] air and water filter on your fridge are expired oh, oh yeah because he probably believes
[9468.92 → 9472.76] that they're overengineered no I just can't even see the light it's like an ad
[9474.60 → 9481.80] fridges has air filters uh yeah yeah yeah for the air circulation in the thing it helps keep
[9482.44 → 9486.92] uh helps keep it not stinky yeah I mean not in my fridge, but I'm in someone else's maybe
[9487.80 → 9491.80] but I think they're also overengineered I do the same thing I let mine expire for a while
[9491.80 → 9497.40] I've never changed one I need to go home and deal with this
[9499.56 → 9506.60] um okay move oh I'm not acknowledging that if people want to know what he said they can be in
[9506.60 → 9516.84] float plane chat I avoided that joke you're a bad person me no linen I want to be bundled with him
[9516.84 → 9524.04] I'm with it oh that's hilarious play now for free yeah RuneScape says play now for free they
[9524.04 → 9527.64] probably have like a premium model or something they're going to make they do have a premium model
[9527.64 → 9532.04] okay old scape is the only good scape or 2007 scape whatever the hell you want to call it yeah
[9532.04 → 9539.40] RuneScape old school it's really cool actually, but number go up it's a very good number go
[9539.40 → 9547.80] up oh that like type of game it's yeah got if it's like uh it's the precursor to a lot of them
[9548.36 → 9554.84] uh let's see hey LLD love the show and the journey LTT has been on I appreciate the renewed commitment
[9554.84 → 9562.68] to quality, but I'm wondering what are the downsides of reposting a video like secret shopper 3 part 2
[9562.68 → 9569.48] big ones yeah yeah it's uh it's bad uh I can promise you guys right now that that video will
[9569.48 → 9576.76] not perform like it would have if we had simply left it up um the far better option that can be
[9576.76 → 9583.80] available to under certain circumstances, so this is all part of our error handling sop standard operating
[9583.80 → 9589.40] procedure that we've posted on the forum um the better option is one that we outlined there which
[9589.40 → 9594.36] is if you can edit the video in a way that the runtime is exactly the same and there's like a bunch
[9594.36 → 9602.76] of other rules um in some cases you can uh submit a request to YouTube to have it replaced but if that's
[9602.76 → 9611.96] not possible our only options are to post retractions or comments or to take down the video and re-upload
[9611.96 → 9618.76] it and the problem is that both of those are bad options once you've set a video private the momentum is
[9618.76 → 9627.00] is gone, and you are just relying on YouTube to start to seed it and a big part of your audience
[9627.00 → 9630.92] has already seen it so it's going to seem like a bad video that people aren't interested in but actually
[9630.92 → 9634.60] people have just already watched it so you're going to not get a lot of reach that way and then
[9634.60 → 9639.96] re-uploading is the exact same problem not a lot of your views come from people who have subscribed and
[9639.96 → 9643.96] rang the bell nobody does that nobody clicks that notification I've actually been thinking of
[9643.96 → 9648.28] making a video for a long time called you won't click this notification uh and just
[9648.76 → 9654.04] talking about how inconsequential subscriptions and notifications are on YouTube now compared to
[9654.04 → 9659.56] recommendations um i just I haven't really gotten around to if it's the kind of thing that only I can
[9659.56 → 9663.32] realistically write instead of someone else on the team and I'm just so busy reviewing other people's
[9663.32 → 9669.16] work I rarely get to write I have one coming soon though I wrote the big screen beyond video it's that
[9669.16 → 9674.20] cool VR headset that super high fidelity one that you tried it at my place yeah crazy experience by the
[9674.20 → 9678.92] the way yeah um that was wild so i i got to write a video for a change, but that's coming soon
[9678.92 → 9685.32] uh what am I talking about right now I forget I'm gonna all right so taking it down and then
[9685.32 → 9689.40] republishing it again has the exact same problem because even though most people won't click that
[9689.40 → 9696.52] notification YouTube still uses that as an extremely strong signal for the appeal of that video to your
[9696.52 → 9701.72] audience right and so if you upload a video that has the same title as when you uploaded two days ago or
[9701.72 → 9706.76] whatever most people aren't going to click it, and they're going to go oh signal video bad um it's
[9706.76 → 9712.52] less of a problem today we had a video that we published um where we accidentally clicked an option
[9712.52 → 9724.60] that doesn't send a notification it was um here I think it was like um this one yes okay this top one
[9724.60 → 9731.64] right here what were they thinking weird 90s controllers it's got one and a half million views do I think it
[9731.64 → 9737.08] could have done a little bit better with a shove in the butt out of the gate rather than not having
[9737.08 → 9744.28] anything go to notification to people who subscribed um yeah yeah probably but overall it's done okay and
[9744.28 → 9748.36] that wouldn't have been the case you know five years prior to that ten years prior to that when
[9749.08 → 9755.96] subscriptions and notifications were basically just kind of indicative of the long-term performance of a
[9755.96 → 9762.12] video now you can have videos that do awful out of the gate and then great later or great out of the
[9762.12 → 9767.00] gate and awful later or awful then you change the title and thumbnail, and then they do great it's its
[9767.00 → 9777.24] kind of all over the place uh so i I think that ultimately secret shopper will do okay but i it's its very
[9777.24 → 9787.00] clear that there is a big downside to feeding it to you know a solid quarter to a fifth of the potential
[9787.00 → 9795.24] audience and then taking it away and then uploading it again and having lost that momentum I want to
[9795.24 → 9802.04] take a second to jump back to talking about old school RuneScape okay I just want to say this is awesome
[9802.04 → 9810.28] wow so the website if you oh hold on sorry one sec is this official yes um so I'm gonna
[9810.28 → 9815.24] I'm going to go through this really quickly okay my laptop again so you get to this website if you
[9815.24 → 9822.44] just go to runes if you just google like RuneScape you land on this website uh and I was like okay a
[9822.44 → 9826.60] classic adventure reborn everything that I hear people talk about is old school RuneScape though
[9826.60 → 9832.04] and I saw this button up here that said old school and I was like okay I guess I'll go to that
[9832.76 → 9840.36] which opened this up that is so cool I'm having flashbacks love this literally this website being
[9840.36 → 9849.32] like this makes me want to try the game I don't know and like I'm sure it's the like boomers style
[9849.32 → 9855.64] millennial brain in me just like feeling more comfortable on a website like this reminds
[9855.64 → 9861.48] me this is a website to me yeah exactly the stuff that we have now is like
[9862.36 → 9869.80] apps visual in a rectangle this is just like this you know some guy named Steve programmed this by
[9869.80 → 9875.72] hand understand too you have the external links he had a beard for sure oh yeah the box at the line
[9875.72 → 9880.36] the external links you now and then you have the internal links that are very clearly just like text
[9880.36 → 9885.56] hyperlinks you have very clear and obvious where is he to click buttons first thing my eye is going to
[9885.56 → 9890.36] is new users sign up here yeah and then I start looking around and there's more stuff it's like
[9890.36 → 9896.60] the UI is perfect yeah oh there's a news feed very easy clear to understand not even behind the fold
[9896.60 → 9905.40] kind of stuff no amazing I really like this 10 out of 10. It's great that's all I have to say if you
[9905.40 → 9911.72] were the person on that team that decided that that should work like that great choice it's absolutely fantastic
[9911.72 → 9922.44] that's it next up I guess love it hi guys my wife and I are expecting our first baby and we recently
[9922.44 → 9927.96] found out we're having a girl do you have any advice for encouraging a girl's interest in tech thanks i
[9927.96 → 9933.80] think the best advice that I could possibly give you is just don't make it different yeah well don't change
[9933.80 → 9941.32] anything, and you know engagement with tech should be meaningful it should be um educational
[9941.32 → 9949.56] to the degree that you can make it is should be um not a crutch I think that's probably the most important
[9950.76 → 9957.08] advice as someone who's been doing the parenting thing for actually a while now um is don't treat
[9957.08 → 9962.84] tech like a babysitter experience it with them be part of be part of that voyage of discovery
[9965.88 → 9970.76] what is the path not taken with LTT that you are most curious about how it would have turned out
[9978.36 → 9984.20] I mean I wasn't that curious about it until you brought it up just now but I think the path of
[9984.20 → 9991.24] converting to like an um like it like an ad agency slash production company could have been really
[9991.24 → 9997.72] interesting i I there's no way that I had that in me, i I don't think we could, it's a cutthroat world and
[9997.72 → 10004.68] and i I don't have the background there uh oh, oh okay no here uh well okay again I'm not sure if I'm
[10004.68 → 10009.48] I'm trying to think of things to be curious about uh it's not something that occupies my mind I'm more
[10009.48 → 10015.88] look forward than look back in general but remember that um that small Vancouver-based
[10015.88 → 10021.88] tech media company that wanted to acquire us very early on yeah and I'm still so happy we didn't do
[10021.88 → 10027.32] that the reason that I didn't do it was not actually because I wasn't interested they had a
[10027.32 → 10031.96] lot of experience in traditional media a lot of advertising relationships that could have poured
[10031.96 → 10039.56] rocket fuel on what we were doing the reason I didn't do it was because of ego speaking of
[10039.56 → 10046.52] things that haven't changed um whatever we being real let's be real like the people who are like Linus
[10046.52 → 10053.40] has an ego he's totally changed oh that wait what this is what I'm talking about dude you're just wrong
[10053.40 → 10060.60] if anything it might have been bigger before and to be clear like uh i I actually agree with you
[10060.60 → 10064.36] like I've been put in my place a lot of times over the years yeah this is part of what I was saying
[10064.36 → 10069.72] about softer yeah it's kind of it's still very much there, but it's kind of relaxed, and you got to
[10069.72 → 10074.92] understand like ego is not necessarily inherently a terrible thing it doesn't make you a bad person
[10074.92 → 10081.80] but it does make you behave in certain ways sometimes and in this case my my my ego did
[10082.52 → 10088.92] push me away from making a deal with them because it was clear to me that they felt that they were
[10089.48 → 10098.76] acquiring a smaller company and I saw it as a merger of equals, and it didn't even matter whether the
[10098.76 → 10107.56] company share structure was 50 50. That was not even that was not even a factor for me, it was that they
[10107.56 → 10115.24] clearly were of the mindset that I was a kid who would essentially work for the company
[10115.24 → 10121.00] and have shares in it sure or whatever because I built something really valuable to them clearly but
[10121.00 → 10132.60] that they were you know the acquiring party um and I was like no man I will uh I'll see on the other
[10132.60 → 10134.68] side or not let's see how it goes
[10134.68 → 10137.48] I was
[10137.88 → 10145.32] sorry, but that's I mean that can be hugely motivating right um I think it was oh it was very motivating
[10145.32 → 10147.80] yeah i
[10150.52 → 10158.60] I don't know if I enjoy it or if I just have to have it competition uh yeah both yeah that's a whole
[10158.60 → 10167.16] conversation right there maybe both yeah both makes sense yeah I had an interview today, and they asked
[10167.16 → 10173.40] me a question I was wondering what your response would be what is the one thing you've done professionally
[10173.40 → 10174.68] that you would never do again
[10179.96 → 10180.84] I have to pick one
[10186.20 → 10190.44] I know mine um oh man i uh
[10194.52 → 10199.88] I disclosed the sorry state of our accounts payable at NCI to a partner
[10199.88 → 10204.68] I remember that but yeah that's a good one
[10205.32 → 10210.12] um that was pretty bad like I'm all about you know honesty or whatever, but that was
[10210.12 → 10213.56] probably not that was probably above my pay grade um
[10214.92 → 10221.24] oh man shoot I was actually gonna I was actually going to say something else to man I don't know this
[10221.24 → 10225.96] is this could be an endless list of uh yeah things I've done professionally that I would never do again
[10225.96 → 10232.68] start a video delivery platform with zero dollars a budget and one uh part-time slash volunteer
[10232.68 → 10239.08] employee yeah that's mine yeah why would you do that that's so dumb yeah so actually dumb yeah
[10239.08 → 10246.68] I mean it's its been all right, but it was a lot of effort and stress and stuff yeah
[10249.24 → 10252.04] that's that's unquestionably mine was pretty easy
[10255.96 → 10261.56] there's definitely things about our hiring practices early on that I would have done differently
[10266.68 → 10271.48] we can't talk about it much without getting into some pretty personally identifiable information but
[10271.48 → 10274.20] yo like there's definitely some things we could have done better
[10275.56 → 10279.96] yeah, yeah well I mean my interview was like hours long
[10279.96 → 10286.60] I don't regret that though no that was cool that like me honestly maybe that I remember a
[10286.60 → 10290.92] very, very long and weird amount of it but yeah yeah
[10294.52 → 10299.48] oh man didn't you have to drive me home that night I think so yeah because like maybe the buses weren't
[10299.48 → 10303.00] running to where you were going or something like that yeah like I showed up when it was light out
[10303.00 → 10308.76] it's kind of wild how you can go from a job interview with a stranger to just like getting
[10308.76 → 10313.56] driven home instar bros um, but it like actually yeah it actually happened yeah yeah
[10316.68 → 10323.40] oh man would you have done it again oh yeah yeah I mean yeah I don't think there's any question for
[10323.40 → 10327.72] either of us like it was just stupid a lot of the time right but like oh yeah
[10327.72 → 10334.84] yeah we both thrive off that kind of stuff though and yeah, and it's like I don't think you can be who
[10334.84 → 10340.76] you are today and be even remotely happy with who you are and not go back and make the same decisions
[10340.76 → 10344.92] this is something we've talked about in a lot of detail on the wan show before but i just i
[10344.92 → 10350.84] couldn't change a thing like butterfly effect man what if i what is I changed something and what if i
[10350.84 → 10357.32] didn't hire Luke what if I hired someone else and I turned out to be more easily influenced than i
[10357.32 → 10364.12] think I am, and they got me into hookers and blow, and it blew up my marriage and well you laugh or
[10364.12 → 10371.16] whatever right but like this kind of stuff happens technically it had no not technically this happens
[10371.16 → 10376.68] this is one of the things that we were starting to talk to our kids about a lot is so much of whom
[10376.68 → 10382.44] you become is influenced by who's around you and five closest people or whatever we're recognizing that
[10382.44 → 10389.80] we are not going to be in that inner circle for our kids for much longer and so the best way that
[10389.80 → 10395.64] we can influence them into the future is to try to influence who will be influencing them we recognize
[10395.64 → 10403.16] it's not going to be us, and so i i I count as one of the like I don't know what you want to call it
[10403.16 → 10412.12] luckiest or I don't think it was just luck because i i I was in a bunch of different circles at various
[10412.12 → 10418.28] times and i kind of curated this group but yeah the like g vet guys yeah yeah his like gamer crew
[10418.28 → 10419.48] yeah, but they're also like
[10422.28 → 10426.68] probably the people that I'm closest with even though I don't see some of them for like a year at a time
[10426.68 → 10431.32] yeah because we're adults now we're adult males and that's just like a thing that we do for whatever
[10431.32 → 10439.40] reason but like i am solitary creature quite deeply it's true though it's alone in the dark kind of sad
[10439.40 → 10447.88] but it's true uh but I like deeply respect all of those guys um I don't know i could talk at
[10447.88 → 10452.84] length about why you know I wouldn't have made the exact same choices that they did but I respect why
[10452.84 → 10457.72] they did it and I understand why it was good for them and these are people that push hard to get
[10457.72 → 10462.36] things done push hard to advance themselves and their careers and they're the lives of the people
[10462.36 → 10468.36] around them which is very respectable people um and if that wasn't true if that wasn't the case
[10469.88 → 10474.84] I mean I know people I'm not going to name anyone but I know people that went down certain paths that
[10474.84 → 10479.64] I think were terrible for them because the people around them were doing those things yeah 100 I mean
[10479.64 → 10486.44] I think we I think we like to think that we're you know we have our own mind, and we have our own uh
[10486.44 → 10495.16] we set our own course or whatever else but if we're being 100 honest with ourselves
[10497.72 → 10506.84] I think that we are in a position where we are privileged to be able to have our own path and make our own
[10506.84 → 10513.40] decisions um and feel that way if we'd had a very, very different start we might not be in that
[10513.40 → 10518.28] position today which is just another way of saying that we could have been easily influenced we got a
[10518.28 → 10523.24] little lucky, and maybe we worked hard, but maybe we also got a little bit lucky I don't think you can
[10523.24 → 10529.00] I don't think you can achieve success without some of both I think resisting peer pressure is also like
[10529.00 → 10539.88] incredibly important yep but I mean okay not going to get too personal here but um there are I think
[10539.88 → 10548.12] situations where being completely oblivious to the needs and wants of the people around you is also not
[10548.12 → 10555.24] helpful and sometimes like doing things that you know are dumb because its fun is okay yeah and
[10555.24 → 10559.16] sometimes depends on the thing sometimes doing something that isn't what you want to be doing
[10559.16 → 10564.52] right now but isn't dangerous and just because someone else wants to do it is okay and if they
[10564.52 → 10570.60] do peer pressure you yeah maybe they shouldn't have done that, but these are social mechanisms
[10570.60 → 10577.00] that have evolved over tens or hundreds of thousands of years right like let's not pretend that all of a
[10577.00 → 10583.00] sudden we're going to go oh peer pressure bad that's not going to happen any more um and there's
[10583.00 → 10589.88] something to be said for creating a social network by sometimes doing what you want to do and sometimes
[10589.88 → 10594.60] doing what other people want to do and sometimes one of the tools that people are going to use to
[10595.32 → 10599.08] you know get the group to do something together is going to be peer pressure you just have to also
[10599.72 → 10605.32] have a good head on your shoulders and avoid it when it's problematic yeah and this kind of nuance like
[10605.32 → 10612.12] i I can understand why adults worry about kids yeah they could get it now like my brother and I were both
[10612.12 → 10621.88] very stubborn not very pure pleasurable people um and as I've grown up I think I've recognized more
[10621.88 → 10626.92] and more like even when I was a kid that was something I valued about myself I was just like no
[10626.92 → 10631.24] if I don't want to do this thing you're not going to get me to do if it's just not going to happen
[10631.24 → 10636.36] and I like I liked that about myself but now that I'm getting older I'm just like wow there's a few
[10636.36 → 10642.52] situations that I remember being in that like if I wasn't that way could have been terrible yeah
[10642.52 → 10649.56] like terrible I'm just like okay that's a pretty cool happy that worked out, but you got a little
[10649.56 → 10654.92] lucky probably the fact that you even just sort of had that attitude of wanting to
[10656.44 → 10664.12] you know do your own thing uh you can't take that for granted no yeah yeah all right
[10664.12 → 10671.40] with the as-a-service model seemingly invading every market do you think will ever be a tipping
[10671.40 → 10677.00] point where the market pushes back and wants to outright own or manage these products themselves
[10677.96 → 10683.64] I mean I think the entire open source software movement was just going to say is what you're talking
[10683.64 → 10689.80] about and there's a ton of momentum there I mean uh oh one of the topics that we didn't get to this
[10689.80 → 10699.08] week this is a great segue into it um Qualcomm is working on their first risk 5 processor design
[10699.08 → 10706.52] it's not going to be a full-on smartphone chip out of the gate but in collaboration with Google
[10707.16 → 10715.88] they are building risk 5 snapdragons for wearable devices that's incredible, and you know what arm from
[10715.88 → 10729.72] my understanding of it has a relatively um amenable licensing situation, but nobody likes paying
[10729.72 → 10736.36] forever for something when they can spend money on it once and own it forever and I think that's where
[10736.36 → 10741.48] that's that's where risk 5 is going to come in and in the medium to long term
[10741.48 → 10750.60] close the gap with x86 and arm all right sorry with arm and even to a degree I think x86 in the very
[10750.60 → 10751.40] very long term
[10756.44 → 10764.44] I have never used the preset buttons on my microwave for example popcorn or chicken etc yeah me neither if
[10764.44 → 10769.24] an AI could actually predict the right settings do you think you would use it for your appliances
[10769.80 → 10775.64] so my understanding uh technology connections did a video on this like super advanced microwave from the
[10775.64 → 10783.16] 90s um my understanding is what you're talking about does exist and did exist and only doesn't exist now
[10783.16 → 10791.32] because it's just way more profitable to crap out cheap commodity garbage microwaves um and nobody really
[10791.32 → 10797.64] appreciates that level of product development anymore like there's no reason that a popcorn setting
[10797.64 → 10805.16] wouldn't work perfectly every time but mine burns the popcorn on my like model year 2021 microwave even though
[10805.88 → 10812.36] it should just have a microphone that detects popcorn popping waits for about whatever it says on the
[10812.36 → 10817.24] bag like I think it's about a two-second delay in between kernels popping and then just stops right but
[10817.24 → 10823.16] they don't work that way as far as I can tell it's just a timer still so um yeah I think people would
[10823.16 → 10829.08] use them but as it is no I don't use them and actually back to popcorn it's explicitly saying on at
[10829.08 → 10833.00] least the ones that I have not to use that setting because it doesn't work properly
[10837.24 → 10844.68] hi Linus and Luke long time fan finally buying this awesome water bottle quick question micro SD external
[10844.68 → 10850.92] SSD or large format USB stick for storing movie library long term five to ten years
[10856.20 → 10865.64] micro SD USB or what basically they're all flash so with that in mind I would use whatever uses high
[10865.64 → 10873.88] quality flash and the most likely of those products to use quality NAND flash would be a SSD they tend to
[10873.88 → 10880.52] use better controllers they tend to use better flash um USB sticks and micro SD just use whatever the
[10880.52 → 10889.40] the cheapest possible garbage is because unless you are spending extra money on a really you know good one
[10889.40 → 10895.32] and even than a lot of the time it won't matter it'll just be garbage anyway um they are going to be the
[10895.32 → 10902.20] cheapest didn't make the cut for proper flash products possible chips
[10904.36 → 10909.24] what about uh things like bit rot and other stuff I've heard because I've had DVDs that disintegrate
[10909.24 → 10914.12] and hard drives have the same sort of issue yeah nothing's going to be perfect i um magnetic tape
[10914.12 → 10923.48] three two one right how about oh yeah that that yeah three two one um okay after amazing customer
[10923.48 → 10929.88] service from LTT store on something I broke compared to the worst I've experienced from geek squad what is
[10929.88 → 10932.68] the worst RMA or customer experience you guys have had
[10932.68 → 10945.72] i I can say the best for me was VGA like hands down the worst nobody's came close but I've also
[10945.72 → 10951.32] never had to use LDT store or like float plane customer support so I don't know I don't know man
[10951.32 → 10957.16] I've had a lot of pretty bad experiences uh I haven't had many but I've had to return very few things my
[10957.16 → 10968.12] pool company it's still not like actually done, done they're awful yeah they are they're they're just
[10968.12 → 10975.08] they're awful um they don't show up when they say they will, they show up without telling you they will
[10975.08 → 10982.04] so they'll like to come in quickly fix a couple of things not everything that is outstanding and
[10982.04 → 10987.72] they'll like to take off, and you're like whoa hey uh yeah they're they're awful
[10991.24 → 10997.88] hi Linus and Luke uh, uh no that's the same one it just got pushed down I work in pro audio video
[10997.88 → 11003.56] and products are ditching local config for cloud-based config which is a good way to end up with a
[11003.56 → 11008.28] paperweight if a company goes under yeah that's bad what products have you seen this happen to
[11008.28 → 11014.60] routers was routers access points maybe yeah those access points that you have the
[11014.60 → 11025.08] um Merck are they Merck I think so the one that you have uh no not any more oh, oh had for sure
[11025.08 → 11027.24] was it Merck couldn't be
[11030.44 → 11034.68] I thought they had like a different like entry level it was like a Cisco sub-brand or
[11034.68 → 11039.24] something like that yeah right that's their sub-brand, but that's their like really high-end
[11039.24 → 11048.52] stuff um maybe I'm mistaken anyway yeah anything that has a dashboard this is actually
[11048.52 → 11053.80] what turned me off of the uh Merck go access point requires an active subscription
[11054.60 → 11058.04] oh is that the one I don't know if it was a go this was a long time ago
[11058.76 → 11064.60] but it was a Merck access point I'm pretty sure that required a subscription yeah the um the like
[11064.60 → 11069.64] cost as much as a car automated cleaning robot that I had looked at for the badminton centre
[11069.64 → 11074.36] I was like hey so how does the configuration work can it be done locally in the
[11074.36 → 11078.20] event that you guys don't exist anymore, and their response was don't worry we'll exist
[11078.20 → 11082.04] I went yeah I'm not going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a robot that
[11083.32 → 11087.56] all of a sudden doesn't work anymore if you guys don't support it anymore that's absolutely ridiculous
[11087.56 → 11089.56] um
[11093.00 → 11101.32] man I mean we've seen it happen to lots of products I have tried not to invest in many that I foresee
[11101.32 → 11106.36] that being a possibility with I've been really lucky I've been really lucky so far uh Sonos got real
[11106.36 → 11113.48] close for a little bit there with the s1 s2 app split so far they have continued to support their legacy
[11113.48 → 11116.84] s1 products um well enough that I'm happy with it
[11121.64 → 11125.72] and the rest are just potentials if you guys want to have a look through those sure I don't have a good
[11125.72 → 11130.92] answer for this one, but it's such a good question that I want to say it anonymous asks what is
[11130.92 → 11135.80] a proverbial hill that you would die on that few people know about
[11137.88 → 11140.60] huh I was trying to think of I feel like through wackos we would have
[11141.72 → 11147.40] exposed a lot of these I mean I have pet peeves but I know that I have a hill that i die on but
[11147.40 → 11153.40] every time it comes up I go absolutely apoplectic but what is it I can't remember what it is it's
[11153.40 → 11159.72] probably some absolutely innocuous little tiny thing um that is very much like a hill you die on
[11159.72 → 11164.28] like it doesn't have to be big or important yeah fair enough if it was big and important I would
[11164.28 → 11169.72] probably um you know have some rational explanation I'm sure I have them too, or maybe it would be a thing
[11169.72 → 11174.44] people know about but for it to be something that people know about yeah the problem is that they
[11174.44 → 11183.96] don't know it I don't even know I'm just trying I'm I'm loading up my video idea tracker here
[11183.96 → 11188.76] because I'm sure there's something in here that you know would occur to no one else but uh
[11188.76 → 11204.84] uh buying high-end computers is stupid yeah but I think everyone kind of knows that like we do it
[11204.84 → 11211.24] anyway because it gives us satisfaction or whatever but like number go up you're so much better off
[11211.24 → 11218.04] buying a mid-range pc every three years than a high-end one every you know six years or whatever
[11218.04 → 11223.88] the math works out where it works out too, but then you're never having the high-end experience you
[11223.88 → 11225.16] know um
[11234.20 → 11240.28] man there's a lot of weird stuff in here
[11241.64 → 11242.28] um
[11242.28 → 11252.04] all right i uh I'm not going to find anything useful for this I feel like as a media personality I think
[11252.04 → 11259.24] that's the problem I spend four hours a week basically is that how long wan show is now I think
[11259.24 → 11263.56] it's like three or four hours around there talking about everything that could possibly come to my mind
[11263.56 → 11268.44] to the point where I don't even after wan show I don't even really like talking yeah and like even
[11268.44 → 11272.44] sometimes the next day I'm just like yeah I'm just like kind of done talking for now that's that's it
[11272.44 → 11277.24] that's all I got um so i just I don't have that much to share i just I feel like
[11277.88 → 11283.32] which was surprisingly draining I want to I want to highlight that question so you guys can you know
[11283.88 → 11289.32] use it to start a conversation with someone in your life cool that you want to have a good chat with uh
[11289.32 → 11294.68] Chris e asks any reason build redux wasn't included in secret shopper despite being a past sponsor
[11294.68 → 11302.52] I'm actually not sure why build redux would have or wouldn't have been included uh I was somebody
[11302.52 → 11308.36] pointed out that they're a subsidiary of something digital storm yeah digital storm's not in it either
[11308.36 → 11313.48] oh I don't remember why we do or don't include digital storm a lot of the placements in secret
[11313.48 → 11319.32] shopper are as much because we've shopped them already like I don't know how main gears business
[11319.32 → 11323.16] is going I don't know how relevant or not relevant they are today compared to when we did the first
[11323.16 → 11327.24] one four or five years ago or whatever it was you're just doing repeats um, but then we added
[11327.24 → 11335.32] star forge because they are highly relevant and then cyber power um was added because we had attempted to
[11335.32 → 11339.88] secret shop them in the past, but they hadn't ended up participating because they didn't provide
[11339.88 → 11343.40] recommendations and our whole thing is we buy whatever you recommend to us
[11345.64 → 11353.00] maybe we'll expand it in the future, but this was already a lot of systems to do
[11353.16 → 11362.04] uh somebody's asking uh I'll just curate it so it can be shown um there we go I think I did the
[11362.04 → 11367.80] thing yeah how do these hoodies hold up in the gym how do the dropout hoodies hold up in the gym
[11367.80 → 11372.68] um I don't think we would technically know yeah they just launched yeah um but
[11373.56 → 11378.20] seems like it would be pretty good a good hoodie I mean I wouldn't personally wear a hoodie to work out
[11378.20 → 11383.08] some people do that I think they want the sweat I don't like it I think we're too sweaty already
[11383.08 → 11389.96] yeah no yeah more sweat I mean I dude i I know it's like you're supposed to do it but a lot of
[11389.96 → 11395.80] people don't I carry around the like rag and wash bottle because when I'm done using a bench it's just
[11398.60 → 11403.56] i have to i have to clean it sometimes I have to mop down a badminton court after I play on it
[11403.56 → 11411.96] dude you've he sweat through his shoe through the whole thing okay that was wild that
[11411.96 → 11420.36] was crazy, and it was not like I don't know how to describe this it was like it was obviously
[11420.36 → 11426.28] I didn't know this before, but it was obviously a multi-piece sole because I went through the sole
[11426.28 → 11432.20] it was not dripping around it was like a spot in the sole where clearly some pieces of rubber were like
[11432.20 → 11439.00] fitted together or separated to some degree yeah and I would step, and it would squish and some sweat
[11439.00 → 11444.68] would come through it come out it was very hot that day wild absolutely wild
[11448.36 → 11454.76] yeah hey LLD love the show Linus any issues with the pool cooling are we going to get an update on how
[11454.76 → 11461.00] it's all running absolutely the there's a video coming where we're going to deploy all the systems
[11461.00 → 11464.92] there's another video coming man we've got a lot of videos shot but not released right now
[11464.92 → 11472.04] um there's another video coming where we make some changes to the cooling system to help cool the room
[11472.04 → 11479.00] more because I realized there's a fatal flaw in the entire setup I added the five systems right with pool
[11479.00 → 11485.32] cooling so that I could cool the room but all the heat that I'm removing is net new heat so if the room's
[11485.32 → 11492.44] too hot now it's still going to be too hot so we had to think outside the box a little bit in order to
[11492.44 → 11499.64] remove some heat from the room it's pretty good now though I'm like really stoked all right last one from
[11499.64 → 11507.64] Tyler I only got a used GPU after your testing video and ended up getting the best deal of my life VGA 3090
[11507.64 → 11513.72] with an EK water block an EK pump a radiator and a thousand watt Asus power supply for seven hundred dollars on
[11513.72 → 11519.72] Facebook that's what I could what was your best deal ever I think mine might be the
[11521.40 → 11528.28] was it r r2 how do you say that it's a 200 but that GPU that I got in the first scrapyard wars was
[11528.28 → 11538.52] insane oh the uh 2900 whatever Hawaii 2900 yeah oh wait 79 70 what did you have in the first one I thought
[11538.52 → 11545.72] it was a 290x or something no or 290 r9 290 yeah that's the one yeah yeah yeah it was code name
[11545.72 → 11550.28] Hawaii I don't remember what the stupid card is pretty sick deal that was a very honestly a lot of
[11550.28 → 11556.04] them for probably both of us you're going to find it in scrapyard wars one of my best ones I don't know if
[11556.04 → 11560.28] I would remember my best one I used to do a lot of wheeling and dealing uh one of my best ones was
[11560.28 → 11572.04] definitely the dual 7800 GTX's that I picked up yeah buddy was upgrading out of cross grading
[11572.04 → 11575.88] uh from dual 7800 GTX's to dual
[11579.56 → 11587.72] uh 1900 ATX's in crossfire that I think would have been the generational equivalent 1800 it doesn't matter
[11587.72 → 11594.44] I think it was 1900 ATX's uh or ATX's, and it was he was one of those people that just
[11595.64 → 11603.00] bought to play with it and just I don't think he cared about money at all, and he just wanted to get
[11603.00 → 11612.44] rid of them quickly I saw it I was like I'll take both I ran those for like maybe a couple of weeks but i
[11612.44 → 11618.60] was terrified that some news would come out that another generation of cards was coming and the
[11618.60 → 11624.92] value would go down so I flipped them but i I sold those for like a couple of hundred dollars profit yeah
[11624.92 → 11631.32] just buy low sell high sick um i I was big into that when I was in high school I don't know if this
[11631.32 → 11636.76] counts but like actually my best one would probably be when I was back in the intel insider program due to
[11636.76 → 11642.92] being a part of geek swag oh yeah man I got accounts I got so many colleagues to give me their
[11642.92 → 11648.20] account credentials so I could go and do surveys for them so I could pick up more i more SSDs
[11648.84 → 11659.32] because I wanted a SSD raid array like very early on so I had um I had four intel x25 dash m80 gigs
[11659.32 → 11666.04] and so that was yeah like 300 gigs that's that's that's enough um and I paid like a fraction of what
[11666.04 → 11674.92] they were worth at retail that was pretty sick setup yeah uh there's lots of money but cheapskate
[11674.92 → 11681.72] yeah, yeah work the angles yeah exactly last one I'll blast out is uh Dan and Luke any favourite
[11681.72 → 11686.76] Starfield mods yet besides the necessary basics like star UI Dan any progress on your bird mod or any
[11686.76 → 11692.84] others um I don't know I like the colour correction one and then i kind of just fell out of love with
[11692.84 → 11700.12] the game yep sounds about right uh for me, it's not going to bother collection constellation v2 because
[11700.12 → 11707.24] then it does it all for you oh yeah that's a that's a good idea yeah yeah unfortunately I've moved on to
[11707.24 → 11714.20] other things finding time to game is hard that's my biggest problem right now yeah I haven't I haven't
[11714.20 → 11719.24] actually moved on from it but I haven't been playing as much because like many games Alex Clark
[11719.24 → 11726.44] has just been Alex Clark is boned do you know he's a huge city skylines guy oh no do you know he's
[11726.44 → 11733.00] also a huge like rally racing game guy yeah WRC is coming out WRC is coming and city skylines 2 is
[11733.00 → 11741.16] coming like right now stop making good games you know how I know this we actually have deals with both of
[11741.16 → 11749.24] them and Alex is on point because he loves no those series that poor man yeah so he has to spend all
[11749.24 → 11753.00] of his time working on videos about them instead of playing them it's great it's like tantalizing
[11753.00 → 11757.80] that's pretty funny I love if it's pretty good and I love telling you good night thank you guys for
