[0.00 --> 4.80]  you're in life
[4.80 --> 7.82]  sick
[7.82 --> 8.40]  what
[8.40 --> 9.62]  what
[9.62 --> 14.20]  really
[14.20 --> 19.96]  what's up everyone welcome to the WAN show
[19.96 --> 22.30]  we've got a fantastic show lined up
[22.30 --> 24.24]  for you today first and foremost
[24.24 --> 26.26]  as you guys can see from the title we've got to talk
[26.26 --> 28.46]  about what shameless shills we are
[28.46 --> 30.30]  shilling for Asus
[30.30 --> 32.16]  and sponsored by them and not
[32.16 --> 34.34]  addressing the big controversy which obviously
[34.34 --> 36.14]  we'll be talking about on the WAN show why we usually
[36.14 --> 38.30]  talk about such things we're also going to be talking
[38.30 --> 39.58]  about Google I.O.
[40.00 --> 42.00]  man it was an AI
[42.00 --> 44.08]  extravaganza
[44.08 --> 46.40]  this year what else we got this week
[46.40 --> 48.42]  YouTube blocks ad
[48.42 --> 50.34]  block what counter block
[50.34 --> 52.28]  no I'm going to block their
[52.28 --> 53.32]  block of my block
[53.32 --> 56.44]  I don't know how to follow
[56.44 --> 57.26]  that out
[57.26 --> 59.96]  cause you got blocked
[59.96 --> 61.56]  oh man
[61.56 --> 63.20]  we already talked about the
[63.20 --> 65.24]  former Uber CSO being found
[65.24 --> 67.06]  guilty for concealing a data breach so
[67.06 --> 69.22]  maybe we should talk about how a Chinese
[69.22 --> 70.38]  company released a
[70.38 --> 72.82]  new CPU
[72.82 --> 75.24]  oh okay we could also talk
[75.24 --> 77.18]  about smart watches that you can
[77.18 --> 78.48]  no longer set the time on
[78.48 --> 81.32]  oh wow yeah what
[81.32 --> 82.92]  I rolled the intro
[82.92 --> 84.52]  you can't see cause we don't have to preview
[84.52 --> 84.76]  that
[84.76 --> 85.22]  yeah
[85.22 --> 103.42]  the show is brought to you today by
[103.42 --> 104.04]  Asus
[104.04 --> 104.42]  Square
[104.42 --> 105.92]  oh sorry I wasn't supposed to say that part
[105.92 --> 106.74]  Squarespace
[106.74 --> 107.86]  Seasonic
[107.86 --> 108.38]  and
[108.38 --> 109.34]  JumpCloud
[109.34 --> 110.66]  alright guys
[110.66 --> 112.34]  in all seriousness
[112.34 --> 114.68]  we've got to talk about the big
[114.68 --> 116.42]  controversy that has been
[116.42 --> 118.82]  making big waves
[118.82 --> 121.06]  in the techosphere over the last
[121.06 --> 123.00]  I mean realistically the whole thing
[123.00 --> 124.32]  started a few weeks ago
[124.32 --> 126.52]  when we saw that CPU that got
[126.52 --> 128.12]  popped and burned on the bottom
[128.12 --> 129.92]  we talked about that on WAN Show
[129.92 --> 132.06]  we did talk about that on WAN Show
[132.06 --> 132.82]  some people have said
[132.82 --> 134.62]  hey what's up with you guys not talking about this
[134.62 --> 135.48]  at all we actually did
[135.48 --> 137.72]  and then we've been kind of waiting to learn more
[137.72 --> 140.00]  and learn more we have
[140.00 --> 142.36]  Gamers Nexus has completed
[142.36 --> 143.78]  their series of videos
[143.78 --> 144.94]  about what's been going on
[144.94 --> 146.60]  with Ryzen X3D chips
[146.60 --> 147.78]  that have been
[147.78 --> 149.78]  well I think blowing up
[149.78 --> 151.38]  is probably a little bit melodramatic
[151.38 --> 153.50]  but burning up is certainly
[153.50 --> 155.04]  a way that we could describe them
[155.04 --> 157.72]  due to higher than anticipated voltages
[157.72 --> 158.50]  being applied
[158.50 --> 161.46]  by particularly some motherboard manufacturers
[161.46 --> 163.00]  BIOSes and Asus
[163.00 --> 165.76]  seems to be at the center of this controversy
[165.76 --> 167.78]  now there's been a lot of questions
[167.78 --> 168.84]  under our review
[168.84 --> 170.36]  of the ROG ally
[170.36 --> 171.98]  that went up yesterday
[171.98 --> 173.08]  asking why that
[173.08 --> 177.56]  you know I didn't even say the word
[177.56 --> 178.90]  because I couldn't find my swear button
[178.90 --> 179.56]  the point is
[179.56 --> 182.04]  why haven't we addressed this
[182.04 --> 184.28]  and why are we shilling for Asus
[184.28 --> 186.64]  when everyone else is mad
[186.64 --> 187.70]  trying to
[187.70 --> 188.50]  okay
[188.50 --> 190.30]  you wouldn't like him when he's angry
[190.30 --> 192.98]  it was a review of a handheld
[192.98 --> 195.70]  that was the embargo lift day
[195.70 --> 199.08]  there was no coordinated anything
[199.08 --> 200.02]  if it was sponsored
[200.02 --> 200.62]  you'd know
[200.62 --> 201.46]  because it would have said
[201.46 --> 203.08]  it was sponsored by Dbrand
[203.08 --> 204.92]  for crying out loud
[204.92 --> 206.62]  it's a showcase or something right
[206.62 --> 206.94]  look
[206.94 --> 208.26]  I've had enough
[208.26 --> 210.06]  I've had my fair share of controversies
[210.06 --> 211.30]  over the last couple of years
[211.30 --> 212.58]  and in some cases
[212.58 --> 214.08]  man I had it coming
[214.08 --> 216.70]  but this is one of those ones
[216.70 --> 217.52]  that I'm looking at going
[217.52 --> 218.46]  hey hold on
[218.46 --> 218.96]  wait a minute
[218.96 --> 219.66]  what
[219.66 --> 222.22]  we don't even review motherboards
[222.22 --> 226.22]  and haven't for like a really long time
[226.22 --> 228.14]  the one motherboard video
[228.14 --> 230.58]  that we've uploaded in the last year
[230.58 --> 233.22]  was on some weird one
[233.22 --> 234.30]  that we got off Reddit
[234.30 --> 236.78]  that had an AMD CPU socket
[236.78 --> 238.82]  but was a Z490 chipset
[238.82 --> 239.74]  it was some chipset
[239.74 --> 241.42]  that never got released
[241.42 --> 241.96]  and we're like
[241.96 --> 242.44]  hey cool
[242.44 --> 243.34]  I want to play with that
[243.34 --> 244.12]  yeah that's a little different
[244.12 --> 245.76]  we don't review motherboards
[245.76 --> 246.96]  so the reason that
[246.96 --> 248.38]  we haven't covered it yet
[248.38 --> 249.80]  is because there hasn't been
[249.80 --> 250.64]  WAN show yet
[250.64 --> 252.82]  that's why we didn't cover it
[252.82 --> 253.62]  also man
[253.62 --> 255.68]  the conspiracy theories
[255.68 --> 256.44]  nope you're a shell
[256.44 --> 257.86]  the conspiracy theories
[257.86 --> 259.36]  about how paid off
[259.36 --> 261.04]  that ROG ally video was
[261.04 --> 262.70]  I don't even know what
[262.70 --> 264.24]  I don't even know what to tell you guys
[264.24 --> 265.44]  we opened the video
[265.44 --> 266.88]  criticizing Asus
[266.88 --> 268.20]  for their shady marketing
[268.20 --> 268.86]  of the thing
[268.86 --> 271.18]  because I was pissed
[271.18 --> 273.18]  I got brought in
[273.18 --> 274.10]  to do this preview
[274.10 --> 275.04]  where they go
[275.04 --> 275.50]  okay
[275.50 --> 276.14]  you know
[276.14 --> 277.24]  yeah blah blah blah
[277.24 --> 278.64]  up to two times faster
[278.64 --> 280.22]  and then I'm sitting here going
[280.22 --> 281.30]  okay now that we've tested
[281.30 --> 282.14]  this more extensively
[282.14 --> 283.26]  these up to's
[283.26 --> 284.10]  are not great
[284.10 --> 286.52]  so the first thing we did
[286.52 --> 287.64]  was go after them
[287.64 --> 288.58]  for shady marketing
[288.58 --> 290.46]  do you honestly
[290.46 --> 292.02]  search your soul
[292.02 --> 294.38]  do you honestly believe
[294.38 --> 296.58]  that anyone at Asus Marketing
[296.58 --> 299.22]  approved us criticizing
[299.22 --> 300.52]  their shady marketing
[300.52 --> 309.66]  anyway
[309.66 --> 312.78]  the truth is
[312.78 --> 314.46]  almost a week
[314.46 --> 316.00]  before Jay posted his video
[316.00 --> 317.52]  we had already informed
[317.52 --> 319.08]  Asus that if they didn't deal
[319.08 --> 320.82]  with some unrelated issues
[320.82 --> 322.52]  related to customer service
[322.52 --> 323.28]  that had popped up
[323.28 --> 323.80]  on our forum
[323.80 --> 324.94]  we were going to be putting
[324.94 --> 326.24]  all of our sponsor deals
[326.24 --> 327.52]  with them on pause
[327.52 --> 328.68]  the good news
[328.68 --> 330.16]  is that we can kind of
[330.16 --> 331.02]  get through everything
[331.02 --> 332.14]  that they have said
[332.14 --> 333.10]  in response to that
[333.10 --> 334.90]  as well as the update
[334.90 --> 335.52]  that we've gotten
[335.52 --> 336.32]  from them today
[336.32 --> 337.40]  about what they're doing
[337.40 --> 338.22]  regarding the whole
[338.22 --> 339.26]  beta bio situation
[339.26 --> 340.80]  but before we do that
[340.80 --> 342.74]  we need to catch you guys up
[342.74 --> 343.92]  if you're not sure
[343.92 --> 344.70]  what the heck
[344.70 --> 345.76]  has been going on
[345.76 --> 348.08]  so Asus responded
[348.08 --> 349.50]  to the overheating
[349.50 --> 350.64]  slash burning up
[350.64 --> 351.30]  I think is really
[351.30 --> 352.22]  a better way to put it
[352.22 --> 353.36]  overheating issue
[353.36 --> 354.54]  with Ryzen 7000
[354.54 --> 355.52]  X3D chips
[355.52 --> 357.56]  with a rapid beta
[357.56 --> 358.70]  BIOS update
[358.70 --> 359.42]  which was supposed
[359.42 --> 360.74]  to cap SOC voltage
[360.74 --> 362.04]  to 1.3 volts
[362.04 --> 364.12]  that beta BIOS was
[364.12 --> 365.38]  and still is
[365.38 --> 366.32]  on some pages at least
[366.32 --> 367.72]  labeled with a disclaimer
[367.72 --> 368.46]  indicating that
[368.46 --> 369.36]  installing it
[369.36 --> 370.38]  would void
[370.38 --> 371.80]  the user's warranty
[371.80 --> 373.68]  so the perception
[373.68 --> 374.24]  was
[374.24 --> 375.66]  I'm sorry
[375.66 --> 377.40]  I bought your product
[377.40 --> 378.42]  okay
[378.42 --> 379.96]  and my options are
[379.96 --> 380.48]  either
[380.48 --> 381.92]  I have it die
[381.92 --> 383.14]  or
[383.14 --> 385.16]  I maybe
[385.16 --> 386.76]  still have it
[386.76 --> 387.20]  die
[387.20 --> 387.52]  but
[387.52 --> 389.64]  I can apply the fix
[389.64 --> 390.30]  but then I get
[390.30 --> 391.12]  no warranty
[391.12 --> 392.94]  are you for real
[392.94 --> 394.04]  now
[394.04 --> 395.24]  Asus claims
[395.24 --> 396.22]  that this is
[396.22 --> 397.24]  standard boilerplate
[397.24 --> 397.66]  legalese
[397.66 --> 398.28]  that is attached
[398.28 --> 399.44]  to all of their
[399.44 --> 400.30]  beta BIOSes
[400.30 --> 401.28]  and that seems true
[401.28 --> 402.24]  that actually
[402.24 --> 403.00]  we did actually
[403.00 --> 403.54]  check that
[403.54 --> 404.64]  so we used
[404.64 --> 405.50]  an archived version
[405.50 --> 406.22]  of Asus's site
[406.22 --> 406.88]  from last year
[406.88 --> 408.04]  that actually does
[408.04 --> 409.04]  appear to be attached
[409.04 --> 410.18]  to all of their
[410.18 --> 411.12]  beta BIOSes
[411.12 --> 412.46]  they told us
[412.46 --> 413.22]  that they did not
[413.22 --> 414.22]  intend to communicate
[414.22 --> 414.84]  that they wouldn't
[414.84 --> 415.96]  respect users warranties
[415.96 --> 417.10]  and that they will
[417.10 --> 417.90]  honor the warranty
[417.90 --> 418.38]  of any user
[418.38 --> 419.52]  affected by the beta BIOS
[419.52 --> 420.88]  Expo enabled or not
[420.88 --> 422.36]  this is really good news
[422.36 --> 424.28]  and is something that
[424.28 --> 424.76]  you know
[424.76 --> 425.38]  quite frankly
[425.38 --> 426.98]  I would have expected
[426.98 --> 428.04]  from them anyway
[428.04 --> 429.12]  Asus is
[429.12 --> 432.98]  here hold on
[432.98 --> 433.40]  we've got
[433.40 --> 433.96]  this is
[433.96 --> 434.60]  this is great
[434.60 --> 435.32]  I've got
[435.32 --> 436.34]  I've got a quote in here
[436.34 --> 437.20]  from I think Riley
[437.20 --> 438.04]  was actually working
[438.04 --> 438.72]  on this topic
[438.72 --> 439.74]  in the doc
[439.74 --> 441.96]  yeah here we go
[441.96 --> 443.92]  some more takeaways
[443.92 --> 444.74]  from our calls
[444.74 --> 445.30]  with Asus
[445.30 --> 445.96]  that Riley was
[445.96 --> 446.48]  involved in
[446.48 --> 447.56]  they say they were
[447.56 --> 448.12]  more focused
[448.12 --> 449.20]  on fixing the issue
[449.20 --> 450.30]  and making sure
[450.30 --> 451.10]  customers weren't
[451.10 --> 452.04]  continuing to damage
[452.04 --> 452.68]  their boards
[452.68 --> 453.56]  than they were
[453.56 --> 454.60]  focused on PR
[454.60 --> 455.84]  yeah
[455.84 --> 458.04]  that's pretty obvious
[458.04 --> 459.64]  because the PR job
[459.64 --> 460.50]  that they've done here
[460.50 --> 462.38]  is atrocious
[462.38 --> 463.90]  and I wish I could say
[463.90 --> 464.48]  that this was an
[464.48 --> 465.34]  isolated incident
[465.34 --> 466.56]  but they are
[466.56 --> 468.68]  spectacularly
[468.68 --> 469.40]  bad
[469.40 --> 470.28]  at communication
[470.28 --> 471.66]  and they are
[471.66 --> 473.40]  spectacularly bad
[473.40 --> 474.26]  at creating
[474.26 --> 474.96]  action plans
[474.96 --> 475.40]  sometimes
[475.40 --> 475.96]  I mean this is
[475.96 --> 476.56]  the kind of thing
[476.56 --> 477.14]  that you see
[477.14 --> 477.66]  often
[477.66 --> 478.60]  when you've got
[478.60 --> 479.06]  a company
[479.06 --> 480.06]  where there's
[480.06 --> 481.20]  a regional branch
[481.20 --> 481.98]  that is engaging
[481.98 --> 483.22]  directly with consumers
[483.22 --> 484.36]  in this case
[484.36 --> 485.36]  Asus USA
[485.36 --> 486.40]  or North America
[486.40 --> 486.86]  really is
[486.86 --> 487.94]  they cover the whole region
[487.94 --> 489.10]  and then you've got
[489.10 --> 489.78]  a Taiwanese
[489.78 --> 491.08]  head office branch
[491.08 --> 491.92]  that makes all
[491.92 --> 493.12]  the actual decisions
[493.12 --> 494.28]  the opportunity
[494.28 --> 495.36]  for the left hand
[495.36 --> 496.36]  to have absolutely
[496.36 --> 496.88]  no idea
[496.88 --> 497.56]  what the right hand
[497.56 --> 498.70]  is doing is
[498.70 --> 500.16]  well this
[500.16 --> 500.82]  constant
[500.82 --> 502.04]  yeah
[502.04 --> 503.96]  anyway
[503.96 --> 506.18]  I'm glad to hear
[506.18 --> 506.88]  that they are
[506.88 --> 507.74]  doing the right thing
[507.74 --> 508.58]  I fully expected
[508.58 --> 509.64]  them to do the right thing
[509.64 --> 510.70]  we had already
[510.70 --> 511.32]  gotten in touch
[511.32 --> 511.56]  with them
[511.56 --> 512.20]  over a couple
[512.20 --> 513.18]  of customer support
[513.18 --> 513.78]  issues that were
[513.78 --> 514.94]  posted in our sponsor
[514.94 --> 515.98]  it's either
[515.98 --> 517.00]  sponsor concerns
[517.00 --> 518.10]  or sponsor complaints
[518.10 --> 519.28]  thread over on the forum
[519.28 --> 520.56]  that's one of the ways
[520.56 --> 521.60]  that we ensure
[521.60 --> 522.30]  that our community
[522.30 --> 523.16]  is being taken care
[523.16 --> 523.90]  of by our sponsors
[523.90 --> 525.16]  and my understanding
[525.16 --> 526.06]  is at least one
[526.06 --> 526.52]  of those
[526.52 --> 527.42]  was actually
[527.42 --> 528.06]  a complete
[528.06 --> 528.86]  miscommunication
[528.86 --> 529.34]  it was someone
[529.34 --> 530.02]  who was mad
[530.02 --> 530.92]  on behalf
[530.92 --> 531.76]  of someone else
[531.76 --> 532.64]  who already
[532.64 --> 533.30]  had a replacement
[533.30 --> 534.36]  board nearly
[534.36 --> 535.02]  a month ago
[535.02 --> 536.20]  oh wow
[536.20 --> 536.74]  and they were
[536.74 --> 537.56]  but they were mad
[537.56 --> 538.20]  about the way
[538.20 --> 539.12]  Asus handled it
[539.12 --> 540.80]  which is justifiable
[540.80 --> 542.02]  but at a certain point
[542.02 --> 542.82]  you kind of have to ask
[542.82 --> 543.50]  well what do you want
[543.50 --> 544.26]  other than a replacement
[544.26 --> 544.70]  motherboard
[544.70 --> 545.68]  um
[545.68 --> 546.58]  because like stuff's
[546.58 --> 547.10]  gonna break
[547.10 --> 547.82]  stuff happens
[547.82 --> 548.74]  from time to time
[548.74 --> 550.04]  and I can't say
[550.04 --> 551.14]  I can't say I have
[551.14 --> 551.68]  all the details
[551.68 --> 552.16]  of that one
[552.16 --> 553.58]  all I know is
[553.58 --> 554.94]  I sent an email
[554.94 --> 556.64]  uh 10 days ago
[556.64 --> 557.42]  that said
[557.42 --> 559.08]  this needs to go away
[559.08 --> 560.34]  or everything's on pause
[560.34 --> 561.90]  um
[561.90 --> 562.98]  and now I have heard back
[562.98 --> 563.70]  that it is gone
[563.70 --> 564.96]  so that's
[564.96 --> 566.66]  at a certain point
[566.66 --> 567.34]  I can't get into
[567.34 --> 568.40]  the nitty gritty details
[568.40 --> 568.98]  of everything
[568.98 --> 569.50]  yeah
[569.50 --> 570.34]  uh
[570.34 --> 570.82]  anywho
[570.82 --> 572.10]  um
[572.10 --> 572.68]  Asus says
[572.68 --> 573.70]  they have already
[573.70 --> 574.68]  changed the disclaimer
[574.68 --> 575.80]  so it doesn't make it sound
[575.80 --> 576.96]  like updating to the beta bios
[576.96 --> 577.74]  will void your warranty
[577.74 --> 578.60]  uh
[578.60 --> 579.62]  but the change may take
[579.62 --> 580.42]  some time to propagate
[580.42 --> 582.28]  across all of their sites
[582.28 --> 584.86]  complicating matters
[584.86 --> 585.78]  in all of this
[585.78 --> 586.10]  uh
[586.10 --> 586.56]  Gamers Nexus
[586.56 --> 587.56]  tested motherboards
[587.56 --> 588.60]  after the beta update
[588.60 --> 589.32]  and found they were
[589.32 --> 590.42]  still exceeding
[590.42 --> 590.90]  safe voltages
[590.90 --> 591.86]  of 1.4 volts
[591.86 --> 592.88]  so yeah
[592.88 --> 593.48]  that would have been
[593.48 --> 594.20]  a big problem
[594.20 --> 595.34]  if people actually
[595.34 --> 596.56]  weren't getting their boards
[596.56 --> 597.38]  covered under warranty
[597.38 --> 598.92]  but
[598.92 --> 599.50]  the thing is
[599.50 --> 600.10]  realistically
[600.10 --> 601.46]  regardless of the pressure
[601.46 --> 602.08]  from users
[602.08 --> 603.06]  and from media
[603.06 --> 604.50]  this is not the sort of thing
[604.50 --> 605.68]  that AMD would have allowed
[605.68 --> 606.46]  anyway
[606.46 --> 607.14]  uh
[607.14 --> 608.04]  if it was causing
[608.04 --> 609.40]  their chips to die
[609.40 --> 610.14]  it's something that
[610.14 --> 610.62]  they would have been
[610.62 --> 611.40]  working closely
[611.40 --> 611.88]  with Asus
[611.88 --> 612.62]  to remediate
[612.62 --> 613.68]  and ensure
[613.68 --> 614.26]  that their
[614.26 --> 615.08]  collective
[615.08 --> 615.58]  their
[615.58 --> 615.88]  their
[615.88 --> 616.90]  their shared
[616.90 --> 617.44]  customers
[617.44 --> 618.62]  were not going
[618.62 --> 619.72]  to have an extremely
[619.72 --> 620.78]  sour taste in their mouth
[620.78 --> 621.20]  because
[621.20 --> 622.04]  you gotta
[622.04 --> 623.28]  you gotta understand
[623.28 --> 624.52]  that not everyone
[624.52 --> 625.40]  who is going to
[625.40 --> 626.54]  encounter this issue
[626.54 --> 627.78]  is highly technical
[627.78 --> 628.96]  is watching channels
[628.96 --> 629.54]  like LTT
[629.54 --> 630.44]  or Gamers Nexus
[630.44 --> 631.38]  or Jays Two Cents
[631.38 --> 632.10]  or whatever else
[632.10 --> 633.14]  there's people out there
[633.14 --> 634.32]  that buy a motherboard
[634.32 --> 634.90]  the same way
[634.90 --> 635.76]  that I would buy
[635.76 --> 636.68]  man
[636.68 --> 637.12]  what would be
[637.12 --> 637.38]  uh
[637.38 --> 638.36]  what would be a comparison
[638.36 --> 639.20]  uh
[639.20 --> 639.84]  tire
[639.84 --> 640.66]  RC car
[640.66 --> 641.12]  sure
[641.12 --> 641.96]  yeah okay
[641.96 --> 642.18]  sure
[642.18 --> 642.84]  we both went
[642.84 --> 643.80]  with things that roll
[643.80 --> 644.18]  so
[644.18 --> 646.00]  same wavelength
[646.00 --> 647.68]  this is how we work
[647.68 --> 648.68]  ladies and gentlemen
[648.68 --> 650.06]  um
[650.06 --> 650.90]  where
[650.90 --> 652.32]  I know enough
[652.32 --> 653.08]  to know that
[653.08 --> 653.40]  okay
[653.40 --> 654.48]  I need an ESC
[654.48 --> 655.82]  I need a battery
[655.82 --> 656.94]  I need
[656.94 --> 657.68]  either like
[657.68 --> 658.46]  an RTR
[658.46 --> 658.98]  like a
[658.98 --> 659.92]  ready to
[659.92 --> 660.78]  ready to roll
[660.78 --> 661.50]  I think it is
[661.50 --> 662.72]  is what that stands for
[662.72 --> 663.92]  I know I need a transmitter
[663.92 --> 664.88]  or maybe I don't
[664.88 --> 665.34]  if I get one
[665.34 --> 666.02]  that includes one
[666.02 --> 667.26]  like I have some idea
[667.26 --> 667.76]  of everything
[667.76 --> 668.76]  but other than
[668.76 --> 669.36]  you know
[669.36 --> 669.96]  oh yeah
[669.96 --> 670.32]  I think
[670.32 --> 672.06]  Traxxas is like
[672.06 --> 673.32]  pretty good
[673.32 --> 674.40]  but overpriced
[674.40 --> 675.58]  and like
[675.58 --> 677.42]  Arma used to be pretty
[677.42 --> 678.30]  like budget
[678.30 --> 679.24]  friendly
[679.24 --> 680.00]  but like
[680.00 --> 680.44]  then they like
[680.44 --> 681.22]  got bought by someone
[681.22 --> 682.16]  like I kind of know
[682.16 --> 683.18]  a little bit about it
[683.18 --> 683.80]  but not enough
[683.80 --> 684.52]  to make a truly
[684.52 --> 685.26]  informed decision
[685.26 --> 686.50]  a lot of people
[686.50 --> 687.46]  going into this
[687.46 --> 688.80]  would be like that
[688.80 --> 690.40]  and so if all they know
[690.40 --> 690.78]  is
[690.78 --> 691.48]  yeah
[691.48 --> 692.74]  AMD good
[692.74 --> 694.50]  AMD CPU fry
[694.50 --> 696.50]  that reflects really poorly
[696.50 --> 697.64]  on everyone involved
[697.64 --> 698.46]  and it's in everyone's
[698.46 --> 698.96]  best interest
[698.96 --> 699.74]  to get this fixed
[699.74 --> 700.90]  because believe it or not
[700.90 --> 703.02]  nobody likes issuing
[703.02 --> 704.02]  warranty replacements
[704.02 --> 705.20]  and if they can get them
[705.20 --> 705.88]  fixed in the field
[705.88 --> 706.50]  that's absolutely
[706.50 --> 707.58]  what they're going to be doing
[707.58 --> 708.86]  and while
[708.86 --> 709.60]  ASUS has
[709.60 --> 710.60]  absolutely
[710.60 --> 711.88]  been involved
[711.88 --> 712.70]  in some pretty
[712.70 --> 713.72]  frustrating
[713.72 --> 714.90]  warranty drama
[714.90 --> 715.64]  over the years
[715.64 --> 717.04]  I've got to say
[717.04 --> 717.42]  that
[717.42 --> 718.88]  every time
[718.88 --> 720.16]  something's been flagged
[720.16 --> 720.56]  to me
[720.56 --> 722.10]  it's either been
[722.10 --> 722.62]  resolved
[722.62 --> 723.98]  before I got a chance
[723.98 --> 725.16]  to really look into it
[725.16 --> 726.58]  or it's been resolved
[726.58 --> 727.44]  with me sending
[727.44 --> 728.68]  a quiet ping
[728.68 --> 730.70]  and it's
[730.70 --> 731.34]  gone away
[731.34 --> 731.94]  it shouldn't have
[731.94 --> 732.56]  to get to that point
[732.56 --> 733.24]  it should never get
[733.24 --> 733.70]  to that point
[733.70 --> 734.50]  but in some cases
[734.50 --> 735.28]  like I'm trying
[735.28 --> 736.20]  there's always going
[736.20 --> 736.90]  to be something
[736.90 --> 737.96]  the most recent one
[737.96 --> 738.88]  was someone mad
[738.88 --> 739.86]  because they were
[739.86 --> 740.74]  arming a laptop
[740.74 --> 742.32]  and that laptop model
[742.32 --> 743.44]  was no longer produced
[743.44 --> 744.06]  okay
[744.06 --> 745.26]  so they were offered
[745.26 --> 746.62]  a much
[746.62 --> 748.64]  much higher spec laptop
[748.64 --> 749.96]  that had a GPU
[749.96 --> 750.58]  that was like
[750.58 --> 751.48]  wildly faster
[751.48 --> 752.08]  and a CPU
[752.08 --> 752.66]  that was either
[752.66 --> 753.24]  one or two
[753.24 --> 754.10]  generations newer
[754.10 --> 754.68]  okay
[754.68 --> 755.42]  okay
[755.42 --> 756.96]  then ASUS went
[756.96 --> 758.24]  wait sorry
[758.24 --> 759.16]  we actually can't
[759.16 --> 759.90]  get that one either
[759.90 --> 761.04]  but we've got this
[761.04 --> 762.12]  and they were offered
[762.12 --> 762.92]  one that was
[762.92 --> 763.76]  still
[763.76 --> 765.44]  markedly better
[765.44 --> 766.32]  but not as good
[766.32 --> 766.98]  as the first
[766.98 --> 767.04]  AMD
[767.04 --> 768.90]  which I perceived
[768.90 --> 769.46]  as better
[769.46 --> 770.68]  but with a slightly
[770.68 --> 771.52]  lesser GPU
[771.52 --> 772.76]  which
[772.76 --> 773.28]  yeah
[773.28 --> 774.34]  sucks from a gaming
[774.34 --> 774.74]  standpoint
[774.74 --> 775.76]  but is also good
[775.76 --> 776.68]  from a power consumption
[776.68 --> 777.08]  standpoint
[777.08 --> 778.18]  and was still
[778.18 --> 779.02]  way better
[779.02 --> 779.60]  than what they were
[779.60 --> 780.34]  originally offered
[780.34 --> 781.56]  so they were offered
[781.56 --> 781.86]  one
[781.86 --> 782.28]  and then they were
[782.28 --> 782.88]  like oh crap
[782.88 --> 783.42]  no I actually
[783.42 --> 784.14]  don't have that
[784.14 --> 784.88]  but I'll give you
[784.88 --> 785.42]  this one
[785.42 --> 786.32]  that is betterer
[786.32 --> 786.96]  in this way
[786.96 --> 787.80]  and unbetterer
[787.80 --> 788.56]  in this other way
[788.56 --> 789.58]  and they wanted me
[789.58 --> 790.46]  to do a whole expose
[790.46 --> 791.00]  about it
[791.00 --> 791.44]  and they sent me
[791.44 --> 792.00]  a whole thing
[792.00 --> 792.60]  on the forum
[792.60 --> 793.48]  and I'm looking
[793.48 --> 794.06]  at it going
[794.06 --> 795.60]  I would take
[795.60 --> 796.00]  the laptop
[796.00 --> 796.64]  yeah
[796.64 --> 797.60]  I think you should
[797.60 --> 798.22]  take the laptop
[798.22 --> 798.70]  yep
[798.70 --> 800.20]  it's still
[800.20 --> 801.04]  significantly better
[801.04 --> 801.42]  than the one
[801.42 --> 801.86]  that you had
[801.86 --> 802.50]  like I don't know
[802.50 --> 803.04]  and
[803.04 --> 804.02]  but that was
[804.02 --> 804.56]  that was still
[804.56 --> 805.24]  a crappy customer
[805.24 --> 805.78]  experience
[805.78 --> 806.96]  because nobody
[806.96 --> 807.76]  likes to be offered
[807.76 --> 808.18]  something
[808.18 --> 809.02]  and then rug pulled
[809.02 --> 809.56]  right
[809.56 --> 810.36]  if they had something
[810.36 --> 811.10]  that they were happy
[811.10 --> 811.44]  with
[811.44 --> 812.38]  then that sucks
[812.38 --> 813.54]  I mean it's like rug pulled
[813.54 --> 814.26]  but then they like
[814.26 --> 815.36]  also put a really nice
[815.36 --> 816.02]  pillow under you
[816.02 --> 816.64]  before you fall
[816.64 --> 817.78]  well yeah
[817.78 --> 818.74]  it's still better
[818.74 --> 820.10]  than what you were
[820.10 --> 821.70]  better than you had
[821.70 --> 822.36]  which is more
[822.36 --> 823.12]  than I would expect
[823.12 --> 823.60]  honestly
[823.60 --> 824.96]  I think the underlying
[824.96 --> 825.74]  issue here
[825.74 --> 827.34]  is that there's this
[827.34 --> 828.60]  this attitude
[828.60 --> 829.88]  in the IT industry
[829.88 --> 831.38]  that customer service
[831.38 --> 832.30]  after the fact
[832.30 --> 833.64]  is kind of a
[833.64 --> 834.58]  it's an afterthought
[834.58 --> 836.50]  it's not something
[836.50 --> 837.38]  that very many
[837.38 --> 837.84]  companies
[837.84 --> 839.62]  make a core part
[839.62 --> 840.12]  of their brand
[840.12 --> 840.76]  which is why
[840.76 --> 841.70]  it makes me so
[841.70 --> 842.46]  unhappy that
[842.46 --> 843.38]  EVGA pulled out
[843.38 --> 844.08]  of GPUs
[844.08 --> 845.44]  but you can see
[845.44 --> 846.42]  that for them
[846.42 --> 846.92]  to have
[846.92 --> 847.56]  for them to
[847.56 --> 848.08]  maintain
[848.08 --> 849.14]  that level
[849.14 --> 849.56]  of service
[849.56 --> 850.36]  and that reputation
[850.36 --> 851.30]  you need margin
[851.30 --> 852.20]  and there just
[852.20 --> 853.58]  obviously wasn't
[853.58 --> 854.18]  enough margin
[854.18 --> 855.10]  left in GPUs
[855.10 --> 855.48]  for them to
[855.48 --> 856.40]  continue to do that
[856.40 --> 858.34]  all right
[858.34 --> 858.90]  let's get back
[858.90 --> 859.42]  to let's get
[859.42 --> 859.84]  back to
[859.84 --> 860.64]  ASUS
[860.64 --> 861.76]  not being perfect
[861.76 --> 863.34]  for a long
[863.34 --> 864.56]  long
[864.56 --> 865.36]  spell here
[865.36 --> 866.82]  man you guys
[866.82 --> 868.70]  another complication
[868.70 --> 869.82]  ASUS changed
[869.82 --> 870.88]  the CPU support
[870.88 --> 871.62]  table for some
[871.62 --> 872.06]  motherboards
[872.06 --> 872.90]  indicating that
[872.90 --> 874.14]  X3D CPUs
[874.14 --> 874.90]  have only been
[874.90 --> 876.14]  validated since
[876.14 --> 877.58]  the most recent
[877.58 --> 878.36]  non-beta BIOS
[878.36 --> 879.44]  release 1303
[879.44 --> 881.16]  yet the list
[881.16 --> 881.86]  of BIOS updates
[881.86 --> 882.36]  still says
[882.36 --> 883.22]  the older 1202
[883.22 --> 883.64]  releases
[883.64 --> 884.98]  recommended for
[884.98 --> 885.88]  optimum performance
[885.88 --> 887.10]  with X3D processors
[887.10 --> 888.78]  some users
[888.78 --> 889.58]  suggested this was
[889.58 --> 890.78]  done to suggest
[890.78 --> 891.48]  that X3D
[891.48 --> 892.04]  wasn't supported
[892.04 --> 892.80]  on 1202
[892.80 --> 893.76]  according to ASUS
[893.76 --> 894.36]  this was done
[894.36 --> 894.86]  to ensure
[894.86 --> 895.32]  that users
[895.32 --> 896.10]  only download
[896.10 --> 896.82]  the most safe
[896.82 --> 897.44]  BIOS going
[897.44 --> 897.92]  forward
[897.92 --> 901.86]  yeah
[901.86 --> 904.32]  okay
[904.32 --> 905.04]  some more
[905.04 --> 905.40]  takeaways
[905.40 --> 906.02]  yeah we've got
[906.02 --> 906.52]  the thing about
[906.52 --> 907.36]  how they suck
[907.36 --> 907.82]  at PR
[907.82 --> 908.84]  so at least
[908.84 --> 909.20]  they know
[909.20 --> 909.54]  I guess
[909.54 --> 909.98]  that's good
[909.98 --> 911.36]  we asked them
[911.36 --> 911.38]  we asked them
[911.38 --> 911.96]  if they would
[911.96 --> 912.64]  consider putting
[912.64 --> 913.24]  up notices
[913.24 --> 914.36]  slash updates
[914.36 --> 914.98]  on their support
[914.98 --> 915.78]  pages to prevent
[915.78 --> 916.40]  people from getting
[916.40 --> 917.08]  the wrong idea
[917.08 --> 917.98]  they said they
[917.98 --> 918.56]  couldn't comment
[918.56 --> 919.40]  on that and again
[919.40 --> 919.94]  mentioned there
[919.94 --> 920.62]  would be an FAQ
[920.62 --> 921.30]  next week
[921.30 --> 922.74]  and Riley put in
[922.74 --> 923.16]  italics
[923.16 --> 924.20]  just in time
[924.20 --> 924.58]  yeah
[924.58 --> 926.62]  that's the biggest
[926.62 --> 927.46]  thing like if
[927.46 --> 927.80]  they're going to
[927.80 --> 928.62]  comment to you
[928.62 --> 929.94]  oh well like
[929.94 --> 930.60]  people actually
[930.60 --> 931.38]  have this whatever
[931.38 --> 932.14]  that needs to be
[932.14 --> 932.74]  on their site
[932.74 --> 933.24]  you know what
[933.24 --> 933.76]  happened though
[933.76 --> 934.74]  I can probably
[934.74 --> 935.74]  I wasn't on the
[935.74 --> 936.90]  call I don't have
[936.90 --> 937.54]  any kind of
[937.54 --> 938.60]  Riley came in
[938.60 --> 939.68]  asking hey we
[939.68 --> 940.56]  can't get a proper
[940.56 --> 941.18]  response from
[941.18 --> 941.60]  ASUS
[941.60 --> 943.56]  they clearly
[943.56 --> 944.44]  did after
[944.44 --> 944.92]  but he came in
[944.92 --> 945.36]  and talked to me
[945.36 --> 945.80]  he was like hey
[945.80 --> 946.68]  we're having trouble
[946.68 --> 947.18]  getting in touch
[947.18 --> 947.58]  with someone
[947.58 --> 949.12]  do you have
[949.12 --> 949.54]  anyone there
[949.54 --> 950.08]  you can talk to
[950.08 --> 950.34]  I'm like no
[950.34 --> 950.94]  I hired my
[950.94 --> 951.58]  ASUS contact
[951.58 --> 955.38]  no I actually
[955.38 --> 956.38]  don't really know
[956.38 --> 957.22]  anybody there anymore
[957.22 --> 957.88]  but like I mean
[957.88 --> 958.72]  I would be pissed
[958.72 --> 959.78]  like if I was
[959.78 --> 960.58]  an ASUS customer
[960.58 --> 962.20]  and I ran through
[962.20 --> 962.66]  this scenario
[962.66 --> 963.46]  I would be royally
[963.46 --> 963.98]  pissed off
[963.98 --> 964.34]  but you know
[964.34 --> 964.74]  I'll tell you
[964.74 --> 965.20]  what happened
[965.20 --> 966.66]  is the technical
[966.66 --> 967.30]  people know
[967.30 --> 968.12]  exactly what's
[968.12 --> 968.70]  going on
[968.70 --> 969.30]  and are working
[969.30 --> 969.58]  on it
[969.58 --> 971.04]  the PR people
[971.04 --> 971.86]  are sitting there
[971.86 --> 972.90]  trying to understand
[972.90 --> 973.52]  what the technical
[973.52 --> 974.24]  people are telling
[974.24 --> 975.16]  them and then
[975.16 --> 975.92]  the legal department
[975.92 --> 976.62]  is getting in here
[976.62 --> 977.34]  saying whoa
[977.34 --> 977.96]  whoa whoa
[977.96 --> 978.34]  we don't want
[978.34 --> 978.74]  to commit to
[978.74 --> 978.96]  anything
[978.96 --> 979.70]  don't say
[979.70 --> 980.62]  anything
[980.62 --> 982.10]  everything boilerplate
[982.10 --> 983.52]  everything CYA
[983.52 --> 985.22]  and then we
[985.22 --> 985.82]  you know
[985.82 --> 986.76]  we can always
[986.76 --> 988.02]  make exceptions
[988.02 --> 988.66]  case by case
[988.66 --> 988.96]  by case
[988.96 --> 989.26]  by case
[989.26 --> 989.62]  by case
[989.62 --> 990.30]  and do all of
[990.30 --> 990.42]  them
[990.42 --> 991.16]  I don't care
[991.16 --> 991.86]  but don't put
[991.86 --> 992.68]  anything out there
[992.68 --> 993.80]  yeah but they
[993.80 --> 994.66]  already did put
[994.66 --> 995.00]  out there
[995.00 --> 995.42]  that they were
[995.42 --> 995.86]  going to screw
[995.86 --> 996.16]  everyone
[996.16 --> 996.80]  so they got
[996.80 --> 997.50]  to do something
[997.50 --> 998.54]  that's the problem
[998.54 --> 999.58]  at a certain
[999.58 --> 1000.76]  point you have
[1000.76 --> 1001.20]  to tell your
[1001.20 --> 1001.70]  legal team
[1001.70 --> 1002.06]  to kind of
[1002.06 --> 1002.48]  screw off
[1002.48 --> 1002.96]  and just deal
[1002.96 --> 1003.36]  with it
[1003.36 --> 1004.14]  well like
[1004.14 --> 1005.02]  the thing that
[1005.02 --> 1005.78]  happens when you
[1005.78 --> 1006.86]  tell your legal team
[1006.86 --> 1007.76]  to screw off
[1007.76 --> 1008.56]  and deal with it
[1008.56 --> 1009.34]  is that
[1009.34 --> 1009.86]  you end up with
[1009.86 --> 1010.42]  trust me bro
[1010.42 --> 1010.92]  t-shirts
[1010.92 --> 1015.60]  hey
[1015.60 --> 1017.30]  in fairness
[1017.30 --> 1017.92]  to me
[1017.92 --> 1020.12]  okay
[1020.12 --> 1020.76]  did we take
[1020.76 --> 1021.54]  care of everyone
[1021.54 --> 1022.02]  yeah
[1022.02 --> 1022.42]  yeah
[1022.42 --> 1023.14]  were we going
[1023.14 --> 1023.70]  to anyway
[1023.70 --> 1024.76]  yeah
[1024.76 --> 1025.40]  okay trust
[1025.40 --> 1025.78]  me bro
[1025.78 --> 1028.10]  so you're
[1028.10 --> 1028.58]  saying that
[1028.58 --> 1029.12]  they're pulling
[1029.12 --> 1029.70]  a trust me
[1029.70 --> 1029.92]  bro
[1029.92 --> 1030.76]  is that it
[1030.76 --> 1031.86]  uh yeah
[1031.86 --> 1032.74]  but then
[1032.74 --> 1035.68]  but then we're
[1035.68 --> 1036.10]  talking about
[1036.10 --> 1036.90]  bad communication
[1036.90 --> 1037.24]  and all this
[1037.24 --> 1037.58]  other kind of
[1037.58 --> 1037.98]  stuff in the
[1037.98 --> 1038.38]  past
[1038.38 --> 1039.46]  so like it's
[1039.46 --> 1039.96]  i mean
[1039.96 --> 1041.48]  okay then it's
[1041.48 --> 1042.08]  a full trust
[1042.08 --> 1042.46]  me bro
[1042.46 --> 1042.82]  because
[1042.82 --> 1044.24]  that's part
[1044.24 --> 1044.58]  of it
[1044.58 --> 1046.72]  that's a key
[1046.72 --> 1047.28]  element
[1047.28 --> 1048.26]  of the trust
[1048.26 --> 1048.90]  me bro
[1048.90 --> 1050.14]  trifecta
[1050.14 --> 1051.00]  okay you've
[1051.00 --> 1051.34]  got the
[1051.34 --> 1052.12]  overconfidence
[1052.12 --> 1052.86]  in your own
[1052.86 --> 1053.20]  image
[1053.20 --> 1054.04]  you've got
[1054.04 --> 1054.88]  the sort
[1054.88 --> 1055.48]  of appearance
[1055.48 --> 1056.22]  of sketchy
[1056.22 --> 1056.62]  behavior
[1056.62 --> 1057.80]  or maybe
[1057.80 --> 1058.70]  even downright
[1058.70 --> 1059.12]  sketchy
[1059.12 --> 1059.48]  behavior
[1059.48 --> 1060.34]  and then you've
[1060.34 --> 1061.16]  got the uh
[1061.16 --> 1061.54]  what was the
[1061.54 --> 1062.08]  last one
[1062.08 --> 1062.96]  the crappy
[1062.96 --> 1063.64]  communication
[1063.64 --> 1064.22]  yeah yeah
[1064.22 --> 1064.92]  you got all
[1064.92 --> 1065.30]  three
[1065.30 --> 1067.40]  it's perfect
[1067.40 --> 1068.20]  yeah i don't
[1068.20 --> 1068.56]  know you should
[1068.56 --> 1069.22]  license it to
[1069.22 --> 1069.78]  them or something
[1069.78 --> 1071.16]  yeah you know
[1071.16 --> 1072.44]  what you know
[1072.44 --> 1072.80]  what would be
[1072.80 --> 1073.24]  amazing
[1073.24 --> 1074.40]  we can handle
[1074.40 --> 1075.68]  this we create
[1075.68 --> 1077.50]  our own better
[1077.50 --> 1078.38]  business bureau
[1078.38 --> 1080.02]  clone okay but
[1080.02 --> 1082.28]  it's just tmb and
[1082.28 --> 1083.46]  accredited businesses
[1083.46 --> 1084.42]  can display the
[1084.42 --> 1085.58]  trust me bro seal
[1085.58 --> 1086.28]  on their website
[1086.28 --> 1087.08]  oh so it's like
[1087.08 --> 1088.56]  secret shopper and
[1088.56 --> 1089.78]  you get a tmb seal
[1089.78 --> 1090.98]  and you get like a
[1090.98 --> 1092.38]  different like grade
[1092.38 --> 1093.52]  based on how well
[1093.52 --> 1094.24]  you did in secret
[1094.24 --> 1094.70]  shopper
[1094.70 --> 1096.08]  i'm so excited
[1096.08 --> 1098.54]  um now
[1098.54 --> 1100.00]  actually on that
[1100.00 --> 1100.90]  subject oh that
[1100.90 --> 1101.48]  didn't make it into
[1101.48 --> 1102.16]  the notes i had
[1102.16 --> 1102.76]  fired that you know
[1102.76 --> 1103.16]  what it doesn't
[1103.16 --> 1103.72]  matter this is a
[1103.72 --> 1104.44]  very dense topic
[1104.44 --> 1105.98]  um so on that
[1105.98 --> 1107.54]  subject we have our
[1107.54 --> 1109.50]  own ways of holding
[1109.50 --> 1110.62]  folks accountable we
[1110.62 --> 1111.04]  don't review
[1111.04 --> 1111.92]  motherboards right so
[1111.92 --> 1112.60]  it's not the kind of
[1112.60 --> 1113.62]  thing that we deep
[1113.62 --> 1114.78]  dive into day in day
[1114.78 --> 1115.50]  out at least not
[1115.50 --> 1117.14]  now as the lab gets
[1117.14 --> 1117.90]  up and running you
[1117.90 --> 1119.10]  can fully expect to
[1119.10 --> 1120.68]  see more coverage of
[1120.68 --> 1121.68]  things like individual
[1121.68 --> 1122.70]  models of graphics
[1122.70 --> 1124.14]  cards and motherboards
[1124.14 --> 1125.14]  and power supplies and
[1125.14 --> 1126.22]  things like that in
[1126.22 --> 1127.02]  fact we're shooting a
[1127.02 --> 1128.44]  lab update early next
[1128.44 --> 1129.24]  week that is going to
[1129.24 --> 1130.46]  show you guys the
[1130.46 --> 1131.60]  power supply tester is
[1131.60 --> 1132.76]  finally fully configured
[1132.76 --> 1134.04]  we had chroma out here
[1134.04 --> 1136.06]  earlier this week to get
[1136.06 --> 1136.98]  us the training on it
[1136.98 --> 1138.54]  really excited to show
[1138.54 --> 1139.12]  you guys that we're
[1139.12 --> 1139.60]  going to blow up a
[1139.60 --> 1140.16]  power supply it's going
[1140.16 --> 1142.08]  to be awesome um what
[1142.08 --> 1143.26]  was i saying right so
[1143.26 --> 1143.86]  you can expect to see
[1143.86 --> 1144.60]  more of that from us in
[1144.60 --> 1145.58]  the future but that
[1145.58 --> 1146.54]  doesn't mean that we
[1146.54 --> 1147.82]  don't have other things
[1147.82 --> 1148.74]  that are in the works in
[1148.74 --> 1150.58]  order to keep not just
[1150.58 --> 1151.68]  the industry accountable
[1151.68 --> 1152.94]  but actually our sponsors
[1152.94 --> 1154.44]  specifically so i can
[1154.44 --> 1156.26]  finally announce this but
[1156.26 --> 1157.20]  it's been because it's
[1157.20 --> 1158.26]  been in the works for i
[1158.26 --> 1158.86]  think a couple of
[1158.86 --> 1160.86]  months now we are going
[1160.86 --> 1163.22]  to be doing round one of
[1163.22 --> 1165.08]  secret shopping our
[1165.08 --> 1167.34]  sponsors ah we
[1167.34 --> 1169.10]  anonymously so it's done
[1169.10 --> 1170.22]  already right yeah yeah
[1170.22 --> 1170.92]  because we don't talk
[1170.92 --> 1172.06]  about doing it unless it's
[1172.06 --> 1174.44]  done yep always we i
[1174.44 --> 1175.90]  always like to keep my
[1175.90 --> 1177.18]  cards pretty close to my
[1177.18 --> 1178.86]  chest when it comes to
[1178.86 --> 1179.68]  when it comes to
[1179.68 --> 1181.46]  sponsorships but or
[1181.46 --> 1182.52]  excuse me when it comes to
[1182.52 --> 1184.48]  secret shopper um we're
[1184.48 --> 1185.64]  very transparent about
[1185.64 --> 1190.52]  our sponsorships um but
[1190.52 --> 1192.16]  this one has progressed to
[1192.16 --> 1194.52]  the point where we have
[1194.52 --> 1196.50]  collected a lot of
[1196.50 --> 1198.22]  interesting information and
[1198.22 --> 1199.16]  this is going to be one of
[1199.16 --> 1200.58]  the ways that we continue
[1200.58 --> 1201.88]  to evaluate ongoing
[1201.88 --> 1203.28]  sponsor relationships going
[1203.28 --> 1204.48]  forward that's something
[1204.48 --> 1205.18]  we're going to talk about
[1205.18 --> 1206.28]  in more detail once we
[1206.28 --> 1207.04]  actually come up with the
[1207.04 --> 1208.32]  video but we had one of
[1208.32 --> 1209.42]  our probationary employees
[1209.42 --> 1210.50]  who's not listed anywhere
[1210.50 --> 1213.32]  publicly uh just buy
[1213.32 --> 1214.52]  things completely
[1214.52 --> 1216.36]  anonymously and then in
[1216.36 --> 1218.70]  some cases um fabricate
[1218.70 --> 1220.40]  issues so that they could
[1220.40 --> 1221.12]  get in touch with their
[1221.12 --> 1223.08]  support um and just
[1223.08 --> 1224.36]  documented the entire
[1224.36 --> 1225.68]  process i'm really excited
[1225.68 --> 1226.74]  i haven't seen any of the
[1226.74 --> 1228.16]  results in fact i didn't
[1228.16 --> 1229.64]  even pick which sponsors we
[1229.64 --> 1230.44]  were going to do so i
[1230.44 --> 1232.00]  is asus in it i actually
[1232.00 --> 1233.76]  don't know oh man that
[1233.76 --> 1235.14]  would have been really
[1235.14 --> 1237.34]  interesting yeah i mean you
[1237.34 --> 1239.44]  know i wonder um i wonder
[1239.44 --> 1240.60]  if i could find out for you
[1240.60 --> 1242.02]  guys like you know what
[1242.02 --> 1245.42]  no cards to my chest uh
[1245.42 --> 1246.34]  we're we're gonna just
[1246.34 --> 1247.50]  we're gonna blindside
[1247.50 --> 1248.40]  everybody with it one
[1248.40 --> 1250.10]  thing that i'm unsure of
[1250.10 --> 1251.76]  uh right now just reading
[1251.76 --> 1252.88]  this asus topic because i
[1252.88 --> 1254.50]  saw some of it uh but not
[1254.50 --> 1255.86]  a ton up until when i read
[1255.86 --> 1259.20]  the doc in the like private
[1259.20 --> 1260.18]  communication that we
[1260.18 --> 1261.40]  theoretically have they're
[1261.40 --> 1261.96]  talking about how they're
[1261.96 --> 1262.72]  going to deal with it and
[1262.72 --> 1263.36]  everybody's going to be
[1263.36 --> 1265.78]  fine yes what public
[1265.78 --> 1266.70]  communication has there
[1266.70 --> 1269.66]  been at all uh other than
[1269.66 --> 1271.48]  these postings um it
[1271.48 --> 1272.44]  doesn't seem like they
[1272.44 --> 1273.42]  have done a particularly
[1273.42 --> 1274.66]  good job of publicly
[1274.66 --> 1275.84]  communicating as of right
[1275.84 --> 1276.58]  now if someone didn't
[1276.58 --> 1277.50]  watch this they would
[1277.50 --> 1278.30]  still think that their
[1278.30 --> 1279.46]  warranty warranty was
[1279.46 --> 1280.30]  void if they ran the
[1280.30 --> 1282.80]  thing is that correct um
[1282.80 --> 1284.44]  i actually don't know i
[1284.44 --> 1285.60]  think they said that they
[1285.60 --> 1286.98]  are updating the messaging
[1286.98 --> 1288.78]  but it hasn't fully
[1288.78 --> 1291.96]  propagated yet yep or is
[1291.96 --> 1292.94]  that that's just them
[1292.94 --> 1294.54]  removing the the
[1294.54 --> 1297.06]  disclaimer right let me
[1297.06 --> 1297.88]  have a look here hold on
[1297.88 --> 1298.94]  i've actually got a screen
[1298.94 --> 1300.86]  capture to that i can
[1300.86 --> 1301.88]  show you guys here in my
[1301.88 --> 1305.78]  notes except as provided
[1305.78 --> 1307.18]  in the product warranty and
[1307.18 --> 1307.90]  to the maximum extent
[1307.90 --> 1309.08]  permitted by law isus is
[1309.08 --> 1310.26]  not responsible for the
[1310.26 --> 1311.42]  incidental or consequential
[1311.42 --> 1312.28]  damages resulting from
[1312.28 --> 1313.36]  using yeah so this is the
[1313.36 --> 1314.38]  original wording i believe
[1314.38 --> 1315.76]  that original wording is
[1315.76 --> 1317.68]  still there on some pages
[1317.68 --> 1319.58]  and will continue to be until
[1319.58 --> 1321.96]  it actually propagates now
[1321.96 --> 1323.12]  here's the thing it was it
[1323.12 --> 1324.58]  was worded as rollout so
[1324.58 --> 1325.74]  it's actually potential that
[1325.74 --> 1326.70]  those pages haven't even
[1326.70 --> 1327.76]  started now here's the
[1327.76 --> 1329.04]  thing with trust me bro
[1329.04 --> 1331.30]  right remember where i got
[1331.30 --> 1333.38]  into trouble was because i
[1333.38 --> 1335.64]  knew in my head that if
[1335.64 --> 1336.68]  there was ever any kind of
[1336.68 --> 1338.18]  issue we would deal with it
[1338.18 --> 1340.06]  maybe they know in their
[1340.06 --> 1341.34]  heads that if there's ever
[1341.34 --> 1342.74]  any kind of issue they will
[1342.74 --> 1345.02]  deal with it but because of
[1345.02 --> 1347.10]  their somewhat spotty history
[1347.10 --> 1348.20]  with customer service i don't
[1348.20 --> 1348.88]  know if they've actually
[1348.88 --> 1350.90]  earned that for one thing and
[1350.90 --> 1353.36]  for another if they if they
[1353.36 --> 1354.74]  have communicated that
[1354.74 --> 1356.26]  warranty is not going to
[1356.26 --> 1358.88]  cover this unless someone
[1358.88 --> 1361.68]  gets mad and messages
[1361.68 --> 1362.76]  support they might not
[1362.76 --> 1364.30]  realize and they might just
[1364.30 --> 1365.82]  go buy another board thinking
[1365.82 --> 1368.06]  their warranty is invalid and
[1368.06 --> 1371.64]  that would really suck now i
[1371.64 --> 1373.18]  would bet you money that has
[1373.18 --> 1375.26]  already happened now a piece
[1375.26 --> 1377.18]  like probably a bunch now a
[1377.18 --> 1380.80]  piece that i do not know is
[1380.80 --> 1384.42]  how many actual affected
[1384.42 --> 1386.44]  users how many actual cpus have
[1386.44 --> 1388.82]  burned does anyone have any
[1388.82 --> 1391.42]  kind of idea of that anyone
[1391.42 --> 1393.70]  and even if it's here's the
[1393.70 --> 1396.10]  thing even if it's only one or
[1396.10 --> 1398.86]  five or 50 whatever that number
[1398.86 --> 1401.86]  is that doesn't necessarily mean
[1401.86 --> 1402.94]  that everyone's out of the woods
[1402.94 --> 1404.98]  if you've been accidentally
[1404.98 --> 1406.84]  applying a higher than expected
[1406.84 --> 1408.48]  voltage to a cpu some permanent
[1408.48 --> 1410.94]  damage it could cause it it
[1410.94 --> 1413.18]  could cause its lifespan to
[1413.18 --> 1415.26]  decrease in a way that is not
[1415.26 --> 1416.40]  obvious immediately
[1416.40 --> 1422.02]  so this is pretty terribly
[1422.02 --> 1424.06]  handled um yeah we've got some
[1424.06 --> 1424.88]  people that are like really
[1424.88 --> 1426.98]  confused all of processor over
[1426.98 --> 1428.00]  on floatplane says this isn't
[1428.00 --> 1429.16]  how anything works linus there's
[1429.16 --> 1430.54]  no such thing as brand trust
[1430.54 --> 1431.94]  unless you've drank the kool-aid
[1431.94 --> 1434.66]  um there is such a thing as
[1434.66 --> 1436.58]  reputation though like this is
[1436.58 --> 1438.20]  this is the kind of argument that
[1438.20 --> 1440.66]  sort of ended up creating i think a
[1440.66 --> 1444.10]  lot of the negative um sort of
[1444.10 --> 1445.52]  circular arguments that existed
[1445.52 --> 1446.70]  back during the trust me bro
[1446.70 --> 1450.68]  uh controversy is like once we had
[1450.68 --> 1453.42]  the limited lifetime warranty up um
[1453.42 --> 1456.18]  the people who were still mad when
[1456.18 --> 1457.58]  so people would point out hey
[1457.58 --> 1458.72]  they've got their limited lifetime
[1458.72 --> 1460.34]  warranty up everything is fine and
[1460.34 --> 1461.56]  everyone is completely covered
[1461.56 --> 1463.76]  people would say oh oh and by the
[1463.76 --> 1465.78]  way this is like the same as as
[1465.78 --> 1467.64]  these other brands that have a great
[1467.64 --> 1469.28]  reputation for covering their
[1469.28 --> 1471.00]  customers and people would respond
[1471.00 --> 1472.10]  and say yeah but those guys have a
[1472.10 --> 1473.82]  great reputation so you know
[1473.82 --> 1475.94]  obviously like their word is better
[1475.94 --> 1477.62]  and then it's like are you even
[1477.62 --> 1479.18]  listening to yourself because you
[1479.18 --> 1481.90]  can't apply that logic to one and
[1481.90 --> 1485.08]  not to another like i said asus's
[1485.08 --> 1487.72]  reputation is not one that i would
[1487.72 --> 1490.08]  look at and go yeah obviously they're
[1490.08 --> 1491.70]  just 100 going to deal with this
[1491.70 --> 1495.24]  it's not the worst but it isn't that
[1495.24 --> 1496.94]  either but that doesn't mean that no
[1496.94 --> 1499.60]  company can have a reputation for
[1499.60 --> 1501.28]  customer service i mean by that logic
[1501.28 --> 1503.18]  why don't you just buy everything on
[1503.18 --> 1504.88]  from some brand you've never heard of
[1504.88 --> 1508.24]  on aliexpress i wouldn't i would
[1508.24 --> 1510.08]  rather have some idea that i'm
[1510.08 --> 1511.54]  probably going to get taken care of
[1511.54 --> 1515.38]  right apparently i'm supposed to tell
[1515.38 --> 1516.88]  ryan from customer service they're
[1516.88 --> 1519.12]  great okay shout out ryan from
[1519.12 --> 1521.42]  customer service i wouldn't even if i
[1521.42 --> 1524.56]  had so i have never dealt with asus
[1524.56 --> 1526.18]  customer service i've had a bunch of
[1526.18 --> 1527.54]  asus things and none of their stuff
[1527.54 --> 1529.48]  has ever died on me that i didn't
[1529.48 --> 1531.72]  just straight up kill or it was like a
[1531.72 --> 1534.62]  decade old already so that's good but
[1534.62 --> 1535.96]  is not a reflection of the customer
[1535.96 --> 1537.98]  service at all the only customer
[1537.98 --> 1540.52]  service uh that i've really dealt with
[1540.52 --> 1541.86]  in this realm is evga i've told that
[1541.86 --> 1542.92]  story a bunch of times i don't need to
[1542.92 --> 1544.36]  tell it again it was very very good
[1544.36 --> 1546.98]  evga's customer support was the best
[1546.98 --> 1548.30]  customer support i've ever dealt with
[1548.30 --> 1553.26]  in any realm ever um but like if i saw
[1553.26 --> 1554.58]  this i wouldn't believe that they're
[1554.58 --> 1556.12]  going to handle it and if they've had no
[1556.12 --> 1557.22]  communication that they're going to
[1557.22 --> 1559.38]  handle it like yeah i don't know
[1559.38 --> 1564.80]  i'm i'm not willing to necessarily
[1564.80 --> 1567.28]  condemn until we like see what they
[1567.28 --> 1570.90]  actually do but like yeah if i was a
[1570.90 --> 1572.64]  user and this happened to me right now
[1572.64 --> 1575.58]  i would be royally pissed off and i think
[1575.58 --> 1577.52]  i think they have a right to be they're
[1577.52 --> 1578.78]  they're told that they're screwed and
[1578.78 --> 1579.94]  there was no follow-up communication
[1579.94 --> 1582.46]  like that that can't happen this this
[1582.46 --> 1583.84]  has got to be this has got to be
[1583.84 --> 1585.82]  resolved at least during the trust me
[1585.82 --> 1588.44]  bro thing you were saying trust me bro
[1588.44 --> 1591.10]  we're going to handle it they aren't
[1591.10 --> 1592.42]  saying anything as far as my
[1592.42 --> 1594.00]  understanding goes so like what are what
[1594.00 --> 1595.38]  are people supposed to take from this
[1595.38 --> 1598.22]  um like that was the trust me bro thing
[1598.22 --> 1601.02]  there was some form of quote saying that
[1601.02 --> 1602.68]  you're going to be handled the thing
[1602.68 --> 1604.34]  wasn't done they wanted a warranty that
[1604.34 --> 1605.64]  type of stuff wasn't handled yet but
[1605.64 --> 1606.84]  you're like it's coming we're figuring
[1606.84 --> 1609.22]  it out trust me this one there is none
[1609.22 --> 1612.48]  of that i'm not saying that that is if
[1612.48 --> 1615.32]  they come out and just go like lol tmb we
[1615.32 --> 1617.52]  licensed it from linus whatever i'm not
[1617.52 --> 1620.62]  saying that that would like be good but
[1620.62 --> 1622.30]  like they're not even at least doing
[1622.30 --> 1623.94]  that you know what i mean like i i don't
[1623.94 --> 1626.24]  know this is this is rough this is very
[1626.24 --> 1628.62]  rough yeah i mean i do think they
[1628.62 --> 1630.32]  deserve some heat for this yeah they do
[1630.32 --> 1632.08]  the problem for me is i don't like
[1632.08 --> 1634.42]  getting dragged into their drama and i'm
[1634.42 --> 1635.68]  looking at it this morning i'm reading
[1635.68 --> 1637.50]  i'm reading comments on the video from
[1637.50 --> 1638.70]  yesterday why is the line is talking
[1638.70 --> 1639.78]  and i'm looking i'm looking at this
[1639.78 --> 1643.92]  going like holy you guys how have you
[1643.92 --> 1646.90]  not dealt with this make this go away
[1646.90 --> 1648.46]  yeah what what what do you what do you
[1648.46 --> 1650.72]  have to send out what a motherboard 10
[1650.72 --> 1654.50]  motherboards 100 but i don't care put
[1654.50 --> 1657.62]  them in the mail what's wrong with you
[1657.62 --> 1660.12]  yeah yeah yeah yeah and we hadn't we
[1660.12 --> 1661.86]  had there wasn't even enough time for
[1661.86 --> 1663.72]  us to have a wan show yet yeah and we
[1663.72 --> 1665.38]  don't cover motherboards so everyone
[1665.38 --> 1668.12]  needs to relax when it comes to us um
[1668.12 --> 1669.48]  there's much people saying that we're
[1669.48 --> 1671.38]  like covering asus's butt so i just
[1671.38 --> 1672.96]  wanted to be clear that we're not we
[1672.96 --> 1675.20]  don't think that they did a good job and
[1675.20 --> 1677.10]  i specifically said i don't think
[1677.10 --> 1679.74]  they've earned a trust me bro guarantee
[1679.74 --> 1683.42]  yes so if it wasn't clear hopefully it
[1683.42 --> 1686.92]  is now clear yeah hope hopefully basically
[1686.92 --> 1688.98]  the only the only thing that i think
[1688.98 --> 1691.20]  people could look at from what we talked
[1691.20 --> 1692.56]  about and say you know well that sounds
[1692.56 --> 1694.46]  like butt covering is when i mentioned
[1694.46 --> 1696.58]  that i don't think that amd would be very
[1696.58 --> 1698.36]  happy with this situation if it was
[1698.36 --> 1700.80]  actually killing their chips but really
[1700.80 --> 1704.58]  that having having been on the other
[1704.58 --> 1709.14]  side there are absolutely fires and there
[1709.14 --> 1710.78]  are people working on putting out those
[1710.78 --> 1714.02]  fires and you are not privy to a lot of
[1714.02 --> 1715.88]  it that's just that's just not how this
[1715.88 --> 1718.22]  works not everyone at a company is
[1718.22 --> 1720.38]  authorized to speak publicly sometimes
[1720.38 --> 1722.02]  the people who are authorized to speak
[1722.02 --> 1725.24]  publicly probably shouldn't this stuff
[1725.24 --> 1727.88]  is very real and definitely happens and
[1727.88 --> 1729.82]  i'm sure that they were dealing with
[1729.82 --> 1733.12]  this um they clearly did an extraordinarily
[1733.12 --> 1736.52]  poor job but no i'm not in a position
[1736.52 --> 1738.20]  where i'm never gonna work with them
[1738.20 --> 1740.50]  again or anything like that because from
[1740.50 --> 1742.76]  my point of view it's much more effective
[1742.76 --> 1745.16]  for me to just say if you don't deal
[1745.16 --> 1746.78]  with this i will never work with you
[1746.78 --> 1749.64]  again and then they will deal with it
[1749.64 --> 1751.02]  and then we will continue to work with
[1751.02 --> 1754.38]  them i mean that's that's my style of
[1754.38 --> 1757.96]  leverage so you know i guess it's i guess
[1757.96 --> 1759.54]  it's not really that different from jay's
[1759.54 --> 1761.38]  like if we if we look at if we look at a
[1761.38 --> 1763.04]  sponsor relationship like a romantic
[1763.04 --> 1765.90]  relationship you know i'm basically saying
[1765.90 --> 1768.36]  privately i'm withholding sex until you
[1768.36 --> 1770.40]  change your behavior and then jay is
[1770.40 --> 1772.90]  posting on facebook i'm withholding sex
[1772.90 --> 1773.64]  from my spouse
[1773.64 --> 1777.36]  so that's that's what we do
[1777.36 --> 1783.16]  oh man um so what we did with uh yufy is
[1783.16 --> 1785.70]  i'm i'm never giving you this ever again
[1785.70 --> 1789.54]  yeah and what we did that one publicly
[1789.54 --> 1792.42]  well that's different though that's
[1792.42 --> 1795.24]  different that was that was users private
[1795.24 --> 1798.16]  video data that's and and they continued
[1798.16 --> 1800.64]  to systematically lie about it over time
[1800.64 --> 1802.14]  okay so i'm not equating the two
[1802.14 --> 1803.88]  situations i'm just saying our response
[1803.88 --> 1806.08]  to it wasn't i'm withholding temporarily
[1806.08 --> 1810.22]  it was like we done i want to pull a pull
[1810.22 --> 1813.12]  yeah i want to i want to hear what people
[1813.12 --> 1815.02]  how people would rate asus's customer
[1815.02 --> 1818.92]  service uh out of five so five options
[1818.92 --> 1821.30]  yeah i would do like i would do like one
[1821.30 --> 1824.28]  to five and then like na or something like
[1824.28 --> 1825.84]  that uh i want to hear from the float
[1825.84 --> 1827.46]  plane audience because i've got aj tech
[1827.46 --> 1829.70]  saying uh it's a long block of text i'm not
[1829.70 --> 1830.88]  going to read the whole thing but basically
[1830.88 --> 1833.50]  that they were pretty happy um
[1833.50 --> 1837.54]  yeah no one else is really no one else is
[1837.54 --> 1838.86]  really talking about it yet but
[1838.86 --> 1842.10]  ma'am the reality of it is i've had
[1842.10 --> 1845.58]  really i've had really awful experiences
[1845.58 --> 1849.90]  with most of the taiwanese tech companies
[1849.90 --> 1853.18]  at some point or another um and a lot of
[1853.18 --> 1855.88]  that was not obviously as a tech reviewer
[1855.88 --> 1857.52]  where you know i get the white glove
[1857.52 --> 1860.56]  treatment right a lot of that is when i was
[1860.56 --> 1863.68]  working at ncix and seeing the kind of the
[1863.68 --> 1864.86]  way that they would treat their partners
[1864.86 --> 1868.00]  right because have you guys ever ever heard
[1868.00 --> 1871.92]  the the saying um a man who is kind to you
[1871.92 --> 1875.78]  and uh rude to a waiter is not a kind man
[1875.78 --> 1879.18]  yeah um i like that one yeah that is
[1879.18 --> 1881.98]  those are those are words to live by
[1881.98 --> 1885.60]  right there um and seeing the way that a
[1885.60 --> 1889.32]  company treats their partners um is is one
[1889.32 --> 1892.68]  of the ways that i evaluate the integrity
[1892.68 --> 1894.88]  of a company and
[1894.88 --> 1901.52]  the number of times the way that most
[1901.52 --> 1905.14]  computer hardware manufacturers will go
[1905.14 --> 1908.24]  will will go to any lengths to try to deny
[1908.24 --> 1910.70]  a warranty claim is frankly kind of gross
[1910.70 --> 1915.92]  it sucks there are some standout non like
[1915.92 --> 1918.54]  that behaviors behaviors there are some
[1918.54 --> 1920.58]  standout companies that don't behave like
[1920.58 --> 1923.98]  that ones that come to mind evga although
[1923.98 --> 1925.62]  they were much more challenging to deal
[1925.62 --> 1927.44]  with as a retailer than as a consumer i will
[1927.44 --> 1930.84]  tell you guys that much uh corsair corsair
[1930.84 --> 1933.90]  basically had a blanket policy with us put
[1933.90 --> 1936.94]  it on a pallet send it back to us um my
[1936.94 --> 1940.10]  understand i've heard just small rumblings
[1940.10 --> 1942.68]  it started very small i've heard rumblings
[1942.68 --> 1944.30]  that it might not be that easy with them
[1944.30 --> 1947.86]  anymore but overall they've had a really pro
[1947.86 --> 1951.74]  consumer approach to um to taking care of
[1951.74 --> 1954.08]  warranty issues and support issues in during
[1954.08 --> 1955.48]  the time that i've worked with them which is a
[1955.48 --> 1960.40]  long time uh logitech logitech has basically a
[1960.40 --> 1962.08]  legendary reputation when it comes to
[1962.08 --> 1964.94]  replacements my understanding again is more
[1964.94 --> 1967.10]  recently they've had some quality issues and
[1967.10 --> 1969.74]  people have had to do more rmas but they've
[1969.74 --> 1971.28]  still been really good about communication
[1971.28 --> 1973.60]  getting stuff back to you are there any that
[1973.60 --> 1976.16]  that you know of that just have spotless reputations
[1976.16 --> 1979.70]  knock to uh yeah knock to us one float plane chat
[1979.70 --> 1982.60]  yeah 100 i would only want to speak from my own
[1982.60 --> 1985.44]  experience yeah for sure and it's just evga that
[1985.44 --> 1989.84]  evga call was one of the like most insane things i've
[1989.84 --> 1992.42]  like that level of customer support was so insanely
[1992.42 --> 1994.98]  above and beyond i just i don't know i will
[1994.98 --> 1998.20]  always be friendly towards their customer support
[1998.20 --> 2000.66]  unless it's like drastically changed which from
[2000.66 --> 2004.08]  what i've heard from the community it hasn't
[2004.08 --> 2006.16]  everyone every time i talk about evga customer
[2006.16 --> 2007.60]  support everybody's like yeah they're they're
[2007.60 --> 2010.48]  great so like sounds good to me
[2010.48 --> 2017.28]  yeah a lot of really good feedback for the i
[2017.28 --> 2019.36]  mean the ones i mentioned mostly i'm kind of
[2019.36 --> 2022.32]  looking for other ones uh some good feedback for
[2022.32 --> 2024.80]  hyper x okay that's good to know we haven't
[2024.80 --> 2026.70]  actually worked with hyper x in a long time we
[2026.70 --> 2028.80]  used to all the time yeah yeah i wonder if brian's
[2028.80 --> 2031.36]  still there should email him be like hey are you
[2031.36 --> 2033.80]  like tired of sponsoring esports teams maybe we
[2033.80 --> 2037.32]  want to come back to like tech media that was
[2037.32 --> 2039.16]  basically the whole thing like we were we're
[2039.16 --> 2041.64]  still chill um but they were just like yeah we're
[2041.64 --> 2043.48]  like spending all our money on esports esports teams
[2043.48 --> 2046.68]  now okay fair enough don't think it went super
[2046.68 --> 2051.80]  well um so almost everybody 70 are saying
[2051.80 --> 2056.84]  na or never dealt with um then it goes seven percent
[2056.84 --> 2061.40]  did like one as in low i've got it up now okay yeah you
[2061.40 --> 2064.12]  can see it yeah the majority of it's never dealt
[2064.12 --> 2066.92]  with and then it's like pretty even distribution except
[2066.92 --> 2070.44]  for five very few people said it was like five like
[2070.44 --> 2072.68]  outstanding yeah very very few the rest of it is
[2072.68 --> 2075.24]  pretty even all the way through i think this needs to be a big
[2075.24 --> 2079.88]  wake-up call for them that's yeah that's not great i
[2079.88 --> 2082.92]  wonder i wonder oh no i don't actually want to pit them
[2082.92 --> 2086.44]  against each other but like i bet you there's a few customers we
[2086.44 --> 2089.64]  could or a few companies we could throw in there with the exact same poll that
[2089.64 --> 2093.88]  would score a lot better yeah i mean i think if we threw like a
[2093.88 --> 2097.96]  logitech or any vga in there they'd probably score a lot better but
[2097.96 --> 2101.56]  here's an interesting one this and this is something that's frustrated me for
[2101.56 --> 2104.60]  years and in fact i think i've even talked about on wanshow
[2104.60 --> 2107.64]  if i put any other motherboard manufacturer in there
[2107.64 --> 2110.92]  would the story be any different no that's interesting that's actually very
[2110.92 --> 2116.92]  interesting yeah yeah literally universally
[2116.92 --> 2124.28]  i've had and seen anecdotally very mediocre at best experiences with
[2124.28 --> 2127.40]  literally all of them
[2127.88 --> 2131.64]  and i can see some of the factors that might contribute to that
[2131.64 --> 2136.36]  they have so many skews sometimes with very little variation but
[2136.36 --> 2139.72]  so many skews across all these different regions they are
[2139.72 --> 2145.40]  actually very complicated products yes and they deal with a lot of users
[2145.40 --> 2149.80]  that are not necessarily particularly experienced so the volume of support
[2149.80 --> 2158.12]  genuinely poke at or prod or crank things on motherboards all the time
[2158.20 --> 2162.92]  yeah that's tough i wonder if needing to unscrew things and screw things back in
[2162.92 --> 2165.80]  for m.2 drives has increased failure rates
[2165.80 --> 2170.44]  that's a good question it wouldn't surprise me i could see people cranking an
[2170.44 --> 2173.64]  m.2 too tight yeah the thing is that wouldn't go back to the motherboard
[2173.64 --> 2177.08]  maker that would probably go back to the ssd manufacturer though
[2177.08 --> 2180.28]  they'd be sitting there going like why is it that every time someone
[2180.28 --> 2185.00]  installs well no because every board was using metal screws for the longest time
[2185.00 --> 2187.88]  yeah this is tough
[2188.60 --> 2195.24]  yeah flow plane chat now lighting up with people just saying yeah i had you know
[2195.24 --> 2199.00]  the one positive one oh this is great i'm victor says haven't seen any complaints
[2199.00 --> 2205.88]  about ecs or foxconn motherboards in a while yeah i get it haven't seen an ecs or a foxconn
[2205.88 --> 2213.80]  motherboard in a while let me let me let me tell you though when they were around they were not
[2213.80 --> 2225.88]  perfect oh man um yeah so tough situation but here's what i will here's my final here's my final
[2225.88 --> 2231.32]  word on the subject asus in good faith we still want to continue to work with you
[2232.52 --> 2238.84]  we need to see you improve this here yeah this is this is rough yeah fix you know what's not rough
[2238.84 --> 2241.32]  if you guys want to interact with the show you know what the way to do it is
[2242.12 --> 2247.00]  leave a merch message just like down here you don't want to send a super chat you don't want to send
[2247.00 --> 2252.60]  twitch bits why are you just throwing money at the screen when you could be throwing money at sick new
[2252.60 --> 2258.20]  merch from lttstore.com to send a merch message all you got to do is fill up that cart head to the
[2258.20 --> 2264.20]  checkout and you're going to see a box called merch messages um i mean you should put some text in the
[2264.20 --> 2270.44]  box that would be a good idea when you do you'll get a little shout out down here uh you might get a
[2270.44 --> 2276.12]  response from producer dan you might get a response from someone else after is that workflow implemented
[2276.12 --> 2281.72]  yeah that flow is implemented apparently yeah we can create a support ticket directly and support will
[2281.72 --> 2286.52]  get back to you sick okay so it's possible if we can't answer your question or your questions like
[2286.52 --> 2292.20]  about an order or something like that that especially has to do with the ltd store support
[2292.20 --> 2296.28]  we can forward that on to them and they can deal with it next week when they come into the office
[2296.28 --> 2301.24]  which is cool because instead of just giving you like a garbage like i don't know sorry we can
[2301.24 --> 2307.56]  actually get some some action on it wow shots fired what you called dan's i don't know sorry
[2307.56 --> 2313.80]  response is garbage oh yeah i mean i've done them too if we can't do better can't like appropriately
[2313.80 --> 2318.04]  address your problem then it's it's not good so now we can appropriately address your problem which is
[2318.04 --> 2323.80]  good the final option is that if you send something particularly interesting that we have never covered
[2323.80 --> 2329.64]  before then we might address it later on the show in when show after dark now you're probably wondering
[2329.64 --> 2336.92]  lttstore.com what could they possibly carry that i would be interested in and let me tell you
[2336.92 --> 2342.44]  let me show you the ways i'm so excited because we haven't really hyped this up that much
[2342.44 --> 2348.36]  in the lead up to our launch this has been relatively quiet but they're finally here producer dan do you
[2348.36 --> 2358.68]  want to man the camera oh boy okay stick locks they're finally here silicone joystick covers
[2361.96 --> 2370.76]  cool there you go are they universal uh yes wow stick locks are designed to reduce the horizontal
[2370.76 --> 2376.84]  force applied to your joysticks when traveling with a controller or console they are small convenient
[2376.84 --> 2385.16]  and can be installed and removed in seconds we spent a ton of time on the geometry for these getting
[2385.16 --> 2392.04]  it absolutely nailed so that it fits on everything from the nintendo switch all the way to the steam deck
[2392.04 --> 2401.24]  and full-sized desktop class controllers it's super flexible but hard enough that it's not going to kind of
[2401.24 --> 2408.92]  pull on things when you are uh you know sliding a controller or sliding a console in or out of your bag
[2408.92 --> 2416.76]  i am so so excited to launch these um and luke have you ever touched them have you touched sticks
[2416.76 --> 2419.88]  locks yet okay cool here is a box of stick locks
[2422.04 --> 2425.16]  here is a nintendo switch steam deck
[2425.16 --> 2436.84]  nintendo pro controller xbox controller dual sense okay pick i don't know two or three i don't care
[2436.84 --> 2441.64]  pick however many you want and let's get you to install some stick locks all right okay now you guys
[2441.64 --> 2446.60]  i'm gonna brief you once just at the very beginning dan is not going to try to follow luke around
[2447.24 --> 2453.32]  he's just gonna aim there luke keep the thing there oops that's not what i meant to click okay there we
[2453.32 --> 2459.08]  go i like that it's cheeky it's good you might have to read it for the people you look really smart but
[2459.08 --> 2464.28]  here's an installation guide if you need it cool and then it shows all the things it's like compatible
[2464.28 --> 2468.36]  with i guess playstation 2 controller playstation dual shock 3 controller playstation dual shock 4
[2468.36 --> 2472.12]  controller playstation dual sense controller xbox controller nintendo gamecube controller
[2472.12 --> 2476.84]  and then valve steam deck nintendo switch and nintendo switch pro controller now there is one
[2476.84 --> 2483.00]  asterisk there the uh playstation 2 controller we actually found is a little bit more hit or miss
[2483.00 --> 2490.84]  so the site has been updated um in advance of the launch but you'll have seen the site before you see
[2490.84 --> 2496.76]  the packaging so i think it's fine okay let's see if you can handle it these are going to end up being
[2496.76 --> 2503.08]  fidget toys i know they're fun just making sure you guys are aware i would recommend you know what
[2503.08 --> 2508.68]  i'm gonna let you try and figure it out because this is no offense this is a an average user here that
[2508.68 --> 2520.52]  i'm wow okay hold that up for the hold that up for the camera oh geez like i said you can see it on here
[2520.52 --> 2527.24]  and i can like do that put more pressure on it come on it's a stick lock that's the whole point
[2528.28 --> 2532.60]  and it oh that's kind of cool so if i do get it to move by putting like up you can see my finger i'm
[2532.60 --> 2536.84]  putting quite a bit of pressure on there it goes back cool right kind of pushes itself back a little
[2536.84 --> 2542.28]  bit yeah that's sweet yeah is this how you're supposed to do it no not really
[2542.28 --> 2553.00]  i mean it is a two-hand operation there's gotta that that is a thing like we really did
[2554.28 --> 2558.84]  oh we really did try to make it something that you could one hand it did end up being a two-hand
[2558.84 --> 2563.16]  thing i personally find that the fastest way i'm just going to come back out to the wide cam for a
[2563.16 --> 2567.16]  second here you just squish it over top i've got my own pack of stick without inverting so the way
[2567.16 --> 2572.04]  that the way that i like to do it here i'll take it yeah sure is oh where somewhere that you guys
[2572.04 --> 2577.40]  can actually see uh oh good good gravy well okay the way that i like to do it is i do the two thumb
[2577.40 --> 2581.96]  method put it on the stick this is really hard to do while i'm also hosting and then i put it on like
[2581.96 --> 2587.48]  that so i'll get the two thumbs in there to kind of spread it open and then get it over the uh
[2588.76 --> 2596.60]  really what's wrong with you i'll get it over the joystick uh why don't you actually instead of
[2596.60 --> 2602.28]  doing the steam deck which is basically like the same as the oh oh actually yeah leave those
[2602.28 --> 2607.56]  installed leave those installed this is really good so here's the uh nintendo switch pro controller
[2607.56 --> 2614.20]  okay see if you can do the switch this no no the switch yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay let's get
[2614.20 --> 2628.04]  it okay finding something that was possible to install on everything from low profile to full-sized
[2628.04 --> 2634.12]  joysticks was really challenging this is one of those prod products that we conceived a very very
[2634.12 --> 2641.80]  very very very very very very long time ago and then took forever to actually get right but we're really
[2641.80 --> 2646.04]  really proud of the result so it is a little bit more challenging to get onto the switch but it
[2646.04 --> 2653.00]  totally goes on there i thought it easier really all right well those were both like instant the
[2653.00 --> 2657.48]  first way i was doing it was also like really bad i don't think i'm doing it the same way you do because
[2657.48 --> 2661.80]  i couldn't see your demonstration but the the new i'm doing it is way better you're also more practiced
[2661.80 --> 2667.32]  at it now so that's probably a factor too yeah so do you want to just show okay the last thing i want
[2667.32 --> 2674.36]  to show is how it sits uh more proud on the steam deck compared to on the switch controller there you
[2674.36 --> 2681.40]  go so you can see how the way the geometry is designed it can flatten out more or it can stand
[2681.40 --> 2686.84]  more tent-like and either way it prevents the stick from moving do you want to just give the give the
[2686.84 --> 2692.84]  sticks a little wiggle or try you can try yeah i move i'm moving the whole that's clearly in place
[2692.84 --> 2697.80]  and then this one is also in place it is slick too i was doing this earlier oh i pulled that one off
[2697.80 --> 2702.84]  but it is bob that make sure it was on there i don't want if it's bad we got to pull it we got to
[2702.84 --> 2711.08]  pull the product mr i found it so much easier to put on the switch it is a little okay i find it a
[2711.08 --> 2716.60]  little more challenging to put on the switch personally i thought i had it it might have been how i pushed at
[2716.60 --> 2721.88]  it there we go but yeah they're slick so like you were mentioning you put it in your bag and it
[2721.88 --> 2726.60]  should actually be fine because it'll slide along materials especially if you have an ltd bag that
[2726.60 --> 2731.32]  has like the the like i don't know what it is but the like soft touch material yeah it'll slide right
[2731.32 --> 2737.08]  along screen safe material i think we call it on the product page yeah yeah i'm so excited so stick
[2737.08 --> 2743.64]  locks are finally here we're absolutely jazzed for them some got some really great questions uh i had
[2743.64 --> 2750.12]  someone asking hey does this help with stick drift you know what unfortunately it's not something
[2750.12 --> 2757.40]  that we can scientifically test with the equipment that we have today uh but what we do know is that
[2758.92 --> 2763.72]  if something is moving around in your bag or getting caught on anything that is probably not
[2763.72 --> 2769.24]  good for it and we know that people have been looking for a way to keep their sticks in place
[2769.24 --> 2774.92]  whether it's a case whether it's some kind of lock and now there is a thing people ask for removal
[2774.92 --> 2777.96]  the way i would do it i don't know if you're supposed to but i would like brace it on
[2777.96 --> 2783.16]  one side to luke's camera and just hold it up yeah we don't need dan to go back brace it on one
[2783.16 --> 2789.08]  side and then peel up the opposite side is that what you would do no i actually two-handed again
[2789.08 --> 2796.04]  so going back to the wide uh so i would typically just put my thumb in the middle uh hold on just a
[2796.04 --> 2801.00]  second wow it's actually really hard to get off this oh no there we go so what i right right right
[2801.00 --> 2806.52]  right right what i would typically do is get under it like this to get under one of the legs yeah and
[2806.52 --> 2811.40]  then put my finger on the joystick down yeah straight down and then pull it up so that way you can get
[2811.40 --> 2816.44]  it off without moving the stick around and putting a ton of pressure on it yeah so i will typically go
[2816.44 --> 2821.72]  thumbs to invert it stick it on like that get under one of the legs press it down in the middle and pull
[2821.72 --> 2828.76]  it off like that good to go freaking excited cool yeah these took a long time oh yeah 14.99 and that
[2828.76 --> 2834.76]  comes uh that gives you a pack of four uh hey dan could i trouble you i forgot water oh no yeah
[2834.76 --> 2839.40]  absolutely i need some water you can pick your own merch messages to read oh okay where's oh we're
[2839.40 --> 2843.96]  supposed to do uh three merch messages i'll read two we're supposed to do two merch messages
[2845.24 --> 2848.04]  i gotta scroll all the way down to the curateds
[2850.20 --> 2856.28]  okay i use the wan desk pad at my repair shop counter and i'm always getting asked where can i get one
[2856.28 --> 2862.76]  have you considered slash would you sell to small businesses for retail release this is from robert
[2862.76 --> 2871.08]  h i mean yeah no one's ever asked like you'd be you would be oh i shouldn't even say no one's ever
[2871.08 --> 2877.80]  asked i mean we've tried with some of our products um like i i joked in that micro center sponsored
[2877.80 --> 2883.88]  video when we were down there fixing xqc's computer i was i was joking with the rep i was like why don't you
[2883.88 --> 2887.88]  guys carry the ltt screwdriver because we we've actually like we've reached out to them we've been
[2887.88 --> 2892.44]  like hey you guys should carry the ltt screwdriver and they're i i don't know what exactly is going
[2892.44 --> 2897.88]  on i don't know if they're just dragging butt or whatever else but nothing's ever happened seems like
[2897.88 --> 2903.72]  a good idea i know that we've reached out to more than one retailer about carrying the abcs of gaming
[2903.72 --> 2911.48]  and just hasn't really worked out i i don't know it's confusing to me sure let me know slide into
[2911.48 --> 2919.88]  my dms uh i mean obviously i think it's going to be i think there's going to be some challenges for
[2919.88 --> 2926.04]  extremely small resellers like if you're asking can you can you order two mouse pads that's that's
[2926.04 --> 2934.12]  honestly not much higher order volume than a user um so i could i could see us having some kind of
[2934.12 --> 2939.64]  like minimum order quantity or something to set i guess we don't really have any infrastructure for
[2939.64 --> 2947.96]  reseller accounts no well we're working on we're working on quantity discounts right for the um for the bit selector
[2947.96 --> 2955.40]  uh yep so maybe we could reuse some of that just baked into the normal store though is that normal is
[2955.40 --> 2960.84]  that i don't think that's well some stores do like my master car has that yeah it's a very industrial
[2962.20 --> 2968.44]  thing though it's it that's like an industrial thing that happens to also sell to individuals
[2969.00 --> 2974.60]  you can do the whole thing should just send it whole bottle no would you like another
[2974.60 --> 2982.76]  yeah if only we sold if only we sold larger water bottles i carry my 64 ounce literally everywhere
[2982.76 --> 2991.88]  um but anyways yeah i don't know yeah one more please one more oh i meant more water but yeah sure
[2991.88 --> 2997.88]  uh let's see which one did you read let's pick just one random uh what challenges have the floatplane
[2997.88 --> 3005.96]  dev team overcome this week this week this week how about what challenges have they overcome today
[3007.08 --> 3013.00]  that's a shorter list yeah but still probably too long for wan show we're back to six hour wan show
[3013.00 --> 3020.44]  yeah i could i could i could send it um yeah so i think this week was largely we got all of the features
[3020.44 --> 3027.48]  that we want to have uh on the beta site on to the beta site last week um so now we're going through
[3027.48 --> 3033.48]  and doing like cleanup um so there was bug fixes to have to have there was there was a couple hot
[3033.48 --> 3039.56]  fixes that were pushed this week um there was also some some things pushed from from jaden and another
[3039.56 --> 3044.28]  person that i haven't actually asked if he's cool with me saying his name on stream yet so i will not
[3044.28 --> 3049.64]  say his name but from another person uh kind of cleaning up some of the payments upgrade downgrade
[3049.64 --> 3055.08]  stuff that we pushed last week um so it's a it's a little bit more bug free now there are still some
[3055.08 --> 3060.04]  problems with it um including some of the logic for upgrading and downgrading which we're going to
[3060.04 --> 3067.56]  be changing a little bit um and increasing transparency the user on on when and why and how
[3067.56 --> 3075.16]  they can or cannot do that um just because we don't want any confusion there we want it to be very obvious
[3075.16 --> 3082.68]  what limitations there are uh so some changes there but once those changes are done uh we're basically done
[3082.68 --> 3088.44]  done with that big push so the beta will stop being a beta and it will just be the main site
[3088.44 --> 3094.84]  the the original aim for that was was this week but then there was some additional work that i wanted
[3094.84 --> 3102.12]  to get done in relation to payment upgrade downgrade um so we're going to finish those off and then and
[3102.12 --> 3110.20]  then we'll try to send it but yeah okay let's uh let's see if we can knock out a couple rapid fires here we
[3110.20 --> 3116.76]  got a about a minute left or so in this segment um let's see uh oh this is going to be a spicy one
[3116.76 --> 3121.80]  if asus doesn't fix things to satisfaction does pulling sponsorship deals include the ltx 2023
[3121.80 --> 3127.80]  headline sponsorship yeah of course i've already talked to colton about it got him yeah rapid fire
[3127.80 --> 3133.08]  you guys are getting better at this uh let's see hey lld for linus wondering if basketball shorts are
[3133.08 --> 3137.96]  a thing actually you know what no i'm not done talking about that oh crap yeah okay
[3139.64 --> 3143.08]  long show long praise rescinded
[3149.32 --> 3153.64]  what have i what have i ever done in the past to make people doubt that
[3156.76 --> 3162.12]  for real though you do have to wonder like you don't necessarily know how long this person has been
[3162.12 --> 3168.84]  watching i guess how much they've they've they've viewed this could be a new viewer yeah i guess
[3168.84 --> 3174.12]  they might just be someone who doesn't watch wan so so it doesn't go flat the country if you don't
[3174.12 --> 3180.92]  watch wan show and you don't go on reddit nothing really happens yeah probably fine we do we do keep
[3180.92 --> 3188.52]  the the mainline content pretty clean evergreen is is is the word that we try not to we try not to
[3188.52 --> 3196.76]  have too many you know wink winks current controversy haha because we want our videos to be still right
[3196.76 --> 3202.28]  even if the part numbers of everything involved aren't that relevant we want the learning outcomes
[3202.28 --> 3207.96]  and we want the overall vibe to be just as fun two years three years five years down the road as they are
[3207.96 --> 3213.96]  the day that they're released um so yeah we do tend to keep current events out of them to a degree anyway
[3213.96 --> 3221.96]  um and so yeah okay i guess you're right but we have we have publicly dunked on our sponsors over and
[3221.96 --> 3230.44]  over and over and over again and we have publicly broken up with sponsors who have not done right by our
[3230.44 --> 3238.44]  community um just trying to think of some some of the most notable ones um well we dumped tunnel bear
[3238.44 --> 3246.44]  when they got acquired by someone shady yep um we there was some clothing brand um we didn't
[3246.44 --> 3252.60]  publicly dump five four okay we quietly dumped five four again that was related to customer service
[3252.60 --> 3256.76]  issues i don't even know if they're around anymore but they don't know it was hard basically there were
[3256.76 --> 3262.76]  two main issues i think the one that that broke the camel's back was so there are two things one was we
[3262.76 --> 3267.40]  had we got some complaints from viewers that didn't get dealt with in a timely manner and then the
[3267.40 --> 3273.16]  the second one the one that actually caused us to go okay this this has to end because they could
[3273.16 --> 3277.80]  have still just made it right by those customers and that would have been fixed but the one that
[3277.80 --> 3282.28]  ultimately killed it was that it was kind of hard to cancel your subscription or something and we were
[3282.28 --> 3286.52]  like hey you need to fix this yeah and then they didn't yeah um so then we didn't work with them
[3286.52 --> 3293.00]  anymore five four still exists they're a holding co of other uh intermittent shipping fashion brands
[3293.00 --> 3298.84]  all right good for them yeah sure um yeah so so i mean those are those are a couple of couple
[3298.84 --> 3305.32]  notable examples i mean obviously there was the um uh the anchor thing recently with the eufy
[3305.32 --> 3308.28]  security cameras that were more like eufy and security cameras
[3310.60 --> 3316.92]  an insecurity camera my goodness what would that be so it has an automatic filter that adds 25 pounds or what
[3316.92 --> 3324.04]  like it specifically starts automatic recording when you're like heart rate jumps
[3326.36 --> 3333.88]  do you want memories of when you're like distressed uh oh oh yeah plex is on pause right now still love
[3333.88 --> 3339.24]  plex still love the product still want to use it still want to resume the relationship but there are some
[3339.24 --> 3347.32]  key things that i need to see fixed before before we're able to to move forward um yeah i mean that's
[3347.32 --> 3354.44]  the way that we can put pressure right that's kind that's that's the way we do it because we think that
[3354.44 --> 3361.48]  there is a huge benefit to to a relationship with us to marketing with us but there's a certain bar you
[3361.48 --> 3366.20]  have to meet and that bar is only going to continue to get higher as we rely on the lab to evaluate our
[3366.20 --> 3371.32]  sponsors more and more it's something that is not in full swing yet but as we continue to build up the
[3371.32 --> 3382.84]  team there it's going to happen all right two more topics oh yeah what do you want to talk about
[3384.76 --> 3391.48]  google io sure google held their io developer conference this week the presentation primarily
[3391.48 --> 3398.28]  focused on google's ethical approach in quotes uh and integration of ai into its entire workspace suite
[3399.08 --> 3404.60]  composition assistance in gmail google docs etc ability to use text prompts to create draft
[3404.60 --> 3410.92]  spreadsheets and images and slides bar can handle 20 programming languages and will likewise use docs
[3410.92 --> 3417.56]  maps lens etc as tools similar to chat gpt's plugins which i'm not going to make a whole topic about it
[3417.56 --> 3423.88]  but they announced will be uh usable by anyone who subscribes next week including chat gpt be able
[3423.88 --> 3430.36]  to search the web and all this other kind of stuff so cool uh google also demoed demoed google search
[3430.36 --> 3436.52]  with an ai snapshot included at the top of search results which could serve as a jumping off point for
[3436.52 --> 3443.64]  further ai powered actions a la bing there's a waitlist to access this feature unsurprisingly because that's how
[3443.64 --> 3449.64]  everything's working right now which is part of search labs google introduced the future project
[3449.64 --> 3456.92]  tailwind not to be confused with tailwind which will be a personalized private ai model that learns
[3456.92 --> 3463.24]  from your documents and acts as a tutor and research assistant this is similar to their vertex ai division
[3463.24 --> 3469.40]  which will let businesses build custom ai tools with their choice of model like palm 2 imogen etc
[3469.40 --> 3476.12]  uh working with character ai a service that creates custom chat bots with different personalities
[3476.12 --> 3482.76]  even ones based off celebrities there's a chick on tiktok or something that is selling access to her ai
[3482.76 --> 3488.12]  which pretends to be your girlfriend for one dollar a minute yeah i saw that crazy google is supporting
[3488.12 --> 3496.44]  their rhetoric about ethical ai development with concrete features uh meta dagging for meta tagging for ai images
[3496.44 --> 3501.16]  ability that's a concrete feature assuming that they actually do it and assuming that it's actually
[3501.16 --> 3507.00]  accurate the second one pretty big ability to spot and highlight potential malicious code
[3508.20 --> 3512.92]  you can say what linus just said yet again uh additional context to allow users to spot
[3512.92 --> 3517.48]  misinformation such as notes on an image that show where and when it was posted on the internet
[3518.60 --> 3524.28]  a universal translator whose dubbing and lip-syncing are available only to authorize partners to prevent
[3524.28 --> 3529.96]  defects that will definitely work and never have any problems uh hardware announcements were relatively
[3529.96 --> 3536.20]  unsurprising uh the pixel fold was exactly as leaked surprise surprise the pixel tablet supports multiple
[3536.20 --> 3542.68]  users and can double as a nest hub that's actually kind of neat the pixel 7a is very similar to the 6a
[3542.68 --> 3547.96]  with modest improvements in most areas notably its refresh rate has gone from 60 to 90 that's actually
[3547.96 --> 3554.84]  pretty nice uh its main camera has a 72 percent bigger sensor and has a significant jump in resolution
[3554.84 --> 3561.00]  uh 12.2 megapixels to 64 megapixels discussion question what is the value of a company like google
[3561.00 --> 3570.60]  emphasizing thoughtful ethical approach to ai i mean it's only as good as the follow their commitment yeah
[3571.16 --> 3577.80]  it means nothing right now and google's commitment to anything is very questionable very
[3577.80 --> 3582.04]  questionable i mean i talked about this on that stream that we pulled down earlier this week oh
[3582.04 --> 3587.40]  i guess i should probably explain that at some point um i talked about this on the stream but you know the
[3587.40 --> 3593.72]  biggest the the the biggest issue for me with google's tablets and it was tablets that i was focused on
[3593.72 --> 3599.24]  when i was talking about it on the stream is that i just what do you need to do on a tablet
[3600.12 --> 3607.64]  right what no really like what i never use them so i don't know watch youtube or something
[3607.64 --> 3611.32]  yeah i mean that was that was the number one response yeah like watching youtube netflix
[3611.32 --> 3617.56]  something like that respond to email browse the web sure uh i find responding to email on a tablet
[3617.56 --> 3622.92]  very annoying but like yeah some people some people do it well remember like i don't know the way some
[3622.92 --> 3629.40]  people reply to emails like okay like they use email as you know instant messaging right so yeah but
[3629.40 --> 3637.08]  browse the web and watch video were the the number one and number two responses is there any reason that
[3637.08 --> 3645.96]  you couldn't do that on an android tablet nope no of course not so then why does everyone buy ipads
[3648.76 --> 3655.80]  because there's continuity in the ecosystem because you know that when your ipad cracks the screen
[3655.80 --> 3661.16]  or gets old there's a new one that will work just like the old one and all your stuff works
[3661.88 --> 3668.20]  and you're good to go immediately in my experience a lot of apps on android tablets are super janky and
[3668.20 --> 3672.52]  terrible uh the experience is just kind of rough like everyone i know that buys one is like yeah this
[3672.52 --> 3678.60]  thing sucks well that's because google's again because google's commitment to android tablets has been
[3678.60 --> 3685.56]  lackluster so they're not creating they're not signaling the importance of the category by supporting it
[3685.56 --> 3691.48]  properly they're not encouraging developers they're not getting hardware out there at an affordable price
[3692.12 --> 3698.36]  in a way that will incentivize developers for the platform and for consumers they're not giving them the trust
[3698.36 --> 3704.60]  that if they buy an android tablet it will be supported for a reasonable amount of time and once it reaches a
[3704.60 --> 3711.24]  reasonable end of life there will be a new one for them to transition to and so i think for me the biggest the biggest
[3711.24 --> 3717.00]  question is what's the follow-through going to be and you know back to the whole you know metadata
[3717.00 --> 3723.24]  tagging on ai generated images and all that sort of thing like what about when ai is not the silicon
[3723.24 --> 3732.28]  valley word du jour what if we go back to internet of things yeah remember internet of things yeah i mean
[3732.28 --> 3737.48]  what are some other what are some other stupid cringe i mean obviously metaverse was the the most recent
[3737.48 --> 3743.88]  one before ai web 3.0 yeah what happens when we move on to the next trendy thing that everyone wants
[3743.88 --> 3751.00]  in their in their quarterly uh in their quarterly uh earnings calls and in their new product announcements
[3751.00 --> 3756.04]  right do they just kind of say well i don't know everyone seems to be kind of over this ai thing and move on i
[3756.04 --> 3762.76]  don't i just don't know what product has google successfully launched in the last five years
[3762.76 --> 3771.00]  no really though guys for real if i'm way off base here you gotta let me know so i'm trying to think
[3771.00 --> 3779.40]  of like what i use meat isn't new i use meat all the time they like change the name a billion times
[3779.40 --> 3789.08]  but it's still just meat uh google workspace google search pixel phone dude no the original he's five years
[3789.08 --> 3795.48]  he's also he's talking about uh new verticals not individual product yeah he's not saying like
[3795.48 --> 3802.68]  releasing the eighth pixel doesn't count um yeah like an update to android auto is not releasing a
[3802.68 --> 3808.28]  product yeah although shout out android auto it sort of is but he means he means new verticals yeah
[3809.48 --> 3816.36]  yeah but the pixel also hasn't been in the last five years guys stadia stadia is not a successful launch
[3816.36 --> 3822.68]  launch i mean what what what is it it's a successful launch chromecast is very old guys
[3823.80 --> 3828.04]  simultaneous rapid deconstruction what what's the what's the term for it when you launch something
[3828.04 --> 3835.00]  and it goes up is it spud i think so sorry spud i think no no i'm talking about the rocket that blew up
[3836.68 --> 3841.56]  yeah yeah i don't remember what the actual acronym is yeah it's not an actual acronym it's just like a
[3841.56 --> 3845.72]  silly thing they were saying no it's a thing oh it's a thing yeah all right well there you go shows you what i know
[3845.72 --> 3853.64]  rudd rapid unscheduled disassembly disassembly there we go there we go yeah okay cool so i mean yeah
[3853.64 --> 3862.12]  sir you could oh come on pixel fold okay that is unproven unproven and you can't even buy it yet
[3862.92 --> 3867.96]  wireless android auto no that's iterative that's a new feature on an existing product see this is what
[3867.96 --> 3878.36]  i'm talking about with the r d budget that google has i'm still watching pixel watch is is that not
[3878.36 --> 3885.48]  like 90 dead in the water and didn't they just buy fitbit like it doesn't count if you just buy something
[3886.04 --> 3892.20]  and then i don't know i just don't get it it's a whole thing what is it the innovator's dilemma or
[3892.20 --> 3897.32]  whatever it is that explains why big companies can't invent anything anymore because it's just
[3897.32 --> 3901.80]  it's impossible because it's like not worth their time to invent things yeah but then if it's not
[3901.80 --> 3907.00]  worth your time to invent things why do you employ so many inventors yeah why don't you just all wear
[3907.00 --> 3914.76]  suits i don't know man more advertisements i mean yeah certainly that um people asking why was the stream
[3914.76 --> 3921.48]  taken down the stream was taken down because the video did not meet uh our standards for quality and
[3921.48 --> 3929.08]  because it was an archived uh vod of a live stream there was no way to really fix it and make it
[3929.08 --> 3935.32]  meet our standards for quality it was a definitely a team effort why it kind of uh sucked i want to
[3935.32 --> 3940.52]  shout out everyone who was involved in it because we all did our best to kind of turn this thing around
[3940.52 --> 3947.72]  extremely quickly when there were other distractions um unrelated to the stream unrelated to the video that
[3947.72 --> 3958.12]  were going on um i want to i want to um thank youtube for their uh for their patience with the
[3958.12 --> 3961.88]  whole with the way the whole thing went down because we we pulled the video after because i was like
[3962.44 --> 3967.48]  okay guys here's what happened the first couple minutes of the stream what was it dan like three or
[3967.48 --> 3974.52]  four minutes for what sorry uh for the for the stream earlier this week that went to the wrong stream key
[3974.52 --> 3977.56]  oh yeah it was about two and a half minutes something like that before we could figure out
[3977.56 --> 3982.44]  why so the first couple minutes of it went to the wrong stream key which was a whole thing because
[3982.44 --> 3987.80]  we had to have it scheduled because the feature that we were supposed to be showcasing youtube shopping
[3988.36 --> 3995.00]  was is was beta so it had to be activated on a specific scheduled event and we don't normally do
[3995.00 --> 4002.04]  scheduled events we go live kind of like you go live on twitch where you just start streaming in your
[4002.04 --> 4009.88]  well in our case in your encoding software and uh in our restreamer um so it just goes when it goes
[4009.88 --> 4014.44]  there is no schedule but we had to set up a schedule because they had to activate that feature so
[4016.12 --> 4021.16]  we didn't go live to the scheduled one we went live to our normal one that we use for wanshow
[4021.16 --> 4026.76]  so the title and thumbnail was wrong and then for the vod once we actually got it switched over to the
[4026.76 --> 4031.40]  scheduled one the first two and a half minutes where i even explained what the crap was going on
[4031.40 --> 4038.92]  is all gone we're missing and so all we see is me sitting there confused because i'm trying to
[4039.48 --> 4045.24]  i'm trying to process am i supposed to be sorry am i supposed to back up and we start again what do
[4045.24 --> 4049.24]  you mean we streamed to the wrong key what does that even mean because i haven't used the scheduled
[4049.24 --> 4053.48]  thing since youtube fixed their live streaming so i don't have to use it anymore so i haven't touched
[4053.48 --> 4058.12]  it in like two or three years um what does that even mean do i start at the beginning they're like no
[4058.12 --> 4061.56]  no no don't start at the beginning i'm sitting here going right but what about the vod but i can't
[4061.56 --> 4067.88]  ask these questions because i am live on stream right now having just sent a no to go live notification
[4067.88 --> 4071.48]  to thousands of people and the problem with that is you don't you don't get another one
[4072.28 --> 4076.28]  so like it seems like it did send out a second one because it's technically a different stream
[4076.28 --> 4082.36]  destination so we did get two notifications which is even worse okay but now he doesn't get another one
[4082.36 --> 4087.64]  of the right one i think your daily limit is four or five yeah but you can't burst them right i don't
[4087.64 --> 4093.16]  think so can you i'm not sure what i do know is that the reason that you have a notification limit
[4093.16 --> 4098.84]  per day the reason they're gated is because oh it's good they should viewer fatigue yeah they're trying
[4098.84 --> 4104.20]  to protect you from yourself yeah people don't want their phone blank lines left i'm busy right now but
[4104.20 --> 4107.72]  what is this we don't need something like that for flowplane but you definitely need something like
[4107.72 --> 4111.40]  that for if you're like a youtube or a twitch absolutely definitely so
[4114.28 --> 4122.28]  pretty much i was looking at it going all right what is the net benefit of leaving this up the
[4122.28 --> 4126.76]  whole point of this this the sponsored aspect of this stream because we're going to talk about google
[4126.76 --> 4133.48]  io on wan show anyway so the whole point of this sponsored stream is for them to showcase this feature
[4133.48 --> 4141.80]  that is only applicable to live pull the video go find something else upload that today yeah and
[4141.80 --> 4147.32]  so that's what we did um sorry guys i didn't mean to kind of leave people in the dark but also people
[4147.32 --> 4151.56]  seemed to mostly not care it didn't even manage to generate an outrage threat over on reddit so
[4152.44 --> 4154.76]  impressive yeah it's actually quite impressive
[4156.92 --> 4162.36]  uh did oh okay we got people asking did youtube still pay you uh yes apparently the deal is not dead
[4162.36 --> 4167.96]  we do have some more stuff coming we've got some shorts on the three new hardware devices and then
[4167.96 --> 4175.64]  we've also got um a second stream coming but the second stream is going to have a far more structured
[4175.64 --> 4182.68]  format and there will be you know a clear thing for us to talk about is uh is is the goal i think that's
[4182.68 --> 4188.76]  good yeah freaking a i mean oh go ahead i was just going to topic transition us so if you have more to
[4188.76 --> 4193.88]  say go for it well speaking of the devices i wanted to kind of um talk about those a little bit pixel
[4193.88 --> 4202.36]  7a looks killer would you ever go pixel again after the experiences you've had actually yes probably
[4202.36 --> 4207.64]  really because there's one killer feature you are basically like in an abusive relationship at this
[4207.64 --> 4213.24]  point though yep okay but if someone else releases this feature i will very likely be gone all right what is
[4213.24 --> 4223.00]  your screen call it's actually amazing and i use it all the time i have not picked up a call from a
[4223.00 --> 4233.48]  scammer in like years all right all right it's actually hilarious they always come crawling back
[4234.68 --> 4240.60]  yeah okay i even had i even had riley called me but i didn't have his like caller id in my phone
[4240.60 --> 4245.80]  and it showed up as it showed up in a way that looked super scammy because there was like yeah
[4245.80 --> 4250.20]  it just said like british columbia but there's a bunch of spaces in the middle of it so i was like
[4250.20 --> 4255.80]  oh this is definitely a scam so i screened it but then it says on the thing like very clearly he's
[4255.80 --> 4260.68]  like yeah there's something going on with flow plane i need to and i'm like okay sweet by the way i just
[4260.68 --> 4264.68]  want to make it very clear some people seem to think that the issue with the stream was google's fault it
[4264.68 --> 4274.92]  was not um okay follow-up question you've been looking kind of enviously over my shoulder at the
[4274.92 --> 4281.48]  big screen full device no for a while really nope oh okay i i thought you were pretty into like the
[4281.48 --> 4285.40]  spreadsheets and stuff uh yeah i'm not spending two thousand dollars on a phone oh i thought okay
[4285.40 --> 4292.20]  okay well you jumped ahead okay so yes it looks cool and then it looks interesting follow-up question i
[4292.20 --> 4297.08]  would really like to be able to like test drive one man i had a whole i had a whole thing i was
[4297.08 --> 4301.24]  gonna you jump right to the end like what do you think this is dennis's french fry thing
[4303.64 --> 4310.12]  okay sorry go for it okay so you've been looking over my shoulder at the big screen on the fold yeah
[4310.12 --> 4318.60]  okay oh see now you've ruined it my bad sorry i was pretty confident anywhere you're going oh man
[4318.60 --> 4323.80]  what was that now i now i don't even remember what i was gonna say um right right i was gonna
[4323.80 --> 4330.84]  say you're fairly wealthy would you would you spend the 1700s i still have a house to save up for yeah
[4330.84 --> 4337.80]  that's true all right so dropping two grand on a phone doesn't feel fun i am probably planning like
[4337.80 --> 4343.88]  this this you know september's release of phones yeah to look into something because it's been so you want
[4343.88 --> 4350.28]  an iphone don't they release other ones at that time too um might as out of the loop it's been a
[4350.28 --> 4356.04]  long time i i think the i think the new qualcomm chipset cycle is a little bit off of apple cycle
[4356.04 --> 4361.16]  right now okay yeah i think it's more it's more like spring because we just got the brand new s23
[4362.04 --> 4368.76]  i think pixel like eight is kind of where i'd be aiming yeah okay all right one more cycle because i'm
[4368.76 --> 4373.88]  i'm for a 5g at this point so i'm a little i'm a little far back yeah but you're still getting
[4373.88 --> 4379.56]  support so yeah so it's still fine for now but like it's time to start considering you know yeah
[4379.56 --> 4386.44]  that's fair yeah yeah that's fair um i i hope the tablet goes well i mean it's got a good processor
[4386.44 --> 4391.00]  it's 500 bucks it comes with the little dock and then the last one is of course the pixel fold that i
[4391.00 --> 4398.52]  will have a lot to say once i actually get hands on with it very excited but i need to really use it
[4398.76 --> 4403.48]  and you know try out some of the apps that i've had trouble with on my samsung folding devices and
[4403.48 --> 4408.36]  see if they're any better so there's a comment on full plane chat that says luke doesn't seem like
[4408.36 --> 4414.36]  the kind of person who's getting an iphone you might actually be kind of surprised um you'd be
[4414.36 --> 4419.48]  surprised about both of us i daily drove the iphone for years yep and i have nothing really against
[4419.48 --> 4427.48]  iphones my biggest issue with an iphone is because i don't generally use them the needing to learn the
[4427.48 --> 4433.32]  platform doesn't sound interesting to me but i'm not against an iphone necessarily there's honestly
[4433.32 --> 4441.32]  not a lot to learn like it's i don't know it there yeah i i don't really know what to tell you like
[4441.32 --> 4447.24]  there's there's also like weird things like i'm my phone's down there because it'll buzz the mics but
[4447.24 --> 4455.88]  um i'm a big fan of like very very clear home pages yeah i only have things on my home page like like
[4455.88 --> 4463.08]  float plane calling email like very like if i'm opening my phone it is probably for one of these
[4463.08 --> 4468.52]  types of applications i don't like the whole screen being full i'd love to i'd love someone to just like
[4468.52 --> 4475.16]  corner tim cook and ask how is it actually possible on this green and blue marble that you guys do not
[4475.16 --> 4479.56]  allow me to put my icons wherever i want on my home screen that one's actually crazy it's it's just
[4479.56 --> 4484.36]  it's one of those things that's just so obvious that you just obviously need to obviously fix this and
[4484.36 --> 4488.44]  it'll take like 20 minutes because you've obviously already done the dev work you just
[4488.44 --> 4492.68]  haven't rolled it for whatever reason it's like actually embarrassing how much that would influence
[4492.68 --> 4499.08]  my decision to get an iphone it's it's it's not even it's not even possible that some ios engineer
[4499.08 --> 4505.48]  didn't just stay late one day and fix that for lolz on a creative day that is actually not possible
[4506.28 --> 4511.40]  it might it has happened i guarantee it just the way developers work you know how developers work
[4511.40 --> 4516.36]  in fact someone would be like this this annoys me and then just and they would just fix it um
[4517.32 --> 4528.20]  because it's really stupid and really just needs to be fixed um but okay uh this is something that
[4528.20 --> 4532.44]  really annoys me like you'll find little annoyances on both this is something that's been driving me
[4532.44 --> 4537.40]  absolutely crazy on android and i don't know if it's just android or if it's the google app you know how
[4537.40 --> 4542.36]  google kept telling us okay hangouts is going away gchat is going away blah blah blah and it just like
[4542.36 --> 4547.16]  never goes away and it's just it's still there so now whenever i share i just took a screenshot i want
[4547.16 --> 4555.40]  and i clicked share um if i if i go to i hate this menu this absolutely hate this menu instead of
[4556.04 --> 4563.16]  instead of being just gmail because i clicked i clicked gmail there's now a second click no chat or do you
[4563.16 --> 4570.12]  want to do email no i don't want to do chat i actually hate that menu so much that i will always
[4570.12 --> 4574.68]  go out of my way to not use it the share menu yeah i'll just download things or copy links and then
[4574.68 --> 4579.24]  manually go to the messaging app and do it that way it's just like full of random things instead of the
[4579.24 --> 4584.84]  most recent people i talked to and just i'm like how like how does it think i'm going to share this to
[4584.84 --> 4591.16]  someone that i haven't talked to in like five years when the like three people in my life that i share
[4591.16 --> 4596.92]  things to off my phone are never here yeah like what what the heck so it literally doesn't save me
[4596.92 --> 4601.64]  time and then the amount of times that it's like i have to scroll so much to find the right app or
[4601.64 --> 4605.72]  like the right person or whatever that is just i don't know i find it very annoying okay this is
[4605.72 --> 4611.88]  great so my top one is myself my personal gmail account which i have probably never shared anything
[4611.88 --> 4621.16]  to because why would i and my second one is my work account yeah my which i would never share
[4621.16 --> 4625.48]  anything to from my oh actually that's not true i would email things to myself from time to time
[4625.48 --> 4633.32]  just because embarrassingly it's easier than just yep you know um then i've got my son my wife my aunt
[4634.20 --> 4639.80]  maybe okay oh here we go then i've got some random discord server that i have literally never shared
[4639.80 --> 4644.76]  anything to you on discord i actually do share things to you another random discord server that
[4644.76 --> 4652.28]  i have literally never shared anything to and then two completely random teams message channels one is
[4652.28 --> 4658.60]  dan dan when's the last time i shared anything to you over teams oh i mean you messaged me earlier so
[4658.60 --> 4665.32]  maybe that's why i'm there first literally never literally never literally never literally never i don't
[4665.32 --> 4673.64]  use this application literally never sometimes never wow fantastic what's the point like i just
[4673.64 --> 4681.32]  my problem is that every single icon in my share menu all of them are blue they're all blue and white
[4681.32 --> 4686.20]  i can't tell what any app is teams is blue and white facebook is blue and white twitter is blue and
[4686.20 --> 4691.72]  white they're all blue and white share with i can't oh shoot shoot shoot not that mom
[4691.72 --> 4699.32]  i'm sorry that float plane has contributed to your problem why is everything blue it's a it's a very
[4699.32 --> 4710.20]  neutral like things are fine color um yeah anyways should i topic pivot us sure should we move on uh
[4710.20 --> 4716.68]  youtube another youtube thing uh youtube has confirmed that it is experimenting with blocking some users
[4716.68 --> 4725.64]  with ad blockers enabled from watching videos on the platform spicy youtube has previously addressed
[4725.64 --> 4731.64]  to this issue but it has been a few years since the last time there's a screenshot of a youtube notice
[4731.64 --> 4737.56]  to users with an ad block uh enabled that was posted to reddit um that's just the youtube logo it says
[4737.56 --> 4741.88]  ad blockers are not allowed on youtube it looks like you may be using an ad blocker ads allow youtube to
[4741.88 --> 4747.88]  stay free for billions of users worldwide you can go ad free with youtube premium and creators can
[4747.88 --> 4753.64]  still get paid from your subscription and then there's a button uh that says allow youtube ads
[4753.64 --> 4757.88]  and then there's another button that says try youtube premium i don't know what allow youtube ads would do
[4758.76 --> 4766.76]  um oh maybe it maybe what have they like scripted away for your to disable the extension on that that must
[4766.76 --> 4772.92]  only work through chrome or something i don't know i mean most people are using chrome so maybe it
[4772.92 --> 4779.96]  works yeah i don't know uh the more legitimate criticisms include that youtube's ads have increased
[4779.96 --> 4784.92]  a great deal over time and that youtube premium is relatively expensive from the perspective of
[4784.92 --> 4796.36]  occasional viewers discussion question is there any better way to convince people to pay for content um no
[4797.00 --> 4801.88]  that's my response i i don't think like i'm not saying this is necessarily a good way
[4803.00 --> 4809.24]  but i don't think there's a different way like how do i how do i how do i even talk about this without
[4809.24 --> 4813.08]  starting some kind of firestorm oh yeah you're just gonna get wrecked because i think the entire
[4813.08 --> 4819.16]  i wish i was wearing my ad block yeah privateering shirt because the entire counter argument to me
[4819.80 --> 4828.20]  last time around was that if consuming the ads was the form of payment for consuming content on the
[4828.20 --> 4833.56]  platform then google would block ad blockers so okay here we are um
[4840.12 --> 4846.12]  i don't know what else to tell you guys and i believe the main defense at that time was well it's
[4846.12 --> 4852.44]  like not actually like in the terms or something i guess it is now i guess so um is that better
[4853.32 --> 4858.04]  i mean yeah happy about this yeah it's one it's one of those things where um
[4859.88 --> 4863.56]  people are saying like flow plane i'm like yeah i think if people weren't subscribed on flow plane and
[4863.56 --> 4866.92]  they had ad block on youtube and then this happens i don't necessarily know that they're going to
[4866.92 --> 4873.32]  subscribe on flow plane like these options have existed yeah already so if they weren't already
[4873.32 --> 4877.24]  subscribed to it then that option is not the better way to convince people because it already
[4877.24 --> 4885.00]  existed and i actually didn't say you may not use ad blockers i mean we've even talked about in the
[4885.00 --> 4890.20]  past we showed people how to set up a freaking pie hole yeah we've shown multiple times how to set up
[4890.20 --> 4896.76]  these types of services all i said was you've got to consider the consequences of your actions yeah the
[4896.76 --> 4905.16]  consequences are real the more people block ads the more a platform will become actually not sustainable
[4905.72 --> 4912.76]  and they will introduce more draconian anti-ad blocking measures that's just how it works that's i
[4912.76 --> 4921.80]  don't make these rules i'm just i'm the messenger time to shoot please no raise your weapons not shoot
[4921.80 --> 4928.04]  not shoot the messenger i don't think they'll ever do anything about sponsor block though um
[4928.60 --> 4933.56]  i don't know that's not their that's not their thing though yeah i guess so there's no actual
[4933.56 --> 4938.44]  financial incentive for them trying to block sponsor block yeah that's true
[4941.88 --> 4946.28]  it's hard to say i mean i wouldn't even put it past them to just say look we don't allow any
[4946.28 --> 4951.24]  extensions that interfere with the functionality of youtube will that will that make youtube a
[4951.24 --> 4954.92]  worse experience for some users i mean i don't think there's any i don't think it technically
[4954.92 --> 4959.80]  does though it just skips you forward in the video right um i genuinely haven't used it i don't know what
[4959.80 --> 4965.64]  it does yeah it skips around in the video yeah um but i just using timestamp functionality it just
[4965.64 --> 4971.24]  wouldn't surprise me yeah no for sure yeah but yeah that's uh
[4973.64 --> 4980.12]  that is what it is i'm not surprised every once in a while i'll get like i'll be in my google news
[4980.12 --> 4985.80]  thing and i'll jump to a web page and it's like no you can't watch this because i have it export to
[4985.80 --> 4992.60]  my browser and it blah blah blah blah blah you can't view this page unless you subscribe it's not an ad
[4992.60 --> 4999.00]  blocking thing but it's just like some news page that requires a paygate yeah and i'm like okay well
[4999.00 --> 5004.36]  i'm not going to do that so i'm going to leave and the argument is like oh well you lost their traffic
[5004.36 --> 5011.16]  whatever and it's like yeah but i'm also not taxing their service and if i didn't pay and they didn't
[5011.16 --> 5018.36]  have ads and i did view it how am i benefiting them so like i don't know i don't know that that's
[5018.36 --> 5022.44]  necessarily the wrong call for them that might be the right call for them maybe this newspaper makes a
[5022.44 --> 5026.52]  bunch of money through subscriptions and they just it's better for them to operate that way it's not
[5026.52 --> 5032.60]  my decision yep it is my decision to just not pay it well this is another like big controversy that i
[5032.60 --> 5037.08]  started when i said look the provider of the service or the product is the one who sets the price
[5038.60 --> 5046.52]  and if you don't like it you don't pay it but just taking it is actually not um how that works yeah so
[5046.52 --> 5051.32]  like i don't find some way to like break around that limitation i just don't read the article just go
[5051.32 --> 5057.88]  find something else there is an incredible amount of stuff on the internet you really don't actually
[5057.88 --> 5065.16]  need to access that one thing truer words never spoken it's like actually okay there really is an
[5065.16 --> 5071.24]  incredible amount of stuff on the internet your life will go on if you can't access that one video
[5071.24 --> 5076.52]  or article or whatever it is you'll you'll be fine so i don't know i don't have a lot to say about this
[5076.52 --> 5083.24]  i am a youtube premium subscriber so like this won't affect me i watch a bunch of youtube so it's
[5083.24 --> 5088.52]  like and i use youtube music yeah i don't believe youtube music is the best but it comes with youtube
[5088.52 --> 5094.12]  premium yeah and i'm not going to pay for anything else great value so it is what it is and when like
[5094.12 --> 5098.20]  i look at the bundle and i do consider that i do actually use youtube music all the time
[5099.08 --> 5104.60]  like i run it for basically at least eight hours a day yeah because i use it for just background noise when
[5104.60 --> 5110.12]  i'm working yeah i get i get the value out of my youtube premium subscription for sure
[5112.68 --> 5117.80]  yeah i don't know what to tell you guys don't know what to tell you guys other than this is
[5117.80 --> 5123.40]  this is what happens and this is okay this is fair uh someone in flow plane chat said if you give
[5123.40 --> 5129.64]  someone something or a service that will become an expectation uh when it changes people feel wronged
[5129.64 --> 5134.76]  um and and that yeah that's legit yeah so i could i could understand people that have used ad blockers
[5134.76 --> 5140.84]  on youtube for like a decade that are it's now being blocked being like well that's annoying yeah
[5140.84 --> 5148.92]  yeah sure yeah but like youtube's response to that may end up rightly being you mad bro yeah like
[5149.56 --> 5154.60]  realistically i mean you can say you're gonna go somewhere else but when you're trying to figure out
[5154.60 --> 5161.88]  how to fix your dishwasher you won't you'll go to youtube i you can you can some people will kind
[5161.88 --> 5170.04]  of will sputter and angrily say no i will yes you will yes you will because that's the fastest
[5170.04 --> 5175.80]  because your time is worth money which is exactly how the ads work your time is worth money and that
[5175.80 --> 5180.52]  will be the fastest way to get that dishwasher repaired you'd be silly not to right it's it's tough
[5180.52 --> 5187.64]  you just watch the ads you can you can literally you can load it up have the ads play put it down
[5187.64 --> 5191.48]  gather your tools and then when the ads are done playing pick it back up again people are talking a
[5191.48 --> 5197.00]  lot about how much the uh how much the prevalence of ads has increased on the platform lately and
[5197.00 --> 5203.08]  honestly that is that is a big challenge um i i do find it pretty obnoxious whenever i'm accidentally
[5203.08 --> 5208.92]  on an account that doesn't have a youtube premium to me it's it's always it's felt like the the gas price
[5208.92 --> 5214.28]  problem where like it feels like oh like tons of people are blocking ads or whatever other reason
[5214.28 --> 5219.00]  so we need to increase ads and then oh we blocked ad blockers but they're not going to pull the ads
[5219.00 --> 5226.04]  back probably uh because they're like well let me find we can serve you this many already and there's a
[5226.04 --> 5234.36]  lot of pressure on creators to increase the frequency of ads i mean here um i got this report from colton
[5234.36 --> 5242.60]  earlier that uh apparently is from patty galloway's latest newsletter something something i hope this
[5242.60 --> 5246.92]  isn't like a paid newsletter or something that i am not supposed to talk about it's like i just want
[5246.92 --> 5252.84]  to address this quickly crusty trombone and full plane chat said nah it's principle ads are toxic i i don't
[5252.84 --> 5259.08]  disagree which is why i have premium and run flow plane and do stuff like that i don't like ads i avoid
[5259.08 --> 5266.36]  them as much as i can but like i don't do that with an ad blocker yeah that's that's not actually
[5266.36 --> 5274.04]  your call to make if the if the service says the the payment is ads then your options are
[5276.84 --> 5283.48]  consume the service and pay with ads don't consume the service or privateer and just know what you're
[5283.48 --> 5289.16]  doing that's what you're doing so i have my like the level that i'm happy with um and you can have
[5289.16 --> 5297.00]  your own and that's why this is great i love anger mon or agerman over on twitch chat i don't understand
[5297.00 --> 5305.08]  who the f is buying crap out of ads me either and yet here we are they're clearly they're clearly working
[5305.08 --> 5315.16]  pretty good um yeah so okay this is this is really interesting it's an evaluation of rpm so revenue per
[5315.16 --> 5322.92]  mil which does not mean million it means thousand uh by average view duration and the um the argument
[5322.92 --> 5332.12]  made to me by our business team is you know hey um with how long wan show runs the adsense numbers for it
[5332.12 --> 5339.96]  would be insane like potentially three times what we're making um which is thousands of us dollars
[5339.96 --> 5347.64]  per episode additionally for wan show um got to check and get approval from linus can you loop me in um
[5348.68 --> 5357.40]  and basically yeah our our rpms are substantially lower than what they should be based on this like
[5357.40 --> 5364.20]  average rpm per video length you know chart here and basically my my response is the part we're missing
[5364.20 --> 5369.48]  here in our calculations is the rpm of our baked in stuff maybe for something like wan show we should
[5369.48 --> 5375.56]  cut our rates cut the sponsors out and do mid rolls i just don't want to overdo it right because that's
[5375.56 --> 5382.68]  the problem that i see on the platform is that you've got you've got people trying to triple dip right
[5382.68 --> 5389.08]  they've got the pre-roll ad and then they've got the mid roll ad and then they've got the shout out
[5389.08 --> 5393.80]  for their patreon and then they've got the shout out for their sponsor and then they've got the shout
[5393.80 --> 5399.96]  out for their merch and so i think we were overdoing it for a while and in each video we had a merch
[5399.96 --> 5407.80]  shout out plus a float plane shout out we've dialed that back so we are at um no mid so our our typical
[5407.80 --> 5414.68]  loadout on ltd anyway is that we have pre-rolls enabled no mid rolls uh we do have our own baked
[5414.68 --> 5421.80]  in sponsorship spots and we will call out either float plane or um the ltd store in a way that is
[5421.80 --> 5425.96]  organically integrated into the content that's sort of our our loadout right now and seems to be
[5427.48 --> 5432.52]  about as high as you can go without it being obnoxious and there's been a lot of arguments
[5432.52 --> 5437.16]  internally pushing me to turn mid roll ads on and every time i kind of come back and i say okay sure
[5437.96 --> 5438.92]  what are we getting rid of
[5441.56 --> 5447.48]  and the answer is always i don't know i think we have a pretty i think we have a pretty
[5448.36 --> 5453.24]  optimal configuration right now and i don't i don't think we're going to change it anytime soon
[5453.24 --> 5458.44]  especially when they're dentist ads we'll see yeah yeah i think if anything what we need to do is just
[5458.44 --> 5463.88]  make our baked in stuff more engaging and convert better and then we can increase our rates for that
[5463.88 --> 5467.72]  if we really want more money like let's just work for it yeah i guess is my response make the
[5467.72 --> 5471.56]  ads content i know there's a few other creators in the space doing that type of thing too where it's
[5471.56 --> 5476.28]  like you actually want to watch the ads because they're just funny yeah and it's like okay cool
[5477.32 --> 5480.84]  if you want to win me over that way like fair enough in my opinion
[5482.44 --> 5488.44]  uh last week was not dennis spots on wan show that's why it wasn't as entertaining uh flip plane chat
[5488.44 --> 5494.76]  uh dennis is on vacation so oh yeah we had the thorium proposal but that wasn't i know i guess that was a
[5494.76 --> 5500.36]  sponsor spot right i forgot that's how that's how organically integrated it was i forgot it was a
[5500.36 --> 5505.48]  sponsor spot speaking of sponsors hey perfect segue time perfect segue

[5614.04 --> 5618.44]  using the link in the video description the show is also brought to you by i guess we spoiled it
[5618.44 --> 5624.20]  csonic csonics prime tx 1000 watt power supply is a great choice for high performance systems
[5624.20 --> 5629.24]  features an 80 plus titanium efficiency rating which means less power gets wasted during power conversion
[5629.24 --> 5635.40]  it's also fully modular and features hybrid fan control to control overall fan noise and it's got
[5635.40 --> 5640.68]  fluid dynamic bearings so when that fan is spinning it's going to be super quiet plus it comes with a
[5640.68 --> 5645.88]  12 year warranty you can trust them bro actually i did see quite a few positive comments about csonic
[5645.88 --> 5649.64]  when we were discussing the whole warranty thing unrelated to their sponsor talking points but it's not
[5649.64 --> 5653.32]  surprising to me at all if you're building a new system and looking for a power supply that you can rely
[5653.32 --> 5659.80]  on you can trust csonic check them out at csonic.com or through the links down below all right dan you
[5659.80 --> 5665.24]  got a couple merch messages i suspect you do because you made me use the camera i couldn't help noticing
[5665.24 --> 5672.36]  that a few people might have bought some stick locks oh just a couple just a couple a couple people bought
[5672.36 --> 5678.36]  them i will also say i just noticed you are too well i've been messing with these like the whole show
[5678.36 --> 5683.08]  i think they're legitimately just as good as a fidget toy as they are a stick lock
[5685.08 --> 5691.80]  oh boy dual purpose everything we sell turns into a fidget toy the screwdriver this yeah i think that
[5691.80 --> 5693.72]  says more about us than maybe
[5696.84 --> 5702.92]  okay let's uh let's see let's see uh first one here hey lld a long time watcher since my formative
[5702.92 --> 5707.08]  tween years prior to getting more into tech i am ashamed to admit that i attempted to
[5707.08 --> 5713.40]  download more ram what has been your most dumb tech mistake oh it was definitely the time that i
[5713.40 --> 5720.20]  plugged the floppy power connector into a header on an adding card fried that bad boy fried it good
[5720.76 --> 5728.36]  i've only ever i was very young accidentally murdered one piece of hardware that i can remember
[5729.32 --> 5733.16]  and it was really early on at the company i just roasted a motherboard do you remember that
[5733.16 --> 5740.12]  just flashed the wrong bios onto it and it just never came back nice i was like really early on
[5740.12 --> 5746.76]  i was really embarrassed nice i think it was my personal board but that computer was a computer that
[5746.76 --> 5753.00]  i got from you right okay and i needed it for work because i was doing forum stuff so it was like uh
[5755.00 --> 5761.64]  nice yeah and then you gave me like if i remember correctly you gave me what was technically an
[5761.64 --> 5769.40]  upgraded board but it was like uh you know when you you go high enough that like the support for
[5769.40 --> 5773.88]  it is bad and it's like actually worse experience because you're not going to use the features and
[5773.88 --> 5781.72]  like yeah it was one of those situations nice yeah so that was that was really unfortunate but yeah
[5782.20 --> 5788.28]  i can still heal him popping on the table there um sorry all right next up wondering if you've ever
[5788.28 --> 5791.64]  considered exploring the technology behind power generation plants
[5795.16 --> 5800.84]  i mean sounds super cool sounds like the kind of place that would be a little tough to get a tour of
[5800.84 --> 5806.68]  yeah um absolutely on that second point yeah i mean is anyone going to show us you know the nitty
[5806.68 --> 5811.48]  gritty of a nuclear power plant would i be interested in anything that isn't a nuclear power plant
[5811.48 --> 5821.56]  i mean what am i going to go look at like a coal fire yesterday's technology today the furnace it's real
[5821.56 --> 5824.20]  big wow that's hot
[5827.56 --> 5832.76]  okay yeah we're joking like obviously there's more interesting than that yeah and it gets more advanced
[5832.76 --> 5840.84]  a lot of technology but um yeah no i can't say that that's my most that that's the most up my alley
[5840.84 --> 5847.32]  that something could be yeah okay and last one we're gonna have a look at here i've worked in both
[5847.32 --> 5852.52]  banking and engineering and in both we solely use virtual machines for their increased security and
[5852.52 --> 5858.76]  work from home as lmg grows do you think you will switch to some if not all employees to virtual machines
[5858.76 --> 5865.72]  um definitely not all no i think for high performance applications like video editing
[5866.52 --> 5876.60]  it's just it's a not a clear enough benefit for security to outweigh the improved performance and
[5876.60 --> 5883.56]  b my understanding is it's not a supported use case for any of the major video editing software users
[5883.56 --> 5890.52]  and working within a vm theoretically is completely transparent to the software but in practice
[5890.52 --> 5901.56]  is not always completely bug free and i adobe creative suite does not need it's got enough bugs yeah it
[5901.56 --> 5909.32]  doesn't need more problems so i think we're going to use it in in in a best case scenario on a bare
[5909.32 --> 5919.56]  metal workstation basically forever i could see some kind of thin client or some kind of um vdi
[5921.08 --> 5926.12]  thing for just general workstations in fact i think we're going to do a video in the next little bit just
[5926.76 --> 5933.80]  kind of exploring vdi because we've never really dug into it but i don't see us just rolling that out
[5933.80 --> 5940.28]  wholesale wholesale anytime soon but yeah i i can't i can't think of any reason that like a sales person
[5940.28 --> 5946.92]  or someone in accounting couldn't just be working off a thin client or we're gonna have to right now
[5946.92 --> 5953.40]  we have one standard and it's not good um like it's not good to have one standard i should say the
[5953.40 --> 5959.32]  standard that was made might have been very good for an important subset of people which would be high
[5959.32 --> 5965.08]  performance users like editors but we have so many different types of people at the company now
[5965.08 --> 5971.40]  in regards to what they do um that just having one doesn't make a ton of sense so yeah we might have a
[5971.40 --> 5976.68]  variety of different options down the line but it will vary quite a bit pat zilla in floatplane chat
[5976.68 --> 5980.92]  says having to use thin clients at work makes me want to bash my head against my desk it's god-awful
[5980.92 --> 5987.40]  slow right but that depends yeah right that depends on what the hardware behind the thin client is the
[5987.40 --> 5993.48]  thin client doesn't affect the performance it's the actual vm that it's tapped into and there are
[5993.48 --> 5998.36]  high performance thin clients my understanding is they're very common in the like cad and design
[5998.36 --> 6002.76]  industry and i think that's to do with that it's cheaper from a software licensing standpoint or
[6002.76 --> 6007.88]  something like that because the software is so expensive that you're basically an idiot to be
[6008.44 --> 6014.04]  buying one seat for every person who might use it and you're far better off buying many licenses and
[6014.04 --> 6018.12]  then sharing them or something don't quote me on that it's just something that i heard at some point
[6018.12 --> 6027.64]  maybe nice nice um but yeah well things will things will change okay so let's uh get a couple
[6027.64 --> 6032.92]  of potentials out here if you want uh hey lld for linus wondering if basketball shorts are a thing
[6032.92 --> 6040.12]  that's on the menu will we eventually do that no no he's saying it's not on the menu not that we'll never
[6040.12 --> 6045.88]  do it yeah yeah the first thing yeah okay i think it's pretty unlikely though are there not enough
[6045.88 --> 6050.20]  brands that make basketball shorts like basketball shorts are one of those things where it's just what
[6050.20 --> 6057.80]  would we be adding to the conversation hey dll steve or austin going to ltx neither has been confirmed or
[6057.80 --> 6064.28]  denied then i guess i can neither confirm nor deny oh exciting well no i mean it's just the thing is
[6064.28 --> 6070.36]  like it's not it's not up to me to to announce things like that for people um uh okay fine i'll
[6070.36 --> 6075.96]  tell you what i'll say this they've both been invited but life happens right it's people aren't
[6075.96 --> 6081.32]  always available even if creators are very busy people even if we were actually bffs right that
[6081.32 --> 6085.88]  doesn't mean they can necessarily make it it's ltx it's not my wedding i'm not going to be mad
[6085.88 --> 6089.48]  right if they can make it that's awesome i think it's going to be a great event and if they can't make
[6089.48 --> 6094.76]  it well then hey that i'll see you next year that's awesome that'll be a great event too it's all good
[6094.76 --> 6102.20]  about some more ltx ones hello me audio only me tomorrow dll how do we buy products and have them
[6102.20 --> 6111.40]  waiting for pickup at ltx also uh rest in peace hotel prices over the last two years oh i don't know
[6111.40 --> 6123.88]  it's not a thing yet what a oh okay is that the answer i believe um i think okay somebody's gonna
[6123.88 --> 6128.84]  scream at me i'm trying to remember oh you're gonna pull no answer yet i'll say that much there we go
[6128.84 --> 6133.40]  all right because i know if you're if you're here locally you can buy stuff here locally but there's
[6133.40 --> 6138.28]  gonna be a well you can buy stuff oh oh you mean if you come to the show yes you can buy stuff yeah
[6138.28 --> 6143.32]  yeah but i don't mean right now if you're in bc you can buy stuff locally i mean if you're if you're
[6143.32 --> 6151.40]  at ltx there's going to be like a store and you can buy stuff um there is also the the remote bridge
[6151.40 --> 6157.32]  thing that we're planning where floatplane and ltx store are going to have a login authentication thingy
[6157.32 --> 6163.00]  to see if you are currently subscribed at whatever blah blah blah so that you can buy stuff um and that's
[6163.00 --> 6171.64]  not done yet so we don't know exactly when it will be ready got it more ltx oh i do have a bit of an
[6171.64 --> 6179.16]  update on lttstore.com though okay i think we've settled on a location for it sorry that's me uh i
[6179.16 --> 6184.28]  think it's going to oh uh oh uh oh did i say something wrong you must have said something wrong
[6184.28 --> 6190.04]  because probably did the one and only nick light has made a call to me what i do wrong i have two things
[6190.04 --> 6197.00]  one one from this and one from earlier so got two things one right here one right here yeah um if you
[6197.00 --> 6203.64]  have an ltx ticket you should be able to pre-purchase your merch already on the ltx site oh cool you just
[6203.64 --> 6209.88]  have to use the same email to log in on the site as you bought the ticket with neat yeah and then the
[6209.88 --> 6214.84]  other thing was when you're talking about retailers earlier um we are figuring out our retail strategy i
[6214.84 --> 6220.20]  can't really say more than that right now um on live but um that's why we don't have like updates
[6220.20 --> 6226.20]  on microcenter and stuff it's not on their side it's on our side oh really yeah oh okay so
[6229.56 --> 6234.28]  if you want you can call me after the show oh okay all right sure so all right later
[6238.60 --> 6242.84]  we summoned nick we said too many things wrong let's see if we can do it again
[6244.84 --> 6251.48]  twice in the same show would be pretty great we should see how many different people we can
[6251.48 --> 6255.16]  summit on one show oh tynan's already been uh blowing up my phone
[6258.12 --> 6263.32]  so that's two is he upset about stick locks because uh he worked on stick locks he asked me to message
[6263.32 --> 6269.16]  him and i ghosted him nice well that's just rude he will watch it back later i don't know why he wants i
[6269.16 --> 6275.40]  i think he just excited who knows um it's all merch by the way not just ltx merch the the idea is that
[6275.40 --> 6279.16]  you can place your order and then just like pick it up when you're there which will make more sense the
[6279.16 --> 6286.20]  closer to the event we get yeah yeah not really yeah right so i wanted to give the update on ltdstore.com
[6286.84 --> 6292.84]  we have not decided to proceed with the retail space that we found that was pretty cool because i think what
[6292.84 --> 6299.72]  what we're going to do is more of like a warehousey style thing where you can you can pick up but also
[6299.72 --> 6305.64]  it'll be like operating as a warehouse and it'll be in more of like an industrial area i think it's
[6305.64 --> 6311.56]  going to be where the little gym is now and so that'll become ltdstore.com so this is this is how
[6311.56 --> 6315.64]  you're going to tell me that i'm not getting my wish oh you're getting your wish
[6315.64 --> 6325.00]  so i have other big news our financing got approved for a second what what about second
[6325.00 --> 6333.88]  badminton unit oh um so the badminton center is going to be substantially larger yeah it will be 14
[6333.88 --> 6341.08]  courts now uh and there will be a pretty decent like 1600 1800 square foot gym
[6341.08 --> 6351.48]  of badminton courts no of like 1600 not 16 000 yeah yeah what's gonna be there
[6352.28 --> 6356.92]  i don't know i was gonna ask you like what's good like it's an actual like gym like a workout gym yeah
[6356.92 --> 6365.56]  like for members that's pretty cool yeah so i'm suddenly like way more excited yeah i know because
[6365.56 --> 6371.48]  you're serious yeah oh that's sick that's sick i've been trying to convince him to have the current
[6371.48 --> 6375.40]  one turned into a gym for a long time and there's all these like liability problems which are legit
[6375.40 --> 6383.32]  so i understand yeah but it would just be sweet if it was like a thing wow that's cool yeah it's gonna
[6383.32 --> 6390.60]  be awesome so uh obviously everyone who works at yvonne umbrella corporation uh any of the companies under
[6390.60 --> 6398.84]  there will will be able to get access to the gym ybc i i don't i don't know okay so here's the thing
[6398.84 --> 6404.60]  i don't know if i'll be able to just be like yeah you get it for free because that could hurt the kpis
[6404.60 --> 6410.44]  of the operations manager who we have uh actually hired now uh who's going to be running that that's
[6410.44 --> 6415.88]  a lot of people to give access to that for free yeah so i'll have similar working schedules and yeah so
[6415.88 --> 6420.76]  i don't want to screw anyone over just go like hey yeah you know your kpis is that you have to be
[6420.76 --> 6426.84]  profitable oh by the way you have a hundred free users in your gym good luck
[6429.80 --> 6434.84]  that's pretty funny uh sultan of slack asks so when's the pickleball tournament yeah probably when
[6434.84 --> 6440.52]  i turn about 55 we'll convert it to pickleball that's that's that's what i kind of have in mind
[6440.52 --> 6445.24]  just gonna be like hey everyone who was playing everyone shut it down shut it down okay we're moving
[6445.24 --> 6449.96]  the nets down moving the nets down okay we're pickleball facility change the sign wooden paddles
[6449.96 --> 6455.40]  now yeah or whatever it is i think it's wooden paddles i don't remember yeah i'm excited i'm
[6455.40 --> 6461.48]  excited it's gonna be awesome yeah super excited okay what we're saying down when can we be expect
[6461.48 --> 6467.40]  to be notified if we are selected to volunteer at ltx oh i don't think either of us are gonna know
[6467.96 --> 6474.20]  i have no idea yep i would hope pretty soon yep like if we haven't told people pretty soon then it's
[6474.20 --> 6481.64]  gonna be pretty tough for them to schedule um uh you know what i would do is post on the forum
[6481.64 --> 6487.56]  because i know that uh chase is monitoring the ltx thread there yeah post on the ltt forum this might
[6487.56 --> 6492.36]  be a question for tyna but has there been any testing to see if the stick locks fit on the steam
[6492.36 --> 6499.72]  deck inside the oem case that's a good question tynan would probably know that um it used to be that our
[6499.72 --> 6504.04]  inventory was right on the other side of this wall here and i could just run and grab a steam deck case
[6505.00 --> 6514.44]  but it's not so i don't know yeah we'd have to figure that out and let's see does the bag you
[6514.44 --> 6519.00]  are developing for consoles like the steam deck have some kind of stick protection built in the steam
[6519.00 --> 6525.72]  deck's original case has some cutouts to give the stick space for example yeah it doesn't but it's also
[6525.72 --> 6530.84]  very very early in development right now and that's not impossible but it could be very
[6530.84 --> 6535.88]  challenging so depending on the route we go if we go switch specific then it could but if we go
[6535.88 --> 6542.68]  universal then it wouldn't be able to then you should bundle it with some stick locks there we go sick
[6543.88 --> 6548.28]  i think we should yeah we can move on here if you guys like yeah sure
[6548.28 --> 6555.80]  two to three more topics please let's talk about this watch thing yeah let's talk about this watch
[6555.80 --> 6565.48]  thing because i am ticked oh boy fossil who acquired misfit in 2015 has discontinued support for misfit
[6565.48 --> 6574.04]  watches the companion app and website what this means get this is that users will no longer be able to
[6574.04 --> 6583.32]  adjust some settings including changing the time and am i right they still sell them um the most
[6583.32 --> 6588.20]  recent models of misfit watches were launched in 2018 and only stopped production in late 2019 and early
[6588.20 --> 6595.32]  2020 fossil still sells smart watches based on misfits hybrid watch technology fossil doesn't appear to
[6595.32 --> 6602.12]  have made any announcement it simply dropped misfit from its brand page and users found themselves unable to log in
[6602.12 --> 6607.00]  are you kidding me
[6610.44 --> 6610.60]  now
[6613.08 --> 6617.96]  fossil confirmed oh okay when we oh we apparently contacted them oh good job
[6617.96 --> 6624.76]  wanshow team fossil confirmed it was indeed dropping support for misfit when contacted by linus media group
[6624.76 --> 6638.76]  you know i never really got it before the whole expensive watch thing you know like like big like
[6638.76 --> 6645.64]  mechanical watches you know it'll still work at least it'll still work what the heck
[6645.64 --> 6653.32]  and this is like a premium brand someone can't remotely take it from you i think it is i don't
[6653.32 --> 6662.28]  actually know but i'm pretty sure it is uh fossil how is it even possible that there is no obligation
[6662.28 --> 6670.04]  if you drop support for a product you sold to open source it how is that even possible in the year 2023
[6670.04 --> 6676.68]  oh star wars collaboration with fossils so i can get luke laptop let's go they have they have luke
[6676.68 --> 6683.80]  skywalker leather watch no wait wait wait wait stop looking at that okay okay luke yes what did that pop-up
[6683.80 --> 6684.04]  say
[6686.84 --> 6689.00]  you have my superpower too i saw you do it
[6691.08 --> 6698.04]  i actually i remember it was like yellowy or gold or something and nothing i know nothing else about it
[6698.04 --> 6705.80]  that's all just the color that i might even i might be right about that but i might be conflating
[6705.80 --> 6710.36]  it with this golden watch that's on the screen okay so we're back to luke's laptop here yeah i just
[6710.36 --> 6715.56]  found that they did this star wars collaboration i thought it was funny because linus is not into
[6715.56 --> 6721.72]  high-end fashion particularly and also isn't into modern star wars so that would be funny yeah that
[6721.72 --> 6727.24]  would be the not linus watch right there especially this one because it's so gaudy wow
[6728.36 --> 6734.84]  that would not suit you at all thanks no problem i don't think any of these would suit me those dog
[6734.84 --> 6745.32]  tags cringe are those actual dogs literally for 120 bucks and it says three c3po on it do people buy this
[6748.28 --> 6753.80]  we need to just have more there's zero reviews no no luke we need to just have more products because
[6753.80 --> 6760.44]  people are obviously just looking for something to throw money at at this point yeah really rt okay
[6761.08 --> 6767.24]  okay the earrings are cute the earrings are pretty cute the charm bracelets like that's probably all
[6767.24 --> 6775.08]  right oh so fossils like not premium then like these are okay to be clear 500 600 dollars for a while
[6775.08 --> 6783.96]  obviously that's like a lot of money but watches yeah so they're not they as far as i can tell they're
[6783.96 --> 6790.28]  not like insane but they're not cheap either yeah okay 250 purses that's not i don't know i don't know
[6790.28 --> 6800.44]  anything to be honest yeah about that stuff no no idea got it anyways that's some bs you should not
[6800.44 --> 6804.84]  be able to just like turn off someone's ability to change the time on their watch yeah this whole thing
[6804.84 --> 6812.92]  this whole thing is just okay fine here let's talk about the badminton center some more
[6813.96 --> 6822.28]  because i think that it's a waste of life to just mop a giant floor um i wanted to look into getting a
[6822.28 --> 6829.56]  robot sweeper and sweeper and vacuum and and mop like thing i i assume that has to be a thing these
[6829.56 --> 6834.68]  days you know given that i don't think anyone has one manually mopping airports yeah but you have like
[6834.68 --> 6840.68]  a consumer grade one yeah so i want a commercial grade one that could do you know 30 000 square feet
[6840.68 --> 6847.24]  really really right yeah exactly um so i rightly assumed that this is an actual product category that
[6847.24 --> 6854.12]  does exist um naturally the if i remembered the brand i would i would name them because it's kind of
[6854.12 --> 6859.80]  hilarious and stupid um and they deserve to be called hilarious and stupid but naturally you go
[6859.80 --> 6865.48]  on their site there's no information whatsoever about pricing because why would there be you have
[6865.48 --> 6871.32]  to contact someone this is great you contact someone so that you can get on a call with them
[6871.32 --> 6879.24]  that person cannot tell you anything their entire job is to set up an appointment for you
[6879.24 --> 6885.72]  with someone from the sales team i was like okay well this was a giant waste of time thank you very
[6885.72 --> 6893.00]  much um i sure fine schedule me another call because if you can't tell me how much it costs then i guess
[6893.00 --> 6899.48]  we're not having a conversation right now so what's the point of talking about anything is that better
[6899.48 --> 6904.28]  than a robo caller would you prefer robo color in that in that situation i mean it might as well but
[6904.28 --> 6908.20]  if you already have the online scheduling thing that i used to set up the first call
[6910.44 --> 6915.24]  then it's just online scheduling with extra steps right like it yeah so anyway they set up
[6916.12 --> 6924.76]  they set up the second call with me and um we got we got as far as price and the price is about like
[6924.76 --> 6930.92]  to outright buy because they they offer like a subscription service or an outright buy price and the price to
[6930.92 --> 6939.40]  buy is about like a mid-range car uh which honestly could make sense it could you know compared to
[6939.40 --> 6945.16]  paying a person i then i guarantee you for five years or whatever what you just said is exactly how
[6945.16 --> 6950.36]  it's priced of course it's not priced based on the actual hardware it's a mop right like it's
[6951.80 --> 6957.08]  it's it's price based on the the value that it provides which is not a wrong way to price something but
[6957.08 --> 6962.20]  uh it's a little frustrating that was so high but that doesn't mean that i wasn't considering it i was
[6962.20 --> 6969.80]  considering it and then i asked you know what the process is like okay so uh how does it handle like
[6969.80 --> 6976.20]  vision how does it navigate the facility and they go okay well uh we come out and we help you set it up
[6976.20 --> 6982.60]  we get the the mapping configured and the routing configured and everything and then uh and then it just
[6982.60 --> 6988.44]  like it runs on on your schedule and it goes and it does the thing and i'm like okay super cool uh
[6989.08 --> 6994.60]  what if i need to update the map for whatever reason we reconfigure it um you know how is that done
[6994.60 --> 6998.52]  and they're like oh we can help you with that remotely you log into our cloud thing and i go okay
[6998.52 --> 7003.64]  hold on a second can i just clarify something does this run on site or does it run in the cloud like
[7003.64 --> 7009.24]  where's the processing actually handled they're like that all runs on site and i'm like oh okay so the
[7009.24 --> 7013.96]  thing is actually like it has the processing built in they're like yeah yeah it uses the x sensor and
[7013.96 --> 7020.68]  y sensor and whatever else i'm like okay great um but you said that the reconfiguring was done through
[7020.68 --> 7026.84]  the cloud and they're like yes and i'm like okay so in the event that you guys were to disappear for
[7026.84 --> 7033.08]  whatever reason would i be able to reconfigure it without your cloud service well we're not going to
[7033.08 --> 7039.64]  disappear and i go right but that isn't what i asked if you were to disappear would there be any
[7039.64 --> 7046.84]  way for me to reconfigure this myself like is there is there a web portal built into this unit that i can
[7046.84 --> 7052.52]  access through an ethernet jack or something um and they basically were like let me get back to you
[7052.52 --> 7058.20]  and i got an email back that was like you know based on your requirements i don't think we'll be able to
[7058.20 --> 7065.80]  move forward and i'm like based on my requirements i think you guys are idiots because you are selling
[7065.80 --> 7073.64]  what will effectively become a 60 70 000 paperweight in the event that yeah maybe you won't go out of
[7073.64 --> 7078.52]  business yeah they kept assuring me that their business was growing really well i'm like that's
[7078.52 --> 7087.48]  not my concern i'm concerned about this tens of thousands of dollars investment that i that that is
[7087.48 --> 7093.56]  just junk if you just arbitrarily decide at some point that you don't feel like supporting it
[7093.56 --> 7101.32]  anymore just unbelievable and it doesn't matter if they plan to be around what if they get acquired
[7102.28 --> 7107.40]  and whoever the new owner is wants to extract more value what if they decide to just brick them
[7108.92 --> 7117.24]  i just can't i just can't man yep yep that's pretty brutal yeah just frustrated
[7117.48 --> 7124.68]  we're not going to disappear a company doomed to fail andrew knowing yeah in full plane chat yeah
[7124.68 --> 7130.04]  exactly because this is the kind of thing that it's industrial equipment this is not something i
[7130.04 --> 7135.00]  expect to run for three or five so someone in full plane chat said 20 years down the road you could
[7135.00 --> 7142.28]  still be using it that's a long time yeah that's a freaking long time and you're not boeing no offense
[7142.28 --> 7151.96]  yeah right you're not ge no offense when you are ge i will still tell you to off because that is still
[7151.96 --> 7159.72]  stupid i just i can't i can't i can't handle it so like honestly and and that this is another crazy
[7159.72 --> 7167.96]  thing for 70 000 i mean could we make our own maybe actually there's yeah i mean because someone someone
[7167.96 --> 7173.88]  linked in flow plane chat yeah apparently there's this scrubber that's made by a youtuber and it's
[7173.88 --> 7178.52]  a scrubber that looks to be marketed towards people that have aircraft hangers
[7180.60 --> 7186.52]  okay best scrubbers because your hanger deserves it is the tagline okay hold on hanger scrubbers now
[7186.52 --> 7194.52]  just a second here um it looks like it's manually operated top oh yeah no but like if you took one of
[7194.52 --> 7199.16]  these things i'm sure you could convert it to not be manually oh interesting how much are these i have
[7199.16 --> 7207.40]  no idea there's a contact us button get good scrub yeah i think it's like give us a call type of
[7207.40 --> 7215.64]  situation yeah figures uh quick release squeegee vacuum protection and easy fill yeah and like it looks
[7215.64 --> 7221.48]  like like maintenance would probably have to be manual and like uh i am assuming like draining the tank
[7221.48 --> 7225.80]  and whatnot would have to be manual where i bet you with the other solution it would be automated
[7225.80 --> 7231.24]  and automating that part of this thing would probably not be very feasible yeah um so i don't know you're
[7231.24 --> 7239.72]  probably not going to be able to get the whole way there but yeah okay army of room buzz i was thinking
[7239.72 --> 7246.52]  like my my thing that does floor scrubbing yeah if you just had like i don't know 12 of them or something
[7246.52 --> 7250.84]  and you just zoned them all out so they just at a certain point in night they just all at the same time just
[7250.84 --> 7255.16]  like
[7255.80 --> 7261.00]  maybe i mean they they cycle their own water they do mopping like they do all this type of stuff
[7261.00 --> 7268.84]  exterminate you could at the price difference between the 70k for that yeah and whatever you'd
[7268.84 --> 7273.32]  have to pay for these things you could just have like three of them in the back just in case one dies
[7273.32 --> 7278.84]  um i don't know someone linked an auto scrubber
[7280.92 --> 7288.68]  yeah pacific floor care s28 disc 28 inch auto scrubber 15 000 i mean that seems pretty
[7288.68 --> 7295.96]  this looks like someone's pushing it yeah that's not the point yeah i wanted an autonomous one yeah
[7295.96 --> 7301.64]  yeah yeah it looks like a handle that's definitely a handle almost certainly a handle
[7302.60 --> 7310.36]  so anyway you know what i i guess we might just have to have mops or something but we'll figure it
[7310.36 --> 7315.72]  out walmart has automated versions i don't know if we decide to do an automated one then it'll definitely
[7315.72 --> 7322.76]  be a video so remember how i said hey forget about the automatic score keeping with the machine vision
[7322.76 --> 7330.28]  team we might need a machine vision team anyway for a floor scrubber for one floor scrubber that sounds
[7330.28 --> 7340.20]  so much less worth it like wow it sounds a lot easier like way easier can't you just put roomba brains in it
[7340.20 --> 7346.28]  like just rip the like motors out of a roomba and just glue it to the top of it it's way heavier yeah
[7346.28 --> 7352.20]  but it doesn't matter it's the same control system no i i no no i i see what luke's doing no we couldn't
[7352.20 --> 7359.72]  do that but that would be such a cool business for like roomba to expand into so you've got like you've
[7359.72 --> 7366.68]  got the dumb thing but then you just facility but you just get brains oh i see what you mean yeah yeah
[7366.68 --> 7374.28]  so they just so because yeah i i might want new sensors in a new brain but it's a freaking mop i i don't
[7374.28 --> 7379.88]  need i i i don't need a whole new body that would actually be like a modular approach to this could be
[7379.88 --> 7382.36]  kind of cool legitimately
[7385.64 --> 7392.36]  use a spot to do it it just walks out with an actual mop and bucket
[7392.36 --> 7402.12]  that would be amazing yeah instead of an arm on the top it's it's a mop yeah how much is this
[7402.12 --> 7411.96]  thing great idea oh man people are just linking me like random just like every push pusher no no this
[7411.96 --> 7418.52]  one this one looks to be actually automated oh okay um wow it's from karcher i had a pressure washer
[7418.52 --> 7425.08]  from them from costco that's all i know about them literally all oh it looks like you could push it
[7425.08 --> 7433.08]  i guess which is fine that's whatever this device requires instruction sure does request quote all of
[7433.08 --> 7437.88]  these things are request quote there's a video it's like it's a lot i want to see the video oh right i
[7437.88 --> 7442.68]  scroll through at the exact same time nice we can just skip it is a three minute video
[7442.68 --> 7451.80]  oh docking station wait wow no way no way what oh oh that's battery charging i thought that was
[7451.80 --> 7457.32]  like replacing fluid oh i'm sure it will oh shut up yeah no way okay that's awesome my little rumba
[7457.32 --> 7462.36]  thing does that well yeah but this goes right into the wall yeah yeah that'd be sick that would be
[7462.36 --> 7468.04]  kind of sick does it refill it tell me it refills it i hope so yeah wait wait it cleans the tank
[7468.04 --> 7473.32]  tank that's pretty cool okay how much does this karcher thing cost we don't know because it's
[7473.32 --> 7478.60]  request quote and do i need a subscription service for it do i have to configure it with their cloud
[7478.60 --> 7486.04]  there we go fills with fresh water oh this is kind of awesome i love the the the hydro physics they got
[7486.04 --> 7492.52]  going on all right okay all right yeah i'll find it takes off on its own i'll get in touch with these
[7492.52 --> 7497.72]  guys and figure out if they have uh if if this will be suitable for my needs you're going to turn
[7497.72 --> 7503.16]  this channel into an automated cleaning channel i know right that's the thing i love about ltt is you
[7503.16 --> 7508.04]  can kind of do you know whatever interesting things are interesting yeah interesting tech right yeah
[7509.96 --> 7517.80]  pre-sweep function pick up coarse dirt while scrubbing thank you little robot yeah i just hope it's
[7517.80 --> 7526.04]  actually any good it does detergent dosing that seems neat it has a warning beacon just in case
[7526.04 --> 7535.08]  it's going to roll over someone playing badminton wow and it dries yep it's probably drier
[7536.60 --> 7542.36]  there are options all right another thing if people want to just throw links at me like they currently
[7542.36 --> 7548.36]  are another thing that we're trying to figure out is how we want to do uh like memberships and uh
[7548.36 --> 7555.00]  court rentals and stuff like that and there's been a few there's been a few things that i've kind of
[7555.00 --> 7561.64]  found but i haven't found one that i think really fits perfectly yet so if you if you go to like a local
[7562.28 --> 7567.48]  court gym because i have found stuff for like weightlifting gyms but i guess we're going to need
[7567.48 --> 7573.56]  both at this point um but being able to rent specific courts and being able to rent like
[7573.56 --> 7579.16]  multiple courts at the same time um and also having your membership potentially play into that
[7579.16 --> 7583.16]  we don't know how that might work yet maybe you get a discount on court rental maybe something else i
[7583.16 --> 7589.24]  don't know um being able to have a membership on this other platform all of those types of things
[7589.24 --> 7596.28]  we want to ideally not make this stuff um court reserve for tennis boom this is why this is why
[7597.48 --> 7605.24]  court reserve court reserve court reservation software amazing i will look into this thank you
[7605.24 --> 7613.56]  people this is kind of cool apparently you teach it by just manually driving around the perimeter of
[7613.56 --> 7622.28]  the area you want it to clean but it has to be free of obstacles so i don't know how nets yeah
[7622.28 --> 7628.28]  would factor into that well we'll we'll figure this out yeah all right what else do you want to talk
[7628.28 --> 7636.28]  about anyway in conclusion fossil bad yeah oh my god you're talking about watches yeah yep
[7640.44 --> 7647.24]  uh chinese company releases new cpu yeah uh pictures courtesy of tom's hardware here
[7647.24 --> 7653.00]  chinese company power leader has announced they will be entering the cpu market and unveiled their
[7653.00 --> 7665.96]  new chip the power star p3-01105 an obvious rebranding of the i3-10105
[7667.80 --> 7674.84]  power leader claims the cpu uses storm core architecture and made no mention of intel whatsoever
[7674.84 --> 7682.76]  the company claims the cpu will be launching soon with an annual target of 1.5 million units sold
[7685.40 --> 7691.00]  we don't actually know anything more about it than this and our hope was that we could generate a bit
[7691.00 --> 7696.60]  of discussion with you guys about how the heck power leader might be getting a hold of one and a half
[7696.60 --> 7702.68]  million chips to rebrand um and what exactly it is that they're trying to achieve here
[7702.68 --> 7716.92]  what is going on oh hello my wife um do you want to come say hi to wancho you never say hi to wancho how
[7716.92 --> 7722.20]  come how come you're so how come you're so shy no i'm gonna make you come say hi to wancho
[7722.76 --> 7725.88]  to get the key if you want the key you have to come say hi to wancho
[7729.00 --> 7732.68]  yeah you can go home you can go home after you say hi to wancho
[7733.32 --> 7735.32]  i'm gonna hold it over here wow
[7735.32 --> 7746.12]  all right
[7747.48 --> 7752.60]  what else do we want to talk about oh yeah yeah right right right oh you guys um
[7753.64 --> 7758.68]  do they have one and a half million compatible motherboards and ram sticks i i don't know okay you
[7758.68 --> 7765.32]  guys haven't um really given us anything here man it would be really funny if they were just like
[7765.32 --> 7771.16]  uh yeah it just works with uh these boards just the pre-existing intel chip set i don't know people are
[7771.16 --> 7777.96]  speculating like factory defect cpus but those would never leave intel's factory which isn't in china
[7777.96 --> 7783.24]  so it's not like oh yeah it's like a third shift thing or a fourth shift or whatever it's called when
[7783.24 --> 7789.56]  the the factory like runs an additional shift and just you know puts it into a truck and you can buy
[7789.56 --> 7794.76]  the literally the exact same product that came out of the same factory but at a tenth of the price or
[7794.76 --> 7799.64]  whatever this this is obviously not that some people are saying from the e-waste bin well right but
[7799.64 --> 7803.32]  people would get wise and stop buying them before they managed to sell a million and a half
[7803.88 --> 7812.52]  like come on guys give me give me something here did they take over a boat like if so intel would have
[7812.52 --> 7817.16]  reported a million and a half cpus missing like that would show up on their balance sheet that would
[7817.16 --> 7823.64]  be on a quarterly earnings call like where are these coming from yeah that's not the that's not
[7823.64 --> 7832.60]  the question sec it guy it's it's where is it coming from my guess is closed factory revoked factory
[7832.60 --> 7838.68]  contract kept it running no that's not how intel works intel's a first-party manufacturer they make their
[7838.68 --> 7845.48]  cpus there's no third-party contractor that is just you know quietly moving cpus out the door
[7845.48 --> 7851.00]  people do steal cpus off the line you do see that from time to time especially with qualifying samples
[7851.00 --> 7857.88]  engineering samples you'll see a lot of that stuff show up but in terms of retail chips
[7859.32 --> 7866.28]  that's not really a thing linus didn't you know intel has a franchise program okay all right you guys are
[7866.28 --> 7874.92]  just you guys are just teasing now um i mean we've got some people sort of speculating that it could be
[7874.92 --> 7882.28]  political i mean there there has been the uh there has been the whole back and forth over just the
[7882.28 --> 7886.76]  semiconductor industry in general between the us and china there was that whole thing earlier this week
[7886.76 --> 7894.12]  where like there was speculation that the us would rather blow up tsmc than let china have it which is bad
[7894.12 --> 7898.28]  um by the way just sort of want to make my position clear on that
[7900.92 --> 7908.36]  simple answer they're lying but like to what end what's the what's the point of lying about this
[7909.16 --> 7914.52]  like it just looks ah yeah i don't i just don't get this
[7914.52 --> 7926.04]  images of hoax yeah okay well we don't know nobody yeah nobody seems to have a clear idea of
[7926.04 --> 7931.96]  what exactly the crap is going on here i thought maybe someone i thought maybe someone knew okay
[7933.64 --> 7942.52]  all right cool what else you want to talk about i need to do this really quick oh all right um oh and
[7942.52 --> 7946.52]  then i'm down to talk about whatever i want to talk about the six hundred and fifteen thousand
[7946.52 --> 7954.04]  dollars in penalties for companies that faked anti-net neutrality comments yeah what's going on with
[7954.04 --> 7967.16]  that okay this is wild this is like some next level bs this explains not all but at least some of how
[7967.16 --> 7971.96]  the two of the things that are going on with that is going to be a good thing that's going to be
[7971.96 --> 7974.04]  a good thing to do so i'm going to talk about how obviously beneficial things like net neutrality like right
[7974.04 --> 7980.60]  to repair don't just immediately happen where everyone just goes oh yeah that would be good let's do that
[7981.64 --> 7988.44]  let's talk about this three companies lcx digital media lead id and efficient
[7989.00 --> 7996.84]  i ff icint inc were hired by the broadband industry to enroll consumers in a campaign to repeal
[7996.84 --> 8005.40]  net neutrality rules in 2017. instead these companies submitted a combined 3.8 million fake
[8005.40 --> 8011.08]  responses to the fcc using the identities and personal information of real people without their
[8011.08 --> 8021.88]  knowledge or consent so basically if you were actually a real person who got convinced somehow
[8021.88 --> 8030.44]  that net neutrality was a bad idea and was bad congratulations you played yourself you are as
[8030.44 --> 8040.20]  clever as a bot like it's net neutrality is obvious it is obvious that it needs to be a thing um
[8041.24 --> 8046.52]  and because it's so obvious these companies clearly thought you know what we are never going to convince
[8046.52 --> 8050.92]  enough people of this yeah so we just need to fake it so we just need to fake it these companies have
[8050.92 --> 8058.20]  agreed to pay a total of 615 000 worth of penalties so this is just over six dollars per false representation
[8058.76 --> 8065.00]  wait no that doesn't seem right 3.8 million fake responses okay forget that math um they were not the
[8065.00 --> 8069.24]  only companies involved and this is actually the second batch of penalty agreements secured by the new
[8069.24 --> 8074.76]  new york attorney general uh these allegations first came to light in 2021 but the head of the fcc at the
[8074.76 --> 8084.12]  time ajit pi was anti-net neutrality and fought attempts to investigate he was awful like the worst yep
[8085.00 --> 8092.04]  like actually just paid chill yep authorities were unable to substantiate that the big isps who paid for
[8092.04 --> 8096.68]  these fake comments had direct knowledge of the fraud and thus they have not been held liable
[8098.92 --> 8108.44]  600 and 615 000 feels very low that's like cost of doing business yep this is disgusting these
[8108.44 --> 8117.32]  companies shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore in my opinion force closed what's that i don't think
[8117.32 --> 8123.72]  these companies should be allowed to exist anymore yeah i mean i i don't i just don't understand why
[8123.72 --> 8131.40]  you can have like however many grams of weed or whatever and in jail go to jail yeah like
[8134.04 --> 8142.60]  just fraud that's not a big deal yeah what yeah like the like the amount of the amount of money that
[8142.60 --> 8148.68]  was at stake oh in this net neutrality oh yeah in this net neutrality argument and like what are they
[8148.68 --> 8155.64]  going to overturn it now yeah this is hilarious lapsed memory goes the worst part is that this was
[8155.64 --> 8161.24]  known while it was happening yeah he specifically blocked any investigation yeah exactly yeah yeah we
[8161.24 --> 8166.20]  got people talking about like 650 grand is less than what some companies will pay for like a tv advertising
[8166.20 --> 8175.16]  spot yeah think about super bowl spots yeah like man yeah and 600k between three companies like okay
[8179.80 --> 8184.44]  yeah a hunter liar is saying in my state anything over an ounce is punishable by up to 20 years and
[8184.44 --> 8191.72]  it's disgusting yeah 100 like why is white collar crime just fine it's okay isn't elizabeth holmes like
[8191.72 --> 8203.32]  still not in jail who's that uh the um theranos oh really she's not i thought she was has avoided
[8203.32 --> 8207.96]  starting her more than 11 year prison sentence on thursday by deploying the same legal maneuver that
[8207.96 --> 8212.36]  enabled her co-conspirator in the blood testing hoax to remain free for an additional month
[8212.36 --> 8222.12]  okay because that would be an option if you had you know an ounce of weed in your bag
[8228.12 --> 8237.96]  anyways let's move on i want to talk about the blink update ltt yeah currently in second place doing
[8237.96 --> 8245.64]  good but but but we will likely lose that spot when the next two projects come online so if you
[8245.64 --> 8252.92]  guys want to join our boink team uh we are currently behind a non-tech uh signups are open for prizes uh
[8252.92 --> 8257.80]  would be majorly more people would be appreciated uh we need people running number fields at home and
[8257.80 --> 8263.48]  einstein at home so uh go go go check it out guys you can get more information hopefully at the link below
[8263.48 --> 8268.04]  do we have a link below to that dan uh hopefully we do otherwise i check it out on the forum you guys
[8268.04 --> 8273.48]  can learn more there and i think that's pretty much it for the topics should we switch over to when
[8273.48 --> 8278.44]  show after dark yeah dropped my fidget toy
[8282.12 --> 8283.48]  how are your fingers doing over there dan
[8285.72 --> 8292.12]  painful fingers my my fingers are painful my fingers hurt well now your back's gonna hurt because
[8292.12 --> 8297.64]  you just pulled landscaping duty it's a line from happy gill martins i can't take credit for that
[8298.20 --> 8301.96]  okay ben stiller in that movie is freaking hilarious that's pretty great
[8305.72 --> 8306.12]  okay
[8310.44 --> 8311.72]  let's go let's go
[8311.72 --> 8319.32]  wow
[8320.04 --> 8326.52]  i'm muted uh when you were leading a team of house painters how did you wow customers and manage
[8326.52 --> 8332.28]  quality any stories from that era uh he's starting his own painting franchise six months ago with five
[8332.28 --> 8332.68]  painters
[8335.24 --> 8341.56]  how did you wow customers i mean really i don't know that i ever
[8341.56 --> 8353.00]  wowed anyone uh we obviously did our best and you know cared about quality um i didn't have a huge
[8353.00 --> 8358.36]  team the biggest my team ever was was me plus two so i ended up doing a lot more of the painting myself
[8358.36 --> 8368.20]  than i was supposed to i wasn't a particularly good manager um so i was there on site most of the
[8368.20 --> 8376.20]  time unless i was doing quotes so managing quality was fairly easy in terms of how to wow people i mean
[8376.20 --> 8385.64]  honestly speaking from both sides i'd say that if you're a contractor who shows up within an hour of when you say you will
[8386.20 --> 8394.76]  you're gonna wow the customer uh that's like wow if you don't do like a terrible job yeah i had a guy um
[8394.76 --> 8400.60]  um we just kind of gave up on ever getting around to moving the trampoline from the old place to the
[8400.60 --> 8407.64]  new place and uh yvonne found a guy on facebook marketplace who does it for like 200 bucks or
[8407.64 --> 8412.12]  something like that and she was like you know what i'm just gonna do this so that uh you know one of
[8412.12 --> 8416.36]  the kids has a birthday party coming up so they can all jump and like i was not gonna have an opportunity
[8416.36 --> 8424.60]  to get it done and guy showed up and did it at the agreed rate and i tipped him like 50 bucks or
[8424.60 --> 8429.24]  something like that because wow i couldn't believe it you actually did it
[8433.48 --> 8435.00]  i still don't have a pool
[8438.28 --> 8443.32]  you're gonna have us roll the trampoline down the street weren't you yeah that was my that was my plan
[8443.32 --> 8449.96]  yeah i wasn't actually gonna recruit you but i was gonna have luke help me yeah i probably would
[8449.96 --> 8453.72]  have been there the return of channel super fun elias and luke try to roll a trampoline
[8454.68 --> 8459.08]  i wanted to do it in the snow because i figured when we're going down the hill we could just kind of
[8460.68 --> 8463.16]  slide it that would have actually been so much fun
[8465.96 --> 8472.36]  oh man okay that's so good hey ld recently started a new job with much
[8472.36 --> 8477.64]  more leeway for my own decision making leaving behind a job where i was micromanaged
[8477.64 --> 8481.40]  any advice for adjusting to this change finding myself struggling
[8486.44 --> 8490.28]  you have to make decisions you're going to make wrong decisions sometimes
[8491.32 --> 8497.56]  uh have reasons for why you made your decision like if someone's like this went really poorly why
[8497.56 --> 8502.68]  did you do this be able to justify it and be like yeah i mean now that we've seen it gone poorly it
[8502.68 --> 8508.60]  makes sense but when i was originally making the decision this is why i made it and you know if if
[8508.60 --> 8513.08]  i didn't have the information of this going poorly and i went back to it and i had this original
[8513.08 --> 8517.80]  information i would still make that decision if you can defend it to that level then like it is what it
[8517.80 --> 8522.76]  is you just got to keep moving but yeah understand that you're going to make mistakes and now they're going
[8522.76 --> 8530.60]  to be on you and that's okay hi peeps was looking for a video of yours from 2019 christmas buyer's
[8530.60 --> 8536.60]  guide i believe uh made my first computer with that can't find it anywhere is it common for you to
[8536.60 --> 8545.96]  delete old videos no it's very uncommon for us to delete old videos i think only a handful of actually
[8545.96 --> 8553.08]  published videos have ever been deleted one of them included a detailed floor plan of my old house
[8553.08 --> 8562.44]  for example that just kind of seemed ill-advised um what else yeah really not much
[8565.00 --> 8571.80]  uh oh oh we uh we pulled that uh see i don't even remember that that uh health monitoring ring
[8571.80 --> 8580.68]  ara ura ara or uh uh we we pulled the video when they were all miffed about it um and we
[8580.68 --> 8585.40]  offered to make good and they weren't happy with it and we were like oh okay so i think they wanted
[8585.40 --> 8590.44]  to pull i don't i i can't even remember exactly what happened but basically i i don't think it was
[8590.44 --> 8595.72]  really anyone's fault it just didn't work out so we pulled the video really really not many it's very
[8595.72 --> 8600.84]  uncommon yeah if you can't find it it's more likely that you just can't find it yeah the title is
[8600.84 --> 8605.00]  something different or whatever there's like 4 000 videos on the ltd channel or something like that
[8605.00 --> 8609.32]  like it's not yeah it's not a surprise that it's like hard to track down a particular one
[8611.64 --> 8617.56]  okay let's see oh should i done that hey dll long time watcher first time caller i'm going to be
[8617.56 --> 8623.64]  wrapping up my first ever custom hardline water cooling build in the next couple of weeks any chance
[8623.64 --> 8634.44]  of a new review my build soon oh interesting yeah i mean we we we ask people to submit bad builds but
[8634.44 --> 8640.84]  i guess we've never actually asked the communities to submit their best builds maybe we should do that
[8640.84 --> 8647.40]  we used to do well no we used to do that on way show actually that's true super long time ago build of the
[8647.40 --> 8656.68]  week was a thing yeah huh yeah maybe it's a maybe it's a potential idea for the reaction channel yeah
[8656.68 --> 8658.04]  reaction channel yeah
[8660.76 --> 8667.16]  hi lld i love listening to you guys on saturdays when i'm out delivering mail my pc is 20 feet away
[8667.16 --> 8674.60]  from the tv in my living room what is the easiest option to use my pc on my tv 20 foot hdmi cable uh yeah
[8674.60 --> 8678.84]  pretty much you might need to go optical especially if you're running hdmi 2.1 at that kind of a
[8678.84 --> 8686.20]  distance but i would i would personally just go with an active usb cable you might be able to do 20
[8686.20 --> 8693.00]  feet if you're just doing usb 2 and then a powered hub so that you can run mouse and keyboard or you know
[8693.00 --> 8700.36]  a mouse and uh game controller uh receiver you know whatever um and then i would yeah i would go with
[8700.36 --> 8705.96]  probably an optical hdmi 2.1 cable assuming you want to do like 4k 120 hertz or something like that
[8705.96 --> 8711.64]  uh by the way we missed a topic that is actually kind of a big one the we could just do this real
[8711.64 --> 8718.60]  quick here but the former uber cso was found guilty of concealing a data breach and something something
[8718.60 --> 8725.96]  basically six years in prison i think i thought we talked about this last week no i don't think we did
[8725.96 --> 8737.16]  oh okay um yeah but basically covered up a 2016 hack that compromised the data 57 million users
[8737.16 --> 8743.72]  including 600 000 driver's licenses yikes that's really rough uh so they withheld information about
[8743.72 --> 8749.40]  the incident and it was only investigated and disclosed in late 2017 when uber became came under
[8749.40 --> 8755.88]  new management he actually got another security chief position in cloudflare uh in 2018 only
[8755.88 --> 8761.32]  stepping down in 2022 to prepare for his trial yikes that's brutal um
[8764.36 --> 8767.32]  yeah that's rough i'm surprised nothing here is going towards the company
[8769.56 --> 8771.80]  but it is what it is yeah
[8775.64 --> 8779.32]  all right dan hit me oh apparently we just mentioned it last week we didn't go into the topic
[8779.32 --> 8790.20]  back to curated despite early excitement i haven't seen much buzz around the win gpd4 lately how do you
[8790.20 --> 8796.60]  think it compares to the rog ally as a portable windows pc from your time with both other than price
[8797.72 --> 8807.64]  oh man price matters a lot and the hardware in the ally is a lot faster um the the smaller brands the gpd's the
[8807.64 --> 8815.32]  ioneos the onex players of the world they've got it they're gonna have to have 7000 series ryzen in order to compete with
[8816.28 --> 8823.32]  what asus is doing with the ally and with what valve is doing with the steam deck quite frankly even though that's even older hardware
[8823.32 --> 8831.24]  as we found in our review of the ally it still performs surprisingly well especially in lower power envelopes
[8831.24 --> 8837.96]  and you've got to imagine that a big part of that is thanks to um the optimizations that valve is able to make
[8837.96 --> 8847.00]  by just baking their own os taking their time working through the problems and really squeezing the most
[8847.00 --> 8854.84]  out of that hardware something that we didn't touch on like did not um hit in our review and should have
[8854.84 --> 8862.92]  is the differences between sleep on windows and on the steam deck just instant sleep instant wake it's
[8862.92 --> 8869.80]  a more a more console like experience is much more seamless on the steam deck whereas on windows it's
[8869.80 --> 8876.52]  like rough get it yeah yeah exactly you're not really able to suspend it in the same way
[8876.52 --> 8886.20]  with more employees in the labs building how many times per hour are people and equipment moving back
[8886.20 --> 8890.92]  and forth are you going to have to hire someone just to drive a truck between the buildings i mean oh
[8890.92 --> 8896.04]  you mean between buildings i thought you just mentioned inside the lab we we work in a hallway god
[8897.24 --> 8900.68]  there's a lot of people that work there you start to realize that when you work in a hallway
[8900.68 --> 8905.24]  um yeah like five percent of the people you recognize and it's it's fantastic when when people
[8905.24 --> 8910.52]  decide to have impromptu meetings in the middle of our hallway um it's not that bad i'm just complaining
[8911.08 --> 8917.08]  uh yeah i don't know i don't see it often personally like needing to get things between the buildings
[8917.08 --> 8922.28]  the only thing i normally need to get between the buildings is myself um so i don't not a very
[8922.28 --> 8927.88]  good person to answer this but from from my observation point it's really not that bad
[8930.68 --> 8938.76]  was there any lifespan testing on the stick locks um i mean they're made of a very durable silicone
[8938.76 --> 8946.28]  rubber tell you what if they fail i got you sorry that's not what it is trust me bro that's the one
[8947.16 --> 8954.28]  that would be good on a shirt i recently saw a video about linking jet gpt to home assistant it can't
[8954.28 --> 8960.52]  control anything yet but it's only a matter of time linus would you trust an lm ll
[8960.52 --> 8968.76]  m ai with keys to your home automation well it depends right um because as long as it's
[8969.72 --> 8979.16]  oh yeah so hold on a second no i don't want anything that is web-based you can self-host oh
[8979.96 --> 8986.20]  but you can self-host chat gpt not chat forms of it but there are there are multiple forms of it okay
[8986.20 --> 8991.24]  so i was specifically responding to chat gpt but if we're just talking about in general and llm yeah
[8991.24 --> 8995.88]  i don't see why not as long as i'm self-hosting it as long as i'm the one who controls who is
[8995.88 --> 9001.72]  allowed to interface with it i mean it's not actually sentient i think decisions i was going to say i
[9001.72 --> 9007.48]  think what the the the merch message is asking is like are you going to trust it to not like i can't
[9007.48 --> 9017.48]  let you do that dave to your house yeah i'm not worried about that yeah yeah linus do you ever
[9017.48 --> 9023.88]  troll your family with automation my wife will leave every light in the house on when she does
[9023.88 --> 9028.60]  every speaker plays the song every light in the house she hates country um
[9028.60 --> 9038.76]  i like staying in my marriage for the most part that's actually hilarious i mean it's so funny
[9039.32 --> 9043.72]  oh my goodness you say that but then what was that like when she came to pick up the key oh yeah
[9043.72 --> 9048.52]  it's just bugging her okay oh no he troll he troll he trolls his family why not use your house all the
[9048.52 --> 9054.60]  time yeah i all the time i don't know if i've ever really done it you know what i would say that the
[9054.60 --> 9060.76]  very installation of smart switches is trolling my wife at this point yeah the fact that they are
[9060.76 --> 9067.00]  still in the house and you know not all working properly because i think it's something to do with
[9067.00 --> 9074.28]  just how much communication those particular switches spam out onto the network um the controller just gets
[9074.28 --> 9078.92]  overwhelmed i think we've kind of narrowed it narrowed down what the problem is they just can't handle such
[9078.92 --> 9085.16]  a big install um she's not happy so you know what once i've got everything set up if those new
[9085.16 --> 9093.32]  innavelli ones work out great yeah maybe but for now no i don't have a death wish or at least i don't
[9093.32 --> 9100.04]  wish to sleep in the guest room on the couch yeah yeah yeah what is the next big step in the lab
[9100.04 --> 9105.00]  what are you most excited about getting from the lab the most exciting thing for me that i expect to
[9105.00 --> 9117.88]  get from the lab is way more roundups like who wants a review of the evga b450 watt semi-modular
[9118.76 --> 9126.12]  no no i want to know what the best power supply under 35 is that's what i that's all i actually care
[9126.12 --> 9134.84]  about and so once we're doing once we're testing in bulk i want to do way more content like that what is
[9134.84 --> 9143.32]  the best sounding true wireless earphone just everything else aside we can we'll talk about that other stuff
[9143.32 --> 9150.76]  but give me a headline and give me real data to back it up i don't want just like bs listicles you know
[9150.76 --> 9156.92]  yeah really excited about that and the psu tester being online is definitely something i'm super excited
[9156.92 --> 9161.00]  about we're actually going to be shooting a lab update on monday uh we're going to be we've actually
[9161.00 --> 9166.28]  printed things with the metal 3d printer now so i'll be showing you guys some some print results
[9166.28 --> 9172.12]  um we've got the power supply tester uh the rf chamber uh the floor is in so at the end of the
[9172.12 --> 9176.92]  rf chamber video the floor wasn't actually in because we we wanted to shoot while they were installing
[9176.92 --> 9181.88]  so we could give you guys a better look at how it was going together um so you're going to see
[9181.88 --> 9185.16]  in the lab update we've got the floor and now we're going to talk a little bit more about the
[9185.16 --> 9188.76]  cellular network testing gear that we're going to be putting in there rf chamber is super cool man
[9188.76 --> 9197.16]  you want to know something wild you know how in science class you learn that just you know a metal
[9197.64 --> 9203.32]  enclosure is a faraday cage yeah well not all faraday cages are created equal like you know how
[9203.32 --> 9207.96]  you can put your cell phone in the microwave and you'll still get a text even though it's a faraday
[9207.96 --> 9215.88]  cave but but that faraday cage is designed for a particular um yeah i guess how would i even
[9215.88 --> 9221.72]  describe this like particular type of radiation yeah um and it's it's not perfect for everything
[9221.72 --> 9229.56]  and so what's really cool is the the man the precision with which they have to be built just
[9230.36 --> 9236.04]  mind-blowing uh there's this there's this like baffle this like pass-through that's designed for
[9236.04 --> 9242.12]  you to put your optical cables through so that you can actually get data inside it right and it's
[9242.12 --> 9248.52]  engineered so tightly that if you take just like a wire and just stick it through it the background
[9248.52 --> 9255.00]  noise goes from like minus 150 don't quote me on these numbers you'll see it in the video like minus
[9255.00 --> 9262.12]  150 db to like set minus 70. yeah like huge huge difference just from putting a wire through a hole
[9262.12 --> 9268.76]  in this whole room that we're in absolutely mind-blowing it's so cool yeah yeah we are going to be able to test
[9268.76 --> 9274.44]  some cool stuff though man the i'm very excited to throw my phone at it i already talked to them
[9274.44 --> 9286.20]  about it like the wi-fi the wi-fi router market has had what for objective testing yeah what what
[9286.20 --> 9292.84]  freaking wi-fi access point do you buy yeah i don't know who knows he's reading on a spec sheet and hoping
[9292.84 --> 9307.40]  hey lld i worked for zeku the in-house chip company for oppo is it ziku or zeku i'm not sure i don't
[9307.40 --> 9313.48]  think it matters anymore let's do both ziku just closed yesterday without any warning why do you
[9313.48 --> 9319.64]  think oppo chose now to leave the custom chip race we have produced two working chips honestly for me the
[9319.64 --> 9326.04]  bigger question is why they thought they should enter the custom chip race it's really challenging
[9326.04 --> 9335.88]  um and there's a reason that there's only i mean what i guess we could say apple uh qualcomm um
[9336.92 --> 9342.52]  media tech actually has some decent designs these days don't they but there's there's only there's only
[9342.52 --> 9349.16]  a handful of you know really successful arm integrators and the ones that are successful
[9349.16 --> 9354.84]  these days are adding a lot of special sauce to their designs making them very custom rather than just
[9355.48 --> 9362.28]  you know taking arm core ip and you know putting it onto a cpu if you want to be competitive
[9363.80 --> 9365.88]  uh yeah google google's another one
[9365.88 --> 9373.96]  it's really tough and i don't i don't see a company like oppo even at their scale
[9374.84 --> 9380.76]  i don't see it making sense for them to try to to try to develop their own chip ip i don't i don't get
[9380.76 --> 9393.64]  it it's just it's so hard okay last curated one i've got here hi wang.dll when looking at channel
[9393.64 --> 9398.52]  metrics how do you take into account users that lie about their age old account created while
[9398.52 --> 9404.92]  underage currently underage privacy or humor reasons we can't we just assume that well okay
[9405.48 --> 9411.96]  well we can't uh google definitely has uh mechanisms in place to try to account for that
[9412.68 --> 9417.48]  they will they will profile you based on the kind of content that you look at and the kind of
[9417.48 --> 9424.28]  behavior that you exhibit but other than that i mean it's all just you know a best guess right
[9424.28 --> 9427.80]  it's a heck of a lot better than what we had before that's what's turned google into such an
[9427.80 --> 9433.40]  advertising juggernaut is you know newspapers and magazines were just guessing they don't actually know
[9433.40 --> 9439.08]  who's reading them i mean cosmo you know made a pretty educated guess that it's probably mostly women
[9439.08 --> 9445.08]  reading it but they couldn't actually verify that well in the same way google is making a pretty good
[9445.08 --> 9451.48]  guess that you know someone who self-identifies as a 45 year old man is probably a 45 year old man
[9451.48 --> 9458.12]  because who would lie about that do you want to be a 45 year old man not necessarily i think there's
[9458.12 --> 9463.16]  probably also a lot of habits with like if you're gonna lie about your age you're either gonna pick
[9463.16 --> 9471.08]  like a hundred or just barely acceptable because why bother scroll further yeah so like yeah i don't know
[9471.08 --> 9477.40]  okay that's all we got for curated right now let's go through some of these potentials
[9477.40 --> 9483.32]  that might be spicy yeah good luck everybody have fun thanks for championing consumer rights
[9484.12 --> 9490.12]  right to repair and calling out bad company behaviors why not call out valve more for doing
[9490.12 --> 9495.80]  some things like uh locking in proprietary modding and drm wasn't even sure they did that honestly
[9495.80 --> 9509.88]  um well drm isn't bad drm invasive drm or that compromises your privacy drm we're always online
[9509.88 --> 9518.92]  rootkits are bad right but drm is not inherently bad drm is like like should i also criticize walmart
[9518.92 --> 9525.64]  for having a security guard standing at the exit to you know check your receipt or costco sorry
[9526.04 --> 9531.64]  costco having someone standing at the exit to check your receipt that's kind of drm it's like it's
[9531.64 --> 9539.56]  anti-theft right like it's not um i think i think valve does enough things right that whether they deserve
[9539.56 --> 9545.64]  it or not they get a lot of free passes um the way that they turn a blind eye to skins gambling is
[9546.20 --> 9552.04]  absolutely the most egregious thing that they're engaging in for profit and just you know ethics be damned
[9552.04 --> 9557.88]  um yeah well that's also like that type of activity i know this is not exactly the same thing but that
[9557.88 --> 9565.88]  type of activity went from like like you could never talk about gambling in relation to sports the whole
[9565.88 --> 9571.64]  time i was growing up and now the like main advertisers of all of them are gambling websites
[9571.64 --> 9576.20]  yeah it's kind of wild right now like the the world just like gave up on gambling which is very
[9576.20 --> 9581.56]  interesting to me kind of depressing yeah uh people are saying yeah drm in theory isn't bad
[9581.56 --> 9588.76]  but um it precludes people running stuff wait it precludes people running stuff however they want
[9588.76 --> 9593.40]  it's all bad no i can't say that i actually agree uh someone said it's bad when it's no longer
[9593.40 --> 9597.88]  supported but my understanding is valve came out and basically said yeah we'll turn it all off if we
[9597.88 --> 9602.52]  ever close steam i don't know that that's actually in their user agreement i don't know how that works
[9602.52 --> 9607.96]  with third-party developers clearly steam has grown beyond valve's wildest dreams when they were
[9607.96 --> 9614.20]  first developing it i guess there's plenty of time for us to be outraged when that happens and it could
[9614.20 --> 9619.08]  happen like i have no idea what valve's ownership structure is does anybody know they're privately held
[9620.12 --> 9623.88]  presumably mr newell still owns a significant amount of it he's not getting any younger
[9624.84 --> 9631.96]  like when gabe newell dies does steam shut down i i actually don't it's not impossible i have no idea
[9631.96 --> 9639.48]  it's improbable highly but it is not impossible right like this is not a publicly held company
[9640.28 --> 9642.44]  there's no guarantee of continuity here
[9646.12 --> 9651.40]  we can all hope around it stands around for a little while i guess let's see i'll archive that one
[9652.04 --> 9658.04]  watching since 2015 and ltd helped me feel comfy switching jobs into the tech sector from teaching
[9658.04 --> 9662.76]  still dealing with imposter syndrome but curious what certifications or knowledge would lmg expect
[9662.76 --> 9664.20]  for a systems administrator
[9667.32 --> 9675.24]  you hired for it yeah i mean we we looked for like a bunch of different stuff um i i don't know if the
[9675.24 --> 9679.08]  listing is still up it's probably down now but we looked for a bunch of different stuff but kind of the
[9679.08 --> 9686.84]  main thing we were looking for which is pretty normal for us uh was experience or portfolio obviously you're not
[9686.84 --> 9691.56]  necessarily going to have an amazing portfolio for that position you might but i doubt it um i don't
[9691.56 --> 9698.44]  know how you'd like represent it very easily you could but yeah it would be kind of tough um but yeah we
[9698.44 --> 9704.76]  mostly looked for experience what have you worked with um we did consider a bunch of different certifications
[9704.76 --> 9711.00]  and stuff though but there's like there's so many that that specific space is just like
[9711.00 --> 9720.12]  absolutely covered with them um and most jobs will will list the ones they actually care about so i
[9720.12 --> 9721.88]  don't know i would just look into that
[9724.92 --> 9730.20]  oops we're all doing merch messages hi linus and luke grateful for you you have talked about missing
[9730.20 --> 9735.56]  features but have you come across any apps or creative solutions that have been fundamentally changing
[9735.56 --> 9736.92]  your daily routine for the better
[9740.60 --> 9741.64]  hmm um
[9744.44 --> 9748.52]  any apps or creative solutions that have fundamentally changed your daily routine for the better
[9749.48 --> 9755.96]  i mean reminders were a big thing for me when those showed up on smartphones the clock app yeah i
[9755.96 --> 9762.52]  mean you'll be set alarms i like the clock app that starts google routines at my alarm times
[9762.52 --> 9769.56]  turns on all my lights i have an app called food checklist um that is if maintained well which we
[9769.56 --> 9776.76]  do a pretty good job of kind of indispensable for uh shopping we don't track anything in our fridge on it
[9776.76 --> 9781.96]  you can but we don't just because the in and out is so fast it's been yeah we'd spend more time on our
[9781.96 --> 9790.44]  phones than actually like you know cooking uh but for the freezer it's great because before we were just
[9790.44 --> 9796.92]  just awful about you know buying some like pre-done meal thing dumping it in there not using it buying
[9796.92 --> 9802.68]  another one exactly exactly so our freezer would be full and we'd be like holy crap we have like
[9802.68 --> 9808.68]  nine of those pizza making kits why why have we not made pizza in the last six months it's ridiculous
[9808.68 --> 9814.76]  right um yeah everyone should make pizza once a month the the thing that actually triggered it i
[9814.76 --> 9821.40]  think is yvonne came back from costco with a two pack of cinnamon raisin bread while her parents
[9821.40 --> 9825.40]  also bought us a two pack of cinnamon raisin bread and i think there were already like five or six
[9825.40 --> 9830.28]  loaves in the freezer and i was like okay this is we need a solution can't continue yeah and it's
[9830.28 --> 9838.52]  partially my fault because i'm super bingy so i once ate an entire loaf of that in one sitting yeah one
[9838.52 --> 9844.52]  sitting and so when i'm at like my peak consumption of something you actually cannot keep it in stock in
[9844.52 --> 9851.16]  the house and then i'll just go cold on it and stop eating it and then if you just keep like dumbly
[9851.16 --> 9857.08]  buying one and i don't mean dumbly like like intelligence dumb like just kind of like autopilot
[9857.88 --> 9862.20]  buying them every time you go shopping which would have been a perfectly reasonable thing to do
[9862.20 --> 9867.48]  and it's gonna pile up you know and if you have no way of knowing what's in the freezer because
[9869.08 --> 9874.44]  okay you try having three kids and running a company and like every crap other thing that yvonne
[9874.44 --> 9879.56]  does um you know you you'd forget to check the freezer before you go shopping too
[9880.28 --> 9885.88]  it happens so yeah food checklist it's pretty kind of great um and i think it was a one-time
[9885.88 --> 9890.92]  lifetime purchase i don't think it's a subscription anymore they also have a subscription option obviously
[9890.92 --> 9898.04]  but i was like no that's stupid so i i bought the one-time thing hey ellenelle my wife and daughter
[9898.04 --> 9904.04]  are starting a youtube channel non-tech at what point in their subscriber ramp should they start
[9904.04 --> 9911.32]  to work with flowplane zero subscribers 1 000 10 000 more i'd say if it's any earlier than like a hundred
[9911.32 --> 9916.36]  or a couple hundred thousand it's probably not going to be very effective the thing is that you've got
[9916.36 --> 9921.64]  to build an audience before you can monetize an audience you actually cannot put the cart in front
[9921.64 --> 9928.28]  of the horse and you're only going to be able to monetize some percentage of that audience so you
[9928.28 --> 9934.68]  look at obviously it's not apples to apples because there are some subscribers to ltt channel that
[9934.68 --> 9940.12]  subscribed 12 years ago and probably haven't looked at the content in over a decade right so it's if i say
[9940.12 --> 9946.60]  okay yeah we have 15 million subscribers on youtube and we've only converted 42 000 of them to floatplane
[9946.60 --> 9950.76]  you can't look at that ratio and go oh well i'll probably have a similar level of success but you
[9950.76 --> 9960.76]  also can't ignore that right out of 15 million we've converted 42 000 now that's enough to really move the
[9960.76 --> 9969.48]  needle for us these days but at that ratio if you had one and a half million you might have 4 000.
[9969.48 --> 9976.20]  if you had half a million you might have like 1200 subscribers on something like a patreon or
[9976.20 --> 9982.28]  something like a float plane if you had a hundred thousand you might have so what's the what's the
[9982.28 --> 9989.08]  math here let's go down another fifth so you'll have like 230 people or whatever that works out to
[9989.08 --> 9993.16]  230 people at five dollars a month okay so maybe you're getting about a thousand dollars a month
[9993.72 --> 9998.52]  that's twelve thousand dollars a year if you were planning to live off of that that's going to be
[9998.52 --> 10004.84]  fairly challenging unless you live in the middle of like but nowhere and you know you are on a farm
[10004.84 --> 10009.40]  where you can grow your own food or something like i don't know like yeah farming content sure no problem
[10009.40 --> 10017.64]  let's go but the but the math right like it's in order for it to actually move the needle you've got to
[10017.64 --> 10026.04]  have a significant subscriber base people have gotten really offended when they'll have like 100
[10026.04 --> 10030.52]  subscribers and they'll ask about external platform funding and i'm like yeah i don't think it's a good
[10030.52 --> 10035.72]  idea right now and they won't this won't even be in like relation to float plane necessarily i'm like
[10035.72 --> 10040.36]  should i start a patreon i'm like probably not and they they get pissed and i'm like no it's not i'm not
[10040.36 --> 10046.52]  trying to belittle you have we've talked about this on wanshow before literally every single action you
[10046.52 --> 10054.92]  ever do has a that means you're not doing some other form of action and like no you shouldn't just
[10054.92 --> 10061.32]  like drown under this thought process forever but you should consider like is it worth my time to start
[10061.32 --> 10068.36]  and maintain this other thing when i am at this stage of my growth as a channel or whatever it is
[10068.36 --> 10076.04]  no work on just hard focusing on your main channel there are inflection points right once you get to
[10076.04 --> 10081.32]  a certain size it might be like man this is like working pretty good or whatever but like i could use
[10081.32 --> 10085.32]  a bit more cash because if i had a bit more cash i could bring on like another editor or something and
[10085.32 --> 10090.44]  by doing that i could use my time in other ways to do other stuff it's like okay now is the time it
[10090.44 --> 10095.88]  makes sense like yeah you you might hit those certain points where it becomes more or more worth
[10095.88 --> 10101.64]  it depending on what size you're at or or how hardcore your audience is there's channels that
[10101.64 --> 10107.72]  will perform extremely well on these types of platforms whatever they are um because they have
[10107.72 --> 10115.48]  niche heavily invested audiences yeah so even though their channel is like in quotes small they have a
[10115.48 --> 10119.80]  really intense following that is going to follow them and is going to financially support them and then
[10119.80 --> 10123.88]  but if you know that then that's great so your inflection point might be at a different spot
[10123.88 --> 10131.24]  than potentially someone else you will also see channels that are enormous and just cannot can
[10131.24 --> 10137.32]  convert no one yeah because all their followers are not going to put money behind their following no
[10137.32 --> 10142.84]  matter what happens or they're located in regions where that too that kind of disposable income is
[10142.84 --> 10149.64]  not feasible is not going to work yeah and that's fine uh but then you should also understand that like
[10149.80 --> 10153.88]  maybe it's it's still not worth it for you even if you are a really large channel if if your audience
[10153.88 --> 10158.36]  is not going to be able to have that funding power which is fine you just might want to do different
[10158.36 --> 10167.72]  things in order to to grow so yeah that's it it's not a slight is all i'm saying hi linus and welcome to the
[10167.72 --> 10174.52]  dan show i noticed you are a fan of taylor swift are you going for an era's tour concert i managed to get
[10174.52 --> 10179.88]  tickets on my girlfriend's birthday she's a big swifty i don't actually do too many concerts i um
[10180.60 --> 10188.28]  i am super introverted i know you can't tell because i'm a youtuber and i have kind of like a
[10188.28 --> 10194.44]  bombastic on-camera personality particularly for the pre-recorded stuff but i i don't i don't i don't
[10194.44 --> 10201.96]  like dancing in public i don't like uh like my way of enjoying music is to put in headphones or put on
[10201.96 --> 10209.08]  headphones something to do with headphones and um listen to it myself by myself
[10211.64 --> 10217.88]  like honestly the amount of social interaction that i have to do running a company and having a family
[10217.88 --> 10224.76]  is kind of all i can handle it's enough yeah yeah it's more than enough um i i think it'd be super cool
[10224.76 --> 10233.96]  to go to a taylor swift concert concert um but i yeah i'm oh man it's also like it's a lot of work
[10233.96 --> 10240.84]  like it takes hours like i had someone uh we actually sponsored a small badminton tournament
[10240.84 --> 10244.60]  it's like a thousand dollars or something like that like it wasn't it wasn't a huge amount or anything
[10244.60 --> 10251.08]  but um what was stupid about it was that i had a ton of people notice that we sponsored it and ask me
[10251.08 --> 10255.00]  about it because i know a ton of badminton people locally and they're like so you're playing right
[10255.00 --> 10259.88]  and i'm like no like you sponsored it i'm like yeah but it's like it's a double knockout tournament
[10260.44 --> 10268.76]  i'm not i'm not good enough to win it it's like an hour for me to drive there i'm gonna play at most
[10268.76 --> 10275.32]  two sets all right two matches so i will play for about they're probably going to be two sets to
[10275.32 --> 10281.24]  complete so i will play for at most about 30 minutes 40 minutes and then i will drive an hour
[10281.24 --> 10288.12]  home it's just oh right and making matters worse if you lose your first usually they run the winner
[10288.12 --> 10292.92]  bracket first and the consolation bracket after oh so you just have to wait so i'll be waiting so i'll
[10292.92 --> 10299.88]  get there i'll drive an hour i'll get there i'll play for like 30 minutes i'll get cold right i'll wait
[10299.88 --> 10306.36]  for three hours then i'll play again cold and probably lose because i suck and then i'll drive
[10306.36 --> 10312.52]  home for an hour it's like i i don't know it's not it's just not worth it like i have no problem
[10312.52 --> 10317.64]  supporting the event but i only play waterfall tournaments now because i just can't do you know
[10317.64 --> 10325.48]  do you know the waterfall format i believe so yeah so it guarantees at least three matches so also
[10325.48 --> 10333.00]  called abcd flight um and basically what it does is it takes the main draw and as soon as you lose
[10333.00 --> 10341.96]  you go to i believe if you lose first you go to uh c flight and then if you lose again you go to d
[10341.96 --> 10346.36]  flight and you compete there in a knockout tournament and then if you lose if you win your first but lose
[10346.36 --> 10352.84]  your second you go to b i think and then if you lose again you go to c i don't remember how it works but
[10352.84 --> 10358.68]  basically it's it's pretty cool and what it does is it makes it so that by the time you're in the right
[10358.68 --> 10367.00]  flight your matches should be really close and should be winnable but it requires an enormous draw
[10367.64 --> 10373.24]  to a ton of participation it requires way more court time because every player is guaranteed at least
[10373.24 --> 10379.72]  three matches and um it requires a huge facility because otherwise you can't run this enormous draw
[10379.72 --> 10383.16]  in parallel and people end up just like waiting around all day so people don't run them very often
[10385.72 --> 10391.16]  linus you've mentioned in a few videos that it's important to never insult your fans so what exactly
[10391.16 --> 10396.28]  was the trust me bro shirt then it felt very mocking love the show otherwise thanks
[10398.44 --> 10407.24]  um i don't know i guess from my point of view i um i didn't think too much of the wan show audience
[10407.24 --> 10412.12]  would be that off put by it and you know maybe i maybe that was a swing and a miss for me obviously
[10412.12 --> 10420.04]  right um you know i thought that i thought that my track record of taking care of things was pretty
[10420.04 --> 10425.80]  clear there were some things that i obviously didn't communicate very well like uh when i was
[10425.80 --> 10430.04]  talking about like the number the the way that people misinterpreted what i was talking about with
[10430.04 --> 10435.24]  respect to like the warranty liability for like my family if i passed away or something like that i wasn't
[10435.24 --> 10439.96]  actually concerned about the warranty liability what i was concerned about was us coming up with a
[10439.96 --> 10445.48]  policy that made sense and was something that we could follow through on no matter no matter what
[10445.48 --> 10450.60]  and figuring out what mechanisms we needed in place so what would that look like well planning
[10450.60 --> 10455.80]  for the worst case scenario like in the event of my death or something like that uh would that look
[10455.80 --> 10464.12]  like some kind of cache of backpacks and screwdrivers held by a third party in escrow or something like
[10464.12 --> 10471.72]  i don't know i just didn't know the solutions um you know as it was all people wanted was a piece of
[10471.72 --> 10475.72]  paper that said this like standard boilerplate thing and then the whole thing went away and i'm
[10475.72 --> 10481.32]  looking at it going that's meaningless you know that right and so yeah i thought it was kind of funny
[10481.32 --> 10488.52]  and i did a trust me bro shirt like at the end of the day all it came down to was my word
[10488.52 --> 10493.56]  that was all you have now that's all you ever had and that's all you're ever going to have because
[10493.56 --> 10498.04]  i'm the director and primary shareholder of this company so at the end of the day if i decided to
[10498.04 --> 10504.12]  fold up shop and not honor anything i could do that and so you guys either do trust me or you don't
[10505.00 --> 10509.64]  and it seems like for the most part you do thank you um but yeah the whole thing
[10509.64 --> 10518.12]  in retrospect i handled it extremely poorly and it just if it just felt kind of ridiculous to me the
[10518.12 --> 10524.92]  way that it the way that it blew up when at the end of the day nothing i ever said was actually
[10524.92 --> 10529.00]  incorrect it was just upsetting um
[10531.88 --> 10537.56]  sorry that's that's my canadian conclusion to the whole saga i guess
[10537.56 --> 10545.00]  okay let's get some more curated in here hello lld staying up late to watch you from the european
[10545.00 --> 10551.40]  union what's your take on user benchmark people will sometimes quote quote me they're insanely
[10551.40 --> 10563.08]  wrong comparisons and anti-amd propaganda that they take at face value yeah the lab is basically the lab's
[10563.08 --> 10569.56]  job is to make it so that sites like that don't exist anymore uh there's there's another one that
[10569.56 --> 10575.48]  every time i try to compare like some laptop gpu to something i always end up on this site and it's
[10575.48 --> 10580.76]  like worthless it actually has no useful information whatsoever i don't care how many stream processors
[10580.76 --> 10587.24]  it has how fast does it go and so the labs's goal is going to be to make a database that you can
[10587.24 --> 10594.76]  actually trust database of real data not just a base and that was based
[10597.08 --> 10601.80]  bonkers where's my bell i've had at least a couple bells today no you don't have to do it
[10602.92 --> 10607.96]  i've been slacking on the bell yeah it's fine you've replied to a lot of merch messages hey linus luke and
[10607.96 --> 10616.44]  dan luke i saw theo thanking uh talking about how you're a great developer manager this is this is
[10616.44 --> 10622.52]  positive great stop stop crying wow i started my job i'm not crying you're crying i started my job as a
[10622.52 --> 10626.52]  junior developer four months ago and i was wondering if you have any advice for devs starting out
[10628.44 --> 10637.32]  uh whoa that's really broad um wow i don't know wait he started a job is that what he said so he has a job
[10637.32 --> 10641.96]  yeah but they have a job yeah he's been a junior developer for four months okay been working for
[10641.96 --> 10653.72]  four months um i would check in with your leadership um yeah i would check in with your direct report
[10653.72 --> 10660.52]  and if there's a person above that that you are able to comfortably talk to about this stuff i would
[10660.52 --> 10669.64]  check in with them and just see what they think you could do better in order to advance um to not
[10669.64 --> 10673.16]  being a junior anymore and you've only been a junior for four months so you're like probably not that
[10673.16 --> 10681.24]  close so don't expect like oh it's gonna happen right now um but expect maybe some feedback of like
[10681.80 --> 10687.00]  basically ask them what it would take in their eyes for you to advance to the next level what you
[10687.00 --> 10692.36]  would need to be displaying consistently as a as a skill or or whatever else to be able to get there
[10692.92 --> 10698.68]  and work with them to to grow internally that's what i would suggest hold on tarfif 101 is still
[10698.68 --> 10703.16]  not getting the point over in float plane chat if you got to close the company to not honor the
[10703.16 --> 10708.60]  warranty versus just decide not to but stay open because there's no warranty then that's not the same
[10708.60 --> 10715.48]  one is better that's not what i said what i said was we would need systems in place to ensure that
[10715.48 --> 10720.60]  whatever we promised would be honored even if the company were closed that's what i said
[10721.72 --> 10727.40]  it was always trust me bro it was always we got this we were always gonna got this we were never
[10727.40 --> 10736.68]  trying to get out of anything i remember that era very precisely because i remember a plan that i had to
[10737.24 --> 10743.40]  try to come up with some kill switch where i could close your chat boxes because i was so tired of you
[10743.40 --> 10749.88]  reading chat and just like getting in fights with chat for entire streams there was like at least a
[10749.88 --> 10755.88]  month there where that was like all that happened i was like this is so annoying you're just getting
[10755.88 --> 10765.16]  baited into just everything but people still they're still like i i i'm not a perfect communicator i don't
[10765.16 --> 10770.52]  claim to be yeah maybe maybe maybe maybe i may you know what maybe we need to be under new management
[10770.52 --> 10775.32]  maybe they would do a better job maybe they wouldn't be reckless and die and then you wouldn't have to
[10775.32 --> 10784.68]  worry about your warranty badman related injury yeah whole company goes under yeah oh man i mean look you
[10784.68 --> 10789.88]  you can't just eat an entire loaf of bread like that and then go exercise you're gonna keel over
[10789.88 --> 10794.44]  that's how you get cramps that's what my stupid doctor said before i fired him
[10796.52 --> 10802.28]  it's raisins it's got raisins it's frozen it's fine we've there should there should be back and
[10802.28 --> 10807.08]  forth discourse so i want to i want to say that before i get into this i'm not saying people shouldn't
[10807.08 --> 10813.80]  be shouldn't be critical or constructive but it it ties somewhat into the same concept that i brought up
[10813.80 --> 10819.80]  a billion times about the blizzard press conferences yeah where like when people scream at the developers
[10819.80 --> 10826.28]  on stage because they say something that isn't pr great that all that's going to lean into is them
[10826.28 --> 10831.16]  not putting devs on stage anymore yeah and also we would have never had to do any of that stuff
[10831.16 --> 10836.76]  because shadow slayer puts this really well historically though not linus denying basically
[10836.76 --> 10843.16]  every warranty request is very viable as a scummy tactic we wouldn't have to do anything we would just
[10843.16 --> 10847.64]  have to just deny warranty requests it's that simple and whether you have a written one or not it
[10847.64 --> 10853.08]  doesn't really matter you could just deny it because pretty much every warranty has legalese
[10853.08 --> 10859.08]  cover your butt wording in it that allows you to just deny it at your sole discretion that's just
[10859.08 --> 10865.56]  that's that's that's that's like no company is going to go under over a warranty issue they will try to
[10865.56 --> 10872.60]  weasel out of it fortunately we're in a position where our primary business is not making products
[10872.60 --> 10879.32]  still our primary business is still creating content so we wouldn't go under that's why i said
[10879.32 --> 10886.44]  at the time if every single one of them got returned it would suck but it wouldn't kill us
[10887.40 --> 10892.84]  so we actually can afford like this is like how i've talked about why the warranty and service
[10892.84 --> 10898.76]  situation is so bad in the tech industry because the margins suck it's actually not sustainable to offer
[10898.76 --> 10905.40]  the kind of service that some other industries do like when you buy a a pair of you know let's just
[10905.40 --> 10910.68]  pick on someone that i consider to be kind of overpriced when you buy a pair of lululemon pants
[10910.68 --> 10917.72]  okay lululemon yoga pants those freaking things cost well yeah i expect a no questions asked warranty on
[10917.72 --> 10922.68]  this thing because you could have lit you could literally give me six of them for what i paid you
[10922.68 --> 10928.92]  yeah by the time you've given me three you're still laughing all the way to the bank right like
[10929.56 --> 10936.92]  of course they don't have that kind of margins in tech so they tend to behave very very differently so
[10936.92 --> 10941.72]  we're kind of more like a lululemon where we don't actually make our money selling you backpacks we
[10941.72 --> 10946.28]  certainly make money but that's not how we make our living i guess is what i should have said so we can
[10946.28 --> 10952.52]  afford to take back every backpack if we really needed to it's a very luxurious position because
[10953.24 --> 10958.52]  it allows us to behave in a way that's just not easy to compete with the trust me bro guarantee is
[10958.52 --> 10967.16]  freaking awesome we got you i mean don't be a jerk about it obviously but we got you yeah those
[10967.16 --> 10971.00]  customer support people are real people and they're nice people and they're cool people be nice to them
[10972.28 --> 10977.72]  i am never curating another merch message thank you thank you i have learned my lesson thank you we
[10977.72 --> 10982.36]  are moving on appreciate it for linus and luke what aspects of your job feel like work and when
[10982.36 --> 10988.28]  does it feel like you are being paid to have fun i mean really i think the most fun thing for me is
[10988.28 --> 10993.96]  talking about the trust me bro warranty i knew it i knew that was gonna happen i was gonna slip one
[10993.96 --> 10998.84]  into the merch message just to screw with luke's face that really is the best part i don't know who i
[10998.84 --> 11002.52]  should give it to do i upset luke or do i let linus upset luke i can never pick
[11005.72 --> 11015.64]  oh my god i just like oh man at this point it wasn't even recent like it's over oh now luke is doing it
[11015.64 --> 11022.28]  what's fun about your job is it this you don't seem to like this no i actually really like
[11022.92 --> 11028.52]  i don't i i barely consider wanshow work the only portion of wanshow that's work is i can't
[11028.52 --> 11034.52]  technically do other things because i do wanshow but like i enjoy doing wanshow i don't want to stop
[11034.52 --> 11038.68]  doing wanshow we've had this conversation before there have been points in time in the company's
[11038.68 --> 11048.52]  history where wanshow was an anchor a burden it was a huge waste of time um these days not so much
[11048.52 --> 11054.04]  it's doing a lot better but like there have been times where we're like wow uh if we look at this
[11054.04 --> 11059.88]  logically we should really not do this thing anymore yeah and we've kept it going because like it's just
[11059.88 --> 11066.12]  sort of cool i don't know um i don't think either of us have ever actually understood why people watch it
[11066.12 --> 11071.16]  but we like hosting it yeah it's fun i mean maybe that's why maybe that's why they like watching
[11071.16 --> 11080.68]  it maybe because okay yeah i figured it out i figured it out what well neither of us would watch
[11080.68 --> 11086.44]  wanshow because we don't have to watch wanshow to hang out i don't mind hanging out with you for three
[11086.44 --> 11095.88]  hours you no problem yeah so that's it okay so it's just like a hangout yeah but we don't but we can do
[11095.88 --> 11100.92]  it anytime we want we can just jump in discord but they can't so they watch wanshow fair enough
[11101.72 --> 11105.48]  okay yeah okay i think i finally get it that makes sense
[11107.72 --> 11113.32]  nice nice but yeah i don't know that stuff i there's a bunch of parts of my job that like
[11113.32 --> 11120.44]  yeah it obviously feels like a job but i enjoy it um i don't enjoy
[11120.44 --> 11130.44]  i enjoy making stuff or like my team making stuff if i want to be more accurate
[11130.92 --> 11136.12]  um i don't enjoy when those things have like
[11138.76 --> 11144.84]  hugely negative impacts on the company like if something that we do like goes down in a really bad
[11144.84 --> 11151.56]  way that sucks if it like kind of goes up in flames but we're still able to hold things together and
[11151.56 --> 11159.96]  we can push through and we make it roast super cool yeah but when things like actually just critical
[11159.96 --> 11167.56]  brutal fail in a way that like wrecks other people's jobs or days or whatever that's like a yeah that that
[11167.56 --> 11173.00]  kind of blows um but i mean yeah i think i think there's a lot of that around here i think by and large
[11173.00 --> 11177.16]  people care about the rest of the team so it's like yeah i don't think anyone wants to waste anybody
[11177.16 --> 11182.92]  else's day yeah i think that's pretty normal like i i don't it's a there was a bunch of this uh
[11182.92 --> 11188.60]  hmm i don't think this is a big deal there was a there was a decent amount of this in um when people
[11188.60 --> 11193.88]  talked about like what it's like working here right they were like yeah i think from the outside
[11193.88 --> 11199.88]  sometimes people forget that it's a job like it's a job you have to do job things you have to actually
[11199.88 --> 11205.72]  work yeah like remember that reddit post where the person was complaining about like having to work
[11205.72 --> 11210.76]  here essentially yeah they're like i didn't want to work when i showed up to work and it's like well
[11210.76 --> 11215.80]  like you have to work really hard yeah it's like yeah yep okay well if you can find someone who will
[11215.80 --> 11220.68]  pay you to hang out at a social club then by all means go do that congratulations i can't compete
[11220.68 --> 11226.36]  with that this ain't it i got bills to pay yeah this is this is more like i don't know we're we're uh
[11226.36 --> 11233.88]  we're more like dogs chasing cars like we're there's stuff to do yeah i don't know it was always
[11233.88 --> 11239.32]  going to be like that yeah uh tieback says i thought you guys weren't supposed to watch those videos
[11239.32 --> 11244.20]  that's me i can i'm not allowed to watch that's the only promise that i ever made is that i wouldn't
[11244.20 --> 11249.08]  watch it and i still haven't yeah i haven't and i don't think tons of people have said that all the
[11249.08 --> 11253.88]  time that isn't a spoiler i also didn't say who said it like it doesn't matter yeah well i never said
[11253.88 --> 11259.16]  i wouldn't incidentally come across information about it i just said that i will not watch it and
[11259.16 --> 11263.32]  he doesn't watch it yeah i have still haven't watched the first one i think what i said with
[11263.32 --> 11270.12]  the first one is when and if i step out of the company i'll watch it then so i'm gonna watch it
[11270.12 --> 11275.88]  someday but not while i'm still working here with the people who were interviewed i i didn't want to
[11277.00 --> 11281.24]  i don't even remember what i said i should go back and watch it i didn't want to influence the process
[11281.24 --> 11286.12]  i wanted to be as light touch as humanly possible on it because i wanted it to be
[11287.08 --> 11292.20]  actually interesting if i if i'm standing over people while they're answering that they're not
[11292.20 --> 11297.80]  going to behave naturally right i mean even even as it is like i'm sure people pulled their punches
[11297.80 --> 11301.88]  a little bit you should have seen but i hope not should have seen the stuff dan said about you dude
[11301.88 --> 11308.68]  oh really it was brutal he just he laid into you how bad was it dan it was uh it's pretty tight
[11308.68 --> 11315.32]  i never said i wouldn't ask people about it after i guess what's up dan you know uh i mean i had to go
[11315.32 --> 11320.28]  to the store and everything you had to go to the store yeah am i missing something i don't know who got
[11320.28 --> 11330.68]  the condoms it's mostly about the end of my uh my interview i i bought the cantaloupe for the prison
[11330.68 --> 11340.60]  phone video oh was that like on your first like i had not been working here long excuse me daniel we
[11340.60 --> 11346.04]  need you to go and purchase a cantaloupe well why is that sir we're gonna stick a phone in it for
[11346.04 --> 11354.84]  somebody's butt yeah already see you later dan bye um anywho that was i had no idea at all what you were
[11354.84 --> 11359.24]  talking about uh here's the latest float plane exclusives uh we've got dan front and center on
[11359.24 --> 11363.88]  both of them so if you guys were hoping for more we also have a float plane exclusive coming to the
[11363.88 --> 11369.00]  when uh about the wan show coming to float plane oh excellent yeah that's uh this is the place to
[11369.00 --> 11374.12]  get all the behind the scenes you can get extras from the interviews from what's it like working for
[11374.12 --> 11379.64]  lmg we've got a lot of those full interviews uh we've got cutting room floor from the build with my
[11379.64 --> 11386.52]  sister-in-law uh this is a cool series their first time yeah we've got sarah nick and colton up so far
[11386.52 --> 11392.04]  it's uh reacting to their first time on camera this is just a random behind the scenes compilation
[11392.04 --> 11400.20]  featuring uh i think dan's in it a bunch of people from the labs in it um yeah don't miss it float plane
[11400.20 --> 11405.08]  yeah yeah yeah yeah float plane hey any new beta site stuff to talk about uh we mostly just like
[11405.08 --> 11413.00]  fix stuff this week that makes sense yep that makes a lot of sense cool but we we pushed all
[11413.00 --> 11416.52]  the things we wanted to push yeah no no no no i'm dead i'm dead i'm not in it
[11420.52 --> 11426.52]  but that makes a lot of sense yeah yeah hey linus have you tried streaming your pc to your phone over
[11426.52 --> 11432.04]  4g as an alternative to buying an expensive handheld pc i've done it and looks good at five megabits
[11432.04 --> 11437.40]  connection uh considering how low that is and the screen size looks good latency sucks and we have
[11437.40 --> 11445.24]  a video on that remember the the diy thing yeah yeah the diy shield yeah yeah uh i don't think we
[11445.24 --> 11449.88]  did it over cellular data though i think that was probably not probably over wi-fi over cellular data
[11449.88 --> 11455.16]  i mean if you're playing a very sightseeing game sure you're not going to be playing any super meat boy
[11455.16 --> 11460.28]  though you play like vampire survivors or something you're gonna chew boy are you ever gonna chew
[11460.28 --> 11463.64]  through your data cap though wowie
[11466.76 --> 11473.16]  dear lld since the thumbnail for today is about shilling can we get some more merch options that
[11473.16 --> 11480.52]  are just big logos names shilling i know you aren't a fan but can you just make my can you just take my
[11480.52 --> 11487.64]  money anyway okay so that's uh wow you know what that actually ties into something we were talking about
[11487.64 --> 11494.60]  earlier the whole thing where i was saying that you have to reach a certain scale before like a
[11494.60 --> 11499.88]  patreon or a float plane type of monetization makes sense because you'll only be able to convert a certain
[11499.88 --> 11505.64]  percentage let's take that and let's apply it another step down so float plane has a very clear value add
[11505.64 --> 11512.76]  where occasionally we'll upload videos early particularly before weekends um we've got extra content like
[11512.76 --> 11521.08]  clearly if you're into the content you might be into the extra content um and it's got from my
[11521.08 --> 11526.28]  experience just a much more positive pleasant community vibe whether it's on the live chat during
[11526.28 --> 11530.76]  the wan show or even in the comments under the video so there's this really clear like value add
[11530.76 --> 11537.64]  and it's not just tangentially related it's directly related to our main product which is tech videos right
[11538.60 --> 11543.32]  so then there's your merch you're only going to convert a certain percentage of people to your
[11543.32 --> 11550.04]  your physical products um that's also kind of directly related to the main thing because we like
[11550.04 --> 11553.96]  build computers oh we have a screwdriver we carry laptops around okay we've got a backpack you know
[11553.96 --> 11560.76]  whatever stuff that just has your logo on it that doesn't necessarily serve a clear function and isn't
[11561.40 --> 11565.56]  necessarily directly related to the service that someone was already enjoying from you
[11565.56 --> 11571.96]  is going to be a much lower conversion rate it's like a conversion rate on a conversion rate
[11572.52 --> 11581.08]  and so if we were to make i don't know uh an ltt or a wan logo wall ornament or something like that
[11582.12 --> 11586.84]  first of all i won't release anything that's crap because i hate that right so it will have to be
[11586.84 --> 11592.60]  good which means we have to invest significant development time in it after we've done that we have
[11592.60 --> 11598.28]  to meet whatever bar there is for a minimum order quantity from whatever you know manufacturer or
[11598.28 --> 11605.48]  manufacturers that we are contracting to produce this product so let's say a thousand units or five
[11605.48 --> 11610.92]  thousand units i have no way of knowing exactly what that would be until we've made it significantly
[11610.92 --> 11619.16]  deeply into the development process at that point i've got to ask myself you know um what price do i need
[11619.16 --> 11624.12]  to sell this at now knowing it's going to be relatively low volume in order for me to make
[11624.12 --> 11628.60]  back what i spent on product development okay because it's going to be low volume that price is going to
[11628.60 --> 11637.48]  have to be higher okay where's the threshold where that high price goes from recouping cost to just like
[11639.08 --> 11646.60]  creating a perception of exploitation and and money grubbingness will people will people see that that
[11646.60 --> 11651.16]  nuance there where i kind of go look this isn't just money grubbing i actually do need my team to be
[11651.16 --> 11657.64]  paid for the development time so am i just hurting my own brand by selling branded stuff that we spent
[11657.64 --> 11661.64]  way too much time working on for a very niche audience maybe
[11665.56 --> 11671.96]  sometimes i can be really sometimes i just overthink this stuff though like the when we when we did that
[11671.96 --> 11677.80]  uh short-term relaunch of just the classic linus tech tips logo shirt it sold like crazy because
[11677.80 --> 11682.44]  people just wanted it i guess this is actually like legitimately one of my favorite shirts that's
[11682.44 --> 11686.76]  it that's ltx though that's an event shirt that's totally different yeah but i'll do an event one of
[11686.76 --> 11691.00]  the big reasons why i like it is just because it's just a little logo in the corner okay it feels kind
[11691.00 --> 11695.96]  of professional we have like we have a flag that's going to be there for ltx like just you know the ltx logo
[11695.96 --> 11702.52]  go on a flag for 2023 here um so i'm more willing to do that for like a commemorative you know item
[11702.52 --> 11709.16]  versus just our brand let's go um i don't know maybe maybe we'll do maybe we'll do more of it in
[11709.16 --> 11716.36]  the future maybe not we have a really cool thing coming though tell me something if you could own
[11717.24 --> 11719.24]  a solid aluminum keycap
[11719.24 --> 11724.12]  that is this big
[11728.12 --> 11729.32]  what would you pay for it
[11731.96 --> 11739.40]  solid aluminum chrome plated what it's mirror finish does it work no of course not you can't
[11739.40 --> 11743.64]  plug it in the question is that what do you mean it's this big do you know how much it freaking weighs
[11743.64 --> 11751.64]  like a bump no you couldn't yeah you could it it's solid aluminum yeah it'd be a bad idea so much
[11752.36 --> 11758.76]  there's no mechanism in it um and it's solid when i say solid i don't mean concave empty hollowed out
[11758.76 --> 11764.52]  i mean it is solid it's a brick i have no idea at all just
[11767.40 --> 11771.24]  i don't know it doesn't matter what you say because the people out there that want it they're
[11771.24 --> 11774.12]  going to pay any amount of money it doesn't yeah it doesn't really say yeah
[11777.48 --> 11781.32]  i don't know i'm just thinking about the shipping costs what's the there's some
[11781.32 --> 11787.16]  meme about a loch ness monster you give it four dollars and 69 cents or something i don't know
[11787.16 --> 11792.84]  i don't remember i have no idea no you give them about 350. yeah there you go that's it you get a
[11792.84 --> 11799.88]  double face palm there you go 350. yeah there you go there we go i want it i wanted like 350. i wanted
[11799.88 --> 11809.72]  linus to do the quote enough he still didn't there we go we got there anyway i have no idea so we're
[11809.72 --> 11817.88]  we're making this oh yeah wow because we're meme learns apparently apparently that's sweet i don't know
[11817.88 --> 11824.76]  dude this isn't the type of thing that i've bought just what if you could have a giant solid aluminum
[11824.76 --> 11829.40]  keycap what would you pay for it i'm just curious i don't think i would buy this what you wouldn't
[11829.40 --> 11833.40]  okay if you saw it in a gift shop for five bucks you wouldn't be like okay that's pretty cool okay i
[11833.40 --> 11840.36]  might buy that okay so it's 350. oh my god i mean if it's going to be from billet aluminum and it's about
[11840.36 --> 11847.48]  that big like it's going to be closer to 350 than 350. yeah that's like 700 us dollars in just billet
[11847.48 --> 11853.48]  stock no no no no it's not that much it's not that much it's it's it's big it's it's big it's
[11853.48 --> 11859.64]  substantial you could there's going to be three sizes how big is the big one the big one is like this
[11860.20 --> 11866.28]  the medium one's like this and the small one's like this okay and the cheapest one um
[11866.28 --> 11870.44]  uh i don't want to i don't want to quote this wrong but they're going to be they're going to be
[11870.44 --> 11877.80]  very expensive uh not not 700 but they're going to be all of them are going to be okay no i just don't
[11877.80 --> 11881.64]  want to say it because i'm going to get it wrong but the the expensive one's going to be pretty expensive
[11881.64 --> 11889.24]  um yeah i don't know this is just one of those things that i i i don't i have no idea what i was
[11889.24 --> 11894.76]  thinking um i don't think you were yeah i don't know but it's awesome i was probably talking to
[11894.76 --> 11900.44]  nicholas plouf or something oh this would be cool yeah yeah big keycap yeah i don't know
[11904.44 --> 11910.84]  uh okay let's move on we're uh we'll have to send one to glarsies oh yeah yeah we'll have to do like
[11910.84 --> 11914.92]  well we'll have to engrave like okay we should probably uh dan can you can you send a note to
[11914.92 --> 11919.00]  nick guys ever should send him a custom working with him i want to at some point but we haven't
[11919.00 --> 11923.40]  yet it just hasn't lined up sorry what yeah because he reached out to me like a long time ago about doing
[11923.40 --> 11932.04]  that yeah i know okay i just i'm busy i know how hard is it for you to get on my calendar yeah fair
[11932.04 --> 11939.48]  enough he's willing to like fly out i know i know i know i know i know i just it's tough okay yep
[11943.08 --> 11948.92]  okay message is sent i have no idea how to spell any of that uh you can figure out what the gibberish
[11948.92 --> 11954.76]  means okay luke and linus what's a decision that you initially regretted but in hindsight turned out
[11954.76 --> 11957.56]  to be a great idea hmm
[11960.44 --> 11969.08]  initially regretted usually i don't get like instant regret because i usually make pretty okay decisions um
[11969.08 --> 11973.72]  um instant regret turned out to be a great idea
[11977.72 --> 11984.60]  gee i don't know it's got there's got to be some kind of see most of the things i regret turn out to
[11984.60 --> 11990.84]  be bad ideas like buying those stupid black magic 12k cameras like that was instant regret and a bad idea
[11990.84 --> 11996.76]  like i uh turned out to be a great idea i saw this one early and have been trying to think about it
[11996.76 --> 12002.36]  like this whole time and i'm in the same spot usually i've thought about it enough that once i
[12002.36 --> 12007.24]  purchase it my opinion on it isn't going to change or i guess it's not just purchases right but like
[12007.24 --> 12012.44]  once i do the thing or whatever my opinion on it isn't really going to change for probably quite a
[12012.44 --> 12016.84]  while trying to think if there's anyone i hired that was like wow what a disappointment but then
[12016.84 --> 12023.40]  they've turned out to be great now you took a lot longer to disappoint me
[12026.92 --> 12030.76]  did i i was sleeping on the job like immediately yeah but i wasn't disappointed that was kind of
[12030.76 --> 12032.60]  my expectation for what you're being paid
[12036.44 --> 12046.20]  fair enough yeah yeah um yeah i don't i don't know yeah just for i have to regret it instantly and then i
[12046.20 --> 12051.08]  it has to turn out to be a great idea if i regret it instantly why don't i get a refund like why don't
[12051.08 --> 12056.28]  i undo it yeah yeah exactly yeah like there's there's i can't think of very many things that fit
[12056.28 --> 12059.88]  this someone said it would be the crowbar hammer for luke and it's like well no because it turned
[12059.88 --> 12064.84]  out to not be a good idea yeah like that doesn't fit like it's more like a cold feet thing like but
[12064.84 --> 12069.72]  i never regretted you know getting engaged right so if i'd regretted that then that would have turned
[12069.72 --> 12073.72]  out to be a great idea or like having kids you know maybe you instantly regretted it but it turned
[12073.72 --> 12077.32]  out to be a great idea like that's the kind of thing we're talking about here but i didn't
[12077.32 --> 12083.32]  instantly regret having kids i i instantly hated it but i knew i was gonna hate it i can't stand
[12083.32 --> 12090.20]  definitely things that i dreaded like i did it and i was like this sucks i don't think this is great i
[12090.20 --> 12096.60]  don't really necessarily have a another option but like i don't like this one and then in hindsight
[12096.60 --> 12102.20]  or down the line or whatever it's like actually that was really good for sure but like there was no
[12102.20 --> 12108.44]  no i instantly regretted allowing the crowd to decorate my car at ltx oh yeah that did not turn
[12108.44 --> 12115.16]  out that was a great idea that was just bad yeah look in my defense that year there was a significant
[12115.16 --> 12122.60]  lack of activities oh there was definitely and i was trying to save it okay i was sacrificing do you
[12122.60 --> 12128.68]  remember our miscommunication during that show no you like it's probably epic though because i was
[12128.68 --> 12135.32]  extremely you were kind of all over the place i was extremely upset when i arrived the night before
[12135.32 --> 12141.56]  it was starting and realized some of the things that were going on and that is not a knock against
[12141.56 --> 12147.72]  the team that was working on it we were understaffed underfunded we had kind of no idea what we were doing
[12147.72 --> 12153.88]  it was only our second attempt at this and it was a much bigger space just it was no one's fault but i was
[12153.88 --> 12162.36]  like holy um we need to fix this what can we do and and i will sacrifice my car one of the things i
[12162.36 --> 12169.72]  thought of was decorate my car booth and so we put out pens and glue and glitter and googly eyes definitely
[12169.72 --> 12175.56]  you know it was memorable kept people busy yeah but that car was actually undrivable people covered the
[12175.56 --> 12183.24]  windshield for crying out loud there was so you were up in like some bleacher section thing and no
[12183.24 --> 12188.92]  one could ever hear you do you remember this yes so if you were in whatever the thing was that you
[12188.92 --> 12193.80]  were talking to people in people could hear you oh like the little yeah there was a little like stage
[12193.80 --> 12199.16]  area it was yeah yeah and it had bleachers around it if you were specifically in like those bleachers or
[12199.16 --> 12203.16]  that area whatever you could hear linus but if you were outside of it it didn't matter if he was like
[12203.16 --> 12207.64]  leaning over the edge and yelling at you you could not hear him at all just how the acoustics of the
[12207.64 --> 12213.80]  area worked yeah i got a really high ceiling so like this and this i think like cancel each other
[12213.80 --> 12222.52]  out effectively the sound bouncing it was pretty wild yeah so someone gave me these like sharpies or
[12222.52 --> 12230.20]  something and they were very unsure about why they were giving them to me but they made it very clear
[12230.20 --> 12236.44]  that there was not very many of these and like i should be very careful with them and i was like
[12236.44 --> 12241.88]  okay this is really weird i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do with these and then you like yelled
[12241.88 --> 12247.08]  something over the thing and i thought you said like keep them away from people or something i don't
[12247.08 --> 12252.12]  remember exactly what i thought you said but i thought you were like this is like a you you can't like
[12252.12 --> 12258.12]  let the random attendees get your sharpie and like if someone gets your sharpie they like get something or
[12258.12 --> 12265.16]  something so i was like oh so i have to like run away with these which is not at all what he said
[12265.16 --> 12271.40]  but i thought it was what he said so i just started running around it was more of like a collect the
[12271.40 --> 12275.80]  pokemon thing people were supposed to try to get signatures and all the colors right something like
[12275.80 --> 12279.40]  that what i thought was going on was they were supposed to collect the sharpies and i remember being
[12279.40 --> 12285.08]  like this is really stupid but okay yeah and it makes sense because that wasn't what was going on
[12285.08 --> 12290.52]  but yeah communication during that event was a huge problem yeah so we can do better we have done
[12290.52 --> 12295.40]  better it's been four years since we did better um hopefully we remember how to do better hopefully
[12295.40 --> 12299.80]  we're not just like yeah i forget how to do this let's start from scratch now they assure me it's going
[12299.80 --> 12305.72]  to be really good i think i've been less involved in the lead up to it though so i don't actually
[12305.72 --> 12311.40]  know that but i do trust the team that's working on it if it was as good as last time would you be happy
[12311.40 --> 12320.20]  honestly yeah if you'd asked me that right after ltx 19 i'd have said no i expect it to be bigger and
[12320.20 --> 12327.40]  better but given the momentum that we lost in four years if it's on par then we'll come back stronger
[12327.40 --> 12335.00]  2024 and we can set our sights on that yeah yeah makes sense okay we're uh nearing the end of the
[12335.00 --> 12340.68]  time here but we've got a lot more to get through companies are currently not liable for abandoning
[12340.68 --> 12346.04]  software support for physical items oh god sorry i just want to i want to interject something i
[12346.04 --> 12351.32]  wasn't the only person that misinterpreted that way while you were talking random fans started trying
[12351.32 --> 12355.24]  to grab the sharpies from my hands and then i remember being mad at you at the end i was like
[12355.24 --> 12360.04]  why did you give away the sharpies we don't have more of those like if we want to continue to have
[12360.04 --> 12365.88]  people collect the thing yeah yeah yeah and i was like and i had i had red marks all up and down my
[12365.88 --> 12370.68]  arms because people were like clawing at me trying to get them and stuff it was it was quite the
[12370.68 --> 12375.64]  racket sorry keep coming oh that's okay here we'll broadcast it companies are currently not liable for
[12375.64 --> 12380.52]  abandoning software support for physical items would you support legislation requiring manufacturers to
[12380.52 --> 12387.48]  state their best supported until date on products no what i really want is for them to have to
[12388.36 --> 12393.00]  hand it over to some other steward if they're not going to support it anymore that just needs to be how
[12393.00 --> 12398.52]  it works i don't think that's ever going to happen so i guess this would be a i guess this would be
[12398.52 --> 12404.44]  something but i just don't want stuff to end up e-waste if it's still working that should be
[12404.44 --> 12410.44]  unacceptable to everyone involved since you've dabbled in making tools like screwdrivers have you
[12410.44 --> 12415.72]  considered making tools for firefighters or paramedics i carry a screwdriver in my bunker gear pockets and
[12415.72 --> 12422.36]  i love it larger tools are common yeah we'd consider making other tools uh we have a hundred thousand
[12423.88 --> 12429.64]  shafts from the original manufacturer for the screwdriver that don't meet our screwdriver shaft
[12429.64 --> 12435.40]  quality standards so they are effectively garbage just metal tubes we have one hundred
[12435.40 --> 12443.64]  thousand of them so we are trying to find some use for them uh without consulting me they asked for
[12443.64 --> 12449.00]  them to be shipped to us so i paid freight over the ocean for a hundred thousand metal shafts it's less
[12449.00 --> 12453.48]  than you would think they weren't air shipped or anything okay it came on a boat yeah um yeah very
[12453.48 --> 12460.92]  slow boat and um we've got some ideas uh what the idea that i pitched first was we make something
[12460.92 --> 12467.80]  called a fail wrench so if you can if you can dodge a hundred thousand dollar loss then you can dodge a
[12467.80 --> 12475.88]  fail wrench so we just melt them and just make like a stupid crappy adjustable wrench and the team was like
[12475.88 --> 12479.36]  no we can't do that it'll be it'll take forever to make it to your standard i'm like no it's a
[12479.36 --> 12483.56]  fail wrench yeah it doesn't have to be to my standard just make it like a bonus bin item
[12483.56 --> 12486.22]  buy a shirt get a wrench
[12486.22 --> 12495.72]  not free shipping shirt weighs 200 grams wrench weighs five pounds one of the ideas we're working
[12495.72 --> 12500.02]  on that's a big wrench uh one of the ideas we're working on now is turning them into a fail pen
[12500.02 --> 12506.62]  so okay like like a bolt action style thing we'd have to get the ergonomics right though and one of
[12506.62 --> 12511.88]  the reasons that they're not deemed acceptable is that the knurling kind of sucks but what sucks
[12511.88 --> 12518.88]  about it is that it's not deep enough so it might actually be okay for a pen um yeah there's there's
[12518.88 --> 12524.48]  some other ideas for things we could melt them down into but like i don't remember what the question
[12524.48 --> 12529.16]  was have we oh yeah we thought of making more tools yeah we're gonna make more tools that's that i i give
[12529.16 --> 12533.08]  you my guarantee but we're probably going to be mostly focused on tech tools just because that's
[12533.08 --> 12537.96]  where the bulk of our audience is yeah linus you mentioned you don't buy games day one but did you
[12537.96 --> 12542.68]  pick up tears of the kingdom and will you be playing it this weekend side note luke needs to play breath of
[12542.68 --> 12550.20]  the wild already i don't think he does you don't think i do i mean unless you really like to
[12550.20 --> 12555.64]  i had fun with it it was just it was a plain game so i know when i'm gonna play it next i know
[12555.64 --> 12561.24]  exactly what i'm gonna play it next because i'm going on a plane soon it's not in my bag but i do
[12561.24 --> 12567.00]  have it i thought so yeah but i'm not gonna play it on my switch yeah my copy that i bought is just
[12567.00 --> 12576.44]  because i know i'm gonna pirate it i i don't want my save data on a switch yeah yeah that's not
[12576.44 --> 12581.14]  unreasonable and i'm not paying for nintendo online forever just to be able to back up my save game
[12581.14 --> 12589.06]  that's ridiculous i don't accept it i'm sorry i consider this to be ethical piracy so yeah i've
[12589.06 --> 12594.98]  already downloaded it but i haven't actually like applied all the patches and 60 fps mod and blah
[12594.98 --> 12601.06]  blah blah blah blah blah blah so i'm gonna i'm gonna play it on the uh rg ally yeah breath of the wild
[12601.06 --> 12607.06]  runs really good on the ally that's pretty sweet and i'm expecting because it's designed for the same
[12607.06 --> 12610.82]  hardware and breath of the wild was already at the limits of what it could do that tears of the
[12610.82 --> 12614.02]  kingdom probably isn't going to be much more demanding than breath of the wild and what's
[12614.02 --> 12618.26]  great about all of this is i can take that same save game and i can play it on my projector
[12618.90 --> 12623.30]  off of my pc or i can play it on the ally or i can play it wherever and i can keep my save game
[12624.50 --> 12628.42]  it's gonna be awesome i won't get to keep my horses though but i don't really care because it's
[12628.42 --> 12632.66]  been like three years since i've touched breath of the wild three or four so i don't even remember
[12632.66 --> 12636.02]  my horse's name or what it looks like so makes no difference to me
[12636.02 --> 12645.94]  shout out to the newlyweds i and rc his best man name dropped ltdstore.com during his speech
[12647.38 --> 12653.38]  and i just had to share the moment happy friday heck yeah thanks for letting us know nice i don't
[12653.38 --> 12659.86]  think i have seen weekly float plane exclusives on lmg clips in a while what happened to it is that over
[12659.86 --> 12664.98]  did not attract people to float plane oh it's not over but it was never intended to be weekly
[12664.98 --> 12669.70]  it was going to be sometimes we'll you know we'll try it and see how it works as a promotional
[12669.70 --> 12670.98]  mechanism and it works great
[12673.38 --> 12679.06]  okay and we are now done with our curated so let's go through some of these potentials rapid
[12679.06 --> 12684.90]  fire if you can would ltd be willing to go home or something no well i want you to be protected from
[12684.90 --> 12689.62]  the ire of ivan what do you want to go home is that is that we've had this discussion linus
[12690.18 --> 12691.70]  i will stay here till monday
[12694.02 --> 12699.62]  only monday what are you weak no i have stuff to do for luke on monday that's true that's to go to
[12699.62 --> 12705.22]  the other building but luke will be here yep other building no but wancho is here so you'll be here
[12705.22 --> 12710.10]  ah that's true i mean if we're still doing wancho then it's fine yeah i got enough monitors for the
[12710.10 --> 12722.90]  both of us what was the question i don't know uh would ltd be willing to release the stl file for
[12722.90 --> 12727.38]  stick locks to the community so we can print our own out of tpu support those gamers who cannot
[12727.38 --> 12737.54]  afford to pay for them um probably not unfortunately for this one uh i'm afraid that the individual
[12737.54 --> 12745.14]  people printing them are not the concern uh they could easily enough you know probably
[12745.14 --> 12750.66]  reverse engineer it and kind of figure it out but if we give the exact files to an overseas
[12750.66 --> 12754.74]  manufacturer inevitably they're going to be cloned anyway i get that but i'm not going to go out of
[12754.74 --> 12764.18]  my way to make it easier i guess is what i'm trying to say hi um dll actually nicolaitis told me i
[12764.18 --> 12771.38]  should be pronouncing this dale hi dale uh questions for linus about the sony a95k tv have you run in a
[12771.38 --> 12778.10]  blue tint problem due to fingerprints and has been and you're unable to clean them sorry let me parse
[12778.10 --> 12783.38]  this again have you run into the issue with blue tint due to fingerprints and not being able to clean
[12783.38 --> 12789.78]  them tons of people have had this issue and zero acknowledgement from sony huh um i can't say i have
[12789.78 --> 12794.66]  because i'm not a caveman i don't touch my tv screen uh i understand that a lot of people have
[12794.66 --> 12800.18]  kids so it might not actually be avoidable i'm i was being facetious um but no i haven't run into it
[12800.18 --> 12805.30]  because there are no fingerprints on my tv so it's possible that it is an issue but it's not one that i've
[12805.30 --> 12813.30]  encountered really excited for the stick locks thanks for making them linus you've talked about your love
[12813.30 --> 12820.74]  for final fantasy tactics in the past what's your favorite class and team style oh man i'm not even
[12820.74 --> 12831.94]  aware of like team styles i just i like um i like kind of i like kind of tanky uh tanky casters oh okay
[12831.94 --> 12840.02]  if i had if i had a team style uh i guess i'm a big move plus two like i will i will waste so much time
[12840.02 --> 12846.10]  uh with my guys uh oh man what's the what's the class i haven't played it in a while um
[12847.38 --> 12856.42]  move plus two tactics let's see what what the heck is blink blade okay i have no idea what's even going
[12856.42 --> 12865.22]  on uh final fantasy tactics here we go move step man why is this so hard to find okay i'm sure someone's
[12865.22 --> 12870.02]  i'm sure someone's telling me in the thing but i will basically take every one of my party members
[12870.50 --> 12873.30]  and make sure they have move plus two i
[12876.58 --> 12882.26]  come on guys help me out here nope nothing yet yeah i don't know i have no idea
[12884.98 --> 12890.74]  i'm just trying to think like what are i use a lot of the special characters i always love agrius agrius
[12890.74 --> 12901.94]  whatever her name is um i hate anything that's kind of like probability based so you know uh i know
[12901.94 --> 12908.02]  you can build like just super op like ninjas and stuff like that because they have like crazy high
[12908.02 --> 12914.58]  evade but i would rather have super high defense and have like a predictable amount of damage than
[12914.58 --> 12924.10]  super high evade and sometimes i dodge and sometimes i get absolutely bone crushed i i don't i don't like
[12924.10 --> 12931.22]  too much randomness apparently move plus two is thief yeah thief sucks so much in final fantasy tactics
[12931.22 --> 12937.54]  uh but i will make everyone grind like a thousand job points in thief to get move plus two because when
[12937.54 --> 12945.22]  you're mobile like that you are unstoppable um because otherwise you get screwed like i think the
[12945.22 --> 12952.66]  default move stat is like two or three rather and then some classes are more and then you can add move
[12952.66 --> 12956.74]  plus two so you can move like six oh no there's items that's right there's items you can equip for
[12956.74 --> 12961.70]  like move plus one so you can put on boots and then add move plus two and then you can go six so you can
[12961.70 --> 12968.18]  basically go in hit retreat and human characters that are that are fighting with you will not be
[12968.18 --> 12972.42]  able to catch up easily but monsters are super mobile and it can be a real problem because you
[12972.42 --> 12982.02]  can't get away from them they just close the distance so fast anyway hey dale oh no they're moving uh
[12982.02 --> 12989.14]  well i'll try this one hey there i've taken a liking to boxers with man pouches they feel comfy
[12989.14 --> 12996.42]  for my important parts during hot days at home do you think ltt will one day offer boxers with mound man
[12996.42 --> 13001.94]  pouches um well congratulations
[13009.54 --> 13015.70]  i i honestly was reading that whole time all i got from what you said was man pouches and then he just
[13015.70 --> 13021.62]  said congratulations so whatever happened was funny i almost said mouches at the last one fumbled
[13021.62 --> 13027.86]  at um i don't know we get a lot of we get a lot of really great feedback on the comfort of the boxers
[13027.86 --> 13034.82]  boxer briefs as they are i think we're more likely to do more styles and less likely to do um new um
[13034.82 --> 13043.62]  new bodies for them ergonomics yeah for the time being i have a 3d um let's see uh yeah this is kind of in the same
[13043.62 --> 13048.66]  3d printer realm i have a 3d printer and would love to make use of it with all the products you're
[13048.66 --> 13053.30]  rolling out would you consider a line of 3d downloadable models relating to electronics or
[13053.30 --> 13059.62]  cable management no i don't think so um it's just one of those things where i think there's stuff that
[13059.62 --> 13064.10]  we've released in the past or something i think our cpu holders are out there but we're not going to
[13064.10 --> 13069.14]  charge for that like if it's something that you can 3d print then why don't you just 3d print it
[13069.14 --> 13073.62]  um and there's a huge community out there that's designing 3d printable stuff like go go do your
[13073.62 --> 13078.18]  thing uh the reason that you know you should buy stick locks instead of just 3d printing them is
[13078.18 --> 13085.14]  because 3d printing is not the be-all and end-all of manufacturing and uh in this case these are i
[13085.14 --> 13090.98]  forget if they're uh pressure pressure mold or there's there's two different ways that you can do
[13090.98 --> 13096.66]  injection molding for a part like this and we did one of them i can't remember which and the reason was
[13096.66 --> 13103.30]  that it gets the composition just right um allows you to customize the material like there's a whole
[13103.30 --> 13108.10]  there's a whole bunch of there's a whole science you know to materials it's called material science
[13108.10 --> 13113.86]  oh wow yeah i know right um so for us you know the products that we make and sell are going to be ones
[13113.86 --> 13121.94]  that do require um more complex manufacturing at least you know at scale right and if you guys want to
[13121.94 --> 13126.26]  like make your own thing and 3d print them then yeah you should that's awesome it's freaking amazing
[13127.14 --> 13133.86]  but it's a different thing and i i don't think we would like sell that hi dale i love my new ltd
[13133.86 --> 13139.14]  backpack compliments to sarah and everyone in the creator warehouse great job will the ltd backpack
[13139.14 --> 13149.70]  hold the upcoming framework 16 um yeah yeah it should be fine i'd have to double check for sure
[13149.70 --> 13154.58]  but it should be fine uh compression molded says tainen who is apparently watching one show right now yes
[13154.58 --> 13161.78]  these are compression molded not injection molded thank you tainen hi dll i notice in linus media
[13161.78 --> 13167.22]  group.com the team doesn't show luke there is that because he is float plane or has his change in
[13167.22 --> 13172.34]  role mean he is still separate from the main company also i'm not reading the rest of the night yeah
[13172.34 --> 13180.02]  continue uh just laziness i think yeah originally that was the reason but then creator warehouse became a
[13180.02 --> 13186.42]  a thing and people that work under creator warehouse are on there um so like a bunch of years after that
[13186.42 --> 13193.70]  happened someone pointed that out because i've never really cared to be honest um and we were like
[13193.70 --> 13200.58]  oh well we'll fix that eventually and we will fix that eventually people keep on offering to take
[13200.58 --> 13206.02]  headshots of just me but my current thing is like well if i'm going on all my people should probably
[13206.02 --> 13211.94]  go on so what will probably happen is um at one of the events like either christmas party or ltx or
[13211.94 --> 13216.18]  something when all of the remotes kind of come in and we'll probably do a bunch of headshots and then
[13216.18 --> 13220.10]  do them all at the same time so that we all go up together or something like that i don't know
[13220.10 --> 13228.42]  but yeah hey dll love the content have been following since about 2011. out of curiosity
[13228.42 --> 13235.78]  how many of the float plane users still have the uh og three dollar tier i i could figure this out i
[13235.78 --> 13240.50]  don't know the number off the top of my head but it's like quite a few a lot of people that
[13240.50 --> 13247.78]  subscribed back then are just still here it's pretty cool it's sick yeah and i think the last one we have
[13247.78 --> 13254.34]  for tonight hello future me what interesting things have you experienced when supplying or acquiring
[13254.34 --> 13260.34]  different products restock of pajama pants when i don't know about the restock but um i mean here
[13260.34 --> 13268.18]  was an interesting thing our t-shirts for ltx our initial sample that i approved and the top of
[13268.18 --> 13274.26]  production sample that we got very different materials oh yeah so we think a supplier might have
[13274.26 --> 13281.22]  switched subcontractors on us oh so we are deeply worried about ltx t-shirts they're either going to
[13282.26 --> 13288.10]  be less comfortable than we expected to be clear they're not awful but they're not up to our usual
[13288.10 --> 13292.66]  shirt standard and part of that is because we couldn't just use our regular blanks because they're
[13292.66 --> 13299.38]  tie-dye and yeah you can't have synthetic materials it's got to be cotton got it uh so they're either going to
[13299.38 --> 13304.58]  be less comfortable than our usual standard or they will not exist at this point because i don't know
[13304.58 --> 13309.86]  if you noticed but we're getting pretty close yeah it's not that far away yeah so i'm um very unhappy
[13309.86 --> 13320.18]  there that's the most recent me very unhappy big surprise merch moment i think that's it hey we'll see
[13320.18 --> 13334.18]  you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[13334.18 --> 13340.18]  so
[13350.18 --> 13372.18]  out
