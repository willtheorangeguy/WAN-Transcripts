I know why you're here... Don't worry, I got chu.

When I heard hard R I was actually thinking of a word that rhymes with grape, perhaps the meanings have changed a bit over the years and across different regions.
Linus mentioned Final Fantasy Tactics a whole bunch but not which version.  There were at least 2 games of that name which were completely different one for the PS1 and one for the GBA, I'm guessing the Android version Luke mentioned is a update/port to one of those.  Is time stamp guy late or has YouTube altered the algorithm in a way to makes him not appear, usually there's at least one time stamp comment by now (I was going to look at timestamps to see if there was anything else to add to my own comment)?
