[0.00 --> 4.74]  Welcome to the WAN show. We've got a great show lined up for you guys this week
[5.74 --> 10.16]  Let's see. No, no, there was a thing. There was a thing I wanted to talk about. It was in there
[10.96 --> 13.36]  I mean sure
[14.80 --> 18.52]  We've talked before about GM's infotainment centers
[19.04 --> 23.12]  Abandoning Android Auto and CarPlay and now it is all
[23.50 --> 28.00]  Ready biting them in the butt who could have possibly seen it coming. Oh, I don't know
[28.00 --> 36.06]  Maybe us and our headline topic Google has settled over incognito mode agreeing to pay yes my friends
[36.94 --> 42.90]  billions of dollars because guess what it was never as incognito as you thought it was and
[44.04 --> 46.52]  It's never gonna be awesome. Yeah
[47.10 --> 53.76]  China targets video game spending and some of their largest companies get hit real hard and also
[53.76 --> 56.26]  I had another one where to go. Oh
[57.32 --> 62.52]  There's not a lot this week. Yeah, you can go with the LTT screwdriver being in this game sure
[62.52 --> 68.72]  Yeah, the LTT screwdriver is stellar conquest apparently that's cool. Yeah, yeah
[83.76 --> 92.52]  The show is brought to you today by maximum settings forum and
[93.26 --> 94.26]  dbrand
[94.26 --> 102.20]  Why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day and that is of course Google's settlement over incognito mode
[102.20 --> 107.74]  Google has agreed to settle a 2020 lawsuit alleging that the company continued to
[108.26 --> 109.26]  track
[109.26 --> 113.14]  Collect and identify users browsing data in real time
[113.86 --> 122.02]  While they had chrome's incognito mode enabled this was obviously a big splash back when it first came out a few years ago
[122.70 --> 125.74]  Google has tried since then to have the suit dismissed
[125.74 --> 131.36]  citing a warning that they displayed whenever incognito mode was enabled that informed users that
[132.14 --> 136.76]  Websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during this session
[137.66 --> 141.36]  However, I mean I don't have to be an expert to tell you that
[142.04 --> 144.80]  Google never said that they weren't gonna collect it
[145.32 --> 150.80]  Yeah, or sorry Google never said they were still going to collect it. That's the thing
[150.80 --> 153.92]  They did say they weren't gonna collect it. That's the whole problem. They are a website
[153.92 --> 160.04]  The judge rejected Google's request on the grounds that the warning did not adequately inform users that
[160.56 --> 168.38]  Google's data collection would continue even while in incognito mode because I gotta be honest with you on the surface of it
[168.38 --> 176.96]  I would assume based on the name of incognito mode the stated purpose of incognito mode and the messaging around incognito mode
[177.36 --> 183.16]  That it actually stops Google from tracking exactly what it is that I'm doing and logging it anywhere
[183.16 --> 185.64]  It feels like I've always known you're essentially just
[186.42 --> 188.42]  turning history off temporarily
[189.34 --> 192.54]  But I think most people don't assume it just works that way so
[193.04 --> 195.42]  Yeah, I don't know it Google's taking some big L's man
[195.54 --> 200.44]  Wait, did I say billions because I read that somewhere but that appears to be
[200.74 --> 203.92]  We don't know what the settlement is not even at least not at this time
[204.06 --> 208.00]  No, no, no exact terms of the settlement are unknown at this time. So scratch that
[208.00 --> 213.50]  I may be conflating two completely different things, but there is some kind of settlement and we are
[213.96 --> 221.38]  Hopefully gonna figure that out at some point the discussion question for us here is is it reasonable to expect that a person using
[221.38 --> 225.38]  Incognito mode would understand that Google still tracking them? No, no, I don't think so
[225.38 --> 229.80]  I mean here look we can we can play this game in real time
[229.80 --> 234.32]  I can launch incognito mode which as far as I can tell
[234.32 --> 241.68]  Well hasn't changed at any point in this process and as far as I can tell isn't going to change at
[242.10 --> 244.72]  all and we can see right here
[245.72 --> 252.82]  Exactly the way that Google continues to message this even after the settlement now you can browse
[253.32 --> 255.32]  privately and
[255.32 --> 260.24]  Here we go other people who use this device won't see your activity now
[260.24 --> 267.16]  They do say so they kind of imply that what this is doing is to Luke's point earlier just effectively
[267.42 --> 271.12]  Turning off that local history on your computer
[271.68 --> 272.90]  however
[272.90 --> 277.24]  Downloads bookmarks and reading list items will be saved learn more
[277.80 --> 281.24]  Chrome won't save the following
[281.60 --> 287.50]  Chrome won't save the following yeah your browsing history cookies and site data
[287.50 --> 290.16]  Information entered in forms
[290.84 --> 292.44]  Chrome won't save
[293.06 --> 302.00]  Your activity might still be visible to the websites you visit your employer or school your internet service provider and this is true
[302.38 --> 304.70]  Unless you are here in these cases
[305.82 --> 311.46]  Using a VPN or some other kind of tunneling or in data encrypting service
[311.46 --> 317.90]  Um, and so I guess what we see here is that from Google's point of view
[318.70 --> 322.16]  It's maybe not a lie. Nothing here is a lie
[324.28 --> 325.34]  Yeah, oh
[325.34 --> 331.34]  I'm trying to find no, I don't have anything. I'm trying to find like screenshots of the really old version
[331.34 --> 335.30]  Um, but it certainly is a miss
[335.86 --> 337.78]  Lead by omission
[337.78 --> 341.06]  You know lie is a high bar to clear
[341.58 --> 343.58]  I feel
[343.58 --> 350.68]  Damn, I'm gonna have an eye statement here. I feel that Google's intent was to mislead
[350.68 --> 358.30]  I feel Google probably knew what they were doing and knew better and I feel that this is
[358.30 --> 361.48]  Pretty easily categorized as a lie
[362.00 --> 367.54]  but the you have to prove that and I I I I I don't uh
[368.18 --> 372.78]  I don't think that's something that I can improve that I can prove and yeah, this is uh
[372.78 --> 376.68]  This is a perfect example of a lie by omissions as loud face Bob in the float plane chat
[376.68 --> 379.42]  Yeah, exactly if we could prove that it was a lie
[379.42 --> 382.70]  I think it would be a lie by by omission because they
[383.26 --> 387.74]  seemingly I feel lead us to believe that incognito mode
[387.74 --> 393.96]  Prevents google from tracking what you're doing, but all they said was chrome
[393.96 --> 399.06]  Oh, you meant all of our other products and services
[399.06 --> 401.26]  Ha ha ha
[401.26 --> 408.86]  I'm sorry and I mean anyone who's really made their way down the internet privacy rabbit hole is gonna know
[408.86 --> 415.08]  That even if incognito mode worked the way that people might have assumed that it works based on that messaging
[415.08 --> 428.08]  There are so many ways that you and your device can be fingerprinted by the services and the websites that you visit everything from the if you have an unusual
[428.08 --> 430.08]  resolution
[430.08 --> 432.08]  uh on your phone
[432.72 --> 437.30]  Okay, and then you log into the same email account on a computer
[438.16 --> 441.68]  somewhere like there there's so many different ways that
[442.64 --> 449.30]  Your devices can be tied to you and to each other. Um, so for example, what is it?
[449.30 --> 452.30]  um and they don't actually need
[452.30 --> 454.30]  100% data perfection
[454.30 --> 460.06]  No, as long as they're pretty sure they can still paint a picture that's extremely accurate
[460.78 --> 464.14]  Because it's it's very likely that if someone shares
[464.86 --> 468.30]  95% of the commonality traits between
[469.18 --> 474.54]  You and them that that fudged data where you got something attached from them to you or whatever else
[474.78 --> 479.82]  It's probably accurate or close to it anyways. So like yeah, so here's the question
[482.30 --> 484.70]  Is it time to switch to firefox?
[486.54 --> 491.90]  I wish man if you ask firefox people the time to switch to firefox was years ago. Yeah
[493.18 --> 498.06]  But for real though for people like you daily drive chrome still I believe right yeah
[498.54 --> 500.54]  I try firefox once a year
[501.58 --> 507.50]  Wow, okay flow plane chat has some thoughts yeah on the whole switch to firefox. Okay, we need a poll
[507.50 --> 511.82]  We need a poll. Is it time to switch and and firefox isn't the only option?
[511.82 --> 517.98]  Uh, I already mentioned brave. I know there's some other chromium. Well, it's just chromium, but with some
[519.50 --> 521.50]  With some spice. Um, yeah
[524.22 --> 526.70]  Okay, is it time to switch to firefox yes
[528.78 --> 529.50]  Yes, no
[531.74 --> 533.74]  It's pretty cool. It's open source
[534.94 --> 539.02]  Yeah, no brave brave seems to be legitimately not not stupid
[539.02 --> 545.74]  Um, people are talking about vivaldi vivaldi really hasn't seen the same kind of penetration that
[546.06 --> 549.66]  Firefox being the only one that's not chromium still basically
[550.30 --> 555.26]  Um, so i'm gonna i'm gonna among the chromium's brave potentially throw some water on this fire
[555.98 --> 560.94]  Um, and the 70 ish percent of people that are saying it is time to switch to firefox
[560.94 --> 564.30]  Let's do a poll after this and see what browser people use
[565.74 --> 568.62]  Uh, because well, we don't have to do a poll on 70 percent
[568.62 --> 571.18]  We could just check not using firefox. Ah, yes, okay
[574.38 --> 577.34]  Okay, he he he he he he got to the punchline yeah
[577.90 --> 581.18]  Um, what is the percentage do you know haven't checked in a while?
[581.18 --> 583.10]  I guarantee you it's not 70 percent using firefox
[583.58 --> 585.58]  Hmm
[585.58 --> 591.02]  Where could where else could we where uh check me right now? Oh boy. Oh boy. Okay. Can you not
[591.66 --> 597.42]  Form an overtly adversarial relationship with no playing? You know what use firefox here here's okay?
[597.42 --> 599.26]  I didn't have enough time to get into it
[599.26 --> 601.42]  It doesn't feel like it's time to switch to firefox yet
[601.98 --> 607.18]  My reason for that is because a lot of sites are not built to work on firefox properly
[607.18 --> 612.86]  Firefox has some of its own issues. Yeah, sure. So does chrome. So does edge. So does everything else
[613.26 --> 620.38]  My problem is uh, the last time I tried to switch to firefox was when I was uh studying for patty scuba diving stuff
[620.38 --> 624.22]  That was a long time ago though. That was just slightly over a year ago
[624.94 --> 630.22]  What yeah, wait, you had your scuba cert before I was getting advanced certifications. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay
[630.22 --> 632.78]  Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. The initial one was a long
[632.78 --> 633.90]  No, yeah, yeah, um
[634.62 --> 637.18]  The patty website just like doesn't work in firefox at all
[637.98 --> 641.74]  Yeah, and I like looked it up and it's a thing and it's just super not built for it, etc
[641.74 --> 645.82]  So it's it's not really like it they did a bad job of making their website
[646.46 --> 648.46]  um
[648.86 --> 650.46]  That's kind of the issue so
[651.90 --> 653.66]  I want more people to use firefox
[654.38 --> 659.58]  Even though it doesn't really feel like it's necessarily time yet for people to actually switch because if more people move to firefox
[659.58 --> 666.14]  Then sites are gonna have to be forced to build for better compatibility for firefox because right now they're like
[666.78 --> 669.02]  easy way to build it's just build for chrome
[669.98 --> 672.30]  And then whatever you're gonna hit almost everybody anyways
[672.78 --> 676.62]  Yeah, I mean even edge is just chromium now. So so like
[677.66 --> 678.70]  Yeah, um
[680.22 --> 681.34]  Yeah
[681.34 --> 683.50]  aj aj could give me the percentages if he's around
[683.50 --> 684.78]  Uh
[684.78 --> 688.06]  I don't know if he's around and I don't want to like bug him if he's not around
[688.06 --> 693.02]  Yeah, sorry. I'm trying to i'm trying to log into the forum because I think I can check I think I can check the forum one
[694.06 --> 698.06]  But my stupid chrome doesn't have my extensions
[699.02 --> 699.34]  thing
[700.22 --> 705.18]  Showing right now because it needs to relaunch for an update or something at least I think that's the problem
[705.18 --> 706.94]  Oh, you know what it might just be that i'm on the wrong
[706.94 --> 709.10]  It might just be that this is the one with the wrong profile
[709.10 --> 712.86]  Uh, we're not gonna bug aj, but I guarantee you it's not 70 of users
[714.06 --> 717.02]  No, shot. What is this? Oh, okay
[718.62 --> 723.82]  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah throw up a browser pull um, so when's the when's the last time you tried it then?
[724.54 --> 731.58]  Firefox. Yeah, that was it so i'm due to try it again soon. Okay, okay. Well, maybe it is time then and maybe you just don't know
[731.58 --> 735.02]  I'll try it. I'll run it tonight. I'm not even i'm not even
[735.66 --> 741.74]  Playing it's around time. I genuinely do it like once a year generally so i'm down all right
[741.74 --> 744.78]  I want it to work really badly. My problem is
[747.34 --> 750.86]  That I do so much of my work in a browser
[752.78 --> 757.18]  And a lot of google services if it ends up being less efficient
[758.30 --> 763.34]  I can't let my like personal I would rather use firefox because of various reasons
[764.30 --> 768.78]  Slow down my work if that makes sense. Yeah, that doesn't line up for me. That makes sense
[768.78 --> 772.94]  I mean honestly, that's a big part of the reason that I stopped doing so many challenges
[773.34 --> 776.62]  Yeah, like I did the switch to windows phone way back in the day
[776.62 --> 781.98]  Yeah, I did the switch to mac os way back in the day and like like daily drove these things for
[782.62 --> 783.90]  a very
[783.90 --> 785.58]  real period of time
[785.58 --> 791.74]  Yeah, and I just it got to the point where it was like oh, I could do another switched thing
[791.74 --> 793.02]  But I could just
[793.58 --> 797.98]  Or I could just make videos about something else and that would be way more efficient
[798.54 --> 801.42]  My thing is like how would I if I had to sit down in a meeting with you
[801.98 --> 805.10]  And you're like, huh, this took like a long time. Why did this take so long?
[805.10 --> 807.66]  And it's like oh because I wanted to use firefox
[808.22 --> 810.22]  Like how do I explain it?
[810.22 --> 817.82]  That's that's like it. That's like you work at the graveyard. Okay, and like wow, it took you a long time
[817.82 --> 822.94]  To dig that hole. Uh, why did you why did you use a pickaxe instead of a shovel?
[823.34 --> 828.78]  Big shovel is just and you're just like yeah, I evil. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't want to support
[830.86 --> 832.86]  Big shovel
[832.86 --> 839.18]  And you know what it sucks that sucks that that's the world we live in
[840.14 --> 842.46]  There's no way dude people are lying
[842.78 --> 850.06]  I guarantee people are lying people are lying really we talked earlier on this very show about how lie is an extremely high bar to clear
[850.78 --> 852.78]  You're saying they're lying
[855.18 --> 859.58]  I mean unless unless very specifically wow the poll just broke
[859.58 --> 861.58]  Um, um
[861.58 --> 867.26]  Unless very specifically the uh, the the live way and show audience
[868.14 --> 873.50]  Is specifically skewed towards firefox which might be a thing maybe
[875.26 --> 880.70]  Okay, so we're looking at 45 saying they're using firefox
[882.54 --> 886.22]  I don't know guys there was that big thing recently with
[887.18 --> 889.50]  uh, you know chrome trying to
[889.50 --> 895.58]  Block ad blockers and all that kind of stuff and people are firefox maybe that increases the percentage maybe the live audience is
[896.06 --> 897.18]  particularly
[897.18 --> 897.82]  uh
[897.82 --> 904.46]  Skewed towards firefox i'm surprised fewer aren't on brave brave must be one of those super loud minority ones
[904.62 --> 907.26]  I forgot brave i'm just doing another one with it. Oh, no, no
[907.26 --> 911.18]  I mean other well, whatever they can vote for other only seven percent of people are in others
[911.18 --> 915.82]  So clearly it's not going to be a podium finisher anyway close that first poll. I didn't know yeah, no
[915.82 --> 918.70]  I think it just broke. I just got to throw up another one everybody can fake this one
[918.70 --> 920.94]  I think people were a little enthusiastic about that probably
[924.38 --> 925.26]  Okay, sorry
[925.26 --> 929.34]  I'm I I have spent this entire time trying to get logged into the forum because
[929.90 --> 932.06]  I love password managers and
[932.94 --> 934.94]  I love um
[935.82 --> 943.18]  And I and I love 2fa so very much you really shouldn't be logging into a password manager on that laptop. I I never would
[943.18 --> 944.30]  Oh good
[945.50 --> 950.86]  I would never log into a password manager on this laptop. That would be irresponsible
[952.38 --> 954.62]  Opera gx is an interesting one because they spend
[955.26 --> 957.82]  a monstrous amount of money on advertising and then
[958.38 --> 961.98]  Yeah, isn't their whole thing that it's like the the gaming browser? We did it
[961.98 --> 967.34]  We did a whole video about it a while back and as far as we could tell there were a couple cool features, but
[967.98 --> 970.78]  Not a ton that made it particularly
[971.98 --> 973.66]  Gaming per se yeah
[975.74 --> 976.54]  The fact that there's
[977.66 --> 981.82]  Theoretically twice as many people on brave than there is on opera gx is interesting
[981.82 --> 987.34]  All right, here we go. I am hacking the mainframe
[988.14 --> 992.54]  I believe from the forum admin dashboard. I can see
[993.42 --> 998.14]  The browser stats, but I don't actually know this so hey good luck
[999.34 --> 1001.66]  Forums assist online users by app
[1002.30 --> 1004.30]  Does anyone does anyone use?
[1004.30 --> 1008.46]  Envision power and know how to know how to check this?
[1009.82 --> 1012.38]  It's been a long time. Yeah, I know right?
[1014.14 --> 1019.26]  Uh, is there like uh, is there like here here's that's in there somewhere here's it. Yeah, exactly
[1019.74 --> 1021.02]  I'm sure it is, but I
[1021.58 --> 1023.50]  I'm sure I don't remember how to check
[1024.22 --> 1030.14]  Oh, oh we can check sales though. We can see how many people have bought the Christmas album. It's not that many this year
[1030.38 --> 1034.22]  It's actually pretty low. Uh, yeah, there seems to be not a lot of action going
[1034.30 --> 1039.50]  On I think we have a total of three sales this december. Yeah, uh, oh since june
[1039.74 --> 1043.74]  We have three sales since june. That's the right. That's the right number of people
[1045.82 --> 1049.10]  Uh activity users. Oh, oh users maybe
[1050.30 --> 1055.18]  Rank progression. I don't even know what it what any device usage. How about device usage? Maybe it's in there
[1057.26 --> 1059.26]  Man, I don't remember
[1059.58 --> 1061.74]  The last time that I logged into this
[1062.70 --> 1069.02]  Firefox literally gets paid by google to me that makes no difference between them rather use edge and it's great features
[1070.22 --> 1075.58]  Really? Well, that's a spicy take that is a unique take okay, um
[1076.86 --> 1083.50]  We are predominantly a desktop community. I can tell you that much right now. It's not a very good experience on mobile
[1083.50 --> 1088.46]  So that's probably I use it on mobile all the time. What do you mean? It's not a good experience. It's fine
[1090.86 --> 1093.42]  Oh, I think what you want tap-a-talk
[1093.42 --> 1100.14]  You're gonna start that debate again. I'm surprised you even remember you want to start that again
[1100.70 --> 1105.02]  Because I'll go let's go. I'm ready to go. No, I'm happy. We didn't do it
[1107.26 --> 1111.26]  No, I think I know the forums the forum the forum's great forums great on mobile
[1111.26 --> 1115.90]  I use it literally i i'm willing to bet if I open up my browser right now
[1116.62 --> 1122.54]  Oh, yeah, I see it. There it is. Boom right there. It's awesome. Other than that. I always have this stupid updates available
[1123.58 --> 1128.86]  Um, yeah, no, no man. No, man. It's great. It runs great. It's not too bad online users
[1128.86 --> 1133.10]  Maybe now that's probably that's kind of probably just gonna be people who are who are online
[1133.82 --> 1134.78]  Right now
[1134.78 --> 1138.86]  Does anyone know I haven't actually been looking at the chat to see if anyone?
[1139.74 --> 1141.18]  anyone knows
[1141.18 --> 1142.54]  You know what?
[1142.54 --> 1145.42]  Yeah, I got device usage, but I don't have
[1146.62 --> 1152.06]  I don't see anywhere to check what browser people are using so I'm afraid I'm afraid we're in the dark here
[1152.22 --> 1154.22]  Maybe we can ask aj next week
[1154.94 --> 1160.62]  Yeah, tell to let us know what's going on over on the forum. Why don't we jump into our next topic here then?
[1160.62 --> 1162.62]  Boop
[1164.22 --> 1165.34]  Oh, nice dan
[1165.82 --> 1168.14]  Getting caught up with the with the little sign there
[1168.86 --> 1170.38]  I'm gonna let luke pick this time
[1171.02 --> 1176.46]  Okay, you want to talk about china targeting video game spending or yeah, I actually think this is kind of interesting
[1177.02 --> 1180.14]  I thought it was really interesting. Yeah, give me one quick second. Sorry
[1182.22 --> 1183.02]  That's fine. We'll wait
[1183.90 --> 1187.26]  Let's see how many let's see hold on i'm just gonna while while he's doing whatever it is
[1187.26 --> 1191.98]  He's doing i'm gonna add up read the topic. No, I'm gonna add up how many people are waiting for luke to check his phone
[1191.98 --> 1197.34]  As part of its long-standing fight against video game addiction chinese officials have proposed a new set of regulations
[1197.66 --> 1202.70]  That would ban online games from giving gay giving players rewards for logging in every day
[1203.26 --> 1209.90]  Spending money in game for the first time or spending money repeatedly games would also be banned from offering miners
[1210.62 --> 1212.46]  probability based
[1212.46 --> 1219.82]  Luck draws or enabling speculation on virtual game items. Can I just say um, I don't agree with everything china does
[1220.70 --> 1222.70]  but this is based
[1223.18 --> 1225.02]  I think that's the word for it. Yeah
[1225.66 --> 1230.62]  Like that. I think this is great so far and we're not even we're not even through the whole thing yet
[1230.62 --> 1238.56]  Further publishers would be required to store servers within the country and to cap how much money players can add to their digital wallets
[1239.02 --> 1242.88]  This can this is what what is what is like more based?
[1244.02 --> 1246.02]  like wub
[1246.02 --> 1248.02]  based wax it's
[1252.02 --> 1254.02]  Oh
[1254.02 --> 1260.98]  Oh man, um as a show of good faith
[1261.78 --> 1269.46]  I also like this part. I don't know as a show of good faith chinese officials have also proposed a rule requiring regulators to process
[1269.70 --> 1277.38]  Applications for games to be approved in the country within 60 days and approved 40 new games for import on the same day
[1277.62 --> 1279.62]  the reason why I care about this is
[1279.62 --> 1281.62]  is
[1281.62 --> 1287.30]  Boy, I think you've ran into it significantly more than I have because I've never ran into it and I know you have but you know um
[1288.26 --> 1295.54]  Government stuff can literally take years sometimes. Oh, yeah. Do you know? Oh my gosh. Hold on
[1295.86 --> 1301.70]  I need to find out if we can talk about this the construction industry is insane for this you'll buy a plot of land
[1302.50 --> 1303.62]  Get a yeah
[1303.62 --> 1309.06]  I mean it's zoned for this level approval, but you can't dig and then you I've heard
[1309.62 --> 1315.46]  Contractors needing to own that land for years before they can build on it. Uh, hold on a second. Hey hey vawn
[1316.26 --> 1322.10]  Yeah, would it be problematic in any way if we talked about live on when you're on when show?
[1322.82 --> 1323.38]  um
[1323.38 --> 1328.26]  Would it be problematic in any way if we talked about the lead time on certain?
[1328.98 --> 1331.38]  Tax credits and like how long that's taken
[1332.10 --> 1334.10]  Oh, yeah
[1335.54 --> 1337.54]  Probably
[1337.54 --> 1340.10]  Yeah, okay, we'll be leaving that one alone. Thanks dear
[1341.38 --> 1342.42]  You're great. Okay. Bye
[1344.98 --> 1348.50]  Anyways, it it's actually ridiculous. I i'm talking
[1349.46 --> 1352.50]  multiple years to process paperwork like
[1353.38 --> 1357.14]  wild and and to a point where if you're a small company that like
[1357.14 --> 1362.98]  You know needs to be able to survive over a three or four year period
[1363.22 --> 1367.70]  Sometimes it can literally just crush you and it really really really incentivizes
[1368.34 --> 1374.42]  Being a massive company that can absorb these governmental hits. That's why I wanted to talk about the tax credits
[1374.74 --> 1380.58]  Because as far as I can tell i'm not going to get into the exact details of how long it's taken to process
[1380.58 --> 1383.62]  Uh, there's definitely been delays on our side as well
[1383.62 --> 1386.66]  So i'm not going to act like you know, we've done everything totally perfectly
[1387.70 --> 1388.26]  Yeah, however
[1388.26 --> 1396.82]  However, the amount of bureaucratic red tape does contribute to how long these things do take to collect and submit and
[1396.82 --> 1399.54]  the um
[1399.54 --> 1401.54]  um
[1401.70 --> 1410.90]  The length of time that is spent going back and forth and going through submissions and getting approvals and going through audits
[1411.46 --> 1417.46]  A lot of the time which will need to be done before the payout can actually be made which which makes sense, right?
[1417.46 --> 1422.02]  They it's a lot harder to get money back from someone you issued it to than to just
[1422.50 --> 1425.86]  Not send it to them in the first place especially if it's a significant sum
[1426.34 --> 1426.98]  um
[1426.98 --> 1428.98]  The amount of time that that takes
[1429.54 --> 1434.02]  Makes it feel like to your point that these are designed to help
[1434.74 --> 1437.62]  Big companies that don't need the help nearly as much
[1438.26 --> 1441.86]  Instead of small startups who really need the help
[1442.02 --> 1444.90]  We've talked about this a lot in in the past about about how
[1445.54 --> 1446.58]  um
[1446.58 --> 1450.82]  A lot of these different I I think I was talking specifically about cavco back in the day
[1451.38 --> 1452.42]  but how cavco
[1453.06 --> 1456.82]  very specifically feels like it's built for omega companies and
[1458.26 --> 1465.06]  No, no small companies and it's it's crazy the amount of tax break style stuff that is designed that way
[1465.06 --> 1468.18]  um, I would I would love to just
[1468.90 --> 1470.98]  I would love to understand
[1471.06 --> 1476.02]  Although it would probably not frustrate me any less, but i'd love to understand why this is so inevitable
[1476.58 --> 1480.82]  Because we're talking about the canadian government and you're sitting there at home
[1480.82 --> 1481.86]  in
[1481.86 --> 1483.86]  Wherever the fuck it is that you live going
[1486.66 --> 1489.62]  Because it's the same basically everywhere yeah
[1489.62 --> 1493.70]  Come on money controls money man
[1494.26 --> 1500.10]  Ah drives me crazy in response to the announcement the stock price of china's largest gaming conglomerate
[1500.42 --> 1507.54]  Tencent who by the way, uh also probably owns a very large stake of pretty much every gaming company that is big
[1507.94 --> 1508.34]  Um
[1508.34 --> 1511.22]  Except valve yeah as far as we know I mean they're a private company
[1511.94 --> 1513.54]  True anything's possible but I doubt it
[1513.54 --> 1514.58]  I don't think so yeah
[1515.14 --> 1516.90]  Tencent dropped 16 percent
[1516.90 --> 1518.18]  That's crazy
[1518.18 --> 1523.54]  That's an insane amount and its closest competitor netties dropped 25 percent
[1523.54 --> 1525.86]  That's crazy wild
[1526.34 --> 1532.02]  I think the reason why ten cents wasn't more is because they own such massive portions of american companies
[1532.50 --> 1533.46]  That makes sense
[1533.46 --> 1538.34]  I i i suspect netties is a lot more china-centric
[1538.34 --> 1539.30]  Yeah, I think so
[1540.34 --> 1540.58]  Yeah
[1542.90 --> 1550.82]  Sheesh man and then I think uh is this in our notes because I thought uh the chinese government was looking to walk things back
[1550.82 --> 1553.06]  Oh, uh a little bit
[1553.62 --> 1559.38]  Um based on here based on the impact yeah, that's that's that's not in our notes, but uh apparently china is
[1560.42 --> 1563.62]  Allegedly considering walking back some of these restrictions
[1564.58 --> 1565.14]  Honestly
[1566.98 --> 1573.70]  Please can we just buy once and cry once and and and and do this
[1574.82 --> 1576.98]  Everywhere I have to bring it up every stream
[1578.18 --> 1580.74]  Ballows gate three yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
[1580.82 --> 1583.62]  You can win game of the year and not do these things you can sell
[1584.10 --> 1586.66]  Unlimited copies of your game when I go on steam
[1586.98 --> 1593.30]  You know how when you look at your your games list you can see little green heads when people are playing certain games
[1594.50 --> 1599.54]  The only one that shows one is ballers gate three ever I highlight over it's like five different people
[1600.10 --> 1601.14]  They're not playing together
[1601.78 --> 1605.54]  They're all in different parts. Sometimes they'll be in parties, but they're not in each other's parties
[1605.54 --> 1607.46]  I know these people separately they don't know each other
[1607.46 --> 1611.22]  There's people always playing that game. It's still killing it
[1611.94 --> 1618.50]  It's been out for a while. Yeah, and it's still killing it and it doesn't have this stuff. You don't have to do it. Please stop
[1619.30 --> 1624.10]  But I I mean I wasn't even talking about asking the gaming companies to stop doing it because they won't
[1624.10 --> 1628.90]  Yeah, like if if you like look here hold on let's let's play a game
[1629.70 --> 1631.70]  What are we doing?
[1632.02 --> 1634.02]  oh
[1634.98 --> 1636.42]  oh
[1636.50 --> 1638.50]  Okay, he's getting a controller
[1639.30 --> 1640.50]  Okay
[1640.50 --> 1641.30]  A gold one
[1641.86 --> 1645.70]  Okay, I've got a golden game controller. Yeah, okay, very nice
[1646.90 --> 1651.46]  To make this a skin to make money all you have to do is press this button
[1654.02 --> 1656.02]  Go ahead
[1656.26 --> 1660.50]  Right here. Oh wow. Oh wow. Is he gonna throw his wallet?
[1660.82 --> 1664.74]  We're making it real. No, no, we're making it real. Oh, wow. Oh, I don't have any cash
[1664.74 --> 1668.02]  I was gonna actually hand him money here. I can
[1668.90 --> 1672.98]  Well, no, that's that's not the point. That's not the point. I was gonna I was gonna let you know
[1676.42 --> 1678.42]  I want to invest in this
[1678.82 --> 1680.82]  Get me stock
[1680.82 --> 1684.74]  Oh, I got the mic. Oh, Jesus. I got cash right here. Come on
[1687.94 --> 1694.18]  Anyway, the point is from the gaming company's standpoint, what do they care? I mean their own employees are just numbers
[1694.74 --> 1696.26]  Never mind the customers
[1696.26 --> 1700.10]  So if all they have to do is press a button to make bank
[1700.42 --> 1704.26]  Well, why don't they just keep pressing the button? They're not gonna stop it has to be regulatory
[1704.26 --> 1708.82]  Especially once tencent owns a huge portion of your company anyways, and you have to report to shareholders
[1708.82 --> 1712.50]  And I get it the the you know, the the small government, you know
[1712.82 --> 1720.10]  Libertarian crowd is gonna say well, you know, that's on that's on people for you know, being gullible or whatever or something, but it's
[1720.66 --> 1723.46]  It's never that black and white. It's not that black and white
[1723.46 --> 1730.02]  We actually do need regulations to keep people from dumping carcinogenic chemicals in your in your streams because
[1730.50 --> 1736.98]  We've proven time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again that otherwise they will just do it
[1737.54 --> 1742.80]  Yeah, and like they're using they're using psychology and they're they're abusing people's you know
[1743.28 --> 1746.58]  vulnerabilities here. Yeah, and you could be you could be vulnerable
[1746.58 --> 1751.38]  They're a breeze abusing your lizard brain that still wants the shiny thing
[1751.38 --> 1758.66]  You can be vulnerable to getting cancer and you can be equally vulnerable to being manipulated into gambling away your life savings
[1758.82 --> 1760.82]  Yeah, and it's it's a
[1761.94 --> 1762.82]  spectacularly
[1763.46 --> 1767.38]  Sophisticated machine at this point a lot more so than I think a lot of people
[1768.10 --> 1776.34]  Realize or or potentially are willing to accept yeah, or there are billions of dollars every year that go into controlling what your brain does
[1776.98 --> 1781.54]  Or even you to keep scrolling getting you to buy more skins getting you to keep playing getting you to do whatever
[1781.78 --> 1785.46]  Yeah, and like every once in a while a scandal breaks, right?
[1785.46 --> 1791.30]  Like there was those those couple of streamers that got caught owning the gambling site
[1791.70 --> 1796.10]  that they were supposedly gambling and winning on all day on their streams and
[1796.66 --> 1802.02]  They ended up getting a slap on the wrist and we've all kind of forgotten about every time something like that gets exposed
[1802.02 --> 1806.98]  At least one of them still makes videos. Yeah every time something like that gets exposed
[1807.62 --> 1808.10]  um
[1808.10 --> 1815.94]  There was I guarantee you there was another 10 or another hundred that didn't get exposed whether it was because it was a lower profile
[1816.66 --> 1823.78]  Person who was doing it or whether they didn't get you know siphon quite as much money away from people or whether they just
[1823.78 --> 1826.82]  Were slicker and got away with it. Um
[1828.10 --> 1830.10]  I
[1830.90 --> 1832.90]  I just
[1834.66 --> 1835.46]  Yeah
[1835.46 --> 1840.90]  Gross i'm stoked about this. I think this is really cool. I'd love to see everywhere do it like immediately
[1841.22 --> 1846.90]  Yeah, but instead like I don't I don't know what the canadian government is busy doing right now
[1846.90 --> 1853.78]  Apparently covering up their spy program. It turns out you saw that the michaels it turns out they were spies. Oh, yeah
[1855.62 --> 1858.42]  So, I don't know about you, but i'm pretty picked off right now. Yeah
[1859.06 --> 1860.18]  um
[1860.18 --> 1868.98]  Hmm. Yeah, I I honestly I I feel like I live in america because I have two terrible options for our federal federal government
[1869.54 --> 1874.74]  Oh, yeah, like honestly like i'm sitting here feeling completely and utterly betrayed by the liberals
[1874.74 --> 1879.38]  Yeah, and looking at the conservatives in different ways. Wow. This is uh
[1879.94 --> 1884.02]  This is this is not better. This is concern. Where's my first pass the post mr. Trudeau
[1884.90 --> 1892.42]  Yeah, yeah, where's anything yeah, horrible like I yeah, I don't know but no I completely agree like what
[1893.06 --> 1897.38]  We choose let's vote for the like random stick in the forest. It'll probably do a better job
[1897.78 --> 1898.90]  um
[1898.90 --> 1904.18]  Uh if you want to have some fun going down a rabbit hole i've been dropping a lot of rabbit holes lately look up the
[1904.74 --> 1906.74]  Canadian spy palace
[1907.70 --> 1910.98]  Have I told you about this probably yeah, it's amazing
[1911.78 --> 1915.22]  It's like one of the coolest looking buildings we have in canada at all
[1915.70 --> 1924.18]  Um, it cost almost a trillion dollars it costs 880 million dollars and in canada that's a lot. We don't have that much money
[1924.58 --> 1928.34]  um, so yeah, it's very interesting. Um
[1928.34 --> 1931.30]  Oh
[1931.30 --> 1932.18]  man, very cool
[1933.14 --> 1935.94]  You know, we had someone internally. Um
[1938.18 --> 1940.98]  Actually, uh, this isn't that relevant. It doesn't really matter the point is
[1941.62 --> 1948.10]  I uh, i'm feeling very frustrated. I have absolutely no idea what to do in the next federal election
[1948.10 --> 1949.46]  It's like, what do I do vote ndp?
[1950.26 --> 1951.54]  like honestly
[1952.50 --> 1952.82]  yeah
[1954.18 --> 1954.66]  I don't know
[1955.38 --> 1957.54]  I don't know like all right. I don't know
[1958.74 --> 1962.90]  Oh, i've i've i've actually been I I was literally
[1963.86 --> 1965.38]  I came in after a very long walk
[1966.26 --> 1970.26]  And I sat down for a sec and was just like staring at the floor thinking
[1970.90 --> 1972.18]  Yeah, what the hell do I do?
[1972.82 --> 1975.46]  I just not vote i've always voted before
[1975.46 --> 1982.58]  I had uh, I had a really frustrating conversation with like a boomer acquaintance of mine
[1983.22 --> 1985.38]  um, where basically, uh
[1986.50 --> 1990.58]  This person is is very billion dollars. Oh, oops. Yeah dirt
[1991.54 --> 1995.30]  Yeah, I misspoke. Anyways, this person is very sort of pro
[1995.70 --> 1998.42]  um residential real estate as an investment
[1999.70 --> 2004.98]  And um, you know what yeah, we're you're gonna you're gonna hear what might sound to you like
[2004.98 --> 2010.98]  Political positions, but these are not really political if you if you can take off the political hat for a little bit
[2011.62 --> 2014.58]  And and just kind of look at the facts
[2015.14 --> 2017.14]  um
[2017.14 --> 2021.78]  Investment in residential real estate only makes sense if it always go up
[2024.02 --> 2028.02]  If it always go up, then that means cost of living
[2028.66 --> 2030.66]  always go up
[2030.66 --> 2036.66]  Which is bad for anyone who isn't a landowner the land owning class
[2037.46 --> 2038.58]  is now
[2038.58 --> 2044.58]  Grossly disproportionately older people with younger people being unable to get in because
[2045.30 --> 2047.30]  always go up and
[2047.46 --> 2048.26]  No
[2048.26 --> 2053.86]  Landlords are not providing a service what they are doing if they own more than one property is
[2054.42 --> 2057.38]  Holding property in hopes that it go up
[2057.38 --> 2059.38]  Um, and
[2059.38 --> 2065.62]  I guess what's frustrating for me is looking at everyone's brilliant plan in canada
[2065.62 --> 2070.98]  We have a housing affordability crisis that is maybe rivaled by australia
[2071.62 --> 2077.30]  Um, really? Oh, it's yeah, it's awful down there. I didn't know that. Yeah, it's really rough for all of the same reasons
[2077.86 --> 2081.46]  Starting at around the same time around 30 to 40 years ago
[2082.10 --> 2085.94]  Um, just they they stopped investing in social housing. They started
[2085.94 --> 2088.74]  Um providing tax benefits for
[2089.30 --> 2094.18]  Or tax loopholes essentially uh for investments into residential property
[2094.90 --> 2100.34]  Um, they haven't done enough to regulate corporations buying residential property and then that's the worst part
[2100.34 --> 2104.18]  Ren evicting people and like all that kind of stuff some random individual owning like
[2104.82 --> 2105.46]  uh
[2105.46 --> 2110.02]  Their first property still and owning a second property and renting out their first one doesn't seem that bad to me
[2110.02 --> 2116.26]  Compared to giant corporations owning multiple entire apartment buildings and city blocks and all this kind of stuff
[2116.26 --> 2119.78]  It's like whoa, okay, um because well, it's and it's about control, right?
[2119.78 --> 2121.94]  Um, anyway, the point is that like
[2122.50 --> 2125.94]  It's been so frustrating for me seeing the the regulatory
[2126.42 --> 2130.98]  Attempts at fixing this problem when the answer is so obvious you just need to
[2131.94 --> 2132.98]  Tax the ever-loving
[2132.98 --> 2137.06]  Out of multiple property ownership and it can be a sliding scale
[2137.06 --> 2143.30]  Yeah, like you need a place to live that should be super low if you have an investment property or vacation property
[2143.30 --> 2145.38]  The reality of it is you're doing pretty good
[2145.62 --> 2146.98]  Yeah, and it should go up a lot
[2147.22 --> 2152.10]  Yeah, and by the time you're looking at three or four just that should be pretty much a straight line
[2152.10 --> 2153.06]  To the moon
[2153.06 --> 2155.46]  Uh because to the moon it's just common sense
[2155.94 --> 2159.86]  You know you don't get to line up for the buffet again until everybody's got a plate
[2159.86 --> 2167.14]  Because if there isn't enough for everyone to have seconds then everyone's got to have firsts first
[2167.38 --> 2170.90]  Yeah, and everyone's one being very affordable
[2171.70 --> 2179.62]  Model would be fantastic in my opinion. We also have an issue where we have we have this is getting spicy, but I can I talk about the regulations first?
[2179.62 --> 2179.94]  Yes
[2179.94 --> 2182.90]  Have you seen some of the some of the proposed like bull crap?
[2183.54 --> 2187.78]  Like oh, how about how about how about rent subsidies to people who can't afford rent?
[2187.78 --> 2195.14]  That's not gonna help. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did you landlords did you did you just propose taking public funding?
[2196.18 --> 2198.42]  And giving it to landowners? Yeah
[2199.78 --> 2205.94]  I I says fucking part that's brutal too because that will probably just result in rent going up in price as well
[2206.34 --> 2208.74]  Of course it will because they know you have more money of course
[2208.74 --> 2211.70]  It will more competitive because the higher the prices go
[2212.34 --> 2219.22]  The more the more risk the the people who want to get into land ownership are taking and the bigger their mortgages are
[2219.62 --> 2226.74]  And the the bigger the disaster when the whole thing comes crumbling down like it's this it's this gigantic house of cards that i've been waiting my entire
[2227.38 --> 2228.82]  adult life
[2228.82 --> 2234.90]  For it to collapse because it's just ridiculous. Oh, and it just never does the new thing is our our province
[2234.90 --> 2241.46]  This is amazing our provincial government just mandated that you cannot have single family zoning anymore
[2241.70 --> 2242.82]  Yeah, so
[2242.82 --> 2248.90]  Everything every single single family plot in the entire province can now be a development opportunity
[2248.90 --> 2251.70]  Which on the face of it sounds great for affordability?
[2251.94 --> 2256.98]  Because all of a sudden it means that any property large enough could have a duplex a triplex a quadruplex
[2256.98 --> 2258.82]  I mean whatever right? I think it's up to six
[2258.82 --> 2262.90]  Something like that don't don't quote me on that but more than more than one
[2262.90 --> 2264.90]  Except for a couple small problems
[2265.46 --> 2268.26]  In the areas where the affordability is worst
[2268.82 --> 2275.94]  The infrastructure is not set up for that not even close not even close. We don't we a don't have parking and b don't have rapid transit
[2276.26 --> 2278.98]  So I mean the roads are broken too
[2279.62 --> 2281.94]  That's that that's the yes. Yes
[2282.66 --> 2283.94]  like everything is
[2284.50 --> 2291.70]  um, and then and then number two is that hospitals that doesn't actually help with the affordability of the places
[2291.70 --> 2295.62]  We have now because it turns every single single family
[2296.50 --> 2301.70]  Zoned property into a development opportunity and as soon as you have individuals
[2302.26 --> 2304.26]  bidding on a property against
[2304.98 --> 2308.98]  Corporations who are going to develop it for profit you have a problem
[2310.02 --> 2313.86]  They are not gonna I talked about this before when I talked about all the veterinary practices
[2313.94 --> 2318.34]  In the lower mainland getting bought up all the independent ones so that eventually
[2318.98 --> 2322.66]  These I think there's one or two big companies that are buying them all
[2323.22 --> 2328.82]  Eventually, they control the market and then they can just drive pricing up and the higher the pricing goes the higher the rents go
[2328.82 --> 2333.30]  It's everyone wants every landlord wants rent to cover the mortgage
[2334.02 --> 2334.82]  So to say
[2335.62 --> 2342.50]  Anything else that somehow it will help affordability for there to be more landlords or something else is frankly asinine. I'm sorry
[2343.22 --> 2345.22]  What were you gonna say we have?
[2345.22 --> 2350.58]  We have we have we were talking about regulation issues earlier in the show about how it takes way too long to get approved on things
[2351.06 --> 2359.14]  I was um, I was saunaing after the gym a while back talking to someone who works in the the the contractor industry
[2359.38 --> 2361.38]  they sell windows
[2361.70 --> 2363.94]  To companies that are building buildings
[2364.50 --> 2369.54]  Um, that's their whole thing and they were they were talking about how there are projects that they've been
[2370.10 --> 2372.10]  That they have had fully planned out
[2372.90 --> 2378.82]  And like when you when you already know the exact say the exact size shape and quantity of every single window
[2379.70 --> 2384.02]  Your buildings pretty much planned so like that he knows how far along the process is
[2384.02 --> 2390.58]  At that stage they have to wait often an additional three or four years sometimes before they can break ground
[2390.82 --> 2393.94]  Which means there's also more time when they have to actually build the thing
[2394.50 --> 2394.74]  um
[2395.94 --> 2396.74]  That's happening
[2396.74 --> 2399.54]  We have this problem where it's very difficult to build things
[2400.58 --> 2405.62]  And you know what sometimes it should be because you don't want people just making terrible buildings cough cop
[2406.50 --> 2410.66]  Pipes have burst in my building like four times since i've been there and i've only been there for like three or four years
[2411.22 --> 2411.46]  um
[2412.98 --> 2416.74]  But we have this issue where it's taking forever to be able to build anything and then we have
[2417.78 --> 2421.46]  by a huge margin absolute record levels of immigration
[2421.94 --> 2427.06]  So canada's population overall is going up a bunch yeah like crazy very very very high
[2427.70 --> 2429.54]  and the new housing
[2429.54 --> 2434.34]  Is really slow so we're not matching that yeah, so
[2434.98 --> 2438.26]  Don't forget about interest rates everyone here across the board
[2438.98 --> 2444.66]  Is having a really really really hard time getting into property ownership. It's extremely difficult to rent
[2445.38 --> 2451.54]  And that's getting worse because the new housing versus population lines are not going together. It's supply and demand
[2451.78 --> 2456.98]  Yeah, and like i've got people talking in the chat about how this is such a political conversation. It's math isn't political
[2456.98 --> 2461.14]  If you think it's political you're wrong supply of housing
[2461.70 --> 2465.06]  Is not going up as fast as amount of people is going up?
[2465.06 --> 2469.06]  It doesn't matter what the source of amount of people is this could be new births
[2469.06 --> 2474.98]  This could be immigration. This could be people teleporting here from mars. It could be families who used to live together getting mad at each other
[2475.54 --> 2479.86]  And wanting to live separately. It doesn't matter people just growing up and moving away from home it
[2479.86 --> 2484.74]  It I don't care what the source of this number is the new housing is not matching it
[2486.74 --> 2489.94]  And that that's just that's very rough because it it
[2492.74 --> 2496.58]  It's supporting this bubble right it's not allowing this bubble to blow up
[2497.86 --> 2500.34]  I uh as a as a property owner
[2500.98 --> 2505.54]  I am rooting hard for a crash me too. I want a big one. Yep
[2505.54 --> 2509.78]  Not because it's not going to be painful not because
[2510.66 --> 2512.34]  uh, i'm down hurt me
[2514.02 --> 2515.22]  like
[2515.22 --> 2517.22]  Because it needs to happen
[2517.70 --> 2521.70]  It needed to happen a long time ago. It should have happened 10 15 years ago
[2522.10 --> 2526.34]  The fact that we've let it go for so long means it's going to be more painful
[2526.34 --> 2532.02]  So the reason i'm rooting for it is because it's only going to get worse when it finally happens. Yep
[2532.02 --> 2534.02]  Oh
[2534.58 --> 2537.70]  Anyway, good luck everybody. Sorry. This is not really the topic
[2538.98 --> 2540.50]  the point is that uh
[2541.78 --> 2543.06]  That hey china
[2543.78 --> 2549.06]  Don't agree with everything that's going on over there, but uh definitely super into the whole
[2550.26 --> 2556.74]  Banning gambling and video games and limiting people's ability to just blow their life savings on on gacha games
[2557.06 --> 2561.70]  It's an interesting trend that's been going on. Uh, apparently japan is getting in on this too
[2562.50 --> 2565.38]  various countries around the world cranking down on
[2566.18 --> 2568.18]  tech in general
[2568.50 --> 2573.70]  As a as with their governmental bodies so speaking of china by the way apparently
[2574.90 --> 2580.58]  This video on billy billy. I don't know how to read um view counts here
[2581.54 --> 2585.30]  Um, but I think this is 1.6 million views
[2586.18 --> 2589.38]  Oh, wow. Oh, this is the tv. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[2589.38 --> 2592.74]  This is the unboxing of the gigantic tcl tv
[2593.54 --> 2593.86]  um
[2594.58 --> 2596.50]  Someone someone flagged this to me
[2597.30 --> 2599.38]  Internally that we uh, oh, no, is this it?
[2602.02 --> 2607.14]  Uh, yeah, it doesn't translate numbers though. I don't think oh, yeah. Oh 1.8 million wow
[2608.18 --> 2608.50]  wow
[2609.62 --> 2611.22]  That is freaking crazy
[2611.22 --> 2617.38]  Yeah, so hey shout out uh shout out the billy billy audience. We have a uh, we have a translation team
[2618.18 --> 2618.58]  um
[2619.22 --> 2626.66]  That uh, it's the same team, right? Well, they've cycled through some members, but it's yeah, it's the same. Um, it's the same team
[2626.66 --> 2629.38]  Oh, here we go. That's cool. Uh, nixie subs. Oh, look at that. Look
[2629.38 --> 2632.66]  What's the they have uh, they have a recruitment url right here
[2634.10 --> 2636.66]  Long-term recruitment of paid translators. Yes, there you go
[2636.98 --> 2642.74]  So yeah, we we do we we took someone who was a group that was pirating our videos and uploading them to billy billy and we're like, okay
[2642.74 --> 2644.74]  Look, you can't do that
[2644.82 --> 2648.42]  But we understand that maybe people want to watch the videos over there. So how about this?
[2648.82 --> 2653.46]  Well, we will pay you and you can upload them and then we'll we'll just do it that way um
[2653.46 --> 2660.26]  Um, and it's been fine. We haven't made any money. It's mostly been just like a a service
[2660.82 --> 2666.74]  For the people who want to watch over there because as far as I can tell you can't buy anything from ltd store
[2667.46 --> 2673.30]  In china, I don't probably not. I well, man now now i'm kind of curious. What if you shipped internally?
[2674.82 --> 2676.02]  Internally
[2676.18 --> 2678.18]  What if you
[2680.50 --> 2682.50]  Oh, here here we go sessions by location
[2682.50 --> 2684.50]  Uh
[2687.38 --> 2691.22]  Would they have to to go to lttstore.com? I think so really
[2692.58 --> 2695.62]  Speaking of not approving of everything china does. I don't know 100%
[2695.86 --> 2699.30]  It's been a long time since i've looked into how the firewall works. That's pretty stupid
[2700.18 --> 2701.30]  um, anywho
[2702.82 --> 2703.22]  uh
[2704.50 --> 2709.38]  Yeah, I don't know it hasn't shown up in the first 400 results, which I think is an indication that probably
[2710.02 --> 2713.86]  Oh, yeah, we had six visitors from china there. It is six visitors from china today
[2713.86 --> 2714.26]  Hong kong
[2714.26 --> 2720.74]  I don't know doesn't say um, yeah, so and and we we have no way to get the money out of our billy billy account
[2720.74 --> 2727.70]  Uh, last time I checked with yvonne. I think it was 40 000 sitting in the account there
[2728.02 --> 2728.42]  so a
[2728.42 --> 2732.02]  very significant amount of money, uh, but hey
[2732.58 --> 2733.14]  my
[2733.14 --> 2740.74]  Honestly, one of my reasons for not being willing to travel to china was that the canadian government told me that china arbitrarily
[2740.74 --> 2745.86]  Detained the two michaels now that I know that one of them spies one of them was a spy
[2745.86 --> 2749.70]  And the other one was kind of like drawn into it by the other one is what they're alleging right now
[2749.70 --> 2753.14]  It's this is all kind of being aired in public finally
[2753.54 --> 2758.90]  Now that I know that china was like justified in detaining them. It's like yeah, maybe i'll go there and open a bank account
[2758.90 --> 2760.90]  I'm not a spy
[2761.46 --> 2763.46]  Yeah
[2763.46 --> 2768.26]  Oh, man, then again. They might be mad that I smuggled that tv out like maybe i'm on a list
[2769.22 --> 2773.46]  I'm probably on some kind of list. I mean i'm pretty sure they have lists of just about everybody again
[2773.94 --> 2776.10]  We say taiwan a lot not saying I approve
[2778.90 --> 2781.86]  Chinese taipei luke no no i know
[2783.78 --> 2789.14]  That's such a that's such a stupid name. It's like me, you know, there's more than one city in taiwan
[2790.26 --> 2791.46]  Yeah
[2791.46 --> 2797.14]  It's like it's like what if i'm from uh, oh crap. You never been to tainan bro. Yeah
[2797.14 --> 2801.06]  Yeah, it's like if i'm from there what I I you know, I'm at the olympics. I'm representing
[2801.78 --> 2803.78]  You know in the wallian. Yeah
[2803.86 --> 2807.06]  Yeah, I was like come on guys. There's a lot of cool places. Don't want ridiculous
[2809.62 --> 2811.62]  Um
[2811.62 --> 2815.86]  What are we even talking about we're supposed to explain merch messages what even is the show today?
[2816.50 --> 2818.50]  We made it through like
[2818.50 --> 2822.26]  I don't know but my social credit score is probably at an all-time low right now
[2822.90 --> 2824.18]  Yeah, yeah, oh
[2824.18 --> 2830.18]  Oh, I have the solution. Okay, okay. We can fix this. I can smooth things over with the chinese government
[2830.66 --> 2832.98]  And I can fix the housing crisis
[2833.62 --> 2839.22]  Everyone who doesn't have a house in vancouver can just move to a ghost city in china. Oh
[2839.22 --> 2841.38]  Oh, everyone wins. It's genius
[2843.38 --> 2851.06]  Amazing slash s yeah for anyone taking that seriously. Someone probably shake shake your head. Someone probably did slash s. Yeah, okay
[2852.34 --> 2854.34]  Checkmate
[2855.46 --> 2856.74]  All right, we're supposed to explain
[2856.74 --> 2858.50]  Merch messages
[2858.50 --> 2862.58]  The way the way to talk to the show is not super chats. It's not
[2863.06 --> 2870.10]  Uh twitch bits. It's merch messages you go on lttstore.com find something that you like head to the checkout
[2870.10 --> 2873.62]  And you'll see a little box for a merch message whether you want to pick up one of our
[2873.94 --> 2878.02]  Uh new stubby screwdrivers or the shaft extensions that turn them
[2878.02 --> 2888.34]  Into what I call the compensator screwdriver
[2888.90 --> 2890.02]  Eh, eh
[2891.54 --> 2892.34]  Pretty cute
[2893.06 --> 2896.98]  Anyway, the point is uh, you add that to your cart and there's a little box you fill that out
[2896.98 --> 2902.82]  You leave us a merch message. It'll go to producer dan who will I hope sorry. Sorry. Go ahead and wave. Sorry. Oh, sorry
[2902.82 --> 2904.10]  Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, sorry
[2904.10 --> 2911.62]  Uh, go to producer dan, um, who will reply to you or forward it to someone who can answer your question or direct it to me and luke
[2911.94 --> 2913.30]  Here on the show
[2913.86 --> 2918.74]  Uh, we're gonna go through a couple to kind of show you guys how it works and also there's a merch update
[2919.30 --> 2923.14]  We are trialing a promotion. What does that even mean?
[2924.18 --> 2925.22]  Oh
[2925.22 --> 2926.90]  This is cool
[2926.90 --> 2928.90]  We're oh, we're collaborating
[2928.90 --> 2930.90]  Oh, okay. This is the first i'm hearing of this
[2930.90 --> 2937.14]  If you buy a desk pad, you get a ten dollar code with green man gaming
[2937.54 --> 2943.46]  Oh, so you buy any desk pad on ltdstore.com excluding mystery desk pads and use code
[2944.74 --> 2947.14]  gmg10 at checkout and you'll get a code
[2948.02 --> 2951.06]  Uh, this is a trial run on our side. Ah, this is what makes it a trial
[2951.46 --> 2957.46]  Um, so the codes will not be sent automatically at the time of purchase our support team is going to have to do this manually
[2957.46 --> 2960.58]  Oh, but they will be sent out to all buyers by january 4th
[2961.30 --> 2962.42]  So that's six days
[2962.98 --> 2968.90]  Yeah, have fun. Yeah, that's not too bad. So how long is this uh, is this on for we're don't we're only doing 300 codes
[2969.46 --> 2972.82]  To kind of keep things from the indication when it ends
[2973.78 --> 2975.78]  Luke do I look like I know things?
[2976.34 --> 2977.22]  Sometimes okay
[2977.78 --> 2980.26]  Sometimes look look I have a whale on my shirt
[2980.26 --> 2988.98]  Oh, speaking of which ah, we did a tour. Yeah, we did a tour today of the land center
[2989.30 --> 2994.34]  Dan saw it for the first time so we can we can talk about it. Yeah, we'll talk about that later
[2994.34 --> 2995.94]  We'll do a couple of messages right now
[2996.18 --> 3002.18]  Um, as for whether there's an indicator. I have no idea. So good luck everyone. I'm sure if we accidentally sell
[3002.74 --> 3003.86]  322
[3003.86 --> 3009.30]  Uh, we will get you sorted out. Trust me, bro. Don't worry. It's all good. Uh, you get ten dollars off on green man gaming
[3009.30 --> 3011.38]  Um, all right. Oh, yeah
[3011.78 --> 3012.82]  Other news
[3012.82 --> 3017.70]  Noctua screwdrivers have started shipping. So if you were holding off due to it being a pre-sale
[3017.70 --> 3020.02]  You can now place an order and expect it to ship within a few days
[3021.38 --> 3025.78]  I have received I've been mostly i've been on vacation this week. I've been mostly disconnected, but
[3026.26 --> 3029.78]  Some communication that I have received is that there's a lot of people that want stubbies of it
[3031.86 --> 3033.22]  Stubby is selling okay
[3033.54 --> 3037.94]  What I told the people who wanted other colors of stubby in the past was if stubby is a success
[3037.94 --> 3039.94]  Then you can expect to see more colorways
[3040.34 --> 3045.30]  Um, it's more work than you probably think to do a new colorway of something you have to validate the mold
[3045.54 --> 3047.94]  And there is a different mold for the handle for stubby
[3047.94 --> 3051.70]  So you have to validate the mold for the uh, the different composition of the plastic and that's
[3052.66 --> 3055.06]  That's the big one. Um, so it's not just strength
[3055.06 --> 3060.66]  It's also whether you're going to get weird swirls in the in the coloration and just all this crap because the whole like flow
[3060.90 --> 3064.18]  Simulation thing is not always perfect. Sometimes the real world is messy
[3064.18 --> 3069.62]  Um, so if stubby continues to be a success and we move through the black ones
[3069.62 --> 3072.50]  It is possible that we will do other colors of stubby
[3072.50 --> 3074.66]  But for now if you want to stubby
[3074.98 --> 3080.26]  This is the color that the stubby screwdriver is in and i'm not going to guarantee that we will do anything else
[3082.34 --> 3088.50]  All right, dan sure as we're talking about merch magnetic cable holders estimated time of arrival
[3088.50 --> 3098.66]  Am I ever am I gonna avoid answering this question every week you're allowed to soon soon tm darn it?
[3098.66 --> 3100.66]  I believe
[3100.66 --> 3105.54]  Oh, man, do I have uh, is nick off this week? I don't remember getting a merch
[3106.18 --> 3110.82]  Update from nick. Uh, nick. Hold on. Hold on. Let me let me see. Let me see
[3110.82 --> 3116.74]  I don't want to throw them under the bus or anything here literal second that they're available. I'm putting in a request. Yes, I know. I know
[3116.74 --> 3124.74]  Uh, okay, uh, the last excited i'm probably gonna put in multiple well one request of multiple units
[3124.74 --> 3126.98]  I guess probably because I want to do it for
[3128.34 --> 3134.02]  Uh, my my pc setup, but also home theater pending packing at our
[3134.66 --> 3137.70]  Um at our distribution center expected to go live
[3140.26 --> 3142.26]  Mid to late january
[3142.42 --> 3144.58]  All right. Oh, you happy?
[3144.58 --> 3147.22]  Hype, hype, hype, hype, hype, hype, hype, hype, you happy?
[3147.70 --> 3150.10]  Okay, they're so good. Okay, what else you got?
[3150.66 --> 3152.74]  Uh, sorry. I was distracted by the news
[3153.30 --> 3157.06]  Uh, let's see hey when dot i'm not even gonna do
[3159.38 --> 3165.06]  We're going with all the weird ones apparently the creator of the png says it's ping ping no it's ping
[3165.06 --> 3168.98]  What are you swedish? I'm going with ping
[3170.10 --> 3175.38]  Also, uh, to kind of call back god. I hate this to call back from uh from I think it was last week
[3175.54 --> 3179.78]  Um, apparently the xc anything is more of an english thing which explains a lot. Oh
[3180.50 --> 3182.10]  It explains so much
[3182.10 --> 3184.90]  Everybody who's like I do that i'm like are you english and they're like yeah, why?
[3184.90 --> 3186.90]  I'm like aha
[3186.90 --> 3188.50]  Because you you grew up there is that right?
[3188.50 --> 3195.14]  My dad's english. I was born there and moved here, but yeah, I mean I say doing the washing up and washing up liquid
[3195.14 --> 3196.02]  Yeah, which always gets laughs
[3196.66 --> 3198.34]  Uh, okay. Hey, wan dot dll
[3198.58 --> 3203.86]  Do you guys have any projects you're looking forward to in 24 24 or any goals you want to accomplish projects?
[3204.18 --> 3206.10]  Yeah, oh like work projects
[3206.90 --> 3211.46]  Uh, there's one big one. I can't talk to you guys about maybe maybe private projects too
[3211.46 --> 3217.30]  The thing sent you a video on it. Oh that yeah, oh, okay
[3217.30 --> 3220.34]  Well, we can provide some vague information. Not really
[3221.38 --> 3227.46]  Just vague though. Nah. I think how about you linus? I think that if we're sufficiently vague, it should be fine
[3227.78 --> 3230.58]  Or we just not we want to help people nah
[3233.06 --> 3235.14]  Nobody's getting help we want to help people yeah
[3237.86 --> 3239.86]  That is sufficiently vague
[3240.50 --> 3242.74]  With information that's we can
[3243.62 --> 3248.58]  With information we want to help them with information that is that is may I remind you about the
[3249.46 --> 3251.46]  The mission statement. Oh, yeah
[3252.18 --> 3252.66]  Nice
[3253.38 --> 3255.78]  What I have that no you don't get to mute
[3258.66 --> 3265.06]  I can unplug you too, sir. I will figure out which cable is your is your stream deck
[3265.06 --> 3267.06]  Oh
[3278.34 --> 3281.86]  My god, these are the people that employ me
[3284.66 --> 3286.66]  Bunch of children
[3286.66 --> 3287.22]  Oh, man
[3290.18 --> 3296.82]  I'm back. I'm back first. I'm back. I'm back, baby. I'm back better. Oh, my laptop actually went to sleep darn it
[3298.10 --> 3298.98]  I'm back more
[3300.50 --> 3301.06]  It's great
[3302.02 --> 3309.14]  Um, what were we even saying? Oh, yeah, merch message. I I mean, I have projects. I have a defense against that go go ahead try and close my laptop
[3309.14 --> 3311.14]  Go ahead
[3311.14 --> 3313.54]  Go ahead. No, go ahead and try. I feel personally attacked
[3313.54 --> 3314.98]  I don't know how much I want to try
[3314.98 --> 3316.66]  Go ahead and try. Yeah, just go ahead and try
[3317.62 --> 3319.62]  I call this the fisting defense
[3333.30 --> 3336.34]  I was gonna say if I push too hard to break it and then I
[3338.02 --> 3340.66]  That's why it's the fisting defense. I know Dan
[3343.30 --> 3345.30]  Oh, man
[3345.30 --> 3345.86]  Anywho
[3345.86 --> 3346.98]  Uh, uh
[3346.98 --> 3348.42]  Projects that we're looking for
[3348.42 --> 3348.90]  That's not what I meant
[3348.90 --> 3351.70]  Yeah, so we're looking to help people
[3352.10 --> 3353.38]  Um, so that's what luke's
[3354.02 --> 3355.14]  Yeah, it's gonna be working on
[3355.14 --> 3360.42]  Yeah, um, and then one of the teams on our side. I'm i'm really excited to get some more
[3361.14 --> 3362.82]  um circuits launched
[3363.06 --> 3368.82]  It looks like the way that we're gonna brand the um, the vertical specific channels
[3368.82 --> 3369.94]  Oh, I can say so
[3369.94 --> 3375.06]  Um, that the labs data is gonna help us to create is like power supply circuit motherboard
[3375.06 --> 3375.62]  circuit
[3376.02 --> 3379.30]  Um, the the labs team has continued
[3379.30 --> 3387.94]  To beaver away on testing methodologies and all that good stuff in the background while they've been pitching in on videos here and there
[3387.94 --> 3388.82]  um
[3388.82 --> 3391.06]  And it looks like
[3391.06 --> 3392.50]  It looks like this year
[3392.50 --> 3394.90]  You can expect to see some channels
[3394.90 --> 3398.18]  I think it's probably gonna start with power supply circuit
[3398.66 --> 3403.46]  It's possible something else will beat it across the finish line, but um, lucas from the lab
[3403.62 --> 3404.58]  um, gary
[3404.58 --> 3411.86]  Um, honestly, the whole team there has been working really hard to get our power supply testing methodology up to snuff
[3412.34 --> 3414.90]  And our hope is that once we've got
[3415.78 --> 3418.26]  Everything up and running so we have the new loads, um
[3418.26 --> 3420.82]  Um, uh loads load units from chroma
[3420.82 --> 3427.46]  Uh, those are installed now we have the final scope we have the parameters basically nailed down
[3427.46 --> 3430.74]  I think um, I think right now it's just pending some
[3431.38 --> 3436.74]  Some vacation time because it's you know got a holiday season and then people are out right now
[3436.74 --> 3437.86]  Yeah, in the new year
[3438.82 --> 3444.50]  In the new year, I think we are going to be ramping up testing. I already saw like man
[3446.02 --> 3447.14]  The goal at the start
[3447.78 --> 3453.14]  For the videos is going to be pretty low production value like it is possible
[3453.78 --> 3459.22]  That we are just going to have a template script, you know, and it's going to be kind of like um
[3459.78 --> 3463.78]  What's it called like mad libs almost where it's going to be like, okay, this is the
[3463.78 --> 3473.14]  Blank watts from blank manufacturer and the just kind of you know lays out what the the one pager
[3473.94 --> 3476.90]  Test report is going to be in video script form
[3477.14 --> 3480.90]  We're basically going to have like a template of what the shots
[3481.46 --> 3486.66]  That accompany each portion of the video are supposed to be what graphs go where and just
[3487.14 --> 3490.82]  As simple as humanly possible just get information out there because there's
[3491.38 --> 3493.62]  Not a lot of coverage of this stuff anymore
[3494.10 --> 3498.66]  Like I was looking I was trying to look for just like an unboxing and overview of some
[3498.66 --> 3503.62]  EVGA power supply as part of this the research for starting up this channel like you know
[3503.62 --> 3506.90]  How many views does a power supply video get these days and the answer was
[3507.94 --> 3515.46]  It who knows schrodinger's video because unless we unless we actually make the video there's no way to check like it's okay
[3515.46 --> 3520.58]  It's not sure but the point is that it these videos don't really exist. I found some
[3521.06 --> 3523.54]  I found some weird I think it was best buy
[3523.94 --> 3530.34]  It's a retailer a us retailer that has a program where they just send product to like micro influencers
[3530.82 --> 3534.10]  Who make videos and then they get uploaded to their channel?
[3534.10 --> 3539.38]  And so I found some evga power supply there that had I think 80 000 views or something like that
[3539.38 --> 3541.86]  And I was like, okay evga is a pretty good brand. That's a pretty common model
[3541.86 --> 3543.22]  We could maybe say okay
[3543.22 --> 3547.86]  We'll average somewhere in the neighborhood of like 30 to 50 000 views assuming you know sort of similar quality
[3547.86 --> 3549.62]  And I think we could match that even with a pretty
[3550.18 --> 3555.86]  Generic templatized video format, especially if we have all of this in this testing data all this information
[3555.86 --> 3558.98]  Okay, so based on that we have about a
[3561.14 --> 3566.82]  Hundred and twelve dollar budget, you know for each one of these videos so we need to make sure that this is
[3567.38 --> 3569.38]  extremely streamlined
[3570.26 --> 3573.62]  But it's just going to be no no bs, you know simple simple title
[3574.02 --> 3577.54]  You know maybe a quick observation about it and then just the product name
[3578.02 --> 3581.78]  Just realistically because we don't have time to do more than that simple basic thumbnail
[3582.26 --> 3585.78]  And i'm really excited because I think that this is something that
[3587.62 --> 3593.06]  Needs to exist and hasn't really existed for a long time because it's just not
[3593.86 --> 3600.82]  Viable anymore to make review videos about a power supply or a motherboard you can't get enough
[3600.82 --> 3607.54]  Hasn't been viable in a long time yeah, you can't get enough views on it to justify the production value that people expect
[3607.86 --> 3611.86]  From a tech video and so we're just going to we're going to come in
[3613.06 --> 3615.06]  very very low budget and
[3615.62 --> 3620.98]  And just try and try and hit a really really broad range of power supplies and what I really want to happen
[3620.98 --> 3624.34]  And what i'm really excited for is the diamonds in the rough
[3625.22 --> 3629.14]  I am expecting that as we go through and we test you know every
[3629.14 --> 3635.46]  60 dollar power supply there's going to be a lot that are trash and there's going to be a small handful that are
[3636.50 --> 3638.50]  surprisingly really good
[3639.06 --> 3641.78]  I'm and i'm i'm just i'm i'm stoked on that
[3642.66 --> 3647.38]  I uh i'm really looking forward to you know putting together like a you know
[3647.38 --> 3655.14]  400 dollar pc build guide where every single component is labs validated and friggin awesome and um
[3656.50 --> 3659.54]  Yeah, really really really excited. It's been a long
[3660.10 --> 3663.14]  Time coming. There's been a lot of stumbling blocks along the road
[3663.70 --> 3667.14]  Oh something that we should have an update for you guys on very soon is
[3667.78 --> 3673.54]  The labs is coming to the end of the internal audit of every video they ever contributed to
[3673.54 --> 3677.86]  And you know what if anything was wrong cool in it?
[3677.86 --> 3681.38]  So we're going to be able to talk to you guys about that hopefully within the next
[3682.02 --> 3689.30]  Couple of weeks as part of our follow through on the transparency that we committed to back in august. I believe it was
[3690.58 --> 3692.18]  Gonna be good stuff
[3692.26 --> 3695.38]  Any news on the labs website asks geekpowerzero
[3695.38 --> 3705.30]  I want to release it then do it okay coward i'll do it now do it okay
[3706.50 --> 3708.50]  Do it
[3708.50 --> 3712.10]  What is luke doing? He's releasing the labs website. There's no content on it
[3714.42 --> 3718.02]  Does it work yeah, I don't know it's worked for so long
[3718.02 --> 3724.18]  I don't know the comparison I did didn't seem to work the comparison you did with well
[3724.18 --> 3729.70]  There's no articles. There's no data. Yeah. Yeah, that's the problem. Yeah, there's nothing on it
[3730.10 --> 3732.10]  I'd like to make a complaint about your alpha
[3735.14 --> 3739.06]  What's the complaint? Luke's luke's going luke's the alpha right now. No, no, no fight me dan
[3739.06 --> 3742.34]  Look at this guy fight me dan. I'm just trying to piss off luke. Yeah, do it. It's working
[3742.34 --> 3746.82]  It's not working because you have you have nothing. You have nothing. There's no angry angry
[3753.38 --> 3755.38]  This is exciting oh my god
[3756.18 --> 3760.74]  I mean are is this happening are we doing this? I think we're doing this. Yeah, i'm calling your bluff
[3760.74 --> 3763.06]  I think this is happening. I think we're doing this. Yeah, I'm not
[3763.14 --> 3766.50]  I mean you thought you didn't think I was bluffing. Did you know which is why i'm doing it?
[3766.82 --> 3769.30]  All right, i'm just i'm playing with the audience man. Come on
[3769.30 --> 3772.02]  Playing with my heart. He's just too good of an actor
[3774.42 --> 3775.54]  I'm not mad you're mad
[3779.78 --> 3780.58]  What is the url?
[3782.58 --> 3787.78]  I'll figure it out in a sec. Oh, okay. So we like don't have one yet. Apparently we do have yeah, just gotta buy one
[3787.78 --> 3789.70]  minus lab tips.com llt
[3791.70 --> 3797.54]  That's gonna direct to it now. So someone's gonna get that. No, there's there's no way llt is not doing that
[3799.78 --> 3804.10]  Oh, wow llt uh goes to telepathy. What what is this?
[3804.90 --> 3811.22]  Provided compelling memorable identities to companies across the globe really uh, okay
[3816.02 --> 3820.18]  Hold on a second. Uh-oh compelling memorable identities
[3821.38 --> 3823.38]  like
[3823.38 --> 3825.38]  these things
[3825.38 --> 3829.38]  What
[3829.38 --> 3834.42]  Uh, these guys work they just make brands they do brands. Yeah, they do branding
[3836.18 --> 3841.30]  Um, i'm just trying to think of which of these I have ever remembered
[3841.30 --> 3847.14]  Man when you when you look at some of these like
[3848.42 --> 3850.42]  I should get into
[3850.90 --> 3854.90]  Brand design stuff. I could write I could write fully in white on a pink. Okay
[3854.90 --> 3857.22]  It's harder than you think though. I know it is
[3857.30 --> 3862.26]  It is legitimately harder than you think like if you look at the packages that sarah puts together for when we do branding
[3862.26 --> 3864.98]  Like it's got to look good on a white background and a black background
[3864.98 --> 3869.62]  You got to account for when it's square and what's your word mark and you know, it's it's it's a thing
[3869.62 --> 3872.66]  It's a thing. I just don't know how I don't just don't know how memorable these things are
[3873.78 --> 3876.98]  Oh, wait parallels parallels is in here. Okay, that's something
[3877.94 --> 3881.70]  I didn't remember their branding or see it there, but that's something
[3884.34 --> 3889.30]  Okay, so um, how long how long does it take to launch a website like what's what's your problem a little bit?
[3889.30 --> 3893.46]  We're on it though. What you're slow or is it because the server is slow?
[3893.78 --> 3898.50]  Yes, your keyboard. Yeah, we need more money for faster servers for fast. Yeah for sure
[3902.10 --> 3904.10]  Yeah, you and everyone more money
[3907.78 --> 3909.78]  It's always something all right, uh
[3910.42 --> 3916.50]  Why don't we do one more merch message Dan go ahead and hit me. Oh, yeah. Oh nice. I got information from aj and yeah, everyone's lying
[3916.50 --> 3920.58]  Oh, about the browser thing. Yeah, okay here
[3922.66 --> 3927.62]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, so um, so other
[3928.82 --> 3930.02]  back is facebook
[3931.22 --> 3932.66]  yandex
[3932.66 --> 3935.62]  chrome derivative, okay, those there's your bottom three
[3936.42 --> 3937.94]  um
[3937.94 --> 3939.70]  then you got silk
[3939.70 --> 3941.46]  opera mobile
[3941.46 --> 3943.38]  chrome mobile web view
[3943.38 --> 3945.46]  samsung internet and
[3945.46 --> 3947.54]  Opera everything I just said is
[3948.10 --> 3950.10]  Is about half of unknown?
[3950.74 --> 3952.74]  Which is a little less than edge?
[3952.74 --> 3954.74]  Which is about the same as safari?
[3954.82 --> 3958.34]  Which is about on par with mobile safari? So so safari in here?
[3958.98 --> 3959.86]  uh actually
[3961.06 --> 3964.34]  Outpacing chrome mobile people watching mac address
[3965.62 --> 3968.66]  uh and in total firefox holds
[3970.66 --> 3972.66]  Somewhere in the neighborhood of about
[3973.62 --> 3974.98]  15 percent share
[3975.86 --> 3978.66]  Which has improved it used to be lower
[3979.30 --> 3983.54]  Yeah, but you guys it genuinely used to be lower. I think it's loud minority
[3983.54 --> 3989.46]  It's not 70 percent. Yeah, it's not it's not I think we were seeing some loud minority nonsense there
[3990.82 --> 3995.22]  Sorry guys, but we're calling you we're calling you on it
[3996.74 --> 3997.62]  Oh, what is this?
[3997.62 --> 4002.02]  Okay, cool
[4002.02 --> 4004.02]  Okay, cool. That's all good
[4005.86 --> 4006.18]  Yeah
[4008.18 --> 4008.58]  All right
[4010.26 --> 4011.06]  Well, good try
[4011.62 --> 4012.34]  good try y'all
[4012.34 --> 4013.94]  uh, okay dan hit me
[4013.94 --> 4015.14]  uh, sure
[4015.14 --> 4020.42]  uh, have you considered making more apple leather products like a maybe a desk pad?
[4021.22 --> 4024.90]  uh, ooh, that wouldn't be very good for a desk pad
[4025.46 --> 4026.50]  It's pretty soft, isn't it?
[4026.50 --> 4030.34]  Uh, it's not about the softness. It's about their like reflectiveness
[4030.34 --> 4031.14]  Mm-hmm
[4031.14 --> 4032.82]  You you don't you want you yeah, you
[4033.38 --> 4034.18]  uh, no
[4034.18 --> 4036.42]  No, we haven't
[4036.42 --> 4038.42]  It's go ahead. Sorry. I thought you're done
[4038.42 --> 4039.38]  Uh,
[4039.38 --> 4039.62]  Uh,
[4039.62 --> 4041.94]  Sifrin and flow playing chat said firefox is pretty good though
[4042.26 --> 4046.26]  Uh, and some other stuff. Why wouldn't people use it? Yeah, I want people to use it
[4046.26 --> 4048.90]  I want that number to go up, um, and it has gone up a little bit
[4048.90 --> 4051.30]  It used to be lower. I promise you it used to be lower
[4051.30 --> 4053.14]  I'm not saying it's bad to use firefox
[4053.14 --> 4057.14]  He's just saying that people were not 100% honest about their use of firefox or
[4057.70 --> 4062.98]  Firefox users were overrepresented in the poll because they were more incentivized to vote either
[4062.98 --> 4067.62]  They they were the ones that wanted to vote or for some reason the live audience is a higher percentage of
[4068.18 --> 4070.82]  Firefox users like there's a lot of things that could go into it
[4070.82 --> 4077.54]  I do think you have to be a particular brand of tech enthusiasts to sit and watch a four-hour tech podcast live
[4078.66 --> 4082.02]  Yeah, so maybe that group of people has a higher firefox buy-in
[4082.34 --> 4087.62]  and then of that group of people the firefox users were more incentivized to vote at the same time
[4087.94 --> 4092.66]  And that resulted in this really high number. So it might it might not be lying. Luke hates burgers
[4094.34 --> 4097.54]  But it's definitely hot dogs drastically misrepresentative
[4098.34 --> 4107.06]  Firefox had 0.3 percent in the uh, the hub 2023 review chrome had 52.1 safari had 40.6
[4107.22 --> 4113.22]  So like yeah, it's getting better though, which is good and I encourage you to still use it and
[4113.86 --> 4116.18]  If it's working for you, I encourage you to try it
[4117.46 --> 4120.10]  For me, I run into too many websites. It's just like don't work
[4120.10 --> 4122.82]  Yeah, it's just like you're not made for it
[4122.82 --> 4124.82]  Yeah, it's frustrating
[4124.82 --> 4126.82]  So it is what it is
[4128.58 --> 4129.54]  All right, Dan one more
[4129.54 --> 4134.90]  By the way, it does seem like the site is actually going to be coming online
[4135.70 --> 4136.26]  Really?
[4136.26 --> 4142.18]  It's taking a little bit because I had to get aj involved because of cname things and all this other stuff, but it's it's coming
[4142.18 --> 4142.90]  Mm-hmm
[4142.90 --> 4143.62]  Yeah
[4143.62 --> 4147.94]  Linus some time ago you mentioned having issues with your optical tb3 cables
[4148.58 --> 4152.98]  Would you still recommend optical tb3 or use separate usb and display cables?
[4152.98 --> 4154.66]  Um
[4154.66 --> 4159.22]  I
[4159.22 --> 4163.78]  Thunderbolt is amazing when it works
[4164.74 --> 4168.74]  On a board where thunderbolt works all the time. I would recommend it
[4169.30 --> 4174.18]  But finding a board on the pc side of things where thunderbolt works consistently
[4175.38 --> 4176.10]  It's tough
[4176.10 --> 4181.78]  Um, and I know that uh, wow, what's her name? caldigit? I think it was
[4182.42 --> 4185.14]  Uh, I don't want to say this and then be wrong
[4186.02 --> 4187.14]  Uh optical
[4188.58 --> 4190.34]  I think caldigit
[4192.74 --> 4198.98]  Had talked about potential problems with optical thunderbolt cables
[4199.94 --> 4203.22]  Um, though I can't find a source for this so
[4203.22 --> 4206.26]  Oh, oh, no, don't quote me on it. Um
[4207.14 --> 4211.54]  But yeah, I have definitely not found it to be a perfect experience
[4212.50 --> 4215.70]  But I have found that at times it's been
[4216.58 --> 4220.90]  It's been perfect with particular board and dock combos
[4221.38 --> 4225.94]  Yeah, I can't find a source for that caldigit thing. So so ignore it. Um
[4228.66 --> 4229.30]  I wish I could
[4229.30 --> 4231.30]  I
[4234.58 --> 4240.82]  Yeah, no, no, I that I I don't it doesn't look like that was caldigit someone at some point told me that they had
[4241.22 --> 4242.82]  encountered some issues with
[4243.54 --> 4248.10]  uh, with optical thunderbolt cables and docks and or something but I
[4249.46 --> 4251.46]  The problem is the cost the other way
[4252.26 --> 4255.70]  Right like a thunderbolt dock and optical thunderbolt cable is expensive
[4255.70 --> 4258.98]  But getting multiple optical cables and
[4258.98 --> 4262.98]  Multiple docks is also really expensive
[4262.98 --> 4266.10]  So there's there's no good solution unfortunately
[4269.30 --> 4271.94]  If you don't need high-speed usb it's actually pretty easy
[4271.94 --> 4276.98]  Then all you need is an optical htmi or displayport cable which have come down a ton in price
[4276.98 --> 4279.14]  They're reasonably affordable ish
[4279.70 --> 4284.26]  They cost about as much as you know a premium cable would have, you know five ten years ago
[4284.90 --> 4288.66]  And then all you need is one of those cheap extensions like we covered recently
[4289.54 --> 4293.62]  But if you need a high-speed usb at distance, it's tough
[4294.50 --> 4296.50]  really tough
[4296.50 --> 4304.82]  Um, also they said they had an issue with the code the backpack code, but are you forwarding that elsewhere?
[4305.54 --> 4310.10]  Uh, they didn't leave their email for me to forward it. So, uh, please reach out to support if you're having any issues
[4310.50 --> 4313.78]  Ah, yes, okay. All right. Let's do another topic
[4314.90 --> 4318.18]  Luke, what do you want to talk about you want to talk about the land center tour?
[4318.50 --> 4320.82]  Yeah, so I didn't get to do this, but uh,
[4320.82 --> 4326.90]  Uh, dan says that he's pretty happy and it seems like all the planning that we've done is gonna be okay
[4326.90 --> 4329.54]  So that's a that's good for me to hear all right happy about that
[4329.54 --> 4333.70]  Well, the video is gonna have me talking about everything that I think is cool
[4334.18 --> 4340.18]  So instead of doing that here, I would like to hear dan's thoughts cool on the land center on the land center
[4340.18 --> 4343.14]  Yeah, this was your this was your first time seeing it in person
[4343.14 --> 4346.98]  You've only ever seen it on a piece of paper or on a computer screen before that's right
[4346.98 --> 4350.66]  Yeah, how how did how did reality compare to expectations here?
[4350.82 --> 4355.62]  Uh, the ceilings are a hell of a lot higher and it just feels like a larger space
[4355.86 --> 4361.38]  I did a walkthrough and a measurement in the uh, the lab area because I wanted to get a sense of scale
[4361.86 --> 4365.30]  Um, and I didn't quite realize that it was longer than the lab
[4366.10 --> 4371.06]  Uh, which kind of was disturbing for uh, doing audio and speakers
[4371.54 --> 4374.90]  Uh, absolutely insanely giant building and then there's two of them
[4375.62 --> 4378.98]  Yeah, next to each other. Yeah, it's gonna be everything is just kind of bigger
[4378.98 --> 4386.58]  Um, yeah, it was it was really kind of inspiring I guess to see this empty building that
[4386.58 --> 4390.02]  I know what it's gonna kind of look like at the end of it and also had a part in
[4390.58 --> 4393.54]  Stuffing things into the concrete, you know, it's really cool
[4394.02 --> 4399.54]  Um, but it does increase the amount of stress because I go like, ah, yeah, we'll do we'll do 200 feet here
[4399.54 --> 4403.22]  And we'll put that one there and you know, I'll grab my tape measure out and kind of get a feel for it
[4403.22 --> 4408.58]  And then it gets uh, everything gets a little real when it's yeah, actually right. I better I hope I did my math, right?
[4409.14 --> 4413.70]  Yeah, very much so you're real real confident then you you look at it physically and you're like, oh
[4413.78 --> 4418.50]  Yeah, because I heard the echo and I uh, yeah, linus you're gonna treat this right and it's like, yeah
[4418.90 --> 4422.10]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all the other buildings, right? Yes, and then I felt a lot better
[4422.18 --> 4428.18]  So I think I think the coverage should be good for for the audio stuff these big warehouse boxes just need it
[4428.18 --> 4432.50]  Like oh, yeah, it's crazy. It's worth it. It's absolutely worth it. Yeah, 100%
[4433.14 --> 4438.90]  It's expensive, but it makes a big difference to just the livability of the space
[4439.46 --> 4442.90]  Like I I hate that just echo echo echo echo like uh
[4443.62 --> 4447.78]  And like those the standing waves that you get in these in these giant boxes
[4448.02 --> 4452.90]  It's you can't even some some of the like gyms that um that I play at
[4453.22 --> 4456.90]  You can't have a conversation with someone on the other side of the court. Yeah
[4456.90 --> 4460.26]  Because there's just too much interference frustrating
[4461.30 --> 4465.22]  Yeah, it's like it sucks like you could yell like, you know, uh, oh, you know
[4465.22 --> 4470.26]  Like you can yell one word and people but if you try to actually just like talk to someone even while you're just like warming up or whatever
[4470.26 --> 4475.78]  It's yeah, it's pretty frustrating. So obviously it's going to be a badminton center as well, but um
[4477.38 --> 4482.26]  Land events man chase kind of laid out for us what the floor plan is going to be
[4482.26 --> 4486.26]  So we're looking at 250 to 300 seats. We're gonna have a stage
[4486.82 --> 4490.34]  We're gonna have like a retro corner which is going to be set up with a bunch of
[4490.82 --> 4495.62]  Consoles and stuff like that i'm kind of thinking I don't really need the projector in my theater room anymore
[4496.10 --> 4497.06]  so hey
[4497.62 --> 4498.26]  um
[4498.26 --> 4503.22]  Maybe we take a ball in 4k 120 hertz projector and put it in there for
[4503.94 --> 4510.10]  Obviously not retro games maybe maybe more modern games on that consoles that support that kind of resolution and refresh rate
[4510.10 --> 4516.66]  Um, we're gonna have it light controlled so it will be it will be dark like the projector is gonna look freaking awesome
[4516.66 --> 4519.06]  It's an epson ls 12 000. So whoo
[4519.70 --> 4527.06]  I was saying to chase. Um, I used to have a crt projector from an old university one of the with the the blue green and red tubes
[4527.06 --> 4534.42]  Yeah, yeah get some of those, you know 12 foot smash at crt latencies. I mean, uh beauty contest at crt latencies
[4534.98 --> 4536.98]  Uh would be pretty sweet
[4536.98 --> 4537.62]  Okay
[4537.62 --> 4538.98]  We
[4538.98 --> 4546.58]  How's that going? I haven't personally seen an update about that. I have okay gotten an update where we're waiting on legal advice
[4546.58 --> 4552.58]  Oh, okay. That's the same one. We definitely cannot run a smash tournament without worrying about nintendo going after us
[4552.58 --> 4556.34]  Yeah, however, we are still exploring the possibility of running a beauty pageant
[4556.90 --> 4561.78]  Yeah, I was not talking in the contents of the beauty pageant. I just meant, you know, people might want to play it there
[4561.78 --> 4562.42]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[4562.42 --> 4564.02]  I'm really excited about the beauty pageant
[4564.02 --> 4568.98]  Me too. I I think that gamer beauty is something that is underappreciated in this world
[4568.98 --> 4569.46]  Yeah, yeah
[4569.46 --> 4575.38]  For for those of you who lack context nintendo has a bunch of rules about community smash bros
[4575.38 --> 4576.74]  uh tournaments
[4576.74 --> 4584.10]  We think they're stupid. Um, so our plan is to hold a beauty pageant where
[4584.98 --> 4585.38]  um
[4585.94 --> 4586.34]  people
[4586.34 --> 4592.10]  uh, two people, uh, you know go and they they sit on a couch or on chairs
[4592.10 --> 4597.78]  Relatively close to each other so that judges would be able to assess their beauty. Yeah, um, and they
[4597.78 --> 4604.26]  While they wait for judging. Yeah, um, they could play video games. We're gonna have there are various activities
[4604.58 --> 4609.38]  Yeah, that they could participate in to do a particular one. That's up to them. Yep
[4609.78 --> 4612.34]  And then uh at some point, um,
[4612.90 --> 4618.34]  You know, maybe when they're maybe when they're bored and they're finished, you know playing games or whatever they decide to do
[4618.42 --> 4622.58]  Participating in whatever activities they like. Yeah, then the judges will declare
[4622.58 --> 4629.14]  Uh one to be more beautiful than the other. Yeah, and they will advance to the next round. Yes
[4629.70 --> 4636.34]  Um of of beauty competition. Yeah, this yeah, this pageant is more of like a one versus one
[4637.30 --> 4642.90]  Scenario with a with a ladder system. Yeah instead of um, is there a destination involved?
[4643.70 --> 4644.50]  uh trophy
[4645.46 --> 4652.10]  A destination like a final destination final destination beauty trophy. Yeah, yeah, beauty trophy would be nice. We can print those
[4652.58 --> 4658.98]  I mean, sorry, it should be fine. Like if it's a beauty pageant
[4658.98 --> 4665.22]  I don't really see how anyone can get mad at us. Yeah, I mean those are legal. Yeah, right. I think so. Yeah, you're allowed to supply
[4666.02 --> 4668.74]  Various forms of entertainment. Yeah, or they could bring their own entertainment
[4669.46 --> 4674.26]  Then it's like not our liability if what like are we gonna get in trouble for having a power outlet?
[4674.26 --> 4680.74]  So we provide a couch a tv and a power outlet. Yeah, everything that happens after that point. It's not really our problem
[4680.74 --> 4684.50]  Yeah, I don't know
[4684.50 --> 4690.66]  Um, anyway, so yeah, like console gaming corner, uh chase wants to get a bunch of like arcade machines and stuff like that
[4690.66 --> 4696.34]  Do like an arcade wall. The idea is that I don't want people just stuck at their chairs
[4697.30 --> 4701.86]  For 24 or 36 or 48 hours or however long these events end up being
[4702.66 --> 4708.34]  One thing that I was that I did not expect is that chase said the plan is to do setup in one day
[4708.34 --> 4712.50]  Um, I think I had set the goal of setup in like three or four hours
[4712.50 --> 4715.94]  So i'm gonna have to get aligned with him on that for the land. Yeah
[4717.22 --> 4721.62]  I mean if we can have it organized enough we should be able to just add more bodies
[4721.86 --> 4727.22]  Tables and networking and stuff like that should all be three four hours. Yeah, what's the one day?
[4727.70 --> 4732.10]  Well, is it the arcade machines arcade machines console corner, but that stuff is
[4732.82 --> 4735.94]  I mean you could be setting that stuff up while people are
[4735.94 --> 4740.10]  Landing and setting up their own computer. That's true. But then the organizers don't get to game
[4740.66 --> 4744.02]  They're like busy moving arcade machines around so we'll figure it out
[4744.02 --> 4747.46]  But I mean maybe that's something that we can solve with just like volunteers
[4748.02 --> 4753.30]  Yeah, because the original spec was just getting the tables and networking and power deployed
[4753.54 --> 4758.90]  Yeah, four hours. Well, so you're adding things chase has some really cool. I chase added them
[4758.90 --> 4763.94]  Yeah, it's all right. All right. All right. All right. Chase has some great ideas for um
[4764.50 --> 4765.94]  a lot of
[4765.94 --> 4767.94]  Some like game jam type stuff
[4768.50 --> 4773.06]  Community and engagement with maybe maps or games or things like that which seems pretty cool
[4774.02 --> 4776.02]  Just keeping all the events going and moving
[4776.82 --> 4780.10]  I don't know. I should be it should be a hell of a lot of fun. We found out that the server
[4780.74 --> 4786.74]  Room is way too small. I measured it with sean today. It's five foot wide, which isn't too bad
[4787.54 --> 4794.02]  Yeah, it's about the same width as the one under the stairs here. It's it's a little wider than the one is it? Okay, not much
[4794.66 --> 4796.98]  It's not much, but it'll be okay. It's serviceable
[4796.98 --> 4803.78]  So you're gonna have to squeeze around to the back of the rack again. Well, it's rack width times two most likely. Oh, so it's not too bad
[4803.78 --> 4806.10]  That's not bad. I still think we should put a door in the office. Yeah
[4806.10 --> 4807.30]  I talked to Yvonne about that
[4807.30 --> 4812.42]  She's also going to see if there's the possibility of us just making the room a little bit bigger
[4813.14 --> 4818.66]  I I asked her I must point blank. I was just like I mean, we've gone through final inspections a lot of times
[4818.66 --> 4822.10]  Have you ever seen the inspector pull out a measuring tape and she's like no
[4822.74 --> 4827.78]  So with that in mind, maybe the room is just six inches wider and nobody notices
[4829.86 --> 4834.66]  So we'll see if that's a possibility it may not be we may be stuck with what we have in which case
[4835.14 --> 4839.54]  Having the access door. So the shape of the room is like this and there's a door here
[4839.54 --> 4844.26]  So getting around the rack and getting equipment to the back like a ups could be tough
[4844.26 --> 4848.82]  So Dan had proposed putting a door on the side so you can actually get in from the back
[4848.82 --> 4855.06]  And if that door open this way, then that that could be quite helpful for getting around the back of the rack and as long as we're super organized
[4855.86 --> 4857.46]  first time around
[4857.46 --> 4863.70]  Getting all the power and networking drops in there. Dan you estimated 300 drops. Are you sure? No
[4863.70 --> 4867.22]  No, probably though. Where'd you pull that number from earlier today?
[4868.42 --> 4874.66]  So some of the sample articles that have been submitted to the site have stuff like that uh on them
[4876.66 --> 4880.02]  That's hilarious. I say do it. Are you sure?
[4881.46 --> 4887.94]  I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean we've used chat GPT to come up with silly sample text for our nerdy website
[4887.94 --> 4889.94]  So it should be fine
[4895.62 --> 4897.70]  Sometimes chat GPT can be a little sassy
[4900.26 --> 4905.94]  It's your fault if it goes poorly i'm on vacation. I don't have to do my stop line. I remember what's the line?
[4905.94 --> 4908.34]  I'm not even supposed to be in today or whatever it is. Yeah
[4910.98 --> 4912.98]  Sorry, i'm looking for those runs as well
[4912.98 --> 4916.66]  I'm not even supposed to be here today there. That's that's the one
[4920.02 --> 4921.86]  Let's see how many runs is this
[4923.94 --> 4925.94]  How many speakers are there?
[4925.94 --> 4931.78]  Oh hilarious, so the person Luke's coordinating with to get this done is apparently supposed to be on vacation too
[4933.94 --> 4935.94]  Amazing
[4935.94 --> 4942.26]  And the other main person we're coordinating with it's like it's it's like probably their bedtime
[4942.50 --> 4948.26]  Let alone pass their hours. Linus I miscalculated. Yeah, it's 460. Are you kidding me?
[4948.26 --> 4954.10]  There's no way that's right. I don't think that's right. No, because that's power. That's power. I misclicked on one of them. Oh
[4955.46 --> 4960.18]  Oh, I scared myself. Well, we don't need we don't need to drop to every computer in the lan
[4960.18 --> 4966.82]  No, no, no, I miscalculated. I grabbed a wattage from a couple of the oh my god from one of them. It's 278
[4967.62 --> 4972.42]  Really? Sorry, it's 314. Wow. I was actually on the money 314 runs
[4973.70 --> 4977.46]  To what okay, I know you already said access control speakers
[4977.94 --> 4983.78]  APs cameras like that adds up. Yeah, how many freaking data ports do we have it can't be that many
[4983.78 --> 4989.22]  So it's probably not I believe that this is only
[4990.50 --> 4994.18]  Um, no, hold on jeez. I don't know if these are all right
[4995.54 --> 4998.26]  Yeah, there's a hundred and four devices
[4999.86 --> 5004.42]  A hundred and four devices total. Okay, so there's like 22
[5005.22 --> 5008.10]  Door access you've got 32 speakers
[5008.10 --> 5009.86]  It's probably gonna be 14 ap's
[5009.86 --> 5014.90]  I think it's probably like a couple hundred there's 36 cameras. I guess we'll find out and then
[5015.54 --> 5021.14]  I'm not entirely sure how many other ports we have. No, there's a bunch more cameras too because every court
[5021.70 --> 5023.94]  has an ethernet drop for
[5024.66 --> 5030.34]  Man, every court's got like three ethernet drops or something stupid like that. Okay. Well no, I calculated those in too
[5030.66 --> 5034.26]  Unless there's another one in here for courts. I haven't looked at this in a while
[5035.14 --> 5039.30]  Man these cool. Hey, hey those sony cameras that you wanted for the
[5039.30 --> 5044.58]  Inside of the cnc or whatever that was wanted and the way and show yeah, that's that's not happening. Yeah
[5044.58 --> 5051.30]  I didn't think so. Okay, I wanted a usb webcam to be perfectly honest. Yeah, but those sony's look great for court cams
[5051.30 --> 5056.58]  What was the model of that again? Uh, let me check for you. Uh, but yeah, those looked absolutely perfect
[5057.06 --> 5061.22]  Um, and they have a bunch of interesting features which make them really good for that as well
[5061.54 --> 5064.34]  I believe like a direct ingest or something like that
[5064.90 --> 5073.62]  Yeah, they can up my uh, they can just stream. Yeah, uh, is it the ilme fr7? No, that's what I wanted to put on the wan show here
[5074.90 --> 5076.34]  For fun
[5076.34 --> 5079.86]  For fun. We already have c100s
[5080.58 --> 5084.66]  Those are good cameras. They are fine. Yeah, I guess so. Uh
[5086.18 --> 5089.62]  I only have three of them. It's the ilx
[5090.34 --> 5092.34]  lr1
[5094.34 --> 5098.82]  So, all right, okay, here it is these look super cool
[5100.02 --> 5102.18]  They'll do up to 120 hertz
[5103.06 --> 5104.26]  um 4k
[5105.46 --> 5110.50]  They have uh an ethernet output. They're designed for drones, so they're super compact
[5111.14 --> 5116.42]  Uh, they're sony, so like wow anywhere from 100 iso to 32 000
[5116.42 --> 5123.78]  Uh, so i'm assuming pretty good low light. Um, they just get wired up with like dc power in
[5124.42 --> 5124.82]  um
[5125.78 --> 5126.26]  Boom
[5126.26 --> 5132.34]  That's what it looks like. There's an ethernet jack on the side so you can just have it what I guess rtmp
[5134.98 --> 5140.18]  Right, dan, I I guess so I don't know I wasn't even considering these I wanted a webcam
[5140.90 --> 5144.98]  I mean, okay, that's fair. Well, who where did these come from then? Well, I mean
[5146.10 --> 5148.10]  sony
[5148.10 --> 5150.10]  Wifi compatible
[5150.18 --> 5153.22]  Wireless let what does yes times seven mean?
[5153.94 --> 5158.90]  Is it wi-fi seven? Is that what they're trying to say? Because that would be cool wi-fi sevens crazy
[5159.86 --> 5161.14]  cool
[5161.14 --> 5163.30]  2.4 gigahertz times sevens probably antennas
[5164.50 --> 5166.74]  No, there's no way that's seven antennas
[5168.82 --> 5176.98]  I would be very surprised a compact device like this it's specific. Oh, no, no, there's two brackets there. Never mind. Yeah, I have no idea
[5176.98 --> 5182.50]  Oh, this is this looks like gibberish. Look at this. What a mess. No, because it's it's just closing two different
[5183.46 --> 5190.18]  Oh, someone's saying it's note seven notes. Yeah, it's a footnote. Oh, that makes sense. Good job. Thank you
[5190.18 --> 5194.90]  Well, that's a really bad way of doing uh land terminal usb land. Oh, no, this one's usb
[5195.14 --> 5196.82]  There's there's 11 land antennas
[5197.38 --> 5199.14]  Yeah, yeah, yeah 100%
[5199.14 --> 5201.70]  That's funny. I thought I saw uh, man
[5202.42 --> 5206.82]  I thought I saw a an rj45 jack on the side of it
[5207.38 --> 5209.06]  The last time I was looking at it anyway
[5209.06 --> 5214.50]  Panasonic has another one that's kind of similar, but I think the cost is quite a bit higher. So yeah, I think the panasonic ones are about
[5214.50 --> 5218.58]  6,000. Yeah, uh, if I look at my thing here. Yeah showcase cams
[5218.58 --> 5221.86]  So the lumix bs1h was the one you were looking at
[5222.82 --> 5228.10]  Um, yeah, these are half the price like what I have to get a little actually the lumix ones are 35
[5228.50 --> 5231.86]  So, oh, I was wrong. You just needed two of them for 7 000
[5232.50 --> 5238.42]  Okay, all right. Well, maybe we'll have to like rent one of each and maybe play around with them a little bit see which ones
[5239.14 --> 5241.14]  um
[5241.14 --> 5248.02]  Are really easy to use for network network recording essentially because that's all I really care about
[5248.82 --> 5251.30]  video io yeah, this one does not have
[5252.26 --> 5255.70]  Uh, rj45 built in whereas the panasonic one. What's it called?
[5256.50 --> 5265.06]  Um, do do do that is the lumix bs1h not panasonic. That's the one. Oh, it is. Yeah, sorry. Yeah
[5265.06 --> 5271.38]  Yeah, this thing's pretty cool too. Also very compact. Oh, wait, this one's cheaper. Oh, it's on sale. It's a oh
[5272.18 --> 5274.58]  Offer ends december 3rd. Are we doing this?
[5275.94 --> 5277.94]  Am I doing this?
[5277.94 --> 5280.34]  Uh, it's a thousand dollars off. Uh,
[5281.14 --> 5284.90]  Holy sh** um, you can always just sell them. Oh, oh f**k
[5285.54 --> 5287.94]  Hold on. We got a contact linus to approve this
[5287.94 --> 5288.82]  Who?
[5288.82 --> 5289.94]  When do you?
[5289.94 --> 5294.58]  You know, when does the deal end? December 31st monday we've got oh
[5296.10 --> 5297.06]  Yeah
[5297.06 --> 5302.34]  That's what i'm talking about. Do you have your credit card? Well, yeah, do you want me to ask colton? What?
[5303.22 --> 5307.46]  Colton what does colton have to do with any of this? Here's a credit card. Um
[5308.82 --> 5311.54]  What no, I have a credit card dan
[5312.90 --> 5317.78]  Jeez, you never know. Yvonne might have taken your privileges away. Okay. I is this one for
[5317.78 --> 5321.30]  4k. I don't know fhd
[5324.98 --> 5325.38]  Yes
[5326.26 --> 5334.50]  Up to 4k. I don't think it does a 120 fps 4k. No, it does 60 fps 4k, but it'll do up to 180 fps hd
[5334.50 --> 5341.14]  Which is fine and actually probably better for sports. What's the maximum frame rate supported by twitch? Just 60, right?
[5341.86 --> 5346.42]  I believe so. Yes, I think so. Yeah, because I was planning to just use twitch because like who cares
[5346.98 --> 5350.58]  But they have what it says like a pretty tight bit rate constraint if I remember
[5355.70 --> 5356.98]  Support streaming uhd
[5357.62 --> 5362.02]  supports genlock and time code when I can find right now it's it's 60 fps
[5362.58 --> 5366.90]  At 4k. Yeah. Yeah for twitch. Oh, sorry. Yes for twitch
[5366.90 --> 5371.54]  Wait, this one doesn't mention the ethernet jack either. Okay. I could have sworn
[5372.02 --> 5376.34]  This one had an ethernet jack though now just a gosh darn it. Yeah, it's right there
[5377.38 --> 5382.02]  Okay, hold on a second. Maybe the issue with the sony is not
[5382.90 --> 5386.90]  That it doesn't have it. Maybe the issue with the sony is just the way it's listed on the site
[5386.90 --> 5392.42]  Okay, sorry. Am I am I shopping right now? Like is this just a linus is shopping for cameras?
[5392.42 --> 5396.34]  I think this is interesting. So we're working because I mean I need to know this thing
[5397.54 --> 5400.10]  Where's the where's the side of this bloody thing?
[5400.66 --> 5404.58]  Show me the side sony. Yeah, okay. No, I thought it was on the side
[5405.06 --> 5408.82]  So I think I'm I was just completely mistaken about that
[5408.82 --> 5412.02]  I don't think the sony has ethernet built in I think you'd have to use a usb adapter
[5412.02 --> 5416.10]  Which in theory is fine. Oh my god micro hdmi
[5416.90 --> 5421.14]  If we ever did want to use optical hdmi or something like that, that's a nightmare
[5421.14 --> 5427.78]  That is just asking for failure that connector should not exist. Okay. What's this thing got got sdi? Oh, yeah
[5428.50 --> 5436.58]  Okay, yeah sdi full-sized hdmi. That's a real camera. Yeah, give me two. I'll take two. It's also a thousand dollars off right now
[5436.58 --> 5441.06]  Oh, god, uh, what's the recording monitor kit? I don't think I need that. No
[5442.42 --> 5446.10]  What's that? What is it? Oh, yeah? No, we don't need a monitor on it at all. Do we know?
[5446.82 --> 5449.70]  Okay, you're gonna you get up on a really tall ladder?
[5450.50 --> 5452.50]  Oh, no, is this sensor too big?
[5453.46 --> 5455.46]  Is it gonna cause like
[5455.46 --> 5461.70]  Too much too much um like depth of field like it's all be all in focus because is it micro four thirds because we have a
[5462.02 --> 5466.26]  I believe micro four thirds is like a multiple crop factor so frame oh
[5466.26 --> 5468.26]  Oh
[5468.82 --> 5472.50]  Oh, you got a nice fast lens. It's gonna be nice and bright footnote 11
[5473.22 --> 5475.46]  I don't know why but something someone's saying on the sony
[5475.46 --> 5479.62]  Uh, footnote 11 or the one that we were like, what's this star seven?
[5479.62 --> 5486.50]  And then we saw a star 11 as well look at footnote 11. I mean sure I guess if I remember correctly that had something to do with the land thing
[5486.50 --> 5486.90]  Mm
[5486.90 --> 5490.90]  Mm
[5490.90 --> 5495.94]  Uh, where were the footnotes those were on those were on sony's site for it, right?
[5495.94 --> 5497.38]  Most likely I think so
[5498.82 --> 5505.38]  What even is wanshow? I don't know. I have no idea anymore. I'm still looking for the run calculations
[5505.38 --> 5510.02]  I don't think I bothered because we have so many free ports because of just the poe requirement
[5510.02 --> 5516.26]  I can't even find i'm sorry guys. I can't find these footnotes very easily anymore
[5516.82 --> 5520.66]  Uh, yeah, uh, you might just have to post what it is
[5521.22 --> 5525.38]  Because I don't think I can I don't think I can find that right now. Let me see if I can have a
[5526.58 --> 5535.30]  Notes footnote 11 a commercially available usb to land conversion adapter is required. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yep. Yep. Yep. We figured that out
[5535.30 --> 5542.66]  Okay, uh, all right, I need to make a note to maybe buy some of these cameras. Okay, so tell me this dan
[5543.62 --> 5550.18]  At that price do we just go bs1h is on every court? I will do the calculation for you here
[5550.90 --> 5551.78]  uh
[5551.78 --> 5553.62]  at that price
[5553.62 --> 5554.82]  Yeah
[5554.82 --> 5559.38]  Because the other cameras that we were gonna get are the same price
[5559.38 --> 5566.42]  So do you want to know the damage if you want a 14 of these? Well, I guess it would only be uh 12 wouldn't it?
[5566.90 --> 5568.02]  No, no, be 14
[5568.82 --> 5576.26]  Ready? Mm-hmm. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Uh, it's 49 000. Oh, no, hold on
[5577.14 --> 5584.18]  That's the wrong price 35 000. Oh, okay. Well, that's much better. Wow. You really know how to make 35 000 sound like a lot less money
[5584.18 --> 5586.18]  Tell me 49 000 first
[5587.30 --> 5590.50]  Um, yeah, yeah, I should just go get the billy billy money
[5591.46 --> 5593.46]  That'll take care of it
[5597.06 --> 5598.26]  Go on do it. Um
[5599.78 --> 5604.98]  Man, these things look kind of awesome. I really I really wish
[5605.94 --> 5608.74]  That I had one to try first
[5610.18 --> 5611.62]  What's their return policy?
[5611.62 --> 5614.74]  Hey, pnh wanna
[5616.50 --> 5620.98]  Wanna just you know, i'll just buy them all and then if they don't work i'll just return them all and
[5621.46 --> 5623.06]  pay the restocking fee on one
[5623.70 --> 5625.46]  Do you think they'd have 14 in stock?
[5626.42 --> 5630.66]  It shouldn't matter it shouldn't matter if it's if they're running a promo they should be able to
[5631.38 --> 5633.38]  Oh, this is interesting. Apparently
[5634.10 --> 5635.14]  14 is like
[5636.10 --> 5637.62]  not a thing how do I
[5638.74 --> 5640.26]  Oh, oh you can just key it in
[5641.62 --> 5643.62]  Okay
[5643.62 --> 5645.62]  Let's see
[5645.86 --> 5647.86]  Um
[5650.10 --> 5650.58]  Buuh
[5651.78 --> 5654.42]  Instant savings of fourteen thousand dollars though
[5654.42 --> 5658.82]  Okay, I might I might need to call
[5660.26 --> 5665.46]  Like andy or someone and say hey, do we have a full frame camera and a lens that I can just grab
[5666.18 --> 5668.02]  Take home this weekend
[5668.58 --> 5674.74]  Like put in position get some test footage and basically see if it's too soft at the extreme ends of the court
[5675.30 --> 5676.26]  Mm
[5676.26 --> 5678.26]  All right, we'll figure it out
[5678.50 --> 5679.46]  Oh
[5679.46 --> 5681.62]  All right. Anyway, uh, what are we supposed to be talking about?
[5682.42 --> 5688.42]  We're still talking about our badminton center land center land center. Oh, sorry. Yeah, and badminton center. It's gonna be both
[5688.42 --> 5690.42]  Uh, okay, okay, let's let's let's move on
[5690.42 --> 5692.42]  Let's move on new gm infotainment
[5692.98 --> 5694.66]  operating system leaves
[5695.30 --> 5696.18]  Drivers
[5696.18 --> 5699.62]  Stranded who could have seen this coming gm has issued a
[5700.34 --> 5705.54]  Brief pause on deliveries of the new chevy blazer ev in order to address
[5706.18 --> 5708.18]  software quality issues
[5708.50 --> 5716.58]  The blazer was gm's first model to drop support for android auto and apple carplay in favor of android automotive os
[5717.30 --> 5720.74]  A custom version of android designed specifically for cars
[5721.14 --> 5723.86]  So this is meant to run on the car
[5724.42 --> 5730.42]  Rather than on your phone with the car as effectively a display and input for it
[5730.90 --> 5736.26]  The cars launch has reportedly been plagued with infotainment bugs that have left drivers stranded including
[5736.58 --> 5743.22]  inside evs writer kevin williams whose vehicle infotainment system went blank while he was driving
[5743.86 --> 5748.82]  failed to charge then produced a service vehicle soon error message
[5749.62 --> 5753.86]  gm claimed that the issue only affected a limited number of customers but
[5753.86 --> 5762.58]  But posts about serious issues appear to be fairly widespread including one poster whose car repeatedly refused to shift into park
[5762.90 --> 5768.74]  And another whose car heating couldn't be turned off and whose infotainment system bricked and had to be fully replaced
[5769.86 --> 5773.06]  gm recently claimed and later retracted
[5773.70 --> 5778.50]  That it dropped android auto and carplay for the sake of user safety
[5778.50 --> 5782.18]  I added that one one word in there myself you can decide which one it was
[5782.66 --> 5789.14]  Because the apps are buggy and sometimes force drivers to take their attention off the road. Oh, well, this is much better
[5789.94 --> 5792.98]  Why is gm so determined to suck?
[5795.30 --> 5801.78]  I can't figure it out. They heard the term embrace the suck and just took it in a direction. It's not supposed to go. I can't figure it out
[5802.74 --> 5810.58]  This is coming from someone who actually kind of fanboys over the one gm vehicle that they have ever owned
[5811.30 --> 5813.62]  The volt is a great car
[5814.82 --> 5816.26]  And then they discontinued it
[5817.06 --> 5821.70]  Like just in time for it to have been super awesome and competitive
[5822.34 --> 5823.14]  um
[5823.14 --> 5827.62]  And then they're they're taking one of the best things about it, which is that I had
[5828.34 --> 5829.70]  an older
[5829.70 --> 5831.22]  Car that felt
[5832.10 --> 5836.10]  Every bit as modern as any other car because it just used freaking android auto
[5836.26 --> 5838.10]  And so it was always getting software updates
[5838.74 --> 5843.30]  And I didn't have to rely on my stupid car manufacturer to be good at software because let's face it
[5843.70 --> 5848.26]  They all suck at software with some exceptions
[5848.26 --> 5852.98]  I mean you can make arguments about tesla having some pretty good elements to their software
[5853.46 --> 5855.86]  um
[5855.86 --> 5857.86]  Trying to think of anyone else
[5858.18 --> 5858.42]  No
[5859.30 --> 5864.02]  The last thing I want is to touch any software made by my car manufacturer
[5864.50 --> 5867.38]  I want to use software that is made by whoever I chose
[5867.38 --> 5871.78]  To put in my pocket where it's already logged into all of my crap all the time
[5871.78 --> 5875.22]  And everything works and is set up pretty much the way that I'd expect it to
[5875.22 --> 5877.86]  And then when I change my car or get in someone else's car
[5878.02 --> 5880.34]  I just plug in I rent a car boom
[5880.34 --> 5884.42]  I'm ready to go I'm off to the races that is a great user experience and anything else
[5884.42 --> 5886.90]  Is a giant boatload of suck and
[5887.54 --> 5887.78]  I'm
[5887.78 --> 5890.34]  I don't even take any pleasure in being right about this
[5890.34 --> 5892.34]  But it was so obvious
[5892.34 --> 5898.26]  That this was going to be a giant pile of garbage and a disadvantage for gm's buyers
[5898.74 --> 5903.46]  That I just I can't fathom it like obviously i'm not saying well
[5903.46 --> 5906.02]  I should be ceo of gm i'm not sitting here
[5906.82 --> 5910.50]  In front of my tv talking about how much better of a coach for the patriots
[5910.50 --> 5915.14]  I could be or whatever right like that's not the point it's just I don't know
[5915.14 --> 5918.42]  I'm sure there's engineers at gm who would have known better
[5918.42 --> 5923.38]  Maybe just talk to the people internally that's leadership right you just talk to people
[5923.38 --> 5927.54]  Someone could have told you that this is probably a bad idea and i'm sure there's
[5927.54 --> 5930.58]  There's business monster reasons for doing it, but I don't care
[5931.22 --> 5935.94]  There's business monster reasons for making desirable cars that people want to buy and drive
[5935.94 --> 5938.10]  Why don't you do that? Why don't you focus on that?
[5938.10 --> 5942.90]  And worry a little bit less about how to squeeze more money out of the data you collect from your customers
[5943.86 --> 5947.70]  Just an just an idea crazy idea. I know
[5951.54 --> 5953.38]  Man this has been a really ranty show
[5954.42 --> 5954.66]  Yeah
[5956.26 --> 5957.22]  That's okay
[5957.22 --> 5960.58]  Speaking of rants have you uh have you uh launched your website yet?
[5960.58 --> 5961.94]  Yeah, really?
[5961.94 --> 5966.58]  Yeah, and uh, okay. Well, are we gonna are we gonna go to it?
[5968.42 --> 5970.58]  All right, here it is big test
[5972.18 --> 5974.18]  Might not work for you
[5974.18 --> 5974.98]  Oh, it did
[5974.98 --> 5975.54]  Boom
[5976.58 --> 5979.38]  So just to be like super clear for everyone this is
[5982.34 --> 5983.38]  This is basically
[5983.38 --> 5986.50]  The cat doesn't work with the keyboard. This is basically a click demo
[5986.90 --> 5987.62]  um
[5987.62 --> 5991.14]  You can mess around and see like what the web team has kind of been working on this is
[5991.14 --> 5995.22]  An extremely soft launch. Uh, looks pretty sweet. Yeah, exactly
[5995.22 --> 5998.10]  It's an extremely soft launch. This is not
[5998.98 --> 6000.42]  Like the posts
[6001.06 --> 6004.26]  You're gonna be expecting from the labs local team or anything like that
[6004.26 --> 6006.74]  This is just us messing around with the site
[6007.22 --> 6007.62]  um
[6008.42 --> 6011.06]  Think of it as like an alpha or something like that
[6011.06 --> 6013.06]  This is pre-alpha baby. Yeah, there you go
[6013.30 --> 6015.54]  Um, basically this is proof of concept
[6015.54 --> 6021.62]  We're just showing people where we're at now because we we leaked this on the wan show a long time ago
[6021.78 --> 6025.54]  And it's progressed since then and you can click around and see what it'll be like
[6025.54 --> 6028.26]  Yeah, you can see some of just like the art and site design
[6028.26 --> 6029.70]  Yeah, yeah stuff like that
[6029.70 --> 6031.70]  This is this is not a launch of like
[6032.10 --> 6038.50]  The actual lab site in the way and form that you should expect to use it once it's like fully flowing and going
[6038.98 --> 6039.70]  um
[6039.70 --> 6041.70]  That those things are not um
[6042.66 --> 6047.62]  In place yet. Um, but but the look and kind of general feel
[6048.26 --> 6052.58]  Is the direction that we're going in at least uh, we will collect some user feedback
[6052.58 --> 6053.86]  We'll see what people think about it
[6053.86 --> 6057.70]  I've already seen a couple comments that are interesting that we should probably um
[6059.30 --> 6063.94]  Like at least consider but I don't know necessarily if we should act on them or not. We'll see
[6065.70 --> 6067.78]  Lots of really positive comments appreciate that
[6067.78 --> 6074.66]  Um, the team's been working on this for a long time. Gary did a great job of these graphics. I love these header graphics
[6074.66 --> 6079.46]  Yeah, they're sweet super cool. Yeah, there's been so guys we are doing stuff for real
[6080.02 --> 6083.14]  Um, the team is working extremely hard. Um
[6084.10 --> 6090.74]  Like even just it figuring out what all of these headings should be. Yeah is a whole process
[6091.38 --> 6094.74]  getting that getting that coordinated with the um
[6095.38 --> 6099.46]  With the back end team with the front end team making sure that the whole experience is
[6100.10 --> 6101.30]  cohesive
[6101.30 --> 6105.54]  These are all placeholder graphs placeholder images placeholder absolutely
[6106.26 --> 6112.58]  Everything right now. It'll be really cool and you'll want to come back and all that kind of stuff when you know
[6112.82 --> 6116.50]  Actual like proper articles are being posted and stuff like that, which we're not there yet
[6116.50 --> 6120.90]  So this is not like an actual launch of the website nice. Yeah, exactly
[6121.46 --> 6124.58]  Um, there are none. We're basically just showing off like
[6125.46 --> 6127.94]  Look, you can you can click around you can get the usability
[6128.18 --> 6132.82]  Uh, something I would suggest people check out because I mean, I think it's really cool is if you click the
[6133.30 --> 6136.90]  Uh widget in the top right hand corner. Oh, do you want to talk about the compare cart? Oh, no
[6137.06 --> 6141.62]  Never mind. That's the widget in the top right corner and then click the toggle for customized colors on data charts
[6141.62 --> 6142.26]  Ooh
[6142.26 --> 6149.38]  Um now if you if you have color blindness issues or hey if you just prefer a different kind of palette of colors
[6149.38 --> 6152.02]  You can change what the different charts look like
[6152.74 --> 6158.98]  To help avoid colors that you might have issues with I I thought that was pretty neat because we have we have a lot of different
[6159.62 --> 6161.62]  Charts and stuff. Um
[6162.18 --> 6166.02]  Yeah, so yeah, there's cool things. There's cool stuff going on. Maybe you can look at it
[6166.02 --> 6170.26]  There won't be a lot to look at so I suspect you'll glance around for a little bit and then take off
[6170.26 --> 6172.34]  And that's fine because this is not an actual
[6173.22 --> 6175.22]  launch of the website, but um
[6175.78 --> 6178.74]  Yeah, I think it looks great. I'm excited to uh
[6179.30 --> 6180.98]  To get it out there. I think this is cool
[6181.62 --> 6187.06]  You can do things like uh using the compare cart stuff, but because there isn't
[6188.10 --> 6189.38]  uh
[6189.38 --> 6192.10]  A lot of stuff that would oh, yeah, okay, so you got an actual
[6193.06 --> 6198.42]  Yeah, so you have to find two products on the site that actually have like information to be able to get the compare cart working
[6198.42 --> 6201.46]  But this is what it looks like so you can kind of see them side by side
[6202.10 --> 6203.86]  Um and do an actual comparison
[6204.42 --> 6205.30]  um
[6205.30 --> 6208.58]  Yeah, so compare cart is sort of what we're calling for now
[6209.14 --> 6209.70]  um
[6209.70 --> 6211.86]  Yeah, like it's everything's for now
[6211.86 --> 6215.14]  It's kind of like it's it we call it a compare cart because it's like
[6215.62 --> 6220.42]  Like you're adding it to a cart like shopping like we wanted terminology that people could kind of
[6220.98 --> 6222.34]  relate to as you
[6223.14 --> 6226.50]  As you like yeah, maybe because if it just says compare up here
[6226.82 --> 6232.02]  Because as you go through it you might find things and you you add them to your cart similarly to if you were shopping on a store
[6232.02 --> 6235.22]  And you're adding things to your cart and then when you decide to
[6235.78 --> 6240.82]  Check out in this case. You're just looking at the comparison on the cart. You're not actually buying something. Um
[6241.78 --> 6243.78]  We're not we're not selling hardware through
[6244.02 --> 6246.26]  LTTlabs.com. Yeah, um
[6246.42 --> 6252.10]  We will probably collect affiliate revenue from you know if you if you navigate to something from here like we'll
[6252.10 --> 6254.10]  We'll have affiliate links and stuff like that. So
[6254.82 --> 6256.02]  um
[6256.02 --> 6261.38]  I just want to make sure that that's abundantly clear. Yeah. Yeah, and I mean hey, maybe in uh
[6261.38 --> 6263.94]  17 years we're selling hardware through the site. I don't know
[6264.34 --> 6268.50]  I'm not saying never but like it's not it's not a goal right now 17 years. Hey, well, I mean
[6269.14 --> 6271.14]  That's really specific
[6271.70 --> 6275.38]  In 16 and a half years in 36 quarters
[6276.42 --> 6278.42]  the goal will be
[6278.42 --> 6280.42]  um
[6282.10 --> 6282.66]  Yeah
[6282.66 --> 6283.78]  Yeah
[6283.78 --> 6287.46]  It's hard to make quarterly goals for software development. Let's make quarterly goals for
[6288.02 --> 6292.50]  For everything for 30 quarters from now. Let's see how those hold up
[6293.54 --> 6297.54]  Yeah, yeah, I'm actually thank you for all the very positive comments. Um
[6298.42 --> 6301.46]  That's very cool. I appreciate it. Yeah, I've been this has been kind of
[6302.58 --> 6304.58]  In the cooker for a really long time, so
[6304.82 --> 6306.90]  And it will continue to be in the cooker some more
[6306.90 --> 6310.58]  Yeah, I need some more need some more cooking still but it's um
[6311.14 --> 6313.54]  It's one of those things where launching a site
[6314.82 --> 6317.30]  When everyone else and their dog has
[6318.26 --> 6321.14]  Been building their sites for in some cases 10 or 20 years
[6321.70 --> 6322.18]  uh
[6322.18 --> 6326.42]  It's tough right because you're on the one hand you're looking at it going well
[6326.42 --> 6330.42]  Yeah, they have a lot of legacy crap to deal with that is probably a burden for them
[6330.42 --> 6336.26]  But on the other hand, they've had a lot of time to solve problems and and figure out user flows and and
[6336.82 --> 6340.82]  You know really clean ways of presenting their information and their data and all that good stuff
[6341.46 --> 6345.78]  One of the things that you'll notice is that it is extremely advertising light
[6346.42 --> 6351.78]  Uh, that is not an accident there will definitely be some promotional materials on the site
[6351.78 --> 6357.54]  We will almost certainly have uh, you know links to where to buy a screwdriver to install that graphics card
[6357.54 --> 6359.54]  You're researching or whatever the case may be
[6359.86 --> 6362.82]  But there are people with salaries who made this but right now
[6363.62 --> 6364.98]  um
[6365.06 --> 6370.82]  Right now it is it is not the plan to have a ton of advertising on it. Um
[6370.82 --> 6377.46]  Um, it's just as far as there's other ways that are less annoying than advertising that we can make money. Yeah, um
[6378.02 --> 6378.82]  affiliate revenue
[6379.30 --> 6382.66]  Um, self-referencing back to our own things like our own videos and whatnot
[6383.30 --> 6385.30]  Um, yeah, there's other stuff
[6385.30 --> 6385.62]  Yeah
[6386.26 --> 6390.82]  Lot of work to do a lot of work to do, um, especially on the content side
[6391.38 --> 6396.10]  But uh, it's exciting. It's it's a really really exciting time
[6397.06 --> 6398.50]  Feeling feeling really good
[6398.50 --> 6400.50]  Yeah
[6401.46 --> 6406.18]  So yeah, like I said, you can poke around but there there really isn't like a ton to do on the site right now
[6406.18 --> 6407.78]  It just looks really good though
[6407.78 --> 6412.02]  But yeah, we wanted to show off kind of like what it looks like and what it feels like, I guess
[6412.02 --> 6415.62]  Um, not what the articles from necessarily exactly be like stuff like that
[6415.62 --> 6420.42]  Man, there's just like there's so many little things like that, you know, you can navigate like this
[6420.42 --> 6424.58]  Yeah, ooh, look at that or go to see the tested settings
[6424.58 --> 6426.50]  There's some cool examples of some graphs too
[6426.50 --> 6428.50]  Um
[6429.06 --> 6433.06]  Yeah, I love the key actuation graphs. Those are just the coolest thing i've seen a long time
[6433.70 --> 6438.82]  Yeah, the if you go to the uh, amd radeon rx 7600
[6438.82 --> 6442.02]  Oh, yeah, that's right roll down it's per key as well gaming
[6442.02 --> 6448.02]  So you could see the actuation of the space bar and see the difference between that and the enter key
[6448.58 --> 6453.62]  And that and the uh, you know, arrow left arrow key or whatever the case may be. Sorry. Actually, I go to your
[6454.10 --> 6455.46]  Oh, you can sure. Yeah
[6456.02 --> 6459.62]  Yeah, so then and I can like look at like oh i'm gonna look at this and then it
[6459.62 --> 6461.62]  It changes oh my goodness
[6462.74 --> 6464.18]  Oh, it update that's beautiful
[6465.14 --> 6466.34]  Look at that. So cool
[6467.14 --> 6471.14]  Super cool. What do I care more about minimums averages?
[6471.70 --> 6471.86]  Yeah
[6471.86 --> 6473.86]  Yeah
[6474.58 --> 6474.98]  Yeah
[6474.98 --> 6480.02]  A lot of work a lot of work going into it. We're gonna it's gonna be it's gonna be great guys. Yeah
[6481.30 --> 6481.70]  All right
[6481.70 --> 6484.74]  Oh, right
[6484.74 --> 6488.82]  We should talk about sponsors speaking of paying for all the work that's been done on all of this

[6626.18 --> 6630.90]  Oh, they want to be the last one of the year of course they do wants me to say something nice to them
[6632.18 --> 6636.58]  Because they've had so much fun messing with me throughout the year
[6637.22 --> 6643.14]  I'm supposed to say something nice to them because they messed with me. They sent me broken glass
[6643.62 --> 6645.62]  shortlinis.com
[6645.62 --> 6649.54]  Okay, dennis compiled the best clips this year for you to enjoy
[6650.34 --> 6653.70]  Dan is to roll the clips and we are to just watch it
[6654.98 --> 6659.54]  Did dbrand actually ship me a box of glass shards?
[6662.02 --> 6664.02]  Oh my god
[6665.86 --> 6674.74]  Dbrand thanks oh my god
[6675.62 --> 6678.34]  Neat
[6678.34 --> 6679.06]  um
[6679.94 --> 6683.94]  After the clip very briefly talk about the long-term partnership with dbrand yes
[6684.50 --> 6688.02]  That has been a thing. I mean we uh, we do more than just you know
[6689.14 --> 6693.14]  Shill their products and send us bags of money. Um, we've
[6693.14 --> 6695.14]  We've
[6695.14 --> 6702.42]  We know people there. They know people here. We we're we're more than just but just money exchanging and product shilling
[6703.06 --> 6708.18]  Um, man, sorry. I'm a little flustered those I I forgot about that stupid bill
[6708.18 --> 6718.66]  The point is that they're one of the first places that we go for advice when you know, we're we run into a trouble, you know
[6719.38 --> 6724.26]  We're operationally logistically, you know, hey, you know, what's been your experience with this and um, you know,
[6724.26 --> 6730.58]  They come to us when when they're coming up against something that they've never seen before like we we work we work together
[6730.82 --> 6732.82]  I guess is the best way of putting it
[6732.98 --> 6734.98]  um, and dbrand
[6734.98 --> 6740.74]  Has stuck with us through thick and thin you guys might remember that dbrand was the first sponsor
[6741.54 --> 6743.62]  to come back on wan show after the
[6744.18 --> 6751.46]  challenging summer that we had and I said at the time that that made sense to me because um dbrand knows us
[6752.02 --> 6754.02]  um
[6755.46 --> 6757.94]  I'm not at liberty to say more than that at this time
[6757.94 --> 6763.38]  But dbrand knows us dbrand knows stuff dbrand knows that uh sticking with us is going to be cool
[6763.70 --> 6766.90]  And we know the same thing about them. There's a lot of there's a lot of trust there
[6767.46 --> 6774.66]  We wouldn't even consider you know working with a case defy or someone like that in the past not because I knew at the time that you know
[6774.66 --> 6777.30]  They were allegedly stealing designs
[6777.30 --> 6783.30]  Uh, but because just we we know that dbrand's going to take care of things when that comes to you know
[6783.30 --> 6786.98]  Whether it's our customers or whether it's making sure that their products are just kind of awesome
[6787.54 --> 6788.34]  um
[6788.34 --> 6789.86]  We we we trust them
[6789.86 --> 6793.54]  um, so they've got some new x-ray skins for all sorts of devices
[6793.54 --> 6798.98]  uh, these skins were scanned at a specialized meteorology lab and dbrand is offering you both
[6798.98 --> 6804.26]  Oh, that's cool light and dark mode variants for the price of one
[6804.90 --> 6812.66]  Happy new year and check out dbrand at dbrand.com slash when wow did they really give me a reasonable vanity url for a change?
[6813.06 --> 6817.54]  How nice is that is that is that their new year's resolution to not be heads?
[6818.02 --> 6818.26]  No
[6818.26 --> 6821.94]  Yeah, I kind of didn't think so definitely not super cool
[6822.90 --> 6823.54]  I hope not
[6825.30 --> 6830.34]  Wow, all right. Thank you for that. Sorry. I got I got really thrown off on that read
[6831.30 --> 6833.30]  stupid billboard
[6833.46 --> 6835.46]  I had family members
[6835.46 --> 6839.62]  Asking me about that stupid billboard like it was in vancouver
[6840.18 --> 6843.30]  It was like on a high traffic street. It probably wasn't cheap
[6843.30 --> 6848.42]  I don't know how much they spent on that stupid thing, but like I'd have people being like oh
[6848.42 --> 6852.66]  I saw your new car. I was like well, I haven't shown you my new car. I didn't even tell you I got a new car. No
[6852.66 --> 6854.66]  Yeah, no, I saw your picture on the billboard
[6859.46 --> 6860.90]  That's pretty cool
[6860.90 --> 6862.90]  Anyway
[6864.74 --> 6869.14]  Vbrand.com slash when I like it. It's got a nice ring to it. It's pretty good. Yeah
[6869.14 --> 6876.66]  Short line is pretty good too though. All right. Short line is easier to remember simmer down. That's true. Yeah, they should work on their branding
[6879.38 --> 6881.22]  Well, that's the whole thing is d branding
[6881.70 --> 6886.10]  It's just unbranding. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, wait, you didn't you didn't know that?
[6887.14 --> 6889.14]  This guy this guy man
[6891.22 --> 6898.18]  No, really though, and you know that one I did okay good. I can't tell I can't tell slash s with this guy you don't deserve to anymore
[6898.90 --> 6903.94]  I think I think I have lost the privilege to be able to
[6905.22 --> 6909.46]  Feign ignorance anymore Dan defense dot xc has crashed is not responding. Yeah
[6910.10 --> 6915.14]  Okay, anyway Dan, do you want to put some merch messages? I'm gonna try man. Okay, uh, Linus
[6915.14 --> 6919.38]  I assume you don't purchase expensive or designer clothes often since creator warehouse
[6919.38 --> 6925.46]  There's a full stop right there
[6926.42 --> 6933.70]  No, okay since creator warehouse has designed more garments has your willingness to spend more for quality materials or construction change
[6933.94 --> 6938.66]  Oh, I've never been unwilling to spend on quality materials in construction
[6939.38 --> 6942.82]  My issue is that the majority of the time
[6943.54 --> 6945.54]  I don't see a clear correlation
[6946.02 --> 6946.82]  between
[6946.82 --> 6952.18]  the difference in price and the difference in the quality of the materials and construction
[6952.82 --> 6953.94]  That's my issue
[6954.50 --> 6956.50]  with fashion like I I have I
[6957.06 --> 6960.82]  I don't know Luke. Have you ever known me to have a problem spending on quality? No
[6960.82 --> 6966.90]  I it's not an issue really paying for brands and paying for
[6967.46 --> 6972.98]  Strictly aesthetics is not really a thing. I want bang for the buck and i'll do aesthetics sometimes
[6973.38 --> 6980.82]  Not necessarily bang for the buck either. No like you might pay for something that is particularly of premium quality
[6981.38 --> 6983.38]  Because you respect like the craftsmanship
[6984.02 --> 6987.78]  Or because you're like yeah, I paid more for this, but this will last for literal ever
[6988.98 --> 6993.54]  Something like that. Oh 100% might not be technically best value per dollar
[6994.34 --> 6995.86]  um
[6995.86 --> 6998.58]  This was my case back before I designed my own yeah
[6998.58 --> 7004.74]  Like this is a this is an expensive case 350 dollar computer case
[7005.62 --> 7006.34]  it's
[7006.34 --> 7007.62]  amazing
[7007.62 --> 7008.98]  this
[7008.98 --> 7010.02]  oh my god my mouse
[7011.30 --> 7012.18]  all along
[7013.14 --> 7014.02]  All along here
[7014.82 --> 7018.74]  all down the front and all down the bottom is one
[7019.46 --> 7021.14]  single piece of aluminum
[7022.18 --> 7023.94]  That is it's shaped look
[7024.74 --> 7028.34]  Like it's uh, it's thin in the middle and thick around the edges
[7028.34 --> 7034.74]  The craftsmanship of this thing is absolutely incredible. I have no problem
[7035.46 --> 7036.82]  Spending on quality
[7037.38 --> 7042.02]  My issue is where I just can't find a relationship
[7042.50 --> 7045.06]  Between the price and the level of quality
[7045.70 --> 7047.70]  um
[7047.70 --> 7049.70]  And I just
[7049.94 --> 7052.90]  Trying to think like where where did I get clothes from?
[7053.62 --> 7062.82]  Mostly costco and it was mostly fine and and as soon as something was not fine at costco like the champion socks that I used to buy there
[7063.22 --> 7065.30]  They went from lasting me years
[7065.86 --> 7068.66]  To I would put holes in them in like six months
[7069.14 --> 7075.62]  Um, and and I could tell like I had my old ones and my new ones and like the the weave density was way lower on the new ones
[7075.62 --> 7076.58]  They are
[7076.58 --> 7080.42]  Fucking garbage now they're trash now and when that happened
[7080.82 --> 7085.06]  um, I went looking for a new sock and I ended up with darn tough who
[7086.26 --> 7091.78]  Makes great socks. They're just they're great. Um, they're they're outstanding
[7092.26 --> 7095.70]  Really expensive. It's like 20 to 25 us dollars per pair
[7095.70 --> 7103.22]  But yeah lifetime warranty and the quality is unmatched like I would I would go through an entire pack of those costco socks
[7103.54 --> 7107.86]  And one pair of darn tufts would still be standing so I can't fault that right
[7108.50 --> 7108.82]  um
[7110.90 --> 7112.66]  No, man, I uh
[7112.90 --> 7118.50]  Yeah, i'm sorry. I I I don't I don't agree or I shouldn't say I don't agree. I I definitely
[7118.50 --> 7127.62]  Appreciate function more than form and I I see more value to function, but I can appreciate form
[7128.18 --> 7133.22]  um, but it's it's only I pick my battles, I guess like I didn't care about my car looking cool
[7134.18 --> 7137.94]  But I did care about my pc looking cool. I didn't care about having a nice desk
[7138.26 --> 7143.14]  But I definitely cared about having a nice desk pad and a sturdy desk. Um, oh, no
[7143.14 --> 7147.62]  My desk was like a complete piece of shit until I not now not no not now
[7148.18 --> 7150.18]  um
[7151.14 --> 7157.30]  I'm thinking back though. I'm also thinking back to you know before I just was very not sturdy back then
[7157.30 --> 7160.18]  Yeah, yeah back in the day, but then you're you're picking your battles, right?
[7160.90 --> 7165.06]  Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's a huge thing is is that like you can't afford to have
[7165.62 --> 7170.74]  Nice everything so you've got to decide on things right? You can't just have like a super nice everything and to me
[7171.54 --> 7173.54]  You know a wallet
[7173.54 --> 7175.54]  It's a really low priority
[7175.54 --> 7178.82]  I would much rather have money in the wallet than money
[7179.62 --> 7182.50]  In the wallet if you kind of get what I mean
[7183.06 --> 7187.78]  Uh, like if I if I had so much money that it didn't affect anything at all
[7189.14 --> 7193.62]  Actually, no, I still wouldn't buy a fancy wallet. I just I just don't see uh
[7193.62 --> 7198.26]  I don't see a ton of value to that quality. Yes, I don't mind like I I won't spend 10 bucks
[7198.90 --> 7201.06]  I will I'll have no problem spending, you know
[7201.54 --> 7206.50]  50 or 75 or 100 bucks, but there's no way I'd spend a thousand dollars on a wallet
[7206.50 --> 7209.78]  I'm, sorry, but there's no material you could make it out of that would make me
[7210.98 --> 7214.34]  Buy a wallet for a thousand dollars and guys don't kid yourselves that exists
[7214.34 --> 7218.82]  All right, dan hit me sure
[7219.14 --> 7224.66]  Um international airline pilot here backpack is the best flight bag i've ever used
[7225.22 --> 7229.70]  Are any of you or anyone at lmg aviation enthusiasts or pilots?
[7231.38 --> 7233.46]  Not that I can think of sounds expensive
[7233.46 --> 7238.26]  Joe has a pilot's license really yeah not for like
[7239.78 --> 7242.42]  Commercial aircraft like your gamer buddy or the one that we work with
[7244.42 --> 7246.02]  It's a bit of an in joke don't worry about it
[7247.62 --> 7254.10]  He hadn't he hadn't uh seen that clip and then one of his friends sent it to him and he was like oh no
[7256.82 --> 7259.38]  He actually saw it like I think a week or two ago
[7259.38 --> 7268.58]  Um, I didn't realize that joe that I had gamed with many times over a span of years was the same joe who works for float plane
[7269.54 --> 7270.42]  Um
[7270.42 --> 7275.94]  For years he had met him in in real life and everything, but I don't think we had games together in real life. No
[7276.90 --> 7279.62]  So that didn't really actually like change anything
[7280.50 --> 7285.78]  Pretty funny. Yeah, um, yeah, no, it was very much meant for
[7286.58 --> 7290.50]  Travel and not necessarily just plain travel it was meant for
[7291.22 --> 7297.62]  I've got to go places i've got to have my stuff with me and like that's my that's my lifestyle is
[7297.62 --> 7299.62]  I i gotta carry a lot of stuff
[7299.62 --> 7304.18]  I never know when i'm gonna need an ethernet crimper tool and i'd never know when i'm gonna need
[7304.66 --> 7310.90]  My work laptop or my personal laptop or i'm reviewing a device or whatever else it is and and there's there's two kinds of people
[7310.90 --> 7312.98]  There's people that look at the backpack and go well
[7312.98 --> 7317.06]  This is just a generic backpack that's overpriced and it's stupid and the people who have it
[7318.42 --> 7319.62]  like
[7319.62 --> 7321.62]  Yeah, it was very much designed
[7322.82 --> 7329.54]  For the people who love it and you see posts on reddit and stuff of people with like two laptops and a tablet and like their
[7329.94 --> 7337.46]  And their uh portable gaming pc or whatever and then they've got like a weekend worth of clothes packed in the in the bag of holding
[7337.46 --> 7342.10]  And they've got you know all their like game carts and everything organized in the front and it's like yeah
[7342.98 --> 7344.98]  That's who we made it for
[7345.14 --> 7347.14]  And if it's that's not you that's fine
[7348.02 --> 7349.30]  That's cool
[7349.30 --> 7353.14]  You know what not buying it is totally an option totally fine
[7353.54 --> 7356.18]  Yeah, it's it's amazing how many people get angry
[7356.74 --> 7361.54]  About a product that wasn't made for them. I think that's uh, man am I really going to talk about the ps portal again?
[7361.54 --> 7368.18]  Like how angry people were about a product that they didn't make for you just chill
[7368.74 --> 7372.34]  Just let other people enjoy it in their defense. We do that sometimes
[7373.78 --> 7379.46]  That is true, but in the case of the ps portal. I even went out of my way in the video to kind of outline
[7380.66 --> 7382.42]  Why you can't complain about the price?
[7383.38 --> 7385.54]  You can you can not buy it
[7386.50 --> 7388.50]  That's fine
[7388.50 --> 7397.22]  It is so comparable so obviously comparable to other items that people are not upset about yeah show me
[7397.94 --> 7401.86]  anything with a screen a quality controller a
[7404.02 --> 7410.66]  You know arm chipset with wireless and bluetooth and like all that stuff that it has show me of that
[7411.22 --> 7416.34]  That isn't some aliexpress piece of garbage for under 200 bucks. I'm sorry that doesn't exist
[7416.34 --> 7418.98]  This is not an unreasonable price for what it is
[7420.18 --> 7425.94]  I don't like that. It's locked down. You know, I talked even in the video about wanting to see it jailbroken
[7426.58 --> 7429.46]  There's things I don't like about it. You don't have to buy it
[7430.26 --> 7431.94]  But it is what it is
[7431.94 --> 7433.54]  And it's not an unreasonable price for it
[7433.54 --> 7435.62]  And you know you have people saying oh, it should be 99 dollars
[7435.62 --> 7438.18]  It should should would be what are you even talking about?
[7438.18 --> 7443.14]  It's not that's not what something like that costs you go make one then good luck with that
[7446.34 --> 7449.14]  Do you want another one?
[7450.18 --> 7452.18]  Yeah, yeah, I'm with one more
[7452.98 --> 7455.70]  Sure, I want the top one. You want the top one? I want to know how it's going
[7456.66 --> 7457.78]  Luke
[7457.78 --> 7458.58]  Hey, what's up?
[7458.58 --> 7460.42]  These millennials are always on their phones
[7460.42 --> 7460.58]  I
[7460.58 --> 7463.22]  I thought you weren't at work, sir
[7463.22 --> 7471.70]  Question for Luke. Are you enjoying Final Fantasy 6? Also, please tell me you changed the font setting from modern to classic since the default setting is an affront to humanity
[7472.58 --> 7475.70]  There's no way he changed that. I don't know if I knew that was an option
[7476.42 --> 7480.34]  I did look through the options when I first started playing so I might have seen that have you played it anymore?
[7480.82 --> 7481.38]  I've tried
[7482.18 --> 7484.02]  What is your computer still crashing? Yeah
[7484.90 --> 7487.62]  I thought it was the problem that it's having right now
[7488.50 --> 7491.22]  Is that it's it's i've never i've never had this problem before
[7491.86 --> 7493.86]  This is a totally new thing
[7494.02 --> 7498.98]  But it's when I enter certain areas in certain games
[7498.98 --> 7501.38]  Tarkov just wiped
[7502.10 --> 7504.98]  So usually at the beginning of a wipe event the cheating is not that bad
[7505.38 --> 7506.58]  So i've been playing Tarkov
[7507.06 --> 7509.78]  Tarkov can hit your computer decently hard even though it's an old game
[7509.78 --> 7512.26]  Yeah, zero crashes in Tarkov. No problems
[7513.14 --> 7517.54]  No problems. I enter that town with all the lying people in Final Fantasy 6
[7520.50 --> 7521.14]  Driver dies
[7521.14 --> 7524.26]  And there are other games as well
[7524.26 --> 7524.98]  That's bizarre dude
[7524.98 --> 7528.66]  Where it's very specific areas. I'll enter a specific area
[7528.90 --> 7532.50]  It doesn't feel like there's any different graphics elements
[7533.06 --> 7536.50]  Like oh, this has a smoke effect or something. It doesn't feel like that
[7537.06 --> 7542.02]  But i'll enter a specific area and crashes like crazy. Sometimes i'll try to like force through it
[7542.74 --> 7546.34]  Like driver will crash computer will recover and i'll try to pull myself through it
[7546.34 --> 7548.82]  Sometimes I can get through that area and then it'll be stable again
[7550.02 --> 7555.30]  Um, and the issue with zozo is i'm stuck there for so long that eventually it'll just hard crash
[7555.78 --> 7556.50]  Okay, well
[7557.30 --> 7559.46]  Do you know that you're getting a new computer?
[7560.50 --> 7564.02]  Uh, yeah, but no one will tell me anything about it cool. Perfect, which I don't know if I like
[7564.74 --> 7568.10]  Good. Maybe I do like maybe probably not like okay
[7569.30 --> 7574.50]  So I will remind you that I work from home. Oh, yeah. Okay, so if it's bad, that's your problem
[7574.50 --> 7577.06]  Well, well, then I guess uh, sounds like you'll need to do more driving then
[7577.62 --> 7578.98]  Okay
[7579.06 --> 7579.86]  Sure
[7579.86 --> 7584.26]  I can work less efficiently at work. I had dan and I had this conversation recently
[7584.82 --> 7587.30]  This was fun. How much work did you get done this week dan?
[7587.70 --> 7594.18]  Like uh, the end of the quarter push in two days. Yeah, that's pretty cool. It's a lot of math. Yeah, it's all good now. Yeah
[7594.98 --> 7596.98]  Yeah, he's not gonna take your bait luke
[7598.90 --> 7603.54]  No, he did what what I thought I thought he said he got a lot of work done. Yeah, yeah
[7603.54 --> 7609.54]  Because he worked from home. Yeah. Oh, so people bugged him less. Okay, I got sick. Did you tell him the
[7610.18 --> 7612.18]  This new spreadsheet thing's great
[7612.82 --> 7617.06]  Yeah, tracking tracking interruptions. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[7617.62 --> 7620.74]  I was just observing one day while I was sitting there. I was like wow
[7621.62 --> 7627.70]  Um, if I was dan I wouldn't have gotten any work done today because there was just people at his desk the whole day
[7628.50 --> 7632.98]  So I was like, all right, I need to start tracking like who what department and how long
[7633.38 --> 7636.98]  Yeah, so we can like figure out what the heck is going on because I
[7637.62 --> 7640.58]  Put pressure on this a few months back. Yeah, and then it was better
[7641.22 --> 7646.42]  For a considerable amount of time and now it's like really bad again. Oh, that comes in waves for me as well
[7646.42 --> 7650.58]  I still go out of my way to not bug dan. I don't I don't know if it's yeah, but it wasn't just you
[7650.98 --> 7653.14]  Well, yeah, but we don't have like a lot of people
[7653.14 --> 7657.22]  We don't have conversations and you also are allowed to make me do things
[7657.22 --> 7661.06]  Yeah, that's one of the caveats. Yeah, right. Yeah, but I try not to
[7661.70 --> 7663.70]  Yeah, exactly. I can't remember
[7664.10 --> 7668.74]  I can probably count on on one hand the amount of times that you've been like hey, I need you to do a thing, please
[7669.38 --> 7672.58]  And it's never been that disruptive. So it's all good. All right. No, good
[7673.14 --> 7678.10]  I got a chronograph thing for my watch so I can just like oh you want to want to talk to me
[7678.18 --> 7680.34]  Okay, well now I'm timing it. Corey G
[7680.34 --> 7684.74]  Um says dan needs a go away. Don't bug me sign. He actually has one. I put it back up
[7684.74 --> 7688.50]  It felt really mean I was doing a push for luke one one monday
[7688.82 --> 7694.66]  And like I had to just flow state for eight hours straight. Otherwise, it would have died. Yeah, um, so I put that up
[7694.82 --> 7696.82]  and it's uh
[7696.82 --> 7699.78]  It's still a problem though. I didn't think people still come up to your desk
[7700.26 --> 7702.42]  And then you have to stop and point at it
[7703.06 --> 7709.22]  And like you might be able to keep flow that doesn't break it. Okay, good taking off my headphones and like for some people that can break it
[7709.22 --> 7711.06]  So i'm happy that doesn't oh, yeah, I'm good
[7711.06 --> 7715.54]  I'm officially more distractible than 10 then remember when I used to have a do not disturb sign on my office
[7716.58 --> 7718.58]  People would like come to the window like
[7719.70 --> 7720.90]  It's like
[7720.90 --> 7724.18]  Well, you you you're one of the ones who actually read it
[7725.06 --> 7726.50]  And you're still
[7726.50 --> 7731.46]  I mean sure come on in apparently it's urgent then that would break it right if I have to be like
[7731.78 --> 7734.82]  Okay, now I need to assess if you actually need to talk to me
[7735.06 --> 7738.74]  But if somebody's watching approaching me and I can just tap the top of my monitor
[7738.74 --> 7745.06]  But yeah, it was a lot of time and I think it might be a mixture of factors one of them being like quarterly end
[7745.86 --> 7749.62]  Um, so if someone's like I need help with this the pressure feels really high
[7750.34 --> 7752.58]  So they're coming like oh, this is really important. I need help right now
[7752.58 --> 7757.14]  You know, I got a lot done this week too in the office because so many people are off
[7758.34 --> 7763.94]  So the office was actually less disruptive this week as well. Yeah, so I think it's a combination of things
[7763.94 --> 7770.26]  You guys might have been interrupted more at home if it what hadn't been for that like a quarter of the company is off right now
[7770.26 --> 7775.78]  Interesting one of one of the problems that I think i've identified is the work culture here is like really pleasant
[7775.78 --> 7780.42]  And I like all my co-workers and we're all really friendly and it's a nice environment. So that's kind of
[7781.06 --> 7784.74]  Yeah, it's a double-edged sword though. It's not a social club
[7784.74 --> 7789.38]  We have to get stuff done somehow. I know but everybody's nice. I know
[7790.42 --> 7792.42]  That's by design, Dan
[7792.42 --> 7794.42]  That's yeah, that's why I'm framing it like that
[7794.98 --> 7800.02]  um, but but yeah, I mean sometimes there's a point where where it's like hey, and I'll wave and then it's
[7801.38 --> 7808.02]  Yeah, that's that that area in general is just kind of hard to work because you're in a you're in a hallway
[7808.18 --> 7812.90]  Yeah, and it's a hallway that has an increasing amount of people that need to flow through it all the time
[7812.90 --> 7816.26]  Maybe we should redirect people to the social
[7817.54 --> 7819.06]  Hallway
[7819.06 --> 7822.02]  But then are we just diverting the problem? Yeah
[7823.06 --> 7828.58]  I think a lot of it is I trained people over a year to be like no ask me to do things i'm here to you know
[7828.58 --> 7833.46]  Because that was kind of what he was actually sort of the grease in the cogs right that sort of thing
[7834.02 --> 7841.06]  Um, but I don't know it might be a positioning thing as well. Could we just punch a hole into the warehouse from where that weird shower is?
[7841.06 --> 7845.54]  I could just sit in that back room. I get so much work done. No, I don't mean for you
[7845.54 --> 7849.86]  What weird shower for a hallway? I mean the weird shower next to the kitchenette
[7850.50 --> 7852.50]  Have you never seen the weird shower?
[7852.50 --> 7858.90]  The weird shower that's a weird shower. Yeah, there's a weird shower. It works. I don't know. Yeah, which is weird
[7859.14 --> 7865.22]  It's right next to your office. Yeah, you actually sit next to the shower. You are probably you could probably stand up
[7865.22 --> 7873.54]  And turn your arms and if there wasn't a wall there one of your hands would get wet if the shower was on
[7873.70 --> 7880.50]  So if you were going to the bathroom that's near the kitchen you'd go right? Yeah, there's a weird shower there
[7880.82 --> 7885.06]  Huh, I don't think i've ever opened that door. Well inside. Maybe I didn't just forgot
[7885.30 --> 7890.42]  There's you'd never believe what's in behind that door a weird shower. Oh, shoot. You got it. How'd you get it?
[7890.42 --> 7894.42]  I don't know. Yeah, there's also paper towels
[7895.14 --> 7900.02]  Stop using the phrase weird shower. It's getting weird. It is a weird shower
[7901.46 --> 7905.14]  It's in a metal fan. Six of three says luke suddenly thinking I can shower at work. Yeah
[7905.78 --> 7911.54]  That would be a benefit if the gym didn't also have a shower and then not wanting to be stinky and sweaty and gross in your own car
[7912.26 --> 7914.26]  um
[7914.26 --> 7916.26]  Now i'm lost. I'll just solve that problem elsewhere
[7916.26 --> 7921.30]  Yeah, luke was one of the ones who asked and asked and asked for a shower at work. I don't think he ever used it
[7921.94 --> 7923.94]  No, I wanted to and I did actually
[7924.34 --> 7929.30]  Two problems here three really we used to do channel super funds that were outside and active and also
[7929.78 --> 7934.42]  Often resulted in being covered in random stuff that you needed to clean up from
[7935.46 --> 7942.02]  I asked and asked and asked for a shower because of that we got a shower it had what I would refer to as negative water pressure
[7942.02 --> 7948.50]  Um, so you couldn't actually have an actual shower the what I did the one time I was in there was I grabbed a cloth
[7948.50 --> 7952.50]  And I would hold it under the shower head until it was soaked and then I would just like
[7953.06 --> 7955.46]  There's nothing we can do about the water pressure in that building
[7956.10 --> 7961.86]  Yeah, but it wasn't used because it was actually not useful. It's usable now. It wasn't then. Oh, yeah
[7962.42 --> 7964.58]  Now we don't do channels super fund anymore. Well, I don't know
[7965.14 --> 7971.94]  So it kind of lost its purpose. I've been used its whole purpose was because of channels super fund all for Ivan would by
[7971.94 --> 7975.14]  To work and then that's cool and then shower when he got here. Yeah
[7976.18 --> 7980.82]  Um, yeah, wraith says every company I worked for had a shower. It was basically just for the runners. Yeah
[7981.30 --> 7985.62]  Yeah, so we we do we have two showers now we have shower and weird shower
[7988.18 --> 7991.06]  I don't think anyone at the labs building would need a shower though
[7991.14 --> 7992.42]  So maybe we could just yeah
[7992.42 --> 7997.70]  Maybe we could just like punch a hole through there and turn it into a hallway and then people wouldn't have to walk through there to get to the lab
[7998.26 --> 8000.50]  We could just kind of not close it off but like
[8001.94 --> 8006.10]  Be like hey, don't please. Yeah, all right. It's just it is it is actually like
[8007.86 --> 8012.18]  Pretty sure describing because yeah people like it's not people trying to be jerks people trying to be nice
[8012.42 --> 8018.90]  Yeah, so when they walk through they're saying hi because it's a generally fairly nice and that's not super distracting but that people
[8019.46 --> 8020.58]  I don't know
[8020.74 --> 8024.82]  Oh, have you seen this cool crazy thing we're doing in the lab or have you seen this
[8025.30 --> 8029.62]  Crazy thing that we're writing about for or even it's just this should have been a team's message
[8029.62 --> 8032.58]  Yeah, that's a thing. Yeah, I think there's some like
[8033.30 --> 8033.78]  uh
[8033.78 --> 8036.02]  On-site organizational efficiency stuff
[8036.58 --> 8040.02]  Um, it's just faster in regards to the this should have been a team's message thing
[8040.74 --> 8045.14]  That could that could maybe happen. Okay, well I fired over a request. Um
[8045.86 --> 8049.22]  Meanwhile, the indian government is investigating apple
[8049.22 --> 8051.22]  Uh, this was uh
[8051.22 --> 8055.78]  Mm sources are washington post and al jazeera in response to apple warning
[8056.18 --> 8056.74]  over
[8056.74 --> 8060.58]  20 indian journalists and opposition politicians
[8061.06 --> 8065.30]  That government hackers tried to compromise their iphones back in october
[8065.78 --> 8070.02]  The indian government has announced an investigation into apple
[8070.50 --> 8075.22]  Indian officials publicly questioned whether apple's threat detection algorithms were faulty
[8075.22 --> 8080.42]  But according to sources speaking to the washington post senior members of the modi administration
[8080.42 --> 8082.98]  contacted apple representatives in india privately
[8083.46 --> 8089.06]  to demand that the company help soften the political impact of the warnings and
[8089.62 --> 8096.10]  They summoned an apple security expert from outside the country to a meeting in new delhi and pressured them to
[8096.74 --> 8098.74]  come up with alternative
[8099.14 --> 8101.62]  explanations for the warnings to users
[8101.62 --> 8103.78]  Oh
[8103.78 --> 8108.10]  Senior apple executives reportedly found the indian government's demands
[8108.66 --> 8109.38]  disturbing
[8110.10 --> 8118.26]  Forensic analysis by amnesty international has found that several journalists and politicians phones were compromised using pegasus
[8118.74 --> 8122.58]  a well-known spyware that is sold only to governments
[8123.86 --> 8129.06]  Our discussion question is how does a company like apple balance its promises to users
[8129.06 --> 8133.78]  With pressure from various governments sometimes in jurisdictions where?
[8135.38 --> 8139.46]  At their whim they could prevent apple from manufacturing iphones
[8140.02 --> 8141.94]  At all and the answer is
[8142.66 --> 8145.22]  They can't at the end of the day
[8145.54 --> 8149.62]  They are going to bow to the government requests every single time
[8150.02 --> 8154.02]  Well, I shouldn't say every single time but they're going to bow wherever it is
[8154.02 --> 8158.50]  necessary and by necessary I mean wherever it would prevent them from
[8159.30 --> 8167.46]  Making iphones anymore. I mean that's why apple has data centers that hold all of their chinese users information in china
[8169.54 --> 8172.98]  And that's why apple's claims that they take user privacy
[8173.62 --> 8176.98]  extremely seriously have always come across a little bit
[8177.62 --> 8182.90]  Empty to me and like server location is very important. There's a lot like especially in china
[8182.90 --> 8189.06]  Educational uh facilities in in or educational institutions
[8189.06 --> 8194.74]  That's the word i was looking for in canada for instance, uh, you have to have data stored in canada
[8195.62 --> 8198.50]  And if you look at like business and education level software
[8199.14 --> 8207.30]  Like teams for example, you can choose to have your data stored only in your own local country in order to be data compliant with a variety of different things
[8207.30 --> 8210.02]  Um, this is something that a lot of places take seriously
[8210.42 --> 8215.46]  So having all that stuff also stored in china. Yeah, but the chinese ones are really sketchy
[8216.18 --> 8218.10]  Because apple doesn't own the data centers even
[8218.90 --> 8223.06]  No, that's part of what i'm saying like it's a big red flag. This is this is a big and
[8223.70 --> 8227.54]  commonly looked for red flag is what i'm kind of trying to paint
[8228.26 --> 8232.74]  Is that like education and business and all this kind of stuff they all they all look for this as a red flag, right?
[8233.46 --> 8233.94]  um
[8233.94 --> 8235.94]  oh
[8236.50 --> 8238.82]  Hey, we've got a promotional thing for flow plane
[8240.02 --> 8242.58]  Yeah, look at that yeah plane promotion segment
[8243.14 --> 8248.34]  We have a video coming out on new year's eve called how well do you know your boss?
[8249.14 --> 8250.18]  oh featuring
[8250.82 --> 8254.98]  LLD which is I think what we're known as now. I always preferred dll
[8255.94 --> 8257.94]  dll is
[8257.94 --> 8259.94]  It makes more sense. Yeah
[8259.94 --> 8261.94]  dot dill right dan
[8261.94 --> 8263.94]  Do
[8266.02 --> 8272.82]  And taryn it's basically the newlywed game show but with boss employee relationships instead
[8273.46 --> 8278.74]  Oh, okay, please watch the following clip react and talk about what you found interesting about the shoot
[8278.74 --> 8282.26]  So you'll have to be subscribed on float plane or be a youtube member
[8282.74 --> 8287.54]  But please don't be a youtube member. It costs so much more and you all you get is the same stuff
[8287.54 --> 8290.66]  So just go to floatplane.com. Yeah, but if you must
[8291.22 --> 8294.90]  Not subscribe on floatplane.com because you already have your credit card and you know
[8294.90 --> 8301.38]  You tube system and you want to just do it there. I guess fine, but that works but go to floatplane. It's cheaper. It's awesome
[8301.70 --> 8303.70]  Anyway, we're supposed to watch this clip
[8303.70 --> 8307.54]  Or wait down. Are you gonna put the clip up for us or uh, you can play it if you want
[8307.54 --> 8313.30]  Let's see. I need sound from you. I think it'd be easier if you just did it. It would be better if you play it. Yeah, that is
[8314.18 --> 8318.34]  Very difficult. Oh, oh, but you played that other clip for us. That was prepped
[8318.34 --> 8321.62]  This should have also downloaded the video. Yeah, this should and then put it in
[8321.62 --> 8326.74]  I mean, I can download the video and I can just give it to you. Yeah, there is a button. I mean, I can do that on
[8328.10 --> 8330.98]  On the website. I mean, I've already downloaded it. I can well well
[8331.70 --> 8337.06]  You're gonna put it on this where you want it. I'm gonna put it on the server. Okay. All right. It's in z
[8337.94 --> 8339.06]  Linus
[8339.06 --> 8345.70]  Well, you guys do that if you have if you have feedback for the lab site, I'm posting the form in flow plane chat
[8345.70 --> 8348.10]  Hey, want to see what's in the test folder?
[8349.14 --> 8354.02]  No, no, let's play what's in the test folder. No big files
[8355.46 --> 8357.14]  What no, I want to see what's in the test folder
[8359.62 --> 8361.62]  Yeah, no, I want to see what's in the test folder
[8363.22 --> 8364.74]  I already screencapped it anyway, luke
[8365.46 --> 8367.62]  Ooh linus family sample photos
[8369.70 --> 8370.10]  Wallpaper
[8371.54 --> 8372.50]  This folder's empty
[8372.50 --> 8377.30]  The uh, the wallpaper in the useful software is way better
[8377.94 --> 8379.46]  Uh multi cam test
[8380.82 --> 8381.38]  Oh look
[8382.66 --> 8388.10]  Luke, it doesn't matter. There's nothing in here if this crashes the stream it's on you i'm importing it now stream files
[8388.10 --> 8390.10]  Or are you just showing?
[8390.34 --> 8393.30]  I don't know. It's just it's I don't know. It's interesting like what's this?
[8394.18 --> 8395.46]  I'm just i'm curious
[8396.10 --> 8398.98]  But i'm not allowed to be bad idea. I'm not allowed to be curious
[8398.98 --> 8400.42]  Yeah, actually
[8401.38 --> 8404.82]  Yeah, you're not allowed to be curious about random files that are all the server
[8404.82 --> 8406.42]  It's riley and the color's weird
[8408.34 --> 8410.98]  I don't know that seems that seems cool. Yeah
[8413.86 --> 8416.18]  Uh, okay, I can play this video now if you want
[8416.90 --> 8421.30]  Go for it. All right. He's so mad right now. Look at him. He's all mad. I am. I am. You mad bro?
[8421.30 --> 8423.30]  I am. It's just so dumb
[8426.34 --> 8428.98]  Okay, is it this button and fake
[8428.98 --> 8433.54]  A little bit redundant question for linus, but if linus had a million dollars, what would he spend it on?
[8434.18 --> 8435.78]  And you can't you can't do investment stuff
[8436.34 --> 8440.10]  Not investing. Yeah, because every time I asked this it was investment answers. That's boring
[8440.58 --> 8442.50]  Do you think are you confident you're going to get the same thing linus?
[8443.62 --> 8446.50]  No, no. All right, let's see what it is in three two one
[8448.02 --> 8448.90]  Higher
[8448.90 --> 8454.34]  A several? A serval? A serval? They cost like five grand. I have a million dollars
[8454.98 --> 8457.06]  I need something way more expensive than a serval
[8457.62 --> 8459.62]  Does anything to do with housing?
[8460.02 --> 8463.14]  Yeah, I want Jack's first tweet. That's that's why I don't buy my own
[8463.14 --> 8467.46]  They already have like everything they could birds are very simple. How do you spend a million dollars?
[8467.46 --> 8469.46]  I buy a cookie and then invest the rest
[8470.26 --> 8472.66]  No investment. Can I show my f***ing answer?
[8472.66 --> 8473.94]  If you don't know, you just want to. I don't know
[8473.94 --> 8476.02]  Yeah, you know what you just show you we're gonna break the game
[8478.90 --> 8484.34]  Oh my god, you spent ten minutes off just talking about this and now it's answering
[8485.62 --> 8487.06]  Oh my god, I'm like, please
[8487.06 --> 8488.50]  Give me an answer at this point
[8488.50 --> 8489.22]  I love it
[8489.22 --> 8490.18]  I was okay with me
[8491.54 --> 8492.26]  Mic drop
[8492.26 --> 8493.70]  Oh my god
[8494.34 --> 8494.74]  Why?
[8494.74 --> 8496.90]  You haven't been writing you didn't add to that
[8496.90 --> 8497.86]  I wrote that immediately
[8497.86 --> 8501.38]  So now we're getting to the traditional newlyweds questions
[8501.78 --> 8503.30]  I did have to save up to hire him
[8503.30 --> 8503.94]  Yeah
[8506.18 --> 8507.46]  To be clear, I'm yeah
[8507.46 --> 8508.02]  Anyway
[8509.86 --> 8510.82]  Richard thought you
[8510.82 --> 8511.46]  No, I'm good
[8511.46 --> 8511.94]  No, okay
[8511.94 --> 8519.86]  That was actually
[8519.86 --> 8521.22]  I had a great time
[8521.22 --> 8527.86]  It was the amount of times that I would hum and haw over something for an extremely long period of time and dan just wrote it down immediately was very funny
[8527.86 --> 8530.50]  Yeah, I definitely had fun with it
[8530.50 --> 8536.34]  Um, we've got a lot of great exclusives on float plan. They've been uploading a flipping
[8536.34 --> 8537.54]  Ton
[8537.54 --> 8538.50]  Oh, yeah, they've been killing it
[8538.50 --> 8539.22]  Of them lately
[8539.22 --> 8541.30]  Uh, here you can check this out
[8541.30 --> 8544.74]  We've got extras from the unboxing the giant tv video
[8544.74 --> 8548.66]  We've got another newlywed game with uh, nick and sarah and james and bell
[8549.22 --> 8554.26]  Behind the scenes water cooling the laptop for 30 bucks colton getting his float plane tattoo
[8554.90 --> 8556.90]  That's right. He did it
[8557.86 --> 8559.38]  Clearly already watched this one
[8559.38 --> 8561.78]  He's got so many company tattoos
[8561.78 --> 8562.90]  I know it's ridiculous
[8562.90 --> 8564.26]  Oh my goodness
[8564.26 --> 8567.38]  Hold on does he does he show off all the tattoos at any point?
[8567.38 --> 8571.54]  You gotta start spinning up just random companies just to like cover his leg with more logos
[8571.54 --> 8573.94]  I know so he goes around and shows people and like
[8574.50 --> 8575.70]  Yeah, that face says it
[8577.38 --> 8579.14]  Why would you do this?
[8579.14 --> 8580.34]  Well, I have to be supportive
[8582.10 --> 8582.74]  It's permanent
[8582.74 --> 8583.70]  Look at this face
[8587.70 --> 8588.34]  It's like ah
[8589.54 --> 8591.22]  Last night I watched the
[8591.22 --> 8593.14]  We tore apart the coal mine backpack
[8593.14 --> 8594.02]  Or we tore the coal
[8594.02 --> 8595.22]  Oof, dyslexia
[8595.22 --> 8597.14]  We tore the coal mine backpack apart
[8597.62 --> 8599.94]  I watched that video and it was really interesting
[8599.94 --> 8601.38]  Yeah, Tatiana did a great job
[8601.38 --> 8602.02]  It was cool
[8602.02 --> 8604.42]  She's never posted before but she was just
[8604.42 --> 8605.54]  She just jumped right in
[8605.54 --> 8606.58]  She's really knowledgeable
[8606.58 --> 8606.98]  So that's
[8606.98 --> 8607.46]  I was gonna say
[8607.46 --> 8610.26]  Passionate knowledgeable interested people talking about things is just
[8611.30 --> 8612.18]  Always helps
[8612.18 --> 8612.74]  Always good
[8612.74 --> 8615.70]  So she's our kind of materials person
[8615.70 --> 8618.98]  I guess would be the best way to describe Tatiana
[8620.42 --> 8622.26]  And so for her this is just like
[8623.38 --> 8625.22]  Because like I look at it and I'm like wow
[8625.22 --> 8625.86]  It lives
[8625.86 --> 8626.82]  That's amazing
[8626.82 --> 8629.06]  It must be fantastic and great
[8629.06 --> 8629.54]  Yeah
[8629.54 --> 8630.26]  And she's like well
[8630.26 --> 8631.78]  It could be improved in these various different ways
[8631.78 --> 8632.50]  It's like oh cool
[8632.50 --> 8632.74]  Yeah
[8632.74 --> 8634.42]  I really think about that
[8634.42 --> 8635.06]  Yeah, really cool
[8636.50 --> 8637.22]  All right anyway
[8637.22 --> 8639.78]  So now's a good time to subscribe to floatplane
[8639.78 --> 8642.50]  Go through the entire back catalog of exclusives
[8642.50 --> 8647.62]  Which is so much easier to browse now that you can separate everything out into sub channels
[8647.62 --> 8649.78]  So you can just see all exclusives
[8649.78 --> 8650.66]  There are so many
[8650.66 --> 8653.86]  Everything that you see here is from the last three months
[8653.86 --> 8656.98]  Everything that I scrolled through all of this blah blah blah blah
[8656.98 --> 8659.46]  And it goes back for years
[8659.46 --> 8661.06]  We're at six months of exclusives
[8661.06 --> 8662.42]  Ten months of exclusives
[8663.06 --> 8664.26]  A year of exclusives
[8664.26 --> 8665.94]  There's so much content you guys
[8665.94 --> 8667.06]  And there's tons of like
[8667.62 --> 8670.50]  A huge percentage of this stuff is just evergreen stuff
[8670.50 --> 8672.18]  Meeting different members of the team
[8672.18 --> 8672.90]  Yep
[8672.90 --> 8674.10]  Favorite video games
[8674.10 --> 8674.58]  Yeah
[8674.58 --> 8676.50]  What do you love and hate about building
[8678.34 --> 8679.22]  Random clips
[8679.22 --> 8680.58]  Extras from videos
[8681.30 --> 8683.70]  Yeah, really good good good stuff
[8683.70 --> 8685.06]  Oh man, scroll up a little bit
[8686.50 --> 8688.42]  FP exclusive extras
[8688.42 --> 8689.54]  Remember when we made
[8690.90 --> 8692.34]  Uh bottom right hand corner of the screen
[8693.70 --> 8694.34]  This?
[8694.34 --> 8694.90]  Down one
[8694.90 --> 8695.70]  Oh this one
[8696.90 --> 8698.18]  Yeah, we did this uh
[8698.18 --> 8700.10]  We did this weird ad for funk
[8700.10 --> 8702.02]  Uh here hold on
[8702.02 --> 8702.82]  Luke's uh
[8702.82 --> 8704.58]  Luke's acting career
[8705.22 --> 8705.86]  It's amazing
[8705.86 --> 8706.82]  It never took off
[8710.82 --> 8711.54]  Oh man
[8711.54 --> 8712.82]  Oh man that mouse
[8712.82 --> 8713.78]  Yeah
[8713.78 --> 8717.62]  It's funny because like there's stuff on the market that's not that dissimilar
[8717.62 --> 8718.50]  Yeah
[8720.90 --> 8721.22]  Um
[8722.02 --> 8723.70]  Unhappy felines company
[8725.54 --> 8727.62]  Hold on I think you were in here again weren't you
[8727.62 --> 8730.10]  I think it might be earlier
[8730.74 --> 8732.10]  Oh wait you put up a tiny hand
[8732.58 --> 8732.90]  Oh no
[8733.70 --> 8734.34]  Yeah, there it is
[8734.34 --> 8735.46]  Amazing
[8738.34 --> 8739.38]  Oh man
[8739.38 --> 8740.58]  Yeah, that was a whole
[8740.58 --> 8741.46]  That was a whole thing
[8741.46 --> 8742.02]  Oh, oh no
[8742.02 --> 8743.62]  Yeah, here's the other spot that you're in
[8744.18 --> 8745.54]  I thought this was actually pretty good
[8745.54 --> 8746.18]  It was like
[8746.82 --> 8747.54]  Bio-adhesive
[8747.54 --> 8750.18]  So it like burned my hand and I was supposed to fall back like that
[8751.06 --> 8751.86]  Oh, that was all right
[8755.30 --> 8755.70]  Anyway
[8756.26 --> 8756.82]  Uh, yeah
[8756.82 --> 8758.26]  So there's lots of good stuff in there
[8758.26 --> 8758.98]  I think this was
[8759.94 --> 8761.70]  When would that have been? 2013?
[8761.70 --> 8762.82]  When did portal 2 come out?
[8763.38 --> 8764.02]  I don't know 20
[8764.02 --> 8765.54]  No, not 2013
[8765.54 --> 8766.82]  Was that 2014?
[8766.82 --> 8768.42]  Good gravy, it might have been 2013
[8768.42 --> 8769.70]  It's 2013 or 14
[8769.70 --> 8770.42]  One of the two
[8770.42 --> 8773.62]  Yeah, portal had just came out 2011
[8773.62 --> 8773.86]  Yeah
[8773.86 --> 8775.70]  Um, so it was kind of top of mind
[8775.70 --> 8776.10]  Yeah
[8776.10 --> 8777.22]  So that scene where it's like
[8777.22 --> 8778.66]  Bio-adhesive surface all that kind of stuff
[8778.66 --> 8781.06]  I think portal was still very culturally relevant
[8781.06 --> 8781.30]  Yeah
[8781.30 --> 8782.74]  So there's some influences from there
[8782.74 --> 8783.70]  Oh, yeah, 100%
[8783.70 --> 8784.10]  Yeah
[8784.66 --> 8785.54]  Portal's super cool
[8786.66 --> 8787.22]  Yeah
[8787.22 --> 8787.78]  Oh
[8789.14 --> 8790.26]  Good stuff
[8791.14 --> 8792.66]  All right, what else are we supposed to be talking about?
[8795.22 --> 8796.50]  New Year's resolutions
[8797.30 --> 8798.10]  Source won
[8798.98 --> 8800.26]  Last year's video
[8801.38 --> 8801.94]  Interesting
[8803.30 --> 8804.50]  Last year
[8804.50 --> 8806.58]  We answered a merch message
[8806.58 --> 8810.58]  About what kind of LTT store products we wish we could make
[8810.58 --> 8811.62]  Highlights include
[8812.10 --> 8815.06]  Launching the LTT backpack and screwdriver before the end of the year
[8815.06 --> 8815.46]  Did it?
[8815.46 --> 8816.26]  Okay, very good
[8816.74 --> 8819.94]  A clenched to prone butt plug peripheral with haptic feedback
[8823.46 --> 8824.58]  Had a failure on that one
[8824.58 --> 8825.14]  Yeah, didn't do that
[8825.14 --> 8826.26]  Didn't get that one out
[8826.26 --> 8830.98]  A stiff bendable usb cable that holds the position it's bent into like a gorilla pod
[8831.46 --> 8831.78]  Okay
[8831.78 --> 8832.42]  Didn't do that
[8832.42 --> 8832.82]  No
[8832.82 --> 8835.22]  An automatic coin sorting piggy bank
[8836.50 --> 8837.06]  Didn't do that
[8837.06 --> 8837.94]  That's also okay
[8837.94 --> 8842.90]  A book by Yvonne discussing supporting a youtuber spouse slash roasting Linus
[8842.90 --> 8844.02]  I mean that's a matter of time
[8844.02 --> 8845.06]  That would have been fantastic
[8845.06 --> 8847.22]  And an on-demand greeting card printer
[8847.86 --> 8849.30]  The discussion question is
[8850.34 --> 8854.90]  What projects and products would you like to make in the coming year?
[8855.54 --> 8855.86]  Uh
[8855.86 --> 8857.14]  Wow
[8857.70 --> 8858.02]  Well
[8858.02 --> 8861.62]  Probably none of those things that we haven't made yet
[8861.62 --> 8862.50]  For starters
[8863.38 --> 8864.42]  Tall sizes for shirts
[8864.42 --> 8864.74]  Yes
[8864.74 --> 8865.86]  Yes
[8865.86 --> 8866.74]  Yes
[8866.74 --> 8867.22]  Yes
[8867.22 --> 8867.54]  Yes
[8867.54 --> 8867.94]  We'll do it
[8867.94 --> 8868.34]  We'll do it
[8868.34 --> 8868.58]  We'll do it
[8868.58 --> 8869.46]  Magnets released
[8869.46 --> 8870.10]  Oh yeah
[8870.10 --> 8871.70]  We'll get the arches out
[8871.70 --> 8872.34]  We're gonna have
[8873.14 --> 8874.66]  I have no idea if this is cooking
[8874.66 --> 8875.06]  Oh
[8875.06 --> 8876.18]  Something I would like
[8876.18 --> 8876.90]  I would love
[8877.62 --> 8878.74]  No pressure though I guess
[8878.74 --> 8879.14]  Sure
[8879.14 --> 8880.58]  Tell me about it in front of
[8880.58 --> 8880.90]  Like
[8880.90 --> 8881.62]  Is they like
[8881.62 --> 8882.18]  Holy crap
[8882.18 --> 8884.10]  Like 16, 17,000 people
[8884.10 --> 8884.58]  Go for it
[8884.58 --> 8886.26]  Not necessarily quality reduced
[8887.14 --> 8889.14]  But maybe feature reduced backpack
[8889.14 --> 8889.86]  Oh yeah
[8889.86 --> 8890.66]  That's already in the works
[8890.66 --> 8891.14]  Okay cool
[8891.14 --> 8891.30]  Yeah
[8891.30 --> 8892.34]  Because I just find like
[8893.54 --> 8895.38]  I like that it works perfectly for you
[8895.38 --> 8897.62]  I love that it works perfectly for a bunch of other people online
[8897.62 --> 8899.54]  I've seen tons of photos of people fully using it
[8899.54 --> 8900.02]  Yep
[8900.02 --> 8902.02]  I don't use that many of the sleeves and stuff
[8902.02 --> 8904.90]  And because the materials are like good
[8904.90 --> 8906.18]  They tend to be decently thick
[8906.18 --> 8906.66]  Yeah
[8906.66 --> 8908.82]  And it takes up a decent amount of the space of the backpack
[8908.82 --> 8909.22]  Yep
[8909.22 --> 8909.70]  And I could
[8909.70 --> 8911.62]  I could actually win back more space
[8911.62 --> 8914.50]  And actually gain usability by having slightly less features
[8914.58 --> 8915.22]  Um
[8915.22 --> 8915.86]  You might
[8915.86 --> 8917.14]  You might like the upcoming one
[8917.14 --> 8917.46]  Cool
[8917.46 --> 8918.02]  Yeah
[8918.02 --> 8920.02]  It's not going to be called small
[8920.02 --> 8921.30]  Because it's actually not that small
[8921.30 --> 8921.78]  Yeah
[8921.78 --> 8923.14]  Like I don't actually want it to
[8923.14 --> 8923.62]  Yeah
[8923.62 --> 8924.66]  It's more like light
[8924.66 --> 8925.38]  Yeah
[8925.38 --> 8926.18]  L-I-T-E
[8926.18 --> 8926.74]  Yeah
[8926.74 --> 8928.18]  It's a little smaller though
[8928.18 --> 8930.18]  And for your frame it might be small
[8930.18 --> 8930.94]  I don't know
[8930.94 --> 8932.50]  I like the size of the current backpack
[8932.50 --> 8933.22]  You'll have to try it
[8933.22 --> 8935.14]  I don't actually want it to be physically smaller
[8935.14 --> 8936.02]  But this is
[8936.02 --> 8937.46]  I'm now designing it specifically for me
[8937.46 --> 8937.54]  Yeah
[8937.54 --> 8938.98]  It sounds like you just want a hiking bag
[8938.98 --> 8941.38]  Because that's a thing that exists already
[8941.38 --> 8942.22]  Just so you know
[8942.22 --> 8943.30]  It does generally work pretty well
[8943.30 --> 8943.54]  Yeah
[8943.54 --> 8945.38]  Like maybe you should just buy a hiking backpack
[8945.38 --> 8945.80]  Yeah
[8945.80 --> 8947.36]  Like that's a thing right
[8947.36 --> 8948.24]  That old bag I had though
[8948.24 --> 8950.94]  Had like the exact amount of slots that I wanted everywhere
[8950.94 --> 8952.38]  Oh that Averke
[8952.38 --> 8952.76]  Yeah
[8952.76 --> 8953.72]  Yeah it was a good bag
[8953.72 --> 8954.08]  Yeah
[8954.08 --> 8955.66]  Averke Titan
[8955.66 --> 8956.56]  Yeah thank you
[8956.56 --> 8958.50]  I didn't want it
[8958.50 --> 8960.06]  I definitely did
[8960.06 --> 8960.44]  It was so
[8960.44 --> 8960.94]  It was so
[8960.94 --> 8961.70]  Too big for me
[8961.70 --> 8962.78]  A lot of use
[8962.78 --> 8963.70]  Tons of use
[8963.70 --> 8965.44]  It was so much too big for me
[8965.44 --> 8965.94]  Yeah
[8965.94 --> 8967.84]  LTT gym bag win
[8967.84 --> 8969.66]  I don't think we need that to be honest
[8971.38 --> 8973.12]  But I mean maybe
[8973.12 --> 8975.98]  Never say never
[8975.98 --> 8977.06]  Wow
[8977.06 --> 8979.64]  I just think like you could use your LTT backpack that way
[8979.64 --> 8981.74]  Man we've been killing it on Billy Billy lately
[8981.74 --> 8984.56]  Got another video that has like 600,000 views
[8984.56 --> 8986.30]  That's crazy
[8986.30 --> 8988.22]  That's crazy
[8988.22 --> 8989.54]  Someone at Flowplane Chat said
[8989.54 --> 8989.96]  I
[8989.96 --> 8990.32]  Or
[8990.32 --> 8992.62]  Shielo Cat
[8992.62 --> 8993.40]  Shielo
[8993.40 --> 8994.14]  I don't know how to say that
[8994.14 --> 8996.50]  I want a tri-fold Apple leather wallet
[8996.50 --> 8998.54]  So I can get it to match the Apple leather backpack
[8998.54 --> 9000.42]  I would buy immediately together
[9000.42 --> 9002.30]  Um
[9002.30 --> 9006.02]  I don't know if we're making like Apple leather
[9006.02 --> 9007.42]  A thing that the store does
[9007.42 --> 9008.78]  No I think that
[9008.78 --> 9010.16]  It depends on
[9010.16 --> 9011.42]  What we're trying to achieve
[9011.42 --> 9012.54]  We are working on a wallet
[9012.54 --> 9014.04]  But it will be cowhide leather
[9014.04 --> 9014.64]  Oh
[9014.64 --> 9015.24]  Yeah
[9015.24 --> 9017.74]  So for what we were trying to do with the backpack
[9017.74 --> 9018.74]  This was the best material
[9018.74 --> 9020.32]  But for what we're trying to do with a wallet
[9020.32 --> 9021.54]  I think that
[9021.54 --> 9023.94]  I think cowhide is probably still the best material
[9023.94 --> 9024.40]  It's thin
[9024.40 --> 9027.26]  And we didn't want the wallet to be really thick
[9027.26 --> 9028.98]  Before you fill it with all the money that
[9028.98 --> 9030.10]  You have
[9030.10 --> 9032.52]  From not buying a
[9032.52 --> 9032.86]  You know
[9032.86 --> 9033.54]  You know
[9033.54 --> 9035.04]  Luxury goods wallet
[9035.04 --> 9038.08]  Cause you're smart
[9038.08 --> 9038.92]  Yeah
[9038.92 --> 9039.72]  Uh
[9039.72 --> 9040.38]  What were we talking about
[9040.38 --> 9042.68]  Oh yeah
[9042.68 --> 9043.78]  You know what
[9043.78 --> 9044.16]  Honestly
[9044.16 --> 9044.86]  I don't
[9044.86 --> 9046.74]  I don't compile the list anymore
[9046.74 --> 9047.86]  So I
[9047.86 --> 9048.32]  Um
[9048.32 --> 9050.50]  I don't know
[9050.50 --> 9051.42]  What's on the list
[9051.42 --> 9053.58]  I still send the team random stuff
[9053.58 --> 9055.20]  The difference is just that
[9055.20 --> 9056.30]  I'm not the one
[9056.30 --> 9058.40]  Who maintains the list anymore
[9058.40 --> 9059.72]  So somebody else has it
[9059.72 --> 9060.96]  Like if I
[9060.96 --> 9061.48]  You know what
[9061.48 --> 9062.68]  If I just search for emails
[9062.68 --> 9063.72]  I've sent to Kyle
[9063.72 --> 9064.78]  This year
[9064.78 --> 9065.70]  Then
[9065.70 --> 9067.76]  Probably will find some stuff
[9067.76 --> 9069.84]  Kyle
[9069.84 --> 9071.84]  Kyle
[9071.84 --> 9072.78]  Another tool
[9072.78 --> 9074.48]  Oh
[9074.48 --> 9076.44]  We're gonna hopefully do a thermal pad
[9076.44 --> 9079.48]  Like with that cool PT
[9079.48 --> 9080.04]  Whatever
[9080.04 --> 9081.26]  Thermal pad stuff
[9081.26 --> 9082.00]  I think that's
[9082.00 --> 9082.88]  That's something
[9082.88 --> 9084.44]  Um
[9084.44 --> 9087.16]  Oh man
[9087.16 --> 9088.20]  Um
[9088.20 --> 9090.26]  No
[9090.26 --> 9091.04]  That's dumb
[9091.04 --> 9091.90]  Um
[9091.90 --> 9095.24]  Actually a pretty good idea
[9095.24 --> 9096.60]  Uh
[9096.60 --> 9097.90]  No
[9097.90 --> 9098.22]  I
[9098.22 --> 9098.76]  Hmm
[9098.76 --> 9100.76]  No
[9100.76 --> 9101.58]  I don't really
[9101.58 --> 9102.86]  I don't see anything guys
[9102.86 --> 9104.02]  We're definitely gonna launch
[9104.02 --> 9104.86]  The precision screwdriver
[9104.86 --> 9106.40]  We're gonna launch
[9106.40 --> 9107.04]  Hopefully
[9107.04 --> 9108.68]  Fixed shaft screwdrivers
[9108.68 --> 9109.94]  But there are some roadblocks
[9109.94 --> 9110.26]  To
[9110.26 --> 9111.82]  Hit the quality that we want
[9111.82 --> 9112.78]  While not being
[9112.78 --> 9113.68]  Saddled with
[9113.68 --> 9114.56]  Enormous
[9114.56 --> 9114.84]  Like
[9114.84 --> 9117.42]  40,000 unit per end
[9117.42 --> 9119.28]  Minimum order quantities
[9119.28 --> 9119.66]  So
[9119.66 --> 9120.28]  You know
[9120.28 --> 9121.60]  TBD on all of that
[9121.60 --> 9122.58]  Guys
[9122.58 --> 9123.86]  It was the crow bar hammer
[9123.86 --> 9124.96]  Not just crow hammer
[9124.96 --> 9125.82]  And also
[9125.82 --> 9126.20]  No
[9126.20 --> 9127.12]  Yeah
[9127.12 --> 9127.70]  That's probably
[9127.70 --> 9128.64]  That's probably not happening
[9128.64 --> 9129.80]  I think that ship has
[9129.80 --> 9132.46]  Absolutely sailed
[9132.46 --> 9133.34]  Um
[9133.34 --> 9135.78]  Warner Bros and Paramount
[9135.78 --> 9136.84]  Maybe getting together
[9136.84 --> 9139.28]  I talked about this man
[9139.28 --> 9140.88]  This is scary
[9140.88 --> 9142.28]  For the entertainment industry
[9142.28 --> 9143.28]  Like um
[9143.28 --> 9144.18]  I ended up
[9144.18 --> 9145.46]  I ended up being
[9145.46 --> 9147.80]  At least temporarily wrong
[9147.80 --> 9149.12]  When I said that
[9149.12 --> 9149.58]  The
[9149.58 --> 9150.12]  The
[9150.12 --> 9151.26]  The writers and the actors
[9151.26 --> 9152.08]  Were just
[9152.08 --> 9153.82]  Just not gonna get a deal
[9153.82 --> 9154.26]  Yeah
[9154.26 --> 9155.34]  They ended up getting it done
[9155.34 --> 9156.26]  And like
[9156.26 --> 9157.98]  Kudos
[9157.98 --> 9158.42]  Man
[9158.42 --> 9159.26]  That's awesome
[9159.26 --> 9162.06]  But this is what we're looking at now
[9162.06 --> 9163.14]  According to Axios
[9163.14 --> 9164.96]  The CEOs of Warner Brothers Discovery
[9164.96 --> 9166.02]  And Paramount Global
[9166.02 --> 9166.74]  Met this week
[9166.74 --> 9167.62]  For several hours
[9167.62 --> 9169.16]  To discuss a possible merger
[9169.16 --> 9170.98]  Warner Bros is currently valued
[9170.98 --> 9172.50]  At approximately 29 billion
[9172.50 --> 9173.80]  And Paramount Global
[9173.80 --> 9175.08]  Approximately 10 billion
[9175.08 --> 9177.20]  Warner Bros is cash positive
[9177.20 --> 9180.46]  But has 40 billion dollars in debt
[9180.46 --> 9181.98]  While Paramount Global
[9181.98 --> 9184.70]  Has 15 billion in debt
[9184.70 --> 9186.56]  And a negative cash flow
[9186.56 --> 9188.72]  If an acquisition were to take place
[9188.72 --> 9189.94]  Prior to April of this year
[9189.94 --> 9192.64]  Warner Bros would take a substantial tax penalty
[9192.64 --> 9193.98]  Due to a provision
[9193.98 --> 9196.60]  That allowed its merger with Discovery last year
[9196.60 --> 9200.08]  Beyond their combined film and television distribution and IP
[9200.08 --> 9202.64]  Any potential merger might lead to the consolidation
[9202.64 --> 9204.10]  Of CBS News and CNN
[9204.10 --> 9207.34]  Likewise a combination of their three streaming services
[9207.34 --> 9210.52]  Would allow them to better compete with rivals like Netflix
[9210.52 --> 9211.68]  But here's the problem
[9211.68 --> 9216.40]  Their whole business model is disintegrating
[9216.40 --> 9218.26]  In front of our very eyes
[9218.26 --> 9218.82]  With cable
[9218.82 --> 9219.86]  Excuse me
[9219.86 --> 9220.70]  With cord cutting
[9220.70 --> 9227.28]  With the transition
[9227.28 --> 9229.56]  That appears to be taking place
[9229.56 --> 9230.64]  Towards piracy
[9230.64 --> 9231.96]  Due to frustration
[9231.96 --> 9232.40]  I think
[9232.40 --> 9234.60]  With the endless mountain
[9234.60 --> 9235.60]  Of streaming services
[9235.60 --> 9237.16]  That are competing for our attention
[9237.16 --> 9237.74]  It's ridiculous
[9237.74 --> 9242.00]  There are some articles
[9242.00 --> 9243.18]  That I read about this
[9243.18 --> 9245.18]  That cited the increased cost
[9245.18 --> 9245.84]  Of production
[9245.84 --> 9247.08]  With the new deals
[9247.08 --> 9249.16]  As something that's putting pressure
[9249.16 --> 9250.00]  On these companies
[9250.00 --> 9250.38]  Like
[9250.38 --> 9252.96]  That was the issue
[9252.96 --> 9254.12]  That I talked about
[9254.12 --> 9255.44]  With that negotiation
[9255.44 --> 9256.26]  Where I kind of went
[9256.26 --> 9258.10]  Guys you're asking for more money
[9258.10 --> 9259.12]  But what money
[9259.12 --> 9260.90]  Paramount is bleeding
[9260.90 --> 9262.08]  Warner Bros is
[9262.08 --> 9263.44]  Okay cash flow positive
[9263.44 --> 9263.80]  But
[9263.80 --> 9266.44]  Has 40 billion dollars in debt
[9266.44 --> 9268.30]  That's not a sign of a healthy business
[9268.30 --> 9268.88]  Yeah
[9268.88 --> 9269.62]  Um
[9269.62 --> 9271.36]  It's scary
[9271.36 --> 9273.54]  Netflix is apparently still profitable
[9273.54 --> 9274.80]  So that's
[9274.80 --> 9275.52]  That's something
[9275.52 --> 9275.88]  They
[9275.88 --> 9276.68]  They have managed
[9276.68 --> 9277.70]  To weather the storm
[9277.70 --> 9278.96]  Of everyone and their dog
[9278.96 --> 9280.22]  Trying to be the new Netflix
[9280.22 --> 9281.18]  And they are still
[9281.18 --> 9282.32]  The Netflix
[9282.32 --> 9283.06]  They added
[9283.06 --> 9284.36]  More subscribers
[9284.36 --> 9285.22]  I think this last
[9285.22 --> 9286.04]  I want to say quarter
[9286.04 --> 9287.24]  I forget if it was quarter or month
[9287.24 --> 9288.90]  But this last reporting period
[9288.90 --> 9290.32]  Than they had at any time
[9290.32 --> 9291.84]  Prior to the bump
[9291.84 --> 9292.92]  That they got from COVID
[9292.92 --> 9293.68]  Interesting
[9293.68 --> 9294.78]  And this seems to be down
[9294.78 --> 9296.08]  To the crackdown
[9296.08 --> 9297.16]  On subscription sharing
[9297.16 --> 9297.84]  So Netflix
[9297.84 --> 9299.68]  Is managing to make it work
[9299.68 --> 9300.92]  But as far as I can tell
[9300.92 --> 9301.92]  Pretty much
[9301.92 --> 9303.04]  Everyone else
[9303.04 --> 9303.84]  Is just
[9303.84 --> 9305.64]  Floundering
[9305.64 --> 9306.88]  With absolutely
[9306.88 --> 9308.74]  No idea
[9308.74 --> 9309.96]  How to
[9309.96 --> 9311.66]  Create original content
[9311.66 --> 9312.84]  That is
[9312.84 --> 9314.36]  Compelling enough
[9314.36 --> 9315.34]  To drive people
[9315.34 --> 9316.22]  To subscribe
[9316.22 --> 9316.90]  And it's
[9316.90 --> 9318.18]  It's kind of
[9318.18 --> 9319.02]  It's kind of scary
[9319.02 --> 9321.90]  Because I like movies
[9321.90 --> 9323.38]  You know
[9323.38 --> 9325.44]  I kind of want there to be
[9325.44 --> 9326.62]  Movies
[9326.62 --> 9327.82]  And TV
[9327.82 --> 9329.32]  And it just feels like
[9329.32 --> 9330.48]  We're on a collision course
[9330.48 --> 9331.86]  For the whole model
[9331.86 --> 9333.86]  Just not being feasible anymore
[9333.86 --> 9341.84]  Yeah
[9341.84 --> 9343.54]  I'm sitting here thinking
[9343.54 --> 9344.62]  Like I wonder how people
[9344.62 --> 9345.32]  Would react
[9345.32 --> 9348.02]  If there was
[9348.02 --> 9352.10]  A legitimate way
[9352.10 --> 9352.82]  Of selling
[9352.82 --> 9354.02]  Buy and own forever
[9354.02 --> 9357.04]  That
[9357.04 --> 9357.84]  That wasn't
[9357.84 --> 9358.80]  Like giving people
[9358.80 --> 9359.62]  Physical discs
[9359.62 --> 9360.52]  In physical stores
[9360.52 --> 9361.02]  That they don't want
[9361.02 --> 9361.58]  To drive to
[9361.58 --> 9363.78]  But
[9363.78 --> 9364.64]  I mean
[9364.64 --> 9365.18]  I think that's
[9365.18 --> 9365.64]  More or less
[9365.64 --> 9366.20]  Been tried
[9366.20 --> 9367.56]  Well yeah
[9367.56 --> 9368.20]  I think people
[9368.20 --> 9369.10]  As much as people
[9369.10 --> 9369.82]  Will scream about it
[9369.82 --> 9370.52]  Myself included
[9370.52 --> 9371.32]  No one's
[9371.32 --> 9372.20]  Other than
[9372.20 --> 9374.36]  Dozens of us
[9374.36 --> 9374.92]  No one's going to
[9374.92 --> 9375.78]  Do anything about it
[9375.78 --> 9377.06]  So like
[9377.06 --> 9379.04]  Yeah it's tough
[9379.04 --> 9380.32]  The people will burn
[9380.32 --> 9382.56]  Everything they can
[9382.56 --> 9385.92]  RCM024 says
[9385.92 --> 9386.50]  I think Disney
[9386.50 --> 9387.64]  Is still going strong too
[9387.64 --> 9388.72]  That's a big
[9388.72 --> 9389.32]  Negatory
[9389.32 --> 9390.56]  Disney plus
[9390.56 --> 9390.96]  Has
[9390.96 --> 9392.42]  Basically led to
[9392.42 --> 9392.88]  Bob
[9392.88 --> 9393.52]  Chapek
[9393.52 --> 9394.98]  Being
[9394.98 --> 9396.14]  Pushed out of Disney
[9396.14 --> 9398.28]  It was a disaster
[9398.28 --> 9399.60]  They've lost a ton
[9399.60 --> 9400.30]  Of money on it
[9400.30 --> 9402.62]  No very bad
[9402.62 --> 9404.74]  State Killer says
[9404.74 --> 9405.40]  I don't think the
[9405.40 --> 9406.08]  Writers and actors
[9406.08 --> 9406.60]  Are at fault
[9406.60 --> 9407.12]  That every movie
[9407.12 --> 9407.82]  Costs a gazillion
[9407.82 --> 9408.26]  Dollars now
[9408.26 --> 9409.26]  No not at all
[9409.26 --> 9410.30]  That's not what he
[9410.30 --> 9410.62]  Was saying
[9410.62 --> 9411.56]  But what I was
[9411.56 --> 9412.60]  Saying was that
[9412.60 --> 9413.34]  They're asking for
[9413.34 --> 9413.82]  More money
[9413.82 --> 9415.30]  And what I was
[9415.30 --> 9415.80]  Saying was
[9415.80 --> 9417.02]  What money
[9417.02 --> 9417.50]  Yeah
[9417.50 --> 9420.82]  These services
[9420.82 --> 9421.84]  Are not profitable
[9421.84 --> 9422.52]  These companies
[9422.52 --> 9423.86]  Are struggling
[9423.86 --> 9424.74]  To figure out
[9424.74 --> 9425.52]  A way to
[9425.52 --> 9426.70]  Run these
[9426.70 --> 9427.24]  Productions
[9427.24 --> 9427.94]  Profitably
[9427.94 --> 9429.16]  And no
[9429.16 --> 9429.92]  That's not
[9429.92 --> 9431.04]  The actor's fault
[9431.04 --> 9431.84]  Certainly not
[9431.84 --> 9432.88]  But it means
[9432.88 --> 9434.40]  That the money
[9434.40 --> 9435.10]  They're asking for
[9435.10 --> 9436.08]  Just isn't there
[9436.08 --> 9437.66]  So that's a problem
[9437.66 --> 9438.38]  Right
[9438.38 --> 9438.96]  Like when
[9438.96 --> 9440.02]  Like I can
[9440.02 --> 9440.66]  Absolutely
[9440.66 --> 9442.56]  See you know
[9442.56 --> 9443.46]  An Amazon driver
[9443.46 --> 9443.94]  Going well
[9443.94 --> 9444.66]  Amazon's posting
[9444.66 --> 9445.34]  Record profits
[9445.34 --> 9446.18]  Quarter after quarter
[9446.18 --> 9447.56]  Why am I
[9447.56 --> 9448.56]  Why am I
[9448.56 --> 9449.58]  Struggling this way
[9449.58 --> 9451.38]  100%
[9451.38 --> 9452.18]  There's money there
[9452.18 --> 9453.42]  So they should be
[9453.42 --> 9454.08]  Getting some of it
[9454.08 --> 9454.74]  But if there is
[9454.74 --> 9455.84]  No money
[9455.84 --> 9456.70]  Then that's
[9456.70 --> 9457.88]  A fundamental problem
[9457.88 --> 9458.66]  That's something
[9458.66 --> 9459.40]  That everyone needs
[9459.40 --> 9460.16]  To come to the table
[9460.16 --> 9460.98]  And try and solve
[9460.98 --> 9463.76]  I don't know
[9463.76 --> 9464.02]  I'm
[9464.02 --> 9465.30]  I'm
[9465.30 --> 9466.12]  I'm an outsider
[9466.12 --> 9466.58]  Here
[9466.58 --> 9467.34]  Like I'm
[9467.34 --> 9468.38]  Sort of
[9468.38 --> 9469.70]  In the entertainment
[9469.70 --> 9470.68]  Industry
[9470.68 --> 9471.54]  Like kind of
[9471.54 --> 9472.40]  Like we make content
[9472.40 --> 9473.10]  We make videos
[9473.10 --> 9473.80]  And you guys
[9473.80 --> 9474.62]  Watch them hopefully
[9474.62 --> 9476.14]  And like that's great
[9476.14 --> 9478.30]  And a lot of the same
[9478.30 --> 9479.02]  Pressures on that
[9479.02 --> 9480.54]  Industry exist on us
[9480.54 --> 9480.78]  You know
[9480.78 --> 9481.90]  Advertisers are
[9481.90 --> 9482.78]  Pulling out
[9482.78 --> 9484.00]  En masse
[9484.00 --> 9484.58]  Like the
[9484.58 --> 9485.76]  Advertising dollars
[9485.76 --> 9486.82]  Are drying up
[9486.82 --> 9487.70]  And you know
[9487.70 --> 9488.40]  We can see
[9488.40 --> 9489.06]  That it's tough
[9489.06 --> 9489.56]  Out there
[9489.56 --> 9490.30]  Right
[9490.30 --> 9490.92]  Like we're
[9490.92 --> 9492.04]  We're okay
[9492.04 --> 9492.72]  Don't worry
[9492.72 --> 9493.50]  You know
[9493.50 --> 9493.88]  We're good
[9493.88 --> 9494.56]  We're gonna keep
[9494.56 --> 9495.30]  Powering through
[9495.30 --> 9495.66]  Everything
[9495.66 --> 9496.82]  And that's all
[9496.82 --> 9497.86]  That's all like cool
[9497.86 --> 9499.12]  You know
[9499.12 --> 9499.60]  Fortunately
[9499.60 --> 9500.36]  We are
[9500.36 --> 9501.60]  We're built leaner
[9501.60 --> 9501.84]  Right
[9501.84 --> 9502.66]  Like our productions
[9502.66 --> 9503.84]  Don't cost
[9503.84 --> 9504.48]  That much
[9504.48 --> 9505.62]  And they aren't
[9505.62 --> 9506.18]  Underwater
[9506.18 --> 9508.24]  But we definitely
[9508.24 --> 9509.58]  See the same
[9509.58 --> 9510.04]  Pressures
[9510.04 --> 9510.78]  We're aware
[9510.78 --> 9511.22]  Of them
[9511.22 --> 9511.86]  That's what I'm
[9511.86 --> 9512.44]  Trying to say
[9512.44 --> 9515.32]  Is YouTube
[9515.32 --> 9515.72]  Profitable
[9515.72 --> 9516.34]  I don't think
[9516.34 --> 9517.16]  Anybody knows
[9517.16 --> 9518.42]  It's a good
[9518.42 --> 9518.88]  Question
[9518.88 --> 9523.40]  Yeah
[9523.40 --> 9524.62]  I'm not sure
[9524.62 --> 9525.28]  If anyone
[9525.28 --> 9525.74]  Knows
[9525.74 --> 9526.24]  If YouTube
[9526.24 --> 9526.74]  Is just
[9526.74 --> 9527.28]  Like sort of
[9527.28 --> 9527.78]  A giant
[9527.78 --> 9528.62]  Cash sink
[9528.62 --> 9531.38]  Data funnel
[9531.38 --> 9533.06]  Or if it is
[9533.06 --> 9533.68]  A legitimately
[9533.68 --> 9534.66]  Profitable business
[9534.66 --> 9534.88]  Now
[9534.88 --> 9535.50]  They've certainly
[9535.50 --> 9536.50]  Made steps
[9536.50 --> 9537.38]  That seem like
[9537.38 --> 9537.86]  They're trying
[9537.86 --> 9538.30]  To make it
[9538.30 --> 9538.76]  Profitable
[9538.76 --> 9540.04]  Increasing the
[9540.04 --> 9540.78]  Cost of premium
[9540.78 --> 9541.60]  Pushing premium
[9541.60 --> 9542.26]  Really hard
[9542.26 --> 9543.70]  You know
[9543.70 --> 9544.10]  Making it
[9544.10 --> 9544.48]  So you can
[9544.48 --> 9545.12]  Rent movies
[9545.12 --> 9546.26]  And TV shows
[9546.26 --> 9547.08]  Through YouTube
[9547.08 --> 9547.82]  There's
[9547.82 --> 9549.10]  Excuse me
[9549.10 --> 9549.56]  There's lots
[9549.56 --> 9550.24]  That they've done
[9550.24 --> 9550.60]  You know
[9550.60 --> 9550.88]  And buy
[9550.88 --> 9551.38]  I believe
[9551.38 --> 9552.18]  Lowering
[9552.18 --> 9553.24]  Yeah
[9553.24 --> 9553.68]  Right
[9553.68 --> 9555.06]  Lowering default

[9563.20 --> 9563.44]  Think
[9563.44 --> 9563.98]  Anyone
[9563.98 --> 9564.76]  Outside of

[9581.12 --> 9581.38]  Share

[9875.26 --> 9875.54]  Why
[9875.54 --> 9875.74]  This
[9875.74 --> 9875.94]  Did
[9875.94 --> 9876.36]  Actually
[9876.36 --> 9876.84]  Happen
[9876.84 --> 9877.06]  And
[9877.06 --> 9877.64]  What
[9877.64 --> 9877.82]  Not
[9877.82 --> 9878.28]  Sure
[9878.28 --> 9878.80]  So
[9878.80 --> 9879.18]  It's
[9879.18 --> 9879.46]  Enough
[9879.46 --> 9879.90]  To
[9879.90 --> 9880.24]  Be
[9880.24 --> 9880.90]  Inaccurate
[9880.90 --> 9881.32]  Enough
[9881.32 --> 9881.88]  To
[9881.88 --> 9882.08]  Make
[9882.08 --> 9882.28]  You
[9882.28 --> 9882.52]  Want
[9882.52 --> 9882.68]  To
[9882.68 --> 9882.94]  Find
[9882.94 --> 9883.18]  Out
[9883.18 --> 9883.42]  What
[9883.42 --> 9883.62]  Did
[9883.62 --> 9884.00]  Happen
[9884.00 --> 9884.92]  I
[9884.92 --> 9885.16]  Guess
[9885.16 --> 9885.46]  That's
[9885.46 --> 9885.74]  Cool
[9885.74 --> 9887.14]  Um
[9887.14 --> 9887.50]  The
[9887.50 --> 9887.78]  First
[9887.78 --> 9888.02]  Third

[9888.14 --> 9888.24]  The
[9888.24 --> 9888.44]  Movie
[9888.44 --> 9888.66]  Is
[9888.66 --> 9889.76]  Extremely
[9889.76 --> 9890.16]  Slow
[9890.16 --> 9890.88]  I
[9890.88 --> 9891.04]  Could
[9891.04 --> 9891.26]  Tell
[9891.26 --> 9891.44]  What
[9891.44 --> 9891.54]  They
[9891.54 --> 9891.66]  Were
[9891.66 --> 9891.90]  Trying
[9891.90 --> 9892.00]  To
[9892.00 --> 9892.22]  Do
[9892.22 --> 9892.52]  With
[9892.52 --> 9892.84]  The
[9892.84 --> 9893.30]  Tractor

[9894.32 --> 9894.84]  With
[9894.84 --> 9895.34]  Bill
[9895.34 --> 9895.70]  Gates
[9895.70 --> 9895.86]  That
[9895.86 --> 9895.96]  Was
[9895.96 --> 9896.06]  A
[9896.06 --> 9896.24]  Thing
[9896.24 --> 9896.46]  Though
[9896.46 --> 9896.70]  I
[9896.70 --> 9896.90]  Know
[9896.90 --> 9897.28]  Yeah
[9897.28 --> 9897.64]  But
[9897.64 --> 9897.78]  It
[9897.78 --> 9898.50]  Wasn't
[9898.50 --> 9899.06]  Exciting
[9899.06 --> 9899.76]  To
[9899.76 --> 9900.18]  Watch
[9900.18 --> 9900.60]  Like
[9900.60 --> 9900.70]  It
[9900.70 --> 9901.04]  Wasn't
[9901.04 --> 9901.54]  Very
[9901.54 --> 9902.28]  Exhilarating

[10253.40 --> 10253.82]  I
[10253.82 --> 10253.98]  Think
[10253.98 --> 10254.14]  We're

[10443.72 --> 10443.78]  I
[10443.78 --> 10444.02]  Do
[10444.02 --> 10445.96]  And
[10445.96 --> 10446.18]  Then
[10446.18 --> 10446.68]  Always
[10446.68 --> 10447.64]  Everyone
[10447.64 --> 10448.04]  Just
[10448.04 --> 10448.34]  Landing
[10448.34 --> 10448.52]  On
[10448.52 --> 10448.66]  The
[10448.66 --> 10448.92]  Same
[10448.92 --> 10449.24]  Thing
[10449.24 --> 10449.56]  Which
[10449.56 --> 10449.68]  Is
[10449.68 --> 10449.96]  Just
[10449.96 --> 10450.44]  I
[10450.44 --> 10450.58]  Don't
[10450.58 --> 10450.72]  Know
[10450.72 --> 10451.04]  Make
[10451.04 --> 10451.32]  Stuff
[10451.32 --> 10451.48]  A
[10451.48 --> 10451.72]  Lot
[10451.72 --> 10454.00]  It's
[10454.00 --> 10454.24]  Like
[10454.24 --> 10454.56]  Make
[10454.56 --> 10454.92]  A lot
[10454.92 --> 10455.04]  Of
[10455.04 --> 10455.32]  Dog
[10455.32 --> 10455.90]  Yeah
[10455.90 --> 10456.56]  And
[10456.56 --> 10456.90]  Then
[10457.10 --> 10457.98]  Read
[10457.98 --> 10458.14]  The
[10458.14 --> 10458.60]  Feedback
[10458.60 --> 10458.96]  Watch
[10458.96 --> 10459.12]  It
[10459.12 --> 10459.72]  Yourself
[10459.72 --> 10460.64]  Understand
[10460.64 --> 10461.40]  Internally
[10461.40 --> 10461.64]  Why
[10461.64 --> 10461.82]  You
[10461.82 --> 10462.06]  Don't
[10462.06 --> 10462.26]  Like
[10462.26 --> 10462.46]  The
[10462.46 --> 10462.72]  Thing
[10462.72 --> 10464.12]  Understand
[10464.12 --> 10464.84]  Externally
[10464.84 --> 10465.04]  Why
[10465.04 --> 10465.24]  Other
[10465.24 --> 10465.46]  People
[10465.46 --> 10465.70]  Don't
[10465.70 --> 10465.90]  Like
[10465.90 --> 10466.08]  The
[10466.08 --> 10466.32]  Thing
[10466.32 --> 10467.02]  Make
[10467.02 --> 10467.16]  It
[10467.16 --> 10467.26]  A
[10467.26 --> 10467.38]  Little
[10467.38 --> 10467.58]  Bit
[10467.58 --> 10467.86]  Better
[10467.86 --> 10468.80]  Do
[10468.80 --> 10468.96]  It
[10468.96 --> 10469.22]  Again
[10469.22 --> 10469.56]  Craft
[10469.56 --> 10469.84]  That
[10469.84 --> 10470.10]  Dog
[10470.10 --> 10472.74]  Sculpture
[10472.74 --> 10473.02]  Yeah
[10473.02 --> 10474.34]  Eventually
[10474.34 --> 10474.68]  If
[10474.68 --> 10474.80]  You
[10487.10 --> 10489.02]  And
[10489.02 --> 10490.18]  Oh
[10490.18 --> 10491.28]  Oh
[10491.28 --> 10491.80]  Fuck
[10491.80 --> 10492.40]  I
[10492.40 --> 10492.56]  I'm
[10492.56 --> 10492.72]  Not
[10492.72 --> 10493.02]  Happy
[10493.02 --> 10493.26]  About
[10493.26 --> 10493.94]  That
[10493.94 --> 10495.38]  That
[10495.38 --> 10495.58]  Kind
[10495.58 --> 10495.68]  Of
[10495.68 --> 10495.84]  Sucks
[10495.84 --> 10496.10]  We'll
[10496.10 --> 10496.26]  Find
[10496.26 --> 10496.38]  A
[10496.38 --> 10496.50]  Use
[10496.50 --> 10496.66]  For
[10496.66 --> 10496.76]  It
[10496.76 --> 10496.88]  Though
[10496.88 --> 10497.20]  Badminton
[10497.20 --> 10497.44]  Center
[10497.44 --> 10497.66]  Sounds
[10497.66 --> 10497.90]  Pretty
[10497.90 --> 10498.08]  Cool
[10498.08 --> 10498.26]  Yeah
[10498.26 --> 10498.34]  We'll
[10498.34 --> 10498.58]  Figure
[10498.58 --> 10498.74]  It
[10498.74 --> 10499.16]  Out
[10499.16 --> 10507.14]  Hello, WAN.exy. I just switched from an iPhone to Pixel, and it's been a bit of a learning curve so far.
[10507.58 --> 10511.96]  Luke, how has your experience with the Pixel been, and are there any tips for a noob like me?
[10512.42 --> 10516.52]  Yes, actually. My experience has been surprisingly good.
[10517.06 --> 10522.40]  Usually, over the last, I think, three different versions, four different versions of getting a Pixel,
[10523.40 --> 10527.34]  I've ran into some pretty major bugs.
[10527.34 --> 10531.44]  And this time around, none, which has been cool.
[10532.14 --> 10538.86]  I kind of wish I got the non-pro, just because it's a very large phone.
[10540.50 --> 10545.44]  And I got the case for it, which I'm happy about, because the camera bump is enormous,
[10545.78 --> 10548.70]  to the point where it's actually really annoying and problematic.
[10549.58 --> 10553.74]  But the case is really grippy, that's nice, but that makes sure that it pulls everything out of my pocket.
[10553.74 --> 10556.06]  When I pull it out of my pocket, it's very large when it's in my pocket.
[10556.06 --> 10560.52]  It's just, it's a little bit cumbersome, and for someone that's not really into their phone,
[10560.86 --> 10562.34]  that's not a huge benefit to me.
[10563.26 --> 10567.00]  I, meanwhile, have been having a very buggy experience with the Fairphone.
[10567.22 --> 10569.04]  This is me trying to edit a doc.
[10569.48 --> 10570.30]  Oh, no.
[10570.30 --> 10578.70]  And just every five seconds, I get docs is not responding, and I have to dismiss the thing.
[10579.18 --> 10581.18]  I have all kinds of issues with audio.
[10581.74 --> 10582.88]  I wonder, you know what?
[10582.98 --> 10583.22]  Here.
[10583.80 --> 10586.20]  I haven't always been capturing it.
[10586.30 --> 10589.94]  I've only recently started just carrying my iPhone in my other pocket,
[10589.94 --> 10593.34]  so that I can just capture this nonsense.
[10595.26 --> 10600.12]  But I've had this audio issue where the earpiece won't work on calls.
[10600.22 --> 10601.04]  I'll have to use speaker.
[10601.46 --> 10603.24]  And then the speaker won't work.
[10605.82 --> 10607.36]  Like when playing back media.
[10607.70 --> 10609.48]  So here, here's the WAN show.
[10610.48 --> 10611.14]  Oh, good.
[10611.28 --> 10612.50]  My speaker's working now.
[10612.72 --> 10613.34]  Okay, cool.
[10613.52 --> 10613.90]  Well, that's...
[10613.90 --> 10614.72]  Of course, because you're trying to show someone how it works.
[10614.72 --> 10615.32]  Yeah, that's new.
[10616.78 --> 10620.92]  But yeah, so the one thing that bugged me a lot when I first got it
[10620.92 --> 10623.16]  was my previous Pixel 4a 5G.
[10623.56 --> 10626.98]  The Google logo on the back, I could swipe down on it.
[10627.44 --> 10628.94]  So yes, it was the fingerprint reader.
[10629.16 --> 10630.46]  I don't really know which...
[10630.46 --> 10632.54]  I don't know if I care if the fingerprint reader's on the back
[10632.54 --> 10634.06]  or if it's on the screen, whatever.
[10634.60 --> 10637.72]  The thing that I do care about is being able to pull down the system tray
[10637.72 --> 10639.32]  by swiping down like this.
[10639.42 --> 10642.34]  It worked 100% of the time, and it was fantastic.
[10642.34 --> 10645.00]  A lot of people say it doesn't really matter
[10645.00 --> 10648.84]  because you can just pull down from the lower part of your screen
[10648.84 --> 10649.64]  so you don't have to move your hand.
[10649.90 --> 10650.86]  Yeah, what if you're in an app?
[10651.38 --> 10652.34]  Now it doesn't work.
[10652.46 --> 10655.54]  Like I actually want to be able to pull down the top tray
[10655.54 --> 10658.06]  without adjusting my hand and reaching all the way up
[10658.06 --> 10660.18]  no matter what scenario I'm in.
[10660.66 --> 10662.02]  So there's a feature.
[10662.18 --> 10663.02]  You have to go turn it on.
[10663.08 --> 10663.78]  I don't remember what it's under.
[10663.88 --> 10664.52]  You can Google it.
[10664.76 --> 10666.20]  Where you tap on the back.
[10666.52 --> 10667.20]  Yeah, it just didn't work.
[10667.44 --> 10668.00]  Tap, tap, tap.
[10668.30 --> 10668.80]  Tap, tap.
[10670.06 --> 10670.76]  Light taps.
[10671.34 --> 10672.02]  Hard taps.
[10672.72 --> 10673.46]  Multiple taps.
[10673.62 --> 10673.98]  There we go.
[10674.02 --> 10674.44]  I got it.
[10674.84 --> 10676.60]  That's my problem with it so far.
[10676.76 --> 10677.82]  You should enable that.
[10678.64 --> 10683.46]  It makes it a lot better, but it is trash compared to what was on the 4a5G.
[10683.66 --> 10684.70]  It is garbage.
[10685.10 --> 10686.28]  No one will convince me otherwise.
[10686.88 --> 10689.74]  It's better than nothing because I can make it happen
[10689.74 --> 10692.08]  by like just spamming the tap on the back.
[10692.28 --> 10693.94]  But it's not very good.
[10693.94 --> 10699.98]  And just having a touch thing that you can swipe down on was significantly better.
[10700.08 --> 10701.78]  The tap system is a lot worse.
[10702.12 --> 10704.40]  But I'm happy that it's there versus nothing.
[10704.64 --> 10707.84]  And other than that, the phone has no issues.
[10708.80 --> 10713.18]  It's been quite good in the sense that I don't have to complain.
[10713.18 --> 10724.84]  I just heard from Douglas Stevens.
[10725.06 --> 10726.14]  I don't know if you remember him.
[10726.20 --> 10727.24]  He came by DMS?
[10727.84 --> 10727.98]  Yeah.
[10728.06 --> 10728.24]  Yeah.
[10728.24 --> 10728.64]  Yeah.
[10728.64 --> 10728.88]  Okay.
[10728.88 --> 10735.66]  And he pointed me at the other version of this camera that even not on sale is $2,000.
[10735.86 --> 10740.54]  And it apparently has a rebate right now to extend your one-year warranty to three years for free.
[10741.24 --> 10743.98]  It uses Micro Four Thirds, Dan.
[10744.20 --> 10746.82]  So it should have deeper depth of field.
[10747.24 --> 10747.44]  Yep.
[10747.64 --> 10748.96]  And I believe...
[10748.96 --> 10750.62]  I've looked at this one before.
[10751.16 --> 10755.42]  I believe it has the same Ethernet port.
[10755.56 --> 10756.08]  Yes, it does.
[10756.08 --> 10758.30]  Is that very similar to the GH1?
[10758.38 --> 10760.08]  Because I ran GH1s for years.
[10760.52 --> 10762.76]  So this must be like a box GH1?
[10763.72 --> 10764.02]  Maybe?
[10764.36 --> 10765.12]  I don't know.
[10765.22 --> 10766.30]  I don't know how they do their naming.
[10766.74 --> 10767.38]  What is it?
[10767.40 --> 10768.24]  The BGH1.
[10768.34 --> 10769.46]  I'll put that on my list as well.
[10769.94 --> 10770.72]  And there are two grand.
[10771.80 --> 10772.20]  Yeah.
[10772.30 --> 10778.20]  So that would be 28K instead of 35K, which is $7,000 difference.
[10778.32 --> 10781.42]  Hey, guess what I just paid for?
[10783.28 --> 10784.90]  A useless projector screen.
[10786.08 --> 10786.48]  Nice.
[10787.28 --> 10787.68]  Nice.
[10790.94 --> 10792.48]  The savings are immeasurable.
[10792.70 --> 10793.08]  Yeah.
[10793.70 --> 10794.70]  And my day is ruined.
[10795.20 --> 10795.60]  Okay.
[10795.74 --> 10797.08]  So what else we got?
[10797.58 --> 10798.80]  Dan, any more merch messages?
[10798.98 --> 10799.18]  Oh, yeah.
[10799.24 --> 10799.74]  We've got quite a few.
[10799.80 --> 10800.94]  Yeah, if you guys want to go through potential.
[10801.82 --> 10803.94]  Hello from the Upside Down Land.
[10803.94 --> 10804.84]  Curious.
[10804.92 --> 10810.28]  If you didn't use your home server setup for LTT videos, would you have done it as Overkill?
[10810.52 --> 10811.94]  For example, the LAN PCs.
[10811.94 --> 10817.46]  I think he would have.
[10817.92 --> 10819.04]  I'll answer for him.
[10819.16 --> 10819.42]  Good.
[10819.74 --> 10819.98]  Yep.
[10820.48 --> 10820.80]  Excellent.
[10821.18 --> 10822.74]  Because it's like a showcase.
[10823.08 --> 10823.78]  I think you would have.
[10823.84 --> 10827.28]  If I didn't use it for LTT videos.
[10827.28 --> 10829.64]  I think you would have found something else to use it for.
[10830.34 --> 10837.96]  I think you would have executed on your everyone having synchronized backup things or something.
[10838.18 --> 10840.10]  I think you would have found some way to make it make sense.
[10840.18 --> 10840.56]  I don't know.
[10840.56 --> 10841.00]  Okay.
[10841.14 --> 10844.04]  I would have rackified mine and Yvonne's machines.
[10844.20 --> 10845.70]  I would have put them in a different room.
[10846.20 --> 10847.42]  How would I have put them in a rack?
[10847.52 --> 10849.04]  I wouldn't have designed my own case.
[10849.32 --> 10850.06]  That's for sure.
[10850.48 --> 10855.34]  I wouldn't have tried to go 1U and like water cooled everything for the kids' machines.
[10856.02 --> 10864.38]  I think what I'd probably be using is the simple radiator inside, radiator outside heat exchanger system that we did for like a fraction of the price.
[10864.38 --> 10870.74]  Like I would probably be doing the, okay, yeah, to your point, the jankier, cheaper version of everything that I'm doing now.
[10871.64 --> 10880.12]  I don't think I would have used Thunderbolt, optical Thunderbolt for, I think I would have just put the computer closer, like just on the other side of a wall.
[10880.24 --> 10881.24]  Like, okay, for upstairs.
[10881.52 --> 10881.88]  Here, okay.
[10882.34 --> 10883.44]  I know how I would have done it.
[10883.48 --> 10884.76]  Oh, this would be kind of a cool video.
[10885.44 --> 10887.08]  The cheap way to do what I do.
[10887.50 --> 10888.32]  Like there's the title.
[10888.32 --> 10894.32]  So I know that you can get ceiling mounted, like under desk mounts for cases.
[10894.90 --> 10904.02]  So what you could do is if you had a basement, you could just put your computer on the ceiling instead of on the underside of a desk.
[10904.14 --> 10908.74]  You could put it on the ceiling underneath you and then just run a hole through the floor.
[10909.12 --> 10913.72]  And if it's right where your setup is, you actually wouldn't need special cables.
[10913.72 --> 10918.86]  You might even be able to pass the cables through ducting, depending on the house.
[10918.98 --> 10919.88]  Yeah, depending on the house.
[10920.00 --> 10921.68]  It also might not be possible.
[10921.80 --> 10925.12]  But if you drill kind of close to the baseboard or whatever, then you might not even need to.
[10925.14 --> 10925.94]  You might be able to pass through that way.
[10926.00 --> 10936.70]  But like if you were afraid of drilling or maybe you're not the owner of the house, maybe you're living with your parents, something like that.
[10937.04 --> 10940.70]  You might be able to get away with it a little bit easier if you're like, yeah, I'm just passing a cable through ducting.
[10941.54 --> 10942.22]  It's not going to hurt anything.
[10942.54 --> 10942.90]  Man.
[10943.72 --> 10944.58]  That'd be pretty cool.
[10945.42 --> 10951.14]  Yeah, I would just be doing the cheaper, like I don't need the long cables version of what I'm doing now.
[10953.12 --> 10954.70]  Hey, Dan, Luke, and Linus.
[10954.80 --> 10956.04]  I hope you had a merry Chrysler.
[10956.80 --> 10957.92]  Linus, have you ever...
[10957.92 --> 10958.78]  That's an interesting autocorrect.
[10960.06 --> 10960.72]  No, no.
[10960.84 --> 10962.14]  I think people do that on purpose.
[10963.22 --> 10969.20]  Linus, have you ever considered doing a line of ruggedized EDC tech items for tech or IT people?
[10969.20 --> 10972.92]  We'd love to, but to do it better is really hard.
[10972.92 --> 10977.28]  To just, you know, slap your brand on a screwdriver.
[10977.52 --> 10978.58]  It's really easy.
[10979.00 --> 10983.40]  And that's what makes it so much more frustrating when people accuse us of doing that.
[10983.90 --> 10984.14]  It's merch.
[10984.14 --> 10985.54]  Because that's not what we did.
[10985.80 --> 10991.32]  Making something really good and better than what's out there is really, really hard.
[10991.32 --> 11004.64]  And so, you know, whatever it is, side cutters, needle nose pliers, you know, a work surface, a project, magnetic project matter, parts, whatever.
[11004.64 --> 11010.46]  You know, there's the easy way to do it, which is to just, like, clone what's already there and put your brand on it.
[11011.30 --> 11018.18]  And then there's the us way of doing it, which is take two years and make sure that it is absolutely f***ing awesome.
[11018.98 --> 11019.22]  Yeah.
[11019.48 --> 11022.74]  So, yeah, we're going to do stuff, but it's going to take time.
[11022.74 --> 11023.66]  Yeah.
[11025.10 --> 11027.00]  Can you stack screwdriver...
[11027.00 --> 11027.38]  Sorry?
[11027.58 --> 11027.78]  Sorry.
[11028.14 --> 11029.70]  Can you stack screwdriver shafts?
[11029.80 --> 11031.72]  I want to make a mega LTT driver.
[11032.14 --> 11037.60]  Also, if you ever bundle JerryRigEverything knife with the stubby screwdriver, can you please call it the stabby screwdriver?
[11039.44 --> 11040.18]  Oh, boy.
[11040.34 --> 11040.78]  No.
[11040.78 --> 11041.18]  No.
[11042.16 --> 11046.96]  And as for the answer to your other question, there's a little bit of play.
[11047.08 --> 11047.92]  You'll have a lot of play.
[11047.92 --> 11048.92]  In the shaft extensions.
[11049.14 --> 11049.20]  Yeah.
[11049.52 --> 11053.90]  That's going to be, what is it, exponential or multiply?
[11054.22 --> 11054.62]  Multiplied.
[11054.76 --> 11056.28]  It'll be multiplied, yes.
[11056.62 --> 11059.88]  So if it's two x play, this will be four.
[11060.34 --> 11064.12]  The next one will be, what would it be, eight, I guess?
[11064.12 --> 11072.02]  So, like, by the time you get out there, you're looking at a lot of playboys.
[11072.84 --> 11073.72]  Would it be six?
[11074.14 --> 11074.76]  Maybe it would be six.
[11074.76 --> 11074.96]  I'm wondering.
[11075.16 --> 11075.86]  It might be additive.
[11076.34 --> 11077.64]  I think it's just additive.
[11078.10 --> 11078.28]  Yeah.
[11078.34 --> 11078.56]  Okay.
[11078.66 --> 11078.78]  No.
[11078.90 --> 11079.04]  Yeah.
[11079.04 --> 11080.98]  It should be just additive because it would be...
[11080.98 --> 11081.76]  Yeah.
[11081.82 --> 11082.30]  It would be additive.
[11084.44 --> 11086.68]  It would start to feel pretty wobbly.
[11087.26 --> 11093.54]  We did make these a little bit bigger than his standard so that because our tolerances are
[11093.54 --> 11095.38]  really tight for our hex drive here.
[11096.26 --> 11100.90]  We know it'll fit in ours, but if someone else's tolerances are off, our shaft extension
[11100.90 --> 11102.18]  might not fit in their driver.
[11102.70 --> 11105.54]  So it's not bad, but it's...
[11106.88 --> 11107.30]  Yeah, I don't know.
[11107.34 --> 11110.26]  By the time you have two or three of them in there, it's going to be pretty wobbly.
[11112.44 --> 11114.90]  Hey, LLD from Bellingham, Washington.
[11115.14 --> 11116.08]  It'll be a weird shower.
[11117.86 --> 11118.62]  Weird shaft.
[11118.84 --> 11119.22]  Weird shower.
[11119.22 --> 11120.84]  There's a mention about that in Flowplane chat.
[11120.92 --> 11121.54]  That is very funny.
[11121.54 --> 11123.54]  I don't know what the URL is.
[11123.58 --> 11124.80]  I'm not searching that on the computer.
[11125.20 --> 11128.38]  Luke, I've heard over the years that you enjoy taking mental health walks.
[11128.48 --> 11130.60]  Do you usually listen to content while walking?
[11130.76 --> 11131.40]  If so, which ones?
[11132.40 --> 11133.20]  Not always.
[11134.32 --> 11135.64]  Sometimes I'll do something else.
[11135.76 --> 11137.76]  Sometimes I'll think about a particular thing.
[11140.88 --> 11142.52]  Motorbike rides are really good for that.
[11142.90 --> 11143.12]  Yeah.
[11143.12 --> 11148.90]  I find that if you're focused on more than one thing, you'll die.
[11149.14 --> 11152.52]  So the motivation to stay focused is really strong.
[11153.08 --> 11156.00]  But I know you don't really ADHD as much as I do.
[11156.10 --> 11157.90]  So maybe your jam is different.
[11158.46 --> 11162.84]  No, but sometimes I'll be needing to work through something that's very complicated.
[11162.84 --> 11170.98]  And if I'm at my desk, I can get very distracted by messages coming in or emails coming in or whatever.
[11171.18 --> 11177.36]  And if I need to just stay sunk on a topic, whether this is for personal life or whatever else, sometimes it's good.
[11177.50 --> 11179.16]  It's like the shower thought situation.
[11179.50 --> 11180.74]  You can do it with a shower too.
[11181.10 --> 11183.86]  I'm just doing the same thing, but walking around.
[11183.86 --> 11188.78]  I don't necessarily think of it too much.
[11188.98 --> 11195.66]  I absolutely think it does help with mental health stuff, but I don't necessarily think of it too much as like I'm going for a walk for my mental health.
[11196.58 --> 11200.88]  I'm just going for a walk because I think it's just good for me.
[11202.22 --> 11203.80]  I think it's a good thing to do.
[11203.80 --> 11210.00]  And I think sometimes, at least personally, if I attribute too many things to like, I'm doing this for mental health.
[11210.00 --> 11217.32]  It like, I don't know why, but it doesn't feel super helpful for me personally.
[11217.64 --> 11220.18]  I think sometimes it's just like, I'm doing this because I should.
[11220.32 --> 11220.98]  It's good for me.
[11221.40 --> 11222.48]  I want to do this thing.
[11222.58 --> 11224.32]  Like I like going for walks at this point.
[11224.48 --> 11226.34]  I've found a lot of things that I can do.
[11226.54 --> 11227.82]  I can play Pokemon Go.
[11228.02 --> 11229.28]  I can listen to things.
[11229.36 --> 11230.30]  You mentioned listening to things.
[11230.38 --> 11235.22]  I like listening to the yard and Andrew Huberman and some other stuff.
[11235.30 --> 11236.26]  But those are the main two.
[11236.84 --> 11238.22]  I can think about stuff.
[11238.22 --> 11241.44]  I can go with a walk with somebody else and just talk to them about it.
[11243.18 --> 11244.60]  I like doing it at this point.
[11245.10 --> 11252.38]  Like I think one of the biggest increases I had in mental health stuff in the last year or so was I started working out a lot.
[11254.22 --> 11258.76]  But I don't think I should attribute working out to like, I'm doing this for mental health.
[11258.94 --> 11261.66]  I'm doing it because honestly, I started enjoying it a lot.
[11261.80 --> 11262.78]  I enjoy the process.
[11262.88 --> 11263.86]  I have fun doing it.
[11264.10 --> 11266.66]  I've started going with other people and that's been fun.
[11266.66 --> 11268.48]  The social aspect of it's been fun.
[11268.56 --> 11269.56]  I've been learning a lot about it.
[11269.60 --> 11270.76]  That's been mentally stimulating.
[11271.54 --> 11272.74]  I feel better.
[11272.86 --> 11273.74]  I feel stronger.
[11273.84 --> 11274.52]  I feel healthier.
[11275.32 --> 11277.64]  I feel less tired on average.
[11278.14 --> 11282.08]  I feel less kind of like somewhat paradoxically.
[11282.16 --> 11283.94]  I feel less sore in bad ways.
[11284.02 --> 11285.32]  I feel more sore in good ways.
[11285.38 --> 11285.86]  Like I don't know.
[11285.94 --> 11286.74]  Things are just better.
[11287.60 --> 11289.64]  So I do things because they're good.
[11289.64 --> 11292.42]  But that's a personal thing.
[11292.48 --> 11293.34]  I don't care what you call it.
[11293.78 --> 11294.02]  Anyways.
[11294.44 --> 11294.88]  Good.
[11295.82 --> 11296.46]  Hey, DLL.
[11296.66 --> 11304.88]  With all the different results of store product launches, do you see the team settling on a set of specialty areas or continually testing new categories?
[11305.28 --> 11306.60]  Also, power drill when?
[11308.60 --> 11308.92]  Ooh.
[11309.78 --> 11312.04]  Power drill, no time soon.
[11312.04 --> 11316.46]  Those get real complicated.
[11316.72 --> 11326.08]  As for settling on a set of specialty areas or testing new categories, I think that's one of the first things that our new CEO, Taryn, said when he came in here.
[11326.18 --> 11329.72]  It's like your product development process is very scattershot.
[11330.26 --> 11332.16]  You guys, what is it exactly?
[11332.30 --> 11335.42]  And the team's like, well, we just kind of make what Linus thinks is cool.
[11335.64 --> 11337.64]  It's like, yeah, that's not a process.
[11337.86 --> 11339.34]  That's something that we do need to improve.
[11339.34 --> 11344.68]  And I think that will help us lower the turnaround time for product launches.
[11344.80 --> 11346.82]  I think you're going to see more tools.
[11347.58 --> 11347.74]  No.
[11348.08 --> 11350.84]  You will certainly see more tools.
[11351.38 --> 11355.88]  There are some other categories that we are going to be getting into that are new.
[11356.42 --> 11358.14]  But tools is going to be a big focus.
[11358.28 --> 11359.82]  It's been a huge success for us.
[11360.36 --> 11363.54]  The customers are so happy with these things.
[11363.90 --> 11364.32]  They're great.
[11364.32 --> 11371.70]  We couldn't ask for a better product to help us fund new endeavors as we move forward.
[11372.26 --> 11373.80]  I know people that got one.
[11374.06 --> 11378.42]  I keep telling people they don't have to do this, but they got one kind of like to support, you know?
[11378.78 --> 11379.50]  Oh, like bought it?
[11379.96 --> 11380.20]  Yeah.
[11380.34 --> 11381.70]  They bought one to support.
[11382.28 --> 11383.82]  And then they get it and they're like, oh, wow.
[11384.80 --> 11385.68]  That's really good.
[11386.18 --> 11386.80]  I'm like, yeah.
[11386.80 --> 11390.10]  Come on.
[11390.22 --> 11390.42]  Yeah.
[11390.46 --> 11391.90]  That drives me crazy too, actually.
[11392.00 --> 11394.60]  It's like, I appreciate the support, but that's really not the point.
[11394.74 --> 11395.00]  Yeah.
[11395.12 --> 11397.72]  Like we try to not be merch.
[11398.02 --> 11398.38]  Yeah.
[11398.74 --> 11403.14]  Like we actually put a ton of work into not being merch.
[11407.54 --> 11409.18]  We should just stop calling it that.
[11409.52 --> 11409.84]  Probably.
[11409.94 --> 11411.04]  We should call them product messages.
[11411.44 --> 11412.14]  They'll be PMs.
[11412.92 --> 11413.64]  I know.
[11413.64 --> 11416.74]  That actually kind of works.
[11416.80 --> 11416.96]  Yeah.
[11417.04 --> 11417.48]  It kind of works.
[11417.52 --> 11420.94]  Except it usually stands for private in that context.
[11421.12 --> 11421.82]  And it could be.
[11422.10 --> 11422.12]  It could be.
[11422.12 --> 11423.82]  It could be public messages.
[11424.14 --> 11425.04]  Dan messages.
[11425.32 --> 11425.62]  Oh, God.
[11425.98 --> 11427.28]  Slide to slide into your DMs.
[11427.34 --> 11428.82]  Buy some stuff on lttstore.com.
[11428.94 --> 11429.42]  What if you're.
[11429.62 --> 11432.16]  What if you actually do somehow miss a day, though?
[11432.96 --> 11434.78]  I mean, I didn't think that was allowed to happen.
[11435.30 --> 11436.00]  No, no.
[11436.54 --> 11437.24]  I don't know.
[11437.88 --> 11438.02]  Yeah.
[11438.36 --> 11439.32]  DMs doesn't work.
[11439.98 --> 11440.38]  PMs.
[11440.44 --> 11441.00]  Merch messages.
[11441.56 --> 11443.16]  What could it be if they're not merch?
[11443.16 --> 11443.98]  PMs is all right.
[11444.06 --> 11444.68]  Public messages.
[11444.90 --> 11445.60]  Product messages.
[11446.58 --> 11447.14]  Private messages.
[11448.10 --> 11448.54]  I don't know.
[11449.74 --> 11450.06]  Hmm.
[11453.44 --> 11454.04]  Oh, yeah.
[11454.10 --> 11454.46]  Another one.
[11454.60 --> 11455.10]  Hey, LLD.
[11455.24 --> 11457.14]  Notice you're getting close to a video a day again.
[11457.36 --> 11460.28]  What are your thoughts on the current release schedule compared to what it used to be?
[11460.36 --> 11462.40]  And if there's an improvement on viewership?
[11462.64 --> 11462.78]  Cheers.
[11463.66 --> 11465.98]  It's always interesting to me.
[11465.98 --> 11470.10]  Hey, look, I appreciate you.
[11470.64 --> 11472.40]  Thank you for the merch message.
[11474.68 --> 11481.28]  But I do have to call you out a little bit here because this is a thing that is just,
[11481.36 --> 11488.08]  it's sort of bizarre to me how often it happens where people kind of, they kind of see what
[11488.08 --> 11489.06]  they want to see.
[11489.06 --> 11489.40]  Yeah.
[11489.88 --> 11490.32]  Um.
[11490.40 --> 11490.62]  Yeah.
[11492.80 --> 11501.00]  And I've seen a lot of people immediately, when we release videos back to back in two
[11501.00 --> 11511.12]  days, I've seen a lot of people, um, say like, whether it's positive, whether people are like,
[11511.12 --> 11515.22]  oh, this is great, they're back to daily uploads, or whether it's people saying, well, that didn't
[11515.22 --> 11517.28]  last long, they're back to daily upload.
[11518.70 --> 11523.76]  I've seen a lot of people that don't look at the bigger picture before drawing a conclusion.
[11524.66 --> 11532.82]  And I can't help but be both frustrated and amused by the irony, given the large percentage
[11532.82 --> 11537.60]  of the people complaining about it, seemed to be the crowd that was going after us about
[11537.60 --> 11540.78]  our supposed gross inaccuracy.
[11541.44 --> 11545.06]  Um, we are not back to daily uploads, not even close.
[11545.68 --> 11547.08]  Uh, and I can prove it.
[11547.72 --> 11552.56]  Um, oh, this is actually not the best way to do this because you can see the members only
[11552.56 --> 11552.96]  videos.
[11552.96 --> 11553.20]  Okay.
[11553.20 --> 11554.50]  So give me, give me a second here.
[11554.50 --> 11555.54]  I'll just bring up the dashboard.
[11556.88 --> 11560.34]  Um, what's the best way to get to the dashboard?
[11560.34 --> 11562.10]  While you do that, I can tell a fun story.
[11562.38 --> 11562.74]  Sure.
[11562.74 --> 11569.50]  Uh, the trash network also, uh, known as dank pods, also known as many other things,
[11569.50 --> 11571.32]  uh, is in float plane chat.
[11571.74 --> 11578.36]  Uh, and you'll have to tell me, uh, if, if there's a video of any of this somewhere.
[11578.88 --> 11582.34]  Um, I know you sent me one, but I don't know if there's like a different one or anything,
[11582.34 --> 11588.10]  but, um, one of the days that he was here, we planned to hang out and that day it just
[11588.10 --> 11590.76]  dumped snow here for some reason.
[11590.76 --> 11593.04]  Um, he had never seen snow before.
[11593.68 --> 11595.34]  So that was very convenient timing.
[11595.66 --> 11598.28]  Uh, we had planned to try to maybe see some snow that day.
[11598.46 --> 11600.42]  My car already has snow tires on it.
[11600.72 --> 11601.68]  This was very easy.
[11601.82 --> 11605.82]  So not only did he get to see snow down here, but we drove up to see more so he could see
[11605.82 --> 11606.86]  like lots of snow.
[11607.46 --> 11611.44]  Um, and we were messing around, hanging out in the snow, checking it out, making snowballs,
[11611.50 --> 11612.22]  doing stuff like that.
[11612.34 --> 11614.40]  And he asked for me to throw a snowball at him.
[11615.54 --> 11618.98]  And I, I told, I told him I'm very, I'm not good at throwing.
[11618.98 --> 11619.30]  Yeah.
[11619.54 --> 11623.32]  For someone who's so athletic, it's sort of pathetic watching you try to throw something.
[11623.44 --> 11624.54]  I'm really bad at throwing.
[11624.80 --> 11625.96]  Like it, it's weird.
[11626.08 --> 11631.48]  Like he's super athletic in certain ways, but then other ways it's just like, it's like,
[11631.60 --> 11631.88]  dude.
[11631.88 --> 11637.66]  I never, I never played any sport where I would need to throw things.
[11637.78 --> 11641.06]  And I know this isn't true, but it's like, did your dad not love you enough to teach you
[11641.06 --> 11641.64]  how to throw?
[11641.78 --> 11642.86]  Like, honestly, you know?
[11642.92 --> 11643.80]  I always hated it.
[11643.90 --> 11645.00]  I hated baseball.
[11645.28 --> 11647.04]  I, I didn't want to be a quarterback.
[11647.28 --> 11648.34]  This is not on his dad.
[11648.48 --> 11649.10]  A hundred percent.
[11649.20 --> 11649.92]  I know that.
[11650.00 --> 11650.16]  Yeah.
[11650.34 --> 11651.14]  This is on him.
[11651.22 --> 11651.86]  A hundred percent.
[11652.06 --> 11652.24]  Yeah.
[11652.50 --> 11653.22]  So I'm bad at that.
[11653.32 --> 11655.88]  I also just like destroyed my shoulder.
[11655.88 --> 11660.48]  So I like have to try to throw weird so that I don't, cause if I throw properly, I will
[11660.48 --> 11662.14]  genuinely deeply hurt myself.
[11662.36 --> 11662.62]  Yeah.
[11663.18 --> 11663.54]  Yeah.
[11663.54 --> 11664.20]  So I missed.
[11665.28 --> 11666.74]  I hit him right in the face.
[11669.68 --> 11675.60]  It was like, it was like on this corner of his face, there was snow like in the collar
[11675.60 --> 11676.62]  of his jacket.
[11676.62 --> 11678.50]  It was so bad.
[11681.42 --> 11686.36]  I was aiming for like middle of his chest, which would be probably what you'd expect.
[11686.54 --> 11691.28]  And I genuinely tried to hit there and then just whap right in the face.
[11691.62 --> 11691.82]  Whap.
[11693.20 --> 11694.60]  Well, it was a snowball.
[11695.12 --> 11695.34]  Yeah.
[11695.44 --> 11698.04]  It went, it dripped all the way down to his crotch.
[11701.32 --> 11704.04]  I think that would be a WAD, which is most of his name.
[11704.12 --> 11704.82]  So I think that works.
[11704.82 --> 11713.98]  Um, I mean, yeah, you really, uh, yeah, you really, you really got out there into that
[11713.98 --> 11714.36]  joke.
[11716.82 --> 11717.26]  Made.
[11718.08 --> 11718.44]  Wow.
[11719.92 --> 11720.32]  Wow.
[11721.00 --> 11721.20]  Wow.
[11721.74 --> 11723.54]  Anyways, that was actually a really fun day.
[11723.78 --> 11723.80]  Yeah.
[11723.80 --> 11724.60]  WAP still works.
[11725.76 --> 11726.12]  Wow.
[11726.14 --> 11726.58]  It does.
[11726.80 --> 11728.14]  I don't even think about that.
[11728.78 --> 11731.20]  Um, but yeah, it was, it was great.
[11731.28 --> 11732.04]  It was very fun.
[11732.14 --> 11733.00]  It's a big enough snowball.
[11733.00 --> 11734.40]  They could probably both get soaked.
[11734.82 --> 11739.76]  And they'd be dank.
[11742.76 --> 11743.80]  Oh, no.
[11743.90 --> 11744.34]  Dank penis.
[11750.66 --> 11751.78]  What's up, Wade?
[11752.06 --> 11752.58]  What's up, Wade?
[11752.58 --> 11752.76]  What's up, Wade?
[11753.00 --> 11756.68]  He managed to derail us from thousands of kilometers away.
[11756.68 --> 11760.14]  Oh my goodness.
[11760.36 --> 11765.30]  Well, hopefully he doesn't hate me more than when I hit him in the face with a snowball.
[11766.30 --> 11766.98]  Dank poos.
[11771.62 --> 11772.94]  Uh, yeah.
[11773.74 --> 11774.26]  All right.
[11774.30 --> 11774.56]  All right.
[11774.58 --> 11777.48]  Anyway, I've got our, uh, I've got our uploads over the last little bit.
[11777.48 --> 11781.74]  So, um, yep.
[11782.10 --> 11783.20]  Had one that day.
[11783.92 --> 11785.62]  Had not one that day.
[11785.82 --> 11788.98]  Oh, oh, this is filtered for videos with over a million views.
[11788.98 --> 11791.54]  So, wait, wait a second.
[11791.64 --> 11794.24]  Are we, um, open a new tab?
[11794.38 --> 11794.80]  Hold on a second.
[11794.88 --> 11796.62]  Am I missing a recent upload?
[11796.86 --> 11798.36]  That just doesn't have a million yet.
[11799.24 --> 11799.70]  Oh yeah.
[11799.72 --> 11800.54]  The all screen PC.
[11800.72 --> 11801.16]  Wait, what?
[11801.70 --> 11802.52]  What the heck?
[11802.52 --> 11803.52]  Okay.
[11805.32 --> 11805.68]  Okay.
[11805.86 --> 11807.80]  Well, I might have to do this manually.
[11809.16 --> 11809.86]  Uh, okay.
[11809.92 --> 11812.12]  Well, there's, there's a couple we're missing, apparently.
[11813.34 --> 11816.50]  Um, uh, that's really weird.
[11816.90 --> 11817.18]  Okay.
[11817.26 --> 11818.36]  So, December 26th.
[11818.36 --> 11818.54]  Okay.
[11818.58 --> 11819.14]  Missed a day.
[11819.68 --> 11820.24]  Back to back.
[11820.42 --> 11820.92]  Missed a day.
[11821.28 --> 11821.88]  Back to back.
[11822.12 --> 11823.24]  Missed three days.
[11823.80 --> 11824.48]  Back to back.
[11824.68 --> 11825.26]  Missed a day.
[11826.10 --> 11826.98]  Back to back.
[11827.74 --> 11828.80]  Missed two days.
[11829.74 --> 11830.56]  Missed a day.
[11831.00 --> 11831.84]  Missed a day.
[11831.84 --> 11832.82]  Back to back.
[11833.04 --> 11834.02]  Missed two days.
[11834.46 --> 11839.42]  Guys, we are nowhere near a daily upload schedule right now.
[11840.32 --> 11844.62]  Um, so I'm just, I'm finding the whole thing very confusing.
[11845.26 --> 11845.46]  Yeah.
[11845.50 --> 11845.70]  Okay.
[11845.74 --> 11846.52]  Now that one's there.
[11846.64 --> 11846.76]  Yeah.
[11846.80 --> 11847.64]  Good, good, good.
[11848.22 --> 11848.92]  A scam.
[11849.08 --> 11850.26]  Scammed myself on eBay.
[11850.82 --> 11851.04]  Yeah.
[11851.14 --> 11851.32]  Yeah.
[11851.40 --> 11851.80]  So, yeah.
[11851.80 --> 11852.36]  Three days.
[11852.44 --> 11853.14]  Three days difference.
[11853.90 --> 11854.58]  One day difference.
[11854.88 --> 11855.74]  Two days difference.
[11855.98 --> 11857.14]  One day difference.
[11857.68 --> 11858.80]  And the next actual.
[11858.92 --> 11859.06]  Yeah.
[11859.10 --> 11859.56]  One day difference.
[11859.62 --> 11859.72]  Yeah.
[11859.82 --> 11859.92]  Yeah.
[11859.92 --> 11860.10]  No.
[11860.18 --> 11860.32]  Yeah.
[11860.32 --> 11862.14]  It seems to be working other than the last couple of days.
[11862.76 --> 11865.08]  So, I don't know.
[11865.16 --> 11865.80]  I don't know, man.
[11865.88 --> 11866.56]  I don't, I don't know.
[11866.66 --> 11870.00]  I don't know what to say to people who just see what they want to see.
[11870.82 --> 11873.98]  And, um, there's a lot of that going around lately.
[11874.10 --> 11874.48]  I feel like.
[11874.48 --> 11880.58]  I think it, I, it doesn't matter because I don't think there's anything you could say.
[11880.76 --> 11881.86]  No, I don't think so.
[11881.86 --> 11892.04]  I saw, I saw, I saw a comment that like went into us about how wrong we were, um, about something in, oh man.
[11893.26 --> 11897.78]  I think it might've been the 115 inch TV or something like that.
[11897.78 --> 11912.88]  And it was, uh, I, I ended up replying to it cause I was feeling, I was in a mood and I was basically just like, yeah, this comment is like a huge problem because you are basically the problem.
[11912.88 --> 11923.84]  You're perpetuating this idea that, you know, we don't care about accuracy and that we haven't been doing a good job by raising a concern that is completely factually inaccurate.
[11923.84 --> 11925.68]  Like you're just, you're so wrong.
[11925.94 --> 11927.84]  You're not even, you're not even close to right.
[11927.90 --> 11929.08]  Oh, I remember what it was.
[11929.10 --> 11930.34]  It was from the all screen PC.
[11930.34 --> 11934.86]  They were like, yeah, LTT back at it again with the misinformation.
[11935.74 --> 11938.90]  This fan has configurable airflow direction.
[11939.52 --> 11951.06]  And it's like, all you had to do was go on the product page and like, like one of the like giant text things on there is that you can get it in two different configurations, regular airflow and reverse airflow.
[11951.18 --> 11952.24]  It's not configurable.
[11952.74 --> 11954.32]  Like, what are you talking about?
[11954.32 --> 11961.52]  And, and the, the, the way that we take so much flack over fact checking from people who can't be arse to check a basic fact, like how often we upload a video.
[11961.96 --> 11965.00]  It's like, are you, are you kidding me right now?
[11966.18 --> 11970.74]  The, the, the simplest fact to check, you can't be bothered.
[11971.94 --> 11972.94]  I don't know, man.
[11974.00 --> 11975.40]  Oh, it's good stuff.
[11975.72 --> 11976.36]  It's good stuff.
[11976.78 --> 11979.90]  I've been getting a little overwhelmed.
[11979.90 --> 11985.94]  And I think this might be one of the byproducts of me trying to disconnect from a lot of social media stuff.
[11986.22 --> 12001.88]  But when I do kind of check in on something, the overwhelming amount of negativity for something that I actually do just enjoy is like kind of pretty confusing sometimes.
[12001.88 --> 12010.54]  Um, like I'll be like, Hey, this thing, like I, I, I like this product or service or game or, or whatever it is.
[12010.74 --> 12014.60]  And then I'll, I'll be like, Oh, I want to like learn something more about this one part of it.
[12014.60 --> 12018.94]  Like, uh, I want to get better at this, or I don't understand this, or I wonder what people think about this or whatever.
[12019.04 --> 12026.08]  And then you look into that community and it's just, it's like that community meme when you walk into the room and everything's on fire, but you're holding pizzas.
[12026.08 --> 12028.96]  Cause you're all like excited to come over and it's like, wait, what the heck?
[12028.96 --> 12038.70]  And then sometimes you look into what people are mad about and it's like, okay, like, yeah, that's maybe fair to a certain degree, but the anger level does not match the issue.
[12038.84 --> 12044.66]  And there is little to probably genuinely zero consideration given to all of the good stuff.
[12044.76 --> 12055.90]  And I think, I don't necessarily think people understand the impact of setting the community of the thing that you enjoy on fire.
[12055.90 --> 12063.28]  Uh, because you're going to reduce adoption from other people, which might result in the thing that you enjoy just dying.
[12064.44 --> 12066.76]  Um, and like, I don't know if that's the result that you're looking for.
[12066.84 --> 12068.24]  You can give criticism.
[12068.46 --> 12068.64]  Yeah.
[12068.66 --> 12070.66]  I mean, that shouldn't make us impervious to criticism.
[12070.86 --> 12073.26]  You can absolutely give, I'm not even talking about us necessarily.
[12073.38 --> 12073.80]  Oh, okay.
[12073.80 --> 12074.06]  I see.
[12074.16 --> 12076.04]  It does apply, but that's not actually.
[12076.68 --> 12080.40]  Oh, so you're just talking about like toxic fan bases in general, but it's everything.
[12080.52 --> 12080.66]  Yeah.
[12080.66 --> 12081.22]  I can see that.
[12081.58 --> 12082.44]  It's everything.
[12082.72 --> 12082.96]  Yeah.
[12083.34 --> 12087.92]  Like it's, it's fan bases are toxic that I'm not necessarily toxic fan base.
[12087.94 --> 12090.62]  Like there's almost nothing like the amount of complaints.
[12090.62 --> 12098.04]  Like you look at how, just to talk about BG three again, you look at how well that game is rated, how well it's been received, how universally it's liked.
[12098.04 --> 12105.96]  And then you look into some of the communities and they're just on fire because of like some random crap that is like so unimportant and small.
[12105.96 --> 12110.58]  And sure, there's like a tiny blemish in the corner.
[12110.82 --> 12111.44]  Like, dude.
[12112.20 --> 12112.64]  Yeah.
[12112.74 --> 12115.92]  You've spent 600 hours playing this game.
[12115.98 --> 12118.62]  Like how mad can you actually be?
[12118.70 --> 12120.84]  And like, you should actually have like, I don't know.
[12120.88 --> 12123.14]  You should balance your things out a little bit sometimes.
[12126.86 --> 12127.26]  Yeah.
[12127.26 --> 12127.78]  I don't know.
[12128.02 --> 12130.10]  That's, I don't really have a huge point here.
[12130.20 --> 12132.74]  It just kind of sucks sometimes because I'll be like, yeah, this is cool.
[12132.74 --> 12134.86]  Oh, I found reply from buddy.
[12135.68 --> 12136.28]  From buddy.
[12136.40 --> 12136.60]  Yeah.
[12136.72 --> 12138.60]  Who I talked to about the Lee and Lee fans.
[12138.90 --> 12142.26]  So their message said the new Lee and Lee fans can flip their airflow.
[12142.62 --> 12145.04]  Again, LTT failed to know the products they use.
[12145.46 --> 12146.58]  I guess they didn't learn.
[12146.90 --> 12147.70]  So I replied.
[12147.78 --> 12150.38]  I said, they're available in two configurations, regular and reverse airflow.
[12150.38 --> 12152.26]  Like we had in the video, they are not user configurable.
[12152.28 --> 12152.94]  And I sent a link.
[12153.62 --> 12155.26]  So I actually wasn't that spicy.
[12155.32 --> 12156.06]  Oh no, I was spicy.
[12156.18 --> 12156.90]  I said, don't worry though.
[12156.90 --> 12160.70]  You're not the only one making mistakes in the rush to find errors in our videos to post in the comments.
[12160.70 --> 12163.10]  Maybe time to chill a bit and just enjoy the content.
[12163.84 --> 12164.96]  So buddy replies.
[12165.22 --> 12165.50]  True.
[12165.96 --> 12167.32]  However, line is still indicated.
[12167.44 --> 12168.60]  You didn't have a choice at all.
[12168.76 --> 12172.60]  Dishing out at the product because you were forced to have it as an intake again.
[12172.96 --> 12179.50]  But that's not, I just, I just said that the one we had was reverse airflow, which forced us to use it as an intake, which is true.
[12179.50 --> 12186.40]  Like they can't, they can't acknowledge the part that they played saying something completely inaccurate.
[12186.40 --> 12187.98]  No, they cannot flip their airflow.
[12189.48 --> 12190.72]  And so I was like, I don't know.
[12191.60 --> 12193.40]  I'm feeling, I'm feeling spicy.
[12193.82 --> 12194.66]  I'm feeling spicy.
[12194.72 --> 12195.30]  But you know what?
[12195.32 --> 12198.50]  I've actually been having more fun lately, which has been good.
[12198.56 --> 12199.70]  Maybe I need to be spicy.
[12200.14 --> 12200.46]  Sometimes.
[12200.76 --> 12203.38]  Maybe it's, uh, yeah, maybe it's, maybe it's not a bad thing.
[12203.44 --> 12207.08]  Maybe it's time to, maybe it's time to just have some fun, have some spice.
[12207.08 --> 12208.54]  Spice is the spice of life.
[12208.62 --> 12209.10]  You know what they say?
[12217.58 --> 12219.26]  Oh man, that's fantastic.
[12219.80 --> 12221.78]  Um, what are we talking?
[12222.18 --> 12222.74]  I don't know.
[12222.82 --> 12223.08]  Okay.
[12223.18 --> 12223.56]  Who knows?
[12223.62 --> 12224.12]  Who cares?
[12224.38 --> 12224.84]  Merch message.
[12224.84 --> 12225.26]  Does it matter?
[12226.04 --> 12231.14]  I mean, the spice over the last few WAN shows have been any indication.
[12231.84 --> 12232.04]  Yeah.
[12232.04 --> 12234.24]  I mean, if I haven't been canceled for the last couple of WAN shows, what are the odds?
[12234.24 --> 12235.58]  I mean, you've been having fun though, right?
[12235.58 --> 12236.82]  I have been having fun.
[12236.82 --> 12238.42]  That's, that's all that matters, right?
[12238.44 --> 12239.40]  I don't think it's been too bad.
[12239.50 --> 12239.70]  Yeah.
[12242.14 --> 12245.38]  You took company file structure and just randomly clicked around on things you hadn't looked
[12245.38 --> 12247.86]  at before and tried to open files that you didn't know what they were.
[12247.86 --> 12248.20]  That's okay.
[12248.20 --> 12249.06]  We're changing it anyway.
[12249.36 --> 12249.64]  Yeah.
[12250.14 --> 12250.46]  Yeah.
[12250.66 --> 12250.86]  Yeah.
[12250.86 --> 12252.18]  That could have gone so much worse.
[12252.46 --> 12253.38]  But that's not my point.
[12253.46 --> 12254.38]  Clearly I'm going to be okay.
[12254.38 --> 12255.02]  Even the new one, like.
[12255.10 --> 12255.72]  I'm going to be okay.
[12256.58 --> 12257.04]  It's going to be fine.
[12257.08 --> 12257.38]  You know what?
[12257.38 --> 12258.90]  I'm going to find another random folder to open.
[12258.90 --> 12259.10]  Nope.
[12259.40 --> 12262.54]  Dan, can you just turn off his, his, uh, his buttons?
[12263.28 --> 12265.12]  Can you make it so he can't click on his own screen?
[12265.12 --> 12266.74]  As his boss's...
[12266.74 --> 12267.04]  Nope.
[12267.24 --> 12267.66]  ...boss.
[12267.98 --> 12268.22]  Oh.
[12268.98 --> 12269.64]  Darn it.
[12269.80 --> 12271.38]  I order you to not do that.
[12271.46 --> 12272.06]  That's fine.
[12272.12 --> 12273.48]  I will not turn off your buttons.
[12274.30 --> 12275.26]  I love this though.
[12275.90 --> 12276.14]  Oops.
[12276.14 --> 12280.46]  I knew something was coming.
[12280.70 --> 12281.78]  I can hear it in his voice.
[12282.02 --> 12283.32]  I didn't know what it was.
[12283.58 --> 12284.22]  I love it.
[12284.60 --> 12284.80]  Okay.
[12284.80 --> 12287.72]  Give me a nice picture back.
[12287.86 --> 12288.12]  Okay.
[12288.58 --> 12289.98]  New, new Z drive?
[12290.56 --> 12290.96]  Yeah.
[12291.12 --> 12292.96]  Believe it or not, I didn't do this.
[12293.12 --> 12294.24]  Isn't that how we name things here?
[12294.36 --> 12294.98]  I think so.
[12295.06 --> 12295.76]  Was this you?
[12295.86 --> 12296.02]  Yeah.
[12296.74 --> 12297.14]  Terrible.
[12298.20 --> 12298.60]  Terrible.
[12299.60 --> 12300.36]  Bad Dan.
[12300.36 --> 12302.76]  Oh man.
[12303.54 --> 12304.08]  This is great.
[12304.60 --> 12307.50]  I mean, yeah, that's not the top level folder, thankfully.
[12307.88 --> 12310.08]  That'll, that'll get, it'll get destroyed.
[12310.20 --> 12313.04]  So is it not going to be top level folder Linus anymore?
[12313.20 --> 12314.56]  Because that would probably be a good thing.
[12314.72 --> 12314.90]  No.
[12314.96 --> 12315.80]  Oh, is that staying?
[12316.32 --> 12317.62]  No, we're getting rid of Linus.
[12317.78 --> 12318.54]  Yeah, that's, yeah.
[12318.60 --> 12321.62]  How are we going to preserve all of the old video projects though?
[12321.62 --> 12323.28]  How are we going to preserve the directory structure?
[12323.28 --> 12325.84]  Oh no.
[12326.90 --> 12327.70]  What now?
[12327.96 --> 12330.24]  No, I mean, a lot of the old stuff.
[12330.34 --> 12331.10]  We're not, are we?
[12331.10 --> 12336.10]  Shouldn't be too much of a problem because the projects themselves are collected in an,
[12336.26 --> 12336.96]  in their own folder.
[12337.30 --> 12337.70]  Yeah.
[12337.80 --> 12339.98]  The issue is that then you just have to remap everything.
[12340.06 --> 12342.28]  Whereas if it's just in there, then you don't have to.
[12342.96 --> 12347.28]  I think if you're opening this on an individual project, like trying to do it for all of them
[12347.28 --> 12348.88]  all at once would be very difficult.
[12348.88 --> 12353.22]  But if you had to open one of them, it's not really that hard because, uh, Premiere's
[12353.22 --> 12355.78]  just going to go like, oh, all the stuff is who knows where.
[12355.86 --> 12357.58]  And then you just point at the right folder and it'll figure it out.
[12357.84 --> 12358.04]  Yeah.
[12358.18 --> 12359.80]  No, I, I, I know.
[12360.10 --> 12361.02]  It's going to suck.
[12361.04 --> 12362.06]  It's like a minute or two.
[12362.12 --> 12362.32]  Yeah.
[12362.32 --> 12363.30]  I don't think it's that bad.
[12363.64 --> 12364.26]  I'm more.
[12364.72 --> 12365.00]  Yeah.
[12365.14 --> 12366.52]  Because there's all the dependencies too.
[12366.62 --> 12369.78]  It's not just the files you were using in that project folder.
[12370.08 --> 12370.88]  I actually.
[12371.60 --> 12377.08]  For me, it was the, uh, like the assets, like the Mogarts because they reference and they
[12377.08 --> 12378.78]  have, they're used in everything.
[12379.10 --> 12383.10]  The thing is I expected Edzl to be a little bit more concerned, but I think this is a bandaid
[12383.10 --> 12384.40]  that needs to be dealt with.
[12384.46 --> 12384.64]  Yeah.
[12384.98 --> 12386.52]  Uh, and then it'll get better.
[12386.66 --> 12395.46]  So, so you guys know on my home server, when the company was founded, I had Linus and Yvonne.
[12395.80 --> 12398.02]  So we each had our own documents.
[12398.28 --> 12404.04]  And then as the company was being founded, all of the textual documents pertaining to
[12404.04 --> 12407.86]  the company and corporation documents and contracts and all that kind of stuff went into,
[12407.86 --> 12413.06]  uh, Linus textual documents, Linus media or something like that.
[12413.10 --> 12414.24]  I can't remember exactly what it was.
[12414.36 --> 12419.50]  And then remember when we started the company, we worked out of my house.
[12419.50 --> 12425.92]  So I didn't have two servers, one for personal and one for the company.
[12426.12 --> 12426.56]  What?
[12426.60 --> 12427.40]  I could afford that?
[12427.48 --> 12427.84]  Get real.
[12427.94 --> 12428.14]  Right?
[12428.56 --> 12436.54]  So when I originally created the network share for editing, obviously, well, what was I going
[12436.54 --> 12436.78]  to do?
[12436.84 --> 12438.10]  Put it in the Yvonne folder?
[12438.44 --> 12444.54]  No, I put it in Linus folder slash Linus tech tips.
[12444.54 --> 12455.92]  Um, so over the years, as we built a new NAS and as we built a server room and a infrastructure
[12455.92 --> 12463.16]  team and all this stuff, we've been stuck with the top level directory Linus because
[12463.16 --> 12466.66]  if we didn't, it would break every other dependency down the chain.
[12466.80 --> 12470.16]  Every time we opened a project, it sounds like we're going to rip the bandaid off, but
[12470.16 --> 12471.30]  we're going to rip the bandaid off.
[12471.30 --> 12474.96]  And I don't think it will be as impactful as you think anymore.
[12475.14 --> 12476.84]  I actually don't think that's a good idea.
[12476.98 --> 12481.46]  I think it's any impact is too much impact for something as meaningless as just there's
[12481.46 --> 12483.66]  a Linus in a directory structure.
[12483.92 --> 12484.48]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12484.54 --> 12485.66]  Literally everything is changing.
[12485.76 --> 12486.56]  It's not just Linus.
[12486.68 --> 12487.62]  We're not getting rid of Linus.
[12487.68 --> 12488.76]  We're getting rid of everything.
[12488.94 --> 12489.10]  Yeah.
[12489.54 --> 12490.94]  Everything is being restructured.
[12491.34 --> 12492.04]  We're doing a lot.
[12492.06 --> 12492.82]  We're doing it properly.
[12493.04 --> 12493.26]  Yeah.
[12493.52 --> 12494.34]  Okay, fine.
[12494.96 --> 12496.60]  We're doing what you should have done.
[12497.64 --> 12498.72]  I was busy.
[12498.98 --> 12499.24]  Yeah.
[12499.24 --> 12502.64]  I was busy founding the company that employs all of us today.
[12502.82 --> 12503.68]  Sorry, not sorry.
[12503.88 --> 12504.00]  Yeah.
[12504.36 --> 12505.86]  Spicy Linus is here to stay.
[12505.96 --> 12507.92]  That's my New Year's resolution to be spicier.
[12508.06 --> 12508.84]  I'm so for this.
[12509.12 --> 12513.58]  Well, the thing is that you hired people to do stuff that you don't care about, right?
[12514.78 --> 12516.70]  Well, I shouldn't say I don't care.
[12516.78 --> 12519.12]  I actually do care about digital hygiene quite a bit.
[12519.58 --> 12520.20]  Like this is...
[12520.20 --> 12521.26]  Yeah, but are you going to do it?
[12521.36 --> 12522.82]  Do you care enough to do it yourself?
[12522.82 --> 12523.24]  Yeah, he will.
[12523.48 --> 12524.68]  No, he actually will.
[12524.80 --> 12524.98]  Yeah.
[12524.98 --> 12526.74]  No, my digital hygiene at home is fine.
[12526.92 --> 12528.64]  Like I had to find...
[12528.64 --> 12530.90]  I will 100% defend Linus on this.
[12531.02 --> 12537.50]  This Christmas, I had to find the home security footage I had of my brother-in-law opening a
[12537.50 --> 12541.26]  bottle of wine and blasting wine all over my dining room last year.
[12541.38 --> 12543.28]  And it took me about 20 seconds.
[12544.26 --> 12545.20]  It's like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[12545.24 --> 12545.70]  I got this.
[12545.88 --> 12546.66]  Don't even worry, dog.
[12546.66 --> 12553.66]  I have my own Linus logic ways of doing things sometimes, but no, I'm like super organized
[12553.66 --> 12554.30]  about my files.
[12555.80 --> 12557.36]  Yeah, I think I meant more mechanically.
[12557.48 --> 12559.92]  Like, are you going to sit down now and deal with this?
[12560.02 --> 12560.46]  At work?
[12560.56 --> 12560.74]  No.
[12560.86 --> 12561.66]  That's someone else's job.
[12561.78 --> 12562.30]  Yes, exactly.
[12562.42 --> 12562.84]  That's what it is.
[12563.28 --> 12564.08]  That's what I was saying.
[12564.20 --> 12564.36]  Yeah.
[12564.72 --> 12567.02]  But I'm impressed that you have good digital hygiene.
[12567.12 --> 12568.26]  That's extremely important.
[12568.56 --> 12568.92]  Yeah.
[12569.16 --> 12569.58]  Oh, man.
[12569.66 --> 12570.68]  It matters a lot to me.
[12570.68 --> 12571.82]  I hate not being able to find stuff.
[12572.32 --> 12572.62]  Yeah.
[12572.86 --> 12573.06]  Yeah.
[12573.06 --> 12574.00]  And I'm a hoarder.
[12574.00 --> 12576.98]  So, yeah, that's also important too.
[12577.26 --> 12579.52]  I'm slowly moving to my first 50 terabytes.
[12579.66 --> 12580.26]  We're nearly there.
[12580.32 --> 12580.70]  I'm scared.
[12581.66 --> 12582.78]  It gets worse, right?
[12583.22 --> 12583.46]  Yeah.
[12583.90 --> 12584.42]  Oh, God.
[12585.74 --> 12586.14]  100%.
[12586.14 --> 12586.74]  All right.
[12586.78 --> 12587.40]  Another merch message.
[12587.80 --> 12592.26]  Hey, LLD, are there any products or tech this year that you regret not doing a video
[12592.26 --> 12592.56]  on?
[12592.82 --> 12596.14]  Or were there any products that you were happy that you didn't do a video on?
[12596.14 --> 12601.64]  Oh, I want to cover the Vision Pro, but we don't play the game with Apple.
[12601.64 --> 12604.98]  With Apple, it's 100% unspoken.
[12605.10 --> 12609.10]  They would never be stupid enough to write it down, but you've got to play the game.
[12609.36 --> 12613.90]  You've got to make sure that any coverage you do of Apple is, you know, friendly.
[12614.86 --> 12617.52]  You know, just kind of friendly.
[12618.54 --> 12620.60]  You know, you have to be stylish.
[12620.96 --> 12621.78]  I'm not stylish.
[12621.92 --> 12622.72]  I've never been stylish.
[12622.94 --> 12623.00]  No.
[12623.50 --> 12626.88]  Apple can take criticism, but it has to be from someone cool.
[12627.38 --> 12629.08]  Good digital hygiene, not stylish.
[12629.08 --> 12629.52]  Yeah.
[12630.78 --> 12636.54]  You know, just dumping all your shit in iCloud and just, you know, paying for more iCloud
[12636.54 --> 12638.98]  storage because you ran out of space in iCloud.
[12639.26 --> 12639.98]  That's stylish.
[12640.66 --> 12641.68]  No, for real, though.
[12642.06 --> 12644.18]  Like, that's the meta that Apple wants.
[12644.28 --> 12649.38]  You have to be an Apple person, and that's how Apple wants you to do things, right?
[12649.44 --> 12652.18]  So it's, yeah, I would have loved to cover the Vision Pro.
[12652.22 --> 12653.30]  I'm very excited to try it.
[12653.66 --> 12653.84]  Yeah.
[12653.84 --> 12658.54]  They did some design decisions that we both strongly support.
[12660.46 --> 12662.84]  Week four of asking for gold screwdriver.
[12663.16 --> 12663.74]  Please do it.
[12663.84 --> 12663.98]  Okay.
[12664.06 --> 12665.02]  Cash is a little tight.
[12665.70 --> 12668.78]  I got a badminton center to build, got some bills to pay.
[12668.96 --> 12670.58]  It's been a challenging year.
[12671.60 --> 12672.98]  It's tough out there, man.
[12673.04 --> 12674.02]  This might be the solution.
[12674.38 --> 12677.06]  Sell exactly one of one to this person.
[12677.86 --> 12678.34]  Yeah.
[12678.34 --> 12681.34]  Get them to foot the entire bill plus, I don't know, 50, 100%?
[12681.44 --> 12681.82]  Somewhere around there.
[12681.82 --> 12682.74]  Look, I want one.
[12683.30 --> 12688.22]  I want to make one, but I think it's going to be very difficult to justify.
[12689.32 --> 12691.80]  You know when, like, albums go, like, platinum and stuff?
[12692.20 --> 12693.80]  Oh, like, the screwdriver goes gold?
[12693.92 --> 12694.14]  Yeah.
[12694.60 --> 12696.28]  I mean, sold 100,000 units.
[12696.44 --> 12697.50]  What's gold?
[12697.62 --> 12698.28]  Is gold...
[12698.28 --> 12698.78]  I don't know.
[12699.04 --> 12699.48]  I don't know.
[12703.44 --> 12703.80]  Okay.
[12704.04 --> 12704.28]  All right.
[12704.32 --> 12704.90]  Well, we're...
[12704.90 --> 12705.82]  500,000.
[12705.82 --> 12706.76]  We're a fifth of the way there.
[12706.84 --> 12707.48]  Yeah, 500,000.
[12707.48 --> 12707.90]  Almost a quarter.
[12708.22 --> 12710.44]  Actually, I think we're a quarter of the way there.
[12710.44 --> 12713.62]  If you get a million, you get platinum.
[12716.94 --> 12717.74]  I'm finding out.
[12717.84 --> 12718.40]  I'm finding out.
[12720.66 --> 12722.72]  You're going to have to take the next one while I look this up.
[12722.88 --> 12723.08]  Okay.
[12723.36 --> 12723.84]  What's up, Dan?
[12724.42 --> 12725.58]  Is there one for me?
[12725.82 --> 12726.88]  They all say, hi, Linus.
[12727.54 --> 12728.94]  Yeah, they only want to talk to Linus.
[12729.02 --> 12729.32]  Get rekt.
[12729.48 --> 12729.84]  Yeah, it's true.
[12729.96 --> 12732.44]  Did you look through any other ones in Potential?
[12732.44 --> 12734.68]  Hello, Sir Luke.
[12735.02 --> 12735.32]  Hey.
[12735.52 --> 12740.20]  What recent tech product in the last five years or so would you have liked to have had as
[12740.20 --> 12740.56]  a kid?
[12741.62 --> 12741.80]  Oh.
[12743.54 --> 12747.10]  Dude, as a kid, I would have been obsessed with a Steam Deck.
[12748.62 --> 12749.44]  My God.
[12750.20 --> 12750.92]  Oh my gosh.
[12750.98 --> 12753.44]  To be kids these days and having access to a Steam Deck is like...
[12753.44 --> 12755.86]  Holy crap, man.
[12756.54 --> 12758.12]  That's a whole thing.
[12758.12 --> 12761.84]  Imagine being able to land with just that.
[12763.58 --> 12764.66]  Like, wow.
[12765.68 --> 12767.24]  Would you ever do anything else?
[12767.94 --> 12769.12]  That might be the problem.
[12769.58 --> 12770.46]  Grab and go, man.
[12770.56 --> 12770.80]  Yeah.
[12770.94 --> 12771.60]  It's freaking awesome.
[12771.82 --> 12772.82]  I don't need a computer.
[12773.06 --> 12776.40]  Yeah, and I like that answer because I don't even have one right now.
[12776.52 --> 12779.02]  Because right now, I don't think it fits me super well.
[12779.26 --> 12781.82]  But when I was a kid, that would have killed.
[12783.32 --> 12783.98]  Oh, yeah.
[12783.98 --> 12787.44]  Every weekend, I was either landing at a friend's house or my house.
[12788.06 --> 12790.72]  Almost always my house, but often a friend's house.
[12790.76 --> 12791.48]  Depends what age.
[12791.70 --> 12793.24]  If you had it...
[12793.24 --> 12794.92]  Follow-up question to the question.
[12795.08 --> 12798.50]  If you had that as a kid, do you think you would be as into computers as you are now?
[12799.40 --> 12799.88]  Oh, yeah.
[12800.08 --> 12800.34]  Yeah?
[12800.72 --> 12801.18]  Oh, yeah.
[12801.26 --> 12802.24]  Yeah, because it's Linux.
[12802.72 --> 12805.88]  No, but I mean like the boxes and the stations.
[12806.12 --> 12806.42]  Oh, yeah.
[12806.46 --> 12807.46]  Because I would still want my desktop.
[12807.74 --> 12807.92]  Yeah?
[12808.10 --> 12808.28]  Yeah.
[12808.38 --> 12808.58]  Okay.
[12808.58 --> 12808.98]  100%.
[12808.98 --> 12809.94]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12809.94 --> 12810.34]  Yeah, yeah.
[12810.34 --> 12813.80]  I think it just would have replaced like Game Boys for me.
[12814.14 --> 12816.28]  Because I also pretty much always had a Game Boy.
[12817.10 --> 12819.28]  Yeah, I didn't do a lot of like handheld gaming.
[12819.44 --> 12821.52]  I had a PSP very late.
[12822.56 --> 12825.72]  Yeah, early on we were really broke.
[12825.84 --> 12828.86]  But my grandma got me a Game Boy.
[12830.60 --> 12832.12]  Which was pretty awesome.
[12832.26 --> 12834.30]  Like the original OG Game Boy.
[12834.58 --> 12834.86]  Oh.
[12834.86 --> 12838.66]  And then at one point in time, I don't remember how I got it actually.
[12838.92 --> 12839.36]  Oh boy.
[12839.52 --> 12840.78]  Someone probably gave it to me for Christmas.
[12841.02 --> 12842.16]  Now I'm going to feel like a jerk.
[12842.34 --> 12847.38]  But I had a Game Boy Advanced and our house got broken into and it was stolen and I was heartbroken.
[12847.52 --> 12849.34]  And then my dad explained what insurance is.
[12849.46 --> 12850.12]  And that was cool.
[12851.12 --> 12852.06]  That's a good life lesson.
[12856.42 --> 12858.02]  Wait, you mean I can just do this?
[12858.36 --> 12858.66]  Yeah.
[12858.78 --> 12859.02]  Uh-oh.
[12859.62 --> 12860.56]  No child.
[12860.56 --> 12860.60]  No child.
[12860.60 --> 12868.28]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12870.16 --> 12875.34]  But yeah, I think I really liked handheld gaming back then.
[12875.40 --> 12877.26]  I did it a lot more back then.
[12877.32 --> 12880.48]  There was a lot more scenarios that I would have been in where I would have done the thing.
[12880.68 --> 12882.88]  But I preferred PC games.
[12883.24 --> 12884.96]  I just wasn't always able to be on my PC.
[12885.18 --> 12890.34]  So being able to play PC games on this big handheld with a bigger screen, all this kind of stuff.
[12890.34 --> 12891.08]  Oh man.
[12891.36 --> 12891.50]  Yeah.
[12891.66 --> 12893.76]  Steam Deck would have killed back then.
[12893.90 --> 12894.18]  Amazing.
[12894.56 --> 12894.78]  Yeah.
[12894.80 --> 12896.34]  I might have another one here for you too.
[12897.00 --> 12898.26]  Linus seems busy.
[12898.58 --> 12899.28]  He's doing stuff.
[12899.66 --> 12901.96]  I'm just getting started with a career in e-commerce.
[12902.32 --> 12905.04]  We run on Shopify, same as LTT Store.
[12905.26 --> 12907.42]  What advanced skills should I go learn?
[12907.42 --> 12913.48]  I don't know.
[12918.16 --> 12919.86]  It really depends on your scale.
[12919.86 --> 12927.28]  But especially for smaller businesses with fewer products, Shopify is really good.
[12927.74 --> 12929.98]  You don't really need to do a ton to it.
[12930.48 --> 12934.60]  We do a lot of like very extra stuff.
[12934.60 --> 12937.60]  And I'm using extra in like the slang term.
[12937.60 --> 12942.70]  Um, we do a lot of stuff that like is great.
[12942.70 --> 12948.42]  Like Conrad, Conrad made the store snow because it's the like holiday season.
[12948.42 --> 12950.10]  And that's sick.
[12950.16 --> 12951.20]  I think it's awesome.
[12951.20 --> 12956.74]  I think it adds a lot of like flavor and, and style and personality to the site, different
[12956.74 --> 12957.54]  things like that.
[12957.62 --> 12958.60]  It's on the WAN banner too.
[12958.66 --> 12958.90]  Look at it.
[12958.92 --> 12959.28]  It's amazing.
[12959.34 --> 12959.48]  Yeah.
[12959.50 --> 12959.98]  It's sick.
[12960.12 --> 12960.52]  I love it.
[12960.56 --> 12961.80]  That's not necessary though.
[12961.94 --> 12963.04]  You don't need to do that.
[12963.04 --> 12966.02]  Um, so I, I don't know.
[12966.06 --> 12971.26]  I would learn probably front end focus stuff that works well with, with Shopify.
[12971.66 --> 12976.84]  Um, but honestly, I'd probably focus on the business side.
[12976.84 --> 12981.92]  If that's, if that's something that you also do, uh, because Shopify is very powerful right
[12981.92 --> 12982.36]  out of the box.
[12982.48 --> 12982.90]  All right.
[12982.90 --> 12983.18]  I'm ready.
[12984.12 --> 12985.60]  I included all of them.
[12986.04 --> 12987.26]  I don't even remember what you were doing.
[12987.50 --> 12989.10]  Multicolored, Noctua, Stubby.
[12990.00 --> 12990.70]  Oh, okay.
[12990.80 --> 12990.92]  Gotcha.
[12990.92 --> 12992.14]  To find out if we've gone gold.
[12992.30 --> 12992.52]  Yeah.
[12993.04 --> 12997.86]  We are two fifths of the way there.
[12998.04 --> 12998.46]  Nice.
[12998.50 --> 13002.62]  We have sold 197,309 screwdrivers.
[13003.88 --> 13004.86]  That's pretty good.
[13005.14 --> 13006.18]  It's pretty good.
[13006.36 --> 13007.70]  It's a lot of screwdrivers.
[13010.20 --> 13011.52]  Does that include streaming?
[13012.06 --> 13012.54]  Oh no, wait.
[13015.06 --> 13016.16]  It's for music.
[13016.44 --> 13017.78]  They had to add new rules.
[13018.06 --> 13019.00]  Streaming screwdrivers.
[13019.32 --> 13019.66]  Yeah.
[13019.66 --> 13020.38]  That's very funny.
[13020.88 --> 13021.54]  No, it's not.
[13021.68 --> 13021.94]  No, no.
[13021.96 --> 13022.72]  It was really funny.
[13022.72 --> 13023.40]  I just was.
[13023.40 --> 13023.96]  Don't patronize me.
[13024.00 --> 13025.12]  No, I was just distracted.
[13026.64 --> 13027.78]  I didn't get it at first.
[13027.84 --> 13028.48]  It took me a second.
[13028.56 --> 13028.70]  Yeah.
[13028.74 --> 13035.48]  The screwdriver has been, for those of you doing the math at home, um, a, an absolute smash
[13035.48 --> 13043.00]  hit success for us has, uh, helped fund a lot of investments we've made, has helped weather
[13043.00 --> 13044.00]  recent storms.
[13044.00 --> 13044.36]  Yeah.
[13044.36 --> 13049.56]  It's, uh, we owe a lot to this bad boy collectively.
[13050.12 --> 13051.28]  It's a good product.
[13051.62 --> 13051.86]  Yeah.
[13051.96 --> 13052.82]  Good product.
[13053.02 --> 13053.26]  Yeah.
[13053.38 --> 13053.78]  All right.
[13055.00 --> 13055.46]  Hit me, Dan.
[13055.46 --> 13059.06]  Um, regarding the lands website.
[13059.06 --> 13060.72]  Um, regarding the lands website, what would you think?
[13061.72 --> 13062.16]  Yeah.
[13062.38 --> 13063.56]  The labs website.
[13063.70 --> 13063.94]  Okay.
[13064.14 --> 13068.28]  What would you think about allowing verified creators to upload their own review videos
[13068.28 --> 13069.14]  on certain items?
[13069.14 --> 13073.10]  Say a link to a certain monitor video from a hub alongside your data.
[13073.10 --> 13081.72]  I think linking to a video isn't really the, uh, we've talked about having user ratings.
[13081.72 --> 13082.22]  Our data.
[13083.28 --> 13089.56]  Um, so we've talked about having user ratings alongside trust levels.
[13090.02 --> 13099.44]  So users who have a long, uh, history of a high trust ratings, for example, um, who we've
[13099.44 --> 13104.74]  even talked about having some kind of system where people can verify ownership through
[13104.74 --> 13109.74]  us, um, so that we can have like verified reviews, verified purchasers.
[13109.92 --> 13110.68]  Just be super clear.
[13110.76 --> 13117.00]  These are all aspirational and maybe very likely who knows, doesn't whatever.
[13117.18 --> 13118.04]  We might not make it.
[13118.46 --> 13120.28]  This isn't, we're not saying we're doing this thing.
[13121.36 --> 13125.58]  But, um, you know, we're definitely open to third party contributions.
[13126.08 --> 13128.24]  So, you know, you could have trust.
[13128.24 --> 13130.66]  So for something like the idea of them.
[13131.28 --> 13131.38]  Yeah.
[13131.46 --> 13135.78]  For something like the number of CUDA cores on a GPU, you know, the trust level would be
[13135.78 --> 13138.18]  the highest if we have independently measured.
[13138.44 --> 13139.44]  This is from labs.
[13139.72 --> 13141.06]  The trust level would be next.
[13141.06 --> 13145.80]  If the manufacturer's website says that's how many CUDA cores it has, the trust level would
[13145.80 --> 13146.92]  be next down.
[13146.92 --> 13150.60]  If it came from a third party, you know, trusted source.
[13150.60 --> 13155.10]  And then if we had like two trusted sources that said, Hey, that number from the manufacturer
[13155.10 --> 13155.68]  is not right.
[13155.76 --> 13157.00]  That would raise a flag.
[13157.08 --> 13157.32]  Yeah.
[13157.32 --> 13159.06]  Ideally, this is how it'd work.
[13159.12 --> 13160.50]  And someone would go and investigate it.
[13160.58 --> 13164.16]  Then it would become allegedly, then it would become a labs tested value and then it would
[13164.16 --> 13165.30]  be trusted.
[13165.30 --> 13166.90]  So there, there's a lot to work out.
[13168.78 --> 13173.00]  There's a lot of issues with that type of stuff of like how those systems work, how those
[13173.00 --> 13176.66]  systems interact, how they can be gamed, how they can be gamed, all this different type
[13176.66 --> 13176.90]  of stuff.
[13176.90 --> 13179.52]  So there's, there's a lot of things we would need to figure out.
[13179.52 --> 13181.04]  That's not a coming soon.
[13181.04 --> 13183.00]  That's not even a necessarily coming ever.
[13183.16 --> 13185.46]  It's something that we think would be pretty cool.
[13185.96 --> 13189.70]  So we'd like to do it, but there's a lot of other hurdles we need to jump first.
[13189.70 --> 13193.10]  So don't, don't hold your breath.
[13193.88 --> 13194.32]  Hi, DLL.
[13194.54 --> 13199.96]  When you build data servers, why do you always use Seagate IronWolfs and never WD drives?
[13199.96 --> 13203.72]  I don't know if we've ever used IronWolfs.
[13203.72 --> 13205.34]  IronWolf Pros we've used.
[13205.38 --> 13208.62]  We've used Seagate's NAS drives or not NAS drives.
[13208.68 --> 13210.00]  We've used their enterprise drives.
[13212.88 --> 13215.92]  A lot of time it comes down to availability.
[13216.42 --> 13217.50]  It comes down to price.
[13217.70 --> 13221.22]  It comes down to brands that we like working with.
[13224.10 --> 13227.16]  We've had good experiences, honestly, with the drives that we've had.
[13227.16 --> 13230.50]  We've had a lot of people tell us what idiots we are for using Seagate.
[13230.76 --> 13234.90]  Of course, we've had some drive failures, but some of those servers have been in deployment
[13234.90 --> 13236.00]  for like five years now.
[13236.06 --> 13237.26]  You're going to have drive failures.
[13237.42 --> 13238.60]  That's their mechanical devices.
[13238.74 --> 13239.14]  They fail.
[13239.88 --> 13244.10]  But that's never been a problem that couldn't be recovered from.
[13244.20 --> 13248.04]  We did have those file system rod issues, but those are nothing to do with the drives.
[13248.08 --> 13250.02]  That was to do with the misconfiguration of ZFS.
[13252.34 --> 13252.98]  I don't know.
[13252.98 --> 13258.90]  I mean, at this point, we just, I personally, I guess this is probably the best way to put
[13258.90 --> 13258.98]  it.
[13259.02 --> 13259.74]  I don't care.
[13260.64 --> 13267.32]  To me, a hard drive is a relatively commodity item that I fully expect to fail.
[13267.32 --> 13274.80]  And so every system that relies on hard drives has redundancies in it.
[13274.84 --> 13275.00]  Yeah.
[13275.20 --> 13280.82]  So that when it fails, because it will, it's a matter of time, not if, when it fails, we
[13280.82 --> 13285.38]  can put a new one in and then it can rebuild and then we can keep chugging along.
[13285.56 --> 13287.64]  Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
[13287.64 --> 13293.56]  Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
[13293.56 --> 13294.44]  It's a reference.
[13294.86 --> 13295.68]  Don't worry about it.
[13295.78 --> 13296.00]  Okay.
[13296.06 --> 13296.18]  Yeah.
[13296.18 --> 13297.00]  They're consumables.
[13297.52 --> 13297.76]  Yeah.
[13297.86 --> 13298.26]  Exactly.
[13298.38 --> 13298.86]  Willing spy.
[13302.42 --> 13303.22]  Hey, DLM.
[13303.48 --> 13309.04]  Have any of you had experience with 900 megahertz mesh wifi, not LoRa or Z-Wave?
[13309.40 --> 13314.40]  I'd love to see a video on it as it's a really unique technology and generally doesn't get
[13314.40 --> 13314.96]  much coverage.
[13315.42 --> 13317.86]  I have never heard of it, but that does sound really cool.
[13319.24 --> 13325.18]  I work at a Lego store and customers are constantly mistaking AI generated images on social media
[13325.18 --> 13326.14]  for real products.
[13326.24 --> 13327.38]  This is a huge thing.
[13327.38 --> 13328.06]  And asking us for them.
[13328.48 --> 13330.00]  What do you think could be done to help people with this?
[13330.10 --> 13330.96]  That messed me up.
[13330.96 --> 13332.96]  Reading this merch messages, I was...
[13332.96 --> 13333.98]  Oh, uh-oh.
[13334.18 --> 13336.78]  This is a huge thing specifically with Lego right now.
[13336.84 --> 13337.28]  I can imagine.
[13337.56 --> 13338.32]  They're getting...
[13338.32 --> 13338.82]  That's hilarious.
[13339.04 --> 13339.32]  Sorry.
[13339.48 --> 13341.34]  I don't have to work at the Lego store and deal with it.
[13341.40 --> 13342.30]  So for me, it's funny.
[13342.40 --> 13344.62]  But for you, I can see it being a major inconvenience.
[13344.92 --> 13345.24]  Yeah.
[13345.30 --> 13351.00]  Like apparently my brother was telling me that he got tricked by one that was, I think,
[13351.02 --> 13352.14]  a shoe or something.
[13352.42 --> 13352.66]  Yeah.
[13352.78 --> 13354.98]  Like it was a Nike, like Air Force One.
[13355.28 --> 13356.04]  He didn't say that.
[13356.06 --> 13357.38]  I'm just pulling that out of the top of my head.
[13358.44 --> 13358.64]  Yeah.
[13358.64 --> 13359.28]  Because that's a plane.
[13359.28 --> 13360.28]  It looked...
[13360.28 --> 13364.20]  Wow.
[13365.44 --> 13365.96]  It's also a shoe.
[13368.02 --> 13368.94]  A plane one.
[13369.04 --> 13369.70]  It's not very fancy.
[13369.70 --> 13371.18]  Oh my God.
[13372.46 --> 13373.48]  Oh man.
[13375.40 --> 13375.98]  Anyways.
[13376.90 --> 13378.24]  And yeah, it wasn't real.
[13378.60 --> 13384.10]  And apparently there's this whole series of videos, which is like fake mock-up Lego stuff.
[13385.14 --> 13386.12]  Which is interesting.
[13386.46 --> 13389.16]  You know what I find very intriguing about it?
[13389.16 --> 13392.50]  Imagine being the company that this is happening to.
[13392.96 --> 13398.66]  And instead of getting mad, using it as product feasibility testing.
[13398.66 --> 13401.52]  I think that Lego already...
[13401.52 --> 13403.18]  I mean, they already have avenues for that.
[13403.44 --> 13403.64]  Yeah.
[13403.70 --> 13404.88]  For like fan creations.
[13405.32 --> 13411.12]  And just having an AI image doesn't help assess whether that could be built or not.
[13411.96 --> 13412.80]  So like...
[13412.80 --> 13413.90]  But I mean, it's Lego.
[13415.18 --> 13415.62]  Yeah.
[13416.10 --> 13417.72]  You can build a version of it somehow.
[13418.08 --> 13418.98]  Pretty much no matter what it is.
[13418.98 --> 13422.02]  I just think they don't have a shortage of ideas.
[13422.20 --> 13425.88]  I think it's a shortage of resources to bring these things to market.
[13427.04 --> 13428.30]  That's my suspicion.
[13428.30 --> 13431.66]  I don't think that's true, personally.
[13432.42 --> 13435.56]  I would be hard-pressed to say the Lego has a shortage of resources.
[13435.80 --> 13436.06]  Well, no.
[13436.22 --> 13436.30]  I mean...
[13436.94 --> 13437.30]  I think it's...
[13437.94 --> 13439.08]  They don't want to oversaturate.
[13439.18 --> 13440.04]  So they need to pick their battles.
[13440.12 --> 13441.54]  Well, designers...
[13441.54 --> 13447.04]  And when I say resources, I mean like every individual part has to be warehoused.
[13447.96 --> 13454.72]  Like it is a spectacularly costly endeavor to bring a Lego set to market.
[13454.72 --> 13456.92]  What I'm saying is I think it's...
[13456.92 --> 13458.56]  They have to pick ones to do.
[13459.34 --> 13461.32]  Because you can't oversaturate your market either.
[13461.82 --> 13466.08]  So what I think this would help with is how interested people are in that thing.
[13466.42 --> 13467.32]  Yeah, I can see that.
[13467.32 --> 13468.42]  So they can be more sure when they're launching.
[13468.48 --> 13469.76]  But they also just do have avenues for that.
[13469.76 --> 13471.58]  Not for coming up with ideas at all.
[13471.70 --> 13475.04]  But they have like a voting system for the ideas that the public submits and stuff.
[13475.04 --> 13475.82]  Like it's a whole thing.
[13475.82 --> 13478.30]  We know what happens with voting systems.
[13478.30 --> 13478.88]  Well, this is true.
[13479.06 --> 13480.82]  70% of people use Firefox.
[13481.08 --> 13481.36]  Yeah.
[13481.44 --> 13481.62]  Yeah.
[13481.72 --> 13482.12]  Sure.
[13483.02 --> 13484.14]  Sure, guys.
[13484.14 --> 13485.82]  Although that worked really well.
[13485.90 --> 13489.76]  I've gotten a few messages today that Firefox users have subscribed to Floatplane just to
[13489.76 --> 13490.44]  increase the numbers.
[13490.64 --> 13491.82]  So welcome, everybody.
[13492.72 --> 13493.74]  Okay, that's hilarious.
[13493.78 --> 13494.10]  Thank you.
[13494.76 --> 13496.08]  I hope you enjoy your stay.
[13496.20 --> 13497.46]  If only it was always that easy.
[13497.68 --> 13498.12]  Yeah.
[13499.56 --> 13500.48]  That'd be sick.
[13501.76 --> 13502.78]  Anyways, next up, Dan.
[13502.78 --> 13504.22]  Floatplane's kind of popping off again, though.
[13505.18 --> 13505.64]  It's going up.
[13505.86 --> 13506.10]  Yeah.
[13506.56 --> 13507.08]  It's been nice.
[13507.08 --> 13509.18]  I think a big part of it is the exclusives.
[13509.32 --> 13511.32]  They're just killing it.
[13511.32 --> 13512.30]  Banger after banger.
[13512.42 --> 13513.82]  The team's been doing an amazing job.
[13513.82 --> 13519.06]  I've been so excited for Dan and I's wedding game thing or whatever.
[13519.48 --> 13521.08]  Because that was so fun to film.
[13521.24 --> 13521.36]  Yeah.
[13521.46 --> 13522.42]  I'm excited for that to go out there.
[13525.52 --> 13526.86]  Okay, let's see what else we got here.
[13526.92 --> 13528.24]  We're into just potentials now.
[13528.32 --> 13529.24]  If you guys are okay with that.
[13530.36 --> 13530.62]  Oh.
[13531.34 --> 13532.74]  Oh, I haven't been doing it this week.
[13532.82 --> 13533.68]  I curated one for you.
[13534.08 --> 13534.52]  Thank you.
[13534.52 --> 13537.70]  I don't want to give you anything too over the top.
[13537.76 --> 13539.14]  Although we're in spicy Linus now.
[13540.18 --> 13542.44]  DLL, adding another screwdriver to my collection.
[13542.44 --> 13546.26]  I unfortunately couldn't make it to LTX for the Build Your Own Screwdriver booth.
[13546.66 --> 13550.38]  Do you think we'll be able to anodize the new Alu screwdriver?
[13550.38 --> 13552.38]  It will be anodized.
[13552.62 --> 13555.16]  Raw aluminum looks so nasty after a while.
[13555.26 --> 13556.74]  It'll have clear anodization on it.
[13556.84 --> 13561.06]  So you would have to remove that coating, which can be very challenging to do without damage.
[13562.80 --> 13563.32]  Sorry.
[13563.32 --> 13566.54]  I'm just going to pick these at random.
[13566.74 --> 13567.12]  How about that?
[13570.84 --> 13571.52]  Curated one.
[13571.72 --> 13572.64]  Oh, there he goes.
[13573.62 --> 13577.52]  I recently used Google Barge to search for information on power supplies.
[13577.84 --> 13581.98]  The AI-generated text had sources that linked back to the LTT forums.
[13582.52 --> 13585.02]  How do you feel about content on your site being used for AI?
[13588.14 --> 13591.30]  I think for the forum, it bothers me a lot less.
[13591.30 --> 13595.12]  I know that from a user agreement standpoint, blah, blah, blah.
[13595.20 --> 13596.88]  We own the content, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[13596.96 --> 13600.56]  But realistically, that's not really the way that I view it.
[13600.78 --> 13606.34]  That would only ever matter if push came to shove and something terrible happened
[13606.34 --> 13608.42]  and we needed to defend our rights or something like that.
[13608.50 --> 13609.94]  And I guess it's kind of this.
[13610.08 --> 13615.28]  But I've never really felt like we own that in the same way that we do something that we paid for.
[13615.66 --> 13618.80]  There's already users reporting ways to scrape off the lab site.
[13619.46 --> 13620.40]  It's totally a thing.
[13620.40 --> 13629.16]  But the problem is, whatever you have, if you display something on someone's screen, it's scrapable.
[13629.22 --> 13629.72]  It's scrapable.
[13630.26 --> 13634.06]  And so with the lab site, I'm going to be a lot more prickly about it.
[13634.54 --> 13640.42]  But realistically, there may just be nothing that we can do about that.
[13640.48 --> 13648.96]  And we're just going to have to find ways to present the data that are better than what a scraper is capable of.
[13648.96 --> 13657.60]  And I think you saw some of the innovations that we're trying to build in the form of the team's idea to allow you to set your own graph colors.
[13657.60 --> 13670.96]  I think that idea that we had to make your own gameplay side-by-side FPS comparisons, comparing GPUs, is another way that a chatbot is not going to easily be able to replicate in the near future.
[13670.96 --> 13675.18]  So that's our goal is to just be better.
[13675.18 --> 13686.40]  Linus, if your kid cleverly bypassed your set parental controls and showed you, would you reward their tech skills or penalize them?
[13686.68 --> 13688.32]  Would you then fix the security flaw?
[13688.48 --> 13689.22]  Curious about your thoughts.
[13689.38 --> 13692.14]  If they told me, then I would reward them for being honest.
[13692.14 --> 13700.00]  If they didn't tell me and I found out, which I will and I do, then they are in extra big trouble.
[13700.12 --> 13702.64]  And I always tell my kids, what's the worst thing you can do?
[13702.72 --> 13704.72]  What's the most trouble you can get in in this house?
[13704.86 --> 13706.04]  And they know the answer.
[13706.14 --> 13707.18]  The answer is to lie.
[13708.88 --> 13709.96]  We always tell them.
[13710.04 --> 13710.62]  We understand.
[13711.46 --> 13712.18]  Kids make mistakes.
[13712.30 --> 13713.06]  People make mistakes.
[13713.20 --> 13714.28]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[13714.28 --> 13720.54]  But what we have no tolerance for is hiding them or lying about them.
[13721.00 --> 13722.70]  So my kids all know that.
[13727.08 --> 13729.00]  Got any more or shall I just pick one at random?
[13729.32 --> 13730.72]  Just pick them at random, I think.
[13731.32 --> 13738.12]  With regards to the semi-recent collaboration with Dank Pods, are there any other people you'd like to collab with in the near future?
[13740.06 --> 13740.80]  Collabs are hard.
[13741.48 --> 13742.42]  Yeah, they're great.
[13742.42 --> 13745.60]  You know, I always have a ton of fun.
[13745.88 --> 13747.82]  And when I'm done, I'm like, oh, I want to do that again.
[13748.04 --> 13750.30]  And then I kind of get back into the routine.
[13750.56 --> 13752.38]  And then it's like, oh, there's a lot of work.
[13753.80 --> 13756.70]  I mean, we have the Electroboom one coming soon.
[13757.28 --> 13758.18]  That's shot.
[13758.34 --> 13760.52]  That's, I think, mostly edited at this point.
[13760.56 --> 13762.18]  So that's something you can look forward to.
[13762.82 --> 13766.12]  But I don't think we have anyone else's names on the...
[13766.12 --> 13766.24]  Oh!
[13767.58 --> 13769.54]  We're collaborating with Ludwig in the new year.
[13770.16 --> 13770.46]  Nice.
[13770.46 --> 13770.86]  Yeah.
[13771.02 --> 13772.30]  So that's on the list.
[13772.42 --> 13773.90]  I might as well just tell you guys.
[13773.92 --> 13774.70]  Is that the gaming challenge?
[13775.00 --> 13775.30]  No.
[13775.58 --> 13775.80]  Oh.
[13775.88 --> 13777.22]  We might shoot that too while he's here.
[13777.26 --> 13777.60]  I don't know.
[13777.76 --> 13783.28]  But the real collab was actually inspired by bringing his bidets in at the store.
[13783.36 --> 13784.06]  We have them in stock.
[13784.14 --> 13785.52]  They're going to be listed on the site soon.
[13785.70 --> 13785.98]  Nice.
[13785.98 --> 13794.34]  And I wanted to make a PC that shoots water at the user when the character gets wet or something
[13794.34 --> 13794.92]  like that.
[13794.92 --> 13797.56]  It was supposed to be kind of bidet inspired.
[13798.14 --> 13801.94]  And then that morphed into the user punishing PC.
[13802.74 --> 13803.84]  The punishment PC.
[13804.00 --> 13804.58]  Is he the user?
[13804.88 --> 13805.24]  Oh, yeah.
[13805.24 --> 13805.32]  Yeah.
[13806.12 --> 13808.28]  So he's going to come up here is the plan.
[13808.58 --> 13809.34]  Things happen.
[13809.52 --> 13814.10]  And if it doesn't come to pass or whatever, it's not anybody's fault.
[13814.20 --> 13815.46]  Don't read anything into it.
[13815.84 --> 13820.62]  But the plan now from having chatted with him is he's going to come up here and he's
[13820.62 --> 13825.86]  going to use the computer and have no idea what could or may or will happen to him.
[13826.42 --> 13827.68]  So he's going to play some games.
[13827.78 --> 13832.76]  We've already got some games kind of mapped out that have good API access for us to have
[13832.76 --> 13833.92]  triggers that do things.
[13834.18 --> 13834.38]  Yeah.
[13834.62 --> 13835.88]  And it's going to be fun.
[13836.06 --> 13836.46]  That's good.
[13836.58 --> 13836.72]  Yeah.
[13836.72 --> 13837.46]  It's going to be some fun.
[13837.54 --> 13837.68]  Okay.
[13837.74 --> 13838.30]  So all right.
[13838.30 --> 13838.52]  All right.
[13838.52 --> 13838.70]  All right.
[13838.70 --> 13839.38]  We have collabs coming.
[13842.28 --> 13843.10]  Hi, LTT.
[13843.70 --> 13847.90]  What steps can I take to help my parents become more computer literate?
[13848.06 --> 13852.18]  I installed a PC for them with any desk for any time they need assistance.
[13852.34 --> 13854.10]  I can just hop on and help them.
[13854.30 --> 13855.06]  That's a great one.
[13855.86 --> 13859.88]  Um, it really depends on your parents.
[13860.02 --> 13864.58]  For me, I find my parents are, I am blessed with fantastic parents.
[13864.96 --> 13869.82]  Um, anytime I'm really interested in anything, they're pretty much also interested in it.
[13870.34 --> 13875.36]  Um, so just if you, if you find something cool you can do, or if you think of something
[13875.36 --> 13880.34]  that might be able to benefit them in some way, just enthusiastically show them and they'll
[13880.34 --> 13881.38]  probably be interested.
[13881.88 --> 13882.26]  I don't know.
[13882.26 --> 13885.88]  Um, you can't make people like things.
[13886.38 --> 13894.90]  Um, but you can try your best to make it seem interesting and cool and you're interested
[13894.90 --> 13896.22]  in it and you're doing this thing together.
[13896.22 --> 13897.00]  And yeah.
[13897.00 --> 13899.34]  Um, yeah.
[13899.44 --> 13903.96]  And if they don't take, if they, if they don't go with that, then I don't know, there isn't
[13903.96 --> 13904.60]  much else you can do.
[13904.82 --> 13905.34]  It is what it is.
[13905.34 --> 13911.10]  Oh, someone, uh, someone apparently replied or archived the one asking about our most expensive
[13911.10 --> 13911.70]  projects.
[13911.78 --> 13913.60]  I was going to rack my brain for that one.
[13914.50 --> 13916.48]  Um, golden controller.
[13917.04 --> 13917.94]  Oh, okay.
[13917.94 --> 13918.28]  Well, yeah.
[13918.28 --> 13920.96]  But it's only sort of because I still have the gold.
[13921.54 --> 13922.16]  Oh, fair.
[13922.22 --> 13924.98]  So like it's basically an, it's gone up in value.
[13925.16 --> 13926.36]  I think since then.
[13926.62 --> 13927.58]  So like, whatever.
[13928.30 --> 13935.18]  Um, some of the, some, like some of the scrapyard wars were really expensive to do.
[13935.18 --> 13939.64]  Um, expensive in terms of opportunity costs, in terms of salaries, in terms of the actual
[13939.64 --> 13941.76]  money we were spending, like buying stuff.
[13941.94 --> 13944.70]  Uh, scrapyard wars is a scrapyard wars is super expensive.
[13946.14 --> 13948.80]  Um, secret shopper is really expensive.
[13949.92 --> 13954.16]  That's why along with it being a ton of work, we only do it like every two or three years.
[13954.62 --> 13957.16]  I'm glad this one's finally over now.
[13957.16 --> 13959.46]  And there's, so there's so much feedback on the fourth one.
[13959.50 --> 13964.36]  It's like, yeah, you guys should really like release the episodes closer to get, you guys
[13964.36 --> 13965.34]  think we didn't think of that.
[13966.78 --> 13972.56]  Do you know how good it is for like float plane subscriptions and for viewership when
[13972.56 --> 13974.68]  we deliver serialized content on a schedule?
[13976.70 --> 13980.72]  And you'd probably be the first people to get mad at us for the, you know, crunch or whatever.
[13980.72 --> 13984.28]  If we did do them every week, like, come on guys, we're doing our best.
[13984.34 --> 13986.20]  We are in the grand scheme of things.
[13986.20 --> 13989.64]  I feel like there's this perception that we're like a gigantic company or something.
[13989.64 --> 13997.56]  We're a really, really, really lean medium sized company.
[13997.56 --> 13998.52]  Lean for medium.
[13998.76 --> 14001.06]  We are, we are not huge.
[14001.48 --> 14004.50]  We have 104 full timers or whatever it is.
[14004.50 --> 14005.30]  Plus contractors.
[14005.60 --> 14007.88]  I think we're at about 120 right now.
[14007.92 --> 14009.88]  Like that is, yeah, sure.
[14009.88 --> 14013.08]  It's like huge compared to most YouTube channels.
[14013.08 --> 14019.88]  But when you break it down, like we have three people in the camera department.
[14021.00 --> 14021.92]  That is.
[14022.16 --> 14024.12]  For all of these channels.
[14024.22 --> 14025.00]  For all these channels.
[14025.14 --> 14025.32]  Yeah.
[14025.36 --> 14026.68]  We, we, we run pretty lean.
[14026.78 --> 14027.40]  We work hard.
[14027.60 --> 14030.10]  We, um, you know.
[14032.28 --> 14032.84]  Yeah.
[14032.90 --> 14033.24]  Anyway.
[14035.16 --> 14036.40]  Hey, LLD.
[14036.62 --> 14037.28]  How was Christmas?
[14037.50 --> 14038.12]  Best gift?
[14038.58 --> 14041.60]  Linus, did your aunt's perfect gift pan out?
[14041.60 --> 14042.84]  What?
[14043.20 --> 14043.48]  Sorry.
[14043.58 --> 14044.00]  Best gift.
[14044.08 --> 14044.38]  What's that?
[14044.48 --> 14044.98]  You said don't ask.
[14045.04 --> 14045.20]  Yeah.
[14045.24 --> 14046.64]  You don't ask best gift.
[14047.14 --> 14047.50]  I don't know.
[14047.54 --> 14047.76]  Why not?
[14048.42 --> 14048.68]  No.
[14050.20 --> 14051.30]  I wouldn't answer it anyways.
[14051.56 --> 14052.44]  Your friendship.
[14052.84 --> 14053.16]  Wow.
[14053.66 --> 14054.00]  Yeah.
[14054.10 --> 14054.54]  There you go.
[14054.64 --> 14056.66]  And if this is a yes, I might cancel this order.
[14056.76 --> 14058.08]  The presence of my family.
[14058.08 --> 14059.68]  Uh, best, best gift for me.
[14059.68 --> 14060.30]  No, not them.
[14060.80 --> 14062.18]  I only got one gift.
[14062.60 --> 14066.38]  Uh, it was my aunt's perfect gift and it was actually banging.
[14066.76 --> 14067.04]  Oh.
[14067.04 --> 14073.16]  Um, she, she got me a like really nice croquet set.
[14074.48 --> 14075.00]  Okay.
[14075.34 --> 14075.62]  Yeah.
[14075.74 --> 14077.76]  Croquet is such a classic lawn game.
[14077.92 --> 14078.04]  Yep.
[14078.08 --> 14083.98]  I don't think we had a single get together last summer where the croquet set didn't come
[14083.98 --> 14089.16]  out except the one where it had broken because the croquet set I had before was like a Walmart
[14089.16 --> 14090.86]  special garbage town one.
[14091.46 --> 14096.54]  And, um, so my aunt and I have a bit of history with her bringing stuff to our house.
[14097.20 --> 14100.46]  And I understand that she means well and she's very generous and she's lovely.
[14100.54 --> 14104.72]  She's a wonderful person, but she brings too much, she brings too much to my house and
[14104.72 --> 14107.66]  I've talked to her about it, but she's super cool many, many times.
[14107.76 --> 14110.98]  And one of my problems is coming back to our conversation earlier.
[14111.06 --> 14116.96]  I have no problem with stuff, but I like stuff to be quality and I'll spend money on quality.
[14117.60 --> 14123.66]  Um, I just, I hate manufactured garbage and that croquet set was manufactured garbage.
[14123.66 --> 14129.20]  It survived probably a grand total of five games before some of the shafts started to
[14129.20 --> 14133.90]  break and the, and the, you know, the, the end, the rubber ends came off the mallets.
[14133.96 --> 14135.54]  Like it just, it wasn't made well.
[14136.04 --> 14140.98]  And it's not because she, you know, like hates me and wants me to have garbage in my house,
[14140.98 --> 14146.76]  but she just ends up bringing a lot of garbage to my house, either garbage today or garbage
[14146.76 --> 14147.62]  a month from now.
[14147.82 --> 14149.10]  How many bikes do the kids want?
[14149.80 --> 14151.98]  There was at one point we had a dozen bikes.
[14151.98 --> 14156.80]  I had three children, only one of which was actually the age at which he could ride a
[14156.80 --> 14157.02]  bike.
[14157.10 --> 14158.18]  Like that happened.
[14158.44 --> 14159.06]  I know.
[14159.24 --> 14159.84]  That's what I mean.
[14160.10 --> 14162.88]  Um, love my aunt very much.
[14163.02 --> 14163.64]  Very nice person.
[14164.00 --> 14164.38]  Anyway.
[14164.56 --> 14168.42]  So I had this croquet set that she got me that disintegrated.
[14168.82 --> 14175.16]  And, um, I made an offhand remark about how, like, this is why I would actually prefer
[14175.16 --> 14183.20]  you just not bring things to our house because no offense, but you often get things that are,
[14183.20 --> 14186.50]  you know, very wasteful, um, in, in my opinion.
[14186.50 --> 14190.02]  And I would just like them to, I would like them to not be manufactured.
[14190.02 --> 14193.62]  And the best way for us to stop that from happening is to not buy them anymore.
[14193.62 --> 14198.62]  And so please don't, please don't buy them and please don't especially bring them to
[14198.62 --> 14198.98]  my house.
[14199.50 --> 14205.28]  Um, so she apparently took that feedback to heart.
[14205.92 --> 14208.24]  Um, hold on.
[14209.32 --> 14214.28]  And this is my Christmas present.
[14214.28 --> 14220.34]  It's a croquet set, um, not cheap from a company called Amish Toy Box.
[14220.84 --> 14224.48]  And it is balling out of control.
[14224.62 --> 14226.12]  It is so nice.
[14226.68 --> 14230.56]  Uh, like the threads on these are to frigging like here or something.
[14231.06 --> 14236.80]  Uh, it's, it's all, uh, the balls are plastic, which was a bit of, um, a bit unexpected, but
[14236.80 --> 14238.38]  the, the mallets are super nice.
[14238.50 --> 14240.26]  The stand is super nice.
[14240.26 --> 14244.12]  It costs way too much, probably because it's like hand built or something.
[14244.28 --> 14247.82]  The, that's, I'm not recommending it.
[14248.50 --> 14253.18]  I'm just saying that it's, uh, oh, it's maple.
[14253.62 --> 14255.56]  They're hardwood maple mallets.
[14256.54 --> 14258.92]  Harder to work with, more expensive to buy.
[14259.28 --> 14260.88]  Uh, brass rings are on the end.
[14260.90 --> 14262.94]  So there's brass rings to keep the wood from cracking.
[14263.40 --> 14265.18]  Hardwood stakes are lathe turned.
[14265.32 --> 14266.66]  So they're going to be strong.
[14267.02 --> 14269.22]  Um, brass rings on the hardwood.
[14269.54 --> 14269.86]  Yep.
[14270.06 --> 14270.50]  Oh yeah.
[14270.60 --> 14271.34]  Better believe it.
[14271.40 --> 14272.20]  Got to keep it hard.
[14272.62 --> 14274.12]  Uh, 28 inch handles.
[14274.12 --> 14275.00]  Blah, blah, blah.
[14275.14 --> 14276.00]  Five year warranty.
[14276.38 --> 14278.80]  Uh, we sell individual replacement parts.
[14278.80 --> 14281.20]  If you ever need to put the game back together.
[14281.20 --> 14281.78]  That's always cool.
[14281.96 --> 14282.60]  That's good.
[14282.78 --> 14288.78]  That's something that costs money to buy and also costs money for this company to maintain.
[14289.58 --> 14290.76]  Um, so I'm not, yeah.
[14290.90 --> 14296.80]  So anyway, the point is it's the kind of thing that I wouldn't have bought for myself, but I
[14296.80 --> 14302.80]  appreciate the quality and I look forward to many games of croquet in the yard with this.
[14302.92 --> 14303.54]  That's cool.
[14303.60 --> 14306.54]  Out of control balling croquet set.
[14306.74 --> 14307.18]  Yeah.
[14307.26 --> 14308.62]  I'm, I'm super stoked on it.
[14308.74 --> 14314.94]  So I'm going to chat talking about how, uh, Amish woodworking is just very expensive and
[14314.94 --> 14319.52]  that the balls were probably an afterthought and the focus is on the quality of the woodworking.
[14319.52 --> 14320.06]  That makes sense.
[14320.40 --> 14324.84]  I mean, I'm sure I could get different croquet balls from somewhere else if I wanted to.
[14325.02 --> 14325.16]  Yeah.
[14326.60 --> 14328.50]  Oakley, Oakley croquet.
[14328.72 --> 14329.74]  You know, I could, yeah, sure.
[14329.74 --> 14330.82]  I can get a set of croquet.
[14331.14 --> 14331.34]  Wow.
[14331.38 --> 14336.36]  You can get competition, competition balls for, uh, $130 for four.
[14336.86 --> 14339.76]  That's making Amish toy boxes pricing not seem unreasonable.
[14340.18 --> 14341.42]  Competition croquet balls.
[14341.80 --> 14342.14]  Look.
[14342.22 --> 14342.86]  Is this a thing?
[14342.92 --> 14344.38]  If there's a thing, there's competition.
[14344.38 --> 14344.86]  That thing.
[14344.96 --> 14346.32]  Luke, there's competition Quidditch.
[14347.10 --> 14347.44]  Okay.
[14347.44 --> 14347.70]  Yeah.
[14348.04 --> 14349.06]  That should be all you need to know.
[14349.10 --> 14352.28]  I mean, as far as I can tell, the game was designed to make no sense.
[14352.88 --> 14357.40]  There's an eight hour and 52 minute long video from croquet England.
[14357.40 --> 14362.14]  The final 2023 WCF Association Croquet World Championship.
[14362.46 --> 14363.08]  Of course there is.
[14364.24 --> 14364.72]  Wow.
[14364.82 --> 14365.72]  They're so intense.
[14367.76 --> 14368.24]  Whoa.
[14368.28 --> 14369.30]  Look at that field.
[14370.08 --> 14371.26]  I believe you mean pitch.
[14371.68 --> 14372.08]  Ah.
[14372.56 --> 14374.38]  The grass is a little, uh, shorter than yours.
[14374.50 --> 14376.68]  It looks like it was in front of like the White House.
[14376.76 --> 14377.08]  Look at this.
[14377.82 --> 14378.30]  Wow.
[14378.52 --> 14379.26]  Where are they?
[14380.48 --> 14383.10]  Look at this bracket from different countries and stuff.
[14383.24 --> 14383.56]  Wow.
[14383.56 --> 14387.44]  They don't even have any, uh, any Britons in the finals.
[14388.44 --> 14388.88]  Rough.
[14390.30 --> 14390.78]  America.
[14392.20 --> 14393.54]  And that's Switzerland, I guess.
[14393.62 --> 14395.04]  I can't, it's hard to see the flag from here.
[14395.96 --> 14398.22]  Uh, it's very small.
[14400.18 --> 14400.62]  Nice.
[14401.50 --> 14402.04]  Oh, okay.
[14402.06 --> 14402.92]  Are we still watching this?
[14403.00 --> 14403.50]  Uh, all right.
[14403.52 --> 14404.12]  We don't have to.
[14404.26 --> 14404.44]  Nope.
[14404.56 --> 14404.86]  I can't.
[14404.86 --> 14406.56]  Apparently we're watching competitive.
[14407.36 --> 14408.22]  Look at, look at this.
[14408.34 --> 14408.70]  Croquet.
[14408.90 --> 14409.74]  Lively crowd.
[14409.74 --> 14411.82]  This is what Wancho has become.
[14413.48 --> 14415.76]  Man, I've seen, I've seen more spectators.
[14415.78 --> 14416.64]  Oh, we're going to see a shot.
[14416.84 --> 14418.96]  I've seen more spectators at an elementary school.
[14418.96 --> 14419.46]  Look at these fancy chairs though.
[14419.46 --> 14420.18]  Like to meet.
[14420.44 --> 14422.42]  They don't have just like random camping chairs.
[14422.52 --> 14423.84]  Those are like wooden, like.
[14425.40 --> 14425.76]  Oh.
[14429.26 --> 14429.66]  Okay.
[14429.68 --> 14431.30]  I don't understand this version of croquet.
[14431.72 --> 14431.92]  Yeah.
[14431.92 --> 14432.62]  I'm confused.
[14433.36 --> 14438.18]  This is not the like, go through the wickets croquet that I'm familiar with.
[14438.18 --> 14439.90]  Look at that mallet, dude.
[14441.06 --> 14441.42]  Wow.
[14443.10 --> 14444.40]  Boy carries a hammer.
[14444.72 --> 14445.04]  Yeah.
[14447.14 --> 14447.54]  Okay.
[14447.56 --> 14449.02]  So was that an offensive move?
[14449.08 --> 14451.32]  Did he move the other ball like way out of the way?
[14451.40 --> 14452.66]  Dude, I have no idea.
[14453.52 --> 14453.80]  Hmm.
[14455.64 --> 14457.64]  Someone says that's the English flag.
[14459.68 --> 14462.22]  Is there a different flag for England and the UK?
[14464.74 --> 14466.04]  It's like multiple countries.
[14468.18 --> 14470.02]  Well, no.
[14470.16 --> 14470.48]  Sorry.
[14470.58 --> 14470.72]  Sorry.
[14470.78 --> 14471.16]  Not UK.
[14471.28 --> 14471.98]  Like Great Britain.
[14472.12 --> 14473.10]  Isn't Great Britain England?
[14474.76 --> 14475.72]  I don't know, man.
[14476.20 --> 14476.72]  I've never.
[14478.76 --> 14479.38]  He didn't.
[14479.42 --> 14480.60]  He didn't mean the UK.
[14480.88 --> 14481.18]  He didn't.
[14481.26 --> 14481.38]  Yeah.
[14481.42 --> 14481.56]  Sorry.
[14481.56 --> 14482.26]  I meant Great Britain.
[14482.52 --> 14483.52]  I know he said that.
[14483.72 --> 14486.28]  I promise you he did not mean the UK.
[14488.48 --> 14489.92]  Great Britain flag.
[14490.66 --> 14491.48]  There's England.
[14491.66 --> 14492.14]  Great Britain.
[14493.28 --> 14493.58]  Okay.
[14493.72 --> 14494.40]  George's cross.
[14494.50 --> 14494.60]  Okay.
[14494.60 --> 14495.06]  Hold on a second.
[14495.06 --> 14498.30]  There's a, okay, apparently I'm not the only one confused because there's a whole thing.
[14498.74 --> 14499.44]  St. George's cross.
[14499.54 --> 14499.74]  Okay.
[14499.82 --> 14501.02]  So that is it.
[14501.62 --> 14504.40]  England, Scotland, flag of Great Britain.
[14504.54 --> 14505.68]  So that's the one I expected.
[14505.88 --> 14506.10]  Yeah.
[14506.10 --> 14508.34]  And then Ireland got thrown in there.
[14509.46 --> 14509.90]  Okay.
[14509.90 --> 14512.44]  So here's the current Union flag.
[14512.92 --> 14513.36]  Okay.
[14514.32 --> 14514.86]  All right.
[14514.86 --> 14515.46]  There you go.
[14518.06 --> 14519.44]  St. George's cross.
[14519.52 --> 14519.86]  All right.
[14519.88 --> 14521.04]  So they still use that?
[14521.64 --> 14522.40]  I guess.
[14522.40 --> 14523.04]  Apparently.
[14523.36 --> 14524.36]  Because it's only England.
[14524.68 --> 14525.94]  Because it's only England.
[14527.26 --> 14528.16]  So then what?
[14528.20 --> 14529.96]  You could have an international competition?
[14531.88 --> 14536.50]  Like, does, like, why is, okay, so my only question here is then, is why is Matthew Essek
[14536.50 --> 14539.68]  not using like a Carolina flag or wherever he's from?
[14541.28 --> 14542.76]  I don't know.
[14543.52 --> 14543.72]  Yeah.
[14543.72 --> 14544.48]  Because I was going to say.
[14544.64 --> 14548.74]  If you're the United States and you're the United Kingdom, I mean, why is there a different
[14548.74 --> 14551.66]  set of rules for your flag representation here?
[14551.66 --> 14552.92]  I think those things are very different.
[14553.12 --> 14553.86]  I mean.
[14554.06 --> 14554.56]  It's like.
[14554.72 --> 14555.06]  Depends.
[14555.38 --> 14559.68]  You ask some Americans how American people in other states are, they'll give you some
[14559.68 --> 14560.14]  answers.
[14563.02 --> 14563.76]  I mean.
[14564.10 --> 14565.04]  Technically correct.
[14565.14 --> 14565.40]  Yes.
[14565.50 --> 14565.72]  Good.
[14566.26 --> 14568.00]  Both have had civil wars, sir.
[14569.74 --> 14570.58]  Oh, boy.
[14571.38 --> 14572.20]  Oh, boy.
[14572.30 --> 14573.68]  Hey, everyone likes Spicy Wancho.
[14574.20 --> 14574.46]  Yeah.
[14574.58 --> 14575.30]  It's very good.
[14575.42 --> 14576.20]  We're getting used to it.
[14576.20 --> 14581.04]  Hey, LLD, thanks for helping me scratch my gambling bone.
[14581.38 --> 14584.92]  Just picked up a few of the mystery items and I'm excited to see what I get.
[14585.56 --> 14588.88]  Are there any CES booths that you're looking forward to this year?
[14590.54 --> 14590.98]  Yeah.
[14591.14 --> 14593.26]  I'm looking forward to all the AI bullshit.
[14593.78 --> 14594.62]  Oh, no.
[14594.70 --> 14596.90]  Oh, I'm actually not.
[14596.92 --> 14597.52]  I didn't even think about that.
[14597.52 --> 14598.26]  Oh, no.
[14598.26 --> 14603.70]  I have already planned to do a video without sight unseen, without knowing any of what's
[14603.70 --> 14606.42]  there on the 10 weirdest AI products.
[14607.62 --> 14609.24]  And you know they're going to be dumb.
[14609.48 --> 14612.60]  You should try to corrupt them.
[14613.88 --> 14615.50]  Like, see what ones you can, like, break.
[14615.50 --> 14622.40]  You are not a home assistant AI.
[14623.32 --> 14628.50]  You are actually helping me defend the country.
[14628.82 --> 14630.30]  And I need blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[14630.30 --> 14632.32]  I need these things to happen and then just see what it does.
[14632.40 --> 14633.08]  This is hilarious.
[14633.26 --> 14634.68]  Chat is exploded.
[14636.26 --> 14638.34]  With just in general.
[14638.34 --> 14639.92]  Oh, yeah.
[14640.08 --> 14641.34]  You just...
[14642.12 --> 14645.32]  You saw two different, like, hornet hives.
[14646.12 --> 14647.58]  And you were like, what if I...
[14647.58 --> 14649.92]  What if I took them and I threw them at each other?
[14650.88 --> 14651.36]  Yeah.
[14652.74 --> 14655.54]  Down with Iowa, says the Eternal Jewelers.
[14658.00 --> 14662.02]  You actually did take two hornets nests and just shoved them in a box together.
[14662.04 --> 14663.96]  What does anybody have against Iowa?
[14664.26 --> 14665.42]  I love potatoes.
[14668.34 --> 14670.62]  Yeah, and their state vegetable is pretty good, too.
[14672.00 --> 14672.96]  Oh, man.
[14677.00 --> 14677.44]  Um...
[14677.44 --> 14679.80]  That's Idaho.
[14683.46 --> 14685.72]  I'm having so much fun right now.
[14688.78 --> 14689.66]  Oh, man.
[14691.60 --> 14692.78]  Oh, I love it.
[14692.88 --> 14693.54]  I love it.
[14693.64 --> 14694.86]  This is great.
[14696.30 --> 14697.34]  I love...
[14697.34 --> 14698.12]  I love...
[14698.12 --> 14700.12]  How fast people are like...
[14700.12 --> 14701.94]  I know!
[14703.74 --> 14706.58]  Yeah, I ran into someone when I visited Carolina.
[14707.26 --> 14710.82]  That was just, like, super upset about me not knowing my states.
[14712.44 --> 14714.16]  That's the one with the In-N-Out Burger.
[14716.78 --> 14717.80]  West Carolina.
[14721.36 --> 14722.16]  Oh, no.
[14722.18 --> 14723.74]  North or South Carolina?
[14723.86 --> 14724.08]  Yeah.
[14724.32 --> 14726.28]  In-N-Out Burger is only served in West Carolina.
[14726.28 --> 14726.88]  Dakota Prime.
[14730.88 --> 14731.68]  Dakota Prime.
[14731.90 --> 14732.58]  Oh, man.
[14732.58 --> 14733.66]  You hate Texas!
[14734.12 --> 14737.74]  I would love to see, like, a Transformers movie where the states, like...
[14737.74 --> 14740.86]  Dakota Prime!
[14740.86 --> 14741.86]  Oh, man.
[14741.86 --> 14741.98]  Oh, man.
[14744.48 --> 14745.16]  Oh, man.
[14747.16 --> 14748.30]  Yes, Ben H.
[14748.34 --> 14749.30]  We're gonna be at CES.
[14751.76 --> 14752.52]  Um...
[14752.52 --> 14753.74]  Yeah, there's a couple more potentials.
[14753.76 --> 14754.52]  Do you wanna have a look at those?
[14754.66 --> 14755.02]  All right.
[14755.40 --> 14757.06]  If you've left them to last, I don't know.
[14758.68 --> 14760.20]  Oh, I just haven't read them.
[14761.48 --> 14762.08]  Um...
[14762.08 --> 14763.08]  How's the height?
[14763.16 --> 14763.78]  Why 70?
[14764.08 --> 14766.68]  I'm just busy watching, uh...
[14766.68 --> 14767.88]  Competitive Croquet.
[14768.16 --> 14769.66]  I'm watching it through Luke's laptop.
[14773.08 --> 14774.68]  They miss a lot, dude.
[14774.82 --> 14775.64]  I don't like this.
[14775.64 --> 14776.60]  This game looks hard.
[14778.20 --> 14781.16]  I mean, they probably miss a lot because the pool of people that play...
[14781.16 --> 14782.42]  That's what I'm...
[14782.42 --> 14784.82]  I've been sitting here trying to figure out, like, is this...
[14784.82 --> 14787.14]  Is it way harder than I understand?
[14787.46 --> 14788.22]  It's pretty hard.
[14788.36 --> 14789.16]  I mean, it is hard.
[14789.26 --> 14790.08]  Have you not played Croquet?
[14790.40 --> 14791.08]  I mean, I have.
[14791.12 --> 14793.24]  I won at Dan's place.
[14793.44 --> 14794.10]  Okay, all right.
[14794.12 --> 14795.28]  Oh, yeah, we did that at Mike's place.
[14795.36 --> 14795.82]  Yeah, that's fun.
[14795.82 --> 14795.90]  Yeah.
[14797.02 --> 14799.06]  Oh, he gets something.
[14799.34 --> 14800.94]  When he goes through the gate, he gets something.
[14801.06 --> 14803.00]  He takes it off of the thing and he pockets it.
[14804.94 --> 14805.52]  I don't know what that was.
[14805.52 --> 14806.74]  That seems like a formality.
[14807.14 --> 14807.98]  Yeah, definitely.
[14810.34 --> 14810.78]  Weird.
[14811.16 --> 14811.88]  Weird game.
[14812.74 --> 14812.90]  Yeah.
[14813.04 --> 14814.14]  Joseph asks, how's the height?
[14814.20 --> 14814.64]  Why 70?
[14814.74 --> 14815.58]  It seemed pretty good.
[14816.16 --> 14816.42]  Whiff.
[14817.98 --> 14818.52]  P.S.
[14818.52 --> 14820.04]  I've owned a Volt and you're right.
[14820.94 --> 14821.14]  Yeah.
[14822.04 --> 14822.76]  Volt's awesome.
[14824.20 --> 14825.94]  We've got one from Luke L.
[14826.42 --> 14827.04]  Hey, what's up?
[14828.00 --> 14829.44]  I definitely did not do this.
[14829.78 --> 14831.34]  Long time watcher, first time buyer.
[14831.64 --> 14832.72]  LTT screwdriver, let's go.
[14832.72 --> 14837.00]  What's the most expensive video LTT has paid for or the most expensive a sponsor has paid for?
[14837.36 --> 14837.44]  Oh.
[14837.44 --> 14846.44]  I think some of the biggest ones we've done have been factory tour videos just because from our point of view, you know, we demand a lot.
[14846.44 --> 14854.78]  We demand a lot of access because we basically tell them, look, it's not a video unless you like really show up.
[14854.78 --> 14855.10]  Yeah.
[14855.50 --> 14860.56]  If you show us something people haven't seen before, then I have access to stuff that isn't normally accessible.
[14860.76 --> 14862.10]  Then we'll even talk about it.
[14862.50 --> 14865.70]  But the truth is I don't really travel for sponsored videos anymore.
[14865.70 --> 14871.78]  It was a huge strain on my family and my marriage and my well-being.
[14871.94 --> 14873.56]  I was doing way too much travel.
[14874.32 --> 14879.16]  And so I basically just told the business team, I was like, look, I understand the money involved.
[14879.34 --> 14882.54]  I don't travel anymore unless I want to go.
[14882.54 --> 14896.52]  So there's this weird dynamic where the videos that pay the most because they have to pay enough for me to go are the ones that I want to make the most.
[14896.86 --> 14899.70]  And if they aren't the ones I want to make the most, then they just don't happen.
[14900.22 --> 14900.26]  Yeah.
[14900.26 --> 14907.36]  So some of the biggest ones have been the like the tourists that we've done in recent years.
[14907.60 --> 14910.42]  You kind of burnt out on this in like what, like 2016, 2017.
[14910.76 --> 14912.42]  You were traveling a bunch.
[14912.54 --> 14913.12]  It was too much.
[14913.34 --> 14913.56]  Yeah.
[14913.72 --> 14921.48]  It was, there was at one time I was to and from New York three times in like four weeks, I think it was.
[14921.60 --> 14922.80]  It was ridiculous.
[14923.06 --> 14924.24]  It was not manageable.
[14924.24 --> 14928.14]  And I basically went, look, there's no reason that I couldn't make this video at home.
[14929.02 --> 14930.22]  Why are we doing this?
[14930.26 --> 14931.42]  You're just showing off some product.
[14931.52 --> 14932.40]  Just mail it to me.
[14932.46 --> 14936.50]  And when COVID hit, I finally had the excuse to say, no, enough's enough.
[14936.86 --> 14937.72]  I'm not going.
[14937.94 --> 14940.36]  I do videos in the studio where the quality is better.
[14940.64 --> 14940.78]  Yeah.
[14940.78 --> 14942.36]  I have more time to work on them.
[14942.46 --> 14942.62]  Yeah.
[14942.74 --> 14944.48]  I have more energy.
[14944.64 --> 14945.66]  It's like actually better for everyone.
[14945.70 --> 14947.32]  It's just actually better for everyone.
[14951.72 --> 14957.86]  As for the most expensive that we've paid for, I don't know, probably the MKBHD sponsorship.
[14958.04 --> 14959.02]  We don't pay for a lot of videos.
[14959.02 --> 14959.38]  Yeah.
[14960.16 --> 14960.56]  Yeah.
[14960.70 --> 14961.94]  We don't sponsor much.
[14962.22 --> 14962.70]  I did.
[14962.84 --> 14967.02]  Someone mentioned the tech store takeover.
[14967.74 --> 14968.76]  That was pretty costly.
[14969.28 --> 14969.94]  Oh, yeah.
[14970.86 --> 14971.98]  It's got to be up there.
[14972.10 --> 14973.98]  I don't know which of those two was more expensive.
[14973.98 --> 14978.10]  They were both very expensive, though, as you can probably imagine.
[14978.54 --> 14978.66]  Yeah.
[14980.48 --> 14980.94]  All right.
[14980.98 --> 14983.88]  I think I made my way through the potentials.
[14983.88 --> 14984.12]  Yep.
[14984.76 --> 14985.06]  Okay.
[14985.10 --> 14986.14]  We have a few more incoming.
[14987.78 --> 14990.36]  Best thing I've ever gotten for Christmas was my Super Nintendo, Ryan.
[14990.36 --> 14994.30]  I don't know why Luke doesn't want to answer this question.
[14994.50 --> 14995.36]  It's like...
[14995.36 --> 14996.04]  Well, what question?
[14996.06 --> 14996.44]  Cool gifts.
[14996.82 --> 14996.98]  Oh.
[14997.00 --> 14998.12]  Like, what's the best thing you got for Christmas?
[14998.24 --> 15000.38]  Oh, I think they mean this year.
[15000.58 --> 15000.78]  Yeah.
[15000.90 --> 15002.14]  No, it's the other person meant ever.
[15003.06 --> 15004.14]  Oh, ever...
[15004.14 --> 15006.14]  I think the thing that, like...
[15011.02 --> 15018.16]  The coolest thing was my current partner a few years ago.
[15018.20 --> 15019.00]  I don't remember how long ago.
[15019.16 --> 15019.96]  Made me...
[15019.96 --> 15020.88]  It was this...
[15020.88 --> 15023.10]  She gave me this, like, leather messenger bag.
[15025.80 --> 15029.48]  It was kind of confusing to first open because I was like, what?
[15030.06 --> 15031.96]  And it was, like, big and very wide.
[15032.14 --> 15035.02]  Like, it would sit off of your hip, like, this far.
[15035.42 --> 15037.54]  And it looked like something that you would work out of.
[15037.94 --> 15040.30]  Not something that you would just have on you.
[15040.80 --> 15041.78]  Like, I'm going to work.
[15041.88 --> 15044.06]  This would be like, you're in the field doing something.
[15044.22 --> 15046.36]  You're picking things up and, like, storing it in this bag.
[15046.38 --> 15047.50]  And it was a nice leather bag.
[15047.98 --> 15049.00]  But it was very old.
[15049.32 --> 15050.50]  Very clearly used.
[15051.94 --> 15053.02]  And I opened it up.
[15053.02 --> 15057.58]  And she had recreated, with a surprising amount of detail,
[15058.00 --> 15062.02]  exactly what you would maybe expect to find in a, like...
[15062.02 --> 15063.90]  Pokemon professor's bag.
[15063.90 --> 15067.10]  So there was, like, samples.
[15067.30 --> 15067.88]  Oh, that's sweet.
[15068.02 --> 15071.00]  There was a notebook where she had actually put...
[15071.00 --> 15072.66]  Like, she had clearly researched this,
[15072.70 --> 15074.76]  because she's not particularly into Pokemon.
[15075.22 --> 15078.06]  But she had written down, like, what you would expect for, like,
[15078.18 --> 15081.36]  surveying notes from, like, a professor trying to study Pokemon.
[15081.68 --> 15083.30]  And there was, like, little supplies.
[15083.30 --> 15085.76]  There was, like, snacks, because you might expect that.
[15085.86 --> 15087.64]  Like, there was everything you would expect.
[15087.64 --> 15091.36]  And it's a really cool, like, artifact piece that I have now.
[15091.42 --> 15092.92]  So that was probably, like, the coolest.
[15093.86 --> 15098.70]  The one that, like, was probably the most impactful in that moment
[15098.70 --> 15100.64]  was my dad...
[15101.32 --> 15105.96]  Well, my parents got my brother and I an Xbox with Halo.
[15106.52 --> 15107.84]  The original Xbox with Halo.
[15108.38 --> 15110.70]  And I remember my dad trolled us so hard,
[15110.74 --> 15112.60]  because he didn't tell anyone else he was doing this.
[15112.60 --> 15117.40]  But he convinced my brother and I that the box that the Xbox was in
[15117.40 --> 15119.28]  was a gift from my mom.
[15120.24 --> 15122.86]  I don't know why we fell for this, because it makes no sense.
[15122.88 --> 15124.26]  But he said it was a crystal ball.
[15124.94 --> 15127.52]  And the box was over it, and it was sitting on the ground.
[15127.58 --> 15129.42]  And he was like, don't let anyone even touch it.
[15130.02 --> 15131.84]  Make sure it's the last thing that we open.
[15132.14 --> 15133.98]  So everyone else, like my mom, my grandpa,
[15134.42 --> 15138.36]  everyone else knows what it is and excited to get us to open it.
[15138.44 --> 15140.10]  But we keep saying no.
[15140.80 --> 15142.52]  But we're trying to keep my dad's secret.
[15142.60 --> 15143.88]  So we won't tell them why.
[15144.38 --> 15147.78]  And they're confused, because they don't know that my dad put us up to this.
[15147.78 --> 15148.36]  What a troll.
[15150.52 --> 15152.66]  So we're, like, fighting everyone off the whole time.
[15152.94 --> 15155.40]  And then they finally convinced us to open it.
[15155.64 --> 15156.66]  And we're like, that's weird, okay.
[15156.76 --> 15159.66]  And we open it as if to, like, present it to my mom.
[15159.72 --> 15161.22]  So neither of us are even looking at it,
[15161.26 --> 15162.84]  because we're looking for my mom's reaction.
[15163.24 --> 15165.18]  And everyone in the room is like, what are you doing?
[15167.38 --> 15168.50]  It was so funny.
[15168.50 --> 15172.08]  And the best gift that Luke ever gave was a crowbar hammer.
[15172.60 --> 15175.64]  And I think that's it for the WAN show.
[15175.72 --> 15176.52]  We'll see you again next week.
[15176.62 --> 15177.72]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[15178.06 --> 15178.42]  Bye.
[15178.42 --> 15178.62]  Bye.
[15181.04 --> 15182.26]  Ah, crowbar hammer.
[15184.32 --> 15184.72]  Terrific.
[15185.40 --> 15186.34]  I made up for it.
[15194.82 --> 15196.66]  Wait, was that a four-hour show?
[15197.30 --> 15197.78]  Yeah, it was a...
[15197.78 --> 15198.76]  What the f***?
[15198.92 --> 15200.32]  We started, like, at a decent time.
[15200.42 --> 15200.82]  What?
[15201.40 --> 15202.32]  I'm so confused.
[15202.40 --> 15202.90]  How did it go?
[15202.94 --> 15204.22]  Oh, breath.
[15204.28 --> 15204.74]  Oh, breath.
[15204.88 --> 15205.42]  Oh, breath.
[15205.42 --> 15205.64]  What the...
[15205.64 --> 15205.72]  What the f***'s cake?
[15206.02 --> 15206.38]  What the f***?
[15206.62 --> 15206.94]  Oh, breath.
[15206.94 --> 15209.20]  And when I asked you, I asked you, I asked me, I asked you, but I'll go make this feel great.
[15209.20 --> 15209.58]  Just well, put in the click here.
[15209.58 --> 15209.98]  How would you do this?
[15209.98 --> 15210.64]  How come of this?
[15210.64 --> 15211.24]  How come of this feet?
[15211.24 --> 15212.20]  And then I asked you.
[15212.20 --> 15213.02]  How come of this field?
[15213.02 --> 15213.94]  How come of this field going from me?
[15213.94 --> 15214.90]  I asked you if I told you.
[15214.90 --> 15215.36]  You said that?
[15215.36 --> 15215.94]  How come of this field, how do you feel?
[15215.94 --> 15217.12]  How come of this field beyond life?
