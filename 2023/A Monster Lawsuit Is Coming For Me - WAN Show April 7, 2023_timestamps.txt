Don't have time for 5 hour WAN shows (if you do you need to sort your lives out)
Timestamp guy > view.

Streamed 2 days ago ,no timestamps. How many employees you got again ?

probably a bad take but Normaly a corporate Channel should not include any Private videos of the CEO, especially the CEO playing with his children. its a Corporate Channel of a actual company and not Linus Private family Video archive, you wanna share links to videos to family and friends? just use google drive its not like you dont want to load private stuff into the Google Ecosphere or else the private videos of your children wouldn't be up in Youtube.
Linus also said recently that he is aware that YT ContentID is also checking up on private and hidden videos, having any content of children that could be falsely flagged is actually a liability for the channel. the probability might now be even higher as YT might index it when it resurfaces on other YT Channels that might have a history, it wouldn't even be that off brand of youtube to be that aggressive about it.. you guys remember how YT reacted when they found out that the CP club was posting timestamp links in comments on videos including children?? like a pevert spider web with its connection points to content that seems pretty harmles by itself but based on reports showed to many pantys and stuff, yeah thats why any content including children or made for children nowadays has a auto deactivated comment section.
the problem i see here is that linus still thinks he isn't corporate while being or becoming fully corporate, even yt wanted to switch him over from a creator representative to a corporate one as he told us.
I can understand how it will make a father angry to know people have copies and backups that include videos of his children and i condem anyone saving the videos of his Children with unsavory intentions in mind.
the normal internet historians and datahoarders just dont care that much they just collect stuff and probably not even looking it trough, if they do i can see them actually delete the children videos to get more space for stuff they care about.
I can see how the personal emotional involvement can skew  a view on a topic compared to previous iterations, especially under the light that he still sees himself as a small private creator and not as as CEO and face of a Company with a dozen subbrands, a approximate Net Worth of 85 $million based on recent estimates and enough employees that he sometimes loses track how many there actually are.
in the end its just hypocrisy to say if people download and privateer leaks of other companies it's ok because they are companies! but if they do it with LTT Leaks that suff i see as Private and its evil and i am gonna call you names! 
It also feels to me like he plays it like the entire leak to only contain videos of his children and not be mostly some cut stuff and test video files and hidden reviews, but that might just be the the bad faith in me talking ;)
Just keep private videos out of that company account in the future and be aware that if you had done it like that from the getgo there would be not videos of your children on the open internet.

If "Monster energy" doesn't want confusion ... they could have chosen a less generic name for their product. Prior use & popularity of the word. Can Disney sue Monster Energy for use of "Monster" & green color? Timestamp 7:20, good for small biz having a good defense.

TIMESTAMPS GUY:

5 hours ? FVCK THAT!

[2023-04-08T13:26:14Z] Video: A Monster Lawsuit Is Coming For Me - WAN Show April 7, 2023 
5 hours?!! No wonder the timestamp guy retired.

[2023-04-08T13:18:38Z] Video: A Monster Lawsuit Is Coming For Me - WAN Show April 7, 2023 
5 hours 16 minutes, are you kidding me? The sheer arrogance of thinking you can monopolise our time and still relying on the community to do the timestamps for you for free, because it's beneath you. Just admit you can't be bothered.

[2023-04-08T08:45:59Z] Video: A Monster Lawsuit Is Coming For Me - WAN Show April 7, 2023 
5h without timestamps? Pssssh, no thanks.

I am sad for the loss of my favorite show. 2 hours was perfect, 3 was borderline, 4 was a chore. With 5 hours I won't even check the timestamps anymore. I hope me not watching is going to contribute to their metrics going down, which is the only way they will ever consider going back :(
