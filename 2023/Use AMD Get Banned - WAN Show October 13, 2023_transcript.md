[0.00 --> 4.24]  What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show!
[4.24 --> 7.24]  We got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[7.24 --> 11.12]  Account locking devices sucks.
[11.12 --> 12.20]  Not a real topic.
[12.20 --> 14.00]  All I have is a link to something.
[14.00 --> 16.12]  So we're all going to discover it together.
[16.12 --> 23.40]  And AMD users could be banned in Counter Strike 2 just for using a feature of AMD's
[23.40 --> 24.40]  drivers.
[24.40 --> 27.40]  Um, uh oh.
[27.40 --> 28.40]  What else we got?
[28.40 --> 30.20]  Just because he stole my topic.
[30.20 --> 31.20]  I did!
[31.20 --> 32.60]  I'm gonna do it anyways.
[32.60 --> 36.20]  Uh, GitHub Copilot might be running at a loss.
[36.20 --> 39.20]  I talked about this literally last week.
[39.20 --> 39.70]  Nice.
[39.70 --> 41.00]  And now we have news about it.
[41.00 --> 42.20]  So that's cool.
[42.20 --> 44.20]  We'll see where that goes in a moment.
[44.20 --> 49.20]  And then the other one if I can find it is Google defaults to pass keys.
[49.20 --> 50.20]  Really?
[50.20 --> 53.20]  You picked that over PS5 Slim?
[53.20 --> 54.20]  Yeah, I don't care about that.
[54.20 --> 55.80]  Over Microsoft acquiring Activision?
[55.80 --> 57.20]  Yeah, we all knew that was coming.
[57.20 --> 59.00]  Ahhhh.
[59.00 --> 63.40]  Over Intel's new graphics card that everyone is so excited about?
[63.40 --> 64.40]  Wait, what?
[64.40 --> 65.80]  No, they're not excited.
[65.80 --> 66.40]  Oh.
[66.40 --> 67.40]  Let's roll the intro.
[67.40 --> 79.60]  the show is brought to you today by Kudos, Grammarly, and Maximum Settings.
[79.60 --> 80.80]  Not gonna lie.
[80.80 --> 81.80]  No idea what that is.
[81.80 --> 82.80]  We'll find out.
[82.80 --> 83.80]  I'll be finding out alongside you guys.
[83.80 --> 84.80]  Yeah.
[84.80 --> 86.00]  We'll find out.
[86.00 --> 91.00]  Let's go ahead and jump into our first topic today, which is that AMD users have the potential
[91.00 --> 99.20]  to be banned, like VAC banned from Counter-Strike 2 for enabling a feature in AMD's newest driver drop.
[99.20 --> 113.40]  AMD made their anti-leg plus feature available for Counter-Strike 2, which unfortunately is implemented by detouring engine DLL functions.
[113.40 --> 131.60]  So the idea here is that very similar to Nvidia's reflex technology, AMD anti-leg plus is designed to lower the overall system latency for a more responsive gaming experience.
[131.60 --> 156.60]  But, Valve actually tweeted, and this is from their official Counter-Strike handle, posted, tweeted, if you are an AMD customer and play CS2, do, this is in all caps, DO NOT ENABLE ANTILEG PLUS,
[156.60 --> 161.60]  PLUS, any tampering with CS code will result in a VAC ban.
[161.60 --> 170.60]  Once AMD ships an update, we can do the work of identifying affected users and reversing the ban, but it sounds like you will not be playing the game in the meantime.
[170.60 --> 183.60]  I'm glad that they did clarify that you will not necessarily be forever banned, lose your hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of skins or whatever else that people, but kids buy these days or whatever.
[183.60 --> 198.10]  Basically, the way that anti-leg works is it periodically checks if the CPU is ahead of the GPU, and if it is, it throttles the CPU to send fewer frames to the GPU for processing to reduce the load on it.
[198.40 --> 201.04]  This reduces the frame buffer, thus improving the latency.
[201.04 --> 208.02]  As far as I can tell, maybe the audience can correct us here, there is no current response from AMD.
[208.28 --> 211.36]  And this was posted by Valve at like 10 a.m. this morning.
[211.36 --> 215.48]  It is worth noting that I mentioned NVIDIA Reflex, right?
[215.80 --> 226.36]  Those users are not affected because according to what I've seen, which I think came from Valve, don't quote me on this part, but they implemented it the correct way.
[226.48 --> 233.52]  They've implemented it in the game as opposed to just as a driver feature that applies to the game.
[233.52 --> 244.32]  I have to say, I do wonder if Valve could have simply not VAC banned.
[244.48 --> 246.52]  Like, could they just...
[246.52 --> 248.90]  Do you think Valve's doing the right thing here?
[249.68 --> 251.48]  Do you mean like, is there a different way?
[251.68 --> 257.18]  Like, don't allow people to launch if they have this going on and just tell them that they have to go disable it?
[257.28 --> 259.90]  I didn't even think of that, but that's a great idea too.
[260.12 --> 261.80]  I feel like there's some other way around it.
[261.80 --> 269.10]  Yeah, if they know what AMD has changed and they're aware of it enough to send a tweet, is this something that they could handle a different way?
[269.24 --> 274.64]  Considering they tagged AMD in their tweet, I feel like this caught them off guard.
[275.96 --> 278.76]  Actually, yeah, this is all making no sense to me whatsoever.
[278.98 --> 280.08]  It's very weird behavior.
[280.20 --> 283.82]  Yeah, how would Valve not have high up contacts at AMD?
[284.22 --> 287.08]  If I'm AMD, I'm actually probably kind of ticked off right now.
[287.14 --> 287.40]  Yeah.
[287.40 --> 297.78]  Because this reflects poorly on our product, even if we didn't, strictly speaking, do anything wrong other than try to improve the experience for our users.
[298.00 --> 304.84]  But then again, maybe Valve's kind of teed off right now because AMD should tell them before making any changes to...
[304.84 --> 313.12]  I think Valve is getting a lot of negative press right now for CS2 in general, which we can talk about as a part of this topic.
[314.40 --> 317.54]  And maybe they're trying to shift some of that elsewhere.
[318.04 --> 318.76]  I don't know.
[318.76 --> 321.66]  That's just a potential idea.
[322.00 --> 323.64]  But this was very weird.
[323.64 --> 328.64]  Seeing it just blown up in a tweet, them tagging AMD directly...
[329.18 --> 333.94]  I don't know if it comes across as the most professional ever.
[334.18 --> 334.48]  Yeah.
[334.48 --> 335.04]  I'm not sure.
[335.16 --> 336.50]  I'm actually not really...
[336.50 --> 338.44]  I'm not really liking the way that they're handling this.
[338.44 --> 339.08]  Feels weird.
[339.30 --> 342.14]  And making it the problem of the user.
[343.42 --> 343.74]  Yeah.
[344.18 --> 350.76]  They do say, I think somewhere, yeah, once AMD ships an update, we can work on identifying affected users and reversing their ban.
[350.76 --> 355.84]  And so it sounds like they're going to try to fix it for people because, you know, not everyone has Twitter.
[356.58 --> 360.02]  And I haven't checked, but as far as I know, it's not telling people in the game.
[360.44 --> 362.74]  They just have to know from this tweet, basically.
[362.92 --> 366.38]  But then, okay, let's go the other way again.
[366.38 --> 378.30]  And then, I mean, from Valve's point of view, if you're mucking around with DLLs, then as a graphics card manufacturer and driver writer, should you know better than that?
[378.30 --> 383.42]  Should AMD have known better than to mess around with this for a competitive online game?
[383.80 --> 385.64]  Especially one that just launched.
[385.66 --> 387.82]  Very likely. I still think as Valve, I handle this differently.
[388.24 --> 391.02]  I still think you can even send that tweet out.
[392.18 --> 394.96]  But in a way, that's a little different, in my opinion.
[395.40 --> 398.30]  Yeah, I think that if they just basically said...
[398.30 --> 404.30]  Anytime you're using all caps, you probably need to just...
[405.30 --> 406.38]  Yeah.
[406.38 --> 415.50]  Do the, like, really big breathe in, pause, additional small breathe in, breathe out, go for a walk.
[415.54 --> 417.00]  He's going for a walk right now.
[417.54 --> 419.48]  Yep. He's literally going outside.
[419.84 --> 421.78]  I think he's attempting to touch grass.
[421.96 --> 424.24]  I think that's... Yep, he's touching grass right now.
[424.24 --> 425.02]  I have also witnessed this.
[425.02 --> 426.22]  He's actively touching grass.
[426.46 --> 427.74]  He has acquired grass.
[427.76 --> 429.10]  Oh, God, he's not going to make us touch it.
[429.10 --> 430.04]  And it's returning into the building.
[431.60 --> 432.70]  He touched grass.
[432.82 --> 433.32]  Okay, ew.
[433.46 --> 434.20]  Yep, yep.
[434.38 --> 435.94]  Then we take the caps lock off.
[436.38 --> 437.26]  And...
[437.26 --> 437.78]  Retype.
[437.80 --> 439.54]  Say whatever it is that we need to say.
[439.74 --> 439.92]  Yeah.
[441.42 --> 441.82]  Yeah.
[441.92 --> 444.36]  I would do well to take this advice.
[444.56 --> 445.44]  Yeah, yeah, maybe.
[446.70 --> 447.76]  Here and there, you know.
[447.76 --> 450.88]  But, yeah, it just, it seemed...
[450.88 --> 453.94]  I wouldn't give it an A plus as a response.
[455.94 --> 458.98]  But, yeah, I would like to see...
[458.98 --> 462.90]  And I think, you know, the, like, don't allow people to queue thing, if they have it?
[462.98 --> 470.82]  If they don't have that feature already, I think they're hoping that AMD would fix this before they would be able to roll it out.
[470.96 --> 471.14]  Yeah.
[471.14 --> 472.34]  So they're just trying to get ahead of it?
[472.34 --> 473.30]  And, like, if they...
[473.30 --> 474.20]  I don't know.
[474.28 --> 486.42]  I feel like if they can detect this change temporarily, you know, they could do something as simple, like you said, as not allowing people to queue and popping up an error message.
[486.68 --> 487.30]  I don't know.
[488.02 --> 490.32]  Can I change gears a little bit here, though?
[490.54 --> 490.80]  Mm-hmm.
[490.80 --> 493.84]  And say something positive about Counter-Strike 2?
[494.60 --> 495.62]  Have you played it?
[495.70 --> 496.28]  I played it.
[496.50 --> 496.76]  Okay.
[496.86 --> 497.18]  Sort of.
[497.52 --> 497.76]  Okay.
[498.20 --> 504.20]  I did some, like, practice stuff with it because I was working on a video and we needed some games for benchmarking.
[504.24 --> 506.58]  And everyone knows Counter-Strike is the best game benchmark.
[509.04 --> 512.46]  I am so excited to play Counter-Strike 2.
[514.66 --> 515.92]  Do you know why?
[516.22 --> 516.46]  No.
[516.46 --> 528.80]  Do you remember that, like, thing, that, like, tirade I launched into about how ridiculous, I think, non-random spray patterns are?
[529.62 --> 530.18]  Yeah.
[530.18 --> 536.68]  How it was clear to me that the intent of pseudo-random...
[536.68 --> 547.54]  The attempt to create randomness in recoil by just having sort of, like, a fixed thing was clearly a limitation of, like, early game design and not the designer's intent.
[547.54 --> 553.54]  And this whole thing where we just, like, memorize it and draw patterns with our mouse, to me is, like, it's...
[553.54 --> 560.10]  It's vestigial, in my opinion.
[560.20 --> 561.80]  And a lot of people disagree with me.
[561.82 --> 562.80]  And that's super cool.
[563.00 --> 565.62]  But it looks like Valve is on my side.
[566.70 --> 573.26]  There's a new crosshair in Counter-Strike 2 that just shows you where the bullet will actually go.
[573.62 --> 575.82]  And moves around according to the recoil pattern.
[575.92 --> 576.88]  It's built right into the game.
[576.88 --> 578.72]  It's like an adaptive crosshair.
[579.08 --> 587.68]  And I was only practicing on bots, but my time to kill was ridiculously low compared to what I've ever been able to achieve in that game.
[588.24 --> 592.00]  I am so excited to play it now.
[592.84 --> 593.30]  Really?
[593.50 --> 593.80]  Yeah.
[594.16 --> 599.32]  You don't have to just f***ing guess where the f*** your f***ing bullet is gonna go.
[599.64 --> 602.62]  It actually just shows you, like, a functioning crosshair.
[602.68 --> 605.52]  Even an iron sight would move.
[605.52 --> 609.52]  So if you can track it, then you can stay on it.
[610.80 --> 611.94]  It's amazing!
[612.68 --> 613.90]  This is allowed?
[614.70 --> 616.22]  I love it!
[616.22 --> 621.18]  What the hell?
[621.98 --> 622.90]  I love it!
[623.54 --> 625.12]  It's called Follow Recoil?
[625.18 --> 625.60]  Yeah!
[625.60 --> 629.72]  So cool.
[629.72 --> 631.48]  I don't know how I feel about that.
[631.86 --> 632.74]  I feel great!
[633.10 --> 634.92]  I actually get to play this game now!
[636.40 --> 638.30]  What is the point?
[638.56 --> 639.02]  Like, okay.
[639.02 --> 640.28]  Look!
[640.72 --> 643.82]  If you want to talk, you want to talk, like, realism or whatever.
[643.94 --> 647.14]  Because one of the most compelling arguments that was made to me...
[647.14 --> 648.12]  That's so weird!
[648.28 --> 657.22]  ...was that learning the recoil patterns could be equated to, you know, learning the, you know, how to handle a real weapon or whatever else.
[657.22 --> 659.08]  You could become more skilled at using the weapon.
[659.22 --> 660.24]  And that's fair enough.
[660.70 --> 661.52]  That's fair enough.
[661.52 --> 674.62]  But even on a real weapon, you would actually be able to at least see where the projectiles are landing with near instantaneous visual feedback.
[675.06 --> 675.16]  Yeah.
[675.38 --> 678.06]  So this is basically that.
[678.12 --> 686.12]  Because a lot of the time, whether we're talking CS2 or we're talking some other game, you can't actually see a bullet hole where it goes.
[686.20 --> 687.60]  You have no flippin' idea.
[687.60 --> 687.72]  Yeah.
[688.20 --> 699.32]  So in a way, this is more true to the actual original intent while still keeping things, you know, how they always were for the purists.
[699.48 --> 701.00]  My brain's exploding right now.
[701.02 --> 701.74]  I'm so happy!
[702.64 --> 710.60]  And there will still be a slight advantage to having it memorized because while I'm sitting there kind of, like, keeping my crosshair on someone...
[711.72 --> 711.92]  Yeah.
[712.06 --> 715.16]  You'll be having your muscle memory, which is great, which, you know, which is fine.
[715.16 --> 720.16]  But what it means is that players who don't have it memorized are not just...
[720.70 --> 724.22]  Basically turning every gun into a shotgun.
[725.02 --> 727.44]  Which is how it works now, as far as I can tell.
[728.68 --> 729.88]  You know what's interesting, too?
[730.06 --> 733.16]  Is that with CS2, there's been a ton of...
[733.16 --> 737.46]  I love what a salty, like...
[737.46 --> 739.98]  Gamer he's being right now.
[740.12 --> 741.22]  This is so much fun, actually.
[741.22 --> 742.62]  No, you know why I am?
[742.76 --> 743.62]  Sure, yeah.
[743.84 --> 745.04]  Because you're a gamer.
[745.24 --> 746.84]  I've been playing a bunch of Wingman.
[747.50 --> 749.32]  Had no idea this was a thing.
[749.98 --> 751.22]  Oh, that's why you're mad?
[751.22 --> 751.64]  Yeah!
[751.64 --> 757.18]  What the heck?
[757.50 --> 762.50]  Okay, like, there was one thing we ran into, which was, I think it was called perspective audio or something.
[762.70 --> 763.00]  Yeah.
[763.50 --> 766.86]  I was trying to figure out, like, why I can't hear anyone half the time.
[767.28 --> 773.16]  Like, there's this balcony thing, and I'm playing under the balcony, and some guy just lands behind me.
[773.22 --> 774.92]  I'm like, I didn't hear him jump over the balcony.
[775.04 --> 776.58]  How did he land behind me?
[776.58 --> 776.82]  Sure.
[777.54 --> 782.78]  And I ended up figuring out that this perspective audio thing made it so that I, like, hear sounds that are in front of me...
[782.78 --> 783.38]  Oh, interesting.
[783.56 --> 785.72]  ...more differently than I hear other sounds or something.
[785.86 --> 793.32]  And I don't think it works very well, because I turn it off, and it's like, oh, careful, you might not hear things as, like, positionally as you did before.
[793.74 --> 796.90]  And suddenly, now I can hear things, and I know where people are by turning it off.
[796.96 --> 797.14]  Right.
[797.20 --> 798.62]  So I don't know if maybe that's a me thing.
[798.70 --> 800.80]  Maybe I'm just used to the old form of audio more.
[801.06 --> 801.52]  I don't know.
[801.60 --> 804.52]  But I swear I couldn't hear stuff, and then I turn it off, and I could hear stuff.
[804.52 --> 809.04]  I didn't realize there was, you know, a setting that just tells you where the bullets are gonna go.
[809.20 --> 811.02]  Square pusher goes, how's he being salty?
[811.12 --> 813.06]  He's just debating whether it's a good or bad thing.
[813.28 --> 815.18]  No, no, I can just, I've just known him a long time.
[815.30 --> 817.62]  I can tell from his body language and his facial expression.
[817.62 --> 818.24]  Oh, no, I was salty.
[818.24 --> 821.32]  He's like, he was a super salty boy while I was talking about this.
[821.32 --> 824.22]  I'm just salty because I didn't know it existed, and I've been trying to play without it.
[824.22 --> 826.02]  And you know what?
[826.14 --> 832.02]  It's, okay, look, for the people who are upset about it, I will offer, I'll offer one more
[832.02 --> 834.64]  kind of parallel that I think might make it make more sense.
[835.32 --> 840.96]  Valve already has had, going as far back to at least 1.6, which is the first I played Counter-Strike.
[841.22 --> 841.42]  Really?
[841.42 --> 844.02]  So even going back there...
[844.02 --> 845.26]  Are you sure you didn't play an earlier one?
[845.68 --> 846.56]  Yeah, I'm very sure.
[846.64 --> 846.88]  Okay.
[847.16 --> 849.10]  Yeah, I wasn't a gamer.
[849.40 --> 849.66]  Okay.
[850.06 --> 855.00]  Like, I didn't, or I was, but I had a Pentium 166 until like 2003.
[856.14 --> 856.58]  Mmm.
[857.08 --> 860.00]  Like, I couldn't play 3D games.
[860.30 --> 860.88]  Yeah, okay.
[861.54 --> 867.98]  Anyway, so even going back to 1.6, it's not like the crosshair hasn't always been somewhat adaptive,
[868.16 --> 869.66]  depending on what you're doing.
[869.66 --> 874.40]  If you start strafing, it'll get a little bit bigger in order to signify that there will
[874.40 --> 876.72]  be a reduced level of accuracy.
[876.94 --> 878.88]  You crouch at it and it gets smaller.
[879.10 --> 884.84]  So this paradigm has existed in the game for 20 years.
[884.84 --> 892.64]  I think the thing that makes it kind of chill to me is if you're at an extremely high level,
[892.74 --> 894.34]  it's not really going to make a difference anyways.
[895.00 --> 895.86]  Yeah, exactly.
[895.86 --> 902.38]  But now the difference between being an elite level player who has it memorized and being
[902.38 --> 905.40]  someone who's good at FPS but doesn't have it memorized.
[905.54 --> 906.90]  Doesn't necessarily play Counter-Strike all the time.
[907.02 --> 908.58]  It doesn't have to be this.
[908.88 --> 909.94]  It can be this.
[910.06 --> 912.16]  So you can at least, whatever.
[912.30 --> 912.82]  Or this.
[912.82 --> 917.70]  The point is it can narrow the gap a little bit so the game can actually be fun at all
[917.70 --> 920.40]  for people who play FPS but don't play Counter-Strike.
[920.46 --> 923.94]  It narrows a portion of the gap that I would argue is mostly frustration.
[924.70 --> 925.02]  Yes.
[925.10 --> 926.48]  It's very frustrated.
[926.78 --> 932.80]  It's very frustrating if you mostly play games where the crosshair is where the bullet
[932.80 --> 938.70]  goes and you drop in a Counter-Strike and you go, well, between the netcode and the hitboxes
[938.70 --> 944.76]  and the utterly useless crosshair, I have no idea where my bullets are going.
[945.00 --> 946.06]  So you've heard about that.
[946.06 --> 946.60]  What is even the plan?
[946.62 --> 949.94]  And now I get to sit here for five minutes and wait for the next round.
[949.94 --> 956.78]  Like it can be a very punishing gaming experience for new users and if they want to sell more
[956.78 --> 964.74]  skins, they've got to make it more accessible, which is great for me and I'll just not buy
[964.74 --> 965.18]  the skins.
[966.60 --> 967.40]  I'm stoked.
[967.86 --> 968.02]  Yeah.
[968.18 --> 972.98]  I haven't been this excited for Counter-Strike ever, but I'm super down.
[973.12 --> 974.16]  Are we going to play at the LAN then?
[974.50 --> 979.74]  Oh, I'm 100% down because I might actually be somewhat useful for a change because I'm pretty
[979.74 --> 980.24]  okay.
[980.36 --> 981.06]  I mean, you know this.
[981.28 --> 983.80]  I'm pretty okay when it comes to like...
[983.80 --> 984.08]  Tactics.
[984.18 --> 984.54]  Yeah.
[984.72 --> 985.12]  Strategy.
[985.28 --> 987.28]  Covering corners, covering flanks.
[987.40 --> 989.16]  Like I'm pretty okay at that stuff.
[989.46 --> 993.80]  My issue in Counter-Strike is I can't hit the broad side of a barn with any of the guns other
[993.80 --> 996.30]  than the very first bullet because I had...
[996.30 --> 997.10]  Okay.
[997.52 --> 1003.06]  Because the meta changed from burst fire to just holding it down and memorizing things at
[1003.06 --> 1003.54]  some point.
[1004.02 --> 1005.02]  And so I'm just like, all right.
[1005.24 --> 1005.38]  Yeah.
[1005.46 --> 1007.88]  Way back when we first started, it was all burst fire.
[1007.88 --> 1013.56]  And then people learned the patterns and then it was, no, do the full mag, but know the
[1013.56 --> 1013.90]  pattern.
[1014.14 --> 1014.28]  Yeah.
[1014.54 --> 1014.74]  Yeah.
[1014.86 --> 1015.04]  Yeah.
[1015.12 --> 1019.32]  And so, you know, it's just gotten to the point where the time to kill for anyone who
[1019.32 --> 1026.18]  would do that was so low that, you know, I could be sitting there with 100 health and
[1026.18 --> 1032.28]  they have 20 and I'd managed to put one bullet into their ankle and they'd managed to put
[1032.28 --> 1033.58]  six through my skull.
[1033.58 --> 1035.56]  And I'm just kind of sitting here going, well, this is ridiculous.
[1036.10 --> 1038.32]  And it's not because I have terrible aim.
[1038.40 --> 1044.84]  I'm actually a somewhat okay FPS player.
[1045.50 --> 1046.24]  I'm okay.
[1046.48 --> 1047.98]  You're better than you often put on.
[1048.28 --> 1048.98]  I'm okay.
[1049.08 --> 1051.70]  Well, the problem for me is I'm all over the place though.
[1051.70 --> 1057.18]  Like we've, we've logged into Halo Infinite and I'm like carrying and then we've logged
[1057.18 --> 1059.42]  into Halo Infinite and I'm getting absolutely nothing done.
[1059.62 --> 1062.56]  And I don't think it's because the opponents changed a ton.
[1062.64 --> 1064.06]  Like this is against similar ranked opponents.
[1064.16 --> 1071.12]  I'm just, I'm one of those people who, I don't know what it is, but my day to day skill
[1071.12 --> 1074.32]  variance is the highest out of anyone I know.
[1074.44 --> 1076.42]  And that's not, that's not just gaming.
[1076.68 --> 1079.26]  Like that's something I observe in badminton as well.
[1079.34 --> 1081.12]  I play against the same people every week.
[1081.12 --> 1081.64]  Super checks.
[1081.74 --> 1082.46]  Every Tuesday.
[1085.78 --> 1087.48]  That's a terrible example, Linus.
[1092.36 --> 1092.80]  Okay.
[1093.72 --> 1094.20]  So.
[1094.52 --> 1095.88]  I'm going to die tonight.
[1095.90 --> 1101.86]  We've gone from handshaking to like, Luke, you're going to be hard to replace, man.
[1102.30 --> 1108.32]  I've known, I've known since last week that this week was going to go very poorly for me.
[1108.38 --> 1109.92]  And I've just been embracing it.
[1109.92 --> 1113.10]  I've just been poking the bear being like, I know I'm going to get wrecked.
[1113.10 --> 1114.76]  I just might as well have it be epic.
[1115.16 --> 1121.18]  So for those of you who don't have the context for this, I treated myself to a bubble hockey
[1121.18 --> 1122.50]  game a little while ago.
[1122.50 --> 1124.30]  It looks a little something like this one.
[1125.18 --> 1128.18]  And Luke had beat me once before.
[1128.68 --> 1132.06]  We play most nights after when since, since we got it.
[1132.12 --> 1133.22]  And he beat me once.
[1133.28 --> 1134.26]  He's had some close ones.
[1134.34 --> 1136.04]  Like it's not like I just dunk on him every week.
[1136.04 --> 1137.42]  Once outside of last week.
[1137.62 --> 1137.86]  Had you?
[1137.92 --> 1138.28]  Was it two?
[1138.50 --> 1139.26]  I think three.
[1139.66 --> 1140.78]  Well, it definitely wasn't three.
[1140.86 --> 1141.46]  I'd remember that.
[1141.54 --> 1142.32]  It was at least two.
[1142.40 --> 1142.60]  Okay.
[1142.70 --> 1143.06]  Two then.
[1143.60 --> 1149.14]  So he'd beat me a couple times, but like they were, they were one-offs and I had won
[1149.14 --> 1151.46]  like two or three other games that same night.
[1151.52 --> 1152.06]  Both times.
[1152.22 --> 1152.58]  Yeah.
[1152.58 --> 1156.38]  Last Friday, he beat me three in a row.
[1156.82 --> 1160.34]  I was pretty gapped to not happy.
[1160.72 --> 1163.06]  Like most games, they weren't one by one point.
[1163.28 --> 1163.42]  Yeah.
[1163.42 --> 1163.80]  It was.
[1163.96 --> 1164.92]  I was not happy.
[1165.38 --> 1165.56]  Yeah.
[1165.64 --> 1168.64]  We had that first absolutely wild game.
[1168.64 --> 1169.28]  That was a nuts game.
[1169.30 --> 1171.70]  He beat me seven, six in overtime, which.
[1173.74 --> 1176.94]  Oh, I was not happy about very high scoring.
[1177.18 --> 1178.08]  Very back and forth game.
[1178.26 --> 1180.74]  The shots to score ratio was insane.
[1181.18 --> 1182.06]  Absolutely insane.
[1182.06 --> 1185.00]  Neither of us could stop a puck to save our lives.
[1185.30 --> 1186.06]  It was crazy.
[1186.40 --> 1189.66]  And then, and then the next two were not even, not even close.
[1189.92 --> 1190.36]  Yeah.
[1190.36 --> 1191.62]  This week, I'm not f***ing around.
[1191.88 --> 1193.46]  So let's, let's go boys.
[1193.60 --> 1196.78]  Like I knew he was going to take that approach since last week.
[1196.80 --> 1198.10]  I was full effort last week though.
[1198.18 --> 1199.68]  Like I'm not going to make any excuses.
[1199.82 --> 1200.46]  I was trying.
[1200.64 --> 1200.90]  Yeah.
[1201.34 --> 1202.06]  I was trying hard.
[1202.14 --> 1203.22]  But you do this thing.
[1203.60 --> 1204.04]  Yeah.
[1204.30 --> 1208.38]  So like, I just, this week will not be one of these down here.
[1208.62 --> 1209.02]  That's what.
[1209.02 --> 1213.34]  So I like, I poked him the other day in the office.
[1214.12 --> 1215.66]  I poked him some other time.
[1215.70 --> 1216.14]  I don't remember.
[1216.20 --> 1216.92]  I poked him right here.
[1216.98 --> 1217.98]  Just because it's like, whatever.
[1218.12 --> 1219.26]  I might as well make it fun.
[1219.40 --> 1219.64]  Yeah.
[1219.70 --> 1220.04]  All right.
[1220.12 --> 1220.50]  All right.
[1220.58 --> 1220.78]  Yeah.
[1220.82 --> 1221.16]  All right.
[1221.16 --> 1223.92]  Anyway.
[1224.82 --> 1226.02]  So Counter-Strike 2.
[1226.30 --> 1226.74]  I'm stoked.
[1227.08 --> 1227.72]  Let's play it the land.
[1228.24 --> 1228.48]  Sweet.
[1228.78 --> 1228.98]  Yeah.
[1229.12 --> 1229.36]  Yeah.
[1229.46 --> 1229.70]  All right.
[1230.80 --> 1234.00]  But yeah, there's the, just in case you haven't been watching it.
[1234.10 --> 1236.20]  The launch of Counter-Strike 2 has been.
[1237.26 --> 1239.36]  Up and down like my skill level at things.
[1239.48 --> 1239.60]  Yeah.
[1239.64 --> 1242.32]  A little weird to, to, to say the best, to be honest.
[1242.44 --> 1243.24]  Completely removing.
[1243.24 --> 1245.36]  That's not necessarily true.
[1245.42 --> 1248.92]  Cause I think people can still play through the game versions thing that you've talked
[1248.92 --> 1249.60]  about in the past.
[1249.66 --> 1249.78]  Yep.
[1249.78 --> 1250.74]  They can still play CSGO.
[1250.88 --> 1252.60]  But who knows how long that's going to last.
[1252.86 --> 1254.90]  That'll be, that'll become just completely ignored.
[1255.38 --> 1257.78]  It's like a, it's, it's a very strategic.
[1257.78 --> 1260.42]  They know what's going to happen kind of thing.
[1260.42 --> 1265.04]  It's kind of like when you, um, you know, when you release a community poll because you
[1265.04 --> 1267.04]  know what the answer will be.
[1267.70 --> 1272.20]  Um, and, and then it doesn't backfire and you end up daily driving the LG wing.
[1272.86 --> 1273.74]  It's like that.
[1275.40 --> 1276.74]  I don't have one yet.
[1276.80 --> 1280.44]  It's, it's, we, we've bought one on eBay cause obviously you can't buy them new.
[1280.52 --> 1282.00]  So I'm still on the note nine.
[1282.10 --> 1283.70]  Oh, Hey, sorry.
[1283.76 --> 1286.82]  Were you going to finish the thought or can I, I have, I have a little bit more to go
[1286.82 --> 1287.10]  over.
[1288.42 --> 1288.94]  Go ahead.
[1288.94 --> 1294.14]  Um, so yeah, there's, there's the like removal of CSGO, which some people are unhappy about.
[1295.42 --> 1301.46]  There's the, um, there's the really weird hit reg issues, which people have been debating
[1301.46 --> 1305.70]  about quite significantly about like what's actually happening and what's not happening.
[1305.70 --> 1310.58]  But, uh, there's a ton of videos you can find online of, of people clearly shooting people
[1310.58 --> 1312.74]  in the head and they're not getting hit in the head.
[1312.74 --> 1315.72]  And there's also, uh, videos where they show the hit box.
[1315.72 --> 1321.48]  Um, but people have been arguing that the, the hit boxes that's shown when they're doing
[1321.48 --> 1323.02]  that is incorrect or something.
[1323.02 --> 1326.44]  And I don't know, something's weird, whatever there's stuff going on with that.
[1326.74 --> 1331.44]  Um, there's, there's issues where like people just ranking up is just like not functioning
[1331.44 --> 1332.54]  in certain game modes.
[1332.54 --> 1335.12]  There's like all this stuff going on.
[1335.16 --> 1337.52]  That's been honestly really rough.
[1337.86 --> 1340.52]  Um, and it's been, it's been a weird launch.
[1340.66 --> 1341.54]  It's been a weird launch.
[1341.60 --> 1345.62]  Feels like it was too early in my opinion, to be completely honest.
[1346.00 --> 1348.08]  How can you be so early and yet so late?
[1348.32 --> 1348.72]  Yeah.
[1349.46 --> 1349.90]  Yeah.
[1350.30 --> 1351.72]  It's, it's kind of true though.
[1351.72 --> 1352.64]  Like I, yeah.
[1353.36 --> 1357.52]  Um, there was people wanting access for a super, super long time, but then we got it
[1357.52 --> 1359.26]  and it was, it was bad.
[1361.40 --> 1362.20]  My fold.
[1363.00 --> 1363.40]  Yeah.
[1363.66 --> 1364.48]  Dan and I.
[1364.60 --> 1365.44]  With yellow stickers.
[1365.64 --> 1366.80]  Don't worry about the yellow stickers.
[1366.96 --> 1367.28]  Okay.
[1367.46 --> 1367.72]  Rude.
[1367.98 --> 1372.78]  Dan and I, especially Dan made a rescue attempt today.
[1372.94 --> 1373.22]  Yeah.
[1373.70 --> 1377.00]  And I am not going to say anything further on the subject.
[1377.00 --> 1381.56]  They're going to have to watch the video, but it's going to be, it's going to be a really
[1381.56 --> 1382.06]  fun video.
[1382.14 --> 1387.84]  It's, I think Dan, when's the last time you like co-hosted an LTT mainline video?
[1388.06 --> 1390.22]  I don't think I ever have.
[1390.58 --> 1395.22]  Um, cause I was sort of like an add on person for David and you, your Game Gear video.
[1395.42 --> 1397.70]  So this will be my like first co-host.
[1397.80 --> 1399.38]  Oh, cause I'm not, I'm not like a writer.
[1399.50 --> 1399.70]  Right.
[1400.62 --> 1400.92]  So.
[1401.56 --> 1401.96]  Cool.
[1402.06 --> 1402.32]  Yeah.
[1402.58 --> 1402.82]  Yeah.
[1402.82 --> 1408.20]  So guys, if you, if you, if you, if you love Dan and you want to see more of Dan, there
[1408.20 --> 1408.42]  you go.
[1408.48 --> 1408.98]  That's all you get.
[1409.08 --> 1409.26]  Ha!
[1409.34 --> 1409.68]  Got him.
[1409.82 --> 1410.32]  No, sorry.
[1410.64 --> 1417.72]  Uh, so there's an LTT video coming soon where, uh, Dan and I attempt to recover some very important
[1417.72 --> 1421.34]  data that it turns out was on my foldable before it was killed by the pool.
[1421.44 --> 1422.68]  Did I, did I tell you what's on it?
[1423.22 --> 1423.36]  Yeah.
[1423.36 --> 1424.70]  The intro to some video or something.
[1424.96 --> 1425.30]  Yeah.
[1425.66 --> 1426.78]  Well that, yeah.
[1426.78 --> 1431.64]  The intro to a video, the intro to the video where my computer died, which is not something
[1431.64 --> 1432.16]  that is.
[1432.16 --> 1432.98]  Which, which time?
[1433.26 --> 1433.44]  Eas.
[1435.40 --> 1436.42]  The first time.
[1436.58 --> 1436.92]  Okay.
[1437.32 --> 1439.52]  Not something that is easily reproduced.
[1439.56 --> 1439.76]  Okay.
[1439.84 --> 1443.70]  So here's the thing that happened a while back since then.
[1444.70 --> 1448.98]  So when you guys watch the video where I repair the computer, you will be seeing an iteration
[1448.98 --> 1454.90]  of the computer that no longer exists because it actually died like less than a week later.
[1455.48 --> 1459.30]  Again, uh, that time it was, uh, okay.
[1459.42 --> 1461.74]  So the, well, I'm not going to spoil the first one.
[1462.40 --> 1463.22]  Pretty interesting.
[1463.40 --> 1464.82]  It just died.
[1465.24 --> 1465.60]  Okay.
[1465.62 --> 1466.34]  We fix it.
[1466.62 --> 1470.18]  And then the second time this didn't end up being a video because I was like, look, I
[1470.18 --> 1475.60]  can't, I can't make back to back videos one week to the next about like my computer died
[1475.60 --> 1476.38]  and I fixed it.
[1476.38 --> 1477.80]  There's not a lot of content in here.
[1477.80 --> 1479.36]  Uh, but it was interesting.
[1479.54 --> 1484.16]  I, I had a leak in the hard line tubing that I was using.
[1484.24 --> 1490.24]  I was using PETG tubing, which I just grabbed from the warehouse, not knowing that PETG tubing
[1490.24 --> 1495.68]  is out of fashion now in favor of acrylic tubing for hard line because, uh, it's much more
[1495.68 --> 1496.36]  heat sensitive.
[1496.36 --> 1499.80]  So what happened was I used PETG, a hard line tubing.
[1500.80 --> 1509.26]  And during the Sonos, um, like audio box wall video that I did with Alex, we unplugged an
[1509.26 --> 1514.86]  extension cord over there, not realizing that it was connected to the pump that was running
[1514.86 --> 1515.48]  to the pool.
[1515.48 --> 1520.38]  Now, normally thermal throttling would prevent that from causing any kind of an issue.
[1520.50 --> 1525.58]  The water would just get really hot in the loop and your CPU would throttle to save itself.
[1525.70 --> 1529.04]  But what happened was it's a perfect storm, right?
[1529.12 --> 1530.50]  So we had no pump.
[1531.18 --> 1532.98]  Uh, the CPU got really hot.
[1533.56 --> 1533.86]  Oh, sorry.
[1533.94 --> 1534.62]  We had no pump.
[1534.94 --> 1541.32]  It was an all metal block, highly heat conductive metal top, solid piece of metal, uh, from EK.
[1541.66 --> 1544.48]  And then number three is I was using PETG tubing.
[1545.48 --> 1551.66]  So that heat with that heat conduction, with that heat sensitive tubing caused it to contract
[1551.66 --> 1557.82]  and bend and open up a little bit and the O ring failed.
[1558.02 --> 1565.54]  So it killed not only my gaming system, but also the motherboard of the Storinator like server
[1565.54 --> 1567.40]  that was, this is weird.
[1569.08 --> 1572.86]  Three systems lower, but neither of the systems in between.
[1572.86 --> 1573.68]  Don't ask me.
[1573.76 --> 1579.08]  I still couldn't explain to you how the water killed this one and this one, but not these
[1579.08 --> 1579.24]  two.
[1579.24 --> 1580.40]  Were those two wet at all?
[1581.14 --> 1585.50]  I mean, I was like, a bit of water, like on, you know, like the housing casing, like,
[1585.50 --> 1590.50]  but there were, this is a video that's coming where I will show the super micro motherboard
[1590.50 --> 1592.74]  and all the points of corrosion on it and stuff.
[1592.82 --> 1594.82]  Like it, it got wasted.
[1598.02 --> 1598.38]  Wasted.
[1598.38 --> 1599.32]  Surface tension.
[1600.52 --> 1600.78]  Yeah.
[1600.96 --> 1601.24]  Yeah.
[1601.30 --> 1601.82]  I don't know.
[1601.92 --> 1603.76]  I mean, it must have climbed some weird way.
[1603.82 --> 1605.02]  It must have like, clung.
[1605.46 --> 1605.68]  Yeah.
[1606.42 --> 1608.24]  Under, you know, to something.
[1608.48 --> 1609.02]  I don't know.
[1609.12 --> 1610.04]  Wormed its way down.
[1610.10 --> 1610.68]  Water, man.
[1610.98 --> 1611.16]  Yeah.
[1611.16 --> 1615.48]  You can never, you can never make something waterproof because water will, water will find
[1615.48 --> 1616.72]  it and it will f*** it up.
[1617.50 --> 1618.32]  Pretty much.
[1618.48 --> 1619.14]  That's water.
[1621.80 --> 1623.40]  It's got all the time in the world.
[1624.40 --> 1625.20]  Oh, no.
[1626.14 --> 1626.38]  Yeah.
[1626.44 --> 1627.18]  Chaos the bomb.
[1627.76 --> 1631.02]  They had a Corsair Commander Pro fail on them, causing their pump to fail.
[1631.36 --> 1634.58]  Their PETG loop got hot enough for the fittings to be able to compress the tubes.
[1635.00 --> 1637.16]  Came back the next day to a puddle under my machine.
[1637.16 --> 1639.48]  Thankfully, it was off.
[1639.74 --> 1641.22]  No damage, but lesson learned.
[1641.76 --> 1642.20]  Yeah.
[1642.76 --> 1644.04]  Very, very lucky.
[1647.00 --> 1647.40]  Yeah.
[1647.54 --> 1652.28]  Years ago, my work workstation got killed when the lady's restroom flooded overnight hundreds
[1652.28 --> 1652.84]  of feet away.
[1652.92 --> 1653.06]  Yeah.
[1653.30 --> 1654.40]  See, that's what I'm talking about.
[1655.10 --> 1655.50]  Water.
[1655.70 --> 1656.42]  It's like life.
[1657.64 --> 1658.04]  It just...
[1658.04 --> 1659.06]  It finds a way?
[1659.14 --> 1660.58]  It finds a way, man.
[1660.66 --> 1661.46]  It finds a way.
[1661.88 --> 1663.86]  You know, dams and condoms.
[1664.18 --> 1665.42]  That's what they have in common.
[1667.16 --> 1672.18]  What do I have in common with condoms?
[1672.24 --> 1673.16]  They fail.
[1673.16 --> 1674.38]  They just find a way through them.
[1679.22 --> 1680.54]  Oh, my goodness.
[1682.94 --> 1683.98]  We can move on now.
[1684.12 --> 1684.38]  Yeah.
[1684.62 --> 1685.12]  All right.
[1686.08 --> 1686.52]  What?
[1686.58 --> 1686.98]  I don't know.
[1687.34 --> 1688.10]  PlayStation Slim?
[1688.40 --> 1689.16]  Why are...
[1689.92 --> 1691.74]  Why do you care about this?
[1692.10 --> 1693.12]  I think it's really cool.
[1693.28 --> 1694.84]  But they release a Slim every time.
[1694.84 --> 1695.52]  I know, but now it's...
[1695.52 --> 1696.60]  We knew there was one coming.
[1696.70 --> 1698.72]  But now it's a faster, better one.
[1699.10 --> 1699.44]  Okay.
[1699.44 --> 1699.72]  Okay.
[1699.80 --> 1699.96]  No.
[1700.06 --> 1705.44]  The reason I wanted to talk about this is because I looked at this and I went, oh, man.
[1705.44 --> 1712.32]  I can imagine the conversations at Sony that would have prompted this product.
[1712.78 --> 1712.96]  Okay.
[1712.96 --> 1717.02]  So you remember the original PlayStation 5 was available in two variants, right?
[1717.12 --> 1718.08]  Or not was, is.
[1718.16 --> 1718.76]  It's still available.
[1718.96 --> 1721.30]  So the original PlayStation 5, two variants.
[1721.40 --> 1723.42]  You've got the disc version for $4.99.
[1723.42 --> 1729.18]  And then you've got the discless all digital version for $3.99, if I recall correctly, in
[1729.18 --> 1732.32]  American Yankee doubloons or whatever they call them.
[1734.48 --> 1741.72]  And, you know, as far as I'm aware, the majority of the sales have been of the disc version because
[1741.72 --> 1745.82]  it makes a lot of sense that as a console gamer, you might want to collect physical copies of
[1745.82 --> 1750.08]  your games so that you, you know, have them in the event of, you know, I don't know, you
[1750.08 --> 1751.60]  have bad internet or whatever else.
[1751.60 --> 1757.38]  And also so that you can resell them, which is a huge value and something that I think one
[1757.38 --> 1763.14]  of the big console makers is going to figure out and force the other's hands, I hope, and
[1763.14 --> 1764.36]  cause the industry to change.
[1764.44 --> 1767.70]  But for now is just not something that can happen with digital games.
[1767.90 --> 1769.04]  Does someone allow it?
[1769.04 --> 1771.58]  Oh, I thought you meant the other way around.
[1771.64 --> 1772.20]  No, digital games.
[1772.20 --> 1772.92]  What are you saying?
[1773.02 --> 1774.82]  Yeah, yeah, with digital games, you can't resell them.
[1774.98 --> 1783.04]  So I, so, so right now there is easily a $100 benefit to buying a disc version of a console
[1783.04 --> 1788.32]  and buying all disc games so that you can, especially if you're a prolific game player, so you can
[1788.32 --> 1794.58]  buy games, play them, resell them and get, get that and effectively subsidize your own future
[1794.58 --> 1795.52]  gaming experiences.
[1795.52 --> 1795.80]  Right.
[1795.80 --> 1804.42]  And I just, I can imagine the conversation around a Sony boardroom table when they released
[1804.42 --> 1813.40]  these two separate SKUs of the product and then saw some user feedback that went, how's
[1813.40 --> 1815.44]  the optical drive not just an add-on module?
[1815.44 --> 1823.92]  Why did you produce two separate SKUs of this thing instead of just, I don't know, a USB
[1823.92 --> 1824.50]  drive?
[1825.32 --> 1829.96]  This is technology that's existed for 30 years or however long.
[1829.96 --> 1834.58]  We've also literally had consoles that like you can click in an optical drive since like
[1834.58 --> 1837.34]  Sega Genesis or something?
[1837.72 --> 1838.06]  Yeah.
[1838.06 --> 1839.34]  Like it's been a long time.
[1839.34 --> 1840.34]  It's been a long time.
[1840.34 --> 1842.08]  I don't remember which one, but it's been a very long time.
[1842.08 --> 1842.44]  It's been a long time.
[1842.44 --> 1848.42]  I mean, wasn't the original PlayStation the result of the failed collaboration between
[1848.42 --> 1854.28]  Sony and Nintendo to add a disc-based add-on to a Nintendo console?
[1854.80 --> 1861.38]  And so I just find it so funny that the new ones are coming out or the new one is coming
[1861.38 --> 1863.68]  out and that's exactly how they're doing it.
[1863.70 --> 1874.28]  They're like, oh, so you can get the new PS5 Slim and it does not have a, oh wow.
[1874.28 --> 1877.44]  The Famicom computer disc system.
[1879.50 --> 1881.58]  Availability started in 1986.
[1882.44 --> 1884.80]  Okay, but that's not a CD, but yes.
[1884.92 --> 1886.74]  It's a, you know what I'm saying.
[1886.74 --> 1887.00]  But you're right.
[1887.08 --> 1889.54]  Basically the concept's been around as long as I've been alive.
[1889.76 --> 1889.94]  Yeah.
[1889.94 --> 1892.60]  So Sony, okay, here, let's go through the thing.
[1892.70 --> 1896.04]  Sony announced a new slim model of PS5 reduced in volume by over 30%.
[1896.04 --> 1897.46]  That's good because it was big.
[1897.84 --> 1903.00]  I mean, honestly, it still looks kind of big, but anywho.
[1903.14 --> 1907.80]  And weight by 18% comes with a terabyte of storage will be the new default model.
[1908.10 --> 1909.96]  That's my leg, not the desk.
[1909.98 --> 1911.22]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1912.00 --> 1913.10]  Well, you know what?
[1913.16 --> 1914.66]  Let's put see between friends.
[1914.66 --> 1919.16]  It features a removable disc drive.
[1919.56 --> 1923.72]  A digital edition can be bought without the drive for a $30 discount.
[1923.92 --> 1927.38]  If gamers then change their minds, the separate drive can be bought for $80.
[1928.04 --> 1932.76]  While the console is portrayed standing upright in most of Sony's marketing material, this actually
[1932.76 --> 1935.82]  requires a separate vertical stand that costs another $30.
[1935.82 --> 1939.12]  So Sony has done some pretty clever stuff here.
[1939.48 --> 1939.70]  Yeah.
[1940.04 --> 1942.60]  Effectively raising the price of the PlayStation.
[1942.60 --> 1944.74]  Buy the expensive one or you might regret it.
[1944.78 --> 1949.98]  They've done exactly what we were talking about in the pre-show today, presenting two options.
[1949.98 --> 1953.38]  It's an unappealing one and...
[1953.38 --> 1954.48]  An expensive one.
[1954.52 --> 1955.32]  An expensive...
[1955.32 --> 1956.70]  A more expensive one.
[1957.12 --> 1959.64]  So here, what does this work out to?
[1959.68 --> 1960.68]  Where's the actual...
[1960.68 --> 1961.90]  Where's the actual pricing?
[1962.70 --> 1963.44]  Blah, blah, blah.
[1963.66 --> 1965.20]  New look PlayStation 5.
[1965.50 --> 1965.94]  Yeah.
[1966.08 --> 1966.32]  Okay.
[1966.38 --> 1966.80]  Here we go.
[1967.24 --> 1970.54]  So if you want to upgrade later...
[1970.54 --> 1971.46]  PS5...
[1971.46 --> 1971.68]  Okay.
[1972.32 --> 1975.14]  Here we go.
[1975.26 --> 1975.50]  Okay.
[1975.50 --> 1983.24]  So it's still $500 for the new Slim PS5 with the Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive.
[1983.96 --> 1985.38]  So that is unchanged.
[1985.98 --> 1992.66]  But it's clear that they are no longer interested in selling digital editions for $400 because
[1992.66 --> 1995.82]  that is now $449 for the new Slim one.
[1996.24 --> 2000.88]  Then if you want to add the drive after the fact, that's $80, bringing you to $530.
[2001.42 --> 2003.30]  You want to put it standing upright?
[2003.30 --> 2007.78]  That's going to be another $30 for a total of $560.
[2008.36 --> 2016.44]  So they have effectively changed the price from $499 to $429 for the one that's fully equipped.
[2016.44 --> 2021.86]  And from $400 to $449 plus $30 for a stand.
[2021.96 --> 2023.72]  So $489...
[2023.72 --> 2025.64]  $479.
[2026.14 --> 2027.22]  I hate the $9.
[2027.34 --> 2028.12]  $480.
[2028.92 --> 2036.76]  Or then if you want to add the drive later on after the fact, it's like $560 or something
[2036.76 --> 2037.18]  like that.
[2037.18 --> 2046.20]  Honestly, as far as ways of raising the price go, this is relatively inoffensive to me.
[2046.28 --> 2050.24]  I think that if they had just raised the price outright, that would be worse.
[2050.24 --> 2056.96]  But as someone who would have strongly advocated for buying the disc version of it, both in
[2056.96 --> 2061.98]  terms of the practicality of being able to resell your games and in terms of resale value
[2061.98 --> 2067.54]  of the console itself, what I suspect is that all digital ones are going to be perceived
[2067.54 --> 2072.44]  as less valued to people who are getting these things down the road.
[2072.44 --> 2073.66]  I also might suspect...
[2073.66 --> 2077.56]  I know one of the big draws of PlayStation is a lot of their single player games, actually.
[2078.50 --> 2085.64]  And I suspect if you wanted to play on the road or something, I don't know, if you're
[2085.64 --> 2090.32]  in a situation where you didn't have internet, maybe it's down, who knows, I think you'd still
[2090.32 --> 2091.48]  be able to play with the discs.
[2092.14 --> 2093.04]  Pretty cool.
[2093.36 --> 2093.56]  Yeah.
[2093.72 --> 2096.90]  So I would strongly advocate for that anyway.
[2096.90 --> 2103.52]  So I don't mind this and I don't mind it costing a little bit more if you go, whoopsie doodle,
[2103.58 --> 2104.48]  I changed my mind.
[2104.90 --> 2107.60]  Because it's not that much more.
[2107.68 --> 2108.68]  It's 30 bucks more.
[2110.28 --> 2110.72]  Yeah.
[2110.82 --> 2111.00]  Yeah.
[2111.00 --> 2112.26]  About $30 more.
[2113.34 --> 2115.10]  If you change your mind after the fact.
[2115.60 --> 2119.00]  Here, you can have a look at what the modular interface looks like.
[2119.06 --> 2126.42]  I'm sure dbrand is currently beavering away trying to figure out how to make dark plates
[2126.42 --> 2128.68]  in these shapes and sizes and all that.
[2131.02 --> 2131.92]  Unhelpful for dbrand.
[2132.06 --> 2133.26]  It's slightly less ugly now.
[2136.12 --> 2136.74]  It is.
[2136.84 --> 2138.80]  I actually, I like the look of it a lot better.
[2139.20 --> 2143.30]  Although, you know, I do think it would look cooler in different colors and stuff like
[2143.30 --> 2143.50]  that.
[2143.52 --> 2145.56]  And I'm sure that that's something that they can capitalize on.
[2146.92 --> 2147.32]  Yeah.
[2148.10 --> 2151.90]  I'm not, I'm not the biggest fan of the like monochrome future.
[2153.70 --> 2155.16]  I was thinking about this the other day.
[2155.16 --> 2157.46]  Your car is growing on me.
[2157.64 --> 2158.60]  No way.
[2158.82 --> 2159.04]  Yeah.
[2159.42 --> 2163.48]  The stupid Damascus war zone, stupid rap.
[2163.88 --> 2164.52]  You know what?
[2164.54 --> 2165.90]  It did the same thing with me.
[2166.04 --> 2166.32]  Really?
[2166.60 --> 2166.86]  Yeah.
[2166.98 --> 2167.74]  I, I, I.
[2171.24 --> 2172.78]  It's going to hurt him to say it.
[2172.84 --> 2173.70]  Kind of like it now.
[2173.88 --> 2174.08]  Yeah.
[2174.56 --> 2174.82]  Yeah.
[2175.28 --> 2179.16]  Like my kids liked it immediately, but maybe that's not their childish tastes.
[2179.30 --> 2181.60]  Maybe that's just their more malleable minds.
[2181.60 --> 2184.48]  Maybe they're just more open to new ideas and experiences.
[2184.48 --> 2191.62]  Because for so long, all design, all like interior design, a lot of clothing, cars, everything
[2191.62 --> 2192.44]  is just my house.
[2192.82 --> 2193.28]  White and black.
[2193.54 --> 2195.00]  Everything in my house is white and black.
[2195.08 --> 2195.76]  Don't forget about gray.
[2196.22 --> 2196.40]  Yeah.
[2196.78 --> 2198.50]  White, black, and the shades between.
[2198.64 --> 2199.58]  It's inoffensive.
[2200.06 --> 2200.42]  Yeah.
[2201.00 --> 2201.64]  But it's.
[2201.64 --> 2203.64]  Boring.
[2204.36 --> 2205.80]  Not particularly interesting.
[2206.02 --> 2206.18]  Yep.
[2206.44 --> 2206.70]  Yep.
[2206.74 --> 2207.18]  That's fair.
[2207.68 --> 2208.16]  That's fair.
[2208.26 --> 2208.76]  I get it.
[2209.14 --> 2215.44]  Uh, Yvonne and I are, you know, what's really funny is I, uh, I, I was, I was grappling with
[2215.44 --> 2217.18]  this on Wednesday.
[2217.58 --> 2220.76]  I was, uh, I was ordering a cage topper.
[2220.92 --> 2221.98]  Do you know what a cage topper is?
[2222.30 --> 2223.78]  It's pretty self-explanatory.
[2223.98 --> 2224.16]  It's a.
[2224.28 --> 2225.20]  I think I can guess.
[2225.26 --> 2226.20]  Top piece for a cage.
[2226.26 --> 2227.56]  Well, it's actually for an aquarium.
[2228.00 --> 2234.30]  It's for the, the mice that we have as cat TV and I had a top for it, but it was, uh,
[2234.30 --> 2238.18]  it was a top I made myself and it was made of just like some kind of particle board of
[2238.18 --> 2239.70]  some sort and the mice are chewing through it.
[2240.08 --> 2245.08]  And I, in a house with cats, the last thing you want is your mice getting out because it's,
[2245.14 --> 2246.82]  you know, out of the frying pan into the fire a little bit.
[2246.86 --> 2247.00]  Right.
[2247.56 --> 2253.34]  Um, so this cage topper is from a company called a quality cage or something like that.
[2253.52 --> 2254.28]  Um, sure.
[2254.28 --> 2259.40]  And basically it sits on top of your aquarium, goes about like three inches down so that
[2259.40 --> 2265.14]  it can't be easily tipped over by, um, curious cats, feline, uh, companion.
[2265.46 --> 2269.20]  Um, and then it has a couple of little ramps as a ramp that goes down into the aquarium and
[2269.20 --> 2271.84]  then it has a layer and then it has another ramp that goes up to another layer.
[2271.92 --> 2275.84]  So it turns it from just an aquarium into more of like a habitat that they can run around
[2275.84 --> 2276.08]  in.
[2276.08 --> 2281.30]  And, um, I saw some feedback from other customers that talks about how they see way
[2281.30 --> 2285.22]  more of them just like running around in it instead of them just like hiding in their
[2285.22 --> 2285.86]  little burrows.
[2285.86 --> 2287.66]  And it seemed to be really engaging for them.
[2287.70 --> 2293.20]  So I was like, okay, it's really expensive because it's, you know, made in America and
[2293.20 --> 2294.86]  import taxes and stuff like that.
[2294.90 --> 2295.84]  No, no, it's made in America.
[2296.72 --> 2297.12]  Yeah.
[2297.54 --> 2300.90]  I mean, it's really expensive before I pay shipping in taxes because it's made in America.
[2300.90 --> 2301.20]  Right.
[2301.20 --> 2305.88]  Um, but as far as I can tell, they're like a small company and kind of do their own thing
[2305.88 --> 2307.42]  and everything is sort of custom.
[2307.42 --> 2308.02]  Cool to support.
[2308.18 --> 2308.32]  Yeah.
[2308.38 --> 2308.92]  Custom built.
[2309.12 --> 2310.90]  And, um, and I, I reached out to them.
[2310.96 --> 2312.06]  They were super responsive.
[2312.68 --> 2315.70]  And I, so I got confirmation of what was the right product.
[2315.70 --> 2317.40]  And then I'm sitting there on the order page.
[2320.26 --> 2321.44]  I'll show you the options.
[2321.44 --> 2321.76]  Okay.
[2323.64 --> 2324.60]  This is interesting.
[2324.84 --> 2325.64]  I'll show you the options.
[2325.64 --> 2330.04]  While you look for that, someone at floatplane chat mentioned millennial gray, and that's like
[2330.04 --> 2331.20]  actually a thing.
[2331.64 --> 2333.26]  Um, you can look it up.
[2333.34 --> 2337.08]  The like color spectrum of things in our world is narrowing.
[2337.56 --> 2340.42]  Uh, because back in the day, things were much more colorful.
[2340.42 --> 2342.48]  You think like different grains of wood.
[2343.00 --> 2346.92]  Um, you think all the different colors and patterns that used to be in homes back in the
[2346.92 --> 2347.12]  day.
[2347.12 --> 2349.20]  And then millennials are just like, nope.
[2349.94 --> 2350.36]  Whoa.
[2351.32 --> 2351.80]  Okay.
[2352.28 --> 2355.94]  So they've got purple and pink.
[2356.22 --> 2356.62]  Whoa.
[2356.98 --> 2358.48]  And teal.
[2358.48 --> 2361.50]  All these fun colors.
[2361.66 --> 2363.06]  Ooh, look at stardust.
[2363.18 --> 2363.32]  Okay.
[2363.34 --> 2366.38]  That's really hard to see on the screen, but what about quality blue?
[2366.88 --> 2367.78]  Quality blue.
[2367.88 --> 2370.46]  And I ended up with silver vein.
[2370.82 --> 2374.60]  Oh, actually I might've gone with galvanized cause it's a little bit cheaper.
[2374.60 --> 2376.52]  And I was just like, yep.
[2377.30 --> 2377.70]  Oh wow.
[2377.74 --> 2378.92]  I see that is quite expensive.
[2379.32 --> 2380.82]  Cages are oddly expensive.
[2381.36 --> 2383.96]  Like the bird cage that we have is like really expensive.
[2384.14 --> 2384.74]  I believe you.
[2385.38 --> 2386.50]  I don't really know why.
[2386.50 --> 2387.86]  Um, yeah.
[2388.04 --> 2394.52]  So I, I tried, I tried so hard to order the purple one, or even stardust.
[2394.64 --> 2395.50]  So just got gray.
[2395.62 --> 2397.42]  I, I still bought gray.
[2398.12 --> 2400.70]  I just, I can't, I can't bring myself to do it.
[2400.80 --> 2401.42]  My, it's funny.
[2401.48 --> 2401.62]  Yeah.
[2401.62 --> 2402.40]  Like, yeah.
[2402.44 --> 2402.96]  You know what?
[2402.96 --> 2409.48]  No, I mean, I, I, I, I do splash of color here and there, but I, not in my house.
[2410.02 --> 2410.44]  Yeah.
[2410.80 --> 2413.10]  Everything in my house is black, white, or gray.
[2413.10 --> 2417.00]  Because as soon as I choose anything other than black, white, or gray, I have to think
[2417.00 --> 2418.54]  about what goes with it.
[2419.24 --> 2422.56]  And I, I do not, I do not have brain space for that.
[2422.66 --> 2423.40]  I can't.
[2423.92 --> 2424.78]  That's impossible.
[2425.56 --> 2427.48]  Uh, Yvonne can do it a little bit.
[2427.56 --> 2428.54]  Every once in a while.
[2429.38 --> 2430.82]  We'll add some navy blue.
[2430.82 --> 2436.40]  Oh, like that cat cushion that she made for the, uh, the little reading nook thing that
[2436.40 --> 2438.60]  will probably turn into a makeout nook at some point.
[2439.08 --> 2439.38]  Um.
[2439.56 --> 2439.92]  Not there yet.
[2440.24 --> 2441.98]  Not there yet, but, I mean.
[2443.34 --> 2443.92]  Might not be that far away.
[2443.92 --> 2444.76]  Not that far away.
[2444.76 --> 2445.06]  Yeah.
[2445.44 --> 2446.86]  I've been thinking about that.
[2447.84 --> 2448.24]  What?
[2448.34 --> 2449.22]  Making out in my nook?
[2449.64 --> 2449.82]  Uh.
[2450.54 --> 2450.90]  Weird.
[2452.12 --> 2452.88]  With me, or?
[2453.14 --> 2454.46]  The lamp party's coming up.
[2458.04 --> 2458.40]  Um.
[2459.24 --> 2460.70]  No, I just, I don't know.
[2460.70 --> 2465.04]  Every once in a while, I'd, I'd think about, like, what, what grades are his kids in?
[2465.68 --> 2466.04]  Yeah.
[2466.20 --> 2466.62]  Oh.
[2467.18 --> 2467.58]  Yeah.
[2468.12 --> 2473.12]  Then you have that, like, oh, crap moment of, like, what were the kids getting up to
[2473.12 --> 2475.42]  in that grade when I was in that grade?
[2476.02 --> 2480.60]  Or the stories that I would hear from my brother when he was in that grade or whatever, right?
[2480.70 --> 2482.38]  Like, just, it's like, oh.
[2483.66 --> 2484.10]  Wow.
[2484.90 --> 2490.14]  And, like, when you're that age, you're like, darn parents.
[2490.24 --> 2490.64]  Yeah, whatever.
[2490.80 --> 2491.24]  No big deal.
[2491.28 --> 2491.96]  This is normal.
[2492.36 --> 2492.54]  Yeah.
[2492.54 --> 2493.58]  You wish they'd get off my back.
[2493.62 --> 2493.86]  Yeah.
[2493.94 --> 2499.22]  And then now I'm this age, and I'm like, wow, they seem very young.
[2501.10 --> 2502.38]  I don't know.
[2505.52 --> 2506.24]  Oh, man.
[2507.00 --> 2510.08]  My brother is, my brother's a firefighter these days, and he was mentioning the other
[2510.08 --> 2516.76]  day about how he went to a call that wasn't a fire, but firefighters will often respond
[2516.76 --> 2518.38]  to, like, medical calls and stuff as well.
[2518.38 --> 2519.40]  Someone fell out of their bed or whatever.
[2519.40 --> 2525.84]  And it was a bunch of, like, it was a group of chicks that were out clubbing.
[2526.52 --> 2534.04]  And he was like, I just can't, like, he's like, they look like they should be in school.
[2534.04 --> 2534.58]  Yeah.
[2535.30 --> 2537.34]  He's like, this is really weird.
[2537.58 --> 2538.74]  They look like children.
[2539.08 --> 2540.84]  Like, I don't...
[2540.84 --> 2543.26]  He's like, I wanted to send them home.
[2543.26 --> 2549.42]  It's like, man, yeah, I think we're that old.
[2549.78 --> 2552.28]  I think we're that old now.
[2553.36 --> 2554.84]  Yeah, they'll be fine.
[2555.86 --> 2556.14]  Yeah.
[2556.20 --> 2556.38]  Yeah.
[2557.02 --> 2557.78]  Or they won't.
[2558.30 --> 2559.56]  A lot of people are not fine.
[2561.02 --> 2563.54]  You know that expression, the kids will be fine or whatever.
[2563.66 --> 2563.82]  Yeah.
[2563.82 --> 2565.46]  It's like, yeah, I mean...
[2565.46 --> 2566.20]  Maybe not anymore.
[2566.20 --> 2570.18]  Yeah, if that were true, then all the adults today would be fine.
[2571.02 --> 2571.62]  They aren't.
[2573.26 --> 2574.58]  They're like...
[2574.58 --> 2577.78]  Okay, on that note...
[2577.78 --> 2582.48]  Speaking of things that are not okay, I'm trying to find a topic that makes sense for that transition.
[2582.72 --> 2583.36]  Something does.
[2584.74 --> 2585.14]  Sure.
[2585.86 --> 2586.12]  Yeah.
[2586.14 --> 2586.38]  Do it.
[2586.54 --> 2586.86]  Why not?
[2587.12 --> 2587.50]  Do it.
[2587.76 --> 2588.74]  Do it, you coward.
[2588.92 --> 2590.28]  The merch messages are okay, though.
[2591.64 --> 2592.02]  Right.
[2592.18 --> 2593.36]  We should explain merch messages.
[2593.58 --> 2596.00]  Merch messages are the best way to interact with the show.
[2596.00 --> 2597.04]  We don't do super chats.
[2597.14 --> 2598.24]  We don't do Twitch bits.
[2598.34 --> 2599.36]  We do merch messages.
[2599.50 --> 2601.48]  All you get to do is go on lttstore.com,
[2601.48 --> 2604.48]  get into the cart with something that catches your eye, like...
[2605.56 --> 2606.68]  Oh, I don't know.
[2606.80 --> 2608.48]  This bread plushie, or...
[2608.48 --> 2612.18]  It's finally here.
[2612.18 --> 2616.50]  The Luxe Edition of the LTT...
[2616.50 --> 2619.58]  Oh, the cap's open.
[2620.70 --> 2620.94]  It's okay.
[2621.02 --> 2623.52]  I had already consumed most of that beverage.
[2624.20 --> 2630.36]  The Luxe Edition of the LTT Backpack in a stunning Apple leather.
[2630.70 --> 2631.72]  Yes, my friends.
[2632.04 --> 2634.84]  Just in time for Apple to stop using leather.
[2635.06 --> 2637.30]  We are using Apple leather.
[2637.30 --> 2641.30]  It's kind of amazing how good it is.
[2646.52 --> 2650.60]  This is my absolutely brutalized...
[2650.60 --> 2650.86]  Here.
[2651.44 --> 2653.36]  Check out how much stuff I load into this thing.
[2654.38 --> 2655.20]  Yes, that's very heavy.
[2655.32 --> 2655.48]  Yeah.
[2655.56 --> 2659.08]  This is my, like, I go hard on this thing bag.
[2659.20 --> 2661.70]  That is also, like, way overstuffed.
[2661.84 --> 2662.30]  That I've been using for...
[2662.30 --> 2665.48]  It's pinching here just because he has too much stuff in it.
[2665.52 --> 2669.22]  About six months, and it breaks in...
[2669.22 --> 2669.58]  Six months?
[2669.60 --> 2670.10]  That's it?
[2670.26 --> 2673.52]  It breaks in just like a leather bag.
[2673.52 --> 2673.76]  Leather does.
[2674.10 --> 2675.72]  Yeah, it's kind of...
[2675.72 --> 2677.42]  It's actually kind of amazing.
[2677.84 --> 2680.98]  So it actually fits better than it ever did,
[2681.20 --> 2682.54]  and looks...
[2682.54 --> 2685.98]  Other than, obviously, kind of changing shape according to what you store in it,
[2685.98 --> 2688.10]  which I've gone out of my way to put...
[2688.10 --> 2689.10]  I've been just carrying...
[2689.10 --> 2690.38]  I have four screwdrivers in here.
[2690.78 --> 2692.50]  Just, you know, just to...
[2692.50 --> 2693.48]  I have two laptops.
[2693.54 --> 2694.36]  Is one of them the metal one?
[2695.10 --> 2696.52]  No, no, unfortunately.
[2697.22 --> 2698.66]  So I've got, like, my...
[2698.66 --> 2699.88]  Got my...
[2699.88 --> 2701.06]  Oh, that's a mouse pad.
[2702.96 --> 2703.92]  Got my framework.
[2704.54 --> 2705.12]  Got my...
[2705.12 --> 2706.32]  Okay, this is going to be a funny one.
[2707.18 --> 2709.92]  This, like, all touchscreen one.
[2710.50 --> 2711.12]  Oh, yeah.
[2711.12 --> 2713.76]  Yeah, so it has, like, a keyboard, like, folio thing,
[2713.86 --> 2715.18]  but it's, like, two...
[2715.18 --> 2716.60]  It's two folding sides of a screen.
[2716.60 --> 2718.26]  Um, yeah.
[2718.42 --> 2718.90]  It...
[2718.90 --> 2719.32]  Oh!
[2719.76 --> 2721.98]  It's held up incredibly well.
[2722.06 --> 2723.34]  I'm super happy with this thing.
[2723.40 --> 2724.10]  I kept...
[2724.10 --> 2726.40]  I kept waiting for it to have a problem.
[2726.76 --> 2728.60]  For it to, you know, not wear nicely,
[2728.88 --> 2732.18]  or, you know, scuff in a way that was really undesirable,
[2732.42 --> 2734.14]  and just were really happy with the materials.
[2734.62 --> 2737.54]  It's everything you know and love about the existing bag,
[2737.92 --> 2740.16]  but more luxurious.
[2740.68 --> 2742.30]  Anyway, the point is, in the cart,
[2742.62 --> 2743.62]  you leave a message,
[2743.62 --> 2745.46]  you'll see a little pop-up for it,
[2745.46 --> 2748.14]  and it'll either show up under the show,
[2748.56 --> 2749.32]  just like, ah!
[2749.68 --> 2750.58]  Just like, uh, there,
[2750.68 --> 2751.82]  that one for Francis P.,
[2751.82 --> 2752.92]  who just picked up a gift card,
[2753.22 --> 2755.42]  or our producer, Dan,
[2755.46 --> 2756.46]  will respond to your message,
[2756.72 --> 2758.60]  redirect it to someone who can better address it,
[2758.64 --> 2760.94]  or even send it over to us
[2760.94 --> 2764.10]  for talking about during when show after dark,
[2764.14 --> 2765.46]  or maybe even right now.
[2765.54 --> 2767.14]  Dan, do you have a couple merch messages for us?
[2767.26 --> 2768.30]  I do, I do.
[2768.46 --> 2770.14]  Oh, wait, sorry, there's one more thing.
[2770.14 --> 2771.32]  Just want to mention this.
[2771.60 --> 2775.42]  I don't know if this will be a long-term thing.
[2775.56 --> 2777.48]  Right now, the Luxe Backpack
[2777.48 --> 2779.86]  is not going to be a regularly stocked item.
[2780.08 --> 2781.32]  We are taking orders,
[2781.50 --> 2782.72]  and we will do a production run
[2782.72 --> 2784.44]  based on how many orders we get.
[2784.94 --> 2787.40]  It's everything you know and love about the existing bag,
[2787.50 --> 2788.92]  but in a more luxurious material,
[2788.92 --> 2791.14]  so it's kind of a known quantity at this point.
[2792.00 --> 2794.86]  That does mean that there will be a lead time on delivery,
[2795.44 --> 2797.32]  but to kind of make this up to you,
[2797.32 --> 2799.84]  we are offering free shipping for your entire order
[2799.84 --> 2801.20]  with the purchase of the Luxe Bag.
[2801.28 --> 2803.56]  There's a code that shows up on the product page
[2803.56 --> 2804.68]  along with a whole bunch of pictures,
[2804.84 --> 2807.68]  just kind of giving you guys a closer, better look at it.
[2807.98 --> 2810.44]  You can see that at lttstore.com.
[2810.78 --> 2814.28]  People are asking about the zipper pulls.
[2814.54 --> 2815.78]  Those are the new zipper pulls.
[2815.80 --> 2816.24]  Oh, yes.
[2816.60 --> 2819.94]  And he was saying the replacement ones
[2819.94 --> 2821.62]  are still currently being manufactured.
[2821.82 --> 2822.12]  That's right.
[2822.50 --> 2822.70]  Yeah.
[2822.70 --> 2826.24]  Oh, Dan, you know what?
[2826.26 --> 2829.22]  No, we've shown the prototype versions of them.
[2829.44 --> 2829.60]  Yeah.
[2829.92 --> 2832.12]  They're coming just to replace all the ones
[2832.12 --> 2832.90]  on the backpacks we've already started.
[2832.90 --> 2834.38]  So these are a polished version
[2834.38 --> 2837.96]  of the same new style of zipper pulls.
[2837.98 --> 2838.86]  Oh, so a smaller run.
[2838.94 --> 2839.54]  That makes sense.
[2839.72 --> 2839.88]  Yeah.
[2842.40 --> 2843.06]  I don't know.
[2843.16 --> 2844.08]  Yeah, you're not going to really be able
[2844.08 --> 2845.06]  to see that on your phone or whatever.
[2845.42 --> 2845.70]  All good.
[2847.02 --> 2848.28]  I don't go easy on these things.
[2849.48 --> 2850.70]  All right, Dan, want to hit me?
[2851.28 --> 2851.72]  Absolutely.
[2852.02 --> 2853.12]  Let's see what we got here.
[2855.64 --> 2858.02]  Replacing my backpack because it got stolen.
[2858.78 --> 2860.88]  What was the most valuable tech item
[2860.88 --> 2862.64]  you've had stolen or lost?
[2862.82 --> 2866.06]  Man, I had a PDA that was lost, then stolen.
[2866.28 --> 2869.36]  I left it behind in the seats at an ice rink.
[2869.56 --> 2872.46]  And when I went back for it, it was gone.
[2873.30 --> 2875.96]  Oh, actually, that's not the most expensive, though.
[2876.16 --> 2878.26]  Have I ever told you about the time
[2878.26 --> 2879.40]  I lost my university laptop?
[2879.40 --> 2881.06]  I don't think so.
[2881.44 --> 2881.82]  Oh.
[2883.68 --> 2884.66]  I don't think so.
[2884.92 --> 2886.62]  Well, this is a classic Linus moment.
[2887.58 --> 2890.46]  It was early, and I was getting ready
[2890.46 --> 2891.44]  to commute into school.
[2891.60 --> 2892.74]  So it was quite a drive.
[2892.88 --> 2894.24]  It was even once I was living
[2894.24 --> 2896.80]  with the girlfriend's parents, now wife,
[2898.34 --> 2901.24]  the same person, not separate people.
[2901.88 --> 2903.54]  Once I was living with the girlfriend's parents,
[2903.60 --> 2904.40]  it was still quite a drive.
[2904.40 --> 2905.66]  So it was really early in the morning.
[2906.22 --> 2909.36]  And I had to, like, scrape ice or something
[2909.36 --> 2913.48]  off of the windshield or just, like, condensation frost.
[2914.10 --> 2916.86]  And so I hadn't gotten into the car yet.
[2916.92 --> 2919.16]  I just kind of put my laptop on top of the roof,
[2919.42 --> 2920.14]  did my thing,
[2920.14 --> 2923.04]  and drove away.
[2923.96 --> 2924.36]  Oh.
[2925.10 --> 2926.26]  See you later, laptop.
[2926.42 --> 2927.80]  No idea where it fell off.
[2927.98 --> 2928.26]  Yep.
[2928.58 --> 2932.00]  Yep, that was my Asus M5NE laptop
[2932.00 --> 2935.92]  that I actually DIY built up myself.
[2936.02 --> 2936.76]  It was a bare bones.
[2936.92 --> 2938.06]  So I bought the CPU,
[2938.06 --> 2940.68]  which was actually socketed back in those days.
[2941.12 --> 2942.64]  Picked up some RAM, hard drive,
[2942.80 --> 2945.74]  and I got, like, an extended battery
[2945.74 --> 2948.70]  that was, like, a big booty hump on it
[2948.70 --> 2950.60]  that made it sit up on the table at an angle
[2950.60 --> 2952.40]  but lasted flipping forever.
[2952.94 --> 2954.22]  Actually loved that machine.
[2955.28 --> 2957.24]  Mine was an LG G2.
[2958.14 --> 2959.46]  Yeah, oh, yeah, I know about this one.
[2959.46 --> 2960.78]  I left on a plane.
[2961.50 --> 2962.74]  You knew it, too, right?
[2962.80 --> 2963.76]  And they wouldn't let you back on?
[2963.84 --> 2965.68]  I'm trying to remember the whole story.
[2966.68 --> 2968.52]  I don't fully remember everything.
[2968.60 --> 2969.28]  It's been a long time.
[2969.28 --> 2970.78]  I remember one key part of the story.
[2971.38 --> 2971.68]  What?
[2971.88 --> 2974.16]  The fact that the phone belonged to Linus Media Group.
[2975.58 --> 2976.68]  Yeah, that's very true.
[2978.10 --> 2979.72]  I don't think I've lost anything of my own.
[2979.76 --> 2980.46]  Why would I do that?
[2981.88 --> 2982.24]  Exactly.
[2982.74 --> 2983.30]  Yeah, yeah.
[2984.30 --> 2987.72]  Yeah, I think I got back on the plane
[2987.72 --> 2989.26]  and then it wasn't in the seat pocket
[2989.26 --> 2991.66]  or they said to me it wasn't in the seat pocket.
[2991.78 --> 2993.02]  One of those two things happened.
[2993.66 --> 2994.50]  I don't remember which.
[2995.14 --> 2996.68]  They either let me on, I got to see myself,
[2996.80 --> 2998.84]  or they got someone to go look for me
[2998.84 --> 2999.74]  but they wouldn't let me on.
[2999.80 --> 3000.84]  I don't remember which one happened, though.
[3001.10 --> 3003.50]  But then I had some form of tracking on it.
[3003.58 --> 3005.40]  I don't remember what it was at the time.
[3006.22 --> 3008.50]  And it was like definitely at the airport
[3008.50 --> 3010.48]  and then left the airport
[3010.48 --> 3012.26]  and then disappeared.
[3013.78 --> 3015.78]  So someone definitely grabbed it.
[3019.30 --> 3019.66]  Bummer.
[3020.18 --> 3020.94]  I don't know.
[3020.94 --> 3023.48]  It was like definitely stolen.
[3023.48 --> 3028.12]  For the number of times, though, that I have lost things,
[3028.46 --> 3034.08]  I've had far more times that I've gotten really lucky with things
[3034.08 --> 3037.86]  to the point where I still feel pretty good about my ratio.
[3038.04 --> 3038.38]  Me too.
[3038.38 --> 3041.16]  Like, do you remember the time that one of our camera operators
[3041.16 --> 3044.52]  left an entire duffel bag loaded with camera equipment
[3044.52 --> 3047.56]  just sitting in front of the hotel in Vegas?
[3047.88 --> 3048.24]  Oh, yeah.
[3048.72 --> 3051.44]  And we just all got into the car and left for the airport
[3051.44 --> 3054.04]  and they just left it there
[3054.04 --> 3057.40]  and fortunately someone saw it and turned it back into the hotel
[3057.40 --> 3060.18]  but it was full of like thousands of dollars of camera gear.
[3060.18 --> 3066.28]  And then when that same camera op did the same thing
[3066.28 --> 3067.84]  at an airport in Germany,
[3068.20 --> 3072.92]  just left it in the, like, when you disembark
[3072.92 --> 3076.12]  and haven't gone through customs and everything and security yet,
[3076.36 --> 3078.90]  they left it there and we had crossed through
[3078.90 --> 3081.32]  and we're not allowed to go back to get it.
[3081.74 --> 3083.16]  It was just sitting in an airport,
[3083.34 --> 3086.60]  which is a really good place for an unlabeled bag full of electronics.
[3087.46 --> 3088.94]  When you have a shoot to do
[3088.94 --> 3090.30]  and you need the camera for it,
[3090.36 --> 3092.46]  that was, but we got that one back too.
[3092.64 --> 3094.82]  Fortunately, someone who worked at the airport
[3094.82 --> 3097.44]  knew who we were and was like,
[3097.66 --> 3100.96]  all right, I'll go look for it.
[3101.86 --> 3102.82]  That's always lucky.
[3103.10 --> 3103.96]  That's very lucky.
[3104.10 --> 3105.24]  Yeah, we got very lucky.
[3105.24 --> 3110.36]  I always tend to find that my hip to knee angle
[3110.36 --> 3111.88]  is very unfortunate
[3111.88 --> 3114.28]  and I end up, I'm sitting like this.
[3114.40 --> 3115.14]  These are my hips.
[3115.40 --> 3116.14]  These are my knees.
[3116.36 --> 3118.20]  So things will fall out of my pockets.
[3118.94 --> 3120.76]  And eventually I just got so fed up with it
[3120.76 --> 3123.00]  that I, like, wear these shorts almost exclusively
[3123.00 --> 3124.06]  and they have zipper pockets.
[3124.82 --> 3127.58]  Or, like, the LTT sweatpants.
[3127.72 --> 3128.84]  Those have zipper pockets.
[3129.20 --> 3129.96]  So I'll wear those
[3129.96 --> 3131.90]  because I can at least zip up the pocket.
[3131.90 --> 3135.88]  But there's two times where my wallet
[3135.88 --> 3138.08]  has fallen out of my pocket in a taxi.
[3139.40 --> 3142.44]  And one of them was on a trip.
[3142.76 --> 3145.28]  So I lost all of the receipts that I had for the trip.
[3145.50 --> 3145.98]  Got them.
[3146.08 --> 3146.64]  That sucked.
[3146.78 --> 3147.90]  And I lost everything in my wallet.
[3148.04 --> 3149.40]  But I wasn't carrying cash.
[3149.50 --> 3151.84]  So honestly, the biggest value that was lost
[3151.84 --> 3152.80]  was the receipts.
[3152.80 --> 3155.76]  If I remember correctly,
[3156.62 --> 3160.68]  you got me for it.
[3161.78 --> 3162.70]  But it was like,
[3162.90 --> 3167.24]  you gave me, like, a thing instead of money,
[3167.42 --> 3168.26]  if I remember correctly.
[3168.62 --> 3169.28]  Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
[3169.28 --> 3170.16]  Because you're like, you don't have the receipts.
[3170.24 --> 3171.22]  I can't reimburse the cash.
[3171.22 --> 3172.06]  Yeah, like, legally, I can't.
[3172.06 --> 3172.64]  No, I know, I know.
[3172.66 --> 3173.28]  I'm not complaining.
[3173.28 --> 3175.36]  Well, no, I'm explaining it to them
[3175.36 --> 3177.88]  because sometimes I'll talk about this kind of stuff.
[3177.88 --> 3178.34]  No, this was cool.
[3178.46 --> 3179.62]  I actually appreciated this a lot.
[3179.80 --> 3182.10]  And people will not really understand
[3182.10 --> 3184.46]  how our accounting laws work
[3184.46 --> 3186.14]  and how our labor laws work
[3186.14 --> 3189.52]  because it works some other way over there
[3189.52 --> 3190.14]  or something.
[3190.30 --> 3192.52]  And it's like, no.
[3193.22 --> 3194.80]  If I reimburse this,
[3195.38 --> 3196.82]  and without a receipt,
[3197.04 --> 3198.36]  I have paid him
[3198.36 --> 3200.12]  and he owes income tax on it.
[3200.26 --> 3200.48]  Period.
[3201.04 --> 3201.28]  Like, that's...
[3201.28 --> 3202.28]  So...
[3203.44 --> 3205.54]  If I remember correctly, the deal was...
[3205.54 --> 3207.66]  So we circumvented it a different way.
[3207.76 --> 3208.02]  Yeah.
[3208.48 --> 3209.02]  The deal was...
[3209.02 --> 3210.42]  But he was happy and I was happy.
[3210.78 --> 3213.20]  And it was a business expense.
[3213.20 --> 3216.96]  So it's not like we did anything morally wrong.
[3219.94 --> 3221.46]  If I remember correctly, it was like,
[3221.52 --> 3223.52]  okay, do a video reviewing this thing
[3223.52 --> 3224.66]  and then you can just have it.
[3224.82 --> 3226.02]  I think it was the...
[3226.02 --> 3226.62]  That sounds about right.
[3226.86 --> 3227.94]  Warthog Hotas.
[3228.36 --> 3228.94]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[3229.06 --> 3229.94]  I think that was it.
[3230.00 --> 3230.76]  I don't really remember.
[3231.28 --> 3232.22]  But either way, yeah.
[3232.56 --> 3233.92]  So that was the first one.
[3234.08 --> 3234.88]  And then the next one,
[3235.10 --> 3236.78]  I called the...
[3236.78 --> 3237.50]  It was an Uber.
[3238.04 --> 3239.36]  So I actually had the contact
[3239.36 --> 3240.76]  because the first one was pre-Uber.
[3241.24 --> 3242.62]  So I called the taxi agency
[3242.62 --> 3243.34]  and they were just like,
[3243.72 --> 3244.86]  you're not getting it back.
[3245.12 --> 3246.46]  I was like, okay.
[3247.10 --> 3248.18]  But this one, it was an Uber.
[3248.28 --> 3249.60]  So I actually contacted the Uber guy,
[3249.70 --> 3250.04]  called him.
[3250.30 --> 3252.16]  He was like not doing rides anymore.
[3252.38 --> 3252.60]  Yeah.
[3252.66 --> 3253.82]  But drove all the way back
[3253.82 --> 3255.80]  and then tried to just like leave
[3255.80 --> 3256.72]  after handing it to me.
[3256.74 --> 3257.74]  And I was like, hold on.
[3257.80 --> 3259.14]  I gave him a bunch of cash.
[3259.14 --> 3259.84]  It's like a thank you.
[3259.84 --> 3259.94]  Yeah, cool.
[3260.94 --> 3262.52]  So I made it very worth his while
[3262.52 --> 3263.14]  to drive back.
[3263.22 --> 3264.66]  But he was about to just like
[3264.66 --> 3265.88]  drop off the wallet and take off.
[3266.26 --> 3267.28]  I think I was like, hold on.
[3267.40 --> 3268.26]  You should be paid for this.
[3268.38 --> 3269.18]  I think I left a backpack
[3269.18 --> 3271.10]  on the SkyTrain once or my wallet.
[3272.10 --> 3273.16]  And it made it all the way
[3273.16 --> 3274.08]  to the Terminus station.
[3274.28 --> 3275.30]  And I contacted Translink
[3275.30 --> 3276.10]  and I did get it back.
[3276.18 --> 3276.92]  I think it was my wallet.
[3277.30 --> 3277.58]  Wow.
[3277.58 --> 3279.90]  Yeah, I've been pretty lucky.
[3282.36 --> 3282.72]  Yeah.
[3282.86 --> 3284.02]  But ever since then,
[3284.26 --> 3286.00]  that second time I left my wallet
[3286.00 --> 3286.42]  in the taxi,
[3286.50 --> 3287.14]  I was just like, no.
[3287.84 --> 3288.94]  I like don't travel
[3288.94 --> 3290.08]  without zipper pockets anymore.
[3290.16 --> 3291.40]  Cardinal says, that's not true.
[3291.48 --> 3292.40]  You can use other methods
[3292.40 --> 3293.90]  of substantiation than receipts.
[3294.00 --> 3294.18]  Cool.
[3294.26 --> 3295.20]  But he didn't have them.
[3296.56 --> 3296.92]  Yeah.
[3297.88 --> 3298.80]  Because it was paid.
[3298.80 --> 3299.82]  That was like,
[3300.22 --> 3301.70]  in that era,
[3302.02 --> 3303.46]  this was quite a while ago.
[3303.84 --> 3304.52]  In that era,
[3304.52 --> 3305.88]  I would pay for everything
[3305.88 --> 3306.94]  in cash on trips
[3306.94 --> 3308.22]  because you didn't want
[3308.22 --> 3309.10]  to use credit cards.
[3309.22 --> 3309.76]  Yeah, because then
[3309.76 --> 3311.72]  the exchange sucked.
[3312.14 --> 3312.34]  Yeah.
[3312.54 --> 3312.72]  Yeah.
[3312.76 --> 3313.54]  So the whole move
[3313.54 --> 3314.92]  was before you went on the trip,
[3315.00 --> 3316.12]  you would get cash out
[3316.12 --> 3316.68]  from the bank.
[3316.92 --> 3317.10]  Yeah.
[3317.16 --> 3318.70]  You'd go with cash on your trip.
[3318.78 --> 3320.16]  You'd pay with cash
[3320.16 --> 3321.30]  and then your evidence
[3321.30 --> 3322.04]  would be receipts.
[3322.14 --> 3323.64]  So I had no form of evidence
[3323.64 --> 3324.16]  whatsoever.
[3324.16 --> 3325.14]  Can I just say,
[3325.40 --> 3327.28]  shout out Roam Like Home
[3327.28 --> 3328.70]  cell phone plans
[3328.70 --> 3331.10]  and like reasonable,
[3331.26 --> 3332.14]  like credit cards
[3332.14 --> 3332.98]  and debit cards
[3332.98 --> 3334.16]  with reasonable currency.
[3334.16 --> 3335.06]  Exchange rates.
[3335.14 --> 3335.32]  Yeah.
[3335.54 --> 3337.24]  It's getting so much easier
[3337.24 --> 3337.68]  these days.
[3337.70 --> 3338.32]  But back then,
[3338.36 --> 3339.20]  it was a huge pain.
[3339.54 --> 3340.40]  You'd have to land.
[3340.94 --> 3342.00]  Sorry, before the trip,
[3342.06 --> 3343.14]  you'd have to exchange some money
[3343.14 --> 3343.88]  and then just hope
[3343.88 --> 3344.60]  that you had enough.
[3345.02 --> 3345.96]  You'd have to land.
[3346.54 --> 3347.58]  Immediately upon landing,
[3347.66 --> 3348.40]  you'd have to find a place
[3348.40 --> 3349.24]  that you can buy a SIM.
[3349.74 --> 3350.54]  You'd have to distribute
[3350.54 --> 3351.86]  your new SIM phone number
[3351.86 --> 3352.90]  to everyone that needs it.
[3353.26 --> 3354.18]  Like just all these
[3354.18 --> 3355.90]  like really just annoying steps
[3355.90 --> 3357.06]  that shouldn't honestly
[3357.06 --> 3357.70]  have to happen.
[3357.90 --> 3359.58]  But yeah.
[3361.94 --> 3362.30]  Okay.
[3362.56 --> 3363.62]  Second one I got for you here.
[3363.70 --> 3364.10]  Oh, right.
[3364.10 --> 3365.10]  I didn't even realize
[3365.10 --> 3366.36]  we were doing a merch message anymore.
[3366.48 --> 3367.22]  I had no idea
[3367.22 --> 3368.40]  what started that conversation.
[3368.60 --> 3369.24]  45 tangents.
[3370.82 --> 3371.58]  Hi DL.
[3372.12 --> 3372.86]  Photographer here.
[3373.26 --> 3373.86]  I want to get away
[3373.86 --> 3374.66]  from Dropbox
[3374.66 --> 3375.60]  and set up a NAS
[3375.60 --> 3376.58]  but need backup.
[3377.26 --> 3378.46]  Thought about replicating
[3378.46 --> 3380.00]  my ZFS encrypted
[3380.00 --> 3381.34]  with a friend.
[3381.78 --> 3383.20]  Any tips for properly
[3383.20 --> 3384.44]  baking a NAS
[3384.44 --> 3386.02]  without monthly fees?
[3387.38 --> 3387.94]  Backing.
[3388.24 --> 3388.76]  Backing.
[3389.00 --> 3389.74]  Oh, backing.
[3389.74 --> 3391.44]  So this is something
[3391.44 --> 3393.50]  that does exist.
[3393.50 --> 3394.22]  You can do it
[3394.22 --> 3395.02]  with Synology.
[3396.16 --> 3397.64]  The problem with Synology
[3397.64 --> 3398.30]  is you're stuck
[3398.30 --> 3399.52]  buying their stupid
[3399.52 --> 3400.10]  proprietary
[3400.10 --> 3401.90]  expensive NASs.
[3402.02 --> 3403.06]  So you're effectively
[3403.06 --> 3404.28]  just paying up front
[3404.28 --> 3406.18]  instead of paying
[3406.18 --> 3407.70]  for a monthly subscription
[3407.70 --> 3408.80]  for a cloud service.
[3408.80 --> 3410.20]  and you get to buy
[3410.20 --> 3410.88]  your own drives.
[3411.56 --> 3413.10]  It would be way better
[3413.10 --> 3413.96]  if you could just
[3413.96 --> 3414.98]  build a NAS
[3414.98 --> 3416.28]  using commodity hardware
[3416.28 --> 3417.82]  and then set up features
[3417.82 --> 3419.14]  like that easily
[3419.14 --> 3420.58]  because it has
[3420.58 --> 3421.90]  never made sense to me
[3421.90 --> 3422.46]  that in
[3422.46 --> 3424.16]  present year
[3424.16 --> 3425.62]  it's not the simplest
[3425.62 --> 3426.26]  thing ever
[3426.26 --> 3426.92]  to just
[3426.92 --> 3428.96]  keep the encryption
[3428.96 --> 3429.98]  key for yourself,
[3430.80 --> 3431.76]  send an encrypted
[3431.76 --> 3432.60]  something
[3432.60 --> 3433.80]  over the internet
[3433.80 --> 3434.38]  tubes
[3434.38 --> 3435.54]  and then
[3435.54 --> 3436.44]  have someone else
[3436.44 --> 3436.90]  be like,
[3437.16 --> 3437.36]  hey,
[3437.56 --> 3438.78]  I got you, bro.
[3439.00 --> 3439.64]  Can you back up
[3439.64 --> 3440.56]  some stuff for me?
[3440.70 --> 3441.70]  And then it's just
[3441.70 --> 3442.08]  encrypted
[3442.08 --> 3442.68]  and they have
[3442.68 --> 3443.34]  their own key.
[3443.84 --> 3444.78]  I think we've talked
[3444.78 --> 3445.66]  about this in the past
[3445.66 --> 3446.20]  how there could be
[3446.20 --> 3447.10]  potential liability
[3447.10 --> 3448.62]  around what the data is.
[3448.80 --> 3449.74]  So this is not
[3449.74 --> 3450.36]  legal advice.
[3450.50 --> 3451.38]  Yeah, I probably only
[3451.38 --> 3452.04]  want to do something
[3452.04 --> 3452.80]  like this with
[3452.80 --> 3453.72]  someone that I trust,
[3453.82 --> 3453.96]  you know,
[3453.96 --> 3454.66]  like a lot of things.
[3457.08 --> 3457.52]  But
[3457.52 --> 3459.32]  I would like
[3459.32 --> 3460.00]  something like this
[3460.00 --> 3460.50]  to exist
[3460.50 --> 3461.04]  which is one of
[3461.04 --> 3461.46]  the reasons
[3461.46 --> 3463.26]  that I invested
[3463.26 --> 3464.46]  in a startup
[3464.46 --> 3466.04]  NAS software company.
[3466.28 --> 3467.38]  It's some former
[3467.38 --> 3468.36]  Unraid folks
[3468.36 --> 3469.68]  and I actually
[3469.68 --> 3470.16]  got an update
[3470.16 --> 3471.18]  from them recently.
[3471.82 --> 3472.54]  They're still
[3472.54 --> 3473.46]  busy
[3473.46 --> 3474.72]  beavering away
[3474.72 --> 3476.52]  and
[3476.52 --> 3477.82]  they seemed
[3477.82 --> 3478.66]  very apologetic
[3478.66 --> 3479.24]  when we chatted
[3479.24 --> 3479.94]  last weekend
[3479.94 --> 3480.70]  that like
[3480.70 --> 3481.32]  they hadn't really
[3481.32 --> 3482.00]  said anything
[3482.00 --> 3482.58]  to us
[3482.58 --> 3483.30]  in a long time
[3483.30 --> 3484.56]  and I was like,
[3485.50 --> 3486.38]  nope,
[3486.60 --> 3487.36]  I'm just about
[3487.36 --> 3488.22]  the pacifist
[3488.22 --> 3489.52]  investor
[3489.52 --> 3490.36]  you could possibly
[3490.36 --> 3490.78]  imagine.
[3491.04 --> 3492.82]  I took very much
[3492.82 --> 3493.72]  the same philosophy
[3493.72 --> 3494.48]  with the investment
[3494.48 --> 3494.92]  that I did
[3494.92 --> 3495.52]  with Framework
[3495.52 --> 3496.54]  where I pretty much
[3496.54 --> 3497.94]  wrote a check
[3497.94 --> 3498.62]  which is to say
[3498.62 --> 3499.56]  that I asked
[3499.56 --> 3500.20]  very nicely
[3500.20 --> 3500.76]  for Yvonne
[3500.76 --> 3501.30]  to write me
[3501.30 --> 3501.70]  a check
[3501.70 --> 3503.08]  and then
[3503.08 --> 3503.72]  I kissed
[3503.72 --> 3504.40]  the money goodbye
[3504.40 --> 3506.18]  and if something
[3506.18 --> 3506.76]  comes of it
[3506.76 --> 3507.24]  then great
[3507.24 --> 3508.28]  and if nothing
[3508.28 --> 3508.86]  comes of it
[3508.86 --> 3509.22]  then hey
[3509.22 --> 3509.64]  at least
[3509.64 --> 3512.60]  I did
[3512.60 --> 3513.42]  whatever I
[3513.42 --> 3514.22]  possibly could
[3514.22 --> 3514.68]  have done
[3514.68 --> 3516.56]  to make
[3516.56 --> 3517.08]  this thing
[3517.08 --> 3517.52]  that I think
[3517.52 --> 3518.24]  should exist
[3518.24 --> 3518.60]  exist.
[3518.94 --> 3520.20]  So if
[3520.20 --> 3521.24]  these guys
[3521.24 --> 3522.08]  pull this
[3522.08 --> 3522.46]  off
[3522.46 --> 3523.88]  their software
[3523.88 --> 3524.32]  will be
[3524.32 --> 3525.36]  based on
[3525.36 --> 3526.16]  an existing
[3526.16 --> 3527.28]  excellent
[3527.28 --> 3528.08]  NAS software
[3528.08 --> 3528.88]  that is just
[3528.88 --> 3531.18]  very obtuse
[3531.18 --> 3532.16]  and difficult
[3532.16 --> 3533.96]  for moderate
[3533.96 --> 3535.26]  to low
[3535.26 --> 3536.10]  skill level
[3536.10 --> 3538.76]  people to use
[3538.76 --> 3540.20]  and should
[3540.20 --> 3540.96]  include an
[3540.96 --> 3541.96]  easy version
[3541.96 --> 3543.82]  of shared
[3543.82 --> 3546.94]  co-backup
[3546.94 --> 3547.62]  like that
[3547.62 --> 3548.24]  even with
[3548.24 --> 3548.72]  Synology
[3548.72 --> 3549.28]  I found
[3549.28 --> 3550.02]  setting up
[3550.02 --> 3550.54]  setting up
[3550.54 --> 3551.00]  I found the
[3551.00 --> 3551.42]  process of
[3551.42 --> 3551.96]  setting it up
[3551.96 --> 3552.58]  kind of
[3552.58 --> 3552.92]  difficult
[3552.92 --> 3554.06]  but we did
[3554.06 --> 3554.64]  do a video
[3554.64 --> 3555.10]  about it
[3555.10 --> 3555.80]  at some
[3555.80 --> 3556.12]  point
[3556.12 --> 3557.12]  I have no
[3557.12 --> 3557.56]  idea what
[3557.56 --> 3557.92]  that video
[3557.92 --> 3558.28]  is called
[3558.28 --> 3560.42]  so that's
[3560.42 --> 3561.28]  your best
[3561.28 --> 3561.92]  option for
[3561.92 --> 3562.38]  now in
[3562.38 --> 3562.74]  terms of
[3562.74 --> 3563.22]  something that
[3563.22 --> 3563.68]  is user
[3563.68 --> 3564.38]  friendly enough
[3564.38 --> 3565.78]  that anyone
[3565.78 --> 3566.46]  who's asking
[3566.46 --> 3567.22]  me for advice
[3567.22 --> 3567.64]  about it
[3567.64 --> 3568.16]  could possibly
[3568.16 --> 3568.52]  hope to
[3568.52 --> 3569.02]  follow along
[3569.02 --> 3574.40]  oh right
[3574.40 --> 3575.02]  more topics
[3575.02 --> 3578.08]  account locking
[3578.08 --> 3579.02]  devices
[3579.02 --> 3579.68]  sucks
[3579.68 --> 3581.06]  oh yeah
[3581.06 --> 3582.00]  this is amazing
[3582.00 --> 3582.36]  though
[3582.36 --> 3583.66]  hello did you
[3583.66 --> 3584.20]  leave a printer
[3584.20 --> 3584.94]  here this morning
[3584.94 --> 3585.92]  Monday July 3rd
[3585.92 --> 3587.14]  I got it working
[3587.14 --> 3588.18]  and printed this
[3588.18 --> 3589.28]  but I can't use
[3589.28 --> 3589.64]  some of the
[3589.64 --> 3590.36]  features until
[3590.36 --> 3591.06]  you remove it
[3591.06 --> 3591.82]  from your HP
[3591.82 --> 3592.32]  account
[3592.32 --> 3593.66]  can you please
[3593.66 --> 3594.38]  take a moment
[3594.38 --> 3595.28]  to log in
[3595.28 --> 3596.08]  and remove the
[3596.08 --> 3596.70]  printer from your
[3596.70 --> 3597.14]  account
[3597.14 --> 3598.54]  hpsmart.com
[3598.54 --> 3599.00]  thank you and
[3599.00 --> 3599.42]  have a wonderful
[3599.42 --> 3599.76]  day
[3599.76 --> 3601.08]  done three days
[3601.08 --> 3601.44]  later
[3601.44 --> 3602.32]  enjoy
[3602.32 --> 3603.82]  this is great
[3603.82 --> 3604.62]  and heartwarming
[3604.62 --> 3605.32]  this is from
[3605.32 --> 3605.88]  the LTT
[3605.88 --> 3606.74]  subreddit
[3606.74 --> 3608.64]  but it should
[3608.64 --> 3609.04]  never
[3609.04 --> 3610.54]  be necessary
[3610.54 --> 3611.54]  very happy
[3611.54 --> 3612.24]  that that person
[3612.24 --> 3612.84]  actually did
[3612.84 --> 3613.52]  follow through
[3613.52 --> 3614.12]  and remove it
[3614.12 --> 3614.44]  from their
[3614.44 --> 3614.74]  account
[3614.74 --> 3615.52]  that's great
[3615.52 --> 3616.46]  very cool
[3616.46 --> 3617.58]  but so
[3617.58 --> 3620.78]  many devices
[3620.78 --> 3621.28]  A
[3621.28 --> 3622.12]  won't work
[3622.12 --> 3622.76]  at all
[3622.76 --> 3623.54]  with an
[3623.54 --> 3624.14]  account lock
[3624.14 --> 3624.80]  so you won't
[3624.80 --> 3625.42]  even be able
[3625.42 --> 3627.06]  to get into
[3627.06 --> 3627.56]  it and figure
[3627.56 --> 3628.00]  out what the
[3628.00 --> 3628.54]  problem is
[3628.54 --> 3629.08]  necessarily
[3629.08 --> 3630.50]  and or if
[3630.50 --> 3631.06]  they work
[3631.06 --> 3631.90]  and B
[3631.90 --> 3633.96]  just
[3633.96 --> 3636.34]  even if they
[3636.34 --> 3636.92]  do work a
[3636.92 --> 3637.30]  little bit
[3637.30 --> 3637.96]  no one will
[3637.96 --> 3638.70]  bother to
[3638.70 --> 3640.22]  unlock them
[3640.22 --> 3640.60]  and they will
[3640.60 --> 3641.28]  just end up
[3641.28 --> 3642.00]  being either
[3642.00 --> 3643.08]  complete e-waste
[3643.08 --> 3644.12]  or partial
[3644.12 --> 3644.74]  e-waste
[3644.74 --> 3646.28]  and I just
[3646.28 --> 3647.72]  I guess what I'm
[3647.72 --> 3648.16]  trying to say
[3648.16 --> 3648.64]  is I don't
[3648.64 --> 3649.44]  understand why
[3649.44 --> 3652.66]  it added cost
[3652.66 --> 3653.46]  to this printer
[3653.46 --> 3654.30]  for HP
[3654.30 --> 3655.06]  to implement
[3655.06 --> 3657.82]  the smart
[3657.82 --> 3658.44]  hardware
[3658.44 --> 3659.02]  to make this
[3659.02 --> 3659.42]  possible
[3659.42 --> 3660.10]  what does it do
[3660.10 --> 3661.16]  I mean that's a good
[3661.16 --> 3661.56]  question
[3661.56 --> 3662.14]  you know what
[3662.14 --> 3662.76]  maybe that's part
[3662.76 --> 3662.98]  of it
[3662.98 --> 3664.20]  is I
[3664.20 --> 3664.88]  I don't
[3664.88 --> 3666.02]  I don't
[3666.02 --> 3666.70]  learn about
[3666.70 --> 3667.20]  printers
[3667.20 --> 3669.02]  or buy printers
[3669.02 --> 3670.26]  anytime other than
[3670.26 --> 3671.12]  when I absolutely
[3671.12 --> 3672.32]  am forced to
[3672.32 --> 3672.74]  yeah
[3672.74 --> 3673.60]  so
[3673.60 --> 3674.88]  sure
[3674.88 --> 3676.00]  what does it do
[3676.00 --> 3676.42]  help me out
[3676.42 --> 3677.22]  oh the disaster
[3677.22 --> 3678.20]  recovery guide
[3678.20 --> 3680.52]  which is like
[3680.52 --> 3681.92]  over 200 pages
[3681.92 --> 3683.16]  oh our internal
[3683.16 --> 3684.16]  disaster recovery
[3684.16 --> 3684.50]  yeah
[3684.50 --> 3685.44]  like documentation
[3685.44 --> 3686.34]  for if bad
[3686.34 --> 3686.90]  stuff happens
[3686.90 --> 3687.22]  yeah
[3687.22 --> 3687.70]  yes
[3687.70 --> 3688.14]  we're probably
[3688.14 --> 3688.86]  gonna print it
[3688.86 --> 3691.38]  like probably
[3691.38 --> 3692.68]  around four times
[3692.68 --> 3693.96]  why
[3693.96 --> 3695.74]  if the internet
[3695.74 --> 3696.52]  is out
[3696.52 --> 3697.32]  we should probably
[3697.32 --> 3697.84]  be able to
[3697.84 --> 3698.50]  access it
[3698.50 --> 3700.74]  you mean the
[3700.74 --> 3701.48]  whole internet
[3701.48 --> 3702.48]  like mobile data
[3702.48 --> 3702.76]  too
[3702.76 --> 3703.14]  sure
[3703.14 --> 3704.06]  I mean
[3704.06 --> 3705.92]  it's disasters
[3705.92 --> 3706.30]  man
[3706.30 --> 3708.16]  there's
[3708.16 --> 3708.80]  contingencies
[3708.80 --> 3709.34]  in there
[3709.34 --> 3710.26]  for like
[3710.26 --> 3711.66]  if this
[3711.66 --> 3712.32]  area
[3712.32 --> 3713.48]  is gone
[3713.48 --> 3714.38]  okay
[3714.38 --> 3714.80]  yeah
[3714.80 --> 3715.20]  that's
[3715.20 --> 3715.54]  fair
[3715.54 --> 3718.08]  yeah
[3718.08 --> 3718.66]  you're not
[3718.66 --> 3719.06]  wrong
[3719.06 --> 3721.40]  we're currently
[3721.40 --> 3722.24]  effectively trying to
[3722.24 --> 3722.64]  figure out like
[3722.64 --> 3723.44]  how many copies
[3723.44 --> 3724.04]  do we need
[3724.04 --> 3724.68]  one of the
[3724.68 --> 3725.26]  theories is
[3725.26 --> 3726.20]  one for each
[3726.20 --> 3726.82]  server room
[3726.82 --> 3727.76]  and then one
[3727.76 --> 3728.16]  at each one
[3728.16 --> 3728.78]  of our houses
[3728.78 --> 3731.06]  but that might
[3731.06 --> 3731.52]  be a lot
[3731.52 --> 3732.28]  I think one's
[3732.28 --> 3732.90]  probably okay
[3732.90 --> 3733.40]  it's probably
[3733.40 --> 3733.60]  all right
[3733.60 --> 3734.78]  you said 200
[3734.78 --> 3735.20]  pages
[3735.20 --> 3736.20]  it's big
[3736.20 --> 3736.64]  yeah
[3736.64 --> 3737.10]  a lot
[3737.10 --> 3737.30]  of it
[3737.30 --> 3737.56]  will be
[3737.56 --> 3737.92]  blank
[3737.92 --> 3740.56]  not a
[3740.56 --> 3741.10]  whole blank
[3741.10 --> 3741.62]  page but
[3741.62 --> 3742.10]  there's like a
[3742.10 --> 3742.76]  lot of unused
[3742.76 --> 3743.48]  space on some
[3743.48 --> 3743.98]  of the pages
[3743.98 --> 3745.08]  yeah I think
[3745.08 --> 3745.80]  if we I think
[3745.80 --> 3746.24]  if we went
[3746.24 --> 3746.94]  with one copy
[3746.94 --> 3747.52]  that's probably
[3747.52 --> 3747.86]  okay
[3747.86 --> 3748.40]  yeah
[3748.40 --> 3749.58]  chat's all
[3749.58 --> 3749.86]  mad
[3749.86 --> 3750.68]  not one
[3750.68 --> 3751.02]  more than
[3751.02 --> 3751.24]  one
[3751.24 --> 3753.00]  okay how
[3753.00 --> 3753.44]  about this
[3753.44 --> 3754.16]  one and we
[3754.16 --> 3755.12]  laminate it
[3755.12 --> 3756.10]  hey
[3756.10 --> 3756.84]  take that
[3756.84 --> 3757.38]  environment
[3757.38 --> 3759.66]  who needs
[3759.66 --> 3760.38]  microplastics
[3760.38 --> 3761.10]  we can have
[3761.10 --> 3762.22]  macroplastics
[3762.22 --> 3762.84]  who wrote
[3762.84 --> 3763.02]  it
[3763.02 --> 3763.46]  uh
[3763.46 --> 3763.94]  uh
[3763.94 --> 3764.54]  Sean
[3764.54 --> 3765.22]  uh
[3765.22 --> 3765.74]  also known as
[3765.74 --> 3766.26]  Whaler on the
[3766.26 --> 3766.48]  forum
[3766.48 --> 3767.76]  new IT guy
[3767.76 --> 3769.24]  sick
[3769.24 --> 3769.78]  all right
[3769.78 --> 3770.20]  it's good
[3770.20 --> 3771.38]  two and laminate
[3771.38 --> 3771.66]  both
[3771.66 --> 3772.00]  I'm not
[3772.00 --> 3772.90]  negotiating with
[3772.90 --> 3773.36]  you guys
[3773.36 --> 3774.36]  this is
[3774.36 --> 3775.16]  this is not
[3775.16 --> 3776.86]  it's like
[3776.86 --> 3777.62]  genuinely
[3777.62 --> 3778.68]  not up to
[3778.68 --> 3778.86]  chat
[3778.86 --> 3779.98]  at all
[3779.98 --> 3782.32]  it's actually
[3782.32 --> 3782.96]  up to him
[3782.96 --> 3783.38]  I'm just
[3783.38 --> 3783.86]  giving my
[3783.86 --> 3784.26]  opinion
[3784.26 --> 3786.16]  which is
[3786.16 --> 3786.74]  pretty solid
[3786.74 --> 3787.54]  um
[3787.54 --> 3789.28]  Microsoft
[3789.28 --> 3791.26]  finally does it
[3791.26 --> 3791.46]  will you feel
[3791.46 --> 3792.00]  better having
[3792.00 --> 3792.48]  one at your
[3792.48 --> 3792.82]  house
[3792.82 --> 3794.14]  uh no
[3794.14 --> 3795.32]  are you sure
[3795.32 --> 3795.70]  yeah
[3795.70 --> 3796.70]  what if
[3796.70 --> 3797.40]  something super
[3797.40 --> 3798.12]  bad happened
[3798.12 --> 3799.34]  and you had
[3799.34 --> 3799.78]  no way to
[3799.78 --> 3800.34]  access the
[3800.34 --> 3800.50]  internet
[3800.50 --> 3800.72]  I'll walk
[3800.72 --> 3801.18]  to work
[3801.18 --> 3802.00]  let's go
[3802.00 --> 3806.34]  couldn't take
[3806.34 --> 3806.96]  that long
[3806.96 --> 3808.54]  I mean
[3808.54 --> 3809.02]  realistically
[3809.02 --> 3809.50]  what else
[3809.50 --> 3809.84]  am I gonna
[3809.84 --> 3809.98]  do
[3809.98 --> 3810.52]  my family's
[3810.52 --> 3810.96]  all dead
[3810.96 --> 3817.86]  all right
[3817.86 --> 3818.84]  I mean
[3818.84 --> 3819.36]  there's also
[3819.36 --> 3819.74]  like
[3819.74 --> 3820.36]  what if
[3820.36 --> 3820.76]  what if
[3820.76 --> 3821.02]  you know
[3821.02 --> 3821.24]  like
[3821.24 --> 3821.80]  google drive
[3821.80 --> 3822.28]  is down
[3822.28 --> 3822.80]  or something
[3822.80 --> 3823.46]  like there's
[3823.46 --> 3823.94]  other ways
[3823.94 --> 3824.16]  that you
[3824.16 --> 3824.54]  could lose
[3824.54 --> 3825.16]  access to
[3825.16 --> 3825.28]  it
[3825.28 --> 3825.50]  without
[3825.50 --> 3826.62]  every form
[3826.62 --> 3827.00]  of internet
[3827.00 --> 3827.64]  being down
[3827.64 --> 3828.74]  three two
[3828.74 --> 3828.90]  one
[3828.90 --> 3829.22]  backup
[3829.22 --> 3829.80]  I know
[3829.80 --> 3831.92]  it's fine
[3831.92 --> 3832.38]  it's up to
[3832.38 --> 3832.64]  you
[3832.64 --> 3833.42]  it's up
[3833.42 --> 3833.72]  to you
[3833.72 --> 3834.00]  okay
[3834.00 --> 3835.72]  all right
[3835.72 --> 3836.52]  I made a video
[3836.52 --> 3837.06]  on that
[3837.06 --> 3838.02]  like actually
[3838.02 --> 3839.06]  almost a decade
[3839.06 --> 3839.48]  ago
[3839.48 --> 3840.28]  at this point
[3840.28 --> 3840.72]  yeah so
[3840.72 --> 3841.20]  that's why
[3841.20 --> 3841.78]  he's forgotten
[3841.78 --> 3843.02]  oh my god
[3843.02 --> 3844.80]  there are
[3844.80 --> 3845.44]  things that
[3845.44 --> 3846.54]  I made videos
[3846.54 --> 3847.22]  on that long
[3847.22 --> 3847.92]  ago that I've
[3847.92 --> 3848.70]  definitely forgotten
[3848.70 --> 3849.48]  but that's
[3849.48 --> 3850.06]  not one of them
[3850.06 --> 3850.54]  yeah like
[3850.54 --> 3851.06]  he's not very
[3851.06 --> 3851.58]  good at hiding
[3851.58 --> 3852.36]  his porn anymore
[3852.36 --> 3855.28]  that video
[3855.28 --> 3856.14]  is so bad
[3856.14 --> 3857.90]  no it's great
[3857.90 --> 3858.68]  it's actually
[3858.68 --> 3859.38]  so good
[3859.38 --> 3860.82]  we we have
[3860.82 --> 3861.58]  made some
[3861.58 --> 3863.06]  very questionable
[3863.06 --> 3864.52]  content choices
[3864.52 --> 3865.28]  over the years
[3865.28 --> 3865.82]  oh it's
[3865.82 --> 3866.78]  very questionable
[3866.78 --> 3867.54]  but it's actually
[3867.54 --> 3868.10]  a pretty good
[3868.10 --> 3868.44]  video
[3868.44 --> 3869.08]  yeah
[3869.08 --> 3870.28]  I mean it's
[3870.28 --> 3871.46]  it's it's not
[3871.46 --> 3872.10]  inaccurate
[3872.10 --> 3873.16]  no I'll give you
[3873.16 --> 3873.52]  that
[3873.52 --> 3873.84]  yeah
[3873.84 --> 3874.70]  um and it's
[3874.70 --> 3875.58]  very funny
[3875.58 --> 3879.24]  sounds good to me
[3879.24 --> 3880.62]  c-colon slash
[3880.62 --> 3880.88]  temp
[3880.88 --> 3881.60]  yep yep
[3881.60 --> 3882.58]  yep we've got a
[3882.58 --> 3883.22]  man of culture
[3883.22 --> 3883.58]  here
[3883.58 --> 3884.90]  um all right
[3884.90 --> 3886.02]  Microsoft
[3886.02 --> 3887.34]  has finally done
[3887.34 --> 3887.86]  it they have
[3887.86 --> 3888.82]  closed their
[3888.82 --> 3890.06]  69 billion
[3890.06 --> 3890.76]  dollar purchase
[3890.76 --> 3891.64]  of Activision Blizzard
[3891.64 --> 3892.68]  King nearly
[3892.68 --> 3893.72]  two years
[3893.72 --> 3894.62]  is that how long
[3894.62 --> 3895.08]  this has been
[3895.08 --> 3895.86]  dragging out for
[3895.86 --> 3898.42]  makes sense why
[3898.42 --> 3899.06]  it feels like it's
[3899.06 --> 3899.88]  been absolutely
[3899.88 --> 3900.80]  forever then
[3900.80 --> 3902.44]  uh the UK's
[3902.44 --> 3903.40]  competition and
[3903.40 --> 3904.48]  markets authority
[3904.48 --> 3905.32]  approved an
[3905.32 --> 3906.20]  altered deal
[3906.20 --> 3907.06]  where gamers
[3907.06 --> 3907.60]  within the
[3907.60 --> 3908.46]  European economic
[3908.46 --> 3909.02]  area
[3909.02 --> 3909.62]  so that's the
[3909.62 --> 3910.38]  EU plus three
[3910.38 --> 3910.90]  other countries
[3910.90 --> 3911.82]  who purchase
[3911.82 --> 3913.00]  current and future
[3913.00 --> 3913.86]  Activision games
[3913.86 --> 3914.46]  will have the
[3914.46 --> 3915.36]  right to stream
[3915.36 --> 3916.60]  them on whatever
[3916.60 --> 3918.08]  service they want
[3918.08 --> 3919.92]  while Ubisoft
[3919.92 --> 3921.28]  will hold the
[3921.28 --> 3922.40]  cloud gaming rights
[3922.40 --> 3923.02]  to current
[3923.02 --> 3923.96]  Activision games
[3923.96 --> 3924.90]  and those made
[3924.90 --> 3925.46]  over the next
[3925.46 --> 3926.40]  15 years
[3926.40 --> 3928.18]  everywhere else
[3928.18 --> 3930.02]  what?
[3931.02 --> 3931.82]  huh?
[3934.98 --> 3935.94]  what?
[3935.94 --> 3938.38]  this means
[3938.38 --> 3939.38]  that while
[3939.38 --> 3940.30]  Microsoft will
[3940.30 --> 3941.40]  own the games
[3941.40 --> 3942.36]  they will have
[3942.36 --> 3943.28]  to get permission
[3943.28 --> 3944.64]  and pay a
[3944.64 --> 3945.50]  license fee
[3945.50 --> 3947.30]  to Ubisoft
[3947.30 --> 3948.44]  in order to
[3948.44 --> 3949.02]  add them to
[3949.02 --> 3950.28]  Xbox Game Pass
[3950.28 --> 3951.50]  or any other
[3951.50 --> 3952.90]  streaming service
[3952.90 --> 3954.78]  why Ubisoft?
[3954.78 --> 3957.30]  I am sure
[3957.30 --> 3958.26]  that somebody
[3958.26 --> 3960.34]  knows that
[3960.34 --> 3961.68]  but it isn't
[3961.68 --> 3962.56]  us and it
[3962.56 --> 3963.20]  isn't anyone
[3963.20 --> 3963.94]  in our chat
[3963.94 --> 3967.72]  what?
[3969.10 --> 3970.02]  can I just
[3970.02 --> 3970.52]  put on my
[3970.52 --> 3971.24]  tinfoil hat
[3971.24 --> 3971.80]  for a second
[3971.80 --> 3972.48]  here is it
[3972.48 --> 3973.26]  is it that
[3973.26 --> 3974.68]  is it that
[3974.68 --> 3975.30]  maybe
[3975.30 --> 3977.48]  Ubisoft
[3977.48 --> 3978.76]  um
[3978.76 --> 3979.42]  okay hold on
[3979.42 --> 3979.88]  now I'm trying
[3979.88 --> 3980.44]  really hard
[3980.44 --> 3980.76]  I really don't
[3980.76 --> 3981.16]  get it because
[3981.16 --> 3982.04]  someone's like
[3982.04 --> 3983.52]  Ubisoft is French
[3983.52 --> 3984.48]  and this is a
[3984.48 --> 3985.44]  European thing
[3985.44 --> 3986.12]  so maybe they
[3986.12 --> 3986.74]  found a French
[3986.74 --> 3987.38]  gaming company
[3987.38 --> 3988.28]  but isn't like
[3988.28 --> 3988.86]  a massive
[3988.86 --> 3989.50]  percentage of
[3989.50 --> 3990.08]  Ubisoft owned
[3990.08 --> 3990.80]  by Tencent?
[3993.70 --> 3994.70]  I mean I
[3994.70 --> 3995.18]  don't know
[3995.18 --> 3996.46]  I this makes
[3996.46 --> 3997.58]  absolutely no
[3997.58 --> 3998.16]  sense to me
[3998.16 --> 3998.80]  whatsoever I mean
[3998.80 --> 3999.48]  everything about
[3999.48 --> 4000.96]  it the fact that
[4000.96 --> 4001.98]  this is a 15
[4001.98 --> 4002.68]  year thing I mean
[4002.68 --> 4003.66]  Microsoft is a
[4003.66 --> 4004.40]  company that
[4004.40 --> 4007.28]  thinks in 10
[4007.28 --> 4008.38]  plus year terms
[4008.38 --> 4009.94]  um this this
[4009.94 --> 4011.34]  makes effectively
[4011.34 --> 4012.70]  no difference as
[4012.70 --> 4013.42]  far as I can
[4013.42 --> 4014.06]  tell like yeah
[4014.06 --> 4014.98]  it's a short
[4014.98 --> 4016.02]  term inconvenience
[4016.02 --> 4016.46]  but in the
[4016.46 --> 4017.12]  long term
[4017.12 --> 4018.56]  Microsoft will
[4018.56 --> 4019.60]  just own all
[4019.60 --> 4020.64]  of those IPs
[4020.64 --> 4022.18]  and all of the
[4022.18 --> 4022.78]  streaming rights
[4022.78 --> 4023.20]  because there's
[4023.20 --> 4023.56]  no way they're
[4023.56 --> 4024.02]  going to renew
[4024.02 --> 4024.56]  this deal
[4024.56 --> 4025.30]  here's a spicy
[4025.30 --> 4026.74]  question would
[4026.74 --> 4027.12]  you prefer
[4027.12 --> 4027.88]  Microsoft or
[4027.88 --> 4028.36]  would you prefer
[4028.36 --> 4028.80]  Tencent?
[4029.52 --> 4030.12]  because they're
[4030.12 --> 4031.40]  both trying to
[4031.40 --> 4031.90]  accomplish the
[4031.90 --> 4032.56]  same thing and
[4032.56 --> 4033.10]  no one really
[4033.10 --> 4033.76]  seems to talk
[4033.76 --> 4034.40]  about the Tencent
[4034.40 --> 4035.32]  side of this but
[4035.32 --> 4036.08]  everyone's super
[4036.08 --> 4036.64]  pissed about the
[4036.64 --> 4037.40]  Microsoft side of
[4037.40 --> 4038.58]  this and in my
[4038.58 --> 4039.18]  opinion if we're
[4039.18 --> 4039.66]  going to be super
[4039.66 --> 4040.30]  pissed about it we
[4040.30 --> 4040.84]  should be super
[4040.84 --> 4041.30]  pissed at the
[4041.30 --> 4041.74]  whole thing
[4041.74 --> 4042.88]  well yeah I
[4042.88 --> 4043.70]  mean we talk
[4043.70 --> 4044.42]  about consolidation
[4044.42 --> 4045.42]  in general terms
[4045.42 --> 4046.00]  and I don't think
[4046.00 --> 4047.20]  anyone's happy about
[4047.20 --> 4048.32]  Tencent having their
[4048.32 --> 4049.42]  fingers in just about
[4049.42 --> 4049.86]  everything
[4049.86 --> 4052.24]  it's like way worse
[4052.24 --> 4052.74]  in my opinion
[4052.74 --> 4053.70]  the Logitech G
[4053.70 --> 4054.52]  cloud was something
[4054.52 --> 4055.36]  I was really
[4055.36 --> 4056.60]  surprised to find a
[4056.60 --> 4057.68]  Tencent end user
[4057.68 --> 4058.68]  license agreement in
[4058.68 --> 4059.32]  and I talked about
[4059.32 --> 4060.24]  that in my review of
[4060.24 --> 4060.76]  it I'm sitting here
[4060.76 --> 4062.64]  going sorry what I
[4062.64 --> 4063.66]  have to agree to a
[4063.66 --> 4065.52]  Tencent license
[4065.52 --> 4066.46]  agreement in order to
[4066.46 --> 4067.58]  turn on this device
[4067.58 --> 4068.98]  I don't know if that's
[4068.98 --> 4070.14]  the case anymore but
[4070.14 --> 4071.68]  it's definitely was
[4071.68 --> 4072.64]  when I did my review
[4072.64 --> 4077.02]  yeah I don't know
[4077.02 --> 4078.44]  Ubisoft has the
[4078.44 --> 4079.36]  increase in came
[4079.36 --> 4081.92]  yeah a number of
[4081.92 --> 4082.92]  companies wanted the
[4082.92 --> 4083.68]  cloud gaming rights
[4083.68 --> 4084.18]  for Actors and
[4084.18 --> 4084.88]  Blizzard games and
[4084.88 --> 4085.52]  had to essentially
[4085.52 --> 4087.12]  pitch the competition
[4087.12 --> 4088.02]  markets authority in
[4088.02 --> 4089.64]  the UK the interview
[4089.64 --> 4090.66]  like process meant the
[4090.66 --> 4091.98]  CMA picked out the
[4091.98 --> 4092.82]  companies that would
[4092.82 --> 4093.90]  work best with its
[4093.90 --> 4094.82]  concerns over cloud
[4094.82 --> 4096.12]  gaming and then it was
[4096.12 --> 4097.18]  up to Microsoft to
[4097.18 --> 4098.48]  ultimately decide on
[4098.48 --> 4099.30]  which company to
[4099.30 --> 4100.10]  restructure its deal
[4100.10 --> 4105.30]  with okay so there
[4105.30 --> 4106.36]  was there was a
[4106.36 --> 4109.42]  process here but it
[4109.42 --> 4110.76]  doesn't make it feel
[4110.76 --> 4112.02]  any less kind of
[4112.02 --> 4113.00]  still seems weird as
[4113.00 --> 4114.24]  heck roundabout and
[4114.24 --> 4116.08]  whack yeah do we do
[4116.08 --> 4117.06]  we use the word whack
[4117.06 --> 4118.36]  still I don't know I
[4118.36 --> 4119.78]  think it's whack yeah
[4119.78 --> 4120.84]  this whole thing yeah
[4120.84 --> 4123.04]  there yeah it's whack
[4123.04 --> 4124.02]  yeah you can you can
[4124.02 --> 4125.38]  quote me on that yeah
[4125.38 --> 4128.92]  the Microsoft
[4128.92 --> 4130.44]  Activision Ubisoft
[4130.44 --> 4131.86]  three-way thing here
[4131.86 --> 4133.20]  it's whack
[4133.20 --> 4137.78]  so in summary
[4137.78 --> 4139.96]  Microsoft will own the
[4139.96 --> 4141.30]  games but they will
[4141.30 --> 4142.16]  have to oh no I
[4142.16 --> 4143.12]  already said this
[4143.12 --> 4144.84]  presumably Europeans
[4144.84 --> 4145.82]  will be limited by what
[4145.82 --> 4146.68]  service has made
[4146.68 --> 4147.42]  available but then
[4147.42 --> 4148.50]  logistics okay the
[4148.50 --> 4150.88]  FTC however says it is
[4150.88 --> 4152.00]  still planning on
[4152.00 --> 4152.74]  challenging the
[4152.74 --> 4153.92]  acquisition and will be
[4153.92 --> 4155.24]  submitting an argument to
[4155.24 --> 4156.42]  an appeals court in
[4156.42 --> 4159.38]  December according to
[4159.38 --> 4160.86]  the terms of the now
[4160.86 --> 4162.00]  finalized but I don't
[4162.00 --> 4162.84]  know the FTC might
[4162.84 --> 4164.36]  challenge it deal
[4164.36 --> 4165.98]  Activision CEO Bobby
[4165.98 --> 4167.28]  Kotick will remain at the
[4167.28 --> 4168.44]  company until the end of
[4168.44 --> 4169.78]  this year to facilitate a
[4169.78 --> 4171.04]  smooth transition after
[4171.04 --> 4172.02]  which he's set to leave
[4172.02 --> 4174.04]  so at least Luke gets
[4174.04 --> 4175.26]  one of his big asks
[4175.26 --> 4176.72]  which is to get Bobby
[4176.72 --> 4178.62]  Kotick out of Activision
[4178.62 --> 4181.46]  Blizzard King that's great
[4181.46 --> 4182.70]  in other news Sony has
[4182.70 --> 4183.66]  announced that they are
[4183.66 --> 4185.54]  launching a PS5 cloud
[4185.54 --> 4186.74]  streaming service later
[4186.74 --> 4187.92]  this month though at
[4187.92 --> 4190.58]  launch they're launching
[4190.58 --> 4192.52]  PS5 cloud streaming later
[4192.52 --> 4193.32]  this month though at
[4193.32 --> 4194.46]  launch these titles will
[4194.46 --> 4195.52]  only be available to stream
[4195.52 --> 4196.74]  on a PS5 console which
[4196.74 --> 4197.56]  titles okay I don't know
[4197.56 --> 4198.12]  my notes are a little
[4198.12 --> 4199.36]  weird here Microsoft
[4199.36 --> 4200.30]  meanwhile currently
[4200.30 --> 4201.64]  controls an estimated 60
[4201.64 --> 4203.04]  to 70 percent of cloud
[4203.04 --> 4205.94]  gaming our discussion
[4205.94 --> 4207.30]  question is in an
[4207.30 --> 4208.38]  industry where console
[4208.38 --> 4209.60]  gaming is becoming less and
[4209.60 --> 4210.72]  less important is
[4210.72 --> 4211.98]  Microsoft's expansion into
[4211.98 --> 4212.98]  cloud gaming a genuine
[4212.98 --> 4214.06]  threat so first of all I
[4214.06 --> 4215.22]  think console gaming is
[4215.22 --> 4216.72]  actually still very important
[4216.72 --> 4219.04]  and so does Microsoft but it
[4219.04 --> 4220.74]  is also very clear that
[4220.74 --> 4222.48]  Microsoft sees cloud and
[4222.48 --> 4224.60]  console gaming as things
[4224.60 --> 4226.32]  that go hand in hand because
[4226.32 --> 4229.04]  a console is one of the best
[4229.04 --> 4230.54]  understood by the general
[4230.54 --> 4232.66]  consumer ways of getting a
[4232.66 --> 4234.58]  cloud streaming device into
[4234.58 --> 4236.42]  someone's house and hooked up
[4236.42 --> 4243.42]  to their TV yeah yes Microsoft's
[4243.42 --> 4245.26]  expansion into cloud gaming is a
[4245.26 --> 4246.74]  genuine threat they're the only
[4246.74 --> 4250.92]  credible player that is that has a
[4250.92 --> 4252.44]  significant foothold in the space
[4252.44 --> 4254.74]  I mean Stadia disappeared Luna
[4254.74 --> 4257.06]  when's the last time Amazon Luna
[4257.06 --> 4260.28]  crossed your mind I barely even
[4260.28 --> 4262.02]  remember that that existed well it's
[4262.02 --> 4264.18]  not in Canada so that might be one
[4264.18 --> 4265.84]  reason like I wanted to do a video
[4265.84 --> 4268.42]  I've heard of this but yeah here
[4268.42 --> 4270.48]  Luke laptop screen up yeah yeah
[4270.48 --> 4272.88]  Amazon Luna cloud gaming service
[4272.88 --> 4275.34]  Sonic and whatever that is oh that's
[4275.34 --> 4277.44]  fortnight now I figured it out I
[4277.44 --> 4278.82]  figured it out you got there
[4278.82 --> 4285.18]  yeah so Ubisoft makes another
[4285.18 --> 4288.30]  appearance in this topic yeah that's
[4288.30 --> 4292.20]  something Jackbox games are fun yeah
[4292.20 --> 4295.52]  but really that's one of their four
[4295.52 --> 4297.08]  highlight things that I'm sure if they
[4297.08 --> 4298.46]  had six highlight things they would
[4298.46 --> 4300.78]  have populated the spots definitely
[4300.78 --> 4303.36]  some aspirational space here yeah the
[4303.36 --> 4304.98]  prime the prime gaming one not even
[4304.98 --> 4310.92]  having eight titles now I'm looking to
[4310.92 --> 4312.72]  see if there's any duplicate ones across
[4312.72 --> 4316.38]  here and then actually I'm sorry I need
[4316.38 --> 4318.24]  to see what this B game is it doesn't
[4318.24 --> 4319.74]  have Jerry Seinfeld why does it look
[4319.74 --> 4323.22]  like Netflix B simulator does the does
[4323.22 --> 4331.14]  the B date someone local PVP metascore 58
[4331.14 --> 4335.28]  oh yeah that's they display that was
[4335.28 --> 4341.76]  that interesting so they hmm hey hey
[4341.76 --> 4344.94]  you want our games they're junk wow
[4344.94 --> 4348.06]  this is a B tier game from four years
[4348.06 --> 4351.18]  ago and that's on the front page oh my
[4351.18 --> 4352.14]  really you're not going to acknowledge
[4352.14 --> 4356.76]  that at all what oh it's pretty good
[4356.76 --> 4359.04]  that took me a second no it was good
[4359.04 --> 4361.32]  it was good are you still poking around
[4361.32 --> 4363.44]  in there I was but I don't think it's
[4363.44 --> 4364.50]  really worth it all right completely
[4364.50 --> 4364.98]  honest
[4364.98 --> 4371.18]  B tier hey you want to play every
[4371.18 --> 4373.44]  single Ubisoft game that are all the
[4373.44 --> 4375.18]  same but with different skins on them
[4375.18 --> 4377.38]  oh okay are you still poking around at
[4377.38 --> 4379.54]  it no I'm just salty about Ubisoft no
[4379.54 --> 4381.96]  Ubisoft has other games oh do they
[4381.96 --> 4384.82]  wow which which tower simulator game do you
[4384.82 --> 4386.44]  want to play okay oh this is just an
[4386.44 --> 4388.22]  alphabetical order this makes sense
[4388.22 --> 4391.16]  that is wow it seems like a bad way to
[4391.16 --> 4394.52]  do that it really really truly does
[4394.52 --> 4399.22]  doesn't it wow I mean Far Cry you know I
[4399.22 --> 4401.68]  haven't played one since the second one
[4401.68 --> 4404.62]  like exactly the same just with skins
[4404.62 --> 4406.48]  that's that's the comment I was making
[4406.48 --> 4409.30]  but Monopoly is different Monopoly is
[4409.30 --> 4411.02]  different Monopoly is just too close to
[4411.02 --> 4412.20]  real life now though I don't think
[4412.20 --> 4413.52]  people like playing that game anymore
[4413.52 --> 4414.66]  yeah it's a little depressing
[4414.66 --> 4418.86]  oh wow Ubisoft doesn't have that many
[4418.86 --> 4422.26]  games they have watchdogs and they have
[4422.26 --> 4424.16]  Far Cry and they have Assassin's Creed
[4424.16 --> 4426.12]  which are all the same thing is Ghost
[4426.12 --> 4429.64]  Recon still relevant at all it's the last
[4429.64 --> 4430.48]  time I played it
[4430.48 --> 4436.04]  I angrily refunded within the two-hour
[4436.04 --> 4439.04]  window really the last Ghost Recon I
[4439.04 --> 4442.14]  played yeah hmm okay I disliked it quite
[4442.14 --> 4446.82]  heavily all right I don't remember why I
[4446.82 --> 4449.14]  think was it this one is it because
[4449.14 --> 4451.98]  you're a salty gamer was it Wildlands no
[4451.98 --> 4454.14]  because I thought I was for a long time
[4454.14 --> 4457.50]  and then a few recent games came out and
[4457.50 --> 4460.68]  I was like maybe I'm not maybe I'm not
[4460.68 --> 4462.54]  the one who's wrong there's a lot of
[4462.54 --> 4464.94]  Ubisoft published titles that are
[4464.94 --> 4466.70]  definitely not in that list which is
[4466.70 --> 4469.48]  interesting mm-hmm like I know people are
[4469.48 --> 4471.22]  people are actually pointing out in chat
[4471.22 --> 4474.76]  games that are not there but hey you
[4474.76 --> 4478.40]  can play Uno you can you can definitely
[4478.40 --> 4481.92]  play Uno and oh there's Trackmania and
[4481.92 --> 4483.32]  I've actually heard a lot of very
[4483.32 --> 4484.74]  positive things about Trackmania I've
[4484.74 --> 4486.36]  never played it myself yeah but the thing
[4486.36 --> 4488.74]  is if there's only that many games aren't
[4488.74 --> 4490.38]  you better off just buying those games
[4490.38 --> 4491.48]  instead of signing up for a
[4491.48 --> 4494.34]  subscription service I've kind of he's
[4494.34 --> 4496.34]  baiting me right now I think that's true
[4496.34 --> 4498.16]  anyways for like a multitude of reasons
[4498.16 --> 4500.28]  it's also better for the developers in a
[4500.28 --> 4502.98]  big way then you have to buy a computer
[4502.98 --> 4505.84]  instead of Amazon Luna which is very
[4505.84 --> 4508.82]  popular I heard actually I mean you know
[4508.82 --> 4511.34]  what no I would love to know are anyone
[4511.34 --> 4516.54]  using Luna do you like Luna like are these
[4516.54 --> 4518.98]  servers just empty and therefore the
[4518.98 --> 4521.16]  quality of service is super high it's
[4522.18 --> 4524.14]  possible oh they can feed everybody like
[4524.14 --> 4526.42]  200 megabit a second because nobody's
[4526.42 --> 4528.28]  using it yeah exactly right servers
[4528.28 --> 4530.60]  being empty can I make an appeal really
[4530.60 --> 4534.64]  quick to the developers of Battlebit oh
[4534.64 --> 4538.78]  please you gotta change the map selection
[4538.78 --> 4542.64]  thing it's so bad it's so bad I am
[4542.64 --> 4544.26]  determined this is why players are
[4544.26 --> 4548.46]  leaving this one feature the map ends
[4548.46 --> 4552.54]  you vote for a mode and then you vote for a
[4552.54 --> 4556.70]  map but for some reason it just doesn't
[4556.70 --> 4559.26]  care what anyone votes for anymore and
[4559.26 --> 4561.06]  you can't necessarily pick for the game
[4561.06 --> 4564.16]  mode that you want so certain people only
[4564.16 --> 4566.14]  want to play a particular type of game mode I
[4566.14 --> 4568.44]  personally like conquest because it's more
[4568.44 --> 4571.00]  of the old-school battlefield style we have
[4571.00 --> 4572.94]  all the different vehicles all the different
[4572.94 --> 4575.46]  things are in the game it's more fun in my
[4575.46 --> 4578.80]  opinion for me but I can't vote on it twice
[4578.80 --> 4580.50]  in a row because they hide it for some
[4580.50 --> 4582.70]  reason if you just played it and then even
[4582.70 --> 4584.98]  if you even if the the whole lobby is
[4584.98 --> 4586.06]  like you know what we want to play this
[4586.06 --> 4587.78]  specific map or this specific game mode
[4587.78 --> 4590.90]  it'll just be like well I don't care and
[4590.90 --> 4593.14]  just randomly select something else and
[4593.14 --> 4595.42]  they've had a huge player drop and they
[4595.42 --> 4596.90]  release like a new map and some other
[4596.90 --> 4598.48]  stuff to try to offset it I don't think
[4598.48 --> 4600.06]  that's going to change anything because
[4600.06 --> 4603.26]  people can't play what they want to play
[4603.26 --> 4605.34]  this is exactly the same problem that I had
[4605.34 --> 4608.20]  with Halo Infinite yeah like you there
[4608.20 --> 4610.02]  wasn't even in Halo Infinite they didn't
[4610.02 --> 4611.70]  even pretend that there was a way for you
[4611.70 --> 4613.56]  to say what modes or what maps you wanted
[4613.56 --> 4617.28]  to play yeah you just but now you can pick
[4617.28 --> 4619.02]  modes more easily I don't know I think
[4619.02 --> 4620.46]  it's you're still just stuck in a map
[4620.46 --> 4623.70]  rotation but it was incredibly frustrating
[4623.70 --> 4626.10]  it just feels like gaming has taken some
[4626.10 --> 4628.26]  significant steps back you youngins out
[4628.26 --> 4630.54]  there did you know that you used to be
[4630.54 --> 4632.66]  able to just go into the server browser
[4632.66 --> 4639.50]  sort by 24 7 dust find a server that was
[4639.50 --> 4642.26]  not empty but not full and double click
[4642.26 --> 4644.60]  it and then you would just be playing
[4644.60 --> 4647.12]  play d dust as much as you as long as you
[4647.12 --> 4650.44]  want and then I used to play bad water in
[4650.44 --> 4654.68]  TF2 I would just search 247 24 7 space
[4654.68 --> 4656.30]  bad water gold rush for me but sure
[4656.30 --> 4659.36]  whatever works like the but the so you
[4659.36 --> 4663.20]  know what I suspect is that the playtime
[4663.20 --> 4668.96]  is longer if you force people to play maps
[4668.96 --> 4671.66]  and modes that they don't really care about
[4671.66 --> 4674.00]  and grind them in order to get a bigger
[4674.00 --> 4676.16]  dopamine hit when they actually get the
[4676.16 --> 4678.92]  one they want if I had to guess I would
[4678.92 --> 4681.84]  say that's what's happening in my opinion
[4681.84 --> 4684.80]  to follow that up I think it might be
[4684.80 --> 4687.56]  short-term game long-term loss I think so
[4687.56 --> 4689.60]  too I think you're right I think it's
[4689.60 --> 4691.94]  dreadful to dive into that so maybe yeah
[4691.94 --> 4693.52]  you play for a long time because you're
[4693.52 --> 4695.00]  like I really want to do this one thing
[4695.00 --> 4696.98]  and then you can't do it and you're like I
[4696.98 --> 4698.48]  really want to do that so you stick
[4698.48 --> 4700.46]  around until you can do it but then you
[4700.46 --> 4702.62]  look at the and when the new shiny comes
[4702.62 --> 4704.36]  along I think you're easier to pull away
[4704.36 --> 4706.88]  yeah because you can't just play the game
[4706.88 --> 4709.34]  the way you want to play it yeah it's so
[4709.34 --> 4712.36]  frustrating and like it it kills me man
[4712.36 --> 4716.80]  because there's only I I don't care there's a
[4716.80 --> 4718.46]  particular way that I want to play battle
[4718.46 --> 4720.26]  bit and it's it's gotten to the point
[4720.26 --> 4722.90]  where we spend a very significant amount
[4722.90 --> 4726.70]  of time hunting for the ability to play
[4726.70 --> 4729.10]  the game that we want to play it and it's
[4729.10 --> 4732.68]  just a massive percentage of the time it's
[4732.68 --> 4734.98]  just ripped away because even if the whole
[4734.98 --> 4737.12]  lobby you can watch it happen it'll you'll
[4737.12 --> 4739.22]  you'll play a conquest map yeah and then
[4739.22 --> 4740.78]  this will be a whole group of people that
[4740.78 --> 4743.32]  is like yep we want to play conquest so the
[4743.32 --> 4745.98]  vote thing comes up and if conquest is
[4745.98 --> 4748.90]  available it wins by votes or you'll watch
[4748.90 --> 4751.08]  it happen it won't even be available for
[4751.08 --> 4753.42]  whatever stupid reason so everyone clicks
[4753.42 --> 4755.62]  random hoping to get it and then it just
[4755.62 --> 4756.80]  picks something different and then
[4756.80 --> 4759.42]  everyone leaves you'll see the load into
[4759.42 --> 4761.18]  the next map you'll see it'll be full and
[4761.18 --> 4763.06]  then just everybody's because now
[4763.06 --> 4764.44]  everyone's trying to hunt for the server
[4764.44 --> 4766.20]  that they actually wanted to play on again
[4766.20 --> 4770.82]  yeah it's like man come on I think it's
[4770.82 --> 4772.24]  killing the game and that sucks because
[4772.24 --> 4774.36]  battle but is really fun and I think I
[4774.36 --> 4776.40]  feel like it's gonna die because of this
[4776.40 --> 4780.90]  so I just please save your game and I
[4780.90 --> 4782.40]  think that's the reason why it's dying
[4782.40 --> 4784.50]  I could be wrong I don't know what I'm
[4784.50 --> 4786.32]  talking about ultimately yeah I mean look
[4786.32 --> 4788.16]  at him I mean if he could build a
[4788.16 --> 4789.80]  successful online business then he'd
[4789.80 --> 4790.92]  have more to show for it than this
[4790.92 --> 4796.72]  shirt yeah what color is it Luke tell us
[4796.72 --> 4802.84]  Luke non non official blue non non
[4802.84 --> 4805.48]  recognized convoy 83 put this pretty
[4805.48 --> 4807.88]  well Luna is of so little importance
[4807.88 --> 4809.86]  work can't be bothered to block it at the
[4809.86 --> 4813.10]  firewall and that seems to be the
[4813.10 --> 4818.12]  prevailing sentiment oh my goodness yeah
[4818.12 --> 4819.96]  apparently from the people who have used
[4819.96 --> 4822.58]  it it's Deese and most people have just
[4822.58 --> 4824.26]  never heard of it and it seems to be
[4824.26 --> 4826.60]  kind of a redheaded stepchild at this
[4826.60 --> 4828.36]  point and that no one no one at Amazon
[4828.36 --> 4831.28]  seems to care about it I mean that kind
[4831.28 --> 4832.80]  of checks out given that one of the
[4832.80 --> 4834.12]  highlighted games they have on the
[4834.12 --> 4836.88]  home page is a like rando game from
[4836.88 --> 4842.12]  four years ago do you want to talk about
[4842.12 --> 4843.74]  Google defaulting to pass keys oh we

[4991.80 --> 4993.90]  our sponsor is making this happen oh they
[4993.90 --> 4996.78]  offer high-powered cloud gaming PCs built
[4996.78 --> 4999.84]  on Linux Mint for you to rent and game to
[4999.84 --> 5001.94]  your heart's content they recently
[5001.94 --> 5003.92]  transitioned from a virtual machine based
[5003.92 --> 5006.26]  cloud gaming service to a purely bare
[5006.26 --> 5008.78]  metal solution and by switching to bare
[5008.78 --> 5010.70]  metal you no longer have to worry about the
[5010.70 --> 5012.38]  performance hit that comes with using a
[5012.38 --> 5015.26]  virtual machine the best part maximum
[5015.26 --> 5017.24]  settings doesn't distribute computer
[5017.24 --> 5019.70]  resources to multiple people at once all
[5019.70 --> 5021.74]  the resources of the PC you order will be
[5021.74 --> 5024.68]  dedicated to you they even have computers
[5024.68 --> 5028.82]  running 7900 XT graphics cards for that
[5028.82 --> 5032.42]  sweet sweet 4k gaming the process is
[5032.42 --> 5034.70]  simple just pick the PC you want and
[5034.70 --> 5036.32]  within two to five minutes your cloud
[5036.32 --> 5038.28]  gaming PC will be ready so hop on the
[5038.28 --> 5040.46]  cloud gaming trend today and check out
[5040.46 --> 5042.62]  maximum settings at the link down below
[5042.62 --> 5047.96]  this is going to be hilarious we have
[5047.96 --> 5050.90]  actually worked with a service that had a
[5050.90 --> 5054.44]  similar program in the past and the
[5054.44 --> 5057.20]  second we promoted them they ran out of
[5057.20 --> 5059.36]  machines and were back ordered for months
[5059.36 --> 5062.24]  because there is actually a demand for
[5062.24 --> 5065.42]  this kind of bare metal remote computer
[5065.42 --> 5068.34]  rather than a like a cloud gaming console
[5068.34 --> 5071.34]  because you play games that you own just
[5072.18 --> 5074.48]  on a remote machine that you don't have
[5074.48 --> 5078.58]  to own so it's it's essentially hardware
[5078.58 --> 5081.32]  rental instead of having to buy the
[5081.32 --> 5082.86]  hardware up you might have a sick computer
[5082.86 --> 5084.28]  at home but maybe need something for the
[5084.28 --> 5087.70]  road whatever yeah and maybe your home
[5087.70 --> 5089.38]  internet you know you don't have something
[5089.38 --> 5091.34]  with a decent upload available for example
[5091.34 --> 5093.30]  or something like that because you could
[5093.30 --> 5095.14]  also just stream on your home computer if
[5095.14 --> 5097.90]  you do have a sick computer but yeah maximum
[5097.90 --> 5100.60]  settings um good luck guys
[5100.60 --> 5104.18]  hopefully you've got some stock here
[5104.18 --> 5105.30]  comes the love hug
[5105.30 --> 5111.06]  all right dan hit us sure how about a
[5111.06 --> 5113.60]  how about a softball oh i like softballs

[5164.58 --> 5167.22]  okay no no no uh just old nerve damage
[5167.22 --> 5169.76]  injury oh got it got it got it my
[5169.76 --> 5172.16]  shoulder aggravates it which is kind of
[5172.16 --> 5172.88]  fun
[5172.88 --> 5175.28]  really so your shoulder like it's still it's
[5175.28 --> 5177.62]  a braxial plexus injury the shoulder bones
[5177.62 --> 5180.42]  connected to the face collarbone sort of
[5180.42 --> 5182.42]  thing so the nerves come down the side of
[5182.42 --> 5183.94]  the neck they go underneath the collarbone
[5183.94 --> 5186.58]  and then they go out through the arm so
[5187.22 --> 5190.18]  my collarbone hurts which means that my
[5190.18 --> 5192.82]  hand tingles and some of my face goes
[5192.82 --> 5193.38]  down
[5193.38 --> 5196.74]  wow it's very strange that's wild yeah so
[5196.74 --> 5198.02]  when we're doing stuff we're dealing with
[5198.02 --> 5199.86]  my weird shoulder issues and his weird
[5199.86 --> 5201.94]  shoulder issues and very shoulder issue
[5201.94 --> 5202.74]  prone environment
[5202.74 --> 5205.14]  i used to have a personal changer trainer to
[5205.14 --> 5207.94]  recover from this injury and we focused a
[5207.94 --> 5210.34]  lot on the back stuff and so every time i do
[5210.34 --> 5212.66]  something with a back exercise it's like
[5212.66 --> 5215.06]  300 pounds and then i go to lift my arm
[5215.06 --> 5217.38]  above my head i think i can do like five
[5217.38 --> 5218.34]  pounds
[5218.34 --> 5222.02]  uh properly it's very interesting wow vng

[5278.10 --> 5283.22]  using oh it kind of depends oh i did for a
[5283.22 --> 5288.66]  while and i just find like google authenticators so much
[5288.66 --> 5293.30]  demystified about them more convenient yeah there's a lot of people that
[5294.90 --> 5297.86]  disenchanted i think maybe that's what you're going for what did i say
[5297.86 --> 5301.62]  um i don't remember but it seemed a little off it's probably wrong that's what i meant
[5301.62 --> 5306.66]  um yeah what what did i say i don't remember whatever yeah um
[5306.66 --> 5311.22]  because there's an issue of like if you secure things with it a lot of people
[5311.22 --> 5313.46]  attach them to their keys and then if someone gets your keys
[5313.46 --> 5319.70]  they have your stuff yeah but then i mean there's also cases where that could
[5319.70 --> 5324.34]  make a lot of sense like a physical also factor totally like like people are
[5324.34 --> 5327.94]  saying like hardware keys are much more secure it's like yeah in a lot of cases
[5327.94 --> 5334.74]  they they are they can be but i think their flaws are often overlooked and one of the
[5334.74 --> 5341.94]  problems for me is that if you don't have your hardware key on you there is no way to get into that
[5341.94 --> 5350.02]  account so what users will tend to do is set up alternate authentication for when they don't have
[5350.02 --> 5357.54]  their hardware key on them there's also having multiple factors that are or factors rather than
[5357.54 --> 5362.50]  and factors you might as well not even have it means you might as well not have it and there's also a
[5362.50 --> 5368.26]  ton of services that do not work unless it's set up that way when it comes to hardware keys they're
[5368.26 --> 5374.26]  like oh you can add a hardware key you just also have to have an or and then it's like okay why
[5374.26 --> 5380.42]  did i even bother doing this yeah so i don't know there's a lot of caveats i think they're super cool
[5381.14 --> 5386.10]  i think if you're in a very high security environment where everything can work with
[5387.38 --> 5391.70]  uh no oars it's just ands yeah you just have an outboard motor
[5391.70 --> 5400.10]  if it's just ands then it can be really fantastic but a lot of services in your day-to-day life are
[5400.10 --> 5406.50]  not going to work that way i would even say most and i would also argue that um a huge amount of the
[5406.50 --> 5413.54]  most important ones to you are probably not going to work that way so it's like i don't know um
[5413.54 --> 5421.22]  um yeah they're neat but often not able to be used to the degree that you would actually want
[5421.22 --> 5429.54]  them to be able to be used to like man i'd be super i'd be super down in theory for a hardware key
[5429.54 --> 5434.74]  that's like nuclear launch you know like like this hardware key and this hardware key like if it was
[5434.74 --> 5440.26]  configurable to that degree and like luke and i could each wear necklaces with like a hardware yubi
[5440.26 --> 5447.06]  key on them like okay we need to we need to hack the float plane mainframe to update the server cloud
[5447.62 --> 5453.70]  again we you know both plug them into like both sides of a laptop and we're like yeah yeah yeah
[5454.90 --> 5457.54]  you know whatever right like that we got into the gibson
[5459.94 --> 5465.38]  uh yeah like that would be sick but a lot of that stuff never really a lot of the early promises of
[5465.38 --> 5470.98]  hardware keys never really caught on in my opinion um
[5473.78 --> 5480.82]  yeah all right okay last one i got for you today really the last one today for this segment
[5482.34 --> 5489.54]  you mentioned the need for android or ios having done the linux challenge what changes on linux phone
[5489.54 --> 5495.46]  operating systems would you need to see before trying something like graphene os or proton phone
[5495.46 --> 5501.54]  os i have no idea a lot of people have been telling me to try graphene os when i get my new pixel
[5501.54 --> 5506.34]  there's a couple yeah comments about that yeah wait is gra because i thought android is linux to a
[5507.30 --> 5514.58]  degree yeah at least it used to be i don't know if it's so what do they mean by linux operating systems
[5514.58 --> 5519.94]  like graphene os because graphene os is just like a fork of android if i understand that correctly
[5519.94 --> 5527.86]  right yeah which is also linux and open source so they just mean a different android sort of but also
[5527.86 --> 5533.22]  android is linux so a different linux or something like it's i don't know it's a it seems like sort of
[5533.22 --> 5540.10]  a weird distinction to draw um i'm interested in graphene os but if it doesn't have a call screening
[5540.10 --> 5547.38]  option i will not use it i will not use any phone os that does not have call screening options um for
[5547.38 --> 5552.58]  like the rest of my life as long as we still call each other using phone numbers and there is at least
[5552.58 --> 5560.10]  one option that has call screening if android got rid of call screening and ios had call screening which
[5560.10 --> 5563.30]  i believe it does currently have i would immediately switch to ios
[5563.30 --> 5568.82]  that's how important that is to me got it
[5571.22 --> 5577.62]  maybe there's like a third party thing you could add or something like that uh gm shippo says it does
[5579.22 --> 5585.06]  nice then i might try it so that's something yeah i don't see they don't have compatibility listed for
[5586.74 --> 5592.58]  eighth generation pixels yet but that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't support it soon
[5592.58 --> 5598.74]  it seems like it's got a pretty active community around it a lot of passionate people and i don't
[5598.74 --> 5605.46]  think pixel 8 and pixel 8 pros are in people's hands yet i'm actually i'm honestly not sure i know that
[5605.46 --> 5609.70]  the embargo is up for reviews but i don't know when they start shipping to individual users when did you
[5609.70 --> 5617.62]  order yours uh last week oh okay i'll be getting it this thursday oh wow okay so you're like right in
[5617.62 --> 5622.42]  the in the launch window here yeah did you get the pro or the non-book you got the pro right i did
[5622.42 --> 5626.26]  that came with the watch i knew you were gonna get the pro i actually wasn't going to get the pro
[5626.26 --> 5630.58]  nah you were gonna get the pro i was i knew it i literally had a saved cart that was not the pro and
[5630.58 --> 5640.10]  i knew that that cart would never get checked out why it's just not the right one for you okay you
[5640.10 --> 5644.26]  just need a bigger screen you want to know that you want to know the real answer which i don't know if
[5644.26 --> 5649.22]  it's gonna make them like me more or less but you probably know what it is uh because it comes with
[5649.22 --> 5653.30]  the watch so you can sell it no oh okay hold on hold on so i'm pretty sure the cheaper one came with
[5653.30 --> 5657.46]  the watch too let me think let me think let me think what's the real okay the real reason
[5658.90 --> 5666.02]  it's kind of lame it's like actually kind of lame does it come in a slightly different color no uh
[5668.74 --> 5673.06]  i'm racking my brain here too yeah i'm having a i mean it's not something
[5673.06 --> 5678.26]  it's not something stupid like the stupid wider refreshment no no no no no no no no no no no no
[5678.26 --> 5682.34]  it's not gonna yeah that's dumb i even read that on the spec sheet and was like what well no it's a
[5682.34 --> 5689.86]  power saving thing oh sure yeah no i mean why do you refresh rate i mean sure um hey it's a lot of
[5689.86 --> 5698.18]  work to refresh a screen at one hertz for real though like no because because like decaying and whatnot
[5698.18 --> 5703.22]  yeah it's a whole it's a whole thing uh you know what i don't know actually i i just thought it would
[5703.22 --> 5708.10]  be down to bigger screen it has more ram i know you're gonna use it like for flipping ever um until
[5708.10 --> 5715.54]  it dies so by the way the call screening thing i don't know if that's right uh by call screening what
[5715.54 --> 5721.46]  i specifically mean is not its ability to say like this is a suspicious caller it's when someone calls me
[5721.46 --> 5726.02]  i want to be able to press a button and have my phone talk to them and tell the person that i'm
[5726.02 --> 5731.70]  screening the call and then when they respond i want what they say to turn into text on my screen
[5731.70 --> 5736.90]  and then i can decide to answer the phone or not that is specifically the feature so that's why you
[5736.90 --> 5743.22]  never pick up what i don't screen your calls i know i'm just kidding okay i screened riley once did i
[5743.22 --> 5748.26]  tell you what that no i it was from a phone number i didn't recognize oh okay so i screened it and then he
[5748.26 --> 5755.94]  was like um and i answered it because he said it was riley and i was like okay cool but i get i get
[5755.94 --> 5759.54]  spam calls like once a day yeah he doesn't scream my calls he doesn't have to because i'm in his
[5759.54 --> 5767.14]  phone book so he can just ignore my calls yeah yeah he used to be no it's not like that anymore
[5767.14 --> 5771.46]  but he used to be really bad about picking up my calls i don't know what it was maybe living in a
[5771.46 --> 5776.02]  basement and also just not picking up my calls reception issues was actually a problem for a
[5776.02 --> 5781.54]  while um it's funny how there's always something that's a problem and have the stuff on that i don't
[5781.54 --> 5788.66]  know if that's 100 true i don't know if that's 100 true because that call screening is not available
[5788.66 --> 5798.18]  on all android phones it's only available on pixels i do not know i could be wrong i'll look more into
[5798.18 --> 5803.86]  it later but i just it's not it's not just the warning it's specifically the screen this call
[5803.86 --> 5810.26]  button that i want anyways uh yeah i was a hundred percent gonna buy the cheaper one yep and then i knew it
[5810.26 --> 5821.94]  all right hit me i did it because you convinced me on wanshow nice yes which is why i knew it if i
[5821.94 --> 5827.54]  didn't ask on wanshow i would have just bought the cheaper one and honestly probably been fine with it
[5827.54 --> 5832.58]  yeah no yeah yeah you'll like it better but i think that because i i didn't have much trust in the
[5832.58 --> 5840.90]  longevity of the device that's fair i mean and i said honestly kind of a pixel guy yeah i i think
[5840.90 --> 5846.90]  buying the pro is honestly a bit of a gamble gambling that it will last longer than i honestly expect it
[5846.90 --> 5855.46]  might yeah because it has the same soc but it's driving a higher resolution display so will you feel the
[5855.46 --> 5864.50]  leg more as it ages maybe maybe not but maybe uh but i but the counter argument there yes which i don't
[5864.50 --> 5868.98]  know if you're even saying but i was kind of interpreting is like what do i do on my phone nothing
[5869.70 --> 5881.94]  i i used messaging apps email uh phone call i play chess or or avoid phone call both of those yeah
[5881.94 --> 5887.30]  avoid phone calls apparently like my most important feature on the entire phone i believe you
[5889.94 --> 5896.34]  um and like very very rarely the only higher level gaming i'll do other than chess is i might play
[5896.34 --> 5903.78]  slay the spire like once a month on my phone right yeah i used to be a big like can gamer yeah i'm not
[5903.78 --> 5909.38]  even well i i am still now i guess but it's chess which is like not a problem i just i just anything
[5909.38 --> 5914.50]  i'm all about the google news feed for for my can needs now like i just but like you don't need a
[5915.46 --> 5920.98]  fast phone for that is it that the games just got too involved maybe that's part of it like i can't
[5920.98 --> 5927.78]  just jump into again like i i okay at risk of you know tmi here i don't take 20 minutes to you know
[5927.78 --> 5934.02]  drop off the kids at the pool right so it's relatively efficient yeah so i uh i don't i don't have time to
[5934.02 --> 5941.22]  like click through 18 different you know boxes that i opened today and then queue for a match and
[5941.22 --> 5948.98]  like sit and you know so it's yeah maybe there are still really casual mobile games that that could
[5948.98 --> 5953.46]  be good for can time but i'm all about the news now maybe i just got old there's a couple like there's a
[5953.46 --> 5958.02]  final fantasy game that i was all excited about that i got and played like twice and then i was just
[5958.02 --> 5964.02]  like oh because i never have yeah the the play sessions are too short kotor exactly the same
[5964.02 --> 5967.94]  play sessions are way too short which final fantasy game i don't know like a pixel remake or something
[5967.94 --> 5974.90]  or you mentioned it so i picked it up really the um i don't remember what it was oh man i could find it
[5974.90 --> 5987.54]  but yeah no no yeah what's it called let me see uh man there's a lot of final fantasy games for
[5988.02 --> 5993.46]  mobile i installed warcraft rumble played it once was like wow this is a cash grab and
[5993.46 --> 5999.06]  immediately uninstalled it it was free though so i don't feel that bad um
[6001.14 --> 6005.78]  final fantasy dimensions yeah i've i've been meaning to play that i i haven't even played it yet
[6005.78 --> 6013.62]  so it seems cool it's just yeah you know not toilet compatible yeah yeah like maybe if you're on a trip
[6013.62 --> 6018.02]  or something but then i feel like you're gonna bust out the you can bring your switch yeah yeah
[6019.22 --> 6022.10]  well my intention is to play it on an android tv device
[6023.38 --> 6027.22]  that's what i was planning to do i i was gonna play it on the shield that'd be cool yeah there's no way
[6027.22 --> 6032.18]  i would play it on my phone because it's just the the touch interface is just so clunky why are we doing
[6032.18 --> 6037.62]  this by choice yeah i'm i'm not worried about the purchase i actually do think i'll get my my time out of
[6037.62 --> 6043.38]  it but i think it'll be those like i am unexpectedly stuck here for like an hour yeah i have nothing to
[6043.38 --> 6048.50]  do and i'll be like oh yeah i have that final fantasy game on my phone sweet yeah so like i i think i'll
[6048.50 --> 6055.22]  get play out of it um you do need to play six at some point it is actually my favorite game i'll tell
[6055.22 --> 6059.94]  you what i'll make you a deal i know what the deal is going to be if you play final fantasy
[6059.94 --> 6066.26]  you have to do it first okay can you just at least hear out the deal first if you play final
[6066.26 --> 6074.50]  fantasy 6 i will watch pirates of silicon valley okay hackers okay and i'll play the titanfall 2
[6074.50 --> 6080.90]  campaign i'll do all three of those things he's been he's been writing me about all three of these
[6080.90 --> 6087.54]  things for actual literal years to the point now where there's no way any of them can live up to
[6087.54 --> 6092.58]  any height no no it's impossible he's gonna be disappointed with every one of these things
[6092.58 --> 6095.06]  before you die or your life is not complete
[6098.66 --> 6101.22]  okay i mean i'm down sure all right okay
[6107.38 --> 6114.34]  okay so what i'm part of this now i can't stop what happens too friendly yeah what happens if i play it
[6114.34 --> 6121.62]  and then you don't no no no there'll be milestones i'll tell you milestones after which i have to do
[6121.62 --> 6128.42]  a thing okay deal right deal okay all right i i think is there some what's the best way to play it
[6131.46 --> 6137.30]  you just asked a question it's about to start a war in the comments section
[6137.30 --> 6146.82]  what i mean as someone as someone who you know grew up on it um hold on
[6149.94 --> 6155.14]  let me just see if i can make sure i get this right yeah as as someone who grew up with it i would say
[6155.14 --> 6162.58]  the ted woolsey translation of the original english version of final fantasy 6 which was called
[6162.58 --> 6172.42]  final fantasy 3 at the time oh my has so much character that it outweighs the inaccuracies and the
[6172.42 --> 6181.70]  quirks however there are much more accurate translations um okay and even and even versions of the game with
[6181.70 --> 6188.82]  extra content such as final fantasy 6 for the game boy advance um because you got to remember this game has
[6188.82 --> 6194.66]  been released like a billion 10 flipping times like the skyrim of final fantasy it was released for
[6194.66 --> 6200.10]  super nintendo and somehow has never gotten i i don't know i guess the pixel the latest pixel remaster is
[6200.10 --> 6207.30]  maybe the closest to like really you know getting a a real you know layer of polish on it um but okay so
[6207.30 --> 6212.58]  there's the original for the snes it was released for the playstation as part of an anthology it was
[6212.58 --> 6218.66]  released on game boy advance it was released for pc in like kind of a kludgy crappy one it was released
[6218.66 --> 6224.34]  for android the pixel remaster came out for pc that's six off the top of my head and there's probably more
[6227.78 --> 6240.34]  um wow sea line escape on this thin ice no but that look look i think lines iconic lines like son of a
[6240.34 --> 6248.82]  submarine are a submarine have charm okay i enjoy that line even if they were not true to the original
[6248.82 --> 6256.18]  intent of the writers for the game what does that mean it doesn't matter it means whatever you want it to
[6256.18 --> 6264.74]  mean um conrad thinks i should play the pixel remaster that's probably the one to play it's got a lot of
[6264.74 --> 6271.86]  modern quality of life features like um i i played final i played through final fantasy 9 on pc i bought
[6271.86 --> 6278.58]  it again on steam and played through it and it has this feature where you can just turn off battle
[6278.58 --> 6283.70]  difficulty you can just be like no i just want to do 9999 damage with every hit because i'm finding this
[6283.70 --> 6290.18]  dungeon really boring and so it has modern quality of life features however i would
[6290.18 --> 6301.38]  you know what no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna advise you how to play it you play it however
[6301.38 --> 6307.62]  you like to play it it sounds like the worst form of subs versus dubs i've ever seen yeah what is subs
[6307.62 --> 6314.98]  versus dubs no i don't care what this is this is fine you're gonna play the three what way do you think i
[6314.98 --> 6321.14]  should play it i'll play it whatever well no no no i i because i want you to enjoy it so if you get
[6321.14 --> 6326.02]  bored in a frustrating dungeon like the magitek facility or something like that and you're just
[6326.02 --> 6332.10]  like oh i got on the wrong conveyor and it's dragging me okay whatever i'm just gonna blitz
[6332.10 --> 6336.10]  through a couple battles i'm not gonna tell you no that's not the correct way to enjoy the game
[6337.06 --> 6341.86]  oh yeah honestly i wasn't even really paying attention to that feature portion i just meant version of the
[6341.86 --> 6347.38]  game so do you still think pixel remaster well i haven't played the pixel remaster okay i mean i i
[6347.38 --> 6351.54]  would happily just you know drop into it for a little bit and say okay yeah you want to do you
[6351.54 --> 6359.22]  want to verify for me or or should i just try to go i i would say that everything that i've seen
[6359.22 --> 6367.22]  about the pixel remaster has been very very positive it looks like they have done a good job of
[6367.22 --> 6375.30]  updating the artwork while remaining true to the original style lots of modern creature comforts um
[6376.58 --> 6386.26]  and without unnecessary stupid ugly changes uh i i would say that's probably the best way to go but
[6386.26 --> 6397.54]  i don't know if i will ever be able to i don't know if i'll ever be able to immerse myself in any of
[6397.54 --> 6407.06]  the remakes for little reasons like they rename items they rename spells and for me i don't like that
[6407.06 --> 6416.50]  i don't i i i i find they did that i find the old limitations um you know i find them charming i
[6416.50 --> 6421.78]  find the misspellings of you know some of the espers names because it was an eight character limit
[6423.14 --> 6430.26]  quaint it it's sort of it is a relic of its time it's it's it and so if you think it's more legit to
[6430.26 --> 6436.02]  play the well i don't i will do that i don't because i haven't played the pixel remaster right so i don't
[6436.02 --> 6442.90]  why do why am i calling it a remaster remaster so why are you not why are you not calling me on this
[6442.90 --> 6452.34]  i honestly didn't notice what you said remaster uh some of the charm of some of these old games is
[6452.34 --> 6456.98]  struggling and fighting through stuff though no that's true and there's there's ways that you can
[6456.98 --> 6463.30]  kind of overcome it with emulation to a degree uh like one of the things that um i would do when i
[6463.30 --> 6469.30]  played through later not on my super nintendo like on an emulator is just set the emulation speed to
[6469.30 --> 6475.54]  like 20x and then one of the cool things about final fantasy 6 that's a feature that i haven't
[6475.54 --> 6483.78]  i have seen repeated but often see missed is that if you just hold the confirm button
[6483.78 --> 6492.98]  as you are going into a battle it will just auto fight every character will just fight and just
[6493.62 --> 6497.86]  you know kill stuff so if you're over leveled and you're just trying to like make your way to
[6497.86 --> 6504.18]  your dungeon you can just rent man like turn emulation speed up to 20x and it'll just be like
[6504.18 --> 6512.66]  and they'll and so as long as you don't hmm overestimate your leveledness and get annihilated
[6512.66 --> 6516.34]  while you're before you pull your finger off the button then you know there's little things that
[6516.34 --> 6523.06]  you could do like that if you wanted to actually play like an snes rom or i mean i have a cartridge
[6523.06 --> 6528.26]  if you wanted to pull out the super nintendo that you brought to your first job interview i would be
[6528.26 --> 6538.98]  happy to loan you my cartridge um but i it's an older game and being able to save anytime you want
[6538.98 --> 6545.94]  as an adult with a life that would be helpful kind of a big deal it's very likely i would end up playing
[6545.94 --> 6552.66]  it in like small chunks yeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty nice it's pretty nice oh man if pixel
[6552.66 --> 6560.82]  remaster is is totally chill i will probably go that route yeah the warden the warden meteo
[6560.82 --> 6567.54]  greater than meteor 100 it's just a character limit thing i don't even think that was a character
[6567.54 --> 6572.74]  limit thing because i think there were spells that were longer than that and like medio just sounds
[6572.74 --> 6577.46]  like the spell version of media yeah it's so cool i have no issue with that at all and okay there's
[6577.46 --> 6585.54]  things that were janky like it's fire fire two fire three because there weren't enough characters for
[6587.14 --> 6593.78]  fire uh fireaga right which is what all those are called now and you know lightning was just bolt
[6594.58 --> 6603.62]  bolt two bolt three that doesn't bother me at all ice two ice three um holy is called pearl for some
[6603.62 --> 6609.38]  reason so that's interesting there's definitely some confusing things about the wool sea translation
[6611.38 --> 6618.18]  and so you'll have uh you'll have opponents that are weak against holy and as a kid as far as i could
[6618.18 --> 6626.58]  tell there was absolutely no way to hit them for their weakness so there were problems there were problems
[6626.58 --> 6633.62]  um let's see i've got something for you here mark has sent me a message he's just got an email from
[6634.26 --> 6638.66]  23 and me it's because they took out any religious stuff
[6641.46 --> 6645.86]  but then they didn't take out the weaknesses against holy it just couldn't be a spell name
[6645.86 --> 6652.10]  apparently so it must have just been one of those incomplete like sony america sanitization so
[6652.10 --> 6656.18]  i know that there's some things in final fantasy 6 that were changed for the north american release
[6656.18 --> 6662.82]  like the dancers were less provocative in their you know pixel art way yeah for example and i think
[6662.82 --> 6668.50]  there's an incident of like pixels less like like drinking that is turned into like soda or something
[6668.50 --> 6672.42]  when it was actually alcohol or something like that anyway sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry go ahead dan
[6673.30 --> 6677.86]  oh yeah sorry i didn't mean to interrupt mark has just sent me a message saying he got an email from 23 and
[6677.86 --> 6687.70]  me about his data should i send that over to you guys to have a look at sure okay i'll let you know okay
[6690.98 --> 6699.22]  you know which address to send it to right i'll make sure he knows oh oh oh oh all right sure yep thank you
[6700.42 --> 6706.18]  cool uh are we supposed to do topics now what on earth are we talking about you're talking uh about
[6706.18 --> 6713.22]  topics for another 45 minutes oh cool uh do you want to talk about intel's new graphics card that
[6713.22 --> 6719.78]  everyone is talking about and really excited about yeah well that's too bad because there isn't one oh
[6719.78 --> 6725.38]  i mean there's a graphics card uh but nobody's talking about it when nobody's excited so this is is this
[6725.38 --> 6732.10]  yeah what is this is this arc 3 or no this is arc alchemist this is still first generation arc
[6732.10 --> 6746.74]  but this new card the a580 ah sits in between the a750 and the a380 okay it has 24 xe cores 24 ray tracing
[6746.74 --> 6754.58]  units and um matches the a750 with 512 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth and 8 gigs of ram
[6754.58 --> 6761.62]  uh the release was made with very little fanfare and its pricing at 180 dollars puts it only 20 bucks
[6761.62 --> 6774.90]  below some models of the a750 it is not very exciting why not why is it not exciting just why
[6774.90 --> 6781.70]  i don't know i i would i would i would hazard a guess that this has something to do with
[6782.50 --> 6787.22]  i mean it was okay all of this is speculation this is all speculation because remember how it
[6787.22 --> 6794.50]  was rumored that intel was basically sitting on like warehouses of gpus that they couldn't sell yet
[6794.50 --> 6799.62]  because the drivers weren't done and like there's been a lot of bumps in the road this was announced a
[6799.62 --> 6807.22]  year ago this gpu alongside arc 3 and arc 7 and it just hasn't materialized all this time so if i had
[6807.22 --> 6814.66]  to guess why they're launching this thing i would say it's because they just had them already and they
[6814.66 --> 6819.94]  have to do something with them at some point and so i think this is just their way of putting them out
[6819.94 --> 6826.66]  there recouping some of their losses i mean we already knew looking at the size of the a770s die
[6826.66 --> 6837.86]  and the the price of that card compared to other similar die sized similar vram configured gpus from
[6837.86 --> 6844.90]  amine nvidia that intel is not making money on these things and this is about getting a generation out
[6844.90 --> 6850.98]  there getting their driver development going putting some silicon in gamers hands incentivizing
[6850.98 --> 6857.94]  developers to optimize for arc which clearly worked really well with bethesda and just
[6859.06 --> 6865.06]  understanding that this ain't going to be perfect and we're very grateful to our first generation
[6865.06 --> 6870.42]  customers hey don't worry battle needs will be better we hope and um
[6872.90 --> 6878.90]  okay i mean maybe this is about maybe this is about telling shareholders we've launched the whole lineup now
[6878.90 --> 6887.46]  like i i i can't you know get rid of dead stock um hit a milestone you know whatever whatever the
[6887.46 --> 6893.70]  reason is um it can't be we think this is a really competitive product at a great price and we think
[6893.70 --> 6897.38]  it's going to sell like hotcakes that that much is very clear it's not like intel doesn't know how to
[6897.38 --> 6903.62]  benchmark a gpu i'm sure they can figure that out yeah i mean at least it won't get you banned from
[6903.62 --> 6911.14]  counter-strike 2 hey and it can play starfield now in other news oh yeah yeah there's there's the note
[6911.14 --> 6917.46]  starfield running 117 faster or something yeah intel updated the drivers for all their arc cards adding
[6917.46 --> 6923.78]  support for the a580 but also claiming significant performance gains while many of the games listed
[6923.78 --> 6932.74]  were older titles intel did claim up to 149 improvement at 1440p high settings and up to
[6932.74 --> 6941.54]  117 faster performance at 1080p with ultra settings for starfield which is pretty exciting i i am really
[6941.54 --> 6949.70]  glad that the rumors ended up being false about intel dropping out and giving up on discrete gpus uh it
[6949.70 --> 6955.78]  seems like they have i mean okay if they've stayed the course for this long there's no way we're not
[6955.78 --> 6962.50]  going to see battle mage and i would be very surprised if battle mage doesn't end up being
[6962.74 --> 6971.54]  somewhat competitive decently solid is all i'm really hoping yeah and and realistically you know
[6971.54 --> 6978.50]  i've talked about this before amd has a money furnace and they have lots of money fuel to throw
[6978.50 --> 6985.38]  in their money furnace even if battle mage isn't amazing even if it's not an industry leader as long
[6985.38 --> 6990.98]  as it's a little bit better than alchemist then at least they can continue to go to the investors and
[6990.98 --> 6999.38]  go hey but yeah the other guy is still ahead but we're making up ground here stick with us till celestial
[7000.02 --> 7006.42]  we got this um and maybe we have a legitimate third player in discrete gpu which would be good not
[7006.42 --> 7013.22]  just for gamers but also for the other industries that are using gpus like how how freaking tired are
[7013.22 --> 7020.50]  we of nvidia not caring at all about gamers because they're so busy shipping every wafer that they can
[7020.50 --> 7029.38]  possibly book with tsmc to the ai machine learning industry for crazy higher profits we need more
[7029.38 --> 7036.02]  competition in that space yeah yeah 100 because all of those high priced gpus i mean that cost will get
[7036.02 --> 7040.26]  passed along to you at some point once the vcs are tired of just throwing money into their money
[7040.26 --> 7056.58]  burning furnaces yeah all right time to uh time to have a look at the 23andme um breach email so this
[7056.58 --> 7063.46]  went to one of our staffers let's uh fire up my laptop here we are following up on an email that we
[7063.46 --> 7067.30]  sent earlier this week regarding our ongoing security investigation we learned certain profile
[7067.30 --> 7071.06]  information which customer creates and chooses to share with their genetic relatives and the dna
[7071.06 --> 7077.14]  relatives feature was accessed from individual accounts without the account user's authorization
[7077.14 --> 7082.10]  so you decided who you wanted to share it with and it was accessed by someone else while the
[7082.10 --> 7085.70]  investigation is ongoing we believe the threat actor was able to access certain accounts and
[7085.70 --> 7089.38]  instances where the usernames and passwords that were used were the same as those used on other
[7089.38 --> 7097.14]  websites that had been previously compromised so um uh on so if you go on a site like haveibeenpwned.com
[7097.14 --> 7103.22]  you can find out if a username password combo has been already breached and make sure that you change
[7103.22 --> 7109.62]  that and don't use it anywhere else and also don't do that use unique passwords on every site and use a
[7109.62 --> 7114.98]  password manager please this doesn't line up for me but we can talk more about that later how does this
[7114.98 --> 7120.66]  impact you we have identified your dna relatives profile as one that was impacted in this incident
[7123.14 --> 7127.30]  specifically there's unauthorized access to one or more accounts that were connected to you through
[7127.30 --> 7134.74]  dna relatives as a result uh in this feature was exposed to the threat actor great so your profile
[7134.74 --> 7138.82]  information was exposed you can see a full list of the types of information that may have been included
[7138.82 --> 7143.78]  in your profile here what are you doing about this we're working with third-party forensic experts
[7143.78 --> 7150.26]  where's the part where there's any kind of actual legal liability for any of this that's what i don't
[7150.26 --> 7163.70]  understand like luke i remember sorry i'm not twitch died oh okay not us that's unfortunate that's fine
[7165.06 --> 7169.14]  um so where is i going with this
[7169.14 --> 7176.50]  no legal ramifications yeah right i remember talking about this when we started the forum
[7177.14 --> 7182.74]  and i basically any time we were collecting any kind of personal information like remember when we
[7182.74 --> 7190.10]  set up the ability for people to support the forum through memberships yeah and i was like yo do we have
[7190.10 --> 7194.34]  any payment information let's make sure we're not storing credit cards and you were like no man don't
[7194.34 --> 7201.30]  worry i got this and i'm like okay because i don't want anything name email that's already
[7202.66 --> 7207.46]  like the maximum amount of information that i need to store about someone if they voluntarily fill out
[7207.46 --> 7212.34]  like their birthday or whatever like that's that's on that's on them but i i don't want to be in a
[7212.34 --> 7219.38]  position where we're holding on to anything like payment information or any anything that could turn into a
[7219.38 --> 7224.02]  real world security threat um and
[7227.22 --> 7234.10]  part of that came from a place of being concerned about legal liability but part of it just came from
[7234.10 --> 7239.62]  understanding with the personal liability breaches happen well not just not liability because liability
[7239.62 --> 7244.42]  is like that's a legal legal term yeah i didn't mean it that way but but just personal responsibility there
[7244.42 --> 7250.82]  we go yeah i don't want to hold on to stuff that when inevitably it gets accessed it's going to be a
[7250.82 --> 7257.62]  big problem for you never wanted to like care that much and so what i am trying to understand is why
[7257.62 --> 7264.02]  something that was intuitive and common sense not just to me i'm not some unique big brain genius to
[7264.02 --> 7271.14]  come up with this luke felt exactly the same way about it and and full transparency a bunch of years back
[7271.14 --> 7275.62]  the forum did have a breach yeah we talked about on a wan show we were super public about it this was a
[7275.62 --> 7282.98]  long time ago and it was like luckily we don't hold anything yeah and and so why is it that something
[7282.98 --> 7290.50]  that's common sense to us is not common sense both to the companies that are collecting and storing this
[7290.50 --> 7296.74]  information and to the lawmakers that keep seeing this in their headlines presumably and don't take any kind
[7296.74 --> 7302.90]  of action because at a certain point you can't just go uh-oh spaghettios
[7305.70 --> 7313.46]  there needs to be actual consequences yeah the the other part that's weird to me is the claim of um
[7314.66 --> 7319.22]  while our investigation is ongoing we believe the threat actor was able to access accounts in instances
[7319.22 --> 7324.26]  where the usernames and passwords that were used on 23andme.com were the same as those used in other
[7324.26 --> 7330.50]  websites i mean that would be true at any time that's not a breach do they mean an admin account
[7331.86 --> 7339.14]  or how does this person have millions of accounts i'm not sure it just and like why is it being reported
[7339.14 --> 7347.46]  the way that it's being reported and like all this other stuff doesn't really work for me personally i feel
[7347.46 --> 7354.10]  like there's more to this than they're admitting probably because they're trying to completely dodge
[7354.10 --> 7362.50]  any form of liability like we're kind of talking about um i don't know it just i don't know it doesn't
[7362.50 --> 7371.14]  seem to work for me i'm very frustrated uh oh man matt stl says shadow had a data breach i'm not a customer
[7371.14 --> 7376.02]  anymore and haven't been for some time but they left my account live and stored financial data as
[7376.02 --> 7383.86]  well stored financial data like we like there needs to be like look i'm not it's not that i want an
[7383.86 --> 7390.02]  honest mistake to result in ins determination of every company that makes an honest mistake
[7390.90 --> 7397.14]  you can't swing the pendulum too far the other way but on the other hand there have to be real
[7397.14 --> 7403.06]  consequences that make companies treat this stuff seriously because it's clear that they're not going
[7403.06 --> 7413.06]  to do it on their own people are saying it was credential stuffing um but did they get the credentials
[7413.06 --> 7422.02]  of a higher level user or was there really just millions of accounts that had the same login and password
[7422.02 --> 7433.86]  that's not a regular user really says not sure if it helps but i got an initial email from 23andme and i
[7433.86 --> 7440.82]  don't have an update like this you might not have one yet but also yeah maybe not every individual
[7440.82 --> 7446.82]  account was accessed then maybe my understanding is just wrong i thought it was like millions of accounts
[7446.82 --> 7456.98]  maybe it's not anywhere near that many apparently shadow got social engineered through discord
[7462.10 --> 7470.26]  one account can have the info for many people shared to it oh that makes a lot more sense why would you be
[7470.26 --> 7480.74]  doing that i thought it was millions of accounts of a specific background i heard a lot about a specific
[7480.74 --> 7485.46]  background as well which is why i thought this but now that we know it could be sharing it could be
[7486.02 --> 7490.50]  one individual person that encouraged a very large community of people to do this
[7491.38 --> 7494.66]  for whatever reason and share the information with that central person
[7494.66 --> 7500.82]  um or that group of central people and be a multitude of them got broken into this is brutal
[7502.42 --> 7511.46]  okay well at any rate yeah that's rough that makes a lot more sense i understand now um but yeah yikes
[7513.06 --> 7522.26]  google returns features following a sonos fumble recap google and sonos have been locked in a patent war
[7522.26 --> 7530.10]  uh for the last few years which in early 2022 resulted in google losing a case regarding controlling
[7530.10 --> 7536.82]  multiple speakers together in a group rather than pay sonos a licensing fee google pushed software turning
[7536.82 --> 7543.86]  off that relevant feature on devices that users had already bought uh i spoke out about this at the time
[7543.86 --> 7551.62]  and my take on this was google you actually may not just remove features from devices that you sold
[7551.62 --> 7559.06]  advertising those features um i am personally very frustrated by this google sonos tiff because it
[7559.06 --> 7566.66]  affects me personally i invested in sonos hardware knowingly because it had excellent integration with
[7566.66 --> 7572.82]  google play music and i described this on a recent when show or other recent video i can't remember when
[7572.82 --> 7579.62]  and some people seemed to kind of misunderstand what i meant i know that you can still use youtube music
[7579.62 --> 7587.46]  with sonos the problem is you have to use sonos's clunky crappy app and honestly even the speaker
[7587.46 --> 7594.26]  grouping is clunkier in sonos's app compared to the extremely elegant integration that was in google
[7594.26 --> 7602.26]  play music so i never touched the sonos app i just would come home and i would be listening to whatever
[7602.26 --> 7607.30]  i'm listening to in my headphones and i would go into google play music and then i would just use the
[7607.30 --> 7613.78]  cast button the normal cast button and i would just click it and then i could click a speaker or i could
[7614.34 --> 7620.10]  click a few speakers and confirm and i don't know if it supported like static groupings i actually can't remember
[7620.10 --> 7627.06]  because i haven't seen the interface in years but it was amazing because it was just continuous and then
[7627.06 --> 7634.82]  when i was on my way out i would actually be able to walk out the door and just flip it back to my headphones
[7634.82 --> 7641.46]  and be good to go it was just continuous music and it was so seamless and it was awesome and then google
[7641.46 --> 7646.98]  deprecated play music and then because of their patent tip with sonos have never integrated that
[7646.98 --> 7656.74]  same functionality into youtube music and it sucks i know that spotify has integration with sonos it is
[7656.74 --> 7665.14]  not as good it is really clunky and inelegant by comparison um gremlin injector asks but why did you
[7665.14 --> 7670.66]  trust sonos don't you know better after their bricking debacle i think sonos learned an important lesson
[7670.66 --> 7674.90]  after the bricking debacle which if you paid close attention to it you'll know never happened
[7675.46 --> 7684.66]  nothing is bricked everything still works which is great um so yeah yeah i'm i mean anything smart can just
[7684.66 --> 7692.58]  disappear which really sucks and is bad but it seems like they actually learned something handyman says
[7692.58 --> 7699.06]  lmao what nothing compares to spotify connect do you know that did you use it okay then i also have a
[7699.06 --> 7707.14]  counter yeah spotify connect does not come with youtube premium yeah but also i i i considered just
[7707.14 --> 7711.86]  switching over to spotify just if it had really good integration and it just didn't i'm sorry it didn't
[7711.86 --> 7719.14]  uh it was not as good it was not as clean it was not as seamless um google play music was really
[7719.86 --> 7724.74]  really awesome with the with the uh with the integration with sonos come on what do you mean
[7724.74 --> 7732.66]  come on i i'm going to subscribe my my thing on spotify is if you watch a lot of youtube i don't think
[7732.66 --> 7737.54]  it's worth it because if you watch a lot of youtube youtube premium is actually fantastic and it comes with
[7737.54 --> 7743.94]  uh youtube music which is a not amazing app but it still gets you basically all of your music you
[7743.94 --> 7750.02]  can listen to without ads it gets you the 80 of spotify maybe it doesn't get you 100 but it gets
[7750.02 --> 7756.58]  you the 80 of spotify and it's not another subscription service you have to get i don't know anyway as
[7756.58 --> 7765.46]  someone who had serious frustration with this situation um i basically went look google this is your product you
[7765.46 --> 7772.02]  sold and the feature no longer works and that that really sucks um i i wish you guys would just pay
[7772.02 --> 7778.42]  the licensing fee however it seems like according to the facts of the case google may have been right
[7778.42 --> 7785.86]  here so last friday a judge decided that some of the patents in the case were invalid and threw out the
[7785.86 --> 7792.34]  decision on the grounds that two of the five patents were actually filed in 2019 and sonos inappropriately
[7792.34 --> 7799.22]  tied them to its 20 2006 applications so that it would appear as though they predated google's
[7799.22 --> 7805.86]  devices google's immediate response to this overruling was to push an update restoring some of the old
[7805.86 --> 7810.98]  features that update was released on tuesday two business days after the decision google likewise
[7810.98 --> 7816.82]  released a blog post calling for patent reform this is not the only recent setback for sonos who
[7816.82 --> 7822.82]  apparently have been trying and failing to address an infamous problem with their 900 sonos arc sound
[7822.82 --> 7829.22]  bars that causes the device to occasionally emit a loud bang described by many users as similar to a
[7829.22 --> 7834.50]  gunshot oh i've never heard this i have an arc um maybe it's maybe it's only certain revisions of the
[7834.50 --> 7839.38]  hardware i don't know that's not great sonos attributes the problem to an interoperability issue with
[7839.38 --> 7845.46]  dolby atmos and has advised users to turn it off and switch to dolby 5.1 complaints about the issue go back at least
[7845.46 --> 7850.10]  two years okay in that case i don't know i have never experienced this with mine but uh who knows
[7850.10 --> 7854.10]  maybe that time i thought that someone was firing a gun in my living room it was actually my arc
[7854.98 --> 7859.86]  no i'm no i'm kidding i'm kidding i've never heard you never know i mean our discussion question here is
[7859.86 --> 7863.94]  a good one when companies remove a substantial feature from a device or a service should they be
[7863.94 --> 7870.02]  obligated to offer a refund i mean i i think that's the least that they can do i i feel like they should
[7870.02 --> 7875.46]  have to do something or like you know what i or okay speaking of patent reform okay you know what
[7875.46 --> 7882.02]  about this what if what if um you know pending the results of the of the litigation uh google pays
[7882.02 --> 7888.26]  the licensing fees into an escrow account that is returned to google with you know interest or
[7888.26 --> 7893.38]  something like that from sonos if they win or goes to sonos if ultimately they lose but at the end of the
[7893.38 --> 7899.30]  day this shouldn't be impacting the customer that is definitely not the right way i agree
[7900.50 --> 7904.82]  i just want google play music back so that i can cast to my speakers properly
[7906.34 --> 7913.30]  sorry it's okay i i i tried i wanted to like oh what is it called uh dts connect or something like
[7913.30 --> 7920.66]  that is that is that what it's called uh i i can't i can't remember what what's what's that what's
[7920.66 --> 7928.58]  that other one called uh svs has a box uh streaming svs prime yeah yeah here it is the svs prime i
[7928.58 --> 7936.34]  really wanted to like this thing on paper it's awesome it seems like stop it seems like a high
[7936.34 --> 7945.38]  quality amp and you know the hardware seems great um it's you know airplay 2 compatible i don't have an
[7945.38 --> 7955.46]  iphone uh but the the way that it worked for me was through i want to say oh dts play fi yeah this is
[7955.46 --> 7969.86]  this is their this is their audio over wi-fi solution and it's behind last time i used it uh i really i i
[7969.86 --> 7977.62]  i'm okay full full disclosure svs would have given me a sick deal to outfit my house with those such
[7977.62 --> 7982.18]  that it would have been i i don't i don't i don't know what exactly they were offering i don't remember
[7982.18 --> 7987.94]  but it definitely i what i know is from talking to uh jake about it it would have been cheaper than the
[7987.94 --> 7995.46]  used last gen sonos boxes i bought oh wow and i would have had brand new uh prime prime wireless pros
[7995.46 --> 8005.94]  um and i just said forget it and i just i just bought them um if i if i had fewer zones i i think
[8005.94 --> 8010.74]  from my experience with it it was like fine but i don't remember the exact details i basically have
[8010.74 --> 8014.50]  a lot of zones yeah i ran into some kind of an issue and i basically went okay forget it i can't really
[8014.50 --> 8018.90]  do this anymore by the way sop canon in flip plane chat says that they're having that pop issue that you
[8018.90 --> 8025.38]  were describing oh really yeah well apparently that is a thing well sop canon maybe should stop
[8025.86 --> 8036.18]  stop firing the cannon stop pop canon yeah horrible yeah i know actually terrible um next topic
[8037.94 --> 8046.10]  yeah best buy nixes physical media meanwhile this is hilarious netflix is planning to open physical
[8046.10 --> 8052.34]  locations wait what i didn't see that part the best buy nixing physical media is interesting when i used to
[8052.34 --> 8059.94]  work at the best of buys back in the day it was like probably a close to a quarter of the store
[8061.06 --> 8067.62]  it was huge got them cds it was massive pick up that sarah mclaughlin yeah and you could tell over
[8067.62 --> 8072.98]  time alanis morissette that section of the store was shrinking and i guess now it's just shrinked to zero
[8074.42 --> 8082.42]  they will no longer sell dvds or blu-ray discs starting in 2024 this is only five years after
[8082.42 --> 8090.82]  they dropped selling music cds according to john fairhurst ceo of limited run games walmart may also
[8090.82 --> 8096.98]  be dropping sales of physical games in the near future and limited run is awesome just a weird little
[8096.98 --> 8100.90]  shout out i i've gotten a few things from them everything i've gotten from them has been very
[8100.90 --> 8107.86]  good quality um very cool group of people doing very cool things we've talked about this a fair bit
[8107.86 --> 8114.90]  um i think more more recently when australia was not going to get physical media or something like
[8114.90 --> 8118.82]  that oh yeah yeah some of the movie studios weren't going to do physical blu-ray releases in australia
[8118.82 --> 8127.14]  um high quality the highest quality version of a movie may simply no longer be available to consumers
[8127.70 --> 8134.50]  very soon like almost now starting in 2024 like you'll still probably be able to buy them online for
[8134.50 --> 8142.58]  quite some time but this is kind of wild um i i don't really have a ton to add here other than that
[8142.58 --> 8148.74]  there are still advantages to physical media and there are still problems with abandoning
[8148.82 --> 8155.78]  physical media um but that doesn't change the fact that this this tide cannot be stopped now
[8155.78 --> 8164.50]  it's very clear um meanwhile netflix has announced that they will be opening two netflix houses and this
[8165.30 --> 8171.70]  please tell me that this is a play on columbia house that they're gonna call it netflix house
[8171.70 --> 8182.02]  please please tell me that um these netflix houses will have merch food and fan experiences experience
[8182.02 --> 8187.86]  location is what they're calling it based on whatever happens to be the hotness on netflix at the time
[8187.86 --> 8193.14]  they have previously dabbled in pop-up retail stores and experimented with immersive experience
[8193.14 --> 8199.70]  based on the hit show squid game can i just say this actually makes a ton of sense to me
[8200.74 --> 8205.62]  i i see there's a bit more skepticism in our discussion prompting here but i thought it was like
[8205.62 --> 8211.46]  go rent a physical cop i was like what are you doing netflix land yeah i mean would would you go to
[8211.46 --> 8216.66]  a stranger things themed you know land inside a netflix theme park
[8216.66 --> 8227.38]  uh i think some people would i mean netflix has a serious collection of first party ip now i feel
[8227.38 --> 8232.18]  like i would go to what's that what's that the the game show one that everyone was freaking out about
[8232.18 --> 8237.06]  the mr beast remade you just said it i think yeah squid game yeah i feel like i'd go to one of those
[8237.06 --> 8242.42]  that'd be yeah like you could totally have squid game experiences so here here we go so squid game
[8242.42 --> 8249.06]  stranger things wednesday i don't know that they would necessarily own enough of adam's family's ip
[8249.06 --> 8256.50]  rights to do anything with that but who knows bridgerton though bridgerton is huge um stranger
[8256.50 --> 8262.74]  things which i already oh no sorry i just i already mentioned that lucifer um yvonne really liked that one
[8262.74 --> 8272.10]  yeah the witcher that's not their ip but if they put some effort into it i definitely see the
[8272.10 --> 8278.02]  opportunity in the long term for them to build out a theme park experience here and i mean disney
[8278.02 --> 8285.38]  has certainly shown the way in terms of integrating theme parks into a successful media business
[8288.58 --> 8296.58]  oh boy yeah people are uh people are talking about the the bridgerton people have some ideas for what
[8296.58 --> 8302.42]  the bridgerton zone might be like okay okay okay this is not an adults only park get your mind out of it
[8303.62 --> 8309.46]  i've never watched bridgerton but i've seen some ideas in chat and okay then yeah bridgerton's pretty uh
[8310.58 --> 8317.86]  pretty sweaty got it yeah yeah yeah in a different form yep uh not like tries really hard at video games
[8317.86 --> 8324.98]  no kind of the opposite yeah no it's busy trying hard at other things um this is interesting a
[8324.98 --> 8331.30]  california court has ruled that facebook's ad targeting system is discriminatory both because
[8331.30 --> 8337.30]  it requires advertisers to choose their ad audience by demographic characteristics like age and gender
[8337.94 --> 8344.74]  and because facebook's look-alike audience tool then matches those businesses with potential customers that
[8344.74 --> 8351.94]  have traits similar to their existing audience this follows a court case where an older woman complained
[8351.94 --> 8358.34]  that she was being excluded from ads that offered favorable deals on life insurance because the ads
[8358.34 --> 8366.58]  were typically targeted at younger people and men isn't this interesting why men this could change
[8366.58 --> 8374.98]  change the landscape of targeted advertising the case did find that her claim was accurate but it's
[8374.98 --> 8379.94]  unclear why life insurance policies would specifically want to appeal to men over women this is a note in our in our
[8379.94 --> 8385.86]  in our yeah yeah yeah yeah now younger people people obviously they're less likely to die in the near future
[8385.86 --> 8393.62]  but men are actually more likely to die yeah younger than women of the same age um yeah so maybe more dudes are like
[8393.62 --> 8399.70]  like i'm pretty risky i should get this yeah yeah i have absolutely no idea men are apparently more
[8399.70 --> 8406.58]  likely to buy them um 58 of american men own life insurance policies versus 47 of american women but there
[8406.58 --> 8410.90]  could be any number of reasons for that that kind of makes sense to me like if it's only marketed to men
[8410.90 --> 8416.66]  then maybe only they buy it i don't know um meta is likely to appeal this decision but if it's upheld
[8416.66 --> 8423.46]  the decision might require every ad-based platform on the internet at least the ones that operate in america
[8423.86 --> 8429.94]  to restructure their ad targeting systems i mean right is is ad targeting just going away this will
[8429.94 --> 8436.98]  really affect flow plane very heavily we'll have to re-engineer yeah the zero zero dollars of
[8436.98 --> 8438.34]  advertising that we do every year
[8440.90 --> 8449.70]  the free advertising that the parent company gives it yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly um
[8449.70 --> 8455.86]  um do you want to talk about the 23 year old coder who fixed a 22 year old firefox bug
[8456.42 --> 8462.10]  um that's awesome sure a 22 year old bug in firefox has finally been fixed by a 23 year old
[8462.10 --> 8467.70]  engineering student who had never contributed to an open source project before the bug causes tooltips
[8467.70 --> 8473.54]  to remain in the foreground of the user command tabs away command tabs uh command tabs away from the
[8473.54 --> 8479.46]  browser before moving their mouse away from the toolbar the tooltip would persist until the user put
[8479.46 --> 8485.78]  firefox in the foreground again and move the mouse off the toolbar wow that sounds like a pretty minor bug
[8485.78 --> 8492.58]  but i am 100 certain that would really really annoy people with specific ocd uh the issue was first
[8492.58 --> 8500.26]  reported in june 20 uh sorry 2002 and in fact the bug uh predates firefox itself and was inherited from
[8500.26 --> 8505.78]  the project it was branched off of the issue was reported repeatedly over the course of two decades
[8505.78 --> 8512.66]  but it was never resolved likely because it was a minor cosmetic issue not causing crashes thus low priority
[8515.22 --> 8522.58]  after being repeatedly annoyed by the bug 23 year old yifan zu which i hope i pronounced correctly but
[8522.58 --> 8527.94]  probably didn't you did a great job horrified to realize how long it had been how long it had gone
[8527.94 --> 8533.30]  unaddressed and decided to fix it despite the uh lack of familiarity with the firefox code base
[8533.30 --> 8538.02]  but otherwise no one else was going to and then they did and it was successful as far as i can tell
[8538.02 --> 8543.22]  that's so cool they did end up needing a little bit of help from a more uh a more experienced developer
[8543.22 --> 8548.18]  but hey that's one of the benefits taking initiative open source let's go right yeah that's great i think
[8548.18 --> 8554.34]  it's super cool yeah what's not cool is the fact that i'm spoiling my children and turning them into
[8554.34 --> 8560.50]  little monsters what the there there was uh there was a post uh earlier this week that was flagged by
[8560.50 --> 8568.82]  our our community uh coordinator uh that reads like this i'm astonished at how much gaming linus gives to
[8568.82 --> 8574.58]  his kids nowadays i know i am nobody to control him but still from their personal setups to the caravan
[8574.58 --> 8580.18]  gaming to server rack mounted gaming and much more from the other video projects isn't linus giving too much
[8580.18 --> 8585.06]  luxury to his children i mean even with me all the dedication that i have converted from the sadness
[8585.06 --> 8589.78]  and anger of not having tech luxury at the most i would only give my children a small game console
[8589.78 --> 8596.02]  in nursery an xbox or ps in first year a light laptop in fourth a mobile in sixth or earlier and a gaming
[8596.02 --> 8606.18]  pc around some time not 10 of the top of the line rtx 4090 gaming pcs at age five um discuss okay so hold on a
[8606.18 --> 8616.58]  second yes it is very clear that my kids enjoy access to technology that is very different from what
[8616.58 --> 8626.82]  normal kids would have they have pretty cool gaming pcs at the ages that they are um but they're pretty
[8626.82 --> 8632.02]  time limited and you you make them do things they have like goals that they have to accomplish before
[8632.02 --> 8637.70]  they can unlock certain amounts of gaming time but don't overestimate how much they are actually
[8637.70 --> 8645.54]  allowed to use them yeah as a tech savvy parent i may have the capability and the means to fill
[8645.54 --> 8651.54]  my house with technology i was i was counting them and i think in my house there's no fewer than
[8651.54 --> 8658.02]  somewhere between 15 and 20 computers i wonder how many screens um fewer than you might think
[8658.02 --> 8664.02]  a lot of them are surprisingly single monitor setups but still tvs okay there's a fair number of
[8664.02 --> 8667.78]  screens yeah there's a fair number of screens because there's some there's a bunch of laptops
[8667.78 --> 8671.62]  but those are redundant right now because the laptops that used to run the land center are just
[8671.62 --> 8676.98]  kind of in a pile right um because we still need to do a video like cleaning it up and so i haven't
[8676.98 --> 8681.86]  cleaned it up on my own time because i want to make a video about it anyway yeah the point is um see
[8681.86 --> 8687.94]  people ask like what's your power bill i mean they're not on all the time right like so yes i have the means and
[8687.94 --> 8696.26]  and the capability to fill my place with computers but that doesn't mean that i but that also means
[8696.26 --> 8703.22]  i have the capability to restrict yeah they don't just have free range to access to the computers um
[8704.42 --> 8710.82]  i i make extensive use of parental controls like google's family link um and microsoft's whatever
[8710.82 --> 8715.46]  family safety i forget what it's called they're not allowed to install apps without permission they're
[8715.46 --> 8721.30]  not allowed to use the computers without permission um they have to trade at a ratio of i think one to
[8721.30 --> 8733.38]  1.5 uh piano practice or um dance or other like uh activity practice or chores in order to get gaming
[8733.38 --> 8739.70]  time um there are exceptions when we do like family gaming time they don't have to do anything for that but
[8740.26 --> 8743.94]  you know that's not that's not something that happens every night that's that's a rule that a lot of
[8743.94 --> 8750.82]  people have like there's i know one of them too is like if there's a type of game like uh an example
[8750.82 --> 8756.02]  we had when we were growing up very often was like shooter games a lot of people didn't want their kids
[8756.02 --> 8763.54]  playing shooter games below a certain age but it was fairly common i would find with like my friends
[8763.54 --> 8769.06]  where they would be like yeah i can't play shooter games by myself but i can play like co-op halo with my
[8769.06 --> 8775.06]  dad because like as long as they're playing together they were like okay this is fine um so yeah i don't
[8775.06 --> 8780.58]  know family time's always been different with that said it's a valid concern and it's one we think about
[8780.58 --> 8789.62]  a lot um thank you for raising it and it's it's definitely something that we're we're we're cognizant of
[8789.62 --> 8795.46]  and um you know it's tough right because on the one hand yeah we don't we don't want them to be
[8795.46 --> 8800.10]  spoiled little brats right like that side i don't think that's anything i don't think that's
[8800.10 --> 8805.54]  something anyone wants from their kids i think it's something that happens by accident i'm sure
[8805.54 --> 8811.78]  there's someone at least yeah i was going to say 90 of the time i would say that spoiled awful kids
[8811.78 --> 8817.46]  probably happen by accident but that doesn't mean that you can be complacent about it that means that
[8817.46 --> 8826.26]  if anything you need to be more vigilant about it so don't worry we are we are on it we are doing our
[8826.26 --> 8833.86]  best um and no don't assume that just because they have a lot of options for devices that they can use
[8833.86 --> 8838.66]  that that necessarily means that they can just go on them whenever they want uh there are some exceptions
[8838.66 --> 8843.62]  i actually created a document a couple of weeks ago i'm pretty proud of this little bit of parenting
[8843.62 --> 8853.38]  uh the document is called i'm bored and the reason it exists is because i wanted to have
[8853.38 --> 8859.30]  something to point my kids to every single time they walk up to me and say that's smart
[8860.02 --> 8867.86]  i'm bored and so this is this is the i'm bored document do you want me to read yeah sure you can you can
[8867.86 --> 8875.38]  read it okay so he's got locations so i am asked i'm bored and i am at location x these are the
[8875.38 --> 8881.62]  things that i can say so everywhere includes hide and seek tag listen to music or dance educational
[8881.62 --> 8889.38]  activities on phone or computer uh camera play take pictures to record videos of each other do whatever
[8889.38 --> 8894.98]  film little videos do whatever forts building tents out of tubes or crazy forts other things i used to
[8894.98 --> 8901.86]  build them out of uh the dining room chairs when i was a kid um reading comic book corner swing outside
[8901.86 --> 8908.66]  on the porch bedroom cats just play with the cats in general okay we're upstairs here's this insanely
[8908.66 --> 8913.86]  long list of toys all right we're on the main floor arts and crafts hang out with different people play
[8913.86 --> 8919.62]  piano yoga and exercise okay we're in the basement all these other things oh my god this is really long
[8919.62 --> 8926.50]  there is so much to do in our house it's very long it takes multiple scrolling swipes to get through it and for that
[8926.50 --> 8933.54]  reason i don't want them playing video games all the time because they could play dress up or they could
[8933.54 --> 8940.26]  have a tea party or they could practice magic tricks um there are some video games that don't need permission
[8940.26 --> 8946.66]  if they play beat saber uh or make sense dance dash or box vr all of those makes or anything that is like a
[8946.66 --> 8953.06]  high exertion video game that's allowed they're allowed to play ring fit adventure without permission
[8953.06 --> 8958.02]  that also makes sense as long as they have it set to a reasonable difficulty so they're not just
[8958.02 --> 8965.22]  breezing through it um yeah other than that they're allowed to play games that we consider educational so
[8965.22 --> 8971.38]  i would say for my youngest for example something like wordscapes is considered educational i would say that
[8971.38 --> 8977.54]  gets a little less educational later on um but you know if they up to a certain age yeah if they're
[8977.54 --> 8983.62]  using duolingo or something like that i would i would consider that to be educational so uh using family
[8983.62 --> 8991.22]  link you can apply different limits to apps um on a per day basis or you can okay you can apply limits
[8991.22 --> 8997.54]  system-wide or to specific apps so you could have 45 minutes of total screen time in a day but an unlimited
[8997.54 --> 9002.50]  amount of this during that time and only five minutes of this during that time and a completely
[9002.50 --> 9008.90]  unlimited amount of a kindle for example is an app that is completely unlocked on the kids that have
[9008.90 --> 9015.94]  phones as phones and other devices we also have a kindle that they can just use um because i i'm i'm of
[9015.94 --> 9023.30]  the mind that i don't care what they read as long as they read um you know make of that what you will
[9023.30 --> 9029.06]  it means that every time i go on my kindle unlimited account i can't find anything in the sea of stupid
[9029.86 --> 9033.62]  minecraft books or whatever but that's a small price to pay
[9037.30 --> 9045.38]  oh my goodness um are we doing yeah topics still okay i'll just blow through this one i genuinely
[9045.38 --> 9049.94]  think this will be short but it was in the callout topic so it is what it is github copilot might be
[9049.94 --> 9054.74]  running at a loss according to a report from the wall street journal github copilot which cost users
[9054.74 --> 9061.54]  ten dollars a month was losing microsoft over twenty dollars per month per user in the first few months
[9061.54 --> 9068.02]  of this year with some heavy users costing microsoft up to eighty dollars a month microsoft has not
[9068.02 --> 9073.54]  responded to the claim that github was running at a loss but nat friedman who was ceo of github when
[9073.54 --> 9081.22]  uh copilot was launched in october of 2021 claimed that uh called the claim false however friedman left
[9081.22 --> 9087.46]  the company in november of 2021 and has not provided any additional details with the wall street journal
[9087.46 --> 9092.50]  standing behind their original reporting at the beginning of this year chat gpt was estimated to
[9092.50 --> 9099.54]  cost openai seven hundred thousand dollars a day to run at 36 cents a query now here can i just jump in
[9099.54 --> 9108.10]  for a second how does that account for the hardware because openai would probably roll their own
[9108.10 --> 9114.74]  hardware so is that just in power i'm honestly not sure or is that with amortized hardware cost across
[9114.74 --> 9122.18]  it too i'm assuming that but i'm not sure anyway uh yeah it's well known that most llms are resource
[9122.18 --> 9128.58]  hogs analysts have projected projected that unless these ai systems become much cheaper and more efficient we
[9128.58 --> 9134.90]  might see a significant dampening in investor euphoria over ai due to the heavy costs associated
[9134.90 --> 9141.94]  with deployment and uncertainty around profit models yeah yeah so this is what we talked about
[9141.94 --> 9147.94]  yesterday um and whether or not the github copilot thing is necessarily true something that i still
[9147.94 --> 9157.38]  stand behind is the access to bing chat and now windows copilot being completely free is wild that's
[9157.38 --> 9162.74]  mind-blowing to me oh by the way apparently um open ai is using azure that makes sense right because of
[9162.74 --> 9174.34]  the microsoft microsoft assessment yeah okay yeah so the chat's going on ai crashing yeah not yet it
[9174.34 --> 9181.70]  takes a bit more time for the silicon valley investor bros to uh chill out this is part of the reason though
[9181.70 --> 9188.34]  um why innovation has been what i would personally call stifled to a certain degree is because access
[9188.34 --> 9197.94]  to this type of hardware has become so financially competitive that a lot of uh not vc backed interested
[9197.94 --> 9203.22]  parties are having extremely hard times breaking into the space they can't get the hardware power
[9203.70 --> 9210.66]  uh to be able to back it up there's even like ovh emailed me this week and was like by the way we got gpu
[9210.66 --> 9217.30]  servers now heard you do video you want some gpu servers and i was like no because i know what the
[9217.30 --> 9222.26]  pricing is going to be on them yeah um if this was a few years ago i might have been like maybe we'll
[9222.26 --> 9229.94]  take one to experiment with but now it's like no these are effectively ai servers or ai research servers
[9229.94 --> 9238.90]  whatever you want to call it um so yeah not interested um twitch chat asked what the heck are you eating
[9238.90 --> 9250.42]  doritos gamer fuel yeah speaking of which we still owe you guys a gpu server don't we yeah okay
[9252.90 --> 9257.06]  i'll i'll personally build it not that worried about it okay but you could do something with it
[9257.78 --> 9263.38]  uh we could play around with it would it be cool it could be i don't know if we would actually hit
[9263.38 --> 9270.82]  production though would it transcode the wanshow vod faster yeah i don't want to have to spend
[9270.82 --> 9278.02]  saturday's dealing with this anymore but like well there was two unique issues in a row i don't think
[9278.02 --> 9283.30]  you'll be spending this saturday dealing with it um bet did you just say bet
[9283.30 --> 9292.02]  no i think it'll be fine yeah it seemed it seemed to be quite you know did you just unironically say
[9292.02 --> 9298.74]  bet no i i said it ironically okay like definitely all right cool definitely i was like who are you
[9300.10 --> 9304.82]  if you thought that i had said that unironically we would have a problem and we would actually have
[9304.82 --> 9310.10]  to have a serious conversation this is great i just get to sit on the sidelines while things get spicy here
[9310.10 --> 9314.58]  sorry is that like a rude thing to say or something or like yeah no it's just not
[9316.02 --> 9320.02]  he would just never say it oh yeah yeah i love doing that i love doing that
[9323.46 --> 9332.66]  oh i'm sorry if like your dad unironically said yeet like it would just be like what you know what i mean
[9332.66 --> 9339.86]  like it's i don't know uh um anyways you just attacked my gen z self no
[9339.86 --> 9344.98]  i did the problem is that he's not gen z that's that's why i was so confused yeah but i'm i mean
[9344.98 --> 9350.50]  i'm terminally online but i i use it all like absolutely ironically yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's
[9350.50 --> 9356.90]  how it starts i know it's actually become a problem it's a real problem i start saying things and then
[9357.86 --> 9363.94]  it just i can't stop yeah and i try i've noticed that and if i find a new thing that i'm like haha this
[9363.94 --> 9370.42]  is funny to say yeah i will avoid it otherwise it'll become part of my lexicon vernacular lexicon
[9370.42 --> 9375.06]  no i think you're right which is it aren't they both right probably
[9375.06 --> 9385.70]  i don't know what i'm doing now i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna do it i'm not gonna do it
[9385.70 --> 9386.66]  as you know i'm not gonna do it already
[9386.66 --> 9392.02]  told you he's got me into it now it's kind of great it's kind of great it's wholesome i like uh
[9392.58 --> 9397.30]  what is it what is it called meta modern where we've moved past like the everything is cringe and
[9397.30 --> 9401.86]  being sincere is gross and now everything is just like yeah i like this thing and everybody's like
[9401.86 --> 9403.02]  Yeah! Awesome!
[9403.64 --> 9406.88]  It's so rare to find positivity in the world that it's like, wait a second.
[9407.04 --> 9409.58]  That's the new era. It's like post-cringe.
[9409.84 --> 9411.32]  You know, it's just being wholesome.
[9411.32 --> 9414.34]  I'm so down with that because we talked about this earlier in the show.
[9414.40 --> 9415.98]  Everything being black, white, and gray, right?
[9416.40 --> 9416.60]  Yeah.
[9416.62 --> 9419.78]  It's the same kind of thing. It's like, no, you can't stand out and be interesting.
[9419.92 --> 9420.96]  It's like, oh, come on.
[9421.14 --> 9424.74]  Speaking of black, white, and gray, Travero.
[9425.26 --> 9426.92]  We should probably switch to Floatplane After Dark.
[9428.82 --> 9429.78]  Wancho After Dark.
[9430.06 --> 9431.56]  Sorry, Twitch, I gotta cut you off.
[9431.86 --> 9433.16]  Yeah, bye, YouTube.
[9433.38 --> 9435.86]  I think Floatplane After Dark would be significantly different content.
[9436.08 --> 9436.30]  Yeah.
[9437.30 --> 9437.78]  Ooh.
[9438.40 --> 9439.90]  I mean, we can upload anything there.
[9441.26 --> 9442.84]  Travero in Floatplane Chat asks,
[9443.04 --> 9445.04]  What did you think of the Bill Watterson book?
[9446.56 --> 9451.12]  I have only cracked open the first couple of pages.
[9451.46 --> 9452.44]  What Bill Watterson book?
[9452.54 --> 9453.36]  Bill Watterson.
[9453.94 --> 9455.42]  He released a book. I pre-ordered it.
[9455.42 --> 9456.06]  The Mysteries?
[9456.16 --> 9456.86]  Immediately, yeah.
[9457.88 --> 9461.50]  So it was done in collaboration with John Cashed.
[9461.50 --> 9463.26]  I don't know how to pronounce his last name.
[9463.36 --> 9463.52]  Sure.
[9463.52 --> 9465.54]  I don't know who he is, but he's a characterist, apparently.
[9466.40 --> 9469.52]  That's what I was listening to an interview about it before the show started.
[9469.68 --> 9470.56]  That's what you're listening to.
[9470.72 --> 9472.60]  Yeah, that's what I got sort of sidetracked by.
[9474.52 --> 9475.44]  Mine arrived.
[9475.98 --> 9476.30]  Horror.
[9476.30 --> 9479.94]  Was it last week or early this week or something like that?
[9480.06 --> 9484.76]  I, I've briefly looked at the first two pages, but I've, I've, I'm, I'm, I'm not going to
[9484.76 --> 9485.94]  do this in multiple sittings.
[9485.94 --> 9488.54]  I'm going to, I'm going to read it through because it's, it's not, doesn't appear to be
[9488.54 --> 9489.24]  a lot of text.
[9489.40 --> 9493.46]  It's like a modern fable or something like, I can't remember exactly what it is.
[9493.68 --> 9494.58]  It is definitely.
[9494.96 --> 9496.02]  It's, it's on Amazon.
[9496.20 --> 9497.40]  It's under horror manga.
[9497.74 --> 9503.62]  From what I've seen, it is nothing like anything he has done before.
[9503.62 --> 9505.44]  No, it's not very highly rated either.
[9505.66 --> 9514.80]  Um, and I am having a hard time so far from the handful of pages that I have glanced through
[9514.80 --> 9522.12]  understanding, um, it, what it is and why.
[9522.60 --> 9526.92]  And, um, you know what, realistically, I don't care.
[9526.92 --> 9533.14]  Um, I broke the no preordering rule because, uh, Bill Watterson through Calvin and Hobbes
[9533.14 --> 9538.72]  has given me so much joy in my life that I could probably never repay him for it.
[9539.12 --> 9543.76]  Um, so as far as I was concerned, it was just here, take my money.
[9543.88 --> 9544.04]  Yeah.
[9544.06 --> 9544.92]  Here, take my money.
[9544.92 --> 9548.60]  Cause I just, I actually don't give a shit, um, how good or bad this is.
[9549.10 --> 9555.66]  Um, but it does seem to be just kind of random.
[9555.66 --> 9561.64]  Um, um, I haven't actually looked at ratings because I wanted to just keep my impressions
[9561.64 --> 9563.88]  of it completely pure.
[9564.06 --> 9567.36]  So I'm not going to be looking at, you know, chat about it, but yeah, it's a, it's a new
[9567.36 --> 9571.76]  Bill Watterson book, the mysteries, and it has this kind of unique art style.
[9571.76 --> 9574.02]  And I guess I'm really not much of an artist.
[9574.16 --> 9580.58]  I, I, um, I was more expecting, you know, the writing to say something to me and less sort
[9580.58 --> 9581.76]  of concerned about the pictures.
[9582.54 --> 9584.24]  Um, yeah, that Bill Watterson.
[9584.24 --> 9587.06]  Can I show, uh, individual frames of it?
[9587.14 --> 9587.82]  I am, no.
[9587.92 --> 9588.96]  Including some writing?
[9589.82 --> 9590.42]  If they're on Amazon.
[9590.42 --> 9591.38]  It's on the Amazon page.
[9591.40 --> 9593.02]  If it's on the Amazon page, I'm pretty sure it's fair game.
[9593.02 --> 9593.24]  Okay.
[9593.30 --> 9596.56]  If you're, if you're freaked out about anything, whatever, there you go.
[9596.56 --> 9601.70]  So, so there's like tiny little bit of text long ago, the forest was dark and deep paired
[9601.70 --> 9606.38]  with picture and then tiny little bit of text.
[9606.38 --> 9611.54]  So the night set off into the misty forest year after year, they searched and then picture
[9611.54 --> 9620.00]  that match your experience.
[9620.30 --> 9620.66]  Yep.
[9626.56 --> 9632.90]  So I'm looking forward to it.
[9633.20 --> 9637.24]  Um, it doesn't matter if it's good.
[9637.38 --> 9638.56]  I mean, it might be good.
[9638.64 --> 9642.14]  It might be like good art or something and then maybe I don't get it, but just not your
[9642.14 --> 9642.62]  kind of thing.
[9642.72 --> 9642.82]  Yeah.
[9642.84 --> 9644.92]  It doesn't matter if it's good or bad or whatever.
[9645.42 --> 9648.76]  Um, it's, it's again, it's filed under horror manga.
[9649.02 --> 9654.16]  If I, if I was walking through a bookstore and I saw that as a category section, I would
[9654.16 --> 9654.96]  not be pausing.
[9654.96 --> 9657.90]  I'm just not interested in the slightest.
[9658.36 --> 9658.72]  Yeah.
[9658.84 --> 9659.28]  Me neither.
[9659.28 --> 9665.26]  I, I, I see also under frequently bought together on Amazon, there's this book and then the Calvin
[9665.26 --> 9667.00]  Hobbes portable compendium set.
[9669.60 --> 9672.02]  And those are very different things.
[9672.26 --> 9678.18]  And I think, I think, yeah, I think a lot of people that are coming to this for Bill
[9678.18 --> 9687.38]  Watterson and Bill Watterson's Calvin Hobbes contributions might be a little reacting the
[9687.38 --> 9689.46]  way you are being like, what even is this?
[9689.54 --> 9689.72]  Yep.
[9689.72 --> 9694.98]  But then maybe people that are into horror manga, whatever that is, are super into it.
[9695.56 --> 9695.92]  Maybe.
[9696.20 --> 9696.78]  I don't know.
[9697.02 --> 9706.66]  This has low ratings, but when I look through the ratings, uh, I think it's, I think it's
[9706.66 --> 9709.02]  people that were like, I liked Calvin and Hobbes.
[9709.12 --> 9709.84]  What is this?
[9710.06 --> 9715.26]  I think you only get one of these as an author or as an artist.
[9715.40 --> 9720.02]  I think you, I think you do get a mulligan or like, uh, you know, something that doesn't
[9720.02 --> 9722.84]  appeal to your fan base once, maybe twice.
[9722.84 --> 9728.10]  But I think if he, if he wants to like make a return to, you know, being one of the most
[9728.10 --> 9735.60]  beloved artists of this generation, you know, the next one should, without being fan service,
[9735.72 --> 9739.56]  probably appeal to the fan base a little bit.
[9739.86 --> 9742.10]  Um, I'm not going to tell him how to do this thing.
[9742.10 --> 9746.88]  Cause obviously man doesn't give a fuck like, and you got to respect that.
[9747.00 --> 9750.90]  So again, like it's back to, it's back to sort of like, I don't actually care because
[9750.90 --> 9757.76]  I respect the attitude and I respect the previous work to the point where I, what, $25 or whatever.
[9757.86 --> 9758.00]  Okay.
[9758.02 --> 9758.74]  Just take it.
[9758.74 --> 9759.66]  Uh, fine.
[9759.96 --> 9763.70]  It doesn't matter to me because he would never merchandise the IP.
[9764.02 --> 9768.26]  So I can't buy my kids a Hobbes stuffy, which I would happily do.
[9768.82 --> 9773.60]  Um, so all right, if this is the only way I can give you money, then I guess fine.
[9778.60 --> 9779.04]  Okay.
[9779.60 --> 9780.50]  Tell me this.
[9780.90 --> 9790.40]  Would it be wrong for me to leverage my supplier relationships with stuffy manufacturers to
[9790.40 --> 9792.12]  make a one-off Hobbes stuffy?
[9792.86 --> 9798.02]  I think as long as you make something for yourself and not for commercial use, it's covered by fair
[9798.02 --> 9798.38]  use.
[9800.46 --> 9801.66]  Is that wrong?
[9801.94 --> 9804.50]  Knowing what I know about him, not wanting.
[9804.68 --> 9805.92]  Why does he not want that?
[9806.44 --> 9808.22]  Because he thinks it cheapens the art.
[9808.22 --> 9815.50]  Also, I think there's a whole philosophical thing about, you know, if he ever did a stuffed
[9815.50 --> 9819.44]  Hobbes, then it would answer the question once and for all whether Hobbes is real or whether
[9819.44 --> 9820.04]  he's imagined.
[9820.04 --> 9823.90]  But it's pretty obvious he's imagined.
[9824.14 --> 9824.22]  Yeah.
[9824.38 --> 9828.38]  But that's something he has never actually canonically addressed.
[9828.88 --> 9830.48]  Well, it wouldn't be made by him.
[9830.70 --> 9832.46]  So I don't think you'd be ruining that question.
[9833.28 --> 9834.70]  And I wouldn't be selling it.
[9834.80 --> 9835.84]  I wouldn't be commercializing it.
[9835.84 --> 9842.34]  But if I had a one-off manufactured Hobbes for my kid or something like that, is that
[9842.34 --> 9842.66]  wrong?
[9842.76 --> 9843.22]  Tell me, guys.
[9844.88 --> 9845.50]  Oh, man.
[9845.56 --> 9846.70]  People are all over this.
[9847.06 --> 9847.36]  Yes.
[9847.46 --> 9851.56]  I feel like if you made it yourself, I feel like the vast majority of people would be cool
[9851.56 --> 9851.88]  with it.
[9852.12 --> 9855.76]  I feel like getting it manufactured by someone else is going to result in a significant
[9855.76 --> 9856.82]  amount of people saying no.
[9856.82 --> 9860.36]  So I think that's the line.
[9860.56 --> 9861.92]  I'm saying I bet they exist on Etsy.
[9861.96 --> 9862.98]  I'd actually be surprised.
[9866.04 --> 9866.62]  Let's see.
[9866.78 --> 9866.92]  Oh.
[9868.56 --> 9868.96]  Yep.
[9869.66 --> 9870.42]  Definitely a thing.
[9872.42 --> 9873.60]  XL stuffed tiger.
[9875.18 --> 9875.58]  Ugh.
[9876.20 --> 9876.60]  Yeah.
[9878.08 --> 9878.94]  What is this?
[9882.54 --> 9882.94]  What?
[9886.82 --> 9887.60]  Oh, man.
[9887.64 --> 9888.96]  These are terrible.
[9889.18 --> 9890.60]  No wonder he didn't want anybody making them.
[9891.54 --> 9892.04]  All right.
[9892.12 --> 9893.38]  Well, I guess we won't bother with that.
[9894.18 --> 9894.76]  I don't know.
[9894.88 --> 9896.18]  I was just curious.
[9896.64 --> 9899.00]  People are saying, I think if you made it yourself, it'd be much safer.
[9899.08 --> 9901.60]  I mean, I'm not actually worried about getting in any sort of legal trouble.
[9901.60 --> 9906.60]  The damages that could be claimed from me making one unit and keeping it for myself are
[9906.60 --> 9907.28]  literally zero.
[9908.56 --> 9912.42]  I'm just, I wanted to just have a conversation here.
[9912.52 --> 9913.58]  Like, where's the line?
[9913.58 --> 9919.36]  You know, obviously you couldn't just commercially produce Calvin and Hobbes plushies without his
[9919.36 --> 9928.16]  express permission, which is why his publishers probably like, this sucks.
[9928.34 --> 9931.04]  Oh, could have made so much money.
[9931.34 --> 9937.48]  At Calvin and Hobbes' peak, man, every kid would have wanted a Tickle Me Hobbes or whatever
[9937.48 --> 9938.98]  for Christmas or whatever it is.
[9938.98 --> 9943.68]  But then, you know, maybe that's part of why it's had this kind of lasting appeal is it
[9943.68 --> 9945.60]  is, it does only exist in the comics.
[9946.68 --> 9949.62]  And it wasn't cheapened in that way.
[9950.20 --> 9951.26]  It wasn't Star Wars.
[9951.64 --> 9952.00]  Commercialized.
[9952.08 --> 9952.30]  Yeah.
[9953.40 --> 9954.76]  Man, I'm so tired of Star Wars.
[9954.96 --> 9955.34]  Me too.
[9956.78 --> 9961.50]  If there was any other Calvin and Hobbes, I'd be all over it, right?
[9961.60 --> 9963.42]  Like, always leave them wanting more, right?
[9963.46 --> 9964.28]  First rule of show business.
[9964.40 --> 9967.24]  And we went to the new Star Wars ones at the beginning.
[9967.32 --> 9968.14]  Did we see all three of them?
[9968.14 --> 9968.72]  I don't remember.
[9971.74 --> 9972.48]  I don't remember.
[9972.74 --> 9973.20]  I don't know.
[9973.54 --> 9977.80]  We definitely saw the last one of the new, of the, like, sequel trilogy together.
[9978.08 --> 9978.28]  Yeah.
[9978.36 --> 9979.60]  I don't think we saw the first one together.
[9980.90 --> 9981.48]  Oh, yeah.
[9981.50 --> 9982.26]  I went with my family.
[9982.50 --> 9982.74]  Yeah.
[9983.64 --> 9984.72]  But I'm pretty sure we saw the...
[9984.72 --> 9986.14]  Yeah, like, what a...
[9986.14 --> 9987.72]  I never even thought about this before.
[9987.90 --> 9989.02]  What a sign of failure.
[9989.34 --> 9994.86]  The first new Star Wars coming out for me, my entire family, who were all cheap, like I
[9994.86 --> 9995.00]  am.
[9995.20 --> 10001.92]  My entire family went out to the, like, deluxe theater that has the, like, really comfy chairs.
[10002.04 --> 10003.42]  Everyone even just, like...
[10003.42 --> 10007.76]  You could tell everyone even dressed up relatively nicely.
[10008.44 --> 10008.70]  Yeah.
[10008.82 --> 10012.12]  Like, we were ready to experience Star Wars again.
[10012.12 --> 10016.42]  And we never did that for any of the following releases.
[10017.02 --> 10017.28]  Yikes.
[10017.34 --> 10019.62]  And I don't think anyone even talked about it.
[10021.62 --> 10024.30]  I've never even really thought about that since then.
[10024.30 --> 10027.32]  But, like, I don't think it was ever brought up again as, like, even an idea.
[10027.32 --> 10029.32]  Um, so...
[10029.32 --> 10031.64]  So there was that.
[10031.66 --> 10036.10]  Garon Ninja in floatplane chat says, I have refused to watch episode 9.
[10036.44 --> 10038.58]  I value the price of a ticket more.
[10039.08 --> 10039.42]  Oof.
[10039.90 --> 10040.36]  Oof.
[10040.96 --> 10042.80]  You don't even have to buy the popcorn.
[10043.16 --> 10045.74]  And you still value the ticket price more.
[10047.28 --> 10047.80]  Yikes.
[10049.16 --> 10049.64]  Yeah.
[10051.02 --> 10051.64]  All right.
[10051.68 --> 10052.66]  Anyways, After Dark?
[10052.82 --> 10054.40]  Yeah, Dan, you want to hit me with some merch messages?
[10054.66 --> 10055.06]  Yeah, sure.
[10055.12 --> 10056.62]  We got quite a few today.
[10056.62 --> 10058.98]  Um, also a bunch of potentials.
[10059.02 --> 10061.28]  If you guys want to go through those while I read these out to you.
[10061.66 --> 10063.70]  We'll start one with Luke, I guess.
[10064.00 --> 10064.20]  Hmm.
[10064.74 --> 10067.92]  I was once in my life tight on money.
[10068.04 --> 10072.76]  And now I often feel guilty for buying expensive components, despite being able to afford them.
[10073.08 --> 10075.62]  What's a tech product you bought that made you feel guilty?
[10079.62 --> 10079.90]  Hmm.
[10083.48 --> 10083.88]  Hmm.
[10084.56 --> 10085.16]  Not very many.
[10085.16 --> 10089.12]  Because I feel like I think it out pretty thoroughly before I buy stuff.
[10090.86 --> 10092.12]  Even stuff like the Nia.
[10092.30 --> 10095.80]  I didn't feel guilty because I found it fascinating.
[10096.14 --> 10098.40]  And I actually had got a lot of use out of it.
[10098.46 --> 10103.64]  Just like trying to figure out how exactly it worked and trying to figure out all its quirks and stuff like that.
[10103.64 --> 10106.60]  Um, I find a lot of value in...
[10106.60 --> 10110.30]  Yeah.
[10111.30 --> 10111.88]  That one.
[10112.56 --> 10114.60]  I find a lot of value in...
[10115.26 --> 10116.68]  Wait, did you know I was going to say that?
[10116.80 --> 10117.68]  You already looked it up?
[10118.06 --> 10118.78]  No, I did this after.
[10118.78 --> 10118.98]  Okay.
[10118.98 --> 10123.14]  This is me playing Pong with my brain using the Nia.
[10123.32 --> 10124.86]  The thing that Luke just referred to.
[10124.94 --> 10126.24]  The neural impulse actuator.
[10126.52 --> 10126.72]  Yeah.
[10128.64 --> 10129.72]  You got pretty good.
[10129.98 --> 10131.42]  That was like...
[10131.42 --> 10134.44]  It actually took a lot of concentration to do that.
[10135.98 --> 10137.22]  It was funny too because...
[10137.22 --> 10138.26]  I just have a powerful brain.
[10138.38 --> 10138.78]  What can I say?
[10139.30 --> 10141.66]  I used to try to play COD with it.
[10142.66 --> 10143.92]  Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
[10144.24 --> 10145.02]  The first one.
[10145.52 --> 10147.30]  Had released around the same time.
[10147.62 --> 10149.86]  And I bound a few different inputs to the Nia.
[10150.38 --> 10151.26]  And I...
[10151.26 --> 10153.22]  I got okay.
[10153.62 --> 10155.02]  I could have a positive KD.
[10155.38 --> 10157.52]  But I was like quite good at that game at the time.
[10157.56 --> 10158.74]  So that was not a lot.
[10159.22 --> 10160.10]  Um...
[10160.10 --> 10162.54]  But I was not losing to other players.
[10162.72 --> 10166.58]  While controlling firing and aim down sight with the Nia.
[10167.16 --> 10169.38]  So I moved with the keyboard with my hand.
[10169.68 --> 10171.38]  And I looked with the mouse.
[10171.76 --> 10174.80]  And I would fire an ADS with my brain.
[10175.62 --> 10176.66]  But it was hilarious.
[10176.78 --> 10178.88]  Because like someone would come up to my desk to talk to me.
[10179.28 --> 10181.22]  And I would like look at them and start talking.
[10181.34 --> 10182.46]  And my character was just like...
[10182.46 --> 10183.24]  Aim, aim, aim, aim, aim.
[10183.30 --> 10183.84]  Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[10184.86 --> 10185.64]  It's like...
[10185.64 --> 10186.36]  Oh my god.
[10188.30 --> 10188.86]  But yeah.
[10188.90 --> 10189.22]  I don't know.
[10189.22 --> 10190.86]  I can't really think of any major...
[10190.86 --> 10191.96]  I'm sure some exist.
[10195.46 --> 10196.84]  I can't really think of it though.
[10199.42 --> 10199.78]  Okay.
[10200.14 --> 10200.38]  Yeah.
[10200.44 --> 10202.52]  Most tech products that I've bought have not broken.
[10202.52 --> 10204.64]  I've had very good success with that.
[10205.96 --> 10207.44]  I've used them pretty thoroughly.
[10207.70 --> 10209.62]  And even when they weren't necessarily that great.
[10209.76 --> 10212.92]  I usually predicted that that might be a possible outcome.
[10213.10 --> 10215.82]  And was more interested in playing with it.
[10215.96 --> 10218.54]  In its not necessarily perfect state.
[10218.54 --> 10220.78]  Because I thought that would be interesting.
[10221.00 --> 10223.56]  Hence early versions of Oculus Rift headsets.
[10223.64 --> 10224.22]  Stuff like that.
[10224.72 --> 10225.16]  But yeah.
[10225.28 --> 10225.54]  Sorry.
[10226.88 --> 10229.18]  I've got one here that might be interesting to both of you.
[10229.60 --> 10230.36]  Hi, LLD.
[10230.62 --> 10232.80]  I am doing some necessary work from home.
[10233.02 --> 10234.10]  Hourly employee.
[10234.58 --> 10235.90]  And track my own hours.
[10236.08 --> 10237.04]  And I'm a college student.
[10237.44 --> 10238.56]  I'm incredibly efficient.
[10238.56 --> 10240.88]  Do I track my actual time?
[10241.02 --> 10244.24]  Or roughly how long it would take others to do?
[10250.24 --> 10250.64]  Hmm.
[10252.32 --> 10253.60]  Your actual time?
[10255.60 --> 10256.56]  Because like you're not...
[10257.42 --> 10258.56]  If you're paid piecework.
[10258.66 --> 10261.00]  Then you would track it by the project.
[10261.22 --> 10262.44]  But if you're paid hourly.
[10262.58 --> 10263.72]  Then you're paid hourly.
[10264.00 --> 10264.22]  Right?
[10264.22 --> 10266.88]  I mean it all kind of depends on what your employment contract is.
[10266.88 --> 10267.06]  Right?
[10270.18 --> 10272.24]  I mean if you're incredibly efficient.
[10272.68 --> 10275.08]  Then I would suggest.
[10275.58 --> 10278.88]  That a cool way to parlay that into more money.
[10278.88 --> 10280.42]  Would be to get a lot done.
[10280.50 --> 10281.52]  And then ask for a promotion.
[10282.16 --> 10283.50]  And then if they don't give you a promotion.
[10283.72 --> 10285.94]  Then I would take that incredible efficiency.
[10286.58 --> 10288.34]  And take that to a competitor.
[10288.64 --> 10289.64]  And interview there.
[10289.78 --> 10291.56]  And talk about how incredibly efficient you are.
[10291.62 --> 10294.62]  And how you probably deserve more compensation.
[10294.62 --> 10296.86]  Or a higher position than what you have now.
[10296.90 --> 10297.28]  With that said.
[10297.30 --> 10297.88]  If you're a student.
[10297.88 --> 10302.16]  And you're not ready to kind of start climbing the corporate ladder.
[10302.30 --> 10303.54]  That may not be feasible for you.
[10303.68 --> 10306.40]  But it would all just kind of depend on.
[10307.34 --> 10309.84]  What your employment agreement looks like.
[10309.84 --> 10312.10]  And what your liability could look like.
[10312.10 --> 10314.20]  If you're found to be fraudulently reporting your hours.
[10314.20 --> 10315.30]  Or whatever the case may be.
[10317.04 --> 10317.64]  I don't know.
[10317.68 --> 10320.24]  Is there anything else to kind of add to that?
[10320.34 --> 10320.96]  That seemed pretty good.
[10322.24 --> 10324.58]  What other types of leather were you looking at?
[10324.58 --> 10326.80]  Why did you go with apple leather specifically?
[10327.62 --> 10329.84]  Also excellent choice on interior color.
[10330.28 --> 10330.76]  Orange is great.
[10330.84 --> 10332.52]  But I love this blue teal color.
[10332.74 --> 10333.32]  More please.
[10335.44 --> 10337.06]  What made us decide on apple leather.
[10337.06 --> 10339.50]  Was just how good it was.
[10339.50 --> 10341.28]  We tried pineapple leather.
[10341.50 --> 10342.24]  Mushroom leather.
[10342.76 --> 10344.96]  A couple different types of apple leather.
[10345.18 --> 10351.34]  And we just felt that this was the closest to the real leather experience.
[10351.34 --> 10353.76]  Without actually making it out of real leather.
[10353.76 --> 10354.42]  Which has.
[10354.90 --> 10357.62]  Which is much higher in terms of cost.
[10357.86 --> 10361.48]  And also much more difficult to work with.
[10361.60 --> 10363.42]  Which affects cost.
[10363.78 --> 10365.96]  So we just love the material.
[10366.18 --> 10367.24]  That's what it comes down to.
[10367.32 --> 10367.46]  And yeah.
[10367.46 --> 10368.44]  I really like the teal too.
[10371.24 --> 10372.64]  Question mostly for Luke.
[10373.02 --> 10375.38]  What happened to the IA race?
[10375.88 --> 10377.34]  Went from new things every week.
[10377.44 --> 10379.34]  To mostly implementations of.
[10379.42 --> 10379.60]  AI.
[10379.92 --> 10380.68]  I guess so.
[10380.84 --> 10381.54]  AI race.
[10381.62 --> 10382.80]  Went from new things every week.
[10382.80 --> 10386.14]  To mostly implementations of what is already there.
[10386.14 --> 10388.66]  We were vaguely talking about this earlier in the show.
[10388.76 --> 10390.78]  But costs are astronomically high.
[10391.00 --> 10394.06]  And also I think we just ran into the realities.
[10394.34 --> 10394.54]  Okay.
[10394.58 --> 10395.46]  There's two things I guess.
[10395.52 --> 10401.12]  One of them is just the realities of actually shipping an actual real product being really hard.
[10401.12 --> 10405.18]  And then also the hallucination problem is.
[10406.68 --> 10411.38]  A big issue for shipping a product to a wider percentage of users.
[10411.38 --> 10412.30]  I don't know if you remember.
[10412.48 --> 10413.92]  But early on in the whole AI thing.
[10414.00 --> 10417.34]  The amount of debates we'd have to get into with our own audience.
[10417.34 --> 10422.70]  Talking about how early versions of ChatGPT couldn't access the internet.
[10422.70 --> 10426.34]  Because it would just convince them it was accessing the internet.
[10426.48 --> 10428.66]  And they were so sure that it was actually happening.
[10429.14 --> 10432.20]  You'd see people on Reddit with massively uprooted threads.
[10432.40 --> 10439.20]  Being like I tricked it to get it to allow me to do searches with it through the internet.
[10439.20 --> 10439.64]  No.
[10440.16 --> 10442.70]  It tricked you into thinking that it did that successfully.
[10443.42 --> 10447.70]  So those hallucinations are an issue for wide market adoption.
[10449.14 --> 10450.24]  And we've been.
[10450.38 --> 10452.22]  Not we as if I'm involved.
[10452.22 --> 10456.14]  But the industry has been stuck on those things for this whole time.
[10456.52 --> 10457.42]  Shipping products is hard.
[10457.68 --> 10459.08]  Solving hallucinations is hard.
[10459.38 --> 10460.08]  Costs are very high.
[10461.16 --> 10461.52]  That's it.
[10462.26 --> 10463.34]  Hi, Linus and company.
[10463.54 --> 10464.74]  I have just one question.
[10465.08 --> 10470.08]  Have you had any problems growing panes with the $1,000 JBOD cabinet?
[10473.40 --> 10473.84]  No.
[10474.66 --> 10477.72]  I mean, we're also not using it.
[10477.72 --> 10480.74]  If you're referring to the thing that I think you're referring to.
[10480.74 --> 10489.52]  Which is that NetApp appliance that we picked up during the liquidation of that company that was switching to work from home.
[10489.52 --> 10496.74]  Like we fired it up just to kind of show you guys what that kind of equipment looks like.
[10496.74 --> 10500.76]  And, you know, how it works and talk about why some people use it.
[10500.76 --> 10503.04]  But it's worth far more.
[10503.04 --> 10510.62]  Like the value of it was in the drive sleds for those JBOD boxes rather than.
[10510.82 --> 10515.44]  And in like replacement power supplies and stuff rather than as an actual functioning unit.
[10515.44 --> 10521.44]  Because the power costs of running it were so high compared to the actual storage capacity and performance.
[10521.44 --> 10529.28]  I mean, you could have like a handful of SSDs these days running in, you know, an Intel Atom box.
[10529.28 --> 10534.08]  And it would probably perform better while consuming a tiny fraction of the amount of power.
[10534.16 --> 10535.88]  Like it made no sense to actually run the thing.
[10535.88 --> 10548.32]  But I know that at least one employee bought one of the drive shelves and took it home without me really knowing that we had made those kinds of deals.
[10548.32 --> 10550.48]  And that we were getting rid of them.
[10550.82 --> 10552.06]  You can have it back if you want.
[10552.14 --> 10552.92]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10552.92 --> 10553.30]  It's fine.
[10553.40 --> 10556.40]  The density is pretty low for our deployments these days.
[10556.48 --> 10557.46]  I just didn't know.
[10557.46 --> 10567.20]  And the only reason that I found out was because another employee was sniffing around in the warehouse trying to steal one.
[10567.52 --> 10569.04]  And was like, hey, where'd one of those go?
[10570.36 --> 10571.52]  We can share.
[10571.90 --> 10572.74]  Yeah, exactly.
[10573.54 --> 10581.26]  And hey, and maybe if that NAS software investment that I made ever pans out, we can have backup targets to each other.
[10581.34 --> 10582.92]  So we have geo-replication.
[10583.02 --> 10583.58]  It'll be great.
[10583.80 --> 10584.30]  That'll be fun.
[10584.52 --> 10585.40]  I know, right?
[10585.40 --> 10588.02]  I just wanted something to play with and it was the right price.
[10588.12 --> 10590.54]  But I mean, if you want to do stuff with it, you're welcome.
[10590.54 --> 10591.74]  No, for real, I don't care.
[10591.84 --> 10592.02]  Okay.
[10592.18 --> 10592.32]  Yeah.
[10594.44 --> 10599.28]  I just, I love that logistics apparently just makes decisions about what stuff we're selling to staff now.
[10599.36 --> 10605.94]  I better like ask people next time I want something because I assume that that's all kosher.
[10606.12 --> 10614.18]  I've poked them about it, but I'm hoping to be able to snipe at some point in time some of those wood-accented parts.
[10615.40 --> 10616.44]  Hmm.
[10617.56 --> 10618.98]  You're probably not the only one.
[10619.28 --> 10619.82]  I know.
[10620.00 --> 10622.50]  You've got to be nice to them or be an ex-manager.
[10624.72 --> 10626.50]  You've got to know how to talk to them, Luke.
[10627.10 --> 10627.46]  Okay.
[10627.56 --> 10630.78]  That's not how that's supposed to work, but okay.
[10632.20 --> 10633.98]  Anywho, what were we talking about again?
[10634.72 --> 10635.12]  Oh, yeah.
[10635.26 --> 10635.74]  So I haven't done anything with it.
[10635.74 --> 10637.04]  For the record, that is a joke.
[10637.04 --> 10642.40]  Yeah, we have parts that we will probably use for stoofs or staff.
[10642.58 --> 10643.10]  We'll play with them.
[10643.20 --> 10643.70]  I'm not sure.
[10643.88 --> 10644.40]  Stoofs?
[10644.82 --> 10645.10]  Staff.
[10645.50 --> 10645.72]  Okay.
[10647.70 --> 10651.84]  Up next, would Linus consider oil to be sufficiently waterproof?
[10653.42 --> 10653.96]  No.
[10653.96 --> 10666.78]  I mean, no, actually, because a small amount of even a non-water-soluble material or non-whatever,
[10667.16 --> 10669.30]  yeah, or you can use an emulsifying agent.
[10670.12 --> 10670.72]  No.
[10671.02 --> 10672.38]  Nothing is waterproof.
[10673.30 --> 10675.20]  Eventually, water conquers all.
[10675.72 --> 10675.92]  Yeah.
[10675.92 --> 10678.86]  Hi, DLL.
[10679.46 --> 10683.92]  Recently, NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission came back from an asteroid with samples.
[10684.46 --> 10688.54]  A lot of these asteroids have a ton of precious minerals used in computers.
[10688.86 --> 10691.06]  What are your thoughts on space mining?
[10692.04 --> 10692.98]  Oh, it's totally going to be a thing.
[10693.58 --> 10699.28]  I think we're far from it being like an actual thing that is actually happening, but it will
[10699.28 --> 10700.48]  totally be a thing eventually.
[10700.48 --> 10706.90]  Um, we need things to be like significantly more reusable, significantly more efficient,
[10706.90 --> 10710.20]  but those things are trending upwards at a surprising rate.
[10710.50 --> 10714.68]  Um, it's happening and it's going to be a thing because yeah, some of those asteroids
[10714.68 --> 10717.08]  are very rich in minerals.
[10717.44 --> 10721.42]  Um, I don't even know if it'll happen.
[10721.42 --> 10723.18]  Isn't there a giant one that's like made of gold or something?
[10723.48 --> 10723.64]  Platinum?
[10724.30 --> 10728.90]  Um, there's like, yeah, there's a, there's a lot of money flying around in space.
[10728.90 --> 10733.98]  Um, I don't know if it's going to be like a common or reasonable thing, even in my lifespan,
[10733.98 --> 10736.78]  but it will definitely be a thing at some point.
[10737.06 --> 10738.40]  I am a hundred percent certain.
[10741.36 --> 10747.64]  Luke, uh, how do you feel about the upcoming extraction shooter Vanguard from EVE online
[10747.64 --> 10749.70]  developer CCP Games?
[10749.96 --> 10752.72]  Interested in merch for a trip to Norway as well.
[10754.08 --> 10755.98]  Interested in merch for a trip to Norway?
[10756.24 --> 10756.48]  What?
[10756.48 --> 10760.76]  Um, I think that's, uh, just, he's excited for merch.
[10760.96 --> 10764.52]  Oh, he's buying merch, probably warm stuff because he's going to Norway.
[10764.68 --> 10764.86]  Okay.
[10764.86 --> 10765.06]  Sorry.
[10765.12 --> 10765.24]  Cool.
[10765.30 --> 10765.52]  Yes.
[10765.70 --> 10766.90]  I'm assuming, I don't know.
[10767.26 --> 10768.40]  Um, yeah, I don't know.
[10768.46 --> 10769.46]  I'm pretty excited.
[10769.94 --> 10781.30]  Um, but to be completely honest, a lot of what I like about Tarkov is not the fact that
[10781.30 --> 10782.64]  it's an extraction shooter.
[10783.96 --> 10789.36]  Um, it's a lot of the intricacies of how the game works.
[10789.90 --> 10793.52]  Um, that being said, I really like the EVE universe.
[10793.52 --> 10797.34]  Um, my biggest problem with EVE is just how dated the game is.
[10797.80 --> 10803.54]  Um, I was really excited for the last FPS that the, uh, EVE developers worked on.
[10803.90 --> 10809.44]  Um, but it ended up being like a PlayStation exclusive, which was the weirdest and also
[10809.44 --> 10810.28]  worst move.
[10810.28 --> 10816.86]  I think I've seen a company make regarding exclusives, like potentially ever because their
[10816.86 --> 10822.02]  entire fan base of customers were PC gamers specifically.
[10822.28 --> 10828.96]  And then they released a PlayStation only FPS game, which is just like, what are you doing?
[10829.16 --> 10836.32]  Um, so if they can avoid that really, really, really weird, uh, decision this time, uh, maybe
[10836.32 --> 10836.88]  it would be good.
[10836.88 --> 10840.10]  I hope, I really hope, I don't know, I have done no research on this.
[10840.32 --> 10845.06]  I hope it's like legitimately grounded in the EVE universe, just like the way the previous
[10845.06 --> 10845.60]  one was.
[10845.64 --> 10847.66]  So it interacts with the EVE online universe.
[10847.76 --> 10851.38]  I think that'd be super sick, but honestly, if it's not, uh, it's fine.
[10853.36 --> 10853.76]  Yeah.
[10854.68 --> 10855.08]  Yeah.
[10855.16 --> 10855.36]  Okay.
[10855.40 --> 10856.02]  No, it does.
[10856.14 --> 10857.90]  Oh, see, that's so cool to me.
[10858.14 --> 10861.60]  Members of the Vanguard will fuel the war machine of New Eden.
[10861.74 --> 10864.10]  New Eden is the, the, that's where EVE is.
[10864.10 --> 10869.16]  Um, in new ways, adding corruption to the front lines, delivering vital resources to
[10869.16 --> 10873.80]  the EVE economy and completing contracts that turn the tide of battle, serve the Vanguard
[10873.80 --> 10877.58]  or serve those who seek an advantage in the raging wars of EVE online.
[10879.16 --> 10880.68]  That's really cool.
[10880.82 --> 10886.90]  I really like the idea that they've clearly had for a very long time of tying a on the
[10886.90 --> 10893.62]  ground FPS game and the, uh, strategy coordination of EVE online together.
[10893.82 --> 10898.86]  That concept has been fascinating and awesome to me since the original time that they announced
[10898.86 --> 10899.08]  it.
[10899.16 --> 10900.66]  They fubbed the first one.
[10901.34 --> 10903.60]  If this one hits, that would be great.
[10903.72 --> 10907.44]  And I will absolutely give it a shot in hopefully December, 2023.
[10908.14 --> 10908.60]  Yeah.
[10908.60 --> 10914.34]  Hey, LLD, I was wondering if there's any Mac address, game linked and even float plane
[10914.34 --> 10917.62]  merch in the works, specifically some color block hoodies.
[10918.02 --> 10918.28]  Thanks.
[10918.60 --> 10922.40]  We're probably not going to do more color block hoodies, but we do have a really interesting
[10922.40 --> 10924.86]  Mac address piece of merch that we've been working on.
[10925.02 --> 10929.80]  You know, that iconic Steve Jobs, black, not really a turtleneck sort of thing.
[10929.80 --> 10934.96]  I would, uh, I would wear that.
[10935.14 --> 10936.10]  That's pretty sick.
[10936.28 --> 10937.82]  We've had a lot of trouble with the collar.
[10938.96 --> 10945.48]  So it may be that, um, it takes a long time or it never sees the light of day or whatever
[10945.48 --> 10951.26]  else, but it like has a seam down the middle and it's got like this kind of cool neck and
[10951.26 --> 10953.08]  it's long black sleeves.
[10953.58 --> 10959.24]  Um, that's something that we thought would be kind of cool for Mac address for the others.
[10959.24 --> 10961.78]  I don't think we have anything planned at the moment though.
[10963.54 --> 10968.72]  Hey, DLL, my dad mocked me for buying an LTT screwdriver, but after assembling furniture
[10968.72 --> 10970.72]  with him, he asked me to get him too.
[10971.64 --> 10974.64]  What's your favorite purchase that someone told you was dumb?
[10978.12 --> 10979.62]  I've probably got a lot of those.
[10979.80 --> 10984.40]  I had a lot of, I've had a ton, you know, sorry, that probably sounded weird.
[10985.40 --> 10986.40]  My phone fell.
[10986.40 --> 10991.30]  I tried to catch it, but then I saw he was going for it too, and I didn't want to cause
[10991.30 --> 10991.82]  a collision.
[10991.96 --> 10992.52]  So I paused.
[10994.30 --> 10995.98]  Oh, I don't believe it.
[10996.46 --> 10997.80]  I just got a message from Nick White.
[10997.90 --> 10998.12]  I know.
[10998.16 --> 10999.02]  I'll believe it when I see it.
[10999.24 --> 10999.52]  Okay.
[10999.94 --> 11000.56]  You heard that Nick.
[11002.16 --> 11003.78]  Uh, man, we're, we're even talking about it.
[11003.78 --> 11004.46]  Get me in trouble, Dan.
[11004.62 --> 11005.10]  Oh yeah.
[11005.16 --> 11009.78]  There was a ton of people in my life that told me the mineral oil computer was stupid.
[11009.78 --> 11010.32]  It was.
[11010.32 --> 11011.14]  For a lot of reasons.
[11011.68 --> 11018.90]  And you could argue that it was, but not only did it 100% pay for itself many times
[11018.90 --> 11022.52]  over through, uh, scholarships and grants and stuff like that.
[11022.52 --> 11026.50]  But also it's how I made like all of my friends in university.
[11026.50 --> 11028.12]  It's how I got this job.
[11028.22 --> 11031.02]  It's like the reason for a ton of things.
[11031.02 --> 11034.56]  It helps me learn way more about computers.
[11035.28 --> 11037.78]  Um, it helps me learn tons of different things.
[11037.78 --> 11041.40]  So I, I, I strongly disagree.
[11041.40 --> 11044.96]  I mean, it's still stupid.
[11045.98 --> 11048.80]  I mean, technically on paper, it literally wasn't.
[11049.00 --> 11049.10]  Yeah.
[11049.18 --> 11050.40]  But like.
[11053.50 --> 11054.74]  You can say whatever you want.
[11055.16 --> 11058.12]  What's my favorite purchase someone told me was dumb.
[11058.70 --> 11061.14]  I mean, people tell me I'm dumb all the time.
[11062.46 --> 11064.40]  I wouldn't even say it's my favorite purchase though.
[11064.66 --> 11066.80]  Like I, it's fun, but it's not.
[11066.80 --> 11068.94]  Out of the category of things that people said were dumb.
[11069.02 --> 11070.54]  I think is how the question.
[11070.54 --> 11075.18]  Yeah, but like I have all, my life is full of things that people told me were dumb.
[11075.26 --> 11076.68]  I mean, that's super checks.
[11076.94 --> 11078.28]  I bought a, I bought a table.
[11078.68 --> 11079.62]  Probably the building.
[11079.78 --> 11080.76]  I'm sure somebody said it.
[11080.80 --> 11083.42]  I bought a tabletop game for $4,000.
[11083.92 --> 11085.40]  It plays only one game.
[11085.92 --> 11087.26]  I use it once a week.
[11087.36 --> 11093.58]  I could, I could literally spend like half my life in an arcade for like a year and not
[11093.58 --> 11095.34]  probably manage to spend that kind of money.
[11095.34 --> 11097.66]  I could just play that game all day if I really wanted to.
[11098.32 --> 11100.14]  Um, but.
[11100.54 --> 11104.64]  I really wanted a super checks and I put it in the employee lounge.
[11104.64 --> 11105.80]  It was a company purchase, wasn't it?
[11106.02 --> 11106.22]  Mm-hmm.
[11106.54 --> 11106.72]  Yeah.
[11106.88 --> 11108.76]  That's why it lives here instead of at my house.
[11108.82 --> 11109.42]  For the lounge.
[11109.54 --> 11109.80]  Yeah.
[11110.76 --> 11111.84]  Uh, man.
[11112.34 --> 11115.28]  Uh, favorite.
[11115.60 --> 11118.40]  See, man, it's so easy to think of things people told me were stupid.
[11118.52 --> 11119.30]  Having a pool is stupid.
[11119.46 --> 11120.50]  Everyone told me it was stupid.
[11120.50 --> 11122.92]  Um, the gold Xbox controller is stupid.
[11123.02 --> 11124.32]  Yeah, the chat's getting into it now.
[11125.32 --> 11125.68]  Um.
[11125.68 --> 11128.08]  First lab building?
[11128.16 --> 11129.54]  Yeah, lots of people told me that was stupid.
[11129.98 --> 11131.54]  It's definitely not my favorite thing.
[11131.90 --> 11132.96]  I, I don't know.
[11133.02 --> 11134.56]  What's my, what's my favorite thing?
[11134.62 --> 11136.60]  I don't really, I don't really.
[11137.24 --> 11137.54]  I don't really.
[11137.54 --> 11140.46]  It would be your favorite out of the ones that were said to be stupid.
[11140.60 --> 11143.68]  Yeah, but I'm just trying to think of like a favorite thing right now, to be honest with you.
[11143.78 --> 11144.56]  I, I don't really know.
[11144.56 --> 11148.14]  That, that, that, my whole point is it literally does not have to be your favorite thing.
[11148.22 --> 11149.98]  It's your favorite out of those.
[11150.10 --> 11150.54]  I know.
[11150.66 --> 11152.86]  Which could mean it's something that you don't even like very much.
[11153.02 --> 11154.30]  Oh, I mean, I guess so.
[11155.36 --> 11156.90]  Uh, okay.
[11157.82 --> 11159.90]  Yeah, I'm gonna go with Natipion.
[11160.72 --> 11161.62]  Lucky the dragon.
[11163.14 --> 11164.26]  That was really dumb.
[11164.26 --> 11164.86]  That was stupid.
[11164.96 --> 11165.78]  And I love it a lot.
[11165.82 --> 11166.58]  That was really dumb.
[11166.58 --> 11167.54]  I actually love Lucky.
[11168.52 --> 11168.92]  Yeah.
[11169.94 --> 11171.18]  That was so stupid.
[11171.98 --> 11174.12]  I, I straight up thought it was a joke.
[11174.56 --> 11175.46]  When you first did it.
[11175.56 --> 11176.64]  And then it never left.
[11176.72 --> 11179.70]  And I was like, what?
[11179.94 --> 11180.14]  Yeah.
[11180.16 --> 11181.88]  You know, he's just like at the lab now, right?
[11181.88 --> 11182.32]  Yeah.
[11182.32 --> 11182.38]  Yeah.
[11182.48 --> 11183.20]  He just lives there.
[11183.36 --> 11183.58]  Yeah.
[11184.26 --> 11184.94]  That's really weird.
[11185.24 --> 11185.46]  Yeah.
[11186.18 --> 11188.10]  I'm not even like an MSI fan.
[11188.34 --> 11188.78]  I know.
[11189.10 --> 11189.90]  But look at him.
[11189.96 --> 11192.58]  He's number one.
[11194.68 --> 11195.04]  Yeah.
[11195.26 --> 11195.48]  Yeah.
[11195.48 --> 11196.08]  Lucky the dragon.
[11196.74 --> 11197.10]  All right.
[11197.10 --> 11197.62]  Sounds good.
[11198.22 --> 11204.04]  I work as an internet technician in Michigan and we do cable and fiber and max out at gig.
[11204.56 --> 11206.20]  How does the internet work up in Canada?
[11206.66 --> 11207.90]  Fiber, DSL, cable.
[11208.26 --> 11211.28]  It seems like you guys have a lot faster maximum speed.
[11212.80 --> 11213.56]  Than where?
[11213.72 --> 11213.88]  Sorry.
[11214.46 --> 11214.86]  Michigan.
[11215.66 --> 11216.18]  Oh yeah.
[11216.46 --> 11217.34]  Well, okay.
[11217.36 --> 11221.62]  If you want to look up how the ISPs in your country scammed your entire country.
[11221.62 --> 11224.48]  And I don't understand why people aren't more angry about it all the time.
[11225.30 --> 11228.04]  Have a fun, fun time going down that rabbit hole.
[11229.42 --> 11229.92]  Tell us.
[11229.92 --> 11233.56]  Billions of dollars put into fiber networks that were never built because they just didn't
[11233.56 --> 11234.10]  feel like it.
[11234.48 --> 11234.68]  Yeah.
[11234.78 --> 11238.82]  Tell us has put a ton of investment into faster fiber to the home here over the last
[11238.82 --> 11239.58]  10 years or so.
[11239.72 --> 11239.98]  Oh yeah.
[11240.00 --> 11241.90]  Up until then, it was trash.
[11241.92 --> 11242.62]  It was really bad.
[11242.64 --> 11243.80]  It was really bad here.
[11244.18 --> 11246.02]  And it's honestly still pretty bad.
[11247.22 --> 11248.66]  It's getting a lot better, man.
[11248.74 --> 11251.26]  My last experience with this is from years ago.
[11251.60 --> 11253.96]  So saying it's still bad is not fair.
[11253.96 --> 11256.90]  But the last time I looked into it, it was still very bad with Shaw.
[11257.06 --> 11259.78]  They'll tell you you're getting fiber, but it's fiber to the node.
[11259.96 --> 11260.08]  Yeah.
[11260.12 --> 11262.78]  And then copper to the house, which is not fiber.
[11263.50 --> 11263.86]  Yeah.
[11264.58 --> 11267.38]  I mean, everything's fiber if you really want to be like that about it.
[11267.46 --> 11267.80]  Yeah.
[11268.34 --> 11268.70]  Yeah.
[11268.70 --> 11269.54]  It's fiber somewhere.
[11269.76 --> 11269.96]  Yeah.
[11270.02 --> 11270.76]  At some point.
[11270.88 --> 11271.36]  I don't know.
[11271.56 --> 11271.96]  So like.
[11272.10 --> 11272.30]  Yeah.
[11272.32 --> 11272.54]  No.
[11272.66 --> 11275.64]  Tell us does fiber to the home in our area in Western Canada.
[11275.98 --> 11277.82]  And it's ripping fast.
[11277.92 --> 11281.22]  It's reasonably attainable in terms of price.
[11281.32 --> 11282.14]  Very reliable.
[11282.14 --> 11284.16]  Very reliable.
[11284.44 --> 11286.50]  Like kind of astonishingly reliable.
[11286.62 --> 11286.74]  Yeah.
[11287.12 --> 11291.72]  To the point where like if my internet ever goes out, I assume it's my problem.
[11291.98 --> 11292.10]  Yeah.
[11292.18 --> 11293.68]  Whereas that was the opposite.
[11293.96 --> 11294.32]  Absolutely.
[11294.58 --> 11294.82]  Years ago.
[11295.06 --> 11295.20]  Yeah.
[11295.30 --> 11295.46]  Yeah.
[11295.58 --> 11296.20]  Internet goes out.
[11296.26 --> 11300.06]  You just instantly call them because you're like, well, they screwed something up.
[11300.16 --> 11302.28]  And now it's, yeah, not that way at all.
[11303.68 --> 11304.12]  Yeah.
[11305.40 --> 11307.10]  IDLL Vampire here.
[11307.44 --> 11310.20]  Wanted your thoughts on AR in enterprise.
[11310.20 --> 11314.62]  I mainly push it for virtualization and rapid prototyping by placing 3D models.
[11314.84 --> 11318.90]  But the main cell is hands-free screen a la Google Glass.
[11318.90 --> 11321.48]  Man, I don't know.
[11321.58 --> 11323.60]  I think we're a ways away from that.
[11323.82 --> 11326.66]  But then I haven't seen the Apple Vision Pro yet.
[11327.26 --> 11330.96]  It's possible that Vision Pro is going to totally change my perspective on this.
[11330.98 --> 11332.02]  And I'm going to go, oh, wow.
[11332.12 --> 11332.28]  Yeah.
[11332.36 --> 11332.54]  No.
[11332.64 --> 11334.54]  Virtual displays is totally a thing.
[11334.64 --> 11335.88]  And let's go immediately.
[11336.04 --> 11336.44]  Okay.
[11336.44 --> 11336.54]  Okay.
[11336.54 --> 11341.42]  I'm looking forward to trying it.
[11341.52 --> 11343.14]  I guess is all I can really say about that.
[11343.74 --> 11343.90]  Yeah.
[11345.10 --> 11348.76]  How's the wear and tear using the vegan leather on the Luxe backpack?
[11349.18 --> 11352.34]  Is Linus willing to show us the bottom of his prototype bag?
[11352.34 --> 11361.14]  Looks pretty good to me.
[11362.30 --> 11362.74]  I mean, here.
[11364.74 --> 11365.30]  Yeah.
[11365.86 --> 11368.46]  I don't see any imperfections.
[11368.52 --> 11369.60]  I'm not a leather person.
[11371.12 --> 11372.94]  Very few people are leather people.
[11374.74 --> 11375.58]  Here we go.
[11375.58 --> 11378.96]  Get you guys the best possible look at it.
[11380.20 --> 11386.52]  I have been floored by the resiliency of this material.
[11387.00 --> 11389.70]  Now, full disclosure, I hang my backpack at home.
[11390.10 --> 11392.48]  So I don't leave it on the floor at home.
[11392.78 --> 11395.40]  But I do chuck it in my trunk every day.
[11395.66 --> 11399.06]  And I do chuck it on the floor at work every day.
[11399.20 --> 11404.56]  And this is the hanger that I hang this weight by every day.
[11404.56 --> 11407.54]  And it's like perfect.
[11408.48 --> 11409.14]  Check out the hanger.
[11411.26 --> 11412.10]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11412.10 --> 11413.70]  There's no like crease though.
[11413.86 --> 11414.06]  Yeah.
[11414.24 --> 11417.40]  Well, I was doing this because I was like, I'm expecting I'm going to feel something.
[11417.50 --> 11418.32]  But there's nothing.
[11418.76 --> 11420.40]  And it also, yeah, there's no noticeable.
[11420.74 --> 11421.02]  Yep.
[11421.18 --> 11421.52]  Interesting.
[11422.46 --> 11424.22]  I'm so happy with this material.
[11427.02 --> 11427.98]  Hey, LLD.
[11428.20 --> 11429.04]  Love the content.
[11429.40 --> 11433.56]  Linus, how do you feel about Samsung selling the Folds phone with known factory defaults?
[11433.56 --> 11434.56]  Defects.
[11435.12 --> 11438.64]  Then refusing to repair them without people sending their phone in with no timeline.
[11438.96 --> 11440.80]  Well, if that's happening, that sucks.
[11441.00 --> 11443.20]  This is the first time hearing of it, though.
[11446.40 --> 11447.42]  Hi, LLD.
[11447.62 --> 11452.58]  I work at a small prototype machine shop that currently tracks everything on paper because
[11452.58 --> 11456.88]  we haven't found a software that allows different processes for each item.
[11457.28 --> 11458.80]  Any suggestions or leads?
[11461.98 --> 11466.08]  Honestly, you're treading into the territory of needing to make your own.
[11466.76 --> 11467.88]  Yeah, that sucks.
[11467.88 --> 11472.16]  I mean, yeah, we're using Sniper.
[11472.16 --> 11473.54]  You track it on paper?
[11475.86 --> 11478.84]  Is this something you could just use like Google Sheets for?
[11479.60 --> 11480.26]  I don't know.
[11480.64 --> 11482.54]  I mean, Google Sheets is pretty powerful.
[11483.16 --> 11485.16]  And if it's able to be done on paper?
[11487.84 --> 11488.16]  Oh, yeah.
[11488.24 --> 11489.22]  Anything you can do on paper.
[11489.34 --> 11489.86]  You can do it in Excel.
[11489.86 --> 11490.58]  You can do it in Sheets.
[11490.68 --> 11491.24]  Yeah, exactly.
[11491.64 --> 11491.66]  Or Sheets.
[11491.66 --> 11497.22]  I feel like I would try Sheets.
[11497.40 --> 11500.58]  I think outside of that, you're going to get into the realm of needing to make it yourself.
[11500.78 --> 11502.80]  But you can do quite a bit with Sheets.
[11503.08 --> 11508.90]  And like Dan just said, if you're able to do it on paper, it should translate pretty well.
[11509.06 --> 11509.16]  Yeah.
[11511.24 --> 11514.78]  Paper's limitation works perfectly for anything like that.
[11514.78 --> 11515.18]  Yeah.
[11515.18 --> 11522.30]  Hey, LLD, heard you talk about YouTube mobile ad space changes.
[11522.82 --> 11527.20]  I noticed today that my mobile ads were plainly labeled sponsored.
[11527.44 --> 11530.76]  As a creator, what are your thoughts on YouTube changing the phrasing?
[11533.12 --> 11533.34]  Hmm.
[11535.28 --> 11537.36]  Mobile ads are very plainly labeled sponsored.
[11537.60 --> 11540.06]  I mean, yeah.
[11540.86 --> 11544.48]  Obvious labeling of sponsored content is good.
[11545.18 --> 11547.02]  I mean, sure.
[11547.10 --> 11550.96]  As a creator, maybe I could make more if it was not clearly labeled.
[11551.12 --> 11562.12]  But we have always striven, strived to clearly disclose sponsored content.
[11562.60 --> 11565.46]  And I am fully supportive of that.
[11569.22 --> 11573.82]  I find it hard holding the 40-ounce bottle in the car, not wide enough cup holders.
[11573.82 --> 11579.56]  I was wondering if you had any suggestions to perch or latch the bottle inside of holding
[11579.56 --> 11580.30]  it up in my lap.
[11580.60 --> 11580.94]  Instead of.
[11581.14 --> 11583.86]  Instead of holding it in my lap like a noob.
[11584.34 --> 11585.16]  This is for Luke.
[11585.22 --> 11586.88]  I don't use the 40-ounce day-to-day.
[11587.78 --> 11588.58]  40-ounce bottle.
[11588.88 --> 11589.84]  What to do with it in the car?
[11590.00 --> 11590.52]  No cup holders.
[11590.64 --> 11591.10]  Isn't this?
[11591.68 --> 11592.92]  That's, no, that's, oh, wait.
[11593.80 --> 11594.58]  I think that's a 20.
[11594.92 --> 11595.18]  Wait.
[11595.26 --> 11595.64]  Oh, no.
[11595.74 --> 11596.12]  Oh, sorry.
[11596.20 --> 11596.50]  The 60.
[11596.58 --> 11597.58]  Oh, oh, the 40-ounce.
[11597.60 --> 11599.52]  The 40-ounce is the middle one, I think.
[11599.66 --> 11601.44]  No, I have no, oh, shoot.
[11601.54 --> 11603.60]  I curated this because I thought we were talking about the 64.
[11603.78 --> 11604.76]  I totally spaced on it.
[11604.94 --> 11609.28]  And we have a new, like, sleeve coming that has a thing that maybe you could hang off of
[11609.28 --> 11609.58]  something.
[11609.88 --> 11611.56]  For the 40, no, I have nothing.
[11611.92 --> 11615.52]  I had, that's, that's one of the reasons that I daily the 21-ounce or 22 or whatever
[11615.52 --> 11617.64]  this is, because it fits in my cup holders.
[11618.10 --> 11621.86]  There are some 3D printable cup holder adapters I've seen online.
[11622.36 --> 11622.76]  Hey.
[11622.76 --> 11625.68]  Because I daily the 40 and it fits in nothing.
[11625.94 --> 11626.50]  That's cool.
[11626.50 --> 11630.26]  But I, I, most of the time if I'm driving, I'm driving to work.
[11630.34 --> 11633.92]  So I'll have my lunch bag and my 64-ounce water bottle.
[11634.10 --> 11637.46]  And I just put my lunch bag on the right side of my passenger seat.
[11637.54 --> 11641.36]  And I put the 64-ounce water bottle on the left side of my passenger seat.
[11641.38 --> 11642.16]  And it never moves.
[11642.32 --> 11643.32]  It just sits right there.
[11643.56 --> 11645.58]  Because the lunch bag is there to keep it in spot.
[11646.04 --> 11647.28]  So it's never been a problem for me.
[11647.50 --> 11651.42]  I have no illusions of a 64-ounce fitting in a cup holder.
[11651.42 --> 11654.40]  That would actually be hilarious.
[11654.84 --> 11659.52]  But I'm pretty sure there's a 3D printer adapter for that.
[11660.04 --> 11661.28]  Someone will find a way.
[11661.38 --> 11666.34]  The nice thing about our bottles being popular is that you can search LTT water bottle on
[11666.34 --> 11668.76]  like Thingiverse or whatever the new ones are.
[11669.14 --> 11671.40]  And they'll pop up with lots of interesting stuff.
[11671.40 --> 11673.18]  I'm at a curated.
[11673.74 --> 11675.72]  You got some potentials and some incoming letters.
[11675.84 --> 11675.92]  Yeah.
[11675.98 --> 11678.08]  I wanted to mention from one of the potentials.
[11678.50 --> 11682.08]  For Benjamin's, can you just forward this to the Creator Warehouse team?
[11682.62 --> 11688.38]  Benjamin asks, is there a reason why the internal magnet polarity for the stubby is different
[11688.38 --> 11690.10]  compared to the full-size driver?
[11690.76 --> 11695.44]  The magnetic bit sticks to the full-size driver's internal magnet and is repelled by the stubbies,
[11695.68 --> 11698.14]  which doesn't prevent you from installing it.
[11698.14 --> 11701.24]  Like the ones that came with them or whatever, I believe.
[11701.44 --> 11705.66]  But can you just find out if that was intentional or if it's just random or what the dealio is with that?
[11707.38 --> 11707.74]  Please?
[11709.14 --> 11714.48]  Hey guys, supposed to be running a concert right now, but instead I'm shopping for some quality cable ties.
[11714.72 --> 11716.96]  Just picked up an old Steam Link from a pawn shop today.
[11717.20 --> 11717.94]  What do you guys think of them?
[11718.42 --> 11719.80]  Oh, Steam Link was so cool.
[11719.80 --> 11728.52]  What a neat concept that I was not sad enough when Valve discontinued it.
[11728.56 --> 11735.48]  For those of you who don't remember, the Steam Link is a little thin client that's intended to be a streaming box
[11735.48 --> 11743.78]  that connects to your Steam gaming PC and allows you to play games from your PC anywhere else on the same local network.
[11743.78 --> 11749.12]  So you would hook it up to your TV and then either via Wi-Fi or ideally over Ethernet,
[11749.26 --> 11756.98]  you would stream games that your GPU encodes and you would play them on your TV with a controller that is connected through the Steam Link.
[11758.94 --> 11759.80]  So cool.
[11760.28 --> 11763.16]  Such an inexpensive, elegant solution.
[11763.16 --> 11768.08]  And honestly, something that just hasn't really been replaced.
[11769.08 --> 11773.84]  Commodity Android boxes are full of malware and danger.
[11774.62 --> 11778.44]  And building a full PC for that is power inefficient and costly.
[11779.82 --> 11785.74]  They were super cool and I kind of wish I still had mine.
[11790.38 --> 11792.14]  Sorry, I was typing a message.
[11792.14 --> 11793.06]  You got any more curated?
[11793.16 --> 11793.50]  Yeah, we do.
[11794.02 --> 11797.80]  Luke, if floatplanes sank initially, do you think you would still work at LMG?
[11799.64 --> 11800.90]  I don't know if he would have let me.
[11803.22 --> 11804.98]  How do I say this nicely?
[11805.14 --> 11806.14]  I love Luke.
[11807.08 --> 11809.98]  I will say a lot of the things that we fought about back then ended up being right about.
[11809.98 --> 11810.72]  So get rekt.
[11811.06 --> 11813.24]  A lot of things I was also right about.
[11813.52 --> 11813.68]  Yeah.
[11814.70 --> 11815.26]  Very good.
[11815.58 --> 11815.98]  Very good.
[11816.10 --> 11816.40]  Very good.
[11816.54 --> 11816.80]  Very good.
[11817.36 --> 11820.98]  I think that would have been like the goal.
[11820.98 --> 11821.58]  Goal.
[11821.80 --> 11823.34]  Both of us were fighting for that.
[11823.62 --> 11823.82]  Yeah.
[11823.90 --> 11830.48]  In our own ways that somehow we were lucky and hardworking enough to both succeed at.
[11830.74 --> 11832.52]  Is that an okay way of putting it?
[11832.62 --> 11832.82]  Yeah.
[11833.18 --> 11834.60]  It was a rocky time.
[11834.68 --> 11836.68]  So it kind of would have depended on when it failed.
[11836.78 --> 11839.14]  And I think in a lot of ways, how.
[11839.14 --> 11843.84]  And I don't know if my role would have been the same or any of that kind of stuff, but
[11843.84 --> 11846.68]  I think we would have liked to try to find a way to make it work.
[11846.84 --> 11848.70]  I just don't know how to be signed if it would have been guaranteed.
[11849.38 --> 11853.10]  I got a response from Sebastian about the magnet polarity.
[11853.96 --> 11854.96]  It's random.
[11855.12 --> 11855.96]  It's not controlled for.
[11857.56 --> 11858.00]  Got it.
[11858.08 --> 11858.26]  Okay.
[11858.30 --> 11858.86]  Well, that's why.
[11861.80 --> 11862.70]  Thank you, Sebastian.
[11862.70 --> 11863.70]  Yeah.
[11869.70 --> 11872.02]  Anything else here that you guys want to talk about?
[11872.40 --> 11874.70]  I'm trying to plow through incomings really quick.
[11874.92 --> 11875.28]  Yeah.
[11875.38 --> 11877.60]  How are there so many merch messages today?
[11877.72 --> 11880.02]  This is a $600 backpack, you guys.
[11880.88 --> 11882.72]  I think it's the bread plushie.
[11883.52 --> 11883.86]  Oh.
[11884.14 --> 11884.38]  Yeah.
[11884.84 --> 11885.54]  Well, okay.
[11885.62 --> 11886.38]  There's your problem.
[11886.84 --> 11887.88]  What the heck?
[11887.88 --> 11891.86]  You know, we make real serious products here.
[11892.10 --> 11894.84]  Have you seen the description of the bread plushie?
[11894.84 --> 11896.00]  Yes, I've seen the description.
[11896.26 --> 11897.82]  When you have the site set to French?
[11898.12 --> 11898.56]  No.
[11899.24 --> 11900.26]  Have you seen it?
[11900.32 --> 11900.90]  Oh, yeah.
[11901.52 --> 11904.52]  Think about the translation of, you know how it just says bread a million times?
[11904.90 --> 11905.80]  Think about the translation.
[11908.24 --> 11909.46]  It's so good.
[11909.46 --> 11911.38]  That's the Linus version of the site.
[11911.74 --> 11914.08]  It just says for people that don't understand.
[11914.22 --> 11915.84]  It just says pain over and over.
[11915.84 --> 11917.46]  Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain.
[11917.46 --> 11917.68]  Uh-huh.
[11917.94 --> 11918.34]  Okay.
[11918.48 --> 11919.42]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11919.72 --> 11922.56]  If you read it with an English accent, it's pain.
[11923.70 --> 11929.62]  It's just a whole thing of just pain, pain, pain, pain, pain.
[11932.32 --> 11933.20]  Oh, man.
[11933.22 --> 11934.06]  It's so funny.
[11934.50 --> 11934.82]  All right.
[11934.84 --> 11937.42]  We got one last one from Anna M.
[11937.42 --> 11943.52]  I provided mostly positive feedback about this bra with only one downside, and your customer
[11943.52 --> 11945.34]  service gave me a $10 in-store credit.
[11945.34 --> 11949.60]  I just want to say how comfortable this bra is for men shopping for SOs.
[11950.30 --> 11958.14]  So, Anna picked up the Women's Scoop Bralette, and then the Women's Boy Short, and a sticker
[11958.14 --> 11958.38]  pack.
[11958.62 --> 11958.94]  All right.
[11959.02 --> 11959.42]  Heck, yeah.
[11959.50 --> 11963.66]  Love to see people back after a positive experience.
[11963.96 --> 11964.46]  That's great.
[11965.66 --> 11966.12]  Okay.
[11966.64 --> 11967.96]  Hey, good luck, Steven.
[11968.40 --> 11970.46]  Having a new kid is always stressful.
[11970.94 --> 11971.22]  Yeah.
[11971.40 --> 11971.86]  And awesome.
[11972.24 --> 11973.94]  And we'll see you again next week.
[11974.24 --> 11975.62]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[11975.90 --> 11976.30]  Bye!

[11994.20 --> 11994.86]  Bye!
[11994.86 --> 11995.00]  Bye!
[11995.00 --> 11996.00]  Bye!
[11996.00 --> 11996.20]  Bye!
