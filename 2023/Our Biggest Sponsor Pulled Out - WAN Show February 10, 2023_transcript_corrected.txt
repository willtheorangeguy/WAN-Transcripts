[0.00 → 10.32] What is up everyone welcome to the WAN Show we've got a great show lined up for you guys today
[10.32 → 16.92] well we're going to make it great we've got a few topics first of all begun the chatbot wars have
[16.92 → 25.68] yeah oh whoa this is hilarious okay so from the WAN Show writer I have logged into Bing on your
[25.68 → 31.14] computers feel free to access it and ask a few discussion questions slash make a few searches
[31.14 → 39.12] and what's great is that if it's good I win a thousand dollars from popular streamer QC if
[39.12 → 43.44] it's good yeah who whose collab I will be talking about a little bit on the show that's one of our
[43.44 → 50.46] topics for today what else we got today okay yeah that's right I took the only interesting one
[50.46 → 58.74] uh Samsung says shut up about our garbage filled phones don't talk about it okay, and we have one
[58.74 → 66.24] because we're gonna look into it also uh LDT merch spotted in the wild uh that topic is actually
[66.24 → 71.94] hilarious I don't want to spoil it though should, I spoil it you should spoil it yeah uh so apparently
[71.94 → 80.64] uh a a went home with somebody in order to do the business and that person that they went
[80.64 → 86.04] home with happened to be wearing Linus Tech Tips underwear, and they posted on I don't know what
[86.04 → 91.94] this is uh Reddit is it Reddit I'm not sure if I don't know you know what we'll get into it more later
[91.94 → 96.94] Facebook or something, and they said for now help for now here's the thing what why are you guys
[96.94 → 102.76] thinking about it okay you take someone home what would you do they're wearing LTT underwear what
[102.76 → 103.66] would you do yeah
[103.66 → 110.86] so
[110.86 → 124.86] so
[124.86 → 131.88] this video is brought to you today by Thrum the Ridge and Squarespace I want to make a slight edit
[131.88 → 136.72] to that question because I think asking our audience what they would do if they went home
[136.72 → 140.08] with someone that happened to be wearing LTT no that's what I want to know okay that's what I want
[140.08 → 145.78] to know I just want nothing but positivity it's been a long week Luke fair enough let me tell you
[145.78 → 150.56] something screw it I'm not going to put in my question I had three days this week when I didn't go to work
[150.56 → 156.64] but they were the hardest that I've worked in the last six months because I took three kids to
[156.64 → 163.28] Disneyland and fixed XQC's computer on uh like three day total round trip turnaround okay
[163.28 → 172.58] it was very challenging many steps were walked okay and the computer was fixed uh why don't we jump
[172.58 → 177.62] right into our first topic what the devil is the headline topic I forget what the title of the stream is
[177.62 → 184.86] even uh sponsor sponsor bailed our sponsor bailed yeah isn't that the headline our sponsor
[184.86 → 185.36] bailed
[185.36 → 195.26] oh that's right one of our one of our biggest sponsors for the last two years bailed on their
[195.26 → 201.76] the biggest project it was his idea for the title no I forgot between telling you that and us
[201.76 → 209.10] talking now you did film like two videos other videos I'm sorry I'm trying okay fair enough okay
[209.10 → 217.46] Intel extreme tech upgrade is over it's done finite yeah kaput yeah done yep you're never getting
[217.46 → 222.36] one never I mean I don't think you were eligible anyway as like top management but like well Ed got
[222.36 → 228.22] one Ed got yeah how the hell did Ed get one yeah so I think I technically that's not fair than
[228.22 → 231.56] yeah so maybe you're ineligible because you work for a different company I don't know I'll find
[231.56 → 235.62] some way to make it you get computers anyway you don't need one I actually don't yeah forget it
[235.62 → 244.74] forget it the point is Intel extreme tech upgrade is over we did 24 episodes which hilariously at the
[244.74 → 250.94] time that we booked Intel extreme tech upgrade two years ago I was like yeah we're totally going to make
[250.94 → 257.86] our way through like everyone in the company but the rate at which our employee count has grown
[257.86 → 263.66] been hiring more people that has been outpaced how fast we can make these videos there are a ton of
[263.66 → 268.54] work right because you got to do all the procurement everyone's kind of this is their chance to like
[268.54 → 274.46] talk to you guys right, so everyone's looking for not a gimmick something that expresses who they are
[274.46 → 279.04] but a unique element right this is yeah yeah until in the early ones it was pretty simple I'm going to be a
[279.04 → 285.28] game streamer gaming right now it's gotten a little bit more complicated it's like oh I'm going to make a
[285.28 → 291.74] little bit more interesting exactly right yeah, but now it's its done it's done what is this guess how
[291.74 → 298.52] many views' oh we did 24 episodes of them guess how many views across all episodes you can't look before
[298.52 → 304.66] reading this guess then scroll to the readout super chat end of show section Colton now I know
[304.66 → 313.08] Intel extreme tech upgrade was a massive performer for us, it was honestly probably the best idea that I have ever
[313.08 → 319.44] had in the entire history of this company I think outside potentially scrapyard wars I think I've
[319.44 → 325.32] seen people call it out as an individual piece of content that we do more than anything it's what I
[325.32 → 333.06] call a win win-win win yeah absolutely everybody wins yeah the sponsor wins because particularly at the
[333.06 → 339.48] time they booked it Intel didn't have a lot of good to talk about there wasn't a lot of positive sentiment and
[339.48 → 344.16] with my like calling out the name of the reason why I brought that up is actually because
[344.16 → 349.92] they would always say Intel extreme rig update they wouldn't just say like rig update or extreme rig
[349.92 → 354.90] update Intel was at the beginning of the call-out every single time do you know when I named the series
[354.90 → 362.72] when I was standing on the stairs to Anthony's place for the first episode it had a completely
[362.72 → 369.96] different name, and I was like not stupid um just brand it we're going to call it extreme tech upgrade because it's like
[369.96 → 376.40] ITU oh which is their overclocking software yeah yeah I was like he he he that'll be funny okay let's go with that uh and if they
[376.40 → 381.14] don't like it there's always gotta be we'll dub something minuses always with his little acronyms they always mean
[381.14 → 385.80] something there's always something the fastest possible doesn't mean anything no right over on tech
[385.80 → 395.12] yeah that doesn't mean anything no anywho uh so we came up with extreme tech upgrade, and it's a win win-win win
[395.12 → 403.28] okay so the uh who was it first so the sponsor wins because it's just all good vibes there's nothing
[403.28 → 411.10] but good vibes it's its your tech in good vibes how can you go wrong yeah okay we win because we get
[411.10 → 417.30] sponsored it's sponsored content which you guys probably understand pays way better than normal
[417.30 → 423.04] content oh yeah right but then here's the thing if you can find sponsored content that the audience
[423.04 → 429.66] loves the audience wins because they get a chance in content that otherwise wouldn't exist right to get
[429.66 → 434.30] to know all the different members of the team and see all these different approaches I mean it has been
[434.30 → 440.92] just wild how many messages I get with people talking about how like inspiring extreme
[440.92 → 447.04] tech upgrade was for people's setups right it's so cool that makes sense and I learned this kind of
[447.04 → 453.24] by accident but what the amount you learn about someone from how they would spend five thousand
[453.24 → 461.96] dollars yeah is unbelievable yeah like okay seriously I would strongly recommend this if you happen to
[461.96 → 468.36] just be like a casual high net worth individual okay first date just give them five thousand dollars to
[468.36 → 472.74] spend and watch them okay I bet you'll know if you want to spend the rest of your life with them
[472.74 → 481.86] there you go no comment on that at all yeah that wouldn't be weird right wow and then the fourth win
[481.86 → 487.50] you're really setting yourself up for some fascinating expectations first if you can
[487.50 → 492.58] afford that at all, but you're also communicating that you can easily afford this, so I hope you're like
[492.58 → 501.34] and the fourth win is the staff it's like it's like sponsored content that also turns into people
[501.34 → 507.62] having sick setups at home yeah Linus found a way to flex some Mr. beastie stuff but he
[507.62 → 514.26] doesn't have to pay for it it's its the best it's the best deal I have ever negotiated they're
[514.26 → 519.34] also genuinely really fun to watch yeah well that's what I said that's the win for the audience great
[519.34 → 525.94] Jake's entire video I've watched Dennis's twice yeah it's just hilarious I think I've seen most of
[525.94 → 531.04] them at this point, and I'll pretty much every single one that I have clicked on I've watched the whole
[531.04 → 535.34] way through because it's actually like consistently pretty interesting because you'll find whatever
[535.34 → 540.50] you'll roast them for taking whatever from the office which is that's another thing what they steal
[540.50 → 547.18] from the office is almost like a lot of people yeah the whole thing is just like I don't know do they go for
[547.18 → 552.10] stuff they think I won't notice do they just go for the obvious stuff do they just go straight for
[552.10 → 560.50] the high value I don't know how long has it been there how long if they had it yeah exactly yeah I don't
[560.50 → 570.86] know but guess what Linus Media Group Incorporated happens to be a production juggernaut and as such we
[570.86 → 577.22] were not going to simply allow a great thing like Intel Extreme Tech upgrade to die simply because
[577.22 → 582.92] Intel I mean you know what the reality of it is we love working with Intel we've been working with
[582.92 → 587.00] them as long as we've existed almost do you remember the first time we worked with Intel it was like
[587.00 → 591.38] three months in yeah was it one of those like commercial things that we did yep it was like
[591.38 → 597.86] promoting like a snowboard promo that they were doing with like 4770 K or something yeah that or yeah
[597.86 → 602.86] 6700 K, or it must have been 47 I don't know it was a long time ago definitely not 67 yeah it must
[602.86 → 607.94] have been 4770 K you got like a free snowboard or something might have even been Ivy Bridge holy crap
[607.94 → 614.98] might have been 3,000 anyway the point is that we did like these little in video like pre-roll things
[614.98 → 621.46] massive shout out to Mike you know who you are who got that whole thing kickstarted on Intel side
[621.46 → 627.14] because they had zero awareness at that time like influencer YouTube what like yeah like nothing
[627.14 → 632.98] they would go, and they would blow six seven figures on all kinds of wild stuff that as far as I could
[632.98 → 638.58] tell had essentially zero impact, and then you know when I wanted like 500 bucks they'd be like sorry
[638.58 → 643.72] who are you I'm like I don't know only like one of the biggest tech YouTubers which I guess doesn't
[643.72 → 649.72] matter right now but could someday I believed Luke actually I didn't really believe much at that
[649.72 → 654.84] point I was just trying we believed a little bit we wanted a little bit of we wanted to believe it
[654.84 → 655.56] there was hope
[655.56 → 662.20] oh that was pretty much all we had to go on yeah um anyway so we've been working with Intel almost as
[662.20 → 667.40] long as we've existed, and you know like any relationship that lasts for 10 years things
[667.40 → 671.48] add, and they flow you know how things go, and we're still going to be working with them
[671.48 → 676.36] but you know whether it was changing priorities over there whether they dropped the ball whether
[676.36 → 680.28] well no we didn't drop the ball we followed up we gave them time but whatever happened over there
[680.28 → 689.00] they couldn't make it happen and if you had to guess if you had to guess what company would find it
[689.00 → 696.68] pretty hilarious to kick Intel while they're down and scoop extreme tech upgrade out from under them
[696.68 → 705.88] who would it be arm kidding other three you've got one letter right actually you've got
[705.88 → 713.64] two letters right yeah AMD let's go I think yeah the whole chat already guessed yeah AMD is coming
[713.64 → 720.20] it's not going to be called the same thing because that wouldn't be as funny um, but streams like
[720.20 → 725.96] part of their branding and like yeah yeah yeah so it's going to be called AMD ultimate tech upgrade
[725.96 → 730.76] ought to I had nothing to do with the naming this time I take no responsibility for that
[730.76 → 739.08] the first episode will be with Adam oh really okay the first episode is going to be with Adam from the
[739.08 → 745.56] writing team and then my understanding is that there's going to be a very special second episode
[745.56 → 753.16] that is going to have none other than Yvonne as the subject now because she is my wife um I'm not
[753.16 → 759.08] how are you going to tell me I can't get one I'm not privy and Yvonne gets so I can explain this
[759.08 → 764.76] I can explain this uh this was a business decision this was a strategic decision made not by me
[765.40 → 769.72] this was actually made by the business team because they really want to put a strong foot forward with
[769.72 → 778.60] these first couple and then lock down a longer term deal here because full disclosure guys when you renegotiate
[778.60 → 782.44] um uh a content deal you never do it at the old price
[785.00 → 789.88] so it's not cheaper I can tell you guys that much look okay I got a lab to build
[792.20 → 797.16] I got a lab to build okay, and I think that people are asking is it the same budget
[797.16 → 801.32] I actually don't know the details someone suggested a budget of six thousand nine hundred dollars
[802.60 → 806.60] it's pretty good okay done six thousand nine hundred dollars Canadian
[808.68 → 814.20] brilliant six thousand nine hundred dollars Canadian done yeah I think I'm actually getting
[814.20 → 824.84] a discount was it USD before yeah oh wow five thousand yeah so it's going to be awesome I'm really
[824.84 → 829.48] looking forward to it, I have no idea what's coming which is half the fun for me in the early ones I
[829.48 → 836.04] was actually quite involved I mean not people like Anthony like I didn't need me to help him right but a
[836.04 → 841.08] lot of the early ones I was quite involved ahead of time and sort of part selection and stuff like that
[841.08 → 845.40] and then over time uh procurement started to help the rest of the writing team started to do a lot more
[845.40 → 850.84] of it I think I was only really involved in the first like couple um and now I kind of just walk in
[850.84 → 856.52] I'm like what's going on here yeah what's uh what's shake a lake and let's zap strap some speakers
[856.52 → 864.52] so this random stand I found for you okay that worked I wasn't actually flaming it
[864.52 → 871.64] you need to be there by the way when we finally do the episode reacting to Linus's old setups' oh yeah
[871.64 → 878.04] have I shown you any of them like have you ever seen a bunch of them have you like well no I mean
[878.04 → 883.56] from before you knew me like 12 years yeah, but I did most of my Jacky stuff before you met me
[884.44 → 889.24] okay, but I've seen the the'm trying to go from every the green water cooling one that had the
[889.24 → 894.12] purple coil around it okay yeah I've seen that one I've seen the chiller okay I definitely haven't
[894.12 → 897.64] seen all of them, but I've seen some of them is what I'm trying to say you show me some pictures
[898.52 → 903.32] I've done some weird stuff um I'm trying to I'm trying to find something now, but you know that at one
[903.32 → 908.60] point in time um I had transferred my components over to a new case and the power button on the
[908.60 → 915.64] case didn't work so uh my motherboard at the time had a power button on the motherboard, so I rigged up
[915.64 → 922.68] an elastic band and pencil set up so that the the side panel of the case I got a hole in it
[922.68 → 927.08] and I had the pencil mounted in the hole and the elastic bands would hold it in place and you just
[927.08 → 931.00] press the eraser on the pencil and the pencil would go through and press the power button on the
[931.00 → 933.96] motherboard and that would be how you turn the computer on it was sick
[936.20 → 943.08] okay I will see your eraser rubber band and raise you one surround speaker stand
[946.92 → 951.64] that's amazing yes that is a wheel is that a brush wheel that is a wheel at the bottom oh that's just
[951.64 → 958.36] a wheel it's a wheel beautiful yeah the base is a wheel that was the inspiration for Jake's surround
[958.36 → 965.24] speaker mount was my setup from when I was about 15. That's amazing so we're gonna I'm going to dig
[965.24 → 970.92] through all my old pictures I'm going to like pull out all the weird Jacky stuff that I've done over
[970.92 → 976.92] the years, and we're going to do like uh like a mean obviously I can't react to it this all seems
[976.92 → 983.64] perfectly reasonable to me, but I feel like you guys are probably going to have some well we'll see I do
[983.64 → 987.96] feel like I should be involved with that, but I feel like I'm going to agree with your decisions more because
[987.96 → 994.76] you remember like I mounted a water pump on a cut-off piece of the old mud flap of my old car
[994.76 → 1002.28] like do you remember that hmm like I've done that right now there's a graphics card laying on flat on
[1002.28 → 1008.92] top of my computer with a PCI riser cable coming out of the main component or main area of my computer
[1008.92 → 1015.32] going out all the way up connecting into the graphics card with a second power supply not in the computer
[1015.32 → 1019.48] on the outside of the computer running power cables up the back of the computer into the
[1019.48 → 1025.32] graphics card so that everything works because otherwise it wouldn't have fit I enjoy the bank
[1025.32 → 1028.92] okay that's I did not adopt the bank I was born in the bank
[1031.80 → 1038.04] that's another hilarious one to me the amount of flack that I take people accusing me of being a fan
[1038.04 → 1045.80] of this or a fan of that particularly accusing me of being extremely anti-aids like I hate
[1045.80 → 1052.12] AMD for some reason started with AMD system this was my desktop wallpaper for I kid you not years
[1053.00 → 1059.96] I literally ripped AMD on my desktop wallpaper this is super sick wallpaper I forget where I got it but
[1059.96 → 1067.80] apparently I still have it somewhere um for actual years so when I say AMD's product is bad
[1068.52 → 1071.32] it's just because it's bad it's its not
[1073.72 → 1080.60] fortunately they're not bad these days so AMD ultimate tech upgrade is going to be a ton of fun
[1080.60 → 1085.88] uh we're going to build some sick gaming rigs and uh I mean maybe some other things
[1085.88 → 1091.24] so there it is guys oh right my computer's all red right now it's all AMD yeah mine too yep
[1092.36 → 1096.92] actually yeah I mean I've been thread ripper for a while, but you were intel before I was
[1096.92 → 1104.04] yep but then not now I mean for what I'm assuming is like a year and a half now yeah I've been AMD
[1104.04 → 1109.48] processor it's fine it's been great it's been great um I mean I do have some problems with like
[1109.48 → 1115.16] sleep states but like realistically that can happen on team blue as well yeah, so I'm not gonna I'm not
[1115.16 → 1122.12] going to make too much fuss about that uh but because I had to uh because I had to clear my CMOS for
[1122.12 → 1131.48] just like as a troubleshooting step for the AMD um 30-day challenge I am bunged up my NVMe raid
[1131.48 → 1140.76] settings so that was terrifying and b I ended up um losing that setting that I had had to change to
[1140.76 → 1145.24] make it so that my system doesn't just randomly crash all the time, so there's like uh there's an
[1145.24 → 1150.12] s3 sleep bug or something like that I have to disable all power saving states otherwise my computer
[1150.12 → 1155.56] not when it's working when it's idle will just crash like randomly crashed hard lock full
[1155.56 → 1161.40] lock it's very annoying it's a thread ripper bug and AMD has completely abandoned enthusiast thread
[1161.40 → 1167.80] ripper even though they said they definitely wouldn't go to show goes to show you I um
[1167.80 → 1173.00] I have no problem calling out sponsors even new ones who've just signed a big deal with us uh okay
[1173.00 → 1179.80] so try to guess intel extreme tech upgrade is over 24 episodes total views yeah so
[1181.24 → 1185.72] man I have not paid attention to views on these, so I'm coming in extremely uneducated
[1186.52 → 1192.76] but I'm going to throw my guess this I feel like this might be high I'm going to throw my guess at 50 though
[1192.76 → 1196.92] because I feel like some performed like really, really well Dennis's has like six million or something
[1196.92 → 1200.68] yeah some of them just like smashed it out of the park, but I have to assume some of the other
[1200.68 → 1206.84] ones didn't do as well I'm going to say 70 because almost across the board they have at least two
[1206.84 → 1210.28] million views oh they're just killing so that's 48 yeah I haven't even looked and then there's a
[1210.28 → 1215.56] handful like I think Riley's has four or five million Anthony's has at least three Riley's was
[1215.56 → 1220.92] good Riley's was great Anthony's was good so many of these were so good yeah I'm just remembering them
[1220.92 → 1226.12] because it's been a long time it's been two years yeah so like I can't remember them all off the top of my head but
[1226.12 → 1233.88] literally I think the biggest W that I have ever W'd um and this is one that I know for sure was
[1233.88 → 1240.44] actually my idea I was genuinely stunned to the point where I thought I was being trolled
[1241.24 → 1247.96] when I was first informed that they were that we were like they were not renewing um
[1247.96 → 1256.52] and yeah I don't know oh wow uh I haven't looked at views for these in a while I think we're both
[1256.52 → 1264.60] going to be way short Sarah's is 4.7 million Dennis's is at nine Davids is at six
[1266.28 → 1270.84] um I actually don't think I've watched one that I didn't think was just fantastic so like yeah
[1270.84 → 1278.84] loops is 2.4 Alex's is 5.7 Brandon's at three Chase's did 4.2 it's a great thumbnail though this is
[1278.84 → 1286.60] a is a fantastic thumbnail look at his computer freaking guy love it Andy I broke his bed
[1286.60 → 1292.04] I mean that's the thing is like that's why reality TV works right like you can't stuff happens you can't
[1292.04 → 1297.72] write life happens yeah you can't write wilder stuff than just what happens when you try and complete a
[1297.72 → 1303.24] project together and especially when people have me do really weird stuff like paint their basement
[1303.24 → 1309.56] right, but that happened in Andy's yeah um all right are we off by like I'm going to try by a lot I
[1309.56 → 1316.60] think we're off by like 88 million, so I was off by like 20 percent yeah yeah I mean you were off by
[1316.60 → 1321.32] more, so I guess I can give myself a little pat on the back for that but like realistically I look at
[1321.32 → 1329.08] analytics infinity percent more than you do these days so the fact that I wasn't closer than you were
[1329.08 → 1334.12] yeah means I might not be doing the greatest job at that yeah they've clearly been killing it
[1334.84 → 1339.80] yeah I'm excited I'm excited to do more the good news is that if the first couple perform well and
[1340.44 → 1344.28] hopefully AMD's not watching this to know that we can stack the deck a little bit because they will
[1344.92 → 1348.92] then we should be signing a long-term deal we should be able to keep these things rolling because
[1348.92 → 1355.24] there's so many people that you guys I haven't gotten to know very well or b haven't even met yet
[1355.24 → 1362.68] there's people who work here that I haven't met, yet that's a weird feeling right it's super weird
[1363.40 → 1369.00] I have no idea how to deal with it like that there 's's people who work here whose only
[1369.00 → 1373.72] interaction with me on a weekly basis is to watch the WAN show, so I was actually just going to bring
[1373.72 → 1379.80] this up I've been work from home for a long time, so this has been happening to me for a while
[1379.80 → 1387.64] right, and I'll walk into the office and walk past groups of people that I've just like never seen
[1387.64 → 1394.92] before, and I'm like oh there was a stretch there after the summer where I think every Monday morning
[1394.92 → 1399.96] meeting we were announcing a new hire new person like new people, and you aren't even in those meetings
[1399.96 → 1405.96] no we're going to have to have name tags like seriously we're going to need uniforms everyone wears the track
[1405.96 → 1412.76] suit okay I'm on board now and name tags yeah Dan's given us Dan's giving us the thumbs up heck yeah
[1412.76 → 1417.32] we're all going to wear the tracksuit okay you guys have got to be wondering about this normally we wait
[1417.32 → 1423.32] a little bit deeper in the show to kind of talk about what's going on LTT store, but I can't contain
[1423.32 → 1431.80] it yes we did it we made a tracksuit why did we make a tracksuit for the only reason anyone makes a
[1431.80 → 1439.00] tracksuit because we can, I have no idea how many tracksuits we're going to sell this was not this was
[1439.00 → 1445.56] not one of those projects that's like well we can calculate the total bill of materials cost and the
[1445.56 → 1451.08] minimum order quantity and profit margins and I think we could figure out if we could make no, no none of
[1451.08 → 1460.52] that happened we were like oh my god we should do a tracksuit, and then we did okay its poly cotton blend
[1460.52 → 1466.20] uh we've got here hold on a second I gotta model it for you guys okay we've got the LTT logo
[1466.20 → 1471.88] on the thigh okay we've got the nice deep pockets zipper pockets okay you don't want your
[1471.88 → 1477.72] stuff falling out zipper pockets are a win gotta love the zipper pockets PKK as always beautiful two
[1477.72 → 1484.68] more zipper pockets on the back zippers right there okay got the accents got the accents on the back okay
[1484.68 → 1492.84] got the uh zipper pockets on the sides here all right uh PKK zipper okay got the
[1492.84 → 1500.36] got the quality okay got the quality you've got your chest pocket too oh yeah I forgot about the chest
[1500.36 → 1505.96] pocket and the chest pocket has a sub pocket that's for like AirPods or wireless headphones or whatever
[1505.96 → 1511.00] else so you got them right there that's actually kind of neat also fits a condom not that I'm saying this
[1511.00 → 1515.40] tracksuit will get you laid you will need one if you not that I'm saying that no we can't say that
[1515.40 → 1518.36] we can't say that, but they know
[1522.68 → 1529.32] yeah we were honestly that is really what happened we were like we should do a tracksuit
[1531.64 → 1538.52] and then we did they were almost tearaways like for how off the hook this merch meeting was okay
[1538.52 → 1545.00] I think it's probably good they weren't tearaways I completely unhinged did you ever have a pair of
[1545.00 → 1550.20] tearaways oh yeah yeah who didn't I was an I was a 90s kid did you actually like think they were
[1551.16 → 1556.52] good no, no one thought they were good yeah okay they were just cool yeah you just had to have them
[1556.52 → 1561.32] yeah yeah yeah no, no no one thought they were practical they were stupid they took forever to put
[1561.32 → 1566.92] back together oh yeah yeah it was ridiculous no, no everybody everybody knew yeah okay
[1566.92 → 1574.44] yeah but like they're sick they're tearaways it's true so every once in a while party trick
[1574.44 → 1580.36] boom pants off it's great can you track that's that don't have the elastic i I like the elastic on the
[1580.36 → 1587.16] ankles oh um for these types of pants yeah I think when we do our joggers and stuff you guys are gonna
[1587.16 → 1592.04] see they're going to have they're going to have elastics down the bottom um for those types of pants I think it
[1592.04 → 1597.72] makes sense I don't like it generally either but like yeah for like running wear and stuff I think
[1597.72 → 1603.00] you want them because if you don't, they just fly all over the place too much by the way probably the
[1603.00 → 1609.40] the best thing to come out of the tracksuit is the photos in general for the tracksuit yeah
[1610.60 → 1616.28] these are actually amazing these are amazing so uh massive shout out to tanner from the writing team
[1616.28 → 1625.00] for being the one who brought in most of our props to kind of complete the ensemble here uh but man we had
[1625.00 → 1626.28] a lot of fun
[1630.04 → 1635.16] that's that's got some uh that's got somewhat what year was that even like 2010 duke nuke energy
[1635.72 → 1639.72] I don't know man, but these are amazing oh my god
[1639.72 → 1649.72] oh my god oh my god Colton money potter right here oh man awesome this is great um
[1650.92 → 1655.56] yeah again shout out tanner absolutely deserves a lot of a lot of the credit for this
[1656.20 → 1664.76] okay got the elastic yeah anyway so you guys can get yours at ltdstore.com I'm going to be completely
[1664.76 → 1670.28] transparent with you all we did not order a ton of these i I think we went pretty much minimum order
[1670.28 → 1677.64] quantity because we're going into this going not expecting yeah yeah I mean I'm always down to be
[1677.64 → 1687.08] surprised right but who knows we could move a thousand today we could move zero today yeah actually
[1687.08 → 1693.40] I'm gonna I'm gonna re-up a question from Jonathan here what do you know I should have asked
[1693.40 → 1697.00] nick about this earlier we had a meeting earlier this week do you know what the status on the tall
[1697.00 → 1703.96] shirts is because you know that one random show where I had to i had to oh right no it was when i
[1703.96 → 1709.08] couldn't talk the Jay and Silent Bob show and I had to be given a random shirt because the colours clashed
[1709.08 → 1715.88] really badly I was given a shirt that wasn't one of ours yeah I don't it's an it's a few different
[1715.88 → 1721.88] companies on the front I don't know what it was for sorry I don't remember but whatever um, but it was in
[1721.88 → 1728.28] tall format yeah and I'm not making any comments about the quality or anything like that but the
[1728.28 → 1735.80] fitment of the length that's the best fitting shirt I have ever had in my life not even remotely close
[1736.52 → 1741.48] and I had there's this thing and people comment on it all the time when I constantly do this because
[1741.48 → 1747.72] I'm constantly pulling my shirts down because I'm like I'm not crazy tall but I'm fairly tall but
[1747.72 → 1754.28] all of my height is in my torso so shirts just they've never fit me properly though the bottom
[1754.28 → 1761.32] of the shirt is like on my waistline lanky boy's coming husky boy's coming very excited about this
[1761.32 → 1766.92] I know that they've taken longer than we wanted them to i I didn't even know I like knew we were
[1766.92 → 1771.72] planning on making a tall shirt I didn't know it was like a thing oh yeah until I wore that shirt
[1771.72 → 1779.16] totally like oh, oh 100 I thought I had just been wearing like and our intention unlike a lot of
[1779.16 → 1787.72] you know custom fits or whatever is that our lanky and our um it's either going to be chunky or thick
[1787.72 → 1791.72] boy or something like that whatever we end up calling the fits I like thick boy, but it might be
[1791.72 → 1795.96] dated they're gonna yeah yeah it could be uh but whatever we end up calling them the pricing will be
[1795.96 → 1801.80] exactly the same as our normal ones we want to make sure that like pricing is just as inclusive
[1801.80 → 1807.88] as the fits that we offer it's just taken a lot longer than we'd like we've had so many projects
[1807.88 → 1812.36] on the go uh you guys are only seeing the tip of the iceberg for what's coming in the next like three
[1812.36 → 1819.00] to six months, but my understanding is that that is absolutely a top priority for Bridget in the next
[1819.00 → 1825.00] little while here awesome very cool i just it made me excited because I knew we were planning on
[1825.00 → 1829.24] releasing those and that's the first time I'd ever worn a shirt that was made for I guess i
[1829.24 → 1834.28] don't know taller torso people I don't know and I was just like wow I don't have to pull it down
[1834.28 → 1840.20] every minute this is amazing yeah I know I don't know it's absolutely something that we're aware of
[1840.20 → 1847.24] um it basically showed up on my radar when we did that um that long sleeve circuit board design shirt
[1847.24 → 1852.28] that I almost killed because I was like these sleeves are ridiculously long, and we sold it saying hey
[1852.28 → 1857.48] look the sleeves are super long and basically every lanky boy in our audience bought it was like
[1857.48 → 1864.68] this is the best shirt I've ever owned and I was like oh yeah oh okay well we can do that uh we just
[1864.68 → 1871.72] we's taken way longer than I would have liked but stuff's hard if you want to do things properly
[1871.72 → 1878.12] yeah it's really tough yeah I totally get it i just it's more like it's not like where are
[1878.12 → 1883.40] they's more like oh I'm my excitement is redoubled basically yeah, and it's especially
[1883.40 → 1889.96] exciting based on just like how well received um our blanks are like the reviews are all like this
[1889.96 → 1895.24] it's like this is great this is great this is great this is great um yeah, but the blank shirts are
[1895.24 → 1901.56] are doing really well i just uh oh uh exciting announcement um our t-shirt printer has apparently
[1901.56 → 1906.28] found a small space to start to shut up in so hopefully we'll start to get some shirts printed which
[1906.28 → 1912.84] would be really great good um I wasn't given any kind of update at any point so I guess this has been
[1912.84 → 1918.52] in in in progress for a while and I'm I'm really excited to start spending some money with our t-shirt
[1918.52 → 1923.64] printer again let's go I got the money I got the money right here I got the shirts right here
[1924.68 → 1930.44] you take money in shirts you send me back shirts with pretty things on them, and then it's going to be good
[1930.44 → 1937.16] everyone's going to win that's what i like i like multi wins yeah everyone wins yeah yeah lots
[1937.16 → 1942.36] of wins nobody needs to lose you know yeah why does it have to be like that we're all gonna
[1942.36 → 1947.64] make it bros yeah right you know why does that why does it have to be like that all right anybody
[1947.64 → 1953.96] get that reference maybe I don't know no I didn't get if it's fine okay sorry uh what do you want to talk
[1953.96 → 1963.08] about next I knew you wouldn't, I was asking the audience to be fair um ouch okay well it's its a
[1963.08 → 1970.28] bit of a bit of a niche reference sick burn um wow okay this might surprise you but the track jacket
[1970.28 → 1978.84] and the track joggers are selling at a near one-to-one ratio that doesn't surprise me I know oh I was
[1978.84 → 1985.72] actually surprised when they were separate items on the store well it's sizing this makes sense if
[1985.72 → 1990.92] people have a tall torso and short legs or vice versa i literally just made the comment yeah it makes
[1990.92 → 1997.56] sense all right this may never have occurred to you but um not everybody has exactly the same proportions
[1999.96 → 2004.52] got them okay yeah um chatbot wars
[2004.52 → 2010.68] uh sure yeah let's talk about it there's a chatbot thing that I'm gonna
[2012.04 → 2015.80] go against, but we can talk about that later lets talk about the general chatbot wars
[2016.52 → 2021.88] um this I have not been as in on because apparently I'm not a cool kid and have not been invited to
[2022.44 → 2027.08] bing search but I guess the company has so we'll be able to mess with it on the show which is cool
[2027.08 → 2035.08] 100 percent um, but there's been a lot going on uh i we talked about ChatGPT and its various antics
[2035.08 → 2041.56] uh quite a bit there and then we kind of let it die down for a little bit, and now it's back things
[2041.56 → 2049.56] are boiling uh Microsoft has released a demo of its new ChatGPT 3.5 plus is what I'm going to call it
[2049.56 → 2056.52] enabled version of bing search as well as a wait list to receive access to the full version
[2057.32 → 2060.68] the wait list is hilarious but I think we're going to get into that in a moment uh part of
[2060.68 → 2066.44] the demo showed a typical search uh typical page of search results but with AI context notes on one
[2066.44 → 2073.56] side can you do a search with the context notes oh uh okay well another mode allows the user
[2073.56 → 2078.28] to talk to the bing chatbot directly what I find kind of interesting in this, and maybe we'll show
[2078.28 → 2087.16] this in a moment um but the AI context notes on the side if you didn't know they were there in
[2087.16 → 2093.40] my opinion are not very noticeable, so this is is this chat or is this search I don't know
[2094.20 → 2104.04] okay just give it a shot ask me anything okay uh why is Hogwarts legacy so uh controversial
[2104.04 → 2113.64] well what what what you guys don't want to be cancelled you don't want to be cancelled
[2113.64 → 2118.20] i just what i just I thought this is America
[2120.36 → 2125.48] sometimes with the topics we cover on the show you would think it is okay all right uh let's jump
[2125.48 → 2132.36] let's jump back jump back jump back okay so yeah this is not this is not a view that I have
[2132.36 → 2140.60] actually personally seen, so this is probably because this account is in and mine at home is not in I have
[2140.60 → 2145.24] not received an invitation okay so Hogwarts legacy is so controversial because it is the first time many
[2145.24 → 2150.76] people have been asked to prove they support trans people, and they have been found wanting I okay to
[2150.76 → 2157.00] be clear I think that um the way the syntax here is a little confusing web that's a web result I'm
[2157.00 → 2164.60] pretty sure the first time many people so it's not the first time anyone has been asked to prove it but
[2164.60 → 2169.16] it's the first time for many people I guess is one way of I think that's just a web result though yeah
[2169.16 → 2174.36] this is okay chat chat chat here we go wait wait wait okay go back don't go to chat go back
[2174.36 → 2179.48] um okay can you full screen it or something's wrong here what's a see more thing
[2180.28 → 2186.04] see more butts see more butts it's welcome to new bing well i I don't know I want to do this one
[2186.04 → 2191.56] yeah so it's its definitely this no it's not what do you keep doing so the thing we're trying to describe
[2191.56 → 2198.44] yeah um let me read it out again to do part of the demo showed is a typical page of search results but
[2198.44 → 2203.64] with AI context notes on one side so normally if you scroll up you see that thing where it says
[2203.64 → 2209.88] trending on bing above there's a box where it has the AI output well let me do this all right
[2209.88 → 2214.04] well we're we're not going to see it that's fine you know what can you just chill
[2214.04 → 2218.52] maybe I'm just wrong can you just relax I'm just gonna look like a douche
[2221.32 → 2226.68] okay wait what changed well I'm not signed in any more oh well that's not good so what's happening
[2226.68 → 2234.04] yeah we can't read that Dan you're holding up a post-it note from like 15 feet you wrote it that's not
[2234.04 → 2239.48] even the side you wrote on you can walk it over I can tell from here you there's no pen on that side of
[2239.48 → 2247.08] the paper I could tell it was on there I just can't read it what's that oh is that a password
[2249.08 → 2256.76] well I don't know the username no I don't know the username is it the same as the email that's on here
[2256.76 → 2262.92] yes okay uh you can figure that out yeah I don't know if I can figure that out you just go to Gmail
[2262.92 → 2268.36] why don't you go to Gmail I could do you want to give me that why don't you both go to Gmail I will
[2269.64 → 2272.92] it's on chrome well I prefer stainless steel
[2276.28 → 2282.60] okay I got this so it's its an at gmail.com account that doesn't make any sense
[2282.60 → 2291.08] that's not the account that makes sense okay then it's not the account click on Linus oh, oh it's
[2291.08 → 2297.64] that one well why would how the devil am I supposed to know it's that account also if I'm
[2297.64 → 2304.52] signed in if I can click the Linus in the top oh well why would I want to use edge okay so I'm
[2304.52 → 2308.44] going to use that as an off-boarding so that while you do that I can keep talking about other things
[2308.44 → 2312.36] I'm going to skip a bunch I don't know if it's somewhere here in the notes I'm going to try to
[2312.36 → 2315.32] find it I'm sure it's somewhere here in the notes but if it's not, i'll just talk off the top of my
[2315.32 → 2321.72] head the wait list is hilarious because not only do you just sign up for the wait list, but they're
[2321.72 → 2326.84] like hey you want to skip the line kind of we'll push you up in the line we're not actually going to
[2326.84 → 2331.96] put you all the way through we'll maybe put you through well you have to set your computer to
[2331.96 → 2338.92] Microsoft defaults for everything as far as I know oh what uh and I think you have to
[2339.48 → 2344.12] do something else let me see if it's in the notes I didn't see it immediately I think it is though
[2344.12 → 2351.40] I'm just not seeing it oh my god um ridiculous wait it's going to take me like four hours to type in
[2351.40 → 2356.36] now because I'm going to make mistakes because I'm trying to talk while I am you able to talk while you
[2356.36 → 2363.08] type notes or type while you sometimes yes sometimes no I think if I'm even like slightly
[2363.08 → 2367.00] off if I'm like a little bit tired or something it's just gone like immediately all right here we
[2367.00 → 2374.12] go Linus laptop um ask anything oh my god join the wait list I thought I'm supposed to have it
[2375.88 → 2379.48] I thought you were too are you sure it's this account Dan
[2379.48 → 2387.32] yes i I don't think this was actually set up by Dan it was not, but this is the account and this is
[2387.32 → 2393.32] the same account that you were logged into on chrome so that doesn't make any sense though oh yeah
[2393.32 → 2397.64] yeah, yeah so someone in float plane chat just bailed me out the other thing is you have to install the
[2397.64 → 2402.68] bing app on your phone what on your phone yeah so you have to you have to set your computer to Microsoft
[2402.68 → 2406.92] defaults, and then they have a QR code thing that you scan with your phone, and you have to install the
[2406.92 → 2412.20] bing app on your phone so you have to do both there's a chat button which is amazing okay hold
[2412.20 → 2416.92] on hold on it's working its working its working oh man welcome to the new bing okay yeah so okay i
[2416.92 → 2422.36] haven't seen I haven't used this here we go here we go it's working okay Hogwarts legacy is a video
[2422.36 → 2427.56] game set our camera is covering it okay uh video game set in the Harry Potter universe, but it has been
[2427.56 → 2434.68] facing controversy due to the transphobic statements made by author J. K. Rowling and the alleged anti-Semitism in
[2434.68 → 2439.40] the game's story oh some people are boycotting the game to show their support for the trans community
[2439.40 → 2445.64] and to protest against Rowling's views I mean that's a good summary seems like a good summary yeah
[2445.64 → 2450.44] based on everything I've seen so far that seems like a pretty solid summary of what people are
[2450.44 → 2455.72] talking about this is interesting it prompts me with extra questions and one of the crazy so okay
[2455.72 → 2459.88] that's interesting I didn't know about that one of the craziest things about this in my opinion yeah
[2459.88 → 2466.12] is this one you can search the web right, and you can even tell it to search the well okay this is
[2466.12 → 2473.64] cool they really want you using chat a two finger swipe gets you from search to chat good yeah
[2473.64 → 2479.80] okay do a normal search I did, and it gave me a chat result can you try to do it again like do
[2479.80 → 2485.48] something different maybe what you don't want to talk about this no are you sure yeah one no I don't two
[2485.48 → 2490.60] i I want to show I want to show the sidebar thing that I was talking about earlier okay all right
[2490.60 → 2493.64] okay because I've gotten it up on my home computer so I know it exists
[2497.08 → 2504.28] what a jerk what happened to Luke cafetière oh did it automatically bring you up yeah it dropped
[2504.28 → 2509.80] chat yeah whoa okay swipe out of this for a second Luke cafetière is a former employee of Linus media
[2509.80 → 2515.72] group a company that produces tech related videos on YouTube he left leg in 2018 to become the coo of
[2515.72 → 2520.68] float plane a video streaming platform that is partly owned by leg he still appears on the wan show a
[2520.68 → 2527.08] weekly podcast hosted by minus Sebastian the founder of leg not me though he also has a twitter and got
[2527.08 → 2531.72] him he also has a Twitter and an Instagram account where he posts about his personal life the least
[2531.72 → 2537.08] accurate part is that last line uh well yeah but okay, okay the last time I posted on Instagram was like
[2537.08 → 2542.76] three years ago but okay but without being like nitpicky it's good it's its very perfect it's
[2542.76 → 2548.44] honestly probably better than you would get from finding a Google search and the context it understood
[2548.44 → 2555.32] the context what happened to him, it's not like he got a haircut yeah it's what people want to know
[2555.32 → 2559.24] yeah what happened to that guy why isn't he on that channel a bunch now he's like almost never there
[2560.60 → 2566.84] that is wildly good and if I asked I'm pretty sure if I asked ChatGPT it will not give you that answer
[2567.80 → 2573.24] because it'll say like because it doesn't search the internet but this one does so this is
[2573.24 → 2579.72] not just ChatGPT into bing I think that's one of the things that most people are missing it is not
[2579.72 → 2586.76] it is in a lot of I don't know if in all ways in a lot of ways it's better oh yeah way better obviously
[2587.56 → 2594.84] access to current information is like mind shatteringly huge yeah like this is absolute
[2594.84 → 2600.12] game changer yeah you know what's really cool I just made a thousand dollars
[2602.92 → 2610.44] because of the QC thing yeah there's no way he can't say it's sick because and okay i I don't know
[2610.44 → 2617.32] who did it whoever made the tweet asking it how many LTT backpacks would fit in a trunk of a tesla
[2617.32 → 2621.56] or whatever the question was oh I didn't see that someone made that tweet on the LTT handle
[2621.56 → 2627.00] oh that's hilarious, and it did it is looked up the dimensions of the Ltd backpack it looked up
[2627.00 → 2631.88] the dimensions of the trunk, and it figured it out how the did it do that ask it let's do it live
[2631.88 → 2637.88] maybe make it different use um use uh uh uh the like the the the banana thing or something the
[2637.88 → 2642.28] Ltd store banana or something I don't know any no i i i i I just want to I just want to see this I just want
[2642.28 → 2648.28] a model show your screen model y oh yeah sorry, sorry okay hold on hold on
[2648.28 → 2655.08] because I thought the dimensions for the backpack are in picture form searching for that
[2655.08 → 2662.84] now it's searching up to be backpack dimensions shut up this is a tricky question man oh my god
[2663.64 → 2670.68] the natural like language of it have different shapes and dimensions based on some rough estimates
[2670.68 → 2677.00] I will try to answer that's insane that's actually nuts
[2681.00 → 2682.12] it's its still going
[2685.64 → 2690.52] will depend on how flexible and compressible the backpacks are and how well they fit into the
[2690.52 → 2698.52] corners and curves of the trunk based on some videos of the model y trunk shut up it can fit about
[2698.52 → 2703.96] five to seven standard care on suitcases which have similar dimensions and capacity holy which is
[2703.96 → 2716.44] accurate that statement is that's crazy I don't know who made that tweet, but that was brilliant
[2716.44 → 2722.28] because I had watched demos I had watched tons of stuff up until that point up until I saw that tweet
[2722.28 → 2729.00] from whoever made that on our team so big social team's amazing shout out Arthur and Arjun
[2729.00 → 2733.16] I didn't realize it was that capable and if we have any people on that team I haven't met yet sorry
[2733.16 → 2739.72] the various steps it had to go through yeah not only did it even showed its work yes it searched the
[2739.72 → 2744.52] original question realized there isn't really an answer for this out there yet decided I'm going to look
[2744.52 → 2748.28] up the dimensions of the backpack I'm going to look up the dimensions of the trunk I'm going to realize
[2748.28 → 2752.44] that this trunk even though I have dimensions and whatnot is going to have weird curves and stuff
[2752.44 → 2756.36] which is going to throw it off quite a bit um I know that's in dimensions don't worry about it, I said
[2756.36 → 2759.96] that poorly, but it's going to have weird curves and stuff that's going to throw it off what can this
[2759.96 → 2765.40] backpack relate to oh a standard size of luggage is extremely similar let's use that because there's
[2765.40 → 2771.24] other references to how that can fit in this blah blah blah blah blah blah blah this was full thought
[2771.24 → 2781.64] process man okay that's crazy okay, okay but how up-to-the-minute is it I like ltdstore.com but i only
[2781.64 → 2790.28] wear tracksuits do they make a tracksuit holy
[2790.28 → 2792.44] fucking
[2805.08 → 2805.64] sh**
[2805.64 → 2807.64] it
[2807.64 → 2814.76] screw you big okay, okay no but seriously though that's crazy that is so crazy they do not seem
[2814.76 → 2824.36] to sell track pants it missed that our track joggers are pants i i I ask it to clarify holy crap hold on a
[2824.36 → 2836.28] second so it suggests me pants to go with the jacket I bought shut up hold on okay that's insane that's crazy
[2844.76 → 2854.12] oh this would be the killer feature to monetize this in a free version this would 100 be black and white
[2854.12 → 2855.32] track pants yeah here we go
[2857.88 → 2858.52] oh man
[2860.68 → 2865.80] is it going to print out the same shopping list that it did earlier or is it just going to list all of
[2865.80 → 2869.72] these in text so am I going to get links to these that's what I'm saying no, no I'm going to get links
[2869.72 → 2873.80] I'm going to get links i get links it's its sites yeah there 's's learn more so they go
[2876.44 → 2877.00] yeah yeah
[2880.20 → 2886.04] wow so if you go back yeah this is wild there's a learn more bar at the bottom
[2886.04 → 2889.56] so it has all the links that are referenced there it is
[2891.64 → 2898.12] you should ask him like are you are you sure like I would get it to re-look at the Ltd
[2898.12 → 2907.40] store for the pants i I really want uh the purchase be from Ltd store whatever uh is there
[2907.40 → 2910.36] another option from them that would work or something like that I don't know I don't want
[2910.36 → 2914.36] to I don't want to lead it too well yeah I'm saying are you sure they don't have matching bottoms
[2914.36 → 2922.36] for the jacket that seems weird track no it really wants to track it wants track pants I'm not sure why
[2922.36 → 2926.28] they don't have it but I couldn't find any on their website the closest they have are pajama pants
[2926.28 → 2931.96] and short circuit sweatpants, but they don't look wait they don't look like they match the track
[2931.96 → 2939.88] jacket very well you can submit to their newsletter uh do the track joggers subscribe to their newsletter
[2939.88 → 2945.96] that's so interesting is it looking at images do the track joggers seem to match oh interesting
[2945.96 → 2957.24] no but I didn't lose the context of Ltd store with that search it did it did hold on is that
[2957.24 → 2961.16] is that even what we call them wait wait wait it just said Ltd store in there hold on hold
[2961.16 → 2965.80] on hold on hold on I'm coming back I'm coming back the track joggers from Ltd store
[2965.80 → 2973.88] what it has the same colour scheme and logo okay shut up do we even say that do we say that Luke
[2976.20 → 2982.68] we don't we don't say it has the same colour scheme and logo they checked the logo
[2982.68 → 3012.68] holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy Holyoke holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holyский holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy actually holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy Hot holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy healing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy
[3012.68 → 3014.40] Wow, this is crazy.
[3014.70 → 3016.66] The trunk question is fascinating to me
[3016.66 → 3020.06] because that is like 100% something
[3020.06 → 3021.88] that someone could be tasked with,
[3022.28 → 3023.98] or not that exact one maybe,
[3024.22 → 3025.62] but something very similar
[3025.62 → 3027.18] is something that someone could be tasked with.
[3027.36 → 3031.28] Maybe the dimensions of the inside of a cube van
[3031.28 → 3033.30] or the inside of the bed of a truck
[3033.30 → 3034.54] with a tonnes cover on it.
[3034.70 → 3037.74] How many of this exact thing can I fit inside it?
[3037.84 → 3039.60] How much lumber can I fit inside
[3039.60 → 3041.66] a standard sized F-150 truck bed?
[3041.66 → 3042.52] I want to know how-
[3042.52 → 3043.94] That might be something someone wants to know.
[3044.00 → 3046.84] I want to know how carefully it's analyzing images.
[3047.26 → 3048.80] There are no reviews of the product.
[3049.14 → 3051.00] So it didn't see anything in text.
[3051.34 → 3051.66] Nothing.
[3052.22 → 3055.94] Our descriptions notoriously are-
[3055.94 → 3057.40] Oh, can you go back?
[3057.66 → 3058.78] In need of some improvement.
[3059.10 → 3060.20] There's only one version.
[3060.32 → 3061.26] There's no-
[3061.26 → 3062.00] Oh wait, hold on.
[3062.00 → 3062.64] No, no, no, I missed-
[3062.64 → 3063.20] Yeah, that's it.
[3063.42 → 3065.42] It does say get the matching.
[3065.60 → 3066.62] That's the only thing that-
[3066.62 → 3068.98] Yeah, but it didn't say it had the same logo, Luke.
[3069.66 → 3071.50] There's nothing on this page.
[3071.66 → 3071.98] Yeah.
[3072.06 → 3074.40] To say it has the same colour scheme and the same logo.
[3074.76 → 3076.52] It f***ING checked.
[3077.02 → 3077.30] Yeah.
[3078.40 → 3080.52] With images that like, to be honest-
[3080.52 → 3080.64] Yeah.
[3080.64 → 3082.06] There isn't one as far as I know.
[3082.14 → 3083.08] That's just a zoom in of the-
[3083.08 → 3083.64] Oh, there is right there.
[3083.64 → 3084.14] Yeah, we've got it.
[3084.14 → 3084.58] We've got it.
[3084.60 → 3085.02] Okay, okay.
[3085.02 → 3086.88] But it had to check the whole thing.
[3087.40 → 3089.52] There's one image showing this logo.
[3089.88 → 3090.20] Clearly.
[3090.20 → 3091.70] Yeah.
[3091.98 → 3095.28] Most of the images, it's there, but it's pretty small because it's like a zoom out of the whole person.
[3095.28 → 3096.06] What just happened?
[3096.84 → 3097.10] Yeah.
[3097.36 → 3099.14] Google just got irrelevanted.
[3099.48 → 3102.16] Conrad said in chat, I might actually use Bing when this comes out.
[3102.24 → 3102.52] Yeah.
[3103.74 → 3104.46] You will.
[3105.06 → 3106.98] I tried to jump the wait list.
[3108.42 → 3109.54] I did everything I could.
[3109.60 → 3113.54] I set to defaults, and then I changed it back afterwards because I don't think they're tracking that.
[3113.56 → 3113.78] Hold on.
[3113.86 → 3114.10] Hold on.
[3114.24 → 3118.78] And I installed the Bing app on my phone because 100% I would switch immediately.
[3118.98 → 3119.20] Hold on.
[3119.22 → 3120.30] People are asking about alt text.
[3120.44 → 3120.84] Just a sec.
[3120.90 → 3121.16] Just a sec.
[3121.22 → 3121.50] Just a sec.
[3121.50 → 3123.18] How do you see it?
[3123.72 → 3123.94] Crap.
[3124.70 → 3125.22] I thought them...
[3125.22 → 3125.74] Oh, okay.
[3125.78 → 3126.64] I think we only have it...
[3126.64 → 3126.80] Yeah.
[3126.88 → 3127.02] No.
[3127.12 → 3127.40] No, no, no.
[3127.42 → 3128.44] There's nothing in there about that.
[3130.16 → 3130.90] What the hell?
[3130.90 → 3131.94] That's different.
[3133.04 → 3133.40] Wow.
[3135.02 → 3135.38] Okay.
[3135.90 → 3136.22] Okay.
[3136.42 → 3136.90] So hold on.
[3137.20 → 3137.46] Okay.
[3137.88 → 3138.20] Okay.
[3138.34 → 3139.28] I got to...
[3139.28 → 3140.08] I'm not done yet.
[3140.14 → 3140.70] I'm not done yet.
[3141.76 → 3144.36] Try to get it to match unrelated products on the store.
[3144.36 → 3144.50] No.
[3144.64 → 3145.50] I want it to...
[3145.50 → 3145.70] Okay.
[3145.90 → 3146.14] Okay.
[3146.50 → 3147.62] That's a whole...
[3147.62 → 3150.46] That's a whole can of worms that we can go down.
[3150.48 → 3150.82] I mean...
[3150.82 → 3151.06] Okay.
[3151.08 → 3156.30] We know it has at least rudimentary ability to recognize stuff like that because it said,
[3156.40 → 3158.68] hey, the pajama pants don't seem to match this very well.
[3158.92 → 3159.16] Right?
[3159.32 → 3159.46] Yeah.
[3159.46 → 3160.50] Like it figured that out.
[3160.60 → 3167.70] But I want to know, does LTT's lanyard seem durable?
[3169.00 → 3169.40] Like...
[3169.40 → 3170.78] Is that in our thing?
[3170.86 → 3171.86] Do we say that it's durable?
[3172.02 → 3172.66] I'm going to check.
[3172.74 → 3173.28] I'm going to check.
[3174.62 → 3175.32] I'm sorry.
[3175.42 → 3179.58] I'm freaking out a little bit right now because this is better than I expected.
[3179.58 → 3179.94] Yeah.
[3179.94 → 3183.34] And I've been sitting here with you hearing you go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, chat,
[3183.40 → 3186.80] GPT, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, future, future, bing, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[3186.80 → 3187.58] ahead of...
[3187.58 → 3191.92] I mean, anyone reporting on it in the news because you figured it out before they went public with
[3191.92 → 3192.06] it.
[3192.24 → 3192.44] Yeah.
[3192.44 → 3197.46] So that's the context for this though, is that I'm still blown away.
[3197.54 → 3199.20] I mean, you seem blown away.
[3199.40 → 3199.68] Oh yeah.
[3200.18 → 3201.96] Like, did you expect it to be this good?
[3202.52 → 3207.02] I have known for a long time that once it gained the ability to search the internet,
[3207.40 → 3208.90] that it would be a whole different beast.
[3209.60 → 3214.00] But I didn't know how effectively it would do more than one search.
[3214.00 → 3218.94] The, the, I, I'm, I'm really telling you when I saw that tweet, my brain exploded because
[3218.94 → 3220.76] it grabbed the context.
[3220.76 → 3222.48] It searched the first thing.
[3222.56 → 3224.26] It was like, this didn't give me an answer.
[3224.36 → 3227.66] I'm now going to search these two various things to gain information.
[3227.66 → 3232.68] And then ours went even deeper, and it figured out, oh, it matches standard luggage sizes,
[3232.74 → 3233.28] all this kind of stuff.
[3233.40 → 3238.24] Like pictures, the amount of steps, pictures, the amount of steps that it did.
[3238.24 → 3243.10] That would have been a significant amount of work for a human, a very significant amount
[3243.10 → 3243.46] of work.
[3243.74 → 3245.06] Did it look at videos?
[3246.82 → 3247.98] That would be interesting.
[3249.24 → 3251.24] It's watching us right now.
[3256.94 → 3260.12] Based on some videos of the model Y trunk.
[3262.26 → 3263.76] Yeah, I did say that, didn't it?
[3268.24 → 3272.06] Did it link to this?
[3272.26 → 3272.62] Yes.
[3272.84 → 3273.88] Who packs more junk in the trunk?
[3275.22 → 3275.58] Whoa.
[3276.06 → 3277.46] Is there a transcription for that?
[3277.88 → 3279.04] Because that was an article, right?
[3279.24 → 3281.22] Did they, did they write out like everything that was in the video?
[3281.30 → 3289.92] I don't know, Luke, but it, it specifically cited this page and said based on some videos.
[3290.84 → 3293.42] Maybe, maybe the page is based on the videos.
[3293.60 → 3296.84] I mean, it could have, it could have used, I don't think it would watch the video necessarily.
[3296.84 → 3298.70] Maybe it would, I don't know.
[3298.78 → 3299.90] I have no idea what's going on anymore.
[3300.14 → 3306.14] But it might have used Whisper, another open AI tool, to gain the text transcription of
[3306.14 → 3306.58] the video.
[3307.04 → 3308.36] And then it could have parsed that.
[3310.92 → 3311.64] Okay, here.
[3311.78 → 3312.74] He's asking it some stuff.
[3312.76 → 3313.72] I'm asking it something else.
[3313.84 → 3313.98] Okay.
[3314.66 → 3319.02] LTT says their lanyard is built to last, but do the materials look durable to you?
[3319.98 → 3320.38] Interesting.
[3321.14 → 3324.64] I mean, look, I have no idea if it has this kind of capability.
[3324.96 → 3325.12] Okay.
[3325.12 → 3326.28] So it's looking up the lanyard.
[3326.42 → 3326.54] Yeah.
[3326.54 → 3328.54] Now there are two results for lanyard on the store.
[3329.82 → 3331.00] So I'm going to get another item.
[3331.12 → 3334.86] According to the product description, it's constructed from heavy-duty nylon weave, featuring
[3334.86 → 3336.92] a box stitch link and a medium pressure metal clasp.
[3337.00 → 3338.50] These materials are supposed to make that terrible.
[3339.24 → 3339.54] Okay.
[3340.12 → 3341.88] Oh my God, it read reviews!
[3347.22 → 3348.26] Which are very positive.
[3348.36 → 3349.94] It might, it might, it might.
[3350.06 → 3351.24] Just look at the star rating.
[3351.24 → 3354.00] No, no, no, no, no.
[3354.40 → 3357.56] Most of which are positive and praise the quality and appearance.
[3360.92 → 3361.32] Okay.
[3361.70 → 3362.10] Okay.
[3362.92 → 3363.76] Uh, yeah.
[3363.80 → 3367.38] Ask it for what, what are, what are, maybe, maybe refine it in a weird way.
[3367.46 → 3368.30] Ask it for two star.
[3368.58 → 3368.98] What do people...
[3368.98 → 3369.66] Instead of just negative?
[3369.66 → 3370.88] No, no, no, I got this.
[3370.92 → 3371.14] Okay.
[3371.94 → 3373.12] What about the negative reviews?
[3373.12 → 3374.94] What do people not like about it?
[3375.78 → 3377.50] Holy shit.
[3377.50 → 3386.32] Not very common, but they do exist.
[3386.70 → 3389.34] Some of the complaints, it's too short and sits too high on the chest.
[3389.44 → 3392.36] The clip is hard to use and makes taking keys off the lad, and you're difficult.
[3393.16 → 3396.60] The review system is not reliable and allows people to leave reviews without purchasing the
[3396.60 → 3397.02] product.
[3398.46 → 3399.68] It knew that!
[3399.68 → 3403.06] Holy shit.
[3403.56 → 3403.92] Whoa!
[3404.72 → 3410.18] That last bullet point is big because we're like moving to change that now.
[3410.34 → 3411.12] Not even kidding.
[3411.22 → 3412.26] That is actually real.
[3412.46 → 3413.34] That is possible.
[3413.62 → 3415.66] There was a reason why we didn't change it in the past.
[3415.72 → 3418.94] I don't remember what it was, but we're moving to change it now.
[3419.70 → 3422.66] By the way, the length thing is probably based on older reviews.
[3422.82 → 3427.10] We revised it to be a couple inches longer in response to that feedback, incidentally.
[3427.10 → 3433.32] You know what's going to be significantly faster now is parsing feedback for items on the store.
[3433.74 → 3438.96] Why bother manually go through and read it all when you just ask it for a summary of
[3438.96 → 3442.70] everything that's currently seemingly wrong with your products, and it will immediately
[3442.70 → 3447.72] spit it out and also give you feedback on the website.
[3448.06 → 3451.08] That was crazy and accurate and good feedback.
[3452.46 → 3452.94] Whoa!
[3452.94 → 3453.28] Whoa!
[3453.28 → 3457.44] Whoa!
[3460.50 → 3465.26] Okay, I want to see it try to match unrelated things on the store.
[3465.80 → 3470.74] So what my idea is, is can we ask it to match a water bottle?
[3470.74 → 3472.98] Sorry, I picked up my water bottle to take a drink.
[3473.30 → 3476.06] I did not take a drink and put it back down.
[3476.06 → 3477.06] Luke.
[3477.06 → 3478.06] Luke.
[3478.06 → 3479.06] Do you know what I want?
[3479.06 → 3484.28] I want it to give me a summary of this WAN show.
[3484.28 → 3487.28] It's live right now.
[3487.28 → 3488.58] Yeah, but Google has live transcriptions.
[3488.58 → 3490.58] I don't think it'll be able to do that.
[3490.58 → 3491.58] No?
[3491.58 → 3492.58] I mean, we could try it.
[3492.58 → 3493.70] I don't think that's going to be a success.
[3493.70 → 3494.92] I don't think that's reasonable.
[3494.92 → 3495.92] Yeah.
[3495.92 → 3497.92] I mean, we are already, we are already-
[3497.92 → 3499.08] We're a bit beyond reason.
[3499.08 → 3503.14] Yeah, I mean, it ain't no reason where we're going, boys.
[3503.14 → 3504.44] Okay, can you ask?
[3504.44 → 3505.44] Can you ask?
[3505.44 → 3509.44] Um, so the water bottle, let's pick that.
[3509.44 → 3513.08] So go to the water bottle and pick a colour that you like.
[3513.08 → 3520.58] Okay, can you pick a colour of water bottle to match my LTT tracksuit?
[3520.58 → 3522.80] Tracksuit, sure.
[3522.80 → 3525.46] You might want to specify the water bottle should be from LTTstore.com.
[3525.46 → 3528.52] Can you pick a colour of LTT water bottle to match my tracksuit?
[3528.52 → 3529.52] I mean, or not.
[3529.52 → 3530.52] Yeah, sure.
[3530.52 → 3531.52] Oh, man.
[3531.52 → 3534.30] Oh, man.
[3534.30 → 3535.72] It looks for the water bottle.
[3535.72 → 3537.30] It looks for the tracksuit.
[3537.30 → 3539.72] It's looking at stuff.
[3539.72 → 3540.72] Oh.
[3540.72 → 3542.72] Oh, it couldn't find it.
[3542.72 → 3543.72] Oh.
[3543.72 → 3550.34] If you were looking for a water bottle, some of the colours that might go well with the
[3550.34 → 3552.86] tracksuit are black, white, red, or blue.
[3552.86 → 3556.24] You can also mix and match different colours for the lid and body of the water bottle.
[3556.24 → 3560.58] In its defence, which is not super major because I'm actually surprised it didn't figure this
[3560.58 → 3563.58] one out, but we don't call it tracksuit anywhere.
[3563.58 → 3564.58] Yeah.
[3564.58 → 3565.58] Okay.
[3565.58 → 3570.58] Uh, oh, hold on a second.
[3570.58 → 3572.36] Oh, so you know what?
[3572.36 → 3574.86] I think this is our first kind of swing and a miss here.
[3574.86 → 3575.54] A little bit.
[3575.54 → 3575.78] Yeah.
[3575.78 → 3582.20] Because that link is, uh, yeah, men's tracksuit from Nike.
[3583.20 → 3583.76] Yeah.
[3583.76 → 3587.56] This is just, this is the, the black and black one.
[3588.04 → 3589.70] Uh, it's in stock.
[3589.86 → 3591.20] So that's something.
[3592.30 → 3592.86] Okay.
[3592.86 → 3593.86] Okay.
[3593.86 → 3594.78] This is Amazon.ca though.
[3594.78 → 3596.74] Did it intentionally send me to Amazon.ca?
[3596.74 → 3597.74] Okay.
[3597.74 → 3602.28] I was going to say one of the first weeks that we talked about ChatGPT, I mentioned how I,
[3602.28 → 3607.34] I was in the camp where I thought, uh, VR and AR were going to be like the future.
[3607.74 → 3608.18] Yeah.
[3608.26 → 3610.94] And on one of those first weeks I was like, never mind.
[3610.94 → 3611.54] It's this.
[3612.42 → 3615.18] And I think that just got a lot more deeply rooted.
[3615.56 → 3616.04] Yeah.
[3616.04 → 3618.40] Even with that failure, it doesn't matter.
[3618.54 → 3620.46] Look at all the successes that it just had before then.
[3620.66 → 3620.94] Yeah.
[3620.94 → 3628.82] We do not have a red LTT logo.
[3629.94 → 3631.84] Where did it get that from?
[3632.50 → 3633.46] No, they exist.
[3633.60 → 3635.70] There's a red LTT logo on one of the water bottles.
[3635.88 → 3641.54] No, but the track jacket, it says the track jacket has a white and black colour scheme with
[3641.54 → 3644.22] a red LTT logo on the chest and the back.
[3644.84 → 3646.26] Is it making assumptions?
[3646.68 → 3648.76] I want to know why it thinks that.
[3649.44 → 3649.68] Okay.
[3649.84 → 3650.28] Clothing.
[3651.60 → 3652.04] Sorry.
[3652.14 → 3657.02] I know that I'm basically just using this entire topic as an excuse to talk about LTT store.
[3657.50 → 3659.42] I mean, it's a it's an acceptable medium.
[3660.68 → 3661.08] Okay.
[3661.10 → 3663.98] So maybe this is, remember, remember the confidently wrong thing?
[3664.14 → 3666.06] Maybe we're giving it a little bit too much credit.
[3666.32 → 3667.78] Maybe it's not actually looking at the pictures.
[3668.90 → 3670.30] Maybe it's making some guesses.
[3671.60 → 3672.44] I don't know.
[3672.52 → 3674.14] I think it's looking at pictures, Luke.
[3675.08 → 3675.48] Okay.
[3675.54 → 3676.60] I mean, I could be wrong.
[3676.70 → 3678.14] Why does it think it's red?
[3678.90 → 3679.30] I don't know.
[3679.30 → 3680.26] Super weird.
[3680.26 → 3682.86] That's super weird.
[3684.20 → 3684.64] Okay.
[3685.44 → 3685.88] Okay.
[3686.08 → 3686.98] Oh, oh, yeah.
[3687.12 → 3687.30] Yeah.
[3688.10 → 3689.44] Ask it why it thinks it's red.
[3690.02 → 3690.42] Okay.
[3691.54 → 3691.98] Okay.
[3692.14 → 3692.40] Sure.
[3692.52 → 3693.02] Ask it for its evidence.
[3693.14 → 3694.24] Someone in Flow point job mentioned that.
[3694.24 → 3697.86] I don't see a red logo on that jacket.
[3698.58 → 3699.36] At Green 7.
[3699.54 → 3701.04] Can you send me the picture?
[3702.50 → 3702.88] Okay.
[3703.68 → 3704.34] Colour board?
[3704.54 → 3705.06] I don't know.
[3706.52 → 3707.78] Can you send me the picture?
[3707.92 → 3708.22] Interesting.
[3708.22 → 3709.20] Yeah.
[3709.20 → 3709.22] Yeah.
[3709.38 → 3710.98] Like, oh, whoa.
[3711.22 → 3712.16] Underscore red.
[3717.16 → 3723.24] Holy crap.
[3723.40 → 3726.62] So, it got the red logo from the file name?
[3727.18 → 3727.48] No.
[3727.82 → 3728.30] Searching.
[3728.68 → 3729.14] Track jacket.
[3729.14 → 3730.46] Okay.
[3730.46 → 3730.78] Wait.
[3731.40 → 3733.02] I have read some stuff.
[3733.24 → 3734.44] I don't know how legit this is.
[3734.60 → 3738.40] But you might want to start a new thread and try this whole thing over again.
[3738.60 → 3738.86] Okay.
[3738.90 → 3739.46] But it checked.
[3739.62 → 3740.68] It did look at pictures.
[3740.78 → 3741.22] For sure.
[3741.74 → 3745.72] I found one on the product page which shows a black and white jacket with a white logo.
[3746.36 → 3746.62] Wait.
[3746.74 → 3746.90] What?
[3746.90 → 3749.26] What's the one on the?
[3750.26 → 3751.12] Click on the link.
[3751.44 → 3752.66] Because that's not the right thing.
[3752.72 → 3752.86] Yeah.
[3752.90 → 3754.14] That's not our store.
[3754.78 → 3758.48] And that's also not a black and white track jacket with a red logo.
[3759.10 → 3759.50] What?
[3760.20 → 3760.60] Okay.
[3760.60 → 3761.50] Start a new thread.
[3761.82 → 3768.40] I've read that this version will kind of lose the plot once your thread gets too long.
[3768.52 → 3768.84] Okay.
[3769.04 → 3770.58] I forgot about that until now.
[3770.88 → 3771.32] But, yeah.
[3771.32 → 3771.72] How do I?
[3771.80 → 3772.70] Let's start a new thread.
[3772.82 → 3773.08] Man.
[3773.12 → 3774.58] I refreshed the page and it's still.
[3775.98 → 3776.38] Okay.
[3776.38 → 3776.96] Yeah, right.
[3777.06 → 3777.66] It's because of this.
[3778.00 → 3778.50] Hold on.
[3778.60 → 3779.08] Oh, whoa.
[3779.26 → 3779.36] Okay.
[3780.04 → 3780.42] Okay.
[3780.48 → 3781.02] Bing.com.
[3781.06 → 3781.40] Let's go.
[3782.68 → 3783.00] Okay.
[3783.12 → 3783.36] Okay.
[3783.42 → 3785.32] What were we trying to figure out?
[3785.60 → 3786.04] Oh, okay.
[3786.12 → 3786.38] Okay.
[3786.38 → 3786.46] Okay.
[3786.46 → 3794.02] Can you pick a water bottle on LTT store to match my LTT track jacket?
[3795.50 → 3795.74] Okay.
[3795.84 → 3796.90] Let's just see.
[3797.52 → 3797.66] Okay.
[3797.76 → 3798.62] Insulated water bottle.
[3798.64 → 3799.06] No, no.
[3799.08 → 3799.90] This is just standard search.
[3799.98 → 3800.58] You better go to chat.
[3800.74 → 3801.10] Here we go.
[3801.10 → 3807.26] My mind is absolutely annihilated right now.
[3813.66 → 3814.14] Okay.
[3814.14 → 3815.56] I want one that.
[3815.64 → 3817.04] Are these just Amazon links?
[3817.86 → 3818.70] Oh, interesting.
[3819.42 → 3820.42] Those look like.
[3821.64 → 3822.12] No.
[3822.42 → 3823.38] Those are LTT store links.
[3823.38 → 3823.48] Okay.
[3823.48 → 3828.26] I want one that will look good with my new LTT track jacket.
[3828.94 → 3829.26] Okay.
[3839.00 → 3839.60] Okay.
[3839.60 → 3843.94] It just called it simple and stylish.
[3844.28 → 3845.16] Chest and back.
[3845.22 → 3846.32] How on earth?
[3846.90 → 3847.92] Chest and back again.
[3848.84 → 3849.84] Workshop jacket.
[3851.46 → 3852.50] It's losing the plot.
[3852.62 → 3853.78] It's having issues with this one.
[3854.16 → 3856.60] I think one of the things that it might be struggling with.
[3856.66 → 3856.98] Yeah.
[3857.12 → 3858.98] Is the colour selector for the water bottle.
[3859.72 → 3860.10] Yeah.
[3860.26 → 3860.98] I think you're right.
[3860.98 → 3865.28] It doesn't know because in the images on the side of the water bottle.
[3865.84 → 3867.58] There's just every colour possible.
[3867.58 → 3872.16] And then I have a feeling that it can't parse through the colour selector.
[3872.38 → 3872.94] That makes sense.
[3873.10 → 3876.32] And we have fun, but weird names for things.
[3876.42 → 3881.28] I mean, not pink, but like sunrise, cream scream, hero.
[3881.82 → 3884.12] Like, I don't think it's going to know how to parse that either.
[3884.34 → 3884.66] Yeah.
[3884.76 → 3885.08] Okay.
[3885.20 → 3885.54] Okay.
[3885.88 → 3889.54] It suggested a 21 ounce one that would be more convenient to carry around though.
[3890.02 → 3894.24] Like, it's not like it's even when it's failing.
[3894.44 → 3894.76] Failing.
[3894.76 → 3896.06] It's not like it's completely.
[3896.06 → 3897.78] It's not stupid.
[3898.04 → 3898.22] Yeah.
[3898.46 → 3898.82] It's trying.
[3898.82 → 3898.96] You know?
[3899.30 → 3902.10] It's just maybe missing some amount of capability.
[3902.74 → 3904.46] That's a super specific question though.
[3904.54 → 3904.80] Yeah.
[3905.24 → 3906.10] Pretty interesting.
[3906.28 → 3906.64] All right.
[3907.76 → 3909.20] I am.
[3909.42 → 3911.06] Shirts are more specific colours.
[3912.08 → 3912.88] Maybe ask it.
[3912.88 → 3915.64] I'm getting a...
[3915.64 → 3918.70] Okay.
[3919.24 → 3919.56] Yeah.
[3919.60 → 3921.36] You wanted to ask it some other stuff about the store.
[3921.46 → 3921.58] Sorry.
[3921.64 → 3922.84] I think I kind of hijacked it.
[3923.08 → 3923.54] No, it's fine.
[3923.68 → 3926.16] I wanted to ask the same question you were asking, but in the other way.
[3926.86 → 3929.20] I wanted to give it a...
[3929.20 → 3931.80] One of the multicoloured items and ask it for a single coloured item.
[3932.18 → 3932.58] Effectively.
[3933.52 → 3938.06] So like, I don't know if you want to hand it this much information, but like I'm getting
[3938.06 → 3941.88] a white and black LTT water bottle.
[3942.10 → 3945.20] Can you suggest a shirt from the same store that would go with it?
[3945.20 → 3948.22] Something like that.
[3948.86 → 3952.22] I was hoping to be able to give it like one of the obscure names.
[3952.30 → 3955.18] Like I'm getting a hero water bottle.
[3956.00 → 3958.24] But at this point, I don't think it's going to be able to do that.
[3958.32 → 3961.00] And white and black is technically one of the names that we use for it.
[3961.16 → 3961.54] So whatever.
[3961.64 → 3963.90] Can you suggest some clothes from the same store that would go with it?
[3964.12 → 3964.54] How about that?
[3965.48 → 3965.72] Okay.
[3968.70 → 3968.98] Clothes.
[3969.22 → 3969.88] I mean, okay.
[3970.16 → 3970.62] That's fine.
[3970.88 → 3971.64] Yeah, that's fair.
[3972.04 → 3973.20] Clothing is a category, right?
[3973.20 → 3975.54] I can suggest some stuff that would go with your water bottle.
[3975.82 → 3976.86] GPU plush.
[3977.26 → 3978.26] Underwear three pack.
[3978.50 → 3978.74] Whoops.
[3979.38 → 3980.02] Too generic.
[3980.58 → 3981.62] Ruhr.
[3984.70 → 3988.10] Honestly, a lot of those things aren't clothes.
[3991.38 → 3991.82] Okay.
[3992.04 → 3992.30] I mean...
[3992.30 → 3992.66] Oh, yeah.
[3992.78 → 3993.48] GPU plush.
[3993.58 → 3994.00] Not clothes.
[3994.00 → 3994.38] Yeah, exactly.
[3994.58 → 3995.20] I didn't even put that together.
[3995.20 → 3997.20] And I specifically...
[3997.20 → 3997.60] Whoops.
[3998.18 → 4000.52] You can tell its doing stuff in the background here.
[4000.52 → 4005.58] I wanted something that matches my white and black water bottle.
[4005.62 → 4006.04] What do you mean?
[4006.12 → 4006.26] Why?
[4007.16 → 4007.72] Just...
[4007.72 → 4008.52] I can...
[4008.52 → 4011.28] When I'm typing, I can kind of feel it like thinking a bit.
[4011.68 → 4012.08] I don't know.
[4012.34 → 4013.44] So you think it's like pre-parsing?
[4013.62 → 4014.14] I'm sorry.
[4014.24 → 4014.84] I misunderstood.
[4015.24 → 4016.06] My bad.
[4018.56 → 4018.96] Wow.
[4019.10 → 4019.48] Okay.
[4020.00 → 4023.38] Maybe you could try the workshop jacket or the track jacket we talked about earlier.
[4023.48 → 4023.90] Wait, it...
[4023.90 → 4027.86] The workshop jacket is not black and white, though.
[4028.22 → 4029.28] Yeah, it was in this thread.
[4029.36 → 4030.02] It was in this thread.
[4030.16 → 4030.32] Okay.
[4030.66 → 4033.10] So why does it think the workshop jacket?
[4033.24 → 4036.26] For some reason, it's been fixed on the workshop jacket this whole conversation.
[4036.26 → 4036.28] Yeah.
[4036.28 → 4038.12] It really likes that workshop jacket.
[4039.58 → 4042.00] It thinks it's black and white.
[4042.00 → 4042.30] The t-shirt!
[4043.76 → 4045.72] Is that why it thinks the logo's orange?
[4045.80 → 4046.72] It was looking at this?
[4047.52 → 4047.88] Maybe.
[4048.18 → 4049.64] Is there an orange logo on this one?
[4049.70 → 4050.72] Sorry, I think I got away from the mic.
[4050.88 → 4051.44] On which one?
[4051.62 → 4052.72] On the workshop jacket.
[4052.72 → 4053.48] Is there an orange logo?
[4054.08 → 4055.70] Oh, is there an orange logo on the back?
[4056.36 → 4057.66] No, I don't think so.
[4057.72 → 4061.46] But there's this, which might have kind of looked logo-y.
[4062.10 → 4062.68] Maybe, yeah.
[4062.70 → 4063.90] And I don't think there's...
[4063.90 → 4065.38] We don't have a single picture of the back of it.
[4065.42 → 4065.72] Dang it.
[4067.32 → 4069.54] Why don't we have a picture of the back of the darn workshop jacket?
[4069.58 → 4070.72] Anyway, the point is...
[4072.00 → 4072.94] He's looking good, though.
[4073.64 → 4074.04] Interesting.
[4076.86 → 4077.96] Trey's interesting.
[4080.16 → 4080.52] Okay.
[4080.52 → 4082.52] I'm trying to think of, like...
[4082.52 → 4084.36] Different questions that we could ask it.
[4090.50 → 4090.94] Hmm.
[4091.60 → 4091.84] Okay.
[4092.58 → 4094.34] I'm assuming you're asking a question right now.
[4094.68 → 4099.86] Something that I've noticed has been an issue is something that I think should actually be quite searchable,
[4100.06 → 4101.68] which is, like, game guides.
[4102.46 → 4102.90] Oh, yeah.
[4103.08 → 4104.90] How do I beat this boss or whatever?
[4104.90 → 4108.68] But it hasn't been doing it because all the games that I've been searching have been too new.
[4109.06 → 4109.32] Right.
[4109.42 → 4109.82] That makes sense.
[4109.84 → 4111.06] So I wonder if it'll find that.
[4111.58 → 4111.88] Sure.
[4113.04 → 4113.32] Oh.
[4117.60 → 4118.00] Okay.
[4119.16 → 4119.80] You should have it.
[4119.88 → 4120.20] Okay.
[4120.20 → 4128.00] It did not really go outside a very, very narrow, narrow search here.
[4128.12 → 4130.28] It did not search the web more broadly.
[4131.28 → 4134.30] To be fair, you didn't ask it to, like, review it.
[4134.86 → 4137.14] So it gave you a state of what it is.
[4137.26 → 4138.46] Which is actually accurate.
[4138.54 → 4139.86] I think it's accurate to what you asked.
[4140.10 → 4141.24] You didn't even ask it anything.
[4141.34 → 4142.16] There's no question mark.
[4142.38 → 4146.56] You just Googled what LTT customer service is effectively.
[4147.16 → 4151.44] What are customers saying about the quality of their service?
[4151.64 → 4155.70] We do have to be honest with the quality of prompts.
[4155.98 → 4156.18] Yeah.
[4156.30 → 4156.46] Yeah.
[4156.52 → 4156.96] I mean, look.
[4157.28 → 4158.76] I mean, that's the thing is I'm trying to...
[4158.76 → 4159.58] This is a way of testing.
[4159.70 → 4160.50] I'm not actually...
[4160.50 → 4160.74] Yeah.
[4160.74 → 4162.84] But I'm trying to use it like a user would.
[4163.02 → 4163.04] Totally.
[4163.04 → 4164.28] Like, no, that doesn't answer my question.
[4164.40 → 4166.08] So I want to naturally interact with you.
[4166.10 → 4166.70] You were fine now.
[4166.76 → 4166.88] Yeah.
[4166.98 → 4169.58] There are mixed reviews of LTT stores customer service.
[4169.68 → 4170.00] Yeah, that's fair.
[4170.00 → 4172.70] Some say they had a great experience ordering from the website.
[4172.82 → 4173.60] The products are high quality.
[4173.72 → 4175.92] They also praise the support team for being helpful and responsive.
[4176.10 → 4179.28] However, some customers complain about long delivery times and items getting lost in the
[4179.28 → 4180.64] mail, which they blame on the website.
[4181.20 → 4185.54] One website gives LTTstore.com an average of 3.3 out of 5 based on one review.
[4186.06 → 4189.00] So it seems the quality of their service depends on various factors, such as the product,
[4189.08 → 4190.06] the shipping, and the support.
[4190.44 → 4192.66] You may have a different experience depending on your expectations.
[4193.64 → 4196.64] One thing I can say right now, by the way, guys, this was an excuse for me to talk
[4196.64 → 4202.74] about it is we are down to customer support responses during week, during the week, weekdays
[4202.74 → 4205.80] that are down to hours, not days anymore.
[4205.80 → 4207.96] So you can expect really fast responses.
[4209.34 → 4210.72] We're keeping the team beefy.
[4210.80 → 4213.68] We're not going to be like, oh, yeah, well, you know, volumes are lower.
[4214.16 → 4216.98] So, you know, we're back to, yeah, we're back to two people.
[4216.98 → 4222.36] So we're trying to find things for at least some of the extra members of the team that
[4222.36 → 4223.24] were brought on to do.
[4223.40 → 4229.28] And we want to make sure that we keep that team responding within hours as opposed to
[4229.28 → 4230.06] within days.
[4230.56 → 4233.68] Phil H. in Flow play Chat just brought up a fascinating point.
[4233.88 → 4234.10] Yeah.
[4234.24 → 4236.86] He tagged me and said, you just used the verb Googled.
[4237.96 → 4239.50] What might replace that word?
[4239.66 → 4239.70] Bing.
[4239.96 → 4243.62] I mean, that's what Microsoft's been trying to get us to do for 10 years or whatever.
[4244.36 → 4244.82] I binged it.
[4244.98 → 4245.08] Bing.
[4245.24 → 4245.84] I binged it.
[4245.84 → 4252.54] I mean, like as a technophile, obviously I would go like chat.
[4252.64 → 4253.04] Search.
[4253.16 → 4253.40] GPT.
[4253.86 → 4254.00] Yeah.
[4254.16 → 4258.44] Like I would know the underlying technology that I'm using.
[4258.44 → 4263.36] Well, they're trying to, they have an internal name for it called like Sylvie or something.
[4263.44 → 4264.16] I don't remember what it is.
[4264.62 → 4267.72] But they're trying to communicate externally that it's just Bing.
[4267.84 → 4273.12] It's such a shame that they used Cortana on such a piece of s*** product because that
[4273.12 → 4273.86] would have been great.
[4273.88 → 4274.94] Imagine Cortana was this.
[4274.94 → 4276.12] I know, right?
[4277.16 → 4278.08] Oh, yeah.
[4278.10 → 4279.46] I completely feel the same way.
[4279.74 → 4280.14] Yeah.
[4281.04 → 4283.32] Just such a missed opportunity.
[4284.32 → 4287.10] I'd be, I'd be so down for this to be Cortana.
[4287.20 → 4288.66] That would be super cool.
[4289.36 → 4291.86] It's also probably a little too Norrie and mainstream.
[4292.04 → 4295.44] Like, would you want, would you ask Cortana like for a recipe?
[4295.44 → 4296.78] You know?
[4297.66 → 4298.46] Like, I don't know.
[4298.88 → 4302.50] I mean, I wouldn't ask Cortana anything because she was useless for so long.
[4302.50 → 4302.76] Yeah.
[4303.16 → 4306.32] I mean, I wanted to like Cortana, but it was, it was rough, man.
[4306.68 → 4307.54] Oh, Geez.
[4307.66 → 4307.90] Okay.
[4307.94 → 4313.52] Well, we could honestly sit there and throw things through it for a million years.
[4313.52 → 4318.24] Do you want to, do you want to ask it how to beat biomass?
[4319.04 → 4319.32] Sure.
[4319.42 → 4320.46] Don't even refine the game.
[4320.52 → 4321.14] Just say biomass.
[4321.42 → 4321.56] Yeah.
[4321.56 → 4324.18] I'm already asking how good the LTT store screwdriver is though.
[4324.82 → 4325.12] Cool.
[4326.40 → 4327.92] I wonder if it'll reference videos.
[4327.92 → 4331.16] Wow.
[4331.52 → 4332.04] All right.
[4333.20 → 4333.64] Wow.
[4333.68 → 4337.96] It says that, uh, the embossed LTT logo on the end cap is tasteful.
[4338.06 → 4339.56] Where does it get that from?
[4339.80 → 4341.20] What is that based on?
[4341.88 → 4343.12] What do you mean tasteful?
[4343.20 → 4344.26] How do you know?
[4347.44 → 4348.10] It seems to be.
[4348.10 → 4351.94] Bing.com slash shop doesn't have the LTT store screwdriver.
[4352.72 → 4354.14] It's all Amazon links.
[4357.92 → 4360.84] Can't you find any user feedback for me?
[4360.98 → 4362.86] Like it says, go find some user feedback.
[4363.00 → 4364.06] No, you do it.
[4369.28 → 4371.42] And this is blowing my mind.
[4380.04 → 4380.56] Wow.
[4382.62 → 4383.68] There's your feedback.
[4383.68 → 4383.88] Okay.
[4387.28 → 4387.72] Okay.
[4387.80 → 4389.66] You may want to read more reviews and watch more videos.
[4390.22 → 4393.56] Uh, oh, oh, what videos would you recommend I watch?
[4396.84 → 4397.82] To learn more.
[4399.12 → 4401.74] I actually think this is not a fair summary, but whatever.
[4401.74 → 4411.94] I wonder if it errors on the side of like not being, not recommending too strongly.
[4411.94 → 4413.88] It seems like it tries to balance everything really hard.
[4414.04 → 4414.30] Yeah.
[4416.00 → 4421.08] It always ends with the like feedback might be mixed, or your experience may vary.
[4421.24 → 4421.84] That type of stuff.
[4423.22 → 4423.62] Huh.
[4424.26 → 4425.42] This is so cool.
[4425.54 → 4429.88] It gives you a top level overview of what you can expect to find in these videos.
[4429.88 → 4434.90] That is so cool.
[4436.10 → 4440.06] And those are probably, probably the ones you should watch.
[4440.16 → 4440.38] Yep.
[4441.16 → 4441.72] Wow.
[4443.00 → 4449.04] Now what's interesting is there's a there's a shorts video that's actually got a ton of views on the screwdriver.
[4449.04 → 4454.82] Uh, that's more recent, but I wonder if it's able to parse shorts, for example.
[4455.78 → 4458.30] Uh, I mean, I guess there's only one way to find out.
[4459.12 → 4462.32] Are there any short form reviews?
[4462.90 → 4465.56] Those videos are all pretty long.
[4465.56 → 4470.86] Man, I just, I feel like I could just talk to it forever.
[4471.20 → 4471.42] Okay.
[4471.58 → 4472.30] Uh, okay.
[4472.34 → 4472.70] So sorry.
[4472.78 → 4473.40] What, what game?
[4473.52 → 4474.12] Biomass?
[4474.30 → 4474.52] Yeah.
[4474.62 → 4476.22] It's just say Biomass, I think.
[4479.10 → 4479.50] Yeah.
[4479.52 → 4486.54] Because that's a that's a Manheim boss, but it's a, I think pretty unique name for a boss in a game.
[4486.64 → 4487.20] I don't know.
[4487.20 → 4493.88] Oh, it called our product description a review.
[4494.90 → 4496.58] Well, that's not very good.
[4499.02 → 4499.50] Okay.
[4500.78 → 4502.80] But they did find an opinion on Reddit.
[4503.16 → 4504.00] A couple on Reddit.
[4504.82 → 4505.20] Okay.
[4505.60 → 4506.00] All right.
[4506.02 → 4506.40] Very cool.
[4506.58 → 4506.82] Okay.
[4506.92 → 4509.90] How do I beat, um, how do I beat Biomass?
[4510.14 → 4510.44] Yeah.
[4510.58 → 4512.98] I don't even want to mention Manheim because I want it to figure it out.
[4513.06 → 4513.32] Okay.
[4516.18 → 4516.58] Sure.
[4517.20 → 4519.42] This is totally off-topic out of nowhere.
[4519.76 → 4520.52] That might be an interesting.
[4520.98 → 4522.36] How to beat Biomass.
[4522.50 → 4523.22] Biomass definition.
[4523.58 → 4523.68] Yeah.
[4523.80 → 4526.10] What, what the f*** are you talking about?
[4530.28 → 4531.06] Yeah, it is now.
[4531.06 → 4531.24] Oh!
[4531.88 → 4533.68] The third boss in the game, Manheim.
[4534.44 → 4535.92] The ways to beat it may vary.
[4536.04 → 4540.58] For example, if you mean the mass of living organisms, you need to reduce their population
[4540.58 → 4542.66] or their consumption of resources.
[4543.26 → 4544.54] Good gravy!
[4545.76 → 4546.54] Calm down!
[4546.54 → 4547.82] Whoa, buddy!
[4548.82 → 4551.08] Can you please clarify, though, which is fair?
[4551.08 → 4551.18] All right, Hal?
[4551.84 → 4555.32] The, the, the question that it asks at the end is fair, and they gave you a little smiley face.
[4555.44 → 4556.14] It's cute.
[4556.14 → 4564.88] Yeah, I don't want to reduce the population of living organisms.
[4566.52 → 4567.70] Oh my god.
[4568.28 → 4569.36] Oh, it's bone mass.
[4569.86 → 4570.36] Oh!
[4572.36 → 4575.16] It's still understood that it was from Manheim.
[4576.24 → 4576.70] Yeah.
[4576.70 → 4578.72] I said the wrong thing, though.
[4578.76 → 4579.66] It's bone mass.
[4581.50 → 4581.92] Oh.
[4584.88 → 4586.02] It figured it out.
[4586.16 → 4588.48] Probably through, like, common searches or something.
[4589.08 → 4589.50] Wow.
[4591.10 → 4592.24] That's actually crazy.
[4592.24 → 4593.02] I typed this.
[4593.02 → 4593.04] I typed this.
[4594.10 → 4595.62] How to beat bone mass in Manheim.
[4595.82 → 4598.02] Yeah, it just doesn't acknowledge my, uh...
[4598.02 → 4599.52] Oh, I see.
[4600.52 → 4603.64] Highly resistant to ranged weapons except for frost arrows.
[4603.74 → 4604.36] This is, this is...
[4604.36 → 4605.28] Oh, I didn't know that part.
[4605.74 → 4606.12] Okay.
[4606.36 → 4607.60] He throws poison smoke.
[4607.72 → 4609.52] The best weapons are blunt weapons.
[4609.62 → 4610.06] That's true.
[4611.06 → 4612.84] Increased stamina regeneration.
[4613.32 → 4616.24] Wow, this is a lot of, like, perfect starts, it looks like.
[4616.80 → 4617.14] Good luck.
[4617.16 → 4618.04] It is a good one.
[4619.40 → 4620.64] All right.
[4621.02 → 4621.30] Wow.
[4621.54 → 4623.10] Yeah, let's, uh, let's move on.
[4623.10 → 4627.32] The fact that it got bone mass from biomass, pretty interesting.
[4627.42 → 4629.28] We could do this all night, I think.
[4629.28 → 4633.18] Yeah, so let's, let's finish off the notes because there is some interesting stuff.
[4633.20 → 4633.52] Sure, yeah, hit it.
[4633.54 → 4635.02] This is a war, right?
[4635.14 → 4636.74] It's not just Bing search.
[4636.88 → 4638.00] There is the other side.
[4638.16 → 4639.28] So far, it's...
[4639.28 → 4641.22] So far, it's just Bing search.
[4641.22 → 4645.44] It's a war between your high school bully and, like, your toddler sister.
[4645.90 → 4646.86] Like, honestly.
[4649.14 → 4650.30] Yeah, a little brutal.
[4650.46 → 4656.42] Microsoft claims they're using a more powerful version of GPT-3.5 that they are calling the
[4656.42 → 4657.62] Prometheus model.
[4658.28 → 4663.88] Presumably, uh, in the sense that if it goes wrong, Microsoft CEO, uh, Satya Nadella will
[4663.88 → 4666.70] be tied to a rock for eagles to devour his liver.
[4667.08 → 4669.46] Uh, Microsoft, this is a big bet for him.
[4669.46 → 4670.42] Isn't it forever, too?
[4670.64 → 4671.18] I think so.
[4671.22 → 4671.68] I think so.
[4671.94 → 4672.06] Yeah.
[4672.06 → 4674.00] Uh, this is, this is a big bet for them, though.
[4674.30 → 4677.62] Uh, Microsoft will also launch two new features for Edge.
[4677.96 → 4682.16] Chat, which users can use to ask, uh, about the webpage they're looking at.
[4683.44 → 4683.80] Hmm?
[4684.12 → 4686.18] Uh, and Compose, a writing assistant.
[4687.04 → 4687.40] Okay.
[4687.66 → 4692.22] I don't think we saw Compose, but I think that was a weird description of chat, which is what
[4692.22 → 4692.74] we were just using.
[4692.74 → 4701.98] Um, only a day after Microsoft's demo, Google announced its own ChatGPT equivalent or, uh,
[4701.98 → 4704.84] similar thing called Bard.
[4705.08 → 4706.58] Some people have been criticizing that name.
[4706.62 → 4707.44] I actually think it's pretty cool.
[4707.44 → 4713.52] Um, Google's demo highlighted largely incremental and previously announced AI improvements to
[4713.52 → 4714.76] various Google products.
[4715.16 → 4721.26] In the demo, Google warned that answers given by Bard may be inaccurate, which is true about
[4721.26 → 4721.76] all of them.
[4721.76 → 4722.76] So, doesn't matter.
[4723.16 → 4727.48] Uh, some commenters noted that there was a clear inaccuracy in a screenshot included in
[4727.48 → 4731.84] Google's announcement, which states that the James Webb Space Telescope was the first to take a
[4731.84 → 4733.86] picture of a planet outside our solar system.
[4733.86 → 4739.96] The first was actually taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope actual
[4739.96 → 4741.18] name in 2004.
[4741.56 → 4746.14] Now, there are some kind of potential issues here.
[4746.36 → 4746.60] Mm-hmm.
[4748.50 → 4754.10] I have heard, uh, let me see if this screenshot is in here.
[4756.68 → 4759.82] I've heard our audience really likes tracksuits, but sorry, go ahead.
[4759.82 → 4763.72] Uh, this is just a random tweet.
[4763.86 → 4766.08] This doesn't look like the one that actually found it.
[4766.28 → 4766.84] I don't know.
[4767.16 → 4771.22] Um, so people read this and, and maybe they're right.
[4771.42 → 4772.42] I would just want to put that out there.
[4772.48 → 4777.16] Maybe people's interpretation of this was right, but people read this as it says here
[4777.16 → 4781.16] again, which states that the James Webb Space Telescope was the first to take a picture of
[4781.16 → 4782.92] a planet outside our solar system.
[4783.06 → 4785.36] People interpreted that as any planet.
[4788.50 → 4793.62] But people are thinking that maybe Bard was actually talking about a specific planet.
[4793.86 → 4794.66] I see.
[4794.82 → 4799.80] And the James Webb was the first telescope to take a picture of that planet.
[4799.80 → 4802.96] And that planet is outside our solar system.
[4803.16 → 4803.30] Yeah.
[4803.38 → 4804.64] So maybe it worded it weird.
[4804.78 → 4805.92] Maybe we interpret it poorly.
[4806.12 → 4806.96] I don't know.
[4806.96 → 4814.90] Um, but it's kind of irrelevant because Dan's question, please.
[4814.98 → 4816.10] I want to spammy DQP.
[4816.22 → 4816.74] I'm working on it.
[4816.80 → 4817.02] Okay.
[4817.60 → 4819.84] Um, yeah.
[4819.92 → 4820.16] Wow.
[4820.54 → 4822.90] Uh, I was trying to figure out what the heck DQP meant.
[4823.56 → 4826.06] Um, but yeah, it, it, it could have been right.
[4826.08 → 4826.62] It could have been wrong.
[4826.64 → 4827.30] It's kind of irrelevant.
[4827.44 → 4828.24] They're all right.
[4828.24 → 4829.04] And they're all wrong.
[4829.04 → 4835.56] Sometimes GBT 3.5, uh, ChatGPT, whatever we want to call this Bing search thing.
[4836.22 → 4837.90] They've all been wrong at some point.
[4838.54 → 4839.32] Bard will be wrong.
[4839.52 → 4840.18] This is wrong.
[4840.24 → 4841.42] Sometimes it doesn't really matter.
[4841.42 → 4848.60] Yeah.
[4848.68 → 4850.36] No, it can't just like watch a video.
[4850.60 → 4851.82] There was no way it was going to do that.
[4852.04 → 4852.16] Yeah.
[4852.24 → 4852.34] Yeah.
[4853.04 → 4854.96] Um, yeah.
[4854.96 → 4856.08] Otherwise, why would you need to watch?
[4857.30 → 4861.76] Apparently Google's valuation went down a hundred billion dollars when people figured
[4861.76 → 4864.52] out that Bard was wrong, which is weird to me.
[4864.52 → 4865.68] That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
[4865.68 → 4867.26] ChatGPT is wrong all the time.
[4867.28 → 4867.42] Yeah.
[4867.42 → 4868.04] Like constantly.
[4868.04 → 4872.38] I mean, it didn't know that the LTT store screwdriver is like the best.
[4874.24 → 4874.64] Terrible.
[4875.00 → 4877.60] So like that seems kind of weird to me.
[4877.82 → 4880.52] Um, but I mean, investors are going to do investor things.
[4880.86 → 4884.74] So by the way, this looks kind of like what you might've been talking about earlier, where
[4884.74 → 4889.78] you can be on a page and there's just like a search thing here, and you can just like,
[4889.88 → 4891.04] this is not what I was talking about earlier.
[4891.16 → 4894.56] I mean, this seems like it would be a really cool interface, but no, this just does a web
[4894.56 → 4894.84] search.
[4895.06 → 4895.26] Yeah.
[4895.26 → 4904.04] This does not, even if you tell it, uh, like this site, uh, it's basically just like, uh,
[4904.04 → 4907.16] you know, is this, uh, a good jacket?
[4907.16 → 4912.46] Like it, it doesn't, it, yeah, it just does not do anything like what we, what we saw before.
[4912.46 → 4918.60] So there's no chat integrated into that particular search at this time, unless I've not updated
[4918.60 → 4920.22] it properly or something like that.
[4920.22 → 4920.64] I'm not sure.
[4921.96 → 4922.48] All right.
[4922.80 → 4924.02] Um, yeah.
[4924.14 → 4925.30] So move on.
[4926.62 → 4926.98] Yeah.
[4926.98 → 4928.52] I can't get it to do it.
[4928.52 → 4935.74] When I was at home, uh, basically in your, in your standard search view pre-chat, that's
[4935.74 → 4939.00] an interesting thing to say, uh, where you have all the links to different websites to
[4939.00 → 4943.34] come up when you search something floating in the side where like, if you Googled yourself,
[4943.34 → 4947.20] you know how it would show like the Wikipedia thing with your picture in that same area,
[4947.20 → 4952.96] it was putting like a mini version of a non-refundable to chat output.
[4953.34 → 4959.44] Some people are saying there's, um, there's a version of edge that is like a dev version
[4959.44 → 4960.88] that has the new Bing features.
[4961.36 → 4963.72] So like you would be able to do that in it or something.
[4963.80 → 4965.42] This is just a pleb version of edge.
[4965.54 → 4965.60] So.
[4965.60 → 4965.88] Okay.
[4966.04 → 4966.22] Yeah.
[4966.28 → 4966.66] Got it.
[4967.02 → 4967.42] Wow.
[4967.42 → 4968.40] That makes sense.
[4968.76 → 4969.52] Uh, wow.
[4970.04 → 4970.28] Yeah.
[4970.42 → 4976.04] A third search provider, Baidu, headquartered in China, announced that it would finish internal
[4976.04 → 4979.60] testing of its own AI named Ernie in March.
[4980.22 → 4985.34] E-commerce company Alibaba also claims to be making a ChatGPT equivalent and Opera.
[4985.62 → 4988.40] And this is a dig that seems potentially unnecessary.
[4988.40 → 4994.80] Uh, but the world's sixth most popular browser says that they, they too will be incorporating
[4994.80 → 4995.74] ChatGPT.
[4997.42 → 4998.22] Whoa.
[4998.30 → 4998.70] Ouch.
[4999.22 → 4999.70] Whoa.
[5000.52 → 5000.96] Yep.
[5001.04 → 5001.52] Let's go.
[5002.76 → 5004.82] Everybody's getting in on this discussion question.
[5004.90 → 5010.10] What pitfalls do you foresee in the rush to integrate advanced AI into day to day technology?
[5010.28 → 5012.20] I think that's a pretty easy answer to be honest.
[5012.20 → 5012.74] I think so too.
[5012.80 → 5014.26] A lot of the confidently wrong.
[5014.34 → 5014.88] The wrongness.
[5014.98 → 5015.16] Yeah.
[5015.36 → 5019.90] I do think that as much as I say that, which is every single time we talk about this topic.
[5020.00 → 5020.52] He sure does.
[5020.66 → 5024.04] Um, it's important because people constantly forget it.
[5024.26 → 5025.74] Like it's actually crazy.
[5025.74 → 5025.92] Yeah.
[5025.92 → 5029.88] It's like the whole, it's like, it's like the whole discussion we had around Tesla branding
[5029.88 → 5031.86] their driving assists as autopilot.
[5032.18 → 5032.48] Yeah.
[5032.54 → 5037.66] And it's like, you get people who will get mad at me for criticizing it saying, well,
[5037.66 → 5039.22] that's not what autopilot means.
[5039.22 → 5042.10] Like even on a plane, it doesn't mean the plane flies itself.
[5042.18 → 5043.02] It still needs a pilot.
[5043.10 → 5046.60] Who'd be stupid enough to think that autopilot means it drives itself to stupid.
[5046.96 → 5048.88] No, because people do think that.
[5048.88 → 5049.44] A hundred percent.
[5049.56 → 5050.62] I don't make the rules.
[5051.34 → 5054.02] People fall asleep on the highway, like on purpose.
[5054.02 → 5056.60] They take a nap in their car with autopilot engaged.
[5057.58 → 5057.96] Yep.
[5058.40 → 5058.92] A hundred percent.
[5059.26 → 5063.40] Like, so we have to, so we have to remind.
[5063.80 → 5067.00] Humans, I, I, I, this is the caveat that I want to throw in here.
[5067.10 → 5067.52] Very trusting.
[5067.52 → 5069.86] Humans are also really confidently wrong.
[5070.00 → 5070.24] Yeah.
[5070.24 → 5073.92] So it's not like this is, this is like an unknown issue.
[5074.00 → 5079.38] Whoa, Luke, just laying the smack down on an entire species of animal here.
[5079.62 → 5083.48] But like, you should be skeptical about answers that come from ChatGPT.
[5083.64 → 5089.14] And you know, maybe you should take that skepticism to other parts of your life as well.
[5089.48 → 5096.08] Um, but like, yeah, like if you were just blindly believing every single Google search result
[5096.08 → 5099.44] that you got in the past, that was also a problem.
[5099.44 → 5103.44] I don't know if you like to realize that, but you shouldn't have been doing that.
[5103.92 → 5107.00] Um, and you still shouldn't do it with chat features.
[5109.08 → 5110.44] I didn't even see that question.
[5110.76 → 5111.92] I'm, I'm just Memling.
[5112.14 → 5118.80] Um, the next discussion question is, is there a concern with large companies under repressive
[5118.80 → 5121.34] governments constructing their own advanced AI?
[5121.80 → 5123.26] I mean, yeah, obviously.
[5123.48 → 5124.86] That's obviously definitely going to happen.
[5124.86 → 5125.94] Nothing much we can do about that.
[5126.04 → 5126.24] Yep.
[5126.94 → 5127.60] All right.
[5127.60 → 5127.80] Yeah.
[5127.80 → 5129.80] That's the thing with a lot of this type of technology.
[5129.94 → 5132.98] People talk about, oh, we need to like to regulate it super hard.
[5133.44 → 5134.44] And it's like, yeah.
[5135.04 → 5135.52] Good luck.
[5135.70 → 5137.00] Maybe in certain ways, but.
[5137.20 → 5138.94] We still haven't figured out how to regulate.
[5139.70 → 5140.46] Other countries will not.
[5140.46 → 5141.54] Just social media.
[5141.74 → 5144.26] Like you're not, you're not going to stop the wave of this happening.
[5144.38 → 5144.62] Yeah.
[5144.62 → 5148.04] Because some other country is just going to be like, oh, I mean, you can do it here.
[5148.44 → 5148.66] Yeah.
[5149.04 → 5152.88] We're going to find a way to get a leg up because companies are going to come here now because
[5152.88 → 5153.68] they can do this thing.
[5153.68 → 5153.70] Yeah.
[5153.70 → 5154.80] They can come here and not pay taxes.
[5154.96 → 5155.12] Yeah.
[5155.22 → 5155.86] Like it's.
[5157.44 → 5160.12] But hey, at least the people working there will, they'll pay their taxes.
[5160.22 → 5160.54] Yeah.
[5160.78 → 5161.32] But corporate tax?
[5161.58 → 5162.20] Nah, I don't need that.
[5162.20 → 5162.52] Never.
[5163.16 → 5166.20] Um, let's jump into another thing.
[5167.06 → 5167.68] Should we do this?
[5167.72 → 5168.62] It's another AI topic.
[5168.68 → 5169.32] Should we jump into it?
[5169.32 → 5173.04] You know what we should probably do is get sponsors out of the way and talk about what
[5173.04 → 5173.90] merch messages are.
[5174.06 → 5174.20] Yeah.
[5174.20 → 5176.62] You're probably seeing these messages pop up down here.
[5176.96 → 5179.16] Dan, our producer is monitoring them.
[5179.16 → 5184.22] If you guys make a purchase on lttstore.com, while we are live, we'll get a little pop-up
[5184.22 → 5185.64] prompting you for a merch message.
[5186.30 → 5191.34] It's basically better than Twitch bits or super chats or anything like that because we
[5191.34 → 5192.52] might get to your message.
[5192.62 → 5193.34] We might not.
[5193.46 → 5198.96] But if we don't, hey, at least you get some nice high quality, you know, tracksuits in the
[5198.96 → 5199.20] mail.
[5199.66 → 5199.68] Yeah.
[5199.94 → 5203.52] If nothing else, you can pick up a gift card and send a merch message that way, and then
[5203.52 → 5207.12] you can pick up something else that catches your eye farther down the line.
[5207.74 → 5210.16] Oh, we have something really cool coming.
[5211.20 → 5212.56] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5212.56 → 5213.12] Guess what's here.
[5213.86 → 5218.10] The, uh, it won't be applicable to you, unfortunately, but the WAG hoodie has arrived.
[5218.34 → 5220.32] Oh, uh, I mean, Chloe.
[5220.42 → 5222.06] You don't have a, oh, well, okay.
[5223.38 → 5224.16] For a little while.
[5224.30 → 5224.52] Yeah.
[5225.62 → 5226.46] Well, that's sad.
[5226.72 → 5226.86] Yeah.
[5226.86 → 5229.16] Um, well, you know what?
[5229.48 → 5230.50] She's doing pretty okay.
[5230.60 → 5235.16] Chloe can have a WAG hoodie for however short a time she will be wearing it.
[5235.74 → 5238.28] Um, this got pretty real.
[5238.36 → 5239.58] My parents' dog is quite old.
[5239.68 → 5239.90] Yeah.
[5240.16 → 5241.48] I've been holding it on for like a long time.
[5241.48 → 5242.54] Yeah, yeah, she's doing great.
[5242.70 → 5242.88] Yeah.
[5242.88 → 5244.24] But, um, she's pretty old.
[5244.24 → 5245.22] But it has been a long time.
[5245.32 → 5245.50] Yeah.
[5245.74 → 5246.34] Uh, cool.
[5246.50 → 5250.94] So anyway, the, uh, the WAN hoodie for dogs is, is, is kind of here.
[5250.94 → 5254.72] We haven't done pictures or like gotten it ready for the site or anything like that, but
[5254.72 → 5255.80] it's, it's almost ready to launch.
[5255.94 → 5257.30] You need a you need a flap now.
[5257.82 → 5258.60] A flap?
[5260.02 → 5261.96] Like a WAN hoodie for birds.
[5263.40 → 5264.26] I'd hate it.
[5264.70 → 5265.10] Yeah.
[5265.24 → 5268.12] I was going to say, animal cruelty much?
[5268.60 → 5270.18] Putting a hoodie on a bird?
[5270.18 → 5274.28] Probably, if, if, if you made it like a little WAN hoodie, like ornament that I could hang
[5274.28 → 5276.42] from the cage, I guarantee you they would love that.
[5276.50 → 5276.62] Yeah.
[5276.62 → 5278.34] They'd probably like to destroy it.
[5278.34 → 5278.66] Oh yeah.
[5278.86 → 5279.22] Immediately.
[5279.40 → 5280.08] Because they're birds.
[5280.48 → 5280.66] Yep.
[5281.08 → 5281.52] Um.
[5281.60 → 5282.16] They do that.
[5283.30 → 5283.66] Okay.
[5284.04 → 5284.32] Cool.
[5284.52 → 5284.94] Anywho.
[5285.20 → 5285.90] Um, right.
[5285.98 → 5289.84] So merch messages, we will try to get to some merch messages at the end of the show.
[5290.20 → 5293.34] And we'll want to thank our sponsors for sponsoring this.
[5294.92 → 5295.28] Whatever.
[5295.28 → 5297.94] Yeah, whatever the show is today.
[5298.26 → 5299.90] Uh, massive shout out Thrum.
[5300.02 → 5304.14] Thrum makes handmade wedding bands and rings from rare unique materials.
[5304.26 → 5308.42] They work with anything from whiskey barrels to antlers to Damascus steel to world, world
[5308.42 → 5311.02] war two rifle stocks to even dinosaur fossils.
[5311.56 → 5317.20] The Apollo is made out of hammered black tungsten carbide with a rose gold interior.
[5317.66 → 5321.34] Um, and the reason they chose these materials are because tungsten carbide will neither rust
[5321.34 → 5322.20] nor tarnish.
[5322.20 → 5327.32] Thrum claims that you can leave it in a vat of ferric chloride acid for a year and it
[5327.32 → 5328.52] will be entirely fine.
[5328.62 → 5332.94] Though we wouldn't recommend playing with, um, ferric chloride acid.
[5333.76 → 5336.30] We're having it around for an extended period of time.
[5336.54 → 5337.70] Uh, you can get a ring.
[5339.02 → 5341.86] What kind of sponsored talking points are these?
[5342.78 → 5346.96] Uh, you can get, you can get a ring size or a ring can tank it.
[5347.18 → 5348.74] You might not be able to, but it can.
[5348.74 → 5352.42] Don't put your hand in there, but the ring will be fine.
[5352.42 → 5357.96] Uh, you can get a sizer kit on their website to make life easier when it comes to picking,

[5394.82 → 5395.64] No, no, not brilliant.
[5395.64 → 5395.80] Squarespace.
[5396.14 → 5396.88] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5397.32 → 5398.76] Uh, first though, the Ridge.

[5441.48 → 5442.46] Now here's the thing.
[5442.74 → 5445.56] My Squarespace talking points are a little stale.
[5446.02 → 5447.54] I don't know who to blame for that.
[5447.76 → 5449.68] Probably someone, but it doesn't matter.
[5449.68 → 5454.02] The point is I have to do a sponsor read.
[5454.70 → 5458.64] So is this, they say that they have a thing that helps you with writing, but you're using
[5458.64 → 5460.94] the more web search thing.
[5461.06 → 5463.54] Does your browser not have the writing thing?
[5463.68 → 5464.66] Yeah, I don't really see it.
[5465.32 → 5467.06] I've just got search and chat.
[5467.20 → 5467.94] Yeah, I don't see it.
[5467.94 → 5469.18] I'm going to go for it.
[5469.26 → 5469.42] Sure.
[5469.76 → 5473.06] Um, whoa, what do you think?
[5473.14 → 5474.44] Whoa, I didn't even see this.
[5475.24 → 5476.22] Holy crap.
[5476.32 → 5477.18] That's powerful.
[5477.18 → 5483.56] It asked what you think of this whole saga that's gone on here and gives you a prompt.
[5484.60 → 5485.62] That's wild.
[5485.92 → 5491.54] So they're going to be like collecting political data.
[5491.86 → 5492.08] Whoa.
[5492.48 → 5492.92] What?
[5492.92 → 5497.88] I, okay, look, I'm not trying to steer the conversation back to being powered by chat
[5497.88 → 5499.92] GPT, but what the f*** just happened?
[5500.08 → 5503.20] Well, they're, they're trying to make it an actual chat, and they're going to harvest all
[5503.20 → 5506.72] the information from it, which is incredibly valuable data.
[5507.88 → 5508.32] Wow.
[5509.70 → 5510.26] Okay.
[5511.26 → 5511.70] Whoa.
[5512.48 → 5512.92] Whoa.
[5513.44 → 5513.92] Okay.
[5514.58 → 5514.98] Jeez.
[5514.98 → 5516.42] Oh man.
[5516.60 → 5517.02] Okay.
[5517.18 → 5517.96] This is something.
[5518.44 → 5518.94] All right.
[5519.00 → 5519.76] Uh, back to this.
[5519.94 → 5521.22] I have a to do.
[5521.40 → 5522.24] Oh, I have to.
[5522.38 → 5522.78] Sorry.
[5523.06 → 5529.78] Do a sponsor read on my podcast for Squarespace, but my talking points are a little stale.
[5531.22 → 5531.62] Sorry.
[5531.62 → 5535.32] This, um, can you write me?
[5535.44 → 5536.08] Oh my goodness.
[5537.08 → 5538.52] Oh, sorry.
[5538.70 → 5539.76] My brain is very tired.
[5539.76 → 5541.64] Should we clear the context before we do this?
[5541.64 → 5542.44] No, no, it's fine.
[5542.62 → 5542.82] Okay.
[5542.94 → 5544.18] Can you write me?
[5544.26 → 5545.24] Do they want that on the screen?
[5545.44 → 5546.28] Uh, 32.
[5547.28 → 5547.60] Whatever.
[5547.82 → 5548.28] They'll get over it.
[5548.54 → 5554.14] Can you write me a 30 to 60 second blurb with some of their latest features highlighted?
[5555.08 → 5558.86] Oh, apparently you need, yeah, you need the dev branch of edge for the sidebar compose
[5558.86 → 5559.32] feature.
[5559.66 → 5559.94] Got it.
[5560.28 → 5560.52] All right.
[5560.52 → 5562.04] So they just killed Grammarly, probably.
[5562.22 → 5564.24] I'm going to read this out verbatim.

[5646.92 → 5647.92] maybe it made up a feature.

[5661.04 → 5662.90] wolf world or something like that.
[5662.96 → 5664.84] Oh, she can just get it to write her books.
[5664.84 → 5669.02] Like honestly, like with the quality of the writing of some of the ones I've looked over
[5669.02 → 5672.36] her shoulder at, like she could just be like, write me another chapter, write me another
[5672.36 → 5673.78] chapter, write me another chapter.
[5673.86 → 5677.20] She could, if she doesn't like the direction that the book goes in.
[5677.68 → 5678.76] Choose your own adventure.
[5683.02 → 5685.74] Because I've done choose your own adventure stuff, right?
[5685.86 → 5689.60] But especially if it can search off the internet, like you could make a choosy your own adventure
[5689.60 → 5692.98] based on like vaguely real world events and stuff.
[5692.98 → 5693.48] People you know.
[5693.64 → 5693.86] Yeah.
[5694.08 → 5694.30] Yep.
[5694.30 → 5700.86] Man, uh, Tina's erotic fan, uh, friend fictions from, uh, Bob's Burgers are going to take on
[5700.86 → 5701.94] a whole new life here.
[5702.12 → 5707.12] Pretty much everyone and their dog is going to have, have the capability.
[5707.48 → 5709.82] So I want to do a poll here.
[5710.08 → 5710.42] Yeah.
[5710.92 → 5713.62] Um, Game of Thrones season eight rewrite.
[5713.76 → 5714.30] Let's go.
[5714.44 → 5715.14] Seriously though.
[5715.52 → 5715.80] Yeah.
[5716.04 → 5717.60] Like, oh my goodness.
[5717.68 → 5720.30] It probably could because this one can search the internet.
[5720.30 → 5721.90] So it knows everything about it.
[5722.52 → 5724.18] Can you, you should ask it that.
[5724.32 → 5725.36] What would you change?
[5726.68 → 5731.28] If you could change Game of Thrones season eight, what would you change about it to make
[5731.28 → 5732.00] it better or whatever?
[5732.40 → 5733.54] And I'm going to make this poll.
[5733.54 → 5733.82] Okay.
[5741.36 → 5741.72] Okay.
[5741.72 → 5746.52] We're really not trying to make the whole show just about Bing with ChatGPT.
[5746.62 → 5748.92] It's just, it's just kind of happening here.
[5748.94 → 5749.28] Okay.
[5749.28 → 5749.36] Okay.
[5750.56 → 5751.48] Oh man.
[5752.30 → 5756.28] This is just such a mind screw.
[5756.82 → 5756.98] Okay.
[5757.06 → 5758.66] No, I don't want.
[5758.72 → 5759.36] Yeah, there we go.
[5759.52 → 5759.66] Okay.
[5759.68 → 5760.58] Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[5760.66 → 5761.48] I want my little plane chat.
[5761.66 → 5762.32] Oh my God.
[5763.92 → 5764.32] Stop.
[5765.24 → 5765.64] Okay.
[5768.08 → 5768.82] There we go.
[5769.80 → 5770.18] Whoa.
[5770.86 → 5774.66] Give more time and development to the Night King and the White Walkers and make their final
[5774.66 → 5776.14] battle more epic and satisfying.
[5776.14 → 5779.88] Make Daenerys' descent into madness more gradual and believable.
[5780.04 → 5781.74] Show more of her inner conflict and struggle.
[5782.30 → 5783.88] Make Jon Snow more active and decide.
[5784.66 → 5785.02] Wow.
[5786.04 → 5787.64] Make Jersey more cunning and ruthless.
[5787.82 → 5788.94] Have her put up a better fight.
[5789.76 → 5792.08] Make the ending more coherent and satisfying.
[5792.26 → 5794.64] Have it tie up the loose ends and resolve the main conflicts and themes.
[5794.64 → 5797.66] Maybe have a different character sit on the Iron Throne or have no one sit on it at all.
[5798.30 → 5803.62] So basically, yeah, it's just taking, it's taking audience feedback and going.
[5806.14 → 5807.78] Yeah, here's what needed to be better.
[5807.88 → 5813.98] It's like, you could crowdsource how to make a you could just be like, okay.
[5816.32 → 5818.00] I love Liar.
[5820.10 → 5828.20] Can you pitch me a premise for a Jim Carrey movie that's kind of like that, but for the
[5828.20 → 5828.96] 2020s?
[5829.86 → 5830.84] Like, I don't know.
[5831.02 → 5833.54] Like, what can it, what can it not do, Luke?
[5834.86 → 5840.76] So I asked Float plane chat, based on these integrations, will you use Bing now?
[5841.00 → 5844.46] And I don't, some people criticize it because they're like, oh, we wanted a maybe or whatever.
[5844.60 → 5848.28] No, I want like, I want people that are hard facts about this.
[5848.94 → 5851.52] And so far, 80% of people are saying yes.
[5851.52 → 5851.92] Wow.
[5855.52 → 5859.30] Sickroom over in Twitch chat says, instead of rushing, it actually used the source material.
[5859.40 → 5859.60] Simple.
[5859.80 → 5860.80] There was no source material.
[5860.92 → 5861.64] That was the problem.
[5861.78 → 5862.24] That's the...
[5862.24 → 5864.30] George R.R. Martin hadn't finished the books.
[5865.28 → 5865.98] Holy crap.
[5866.08 → 5866.86] Okay, here we go.
[5867.04 → 5867.52] Here we go.
[5867.94 → 5871.80] I have not watched Liar, but I've heard it's a comedy movie where Jim Carrey plays a
[5871.80 → 5873.30] lawyer who cannot lie for 24 hours.
[5873.64 → 5877.18] Oh, that would be an interesting licensing thing for them to work out.
[5877.18 → 5881.18] How can ChatGPT watch Liar?
[5881.32 → 5881.86] You know what I mean?
[5883.92 → 5887.62] I'm surprised they haven't just trained it on it and been like, oh, we'll figure it out
[5887.62 → 5887.80] later.
[5887.90 → 5888.92] I guess if you're...
[5888.92 → 5890.62] A lot of AI stuff is like that right now.
[5890.62 → 5895.96] Unlike independent artists, though, like the MPAA, RAA, like the...
[5895.96 → 5897.20] Well, have you heard about that tool?
[5897.20 → 5907.88] Somebody made a tool that can try to reverse engineer what images that the image generator
[5907.88 → 5910.28] used in its generation of your new image.
[5911.42 → 5915.56] And then people are using that to go after the AI generators.
[5915.96 → 5919.22] And sometimes it's like, man, I'm really not sure what this would be based off of.
[5919.38 → 5923.50] And then you see the output from that thing, and it's like, whoa, it's clearly this random
[5923.50 → 5924.50] thing that I've never seen before.
[5924.50 → 5927.08] I felt like, it's interesting.
[5927.72 → 5928.70] It's very interesting.
[5929.04 → 5929.62] Oh my God.
[5929.78 → 5930.08] Okay.
[5930.34 → 5935.04] Jim Carrey plays a social media influencer who is famous for his viral videos and pranks.
[5935.34 → 5939.96] He is also a compulsive liar who exaggerates and fabricates everything about his life and
[5939.96 → 5940.48] personality.
[5941.68 → 5945.88] He has millions of followers and sponsors, but he is also unhappy and lonely.
[5946.60 → 5949.94] One day he receives a mysterious package that contains a pair of glasses.
[5950.34 → 5954.04] When he puts them on, he realizes that they are connected to his social media accounts and
[5954.04 → 5956.46] that they record and broadcast everything he sees and says.
[5956.84 → 5960.82] He also discovers that he cannot take them off and that he cannot lie or edit anything
[5960.82 → 5961.42] he posts.
[5961.66 → 5965.14] He has to face the consequences of his lies and the reactions of his fans, friends, family
[5965.14 → 5965.54] and enemies.
[5965.78 → 5969.36] He also has to find out who sent him the glasses and why and how to get rid of them.
[5969.76 → 5972.98] Along the way, he learned some valuable lessons about honesty, integrity and love.
[5972.98 → 5976.36] Whoa.
[5976.90 → 5978.54] I'd watch the shit out of that.
[5978.72 → 5978.94] Yeah.
[5979.76 → 5980.08] Probably.
[5980.20 → 5984.46] And it did just enough to go, hey, it's basically that.
[5984.54 → 5985.18] But it's newer.
[5985.34 → 5986.48] But kind of modern spin.
[5986.72 → 5987.96] It is different.
[5988.28 → 5988.50] Yeah.
[5988.94 → 5989.62] It's different.
[5989.86 → 5990.04] Yeah.
[5993.04 → 5993.60] Damn.
[5994.26 → 5994.60] Ah!
[5994.60 → 5998.64] Let's try to get this version to write an LTT episode.
[5999.20 → 6000.34] Remember, we did that, right?
[6000.62 → 6001.90] But now it should be able to search.
[6002.72 → 6006.90] Is there a video that LTT has done recently that didn't go well?
[6006.98 → 6008.20] It was controversial for some reason.
[6008.40 → 6009.18] I don't know.
[6009.60 → 6011.42] Maybe the WAN show a few weeks ago.
[6013.90 → 6015.64] Oh, man.
[6015.64 → 6022.06] I wanted to have to search for it, but I don't know.
[6022.18 → 6029.30] I've been writing a model for ChatGPT that does our sponsor segment things.
[6030.42 → 6031.84] Maybe you need to toss that now.
[6031.98 → 6032.96] Maybe I need to toss that.
[6033.02 → 6034.64] Could you have it write...
[6035.40 → 6036.26] I don't know.
[6036.40 → 6036.60] Yeah.
[6036.76 → 6037.56] It's difficult.
[6037.96 → 6038.26] This is wild.
[6038.26 → 6038.86] Well, he just did.
[6038.94 → 6040.06] He had it write the Squarespace one.
[6040.50 → 6042.92] Yeah, but I think our scripts are different.
[6042.92 → 6048.30] I wonder if there'd be a way to get it to describe a screenplay for an LTT.
[6048.58 → 6049.16] Next level.
[6049.32 → 6049.64] Hold on.
[6049.70 → 6050.12] Here we go.
[6050.26 → 6050.58] Oh, no.
[6050.68 → 6051.22] You're going to feed...
[6051.22 → 6051.64] Oh, no.
[6051.74 → 6051.92] Wait.
[6051.96 → 6055.04] You only curated nine merch messages?
[6055.94 → 6057.24] There are some potentials as well.
[6057.40 → 6057.90] Oh, okay.
[6058.20 → 6058.48] Okay.
[6058.58 → 6059.66] Let me find one of these.
[6059.76 → 6060.42] People are focused.
[6060.42 → 6068.52] I want to know what ChatGPT would answer a merch message or something like that.
[6069.32 → 6069.60] Okay.
[6070.22 → 6070.58] Okay.
[6070.86 → 6071.30] Here we go.
[6071.38 → 6072.80] Here's a good one from James D.
[6073.60 → 6079.34] If you two were to switch jobs, so us, who would give up first, and who would do more
[6079.34 → 6080.24] damage to the company?
[6080.72 → 6084.20] Like, how much could it possibly know about us?
[6084.32 → 6084.52] Yeah.
[6085.12 → 6085.48] Okay.
[6086.40 → 6098.08] If Linus Sebastian and Luc Cafetière switched jobs as a challenge, which one would give up
[6098.08 → 6106.58] first, and which would do more damage to the company in the wrong role?
[6106.58 → 6107.26] Okay.
[6109.90 → 6110.22] Okay.
[6113.82 → 6114.92] Let's see what it says.
[6116.92 → 6117.34] You know what?
[6117.38 → 6117.96] No, I'm going to read it.
[6117.96 → 6118.78] I'm going to read it to you guys.
[6118.86 → 6119.64] I'm going to read it to you guys.
[6119.78 → 6120.00] All right.
[6120.00 → 6120.18] All right.
[6120.18 → 6124.58] I have not watched their videos, but I've heard that they're both hosts of the WAN show.
[6124.68 → 6126.14] Hey, look, you got a credit for the WAN show.
[6126.26 → 6126.64] Let's go.
[6126.64 → 6128.92] And founders of Linus Tech Tips and Float play Media.
[6129.24 → 6133.04] They are both experts in technology and media, but they have different roles and skills.
[6133.54 → 6138.16] Linus is more of a creative and charismatic leader, while Luke is more of a technical and
[6138.16 → 6139.02] analytical manager.
[6139.34 → 6144.40] If they switched jobs as a challenge, I think that Linus would give up first and that Luke
[6144.40 → 6147.46] would do more damage to the company in the wrong role.
[6147.56 → 6147.80] Boom.
[6147.88 → 6148.40] Get roasted.
[6148.40 → 6153.50] Linus would give up first because he would not enjoy or excel at the tasks that Luke does,
[6153.62 → 6156.02] such as coding, troubleshooting, budgeting, and negotiating.
[6156.38 → 6159.96] He would also miss the thrill and freedom of being on camera and interacting with the
[6159.96 → 6160.32] audience.
[6160.56 → 6164.20] He would get bored and frustrated with the details and constraints of running a business,
[6164.30 → 6165.78] and he would lose his motivation and passion.
[6167.10 → 6168.06] A lot of that's probably...
[6168.06 → 6172.44] It doesn't know about Yvonne, and doesn't know that realistically she does all that stuff,
[6172.54 → 6173.42] not either of us.
[6173.42 → 6178.54] And it doesn't know that we're both stubborn as hell, and neither of us would give up.
[6179.48 → 6183.48] Luke would do more damage to the company in the wrong role because he would not be able
[6183.48 → 6187.58] to handle the pressure and expectations of being the face and voice of the company.
[6187.90 → 6196.56] He would also lack the charisma and creativity that Linus has, and he would struggle to entertain
[6196.56 → 6197.84] and engage the viewers.
[6197.84 → 6203.52] He would make some bad decisions and mistakes that would affect the quality and reputation
[6203.52 → 6207.30] of the company, and he would alienate some of the fans and sponsors.
[6207.90 → 6210.90] That is my opinion based on what I know about them.
[6211.08 → 6213.74] You may have a different opinion, and that's okay.
[6214.00 → 6215.38] What do you think of the scenario?
[6215.78 → 6216.52] That's kind of...
[6216.52 → 6217.76] Sounds pretty good to me.
[6217.76 → 6224.88] I actually had fairly similar answers, which is interesting.
[6224.90 → 6226.50] It's probably not that far off.
[6226.50 → 6227.52] Different reasons, but similar answers.
[6227.70 → 6233.14] I wouldn't call you non-charismatic, but there's no doubt that I have more experience...
[6233.14 → 6236.52] This was never what I thought I was going to do when I was growing up.
[6236.60 → 6241.00] Well, I mean, me neither, in fairness, but I definitely have more experience at it.
[6241.00 → 6248.02] But there's also way significantly higher potential for negative impact in your role.
[6249.32 → 6253.10] Honestly, in my role, AJ will keep things going.
[6253.28 → 6254.98] AJ and Jonathan will keep things alive.
[6255.42 → 6256.22] Well, that...
[6256.22 → 6258.82] I think it would take longer to screw up in my role, though.
[6259.30 → 6260.00] When I make a decision...
[6260.00 → 6260.38] I don't know.
[6261.04 → 6266.62] It's like, okay, anytime I make a big decision, it's like, we are building a lab.
[6267.18 → 6269.46] That's not going to sink us in six months.
[6269.46 → 6272.06] That could sink us in six years.
[6272.38 → 6272.70] With video content?
[6272.94 → 6276.12] What if I somehow drastically alienated the audience?
[6276.36 → 6278.48] I don't really see it happening too much, to be honest.
[6278.48 → 6280.42] I don't see it being more like a drastic alienation.
[6280.54 → 6282.66] I see it being more of like a slow decline.
[6282.96 → 6283.18] Yeah.
[6283.78 → 6284.70] I would see it that way.
[6284.76 → 6287.46] I mean, again, this is like...
[6287.46 → 6288.26] I'm not taking...
[6288.26 → 6288.88] Yeah, it's not...
[6288.88 → 6292.86] No, I'm trying to tell them, because a lot of the time I'll tell you something that I'm just like,
[6293.38 → 6294.54] yeah, bro, honestly.
[6294.84 → 6296.52] We get it, and I'm not stupid.
[6296.68 → 6296.94] Yeah.
[6297.82 → 6299.04] I'm better at it than him.
[6299.04 → 6299.46] Yeah.
[6299.46 → 6299.78] Okay?
[6300.32 → 6301.32] I would...
[6301.32 → 6302.12] Like, by a lot.
[6302.22 → 6302.94] I would...
[6302.94 → 6305.64] This is off right now, but I would f***ING hope so.
[6305.76 → 6306.00] Yeah.
[6306.10 → 6307.18] Like, for real, though.
[6307.66 → 6309.62] And that's okay.
[6309.82 → 6310.06] Yeah.
[6310.22 → 6314.52] And there's stuff that Luke is way f***ING better at than I am.
[6314.92 → 6316.52] And that's okay, too.
[6316.56 → 6316.98] It's fine.
[6316.98 → 6320.66] Like, I mean, realistically, look at the size of our hands.
[6320.66 → 6321.82] That's true.
[6324.52 → 6325.68] Who would you choose?
[6329.74 → 6330.62] Oh, my God.
[6330.62 → 6330.98] Anywho.
[6331.14 → 6332.88] I didn't think we were going that direction.
[6336.30 → 6337.30] Oh, my goodness.
[6337.30 → 6340.00] The point is, yeah, I really just don't think it's...
[6340.00 → 6341.38] I don't think it's that far off.
[6341.54 → 6341.68] No.
[6341.82 → 6343.30] And it's reasoning...
[6343.30 → 6344.40] It's not that stupid.
[6344.40 → 6344.86] ...makes sense.
[6345.32 → 6345.64] Yeah.
[6345.64 → 6352.22] With the amount of information that it was able to drag up, that was, like, a pretty logical
[6352.22 → 6353.44] conclusion for it to come to.
[6353.54 → 6355.68] I mean, obviously, there's little things that are...
[6355.68 → 6356.70] It's missing context, for sure.
[6356.70 → 6358.02] Yeah, that are not quite right.
[6358.04 → 6360.96] Like you said, it didn't understand Yvonne's involvement.
[6361.08 → 6363.34] It didn't understand the involvement of tons of other people at the company.
[6363.38 → 6365.96] I don't mind negotiating, but how would it know that?
[6366.38 → 6367.78] Actually, I mean, I don't like it.
[6367.84 → 6369.86] I'm good at it, but I don't really like it.
[6369.94 → 6371.16] I hate it.
[6371.56 → 6372.68] Yeah, you're perfect at it, though.
[6373.00 → 6374.26] But I tend to win.
[6374.26 → 6376.90] You're the cheapest f***ING bastard I have ever met.
[6377.38 → 6379.14] You can't talk about the recent one.
[6379.34 → 6383.58] Find a spouse who spends your money the way Luke spends mine.
[6387.32 → 6391.78] Yeah, I don't like doing it, but if I'm going to have to do it, I'm in.
[6392.10 → 6392.94] It's optimal.
[6393.50 → 6395.02] Let's mid-max this!
[6396.08 → 6397.20] Yeah, pretty much.
[6398.34 → 6399.54] I don't...
[6399.54 → 6399.78] Yeah.
[6400.06 → 6400.32] Yep.
[6400.90 → 6401.32] I don't know.
[6401.88 → 6403.94] Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm archiving that.
[6403.94 → 6405.80] Yep, that's a good enough answer.
[6408.86 → 6417.46] It's interesting, too, how it inferred quite a bit off of not that much information, but it did it pretty well, right?
[6418.10 → 6418.76] I don't know.
[6419.40 → 6419.72] Hey!
[6420.54 → 6422.46] Guess who just sent in a chat?
[6422.46 → 6425.28] It's good old Christopher L.
[6425.42 → 6426.82] Hey, Linus.
[6427.24 → 6429.36] Thanks for almost hiring me instead of Luke.
[6429.64 → 6432.18] In all seriousness, so happy to see what LMG has become.
[6432.62 → 6436.20] Tell me your favourite memory of working with me at NCI Tech Tips.
[6437.04 → 6437.40] Wheels.
[6438.52 → 6438.96] Okay.
[6439.12 → 6439.32] Wow.
[6439.32 → 6446.94] If that's actually you, which I think it probably is, because most people don't know that he applied at the same time as you.
[6447.98 → 6449.14] Oh, yeah, yeah, I know that makes sense.
[6449.22 → 6449.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6449.48 → 6450.92] Yeah, like only a few people would know that.
[6450.92 → 6452.90] I didn't really understand, but that makes sense.
[6452.90 → 6454.46] He was a close...
[6454.46 → 6455.98] It was either second or third.
[6455.98 → 6465.06] He almost had the job, and it was only down to just how well you and I got along that it ultimately went to you.
[6465.84 → 6467.22] And he was brought on later on.
[6467.22 → 6476.76] And he did end up getting brought in by the NCI Tech Tips team, and he actually ran it for a while until, I mean, well, you know, things started to completely disintegrate.
[6476.78 → 6477.38] Something happened there, yeah.
[6477.38 → 6478.22] Yeah, exactly.
[6479.34 → 6480.56] And he did a great job.
[6481.00 → 6485.70] So, like, I kind of couldn't have gone wrong, but, man, favourite memory.
[6486.94 → 6487.34] Oh.
[6488.78 → 6504.64] It's less like anything specific, but I will say that there was definitely some tense time studio sharing in that, remember the tiny little room that was in the top of the new headquarters right around the time that we left?
[6504.72 → 6504.84] Yeah.
[6504.84 → 6509.54] That tiny little room that all of us were supposed to be working out of.
[6509.54 → 6516.68] And then the way that they expanded into that nearby room that was just, like, completely packed floor to ceiling with tech.
[6517.20 → 6520.26] Like, that was such an incredible era.
[6520.26 → 6520.34] Yeah.
[6520.98 → 6528.08] Um, if I had to pick anything, I would say shooting the cardboard box challenge.
[6528.92 → 6531.92] I don't even remember why that video existed.
[6531.92 → 6536.30] There are a lot of videos from back then that are, you know.
[6537.70 → 6539.58] Linus cardboard armour.
[6539.98 → 6542.20] Like, I don't even know if I'm going to be able to find this.
[6542.20 → 6547.02] But we basically built ourselves, like, box armour.
[6547.50 → 6549.20] I don't know why.
[6549.74 → 6553.70] And we, like, fought with it in slow motion or something.
[6554.52 → 6556.14] Ah, NCI maybe.
[6556.30 → 6558.20] Like, where did that video end up?
[6559.08 → 6560.36] I have no idea.
[6560.50 → 6561.12] Yeah, here we go.
[6561.54 → 6563.70] Massive giveaway and fight to the death.
[6563.70 → 6569.82] I don't know why we did this.
[6571.10 → 6571.50] Whoa!
[6572.80 → 6573.62] Sorry, sorry.
[6573.76 → 6574.50] I need to mute this.
[6574.96 → 6575.66] But, but.
[6575.94 → 6576.64] No, no, we're good.
[6576.68 → 6577.68] We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[6578.58 → 6579.16] Hey, man.
[6579.26 → 6580.36] We're getting better, right?
[6580.38 → 6581.14] Hey, there's Chris.
[6581.76 → 6583.24] Don't you remember what you were like when you started?
[6585.06 → 6585.46] Hi.
[6585.68 → 6587.12] Welcome to NCI Tech Tips.
[6587.12 → 6591.34] My name is Linus Sebastian, and today we'll be looking at the Sunbeam Tech Tunic Tower.
[6593.70 → 6597.12] I remember being amazing in every way.
[6597.82 → 6598.66] I remember.
[6598.66 → 6599.34] Why is he acting?
[6599.36 → 6600.36] Besides, I think we're improving.
[6600.66 → 6601.02] All right.
[6601.62 → 6603.74] All right, little upstart smart guy.
[6604.40 → 6604.78] Tell you what.
[6605.50 → 6606.08] How about this?
[6606.92 → 6610.10] My team versus your team, battle to the death.
[6610.92 → 6613.88] The winner is the best tech YouTube channel.
[6614.48 → 6617.50] Okay, I want to make it really clear I did not write this.
[6618.08 → 6618.36] Okay?
[6618.80 → 6619.34] Yeah, what?
[6619.34 → 6622.50] I mean, look, it was, okay, you know what?
[6622.56 → 6623.34] Challenge accepted.
[6623.70 → 6624.70] I don't remember this at all.
[6624.86 → 6625.22] Riley.
[6626.10 → 6626.88] Here's your banana.
[6627.42 → 6627.88] Young Riley.
[6627.88 → 6628.82] I don't need it anymore.
[6630.50 → 6632.16] Actually, I'm going to make a phone call.
[6633.76 → 6634.92] Are you kidding me?
[6636.10 → 6636.46] Hello?
[6636.68 → 6637.44] Hey, Luke.
[6637.52 → 6638.16] I'm in this?
[6638.26 → 6639.28] I don't remember this at all.
[6639.46 → 6639.64] What?
[6639.72 → 6639.88] Really?
[6639.94 → 6641.34] Come to NCI right now.
[6641.86 → 6644.60] Did you challenge a group of people to a fight to the death again?
[6646.74 → 6647.10] Maybe.
[6647.10 → 6648.94] I mean, it doesn't really matter.
[6649.28 → 6650.10] Okay, mister.
[6650.18 → 6652.18] I have zero memory of this.
[6652.18 → 6652.56] Oh, no.
[6652.62 → 6653.44] Mine's terrible, too.
[6653.72 → 6654.48] Mine's terrible, too.
[6654.76 → 6655.20] Let's, let's.
[6655.36 → 6656.74] I'm 100% off.
[6656.94 → 6658.90] I think the only good thing I've ever done.
[6658.90 → 6659.24] Right now.
[6659.44 → 6659.74] Come here.
[6659.98 → 6660.68] No, no.
[6660.80 → 6661.36] I'm working.
[6661.52 → 6662.02] Ask Easel.
[6662.02 → 6667.32] I think the only good thing I've ever done was like the when I grabbed the orange and
[6667.32 → 6668.06] burned my hand.
[6668.24 → 6669.80] Oh, that was pretty good for that funk commercial.
[6669.80 → 6671.00] That's like the only thing.
[6672.32 → 6672.72] Fine.
[6672.90 → 6673.50] Be like that.
[6676.14 → 6676.54] You?
[6676.54 → 6676.60] You?
[6676.60 → 6684.28] Looks like I'm going to have to do this myself.
[6685.52 → 6686.96] Wait, I do remember this now.
[6687.62 → 6690.56] Because you get like knocked over, and then they like to pretend to beat you up or something,
[6690.68 → 6690.78] right?
[6691.82 → 6693.00] Oh, my goodness.
[6693.28 → 6697.42] So, there's a montage here where we like create box armour and then.
[6699.00 → 6699.44] Yeah.
[6699.82 → 6700.56] The old helmet.
[6700.56 → 6706.22] Why did we do this?
[6706.30 → 6706.58] Yeah, but.
[6706.92 → 6707.10] Yeah.
[6710.00 → 6710.44] Expel levant!
[6711.22 → 6712.64] Why do I shout that?
[6713.42 → 6715.06] Why do I have a lightsabre?
[6717.50 → 6717.90] Okay.
[6717.98 → 6720.06] I think that's probably quite enough of that.
[6720.72 → 6721.10] Anywho.
[6721.82 → 6723.18] That was a lot of fun.
[6724.36 → 6725.84] In a lot of ways, man.
[6725.92 → 6727.26] What we do now is so professional.
[6727.26 → 6730.10] But what we did back then where it was more.
[6730.28 → 6731.86] Well, I shouldn't even say that.
[6731.92 → 6733.76] We did some pretty cringe stuff today.
[6734.14 → 6734.66] Okay.
[6734.80 → 6735.12] Hold on.
[6735.18 → 6736.46] Well, the production values are better.
[6736.66 → 6741.24] But I think probably the most fun thing about this job then, whether it's then or now,
[6741.36 → 6743.52] is the fact that we get paid.
[6743.76 → 6751.26] So, we get paid professionally to produce content that realistically has about the writing and
[6751.26 → 6754.98] planning of like a grade 10 high school media class project, you know?
[6754.98 → 6756.26] So, we...
[6756.26 → 6759.70] I feel like a grade school, high school media class project would probably have more time.
[6760.88 → 6761.36] No, no.
[6761.40 → 6762.50] Not anymore.
[6763.06 → 6765.90] Like, where writers are only responsible for like one a week.
[6766.04 → 6766.28] Okay.
[6766.32 → 6766.66] Fair enough.
[6766.74 → 6766.90] Yeah.
[6766.94 → 6769.22] We have like 12 editors now and all that kind of stuff.
[6769.28 → 6769.42] Yeah.
[6769.44 → 6771.44] We actually like have time to work on things now.
[6771.44 → 6771.48] Okay.
[6771.48 → 6771.62] Okay.
[6772.36 → 6776.50] But sometimes, you know, it's...
[6776.50 → 6780.88] But it's that same kind of inspiration where even if we are putting more work into it, like,
[6780.94 → 6785.12] okay, there's a really cool bit from an upcoming video.
[6785.34 → 6785.52] It's good.
[6785.56 → 6787.28] This is going to come up this weekend.
[6788.18 → 6788.80] Oh, shoot.
[6789.36 → 6791.66] Is it not live on float plane yet?
[6792.72 → 6795.56] Oh, I don't have a way to get this unless I'm logged into Trello.
[6795.66 → 6796.60] I'm not logged into Trello here.
[6796.66 → 6797.12] It doesn't matter.
[6797.12 → 6803.70] The point is we do a bit where I have a Raspberry Pi and I go and I throw it over my shoulder
[6803.70 → 6806.78] and it like explodes when it lands and then another one explodes.
[6807.00 → 6810.70] And then the things that come out of the explosions are cool things you can do with the Raspberry Pi.
[6810.96 → 6812.84] So I'm like, it's a chain reaction of innovation.
[6812.96 → 6816.28] And it shows like a media server and like some cool stuff.
[6818.00 → 6823.02] That's exactly the kind of thing that a bunch of high school kids would come up with,
[6823.16 → 6824.78] except now we have production values.
[6824.78 → 6830.00] And I think it's those kinds of projects that are the ones that stick with you years later.
[6830.36 → 6830.54] Yeah.
[6830.86 → 6831.08] Yeah.
[6831.24 → 6831.68] A hundred percent.
[6833.82 → 6834.32] All right.
[6834.58 → 6837.64] Should we do a couple more merch messages, and then we'll move on to some more topics?
[6838.00 → 6838.32] Probably.
[6838.58 → 6838.80] All right.
[6838.84 → 6839.38] Hit us, Dan.
[6840.16 → 6840.48] Okay.
[6840.68 → 6842.46] I've got a few here for you.
[6842.46 → 6842.66] Oh, yeah.
[6842.68 → 6844.70] And I need to tell XQC that he owes me 10 grand.
[6845.72 → 6846.44] It's 10 grand.
[6846.68 → 6847.02] Oh, sorry.
[6847.10 → 6847.28] Sorry.
[6847.40 → 6847.92] A grand.
[6848.26 → 6849.10] I wish it was 10 grand.
[6849.16 → 6850.04] I should have bet him 10 grand.
[6850.20 → 6851.12] I heard he's a gambler.
[6851.44 → 6852.02] He is.
[6852.02 → 6857.82] I probably could have made a lot more money based on knowing that ChatGPT was coming.
[6858.14 → 6858.28] Yeah.
[6859.06 → 6861.62] I also think I cut my hand open on his motherboard, but whatever.
[6862.10 → 6862.58] Are you okay?
[6862.74 → 6863.00] Yes.
[6863.36 → 6864.26] Did you file a report?
[6864.50 → 6864.76] Yes.
[6865.04 → 6866.24] This one's from David.
[6866.46 → 6867.66] No, it was just a little tiny scratch.
[6868.12 → 6869.40] Did it bleed?
[6869.58 → 6869.76] No.
[6869.76 → 6870.36] No, no, no.
[6870.68 → 6871.62] This is from David.
[6874.10 → 6875.96] Luke, have you ever enjoyed hosting again?
[6875.96 → 6880.96] And when your team gets back in full capacity, will we see more of you on the main channel
[6880.96 → 6881.72] and tech linked?
[6882.06 → 6883.00] Did it say have I ever?
[6883.22 → 6883.68] Is that actually?
[6883.82 → 6885.08] Have you enjoyed hosting again?
[6885.30 → 6887.02] Oh, yeah.
[6888.28 → 6892.62] When your team gets back to full capacity is a very astute observation.
[6893.38 → 6897.70] I can basically say I won't really be hosting much in the near future.
[6897.70 → 6904.78] Maybe a little bit to do with this AMD graphics card thing we're doing, but I am freaking slammed
[6904.78 → 6909.96] right now because of some things that are going on.
[6912.76 → 6915.76] But, yeah, once that gets resolved, maybe something here or there.
[6915.82 → 6916.16] I don't know.
[6916.24 → 6918.78] It's never going to be a lot or consistent again.
[6918.98 → 6919.98] I do too many other things.
[6919.98 → 6923.52] But it's been fun coming in every once in a while and doing whatever.
[6924.92 → 6925.02] Yeah.
[6925.14 → 6925.44] All right.
[6925.52 → 6925.86] One more.
[6927.22 → 6927.54] Okay.
[6927.90 → 6928.80] This is from Matthew.
[6929.10 → 6929.80] Tracksuit gang.
[6930.02 → 6933.72] My wife wants to know what insights you gained from the women's merch survey.
[6933.88 → 6935.06] Is there anything you can share?
[6936.78 → 6939.96] I wish we could just ask big women be complicated.
[6940.30 → 6941.14] That makes sense.
[6941.68 → 6943.16] They agreed on nothing.
[6943.58 → 6943.78] Yep.
[6943.78 → 6950.16] Like there was no consensus in terms of size, preferences.
[6951.90 → 6952.98] Just, oh, man.
[6953.38 → 6958.94] Basically, as far as I can tell, for us to satisfy the women in our audience,
[6961.52 → 6966.98] we would have to have, you know, four times the product offering.
[6966.98 → 6974.58] And it would be applicable to maybe 5% of the total potential.
[6974.88 → 6977.90] I think on average they are much more complicated shapes.
[6978.70 → 6979.74] Oh, for sure.
[6979.90 → 6980.06] Right.
[6980.20 → 6983.30] Like a lot of guys are very like just boxy frame, right?
[6983.46 → 6983.70] Yeah.
[6983.98 → 6984.18] Yeah.
[6984.28 → 6984.52] So.
[6984.84 → 6989.34] It's basically a box or a box with a bulge sticking out of the front of it.
[6989.58 → 6989.74] Yeah.
[6989.82 → 6992.24] Like it's like realistically, right?
[6992.24 → 6996.94] It's a lot less complicated to make general designs for average male shapes.
[6996.94 → 7002.12] And men don't expect things to fit as tightly, you know?
[7002.12 → 7002.28] Yeah.
[7002.28 → 7003.46] Like it's just, it's a different.
[7003.84 → 7004.54] That makes sense to you.
[7004.54 → 7008.74] Like honestly, some of our early garments, looking back on them, they weren't that great.
[7009.56 → 7016.18] They were probably the best thing like a dude who's just only ever shopped at Walmart has ever put on.
[7017.10 → 7020.34] But I think the standards are a little bit different.
[7020.34 → 7021.46] Yeah.
[7021.92 → 7022.36] Yeah.
[7022.68 → 7024.30] Like just your average tech bro.
[7024.60 → 7025.50] It's like, wow.
[7026.34 → 7026.92] This is like.
[7027.04 → 7027.68] This is pretty good.
[7027.74 → 7028.24] Not s***.
[7028.44 → 7030.54] This is better than every like trade show shirt I've gotten.
[7032.58 → 7033.02] Huh.
[7033.52 → 7034.66] Spending money works.
[7039.00 → 7040.76] I'm not trying to generalize or whatever.
[7040.98 → 7043.56] The reality is that's the world I came from, right?
[7043.62 → 7043.92] Me too.
[7043.94 → 7045.16] So I was like, these are great.
[7045.54 → 7045.66] Yeah.
[7045.86 → 7046.06] Yeah.
[7046.12 → 7048.44] And like obviously we continue to try and do better.
[7048.60 → 7050.26] But that was where we started, right?
[7050.26 → 7050.48] Yeah.
[7051.48 → 7051.84] Okay.
[7052.92 → 7054.56] Let's move on to another topic.
[7054.62 → 7055.32] What do you want to talk about?
[7056.86 → 7057.68] Let's see.
[7057.68 → 7065.20] I want to talk about new Chinese phones loaded with malware and also non-Chinese phones loaded
[7065.20 → 7068.94] up with seemingly unnecessary amounts of software.
[7069.74 → 7074.50] So a study has found that new Android phones are being sold with spyware embedded in the
[7074.50 → 7078.06] OS and pre-installed apps in China, which is a massive shocker.
[7078.06 → 7083.72] Popular phone vendors like OnePlus, Opp, Realm, and Xiaomi, as well as network providers and
[7083.72 → 7088.30] services like Baidu are collecting huge amounts of sensitive personal information from users.
[7088.98 → 7089.90] And this is wild.
[7090.12 → 7094.46] The devices continue transmitting data even when they leave the country or when the SIM card
[7094.46 → 7095.50] isn't installed.
[7095.94 → 7096.10] Yeah.
[7096.10 → 7096.16] Yeah.
[7097.38 → 7100.66] The private sector in China typically has a close relationship with the government, which
[7100.66 → 7102.60] raises concerns about broader surveillance.
[7103.08 → 7103.56] Yeah.
[7104.10 → 7105.84] So that's pretty wild.
[7106.28 → 7109.08] I'm wondering what the SIM card not installed thing like.
[7109.16 → 7109.32] Are they...
[7109.32 → 7113.32] Do they have some like shadow eSIM thing going on?
[7113.36 → 7114.74] Or are they talking just over Wi-Fi?
[7114.74 → 7117.60] You can place an emergency call when you don't have a SIM card in.
[7118.02 → 7120.24] So I've always just kind of assumed that the SIM...
[7120.24 → 7121.22] There's a way.
[7121.44 → 7121.54] Yeah.
[7121.60 → 7126.16] I don't actually know a ton about exactly how mobile network authentication works.
[7126.32 → 7127.08] I've just...
[7127.08 → 7128.22] I've never had a reason to look into it.
[7128.22 → 7130.36] I believe there's a bypass for emergency calls.
[7130.48 → 7130.92] Well, there is.
[7131.12 → 7131.28] Yeah.
[7131.30 → 7133.28] You can have no SIM in your thing, and you can definitely place...
[7133.28 → 7135.32] I know for a fact you can make an emergency call.
[7135.48 → 7137.94] So who operates that network that your calls carry?
[7138.06 → 7139.00] I don't know.
[7139.00 → 7146.86] But the point is that it's obvious to me that you absolutely can do stuff.
[7147.14 → 7148.22] I think there's some...
[7148.22 → 7148.40] Yeah.
[7148.54 → 7153.02] I don't know, but I'm pretty sure there's like an agreement with all telcos, at least in
[7153.02 → 7156.08] North America, where you have to service that call if you're the nearest tower.
[7156.36 → 7156.60] Sure.
[7156.80 → 7157.46] Yeah, that makes sense.
[7157.60 → 7157.74] Yeah.
[7158.14 → 7158.92] It doesn't matter.
[7159.02 → 7159.68] Nothing gets charged.
[7159.78 → 7161.26] It's just something you have to do.
[7161.42 → 7168.98] In more surprising news, Samsung's Galaxy S23 series phones are coming packed with
[7169.00 → 7176.20] I kid you not, 55 gigabytes of uninstallable bloatware.
[7177.54 → 7178.72] Uninstallable part.
[7178.72 → 7179.02] Uninstallable.
[7179.12 → 7180.16] No, no, it's uninstallable.
[7180.26 → 7180.60] Oh.
[7181.14 → 7187.58] For comparison, the system partition is only 15 gigabytes on the Pixel 7, which contains
[7187.58 → 7192.80] two copies of Android, one redundant copy for the sake of background OS updates.
[7194.00 → 7195.72] Oh, this is an interesting note.
[7195.72 → 7200.86] Samsung is the only major OEM to not use this two OS system.
[7201.38 → 7206.62] The massive storage partition of the S23, then, is probably due to inefficient code and
[7206.62 → 7210.16] the fact that Samsung is both contractually obligated to install a suite of Google apps
[7210.16 → 7217.00] and also insists on installing their own suite of store brand clones for those apps for the
[7217.00 → 7219.02] sake of looking like they have their own thriving ecosystem.
[7220.62 → 7224.16] Oh, for the sake of looking like they have their own thriving ecosystem, Samsung likewise
[7224.16 → 7227.52] auctions off space in the partition to other companies and apps.
[7228.64 → 7228.98] Whew.
[7229.52 → 7229.98] Okay.
[7230.64 → 7236.44] So I guess we're supposed to look at this phone, which is apparently untouched, and we're
[7236.44 → 7239.34] supposed to evaluate how much crap is on it.
[7239.34 → 7241.08] So Dan's not here.
[7241.84 → 7243.20] So Dan?
[7243.94 → 7244.24] Oh.
[7245.30 → 7246.08] Not now.
[7246.70 → 7247.04] Bye.
[7248.30 → 7248.74] Dan?
[7250.34 → 7250.78] Oh.
[7250.92 → 7252.14] Oh, I heard back from XQC.
[7252.68 → 7254.10] I said, it's here.
[7254.68 → 7255.98] I think you owe me a grand.
[7256.40 → 7259.88] Maybe do a stream reacting to the ChatGPT being part of the latest WAN show.
[7259.96 → 7260.90] He says, will do.
[7261.06 → 7262.78] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[7263.14 → 7264.14] Ha ha ha ha.
[7264.38 → 7264.78] Nice.
[7264.98 → 7265.20] Perfect.
[7265.48 → 7265.70] All right.
[7265.86 → 7267.34] Hey, Dan, can I get a close up, please?
[7267.72 → 7268.26] Close up.
[7268.26 → 7269.24] Uh, on Luke.
[7269.88 → 7270.12] Luke.
[7270.12 → 7271.50] Because that seems closer.
[7271.80 → 7272.72] Oh, okay.
[7272.90 → 7273.94] Well, um, sure.
[7274.10 → 7274.94] Yeah, that'll, that'll do.
[7275.64 → 7278.32] So there's, this is weird.
[7278.52 → 7279.72] There's not that much on here.
[7280.26 → 7281.12] There's Google apps.
[7282.20 → 7283.60] There's a handful.
[7283.84 → 7285.56] Oh, way to go, Dan.
[7285.90 → 7288.68] Uh, there's like small handful of Samsung apps.
[7288.98 → 7290.66] So then, oh, wow.
[7290.70 → 7292.06] I like our battery percentage though.
[7292.42 → 7292.68] Nice.
[7292.98 → 7294.02] Oh, no, Dan.
[7294.22 → 7294.58] Oh my.
[7294.90 → 7296.18] What's going on, Dan?
[7296.46 → 7296.90] Okay.
[7296.90 → 7298.44] And then, so what?
[7298.52 → 7300.02] Is, is the storage even full?
[7300.02 → 7300.56] You can go to storage.
[7301.58 → 7302.02] It's, what?
[7302.74 → 7304.88] What the f***?
[7305.60 → 7306.58] It just says it's good?
[7306.94 → 7309.38] No, there are 55 gigabytes consumed.
[7310.52 → 7312.22] There's nothing on here.
[7313.40 → 7314.16] That's it.
[7314.16 → 7316.22] What?
[7316.22 → 7317.90] How is that even possible?
[7318.22 → 7318.92] Is, hmm.
[7319.72 → 7320.28] Hmm.
[7320.84 → 7322.16] What's going on in those folders?
[7322.66 → 7323.58] Is there like hidden stuff?
[7324.44 → 7326.68] Google, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, and YouTube.
[7326.80 → 7328.40] Where's the Samsung proprietary stuff?
[7328.50 → 7330.92] Bixby, Messages, and My Files.
[7331.36 → 7331.68] Hmm.
[7333.76 → 7334.00] Hmm.
[7334.22 → 7335.82] They've even got OneDrive on here.
[7337.00 → 7337.14] And they,
[7337.14 → 7340.24] That's it?
[7340.52 → 7341.26] There is everything.
[7341.72 → 7342.20] Yeah, what?
[7342.56 → 7342.92] Okay, so.
[7343.04 → 7344.26] Can you go into that internal storage
[7344.26 → 7345.76] and figure out like what it all is?
[7345.78 → 7347.12] Hold on just a gosh darn minute here.
[7347.38 → 7348.02] Yeah, there we go.
[7348.18 → 7348.56] System.
[7350.56 → 7352.06] 55.22 gigs.
[7354.64 → 7355.04] Okay.
[7355.24 → 7357.66] I kind of assumed that the bloat
[7357.66 → 7359.92] was going to be just a ton of apps.
[7360.16 → 7360.52] Me too.
[7361.02 → 7362.34] I mean, that's what the notes said.
[7362.34 → 7362.72] We're good, Dan.
[7363.32 → 7364.98] I didn't think it was,
[7365.08 → 7367.02] I didn't think it was going to be just.
[7368.70 → 7370.84] It said they're uninstallable.
[7371.10 → 7372.36] Can you go to uninstallable programs?
[7372.52 → 7374.36] No, it must be uninstallable then.
[7374.94 → 7376.64] I think that might have just been a typo.
[7377.92 → 7379.76] That is mind-boggling.
[7380.78 → 7382.66] So our discussion question here then.
[7382.66 → 7384.60] Oh, check the apps section in settings
[7384.60 → 7386.10] and see for disabled apps.
[7386.82 → 7387.22] Interesting.
[7388.16 → 7390.16] That's from Brando in Flow play chat.
[7391.02 → 7391.42] Okay.
[7391.42 → 7394.66] Well, I'm into...
[7394.66 → 7396.62] Handyman in chat is saying that
[7396.62 → 7397.42] it's because of
[7399.10 → 7402.46] GB versus GIB
[7402.46 → 7404.70] and tech journalists don't know anything.
[7405.02 → 7405.50] Gigabit?
[7406.42 → 7407.86] No, these are big bytes.
[7408.46 → 7408.70] Are you sure?
[7408.70 → 7410.54] And it also says 55 used,
[7410.66 → 7412.92] which is 10% of a 512 gig phone.
[7413.36 → 7414.10] So no.
[7414.76 → 7416.24] That's just definitely not right.
[7417.16 → 7417.52] All right.
[7417.52 → 7420.40] Go to uninstall and current status of apps and stuff.
[7420.40 → 7422.42] Look for disabled apps
[7422.42 → 7424.56] and what apps it lets you uninstall.
[7425.32 → 7425.72] Sure.
[7425.80 → 7427.06] Because I feel like things are hidden.
[7427.70 → 7427.94] Yeah.
[7428.06 → 7428.22] Yeah.
[7428.30 → 7429.60] That could very well be.
[7433.60 → 7434.56] Reset app preferences.
[7435.40 → 7435.64] Dude, there's...
[7436.64 → 7436.68] Sorry.
[7436.82 → 7437.64] I'm just...
[7437.64 → 7438.60] Here, we'll go back to...
[7438.60 → 7438.96] There's nothing?
[7439.10 → 7439.88] Go back to the Loot Cam.
[7440.14 → 7440.42] No, no.
[7440.42 → 7440.90] It's good enough, Dan.
[7440.92 → 7441.28] It's good enough.
[7441.70 → 7442.96] There's nothing in here.
[7444.04 → 7444.50] That's it.
[7444.50 → 7445.62] That's really not a lot.
[7445.76 → 7446.08] No.
[7446.30 → 7448.76] AR emoji is 172 kilobytes,
[7448.88 → 7451.60] like dictionary, 4.1 kilobytes.
[7452.14 → 7454.88] Nothing in here is over 10 legs.
[7455.88 → 7457.60] Handyman, just link the article, my dude.
[7458.44 → 7459.62] That's mind-blowing.
[7459.62 → 7465.10] And, you know, what's funny is I was actually about to buy one of these.
[7465.32 → 7466.40] Yvonne needs a new phone,
[7466.88 → 7471.48] and I need something with dual SIM and something that's Android.
[7471.66 → 7473.00] She's got a handful of requirements.
[7473.00 → 7473.62] Essential question for you.
[7473.98 → 7474.74] Does it matter?
[7475.76 → 7476.14] Well...
[7476.14 → 7477.00] There are 512 gigs on there.
[7477.06 → 7478.76] You have over 400 gigs of storage.
[7478.94 → 7481.94] Right, but not every SKU has 512 gigs of storage in it.
[7482.40 → 7484.62] So, like, if you have a lower storage version...
[7484.62 → 7487.40] What's the lowest storage of the S23?
[7487.74 → 7488.56] Let's have a look.
[7488.72 → 7489.84] Galaxy S23, yeah.
[7490.02 → 7490.42] S23.
[7490.74 → 7494.44] Is it possible some of it is, like, reserved space?
[7494.60 → 7497.12] Like, I'm talking, like, swap file style.
[7497.12 → 7497.82] Like, I don't...
[7497.82 → 7500.32] Again, this is something I've just never really needed to look into.
[7500.58 → 7504.28] Is there any reason for them to have some reserved space?
[7504.64 → 7506.20] Because I could see that being part of it.
[7507.14 → 7507.22] 128?
[7508.06 → 7508.40] No.
[7508.72 → 7509.32] Wait, hold on.
[7509.36 → 7509.76] I'm going to check.
[7509.82 → 7510.46] No, it's 256.
[7510.46 → 7517.46] So, if you're talking about a fifth of your capacity being taken up...
[7517.46 → 7521.26] By just an utterly bloated operating system...
[7521.26 → 7522.04] That's ridiculous.
[7523.14 → 7525.86] And even if you are talking about a tenth of it...
[7525.86 → 7528.02] Even if I do have 90% of my storage...
[7528.02 → 7528.94] Why is that good enough?
[7529.80 → 7530.68] Well, okay.
[7530.82 → 7531.42] Hold on a second.
[7531.52 → 7533.40] I mean, with how much space Windows takes up...
[7533.40 → 7536.20] Especially when solid-state drives were...
[7536.20 → 7539.46] First coming to prominence in mobile Windows-based laptops...
[7540.46 → 7543.80] You know, Windows would take up a substantial amount of your boot drive.
[7543.86 → 7547.46] Like, if you bought a system with 128 gigs or 256 gigs...
[7547.98 → 7548.46] That was...
[7548.46 → 7549.68] It was significant.
[7550.88 → 7552.50] Yeah, that's tough.
[7553.28 → 7554.50] So, how do you...
[7554.50 → 7555.86] Yeah, this article is saying...
[7555.86 → 7558.46] So, this is an article from notebookcheck.net...
[7558.46 → 7558.68] Yeah.
[7558.76 → 7560.46] ...saying, if these accusations are true...
[7560.46 → 7563.46] The Galaxy S models with 128 gigabytes of storage...
[7563.46 → 7567.46] Would offer just over 50% capacity for user data and apps...
[7567.46 → 7571.46] Checking on a 128 gigabyte version of the Galaxy S22 Ultra...
[7572.24 → 7573.74] Reveals that this is not the case.
[7574.12 → 7575.64] If the screenshot below shows...
[7575.64 → 7580.12] The device reserves 26.09 gigabytes for system.
[7580.12 → 7583.88] Is it reserving some space just for, like, wear levelling on the SSD?
[7584.22 → 7586.92] That's the most plausible explanation that I can think of.
[7587.12 → 7590.52] Conversely, a 512 gigabyte version of the S23 Ultra...
[7590.52 → 7592.94] Uses 55.23 gigabytes for system.
[7593.02 → 7596.12] That would also explain why the S23...
[7596.80 → 7599.04] So, people are just posting their Samsung phones...
[7599.04 → 7600.74] And how much space system is taking up.
[7600.78 → 7604.30] So, like, 128 gig ones are more like 25 gigs.
[7604.38 → 7605.30] Like, half the size.
[7605.30 → 7607.86] And, you know what?
[7607.96 → 7609.72] It would kind of make sense...
[7609.72 → 7612.10] For it to not scale linearly with storage...
[7612.10 → 7613.62] If it was for wear levelling...
[7613.62 → 7614.92] Like, if it was for...
[7614.92 → 7617.70] Like, increasing the longevity of the SSD...
[7617.70 → 7619.30] Because the bigger the SSD...
[7620.02 → 7621.34] The less...
[7621.34 → 7623.08] The total capacity of it...
[7623.08 → 7624.30] Is likely to be written...
[7624.96 → 7628.08] And the less of spare area you need to allocate...
[7628.08 → 7629.30] In order to extend its life...
[7629.92 → 7631.72] If that's what they're doing...
[7631.72 → 7633.08] I'm super okay with it.
[7633.14 → 7634.14] Like, I'm the kind of person...
[7634.14 → 7636.00] Who has my phone set to only charge...
[7636.00 → 7637.32] To 85% every night.
[7637.56 → 7640.32] So that it is never sitting at 100% charge.
[7640.38 → 7641.42] And then I try to grab it...
[7641.42 → 7643.06] Before it manages to reach zero.
[7644.62 → 7645.38] But...
[7645.38 → 7646.68] A lot of people here are saying...
[7646.68 → 7647.84] No, it's definitely hidden apps.
[7647.88 → 7649.96] I think this is absolutely a developing story.
[7650.04 → 7652.56] And we don't want to...
[7652.56 → 7653.84] Oh, apparently, yes...
[7653.84 → 7656.22] They do allocate some space for wear levelling...
[7656.22 → 7657.60] But it's not part of the 55.
[7657.64 → 7658.58] Yeah, people are saying...
[7658.58 → 7660.66] That it's not reported in that section.
[7660.66 → 7664.66] Oh, this is not good.
[7666.16 → 7666.98] Not cool.
[7668.20 → 7671.06] Man, Samsung doesn't need more controversy right now.
[7671.20 → 7674.72] With the dying SSDs that they've got going on right now.
[7674.98 → 7676.12] And it's generally...
[7676.12 → 7677.00] The batteries back in the day.
[7677.08 → 7677.82] Being Samsung.
[7678.30 → 7678.48] Yeah.
[7679.34 → 7680.50] I'm sure they've done something wrong.
[7682.78 → 7683.22] Huh.
[7683.62 → 7684.34] It's interesting.
[7684.34 → 7687.56] Well, why don't we talk about the...
[7687.56 → 7690.76] Why don't we talk about the trip down to Los Angeles...
[7690.76 → 7691.94] And the collab with XQC?
[7692.36 → 7692.60] Yeah.
[7694.48 → 7696.34] I have a new favourite...
[7697.16 → 7700.46] Totally deranged gad zillionaire story.
[7701.84 → 7702.34] So...
[7702.88 → 7705.34] My old favourite one was...
[7706.34 → 7709.50] It was to do with Mr. Beast's production process.
[7709.80 → 7711.50] That was my favourite story to tell.
[7711.50 → 7713.68] Just like...
[7713.68 → 7718.74] The guy's so laser focused on just like productivity and like maximizing his day.
[7718.94 → 7720.22] There's some pretty...
[7720.22 → 7723.50] There's some pretty sort of mind-blowing to me.
[7724.06 → 7727.50] Who, you know, people have been telling me I should have an assistant for...
[7728.80 → 7731.46] Like, better part of a decade at this point.
[7731.56 → 7732.00] And I only...
[7732.00 → 7736.08] People were surprised to find out that I had one in that assistant swap video.
[7736.20 → 7737.80] Because he only just started.
[7738.14 → 7739.54] He started less than six months ago.
[7739.54 → 7744.70] By the way, I'd like to address something from that video.
[7745.34 → 7749.96] The number of people that are mad at me about being so like...
[7749.96 → 7750.42] Like...
[7750.42 → 7755.14] Like disrespectful that I barely even talk to my assistant or look at him or whatever.
[7755.28 → 7756.28] And that's why I didn't notice.
[7756.80 → 7758.32] Do you know why I wasn't talking to him?
[7758.84 → 7761.08] Do you know why I wasn't paying attention to him?
[7761.38 → 7762.34] Because he's in recovery?
[7762.50 → 7766.38] Because I thought he was at work after having gone through eye surgery and mouth surgery.
[7766.38 → 7769.18] I was trying to interact with him as little as humanly possible.
[7769.44 → 7770.68] Not use them as much.
[7770.76 → 7771.10] Yes.
[7771.70 → 7773.24] So I barely talked to him.
[7773.40 → 7773.62] Nope.
[7773.68 → 7774.98] Because he shouldn't have been at work.
[7775.08 → 7775.60] Evil person.
[7776.36 → 7778.00] It's so frustrating, man.
[7778.20 → 7788.44] Like, it's honestly frustrating how determined some people are to find the absolute worst possible explanation for anything that I do.
[7788.68 → 7788.88] Yeah.
[7788.88 → 7792.54] But anything I do, it absolutely blows my mind.
[7793.24 → 7795.96] Anyway, so back to the XQC thing.
[7796.04 → 7800.86] So my new favourite deranged thing is he was talking about this on stream.
[7800.98 → 7804.48] So I'm not disclosing something that is private information or anything like that.
[7804.70 → 7806.66] But as a streamer, he moves around a lot.
[7806.86 → 7809.66] And we probably don't need to explain why that would be.
[7809.66 → 7814.54] A lot of streamers move around a lot just for security and privacy, right?
[7814.66 → 7815.98] You know, they're public figures.
[7816.18 → 7816.36] Definitely.
[7816.84 → 7820.96] And being live is different from recording vlogs, right?
[7821.26 → 7828.24] Like, I worked across multiple countries this week.
[7828.32 → 7831.00] And there was no disruption to our upload schedule.
[7831.28 → 7832.88] Live, you don't have that luxury.
[7832.96 → 7835.60] If you don't have somewhere to stream from, you're not producing.
[7835.96 → 7836.30] That's it.
[7836.52 → 7837.02] It's that simple.
[7837.02 → 7840.40] So anyway, he moves around a fair bit.
[7840.74 → 7842.46] And I didn't know that.
[7842.58 → 7845.16] I have to confess, I hadn't watched a ton of his streams.
[7845.34 → 7846.02] Like, I don't...
[7846.02 → 7847.84] I'm not going to hide from it.
[7847.90 → 7849.52] I might read the comments once in a while.
[7849.64 → 7850.74] But I don't...
[7850.74 → 7852.42] Like, I'm paying attention to his career.
[7852.86 → 7854.32] But I'm not watching the streams.
[7854.66 → 7856.62] And so I wasn't aware of this.
[7856.68 → 7862.92] But when I walked in, I was kind of, like, taken aback by how bare things were.
[7862.92 → 7864.02] Like, it felt like...
[7864.02 → 7865.98] You know that scene in How the Drink Stole Christmas?
[7865.98 → 7869.90] After the Drink takes everything but the wire hanging on the wall.
[7870.08 → 7870.16] Oh, yeah.
[7870.16 → 7870.24] Yeah.
[7870.38 → 7870.60] You know?
[7870.70 → 7872.94] And the crumb on the floor for the mouse, right?
[7873.04 → 7874.36] And he steals the crumb at the very end.
[7874.44 → 7875.82] Like, it was, like, weird.
[7876.04 → 7880.74] It was, like, there are a lot of boxes, but not a lot of furniture, you know?
[7880.74 → 7887.56] And so he was explaining that it came up because I needed some electrical tape.
[7887.66 → 7888.78] And I was like, oh, what are the odds?
[7889.12 → 7890.08] Do you have any electrical tape?
[7890.12 → 7893.40] Because I wanted to cover up some loose contacts that I was worried were going to short.
[7893.86 → 7896.14] And it takes them about five seconds.
[7896.50 → 7898.42] There's this toolbox that's right there in the room.
[7898.84 → 7899.66] Grab some electrical tape.
[7900.06 → 7900.78] New in-box.
[7900.98 → 7901.70] New in-packaging.
[7901.86 → 7902.30] Throws it to me.
[7902.30 → 7907.88] I'm like, oh, well, this is, that's impressive because even with my perfectly organized garage
[7907.88 → 7911.86] that I love talking about, it probably would have taken me more like 10 seconds, even though
[7911.86 → 7913.44] my garage is perfectly organized.
[7915.26 → 7917.72] Anywho, I kind of, I was, like, really impressed.
[7917.80 → 7919.38] And he goes, oh, well, don't be that impressed.
[7919.50 → 7921.86] That's a brand-new toolbox full of brand-new tools.
[7921.98 → 7923.40] I've, like, never touched it, basically.
[7923.86 → 7924.78] And I'm like, sorry, what?
[7925.78 → 7927.20] Okay, why do you have it?
[7927.20 → 7934.54] And he explains that he has an Amazon wish list that has all the essentials for living.
[7935.60 → 7942.42] And what he does is every time he moves, he rebuys everything sent straight to the new address.
[7942.88 → 7945.96] So it's all just there in boxes when he arrives.
[7946.36 → 7947.74] He unpacks it.
[7948.12 → 7953.72] He said he brings with him his CPU and, like, monitor, like, maybe, I don't even know if he
[7953.72 → 7955.04] mentioned his keyboard, honestly.
[7956.22 → 7959.84] And by CPU, I think he might have meant tower because I doubt he's going to, like, pull the
[7959.84 → 7960.78] CPU out of the socket.
[7960.98 → 7961.18] Yeah.
[7962.28 → 7969.56] But it sounds like, other than what fits in the back of a car, he takes absolutely nothing
[7969.56 → 7971.98] with him and just rebuys everything.
[7972.08 → 7973.30] I'm like, wow.
[7974.46 → 7975.12] All right.
[7978.26 → 7979.30] I mean, it's a hassle.
[7979.60 → 7982.22] I mean, yeah, packing is a pain.
[7982.22 → 7984.56] And one of the things is, like, I've heard this from a lot of people.
[7984.72 → 7984.90] Yeah.
[7985.64 → 7986.14] Oh, yeah.
[7986.18 → 7987.18] And him in particular.
[7987.60 → 7991.18] As far as my understanding goes, I don't watch either, but again, I follow careers.
[7991.78 → 7994.54] He has more streamed hours than, like, anyone.
[7994.98 → 7996.88] He's just always online.
[7996.88 → 7997.76] I'll tell you this.
[7998.16 → 8001.76] Just being there with him that one time, guy's a tank.
[8001.94 → 8002.10] Yeah.
[8002.30 → 8003.90] An absolute unit.
[8004.18 → 8010.10] Like, I don't think it was out of rudeness at all, but I don't think the thought entered
[8010.10 → 8013.32] his mind at all of, like, food.
[8013.80 → 8014.04] Yeah.
[8014.38 → 8015.00] Like, for real.
[8015.18 → 8018.52] He had been live for almost five hours when we arrived.
[8018.86 → 8021.34] We were there for, I think, like, three and a half or four.
[8021.34 → 8027.36] And by the time I was back at my hotel having dropped off Andy and, you know, said hi to
[8027.36 → 8030.62] the family and stuff, he was still online.
[8031.20 → 8036.16] And I'm sitting here going, like, it's a good thing that we stopped for some Mickey D's on
[8036.16 → 8038.28] the way there because otherwise we wouldn't have eaten.
[8038.48 → 8042.88] And not, again, like, not because I think he was being rude or anything like that.
[8042.88 → 8043.06] He's just dialled in.
[8043.32 → 8044.34] He's just streaming.
[8044.34 → 8048.78] As far as my understanding goes, he does marathon level streams, like, literally on the
[8048.78 → 8049.10] daily.
[8049.10 → 8049.14] Literally.
[8050.06 → 8050.46] Literally.
[8050.68 → 8052.90] So, like, he doesn't have time to do that stuff, right?
[8053.00 → 8053.92] It would be really expensive.
[8054.16 → 8057.48] It would be more expensive than, apparently, just buying it.
[8057.88 → 8058.04] Yeah.
[8058.16 → 8062.86] Well, and there's, I mean, I've been trying to, like, think about this, right?
[8062.90 → 8065.76] Because, you know, on the surface, it makes no sense, right?
[8065.78 → 8066.52] It looks calm and ready.
[8067.12 → 8075.28] But I think it's, okay, I think it's probably fair to say that major streamers, like an XQC,
[8075.28 → 8079.02] have a more mainstream appeal than someone like me.
[8079.02 → 8084.92] Like, I think it's fair to say that XQC is more famous than me, generally speaking.
[8085.06 → 8085.52] Multitude.
[8085.60 → 8089.22] Like, yeah, like, I don't, I don't really have a ton of appeal outside of tech.
[8089.22 → 8091.76] Especially as a variety gamer, which I believe he is.
[8091.80 → 8092.10] Yes.
[8092.10 → 8097.36] So, if I were to walk into a Best Buy, yeah, obviously, people are going to be like, supplies.
[8098.06 → 8099.50] You know, I go into a micro centre.
[8099.64 → 8101.54] I get absolutely mobbed, right?
[8101.70 → 8108.00] But if I go into a garden supplies store, nobody knows who I am, right?
[8108.10 → 8110.28] Whereas gaming is mainstream, right?
[8110.34 → 8117.02] And especially, like you said, if he plays all kinds of different games, then he could appeal to kind of anyone on a certain level, right?
[8117.02 → 8125.44] And so, from a security standpoint, if he hires a moving company, that means that everyone involved in that transaction knows where he came from and where he's going.
[8126.08 → 8128.02] Whereas if he just orders from Amazon...
[8131.62 → 8133.44] Didn't think about that.
[8133.70 → 8134.52] Totally makes sense.
[8134.76 → 8134.96] Yeah.
[8135.70 → 8135.96] Yep.
[8136.10 → 8137.92] And people do all kinds of weird stuff, like...
[8137.92 → 8145.02] There's got to be, like, executive, like, white glove moving companies where they move, like, you know...
[8145.02 → 8145.80] Maybe.
[8146.02 → 8146.62] Special people.
[8146.62 → 8147.54] But are they everywhere?
[8147.88 → 8149.34] Can you actually trust them?
[8149.36 → 8150.34] And it probably costs so much anyway.
[8150.34 → 8153.46] And it's so much to coordinate that you might as well just buy everything new.
[8153.58 → 8154.46] Because people are weird.
[8154.58 → 8155.50] Like, I've met, like...
[8155.50 → 8156.18] I don't know.
[8156.22 → 8157.04] I don't want to name any names.
[8157.14 → 8161.50] But, like, I've met parents of, like, my kids' friends, right?
[8161.66 → 8164.38] Who don't immediately disclose that they know who I am.
[8165.06 → 8165.56] Yeah, I hate that.
[8165.56 → 8167.84] They'll, like, interact with me for a bit first.
[8167.84 → 8168.72] I hate that so much.
[8168.80 → 8170.80] They're like, by the way, big fan.
[8171.08 → 8171.98] I'm kind of like...
[8171.98 → 8172.80] Someone very recently...
[8172.80 → 8173.98] You need to lead with that.
[8174.22 → 8174.40] Yeah.
[8174.40 → 8177.90] Someone very recently asked me about my biggest pet peeve about fan interactions.
[8178.08 → 8179.96] And I immediately jumped on that.
[8180.32 → 8180.90] Hate it.
[8181.40 → 8181.94] Hate it.
[8182.00 → 8183.12] Like, you don't...
[8183.12 → 8188.54] Another thing I hate is, like, if you and I are out to eat and there's someone seated near us.
[8189.26 → 8192.14] And then, like, we're there for, like, an hour.
[8192.78 → 8194.08] And then they get up to go leave.
[8194.08 → 8196.14] And as they're leaving, they're like, by the way, big fan.
[8196.18 → 8196.66] And they take off.
[8196.88 → 8198.64] Then my brain just has to go through, like...
[8198.64 → 8199.62] What have we been talking about?
[8199.68 → 8201.52] What did we say for the last hour?
[8201.82 → 8201.94] Yeah.
[8201.94 → 8202.82] Like, just...
[8202.82 → 8204.18] That one I get more.
[8204.42 → 8205.48] That one makes a little bit more sense.
[8206.18 → 8206.20] Because, like...
[8206.20 → 8207.92] You know, it might be socially awkward to say it.
[8207.92 → 8209.08] Like, I'm already talking.
[8209.66 → 8210.86] And, like, I know...
[8210.86 → 8211.34] I know...
[8211.34 → 8214.16] You can just tell by the body language sometimes.
[8214.46 → 8221.92] I know for some people it would have been very stressful for them to acknowledge me and then sit there, like...
[8222.84 → 8223.08] Eating.
[8223.26 → 8223.44] Yeah.
[8223.44 → 8226.14] The dining one, honestly, I get it more as well.
[8226.22 → 8226.74] It's just...
[8226.74 → 8227.84] It's still...
[8227.84 → 8230.32] As much as I understand it, it still racks my brain.
[8231.02 → 8231.58] Yvonne's...
[8231.58 → 8234.64] Like, I'm really careless about it, to be perfectly honest with you.
[8234.86 → 8238.00] Like, we should just assume people are watching at all times.
[8238.22 → 8241.40] I was in line for some attraction with Yvonne.
[8241.46 → 8242.06] And I was, like...
[8242.06 → 8247.78] I was talking about revenue numbers for, like, the last year and the next year and projections with, like, Screwdriver.
[8247.94 → 8248.86] This was before the launch.
[8249.42 → 8253.24] And Yvonne's like, okay, you're not speaking vaguely enough.
[8253.24 → 8255.26] Like, I'll keep it kind of, like...
[8255.26 → 8256.16] Kind of could be anything.
[8256.36 → 8256.70] Yeah, yeah.
[8256.72 → 8259.50] But she's like, if someone knows who you are, they're going to put two and two together.
[8259.58 → 8260.14] They're not stupid.
[8260.66 → 8268.86] And, like, later on, they must not have heard her say that, at least, because the person in front of us in line turned around and was, like, big fan, by the way.
[8269.28 → 8269.80] I'm like, oh.
[8270.76 → 8271.08] Okay.
[8271.44 → 8273.76] I hope that was nebulous enough.
[8273.86 → 8274.20] Yeah.
[8274.52 → 8275.98] Because it was pretty...
[8275.98 → 8279.84] It was pretty detailed, like, financial information about the company.
[8282.12 → 8283.00] Oh, no.
[8283.80 → 8284.14] Yeah.
[8285.32 → 8285.76] Yeah.
[8286.52 → 8286.92] Yeah.
[8287.24 → 8288.46] Linus isn't into OPSEC?
[8288.58 → 8288.84] No.
[8293.40 → 8293.96] Anyway.
[8295.88 → 8298.64] Anyway, it was definitely a different experience.
[8298.64 → 8301.32] Even though, obviously, I stream.
[8301.76 → 8305.06] Like, we're streaming for, you know, how many people are watching right now?
[8305.08 → 8305.52] It's not the same.
[8305.52 → 8305.78] Yeah.
[8306.14 → 8308.44] Look, we're streaming for over 20,000 people right now.
[8308.70 → 8311.22] Like, probably close to 25 by the time you factor in float plane.
[8311.36 → 8312.16] It's not...
[8312.16 → 8314.34] It's not 80,000.
[8314.34 → 8318.68] We, like, hang out in his area.
[8318.90 → 8320.16] But it's his area.
[8320.48 → 8320.76] Yes.
[8320.80 → 8322.28] It's their area, I should say.
[8322.34 → 8322.66] Yes.
[8322.76 → 8324.98] Because there's lots of other major streamers and stuff.
[8324.98 → 8328.86] And aside from just the volume, honestly, maybe this is weird.
[8328.86 → 8340.78] Like, maybe I shouldn't have a par asocial relationship or whatever the opposite, whatever the counter of a par asocial relationship is with an influencer or whatever.
[8340.78 → 8345.06] But, like, when I'm on WAN Show, I'm in my space.
[8345.32 → 8345.44] Yeah.
[8345.72 → 8351.66] I'm with, you know, my peeps, right?
[8352.12 → 8354.96] I'm hanging with you guys who...
[8354.96 → 8355.22] Whoops.
[8355.88 → 8356.70] What did I press?
[8356.90 → 8357.52] Okay, there we go.
[8358.00 → 8365.24] You know, and I consider you guys just, like, part of the in crowd here.
[8365.36 → 8366.32] You know, we're hanging.
[8366.32 → 8370.16] Like, WAN Show is its own entity that I...
[8370.16 → 8370.70] I don't know.
[8370.74 → 8373.34] I just almost have, like, a completely different brain space for it.
[8373.62 → 8376.36] I am often too candid on WAN Show.
[8376.46 → 8377.92] I'm often too transparent.
[8378.84 → 8382.68] Because the way that I see it is, like, well, you guys will understand.
[8383.02 → 8386.52] And if you don't, then I probably need to explain it better.
[8387.00 → 8387.16] Absolutely.
[8387.50 → 8388.44] You know what I mean?
[8388.64 → 8395.72] Like, I'm among friends, I guess, is the way that I kind of feel about WAN Show.
[8396.32 → 8400.46] But on XQC's stream, it's not like they didn't know who I was, a lot of them.
[8400.56 → 8401.80] It's not like they weren't down.
[8402.22 → 8405.82] You know, one of his top spammed emotes is my face.
[8405.86 → 8406.22] Your face.
[8406.28 → 8407.26] Like, for real, though.
[8407.42 → 8407.54] Yeah.
[8408.90 → 8413.88] Apparently, XQC has been online for 20 minutes so far and already has 31,000 viewers.
[8414.02 → 8414.58] Yeah, there you go.
[8414.58 → 8415.02] Pew.
[8417.42 → 8420.76] But they're not, like, my peeps.
[8421.42 → 8428.38] And so the pressure that I felt was not just about the sheer number of people watching and the expectations that come with that,
[8428.70 → 8440.88] but about that for a lot of people, this was their first and maybe only ever actual interaction with me doing anything other than making a silly face into my selfie camera once or twice.
[8440.88 → 8446.48] And so I was deeply worried that I wasn't going to solve the problem.
[8447.38 → 8448.66] Like, I went way overkill.
[8449.06 → 8454.52] I brought one of basically everything to completely build a new system if it came to that, like if I couldn't figure it out.
[8454.88 → 8455.12] I mean.
[8455.12 → 8463.00] But I felt like not figuring it out and just building a new computer was such a cop-out.
[8463.52 → 8465.14] That was not the outcome I wanted.
[8465.26 → 8466.48] I wanted to solve it.
[8466.74 → 8466.84] Yeah.
[8466.94 → 8470.04] Like, I wanted to go find the problem.
[8470.32 → 8474.98] Speaking of which, Dan, you had a chance to actually have a look at the motherboard.
[8475.52 → 8480.10] Was my diagnosis correct or was I barking up the wrong tree?
[8480.56 → 8481.50] They'll hear it here first.
[8483.12 → 8484.40] Does he even have a microphone?
[8484.40 → 8484.90] It's muted.
[8485.06 → 8485.46] There we go.
[8486.00 → 8489.02] No, you'll hear about it on Monday because I haven't looked at it yet.
[8489.16 → 8489.40] Oh.
[8489.54 → 8491.08] Because I've been dealing with other things.
[8491.28 → 8491.62] Oh, okay.
[8491.62 → 8492.46] It was on my desk.
[8492.70 → 8494.44] It did graze my hand, as I said.
[8494.44 → 8495.08] He's been a busy man.
[8495.14 → 8495.92] It was very heavy.
[8497.06 → 8497.78] That was a nice motherboard.
[8497.94 → 8500.50] But I will have an update for you next week if that works.
[8501.50 → 8501.84] All right.
[8502.12 → 8502.48] Sounds good.
[8502.48 → 8502.86] Sorry to disappoint.
[8503.08 → 8503.40] Thanks.
[8505.40 → 8505.80] Okay.
[8506.52 → 8507.32] BNT Masher.
[8507.32 → 8512.44] No, we do not have a solution for that yet, but we will definitely make sure you get taken care of.
[8514.40 → 8514.88] Yeah.
[8515.00 → 8517.06] So I was stressed.
[8517.76 → 8520.36] Like more stressed than I've been on any live stream.
[8520.46 → 8521.46] Like even when things go wrong.
[8521.74 → 8524.52] So things weren't even going wrong, and I was still super stressed.
[8524.70 → 8527.38] I had no way of getting more replacement parts if I needed them.
[8527.60 → 8528.40] Micro Centre was closed.
[8528.40 → 8539.62] And not to mention with LA traffic, you know, no matter how close Micro Centre is, it takes a long time to get there.
[8540.62 → 8542.06] You know how things are down there.
[8542.78 → 8545.18] So I was, man, I was shaking in my boots.
[8546.12 → 8547.88] Be perfectly, perfectly up front with you.
[8548.98 → 8550.88] Why don't you give us a couple more merch messages, Dan?
[8551.12 → 8552.64] Let's get some good Q&A going here.
[8552.92 → 8553.26] All right.
[8553.28 → 8553.86] That sounds great.
[8553.86 → 8555.50] I've got one here from William.
[8555.66 → 8556.02] Hey.
[8556.44 → 8556.82] Hold on.
[8556.90 → 8557.26] Oh, no.
[8557.48 → 8560.82] Ubisoft partners with police to monitor online harassment.
[8561.22 → 8561.62] Oh, God.
[8562.44 → 8562.80] What?
[8566.76 → 8577.14] First, how it works is first that officers specialize in responding to online abuse will train Ubisoft's moderation team in their centre in Newcastle for spotting, assessing, and currently...
[8577.14 → 8577.92] Okay.
[8578.02 → 8578.90] Well, that's something.
[8579.04 → 8579.22] Okay.
[8579.34 → 8580.50] Let's do merch messages.
[8581.14 → 8581.44] Okay.
[8581.44 → 8583.68] Okay.
[8584.30 → 8585.48] This one's from William.
[8585.72 → 8586.56] Hey, Linus.
[8586.62 → 8589.00] It said that tech monopolies are bad.
[8589.44 → 8598.60] Do you think an argument can be made that TSMC's monopoly in the chip industry is good, as it creates a silicon shield around one of the biggest tech centres in the world?
[8598.60 → 8603.04] Well, that silicon shield is going to be eroding over the next three to five years.
[8603.04 → 8629.10] I mean, Intel and the U.S. and I have made it very clear that they intend to bring cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing onto U.S. soil in order to, as far as I can tell, and we're getting into geopolitics that are obviously more complicated than any of this, but to essentially, as far as I can tell, put themselves in a position where they don't have to defend Taiwan anymore.
[8629.10 → 8640.08] And so that if China ultimately decided, oink, they could basically go, maybe we'll do something, but we don't have to do something.
[8640.08 → 8642.30] They're not quite a monopoly.
[8642.48 → 8647.36] I mean, Samsung still does have fairly leading-edge fab capabilities.
[8648.14 → 8656.02] Intel obviously has fairly leading-edge fab capabilities and seems to be determined to play some catch-up here over the next little while.
[8656.02 → 8666.68] But I would say that for the citizens of Taiwan, absolutely, the TSMC shield around their island nation has been beneficial.
[8667.26 → 8673.52] For everyone else, though, for the general consumer, no, I don't think it's beneficial to have a monopoly in any space.
[8673.88 → 8683.02] It's for the same reason that I would never argue that Linus Media Group Incorporated having a monopoly in tech benchmarking would be a good thing because—
[8683.02 → 8685.88] You've always said that you should pull from multiple sources.
[8686.02 → 8688.16] Absolutely. It's the best thing for consumers.
[8690.26 → 8691.94] Okay, I've got another one here from Kevin.
[8692.56 → 8696.50] Your quality products and great customer service are why I keep buying products.
[8696.88 → 8701.06] Question. What's the most dangerous thing you've ever done, life and limb?
[8702.00 → 8702.32] Oh.
[8704.52 → 8707.06] I don't know. I've done some pretty stupid stuff.
[8707.20 → 8709.18] Like, why don't we limit it to just for work?
[8709.18 → 8712.96] Like, I would say—
[8712.96 → 8713.32] That's so long.
[8713.96 → 8716.08] The most dangerous. Oh, my goodness.
[8717.56 → 8722.12] That time I did a flip off the fence with basically no training whatsoever.
[8722.30 → 8723.22] Oh, yeah. That was pretty bad.
[8723.22 → 8724.22] That was really stupid.
[8724.42 → 8728.28] Like, I could have easily broken a leg, broken my neck.
[8728.58 → 8730.64] Why did we jump off fences so much?
[8731.06 → 8735.46] There was an era there where, like, every couple weeks we were jumping off of tall fences.
[8735.64 → 8737.42] Yeah, I don't know.
[8737.42 → 8741.98] I don't know. I never thought about that before, but that was totally a thing.
[8742.12 → 8748.76] Some of the stuff I pulled painting houses not properly harnessed just to, like, get that one thing, like, I would not do as an adult.
[8748.76 → 8752.30] And I would absolutely, like, flip if I saw my kids doing.
[8753.00 → 8755.82] I could have died many, many times on houses.
[8755.82 → 8760.88] Yeah, yeah, I'd say those are the most dangerous things I've ever done.
[8760.96 → 8765.90] I'll kind of do anything to get the job done when it comes to just, like, risking it for the biscuit, man.
[8766.02 → 8766.26] Yeah.
[8766.72 → 8771.04] I mean, we're both sort of flawed that way.
[8771.10 → 8771.40] Yeah.
[8771.40 → 8785.40] There's been an actually considerably large amount of times when I've been like, wow, if I was, you know, like, a certain amount of inches to the left, I wouldn't be here anymore.
[8785.64 → 8787.68] There's been way too many of those.
[8787.68 → 8792.72] And I wish I cared enough about them to remember them all, but I honestly just don't.
[8794.28 → 8799.54] I don't know, man.
[8800.64 → 8801.04] Yeah.
[8801.72 → 8802.86] Okay, let's move on.
[8802.94 → 8803.60] It is what it is.
[8803.84 → 8805.20] This is not a recommendation.
[8806.34 → 8806.70] Okay.
[8806.90 → 8808.04] Do as we say, not as we do.
[8808.14 → 8808.42] Yeah.
[8808.82 → 8809.54] This one's from Scott.
[8809.54 → 8817.88] Linus, Luke, some people hold on to their old game consoles for nostalgia, while others will sell their systems to help pay for a newer one.
[8818.58 → 8820.10] Which one are you?
[8820.18 → 8820.28] Sell.
[8820.72 → 8821.02] Sell?
[8821.38 → 8824.28] Have you ever sold a piece of technology that you later regret?
[8824.80 → 8826.40] No, because you can always replace it.
[8826.70 → 8827.90] Okay, that's a lie.
[8828.52 → 8833.36] I wish I still had my View Sonic P95F Plus B, my old CRT monitor.
[8833.46 → 8834.14] That thing was sick.
[8834.68 → 8835.56] I mean, okay.
[8835.74 → 8838.84] No, no, that's a bad answer because things are definitely better now.
[8838.84 → 8841.72] There were times when I regretted it being gone, but not really.
[8841.80 → 8842.42] It was heavy.
[8843.44 → 8846.58] I regret selling my Kitsch ProMedia Ultra 5.1 speakers.
[8847.16 → 8847.30] There.
[8847.50 → 8848.40] I regret selling those.
[8849.58 → 8858.02] Nothing has really moved into their space for high-end PC surround desktop speakers.
[8858.52 → 8860.12] Those things were flippin' amazing.
[8860.24 → 8861.80] Same with my Monsoon MM2000s.
[8861.80 → 8868.58] I would have kept those and not even bothered with the Kirsches if I had realized that they were going to be so impossible to replace.
[8869.84 → 8872.66] Is there anything that you've regretted getting rid of?
[8872.76 → 8874.86] Because a game console is so commodity.
[8874.86 → 8879.22] No, I should have gotten rid of more things, and I need to continue getting rid of more things.
[8880.46 → 8882.48] There's been times when I've regretted it.
[8882.60 → 8888.12] There's been times when I got rid of something too soon, but it isn't that I shouldn't have gotten rid of it eventually.
[8888.22 → 8889.18] I just got rid of it too soon.
[8889.18 → 8898.14] There's been times when I traded in games to try to get a new game or traded in a console with games to get the new console and fewer games or whatever.
[8898.74 → 8904.10] And there are times when my dad kind of like roasted me because he's like, yeah, you shouldn't have done that.
[8904.18 → 8908.50] Not because I shouldn't have done it at all, but because, again, I did it too early.
[8908.62 → 8910.98] The Logitech Z680s where trash, by the way.
[8910.98 → 8914.82] I went from the Monsoons to the Logitech Z680s.
[8914.86 → 8924.66] I was so disappointed by the sound quality of the Logitech Z680s that I went, and I turned around, and I spent like twice as much of money I did not have to get the Promote Ultra 5.1s.
[8924.92 → 8928.62] Actually, I think I might have gone with Fireworks S700s first.
[8928.62 → 8932.66] And then I forget why I wasn't happy with those.
[8932.76 → 8934.62] And then I ultimately settled on the Kitsch Promotes.
[8936.32 → 8938.50] All right.
[8938.68 → 8939.04] Hit me.
[8939.72 → 8940.10] Okay.
[8940.14 → 8940.86] This one's from Robert.
[8941.34 → 8941.80] Hi, Robert.
[8941.98 → 8943.00] Hi, Linus and Luke.
[8943.12 → 8944.84] Finally catching you live from the UK.
[8945.10 → 8945.46] Oh, wait.
[8945.52 → 8946.46] I'm going to interrupt for a second.
[8946.60 → 8950.80] I kind of regret selling my first gen Switch because it's like the movable one.
[8951.48 → 8953.58] And I mean, with that said, you can like you can buy them.
[8953.92 → 8954.52] Like, I don't know.
[8955.00 → 8957.34] That's the thing is like as a working adult.
[8958.96 → 8960.44] And storage is really expensive.
[8960.68 → 8960.78] Yeah.
[8961.52 → 8962.36] It's often.
[8962.64 → 8964.34] And like I don't even just mean personally.
[8964.54 → 8965.46] Like even for work.
[8965.60 → 8971.70] A lot of the time, even if it's something I think we could probably use again later, I would rather just sell it now.
[8971.82 → 8973.82] Let it depreciate in someone else's hands.
[8973.94 → 8977.08] And then if we need one again, we have a whole like procurement department now.
[8977.16 → 8977.28] Okay.
[8977.32 → 8978.52] Get another one.
[8978.92 → 8979.38] eBay it.
[8979.38 → 8985.50] And then that way on the off, in the more likely scenario that we don't ultimately need one again.
[8985.78 → 8987.80] Hey, well, we have the money now.
[8988.60 → 8990.70] My thing is like I live in a small apartment.
[8991.38 → 8992.66] I can't keep all this stuff.
[8993.36 → 8994.30] I actually can't.
[8994.36 → 8994.92] There isn't enough room.
[8995.30 → 8995.42] Yeah.
[8995.44 → 8996.02] It's not practical.
[8996.36 → 8996.48] Yeah.
[8996.76 → 8997.00] Okay.
[8997.10 → 8997.34] Sorry.
[8997.44 → 8998.26] Someone's from the UK.
[8998.38 → 8999.08] Robert something.
[9000.74 → 9004.88] Well, Robert loves seeing you so excited over the ChatGPT Bing search.
[9004.88 → 9010.64] My question is when you when were you last excited about a breakthrough in tech?
[9011.20 → 9013.36] Oh, well, VR was really exciting for me.
[9014.66 → 9016.26] Original ChatGPT.
[9017.06 → 9018.02] Three weeks ago.
[9018.02 → 9018.18] Yeah.
[9018.66 → 9018.86] Yeah.
[9019.68 → 9021.60] I can almost remember it.
[9021.70 → 9022.72] Like it was.
[9023.72 → 9024.06] Yeah.
[9024.24 → 9025.62] Check out LMG clips.
[9027.92 → 9028.52] Yeah.
[9028.66 → 9029.98] I think it's the same though.
[9030.08 → 9033.14] Either the original ChatGPT launch or.
[9033.14 → 9036.52] Or I was pretty jacked on stereo 3D at the time.
[9037.16 → 9040.06] I was I was jacked for where it was headed.
[9040.52 → 9042.36] It was always too headache inducing.
[9042.52 → 9042.78] Yeah.
[9042.90 → 9043.98] With the shutter glasses.
[9044.12 → 9045.50] I couldn't play with shutter glasses.
[9045.68 → 9046.18] They hurt.
[9047.78 → 9052.32] But I was jazzed for like stereo 3D to get better and cheaper.
[9052.32 → 9054.88] And then it just didn't really happen.
[9055.70 → 9055.94] Yeah.
[9057.94 → 9058.42] Okay.
[9058.42 → 9059.42] This one's from Stuart.
[9059.42 → 9059.94] Stuart.
[9060.78 → 9065.06] Hey, Linus and Luke finally buying merch to see if you all are serious about quality.
[9065.48 → 9065.98] My question.
[9066.42 → 9070.24] What's the most obscure thing you keep on hand at all times?
[9070.36 → 9075.44] I still carry a 30 pin connector in my backpack, and it actually came in handy last week.
[9076.02 → 9078.98] I had a 30 pin in my backpack up until less than six months ago.
[9078.98 → 9082.24] Even though I haven't owned a product.
[9082.34 → 9084.90] I only ever owned one product that used that connector.
[9085.10 → 9086.12] An iPhone 4.
[9086.70 → 9088.10] I never had an iPod.
[9088.66 → 9089.46] I never.
[9089.84 → 9091.50] Yeah, I just that was the.
[9091.62 → 9091.84] Yeah.
[9093.04 → 9093.48] Okay.
[9093.60 → 9097.44] We both still use the same headphone case to organize things.
[9098.90 → 9099.52] Mine's broken.
[9100.06 → 9102.24] It just broke, and I lost my IE80s.
[9102.30 → 9103.22] I don't know what happened.
[9103.22 → 9110.32] I opened up my case, which I still have and sort of works on set recently and they just
[9110.32 → 9110.92] weren't in there.
[9111.08 → 9114.68] I must have taken them out to like quickly something.
[9116.32 → 9116.76] Whoa.
[9116.98 → 9117.88] And I didn't put them back in.
[9117.92 → 9118.80] So I need new headphones.
[9118.98 → 9120.40] That's a crazy end of an era.
[9120.58 → 9121.36] That was a long era.
[9121.58 → 9122.40] Had this forever.
[9122.52 → 9122.76] Yeah.
[9123.22 → 9127.90] And I like splurged on the inline mic cable from Sennheiser, like first party one
[9127.90 → 9129.06] that actually had a decent mic.
[9129.06 → 9132.62] Like I hosted WAN show from that thing when I was in Hawaii.
[9132.84 → 9132.94] Yeah.
[9133.62 → 9135.22] Like from that headset.
[9135.44 → 9136.28] Maybe that's where I left it.
[9136.32 → 9136.62] I don't know.
[9136.96 → 9137.88] I'm frustrated, though.
[9138.86 → 9142.06] Are those the ones with the black and white like stripe cables?
[9143.20 → 9143.50] Maybe.
[9143.70 → 9144.28] I don't remember.
[9145.02 → 9145.38] Sorry.
[9145.60 → 9146.78] I don't think so.
[9147.20 → 9147.66] So sorry.
[9147.70 → 9149.40] You were going to say your weird headphone case.
[9150.28 → 9151.66] Well, let's just say it's obscure.
[9151.88 → 9152.68] We both have it.
[9152.80 → 9155.40] Yeah, I guess it's like weird steel series headphone case.
[9155.46 → 9157.04] We both held on to for some reason.
[9159.06 → 9160.06] Yeah.
[9161.06 → 9162.96] From their flex flux series.
[9163.16 → 9163.32] Yeah.
[9163.34 → 9167.30] I don't think either of us actually use the headphones, but they had this little like
[9167.30 → 9167.94] pouch case.
[9168.06 → 9168.38] Yeah.
[9168.68 → 9168.88] Yeah.
[9169.02 → 9169.20] Yeah.
[9169.20 → 9171.32] This weird little pouch case.
[9171.80 → 9176.46] So yeah, my headphones are not in here, but I have my USB-C to three and a half mid,
[9176.58 → 9180.52] my lightning to three and a half mid and an extra pair of ear tips for the Sennheiser
[9180.52 → 9183.72] IE80s, even though my stupid headphones are no longer in here.
[9183.72 → 9190.42] Old wired ear pods and then a few different adapter thingies, fairly similar setup.
[9191.58 → 9193.08] Other than that though, I don't know.
[9193.08 → 9193.52] Yeah.
[9194.52 → 9194.80] Yeah.
[9194.80 → 9201.22] I don't have it on me right now, but I almost always have an ATX power supply pin dep inning
[9201.22 → 9201.46] tool.
[9201.84 → 9202.04] Yeah.
[9202.12 → 9203.52] And a Mole dep inning tool.
[9204.08 → 9209.08] And man, that came in super handy in the Intel Arc challenge because I needed to Devin
[9209.08 → 9213.96] a PCIe connector, and it uses the same size pins as a 24 pin, same size pins as the four
[9213.96 → 9215.16] and the eight pin CPU connector.
[9215.38 → 9217.98] So I almost always have one of those on me as well.
[9217.98 → 9222.92] This is super not obscure, but I carry a paper clip for a similar reason, just so I can bridge
[9222.92 → 9223.44] power supplies.
[9223.68 → 9223.94] Mm.
[9224.38 → 9224.68] Mm-hmm.
[9225.92 → 9228.96] One of the like actually just metal ones, not coated with stuff.
[9229.20 → 9229.32] Yeah.
[9230.42 → 9230.64] Okay.
[9230.68 → 9231.72] Got one here from Taylor.
[9231.94 → 9237.84] If you could choose one modern item to bring back in time and give to people in the 16th century,
[9238.02 → 9239.20] what would it be and why?
[9239.26 → 9240.08] It's very specific.
[9242.30 → 9243.26] One item.
[9243.52 → 9244.36] 16th century.
[9245.22 → 9245.66] Okay.
[9247.06 → 9247.50] Wow.
[9247.50 → 9249.20] And so I just give it to them?
[9249.52 → 9250.10] That's it?
[9251.02 → 9252.84] I would assume so.
[9253.76 → 9255.18] What about something that could like...
[9255.18 → 9256.34] Oh, you give to people.
[9256.76 → 9258.96] So you could like hand them out, I would assume.
[9259.52 → 9259.92] Condoms.
[9262.94 → 9264.20] Seriously, contraceptive.
[9265.16 → 9270.72] Like, do you know how much less prevalent like STIs would probably be today if people started
[9270.72 → 9272.92] using condoms like 400, 500 years ago?
[9273.16 → 9273.90] 16th century.
[9273.90 → 9281.04] I think it would be like a not actually that advanced but still medical textbook.
[9281.74 → 9282.58] A textbook.
[9282.74 → 9283.62] That's a better answer.
[9284.32 → 9288.30] Because like you wouldn't want to bring like a phone because it's going to die.
[9288.46 → 9288.64] Yeah.
[9288.74 → 9288.90] Yeah.
[9288.94 → 9290.14] Or like a car or whatever.
[9290.30 → 9290.44] Yeah.
[9290.60 → 9291.04] Like a...
[9291.04 → 9291.18] Yeah.
[9291.18 → 9291.82] A medical textbook.
[9291.92 → 9292.24] That's good.
[9292.36 → 9292.74] Good answer.
[9292.82 → 9294.14] I changed my answer to medical textbook.
[9294.14 → 9296.58] Actually, I changed my answer to engineering textbook.
[9296.74 → 9296.82] There.
[9297.30 → 9297.56] Cool.
[9297.76 → 9297.90] Okay.
[9298.02 → 9298.30] All right.
[9298.44 → 9299.28] Carry on.
[9299.92 → 9300.52] Soap.
[9301.32 → 9302.56] Chad's answers are amazing.
[9303.62 → 9306.22] What's the crop thing that changed the world?
[9307.76 → 9308.16] DDT.
[9308.16 → 9308.22] Okay.
[9309.26 → 9310.62] I'm going to bring the roundup.
[9311.92 → 9313.06] This is...
[9313.06 → 9314.90] Oh no.
[9315.00 → 9316.26] This just kills everything.
[9317.00 → 9319.88] Roundup at like a cocktail of roundup and rat poison.
[9320.08 → 9321.28] Just hope they don't drink it.
[9321.48 → 9322.32] Roundup and condoms.
[9322.34 → 9323.72] Because man, because man, people...
[9323.72 → 9326.52] People consume some weird stuff.
[9326.62 → 9328.44] Like how did we ever discover cheese?
[9329.08 → 9329.68] Oh, there's a lot of...
[9329.68 → 9331.32] Who's just like, I'm going to eat this.
[9331.54 → 9333.44] There are a lot of things down that rabbit hole.
[9333.44 → 9334.56] Like freaking...
[9334.56 → 9336.40] Man, is it like cottage cheese?
[9336.50 → 9337.34] It's like...
[9337.34 → 9340.18] Someone's like, yeah, this has been fermenting for months.
[9340.24 → 9340.94] I'm just going to eat this.
[9340.94 → 9343.54] Basically, anything that's fermented, it's like, bro.
[9345.56 → 9347.16] What the f*** were you thinking?
[9347.40 → 9347.62] Yeah.
[9349.94 → 9354.08] What about that puffer fish that if you cook it incorrectly, you just die?
[9354.08 → 9354.46] Yeah.
[9354.66 → 9357.70] It's like, why did you keep trying?
[9359.52 → 9359.96] Jeez.
[9361.40 → 9362.32] I don't know.
[9362.32 → 9364.42] Okay, this one's from David.
[9364.78 → 9365.88] Let me just catch my breath here.
[9366.50 → 9371.32] I sadly just barely missed out on the Labs and Office Tour add-on packs for LTX.
[9371.42 → 9374.46] Is there any chance you guys will open more spots?
[9374.86 → 9376.00] We've talked about it.
[9376.40 → 9378.48] Colton and Chase want to try to open some more spots.
[9378.60 → 9384.72] But the reality of it is that there's a finite number of people that we can filter through here during that time.
[9384.72 → 9392.32] And we don't want the people who have purchased tours already to feel like they're being rushed so we could just squeeze more money out of people.
[9392.44 → 9394.74] That's not the goal of LTX.
[9394.74 → 9399.70] We didn't have enough VIP or whale packages for the demand.
[9399.70 → 9406.80] But if we triple the number of VIP spots, well, then you're not really very VIP anymore, are you?
[9407.02 → 9407.20] Right?
[9407.26 → 9409.08] Like, it's got to be a limited number of people.
[9409.16 → 9412.80] Otherwise, we can't really give them the attention that they need.
[9412.80 → 9419.10] So I don't think we're going to expand it a ton, but I do think they're going to try to offer some more.
[9419.24 → 9421.86] As for how they will dole those out, I have no idea.
[9421.94 → 9426.24] By the way, something you might want to look into is there's actually a bunch of people posting in Flip plane Chat right now,
[9426.64 → 9428.82] recent videos that you wore the IE80s in.
[9429.08 → 9431.12] I wore them while reacting to the worst LTD videos.
[9431.18 → 9432.70] That's almost certainly when I lost it then.
[9433.24 → 9434.00] They might be in the couch.
[9436.62 → 9436.98] Goodbye.
[9437.46 → 9438.36] Do you want me to check?
[9439.56 → 9440.64] Oh, he's going.
[9440.64 → 9443.26] Is there one that I can answer without Linus?
[9443.36 → 9444.10] I'm sure.
[9444.36 → 9444.78] Keep it going.
[9445.04 → 9446.66] I might have already done it, unfortunately.
[9447.06 → 9447.84] Hi, Linus.
[9450.80 → 9452.48] Oh, there might be some in Potential.
[9452.60 → 9453.14] Let's have a look.
[9453.40 → 9454.64] Yeah, I'm skipping through things as well.
[9454.88 → 9455.70] We'll find something.
[9456.60 → 9457.26] We'll find something.
[9457.60 → 9458.52] I can answer this one.
[9458.78 → 9460.44] There's one in Potential, I guess.
[9460.98 → 9462.90] Will there ever be another Scrapyard Wars?
[9463.06 → 9464.94] I'll put that as a probably not.
[9466.12 → 9468.42] There is none planned right now.
[9468.50 → 9469.76] I would say it's unlikely.
[9469.76 → 9479.60] I learned a long time ago that it's a little bit of a danger noodle to be steadfast with certain things because the internet will try to hold you to it.
[9480.10 → 9482.84] But I'll say, yeah, pretty hard, probably not.
[9483.54 → 9485.56] It kind of ran its course, guys.
[9485.88 → 9487.18] I love it as well.
[9487.70 → 9492.58] But we've kind of done everything that's going to be fascinating.
[9492.58 → 9496.66] And we would pretty much have to change hosts because Linus is way too recognizable.
[9500.32 → 9502.48] Yeah, it would just change a lot.
[9502.48 → 9504.48] I've got one here that you could probably answer.
[9504.70 → 9504.88] Okay.
[9504.88 → 9505.68] It's an add-on.
[9506.62 → 9507.92] Align your moral compass.
[9507.92 → 9510.68] My wife works for Kids Help Phone.
[9511.12 → 9516.74] Due to high demand, they do not always get convos required?
[9517.50 → 9518.06] Recorded?
[9518.30 → 9518.50] Rec?
[9519.02 → 9519.74] R-E-Q.
[9519.74 → 9524.52] Do you think using a supervised AI chatbot will fill the gap?
[9524.86 → 9526.18] Would it be right?
[9527.10 → 9528.30] And I had no idea.
[9528.80 → 9529.86] What is this thing even?
[9530.28 → 9531.20] Kids Rec Phone?
[9531.32 → 9531.66] What is that?
[9532.30 → 9534.20] It's a Kids Help Phone.
[9534.32 → 9535.10] It's Kids Help Phone.
[9535.14 → 9535.60] It's Help Phone.
[9535.70 → 9536.24] What is that, though?
[9536.24 → 9539.00] I think that's like your child.
[9539.16 → 9542.10] You call the help phone, and you get help or advice.
[9542.10 → 9543.88] Is it like, hello, I am in danger?
[9544.26 → 9544.86] I think so.
[9544.92 → 9547.58] Or is it like, hello, how do I make a peanut butter and jam sandwich?
[9549.84 → 9551.28] Confidential, anonymous, and free.
[9551.28 → 9558.64] It's like online and telephone counselling and volunteer-led text-based support in English.
[9558.70 → 9561.16] Yeah, I don't think these technologies are ready for that yet.
[9561.50 → 9564.10] The potential for harm there is extreme.
[9566.24 → 9572.66] So, let's not.
[9573.02 → 9576.88] Let's take the money that we make with them and fund Kids Help Phone.
[9577.70 → 9580.00] Yeah, it seems like a good thing to fund.
[9580.56 → 9585.32] The reason why I'm kind of dragging here is because it seems not good to not answer them.
[9585.80 → 9588.90] But I wouldn't want to drive them down a wrong path with an AI that's answering poorly.
[9588.90 → 9589.82] This looks promising, Lies.
[9590.32 → 9595.60] Maybe like a smart FAQ where it could only spit out answers that were pre-written.
[9596.24 → 9597.18] Something like that.
[9597.90 → 9600.48] No dice, but I do think we're on the right track.
[9600.58 → 9605.80] Because I remember plugging into a splitter so that we could all use the same output.
[9606.28 → 9611.58] And probably it's still plugged into that sitting in the writer's bin for that project or something.
[9611.58 → 9612.30] Was this when I was there?
[9612.90 → 9613.72] Was that that video?
[9613.86 → 9614.62] No, different video.
[9614.76 → 9615.00] Okay.
[9615.00 → 9615.40] Okay.
[9616.94 → 9617.30] Okay.
[9617.34 → 9618.66] Here's another one from Adam.
[9619.00 → 9620.50] Hey, Luke and Linus.
[9620.58 → 9621.14] Happy Friday.
[9621.62 → 9624.76] What's your favourite feature of any car you've owned?
[9625.22 → 9625.66] P.S.
[9625.96 → 9631.00] Any ETA on the Linus new car wrap reveal video?
[9631.80 → 9632.80] We shot it today.
[9633.14 → 9633.90] Oh, no.
[9634.30 → 9634.90] New wrap?
[9635.12 → 9635.96] It's bad.
[9636.14 → 9636.86] There's a new wrap?
[9637.06 → 9637.78] I saw it today.
[9637.78 → 9640.40] Did you write it?
[9640.64 → 9641.42] How bad is it?
[9641.58 → 9641.84] Oh, no.
[9641.92 → 9642.80] Not that kind of wrap.
[9642.90 → 9643.62] Like a vinyl wrap.
[9643.80 → 9644.04] Oh.
[9644.70 → 9645.76] Look how disappointed he is.
[9646.90 → 9647.54] I assure you.
[9647.84 → 9649.26] That's genuinely so much less interesting.
[9649.42 → 9651.86] I assure you it's funnier than any wrap that I would write.
[9652.88 → 9653.60] Are you sure?
[9653.72 → 9653.74] Boo!
[9654.12 → 9656.20] Do you think I would find it funnier?
[9656.32 → 9657.00] It's pretty bad.
[9657.40 → 9657.68] Okay.
[9658.52 → 9659.62] It is ridiculous.
[9659.86 → 9660.08] Okay.
[9660.14 → 9660.88] I'm a little excited then.
[9661.06 → 9661.24] Yeah.
[9661.24 → 9664.42] I would have been more excited if you wrote a wrap.
[9664.60 → 9670.52] I wouldn't look at a place in this tracksuit with chains getting out of that car.
[9670.78 → 9671.36] That's fun.
[9671.66 → 9671.92] Uh-huh.
[9673.24 → 9675.18] Is it like digital camo or something?
[9675.22 → 9675.98] You'll have to see it.
[9675.98 → 9676.88] I'll show you after.
[9677.16 → 9677.30] Yeah.
[9678.76 → 9679.46] It's cringe.
[9682.00 → 9682.44] Yeah.
[9682.74 → 9683.14] Anywho.
[9685.08 → 9686.30] What were we talking about again?
[9686.32 → 9687.76] What's your favourite car feature?
[9687.76 → 9689.86] Oh, my favourite car feature.
[9689.86 → 9691.52] Of any car that you have owned.
[9691.60 → 9692.88] Probably the Go Pedal.
[9693.54 → 9695.10] The Go Pedal.
[9696.48 → 9698.60] Why do you get to be like an asshole about it?
[9699.80 → 9701.16] Just answer the question.
[9702.32 → 9703.92] I've only owned two cars.
[9704.24 → 9704.58] Okay.
[9705.30 → 9708.02] My dad drove a New Yorker when I was a kid.
[9709.60 → 9711.02] And every time.
[9712.02 → 9712.72] We had one of those.
[9712.74 → 9713.50] You're a New Yorker?
[9713.60 → 9714.60] You're a New Yorker enthusiast?
[9714.60 → 9716.96] New Yorker brought him 1972, I think it was.
[9716.96 → 9717.16] Okay.
[9717.20 → 9720.96] I had no idea how obscure and weird the cars my dad drove when I was a kid were.
[9721.14 → 9723.16] He also had an MG convertible.
[9723.50 → 9723.82] Whoa.
[9723.96 → 9724.44] Whoa.
[9725.10 → 9726.18] White with the green stripe.
[9726.30 → 9729.88] And I'm sitting here going, apparently, that was a super cool car.
[9729.98 → 9730.12] Yeah.
[9730.12 → 9731.50] And I just had no idea at the time.
[9731.50 → 9734.88] Anyway, my dad drove a New Yorker.
[9735.32 → 9737.36] And one of the features on it.
[9737.40 → 9739.34] So this is in the mid-90s, right?
[9739.96 → 9746.86] One of the features on it that just, or early 90s maybe, that just tickled me so much.
[9746.94 → 9749.74] Like it was kind of way ahead of its time in a number of ways.
[9749.84 → 9751.94] It had a digital speedometer, for example.
[9752.34 → 9754.60] Instead, I mean, instead of like a needle.
[9754.60 → 9757.40] A needle, which blew my mind at the time.
[9757.96 → 9759.46] And it talked to you.
[9760.46 → 9760.68] Okay?
[9761.32 → 9766.44] So if, for example, I got in, and I didn't manage to get the door closed all the way.
[9766.52 → 9771.06] Instead of beeping or like having a little light that flashed up, it had a voice that said,
[9771.74 → 9773.26] A door is ajar.
[9773.26 → 9773.30] A door is ajar.
[9774.82 → 9779.24] And the first time I heard it, it's one of those like childhood memories, right?
[9779.38 → 9782.60] The first time I heard it, I was with one of my friends.
[9782.76 → 9782.94] Okay?
[9783.10 → 9784.24] Axel, if you're out there, sup.
[9784.68 → 9785.02] Okay?
[9785.24 → 9786.30] I was with one of my friends.
[9786.42 → 9789.78] And we both just lost it.
[9790.22 → 9790.74] Of course.
[9790.84 → 9792.04] A door is ajar.
[9792.40 → 9794.50] A door is a door, you dumb f***er.
[9796.32 → 9797.10] You have to.
[9797.10 → 9799.42] Because the first time you hear that, it sounds crazy.
[9799.58 → 9800.36] Yeah, of course.
[9800.86 → 9802.06] That totally makes sense.
[9802.06 → 9807.88] So that was, I mean, to call that my favourite feature of any car I've ever owned, I think
[9807.88 → 9809.32] would be a bit of a stretch.
[9809.34 → 9810.56] Most amusing feature, maybe.
[9810.56 → 9813.90] But it's probably the one that I enjoyed the most at the moment.
[9815.46 → 9816.96] A door is ajar.
[9817.38 → 9818.12] Oh, man.
[9818.28 → 9819.36] Oh, I f***in glove it.
[9819.62 → 9823.52] Apparently, like, comedians have done bits on this and stuff.
[9823.58 → 9824.62] Okay, I had no idea.
[9824.62 → 9827.82] I thought I was just an eight-year-old being amused by my car.
[9828.84 → 9831.56] I mean, yeah, I miss my stick shift from my Civic.
[9831.56 → 9832.20] That's for sure.
[9832.62 → 9833.24] Not surprised.
[9833.66 → 9836.18] Uh, man, I don't know.
[9836.90 → 9839.32] Like, Android Auto is pretty great.
[9840.02 → 9843.22] Like, it's a really boring feature.
[9843.32 → 9845.22] Honestly, like, car features.
[9845.22 → 9850.94] I do find it hilarious how you have trouble calling, like, Yvonne using your thing, and
[9850.94 → 9856.08] my car has no problem calling anyone because it doesn't do any internet stuff.
[9856.24 → 9856.58] Yeah.
[9856.70 → 9858.08] It's just local search.
[9858.22 → 9866.12] Whatever they had in 2009 can search my local directory faster and more accurately than Google
[9866.12 → 9868.22] Voice can, which is so funny.
[9868.22 → 9870.60] Like, if I need to call my girlfriend, it's immediate.
[9871.32 → 9872.34] There's no messing around.
[9872.66 → 9876.78] Yes, I have to, like, either import it manually from my phone or enter it manually, which I
[9876.78 → 9877.12] never do.
[9877.18 → 9878.06] I just import it from my phone.
[9878.34 → 9879.60] But it still works.
[9879.98 → 9882.60] It imports from my modern phone properly.
[9882.60 → 9883.78] So, like, I don't care.
[9884.62 → 9886.58] Through Bluetooth, everything, like, it's, I don't know.
[9886.62 → 9887.06] It's fine.
[9887.24 → 9888.72] I love the backup camera on my Volt.
[9889.56 → 9889.84] Yeah.
[9889.88 → 9894.62] It is so, so much better than the Taycan.
[9895.18 → 9898.00] It's so much better than the Odyssey.
[9898.26 → 9900.92] It's better than any other car that I have ever driven.
[9901.34 → 9903.56] It's just zero BS.
[9903.56 → 9905.38] I can always see out of it.
[9905.70 → 9905.74] Yeah.
[9905.84 → 9909.42] The lines are actually accurate for where my wheels will go.
[9909.58 → 9915.62] And it is mind-blowing to me that other cars can't do it that well.
[9915.84 → 9921.42] I mean, honestly, honestly, how hard is it for you guys to do a calibration routine with
[9921.42 → 9927.70] the car and be like, okay, wheel here, this, okay, check, I don't know, pressure sensors
[9927.70 → 9928.76] on the floor, whatever.
[9929.08 → 9931.30] Just guess and check for all I care.
[9931.30 → 9933.66] But it should be accurate.
[9934.90 → 9938.04] And honestly, the new car is, like, a mess.
[9938.40 → 9939.62] The proximity sensors go off.
[9939.70 → 9942.44] I have the proximity sensor go off, like, in traffic sometimes.
[9943.06 → 9947.02] If I, if I just, I'm not, I'm not that close.
[9947.14 → 9947.98] Chill, brush.
[9948.86 → 9955.64] There's a there's a comment in, in full plane chat from Neo Keen, Neo Keen?
[9955.82 → 9956.48] Oh, man.
[9956.62 → 9956.84] Sorry.
[9956.94 → 9957.36] I don't know.
[9957.84 → 9961.20] That said, Luke's 2009 car is more advanced than my 2012 car.
[9961.30 → 9962.80] This was actually a problem.
[9964.20 → 9965.70] I don't know if you remember this.
[9965.76 → 9966.18] Maybe you do.
[9966.42 → 9970.08] We tried to do a progression of car technology video.
[9970.74 → 9971.14] Oh.
[9971.40 → 9972.36] And we were going to use.
[9972.46 → 9973.14] I vaguely remember that.
[9973.20 → 9974.40] We were going to use my car.
[9974.40 → 9982.26] And we were working with a car manufacturer so that they could send us, like, an equivalent tier car from them.
[9982.32 → 9983.26] It was a different company, though.
[9983.30 → 9983.50] Yeah.
[9983.56 → 9987.26] And we were going to show them, like, look, it's been four years.
[9987.48 → 9989.78] This is all the progression that has been made.
[9990.04 → 9990.26] Yeah.
[9990.30 → 9991.98] Cameras are better and this and that.
[9991.98 → 9995.54] And it was worse in every measurable way.
[9996.44 → 10001.14] And then mutually we just decided, like, I guess we won't do this video.
[10001.62 → 10002.10] Yeah.
[10002.38 → 10003.30] That was amazing.
[10003.40 → 10003.98] Question mark?
[10004.06 → 10004.96] And just moved on.
[10005.08 → 10005.26] Yeah.
[10005.26 → 10005.78] That was it.
[10006.00 → 10006.42] I don't know.
[10007.00 → 10008.68] It was an equivalent to your car.
[10008.68 → 10014.20] It was as expensive as if you bought the same model of my car but new.
[10016.52 → 10018.44] I don't know.
[10018.56 → 10019.06] It was weird.
[10019.30 → 10025.30] I was pretty – as a like, computer tech guy, not a car tech guy, I was pretty surprised.
[10026.46 → 10028.48] Because you'd think things would get better.
[10028.74 → 10028.92] Yeah.
[10028.98 → 10030.66] Since then, I am not as surprised.
[10030.76 → 10031.34] Now we know.
[10031.56 → 10031.78] Yep.
[10033.66 → 10034.10] Okay.
[10034.24 → 10035.74] This one here is from Ernest.
[10035.74 → 10039.52] Hey, Linus, I know you're a water-cooling PC fan.
[10039.90 → 10041.40] If you ever –
[10041.40 → 10042.20] Yeah.
[10042.70 → 10048.74] – made a water hardline toolkit, what would you include that current kits don't include or have?
[10049.88 → 10050.28] Huh.
[10051.64 → 10054.92] What would I include?
[10055.10 → 10055.94] Man, I don't know.
[10056.24 → 10060.20] Like, fittings that don't hurt your fingers when you're trying to do them up?
[10060.36 → 10063.12] I don't think I have any brilliant ideas for that.
[10063.12 → 10066.66] I mean, honestly, I would try to avoid any bends whatsoever.
[10066.76 → 10067.06] You know what?
[10067.34 → 10067.56] Here.
[10067.78 → 10069.16] I would try to include this.
[10069.72 → 10075.12] I would love to – this is, like, so early that someone's going to –
[10075.12 → 10076.14] Ah, it's a perfect idea.
[10076.24 → 10076.48] You know what?
[10076.50 → 10077.58] Maybe I shouldn't talk about this.
[10078.82 → 10080.58] I decline to answer your question.
[10080.58 → 10092.34] I have a perfect idea for a water-cooling product, and it's the kind of thing that the smart business thing to do would probably be to design it, patent it, and release it.
[10092.56 → 10094.14] It's a pretty cool product idea.
[10094.64 → 10103.04] And the idea – the goal of it would be to make hardline water-cooling a lot easier by simplifying the process of doing all the bends and cutting all the lengths.
[10103.90 → 10107.36] I don't think it's something that someone else will do, but if they do, then great.
[10107.52 → 10112.40] I'll just tell you guys at the time, but it's a pretty solid idea, and I've already sent it over to the Creator Warehouse team.
[10112.66 → 10112.88] Cool.
[10113.38 → 10113.70] Sorry.
[10114.34 → 10114.74] Sorry.
[10115.16 → 10115.52] Sorry.
[10116.52 → 10117.98] Try to be very open with you guys.
[10118.68 → 10119.00] Okay.
[10119.10 → 10120.00] This one's from Mark.
[10120.16 → 10121.18] Maybe I'll answer this one.
[10121.18 → 10123.88] Thank you for your videos getting me into computers.
[10124.16 → 10131.50] I'm studying data science at the U.S. Air Force Academy and find military tech fascinating, especially fly-by-wire computers.
[10131.98 → 10136.86] Have you ever considered covering military tech on LTT, or if not, why not?
[10137.16 → 10137.96] It's hard.
[10138.56 → 10140.08] I mean, that's like the whole point.
[10140.20 → 10144.06] You want to check out a data centre of PlayStation's in a shipping container?
[10144.24 → 10145.04] Well, okay.
[10146.34 → 10147.30] Like, it's tough.
[10147.30 → 10151.92] It's not designed to necessarily be cutting edge in the way that we think about things being cutting edge.
[10152.10 → 10157.96] It's cutting edge, and like, this will definitely still be working if it's buried in mud for six months,
[10157.96 → 10161.86] and someone walks along and picks it up, and it's the person who's supposed to be using it.
[10161.94 → 10168.90] Like, it's a really different kind of design intent, military technology,
[10168.90 → 10174.62] and any of the stuff that really is, like, cutting edge the way we would think about it in terms of processing power,
[10174.62 → 10176.56] yeah, I would have absolutely no access to whatsoever.
[10176.56 → 10177.86] And if I did, they'd have to kill me.
[10178.30 → 10181.26] So there's just not really much for us to say.
[10181.44 → 10183.18] Or it'll end up on the Worth Under forums.
[10183.72 → 10184.26] Or that.
[10185.48 → 10188.52] Yeah, if you want to follow it, just hang out on the Worth Under forums.
[10190.52 → 10194.32] There was someone who tweeted, oh, no, I don't even want to talk about this.
[10194.76 → 10195.06] Okay.
[10195.40 → 10197.22] Okay, I'll interrupt you with another question.
[10197.30 → 10198.22] This one's from Weston.
[10198.22 → 10206.30] Hey, Linus and Luke, been loving the videos-wan lately with so many businesses moving online these days.
[10206.46 → 10211.42] Do you think brick-and-mortar tech stores are a thing of the past, or is there still a need for these establishments?
[10211.52 → 10212.24] Oh, absolutely.
[10212.40 → 10213.68] You still need brick-and-mortar, right?
[10214.10 → 10217.32] Retail foot traffic has increased double-digit percentage.
[10217.32 → 10221.48] People want to see things before they buy.
[10221.62 → 10224.66] And more importantly, I think people want that instant gratification.
[10225.46 → 10231.04] Like, I wanted an addressable RGB strip for some reason.
[10231.24 → 10234.34] And I was super frustrated that I couldn't just go and buy it.
[10234.34 → 10240.74] And, okay, something that I'm doing right now is I want to paint my helmet and my bike to match.
[10241.42 → 10248.02] And I didn't want to just, like, learn about paint online and order something online and hope that it's good.
[10248.06 → 10249.22] I wanted a personal touch.
[10249.28 → 10252.14] So I found a local, like, automotive paint supplier.
[10252.70 → 10253.18] Went in.
[10253.24 → 10256.32] They were super nice and talked to me and explained stuff.
[10256.36 → 10260.44] And they mixed up some samples for me free of charge so that I could play around with them in the gun
[10260.44 → 10262.82] and kind of see what I like and see what works and what doesn't.
[10262.82 → 10265.56] And that's just something that you're not going to get online.
[10265.66 → 10272.18] Even with perfect online customer service, you can't have that immediate back and forth.
[10272.80 → 10275.64] This is from the previous topic, and I'll jump back on what you just said in a second.
[10275.96 → 10278.08] But Gibberish in Float plane Chat said,
[10278.16 → 10280.36] I work in a defence contracting company.
[10280.72 → 10286.56] In the last year, I designed a new 1394B, a.k.a. FireWire board.
[10287.02 → 10287.34] Yeah.
[10287.64 → 10288.18] Oof.
[10288.82 → 10289.28] Yeah.
[10289.70 → 10290.48] It's not necessary.
[10290.48 → 10292.96] It's a different kind of thing.
[10293.38 → 10294.94] But, yeah, I don't know.
[10294.98 → 10296.18] I like brick and mortar as well.
[10296.22 → 10299.36] If I have a brick and mortar option, I'll pretty much always take it.
[10299.62 → 10302.14] One of my issues with brick and mortar as it is right now,
[10302.34 → 10308.34] when there's something that I haven't bought a lot of, I don't know where to go.
[10309.04 → 10309.74] Yeah, it's tough.
[10310.70 → 10313.34] Like, just random, like, household things.
[10313.80 → 10314.04] Yeah.
[10314.08 → 10315.26] Where do you go for, like, a whisk?
[10315.50 → 10315.86] I don't know.
[10316.22 → 10316.58] Exactly.
[10316.58 → 10316.94] Yeah.
[10317.02 → 10318.54] Not Williams-Sonoma, I'll tell you that much.
[10318.94 → 10319.68] I don't even know what that is.
[10319.88 → 10320.06] Yeah.
[10320.20 → 10323.84] I talked about it on Wend Show recently, but it was the place that we got the blender from
[10323.84 → 10325.68] for our wedding that we went in.
[10325.78 → 10326.36] I remember that.
[10326.36 → 10329.96] Like, you know, $400 and walked out with, like, some cookie cutters and, like...
[10329.96 → 10330.98] Yeah, I know the blender story.
[10331.42 → 10331.60] Yeah.
[10331.86 → 10334.58] For me, traditionally, I've always gone to, like, what is it?
[10334.58 → 10335.74] Just, like, Shopper's Drug Mart?
[10335.86 → 10336.16] Oh, yeah.
[10336.20 → 10336.78] Canadian Tire.
[10337.12 → 10337.28] Yeah.
[10337.28 → 10338.06] Just go to Canadian Tire.
[10338.90 → 10339.98] Yeah, but there's stuff other...
[10339.98 → 10341.20] And it's, like, seasonal, too.
[10341.30 → 10343.16] It's like, no, but I want that now.
[10343.56 → 10349.30] And it's like, oh, well, you know, it's hot now, but, you know, it will be cold soon,
[10349.32 → 10351.02] so we don't have any of those anymore.
[10351.14 → 10351.32] Yeah.
[10351.58 → 10353.14] Okay, I mean, I get it, but dang it.
[10353.14 → 10353.90] Oh, you want a pitcher?
[10354.16 → 10358.32] Well, we only carry those in the summer because people make more pitcher drinks in the summer,
[10358.46 → 10358.88] I guess.
[10359.10 → 10360.58] No, I need a pitcher now.
[10360.86 → 10361.12] Yeah.
[10361.96 → 10362.32] Yeah.
[10362.60 → 10362.96] Yeah.
[10363.10 → 10363.34] Yeah.
[10363.58 → 10363.80] Yeah.
[10363.80 → 10364.12] All right.
[10365.70 → 10366.10] Dealers.
[10366.92 → 10368.30] Apparently, it is coming back, actually.
[10368.34 → 10368.74] I know.
[10368.82 → 10369.18] Again.
[10369.18 → 10369.62] Yeah.
[10369.74 → 10370.92] It doesn't need to come back.
[10371.02 → 10371.56] No, it really doesn't.
[10371.56 → 10373.18] Just like Target didn't need to come here.
[10373.26 → 10378.02] We don't have a shortage of places where you can get, like, random household appliances,
[10378.14 → 10383.36] or not appliances, but, like, random housewares for not even great prices.
[10383.72 → 10384.50] Like, it's...
[10384.50 → 10384.88] We're good.
[10386.26 → 10391.84] It's like Canada is not some, like, wasteland with, you know, no options for getting a whisk.
[10392.52 → 10394.08] We have a lot fewer, but they exist.
[10394.20 → 10394.86] Yeah, they're there.
[10395.58 → 10397.98] Just because Luke can't find them doesn't mean they don't exist.
[10397.98 → 10398.72] Oh, 100%.
[10398.72 → 10400.40] The guy doesn't know how to buy things.
[10400.46 → 10401.00] Big surprise.
[10401.20 → 10402.10] He doesn't buy things.
[10402.26 → 10402.50] Yes.
[10402.54 → 10403.44] I could find a whisk.
[10403.74 → 10403.92] Yeah.
[10404.60 → 10406.64] This is the problem.
[10406.92 → 10408.98] Like, I'm not trying to cover it up as something else.
[10408.98 → 10411.26] I don't know where to go.
[10411.26 → 10413.74] All right.
[10413.74 → 10413.80] All right.
[10413.80 → 10419.62] I've actually been, like, musing about this idea, and I'm not going to make it because
[10419.62 → 10421.46] I know I'm the only one that would benefit from it.
[10421.68 → 10427.48] But, like, some type of thing where it's like, I want this thing to tell me where I can buy
[10427.48 → 10429.34] this type of item in my local area.
[10429.94 → 10430.16] Yeah.
[10430.28 → 10431.32] I think that'd be super cool.
[10431.32 → 10432.86] Like, I want a brick-and-mortar alternative.
[10433.06 → 10436.84] Top Gear 1224 says, hey, you need to be nice to Target Canada.
[10436.96 → 10437.60] It was a vibe.
[10438.08 → 10438.20] Yeah.
[10438.22 → 10442.84] The issue with Target Canada is, I think, the same issue that almost everyone who's tried
[10442.84 → 10447.30] to come up into Canada, maybe Home Depot and Walmart were reasonably successful, is they
[10447.30 → 10452.24] come up here going, like, we can bring the, well, they just, like, bought out Future Shop.
[10452.44 → 10453.96] Like, I don't know.
[10454.66 → 10455.72] Competition delete.
[10456.06 → 10456.26] Yeah.
[10456.38 → 10460.68] Future Shop kind of, like, made their own grave by just not adapting.
[10461.06 → 10468.32] But I feel like a lot of the more, like, commodity stores that have tried to come up here and compete
[10468.32 → 10474.48] have assumed that they can, you know, bring their supply chain management and their economies
[10474.48 → 10478.96] of scale into Canada, and it'll work just as well as it does in the US.
[10479.16 → 10485.68] But the issue is that if you come in with this strategy of, like, building megastores and, you
[10485.68 → 10490.76] know, trying to just, like, leverage economies of scale, you're going to run into problems because
[10490.76 → 10493.42] Canada, logistically, is really different from the US.
[10493.66 → 10494.70] We're enormous.
[10495.76 → 10503.88] The population is spread out extremely, extremely far, but, like, horizontally, essentially.
[10503.88 → 10507.88] But then you still, you know, when you look at this population number, if you want to
[10507.88 → 10511.62] access it, you actually have to, like, spread out a lot, even though it's in this, like,
[10511.68 → 10513.42] tiny strip, like, right along the border.
[10513.74 → 10516.64] And then the big thing is that it's not very much.
[10516.78 → 10519.80] Like, there's more people living in the state of California than there are in the entire
[10519.80 → 10520.70] country of Canada.
[10521.24 → 10525.90] And so what works there, where you just plonk down a big box store, like, man, the foot traffic
[10525.90 → 10529.12] in microcentre when I was down there blew my mind.
[10529.12 → 10532.36] I'm thinking, how are there this many people who need a computer right now?
[10533.26 → 10535.40] Like, just blew me away.
[10535.68 → 10537.96] That concept genuinely confused me for a really long time.
[10538.06 → 10539.22] I would see certain stores.
[10539.38 → 10541.44] How does Fry's Electronics exist?
[10541.82 → 10545.82] I would see certain stores and movies, and my American friends would talk about going to
[10545.82 → 10547.90] certain stores, and I'd be like, how do they pay the rent?
[10548.24 → 10549.86] Like, how is there enough people shopping from here?
[10549.86 → 10550.60] And I was just like, oh.
[10551.30 → 10555.64] So what happens is they come up here and figure out, oh, holy crap.
[10555.64 → 10559.24] Our overhead is, like, really high, and the volumes are really low.
[10559.68 → 10564.86] So while we identified this potential for us to come in and undercut these Canadian idiots
[10564.86 → 10569.80] who are charging so much, actually, in order for us to survive here, we have to charge the
[10569.80 → 10573.86] same amount that they do because everything costs so much to operate here.
[10574.26 → 10580.24] Oh, like, New egg, if NCI hadn't completely eaten its own tail, New egg's Canadian launch
[10580.24 → 10581.18] was disastrous.
[10581.34 → 10581.88] It was terrible.
[10582.48 → 10583.96] They just had no idea what they were doing.
[10583.96 → 10586.16] So can you ask...
[10586.16 → 10587.16] Too soon, Fry's.
[10587.18 → 10587.76] Sorry, everyone.
[10587.94 → 10588.86] Can you ask Bing Chat?
[10589.26 → 10590.20] Oh, sure.
[10590.66 → 10593.80] Where to buy a whisk in, like, Coverdale or something?
[10596.50 → 10597.70] Or something like that?
[10597.70 → 10598.02] I don't know.
[10599.50 → 10600.56] Let's go with Spatula.
[10601.12 → 10601.50] Sure.
[10602.22 → 10602.76] A Spatula.
[10604.66 → 10606.72] Where's a good place to buy a spatula near me?
[10607.60 → 10608.22] Near me.
[10608.50 → 10609.68] Does it have location services?
[10609.68 → 10610.06] I don't know.
[10610.12 → 10610.74] Let's find out.
[10610.76 → 10611.00] Yeah.
[10611.30 → 10611.94] Let's go.
[10613.96 → 10616.54] I don't move around.
[10617.20 → 10618.36] Location's literally on Google.
[10619.04 → 10619.78] I have searched the web.
[10619.86 → 10623.32] You could go to Walmart Canada, which has a variety of kitchen spatulas in different sizes,
[10623.46 → 10624.16] shapes, and materials.
[10624.66 → 10625.16] Home Depot?
[10625.16 → 10626.26] Another option is the Home Depot.
[10627.32 → 10627.56] Huh.
[10627.76 → 10628.08] Okay.
[10628.54 → 10629.16] I guess...
[10629.16 → 10629.58] Really?
[10629.58 → 10630.62] Home Depot spatulas?
[10630.62 → 10632.10] Wouldn't it be, like, plaster spatulas?
[10632.28 → 10633.12] Ooh, or, like, barbecue.
[10633.76 → 10633.98] Oh.
[10634.14 → 10634.48] Oh, okay.
[10634.70 → 10635.12] Look at that.
[10635.36 → 10636.16] There's a whole pack of spatulas for...
[10636.16 → 10636.74] What?
[10636.74 → 10637.64] From Home Depot?
[10637.64 → 10640.24] $29 available for pickup.
[10640.38 → 10640.52] Yep.
[10640.66 → 10641.00] There you go.
[10641.20 → 10641.50] All right.
[10641.58 → 10649.96] One thing to note is both of these shops now do online and have it shipped to store.
[10650.92 → 10652.74] Free delivery on orders over $49.
[10653.10 → 10654.66] You can pick up your order at a nearby store.
[10654.88 → 10659.06] But if you wanted one tonight, they might not have it at the store.
[10659.30 → 10659.54] Yeah.
[10659.54 → 10661.02] So you couldn't just go there.
[10661.10 → 10665.14] It also picks two gigantic chains and didn't find any of the like, smaller, more interesting
[10665.14 → 10665.56] shops.
[10665.56 → 10668.58] It's raised in Tarrant.
[10668.78 → 10669.08] All right.
[10669.18 → 10669.38] Hit me.
[10670.40 → 10670.92] Okay.
[10672.44 → 10673.54] Oh, those are incoming.
[10673.66 → 10673.94] Hold on.
[10674.46 → 10676.06] This is from Jacqueline.
[10676.42 → 10681.98] Does AMD sponsorship for Ultimate Tech Upgrade mean upgrade recipients won't be able to pick
[10681.98 → 10683.28] NVIDIA GPUs anymore?
[10683.64 → 10687.48] Or will it just be that one of the components must be AMD?
[10687.74 → 10688.46] I don't know.
[10689.18 → 10693.26] That's a good question, and I will have to get an answer for you on that, maybe in one
[10693.26 → 10693.68] of the videos.
[10693.68 → 10697.18] I mean, I guess you'll see if there's an NVIDIA GPU.
[10697.38 → 10702.46] I wouldn't blame AMD if they were like, hey, we'd really prefer to use Radeon GPUs.
[10702.62 → 10703.36] Yeah, I wouldn't either.
[10704.36 → 10711.02] But also, I think that, you know, giving them too much influence over the part selection
[10711.02 → 10713.08] is going to hurt the integrity of the project.
[10713.08 → 10716.58] Like, with Intel, the only requirement was that we had to use some Intel something.
[10717.06 → 10719.44] So hopefully we've negotiated a similar deal.
[10719.52 → 10720.26] So I guess we'll have to see.
[10721.38 → 10721.52] Okay.
[10721.58 → 10722.30] This one's from Trevor.
[10722.72 → 10723.10] Hey, Linus.
[10723.14 → 10728.90] Just wanted to say I've been a huge fan since about 2012 to 2013, and I'm snatching up the
[10728.90 → 10729.82] tracksuit right now.
[10729.92 → 10730.14] Nice.
[10730.14 → 10734.24] Do you have any other plans for different colour schemes, such as white as the main colour
[10734.24 → 10735.26] and black stripes?
[10735.98 → 10740.22] I think we'd like to do other colour schemes, but that's going to be dependent on the success
[10740.22 → 10743.68] of the, you know, the classic black with the white stripe.
[10744.60 → 10744.96] Okay.
[10745.08 → 10745.96] Got one here from Anonymous.
[10746.30 → 10747.10] This one's kind of, yeah.
[10747.16 → 10751.50] I don't think the other ones would sell anywhere near as well.
[10751.58 → 10754.68] I want the white to be LTT orange.
[10755.68 → 10757.32] Yeah, like that one might do okay.
[10757.86 → 10761.06] But I would hazard against making too many of them, personally.
[10761.44 → 10761.68] Mm-hmm.
[10762.40 → 10762.60] Okay.
[10762.78 → 10763.74] I've got one here from Anonymous.
[10764.00 → 10766.68] I could see us doing limited edition ones once in a while or something like that.
[10766.70 → 10767.12] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10767.12 → 10769.54] Now that we've got the pattern all, like, sorted out.
[10769.64 → 10772.20] Same material as the gold plushier.
[10772.20 → 10776.08] Or you could do the white becomes what you wrapped your car in.
[10776.30 → 10776.50] Oh.
[10777.06 → 10778.20] You haven't seen it yet.
[10778.32 → 10779.04] Yeah, I know I haven't.
[10779.20 → 10779.46] No.
[10779.76 → 10780.08] Okay.
[10780.26 → 10781.88] I want a gold plushier tracksuit.
[10782.52 → 10783.20] I like gold.
[10783.94 → 10784.10] All right.
[10784.12 → 10784.52] Keep it going.
[10784.68 → 10784.98] All right.
[10785.04 → 10785.78] Got one here from Anonymous.
[10786.32 → 10788.48] You mentioned the celebrity component of your life.
[10788.68 → 10793.42] Do you agree with the anecdotal story about Eminem who made a statement to his daughter's
[10793.42 → 10797.02] high school that when he was at school, he was Marshall.
[10797.24 → 10799.28] But if he's outside, he's Eminem.
[10799.28 → 10800.42] Please respect that.
[10801.64 → 10803.24] I don't even know what he's talking about.
[10804.04 → 10804.96] I get it.
[10805.18 → 10806.04] Like, in what way?
[10806.20 → 10807.64] He wants to be referred to as Marshall.
[10808.82 → 10814.44] He doesn't want to be known as his artist's handle when he's dealing with his child's education.
[10814.44 → 10815.88] He's like, dad at school and outside.
[10816.10 → 10818.50] Oh, I kind of thought it was like the other way around.
[10818.84 → 10821.76] I thought he's like, if you see me outside, call me Eminem.
[10821.86 → 10822.48] Respect that.
[10823.18 → 10824.48] I thought it was the...
[10824.48 → 10825.18] Sorry.
[10825.28 → 10826.46] I see what you mean now.
[10826.54 → 10828.26] I thought it was like the other way.
[10828.30 → 10829.38] And I'm sitting here going like...
[10829.38 → 10829.88] That was weird.
[10829.88 → 10830.20] Yeah.
[10831.00 → 10831.66] Who cares?
[10831.76 → 10835.22] Like, if you know people personally, and you see them outside that context in which
[10835.22 → 10835.92] you know them, what?
[10836.20 → 10838.04] All of a sudden, you're not on a first name basis anymore?
[10838.16 → 10839.22] That was the way I took it.
[10839.52 → 10840.82] And that's probably not right.
[10840.90 → 10841.84] I think he's just trying to be professional.
[10842.14 → 10843.18] It makes sense to me.
[10843.54 → 10843.82] Okay.
[10844.08 → 10848.74] I think it would be a little weird if like the teacher of my child was like, yo, slick.
[10849.30 → 10849.52] Yeah.
[10849.60 → 10849.78] No.
[10849.88 → 10850.02] Yeah.
[10850.02 → 10850.70] That's not cool.
[10850.88 → 10851.10] No.
[10851.52 → 10851.70] Yeah.
[10851.82 → 10852.00] Yeah.
[10852.00 → 10852.24] Yeah.
[10852.24 → 10852.38] Yeah.
[10852.38 → 10852.46] Yeah.
[10852.46 → 10852.56] No.
[10852.66 → 10852.92] Yeah.
[10853.02 → 10854.68] That makes total sense to me.
[10854.68 → 10857.10] I've never really had to deal with that.
[10857.30 → 10858.94] Well, your name is the company name.
[10859.08 → 10859.26] Much.
[10859.26 → 10860.16] So it would be impossible.
[10860.48 → 10861.18] Mr. Tips.
[10861.32 → 10861.76] Well, no.
[10861.88 → 10862.26] I don't even mean...
[10862.26 → 10863.76] When I'm talking to you at school, you call me Linus.
[10863.80 → 10865.72] When you see me out on the street, you also call me Linus.
[10865.72 → 10865.94] Yes.
[10865.94 → 10867.02] Please respect that.
[10867.08 → 10867.88] Thank you for that.
[10869.56 → 10871.14] He talks just like that.
[10873.28 → 10875.06] I mean more in terms of like...
[10875.06 → 10876.26] I don't do interpretations.
[10876.50 → 10878.36] You should hear like my mom.
[10881.74 → 10882.62] Impersonations, but yes.
[10882.94 → 10883.72] What did I say?
[10884.18 → 10884.54] Interpretations.
[10885.38 → 10886.70] I'm interpreting for you.
[10886.76 → 10887.44] I'll do interpretations.
[10887.44 → 10887.68] Thanks.
[10887.68 → 10888.82] That was much more like it.
[10888.98 → 10889.14] Yeah.
[10893.66 → 10894.68] It's late, man.
[10894.76 → 10895.16] Whatever.
[10897.04 → 10897.40] Yeah.
[10897.56 → 10902.08] I've never really run into a situation where like a teacher or anything dealing with my
[10902.08 → 10904.02] kids really knows who I am yet.
[10904.10 → 10905.78] So I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
[10906.04 → 10906.24] Yeah.
[10906.78 → 10910.74] But I would, yeah, I would expect them to just call me Linus and treat me totally normally.
[10911.26 → 10912.98] That's what I would hope for.
[10912.98 → 10913.54] Okay.
[10915.24 → 10915.64] Okay.
[10915.82 → 10919.20] And this last one's from Ryan before we move on to potentials.
[10919.58 → 10921.96] Any updates on Luke's crowbar?
[10921.96 → 10926.80] Do you know the update?
[10927.62 → 10928.92] Well, I know an update.
[10929.18 → 10930.36] You know, I don't know if I can say it though.
[10930.48 → 10931.68] Like I actually don't think I can.
[10931.84 → 10936.22] The update is that Nick has forbidden me to talk about the coal bar.
[10937.22 → 10938.32] He has forbidden me.
[10938.32 → 10939.04] Oh, get owned.
[10939.40 → 10939.62] Yeah.
[10939.82 → 10941.16] Are you allowed to talk about the coal bar?
[10941.30 → 10941.84] I don't know.
[10941.98 → 10945.74] But I presume the information that I currently know I would not be allowed to talk about.
[10946.18 → 10947.38] Can you mute us for a second?
[10947.80 → 10948.72] Oh, that's dangerous.
[10949.34 → 10949.60] No, no.
[10949.64 → 10950.24] We got this.
[10950.30 → 10950.80] I can.
[10951.02 → 10952.60] Just hold on until I get this.
[10952.78 → 10953.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10953.36 → 10953.94] We got this.
[10954.04 → 10954.42] We got this.
[10954.44 → 10954.46] Wow.
[10954.46 → 10955.66] I don't like...
[10984.46 → 10991.22] Nick and I bring out talking about it that was.
[10991.36 → 10992.12] Oh, I see.
[10992.24 → 10992.92] But like...
[10992.92 → 10993.18] Hmm.
[10994.96 → 10995.32] Okay.
[10995.54 → 10998.66] Well, I will have to check in with Mr. Nick Light.
[10998.66 → 10999.60] And I would.
[10999.86 → 11003.82] Except that I accidentally left my phone on with TeamViewer open.
[11004.18 → 11007.06] And my battery drained because my screen didn't dim.
[11007.36 → 11008.80] And so my phone is dead.
[11009.46 → 11010.84] So I can't call him now.
[11011.42 → 11012.76] Do you want me to call him?
[11014.46 → 11016.44] Uh, I mean, sure.
[11016.68 → 11017.96] But let's do both of those things.
[11018.10 → 11019.84] Dan, do you mind throwing my phone on the charger?
[11019.84 → 11020.46] Thank you.
[11020.82 → 11021.42] And Luke, yeah.
[11021.48 → 11022.16] Why don't you give him a call?
[11022.18 → 11022.96] I mean, it's pretty late.
[11023.16 → 11023.64] Oh, whatever.
[11023.76 → 11024.94] He's not going to be asleep.
[11025.50 → 11026.36] Bro's a gamer.
[11027.56 → 11028.24] Get real.
[11029.32 → 11033.22] Podcast with no sound is going to be interesting, says AJ in the float plane chat.
[11033.88 → 11034.30] Okay.
[11034.48 → 11034.72] Yeah.
[11036.96 → 11037.36] Hello?
[11037.90 → 11039.10] Hi, this is Luke.
[11042.72 → 11043.46] Hi, Luke.
[11043.46 → 11044.44] What's going on?
[11044.46 → 11046.68] Uh, we're on Landholder.
[11047.76 → 11048.48] Wow.
[11048.98 → 11050.18] Oh, wow.
[11051.80 → 11056.48] Uh, hey, um, so the, uh.
[11056.48 → 11057.18] Good interpretation.
[11057.18 → 11070.56] So anyway, um, the peeps asked for an update on the coal bar and Luke wasn't sure if he's
[11070.56 → 11072.64] allowed to share what you told him.
[11072.64 → 11076.60] So like, does he have a sign-off on that or like, where, where are we at on that?
[11078.32 → 11080.42] Uh, we're talking to them.
[11080.52 → 11081.68] That's about all we can say.
[11081.68 → 11082.52] Okay.
[11082.52 → 11082.58] Okay.
[11082.68 → 11083.02] All right.
[11083.18 → 11083.42] Okay.
[11083.74 → 11084.14] Thanks.
[11084.74 → 11085.10] Okay.
[11085.20 → 11085.60] Bye-bye.
[11085.70 → 11085.92] Okay.
[11086.02 → 11088.12] Um, you, you have a wonderful evening.
[11088.60 → 11089.66] Oh, hey, you too.
[11089.78 → 11090.44] Enjoy the show.
[11090.52 → 11090.94] Oh, yeah.
[11091.06 → 11091.34] Yeah.
[11091.66 → 11091.98] Oh, yeah.
[11091.98 → 11092.44] For sure.
[11092.54 → 11095.16] This is, this is Wan show After Dark, baby.
[11095.66 → 11097.90] Yeah, this seems to be going very well.
[11098.10 → 11098.80] Gone sexual.
[11099.08 → 11099.46] Okay.
[11099.72 → 11099.96] Okay.
[11099.96 → 11100.10] Bye.
[11100.28 → 11100.66] Okay.
[11100.86 → 11101.24] Goodbye.
[11101.24 → 11101.44] Bye.
[11102.44 → 11103.38] There you have it.
[11103.50 → 11108.08] Um, one Mr. Nick Light has not given us the go ahead to talk about any of that.
[11108.08 → 11109.32] All right, Dan, hit us.
[11109.50 → 11110.58] Yeah, I thought that was the case.
[11110.72 → 11110.92] Okay.
[11110.96 → 11112.38] We're into potentials now.
[11112.38 → 11118.24] Uh, Billy is asking, hey, Luke, Linus, and Dan, what is everyone's favourite slash dream
[11118.24 → 11118.62] car?
[11118.80 → 11120.96] Will we get a video on Linus's new car?
[11121.10 → 11124.16] I liked the Ramen Navarre until I found out Andrew Tate had one.
[11126.54 → 11129.54] Now I'm just like, well, apparently that's a car for douchebags.
[11130.68 → 11135.38] And this is coming from someone sitting here in a track seat, not exercising.
[11135.70 → 11136.80] With a raft car outside.
[11136.80 → 11137.58] That you made.
[11138.42 → 11139.44] That I made.
[11139.46 → 11140.98] It's not just your tracksuit.
[11141.06 → 11142.28] It's your tracksuit.
[11142.52 → 11146.88] I actually can't remember the exact name of it, but I think I showed you it because I
[11146.88 → 11148.98] like thought it was cool in Sforza.
[11150.26 → 11150.56] Ooh.
[11150.84 → 11151.14] Yeah.
[11151.26 → 11155.14] I've, I actually remember this interaction, but I do not remember the car.
[11155.24 → 11156.80] No, and I'm not going to remember it either.
[11157.16 → 11158.70] I didn't expect you to remember it to be clear.
[11158.70 → 11160.88] Just go with something cool like a 94 Dodge Viper.
[11161.64 → 11163.68] A 94 Dodge Viper.
[11163.68 → 11167.94] Now, if we're going like retro, it was always the, uh, Super B.
[11169.44 → 11170.38] Charger Super B.
[11170.50 → 11170.68] Okay.
[11170.82 → 11171.64] Loved that car.
[11172.72 → 11176.94] But I mean, it's kind of a boat, so it would probably kind of suck to drive around these
[11176.94 → 11177.16] days.
[11177.24 → 11178.08] I want a Corolla GR.
[11178.08 → 11182.60] If there was like a car that I'd love to just like to rip around in these days.
[11183.28 → 11184.78] Um, that would be sick.
[11185.20 → 11186.92] I always thought the NSX was pretty cool.
[11187.04 → 11188.56] Oh, Chris McKinney brings up a good point.
[11188.64 → 11190.38] Andrew Tate doesn't have any cars now, so.
[11191.48 → 11192.32] Free game.
[11193.04 → 11196.46] Well, he thought it, he thought it was cool at one point.
[11196.50 → 11197.58] Does that, does that ruin it?
[11197.58 → 11199.68] Um, yeah, probably.
[11200.12 → 11201.88] I can run at 3200 megahertz.
[11202.10 → 11203.76] It says slab culture is not donkey.
[11204.22 → 11209.40] Um, not everyone who wears a tracksuit is a slab and plenty of people who wear track
[11209.40 → 11210.24] suits are donkey.
[11210.32 → 11216.18] So it's, it's, they're not, I'm not, we're not drawing overlapping circles here is my point.
[11216.20 → 11219.08] There's tracksuit stereotypes that are far outside.
[11219.12 → 11220.94] And that have nothing to do with slab culture.
[11221.28 → 11221.36] Yeah.
[11221.76 → 11221.96] Yeah.
[11221.96 → 11227.28] I do, the, the pictures on the LTT store were definitely fairly pointed in that direction.
[11227.52 → 11227.80] Yeah.
[11227.92 → 11228.58] But not all of them.
[11228.58 → 11230.24] I think that was just people having fun with it though.
[11230.46 → 11230.66] Yeah.
[11230.96 → 11231.16] Yeah.
[11232.60 → 11233.00] Okay.
[11233.00 → 11233.34] Next one.
[11233.40 → 11234.02] Here's from Annette.
[11234.02 → 11235.74] Uh, pouring one out for Brandon.
[11235.94 → 11236.78] Nearly 10 years.
[11237.30 → 11240.66] Linus and Luke, what were your favourite memories with B-roll, man?
[11240.70 → 11241.78] Oh, that's tough.
[11242.12 → 11245.04] I mean, one that like comes to mind.
[11246.00 → 11249.90] Oh, as I, as I think of one, they're like.
[11249.90 → 11252.36] Starting to hammer.
[11252.48 → 11252.70] Yeah.
[11252.74 → 11253.66] They're coming fast.
[11253.66 → 11253.94] Right.
[11254.00 → 11261.90] Like, ah, I, while you think about that, we had like a lunch to talk about it on the day
[11261.90 → 11264.30] that he departed and I w I was good, man.
[11264.54 → 11268.52] I showed up in, in high spirits, and we were joking the whole time and everything was all
[11268.52 → 11269.72] positive and everything was good.
[11269.86 → 11272.18] And then he made his tweet about how he was leaving.
[11272.54 → 11273.82] I was like, I should probably respond to this.
[11274.16 → 11275.74] And then I like didn't for a while.
[11275.92 → 11279.18] And then I finally was like, okay, I need to respond to this.
[11279.18 → 11279.52] I think.
[11279.66 → 11283.70] So I started trying to dig through old photos and that started to hit pretty hard.
[11284.20 → 11290.54] I didn't cry until right before, um, WAN show.
[11292.00 → 11297.28] And it was like the last time I'd see him in uniform, you know, like didn't have a uniform,
[11297.44 → 11299.54] but like it was the end of the day.
[11299.70 → 11303.56] I think it does help that when we met up on his last day, it was like outside of work.
[11303.74 → 11303.96] Yeah.
[11303.96 → 11306.42] If I had to see him like leave the building, that would probably be.
[11306.88 → 11307.14] Yeah.
[11307.16 → 11308.32] Well, that's pretty big.
[11308.52 → 11308.72] Yeah.
[11308.72 → 11310.18] It was on his way out the door.
[11310.44 → 11310.64] Yeah.
[11310.64 → 11316.00] And it didn't help that when I walked out, Yvonne's face was already like tear stained, and I was
[11316.00 → 11317.28] like, Oh, it's goodbye time.
[11318.34 → 11318.74] Yeah.
[11319.70 → 11319.90] Yeah.
[11320.00 → 11324.06] Um, man, what, what is there to, I know what mine is.
[11324.06 → 11324.24] Yeah.
[11324.24 → 11326.84] What is there to not, you know, reflect on?
[11326.84 → 11331.16] Like, I mean, how about, how about that wild?
[11333.76 → 11334.66] I don't know.
[11334.78 → 11338.46] Like, you know, it could be mine.
[11338.68 → 11341.92] If you need time to think, I don't know.
[11341.94 → 11346.66] It's probably easier for me to just verbal diarrhea them out.
[11346.66 → 11346.94] Right.
[11346.94 → 11354.06] Cause like, you know, I, I, I remember, I remember him, I remember so many times telling
[11354.06 → 11358.34] him to stop bringing his own equipment to work and him insisting because he just wanted
[11358.34 → 11359.16] things to be better.
[11359.32 → 11365.26] You know, I remember the first time he worked with us, just clearly thinking we had no idea
[11365.26 → 11369.44] what we were doing, but putting up with us anyway, he like didn't even get paid for it.
[11369.44 → 11374.78] He was, he was considered OG, even though he didn't start working here till four or five
[11374.78 → 11381.78] months in because he actually did do something for us before the company formally started
[11381.78 → 11382.20] working.
[11382.50 → 11388.10] Um, I'll always remember, uh, the fight he had with me when I like tried to get him to
[11388.10 → 11391.22] stop at seven B roll shots, like back in the Langley house.
[11391.44 → 11392.96] And he was like, no, it needs more.
[11393.00 → 11393.68] It has to be better.
[11393.76 → 11397.50] I'm like, dude, it's like seven 30 and like Baron needs to go home.
[11397.56 → 11398.50] He's editing this video.
[11398.50 → 11400.90] We can't leave till it's done that you have to stop shooting.
[11401.44 → 11406.72] You know, like I remember those marathon build guide shoots, man, it was always me and
[11406.72 → 11409.02] Brandon just marathon build guide shoots.
[11409.02 → 11412.12] We would start as early as we could, and we would end when we, when it ended.
[11412.96 → 11419.68] Um, you know, this, the, the late nights, you know, just chatting on trips, like we, we
[11419.68 → 11420.96] travelled the world together, right?
[11420.96 → 11427.30] Like that's something that, um, is a little different from, I think most coworker interactions.
[11427.30 → 11430.14] Um, yeah, I love Brandon forever.
[11430.30 → 11433.98] Like there's no, there's no HR response here.
[11434.12 → 11434.96] Like we're good.
[11435.08 → 11435.48] Don't worry.
[11435.80 → 11439.40] Um, and, uh, if anything, I hope we get closer.
[11439.40 → 11446.56] Um, yeah, I'm not saying anything that I haven't already said to him personally.
[11446.56 → 11450.16] Like I'm not just trying to, you know, make a video about it or whatever.
[11450.28 → 11451.76] I wasn't really even going to bring it up.
[11451.76 → 11455.92] Uh, just because like our official policy is that we don't really acknowledge this stuff
[11455.92 → 11456.20] anymore.
[11456.20 → 11460.82] We don't talk about HR related issues, but Brandon's not a human resource.
[11461.14 → 11463.20] Um, Brandon's more of a more of a friend.
[11463.32 → 11469.16] And I don't mean that personally, um, for like anyone else, I'm not saying you're not
[11469.16 → 11469.50] a friend.
[11469.50 → 11473.72] I'm just saying that as a founding member of the company, I think it's probably okay for
[11473.72 → 11475.24] me to acknowledge his departure.
[11475.24 → 11475.72] Yeah.
[11475.74 → 11481.34] There are certain things that get when you're literally day zero, there are certain things
[11481.34 → 11482.14] that are a little special.
[11482.14 → 11482.50] Yeah.
[11482.64 → 11492.70] Mine is, um, the first Computer trip because I like knew Brandon, but at the first Computer
[11492.70 → 11494.80] trip, the B team was formed.
[11495.28 → 11495.90] The B team.
[11496.00 → 11498.70] Which was like, and that was, that was a.
[11498.96 → 11498.98] Sorry.
[11499.26 → 11501.26] We did actually call them the B team.
[11501.64 → 11501.94] Yeah.
[11501.94 → 11507.36] Well, it's basically on that, that was still when things were, things have been sink or
[11507.36 → 11509.98] swim quite a few times, but that was when it was like.
[11512.34 → 11513.38] It was scary.
[11513.70 → 11514.40] Sink or swim.
[11514.50 → 11517.24] And you have lots of added weights dangling from you.
[11517.32 → 11517.46] Yeah.
[11517.66 → 11521.80] Um, and I had barely hosted anything.
[11522.08 → 11522.52] Yeah.
[11522.88 → 11525.70] Like you were kind of thrown to the wolves, but I was stuck.
[11526.12 → 11528.80] I had to do all those stupid sponsored things for WD.
[11529.02 → 11529.24] Yeah.
[11529.44 → 11531.78] Like it was, it was a really rough trip.
[11531.94 → 11537.44] I had never done a show of any kind and I had basically never hosted anything.
[11538.18 → 11542.06] Um, most of my experience at that point was WAN show, which is pretty much as far away
[11542.06 → 11543.90] from live content as you could possibly get.
[11544.10 → 11548.18] But I had been around this guy for a while and like, I don't know, whatever.
[11548.68 → 11553.78] And Linus was like, all right, it's Linus and Easel versus Luke and Brandon.
[11553.78 → 11556.42] And that was probably the smartest thing you could have done at that point in time.
[11556.56 → 11558.22] Because he made it like this war.
[11558.74 → 11563.26] And I was like, well, it's Brandon and me, we have to figure this out.
[11563.40 → 11564.70] We have to do this well.
[11564.70 → 11567.40] And like, no one knows who the hell I am.
[11567.88 → 11571.52] So I'm just showing up to booths being like, I swear I'm a part of this channel.
[11572.12 → 11575.14] Like, can we please make these videos?
[11575.76 → 11578.74] And Brandon completely matched my energy.
[11579.44 → 11582.30] And I know I can be like a little hardcore sometimes.
[11582.30 → 11588.96] So when people do match my energy, it's really uncommon that a bond is not formed.
[11589.20 → 11589.32] Yeah.
[11589.66 → 11595.62] Um, and he matched my energy then and then matched my energy every single time we ever did a road trip
[11595.62 → 11597.44] for the many years beyond there.
[11597.44 → 11600.02] And we like were the road team at one point in time.
[11600.02 → 11604.42] We were the only people that did remote coverage unless it was like something really special.
[11605.14 → 11610.26] Um, and that was like, I don't know, just Brandon and I did everything together for a long time.
[11611.16 → 11611.60] Yeah.
[11611.60 → 11620.94] I think one of the reasons why the closure is probably easier for me is my kind of departure to float plane was kind of the disconnection of that team already.
[11621.26 → 11622.24] You left him.
[11622.40 → 11623.26] He didn't leave you.
[11623.34 → 11623.74] Basically.
[11623.92 → 11624.08] Yeah.
[11624.10 → 11624.52] Well, yeah.
[11624.92 → 11626.54] So like, yeah.
[11627.66 → 11629.84] Uh, no, Brandon did not die.
[11630.40 → 11633.40] He's alive and very well.
[11633.48 → 11633.84] Thriving.
[11633.98 → 11634.10] Yeah.
[11634.20 → 11634.38] Yep.
[11636.86 → 11637.34] Jeez.
[11637.98 → 11638.56] All right.
[11638.80 → 11640.46] I don't know what to follow that with.
[11640.46 → 11642.56] Um, that was something a little bit lighter.
[11642.68 → 11643.42] Hold on one sec.
[11643.52 → 11646.28] What if I derail us back to the dock for a quick second?
[11646.28 → 11649.58] Cause people keep on shouting out that we've missed a topic.
[11650.42 → 11650.82] Um.
[11651.16 → 11651.66] Oh yeah.
[11651.66 → 11653.18] We missed a boring one.
[11653.18 → 11653.58] I think.
[11653.92 → 11656.04] What about the underwear topic?
[11658.34 → 11658.74] Oh.
[11659.52 → 11660.66] We never talked about it.
[11660.80 → 11661.84] We didn't talk about that.
[11662.06 → 11662.26] Yeah.
[11662.26 → 11662.36] Yeah.
[11662.36 → 11663.92] The audience is right.
[11668.08 → 11669.92] Surely this would have secured the deal.
[11670.82 → 11674.64] Went home with a guy, and he was wearing Linus Tech Tips underwear.
[11675.38 → 11675.70] Help.
[11675.70 → 11684.12] Apparently Leeds Fess is a group for anonymous admissions for the University of Leeds where
[11684.12 → 11688.58] an unknown lady and or gentleman stumbled upon some sweet LTT merch.
[11689.10 → 11691.60] This was reposted to the LTT Reddit.
[11694.70 → 11696.06] There are some great comments.
[11696.24 → 11697.24] Uh, did he drop you?
[11697.74 → 11701.38] Uh, should have abruptly ended the date with, that's cute.
[11701.38 → 11703.42] Just like this message from our sponsor.
[11704.66 → 11705.08] Um.
[11705.88 → 11708.44] What, what, what was the question that we had around this?
[11708.54 → 11709.14] Oh yes.
[11709.26 → 11710.18] Discussion question.
[11710.36 → 11710.88] Thank you.
[11710.88 → 11711.80] Uh, Wan show writer.
[11712.24 → 11714.06] Will LTT merch get you laid?
[11714.40 → 11715.00] Yes or no?
[11715.80 → 11718.12] Given our audience demographics.
[11719.38 → 11721.10] I think if you are.
[11723.00 → 11723.48] Attract.
[11724.82 → 11726.16] Given our audience demographics.
[11728.86 → 11730.64] If you are a fan of the show.
[11731.02 → 11731.32] Yeah.
[11731.38 → 11733.48] And you are attracted to males.
[11733.92 → 11734.24] Mm-hmm.
[11734.98 → 11735.42] Probably.
[11737.94 → 11738.34] Yeah.
[11738.46 → 11739.90] Outside that and maybe not.
[11740.38 → 11740.62] Yeah.
[11740.62 → 11742.84] One thing that I find is interesting is they recognize it clearly.
[11744.06 → 11744.44] Yeah.
[11744.60 → 11745.66] So that's, that, okay.
[11745.80 → 11746.46] So that's the thing.
[11746.52 → 11748.16] That part has been interesting to me the whole time.
[11748.36 → 11749.12] They were jealous.
[11751.40 → 11753.38] And they like to read it.
[11754.04 → 11754.44] Right?
[11755.18 → 11756.16] I mean, I guess so.
[11756.18 → 11757.40] It's on the waistband though.
[11757.40 → 11759.56] The new ones are just like a.
[11760.44 → 11761.16] Oh, well.
[11761.16 → 11761.88] Rubberized symbol.
[11761.88 → 11761.90] Okay.
[11761.90 → 11767.52] They didn't say if it was the ones with the text across the waistband or if it was one of the newer ones that just had a little.
[11767.52 → 11768.66] The symbols are more tasteful.
[11768.66 → 11769.18] Rubber stamp.
[11769.40 → 11769.56] Yeah.
[11770.06 → 11770.38] Um.
[11773.32 → 11774.34] Should we poll it?
[11774.62 → 11778.10] It is polling our, our audience, which is not, you know, entirely fair.
[11778.22 → 11779.48] But I think we should do it anyway.
[11779.94 → 11780.44] Would you be.
[11780.76 → 11781.60] So what is the question?
[11781.66 → 11784.22] Are you more turned on if they have line of executives underwear?
[11784.64 → 11785.00] Sure.
[11785.22 → 11785.52] Yeah.
[11785.66 → 11785.84] Yeah.
[11786.02 → 11786.38] Yeah.
[11786.54 → 11786.80] Yeah.
[11786.82 → 11788.54] That's what, I think that's what we need to know.
[11795.28 → 11795.86] Uh-oh.
[11795.86 → 11801.70] In 50 MN 14 C in float plane chat says, I mean, my wife knows who you guys are.
[11802.22 → 11803.48] So who was she with then?
[11803.48 → 11811.02] Oh, shoot.
[11811.08 → 11812.26] What time did I set for that?
[11813.20 → 11814.02] Are you more turned?
[11814.08 → 11814.24] Okay.
[11814.24 → 11816.18] Well, here, let's just, let's see the results of the poll.
[11817.14 → 11817.66] I mean, yeah.
[11817.70 → 11817.72] Yeah.
[11817.72 → 11819.34] See, for our audience, that's what I was saying.
[11819.46 → 11819.60] Yeah.
[11819.68 → 11819.86] Yeah.
[11819.98 → 11822.96] 65% more turned on if they have LTT underwear.
[11823.10 → 11823.44] Absolutely.
[11823.70 → 11823.94] Okay.
[11824.00 → 11825.68] So you heard it here first, folks.
[11826.32 → 11826.72] Um.
[11827.00 → 11827.70] LTT underwear.
[11827.86 → 11829.74] More likely to turn someone on.
[11830.14 → 11832.32] If they're also in LTT.
[11832.46 → 11833.10] Well, yes.
[11833.40 → 11835.42] But, I mean, that's fine.
[11835.64 → 11835.82] Yeah.
[11835.92 → 11836.20] Why not?
[11836.40 → 11838.34] You already know you have so much in common.
[11841.22 → 11841.62] Yeah.
[11842.20 → 11842.68] All right.
[11842.68 → 11843.46] Next, uh.
[11844.98 → 11845.96] Next merge message.
[11845.96 → 11846.26] Dan?
[11847.04 → 11847.76] Uh, sure.
[11848.08 → 11849.32] Uh, this is from Ryan.
[11849.76 → 11850.88] Hey, Linus and Luke.
[11850.96 → 11853.94] A long time fan of the show from the Langley House days.
[11854.28 → 11857.92] What is the one place you haven't travelled to yet that you really want to?
[11858.30 → 11859.04] I want to go to Australia.
[11859.22 → 11860.52] I want to go scuba diving in Australia.
[11863.20 → 11866.04] That sucks because that was literally my exact answer.
[11866.22 → 11868.22] God, I hope you could go together.
[11868.62 → 11869.06] Yeah.
[11869.16 → 11870.34] Including the scuba thing.
[11870.68 → 11871.62] I don't think we've, have we?
[11871.76 → 11872.02] I don't know.
[11872.82 → 11875.06] I don't think we dived in Mexico together.
[11875.42 → 11875.78] Yeah, we did.
[11875.78 → 11876.42] I went with Dennis.
[11877.50 → 11877.88] Oh.
[11880.20 → 11883.88] I was a layer higher.
[11884.36 → 11885.02] Oh, that's right.
[11885.12 → 11886.16] You couldn't go deep.
[11886.42 → 11886.62] Yeah.
[11886.76 → 11887.28] I remember.
[11887.44 → 11888.72] I do now, but I didn't back then.
[11888.72 → 11890.52] So you were there, but we didn't go together.
[11890.74 → 11890.94] Yeah.
[11891.08 → 11891.70] You, yeah.
[11891.80 → 11892.62] I did like the lame one.
[11892.64 → 11893.80] Your version was not as cool.
[11893.80 → 11895.28] I watched you guys have fun.
[11895.44 → 11895.68] Yeah.
[11896.10 → 11897.10] We really did.
[11897.28 → 11897.44] Yeah.
[11897.62 → 11898.32] It was a great dive.
[11898.32 → 11903.00] It was good enough that it inspired me to like go get my stuff and stuff because I enjoyed
[11903.00 → 11906.56] my experience and was able to see you guys having more fun.
[11906.74 → 11907.70] So I was like, well, okay.
[11908.24 → 11909.10] Might as well get my stuff.
[11909.12 → 11909.24] Yeah.
[11909.24 → 11910.06] Our dive was a lot better.
[11910.28 → 11910.44] Yeah.
[11910.64 → 11910.82] Yeah.
[11911.18 → 11911.44] Cool.
[11911.44 → 11917.02] Diving with Dennis as my dive partner, a little scary.
[11918.44 → 11920.48] He can be very competent though.
[11920.78 → 11921.04] Yes.
[11922.24 → 11924.34] But sometimes he can not.
[11924.34 → 11926.26] I think I've told this story before.
[11926.44 → 11926.64] Yeah.
[11928.08 → 11929.08] There was a trip.
[11929.82 → 11931.94] I think, was it that first Computer trip?
[11932.58 → 11933.10] I don't know.
[11933.14 → 11933.72] I don't remember.
[11934.18 → 11936.08] No, it must've been the second one.
[11936.92 → 11941.88] But Brandon and I went to Taiwan and Dennis was there, but he didn't work with us yet.
[11946.58 → 11948.54] And this was the first time I had met him.
[11948.54 → 11954.60] And then when he came to work with us locally in BC, I genuinely had a like, what?
[11955.56 → 11957.44] Seemed like a totally different person.
[11959.10 → 11960.20] I don't know what to tell you.
[11960.26 → 11961.10] I don't know what it is.
[11961.70 → 11962.64] I don't know what to tell you.
[11962.84 → 11963.32] I don't know.
[11964.34 → 11964.90] All right.
[11964.92 → 11967.28] We have like a new version of Dennis.
[11967.40 → 11968.62] You haven't dodged the question though.
[11968.98 → 11969.20] Oh.
[11970.06 → 11972.10] So I can't say Australia is scuba diving?
[11972.30 → 11973.48] I mean, you can, but it's like.
[11973.60 → 11974.42] A bit of a cop out.
[11976.98 → 11977.50] Hang on.
[11978.54 → 11979.54] I already did Japan.
[11979.62 → 11984.10] I've been quite privileged through work because I've gone to a lot of the places that I wanted to go.
[11984.28 → 11985.26] I always want to go to Taiwan.
[11985.46 → 11986.40] I always want to go to Japan.
[11986.54 → 11987.74] Do you want to do South America at all?
[11988.82 → 11992.16] What about like, you know, somewhere unconventional, like Antarctica or like.
[11992.42 → 11993.72] I'm interested in Antarctica.
[11994.16 → 11996.14] I've been interested in Southern Chile.
[11996.66 → 11996.98] Okay.
[11997.24 → 11999.36] Because there's some like fascinating hiking that's there.
[11999.60 → 11999.74] Yeah.
[12001.48 → 12003.02] I've been to a bunch of the Nordics.
[12003.12 → 12003.78] I've been to Iceland.
[12003.78 → 12004.78] Yeah.
[12008.78 → 12009.34] I don't know.
[12009.52 → 12009.82] All right.
[12009.86 → 12010.28] That's fine.
[12010.32 → 12010.68] I give up.
[12010.80 → 12011.00] Okay.
[12011.16 → 12011.74] Dan, hit us.
[12012.22 → 12012.62] Okay.
[12013.18 → 12015.46] This one is from Hiring.
[12016.06 → 12016.92] Hi, Linus and Luke.
[12017.08 → 12020.10] Love from Taiwan and the, oh, you moved it.
[12020.52 → 12022.60] Love from Taiwan and the Saturday morning.
[12023.16 → 12025.50] What's your fondest memories visiting Taiwan?
[12025.70 → 12028.38] Any food or places that you wish to eat or go against?
[12028.52 → 12029.08] Soup dumplings.
[12029.24 → 12029.66] Let's go.
[12029.78 → 12030.96] Oh, and playing badminton.
[12031.44 → 12035.24] My last trip there, I played seven times in six days.
[12035.90 → 12038.10] I went hard and shot videos.
[12038.24 → 12039.38] That was basically all I did.
[12039.42 → 12040.64] I worked and played badminton.
[12040.84 → 12041.16] That was it.
[12041.16 → 12041.62] I remember this.
[12041.98 → 12043.54] I absolutely love Taiwan.
[12044.10 → 12048.02] Ever since the first time we went there, I've pretty much taken a week off every single time I've gone there.
[12048.02 → 12050.60] to, like, just hang out there a little bit longer.
[12052.28 → 12053.04] Fondest memories?
[12054.26 → 12054.76] I don't know.
[12054.84 → 12055.36] There's a lot.
[12055.66 → 12060.38] Going river tracing in Hu alien, I'm sure I butchered that name.
[12060.40 → 12061.06] Yeah, that was probably awful.
[12061.18 → 12062.62] But it's in eastern Taiwan.
[12063.44 → 12066.32] But going river tracing there was absolutely amazing.
[12067.60 → 12070.32] And, yeah, I'll just stick with that one.
[12073.86 → 12076.94] Do you want a minute to go through those, or should I pick off some more?
[12076.94 → 12078.46] No, just start picking them.
[12078.52 → 12078.82] I don't care.
[12078.92 → 12079.54] Luke can pick them.
[12079.66 → 12080.76] This one's from Ryan.
[12081.16 → 12083.16] Yo, so happy this was released.
[12083.50 → 12086.16] I'm going to use this as the Pokémon Playmate.
[12086.92 → 12087.86] Stealth desk pad?
[12088.02 → 12089.04] I think so, yeah.
[12089.50 → 12093.48] What does a product slash video that you are proud to have worked on that doesn't get enough attention?
[12097.22 → 12101.08] You know what's a really cool video that didn't get enough attention?
[12101.08 → 12105.30] The one on the future of display technology that James wrote a while back.
[12105.30 → 12109.64] The reason it's on my mind is that someone specifically flagged it for me saying,
[12109.78 → 12110.94] wow, this was like a really great video.
[12110.96 → 12115.58] And I sent it to him because he was so discouraged that he spent a ton of time making it not just really informative,
[12115.76 → 12117.08] but super engaging to watch.
[12117.22 → 12119.58] And it really didn't perform very well on the channel.
[12120.28 → 12120.86] So there.
[12121.12 → 12122.12] I'm going to go with that one.
[12122.80 → 12123.28] Float plane.
[12123.28 → 12125.28] Float plane.
[12126.48 → 12126.92] Wow.
[12128.12 → 12129.18] That one hits.
[12132.28 → 12133.90] I'm just going to avoid that.
[12136.18 → 12137.24] This one's from Will.
[12137.38 → 12139.26] Long time watcher, first time merch message.
[12139.40 → 12141.86] I'm excited about the tracksuit desk pad at all.
[12142.64 → 12148.66] Also excited to see how ML slash chatbot assisted search is going to change how people operate on the internet.
[12148.66 → 12153.16] What do you think is going to be the largest cultural change to come from it?
[12154.78 → 12162.22] Well, we're all going to interact with chats instead of, you know, with like SEO optimized Boolean, you know, whatever.
[12162.70 → 12168.08] There's been this whole conversation about how we are all to a certain degree cyborg due to our phones.
[12168.80 → 12169.40] Have you heard this?
[12169.64 → 12169.78] Yep.
[12169.78 → 12175.08] But I think a really large extension of that has been search.
[12175.78 → 12185.90] Search, I think in more ways than people like actively, consciously realize, has shaped how people interact with the modern world.
[12186.28 → 12189.74] Even if your search is this thing, whatever, Reddit.
[12189.98 → 12191.88] Or this thing, whatever, TikTok.
[12192.16 → 12196.32] Because you don't trust Google to give you the right result anymore, which is like actually a problem.
[12196.32 → 12210.64] But even with that, it shapes how people research or look into things, which is genuinely an extremely significant part of what people do to like to grow in almost any way.
[12211.16 → 12214.74] And changing that is going to be wildly impactful.
[12216.14 → 12217.56] I've got one for you, Dan.
[12218.22 → 12220.42] Oh, you are going to make me talk about this, aren't you?
[12220.48 → 12220.98] I saw it coming.
[12220.98 → 12222.18] I thought I would include it.
[12222.18 → 12224.24] Hi, Linus Luke, and particularly Dan.
[12224.36 → 12230.24] Why is there always such strong pushback anytime a Goal gets mentioned to try to fix the audio and sensor button issues?
[12231.50 → 12231.90] Control.
[12232.62 → 12233.66] It's just control.
[12233.76 → 12234.68] It's fine.
[12235.10 → 12237.54] I will throw some pushback against this, personally.
[12237.92 → 12238.24] Fine.
[12239.48 → 12245.10] My Goal bricked itself almost immediately upon getting to my house.
[12245.38 → 12248.10] I contacted their support, and they were like, wow, I've never seen this before.
[12248.30 → 12250.14] And they sent me a new one, to be clear.
[12250.14 → 12251.56] I don't know if they knew who I was or not.
[12251.98 → 12254.16] I didn't reach out on official handles.
[12254.62 → 12255.62] But my name was there.
[12255.90 → 12256.14] Okay.
[12256.40 → 12257.60] I don't know if they figured it out or not.
[12257.70 → 12259.72] But they like immediately sent me a new one.
[12260.56 → 12261.50] It then works.
[12261.82 → 12266.50] But, you know, if it loses power randomly, the profile is just gone.
[12267.00 → 12267.38] That's true.
[12267.54 → 12268.16] That is a flaw.
[12268.62 → 12268.90] Why?
[12269.56 → 12270.36] I don't know.
[12271.50 → 12273.62] If we lose power during the show.
[12273.62 → 12273.78] You can save the profile and load it.
[12274.26 → 12275.48] And then, uh.
[12275.94 → 12277.90] Like, I have my profiles backed up on my NAS.
[12278.68 → 12279.78] So maybe you should just get good.
[12279.78 → 12280.54] That's crazy.
[12280.84 → 12282.02] And you shouldn't have to do that.
[12283.74 → 12284.36] I blame Luke.
[12284.42 → 12287.48] I don't think that if it loses power.
[12287.62 → 12289.98] It's like blaming Microsoft because you forgot to press Ctrl S.
[12291.56 → 12292.36] That's also Luke's fault.
[12292.36 → 12293.64] You should be able to do that.
[12294.04 → 12295.76] It has an autosave feature.
[12295.76 → 12301.04] So one thing that drives me crazy about it is that its physical buttons are basically just for show.
[12301.04 → 12307.86] Because, like, if it loses its memory, it's like, okay, but all your stuff is where it was before.
[12308.02 → 12310.30] You should be able to detect where it was.
[12310.36 → 12310.66] It should be fine.
[12310.66 → 12311.32] It's not perfect.
[12312.18 → 12312.44] Yeah.
[12312.56 → 12313.30] It's not perfect.
[12313.64 → 12313.78] Yeah.
[12313.78 → 12318.56] And one of the reasons that I like this set as well is, you know, I had to mute you guys.
[12318.96 → 12319.18] Right?
[12319.28 → 12322.06] And so what you guys could do for your mutes is pull all the faders down.
[12322.22 → 12326.04] And then when you were unmuted, you know, I got to bring them back up, and they need to be at the same level.
[12326.28 → 12328.10] You know, this is, it's all set.
[12328.58 → 12331.16] And it's kind of set it and forget it kind of thing.
[12331.64 → 12333.28] And it wasn't for a long time.
[12333.34 → 12334.10] It wasn't for a long time.
[12334.12 → 12335.32] Which is why I kept bringing it up.
[12335.50 → 12335.84] But, okay.
[12336.02 → 12336.20] Yeah.
[12336.58 → 12338.74] Luke fixed that, actually.
[12338.86 → 12340.06] It's been pretty good the last two shows.
[12340.10 → 12341.94] And the last two shows is since he's had time.
[12341.94 → 12348.80] I have some incredibly complex audio routing going on behind the scenes to make sure that you can monitor what you need to monitor.
[12349.10 → 12350.62] What goes out to stream is different.
[12351.24 → 12353.24] And if we have guests on, they can hear you.
[12353.32 → 12356.16] But you can't hear you even though it's in the same computer.
[12356.16 → 12361.02] It's like I have five or six different mixes and submixes.
[12361.02 → 12367.00] And then I also have a completely separate submit for me to be able to monitor what's going out to stream.
[12367.62 → 12370.10] So we don't have those echo issues anymore.
[12370.84 → 12375.22] Because unlike OBS, I can now actually monitor the audio that's going out to stream.
[12376.92 → 12377.38] Yeah.
[12377.52 → 12378.22] More control.
[12378.38 → 12378.80] Better.
[12379.46 → 12380.24] Simpler.
[12380.40 → 12382.30] It has to get more complicated to get simpler.
[12382.82 → 12383.64] Goal is great.
[12384.32 → 12387.20] The bleep button was incredibly irritating for a long time for me.
[12387.20 → 12389.60] This new system is very robust.
[12390.28 → 12392.92] And what it also does is it mutes all the other microphones.
[12393.38 → 12400.76] So when Linus is swearing, you can't get the swear underneath the bleep from Luke or my microphone.
[12400.94 → 12401.44] That sort of thing.
[12403.46 → 12403.86] I don't know.
[12404.00 → 12404.88] There's a little explanation.
[12405.30 → 12407.04] I could probably talk about it for an hour.
[12407.58 → 12408.54] Yeah, that won't be necessary.
[12408.80 → 12409.12] At me.
[12409.22 → 12409.42] Goodbye.
[12411.42 → 12414.26] Just disappears himself.
[12414.98 → 12415.38] Beautiful.
[12417.20 → 12419.42] TJ Music Studio asks,
[12419.56 → 12422.62] Ever since your photo shoot, I've been looking for a good emulator.
[12422.76 → 12424.60] Do you have any good tech suggestions for them?
[12424.70 → 12426.14] I trust your opinion more than Bing.
[12426.64 → 12429.00] No, I don't have a suggestion for a good one.
[12429.10 → 12431.38] I'm not that pleased with the one I have, and I've only tried one.
[12431.82 → 12433.62] So that's where we're at on that.
[12433.78 → 12434.66] Archived!
[12434.90 → 12436.78] And finally, last two.
[12437.34 → 12437.96] Kyle asks,
[12438.08 → 12440.86] Can we get an update on the gold paint fading issue on the water bottles?
[12440.86 → 12442.32] I'm hoping to pick up a new one soon.
[12442.42 → 12444.30] But the colours I want, I'll use the gold paint.
[12444.70 → 12445.58] They fade.
[12445.58 → 12448.30] If you have acid hands, they will fade pretty quickly.
[12448.44 → 12451.22] And if you do not, then they actually last quite a long time.
[12451.32 → 12453.82] But it seems to be kind of luck of the draw.
[12453.96 → 12458.36] And whether your particular composition of skin oils is going to wear it away.
[12459.22 → 12462.14] We just basically have a disclaimer on the page that says,
[12462.26 → 12464.60] Hey, yeah, these inks just don't last as long.
[12464.60 → 12467.30] So there's that.
[12467.94 → 12470.18] And finally, Daniel P asks,
[12470.54 → 12476.32] As a fellow creator, I would like to know the rationale for why so is banned.
[12476.80 → 12480.26] What other thing have you banned, and what habits have been hard to change?
[12481.24 → 12481.88] This is not good.
[12482.44 → 12486.22] So is banned because it contributes absolutely nothing.
[12486.44 → 12486.88] Try it.
[12487.20 → 12488.74] Start a sentence with the word so.
[12489.18 → 12490.04] Just try it.
[12490.06 → 12490.56] Do it right now.
[12490.60 → 12490.88] I'll wait.
[12490.88 → 12493.72] So what do you think about airplane peanuts?
[12494.16 → 12494.54] Okay.
[12494.84 → 12497.84] Now say that same sentence again without the word so.
[12498.20 → 12499.64] What do you think about airplane peanuts?
[12500.36 → 12503.32] It contributed absolutely nothing.
[12504.60 → 12505.48] So it's banned.
[12505.48 → 12509.58] Which doesn't mean that we can never use it.
[12509.76 → 12512.06] Obviously, in the middle of a sentence, so is fine.
[12513.14 → 12518.96] And there are even situations where we will use it at the beginning of a sentence or beginning of a paragraph.
[12520.18 → 12525.16] But it has to be in the place of a word like therefore.
[12525.90 → 12527.68] Not just as a filler.
[12527.68 → 12534.42] A lot of times people will just put so at the beginning of like every single paragraph.
[12534.72 → 12534.88] Yes.
[12534.88 → 12537.54] It's like, well, that is definitely not necessary.
[12537.76 → 12539.14] So I went to the store.
[12540.66 → 12542.24] So here's the thing.
[12542.86 → 12544.84] So I just don't know.
[12545.42 → 12547.70] It's not helpful.
[12548.08 → 12554.28] And one of the big things that we try to do, especially in our writing here, not necessarily in our live format.
[12554.28 → 12555.56] Guys, we don't script the Sancho.
[12555.66 → 12556.66] He can say so it's banned.
[12556.66 → 12557.38] Yeah.
[12557.82 → 12558.04] Yeah.
[12558.88 → 12563.30] One of the things that we do in our writing is we try to make the videos as information dense as possible.
[12563.44 → 12565.66] So filler words, stuff and things.
[12566.02 → 12571.98] So they all need to go because we're trying to make the video as dense as possible.
[12573.86 → 12574.68] Hi, Tynan.
[12574.78 → 12576.42] And like is never going anywhere.
[12577.30 → 12585.36] That's just part of my completely irremovable part of my personality at this point.
[12586.66 → 12590.70] And I think that's pretty much it for the show today.
[12591.18 → 12591.32] Whoa.
[12591.90 → 12593.34] We will see you again next week.
[12593.58 → 12594.30] Same bad time.
[12594.46 → 12595.18] Same bad channel.
[12596.14 → 12596.66] Bye.
[12596.66 → 12596.90] Bye.
[12596.90 → 12597.90] Bye.
[12603.88 → 12604.88] That was a long show.
[12605.72 → 12606.62] A little long.
[12607.66 → 12608.86] A little on the long side.
[12609.90 → 12610.62] I blame you.
[12610.68 → 12612.48] Four hours and 19 minutes.
[12612.48 → 12614.82] Oh, we need to go for another 40 seconds.
[12614.82 → 12616.32] Oh, that includes the pre-show.
[12617.08 → 12617.52] Oh, okay.
[12617.68 → 12619.24] Well, for the float plane thieves.
[12620.08 → 12621.14] The show's brought to bed for him.
[12621.34 → 12621.84] The Ridge.
[12622.50 → 12623.48] Square space.
[12623.94 → 12624.14] Yeah.
[12624.74 → 12625.08] Okay.
[12626.76 → 12628.68] Let's have 30 seconds of silence.
[12630.56 → 12631.98] Oh, it just sits there like that now?
[12632.12 → 12632.28] Oh.
[12632.84 → 12633.36] Okay.
[12634.50 → 12636.18] Well, no, not really.
[12636.34 → 12637.86] Animated Minus is fine.
[12638.46 → 12639.40] Yeah, got that.
[12639.96 → 12641.36] I love those shirts.
[12641.94 → 12642.12] Yeah.
[12642.38 → 12644.36] That the Pixel guys are wearing.
[12645.08 → 12645.80] Those are classic.
[12645.92 → 12647.38] What's that, a Team Liquid hoodie you're wearing?
[12647.54 → 12647.78] Yeah.
[12648.16 → 12651.52] And that's the original LTT merch item.
[12651.72 → 12652.82] We should reprint it someday.
[12652.92 → 12653.72] It's just a box.
[12653.86 → 12654.06] Yeah.
