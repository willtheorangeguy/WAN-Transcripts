Hey, the judge overruling film studios case story is missing from the timestamp at around 01:57. Pretty important story, please add it ðŸ˜Š

If your wondering why wan show has been feeling weird lately.
-1:10 of show
-1:55 of sponsor spot and merch messages\unplanned content
(Edit: Forgot to take out the proposel segments)
I assume from checking once thats a trend. Seems sound to me ðŸ¤­
I was curious and did the quick math based on timestamps. I was very suprised thats what I found.
