[0.00 → 5.64] The WAN Show! We've got a big show lined up for you guys this week. Lots of topics. Of course,
[5.86 → 10.98] the headline. The PlayStation 5 disc drive requires an internet connection?
[11.66 → 16.24] Are you kidding me? Actually hilarious. Is that actually a thing that happened?
[16.66 → 23.06] Speaking of actual things that happened, did my LG wing arrive, and will I be live
[23.06 → 29.62] swapping the sim from my Note 9 to the LG wing? Yes, I will. We'll get some impressions from me,
[29.62 → 35.40] some impressions from Luke who has never touched a wing. No. Not once in his life.
[35.98 → 40.64] What else we got this week? I don't know if other people are going to find this super cool,
[40.64 → 46.14] but I find it super cool. The IRS pilots direct filing, which is actually a huge deal.
[46.78 → 52.36] Actually for everyone. Okay. Okay, Linus. All right. I know I curated the topics this week.
[52.36 → 57.82] I know it's just oh really that that's your headline. I think that's huge. That's bigger than
[57.82 → 64.90] Nintendo saying no fun allowed. Yes, because that's just the same thing they always say. Yeah, but it's just it's its really awful.
[65.62 → 72.78] What about carriers turning off people's phones in Mexico? Yeah, let's talk about that. All right,
[72.78 → 76.62] we'll talk about that. Okay. Oh, right. I'm supposed to do that's your job.
[76.62 → 105.82] The show is brought to you by Green Man Gaming, Savage Jerky, and PDF. Why don't we jump right into our first topic?
[105.82 → 112.82] I love that you must have been a little bit offline this week because it always makes Sancho more fun when I get to get the genuine
[112.82 → 123.60] reaction from you. The new PS5 Slim appears to require an internet connection in order to pair the console to its
[123.60 → 131.88] removable disk drive. This is according to small print on leaked images of the Modern Warfare 3 PS5 bundle.
[131.88 → 137.88] The quote here, and I've actually I've actually got the image that I can bring up for you guys. The quote here is
[138.64 → 146.94] internet connection required to pair disk drive and PS5 console upon setup. So that's in the font. Yeah
[146.94 → 149.94] There it is
[151.06 → 152.26] What
[152.26 → 152.88] possible
[152.88 → 158.80] justification could there be for this it says in our notes this is likely an authentication step
[158.80 → 169.26] After which an internet connection should not be necessary for the device to function who cares, but that's a perfect question. Who cares is the danger that people will?
[170.52 → 174.36] Find is like a third party external disk drive. Yeah
[174.36 → 178.68] And if they did would that be such a problem? Yeah
[178.68 → 186.30] Like I aren't the days of pirated Blu-rays kind of behind us at this point is that really a major concern?
[186.30 → 196.06] And if it was a major concern wouldn't that happen at such a late stage in the PlayStation 5's life cycle, but it is unlikely to be a major problem
[196.06 → 198.98] Yeah, like I just it seems so weird
[198.98 → 207.94] I don't understand what the difference is between this external drive with presumably I actually don't even know what interface it's using I mean
[207.94 → 209.30] probably
[209.30 → 210.68] USB
[210.68 → 216.64] I mean it could be it could be just using genuinely hilarious if it was like Ethernet like no like a hot plug SATA
[216.64 → 218.64] I think might be more likely
[218.64 → 223.96] He SATA was a thing for a very, very short period of time going to be that it was super cool
[223.96 → 227.56] But it's not like the SATA standard doesn't support hot plugs
[227.56 → 232.78] So there's no reason that it couldn't actually be serial ATA, but what I'm trying to figure out here is
[233.30 → 235.80] Why this would need an extra?
[235.80 → 243.76] validation step compared to if say for example you were to swap the internal Blu-ray reader of a regular PlayStation 5
[243.76 → 252.76] Or maybe it isn't extra I mean maybe this is one of those things where Sony having learned an awful lot about piracy of their games over the last
[252.76 → 259.52] 25 years and when the first PS when did the PS one come out 96?
[259.52 → 261.52] That's 97 oh
[261.52 → 266.82] Man, I I am showing that I do not know my console history here probably what year was it?
[266.82 → 267.60] 94
[267.60 → 275.20] Wow, was it that long ago 30 years of PlayStation just about apparently American debut was 95 that's incredible
[275.20 → 280.78] All right. Yeah, Japanese debut is December of 94 American debut was September of 95 Wow
[280.78 → 288.06] So Sony's learned an awful lot from mod chips and people burning their own PlayStation discs over the years
[288.06 → 294.96] So maybe this is something that they feel is necessary from an anti-piracy standpoint, but I still
[295.64 → 300.62] have to wonder if the long-term impact of this is
[301.58 → 306.86] Ultimately going to be more negative than any possible gain that Sony could get from this
[306.86 → 308.86] I don't be that guy, but I think people are just going to roll over
[309.82 → 313.98] Roll over yeah, what do you mean? I don't think there's going to be enough of a splash
[314.70 → 317.92] Well, oh, okay. No, I agree. I agree with you a hundred percent
[317.92 → 320.76] but when I say long-term impact I mean when this
[321.36 → 327.58] PS5 slim that you ultimately paid more money for because if you want to get the optical disc add-on
[327.74 → 333.72] Like down the road you actually end up paying more than the cost of a regular PS5 with the optical disc drive
[333.72 → 340.28] Included could end up becoming a paperweight in the future if for whatever reason Sony decided to turn off their own education
[340.28 → 345.16] Servers and your disc drive dies, and you know, we kind of go. Oh, yeah
[345.16 → 349.88] But I mean what are the odds that no the odds are perfect? Oh, I pretty much guarantee that'll happen
[349.88 → 353.96] I don't know when but like however now that PlayStation and
[354.52 → 356.52] Boxes are basically just computers
[356.52 → 362.12] I do think that forward and backward compatibility of games is going to improve a lot
[362.12 → 366.28] So I don't think that it's a huge deal in the same way that if let's say
[367.96 → 372.92] Okay, what's a what's a device that has been notoriously difficult to emulate PlayStation 3 okay?
[372.92 → 377.92] Like I don't think it's going to be as bad as if a PlayStation 3 required an internet connection
[377.92 → 385.34] And then the authentication servers turned off and there was no way to deal with a broken optical drive because there could conceivably be games that
[385.34 → 394.62] Cannot now and maybe can never be experienced in their full proper fidelity without functioning original hardware
[394.62 → 396.62] But with the PS5 I do
[398.54 → 402.14] I do see this as being a little bit less likely
[402.46 → 403.58] This is interesting
[403.58 → 409.18] A scene in float plane chat suggests that maybe it's the movie studios that are requiring it in some way
[409.18 → 416.62] But I honestly find that pretty hard to believe because it's not like you can't still play back a Blu-ray disc in a computer
[416.62 → 418.46] For example, you just require
[418.94 → 422.54] Licensed software that has the encryption keys
[423.66 → 428.06] With that said I haven't tried to do that in a very long time
[428.62 → 430.62] Can you play back?
[430.62 → 432.62] UHD like the latest
[432.62 → 434.86] HDR 4k Blu-rays on a computer?
[436.30 → 437.74] I don't know
[438.62 → 441.66] I know that there's that complicated mess around watching
[442.54 → 447.34] 4k Netflix on a computer like you need a platform that supports
[447.98 → 454.06] Intel's you know latest HDCP nonsense and all of that, and you have to use a browser that supports it
[454.06 → 458.06] Uh, snowpack in float plane chat says yes as does loading still okay
[458.46 → 464.38] Apparently you can still do it, and you would obviously be able to do that without pairing the disc to the console
[465.34 → 469.02] But I pretty much guarantee you at some point
[469.58 → 473.66] When that software is configured you will need to do some kind of online check
[473.66 → 477.50] And I do wonder if this is something that is down to movie studio pressure
[478.38 → 483.66] That makes the whole thing make a ton more sense, but it's I mean it's no less dystopian
[484.30 → 489.74] Like you buy a product and so what someone else decides if you're allowed to use it or not like any
[489.74 → 495.74] I buy it I plug it in is all the hardware there. Well, then it should probably work and that
[495.74 → 500.06] I'm surprised this wouldn't get caught by like a right to repair thing almost
[501.18 → 507.82] Well, I mean it is that's why it's news. Oh, yeah, people are super mad about it or at least they think it's super stupid
[507.82 → 513.58] I don't know if most people are necessarily mad because here's another thing, and you know back to your point about gamers
[513.58 → 516.30] Just rolling over for this like we seem to do for everything is
[517.02 → 521.02] Who runs a PlayStation 5 without an internet connection?
[521.98 → 529.10] Yeah, like I think this will as stupid as this is I think it'll affect very few people like mall today. That's the problem
[530.14 → 532.14] frustrating wreck itself
[532.14 → 538.22] Completely when you can't download games for it anymore, which will happen, and you can't have this disk drive
[538.22 → 540.22] It'll literally just be a brick
[541.02 → 547.74] I am making a poll real quick here because I want to know if people's current gen consoles are
[547.82 → 549.50] 24 7 connected
[549.50 → 552.62] So I'm just going to set a two-minute timer on this let's run this on flow plane
[552.62 → 558.16] So guys, I want to hear from you is your PlayStation 5 or your Xbox series connected?
[558.88 → 560.56] 24 7
[560.56 → 562.56] Pull up the results
[563.80 → 570.12] Okay, are you guys that's not true there? I genuinely think that's not true. Why don't even bother pulling you guys?
[570.24 → 573.68] Yeah, I just straight up don't believe that poll. Yeah, that's
[574.68 → 578.78] Okay, for those who aren't able to see a teeny weeny ice train of vision down there
[578.78 → 585.96] Well three out of four are saying yes connected all the time and one quarter are saying no not connected
[587.44 → 588.04] I
[588.04 → 592.38] Yeah, I'm sorry. I actually just don't buy that even like more than a quarter. It's 30% right now
[592.70 → 595.60] Um, I think that might be some people being like well
[595.60 → 600.70] I turn it off, and then it's not connected to the internet or something. I don't know what we mean is like
[601.50 → 603.50] I didn't say powered. I said connected
[606.06 → 607.26] Is that connected? Yeah
[607.26 → 613.48] If it's I mean yeah, okay wireless is if it's authenticated I consider it connected
[615.70 → 619.40] Look you want to get pedantic or whatever they might be that's what I'm saying
[619.96 → 624.88] Yeah, that's not that's not very useful you guys. It's not very helpful. Yeah, I
[626.20 → 631.50] Never unplug mine from the internet. Yeah, I mean most people wouldn't like the idea of
[631.50 → 638.00] Of the vast majority of people that own a console. It's either going to be plugged in or it's gonna auto connect to Wi-Fi the second you turn it on
[638.00 → 643.72] Like the idea of your device only connecting to internet when you need to use the internet is
[644.74 → 649.76] So outdated we might as well be talking about the PlayStation 1 era at that point
[649.76 → 651.94] Right like back when we had dial-up
[651.94 → 656.70] We had to make a conscious decision to connect to the internet
[659.12 → 664.28] Like you get all the modem connecting sounds I mean ever since broadband I know I didn't do a good job
[664.28 → 667.00] It's fine. Just get over it ever since broadband
[667.94 → 671.34] Things are just connected 24 7 because they don't tie up your phone line
[671.34 → 681.10] so if your console is connected at all I'm sorry, but I simply do not believe you that you explicitly
[681.46 → 683.06] disconnect it and
[683.06 → 687.60] Then connect it when you need to use the internet. I actually do not believe you that would be
[688.16 → 694.54] Wild yeah, I saw some people in chat being like well. I don't have a console, and it's like yeah
[695.54 → 699.26] Well, that's not what I asked was only for people that do have consoles
[699.26 → 701.26] It is your PS5
[701.82 → 703.82] 24 7 connected no
[705.50 → 707.50] I don't have one oh
[707.94 → 709.94] Man you guys either way
[710.94 → 715.30] Vast vast vast I'm assuming over 90% amount of people are going to have
[716.80 → 721.78] When it is powered on, and you own one it is connected to the internet consoles
[723.00 → 728.54] Yeah, so you're right it's not a problem until it's a problem and who knows you know
[728.54 → 734.62] Maybe Sony will adopt a very different stance towards right to repair at some point in the future
[734.86 → 739.18] And they will, you know when they turn off the authentication servers for this they will
[740.62 → 749.82] They'll do nothing yeah, that's that's probably way more realistic. Yeah, that's really frustrating, and it's not the only thing like this
[749.82 → 753.20] Obviously this shouldn't be a surprise
[753.58 → 755.58] But I was still
[756.32 → 761.02] Surprised source here the sources here are Lewis Grossman and
[761.50 → 765.72] Samsung Mexico and the headline is carriers block
[766.28 → 773.36] Mexican phones, so there's some background here around a fifth of phones in Mexico get bought through the local gray market
[773.36 → 775.36] These phones are not necessarily
[775.36 → 784.48] Necessarily illegally obtained, but the sellers are not authorized and have imported devices that were originally intended for release in other markets and
[784.56 → 789.76] They tend to sell these at a price that is well below the manufacturers suggested retail price
[790.24 → 793.76] If you're wondering this kind of gray marketing
[793.76 → 798.16] So it's not the market, and it's not the know
[798.80 → 804.56] Opposite of the market. I think the term for that has changed. So I don't I don't know whatever the point is
[804.64 → 810.56] It's kind of in between the legitimate market and the illegitimate market in that it's real goods
[810.72 → 812.72] It's not necessarily
[812.72 → 819.12] Stolen or you know obtained through nefarious means a blackmail or whatever the case may be
[819.12 → 829.76] But you might be going around intended routes for things, so a perfect example of this is something like the discount game keys or Windows keys that are accessible
[830.24 → 838.08] Through certain gray markets where they will obtain them with actual money that goes to the actual developer
[839.68 → 848.64] But a lesser amount of money because it was intended to be like a subsidized lower cost version of the software for
[849.12 → 856.32] You know a developing country say for example not for someone who lives in you know the states or Mexico or Canada, or you know
[856.32 → 859.28] Whatever else it's regional pricing is
[859.52 → 861.52] Pretty common yeah, and so
[862.08 → 868.80] One of the other major incentives for gray marketing aside from regional pricing is tariffs
[869.68 → 871.68] So in those cases
[872.00 → 875.36] You could have a real product a real intel CPU
[875.36 → 878.56] You bought really from an intel distributor
[879.04 → 883.36] But bought in America and then smuggled through some you know
[884.64 → 888.48] Nefarious means or even not nefarious even just by you know
[890.08 → 894.64] Carrying them on a boat and nobody asked any questions. I don't know probably something nefarious was involved
[894.88 → 897.28] Especially if we're talking about Brazil which is where I'm going with this
[897.28 → 901.92] But they could be smuggled into Brazil where the tariffs on electronics are
[902.48 → 906.96] I think as high as like a hundred plus percent depending on the category
[907.28 → 911.28] Making you know a gaming computer for example an extreme
[912.00 → 916.40] Extreme status symbol somewhere, somewhere like uh somewhere like Brazil so
[917.12 → 921.36] There's a strong incentive to gray market these products buying them legitimately
[921.92 → 926.00] But transporting them illegitimately so that they are somewhat affordable
[928.96 → 931.84] So anywho we've got these gray market phones
[932.64 → 942.32] in July Motorola announced that phones imported through the gray market and activated in Mexico would be subject to remote disability
[942.88 → 948.96] after July 27th making the phone completely useless except for emergency calls
[948.96 → 956.40] reportedly they are planning to identify, or they are identifying these phones via their IMEI number which is a
[957.44 → 960.48] As far as I can tell as far as I know and I'm
[961.36 → 962.32] Okay
[962.32 → 965.12] I don't spend a ton of time hanging out on Russian hacker forums
[965.68 → 969.28] So you'll have to forgive me if I am not up on the latest um
[969.84 → 974.64] You know IMEI spoofing techniques, but as far as I know there it is
[974.64 → 981.60] Is pretty much hardware and there's not any kind of easy convenient accessible way to spoof an IMEI?
[981.84 → 984.16] Do you know is that true?
[985.04 → 985.44] uh
[985.44 → 986.32] I
[986.32 → 988.32] think you can
[989.04 → 991.04] But I don't think it's like
[991.52 → 995.12] Easy or accessible at all, and I don't think it's bulletproof
[995.44 → 997.28] Like you might be able to spoof it
[997.28 → 1002.48] Maybe but like the way that it appears in your software, but my understanding is its pretty low level
[1002.48 → 1006.40] I've heard of it before, but I don't know like I'm trying to look you up right now
[1006.40 → 1011.12] But I don't know how legitimate these things are float plane chat is saying it's hard, but you can be okay. Yeah
[1011.44 → 1012.40] That was my
[1012.40 → 1014.40] Understand, but it's been a long time. Yeah, uh
[1014.96 → 1018.72] Genesis describes it as doable but far beyond most people
[1018.96 → 1023.68] Yeah, like I don't think this is a thing that's going to be done widespread even at a scale like this
[1023.92 → 1028.00] Well, yes and no. I mean if one fifth of the phones in a country
[1028.00 → 1032.80] Yeah, just stopped working you don't think mobile repair shops, you know
[1032.80 → 1036.56] Those that are absolutely everywhere are going to figure out how to do this
[1036.56 → 1038.48] We're talking about how this is a gray line too
[1038.48 → 1042.80] And some people in chat are pointing this out, and I think this is true. It is illegal. I think wrong
[1042.80 → 1045.44] You can rewrite IME eyes on android devices
[1046.32 → 1048.32] Um, yeah, but is it legal?
[1049.60 → 1051.60] That I don't know
[1051.92 → 1053.60] Also, how is that wrong?
[1053.60 → 1058.96] Didn't we just say you could do yeah, we know well we might be risk. They might be behind maybe their internet connection is
[1059.52 → 1061.36] Is not very good. Yeah, but um
[1062.40 → 1066.24] Anyway, the point is it also depends on how they're handling this
[1066.56 → 1070.56] I mean, what if Motorola's approach is to have just an allow list of IME eyes
[1072.08 → 1076.08] Well, then yeah, sure you spoof it or whatever, but that's not going to help. Yeah
[1076.96 → 1081.04] You'd have to find the right one. Yeah, exactly and if and if two I am
[1081.04 → 1086.40] I'm e eyes um two identical IME eyes show up particularly on the same mobile network
[1090.40 → 1095.52] That is definitely going to cause some problems. Yeah, so it's so it's not legal so if they're is they're trying to like
[1096.16 → 1101.44] Float in the gray space that is as far as my understanding goes a clearly illegal action
[1102.56 → 1105.28] Got it. I think that would be like ooh
[1106.16 → 1109.84] We're getting into laws that I don't know, but I think that would be like changing the VIN on your car
[1109.84 → 1115.44] Right, like I don't think you can just do that like yeah, I know you can't do that. Yeah, you could visually do it
[1115.68 → 1121.92] Yes, but it's like not okay. It's definitely not okay. Yeah, so I think like changing the cereal in a firearm or something like that
[1121.92 → 1126.96] Like nothing would physically prevent you. It's doing it. It's going to be hard to do
[1127.52 → 1131.36] Convincingly yeah, probably similarly to here. Yeah, and it's illegal
[1131.36 → 1136.16] So if you're not going to see a ton of it not legal advice. We are not lawyers
[1137.20 → 1142.40] Not financial advice either burn all your money. Wait, sorry. Not really just advice at all
[1143.20 → 1147.68] This is not an advice show that is not what the a and wan stands for. Yeah. Yeah
[1148.80 → 1152.24] Nobody really knows what it's no, it doesn't matter. It's this far
[1152.80 → 1154.80] canon is that it never stood for anything
[1154.80 → 1162.32] Now get this Samsung went even further and started disabling gray market phones retroactively
[1164.48 → 1167.44] What that sucks for the people that bought them? Uh, okay
[1167.44 → 1174.80] This must be a typo because it says both companies offered affected customers a 30 discount on Motorola devices in Mexico
[1174.80 → 1179.28] But I'm sure that's just Motorola and maybe Samsung also offered some kind of discount
[1179.28 → 1187.76] Maybe uh opp and kalpa also said they would block gray market phones in Mexico, but it's unclear whether they followed through
[1189.28 → 1192.80] Interesting now one of the motivations
[1193.36 → 1202.16] That you know my imagination could conjure up for something like this might be that this was due to government pressure because otherwise
[1202.96 → 1204.48] Why Mexico?
[1204.48 → 1206.00] Why all these manufacturers?
[1206.72 → 1214.16] Why now like maybe this is one of those things where okay organized crime is involved in the the the
[1214.48 → 1222.16] Acquisition and resale and yeah, and you know any money spent on these gray market phones is going straight into the cartels or whatever the case may be but
[1223.44 → 1225.44] Actually, the Mexican government
[1226.40 → 1228.40] Has ordered manufacturers to stop
[1229.04 → 1234.80] Disabling regular phones and called for the creation of a working group to address the gray market problem
[1234.96 → 1243.44] Without violating consumers rights because the thing here is that the only people who are being harmed by the manufacturers actions
[1244.00 → 1246.40] Are the buyers of these devices?
[1247.28 → 1249.28] Not the people who profited from it
[1250.08 → 1255.68] And if you expect the average consumer to understand that the phone that they're buying
[1255.92 → 1258.32] Which looks exactly the same as the other phone?
[1258.32 → 1266.32] Just like it other than it has a slightly more different serial number that is not authorized for use in this country
[1266.88 → 1271.20] If you expect them to understand or even care that that's wrong
[1272.40 → 1274.88] Compared to saving a hundred bucks or whatever it is
[1275.84 → 1278.00] I just I think it's kind of ridiculous
[1278.00 → 1281.44] I think it's I think basically all you're doing is making yourself look bad
[1281.44 → 1285.28] And you are not harming the sellers. I mean in the long term though
[1286.40 → 1288.40] One of the next lines
[1289.04 → 1294.00] Because I was just reading one of the sources here is like Samsung Mexico. I was just reading this, and I was like this doesn't line up
[1294.00 → 1299.76] With what we're saying at all, but one of the next lines. Yes, the Mexican government has ordered manufacturers to stop disabling
[1300.40 → 1302.96] Irregular phone. I said that you weren't listening. Okay
[1302.96 → 1307.68] Neat I was probably reading it anyway, I'm getting ahead of
[1308.64 → 1310.64] moving ahead again, so
[1311.60 → 1318.88] So the in the long term I could see this hurting the resellers once people kind of figure out that these phones might not work
[1319.60 → 1321.60] But unless they're disabling them
[1322.32 → 1324.64] Immediately I could still see them, you know
[1325.44 → 1327.44] selling these devices
[1327.52 → 1332.72] Not you know connected to a mobile network just kind of going like okay. Yeah, look it's its working
[1332.72 → 1335.20] Take it home and go taking people's money like I
[1336.16 → 1339.20] You're I think you're just going to end up with regular consumers being scammed
[1339.92 → 1346.88] Now Samsung claims they will no longer block these phones, and they are willing to work with the government on a solution
[1347.20 → 1353.12] Leaving us to our discussion question here, which is what's the right way for companies to deal with gray market devices?
[1353.36 → 1355.12] I don't know if I would say no longer
[1355.92 → 1358.16] They said they're going to suspend blocking them
[1359.12 → 1361.20] Hilarious so they're they're they're pausing
[1361.20 → 1364.16] They're they're pausing and allowing
[1364.96 → 1369.20] Some work to happen with the Mexican government to see if they can come to some form of agreement
[1369.20 → 1371.76] And it sounds like if they don't they'll probably continue
[1371.76 → 1375.28] But they didn't say that part because they probably didn't want to like to put a thread out there
[1375.28 → 1377.12] But the word suspends to me
[1377.92 → 1383.76] Sounds like there's a resume on the other end of it. So yeah, I'm not sure, so what should they do about gray market devices?
[1383.76 → 1385.76] I
[1385.76 → 1387.20] Have an idea
[1387.20 → 1389.76] How about nothing? How about off?
[1390.64 → 1396.88] How about if you can afford to sell it at that price in you know wherever a stand then you just sell it at that price?
[1396.88 → 1398.88] There's an idea
[1399.76 → 1401.76] There's an idea
[1402.48 → 1405.12] You're welcome nice like I I I don't know
[1405.12 → 1407.52] I it this just it just reminds me of like
[1408.08 → 1413.04] Yeah, it's a very consoles and games and like you know
[1413.04 → 1417.36] Obviously that in the early days the region locking wasn't very sophisticated
[1417.36 → 1423.44] It's you know a plastic notch that you can just sand down or whatever the case may be but I
[1424.96 → 1426.96] Guess
[1427.52 → 1433.44] Now that we've reached the point where the mechanisms for enforcement are so sophisticated
[1434.40 → 1438.08] We've reached the point where we kind of have to say hey actually no
[1438.80 → 1440.80] That's not okay
[1440.80 → 1444.72] You can't be you can't be bricking manufactured goods just because
[1445.68 → 1451.20] It went from one country to another country in a way you didn't like I'm sorry, but I just don't really um
[1451.92 → 1453.52] Yeah, I don't like really I
[1453.92 → 1457.84] I think I could potentially support them wanting to do something about it
[1458.56 → 1467.12] um, but bricking the phones is really aggressive towards people that just want your phone not the resellers doing the actual bad stuff
[1467.68 → 1468.48] um
[1468.48 → 1473.92] Because like I can understand like they might not be making money in some of these markets like at all
[1474.56 → 1480.16] And those markets might be supported through the sales and other markets like we don't necessarily know how their business is being handled
[1480.72 → 1482.72] um
[1482.72 → 1484.88] But yeah, breaking all the phones is not cool
[1486.00 → 1489.44] I mean that you know raises another interesting question like should
[1490.24 → 1491.36] Should we then okay?
[1491.68 → 1499.84] should I be supportive of them selling devices at cost into a developing market knowing that I'm helping subsidize that
[1499.84 → 1503.28] You don't have to be supportive of it
[1503.84 → 1507.52] So then if I'm not supportive of it then I guess I would take my stance which is
[1508.00 → 1513.36] Sell the device for whatever you know your cost is plus some margin that you presumably need to make
[1513.36 → 1516.40] And then off and don't tell me where I can or can't use it
[1517.20 → 1517.60] fair enough
[1519.60 → 1522.88] Either way, I don't support them bricking the phones. I think that's a
[1524.08 → 1527.36] And I don't really I don't really see an alternative
[1529.28 → 1535.04] What is the alternative because anything we actually pay more that's because of your yeah, that's because of your government tax
[1535.12 → 1542.16] Yeah, that's not the company. Yeah. Yeah, that's so to be clear. We are not talking about
[1542.16 → 1543.76] um
[1543.76 → 1550.88] situations where the increase in cost to the consumer the increase in price to the consumer is because of
[1551.68 → 1553.52] import tariffs or taxes
[1554.24 → 1561.76] That's on the government, and you know, that's that's always going to that's always going to be something that smugglers are going to try to get around
[1562.08 → 1564.80] And that's always going to be a certain kind of gray market
[1565.20 → 1568.08] We're talking about situations where the manufacturer
[1568.08 → 1578.16] Has their own set regional pricing that they are trying to prevent people from working around it's super working devices super visible in video games
[1578.56 → 1582.88] Yeah, it's a big thing for a while people would like to sell accounts
[1584.48 → 1589.68] Like free accounts that were authenticated in countries where they would get the games cheaper
[1590.80 → 1594.48] Because you'd pay money for the account, but then all the games that you'd buy after that would be cheaper
[1594.48 → 1596.48] Like there was all this like crazy stuff going on
[1597.20 → 1597.92] um
[1597.92 → 1602.40] There's yeah, it's its weird. I remember hearing I don't remember what game it was
[1602.40 → 1604.64] But it was some online game that required a subscription
[1605.76 → 1609.60] And you could go into the online dashboard and update your address
[1610.16 → 1611.84] to one of the countries that had
[1612.40 → 1614.40] A lower subscription rate
[1614.88 → 1619.52] uh subscribe with uh like an American or whatever else credit card
[1619.52 → 1625.76] Yep, and everything just you switch your address to there subscribe you buy like however many months at a time
[1626.24 → 1628.00] And then you just change your address back
[1628.56 → 1632.24] And everything's fine like they didn't have any authentication at all
[1632.24 → 1635.60] I've had a couple of people just that whose comments I've seen
[1635.60 → 1638.24] I don't even remember emails forum posts. I don't know
[1638.72 → 1642.64] But have brought up that they subscribe to YouTube premium in a different region
[1642.64 → 1644.72] And it costs like two dollars a month or something like that
[1644.72 → 1650.96] And you'd think a company with the technical resources of Google would be able to detect something like that pretty easily
[1651.36 → 1653.20] Especially because I know
[1653.76 → 1658.40] That when someone doesn't want you to buy something from a different region
[1658.64 → 1663.84] They can stop you like do you have any idea how hard it was to buy a valve index?
[1664.72 → 1667.36] Yeah, I remember this valve was serious business
[1667.68 → 1670.40] You are not buying an index if you are not in
[1670.40 → 1675.12] You know America or wherever the other regions that they launched it and were, and it's like well
[1675.12 → 1679.52] I'm not going to take no for an answer. I need an index. I have to review the thing
[1680.08 → 1683.84] So I will obtain one but the only way I was able to do it
[1684.56 → 1687.76] I tried shipping to an American address with a Canadian card
[1688.32 → 1691.92] I tried shipping to a Canadian address with an USD card
[1692.32 → 1695.84] I tried shipping to an American address
[1695.84 → 1702.80] I was paying in us dollars and shipping to a US address
[1703.60 → 1704.96] Why do they care?
[1706.72 → 1711.76] And it wouldn't go through, and ultimately you know how we did it
[1711.76 → 1712.64] I've got around a few of these but no
[1712.64 → 1714.64] All right, we had john
[1714.64 → 1716.48] We had our writer who lives in car-
[1716.48 → 1718.48] I was going to say in Carolina
[1718.48 → 1720.56] But I'm sure it and I'm sure that that would be very offensive
[1720.56 → 1721.52] Yeah
[1721.52 → 1728.72] Well, yeah, well, I didn't want to get super specific, but that's fine
[1728.72 → 1730.48] It's a state North Carolina lives in North Carolina
[1731.04 → 1733.84] I know there are two Carolina just chill
[1735.44 → 1739.36] Relax yeah north and east yeah, it's just like east Arkansas and west Arkansas
[1743.84 → 1746.72] Does he know American geography or does he not?
[1746.72 → 1749.68] You'll never know it's a stalemate
[1751.36 → 1752.64] So in a chat I hate it
[1755.84 → 1758.88] Yeah, don't forget about don't forget about red Texas and blue Texas
[1762.00 → 1763.60] There's Austin and Dallas and the rest
[1766.24 → 1769.76] That's okay, I know the Alaska thing wait which hand is it this one
[1769.76 → 1772.48] It's like the state of Alaska
[1773.60 → 1776.88] Is the shape of the back of your hand when you do this with your fingers?
[1776.88 → 1778.16] Oh, okay
[1778.88 → 1780.16] But I don't remember which hand it is
[1780.72 → 1782.08] Well, it's hold on. Can I see?
[1784.64 → 1786.72] That yeah, yeah, it's that one there you go
[1787.12 → 1790.88] I just know the shape of Alaska that's not because I like remember which one it is
[1790.88 → 1793.44] Why do you not know the shape of Alaska? It's attached to Canada
[1793.44 → 1796.80] Well, it has two thingies and I just didn't remember which one was longer
[1796.80 → 1800.08] Oh, okay, yeah cool
[1801.60 → 1803.60] Anywho
[1804.24 → 1805.68] As a Texan this is correct
[1808.64 → 1810.48] Anyway, uh what are we talking about?
[1811.36 → 1814.64] Right how to deal with this? I don't think there's a good way to deal with this
[1814.64 → 1818.00] I just don't think there's any way around it. I think the answer is give up
[1818.00 → 1822.72] Just don't break phones. Yeah, stop it breaking phones sucks for everyone to stop you're making e-waste and
[1822.72 → 1823.52] and
[1823.52 → 1827.04] Bothering your customers who yeah, who did buy your product?
[1827.04 → 1834.16] Yeah, you actually did sell that product, and you make money if you didn't make enough money. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry
[1834.96 → 1837.12] I set a higher price next time. I don't care
[1838.56 → 1840.56] Deal with it
[1840.56 → 1842.56] All right, what are we doing next Dan?
[1842.56 → 1848.16] Oh, well, you guys still got 15 minutes left before we have to talk about merch messages, but we could just talk about merch messages
[1848.16 → 1854.00] Yes, let's talk about merch messages that can be next I can't do it until you move the sign okay
[1854.64 → 1858.16] It's impossible. It's actually not allowed. It's illegal for freeing us
[1858.40 → 1860.80] Otherwise, they'd be gray market merch messages
[1861.52 → 1867.28] Somebody get a three over here. I think all merch messages are gray market authentic merch messages that were imported
[1868.40 → 1871.60] Illegally, these are handmade artisanal signs. Oh
[1872.40 → 1874.40] They are not they're printed. Oh
[1874.96 → 1877.20] Well, my side is no, I'm proving it. I uh
[1879.04 → 1882.32] That's right. I forgot. Furthermore, I was at me. Hi, Luke. Hey
[1883.20 → 1887.52] What are we using this for? Bye? Oh, wait, no complicated
[1889.04 → 1891.52] You're revealing the wall that no one's supposed to be able to see
[1896.56 → 1897.68] Yeah, but this side
[1897.68 → 1899.68] I
[1901.04 → 1905.44] I still love how the most interesting wall no one ever sees and then like
[1906.00 → 1911.52] Probably the most boring one is one people see all the time. It's still amazing to me
[1912.24 → 1916.16] You're not wrong. I forgot that you guys also looked at them. Yeah
[1918.24 → 1920.88] All right, hit me Dan. Uh, you have to tell me what they are
[1921.52 → 1926.40] Merch message. Oh, right. Explain. Merch messages are the way to interact with the show
[1926.40 → 1930.88] Yeah, don't send super chats. Don't send twitch bits send merch messages
[1930.88 → 1937.92] It's great because not only do you get to throw money at your screen so that strangers on the internet can you know
[1938.88 → 1945.36] Build a wall that nobody ever looks at people are saying super chats and twitch bits are gray market merch messages
[1945.36 → 1950.00] I mean, it's more the other way around yeah, I kind of is
[1951.76 → 1953.76] But legitimate
[1953.76 → 1960.24] Yes, yes, yes, so what's better about them is that you can throw money at the screen and help out your favourite creator
[1961.68 → 1963.68] Us yeah
[1963.68 → 1965.68] Yeah, and get your order in the mail
[1965.68 → 1967.60] Yeah, so to send a merch message all you got to do is go on
[1967.76 → 1969.76] Lttstore.com pick up something awesome
[1970.24 → 1975.76] We actually have a bunch of perfect deals going on right now some new products
[1975.76 → 1978.72] A pretty crazy promo on our plaid flannels
[1978.96 → 1985.20] So you just got to pick something up and in the cart you will see a box to leave a merch message, and it'll show up down there or
[1985.52 → 1988.00] producer Dan might respond to you or
[1988.00 → 1995.36] uh forward it to someone else internally to get back to you or even curate it so that Luke and I can address your question on the show
[1995.60 → 1997.60] So Dan why don't you show us how that works?
[1997.92 → 2004.08] Sure, I got one here with AMD releasing the thread ripper 7000 series for DIY users
[2004.16 → 2008.00] Do you think AMD will continue releasing processors for DIY users?
[2008.32 → 2012.48] Or do you think it will flip right back to OEM only despite intel?
[2012.64 → 2016.56] Okay, this question requires a little bit of background
[2016.56 → 2024.16] Um Luke how up on the thread ripper shenanigans that AMD has pulled are you they did it everyone was stoked on it
[2024.16 → 2026.40] They weren't going to do it anymore, and then they did it again
[2027.28 → 2034.72] Okay, that's a very, very succinct summary, but not a very accurate one. Okay, so why don't we improve on that a little bit?
[2035.12 → 2037.12] I'll give you guys a bit more background
[2037.60 → 2043.68] Thread ripper launched alongside, or I think shortly after the original dozen 1000
[2043.68 → 2050.96] It was the same dozen chaplets, but many more of them and I believe the first generation went up to
[2051.68 → 2053.68] I want to say
[2053.68 → 2055.68] 16 cores or was it 32?
[2056.32 → 2058.32] uh, whatever the thread ripper
[2059.36 → 2060.48] 1950
[2060.48 → 2065.12] X was let's have a quick look boo no information available for this page
[2065.84 → 2067.28] um
[2067.28 → 2073.68] I oh man now I'm not going to get it right. I jinxed it nice and succinct Linus. I jinxed it
[2073.68 → 2075.28] I think it's succinct or accurate
[2076.00 → 2079.84] Okay, I think the 1950 was uh 16. Okay
[2080.56 → 2084.48] What's there was there a 1970 though? This is like gray market
[2084.96 → 2089.04] uh, okay thread ripper information. Can you gray market tech tips?
[2089.04 → 2091.04] Can you
[2091.04 → 2099.28] Thread ripper was a CPU? No, I was accurate. I was accurate the first family went up to 16 cores and it the 1950x
[2099.28 → 2099.52] Okay
[2100.48 → 2104.00] What was cool about thread ripper was that compared to
[2104.56 → 2106.72] consumer platforms it had
[2107.76 → 2112.40] Mono memory bandwidth and a ton of PCIE connectivity
[2112.40 → 2116.96] Compared to server platforms or traditional workstation platforms
[2117.20 → 2123.12] It didn't support nearly the same amount of system memory which was considered kind of a Achilles heel
[2123.44 → 2131.12] Because you had all these cores 16 cores in the 1000 series up to 32 cores in the 2000 series
[2131.52 → 2137.76] Which ballooned to up to 64 cores in the 3000 series which is flip and wild
[2137.76 → 2144.64] But the 3000 series if I recall correctly was limited to I want to say 256 megabytes of system memory
[2144.88 → 2149.36] So you had all this bandwidth you had all this PCIE connectivity you had all this computes
[2149.68 → 2152.00] But you couldn't attach that much ram to it
[2152.00 → 2155.20] Which was AMD's way of ensuring that they would have a way to
[2155.84 → 2161.84] Differentiate their workstation and their server products from their enthusiast thread ripper products now
[2162.64 → 2164.64] as we made our way from
[2164.64 → 2170.56] 1000 series thread ripper to 2000 series thread ripper to 3000 series thread ripper some stuff happened
[2170.88 → 2175.52] That was a little bit different from how AMD handled the consumer side of things
[2176.00 → 2180.48] The first two thread rippers were on socket LGA
[2181.52 → 2183.52] Balls I can't remember hold on
[2186.40 → 2190.32] Yeah, okay this like summary article that I'm looking at it. Oh, yeah, there we go
[2190.32 → 2196.72] um socket t str4 and while on the consumer side of things we got
[2197.28 → 2203.28] Ry zen 1000 2000 3000 all on the am4 platform in fact all the way up to dozen 5000
[2204.16 → 2213.12] stayed on the am4 socket for thread ripper that actually changed when they went to zen 2 with thread ripper 3000, and we got socket
[2213.52 → 2215.12] trx4
[2216.00 → 2223.12] Now the problem with that is that AMD committed at that time hey, we're sorry for changing away from socket s
[2223.92 → 2227.44] socket tr4 and moving over to trx4
[2228.40 → 2234.16] Our bad we know we want to have better socket continuity than intel and all we managed to do was
[2234.72 → 2236.72] zen and zen plus on this one
[2236.72 → 2242.00] We're going to do better next time, and then they promptly did not do better at all
[2243.04 → 2249.04] Not only did we not get any new CPUs for that
[2250.16 → 2252.72] Socket so not only did they change sockets on us
[2253.28 → 2260.40] But we never got a single CPU upgrade for that platform thread ripper 3000 never got a follow-up and
[2260.96 → 2267.12] From my understanding based on leaks based on rumours that I have personally participated in
[2267.68 → 2269.20] It's not because they weren't done
[2270.08 → 2275.20] They were basically done the product so updated zen 3 chips for
[2276.08 → 2278.24] uh strx4 and they just
[2279.28 → 2285.20] Didn't release them because it wasn't nearly as profitable as releasing workstation or server chips
[2285.20 → 2293.20] Under the thread ripper pro branding which would come later actually two and a half years later on socket
[2294.40 → 2296.32] w for workstation
[2296.88 → 2298.32] wrx8
[2300.88 → 2308.24] So what we got was thread ripper 1000 on str4 thread ripper 2000 on str4
[2308.56 → 2314.08] thread ripper 3000 along with a big boatload of broken promises on strx4
[2314.08 → 2320.40] And then we got thread ripper 5000 pro only on that workstation platform
[2320.72 → 2326.88] And they just never bothered with thread ripper 5000 non-pro which was a giant
[2327.36 → 2331.84] Boogie in the face of everyone who invested in strx4
[2332.40 → 2335.76] Like me to the tune of like a dozen workstations
[2336.40 → 2340.32] Expecting to have upgrades available for it which never arrived
[2340.32 → 2344.96] Because for video editing we do need a fair amount of system memory
[2344.96 → 2349.12] Yeah, but we don't need more than I forget if it was 256 I think it was
[2350.00 → 2354.32] 256 gigs of ram that's actually lots for us, we're not doing simulation work or
[2355.68 → 2356.64] AI
[2356.64 → 2357.12] uh
[2357.12 → 2361.28] or AI work, or you know anything like that it's its plenty for video editing
[2361.28 → 2365.12] We just want the performance, and we want the PCIE connectivity so we can plug in
[2365.12 → 2369.84] A lot of extra devices like high speed, you know fibre optic network cards and stuff like that
[2370.48 → 2370.80] um
[2372.48 → 2374.72] So what was the question again?
[2375.92 → 2376.08] right
[2378.16 → 2383.44] I'm still not certain if what I said was actually incorrect. I think it was just way too short. Yeah
[2384.72 → 2389.84] So I didn't realize we're doing like a whole history coming back to anonymous's question here with AMD
[2389.84 → 2395.44] releasing thread ripper 7000 for DIY users not just for you know workstation integrators
[2395.84 → 2402.48] Do you think AMD will continue releasing these processors for DIY or do you think it'll flip right back to system integrators only?
[2402.48 → 2402.80] Oh, yeah
[2402.80 → 2408.08] There was a short period of thread ripper pro where it was system integrators only you couldn't even buy them more broadly
[2408.08 → 2411.76] But 5 000 you could buy assuming you could afford them because they went up to like
[2412.32 → 2416.16] $8,000 when the previous ones were not that expensive because they were meant for consumers
[2416.16 → 2420.24] Um, the answer is I don't know yeah, because they're lying
[2423.28 → 2429.36] The fact that AMD gets a free pass from enthusiasts for you know being an underdog or whatever is it's baffling to me
[2429.36 → 2431.36] They're also a company. They're also
[2432.00 → 2439.28] Interested in one thing just like an intel or just like an NVIDIA. I think they're I think they're I shouldn't say just like an NVIDIA
[2439.28 → 2442.88] NVIDIA's got their own sort of they have a particularly brazen
[2442.88 → 2448.88] um manner of pursuing actively and openly like dislike a large section of their
[2449.52 → 2451.52] consumer base
[2451.92 → 2456.48] Okay, so this is one of those things that's complicated every time we kind of get into this it's like, okay
[2458.24 → 2461.92] Corporately, I agree with you. Yeah, but I've met so many passionate
[2462.48 → 2466.72] Not individually. No, and I have as well for sure. I know some people in video that are great people
[2466.72 → 2470.48] But just like the corporate actions the business actions are
[2471.60 → 2475.92] Yeah, so I just we just need to not we just need to not believe them
[2475.92 → 2480.72] I mean we can, you know when we do a video about it if AMD says you know, yeah
[2480.72 → 2482.72] We're going to support this socket for
[2482.96 → 2486.32] Several generations, and we're going to do this. We're going to do that, you know, well we'll tell you hey
[2486.32 → 2490.88] They say that, but we're also not going to ignore those broken promises from the past
[2490.88 → 2494.72] And I think AMD has shown that they are capable of
[2495.28 → 2503.76] Doing short-run processors like those cool x3d chips that they dumped a while ago at micro centre and somewhere else
[2503.76 → 2505.92] I forget who had them in stock like
[2506.56 → 2512.64] It is conceivable that they could offer an upgrade to thread or profile thread ripper 3000 users still
[2513.36 → 2515.36] but they
[2515.36 → 2517.36] They won't
[2517.36 → 2519.36] They don't wish to
[2519.60 → 2523.92] And I don't know I'm just I'm I'm very frustrated the good news is that
[2525.04 → 2532.64] These days I do also kind of get it now that we have consumer chips that are anywhere from 16 to 24 cores
[2532.64 → 2535.28] Depending on whether you're on the intel or AMD side of things
[2536.40 → 2541.04] I think the necessity of a high-end desktop platform is less
[2541.52 → 2548.24] But I am also glad to see them make a return even if I don't have a lot of trust that they will continue to support it
[2549.04 → 2551.04] There that is my answer
[2551.68 → 2553.68] Amazing
[2554.56 → 2563.44] LLD do you see a time when storage servers will just be filled with hundreds or thousands of m.2 drives providing petabytes of ultra-fast storage
[2563.68 → 2565.68] In a one or two you rack
[2565.68 → 2572.24] Already exists in some cases doesn't it I'm on it okay
[2577.12 → 2577.60] There you go
[2577.60 → 2586.64] There it is so these are super cool these are like these tiny little slim cute SSDs
[2587.20 → 2591.68] um that you would equip a server with you know any anywhere from
[2592.40 → 2593.36] typically
[2593.36 → 2597.76] A handful to dozens of SSDs
[2598.40 → 2600.40] Right now the challenge is
[2601.12 → 2603.12] fitting enough compute
[2603.12 → 2607.76] In that same form factor that you can actually make full use of these things
[2607.76 → 2612.00] But I do wonder if you are is you are right
[2612.48 → 2617.44] That we may see a future where we don't worry so much about having enough compute
[2617.84 → 2620.56] And we just accept that the performance is going to be
[2621.76 → 2623.20] kind of crap
[2623.20 → 2627.76] And we just pack a ton of these in because up until now NVMe
[2628.48 → 2631.28] SSDs for the data centre have been
[2632.72 → 2635.36] You've got these branches where they are focused on performance
[2635.68 → 2637.44] Or they're focused on capacity
[2637.52 → 2642.48] But even the ones that are capacity oriented are still you know pretty darn good performance
[2642.48 → 2649.28] But I think as we make our way into storing more and more and more bits per cell we could end up with some
[2650.16 → 2652.16] extremely cheap
[2652.64 → 2659.92] Per gigabyte Nan flash, and we could end up with servers that like you suggest might allocate as few as you know
[2660.56 → 2669.36] A single PCIE lane per multiple SSDs and just cram them in an effort to go for capacity
[2669.36 → 2672.64] Hopefully you're not accessing all those particular ones at the same time
[2673.20 → 2677.04] Yeah, and you almost never would yeah, right like it's not completely against it
[2677.04 → 2681.60] Especially for certain use cases if you know what you're getting into like someday for bulk storage
[2681.60 → 2684.40] Yeah, I could see it being somewhat realistic
[2684.40 → 2692.24] But I also do wonder if you know by the time you're architecting such a specialized device if you would be better off just
[2693.12 → 2695.12] architecting a SSD
[2695.12 → 2699.44] That just stacks way more NAND packages on it
[2699.44 → 2706.96] And then you don't need all that PCIE because PCIE is going to be one of the biggest cost drivers of that entire solution
[2706.96 → 2709.20] Especially if you have to do any PCIE switching
[2709.60 → 2714.88] So if you're like I had suggested taking a single PCIE lane off of you know
[2714.88 → 2720.64] Let's say an AMD epic platform so dual CPU you would have 160 lanes so you could do up to 160
[2720.64 → 2724.00] You know theoretically if you had absolutely nothing else right like no
[2724.56 → 2730.40] Network card, which is not realistic, but let's just bear with me here. Okay, so you could do up to 160
[2730.96 → 2733.68] SSDs off that thing if they were one lane each well
[2734.16 → 2739.68] You could quadruple that if you you know put a PCIE by one
[2740.64 → 2743.92] Switch on it and put you know four SSDs behind it
[2744.64 → 2748.24] Like you said you wouldn't get full bandwidth from all four SSDs at a time
[2748.24 → 2754.16] But you'd be so parallelized at that point that I just have a hard time imagining that that would be a problem unless you are
[2754.80 → 2757.68] Divvying up the resources of that system
[2758.48 → 2765.84] Hardware by hardware to cloud customers or something like that where yeah conceivably two customers on the same PCIE switch
[2766.32 → 2767.84] Could be hitting their SSD at the same time
[2767.84 → 2771.84] But if you pooled all the storage and then just allocated it in chunks
[2774.00 → 2778.80] I think it's very unlikely to be a problem with that amount of overall bandwidth available
[2778.80 → 2783.44] We're talking 160 lanes of gen 5 on the latest epic platforms. It's its
[2784.56 → 2786.64] every once in a while bandwidth, but like
[2788.96 → 2791.36] I suspect if the use case is right
[2791.36 → 2796.56] I suspect you could get it to a point where the amount of issues that you have are so infrequent that they're not that big
[2796.56 → 2803.44] Yeah, I could definitely see that and so you know that's that's one possibility, but those PCIE switches would be
[2804.16 → 2805.36] costly
[2805.36 → 2807.36] Whereas I think that
[2807.60 → 2814.24] If you were is they would be costly per unit whereas if you were to develop a new SSD that just loads
[2814.80 → 2819.68] You know terabytes upon terabytes of of Nan flash like we uh
[2820.24 → 2825.12] We covered that 100 that 100 terabyte SSD a while back on the channel
[2825.12 → 2830.72] Clearly it's been done. Well that engineering gets done once and then every unit is just
[2831.28 → 2834.56] Cost of NAND chips. You don't have to put a bunch of PCIE switching them
[2834.56 → 2837.12] I think that SSD might have actually used some switching internally
[2838.00 → 2840.64] The point is I think there 's's going to be solutions
[2841.36 → 2844.64] For stuff like this in the future, but hard drives are
[2845.12 → 2846.72] Still a more
[2847.36 → 2850.72] Cost effective way to do bulk storage. I think they're going to be for a while
[2850.72 → 2858.48] And the only way that you would use something like you're suggesting would be for bulk storage you see their shipping Seagate announced
[2859.44 → 2860.56] 28
[2860.56 → 2862.56] terabyte drives
[2863.04 → 2864.24] um
[2864.24 → 2867.20] WWF also has 28 terabyte drives now
[2867.68 → 2870.32] I'm just trying to imagine a scenario
[2870.32 → 2876.56] That's actually insane where I would want 28 terabytes of data at the mercy of a hard drive man
[2876.56 → 2878.56] So the iron wolf pros
[2879.28 → 2880.88] I think
[2880.88 → 2882.88] five years ago
[2882.88 → 2887.68] Were 10 terabyte drives and iron wolf pros are now 22 terabyte drives
[2888.40 → 2890.40] That's crazy
[2894.72 → 2896.72] Wow
[2897.44 → 2898.32] Sheesh man
[2899.20 → 2901.28] Yeah, I just I I I um
[2901.28 → 2906.32] Um, every time I there was a while there where hard drives were kind of
[2907.52 → 2912.72] Still could be worth a premium for the top capacities and still had some sex appeal
[2912.72 → 2916.08] Even though your boot drive was probably a SSD if you were an enthusiast
[2916.48 → 2922.16] But now it has become so easy for me to completely ignore hard drives for
[2923.36 → 2925.44] I still like a year at a time
[2926.00 → 2932.00] And, so I'll turn I'll turn, so I'll turn away, and I'll turn back, and I'll go what this there's 28 terabyte hard drives now
[2932.16 → 2933.52] Yeah, and like
[2933.52 → 2935.52] Okay, like what's the what's the pricing of?
[2935.68 → 2938.08] Okay here. What's the pricing of a 22?
[2938.64 → 2942.40] Terabyte hard drive like that's that's 420 nice. Um
[2944.72 → 2947.12] I just want to say one really quick one side
[2947.84 → 2952.00] Um, this is a very off-topic, but I just saw the art for this
[2952.88 → 2957.28] Hard drives are getting like the old school GPU treatment like that looks sick
[2958.32 → 2960.80] It's like unnecessarily cool for a hard drive
[2961.28 → 2967.44] You know my understanding is um, the person who was responsible for WD's green black
[2967.84 → 2968.80] They're doing this now?
[2968.80 → 2972.08] Uh, because that was perfect branding moved over to Seagate
[2972.72 → 2974.24] Wouldn't be surprised if it's the same person
[2974.24 → 2978.40] So believe it or not uh Seagate has colour-coded drives now, I think
[2978.40 → 2980.40] Um
[2981.52 → 2983.28] Oh, maybe they're not colour-coded
[2983.92 → 2986.08] Either yeah, no, I'm not sure if they're colour-coded
[2986.08 → 2991.76] I don't think they're colour-coded in the same way that the WD ones are, but the iron wolves are red and this Eros thing is green
[2991.76 → 2995.60] I think there's some amount of like grouping logic behind it, which I think it's fine
[2996.16 → 2998.48] Um, but yeah, I don't know that just goes
[2999.44 → 3000.96] unbelievably hard for
[3002.56 → 3006.16] Um, oh, yeah, they're definitely colour-coded it's blue for surveillance
[3006.80 → 3008.16] Red for NAS
[3008.96 → 3015.36] Um, green for Eros for enterprise and then ugly for everyone else, I guess
[3017.44 → 3020.16] All right, you can update that one maybe come on
[3020.16 → 3020.32] Sick
[3021.60 → 3022.88] Make that a little cooler
[3023.84 → 3025.60] Man, it's amazing how hard it is
[3025.60 → 3029.92] I think the iron wolf brand is so sick to find anything on new egg that is just
[3031.28 → 3032.08] a product
[3032.08 → 3037.52] What's the surveillance one? What is the name of the Eros iron wolf, and then what's the surveillance one?
[3038.24 → 3038.96] Sky hawk
[3038.96 → 3039.52] Oh
[3040.64 → 3041.60] So sick!
[3041.60 → 3043.76] Oh, no, sky hawk AI
[3044.40 → 3044.72] Whoa
[3045.44 → 3046.48] They're AI drives
[3046.48 → 3047.28] That's worse
[3050.16 → 3050.80] Skynet
[3051.28 → 3051.68] Um
[3052.40 → 3053.20] Yeah, I don't know
[3053.20 → 3059.04] I just I don't understand how like hard drive branding is going way harder than GPUs these days like that's crazy
[3059.52 → 3060.96] I don't know. It's kind of sick
[3062.08 → 3068.80] I just how far GPUs have fallen the GPU art both on the box and the card used to be so cool
[3070.00 → 3074.40] And now it's just like metal and fan. Well, that's because of NVIDIA. Yep
[3075.20 → 3081.52] It's actually because of NVIDIA. NVIDIA maintains very tight control over the packaging and branding of their partners
[3081.52 → 3083.52] And it's so boring
[3085.84 → 3086.48] Next topic
[3087.04 → 3088.00] Speaking of boring
[3089.12 → 3090.24] Why don't you pick a topic?
[3091.60 → 3093.36] I'm going to do it. IRS pilots
[3093.36 → 3093.68] Oh
[3096.48 → 3097.68] Okay, I did actually
[3097.68 → 3098.80] You walked me into that one
[3098.80 → 3099.44] I know
[3099.44 → 3100.64] This is great though
[3101.20 → 3104.56] It I if you're not excited about this, maybe you haven't paid taxes yet
[3104.56 → 3112.32] Uh, in 2024 an IRS pilot program will allow residents of 13 states to electronically file their tax returns for free
[3112.64 → 3114.24] Directly with the IRS
[3114.24 → 3120.64] This goes against the wishes of tax preparation companies who have been lobbying against free direct filing for over a decade
[3120.88 → 3123.92] Arguing that free alternatives are already available, which is
[3124.88 → 3125.84] Technically true
[3126.40 → 3128.40] In the most BS way ever
[3128.40 → 3136.72] Those free alternatives arose out of the free file alliance a 2001 partnership between the IRS and several tax preparation companies
[3136.96 → 3143.28] To offer taxpayers with simple returns a free alternative for filing their taxes a later investigation by
[3144.00 → 3151.52] ProPublica found that several companies made those options purposefully difficult to find in order to trick their customers into paying for services
[3151.52 → 3154.96] They could have received for free. Um, this has been somewhat recently
[3154.96 → 3156.96] uh called dark patterns
[3157.92 → 3159.92] By a bunch of people including us
[3159.92 → 3164.32] Um, they're just they're called dark patterns. Yeah, I think that's a newer term though
[3164.80 → 3170.00] Is it I don't think it's that new it's not like this year new that's for sure. I've only heard it within the last few years
[3171.28 → 3175.52] I might just be late to the party. I think you're late to the party. It's very possible
[3177.44 → 3179.44] Anyway
[3180.08 → 3184.64] User experience designer Henry Bristol coined the neologism
[3184.96 → 3190.64] Neologism. I don't I'm not, not familiar with that word on 28th of July 2010
[3191.44 → 3194.64] So we've been calling them dark patterns for over 10 years
[3195.20 → 3203.84] Okay, I definitely didn't hear about it in 2010. This is fun in 2021 the electronic frontier foundation and consumer reports created a tip line
[3204.08 → 3210.16] To collect information about dark patterns from the public. That's cool disclosure. I am plagiarizing this from Wikipedia cool
[3210.16 → 3212.16] Oh
[3213.12 → 3216.00] Oh my gosh, okay, this is amazing
[3216.00 → 3223.68] There are classifications of patterns one of them is called privacy puckering
[3223.68 → 3225.68] Oh
[3233.68 → 3241.04] Whoa is that like that's that wait hold on that's like a government recognized term. I don't know why don't you guess what it is?
[3241.04 → 3247.12] You know what? Let's play a game. I'm going to read different kinds of dark patterns, and you're going to tell me what you think they are okay?
[3247.12 → 3252.08] Are we starting with privacy puckering? Oh, we're definitely starting with privacy puckering
[3252.56 → 3256.40] Uh getting people to give you their information in exchange for very little
[3257.60 → 3262.64] Or nothing tricks the user into sharing more information than they intended to okay. All right
[3263.84 → 3268.88] Good name. Uh, okay. I will go with a couple of the more straightforward ones here. Good Tucker misdirection
[3268.88 → 3275.44] It's just called misdirection. Uh, would this be like, uh
[3276.72 → 3281.28] The download buttons problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Yeah, you nailed it. So, uh, you know
[3281.84 → 3287.20] Basically presented with a button in the fashion of a typical continuation button
[3287.76 → 3293.68] But it's actually something else, and you have to look somewhere else for the one like if you noticed when Microsoft offers you the Windows 11 upgrade
[3294.24 → 3298.24] You have to like hunt for don't do it. Yeah, for the don't do it. Yeah
[3298.24 → 3302.08] Um, uh, okay, okay. The next one is called
[3302.96 → 3304.96] confirm shaming
[3305.52 → 3308.96] Okay, so that would be when the prompt is like
[3309.60 → 3312.40] Uh, do you want to continue your subscription?
[3312.96 → 3314.40] Click the yes
[3314.40 → 3321.52] I want to keep supporting this company or do you not want to continue subscription click the no I'm a horrible person button nailed it
[3321.76 → 3324.80] Yeah, uh, don't forget the bait and switch
[3324.80 → 3326.56] Hmm
[3328.32 → 3329.20] What's on that one?
[3329.76 → 3336.08] Uh, it's its it seems like you're signing up for something that's awesome and cool and legit and then you're not or maybe
[3336.56 → 3340.56] It sounds like it's free and then after you've given them your contact information
[3340.56 → 3342.56] They prompt you to put in a credit card or something
[3342.80 → 3344.40] It's its your really close
[3344.40 → 3350.96] It's they advertise something free or at a greatly reduced price then say it is unavailable and
[3351.76 → 3358.08] Present similar options at higher prices or lesser quantity and the last one is roach motel
[3359.44 → 3363.12] Okay, I've actually heard of this, but I don't remember at all
[3364.48 → 3366.48] What it is
[3366.48 → 3368.48] Um
[3369.04 → 3375.28] No, yeah, I don't I don't know this one provides an easy path in, but a difficult path out got it
[3375.60 → 3382.16] So for example a business that would require subscribers to print and mail their opt-out or cancellation request
[3382.64 → 3384.64] Yeah, or like Amazon Prime
[3384.72 → 3388.96] Yeah, yeah, which is full of different kinds of dark. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry
[3389.04 → 3392.56] I completely hijacked whatever very interesting thing you were talking about
[3392.56 → 3397.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was unintentional with me when the eye is a dark pattern
[3399.36 → 3402.24] Uh when the IRS banned these uh
[3403.04 → 3411.60] These companies from hiding their free filing options both her block and intuit the makers of turbo tax left the agreement
[3412.96 → 3417.28] Which is awesome. I personally really enjoy the process of
[3417.28 → 3424.80] Um the government sending me a letter that tells me what I need to put in the box of the piece of paperwork that the government sends me
[3425.20 → 3427.28] Um, I think that's the dumbest thing ever
[3427.60 → 3431.36] I do think obviously some people are going to have more complicated taxes
[3431.68 → 3437.44] But for a vast yep for sure for a vast uh percentage of technically yes me as well
[3438.80 → 3440.80] For a vast percentage of the population
[3441.28 → 3445.92] Uh, it's pretty simple, and it's really stupid that you have to jump through so many hoops
[3445.92 → 3448.64] Um, that you have one full-time job
[3449.52 → 3451.84] Yeah, it shouldn't be that hard. You should be paying
[3452.88 → 3455.60] Zero dollars to process your tax return. Yeah
[3456.80 → 3460.16] You shouldn't even like to do it. You should basically just confirm
[3461.36 → 3463.68] It should be presented to you be like does this look wrong?
[3464.16 → 3470.72] I mean, okay, actually I was going to say I mean there are a lot of things that could conceivably need user intervention
[3470.72 → 3472.88] Like if you have deducted deductions for
[3473.44 → 3475.92] Dependence or something like that, but then I'm sitting here going well
[3475.92 → 3478.56] I mean, what's the point of the census if they don't know how many kids you have?
[3478.56 → 3480.88] Yeah, like what was the point of the birth certificate?
[3480.88 → 3483.28] Yeah, and it can be an opportunity to update things
[3483.68 → 3487.20] Yeah, like sure, but yeah, no, you're no you're right like confirm this information
[3487.76 → 3490.96] Correct cool. We missed out on a's like I don't know
[3490.96 → 3492.72] People in chat are saying that's how it works in the UK. Yeah
[3493.12 → 3496.72] Countries do this like this is not impossible. We missed out on a
[3496.72 → 3502.16] I forget how much money it is. It's either hundreds or thousands of dollars. It's a significant amount of money
[3502.80 → 3506.00] That you can put towards your kids post-secondary education
[3506.08 → 3509.96] but you have to apply for it before their second birthday or something and
[3510.70 → 3516.92] We missed the deadline and so you just don't get it, and I'm sitting here going well. This should just be automatic. There was somewhat is the
[3518.00 → 3523.10] There was something when I was growing up where if you put money into an account before you were I think it was 16
[3523.90 → 3528.22] The government would like to match it or something, and it was for your post-secondary education, but
[3529.26 → 3531.26] If you were 17
[3531.26 → 3535.42] You know what you're not allowed to save for post-secondary anymore if you're in post-secondary
[3535.66 → 3539.58] They don't want to support you in post-secondary more or only if you're 15 like what
[3540.46 → 3544.86] What is this line? I yeah, I don't know. I don't know man. It was stupid
[3546.14 → 3548.14] So frustrating
[3548.14 → 3552.38] Anyway, I'm happy that at least baby steps are being taken
[3552.86 → 3559.74] Uh to get away from the lobbying turbo hell that has been her block and turbo tax and all these other companies
[3560.14 → 3563.90] um trying to just charge people money
[3565.26 → 3567.10] For them to pay money to the government
[3568.38 → 3575.82] Um, which what a useful industry incredibly irrelevant definitely exist doesn't need to exist at all is literally just
[3576.78 → 3578.78] bad for everyone except for
[3579.34 → 3584.94] Specifically probably only the heads of these companies which is just like brush can we just stop?
[3585.26 → 3588.78] Can we have all the people that work there go do more useful things?
[3589.50 → 3591.50] That would be great
[3591.82 → 3596.86] Wow, that's very heartless Luke. Nope an industry is under threat accountants
[3597.18 → 3603.26] An industry is under threat close it all down, and you would have those people just go get different jobs
[3603.26 → 3605.82] They will have jobs brutal accountants are in high demand
[3607.10 → 3609.42] Not everyone who works there is an accountant boom checkmate
[3613.10 → 3616.54] What about the developers who create this very useful software that we're hiring
[3621.66 → 3625.98] Hey, what about the evil executives and lobbyists who work on keep
[3625.98 → 3627.98] They'll be fine
[3627.98 → 3632.14] They've probably made enough already. What about the janitor who cleans the office?
[3634.62 → 3636.62] Honestly, I'm sure they'll still be employed
[3638.22 → 3640.06] Someone else can move into that office. I think they'll make it
[3640.06 → 3640.62] Yeah
[3640.62 → 3642.46] I think they'll be okay
[3642.46 → 3643.50] All right fair enough
[3643.98 → 3645.50] Okay, I'm kidding you guys
[3646.14 → 3647.26] Relax, I'm up
[3647.26 → 3651.10] I'm not actually defending the uh the tax software
[3651.74 → 3653.42] It's an it's an extortion industry
[3653.42 → 3654.06] It's a meme
[3654.62 → 3655.82] What do you want to talk about next?
[3655.82 → 3657.58] Reddit may become unsearchable
[3657.58 → 3659.90] This would actually really hurt me because
[3660.54 → 3663.42] Legitimately a way that I google things now as I append Reddit
[3663.42 → 3668.86] Um, which I know that some companies actually know that, and they try to hijack
[3668.86 → 3673.02] The top search results of when you put Reddit on the end and stuff, but those are pretty easy to spot
[3673.02 → 3676.06] So yeah, it's okay, uh, but Google has become so like
[3676.70 → 3680.06] Unusable that I actually do that so this will suck
[3680.06 → 3685.90] But uh Reddit is reportedly threatening to block web crawlers including from search engines like google and bing
[3685.90 → 3693.42] It cannot reach an agreement with generative AI if it cannot reach an agreement with generative AI companies to pay for data collected from the site
[3693.66 → 3699.58] Sources inside Reddit report that the company believes Reddit can survive without search. I actually disagree
[3700.06 → 3700.46] Me too
[3700.46 → 3707.90] The amount of organic browsing that I do on Reddit compared to the amount of oh, I came across this article by searching
[3708.30 → 3709.18] Oh
[3709.18 → 3712.62] I'm on Reddit, and this is an interesting thread. I'll read for a bit. Okay. Goodbye
[3712.62 → 3721.18] I don't just go to Reddit personally. Yeah, I never just go to Reddit. I almost always end up there by accident. Yep
[3722.22 → 3726.06] I uh, I don't know man. I read it on the one hand
[3727.02 → 3732.86] Has weathered some serious storms and has demonstrated that they are quite resilient on the other hand
[3733.26 → 3741.58] There's a fine line between resilient and confident and arrogant and hubris
[3741.58 → 3743.58] um
[3743.58 → 3754.54] Over 500 news organizations including the New York times Reuters and the Washington Post have installed a blocker that prevents their content from being collected and used to train AI
[3755.10 → 3757.10] I uh, have bad news for them
[3757.10 → 3759.10] um, that isn't working
[3759.66 → 3761.66] so
[3761.66 → 3762.46] Cool
[3762.46 → 3770.30] um, and I guess the difference between those news organizations and Reddit is that Reddit's management is tech-savvy enough to know that
[3771.10 → 3774.38] Yeah, yeah, I uh, I don't know what to tell you
[3776.22 → 3776.86] I
[3776.86 → 3778.86] I can't remember
[3779.02 → 3780.46] What um
[3780.46 → 3784.86] What it's called and this isn't a topic, but I was reading a discussion
[3785.26 → 3786.86] um, the other day about how
[3787.50 → 3791.90] Some sites are like honey potting junk data
[3793.02 → 3797.10] In order to like to wreck the data sets that some of these AI crawlers have
[3797.10 → 3798.14] Interesting
[3798.14 → 3806.14] So they're they're creating a bunch of a bunch of false information so that anything that crawls their stuff without permission
[3806.94 → 3809.58] Uh is going to have bad results
[3810.70 → 3812.46] If that makes sense
[3812.46 → 3816.78] Interesting. So you what you would think idea. Yeah, I think it's a matter of time before the crawlers
[3816.78 → 3822.54] Figure out how to work around that. I mean as someone who was recently tasked with creating a crawler
[3829.02 → 3830.94] Oh, you're talking about me. Yeah, sure. I don't know
[3831.50 → 3834.14] Like I mean, I would you find a way around that?
[3834.78 → 3836.14] Yeah, but then it's like
[3836.94 → 3838.22] It's slower
[3838.22 → 3844.30] Yes, because you have to you have to hide where the traffic is coming from your have to your have to
[3845.10 → 3847.90] Take a more subversive approach to collecting the data
[3848.14 → 3854.38] This is one of those arms race situations where like you could get a bunch of websites that report on the same thing
[3854.86 → 3857.74] um to agree to put like one piece of junk
[3858.54 → 3864.46] And then if none of them have agreements with these things and that piece of junk ends up showing in results
[3864.46 → 3866.46] It's like okay, we got you
[3867.26 → 3875.02] Um, then you can use legal action stuff like that. Yeah, but like realistically a lot of these crawlers are going to be coming out of places like china or Russia
[3875.58 → 3879.26] Where it doesn't realistically what are you going to do about it? Nothing. Yeah. Yeah
[3879.42 → 3884.54] What you're going to sue someone in China for using your data incorrectly and like?
[3886.30 → 3888.30] Okay
[3888.30 → 3891.90] Yeah, good luck with that right. It's its it's been an interesting thing to watch
[3892.22 → 3892.94] um
[3892.94 → 3897.74] I'm of the opinion that yeah, I don't I don't see any way that you're really going to stop it personally
[3897.90 → 3900.30] I don't think it's realistic. Yeah, if people want to take it
[3900.30 → 3905.26] They're going to take it and this is the same conversation we had before where I was saying that I um
[3906.14 → 3909.42] Even though there's like, uh chip restrictions going into china
[3909.90 → 3915.98] I think Chinese AI developers are not necessarily at any bigger disadvantage than North American ones because there's more
[3917.26 → 3918.86] uh legal pressure here
[3918.86 → 3924.86] So they have like hardware restrictions and over here we have legal pressure
[3925.02 → 3929.02] Well, they also have their governmental restrictions in terms of like I'm
[3929.58 → 3935.66] My understanding is that um, there's there are restrictions on the outputs of large language models
[3935.66 → 3942.30] I think you'd have to be really careful about those things don't exist over here in sort of the land of the free as we
[3942.86 → 3947.50] As we are familiar with people referring to themselves. I think there's still some
[3949.26 → 3953.50] Well, there's some that I know have been uh self-imposed by some of the larger ones
[3953.50 → 3959.58] But I also know that there are much smaller alms that will output anything. Oh, yeah, that's definitely and
[3959.58 → 3963.18] I know self-hosted access those here. So yeah, yeah, I don't know
[3963.74 → 3967.26] Effectively there isn't really a limitation on if you're willing to dig for it. Yeah
[3968.06 → 3972.70] Anyway, that's a developing and sort of under an uninteresting conversation for most people
[3973.18 → 3979.42] Uh, should we do the wing? Can we jump to that sim swap? Actually, I before we do that. Yes, we're going to do the sim swap
[3979.42 → 3983.26] Let's have some fun with the wing, but first I want to talk about some cool stuff that's happening on the store. Ah
[3984.06 → 3986.06] Um, oh
[3986.78 → 3991.98] Where is it? Dang it? Why can I not find this I can make my surprise noises. There we go. Yeah
[3992.86 → 3997.18] Okay, we're launching our premium sport joggers. They are 49.99
[3997.74 → 3999.74] 9. Why did I say that 49.99?
[4000.22 → 4006.70] Uh, they feature a nylon spandex blend, and they have super cool reflective taping on the side. Yeah
[4007.26 → 4012.22] Um, it looks pretty I have been I have been demoing these for quite some time
[4013.18 → 4020.30] I actually yeah, I've had a pair of these for almost a year now, and they look and feel flipping awesome
[4020.70 → 4024.70] And this stripe here is like a reflective
[4025.26 → 4026.78] Were you wearing these in Taiwan?
[4026.78 → 4027.18] Yeah
[4027.18 → 4035.10] Yeah, that's actually kind of cool. I noticed you were wearing some like, you know, not Costco jeans, and I was like hey
[4035.10 → 4039.74] Those are actually like pretty sweet, and I wasn't sure what they were, and apparently they were these yeah, so they're super stretchy
[4039.74 → 4040.70] um
[4040.70 → 4046.06] Um, they are not I would say the most ventilated
[4046.62 → 4050.14] So if you are expecting to like to go hard in them
[4050.62 → 4053.18] Uh, they are not they're not the most ventilated
[4053.18 → 4058.54] But if you are uh, if you're oh, yeah, see that's a that's a photo. I have that one up on my screen right now
[4058.62 → 4061.42] Yeah, that photo is really cool. That's a perfect shot of how cool
[4061.42 → 4067.50] They look zipper pockets because I flipping hate heck yeah losing stuff. Uh, it drives me absolutely crazy
[4068.22 → 4073.10] Um, but yeah, there's their super comfy, uh, super stretchy. I think they look awesome
[4073.42 → 4077.02] Uh, those are launching today also on the store today. We've got
[4077.74 → 4078.54] um
[4078.54 → 4084.62] Backpacks are back on the store now featuring standard zipper pulls instead of the weak carabiner
[4084.62 → 4091.34] So our original stock is all gone new orders will ship as soon as our new delivery arrives that should be in the next couple of weeks
[4091.82 → 4096.30] We're apparently advertising by November 20th, and you will be included
[4096.86 → 4099.34] In the list of people who will get the new
[4099.90 → 4105.18] Updated carabiner pulls along with the little piece of hardware for swapping out the standard pulls
[4105.18 → 4107.66] So when I say standard pulls, I just mean like any
[4108.22 → 4112.22] Normal zipper pull that's on there now, and then we'll get you
[4112.78 → 4119.42] Once we've got everyone with the old wheat carabiners updated, um, it's just taking a lot of time in production
[4119.50 → 4121.74] We're going to get those out as soon as we possibly can
[4122.94 → 4127.18] This is interesting. We created a new promotional mechanism
[4128.22 → 4134.06] We can now do free shipping with your entire order when you buy a specific product
[4134.94 → 4141.58] Um, I think we did this with the luxe backpack launch. Oh, did it not work? Oh, that's right. It didn't work then
[4141.58 → 4145.90] Um, so we did it manually because it was a very, very low quantity
[4146.38 → 4147.34] Now
[4147.34 → 4150.38] We can do it automated, and we're running a quick test
[4150.94 → 4152.54] so today only
[4153.42 → 4154.78] today only
[4154.78 → 4161.10] Because we have no idea how many people are going to redeem this we're not 100 sure how much it'll cost
[4161.58 → 4163.10] um, so we're we are
[4163.82 → 4165.82] You are our guinea pigs
[4165.98 → 4172.30] For today only if you buy a plaid flannel not a mystery plaid flannel good gravy. Where's the plaid flannel?
[4172.30 → 4173.58] Okay, there it is. You find it eventually

[4192.22 → 4193.34] It has pockets
[4195.18 → 4198.86] It took me 30 days to notice it has pocketed all right. Thanks Andrew
[4198.86 → 4204.54] The weird part is I did the same thing when I was just reading in my head. Yeah, I was like Thomas harper what?
[4204.86 → 4210.22] Yeah, why did I okay? Anyway, it doesn't matter the point is uh, the plaid flannel free shipping for your entire order
[4210.22 → 4217.02] And finally, we are taking signups for our long teased magnetic cable management product
[4220.06 → 4225.82] Why do they have these stuck on wood? They're not they're not they're not they're on the magnetic plates that you can screw into things
[4225.82 → 4228.86] So we've got a bunch of really cool cable organization stuff

[4485.82 → 4487.82] Let me see
[4490.70 → 4492.70] Oh, I mean blazon warrior yeah
[4495.58 → 4500.06] Can we be less mind melded because that would actually make our conversations
[4500.06 → 4505.18] a lot more interesting for me yeah, I just didn't know all right you're going to say already
[4506.14 → 4510.30] What's the point of us even talking we should just sit here on land show and read the doc together and go
[4511.02 → 4514.78] Hmm yeah, that's what I think so that's what Luke would think cool
[4515.58 → 4520.78] Yeah, I'd be a lot less fun for you guys to watch I guess yeah, okay, which which which route are you going?
[4521.58 → 4522.70] um
[4522.70 → 4524.70] I'm going to go with bourbon glaze
[4524.70 → 4528.62] I'm sorry am I supposed to be doing talking points?
[4529.18 → 4529.58] um

[4540.22 → 4546.22] They've got daring flavours from mild to wild like sizzling maple which was previously known as maple cayenne
[4546.62 → 4548.30] smoke house and bourbon glaze
[4548.30 → 4556.14] If you're a braver man than me, you can even try their California reaper we've done which offers up seething heat up to
[4557.34 → 4558.54] 2.2 million Scoville
[4559.74 → 4567.26] The question here should Linus try this next time on the land show I have I done their reaper have I done their ghost pepper I'm pretty sure we've done both it is
[4567.90 → 4569.34] extremely hot
[4569.34 → 4571.42] Very hot it's very, very hot
[4572.06 → 4578.30] The best part is that savage jerky is all natural with no preservatives artificial ingredients or gluten plus they're high in protein

[4597.50 → 4601.42] Um in the meantime why don't we move on to our next topic
[4603.74 → 4605.50] Oh we're supposed to do merch messages
[4606.62 → 4609.34] Oh we'll do the full thing after let's do three merch messages
[4610.14 → 4613.18] No, no we'll do it we'll do it at some point just he just doesn't want to switch his phone
[4613.18 → 4613.82] I really don't
[4614.62 → 4617.50] I like really don't I've been hands-on with it already
[4618.06 → 4621.66] Just to get all my apps loaded onto it and stuff like that go through the setup wizard, and it's
[4621.66 → 4627.82] Well, I'll let you experience it okay, okay hit me Dan sure it was good I like this one
[4629.10 → 4635.90] What features have been removed from modern computers that you still can't understand windows search being awful does not count
[4636.86 → 4637.26] oh
[4637.26 → 4644.22] They took the easy one how about ir file transfer
[4646.70 → 4648.70] Did you ever use it no
[4649.42 → 4651.18] But I was pretty young and had no reason to
[4651.90 → 4656.06] quickly beam you know a file from one thing to another
[4656.06 → 4662.06] And to be clear I mean it's not like apple doesn't have an equivalent now with airdrop
[4662.78 → 4664.46] But on the windows side of things
[4665.26 → 4669.90] How the do I just get a file to someone we've we've talked about this on Wayne show before yeah
[4670.54 → 4675.42] Yeah, it's incredibly frustrating. I mean okay. Okay crossover cables. There's another one
[4675.50 → 4680.54] They do technically still exist you technically could just take two computers and connect them and
[4680.54 → 4683.02] manually configure a bunch of bull
[4684.22 → 4691.18] But why is it honestly though really I would like the networking people to come at me like I'm five
[4692.38 → 4698.14] Why is it that we haven't just built functionality into Ethernet adapters such that
[4698.78 → 4702.94] The default behaviour when I just connect to Windows computers to each other
[4703.58 → 4709.10] Isn't to act as a crossover cable because my understanding is you don't even need to use a proper crossover cable anymore
[4709.10 → 4713.74] You can use any cable as a crossover cable that's my understanding don't quote me on that
[4713.98 → 4719.82] But why isn't why isn't it that when I plug in a crossover cable between two computers they aren't just immediately like
[4721.02 → 4726.38] Book here's the shared folder and I can just drag and drop a thing it's like ridiculous, so people brought this up last time
[4726.38 → 4732.22] We complained about this too and I forgot about it until now when they brought windows nearby share does it work let's try it
[4733.02 → 4734.14] Yeah
[4734.14 → 4736.86] Nearby share here nearby sharing settings
[4739.10 → 4741.10] uh
[4746.30 → 4748.78] Don't know if it's going to start detecting things and stuff
[4750.78 → 4753.10] That you want to stream okay it's on now what
[4756.22 → 4761.42] Here I'm just going to hide my screen for a second it's a nearby share did you turn it on yep
[4762.78 → 4766.78] Okay, you just click the thing, and it's working right there's no like confirm I didn't have a confirmation yeah
[4766.78 → 4768.78] I just clicked it um
[4769.74 → 4770.14] Okay
[4770.14 → 4771.58] Um
[4772.30 → 4774.70] Now what yeah, where do I go to do this?
[4775.82 → 4778.86] Uh, okay here. Let me just make sure there's nothing incriminating here
[4779.66 → 4780.78] um
[4780.78 → 4782.78] Share across devices
[4784.78 → 4790.46] Yeah sure okay yeah I don't think there's anything that incriminating on my screen, so what like i just
[4792.38 → 4796.70] Share with skype share okay
[4796.70 → 4808.94] Is this gonna work maybe that'd be cool is it actually this good can I go to your screen uh
[4809.90 → 4810.30] sure
[4812.22 → 4815.90] Did anything pop up I think it said it was going to go to downloads
[4815.90 → 4820.30] It's called ash ray x
[4820.70 → 4822.70] Oh
[4823.66 → 4823.90] No
[4824.78 → 4826.22] Yeah, I don't really see anything there
[4826.86 → 4827.58] No, uh
[4828.38 → 4830.86] Oh, wait is your date modified oldest to newest
[4833.98 → 4835.42] I mean I looked at the whole thing
[4835.42 → 4842.22] What is it called again?
[4842.22 → 4845.02] Mm-hmm ash ray x
[4845.90 → 4848.78] O a dash AXB it's not here bro
[4850.38 → 4853.42] Okay, I'll try sharing it again. I want to see what are you sharing it to?
[4854.46 → 4858.22] I'm sharing it to um, because this should be wanshow2-laptop
[4859.18 → 4862.78] Yeah, wanshow2-laptop. Okay, I clicked it. Okay, let's see what happens
[4862.78 → 4867.90] Is there any indication on your side that anything's happening nope?
[4869.74 → 4872.30] I just click it and then and then the dialogue goes away
[4876.46 → 4881.66] So is your nearby sharing configured to be on yeah look everyone nearby looks like it
[4882.38 → 4884.62] save files I received to downloads
[4885.50 → 4887.58] But it didn't prompt you in any way this is the wrong
[4888.30 → 4889.90] Downloads let's go users
[4889.90 → 4891.90] WAN2
[4893.98 → 4898.30] It shouldn't be that should be the right downloads folder yes, I know I'm just you know
[4898.86 → 4899.50] someone's gonna
[4900.62 → 4904.46] Try to point it out. Okay, it's definitely not there. Well perfect feature
[4904.86 → 4909.58] Um sick maybe we're doing it wrong check notifications chats blowing up
[4909.58 → 4914.06] They want you to check your notifications. It should have given me a notification. I would argue that
[4915.02 → 4916.06] Oh
[4916.06 → 4922.54] No, that's I started a live stream. Oh, we could watch wan show. Oh, we could watch garbage stream garbage drum stream
[4923.10 → 4925.58] Mm-hmm full plane exclusives giving away
[4926.38 → 4929.42] I mean, hey, that's basically the picture. I tried to send you that thumbnail
[4931.02 → 4933.02] The system works
[4933.10 → 4935.82] Okay, so do not disturb is on in their defence
[4935.82 → 4940.38] So I wouldn't have gotten the thing because do not disturb is on so okay, but it's also not in there
[4940.38 → 4943.82] I'll concede that but yes, there is Bluetooth on
[4944.62 → 4947.82] People are helping us. This is great live troubleshooting
[4949.42 → 4953.82] If that's a problem, okay, first yes, it's on and two if that's a problem
[4953.82 → 4958.94] It should prompt you that yeah, and I shouldn't have been able to select his computer and share to it
[4959.58 → 4961.58] Yeah, it should tell him
[4962.46 → 4966.86] Or both of us turn off DND. Why does that I mean do it?
[4968.62 → 4975.58] Do it you coward well, it's on because we're live on a show like there's a reason okay, it's off. Okay, I'm sharing with you again
[4975.66 → 4977.66] Okay, so here you go guys live demo
[4977.90 → 4982.70] Wan show 2 laptop, okay, it just goes away. It gives me no information whatsoever. I did
[4982.70 → 4984.70] Hey
[4985.82 → 4987.82] Save and open
[4988.14 → 4990.54] Okay with photos no way
[4991.74 → 4993.74] Hey you up
[4996.62 → 4999.98] Okay, so it works as long as you're you know
[5001.58 → 5003.90] Okay, not bad. Can you share with me?
[5005.34 → 5007.34] Probably
[5007.34 → 5015.82] Something that's kind of funny is I think there's a setting in teams to turn on DND anytime you're on a call
[5016.86 → 5018.46] Hmm
[5018.62 → 5023.74] So literally Microsoft's own software is going to block Microsoft's other software from working
[5024.22 → 5028.06] I mean you say that like it surprises you. I actually want to okay hold on
[5028.70 → 5030.70] Do not disturb
[5031.50 → 5034.46] Okay, so do not disturb is back on can you try to send me something again?
[5034.94 → 5036.94] Yeah, I sure can I
[5036.94 → 5044.06] Mean I didn't realize we were doing a detailed investigation into the uh, well, we are now reliability anything to delay the wing
[5046.94 → 5049.26] What okay, it just sent me a notification anyway
[5055.98 → 5059.18] So I don't know um
[5059.18 → 5061.18] Um
[5061.34 → 5064.54] Wait are they all coming through now? No, this just told me that it finished
[5065.66 → 5070.86] But I turned DND on and what I was hoping was that if I just manually opened the notifications panel
[5071.26 → 5076.78] Maybe it would show it in there. So like if DND is on, but you know a file is going to be shared you could grab it
[5077.18 → 5080.62] But then it just sent me the notification even though do not disturb is on so
[5082.06 → 5084.94] That's cool. Uh now I'm going to send you something
[5084.94 → 5086.94] Um
[5088.86 → 5092.70] Am I the only one who absolutely hates that windows even has a notification shade at all?
[5095.10 → 5100.46] No, not at all. I use them for absolutely nothing other than to get in my way when I'm trying to click something in the system tray
[5100.46 → 5102.46] You want to know something really fun?
[5102.54 → 5106.30] I learned that it has a notification tray thing right now
[5107.66 → 5111.58] I've never used it before I had no idea it was a thing people said check notifications
[5111.58 → 5114.38] I was like this is probably where it's going to be and then yeah, it was right there
[5116.14 → 5121.66] Yeah, occasionally I'll get like um, okay. I turned on my VR machine
[5122.30 → 5124.78] For the first time in like three weeks or something
[5125.66 → 5131.10] At some point like this was not recent this was a while back and that machine is signed in to float plane
[5131.18 → 5136.30] So that I can monitor chat, and so I can stream to float plane or something like it was signed in for some reason
[5136.30 → 5143.18] And I literally couldn't use my computer to click. I was trying to click something in the system tray
[5144.06 → 5150.54] I literally couldn't access it for over a minute because of every float plane upload that queued up
[5150.86 → 5154.62] Sorry, am I supposed to see something? Yeah, but you probably have DND on
[5158.06 → 5160.30] I don't even know where to set do not disturb in windows
[5161.02 → 5167.42] Just search do not I got it though find it you know, it's interesting my side gave me a little thing no way
[5167.74 → 5170.46] Yeah, okay, so let me do this again. I'm going to send it to you again
[5172.46 → 5174.46] Share
[5174.46 → 5177.34] With my own laptop one and then see the bottom left right-hand corner
[5178.30 → 5183.74] Oh sharing to Sancho one laptop download up PNG waiting for Sancho one laptop to accept
[5184.62 → 5186.94] That's totally fine. Did it not do that for you?
[5186.94 → 5187.66] No
[5187.66 → 5188.70] What the heck?
[5188.70 → 5194.86] So it has the ability to punch through do not disturb, and it might just not inform you that it's waiting for a transfer or something
[5195.66 → 5199.90] You're Windows 11. Are you Windows 10? I am. Oh, maybe it got better
[5202.54 → 5203.98] Interesting
[5203.98 → 5207.18] I thought we both got force upgraded to Windows 11. I just showed up one day
[5207.18 → 5210.06] It was Windows 11 probably someone accidentally clicked it. Hmm
[5210.62 → 5212.70] I mean that's what my kids did with the computer downstairs
[5212.70 → 5217.26] I was really annoyed because as far as I can tell there wasn't an easy way to go back hot take. I like it
[5218.14 → 5220.30] I run Windows 11 at home. I've never looked back
[5221.66 → 5223.66] Really? Yep
[5225.18 → 5229.34] Do you go on I just haven't had a single issue literally never what yep
[5232.38 → 5233.42] Zero
[5233.42 → 5236.86] I also noticed you didn't even bother to move your start menu to the proper
[5237.50 → 5239.58] Nope position, and it's in the middle at home
[5240.38 → 5242.38] And I like it. What about the
[5243.82 → 5246.22] Okay, are you taking the piss? No
[5247.66 → 5249.58] What about combined taskbar icons?
[5250.46 → 5256.14] I would lose my mind if I couldn't expand. I've actually been combining them since like Windows 7. Yeah, I don't know
[5256.14 → 5261.42] How do you guys work effectively? I didn't know that was new with Windows 11. I've been doing that. Furthermore, I'm an executive. You think I do real work?
[5261.42 → 5263.42] Hmm
[5263.66 → 5265.66] It's all emails dude. Yeah
[5265.66 → 5267.66] Yeah, okay
[5267.74 → 5268.78] Valid
[5268.78 → 5270.78] You got your email client and then like that's it
[5270.78 → 5275.98] I'll have teams and slack and discord for talking to a few creators and a browser
[5277.02 → 5282.06] Actually probably a few browsers and then a few windows of each browser's browser
[5282.62 → 5285.18] And then a ton of tabs in each one of those windows
[5286.38 → 5290.30] And then I just like wreck my ram and that's there we go
[5290.30 → 5295.98] Yeah, I'm free browser windows and teams. That's my quadrants. Yeah. Yep. It's inefficient
[5296.94 → 5301.42] What do you mean? Oh, I guess if you have them open at the same time always I have three monitors. Yeah
[5301.74 → 5307.98] Gotta use the screen real estate dude. Yeah. Yeah. I have a big monitor. I miss yeah. Furthermore, I miss my uh multi monitors
[5309.34 → 5314.94] I like actually I I I think I'm an outlier on the third monitor productivity
[5314.94 → 5316.30] step
[5316.30 → 5320.54] Really? I think I actually use it more than most people do
[5321.58 → 5328.30] Oh, I mean I was a big third monitor guy when I was at NCI. Yeah, I had four actually because they say like the second monitor is like a big
[5328.62 → 5332.94] Productivity step, but then the third monitor is supposed to be this like tiny single digit percentage one
[5332.94 → 5338.94] I I I needed all four so the three where I had um
[5341.02 → 5343.02] I had our internal system
[5343.02 → 5348.54] Which I think you probably remember like our internal like yeah content management system and like product management system
[5349.18 → 5351.18] and then I would have um
[5351.90 → 5357.58] One monitor would have a second one of those so that I could refer to and utilize both
[5357.58 → 5362.30] And then would also I would have as like my alternate view on that one our live site
[5363.42 → 5366.78] And then the third one I would usually have like manufacturer
[5367.42 → 5372.62] Product info so that I could uh, or I would have our Canadian and our US internal systems
[5372.86 → 5379.34] And then I would have manufacturer product info and then my last monitor was for uh internal uh intra-office messages
[5380.06 → 5385.02] Which some people used MSN some people used other things I think but basically like internal comes
[5385.02 → 5391.02] I have stuff like you know in teams or in my situation more often, but I do also do it in teams
[5391.34 → 5394.30] Uh, your call window is a new window
[5396.30 → 5402.62] So I have a dedicated spot where that goes whenever I'm in a live call for teams or slack that goes in one dedicated spot
[5403.18 → 5405.18] I never put anything else there
[5405.58 → 5409.82] That way I can always see everyone that's in the call is my mic open or not all that kind of stuff
[5410.70 → 5415.82] It's but if I had two monitors that would take away extremely valuable real estate
[5416.22 → 5419.58] But because it's on a third monitor, it's nowhere near as valuable real estate
[5419.58 → 5424.86] So I can dedicate room to that, and then I'm never hunting for it to mute and unmute my mic which is
[5425.58 → 5429.26] Immediately notable time save you should get good and get a hardware mute button
[5430.46 → 5431.82] Yeah
[5431.82 → 5434.30] Got him for a while there. I don't know if it's possible now
[5434.30 → 5439.66] But for a while there you couldn't rebind it in slack, and it was a really annoying key bind that I really remember
[5440.14 → 5445.10] I this is this was a long time ago, and I've never looked at it since this is like a very long time ago
[5445.34 → 5447.18] It's very possibly changed ever since
[5447.18 → 5449.82] Linus is going to yell at me, but I should look into it again go SLR
[5452.14 → 5454.14] Like legitimately go SLRs
[5454.14 → 5459.34] I mean there's a whole thing now though Dan like they're not getting driver development anymore. They've like abandoned it
[5459.34 → 5461.34] They're like kind of sketchy
[5461.66 → 5464.54] Someone in chat if I can find it
[5465.74 → 5467.02] Where'd it go?
[5467.02 → 5469.02] The name was archangel of death
[5469.74 → 5471.74] Which was really intense
[5471.74 → 5472.30] Fringe
[5473.34 → 5475.66] You're making fun of float plate people's usernames
[5476.14 → 5478.14] Come on
[5478.14 → 5480.14] Maybe they just are you don't know
[5480.14 → 5484.62] Um, okay, I can't find it, but they were saying that Windows 11 has an annoying bug where when you put
[5485.34 → 5487.98] Windows explorer windows behind something they have a
[5488.86 → 5491.42] They pop forward see like I've never had that happen
[5492.62 → 5495.50] I've had like no issues with the windows side of things
[5496.62 → 5497.82] I don't know
[5497.82 → 5499.82] All right, so
[5499.82 → 5503.50] Just so you know I'm also Windows 11 at home. I also have no problems
[5509.26 → 5513.26] Jeez man, I actually finally reformatted my system
[5513.26 → 5516.14] So why do you wait? Why do you resist that one changing then?
[5516.14 → 5518.86] I don't know habit just
[5518.86 → 5521.50] Just I just don't care like honestly
[5522.22 → 5529.10] It's more that I just I'm I'm not I'm not keen on putting in the work to reopen all the tabs that I like open
[5529.82 → 5535.02] Yeah, it just that's how little difference Windows 10 versus Windows 11 makes to me on a machine where all I ever do
[5535.02 → 5542.54] Is look at these three side by side things so honestly I feel exactly the same way one of my systems force upgraded
[5543.18 → 5545.18] And I was just like
[5545.18 → 5547.18] All right
[5547.18 → 5550.54] It's not worth the time to me to force this back down to Windows 10
[5551.18 → 5555.74] When I could just single button click on all the rest of the computers and now I'm just running Windows 11 with me
[5555.74 → 5558.46] It was that I finally upgraded
[5558.70 → 5559.50] um
[5559.50 → 5561.50] I finally got rid of the
[5561.82 → 5562.54] bad
[5562.54 → 5568.94] Ancient windows install remember I talked to you about this when we were doing the AMD challenge my windows install is messed up
[5568.94 → 5575.50] It's been that sometimes happens multiple platforms and most importantly it was installed on a NVMe raid
[5576.38 → 5580.14] So even though I'm no longer running NVMe raid for my boot drive
[5580.62 → 5586.06] I have to have NVMe raid drivers installed, or it will blue screen instead of actually booting and
[5586.62 → 5589.34] That has been inconvenient a couple of times
[5589.34 → 5590.06] um
[5590.94 → 5591.98] So finally I
[5592.86 → 5593.10] I
[5593.10 → 5593.18] I
[5594.86 → 5597.34] Treated myself to a really stupid boot drive
[5597.66 → 5601.82] I picked up an octane boot drive because this is my last chance to run octane I'm like you know what
[5602.38 → 5607.10] I'm going to see if I can find a scenario where it like matters at all, and maybe it'll be a video or something
[5607.10 → 5609.18] But I'm gonna I'm going to run octane
[5609.18 → 5612.70] So I have a single octane drive instead of you know rated stupidity
[5612.70 → 5617.18] Um and as I was installing windows doing a fresh install
[5617.58 → 5623.58] I realized that the drive that I had put in to install from was a Windows 11 drive, and I was like
[5625.34 → 5629.50] Yeah, yeah, exactly like I could take 20 minutes and I could whatever with that said
[5629.50 → 5634.06] I have had some problems with Windows 11 on other machines
[5634.94 → 5637.74] My kids upgraded the VR machine to Windows 11
[5638.46 → 5642.70] Unbeknownst to me and undecided by me because they probably just clicked on it
[5642.70 → 5643.10] Yeah
[5643.10 → 5645.74] And then the issue that I had was that it wouldn't go to sleep anymore
[5645.74 → 5648.30] So I had to go in, and I had to play around with some
[5648.38 → 5650.94] I think it was it ended up being network driver jigger
[5651.18 → 5653.58] In order to get the thing to stay asleep because it would just
[5654.06 → 5659.42] Immediately wake up because for whatever reason the network driver was kind of bugged in Windows 11 or something like that
[5659.90 → 5665.98] So I'm not saying that every experience is going to be perfect and smooth like Luke's was or like mine was on my personal rig
[5665.98 → 5671.42] Yeah, I'm not I'm not suggesting it necessarily. I just I run it on my work pc
[5671.74 → 5673.34] I run it on my work laptop
[5673.34 → 5677.82] Yeah, that I'm not sure if you're supposed to do is that approved internally yet sure
[5679.10 → 5685.02] Approved what got him running Windows 11 on your work stuff. Yeah, I thought we're all Windows 10 still
[5686.54 → 5688.54] Why does it matter? Why would it matter for Luke?
[5688.54 → 5694.46] Well, just no because well, okay because no way this came up this came up in conversation. I asked you about this Luke
[5695.02 → 5696.06] Didn't I?
[5696.06 → 5699.74] Somebody actually asked me. Manchu is turning into a meeting again. Let's go. Yeah
[5700.30 → 5705.90] Somebody asked me is it uh, is it okay if I install Windows 11, which was actually beautiful. I really appreciate that
[5706.38 → 5708.38] uh, and I think it was uh
[5710.14 → 5712.14] Do you know you're going to like it?
[5712.14 → 5716.86] Mine was another unintentional situation. I didn't want it to happen. It just did. I personally
[5717.26 → 5724.46] Disabled TPM modules in the motherboard bias on my computers at home so that it can't automatically upgrade itself
[5724.46 → 5728.86] That sounds like such a dad thing to do
[5730.22 → 5735.82] I hate Windows 11. I can't work it destroys my productivity. Here's a question. Okay, pull them out with a pair of pliers
[5735.82 → 5740.86] You know you can't uncombined taskbar icons, right? That's new. Yeah, so I might switch but okay
[5741.18 → 5744.22] I mean it made me furious when um
[5745.10 → 5749.66] Initially Luke if you bring up your bring up your start menu. Yeah, or your taskbar right click it
[5750.38 → 5752.38] Just the taskbar itself. Oh
[5752.78 → 5754.78] When task manager wasn't here
[5755.98 → 5763.42] And look I know control shift escape blah blah blah blah blah my, but that is no actually not a very natural
[5763.98 → 5769.26] Position for me. Yeah, whereas my hand is almost always on my mouse right click task. My like that's muscle memory for me
[5769.50 → 5775.34] Do not take that away. They brought that back clearly that happened so fast. I think it was an exec
[5776.22 → 5781.50] So that's my theory someone really high up was like what the f**k give me this back put it back now
[5781.50 → 5785.34] I didn't put back anything else. I don't remember the exact timeline
[5785.58 → 5789.42] Yeah, I think it was my work laptop that flipped first
[5790.22 → 5795.98] And I didn't switch any of the other stuff until they implemented that, and then I switched everything because I drove me nuts
[5796.30 → 5797.82] Right when you told me to right-click it
[5797.82 → 5803.42] I knew where you're going with it because I remembered that that was so annoying. Here's a question though. Yeah, is yours is your
[5804.38 → 5806.86] Icons are they centred or left, left aligned?
[5808.14 → 5811.66] Oh left you left aligned everything. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I decided
[5812.54 → 5814.78] That I was going to try it for a while
[5815.74 → 5818.54] I was like I'm almost certainly gonna left align these
[5819.50 → 5824.70] But you know some designer out there thought this was a neat idea. Let me try it for a little
[5824.70 → 5826.14] Yeah back in
[5826.14 → 5830.14] 1998 or whenever the heck apple started putting them in the middle like it's not cool today
[5830.14 → 5835.26] It's not trendy. I just don't care the windows search is so useless. I
[5836.06 → 5838.06] Pretty much never open the start menu
[5839.90 → 5842.70] Like actually I manually find my stuff these days
[5842.70 → 5848.62] I open file explorer and I go to the thing that I want instead of trying to type it in if it's a window setting
[5849.02 → 5852.30] If it's a window setting, I'll type it in, but that's very rare for me
[5852.30 → 5854.30] It's more about land marking my mouse position
[5855.34 → 5860.22] Because I will I won't window e for file explorer. I just click it
[5860.94 → 5864.38] Um, so I I go down all the way down to the left
[5864.38 → 5865.34] I don't have to think about it
[5865.34 → 5869.50] I don't have to look at it, and then it's like over a corner because you're a single monitor person as well
[5869.50 → 5873.02] Mm-hmm interesting. I wonder if that's part of it. Furthermore, I don't pin it to the test
[5873.02 → 5876.22] I can't do the same thing. It would slide onto my side to the taskbar
[5876.22 → 5880.14] I pin it right next to the start button. Okay, so I go all the way down landmark
[5880.14 → 5886.86] Yep, and then it's right there. So for me, it's more just that I putting it in the middle means I have to like
[5887.66 → 5891.74] Figure out where my cursor is and carry it to where it needs to go, which is stupid
[5892.38 → 5895.90] Why am I doing that with multiple monitors, though? I don't have a huge
[5896.70 → 5899.82] I could like digitally raise the side ones to make a
[5900.70 → 5906.78] A trap or something but like that is such a stupid workaround that if you ever did that I would feel bad for you
[5906.86 → 5909.42] Yeah, I did not do that. I wouldn't even like you anymore
[5910.78 → 5913.10] That's it. That's the line. That's actually the line
[5913.98 → 5915.98] I took my three monitors
[5916.46 → 5920.62] And I digitally configured two of them to be three pixels higher than the middle one
[5920.62 → 5927.66] So that I could trap my mouse in a little monitor trough so that I could no that is just a solution
[5928.62 → 5930.62] I didn't say it was a good one
[5932.46 → 5934.46] I'm losing so much respect for you
[5934.46 → 5936.46] For me, I didn't even do it
[5936.46 → 5938.46] Just the idea
[5938.46 → 5939.42] What do you mean?
[5939.42 → 5941.42] I'm going to need you to move offices
[5943.02 → 5944.06] Oh my god
[5944.06 → 5948.46] Uh, we have one more merch message to do if you uh, yeah, if you want
[5948.46 → 5952.70] I can't believe how much shame I just got for literally not even doing something
[5952.70 → 5955.18] Well, I mean to me, it's the fact that you thought of it
[5957.50 → 5960.94] I mean, I'm probably going to leave just because both of you use Windows 11
[5960.94 → 5962.94] So I don't
[5964.38 → 5967.18] They brought back uncombined taskbar icons
[5967.18 → 5969.34] I will say it's its prettier
[5970.54 → 5972.46] Yeah, but if you want pretty you should just run vista
[5973.34 → 5977.58] Best look controversial opinion best looking windows like tons of issues with that
[5978.22 → 5981.18] Well, yeah, why does your operating system being pretty matter?
[5981.58 → 5984.46] I mean that's really what are I doing with my computer these days, bro?
[5985.42 → 5989.58] I just use chrome. I should just have a Chromebook. Who cares? Everything is just chrome
[5989.58 → 5991.10] I mean
[5991.74 → 5993.74] That's that's the future Linus thinks going to happen
[5993.74 → 5994.46] Arch Linux
[5994.46 → 5997.50] I think it's coming. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's scary. I don't like that
[5997.50 → 5998.62] You've officially condemned
[5998.94 → 6000.94] I bet you our workflows
[6001.34 → 6006.46] I bet you my current workflow is more similar to goldens than most other people in the company
[6008.54 → 6009.02] Really?
[6009.02 → 6010.78] So he probably spends most of his time
[6010.78 → 6012.06] You clean out your desk every day?
[6012.62 → 6012.86] like
[6014.30 → 6018.22] He probably spends most of his time in like browsers and messaging apps
[6018.78 → 6019.82] Yeah, and that's what I do
[6020.78 → 6023.34] I almost exclusively live in browsers and messaging apps
[6023.74 → 6025.98] Script review I'd still tend to do in word
[6025.98 → 6027.42] That's how work works
[6027.42 → 6030.86] Alex brought me a script in Google Docs today
[6031.10 → 6033.34] And we ended up doing the review in Google Docs
[6033.34 → 6035.90] And uh, it was mostly okay
[6035.90 → 6037.10] What did you not like?
[6038.22 → 6039.90] Um, because we have found
[6039.90 → 6042.22] Yes, oh, no, he pointed at me what now?
[6042.22 → 6042.78] Uh-oh
[6042.78 → 6043.42] We have found
[6044.30 → 6045.98] I don't know if this is applicable for Linus
[6045.98 → 6051.66] I'm just saying we have found that some people don't like certain solutions because they just don't know everything that you can do with them
[6052.62 → 6053.82] I know how to use Google Docs
[6054.38 → 6055.66] Yeah, but do you though?
[6055.66 → 6055.90] Yes
[6056.46 → 6059.74] Maybe we could show you the magic of Google Docs
[6059.74 → 6062.30] I know how to use Google Docs
[6062.94 → 6063.58] Okay, all right
[6063.58 → 6064.30] So what can I do?
[6064.30 → 6066.22] Did you know that you can live collaborate?
[6066.38 → 6071.42] One of the problems with Google Docs is that your settings are on a per-document basis
[6071.66 → 6076.06] So if someone brings you a doc that doesn't have the correct spacing set
[6076.06 → 6078.86] So one of the things that really bothers me is automatic double-spacing
[6079.26 → 6081.02] I don't like pressing control enter
[6081.74 → 6083.58] In order to get a single space
[6083.58 → 6087.58] And so and the reason is not just like an irrational hatred of double-spacing
[6087.58 → 6092.70] It's because it's not efficient on the prompter and usually when I'm editing text it's for a Teleprompter
[6093.26 → 6094.54] You can change default settings
[6095.34 → 6096.06] You can
[6096.70 → 6097.10] But what?
[6097.10 → 6098.62] I think that's per user
[6098.62 → 6100.30] Yeah, it's per no it's per document
[6101.18 → 6103.18] No, you can change your default settings
[6103.66 → 6105.42] Sure, but that doesn't help me. Sorry, sorry, sorry
[6105.42 → 6108.14] That doesn't help me if someone brings in a document they created
[6108.14 → 6112.62] Okay, new solution we can use the API to force a change to everyone in the organization
[6112.62 → 6113.66] There's a template
[6113.66 → 6116.78] No, but I don't think that's that unreasonable to be completely honest
[6116.78 → 6119.90] Really to make it so that you can't have double-spacing?
[6119.90 → 6120.54] Yeah, screw them
[6121.82 → 6122.78] I'm with Luke on this
[6122.78 → 6123.58] I mean, uh, okay
[6123.58 → 6124.38] I hate double-spacing too
[6124.38 → 6125.50] Double-spacing sucks
[6125.50 → 6126.38] It's so dumb
[6126.38 → 6129.58] And if they want it, if they want it, they could go change it on that document
[6129.58 → 6132.30] But we could change on an organizational level the defaults
[6134.70 → 6136.78] Are you a hundred percent sure that you can do that?
[6137.26 → 6137.50] I'm
[6139.42 → 6142.38] Genuinely like I'm going to say 92 and a half percent sure
[6143.26 → 6144.06] Hold on a second
[6144.06 → 6146.62] There's some pretty powerful things you can do in the Google admin
[6147.50 → 6149.18] All right, hold on a second
[6149.18 → 6151.26] Okay, bringing up my Google Docs here
[6151.26 → 6154.30] The thing the hills that we choose to die on is just
[6155.74 → 6156.30] magical
[6156.30 → 6157.50] You have to live a little sometimes
[6158.78 → 6159.34] It's uh
[6159.90 → 6160.54] It's true though
[6160.54 → 6161.90] This one's not doing it
[6161.90 → 6164.06] It must be something that other people do then
[6164.62 → 6165.10] Um
[6165.10 → 6166.70] Yeah, your employees are wrong
[6166.70 → 6167.26] But there was
[6167.26 → 6171.66] I swear to you guys
[6171.66 → 6173.18] Uh, you know what?
[6173.18 → 6175.18] No, I think we figured out what it was
[6175.18 → 6178.62] It was from someone pasting something into Google Docs
[6178.62 → 6180.78] To the point where even when we just paste without formatting
[6180.78 → 6181.18] Yeah
[6181.18 → 6182.06] Control shift v
[6182.06 → 6183.26] I didn't paste it
[6183.98 → 6184.54] Linus
[6184.54 → 6185.66] So to the point where
[6186.46 → 6189.26] To the point where even if we changed the uh
[6189.26 → 6191.02] So even if we went into format
[6191.02 → 6194.06] Uh line and paragraph spacing and changed everything
[6194.06 → 6197.82] It wasn't fixing that chunk of it or something like it was really annoying
[6197.82 → 6199.74] Alex figured it out after he left
[6199.74 → 6203.66] Um and messaged me, and I was like, oh, that's it. That's interesting. That's a solution
[6203.66 → 6204.46] But there
[6205.10 → 6207.98] There have been things that have been a little bit annoying
[6208.30 → 6213.18] I really don't like the way that Google Docs uh handles many comments on document
[6213.66 → 6216.46] But then I also hate the way that word does it now. So okay
[6216.46 → 6218.70] Cool
[6219.82 → 6223.82] Um, I don't have a lot of experience with words, but I notably dislike
[6224.46 → 6227.50] How Google Docs does it so like it takes up way too much space
[6227.50 → 6230.54] I need better density. There's a lot of wasted space
[6230.54 → 6237.02] I wish there was almost just like a view option. You know, they have like comfortable and compact. Yeah, let me have that view option for comments
[6237.34 → 6242.94] Yeah, microsoft Microsoft Word commenting has been a complete cluster for like the last few years
[6242.94 → 6247.74] It was perfect before, and now it takes that sort of collaborative cloud editing
[6248.46 → 6253.98] Approach even though I'm not collaborating and this is not in the cloud where you have to
[6253.98 → 6259.02] I think that's them trying to not have a huge amount of differentiation between standard word and SharePoint word
[6259.02 → 6262.62] I get it, but I don't want to I don't want to
[6263.50 → 6264.78] Close out
[6264.78 → 6266.38] Editing a comment
[6266.38 → 6271.18] Every time I want to just click away from it and start working on another comment and not have it tell me
[6271.18 → 6276.06] No, you can't work on this comment while you still have an open comment. That's utterly ridiculous. It's annoying. It makes absolutely no sense
[6276.06 → 6278.46] I didn't know that was even a thing, but that's annoying really frustrating
[6279.90 → 6281.90] That actually feels like
[6281.90 → 6283.90] very like old school
[6285.02 → 6290.94] Cloud collaborative not new school cloud collaborative. Yep new school would just leave it there, and you could come update it when you want
[6290.94 → 6294.14] Yep, no, it's its extremely frustrating. That's um
[6295.74 → 6299.58] Yeah, I mean I I am familiar with Google Docs
[6299.58 → 6302.94] I use it very regularly including writing scripts in it. Um
[6304.30 → 6305.66] I do find
[6307.42 → 6308.30] Sometimes it's uh
[6308.30 → 6313.66] It's little things like cursor and selection handling. I do like the way that word does it better
[6313.66 → 6317.18] It's not perfect. That might be just a matter of being a little bit more used to it
[6317.90 → 6319.90] um
[6322.14 → 6323.50] I got uh
[6323.50 → 6329.98] I won't say their name because I actually really like this person. I genuinely just think it's funny
[6330.22 → 6331.66] So I don't want to throw them under the bus
[6331.66 → 6332.54] I won't say their name
[6333.10 → 6337.74] um, but I asked for a SharePoint demo from a Microsoft rep that I know
[6338.38 → 6342.62] I was like hey like we're thinking about using this thing internally. Yeah, um, but like it takes some
[6343.02 → 6345.34] You know, like it set up on our side
[6345.34 → 6348.30] I really just want to like to let some people dip their toes in it
[6348.30 → 6351.74] I didn't say all this but I said can I get a demo?
[6351.98 → 6355.74] We want to see how it works before we like to do the work to set it up. Yeah
[6356.06 → 6358.06] Um, and he sent me a CD key
[6360.06 → 6361.82] And I was like what is this
[6363.02 → 6367.82] And I got roasted because I guess he thought I didn't know what a CD key was
[6368.94 → 6374.70] And I was like bro. No, I wanted a demo like I didn't want demo software demo desk. Yeah
[6375.34 → 6376.78] I wanted a demonstration
[6378.30 → 6390.38] I was like oh, all right, okay
[6391.42 → 6393.42] That's fine
[6393.74 → 6394.06] Okay
[6395.26 → 6396.14] Cool
[6396.14 → 6397.90] Dan what are we supposed to be doing right now?
[6397.90 → 6401.74] You have to answer the third merch message. Oh, okay. What was the question?
[6402.46 → 6404.62] Uh, I don't remember what the last one was
[6404.62 → 6408.62] Uh, hey LLD. I get to watch a birthday Sancho yay
[6409.34 → 6415.10] Happy birthday being the water cooling nut you are what do you think is missing from the water cooling
[6416.70 → 6419.74] Water cooling space that you would make to make it easier?
[6419.74 → 6422.30] Oh, that's a good question. I mean, okay
[6422.30 → 6427.18] Uh, this has been attempted time and time and time again
[6427.90 → 6433.58] And I think with additive manufacturing maybe we're finally going to get there pretty soon
[6434.22 → 6437.42] But do you remember um, do you remember DAC
[6438.22 → 6438.94] Unisyncs?
[6439.58 → 6440.62] Well, there's an uh
[6442.06 → 6442.54] Whoa
[6443.74 → 6444.78] Is this very old?
[6444.78 → 6445.34] Yeah
[6445.34 → 6446.78] I think so
[6446.78 → 6447.42] Yeah
[6448.30 → 6448.86] Uh
[6448.86 → 6452.86] Here we go. Let me see if I can let me see if I can find a picture in this article
[6453.58 → 6454.38] Uh, here we go
[6454.38 → 6460.22] By the way lots of feedback in the full-plane chat about how awful SharePoint is so sick. Yeah
[6460.86 → 6462.94] Maybe we'll maybe we'll just be going with Google Docs
[6462.94 → 6468.86] This is an unisync. Yeah, it's a heat sink designed to go onto your GPU
[6469.42 → 6475.18] Along with an um, I mean, this is not going to be great. Well, okay. No, we're not going to be able to zoom that far
[6475.18 → 6482.54] I'll there we go along with a GPU block that handles cooling the graphics processing unit itself
[6482.94 → 6486.86] Uh to handle the ram and arms and all of that good stuff
[6487.42 → 6489.98] Uh, let's go ahead and go to installation here
[6490.30 → 6497.82] So the finished installation should look a little something like this a block to handle the actual heat generating components
[6498.14 → 6500.14] And then a big
[6501.02 → 6506.14] Heat sink fin array that shouldn't need too much airflow over it in order to handle the rest now
[6506.14 → 6514.22] I think with modern DDR and I mean presumably whatever is coming after that it may be optimistic to handle those components with
[6515.26 → 6519.90] Basic heat sinks like that. So maybe a future like this will well
[6519.98 → 6525.02] Or maybe I shouldn't say a future like this maybe something like this will never be possible again in the future
[6525.42 → 6530.78] But I think it would be absolutely incredible if we could go back to
[6531.42 → 6532.62] non
[6532.62 → 6537.66] PCB specific GPU blocks and just use a standardized
[6538.38 → 6544.62] Block just like we do on CPUs with a hold down plate that you can swap out if you get a new GPU
[6545.10 → 6549.58] And then just uh, I don't know whether it's whether it's like, you know
[6549.58 → 6556.30] A company that designs these unisyncs these cooling these aluminum cooling plates
[6556.30 → 6559.58] Or you know whether they design them and stock them or whether they
[6560.22 → 6565.18] Measure everything and then you know, they just 3d print them out of you know aluminum on demand
[6565.18 → 6569.50] I'm not aware of anyone who's doing additive manufacturing with aluminum just yet
[6569.50 → 6574.22] But I know you can 3d print in some metals and then you just order one and they basically
[6574.22 → 6580.54] Print it kind of you know sand down the bottom so that it's flat and offers a good
[6580.78 → 6585.66] You know mounting surface and then you just get it in the mail or whatever it should be
[6585.98 → 6591.58] It should be theoretically a fraction of the cost of these all copper
[6592.14 → 6594.54] Machined from a giant hunk of metal
[6595.74 → 6598.30] Single GPU solutions that we have today
[6599.18 → 6605.02] And I would love to see that return because it's one of the things that makes water cooling so expensive a pump
[6605.42 → 6610.38] You can carry forward to multiple builds a reservoir you can carry forward for multiple builds
[6610.38 → 6617.50] I used my last d5 pump for over 10 years before it finally gave up the ghost and a reservoir if you maintain it properly
[6617.74 → 6620.14] There's no reason that you couldn't use it longer than that
[6620.14 → 6623.90] Especially if it's a good reservoir that uses o-ring seals rather than just
[6624.38 → 6625.10] um
[6625.10 → 6627.50] gluing together acrylic panels so
[6628.38 → 6634.86] CPU block unless you must have another degree off or two degrees off or whatever
[6635.26 → 6641.42] You could still be using a CPU block from 10 years ago nothing would prevent that the one piece that you have to spend
[6642.62 → 6643.90] 150 dollars on plus
[6644.62 → 6647.10] Every time is a GPU block
[6647.58 → 6655.18] So if you could just spend you know 70 80 bucks on one once and then every generation you spend 20 30 bucks on a new
[6655.58 → 6656.70] all-in-one heat sink
[6656.70 → 6658.62] I
[6658.62 → 6662.54] I could see it being more accessible because it's still a gigantic upfront investment
[6662.86 → 6669.18] But at least it's something where you are carrying forward the vast majority of these components as you continue to upgrade your system over the years
[6669.18 → 6672.38] So that that's something that I think I would change if I could
[6676.78 → 6680.46] Apparently there are some rocket and defence companies that are doing aluminum additive manufacturing
[6681.50 → 6686.54] Okay, so yeah, maybe we're maybe we're not that far off. That would be super cool
[6686.54 → 6687.42] Oh
[6687.42 → 6689.42] Is it time for me to pick a topic?
[6689.42 → 6689.82] Yes
[6689.82 → 6691.66] No, no
[6691.66 → 6692.78] No
[6692.78 → 6695.26] He almost got me
[6695.26 → 6696.30] No
[6696.30 → 6698.22] It's too quick
[6698.22 → 6698.70] Illegal
[6698.70 → 6700.30] Not allowed
[6700.30 → 6700.70] All right
[6700.70 → 6700.94] All right
[6701.98 → 6702.86] It's wing time
[6705.02 → 6705.74] I think you mean
[6706.78 → 6707.82] It's morphing time
[6710.62 → 6712.30] Dude that's so weird
[6712.94 → 6713.74] Okay, so here
[6714.54 → 6717.90] Why did they ever do this? I used to really like LG phones
[6721.58 → 6723.42] Okay, are you really not going to hold it up to the people?
[6724.30 → 6727.82] It doesn't have anything confidential on it right now. I guess it's signed in to my email
[6728.70 → 6731.02] That's a surprisingly smooth action
[6732.94 → 6735.90] You can just do it with one thumb like that. No problem. No, you can
[6736.78 → 6737.26] You can't?
[6737.90 → 6739.18] I have tiny hands loop
[6739.82 → 6740.14] Okay
[6742.06 → 6744.94] You can't just simulate having small hands. It's slippery
[6745.98 → 6749.26] Grab it with a couple pencils. It's extremely slippery
[6749.26 → 6758.14] It's also really heavy. Dan just keeps getting me today. It is fairly heavy, but my pixel pro is also pretty heavy
[6761.42 → 6763.74] I can't tell a big difference between them
[6764.86 → 6765.34] Show off
[6769.58 → 6775.26] Wasn't my point um, I was stunned at how heavy the pixel pro was pixelated pro was
[6775.26 → 6777.26] Hmm
[6782.06 → 6787.02] For me, it's less about the heaviness and less about the ease of flipping the thing
[6787.02 → 6790.06] It's just more about why what the f would I ever do with this?
[6791.34 → 6794.30] And they provide a little there's like a little tutorial actually playing right now
[6794.30 → 6797.90] Make sure you don't swipe that away so that I can kind of capture it. Yeah, yeah, sort of
[6798.46 → 6802.30] Introducing swivel home software that definitely was worth developing
[6802.30 → 6804.30] Um
[6806.14 → 6811.34] Someone's actual job like someone's actual life force was consumed to create this at the same time
[6811.34 → 6814.30] This is why I wish LG was still making phones because like
[6815.18 → 6817.18] It feels well-made
[6817.90 → 6819.90] And it works
[6821.50 → 6823.66] Yeah, like that's kind of crazy
[6824.46 → 6826.46] Whether they sell like 50 of these
[6826.46 → 6827.34] Something like
[6829.18 → 6834.06] And they went through the engineering of making it feel like an actual like very solid real product
[6834.06 → 6837.34] Yeah, the fact that this made it past
[6838.14 → 6841.02] Creating a functional prototype and going is insane
[6841.58 → 6844.30] It's kind of mind-blowing probably why they're not in phones anymore
[6844.94 → 6850.06] But like they made good phones. They actually did a good job of making the phone. Yeah, I just don't
[6851.18 → 6852.78] The business guidance was a little
[6852.78 → 6858.30] Questionable. I can't believe that this thing is still getting software updates
[6859.10 → 6864.38] Yeah, like that's why I didn't think they were going to be able to get me to use it because you have to do it like that
[6864.38 → 6866.38] You can't do are you sure?
[6866.38 → 6868.38] Look it, so the problem is that
[6868.46 → 6871.42] It's hard for me to hold on to this without slipping on it
[6872.54 → 6878.94] When I am when I'm like yeah, I can, but it's hard to it's hard to reach up
[6878.94 → 6880.94] I'm going to get up high and up
[6881.66 → 6882.06] Dang it
[6882.86 → 6887.82] Oh the gesture controls also on a phone with basically no chin bezel
[6888.38 → 6890.94] Getting all the way down there is like killing me. I need buttons
[6891.34 → 6895.10] So what happens is I don't know maybe part of it is just the way that I hold phones
[6895.10 → 6897.02] But this is sliding on my pinky right now
[6897.50 → 6900.38] So it's hard for me to push the front screen
[6901.10 → 6902.94] Without it interfering there
[6903.66 → 6908.06] And like yeah, I can, I could get it see it really quick. I want to see how I do it
[6908.06 → 6912.54] I have a have a question. Does it open the other direction? No. Oh, yeah, I'm left-handed
[6912.54 → 6915.58] I don't I could not use this phone you go like this, right?
[6916.54 → 6919.10] Uh, yeah, you do pinky under yeah, I do pinky to the side
[6919.98 → 6921.98] Okay, so
[6923.42 → 6925.42] Pinky to the side
[6925.42 → 6929.34] Well, how do you how do you how do you touch the bottom of your screen?
[6930.14 → 6933.90] Because I can't, I can't touch them. I can't touch the bottom of my screen like that
[6934.94 → 6937.42] So yeah, I think I must just have a different
[6938.14 → 6941.42] Ergonomic start. Yeah, no, there's no way I could reach that
[6942.14 → 6944.14] Like not even close. Oh
[6946.30 → 6949.82] Yeah, like that's as close as I can get to the bottom of my screen with my pinky here
[6950.46 → 6953.50] So I have to hold it at the bottom so I can get my hand lower
[6953.50 → 6956.78] And that's the only way that I can get
[6957.66 → 6963.90] Almost all the way across to the icon on the far left side. I'm just getting rid of my notifications. Yeah, so I can do that
[6963.90 → 6965.90] Yeah, like that's so, so small
[6966.54 → 6969.66] I didn't actually realize that was like I can do this one-handed is
[6970.30 → 6972.70] But it's like yeah putting it back feels like a
[6973.58 → 6977.82] Like a high-risk manoeuvre. Yeah. Um, yeah anyway, I promised
[6979.42 → 6982.78] Here on the show I would do the official sim swap
[6983.50 → 6990.46] I was fidgeting with my sim tool earlier. It's lucky. I'm able to find it now. All right. Out it comes. Oh
[6991.82 → 6993.26] rip uh
[6993.26 → 6995.26] rip SD card
[6995.50 → 6997.50] Man gotta love those note 9 things
[6998.94 → 7000.46] Best phone
[7000.46 → 7005.18] Actually the best phone. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, do you want to see something wild?
[7005.18 → 7006.38] Yes
[7006.38 → 7007.18] Oh
[7007.18 → 7009.18] Oh, oh my god
[7009.18 → 7010.22] Oh my god
[7010.22 → 7012.62] It's watching of you when you have it like this
[7013.10 → 7018.54] Okay, you either need to enter your pin here or you can unlock with your fingerprint
[7018.54 → 7022.54] Oh
[7022.54 → 7024.54] Oh
[7026.46 → 7027.90] That's so goofy
[7028.94 → 7033.10] Just put it on the back of the phone. That's that's my biggest gripe with this actually
[7033.66 → 7038.14] Um is that the the the there's no like I got so used to my previous pixel
[7038.62 → 7043.10] Where unlocking and also okay my biggest my absolute biggest gripe
[7043.66 → 7048.06] Out of everything with this phone was with my previous phone you could swipe down
[7048.86 → 7052.46] On the fingerprint reader on the back, and it would pull down your menu from the top
[7053.66 → 7058.30] So you didn't have to adjust your hand at all you just go poop, and now I can't do that
[7058.30 → 7061.18] Yeah, you can uh pull down the menu from
[7061.98 → 7063.98] Like not being on a particular
[7064.30 → 7069.58] I don't really want to show my screen. It's something that google doesn't do a great job of it's just sort of continuity of features
[7070.06 → 7076.46] Yeah across their product line like that within the first day of using it. I like hated it because it didn't have that feature
[7076.46 → 7078.46] Yeah, and now it's I
[7078.54 → 7080.22] would say it's
[7080.22 → 7084.38] Acceptable just because it isn't just because it isn't this and or that
[7085.34 → 7087.66] Like I'm holding this phone
[7088.54 → 7090.54] What exactly?
[7091.26 → 7093.26] Utility
[7093.42 → 7099.34] Carousel up here a small toy. What did I even oh wow this is hilarious video? This is a gimbals mode
[7099.34 → 7105.26] So you can record your video at a know fraction of the quality
[7105.90 → 7109.18] Why pan around inside it is with digital zoom?
[7110.14 → 7112.78] Because you're a big dumb idiot. I guess is a
[7113.42 → 7117.18] Reason that I could think of for that, but that's not actually what I wanted to show you
[7117.74 → 7119.26] uh, what I wanted to show you
[7119.98 → 7121.98] was
[7122.30 → 7124.54] This
[7124.54 → 7126.54] Um
[7126.54 → 7128.54] What why is
[7128.94 → 7131.74] Why is anything that I'm looking at happening right now?
[7132.70 → 7138.94] Where's just regular old camera mode? That's a good sign. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay, are you ready? Yeah
[7140.06 → 7142.22] Whoa, pop-up camera!
[7142.22 → 7147.98] I forgot that this phone had a pop-up camera like the one plus whatever the crap it was pop-up headlights dude. Love it
[7148.62 → 7157.34] Wow, so it has um, yeah, because it's, that's one thing I do like about it is that it's all screen all the time
[7158.06 → 7160.06] tiny forehead bar
[7160.06 → 7162.06] tiny chin bar
[7162.06 → 7168.38] Just actually all screen baby. I was wondering what that slot out at the top was earlier actually
[7168.70 → 7173.02] Slot out like the the the up here where the camera comes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[7173.18 → 7175.18] Yeah, I don't know what to call it, but yeah
[7175.18 → 7178.46] Um door I go sure I don't know okay
[7180.30 → 7181.42] Let's go ahead and put it in
[7182.46 → 7187.74] No way it does have a micro SD slot. I Larry I would love
[7188.86 → 7193.90] Love if this story ended with you being like I think it's pretty cool after using it for a while. Luke
[7193.90 → 7195.90] I don't think it's going to
[7196.70 → 7202.78] Even it would be so cool even just picking the stupid thing up off the desk like I'll go to I'll I'll go to
[7203.34 → 7206.46] Particularly with my left hand I'll go to grab it and like it'll slide
[7207.18 → 7213.58] It'll slide apart a little bit because in order to have the hinge be loose enough that you can easily activate it
[7213.58 → 7218.38] It also just is like kind of all over the place like it's
[7221.82 → 7224.38] Yeah, it's an absolute joke
[7225.42 → 7228.78] I'm not even going to bother putting my SD card in here. I don't have anything on it anyway. I never use it
[7228.78 → 7233.98] Which is a cool feature, and you wanted to use it yeah, it's just I'm yeah
[7233.98 → 7239.42] I'm going to get the full value out of my phone. Yeah, I'm more glad that if you know has it or whatever. Yeah, for sure
[7239.42 → 7240.30] uh, but
[7241.34 → 7245.58] I I I got some intel from a phone menu from someone
[7245.58 → 7249.82] I actually trust at a phone manufacturer, and he's like honestly the reason that it's gone is not because
[7250.54 → 7254.62] Like that space mattered or because like people like hated users
[7255.18 → 7259.74] A big part of the reason that it's gone is that micro SD cards tend to be the cheapest crappiest and
[7260.22 → 7264.06] Tend to be very unreliable, and they break people can be mad at the phone
[7264.94 → 7266.94] Yeah, that makes sense. Um
[7266.94 → 7268.70] And so he was like yeah
[7268.70 → 7271.26] It's one of those things where the vast majority of users
[7271.90 → 7274.94] Are like are chill and understand but for the rest of them
[7275.90 → 7281.50] Why are we doing this we're creating extra tech support and extra negative brand perception for what yep?
[7281.90 → 7287.18] Um, so that we cannot sell phones that are more expensive because they have more internal storage like this is
[7287.42 → 7289.58] This is actually harmful in every way
[7289.90 → 7292.86] But that makes me not blame them at all because I totally get it
[7292.86 → 7299.26] But it's just frustrating that that's the reality that sucks. Yeah, I don't think that that is the same
[7299.58 → 7303.18] Excuse or I don't think that's the same reason the headphone jack is ultimately gone
[7303.82 → 7305.82] Um, that just seems to be
[7306.94 → 7311.02] You can change the back to double tap to open notifications. What?
[7312.22 → 7315.02] What part of it just you just tap the back of it
[7317.10 → 7319.10] How do you even do that?
[7322.70 → 7327.02] I actually tried to look for this because I saw I noticed that the g
[7328.38 → 7330.38] Is like a different texture
[7330.38 → 7334.14] It's partially mirrored, and I was like that could actually be a touch thingy
[7335.82 → 7336.38] Gestures
[7337.26 → 7343.10] Yeah, like right now if I tap it nothing happens. There's no indication that anything could happen. Nothing's going on
[7344.06 → 7347.82] So, how do I even find gestures now? Everyone's going to see how dumb I am with phones
[7347.82 → 7353.18] Okay, I just had to add some notes to my wing to my wing review
[7353.50 → 7356.62] Like using the fingerprint sensor in wing mode is hilarious
[7360.06 → 7360.54] What's up?
[7360.54 → 7364.30] Oh, no, my system is four days out of date
[7366.62 → 7371.50] Nice, I'm still getting software updates loop. It's actually crazy that it can be even four days
[7371.50 → 7374.06] Install update to keep device secure install now
[7374.62 → 7377.58] Installing a security update. Oh, wow. This is a T-Mobile update
[7378.62 → 7381.42] What I don't see mobile our customers' privacy whatever
[7381.98 → 7385.34] Okay, well sure. I mean that's not a T-Mobile sim. You know what?
[7385.34 → 7390.38] I don't actually know if this thing works on my carrier or in my region
[7391.66 → 7394.38] Welcome to the new video calling dialler
[7395.58 → 7402.78] Support.t-mobile.com. I mean, I'm not on T-Mobile. So lets uh, let's see. I'm going to call Luke Laredo here. Oh, no
[7403.74 → 7404.86] Oh gross
[7405.42 → 7412.78] Okay, so one of my favourite features as I think many of you will know is t9 dialling. So instead of me
[7413.58 → 7418.86] Bringing up a like a text search box and then typing with a keyboard
[7419.26 → 7424.22] I can just press 5 8 5 3 and that will bring up
[7424.94 → 7432.30] Luke Laredo and on my Samsung phone they support uh swipe right to call swipe left to text
[7432.78 → 7435.50] So I'll just go 5 8 5 3
[7436.22 → 7437.50] swipe right and
[7437.50 → 7441.82] I can call Luke and like actually under a second
[7442.38 → 7444.38] um
[7444.38 → 7449.18] On this one you click the name, and then it finished it completes
[7449.90 → 7452.86] Filling in the phone number. So then you still have to
[7453.42 → 7458.38] Go press call. Yeah, one more interaction, which is basically my kryptonite
[7459.18 → 7465.26] I hate unnecessary interactions and interfaces. They are terrible. I knew that about you very quickly when like one of the first
[7465.26 → 7470.94] Few days we worked together you went on this huge rant about the internal software at CX because they like added a button click
[7471.58 → 7473.58] You're like, how could you possibly do this?
[7473.90 → 7475.98] Well, it didn't serve any function
[7475.98 → 7476.78] No, I remember
[7476.78 → 7482.38] It didn't do anything other than just be and it's madder at the time
[7482.78 → 7488.54] No, it's more than just the button click. It's the fact that there was a slow loading time
[7489.10 → 7493.34] associated with the extra button press, and it was one that I had to press
[7493.82 → 7495.66] f***ING a hundred times a day
[7496.22 → 7504.30] Yeah, actual notable productivity and the people who spec the change never use these tools they touch it once a day just
[7505.10 → 7506.94] They don't actually work with it. They just
[7508.14 → 7512.46] Watch other people work with it, and so they didn't understand what they were changing
[7513.02 → 7517.42] So it was stupid. Yeah, that was my problem, and it did nothing
[7518.54 → 7526.46] I have bad things to say about the back button thing first on my previous pixel. It was slightly indented
[7527.58 → 7529.58] So you could find it
[7529.82 → 7533.26] With your finger without looking considering it's on the back of the phone
[7534.14 → 7537.34] This has nothing to it. You can bear I can
[7538.38 → 7542.94] Sort of maybe tell that it's there because there's like slightly more grip for a second
[7543.74 → 7548.06] But it's really hard to tell also before all I had to do was slide my finger down
[7548.06 → 7552.54] Like that very natural to bring down a tray you pull down now
[7552.54 → 7556.06] I have to tap twice on something that I don't know where it is
[7556.38 → 7557.50] So I'm just going like duh
[7558.14 → 7561.50] I can't find I genuinely I'm genuinely trying now
[7562.30 → 7564.54] Genuinely I still haven't got it. Where is it?
[7565.58 → 7567.58] Okay, now I got a feel
[7567.98 → 7569.98] I feel there it is
[7570.62 → 7572.86] That's not working. There we go. I got it like what?
[7573.58 → 7577.10] No internet no phone calls. I might have to do some stupid
[7577.50 → 7578.70] Jigger
[7578.70 → 7584.38] I hope it supports my bands here because I really want to use this phone for a month. Just tap anywhere
[7584.38 → 7586.86] Okay, if it's just tap anywhere then it's horrible
[7588.22 → 7591.10] It sounds like the sounds like the kick sensor on the trunk of my car
[7591.10 → 7596.78] Theory dude, you just have to like to bash it. Oh, oh, okay. You can't
[7597.50 → 7600.06] No, that's also not working. Hey, Dan
[7601.98 → 7604.78] This is bad. You're on the clock. Hey
[7605.90 → 7610.14] Yes, yes, uh, what are the odds that you want to set up my um
[7611.18 → 7616.78] My stupid APN settings and stuff. Yeah, sure. Okay, that seems like a thing Dan could do
[7616.78 → 7622.46] I um, say I have a lot of practice because I buy Chinese phones, and they don't necessarily work in Canada
[7622.62 → 7624.54] Okay, and it drives me mental. Um, cool
[7625.10 → 7629.50] Because I don't want to do it. I can do it, but I have to like to learn how to do it every time
[7629.50 → 7631.98] It's one of those things where I only do it once every like two years
[7632.70 → 7638.38] There's no sensor on the back of the phone. It's an accelerometer. Oh, shut up. That's what that's what chat's saying
[7638.94 → 7640.94] Apparently you just actually have to bash it
[7640.94 → 7648.38] That's so much worse and now because of that I feel like it's just going to open when I don't want it to all the time
[7648.46 → 7653.26] Awesome, so I'm just going to end up turning it off anyway. Hey, Robin C. Just bought a luxe backpack. Hey
[7654.06 → 7661.26] Joining the crew luck backpack crew. Let's go. Do we have reviews for those yet? No, we haven't shipped any out yet. Oh, right
[7661.26 → 7665.74] It's like a pre-sale basically. Yeah, I mean it's the same backpack, but in a different material
[7665.74 → 7667.98] So we were we decided we were okay with its fair enough
[7667.98 → 7670.70] Okay, what are we supposed to be doing right now?
[7671.42 → 7677.18] Topics. Oh, topics you got a half hour till that I want to talk about Activision confidential arms deal
[7677.42 → 7685.50] Yeah, according to the Wall Street journal Activision made a secret deal with arms maker Remington to feature its adaptive combat rifle in
[7686.06 → 7688.06] 2009's Call of Duty modern warfare 2
[7688.78 → 7693.58] No money was exchanged, but both parties agreed to keep the deal confidential
[7694.22 → 7697.02] So why do we know well the deals that well
[7697.02 → 7704.70] The details of the deal were outlined in internal Remington documents that were uncovered during a lawsuit that was filed by parents of victims of the Sandy Hook
[7704.78 → 7706.86] elementary school shooting in 2012
[7707.66 → 7710.94] Remington settled that suit last year for 73 million dollars
[7711.42 → 7718.94] These documents outline a strategy on the part of Remington to increase its appeal with younger audiences
[7718.94 → 7724.94] This is a quote with increasing urbanization and access to shooting and hunting areas in decline
[7725.42 → 7732.06] A primary means for young potential shooters to come into contact with firearms and ammunition is through virtual gaming scenarios
[7732.30 → 7736.46] That is the most corps speak way of describing games have guns in them
[7736.46 → 7738.30] Yeah, that I think I've ever heard. Yeah
[7738.30 → 7745.74] One memo noted that while the company would not allow branded weapons in games where players can shoot at non-military bad guys
[7746.22 → 7751.18] It wouldn't oppose replicas of its guns in those games because and this is a quote
[7751.58 → 7755.34] Previous experience tells us people will seek out the brands of the guns
[7755.82 → 7763.50] A lack of direct branding helps to shield us from implications of a direct endorsement while still receiving benefit from inclusion in the game
[7764.30 → 7770.30] So we have some discussion questions here, but the thing that I really wanted to talk about is in this case
[7771.50 → 7773.50] no money changed hands and
[7775.02 → 7776.14] um
[7776.14 → 7783.90] You know, it's yeah, no money changed hands. So I would say that it's not the same as other product placements
[7784.70 → 7787.90] But the fact that it could go completely undisclosed
[7788.54 → 7791.34] raises a lot of questions for me about
[7791.34 → 7795.10] I don't know everything I see in a video game
[7795.90 → 7801.02] Because certain types of advertising are actually reasonably well regulated
[7801.50 → 7805.02] like influencer product endorsements for example now are
[7805.90 → 7812.22] At least from a rules' standpoint very well laid out. You can't say anything you don't actually believe
[7812.22 → 7815.66] So you can't disguise advertising talking points as personal opinion
[7815.66 → 7819.50] uh, you can't disguise paid content as
[7819.50 → 7820.38] um
[7820.38 → 7826.14] Organic content um there you have to disclose in ways x y and z at least
[7827.02 → 7830.94] Y amount earlier in the content and there's all these there's all these rules around it
[7831.50 → 7837.98] but it seems like somehow whether we're talking about uh movies or TV or video games
[7837.98 → 7843.50] product placements don't seem to have any of the same kinds of
[7844.54 → 7845.58] guidelines
[7845.58 → 7847.10] yeah and sometimes
[7848.14 → 7849.74] like in this case I'm sitting here thinking
[7850.38 → 7851.34] i don't know
[7851.34 → 7853.34] like we have LG laptops
[7853.34 → 7855.26] what about this jerky that we could eat
[7856.38 → 7858.38] but that was just that was disclosed that was yeah
[7858.38 → 7858.62] sorry
[7858.62 → 7860.14] we have LG laptops
[7860.14 → 7860.46] yeah
[7860.46 → 7862.22] Your LG logo is viewable
[7862.78 → 7863.26] Is it?
[7863.26 → 7865.26] Probably not the most easily
[7865.26 → 7866.86] I mean I have oh, oh it verified
[7866.86 → 7868.38] I put a verified sticker next to it
[7868.38 → 7870.30] Right before it but not on top of it
[7870.30 → 7871.90] So you can see that you have a LG laptop
[7871.90 → 7874.14] Now if you had a discussion with LG
[7874.78 → 7876.30] and were like can we call these
[7876.94 → 7878.70] LG laptops instead of
[7881.18 → 7882.54] UP laptops
[7882.54 → 7883.34] And they were like
[7884.14 → 7884.46] sure
[7885.18 → 7886.86] And then you never talked about it
[7886.86 → 7890.78] Yeah, I mean I guess that's
[7890.78 → 7892.14] No money exchanged hands
[7892.78 → 7893.10] Yeah
[7893.10 → 7894.78] And like it's a game with firearms
[7896.62 → 7898.62] So they like I don't know
[7898.62 → 7901.42] But a clear benefit took place
[7901.42 → 7903.90] For sure and a clear benefit is happening for LG
[7903.90 → 7905.82] So for you having a LG laptop on your desk
[7905.82 → 7907.90] Well, there's no benefit to me in this case
[7907.90 → 7910.46] But in the case of the Activision
[7911.02 → 7911.82] um
[7911.82 → 7914.22] Remington deal there's a clear benefit to both sides
[7914.22 → 7917.98] Especially in modern gaming where they're going to sell skins on these guns
[7918.54 → 7922.62] So we're not talking about like an insignificant people are going to be way more interested
[7923.10 → 7925.74] In an officially licensed you know like
[7926.30 → 7927.50] Like that's properly modelled
[7928.14 → 7933.02] Almost every gun that has a sorry almost every game that has a Glock in it
[7933.42 → 7937.82] Sure just calls them like a something ever so slightly different, but it's
[7938.54 → 7939.74] obviously a Glock
[7939.74 → 7944.14] And they sell a ton of skins
[7945.02 → 7946.38] Because everyone knows anyway
[7946.38 → 7948.38] I guess that's true
[7949.10 → 7951.26] But then I'm thinking of uh like okay
[7952.38 → 7956.86] Uh, you know thinking about like a game like world of tanks where one of their sticks
[7956.86 → 7963.42] Is the super accurate modelling of of the ex that exact you know model of tank or whatever else
[7963.42 → 7968.54] So I see your point, but I also do think there's a clear value to accurately modelled
[7969.18 → 7971.18] weapons and vehicles
[7972.14 → 7972.38] So
[7973.58 → 7974.06] You know what?
[7974.06 → 7975.98] I don't think you're completely wrong
[7976.94 → 7979.10] I feel like we're running into a handshake moment
[7979.10 → 7981.10] Yeah
[7981.74 → 7985.02] I I I I definitely understand both points. I don't think it's
[7985.74 → 7992.86] Completely I think the value is very unclear, but it's not measurable. Yeah, but it's its like an intrinsic
[7992.86 → 7998.38] Yeah, it's an intrinsic value. I think there is value like I know that I know that the relationship between
[7999.18 → 8001.18] racing game
[8001.18 → 8003.82] developers and car manufacturers is
[8004.30 → 8008.94] Complicated in much the same way where some of them there's deep cooperation
[8009.82 → 8011.82] And in others you end up with this sort of
[8012.70 → 8013.58] unlicensed
[8013.58 → 8014.62] lookalikes
[8014.62 → 8020.94] And for I and that's a space where I can tell you 100% that there is a strong
[8021.02 → 8022.70] preference from gamers
[8023.10 → 8028.22] For the cars to be authentic that one. I do know and handle in an authentic way. Yeah, for sure
[8028.70 → 8031.02] That that one is very true. I don't know
[8032.30 → 8033.50] I know people okay
[8033.58 → 8038.94] Here's an example of a company that just has never cared at all as far as I can tell and just did it anyway
[8038.94 → 8043.82] I don't know friend, but no Markov. Yeah, isn't that battle or battle state. Yeah. Yeah, sorry
[8045.66 → 8048.30] Yeah, I meant to say battle state. Yeah, but they're in Russia
[8048.94 → 8056.54] Who's going to enforce it and I do think that community sees some benefit, but honestly oh that community 100%
[8057.18 → 8061.34] I don't think it's talked about that much that the brand is correct. I do
[8062.06 → 8068.78] Well that the characteristics are modelling and the characteristics being correct is very important and hotly debated
[8068.94 → 8070.94] Um
[8071.66 → 8073.66] If it was a
[8073.66 → 8079.34] Smock instead of a block, I don't think people would care. No people would be mad about that
[8080.22 → 8082.22] It's a stupid
[8082.94 → 8084.94] Smock
[8084.94 → 8086.94] um
[8086.94 → 8088.94] I don't know
[8091.10 → 8093.26] Yeah, anyway, there's definitely value sure
[8094.38 → 8097.98] I just I just wanna I guess what I'm I guess what I'm
[8097.98 → 8099.98] I guess what I want
[8100.06 → 8102.06] is
[8102.06 → 8104.94] More clear disclosures around product placement
[8105.66 → 8106.06] or
[8106.06 → 8107.26] I
[8107.26 → 8110.46] Want our team to sell way more product placements
[8111.98 → 8112.70] Because if I
[8112.70 → 8117.82] Because if we could just take money from everyone and not have to disclose any of it then sure that sounds great
[8119.66 → 8121.66] Guys chill
[8121.66 → 8123.58] What I find we disclose things, okay?
[8123.58 → 8125.58] I just mean it's uh
[8125.58 → 8127.26] It just seems like
[8128.22 → 8128.94] Okay, fine
[8128.94 → 8129.42] I
[8129.42 → 8130.70] I wish it could be this way
[8130.70 → 8134.30] But if it's not going to be this way then I should at least be I should at least be getting paid too
[8135.02 → 8136.94] By the way, no, uh, the answer is no
[8137.18 → 8138.78] LG does not pay for this placement
[8138.78 → 8141.66] The reason these are here is that nobody wanted to use them internally
[8142.78 → 8147.18] Which is ironic because they're grams and the main point of them is that they're super light
[8147.18 → 8151.10] And they never get here and never move, and they sit here and never move yeah, um
[8151.18 → 8154.86] The gram was a really, really great concept when it first came out
[8155.10 → 8159.90] And then I feel like just over time they iterated and iterated, and it got like a little bit better
[8160.06 → 8162.06] And then everyone else kind of caught up
[8162.22 → 8164.22] Not gonna lie
[8165.02 → 8167.02] This thing
[8167.58 → 8172.62] Is way less stupid than I initially thought this like all screen fold Majid
[8172.62 → 8174.78] You saw me using it in the meeting the other day, right?
[8175.90 → 8178.54] Oh, yeah, wait, it looks different though. Yeah
[8179.42 → 8186.70] Looked like it had a way bigger screen. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I see what happens. Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, I understand. It's pretty cool
[8187.50 → 8190.06] I uh, I was expecting to kind of dunk on it
[8191.50 → 8194.30] Deep this might happen with the wig. This might happen with the wig
[8195.10 → 8199.26] We can believe it's uh, it's not booting. We can, it's not booting
[8199.26 → 8202.30] All right, maybe not it just
[8205.02 → 8208.38] Oh, wait, it's booted. Oh, it's been saying there for like three minutes
[8210.46 → 8213.02] The screen also just goes sometimes black though. Oh
[8214.70 → 8218.54] No, it just does like I'll like I'll, I'll unlock it with my fingerprint
[8218.54 → 8225.74] It'll just like go black for like three seconds. No, we're saying T-Mobile for like ages. Oh, nice. Uh, I need you to unlock it again. Uh, okay
[8225.74 → 8227.74] Okay
[8229.02 → 8231.34] Nintendo says no fun
[8232.54 → 8238.14] Again, very cool. Nintendo has released strict new guidelines for community tournaments
[8238.46 → 8243.74] Which is to say uh tournaments without an official license from Nintendo
[8244.46 → 8250.54] Highlights from the new guidelines include that tournaments must be run at or below cost
[8250.54 → 8254.94] That organizers must publicly disclose costs and revenue
[8254.94 → 8257.02] That there may not be any sponsors
[8257.50 → 8260.22] Any selling of food drinks or merch?
[8260.70 → 8264.14] There may not be spectator fees for online tournaments
[8264.46 → 8269.10] There must be a cap of 200 participants in person or 300 online
[8269.50 → 8274.86] There should be no prizes exceeding a market value of 5 000 euros total
[8274.86 → 8279.90] And those are the ones in the dock, but I remember there being a couple of others that just felt
[8281.02 → 8282.14] utterly
[8282.14 → 8285.50] Ridiculous, um, hold on. Where's the where's the dock?
[8286.38 → 8290.06] Uh blah blah blah. Okay. Here's the here's the Nintendo. I don't know
[8290.94 → 8297.74] Oops. Well, whatever. Uh, the point is that they have must have reached the legal age of majority
[8298.62 → 8299.58] um
[8299.58 → 8303.66] May not the oh they oh, I remember one of them was that they capped here we go
[8303.66 → 8305.90] Here we go for in-person community tournaments
[8306.30 → 8311.90] Uh organizers that have reached the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction may collect an admission fee from spectators
[8311.90 → 8316.62] Of not more than the equivalent of 14 pounds or 15 pounds per person
[8317.10 → 8319.10] Which one is it? I don't know. I guess
[8319.74 → 8325.98] Based on how restrictive the rest of this is I would err on the side of caution and go with 14. Yeah, um
[8327.26 → 8328.70] What is a community tournament?
[8329.82 → 8333.50] A community tournament must meet the following requirements Nintendo's copy
[8333.66 → 8336.06] Rated games will be used in the tournament Nintendo
[8337.34 → 8343.02] That is actually not how this works. Yeah, I don't think this should be legal at all and I'm actually pissed off
[8343.34 → 8344.46] um, the so
[8345.42 → 8349.02] The smash community is such an incredibly dedicated
[8350.14 → 8352.62] surprisingly small group of people
[8353.26 → 8359.82] I've been like vaguely paying attention to it for quite a few years now just because it's like fascinating to me that it still survives
[8360.38 → 8363.50] Despite all of these constant attacks from Nintendo
[8363.50 → 8368.46] I was in like the star craft scene for a while. My brother was a caster. I really enjoyed playing
[8368.46 → 8370.62] I watched a lot of the professional games
[8371.18 → 8372.38] um
[8372.38 → 8373.66] And it was fascinating how
[8374.62 → 8378.86] Robust of like infrastructure and community was formed around this game that had
[8379.50 → 8383.50] Zero support from blizzard oftentimes blizzard being antagonistic
[8383.50 → 8389.02] Yeah, and then I have since been out of the star craft scene, and it's been interesting watching
[8389.50 → 8397.34] The smash scene because I see a lot of similarities, but it's way worse because Nintendo is not just like mildly antagonistic. They are
[8397.90 → 8399.58] very antagonistic like
[8400.62 → 8402.78] What are you even saying with all this?
[8402.78 → 8403.26] First
[8403.26 → 8407.02] I don't think it should be legal for a company to even do this and then second of all like
[8407.02 → 8411.42] Screw off dude people want to play your game and have fun around it
[8412.30 → 8416.54] Let them do it and if some people make a bit of money who cares
[8417.42 → 8418.30] Calm down
[8418.94 → 8421.34] It's actually okay. That should be a good thing
[8422.62 → 8424.62] What do you mean?
[8424.78 → 8427.74] Like what if it builds up a grassroots scene?
[8428.46 → 8433.58] And you can ultimately turn it into like a bigger thing or something at some point
[8433.58 → 8437.58] Like how could how are you how are you so short-sighted here?
[8438.94 → 8441.82] And like okay, yeah, we get it people are talking about it's not copyright
[8441.82 → 8444.06] It's that you own a license of the game, but not actually the game
[8445.90 → 8447.02] So
[8447.02 → 8454.54] What the difference between if everyone owns a license of a game the fact that someone can come in and dictate how
[8455.66 → 8459.10] How many of us can be in one place and play it?
[8459.58 → 8461.58] That's absurd. That should be illegal. It is
[8461.58 → 8466.06] It actually should not be able to do this as a company makes no sense. It's completely BS. You know what?
[8466.62 → 8468.62] You know what Luke
[8468.62 → 8471.26] Are you hosting a smash tournament? We're hosting a smash tournament. Let's go
[8473.02 → 8480.38] Okay, sick when we have when we have the land centre open. Yeah, we will host a 201-person smash tournament
[8481.50 → 8485.66] I will break as many of these guidelines as humanly possible
[8485.66 → 8490.62] I'm pretty sure I know people that would cast it and I challenge Nintendo to come after me. Okay
[8490.62 → 8496.78] Okay, fuck you. Do you want it cast it? I don't yeah, of course. I'll work on it like I just
[8498.30 → 8500.30] There is absolutely
[8500.30 → 8502.30] No feasible way
[8502.30 → 8505.98] There is no possible way this makes no sense
[8506.54 → 8513.82] Like listen to this listen to this you can't have a tournament in which participants are paid a performance fee or other expenses
[8513.82 → 8519.98] I can't, I can't pay someone I can't be like yeah, why not? Yeah, you can have some food
[8520.38 → 8523.82] Why do you insist who cares people want to?
[8524.38 → 8527.98] Why do you insist that people that want to professionally play your game have to like be poor?
[8528.94 → 8531.34] That's what you're doing like stupid
[8531.90 → 8535.90] The tournaments cannot receive goods or money from third parties such as sponsors
[8535.90 → 8541.98] How is it any business of yours if I have a sponsor for my event?
[8543.82 → 8550.06] I will have sponsors. I promise you that and you I promise you want the event host to make money
[8550.54 → 8553.74] Because if they make money, they're going to keep trying to do this thing
[8554.54 → 8556.54] And you should want them to do this thing
[8556.54 → 8565.82] Like all the right incentives are there some things make sense look you can't use the Nintendo sure logo sure to promote your tournament
[8565.82 → 8567.90] No problem. Yeah, that's your trademark
[8568.06 → 8573.50] Even if you didn't want them to use like the smash brothers logo or honestly even the name of the game. Yeah, who cares?
[8573.50 → 8580.46] You can't put Mario all you can't draw your own Mario and put it all over your website because it makes it seem Nintendo sanctioned
[8580.46 → 8583.82] No problem. Some things make sense, but some of them are
[8583.82 → 8592.06] Absolutely ridiculous. Oh, man. Oh, man. The part. Oh, they have in their Q&A. They have stuff about like school tournaments
[8592.06 → 8594.54] Yeah, but no one who doesn't go to the school can participate
[8594.86 → 8595.90] off
[8595.90 → 8596.94] Who cares?
[8596.94 → 8599.10] Why can't it be two different schools going against each other?
[8599.10 → 8607.02] Why can't I go to the school and have my friend come? Yeah, who cares? Yeah, it doesn't matter none of this is enforceable
[8607.66 → 8609.66] Like you can
[8609.66 → 8613.50] Write this thing all you want. Like what are you what are you going to do? You can ban me from
[8613.82 → 8615.82] Smash
[8616.54 → 8618.54] What are you even talking about?
[8620.62 → 8622.62] What gives you the right?
[8623.82 → 8632.06] What is up with this company? I don't get it super bullshit. Uh, I mean me gore asks can we get you see you as a sponsor?
[8633.98 → 8635.98] Yeah, they make an emulator
[8635.98 → 8638.78] I don't think they have money to spend but like rough
[8639.50 → 8641.50] Yeah, as long as they do a dollar
[8642.70 → 8643.10] um
[8644.06 → 8645.90] That would actually be hilarious
[8646.62 → 8649.42] If sponsorships cost like a hundred bucks
[8650.22 → 8653.82] And we just had like as many sponsors as humanly possible
[8654.38 → 8657.02] Like sponsored by Daniel lesser
[8657.02 → 8659.02] I
[8659.02 → 8661.74] I would do it. I'll spend my money on it. I'd buy that for a dollar
[8661.74 → 8664.54] Well, look yeah, we could take we could take all that like look
[8664.54 → 8666.22] It's not that I want Daniel lesser's money
[8666.22 → 8669.98] We could put it in the prize pool because we're going to have f**king prizes. Yeah, obviously
[8669.98 → 8674.70] Yeah, and I need at least one that's five thousand and one dollar's so that we can exceed the limit
[8675.50 → 8677.50] So we need some money
[8678.54 → 8678.86] I
[8678.86 → 8680.86] I would I would sponsor this tournament
[8682.38 → 8683.58] I don't know what it would be
[8684.22 → 8690.22] But it just I don't know it just be me, or I'll do it in like the name of doing it the name of float plane is maybe not a great idea
[8690.78 → 8692.94] I mean, we're doing it as a don't know either way
[8692.94 → 8699.02] I would put in a hundred bucks myself just because this plan sounds amazing to me
[8699.02 → 8704.54] Yeah, no, I think this is just the kind of thing that we have to do because it's the right thing to do
[8704.86 → 8706.86] This is if you guys read through this doc
[8707.42 → 8709.66] I've I've I've already given you some highlights
[8710.30 → 8715.10] But you'll be more angry than I am right now. This is not how you treat anyone
[8715.42 → 8717.42] Let alone your paying customers, especially
[8717.42 → 8722.54] Not the ones who are so dedicated that they spend actual real time
[8723.26 → 8728.38] Considerable time out of their lives to master your product to master your game
[8728.70 → 8734.14] To to to get together with other people in the community and share their love of your product that's
[8735.66 → 8741.90] It's broken is the only way that I can describe the manner of thinking that could possibly
[8742.54 → 8744.54] Lead you to create this document
[8745.90 → 8747.34] It's broken
[8748.06 → 8754.30] I just want to read this message out because it's hilarious, and the name is also great. It's from clapped k24 accord
[8754.62 → 8761.58] On float plane chat. He says I work construction in Ontario and I would buy a sponsorship on behalf of the employer just for the memes
[8765.26 → 8767.26] Oh my goodness
[8767.74 → 8771.02] I have to I should I contact brand now
[8771.02 → 8777.74] This is great we need to know when this is and stuff because there's like
[8779.18 → 8786.30] Especially if the is there are prizes exceeding five grand there's like players that are going to want to come up
[8787.90 → 8789.90] I bet you well, yeah sure yeah
[8790.14 → 8795.58] Well, I mean I have to I have to find at least one high profile player and pay them an appearance fee. Yeah
[8795.58 → 8799.02] Because like that's one of the rules. That's one of the rules
[8800.06 → 8800.46] I will
[8801.26 → 8802.06] Luke
[8802.06 → 8806.22] No, I believe you I will break every rule humanly possible
[8807.26 → 8811.02] We need to have like a checklist to really make sure we hit everything to be clear
[8811.02 → 8816.30] We're going to know we're gonna check with the lawyers. We're going to make sure that anything that is a real actual
[8816.30 → 8819.02] Rule like according to the law
[8819.82 → 8822.86] We're going to make sure that we don't break those like I'm not going to have a single Nintendo
[8823.50 → 8825.82] We won't use their IPs absolutely not
[8826.46 → 8831.02] Yeah, but to imagine for a second that you can tell me in my building
[8831.90 → 8834.94] With my event that I'm allowed to
[8835.66 → 8838.86] Charge x amount for admission. No, the admission is going to be
[8839.42 → 8841.74] 15 pounds and one pence
[8841.74 → 8846.70] I actually do all the transactions
[8849.42 → 8851.42] People have to pay
[8851.58 → 8858.14] An exchange rate to pay us then we have to exchange it back to like actually use the funds just to make it works
[8859.74 → 8861.74] It's ridiculous
[8861.90 → 8866.46] Ridiculous so we'll check into it, and you know what to be clear if the lawyer comes back and says
[8867.50 → 8870.86] You know what they actually probably can get you for this. They can bury you
[8870.86 → 8874.78] Yeah, I'm gonna bail because part of my, and I'll tell you guys
[8874.78 → 8877.26] I'll give you guys the update because the premise for me is
[8877.90 → 8883.90] That this does not appear to be in any way legally enforceable. It seems to be just ridiculous
[8884.46 → 8887.18] customer hatred for no apparent reason
[8887.74 → 8890.78] Um, just Nintendo pure Nintendo arrogance
[8891.18 → 8895.82] Um, but if I'm wrong I'm not going to be the arrogant one. I will stand down
[8895.82 → 8903.90] I doubt that I'm wrong yeah for someone to tell me what video game I can play in my building
[8906.38 → 8909.90] You've got to be kidding me yeah, it's ridiculous and hosting a smash tournament would be sick
[8910.94 → 8913.58] So why not yeah heck yeah?
[8914.78 → 8915.02] Um
[8915.02 → 8919.50] Um, oh, we're talking about uh, we're talking about names now whale smash
[8920.14 → 8925.90] Whale smash oh, I don't know yeah, that sounds not great it sounds too similar to seal clubbing
[8928.06 → 8929.26] Okay, now I like it yeah
[8930.86 → 8932.94] We're back on track oh my goodness
[8932.94 → 8936.62] Lt smash
[8937.74 → 8941.42] Yeah, that's actually not bad. Yeah, that's not bad. That's not bad either
[8941.74 → 8946.78] Yeah, I mean I might want to just to be just to be just to be snarky
[8947.34 → 8948.78] whale bros is not bad either
[8949.74 → 8953.58] I might avoid bros and smash probably get it. Yeah, whales mush
[8954.22 → 8955.66] whale mash
[8955.66 → 8960.94] They did the mash they did the whale mash cartoon digital fighting championship
[8960.94 → 8964.30] Oh, name it like LTT store. I love it
[8965.90 → 8967.90] digital
[8968.78 → 8971.42] Digital fighting game adequate video service
[8972.62 → 8974.62] leather backpack
[8975.66 → 8978.94] Hey, what did we call the new pants did we break off of it? Oh
[8979.90 → 8981.90] No off of what?
[8981.90 → 8988.54] LTT premium short joggers. Nope. It's a sport joggers. Yeah, that's what they're called isn't it?
[8988.54 → 8992.06] It's what they are. Yeah, the names are what they are. So this is
[8992.70 → 8999.90] Digital cartoon fighting champion. We'll get there at some point with digital cartoon fighting championship with sponsors and prizes
[9001.02 → 9003.02] dot-com
[9004.78 → 9006.86] Oh boy you guys
[9007.50 → 9008.06] um
[9008.06 → 9013.18] anyway, this made me really mad and I'm surprised you didn't think this was a topic because I was like
[9014.06 → 9021.02] Very excited to talk about it. I shouldn't say excite. I was very passionate to talk about it. Furthermore, I honestly this is another one of the things like
[9021.02 → 9025.82] Okay, so the first topic you were like, oh, you must have been offline the PS5 thing. I saw it
[9025.82 → 9029.10] I just thought it was a meme. I didn't believe it and then with this
[9029.34 → 9033.82] I didn't I just saw like oh Nintendo's being jerks again, and I didn't really read into it
[9033.82 → 9035.82] I didn't know it was about tournaments
[9035.98 → 9042.46] Um, I just thought they were like hammering on some streamer for playing their game or something, and I was like, oh, Nintendo's back at it again
[9043.26 → 9044.22] um
[9044.22 → 9046.22] But yeah rough
[9049.50 → 9054.22] Hey, we got to mention the folding competition November 1st. Yeah, um
[9054.70 → 9063.34] It's once the sixth. Okay. I don't know what any of that means, but it's folding month starting November 1st and running until December 6th
[9063.90 → 9065.90] 6th
[9066.14 → 9070.70] Sign up information is available now on Ltd forum. There are lots of prizes including
[9070.70 → 9075.74] What gift cards? I just read something Conrad said
[9076.54 → 9078.54] Okay, copy pretty good
[9078.54 → 9084.06] Are you going to share it with the rest of the class? Did you see it? Did you find it?
[9084.70 → 9086.70] No
[9086.70 → 9090.70] Linus media group presents smash me bro
[9090.70 → 9093.42] A Super Smash Bros tournament?
[9093.42 → 9101.10] It's very funny. Oh, yeah, I think the evolution of trust me, bro. Yeah, the relationship has expanded. Yeah, we uh
[9101.10 → 9103.10] We're close
[9103.90 → 9104.86] We're close
[9104.86 → 9109.90] Who are you going to get as a title sponsor? We're really close with our customers. Oh, I assumed brand's going to want a piece of that
[9110.06 → 9112.86] Yeah, uh, I haven't actually heard back from them yet
[9112.86 → 9120.14] But it's almost it's almost certainly something that they'd be down for if they don't think they can, they're actually going to get buried by Nintendo
[9120.14 → 9123.34] Oh, I like this evolution as well. Just call it sue me, bro
[9128.94 → 9132.54] But maybe it's sue me is one word so it has kind of like uh
[9132.54 → 9138.14] Yeah, like sort of like a Japanese vibe sue me. Oh, sue me, bro. Yeah, sue me, bro. Yeah

[9158.22 → 9160.62] Possibly more to come there better be more to come. Oh, yeah, okay
[9160.62 → 9163.74] Well there's like two grand and Ltd store gift cards. Okay, we did some stuff
[9163.98 → 9168.38] Wow, actually like community members are donating prizes and the full-in community
[9168.38 → 9171.74] This has been a thing for yeah, never ceases to amaze me
[9172.06 → 9177.42] Um, maybe we can maybe we can get some maybe we can get some hardware in there as well. That would be pretty cool
[9177.74 → 9182.06] Uh, I'll have to stay I'll have to check with chewy and see if um, see if we can do something like that
[9182.46 → 9186.38] Uh, if you wanna is you want to handle the next topic while I send that sure forgets
[9186.94 → 9188.94] What do we get left?
[9188.94 → 9190.94] Um
[9190.94 → 9197.58] 82% of the states sues meta 41 us states are suing meta also previously known as Facebook
[9197.82 → 9206.62] Uh for designing its platforms to encourage compulsive behaviour in young users through addictive features such as infinite scrolling and persistent alerts
[9206.78 → 9209.50] I'm going to take a pause here from what is written in the doc to say
[9210.14 → 9214.70] Wow, really, but they should sue a ton of other people and not single out meta
[9214.70 → 9216.70] I'm not trying to defend meta here
[9216.70 → 9224.22] But like what infinite scrolling and persistent alerts is this not every social media platform?
[9225.26 → 9231.50] Like cleave them all don't just go for one. What it is weird that they're going after well remember part of it is precedent
[9231.50 → 9235.50] So if they win this they need to win this one precedent you know
[9235.50 → 9236.38] If they do this one
[9236.38 → 9239.02] You don't want to open up battles on every front at the same time then you're Germany
[9240.06 → 9240.62] Fair enough
[9241.18 → 9242.38] That's how that's what you lose
[9243.50 → 9243.98] um
[9244.22 → 9245.50] You lose heart
[9245.50 → 9249.34] Yeah, um, okay, so if they do win then they need to keep going
[9249.66 → 9253.98] um, because it's its it feels weird like diving in front of meta who I
[9253.98 → 9259.26] Don't like or care about at all. Um, but I know have you tried the quest three yet? No
[9259.98 → 9261.18] I've spent some time with it
[9261.98 → 9263.26] Adam who's working on
[9263.82 → 9267.58] Writing the review with some contributions from me like we're kind of working together on it
[9268.14 → 9269.26] He spent some time with it
[9270.38 → 9275.50] It's perfect. Okay. Okay. It's like perfect though. Either way. I just think if you're is you're going to go for
[9276.38 → 9277.90] Them for what they're saying they're going
[9278.54 → 9282.38] At them for you need to go after more places including ticktock like come on
[9282.94 → 9284.06] um
[9284.06 → 9289.82] The lawsuits allege that meta knowingly ignored the product's effect on children's mental health for the sake of profit
[9289.82 → 9294.78] And that its algorithm pushes vulnerable teens towards content glorifying. Can I stop you for a second here?
[9295.26 → 9296.22] um
[9296.22 → 9298.22] knowingly ignoring the harms
[9299.74 → 9303.74] In the pursuit of profit are they suing meta or are they suing capitalism?
[9305.82 → 9310.62] Yeah, this is kind of my point as a capitalist as a filthy capitalist
[9311.42 → 9313.74] Isn't that just isn't that just capitalism?
[9314.22 → 9314.94] Yeah, kind of
[9316.22 → 9319.74] Okay, carry on as long as it's within the extent of the law whatever blah blah blah
[9320.94 → 9327.66] Many studies including meta's own internal research indicate that heavy social media use is associated with depression anxiety and lower self-esteem
[9327.82 → 9331.58] This is a reason I'm going on an aside again. This is the reason why I have
[9332.46 → 9336.94] Very specifically been engaging less, and actually it's been great
[9337.58 → 9339.34] I have seen zero downsides
[9339.90 → 9345.26] I even know less topics when I show up for wan show and Linus finds that more entertaining. So if anything only benefits
[9346.62 → 9353.50] Anyway, especially in younger users meta argues that the benefits of increased connection outweigh these harms
[9354.06 → 9355.26] Mmm disagree
[9355.82 → 9361.34] Anyway, uh discussion question are there popular social media sites that don't encourage addiction?
[9362.14 → 9366.46] I don't know of any uh could a non-addictive alternative to Instagram even compete
[9367.18 → 9373.10] No, no, no, it wouldn't yeah social media is inherently this eyeball ownership
[9373.66 → 9373.90] Yep
[9374.94 → 9377.02] Um in other words speaking of
[9377.82 → 9379.66] ownership digital rev
[9380.38 → 9382.38] just deleted
[9382.94 → 9387.82] The entire YouTube channel that was active between 2007 and 2019
[9388.46 → 9396.06] That means hundreds of videos from their catalogue are gone without warning at the time of writing only nine videos remain
[9396.06 → 9401.34] The channel's former host Kai and former editor lock are still making photography related content
[9401.34 → 9403.98] But they were not informed that the deletion would take place
[9404.38 → 9409.98] The deleted videos include years worth of reviews how to be and photography tips
[9410.78 → 9416.14] Several commenters cited digital rev as a formative influence in their decision to get into photography as a profession
[9416.14 → 9423.90] Or hobby and the discussion question here is there any reason to delete an archive like this?
[9425.02 → 9426.06] The answer is
[9427.02 → 9433.10] Oh, go ahead. I've been kind of wondering about this kind of stuff because what's with the war on like camera reviews?
[9434.06 → 9436.62] Yeah, I don't know like what why it's so
[9437.18 → 9439.98] It's not profitable. Yeah, but why take it all down?
[9439.98 → 9443.02] So that that back to the question
[9443.90 → 9449.02] The only reason I can think of is if the channel had a complicated
[9449.66 → 9453.26] Licensing agreement with the producer of the content
[9454.06 → 9459.02] Because otherwise there is absolutely no reason whatsoever
[9460.06 → 9466.86] For you to for you to private a video that is as non-controversial as digital rev. Yeah
[9466.86 → 9474.54] Um, you will still collect residual revenue on every view on that content in perpetuity
[9475.42 → 9479.66] Even if it's not very much even if it's not very much five bucks is five bucks
[9479.66 → 9485.02] Like I can't, I can't imagine a future where I would take down
[9485.98 → 9487.82] any LTT video even if
[9488.94 → 9491.10] everyone was gone
[9491.90 → 9492.94] Um
[9492.94 → 9497.82] And the company didn't exist anymore, and I had no interest in making videos
[9497.82 → 9502.06] I'd been cancelled or something or whatever right like I can't think of any reason
[9502.46 → 9506.22] Their own community posts are pointing towards videos that they've taken down
[9507.50 → 9509.50] Brutal
[9512.62 → 9516.38] Speaking of things that should be a crime like I just I
[9516.38 → 9518.38] I
[9518.38 → 9524.38] Don't know man like I get it if there's is there's a license agreement or something in place and they can't
[9525.18 → 9528.22] They can't have them up, but like why these nine videos?
[9528.86 → 9533.66] Or ten or whatever they are like these are playlists that when you click on them are just empty
[9533.66 → 9535.74] Oh, if you go to the channel, there's a hand no, no, I know
[9535.74 → 9539.82] I'm just showing how like it this was done like quickly and
[9540.94 → 9544.14] Not cleanly they ripped these videos out didn't look back
[9544.14 → 9546.14] This is all the videos that remain
[9547.42 → 9554.46] These are okay Elijah in the chat asks why am I watching this show right now when I'm supposed to be in recovery and not looking at screens?
[9555.26 → 9557.26] That's a good question. Sorry Elijah
[9557.82 → 9562.78] Actually asked okay, would you take down all the LTT videos for an enormous sum of money?
[9563.42 → 9569.98] But the answer like, but the thing is who would pay for them to take their videos down nobody there's no incentive for that
[9569.98 → 9575.42] Like I just I can't people are saying storage costs money, right?
[9575.42 → 9581.74] But yeah, to Google it doesn't Google. Yeah, it actually costs nothing. Yeah, there is no benefit
[9582.30 → 9584.30] to taking this down
[9584.38 → 9589.26] And if anything the is you don't want to store it locally anymore, and you don't care about it at all
[9589.26 → 9594.14] Just delete your local files and leave them on YouTube because it's not trusting you anything sure fine
[9594.14 → 9596.14] I
[9600.30 → 9602.86] Don't know cs2 players banned for spinning
[9603.66 → 9608.22] several counterstrike 2 players have gotten VAC banned apparently for moving the mouse too fast
[9608.70 → 9615.18] players were able to replicate the problem and successfully get auto banned by setting their mouse sensitivity at 10 000 plus dpi and
[9615.42 → 9616.78] spinning in place
[9616.78 → 9623.34] Some were able to incur a ban within a single match to see a demonstration of one of these tests see this time stamp
[9624.14 → 9626.14] You should check the video out yourself
[9627.66 → 9635.50] Yeah, I'm just going to see the rest of it. It's from tabby and dump and
[9636.70 → 9638.70] Let's see what else is going on here
[9639.02 → 9642.14] But yeah, basically people if you crank up the dpi in your mouse
[9642.70 → 9646.46] um and spin around you can get banned and okay
[9648.86 → 9652.78] I feel a little weird about this one, but this is a thing people sometimes do yeah
[9652.78 → 9654.78] Just a goof around a sign of frustration
[9654.86 → 9658.46] Yeah, or just goofing around is just whipping your mouse around a counterstrike
[9658.46 → 9663.10] This is like actually a thing that yeah backbanned from the server. It's in the video, but
[9663.82 → 9665.98] Wow, this is also spun batting
[9666.46 → 9671.58] It's one of like the most old-school versions of aim hacking and counterstrike we've ever had
[9672.46 → 9675.90] So I understand why they would try to have something that detects
[9675.90 → 9682.38] A rotational speed that they believe is not really achievable by a human and then go okay, let's ban this player
[9683.18 → 9686.46] Now in my opinion the huge issue with this
[9687.02 → 9687.34] um
[9688.86 → 9690.62] Is how like not that easy
[9691.26 → 9693.42] Dealing with valve customer support is
[9696.70 → 9698.38] Because if this was like a detection thing
[9698.38 → 9700.62] Mm-hmm, and they just bumped people out
[9701.34 → 9704.78] And people could appeal it and be like oh, there's just messing around and then
[9705.66 → 9706.06] uh
[9706.22 → 9710.06] Valve had the ability to watch the match and see like yeah, oh
[9710.06 → 9713.50] This is just someone like sitting in spawn Deeping around before the match starts
[9714.46 → 9715.58] Then uh, whatever
[9716.14 → 9717.82] I don't think it's that big of a deal, but
[9720.86 → 9723.98] Hydro 777 asks explain spin batting please
[9724.70 → 9729.10] Spin batting, so I don't actually remember it's been a long time since I've looked into this but
[9729.10 → 9732.14] I don't remember the reason why it needed to spin so much
[9732.14 → 9739.42] But it would essentially just anything that appeared on your screen would just die basically because your character was spinning around and ready to fire
[9740.06 → 9742.38] Or actually firing. I don't remember the exact details
[9742.94 → 9747.02] Um, but yeah, you're just like aiming everywhere able to shoot everything
[9747.58 → 9749.50] I never ran one. So I don't know 100 how it works
[9749.50 → 9754.38] Got it. Yeah, you were a death machine you spin around and everything would die
[9756.14 → 9757.18] In other news
[9757.66 → 9762.14] What if you were a freedom machine? Oh, it was probably to detect more units
[9763.50 → 9766.70] Yeah, what if you were a freedom machine? What does that even mean?
[9767.34 → 9770.38] Freedom phone? Oh, yeah, baby. This is interesting
[9771.26 → 9773.82] Unplugged are here. Do you want to read it? I'm going to screen share
[9774.38 → 9780.78] Unplugged is currently taking pre-orders for what they call the up phone which runs their proprietary rust base OS
[9781.26 → 9790.38] liberty OS not to be confused with liberty OS and features a physical kill switch that unplugs the phone's processor and sensors
[9790.70 → 9792.14] from the battery
[9792.14 → 9796.30] the phone comes with eight gigabytes of ram 256 gigabytes of storage and a
[9796.30 → 9798.30] uh
[9798.30 → 9800.30] 108 megapixel 4k camera
[9801.42 → 9808.06] It likewise features an always-on VPN ad blockers antivirus and a suite of apps that unplugged say
[9808.62 → 9813.66] Definitely won't mind user data unplugged also claims that they have hired cybersecurity form
[9814.30 → 9821.66] CY security as an advisor as well as hiring independent auditors to conduct periodic penetration tests on
[9821.66 → 9829.50] our platform security they also have white hat programs with uh prizes as a bounty for reporting vulnerabilities
[9830.62 → 9836.38] Unplugged has gotten some criticism from the past from cybersecurity experts for using terms like
[9837.10 → 9847.18] impenetrable and government grade encryption in its marketing because no device is truly impenetrable and governments don't really have access to encryption that private entities do not
[9847.18 → 9849.50] also have access to unplugged well
[9850.38 → 9859.98] theoretically unplugged has however stepped away from that language unplugged notably was founded by Eric price who was the founder of private military contractor
[9860.62 → 9865.10] blackwater uh then known as something else now known as
[9866.06 → 9867.34] uh
[9867.34 → 9872.30] Not that what it is sounds very different um blackwater
[9873.02 → 9873.90] renamed
[9873.90 → 9875.58] Academic
[9875.58 → 9878.62] oh wow okay that's a different name yeah sounds extremely different
[9878.94 → 9882.38] um they've rebranded a couple of times been trying to get away from
[9883.02 → 9886.54] because like everyone in the world knew like oh blackwater is scary
[9887.18 → 9889.98] right so they're like Academic we'd read books or something
[9890.70 → 9890.94] um
[9890.94 → 9893.02] yeah
[9893.02 → 9895.10] um security or sorry
[9895.82 → 9897.50] discussion question my brain just
[9898.14 → 9903.74] did that um is it possible that this could succeed where every previous ultra secure phone
[9903.74 → 9905.74] idea has failed no
[9909.90 → 9910.14] yeah
[9912.70 → 9919.34] I mean it could be an improvement if these weren't things that you were just already going to do
[9919.34 → 9928.06] yourself I mean you could just have a VPN yeah exactly um you could just um I mean one of their one of their talking points is
[9928.06 → 9934.14] uncensored you can download any app you want you can do that today you can just sideload an APK
[9934.14 → 9935.82] um yeah
[9935.82 → 9945.74] I'd, I'm interested in what the liberty OS actually is I'd be interested to know what it actually is the problem is I don't think it actually is anything
[9946.14 → 9952.46] um we talked about this in writers meeting, and we had that's where this lead came from because we were thinking oh well we should do a review of it
[9952.46 → 9956.14] and the issue with doing a review of it is that right now
[9956.62 → 9963.42] they're taking a crowdfunding approach to getting this thing out and I don't think since we looked at it, it has made
[9963.98 → 9965.82] any progress if I was them and i
[9966.38 → 9971.42] knew that I needed to sell 6 000 units of this thing before I could move to mass production
[9972.06 → 9972.62] um
[9972.62 → 9976.06] I probably wouldn't, I probably wouldn't put this bar on my site
[9976.06 → 9983.02] also is this to scale I don't think so I was just wondering that myself I don't I don't think so
[9983.66 → 9987.90] uh do I need to do I need to MS Paint this I had to squint there because I was like is that supposed to be a
[9987.90 → 9993.34] nine or a zero at the start because either of them feel wrong okay here you know what we're doing it
[9993.34 → 9996.38] we're doing it we're ms painting it um
[10000.46 → 10005.50] because it should be a six basically, and it doesn't look like it is
[10006.06 → 10011.02] okay so we're going to take one of these
[10015.90 → 10017.26] I'm sure there's a better way to do this
[10022.46 → 10025.98] what why did you include like the back of the circle well it's not that much
[10025.98 → 10032.62] oh hold on it might be to scale Luke
[10035.50 → 10038.62] you know what oh I see what you're doing I think it's to scale
[10039.82 → 10045.26] six 943s yeah that would be about that okay wow so we both suck all right we both just it's
[10045.26 → 10051.58] an optical illusion collectively so it's an optical illusion yeah uh okay Dan is it APN fixed
[10051.58 → 10058.46] I'm so sorry but I managed to do it if you managed to do it oh good thanks Dan I'm so happy um it
[10058.46 → 10065.02] took all of that time it took all that time you uh you will not get Wi-Fi calling, and you will not
[10065.02 → 10071.34] get voice over LTE so you can't have 4g calling so every time somebody calls you, or you try to make a
[10071.34 → 10078.70] call it will drop back onto the GSM 3g network and um I had the issue with my previous phone because it
[10078.70 → 10085.90] was a similar thing uh you just won't get phone calls just won't work properly oh unless you're in
[10085.90 → 10094.06] a very, very good service area oh uh okay well that's now this is not, not good in my line of work
[10094.06 → 10100.70] this is my rant about the Canadian mobile network system because the phone supports every single band
[10100.70 → 10109.90] in Canada oh, but our carriers do not support the phone I'm sorry it's like carrier now a bunch of
[10109.90 → 10115.90] them just merged by the way people did inspect element and found that it is 15.7 of the bar
[10115.90 → 10124.62] which is actually exactly 943 out of 6 000 so it's it is definitely correct, and we were definitely wrong
[10124.62 → 10132.06] cool well I can admit when I'm wrong yeah and when the up phone or whatever they're calling it um
[10132.06 → 10138.22] unplugged phone up phone exists I will admit that I was wrong that it will ever exist because I am
[10138.22 → 10143.50] telling you now it will never exist very cool they're done they're out um okay I tried to call
[10143.50 → 10150.22] Luke, and it didn't work though oh wait so I can't place phone calls only if you have 3g connection if i
[10150.22 → 10159.50] have 3g cellular which they're phasing it so it's uh it's not as prevalent as LTE I don't think you
[10159.50 → 10165.90] could actually use it if you can't do calling no you can but just not very well yeah, but he needs
[10165.90 → 10170.78] his phone to work yeah it's not triggering the proper carrier provisioning, and it should because
[10170.78 → 10178.14] the 100 of it's even got most of our 5g bands uh, but you can't use Wi-Fi calling you can't do voice over
[10178.14 → 10185.10] LTE I ended up having to just get a new phone I tried to rewrite the Broadcom modem because it was
[10185.10 → 10193.74] driving me mad I'm like linus loves his fold and I love my uh my Sony's but they just
[10195.50 → 10198.46] Canada hates anything that's not a pixel um
[10198.46 → 10210.14] um okay uh hmm I see let me try to call you well on the plus side I'll get a lot less spam calls
[10211.74 → 10218.22] I see this is an absolute win um okay well what I got a call from you so that worked but wait can I
[10218.22 → 10224.30] actually talk to you oh yeah if you get the call if I get a call I can well what the crap how does
[10224.30 → 10229.02] that make any sense well because it was able to drop onto the network properly I mean try and call
[10229.02 → 10234.54] Luke now it might work oh no service area just it just dropped yeah no I hung up oh yeah why did it say
[10234.54 → 10239.42] at a service area because what it did is it went okay now I have to drop the 3g network and now reconnect
[10239.42 → 10246.14] to the LTE network and then so when you try to make a call it has to drop the LTE get onto 3g and then place
[10246.14 → 10250.46] the call so it's very intermittent depending on your service quality
[10253.10 → 10259.58] this is stupid emergency calls only that one always makes me really mad because if you can
[10259.58 → 10267.50] place an emergency call you can place the other call if I have an active subscription uh okay top
[10267.50 → 10274.70] gear in flow plane no they will not they will absolutely not let you do that if you bring your
[10274.70 → 10280.38] own device they go sorry that it is not supported on our network go away you can buy one of our other
[10280.38 → 10287.26] phones you can place emergency calls with it that's fine yeah apparently emergency calls mostly use 2g
[10287.26 → 10292.86] yeah I was going to say I think there's actually like government allotted uh bans for emergency calls all
[10292.86 → 10297.10] right fine yeah I didn't want to rain on your parade but I think that's a thing I'll allow it
[10297.10 → 10304.30] I'll allow Sancho after dark as well oh let's go I'm going to push the button I'm just stoked about this
[10304.30 → 10313.74] smash tournament nice it sounds fun I don't know what irreverent tournament of all time yeah like i
[10313.74 → 10318.94] don't know what I'm more excited for like the smash tournament itself or just what it represents I think
[10318.94 → 10323.18] I'm more excited about what it represents than anything else like man I'm gonna I'm gonna play in the
[10323.18 → 10330.06] tournament I might even pay myself an appearance fee not because I'm any good at smash just you know
[10330.06 → 10337.26] whatever yeah promoting the event can i sponsor players i I don't care yeah I can I uh I'm gonna
[10337.26 → 10343.66] sponsor a player I think that's that's cool I'm going to have shirts made uh nice this is sick
[10344.94 → 10346.70] you know who you are you better learn how to play
[10346.70 → 10354.78] actually no it's like uh top percentile it'll be great okay that sounds good I love it
[10354.78 → 10360.30] hell yeah um let's go all right okay what do we get uh let's see we already read that one
[10361.02 → 10366.86] Linus have you had any experiences with the Amazon one palm entry stores how do you feel about the palm
[10366.86 → 10373.58] reading technology do you see this spreading to other companies for different applications palm entry oh
[10373.58 → 10379.02] like you use your palm to enter the store sorry I haven't even heard about this I have no
[10379.02 → 10384.86] idea what they're talking about Amazon's been testing some really weird stores I mean I don't see why
[10384.86 → 10392.46] it's necessary you use your palm to pay present a loyalty card enter a venue or badge into work why palm
[10393.74 → 10396.62] oh it's contactless oh
[10396.62 → 10405.26] oh because the characteristics of your palm are so much easier to read at a distance compared to the
[10405.26 → 10414.38] characteristics of your fingers well if it wasn't for not wanting them to have a database of my
[10414.38 → 10421.02] biometrics because unless this is yeah this doesn't sound like something that's stored locally on a device
[10421.02 → 10428.78] and then like encrypted um like if it wasn't for that that would be super cool
[10431.26 → 10438.46] right but it, but that is the thing because if it's just taking an image and then going to a central
[10438.46 → 10447.10] server that's terrible yeah and I don't like that at all yeah huh time to chop off people's hands and
[10447.10 → 10460.38] steal stuff oh boy oh now that's a future yeah um wow that is uh that's a thing that could happen now
[10460.38 → 10465.34] cool current year gets worse uh okay
[10465.34 → 10474.62] uh
[10476.78 → 10482.22] Dan yeah do you want another one yes uh okay
[10484.14 → 10490.54] it's stupid hard to find all cotton clothes in North America especially sweats long sizes
[10490.54 → 10497.42] thank you for the dropout why do you think it's so rare and not as oh sorry uh why do you think it's
[10497.42 → 10505.74] so rare and is there more all cotton coming um oh I don't know I mean honestly a big part of the reason
[10505.74 → 10511.90] that for me is that I don't actually prefer all cotton clothing i um I don't find it as comfortable as
[10511.90 → 10518.86] blends and I find that it shrinks a lot and so it's really, really difficult to get the sizing
[10518.86 → 10523.50] right so that it can be worn out of the box and also worn a year later once it's been through the
[10523.50 → 10530.46] tumble dryer a couple dozen times um that's that's my own take on it, I also know there are benefits to
[10530.46 → 10537.18] cotton I know that it's easier to um repurpose once it's done being clothing um
[10537.18 → 10542.62] um yeah it's i that's that's all I know personally about it
[10545.66 → 10549.82] hey Luke how do you like your pixel 8 pro watching LAN live for the first time
[10549.82 → 10553.98] heard your notification go off thought it was my phone oh sorry um
[10556.78 → 10564.30] me i I think I'm a very boring person to review phones um yeah I tried to have him do it before he
[10564.30 → 10567.66] wasn't very good at it wow I think one of my pixel reviews is actually pretty good
[10569.58 → 10576.46] so there's that one line of phones that you kind of like every third one and can do a good video
[10576.46 → 10579.90] about well that's perfect you should be a professional phone reviewer I never wanted to be
[10579.90 → 10585.66] to be clear just wanted to cover pixels i would probably watch that oh we got the pixel 8 pro
[10587.74 → 10592.62] tune in next week don't forget to like and subscribe I just like pretty much everything I do on my phone is
[10592.62 → 10602.06] on my home screen it's like float plane chess email calling basic web browsing that's it um it's heavy
[10602.86 → 10609.74] the camera bump is like enormous and really annoying and doesn't fit very well in your pocket with
[10609.74 → 10616.70] anything else in your pocket um the fact that I don't have the menu thing on the back now you can
[10616.70 → 10622.38] slam your finger against it, and maybe it'll do something sometimes uh is not an acceptable
[10622.38 → 10628.22] replacement in my opinion um I had a button before that was also a fingerprint sensor, and you could
[10628.22 → 10634.22] also swipe on, and you could find it easily, and it was a lot better so I lost some functionality um oh
[10634.22 → 10640.22] yay it's faster yeah I don't care I play chess and send text-based messages it doesn't matter to me
[10640.22 → 10651.58] almost at all um, but it's an android phone that has pixel features, and it's not broken so it's an
[10651.58 → 10659.34] upgrade over what I had before and that's how I feel about it good job honestly if I could have my
[10659.34 → 10664.70] previous phone, and it was not broken, and it was still supported with security updates I would rather
[10664.70 → 10674.30] just have my previous phone again if it just wasn't broken so like I don't know if you had to buy 60
[10674.30 → 10682.94] TVs all the same size and brand where would you shop Costco did they even let you buy that many I mean
[10682.94 → 10691.34] it's Costco we bought like man I think we looked for quantities up to 200 gallons or something like that
[10691.34 → 10694.78] and Costco was the cheapest place to buy isopropyl alcohol don't ask why
[10699.90 → 10708.22] they also sell uh barrel drums uh didn't we buy like a palette of up's from them as well yeah yeah
[10708.22 → 10714.46] definitely that's the thing we did will there ever be an option to purchase signed items for instance
[10714.46 → 10723.02] the children's book autographed by Linus um yep we have a plan for getting rid of all the crap from the
[10723.02 → 10723.50] tech shop
[10726.86 → 10734.62] we're planning to list it on the site as a loot box you get a random item we have no idea what you're
[10734.62 → 10741.42] going to get if it works is it doesn't, but it'll be signed so it's an it's a piece of memorabilia sure
[10741.42 → 10745.74] and then we're just going to do like a cost averaging thing so that we kind of don't
[10745.74 → 10751.26] completely lose our shirts on it, but people have a chance of ending up with something cool um
[10752.94 → 10755.74] and you can just have a piece of video history
[10757.90 → 10762.94] maybe even a cool piece yeah you maybe it's probably a random crappy cable probably garbage
[10762.94 → 10769.18] probably garbage but signed garbage yeah so I'm going to have to sing I think it worked out to about 600
[10769.18 → 10774.62] items nice yeah that's going to take some time can you forge my signature you want to help I used to
[10774.62 → 10780.46] be able to it's been a long time I did it at are you okay a really and b are you gonna you're gonna
[10780.46 → 10787.74] talk about this on camera no you knew oh did I yeah wait you actually forgot I guess oh wow
[10789.10 → 10792.70] we had a conversation about this at one point because you knew I did it for a while
[10792.70 → 10795.90] and then at some point we had a sit-down conversation you were like you know
[10795.90 → 10803.02] we're like an actual company now you should stop doing that and I was like okay, and you were like
[10803.02 → 10807.26] yeah like I'm not like I knew you're doing it I'm not like mad we just should probably stop doing this
[10807.26 → 10812.54] and I'm like I'm going to have to bug you more often, and you're like yeah I was like okay
[10815.58 → 10819.74] nobody got paid for six weeks someone knew that story because we've told that story on
[10819.74 → 10821.90] Sancho before which is why I'm surprised you don't remember
[10821.90 → 10828.06] um, but someone knew that story at Ltd and asked me to forge your signature at Ltd yeah I know they
[10828.06 → 10833.10] brought it to me, and you did a bad job so I fixed it but I didn't have like a visual representation
[10833.10 → 10836.78] at the time or anything I had to do it from memory and I was like wow I don't know all right
[10838.38 → 10845.98] I don't know um sorry what was the question Luke's phone review in under five seconds I don't know all
[10845.98 → 10851.58] the videos are going to be the same I'm just going to go every time almost every phone is just fine these
[10851.58 → 10858.30] days yeah they're all pretty good there are exceptions I can't even use it I'm left-handed
[10858.86 → 10861.82] I actually bet you if the calling wasn't an issue I wouldn't even mind that
[10862.62 → 10868.14] uh it's really heavy it's really thick I don't is it really much heavier than this is it really much
[10868.14 → 10873.26] thicker than this it's way thicker than that look at them, it is way thicker than that jeez include the
[10873.26 → 10874.62] camera bump include the camera bump
[10874.62 → 10883.42] why do they even have camera bumps it's thinner optics den the camera bump is insane to make the phone
[10883.42 → 10884.62] it's so huge
[10887.10 → 10887.66] and then wait
[10893.26 → 10895.10] what am I waiting for oh my god
[10895.10 → 10904.14] oh it's so worth if it's so worth it is killed it that hurt me I have a small ding
[10906.30 → 10912.54] this is definitely heavier and part of it is the length so it's heavy, and it's a tall aspect ratio
[10912.54 → 10919.82] so it like it wants to it wants to go it wants to be free yeah it's so slippy like a bird on
[10919.82 → 10927.02] the wing sorry um I've held a pixelated non-pro and I wish the pixelate pro features and all that
[10927.02 → 10931.42] other kind of stuff were just in to pixelate non-pros like body yeah I would have preferred
[10931.42 → 10939.02] that phone yep dear, dear LLD I will use my first ever purchase in the hopes of getting you guys to
[10939.02 → 10948.46] talk more Final Fantasy six oh yeah Linus Edgar or Sabine sabin well okay those aren't three
[10948.46 → 10955.58] characters it's Linus Edgar or cabin um well I mean it depends at what point in the game right
[10956.14 → 10962.14] uh I don't want to don't spoil it right I'm like actually enjoying it okay um
[10963.42 → 10967.90] I like is it cabin do you pronounce it cabin uh there's a lot of debate I ran into both of those
[10967.90 → 10973.58] characters because it's one of those things where the I think the the the Japanese name is like mash
[10973.58 → 10981.26] or something and so the translation is just like whatever it is um and to my knowledge cabin is not
[10981.26 → 10989.02] a like American English name yeah so i just kind of came up with something Sabine sabin
[10989.02 → 10994.86] I don't know sure um I've always is Edgar the king guy yeah it's always been cabin in my head so it
[10994.86 → 11001.42] depends on how you're asking if you mean just like you know character arc or if you mean battle fight
[11001.42 → 11013.10] prowess or if you mean like character design um i I was always more of an of like an Edgar guy but I think
[11013.10 → 11021.10] they both have limitations um and i and i i I like both of them i i like both of them the same
[11022.22 → 11028.30] i i i I'd say like character design you know obviously you know mog is awesome um
[11028.30 → 11036.62] um, um man I don't know they're all what's the dude's name I just got him in my party and this
[11036.62 → 11042.46] is probably going to tell you sort of where I'm at I'm like yeah he's cool yeah he's cool shadow's
[11042.46 → 11047.98] shadow's badass that was awesome it's like so cool like he's got like fang his dog yeah
[11047.98 → 11058.70] yeah he's got a dog doesn't like strangers he'll eat you leave him alone i uh as a kid i um you
[11058.70 → 11064.46] know my reading comprehension was not what it is today and when they do the introduction for shadow
[11064.46 → 11071.90] I misread it as he did slit his mama's throat for a nickel not that he would so I was like whoa
[11071.90 → 11073.10] dang
[11073.10 → 11082.70] dang oh man I was surprised when he joined the party well he doesn't always oh
[11084.30 → 11090.30] like I think you can proceed without him and that's like a thing with him so like
[11090.30 → 11098.06] like no spoilers but like watch out for that it's not a guarantee that shadow is in the party
[11098.06 → 11103.50] oh yeah I know he tells you he's like I might just leave at any time I was like oh yeah wow and it is
[11103.50 → 11111.26] is legitimately RNG sometimes and there was one point where he just off like there's a there's a segment
[11111.26 → 11119.26] at some point where he's with you, and he may leave at some time and he is just off after one random
[11119.26 → 11125.82] encounter and I had to go it without him for an extended period um that you're kind of supposed
[11125.82 → 11132.14] to kind of have him for part of it or something it was very inconvenient I just finished the there's
[11132.14 → 11140.54] this like actually insanely long rafting portion yep yeah the let's say river this is going to end now
[11140.54 → 11144.70] and then it's like pick a direction again you know why right no I know you have to make the right choice
[11144.70 → 11149.18] okay, okay yeah no i yeah for sure okay but i I still kept thinking that it would like
[11149.74 → 11156.30] actually end sooner than it did oh no and then like you get to the fight with ultras, and it's like
[11157.02 → 11161.74] you've kind of had the kicked out of you for kind of while and if you haven't stocked up items and
[11161.74 → 11165.82] that's another that's another fight where I keep going like all right this is a big hit this will take
[11165.82 → 11170.94] him down, and then it just keeps going I'm like oh my god oh no he's like he's a pain in the butt that early
[11170.94 → 11174.46] in the game yeah like he's well now I know you fight him again
[11179.02 → 11184.30] it's fine okay it's fine it's fine um but yeah I mean he doesn't die it's so i think the
[11184.30 → 11190.38] game it was pretty obvious implies it pretty heavily yeah yeah he has his own theme music that
[11190.38 → 11196.22] usually is an indication and a lot of dialogue and stuff like it's really involved it's pretty
[11196.22 → 11203.58] obvious don't tease the octopus kids yeah as a literal kid when I played it I was like oh
[11204.38 → 11211.34] I feel personally attacked right now I was that one spooked me because he like cleaved my entire
[11211.34 → 11217.34] party for over three quarters of their health and like dropped one of them from fairly healthy to dead
[11217.34 → 11223.26] and I was like oh this is a little scarier than I thought and then I realized how overpowered prey was
[11223.26 → 11230.94] and I was like oh okay I'm fine prey yeah one of the guys that you have like prey one of the
[11230.94 → 11240.30] oh Bannon yeah oh okay oh so you're playing the modern translation that move is just called health
[11241.42 → 11247.10] in the original translation I wasn't sure what it did so I almost didn't even want to use it
[11247.10 → 11250.54] oh that's hilarious and then I was like well I should figure it out because he doesn't do a lot of
[11250.54 → 11254.62] it doesn't do a ton of damage compared to my other characters anyway so let me try this
[11254.62 → 11260.22] and then it was just like make sure you're using your rows properly that's really important like
[11260.22 → 11266.14] at all that's really important so you throw Bannon in the back row just have him prey on every turn
[11266.14 → 11271.42] and then you're good and then same thing like even with that's one of the few oh I should have done
[11271.42 → 11276.14] that it tells you like Bannon can't go down I should have put him in the back I didn't even think about
[11276.14 → 11283.18] it yeah it's one of the few RPGs where um it actually makes sense to play around with your
[11283.18 → 11287.66] with your lineup even mid-fight sometimes like if you go oh I didn't know you could do this is bad
[11287.66 → 11294.38] I'm yeah so if you just click over or something like from the menu okay like with your d-pad yeah so
[11294.38 → 11299.02] you just go over, and it should there should be an option for a row I'm playing with keyboard and mouse
[11299.02 → 11304.62] okay we'll just use the arrow keys though and just go can I just can, I give you a SNES controller and
[11304.62 → 11311.02] an USB adapter I mean sure okay i i will do oh wait I need a ride tonight okay I will give
[11311.02 → 11317.90] it to you tonight sweet can I get a ride yeah thanks um so you just go over and then go row
[11317.90 → 11322.94] and it'll switch to the defensive position or it does use your turn which sucks yeah, but it might
[11322.94 → 11326.38] be worth it if you have somewhere where you're just like okay I'm going to switch you're you're on
[11326.38 → 11330.78] healer duty now, and you're only going to use magic um you need to actually get out of the way
[11330.78 → 11338.30] uh yeah it can be pretty useful yeah oh yeah how are you gonna how are you going to do uh cabin's
[11338.30 → 11345.26] blitzes on a keyboard I've I've done it work, but it's it was fine, and then they gave me an angled
[11345.26 → 11351.34] one and I was like yeah oh no, but you can do it I just did it okay there are ones that will be
[11351.34 → 11357.18] impossible okay yeah you will need a controller at some point okay yeah all right yeah I had like down
[11357.18 → 11362.14] left or something that I had to do and I just stared at it for a second was like oh no and then
[11362.14 → 11367.26] just tried to do it sync what's Ara bolt called because that's what that is
[11369.74 → 11377.82] the down left yeah I'm trying to remember diagonal left one uh I feel like Conrad's going to know um
[11377.82 → 11380.46] oh man oops I didn't mean to do that um
[11380.46 → 11387.50] that's okay it's not that I'm not going to remember I've only used it once okay because I saw the angle
[11387.50 → 11391.90] thing and I was like I don't really want to do that again what are you enjoying about the game um
[11393.98 → 11401.50] the story's like actually decently engaging I wasn't necessarily expecting that a ton really after all
[11401.50 → 11405.90] the time I've spent talking about it, you were like six I've played it like
[11405.90 → 11411.50] like man I've played it all the way to completion at least two or three times
[11412.06 → 11420.14] and I've played the first half over a dozen times like all the way into adulthood it is a great game
[11420.62 → 11428.94] i actually very much enjoy the graphics um i I am playing the pixel art remake so that might help
[11428.94 → 11434.46] it is a little bit but like the pixel art's good it's good it feels good it's it makes me
[11434.46 → 11445.10] kind of mad sometimes because like it just feels like a good game like within minutes of starting
[11445.10 → 11450.54] it up I was like yeah I want to play this like I actually want to play this right now I'm not just
[11450.54 → 11455.02] doing this because I want Linus to do other stuff like this is cool I'm engaged I want to go
[11455.02 → 11460.54] through this cave and find this thing and keep this chick alive and do whatever like I want to I want
[11460.54 → 11464.22] to actually do these activities that the game is trying to get me to do, and the graphics are
[11464.46 → 11470.46] good enough that they're interesting and like I'm i I know that a game is working for me when I start
[11470.46 → 11477.42] doing things naturally that are like the reason why I like Bethesda games like I started hunting in
[11477.42 → 11483.50] caves for secret passages yeah and enjoying that yeah and I was like all right I like this game I know
[11483.50 → 11488.62] when I start doing that type of stuff I'm like okay I'm engaged I care a lot yeah I want to find all
[11488.62 → 11493.26] the little secrets treasure matters type of stuff treasure does feel like it matters treasure
[11493.26 → 11498.54] actually matters I like that about games to that's huge it is so boring its one of the things that i
[11498.54 → 11504.38] hate about Zelda games yeah that every treasure chest unless it's at the centre of a dungeon is a
[11504.94 → 11511.66] rupee yeah like it is sucks yeah like I want there to be that's something that's um oh I'm back on
[11511.66 → 11519.42] fantasia again and that's something I do like about the game okay is that treasure matters there can be
[11519.42 → 11526.38] a random chest at any stage in the game like in the first dungeon, and it could be something that is
[11526.38 → 11532.06] impactful for the entire rest of the game like it unlocks part of it unlocks part of your like
[11532.06 → 11537.10] tech tree and there's no other way to unlock it like you actually need to explore you can find cool
[11537.10 → 11541.10] stuff by exploring something that I was going to say I do really like is that you're talking about
[11541.10 → 11547.34] how treasure matters I like that you have to use it I think that's cool i I am the type of person
[11547.34 → 11554.22] that will naturally be like oh a potion guess I'll never use this because I might need it someday and
[11554.22 → 11558.54] then I'll forget that I can even use them and then just beat the whole game, and it's just like whatever
[11558.54 → 11562.86] um but like you if you don't use them your team's just going to be dead all the time yeah so like you
[11562.86 → 11570.30] actually need to use your stuff and like the economy matters because having a tent or whatever
[11570.30 → 11576.38] is like actually pretty important at times I will say that it does fall into the same trap that most
[11576.38 → 11581.18] RPGs do in that the economy makes a ton of sense for the first like 10 hours, and then you just make
[11581.18 → 11586.14] too much and then and then it just sort of loses all semblance of that's one of the things that i just
[11586.14 → 11589.90] i I hate to come back to this again because I know it's such a sensitive topic, but that's something
[11589.90 → 11596.78] I loved so much about breath of the wild is the economy never scaled to ridiculous land where
[11596.78 → 11600.86] you're getting a hundred thousand rupees for every stupid random encounter, and you can afford all the
[11600.86 → 11607.34] armour in the game every piece of armour was like 500 rupees or whatever, and it was always difficult
[11607.90 → 11614.14] to raise 500 rupees of money not well not difficult, but it was always some like it what you didn't just
[11614.14 → 11619.18] have enough money to just buy everything because everything was constantly breaking just like in the real
[11619.18 → 11623.74] world where you were always buying stuff and always treasure hunting it always mattered it
[11623.74 → 11630.30] was always important I did I I also found out negatively but I'm okay with that I want to be
[11630.30 → 11637.26] very clear um recently that you need to kind of do the things now uh or the game might take that
[11637.26 → 11645.50] opportunity away from you um I got to a town that felt huge south Figaro or whatever it's called
[11645.50 → 11650.38] um it felt pretty big and established and I was like okay I'll come back here later yeah no you
[11650.38 → 11655.74] won't yeah and there was like some dude that like wouldn't talk to me unless I gave him alcohol or
[11655.74 → 11661.34] something cider yeah yeah and I was like I think i kind of figured I want to progress the game though
[11661.34 → 11667.98] I'll like to come back and do this later, and then it's like literally the next thing that happens is they're
[11667.98 → 11675.10] like that place doesn't exist anymore I'm just like okay I guess I won't go do that thing um all right
[11675.10 → 11679.42] and I'm like trying to actually do all the content I just didn't think they were going to delete
[11679.42 → 11684.46] the like what third city at this point it's like everywhere I go they're just like you're never going
[11684.46 → 11690.94] back there again empire's up man yeah like yeah yeah you have to do something about it, and you know
[11690.94 → 11696.86] what yeah, but that's the thing is like i I like that they establish real stakes like it's not just I care
[11696.86 → 11706.86] there's an ambiguous motive for someone to something because whatever like it it's its really
[11706.86 → 11714.38] grounded there's a there's a there's an empire that is like actually doing like burning down cities and
[11714.38 → 11721.02] just wrecking everything and all in the name of you know conquest and acquisition and it feels
[11721.02 → 11726.46] I don't know it feels very on the one hand like a global conflict but they on the other hand they make
[11726.46 → 11732.30] it is really personal yeah this place that you visited now it's gone, and you were a slave yes to them yes
[11733.34 → 11738.46] what are you going to do about it yeah it's uh yeah I don't know it's cool i I love it i I can't believe
[11738.46 → 11743.10] you haven't mentioned the music I love the music's very good music's very good however I haven't
[11743.10 → 11748.62] heard the redone tracks for the pixel remaster it's good would you be enjoying it as much if the graphics
[11748.62 → 11756.38] looked like that yeah absolutely okay yeah no seriously though that's
[11756.38 → 11762.30] my Tara that's yeah wait I don't think I have this person yet not that that's a problem no she's the
[11762.30 → 11770.94] main character oh her name's Tara oh what's her name I think I accidentally rewrote it I didn't do that
[11770.94 → 11778.54] to anyone else I didn't do that to anybody else all right fine yeah yeah that's Tara yeah I didn't want
[11778.54 → 11785.02] to rewrite it to be clear um what was I going to say uh yeah I don't I don't mind I don't mind pixel
[11785.02 → 11792.78] graphics I don't know i I am appreciative of art styles not necessarily just fidelity oh apparently
[11792.78 → 11798.38] I had the wrong one apparently that was not the pixel remaster graphics so does she look more similar
[11798.38 → 11805.82] to the one on the far left does actually yeah hold on what's this is this it I feel like that's what I'm looking at
[11805.82 → 11815.10] okay yeah like the dude lock or lucky or whatever yeah he looks like the one the third one
[11815.10 → 11821.58] I think this one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's him yeah I think it looks cool
[11821.58 → 11827.42] i actually kind of i actually kind of like his old uh bulkier look yeah he looks kind of inner here
[11828.22 → 11835.90] yeah definitely more like kind of swashbuckling thief and less just like fits the theme but um yeah i
[11835.90 → 11840.54] also don't know what's up with these super, super pointy shoes was that really the intent no idea
[11841.90 → 11845.74] might have been easier it might be an asset oh no this is the new one I don't know I was going to say on
[11845.74 → 11850.70] the old one it might be an asset they use for something else as well so they save data um the only thing
[11850.70 → 11856.46] I don't like so far genuinely like whatever criticism you're going to have there's no way i
[11856.46 → 11861.50] can accept it yeah that's fine it's a perfect game no it's not perfect the only thing I don't like is i
[11861.50 → 11866.62] I have very little experience with Final Fantasy games I don't remember Final Fantasy 8 working this
[11866.62 → 11872.30] way but I haven't played it since I was like 12 so maybe it did I don't know um but the turn system
[11872.30 → 11879.66] I hate it like a lot I have it set to wait actions are still happening in the background while I'm
[11879.66 → 11884.14] trying to select things so yeah get good doesn't seem to be happening yeah get good I think even
[11884.14 → 11890.14] wait doesn't wait much oh it like ends up resuming anyway so what it what weight will do I think that's
[11890.14 → 11895.58] a bad system I forget what I forget what the distinction is so active means that everyone's turn
[11895.58 → 11903.26] counters are running all the time um and then wait I think what it does is if they act they will
[11903.26 → 11907.74] wait for you to finish their turn before it starts to count again, but that doesn't mean they can't
[11907.74 → 11912.94] act if they had already reached the end of their active time battle it's its called ATB and
[11912.94 → 11920.14] there's i I should give you the manual I have my manual from when I was like to this was again this
[11920.14 → 11924.46] is a sign that I actually cared about the game yeah I went into the adventurers' guild thing near the
[11924.46 → 11928.94] beginning of the game and I actually talked to everyone and like learned these things nice and I decided
[11928.94 → 11936.14] to put it on weight um but it is doesn't yeah it doesn't actually like pause the game and I don't
[11936.14 → 11943.58] find sorting through menus quickly to be a skill that I care about um and also I've been really
[11943.58 → 11950.62] enjoying it as like a side monitor game so I'll leave it there and be doing something else for a
[11950.62 → 11955.82] while maybe I'm talking to Emma maybe I'm playing with the birds maybe I'm I don't know anything maybe
[11955.82 → 11961.18] playing another game sometimes even I'll just leave it on the side monitor and then I'll play for a little
[11961.18 → 11967.02] bit and then get distracted by something else, and it's fine whatever but now i I can't ever pause
[11967.58 → 11972.14] really you can pause maybe there's a way maybe there's a specific pause but I want to be able to
[11972.14 → 11976.62] just stop oh yeah no start button just pauses the battle okay and it just stops I don't know
[11976.62 → 11980.14] what that is maybe escape or something okay I'll give you a controller tonight and I'm going to give
[11980.14 → 11984.14] you my manual you'd like if it's full of like artwork and stuff cool like it's actually awesome I used to
[11984.14 → 11990.06] really like old manuals yeah probably will like it yeah um oh no Luke wants an idle Final Fantasy
[11990.06 → 11995.10] game no that's not what he's asking for no, no no, no I don't want it to play while it's sitting there
[11995.10 → 12000.70] my whole point is I want it to pause like something that I really like about slay this buyer and ft
[12000.70 → 12003.98] and maybe now that I know you can pause in combat if you press a button it'll be the same thing as ft
[12003.98 → 12008.14] yeah because in ft you just press space bar and the whole game pauses so it's great for a side
[12008.14 → 12013.66] one you can leave it for two days yeah no you can pause if it's okay great yeah, yeah so that should don't you
[12013.66 → 12019.18] worry help that but I still wish it was just turn-based apparently it's while you are in a
[12019.18 → 12025.18] sub menu so it's so that you don't have to like quickly navigate to which magic spell you want to
[12025.18 → 12030.30] cast maybe I'm using it wrong or maybe I switched it back off of weight and don't remember that but i
[12030.30 → 12037.98] was in sub i was like selecting spells on whatever her name is um tara and actions were happening in
[12037.98 → 12041.42] the background I was trying to i was trying to like to read the descriptions of what the spells did
[12041.42 → 12049.58] and the game's just playing itself I'm like bro stop I can tell you what they do fire casts fire
[12049.58 → 12055.58] I figured that one out cure casts cure yeah but I wasn't sure what scan I don't know what scan
[12055.58 → 12065.42] is oh uh uh uh shoot what's um the other translation of it or crap uh I have like four spells with her or something right now
[12065.42 → 12072.54] now characteristics of enemies uh what's it called ah it's escaping me
[12074.62 → 12082.70] uh crap and where do you see your mp when you're in battle I don't remember I only see your health
[12083.50 → 12087.34] and then there's this like other number beside it, but it doesn't seem to change when I cast spells so
[12087.34 → 12092.86] libra is scan okay hold on what's her what's her I don't know if I have that spell I don't have
[12092.86 → 12097.42] ice, yet someone just said ice I don't have that ice is way later for Tara yeah very natural that i
[12097.42 → 12101.58] would get I'm not worried about that as a spoiler but I don't have that yet yeah no, no no that's that's
[12101.58 → 12107.90] not yeah no she's she's a she's a natural magic user so she'll just like to learn spells um
[12109.18 → 12113.42] man I don't I don't remember the I don't remember the order I don't remember the fourth spell she gets
[12113.42 → 12122.54] oh antidote yeah, yeah so that's the like there's so many different status things oh my god
[12122.94 → 12129.10] like there's a blind or something yeah couldn't figure out what would stop that really so i just
[12129.10 → 12135.02] had to rest what yeah uh eye drops I don't think I have any maybe that's why I couldn't yeah that's
[12135.02 → 12139.02] your problem yeah yeah you should get some I didn't have anything that would solve it there's
[12139.02 → 12144.62] a cure-all item, but you can't buy it hyper expensive you can never buy it so be really careful with
[12144.62 → 12148.22] that one okay yeah I think it's called remedy or something like that I was kind of surprised you
[12148.22 → 12156.14] could buy phoenix downs uh you'll go down a lot so I'm really glad that you can buy phoenix downs okay
[12156.14 → 12160.62] so far I've only used two yeah okay but I have had to use well I was six
[12162.70 → 12168.86] one of mine was I I just told you it was the octopus guy yeah all my people were fairly healthy
[12168.86 → 12175.02] yeah, and they just bonk I'm like oh okay yeah when he does tentacle once, and it like takes down one of
[12175.02 → 12178.86] your guys, and you're like oh i have to watch out for this, and then it turns out he can multicast it
[12181.18 → 12185.90] you're like oh really yeah no that's what happened to me yeah I know all four of them at the same time
[12185.90 → 12191.66] and I was like oh yeah, and it's I don't think he had done it once yet oh really he just yeah
[12191.66 → 12196.86] because no one had taken any noticeable damage and then just got one single target one hits ever so
[12196.86 → 12203.18] slightly harder but the four target one still hits really hard yeah it's pretty brutal it's kind of
[12203.18 → 12208.86] nuts anyway it's a great game I love that game and uh now that you're playing it I'll probably play
[12208.86 → 12212.94] it again but i sure hope you got the sprint shoes I have like multiple pairs of that I just don't
[12212.94 → 12218.22] have eye drops I just looted them I didn't buy you'll need one pair of sprint shoes I didn't buy them
[12218.22 → 12223.26] oh, oh you just found them okay fair enough all right I think I bought the first pair and then i
[12223.26 → 12227.58] found more or something I don't know but I have multiple pairs hit me Dan sure yeah we got lots of
[12227.58 → 12234.78] potentials too hey LLD hello from Michigan what do you think has been the most detrimental to gaming
[12234.78 → 12243.02] games as a service microtransactions or loot boxes oh wow two things are well no not no you could you
[12243.02 → 12247.58] could have one without the other you could have loot boxes without microtransactions yeah it's like
[12247.58 → 12252.38] square and rectangle yeah you could have expensive boxes that wouldn't be micro
[12252.38 → 12261.26] I'm not doing it don't look at him, you could definitely have games as a service without
[12261.26 → 12265.10] microtransactions though or games as a service without loot boxes or I think they're without
[12265.10 → 12271.02] games they're definitely separate yeah um out of all of those things I do not think games as a service is
[12271.02 → 12277.50] the worst one no I think games as a service is probably the most palatable in terms of uh predictable
[12277.50 → 12282.06] recurring revenue for developers without being completely predatory I don't like it I think it's
[12282.06 → 12288.30] kind of bad thing but out of the current options I think it's the least of the evils
[12289.10 → 12295.42] microtransactions versus uh loot boxes I actually agree with the argument here I think loot boxes are
[12295.42 → 12301.90] a subset of microtransactions and I do think they are a worse a worker I also agree with that
[12304.06 → 12311.74] theoretical handshakes yeah yeah I'm satisfied because I mean loot boxes are just microtransactions with
[12311.74 → 12318.54] gambling you know what I take it back gambling makes everything better let's go to kick
[12319.90 → 12326.78] rescinded handshake hello LLD do you have any opinions on the popularity of hardcore gaming
[12326.78 → 12331.98] and players willingness to risk everything okay I think I curated this I have no idea what this means
[12331.98 → 12339.58] yeah i potential this yeah no I can't believe I didn't get this uh there's like uh I think it's in
[12339.58 → 12346.54] RuneScape I know it's in oh like realism mode kind of thing like if you die your character's dead yeah
[12347.26 → 12352.46] that makes so much more sense I think it's cool why not it's an interesting twist something you
[12352.46 → 12358.46] don't have to play it no one's making you that'd be a fascinating MMO that's a thing like all the
[12358.46 → 12364.54] way back to level zero RuneScape and wow your character dies its dead what's called yeah 100
[12364.54 → 12369.42] is it hard mode or is if it's called hardcore and wow yeah I think it's called Iron Man and RuneScape
[12369.42 → 12375.34] yeah Iron Man wow okay yeah yeah that rings a bell, and you think about some of the mechanics in a game
[12375.34 → 12383.66] like wow that are just they'll just kill you, and it's like okay is there PVP in like uh so in the
[12383.66 → 12393.34] World of Warcraft version uh there's something called mock Goa where like you can duel in hardcore
[12394.14 → 12399.58] but in a traditional duel you never actually die it ends when someone gets to one hp and then all
[12399.58 → 12404.38] their rebuffs and everything are cleared, and the duel ends no one actually dies someone has to like
[12404.94 → 12412.78] be forcibly forfeited basically um if you mock Goa you have to go through a bunch of I've never done it
[12412.78 → 12417.90] I don't know, but you have to like to accept it a few times or something like you have if it's very clear
[12417.90 → 12423.42] to the user that you're agreeing to this thing, and it's a duel to the death and if you kill the person
[12423.42 → 12427.34] you get like a permanent buff or something that says that you've actually like murdered someone
[12430.62 → 12436.78] I think let me look it up I like that a lot because you kind of your kind of did wow hardcore
[12436.78 → 12439.02] um
[12442.70 → 12448.14] okay this is not people have called events the same thing so it's not the easiest thing to like find
[12448.14 → 12455.42] details on apparently there's a hardcore mode in Diablo the first thousand players get their name on
[12455.42 → 12457.34] an in-game statute for Diablo 4
[12464.22 → 12469.26] in RuneScape not only is there a permanent, but you can't trade or receive items from other players
[12469.26 → 12476.46] in hardcore Iron Man so wow has that as well, but it's a community add-on that enforces the restriction
[12476.46 → 12486.14] it's not wow that enforces the restriction and in my view of it if you don't play with the add-on
[12486.14 → 12495.58] you're playing a fake to version because being able to just but okay so every MMO has this issue eve
[12495.58 → 12503.34] I'm sure RuneScape has it I know wow has it everything people just buy gold if you can buy gold you can buy
[12503.34 → 12512.38] items if you can buy items you can buy with real world dollars effectively skill um and in a hardcore
[12512.38 → 12517.66] situation a very significant advantage compared to everyone else around you so if you're just going
[12517.66 → 12522.30] around buying all the items you can possibly buy to be way stronger than you're supposed to be are you
[12522.30 → 12528.22] really playing hardcore and like the whole reason like I play with my brother the whole reason why
[12528.22 → 12533.90] we like playing it I haven't played in a while, but theoretically we play um the whole reason why we
[12533.90 → 12540.70] like playing is because it like forces you to go slower you play together so we play in a duo
[12540.70 → 12547.26] so we can trade with each other, but we can't trade with anyone else so like our professions really matter
[12547.26 → 12551.82] because now we're like making things that we can use we can't get these things from other people
[12552.30 → 12556.54] you only have a fixed amount of professions you can even take so we had to be like strategic about
[12556.54 → 12561.18] what professions each one of us was going to take so we can benefit each other the most possible way
[12561.18 → 12565.10] like there's all this like you have to pay attention all these subsystems so much more
[12565.74 → 12571.18] it makes like any random encounter super tense because oh what if you miss three or four times in
[12571.18 → 12577.02] a row and the random boar you're fighting crits you three or four times in a row well you're going to be
[12577.02 → 12581.90] freaking out because if you screw up if this keeps going poorly your character is going to get deleted
[12582.94 → 12584.46] so yeah it's interesting
[12587.90 → 12592.70] yeah I can't find the actual details on like what the buff that you get is or anything else like that
[12593.90 → 12597.34] I think it's cool that they have the system in the game I don't think I'd ever do it but
[12597.82 → 12601.26] there's a 100 000 hardcore tournament ongoing
[12601.26 → 12605.50] that's awesome wow
[12611.82 → 12617.82] people got to be level 60 and streamers legit logging in getting carried
[12617.82 → 12623.18] through people giving them gold and gear so they can get into the tournament yeah like that doesn't
[12623.82 → 12627.34] feel like hardcore to me get the add-on play it for real
[12630.78 → 12631.26] anyway
[12631.26 → 12638.86] with the Unreal Engine promoting AI powered smart NPCs in future games should GPU testing now include
[12638.86 → 12645.42] an AI benchmarking suite like Stable Diffusion for generic a2a comparison absolutely, but it's going to
[12645.42 → 12654.06] take us some time to come up with meaningful benchmarks um as they pertain to gaming Linus do you keep any
[12654.06 → 12659.58] backup computers at home I would go crazy if I had to fix my computer on the regular you're crazy
[12659.58 → 12665.66] I think we talked about this recently Luke did I ask you to guess how many computers I have in my house
[12666.46 → 12668.22] no okay
[12669.18 → 12670.78] guess how many computers I have in my house
[12670.78 → 12680.54] what okay so are we are these pcs like are you counting servers they run windows okay
[12684.22 → 12685.42] are you counting VMS
[12688.70 → 12693.82] anything capable anything currently running a VM counts as one okay fair enough
[12693.82 → 12704.70] 25 25 25 I don't actually know okay um
[12707.74 → 12715.90] so lets uh let's see mine and Yvonne's office machines okay there's a little like uh thin client
[12715.90 → 12720.22] in the family room upstairs that I haven't actually really used I just like got it to kind of tinker
[12720.22 → 12726.54] with if it's there if it runs windows accounts um does it count if it leaves the house sometimes
[12726.54 → 12733.90] see I wasn't sure about this I included in my crappy brain math your uh the Asus thing that you have
[12733.90 → 12738.06] oh okay oh I didn't even think of that I meant like the four gaming laptops in the van
[12738.86 → 12745.90] oh I didn't think of those I think those count seven darn it um okay, so then there's the five in the
[12745.90 → 12751.98] land centre yeah so we're up to 12 there are five laptops in the land centre that I haven't removed
[12751.98 → 12756.22] yet so we're up to 17 I actually did count both of those because I was pretty sure that was true
[12756.94 → 12768.86] um there's the play button pc 18 there's my two flow x13s my old one and my new one that I need to
[12768.86 → 12772.86] transfer everything onto and my framework so sorry what are we up to
[12772.86 → 12778.78] I think that's 21 is that 20 I think that's 20. I think I was at 17. oh, I thought you're at 18. Oh
[12778.78 → 12784.14] wait no oh no yeah 18 because I play button pc was 18 I think okay right okay so that's 21.
[12785.02 → 12789.82] there's Yvonne's laptop so that's 22. I already got obliterated because he hasn't even got to the
[12789.82 → 12796.46] server room uh oh right yeah server room so in the server room there's um do I count a test bench
[12796.46 → 12805.74] it works right now yeah okay so 23. Three are we at 22 I can't even I have no ram um we were at 21
[12805.74 → 12814.38] with the laptops okay well 22 or 23 one of the two sure uh and then there's the NVMe server so 20
[12814.38 → 12821.74] let's say 23 then there's the hard drive server 24 and then there's um
[12821.74 → 12826.38] um yeah if you can only find one more I'm a god
[12829.50 → 12833.74] what why well I said 25. Did you I think so oh okay I'll try and find one more for oh right
[12833.74 → 12842.46] right uh ally hey 25 um now you have to find zero more do laptops count yeah yeah we counted okay good
[12842.46 → 12848.86] yeah um well okay does it count does it count if it's in my house right now but on its way out
[12848.86 → 12856.06] like it's on a rack to load into my car how long was it at your house a year was this like a fairly
[12856.06 → 12859.34] permanent fixture like this is your thing it's my old ally my into
[12863.58 → 12870.06] I want to say no because I want to be right but I think that counts okay, okay so 26 yeah um there's
[12870.06 → 12875.34] probably another computer in there, but that was like a media centre pc in the at the downstairs TV
[12875.34 → 12881.50] no so i I have the I have the fibre optic HDMI working great now so I just like plunk it into my
[12881.50 → 12885.42] computer I just use my computer from in there or I had the play button pc in there for a while
[12885.42 → 12890.14] but then yeah I just got bored with dealing with that um because it's no it works great now
[12891.50 → 12896.30] right you had to update it for whale land or whatever yeah, but it has a thunderbolt GPU um and so
[12896.30 → 12898.94] the performance isn't as good and I'm kind of sitting here going well what I'm just
[12899.90 → 12903.50] yeah plug in a HDMI cable yeah anyway you might as well yeah I might as well have like the
[12903.50 → 12909.90] performance of a 7900 ATX if I'm going to be gaming at 4k 120? Um so yeah it's awesome
[12911.26 → 12916.78] so 2026 so in response it's not sorry I wasn't like showing off or anything you asked if i why I don't
[12916.78 → 12922.78] have a spare computer and the answer is I definitely have a spare computer i will typically just plug in
[12922.78 → 12930.14] an um and our uh flow x13 to be fair if is you did is my computer's down car content, and you didn't
[12930.14 → 12934.62] have a ton of cars at home it would be really weird yeah well see that's the thing right I'm always I'm
[12934.62 → 12938.86] always trying stuff I'm always playing around with stuff like I can only use one computer at a time
[12938.86 → 12946.70] but sometimes oh I forgot about the VR pc 27 um like I'm not going to move my computer around every time i
[12946.70 → 12952.14] actually did a review of a VR headset recently the big screen beyond like what I'm going to like cart my
[12952.14 → 12956.62] computer and no, no no, no no, no like I actually do this for a living so it's um it's just a bit of
[12956.62 → 12963.74] a different calculus yeah is that you Dan that said you're at six yeah I think it's six or something
[12963.74 → 12970.38] like that wow plus laptops I feel so not with it, I'm at we don't count the IMAX otherwise I'd have
[12970.38 → 12976.46] more than Linus I want to I want a fourth but no one has told me that I can buy the wood accent parts yet
[12976.46 → 12984.62] if I can, I'll have a fourth but I know I'm not going to butt the line or anything I'm waiting I'm
[12984.62 → 12991.18] uh I'm downsizing soon there's a couple that need to get sold all right sorry what's what's next
[12991.18 → 12998.38] Luke I know you have challenges with dyslexia god I hope I spelled that right uh what about spoonerism
[12998.38 → 13004.54] that's one I discovered that's a thing recently what did you know the term spoonerism I didn't know
[13004.54 → 13011.18] reversal of the initial letters or syllables of two or more words I have a half warmed fish in my
[13011.18 → 13019.90] mind for half formed wish ah a blushing crow for a crushing blow isn't this just like a symptom of
[13019.90 → 13030.38] dyslexia and doesn't to a certain degree just like everybody do that or is that just me normalizing my
[13030.38 → 13037.98] own stuff no I mean i do it verbally, verbally yeah I would
[13040.54 → 13044.62] like I'll do it verbally by accident but I don't think I would ever read it by accident I don't know
[13044.62 → 13049.90] if this would even still be a problem because I like never write things, but there was a
[13049.90 → 13054.86] time in high school I swear I wasn't doing it on purpose where I would write words and I'd like
[13054.86 → 13059.66] leave I wouldn't even I wouldn't have to think about it but I'd like leave one of the letters blank and then
[13059.66 → 13065.42] go back and put it I have no idea what the heck was going on with that not a clue that i that might
[13065.42 → 13071.50] be completely unrelated I have no idea that was very odd someone's I didn't even know that I did
[13071.50 → 13077.02] its someone saw me do it once and I was like wait yeah what's going on I have super weird issues yeah
[13077.02 → 13082.62] spelling I haven't had that happen to me at all in years but I don't write that often anymore but I was I
[13082.62 → 13088.38] mean I was taking notes in the gym and stuff and that never happened so I don't know maybe i just
[13088.38 → 13095.34] stopped doing weird things is your spelling okay no because what I'll do is I'll like at the top of
[13095.34 → 13101.18] the page I'll spell the word wrong didn't roast me right there oh I wasn't listening yeah ask again
[13102.06 → 13106.30] neither of us can spell very well yeah he was like is your spelling okay and I was like no
[13106.30 → 13114.62] spelling matters well I'm I don't think it doesn't matter i just can't do it consistently
[13114.62 → 13120.14] I'll be writing a page and I'll not know how to spell a word at the top and then like two sentences
[13120.14 → 13125.02] later I'll know how to spell the word did I ever tell you about uh in grade I think it was grade one
[13125.02 → 13128.86] uh when my teacher held me back for recess and I had to break out of the classroom because I couldn't
[13128.86 → 13134.54] spell a certain word she didn't believe that I couldn't spell it but I genuinely like had no idea i
[13134.54 → 13140.46] don't remember what the I think it was like library or something um and that are I remembered
[13140.46 → 13146.06] that one it was on some of our uniforms I went to a private school it was like a private Christian
[13146.06 → 13153.66] school um but yeah some of our uniforms had that word on it, I think it was like I don't remember but
[13153.66 → 13157.82] yeah some of the uniforms had the word on it but not the one that I was wearing so like she was like
[13157.82 → 13162.70] you can't come out of the classroom, but she laughed, but she like I think she locked the door or
[13162.70 → 13166.14] something I don't think you're allowed to do that this was a private Christian school they can do what
[13166.14 → 13171.66] the heck they want um so I crawled out of one of the windows and found a kid that had the right
[13171.66 → 13177.82] uniform on memorized how to spell it really quick ran back inside and then flubbed it anyway wrote it
[13177.82 → 13184.38] down did get it right, and then it's like bashed on the door until she came back, and then she just like
[13184.38 → 13191.50] looked at me really weird and was like I guess you can go and then I went and hung out for recess and
[13191.50 → 13198.06] I just like this has been a problem forever is my point this is not like a new thing
[13200.54 → 13203.98] I don't think it was school I don't think it was school I don't remember what it was
[13205.50 → 13210.70] how much power does it take to run the pool loop how many computers would it need to cool to break
[13210.70 → 13219.02] even with the running costs' oh that's a good question um not that much I mean each of those pumps is
[13219.02 → 13224.78] probably like 20 30 watts or something like that but as long as it's dumping more than that amount
[13224.78 → 13233.42] of heat into the pool which I'm very certain that it is the oh uh no, no spoilers there's going to be a
[13233.42 → 13239.90] video where I demonstrate that we're definitely dumping heat into the pool um did you ever figure
[13239.90 → 13247.34] out the one loop no oh, but it works perfectly now so after you and I like looked at it so I think it
[13247.34 → 13253.26] was an airlock or something like that probably worked it out and we yeah we buy by by blocking off the one
[13253.26 → 13262.38] yeah they both blow freezing air now, and it's awesome nice um so that video is coming anywho um
[13263.18 → 13271.26] yeah it's definitely worth it with even just the systems that are on it now but from like uh from
[13271.26 → 13276.54] like a purely you know pure cost perspective no I'd no I'd be way better off just dumping the air into
[13276.54 → 13281.42] my house and then using a heat pump which is way more efficient than like any kind of resistive heater
[13281.42 → 13288.06] or anything to just uh or heat pump to do the cooling it doesn't matter the point is no it makes no sense
[13288.06 → 13293.02] and yes that's okay there that's what I'm trying to say I'm stunned I have so many funny stories from
[13293.02 → 13299.90] this school I was only there for like three years um I'm stunned they're still around they were a very
[13299.90 → 13306.06] small like in the absolute boonies school I remember one time i was super pissed when I came home
[13306.06 → 13314.14] because there was a creek that ran along like one of the sides of this school um, and we would race like
[13314.86 → 13320.14] little boats that we would make in the creek and I was like playing with my boat while I was in
[13320.14 → 13326.06] class and the teachers took it from me and I was like i I thought it was like theft like I was pissed
[13327.66 → 13330.22] complaining to my parents and my parents just being like um
[13331.26 → 13334.54] you shouldn't have played with it in class and I was like what do you mean she stole from me
[13335.18 → 13340.22] this is not okay yeah doesn't the bible say something about that yeah like what are you talking about
[13340.22 → 13348.22] it's like you're like five so it's like one of the most important things to you, you've like ever had
[13349.50 → 13358.38] it's like whatever I don't know it's funny um next one hello Dan and his merry men
[13360.78 → 13364.86] are there any employees that you feel deserve more recognition but aren't in a role where they would
[13364.86 → 13372.06] typically be in the spotlight yes please rerun the uncle Linus bottle like all the developers yeah i
[13372.06 → 13379.82] mean man like even Yvonne is a perfect example of someone that I have to go out of my way to make
[13379.82 → 13385.42] it so that people have any idea that she does anything here um and people just the number of times
[13385.42 → 13393.74] I've seen it assumed that she's the boss's wife which is just yeah so reductive is that a word i
[13393.74 → 13404.54] hope it's a word it is to me yeah but everything's a word to you um present a subject or problem in a
[13404.54 → 13409.90] simplified form especially one viewed as crude you know what I'm going with it um yeah it's its just
[13409.90 → 13416.30] it's so it's so dismissive and disrespectful, and honestly it's its a problem that everyone other
[13416.30 → 13420.86] than the people on camera have it's one of the reasons I go out of my way to you know thank the
[13420.86 → 13426.22] team and talk about how we did something the problem is that sometimes that's not necessarily good
[13426.22 → 13432.62] for business people like having a know a personality they relate to they like things feeling
[13432.62 → 13438.78] personal and so you know we've tried we've played around with it a lot of times when I put we did x in
[13438.78 → 13448.46] the title of the video versus I wasted 500 on why I even just thinking right now that's more clickable
[13448.46 → 13453.26] for sure of course it is yeah and so it's its a challenge right because in order to do the right
[13453.26 → 13460.38] thing for the team sometimes I have to take the narcissistic path right which is like
[13460.38 → 13472.06] I don't know what to tell you all these pressures to not do it and then the algorithm's
[13472.06 → 13478.94] just like yes yeah I don't make the rules it's not even the algorithm remember you can understand the
[13478.94 → 13484.30] platform so much better if you replace the word algorithm with audience yeah yeah the audience chooses
[13484.30 → 13490.70] the audience clicks what it clicks I don't make the rules they're the boss man yeah so yeah no I mean
[13492.14 → 13497.42] yeah like everyone has logistics entire departments of people who get no recognition at all but yeah we
[13497.42 → 13503.90] you know we need them to function i have old school members of the team that are like
[13506.38 → 13510.70] yeah pillars of the community have worked here for a long time I don't know if they've ever been on camera
[13510.70 → 13522.54] because as i think I know Jayden is in like a Ltd exclusive at the very least
[13523.42 → 13528.70] and I know he's in the background of some video from like forever ago but I don't I don't know if
[13528.70 → 13533.34] he's been in anything more recently I don't really think so I don't know if AJ's ever been on camera
[13534.46 → 13540.30] AJ's been here since like 2016 or something yeah he's never been on camera that's crazy
[13540.70 → 13545.02] like they're there yeah I have a lot of examples from the dev teams um
[13547.18 → 13556.54] mastery asks who get the most praise and recognition me, but there's another edge on that sword
[13556.54 → 13564.94] yeah yeah also gets pretty sharp too everything else yeah when something goes wrong I'm damned if I do
[13564.94 → 13570.30] I'm damned if I don't if I tell the true story that it was actually someone else's fault I had nothing to
[13570.30 → 13574.62] do with it and no way to prevent it than I'm throwing my team under the bus yeah and if I accept
[13574.62 → 13579.74] the responsibility and I do the adult thing then I'm an incompetent wit so I can't win
[13582.14 → 13583.26] I've tried it both ways
[13585.58 → 13585.82] yeah
[13585.82 → 13597.02] hi Linus you are rich and frugal is this written by you yeah yeah what are you doing with all your
[13597.02 → 13604.22] excess money Bill Gates didn't leave any for his children what are you doing with your excess who the
[13604.22 → 13616.54] curated this not me actually that's me hey um well building stuff yeah i i I okay we have a lot of revenue
[13617.10 → 13622.94] we um our revenue is greater than our costs, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we're not doing
[13622.94 → 13629.66] things with it um I would say everything from wise investments for the future
[13629.66 → 13636.14] um just in case things go sideways to uh building future business opportunities so we can continue
[13636.14 → 13642.62] to grow and provide opportunities for upward mobility for our team to um you know i finally over the last
[13642.62 → 13648.14] few years started just blowing some of it on myself I live in a nicer house now I drive a pretty okay car
[13648.14 → 13655.66] um it's its pretty okay holly debated yeah it's its pretty okay I mean there's people here who wouldn't
[13655.66 → 13659.58] who wouldn't take one for free because they're petrol heads or whatever but like you know
[13660.70 → 13666.30] I think it's pretty okay um I'd take one for free and I'm building a badminton centre I'd probably sell
[13666.30 → 13672.22] it I'd 100 percent sell it yeah there's no way you wouldn't even know if I'd drive it really
[13672.22 → 13677.02] not even once just in case like brakes or something or like yeah I mean that's fair it's broken a couple
[13677.02 → 13683.26] times already yeah um through no did you know Ivan curbed it is that what happened to the rim or
[13683.26 → 13688.46] something yeah yeah someone shouldn't sort of picture I was so unhappy anyway um unfortunate
[13688.46 → 13693.42] yeah those are probably really expensive you know what's hilarious is my you know what's crazy
[13694.70 → 13697.26] what if you do that in my car like wouldn't matter at all oh yeah
[13699.26 → 13701.02] the wheels would get shinier the value would go up
[13702.94 → 13708.30] so my grandfather um was in the hospital uh self-repairing uh a couple of weeks ago
[13708.30 → 13716.06] and we went to visit him, and he made kind of an um kind of misogynistic joke about whether
[13716.06 → 13722.86] I let Ivan drive my car oh boy and I know he was joking because he's not like that okay, but you know
[13722.86 → 13729.26] I'm still going to make sure that i you know okay the follow-up of this even if it is a joke or not
[13729.26 → 13736.94] play this hand correctly is that it is our car yep that was purchased with our money um, and it would be
[13736.94 → 13743.82] ridiculous for me to restrict or otherwise try to dictate Ivan's access to a shared vehicle that
[13743.82 → 13750.62] we both paid for um and uh you know because it was also kind of so it was a joke about you know
[13751.58 → 13758.14] pants wearing in the relationship but also the old stereotype of uh of bad women drivers right like
[13758.14 → 13763.98] it was it was kind of a was a two-pronged joke that like he's like 80 something like
[13763.98 → 13771.98] chill like i he sometimes old people say stuff that is you know not in line with modern sensibilities
[13771.98 → 13776.86] and we all we that's part of being accepting sometimes is accepting that some people don't
[13776.86 → 13781.50] have the same acceptance as you and just yeah they're not going to be here much longer so it doesn't matter
[13782.06 → 13792.30] just chill it's okay yeah um anyway so I said all of that and um and he's like um but aren't you
[13792.30 → 13796.70] worried she's going to wreck it and I was like no she's actually a perfect driver blah blah blah
[13796.70 → 13803.42] don't forget Ivan's also Asian so they're not racist yeah I actually promise you that but like
[13803.42 → 13810.94] that doesn't mean they don't make off-colour jokes sometimes and so um Ivan left to go to hell of a
[13810.94 → 13817.50] thing yeah Ivan left to go get um like my sister and my kids because they hadn't come right away um just
[13817.50 → 13823.02] in case his condition was like upsetting to the kids or something but like I had to talk him into
[13823.02 → 13827.66] letting the grandkids come uh so that they could see him um and I was like no you don't look
[13827.66 → 13833.98] that bad I think it's okay and so, so anyway Ivan went to go get everyone walked in and was like i
[13833.98 → 13847.34] curbed the car oh right after that interaction oh man oh Geez oh man i uh I ran the poll in
[13847.34 → 13852.78] flow plane chat uh would you rather have one of Linus's Taiwan or 25 of Luke's auras
[13852.78 → 13859.42] okay hold on a second you couldn't afford 20 you could oh
[13862.38 → 13866.94] nick uh nick sent me some all capitals team's message to remind us about that
[13868.38 → 13873.18] you actually get it's pretty split actually yeah you do have to remember that my car is a little
[13873.18 → 13878.38] old yeah how are you going to drive 25 auras at once no we thought that's through last forever so
[13878.38 → 13883.58] dance theory so the first one that we came up with was uh you do a different colour scheme for
[13883.58 → 13888.06] every single month of the year when are you going to store them that's beside the point because if you
[13888.06 → 13894.86] could store 25 cars you could buy 25 taipans here in Vancouver yeah no you just park them on the street
[13894.86 → 13901.98] and then get another one no you guys just got checkmated so hard would you rather have uh one parking
[13901.98 → 13907.34] space well you don't have to buy all of them at the same time oh yeah that's reasonable you can
[13907.34 → 13912.06] know how do you figure it out this one's out of gas you just leave it at the side of the road
[13912.06 → 13916.70] just put wraps on your Taiwan with your sponsorship from brand so you don't pay for them
[13916.70 → 13923.58] anyway boom mic drop this is why he runs the business and get all your stuff stolen because your
[13923.58 → 13929.82] your trunk stays open all the time uh that's user error yeah I don't know I don't know if the key's as
[13929.82 → 13935.18] wacky as you're saying it's not that wacky oh I don't have them Ivan took them oh right I wonder if
[13935.18 → 13945.34] she's breaking my car right now just get it just get 25 auras would fill our parking w tip uh I think
[13945.34 → 13951.82] one extra Acura would fill our parking we're on the're on the edge right now yeah, yeah okay uh Sony
[13951.82 → 13957.58] tech here Blu-rays have been console locked with daughter boards for every single place in by law
[13957.58 → 13963.66] and the PS5 wasn't going to be the one to not adhere to that rule in this case it's not up to Sony
[13963.66 → 13971.34] it's kind of uh bringing back to our earlier topic so but just because it's locked does that mean
[13971.34 → 13979.90] that well hold on a second no I thought you could on a ps1 oh Blu-rays Blu-rays okay so on a PS3
[13981.18 → 13989.10] can you replace Blu-ray drive so someone says if your wife curbs your car you pull out another one of your 25
[13989.10 → 13999.02] 25 wives or your 25 cars just leave it sweetie we've got more at home don't worry I'll
[13999.02 → 14007.90] grab Acura number four oh this is the blue one the Fleur interior it does require swapping the Blu-ray
[14007.90 → 14011.34] drive board from the old drive onto the replacement but here's what I don't understand why isn't the
[14011.34 → 14017.98] board just in the external Blu-ray drive thing then like couldn't it just be an authenticated validated
[14017.98 → 14022.70] thing, and then it just plugs in via USB I mean the Xbox whatever the crap had an USB Blu-ray drive
[14022.70 → 14033.90] didn't it Xbox 360 USB Blu-ray I thought so you can also how to play Blu-ray disc on Xbox One and 360
[14035.50 → 14041.18] if you haven't got one get an external USB Blu-ray disc drive like am i missing something here no it
[14041.18 → 14052.06] had added okay there you go never mind my bad um yeah okay fair enough i I hate it and I feel like
[14052.06 → 14058.46] there would have to be some kind of better solution but if you say it's necessary
[14058.46 → 14063.18] for reasons that are beyond Sony's control then I retract my derision
[14063.18 → 14072.14] I like how Linus is at an age where complicated names like iPad Pro 12.9 inch sixth generation USB
[14072.14 → 14079.02] 3.2 generation 2x2 and snap jargon 8 generation 3 don't deserve to be memorized in his head what
[14079.02 → 14084.46] other names infuriate you the biggest ones for me are not even necessarily the super long ones
[14084.46 → 14088.86] the ones that make me really mad are the ones that are the same from one generation to the next
[14088.86 → 14097.34] mac pro no, no no that's you that's not that's not helpful how am I supposed to look up how am I
[14097.34 → 14102.46] supposed to look up technical articles and specs and find information on this thing it's ridiculous
[14102.46 → 14110.94] it's like they don't want people to know about their products um like i i I don't I and i you know
[14110.94 → 14120.78] again I don't mind if there's a rhyme or reason to it like the a7n32-SLI deluxe okay it's uh it's an
[14120.78 → 14129.10] a for AMD it's seven for you know k7 it's uh actually I don't think there was an a7 see okay see look
[14129.10 → 14135.82] the system works a7 would have been an AMD platform motherboard for the k7 which means there
[14135.82 → 14143.34] was no SLI because that was an AGP platform it would have been the a8 and 32-SLI deluxe uh so 32 if
[14143.34 → 14154.06] I recall correctly referred to the 2x16 PCIE lanes uh so it would have been an a7n uh 8x something for
[14154.06 → 14160.86] the previous generation because you would have had um just an AGP slot and then deluxe generally refers
[14160.86 → 14166.62] to the slightly higher tier board which has like more USB or eSATA or like SATA ports or
[14166.62 → 14173.02] you know FireWire or whatever the case may be um like as long as there's an as long as there's a rhyme
[14173.02 → 14182.38] or a reason to it, I don't mind but non-adherence to a standard naming scheme upsets me a lot like um
[14183.26 → 14188.14] you know or skipping a random generation you know when they just skipped dozen 4000
[14188.14 → 14194.14] even, even like when NVIDIA would be like this generation is best buy exclusive it felt like
[14194.14 → 14199.26] skipping it yeah well that's just as bad that's because it was like or oh it means that it wasn't
[14199.26 → 14209.02] a generation it wasn't a product lineup yeah yeah hey LDL a few wan meets ago you talked about silicon
[14209.02 → 14213.26] fabs how hard do you think it would be for a developing country like India to set up their
[14213.26 → 14217.18] own silicon fab as good as TSMC and Samsung have impossible
[14220.38 → 14224.94] and I don't even mean that as like a knock against India I just mean if you don't have
[14225.74 → 14232.70] the expertise because it's not about access to the water or like the equipment from ASML
[14233.58 → 14242.06] it's about expertise it's about intellectual property like if you are not TSMC Samsung global foundries or
[14242.06 → 14251.74] intel um you're not building a fab at the tier of those guys and even those guys uh you know even
[14251.74 → 14259.34] the second place fab is significantly different in terms of its approach and capabilities compared
[14259.34 → 14263.90] to the first place fab you know even if you're on the same node I mean we've seen this time and time
[14263.90 → 14269.66] again with Samsung being on the same node as TSMC but their power characteristics suck or whatever the
[14269.66 → 14277.90] case may be um it's its as much black magic as it is science at that point and I just don't think it's
[14277.90 → 14285.42] um I just don't think it's realistic I mean china's trying, and they are achieving some pretty amazing stuff
[14285.42 → 14289.58] over there but no they're not on the same level as TSMC and Samsung at least not yet
[14293.82 → 14299.74] yeah this is a good point even TSMC uh space racer brings this up in float plane chat even TSMC is
[14299.74 → 14304.06] having trouble building a fab like TSMC they're trying to build one in the US, and they can't find
[14304.06 → 14310.62] a workforce for it sorry go ahead a burn sorry another interruption Bernie said India is launching
[14310.62 → 14314.78] rockets so it seems it's easier to put something in Spain oh my goodness it seems it's easier to put
[14314.78 → 14320.30] something in space than make a chip well yeah they've been putting rockets in space since the 60s exactly
[14320.30 → 14327.66] they've made it more like back when computers were woven together by hand like burning fuel and like
[14328.70 → 14336.22] rocketing something into space very complicated, but it's more of like a mechanical engineering problem and
[14336.22 → 14344.70] less of like a NATO manufacturing problem yeah yeah all right next up Linus have been meaning
[14344.70 → 14350.06] to ask you since you have your computer on a server rack instead of in your room how do you turn your
[14350.06 → 14358.78] pc on remotely I get up off my lazy gamer and uh go turn it on it sucks i I've been meaning to I've been
[14358.78 → 14363.58] meaning to implement something that is an upcoming video there are a lot of different options there's little
[14363.58 → 14371.10] key fobs that you can um attach to like a relay board to your power switch there's uh pi KVM there's uh
[14371.10 → 14377.42] magic packets as unreliable as I've found that over the years there 's's actually you can just run
[14377.42 → 14385.42] a wire you can actually run an incredibly long wire and just put your power button wherever it turns out
[14385.42 → 14390.94] we've tested it i just uh I think Jake tried like a hundred-foot spool or something like that and it
[14390.94 → 14394.54] totally worked you just bridge the contact, and it turns on the motherboard so I just haven't gotten around
[14394.54 → 14401.90] to it last one the curated hey LLD after all these years of gaming what do you guys think is the
[14401.90 → 14409.26] the greatest game of all time and why okay is this is a very loaded the most or is this what we think
[14409.26 → 14414.06] is the greatest game but is it the greatest for me or is it the greatest for everyone
[14415.18 → 14421.58] what do you think i think it's what do you think is the greatest game of all time for me
[14421.58 → 14427.26] it's what do you think is the greatest game of all time but is this my favourite game no it's the
[14427.26 → 14431.90] game that I think is the greatest game the greatest game the greatest game of all time are you being
[14431.90 → 14436.94] are you being intentionally obtuse no I think it's not very complicated Luke I have something that i
[14436.94 → 14441.90] think is the greatest okay then let's hear it but I don't recommend that anyone please Stalin you communist
[14441.90 → 14446.70] wow, wow
[14447.34 → 14455.58] he's working our bell look at him, he got the dig oh my goodness come on um Skyrim no
[14457.18 → 14459.74] all right well we're we're checking them off the list
[14464.78 → 14471.10] I don't know I don't know what uh I'll have to look that up on steam yeah it's highly rated yeah 98
[14471.10 → 14477.50] metacritic um I mean my personal one is borrowing but is that the greatest game
[14478.54 → 14483.98] it's my favourite one but I don't know if it's the greatest game I think it'd be easier to define
[14483.98 → 14488.54] what metric the greatest game would be measured as
[14494.94 → 14499.82] borrowing inspired me the most it made me care about game development it made me care about
[14500.78 → 14510.86] what went into uh what is it called Foley even like it yeah it made me care about a lot of things
[14510.86 → 14516.38] more than I had ever even considered in the past like before borrowing thank you for mentioning Foley
[14517.02 → 14524.94] yeah um you'd never guess it because man does that game has some I was not expecting to say borrowing and
[14524.94 → 14530.30] yeah the Foley was inspiring uh that's uh that's messed up um but like do you know how do you know
[14530.30 → 14534.22] yeah I understand yeah, but this is what I'm saying like I don't know if it's the greatest game it just
[14534.22 → 14540.46] hit me really hard um but here's a random little tidbit do you know the sound of warthogs hitting
[14540.46 → 14548.38] things do you know what that was they were throwing boxes on the ground oh my the halo don't those guys are on
[14548.38 → 14554.14] another level whoever I don't I should really figure out and worship them more but those
[14554.14 → 14558.78] guys are amazing I got really I got really into I was like thinking I might want to do that and then
[14558.78 → 14564.22] I realized like four people have that job and I was like never mind uh yeah no it's its an incredibly
[14564.22 → 14569.42] weird and creative field and nothing that you hear in games is what you think it is to be clear when i
[14569.42 → 14573.34] say that I've been like oh maybe I should do that to probably pretty much everything in the world
[14573.34 → 14578.14] the world uh so that's not a unique thing uh but yeah so you're going with borrowing
[14580.30 → 14583.74] I feel like it's a cop-out because it's just my favourite game um
[14587.02 → 14594.30] but probably I feel like you need to define the greatness aspect here oh yeah this is obviously
[14594.30 → 14599.74] an impossible question to answer I just enjoyed watching you squirm um i I would be really hard for
[14599.74 → 14605.10] me to come up with one because i you know when I think greatness uh you know I think influence
[14605.10 → 14610.14] right so obviously you have to start talking about games like pong or Tetris or yeah half-life or you
[14610.14 → 14614.38] know whatever else, but those aren't games that I enjoyed they were not part of my childhood they were
[14614.38 → 14619.26] not formative for me, you know for me if I was trying to think greatest you know something like a final
[14619.26 → 14626.22] fantasy 6 I think it has a great story great music like if we talk about a complete game if I tried to
[14626.22 → 14631.50] put like I'm really enjoying if it's perfect if I try to put myself back and when that game was
[14631.50 → 14638.86] released holy hell dude yeah it was great oh yeah um and that's another thing too like do we
[14638.86 → 14644.62] consider it being a product of its time like i I would make the argument that Super Mario world is
[14644.62 → 14652.70] basically a perfect game tell me something to improve about it didn't that game more or less single-handedly
[14652.70 → 14661.18] save at home gaming you could make that argument um although or consoles at least the ness had
[14661.18 → 14666.86] already been very successful was it okay yeah the nest was already very successful but Super Mario world
[14666.86 → 14677.74] was uh an an an a once in a generation of games um game like it was incredible the music the artwork the
[14677.74 → 14687.34] gameplay it was so good um you know i I personally have a really um soft spot for far cry for
[14687.34 → 14693.10] for the first one uh the what was really innovative at the time played them surprisingly
[14693.10 → 14702.22] but they're really going you mean the first one uh I count one and two was crap as early
[14702.22 → 14706.70] far cries I wasn't saying it was good oh I'm just saying not many people played either of those oh
[14706.70 → 14712.78] yeah no um, but they're fascinating both of them to look back at a from a tech perspective
[14713.66 → 14717.50] far cry one really came out of absolutely nowhere
[14719.74 → 14726.22] at a time when everyone was waiting for um what was the stupid doom game at the time I forget doom
[14726.22 → 14731.82] doom ultimate I've I don't remember what I think it ended up being a bit of an uh
[14731.82 → 14739.82] starter yeah doom games listed uh I'm not using Amiga, but they're super cool doom was fine it was just
[14739.82 → 14748.22] flashlight jokes you know uh main series here we go uh doom 2 doom 64 doom 3 that was the one uh yeah so
[14748.22 → 14754.86] everyone was waiting with bated breath for doom 3 half-life 2 and then far cry beat them to market by like
[14754.86 → 14763.90] six months or something like that and was just out of nowhere i in my opinion the best of the three
[14763.90 → 14769.90] and I played through all three of them well that's a dangerous thing to say I'm gonna I'm going to come in
[14769.90 → 14775.82] here doom 3 was trash he said something not amazing about half-life whoa you're going to upset the internet
[14776.94 → 14784.46] oh no actually I've heard dissenting opinions about half-life so it was fun you could approach it any way you
[14784.46 → 14794.86] wanted there were boats and vehicles, and it was beautiful you were in this lush beautiful environment uh you
[14796.46 → 14806.54] you were this colourful character you're like basically like uh like a an a swashbuckler smuggler like
[14806.54 → 14819.18] chad um like you just it just had so much personality um far cry one is awesome and yeah there you
[14819.18 → 14825.18] heard me say it, and it was not open world yet right like we hadn't we hadn't hit open world gaming
[14825.18 → 14832.46] yet but the idea that you just kind of had a marker on your map, and you go and get there however you want
[14832.46 → 14838.86] in the on these giant maps the maps were enormous no loading screens that was crazy at the time that
[14838.86 → 14847.10] was awesome yeah uh the open world nature of Far Cry 3 was actually perfect and then Ubisoft
[14847.10 → 14853.18] decided to spend the next uh what would that have even been decade and a half uh making the
[14853.18 → 14860.30] exact same game with a different skin on it and now people hate it which sucks because if you go back and
[14860.30 → 14867.82] play Far Cry 3 I guarantee you it's trash but I think it's trash because it's been played out so
[14867.82 → 14874.30] hard right yep um I see people talking about max pain I have not played max pain I need to I've only
[14874.30 → 14882.78] played a demo, and it was very fun yeah i i really need to do it yeah um yeah so I'm I get yeah
[14882.78 → 14887.10] but then you know i I've already said before like if I'm being honest with myself taking off the rose
[14887.10 → 14893.26] coloured lenses I think breath of the wild is the best game I've ever played like it's nothing has
[14893.26 → 14899.74] made me like that thing you're talking about before that just spontaneous um exploration yeah nothing
[14899.74 → 14906.14] has made me feel like that the way and been and been as rewarding as breath of the wild, so there's
[14906.14 → 14911.50] games where you'll, you'll want you'll want to explore, but it turns out this is actually a really
[14911.50 → 14916.54] small town there's only like eight people to talk to and most of them don't like to give you a quest or
[14916.54 → 14926.30] or fulfill you in any way you'd hate Starfield oh yeah my thoughts have continuously evolved and
[14926.30 → 14932.30] gotten more negative about that game as time has gone on i my overall if I had to try to condense my
[14932.30 → 14941.82] entire review into one little thing it would be sometimes creativity needs bounce
[14942.62 → 14947.26] yeah yeah that's that's an interesting take and I haven't even touched on anything multiplayer
[14948.30 → 14955.26] like I think there's probably a lot of people who would say yeah counterstrike is the greatest game of
[14955.26 → 14962.54] all time incredible staying it's its it's its closer to chess than it is to like you're like
[14962.54 → 14967.90] something like a far cry where it's like open-ended or whatever it's like it's less about there's
[14967.90 → 14973.50] economy the game being changing, and it's more about the game being a constant and the players changing and
[14973.50 → 14980.38] I thought that in itself is the mark of a great game such a wildly difficult thing to do is that it's
[14980.38 → 14988.30] exactly is easy to learn impossible to master right like it's um and so yeah you could
[14988.30 → 14992.54] make I think you could make if we want to go down these strains I think eve should be mentioned I was
[14992.54 → 14999.90] about to say wow yeah i think that to not mention a MMO in a list of greatest games is a
[14999.90 → 15007.58] huge eve and wow I think almost each individually deserves some type of accolade in this pile and because
[15007.58 → 15018.78] it was I think you could make the argument I will make the argument that MMOs made gaming more
[15018.78 → 15026.54] accessible at a time when people were focused on gameplay styles that were only really accessible to
[15027.50 → 15036.94] um other social a more male audience um a more male you know internet citizen audience like i
[15036.94 → 15047.10] didn't know any gamer girls until wow yeah it anyone it seemed like could enjoy wow, and you know was part
[15047.10 → 15050.62] of it that it was engineered to be digital crack cocaine sure
[15053.18 → 15057.66] was it created by the government, and you know spread to subdue the populace maybe
[15060.14 → 15066.86] but I feel like there's that's great that's a that's that's a great thing they achieved
[15066.86 → 15071.98] to I mean what were their concurrent subscribers at their peak like over 50 million or something
[15071.98 → 15077.58] like that like it was a ton like for something to have that kind of influence there's a dedicated
[15077.58 → 15082.38] South Park episode about it like and that was at south parks peak in terms of cultural sway
[15085.18 → 15093.02] 12 million, but you got to understand how many fewer people were even on the internet at all it was only
[15093.02 → 15099.34] 12 million peak I think so that can't be right I mean it could definitely be wrong that's just what
[15099.34 → 15105.50] I guess 12 million which I believe was the peak wow peaked at 12 million subscribers but okay hold on
[15105.50 → 15112.94] remember so few people had computers that could even run it yeah that's I knew people back then that didn't
[15112.94 → 15121.58] have the internet at home, or they were still on like genuine put the phone on the thing dial up yeah oh yeah
[15121.58 → 15128.46] that's true like i my computer when wow first came out um when I played back in 2004 if I wanted
[15128.46 → 15134.30] to raid I had to point my camera at the wall because the game was unplayable if I didn't do that i
[15134.30 → 15138.14] couldn't look at the fight that was happening and I had to just like hope and I would get like three
[15138.14 → 15140.22] or four fps I'm not even kidding wow
[15142.38 → 15149.50] so I like it was not very accessible in regard to technological requirements I see a lot of people
[15149.50 → 15153.98] talking about just like genre defining you know games like something like a street fighter what
[15153.98 → 15160.54] has had the staying power of street fighter oh yeah no street fighters older than counterstrike by a
[15160.54 → 15169.34] long shot you're you're right but I wonder what the gap is its big fighter wait was that arcade before
[15169.34 → 15176.46] console oh yeah baby oof okay yeah 1987 for street fighter I forgot it would have been arcade first and
[15176.46 → 15180.94] like you could say oh yeah Tetris you know maintains relevance today but i I would argue
[15180.94 → 15188.62] street fighter and its inspirational clones are like it's the clones that it inspired have had a longer
[15188.62 → 15194.06] period of relevance than almost anything else like people still freaking play street fighter
[15194.94 → 15198.62] and people were freaking playing street fighter back in the late 1980s
[15200.78 → 15206.22] all right i have to bring one up 2000 for yeah hit me RuneScape I mean you talked about how
[15206.22 → 15212.94] wow was taking cues from RuneScape's hard mode and iron mode like that is such a distilled experience
[15212.94 → 15219.82] that's happening now yeah we talk about number go up and like do thing number go up get to 99 right
[15219.82 → 15225.98] RuneScape is such a distilled experience for that type of gameplay loop which everything else is built
[15225.98 → 15232.14] on in my opinion the fact that people still play it is so perfectly addictive the original levels of
[15232.14 → 15237.58] number go up that people still play it I mean I think that there's there are arguments to be made for
[15237.58 → 15243.74] warcraft 2 star craft warcraft 3 any one of them modding warcraft 3 modding well don't forget data
[15243.74 → 15250.14] star craft modding was a big thing in star craft as well so warcraft 2 you had custom maps he was
[15250.14 → 15255.58] crazy the way that the map editor evolved that's the reason I brought up all three of them because in
[15255.58 → 15261.58] warcraft 2 you could create custom scenarios but in star craft you could do a bunch of scripting
[15262.38 → 15267.58] because the campaigns had a bunch of scripting, and they basically made as far as I can tell made
[15267.58 → 15275.98] the map editor functional like their own tools but warcraft 3 a made it more accessible and b I think
[15275.98 → 15282.46] the general internet dwelling population was getting more code savvy yeah, and it was just this perfect
[15282.46 → 15289.74] storm moment of incredible creativity meets incredible tools and data was born yeah right
[15289.74 → 15296.22] and lots of other stuff lots of other stuff I mean tower defence yeah kind of existed but is an entire
[15296.22 → 15305.42] genre of gaming now yeah and really from as far as I can tell had its um inflection point with
[15305.42 → 15309.98] warcraft 3 like I know there were tower defence mods for star craft and I know there was stuff before that
[15309.98 → 15317.18] but warcraft 3 man tower defence was huge that was the hockey stick moment for custom games um despite
[15317.18 → 15322.14] them existing significantly beforehand warcraft 3 was crazy i I remember there was a pretty significant
[15322.14 → 15326.30] period of time when all my friends would just play warcraft 3 custom games and nothing else and there
[15326.30 → 15331.34] was a big range that was a whole summer for me, we'd play dot awe'd play winter mall wars I used to
[15331.34 → 15338.22] love winter mall wars yeah winter mall was a very good TD winter mall wars was a versus TD we had to fight
[15338.22 → 15344.14] each other so cool so much fun and all these crazy strategies of how you balance your economy it's
[15344.14 → 15348.94] got built-in multiplayer too right yeah like it just comes with multiplayer yeah did we ever play that
[15348.94 → 15356.06] risk map for supreme commander I remember talking about it, I don't know if we oh it's its really fun
[15356.06 → 15363.82] I feel like we might have but I don't know anyway that is the last of my curated oh I'm I'm glad that
[15363.82 → 15368.94] one went for so long yeah lots of potentials can you start curating them or just reading them out
[15368.94 → 15375.18] pick one why do I not have the interface open okay well I don't have the dashboard so you guys feel free
[15375.18 → 15383.10] to um okay do stuff uh with augmented reality being able to be used on even lower tier work devices like
[15383.10 → 15390.78] the Samsung cover pro what are some ways you foresee AR being used in business for example Walmart uses
[15390.78 → 15393.42] Vizio for keeping logs of stock
[15396.46 → 15405.82] oh training is probably the biggest one for me like i uh or just um you know remotely instructing
[15405.82 → 15413.42] someone like imagine for a second if uh someone the size of Walmart right with all your dozens or
[15413.42 → 15418.94] hundreds of stores or whatever it is instead of having like a trained technician in every region for
[15418.94 → 15423.10] how to fix your POS terminals if you could just have half a dozen of them sitting at a central
[15423.10 → 15429.10] location that can instruct any idiot on how to fix something i i I could see that being absolutely huge
[15429.74 → 15437.90] um i i I think we are just beginning to imagine all the ways that AR is going to is going to change
[15437.90 → 15446.62] our lives i uh that could be a whole LAN show but yeah everything it's its it's already being used in a
[15446.62 → 15458.22] big way, and it's just the beginning hi LLD I work in the bioinformatics would you consider some sort of
[15458.22 → 15463.82] collaboration to show people how HPC clusters or servers are actually used and what's actually meant
[15463.82 → 15469.98] by scientific applications in biology I'd love to, but the challenge with that is a lot of the time the
[15469.98 → 15475.26] work that's being done is not very visual, and it doesn't translate well to a visual medium like video so
[15475.26 → 15480.86] there have been situations where we've wanted to collaborate with industries um or like
[15480.86 → 15487.26] educational institutions on you know just talking about HPC or um you know data visualization or not
[15487.26 → 15495.18] data or like um you know high-end visualization um applications like there was this one where they
[15495.18 → 15503.98] they try to extract the oil and gas from sunken ships from like World War ii to keep it from leaking out
[15503.98 → 15510.06] into the ocean, and also it's like worth money I guess and stuff um, and we wanted to do something
[15510.06 → 15514.38] with them, and it just like it didn't really work because the only way for us to do it would be to
[15514.38 → 15521.02] like go out on a ship into the Atlantic Ocean otherwise we're just talking about and like
[15521.02 → 15525.42] it's so cool by the way they would do this like visualization like under the ocean thing
[15525.42 → 15533.90] I will volunteer my time um it's too much time okay yeah it was it's like it was like over a week
[15533.90 → 15538.30] just to get to the site because yeah and like there's no guarantee things will go well because
[15538.30 → 15544.70] it's like ocean exploration in the ocean yeah yeah so like I forbid it yeah uh fair enough yeah
[15547.98 → 15554.78] hello LLD buying my first gift card to save up for shipping Linus what happened to your DIY
[15554.78 → 15560.62] water cooling bed always curious if you still use or stayed with the eight sleep mattress is it any
[15560.62 → 15565.74] good I still use the eight sleep no the DIY water cooling bed was hilarious, but it was not it was
[15565.74 → 15575.82] not a real any more you just want to start reading them off i just uh sorry let's just go for it
[15576.46 → 15581.74] just do it you coward here I'm trying to create things I just created one oh my god we have a
[15581.74 → 15588.22] system why didn't you use the controlled atmospheric chamber to test the sub ambient pc wouldn't humidity
[15588.22 → 15592.70] control be helpful to ensure as little moisture buildup as possible our humidity control wasn't
[15592.70 → 15598.94] working yet at that point in fact while it was working for a while it is now broken again because
[15598.94 → 15604.54] the housing on the pump for the water loop failed right as we were filming a video this week on
[15604.54 → 15610.54] the indestructible laptop that Keith from the uh the tech shop sold me so we'll get back to you on that
[15611.26 → 15619.10] basically howdy LLD I have a one and a half year old son and wanted to see what baby steps I can take
[15619.10 → 15625.82] to get them to slowly start gaming any specific games or activities that would be helpful gaming is
[15625.82 → 15631.58] highly addictive and a high stimulation activity you won't need to do anything to get them gaming
[15631.58 → 15636.62] they will game uh whether you like it or not they'll do anything that you do like it or not
[15636.62 → 15644.38] um so you know keep that in mind with all your bad habits um and try to get them to do other things
[15644.38 → 15650.38] um one of the things that I did was I told my kids that they weren't allowed to play I play RPG games
[15651.10 → 15657.18] and whenever they would see me playing one I think bravely default was the one that i I did this with
[15657.18 → 15661.66] uh for my first kid, and he was like I want to play that can I play that game I go no you won't
[15661.66 → 15667.98] enjoy it until you can read so learn to read, and then you can play motivate kids you gotta
[15667.98 → 15674.38] incentivize them gaming should be a carrot not an end goal yep I don't even have kids and I agree
[15674.38 → 15681.50] you thoroughly hey LLD curious as to why you think computer repair shops are a bad idea as somebody
[15681.50 → 15688.94] who has run their own for the past decade somewhat successfully uh gen x and zed are quite Luddite um
[15690.14 → 15695.98] it's not that I think they're a bad idea it's that I think they're an extremely challenging business
[15695.98 → 15704.70] which I'm sure you I'm sure you wouldn't disagree with um and the repair aspect is by far the most
[15704.70 → 15709.02] lucrative the one that I'm constantly discouraging people from is the one where they think they're
[15709.02 → 15715.34] just going to become a system integrator that is a brutal business where it's extremely difficult to
[15715.34 → 15720.86] come up with any kind of unique value proposition and if you don't have a unique value proposition
[15720.86 → 15725.82] why should I buy from you instead of one of the hundred other system integrators that can buy
[15725.82 → 15731.26] parts at new egg and assemble them for me um that's that's where i I really think people are going to
[15731.26 → 15737.26] run into challenges um honestly if I wanted to get into the computer shop business though right now
[15737.26 → 15743.26] I don't even know that I would start one I think that what I would rather do is like inherit one or
[15743.26 → 15748.06] like you try to buy one from the owner or something like that I think that would be a better
[15748.06 → 15752.22] bet so you have that established clientele that it's least that is at least used to you being there
[15752.22 → 15758.38] um because I think it'd be really hard to break out as a brand-new computer repair shop without any
[15758.38 → 15760.62] kind of established trust
[15764.06 → 15770.62] hi LLD business question could you shed light on how sourcing for Ltd labs differs from sourcing for
[15770.62 → 15778.14] creator warehouse from a supply chain and operations perspective I have no idea that's the goal
[15778.14 → 15788.62] that's and last one hi Linus at Ltd I got the 10 million subscriber case and I want to see if
[15788.62 → 15795.34] there's any possibility I could buy the play button c pc that came with it also plan to build a top of the
[15795.34 → 15807.74] line pc inside it oh I'm so sorry but I was willing to bid adieu to the uh like the the the case for it
[15808.38 → 15818.06] but as a YouTuber my 10 million subscriber diamond play buttons is one of my most prized possessions um
[15818.06 → 15824.14] um and I just don't see any conceivable way that I could part with it
[15826.54 → 15831.10], but thank you for that donation that um helped some sick kids
[15833.18 → 15836.78] yeah, and thanks for watching the wan show we'll see you again next week same bad time
[15836.78 → 15841.02] same bad channel Luke's going down in super checks probably bye
[15841.02 → 15853.10] bye
[15857.02 → 15857.42] all right
[15857.42 → 15860.54] okay super checks let's go wherever you need to be is not as important as you can
[15864.38 → 15865.90] I'll lock up don't you worry
[15869.58 → 15873.02] that's fine we can help lock up because we have to we have to go get a thing for me to stand on
[15873.02 → 15877.66] anyway I'm not tall enough to play with Luke okay well because I need the game to be
