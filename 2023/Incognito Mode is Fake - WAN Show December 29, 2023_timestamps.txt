Original message: In the midd(l)e of my course's finals right now, will send over the stamps in three hours or so - see you by then!

Went to sleep: “no timestamps because of finals and will get to in 3 hrs” ok no problem. 
Wake up: omg why no time stamps?! [looks at video length] oh dear god. I guess i gotta wait another hour. Good luck timestamp guy/nolkie.

Edit: someone else posted some time stamps. 

Video comments: I’ve been a loyal FF user since like late 2004 (it was version .9 had to look up the date since my memory sucks and it was in college). My time using the browser has been great. I only use chrome if a site is weird and not functional. I have yet to experience this, but some sites have better features on chrome so i may use them there. But it’s like google meet and a couple of other sites for video calls (often with doctors and it’s probably based on google meet i’m sure).

As far as the actor situation: i support the actors and writers 100%. Maybe warner would have less issues if they decided to make content people actually watch and didn’t pay their CEO half a BILLION dollars in a contract. Paramount has been meh for a long time now, so not surprised they are losing money. The best thing they released recently is The Curse and it’s pretty good. Well unless you are a Star Trek fan they got a monopoly on that. And they have the IP of MTV, Comedy Central, and stuff which is cool i guess? But I don’t think gen Z know what that stuff is. Modern generations aren’t spending their time watching this bs. They are playing games, watching TikTok’s, youtube, and watching twitch. That’s where they get their entertainment. Let these big companies die because they refused to adapt to modern markets. Netflix is killing it because they offer a. Wide variety of exclusive content and even offer games and other things to keep people subscribed. The other services have no idea how to cost cut on movies and see everything as super cinematic and artful to every detail. You think a youtuber hires as many people as a hollywood movie? Nope, but they still make some fantastic content (digital circus, mr beast, LTT, hazbin hotel) and on a small fraction of the budgets a hollywood movie gets. Granted it’s not as full of special fx and the latest technology, but we need to start asking ourselves, does it need to be? Are we really getting entertainment value from these added costs? Not every movie needs to be 100 million dollars to do well, look at the horror genre. And even so a lot of that money goes to people who don’t need another penny in their life to survive. Big studios stopped taking risks decades ago and it’s killing them.

After the show ended there was a message from Timestamp Guy, that he will be at it in 3 hours or so due to finals, but now even that comment is gone. Is YouTube blocking him again or something?

[2023-12-30T14:29:48Z] Video: Incognito Mode is Fake - WAN Show December 29, 2023 
Yeah no, I'm not giving you 4 hours without timestamps.
