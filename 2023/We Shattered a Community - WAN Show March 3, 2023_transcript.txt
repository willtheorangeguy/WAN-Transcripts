[0.00 --> 8.00]  Happy Friday everyone and welcome to the WAN show. I learned something this week, maybe not this week, but recently.
[8.00 --> 14.00]  That short bit at the beginning where I'm looking at the camera, that's called a millennial pause.
[14.00 --> 15.00]  Why?
[15.00 --> 20.00]  It's really stupid. We'll talk about it later. We've got a lot of great stuff to talk to you guys about this week.
[20.00 --> 29.00]  The wiggle that killed Tarkov, the video we talked about last week and kind of leaked, has blown up and in the process,
[29.00 --> 37.00]  shattered the Tarkov community. I would say that it has broken it in half, but actually it's in about a million pieces.
[37.00 --> 39.00]  So we're going to talk about that. What else we got this week?
[39.00 --> 44.00]  The Olympics of eSports featuring games that you've never heard of.
[44.00 --> 46.00]  You're picking that as a main topic?
[46.00 --> 51.00]  Yeah, yeah. Yep. I actually love this topic and I'm very excited for it.
[51.00 --> 52.00]  Oh my gosh.
[52.00 --> 58.00]  This is probably my favorite topic of the whole show. And you only picked one topic, so I don't think you get to talk this week.
[58.00 --> 59.00]  I had the millennial pause.
[59.00 --> 60.00]  That's a topic?
[60.00 --> 66.00]  I gotta reverse that and throw it right back at you.
[66.00 --> 69.00]  What else? I don't know.
[69.00 --> 77.00]  You can buy a car that can repossess itself. I don't know. Whatever, dude.
[77.00 --> 78.00]  What? So they just-
[78.00 --> 81.00]  Don't listen to anything! They watch four hours!
[81.00 --> 82.00]  Wandshow Dystopia Edition!
[82.00 --> 84.00]  I don't care at this point. Yeah, whatever.
[84.00 --> 85.00]  Yeah, whatever.
[85.00 --> 86.00]  Whatever.
[86.00 --> 87.00]  It is.
[87.00 --> 100.00]  The show is brought to you today by Thorim, The Ridge, and Zoho One.
[100.00 --> 101.00]  Alright.
[101.00 --> 102.00]  Alright.
[102.00 --> 103.00]  Let's do the Tarkov topic.
[103.00 --> 104.00]  The wiggle.
[104.00 --> 105.00]  Last week, yes.
[105.00 --> 113.00]  Last week, Luke accidentally on purpose leaked the upcoming video from Goat.
[113.00 --> 114.00]  You did it on purpose!
[114.00 --> 115.00]  You did it!
[115.00 --> 118.00]  Well, I didn't even know! How can I leak what I don't know?
[118.00 --> 147.00]  Luke accidentally on purpose leaked the concept of a video from creator Goat, Big Tarkov creator, who cheated in the game in order to expose cheating.
[147.00 --> 159.00]  The summary is that Goat basically went, I feel like a lot of people are cheating, but because there's no playback, there's no kill cam, nothing like that, no match replay, I have no way of proving this.
[159.00 --> 167.00]  So, the way to do it could be to cheat myself and see if I can identify other cheaters that way.
[167.00 --> 177.00]  When he got immersed into the cheater community, he found that there was an old way of identifying friendlies that's not really in use in the game anymore,
[177.00 --> 190.00]  by regular players, but is still in use by cheaters, where one goes like that, and the other goes like that to indicate, hey, bruh, we're on the same side.
[190.00 --> 207.00]  Now, the way that it's, the thing that made it so obvious that it was always cheaters using this wiggle was that people would be doing it from clear across the map with trees and buildings and mountains in between them,
[207.00 --> 213.00]  and would be looking like right at each other, because some of the cheats would actually tell you if someone had their crosshair on you, is that right?
[213.00 --> 224.00]  Yeah, so there's a bunch of different ones. The one that he used in the video was like one of the easiest ones that you can get, and it's been undetected for like years.
[224.00 --> 232.00]  So that's the reason why he went that route. So it wasn't super sophisticated, but you could see exactly where people were aiming, and you could see people through walls,
[232.00 --> 239.00]  you could see what they had in their inventory, you could see everything. He also figured out after the video that people that have the more advanced cheats,
[239.00 --> 249.00]  it's all on a separate monitor. So it's a separate computer, so it's even less detectable. So they don't see the wireframe through the wall.
[249.00 --> 257.00]  So it's not really a wall hack in that way. But they have the radar on a side monitor. So they do a different form of wiggle, which he wasn't even doing in the video.
[257.00 --> 264.00]  So there's probably a higher percentage of hackers, which is where, because they can see where people are aiming, it like draws a line out from everyone's character.
[264.00 --> 275.00]  They sweep, so they look left and right. So they like sweep their aimer line over you. So that's like, they do kind of like a map wiggle instead of a leaning wiggle.
[275.00 --> 292.00]  So there's probably even more than he thought. The problem with all of this is that the game is so realism focused, and cheating changes the dynamic so much that essentially this video has,
[292.00 --> 298.00]  Goat has single-handedly destroyed the community for this game.
[298.00 --> 305.00]  I mean, I haven't been paying close attention to it. I've seen a little bit of the fallout, but can you kind of catch me up here on what's been going on?
[305.00 --> 309.00]  Yeah. So first off, I hadn't seen the video before it got released.
[309.00 --> 316.00]  Right. And he did an interview with me, which I thought he might use maybe 30 seconds to two minutes of. He used the whole thing.
[316.00 --> 320.00]  Oh, wow. Okay. So like the second half of the video is just him and I talking.
[320.00 --> 323.00]  So really you even bringing this up in the first place was pure self promotion.
[323.00 --> 325.00]  Apparently. Yeah.
[325.00 --> 326.00]  Typical.
[326.00 --> 332.00]  I think that was probably the wrong move. And he has said a bunch of times, like if he knew it was going to blow up this much,
[332.00 --> 335.00]  he would have spent more time working on the video, et cetera.
[335.00 --> 338.00]  But yeah, it's got like one and a half million views.
[338.00 --> 341.00]  Yeah, it's massive for a Tarkov video. That's like unheard of.
[342.00 --> 347.00]  But that does mean that he's going to have some follow ups to try to keep pushing on this topic.
[347.00 --> 355.00]  And he's like had a bunch of people reach out, including people from the Valorant anti cheat Vanguard that have talked to him,
[355.00 --> 362.00]  because an interesting thing that we brought up on the last show is that you can't have Valorant installed and cheat in Tarkov
[362.00 --> 367.00]  because Valorant's Vanguard anti cheat will detect it and stop you, which is hilarious.
[367.00 --> 371.00]  So people from there have reached out and he's going to have some follow up videos, which should be really good.
[371.00 --> 379.00]  But the immediate aftermath of us like leaking it and then him launching that video was just leaking us.
[379.00 --> 385.00]  Yeah, it was actually you was absolute insanity.
[385.00 --> 389.00]  First off, people were spam posting it on the escape from Tarkov Reddit.
[390.00 --> 395.00]  But that Reddit doesn't allow like cheater POV videos, which kind of makes sense.
[396.00 --> 400.00]  So they were mass deleting all the posts.
[400.00 --> 402.00]  But people were like, this is very topical.
[402.00 --> 405.00]  This isn't like someone advertising cheats. This post should be allowed.
[405.00 --> 407.00]  So there was this gigantic war.
[407.00 --> 411.00]  There's a way on Reddit. I think it's not technically on Reddit.
[411.00 --> 415.00]  It's an external website, but you can see what posts have been deleted by moderators.
[415.00 --> 417.00]  Oh, and if you went on there, I didn't know that.
[417.00 --> 420.00]  Actually, I'm not a big Reddit user. I think it's an I didn't know either.
[420.00 --> 422.00]  I think it's an external site. Someone linked it to me.
[422.00 --> 424.00]  Wonderful community, though. Not toxic at all.
[425.00 --> 432.00]  It's just walls and walls and walls and walls and walls of deleted posts because all these people are trying to force it in.
[432.00 --> 436.00]  And the moderators are trying to force it back. And it was just this crazy war.
[437.00 --> 450.00]  Eventually, the way that people found kind of a loophole to make sure the post could go up there was they took the clip from the WAN show of us talking about it because we didn't have any of the footage.
[450.00 --> 454.00]  We were just talking about the video. So we weren't showing cheats. Yeah.
[454.00 --> 456.00]  So I see. So they posted that.
[456.00 --> 459.00]  And then the moderators saw that and realized they couldn't really remove it.
[459.00 --> 462.00]  So they just blocked all comments on the post.
[462.00 --> 464.00]  So they locked the post, but let it sit there.
[464.00 --> 470.00]  So our WAN show like clip was top of that Reddit for like quite a while.
[470.00 --> 474.00]  And then eventually the war just never stopped.
[474.00 --> 475.00]  People kept posting this video.
[475.00 --> 480.00]  So eventually they like unblocked the first one that came in and then pinned it.
[480.00 --> 482.00]  But I think they still locked the comments on it.
[482.00 --> 485.00]  Yeah. And they had to make like an official announcement about and everything.
[485.00 --> 491.00]  I've I have never personally seen a subreddit that on fire ever.
[491.00 --> 494.00]  Really? Have you hung out in the r slash Linus Tech Tips one?
[494.00 --> 498.00]  Yes, actually, even considering stuff that happens in there.
[498.00 --> 501.00]  I've never seen a subreddit that on fire. It was crazy.
[501.00 --> 512.00]  And then immediately after it starts getting spammed on Reddit, people start spamming Tarkov creators that are currently streaming the game, the video, trying to get them to watch it.
[512.00 --> 513.00]  Right.
[513.00 --> 515.00]  So these people had no primer.
[515.00 --> 518.00]  They had no warning of like what it was.
[518.00 --> 521.00]  Oh, just their whole community is like, watch this.
[521.00 --> 523.00]  Watch this thing. Go, go, go, go.
[523.00 --> 524.00]  And then they have to start reacting to it live.
[524.00 --> 533.00]  And that it that was brutal because like a lot of these people, especially if they're Tarkov creators, they know there's a lot of cheating in the game.
[533.00 --> 538.00]  Yeah, but they haven't seen it from a cheater's perspective and they don't know quite necessarily how bad it is.
[538.00 --> 541.00]  They might have a pretty accurate assumption of how bad it is.
[541.00 --> 543.00]  But they've never actually like seen it. Right.
[543.00 --> 546.00]  So some of the reactions were pretty brutal.
[546.00 --> 555.00]  A bunch of creators were like very negative about the video existing at all and very anti goat at the very beginning.
[555.00 --> 556.00]  Yeah.
[556.00 --> 559.00]  And then the community reaction to that was really negative.
[559.00 --> 562.00]  So then the community's like really aggro against all these creators.
[562.00 --> 565.00]  And then some of the creators start kind of flipping back.
[565.00 --> 568.00]  Now, here's something here's something I did see.
[568.00 --> 581.00]  My understanding is that there's some kind of of tier of participation within the Tarkov community where people get perks directly from Battlestate games that are.
[581.00 --> 587.00]  And I mean, you'll have to correct me if my understanding is is not right here because I'm not super into Tarkov.
[587.00 --> 590.00]  I've only played it a handful of times with like him and Joe.
[590.00 --> 602.00]  But my understanding is that on a fairly regular basis, they get like a lot of ammo and equipment like like they get these these packs or these drops that are quite valuable.
[602.00 --> 611.00]  And that while they aren't a bribe could potentially put them in a position where they want to retain their their community liaison.
[611.00 --> 615.00]  There is so there is in order to continue getting perks.
[615.00 --> 623.00]  So there might be an incentive in the community to kind of sweep under the rug anything that paints Battlestate games in a negative light.
[623.00 --> 626.00]  Is that is that a fair understanding of the situation?
[626.00 --> 631.00]  This is only something that I've actually even heard about recently because I've never.
[631.00 --> 634.00]  I just like play Tarkov with Joe.
[634.00 --> 637.00]  Right. So you've never really engaged in the community.
[637.00 --> 640.00]  Yeah, like I never I don't really use Reddit that often.
[640.00 --> 642.00]  I would never really go on the subreddit like I don't really care.
[642.00 --> 644.00]  I just played the game. Right.
[644.00 --> 649.00]  But very recently before this broke, I heard about that system.
[649.00 --> 650.00]  Yeah.
[650.00 --> 658.00]  And I do know that some creators have some like very weird levels of insight into what's going on at BSG.
[658.00 --> 659.00]  Yeah.
[659.00 --> 670.00]  To the point where there was a post somewhat recently where they were talking about how certain creators were like influencing the like dev pipeline directly and like meeting with developers directly, which is like fine.
[670.00 --> 672.00]  Actually, actually quite cool.
[672.00 --> 675.00]  But it needs to be transparent as well.
[675.00 --> 676.00]  Yeah.
[676.00 --> 683.00]  Yeah. And in some ways it is totally like some of them will say like, oh, I'm a I don't know what they're called because again, I have never really cared.
[683.00 --> 684.00]  Yeah.
[684.00 --> 687.00]  But they're like, oh, I'm a whatever Sherpas Sherpas.
[687.00 --> 688.00]  Sherpas.
[688.00 --> 689.00]  OK, so Sherpas is slightly different.
[689.00 --> 690.00]  OK.
[690.00 --> 694.00]  As far as my understanding goes, Sherpas are supposed to be people who like help other people learn.
[694.00 --> 695.00]  Yes.
[695.00 --> 698.00]  Tarkov. So that's where some of the direct items came from.
[698.00 --> 699.00]  Yeah.
[699.00 --> 701.00]  That's what I think I was talking about.
[701.00 --> 704.00]  So I don't know if the Sherpas, maybe they do.
[704.00 --> 705.00]  I don't know a lot about this.
[705.00 --> 706.00]  Emissary and Sherpas.
[706.00 --> 708.00]  Emissary is the other one.
[708.00 --> 710.00]  W22 Brown is saying in float plane chat.
[710.00 --> 713.00]  So Emissary is where they have like direct contact with BSG.
[713.00 --> 714.00]  Got it. OK.
[714.00 --> 715.00]  Sherpas.
[715.00 --> 717.00]  I don't know what level of contact they have with BSG.
[717.00 --> 718.00]  Either way.
[718.00 --> 719.00]  But they help new players.
[719.00 --> 724.00]  What they know is that Battlestate Games is in communication with some members of the community.
[724.00 --> 732.00]  And that it's not always clear who is or isn't getting influence over the development process and who is or isn't getting perks.
[732.00 --> 733.00]  Or to what degree.
[733.00 --> 734.00]  Right.
[734.00 --> 735.00]  And like.
[735.00 --> 745.00]  But there's an incentive certainly for some members of the community to downplay the impact of this of this cheating.
[745.00 --> 746.00]  Well.
[746.00 --> 747.00]  And keep the gravy train rolling.
[747.00 --> 751.00]  Maybe even if they're not in contact with BSG and maybe even if they don't receive these.
[751.00 --> 752.00]  Well sure.
[752.00 --> 753.00]  I mean it's kind of.
[753.00 --> 755.00]  It's kind of like the way that Apple engages with the press.
[755.00 --> 756.00]  Right.
[756.00 --> 757.00]  They don't explicitly say.
[757.00 --> 758.00]  Look.
[758.00 --> 760.00]  You're not allowed to talk about Hackintosh.
[760.00 --> 763.00]  You're not allowed to criticize this and don't talk about this.
[763.00 --> 765.00]  But everybody knows.
[765.00 --> 766.00]  And everybody plays the game.
[766.00 --> 767.00]  You get cut off.
[767.00 --> 768.00]  Or.
[768.00 --> 769.00]  You.
[769.00 --> 770.00]  Well it's.
[770.00 --> 772.00]  It's less that you get cut off and more that you will never get the call in the first place.
[772.00 --> 777.00]  Apple's engagement in many cases has nothing to do with how many views you're likely to get.
[777.00 --> 782.00]  I mean we'll get more views on an iPhone video than 90 percent of the people they seat an iPhone to.
[782.00 --> 783.00]  Yeah.
[783.00 --> 784.00]  It's nothing to do with that.
[784.00 --> 786.00]  But we're not stylish enough.
[786.00 --> 787.00]  Well.
[787.00 --> 794.00]  I in particular am not cool enough to be the kind of press outlet that Apple would want to engage with.
[794.00 --> 798.00]  Even if I was super positive about the products because I have been at times.
[798.00 --> 799.00]  But I'm also a loose cannon.
[799.00 --> 801.00]  They know that they can't rely on me.
[801.00 --> 802.00]  Yeah.
[802.00 --> 804.00]  To be nice about it.
[804.00 --> 806.00]  You might talk about their products while walking in the rain.
[806.00 --> 807.00]  Yeah.
[807.00 --> 808.00]  Yeah.
[808.00 --> 809.00]  I just might.
[809.00 --> 810.00]  I'm not sure.
[810.00 --> 811.00]  So.
[811.00 --> 814.00]  So I could see it being very much that way where.
[814.00 --> 816.00]  There's an unspoken.
[816.00 --> 818.00]  Here's what's okay to talk about.
[818.00 --> 820.00]  Here's what's okay to emphasize.
[820.00 --> 822.00]  And these are all no no's.
[822.00 --> 823.00]  So.
[823.00 --> 826.00]  And like I don't necessarily know that that stuff is happening.
[826.00 --> 829.00]  But it makes sense that it might be with some of them.
[829.00 --> 830.00]  Yeah.
[830.00 --> 833.00]  There's also other stuff where like for some.
[833.00 --> 835.00]  Creators of any kind.
[835.00 --> 836.00]  Realistically.
[836.00 --> 839.00]  If you are tied to like one thing.
[839.00 --> 841.00]  Like if you are a Tarkov creator.
[841.00 --> 842.00]  And that's it.
[842.00 --> 843.00]  Yeah.
[843.00 --> 844.00]  If you are a X creator.
[844.00 --> 845.00]  If you are a Y creator.
[845.00 --> 846.00]  Yeah.
[846.00 --> 847.00]  If you're tied to one thing.
[847.00 --> 848.00]  And that thing is under attack.
[848.00 --> 849.00]  Even with no.
[849.00 --> 850.00]  Even subconsciously.
[850.00 --> 851.00]  Yeah.
[851.00 --> 852.00]  With no direct contact.
[852.00 --> 853.00]  With no direct benefit.
[853.00 --> 854.00]  I mean.
[854.00 --> 855.00]  Look at what happened to.
[855.00 --> 856.00]  That could risk your job.
[856.00 --> 857.00]  Look at what happened to Ninja.
[857.00 --> 858.00]  When Fortnite.
[858.00 --> 859.00]  Yeah.
[859.00 --> 860.00]  Became less culturally relevant.
[860.00 --> 861.00]  For.
[861.00 --> 862.00]  Like it's like one to one.
[862.00 --> 863.00]  And I'm sure.
[863.00 --> 864.00]  They had communication.
[864.00 --> 865.00]  They didn't.
[865.00 --> 866.00]  If there was no.
[866.00 --> 867.00]  If there was a complete.
[867.00 --> 868.00]  Gap.
[868.00 --> 870.00]  Between Ninja and Fortnite.
[870.00 --> 871.00]  Fortnite going down.
[871.00 --> 873.00]  Is going to bother Ninja.
[873.00 --> 874.00]  Yeah.
[874.00 --> 875.00]  Whether he knows or not.
[875.00 --> 876.00]  It doesn't matter.
[876.00 --> 877.00]  The name of the person doesn't matter.
[877.00 --> 879.00]  And the subject doesn't matter.
[879.00 --> 880.00]  If tech becomes less relevant.
[880.00 --> 881.00]  If I'm a tech YouTuber.
[881.00 --> 882.00]  Yep.
[882.00 --> 883.00]  And I have to pivot.
[883.00 --> 884.00]  It's bad for us.
[884.00 --> 885.00]  Yeah.
[885.00 --> 886.00]  And even if it's.
[886.00 --> 887.00]  Even if ultimately we survive.
[887.00 --> 888.00]  And we kind of go.
[888.00 --> 889.00]  Okay.
[889.00 --> 890.00]  We're going all in on.
[890.00 --> 891.00]  Channel super fun.
[891.00 --> 892.00]  Um.
[892.00 --> 893.00]  Yikes.
[893.00 --> 894.00]  It's.
[894.00 --> 895.00]  It's.
[895.00 --> 896.00]  That's still a lot of work.
[896.00 --> 897.00]  That's still a lot of stress.
[897.00 --> 898.00]  That's still something.
[898.00 --> 899.00]  That risk.
[899.00 --> 900.00]  Would be.
[900.00 --> 901.00]  Would be terrifying.
[901.00 --> 902.00]  Compared to.
[902.00 --> 903.00]  Oh.
[903.00 --> 904.00]  I'll just.
[904.00 --> 905.00]  Uh.
[905.00 --> 906.00]  You know.
[906.00 --> 907.00]  Let's.
[907.00 --> 908.00]  Let's do.
[908.00 --> 909.00]  Laser disc.
[909.00 --> 910.00]  Retrospective.
[910.00 --> 911.00]  Okay.
[911.00 --> 912.00]  Yeah.
[912.00 --> 913.00]  Let's go.
[913.00 --> 914.00]  Tech.
[914.00 --> 915.00]  Tech.
[915.00 --> 916.00]  That's why like.
[916.00 --> 917.00]  The.
[917.00 --> 918.00]  The.
[918.00 --> 920.00]  The creators almost getting ambushed with this while they were live.
[920.00 --> 924.00]  With no ability to watch beforehand and collect their thoughts and figure it out.
[924.00 --> 925.00]  Yeah.
[925.00 --> 927.00]  I think is part of the reason why the initial reaction was so strong.
[927.00 --> 928.00]  Because.
[928.00 --> 929.00]  It might be subconscious.
[929.00 --> 930.00]  Right?
[930.00 --> 931.00]  Yeah.
[931.00 --> 932.00]  They're just like this sucks.
[932.00 --> 933.00]  This sucks for a lot of reasons.
[933.00 --> 934.00]  Yeah.
[934.00 --> 935.00]  And I'm angry.
[935.00 --> 936.00]  And.
[936.00 --> 937.00]  And they should be.
[937.00 --> 938.00]  Hate for the video or hate for goat.
[938.00 --> 939.00]  Sure.
[939.00 --> 940.00]  When realistically.
[940.00 --> 941.00]  They're just.
[941.00 --> 942.00]  Incredibly frustrated.
[942.00 --> 943.00]  And also live.
[943.00 --> 945.00]  And maybe it wasn't channeled properly.
[945.00 --> 946.00]  So.
[946.00 --> 948.00]  Now that people have kind of cooled off a little bit.
[948.00 --> 951.00]  They've had some time to think about it more and stuff.
[951.00 --> 953.00]  The community is much more.
[953.00 --> 956.00]  Floatplane chat is giving us some interesting stuff here.
[956.00 --> 957.00]  Harry009 says.
[957.00 --> 959.00]  Axel did a poll about the video.
[959.00 --> 964.00]  And 41% of respondents said they were planning to leave Tarkov as a result.
[964.00 --> 966.00]  Here's one thing I will say to that though.
[966.00 --> 967.00]  Is.
[967.00 --> 968.00]  If.
[968.00 --> 971.00]  That degree of rampant cheating.
[971.00 --> 973.00]  Is making it so you don't want to play Tarkov.
[973.00 --> 975.00]  I got some bad news for you.
[975.00 --> 976.00]  A little screw for like almost any shooter.
[976.00 --> 977.00]  Yeah.
[977.00 --> 979.00]  Because just about any game.
[979.00 --> 980.00]  Yeah.
[980.00 --> 981.00]  Probably not any better.
[981.00 --> 982.00]  Multiplayer.
[982.00 --> 983.00]  I think that in Tarkov.
[983.00 --> 985.00]  Cheating tilts the scales.
[985.00 --> 986.00]  The impact is a lot heavier.
[986.00 --> 988.00]  Maybe more than some other games.
[988.00 --> 991.00]  Like if I'm playing like a team based shooter.
[991.00 --> 992.00]  You know really good tactics.
[992.00 --> 995.00]  You could probably take down one cheater.
[995.00 --> 997.00]  Depending on the degree to which they are cheating.
[997.00 --> 998.00]  Like an aim bot is not enough.
[998.00 --> 1001.00]  You know in something like an overwatch.
[1001.00 --> 1002.00]  Um.
[1002.00 --> 1003.00]  But.
[1004.00 --> 1005.00]  What does this.
[1005.00 --> 1006.00]  On the other end of the spectrum.
[1006.00 --> 1008.00]  A ability to see through walls.
[1008.00 --> 1010.00]  Without any aim bot or anything in Tarkov.
[1010.00 --> 1011.00]  Is way more than enough.
[1011.00 --> 1012.00]  Yes.
[1012.00 --> 1013.00]  Yeah that's true.
[1013.00 --> 1014.00]  That's true.
[1014.00 --> 1015.00]  But I.
[1015.00 --> 1016.00]  I.
[1016.00 --> 1017.00]  Okay.
[1017.00 --> 1018.00]  Let me.
[1018.00 --> 1019.00]  Let me.
[1019.00 --> 1020.00]  Let me.
[1020.00 --> 1022.00]  Kind of pitch this question to you.
[1022.00 --> 1023.00]  What does this revelation mean.
[1023.00 --> 1024.00]  For the future of gaming in general.
[1024.00 --> 1025.00]  Okay.
[1025.00 --> 1026.00]  Multiplayer.
[1026.00 --> 1027.00]  Is it fair for me to say.
[1027.00 --> 1028.00]  That it's less fun.
[1028.00 --> 1029.00]  Than it was.
[1029.00 --> 1030.00]  Years ago.
[1030.00 --> 1031.00]  It feels like it.
[1031.00 --> 1032.00]  I don't know if that's because of the.
[1032.00 --> 1033.00]  Are you.
[1033.00 --> 1034.00]  Are you getting old.
[1034.00 --> 1035.00]  Yeah.
[1035.00 --> 1036.00]  Is gaming changing.
[1036.00 --> 1037.00]  Yeah.
[1037.00 --> 1038.00]  Yeah.
[1038.00 --> 1039.00]  Yeah.
[1039.00 --> 1040.00]  Yeah.
[1040.00 --> 1041.00]  Yeah.
[1041.00 --> 1042.00]  Yeah.
[1042.00 --> 1043.00]  Yeah.
[1043.00 --> 1044.00]  Yeah.
[1044.00 --> 1045.00]  Yeah.
[1045.00 --> 1046.00]  Yeah.
[1046.00 --> 1047.00]  Yeah.
[1047.00 --> 1048.00]  Yeah.
[1048.00 --> 1049.00]  Yeah.
[1049.00 --> 1050.00]  Yeah.
[1050.00 --> 1051.00]  Yeah.
[1051.00 --> 1052.00]  Yeah.
[1052.00 --> 1053.00]  Yeah.
[1053.00 --> 1054.00]  Yeah.
[1054.00 --> 1055.00]  Yeah.
[1055.00 --> 1056.00]  Yeah.
[1056.00 --> 1057.00]  Yeah.
[1057.00 --> 1058.00]  Yeah.
[1058.00 --> 1059.00]  It's.
[1059.00 --> 1060.00]  Yeah.
[1060.00 --> 1061.00]  Yeah.
[1061.00 --> 1062.00]  It's gaming changing.
[1062.00 --> 1063.00]  Sure.
[1063.00 --> 1064.00]  Or is it that rampant cheating.
[1064.00 --> 1065.00]  Is not fun.
[1065.00 --> 1066.00]  Because cheating was a thing.
[1066.00 --> 1067.00]  When we were growing up.
[1067.00 --> 1068.00]  Sure.
[1068.00 --> 1069.00]  But it was way harder.
[1069.00 --> 1070.00]  Yeah.
[1070.00 --> 1071.00]  Like now.
[1071.00 --> 1072.00]  Now.
[1072.00 --> 1073.00]  He.
[1073.00 --> 1074.00]  I believe goat said five minutes.
[1074.00 --> 1075.00]  He googled it.
[1075.00 --> 1077.00]  And then within five minutes he had it running.
[1077.00 --> 1078.00]  Yeah.
[1078.00 --> 1079.00]  Because you can just.
[1079.00 --> 1080.00]  You can just pay for it.
[1080.00 --> 1081.00]  You can basically.
[1081.00 --> 1082.00]  It's.
[1082.00 --> 1083.00]  It's a.
[1083.00 --> 1084.00]  Hire a service that will get you up and running.
[1084.00 --> 1085.00]  And they have like.
[1085.00 --> 1086.00]  Weekend sales and.
[1086.00 --> 1087.00]  Yeah.
[1087.00 --> 1091.98]  Fledged business. It's not like weird sketchy forums anymore. Okay, so multiplayer
[1093.36 --> 1095.82]  Okay, single player. I mean
[1096.96 --> 1102.14]  Probably the only notable. Okay, I'm trying to think notable single player
[1102.54 --> 1106.54]  Experiences that have come out for PC in the last little while. Okay, we've got your stray
[1106.68 --> 1114.02]  We've got it, which must not be named. Yeah, we've got other it which must not be named. There's two of them. Sure. Yeah, the other one
[1114.02 --> 1120.74]  Single player has outside of major blockbuster releases or
[1121.34 --> 1128.50]  Your odd kind of low budget or or indie breakout have been has has just been
[1128.96 --> 1135.70]  Ravaged by unprofitability because how many years ago was fallout 4 yeah, it's been 12 years since the last Elder Scrolls
[1135.70 --> 1137.50]  Yeah, and and it's not like
[1137.94 --> 1142.30]  It's one of those things where we can we can point at it and say well
[1142.30 --> 1148.68]  It's because of the proliferation of mobile gaming for example or like gotcha or like pay to win
[1148.68 --> 1155.34]  Pay to win strategies from game developers, but a big part of that I think a lot of game developers are more passionate about creating
[1156.18 --> 1162.02]  Better more enriching gaming experiences and I think it's pretty obvious that with single player games where there is absolutely
[1162.54 --> 1165.96]  no online verification and no incentive to
[1165.96 --> 1169.34]  To to to pay for it if you can just
[1169.34 --> 1172.34]  Play the exact same experience by yourself for nothing
[1172.34 --> 1176.34]  I think it's pretty clear that they're more prone to piracy. Yeah, so
[1176.96 --> 1179.46]  What's going to be left?
[1180.46 --> 1186.42]  I don't know some people just settle ring like there's there's definitely some other games, but oh, yeah, that's that was last year though
[1186.42 --> 1191.62]  Come on. It's been a bit and I don't mean like okay. I don't mean last year like it was
[1193.70 --> 1197.36]  64 days ago or whatever I mean that was a long time ago now
[1197.36 --> 1201.80]  I think it's beginning of last year was yes wasn't it genuinely almost a year ago. I think it was so. Yeah, yeah
[1202.56 --> 1208.48]  Yeah, angry birds angry birds will be the last game standing yeah, it's rough. I think my
[1208.48 --> 1216.64]  When this first happened so on the last show I brought up wanting a replay system and I still want a replay system
[1217.04 --> 1221.52]  But like in Tarkov coming back to Tarkov. Yeah, I mean it helps the maze yes
[1221.52 --> 1227.82]  So that's but with Tarkov the consequences of dying are so much higher that if anything
[1227.82 --> 1236.42]  I would think a replay system would push more people to quit the game, which is probably why they haven't done it in in in team fortress 2
[1236.42 --> 1238.84]  Oh, you see the cheaters or what? Yeah
[1238.84 --> 1246.78]  If you see someone who's cheating and obviously their mouse cursor whipped over to you and they freaking headshot you as you barely come around a corner
[1247.30 --> 1251.54]  Obviously you're mad, but it's like I'm a switch class. I'm a sneak up on them
[1252.74 --> 1260.90]  There's like certain things you could do you could lose a hundred dollars like real-world dollars worth of gear in in one instance
[1260.90 --> 1266.74]  And it's not like you could get it back and considering the amount of real money trading going on in Tarkov that might actually be very true
[1266.74 --> 1268.74]  Exactly. That's what I'm talking about
[1268.74 --> 1270.98]  I have no idea what the values are
[1270.98 --> 1277.30]  But so there's some ideas behind the replay system and how you could get the gear back one of them is if you
[1277.86 --> 1282.90]  Replay and watch a cheater kill you and you report them and then that cheater gets banned
[1283.22 --> 1285.78]  Your gear from that raid could get returned to you
[1285.78 --> 1292.74]  Okay, so there's some ideas to make it a little bit more amicable my thing that i've more landed on now is
[1293.38 --> 1295.38]  I just think
[1295.70 --> 1297.70]  People need to
[1298.42 --> 1304.42]  Care a lot more about anti-cheat and it needs to be more important and the
[1305.06 --> 1307.54]  Approach that companies take to it need to be
[1308.18 --> 1309.22]  more like
[1309.22 --> 1314.42]  Multi-pronged and I think that's the main reason why I want right a replay system is so that like
[1315.22 --> 1316.74]  We can help like
[1317.46 --> 1321.78]  I like the idea of the community being able to have because right now in Tarkov
[1322.74 --> 1324.34]  And I think I brought this up last week
[1324.34 --> 1324.66]  Sure
[1324.66 --> 1328.18]  Say you're approaching a building and you hear someone inside and then you just randomly die
[1328.82 --> 1333.86]  Yeah, you might think like oh that guy's cheating. He shot me through the wall or whatever. Maybe it was someone on a hill
[1334.50 --> 1337.94]  Yeah, fought 400 meters away that just shot you you have no idea
[1337.94 --> 1343.86]  So if you can watch a replay system, it might get rid of a bunch of junk reports of people that aren't cheating
[1344.02 --> 1344.98]  Yeah, so that
[1345.62 --> 1350.26]  Whatever developer whether it's bsg or some really focus on the real problem focus on the real stuff
[1350.58 --> 1353.78]  So I don't I don't think it's gonna solve the problem. I don't think it's some magic bullet
[1353.78 --> 1355.70]  And I do think it would help in tarkov
[1356.58 --> 1361.30]  Rather than invest I I think it actually obviously you want to invest a little bit in
[1361.30 --> 1365.06]  In actual you know background process, you know anti-cheat or whatever else
[1365.62 --> 1373.70]  But because so much of the value of an account is tied up in the items that that account holds
[1374.58 --> 1376.58]  I I could actually see
[1379.62 --> 1386.34]  Banning players as being extremely effective to reduce cheating if you have the tools like replays
[1386.34 --> 1388.90]  That will allow the community to root these people out
[1389.54 --> 1390.02]  um
[1390.02 --> 1393.06]  I I think it would help losing losing hundreds of dollars
[1393.06 --> 1397.06]  And if they and if they can figure out a system where they serialize essentially
[1397.54 --> 1403.70]  You know guns and and other equipment so that they can see the path that it's following and basically just go like yeah
[1403.70 --> 1406.74]  Look, we're gonna get we're gonna get merciless here
[1407.30 --> 1413.78]  Social credit system, uh, if you are if you are trading with cheaters regularly, you will be banned
[1413.78 --> 1415.46]  So they've actually started doing that. Yeah
[1415.46 --> 1421.22]  Apparently they said in an ama they're working on a replay system as well. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, uh, okay
[1421.22 --> 1424.66]  So we'll get to things they've said in a second. That's um, but
[1425.38 --> 1426.82]  uh, but
[1426.98 --> 1428.66]  Oh, what was I just gonna say?
[1428.66 --> 1429.14]  Oh, right
[1429.14 --> 1433.30]  They they have started banning and this has actually happened to a bunch of content creators
[1433.86 --> 1436.58]  Because it's there's there's this thing called viewer kits
[1437.54 --> 1440.42]  So it's you you enter a raid with nothing on you
[1440.58 --> 1445.38]  So you enter a game with nothing on you and you join in with a viewer and the viewer
[1445.94 --> 1447.30]  dumps a bunch of stuff for you
[1448.42 --> 1453.38]  But you don't know like what it's gonna be and then you pick it all up and then usually you kill them and then you have to
[1454.10 --> 1458.82]  survive the rest of the raid with whatever whatever gear they gave you and usually it's like pretty meme-y
[1459.22 --> 1464.34]  Sure, they'll give you like one bullet and like 30 flashbangs or something and you have to like try to figure it out and
[1465.06 --> 1469.06]  But sometimes they'll be like really baller kits, but you don't know right?
[1469.06 --> 1471.06]  It's coming in random from your
[1471.78 --> 1477.78]  Sometimes the people giving you stuff are people who have cheated or engaged in real money trading or rmt
[1478.10 --> 1478.90]  Yeah
[1478.90 --> 1484.74]  Stuff in the past and bsg has started banning certain creators that have had that interaction happen
[1485.62 --> 1487.38]  because they're trying to ban people that
[1488.34 --> 1493.94]  Play with cheaters or people that interact with other rmt type systems and stuff and that has gotten really muddy
[1494.42 --> 1495.78]  Because some of the creators are like well
[1496.82 --> 1499.22]  This whole viewer kit thing was allowed for like years
[1500.66 --> 1503.62]  And dropping things for each other has been fine
[1504.42 --> 1504.90]  forever
[1506.26 --> 1509.70]  So like now this is bannable right but then it's
[1510.50 --> 1514.50]  We're asking them to work on getting rid of cheaters and this is one of the ways to do it
[1514.50 --> 1516.50]  I've even said on wanshow like people should start
[1517.06 --> 1518.50]  Games just start banning people that play with cheaters
[1518.50 --> 1524.42]  Yeah, but then it's an issue with tarkov because tarkov has those open lobbies you've seen them. Yeah, but you can just
[1524.98 --> 1529.06]  Random people right? Yeah. Yeah, so like if you can invite random people
[1530.26 --> 1532.50]  They can't have that as a mechanic in the game anymore
[1532.50 --> 1534.02]  But you're gonna ban people to play with cheaters
[1534.02 --> 1536.66]  Okay to play with them just don't take any equipment from them
[1536.66 --> 1540.98]  So that's but then that needs to be communicated and like and that's gonna be tough and it's adding
[1541.30 --> 1547.86]  I mean if there's any community that could probably work around and do the research to figure out this kind of arcane bull
[1548.50 --> 1550.50]  Yeah
[1551.22 --> 1553.22]  Probably fair enough. Yeah
[1553.86 --> 1560.66]  But like it's just I mean tarkov is the gaming equivalent of having like the most tedious job ever as far as I can tell
[1561.94 --> 1565.30]  And we don't even we just do everything for him and he still thinks that
[1566.50 --> 1568.50]  Brutal it's brutal
[1569.62 --> 1573.06]  Even just the inventory management, okay, so you got look at this
[1573.06 --> 1578.22]  Okay, so you got some med pack or something that takes up four inventory squares and you've got some
[1578.54 --> 1583.82]  Bullet or something that's sitting in one of otherwise four blank inventory squares
[1583.82 --> 1586.46]  If I take that med pack and I just drop it there
[1586.78 --> 1591.34]  It doesn't just grab the bullet and put it in my hand and leave the med pack so that I can rearrange
[1591.82 --> 1594.30]  It just won't put it down and I'm sitting here going
[1595.02 --> 1597.74]  literal actual f***ing Diablo 1
[1598.62 --> 1606.06]  Had that quality of life mechanic where if you dropped a large item onto a space that only has one item occupying it
[1606.06 --> 1608.06]  It'll just put the other one in your hand
[1608.06 --> 1610.06]  Diablo 1
[1610.06 --> 1612.06]  1996
[1612.94 --> 1613.18]  Yeah
[1613.90 --> 1614.54]  Pretty rough
[1614.54 --> 1619.90]  So, okay, so Nikita or the I believe COO and like main
[1621.18 --> 1625.02]  Outword communicator sure from bsg the developer behind tarkov. Yeah
[1625.02 --> 1625.58]  Um
[1625.58 --> 1630.78]  Has started communicating a lot since this happened
[1631.66 --> 1637.66]  The first reach out was six days ago in a reddit thread called hackers cheaters and other related scum of the earth
[1638.30 --> 1640.30]  Um and scum you say and he posts
[1640.30 --> 1641.42]  Deplorables
[1641.42 --> 1644.22]  He posts a bunch of stuff which all sounds really good
[1644.78 --> 1646.78]  Except people noticed
[1646.94 --> 1648.78]  Immediately that he had made
[1649.26 --> 1657.10]  Basically the exact same post not only two years ago, but also three years ago and they were like
[1657.98 --> 1659.98]  borderline
[1659.98 --> 1661.98]  Identical like they're so
[1662.62 --> 1665.58]  Similar and people pointed out on your screen right now
[1665.58 --> 1670.46]  Uh, I can show the so this is the comment that I saw yeah, you can show my screen
[1670.54 --> 1672.86]  This is the comment that I saw from liisin
[1673.10 --> 1678.62]  L-i-i-s-n who posts out the two years ago and three years ago threads and this is the thread from
[1679.10 --> 1679.74]  uh
[1679.74 --> 1686.46]  Nikita or train fender. I don't know that uh that talks about the things that they're gonna do for anti-cheating
[1686.78 --> 1694.70]  Here's the three years ago post which is like extremely extremely similar and here's the oh, this is part two that he posted part
[1694.70 --> 1697.50]  Two is actually significantly more interesting and
[1698.46 --> 1702.14]  He has communicated in like an ama and a bunch of other type of stuff
[1703.66 --> 1706.22]  In ways that that seem pretty good if they actually do this stuff
[1706.78 --> 1712.06]  And it hasn't been enough time for them to really actually do anything right because like it takes time to develop stuff
[1712.06 --> 1716.06]  So i'm not sitting here imagining that they would actually be able to act on a lot of this
[1716.54 --> 1717.58]  uh
[1717.58 --> 1724.38]  That quickly they've tried doing some stuff very reactionary, but it's mostly changing like properties and parameters and different items
[1724.38 --> 1727.26]  Like things that wouldn't take that long because it hasn't been that long
[1727.82 --> 1728.14]  um
[1729.26 --> 1730.78]  but yeah
[1730.78 --> 1733.10]  Reaction to his first post was super negative
[1733.10 --> 1740.94]  But then he's kept communicating since then and refined on things and then it's gotten more positive and the community's just going all over
[1740.94 --> 1741.26]  the place
[1741.26 --> 1746.86]  Yeah, pyro pinky uh points out that battle state games games needs cheaters to help fund development
[1746.86 --> 1750.22]  Dr. Lupo apparently has a great clip on why it's happening and will keep happening
[1750.22 --> 1754.62]  I mean, it's uh, it's a very similar if I if I had to guess I haven't actually watched it yet
[1755.10 --> 1756.70]  I haven't even read the comments under it
[1756.70 --> 1759.42]  If I had to guess i'd say it's very similar to the way that valve
[1759.90 --> 1765.82]  um, you know is really doesn't like you know cash cash sales of skins and and everything else but
[1767.34 --> 1772.06]  Functionally does nothing to actually stop people from gambling on them and spending money on them
[1772.06 --> 1774.70]  So the tarkov because without cash
[1775.50 --> 1776.94]  It's it's it's like anything
[1776.94 --> 1782.06]  Without a cash value. It doesn't have a value
[1782.54 --> 1787.66]  There is no actual intrinsic value to any digital item. It has to have a cash value
[1787.90 --> 1789.90]  So as soon as you completely
[1790.62 --> 1796.30]  Shut down people's ability to trade these items through some kind of marketplace you destroy the value
[1797.10 --> 1797.42]  um
[1798.46 --> 1802.06]  Now, I don't know if dr lupo makes some other different points about it, but that's
[1802.06 --> 1804.06]  That's
[1804.06 --> 1809.66]  That's a very sort of basic overview of why it is in a game developers best interest
[1810.38 --> 1814.70]  For people to exchange real world money for skins and in-game items
[1815.34 --> 1820.94]  There's there's no other like financial trading through tarkov though. There's there's an argument that has been made
[1821.66 --> 1828.14]  That these cheaters get banned a lot. I believe nikita made some post saying that they they banned over like 4 000 cheaters
[1828.14 --> 1831.58]  Just over the weekend. Yeah, but is that that okay in a weekend? I guess that's a lot
[1832.30 --> 1837.90]  Some things to consider there is they may have made their parameters a little bit more aggressive in response to the video
[1838.30 --> 1841.98]  So it may have cast a wider net and that may have been a one-time increase
[1841.98 --> 1845.02]  I don't really know I haven't read all of his posts and all that kind of stuff again
[1845.26 --> 1850.22]  I'm not even playing right now. So like my amount of care is not the absolute highest sure
[1850.46 --> 1852.46]  um, but
[1852.46 --> 1857.10]  So it really is just about you getting more exposure for yourself in his video
[1859.58 --> 1864.78]  No, as far as I can tell no one even watched that that's why you should it should not have been in there. I get it. Oh my goodness
[1864.78 --> 1866.78]  I didn't even know it was in there anyways, um
[1868.62 --> 1871.66]  Okay, so there is technically financial reward for them
[1872.22 --> 1875.66]  If the cheaters keep buying accounts that is technically true
[1876.38 --> 1879.90]  Now there's some questions as to whether people are buying them at full value
[1879.90 --> 1884.54]  Because I don't know if it's still a thing, but I know for a while market you could you could buy them
[1884.62 --> 1889.26]  You could like vpn into a different country and buy it in that local currency and it was way way way cheaper
[1889.66 --> 1894.30]  Um, but still resell those accounts at the volume that people are buying these accounts
[1894.86 --> 1896.22]  It's gonna be a pretty substantial amount
[1896.22 --> 1902.62]  So the argument then is that they want to ban cheaters to continue to get more account purchases
[1902.62 --> 1908.94]  But they don't want to ban them too well because they want them to be able to make more money than they're spending
[1909.26 --> 1912.70]  On accounts with battle state because if they're if they're cheating in order to rmt
[1913.10 --> 1916.46]  They need to make enough money to pay for the account and make it worth their time
[1916.78 --> 1918.78]  So this is an argument that has been made
[1919.98 --> 1927.26]  That would be right some very impressive 4d chess if they are able to balance that perfectly. I mean look at
[1927.26 --> 1930.62]  It doesn't even need to be perfect though
[1931.58 --> 1935.18]  I I I I don't I don't know I I could see it
[1935.90 --> 1939.26]  I don't think it's 4d chess. I could see it being an incentive to
[1940.78 --> 1942.94]  Not want to invest
[1944.14 --> 1951.90]  Way too much more. Yeah, I don't think it's a matter of 4d chess like like min maxing their investment into anti-cheat
[1952.14 --> 1954.14]  I think it's more about
[1954.14 --> 1956.86]  Minimizing their investment into anti-cheat
[1956.86 --> 1963.18]  Just focusing on others. Yeah, so the threshold is not set by whether these guys can stay profitable. That's a happy accident
[1963.82 --> 1967.34]  the threshold is set by just account sales and
[1968.14 --> 1970.14]  a real player attrition
[1970.14 --> 1970.94]  um
[1970.94 --> 1977.18]  Where people are not playing the game anymore, which which would hurt the value of the real money trading. Yeah, so right
[1977.18 --> 1980.70]  So it's there's no different. It's a different like formula
[1980.86 --> 1982.86]  But we end up with the same result
[1982.86 --> 1987.50]  I guess is what i'm trying to say maybe which is that they are not investing enough into anti-cheat
[1987.74 --> 1992.06]  I personally don't believe they're investing enough into anti-cheat. I don't think there's any way to
[1992.86 --> 1996.14]  Prove or to state that that's the reason why if that makes sense
[1996.54 --> 2004.14]  Like we we have no idea. Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. I think it's a very dangerous game to play if that is the game that they're playing
[2004.14 --> 2006.14]  Yeah, um
[2006.22 --> 2012.22]  What I suspect is they just don't find working on anti-cheat very interesting because as far as my understanding goes
[2012.46 --> 2014.94]  Working on anti-cheat is insanely difficult
[2015.58 --> 2017.98]  Right, and it's not very publicly rewarding
[2018.54 --> 2021.10]  Unless something like this is going on sure
[2021.34 --> 2024.78]  So something like this is going on work on anti-cheat post your numbers
[2024.78 --> 2030.78]  And people are going to praise you and come back to the game, but if something like this is not going on if nobody's angry about cheaters
[2030.78 --> 2036.22]  Then nobody's talking about anti-cheat and working on anti-cheat doesn't bring you any benefit to your game, right?
[2036.22 --> 2040.86]  So I could see it. I could see yeah, I could see it being more based on that sure
[2041.26 --> 2045.50]  Because if if there isn't and there's a lot of problems with tarkov
[2046.62 --> 2052.06]  So people aren't screaming about cheaters right now. Well, you have like one of the biggest desync problems of any shooter game
[2052.06 --> 2056.30]  Um, right should probably work on that you have tons of other issues
[2057.10 --> 2058.62]  That like demand
[2059.42 --> 2060.94]  Work there's lots
[2061.74 --> 2063.66]  Tarkov is so wide scope
[2064.86 --> 2069.02]  That you could watch like any tarkov creator talk to anyone who plays the game
[2069.50 --> 2075.58]  Go on any forum that talks about anything and see suggestions in every possible direction that are great
[2076.06 --> 2079.50]  The the the potential backlog for this game is insane, right?
[2079.50 --> 2081.98]  Like you you talk about how complicated some of the systems are
[2082.06 --> 2084.54]  They don't have to be that complicated to have the same depth
[2085.10 --> 2087.98]  Right like gearing up before a raid is always super annoying
[2088.30 --> 2092.38]  What if you had you guys seem to enjoy it? It's sort of sick to watch. I feel like i'm like
[2093.02 --> 2095.74]  Watching your like your like private enjoyment time, you know
[2096.38 --> 2100.14]  The way you guys will sit and tinker with your different bullets and your different magazines
[2100.70 --> 2102.22]  You gotta make sure you bring the right stuff
[2102.22 --> 2103.90]  There's definitely a perverse pleasure there
[2104.78 --> 2107.02]  Okay, sure, but if you could do that
[2107.02 --> 2109.50]  How much you hate it and then like put it on a mannequin
[2110.22 --> 2115.66]  So that if you die with your buddies you just like grab the mannequin stuff and it just all automatically goes on your character
[2115.66 --> 2117.26]  So you can jump back in the game, right?
[2117.26 --> 2121.50]  You could spend time setting up your stuff when you're not actively playing with your friends. Which you definitely do enjoy
[2121.90 --> 2123.34]  Yeah, um
[2123.42 --> 2127.10]  Then that would be great. That's a feature that has been recommended. I think that would be awesome
[2127.18 --> 2133.90]  It would also take development time development time is expensive and development time has massive opportunity costs because they could work on other stuff
[2133.90 --> 2139.18]  So like I think anti-cheat is just an unattractive thing to work on
[2140.54 --> 2142.54]  When people aren't mad about it
[2143.42 --> 2150.94]  That that I think is is probably more real than them like gaining money from the the the sales to cheaters
[2151.50 --> 2152.78]  um, but but I don't know
[2154.06 --> 2161.02]  So so yeah, it blew up and uh, you know great work great work goat on the video if you guys haven't checked it out
[2161.02 --> 2164.62]  Definitely worth a watch. It's a bit of a longer one
[2164.86 --> 2170.22]  Um in no small part because there's so much of luke talking in it, but uh, yeah definitely worth checking out
[2170.22 --> 2177.42]  Here's his channel and uh, you can you can really see the the impact of this the virality of this video
[2177.98 --> 2180.30]  34 000 views 1.4 million
[2181.02 --> 2183.82]  550 000 from four days ago. Oh, hey look. It's us
[2184.62 --> 2185.82]  Hey
[2185.82 --> 2186.38]  Nice
[2186.94 --> 2191.34]  Anywho, why don't we move on to our next topic today? Which is the millennial pause?
[2191.74 --> 2194.54]  Yeah, well, I am getting very tired of
[2195.18 --> 2197.58]  articles that just kind of talk about
[2198.46 --> 2201.90]  the differences between boomers and millennials or
[2202.62 --> 2203.82]  Gen Z
[2203.82 --> 2210.06]  Ne is is working differently in the workplace and here's the things that are special about gens
[2211.18 --> 2212.22]  I'm sitting here going like
[2212.22 --> 2216.62]  It just kind of hurts my brain because
[2217.50 --> 2219.10]  Because you're a millennial. I think we all
[2221.10 --> 2229.66]  I think we all learned you know very very young that generalizing just putting people into into buckets like this
[2230.06 --> 2235.18]  Uh is is not constructive. I think that you can definitely have conversations about
[2236.06 --> 2242.46]  You know what the impact was of of a particular generation and of the the lifestyle that they led in general
[2242.46 --> 2246.06]  I mean, I think you can you can look at the the the wealth
[2246.54 --> 2247.42]  the the
[2249.34 --> 2249.66]  the
[2249.66 --> 2251.50]  the the the numerous
[2251.50 --> 2251.90]  uh
[2251.90 --> 2259.34]  Or just the the sheer scale of the baby boomer generation and the amount of of wealth that it captured and and continues to hold the power that it
[2259.34 --> 2264.78]  Captured and continues to hold and you can kind of go like yeah, they they were extremely influential
[2265.42 --> 2268.78]  But to kind of go, you know, okay boomer essentially
[2269.26 --> 2276.86]  Um and to and to be dismissive of boomers like i've met boomers that are anywhere from completely technically illiterate
[2277.26 --> 2278.22]  to
[2278.22 --> 2282.94]  being the people who literally invented the computer technology that you and I all enjoy today
[2283.02 --> 2285.90]  The internet yeah, right like that that that
[2285.90 --> 2291.82]  That that basically all boomers right just by and all of this development was happening and how how old that generation was
[2292.14 --> 2295.90]  And in the same way, you know, I'll run into zoomers that are anywhere from
[2296.70 --> 2298.54]  computer whiz kids to
[2299.66 --> 2301.66]  kind of me going
[2301.66 --> 2303.66]  Did they have the internet when you grew up?
[2305.26 --> 2307.26]  Couldn't you have just googled this? I don't know. Yeah
[2309.02 --> 2311.02]  Why are we having this conversation?
[2311.02 --> 2312.94]  Um anyway, one of one of the dumb
[2312.94 --> 2320.46]  I guess I made the mistake of clicking on too many of these because I I am interested particularly in sort of uh
[2320.94 --> 2322.86]  Office and and workplace
[2323.42 --> 2332.46]  um accommodation and yeah, yeah, exactly like you know management techniques and that sort of thing and a lot of them are really focused right now
[2332.46 --> 2335.82]  Yes, Conrad said in chat. I'm a zoomer. I have to I have to deal with him
[2335.82 --> 2340.38]  Yeah, I gotta click on these on on gen z entering the workplace and all the ways that
[2340.38 --> 2348.14]  Gen z is different and whether it's your your your quiet quitting or your you know, whatever whatever else right like whatever workplace
[2348.38 --> 2354.62]  Trends are are happening and really as far as I can tell trends are less about what's actually happening broadly and more about what's
[2355.02 --> 2359.74]  Happening loudly on twitter or on tick-tock. Yeah, but that that's a whole separate conversation
[2360.46 --> 2362.94]  Anyway, I guess i've clicked on too many of these articles
[2362.94 --> 2368.78]  Uh, and I got one that I came across that just felt like the stupidest thing ever
[2368.78 --> 2373.42]  And i'm about to out myself as a dumb out of touch millennial, but I learned recently
[2373.90 --> 2376.46]  Uh, what the millennial pause is called is
[2377.18 --> 2381.98]  Are you familiar with the millennial pause so other than you saying it before the show? No, i've never heard of this okay
[2382.46 --> 2387.10]  The millennial pause is a short pause before you start
[2387.66 --> 2394.38]  Speaking when you're recording a video so if you were say recording a selfie for tick-tock you would go
[2395.34 --> 2397.66]  Okay, hold on. Let me just open up my camera here
[2400.06 --> 2402.86]  No, well, I got to turn my selfie camera. Sorry. I'm a dumb millennial
[2402.86 --> 2409.66]  So my default camera position is the rear camera. Yeah, like some kind of chump. Okay, so I would basically go like this
[2409.66 --> 2415.82]  The thing about luke's shameless self-promotion in that tarkov video is that
[2416.38 --> 2420.22]  He has every opportunity to promote himself. I mean he's on this podcast every week
[2420.22 --> 2422.22]  It's one of the biggest tech podcasts in the world
[2422.54 --> 2428.30]  So I just don't know why he can't be honest with me about the reason that he's talking about this goat creator and this tarkov thing
[2428.30 --> 2430.94]  It's just what he wants more followers for his youtube channel
[2430.94 --> 2434.70]  I pretty much promised that channel's never going to take off no matter how hard he works on it
[2434.70 --> 2439.18]  So if he needs more money, why doesn't he just ask for it? It's pathetic
[2440.70 --> 2445.26]  And end okay, my only affiliation in that channel was this by the way
[2448.70 --> 2454.30]  All right, so yeah, the pause at the beginning of this. Okay, hold on hold on. Okay, stop
[2454.94 --> 2456.94]  So we go back to the beginning
[2458.54 --> 2463.26]  That pause that half a second. Oh sure. Sorry. I'll show the people. I'll show the people okay
[2463.26 --> 2465.26]  The millennial not showing
[2465.50 --> 2468.14]  That pause where I blink and inhale
[2468.78 --> 2470.54]  That's the millennial pause
[2472.22 --> 2472.54]  And
[2473.34 --> 2478.86]  The the article goes on to explain that with zoomers they will just be talking already
[2479.90 --> 2485.42]  When the video starts so I was gonna say for like a live stream would we just be mid conversation when it starts?
[2485.50 --> 2487.90]  So that's what i'm talking about i'm looking at this going
[2488.38 --> 2492.94]  I don't know this is better. I don't know that this is a generational difference as much as it might just be a
[2492.94 --> 2498.30]  Tech savvy difference because I know that until the tally light is on my camera's not recording. Yeah
[2499.10 --> 2502.54]  But then ain't nobody got time for me to blink and inhale I guess
[2505.50 --> 2510.70]  So what do I make of this kind of what I was wondering is like do they just edit their videos better or
[2511.82 --> 2515.26]  No, apparently it is some combination of
[2516.14 --> 2517.74]  not caring and
[2517.74 --> 2525.74]  Knowing the exact timing of when your device will start recording so that you are just talking the instant
[2526.30 --> 2528.30]  It starts recording so for us
[2528.30 --> 2532.14]  We would just have to not care because we actually can't know the exact time
[2532.86 --> 2537.10]  Yeah, well, I mean I use so many different kinds of camera like as a as a creator
[2537.50 --> 2540.38]  I well, no because this is a live sync thing
[2541.18 --> 2543.18]  You don't know until that
[2543.18 --> 2550.70]  Socializes oh, I don't even mean wancho. I'm just talking in general just like any video. I I I promise you as as a content creator
[2550.70 --> 2556.62]  I will never not millennial pause because it's what what i'm gonna do another take because
[2557.34 --> 2563.82]  Something wasn't recording properly. Jaden said in flow plane chat millennials lean more youtube zoomers lead more tick tock different time
[2563.98 --> 2570.86]  Expectations and constraints that was my understanding too. And then I read an article recently. Yeah that showed that while
[2570.86 --> 2576.94]  They do watch a lot more tick tock. They actually watch more youtube than they do tick tock
[2577.58 --> 2579.50]  I don't know if that's real
[2581.50 --> 2587.10]  It was surprising to me it might not be legit. I think it was a survey more than like an actual
[2587.82 --> 2591.34]  Data based thing so maybe it's not legit. I don't know
[2591.66 --> 2596.30]  But I just want to throw it out there because it's very surprising to me. Yeah, so hocks are in float plane chat says it's that
[2596.30 --> 2599.74]  Millennials don't trust that the recording has started till they see it has started
[2599.74 --> 2603.66]  Which so they just trust immediately upon pressing the button that it started
[2604.54 --> 2610.54]  Which I guess makes sense because we would have grown up with far less reliable technology
[2611.10 --> 2618.46]  Like I okay a perfect example of this is that my note 9 my old phone had a little stylus a little uh bluetooth
[2618.86 --> 2623.58]  Stylus that had a little button on it that I could use as a remote shutter and one of the things I liked about it
[2623.58 --> 2627.66]  Most was that it meant that I could hold my phone with my rear camera
[2628.14 --> 2634.94]  Facing me so I could take much higher quality selfies because I didn't have to be able to reach around and get at the shutter button
[2635.18 --> 2638.38]  Or even hold it awkwardly so I you know had could reach the volume button
[2638.38 --> 2640.38]  I could just hold it in a way that was comfortable
[2640.86 --> 2644.38]  You know put the arm around the misses and and you know click click click click click click click
[2645.10 --> 2646.30]  but
[2646.30 --> 2649.18]  Because I don't trust technology. I'd be like don't move
[2650.06 --> 2652.06]  Yeah, did it actually take yeah
[2652.78 --> 2657.18]  No, it didn't because freaking 10% of the time. It just doesn't right so
[2657.90 --> 2660.86]  Go get it ready again. Oh, like I don't know it
[2661.98 --> 2663.98]  Guys help me out here
[2664.14 --> 2667.02]  Apparently there's there's am I out of touch or is it the children?
[2667.02 --> 2669.74]  No, it's the children who are wrong right like I'm trying to figure this out
[2669.74 --> 2672.46]  There's a wikipedia article for millennial pause hit me
[2672.46 --> 2680.14]  The millennial pause is barely perceptible is a barely perceptible pause that is present at the start of some recorded videos sure
[2680.62 --> 2682.22]  Yeah, it's basically what we've already said. Yeah
[2684.38 --> 2687.90]  You don't do the millennial pause in your youtube videos because you have editors to cut it out. Yeah, absolutely
[2688.38 --> 2692.30]  So it's just that zoomers take an extra 30 seconds to cut the pause like is that what we're talking about?
[2693.10 --> 2695.74]  Yeah, this is funny. This is funny float plane chat. This is great
[2696.06 --> 2699.26]  Ben Mitchell says I didn't even know what this was until you said it
[2699.26 --> 2703.50]  And I now realize i've been doing it on apps like snapchat. So apparently it's cringe
[2704.62 --> 2709.74]  Millennial pause millennial pause is cringe. So you just got trusted. Yeah, your your your age is showing grandpa
[2710.46 --> 2712.46]  All right, I didn't know
[2712.70 --> 2717.18]  If you look at professional live productions, you can see the ways they accommodate this. Yeah, actually that's that's really true
[2717.42 --> 2720.38]  They don't have a pause because they'll do five four
[2722.62 --> 2725.10]  So that you just start immediately. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[2725.10 --> 2730.06]  Yeah, that's fair one of the reasons we can't do that on wanshow is that our dashboard
[2730.54 --> 2735.50]  Like our re-streamer you probably noticed that we stream wanshow on more than one platform. So that means
[2736.14 --> 2740.30]  Because you can only have to my knowledge one endpoint in obs
[2741.18 --> 2748.38]  Is that right? Okay, so because you can only stream to one destination we have to go through an intermediary
[2748.62 --> 2752.62]  Server we have to have an extra hop before we actually go live on those platforms
[2752.62 --> 2755.18]  So we go to our intermediary and then it splits out
[2755.74 --> 2760.06]  With all the different streams and all the different bit rates that are supported by the various platforms
[2760.94 --> 2768.70]  We are usually live for a while before we go live on youtube and the reason for that is that it's like the ultimate millennial pause
[2769.10 --> 2774.46]  You know, we'll be live for 20 minutes figuring out if there's any technical issues that we need to solve
[2774.86 --> 2776.62]  Uh kind of going okay. Yeah, we're gonna need to play
[2777.42 --> 2780.22]  Audio from my laptop this show. Let's make sure that's working
[2780.22 --> 2784.78]  Um, okay, yeah, everything good to go all the titles are right
[2784.78 --> 2790.06]  Like we'll do all of our our pre-checking while we're kind of live and testing audio levels and making sure that there's no glitchiness
[2790.62 --> 2791.74]  and
[2791.98 --> 2797.42]  When we press youtube and we and we spool up the re-streamer to go to youtube
[2798.14 --> 2800.30]  There is a different
[2800.30 --> 2801.50]  delay
[2801.50 --> 2808.78]  That what does it depend on? I actually have no idea because i've seen everything from as long as I kid you not about 15 seconds
[2808.78 --> 2811.66]  All the way to you remember that one time a couple months ago
[2812.22 --> 2816.78]  It was immediately live and I was caught totally unaware if you if you look back at that when show
[2817.18 --> 2819.90]  I don't remember exactly how quickly I adapted to it, but
[2820.70 --> 2824.78]  If I seem panicked at the beginning of that show it's because whoa, how did it go already?
[2824.78 --> 2829.26]  I was expecting to sit there refreshing the page anywhere from half a dozen to a dozen times
[2829.74 --> 2832.54]  To see that indicator go i've never bothered to look into like
[2832.54 --> 2838.94]  What's happening? It'd be kind of neat to yeah have it be consistent, but it's a pretty low priority in terms of development
[2838.94 --> 2841.26]  I think yeah, yeah, yeah, it's okay
[2842.54 --> 2847.50]  Um, so yeah, the the pre-show is kind of our our millennial pause and then at the beginning of the video because
[2847.90 --> 2853.50]  I have to wait for a refresh cycle of that page to know if the check is green
[2855.50 --> 2858.46]  I just so this is why I was saying I think the only solution yeah
[2858.46 --> 2861.82]  It would be for us to just not care because we would have to be mid-conversation
[2862.46 --> 2864.38]  And then you notice that it's live and then we go
[2864.94 --> 2866.62]  Yeah, that would be the only solution
[2867.34 --> 2868.30]  I don't like that
[2868.30 --> 2871.90]  I don't think it's a problem that needs a solution though. Yeah, yeah, I can just be millennial pausers
[2871.90 --> 2873.90]  I think are you technically a millennial?
[2874.30 --> 2876.30]  I think so would be like barely though, right?
[2876.54 --> 2879.02]  What's the what's the I don't know the cutoff who cares?
[2879.02 --> 2881.18]  Well, that's the thing right is it's all arbitrary
[2881.18 --> 2884.54]  Yeah, I think though that in this case it does a
[2885.34 --> 2887.98]  20 26 so you got to be 26
[2887.98 --> 2892.14]  So then yeah, you're definitely a millennial I identify as a millennial at the very least
[2892.62 --> 2895.90]  I've always like anytime I see anything that's like millennials have ruined
[2896.78 --> 2897.18]  uh
[2897.74 --> 2899.10]  plastic bags, I don't know
[2899.98 --> 2906.06]  I'll be like yep, that's probably me. I don't know. I always just any article that talks about millennials. I just assume it's my group
[2906.06 --> 2908.06]  I think I'm a pretty bog-standard millennial
[2908.94 --> 2909.82]  Yeah, yeah
[2910.54 --> 2913.90]  Millennials are apparently killing drinking is one of one of the new ones
[2914.86 --> 2916.46]  um so yeah, that's us
[2917.98 --> 2922.14]  Millennials stereotypes. Okay, let's let's have some fun millennials are lazy. I mean
[2923.10 --> 2927.58]  Wouldn't you be if you didn't have to do everything manually just because you walk to school, you know
[2927.90 --> 2931.58]  Uphill both ways doesn't mean I should do it. Yeah, it's supposed to be better, right?
[2931.58 --> 2934.54]  Isn't that the whole idea? It's supposed to be better things are supposed to improve
[2934.54 --> 2937.58]  Yeah, like now it's only uphill one way man good
[2937.58 --> 2939.90]  My mom did this thing where she got rid of her microwave
[2939.90 --> 2942.94]  Because it was like it was
[2943.90 --> 2949.82]  Making something dependence on you know, it was like too convenient and blah blah something
[2949.82 --> 2954.78]  I'm sitting here. I'm sitting here going like you're gonna have a microwave again in less than six months. I
[2955.66 --> 2957.66]  guarantee it sure enough
[2957.66 --> 2962.46]  I was a hundred percent right about that. Oh, yeah, yeah, of course they have a microwave now and anytime I bring it up
[2962.46 --> 2966.30]  It's like the subject is very quickly changed again
[2967.26 --> 2968.62]  Which I?
[2968.62 --> 2971.26]  Really enjoy because I I was I
[2971.90 --> 2975.02]  Don't know I sometimes I can be a very direct communicator
[2975.58 --> 2979.42]  I was extremely direct about that when I was like that's really stupid
[2979.66 --> 2983.10]  So you're just gonna take forever to heat things up for for what?
[2983.10 --> 2988.54]  I mean do we are we even going to talk about the fact that you're like burning fossil fuels in order to
[2989.02 --> 2993.18]  Heat things up on your gas stove probably not properly ventilated whatever like
[2993.90 --> 2995.90]  But probably not yeah
[2996.38 --> 2999.10]  Microwave is just plain good
[2999.66 --> 3002.38]  Um, yeah, okay millennials are technology obsessed
[3003.10 --> 3004.22]  Yeah, that's why not?
[3004.86 --> 3009.58]  It was we it's just better the internet happened like while we were growing up. That was a big deal
[3009.58 --> 3013.74]  Well, we're uniquely positioned to see the before and the after
[3014.22 --> 3021.10]  Right like when I was in grade two I still remember this stuff like you know how you can have like little snippets
[3021.82 --> 3025.74]  Right is valley speak like valley girl speak in here. No, it's not
[3026.38 --> 3027.74]  But like you know how you can
[3028.38 --> 3033.02]  Like have these little snippets of memory or like like little flashes, you know
[3033.02 --> 3037.98]  Like you don't really remember it, but it's like I know I did this report on boa constrictors
[3037.98 --> 3039.98]  Sure, sure. Why do I know that? Yeah
[3040.38 --> 3049.02]  It was in grade two and and I I can almost see my terrible illustration on on the cover of my duotang, you know, right?
[3050.14 --> 3057.58]  And I still remember the layout of my elementary school library and I still remember where the encyclopedias were
[3058.38 --> 3063.26]  Yeah, and the other reference books we did book reports
[3063.26 --> 3065.66]  from books like on nonfiction
[3067.18 --> 3069.10]  topics, right and
[3070.30 --> 3077.98]  By the time I was in grade it's like if someone else had the encyclopedia that you needed because there there would be like the encyclopedia would be a whole shelf
[3077.98 --> 3082.62]  Yeah, because it would be all alphabetized. Yeah, and if they had the letter or whatever you need it
[3082.62 --> 3088.54]  You just have to wait or my school had several encyclopedias only one relatively current
[3088.54 --> 3092.86]  So you could see if you could find any information in the older one. Yeah
[3093.50 --> 3097.50]  Other than that you were pretty much boned then I was in grade
[3098.06 --> 3100.14]  four five six when
[3100.70 --> 3106.54]  Encarta you know an encyclopedia on cd-rom became a thing that you could have yeah
[3107.18 --> 3111.98]  Then you fast forward just a couple of years later. And when was wikipedia founded?
[3111.98 --> 3116.70]  Well, you look that up apparently wikipedia claims that
[3117.34 --> 3125.10]  Millennials are people born from 1981 to 1996. Okay, so then wikipedia came along by the time I was in high school
[3125.66 --> 3127.90]  Wikipedia was a thing
[3128.54 --> 3133.66]  Was it perfectly trustworthy? Of course not. Is it perfectly trustworthy today? Of course not
[3134.30 --> 3137.42]  But it's certainly it is
[3137.42 --> 3144.22]  There is certainly a better place to start than cracking open a dusty tome. I will
[3144.86 --> 3146.86]  Promise you that right
[3146.86 --> 3149.74]  um, and then and then we lived through the
[3150.62 --> 3157.10]  The move from text to multimedia to video right so we've kind of video move was like kind of messy
[3157.34 --> 3161.74]  Because people think of it now as these like centralized things like there's okay. There's youtube
[3162.14 --> 3164.54]  There's I guess tick tock. There's facebook with video
[3164.54 --> 3169.82]  There's instagram with video whatnot at the beginning of video on the internet. It was just all these like random sure
[3170.38 --> 3171.58]  Yeah, like like
[3171.58 --> 3173.42]  see net with sure
[3173.42 --> 3176.54]  But even like think about justin tv before twitch. Yeah
[3177.50 --> 3183.66]  Like it was just a weird janky website that happened to support live video like it was not it was not corporatized
[3183.66 --> 3186.14]  It wasn't clean well, and it wasn't organized
[3186.38 --> 3190.38]  No, a lot of original video viewing grounds you would just download it
[3190.38 --> 3192.38]  Mm-hmm. You couldn't even watch it live
[3193.10 --> 3195.50]  You'd see all these thumbnails and you would download the whole video
[3195.50 --> 3198.14]  Where did people even watch like pure ownage? You know?
[3198.54 --> 3202.78]  Yeah, I think you had to download it. I think you had to download it and like the numa numa video. Yeah. Yeah
[3202.78 --> 3204.78]  Yeah, you just had to download that i'm pretty sure yep
[3205.10 --> 3208.46]  Like it was it was a very it's and people would share
[3209.90 --> 3216.30]  People would share stuff through just these like insane email chain letters that you would just see like forwarded like a million times. I
[3216.30 --> 3218.30]  I
[3218.30 --> 3224.06]  Never that was I was not on that train. That was an okay boomer thing for me. Yeah, sure sure. Yeah, for sure
[3224.62 --> 3227.58]  Okay, uh millennials are more socially responsible
[3228.62 --> 3229.58]  um
[3229.66 --> 3232.86]  Well, the word more is important. I think that
[3234.38 --> 3237.18]  I think that when it comes to mindless consumption
[3237.90 --> 3240.86]  I I definitely noticed more of it with my
[3241.98 --> 3246.22]  With my elders. Yeah, so is the is the more compared to like
[3246.30 --> 3251.66]  I love I love my family or gen x but my boomer relatives the way that they just buy
[3252.30 --> 3257.34]  Like the dumbest and just don't understand why I don't want it
[3257.90 --> 3264.22]  I feel like that's a frustration that I share with a lot of my peers gen x is 1965 to 1980
[3264.22 --> 3268.94]  And I guess boomers before that yeah from 1945 to 1965 in my experience
[3269.90 --> 3274.46]  From yeah from my experience boomers definitely a lot of mindless consumption gen x not so much
[3274.46 --> 3277.98]  Well, boomers had a lot parents
[3279.02 --> 3283.74]  Not a lot of mindless consumption. Yeah, okay. I mean it also I mean but that's the thing is right
[3284.14 --> 3290.30]  These are generalizations and there's always going to be individuals for sure. There's always going to be alternatives. I know plenty of millennials that just
[3290.78 --> 3292.46]  Mindlessly acquire. Oh, yeah
[3293.02 --> 3294.46]  Just acquire yep
[3294.46 --> 3298.46]  I mean the habits certain friends of mine go through that transition of like
[3299.02 --> 3300.86]  Where do they get their source of happiness? Okay?
[3300.86 --> 3304.38]  It's like sports or hanging out with their friends every day or whatever in high school or whatever it is
[3304.62 --> 3307.98]  And then they get a job they stop hanging out with their friends they stop playing sports
[3307.98 --> 3313.58]  And now it's just like buying things or like drinking alcohol or whatever like the the source of happiness shifts
[3313.58 --> 3319.34]  And for some piece people it goes to retail just retail therapy. Yeah, I heard of that. Yeah
[3319.66 --> 3320.06]  um
[3321.18 --> 3322.62]  Millennials are job hoppers
[3323.26 --> 3330.62]  I mean, I can't say that's been a thing for me, but I I think in terms of generalizations. That's probably a truer a truer trend
[3330.62 --> 3335.66]  I know a lot of people that do but like let's look at the way that the landscape has changed in terms of the workplace
[3335.66 --> 3343.74]  I mean boomers enjoyed by far the best worker protections of any generation as far as I can tell we went from
[3344.38 --> 3344.94]  uh
[3344.94 --> 3348.22]  essentially, you know a free-for-all right like
[3349.26 --> 3358.30]  Realistically there were there were there were two enormous global conflicts in the in the 20 years leading up to like 25 years leading up to the baby boomer generation
[3358.62 --> 3363.82]  Scarcity was was a huge thing and you basically did whatever it took
[3364.38 --> 3367.26]  um forget forget about you know protections there was you know
[3367.26 --> 3369.18]  There's also the great recession. Yeah, well, yeah
[3369.18 --> 3372.38]  Well, when did the uh when did the new deal when did the new deal kick in?
[3372.38 --> 3376.78]  What was that? Roosevelt? I can't remember so we're talking about this from a north american perspective obviously, right?
[3377.26 --> 3377.66]  um
[3379.02 --> 3385.02]  But you look at the at the at the trend towards like union employment in north america
[3385.66 --> 3391.90]  And then away from it as we're going into now just about the least union thing ever which is would be the gig economy
[3391.90 --> 3395.74]  And gig economy has been sold as a positive thing, but I
[3396.38 --> 3398.78]  I patently reject it. I mean we had
[3399.98 --> 3406.46]  We had a lot of conversations early on about whether linus media group would take on contractors for example
[3406.46 --> 3411.50]  Which is quite common in the in the production industry you you would you just hire contractors for
[3412.06 --> 3414.46]  Your projects and then at the end of the project
[3414.46 --> 3420.46]  You cut everyone loose and then you bring on a new set of contractors some repeating some new
[3420.86 --> 3424.70]  For whatever your next project is and I was like well, no, we're never going to be structured that way
[3425.42 --> 3429.02]  We just need to make sure that our pipeline is consistent enough
[3429.58 --> 3433.50]  That when we hire people yeah, when we hire people we bring them on full-time
[3434.06 --> 3436.86]  And they have the the benefits of being employees
[3436.86 --> 3443.02]  But I would say that for many millennials. It's probably not a choice to be a job hopper
[3444.30 --> 3447.34]  Like if you don't have if you don't have the protections
[3448.06 --> 3448.86]  um
[3448.86 --> 3455.26]  And my brother used to drive truck for the so yeah in vancouver. There's like some people refer to it as hollywood north
[3455.42 --> 3459.34]  There's a lot of film done in vancouver and my brother used to drive
[3460.14 --> 3464.94]  He was a teamster. So you drive trucks. He would do you do whatever for for the movies and uh
[3464.94 --> 3470.54]  Yeah, he did very well for himself. He did a really good job. So it was fine, but uh
[3471.50 --> 3474.22]  It was a contract position. There was a union
[3474.78 --> 3481.58]  But he was still a contractor under the union. So he'd work a movie or a show and then it would end and then see you later
[3482.22 --> 3485.74]  Maybe he'd have another job lined up. Maybe not. Yeah, who knows?
[3487.02 --> 3491.98]  Again, he did well so people would request him so he did fine, but like
[3491.98 --> 3495.34]  It's a little sketchy, you know
[3497.26 --> 3502.38]  So yeah, I mean I think yeah, you could probably make that generalization, but it's also I don't think it was a choice
[3502.38 --> 3507.42]  I think if we could just be lifers at one company and have that actually work out fine
[3507.74 --> 3511.26]  Yeah, then that would be great. There's also been a trend of
[3512.62 --> 3514.62]  Yeah, needing to hop for
[3514.86 --> 3516.86]  for like
[3516.94 --> 3521.82]  Compensation increases livable income. Yeah, because yeah, because you look at the way especially at the very
[3521.98 --> 3523.98]  Low end the way that
[3524.30 --> 3529.82]  Compensation has scaled relative to living costs. Yeah, it's ridiculous. You got a hop trying to grab that it's also
[3530.06 --> 3532.62]  Jaden pointed this out and I think it's gonna be off my screen
[3532.62 --> 3536.70]  So I don't think I'm gonna be able to quote it perfectly. I'm sorry. Um, oh, no, it is
[3537.02 --> 3542.14]  He said this is the age of the side gig. So we went from one person being able to generate
[3543.74 --> 3546.62]  Comfortably healthy enough income for a family of four. Yeah
[3546.62 --> 3548.62]  To two people
[3549.18 --> 3554.62]  Needing each of them having full-time jobs and side gigs to barely scrape by like it
[3556.14 --> 3559.02]  And then there's the next generalization our sense of entitlement
[3560.06 --> 3566.06]  I mean, I think that feeling like you're owed something when you look at how things you know man
[3567.10 --> 3573.18]  How like impossible it is to buy real estate how impossible it is to own realistically anything every time it trends
[3573.18 --> 3575.18]  like
[3575.18 --> 3581.42]  Boomer senator or you know boomer, you know investment banker or whatever
[3582.46 --> 3584.22]  Guesses how much houses cost?
[3584.86 --> 3586.86]  Oh, yeah, and the values are like
[3587.50 --> 3592.78]  Groceries yeah, not not I mean groceries not so much because that's a question of inflation
[3593.18 --> 3596.22]  Whereas housing costs are not a function of inflation
[3596.78 --> 3600.30]  The reason why I brought up the groceries one is yeah, you'll sometimes hear
[3600.30 --> 3602.78]  Uh, the question asked of what cost of living is
[3603.34 --> 3607.66]  So they'll say like oh, you probably have to spend this much on your on your rent this much on your food
[3607.66 --> 3613.10]  Whatever and the food number is always like bro. I would feed an average person for like a week not a month
[3613.42 --> 3614.30]  like
[3614.30 --> 3615.42]  I have been
[3615.42 --> 3617.42]  I I am in a very
[3617.42 --> 3618.14]  um
[3618.14 --> 3620.46]  I said I sorry I sent linus a picture
[3621.10 --> 3625.10]  I don't even think it was that long ago. Yeah, because I was buying this like package of chicken surprise surprise
[3625.10 --> 3630.30]  Um, and it's the exact same package of chicken from the exact same store
[3630.78 --> 3632.62]  That i've been buying it from forever
[3633.34 --> 3638.46]  It's and I I don't remember the year gap, but I think it was like five or six years something like that
[3639.10 --> 3643.26]  And it was exactly double the price. I that's crazy
[3643.50 --> 3648.70]  I am in a very privileged position where I don't have to think too much about the cost of groceries
[3648.70 --> 3656.30]  And so for many years, I didn't look that closely because I you know, especially before we had a bigger family. It just
[3657.26 --> 3659.74]  Wasn't that big of a deal as long as we weren't eating out too much
[3660.62 --> 3663.58]  It was fine. It didn't really have to think about it. Right. Yeah
[3664.62 --> 3666.78]  Even I am noticing
[3668.06 --> 3673.42]  It's it's it's it's it's just it's mind-blowing. I saw a little I saw a little pack of raspberries
[3673.42 --> 3681.10]  Yeah, they're out of season sure I saw a little pack of raspberries about this big by this tall not even the deep one
[3681.34 --> 3687.18]  Okay, pack of raspberries. Yeah, the shallow like tray. It was over ten dollars at nester's market
[3688.46 --> 3689.58]  Ten
[3689.82 --> 3690.46]  dollars
[3690.46 --> 3698.62]  Yeah, it was like 250 grams of raspberries. I left save on with three grocery bags and it was like a hundred and sixty bucks
[3699.58 --> 3701.58]  I was just
[3701.58 --> 3706.14]  Like oh man, and like yeah, they were fairly stacked full whatever whatever but like
[3707.18 --> 3708.22]  Damn, I don't know
[3708.94 --> 3711.42]  The commodification of real estate does need to end
[3712.06 --> 3712.94]  um
[3712.94 --> 3716.30]  And then the last stereotype millennials are praise hungry
[3718.86 --> 3719.34]  I mean
[3720.94 --> 3722.06]  Doesn't hurt
[3722.06 --> 3725.50]  Yeah, all right. You know what? I'm okay. I'm okay with being a millennial. Yeah
[3726.38 --> 3727.74]  Give me my avocado toast
[3727.74 --> 3732.46]  It's actually pretty good. I know I never like gotta get tuna and cheese too though
[3732.46 --> 3736.30]  I like tuna and cheese on my avocado toast my uh my partner made some for me
[3736.30 --> 3740.62]  And she had like red onions on it along with the avocado and like all this other stuff
[3740.62 --> 3745.50]  Sounds expensive and I was I was pretty sold. It was actually like probably pretty expensive. Yeah. Yeah
[3746.14 --> 3748.14]  Man, we went out for dinner
[3748.14 --> 3750.14]  It was really expensive
[3750.78 --> 3754.30]  Okay, I have biggest problem was it wasn't that good like look i've got kids
[3754.54 --> 3758.22]  Okay, I don't really I don't really go out anywhere other than
[3758.78 --> 3763.26]  You know stuff some food in your face and feed your brood kind of places. You know what I mean?
[3763.26 --> 3765.34]  So we'll yeah, we'll hit the IHOP or whatever
[3765.50 --> 3769.18]  Yeah, but we went to kind of a like a mid-scale
[3769.18 --> 3775.74]  place like a little bit nicer than IHOP but not like uh, you know, gotham steakhouse or whatever
[3775.74 --> 3778.86]  You know like just not too crazy like but it's like a nice enough
[3779.02 --> 3781.82]  Yeah, and still it's like a chain or whatever though
[3782.54 --> 3786.06]  And like what was my entree like 26 dollars or something like that?
[3786.06 --> 3787.50]  Yeah
[3787.50 --> 3793.74]  And it wasn't even big. No. It was pasta. Yeah, it was pasta. It's practically free
[3793.74 --> 3799.26]  Just fill the f***ing plate. It's like cheaping out on the rice
[3802.78 --> 3805.90]  Yeah, mine was really expensive too. It was like I don't know
[3806.46 --> 3812.46]  I would in that case. I would have been more happy if I thought it was the better, but it really wasn't that amazing
[3814.86 --> 3817.82]  Yeah, I mean we were talking about it while we were there too
[3818.06 --> 3823.58]  And it feels like the relative cost of groceries versus restaurants. I feel like groceries has gone up sharper than restaurants
[3823.74 --> 3829.26]  Have I don't know like if I compared I just haven't eaten out enough so it's hard for me to know
[3829.98 --> 3834.38]  Well, because I was thinking about when we went to dinner when I was at the grocery store
[3834.62 --> 3837.90]  And I was comparing some of the costs of the things that would have been included in my meal
[3838.70 --> 3843.42]  And I'm like yeah, that was really expensive. Also, they didn't really make a ton
[3844.38 --> 3849.02]  Considering someone had to cook all this and it had to be served and we took up space and an establishment all this kind of stuff
[3849.02 --> 3852.94]  Yeah, there's not that many people in here. So, you know rent has gone
[3853.66 --> 3860.06]  Yep, so like all these different factors. I was like wow, I really they they didn't hose me here like yeah
[3860.94 --> 3864.22]  It just is really expensive. Yeah, I don't know
[3865.98 --> 3867.98]  What do we want to talk about next?
[3868.62 --> 3870.62]  Olympics of esports
[3870.62 --> 3875.26]  Yeah, we did that phone with the game on it ever make its way to us. Dan, did you get it?
[3876.06 --> 3878.06]  No, oh
[3878.06 --> 3881.98]  Wanshowrider asked there it was said there was a phone if wait, are you still here?
[3882.54 --> 3886.94]  Oh, do you do you hang out during when show now, too, but you just you hide over there? Oh, okay
[3887.34 --> 3891.74]  Uh, we'll introduce when show writer once uh the probation period is over, but
[3892.70 --> 3898.22]  Assuming everything goes according to plan, but I think it's time for us to talk about the olympics of esports
[3899.42 --> 3904.86]  Not only that the olympics is getting esports the olympics has declared their first ever competitive
[3904.86 --> 3908.30]  Esports competition and honestly when I saw that title
[3908.86 --> 3913.66]  I was actually a little excited because I was like, you know what it's taking them this long
[3913.66 --> 3919.42]  Except that the olympics is a horrible horrible organization or the the ioc or whatever
[3919.98 --> 3926.78]  Is a horrible organization and you should have known immediately as soon as they were involved that it was going to be terrible
[3927.18 --> 3929.18]  This is on you
[3929.58 --> 3934.86]  My naivete assumed that they were going to do some like really informed things with this
[3935.26 --> 3935.98]  um
[3935.98 --> 3937.98]  They freaking didn't
[3937.98 --> 3938.78]  At all
[3939.34 --> 3944.62]  The list of games to be included in this competition lacks things that you might expect
[3944.62 --> 3948.14]  Like counter-strike or dota or legal eds or rocket league my initial reaction
[3948.14 --> 3949.34]  Wait, they don't have rocket league?
[3949.74 --> 3949.98]  No
[3950.54 --> 3953.10]  Well, why would they what they don't have dota or league of legends?
[3953.10 --> 3953.66]  No
[3953.66 --> 3955.26]  I have actually not looked into this
[3955.26 --> 3956.06]  Oh, no
[3956.06 --> 3956.46]  Wait
[3957.02 --> 3959.42]  So they don't have actual competitive esports?
[3959.42 --> 3962.22]  It's so insanely worse than you could possibly imagine
[3962.22 --> 3962.94]  Okay, because I
[3963.66 --> 3966.46]  Assumed it would be terrible and therefore didn't look into it
[3966.46 --> 3967.26]  It's so much worse
[3967.26 --> 3968.70]  So you actually know more about this than I do
[3968.70 --> 3968.86]  Yeah
[3969.58 --> 3972.46]  My initial because the way that I've always thought they would do this
[3972.70 --> 3976.54]  Is they would include things that are not necessarily that relevant anymore
[3976.54 --> 3977.26]  Like maybe
[3978.46 --> 3978.94]  Wait
[3978.94 --> 3979.42]  Hold on
[3980.38 --> 3980.62]  Wait
[3980.62 --> 3981.50]  Hold on, we'll get there
[3981.98 --> 3982.54]  Hold on
[3982.54 --> 3983.82]  No, I can't
[3983.82 --> 3985.82]  Now you understand why this is a main topic
[3985.82 --> 3986.30]  Wait
[3986.30 --> 3986.86]  Yeah
[3986.86 --> 3987.50]  No
[3987.50 --> 3987.98]  Yeah
[3987.98 --> 3988.46]  No
[3988.46 --> 3988.94]  Yeah
[3988.94 --> 3989.50]  No
[3989.50 --> 3991.18]  Okay, we'll skip my anecdotes
[3991.18 --> 3992.14]  We'll go right into it
[3992.14 --> 3992.70]  No, no
[3992.70 --> 3993.42]  No, do your anecdotes
[3993.42 --> 3994.38]  I need to recover
[3994.38 --> 3994.70]  Okay
[3995.90 --> 3999.82]  So I have always imagined that they would do this in a kind of weird way
[3999.82 --> 4002.06]  They would pick games that aren't necessarily super popular anymore
[4002.06 --> 4003.66]  Because if you pick dota or league
[4003.66 --> 4004.38]  Starcraft 2
[4004.38 --> 4005.98]  They're going to rebalance it, right?
[4005.98 --> 4006.30]  Sure
[4006.30 --> 4007.82]  And it's going to be a problem
[4007.82 --> 4010.22]  So pick like Starcraft 1
[4010.78 --> 4011.42]  Oh, I see
[4011.42 --> 4012.94]  They're not patching that game anymore
[4012.94 --> 4013.66]  It's fixed
[4014.30 --> 4014.86]  Sure
[4014.86 --> 4015.34]  Right
[4015.34 --> 4017.26]  And there's a lot of skill involved
[4017.26 --> 4018.86]  Very specific skill involved
[4018.86 --> 4019.98]  That you could kind of measure
[4019.98 --> 4021.42]  And people could actually be better at each other
[4021.42 --> 4021.98]  Maybe like
[4022.70 --> 4023.26]  I don't know
[4023.26 --> 4024.22]  Maybe not CSGO
[4024.22 --> 4024.86]  Or like a quake
[4024.86 --> 4026.06]  Because CSGO is currently under development
[4026.06 --> 4028.06]  You know, like a pure skill shooter
[4028.06 --> 4028.86]  Or something like that
[4028.86 --> 4028.94]  Yeah, maybe
[4028.94 --> 4031.18]  And like there's problems with that
[4031.18 --> 4031.90]  Oh my goodness
[4031.90 --> 4033.66]  1v1 me quake 3
[4033.66 --> 4034.22]  Let's go
[4034.22 --> 4036.46]  Yeah, so like it would be interesting
[4036.46 --> 4038.22]  That's maybe a way to approach it
[4038.22 --> 4038.54]  Right?
[4038.86 --> 4041.50]  Maybe they do go with the current generation stuff
[4041.50 --> 4042.70]  But then it becomes an issue
[4042.70 --> 4043.66]  Which one do you pick?
[4043.66 --> 4044.46]  Dota or league?
[4044.46 --> 4046.22]  There's going to be a massive war about that
[4046.22 --> 4049.66]  And how do you balance this idea that people are actively like
[4049.66 --> 4051.50]  It just becomes weird commercially
[4051.50 --> 4053.10]  What they decided to do
[4053.10 --> 4057.10]  Was the absolute worst possible option
[4057.10 --> 4061.10]  Out of everything that you could have possibly imagined
[4061.66 --> 4064.30]  I don't think that anyone could have guessed this
[4064.30 --> 4067.02]  What the f*** is Tic Tac Bow?
[4067.66 --> 4070.54]  Well, it makes sense that you've never heard of it
[4070.54 --> 4071.10]  Because
[4071.10 --> 4073.90]  Is there a list of all the things that they picked?
[4074.30 --> 4074.54]  So
[4075.42 --> 4076.30]  There is somewhere
[4076.30 --> 4076.62]  Yeah
[4076.62 --> 4080.78]  Dan, do you wanna jump on the Luke camera here maybe?
[4080.78 --> 4083.10]  And I can play some Tic Tac Bow for the people?
[4083.10 --> 4083.34]  While
[4084.06 --> 4085.26]  While we get this going?
[4085.26 --> 4086.30]  I wanna see the
[4086.78 --> 4089.10]  Olympics eSports page really quickly
[4090.14 --> 4091.34]  Enter the arena
[4091.34 --> 4092.06]  Yeah, here we go
[4093.90 --> 4094.86]  Olympic eSports
[4095.66 --> 4096.30]  Arena mode
[4096.30 --> 4097.58]  Okay, I'm joining arena mode
[4097.58 --> 4099.42]  What the devil phone is this?
[4099.42 --> 4100.06]  My goodness
[4100.06 --> 4101.10]  It's an absolute brick
[4101.10 --> 4102.14]  Okay, doesn't matter
[4102.14 --> 4102.86]  Twitter post
[4102.86 --> 4105.10]  I just wanna see the list of the categories
[4105.10 --> 4105.98]  So I pay
[4105.98 --> 4108.62]  I pay to enter the arena
[4109.34 --> 4111.74]  But then I can win a prize
[4111.74 --> 4113.02]  If I win it's plus 20
[4113.02 --> 4114.22]  If I lose it's minus 8
[4115.02 --> 4115.66]  Oh my god
[4115.66 --> 4118.14]  My slots for loot crates are currently full
[4118.14 --> 4120.78]  And you will not be able to earn new crates
[4120.78 --> 4122.38]  You can still earn trophies and gold
[4122.38 --> 4123.02]  Oh my god
[4123.90 --> 4124.30]  Okay
[4126.30 --> 4127.90]  Arena 2, Lion City
[4127.90 --> 4129.10]  Searching for opponents
[4130.62 --> 4130.94]  Alright
[4131.58 --> 4134.22]  I have strong wind resistance stats here
[4134.22 --> 4136.94]  Dan, are you having a hard time finding the focus button over there?
[4136.94 --> 4138.54]  It's locked on
[4139.10 --> 4139.66]  It's locked?
[4139.66 --> 4140.14]  Focus
[4140.14 --> 4141.74]  So I just put it in the area
[4141.74 --> 4142.38]  Okay, cool
[4142.38 --> 4143.34]  Thanks, Dan
[4143.90 --> 4145.34]  Okay, it is my turn
[4145.82 --> 4146.46]  What do I do?
[4146.46 --> 4147.58]  Oh my goodness
[4147.58 --> 4148.38]  What did I just do?
[4148.38 --> 4149.58]  I don't even know what just happened
[4150.78 --> 4151.90]  I don't know how to play this
[4151.90 --> 4152.94]  Oi, oi, oi, oi
[4152.94 --> 4153.82]  What the?
[4153.82 --> 4155.18]  Oh, what the crap?
[4157.42 --> 4159.34]  So I'm almost out of time or something?
[4159.34 --> 4159.82]  Or like
[4159.82 --> 4160.70]  Do I let go?
[4160.70 --> 4160.94]  Or
[4160.94 --> 4162.22]  Hey!
[4162.22 --> 4164.54]  You got the top middle one
[4165.26 --> 4165.82]  Okay
[4165.82 --> 4171.74]  Time for the other player to play this tic-tac-toe game that is apparently in the Olympics
[4171.74 --> 4173.82]  What? It just goes exactly where you say
[4175.26 --> 4176.22]  What the crap?
[4177.50 --> 4178.70]  Uh, okay
[4181.74 --> 4182.30]  So you just
[4183.58 --> 4184.22]  Yeah, it just
[4184.22 --> 4186.06]  It doesn't even drop off
[4187.42 --> 4189.50]  What the heck is the point of this?
[4189.50 --> 4193.50]  Amazing
[4193.50 --> 4196.54]  I mean, I've played tic-tac-toe games at like
[4197.42 --> 4199.82]  Castle Fun Park that are kind of like this
[4199.82 --> 4201.98]  Like have you ever played like basketball tic-tac-toe?
[4202.54 --> 4203.02]  No
[4203.02 --> 4204.06]  So you have to sink a basket
[4204.06 --> 4204.70]  I can imagine
[4204.70 --> 4205.98]  To hit the thing
[4205.98 --> 4206.54]  I can imagine what it is
[4206.54 --> 4206.70]  Right?
[4208.86 --> 4209.10]  Um
[4209.10 --> 4211.18]  Apparently there's a little bit of drop off
[4211.18 --> 4212.06]  There's a little bit of drop off
[4212.06 --> 4215.66]  There's not much because I am nailing this even though I've never touched this game before
[4215.66 --> 4217.18]  Well, maybe you're just an Olympian
[4217.18 --> 4217.66]  Oh, okay
[4217.66 --> 4218.22]  Have you thought about that?
[4218.22 --> 4221.26]  So you can convert someone else's thing to your thing
[4221.26 --> 4221.82]  Okay
[4221.82 --> 4222.14]  Okay
[4223.50 --> 4225.18]  So that's neat
[4225.18 --> 4228.22]  But then I guess I just need to do this
[4229.02 --> 4230.54]  Oh, oh, hello buddy
[4231.02 --> 4231.34]  Okay
[4232.62 --> 4232.94]  So
[4234.78 --> 4236.78]  But then they still get to go
[4236.78 --> 4237.18]  Oh
[4237.18 --> 4237.90]  No, I won
[4237.90 --> 4238.30]  No
[4238.30 --> 4240.62]  Why on earth would they have shot that?
[4240.62 --> 4242.46]  Future Olympian Linus Sebastian
[4242.46 --> 4243.10]  Yeah
[4243.10 --> 4243.66]  Yeah
[4243.66 --> 4245.50]  Milk Fantasy was defeated
[4250.46 --> 4251.18]  Okay, so
[4251.18 --> 4252.22]  What a username
[4252.22 --> 4253.82]  So that's archery
[4253.82 --> 4256.06]  But there are more sports, right?
[4256.06 --> 4259.26]  The sports that they chose were archery
[4259.26 --> 4259.66]  No
[4259.66 --> 4260.22]  Baseball
[4260.22 --> 4260.78]  No
[4260.78 --> 4261.26]  Chess
[4261.90 --> 4262.78]  No
[4262.78 --> 4263.34]  Cycling
[4263.34 --> 4263.98]  Okay, chess, sure
[4263.98 --> 4264.38]  Fine
[4264.38 --> 4264.54]  Fine
[4264.54 --> 4266.06]  Cycling which is one of my favorite ones
[4266.06 --> 4267.82]  We'll get into that in a moment
[4267.82 --> 4268.22]  Dance
[4268.94 --> 4269.90]  Motorsport
[4270.86 --> 4271.34]  Sailing
[4271.98 --> 4273.66]  And Taekwondo
[4273.66 --> 4274.22]  And tennis
[4276.06 --> 4277.90]  All of these are represented
[4278.78 --> 4281.66]  By video games as you would expect
[4282.30 --> 4283.18]  Some of them are
[4283.18 --> 4284.86]  Please tell me tennis is Wii Sports
[4285.58 --> 4287.18]  I honestly when I first read this
[4287.18 --> 4287.82]  Cause I'm ready
[4287.82 --> 4290.38]  I assumed it was all going to be Wii Sports
[4290.38 --> 4292.62]  Tennis is apparently Tennis Clash
[4292.62 --> 4295.10]  Taekwondo is a game called Virtual Taekwondo
[4295.10 --> 4298.14]  Sailing is a game called Virtual Regatta
[4298.86 --> 4299.26]  Okay
[4299.26 --> 4299.90]  I don't know
[4299.90 --> 4301.66]  Yeah, a regatta is a sailing competition
[4301.66 --> 4302.62]  Okay, makes sense
[4302.62 --> 4303.58]  Motorsport
[4303.58 --> 4304.54]  No, well
[4304.54 --> 4305.98]  It doesn't make that much sense
[4305.98 --> 4306.38]  It's like
[4306.38 --> 4308.38]  It's like boating culture sense
[4308.94 --> 4310.06]  So it like doesn't make sense
[4310.06 --> 4310.30]  But
[4311.02 --> 4312.46]  These two line up best for me
[4312.46 --> 4313.34]  Out of all of them
[4313.34 --> 4313.66]  Yeah
[4313.66 --> 4313.98]  Or no
[4313.98 --> 4314.62]  That's not true
[4314.62 --> 4316.22]  One of them later on does a little bit more
[4316.22 --> 4318.22]  Motorsport is just Gran Turismo
[4319.02 --> 4319.42]  Sure
[4319.42 --> 4319.98]  It's like okay
[4319.98 --> 4321.34]  Dance is just dance
[4321.34 --> 4322.30]  Like
[4322.30 --> 4323.18]  Okay
[4323.18 --> 4323.90]  Okay
[4323.90 --> 4324.94]  Cycling is Swift
[4324.94 --> 4327.58]  We'll get into why that's interesting in a second
[4327.58 --> 4329.42]  Chess is just chess.com
[4329.42 --> 4329.74]  Okay
[4329.74 --> 4330.78]  Alright, let's go
[4330.78 --> 4331.18]  Okay
[4331.18 --> 4332.14]  Okay, games
[4332.14 --> 4332.46]  Except
[4332.46 --> 4335.26]  No, how could they screw that up?
[4335.26 --> 4335.82]  Except
[4335.82 --> 4336.38]  No
[4336.38 --> 4337.10]  Hold on
[4337.10 --> 4338.46]  And I
[4338.46 --> 4340.46]  Before people get into the battle
[4340.46 --> 4341.50]  Between chess apps
[4341.50 --> 4343.66]  I like and use both of them
[4343.66 --> 4343.94]  Okay
[4343.94 --> 4344.72]  So relax
[4344.72 --> 4345.54]  But
[4345.54 --> 4347.38]  Chess.com is the more
[4347.38 --> 4348.66]  Corporate friendly
[4348.66 --> 4351.18]  Lots of paid options version
[4351.18 --> 4353.86]  Lee Chess is the free for everyone all the time
[4353.86 --> 4354.72]  Everything is free
[4354.72 --> 4356.48]  Doesn't ask you to pay for anything
[4356.48 --> 4357.06]  Sure
[4357.06 --> 4359.28]  But at least it's a valid
[4359.28 --> 4361.66]  Measure of your chess skill
[4361.66 --> 4362.16]  Totally
[4362.16 --> 4363.94]  Like that's where I'm coming at it from
[4363.94 --> 4364.44]  Because
[4364.44 --> 4365.50]  And chess.com is huge
[4365.50 --> 4367.32]  That is not f***ing archery
[4367.32 --> 4368.56]  And chess.com is legit
[4368.56 --> 4370.42]  And there's no pay to win on chess
[4370.42 --> 4370.66]  Yeah
[4370.66 --> 4371.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[4371.40 --> 4372.56]  That's all fine
[4372.56 --> 4373.68]  No major problem there
[4373.68 --> 4377.40]  Baseball is WBSCE Baseball Power Pro
[4377.40 --> 4377.90]  Sorry
[4377.90 --> 4379.28]  I will say it properly
[4379.28 --> 4382.14]  WBSCE Baseball TM
[4382.14 --> 4383.16]  Power Pros
[4383.16 --> 4385.54]  And archery as we've already seen
[4385.54 --> 4386.82]  I've never heard of any of this crap
[4386.82 --> 4387.50]  Is Tic Tac Bow
[4387.50 --> 4389.74]  Well the reason why you haven't heard of Tic Tac Bow
[4389.74 --> 4391.70]  Is because it was literally just released
[4391.70 --> 4394.88]  It had
[4394.88 --> 4395.80]  When I looked at it
[4395.80 --> 4397.58]  It had 100 downloads
[4397.58 --> 4399.54]  On the Android Play Store
[4399.54 --> 4400.94]  And is not on iOS
[4400.94 --> 4403.20]  So it's not a game that people have really played before
[4403.20 --> 4405.18]  Well I guess it's a level playing field then
[4405.18 --> 4406.42]  It also has
[4406.42 --> 4408.84]  For now until they microtransaction the crap out of you
[4408.84 --> 4410.30]  So it also has some issues
[4410.30 --> 4411.94]  Because there's microtransactions
[4411.94 --> 4415.06]  That apparently can actually give a competitive advantage
[4415.06 --> 4415.90]  Oh good
[4415.90 --> 4418.22]  Rough
[4418.22 --> 4422.30]  So Olympics just becomes even more pay to win than it already was
[4422.30 --> 4424.28]  It also looks like Tennis Clash
[4424.28 --> 4426.52]  At least the previous pay to win
[4426.52 --> 4428.66]  Was like which countries have the best
[4428.66 --> 4429.10]  You know
[4429.10 --> 4430.58]  Money to pay coaches
[4430.58 --> 4432.08]  And money to pay athletes
[4432.08 --> 4433.08]  To just be athletes
[4433.08 --> 4434.00]  Or to buy equipment
[4434.00 --> 4434.84]  Like special shoes
[4434.84 --> 4435.38]  Yeah exactly
[4435.38 --> 4437.28]  So now it's just
[4437.28 --> 4439.34]  No you actually just dump money
[4439.34 --> 4442.26]  Into a mobile game studios account
[4442.26 --> 4443.84]  And then you're an Olympian
[4443.84 --> 4444.84]  One of the ones
[4444.84 --> 4446.32]  So chess I think is interesting
[4446.32 --> 4447.32]  I think it's very interesting
[4447.32 --> 4448.70]  That chess is in the Olympics now
[4448.70 --> 4450.18]  But that's kind of
[4450.18 --> 4452.02]  I feel like chess out of all of these
[4452.02 --> 4453.52]  It's in its own little area
[4453.52 --> 4454.80]  Yeah
[4454.80 --> 4456.28]  There's no pay to win
[4456.28 --> 4457.40]  Yeah chess is fine
[4457.40 --> 4461.10]  I don't know that we needed Olympic chess
[4461.10 --> 4462.08]  I think it could have been
[4462.08 --> 4464.46]  I think chess could just do their own championship
[4464.46 --> 4465.46]  Which they kind of do
[4465.46 --> 4465.84]  It kind of has its own thing already
[4465.84 --> 4467.24]  Which is totally fine
[4467.24 --> 4467.60]  Yeah
[4467.60 --> 4470.08]  But if the Olympics raises the profile of chess
[4470.08 --> 4471.32]  I think that's super cool
[4471.32 --> 4471.58]  Yeah
[4471.58 --> 4474.30]  Chess is kind of its own thing in this in my opinion
[4474.30 --> 4475.64]  But I could almost see it being
[4475.64 --> 4477.48]  Like a completely separate event
[4477.48 --> 4479.16]  Like why have just chess
[4479.16 --> 4479.88]  Why
[4479.88 --> 4480.66]  It would be kind of interesting
[4480.66 --> 4482.18]  If they promoted like a different form of it
[4482.18 --> 4482.76]  Like blitz
[4482.76 --> 4483.42]  Yeah well I mean
[4483.42 --> 4484.76]  You've already got the
[4484.76 --> 4485.72]  You've already got the Olympics
[4485.72 --> 4486.98]  You've already got the Paralympics
[4486.98 --> 4489.50]  Why don't you just have like the board game Olympics then
[4489.50 --> 4490.22]  At that point right
[4490.22 --> 4491.64]  Like do it during the same period
[4491.64 --> 4492.74]  Make it part of the event
[4492.74 --> 4494.38]  Like it doesn't have
[4494.38 --> 4495.70]  It doesn't have to be
[4495.70 --> 4496.98]  The Olympics
[4496.98 --> 4498.10]  Yeah fair enough
[4498.10 --> 4500.30]  To be an IOC
[4500.30 --> 4501.44]  You know event
[4501.44 --> 4501.90]  Like mind
[4501.90 --> 4502.62]  Yeah you could
[4502.62 --> 4503.56]  You could have like go
[4503.56 --> 4504.54]  And chess
[4504.54 --> 4505.26]  Sure why not
[4505.26 --> 4505.62]  And a bunch of these
[4505.62 --> 4506.70]  Yeah that would be really interesting
[4506.70 --> 4507.46]  Mahjong
[4507.46 --> 4508.36]  Poker
[4508.36 --> 4509.12]  Like I don't care
[4509.12 --> 4510.22]  Yeah screw it
[4510.22 --> 4511.72]  Cycling
[4511.72 --> 4514.00]  I don't know a ton about Zwift
[4514.00 --> 4516.04]  But I just find this very funny
[4516.04 --> 4517.42]  I'm fairly certain
[4517.42 --> 4518.32]  That Zwift
[4518.32 --> 4519.30]  Is just like
[4519.30 --> 4521.58]  A stationary bike racing game
[4521.58 --> 4524.10]  So I'm pretty sure
[4524.10 --> 4525.96]  The esport of cycling
[4525.96 --> 4527.56]  Is just gonna be cycling
[4527.56 --> 4528.64]  Is just cycling
[4528.64 --> 4531.62]  Indoors in a stationary position
[4531.62 --> 4532.52]  Yeah
[4532.52 --> 4533.58]  It's just
[4533.58 --> 4537.08]  Which like
[4537.08 --> 4537.56]  That's
[4537.56 --> 4538.76]  That's great
[4538.76 --> 4540.40]  If you get your cardio
[4540.40 --> 4540.84]  By
[4540.84 --> 4542.08]  Chilling at home
[4542.08 --> 4542.48]  On a
[4542.48 --> 4543.18]  On a bike
[4543.18 --> 4544.06]  Ripping through
[4544.06 --> 4544.56]  Whatever
[4544.56 --> 4545.72]  Fine
[4545.72 --> 4548.02]  Maybe you're sketched out
[4548.02 --> 4548.34]  About
[4548.34 --> 4550.16]  Like biking around
[4550.16 --> 4550.70]  In the rain
[4550.70 --> 4551.36]  If you live somewhere
[4551.36 --> 4552.14]  That's really rainy
[4552.14 --> 4552.82]  Or whatever else
[4552.82 --> 4553.60]  Because you don't want to like
[4553.60 --> 4554.92]  Fall
[4554.92 --> 4555.96]  Like I don't know
[4555.96 --> 4556.32]  Whatever
[4556.32 --> 4556.92]  Sounds good
[4556.92 --> 4558.02]  But
[4558.02 --> 4559.12]  Did we need
[4559.12 --> 4561.58]  Cycling but stationary
[4561.58 --> 4562.70]  As an
[4562.70 --> 4564.48]  As an Olympic sport
[4564.48 --> 4565.66]  I don't know
[4565.66 --> 4568.12]  Doesn't seem like it to me
[4568.12 --> 4570.08]  Like there's
[4570.08 --> 4571.66]  I see different categories
[4571.66 --> 4572.28]  For this right
[4572.28 --> 4573.48]  So chess is in its own
[4573.48 --> 4574.32]  Kind of thing
[4574.32 --> 4575.70]  And I agree with what Linus said
[4575.70 --> 4576.54]  Maybe it could be there
[4576.54 --> 4577.60]  But if it's there
[4577.60 --> 4578.34]  I feel like we should have
[4578.34 --> 4579.36]  An assortment of those games
[4579.36 --> 4579.88]  Like Majong
[4579.88 --> 4580.20]  Go
[4580.20 --> 4581.18]  All this other kind of stuff
[4581.18 --> 4582.22]  Then there's
[4582.22 --> 4583.36]  There's archery
[4583.36 --> 4584.08]  And baseball
[4584.08 --> 4585.26]  And
[4585.26 --> 4586.20]  What is it
[4586.20 --> 4586.80]  Taekwondo
[4586.80 --> 4587.48]  Yeah
[4587.48 --> 4587.80]  And
[4587.80 --> 4588.74]  Or not necessarily
[4588.74 --> 4589.04]  Taekwondo
[4589.04 --> 4589.84]  Archery
[4589.84 --> 4590.30]  Baseball
[4590.30 --> 4590.84]  And tennis
[4590.84 --> 4592.02]  Where they're just like
[4592.02 --> 4593.98]  These microtransaction
[4593.98 --> 4594.88]  Ad based
[4594.88 --> 4596.08]  Pay to win games
[4596.08 --> 4596.76]  Which are like
[4596.76 --> 4597.62]  Clearly
[4597.62 --> 4598.34]  Junk
[4598.34 --> 4599.04]  Like why is
[4599.04 --> 4599.98]  Why is this a thing
[4599.98 --> 4601.52]  And then there's the two
[4601.52 --> 4602.20]  What do you mean junk
[4602.20 --> 4602.92]  I won
[4602.92 --> 4604.08]  That archery match
[4604.08 --> 4604.90]  I apologize
[4604.90 --> 4605.94]  Future Olympian
[4605.94 --> 4606.66]  Linus Sebastian
[4606.66 --> 4608.34]  Then there's the two
[4608.34 --> 4609.04]  Like these are
[4609.04 --> 4610.52]  Major title video games
[4610.52 --> 4610.86]  Games
[4610.86 --> 4611.24]  Yeah
[4611.24 --> 4612.18]  Which is Gran Turismo
[4612.18 --> 4613.04]  For motorsports
[4613.04 --> 4613.36]  Okay
[4613.36 --> 4614.28]  And Just Dance
[4614.28 --> 4614.86]  For Dance
[4614.86 --> 4615.98]  Which is like
[4615.98 --> 4616.80]  Okay that's
[4616.80 --> 4617.76]  Interesting
[4617.76 --> 4618.74]  I mean if you're gonna go
[4618.74 --> 4620.04]  If you're gonna go full meme
[4620.04 --> 4621.78]  Like make it DDR then
[4621.78 --> 4622.72]  Let's go
[4622.72 --> 4624.58]  Honestly yeah
[4624.58 --> 4625.74]  In my opinion
[4625.74 --> 4627.24]  I have watched
[4627.24 --> 4628.60]  People play DDR
[4628.60 --> 4629.22]  Competitive DDR
[4629.22 --> 4630.38]  With fascination
[4630.38 --> 4630.96]  Pretty cool
[4630.96 --> 4631.90]  Because it's amazing
[4631.90 --> 4632.34]  Yeah
[4632.34 --> 4633.54]  Yeah I think
[4633.54 --> 4635.06]  Compared to Just Dance
[4635.06 --> 4636.38]  DDR would actually be
[4636.38 --> 4637.78]  A much more interesting
[4637.78 --> 4638.74]  Spectator experience
[4638.74 --> 4639.06]  Yeah
[4639.06 --> 4640.36]  Especially if it was like
[4640.36 --> 4641.24]  Almost like
[4641.24 --> 4642.84]  Gymnastics based
[4642.84 --> 4643.76]  You know how they have to
[4643.76 --> 4644.68]  Like pick what moves
[4644.68 --> 4645.74]  They're gonna try to do beforehand
[4645.74 --> 4647.12]  So in DDR
[4647.12 --> 4647.76]  You could be like
[4647.76 --> 4648.56]  Oh so it's down to the execution
[4648.56 --> 4649.36]  I'm gonna do
[4649.36 --> 4650.54]  Like a multi pad
[4650.54 --> 4652.04]  So I'm gonna like
[4652.04 --> 4653.48]  Dance across these two pads
[4653.48 --> 4654.42]  At the same time
[4654.42 --> 4654.68]  Yeah
[4654.68 --> 4655.38]  Like try different
[4655.38 --> 4656.28]  Difficulty rating
[4656.28 --> 4657.08]  And then you have like
[4657.08 --> 4657.34]  Kind of
[4657.34 --> 4658.26]  I think you could have
[4658.26 --> 4658.50]  Like a
[4658.50 --> 4658.86]  It could be cool
[4658.86 --> 4660.10]  A touch of subjectivity
[4660.10 --> 4661.28]  Like or not subjectivity
[4661.28 --> 4662.26]  But like you could have
[4662.26 --> 4663.18]  Kind of like what they do
[4663.18 --> 4663.82]  In figure skating
[4663.82 --> 4666.04]  Where there are points
[4666.04 --> 4667.40]  Assigned to the difficulty
[4667.40 --> 4668.06]  Of the routine
[4668.06 --> 4668.64]  Exactly yeah
[4668.64 --> 4669.84]  So if you have to switch
[4669.84 --> 4671.44]  Pads six times
[4671.44 --> 4672.72]  That has this modifier
[4672.72 --> 4673.14]  Or whatever
[4673.14 --> 4674.02]  Yeah you could totally
[4674.02 --> 4675.12]  Build a system for that
[4675.12 --> 4675.78]  That would be
[4675.78 --> 4676.90]  Kind of awesome
[4676.90 --> 4678.12]  There is a hundred percent
[4678.12 --> 4679.18]  A way that you could do
[4679.18 --> 4679.94]  Olympic dance
[4679.94 --> 4680.62]  That I would
[4680.62 --> 4682.62]  Olympic dance is an e-sport
[4682.62 --> 4683.26]  But just dance
[4683.26 --> 4684.22]  That I think would be interesting
[4684.22 --> 4685.44]  Come on
[4685.44 --> 4686.00]  Probably not
[4686.00 --> 4687.08]  I mean the tracking
[4687.08 --> 4688.56]  Is not even accurate enough
[4688.56 --> 4690.22]  At least with DDR
[4690.22 --> 4691.22]  There is
[4691.22 --> 4691.70]  There is
[4691.70 --> 4692.76]  There is a clear
[4692.76 --> 4695.84]  There's a precision to it
[4695.84 --> 4696.06]  Yeah
[4696.06 --> 4696.64]  You know
[4696.64 --> 4698.12]  There's a way to measure
[4698.12 --> 4699.06]  Objectively
[4699.06 --> 4701.58]  How close to the desired result
[4701.58 --> 4702.72]  The participant got
[4702.72 --> 4703.60]  You know
[4703.60 --> 4703.82]  Yeah
[4703.82 --> 4705.20]  I
[4705.20 --> 4705.54]  There
[4705.54 --> 4706.90]  There are people
[4706.90 --> 4708.08]  Who are
[4708.08 --> 4709.64]  At master level
[4709.64 --> 4710.56]  Of DDR
[4710.56 --> 4712.46]  That I don't care
[4712.46 --> 4713.94]  If you've never seen DDR before
[4713.94 --> 4714.80]  I don't care if you don't care
[4714.80 --> 4715.60]  About dancing games
[4715.60 --> 4716.26]  I don't care if you don't care
[4716.26 --> 4717.00]  About rhythm games
[4717.00 --> 4717.26]  Whatever
[4717.26 --> 4719.30]  It is genuinely fascinating
[4719.30 --> 4720.08]  To watch them
[4720.08 --> 4720.90]  Just like rip
[4720.90 --> 4722.40]  On like these
[4722.40 --> 4723.58]  Insanely high difficulty
[4723.58 --> 4724.82]  Songs
[4724.82 --> 4726.54]  Or in very difficult ways
[4726.54 --> 4727.32]  Or whatever else
[4727.32 --> 4728.26]  Yeah
[4728.26 --> 4729.18]  And they always do that thing
[4729.18 --> 4729.94]  Where they put their arms
[4729.94 --> 4730.98]  Behind them on the bar
[4730.98 --> 4735.12]  Like if I genuinely
[4735.12 --> 4735.90]  Try to do
[4735.90 --> 4736.82]  What this person
[4736.82 --> 4738.14]  Is probably gonna do
[4738.14 --> 4738.62]  Once we get into
[4738.62 --> 4739.28]  More difficult parts
[4739.28 --> 4740.78]  My legs are gonna twist up
[4740.78 --> 4741.54]  And I'm gonna fall over
[4741.54 --> 4742.58]  Like there's no
[4742.58 --> 4743.64]  I'm never gonna get this done
[4743.64 --> 4745.34]  I'm not
[4745.34 --> 4746.86]  I couldn't even touch
[4746.86 --> 4747.92]  Any of this already
[4747.92 --> 4748.52]  And you're telling me
[4748.52 --> 4749.46]  This is the easy part
[4749.46 --> 4750.70]  Oh are they doing
[4750.70 --> 4751.30]  Two pads
[4751.30 --> 4751.72]  Yeah
[4751.72 --> 4753.08]  Yeah like what the
[4753.08 --> 4754.10]  Buddy's on two pads
[4754.10 --> 4757.12]  Two pads let's go
[4757.12 --> 4758.76]  Like that's insane
[4758.76 --> 4761.90]  And then having like
[4761.90 --> 4763.16]  A competition of this
[4763.16 --> 4763.78]  Sure yeah I'm down
[4763.78 --> 4764.60]  Where people are trying
[4764.60 --> 4765.14]  More difficult
[4765.14 --> 4765.86]  More difficult things
[4765.86 --> 4766.34]  Like yeah
[4766.34 --> 4766.92]  Absolutely
[4766.92 --> 4769.50]  So yeah
[4769.50 --> 4770.34]  There's the
[4770.34 --> 4771.04]  The jank
[4771.04 --> 4771.86]  Pay to win games
[4771.86 --> 4773.02]  Then there's the like
[4773.02 --> 4774.44]  Major titles that
[4774.44 --> 4776.16]  I don't
[4776.16 --> 4776.92]  I also don't think
[4776.92 --> 4777.46]  Gran Turismo
[4777.46 --> 4778.58]  Should have been the racing one
[4778.58 --> 4779.44]  Gran Turismo doesn't need
[4779.44 --> 4780.00]  To be the one
[4780.00 --> 4781.14]  There are extremely
[4781.14 --> 4781.88]  High level
[4781.88 --> 4783.04]  Racing sim games
[4783.04 --> 4783.32]  Like sim
[4783.32 --> 4784.82]  Sim grade games
[4784.82 --> 4785.66]  I think Gran Turismo
[4785.66 --> 4787.04]  Is more sim like
[4787.04 --> 4787.68]  I get it
[4787.68 --> 4787.96]  Sure
[4787.96 --> 4789.02]  Than some of them
[4789.02 --> 4790.52]  But it's not as sim-y
[4790.52 --> 4791.28]  As something like
[4791.28 --> 4792.24]  A Project Cars
[4792.24 --> 4793.04]  Or something like
[4793.04 --> 4793.64]  So like
[4793.64 --> 4795.58]  It being Gran Turismo
[4795.58 --> 4796.32]  Makes me ask like
[4796.32 --> 4797.02]  What was the goal
[4797.02 --> 4797.94]  Because it's kind of
[4797.94 --> 4798.54]  Like F1
[4798.54 --> 4799.96]  It's almost in the
[4799.96 --> 4801.34]  Yes it's leaning more sim-y
[4801.34 --> 4802.18]  But it's in the middle
[4802.18 --> 4803.12]  It's not arcade-y
[4803.12 --> 4803.98]  And it's not sim-y
[4803.98 --> 4805.24]  Yeah
[4805.24 --> 4806.88]  Like you could have gone
[4806.88 --> 4808.34]  With like Mario Kart
[4808.34 --> 4810.48]  And just had it be like
[4810.48 --> 4811.56]  Totally arcade-y
[4811.56 --> 4811.84]  Oh iRacing
[4811.84 --> 4813.08]  Sorry not Project Cars
[4813.08 --> 4813.60]  iRacing
[4813.60 --> 4814.52]  That's the one I meant
[4814.52 --> 4815.00]  Yeah so
[4815.00 --> 4815.78]  Sorry I'm not
[4815.78 --> 4817.34]  I'm not into the racing game scene
[4817.34 --> 4818.68]  You could have gone iRacing
[4818.68 --> 4820.14]  You could have gone Mario Kart
[4820.14 --> 4821.20]  They went
[4821.20 --> 4822.12]  Not really in between
[4822.12 --> 4822.94]  Yeah I said of course
[4822.94 --> 4824.24]  But they went like here
[4824.24 --> 4825.80]  Like any one of those three
[4825.80 --> 4826.58]  F1
[4826.58 --> 4827.24]  iRacing
[4827.24 --> 4828.02]  Assetto Corsa
[4828.02 --> 4829.76]  Sure
[4829.76 --> 4830.58]  Sure
[4830.58 --> 4831.42]  I don't think I would have
[4831.42 --> 4832.52]  Blinked at any one of those
[4832.52 --> 4832.82]  Nope
[4832.82 --> 4833.24]  Yeah
[4833.24 --> 4835.00]  But Gran Turismo
[4835.00 --> 4835.88]  A little weird
[4835.88 --> 4836.98]  Like why don't you just
[4836.98 --> 4838.24]  Go Forza at that point
[4838.24 --> 4839.38]  Why don't you just
[4839.38 --> 4839.72]  You know what
[4839.72 --> 4840.26]  Why don't you do
[4840.26 --> 4841.38]  Just like Cruisin' USA
[4841.38 --> 4844.74]  I'd be way more interested
[4844.74 --> 4846.40]  To watch a Cruisin' USA
[4846.40 --> 4847.10]  Championship
[4847.10 --> 4847.94]  That'd be kind of sick
[4847.94 --> 4848.52]  Ridge Racer
[4848.52 --> 4849.30]  Yeah
[4849.30 --> 4851.42]  So and then
[4851.42 --> 4852.18]  There's cycling
[4852.18 --> 4852.84]  Where it's like
[4852.84 --> 4853.44]  Literally
[4853.44 --> 4855.92]  It's quite literally
[4855.92 --> 4856.76]  Just cycling
[4856.76 --> 4857.64]  It's this
[4857.64 --> 4858.16]  Like
[4858.16 --> 4860.28]  I hope the person
[4860.28 --> 4860.80]  Who wins
[4860.80 --> 4861.64]  Whatever equivalent
[4861.64 --> 4862.60]  Distance of race
[4862.60 --> 4863.40]  In actual
[4863.40 --> 4864.14]  Just real
[4864.14 --> 4865.54]  Actually on a bike
[4865.54 --> 4865.98]  Outside
[4865.98 --> 4866.64]  Whatever cycling
[4866.64 --> 4867.36]  Just gets two medals for it
[4867.36 --> 4868.26]  Just also wins
[4868.26 --> 4869.06]  The Zwift one
[4869.06 --> 4870.58]  I really hope that happens
[4870.58 --> 4871.72]  That'd be very funny
[4871.72 --> 4872.70]  Yeah smash
[4872.70 --> 4873.38]  Where's smash?
[4873.66 --> 4874.38]  Again this is
[4874.38 --> 4875.66]  No disrespect for people
[4875.66 --> 4876.88]  Who race Zwift
[4876.88 --> 4877.68]  And I know that there's people
[4877.68 --> 4878.32]  That do it actually
[4878.32 --> 4878.98]  Quite seriously
[4878.98 --> 4879.88]  That's cool
[4879.88 --> 4881.10]  I'm not down on that
[4881.10 --> 4882.56]  The only thing that confuses me
[4882.56 --> 4883.84]  Is that it's so similar
[4883.84 --> 4885.00]  So like what's
[4885.00 --> 4886.10]  Almost what's the point
[4886.10 --> 4887.08]  In it being an esport
[4887.08 --> 4887.34]  You know
[4887.34 --> 4888.94]  And then there's the last category
[4888.94 --> 4890.00]  Which I haven't looked into
[4890.00 --> 4890.70]  Either of these
[4890.70 --> 4892.10]  But virtual regatta
[4892.10 --> 4893.48]  And virtual taekwondo
[4893.48 --> 4894.70]  They have very obviously
[4894.70 --> 4895.50]  Similar names
[4895.50 --> 4896.84]  They seem to be in
[4896.84 --> 4897.82]  Kind of their own category
[4897.82 --> 4900.04]  Virtual regatta
[4900.04 --> 4901.62]  It's very
[4901.62 --> 4902.92]  Weird
[4902.92 --> 4904.88]  Okay
[4904.88 --> 4906.36]  Olympic esports
[4906.36 --> 4907.36]  Licensed
[4907.36 --> 4908.02]  Virtual regatta
[4908.02 --> 4908.66]  Offshore
[4908.66 --> 4909.62]  At least it's on the play store
[4909.62 --> 4910.48]  And the app store
[4910.48 --> 4911.14]  In short
[4911.14 --> 4913.00]  What am I looking at here?
[4913.86 --> 4914.34]  What is this?
[4914.48 --> 4914.70]  It's on
[4914.70 --> 4915.60]  This is on Instagram
[4915.60 --> 4916.42]  Okay
[4916.42 --> 4918.08]  So virtual regatta
[4918.08 --> 4919.74]  It looks very old
[4919.74 --> 4920.76]  I guess it is a mobile game
[4920.76 --> 4921.52]  It's a mobile game
[4921.52 --> 4923.42]  Okay
[4923.42 --> 4925.28]  You can change your sales
[4925.28 --> 4925.76]  Okay
[4925.76 --> 4926.50]  Let's go
[4926.50 --> 4928.18]  Time to buy some sales
[4928.18 --> 4929.28]  Gamer time
[4929.28 --> 4930.34]  Microtransactions
[4930.34 --> 4931.28]  Let's go
[4931.28 --> 4932.24]  Okay I can't even
[4932.24 --> 4932.94]  I can't even
[4932.94 --> 4933.76]  I don't know that
[4933.76 --> 4935.02]  It's microtransactions
[4935.02 --> 4935.56]  For a fact
[4935.56 --> 4936.38]  Do you have any actual
[4936.38 --> 4937.24]  Gameplay footage
[4937.24 --> 4938.06]  You buttheads?
[4941.38 --> 4942.14]  Oh man
[4942.14 --> 4943.20]  They want us to click on
[4943.20 --> 4943.76]  Floatplane chat
[4943.76 --> 4944.54]  Wants us to click on
[4944.54 --> 4945.18]  The taekwondo
[4945.18 --> 4945.72]  It's like
[4945.72 --> 4946.86]  Kinect simulators
[4946.86 --> 4947.66]  They say
[4947.66 --> 4949.44]  Kinect simulators
[4949.44 --> 4949.84]  You know like
[4949.84 --> 4950.70]  Xbox Kinect
[4950.70 --> 4951.50]  Yeah yeah yeah
[4951.50 --> 4951.98]  Okay
[4951.98 --> 4954.00]  Virtual taekwondo

[5053.38 --> 5053.70]  To look

[5082.22 --> 5083.08]  What is this
[5083.08 --> 5092.70]  I'm so confused right now
[5092.70 --> 5095.50]  Okay
[5095.50 --> 5096.26]  I give up
[5096.26 --> 5097.98]  Let's do some sponsor spots

[5103.78 --> 5106.08]  The show is brought to you today by
[5106.08 --> 5108.80]  Your last discussion question is funny
[5108.80 --> 5109.72]  We didn't get to it but it's funny
[5109.72 --> 5111.54]  Oh we can get to it after
[5111.54 --> 5113.24]  Let's do it
[5113.24 --> 5113.98]  We'll do it after
[5113.98 --> 5116.34]  The show is brought today by Thorum

[5323.18 --> 5329.62]  That's not a good discussion question. I disagree with both of you. It's not a question. It's just a statement, but it's very funny
[5330.22 --> 5335.76]  The discussion question is Skyrim in the Olympics win. I want to see the bronze medalist clip through the podium
[5335.76 --> 5337.76]  Oh
[5337.76 --> 5342.18]  That's great. Oh, it's pretty good
[5342.18 --> 5345.46]  Okay, but yeah, there's a lot of speculation
[5346.58 --> 5353.46]  That a lot of the titles were chosen on the basis of their close relationship to established governing bodies
[5354.02 --> 5356.02]  So developers in Singapore
[5356.02 --> 5362.50]  Yeah, that had close relationships with the governing body in Singapore. I think it's pretty clear. This is all corrupt as fuck and
[5363.78 --> 5365.78]  We should we should
[5365.86 --> 5368.02]  We should reject it everything but the chess one
[5368.66 --> 5371.54]  Yeah, cuz like chess.com is fine. Yeah
[5372.18 --> 5373.78]  All right
[5373.78 --> 5375.86]  Oh, we should do a couple of merch messages
[5376.18 --> 5383.02]  If you guys are wondering the way to interact with the show is not through twitch bits not through super chats over on YouTube
[5383.02 --> 5386.06]  It's through merch messages and we've actually got oh
[5386.06 --> 5389.06]  We've got a crap ton of stuff to announce for the store today, don't we? Yeah
[5389.22 --> 5394.10]  Lots of you who have been paying very close attention will have probably already noticed our
[5394.66 --> 5397.02]  Big product launch of the week
[5397.50 --> 5399.70]  Hey Dan, I think I need to put you back on the camera
[5399.70 --> 5401.70]  He's like
[5401.70 --> 5403.70]  He's like
[5403.70 --> 5405.70]  I'm paying attention. I'm paying attention
[5405.70 --> 5407.70]  Um
[5407.70 --> 5411.70]  If you're going to send a merch message which means that you're not just throwing money into the ether you will also get
[5411.70 --> 5417.70]  An item in the mail is to go on LTT store.com and in the checkout. There's a place to leave a merch message and
[5418.34 --> 5420.34]  One of our new items for this week
[5421.22 --> 5425.06]  I the reason I'm digging this out is because I have a full one. Oh, okay
[5425.06 --> 5427.06]  So here's my loadout for the tech pouch
[5428.42 --> 5432.10]  It's a pouch and you fill it up with tech or toiletries or
[5432.82 --> 5439.06]  Tools or realistically anything else that you could possibly want to fill it with so you want to have a look at my tech pouch
[5439.62 --> 5441.94]  Yeah, you've got it. Can I open up my tech pouch for you?
[5443.22 --> 5445.06]  You can take everything out. Oh my
[5445.06 --> 5450.74]  Feel free to unload it. Let's go. Uh, you might want to move your water bottle a little bit poor Dan is uh, you know
[5450.74 --> 5455.38]  Got a situation. Action can you want it down here. Is that better? Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure
[5455.78 --> 5457.78]  So you've got I don't know what this is
[5458.26 --> 5463.14]  A dock that's an external USB drive just a drive USB SSD. Okay. Yeah
[5463.46 --> 5469.14]  Sometimes I'll have to copy like very large game libraries or whatever else and it's I still have my angel bird
[5469.14 --> 5474.66]  Yeah, yeah, so this that one's a higher capacity is like four terabytes probably a lot bigger. Yeah, uh, he's got a
[5474.66 --> 5476.66]  Compensating
[5477.46 --> 5479.46]  He's got a C3 adapter
[5480.10 --> 5485.86]  I have a much bigger X than Luke and X is external SSD because it sure isn't anything else
[5487.62 --> 5492.02]  These I believe have been accessible to you for many years. Oh, yeah, these are new at all. No, they're not new
[5492.02 --> 5494.10]  They're just headphone adapter things. They're in my thing. Yeah, yeah
[5494.10 --> 5500.26]  You need to go four pole to dual three pole. Yeah, just dump them on the table. Let's go. Let's go. What's in my tech pouch?
[5500.26 --> 5507.30]  C to C like I'm yeah, Thunderbolt Thunderbolt. Yeah, very close. Here it is. Good job. There's the angel. I also have my angel bird
[5507.30 --> 5513.30]  Yeah, I never use it. It just has like some crap on it that I might need once in a while. They're so cool. Yeah, I actually really like them
[5514.58 --> 5518.54]  Okay, so this is an expand ability thing sexy dongle. Yeah, yeah
[5518.54 --> 5524.88]  It's a mind you need for a laptop to make it less annoying to use as a laptop Jerry rig everything nice. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[5525.56 --> 5529.54]  Even misspoke and called it a nice, but I'm down with that. It's pretty nice. LTT screwdriver course
[5530.26 --> 5536.18]  Why wouldn't I so the tools you need all the time for everything my my needle nose pliers and my side cutters would be in there
[5536.18 --> 5541.62]  But I left them at xqc's house. So I asked my assistant to get me some more that makes sense
[5542.34 --> 5547.70]  Sorry, he's still yours. That's hilarious. He apparently took Dan's love it
[5547.70 --> 5551.22]  You've got a like cap for a controller. Yeah, like a thumbstick
[5551.22 --> 5554.74]  That was just garbage that was in my bag that I accidentally threw into the tech pouch
[5554.74 --> 5557.22]  So there's no reason for me to carry that around. I mean it could be useful
[5557.22 --> 5561.78]  That's a my if someone has like a grody thumbstick you just cover it. That's a lavalier mic holder
[5561.78 --> 5564.10]  Um, that makes sense. Yeah, it makes routed on the back
[5564.10 --> 5567.70]  Yeah, it printed the lines on your shirt less noticeable when you're wearing a lav mic
[5567.70 --> 5570.58]  So it's just the kind of thing I would have to carry around that no one else would
[5571.14 --> 5574.50]  Tons more random cables. What the heck yeah, that's like a
[5575.06 --> 5577.94]  Yeah, that's like an everything cable. It can be like adapted
[5578.58 --> 5581.38]  So you can yeah, I see. Yeah, pretty cool, right?
[5581.38 --> 5587.54]  Yeah, so micro B from the same prong thing that Logitech uses. That's because it's for the Logitech mouse that is in there
[5588.02 --> 5590.58]  It just happens to have that adapter on it. Is my mouse not in there?
[5590.58 --> 5596.02]  Where's the mouse? No. Someone take my mouse. Nope. Here's some lavalier tape. Uh, yep. Yep. Yep. That's the medical tape that I use
[5596.18 --> 5601.06]  Yeah, there's an outside zipper that uses the same ykk waterproof
[5601.86 --> 5602.74]  TM
[5602.74 --> 5605.70]  Um, I consider them water resistant, but they call them waterproof
[5605.70 --> 5612.98]  So the same ykk water resistant zippers that you would find on our backpack the same reprieve recycled water bottle material
[5613.14 --> 5617.06]  That's a two and a half gig network card by the way that you're holding. Yeah, is this for the framework? Yeah
[5617.22 --> 5622.10]  Yeah, yeah, so it's it's I think just usb-c to network and so you could use this on anything really
[5622.18 --> 5625.62]  Yeah, but it's made for the framework. Yeah, it pops in. It slots in nicely. Yeah, it's pretty cool
[5625.86 --> 5631.46]  That's cool to have because you could use it for your actual laptop or anything else really. Did someone steal my m.2 ssd?
[5631.54 --> 5633.70]  That's just an external audio like sound card
[5633.70 --> 5637.86]  This thing is actually sweet because it just seems to work on everything. Yeah, I've used this yeah
[5638.02 --> 5640.66]  Yeah, and it's just yeah usb to just 3.5
[5641.14 --> 5648.50]  It literally seems to work with everything some of my tools aren't in there my uh, my pin removal tool is not in there
[5648.58 --> 5653.62]  Oh, oh, they are in there. Oh, who put those in there? Oh, okay. That's great. I don't really take all those
[5653.62 --> 5655.86]  They were playing around with my stuff a little bit for the shoot
[5656.10 --> 5658.18]  But so I have like jeweler screwdrivers
[5658.26 --> 5663.54]  And then I have like an atx pin removal tool molex pin removal tool they're like water cooling fittings
[5663.54 --> 5666.18]  Yeah, every once in a while you never know if you're gonna need a fitting or whatever else
[5666.74 --> 5669.54]  But yeah, do you want to just kind of spread it for me?
[5672.50 --> 5674.74]  Not that part okay that move that's very awkward
[5675.30 --> 5679.78]  Okay, I want to see like the uh, the little the little pockets on the outsides the oh
[5679.78 --> 5680.66]  Oh, like this?
[5680.66 --> 5681.38]  No, no, I oh
[5681.94 --> 5682.58]  You mean this?
[5682.58 --> 5687.22]  Yeah on the outside edges. Yeah, or the inside of the outside. I don't know how well that's gonna show
[5687.78 --> 5690.10]  Um, there's okay, so there's a pouch here. Yeah
[5691.14 --> 5696.58]  Yeah, the elastic ones that are on the orange here. There you go pockets. Oh
[5697.86 --> 5701.86]  So there's lots of pockets. Oh, there's an ssd in there. You never know when you're gonna need an ssd
[5701.86 --> 5703.86]  That actually comes up a lot for me
[5704.02 --> 5707.62]  But if you just give them a bit of a better angle so they can get there we go
[5707.62 --> 5712.18]  So there's like three pouches back here and then the other side has something similar pen holder
[5712.18 --> 5718.18]  Pencil or pen holders there and on this side, there's like just a bunch of loops. Yeah brother
[5718.82 --> 5720.34]  So we we have some loops
[5720.34 --> 5725.06]  We did a lot of internal polling finding out what people wanted to be able to carry around with them
[5725.06 --> 5728.98]  It fits perfectly in the bottom of the backpack obviously with a water bottle next to it
[5729.30 --> 5735.54]  Uh, it's okay. We're back to the main camera now. I think you've made your point, but yeah, it's a tech pouch really high quality materials
[5736.10 --> 5740.82]  And it's on lttstore.com and does it does it fit in a specific spot in the backpack?
[5740.82 --> 5744.18]  It just sits at the very bottom of the main bag of holding. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[5744.74 --> 5747.46]  Uh, we've got a couple other lttstore things to discuss
[5748.10 --> 5753.46]  But people asking for dimensions of the pouch. Is that not just on the store? I hope it is is it not?
[5755.62 --> 5759.46]  Uh, okay, we should get that updated for you all
[5760.18 --> 5761.30]  um
[5761.30 --> 5765.70]  Ah, man, I would look forward to that being in the product information in the future
[5767.06 --> 5769.54]  Yeah, yeah, that'll be that'll be there very soon
[5769.54 --> 5772.50]  D by 900 D? I don't know what that means
[5773.86 --> 5777.22]  Man, what were the other things I was supposed to say about the store dan do you remember?
[5778.42 --> 5780.34]  Oh, yeah, stickers. What are the stickers?
[5781.46 --> 5782.34]  Oh, they're right here
[5782.98 --> 5786.34]  Yeah, oh, uh, then back to the camera
[5787.30 --> 5791.06]  We have a new 2023 sticker pack, so it's in the bonus bin
[5791.06 --> 5796.74]  Which are the the free items that you guys can get on lttstore.com with your order
[5796.74 --> 5800.34]  We so we now have new stickers. That one's really fun. Save that one for last
[5800.34 --> 5803.78]  Yeah, let's do all the other ones first. No one gets to see it. We've got soon tm
[5806.18 --> 5812.50]  I'm holding it next to luke's face. Hey, there we go soon tm. Oh, oh, we got the trust me bro guarantee. Yeah, sarah was like
[5812.50 --> 5817.30]  Yeah, really really I don't need to be that yeah, he doesn't need to be in focus
[5818.42 --> 5820.50]  Yeah, yeah, we're good. We're good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good
[5822.82 --> 5824.58]  Oh boy
[5824.58 --> 5831.30]  Can he do it? Oh, it's locked on your face. It's locked on your face. Okay. Why do you keep putting it over there? Okay? All right
[5832.26 --> 5834.26]  Trust me bro guarantee
[5834.26 --> 5840.98]  There we go. We've got lttstore.com is it calm is it come no one knows can't read it. This is the lab
[5841.54 --> 5847.38]  Yeah, that's a cool reflective e rainbow. Sarah pushed hard for that design. She she really likes it
[5852.02 --> 5854.02]  A little bit of an angle yeah nice
[5855.62 --> 5859.70]  Retro computer cool little little CRT. Yeah, old school computer
[5859.70 --> 5864.82]  Oh, that's a bit of a throwback eggshell. Let's go
[5866.58 --> 5869.78]  That's sweet all the memes from this year takes
[5870.58 --> 5876.26]  Little wansho shout out for us. Yeah, yeah, very nice full of wansho shout outs and the generic classic
[5877.06 --> 5881.46]  Did you just call that the generic what would you call it ltt circle logo?
[5881.70 --> 5887.94]  Obviously generic ltt circle. This is the best one though. This was brilliant. This was sarah's idea. I can't take any credit for it
[5887.94 --> 5894.66]  Um, it's blank. That's actually pretty sweet. So it's it's a it's a window like a like an explorer window
[5895.22 --> 5898.18]  And it's a tech tip so you can write any tech tip you want
[5898.74 --> 5901.86]  Yeah, so cool, right and based on the material
[5902.50 --> 5905.62]  I don't want to say that you could I think you can erase it be able to erase it. Yeah
[5906.90 --> 5911.06]  So you could like update your tech tip. That's actually pretty sweet. That's a good idea. Those are cool. Those are all good
[5911.46 --> 5913.06]  the last big update is
[5913.06 --> 5918.82]  Because we finally have some bloody printed shirts in stock. Let's go screwdriver t-shirt is back
[5919.38 --> 5923.62]  Case t-shirt is back the one i'm wearing today the display
[5924.82 --> 5932.50]  Panel layers shirt is back and so is the headphone shirt. There you go. So we finally
[5933.46 --> 5935.14]  Finally have some shirts back in stock
[5935.14 --> 5940.34]  By the way, if you were signed up to get a notification when these came back in stock and you got like seven notifications
[5940.98 --> 5944.34]  Let support know because we had an issue with that
[5944.34 --> 5948.02]  So we actually turned off our back in stock notifications while we were trying to solve it
[5948.02 --> 5950.58]  We're just gonna have to make our own thing eventually. Oh, really?
[5951.14 --> 5954.26]  Probably why can't shopify plugins not just work?
[5954.98 --> 5957.22]  Some of them do. I don't feel like i'm asking for that much
[5957.62 --> 5959.78]  Some of them do all right. Well at any rate
[5960.66 --> 5963.78]  But we've had like other problems with it and it's just getting kind of
[5963.78 --> 5970.74]  Frustrating at this point. It's it's not like super high on the list, but I feel like someday it's it's gonna just
[5971.94 --> 5978.90]  Yeah, all right. Well hit me with a couple merch messages dan and then we'll get into some more topics
[5978.90 --> 5980.90]  And then we'll do some more merch messages
[5980.98 --> 5986.66]  Maybe we'll get some get some dinner do wanshow after hours. No, probably probably not. I think we might treat
[5986.66 --> 5991.86]  We could wrap this up really now we're doing it. Yeah, if we're gonna be here for like the next 10 hours
[5992.98 --> 5999.86]  Yeah, 24 hour wanshow when yeah, I was gonna say why you have a producer someone just keep you fed someone just beat ludwig's record
[6000.42 --> 6004.34]  uh, his like subathon record and I was thinking we should just do a like
[6005.38 --> 6008.58]  Subathon wanshow where we just swap the hosts out
[6009.54 --> 6015.06]  And the wanshow just keeps going forever the wanshow never sleeps. Yeah, the wanshow never stops
[6015.06 --> 6020.26]  Yeah, I got a question for you. If I buy you dinner. Did you technically buy yourself dinner?
[6021.06 --> 6023.06]  Uh, if you expense it then yes
[6024.98 --> 6029.54]  All right, I got one here from griffin hey guys starting a new it job next week
[6029.54 --> 6032.58]  And I thought the screwdriver would be the perfect gift to myself
[6032.58 --> 6036.98]  Any comment on why the tech pouch looks eerily similar to the peak design one?
[6037.54 --> 6040.82]  Um, honestly, we started from a very different place
[6041.46 --> 6046.26]  I had never seen the peak design one until I saw people mention it in the um
[6046.90 --> 6053.78]  In the in the chat before the show. So I was like, oh, I will go look at this a lot of times like there's there's people that
[6054.50 --> 6056.50]  completely unrelated like pre-internet
[6057.30 --> 6060.58]  They'll invent the same thing at the same time different parts of the world calculus
[6060.82 --> 6065.22]  I mean, I have I have no doubt that our designers probably looked at other options on the market
[6065.22 --> 6069.06]  What is different about this one is that the layout of the inside is?
[6069.78 --> 6073.46]  Very much tailored to what our team requested. Yeah
[6073.46 --> 6073.86]  Yeah
[6073.86 --> 6079.46]  Um, so we like we made sure that the uh, so here hold on one sec
[6079.46 --> 6082.26]  And a lot of it's like the materials involved like it's the reprieve
[6082.82 --> 6087.14]  Fabric against it's made from water bottles, but I just i've always appreciated perfect uh personally
[6087.14 --> 6089.94]  So here's a bit of feedback that I gave them early on in the process
[6089.94 --> 6095.62]  I was like these pouches need to be able to hold like a gaming mouse not just a magic mouse
[6095.94 --> 6098.42]  um, that was something that we observed from um
[6099.06 --> 6101.78]  Some of the samples that we did bring in where I was like this is stupid
[6102.10 --> 6105.38]  Like I can't even put a mouse in this thing. How am I supposed to operate without a mouse?
[6105.62 --> 6108.66]  Also, if you have an ltt backpack it like perfectly
[6109.22 --> 6111.62]  Visually matches which I think is cool
[6112.90 --> 6113.94]  I like the orange
[6114.66 --> 6118.42]  I haven't looked at the peak one. I have no idea if they have like highly visible fabric
[6118.42 --> 6121.62]  It's probably good. I've heard very very good things about their stuff
[6121.62 --> 6128.26]  Everyone that I know that has bought peak design stuff is very happy with it. Yep. I mean that's the thing right is ltt store is not um
[6129.22 --> 6132.10]  I don't see us as like a bitter rival with anyone, you know
[6132.10 --> 6139.62]  Like just because we have a screwdriver does that make us a milwaukee competitor. Yeah, like no realistically. No, it's it's not our primary business
[6140.02 --> 6140.98]  it's
[6140.98 --> 6145.54]  um, you know, I think that we take a very different approach to merch, you know
[6145.54 --> 6151.22]  I don't like calling it merch because I think their products, you know, I don't think they're just merch
[6151.22 --> 6154.82]  I don't think we just silk screen our logo on things, but I don't think people
[6155.70 --> 6156.50]  uh
[6156.50 --> 6157.38]  like
[6157.38 --> 6162.98]  I think with some creators merch the driving idea behind buying their merch is just supporting the creator
[6163.30 --> 6168.66]  I think with our stuff which it also sucks to call merch. Yeah is you're buying good stuff
[6168.90 --> 6172.74]  Yeah, and by the way it also building a lab. Yeah, let's go
[6172.74 --> 6176.82]  It also supports the like vision and direction of the company and all that kind of stuff, but
[6177.38 --> 6182.50]  You're you're you're buying the stuff because it's actually just really good stuff. We shipped out the screwdriver and had
[6183.06 --> 6184.50]  Like tool
[6184.50 --> 6188.90]  Reviewers review it and it reviewed really well because we're trying to make really good stuff
[6189.54 --> 6191.38]  Not because we're just trying to make random merch
[6191.94 --> 6194.90]  We could have man. We could have made a screwdriver a lot the shirts are like
[6195.38 --> 6199.46]  Great. I love our shirt and they went through a lot of revision to get to a point where they're good
[6199.46 --> 6204.58]  And yada yada yada like it's it's not it's not just like puked out merch to in order to support a creator
[6204.58 --> 6208.50]  Which i'm not even dogging on nope. It's just not it wasn't our approach. That's all
[6209.38 --> 6214.10]  I have bought merch from creators with the sole idea of it supporting the creator. Yep
[6214.66 --> 6216.66]  And i'm totally fine with that
[6216.66 --> 6218.10]  I think i only ever did it once
[6218.10 --> 6223.70]  Didn't survive a super long time, but like I was really doing it to support the creator. Yeah, my burnt face man
[6224.10 --> 6226.10]  um hoodie
[6226.10 --> 6230.58]  Lasted pretty okay until I lost it so I don't know how long it would have lasted. Yeah. Yeah
[6234.02 --> 6236.02]  Um, okay two more and then get back to yeah
[6236.66 --> 6239.86]  Next up is from mike love this tech purse
[6240.18 --> 6247.38]  Uh, was there any follow-up to the uncensored wan show exploded monetization or anything excited to hit five hours on wan show tonight
[6248.34 --> 6252.74]  No, no, it monetization actually stayed active even though we like
[6253.30 --> 6256.90]  Cussed a bunch and all that i was pretty surprised me too. I thought it was gonna get
[6257.62 --> 6259.86]  Age gated or something, but it just went
[6261.22 --> 6265.14]  That was the one that was the one where I was surprised that it was live
[6266.34 --> 6267.86]  And I got caught totally off guard
[6268.42 --> 6272.66]  Yeah, because I just sat there for so long at the beginning thinking oh it couldn't possibly have started yet
[6272.66 --> 6275.14]  That I realized that it was that the show was started
[6275.14 --> 6281.86]  Yeah, yeah, I remember because because I had intended to start like
[6282.34 --> 6287.78]  Swearing a bunch right the second the show started because I I know that in the first little bit it matters more
[6288.26 --> 6294.34]  And so some people had commented. Oh, yeah, he probably waited because of what no I waited because my dashboard
[6295.06 --> 6299.62]  Usually has a 10 to 20 to even 30 second delay before it actually goes live
[6299.62 --> 6302.26]  But it went live immediately that time and I didn't realize
[6303.86 --> 6310.98]  Okay, last one for this sections from anthony linus. What is your biggest regret as far as decisions you've made for lmg?
[6311.38 --> 6313.06]  He's just spicy
[6313.06 --> 6315.30]  My goodness biggest regret
[6319.46 --> 6321.46]  Not taking the offer
[6321.70 --> 6328.82]  No, no, no, I don't regret that actually I i worried I would I did I ever did I ever say how much the offer was
[6329.62 --> 6331.62]  No, no, no, oh
[6334.02 --> 6340.82]  Well, it wasn't six figures and it wasn't seven and it sure as hell wasn't five or under
[6344.90 --> 6345.14]  Yeah
[6346.98 --> 6349.62]  There's a lot it wasn't eight either
[6353.22 --> 6355.54]  So that should give you some idea yeah, um
[6355.54 --> 6362.74]  I have not regretted it for a moment. I I think that the timing was perfect to
[6363.38 --> 6364.34]  To take an offer
[6364.90 --> 6366.90]  um, we were having an absolutely
[6367.46 --> 6369.46]  We were in the midst of an explosive
[6370.02 --> 6375.22]  It was it was pre-income from backpack and screwdriver. Yes, but
[6375.78 --> 6381.46]  um, you know, we had let we left the door open to kind of say hey, here's how we're projecting that's gonna go
[6381.46 --> 6387.86]  And we had had some discussions about how that offer might change if they crushed it the way that we thought they could
[6387.86 --> 6389.70]  Got it. Um, and so
[6390.50 --> 6396.58]  Knowing that we were heading into a period I think 2023 2024 are going to be reinvestment periods
[6397.30 --> 6399.86]  So if we were looking for an exit
[6400.50 --> 6401.30]  um
[6401.30 --> 6404.58]  2022 was the year to do it because we were
[6405.46 --> 6406.58]  hockey sticking like
[6406.58 --> 6414.66]  Absolutely, absolutely crazy lots of cool stuff on the road map, but the costs for that cool stuff hadn't started to hit us yet
[6415.14 --> 6420.74]  Like building out the lab has been phenomenally expensive honestly like if you bought a screwdriver if you bought a backpack if you
[6421.22 --> 6426.66]  uh sent any kind of merch message if you any anything anything yeah
[6426.66 --> 6432.02]  If you subscribe on floatplane, you're a huge part of of why this this vision is happening because
[6432.66 --> 6434.98]  um, well because we couldn't do it otherwise
[6435.62 --> 6436.66]  It's that simple, right?
[6436.66 --> 6439.06]  Um, so if we wanted to take an offer
[6439.78 --> 6446.74]  That would have been the time to do it knowing that we were going to be heading into a couple of years that we're not going to see profits grow
[6447.46 --> 6454.02]  Maybe even shrink right now. We are we are down year over year in terms of profitability. Don't worry. We're fine. Everything is fine
[6454.18 --> 6455.22]  we're still profitable, but
[6455.94 --> 6457.94]  We're down compared to last year
[6457.94 --> 6461.62]  Um, and that's even even before factoring in screwdriver and backpack, right?
[6462.02 --> 6462.66]  And so
[6463.38 --> 6464.50]  Because
[6464.50 --> 6466.90]  the kinds of companies that like acquire
[6467.78 --> 6474.74]  You know pieces and build portfolios are looking not just at your your your like some multiple of your ebita
[6475.22 --> 6475.78]  um
[6476.26 --> 6484.74]  It's it's what kind of multiple you get right the bigger the the growth they expect the the the bigger multiple you might get
[6484.74 --> 6488.82]  In terms of the valuation of your company, so evita would be like your earnings before
[6488.82 --> 6490.82]  taxes
[6491.46 --> 6492.50]  Something something
[6492.50 --> 6495.94]  But basically like your your your net income um
[6497.14 --> 6497.46]  And
[6498.26 --> 6500.74]  Or your your your net profit whatever whatever it is
[6500.90 --> 6504.26]  So so pretty much how much money you made so they will basically go okay
[6504.82 --> 6506.90]  That amount it let's say times
[6507.46 --> 6513.46]  Three or times five or times nine or or whatever it is is how much we're going to offer for your company because we will expect that
[6513.46 --> 6519.14]  It will continue to make money and we will we will make that money back on our investment over some period of time
[6519.14 --> 6522.34]  And the the more your growth looks explosive
[6522.90 --> 6526.02]  The higher that offer because you could basically argue well
[6526.02 --> 6528.34]  Yeah, you sure you could give me five exebitat today
[6528.34 --> 6533.78]  But but the earnings you're going to get in this next four or five years here is going to be so much more because we're growing like this
[6534.10 --> 6536.10]  So the time to take it was 2022
[6536.10 --> 6539.38]  And the not time to take it is
[6540.42 --> 6543.22]  2023 2024 because I I know I knew
[6543.86 --> 6546.42]  That that wasn't going to keep happening the way that it was
[6547.06 --> 6547.86]  um
[6547.86 --> 6550.82]  You know obviously if all goes according to plan
[6551.54 --> 6557.06]  I'm going to look back at the 2022 offer and I'm going to say well I would have been an idiot to take that because my vision was great
[6557.54 --> 6558.58]  and
[6558.58 --> 6561.14]  You know we're worth twice as much or three times as much
[6561.86 --> 6568.10]  But I know there's gonna be a lull here. Yeah, so um, so i'm so i'm in it to win it. Um
[6568.98 --> 6569.38]  and
[6570.50 --> 6572.50]  Even if that doesn't happen
[6573.38 --> 6574.66]  There's times that i've thought
[6575.46 --> 6577.46]  You know should I have
[6577.46 --> 6579.62]  Right like should I have taken the bag and run
[6580.34 --> 6585.86]  Taking the ball and gone home and to to your credit if you were just financially motivated
[6586.98 --> 6588.82]  I mean you said the amount of figures right?
[6588.82 --> 6591.46]  I did basically you would have been
[6593.38 --> 6596.42]  Chillaxing to the end of all cool. Yeah
[6597.38 --> 6601.94]  What was some b-ball outside of the school or whatever like that? Yeah, so like
[6603.54 --> 6609.06]  Clearly it's not just financial motivation. Um, i've got unfinished business. I think that's a big part of it
[6609.06 --> 6613.62]  Um, I don't think that the team would have been happy. Uh, there's there's a lot that we could unpack
[6613.62 --> 6616.66]  I don't think we're going to talk in detail. There's a lot of different angles. Yeah, yeah
[6616.66 --> 6618.66]  Yeah, um, but
[6620.34 --> 6624.10]  The bottom line is that would have been the time to take it. I forget what the question was
[6624.98 --> 6630.66]  Uh, what's your biggest regret? Oh, yeah jokingly pointed that out. Yeah, so that was obviously no
[6631.14 --> 6633.14]  I have not regretted it
[6633.78 --> 6635.78]  um
[6635.78 --> 6637.22]  It's hard for
[6637.22 --> 6644.82]  Seeing where we came from and where we are today. How on earth can I possibly say regret about any of it?
[6644.82 --> 6647.94]  Part of my I guess we might get into this later, but I've been yeah
[6648.66 --> 6651.86]  Reorganizing and and getting rid of a bunch of old stuff and whatnot
[6652.10 --> 6656.66]  And I was finding some old hard drives that I had stashed away and making sure that I had all the data off them
[6656.66 --> 6656.98]  Yeah, yeah
[6656.98 --> 6662.34]  And basically in every case I I did but I was still sorting through old stuff and I found my
[6662.82 --> 6664.82]  like archived
[6664.82 --> 6666.82]  forum folder
[6666.82 --> 6668.82]  Oh, and I found a bunch of like
[6669.38 --> 6671.38]  Like when my twitter account passed
[6671.38 --> 6679.22]  1,337 followers I have like a screenshot of when it got exactly then I have a bunch of the screenshots from the the v bulletin days
[6679.54 --> 6683.70]  Oh of the forum nice. Um, I have this screenshot from when
[6684.26 --> 6684.66]  uh
[6684.66 --> 6686.50]  wind speed and I
[6686.50 --> 6693.62]  Were dealing with a certain server host that i'm not going to point out because we we were uh, we requested an ipkvm
[6694.26 --> 6697.86]  And they hooked it up to someone else's server and then gave us the access to it
[6698.74 --> 6700.90]  So we had full direct
[6701.62 --> 6704.26]  Control over someone else's server
[6706.50 --> 6714.34]  And I screenshot the communication log of wind speed and I being like guys you need to take this away from us. What are you doing?
[6714.34 --> 6722.58]  I've had a bunch of old stuff like that that was that was quite the the memory lane to go down the the old
[6722.58 --> 6727.62]  Original design of the forum when it finally came over to ips like all this other kind of stuff
[6728.18 --> 6730.18]  It's very cool
[6730.18 --> 6731.06]  Oh
[6731.06 --> 6732.66]  Screenshots from razors
[6733.54 --> 6735.54]  Like discord competitor
[6735.54 --> 6740.10]  Oh comms. Yeah, good old comms man. Yeah, there's so it's been yeah
[6740.66 --> 6742.66]  It's been a ride. It's been a ride
[6742.66 --> 6745.14]  You know what? Okay
[6746.18 --> 6746.42]  Um
[6747.22 --> 6751.38]  I don't think we would have done the sponsored video on the facebook portal
[6753.30 --> 6756.74]  Or was it something I don't know there was some like
[6758.18 --> 6762.10]  Yeah, I don't know is facebook even the worst of the tech giants they're all just sort of terrible
[6763.30 --> 6769.38]  Um, there's a lot of stuff where the question is biggest regret. I could easily come up with regrets. Yeah, but for
[6769.38 --> 6772.82]  To single something out and go biggest regret
[6774.50 --> 6775.06]  That's tough
[6776.26 --> 6779.78]  And it's that's tough regrets are hard thing too because like
[6781.22 --> 6781.46]  Yes
[6782.58 --> 6786.90]  Maybe not doing that thing would have been better. Yeah, it implies you would have done it differently exactly
[6786.90 --> 6791.30]  With all the information that I have now would I do that differently?
[6791.62 --> 6795.70]  Like yeah, but also it clearly didn't hurt us that much so maybe not
[6795.70 --> 6799.54]  And it's not a super applicable real question because you didn't have all that information
[6799.54 --> 6800.50]  So like what?
[6800.50 --> 6803.78]  And even the times that we have financially engaged with facebook
[6803.78 --> 6807.78]  We haven't done anything that that breaches our in internal ethics guidelines
[6807.78 --> 6812.02]  Like we didn't we never said anything or external ones. We never said anything. We didn't believe
[6812.02 --> 6817.14]  We specifically in the I think it was the quest one we did a sponsored video
[6817.14 --> 6822.26]  We specifically told facebook look we are simply not doing this if we can't address the
[6822.58 --> 6826.98]  requirement of a facebook account and like these things we're not going to gloss over these
[6827.30 --> 6833.78]  And we held our we held up we held the line we drew our line in the sand and if companies are okay with that line then like who cares?
[6833.78 --> 6835.86]  Yeah, then from my point of view i'm sitting here going
[6835.86 --> 6839.14]  Okay, so you want to basically pay me to make the video I would have made anyway like okay?
[6839.14 --> 6847.22]  Yeah, yeah, I I've done a lot of those over the years sure a really good example of that was the micron factory tour like
[6849.06 --> 6852.18]  Silly micron come here regardless. Yeah, they didn't they didn't have to give me any money
[6852.18 --> 6855.22]  But I still I had the business team. I was like no no grind them
[6855.22 --> 6859.46]  Grind them put the screws to them because like i'm running a business here, right?
[6859.46 --> 6865.54]  I can't you have to do like I can't pay luke and dan in a great experience that I had in idaho
[6865.54 --> 6867.54]  Right like
[6868.66 --> 6869.46]  Let me let can I?
[6869.46 --> 6872.66]  I mean there's been some times you know what else I found on that server?
[6875.62 --> 6876.90]  Uh oh were there pay stubs?
[6876.90 --> 6877.54]  Yeah
[6877.54 --> 6878.10]  Oh no
[6879.54 --> 6883.94]  I don't take responsibility for the NCIX ones so that was not my fault
[6884.90 --> 6889.14]  In in november before we broke off okay, not my problem
[6889.14 --> 6895.30]  So yeah, it's it's NCIX days good. I have an email sent to you because as much as it was NCIX you were my boss
[6896.10 --> 6898.10]  But I have an email sent to linus
[6898.58 --> 6906.98]  With an invoice and a request of like could this be paid relatively soon because I haven't been paid in two and a half months
[6908.50 --> 6910.50]  And I need money
[6911.38 --> 6918.02]  And I looked at the invoice and I remembered that I used to get paid five dollars per LTT video
[6921.94 --> 6923.94]  That is not my fault
[6924.98 --> 6927.14]  Actually though and I fed him
[6928.10 --> 6928.58]  You did?
[6928.58 --> 6929.62]  That was out of pocket
[6929.62 --> 6938.90]  That invoice was genuinely hilarious to like read over
[6940.50 --> 6943.46]  And I would like to I would like to make another point
[6944.18 --> 6947.62]  Has a paycheck from Linus Media Group Incorporated ever been late?
[6947.62 --> 6947.86]  No
[6949.30 --> 6950.90]  Okay, and and
[6950.90 --> 6952.42]  Dan late paychecks
[6953.94 --> 6955.06]  Never never never
[6955.06 --> 6956.90]  Yeah, you can say if they've been late
[6956.90 --> 6960.42]  Well, I don't get paychecks so you know well, okay? Yeah, we do direct deposit now
[6960.42 --> 6961.22]  We used to do paycheck
[6961.22 --> 6963.86]  We did paychecks for a shockingly long time
[6963.86 --> 6966.90]  I didn't want to give it up because it like cost like a dollar more or something
[6967.70 --> 6970.34]  So funny, I remember just be like come on
[6971.54 --> 6977.78]  But yeah, it was it was five bucks per per LTT and if I remember that's Canadian rubles too
[6978.18 --> 6980.18]  Yeah
[6981.38 --> 6982.18]  It was I don't know
[6982.18 --> 6983.22]  It's funny now
[6983.22 --> 6984.98]  It wasn't that funny then
[6984.98 --> 6989.46]  Yeah, I remember there was one time that Linus called me i'm sure you remember this
[6989.94 --> 6990.26]  um
[6990.90 --> 6995.38]  Telling me that like they were gonna have to do something different with the taxes that were on my
[6996.34 --> 7002.02]  Thing oh, okay, I don't remember the exact details, but I remember I like freaked out
[7002.02 --> 7006.18]  I like broke down because at this point in time I was eating two meals a day
[7006.18 --> 7010.90]  And it was very often that one of those meals was a single bowl of nongshim ramen
[7010.90 --> 7014.26]  Yeah, and I was like skimping on toothpaste
[7014.26 --> 7018.82]  I was stealing toothpaste and food from my parents house when I could yeah, and I was sleeping on a cot
[7019.62 --> 7023.70]  Somewhat illegally because my ex roommates were renting
[7024.18 --> 7028.98]  Literally a cot in the living room to me because I couldn't afford a room anymore
[7028.98 --> 7032.02]  Yeah, and the landlord didn't actually even know I was there
[7032.02 --> 7038.26]  Was that the place you were living where there was the guy that played cod zombies and smoked pot and that was basically all he did?
[7038.26 --> 7041.54]  Yeah, how did he have more money than you because he had a job at?
[7043.06 --> 7045.14]  What's that auto parts store that will like drive?
[7045.54 --> 7051.38]  Yeah, yeah, okay. He had a job at lord co okay like a part-time job at lord co like massively out earned
[7051.38 --> 7054.26]  What I was doing?
[7054.98 --> 7058.74]  But like at that point, I don't know at that point in time I was the hell were you doing?
[7058.74 --> 7061.54]  No wonder your parents told you you were an idiot for hanging around with me
[7062.90 --> 7065.06]  Um, I don't know I saw the vision
[7066.02 --> 7070.98]  And at that point in time I could do it. I don't think I could live like that anymore. I mean either like I
[7071.30 --> 7076.18]  I couldn't do what we did 10 years ago. Yeah, I know it's it's a young person's game doing that like now
[7076.74 --> 7081.94]  Like now the game is putting up moats, right? Yeah, we're in the castle
[7082.34 --> 7086.74]  So it's like all right, we have to do our best build moat to do the best we possibly can
[7087.06 --> 7091.70]  Yeah to make it so that people who can work 18 hours a day
[7092.58 --> 7096.42]  Still can't make up the difference whether it's building building a team
[7096.82 --> 7104.26]  That's a moat because that's more ex there's more expertise in this building than any one person could possibly hope to have in
[7104.90 --> 7107.94]  50 lifetimes like there really is so that's a moat
[7108.50 --> 7112.26]  Uh equipment like lab equipment. That's a moat, you know
[7112.50 --> 7114.50]  A newcomer can't afford it right?
[7114.82 --> 7118.58]  The business team the business relationships. That's another moat because
[7119.46 --> 7122.10]  You know, even if we have a rough month in terms of views
[7122.10 --> 7126.50]  We can count on those relationships and those negotiations to go kind of go. Hey, look
[7127.06 --> 7130.98]  Uh, no, you guys need to still pay the same rates. We're gonna get our feet back under us
[7130.98 --> 7133.86]  Don't worry. We got this right. We can buy time essentially
[7134.34 --> 7138.98]  Um, so we're yeah, so we've we've got we've got moats, but pulling all-nighters
[7139.86 --> 7141.86]  That ain't a moat that we can build anymore
[7142.42 --> 7147.06]  Jaden says in flow plane chat in quotes. How did he make more money than you and then in quotes again?
[7147.06 --> 7149.06]  He had a job that paid minimum wage
[7150.82 --> 7154.74]  I think that's literally true. I think that's literally what happened
[7154.74 --> 7162.02]  But I don't know I we we were communicating pretty early on about like
[7162.82 --> 7164.82]  We should take this
[7164.82 --> 7169.78]  To another level like this is not the goal the original idea was that I would work
[7170.02 --> 7171.62]  I've said this a bunch of times on the mind show
[7171.62 --> 7174.58]  The original idea was that I would work with linus four to eight hours a week
[7175.46 --> 7179.30]  And then within like a week of working together. We were like, uh
[7179.30 --> 7184.90]  Uh, we could crank more we could do more with this we can release more episodes
[7185.06 --> 7188.42]  We could go to a daily release schedule. We could do this other thing with ncx
[7188.66 --> 7194.58]  We could include this like tech linked thing or I don't remember what it's called net linked at that time net linked weekly or whatever
[7194.74 --> 7200.42]  We could start doing these other things we could start pushing further pushing more and then I kind of saw like
[7201.22 --> 7206.42]  You know what? I think this kind of is the future of of media and I think we're kind of on the cusp of it
[7206.42 --> 7210.02]  Yeah, this is not exactly what I thought I was gonna do
[7210.26 --> 7213.06]  Yeah, but like either I kind of want to go this route
[7213.06 --> 7217.14]  It seems more interesting and then just I was at an age where I could do it
[7217.38 --> 7219.38]  I could deal with those types of problems
[7219.70 --> 7222.02]  one of the benefits was that linus was
[7223.06 --> 7229.06]  At least to some level okay with me literally falling asleep at the job because I was still going to school full-time
[7229.38 --> 7231.38]  Trying to study to keep good grades because
[7231.78 --> 7234.50]  When I first started working with linus, I was like
[7235.30 --> 7239.54]  Very high not necessarily top in my class. I was top in my class in one or two classes
[7240.26 --> 7245.54]  But at bcit I had a huge course load. So definitely not all of them, but I was doing very well in school
[7246.90 --> 7250.66]  So I was trying to keep that up and then working with you is supposed to be four to eight hours
[7250.66 --> 7255.86]  Which would have been sustainable, but then we 10x it and then that stopped being sustainable very quickly
[7255.86 --> 7260.98]  So I was literally sleeping like behind the camera nothing so I would be so
[7261.70 --> 7266.18]  The biggest downtime I would have in the day outside of like literally one to three hours a night of sleeping
[7266.50 --> 7269.54]  Was like I'd press record and there's nothing for me to do for like five minutes
[7269.54 --> 7274.34]  So I would literally fall asleep in the chair. Yeah, and then he'd have to like yell at me and I'd wake up and stop recording
[7276.02 --> 7278.02]  It was crazy. Yeah
[7278.58 --> 7280.58]  Yeah
[7280.58 --> 7282.58]  It's easier now
[7284.42 --> 7290.90]  Some people are asking what I mean by moats. It's it's barriers to entry so it's it's competitive advantages
[7290.90 --> 7294.82]  it's ways that we can take what we're good at and
[7295.54 --> 7302.10]  Compete with our strengths against what someone else's strength might be and their strength might be that they don't need sleep
[7302.42 --> 7305.46]  And they don't have children or you know, whatever else the case may be
[7306.02 --> 7306.82]  um
[7306.82 --> 7309.94]  By the way, dan I do monitor float plane chat
[7310.74 --> 7312.74]  No, you don't
[7313.06 --> 7318.82]  What do you say people are asking I think I just I'm just I'm just tuning in here for a second
[7319.38 --> 7322.42]  People are asking about the christmas album remaster
[7323.14 --> 7328.26]  And dan replied to someone I have decided to do something worse with it
[7328.50 --> 7332.82]  Okay, sir. We've been through this you are not deciding what happens to the christmas album
[7332.82 --> 7338.42]  I have decided that the christmas album is going to be left dead and buried and then dan goes
[7338.42 --> 7340.58]  I can't say anything linus is here
[7341.14 --> 7342.26]  You've said enough
[7343.30 --> 7345.46]  And yes, I am here and I see it
[7346.74 --> 7349.62]  How many christmas albums did we sell last week thousands?
[7350.74 --> 7354.66]  That is last week specifically. I don't actually know the exact number
[7354.66 --> 7358.10]  um, but I know that at as of right now
[7358.10 --> 7362.10]  We are in the thousands of totals sold and it's definitely
[7363.06 --> 7365.14]  A ton more than it was before
[7365.86 --> 7370.42]  To the point where if I mercox I sent you a message. I think we've revenued over four grand on it
[7370.42 --> 7372.58]  Linus tech
[7373.30 --> 7374.98]  Linus tech tips
[7376.26 --> 7377.54]  Christmas album
[7377.94 --> 7381.78]  I think someone put it on spotify and I actually don't think it was us
[7383.46 --> 7389.54]  Okay, someone's selling it on bandcamp like yeah, I think someone pirated this and put it on bandcamp. I don't think this is us
[7390.66 --> 7393.86]  I doubt it's us because i'm pretty sure we only sell it through the forum
[7394.90 --> 7395.14]  Yeah
[7395.14 --> 7397.14]  I
[7397.14 --> 7399.86]  Give you my permission to go download the pirated one
[7400.34 --> 7404.98]  I mean, we're gonna pull it down at some point so go fast, but I don't pay money for it, please
[7407.06 --> 7407.78]  Oh
[7407.78 --> 7412.50]  A prime says we have apparently actually had one late paycheck. It was by a day or a couple of days
[7412.50 --> 7414.50]  I can't remember the exact time it has been years
[7415.14 --> 7421.54]  All right, well apparently we've had one i'd have to check because that might have been that might have been unique to a prime though
[7421.54 --> 7426.90]  Because I think the last time I checked with von she told me that we hadn't been we hadn't been late on a pay period
[7427.38 --> 7432.18]  If we get to 2k purchases can dan remaster it because it's currently at 1333
[7432.18 --> 7436.82]  Well, ideally no one buys it. Yeah, that would be the best. I just told you guys
[7436.90 --> 7438.90]  I just gave you my blessing
[7438.90 --> 7443.38]  To go down know the pirated one we don't ltd store everything on it has to be good
[7443.94 --> 7445.46]  Oh, yeah, it's not going on ltd store
[7445.46 --> 7449.22]  We can't there can be garbage on the forum. They want it to be a bonus bin item
[7449.22 --> 7455.06]  Even that like is my version gonna be good enough for the store. You're not going to have a version dan. We've been through this
[7456.02 --> 7461.22]  All right, one last merch message message and then we'll get into some topics here. Okay. Okay, that sounds great
[7461.22 --> 7467.62]  Uh, this one's from austin. We know a lot about your house linus, but luke what is your favorite part of your home?
[7468.34 --> 7470.34]  uh
[7470.42 --> 7472.42]  Yeah
[7472.42 --> 7475.46]  Is it is it the leaking plumbing?
[7477.38 --> 7482.18]  Or the stuffy upstairs sleeping area or the um
[7482.82 --> 7490.02]  the the ace the ac mini split that leaks if you leave it on overnight could it only time I would want it to be on could it be the um
[7492.10 --> 7494.10]  Let me think
[7494.34 --> 7499.30]  He's he's cat he's had kind of bad luck. Yeah, to be perfectly honest with you a bit of a lemon
[7499.30 --> 7501.30]  Um
[7503.62 --> 7505.38]  So just for you guys
[7506.50 --> 7509.70]  If you happen to see luke's place for sale at some point
[7510.98 --> 7515.22]  Don't buy it don't worry you'll find you'll find some sucker to buy it luke
[7517.46 --> 7522.10]  But if you're shopping in the metro vancouver area comfortable just ask the realtor hey
[7522.10 --> 7524.90]  Does the seller's name happen to be luke lafreniere?
[7525.70 --> 7529.54]  And if they say yes, like you guys are gonna know but no one else will know luke it's okay
[7530.18 --> 7533.78]  You guys are gonna know if he says yes, you just say thank you very much
[7534.26 --> 7538.42]  James like you have a mini split jealous. Don't be that jealous. I can't use it
[7538.42 --> 7544.50]  I've brought in three different people to try to fix it. No one can fix it. It just leaks all the time
[7544.58 --> 7547.86]  It just leaks it only leaks and people like oh have you cleaned the filters? Yes
[7547.86 --> 7553.70]  It just leaks it's in the bedroom
[7553.70 --> 7559.22]  The only time I would want it on is when i'm sleeping meaning it's gonna be on for uh eight hours
[7559.46 --> 7560.82]  ideally
[7560.82 --> 7562.90]  If you leave it on for that long at leaks, it just leaks
[7563.78 --> 7568.74]  And then I would need to spend like an insane amount of money to get a new one because they're really expensive
[7569.54 --> 7571.54]  So then it's just like well, I don't really want to do that
[7572.18 --> 7574.18]  Well, I'll tell you what if you move
[7574.50 --> 7580.58]  We will we will we will do we will do like uh cooling diy cooling round two
[7581.14 --> 7582.66]  Let's go let's go
[7583.22 --> 7583.86]  It's it
[7583.86 --> 7585.62]  But we'll only cool your computer
[7585.62 --> 7590.02]  We're gonna cool the inside of your computer case with like a full-size air conditioning unit
[7590.02 --> 7591.62]  I've wanted to do it for a while actually
[7591.86 --> 7595.46]  I'm gonna pivot us to a new topic then because I think I would need that
[7596.10 --> 7602.42]  To use what i'm currently using really the radeon card is so hot oh
[7603.22 --> 7608.66]  Yeah, so we're working on a challenge right now much even compared to your sli setup
[7610.02 --> 7612.02]  Come on that can't be right
[7612.90 --> 7616.10]  No, the dual 1080 is not even close really yeah
[7617.62 --> 7623.14]  Huh like this it might no, I don't think it's the position so much so you know where it's currently mounted
[7623.14 --> 7627.06]  It's in the videos people can see it. It's just like sitting on top of my computer
[7627.38 --> 7629.06]  So it does plume the heat up
[7629.06 --> 7631.06]  Yeah, I wonder if the directionality
[7631.06 --> 7635.22]  And then plumes out but my legs are just like cooking all the time
[7635.22 --> 7635.78]  Yeah, that makes sense
[7635.78 --> 7636.66]  Because of that thing
[7636.66 --> 7639.30]  It's brutal but I mean in the other with the 1080s
[7639.86 --> 7641.46]  It would have gone outside of the case
[7642.74 --> 7644.18]  Because I had the glass off
[7644.18 --> 7649.46]  I was amazed by how well heat rising worked like obviously
[7650.18 --> 7654.34]  I've known heat rises yeah, right hot air rise sure fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[7654.90 --> 7658.26]  But when I tried to do that video using the mining pc
[7658.90 --> 7659.54]  for heat
[7660.66 --> 7662.02]  I just
[7662.02 --> 7664.26]  I don't know. I just I underestimated
[7664.90 --> 7667.78]  Just oh, yeah, it's like gonna go away. Yeah, like yeah, like
[7668.42 --> 7674.26]  Fast so I mounted it right above the monitor kind of blowing at me with fans, you know
[7675.06 --> 7679.70]  And what I realized like later was like later on in the video
[7679.70 --> 7681.62]  I don't know if it actually made it into the final cut
[7681.62 --> 7686.98]  But it was pretty much boomeranging like it it would not go you couldn't force it down
[7687.54 --> 7692.18]  It's like trying to push bubbles down in water. Yeah, and I didn't realize it would be that extreme
[7692.18 --> 7696.34]  I just I don't know never really I just never really thought about it
[7696.34 --> 7698.82]  Which makes you haven't actually done something like that?
[7699.30 --> 7701.70]  Yeah, you probably wouldn't necessarily realize it makes sense
[7701.70 --> 7702.82]  I just didn't really think about it
[7702.82 --> 7707.30]  And so you know one of the things that I again it was I mentioned it in the video
[7707.30 --> 7708.90]  I don't think it made it into the final cut
[7708.90 --> 7711.54]  But I said what I should have done was mounted under the desk
[7711.94 --> 7716.98]  Because then the heat would get trapped by the desk and leak up around me. That's literally so that's what you're doing
[7716.98 --> 7721.22]  And that's probably why the case wasn't as bad because yeah if it's blowing it out the back
[7721.54 --> 7723.38]  It's probably going like
[7723.38 --> 7725.30]  Straight up well and not hitting you
[7725.30 --> 7728.26]  I had the the 1080s that I had with like those triple cooler
[7728.90 --> 7731.38]  I'm trying to remember it strix. Yeah, whatever so it wasn't
[7732.74 --> 7735.78]  But your but your case would have had airflow
[7736.34 --> 7739.06]  Yeah, I had the side of the case the the side of the case off though
[7739.06 --> 7743.38]  Even then though there would be like a suction like it would oh yeah, because the front fans
[7743.38 --> 7744.98]  That makes sense. Yeah, exactly
[7744.98 --> 7746.98]  Yeah, okay, so go at the back. Yeah, yeah
[7746.98 --> 7750.74]  So I don't think it I really don't think it's to do with the actual thermal output
[7750.74 --> 7756.50]  I think it's probably just airflow optimization definitely fair. Yeah, uh speaking of which the um
[7757.62 --> 7763.30]  The case you said case and it reminded me of this again. I'm reorganizing things guess what I dug out of the the
[7763.30 --> 7764.34]  I'm gonna say garage
[7764.34 --> 7766.58]  It's like a slot in the wall because I live in an apartment
[7766.58 --> 7768.10]  But guess what I dug out of the garage
[7768.10 --> 7771.78]  You don't still have your stupid aquarium. Do you uh not that one?
[7773.94 --> 7779.38]  Really that itx what like leftover one that you got the two I believe it's two remaining
[7781.22 --> 7786.74]  Mineral oil cases. I've got them. This is starting to feel a little bit predestined
[7787.62 --> 7790.82]  Because you'll never believe what happened earlier this week
[7790.82 --> 7797.30]  Well, we uploaded that video with the tour of the lab. Okay, and I
[7797.78 --> 7802.18]  Mentioned like mineral oil cooling for some reason either it was in that video or is it?
[7802.74 --> 7805.46]  No, it was on live stream. Sorry. I was on a recent live stream
[7805.46 --> 7811.22]  someone sent a merch message asking about mineral oil cooling when we did that um that build stream and
[7812.74 --> 7817.22]  Somehow a ball got rolling internally without me knowing about it where we started
[7817.22 --> 7822.02]  Mineral oil? No where we start because I said look I think we've said everything we have to say about mineral oil
[7822.34 --> 7827.62]  If we were to do a follow-up with like floor inert or something like that, you know, maybe take it to the next level
[7827.94 --> 7829.22]  You know, maybe we'd revisit it
[7829.22 --> 7833.22]  But even then you can't get these aquarium cases anymore because of a patent troll blah blah blah
[7833.46 --> 7836.98]  So someone internally starts trying to source floor inert and I'm sitting here going
[7837.38 --> 7840.26]  Okay, that's really expensive and really hard to get yeah
[7840.26 --> 7845.78]  Apparently like they just don't even make it anymore basically. Oh, there's some there's like a newer so
[7845.78 --> 7849.54]  Then the conversation somehow made its way to
[7849.94 --> 7853.94]  Jake Danes from the lab and he's like, oh, no, not floor in it. You want this one?
[7853.94 --> 7857.70]  Yeah, it's like for submersion cooling for like mining and gpus and stuff
[7857.70 --> 7861.94]  Yeah, and it even there's like even a cleaner that you can use to get everything back to pristine
[7861.94 --> 7864.42]  He's clearly up to speed and it's a couple hundred bucks
[7864.82 --> 7869.22]  Per five gallon pail which is like it's a committed compared to floor inert
[7870.02 --> 7875.70]  Nothing floor inert was absurd. Yeah, it was cheap relatively. Yeah, and this thing is it's expensive
[7875.70 --> 7880.50]  But it's not like it's closer to mineral oil than it is to floor inert, but it's in the middle floor
[7880.50 --> 7882.74]  No, you were gonna spend like thousands and so I'm sitting here going
[7884.90 --> 7887.62]  We've got cases we've got fluid
[7889.94 --> 7891.62]  Am I gonna be able to avoid this
[7893.30 --> 7895.46]  It's happening. I'll tell you what
[7897.06 --> 7900.18]  What here's the deal okay, we'll build one
[7900.98 --> 7904.18]  But you have to give me back your old computer and you have to daily drive it
[7908.02 --> 7908.34]  Wow
[7909.54 --> 7914.18]  Don't know if I want to do that. It'll be top spec new spec. Oh, yeah, but it's gonna be in oil
[7917.78 --> 7919.22]  I think we need to pull the audience
[7919.94 --> 7923.14]  Should he do it? Should he not? I forget how to set up polls
[7923.14 --> 7927.22]  New top spec in oil is like
[7927.86 --> 7933.22]  Actually quite questionable because the thermal oil it'll be that other stuff. Yeah
[7933.86 --> 7937.30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's designed for gpus and thermal fluid whatever you want to call it. Yeah
[7938.18 --> 7940.98]  It so my comment isn't look at this guy
[7945.06 --> 7948.10]  Just answer the question you want me to do it because you know it's gonna be terrible
[7948.10 --> 7952.90]  Yeah, that's where the pressure is coming from I just want to make sure that everyone understands
[7955.54 --> 7960.26]  I mean they want it for the same reason float plane chat is unanimous here
[7960.26 --> 7961.22]  Let's go
[7961.22 --> 7966.98]  Because it's terrible. What if I use it as a workstation because I'm gonna be here locally again soon
[7967.38 --> 7968.66]  It has to be at home. It has to be at home
[7968.66 --> 7973.38]  No, we will do Luke personal rig update mineral oil edition. It can't even fit all my like drives
[7973.38 --> 7975.70]  Is it is it the ITX one?
[7976.90 --> 7981.14]  Uh, I didn't actually look inside the box if I remember correctly. I have two tanks
[7981.14 --> 7985.14]  I don't think either of them are like ATX tanks. Well, like how much capacity?
[7985.78 --> 7989.14]  I didn't it's just in the shipping. No, I mean how much hard drive capacity do you have?
[7991.06 --> 7993.06]  I currently have two
[7993.86 --> 7995.86]  Very large hard drives
[7996.10 --> 7998.10]  and I have three
[7998.26 --> 7998.98]  like
[7998.98 --> 7999.94]  uh
[7999.94 --> 8001.54]  standard two and a half inch
[8001.54 --> 8004.98]  SSDs three four three or four and then I have two NVMEs
[8005.94 --> 8008.82]  Why do you need so many drives? I have a lot of drives. What the yeah?
[8009.38 --> 8012.10]  I didn't ask if you have a lot of drives. I asked why do you need them?
[8012.58 --> 8014.82]  Uh, I save a lot of stuff
[8015.54 --> 8017.06]  You have a NAS?
[8017.06 --> 8017.30]  Yep
[8019.22 --> 8020.34]  I do
[8020.34 --> 8022.34]  The NAS is huge
[8024.10 --> 8028.10]  I have lots of things okay. Yeah, no I I I clearly um
[8028.10 --> 8030.10]  Um
[8030.42 --> 8031.78]  You're leaving it there aren't you?
[8031.78 --> 8032.10]  Yeah
[8032.10 --> 8032.18]  Yeah
[8034.18 --> 8034.82]  Sakes
[8041.30 --> 8043.14]  How much total space is that? It's a lot
[8044.50 --> 8047.54]  No, each one of the hard drives is like 10 10 terabytes
[8047.54 --> 8048.90]  My deal stands
[8048.90 --> 8053.94]  We will we will load up everything you could possibly need for game storage
[8053.94 --> 8058.18]  We will load you up with enough storage for everything you could possibly need for actual local storage
[8058.18 --> 8063.38]  And we will upgrade the NAS to make up for any space you lose in the desktop
[8063.78 --> 8066.58]  The NAS is all 10 terabyte drives
[8067.46 --> 8069.54]  The NAS also has to be mineral oil cooled
[8073.54 --> 8074.42]  Yeah, do it
[8075.22 --> 8079.06]  That is so dumb okay, wait wait what
[8083.70 --> 8086.02]  So it's gonna be all ssd?
[8086.02 --> 8087.46]  We use both tanks
[8087.46 --> 8088.66]  It's all gonna be solid state
[8088.90 --> 8089.86]  Uh, well, no we could
[8089.86 --> 8092.90]  So you're gonna replace 80 terabytes of hard drives with solid state drives?
[8092.90 --> 8096.58]  No, no, we could use a PCIe riser out to an external hard drive enclosure
[8096.58 --> 8097.94]  What is the point?
[8098.66 --> 8099.86]  Oh my god
[8099.86 --> 8101.22]  The suffering is the point
[8104.42 --> 8104.98]  God
[8107.14 --> 8109.86]  People people no longer think you should do it
[8110.26 --> 8113.14]  Actually no float plane does float plane is ready
[8119.70 --> 8120.82]  Oh this is so dumb
[8120.82 --> 8123.54]  No, no, no, the NAS does not have to be mineral oil cooled
[8123.54 --> 8123.94]  Yeah
[8123.94 --> 8127.62]  But but we will expand the NAS to the point where
[8128.26 --> 8128.50]  What?
[8129.06 --> 8130.26]  Get more hard drives, what?
[8130.26 --> 8130.98]  It's full
[8130.98 --> 8132.18]  Yeah, yeah, whatever
[8132.18 --> 8132.98]  I mean, NAS is
[8132.98 --> 8133.46]  It's like, it's
[8133.46 --> 8135.86]  I don't have a dedicated like actually proper system for it
[8135.86 --> 8136.18]  That's fine
[8136.18 --> 8136.90]  It'll just include
[8136.90 --> 8137.94]  It's just the Synology NAS
[8137.94 --> 8138.74]  It'll include a NAS
[8139.22 --> 8140.26]  That's fine, that's fine
[8140.90 --> 8141.94]  So we will make sure
[8141.94 --> 8143.94]  We will make you whole in terms of storage
[8144.50 --> 8145.38]  That's my commitment
[8145.38 --> 8150.10]  Let me even see what the state of them are
[8150.10 --> 8150.26]  All right
[8150.26 --> 8151.22]  All right, all right
[8151.22 --> 8151.78]  All right
[8151.78 --> 8153.30]  Yeah, you don't have to make a decision now
[8153.30 --> 8154.02]  You can be a little
[8154.02 --> 8155.38]  Oh, I don't know
[8155.38 --> 8156.18]  I don't know about it
[8156.18 --> 8158.82]  Having a submersion cooled system again could be kind of cool
[8158.82 --> 8160.50]  I'm a little bit worried in an apartment
[8160.50 --> 8162.74]  If there's a leak, it could actually be like
[8163.94 --> 8164.82]  Super bad
[8164.82 --> 8166.74]  I mean, that sounds like a Luke problem to me
[8166.74 --> 8167.94]  Not a Linus problem
[8167.94 --> 8168.50]  So, you know
[8169.86 --> 8170.98]  Oh my goodness
[8171.62 --> 8171.94]  Wow
[8171.94 --> 8174.34]  We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
[8174.34 --> 8174.82]  I don't
[8174.82 --> 8176.66]  Again, I don't even know what tanks they are
[8176.66 --> 8178.82]  If it's genuinely just one ITX tank
[8178.82 --> 8179.94]  Because I'm pretty sure at least
[8179.94 --> 8182.02]  I think there's at least one ITX tank
[8182.02 --> 8183.38]  I think they're both ITX
[8183.38 --> 8184.42]  Is it two ITXs?
[8184.42 --> 8185.30]  I think it might be
[8185.30 --> 8186.50]  I honestly don't remember
[8186.50 --> 8189.14]  Basically, Puget gave us the last of their tanks
[8189.70 --> 8195.22]  And I think we used the last ATX one to do the last build we did
[8195.22 --> 8198.58]  Which we eventually like sold on Facebook Marketplace or something like that
[8198.58 --> 8201.22]  Because we were tired of just having it around and carrying it places
[8201.94 --> 8204.90]  And then I think you were like
[8204.90 --> 8206.82]  Can I just like have these ITX ones?
[8206.82 --> 8209.06]  And I was like, realistically, I'm never going to do anything with these
[8209.06 --> 8209.86]  Just take it and go
[8211.22 --> 8212.58]  I mean, he stole it, rather
[8212.58 --> 8213.70]  Is how that probably went down
[8214.58 --> 8217.94]  No, if I remember correctly, you like didn't know what to do with them
[8217.94 --> 8218.66]  Yeah, no, no
[8218.66 --> 8219.78]  And I was like, I'll take it
[8219.78 --> 8222.34]  I was just memeing with the whole stealing things from the office thing
[8222.90 --> 8224.66]  Yeah, yeah, so that's the deal
[8224.66 --> 8225.38]  I mean, there's some of that
[8225.38 --> 8226.74]  I was cleaning up, I found a few of those
[8226.74 --> 8232.98]  We're a lot more on top of that stuff now
[8232.98 --> 8235.78]  We have like a whole inventory system and asset tags and everything
[8235.78 --> 8240.66]  But things were a little more loosey-goosey when people were not being like paid well
[8242.18 --> 8243.94]  You know, it is what it is
[8244.82 --> 8246.34]  We made do with what we had
[8246.34 --> 8250.02]  There's a few things like I found a pair of headphones that I remember I got because
[8250.02 --> 8254.18]  Instead of like expensing a bunch of stuff, I just like got the headphones
[8254.18 --> 8254.82]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[8254.82 --> 8255.62]  There's like some stuff like that
[8255.62 --> 8257.30]  There was some loosey-goosey stuff
[8257.30 --> 8260.90]  I mean, another thing too is when we were a much smaller team
[8260.90 --> 8265.38]  If, you know, a Luke was just like, yeah, I need a new mouse
[8266.02 --> 8271.54]  I didn't have to worry about 98 other people coming to me and saying, well, what does Luke get a new mouse?
[8272.02 --> 8273.38]  It's a lot easier to deal with
[8273.38 --> 8274.02]  Yeah, there's so many
[8274.02 --> 8275.14]  Scale gets a little wacky
[8275.14 --> 8276.10]  Things you just like
[8276.82 --> 8280.02]  It really does come back to like grade school rules
[8280.02 --> 8281.70]  Did you bring enough for the whole class?
[8281.70 --> 8282.02]  No?
[8282.02 --> 8283.86]  Okay, well then you can't
[8283.86 --> 8284.74]  Then we can't
[8284.74 --> 8285.06]  Yeah
[8285.06 --> 8285.86]  That simple
[8285.86 --> 8286.10]  Yeah
[8286.66 --> 8287.06]  Um
[8287.06 --> 8288.34]  Yeah, if it's just ITX
[8289.06 --> 8291.06]  Cases, I honestly don't think I'm that
[8291.06 --> 8291.94]  I don't think I'm gonna do it
[8291.94 --> 8293.06]  You don't think you're gonna do it?
[8293.06 --> 8293.46]  Really?
[8293.46 --> 8294.58]  Not for just an ITX
[8295.30 --> 8297.46]  Well, yeah, but it'll be like top spec
[8297.70 --> 8298.42]  Top spec ITX
[8298.42 --> 8299.94]  Part of the problem is the volume of the tank
[8299.94 --> 8301.06]  Talk kek ITX
[8301.06 --> 8302.10]  Because they
[8302.10 --> 8304.10]  Even though you're potentially putting more in it
[8304.10 --> 8306.98]  I'd have to look at the properties of the new coolant
[8306.98 --> 8308.02]  Because I know it like exists
[8308.02 --> 8310.90]  But I haven't actually planned on doing a build in it
[8310.90 --> 8311.38]  Alright, alright
[8311.38 --> 8312.90]  I expect an answer next week
[8312.90 --> 8313.54]  Oh my goodness, okay
[8313.54 --> 8315.78]  The people expect an answer next week
[8315.78 --> 8317.78]  I'll talk to Jake
[8317.78 --> 8318.90]  I'm sure he knows
[8318.90 --> 8320.90]  He's more up on the current stats
[8322.90 --> 8324.10]  I don't even remember
[8324.10 --> 8324.90]  Was this a merch message?
[8324.90 --> 8325.62]  What is Luke getting oil PC?
[8325.62 --> 8328.50]  Linus and I have this agreement from ages ago
[8328.50 --> 8332.34]  Um, like pre-Linus Media Group
[8332.34 --> 8332.98]  Ages ago
[8332.98 --> 8337.54]  Um, back from when I was paid less than minimum wage
[8337.54 --> 8340.50]  Where he said he had like upgraded my system
[8341.22 --> 8343.54]  I got a 4080
[8345.54 --> 8346.50]  480 you mean?
[8346.50 --> 8347.38]  480, yeah, sorry
[8347.38 --> 8350.10]  A 480 and I don't remember what else was in there
[8350.10 --> 8354.58]  But it was like my first system upgrade after the Minerala system
[8354.58 --> 8355.78]  It was in an 800D
[8356.34 --> 8356.66]  Nice
[8356.66 --> 8358.10]  I got a 480
[8358.10 --> 8359.54]  I don't remember what processor it was
[8359.54 --> 8360.18]  Probably something D's
[8360.18 --> 8362.10]  I think it was like a 2600K or something
[8362.10 --> 8363.06]  It was like solid
[8363.06 --> 8364.98]  It was all like good stuff
[8364.98 --> 8365.46]  Yeah
[8365.46 --> 8366.98]  It was a big upgrade from what I had at the time
[8366.98 --> 8369.06]  Um, and then I was
[8369.06 --> 8370.58]  I don't remember how we got on the conversation
[8370.58 --> 8372.74]  But we were standing outside of the badminton center
[8372.74 --> 8374.10]  That you wanted to go to that night
[8374.10 --> 8375.38]  Because I needed a ride home
[8375.38 --> 8376.74]  And he wanted to play badminton first
[8376.74 --> 8378.02]  So I used to study
[8378.02 --> 8379.86]  I would study on the couch at his badminton center
[8379.86 --> 8381.38]  We didn't actually do that that many times
[8381.38 --> 8383.14]  I think that only happened a handful of times
[8383.14 --> 8384.34]  Yeah, I honestly didn't care
[8384.34 --> 8385.22]  I just needed to study
[8385.22 --> 8386.34]  And there was a place to study there
[8386.34 --> 8387.70]  So it honestly didn't make a difference to me
[8387.70 --> 8389.78]  I had my laptop and my textbooks anyways
[8389.78 --> 8390.34]  So like what
[8391.06 --> 8392.90]  It's basically the same thing as being at home
[8394.34 --> 8395.54]  And we had this conversation
[8395.54 --> 8396.34]  And he was basically like
[8396.34 --> 8397.46]  As long as you work with me
[8397.46 --> 8399.14]  I'll make sure that you have a good computer
[8399.14 --> 8399.54]  And I was like
[8399.54 --> 8400.58]  I'm holding you to that
[8400.58 --> 8403.14]  And now it's been 12 years or something
[8404.26 --> 8405.54]  And it's paying off
[8405.54 --> 8406.26]  Let's go
[8406.26 --> 8408.02]  Except now it might turn into an oil rig
[8408.02 --> 8410.42]  Which is concerning
[8410.42 --> 8410.90]  But we'll see
[8412.66 --> 8413.86]  And yes, Linus
[8413.86 --> 8414.90]  This was a merch message
[8414.90 --> 8415.30]  Okay
[8415.30 --> 8416.66]  A-Prime's all upset
[8416.66 --> 8417.06]  He's like
[8417.06 --> 8418.26]  Where's my oil PC?
[8419.14 --> 8419.78]  Come on
[8420.50 --> 8421.14]  Come on
[8421.14 --> 8422.66]  I have made no such agreement with you
[8422.66 --> 8422.90]  He says
[8422.90 --> 8423.94]  Screw that agreement
[8423.94 --> 8424.18]  Yeah
[8424.18 --> 8424.82]  Yeah
[8424.82 --> 8425.70]  Screw your agreement
[8425.70 --> 8428.58]  This was the worst part of Luke's house
[8428.58 --> 8430.18]  SS Thaum asks
[8430.18 --> 8432.58]  Any chance of a badminton match with Stephen He
[8432.58 --> 8435.38]  For a creator clash or a Dennis Fightlake thing?
[8435.38 --> 8436.34]  I really want it to happen
[8436.34 --> 8437.70]  So I'm posting this again
[8438.34 --> 8440.18]  Does Stephen even play badminton?
[8440.18 --> 8441.30]  Or are you profiling?
[8441.30 --> 8444.66]  Because I couldn't find any reference to him playing badminton at all
[8444.66 --> 8446.42]  I'm not putting up to a poll guys
[8446.42 --> 8449.54]  You guys don't actually get to like decide that I have to do this
[8450.26 --> 8451.22]  It's not happening
[8452.26 --> 8453.38]  Oh no
[8453.38 --> 8454.18]  All right
[8454.18 --> 8456.18]  What other topics do we want to talk about today?
[8456.18 --> 8458.34]  I also have to make sure it's like gonna be okay for the birds
[8459.30 --> 8460.26]  Yeah okay
[8460.26 --> 8460.98]  That should be fine
[8460.98 --> 8463.30]  Like there's certain things that I like actually have to go figure out
[8463.30 --> 8464.02]  That's fine
[8464.02 --> 8465.46]  And not everything is fine right?
[8465.46 --> 8468.50]  Because like there's certain chemicals in the environment that'll just kill them
[8468.50 --> 8471.30]  And it's like it might not be harmful to humans but it might be harmful to them
[8471.30 --> 8471.94]  Like there's
[8471.94 --> 8472.90]  I gotta figure stuff out
[8473.70 --> 8477.06]  Nokia hypes their super fixable phone
[8477.62 --> 8480.02]  I haven't gotten a chance to have a look at this yet
[8480.02 --> 8483.06]  But Pocket Lint has an article about this
[8483.06 --> 8483.94]  Let's go have a look
[8483.94 --> 8486.58]  It's pretty low spec
[8487.14 --> 8491.70]  Like I think describing it as entry level is definitely accurate
[8492.10 --> 8496.66]  I will say though that we're in an era of phones where I don't think that's actually going to bother that many people
[8497.30 --> 8497.78]  It's
[8497.78 --> 8499.14]  It's pretty low spec I just saw it
[8501.46 --> 8503.22]  Hoping for a little more than that
[8503.22 --> 8504.90]  Buddy immediately backtracks
[8505.54 --> 8507.38]  I got down to the display and hardware section
[8507.38 --> 8508.18]  I was just like ooh
[8508.98 --> 8510.58]  Recycled plastic rear
[8511.06 --> 8512.74]  IP52 protection
[8512.74 --> 8514.98]  Let's talk about the specs a little bit
[8514.98 --> 8516.10]  6.5 inch
[8516.10 --> 8518.42]  1600 by 720 pixels
[8518.42 --> 8519.94]  90 hertz refresh rate
[8519.94 --> 8520.58]  You know what?
[8521.38 --> 8523.38]  Is that a longer conversation here?
[8523.38 --> 8527.14]  Would you rather have 1080p at 60 hertz or 720p at 90?
[8527.14 --> 8531.30]  With how I currently use my phone
[8531.94 --> 8533.94]  Honestly, 720 at 90
[8533.94 --> 8534.34]  Really?
[8534.34 --> 8535.46]  Yeah, I think so
[8535.46 --> 8537.94]  Because it's almost all like text communication
[8537.94 --> 8539.06]  I don't, it doesn't need to be
[8539.46 --> 8540.34]  I don't care
[8540.34 --> 8540.58]  Yeah
[8541.46 --> 8542.34]  But it's not sharp
[8542.98 --> 8548.58]  Like 720, the difference between 720p and 1080 is a lot bigger than the difference between 1080 and 1440
[8548.58 --> 8549.78]  This is going to be a first world problem
[8549.78 --> 8552.34]  I haven't experienced 720 on a phone in a hot minute
[8552.34 --> 8553.06]  Yeah, it's
[8553.06 --> 8554.74]  So maybe I don't know
[8554.74 --> 8555.46]  Not great
[8555.46 --> 8555.94]  Yeah
[8555.94 --> 8560.66]  But the 90 hertz really does make things feel more responsive
[8560.66 --> 8562.58]  Even when you're dealing with slower hardware
[8562.58 --> 8564.34]  Usually, text communication on my phone
[8564.34 --> 8565.62]  I'm just trying to go fast
[8565.62 --> 8566.18]  Like
[8566.18 --> 8566.42]  Yeah
[8566.42 --> 8568.18]  Yeah, and it feels
[8568.18 --> 8570.66]  Feels better when you're typing
[8570.66 --> 8573.62]  Yeah, that's a tough one
[8573.62 --> 8575.22]  Anyway, sorry, you were telling the specs
[8575.22 --> 8584.26]  Yeah, unit SOC, T606, 4 gigs of RAM, 64 or 128 gigs of storage, plus a microSD slot
[8584.26 --> 8585.86]  Thank you
[8585.86 --> 8589.26]  What the heck is a T606? I'm looking this up
[8589.26 --> 8598.48]  Tiger T606 processor, entry-level octa-core SOC with two ARM A75s at up to
[8598.48 --> 8601.04]  Ooh, 1.6 gigahertz
[8601.04 --> 8601.36]  Woo
[8601.36 --> 8602.88]  Blazing speeds
[8602.88 --> 8607.58]  And six efficient A55 cores at up to 1.6
[8607.58 --> 8611.30]  That is not a fast chip
[8611.30 --> 8612.06]  Nope
[8612.06 --> 8613.36]  Okay, carry on
[8613.36 --> 8615.42]  5050 milliamp hour battery
[8615.42 --> 8616.50]  That's a big battery
[8616.50 --> 8618.52]  This thing will last for like three days on battery though
[8618.52 --> 8619.66]  20 watts charging
[8619.66 --> 8621.86]  Okay, that's fine
[8621.86 --> 8626.16]  It will take a while to charge that big battery at 20 watts though
[8626.16 --> 8627.22]  Um
[8627.22 --> 8629.70]  I don't really mind that
[8629.70 --> 8631.76]  If it's a huge battery, it takes long to charge
[8631.76 --> 8633.74]  I feel like it might just extend the life of it
[8633.74 --> 8636.14]  Because you're going to sit there with it plugged in 100% less often
[8636.14 --> 8638.82]  Yeah, I guess that's fair
[8638.82 --> 8642.00]  With my usage, I wouldn't mind that, personally
[8642.00 --> 8643.94]  I'm trying to find any sort of
[8643.94 --> 8645.78]  We deserve a pull, you deserve nothing
[8645.78 --> 8649.84]  I'm trying to find any insight into what exactly makes it repairable
[8649.84 --> 8651.24]  So some of the ease of repair
[8651.24 --> 8652.12]  Apparently
[8652.12 --> 8654.26]  Oh, oh, oh, here we go, here we go
[8654.26 --> 8657.22]  Uh, a new battery and all the tools
[8657.22 --> 8658.88]  Okay, I'm just going to read the thing
[8658.88 --> 8661.38]  So iFixit is partnering with Nokia
[8661.38 --> 8661.66]  Yeah
[8661.66 --> 8663.56]  On the creation of the G22
[8663.56 --> 8666.58]  This phone that is aiming for a price of $170
[8666.58 --> 8669.10]  Which is a lot more reasonable
[8669.10 --> 8671.08]  Uh, for the spec
[8671.08 --> 8673.72]  And compared to some of the other more open
[8673.72 --> 8676.92]  And repair-oriented phones that we've seen in the past
[8676.92 --> 8680.54]  It's designed to be easy to use and inexpensive to repair
[8680.54 --> 8683.56]  And iFixit will sell repair kits for the battery display rear panel
[8683.56 --> 8685.32]  And the USB-C module
[8685.32 --> 8688.34]  Which are four of the most common components to break in typical use
[8688.34 --> 8691.06]  And they will sell them for at least five years
[8691.06 --> 8691.82]  That's super cool
[8691.82 --> 8693.66]  But will it get software updates for five years?
[8694.52 --> 8694.76]  Hmm
[8694.76 --> 8697.62]  Uh, a new battery and all the tools to replace it
[8697.62 --> 8698.84]  Will cost you $30
[8698.84 --> 8702.16]  And it should take about 10 to 15 minutes
[8702.16 --> 8703.92]  For a typical user to complete the repair
[8703.92 --> 8707.08]  The most expensive part is apparently the touchscreen at $55
[8707.08 --> 8710.80]  By the time you're spending $55 on a touchscreen
[8710.80 --> 8712.96]  Couldn't it be $65 and be 1080p?
[8713.12 --> 8713.94]  I gotta kind of
[8713.94 --> 8715.96]  I gotta kind of wonder about that a little bit
[8715.96 --> 8716.18]  Yeah
[8716.18 --> 8716.52]  Um
[8716.52 --> 8719.26]  Some of the ease of repair comes from the fact
[8719.26 --> 8721.96]  That this is an inexpensive phone with inexpensive parts
[8721.96 --> 8725.20]  And that ease of disassembly has a direct trade-off
[8725.20 --> 8726.52]  With modern waterproofing measures
[8726.52 --> 8727.00]  However
[8727.00 --> 8730.46]  Nokia has genuinely eliminated several barriers
[8730.46 --> 8731.74]  To removing the back of the device
[8731.74 --> 8734.34]  And it retains its IP52 waterproof rating
[8734.34 --> 8736.48]  Even after the back has been replaced
[8736.48 --> 8739.10]  So IP52 is not watertight
[8739.10 --> 8741.40]  But it can take the odd accidental spray of water
[8741.40 --> 8743.56]  They're only providing three years
[8743.56 --> 8745.24]  Of security and operating system updates
[8745.24 --> 8746.90]  So even though you can get parts for five
[8746.90 --> 8748.20]  It's three years
[8748.20 --> 8750.06]  And I gotta imagine that three years is from
[8750.06 --> 8751.56]  Launch
[8751.56 --> 8752.02]  Yeah
[8752.02 --> 8753.92]  Not from when you buy it
[8753.92 --> 8755.66]  So not from when they stop selling it
[8755.66 --> 8756.62]  Um
[8756.62 --> 8761.50]  Man I'd love to see an actual compelling repairable phone
[8761.50 --> 8763.38]  Because on the one hand I want to look at this and go
[8763.38 --> 8763.98]  Progress
[8763.98 --> 8766.98]  But on the other hand I'm looking at it going
[8766.98 --> 8769.96]  This is like a half measure right?
[8770.14 --> 8770.22]  Yeah
[8770.22 --> 8770.82]  This is like
[8770.82 --> 8772.60]  Coming out and being like
[8772.60 --> 8773.80]  Um
[8773.80 --> 8774.30]  No but
[8774.30 --> 8775.72]  Yeah we made a repairable phone
[8775.72 --> 8776.52]  And nobody wanted it
[8776.52 --> 8778.90]  So clearly the market has chosen non-repairable phones
[8778.90 --> 8779.14]  No
[8779.14 --> 8780.00]  The market chose
[8780.00 --> 8781.94]  The only options that it actually has
[8781.94 --> 8783.38]  And I don't know that for a lot of people
[8783.38 --> 8785.18]  This is a truly viable option
[8785.18 --> 8786.40]  What
[8786.40 --> 8788.18]  What minimum spec
[8788.18 --> 8790.40]  Would it need to be
[8790.40 --> 8792.48]  For you to think it would be a viable option?
[8792.68 --> 8793.40]  Man you know
[8793.40 --> 8795.10]  I would have said something like Note 9
[8795.10 --> 8797.10]  But I've been using it lately
[8797.10 --> 8798.48]  Just to listen to
[8798.48 --> 8799.96]  Uh music when I'm
[8799.96 --> 8801.32]  Uh riding on my bike
[8801.32 --> 8802.76]  And
[8802.76 --> 8804.46]  Nah that's pretty slow
[8804.46 --> 8805.30]  It's
[8805.30 --> 8806.44]  It's slowed down
[8806.44 --> 8807.70]  Um
[8807.70 --> 8810.22]  I'd say
[8810.22 --> 8812.52]  There's some arguments that people might make about
[8812.52 --> 8814.62]  Planned obsolescence stuff
[8814.62 --> 8815.34]  Yeah
[8815.34 --> 8817.76]  That doesn't have to do with the actual speeds and feeds of the device
[8817.76 --> 8819.64]  But more has to do with like different certain updates
[8819.64 --> 8820.40]  That might actually
[8820.40 --> 8823.22]  Intentionally slow it down from the manufacturer side
[8823.22 --> 8826.56]  Ars Technica apparently ripped into it
[8826.56 --> 8828.66]  It's 39 steps to replace the screen
[8828.66 --> 8830.44]  See this is what I'm talking about
[8830.44 --> 8832.42]  Like that doesn't need to be the case
[8832.42 --> 8832.80]  I
[8832.80 --> 8833.14]  Yeah
[8833.14 --> 8835.18]  Why doesn't it just use screws?
[8836.52 --> 8837.34]  You need to hold the back
[8837.34 --> 8838.52]  Panel on
[8838.52 --> 8839.08]  Like why does
[8839.08 --> 8840.50]  Why does everything need to be clips
[8840.50 --> 8840.84]  And
[8840.84 --> 8841.84]  And clips and glue
[8841.84 --> 8842.14]  And
[8842.14 --> 8844.44]  I don't remember what your question was
[8844.44 --> 8844.80]  I'm sorry
[8844.80 --> 8845.72]  What would
[8845.72 --> 8846.66]  Oh right
[8846.66 --> 8848.70]  I would say if it's
[8848.70 --> 8849.76]  Three year old
[8849.76 --> 8851.24]  Flagship tier performance
[8851.24 --> 8853.48]  I would consider that to be more than acceptable
[8853.48 --> 8855.12]  But I feel like
[8855.12 --> 8858.14]  Phones like computers
[8858.14 --> 8859.66]  Have gotten to the point where
[8859.66 --> 8860.24]  A
[8860.24 --> 8862.28]  The improvements
[8862.28 --> 8863.46]  Generation over generation
[8863.46 --> 8864.80]  Are not that big anymore
[8864.80 --> 8865.44]  Meaning that
[8865.44 --> 8867.98]  You can use three year old hardware
[8867.98 --> 8869.60]  You know really really easily
[8869.60 --> 8871.34]  And have a really great experience with it
[8871.34 --> 8872.38]  But also B
[8872.38 --> 8874.68]  It means that the value of that three year old hardware
[8874.68 --> 8875.90]  Isn't dropping the way it used to
[8875.90 --> 8876.22]  Yeah
[8876.22 --> 8878.48]  Like you look at the way PC hardware is
[8878.48 --> 8879.70]  Plummeting right now
[8879.70 --> 8881.02]  Generation over generation
[8881.02 --> 8881.96]  In terms of
[8881.96 --> 8882.34]  Of price
[8882.34 --> 8884.32]  Like you can get Ryzen 2000 stuff on eBay
[8884.32 --> 8885.22]  For like nothing
[8885.22 --> 8886.46]  Ryzen 3000
[8886.46 --> 8887.48]  Very reasonable
[8887.48 --> 8891.20]  For a long time there
[8891.20 --> 8892.30]  When Intel was releasing
[8892.30 --> 8893.58]  Quad core after quad core
[8893.58 --> 8894.44]  After quad core
[8894.44 --> 8896.68]  You know the 7700k comes out
[8896.68 --> 8898.92]  And 4770ks are like
[8898.92 --> 8901.20]  $10 cheaper on eBay
[8901.20 --> 8902.28]  You know
[8902.28 --> 8904.28]  3770ks are maybe
[8904.28 --> 8905.74]  $25 cheaper on eBay
[8905.74 --> 8907.04]  And I feel like we're seeing that with phones
[8907.04 --> 8907.26]  Right
[8907.26 --> 8908.58]  Like they're not dropping in value
[8908.58 --> 8909.34]  Quite as fast
[8909.34 --> 8909.56]  Yeah
[8909.56 --> 8910.06]  Within
[8910.06 --> 8911.86]  The software update period
[8911.86 --> 8913.70]  Because that's a different kind of obsolescence
[8913.70 --> 8915.70]  I like basically didn't even realize
[8915.70 --> 8916.88]  How old my phone was
[8916.88 --> 8917.22]  Yeah
[8917.22 --> 8918.56]  I only thought about it recently
[8918.56 --> 8919.32]  But like I don't
[8919.32 --> 8921.02]  It doesn't affect me
[8921.02 --> 8922.04]  The battery is still in
[8922.04 --> 8923.10]  Okay enough state
[8923.10 --> 8923.76]  That it lasts
[8923.76 --> 8924.46]  A day
[8924.46 --> 8925.98]  So I just charge it at night
[8925.98 --> 8926.64]  Whatever
[8926.64 --> 8928.28]  It's not the most efficient way
[8928.28 --> 8929.28]  Because it hits 100%
[8929.28 --> 8930.20]  And sits there for a bit
[8930.20 --> 8930.80]  And stuff like that
[8930.80 --> 8931.38]  But it's old
[8931.38 --> 8932.88]  I'm not that worried about it at this point
[8932.88 --> 8934.08]  Stuff like that
[8934.08 --> 8936.12]  But like
[8936.12 --> 8936.90]  It's fine
[8936.90 --> 8938.54]  Yeah
[8938.54 --> 8939.36]  I have some problems
[8939.36 --> 8940.46]  It had a lot more problems
[8940.46 --> 8941.34]  When I first got it
[8941.34 --> 8942.94]  But it received software updates
[8942.94 --> 8944.12]  And it fixed a lot of those problems
[8944.12 --> 8945.32]  And now it's just like
[8945.32 --> 8945.90]  I don't know
[8945.90 --> 8946.98]  I used what
[8946.98 --> 8948.26]  Like Slack, Teams, and Discord
[8948.26 --> 8950.56]  That's like 90% of what I'm doing on it
[8950.56 --> 8951.98]  The rest of it is like
[8951.98 --> 8953.22]  Reading news or whatever
[8953.22 --> 8953.56]  Yeah
[8953.56 --> 8955.46]  Like it doesn't need to be super powerful
[8955.46 --> 8956.76]  For my use case
[8956.76 --> 8958.34]  Sure maybe some other people
[8958.34 --> 8959.60]  Are doing more complicated things with phones
[8959.60 --> 8961.38]  But not me
[8961.38 --> 8963.04]  So I don't really care that much
[8963.04 --> 8963.54]  But
[8963.54 --> 8965.64]  I do like
[8965.64 --> 8966.76]  Get really frustrated
[8966.76 --> 8968.28]  The second it like slows down
[8968.28 --> 8969.76]  Because I'm very often
[8969.76 --> 8971.42]  Trying to do quick tasks
[8971.42 --> 8972.60]  Since when a message
[8972.60 --> 8973.46]  Reply to something really quick
[8973.46 --> 8973.64]  Yeah
[8973.64 --> 8975.66]  And if it like
[8975.66 --> 8977.10]  Chugs while doing that
[8977.10 --> 8977.96]  I do get frustrated
[8977.96 --> 8978.64]  So there is like
[8978.64 --> 8979.90]  A minimum level of performance
[8979.90 --> 8980.38]  Yeah
[8980.38 --> 8981.40]  That I want it to be
[8981.40 --> 8982.50]  I doubt that this would
[8982.50 --> 8983.98]  Be satisfactory
[8983.98 --> 8984.98]  And I think this is too low
[8984.98 --> 8985.34]  Yeah
[8985.34 --> 8985.62]  Yeah
[8985.62 --> 8986.12]  Yeah
[8986.12 --> 8989.10]  Well that's a bummer
[8989.10 --> 8989.84]  Yeah
[8989.84 --> 8990.78]  Is there anything else
[8990.78 --> 8992.08]  That's critical for us to
[8992.08 --> 8992.36]  Oh
[8992.36 --> 8993.30]  Oh announcements
[8993.30 --> 8996.02]  I have a mock-up
[8996.02 --> 8996.60]  Oh
[8996.60 --> 8997.94]  For the screwdriver holster
[8997.94 --> 8998.98]  Yes
[8998.98 --> 9001.70]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[9001.70 --> 9005.14]  Where's the loop?
[9006.10 --> 9007.58]  Is it like a belt loop thing?
[9007.72 --> 9009.02]  So it's like a
[9009.02 --> 9010.26]  It's like a
[9010.26 --> 9010.86]  Like a click
[9010.86 --> 9011.66]  Like a
[9011.66 --> 9012.30]  It's like a hinge
[9012.30 --> 9012.76]  Oh okay
[9012.76 --> 9013.14]  Yeah
[9013.14 --> 9014.18]  And then
[9014.18 --> 9014.94]  It
[9014.94 --> 9015.48]  It
[9015.48 --> 9016.96]  It has like a clicky thing
[9016.96 --> 9018.08]  So you can adjust the angle
[9018.08 --> 9019.24]  Oh that's kind of neat
[9019.24 --> 9019.96]  So if you want it to
[9019.96 --> 9021.10]  Kind of more face forward
[9021.10 --> 9022.70]  For a crossbody draw
[9022.70 --> 9023.78]  Or if you want it more like
[9023.78 --> 9024.72]  Yeah you can change your draw
[9024.72 --> 9027.24]  That's amazing
[9027.24 --> 9028.54]  I have been warned
[9028.54 --> 9030.92]  That if we go hand stitched
[9030.92 --> 9032.70]  This thing could cost like
[9032.70 --> 9034.82]  A hundred or even two hundred dollars
[9034.82 --> 9037.82]  But the advantage of hand stitching
[9037.82 --> 9039.28]  Is that if a stitch breaks
[9039.28 --> 9041.18]  The whole thing doesn't come apart
[9041.18 --> 9042.84]  So like machine stitching
[9042.84 --> 9043.78]  For leather
[9043.78 --> 9045.40]  Is it leather?
[9045.50 --> 9046.24]  It's just black leather?
[9046.42 --> 9047.10]  It'll be leather
[9047.10 --> 9048.26]  We're gonna go
[9048.26 --> 9049.48]  We're gonna go full grain
[9049.48 --> 9050.08]  Like
[9050.08 --> 9051.38]  And
[9051.38 --> 9052.86]  And if we get it hand stitched
[9052.86 --> 9054.00]  It'll probably have to be made
[9054.00 --> 9054.68]  In North America
[9054.68 --> 9056.38]  So this thing could be
[9056.38 --> 9057.68]  Extremely expensive
[9057.68 --> 9061.06]  I don't know if this is gonna be
[9061.06 --> 9062.00]  A viable product
[9062.00 --> 9063.40]  But this is the
[9063.40 --> 9065.86]  This is the initial design
[9065.86 --> 9067.10]  The cut out here
[9067.10 --> 9068.18]  Is so that you can pop
[9068.18 --> 9069.46]  The screwdriver up from the bottom
[9069.46 --> 9070.54]  To make it easier to grab
[9070.54 --> 9071.80]  From the top
[9071.80 --> 9072.64]  Oh wow nice
[9072.64 --> 9073.64]  Yeah so you kind of pop it up
[9073.64 --> 9074.02]  And then yeah
[9074.02 --> 9075.36]  Obviously that's a snap
[9075.36 --> 9075.78]  Yeah
[9075.78 --> 9076.56]  And I told the team
[9076.56 --> 9077.00]  I was like
[9077.00 --> 9078.98]  I want the snappiest snap
[9078.98 --> 9080.84]  Like just like
[9080.84 --> 9082.16]  I want it to be ridiculous
[9082.16 --> 9082.90]  You know what I mean?
[9083.26 --> 9083.48]  Yeah
[9083.48 --> 9085.14]  I think it should be silver actually
[9085.14 --> 9085.48]  I'm gonna
[9085.48 --> 9086.62]  I'll talk to Matthew about it
[9086.62 --> 9087.42]  Yeah he's the one
[9087.42 --> 9087.94]  It'll be
[9087.94 --> 9089.04]  It'll
[9089.04 --> 9089.46]  It'll
[9089.46 --> 9091.60]  If
[9091.60 --> 9092.96]  We can find
[9092.96 --> 9095.34]  An alternative leather
[9095.34 --> 9096.24]  That is
[9096.24 --> 9097.82]  Just as strong
[9097.82 --> 9098.32]  And durable
[9098.32 --> 9099.80]  We will
[9099.80 --> 9101.34]  Consider an alternative leather
[9101.34 --> 9103.00]  But right now
[9103.00 --> 9103.58]  I can
[9103.58 --> 9104.32]  I
[9104.32 --> 9105.60]  I think it's probably
[9105.60 --> 9106.58]  Going to be
[9106.58 --> 9108.00]  Cow
[9108.00 --> 9108.92]  Cow
[9108.92 --> 9111.76]  Outer
[9111.76 --> 9114.10]  Layer
[9114.10 --> 9117.56]  That sounds worse
[9117.56 --> 9118.54]  I think it's going to be
[9118.54 --> 9119.10]  Cow cow
[9119.10 --> 9121.50]  It's not that I hate cows
[9121.50 --> 9122.96]  I do hate cows
[9122.96 --> 9123.90]  But that's not why
[9123.90 --> 9125.10]  It's just that
[9125.10 --> 9126.16]  Leather is
[9126.16 --> 9127.44]  You know
[9127.44 --> 9128.42]  It's leather man
[9128.42 --> 9129.92]  Someone said brass
[9129.92 --> 9130.84]  For the button
[9130.84 --> 9132.12]  Ooh I don't know
[9132.12 --> 9133.54]  I'd want to match the finish
[9133.54 --> 9133.98]  Of the
[9133.98 --> 9134.88]  Of the silver shaft
[9134.88 --> 9135.58]  Yeah so I was
[9135.58 --> 9135.98]  I was
[9135.98 --> 9136.42]  Yeah
[9136.42 --> 9137.02]  Sounding
[9137.02 --> 9138.92]  Listening to the cost
[9138.92 --> 9140.02]  I don't think this is really viable
[9140.02 --> 9141.24]  But releasing one
[9141.24 --> 9142.34]  That was black
[9142.34 --> 9143.44]  And releasing one that was silver
[9143.44 --> 9143.84]  Yeah no
[9143.84 --> 9144.66]  There'll be one version
[9144.66 --> 9146.28]  Would have been pretty sick
[9146.28 --> 9147.70]  For people that got the black shaft
[9147.70 --> 9148.18]  Screwdrivers
[9148.18 --> 9148.88]  But yeah
[9148.88 --> 9149.90]  The costing and stuff
[9149.90 --> 9150.90]  You're only gonna have one version
[9150.90 --> 9153.54]  I think it's gonna be a low volume
[9153.54 --> 9154.10]  And hey
[9154.10 --> 9155.14]  The people with the black shaft
[9155.14 --> 9155.56]  Screwdrivers
[9155.56 --> 9156.58]  They'll be silver eventually
[9156.58 --> 9157.92]  It's possible
[9157.92 --> 9160.04]  It's true what he says
[9160.04 --> 9161.32]  It's possible
[9161.32 --> 9162.46]  That the
[9162.46 --> 9163.46]  It's possible
[9163.46 --> 9165.06]  That the machine stitching
[9165.06 --> 9166.10]  Will you know
[9166.10 --> 9167.34]  Will find a place
[9167.34 --> 9167.86]  That you know
[9167.86 --> 9168.58]  The quality is like
[9168.58 --> 9169.38]  Really good or whatever
[9169.38 --> 9171.24]  But it seems quite likely
[9171.24 --> 9171.86]  Right now
[9171.86 --> 9172.86]  That it's gonna end up
[9172.86 --> 9173.76]  Being hand stitched
[9173.76 --> 9174.44]  And that means
[9174.44 --> 9175.10]  It'll end up being
[9175.10 --> 9176.44]  Probably very expensive
[9176.44 --> 9178.14]  Not because we're gouging
[9178.14 --> 9178.78]  But because we
[9178.78 --> 9179.68]  Unapologetically
[9179.68 --> 9181.20]  Are just going to make
[9181.20 --> 9182.24]  The best products we can
[9182.24 --> 9183.52]  And if you don't like it
[9183.52 --> 9185.36]  Then you don't have to buy them
[9185.36 --> 9187.12]  You can see a lot of people
[9187.12 --> 9188.62]  Are into the philosophy
[9188.62 --> 9189.64]  And
[9189.64 --> 9189.84]  Yeah
[9189.84 --> 9190.76]  Thanks Matthew L
[9190.76 --> 9191.64]  Are
[9191.64 --> 9193.46]  Really enjoying the tech pouch
[9193.46 --> 9194.38]  I've been kind of
[9194.38 --> 9195.38]  Keeping my eye on it
[9195.38 --> 9197.14]  A lot of people
[9197.14 --> 9198.10]  Are into the tech pouch
[9198.10 --> 9199.32]  I'll say that much
[9199.32 --> 9199.72]  Yeah
[9199.72 --> 9200.02]  Hell yeah
[9200.02 --> 9201.44]  Yeah it's been a bit of a day
[9201.44 --> 9201.98]  For the store
[9201.98 --> 9203.56]  It is not the cheapest way
[9203.56 --> 9204.46]  That you can have a bag
[9204.46 --> 9205.18]  Of said size
[9205.18 --> 9205.60]  Nope
[9205.60 --> 9207.02]  Not even a little
[9207.02 --> 9208.00]  But it's really good
[9208.00 --> 9208.34]  Yeah
[9208.34 --> 9209.62]  There you go
[9209.62 --> 9211.58]  Can we create a poll
[9211.58 --> 9212.36]  Yes
[9212.36 --> 9213.84]  We want to figure out
[9213.84 --> 9214.74]  How much of the total
[9214.74 --> 9215.52]  Addressable market
[9215.52 --> 9217.76]  For lower body
[9217.76 --> 9218.56]  Undergarments
[9218.56 --> 9219.76]  We're missing out on
[9219.76 --> 9220.60]  By only having
[9220.60 --> 9221.42]  Boxer briefs
[9221.42 --> 9222.94]  So is this question
[9222.94 --> 9224.50]  What is your favorite
[9224.50 --> 9224.94]  Yeah
[9224.94 --> 9226.04]  What's your preference
[9226.04 --> 9229.08]  Boxers or briefs
[9229.08 --> 9230.08]  Or boxer briefs
[9230.08 --> 9232.54]  So Luke's gonna create a poll
[9232.54 --> 9233.56]  And hit up float plane
[9233.56 --> 9236.06]  And I will move on
[9236.06 --> 9236.88]  To the next topic
[9236.88 --> 9238.28]  What we currently have
[9238.28 --> 9239.18]  Is boxer briefs
[9239.18 --> 9239.36]  Correct
[9239.36 --> 9239.70]  Yes
[9239.70 --> 9242.20]  Ford is
[9242.20 --> 9243.50]  This is awful
[9243.50 --> 9245.16]  Ford is seeking a patent
[9245.16 --> 9246.36]  For a new system
[9246.36 --> 9247.10]  That would allow them
[9247.10 --> 9248.00]  To gradually
[9248.00 --> 9249.40]  Shut off features
[9249.40 --> 9251.78]  In delinquent customers
[9251.78 --> 9252.38]  Cars
[9252.38 --> 9255.58]  Like seat controls
[9255.58 --> 9257.40]  Automatic locking
[9257.40 --> 9258.66]  And windows
[9258.66 --> 9260.44]  As well as air conditioning
[9260.44 --> 9262.14]  And the infotainment system
[9262.14 --> 9264.56]  After enough missed payments
[9264.56 --> 9265.80]  The car would simply
[9265.80 --> 9267.06]  Drive itself away
[9267.06 --> 9270.96]  Is this the most dystopian
[9270.96 --> 9271.74]  Timeline Luke
[9271.74 --> 9273.82]  Yeah it also sounds like
[9273.82 --> 9276.28]  So ripe for abuse
[9276.28 --> 9277.00]  And hacking
[9277.00 --> 9277.70]  I mean seat controls
[9277.70 --> 9279.72]  You could make a very strong
[9279.72 --> 9281.44]  Argument for how dangerous
[9281.44 --> 9283.44]  Having an improperly
[9283.44 --> 9284.44]  Adjusted seat could be
[9284.44 --> 9285.60]  If you're sitting too close
[9285.60 --> 9287.60]  Or too far from the steering wheel
[9287.60 --> 9289.58]  That could be a life or death issue
[9289.58 --> 9290.74]  I mean honestly
[9290.74 --> 9294.52]  You could say that about almost anything
[9294.52 --> 9295.82]  Automatic locking
[9295.82 --> 9296.90]  Yeah so
[9296.90 --> 9297.84]  Okay
[9297.84 --> 9298.54]  Man
[9298.54 --> 9299.60]  My aunt
[9299.60 --> 9301.18]  Had the wildest experience
[9301.18 --> 9301.96]  Downtown Vancouver
[9301.96 --> 9303.34]  She's just driving
[9303.34 --> 9305.06]  And someone tries to get into
[9305.06 --> 9305.96]  Some lady just like
[9305.96 --> 9306.64]  Got in her car
[9306.64 --> 9307.16]  Yeah
[9307.16 --> 9307.80]  Like hey
[9307.80 --> 9308.96]  I need a ride to here
[9308.96 --> 9310.20]  And you don't know
[9310.20 --> 9311.46]  Do they have a knife
[9311.46 --> 9312.76]  Do they have a gun
[9312.76 --> 9314.12]  Do they have a
[9314.12 --> 9316.26]  A syringe full of AIDS
[9316.26 --> 9317.42]  Like you don't know
[9317.42 --> 9318.24]  You don't know
[9318.24 --> 9318.80]  What they
[9318.80 --> 9319.76]  They have
[9319.76 --> 9320.44]  But just
[9320.44 --> 9321.50]  Just got in the car
[9321.50 --> 9323.20]  And she was terrified
[9323.20 --> 9323.76]  Yeah
[9323.76 --> 9324.60]  As it turned out
[9324.60 --> 9326.36]  She drove her where she needed to go
[9326.36 --> 9327.22]  And she like got out
[9327.22 --> 9327.86]  And left
[9327.86 --> 9329.48]  Which is like
[9329.48 --> 9330.32]  Lucky right
[9330.32 --> 9330.76]  Yeah
[9330.76 --> 9331.16]  But
[9331.16 --> 9333.06]  So someone's automatic locking
[9333.06 --> 9333.86]  Is not working
[9333.86 --> 9334.44]  And then
[9334.44 --> 9335.72]  And that happens
[9335.72 --> 9336.44]  Who's liable
[9336.44 --> 9337.22]  Yeah
[9337.22 --> 9338.82]  Does Ford just basically go
[9338.82 --> 9341.06]  Well you should have made your payments
[9341.06 --> 9341.62]  And
[9341.62 --> 9342.88]  You know
[9342.88 --> 9343.98]  Fair enough right
[9343.98 --> 9345.04]  There's no free luncheon
[9345.04 --> 9345.84]  In this life
[9345.84 --> 9346.98]  If you don't pay for something
[9346.98 --> 9348.02]  You are effectively
[9348.02 --> 9349.64]  You have stolen it
[9349.64 --> 9351.30]  And it is
[9351.30 --> 9352.56]  It is now Ford's property
[9352.56 --> 9353.36]  And not yours
[9353.36 --> 9354.34]  But holy
[9354.34 --> 9356.74]  Like it can't go down like this
[9356.74 --> 9358.04]  And like
[9358.04 --> 9360.10]  The ability
[9360.10 --> 9361.56]  For someone to just
[9361.56 --> 9362.84]  Steal your car
[9362.84 --> 9365.86]  By
[9365.86 --> 9366.62]  By
[9366.62 --> 9366.66]  By
[9366.66 --> 9368.02]  I mean
[9368.02 --> 9369.04]  We talk about
[9369.04 --> 9370.28]  Vulnerabilities in cars
[9370.28 --> 9371.34]  All the time
[9371.34 --> 9372.20]  We talked about
[9372.20 --> 9373.28]  Vulnerabilities in Kias
[9373.28 --> 9373.88]  The other day
[9373.88 --> 9375.12]  Where people could just
[9375.12 --> 9376.44]  Steal them willy nilly
[9376.44 --> 9377.16]  And it took
[9377.16 --> 9377.80]  An actual
[9377.80 --> 9379.60]  Extreme amount of exposure
[9379.60 --> 9381.06]  To get them to do anything about it
[9381.06 --> 9382.50]  I think it was Kia and Hyundai
[9382.50 --> 9383.22]  I think it was both
[9383.22 --> 9386.22]  You think this is gonna
[9386.22 --> 9387.36]  Stay secure forever?
[9387.36 --> 9390.10]  What about in 10 years
[9390.10 --> 9391.38]  When this car is still on the road?
[9391.92 --> 9392.06]  Yeah
[9392.06 --> 9393.20]  What about in 15 years
[9393.20 --> 9394.02]  When the car is potentially
[9394.02 --> 9394.66]  Still on the road?
[9395.24 --> 9396.60]  That's something I really worry about
[9396.60 --> 9397.14]  With Tesla
[9397.14 --> 9399.74]  They have so many different revs
[9399.74 --> 9400.66]  Of their cars
[9400.66 --> 9402.24]  Like they don't have model years
[9402.24 --> 9404.52]  The way that traditional car companies
[9404.52 --> 9405.46]  Have model years
[9405.46 --> 9407.80]  What is going to happen
[9407.80 --> 9409.58]  When they don't feel
[9409.58 --> 9411.30]  Like dealing with the
[9411.30 --> 9413.42]  With the software baggage
[9413.42 --> 9416.24]  Of all those
[9416.24 --> 9417.50]  Model 3's with LiDAR
[9417.50 --> 9419.58]  That like
[9419.58 --> 9421.24]  Don't have as good of a camera system
[9421.24 --> 9422.06]  And like
[9422.06 --> 9424.26]  Used supplementary LiDAR
[9424.26 --> 9424.92]  And ugh
[9424.92 --> 9425.50]  What a pain
[9425.50 --> 9428.06]  Or anything
[9428.06 --> 9429.20]  I just
[9429.20 --> 9431.52]  Ugh
[9431.52 --> 9432.28]  Yeah
[9432.28 --> 9433.90]  I worry a lot about that
[9433.90 --> 9435.46]  And it's a really good point
[9435.46 --> 9435.72]  Like
[9435.72 --> 9439.18]  The automotive industry
[9439.18 --> 9440.06]  In general
[9440.06 --> 9440.90]  And to their credit
[9440.90 --> 9441.50]  Tesla has
[9441.50 --> 9443.58]  Probably the best reputation
[9443.58 --> 9444.32]  Out of all of them
[9444.32 --> 9445.88]  But the automotive industry
[9445.88 --> 9446.54]  In general
[9446.54 --> 9447.52]  Is
[9447.52 --> 9448.58]  Terrible
[9448.58 --> 9449.00]  Oh yeah
[9449.00 --> 9449.96]  When it comes to
[9449.96 --> 9451.16]  Maintaining software
[9451.16 --> 9452.00]  So anything
[9452.00 --> 9453.22]  Where I have to trust them
[9453.22 --> 9454.62]  To do anything
[9454.62 --> 9455.50]  Post purchase
[9455.50 --> 9457.32]  Yeah
[9457.32 --> 9457.68]  I just
[9457.68 --> 9459.34]  I write it off
[9459.34 --> 9460.66]  It doesn't exist to me
[9460.66 --> 9461.90]  Potentially take your car back
[9461.90 --> 9462.46]  Remotely
[9462.46 --> 9462.82]  Yeah
[9462.82 --> 9463.92]  So that's not cool
[9463.92 --> 9466.00]  The technology to do this
[9466.00 --> 9467.52]  Has yet to be developed
[9467.52 --> 9467.96]  Apparently
[9467.96 --> 9469.26]  But it is at least
[9469.26 --> 9470.64]  Theoretically possible
[9470.64 --> 9471.74]  Given the current trajectory
[9471.74 --> 9472.66]  Of self-driving cars
[9472.66 --> 9473.66]  And a few days after
[9473.66 --> 9474.54]  This patent was filed
[9474.54 --> 9475.16]  By Ford
[9475.16 --> 9476.00]  They announced
[9476.00 --> 9476.98]  The creation of a
[9476.98 --> 9477.94]  Semi-autonomous driving
[9477.94 --> 9478.56]  Subsidiary
[9478.56 --> 9479.30]  Within the company
[9479.30 --> 9481.46]  The idea is not
[9481.46 --> 9482.24]  Entirely new
[9482.24 --> 9483.22]  In some places
[9483.22 --> 9484.22]  It is legal
[9484.22 --> 9484.92]  For dealerships
[9484.92 --> 9486.22]  To install remote systems
[9486.22 --> 9487.64]  That beep incessantly
[9487.64 --> 9488.40]  Or even
[9488.40 --> 9489.82]  Kill-switch the car
[9489.82 --> 9491.30]  From customers
[9491.30 --> 9492.18]  Who are using credit
[9492.18 --> 9492.64]  In the event
[9492.64 --> 9493.42]  That they don't pay
[9493.42 --> 9495.76]  Our discussion question is
[9495.76 --> 9496.86]  What is the likely consequence
[9496.86 --> 9498.14]  Of having these sorts of back doors
[9498.14 --> 9498.78]  I think we've kind of
[9498.78 --> 9499.48]  Gone through it
[9499.48 --> 9500.92]  Luke and I
[9500.92 --> 9502.32]  Are not in favor of this
[9502.32 --> 9503.46]  I think it's pretty fair to say
[9503.46 --> 9503.94]  Yeah
[9503.94 --> 9504.66]  This is
[9504.66 --> 9505.78]  It's dystopian
[9505.78 --> 9506.74]  It's dystopian
[9506.74 --> 9508.24]  And I'm not using that word
[9508.24 --> 9509.96]  Lightly
[9509.96 --> 9511.26]  It is
[9511.26 --> 9512.86]  This is it
[9512.86 --> 9514.80]  Also a car related topic
[9514.80 --> 9516.02]  Streamer
[9516.02 --> 9517.04]  Has van stolen
[9517.04 --> 9518.06]  The internet
[9518.06 --> 9519.06]  Gets it back
[9519.06 --> 9520.32]  Our source
[9520.32 --> 9520.80]  Is
[9520.80 --> 9521.72]  Ludwig
[9521.72 --> 9524.16]  This guy
[9524.16 --> 9524.78]  Yep
[9524.78 --> 9525.84]  What great hair
[9525.84 --> 9526.62]  You know
[9526.62 --> 9527.18]  Fantastic
[9527.18 --> 9527.90]  Like that's not fair
[9527.90 --> 9528.58]  To other people
[9528.58 --> 9529.90]  To have hair that good
[9529.90 --> 9531.14]  Anyway
[9531.14 --> 9533.06]  Two days ago
[9533.06 --> 9534.14]  Ludwig announced
[9534.14 --> 9535.18]  That his prized
[9535.18 --> 9536.06]  1997
[9536.06 --> 9536.80]  Subaru
[9536.80 --> 9537.58]  Sambar
[9537.58 --> 9538.48]  Microvan
[9538.48 --> 9539.30]  Had been stolen
[9539.30 --> 9540.26]  From outside the warehouse
[9540.26 --> 9540.82]  Where he films
[9540.82 --> 9541.54]  After a storm
[9541.54 --> 9542.24]  Knocked out the power
[9542.24 --> 9543.16]  To the electric gate
[9543.16 --> 9544.48]  Ludwig's assistant
[9544.48 --> 9545.48]  And a collaborator
[9545.48 --> 9546.68]  Managed to track down
[9546.68 --> 9547.72]  The van that evening
[9547.72 --> 9549.24]  Unable to acquire
[9549.24 --> 9549.90]  Police assistance
[9549.90 --> 9550.96]  They entered the van
[9550.96 --> 9552.02]  Only to find someone
[9552.02 --> 9552.50]  In it
[9552.50 --> 9554.28]  The man seemed confused
[9554.28 --> 9555.10]  And told them
[9555.10 --> 9556.04]  He didn't steal it
[9556.04 --> 9557.30]  But was given it
[9557.30 --> 9557.86]  By someone
[9557.86 --> 9558.90]  Who owed him money
[9558.90 --> 9560.34]  He then offered
[9560.34 --> 9561.24]  To return the van
[9561.24 --> 9562.14]  If they gave him
[9562.14 --> 9563.00]  $10,000
[9563.00 --> 9565.14]  After they decided
[9565.14 --> 9566.44]  To call the police again
[9566.44 --> 9567.38]  Which it's not even worth
[9567.38 --> 9567.88]  By the way
[9567.88 --> 9568.06]  Yeah
[9568.06 --> 9569.26]  We'll try that route
[9569.26 --> 9570.68]  The guy took off
[9570.68 --> 9571.30]  In the van
[9571.30 --> 9573.10]  At some point
[9573.10 --> 9574.62]  He drove it to a massage parlor
[9574.62 --> 9575.42]  Where it was spied
[9575.42 --> 9576.54]  By a Reddit user
[9576.54 --> 9577.94]  Who had heard of the theft
[9577.94 --> 9579.80]  The police finally showed up
[9579.80 --> 9581.54]  And the driver fled on foot
[9581.54 --> 9582.30]  Allowing the van
[9582.30 --> 9582.98]  To be recovered
[9582.98 --> 9586.02]  Our discussion question here
[9586.02 --> 9587.12]  Is that
[9587.12 --> 9589.14]  The Reddit
[9589.14 --> 9590.44]  Has been obsessed
[9590.44 --> 9591.44]  With my new car
[9591.44 --> 9592.68]  And
[9592.68 --> 9593.74]  Maybe
[9593.74 --> 9595.44]  It's a positive thing
[9595.44 --> 9596.08]  It's a good thing
[9596.08 --> 9597.40]  Yeah
[9597.40 --> 9598.40]  They gotta know everything
[9598.40 --> 9598.92]  Because then you have
[9598.92 --> 9599.64]  A little army
[9599.64 --> 9600.32]  That you guys
[9600.32 --> 9601.12]  Know what
[9601.12 --> 9602.12]  You guys know
[9602.12 --> 9603.20]  What car I drive
[9603.20 --> 9604.18]  So that in the event
[9604.18 --> 9604.94]  That it gets stolen
[9604.94 --> 9606.36]  You can help me recover it
[9606.36 --> 9609.08]  So I've been kind of
[9609.08 --> 9610.24]  Easing into it
[9610.24 --> 9611.74]  As some of you have noticed
[9611.74 --> 9612.26]  No it
[9612.26 --> 9613.76]  It was never a leak
[9613.76 --> 9615.02]  Every time
[9615.02 --> 9616.24]  There were glimpses of it
[9616.24 --> 9616.58]  Or whatever
[9616.58 --> 9617.26]  It was intentional
[9617.26 --> 9618.58]  I just didn't want it to be like
[9618.58 --> 9619.48]  Surprise
[9619.48 --> 9621.34]  I finally bought a fancy car
[9621.34 --> 9623.68]  So I think it made
[9623.68 --> 9624.42]  Its first appearance
[9624.42 --> 9624.96]  In the
[9624.96 --> 9626.38]  Heating the garage
[9626.38 --> 9627.48]  With mining video
[9627.48 --> 9628.42]  And then
[9628.42 --> 9629.70]  I alluded to what dealership
[9629.70 --> 9630.58]  It came from
[9630.58 --> 9631.30]  And then
[9631.30 --> 9632.18]  I think it
[9632.18 --> 9633.78]  I think I mentioned
[9633.78 --> 9635.46]  Porsche's infotainment system
[9635.46 --> 9636.88]  A little bit after that
[9636.88 --> 9637.86]  And then it showed up
[9637.86 --> 9638.68]  In the parking lot
[9638.68 --> 9639.46]  In the labs tour
[9639.46 --> 9640.26]  So I've kind of been
[9640.26 --> 9641.76]  I've wanted it to be
[9641.76 --> 9642.70]  Did it have the wrap on it?
[9643.24 --> 9643.56]  Yeah
[9643.56 --> 9647.52]  I've wanted it to be
[9647.52 --> 9648.90]  A little bit slower
[9648.90 --> 9649.90]  Just because I didn't want it
[9649.90 --> 9651.00]  To be like kind of a shock
[9651.00 --> 9652.10]  By the time people are like
[9652.10 --> 9653.16]  Oh you bought a fancy car
[9653.16 --> 9653.96]  I wanted it to kind of be
[9653.96 --> 9654.58]  Old news
[9654.58 --> 9655.98]  So mission sort of accomplished
[9655.98 --> 9656.36]  But
[9656.36 --> 9658.38]  My unintended consequence
[9658.38 --> 9659.30]  Has been that it's
[9659.30 --> 9660.64]  Created this intrigue
[9660.64 --> 9661.80]  Like I've talked a lot about
[9661.80 --> 9662.92]  How one of the best things
[9662.92 --> 9664.32]  We ever did for our privacy
[9664.32 --> 9665.74]  Was to just
[9665.74 --> 9667.02]  Announce the location
[9667.02 --> 9667.58]  Of our studio
[9667.58 --> 9668.62]  And put it on Google Maps
[9668.62 --> 9669.88]  Because all of a sudden
[9669.88 --> 9670.96]  Everyone immediately
[9670.96 --> 9671.60]  Stopped caring
[9671.60 --> 9671.86]  Yeah
[9671.86 --> 9673.36]  So I guess I kind of
[9673.36 --> 9674.24]  Forgot that lesson
[9674.24 --> 9675.06]  And I've been
[9675.06 --> 9675.76]  Sort of
[9675.76 --> 9677.30]  Intentionally
[9677.30 --> 9678.08]  Slowly
[9678.08 --> 9679.24]  You know
[9679.24 --> 9679.98]  Priming that
[9679.98 --> 9681.28]  Yes I bought a fancy car
[9681.28 --> 9682.60]  That hopefully
[9682.60 --> 9683.52]  Doesn't immediately
[9683.52 --> 9684.50]  Make me a complete
[9684.50 --> 9685.20]  Douchebag
[9685.20 --> 9686.04]  But yes
[9686.04 --> 9686.98]  I have a nice car now
[9686.98 --> 9689.02]  So let's put it to rest
[9689.02 --> 9689.82]  Once and for all
[9689.82 --> 9691.54]  It's a Porsche Taycan
[9691.54 --> 9693.04]  It's 2022
[9693.04 --> 9695.76]  It's higher spec
[9695.76 --> 9696.36]  Than I probably
[9696.36 --> 9696.88]  Would have
[9696.88 --> 9697.98]  Gone for
[9697.98 --> 9699.28]  But the deal
[9699.28 --> 9699.72]  Was
[9699.72 --> 9700.06]  Used
[9700.06 --> 9700.92]  Right
[9700.92 --> 9701.34]  Yeah
[9701.34 --> 9702.00]  It had
[9702.00 --> 9703.08]  Just over
[9703.08 --> 9704.42]  A thousand miles on it
[9704.42 --> 9705.52]  That's a pretty sweet
[9705.52 --> 9706.52]  Spot to buy used
[9706.52 --> 9707.12]  Which is
[9707.12 --> 9709.16]  It smelled new
[9709.16 --> 9709.54]  Yeah
[9709.54 --> 9710.02]  You know
[9710.02 --> 9710.34]  Yeah
[9710.34 --> 9712.12]  But because it was used
[9712.12 --> 9713.16]  There was no
[9713.16 --> 9714.28]  Provincial sales tax
[9714.28 --> 9715.74]  And no luxury tax
[9715.74 --> 9716.38]  Which is a tax
[9716.38 --> 9717.38]  That applies to
[9717.38 --> 9718.32]  Vehicles over a certain
[9718.32 --> 9719.28]  Value where we are
[9719.28 --> 9720.54]  Which by the way
[9720.54 --> 9722.42]  The average sale cost
[9722.42 --> 9722.92]  Of vehicles
[9722.92 --> 9724.06]  Is creeping up
[9724.06 --> 9725.20]  To that luxury tax
[9725.20 --> 9726.40]  Because all vehicles
[9726.40 --> 9727.44]  Are just expensive now
[9727.44 --> 9728.50]  They've gone down a lot
[9728.50 --> 9729.50]  I mean Tesla slashed
[9729.50 --> 9729.92]  Their prices
[9729.92 --> 9730.92]  Big time
[9730.92 --> 9731.96]  You see how many more
[9731.96 --> 9732.90]  Teslas are in the parking
[9732.90 --> 9733.16]  No
[9733.16 --> 9735.02]  Oh I was gonna say
[9735.02 --> 9735.82]  No you probably didn't
[9735.82 --> 9736.30]  Notice because you
[9736.30 --> 9736.86]  Don't work in office
[9736.86 --> 9737.50]  But yeah you come in
[9737.50 --> 9737.98]  For a man show
[9737.98 --> 9738.42]  Yeah
[9738.42 --> 9740.14]  Like four people
[9740.14 --> 9740.92]  Bought Teslas
[9740.92 --> 9742.28]  Immediately after the
[9742.28 --> 9742.76]  Price drops
[9742.76 --> 9744.00]  You see that
[9744.00 --> 9744.98]  I don't think all of them
[9744.98 --> 9746.06]  Have even been delivered yet
[9746.06 --> 9747.28]  Our parking lot
[9747.28 --> 9747.82]  Is just
[9747.82 --> 9749.36]  Basically looks like
[9749.36 --> 9750.56]  A Tesla service center
[9750.56 --> 9750.88]  Yeah
[9750.88 --> 9751.64]  It's
[9751.64 --> 9752.84]  Unbelievable
[9752.84 --> 9754.04]  Anyway
[9754.04 --> 9757.78]  So yes
[9757.78 --> 9758.52]  Yes
[9758.52 --> 9760.38]  Yeah how they got
[9760.38 --> 9760.66]  The
[9760.66 --> 9761.20]  How they got
[9761.20 --> 9762.26]  The truck
[9762.26 --> 9763.08]  Minivan
[9763.08 --> 9763.58]  Microvan
[9763.58 --> 9763.96]  I don't know
[9763.96 --> 9764.16]  Whatever
[9764.16 --> 9765.06]  How they got that back
[9765.06 --> 9765.48]  Was like
[9765.48 --> 9766.50]  Actually pretty cool
[9766.50 --> 9768.80]  Little community effort
[9768.80 --> 9769.38]  So yeah
[9769.38 --> 9770.20]  If it goes missing
[9770.20 --> 9771.16]  I can count on you guys
[9771.16 --> 9771.36]  Right
[9771.36 --> 9772.16]  Yeah
[9772.16 --> 9773.12]  Sweet
[9773.12 --> 9774.18]  Yeah
[9774.18 --> 9777.10]  Ooh
[9777.10 --> 9778.54]  We shot a video
[9778.54 --> 9779.26]  About this today
[9779.26 --> 9780.58]  This is super cool
[9780.58 --> 9782.64]  4K upscaling
[9782.64 --> 9783.78]  For web video
[9783.78 --> 9784.94]  NVIDIA
[9784.94 --> 9785.82]  Just announced
[9785.82 --> 9786.38]  RTX
[9786.38 --> 9787.68]  Super resolution
[9787.68 --> 9788.80]  Is now supported
[9788.80 --> 9789.46]  For users of
[9789.46 --> 9790.20]  RTX 30
[9790.20 --> 9791.26]  And 40 series
[9791.26 --> 9792.00]  GPUs
[9792.00 --> 9792.74]  We were talking
[9792.74 --> 9793.46]  Earlier in the show
[9793.46 --> 9793.72]  Sorry
[9793.72 --> 9794.42]  We were talking
[9794.42 --> 9795.26]  Earlier in the show
[9795.26 --> 9795.72]  About
[9795.72 --> 9796.34]  MOTES
[9796.34 --> 9797.46]  Yeah
[9797.46 --> 9798.38]  NVIDIA's
[9798.38 --> 9800.26]  Additional technology
[9800.26 --> 9801.32]  That you get to
[9801.32 --> 9801.92]  Leverage
[9801.92 --> 9803.04]  When you have their GPUs
[9803.04 --> 9803.84]  Is a moat
[9803.84 --> 9804.92]  Yes
[9804.92 --> 9805.56]  Yeah
[9805.56 --> 9806.60]  That's a perfect example
[9806.60 --> 9808.84]  So
[9808.84 --> 9810.20]  Upscaling
[9810.20 --> 9811.14]  For videos played
[9811.14 --> 9811.66]  In Chrome
[9811.66 --> 9812.54]  And Edge
[9812.54 --> 9813.14]  With support
[9813.14 --> 9814.44]  For the RTX 20 series
[9814.44 --> 9815.60]  Likely to come
[9815.60 --> 9816.02]  So we'll see
[9816.02 --> 9816.50]  How that goes
[9816.50 --> 9817.78]  Anything from
[9817.78 --> 9819.10]  A 360p
[9819.10 --> 9820.64]  To 1440p
[9820.64 --> 9821.36]  Plus video
[9821.36 --> 9822.00]  Is supported
[9822.00 --> 9823.14]  And can upscale
[9823.14 --> 9824.20]  Up to 4K
[9824.20 --> 9825.36]  4K upscaling
[9825.36 --> 9826.06]  Was previously
[9826.06 --> 9826.74]  Only available
[9826.74 --> 9827.80]  On NVIDIA's
[9827.80 --> 9828.42]  Shield TV
[9828.42 --> 9829.42]  And not
[9829.42 --> 9830.30]  For high refresh rate
[9830.30 --> 9830.60]  Video
[9830.60 --> 9831.42]  And it didn't go
[9831.42 --> 9831.92]  As low
[9831.92 --> 9833.20]  As 360p
[9833.20 --> 9835.06]  RTX VSR
[9835.06 --> 9835.40]  That's what
[9835.40 --> 9836.02]  They're calling it
[9836.02 --> 9837.56]  Uses AI upscaling
[9837.56 --> 9838.32]  To sharpen
[9838.32 --> 9839.30]  Low resolution video
[9839.30 --> 9839.98]  While removing
[9839.98 --> 9840.92]  Compression artifacts
[9840.92 --> 9842.68]  This is wild
[9842.68 --> 9843.10]  I'm not going to
[9843.10 --> 9843.78]  Spoil the whole video
[9843.78 --> 9844.34]  It's definitely
[9844.34 --> 9845.00]  Worth a watch
[9845.00 --> 9845.84]  But
[9845.84 --> 9847.62]  I actually
[9847.62 --> 9848.70]  Preferred
[9848.70 --> 9850.18]  The RTX
[9850.18 --> 9850.78]  Upscaled
[9850.78 --> 9851.54]  1080p
[9851.54 --> 9852.62]  To the native
[9852.62 --> 9853.66]  4K on YouTube
[9853.66 --> 9855.20]  Whoa
[9855.20 --> 9855.96]  Whoa
[9855.96 --> 9856.90]  Yeah
[9856.90 --> 9857.62]  That's
[9857.62 --> 9858.62]  Because 4K
[9858.62 --> 9858.96]  On YouTube
[9858.96 --> 9860.12]  Still has a lot
[9860.12 --> 9860.64]  Of banding
[9860.64 --> 9861.20]  It does
[9861.20 --> 9861.86]  It's pretty low
[9861.86 --> 9862.24]  Bitrate
[9862.24 --> 9862.64]  Yes
[9862.64 --> 9863.78]  So
[9863.78 --> 9865.02]  With a little
[9865.02 --> 9865.68]  Bit of sharpening
[9865.68 --> 9866.44]  Did you mess around
[9866.44 --> 9866.98]  With Flowplane at all
[9866.98 --> 9867.70]  And smoothing
[9867.70 --> 9869.10]  No I didn't think
[9869.10 --> 9869.74]  To try that
[9869.74 --> 9870.36]  I'm interested
[9870.36 --> 9871.80]  We should play around
[9871.80 --> 9872.18]  With it
[9872.18 --> 9872.90]  Because it's
[9872.90 --> 9873.44]  It's a little
[9873.44 --> 9874.56]  It's different
[9874.56 --> 9875.16]  Than Flowplane
[9875.16 --> 9875.70]  It worked on
[9875.70 --> 9876.20]  Sorry than YouTube
[9876.20 --> 9876.64]  It worked on
[9876.64 --> 9877.56]  CBC Gem
[9877.56 --> 9878.52]  Like it seems to
[9878.52 --> 9879.34]  Just work on anything
[9879.34 --> 9880.34]  I suspect it would work
[9880.34 --> 9881.00]  Which is cool
[9881.00 --> 9882.02]  I just wonder like
[9882.02 --> 9882.82]  It worked on Netflix
[9882.82 --> 9883.86]  So it worked on
[9883.86 --> 9885.00]  DRM protected content
[9885.00 --> 9885.86]  Which I wasn't sure
[9885.86 --> 9886.38]  If it would
[9886.38 --> 9887.16]  Interesting
[9887.16 --> 9887.50]  Yeah
[9887.50 --> 9888.06]  Like it's
[9888.06 --> 9888.92]  It's pretty cool
[9888.92 --> 9889.52]  That is actually
[9889.52 --> 9890.24]  Quite interesting
[9890.24 --> 9891.00]  And Flowplane
[9891.00 --> 9891.86]  Would be DRM protected
[9891.86 --> 9892.18]  As well
[9892.18 --> 9892.58]  So yeah
[9892.58 --> 9893.08]  Yeah
[9893.08 --> 9894.04]  Well okay
[9894.04 --> 9894.40]  No
[9894.40 --> 9895.70]  Don't worry about it
[9895.70 --> 9898.74]  So the
[9898.74 --> 9899.92]  The missing information
[9899.92 --> 9900.20]  Though
[9900.20 --> 9900.84]  Rather than just
[9900.84 --> 9901.78]  Like edge detection
[9901.78 --> 9902.36]  And sharpening
[9902.36 --> 9903.36]  Is predicted
[9903.36 --> 9904.52]  By a neural network
[9904.52 --> 9905.24]  That's trained on
[9905.24 --> 9906.02]  Large data sets
[9906.02 --> 9906.40]  Of images
[9906.40 --> 9907.28]  At different resolutions
[9907.28 --> 9907.98]  And replaced
[9907.98 --> 9908.78]  Which is how that works
[9908.78 --> 9909.68]  Welcome to everything
[9909.68 --> 9910.18]  These days
[9910.18 --> 9911.64]  It's pretty
[9911.64 --> 9912.48]  Impressive
[9912.48 --> 9914.42]  There are some issues
[9914.42 --> 9914.98]  And you guys are
[9914.98 --> 9915.38]  Going to want to
[9915.38 --> 9916.36]  Check out the video
[9916.36 --> 9916.70]  But
[9916.70 --> 9917.78]  Apparently someone
[9917.78 --> 9918.42]  In Flowplane chat
[9918.42 --> 9918.94]  Is using it
[9918.94 --> 9919.92]  To watch the stream
[9919.92 --> 9920.66]  On Flowplane
[9920.66 --> 9921.50]  Okay how is it
[9921.50 --> 9921.86]  Yeah
[9921.86 --> 9923.24]  Maybe talk about that
[9923.24 --> 9924.06]  While I run and go pee
[9924.06 --> 9924.42]  Sure
[9924.42 --> 9925.32]  My bladder's going to explode
[9925.32 --> 9927.68]  The show's too long
[9927.68 --> 9929.16]  Yeah we're already
[9929.16 --> 9930.02]  At three hours I think
[9930.02 --> 9931.28]  I think Dan left
[9931.28 --> 9932.22]  To like make coffee
[9932.22 --> 9932.92]  Is that what I heard
[9932.92 --> 9935.58]  No that's the
[9935.58 --> 9937.04]  Drainage system
[9937.04 --> 9938.28]  For the air conditioner
[9938.28 --> 9938.82]  Oh
[9938.82 --> 9940.26]  That makes sense
[9940.26 --> 9941.14]  I have done
[9941.14 --> 9944.08]  A merch message
[9944.08 --> 9945.36]  Every 22 seconds
[9945.36 --> 9945.86]  This stream
[9945.86 --> 9947.48]  Wow
[9947.48 --> 9948.90]  My fingers hurt
[9948.90 --> 9949.68]  My eyes hurt
[9949.68 --> 9951.70]  So I just had to go
[9951.70 --> 9952.22]  Look at something
[9952.22 --> 9953.08]  Far away for a while
[9953.08 --> 9954.48]  Yeah we're at
[9954.48 --> 9954.98]  Yeah we're at
[9954.98 --> 9955.62]  We're at a little bit
[9955.62 --> 9956.42]  Over three hours
[9956.42 --> 9956.76]  Okay
[9956.76 --> 9958.92]  I haven't seen a response
[9958.92 --> 9961.00]  Yet from Prometheus Awoken
[9961.00 --> 9961.66]  Who's the person
[9961.66 --> 9962.32]  Who said they're using it
[9962.32 --> 9962.88]  To watch the stream
[9962.88 --> 9963.34]  Right now
[9963.34 --> 9964.96]  Is anyone else
[9964.96 --> 9965.62]  Using it to watch
[9965.62 --> 9966.34]  The Flowplane stream
[9966.34 --> 9966.80]  Right now
[9966.80 --> 9969.46]  Maybe they will
[9969.46 --> 9970.98]  Respond soon
[9970.98 --> 9972.38]  Oh there it is
[9972.38 --> 9973.32]  Flowplane looks good
[9973.32 --> 9973.66]  Already
[9973.66 --> 9975.48]  But it's hard to believe
[9975.48 --> 9976.12]  This is live
[9976.12 --> 9976.96]  Quality is insane
[9976.96 --> 9978.58]  Does this mean we can
[9978.58 --> 9979.28]  Talk about the Christmas
[9979.28 --> 9979.60]  Album?
[9979.72 --> 9980.46]  I love that
[9980.46 --> 9981.02]  No
[9981.02 --> 9981.66]  I
[9981.66 --> 9983.14]  I'm not
[9983.14 --> 9984.06]  Maybe
[9984.06 --> 9984.40]  Maybe
[9984.40 --> 9985.40]  I
[9985.40 --> 9985.90]  I
[9985.90 --> 9986.82]  I love that comment
[9986.82 --> 9987.96]  Because
[9987.96 --> 9988.96]  Flowplane already
[9988.96 --> 9989.36]  Looks good
[9989.36 --> 9989.74]  It's great
[9989.74 --> 9990.86]  But the fact that it looks
[9990.86 --> 9991.68]  Even so much better
[9991.68 --> 9992.68]  Is fantastic
[9992.68 --> 9994.70]  Yeah what is the bit rate
[9994.70 --> 9995.24]  On Flowplane?
[9995.72 --> 9996.10]  Well
[9996.10 --> 9997.66]  So when people talk about
[9997.66 --> 9998.32]  Bit rate on YouTube
[9998.32 --> 9998.78]  As well
[9998.78 --> 9999.14]  It's not
[9999.14 --> 10000.36]  It's not really a fixed thing
[10000.36 --> 10002.66]  It'll
[10002.66 --> 10003.38]  It'll vary
[10003.38 --> 10003.84]  Right
[10003.84 --> 10004.36]  So we have like
[10004.36 --> 10005.24]  Targets and stuff
[10005.24 --> 10005.64]  But like
[10005.64 --> 10006.86]  It's
[10006.86 --> 10007.78]  It's variable bit rate
[10007.78 --> 10008.14]  It's gonna
[10008.14 --> 10009.04]  It's gonna change
[10009.04 --> 10009.60]  Quite a bit
[10009.60 --> 10010.80]  Across the course
[10010.80 --> 10011.28]  Of a video
[10011.28 --> 10012.46]  And there's
[10012.46 --> 10013.44]  There's videos
[10013.44 --> 10014.72]  Like just fully
[10014.72 --> 10015.20]  Self-emitting
[10015.20 --> 10015.52]  There's
[10015.52 --> 10016.20]  There's videos
[10016.20 --> 10016.98]  That Linus
[10016.98 --> 10017.84]  Tech Tips has uploaded
[10017.84 --> 10020.72]  That have parts of them
[10020.72 --> 10021.54]  That don't really look
[10021.54 --> 10022.00]  That good
[10022.00 --> 10022.76]  Because
[10022.76 --> 10023.70]  However
[10023.70 --> 10024.96]  The variable bit rate
[10024.96 --> 10025.60]  And compression
[10025.60 --> 10026.20]  All that kind of stuff
[10026.20 --> 10027.46]  Decided to deal with it
[10027.46 --> 10028.14]  It just didn't really
[10028.14 --> 10028.90]  Deal with it that well
[10028.90 --> 10030.42]  And that's true
[10030.42 --> 10032.12]  For every video platform
[10032.12 --> 10032.90]  That does those types
[10032.90 --> 10033.36]  Of things
[10033.36 --> 10034.86]  And we just try
[10034.86 --> 10035.46]  To target
[10035.46 --> 10037.40]  A better amount
[10037.40 --> 10037.88]  Than normal
[10037.88 --> 10038.56]  Basically
[10038.56 --> 10041.24]  The response was
[10041.24 --> 10043.42]  Where did
[10043.42 --> 10043.74]  It go
[10043.74 --> 10044.40]  Oh no
[10044.40 --> 10049.68]  Basically
[10049.68 --> 10050.14]  It's
[10050.14 --> 10050.88]  It's better
[10050.88 --> 10051.92]  They said
[10051.92 --> 10052.48]  Full plane video
[10052.48 --> 10053.46]  Is already really good
[10053.46 --> 10054.64]  But watching it
[10054.64 --> 10055.22]  Through the NVIDIA
[10055.22 --> 10055.88]  Oh there it is
[10055.88 --> 10057.64]  FP looks good already
[10057.64 --> 10058.66]  But it's hard to believe
[10058.66 --> 10059.30]  This is live
[10059.30 --> 10060.26]  Quality is insane
[10060.26 --> 10061.10]  Wow
[10061.10 --> 10062.00]  That's really cool
[10062.00 --> 10062.86]  Yeah
[10062.86 --> 10064.56]  That's super cool
[10064.56 --> 10066.24]  Our discussion question
[10066.24 --> 10067.28]  Is what does this mean
[10067.28 --> 10067.92]  For the future
[10067.92 --> 10069.06]  Of digital video streaming
[10069.06 --> 10070.40]  I mean right now
[10070.40 --> 10071.28]  Spoiler
[10071.28 --> 10073.22]  It consumes up to
[10073.22 --> 10074.24]  300 watts
[10074.24 --> 10075.60]  Of power
[10075.60 --> 10076.60]  So
[10076.60 --> 10077.78]  Nothing
[10077.78 --> 10080.30]  In the short term
[10080.30 --> 10081.28]  Because
[10081.28 --> 10082.68]  Realistically
[10082.68 --> 10083.62]  So much
[10083.62 --> 10084.86]  Of streaming video
[10084.86 --> 10085.40]  Consumption
[10085.40 --> 10086.02]  Is on devices
[10086.02 --> 10086.66]  Like this
[10086.66 --> 10087.60]  That would
[10087.60 --> 10088.68]  Light on fire
[10088.68 --> 10089.60]  If they were
[10089.60 --> 10090.78]  Consuming 300 watts
[10090.78 --> 10091.14]  Power
[10091.14 --> 10093.60]  But in the
[10093.60 --> 10094.56]  Very long term
[10094.56 --> 10095.32]  I could
[10095.32 --> 10096.16]  See it
[10096.16 --> 10097.76]  Fundamentally
[10097.76 --> 10098.44]  Changing
[10098.44 --> 10098.94]  The way
[10098.94 --> 10099.58]  That we build
[10099.58 --> 10100.34]  Video streaming
[10100.34 --> 10100.94]  Infrastructure
[10100.94 --> 10101.92]  Just kind of
[10101.92 --> 10102.34]  Going like
[10102.34 --> 10102.98]  Yeah
[10102.98 --> 10104.92]  Instead of
[10104.92 --> 10105.88]  Optimizing your
[10105.88 --> 10106.38]  Stream
[10106.38 --> 10107.60]  For what looks
[10107.60 --> 10108.74]  The best to the
[10108.74 --> 10109.06]  Eye
[10109.06 --> 10110.18]  At a given
[10110.18 --> 10110.58]  Bitrate
[10110.58 --> 10111.18]  You might start
[10111.18 --> 10111.64]  To optimize
[10111.64 --> 10112.28]  Your stream
[10112.28 --> 10112.72]  For
[10112.72 --> 10113.74]  You know
[10113.74 --> 10114.90]  What might be
[10114.90 --> 10115.68]  Most easily
[10115.68 --> 10116.46]  Interpreted
[10116.46 --> 10117.54]  By an AI
[10117.54 --> 10118.96]  Enhanced
[10118.96 --> 10119.70]  Or machine learning
[10119.70 --> 10120.62]  Enhanced player
[10120.62 --> 10122.28]  So for example
[10122.28 --> 10123.06]  Like you might
[10123.06 --> 10124.04]  Basically be able
[10124.04 --> 10125.12]  To encode
[10125.12 --> 10126.46]  Information into
[10126.46 --> 10126.92]  The video
[10126.92 --> 10127.62]  Like this is
[10127.62 --> 10128.72]  This is
[10128.72 --> 10130.12]  Like just put
[10130.12 --> 10131.04]  Like a pattern
[10131.04 --> 10131.56]  This is like
[10131.56 --> 10132.00]  A rock
[10132.00 --> 10133.82]  Outcropping
[10133.82 --> 10134.46]  Or whatever
[10134.46 --> 10134.82]  You know
[10134.82 --> 10135.74]  This is grass
[10135.74 --> 10137.14]  You know
[10137.14 --> 10137.60]  Fill in the
[10137.60 --> 10137.96]  Blanks
[10137.96 --> 10139.38]  Which could lead
[10139.38 --> 10140.26]  To people having
[10140.26 --> 10141.04]  Very different
[10141.04 --> 10142.06]  Viewing experiences
[10142.06 --> 10142.96]  Depending on
[10142.96 --> 10143.60]  Which
[10143.60 --> 10145.48]  Data set
[10145.48 --> 10146.22]  Their
[10146.22 --> 10147.40]  Machine learning
[10147.40 --> 10148.36]  Enhanced player
[10148.36 --> 10148.94]  Was trained on
[10148.94 --> 10149.64]  Like it
[10149.64 --> 10150.40]  Could be
[10150.40 --> 10151.28]  Like
[10151.28 --> 10152.16]  Okay you know
[10152.16 --> 10152.78]  That tool that
[10152.78 --> 10153.30]  NVIDIA built
[10153.30 --> 10153.72]  Where you just
[10153.72 --> 10154.32]  Like essentially
[10154.32 --> 10155.10]  MS paint
[10155.10 --> 10156.32]  And it turns
[10156.32 --> 10157.06]  Into a landscape
[10157.06 --> 10157.86]  Oh yeah yeah
[10157.86 --> 10158.16]  Yeah
[10158.16 --> 10159.70]  I could see it
[10159.70 --> 10160.98]  Being kind of
[10160.98 --> 10161.86]  Like that
[10161.86 --> 10162.30]  To a point
[10162.30 --> 10162.76]  Where you could
[10162.76 --> 10163.50]  Just stream
[10163.50 --> 10164.80]  Blocks of color
[10164.80 --> 10165.48]  And it would
[10165.48 --> 10166.14]  Just like
[10166.14 --> 10166.82]  Decide things
[10166.82 --> 10167.16]  Yeah
[10167.16 --> 10167.96]  You could have
[10167.96 --> 10168.42]  Metadata
[10168.42 --> 10170.48]  This actor is angry
[10170.48 --> 10171.36]  I don't think
[10171.36 --> 10172.32]  NVIDIA is going
[10172.32 --> 10173.20]  To build this
[10173.20 --> 10174.56]  That way
[10174.56 --> 10175.66]  But
[10175.66 --> 10176.92]  I think this
[10176.92 --> 10177.62]  Same technology
[10177.62 --> 10178.20]  Could absolutely
[10178.20 --> 10178.64]  Do that
[10178.64 --> 10179.18]  Like I bet
[10179.18 --> 10179.46]  You something
[10179.46 --> 10179.80]  That you could
[10179.80 --> 10180.52]  Do is with
[10180.52 --> 10181.26]  A certain pattern
[10181.26 --> 10181.72]  Like almost
[10181.72 --> 10182.76]  QR code style
[10182.76 --> 10183.96]  You could tell
[10183.96 --> 10185.24]  An interpretive
[10185.24 --> 10186.20]  Whatever
[10186.20 --> 10187.18]  To repeat
[10187.18 --> 10189.06]  Or to continue
[10189.06 --> 10189.48]  Yeah
[10189.48 --> 10190.16]  So you could have
[10190.16 --> 10191.12]  Like a certain pattern
[10191.12 --> 10192.58]  And then some indicator
[10192.58 --> 10193.66]  Amongst that pattern
[10193.66 --> 10194.88]  To take this pattern
[10194.88 --> 10195.50]  And either
[10195.50 --> 10196.68]  Continue it
[10196.68 --> 10197.88]  So change it as it goes
[10197.88 --> 10198.60]  But keep the theme
[10198.60 --> 10199.82]  Or to just repeat it
[10199.82 --> 10200.12]  So it's like
[10200.12 --> 10201.50]  Object based compression
[10201.50 --> 10202.00]  Almost
[10202.00 --> 10202.36]  Yeah
[10202.36 --> 10203.44]  Whoa
[10203.44 --> 10204.22]  So instead of
[10204.22 --> 10204.96]  Like you could have
[10204.96 --> 10206.50]  Like a wall
[10206.50 --> 10207.04]  Yeah
[10207.04 --> 10207.74]  Like this wall
[10207.74 --> 10208.54]  Which they can't really see
[10208.54 --> 10209.26]  But you could have
[10209.26 --> 10210.20]  Like a more complicated
[10210.20 --> 10211.20]  Design on a wall
[10211.20 --> 10211.68]  Yeah
[10211.68 --> 10212.72]  But then instead of
[10212.72 --> 10214.34]  Filling all your bit rate
[10214.34 --> 10215.60]  With that complicated design
[10215.60 --> 10216.66]  It's almost like mocap
[10216.66 --> 10217.92]  Like motion
[10217.92 --> 10218.98]  So you could almost have
[10218.98 --> 10219.38]  Like
[10219.38 --> 10219.76]  Like
[10219.76 --> 10220.32]  Like
[10220.32 --> 10221.08]  Encoded
[10221.08 --> 10222.24]  Like dots
[10222.24 --> 10222.52]  Like
[10222.52 --> 10223.70]  Like object markers
[10223.70 --> 10224.46]  Yeah
[10224.46 --> 10225.00]  And then you
[10225.00 --> 10225.66]  Essentially
[10225.66 --> 10226.54]  Tell it to put
[10226.54 --> 10227.06]  Whatever there
[10227.06 --> 10227.88]  Streaming data
[10227.88 --> 10229.86]  You are actually just
[10229.86 --> 10231.42]  Rendering it
[10231.42 --> 10232.70]  In
[10232.70 --> 10233.94]  In subsequent frames
[10233.94 --> 10235.50]  It wouldn't work very well
[10235.50 --> 10236.00]  For really
[10236.00 --> 10237.22]  Fast paced video
[10237.22 --> 10238.04]  But for something like
[10238.04 --> 10238.56]  WAN show
[10238.56 --> 10239.84]  You could probably get
[10239.84 --> 10240.40]  The bit rate
[10240.40 --> 10241.58]  Essentially down to
[10241.58 --> 10242.22]  Like
[10242.22 --> 10242.48]  Like
[10242.48 --> 10242.84]  Like
[10242.84 --> 10243.62]  Negligible
[10243.62 --> 10245.06]  And I wonder if
[10245.06 --> 10245.64]  There's ways
[10245.64 --> 10246.16]  That you could
[10246.16 --> 10247.18]  Communicate to it
[10247.18 --> 10247.50]  Like
[10247.50 --> 10248.70]  Confetti cannon
[10248.70 --> 10249.96]  Because one of the
[10249.96 --> 10250.52]  Biggest things that
[10250.52 --> 10251.48]  Compression algorithms
[10251.48 --> 10252.60]  Have a lot of problem with
[10252.60 --> 10254.56]  Is lots of small things
[10254.56 --> 10255.24]  That are moving
[10255.24 --> 10256.14]  And shifting
[10256.14 --> 10257.54]  So confetti
[10257.54 --> 10258.40]  Has always been this
[10258.40 --> 10258.62]  Like
[10258.62 --> 10260.56]  People noticed it
[10260.56 --> 10261.40]  Originally from
[10261.40 --> 10263.00]  When
[10263.00 --> 10263.92]  When
[10263.92 --> 10265.48]  We moved to
[10265.48 --> 10266.24]  Digital video
[10266.24 --> 10266.94]  For TVs
[10266.94 --> 10268.40]  And the NFL
[10268.40 --> 10269.16]  Was playing
[10269.16 --> 10269.96]  Yeah
[10269.96 --> 10270.54]  They would shoot
[10270.54 --> 10271.32]  Confetti cannons
[10271.32 --> 10272.14]  At the end of the game
[10272.14 --> 10272.72]  And the whole thing
[10272.72 --> 10273.28]  Would just turn into
[10273.28 --> 10274.24]  Like fuzzy snow
[10274.24 --> 10275.26]  You can't see anything
[10275.26 --> 10276.18]  And people were
[10276.18 --> 10277.00]  Very confused about it
[10277.00 --> 10278.08]  It's the same problem
[10278.08 --> 10278.72]  We have today
[10278.72 --> 10279.72]  Literally the exact
[10279.72 --> 10280.16]  Same thing
[10280.16 --> 10280.98]  You have digital video
[10280.98 --> 10281.78]  You compress it
[10281.78 --> 10283.16]  You put too many things
[10283.16 --> 10283.62]  Moving
[10283.62 --> 10284.82]  In different ways
[10284.82 --> 10285.54]  And it's just
[10285.54 --> 10286.98]  Your quality is just
[10286.98 --> 10287.56]  Going to tank
[10287.56 --> 10288.28]  Immediately
[10288.28 --> 10289.38]  So if you could just
[10289.38 --> 10290.20]  Tell the GPU
[10290.20 --> 10290.90]  To do that
[10290.90 --> 10291.98]  And just tell it
[10291.98 --> 10292.96]  To generate it
[10292.96 --> 10293.72]  Instead of needing
[10293.72 --> 10294.32]  To like
[10294.32 --> 10296.62]  Deal with all these changes
[10296.62 --> 10297.48]  Very cool
[10297.48 --> 10298.38]  Be really interesting
[10298.38 --> 10299.28]  YouTube announces
[10299.28 --> 10300.32]  Some vague new
[10300.32 --> 10301.30]  AI tools
[10301.30 --> 10302.52]  Something something
[10302.52 --> 10304.98]  Create artificial scenes
[10304.98 --> 10306.26]  Swap clothing virtually
[10306.26 --> 10307.78]  Sounds like kind of
[10307.78 --> 10309.18]  VTuber stuff
[10309.18 --> 10310.46]  They're also apparently
[10310.46 --> 10311.18]  Rolling out a feature
[10311.18 --> 10311.76]  Where creators
[10311.76 --> 10312.82]  Can record a short
[10312.82 --> 10314.14]  Parallel to another video
[10314.14 --> 10315.14]  Similar to TikTok's
[10315.14 --> 10315.74]  Duet feature
[10315.74 --> 10317.20]  It also happens to be
[10317.20 --> 10318.02]  Similar to YouTube's
[10318.02 --> 10318.84]  Own long defunct
[10318.84 --> 10320.04]  Video responses feature
[10320.04 --> 10321.04]  Which was discontinued
[10321.04 --> 10322.16]  September 2013
[10322.16 --> 10323.42]  Because it had a
[10323.42 --> 10323.86]  Click through rate
[10323.86 --> 10326.14]  Of .0004%
[10326.14 --> 10327.40]  At the scale
[10327.40 --> 10328.20]  YouTube's at now
[10328.20 --> 10329.72]  .0004%
[10329.72 --> 10330.40]  Could actually be
[10330.40 --> 10330.88]  Worth having
[10330.88 --> 10333.72]  I think that's
[10333.72 --> 10334.18]  Pretty much it
[10334.18 --> 10334.82]  For topics today
[10334.82 --> 10335.54]  We've got a thing
[10335.54 --> 10336.22]  Where artists
[10336.22 --> 10337.00]  And computer scientists
[10337.00 --> 10337.48]  Are designing
[10337.48 --> 10338.40]  Anti-facial recognition
[10338.40 --> 10338.94]  Clothes
[10338.94 --> 10340.40]  It's pretty cool
[10340.40 --> 10341.84]  But I think we can
[10341.84 --> 10342.60]  Leave it for a week
[10342.60 --> 10343.22]  Where we aren't
[10343.22 --> 10344.44]  Already three hours in
[10344.44 --> 10346.50]  With a lot of
[10346.50 --> 10347.00]  Merge messages
[10347.00 --> 10347.56]  To get through
[10347.56 --> 10348.40]  Do we want to deal
[10348.40 --> 10349.24]  With these extra topics
[10349.24 --> 10349.60]  Or no?
[10349.94 --> 10350.70]  The ones at the bottom?
[10350.84 --> 10351.08]  Yes
[10351.08 --> 10352.68]  No, no
[10352.68 --> 10353.40]  I don't think we need to
[10353.40 --> 10354.06]  No and no
[10354.06 --> 10354.48]  We're not going to
[10354.48 --> 10354.94]  Talk about you
[10354.94 --> 10355.66]  Organizing and your
[10355.66 --> 10356.10]  Wrecked thumb
[10356.10 --> 10356.74]  I'm sorry to hear
[10356.74 --> 10357.38]  About your thumb though
[10357.38 --> 10358.08]  It's okay
[10358.08 --> 10360.00]  Merch messages time
[10360.00 --> 10360.76]  Let's go
[10360.76 --> 10362.54]  When show after hours
[10362.54 --> 10364.08]  Alright, here we go
[10364.08 --> 10364.86]  We've got quite a few
[10364.86 --> 10365.42]  Tonight
[10365.42 --> 10366.62]  There's been a lot
[10366.62 --> 10367.38]  Of merch messages
[10367.38 --> 10368.28]  First one up here
[10368.28 --> 10369.10]  Is from Jeremy
[10369.10 --> 10370.54]  How reliable
[10370.54 --> 10371.44]  Was your Thunderbolt
[10371.44 --> 10373.24]  To closet PC setup?
[10373.68 --> 10374.30]  Thunderbolt always
[10374.30 --> 10375.12]  Seems to be finicky
[10375.12 --> 10376.12]  For us in the
[10376.12 --> 10376.88]  Workplace
[10376.88 --> 10377.74]  When it works
[10377.74 --> 10378.54]  It's great
[10378.54 --> 10379.46]  But you probably
[10379.46 --> 10380.52]  Noticed that I have
[10380.52 --> 10382.18]  Other boxes on my desk
[10382.18 --> 10384.22]  They're from a company
[10384.22 --> 10385.22]  Called iKron
[10385.22 --> 10387.00]  And they do optical USB
[10387.00 --> 10389.40]  Those things are bulletproof
[10389.40 --> 10390.74]  When my Thunderbolt
[10390.74 --> 10392.28]  I always have my peripherals
[10392.28 --> 10393.30]  Connected to that
[10393.30 --> 10394.86]  So that in the event
[10394.86 --> 10395.88]  That I need to troubleshoot
[10395.88 --> 10397.36]  My stupid Thunderbolt dock
[10397.36 --> 10399.70]  I have a working keyboard
[10399.70 --> 10400.12]  And mouse
[10400.12 --> 10401.70]  I also have an optical
[10401.70 --> 10402.42]  Display port
[10402.42 --> 10404.22]  Directly from my computer
[10404.22 --> 10405.32]  To my monitor now
[10405.32 --> 10406.24]  Through the walls
[10406.24 --> 10408.06]  Rather than relying on
[10408.06 --> 10409.28]  Thunderbolt to carry DP
[10409.28 --> 10410.92]  For that same reason
[10410.92 --> 10411.40]  When it works
[10411.40 --> 10412.20]  It's amazing
[10412.20 --> 10413.36]  And just one cable
[10413.36 --> 10414.44]  Blah blah blah blah blah
[10414.44 --> 10415.62]  But when it doesn't work
[10415.62 --> 10416.18]  Boy is it ever
[10416.18 --> 10417.06]  A pain in the butt
[10417.06 --> 10418.90]  Okay next one
[10418.90 --> 10419.60]  Here's from Justin
[10419.60 --> 10420.50]  Hey guys
[10420.50 --> 10421.18]  I enjoy listening
[10421.18 --> 10421.80]  To the WAN show
[10421.80 --> 10422.90]  On my Friday nights
[10422.90 --> 10423.66]  While catching up
[10423.66 --> 10424.50]  On the week's email
[10424.50 --> 10425.74]  As your jobs
[10425.74 --> 10426.70]  Get more administrative
[10426.70 --> 10428.08]  And less technical
[10428.08 --> 10429.12]  How do you keep up
[10429.12 --> 10429.88]  With your tech skills?
[10431.24 --> 10432.18]  I still end up
[10432.18 --> 10433.44]  Doing a lot of tech stuff
[10433.44 --> 10435.92]  Like I still get called in
[10435.92 --> 10437.06]  To help with stuff sometimes
[10437.06 --> 10437.46]  You know
[10437.46 --> 10440.50]  I know just enough
[10440.50 --> 10441.96]  About everything
[10441.96 --> 10444.32]  Which is sort of unique
[10444.32 --> 10445.30]  In the office here
[10445.30 --> 10446.80]  Like there's obviously
[10446.80 --> 10447.70]  A lot of things
[10447.70 --> 10448.26]  That you know
[10448.26 --> 10448.72]  An Anthony
[10448.72 --> 10450.08]  Or an Alex
[10450.08 --> 10452.66]  Know more than me about
[10452.66 --> 10454.38]  But there's still things
[10454.38 --> 10455.28]  That I know more about
[10455.28 --> 10455.74]  Than them
[10455.74 --> 10456.34]  Like I'm
[10456.34 --> 10457.98]  I'm a generalist
[10457.98 --> 10458.76]  Right
[10458.76 --> 10459.74]  So
[10459.74 --> 10462.28]  I still end up
[10462.28 --> 10463.88]  Doing a lot
[10463.88 --> 10465.52]  I also am surrounded
[10465.52 --> 10466.32]  By people
[10466.32 --> 10467.54]  Who know more
[10467.54 --> 10467.84]  Like
[10467.84 --> 10469.34]  No matter what it is
[10469.34 --> 10469.66]  Okay
[10469.66 --> 10470.94]  So no matter who you are
[10470.94 --> 10471.70]  There's something I know
[10471.70 --> 10472.40]  More than you about
[10472.40 --> 10474.04]  But no matter what it is
[10474.04 --> 10475.36]  There's someone in this building
[10475.36 --> 10476.36]  That knows way more
[10476.36 --> 10477.10]  About it than me
[10477.10 --> 10478.84]  So I pick up a lot
[10478.84 --> 10479.72]  By osmosis
[10479.72 --> 10480.00]  Yeah
[10480.00 --> 10480.56]  Just
[10480.56 --> 10482.20]  Being around
[10482.20 --> 10483.24]  You know
[10483.24 --> 10483.68]  Hearing
[10483.68 --> 10485.10]  Hearing what the trials
[10485.10 --> 10486.10]  And tribulations were
[10486.10 --> 10487.50]  And seeing the solution
[10487.50 --> 10488.92]  Like I'm immersed in this stuff
[10488.92 --> 10489.68]  All day
[10489.68 --> 10490.22]  Every day
[10490.22 --> 10491.22]  So even though a lot of it's
[10491.22 --> 10491.78]  Administrative
[10491.78 --> 10493.56]  A lot of the admin stuff
[10493.56 --> 10494.12]  That I do
[10494.12 --> 10495.44]  Like paperworky stuff
[10495.44 --> 10496.22]  Is things like
[10496.22 --> 10497.20]  Script review
[10497.20 --> 10498.36]  So
[10498.36 --> 10499.40]  Yeah
[10499.40 --> 10499.94]  On the one hand
[10499.94 --> 10501.18]  I did a lot of admin this week
[10501.18 --> 10502.32]  But I also
[10502.32 --> 10504.20]  Got into the weeds
[10504.20 --> 10505.78]  Of how applications worked
[10505.78 --> 10507.42]  On Apple's
[10507.42 --> 10508.32]  XServe
[10508.32 --> 10509.84]  Line of servers
[10509.84 --> 10511.14]  We've got a video coming
[10511.14 --> 10511.86]  About those by the way
[10511.86 --> 10512.62]  We got our hands on
[10512.62 --> 10513.50]  The last model
[10513.50 --> 10514.28]  That they ever built
[10514.28 --> 10515.48]  Like played around with it
[10515.48 --> 10516.80]  You know why it died?
[10517.82 --> 10518.44]  Spoiler alert
[10518.44 --> 10519.16]  It's too good
[10519.16 --> 10521.38]  It's too good
[10521.38 --> 10521.90]  Do you just like
[10521.90 --> 10522.72]  Never have to swap them out
[10522.72 --> 10523.10]  Or something?
[10523.48 --> 10523.74]  Well
[10523.74 --> 10524.96]  So that's part of it
[10524.96 --> 10526.26]  But that's not
[10526.26 --> 10527.20]  The biggest part of it
[10527.20 --> 10528.24]  Because the way that
[10528.24 --> 10529.16]  Apple manages
[10529.16 --> 10530.54]  Hardware obsolescence
[10530.54 --> 10531.68]  Is through not providing
[10531.68 --> 10532.50]  Software updates anymore
[10532.50 --> 10533.04]  So realistically
[10533.04 --> 10533.82]  They could have
[10533.82 --> 10535.22]  Just you know
[10535.22 --> 10536.56]  Shortened the
[10536.56 --> 10538.68]  Software support cycle
[10538.68 --> 10538.94]  On it
[10538.94 --> 10539.78]  Or something like that
[10539.78 --> 10542.80]  But what they were up against
[10542.80 --> 10544.60]  Was completely different
[10544.60 --> 10545.36]  Revenue models
[10545.36 --> 10548.30]  Their model
[10548.30 --> 10548.86]  Right
[10548.86 --> 10550.74]  Is to sell hardware
[10550.74 --> 10552.72]  For better or for worse
[10552.72 --> 10553.44]  Or at least
[10553.44 --> 10553.70]  You know
[10553.70 --> 10554.48]  In 2009
[10554.48 --> 10554.98]  Yeah
[10554.98 --> 10557.04]  Well how do they
[10557.04 --> 10558.06]  Compete then
[10558.06 --> 10559.48]  With you know
[10559.48 --> 10560.04]  Microsoft
[10560.04 --> 10561.18]  And their partners
[10561.18 --> 10561.76]  Like Dell
[10561.76 --> 10562.60]  Or HP Enterprise
[10562.60 --> 10564.16]  Where they charge you
[10564.16 --> 10564.68]  For the hardware
[10564.68 --> 10565.94]  And then you pay
[10565.94 --> 10566.68]  For the software
[10566.68 --> 10567.60]  And then you pay
[10567.60 --> 10568.92]  For client access licenses
[10568.92 --> 10570.92]  And at that time
[10570.92 --> 10571.98]  They were trying to figure out
[10571.98 --> 10572.74]  How to turn everything
[10572.74 --> 10573.68]  Service based
[10573.68 --> 10574.98]  And Apple's sitting here
[10574.98 --> 10575.72]  Going well we're going
[10575.72 --> 10576.86]  To have a riot on our hands
[10576.86 --> 10577.96]  If we try to convert
[10577.96 --> 10578.52]  Like this
[10578.52 --> 10579.88]  Why are we even bothering
[10579.88 --> 10580.62]  When everything's going
[10580.62 --> 10581.50]  To go to the cloud anyway
[10581.50 --> 10583.36]  So
[10583.36 --> 10584.74]  They're sitting there going
[10584.74 --> 10585.52]  Okay how do we turn this
[10585.52 --> 10586.80]  Into a recurring revenue model
[10586.80 --> 10587.62]  We can either
[10587.62 --> 10588.44]  You know
[10588.44 --> 10589.56]  Duke it out
[10589.56 --> 10591.26]  In like this stupid
[10591.26 --> 10592.70]  Specialized hardware space
[10592.70 --> 10593.68]  Or
[10593.68 --> 10595.00]  We can just turn everything
[10595.00 --> 10595.38]  Into
[10595.38 --> 10596.54]  Software
[10596.54 --> 10598.46]  Sorry everything into
[10598.46 --> 10599.28]  Like a service based
[10599.28 --> 10600.34]  Cloud based solution
[10600.34 --> 10602.20]  Obviously we know
[10602.20 --> 10602.78]  Which way they went
[10602.78 --> 10602.96]  Right
[10602.96 --> 10603.38]  Yeah
[10603.38 --> 10604.92]  It's so good
[10604.92 --> 10606.26]  It does so much
[10606.26 --> 10607.42]  And you just like
[10607.42 --> 10608.44]  Get new software
[10608.44 --> 10609.02]  That just
[10609.02 --> 10610.16]  Comes out for it
[10610.16 --> 10610.86]  And
[10610.86 --> 10612.30]  There were some
[10612.30 --> 10612.84]  You know
[10612.84 --> 10614.26]  Dumb locked into
[10614.26 --> 10615.36]  The Apple ecosystem things
[10615.36 --> 10616.14]  You had to buy
[10616.14 --> 10617.18]  Their hard drive
[10617.18 --> 10618.02]  For example
[10618.02 --> 10618.48]  Oh yeah
[10618.48 --> 10618.74]  Gross
[10618.74 --> 10619.60]  Yeah stuff like that
[10619.60 --> 10620.26]  But
[10620.26 --> 10623.12]  Once it was up and running
[10623.12 --> 10624.28]  I can see why people
[10624.28 --> 10624.82]  Loved them
[10624.82 --> 10626.10]  And people did
[10626.10 --> 10627.02]  Like I couldn't figure
[10627.02 --> 10628.20]  I couldn't figure out
[10628.20 --> 10630.52]  Before we really dug into it
[10630.52 --> 10631.80]  Why anyone cared
[10631.80 --> 10632.80]  That XServe went away
[10632.80 --> 10634.50]  Now I get it
[10634.50 --> 10635.70]  It acted as
[10635.70 --> 10636.36]  You could use it
[10636.36 --> 10637.04]  For like Windows
[10637.04 --> 10637.88]  Domain services
[10637.88 --> 10638.84]  Oh
[10638.84 --> 10640.02]  Yeah right
[10640.02 --> 10641.06]  I wouldn't have expected that
[10641.06 --> 10641.92]  SMB file
[10641.92 --> 10643.56]  File sharing
[10643.56 --> 10644.96]  Like it did everything
[10644.96 --> 10646.64]  Very cool
[10646.64 --> 10647.04]  Yeah
[10647.04 --> 10650.32]  Okay next one's up
[10650.32 --> 10651.26]  From Zach
[10651.26 --> 10653.10]  Hey Linus and Luke
[10653.10 --> 10653.94]  I bought a house
[10653.94 --> 10654.96]  A year and a half ago
[10654.96 --> 10655.70]  Congratulations
[10655.70 --> 10656.52]  Nice
[10656.52 --> 10657.12]  Oh
[10657.12 --> 10658.38]  It's been a money pit
[10658.38 --> 10658.84]  Oh
[10658.84 --> 10659.78]  Yes
[10659.78 --> 10660.64]  Would you like your
[10660.64 --> 10661.36]  Retractor statement
[10661.36 --> 10663.52]  Last week my roof leaked
[10663.52 --> 10665.02]  And badly damaged
[10665.02 --> 10666.56]  My ceiling and floor
[10666.56 --> 10667.38]  Do you have any
[10667.38 --> 10668.68]  Homeowner horror stories
[10668.68 --> 10669.24]  Well
[10669.24 --> 10671.66]  My garage
[10671.66 --> 10672.82]  Has a roof leak in it
[10672.82 --> 10674.86]  The roofers have been
[10674.86 --> 10675.82]  Back to fix it once
[10675.82 --> 10677.38]  It leaked again
[10677.38 --> 10678.06]  In the snow
[10678.06 --> 10679.22]  This most recent snow
[10679.22 --> 10680.66]  So it's all
[10680.66 --> 10681.80]  It's all wet again
[10681.80 --> 10683.46]  So that's cool
[10683.46 --> 10686.22]  I know Luke
[10686.22 --> 10687.40]  Has had some horror stories
[10687.40 --> 10688.90]  My bathroom has leaked
[10688.90 --> 10690.38]  Three times
[10690.38 --> 10691.20]  Because I was being
[10691.20 --> 10692.22]  Gaslit by everyone
[10692.22 --> 10693.16]  That came to repair it
[10693.16 --> 10694.06]  And they kept telling me
[10694.06 --> 10694.70]  That it was something
[10694.70 --> 10695.42]  That it wasn't
[10695.42 --> 10696.56]  And then I finally
[10696.56 --> 10698.32]  Got my like dad
[10698.32 --> 10698.96]  In who
[10698.96 --> 10700.04]  Can't do it himself
[10700.04 --> 10700.58]  Because he's not a
[10700.58 --> 10701.46]  Licensed plumber anymore
[10701.46 --> 10701.80]  Yeah
[10701.80 --> 10702.54]  But he's a plumbing
[10702.54 --> 10703.34]  Instructor and
[10703.34 --> 10704.06]  Knows his
[10704.06 --> 10706.38]  So he came in
[10706.38 --> 10707.60]  And actually figured out
[10707.60 --> 10708.58]  What was actually happening
[10708.58 --> 10709.06]  Yeah
[10709.06 --> 10710.34]  And then he got
[10710.34 --> 10711.64]  One of his students
[10711.64 --> 10712.06]  Who is a
[10712.06 --> 10712.98]  Ex-students
[10712.98 --> 10713.66]  Who is a licensed plumber
[10713.66 --> 10714.64]  Now to come in and fix it
[10714.64 --> 10715.46]  And now it hasn't been
[10715.46 --> 10716.16]  A problem anymore
[10716.16 --> 10717.66]  But that leaked
[10717.66 --> 10718.52]  Multiple times
[10718.52 --> 10719.78]  The roof is leaked
[10719.78 --> 10721.14]  Twice
[10721.14 --> 10723.40]  The whole building
[10723.40 --> 10724.18]  Had this like
[10724.18 --> 10725.80]  Christmas tree style leak
[10725.80 --> 10726.70]  Because there was a leak
[10726.70 --> 10727.74]  On the top floor
[10727.74 --> 10728.98]  That leaked out
[10728.98 --> 10729.64]  And down
[10729.64 --> 10730.90]  Throughout the entire building
[10730.90 --> 10731.94]  Twice
[10731.94 --> 10733.68]  Because it happened
[10733.68 --> 10734.58]  And then the company
[10734.58 --> 10735.40]  That was trying to
[10735.40 --> 10736.16]  Restore the building
[10736.16 --> 10736.90]  From it happening
[10736.90 --> 10738.34]  Caused another one
[10738.34 --> 10738.74]  To happen
[10738.74 --> 10739.56]  On the floor
[10739.56 --> 10740.70]  Right below that one
[10740.70 --> 10741.40]  Sick
[10741.40 --> 10743.34]  So it happened again
[10743.34 --> 10744.36]  And then it took them
[10744.36 --> 10745.50]  Like a year to fix that
[10745.50 --> 10746.50]  And then a bunch
[10746.50 --> 10747.06]  Of other things
[10747.06 --> 10747.76]  Got wrecked
[10747.76 --> 10748.08]  And just
[10748.08 --> 10750.38]  It's been
[10750.38 --> 10752.32]  Just a
[10752.32 --> 10753.98]  Living nightmare
[10753.98 --> 10754.98]  Basically
[10754.98 --> 10755.94]  Do you remember
[10755.94 --> 10756.82]  The engineered hardwood
[10756.82 --> 10757.44]  That we put in
[10757.44 --> 10758.40]  As part of the
[10758.40 --> 10759.96]  Cleanest living room upgrade
[10759.96 --> 10760.94]  Like when we went
[10760.94 --> 10761.70]  From the dark brown
[10761.70 --> 10762.20]  To the grey
[10762.20 --> 10762.60]  Yeah
[10762.60 --> 10764.94]  So we chose that
[10764.94 --> 10767.02]  From a local flooring store
[10767.02 --> 10769.06]  And the supplier for it
[10769.06 --> 10770.04]  Was in California
[10770.04 --> 10772.46]  And basically what happened
[10772.46 --> 10774.90]  Was they installed it here
[10774.90 --> 10778.58]  Our humidity
[10778.58 --> 10779.52]  Apparently either
[10779.52 --> 10780.20]  Is too high
[10780.20 --> 10781.62]  Or fluctuates too much
[10781.62 --> 10784.00]  And the whole thing
[10784.00 --> 10785.00]  Contracted
[10785.00 --> 10786.22]  And ripped it apart
[10786.22 --> 10787.38]  There's gaps in that floor
[10787.38 --> 10787.90]  This big
[10787.90 --> 10789.30]  Yeah
[10789.30 --> 10789.70]  Between
[10789.70 --> 10790.66]  Between the boards
[10790.66 --> 10793.70]  The installer
[10793.70 --> 10794.74]  Tried to blame
[10794.74 --> 10795.28]  The store
[10795.28 --> 10796.26]  The store
[10796.26 --> 10796.78]  Tried to blame
[10796.78 --> 10797.52]  The manufacturer
[10797.52 --> 10798.94]  They
[10798.94 --> 10799.74]  Like
[10799.74 --> 10800.48]  Sent in
[10800.48 --> 10801.24]  Like a third party
[10801.24 --> 10801.64]  Expert
[10801.64 --> 10802.08]  Basically
[10802.08 --> 10802.58]  To try to
[10802.58 --> 10803.24]  Gaslight us
[10803.24 --> 10803.90]  Into that
[10803.90 --> 10804.44]  Our house
[10804.44 --> 10804.70]  Was
[10804.70 --> 10805.76]  First they told us
[10805.76 --> 10806.34]  It wasn't humid
[10806.34 --> 10806.70]  Enough
[10806.70 --> 10807.78]  Then they told us
[10807.78 --> 10808.56]  It was too humid
[10808.56 --> 10810.10]  Fortunately we had a nest
[10810.10 --> 10811.20]  That monitored our humidity
[10811.20 --> 10811.82]  Constantly
[10811.82 --> 10812.16]  We were like
[10812.16 --> 10812.46]  Um
[10812.46 --> 10813.32]  Actually no
[10813.32 --> 10814.90]  That ain't it
[10814.90 --> 10816.86]  This is a defective product
[10816.86 --> 10818.06]  You guys didn't
[10818.06 --> 10818.88]  Allow it to
[10818.88 --> 10820.10]  Whatever enough
[10820.10 --> 10820.64]  Or you didn't
[10820.64 --> 10821.52]  Secure it well enough
[10821.52 --> 10822.08]  Or you didn't
[10822.08 --> 10822.88]  You buffered
[10822.88 --> 10824.10]  You buffered
[10824.10 --> 10824.78]  Too little
[10824.78 --> 10825.36]  Or too much
[10825.36 --> 10826.18]  You did something
[10826.18 --> 10826.54]  Yeah
[10826.54 --> 10827.48]  Or the product
[10827.48 --> 10827.70]  Just
[10827.70 --> 10828.08]  Anyway
[10828.08 --> 10829.66]  They ultimately
[10829.66 --> 10831.56]  Never fully fixed it
[10831.56 --> 10833.36]  And unless we want to
[10833.36 --> 10833.96]  Sue them
[10833.96 --> 10834.76]  There's nothing
[10834.76 --> 10835.76]  That we can do about it
[10835.76 --> 10837.52]  I mean there's my pool
[10837.52 --> 10838.36]  That isn't done yet
[10838.36 --> 10839.30]  That's pretty cool
[10839.30 --> 10840.74]  Um there was also
[10840.74 --> 10842.06]  When I installed the
[10842.06 --> 10843.58]  Uh the DIY air conditioning
[10843.58 --> 10846.34]  Well first
[10846.34 --> 10847.32]  It leaked
[10847.32 --> 10848.50]  Uh because
[10848.50 --> 10849.66]  I made a mistake
[10849.66 --> 10850.90]  And then that was fixed
[10850.90 --> 10851.48]  Pretty quickly
[10851.48 --> 10852.52]  But you know
[10852.52 --> 10853.56]  Caused a little bit of damage
[10853.56 --> 10854.50]  Then
[10854.50 --> 10855.94]  We got
[10855.94 --> 10856.36]  Uh you know
[10856.36 --> 10857.20]  By the laundry room
[10857.20 --> 10859.14]  The ceiling
[10859.14 --> 10860.00]  Yeah the old place
[10860.00 --> 10860.98]  The ceiling there
[10860.98 --> 10861.56]  Was like
[10861.56 --> 10862.76]  Bad
[10862.76 --> 10863.56]  And like
[10863.56 --> 10864.46]  The floor was wet
[10864.46 --> 10865.54]  Oh this was the new floor
[10865.54 --> 10866.40]  Brand new floor
[10866.40 --> 10866.94]  Was wet
[10866.94 --> 10867.58]  And was like
[10867.58 --> 10868.04]  Rippling
[10868.04 --> 10869.28]  Um so that was
[10869.28 --> 10870.32]  Separate from the
[10870.32 --> 10871.22]  Issue with the floor
[10871.22 --> 10872.42]  Which they tried to blame
[10872.42 --> 10872.76]  That
[10872.76 --> 10873.74]  They tried to blame
[10873.74 --> 10874.84]  The the separation
[10874.84 --> 10875.52]  On that
[10875.52 --> 10876.22]  But we were like
[10876.22 --> 10876.90]  No no
[10876.90 --> 10877.62]  There are completely
[10877.62 --> 10878.30]  Separate rooms
[10878.30 --> 10879.32]  That are also separating
[10879.32 --> 10879.88]  That ain't it
[10879.88 --> 10880.16]  Yeah
[10880.16 --> 10881.20]  Um anyway
[10881.20 --> 10881.76]  So it was like
[10881.76 --> 10882.20]  Rippling
[10882.20 --> 10883.18]  And we didn't realize
[10883.18 --> 10884.04]  Until it had like
[10884.04 --> 10885.08]  Come up in between
[10885.08 --> 10885.40]  The things
[10885.40 --> 10886.30]  Because the leak
[10886.30 --> 10887.02]  Was really slow
[10887.02 --> 10888.04]  Um
[10888.04 --> 10890.14]  As it turns out
[10890.14 --> 10890.80]  The problem
[10890.80 --> 10891.74]  Was not that
[10891.74 --> 10892.66]  The AC unit
[10892.66 --> 10893.38]  Was leaking
[10893.38 --> 10893.76]  Because you know
[10893.76 --> 10894.14]  How they
[10894.14 --> 10895.22]  Collects condensation
[10895.22 --> 10895.54]  Right
[10895.54 --> 10896.22]  And it has to
[10896.22 --> 10896.86]  Drain it somehow
[10896.86 --> 10898.66]  Well that was all fine
[10898.66 --> 10899.30]  That's what I thought
[10899.30 --> 10899.78]  Was the problem
[10899.78 --> 10900.26]  But I kept
[10900.26 --> 10901.24]  I checked those units
[10901.24 --> 10901.88]  Over and over
[10901.88 --> 10902.72]  And over and over again
[10902.72 --> 10903.58]  They weren't leaking
[10903.58 --> 10905.02]  But the volume of water
[10905.02 --> 10905.58]  Coming through
[10905.58 --> 10907.12]  Was obviously substantial
[10907.12 --> 10908.96]  Do you know what it was?
[10909.60 --> 10911.44]  It was the main bathroom shower
[10911.44 --> 10913.80]  Oh
[10913.80 --> 10915.14]  Do you know why we never noticed?
[10917.46 --> 10919.18]  Because only Yvonne showers
[10919.18 --> 10920.08]  I bath
[10920.08 --> 10921.26]  So
[10921.26 --> 10922.76]  It was a micro
[10922.76 --> 10924.16]  Fracture
[10924.16 --> 10925.08]  In
[10925.08 --> 10926.08]  Like a
[10926.08 --> 10926.48]  In a
[10926.48 --> 10927.04]  In an L
[10927.04 --> 10927.90]  In an elbow
[10927.90 --> 10929.42]  Like a PVC elbow
[10929.42 --> 10931.50]  And as long as
[10931.50 --> 10931.86]  It was
[10931.86 --> 10932.88]  One shower
[10932.88 --> 10933.76]  Once in a while
[10933.76 --> 10935.60]  It didn't leak enough
[10935.60 --> 10937.06]  To cause any kind of problem
[10937.06 --> 10938.84]  Like a few drops
[10938.84 --> 10939.30]  Or whatever
[10939.30 --> 10940.16]  It will eventually
[10940.16 --> 10942.28]  Make its way
[10942.28 --> 10942.64]  Yeah
[10942.64 --> 10942.98]  Away
[10942.98 --> 10943.92]  And it'll dry
[10943.92 --> 10944.32]  Or whatever
[10944.32 --> 10945.24]  Even inside a wall
[10945.24 --> 10945.78]  Yeah
[10945.78 --> 10947.12]  But now that the AC
[10947.12 --> 10948.70]  Was running continuously
[10948.70 --> 10951.20]  It revealed
[10951.20 --> 10952.06]  A flaw
[10952.06 --> 10953.06]  That had actually
[10953.06 --> 10953.92]  Probably been there
[10953.92 --> 10954.54]  For years
[10954.54 --> 10954.88]  Yeah
[10954.88 --> 10956.18]  Okay so there
[10956.18 --> 10956.72]  Is that enough
[10956.72 --> 10957.62]  Horror stories from you?
[10958.36 --> 10958.88]  Homeownership
[10958.88 --> 10959.92]  Do be like that though
[10959.92 --> 10960.76]  It kinda sucks
[10960.76 --> 10963.82]  Don't be down on baths
[10963.82 --> 10965.26]  What
[10965.26 --> 10966.28]  The
[10966.28 --> 10967.80]  Is wrong with
[10967.80 --> 10968.86]  Having a bath?
[10968.86 --> 10969.82]  I take
[10969.82 --> 10970.38]  I take
[10970.38 --> 10970.80]  I take
[10970.80 --> 10970.86]  I take
[10970.86 --> 10971.96]  A different type of bath
[10971.96 --> 10972.92]  But I take baths
[10972.92 --> 10973.24]  Yeah
[10973.24 --> 10974.60]  I mean your bath
[10974.60 --> 10975.34]  Is more manly
[10975.34 --> 10975.88]  Than my bath
[10975.88 --> 10977.08]  I got the scented candles
[10977.08 --> 10977.82]  Up in there
[10977.82 --> 10978.84]  I got the chocolates
[10978.84 --> 10980.12]  On the side
[10980.12 --> 10980.94]  Yeah
[10980.94 --> 10981.92]  I take a bath
[10981.92 --> 10982.28]  Look
[10982.28 --> 10983.56]  Man when I
[10983.56 --> 10984.92]  Especially when I exercise
[10984.92 --> 10986.12]  I need a bath
[10986.12 --> 10987.48]  Like
[10987.48 --> 10988.78]  The heat man
[10988.78 --> 10989.48]  It's good
[10989.48 --> 10990.54]  It's good for the muscles
[10990.54 --> 10991.08]  Yeah
[10991.08 --> 10992.44]  It's good for the muscles
[10992.44 --> 10994.94]  Okay
[10994.94 --> 10995.68]  This next one
[10995.68 --> 10996.18]  Everyone saying
[10996.18 --> 10997.40]  Dual shower is a lie
[10997.40 --> 11002.32]  uh neo cho n says i thought you said that uh you and yvonne shower together to talk over stuff
[11002.32 --> 11009.02]  yeah we used to shower together a lot more that was back in the day and we still we still do when
[11009.02 --> 11015.82]  i don't when i like didn't exercise but i man like at least every other day um like i okay i you know
[11015.82 --> 11021.86]  i'm gonna out myself here i'm not like an everyday shower or bather there's also in my opinion there
[11021.86 --> 11027.90]  are certain levels of gross that you can be after doing like certain amounts of whatever activity
[11027.90 --> 11032.90]  that i will i will just go through the full shower cycle just like twice if i'm having a shower
[11032.90 --> 11039.14]  because i'm like this is just this needs more than one pass and if you take a bath you can kind of
[11039.14 --> 11044.10]  just deal with it which is nice i don't know i'm not down on baths but yeah so uh we do use the
[11044.10 --> 11049.30]  shower occasionally but we were we were not using it a lot in the lead up to the ac thing and honestly
[11049.30 --> 11054.38]  i haven't used it much at the uh at the new place i would bath significantly more if i fit
[11054.38 --> 11062.80]  um i don't i don't even like remotely fit in in my bathtub so i i only use it for for cold stuff
[11062.80 --> 11067.80]  i'm not a once a week bather either though anytime i exercise i'll bathe and that's usually every other
[11067.80 --> 11073.96]  day so like i i have very few opportunities to take a shower like if i need to like quickly
[11073.96 --> 11076.30]  clean up yeah obviously i'll jump in the shower
[11076.30 --> 11085.36]  okay got another one here from jamie uh linus if you were stuck on an island what's the one thing
[11085.36 --> 11094.06]  in your ltt backpack that will ensure your survival an ltt screwdriver i mean there's no one thing that's
[11094.06 --> 11099.54]  going to ensure your survival you're boned in what situation maybe a tent in what you're stranded on
[11099.54 --> 11104.88]  an island oh how about how about a sleeping how about a shelter there it could fit a decent size
[11104.88 --> 11109.54]  your backpack can fit a lot of stuff yeah but he said i only get one thing in the you only get one
[11109.54 --> 11117.76]  thing in the backpack that's it oh wow yeah okay got another one here from tong uh got my first tech
[11117.76 --> 11124.08]  job paycheck today and the first thing i bought was ltt merch are you proud of me not necessarily
[11124.08 --> 11131.22]  as a big fan of open source software does floatplane contribute to open source software projects or plan
[11131.22 --> 11137.84]  to open source anything some of them and yes i'd also know i i hold on i want to address the am i proud
[11137.84 --> 11151.06]  of you thing yet i i am an advocate for um for for for fiscal responsibility so if you had a good job
[11151.06 --> 11158.44]  before that and you know it it's just a career change or or whatever else and you like have
[11158.44 --> 11164.32]  plenty of money then by all means yeah i'm super proud of you for getting your first tech job paycheck
[11164.32 --> 11169.92]  but you should only spend money on stuff if if you can afford it you shouldn't just like take a check
[11169.92 --> 11176.32]  and just like immediately convert it into stuff so if it was financially no problem yeah then love it
[11176.32 --> 11182.94]  yeah but if it was a stretch for you then i would i would like to see you take care of things like
[11182.94 --> 11192.04]  uh shelter and food and um and you know your your basics your basics first yeah we don't sell anything
[11192.04 --> 11198.70]  essential i think is is pretty fair to say i mean i think clothing is pretty essential and i think you
[11198.70 --> 11205.18]  we can justify the cost of the clothing just with how well it lasts but yeah um oh sorry
[11205.18 --> 11210.36]  that's luke's reminder to tell me that the show's been going on for far too long and we need to wrap
[11210.36 --> 11216.28]  it up that's not happening anytime soon let's go yeah i removed my bedtime alarms for a nice show
[11216.28 --> 11224.52]  next up's from matthew uh luke i love how you have shaped ltt and that you hired linus uh just spent
[11224.52 --> 11232.80]  1.5 hours on hold to set up an account for garbage uh what is the worst on hold call you've ever had or
[11232.80 --> 11239.36]  worst service call oh luke's got some stories all right i'm trying to even think i don't even
[11239.36 --> 11246.66]  remember who it was i know there's been some like data center stuff that's been brutal i i know that i
[11246.66 --> 11256.74]  have spent literally a day like not a working day like literally a whole day from the morning till
[11256.74 --> 11264.98]  night on hold but i'm trying to remember who it was and i don't remember uh linus i i used to be
[11264.98 --> 11271.62]  very against calling people i hated calling people and linus got me on the just call people thing yeah
[11271.62 --> 11277.16]  he'd be like they didn't reply to my email so there is simply no way for me to find an answer to this
[11277.16 --> 11283.42]  question like there's a phone number on their website or like a phone number in their email
[11283.42 --> 11289.36]  signature and now pick up a phone now i'm like almost too far the other way where i like i hate
[11289.36 --> 11293.94]  emailing if i have the possibility of just calling people like i could just get this done faster i
[11293.94 --> 11299.36]  could i could get an answer immediately or i could just wait around and see if my message got lost in
[11299.36 --> 11307.84]  the ether oh obviously yeah let's go there's also a big problem yeah with read receipts and like modern
[11307.84 --> 11313.40]  messaging stuff for sure where it's i really can't trust if someone actually read it or not even if it's
[11313.40 --> 11318.10]  says that they read it if it's an automatic thing and they didn't react to it i don't trust that they
[11318.10 --> 11321.50]  actually read it yeah because it might have just been opened on their phone and they didn't mean to
[11321.50 --> 11327.40]  um there was something very very recently that i am 100 not going to go into details of but i told you
[11327.40 --> 11332.40]  about where i was just like harassing people on the phone until i got far enough into the chain and
[11332.40 --> 11339.18]  then i finally got what i needed it worked it works it was not going to work any other way nope um spent a
[11339.18 --> 11344.70]  lot of time on the phone there i don't know i i don't have a specific one uh but i have i know
[11344.70 --> 11349.66]  that i have looked at my phone that was plugged in because it would like ran out of battery because
[11349.66 --> 11356.16]  it's on the phone for so long on a hold timer or uh i don't know if it was on hold but it's like
[11356.16 --> 11362.38]  the next whatever is waiting for you that was over eight hours long wow i have seen that before
[11362.38 --> 11370.54]  and then when they finally went to go like pick it up something happened and it disconnected and i had
[11370.54 --> 11376.08]  to call them and wait through the entire queue again it didn't resume that's wild companies that
[11376.08 --> 11383.90]  have call-in lines like that really have to do the callback thing yeah you're in queue do you want us
[11383.90 --> 11388.78]  to call you back when you're up yes you press the button it hangs up they call you when you're and
[11388.78 --> 11399.82]  failing that they need to not have any human voice in the hold music yes that pisses me off yeah like
[11400.86 --> 11405.90]  did you know that our whatever whatever hours of operation are this and this to this oh is that a
[11407.02 --> 11416.94]  still because at least if i can just put it next to me and completely space out that's all right fine
[11416.94 --> 11423.90]  not great but it's acceptable yeah yeah thank god you don't have minutes yeah yeah yeah it's not
[11423.90 --> 11431.42]  it's not my plan anyways get owned linus yeah chat's loving this hey how's it going we're still on hold
[11431.42 --> 11436.30]  yeah see you later hope you're having a great day incredibly annoying especially once once you're more
[11436.30 --> 11443.34]  than like five minutes deep if you're two hours into waiting like i don't want to pay attention to this
[11443.34 --> 11448.94]  yes play the stupid hold music constantly so that i know the line hasn't dropped or whatever else
[11448.94 --> 11452.86]  i'll put it on whatever volume i need to not really care that much and the second that
[11453.42 --> 11456.06]  stops for whatever reason i want to pick it up and have someone be there
[11457.42 --> 11464.38]  yeah next up this one's from a different matthew long time fan here i don't think i've seen either of
[11464.38 --> 11471.42]  you talk about lobe or ai ghosts before on when do you have any thoughts on this phenomenon um i would
[11471.42 --> 11476.94]  be careful googling this i did that earlier and it's good that i don't personally find it that
[11476.94 --> 11485.18]  interesting um i'd never heard of this before it's very spooky i don't know it kind of has like a slender
[11485.18 --> 11492.62]  man kind of vibe that's what i feel like too it's kind of uh i don't know it's just yeah yeah all right
[11492.62 --> 11498.22]  i don't personally find it that interesting moving on next one's from cory hi guys in the labs your
[11498.22 --> 11505.18]  video your video you commented how it was supposed how it wasn't making any revenue yet in the labs
[11505.18 --> 11512.22]  video you commented how it wasn't making any revenue yet yes how will it or the new site make revenue
[11512.22 --> 11520.14]  by supporting videos or will the new site have some form of subscription yes um affiliate revenue
[11520.14 --> 11528.46]  subscriptions maybe um helping us produce better content on the video channels helping us launch
[11528.46 --> 11532.54]  more video channels i think some of it's going to be a little bit intangible yeah i i'd love to see
[11532.54 --> 11540.70]  yeah i'd love to see um retailers uh license api access to our data for example to make their product
[11540.70 --> 11546.62]  pages more informative i don't know in the long term there's all kinds of ideas but only time will tell
[11546.62 --> 11554.22]  i know that it's going to be a competitive advantage to have this testing capacity that i know
[11555.42 --> 11561.50]  what we're competing for what we're going to win uh who we're competing against not sure
[11564.38 --> 11570.06]  yeah okay next one's from melissa one of my co-workers has an ltd water bottle and accidentally
[11570.06 --> 11576.38]  cooked it in our industrial oven did you know that it can withstand over 300 degrees for four hours
[11576.38 --> 11582.70]  with no damage at all even the lid was intact i would not recommend that the glass beading might
[11582.70 --> 11589.74]  also yeah the glass bead in the bottom um yeah 300 might not be enough to melt glass i don't know
[11589.74 --> 11597.58]  i don't know that's it doesn't say fahrenheit or celsius not my area of expertise okay well cool
[11597.58 --> 11603.90]  neat don't do that intentionally yeah please uh next one's from carlos love the backpack take to
[11603.90 --> 11610.06]  work every day and the tech pouch will be a great addition i can't wait for ltx if you can talk about
[11610.06 --> 11616.46]  it linus what creators have you spoken to about coming to ltx i haven't gotten an approved list yet
[11617.02 --> 11624.78]  um some of them are are you know even once we say they're coming stuff happens things come up last
[11624.78 --> 11630.14]  minute whether it's like creators their schedules are crazy yeah family responsibility or or a
[11630.14 --> 11635.50]  uh an impossible to say no to sponsor deal you know whatever you never know stuff happens you know
[11635.50 --> 11643.18]  life life is life is crazy um but what i've asked the team to do is check in with people and say hey can
[11643.18 --> 11648.38]  i at least say that you want to try to come and if you aren't able to make it no hard feelings or
[11648.38 --> 11653.90]  whatever but we want to at least be able to start to talk about people um and i'm not there yet soon
[11653.90 --> 11659.98]  apparently brett from ufd tech announced today that he's going to ltx okay i mean i didn't know but
[11659.98 --> 11665.42]  there you go um well someone in chat said it i don't know no one no one told me he was confirmed so
[11665.42 --> 11672.70]  i guess i guess creators might start talking about it on their own okay next up is his mom is definitely
[11672.70 --> 11680.22]  coming my dad is let's go uh next up is from riley hey linus do you have any plans for your company in
[11680.22 --> 11686.30]  terms of handing it down to your kids in the future if so can you share any ideas i wouldn't
[11686.30 --> 11691.66]  want it to just turn into nepotism central here i don't think that's healthy for the for the work
[11691.66 --> 11696.14]  environment um how would you go about employing one of them man
[11701.58 --> 11708.86]  see that's that's tough because i could imagine myself saying you know junior you're gonna start at
[11708.86 --> 11714.38]  the bottom and darn it you're gonna stay there until you you know prove yourself but i could also
[11714.38 --> 11719.90]  see myself kind of you know every parent wants to create an advantage for their children they want
[11719.90 --> 11727.42]  them to succeed right so you know if if my son or daughter came to me and was like uh you know dad
[11727.42 --> 11735.26]  i've got this great idea for a channel um i you'd want to give them a shot yeah yeah maybe i'd want to give
[11735.26 --> 11744.30]  them a shot at it you know like i but then there's there's a risk there right like where's the line
[11744.30 --> 11754.14]  between giving them a shot and you know essentially uh hiring people to to babysit them i always liked
[11754.14 --> 11760.46]  uh keep them out of my hair you know i've told these stories before but my dad was very often one of the
[11760.46 --> 11766.62]  coaches on a variety of sports teams that i played on and the initial reaction of all the kids on the
[11766.62 --> 11772.06]  team if they haven't played with you before is like oh this is going to be stupid because you're just
[11772.06 --> 11775.98]  going to get all the advantageous positions and you're going to get more play time than everyone
[11775.98 --> 11782.78]  and all this kind of stuff and within a couple weeks usually they had totally flipped and they were
[11782.78 --> 11788.62]  like oh man i'm like so sorry because my dad would be way harder on me than anybody else which was
[11788.62 --> 11795.66]  absolutely the way to go we agreed on it like there was i mean we agreed it's not like he was going to
[11795.66 --> 11800.14]  do it in any other way to be completely clear but like i agreed with him on it all this kind of stuff
[11800.14 --> 11804.70]  because i hated it when all the kids would be like oh like your dad's a coach you're gonna get
[11804.70 --> 11811.82]  everything handed to you i would rather earn it and then them respect me yeah so like i liked that
[11811.82 --> 11817.82]  the other one was um one time my brother reffed a hockey game that i was in and the other team
[11817.82 --> 11821.74]  thought it was gonna be bs and then i like hit somebody and my brother ran up to me and grabbed
[11821.74 --> 11827.74]  the back of my jersey and tossed me across the this is when he was like max jacked he literally
[11827.74 --> 11831.58]  threw me and i went like flying through the air uh and then everyone was like all right never mind
[11832.62 --> 11837.18]  i think it's fine um but yeah i don't know you i think you almost have to be
[11837.18 --> 11848.94]  like more watchful more harsh but then at the same time it's not like the point isn't to just like beat
[11848.94 --> 11853.50]  them into submission either that too yeah right like you want to you want to create an environment where
[11853.50 --> 11860.06]  they can do their best give them the opportunity but don't just like make them auto win i think yeah
[11860.06 --> 11867.50]  the way to go because they're like there's this whole thing where um where wealth survives a
[11867.50 --> 11871.98]  maximum of i think it's like three or four generations or something like that because
[11872.62 --> 11882.14]  what the the the the characteristics that create wealth are not perpetuated by being wealthy so it's
[11882.14 --> 11888.22]  like cyclical yeah um and so we got to figure out you know how to how to make our kids have the same
[11888.22 --> 11895.26]  characteristics that have made me and yvonne successful and it sure wasn't growing up with
[11895.26 --> 11903.42]  silver spoons in our mouths yeah yeah like our kids have it way easier than we did by a long shot we see
[11903.42 --> 11912.22]  it and we like don't know how to fix it because obviously you know we would like to enjoy our success
[11912.22 --> 11919.50]  a little you know i i don't i don't want to have a newspaper route after my full-time job during the
[11919.50 --> 11927.02]  day and have my kids fall asleep in the back of the car while i deliver papers or whatever um just so
[11927.02 --> 11935.42]  that they see that like because i just don't want to it's tough this has been a thing that's been very
[11935.42 --> 11941.02]  interesting to observe from the outside is like how you deal with that because i know all those concepts
[11941.02 --> 11945.10]  have always been very important to you yeah but then it's like
[11947.98 --> 11955.10]  what's the limit on not enjoying your own success and like what do you do just lie to your kids
[11956.14 --> 11962.78]  i don't we could just not leave the money we've talked about it yeah is there realistically a benefit
[11962.78 --> 11968.14]  in that i don't know are their lives actually better maybe i'm not saying like i'm not actually
[11968.14 --> 11971.98]  fighting the other side i'm just i don't know and and it's not even necessarily the kids that are
[11971.98 --> 11980.06]  the problem could be the grandkids like maybe our uh yeah i don't know yeah your inheritance is
[11980.06 --> 11990.30]  backpacks and screwdrivers good luck have fun yeah oh man you want another yeah all right this is an
[11990.30 --> 11997.98]  anonymous one hello and good weekend luke and linus is there being any progress on getting the official
[11997.98 --> 12005.02]  honeywell ptm 7950 thermal pad to ltt store a little bit you don't have to read the exact words you can
[12005.02 --> 12014.22]  like honeywell are all rights reserved um yes but we're not sure what it's going to look like yet i don't
[12014.22 --> 12018.14]  think we had any luck getting in touch with honeywell directly but i think we're in touch with a
[12018.14 --> 12023.66]  supplier so yeah we we'd love we'd love to carry it i think we're i think we're also chatting with the
[12023.66 --> 12028.46]  rack studs folks about carrying rack studs just like i don't know can the store just like good
[12028.46 --> 12035.66]  products i think so yeah i don't see why not this one's from uh sun air uh oh yeah we'll get the
[12035.66 --> 12039.66]  dimensions for the tech pouch at some point i yelled at nick and now they're on the website oh they are
[12039.66 --> 12047.74]  hey sorry i sent him a respectful professional message of course you did uh that's dan for you
[12047.74 --> 12060.14]  size guide got him nice um there we go enjoy okay uh i'm interested in the new tech pouch but i don't
[12060.14 --> 12065.02]  see dimensions yeah yeah yeah we already did that one they're there now let's go okay yeah sorry uh
[12065.02 --> 12070.54]  joseph uh linus have you upgraded the firmware on your z wave stick the 700 series has a bug which
[12070.54 --> 12075.82]  creates crazy amounts of traffic making the network unusable no any more home automation videos coming
[12075.82 --> 12080.46]  i wonder if that's part of my problem i haven't specifically done that i will have to look into that
[12081.18 --> 12086.46]  um more home automation videos coming yeah in undoubtedly at some point but not for a while
[12086.46 --> 12092.78]  i'm waiting on in a valley to release their new um millimeter wave presence detection switches
[12092.78 --> 12096.54]  hopefully that'll solve a lot of my problems so this is a float plane message actually but i want
[12096.54 --> 12102.62]  to address it someone mentioned uh after the goat video have you gained any traction with linus opening
[12102.62 --> 12110.14]  a land center so one of the problems there is that that wouldn't solve this particular problem because
[12110.14 --> 12117.98]  so many and we've talked about this too so many modern games don't support local play at all a lot of
[12117.98 --> 12123.66]  games are multiplayer only there's not very much like local scrimmage there's not very much co-op
[12123.66 --> 12127.98]  there's not as even as much single player i find there's a lot of multiplayer only games coming out
[12128.62 --> 12137.50]  and like tarkov for instance you can do something that is uh super privateery and you can there's like
[12137.50 --> 12144.86]  a single player version of it that you can acquire but it's like very not above board and that version
[12144.86 --> 12155.26]  doesn't support co-op and it's like definitely illegal so it's i don't know it doesn't really solve the problem
[12156.14 --> 12158.06]  with all of that said um
[12161.90 --> 12168.06]  i am planning to open up a badminton center so this is that's something i think i haven't really talked about yet
[12168.06 --> 12179.18]  um and it will be designed in such a way that it will be powered up and networked up and the goal
[12179.18 --> 12187.42]  is to make when up when whale land um a regular occurrence so we're talking about this vaguely yeah
[12187.42 --> 12193.58]  i think we've i think i've never really just come out and said it um progress is excellent on on the
[12193.58 --> 12204.06]  building and um first it is it is loaded for bear in terms of networking and power i think we'll be
[12204.06 --> 12211.66]  able to do 250 300 person lands there pretty easily and the requirements that i laid out for chase and
[12211.66 --> 12218.78]  anyone working on events is i want this thing pretty much um
[12218.78 --> 12228.14]  um pre-loaded onto pallets or you know like pretty much to the point where in three hours
[12228.14 --> 12233.82]  oh okay yeah we can roll it out so like set up and take down really fast i'm talking network switches
[12233.82 --> 12239.42]  for the tables that at the end of the event you just unplug them from the computers wrap them up
[12241.42 --> 12247.90]  stack them so when it's time to redeploy them you just go plonk plonk from the wall do you think you
[12247.90 --> 12251.66]  could have certain folding tables where it's like built into the table so you don't even have to you
[12251.66 --> 12256.06]  just unplug it and fold the table and put it away i mean maybe yeah i don't see why we couldn't we
[12256.06 --> 12261.58]  couldn't wire it up like that i mean basically i said look i i don't want it to interfere with our
[12261.58 --> 12268.46]  ability to run this place as a badminton center but if we book off times occasionally i would like this
[12268.46 --> 12274.38]  to be a quarter or something unroll roll back up about three hours i think is the goal that i set for them
[12274.38 --> 12279.10]  with uh with a handful of people and i think it's doable because the entire building is going to
[12279.10 --> 12283.50]  have all of the connection points for land and power to the point where if you've got just like
[12284.78 --> 12290.30]  a a couple of bins of these california standard like power breakout boxes and you
[12290.30 --> 12296.14]  you kind of roll them over you just go thunk thunk thunk well there's your power you've got just like
[12296.62 --> 12301.66]  uh you know like a big cart of tables you just kind of roll down the middle and go okay table table
[12301.66 --> 12305.66]  table table table if ever if you know what the layout is and you've kind of done it a few times
[12305.66 --> 12312.06]  i think we could get this down to the point where we could on a friday night say okay uh thanks for
[12312.06 --> 12316.30]  watching see you again next time same bad time same bad channel uh for those of you who are going to be
[12316.30 --> 12323.98]  at whale land we'll see you guys in half an hour that'd be sick and we just dude the after party comes
[12323.98 --> 12329.02]  back in a real big way yeah yeah i'm super excited that's another random thing i found
[12329.02 --> 12335.74]  uh the the overlay for the after party the gaming overlay yeah yeah apparently jake updated your z-wave
[12335.74 --> 12340.70]  stick by the way oh thanks jake yeah um legendary dust on float planes says honeywell is hard to get
[12340.70 --> 12344.86]  a hold of they won't return my emails and i'm trying to buy aircraft parts for the u.s air force
[12346.22 --> 12349.02]  oh my goodness okay then have they tried calling them
[12351.74 --> 12358.54]  i yeah i don't know it's a good question yeah very topical all right hit me uh this one's from brian
[12358.54 --> 12364.94]  long time viewer ltd store whale thanks for adding another item i have purchased now uh when will we
[12364.94 --> 12373.66]  see the rgb pc case pin back in stock i don't know limited thing i think that was part of the limited
[12373.66 --> 12379.10]  run the last time um the reason that we did it as a limited run was that we didn't get that one sampled
[12379.10 --> 12384.06]  and we were worried it would suck so we ordered very limited quantities of it it wasn't an intentional
[12384.06 --> 12390.38]  limited edition thing so with that in mind i don't see why we wouldn't restock it but i don't have any
[12390.38 --> 12398.38]  kind of eta on that you'd have to i don't know nick would know yeah that's his department okay next up
[12398.38 --> 12404.54]  is from lewis hi luke on a previous one show you mentioned you would make an make inverted chicken
[12404.54 --> 12408.14]  cordon bleu to impress people what kind of people luke
[12408.14 --> 12416.06]  isn't that just like ham and cheese on top of how many x chromosomes did they have of a chicken breast
[12417.90 --> 12424.62]  two um so in the yeah i would how successful was it luke actually extremely
[12427.58 --> 12436.46]  how do you define success i'm not going into that but i will say it was 100 successful uh and and it had a
[12436.46 --> 12445.34]  decent sample size um so it was chicken breast in a frying pan um a little bit of a little bit of
[12445.34 --> 12457.02]  olive oil you would put oh man it's been so long okay basil on top of the chicken breast with uh prosciutto
[12457.02 --> 12466.38]  ham on top of that and then provolone cheese on top of that and you would try you the difficulty
[12466.38 --> 12471.42]  was keeping it all together so part of the reason why this was successful is because it was visually
[12471.42 --> 12478.30]  interesting so you could keep them entertained um so you need to let the basil sit there for a second
[12478.30 --> 12483.34]  so it kind of cook in and then when you put the ham on you wanted to kind of press it around the
[12483.34 --> 12487.58]  perimeter of the chicken so it would kind of sear into the chicken slightly so that it would hold
[12487.58 --> 12493.66]  together and then you need to use two spatulas to flip it over once you put the cheese on so you
[12493.66 --> 12499.58]  could cook the cheese on the top as well and then it was basically chicken corn on blue just
[12500.86 --> 12506.78]  not inside it's on top so we call that inverted it was great and very successful you say yeah
[12509.98 --> 12512.86]  i don't want to know you do know
[12515.10 --> 12518.30]  oh god everyone knows your mom knows yeah
[12518.30 --> 12524.46]  yeah this wasn't a secret everyone's young at a certain point in time and they're they're
[12524.46 --> 12529.50]  they're on the market nope i was never young i am now happily off the market this is not a problem
[12529.50 --> 12537.02]  i was never young yeah i've always been old and boring i gotta talk to my mom oh no um all right
[12537.02 --> 12543.58]  this next one's from greg uh hey linus my company works with the fireworks uh they're happening again this
[12543.58 --> 12548.38]  year the same weekend as ltx thought you'd want to consider giving people a heads up saturday
[12548.38 --> 12555.10]  downtown will suck plan ahead oh yeah good point oh i would hope by the time we're rolling around
[12555.10 --> 12559.26]  to fireworks time everyone who's going to be at the byoc would already be there the whale land could like
[12559.26 --> 12563.90]  step out and watch the fireworks for a second and then go back inside i don't think it'd be for a
[12563.90 --> 12567.74]  second though because if you need to be on like spanish banks or whatever to see them i don't think it's
[12567.74 --> 12574.54]  gonna be that close okay i don't know where they were yeah all right this next one's from aj lmg
[12574.54 --> 12579.82]  holds a lot of valuable parts and you often joke about taking stuff from the office during extreme
[12579.82 --> 12587.02]  upgrades has anything really valuable gone missing or has anyone anonymously been caught doing that uh
[12587.02 --> 12593.50]  the pippin x mark console disappeared yes i don't know what happened to it i genuinely do not have it
[12593.50 --> 12599.34]  um also it actually sucks because that thing was really cool island luke this dvd that was not a
[12599.34 --> 12606.54]  part of work that is not inventory eight years eight years ago and i said hey um this is not only you
[12606.54 --> 12613.26]  know my favorite show but also um you know it's kind of rare and it has some sentimental value for me as
[12613.26 --> 12620.38]  well and uh could i please get it back once you're done watching it and not only um did i not get it back
[12620.38 --> 12626.14]  when he was done watching it i had to follow it up earlier this week and he was like no i don't have
[12626.14 --> 12631.02]  it but he was like oh maybe i do have it i said i would look for it and then he found it and now i
[12631.02 --> 12635.82]  finally got it back and i consider that to be a long enough time period that it's completely unacceptable
[12635.82 --> 12643.34]  he stole it essentially he stole it and waited for me to forget oh pippin at mark sorry did i say x mark
[12643.34 --> 12649.10]  sorry pippin is correct that that is a true story i did just get this back from him right before the show
[12649.10 --> 12655.34]  today i don't think necessary and i did lend it to him eight years ago are perfect though the main ones
[12655.34 --> 12661.58]  the main ones by the way this is a great show it's streaming on cbc gem um it's very funny
[12666.14 --> 12671.74]  okay i guess i got it where i worked parts were locked in an inventory cage or closets hint hint at luke
[12671.74 --> 12677.74]  yeah it would be a little unreasonable i think to do that here yeah i don't think it's realistic the
[12677.74 --> 12682.54]  the building is that inventory and we have good people here yeah like we've actually had
[12682.54 --> 12686.54]  shockingly little go missing over the years i wouldn't even be surprised if we found that stupid
[12686.54 --> 12692.38]  app marks lying around somewhere at some point i'm just not to worry about it where it would even be
[12692.38 --> 12699.18]  i don't know kind of sucks because they're not like it could have been thrown away the server that
[12699.18 --> 12705.10]  we used for 10 gamers one cpu got accidentally thrown away which i was extremely angry about it
[12705.10 --> 12712.70]  wasn't stolen it was just it was it was chucked into the like the outside um uh that trailer that
[12712.70 --> 12719.18]  we used for like hauling junk to the dump and i found it in there completely like destroyed oh my god
[12719.18 --> 12724.86]  and i was like what the actual happened here because it was worth thousands of dollars right and
[12725.42 --> 12729.74]  some miscommunication had taken place and it got thrown away oh my god yeah
[12729.74 --> 12739.02]  that hurts okay this next one's from another anonymous uh where did the wan show intro animation
[12739.02 --> 12746.14]  come from ed made it yeah oh wow he's made all of them as far as i know and uh the last of the
[12746.14 --> 12751.26]  curated i have is from brian hey linus and luke have you ever considered open sourcing any of the
[12751.26 --> 12761.50]  software projects for float plane and labs we just talked about this um tbd yeah yeah tbd okay we've
[12761.50 --> 12766.78]  got a few potentials i'll have a look at these yeah go through it um what's y'all's favorite non-canadian
[12766.78 --> 12774.14]  food asks eduardo favorite non-canadian i mean oh man pretty much all of my favorite foods are not like
[12774.14 --> 12780.06]  what the hell's canadian food we really have is like poutine yeah it's stupid and like half the time you
[12780.06 --> 12784.86]  get poutine here it's not made right like it yeah it's it's too the gravy is too cold to melt the
[12784.86 --> 12789.98]  cheese and you're sitting here going this is basic it's got i don't know man like curry like any kind
[12789.98 --> 12797.66]  of like malaysian curry or like like yeah southeast asian curry indian curry i love curry like burritos
[12797.66 --> 12804.06]  give me a burrito any day i love nachos man authentic mexican every time i go down to la like the first
[12804.06 --> 12808.22]  thing i do is find some hole in the wall mexican restaurant now because
[12809.42 --> 12816.94]  so good yeah so good yeah we have we have some mexican places up here most of them are like fast
[12816.94 --> 12823.26]  food style like chipotle style no which is not really going to be it yeah and the like one or two
[12823.26 --> 12829.26]  sit downs that we have really they suck they are no offense not on the same level at all yeah you could
[12829.26 --> 12836.94]  go to any like just random mexican place in like la it's like it's the same as uh it's the same as
[12836.94 --> 12843.02]  how you can get you know indian food in vancouver and it's like overpriced and it's fusion and blah blah
[12843.02 --> 12851.10]  blah uh or you can get indian food in surrey where there's a huge community yeah and it's like it's cheap
[12851.10 --> 12856.62]  and plentiful and delicious yeah you're just like yeah because that's where the people who eat this all the
[12856.62 --> 12862.22]  time and actually know what it's supposed to taste like are yeah so yeah yeah it really it really
[12862.22 --> 12871.18]  depends yep all right i'm supposed i'm doing this now now it's your job uh okay so now i just if i hit
[12871.50 --> 12875.42]  reject does it go back okay if someone can clear them from the reject pile after i press that then
[12875.42 --> 12880.54]  that would be cool um luke what would you say gives you the most fulfillment in your professional life
[12880.54 --> 12887.58]  asks luke oh wait it's not oh it's for both of us from luke i thought it was to luke sure well cool
[12888.22 --> 12897.58]  uh it's not that easy is it i've had a really fun time um as my team has expanded and the things that
[12897.58 --> 12906.46]  we work on have expanded i've really liked i don't know i like making things that people use
[12906.46 --> 12912.14]  yeah and like no i'm not directly making it but i like working with a team who makes things that
[12912.14 --> 12917.74]  people use so like i like that internal people use the inventory system yeah i like that linus media
[12917.74 --> 12923.74]  group is the you know the largest member of float plane and we use the platform i like that people
[12924.70 --> 12928.94]  are going to be using the labs website i like that people use blah blah blah blah and i like that
[12928.94 --> 12934.46]  the path that we're going on is more of that yeah i've always liked that one of the reasons why
[12934.46 --> 12940.70]  when i first got into software engineering i wanted to work with uh i wanted to make like
[12940.70 --> 12945.10]  controller boards and stuff like that was because like people are literally going to literally use
[12945.10 --> 12950.22]  this thing yeah and i think that's cool uh so i've always liked that i think that's probably mine
[12950.22 --> 12960.30]  yeah i think that's um i think that combined with seeing people follow um not follow because they
[12960.30 --> 12964.78]  they take completely different paths from me but seeing people be inspired by what we do and get
[12964.78 --> 12972.30]  into computer engineering software engineering um electronics engineering uh like seeing what we're
[12972.30 --> 12977.66]  doing just like sharing this love of it create a new generation of people who are going to pursue
[12978.30 --> 12984.70]  these career paths and create the the next the next wave of cool technology for us to geek out over is
[12984.70 --> 12990.86]  i i i love that it's kind of a perpetual motion machine what what we're making um definitely yeah
[12991.50 --> 12996.94]  it's a good one uh michael says been waiting on these shirts also i really enjoy watching some of
[12996.94 --> 13001.82]  the more thematic artistic builds like the nerdforge pc do you have a favorite well the nerdforge pc
