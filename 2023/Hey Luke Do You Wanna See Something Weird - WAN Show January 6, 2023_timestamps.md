[2023-01-07T23:18:27Z] Video: Hey Luke Do You Wanna See Something Weird? - WAN Show January 6, 2023 
Hi, havent seen the whol show but on timestamp 20:25 response times of 2 nano seconds are mentioned for the new display tech. Im interested how they got it to respond faster than the speed of light^^ in two nanoseconds light travels about 60cm (lenght = speed of light * time = 2.998*10^10 cm/s * 2ns) :), maybe they refer to the switching time between 60% on to 30% on? not shure what standart for switching time is used today?
