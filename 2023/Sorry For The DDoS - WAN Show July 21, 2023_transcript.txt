[0.00 --> 5.48]  What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show
[6.40 --> 8.48]  Hype hype hype hype hype
[8.48 --> 13.70]  Nvidia will not make their own version of the 16 gig RTX 4060 Ti
[14.44 --> 17.78]  Probably because it sucks in other
[20.36 --> 25.32]  Sorry, sorry, we have no way of knowing that because they're apparently not sending out review samples
[25.32 --> 31.02]  Because it sucks in other news glorbo has come to world of Warcraft
[31.02 --> 33.66]  This is the best news I've heard in a long time
[33.66 --> 39.32]  This is actually really funny and I promise you it's not just gonna be Luke talking about AI for 45 minutes
[39.50 --> 43.70]  Yeah, only like 10. Yeah, but it's really funny. Yes. What else we got?
[44.26 --> 52.12]  The US government creates new security certain. No, that's not the one I meant to read proposed legislation requires platforms to snitch on users
[52.12 --> 55.68]  This is actually like a pretty big deal if it goes all the way through
[55.68 --> 59.16]  But as far as my understanding goes it has a ways to go so we should step on it now
[59.78 --> 65.52]  Other than that we're gonna talk about some water cooling builds really build of the month is apparently a thing now
[65.52 --> 69.48]  What introducing new like meta cancels the quest pro. Oh
[71.06 --> 72.50]  basically just
[72.50 --> 76.60]  Throws in the towel see you later. Yeah, that's kind of a big rip. Yeah, exactly
[77.12 --> 81.58]  Corsair buys drop. Yeah, I don't really care about that. You know, that's me right
[82.12 --> 86.68]  What oh, yeah, no, it's it's not it's not lion's meaty group sold the corsair
[88.80 --> 90.80]  Terran's going back
[90.80 --> 99.48]  Wow
[99.48 --> 111.48]  The show is brought to you today by Google and YouTube shopping secret lab and kudos
[111.48 --> 118.16]  Why don't we jump right into our headline topic the accidental DDoS?
[118.16 --> 120.16]  Yeah, we probably should have mentioned that of
[121.44 --> 127.46]  Where'd that where'd that go? Where did it go? Where did that go? It's not a headline topic. Yeah, what?
[128.16 --> 131.16]  I I'm so confused right now
[131.16 --> 135.72]  Um, um, um, um, here it is
[135.72 --> 139.58]  Whoops LTT accidentally DDoS to MediCat USB
[139.72 --> 143.46]  Too many people took us up on the title of our recent video
[143.82 --> 148.72]  Download these handy tools now and it took down the MediCat USB site and
[149.68 --> 154.94]  That's apparently all there is to say about it. We have a picture of the temporary page that they put up
[154.94 --> 162.94]  Um, where they were kind of redirecting people to the discord or to a direct file download and there's a
[163.26 --> 168.14]  Discussion question. How many times have we recommended a service and accidentally swamped their servers quite a few?
[168.78 --> 174.22]  Yeah, I think one of the earliest love hugs we ever gave to anyone. Okay. Where is this?
[175.18 --> 180.16]  Oh, it's above new. Do I have an old version of the doc or something? It's absolutely crazy. Okay. I found it
[180.16 --> 184.62]  Hey, this is awesome. So here's the temp page that was that was showing up on their site
[185.74 --> 190.36]  The site is currently having major issues due to the recent uncle Linus video
[190.50 --> 194.58]  Please bear with us as we panic and update our server. Oh
[195.64 --> 197.64]  No
[197.64 --> 206.40]  Brutal, I think one of the earliest love hugs that we ever gave was actually to Noctua and this was way back when we were in the Langley house
[206.40 --> 211.94]  Yeah, I know that we've accidentally taken down like small software projects quite a few times
[211.94 --> 215.22]  Uh for those of you who are new to medicat
[215.22 --> 221.20]  This is one of the tools that we featured in our in our handy useful tool roundup earlier this week
[221.20 --> 226.10]  But there's some really good stuff in here password removal tools backup and data recovery
[226.10 --> 231.42]  All that kind of cool stuff and of course you do not have to you know
[231.66 --> 236.62]  Buy a you know this tool will we hugged it again fix what already?
[237.90 --> 238.86]  Oh crap
[238.86 --> 242.04]  It's still sort of working. Oh no
[242.04 --> 247.28]  Okay, well they there's a lot of really cool tools and it's not one of those
[247.70 --> 253.00]  You know advertised on Facebook a miracle, you know, whatever fix your computer things
[253.00 --> 255.26]  It's actually like chock-full pretty good stuff and
[256.10 --> 260.66]  Yeah, you can get a little bit more detail about it from the video we published earlier this week
[260.66 --> 264.32]  Because you sure as heck won't be going to this website right now to learn anything about it
[264.32 --> 267.76]  So maybe set a calendar reminder to go back good job you guys
[267.76 --> 272.54]  Maybe maybe the rest of the community can remember times that we have accidentally love hugged people
[272.54 --> 278.28]  You know hugged a little harder. I even saw that they they they said they were like they beefed it up
[278.28 --> 280.62]  Which is why I thought we'd talk about it on when show
[280.62 --> 281.78]  I
[281.78 --> 283.66]  expected it to be a little bit beefier this time
[283.66 --> 290.32]  The truth is though that this sort of thing is very very difficult to account for right
[290.32 --> 297.48]  That was why I wanted to talk about this because it used to happen on the LTT forum for example on a fairly regular
[297.64 --> 304.08]  basis and and floatplane as well where we would have a sudden inrush of users from something like a
[304.68 --> 311.88]  Launch of a Christmas album for example or a live stream of an event like the roast of me
[312.22 --> 318.80]  Where we held up for the roast we we did but it was very challenging and we had lots of advance notice. It wasn't work
[318.80 --> 322.00]  Yeah, it wasn't the kind of thing where you can just have people suddenly
[322.68 --> 328.78]  You know come on to your site at 2x or 5x or 10x the volume and you can just
[329.34 --> 331.68]  Live through it. Oh, apparently we took down rack studs
[332.30 --> 338.36]  Yeah, that was one of them. There's been a ton that we're not necessarily gonna remember because they happened in that like, you know
[338.36 --> 339.86]  years ago kind of range
[340.58 --> 341.58]  but yeah
[341.58 --> 345.98]  Yeah, I remember taking down racks does super cool product. Is there anyone else?
[345.98 --> 348.98]  Come on guys help me out here help me out here
[348.98 --> 352.60]  Do you want to talk a little bit about you know what it takes?
[353.22 --> 360.96]  To put mitigations in place or something like that because I think a lot of people just assume like it's cuz you're cheap or something like that
[361.50 --> 368.24]  Well, okay certain degree sometimes yes, but also but there's also a range to being cheap because if you're like
[368.24 --> 375.40]  I'm not cheap. I'm just gonna put the blank check on AWS or whatever else like oh, yeah, they'll absorb it
[375.40 --> 378.20]  Well, I'll make sure you're okay, but it might cost you an arm and a leg
[378.48 --> 379.24]  so
[379.24 --> 385.18]  Oftentimes it's a good idea to to partner with like a range of different solutions right now for the forum and flow plane
[385.18 --> 395.06]  We have kind of a doubling where we have DDoS protections from our server hosts and we also have DDoS protections on top of that from cloudflare as well
[395.06 --> 398.74]  And that doubling has been very good for us. That's been going pretty well
[399.14 --> 404.58]  We also have redundancies in place and a lot of different situations. So if something does get effectively like brought down
[404.58 --> 408.80]  It should be okay because something else can can auto balance and pick it back up
[408.80 --> 414.44]  I've got some other good ones ventoi was apparently having issues after the recent software video as well
[415.08 --> 417.08]  shadow shadow PC
[417.44 --> 425.00]  Yeah, apparently went down the the remote gaming service the USB tester or they were OVH owned. I think so
[425.00 --> 431.36]  Yeah, yeah, the USB tester that we featured on handy tech sold out in less than two hours after the video
[434.52 --> 437.24]  Man, thanks guys. That's all that's all just recent stuff
[438.80 --> 440.80]  Yeah, oh oh
[440.80 --> 446.74]  Windows 9 I think had a bunch of issues. I was pretty sure Windows 9. Yeah after after we made our video about it
[447.62 --> 450.42]  Yeah, if like if you're trying to do like all of it yourself
[451.10 --> 458.64]  It's gonna be pretty hard. Oh Puget systems apparently had issues. Yeah, it's I mean it's re it's really challenging even even at
[458.90 --> 461.28]  Even with our team size being what it is
[462.42 --> 464.92]  Occasionally we will have things happen that are like
[464.92 --> 469.92]  Oops, that's that's a lot of load and it can it can be really challenging and it's not easy
[469.92 --> 473.60]  Our team size is hyper small for the services that we support
[473.60 --> 476.46]  It's it's not easy to to
[477.02 --> 482.28]  Achieve scale like we've talked a fair bit in the last few weeks about how easy it is to make Twitter
[482.28 --> 484.86]  Yeah, and the like base portion of Twitter is
[485.42 --> 492.60]  Super easy to make but making it so that it's available to hundreds of millions of users is is like the whole complication and it is a
[492.60 --> 498.52]  a lot of complication like it's not something that should be brushed over but just being able to do the
[498.86 --> 503.36]  Just the like user kind of side of of something like Twitter would not be that hard
[504.18 --> 506.18]  it's back a
[506.80 --> 512.86]  Now cloudflare protected temp page. Yep, so apparently they were ready for the WAN show today
[512.86 --> 516.36]  So that's that's good. Hey, good job everyone. All right
[516.36 --> 522.06]  Why don't we move into what I think is probably the other big news for this week and that's that Nvidia will not
[522.60 --> 525.86]  Be making their own version of the 4060 ti
[525.86 --> 531.64]  16 gig after launching founders edition cards for the 4060
[531.64 --> 534.52]  ti and then actually come to think of it
[534.52 --> 538.52]  I don't think they did do a founders edition for the regular 4060
[538.52 --> 543.42]  Oh, man. Oh now. I'm uh now i'm blanking on this. Yeah, I don't think so
[543.42 --> 546.68]  So after doing a founders edition of the 4060 ti
[546.68 --> 547.68]  8 gig
[547.68 --> 552.46]  They are not following that up with a founders edition of the 4060 ti
[552.46 --> 557.10]  16 gig the one that's supposed to come in a hundred dollars more expensive
[557.10 --> 561.18]  so the 4060 series has gotten really um
[562.38 --> 564.78]  I don't know what words to use complicated
[564.78 --> 570.44]  Alarming frustrating remember when a 60 class card was like
[570.44 --> 573.04]  200 high 300 low
[573.04 --> 579.04]  You know for a non ti and a ti. Yeah, this lineup starts at 300
[579.04 --> 585.58]  For one that is very cut down the 4060 is a lot slower than the 4060 ti
[585.58 --> 590.08]  um, like it's it's three quarters the price of the 4060 ti
[590.08 --> 594.68]  And barely even three quarters of the performance
[594.68 --> 601.68]  They both have eight gigs of ram. So then you step up another hundred dollars that gets you a 4060 ti
[601.68 --> 607.56]  A fully enabled chip, but still with only eight gigs of ram, which is going to be a limitation
[607.56 --> 611.98]  Today or if not today very soon
[612.92 --> 619.64]  Then if you want the fast chip and you want 16 gigs of ram they want five hundred us dollars
[620.84 --> 629.24]  So here's what's going on the 4060 ti is set to come out soon. However, nvidia has decided against participating in the launch
[629.96 --> 637.48]  Apart from overseeing the testing process and regulating when reviewers can publish their results. So basically they're going to provide a reviewer's
[637.48 --> 641.88]  Guide and an embargo and pretty much let their partners go to town
[642.92 --> 650.52]  Reportedly, they will not even produce or sell their own version of the 16 gig variant nor will they be providing review samples
[651.16 --> 652.44]  so
[652.44 --> 654.12]  that's a
[654.12 --> 657.00]  Sign of confidence in this product
[657.80 --> 664.84]  What's really baffling about this to me is that if they don't think that it's going to be successful, why don't they do something about it?
[665.48 --> 670.60]  I mean everyone already knows that 40 series other than a couple of key skews
[670.60 --> 677.08]  I think 4090 is moving well 4070 ti is moving well, but basically everything else is dead in the water
[678.52 --> 681.40]  Why not do something make the adjustments?
[681.56 --> 685.88]  I mean the nvidia of yesteryear would have put some aggressive game bundles on these like
[686.12 --> 690.20]  These things would come with like two or three triple-a games or something like that
[690.20 --> 695.16]  I mean, I guess that's that's harder in the age of everything free to play with micro transactions
[695.16 --> 695.96]  but like
[695.96 --> 697.56]  you know still
[697.56 --> 703.40]  What you know why hasn't the graphics card industry adapted to the modern the modern gaming economy?
[703.40 --> 707.96]  Then why doesn't it come with a hundred dollars in Diablo 4 bucks or?
[708.76 --> 713.96]  You know a 50 bucks in robux or like remember those bundles when you used to be able to pick what you wanted
[713.96 --> 719.08]  Yeah, why doesn't it come with a selector? I go to I go to a portal and I get a hundred bucks in you know
[719.08 --> 721.72]  Whatever bucks I might have spent make it a compelling value
[722.20 --> 727.16]  There is also a bunch of modern games that do cost money not a lot but money
[727.72 --> 731.00]  They're not like full fat like 80 triple-a games, but still
[731.48 --> 739.00]  uh, like crab champion and battle bit and stuff like that where there is there is a pay up front cost that could be included with these things doing like a
[739.00 --> 746.52]  more indie approach like you get crab champions and battle bit on a graphics card would actually probably work really well
[746.84 --> 751.96]  They're both very popular names right now. I could see that moving cards. This is just bizarre to me though
[752.04 --> 758.28]  Like instead of making the product line good. They're basically just going. Yeah, the one good one we have
[759.56 --> 761.56]  We know it's overpriced so
[763.40 --> 766.92]  We can't I mean we simply couldn't adjust the price
[767.56 --> 769.56]  But that's the thing they definitely
[770.92 --> 772.92]  100% could
[773.72 --> 775.72]  Because we already know
[776.12 --> 783.32]  Here hold on we can actually do the math on this all we got to do is go to DRAM exchange because everything else about this card is the same
[783.72 --> 789.80]  It's not like there's a completely different gpu core. So we're going oh well the yields for this core
[790.60 --> 792.60]  Could be very very different
[792.60 --> 795.40]  You know going from the 4060 to the 4060 ti you know
[795.40 --> 798.68]  Maybe there is a difference in cost that is is not publicly available
[799.16 --> 803.24]  But when it comes to ram it is this is a commodity product
[803.56 --> 805.24]  GDDR6
[805.24 --> 807.24]  Is at a spot price of
[807.64 --> 809.64]  Let's see um
[810.68 --> 814.68]  Session average of three dollars per eight gigabit
[815.24 --> 819.48]  Okay, so eight gigabit times eight is going to be gigabytes
[819.88 --> 828.36]  So it costs about at spot prices mind you nvidia is almost certainly paying less than spot prices about 25 dollars
[829.56 --> 830.52]  25 bucks
[831.16 --> 834.76]  So even if they were taking 50 points
[835.64 --> 839.48]  I always forget if it's points of margin or percent profit or whatever
[840.04 --> 846.76]  Even if they were charging double of the actual bill of materials cost to them for this higher
[847.32 --> 849.00]  memory capacity skew
[849.96 --> 852.44]  Then it would still be four hundred and fifty dollars
[853.00 --> 859.16]  Not five hundred dollars. This is literally the exact same product plus 25 bucks of DRAM
[859.16 --> 865.40]  But instead they're basically just going yeah rather than have a reasonable pricing scheme
[865.96 --> 871.08]  We'll just take our ball and go home and you will just not have a 16 gig card because that looks
[871.64 --> 873.64]  Kind of like how it's going to shake down
[873.64 --> 881.64]  Hardware unboxed has said that every nvidia partner that they spoke to so far has said they will not be providing review samples either
[882.28 --> 887.32]  Nor are they sure when their own cards will be available. This thing could not be lower priority
[887.32 --> 894.28]  I mean, okay, yeah, our notes here say it's possible that the 4060 ti 16 gigs
[894.52 --> 896.84]  recommended retail price of 500 dollars
[897.32 --> 903.96]  Being only a hundred dollars less than the 4070 has made many board partners skittish and that's absolutely
[904.84 --> 906.52]  True that makes a ton of sense
[907.08 --> 907.56]  um
[907.56 --> 910.52]  How on earth could they possibly hope to sell this thing?
[910.52 --> 915.40]  And one of the one of the real big challenges is that if you were to go all in and say yeah
[915.72 --> 921.16]  We think the 4060 ti is going to be a beast nvidia will take a whole bunch of chips. Let's go. Let's build these things
[922.12 --> 924.12]  um
[924.20 --> 931.72]  The fact that nvidia themselves is not going to be sitting on any inventory of it means that you could be basically out there on an island by yourself
[932.52 --> 935.24]  With no recourse no way to sell this thing
[935.32 --> 943.24]  You know, what's really confusing to me too is you look at all these modders out there that are just upgrading the vram on on gpus
[944.84 --> 947.48]  What exactly would prevent board partners from just
[948.28 --> 951.00]  putting 25 dollars worth of vram
[951.96 --> 952.92]  Onto a 4060
[953.80 --> 955.08]  8 gig
[955.08 --> 957.08]  Do you think there's some like uh
[957.16 --> 960.60]  Agreements there that they can't do something like that. Oh almost certainly, but
[960.60 --> 963.24]  I mean, okay riddle me this
[964.60 --> 965.56]  I'm msi
[966.12 --> 970.12]  I'm asus some gigabyte or you know, whoever i'm someone i'm someone other than evga
[973.88 --> 975.08]  I'm an nvidia partner
[976.04 --> 976.52]  I have
[976.52 --> 979.16]  a 4060 ti
[979.72 --> 980.92]  8 gig
[980.92 --> 984.20]  Okay, and it's a little bit above msrp
[984.76 --> 986.76]  It's like
[986.76 --> 988.44]  439.99
[988.44 --> 989.88]  something like that sure
[989.88 --> 990.28]  Okay
[990.92 --> 997.80]  You the customer take it and plug it into your system. You're like, yep. This is a 4060 ti 8 gig
[998.04 --> 1003.64]  I sure hope this core is overclocked a little bit because I paid more than msrp for this and then you go
[1004.52 --> 1007.96]  Hold on a second. What's this little switch on the card?
[1009.48 --> 1010.44]  Oh, that's funny
[1010.44 --> 1013.16]  It doubles the video memory
[1013.80 --> 1015.40]  Is this is this real?
[1016.60 --> 1018.04]  Or is this just fantasy?
[1019.48 --> 1020.28]  Oh, it's real
[1021.24 --> 1024.44]  Oh, wow. What a fantastic bonus
[1024.44 --> 1025.48]  I mean
[1025.48 --> 1026.76]  Would anything prevent that?
[1027.32 --> 1028.04]  I think so
[1028.04 --> 1031.80]  Because I think there could be agreement saying that you can't change the memory on the board
[1031.80 --> 1033.32]  Yeah, probably
[1033.32 --> 1035.16]  I just hate
[1035.16 --> 1036.04]  I just
[1036.04 --> 1038.20]  I just hate the way
[1038.20 --> 1038.76]  Yeah, wasn't it?
[1038.76 --> 1039.24]  That nvidia just
[1039.24 --> 1041.00]  controls everything
[1041.00 --> 1044.52]  I was gonna say I think it was last man show you're talking about how nvidia just loves control
[1044.52 --> 1046.12]  nvidia is a control company
[1046.12 --> 1048.76]  Yeah, I doubt they're gonna just let them be like oh
[1049.40 --> 1051.24]  We could just we could just double the ram
[1051.80 --> 1053.24]  That's fine
[1053.48 --> 1055.08]  It's probably not allowed
[1055.08 --> 1055.48]  um
[1056.12 --> 1060.84]  Shaft 2k says the 16 gig is a completely different board design due to the bus width
[1061.08 --> 1064.12]  I don't believe the bus width is any higher. I believe it's just
[1064.84 --> 1065.24]  um
[1066.20 --> 1070.76]  2d ram modules per whatever hold on a second 4060
[1070.76 --> 1074.68]  uh ti 16 gig bus width
[1074.92 --> 1080.44]  I could be wrong about that. It could be 256 bit, but I really don't think so because as far as I can tell that
[1080.68 --> 1081.24]  GPU
[1081.88 --> 1084.76]  So by gpu, I mean the core not the card
[1085.40 --> 1087.96]  Only supports on 128 bit memory bus
[1088.60 --> 1091.96]  Yeah, no, it's 128 bit. Yeah, they just they just double up the capacity
[1091.96 --> 1093.08]  In fact, you know, you know what?
[1093.08 --> 1096.68]  It's probably just denser chips because 8 gigs is not super high density these days
[1097.32 --> 1097.56]  um
[1098.36 --> 1101.24]  Because I was gonna say before maybe they've just doubled up the memory chips
[1101.24 --> 1105.88]  But no no what I suspect is that these are just higher density chips and it is literally the exact same thing
[1107.32 --> 1109.32]  Unbelievable
[1109.96 --> 1113.56]  What if board partners just added a physical slot to add more memory like the olden days?
[1113.96 --> 1115.96]  You know what we actually have a video coming
[1116.52 --> 1120.44]  That's very much about that even though I actually looking back on it
[1120.44 --> 1124.60]  I think we've done a bad job of the title and thumbnail because it's it's called um
[1124.60 --> 1126.60]  Um
[1126.60 --> 1128.60]  Starting at is the biggest lie in tech
[1129.32 --> 1134.28]  Like the starting at price and what we're what we're pretty much doing is taking a look at
[1135.24 --> 1141.48]  How manufacturers have manipulated starting at to make their systems in particular
[1141.48 --> 1145.40]  Seem like a much more appealing option than they really are
[1146.04 --> 1152.68]  When the only way to get them up to a reasonable spec that has enough memory and has enough storage
[1153.32 --> 1158.04]  Is to give the manufacturer an inordinate amount of money we do the math on this
[1158.52 --> 1161.32]  And I I forget I forget the exact numbers
[1161.32 --> 1168.36]  But I think apple is making something like 12 times the cost in margin on their ssd upgrades
[1168.76 --> 1170.28]  some of them like just
[1171.16 --> 1172.28]  ludicrous
[1172.28 --> 1173.72]  Unbelievable
[1173.72 --> 1177.16]  profit margins on these things and and dell was like better
[1177.56 --> 1180.28]  But not by much and we kind of dig into
[1180.92 --> 1183.24]  um, you know how the how the
[1183.24 --> 1187.24]  tightly integrated nature of modern system designs
[1187.24 --> 1194.76]  Makes this far more lucrative and far more possible for these system manufacturers because you no longer have the option
[1195.08 --> 1197.16]  Of just buying the base model today
[1197.96 --> 1202.92]  And then upgrading it down the line you either have to pay the ransom
[1204.20 --> 1206.60]  Extortionate price at launch
[1207.32 --> 1213.96]  Or you just don't have more ram or in some cases even more storage really you can't even change the storage
[1214.68 --> 1217.32]  However, there's two sides to every story, right?
[1217.88 --> 1224.44]  And there is a performance benefit to the way that they're doing things a real one not an imagined one
[1224.52 --> 1228.92]  And that's actually the the example that or the the illustration that I use for this is
[1229.64 --> 1231.64]  What happened with gpus like?
[1231.96 --> 1237.16]  Man this would have been like 25 almost like like 30 years ago a long time ago
[1237.56 --> 1243.72]  Uh, it it's a really good point that was brought up in the chat that gpus actually used to have expandable memory
[1244.12 --> 1250.60]  And this was in the form of like slots and and little like sockets that you could stick ram chips into and stuff like that
[1251.24 --> 1256.68]  And the reason that they didn't was because of the bandwidth requirements because of the performance requirements
[1257.24 --> 1263.96]  every time you add trace length and every time you add some kind of of pogo pin or
[1265.08 --> 1269.64]  lga or socketed interface you are adding
[1269.64 --> 1278.60]  Uh signal degradation and the more signal degradation you have the slower the speeds you have to run your memory at and for for gpus
[1279.32 --> 1283.48]  Then and now like gpus can basically never get enough memory bandwidth
[1283.48 --> 1290.84]  Which is a big part of why the 4060 series sucks so much because they're using only a 128 bit bus on what is purportedly a 60 class card
[1291.24 --> 1292.12]  um
[1292.12 --> 1296.20]  I forget where I was how I started this sentence the point is they they need tons of memory bandwidth
[1296.20 --> 1298.12]  they can never get enough and
[1299.40 --> 1306.04]  So the decision was made that you know given that there was probably going to be a fairly appropriate amount of memory
[1306.04 --> 1309.72]  Anyway, and by the time you needed more memory that gpu would be out of date
[1310.20 --> 1315.24]  Anyway, the decision was made to basically move forward with gpus always having soldered memory
[1315.24 --> 1323.24]  And those benefits do extend to modern systems for example in ddr5 you ever notice that you can't buy a ddr5 sodium
[1323.24 --> 1326.92]  That's faster than like 4800. Yeah, you can't
[1327.48 --> 1333.16]  But you can buy systems now that have ddr5 running in excess of 7000 mega transfers per second
[1334.20 --> 1337.88]  Asus has one where they actually are doing a similar on package
[1338.44 --> 1339.24]  um
[1339.24 --> 1344.04]  Memory chip similar to what apple's doing with their m-series silicon that runs at like
[1344.84 --> 1350.20]  7700 mega transfers per second or something like that and is only able to do that because the traces are like this long
[1352.28 --> 1358.04]  So I guess what i'm trying to say is that it's a little bit more complicated than
[1359.24 --> 1361.24]  manufacturer bad
[1362.28 --> 1363.88]  But also
[1363.88 --> 1369.16]  Manufacture bad yeah, because there is no similar argument for doing that with storage
[1369.88 --> 1374.12]  PCI express can run over distances like so and beyond
[1379.24 --> 1385.80]  Moving on rcdok asks why aren't cpus soldered to the motherboards then well in mobile devices
[1386.36 --> 1390.84]  They are although it's for different reasons one of the big reasons is that
[1391.88 --> 1396.20]  You are able to reduce the z height ever so slightly giving you thinner devices
[1396.20 --> 1402.28]  And perhaps more importantly more room for cooling mechanisms above the cpu which in
[1402.36 --> 1407.64]  Most mobile devices is the main heat generating component unless you also happen to have a gpu
[1408.20 --> 1408.60]  um
[1408.60 --> 1413.24]  As for why they continue to stick with socketed
[1413.96 --> 1415.48]  cpus and motherboards, I mean
[1416.68 --> 1418.68]  It always comes down to cost, doesn't it?
[1418.68 --> 1426.92]  You just have to you just have to assume then that the cost benefit of being able to have one motherboard design
[1427.16 --> 1432.52]  That can have dozens of different cpus in it is greater than the cost benefit or
[1433.16 --> 1438.04]  Performance benefit and therefore cost benefit so they can charge more for it the cost benefit of
[1438.60 --> 1443.64]  Soldering the cpu and then being locked with that inventory that is only sellable as a as a complete package
[1443.64 --> 1447.96]  Soldering the cpu and the ram would be so boring
[1449.32 --> 1455.56]  Yeah, I mean that's basically the the high performance uh, nooks that intel was doing that they ultimately gave up on
[1455.56 --> 1461.00]  I don't think enthusiasts want that yeah, and I don't know if enthusiasts will ever is a big word
[1461.48 --> 1464.28]  But I don't know that enthusiasts will ever want that
[1465.08 --> 1468.92]  It would really you're really not doing much building the computer
[1468.92 --> 1473.72]  At that point I do propose a solution in the video though
[1474.28 --> 1474.52]  uh
[1474.52 --> 1480.76]  Manch mal scott says you can get 5600 mega transfer ddr5 sodiums. I haven't seen them um
[1481.72 --> 1484.68]  And still not as fast that's still not as fast as the soldered ones
[1484.68 --> 1489.64]  So it's the point remains the same, but you are correct technically the very best kind etc
[1490.28 --> 1490.76]  um
[1490.76 --> 1495.64]  Anyway, I do propose a solution to all of this in the video, but i'm gonna make you watch it
[1495.64 --> 1499.16]  So anyway, yeah, because it's a good it's a good video. It's actually a good video
[1500.20 --> 1502.52]  What were we talking about right 4060 ti?
[1502.52 --> 1508.60]  Um, our discussion question is if nvidia is going to put so little effort into making this thing a success why release it at all?
[1509.16 --> 1511.80]  I don't know. It's a really good question. Um
[1514.04 --> 1515.00]  I guess uh
[1515.64 --> 1517.32]  A lot of these things are such a far run out
[1517.88 --> 1524.76]  Yeah, I guess they don't want to pull a film studios. Yeah, just be like yep, we're done making scooby-doo sequel, but let's we're actually come to you
[1524.76 --> 1528.92]  Do you know did you hear about that? Yeah, they just didn't release it right it is garbage can it?
[1528.92 --> 1533.56]  It's not just kind of done like it's not just shot like uh, uh batgirl
[1534.12 --> 1538.04]  Where it's completely shot, but not edited it is actually
[1538.76 --> 1540.12]  finished
[1540.12 --> 1544.44]  And the reason that it's finished so so people were actually working on this film
[1545.08 --> 1545.96]  for
[1545.96 --> 1547.88]  some period of time
[1547.88 --> 1554.04]  After the decision had been made they were working on this film they need to get it to a certain point for like a higher tax credit or something
[1554.04 --> 1556.44]  No, it was because their contract
[1557.32 --> 1559.32]  Was that they would finish it?
[1559.72 --> 1563.96]  So they wouldn't get paid like like outside outside animators or something like that
[1563.96 --> 1570.36]  I forget the exact details, but basically their contract stipulated that they were to deliver this finished work
[1571.24 --> 1572.60]  So the film was done
[1572.60 --> 1576.12]  It was in the final stages when they made the decision to pull the plug on it
[1576.44 --> 1580.36]  And then it will never see the light of day even though it is completely done
[1580.92 --> 1587.80]  Because it was more beneficial tax wise to write it off than to release it and have it make almost no money, which is
[1588.60 --> 1594.68]  Oh, apparently the movie got leaked. I was gonna say that's pretty these are the scenarios where you always just really want someone to leak it
[1594.92 --> 1595.64]  Yeah, that's uh
[1595.64 --> 1598.04]  I I I support that man. So that's good
[1598.28 --> 1605.88]  The film industry is in a very have you been following that only vaguely because I no longer have family members in the film industry, so I
[1605.88 --> 1607.88]  I
[1607.88 --> 1612.04]  I don't I mean it matters but like it's not it doesn't directly impact me as much anymore
[1612.04 --> 1613.24]  It is in a
[1614.04 --> 1616.60]  Wild place right now man like it's
[1616.60 --> 1618.44]  Rider strike is is
[1618.52 --> 1620.52]  I think one of the most
[1620.68 --> 1625.32]  Brutalizing in both directions strike that i've seen of any strike in a long time
[1625.32 --> 1631.56]  Well that and the actors jumped in with them. So so basically you cannot you cannot produce anything
[1631.56 --> 1635.64]  And I am deeply worried about the situation because
[1636.20 --> 1639.40]  I don't think that they have as much leverage as they think they do
[1640.04 --> 1645.16]  They're going on strike at a time when the studios are losing money on major releases
[1645.16 --> 1648.44]  I mean when's the last time that disney actually made money on anything?
[1649.16 --> 1654.52]  Um, like even major tentpole productions are not bringing in the kinds of profits that they used to
[1654.52 --> 1659.88]  And so you know, I was reading a few weeks ago about how cw basically like pulled out of vancouver
[1660.20 --> 1664.84]  So that was that was one of the networks that used to shoot a bunch up here in vancouver and was one of the
[1665.24 --> 1669.00]  One of the cornerstones of the local production industry and they were just like yeah
[1669.00 --> 1673.00]  We're like basically cancelling all of our scripted shows because they're too expensive forget it. See you later
[1673.56 --> 1677.16]  Um, so so the networks are looking for excuses to cut costs
[1677.16 --> 1681.08]  And then you have a whole bunch of people voluntarily going okay. You don't have to pay us right now
[1683.32 --> 1686.04]  And then the networks are kind of sitting there going like did you see that?
[1686.04 --> 1688.04]  Um, that alleged
[1688.04 --> 1691.72]  Houses or what alleged quote about basically starving them out
[1692.36 --> 1699.40]  Um, so something that came out today is that the screen actors guild released guidelines for influencers
[1699.96 --> 1702.12]  Yeah, um for you know how to
[1702.92 --> 1706.92]  Well, I really think they could have done this in a more constructive way
[1707.56 --> 1712.12]  Um, because you know frankly i'm not a member of the screen actors guild
[1712.60 --> 1714.76]  I will never be a member of the screen actors guild
[1714.84 --> 1721.96]  So like you actually cannot dictate the terms of engagement to me and they're it was it was done pretty poorly
[1722.04 --> 1724.92]  their wording's pretty aggro yeah, if you
[1726.12 --> 1729.40]  So much as post a picture of yourself putting on
[1730.28 --> 1732.68]  Pink shoes to go watch the barbie premiere
[1733.24 --> 1735.56]  Then you are in violation of the picket line
[1735.56 --> 1741.00]  And you're a terrible person will be banned from ever joining the screen actors. Yeah, yeah
[1741.00 --> 1744.20]  It's like bro. I am not good enough to try the screen actors
[1744.68 --> 1748.44]  Yeah, and I will never be an actor and also like are you kidding me?
[1748.44 --> 1750.84]  I you know this isn't even a paid engagement or whatever
[1751.48 --> 1752.84]  but
[1752.84 --> 1758.12]  Regardless of their tone and regardless of whether they actually are the boss of me or not, you know, I
[1758.12 --> 1760.12]  I
[1760.12 --> 1762.12]  I I fully
[1762.12 --> 1765.40]  I fully support them even if I feel like the battle is
[1767.64 --> 1768.76]  Concerning
[1768.76 --> 1771.08]  Pretty worrying you know when you're in like total war
[1771.80 --> 1774.12]  Right and there's that bar in the bottom
[1774.44 --> 1778.52]  That's like green and red for the strength of your remaining forces versus you know this
[1778.52 --> 1782.20]  I play video games. When's the last time you played total war?
[1783.24 --> 1785.24]  Don't worry about it. When was it?
[1785.24 --> 1787.48]  I don't know like a month ago. What?
[1788.12 --> 1789.24]  Yeah, I was just goofing around
[1789.88 --> 1792.84]  Whoa, yeah, we pulled out a total war game for like a video and I was like oh
[1792.84 --> 1794.04]  I love
[1794.04 --> 1798.04]  No, no, I was like I love playing total war and then like I went home and played some total war
[1798.04 --> 1801.88]  Oh man lost so bad because I hadn't touched it since Rome Rome won
[1801.88 --> 1802.36]  Yeah, yeah
[1802.36 --> 1802.84]  Total war
[1802.84 --> 1805.48]  That lines up for me. That makes sense. Yeah, anyway
[1807.64 --> 1810.52]  Anyway, so I have oh
[1811.48 --> 1816.20]  I don't make these decisions anymore. I have had a vision that I will have a
[1817.08 --> 1820.12]  conversation with our with our new ceo
[1821.08 --> 1826.52]  That I think we I think we should to the greatest degree the greatest extent that we can at least for
[1827.32 --> 1831.40]  You know some reasonable period of time, you know, let's say three months to start and we'll go from there
[1832.04 --> 1837.64]  You know, we want to be in full support and that means not only not taking money from any productions
[1837.88 --> 1841.24]  I mean that one's fairly obvious in terms of crossing the picket line
[1841.72 --> 1845.32]  But we also just won't be promoting them in any way
[1845.80 --> 1850.12]  Uh, even if I aren't putting on pink dresses unpaid capacity. I mean you're wearing a pink shirt
[1850.84 --> 1854.12]  I'm maybe wearing pink underwear. No yellow yellow today
[1854.12 --> 1855.64]  LTT store calm
[1856.60 --> 1861.48]  um, but yeah, we we want to we want to support them to the the greatest degree that that we can
[1861.88 --> 1867.56]  Uh, so we're gonna do our best to be clear. This is not because of barbie movie. This is because next weekend is
[1868.68 --> 1870.68]  So I was trying to hype it up
[1870.68 --> 1873.16]  Yeah, exactly. This is the whale and shirt last time
[1873.96 --> 1876.68]  whale so i'm wearing it because of ltx not because of barbie
[1876.68 --> 1882.76]  Just just you know, not not supporting you know blah blah blah blah blah
[1882.76 --> 1883.32]  Yeah
[1883.32 --> 1888.28]  Uh, have you guys done any promos or sponsorships with any studios in the past? Yeah, we have yeah
[1888.28 --> 1892.92]  Actually, not very often. It's kind of surprising surprisingly infrequent
[1892.92 --> 1899.64]  Yeah, like the number of video game movies and stuff like that that come out and it doesn't occur to them to go to gaming and tech
[1900.20 --> 1902.20]  influencers i'm just like
[1902.20 --> 1906.92]  We do people even try we tried doing a thing with hot am I a joke to you?
[1906.92 --> 1909.72]  And I thought hot wheels was gonna be all over it and
[1910.20 --> 1912.68]  I think they were just like ah, we don't see the crossover
[1912.76 --> 1919.48]  But then they did a thing with forza and yes, obviously forza's racing whenever but i'm like it's a game on pc
[1919.56 --> 1927.24]  That looks great people like building really nice pcs to play forza with like what how do you guys not see the crossover?
[1927.80 --> 1930.04]  There's people that like hot wheels that like computers come on
[1931.56 --> 1933.56]  Oh
[1934.20 --> 1936.60]  Anyways, um should we move on?
[1936.60 --> 1938.60]  Yeah, keep it chill in the chat guys
[1938.60 --> 1943.96]  Um, you know union versus no union is not a black and white issue
[1943.96 --> 1944.36]  No
[1944.36 --> 1948.44]  If you think it is you're wrong. Yeah, it's just not
[1949.88 --> 1954.20]  It's nuanced and complicated and every situation is a little bit different
[1954.84 --> 1956.84]  um
[1956.84 --> 1961.24]  And this situation is very challenging that's uh that's all I have to say about that
[1961.88 --> 1965.80]  It's time for a couple merch messages if you guys are wondering super chats
[1966.36 --> 1967.08]  Twitch bits
[1967.08 --> 1971.88]  Those are not the way to interact with the show the way to interact with the show is with merch messages
[1971.88 --> 1978.04]  All you got to do is head over to ltdstore.com where we actually have a couple pretty exciting things to talk about this week
[1978.04 --> 1981.88]  You head over to ltdstore.com and in the cart you will see a box with
[1982.52 --> 1986.36]  To fill in a merch message when we're live and it will pop up down here
[1986.60 --> 1990.44]  Thanks to producer dan or producer dan will reply to your message
[1991.08 --> 1996.60]  With his fingers like that. Oh my button's not working. I can't show producer dan anymore. Oh, oh, nope. It's working now cool
[1996.76 --> 2002.92]  Okay, or producer dan will reply or he will curate a couple for me and luke to talk about
[2002.92 --> 2007.16]  Uh dan do you have a couple for us to maybe show how merch messages work?
[2007.72 --> 2009.64]  Yeah, sure. Let's see what we've got here
[2010.12 --> 2014.84]  Question for luke. I recently started a job as a full stack developer for the government
[2015.08 --> 2020.60]  I'm wondering how do you feel about the differences between private versus public and switching between the two
[2020.60 --> 2027.64]  Oh, like private and public sector work. I believe something. Yeah, I believe so. Yeah, um, uh
[2029.96 --> 2034.60]  Have you ever worked? I don't think I have no, I don't think I have a very satisfactory answer here. Um
[2035.32 --> 2041.96]  I they're both very legitimate lines of work. I think there's a immense amount of red tape to jump through on the
[2042.68 --> 2047.40]  Uh public sector side of stuff that can be an immense amount of red tape on the private sector side of things, too
[2047.40 --> 2052.28]  Exactly. It depends what you're doing and it also depends on where you are at in the chain
[2052.28 --> 2056.76]  If you're working in public sector, but you are just you know dealing with the tickets
[2057.16 --> 2061.40]  Um, maybe there's no red tape for you to jump through you're just doing what you have to do
[2061.40 --> 2066.20]  So I don't know. I'm sorry. I really don't have a lot to say. I have no issue
[2066.20 --> 2069.72]  Like if someone applied here and they had public sector experience
[2070.04 --> 2074.92]  I'm just gonna count that as the the same as someone who had private sector experience
[2074.92 --> 2077.72]  Like it doesn't it doesn't mean anything different to me personally
[2077.96 --> 2083.16]  It might be particularly interesting depending on where you worked in the public sector and what you were working on
[2083.56 --> 2087.88]  But that's the same for private sector. So yeah, I don't know. Yeah, absolutely
[2087.88 --> 2092.44]  I mean, I think that there's some there's some general rules that you can kind of apply
[2092.92 --> 2094.12]  I mean
[2094.12 --> 2100.12]  At least here in canada is all I can really speak to but here in canada public sector workers tend to get
[2100.12 --> 2107.00]  Um, for example pensions that are very good stuff very very generous compared to what is typical in the private sector
[2107.00 --> 2109.40]  Where as far as corporations are concerned?
[2110.20 --> 2115.00]  I'm sorry. You're not working for me anymore. Why am I? Why am I giving you any money? Um, yeah
[2116.28 --> 2120.52]  Yeah, I also see people interpreting public sector work is like you're now on
[2121.24 --> 2123.24]  Like the track
[2123.24 --> 2127.96]  You just stay in public sector forever. No, as long as you don't massively screw up, you'll just like have a job
[2127.96 --> 2134.20]  No, I I don't think it I don't think it's necessarily like that and I don't think you necessarily have to have that attitude about it
[2134.76 --> 2139.00]  Um, I mean, I think you might have interpreted that in a way that I was not trying to say it or maybe I said it poorly
[2139.48 --> 2142.76]  I don't know, but I wasn't saying it as a negative thing. Oh, oh, I see what you mean. Yeah
[2143.00 --> 2144.04]  Yeah, I mean I oh
[2144.04 --> 2147.72]  I thought you were kind of saying that people just feel like they can check out and just like
[2147.88 --> 2150.76]  Oh, no, not necessarily just like if you if you just keep pushing
[2151.64 --> 2156.92]  It's it's like very high job security basically, but not that you should necessarily slack off
[2156.92 --> 2162.12]  I know people that have been I know of people that have been laid off from public sector. It does happen. Yeah, for sure
[2162.44 --> 2163.80]  but like
[2163.80 --> 2164.60]  Yeah
[2164.60 --> 2170.68]  Good pension good benefits like it's a it's a good place to be in but you could get in a better place in private sector
[2171.16 --> 2173.16]  There's gonna be a ceiling. Yeah
[2173.16 --> 2180.68]  There's there's gonna be a ceiling in the public sector. So the yeah, there's no free lunch, right? There's always trade-offs and
[2182.12 --> 2186.44]  Like we uh, we we were actually trying to recruit someone for uh, only
[2186.92 --> 2194.36]  Tangentially related position from the public sector and when they did the math it was you know, it was very it was very challenging for them
[2194.60 --> 2198.12]  They were kind of going okay, so right the wage is higher, but
[2199.56 --> 2204.44]  The odds of the government of british columbia existing
[2205.00 --> 2208.36]  In you know 40 years when i'm reaching the end of my career is
[2209.40 --> 2215.64]  Somewhere close to 100 percent the odds of linus sebastian and yvonne hoe existing
[2215.64 --> 2218.12]  In that time is you know pretty good
[2218.44 --> 2223.40]  But not as close to 100 percent and this is something that they need to factor in along with
[2223.80 --> 2229.56]  The you know the differences in pay today versus the you know the long-term benefit. I think that something people
[2230.20 --> 2232.44]  Don't necessarily account for is that
[2233.32 --> 2238.28]  Pensions look a little bit more generous than they actually are in many cases
[2238.28 --> 2242.68]  Uh, this was something that I figured out with uh with life insurance a long time ago
[2242.68 --> 2248.44]  There was some there was some fancy life insurance product that someone was trying to sell us where basically when it matures
[2248.92 --> 2253.08]  You actually get back everything you paid into it and I was like, how does the math on that work?
[2253.48 --> 2257.40]  It's like, oh, right because they've been taking because they've been taking my money for
[2257.64 --> 2261.32]  35 or 45 years or whatever and they're just giving me back
[2261.32 --> 2269.08]  You give you give you give me five bucks now. I'll give you five bucks in 30 years. Yeah, exactly exactly
[2269.48 --> 2270.76]  Uh, so that's that's the math
[2270.76 --> 2273.40]  So when you when you look at you know, whatever your pension is
[2273.80 --> 2276.68]  Uh, the math might look really really favorable today
[2277.24 --> 2281.88]  But if you were to just take money and squirrel it away now and build yourself
[2282.84 --> 2288.68]  A nest egg that is you know made up of an investment say for example that pay dividends
[2288.68 --> 2291.32]  Uh, then I don't know
[2292.20 --> 2296.92]  How does that pension compare and pensions aren't as sure a thing as it feels like they used to be
[2297.48 --> 2299.80]  You look at the way that so they're they're not yeah
[2299.80 --> 2305.88]  You look at the way that uh public pension funds are just getting the crap kicked out of them sometimes and it's it's scary, man
[2306.44 --> 2311.72]  I read a whole article on how they've you read a whole article. Yeah, did you article?
[2311.96 --> 2315.56]  I'm a good boy. Gold star. I read a it's it's on the like the
[2315.56 --> 2317.56]  of
[2318.12 --> 2322.28]  Pensions specifically right and how they've just kind of like ruined them over time
[2322.36 --> 2327.08]  They used to be a lot more secure. They used to be a lot more guaranteed and now they've been just like trashed
[2327.80 --> 2328.92]  um
[2328.92 --> 2334.60]  To the point where retiring is like kind of scary because you just have no idea what's going to happen with your pension
[2334.76 --> 2339.40]  Yeah, especially because like with how long people are living these days you could be retired for
[2340.20 --> 2343.80]  35 years assuming you retire at 65 and live to
[2344.76 --> 2346.76]  100 which is
[2347.00 --> 2348.12]  Obviously
[2348.12 --> 2353.40]  Unusual not common but happens but not unheard of yeah, and you do not want to be
[2354.04 --> 2358.28]  98 and totally broke and completely flat broke right
[2359.32 --> 2360.92]  That's a bad time
[2362.20 --> 2363.56]  Yep
[2363.56 --> 2367.40]  All right, dan want to hit us with another yeah sure thing let's see um
[2367.40 --> 2374.84]  Um, hi lld. Can you talk about the first time or the worst time you have accidentally violated an nda?
[2377.00 --> 2380.84]  Oh, I think one of the worst ones was with the pixel
[2381.40 --> 2386.36]  I think it was the pixel 4a or something like that pixel 4a or pixel 5a
[2386.76 --> 2390.92]  I went up a day early 3a or something. I don't know. I know I was using it early
[2390.92 --> 2393.72]  And I was on when show and I pulled out my phone
[2393.72 --> 2395.80]  I was gonna say it's probably on land show. Yeah, I know
[2399.40 --> 2401.96]  It's okay companies I understand he does it to me too
[2403.16 --> 2404.52]  Yeah, I um
[2405.88 --> 2411.72]  I mean at least it's been an accident every time but there's been yeah, there's been at least a handful of times that I have
[2412.36 --> 2415.56]  Accidentally violated an nda. I think there's a video that was
[2415.56 --> 2421.16]  Accidentally scheduled one day early or like one hour earlier one minute earlier or something. Yeah, I mean what it was
[2421.24 --> 2426.12]  It's one of those things where a common time for nda's to expire is 6 a.m
[2426.20 --> 2431.08]  Pacific time and the reason for that is that it's still the previous evening
[2431.40 --> 2437.24]  Is it previous or whatever whichever way the date line goes I can never remember but it's still the no the following
[2437.24 --> 2439.24]  It's still the following evening
[2439.24 --> 2446.52]  In like Southeast Asia and China and then it's still daytime in Europe. So it's like
[2448.76 --> 2453.00]  Yeah, yeah, it's like morning in Europe. No, no, it's afternoon in Europe
[2453.48 --> 2455.48]  morning to like
[2455.48 --> 2460.92]  Late morning in North America and like still evening in Australia and like China and stuff
[2461.16 --> 2467.96]  And so it's like an ideal time from a global, you know, sending out emails and publishing videos standpoint
[2467.96 --> 2472.52]  But most people in this company don't get up at six in the morning
[2472.92 --> 2477.24]  so we will sometimes have videos that are just scheduled to go live and
[2478.36 --> 2480.36]  Nobody's there looking at them and if they
[2481.72 --> 2488.20]  You know include some information that they weren't supposed to or if they go up at five instead of six because we click the wrong button
[2488.20 --> 2493.56]  Or whatever and people try to contact us like we're asleep, right? So sorry, I guess
[2493.56 --> 2495.56]  Yeah
[2495.56 --> 2498.52]  Not really much that we can we can do about that
[2499.08 --> 2503.96]  I'm just trying to find if there's anyone that has searching my inbox for nda brings up
[2505.48 --> 2507.80]  Here's result one to a hundred of many
[2508.28 --> 2510.20]  Yeah, so I was trying to find if
[2511.16 --> 2516.92]  If anyone you know would complain to me about anything, but I I don't see anything generally speaking
[2516.92 --> 2524.76]  We try to be pretty clean about that stuff because it's a really quick way to not be able to get review samples anymore breaking embargo or
[2525.72 --> 2528.20]  violating a non-disclosure agreement and
[2529.00 --> 2529.56]  To be clear
[2529.56 --> 2535.80]  I know there's some people that are sort of just like anti any kind of agreement between media and manufacturers, but it's like
[2535.80 --> 2539.96]  Let's just be some okay. What what's your what's your get review samples at all?
[2539.96 --> 2543.32]  Yeah, isn't any nda's in place. What's your proposed solution?
[2543.32 --> 2545.32]  They have
[2545.32 --> 2550.28]  Magical fairies that they give the phone or the graphics card to that
[2551.24 --> 2558.92]  All depart their headquarters at different times to ensure that you know the you account for the different flight times to all the different places
[2558.92 --> 2563.32]  That these devices need to be delivered so that they'll all get it at exactly the same moment
[2563.56 --> 2566.04]  You know, you want mark rober to design packaging that
[2566.36 --> 2571.16]  Literally is indestructible until it can be opened at exactly the same time like you got to be realistic, right?
[2571.16 --> 2575.80]  Uh, they they do their best to get everything out at kind of the same time ish
[2576.04 --> 2583.08]  And then they have nda's to ensure that everyone has a similar amount of time to work on their articles or their videos or whatever the case may be
[2586.44 --> 2590.28]  Yeah, I can't find any that's okay i'm over it
[2593.56 --> 2594.52]  What were we talking about again?
[2594.52 --> 2597.96]  Oh, yeah, sure. Let's do a couple more topics
[2599.00 --> 2604.84]  Okay, do you want to talk about your proposed legislation that requires platforms to snitch on their users?
[2604.84 --> 2605.56]  This one is
[2606.44 --> 2610.68]  Really rough once you start trying to break down like how it would work at all
[2610.68 --> 2615.08]  Uh, the senate judiciary committee has forwarded a piece of legislation
[2615.88 --> 2624.68]  The cooper davis act that would obligate online community communication services and social platforms to report users to the dea
[2625.56 --> 2631.48]  At the drug enforcement agency if the platform suspect them of being involved in criminal drug activity
[2631.48 --> 2636.68]  Okay, the problem with this is that like the definition of criminal drug activity
[2636.68 --> 2637.08]  Oh, yeah
[2637.08 --> 2637.32]  Is
[2638.12 --> 2640.84]  I think we could say outdated at best. Oh, yeah
[2642.44 --> 2644.92]  Yep, the bill does not explicitly require
[2644.92 --> 2647.08]  Imbalanced imbalanced maybe
[2648.20 --> 2652.20]  It's just it's also especially in the states. Well, yeah, that's what we're talking about
[2652.76 --> 2657.88]  And stuff. Oh, it's all over the place. It's so weird and like in some places it'll be fed
[2657.88 --> 2663.64]  And I don't understand how this works. I'm not um, uh, I don't I'm not in that area. I don't do those things
[2664.12 --> 2668.28]  Um, but in some places it'll be federally illegal
[2668.76 --> 2675.08]  Yeah, but I I don't know. I think it's usually the other way around where it's legal federally but illegal stateside
[2675.48 --> 2679.16]  I think it might be able to be the reverse as well, but I don't know how that works. I I don't know
[2679.72 --> 2686.84]  Um, the bill does not require this is in quotes. The bill does not require providers to seek out illegal activity by users
[2687.48 --> 2688.36]  End quote
[2688.36 --> 2692.76]  But if but it creates incentives for companies to incentives is
[2693.96 --> 2699.40]  For companies to surveil their users and does require that once providers are aware of this activity
[2699.56 --> 2706.68]  They must report it or else face steep fines legal liability and potential criminal prosecution
[2708.68 --> 2716.52]  Again in quotes proponents of the bill say that it would help crack down on illicit drug markets that have been proliferating on social media platforms end quote
[2716.84 --> 2723.80]  But privacy advocates have criticized the bill as potentially furthering weakening and in quotes already
[2724.04 --> 2731.80]  Inadequate privacy laws strongly agree with that and undermining encryption. Yeah, this is kind of brutal like i'm i'm looking at it going
[2733.32 --> 2735.96]  You know if someone um, okay, I I
[2737.16 --> 2739.48]  Look I I don't personally partake
[2739.48 --> 2741.96]  So my ignorance may be
[2742.52 --> 2743.16]  Pretty ignorant
[2743.72 --> 2748.44]  But you know, I could see someone using facebook marketplace for example hypothetically to
[2749.24 --> 2749.64]  uh
[2749.64 --> 2750.84]  to do some kind of
[2751.48 --> 2752.36]  transaction
[2752.36 --> 2752.92]  Let's say
[2753.32 --> 2756.60]  Uh, you know, you know how okay for example, you can't buy lawn darts on ebay
[2757.08 --> 2759.88]  Okay, so everyone who wants to sell lawn darts on ebay
[2760.52 --> 2762.20]  sells the box for lawn darts
[2762.20 --> 2767.56]  I know by the way if lawn darts happen to be inside it. Well, whoops. I had no idea
[2768.52 --> 2774.84]  So like I I could see people you know selling pictures of a marijuana leaf on facebook marketplace and like that's code for
[2774.84 --> 2776.92]  Yeah, I don't know. Maybe this is a thing. Maybe it's not a thing
[2776.92 --> 2778.92]  I legitimately actually don't know
[2778.92 --> 2785.08]  But then you know, where's the line for this if meta I am selling an unknown brick
[2785.88 --> 2791.80]  Yeah, if meta if meta knows that people are doing this all of a sudden or if they suspect it even
[2792.28 --> 2799.72]  All of a sudden are they are they required to and especially a platform like meta where they're trying to gather any possible information about their users
[2799.80 --> 2802.60]  They they might have to like change what they're doing in order to not
[2803.32 --> 2805.32]  um expect these types of things
[2807.08 --> 2814.44]  The harshness of the penalty for failing to report is likely to encourage companies to over report users for protected free speech
[2814.52 --> 2821.24]  Which may result in a chilling effect that prevents users from discussing past addiction joking or reaching out for help
[2822.20 --> 2828.20]  The Senate has yet to put the act to a full floor vote again. It's not like it's this is not it's not through
[2828.92 --> 2832.52]  Some people are super mad that i'm not a pothead and then others are like yeah
[2832.52 --> 2834.84]  I knew it mad that you're not a pothead. Yeah, I don't know
[2834.84 --> 2837.64]  Well, I'm mad people people just like you know
[2838.20 --> 2841.00]  Having things in common my creator must do what I do
[2841.00 --> 2845.40]  Or else i'm angry on internet i'm high on life. Okay
[2848.12 --> 2850.12]  Got these ketchup chips dare
[2853.00 --> 2855.00]  Oh, man
[2855.00 --> 2857.88]  That's great. Uh, but yeah, I don't know. I hate this thoroughly
[2858.92 --> 2862.44]  As as someone who runs platforms this sounds like the worst
[2862.44 --> 2872.60]  Yeah, it sounds basically I mean even if we ignore the overreach even if we ignore the complete lack of sensibility in
[2873.40 --> 2878.52]  Narcotics laws in I mean really the world uh the inconsistency as well
[2878.52 --> 2880.52]  Even if we ignore all those issues
[2881.08 --> 2883.96]  How on earth could they possibly hope?
[2885.08 --> 2886.28]  to
[2886.28 --> 2888.28]  enforce this
[2888.60 --> 2890.60]  How can you prove?
[2890.60 --> 2894.12]  That they they knew that this user was
[2896.36 --> 2901.88]  How can they prove that the platform suspected a user of being involved in criminal drug activity?
[2901.88 --> 2903.88]  I wouldn't be surprised looking at the like
[2904.76 --> 2909.16]  The wording at least for the penalties involved. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some amount of like
[2909.72 --> 2912.92]  Bounties for reporting your company for not reporting things
[2912.92 --> 2919.64]  So you could like make a bunch of money for throwing the company that employs you under the bus
[2920.20 --> 2921.08]  Just go somewhere else
[2921.88 --> 2922.44]  um
[2922.44 --> 2924.52]  Because I I I feel like they've
[2925.80 --> 2926.76]  The the only
[2927.48 --> 2931.16]  The only sites and services that would really be doing any amount of
[2932.12 --> 2934.36]  assessment of users at this level
[2935.56 --> 2940.20]  Would be really big sites and services that have lots of money and have lots of employees
[2940.20 --> 2942.76]  And are probably at a point where they're like
[2944.60 --> 2949.80]  The the people coming to work here they don't necessarily care too much about the company at that scale
[2949.80 --> 2951.72]  So maybe they'll take the payday
[2952.52 --> 2954.76]  I don't know it just it just seems kind of
[2955.24 --> 2956.92]  Whack to me personally
[2957.56 --> 2962.52]  Yeah, bixby in floatplane chat says suspicious activity reports are a thing for banking institutions
[2962.52 --> 2964.76]  For example to report suspected money laundering
[2964.76 --> 2966.36]  I feel like that's different
[2966.84 --> 2970.60]  Well, well, no like in terms of how they could how they could
[2971.24 --> 2975.24]  Um incentivize the employees like what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I could see that
[2975.88 --> 2976.68]  and I mean
[2977.72 --> 2981.00]  Drugs are one of those things where you will definitely get people
[2981.80 --> 2986.28]  With very polarized opinions about it, you know, you'll have people with the giant
[2986.92 --> 2990.84]  Marijuana leaf on their t-shirt literally walking down the street holding a bong
[2990.84 --> 2996.20]  And then on the other side of it, you've got the you know think of the children prudes who are like I
[2996.84 --> 3003.24]  There should be no drugs in the world. They should take all the naturally occurring plants that have you know
[3004.44 --> 3005.08]  Um
[3005.08 --> 3009.40]  Tyno tylenol bad is not the one that's bark or something. I don't remember
[3009.96 --> 3015.16]  Not to that degree but like you know anything with a psychoactive effect should basically be put in a big fire
[3015.16 --> 3019.48]  Oh, but not close to people in australia and we should get rid of all of it, right?
[3019.48 --> 3021.32]  Like so you've got you've got both sides of this
[3021.32 --> 3025.64]  So I think you're gonna have people that are just essentially ready to go to war over this
[3026.28 --> 3028.36]  immediately after something like this sort of pass. I mean, I
[3030.20 --> 3033.80]  Man, I was about to say I really don't see how this could possibly pass
[3033.88 --> 3035.88]  But like I don't know wilder things have happened
[3035.88 --> 3040.60]  You look at look at the look at the gong show that was like natural gas stoves
[3041.24 --> 3045.48]  Or like ranges a little while ago like just how just how quickly people can
[3046.44 --> 3049.56]  Form ranks and just go after each other
[3049.96 --> 3056.68]  Also, you know given the number of recreational drugs these days that are pharmaceutical products
[3058.20 --> 3062.12]  How on earth do you prove that I didn't need that adderall?
[3062.12 --> 3069.64]  I mean, I didn't get it from a pharmacy in this case, so that's that's one thing well, that's I mean
[3069.64 --> 3070.68]  Maybe they were closed
[3071.96 --> 3077.08]  That's if they're using it as a marketplace, but lots of these places they're also including just talking about it
[3078.36 --> 3083.64]  Right and I I don't know but I I just looking at the things that I hear like you
[3083.64 --> 3089.24]  You hear about a lot of fatalities from fentanyl for example. That's a big one in vancouver. We hear news about that all the time
[3089.24 --> 3096.12]  Um, but fentanyl is a is a drug they give in hospitals. Yep. So like
[3098.84 --> 3105.40]  What if someone is prescribed fentanyl well, you wouldn't be prescribed it is it only ever administered at hospitals?
[3105.40 --> 3108.84]  Because the the amount of it to be that's lethal is like so tiny
[3109.56 --> 3115.32]  It's very trace tiny. Yeah, what if you talked about how it had been how you've had it before?
[3115.32 --> 3118.04]  Yeah, but you were just meant in a hospital
[3118.68 --> 3124.92]  And it's like even if that person doesn't ultimately end up in jail look at the amount of administrative nonsense that you're creating
[3126.68 --> 3131.48]  What a what a waste of time when police departments quite frankly have enough on their hands
[3132.04 --> 3136.84]  Um, someone in Philippine chat says you can be prescribed fentanyl for at-home use my dad had it
[3136.84 --> 3137.88]  No way
[3137.88 --> 3140.12]  That sounds terrifying
[3142.12 --> 3149.16]  Lost insanity says hey, so the state of louisiana finally sent out an email today that those who were affected by the department of motor vehicles hack that occurred
[3149.56 --> 3153.00]  They're providing a year of life lock to anyone that was affected by it
[3153.00 --> 3158.52]  But they finally notified people of it at least this is something that i've found quite confusing for a long time
[3158.52 --> 3163.72]  So, you know how difficult it is to change a social insurance number or for our american friends a social security number?
[3163.72 --> 3166.28]  Um, you know once you have it assigned to you
[3167.24 --> 3175.64]  You know how impossible it is to change your birth date for example like these these key pieces of information that can aid people in committing identity theft or fraud
[3175.64 --> 3176.60]  Oh, um
[3176.60 --> 3182.20]  The fact that the only mitigation that is offered are these um
[3182.92 --> 3184.44]  These monitoring services
[3185.24 --> 3190.20]  Like uh, I get life lock is one that I haven't heard of before but i've heard of it before
[3190.20 --> 3194.68]  I find it weird that they grant you a temporary amount of time with a private service
[3194.68 --> 3196.60]  Yeah, well, that's really weird to me
[3196.60 --> 3198.76]  That's exactly kind of where I was going with that
[3198.76 --> 3203.48]  So whether it's like trends union or life lock or or any one of those kinds of organizations
[3205.16 --> 3206.60]  Why
[3206.60 --> 3208.04]  Why is this a thing?
[3208.04 --> 3210.44]  Yeah, this feels like one of those things where you look at and you go
[3211.40 --> 3213.16]  That's got to be lobbying. Oh, yeah
[3213.32 --> 3216.92]  Because the obvious answer is a permanent solution. Yes
[3216.92 --> 3224.76]  Yes, and the not obvious answer is one that you pay a subscription to some rando third-party company
[3225.08 --> 3230.28]  That has had their own breaches in the past. I don't know if life lock has but transunion certainly has
[3230.92 --> 3232.52]  forever
[3232.52 --> 3234.52]  And i'm sorry you're giving me one year
[3235.08 --> 3238.20]  So what if i'm a criminal mastermind? I basically just go
[3238.92 --> 3246.20]  Do do do do do i'ma wait 365 days a do do do to do this information will all still be valid
[3247.00 --> 3249.00]  Come on. Are you serious right now?
[3249.88 --> 3255.64]  January 15th, 2023 thousands of norton life lock customers had their accounts compromised in recent weeks
[3255.64 --> 3258.84]  Potentially allowing criminal hackers to access customer password managers
[3259.64 --> 3262.28]  The company revealed in a recent data breach notice
[3264.60 --> 3264.84]  Cool
[3266.68 --> 3269.16]  No, that's a nice hat. I disagree
[3269.72 --> 3275.96]  This is from float plane chat. They do know better. I think they do know better. I think it's just
[3276.52 --> 3278.52]  The oldest reason in the world
[3278.92 --> 3279.88]  It's money money money
[3280.44 --> 3284.84]  Man, if you want to go down a good rabbit hole the uh the fact that um
[3285.40 --> 3289.88]  Turbo tax exists at all. Oh god. No, okay. You've already done this one. Oh, yeah
[3289.88 --> 3295.96]  That's such a that enrages me that should so not even close to be okay
[3296.12 --> 3301.80]  That's so frustrating like I I I understand government services and some private services
[3301.80 --> 3306.60]  Even you shouldn't just be able to like crush companies from existing all the time and stuff like that
[3306.60 --> 3313.56]  But that same setup should not be allowed to exist to forcibly keep
[3314.52 --> 3320.68]  Completely useless motions in in like completely useless things in motion. It's so
[3321.24 --> 3324.20]  Incredibly frustrating people are mad about the US tax system. Yeah
[3324.20 --> 3326.52]  Yeah
[3326.52 --> 3327.00]  It's not as bad in canada
[3327.48 --> 3331.96]  But it's still completely messed up. It's still bad. It's still ridiculous
[3331.96 --> 3334.68]  American tax is just a complete utter joke
[3335.24 --> 3336.68]  Like potentially
[3336.68 --> 3342.52]  Worst and there's so much stuff that's so dumb one of the things that I was just outraged to find out as an adult
[3342.52 --> 3345.40]  Is that when you buy a secondhand vehicle?
[3346.20 --> 3348.44]  You have to pay sales tax on it
[3349.00 --> 3353.72]  And i'm sitting here going no you already taxed this yeah, that's double dipping
[3354.60 --> 3357.24]  Like am I if I okay if I if I if I
[3357.80 --> 3360.36]  The double dipping rabbit hole. There's a lot
[3361.64 --> 3363.64]  There's an absurd amount of that
[3365.00 --> 3370.36]  Like if I deduct something this year do I get to deduct it again next year because I gifted it to my wife
[3370.36 --> 3372.36]  Like what are you talking about?
[3372.76 --> 3375.00]  You guys just traded back and forth
[3377.40 --> 3381.40]  Oh, i'm sure people do that it's it's such a joke man
[3384.04 --> 3389.00]  I don't know it's very very very frustrating the whole like we know exactly how much you owe
[3389.00 --> 3392.60]  But you need to tell us and if you're wrong you're screwed. Yeah, what?
[3393.24 --> 3397.16]  Why? Yeah, do you know how it works for corporate tax here?
[3397.16 --> 3402.52]  Not as much okay, so uh, you know how with personal taxes you um
[3403.08 --> 3407.24]  You have them deducted by your employer on your paycheck automatically, right?
[3407.80 --> 3412.60]  Um, or or you cannot right like you can you can go that option if you want
[3412.60 --> 3414.92]  I don't think that's something that we offer just because
[3415.80 --> 3422.20]  Offering both sounds like a paperwork nightmare. Um, no offense to everyone, but people do not manage their finances very well
[3422.20 --> 3424.20]  So if people got their whole paycheck
[3425.72 --> 3433.08]  Every time then in when april rolled around they would not have honestly that is very wise and I support this like
[3433.08 --> 3438.36]  25 to you know 30 plus percentage of their annual income that they would owe in taxes at that time
[3438.60 --> 3444.84]  So anyway, the way personal taxes work they're due in april in tax season and you pay them at that time
[3444.84 --> 3450.20]  And the way corporate taxes work is based on your last year
[3451.56 --> 3454.36]  You will pay installments every month
[3455.64 --> 3460.92]  Based on the last year and if it turns out you were wrong and you actually owe more
[3461.56 --> 3464.68]  Then you owe interest for not like estimating it correctly
[3465.08 --> 3470.92]  So instead of it just like having a due date at the end of the year you need to be paying it continuously or you basically get boned
[3470.92 --> 3473.00]  It's absolutely ridiculous. Oh my god
[3473.00 --> 3480.28]  Yeah, I hate it. I hate it so much. I'm pretty sure they don't pay you interest if you overpay on it either
[3480.28 --> 3481.96]  But don't quote me on that
[3481.96 --> 3486.20]  Don't quote me on that surprised. Yeah, I'd be I'd be very surprised. I had no idea
[3486.20 --> 3491.08]  But someone said we don't do taxes in the UK. It's done by the government that that is how that should work
[3492.52 --> 3496.60]  Whiskeytang says doing it anyways employees should be able to decide what happens with their money
[3497.08 --> 3499.80]  No, no, you're actually just wrong. Yeah, um
[3500.44 --> 3508.28]  Because they don't get to anyway. They owe it in taxes. Yeah, um, it's just that we don't want people to suddenly go bankrupt
[3508.60 --> 3514.92]  Yeah, that's really bad actually extremely chaotic. Yeah, not not having those taxes on hand
[3515.00 --> 3517.96]  not having those tax payments on hand in april would be
[3518.68 --> 3523.00]  potentially devastating to the lives of someone who didn't manage their money correctly
[3523.00 --> 3529.24]  And most which is very common. Yeah, most people are not able to just look at like
[3529.88 --> 3534.20]  $10,000 in their bank account and go okay. No, I I should I should actually hold on to that
[3534.76 --> 3536.04]  um
[3536.20 --> 3538.44]  and like like luke said the
[3539.32 --> 3539.80]  um
[3539.80 --> 3543.56]  The additional paperwork of handling it both ways would be extremely complicated
[3544.12 --> 3547.64]  That alone is like that makes it kind of not worth it in my opinion. Yeah
[3547.64 --> 3553.40]  Um, where are we at? What are we doing?
[3553.96 --> 3558.68]  We're talking about proposed legislation for platform snitching. Yeah, is that it? We got to do one more?
[3558.68 --> 3561.56]  Yeah, let's let's talk about something else. Do you want to do build of the month?
[3562.12 --> 3569.08]  Yeah, why not? This is kind of fun. Yeah. Yeah, so we we requested submissions for custom water cooling loops
[3569.08 --> 3573.80]  And we got some pretty amazing ones. Dan, do you have these or do I show them or like how does this work?
[3574.36 --> 3575.88]  I have no idea. I guess you show them
[3576.44 --> 3580.52]  I was hoping we would have them in a in a different way of showing them
[3580.84 --> 3585.88]  This is you're the doc for you not me. I mean, I guess how do ad spots work, Dan?
[3585.88 --> 3589.48]  I am uh made aware of them before the show. Yeah
[3590.36 --> 3594.44]  So we thought this might be as well. Oh, cool. Well, no at any rate
[3596.20 --> 3598.84]  This is pretty sick. Luke do you want to talk through them and i'll show them?
[3599.56 --> 3602.84]  Sure. Yeah. Oh, that's unfortunate
[3603.80 --> 3607.00]  Dan, I fix I fix yeah, you can just get rid of us for now
[3608.60 --> 3613.48]  This looks like that's harder flipping amazing simple but elegant also are those
[3613.48 --> 3615.56]  LTT edition fans?
[3617.00 --> 3620.84]  Ooh, it's hard to tell with the red lighting. I can't tell you know what? No, I think they're chromaxes
[3621.00 --> 3626.44]  I think they're chromaxes. I think they came later, but that would have been pretty sick. This is from at redneck engineer
[3626.44 --> 3634.36]  It's a 7950x 7900 xtx and all ek water block cooling components
[3634.52 --> 3642.04]  Because that's how you redneck engineer. No, no, I showed you guys how to redneck engineer a water cooling system earlier this week
[3642.04 --> 3645.72]  That is how you actually redneck engineer water cooling
[3646.68 --> 3651.48]  This uh, is the first ever custom loop with 3d printed chassis
[3651.48 --> 3657.48]  Yeah, I was gonna say that case looks 3d printed, but it actually looks really cool. 3d printed chassis looks sick
[3657.80 --> 3659.00]  Uh by dan
[3659.00 --> 3664.84]  Oh, I feel like i've read this name out before but I can't don't remember how to pronounce it
[3665.24 --> 3668.92]  Sun sund fist that's very wrong sund fist
[3668.92 --> 3675.48]  That sounds more right. I'm certain i've tried to say that before um or at de toffel
[3676.04 --> 3680.68]  Uh mostly used alpha cool parts. Those are really cool fans
[3681.64 --> 3685.72]  Agreed. Oh, yeah, I really like are those the are those those li and li ones
[3688.44 --> 3691.88]  Uh, you don't know and it's okay. No. All right
[3691.88 --> 3697.40]  I am actually really digging this open concept from yan k
[3698.44 --> 3702.44]  Yeah, I like I like that. It's not just a flat board
[3702.92 --> 3709.56]  It's a flat board, but with angles with angles. It's an angled board. It's a parallelogram. It's not just turned though
[3710.44 --> 3712.92]  It isn't because the the sides are oh, yeah
[3712.92 --> 3717.56]  No, no that yeah, it's a parallelogram. Yeah, both sides parallel. Yeah, very cool
[3717.56 --> 3724.92]  Looks yeah, kind of sick kind of love it. I I enjoy board mounted pcs, but they often look junky and cheap
[3725.16 --> 3730.44]  This one does not look junky cheap. It looks great. The backlighting helps a lot. That looks cheap, but it doesn't look junky
[3731.00 --> 3732.52]  Yeah, yeah
[3732.52 --> 3734.52]  Yeah, these holes
[3734.52 --> 3741.64]  Two dual rads and stuff like the the board itself doesn't exactly look necessarily expensive. It looks like a project board from home depot, but yeah
[3741.64 --> 3745.96]  Um, but it's done nice. Yeah, yeah, but the the system build is really nice
[3745.96 --> 3750.68]  I can also tell that um some adjustments were made to get the uh the fan
[3751.72 --> 3753.72]  Connectors through the holes
[3754.12 --> 3756.28]  I've been there. I've been there jan
[3757.88 --> 3760.04]  I feel you I appreciate the shown work
[3761.48 --> 3763.48]  Uh, we've got two more
[3764.12 --> 3766.20]  One wow three more
[3766.20 --> 3775.24]  That is unreal old school from back in the thread ripper days by uh at xx boosty xx
[3776.12 --> 3780.04]  And this is an honorable mention from diy perks
[3780.68 --> 3789.08]  This appears to be something from an upcoming video. I am a diy diy perks fanboy and uh
[3789.24 --> 3796.04]  Me too. This this is this is part of why I tried to get him to come to ltx, but it's just too far. It's quite far. Yeah, uh someday
[3796.20 --> 3801.56]  Someday I'd love to get you out here man, but we weren't able to make it work this time. Of course
[3802.52 --> 3807.56]  The main reason that we built all of this up for you guys and got you all you know, whoa
[3808.04 --> 3810.04]  Look at these great builds
[3810.68 --> 3812.68]  It's because of the best one
[3813.16 --> 3814.76]  The best one
[3815.00 --> 3821.00]  Dishonorable mention this avant-garde use of garden pond pump by at uh spear 83
[3821.00 --> 3823.00]  Uh
[3823.56 --> 3824.68]  Is is just
[3825.48 --> 3830.04]  Just beautiful apparently they did a reverse image search to confirm that it's not a common
[3830.60 --> 3833.24]  A common meme image and it is fresh
[3834.36 --> 3835.40]  This this is it
[3837.24 --> 3838.84]  It's like looking at your grandfather
[3840.76 --> 3842.76]  It's like bathing your grandfather
[3842.76 --> 3848.20]  All right, absolutely love it. Um
[3849.56 --> 3855.64]  All right, do you want to do do you want to do globo comes to world of warcraft or should we save that for after whatever the next thing?
[3856.12 --> 3856.36]  Mr
[3856.36 --> 3858.12]  bester wants us to
[3858.28 --> 3859.16]  I
[3859.16 --> 3865.32]  I love I think we can do this in 10 minutes. I love glorbo. No, I want to do sponsors first. Okay, let's get let's get the sponsors
[3865.32 --> 3869.72]  Done the show is brought to you today by someone very unusual
[3870.68 --> 3872.28]  Uh, what order do you want to do these in dan?
[3875.56 --> 3877.56]  He can reach it
[3877.56 --> 3879.56]  He can do it
[3882.92 --> 3889.64]  He got it. Oh gosh. Oh boy. That's right. It's brought to you by google and youtube shopping
[3890.44 --> 3895.96]  I know a thing or two about foldables being one of those people who actually daily drives one
[3896.44 --> 3901.08]  I had the I had the most surreal experience at a wendy's last week
[3901.80 --> 3904.28]  Okay, so i'm there with um
[3905.56 --> 3911.00]  A couple members of our team as well as there's like some other random random customers
[3911.56 --> 3917.88]  And I am struggling to remember a name right now. Good. I guess elijah elijah from our team relatively new member
[3917.88 --> 3921.88]  I swear i'm trying to remember everyone's names. That's hard elijah and I are both like
[3922.76 --> 3927.96]  On our phones after having ordered and we're just like waiting and i'm like hey another fold user
[3928.84 --> 3931.72]  Um, and he's like oh, yeah, that's right
[3931.72 --> 3935.24]  Yeah, you you you daily drive one of those too and then this random customer walks up
[3935.24 --> 3937.40]  He's like I have a folding phone too
[3937.48 --> 3940.68]  And we're like this is the most folding phone users that's been in
[3941.24 --> 3944.68]  One place ever. I think anyway, it was a fun experience
[3944.68 --> 3948.20]  Not too many people do use them but now that I do
[3948.84 --> 3955.40]  Honestly, it is very hard for me to imagine going back being able to have a display this size
[3955.72 --> 3959.72]  That folds up and fits into your pocket is pretty amazing and google
[3960.12 --> 3963.96]  Has thrown their hat into the foldable ring with the pixel fold
[3964.44 --> 3969.56]  It offers a full 7.6 inch immersive display when it's unfolded and
[3969.56 --> 3975.64]  They've done a pretty tremendous job actually of the aspect ratio of the front screen
[3975.64 --> 3978.52]  That's something that some other foldable devices
[3979.72 --> 3982.44]  Can struggle with a little bit in terms of cramped keyboards
[3983.08 --> 3986.28]  This is a much more comfortable typing experience
[3986.68 --> 3990.28]  So now multitasking on your mobile device is easier than ever
[3990.76 --> 3998.36]  Split screen lets you do two things at once such as creating youtube shorts browsing the internet or referencing business emails
[3998.36 --> 4003.24]  And again as a as a a daily foldable phone user

[4189.16 --> 4194.92]  First, I got to talk about merch not messages. That's right live unboxing luke. Are you ready? Yes
[4194.92 --> 4201.16]  Okay, cuz you're doing it and dan's gonna be on the camera. Oh boy. I love you guys are gonna you guys are gonna somehow
[4201.72 --> 4205.00]  Surprise me and be half competent at this for a change

[4210.20 --> 4215.16]  You got dan moving the camera all over the place. I remember and then you've got my job
[4215.16 --> 4220.52]  I'm just gonna move it out of the camera. No, that is not your job. Your job is to hold it still
[4221.32 --> 4225.64]  And dan your job is to not chase it too much. I mean chase it a little
[4226.84 --> 4228.84]  Dan
[4229.08 --> 4231.08]  Dan
[4231.16 --> 4233.16]  Dang it dan what's happening

[4240.76 --> 4244.76]  You guys are both killing me
[4244.76 --> 4250.76]  What what what am I doing? Okay, we're good. Oh my god. Is that what I'm doing? Stop it
[4251.72 --> 4255.64]  Okay, you guys can't do that. You're gonna give people motion sickness. Okay. Okay, Dan
[4255.64 --> 4258.52]  You have to move to the right. You got to move to the right
[4259.72 --> 4263.32]  Yes, I want it centered in the frame. Don't forget. There's a lower third. Oh
[4264.84 --> 4268.44]  My god, I just got signed out of my google account
[4268.44 --> 4272.60]  Technically, this is the best time for that to happen. I don't even have the dog
[4274.12 --> 4275.56]  um
[4275.72 --> 4278.92]  Oh, man, I think I remember I think I remember this password
[4280.68 --> 4282.12]  Oh
[4282.36 --> 4289.08]  Okay, all right. I think I'm back in the dark anyway, we are finally launching it the ltt stubby screwdriver
[4290.20 --> 4293.56]  And I've got all the dates and everything it is going to be available at
[4293.56 --> 4299.24]  LTX we'll have all we have all four launch versions to show here on the wan show
[4299.88 --> 4305.72]  Um, they're going to be in limited quantities at ltx and the online launch is coming august 17th. Luke
[4305.72 --> 4310.12]  Do you want to start unboxing it sure you can sign up for a launch notification at lmg.gg
[4310.52 --> 4313.72]  Stubby are you not going to comment on sarah's packaging or anything? It looks very nice
[4313.72 --> 4319.32]  I do also believe there would be a cardboard box of bits here six bits six bits so it comes with six bits
[4319.64 --> 4321.64]  It's a six bit driver. It looks very very
[4322.36 --> 4329.48]  Reminiscent of the full-size screwdriver. I make sense. Yeah, it's the same box. Yeah. Well. No, it's smaller smaller. It's not the same box
[4329.64 --> 4332.92]  Yeah, it's a smaller box, but it is the same ratchet correct. Yes
[4333.96 --> 4335.96]  Exactly the same ratchet
[4336.44 --> 4338.44]  Same high quality knurling
[4339.56 --> 4345.72]  New tooling for the the shorter handle obviously and we had to do some work to get the same
[4346.28 --> 4353.40]  Pop-up bit storage mechanism on the much much smaller driver. Oh, I guess I asked you to do the unboxing
[4353.96 --> 4355.96]  Um, go ahead. You can talk
[4357.32 --> 4361.80]  Oh, no, it's fine. Yeah, yeah, this feels about the same, but it's half which makes sense
[4361.80 --> 4366.52]  So there's six instead of twelve, uh, but it still pops in and pops out this will right now
[4366.52 --> 4369.64]  It's like taking a little bit, but these work in slightly over time
[4369.64 --> 4372.60]  So as you use it, it'll be it'll be a little bit less stiff the
[4373.24 --> 4377.24]  Selector I think is identical. Is it even the same size? It is the same
[4377.24 --> 4381.24]  And that's because the ratchet is identical i'm assuming so it goes around it
[4381.32 --> 4384.04]  And i've got something really exciting to show the people
[4384.52 --> 4389.64]  Do you notice anything different about the one that I am handing you now?
[4389.64 --> 4395.08]  No way, okay, so there's a black shaft one
[4397.32 --> 4398.44]  So for the people that uh
[4399.24 --> 4405.80]  Wanted to get the black shaft one of the of the full-sized you will now be able to get a stubby in the same
[4406.52 --> 4409.56]  Shaft color as the main full-size screwdriver that you had
[4409.56 --> 4412.28]  I had no idea we were doing this actually or if you happen
[4412.36 --> 4417.64]  Yeah, if you already have the black shaft full-sized one and you like the patina
[4417.64 --> 4422.04]  Then you can have more patina this time smaller patina
[4422.04 --> 4425.00]  Uh, so there's a total of four skews available
[4425.00 --> 4426.12]  Oh
[4426.12 --> 4431.08]  Everything is fine. Yeah black and orange plastics with a silver shaft
[4431.40 --> 4436.76]  Um black and black plastics with a silver shaft and then black and orange with a black shaft and all black
[4436.76 --> 4441.80]  Blackout edition with the black shaft and all black plastics. Oh my goodness
[4442.36 --> 4444.36]  Uh, that's okay. I'm back to the wide cam
[4445.00 --> 4449.80]  And yes, yeah, they do they do stand up that would have my goodness been a lot easier there you go
[4450.76 --> 4456.68]  Really really excited to finally launch this um, you know guys. I know it seems like a simple thing
[4456.68 --> 4460.12]  Like what like you just oh whoops that not that
[4460.12 --> 4461.08]  Oh, great
[4461.08 --> 4463.08]  Oh, very good. Oh, I got this
[4463.08 --> 4467.72]  It seems like a simple thing never done this before like it's the same screwdriver, but smaller
[4468.28 --> 4471.96]  Right, but that's a lot smaller, but if you want it to be right
[4473.56 --> 4474.60]  Dang it you have to
[4475.56 --> 4480.44]  It takes a lot of work. Okay, gotta make sure that you know when you change the handle
[4480.44 --> 4483.96]  It doesn't change the tolerances somewhere else. You got to make sure that
[4483.96 --> 4488.44]  Uh, you we man we went back and forth a lot on whether it should have knurling at all
[4489.88 --> 4495.32]  Because if you notice like one handing the knurling it's it's you can do it, but it's it's cramped for sure
[4495.32 --> 4500.36]  Yeah, compared to the full size, but then we're looking at it going everything is going to be cramped compared to the full size on this one
[4500.36 --> 4505.88]  That's kind of the whole point. I like the knurling because like if I I can technically get there
[4506.12 --> 4512.84]  Yeah, and uh, if if there was a bit in there as well, it would give it slightly more. Yep, so it would it would work
[4512.84 --> 4518.68]  Yeah, it's it's it's nice. It's nice to have I prefer it. Um, I I advocated for having the knurling on it
[4519.56 --> 4524.12]  We know that it's not the shortest stubby screwdriver in the market, but we
[4525.80 --> 4531.32]  Just were not in a position where we were going to be able to re-engineer the ratchet and make it significantly smaller
[4531.88 --> 4535.48]  So knowing I think keeping the same ratchet was was worth the size
[4536.68 --> 4541.56]  I think so too. I also think six bits is going to accomplish a lot of what people are looking to do
[4541.56 --> 4546.76]  Yeah, given how many people say that the robertson bits that we include with the main screwdriver are useless anyway
[4547.00 --> 4548.52]  That's already three of the 12
[4548.52 --> 4550.52]  Yeah, then again people can build their own kits
[4551.08 --> 4557.24]  And they can have their own bit sets or whatever with the full size screwdriver anyway, and so some people will build out like torques or
[4557.96 --> 4560.52]  Imperial hacks or metric hacks or whatever the case may be. Yeah
[4561.00 --> 4565.00]  You might want to customize the the loadout, but I think with six
[4565.32 --> 4568.44]  Especially with something like this feels a little bit more specialized. Oh, yeah
[4568.44 --> 4574.76]  I think the bits are listed on the back of the box there. So yeah, the included ones are philips 0 philips 1 philips 2
[4575.40 --> 4581.88]  Slot 4 slot 6 and our classic magnet bit. Yeah, that's gonna get a lot of what you're gonna try to do
[4581.88 --> 4583.88]  Yeah, it's a pretty pretty sensible
[4583.96 --> 4589.40]  Pretty sensible one. So just head to lmg.gg slash stubby and you will get a launch notification
[4589.96 --> 4590.68]  um
[4590.68 --> 4592.68]  it's not gonna be cheap because
[4592.68 --> 4597.88]  guys the only difference in cost for us is six fewer bits which is
[4598.84 --> 4602.04]  not that much of the cost of a screwdriver and
[4602.92 --> 4604.92]  And a few cents less of plastic
[4605.56 --> 4608.68]  And a few cents less of metal. Yeah, so it's
[4609.56 --> 4612.12]  Not gonna be the same ratchet is in there
[4613.96 --> 4617.32]  The same high-end tooling from itd
[4617.32 --> 4623.48]  It was paid for yeah less of it because we didn't have to reshoot the you know
[4623.48 --> 4626.28]  The end cap and the selector ring and all that kind of stuff
[4626.28 --> 4631.08]  But we did have to we did have to redesign for the new handle. So that was expensive
[4632.52 --> 4635.88]  Gotta pay for it somehow, but um yeah, I'm very very excited
[4637.72 --> 4640.44]  Yes, the bits are identical to the standard screwdriver
[4640.44 --> 4643.32]  So they are the same shorty bits as we call them
[4643.32 --> 4645.32]  Uh, in other news
[4645.88 --> 4647.48]  Also happening at ltx is
[4648.28 --> 4649.32]  LTX
[4649.32 --> 4653.96]  So for the merch online orders will be available until friday july 28th at 3 p.m.
[4653.96 --> 4658.20]  So if you are not a float plane ten dollar to your member yet
[4659.56 --> 4664.60]  Now is the time to become one if you want to order any of the ltx exclusive merch

[4667.00 --> 4670.60]  But hopefully I can find that for you guys extremely quickly here
[4670.60 --> 4672.84]  So you can see if any of that appeals to you
[4672.84 --> 4679.08]  You will also be entitled if you are at the ten dollar tier to a digital pass which gets you access to

[4686.28 --> 4687.96]  Producing while we are at the show
[4688.76 --> 4690.68]  Uh, let me just see. I do not
[4691.72 --> 4693.48]  I do not know how to find the merch
[4694.68 --> 4700.44]  Is it through by tickets? Ah, yes, here we go. All right, cool. So here's ltx 2023 exclusive
[4700.44 --> 4702.44]  I think it's
[4702.44 --> 4704.44]  You gotta log in
[4704.44 --> 4706.44]  Dang it. Dang it. Dang it. Dang it. Well, okay fine
[4707.48 --> 4709.48]  We've got these cool desk pads
[4710.36 --> 4714.92]  Vancouver dinosaur and I think this is called like zero gravity or something like that
[4714.92 --> 4722.68]  What a professional. If you want to do some browser typing go to ltxtstore.com slash collections slash ltx dash exclusive
[4722.68 --> 4724.68]  I think it's
[4724.68 --> 4726.68]  I think it's
[4726.68 --> 4728.68]  Nice
[4728.68 --> 4730.76]  There we go designer series desk pads
[4731.40 --> 4739.96]  Available in these three super cool styles. We've also got the tie-dye ltx shirt. Look at riley. Thanks for modeling for us riley
[4740.44 --> 4745.80]  Love loved it. Love to see it. Uh, same thing in a hoodie man. This hoodie looks so cool
[4745.80 --> 4747.80]  Enamel pin whale plushie whale keychain
[4748.52 --> 4751.72]  passport and ltx 2023 flag
[4754.12 --> 4760.44]  All right, I think I just have one last one last thing to chuck in here. Oh, yes, we have a backpack update
[4760.76 --> 4766.84]  We have removed the stands on its own messaging from our marketing on the page because we've seen a lot of feedback from buyers
[4767.16 --> 4769.80]  That this feature really depends on how you load the bag
[4770.36 --> 4773.72]  So for example, if you have a bunch of stuff in the front and only a little in the back
[4774.20 --> 4777.88]  Then it's not going to hold that form and it's not going to stand
[4778.84 --> 4780.36]  There's no changes to the product
[4780.36 --> 4784.68]  But we've removed that messaging based on feedback from buyers and we just want to be transparent about all of that
[4785.72 --> 4787.72]  All right, want to hit us with some merch messages, Dan?
[4787.72 --> 4789.72]  Yeah, sure. I've got quite a few here
[4789.72 --> 4795.72]  Um, let's see hello lld will the ltd screwdriver be available to use bits from ifixit
[4795.72 --> 4801.56]  Will the oops, sorry. Oh that I um, I spaced for a second there
[4801.56 --> 4805.08]  Will the ltd screwdriver be able to use bits from ice fixit?
[4805.08 --> 4810.20]  Well, they're a standard quarter-inch hex, so they will use any standard quarter-inch hex anything
[4810.68 --> 4817.24]  But I actually told a big fat lie a second ago when I said that I had no more merch updates because
[4817.88 --> 4823.16]  This is the reason you actually saw me driving the opposite direction when you were on your way to the studio
[4823.16 --> 4828.60]  To start the WAN show mr. Luke Luke does not care. I'm busy doing work
[4829.24 --> 4835.24]  Okay, we're both busy doing work. Yeah, well complain to my boss all three of us are busy doing work believe it or not
[4835.96 --> 4838.44]  This is work. Oh, sorry. I was watching youtube
[4841.96 --> 4845.64]  Okay, sorry what's going on you're showing me the thing that you wouldn't show me earlier. Yeah, I'm showing you the thing dan
[4845.64 --> 4848.04]  You might need to uh, man the camera again. Oh boy
[4848.04 --> 4850.04]  I
[4850.20 --> 4856.04]  Inside this ifixit pro tech 64-bit tool kit is something very special
[4860.76 --> 4862.76]  Okay
[4866.12 --> 4869.32]  Oh man, you guys are you guys are hilarious
[4870.84 --> 4874.52]  I love it. We're gonna do it right above all of the stubby. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah do it
[4874.52 --> 4876.52]  Which they can't see because the lower third but that's okay
[4877.80 --> 4880.52]  What? Okay, that's cool
[4883.00 --> 4888.92]  Okay, so there's a couple really they put tape on it okay, you can put down the line us you can put down tape in the
[4889.24 --> 4893.64]  The thing in your left hand and you can remove the tape. That's your right hand good gravy
[4893.64 --> 4896.68]  I thought you said there's a couple things though. So I was looking for the other thing. No, no, no, it's this
[4896.68 --> 4898.68]  So
[4900.52 --> 4905.16]  We are have been working for some time on a precision driver
[4905.80 --> 4909.80]  And there are a couple of things that are special about this particular precision driver
[4909.80 --> 4914.84]  One of them luke has figured out that's very quickly here. I enjoy that. Um, it will feature
[4920.84 --> 4921.96]  Uh, yeah, you could do that
[4923.48 --> 4923.80]  Sure
[4923.80 --> 4928.36]  Uh, it might not spin as well anymore, but
[4929.24 --> 4929.96]  The point is
[4931.08 --> 4934.92]  The plan right now is for it to have a hybrid ceramic bearing in the top
[4935.56 --> 4941.48]  Uh, we're also working potentially on a weighted top so that it will double as a fidget toy
[4941.96 --> 4946.28]  Right now that one is improperly balanced and installed by hand. So my expectation
[4947.00 --> 4951.80]  My expectation is that the final one will actually run for a fair bit longer than that
[4951.80 --> 4956.60]  Also, there's a fun little surprise if you just pull on your fidget toy
[4957.64 --> 4957.96]  Oh
[4957.96 --> 4958.92]  Oh
[4958.92 --> 4959.64]  Cool
[4959.64 --> 4960.20]  Wow
[4960.20 --> 4961.32]  Inhandle bit storage
[4961.32 --> 4964.76]  Wow, I did not expect that at all. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. There you go
[4966.12 --> 4968.84]  Inhandle bit storage in the same way. So three bits I think
[4968.84 --> 4971.96]  It's one of those things where it's not strictly speaking
[4972.52 --> 4973.72]  Necessary
[4973.72 --> 4977.08]  Because you're probably going to have your kit nearby anyway, right?
[4977.08 --> 4981.00]  But personally I find okay, I can go back to the wide now
[4981.16 --> 4985.24]  I find that when i'm working on a project the odds are pretty good
[4985.80 --> 4987.24]  That i'm there's going to be a few bits
[4987.88 --> 4992.12]  That i'm going to use a lot and the rest of it. I can probably just put aside
[4992.52 --> 4993.88]  And so this is
[4993.88 --> 4999.56]  Somewhere for people like me to put them so they don't get lost while i'm working on a project
[4999.56 --> 5002.52]  And so that I don't have to have the whole bit set next to me
[5002.92 --> 5009.32]  Um, so I made the mistake of with one of the earlier prototypes putting my three most commonly used bits in the handle
[5009.32 --> 5011.00]  And I can see they're missing from my kit now
[5011.32 --> 5016.28]  Uh, because I think the creator warehouse team swapped out my earlier prototype with this one
[5016.60 --> 5017.80]  But what do you think of the finish?
[5018.52 --> 5020.60]  Yeah, it feels very nice. It feels very premium
[5021.16 --> 5024.44]  Um, the the top is extremely distracting
[5024.44 --> 5033.64]  Um, I was I was very surprised I tried to like turn it normally and it just like free spun and I was like, whoa
[5034.20 --> 5038.84]  Yeah, um, but because I was trying to see like can I rotate it because it has a function as well, right?
[5038.84 --> 5040.60]  Yeah, yeah, it's a fun little fidget toy
[5040.60 --> 5047.48]  But also you palm the screwdriver or put it somewhere in your hand and then you can spin it freely from here
[5047.88 --> 5054.04]  Which is the the nice part of this type of thing or you can spin it like that etc. It makes it very very easy to turn in the hand
[5054.76 --> 5056.76]  So is this a standalone thing?
[5056.76 --> 5063.16]  Um, we're not a hundred percent sure yet right now. It's a thing we're working on making as good as we can
[5063.72 --> 5069.08]  And we're gonna figure out what pricing looks like we're gonna figure out you know what exactly the function is
[5069.64 --> 5071.64]  um, you know right now
[5071.88 --> 5078.84]  I'd be i'd be pretty stoked if we just you know could deliver a premium driver that if people wanted to upgrade their iFixit kit
[5078.92 --> 5081.72]  Like i've had a lot of people ask like now that you guys make tools, you know
[5081.72 --> 5084.28]  Where's your relationship with iFixit at and i'm like fine?
[5084.28 --> 5086.76]  I think I mean it's kind of up to them at this point
[5086.76 --> 5091.88]  But like I don't see any reason for people to stop buying iFixit tools just because we have tools
[5091.88 --> 5094.68]  And I don't think this is a direct competitor for their tools either
[5095.00 --> 5099.24]  Would you provide the three bits that you most use along with this?
[5099.40 --> 5101.24]  No, probably not because
[5101.32 --> 5106.20]  When it comes to precision drivers the three bits you most use is going to be you know, whatever right?
[5106.20 --> 5112.12]  So I think our expectation is that either we will create a bit kit and then you can use it along with you know
[5112.36 --> 5114.12]  all your zillion other
[5114.12 --> 5119.80]  I fix it things that exist or their replacement parts and guides and you know, whatever else
[5120.28 --> 5127.32]  uh, or we'll do just the driver and we'll intend it as like a premium upgrade for your existing iFixit kit or
[5127.72 --> 5134.20]  Or any other kit that uses this same I forget the exact I forget the size of of these bits like something
[5134.84 --> 5137.16]  uh, what are they like eighth inch or
[5137.96 --> 5139.88]  formula, I don't even know what they are
[5139.88 --> 5143.72]  But anything else that uses these same size bits would also be compatible
[5143.72 --> 5149.72]  So yeah, mine just I have it just sitting in my iFixit kit ready to ready to go at a moment's notice. That's sick
[5150.12 --> 5154.68]  Yeah, very very excited got so much in the works right now
[5156.04 --> 5159.40]  No, it's not an official iFixit collab. It's just an ltt product
[5162.92 --> 5164.92]  Very cool
[5166.44 --> 5168.92]  All right, sorry dan hit me with a merch message sure thing
[5169.88 --> 5175.56]  Hello, luke given that the expo hall closes at 6. Do you think linus will actually be on time for the wan show?
[5175.88 --> 5181.80]  And will be will we be able to submit merch messages at the store booth at ltx during wan?
[5182.60 --> 5183.56]  We talked about that
[5184.20 --> 5188.68]  The answer is no. Well, okay. Sorry. The answer is yes. We will be on time
[5189.80 --> 5192.68]  But as for whether people can submit merch messages in person
[5193.08 --> 5196.12]  The answer is no, uh, nick actually proposed it to me
[5196.12 --> 5200.20]  He proposed a method by which we could do it where people would write them down
[5201.08 --> 5203.08]  There's another way to do it too. Um
[5203.80 --> 5209.00]  The answer is still no, I just I don't think the logistics makes sense and there's going to be
[5209.72 --> 5212.28]  so many there will literally be thousands
[5212.92 --> 5221.32]  If the merge sales or anything like the previous ltx and so you're just going to have people tiring out their wrists for essentially nothing because we're going to get to a small fraction of them
[5221.32 --> 5225.72]  And it also means that like if your wrists get tired from that like
[5226.36 --> 5230.60]  Well, maybe go to physio don't forget about the other people whose wrists might get tired
[5231.16 --> 5234.28]  If they have to deal with that many merch messages. So there it's just
[5235.00 --> 5237.80]  For practical reasons. I just don't think it makes any sense
[5239.08 --> 5239.96]  All right, hit me again
[5240.76 --> 5244.92]  Sure about a year ago. My brother asked if you would ever make a deodorant
[5244.92 --> 5249.16]  He has not stopped asking me to ask you again. Have you had a change of heart?
[5250.12 --> 5250.28]  No
[5250.28 --> 5256.12]  Um, the reason that I haven't is that when it comes to anything to do with
[5256.68 --> 5258.92]  um ingesting something or
[5259.56 --> 5262.12]  smearing it all over your skin and potential
[5262.92 --> 5268.76]  Allergies and liability and uh, mr beast this is this is this is hilarious to me
[5269.32 --> 5273.80]  Maybe it's not hilarious to him, but he actually went on the record recently
[5273.80 --> 5278.36]  Um, hold on. I'm just gonna make sure that this is actually true. Not just something I heard
[5279.40 --> 5279.96]  Um
[5279.96 --> 5280.44]  Good idea
[5283.24 --> 5286.20]  Someone in full plane chat though, uh, I don't know how to say it
[5286.20 --> 5287.56]  K-chirpaj
[5289.48 --> 5289.96]  Sorry, I
[5290.68 --> 5293.48]  K-c-h-e-r-p-j
[5294.76 --> 5295.64]  K-chirpaj
[5296.20 --> 5298.68]  Okay, it says legal minefields and yeah, agreed
[5299.40 --> 5299.88]  Um
[5299.88 --> 5300.44]  Um
[5302.12 --> 5306.76]  Oh, okay. June 17th. Mr. Beast announced the end of mr. Beast burger
[5307.72 --> 5308.84]  Uh, so there you go
[5309.40 --> 5313.24]  Uh, what I had actually heard before that is um
[5314.76 --> 5320.36]  Is that he would close it down if he could or something along those lines and um
[5322.04 --> 5322.84]  I told you so
[5322.84 --> 5325.48]  Like
[5325.48 --> 5330.60]  And and it's funny because his his tweet about it is almost word for word
[5331.56 --> 5332.36]  Exactly
[5332.36 --> 5333.08]  What I said
[5333.96 --> 5340.12]  You can't guarantee the quality of the order and when you're working with other restaurants, it's impossible to control
[5340.12 --> 5340.60]  whereas
[5341.16 --> 5345.56]  Uh, you know, he's finding feastables much more manageable, which is which is great
[5345.56 --> 5350.84]  Um, and just the the liability of of a thing people eat
[5351.32 --> 5356.12]  That you have no direct control over the quality of is just uh, it's just terrifying to me
[5356.44 --> 5359.08]  And even if it is something prepackaged
[5359.64 --> 5362.28]  Whether it's a feastables or a deodorant, i'm not saying never
[5362.92 --> 5364.92]  Anything is possible in the future. I just
[5366.52 --> 5368.04]  It gives me the heebie-jeebies man
[5368.04 --> 5372.04]  Like I I saw beast burger and I just went that's wild good luck
[5372.04 --> 5377.16]  You know, I hope I hope I really hope actually that it's a huge success
[5377.40 --> 5383.16]  And you make lots of money and people get a lot of delicious food and all of this goes well, but I just
[5384.44 --> 5388.36]  It's not something that I'm exploring. It's not something I'm trying to explore
[5388.92 --> 5392.04]  Jaden said in flow point chat, uh, but eddie burback has a
[5392.52 --> 5399.48]  Actually, very very good video on these ghost restaurants that do stuff like, you know beast burger or whatever else
[5399.48 --> 5403.80]  Yeah, they make a bunch like there'll be one restaurant that isn't actually a restaurant
[5403.80 --> 5407.56]  It's a warehouse somewhere that no one can actually go to yeah, and they just
[5408.28 --> 5409.40]  create
[5409.40 --> 5411.40]  food for these various
[5411.80 --> 5419.24]  Customers which are not like you it's some brand that wants to have their name out there and they'll have options that are like
[5419.80 --> 5421.24]  hot wings
[5421.24 --> 5426.04]  And they make the exact same hot wings for like 27 different restaurants if you're ordering through an app on your phone
[5426.04 --> 5432.20]  Um, so they're like is no difference in a lot of cases unless you're ordering from established restaurants that have storefronts, right?
[5432.52 --> 5436.44]  There's a bunch of them around here actually. Yeah, one of the ways to figure it out is google maps the address
[5437.16 --> 5438.60]  Yeah
[5438.60 --> 5443.00]  Yeah, I mean I think if we ever did a food establishment, I think i've talked to you about this before
[5443.00 --> 5446.20]  I would want there to be some kind of like really fun gimmick
[5446.60 --> 5449.32]  Uh, I remember I remember pitching a bunch of different ideas
[5449.32 --> 5454.76]  Yeah, I pitched one to you a long time ago where the idea was that everything was like really messy to eat
[5455.24 --> 5458.92]  And it was supposed to be like a like a great place to go for a first date night
[5458.92 --> 5460.92]  Yeah, um just to be an icebreaker
[5461.24 --> 5465.08]  So that everyone is going to be awkward and there's kind of like nothing you can do about it
[5465.08 --> 5470.36]  So like the sandwiches are all definitely too tall to like fit to fit in your mouth
[5470.36 --> 5477.88]  Like don't give you a knife so you can't cut it. Yeah, you know the the spaghetti the spaghetti bowl is literally one long noodle
[5477.88 --> 5481.40]  And you have a spoon and you have a spoon, you know like
[5482.92 --> 5485.32]  Like intentionally going hard mode just
[5486.12 --> 5488.52]  You know just discuss to like loot box get some laughs
[5488.84 --> 5494.84]  Yeah, we did we talked like you have to order like you order like a veggie and a protein and what comes out is just what comes out
[5495.40 --> 5500.12]  And we try to bring out like really random weird stuff for fun. Yeah, I think something like that would be really fun
[5500.12 --> 5506.36]  But the the only way that I would do something like that would be if I had direct oversight and
[5506.36 --> 5510.20]  you know, I look at how hard it is to control the quality of a video
[5512.84 --> 5519.64]  And the risk associated with delivering you know a video that has some deficiency that i'm not happy with and I look at food
[5519.64 --> 5520.68]  I'm like, yeah, man
[5520.68 --> 5521.64]  I don't know
[5521.64 --> 5523.88]  Yeah, kind of terrifying
[5523.88 --> 5528.68]  That's pretty that's pretty tough. That's pretty tough. I think I just uh, I think I just won't do that
[5529.00 --> 5531.96]  But you know anyway, you know what the thing about jimmy is that
[5532.68 --> 5533.96]  You can't deny his passion
[5534.44 --> 5539.24]  He's he's excited. He he wants to build things. He wants to try things
[5540.20 --> 5543.48]  And I think a lot of people forget that he is really young
[5544.12 --> 5548.28]  We talked about this when um when we did that topic like a few months ago
[5548.28 --> 5550.60]  It was like mr. Beast for president or something like that
[5551.16 --> 5552.12]  um, you know, he's
[5552.12 --> 5555.32]  He's really young. I think his heart's in the right place
[5555.32 --> 5560.52]  I don't think he did any of this with the intention of screwing anyone over or anything like that
[5561.24 --> 5563.72]  when he first started beast burger people were
[5564.52 --> 5565.80]  asking for
[5565.80 --> 5568.36]  Companies like his to show up to save restaurants. Yep
[5568.60 --> 5572.20]  So like it and then it shifted that whole conversation shifted to like oh
[5572.60 --> 5579.00]  Now you're killing restaurants because there's like too many of these ghost restaurant things and it's reducing orders from from normal
[5579.00 --> 5581.72]  Legitimized restaurants and like all this like it yeah
[5581.88 --> 5585.72]  Just because the conversation changed doesn't mean that it was one thing at one time
[5586.36 --> 5590.60]  Um, so yeah, I don't know. There's a lot of support for beast burger when it first popped up
[5591.00 --> 5594.92]  And I've got people saying he's got too much money and doesn't know what to do with it. No, he doesn't
[5595.64 --> 5599.72]  I think he knows what to do with it. Yeah, he knows exactly what to do with it build his business
[5599.80 --> 5603.08]  And it's not too much. I don't think someone like that could have too much
[5603.64 --> 5605.64]  uh, like
[5605.64 --> 5607.64]  Obviously like to to
[5607.64 --> 5612.36]  Eventually, yes, but right now. No, I I actually believe that he is dumping
[5613.48 --> 5620.76]  Most of what he brings in right back into the business to make the most compelling content that uh appeals to his audience
[5623.24 --> 5625.32]  All right, uh, oh another merch message
[5625.64 --> 5629.88]  Sure last one for you guys you hinted at getting an x-ray machine for labs
[5629.88 --> 5635.72]  I repair them and take images of my tools for testing, but I wish I could bring my camera or a printer in
[5636.28 --> 5640.20]  What would you want to get imaged first? Oh, wow?
[5641.24 --> 5646.44]  What would I image in an x-ray machine? I mean, I think we'd have to do something totally self-serving like the screwdriver
[5647.64 --> 5652.92]  Oh, sorry to to send out a you know promoted tweet or something like that. Yeah, that'd be sweet
[5652.92 --> 5657.88]  Yeah, I I want to jump back temporarily to the previous topic that eddie uh
[5658.92 --> 5659.72]  Burback video
[5660.36 --> 5665.72]  He went into a lot of things that were really interesting and something that you were just talking about with food quality and being
[5666.20 --> 5669.08]  unable to insure it one of the problems with the
[5669.96 --> 5676.04]  Ubiquitousness of all these crazy ghost restaurants going all over the place is that like food and drug associations
[5676.04 --> 5684.36]  Are having a really hard time doing investigations for food quality for restaurants when they can't even figure out what the address for these places are
[5685.88 --> 5689.16]  Because a lot of times the the address listed isn't even correct
[5690.84 --> 5697.00]  So you would have to be like a delivery driver to get the actual proper address to know where to pick it up
[5698.28 --> 5705.00]  And that makes it really really hard for these places to go do food inspection and they can't even find the damn restaurant
[5705.00 --> 5709.56]  So yeah, that was kind of a big deal. I haven't watched in a while, but it's a great video. You should check it out
[5709.56 --> 5712.76]  What would what what would your choice of food product for us be?
[5715.80 --> 5718.20]  I already know my answer. So if you need some time I can do mine
[5718.84 --> 5725.40]  Do yours. I have no idea. I would like to make the tastiest crunchiest perfectest breakfast cereal
[5725.80 --> 5730.20]  Oh, that's pretty good that one. Yeah, that I was not on that track, but that's pretty good
[5730.20 --> 5733.88]  It would it lines up with what I wanted because I was gonna say something
[5733.88 --> 5738.28]  It should be something that isn't like fresh so we could sell it through LTT store effectively and ship it
[5738.52 --> 5741.32]  The problem is that breakfast cereals like bulky
[5742.60 --> 5748.12]  Like who's gonna buy breakfast cereal online? That's like stupid totally a whole they literally sponsor us. Yeah
[5748.84 --> 5750.76]  I don't know like twice. Are they still around?
[5751.32 --> 5752.76]  Yeah. Oh, okay
[5752.76 --> 5755.00]  It's a very it's a challenging business
[5755.00 --> 5757.88]  So the one that I know of has been around for quite a while. Okay
[5758.52 --> 5764.20]  When you're up against you know a four dollar box of you know lucky charms or whatever in the grocery store
[5764.52 --> 5767.08]  It's a lot more than that now actually. Well, hold on a second
[5767.64 --> 5769.72]  Canadian. Yes general it's like seven
[5770.04 --> 5773.00]  Canadian dollars now, but in the us I bet it's still cheap
[5774.12 --> 5779.56]  I always just assume things cost nothing in the us and that has changed a lot over the last few years
[5779.56 --> 5785.00]  So sometimes my assumptions can end up a little bit out of whack lucky charms cereal. Okay, here we go
[5785.48 --> 5787.48]  It also depends on the size
[5787.56 --> 5793.00]  Yeah, you can get lucky charms for like five bucks. Yeah, but that's how much how many grams that's family size
[5793.80 --> 5795.80]  Okay, it's america. I looked up. Oh
[5796.60 --> 5801.16]  Here's a ten and a half ounce for four dollars. I am I am not you can go. I am not
[5801.16 --> 5806.44]  Bill Gates thinking bananas are seven dollars. I thought you were talking I thought you were talking about Canadian. I win!
[5807.08 --> 5809.08]  I was right!
[5809.40 --> 5818.20]  You can get you can get a box of lucky charms in Canada for five bucks, but it's 300 grams. Yeah, that's so that's one bowl for the
[5818.20 --> 5820.20]  Linus. Yeah, yeah
[5820.20 --> 5824.28]  It's the big cereal. No, no, that's not how I do that anymore. No, right now
[5824.28 --> 5829.08]  That's like four bowls that I pour in little tiny portions
[5830.52 --> 5832.84]  So that I can eat it as crunchily as possible
[5833.40 --> 5838.44]  Okay, so the strat has improved with the volumes the same. Yeah, I do enjoy the strat. Yeah
[5839.00 --> 5843.16]  Probably the worst cereal for me is honeycomb. Have you ever eaten a bowl of honeycomb?
[5843.16 --> 5845.08]  It just like immediately sogs, doesn't it?
[5845.08 --> 5846.36]  No, well, it's not that no, no
[5846.36 --> 5849.88]  It's fine because I just pour like a like a tiny quarter of a bowl and eat it
[5849.88 --> 5855.08]  I just mean the sheer volume of it that you can eat in one sitting because it's basically air
[5857.88 --> 5863.16]  Like what can you eat more of honeycomb or like lettuce, you know like just I don't know a celery
[5863.64 --> 5865.24]  I could actually
[5865.24 --> 5870.12]  Like I probably couldn't consume celery fast enough for my body to process it
[5870.68 --> 5874.60]  Or for my body to to fall behind in processing it like it would be wild
[5874.60 --> 5877.48]  I could just sit on the toilet and eat celery for the rest of my life
[5878.44 --> 5881.24]  In one end out the other there's a visual for you
[5882.68 --> 5887.48]  Still green and if they could like genetically engineer a long enough celery you could just stuff it all the way through
[5892.20 --> 5899.08]  And Tori asks the big question is cereal or milk first no it isn't that is not a question
[5900.68 --> 5903.72]  Okay, when you're doing these four bowls cereal is food
[5903.72 --> 5910.04]  Do you drink them you decide how much food you eat and then you put the appropriate accompanying amount of milk?
[5910.92 --> 5913.08]  Are you drinking the milk between every bowl?
[5913.08 --> 5916.54]  No, I don't have to because I absolutely nailed the amount of milk every time
[5916.54 --> 5918.54]  This man is a god
[5918.54 --> 5920.54]  Get absolutely f***ing wrecked
[5920.54 --> 5922.30]  That's such a line it's coming
[5922.30 --> 5923.26]  I'm in awe of him
[5924.06 --> 5924.62]  Man
[5927.02 --> 5930.46]  You also have to monitor you have to balance as you go if you can tell
[5930.70 --> 5935.98]  Oh man, I took a really that one bite at the beginning was like loaded with honey nut cheerios
[5935.98 --> 5938.62]  It's amazing how many honey nut cheerios you can fit on one spoon
[5938.62 --> 5943.18]  Right like a man all that early bite okay, I get like two cheerios on this thing of milk milky
[5943.18 --> 5946.78]  I get like three cheerios on this one. Okay, we got this okay more cheerios. Let's go
[5950.06 --> 5953.34]  Cereal strategy anyway, what would be your food item?
[5954.70 --> 5960.18]  I'm really struggling with this because yeah, that's like putting dressing in a bowl and then like adding lettuce to it
[5960.74 --> 5967.24]  Can stupid that's the best comparison I've ever that's the best argument to that that's from Conrad and float plane chat
[5967.24 --> 5972.84]  That's so good. That is good. Like you would actually never be beta enough to do that
[5973.88 --> 5979.40]  Croutons or ranch first you put you put the dressing then you put the croutons
[5979.96 --> 5981.96]  You finally put the greens
[5984.12 --> 5986.60]  It's all the croutons are saying soggy
[5988.12 --> 5990.12]  Before you get to eat
[5991.00 --> 5993.00]  The worst possible way
[5993.00 --> 5998.36]  You're just scooping up ranch from the bottom of the plate. Oh terrible. It's like yeah
[5998.36 --> 6001.96]  I'm just gonna I'm just gonna put some actual cheese in a skillet
[6002.12 --> 6007.96]  And I'm just gonna melt it and then I'll like put bread on it after grilled cheese sandwich because I'm an idiot
[6012.12 --> 6015.88]  Sort of in a way some places do that because they'll take a cheese wheel cut it in half
[6016.28 --> 6018.28]  grill the flat side and then
[6019.08 --> 6025.16]  Shrink onto bread. No, that is a thing that happens. No, no, I think they also cook the bread though to be fair. That's good
[6025.40 --> 6027.40]  I don't know. I can't really think of anything
[6028.36 --> 6031.64]  Because like what we're just gonna like what how many non-perishable things
[6032.28 --> 6037.08]  I would have thought you would do like a like a like a really good protein bar or something like that
[6037.08 --> 6038.28]  I was thinking okay
[6038.28 --> 6043.80]  So someone in the chat said protein powder and I was like no, I was kind of thinking like some form of snack bar
[6043.80 --> 6050.28]  That isn't trash for you because I very recently looked at what's in cliff bars and was highly disappointed. I'm sorry cliff
[6050.60 --> 6051.40]  um
[6051.40 --> 6053.40]  Sorry cliff. Yeah and joe
[6054.12 --> 6056.12]  And sammy. Yeah, yeah
[6058.36 --> 6063.96]  But I I feel like that's like that's such a saturated market that has to has already been done
[6063.96 --> 6069.32]  But I don't know if we get in this hypothetical scenario if we could make one that was better
[6069.32 --> 6071.96]  I mean cereals been done. Yeah chocolate bars have been done
[6072.12 --> 6073.88]  Yeah, I definitely don't want to do a chocolate bar
[6073.88 --> 6078.28]  But yeah, if we could do like a protein bar that tasted good and wasn't trash for you
[6078.52 --> 6080.28]  And like had good macros that'd be cool
[6080.28 --> 6084.36]  I'd be willing to do a chocolate bar, but it would have to be like absolutely incredible
[6085.00 --> 6086.44]  um
[6086.44 --> 6089.40]  And I just don't want to put in the work to do that
[6089.40 --> 6096.84]  Uh, like I I i'm i'm one of those people who if there's chocolate in the house if it's not lindor i'm just not gonna eat it
[6097.24 --> 6097.56]  Yeah
[6097.56 --> 6102.84]  Yeah, bad chocolate is like actually just not worth it at all not calorie worthy. Yeah
[6103.80 --> 6104.12]  um
[6105.32 --> 6106.92]  It's interesting that you chose lindor
[6107.56 --> 6109.32]  Do you?
[6109.32 --> 6113.32]  Why do you think is it the taste or the texture it's the texture i'm a texture person
[6113.32 --> 6117.32]  I was gonna say I prefer lindor because of the texture by like a massive amount
[6117.32 --> 6121.48]  I always put them in the freezer first. I won't even eat them warm. Very good. Yeah, very good
[6121.48 --> 6123.24]  So good because then you can suck on them for longer
[6123.24 --> 6124.84]  I've been
[6124.84 --> 6127.96]  Yeah, I I know lindor is kind of trash like high-end
[6127.96 --> 6129.00]  It's high-end trash
[6129.24 --> 6135.00]  But i'm not willing to spend the kind of money that like real good chocolate costs like if you give me like one of those
[6135.56 --> 6137.80]  70% cocoa bars i'm like
[6140.20 --> 6144.76]  They're like nine dollars each or whatever like yeah, so it's like never gonna happen. Yeah, i'm not gonna do that. I heard
[6144.76 --> 6147.72]  Yeah, and this is the one thing that has made me want to like
[6148.20 --> 6152.20]  Break diet really bad because I want to try it you remember fruit roll-ups
[6152.84 --> 6158.84]  Was it fruit roll-ups fruit by the foot fruit roll-ups not fruit by the foot fruit roll-ups, but particularly so it was kind of like
[6160.12 --> 6163.40]  Shapes that you could poke out of there you can poke the shapes out, but it was like a sheet
[6164.04 --> 6168.44]  Apparently it has some and it was originally intended to be this way and they're just like no one did it
[6168.44 --> 6173.40]  So they didn't bother advertise like this, but apparently it reacts with cold
[6174.20 --> 6177.56]  In a very particular way. So the idea is you put
[6178.36 --> 6186.52]  Ice cream on it and then wrap the fruit roll up around the ice cream and it makes it really crunchy
[6187.16 --> 6191.96]  Yeah, okay. I could see that so you and like but like significantly more than you would expect
[6192.76 --> 6198.04]  Okay, and it becomes hard. So you you bite on it like crystallize or something to a certain degree. I think
[6198.04 --> 6201.08]  And it's supposed to just be like amazing and I want to try it
[6201.64 --> 6205.88]  But I don't even know like where I would buy a fruit roll up people are so just like
[6206.52 --> 6211.56]  Disconnected sometimes box in buddha says lindor is actually one of the lowest quality chocolates
[6212.76 --> 6215.16]  Have you ever had an advent calendar chocolate?
[6216.04 --> 6221.16]  Dude, you can get lint advent calendars. I know you can't but most of them are not. Yes
[6222.12 --> 6227.80]  There's chocolate that actually tastes maybe maybe you're from europe or something like that would explain it
[6228.04 --> 6231.08]  But over here in north america land
[6231.40 --> 6234.92]  We have chocolate that actually tastes more like plastic than cocoa
[6235.48 --> 6239.08]  Oh, it's so bad a lot of it like really a lot. Yeah
[6240.04 --> 6246.68]  You are you are objectively wrong. It is not one of the lowest. It just isn't one of the highest 100%
[6246.68 --> 6250.04]  It's like the kitchen aid of chocolate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[6250.04 --> 6253.56]  I always use kitchen aid like ankles, you know, it's like
[6254.44 --> 6261.72]  It's like the high quality like me but like still very mainstream brand and you could like definitely get better stuff. Yeah, for sure
[6264.60 --> 6268.84]  Yeah, we've got other people backing me up here. Yeah, chocolate sucks in canada 100%
[6269.72 --> 6272.60]  Someone said fruit roll ups are available commonly in all grocery stores in the us
[6272.60 --> 6276.04]  Yeah, I hear that but you got to do to you got to do the perimeter strategy
[6276.04 --> 6282.68]  Just stay away from the bad stuff at the grocery stores. Just only go around the outside. Really? Yeah, I never really thought about that
[6283.40 --> 6286.36]  Yeah, i'm trying i'm thinking about the layout of like the local superstore
[6286.36 --> 6288.12]  so you walk in and
[6288.12 --> 6294.20]  It's not quite perimeter because the entire right side of the store is ghost town. That's superstore though. Yeah, which has like
[6294.20 --> 6300.04]  uh, like housewares and like clothes like cheap clothes and like crap like that. Yeah, but then and
[6300.04 --> 6305.72]  and I think the like the cosmetics and like um pharmacy and stuff are over there. Do they have a pharmacy?
[6305.72 --> 6309.32]  I don't know. They definitely have like personal personal care products and stuff, but if you go straight in
[6309.88 --> 6311.48]  it's veggies
[6311.48 --> 6315.80]  you go straight to the back you end up in cheese and then
[6316.60 --> 6324.36]  um meatland then seafood then you come down this side it's uh juices dairy um
[6324.36 --> 6326.20]  um different cheese
[6327.24 --> 6332.36]  uh like not deli cheese like like packaged cheese if I recall correctly then you end up in the bakery
[6332.92 --> 6334.04]  and then you end up at the till
[6334.76 --> 6338.76]  So you don't see and i'm trying to think about again layout so you've got all your soft drinks
[6338.76 --> 6340.20]  You don't see the like soft drinks
[6340.20 --> 6344.92]  You've got your like cleaning supplies uh pet supplies and then I think it goes into
[6345.40 --> 6349.08]  Well, you miss baking supplies though. Yes, that one is a little and and
[6349.08 --> 6354.44]  And all we don't bake because the birds all the ethnic isles are in there as well
[6354.44 --> 6357.48]  So all the like uh mexican southeast asian
[6357.48 --> 6358.68]  uh indian
[6358.68 --> 6363.08]  I do dip in because I need I I the amount of hot sauce that I go through is absurd
[6363.48 --> 6367.48]  Okay, so I go in to get hot sauce bottles. How's the sriracha shortage treating you by the way?
[6367.48 --> 6373.40]  I do frank's red hot extra hot. Okay, so you don't like everything that jake's like super super torn up about it
[6373.48 --> 6378.68]  Yeah, frank's red hot extra hot specifically. There's like very few actual total ingredients
[6379.08 --> 6381.08]  All the ingredients are chill
[6381.24 --> 6386.12]  Um, and it the I find when it's extra hot. I don't have to use quite as much
[6386.84 --> 6391.96]  Um, I I do I really like the frank's red hot. Uh, what is it?
[6392.84 --> 6400.20]  Lime and something else and are you already you had me at lime so it's so good. Yeah, it just makes everything you're eating tastes like mexican
[6400.20 --> 6402.20]  I'm a boring tabasco boy
[6404.60 --> 6408.68]  Classic tabasco my problem is red peppers and vinegar salt. That's all that's it
[6408.68 --> 6410.92]  I've been eating my like really boring standard
[6411.40 --> 6413.72]  Set up for so long. Of course you have that to
[6414.76 --> 6418.84]  To not be bored out of my mind. I basically have to melt my face off
[6419.32 --> 6422.36]  So I just the entire top of it is just red
[6423.08 --> 6423.80]  Nice
[6423.80 --> 6425.00]  Sometimes blood chicken
[6425.00 --> 6427.16]  Sometimes I will complete with extra hot as well
[6427.16 --> 6429.40]  Not the normal frank's red with frank's red extra hot
[6429.40 --> 6434.12]  I will completely make the top of the chicken red and then flip it to the bottom
[6436.20 --> 6441.16]  So going through the rest of my aisles we've got your breakfast foods that are mostly just like
[6442.36 --> 6445.48]  The story of how oatmeal became breakfast food is hilarious
[6446.04 --> 6450.84]  It's like brilliant marketing because it's essentially gruel which was like poor people garbage food
[6451.32 --> 6454.36]  Um, and then they're like pretty solid or you can eat it for breakfast
[6454.36 --> 6459.72]  It's like a TV commercials. Let's go lobster also used to be poor people food. There you go serve it in prisons
[6459.88 --> 6464.68]  And then cereal aisle I can't miss the cereal aisle so cereal aisle for the grocery store that I go to is
[6465.64 --> 6469.00]  Like the shelves for it are right along the milk
[6469.56 --> 6472.36]  Which kind of makes sense to me so you don't actually have to go to the inside
[6472.36 --> 6476.92]  Yeah, not super story. Yeah, and then after cereal aisle there's like the natural food aisles
[6477.48 --> 6479.48]  uh, which
[6479.48 --> 6486.52]  I can't they just taste so bad all of them literally all of them and then it's like ice cream and frozen goods and then
[6486.76 --> 6492.36]  And then you're and then you're back over to to uh cheese and juices and milk and butter and all that kind of stuff
[6492.68 --> 6496.44]  Yeah, so you're right got a dip in sometimes. Yeah, I miss out on a lot
[6497.00 --> 6503.08]  Yeah, I find like the hot sauce. I know what aisle it's in and I know what end of that aisle it's in
[6503.80 --> 6510.84]  So, you know, you can remove a lot of temptation by just going to only that aisle and only as far in as you need to go
[6511.40 --> 6517.00]  Because a lot of the aisles it's like it feels like it's almost designed to get you lost and trying to find the right thing
[6517.00 --> 6517.32]  Yeah
[6517.32 --> 6522.76]  Stuck in the middle of the store and end up adding a whole bunch of impulse purchases because you're probably hungry because you're out shopping
[6523.32 --> 6524.36]  um
[6524.36 --> 6525.32]  so
[6525.32 --> 6531.32]  Yeah, got some stuff from floatplane chat vng supernova says gruel is not oatmeal. It's far more watery and has no milk
[6531.32 --> 6534.76]  Um, most of the time we make oatmeal without milk here
[6534.84 --> 6538.60]  So this is what this might be one of those things where it's just like a cultural difference
[6539.40 --> 6543.40]  Um, i've never had oatmeal made with milk cream of wheat. Yes
[6544.12 --> 6548.76]  Uh, but even that has instructions on the side of the box for how to make it with water as well
[6548.84 --> 6555.88]  So I guess we're just like disgusting most oatmeal that i've had the vast majority of it has been with water. Yeah, um, but yes
[6555.88 --> 6561.56]  Yes, yes, yes more watery, but then it's still fundamentally the same thing. It's just watered down
[6562.20 --> 6563.96]  um, and then uh
[6563.96 --> 6565.88]  Thysio says apparently
[6565.88 --> 6573.40]  Lobster was ground up shell and everything so not quite the same as what's eaten today. Yeah, but it's still like I mean, it's still lobster, but like
[6574.28 --> 6578.92]  With the shell. Yeah, that's gotta be kind of rough like the antennas and stuff like I don't know
[6578.92 --> 6580.92]  Do they even rip those off? I have no idea. Probably not
[6580.92 --> 6586.12]  Um, yeah, interesting. Yeah, gm shippo says i'm american always used milk
[6586.28 --> 6594.68]  Yeah, that's the thing about america too though is you guys are like so regional dependent. Oh, yeah, like you can go one county over in murica land and
[6596.20 --> 6600.92]  Food's i'm not in kansas anymore. They make pizza in a completely different way now. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[6600.92 --> 6605.48]  Like oh that kind of pizza that's kind of pizza sucks. This is the kind of pizza
[6606.04 --> 6608.04]  Okay, all right, dude
[6608.04 --> 6612.68]  I thought it was just bread and tomato sauce and like whatever you want to put on it. Just calm down
[6614.84 --> 6618.20]  No, no, no, no, no, no people don't eat cereal with water calm down twitch chat
[6618.60 --> 6621.80]  um oatmeal oatmeal like like like the cooked oatmeal
[6622.36 --> 6623.32]  um
[6623.32 --> 6629.08]  Yeah, like breakfast cereal a cold breakfast cereal with water would be something spectacularly awful
[6632.04 --> 6636.12]  Yeah, I really think you'd have to pry my milk from my cold dead hands at this point
[6636.12 --> 6639.40]  I will never drink a glass of milk
[6640.28 --> 6644.20]  But I i've tried cereal with milk substitutes and it is
[6646.20 --> 6653.80]  Everyone who says it's the same it's not the same is um, I was on a very particular brand of almond milk for a while there
[6654.28 --> 6656.92]  And it was not the same, but I liked it because it had vanilla
[6657.56 --> 6661.96]  Stuff in it. I don't like vanilla. Oh, so that's really tough. So we found a thing
[6661.96 --> 6665.64]  I like vanilla and I like ketchup chips. Yeah
[6666.20 --> 6671.64]  So we we do actually disagree about some things. It's very rare that we disagree on on food
[6671.64 --> 6675.72]  But it's very we can pretty much order for each other at restaurants though still yeah
[6676.76 --> 6677.08]  Yeah
[6680.84 --> 6683.56]  Should we do should we do oh we're on two to three topics again
[6684.12 --> 6687.72]  Uh, we have been for 10 minutes. What were we doing? Were we doing merch messages?
[6687.72 --> 6690.12]  I think you've been answering a merch message for the last 20 minutes
[6691.64 --> 6695.56]  I just turn out after a while we're doing glorbo comes to world of warcraft
[6695.56 --> 6702.36]  Let's go the best update wow has ever had promised the people world of warcraft players on reddit have successfully
[6702.60 --> 6709.48]  Honey potted an ai bot that was scraping forums for community discussions to remix into news stories without human input
[6709.80 --> 6713.56]  on thursday a post about a fake new feature called glorbo
[6714.44 --> 6721.48]  became rapidly upvoted with many users adding their own comments about absurd fake features that were supposed
[6721.80 --> 6728.52]  Supposedly being added to the game soon after an article about wows about the wow community's excitement for glorbo
[6728.76 --> 6732.52]  Appeared on z leagues gaming news site the portal
[6733.16 --> 6737.16]  Which incorporated several nonsensical quotes taken directly from the subreddit?
[6737.16 --> 6743.48]  It was listed under the byline of lucy reed who published 83 articles yesterday
[6745.08 --> 6748.84]  Wow lucy you go girl yeah more like lucy right
[6750.84 --> 6752.44]  The article has since been it was okay
[6754.60 --> 6756.60]  That was awesome
[6756.92 --> 6758.92]  Sorry, did you say something where's the punching?
[6758.92 --> 6761.40]  I actually was not listening. I'm so sorry. Oh my goodness
[6761.40 --> 6762.12]  I'm sorry guys
[6762.12 --> 6762.68]  Oh
[6762.68 --> 6766.68]  The article has since been removed, but it's available in archived form
[6767.00 --> 6769.00]  z league has posted
[6769.00 --> 6773.08]  18,512 articles in just over two months
[6774.04 --> 6776.04]  Or an average of
[6776.04 --> 6779.88]  241 articles a day talking about fishing for virality
[6781.24 --> 6783.08]  Oh, man definitely going viral
[6783.64 --> 6787.00]  We're talking about it. The original reddit post was fantastic
[6787.00 --> 6789.72]  Well, i'm so excited. I'll bring it up. I'll bring it up
[6790.84 --> 6794.44]  Okay, the title is i'm so excited. They finally introduced glorbo
[6795.00 --> 6803.16]  Uh, and then honestly this new feature makes me so happy. I just really want some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this
[6804.04 --> 6809.16]  I have to say since they started hitting uh hinting at hearthstone in 1994
[6809.48 --> 6812.84]  It was obvious they would introduce glorbo to world of warcraft sooner or later
[6812.84 --> 6816.84]  I feel like dragon flight has been win after win so far like
[6817.32 --> 6822.36]  When they brought back chen storm stout as the boss at the end of new karazhan
[6822.60 --> 6827.40]  Absolutely amazing feel free to comment below what new features and stories you want to see in the future
[6827.64 --> 6830.76]  Maybe you'll be quoted on some trustworthy news websites as well
[6832.36 --> 6833.32]  Amazing
[6833.32 --> 6839.00]  Uh, literally in the article it included the quote of honestly this new feature makes me so happy
[6839.00 --> 6845.80]  I just really want some major bot operated news websites to publish an article about this that was in the article that was published
[6845.96 --> 6847.96]  Which is amazing
[6848.28 --> 6850.28]  So good
[6850.28 --> 6852.28]  So so good
[6856.76 --> 6857.72]  Is this glorbo?
[6857.72 --> 6860.68]  I was yeah, I was gonna add is that ai art or is that glorbo?
[6860.68 --> 6861.72]  That meme right?
[6861.72 --> 6863.72]  Is this glorbo?
[6865.56 --> 6866.52]  That's fantastic
[6866.52 --> 6867.08]  Um
[6868.60 --> 6870.20]  I anticipated new feature that
[6875.88 --> 6881.88]  Apparently the original post has been updated um cheering for victory in words that I won't say
[6884.20 --> 6887.88]  And talking about how they they updated it and pulled it down and stuff like that
[6887.88 --> 6893.00]  Some players have reservations about the mandatory item click clack and its effect on casual players
[6893.00 --> 6898.68]  Oh man, this is amazing inclusion of clack sigh as a playable phrase
[6901.40 --> 6902.36]  Oh man
[6902.36 --> 6904.44]  All right, this is
[6905.48 --> 6906.60]  This is pretty cool
[6907.72 --> 6911.00]  That's fantastic great work to uh everyone involved
[6912.04 --> 6912.76]  That's a win
[6912.76 --> 6915.32]  Okay
[6915.32 --> 6916.36]  You know what else is a win?
[6916.84 --> 6919.80]  We can apparently refurbish phone screens
[6919.80 --> 6920.36]  This is so cool
[6920.36 --> 6921.40]  With lasers
[6921.40 --> 6923.48]  With freaking laser beams
[6923.48 --> 6925.80]  With freaking laser beams attached to their heads
[6925.80 --> 6926.20]  Yeah
[6926.20 --> 6927.96]  Uh strange parts has a video
[6929.32 --> 6931.88]  And he broke one law of linus already
[6932.36 --> 6934.68]  He starts his video with so but otherwise
[6934.68 --> 6935.40]  Otherwise
[6935.40 --> 6935.96]  Otherwise
[6936.52 --> 6939.64]  This looks absolutely flippin amazing
[6940.92 --> 6942.04]  They are repairing
[6942.84 --> 6946.52]  OLED screens that have bad lines in them using a laser
[6946.52 --> 6949.72]  You guys I'm not going to show you much of this because I want you to go watch it
[6949.72 --> 6951.24]  Watch the video from scotty
[6951.48 --> 6953.32]  Hey, he's coming to ltx right?
[6953.32 --> 6953.56]  Yeah
[6953.56 --> 6954.20]  I think so
[6954.20 --> 6954.44]  Yeah
[6954.44 --> 6955.00]  Yeah
[6955.00 --> 6956.20]  Scotty's going to be at ltx
[6956.20 --> 6957.16]  And who's at the last one?
[6957.16 --> 6957.32]  Yeah
[6957.32 --> 6958.68]  So we want to make sure we uh
[6958.68 --> 6959.96]  I mean we would do this for anyone
[6959.96 --> 6961.24]  But we want to make sure we support him
[6961.24 --> 6963.16]  We're not just like playing his video for you
[6963.16 --> 6966.12]  Uh but basically they don't have to disassemble the device
[6966.12 --> 6968.04]  They don't even have to turn it off
[6968.92 --> 6971.88]  It can't fix glass or flex cables
[6971.88 --> 6973.96]  But it can eliminate lines on screens
[6973.96 --> 6977.40]  And fix issues with the middle oled layer
[6978.20 --> 6979.24]  Our discussion question is
[6979.24 --> 6981.00]  If this technique turns out to be economical
[6981.48 --> 6983.48]  Uh what would that mean for the refurbishment market?
[6983.48 --> 6985.72]  And I think the answer is fairly straightforward
[6985.72 --> 6988.04]  It would be freaking awesome
[6988.04 --> 6988.36]  Yeah
[6988.36 --> 6989.08]  Absolutely
[6990.44 --> 6991.72]  That seems to be like the goal
[6991.72 --> 6992.92]  They talked a lot in the video
[6992.92 --> 6994.12]  Which you should go watch
[6994.84 --> 6996.20]  About how there's you know
[6996.20 --> 6997.32]  Improvements coming
[6997.32 --> 6999.24]  They talk about what type of improvements and whatnot
[7000.60 --> 7001.08]  Um
[7001.08 --> 7001.80]  Activision
[7001.80 --> 7004.92]  Activision restores servers for retro call of duty games
[7004.92 --> 7007.48]  Activision has restored the multiplayer servers for its
[7007.48 --> 7009.72]  Xbox 360 era call of duty games
[7009.72 --> 7014.60]  Over 200 000 gamers played these decade-old COD titles over the past weekend
[7014.60 --> 7019.00]  Outnumbering the players for halo infinite and battle 2042 combined
[7019.00 --> 7020.44]  Probably quite easily
[7021.08 --> 7027.56]  By midweek five of the top 10 best-selling games on the xbox store were 360 era call of duty games
[7027.56 --> 7031.40]  With number one being 2012's black ops 2
[7031.40 --> 7037.48]  It appears that activision has neglected to enact fixes for long known exploits that
[7038.36 --> 7039.96]  That enable rampant hacking
[7040.36 --> 7048.92]  Fixes for these bugs were available in multiple popular community run servers that activision had shut down back in may as we reported on WAN show
[7049.96 --> 7052.68]  Which is kind of a freaking joke
[7052.68 --> 7057.00]  Our discussion question is well, there's one thing, but there's also some other things
[7057.00 --> 7060.92]  I mean, I think there's I think there's a lot to kind of break down here one is hey
[7061.48 --> 7065.56]  You guys need to actually not shut down older gaming experiences
[7066.20 --> 7071.96]  Two you don't get to just allow communities to do a bunch of work to keep your game alive
[7072.36 --> 7078.92]  And then capitalize on it while also throwing away the work that they did that made the game better while you were
[7079.24 --> 7083.72]  Completely well you had completely abandoned your stewardship of it. Yeah, and three
[7083.72 --> 7088.68]  Our discussion question that's actually written in here is I guess those weren't really discussions
[7088.68 --> 7092.20]  That was like you suck stat division discussions statements
[7092.36 --> 7097.56]  What does it mean that games that modern games are getting beat out by decades old titles in this way?
[7097.72 --> 7102.36]  It means that modern games are not actually fun dude
[7103.08 --> 7106.04]  You should play battle bit. Did you ever like battlefield? I?
[7107.16 --> 7112.92]  Never got into a battlefield game. Okay, so then maybe not but that was it is actually like I haven't had fun
[7113.40 --> 7120.76]  Actual genuine fun in battlefield since probably battlefield 4 and battlefield 4 felt like a step back from battlefield 3
[7120.84 --> 7122.84]  But I really liked battlefield 3
[7123.24 --> 7124.52]  um
[7124.52 --> 7132.20]  Battle bit is the first time that i've played a game in that format since then that i actually enjoyed and it's good
[7132.20 --> 7138.44]  It's fun the graphics are trash. It feels like they're basically roadblocks. Yeah, yeah, but like it doesn't
[7139.16 --> 7143.56]  Matter and I think i've talked about this on on wanshow before and it drives people nuts
[7144.12 --> 7150.68]  But now I have like really good proof what really matters is is the game freaking fun or not?
[7150.68 --> 7159.08]  Yeah, I don't care. I would have I I I the amount of my brain that gives an f that the graphics and battle bit are trash
[7159.08 --> 7163.00]  Is like near zero when i'm very much enjoying playing the game?
[7163.00 --> 7165.88]  I think for a single-player game i'd feel a little bit differently about it
[7165.88 --> 7172.44]  But for a competitive game i'd rather a really well-balanced game. That's not full of cheaters. Yeah, and then
[7173.56 --> 7175.56]  Like you know novel gameplay
[7176.20 --> 7181.72]  Mechanics is kind of here and then you've got like um, you know a positive community
[7182.28 --> 7189.16]  I can live without that, you know if the game is really fun and then like down here somewhere is is is graphics is visual fidelity, right?
[7189.16 --> 7192.60]  And single-player experiences. I would almost argue that uh
[7193.08 --> 7194.04]  graphics become
[7194.76 --> 7196.76]  More of a chance of being important
[7197.40 --> 7198.76]  But I don't think they always are
[7199.72 --> 7205.24]  I think there's plenty of single-player experiences that don't have that fantastic graphics, but because the game's great
[7205.40 --> 7211.72]  I don't really care, but I do also think that if graphics are amazing in a single-player experience that it can add a lot more to my
[7211.72 --> 7213.56]  Enjoyment than it can in a multiplayer
[7213.56 --> 7218.84]  Slapshot rebound has crap graphics, but it's just dumb fun. Yeah, so who cares?
[7219.40 --> 7223.96]  So who cares just run around and like we actually got like annoyed when the graphics got
[7224.52 --> 7229.00]  More in depth because there's one way that you can make sure your like heads invisible and we're like that's stupid
[7229.48 --> 7233.40]  Yeah, well, that's a cosmetics issue. I don't know if that's like a like a visual
[7234.04 --> 7235.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[7235.88 --> 7239.48]  But yeah, I did yeah someone said minecraft is the best-selling game of all time
[7240.04 --> 7241.16]  um, yeah
[7241.16 --> 7242.20]  Yeah
[7242.20 --> 7247.64]  Though minecraft also can look really good. You can get really insane graphics packs for it, but by default
[7248.20 --> 7249.24]  It doesn't
[7249.24 --> 7254.52]  Old school runescape gang represent people still play old school runescape like people play all these retro games
[7255.24 --> 7258.60]  Man like graphics can make something that's already amazing
[7259.32 --> 7260.68]  Like amazing plus
[7261.96 --> 7263.96]  But it doesn't make something amazing
[7264.76 --> 7269.48]  Like I I don't know I can't remember a single game that I was like yeah, I loved that game
[7269.48 --> 7271.80]  Because the graphics were so great
[7273.40 --> 7274.76]  I don't think that's ever happened
[7275.64 --> 7279.56]  I might love a game and be like yeah, and I really like how great the graphics are
[7280.12 --> 7282.92]  But like I love the game because of certain gameplay features
[7283.80 --> 7289.48]  I wouldn't say graphics, but I could say I could love a game just based on a visual style
[7290.44 --> 7291.64]  um
[7291.64 --> 7295.56]  Like even though I ended up not finishing it because there were gameplay issues
[7295.96 --> 7297.72]  uh, fantasia is beautiful
[7298.76 --> 7303.96]  And I I just liked exploring the environments one thing that I really like about assassin's creed odyssey
[7303.96 --> 7311.08]  Is I think the the setting of being in greece and the graphical fidelity that they had at this point in time the development process being in greece
[7311.08 --> 7317.32]  Is it's just a very beautiful landscape to be in and like there have been times when i've just goofed around you know playing a game like far cry
[7317.32 --> 7317.80]  I liked the game
[7317.80 --> 7322.68]  You know, which at the time was groundbreaking in terms of what it looked like and just
[7323.48 --> 7328.28]  Looking at the water and the you know the landscapes and I feel like we're kind of past that now though
[7328.28 --> 7331.64]  Trying to think of something more recent then
[7336.68 --> 7343.56]  Because that that was totally a thing at one point, but I feel like it's kind of past it's definitely it was definitely part of breath of the wild for me even though
[7344.68 --> 7349.32]  The graphics are not amazing, but the art the art style was beautiful
[7350.20 --> 7352.20]  um
[7353.64 --> 7355.88]  I just I feel like the importance of graph like
[7356.52 --> 7361.08]  I've heard a lot of conversation about like oh making games these days is so hard because
[7361.80 --> 7362.28]  uh
[7362.28 --> 7366.04]  And then a huge amount of reasons, but a lot of them being graphics
[7366.60 --> 7370.84]  And how expensive it is to have extremely fantastic graphics and it's like well
[7371.40 --> 7373.16]  It's gonna get cheap don't
[7373.88 --> 7379.48]  Yes, it's gonna get really cheap and valve's gonna eventually come up with a policy that somehow
[7379.48 --> 7388.68]  allows them to allow ai-generated assets in games without exposing themselves to legal liability and they're not going to care after that and then
[7390.12 --> 7392.52]  Man, we are gonna get some amazing
[7393.80 --> 7398.12]  amazing visual fidelity in games with shockingly low budgets
[7398.60 --> 7403.88]  uh that combined with over the next let's say let's say i'm gonna give a five-year timeline for this
[7403.88 --> 7406.36]  I think that's pretty generous we're gonna see
[7407.32 --> 7411.56]  Procedurally or no not procedurally, but we're gonna see artificially generated assets
[7411.88 --> 7415.40]  We're gonna see artificially generated textures. We're gonna see
[7416.04 --> 7416.52]  um
[7416.52 --> 7423.56]  Like like worlds and environments that are generated, but then tweaked and then we're gonna see I hope if all goes
[7424.04 --> 7425.72]  according to what I think would be
[7425.72 --> 7436.20]  The the ideal scenario for single a and double a developers to compete with the the the visual fidelity fests that that have become triple a
[7436.20 --> 7439.96]  You know multi hundred million dollar budget games these days
[7440.52 --> 7444.52]  um, I think we're gonna see I hope we're going to see a refocusing on
[7445.40 --> 7451.16]  Writing and storytelling who knows maybe the gaming industry would be a great place for all those wga
[7451.16 --> 7454.28]  Yeah, folks to go just I mean
[7455.16 --> 7460.60]  Throwing it out there just to kind of you know wild idea if if there was like a scrappy
[7461.00 --> 7465.48]  Developer that was looking to do an incredibly incredible story driven game
[7466.12 --> 7468.12]  um
[7468.12 --> 7469.88]  I i'd love to see more focus on that
[7469.88 --> 7475.08]  So that's the one part of this that i'm saying I would like to see everything else is more of just what I think is going to happen
[7475.80 --> 7479.40]  um, and then that combined with what will become the
[7480.36 --> 7485.24]  Ubiquity of ray tracing capable graphics hardware in that time
[7485.24 --> 7490.36]  That's why i'm giving it a five-year timeline because I think a lot of what i'm talking about could be happening today take a while
[7491.24 --> 7492.52]  but
[7492.52 --> 7497.32]  You're going to need like if you're going to try and and build something with just like
[7498.60 --> 7499.48]  um
[7499.48 --> 7502.04]  You know random generated assets
[7502.04 --> 7505.32]  You're not going to be able to implement a lot of the tricks
[7505.32 --> 7509.96]  That developers have had to use to create a really
[7510.52 --> 7512.36]  um immersive
[7512.36 --> 7512.92]  um
[7512.92 --> 7520.76]  Environment right whereas with ray traced lighting well all of a sudden all you have to do is say okay
[7520.76 --> 7521.72]  I need
[7521.72 --> 7525.08]  Lanterns and i'm going to put them here here here these are my light sources
[7525.08 --> 7528.84]  I mean looking at what they did with uh was it um
[7529.40 --> 7534.28]  Oblivion I think it was with rtx remix. Oh man, there's so many things I want to address from chat right now
[7534.28 --> 7535.24]  So cool
[7535.24 --> 7538.20]  Uh, I I there's been a few if I remember correctly
[7538.20 --> 7543.32]  There's a black flag update and a unity update and I think it was also oblivion
[7543.48 --> 7546.12]  They're all getting like rtx remix updates
[7546.12 --> 7550.84]  Well, I don't think oblivion was actually getting one. It was just a demo that nvidia did. Uh, okay
[7551.88 --> 7555.08]  Morrowind really was it morrowind. I don't think so
[7556.68 --> 7558.04]  No, it was oblivion. Here we go
[7558.60 --> 7562.04]  Or wait, uh, oh, no, it is. Yeah. Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, it's morrowind here really
[7562.04 --> 7564.04]  Oh, but it didn't actually get it
[7564.52 --> 7565.16]  No, no, no
[7566.36 --> 7567.00]  Yep
[7567.00 --> 7569.80]  Stills look still looks no no no it's not on yet
[7570.28 --> 7576.12]  So there this is the capture tool and then they go through and show the ai texture tools
[7577.00 --> 7580.60]  Oh, I remember this yeah, but they didn't give it to us. Give it to me
[7580.60 --> 7583.56]  Yep, and then they do lighting
[7585.00 --> 7589.32]  And then uh, man, and then it it starts to look really cool
[7589.32 --> 7590.92]  Let me have it
[7590.92 --> 7595.96]  Yeah, custom assets. Um, yeah, this is this is pretty wild. This is this is worth watching
[7596.92 --> 7601.16]  Oh, let's see if it yeah, here we go rtx remix. Yeah, like that's wild. That is
[7601.88 --> 7607.96]  freaking morrowind sort of xbox original game like really like a rig xbox original
[7607.96 --> 7615.32]  Yeah, so i'm imagining this future where you'll have you know single a or even indie developers
[7616.04 --> 7619.96]  That are building games that have this kind of graphical fidelity because they just
[7621.48 --> 7622.92]  For better or for worse
[7624.12 --> 7626.12]  Are able to generate assets
[7627.40 --> 7635.40]  Based on the you know library of work that came before them whether legitimately built on or not
[7635.40 --> 7640.04]  And if valve doesn't find a way to make this work
[7641.00 --> 7645.96]  Another marketplace will come and we'll eat their lunch. I think this is disruptive enough that if there's a game
[7646.52 --> 7647.56]  that
[7647.56 --> 7652.44]  Is compelling enough people will go to some other storefront and they'll buy it. I mean look at um, okay
[7652.44 --> 7657.00]  Escape from tarkov would be a great example of this before they totally screwed it up, right?
[7657.56 --> 7660.76]  People went and they downloaded their launcher. There's so
[7661.64 --> 7663.64]  Oh, no, are there updates?
[7663.96 --> 7672.60]  Sort of not sort of but not really there's a they have a leaderboard out for like, you know, like best kd most profit per run different things like that
[7673.16 --> 7673.72]  and
[7673.72 --> 7679.32]  uh, they they launched it and there's all these names on it and stuff and you see some ratios and some stats there and you're like wow
[7679.32 --> 7680.76]  That looks really fishy
[7680.76 --> 7684.92]  Uh users brought up there the last time they did a leaderboard because they've done this before
[7684.92 --> 7690.20]  Uh, and they had it's probably on the escape from tarkov subreddit, but i'd have to dig it up
[7690.84 --> 7696.92]  But it showed all the people that had been banned off of the leaderboard and out of the top 100. There's like five left
[7698.44 --> 7700.92]  I want to see it. I want to see if I can find it. Um
[7702.44 --> 7704.44]  That is ridiculous
[7706.52 --> 7707.80]  I suspect it's gonna be
[7709.08 --> 7711.08]  too hard to dig up now
[7711.80 --> 7714.44]  um
[7715.56 --> 7717.56]  I can do a quick topic while you look for that
[7717.56 --> 7724.12]  Yeah, well one sec. I want to address some some full-playing comments really quick one person not angry scotsman said crisis was only really well known because
[7724.60 --> 7726.60]  of the graphics memes
[7727.40 --> 7727.48]  um
[7727.48 --> 7729.48]  crisis was actually a very fun game
[7730.04 --> 7734.92]  To be honest, I think it was a great game and it also had just mind-bogglingly
[7735.48 --> 7739.40]  Uh crazy graphics and far cry was really fun too far cry is a really good game
[7739.40 --> 7745.56]  I actually replayed it not that long ago and really enjoyed it and I didn't realize it until quite late in the game
[7745.56 --> 7751.96]  But part of the reason I was enjoying it at my current skill level compared to when I was 17 or 18 or whatever when it came out
[7752.44 --> 7753.32]  um
[7753.32 --> 7756.84]  Is that the ai is bound to your frame rate?
[7757.16 --> 7760.76]  So because I was playing it at such a higher frame rate the enemies were really hard
[7761.00 --> 7763.00]  I was like, yeah, this is like a hard game
[7763.00 --> 7765.72]  Like I remember this game being hard, but like why is it still hard?
[7765.72 --> 7766.92]  I'm pretty sure i'm better at this than
[7766.92 --> 7768.92]  That's when I was a kid
[7769.80 --> 7772.68]  And then the other comment, um that that
[7773.64 --> 7777.16]  made me want to jump, uh was avon fox said 100 hours
[7777.80 --> 7782.44]  gameplay versus two hours movie watch games are way better value for the cost
[7782.92 --> 7783.96]  uh to make
[7785.32 --> 7791.88]  And this is this is a very slippery slope argument in my opinion because I don't think we're there right now
[7791.88 --> 7796.52]  But there was a point in time in gaming where games were essentially sold off of their
[7797.08 --> 7800.84]  200 hour campaign off of their game time and having
[7801.40 --> 7803.40]  200 hours of garbage
[7803.40 --> 7807.96]  Is significantly worse than having two hours of just raw quality
[7808.36 --> 7811.80]  Um, you should value your own time that is important
[7811.88 --> 7815.40]  One of my favorite shooters of all time potentially my favorite shooter single player
[7815.72 --> 7818.68]  Uh experience of all time is titanfall 2. It's like
[7819.40 --> 7820.84]  six hours
[7820.84 --> 7827.72]  Six to eight hours, but it's just quality. They make sure that if they introduce a new mechanic before you're tired of it. It's gone
[7829.32 --> 7831.32]  What is that?
[7831.32 --> 7833.32]  That noise is the
[7833.64 --> 7837.48]  Overflow pump for the air conditioner. Okay, so we're everything's okay
[7837.64 --> 7841.88]  And you even see game developers tacitly acknowledging this right like um
[7843.40 --> 7850.68]  Square, Square Enix for example, they did remasters of or like pixel remasters of some of their older games and they include quality of life
[7850.68 --> 7851.32]  features like
[7851.32 --> 7853.16]  Like turning off random encounters
[7853.80 --> 7858.68]  I remember as a kid feeling like some of those environments were enormous
[7859.24 --> 7860.76]  You know the floating continent
[7861.32 --> 7861.88]  felt like
[7862.68 --> 7864.12]  Continental sized
[7864.68 --> 7867.40]  Uh, not because there was a ton of room on a snes cartridge
[7867.64 --> 7874.04]  But because every time you took three steps you were fighting some stupid random encounter that was capable of wiping you out
[7874.04 --> 7877.56]  Because you were 10 and it was hard, right?
[7877.80 --> 7878.04]  Um
[7879.16 --> 7882.12]  So these games come back and it's like yeah, you can just like do
[7882.12 --> 7886.28]  9999 damage anytime you want because we know the stuff is actually kind of boring
[7886.28 --> 7889.08]  And you can just explore the world like I I that would be a much
[7889.72 --> 7894.52]  If I if I was to give that game to my kids final fantasy 6 is the one that I I enjoyed the most
[7894.52 --> 7898.44]  Personally if I was to give that game to my kids, I would absolutely give them the pixel remaster
[7899.48 --> 7900.52]  they don't need to
[7901.48 --> 7906.36]  Fight that boss battle nine times to have the you know the fun that I did and and to
[7906.92 --> 7908.52]  To experience the story that I did
[7908.52 --> 7913.08]  So, uh, i'm gonna share my screen really quick. I found it. Um
[7914.92 --> 7919.64]  So I don't know 100 what exp rating means in this in this
[7920.92 --> 7925.08]  Frame but these are the top 100 tarkov players for exp rating
[7925.72 --> 7927.24]  If their name is a dash
[7928.04 --> 7932.44]  See how you can see this name right here yikes if the name is a dash they're banned
[7933.96 --> 7936.84]  Uh, you can't see behind our frame here right now
[7936.84 --> 7944.36]  Um, but it's all dashes for for that section of the leaderboard we go here. There's oh, there's there's three names
[7944.68 --> 7950.76]  That's good. All of the rest of them are dashes. We go here. There's there's a few more. There's five six names
[7950.76 --> 7952.76]  All the rest of our dashes
[7954.04 --> 7956.04]  For all the rest are dashes
[7956.84 --> 7958.60]  It's just like
[7958.60 --> 7966.12]  Man now that was the old leaderboards, uh, but if you take a gander at the new leaderboards, it feels like it might be going in the same direction
[7966.84 --> 7968.52]  Uh, because there's a few things on there that are like
[7969.08 --> 7971.24]  Hmm, this person's like
[7972.28 --> 7975.32]  The the ratios on some things are just very very odd
[7975.64 --> 7977.64]  Um, and either
[7977.64 --> 7984.84]  The escape from tarkov client is like calculating things incorrectly or things are not exactly above board so
[7986.12 --> 7989.32]  Elemental exposure there is a chrono trigger sequel. It's called chrono cross
[7989.32 --> 7991.32]  D boss
[7993.08 --> 7996.12]  D boss my final fantasy six growing up was mario rpg
[7997.00 --> 7999.64]  Yeah, I saw the oh my god. Have you seen the remake?
[8000.52 --> 8004.12]  It looks no. Yeah, uh, legend of the seven stars remake
[8006.68 --> 8008.68]  Nintendo's gonna get my money again
[8009.24 --> 8011.72]  got him it appears to be
[8012.76 --> 8014.52]  a super
[8014.52 --> 8016.12]  One month ago
[8016.12 --> 8018.60]  It it it appears to be a super
[8018.60 --> 8020.76]  uh, true to the original
[8021.40 --> 8022.20]  Remake
[8022.20 --> 8025.48]  Uh, which is fine because the game was already perfect
[8025.48 --> 8030.04]  Wait for it
[8031.32 --> 8039.08]  So that was the original snes graphics and so they've done a bunch of stuff here that may or may not be designed to mislead us
[8039.72 --> 8041.24]  uh, but essentially it
[8042.12 --> 8044.12]  from what they've shown
[8044.12 --> 8046.60]  Look even the way that he moves around in the environment
[8047.40 --> 8054.20]  How it's um, I forget what this view is called isometric or whatever. Yeah, like you've got your like the grid based movement. Yeah, yeah
[8054.20 --> 8056.60]  Yeah, is true to the original game
[8057.64 --> 8058.04]  Um
[8059.32 --> 8065.88]  This looks great. I would play this. Yeah, have you ever played legend of the seven stars? Technically I own it, but I have not played it
[8066.12 --> 8068.36]  It's really good. Yeah, it's really good. You should play it
[8069.00 --> 8073.72]  Um, and like it's one of those games where honestly other than a couple of modern gaming
[8074.68 --> 8075.72]  Um
[8075.72 --> 8080.04]  Comforts, I just don't really see what they would need to change about it. It's not very challenging
[8080.84 --> 8086.28]  Um, it's more just like as an adult you just you just play through it as a kid. It was hard, but yeah
[8086.28 --> 8087.96]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so good
[8089.16 --> 8090.84]  so good
[8090.84 --> 8092.84]  Um
[8092.84 --> 8096.36]  But there's a couple more topics that we have to do before we do ran after dark because we did tease them
[8096.60 --> 8105.08]  Meta has cancelled the quest pro and reportedly stopped or the reportedly cancelled the quest pro and reportedly stopped all development on the quest pro 2
[8105.72 --> 8110.68]  Their plan is to continue to build quest pro headsets only as long as current stock lasts
[8111.32 --> 8119.08]  When they launched it in october of 2022 it was criticized for its awkward fit along the forehead its cheap feel and its underwhelming software platform
[8119.56 --> 8125.40]  Apparently by january meta had already told its suppliers that no further components for the quest pro would be needed
[8125.80 --> 8129.88]  Even before dropping the price from fifteen hundred to a thousand dollars in march
[8129.88 --> 8135.40]  Our discussion question is what's behind the lack of enthusiasm for meta's more expensive vr headsets?
[8136.04 --> 8143.72]  And um, I think the answer is that they just didn't offer a compelling value add over meta's entry-level headsets
[8143.72 --> 8146.04]  I also think they've just been going in the wrong direction
[8146.76 --> 8148.76]  Really? Um, what would be better?
[8149.40 --> 8151.24]  I think apple's approach is going to be better
[8151.96 --> 8157.00]  Um, I think apple didn't go quite full bore enough for what I would personally like to see
[8157.00 --> 8162.76]  Uh, but I feel like they are prepping everybody for it adequately by having that attached battery
[8163.40 --> 8169.40]  Um, but stacking all of your battery and your compute hanging off the front of your face is just like
[8170.20 --> 8175.24]  Actually stupid. Why are we still doing this like with the amount of money that you're investing that in this?
[8175.96 --> 8178.12]  How did you not know this was dumb like?
[8179.88 --> 8185.40]  Come on and I I am very appreciative of apple which is a statement that I feel like I don't say all that often
[8185.40 --> 8187.40]  Um, but for
[8188.12 --> 8192.76]  Having this tether which is not going to be very annoying because it's tether that is contained on you. Yep
[8193.08 --> 8194.04]  um, and
[8194.60 --> 8198.36]  Moving that battery weight off of the device. That's a huge
[8199.16 --> 8202.28]  Benefit. Yeah, and eventually if we can take compute off as well
[8203.32 --> 8210.04]  Fantastic, that's one of the reasons I still use my index. Yeah, because most of the new headsets that have come have taken advantage
[8210.04 --> 8217.40]  Of the lightning of the displays and the housings and the uh lenses
[8218.68 --> 8222.44]  And then gone. Yeah, now we can put more other stuff
[8223.16 --> 8226.04]  Still in front of your face. I haven't seen a
[8226.92 --> 8231.32]  Genuinely compelling enough device to move to from the index this whole time
[8232.04 --> 8234.76]  And like that that's a problem. That's a mistake
[8234.76 --> 8239.16]  I think they're just absolutely going in the wrong direction big screen beyond has a lot of potential
[8239.72 --> 8242.84]  Um, my problem with it is that I can't get it working
[8243.64 --> 8245.24]  um, I sent them
[8246.44 --> 8251.16]  I think I sent them now that I think about it. I haven't heard back in a while which is
[8251.72 --> 8254.04]  Pretty unusual for something like this. Um
[8254.92 --> 8257.48]  Let me just see if I actually ever pressed send on this
[8257.48 --> 8259.48]  Doop-doop-doop-doop-doop
[8260.60 --> 8261.48]  Oh
[8261.48 --> 8264.52]  Oh, no, I never I never sent the email
[8265.56 --> 8271.64]  Oh crap, you know what I think it was is normally uh, or it used to be when you uploaded a youtube video
[8273.00 --> 8273.32]  um
[8274.28 --> 8277.96]  You could get the link to it before it was done processing
[8279.88 --> 8283.72]  But um, oh wait, this has 33 views though
[8284.52 --> 8286.44]  Did I did I not send? Uh, okay
[8287.48 --> 8290.68]  Don't you link it internally? Uh, I don't think so
[8294.36 --> 8295.96]  Okay, well I will send that to them
[8297.48 --> 8301.24]  Shoot so i'm the one who wait the email today. How was this not uh?
[8302.44 --> 8306.76]  Um, yeah ever since they cut ties with with palmer lucky. I
[8307.48 --> 8312.04]  Oh, wait, I don't think they've really been going in the right direction. Oh shoot. No, they replied to me. What the heck?
[8312.04 --> 8313.24]  Why are there?
[8313.24 --> 8315.32]  Their emails are getting automatically marked red
[8315.32 --> 8322.04]  Uh, okay. Oh, this is awkward shoot. I just sent them the same video again ignore last email
[8322.36 --> 8324.36]  I will try tonight
[8325.32 --> 8326.44]  Shoot
[8326.44 --> 8328.44]  Um, I will mark that on red
[8329.00 --> 8333.64]  Cool. Anywho, uh, yeah, I just can't get it working. So I sent them this video of
[8334.44 --> 8336.76]  Doing everything that they told me to do
[8337.24 --> 8344.92]  Supposedly it's supposed to just work and then the first time the first headset I had it worked other than that whenever I had OBS active
[8345.56 --> 8346.52]  The mic
[8347.16 --> 8349.16]  Wouldn't work coming out of the headset and I was like well
[8349.16 --> 8353.08]  This doesn't work because I wanted to stream because it was still under embargo for reviews
[8353.24 --> 8355.96]  But you were allowed to stream with it. I'm like how on earth am I supposed to stream with it?
[8355.96 --> 8357.96]  They're like we've never seen that bug before no idea
[8357.96 --> 8361.56]  They sent me another one that's apparently better in some other ways as well
[8361.96 --> 8366.60]  And they were like, okay, try this one and then it just didn't work at all
[8367.00 --> 8369.00]  And so I sent them um
[8369.08 --> 8371.08]  This video that I recorded
[8371.24 --> 8373.24]  Where i'm basically like yep
[8374.20 --> 8376.20]  Here's my drivers
[8376.20 --> 8380.12]  Here's um, the latest version of steam vr
[8380.60 --> 8386.36]  Here's the headset definitely plugged in correctly. Here's me doing absolutely everything you told me to do
[8386.36 --> 8388.04]  And it doesn't work at all
[8388.04 --> 8394.44]  Um, so based on their email, it might be something to do with some kind of bluetooth wake something something by
[8396.84 --> 8399.56]  Lighthouse trackers v2 something so hopefully it's
[8400.12 --> 8407.24]  Hopefully it's fixed and i'm it's pretty promising. I have some concerns. I have a bunch of notes on it already even though I haven't managed to actually
[8407.80 --> 8409.00]  um
[8409.00 --> 8412.28]  Like a game for an extended period of time with it
[8412.28 --> 8416.44]  Uh, like the the rubber I feel like they need something a bit more breathable
[8416.52 --> 8421.40]  They need at least a breathable option especially because quite a few of the vr experiences that people
[8422.20 --> 8423.32]  are
[8423.32 --> 8427.16]  As far as I can tell right now really engaging in are like fitness ones
[8427.16 --> 8432.28]  Especially if you like if you have a reason to spend a bunch of money on a super lightweight headset
[8433.80 --> 8436.04]  There's a good chance it's because you're moving around. Yeah
[8436.44 --> 8436.92]  um
[8436.92 --> 8444.04]  Because if you can if you can attach work or health to something the amount that people are willing to spend on it just cranks
[8444.28 --> 8447.88]  If you're like oh this could this can oh you're having a hard time getting out of the house
[8447.88 --> 8453.08]  But you want to be physically active, but you find a lot of the at home like calisthenics workout stuff really boring
[8453.32 --> 8457.16]  Well, you could like do vr boxing or or beat saber or whatever
[8457.48 --> 8460.92]  Okay, now this is going to help me shed weight or do whatever else now
[8460.92 --> 8465.32]  I will spend a bunch on this product if it's just for gaming or whatever else depends on the person
[8465.32 --> 8470.12]  But I think yeah, your higher likeliness if you can attach something else to it corsair bought drop
[8471.16 --> 8472.76]  Yeah, um
[8472.84 --> 8476.12]  Corsair announced they have bought audio and mechanical keyboard company drop
[8476.44 --> 8482.60]  They apparently don't plan to make any changes before assessing the non keyboard aspects of drops business
[8482.68 --> 8484.68]  I have no idea what that even means
[8484.68 --> 8491.64]  Uh, they say drop will remain a separate brand and will continue to handle all existing warranties purchases and customer support requests
[8492.36 --> 8500.68]  They always companies always say that when they acquire other companies that way for probably one to three years and then it will change and then
[8502.52 --> 8506.04]  Um, the discussion question here is what's the best way to handle acquiring an established brand?
[8506.52 --> 8509.64]  I gotta be honest with you. I don't know. We've had a lot of people
[8510.36 --> 8512.52]  Even like members of the audience for example
[8513.32 --> 8516.44]  Uh suggesting that we buy smaller tech channels
[8516.92 --> 8520.68]  To to to build the empire and i'm kind of sitting here going why?
[8522.20 --> 8523.64]  What would that actually do?
[8524.84 --> 8528.12]  If they were doing great then wouldn't they just continue doing great?
[8528.44 --> 8530.84]  And if they weren't doing great then why do I want them?
[8530.84 --> 8533.80]  mythical has seen some actual success with that um
[8534.28 --> 8534.84]  fair enough
[8535.96 --> 8539.48]  I I understand and agree with your argument
[8539.96 --> 8542.04]  To be honest, but I think
[8542.68 --> 8547.24]  There can be exceptions to the general rule and I think mythical has been hitting pretty well there
[8547.24 --> 8548.28]  um
[8550.12 --> 8557.08]  Yeah, yeah, like oh man, this is a perfect example from moddy underscore ch in float plane chat like logitech and blue mics
[8557.96 --> 8563.88]  They've gotten to the point now where they aren't even continuing with the blue branding. Yeah, that's that was a weird move
[8563.88 --> 8566.92]  That's actually kind of stupid. Yeah, I agree
[8567.88 --> 8570.28]  Like if you're buying something that's working
[8571.08 --> 8572.84]  Why unworking it?
[8574.12 --> 8575.56]  Unless it's a competitor, I guess
[8576.60 --> 8578.92]  But then just make it seem like you're competing
[8578.92 --> 8582.68]  They could just be buying the ip like i'm sure blue owned a bunch of patents and stuff
[8582.68 --> 8586.04]  So that's probably true. It's not that I don't understand it. I just mean
[8586.04 --> 8589.48]  But you could also just keep selling blue mics
[8590.20 --> 8593.00]  And have a distinct identity for that brand
[8594.04 --> 8597.08]  All the people working on that were literally already working there
[8597.64 --> 8600.12]  And it was working or why would you or why did you buy them?
[8600.12 --> 8606.20]  So someone in float plane chat said yeah, uh, key man in float plane chat said mythical bought smosh and just sold it back
[8606.60 --> 8609.08]  That might sound like it was a failure
[8609.72 --> 8611.08]  I think that's extremely
[8611.96 --> 8618.28]  Not true though. I haven't talked to anyone there about the specifics of all of that, but to me it really seems
[8618.84 --> 8626.36]  Uh, like mythical stepped into kind of save smosh. Yeah, that was the vibe I got and then when they were ready to take it back over
[8626.92 --> 8629.64]  They were highly accommodating of letting them take it back over
[8629.64 --> 8631.48]  It was like very bro move
[8631.80 --> 8636.44]  Um, and I really respect what was done there. I don't think that was like a failed business decision
[8637.00 --> 8639.80]  I don't think you can look at them selling it back as a failure
[8640.20 --> 8645.64]  In any other way in my opinion, I would look at them selling it back as like a major success. I think that was
[8646.28 --> 8651.40]  Very very cool and good of them. The whole smosh story is is very interesting. Um
[8651.40 --> 8658.28]  Um, um, yeah, I don't know but they and they also invest in in other
[8659.24 --> 8661.32]  channels as well. It's not just smosh so
[8662.84 --> 8666.76]  Yeah, and in other news isus has taken on the nook
[8667.96 --> 8672.20]  So we can still have nook pcs. They will just be from asus rather than intel, which
[8673.32 --> 8679.96]  Is great if you want those and you didn't want to buy them from any of the other handful of manufacturers that also make nook likes
[8680.68 --> 8684.28]  Very cool. Don't you love that term? Nook likes not the likes. It's pretty good. I
[8684.92 --> 8688.52]  Didn't I didn't come up with that. I think it might have been james or something someone else back in the day
[8689.24 --> 8691.40]  Millions of military emails
[8691.40 --> 8694.20]  Yeah, that's by typo and we didn't tease it
[8695.00 --> 8699.56]  Huh? All right fine. You can do it if you want I was going to do when after dark. Oh, okay. I think this is hilarious
[8699.72 --> 8700.92]  I'll try to go through it pretty quick
[8700.92 --> 8707.16]  Millions of us military emails have been leaked over the last decade due to a common typo confusing the us military's
[8708.04 --> 8714.92]  special top level domain dot mil for dot ml the top level country domain of molly
[8716.52 --> 8722.12]  I don't even bother go through the rest of this. I just think that is very funny. Uh, there's a feature in
[8722.84 --> 8728.44]  In Gmail Google Workspace that warns you if you're emailing someone that's outside of your
[8729.24 --> 8736.84]  Workspace, so maybe they need something like that. Maybe that'll stop them from sending millions of emails to the wrong place
[8738.84 --> 8740.84]  Amazing
[8740.84 --> 8742.84]  And I think that's it
[8743.24 --> 8746.52]  Time for WAN show after dark. Let's go after dark time
[8747.32 --> 8752.68]  You know, you can't say same bad time same bad channel this week. Why not because it's not oh
[8754.76 --> 8760.68]  Different bad time same thing. That's right. WAN show is going to be during ltx next week. So it's going to be
[8762.04 --> 8763.48]  Later
[8763.48 --> 8765.88]  Earlier earlier it will be on time
[8766.60 --> 8774.28]  But the next day. Oh, it's on saturday. That's right. Oh, no friday WAN show. Yeah, that doesn't count as the streak ending
[8774.28 --> 8776.52]  I agree. I was wondering about that
[8777.48 --> 8782.60]  It's like do we all fail together? Are we going down in this ship as one or are we just counting it? Not a failure?
[8783.16 --> 8786.92]  I like counting it as not a failure. No, because WAN shows basically friday saturday now anyway
[8788.44 --> 8792.44]  Because of how often it bleeds into the next day. Yeah, this one's just really late
[8793.16 --> 8800.04]  Yeah, yeah, it's just extremely really late. Yeah, you were busy doing and dealing with ltx and so you couldn't make it on time
[8800.04 --> 8805.40]  I mean that is sort of accurate right? Yep 100% like yeah, yeah, exactly
[8806.04 --> 8808.12]  All right hit us dan. All right, here we go
[8808.92 --> 8814.12]  First up, I can't resist a good plushie. Luke if you are ever in denver
[8814.36 --> 8818.68]  I would love to give you a tour of the united launch alliance testing lab
[8818.92 --> 8822.44]  Linus and dan can come too, but I know luke loves space stuff
[8822.44 --> 8826.68]  Uh, so I curated this because I needed to tell them uh to to email
[8827.32 --> 8831.16]  Because I will go. Um, I will be in denver for that reason
[8831.88 --> 8836.76]  I will absolutely attend this sounds amazing and I appreciate you reaching out
[8837.32 --> 8840.20]  Hit up support at flowpoint.com. I'll get I'll get shamelessly
[8841.48 --> 8843.48]  Shamelessly leveraging so good
[8843.72 --> 8846.28]  So good with absolute look how little shame he has
[8846.76 --> 8851.88]  Literally none. I told linus last friday was a friday. I don't remember it was last week sometime
[8852.76 --> 8857.40]  That I am like my future of travel. I am 100% planning on it just being
[8858.04 --> 8865.72]  I'm just gonna like find cool people in the community that can get me access to really cool things and just go do that because wow
[8866.44 --> 8873.16]  Fantastic so good. Yeah negative shame about this. Yeah, I think that's I think that's accurate. So excited. Look at his face
[8873.48 --> 8877.72]  Beaming. Oh, I saw that in the in the merch messages dashboard. I was like, yeah
[8877.72 --> 8883.64]  Yes, that's amazing. I think there's actually a couple of those so you might have another one that you haven't seen yet sick
[8884.36 --> 8888.68]  Um, okay up next a high lld any update on the magnetic cable management gear
[8889.00 --> 8894.36]  I'm hoping you also do some sort of adhesive backed magnetic pad for people with wood desks
[8895.08 --> 8897.88]  Um, the update is that right now
[8898.52 --> 8903.96]  I'm speaking we were talking about uh labor action earlier on in the show and the port of vancouver is
[8904.60 --> 8908.52]  It's been will they won't they will they won't they will they won't they for the last few days
[8908.52 --> 8912.12]  But the last time I looked which was well before the show started today
[8912.84 --> 8916.28]  um, they were looking at um walking off the job again
[8917.24 --> 8923.80]  And from what i've heard every day that they are on strike is going to cause multiple days
[8924.36 --> 8927.24]  Of delays because of the buildup of shipments
[8927.24 --> 8932.68]  So we are not going to be getting any shipments of anything until all of that gets resolved
[8933.80 --> 8934.60]  however
[8934.60 --> 8937.88]  my understanding is that our final production is
[8938.92 --> 8945.72]  Basically ready to ship or has shipped already or something so that should be launching sometime in the near future
[8946.12 --> 8950.92]  And yes, it will include adhesive backed metal plates that
[8950.92 --> 8959.16]  Um, have holes in them so the idea is that you basically put the backing thing or you put the metal plate onto the magnet
[8959.48 --> 8961.56]  Stick it exactly where you want it to go
[8961.56 --> 8965.32]  The adhesive holds it in place while you slide the magnet off if you pull it off
[8965.32 --> 8967.64]  They're so strong it might pull the adhesive backing off
[8967.96 --> 8970.36]  Then you screw it in and then it is permanently installed
[8970.84 --> 8971.24]  um
[8972.12 --> 8976.60]  Really excited about that product, but unfortunately, I don't have an exact timeline to share it this time
[8976.60 --> 8981.88]  Any new floatplane features that are coming up in the pipeline that you're excited about?
[8981.88 --> 8986.44]  Oh, yeah, the new player check out the new player it's on the beta site you can go to beta.floatplane.com
[8986.44 --> 8992.04]  Um, and and you'll be able to see the new player right now the live version of it has a
[8993.48 --> 8998.60]  Dare I even say it the live version of it has a dark mode chat that you can enable if you want
[8999.08 --> 9004.28]  So that if you go into the the like theater view full screen player mode
[9004.28 --> 9009.24]  And you're watching something like wanshow. It doesn't have this glowing white bar on the side
[9009.80 --> 9011.80]  Um, so that's a thing
[9011.80 --> 9016.12]  Uh, and and there's other cool new features with the player. Uh, I
[9016.68 --> 9023.16]  Full transparency jaden was showing me all the work that he did on the player and I was just like smile and nodding while i'm thinking like wow
[9023.16 --> 9028.44]  This this really looks like how it's always looked and then I asked him because I was like man
[9028.44 --> 9029.80]  I really can't tell what's different
[9029.80 --> 9034.44]  I asked him to load up a version of the live site so I could see them side by side and I was like, whoa
[9035.00 --> 9040.84]  Okay, it's very different. It just like it just feels like it kind of was always this way
[9040.84 --> 9043.64]  Like it's it's not drastic in the way that you're gonna
[9044.28 --> 9047.24]  Lurch because it's so crazily different or anything
[9047.48 --> 9051.64]  Uh, but it is very noticeably different if you put them side by side and it's definitely an upgrade
[9051.64 --> 9056.12]  So you can check that out and that's the main thing that's coming. There's lots of features in the pipeline
[9056.12 --> 9063.08]  Um, but uh, that's the only one i'm gonna tell you guys about now the the beta site is how you're gonna be able to see
[9063.08 --> 9069.40]  What's coming in the future generally moving forward? Uh, we do plan on uh continuing to use that. So
[9070.28 --> 9071.96]  Yeah
[9071.96 --> 9076.20]  All right, let's see here. How did last week's international shipping shakeout?
[9077.72 --> 9079.72]  Good question
[9079.72 --> 9081.72]  Yeah, very good question
[9083.16 --> 9083.72]  I don't know
[9086.12 --> 9088.12]  He hasn't had the heart to check
[9088.76 --> 9090.12]  Yeah, nobody told me um
[9091.24 --> 9094.44]  So maybe it's not that I didn't have the heart to check. Maybe it's that nobody wanted to tell me
[9098.12 --> 9099.72]  Hello, sir, you're on the WAN show
[9101.40 --> 9102.60]  Sir, this is a wendy's
[9103.88 --> 9107.16]  Yeah, it is. I help you. What can I can I have double cheeseburger?
[9108.20 --> 9111.24]  Um, spicy chicken extra lettuce
[9111.24 --> 9117.80]  I want a double cheeseburger and hold the lettuce. Don't be front and sun. No seeds on the bus. Sorry
[9118.36 --> 9120.60]  Can I get you a frosty?
[9120.60 --> 9120.92]  Um
[9123.72 --> 9127.96]  Sorry grilled or crispy. Sorry. Um, okay. Anyway, the point is that
[9127.96 --> 9130.68]  Uh, the WAN show audience wants to know
[9131.80 --> 9134.84]  How much we ate it on the shipping promo last week?
[9134.84 --> 9136.84]  Uh
[9136.84 --> 9138.84]  Uh
[9138.84 --> 9141.48]  A lot
[9141.48 --> 9145.72]  Um, what do you what do you you look for numbers? What are you looking for here?
[9145.72 --> 9148.28]  I mean numbers are good
[9149.40 --> 9154.28]  Like dollar amount of how much it costs us or what do you know nick? I want your shoe size number
[9154.28 --> 9158.52]  What do you I don't know do you want me to save you lost $80,000 on friday?
[9159.08 --> 9159.64]  Is that right?
[9159.64 --> 9161.40]  Uh, something like that
[9164.84 --> 9167.24]  Well, it was nice uh, it was nice working with you too
[9167.24 --> 9171.72]  So this transaction do I thank you? Do I thank you for the information? Do I?
[9172.44 --> 9176.84]  I think you do actually because it's your fault. It's not his fault. Oh, I see. Yeah
[9176.84 --> 9179.56]  I mean, it was like to be fair. It was a collaborative effort, you know
[9180.52 --> 9183.96]  All right, um, so maybe not then like is that is that net?
[9185.16 --> 9191.08]  No, no, no, that's just shipping. Yeah, that was positive. Really? Oh, obviously
[9191.08 --> 9197.24]  I mean, it was in the report that I sent you earlier this week if you had read it. Yeah, but that was over the entire three days
[9197.80 --> 9200.84]  What about that day? What about those orders? Like
[9200.84 --> 9202.84]  Hold on dude, hold on
[9206.04 --> 9207.32]  It was profitable
[9208.68 --> 9212.04]  Are you accounting for handling costs in your profitability calculation?
[9212.04 --> 9214.04]  Are you accounting for handling costs?
[9214.04 --> 9217.48]  Yes, do you think this is my first day? What are you?
[9217.48 --> 9219.48]  I love you
[9219.48 --> 9221.48]  Just asking God I love this company

[9232.68 --> 9236.04]  Hold on my my Dell computer is taking forever to turn off
[9238.44 --> 9241.80]  That's a feature not a bug it's ready for you to compute anytime
[9243.56 --> 9245.56]  Much computing
[9245.56 --> 9247.08]  Much computational analysis
[9247.08 --> 9250.60]  You try to turn it off old man Dell shows up at your house and just turns it back on
[9251.48 --> 9254.20]  All right, hold on line day recap
[9254.20 --> 9256.20]  Oh

[9267.24 --> 9275.80]  I want to say we did about 30% profit that day let's say
[9275.80 --> 9276.12]  Wow
[9276.84 --> 9278.68]  Even even even counting the shipping so
[9279.40 --> 9279.72]  Really?

[9289.32 --> 9291.96]  Yeah, you know that like people bought backpacks and stuff
[9291.96 --> 9293.64]  Oh, yeah, you did do the call out
[9293.64 --> 9296.44]  Yeah, but you know how much backpacks cost to ship, right?
[9297.48 --> 9298.44]  Uh, yes
[9298.44 --> 9299.48]  Okay, all right
[9299.48 --> 9299.72]  Okay
[9299.72 --> 9303.16]  Are we really gonna do like the quarterly recap off-land show?
[9303.16 --> 9304.76]  No, no, that's not necessary
[9304.76 --> 9305.96]  Okay, all right. Thanks, Nick
[9305.96 --> 9307.32]  Okay, thank you
[9307.32 --> 9308.12]  Okay, goodbye
[9308.12 --> 9309.08]  Goodbye
[9309.08 --> 9311.24]  Wow
[9311.24 --> 9311.80]  Wow
[9311.80 --> 9313.32]  People really bought them backpacks
[9313.32 --> 9313.56]  All right
[9313.56 --> 9314.44]  We were talking
[9315.08 --> 9317.72]  Uh in the parking lot after the show about how like
[9318.28 --> 9319.56]  There are certain people that
[9320.44 --> 9323.72]  Might be in shipping situations where they just would have never ordered
[9324.28 --> 9324.36]  Yeah
[9324.36 --> 9327.72]  So some of the orders were like huge because they were like, okay
[9327.72 --> 9329.56]  Now I'm gonna get all the things I wanted
[9330.92 --> 9333.08]  Yeah, I'm just going back to last Friday here
[9333.08 --> 9333.80]  I have some
[9334.68 --> 9336.52]  You have some concerns about that being accurate?
[9336.52 --> 9340.76]  Uh, no, no, no, I would always uh, I would always trust my team to
[9343.32 --> 9345.64]  Not be that I need to look at the report
[9347.32 --> 9349.16]  Then why do you ask them to talk about it next week?
[9349.16 --> 9354.20]  Uh, I would, I like talking about uh, money a lot
[9356.28 --> 9362.04]  Okay, okay, so okay, the okay, I'm I just for the sake of clarity
[9362.04 --> 9363.24]  Um
[9364.92 --> 9365.64]  Sure
[9365.64 --> 9366.76]  Screw it
[9366.76 --> 9367.96]  Net sales that day
[9367.96 --> 9368.84]  Oh, wow
[9368.84 --> 9368.92]  It was
[9368.92 --> 9369.24]  Wow
[9369.24 --> 9371.08]  Three hundred twenty thousand dollars
[9371.80 --> 9373.72]  We're gonna have to talk to the Taryn about Wancho
[9373.72 --> 9373.96]  It's not
[9373.96 --> 9376.44]  Gross profit was one hundred twenty thousand dollars
[9376.76 --> 9378.92]  And if we spent eighty thousand dollars on shipping
[9379.64 --> 9380.28]  And shipped
[9381.24 --> 9383.48]  Fourteen thousand units of stuff
[9384.12 --> 9386.92]  At an average handling cost of like a couple bucks each
[9386.92 --> 9391.56]  Uh, I think made money is generous
[9392.20 --> 9394.28]  Um, where did the thirty percent come from?
[9394.84 --> 9397.40]  That's that's the that's the gross profit for the day
[9398.36 --> 9398.60]  Uh
[9399.64 --> 9401.56]  Before the shipping shipping is not in there
[9401.56 --> 9401.80]  Yeah
[9403.08 --> 9403.72]  So okay
[9404.60 --> 9405.32]  I see
[9407.16 --> 9407.56]  All right
[9408.20 --> 9408.44]  Yep
[9409.72 --> 9410.52]  That's cool
[9410.52 --> 9411.16]  That's fine
[9411.16 --> 9412.04]  Next merch message
[9412.04 --> 9413.32]  Overall though
[9413.32 --> 9414.92]  Overall though Nick is right
[9414.92 --> 9416.44]  Lime day was a success
[9417.32 --> 9418.76]  Uh, we moved through a lot of dead stock
[9418.76 --> 9421.64]  Uh, we are net positive overall on lime day
[9421.64 --> 9422.76]  Even if the Friday was
[9422.76 --> 9424.04]  People did the math, it's three percent
[9424.04 --> 9425.64]  If the Friday was questionable
[9426.52 --> 9427.40]  Three percent?
[9427.40 --> 9428.84]  Three percent profit
[9428.84 --> 9429.32]  Oh
[9429.32 --> 9430.12]  That's why I once said it
[9430.12 --> 9432.28]  If you worked back at NCX back in the day, that was probably all right
[9432.28 --> 9434.28]  Don't forget that there are costs
[9434.28 --> 9436.60]  No, because that's still not net
[9437.24 --> 9438.20]  There's other costs
[9438.20 --> 9441.80]  Some, okay, so some of the products that we were selling for example are dead stock
[9442.76 --> 9450.20]  So our cost calculation in here doesn't include the uh storage fees that we've accrued for those over the last two years in some cases
[9451.08 --> 9451.32]  So
[9452.04 --> 9452.36]  Yes
[9453.56 --> 9454.12]  But no
[9455.08 --> 9459.48]  Also, there's there's almost inevitably going to be some amount of returns
[9459.72 --> 9459.88]  Yep
[9460.36 --> 9462.36]  Administrative overhead, etc.
[9462.36 --> 9463.40]  Yeah, it's
[9463.40 --> 9464.04]  It's um
[9465.00 --> 9467.64]  It's if you can do a wild promo
[9468.28 --> 9470.52]  And you can be flat for the day
[9471.48 --> 9472.76]  I consider that a W
[9472.76 --> 9474.84]  I'm not criticizing the team
[9474.84 --> 9476.60]  I'm not saying anything went wrong
[9476.60 --> 9477.40]  What was your idea?
[9477.40 --> 9483.88]  Was it not?
[9483.88 --> 9487.56]  Which is well, it's it was it was a it was a team effort collaborative
[9487.56 --> 9491.40]  Yeah, it was it was a team effort like like Nick said it was it was collaborative
[9492.04 --> 9498.04]  Um, and so if you can run a crazy promo that makes the community really happy and excited and people were excited
[9498.04 --> 9501.24]  They were like yeah, absolutely ton of posts on the subreddit and all of that
[9501.24 --> 9502.52]  I got a bunch of messages about it
[9502.52 --> 9506.92]  And if you can if you can by some miracle not lose your shirt on it
[9507.48 --> 9512.04]  Shout out everyone who by the way, you know ordered screwdrivers and backpacks and stuff
[9512.04 --> 9513.80]  That might be why it like is floating on the line
[9513.80 --> 9514.68]  Well, no that is why
[9514.68 --> 9519.72]  Yeah, because the previous two days were actually a much much lower
[9520.28 --> 9521.64]  Uh gross profit percentage
[9522.20 --> 9526.84]  So this one was like 30 or something like that the previous two days were much closer to the wire
[9527.00 --> 9528.92]  But people paid their own shipping, right?
[9528.92 --> 9530.76]  So they they overall
[9531.32 --> 9532.36]  Like made money
[9532.36 --> 9537.64]  Yeah, not much, but they made some and then the friday you guys helped a brother out
[9538.68 --> 9540.92]  Ordered backpacks ordered screwdrivers
[9540.92 --> 9545.56]  We we gave you a handful of like relatively high margin items and you guys were like, let's go
[9545.56 --> 9547.40]  Yeah, sure. I'll get that. Yeah, sure
[9547.40 --> 9552.76]  Um, one of those and the the lime day stuff that's at cost come on here. We go
[9553.32 --> 9558.52]  Um, and so that day ended up being okay, but that's not the kind of thing that we could count on
[9559.40 --> 9559.88]  overall
[9561.00 --> 9565.48]  Like it's not I I feel like some people might have heard that phone conversation and gone
[9565.48 --> 9568.76]  Okay, well you guys should just do free shipping on orders over 150 dollars forever
[9568.76 --> 9577.00]  But that's not actually the case because you can't run a business with all the overhead associated with running a business and reinvesting in new product development
[9579.40 --> 9579.80]  Where is it?
[9580.60 --> 9581.56]  Come on
[9581.56 --> 9583.56]  Like this
[9584.20 --> 9585.80]  Um with like
[9586.60 --> 9590.20]  Razor-thin profits so that's that's how you end up being ncix
[9590.20 --> 9592.20]  um
[9592.92 --> 9594.04]  So
[9594.04 --> 9598.44]  So yeah, don't exist anymore. So yeah overall uh lime day was a big success
[9599.32 --> 9603.24]  massive shout out our community and um and our team and
[9604.36 --> 9606.60]  We're not going to do that kind of thing all the time
[9609.56 --> 9610.52]  Okay
[9610.52 --> 9611.56]  Here we go
[9611.56 --> 9619.40]  Hi, y'all love the show recently received my 13th gen intel framework 13. Do you think that single cable e gpu
[9619.40 --> 9626.44]  Sorry e gpu setups are a viable option in 2023 in my case. It's for games like cs go and eve online
[9626.44 --> 9627.96]  uh, yeah
[9629.48 --> 9634.44]  Eve online and cs god that's a person who picked their games and just stuck with them
[9634.92 --> 9641.24]  Yeah, counter-strike and eve. I like my space games. I like my gun games and I like them both hardcore. Yeah
[9641.72 --> 9642.52]  unforgiving. Yeah
[9642.52 --> 9647.24]  Yeah, I mean you could pick up a very very
[9647.88 --> 9651.56]  E gpu enclosures have gotten shockingly affordable all of a sudden really yeah
[9651.56 --> 9656.76]  I just I've not looked into it. Yeah, I stopped paying attention to them for a few years and they just quietly
[9657.80 --> 9660.44]  Fell down in price by like two hundred dollars like um
[9660.44 --> 9662.44]  Whoa
[9662.44 --> 9667.40]  I was trying to think i'm trying to remember where I was shopping the other day
[9667.96 --> 9672.92]  What the heck is e gpu.io wow, this is a there's a very slow website. Um
[9674.12 --> 9676.28]  Anyway, okay, totally useless
[9676.92 --> 9678.60]  Amazon still thinks they're expensive
[9679.72 --> 9683.48]  No, I was on um, oh, what's that what's that mac brand?
[9684.20 --> 9688.44]  That owc that's the one I didn't even know it. So yeah, cool
[9688.44 --> 9693.64]  Yeah, I was on owc and they had uh an e gpu enclosure. No, I want to stay on the us site
[9695.72 --> 9699.72]  Jaden's asking a good question sure. Are there any real options other than razer core?
[9700.20 --> 9704.60]  Yeah, absolutely this thing maybe how about this thing for 279 dollars? Whoa
[9705.32 --> 9708.92]  Yeah, razer core is 550. Yeah, 650 watt power supply
[9708.92 --> 9712.28]  You can basically power like whatever you want full length full height double width cards
[9712.28 --> 9716.36]  So you will you are a little limited and you can't put like a 40 90 in it or whatever
[9716.36 --> 9720.20]  But that is very reasonable works. I mean
[9721.32 --> 9725.96]  Because a lot of them back in the day were kind of sketchy. Um, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't
[9726.76 --> 9727.96]  Yeah
[9727.96 --> 9735.56]  No, no, really like like yeah, no, it's not as it's not as sketchy these days. Okay, but yeah, these these things are freaking affordable
[9736.36 --> 9742.92]  Um, and so if you if you you know get a gpu like it's especially if you think of it as like a long-term investment
[9742.92 --> 9748.28]  If you are definitely gonna be a laptop guy or a laptop gal
[9749.00 --> 9749.48]  forever
[9749.48 --> 9753.80]  And you're gonna want to upgrade your gpu, you know at some point
[9754.52 --> 9757.96]  Then you can you can start to do the math a little bit differently
[9757.96 --> 9764.12]  You can amortize the cost of your enclosure over multiple gpu upgrades. So instead of costing 280 dollars
[9764.84 --> 9767.64]  Okay, well now i've bought myself two e gpu
[9767.64 --> 9772.28]  So you like you upgrade it down the line now it cost 140 dollars each time or you know
[9772.28 --> 9777.64]  I'm gonna use it for three generations which might be optimistic, but we'll see and you know now it cost me
[9778.84 --> 9781.48]  85 dollars per generation or whatever the case may be
[9782.36 --> 9785.80]  Um, yeah, no, I definitely think it's viable. I would like to see
[9787.16 --> 9792.12]  I would like to see an 8x external interface at some point that actually takes off
[9792.12 --> 9798.76]  But right now it seems to be very early days like framework has that thing that they're building out of the caboose of the framework 16
[9798.76 --> 9801.40]  But that's not really external. It's not even hot pluggable
[9801.80 --> 9805.56]  And then asus has their xg mobile thing
[9806.20 --> 9809.24]  But it's highly proprietary. Um
[9810.04 --> 9814.28]  I don't know msi had that one way back in the day where the laptop just had a slot in the back and you just like
[9814.76 --> 9817.72]  Plugged it into the dock. It just hasn't been standardized
[9817.72 --> 9822.68]  So I don't I don't I don't know what if anything we would see that would replace thunderbolt at this point
[9823.40 --> 9828.60]  But I would like to see something that doubles up the lanes or I mean at the very least moves to gen
[9830.20 --> 9835.72]  Thunderbolt 4 gen 3 bandwidth. I can't remember but we need more bandwidth basically
[9837.16 --> 9842.12]  The one that you brought up was it an akitio akitio. Yeah, okay. Sounds good. I found the same thing
[9842.12 --> 9846.12]  It's hunting around. Oh, yeah. Yeah good reviews at least. Yeah
[9847.08 --> 9849.08]  15 of them. Yeah, okay. Yeah, there you go
[9850.76 --> 9854.44]  Linus, how did you develop your writing and editing style for ltd scripts?
[9854.84 --> 9860.44]  Is this just something you figured out doing so many scripts or did you also get some advice or inspiration from somewhere?
[9860.76 --> 9861.40]  So many
[9862.20 --> 9865.80]  So many, um, i'm also just i'm a sponge. I'm an absorber
[9865.80 --> 9869.88]  You know when I when I encounter something that I like I go
[9870.60 --> 9872.12]  Man, I wish I thought of that
[9873.96 --> 9878.44]  And then I you know, I try to I try to integrate that into into what i'm doing. So
[9878.44 --> 9881.72]  um, and I and I read a lot of comments
[9881.72 --> 9887.00]  I take a lot of feedback and some of it's garbage. Sometimes you guys quite frankly suck at giving feedback
[9887.56 --> 9890.52]  Um, yep, but other times people don't actually know what they want
[9890.52 --> 9895.40]  Yeah, other times you guys are really great at giving feedback and it's it's hugely beneficial. So
[9895.40 --> 9899.64]  So don't stop doing it. You also like I know you don't watch a lot of youtube videos
[9899.96 --> 9902.28]  But I know you pay attention to what's working on youtube
[9902.92 --> 9908.68]  Um to a certain degree at least. Yep. Oh, yeah, i'm watching i'm watching, you know, what is showing up on the home page and then yeah, you know
[9909.00 --> 9910.28]  incognito tab
[9910.28 --> 9911.24]  Absolutely. Yeah
[9912.60 --> 9917.80]  How do you all feel about the new microsoft entra id name for azure active directory?
[9919.32 --> 9920.36]  Microsoft
[9920.36 --> 9922.92]  We talked about this before. It's stupid
[9922.92 --> 9929.64]  Okay, I believe yeah, they just rebranded as yours like oh, yeah, okay, whatever
[9930.28 --> 9934.36]  Yeah, there's I probably forgot because I just don't care negativity around the brand right now cool
[9935.16 --> 9939.08]  um with slow regulation and why to tech illiteracy gap
[9939.56 --> 9946.28]  How do you keep people aware of emerging tech and the risk that they can pose for example scammers mimicking people's voices?
[9946.28 --> 9948.28]  It's hard
[9948.28 --> 9950.28]  Just keep saying it, you know
[9950.92 --> 9954.84]  Tell your friends tell your family tell them to tell their friends tell them to tell your family word of mouth
[9955.24 --> 9956.84]  Is shockingly powerful still
[9957.64 --> 9959.48]  Even in the internet age
[9960.20 --> 9962.68]  It doesn't the power of word of mouth doesn't go away
[9963.08 --> 9965.96]  Like we picked our flooring contractor for our new house
[9965.96 --> 9970.84]  Just based on what the previous owner said that she used and liked because
[9971.64 --> 9975.40]  You know, she seemed like someone who had her had her act together and
[9975.80 --> 9980.60]  It seemed like the quality had held up quite well since you know, 1990, whatever when they built that place
[9981.00 --> 9982.84]  So we just went with the same thing
[9983.56 --> 9986.28]  Because people don't want to do a bunch of research. Yeah
[9987.00 --> 9989.00]  Contrary to what you know reddit thinks
[9989.00 --> 9993.72]  Yeah, they just they want a good option and if and they and they trust someone they have a personal connection with
[9994.28 --> 9999.24]  Far more than they they trust an endorsement from someone that they don't have a personal connection with
[10000.84 --> 10002.84]  Yeah
[10002.84 --> 10006.44]  Hey llnd when shipping the replacement zipper pull on the backpacks
[10006.44 --> 10012.20]  Would it be possible to order something from the store and just have the pulls thrown in with the shipment to save money for you?
[10013.08 --> 10015.64]  I don't think we're going to have any way of managing that and I suspect
[10015.64 --> 10018.04]  We're probably going to end up shipping the pulls from
[10019.00 --> 10022.44]  From asia directly rather than shipping them across the ocean and then shipping them again
[10022.92 --> 10029.24]  Because that would just feel pointless and stupid. So if there's any way for us to do that, that's what we're going to try to do
[10031.64 --> 10035.88]  Question for luke i'm currently producing a tennis challenge in
[10036.60 --> 10040.36]  Gransby and we've run into many glitches with ndi
[10040.36 --> 10044.44]  What's the most stress you've been producing something live and how did you manage
[10045.64 --> 10048.28]  What about me?
[10049.00 --> 10052.44]  I feel like you're a better person to answer this. Oh every single WAN show
[10053.96 --> 10055.96]  Um and extremely badly
[10056.84 --> 10059.88]  Yeah, I mean you're basically um performing
[10060.92 --> 10069.32]  Live in front of you know anywhere from 10 to 20 000 people and your boss and his former boss
[10069.32 --> 10071.72]  Yeah, still sort of and but
[10072.68 --> 10074.68]  One of them's antagonistic
[10075.08 --> 10078.04]  Which one were you pointing at it looked like luke, but that doesn't seem right
[10078.84 --> 10081.64]  You know those those guys. Oh both of them. I mean sometimes
[10081.64 --> 10083.64]  You know what you're going
[10085.96 --> 10088.68]  You have to trust in something
[10089.72 --> 10090.92]  Um
[10090.92 --> 10096.52]  Sometimes it's yourself and most of the times it's not but if you're getting glitches you get one glitch
[10096.52 --> 10099.96]  That's not good enough. You need to have
[10100.68 --> 10107.56]  It be more robust than that. Yeah, five nights five nights every every day of the day. Yeah every day of the week every day of the day
[10108.52 --> 10110.52]  It's okay. It's late
[10111.56 --> 10113.32]  I think I heard I think I literally heard a yawn
[10114.92 --> 10121.48]  Next up hi dll was researching some stuff and saw that all the major os makers are starting to push app
[10121.48 --> 10128.52]  Sandboxing at some level. How do you think anti-cheat devs will react if when this becomes mandatory?
[10128.52 --> 10131.40]  I haven't heard about this. What is uh, what is this sandboxing?
[10132.04 --> 10135.00]  Sandboxing is good. Um anti-cheat devs
[10137.16 --> 10139.16]  I don't know
[10140.28 --> 10142.12]  Because they don't like the vm stuff
[10144.76 --> 10150.28]  I'm not sure I really don't know I i'm not sure if there's some some way that they can
[10150.28 --> 10152.28]  Try to
[10154.52 --> 10159.08]  Honestly, it's it's a battle that must be fought but it's a losing battle
[10159.08 --> 10159.88]  um
[10161.08 --> 10163.72]  In my opinion, so I feel bad for the anti-cheat developers
[10164.28 --> 10164.68]  um
[10166.20 --> 10169.64]  I have pretty much given up on like
[10170.92 --> 10172.04]  really wanting to be
[10173.00 --> 10174.36]  competitive in shooters
[10175.08 --> 10175.48]  because
[10175.48 --> 10182.28]  As far as I can tell every single shooter game is just overrun by cheaters
[10182.92 --> 10183.88]  um
[10187.00 --> 10187.96]  So I don't know
[10189.56 --> 10191.48]  I don't know I have no idea sorry
[10191.48 --> 10198.28]  For someone with little professional experience, but a lot of hobby experience in basic coding python, html, etc
[10198.84 --> 10202.76]  Is data analytics a good starting point or seek other options?
[10203.48 --> 10204.36]  Absolutely could be
[10204.36 --> 10205.08]  um
[10208.12 --> 10213.24]  Yeah, um you can do some data analytics stuff in python you can do data analytics on a lot of different things
[10213.48 --> 10217.40]  um, i'm not 100 certain what the question is is that for like
[10217.40 --> 10223.72]  I don't know if you're asking for like in order to get into a profession or to do something that you think is fun
[10224.12 --> 10225.08]  um
[10225.08 --> 10227.48]  If you're trying to get into a profession, there's
[10228.04 --> 10230.76]  Lots of work out there for lots of different developers. Um
[10232.12 --> 10240.04]  I don't I don't think specifically like like bringing yourself into the specialization of data analytics is going to necessarily do the greatest thing for you
[10240.44 --> 10242.44]  When you could be a little bit more broad
[10242.44 --> 10249.08]  Um, but I am also certain that there is jobs out there for data linux. So yeah, I can't believe we didn't cover this
[10252.36 --> 10255.16]  Oh, oh it's live. I had a question about this as well
[10256.44 --> 10262.20]  Go for it. I know at least one person on my team that is going to buy this jake already pre-ordered it too. Yep
[10263.64 --> 10266.12]  So exciting man, these guys are crushing it
[10267.80 --> 10269.32]  DIY edition pre-built
[10269.96 --> 10270.68]  um
[10270.68 --> 10274.04]  They had such an incredible response
[10274.84 --> 10276.84]  That
[10277.16 --> 10282.36]  Oh my they are now not shipping until q1 of next year
[10283.00 --> 10285.00]  whoa
[10286.44 --> 10293.80]  Every model every single model every single model. Oh my gosh people that were like the second this drops i'm buying it
[10294.12 --> 10297.32]  Which I I never hear with something like a laptop
[10297.32 --> 10299.72]  Maybe for a graphics card?
[10300.68 --> 10301.48]  But yeah
[10301.48 --> 10303.00]  People believe in the mission
[10303.80 --> 10307.08]  Their second attempt first first product great
[10307.80 --> 10308.60]  second product
[10311.24 --> 10311.64]  Wow
[10311.64 --> 10312.36]  um
[10313.00 --> 10317.88]  These guys are absolutely crushing it over there. I'm super excited for them super proud of them
[10317.88 --> 10320.12]  uh, super happy as an investor that
[10320.12 --> 10326.28]  Like I didn't just put my money in a fire because I was willing to but if I don't have to that's great
[10326.84 --> 10328.20]  um, tell me something
[10329.08 --> 10330.84]  How would you guys feel at this point?
[10331.56 --> 10334.04]  If they did another round of funding and I re-upped
[10334.84 --> 10338.28]  Is that is there any additional conflict of interest at this point or
[10338.28 --> 10339.16]  Is that even possible?
[10339.16 --> 10340.12]  Well, no, here's the thing
[10340.68 --> 10345.24]  Because initially the way that I sold this to the community was I really want to support this mission
[10346.04 --> 10346.36]  and
[10346.36 --> 10350.44]  I feel like it's the right thing to do now. I don't think it matters
[10350.68 --> 10352.04]  And i'm willing to kiss the money goodbye
[10352.60 --> 10355.32]  My well, I can tell you now my intent is really different
[10355.96 --> 10358.12]  This time around i'm looking at it going
[10359.40 --> 10364.28]  How about I make some money by putting it in framework because these guys are heading for the freaking moon?
[10364.28 --> 10370.84]  I think that's still does that matter valid because if you're helping them head to the moon, I think that's good
[10372.12 --> 10377.40]  Because you want we've talked a long time ago about how like if you want to enact change
[10378.28 --> 10384.20]  Doing so in a way that makes you money is actually often the best possible way to do it
[10384.20 --> 10390.68]  Because that's the best way to ensure that you continue to have funding nobody seems to care. Yeah, they're like let's go
[10390.68 --> 10394.12]  You already have money in the system. It literally changes genuinely nothing
[10394.28 --> 10396.28]  Well, it changes the percentage I own
[10396.52 --> 10399.64]  Okay, why does that matter? I mean, I don't know. It matters a little
[10399.64 --> 10405.24]  I don't think it matters. I think that's why everyone's saying do it. I'm just I'm just I'm excited
[10405.24 --> 10408.52]  It's good of you to ask. I'm like I'm like yeah, I mean
[10409.00 --> 10413.56]  It is good that you have seeing the way they're executing. I'm just sitting here going. I mean, yeah, take more
[10414.04 --> 10417.16]  It's the most exciting laptop on the market to be clear. I don't have any money right now
[10417.64 --> 10422.84]  I have nothing in it at all. So my statement came from nowhere. Yeah, um like I actually
[10422.84 --> 10427.56]  No, I actually don't we uh, we got the keys for the badminton center
[10428.04 --> 10431.56]  Oh, yeah, that makes sense that you would have no money in the market. I actually
[10432.60 --> 10434.60]  Have no money
[10434.84 --> 10437.16]  Relax, dan. We kept afloat for payroll
[10438.28 --> 10441.24]  That's okay. Maybe they'll pay me one day. Oh, come on
[10441.88 --> 10447.48]  I can't say that. I know i'm just kidding. No, there's no concern if I want to be serious as no concern
[10447.48 --> 10451.96]  Okay, I trust you very much. Yeah, don't don't don't don't trust me trust yvonne
[10452.60 --> 10454.04]  And that's what I was saying her team
[10454.04 --> 10458.04]  That's what I was yeah, I mean we have an accounting team now like five people on the accounting team
[10458.28 --> 10460.28]  It's like when did this happen
[10460.92 --> 10462.92]  I don't get it, you know
[10463.24 --> 10467.24]  It happened just after I started but yeah anyway, the point is that when
[10467.96 --> 10472.12]  When it went and if they were to do another round of funding if I had if I found you know
[10472.12 --> 10477.88]  I you know a couple hundred thousand dollars between the couch cushions like would anybody begrudge me that
[10478.68 --> 10483.16]  Does it does it matter? Sounds like no if you did what sorry if you hid money in coach
[10483.16 --> 10488.92]  No, if I if I found a couple hundred thousand dollars between the couch cushions and wanted to spend it on framework. Oh
[10490.04 --> 10492.04]  Like is that okay?
[10492.76 --> 10497.96]  No, I'm not literally finding it you're getting hung up on finding it in the couch cushions. It's a joke fun to do that though
[10497.96 --> 10499.96]  It's a joke
[10502.12 --> 10504.12]  What he's gonna do is I want your couch cushion
[10505.72 --> 10507.72]  Yeah, can I buy your couch?
[10508.68 --> 10510.68]  They're alpaca wool
[10512.44 --> 10516.60]  That's where all the money went we actually have so much alpaca wool we need to figure out what to do with it
[10517.08 --> 10520.68]  We own like two hundred thousand dollars of alpaca wool give it to framework
[10523.40 --> 10525.40]  Wool laptop
[10526.60 --> 10527.64]  Yeah
[10527.64 --> 10530.52]  Linus tech tip make your make your framework laptop smell
[10530.52 --> 10535.96]  For a limited time when you order a laptop get a miniature laptop cushion made out of
[10536.44 --> 10537.08]  uh
[10537.08 --> 10539.08]  made with alpaca wool stuffing
[10539.08 --> 10543.16]  I think say 1988 in float plane chat has probably the best take here
[10543.56 --> 10547.32]  It could make a difference if he invested a significant portion of his wealth
[10547.96 --> 10552.28]  Right now if they go under it wouldn't be good for linus's finances, but
[10552.92 --> 10554.60]  um, but it wouldn't be life-changing
[10555.24 --> 10557.32]  So yeah, I think that's I think that's I
[10557.88 --> 10560.28]  I think that's a better take than just go for it
[10560.28 --> 10564.04]  But that's someone talking about it from a defense of you standpoint
[10564.28 --> 10570.76]  They're wanting to make sure that you are not too invested sure, but they're they're helping me they're helping me sort of frame it correctly
[10572.20 --> 10577.80]  Okay, but it's still what the question that you were asking was is it like ethically okay for me?
[10577.80 --> 10583.24]  Yeah, and they're saying yes as long as as long as I don't have as long as it's not like
[10583.64 --> 10586.44]  Fight or flight for me to like make it work
[10587.32 --> 10589.48]  Not not fight or flight as long as it's not do or die
[10589.48 --> 10592.36]  So as long as you don't buy twitter and then abandon tesla
[10593.00 --> 10593.32]  Yeah
[10594.84 --> 10599.32]  Yeah, yeah, or or start behaving in a way that negatively impacts
[10600.04 --> 10604.60]  Linus media group because you're too focused on this because i'm too focused on uh on framework fair enough
[10605.16 --> 10609.08]  Oh, man, I it's been it's I know I still haven't done this ceo
[10609.72 --> 10612.28]  Incoming q a stream with you flow playing chat. I'm so sorry
[10612.28 --> 10614.76]  But anyway, here's something the kind of thing that I might talk about in it
[10614.76 --> 10617.08]  If I were to ever get around to doing one I will at some point
[10618.28 --> 10621.96]  Stop it stop shaking your head. I said you're gonna do it like a month and a half ago
[10622.20 --> 10624.04]  I will do it. I will do it just calm down
[10626.84 --> 10630.92]  Anyway, I had a really refreshing conversation with our new ceo today
[10630.92 --> 10636.36]  Um, it was cool because he came to me asking for me to make a decision about something
[10636.92 --> 10640.76]  It was you know whether or not we'd be comfortable working with a makeup brand
[10642.04 --> 10642.36]  and
[10642.36 --> 10643.40]  um
[10644.04 --> 10649.24]  Everyone does that which is why I don't want that job anymore. So I said
[10650.20 --> 10652.36]  I know what I would say, but how about this?
[10652.92 --> 10656.84]  Why don't you tell me what we're gonna do and let's see how closely they match
[10656.84 --> 10661.72]  And he basically goes well, they're an established brand. They're reputable
[10662.36 --> 10667.56]  This particular product seems to have pretty solid overlap with our audience. They have deep pockets
[10667.72 --> 10671.00]  I don't see any reason why we wouldn't do this and I go
[10671.96 --> 10673.32]  cool
[10673.32 --> 10675.32]  That's exactly what I would have said
[10675.32 --> 10680.92]  And now next time we don't need to have this conversation at all and I can trust that we're in good hands
[10681.96 --> 10683.96]  perfect
[10683.96 --> 10690.36]  So yeah, I'm I'm excited. I think it's gonna be I think it's gonna be really good. It's been it's been amazing how long we haven't worked together
[10691.00 --> 10695.80]  And haven't really like we we'll we'd like hang out at events and stuff sometimes or we'd like text sometimes
[10695.80 --> 10696.44]  but
[10696.44 --> 10703.00]  Probably the grand total of time we've spent together since we both left ncix is like maybe 20 hours
[10703.72 --> 10706.68]  I think I never quite realized how how much of
[10707.24 --> 10707.96]  uh
[10707.96 --> 10710.12]  And I might be projecting here and might just be wrong
[10710.12 --> 10715.80]  But how much of your like communication style and certain other things came from him because it's been really weird
[10716.20 --> 10720.12]  It's been really weird working with him because it feels like i've worked with him forever
[10720.84 --> 10723.08]  But i've had probably actually like
[10724.04 --> 10725.40]  five
[10725.40 --> 10728.12]  Or six like not including the retreat
[10729.00 --> 10733.00]  Like specific meetings with him about work, but it feels like i've had like hundreds
[10733.72 --> 10738.92]  And i'm just like this is this is odd. I don't know. I can't tell if that's positive or negative
[10740.28 --> 10746.84]  It's a positive. I told him at our last one. I I he was asking me about something that i'm not gonna specifically bring up
[10746.84 --> 10748.84]  yeah, but I told him like
[10749.48 --> 10751.40]  a bunch of things and then ended it with
[10751.96 --> 10753.96]  like I was concerned
[10753.96 --> 10761.00]  And was pushing back when linus was like originally pitching bringing you on yeah luke was one of the strongest sort of
[10761.80 --> 10765.16]  Well, because from my perspective and he understood this as well from my perspective
[10765.16 --> 10768.36]  I've had two bosses ever that i've worked with that. I thought were good
[10769.40 --> 10772.84]  And i've had a lot of jobs. I was when I was growing up
[10772.84 --> 10774.04]  I was like my mom in that way
[10774.04 --> 10779.48]  I would just rinse through jobs all the time and I like hated the leadership at all of them
[10779.48 --> 10784.36]  And I liked working with linus so so far with my track record the chance
[10784.36 --> 10786.60]  I was gonna like the new guy was really low
[10787.48 --> 10792.20]  And I was like I don't want to like leave because I don't like the new leadership like that would suck
[10793.00 --> 10797.64]  So I was highly concerned about that but the way that working with him has been so far
[10798.68 --> 10800.76]  Has felt eerily familiar
[10802.84 --> 10808.92]  And it's just like oh, okay, this is cool all right this is fine the pitch I gave you guys it feels like more linus
[10808.92 --> 10813.56]  He taught me everything. I know now now i'm concerned for better or for worse
[10814.60 --> 10817.32]  Well, I mean I didn't learn everything down
[10818.28 --> 10819.48]  But what I do know
[10820.04 --> 10826.52]  Came from there and like I brought up I brought up one of the the things that I was happy about was like you and ivan seem to be
[10827.16 --> 10830.04]  endless wells of effort, but you are
[10830.92 --> 10832.20]  two people
[10832.20 --> 10835.56]  Yes, and you were shouldering significantly more than two people worth of work
[10836.12 --> 10842.04]  No matter how hard you tried you weren't gonna be able to do it. So it just whatever so certain things would get kind of
[10842.92 --> 10847.00]  Left aside or not addressed or whatever and now having a person who can do that
[10847.24 --> 10852.12]  So you guys can focus more on what you should be doing just makes a lot of sense and it's good
[10852.84 --> 10856.84]  Yeah, that it's gonna take some time for things to actually really start happening
[10857.40 --> 10860.68]  Because he's only actually been here for like technically two weeks
[10862.28 --> 10867.08]  So like whoa now he's very much in observation mode right now. Yeah, just like makes sense
[10868.52 --> 10874.28]  Yeah, no, it's been good. Yep. All right moving on clear purple screwdriver when
[10874.28 --> 10876.28]  I
[10879.16 --> 10884.12]  How dare you curate that let's get let's get back more positive cash flow, please
[10885.16 --> 10887.16]  um
[10887.24 --> 10889.24]  I mean answer the question
[10891.32 --> 10896.84]  I've already shown a clear screwdriver. I think you guys saw that
[10897.64 --> 10899.64]  um
[10899.64 --> 10903.72]  I think that if we were to stop at clear
[10905.24 --> 10907.80]  That might be kind of short-sighted
[10908.92 --> 10912.28]  However, I will say this we are not
[10912.92 --> 10915.64]  anywhere near doing anything beyond
[10916.52 --> 10920.20]  uh, the next three colorways that we have planned
[10921.00 --> 10921.32]  and
[10921.32 --> 10927.16]  That does not include any tinted clear plastics. We probably want to see how well those alternative colors do
[10927.16 --> 10930.60]  I guess we want to see not just how well they do in terms of sales performance
[10930.92 --> 10935.40]  We're not even there yet first. We need to see how well they do in terms of
[10936.04 --> 10942.12]  Uh in terms of are they manufacturable because we're not redoing our molds to do clear plastic
[10942.44 --> 10946.12]  That is not on the table and the way that clear plastic
[10946.60 --> 10953.72]  Behaves when cooling compared to the really durable chemical resistant really awesome triax material that we're using right now
[10954.36 --> 10958.92]  Is different and we know that we've had prototype clear drivers for probably about a year
[10959.24 --> 10961.16]  So are you going to be selling them with like?
[10961.72 --> 10966.92]  Uh, like a caveat of like it's not as durable. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we'd have to it's not
[10967.48 --> 10968.04]  um
[10968.04 --> 10975.88]  So like a lot of like workshops and stuff that are trying to outfit their workshops with screwdrivers will probably stick with the the triax material ones
[10976.20 --> 10981.00]  But maybe if you're just like I build computers sometimes you can get one of the clear ones. Well, it'll be better than that
[10981.80 --> 10985.72]  Um, like it'll be good. It's just triax is great. Right fair enough. So
[10986.52 --> 10989.96]  You know, it's not like oh, yeah, this is a piece of crap and it's just immediately shattered
[10989.96 --> 10994.04]  It's not like that at all. I mean think about what you probably did to your clear n64 controllers
[10994.68 --> 11001.72]  Right, and they're all fine and it's fine many many decades later. But this is triax right? Yeah, okay. Okay, cool. So
[11002.36 --> 11005.64]  um, yeah, we've we have been aware of
[11005.88 --> 11010.60]  Of the demand for different colorways we had intended to do different colorways much earlier
[11010.60 --> 11016.28]  The problem is that you people ordered so many of them we've sold 150 000 screwdrivers
[11016.76 --> 11021.00]  So keeping up with production getting stubby going all these different colorways
[11021.00 --> 11025.00]  This puts strain on our limited production capacity and that of our partners
[11025.40 --> 11027.72]  So we can't just go to ph and say hey
[11027.72 --> 11033.80]  We need you guys to parallelize your operation immediately so that you can start running six different projects for us at the same time
[11033.80 --> 11035.80]  That's not a thing right? Yeah
[11035.96 --> 11038.92]  Logistics is complicated. The real world is really complicated
[11038.92 --> 11043.80]  Especially when you're trying to do anything at volume like look at the stupid carabiner replacements for the backpack
[11043.80 --> 11045.80]  That's taken a freaking year as well
[11045.80 --> 11050.04]  And it's not because we're not trying it's not because we're not constantly iterating and working on it
[11050.04 --> 11054.84]  It's just that even once we have a solution. We have a solution now. We have a solution today
[11055.80 --> 11060.68]  But it takes time to manufacture a hundred and fifty thousand of anything
[11060.68 --> 11066.04]  Right like if it was just one backpack. Yeah, I could have you I could have you a replacement probably like
[11066.44 --> 11069.96]  In a couple days because we've like got some samples here, but it's not one backpack
[11070.44 --> 11074.52]  And we want to do it in a way that's fair to everyone. So it's it's really just like really challenging
[11074.92 --> 11082.76]  We would have had new colorways like way sooner if you guys didn't keep ordering so many bloody screwdrivers and keeping the production going but
[11082.76 --> 11086.76]  I mean to be clear keep doing it
[11087.72 --> 11089.72]  Like appreciate you guys
[11090.84 --> 11095.24]  He just spent all his money on a badminton center. Please you can keep buying screwdriver. Don't forget the lab
[11095.96 --> 11100.92]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you had already spent I not only like when I said I don't have money
[11100.92 --> 11102.52]  I said it I meant I don't have cash
[11103.24 --> 11105.32]  In terms of like actual like money
[11105.32 --> 11110.36]  It's actually like negative like I have debt. I have much debt on the lab right now
[11110.36 --> 11111.40]  Tends to be how this stuff goes
[11111.40 --> 11116.28]  Don't forget about the debt on the badminton center either. But look, I'm not asking for I'm not asking for your pity
[11116.28 --> 11122.36]  Obviously everything over here is going great. I'm really excited about what the lab's doing really excited for the badminton center
[11122.36 --> 11125.24]  And like, you know, we're killing it. We're killing it
[11126.92 --> 11129.72]  But we we appreciate y'all a lot
[11129.72 --> 11137.32]  Yeah, I thought about the carabiners for the or the the whatever the poles for the backpack recently because
[11137.72 --> 11142.36]  um my the bag that I bring to the gym which no I cannot use an ltd backpack for this
[11142.68 --> 11146.36]  Because I go in the pool and then shower afterwards. So I need a wet area
[11147.16 --> 11150.68]  And the bag that I go to the gym for has a ventilated is your wearer right here
[11151.40 --> 11153.40]  Oh my
[11156.36 --> 11157.40]  HR
[11157.40 --> 11164.36]  Um, um, it has it has an area for wet clothes that ventilates out, which is great. Yeah, um, the the
[11165.24 --> 11167.24]  shoulder strap thing
[11167.40 --> 11169.40]  The class like came apart
[11169.72 --> 11175.40]  Like it it like bent slightly too much so it doesn't really close anymore and it'll just come off
[11175.72 --> 11178.44]  It's so annoying, but I was like i'm not gonna get too mad
[11179.88 --> 11181.88]  Because we're we're going through similar stuff
[11181.88 --> 11187.48]  I'll see you gym bag when that would be kind of sick. Yeah, we'd love to do more bags bags are like
[11188.92 --> 11193.16]  Shockingly big business. I recently became aware of this like influencer bag brand
[11193.96 --> 11200.68]  I'm just i'm looking at it going like okay, and they're they're doing just like obscene amounts of volume like how many people needed like luggage
[11202.36 --> 11209.24]  Luggage has always been so weird to me. Yeah, like the fact that like willowbrook mall had a luggage store in like the early 2000s
[11209.24 --> 11212.36]  That's all they did and they were around for a long time. I was like
[11212.36 --> 11217.24]  How many luggage nobody's ever in the store when you go there? Yeah, like
[11218.84 --> 11220.44]  I don't know
[11220.52 --> 11224.92]  And like everyone that I know that has luggage their luggage is like ancient they bought it like 10 years ago
[11224.92 --> 11228.04]  Yeah, you still have it like I mean if we did a luggage
[11228.04 --> 11231.00]  We'd make sure it totally kicks butt or whatever but like yeah
[11231.40 --> 11233.72]  I just don't know what we'd be adding to the conversation
[11234.36 --> 11237.32]  I'm sure there's actually some to add to the conversation when it comes to luggage
[11237.64 --> 11240.28]  Uh, in my opinion, there's there's a lot you could do
[11241.64 --> 11248.36]  My thing is just like how many of those stores exist and how they are able to revenue that much that they can stay around is
[11248.68 --> 11251.08]  Wild to me. How do they even revenue? Yeah
[11251.08 --> 11259.40]  Hello DLL thanks for all your videos and the WAN show quick question. What happened to the NCIX PC?
[11261.96 --> 11270.36]  Still happening, uh, we've just been really busy in the lead up to LTX and the people who are helping Tanner with the uh with the NCIX
[11271.00 --> 11273.48]  wall PC are busy getting ready for LTX
[11273.48 --> 11282.52]  Oh, you're gonna make me read this one. Okay, how diddly do my absolute giga chads any word on the backpack?
[11282.68 --> 11287.24]  Well when the backpacks start shipping with the new zipper pulls, sorry zipper pulls
[11287.56 --> 11294.68]  I'm eagerly waiting. P.S. Tell my friend Alex. He's an idiot. Um, all right. I was gonna edit the last bit Dan
[11296.60 --> 11299.40]  Rude wow, how could you say that on this show?
[11299.40 --> 11303.96]  How he knows how he knows how can you be that mean to Alex L. Huh?
[11304.68 --> 11308.52]  I'm just i'm just reading the copy on the prompter gosh, that's what they pay me to do
[11311.08 --> 11313.72]  Um, yeah backpacks shipping zipper pulls new zipper pulls
[11314.28 --> 11320.20]  Um, I don't know it depends on production lead times. It depends on if we're able to figure out how to
[11321.16 --> 11323.48]  um ship directly out of asia
[11323.48 --> 11329.32]  It depends on whether a boat full of backpacks ever actually makes it through the vancouver port
[11332.20 --> 11337.16]  We are running short on our original 40 000 unit order though. We're we're running pretty low
[11338.20 --> 11340.20]  So we're gonna see how that goes
[11341.48 --> 11344.44]  Luckily for you this european forgot to order last week
[11346.12 --> 11348.44]  For all of you, what's your favorite meal to make yourself?
[11348.44 --> 11355.00]  It's not really a meal but man, I cannot resist like spicy instant noodles
[11355.72 --> 11358.92]  Oh, yeah, that's a that's a bit of a guilty pleasure for me too
[11359.72 --> 11361.48]  Yeah, with a poached egg
[11362.68 --> 11363.80]  Not poached
[11363.80 --> 11369.80]  No, I scramble it. I I throw in some egg just to have some like justification for consuming that garbage
[11370.04 --> 11377.56]  You don't poach it in the broth. No, I uh, I I can't handle yolk on its own. The taste of yolk is disgusting. I have to scramble eggs to eat them
[11378.44 --> 11380.44]  Um
[11381.00 --> 11385.48]  I have kind of two there's the inverted chicken cordon bleu thing, which I won't go into again
[11385.80 --> 11387.80]  Um, and then they get some laid
[11389.40 --> 11397.48]  And then there's also this, uh, I started making this soup, you know, zappa to scanna from olive garden. Nope. Okay. Well, it's a soup from all of garden
[11397.48 --> 11399.48]  That's super good
[11399.48 --> 11400.84]  And for my birthday every year
[11400.84 --> 11407.16]  I used to bring my family to olive garden and we would get the soup salad and breadsticks combo because it was unlimited for all of them
[11407.16 --> 11409.80]  And I'll just have a whole bunch of zappa to scanna because I love that soup
[11410.36 --> 11411.16]  Um
[11411.16 --> 11413.72]  And then I went and wanted to make it for myself one day
[11413.72 --> 11418.20]  So I was like maybe I should just make some of my own and I realized how incredibly bad for you
[11418.20 --> 11421.40]  It is because it's made with just like heavy creamer and right all that kind of stuff
[11421.64 --> 11424.36]  So I was like, okay, i'm gonna make my own version of this
[11424.36 --> 11429.32]  I'm gonna try to accomplish making the reasons why I like this thing, but without so much of the bad stuff
[11429.32 --> 11430.92]  So using like
[11430.92 --> 11433.64]  chicken broth and and things like that instead of heavy creamer
[11433.64 --> 11438.76]  And I I don't know what to call it anymore because it's almost everything in it has completely changed
[11438.76 --> 11443.48]  I use like kale and chicken broth and it's very specific type of sausage and all this other kind of stuff
[11443.48 --> 11446.20]  so whatever my version of that is, but I
[11447.08 --> 11449.32]  Love it. I like it more than the original
[11449.32 --> 11452.44]  um, it's like good for you now and stuff
[11453.00 --> 11459.80]  And uh, I like making that but I make it fairly rarely. It's very much a winter soup. What did you call it?
[11460.76 --> 11467.56]  Uh, the the the soup that you like olive garden version was I believe it's just called zappa to scanna
[11468.04 --> 11470.04]  but zappa to theseus
[11471.48 --> 11478.36]  If you've changed everything in it, I love it. I do believe everything has changed and that is still how I reference it. So yeah royalties, please
[11479.56 --> 11481.56]  Absolutely
[11481.56 --> 11487.48]  Up next hey lld think we'll ever see a mainline framework style decent phone
[11488.60 --> 11490.60]  I mean i'd love to see it, but
[11492.28 --> 11496.04]  It's gonna be a whole new set of challenges and it's gonna be really difficult man
[11497.24 --> 11499.24]  I don't know what else to tell you
[11500.20 --> 11504.76]  Booyah ldx merch ordered thanks for me signing up to floatplane for the first time ever
[11505.32 --> 11511.72]  Question for lld. What is the best and dumbest convention swag you've either purchased or have been given?
[11515.48 --> 11515.88]  Wow
[11516.52 --> 11521.88]  I'm 100 certain there's been a lot of it, but I feel like I wouldn't remember it because I just throw it out
[11522.28 --> 11524.68]  Um, yeah, I was hoping you would have something for this
[11524.68 --> 11530.28]  I curated it because I can't remember a single like convention swag item that I've ever been given
[11530.28 --> 11536.60]  I still I I literally have I have a tile from nvidia on my keys right now. Oh, okay. That's not dumb though
[11536.68 --> 11541.24]  No, it's sweet, but that's my problem. Like I I remember a fair amount of convention swag
[11541.80 --> 11549.96]  Um, there's even been some like actually really cool shirts. I didn't like the brand but astro gaming had a really cool shirt back in the day
[11550.44 --> 11556.76]  Um, like bad screwdrivers were really common in tech for a bit there. Yeah, like really awful screwdrivers. Yeah
[11556.76 --> 11560.44]  Uh, msi had this pen. I was so traumatized. I made my own
[11562.52 --> 11567.16]  MSI had this pen set where there's all these different colors of pens, but all the pens are so bad
[11567.88 --> 11574.04]  Just never work. I got a really cool one from iBuyPower back in the day. You know, they're like like cougar like
[11574.76 --> 11582.12]  Like logo it was thumb screws for your pci slots that I remember those. That's pretty cool. Those were sick. Weren't they gold too?
[11582.12 --> 11585.88]  Yeah, yeah, those were very blimmy. There's been a bunch of really cool swag
[11585.88 --> 11591.08]  But honestly like if it's trash swag it doesn't even make it out of the convention center. I'll just garbage can it before i'm out
[11591.64 --> 11594.20]  Um, or just not take it in the first place if that's an option
[11594.52 --> 11599.24]  I think I still have a teeny tiny little pillow from a yacht convention
[11599.24 --> 11600.36]  I went to once
[11600.36 --> 11603.88]  Uh, there's like three by three inch tiny little pillow that was for
[11604.52 --> 11610.44]  Fabric samples if you wanted your yacht couches to be done in this fabric. That was kind of weird
[11612.76 --> 11619.24]  Nick corrects me. It is not two hundred thousand dollars of alpaca wool. It is less than one hundred thousand dollars of alpaca wool
[11619.32 --> 11622.52]  That's good. All that means to me is that it could be nine hundred
[11623.72 --> 11630.36]  99,999 dollars of alpaca wool. It's still not 200 000 it's less than half of what you thought. That's true
[11632.52 --> 11638.44]  Hey, linus and luke when looking for buildings for lmg have you ever looked at taking over a dead mall?
[11638.44 --> 11643.56]  The company I work for is leasing a hundred thousand square foot facility for a car museum
[11644.12 --> 11648.36]  There aren't any yeah, not here. This is we don't have that problem in Canada
[11649.16 --> 11655.16]  Yeah, I mean i'm sure there's parts of canada that have that same problem, but vancouver ain't it chief. Yep
[11656.28 --> 11664.76]  Ltt.dll two questions one thoughts on how I could donate my old 5950x motherboard and ram to computer science students
[11664.76 --> 11670.84]  Or and two would you ever sponsor tech students or hire interns once labs is up?
[11670.84 --> 11674.52]  Um, as far as donations go, I have no idea
[11675.16 --> 11677.72]  Um, how to make sure that it gets to the right place
[11677.72 --> 11680.60]  I mean, that's something I think pretty much every charity struggles with
[11681.16 --> 11685.80]  As for sponsoring tech students or hiring interns once labs is up apparently we already do
[11685.80 --> 11688.20]  Uh, we've taken on some inter paid
[11689.64 --> 11693.80]  Um, we've we've taken on some interns and uh gary's coordinating all of that
[11693.80 --> 11698.68]  I basically told him I think it's stupid and a waste of time and he said he thinks it's good and not a waste of time
[11698.68 --> 11702.12]  And I said, okay, see you later. They have a type of task
[11702.12 --> 11705.48]  They have some tasks in a category that I do believe it makes sense for
[11706.04 --> 11708.04]  I don't think it would make sense for
[11708.20 --> 11711.40]  Um, like float plane i've never thought it made sense for float plane, but
[11711.40 --> 11716.84]  Uh, some of their tasking I think it's I think it's smart. I think he's doing the right thing and giving people a really cool opportunity
[11716.84 --> 11719.24]  So I think it's working in both for both sides good
[11719.72 --> 11725.64]  This one's for luke. Hey, uh, ldl. I work at a company that makes spacecraft mechanisms and other spacecraft
[11725.96 --> 11730.12]  Luke seems to have a good time at nasa if you had a chance to visit a company like us would he want to
[11730.76 --> 11732.76]  I told you there was two
[11734.36 --> 11738.28]  All right, this is amazing email us yeah archive
[11738.28 --> 11748.12]  And it's gone do you expect apple to try and avoid the eu mandating usbc and removable batteries on phones in the current coming years?
[11748.12 --> 11750.12]  Yes
[11750.60 --> 11752.12]  Hey ldl
[11752.12 --> 11759.24]  What are the chances? Yeah easy? What are the chances of getting some jeans from ldt? I work in hvac and i've been cooking no
[11759.64 --> 11766.12]  No, no jeans jeans are really hard. Yeah, it's a difficult material to work with and people have
[11767.08 --> 11770.84]  Wow, do they ever have expectations when it comes to jean fit and sizing?
[11771.40 --> 11775.00]  I think the closest you're going to get from us is our upcoming cargo pants for the time being
[11775.80 --> 11779.32]  Hey luke, could you talk a bit about floatplanes monthly internal dev day?
[11779.56 --> 11784.84]  I'm trying to sell the idea to my boss on also linus. I forgot to use the free shipping code. You're welcome
[11785.56 --> 11789.88]  I uh, we've been struggling to actuate it recently due to um
[11790.44 --> 11796.84]  Goal structures and stuff like that, but effectively how it works was it's supposed to be the the last friday of every month
[11796.84 --> 11798.84]  We have something called creative day
[11798.92 --> 11799.80]  um
[11799.80 --> 11800.84]  And
[11800.84 --> 11804.36]  The idea behind creative day is you get to work on whatever you want
[11804.84 --> 11806.84]  um
[11806.84 --> 11807.72]  And
[11807.72 --> 11813.96]  It's whatever you want as long as it could plausibly maybe bring benefit to the company
[11813.96 --> 11817.08]  There's only ever been one time where i've shot something down. Um
[11819.00 --> 11823.16]  And every everything else has been accepted there's been some really fantastic things that have come from it
[11823.40 --> 11827.00]  There's been some stuff that we will definitely never use and won't see the light of day
[11828.36 --> 11831.24]  That's fine mostly because we get the really fantastic things
[11831.80 --> 11834.84]  If you're trying to sell this to your boss something that we got
[11835.48 --> 11840.12]  From one of those is the thing that you used to talk to me right now
[11840.12 --> 11846.60]  Which is merch messages at the bottom of the screen which by the way is quite profitable. Yeah two persons boss. It works well
[11847.00 --> 11849.00]  Um, we're we're gonna get it
[11849.00 --> 11853.16]  It's been kind of not really used for a little while now, but we're gonna get it going again
[11853.40 --> 11854.60]  The labs web team
[11855.16 --> 11860.28]  Did a version of it recently and what might happen to the floatplane one is how it works might change a little bit
[11860.84 --> 11863.40]  What the labs web team did was at the end of the quarter?
[11863.40 --> 11866.84]  They had a little bit of not much, but they had a little bit of time
[11867.24 --> 11871.88]  Um, that was kind of spare because they they finished their goals just slightly ahead of time
[11872.36 --> 11874.36]  Um, so we did a little hackathon
[11875.24 --> 11880.76]  And that was awesome. We got some very very cool projects out of the hackathon and what we learned from that
[11880.76 --> 11885.64]  However, is moving forward. It's very likely that we will theme these types of events
[11886.36 --> 11890.84]  Because an issue that we had with the floatplane ones and an issue that we had with the labs ones
[11891.16 --> 11896.20]  Is people were a little lost for what to do and I find when people need to be creative
[11896.20 --> 11901.96]  It often helps when you kind of put bumpers on there like bowling bumpers like kind of keep them in a bit of a lane
[11903.16 --> 11907.80]  It can get them to generate ideas kind of easier sometimes. So yeah
[11909.24 --> 11912.76]  Hi DLL any updates on selling things at micro center?
[11912.76 --> 11915.48]  I'm an associate and would love to see your products in the stores
[11915.48 --> 11922.76]  P.S. The button down makes a great killer work shirt
[11924.28 --> 11927.96]  I only I only curated this because of the great plug for the button down shirt
[11928.84 --> 11930.84]  Uh, no updates. Sorry
[11932.92 --> 11935.24]  DLL a game called food court
[11935.88 --> 11941.56]  Build your perfect meal example of my favorite fries are fresh mcdonald's favorite burgers harvey's favorite onion rings, etc. What perfect?
[11942.04 --> 11945.32]  You know, would you get i'm gonna add the stipulation that it has to be fast food?
[11946.92 --> 11954.28]  What's your fast food combo? Okay, so mine is the some something they have to remember? Yeah, are we are we okay?
[11954.28 --> 11959.72]  Canadian. Yes, so Canada terrible fast food across the board all of our fast food is
[11960.68 --> 11962.68]  K&W is way better than yours
[11963.48 --> 11965.48]  That's the only one we got
[11965.48 --> 11972.68]  Okay, so um, I would probably I'd probably just go for the classic a&w teen burger
[11972.68 --> 11978.04]  Which is not the same as the american one the american one is actual literal garbage, and I wouldn't feed it to my dog
[11978.60 --> 11982.92]  um, i'm gonna go with tim hortons the tim hortons lemon iced tea
[11983.80 --> 11990.60]  Um, it's just their their brewed iced tea is is really good and my fries have got to be mcdonald's i'm sorry
[11990.60 --> 11994.28]  I man when the kids like ask for mcdonald's
[11994.84 --> 11998.44]  I almost always when they ask for fries. I almost always say yes, so I can steal a few
[11998.44 --> 12000.60]  I don't want to eat a whole thing of them because it's like really
[12001.16 --> 12005.56]  It's just garbage. Yeah, but I I eat a few every time yeah mcdonald's fries
[12006.28 --> 12010.44]  But i'm going with a wendy's spicy chicken with extra lettuce and added bacon
[12011.24 --> 12015.24]  Mm-hmm. Just makes a whole world of difference beverage. Oh
[12016.52 --> 12021.00]  I want to take back my beverage, but go ahead ditch the beverage no beverage get a frosty
[12022.04 --> 12024.60]  That was what I was about to say chocolate frosty. Yeah
[12025.16 --> 12028.76]  Yeah, I was like as soon as you said wendy's I realized I screwed up my beverage
[12029.08 --> 12031.40]  Yeah, the the teen burger is a very good choice
[12032.04 --> 12034.20]  but the spicy chicken just
[12036.12 --> 12039.40]  There are definitely days where I would prefer the the teen burger
[12039.88 --> 12045.16]  But I think overall if i'm going for percentages i'm more often gonna want the spicy chicken
[12045.80 --> 12049.72]  But like I really the the added lettuce and the added bacon like
[12051.80 --> 12053.80]  So good
[12054.60 --> 12057.88]  Hey, align us would ltd exist if you never met luke
[12057.88 --> 12060.20]  Oh
[12060.84 --> 12062.28]  This is a good one. Um, yes
[12062.28 --> 12063.40]  I mean
[12063.40 --> 12067.88]  It existed before luke, so the answer to that question is sort of self
[12068.60 --> 12069.16]  apparent
[12070.44 --> 12070.92]  However
[12071.88 --> 12074.04]  would ltd would lmg
[12074.44 --> 12074.76]  Yeah
[12075.16 --> 12080.04]  Exist in its current form without luke and I think the answer there is definitely not
[12080.04 --> 12080.60]  Yeah, I don't
[12080.60 --> 12081.16]  I don't think so
[12081.16 --> 12084.12]  A lot of the key ingredients were there
[12084.84 --> 12088.52]  Um, I was there. Yvonne was there ed for that matter was there
[12088.60 --> 12092.92]  So that's that's three quarters of the original team luke wasn't involved in the hiring of ed
[12093.48 --> 12094.92]  Although here's the thing
[12095.48 --> 12095.88]  um
[12095.88 --> 12100.84]  Um, by that time luke already had my ear
[12101.48 --> 12105.56]  And was I shouldn't say wasn't involved he didn't make the decision
[12106.20 --> 12107.16]  But we talked about it
[12107.96 --> 12112.60]  And it was the conversations that we had that
[12113.64 --> 12117.88]  Was part of what led me to gain the confidence
[12118.44 --> 12121.08]  To leave ncix and go on my own
[12121.72 --> 12127.64]  Luke has also been a key guiding star for our corporate moral compass
[12127.64 --> 12130.76]  I think that we're both really well aligned
[12131.80 --> 12132.36]  However
[12133.48 --> 12135.48]  There's a certain kind of gravity effect
[12136.04 --> 12136.28]  Right?
[12136.28 --> 12140.12]  Um, when you have like-minded people around you
[12140.12 --> 12142.52]  It's easier to stay on course
[12143.24 --> 12148.36]  Versus when you're just in a bubble surrounded by people who don't have the same alignment
[12148.36 --> 12153.08]  So your question is really difficult to answer because
[12154.36 --> 12160.68]  Almost everything that's happened since we met has been impacted by the other
[12163.00 --> 12165.08]  So yes because it existed already anyway
[12165.08 --> 12166.84]  line of sectors was already a thing so
[12166.84 --> 12167.08]  but
[12168.60 --> 12172.44]  No, um, not exactly like this. I mean, I don't
[12172.44 --> 12175.48]  I have a I've thought about this before I have a feeling
[12175.48 --> 12179.00]  I I don't think so
[12179.96 --> 12181.48]  I mean, there'd be no WAN show
[12181.48 --> 12183.40]  Yeah, there'd be no forum
[12183.40 --> 12185.80]  I had no capability to put up a forum
[12185.80 --> 12187.48]  Which was a big part of how we've
[12188.36 --> 12189.88]  Created the community we have
[12190.68 --> 12194.52]  And it was bigger than it was more important when we initially went
[12195.16 --> 12198.76]  Um, the peak user count hasn't changed in like a really long. Yeah
[12199.24 --> 12202.12]  So like a lot of the formative stuff right was um
[12202.12 --> 12204.12]  Um
[12204.68 --> 12208.28]  So what linus is saying is you've encouraged his destructive personality
[12211.16 --> 12214.44]  Okay, this destructive personality has worked out pretty good. Yeah
[12215.08 --> 12221.72]  Pretty good overall. I think everyone everyone here is employed at least partially thanks to this destructive personality
[12223.64 --> 12229.72]  Yeah, right here everyone here would be employed anyway, but I don't I personally this is the thought process i've gone through
[12229.72 --> 12231.80]  I don't think you would have stayed at ncx though
[12232.52 --> 12238.44]  No, yeah, but I don't think I don't necessarily think lmg would exist or it definitely wouldn't exist in the same way
[12238.84 --> 12241.80]  I I feel like you would have it might have just been ltt
[12242.60 --> 12245.16]  Potentially that might not have been lmg. Yeah
[12245.88 --> 12249.32]  Like you might have joined someone else. What was the what was the group?
[12251.32 --> 12254.52]  Because I did push pretty when there was conversations about yeah
[12254.52 --> 12257.72]  creating lmg I did push pretty hard for you to do it
[12258.28 --> 12259.24]  Yeah, absolutely
[12259.72 --> 12261.64]  So I think the chance that you would have just
[12262.28 --> 12267.88]  Potentially gone and worked for some of the other kind of options that were on the table at the time because there was a few if I remember correctly
[12268.60 --> 12272.12]  Would go up. I don't know necessarily that it would be guaranteed, but it would go up
[12273.72 --> 12275.72]  We were both pretty down with
[12275.72 --> 12280.60]  The concept of like internet video being the next thing at the time
[12281.16 --> 12283.40]  um, which ages us a little bit
[12283.88 --> 12285.00]  um
[12285.00 --> 12290.12]  But yeah, so I think it's it would definitely be possible that you could have just decided to split off and do it anyways
[12291.64 --> 12296.84]  By the way shoot. I shouldn't have sent you those videos. I sent you earlier. Did you like look at them in detail?
[12297.88 --> 12301.88]  Not really good. Don't oh why just don't don't worry about it. Okay
[12301.88 --> 12303.88]  I
[12304.20 --> 12307.00]  Remember them pretty well. That's fine. Okay
[12309.72 --> 12311.80]  We will give no details about what that was nope
[12313.00 --> 12318.04]  Hi DLL great show question for luke. Did you ever watch dragon ball zed abridged?
[12318.36 --> 12324.92]  I'm asking because there's a really tall android that always shouts hi bird when he sees a bird reminds me of you
[12324.92 --> 12328.36]  I curated this we're not answering that's the like stupid question, but
[12329.16 --> 12333.96]  But I just thought it was really funny. No, it's not a stupid question. I'm just i'm bugging you. I'm bugging you. No, I haven't
[12333.96 --> 12335.88]  Yeah, that's really funny
[12335.88 --> 12342.36]  But I but I knew he hadn't so that's what made it the question not the important part to me. I just the hi bird
[12343.32 --> 12345.32]  I just imagine luke doing that. It's very funny
[12347.08 --> 12355.40]  Beat saber at ltx. I can't go but i'd love to know how bad bad linus's godly skill in lazlo supernova can be beat by
[12355.40 --> 12358.84]  Good luck
[12359.08 --> 12363.32]  I'm, very excited. Uh, actually i'm i'm pretty rusty. I haven't been playing enough lately
[12363.32 --> 12368.76]  So i'm like not that strong and the endurance matters a lot in the really hard songs do
[12369.88 --> 12371.88]  Not take that as he is bad
[12374.44 --> 12376.44]  That man is terrifying
[12376.44 --> 12378.44]  Shall we move into potentials? Yeah
[12379.08 --> 12385.24]  Hey dll luke, do you still play and recommend orna? What do you think of the latest update? Thanks for the show?
[12385.40 --> 12387.40]  I do not play it anymore
[12387.56 --> 12389.56]  somewhat somewhat begrudgingly
[12389.56 --> 12393.80]  I heard after I quit that they changed some things that made this a little bit better, but
[12394.84 --> 12396.36]  The entire reason
[12397.00 --> 12401.08]  Why I played that game and the entire reason why I enjoyed that game
[12401.48 --> 12406.68]  Was because the thing that I didn't like in the past about pokemon go which I heard might be fixed now
[12407.08 --> 12411.00]  Is that uh, the first thing I ever tried to do I was like i'm gonna go get a geo dude
[12411.00 --> 12414.60]  And I hiked a mountain and then realized that there's basically no pokemon out in the wild
[12415.24 --> 12419.88]  Orna wasn't like that you could go anywhere and there was there was stuff there's things to do so it encouraged
[12420.44 --> 12427.16]  Wandering it encouraged going out and and going for a walk or even jumping on a bike or or going for a run or whatever
[12427.16 --> 12429.00]  And taking pauses every once in a while to do things
[12429.56 --> 12432.36]  Um, it it encouraged getting outside
[12433.16 --> 12436.20]  The problem that I had with orna was once you got to a certain point
[12437.96 --> 12439.72]  It like discouraged that
[12440.44 --> 12445.00]  Uh, the the things that you gained benefit from were like doing crap in your town
[12445.00 --> 12447.40]  Which was naturally going to be built around where you lived
[12448.12 --> 12454.28]  So like you you it it literally made it actively bad for you to go out for a walk
[12454.28 --> 12457.64]  And i'm like this is the whole reason why I got this game again
[12457.64 --> 12462.76]  I've heard they've updated and maybe fix some of that, but yeah, I do not play anymore because of that reason
[12463.32 --> 12465.32]  um
[12465.88 --> 12467.32]  Yeah, that's it
[12467.32 --> 12471.32]  Are there any trendy services that you still use and think is worth it?
[12471.72 --> 12472.28]  What does that mean?
[12472.28 --> 12476.36]  It's a tough one. I have services I subscribe to like I subscribe to home assistant
[12476.36 --> 12478.60]  I don't think that's particularly trendy
[12479.24 --> 12479.64]  um
[12480.76 --> 12483.80]  I actually genuinely don't know what this means. Oh like a tr
[12483.80 --> 12488.44]  I think a trendy service would be something like uh like a meal prep service or something like that. Oh
[12489.24 --> 12495.56]  You know or like, uh, or like, uh, I I would say like, uh, what's that bike that everyone loved and then hated or something?
[12496.28 --> 12498.28]  Because they had a bad commercial and Ryan Reynolds mocked them
[12498.28 --> 12503.08]  Yeah, yeah, or like a peloton subscription. Like do you have anything like that? Not really? No, I I
[12503.08 --> 12506.20]  I promote the idea especially if you're trying to learn how to cook
[12506.60 --> 12509.16]  um to subscribe to one of those uh
[12509.72 --> 12515.64]  ingredients delivery services because that come with like a recipe subscribe to one of those for like
[12515.96 --> 12518.92]  I don't know like two three months or something and then cancel it
[12518.92 --> 12525.64]  Yeah, I don't have any mystery boxes or like no. Yeah, those are super dead. Eh, I think I haven't heard about
[12525.64 --> 12529.32]  Those like you have no idea. I mean mark rober has one
[12530.12 --> 12533.24]  But that's probably good. So yeah, I don't know that I
[12533.88 --> 12536.36]  If it's terrible or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[12536.92 --> 12539.80]  Um, but I just I would imagine it would be pretty okay
[12539.96 --> 12543.32]  No, i'm trying to think the only things I can think of for a subscription is like
[12543.88 --> 12545.40]  YouTube premium
[12545.56 --> 12547.56]  Does chat gpt count?
[12547.56 --> 12549.56]  No
[12550.12 --> 12551.08]  Up next
[12551.08 --> 12553.08]  I think this is our last one actually
[12553.72 --> 12557.08]  So lld nope, I replied to it. Okay, we're done. We'll see you again next week
[12557.80 --> 12563.40]  Same no other more different bad time. Yes, same bad channel. Correct. Bye
[12564.92 --> 12567.16]  You almost did the thing before bye. It was close
[12573.56 --> 12575.56]  Bye
[12583.08 --> 12585.08]  You
[12585.08 --> 12589.08]  You

[12591.80 --> 12593.80]  You
[12593.80 --> 12595.80]  You
[12595.80 --> 12597.80]  You
[12597.80 --> 12600.52]  You
[12600.52 --> 12602.52]  You
[12602.52 --> 12604.52]  You
