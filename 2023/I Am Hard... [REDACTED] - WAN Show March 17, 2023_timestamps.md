2:05:46 - I love Luke's excitement over AI, but I'm gonna hafta pump the brakes here and disagree. Samsung is being disingenuous and vague with their marketing, misrepresenting the feature. Big surprise amirite?
Think of it this way, what reason would an amature astronomer or enthusiast have to be taking a photo of the moon on their cheap Samsung phone, if not because there was something interesting about it that they wanted to preserve in that moment, like a lunar eclipse, waxing/waning crescents juxtaposed against something else, rather than investing in some more costly, but FAR better kit and glass to point and photograph said events.
If I see something neat going on with the moon, I wanna snap a picture of THAT event, blurry as it may be (because I'm well aware the phone doesn't have a 24" celestron bolted to it), rather than an AI model's interpretation of said event, or a hi-res stamp that the AI is programmed to slap on pictures it detects as the moon... 

I'm well aware that AI zoom has existed for a bit now, and its wonderful for "de-blurring" photos and even video now, but this seems to go way more than and just generate a new AI image for ya... Not the direction we need to be going.

Edit- got the timestamp wrong

Here is a timestamp from someone who skimmed it:
0:00 show starts promises headlines
0:30 Linus mentions being cancelled
1:00 Linus talks about home network stuff or something stalls talking about being cancelled
39:04 Ryan Reynolds talk Mint Mobile
42:00 I stopped watching after skimming too long

I have been watching the WAN show off and on for probably a year, and always skipped around (thanks, Timestamp Guy!) because it was just too long.

For some reason, though, now that you're doing 3-4 hour shows, I tend to listen to every second. Maybe it's because you let yourselves really dig in? Maybe it's the recent explosion of AI and Luke's infectious enthusiasm. I don't know, but I do more than just read the comments on these shows lately.
