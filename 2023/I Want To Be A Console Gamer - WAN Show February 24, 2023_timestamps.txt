Speaking of non-fun and unintuitive ways to fight bosses in JRPG you don't know how frustrating Square-Enix's FFXI MMORPG was, specially with a couple of endgame loot bosses. If you played FFXI you'll know how infamous Absolute Virtue and later Pandemonium Warden became to the MMO community. For Absolute Virtue, its damage output and regen were ridiculous, even for the 18 player alliance that would directly engage it plus whatever numbers  you'd add for indirect support, not to mention the sequence by which you had to kill the sub-bosses it summons  to cancel that boss buffs so that you could finally kill it were non intuitive. People found how to cheat the fight. Square-Enix found out and patched the loophole and said players were not fighting the boss in the intended way.  S-E later released a demo video of the dev team fighting it with only 18 people and 'killing it' easy-peasy. It contained a few hints, not all, to how to fight the boss, but people called out S-E dev team for even being bigger cheaters,  from the video and clock timestamps people figured the dev teams 18ppl healing was not something that would be kept against that boss with that number of people without outside help and most importantly they were not respecting recast times for key spells and abilities. Then the next expansion'' s  Pandemonium Warden made the news by having 36 people from a guild not being able to defeat it even after 18 hours fighting it and some even getting sick. So much coverage it got from the media that S-E had to patch it to lower the difficulty and add a 2 hour time limit.
