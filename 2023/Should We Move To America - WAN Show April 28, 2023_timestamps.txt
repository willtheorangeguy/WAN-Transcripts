Linus has claimed that you can understand a YouTube video by reading only the comments, so I popped the first 10 or so comments into GPT4... here is what it came up with: 

"Based on the comments and timestamps, this YouTube video is an episode of Linus Tech Tips' WAN show, which covers various technology-related topics. The main topics discussed in the video include Canada's Bill C11, AMD's burnt chips, the ROG ALLY, School Chromebooks, Twitter re-verification, Linus' cosmetic surgery, LTX 2023 Update, the Activision Blizzard merger being blocked, and Colorado farmers winning the right to repair. The video also features several merch messages, discussions about various tech products and concepts, and a bonus topic about Luke's NASA trip. The comments suggest that the video also touches on the protection of Canadian culture, the use of Chromebooks in schools, and the impact of potential changes to YouTube algorithms on Canadian content."

20:30 I consider myself Texan first and American as a close second (American by birth; Texan by the grace of God), even though I'm against succession, so I love it when we get called out specifically.

Edit: timestamp.

Sorry to say, since the show gets longer than one hour (or so), I skip watching most of them. 2, 3 or even more hours of the show is coming a burden to watch now...  
Content seems to be still excellent (from what I can read in the timestamps), but it is just way too long for me to start watching.

Still dont get how a 100+ employee "media group" can put out over 3 hours of mixed content without timestamps. Dubya tee eff
