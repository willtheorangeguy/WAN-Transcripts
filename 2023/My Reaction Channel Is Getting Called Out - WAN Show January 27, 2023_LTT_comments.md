[2023-01-28T07:43:33Z] Video: My Reaction Channel Is Getting Called Out - WAN Show January 27, 2023 
Welcome to the comments section where you will find all the information you need about Linus's 'L' approach to the DarkViper response video.

In all seriousness, though, I've already apologized to Matt on Twitter. I'll make sure to watch it before next week's show and while I'm at it I'll create some guidelines for how to prepare summaries :/

It was a busy week and we had a new person on the show prep, but that's no excuse. You guys expect and deserve better. We'll address it next Friday. See you there, same bad time, same bad channel 

EDIT: I have watched the video and re-watched the segment of the WAN Show. The notes were honestly pretty much fine (kudos new writer). Our response was also pretty much fine (we never intended to be evil content stealers anyway). The big issue is that we didn't take the time to watch DarkViper's video. It seems like we actually fundamentally agree on the vast majority of this, so my plan is to invite him on the show to clear the air. If he's too frustrated/upset to take me up on it, I understand, but I've reached out.
