[0.00 → 9.12] What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show. We have a great topic lined up for you guys today.
[9.54 → 16.04] Luke and I both got some... I think quality is a strong word, but we got some time in with Starfield already.
[16.22 → 18.04] So we're going to be talking about that a little bit.
[18.04 → 18.76] I got some quality time. Yours is questionable.
[18.84 → 22.06] Yeah, the quality was a little low for me. So we'll be talking about that.
[22.34 → 24.08] We've also got... Quite literally.
[24.40 → 27.08] Oh, right. I guess we should acknowledge the weird thumbnail.
[27.78 → 28.54] Oh, yeah.
[28.54 → 33.08] Intel's quality in Starfield is a little questionable. So we'll be talking about that.
[34.06 → 42.40] In other news, fixity has brought the fight for right to repair to McDonald's, tearing down one of their infamous ice cream machines.
[42.52 → 44.32] So we'll be talking about that. What else we got today?
[44.32 → 49.84] The Legion Go handheld has been announced, and it looks potentially quite interesting.
[50.24 → 54.90] Also, games right now are crazy. That's just going to be a general topic that we have.
[55.16 → 58.50] Starfield, Sea of Stars. Suspiciously similar names.
[58.54 → 60.06] Yeah, but we've got fields and seas.
[60.44 → 60.64] Yep.
[61.20 → 62.96] So next is going to be...
[62.96 → 63.20] Heirs.
[63.42 → 63.66] Heirs.
[63.66 → 63.70] Heirs.
[63.70 → 63.94] Heirs.
[63.94 → 64.16] Heirs.
[64.16 → 64.26] Heirs.
[64.26 → 64.34] Heirs.
[64.34 → 66.92] Don't forget about the Citizen of Star. Oh, we got that one already.
[67.04 → 67.92] Desert of Stars.
[68.18 → 68.48] Yeah.
[69.06 → 70.04] Tundra of Stars.
[70.80 → 72.52] Okay, there are a lot of biomes. Chill.
[73.72 → 74.40] Star chill.
[74.56 → 75.34] Forest of Stars.
[75.86 → 77.32] We're perfect at naming games.
[78.06 → 79.50] What else we got?
[79.96 → 80.84] No, I did two.
[81.40 → 81.76] Good.
[81.94 → 83.38] I actually thought of two this time.
[95.54 → 96.64] Citizens of Stars.
[96.64 → 105.86] The show is brought to you today by Sea sonic.
[106.08 → 106.74] PDF.
[108.86 → 109.80] And it's gone.
[111.08 → 113.00] PDF and kudos.
[113.52 → 113.74] Kudos.
[113.88 → 115.98] Why don't we jump right into the big topic?
[116.12 → 121.24] I mean, who in the game-o-sphere is not amped about Starfield right now?
[121.30 → 122.84] Who in the game-o-sphere is not amped right now?
[122.84 → 127.64] Who is even watching the WAN show right now instead of playing Starfield?
[127.64 → 132.96] I got some comments of people saying like, hey, just checking in, but I can't really keep watching because there's too much dialogue in Starfield.
[133.10 → 133.56] See you later.
[133.62 → 135.04] Can you explain something to me?
[135.16 → 135.34] Yeah.
[135.80 → 136.12] Maybe.
[136.12 → 138.96] How is it that you already have like six hours logged?
[139.40 → 146.14] Because I have personally spent like most of your waking hours with you since the game launched.
[149.00 → 150.64] Can you explain this to me?
[150.86 → 152.68] I was at your house until like six.
[153.06 → 153.36] Uh-huh.
[153.50 → 153.72] Yeah.
[153.72 → 155.30] And then I went home and played until like midnight.
[156.28 → 156.72] I see.
[156.82 → 157.50] And then I went to sleep.
[158.18 → 159.64] And then I saw you this morning.
[159.80 → 160.66] And we played more Starfield.
[160.68 → 161.62] And we played more Starfield.
[161.74 → 162.34] Okay, cool.
[162.34 → 168.60] Why don't we run through what's in our notes here, and then we'll talk a little bit about Luke's experience and also my experience.
[168.76 → 170.16] I got stuck in a ship already.
[170.28 → 171.32] That was actually cool.
[171.44 → 173.22] That took me way longer in Star Citizen.
[173.50 → 173.82] Yes.
[174.28 → 180.20] Bethesda's Starfield is available through early access and is set to come out more generally on Wednesday, September the 6th.
[180.28 → 185.34] Reviews are already out and are generally positive, though some community discourse...
[185.34 → 187.34] Um...
[189.16 → 189.52] Okay.
[189.80 → 190.44] Oh, uh...
[190.44 → 196.90] Has been centred around comparisons to No Man's Sky, Star Citizen, as well as other Bethesda games and hasn't been especially positive.
[197.32 → 197.72] One particular...
[197.72 → 199.40] And like Mass Effect and tons of things.
[199.54 → 205.94] One particular pain point was the fact that players cannot walk the circumference of Starfield's 1,000 planets.
[206.06 → 208.20] How dare they?
[208.20 → 227.44] I mean, you can land anywhere on a planet, but outside pre-established sites like cities, the game mixes procedurally generated and handcrafted elements to create a limited area that you can explore on foot, which by some reports is actually bigger than the entire map of Fallout 4.
[227.44 → 229.44] So, this complaint...
[229.44 → 232.70] I don't care about this literally at all.
[232.92 → 232.96] Spurious?
[233.16 → 233.34] Yeah.
[233.42 → 242.42] If you want to spend actually hours walking in a particular direction finding nothing, like, okay?
[242.92 → 245.86] I think if there's anything that gamers have proven over the years, it's that they will.
[245.96 → 247.08] Someone's going to want to do that.
[247.10 → 247.68] They do want to.
[247.88 → 252.38] But there's very likely, in my opinion, going to be some mod that allows you to do it anyway.
[252.38 → 259.26] Also, you could walk up to a certain point and then, like, just get in your ship and move it and then just keep walking if you wanted.
[259.64 → 262.46] You could circumnavigate a planet by just moving your ship a bunch of times.
[262.58 → 268.12] A slightly more legitimate concern, criticism, concerns the in-game map, particularly in cities.
[268.20 → 269.56] And I have a link here.
[269.92 → 271.74] It apparently looks like this.
[272.48 → 274.62] Oh, that is very unfortunate.
[275.12 → 281.02] I will fully admit the map totally is terrible.
[281.02 → 286.60] I will also, however, say that this is the planet-side map.
[286.78 → 287.04] Yeah.
[287.58 → 293.72] When you're in the space view, solar system view, etc., that's all good.
[294.38 → 298.60] The planet-side terrestrial map is kind of trash.
[299.00 → 301.56] I think someone's probably going to change this at some point.
[304.02 → 305.90] But I don't know.
[306.08 → 307.14] I didn't really use it.
[307.30 → 308.00] So I didn't really care.
[308.00 → 309.04] Can I just...
[309.04 → 312.38] It's one of those things, though, that is just kind of confusing to me.
[312.80 → 313.80] Why is it so bad?
[314.38 → 316.08] Because the Skyrim map was fantastic.
[316.50 → 318.18] Borrowing came out in 2002.
[319.66 → 321.40] I would guess...
[321.40 → 322.46] You've played Borrowing.
[322.54 → 327.84] I have only dropped into it once, and I didn't last very long because I tried to play it after playing Oblivion.
[328.12 → 328.84] Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[328.84 → 329.32] Yeah, anyway.
[329.32 → 333.40] I would guess that the map was actually better than this.
[333.58 → 333.68] Yeah.
[333.94 → 334.90] So how is it...
[334.90 → 338.54] And we saw a lot of stuff like that when we were tinkering around with it this morning.
[339.08 → 346.82] How is it that you can have been making games where you explore and use maps for 20 years and then release a map like that?
[346.88 → 347.62] Like, I just don't really...
[347.62 → 348.46] It had to be intentional.
[348.46 → 350.46] Yeah, I will say...
[351.42 → 356.16] Like, when I landed in whatever the main city is called.
[356.24 → 356.86] What is it called again?
[359.14 → 359.54] Dan?
[360.22 → 360.86] Dan's trying.
[361.10 → 361.84] New Atlantis?
[361.92 → 362.40] New Atlantis.
[362.58 → 373.86] When I landed in New Atlantis, which is like the big primary main city, I was unsure of where to go to find a place that I could sell my firearms to because I was carrying too many firearms.
[373.98 → 374.58] I wanted to sell them.
[374.68 → 375.30] What a problem.
[375.30 → 377.92] So I didn't open my map.
[378.00 → 378.72] I don't know why.
[378.86 → 380.10] I can tell you weren't in America.
[381.38 → 382.94] Actually, it's...
[382.94 → 389.48] The store is in the residential district and I made a joke about how it feels like it's America.
[391.22 → 391.66] Sorry.
[395.48 → 397.58] Anyway, I saw...
[397.58 → 398.54] There was an info kiosk.
[398.60 → 399.38] I didn't open my map.
[399.52 → 400.62] There was an info kiosk.
[400.68 → 402.34] And I was like, oh, I wonder if like this works.
[402.34 → 405.64] And I opened it, and it tells me what thing it's in.
[405.76 → 407.02] Like what area it's in.
[407.52 → 409.18] And I just went to the tram thing.
[409.42 → 410.76] And the tram said I could go there.
[410.86 → 412.52] So I went there, and then I just found it myself.
[412.96 → 414.24] And it felt very intuitive.
[414.36 → 417.08] It felt intuitive to the point where I didn't even really think of opening the map.
[417.74 → 419.10] I was just like, oh, I'm just going to do it this way.
[419.66 → 422.60] So yes, the map is bad and it should be better.
[422.84 → 424.14] And I hope dodders make it better.
[424.28 → 430.26] But I will say that they've done other things in the game that are cool to the point where you don't really need to use it that much.
[430.86 → 433.18] You can also fast travel not using the map.
[433.90 → 435.28] You have this thing called the scanner.
[435.82 → 437.76] And you can bring it up, and it'll show you points of interest.
[437.84 → 441.80] And you can fast travel to those points of interest on foot and in your ship.
[441.80 → 449.98] A lot of people complain about needing to open up, including myself, about needing to open up the map to fast travel when you're in your ship because it feels very non-immersive.
[450.24 → 456.22] But I learned today, I haven't been able to put it into action yet, but I learned today that you don't actually have to do that.
[456.60 → 458.44] You turn on your scanner and then you can warp there.
[458.70 → 459.94] Riley's calling Bethesda simp.
[460.10 → 463.94] That's true, but I think I'm being fairly unbalanced here.
[463.98 → 465.32] I'm saying the map is trash.
[465.50 → 467.34] What I'm also saying is that there are ways around it.
[467.34 → 469.34] Is that you don't really need the map anyway.
[469.46 → 469.82] It's true.
[469.82 → 471.86] The map is trash, though.
[471.98 → 472.60] You are kind of...
[472.60 → 473.98] And the Skyrim map was sick.
[474.06 → 476.68] You are kind of sounding like an apologist right now.
[476.90 → 477.54] For what?
[477.60 → 478.28] I said it's trash.
[478.28 → 479.26] Where's the city map?
[479.28 → 479.48] Yeah.
[479.68 → 480.64] Where's the city map?
[480.70 → 481.16] It's bad!
[481.30 → 482.42] Where's the city map?
[482.44 → 483.12] I never said it's good!
[483.16 → 484.42] Why do you like it so much?
[484.44 → 488.04] The iPhone reception is bad, but if you just held it differently, then it wouldn't be a problem.
[488.04 → 488.76] You're using it wrong.
[491.76 → 495.06] He doesn't like it, but he has nothing.
[495.06 → 495.86] It's because it's fair.
[498.46 → 499.06] All right.
[499.82 → 504.18] I'm just saying, if you are playing, there are ways that you can avoid it because it
[504.18 → 506.68] is so bad that you should probably not use it.
[506.72 → 508.04] Because it's actually like...
[508.04 → 509.10] I thought it was a bug.
[509.58 → 513.18] Someone first sent me that the map was this bad, and I was like, yeah, there's no way.
[513.36 → 517.46] That's got to just be like, it's not loaded in properly, or something's just wrong.
[517.60 → 518.48] I don't really believe it.
[518.48 → 521.28] And then I saw it in the game myself, and I was like, holy crap.
[521.54 → 522.14] They're not kidding.
[522.14 → 526.50] Because again, the solar system map is fantastic.
[528.70 → 530.14] So I don't know.
[530.28 → 531.22] I don't know why it's so bad.
[531.42 → 533.14] Overall, the game seems to be running...
[534.00 → 535.16] Running.
[535.16 → 539.68] On NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards, outside some minor issues.
[539.92 → 543.46] The notes here say, Linus can probably speak to this, having filmed a video today.
[543.52 → 544.30] Yeah, we both can.
[544.38 → 545.32] We were both there.
[545.38 → 546.24] We'll talk about this in a bit.
[546.32 → 553.22] But according to Reddit, on Intel Arc GPUs, most of the time, the game doesn't even launch.
[553.52 → 556.14] And this is a great video from Hugh Splat.
[556.22 → 559.58] I'm not going to show you the whole thing because, you know, fair use, right?
[559.58 → 561.28] I don't want you guys to watch the whole thing.
[561.28 → 562.60] I want you to go check out the video.
[562.70 → 565.08] It has 368 views, but it's amazing.
[565.92 → 568.32] Arc A770, no work.
[569.42 → 570.36] Check this out.
[570.64 → 574.04] It apparently looks like that when it does manage to launch.
[574.26 → 577.24] I'm going to drop the link in the chat so you guys can go check that out.
[577.76 → 581.22] It's only about a 30-second clip, so it's not going to take you very long.
[581.90 → 582.44] Oh, right.
[582.48 → 583.24] The YouTube chat as well.
[583.28 → 584.22] I forgot about YouTube chat.
[584.28 → 584.92] Sorry, YouTube chat.
[586.78 → 588.40] I remember you.
[588.40 → 593.08] I was trying to think of, like, you know, what you would say to your forgotten child.
[594.20 → 596.92] It's just, um, so that they're not forgotten.
[597.04 → 598.22] I was just, I was getting milk.
[598.44 → 599.08] I remember, yeah.
[599.40 → 601.68] And cigarettes from the corner store.
[602.02 → 607.54] Uh, anywho, Intel has acknowledged the issue on Twitter, says that they are working to improve
[607.54 → 609.76] the experience for the game's general release next week.
[609.76 → 615.24] And meanwhile, AMD released their Starfield-optimized driver on October 31st, while NVIDIA released
[615.24 → 619.26] their driver a week earlier on August 22nd.
[619.30 → 619.98] Did I say October?
[620.38 → 621.14] Did I say October?
[621.30 → 621.94] You know, it doesn't matter.
[622.10 → 622.34] I think you might have.
[622.58 → 628.28] I'll give us a little spoiler alert here, too, because I've been retesting the 7900 XTX for
[628.28 → 631.22] the AMD video because I'm trying to get, like, more recent testing.
[631.80 → 634.42] And I launched the game, and it crashed pretty quickly.
[634.42 → 636.50] And I was like, oh, no.
[636.74 → 638.86] And then realized that I didn't have the day one driver.
[639.32 → 640.50] Got the day one driver.
[641.16 → 642.66] Perfect after that.
[643.04 → 645.52] Zero performance issues, zero crashes, no problems.
[645.70 → 646.92] So it was a very good experience.
[647.22 → 648.56] And it's on me for not updating.
[648.84 → 650.24] So, not their problem.
[651.06 → 654.60] Now, we tried three different configurations today.
[655.18 → 663.26] Aside from Luke's at-home config with the 7900 XT, we tried a 5700, so Radeon 5700,
[663.26 → 671.40] which happens to be the minimum spec that Bethesda advertises as what can have, I guess,
[671.64 → 674.84] a suitably adequate experience running the game.
[674.96 → 676.34] You can play the game this way.
[676.36 → 680.46] I've never really understood what minimum spec means.
[680.48 → 684.34] Because you can always launch it with slightly more minimum than what the minimum spec is.
[684.34 → 684.60] Yeah.
[685.10 → 687.10] Anyway, so we tried that.
[687.10 → 694.18] We tried their recommended spec, which is an RTX 2080 non-super, if I recall correctly.
[694.72 → 699.30] And then we also got just a ballin' out, absolutely everything, top-of-the-line config.
[700.02 → 706.38] And I think, man, I don't want to say too much, because it's a good video.
[706.54 → 707.50] It's worth watching.
[707.50 → 715.50] We encountered a ton of sort of interesting behaviour, both in terms of, like, graphical anomalies,
[716.42 → 721.42] or, you know, things that we can discuss, and in terms of just, like, general game behaviour.
[721.54 → 728.02] And there's an interesting discussion in it about the current state of, like, PC graphics options.
[728.02 → 733.72] Because it's, we're in an interesting spot, because there are a lot of graphics options settings,
[733.94 → 737.52] which, when enabled, enable a bunch of automated stuff.
[738.06 → 738.24] Yeah.
[738.36 → 739.02] And it's like...
[739.02 → 739.82] It's a black box.
[739.94 → 741.46] I don't really know what's happening.
[742.10 → 742.50] Exactly.
[742.74 → 743.14] So it's...
[743.14 → 744.02] You might get...
[745.22 → 746.96] Let's put it this way.
[747.86 → 756.20] The minimum config and the recommended config, just out of the box, ran at almost the same FPS.
[758.02 → 764.96] However, it was very noticeable to the eye that one of them looked better than the other.
[765.58 → 770.74] But we had no way of knowing exactly what settings in the background...
[770.74 → 774.46] To be clear, when he's talking minimum recommended config, he means the hardware config.
[774.58 → 776.84] The settings are the same on both in this scenario.
[777.78 → 779.04] No, not necessarily.
[779.42 → 779.78] But...
[779.78 → 780.60] So we did that.
[780.98 → 782.24] We did the same settings on both.
[782.24 → 782.78] Oh, that's true. We did do that. Yes.
[782.78 → 787.96] And it was graphically better on the higher end one with very similar frame rates.
[788.30 → 788.54] Yes.
[790.16 → 790.64] Interesting.
[790.80 → 798.12] So the reason for that is there's so much automatic fidelity tuning going on in the game...
[798.12 → 799.00] If you turn on certain settings.
[799.12 → 800.90] You can't tell necessarily...
[800.90 → 802.64] And those are settings that are enabled by default.
[802.72 → 803.88] And you probably should turn on.
[804.18 → 808.34] That you can't tell exactly what you're running at.
[808.34 → 812.14] Like, it doesn't have a drop-down for texture quality.
[815.04 → 815.52] What?
[815.92 → 816.18] Yeah.
[816.46 → 817.40] When's the last time...
[817.40 → 821.34] I mean, I shouldn't even ask this because there are a lot of console ports that are...
[821.34 → 822.48] There's going to be an example right away.
[822.48 → 824.30] Yeah, there's going to be an example right away.
[824.44 → 826.06] But my point is...
[826.06 → 826.34] Yesterday.
[826.66 → 833.60] When's the last time that we should have seen a PC game that doesn't have a texture quality slider?
[834.08 → 834.36] Yeah.
[835.08 → 835.80] It's weird.
[835.80 → 838.22] How is that even remotely acceptable?
[838.50 → 841.62] There's already dodders fixing some of that stuff.
[841.74 → 845.40] Like, there's dodders in Starfield that have added FOV control.
[846.30 → 849.14] Because did you notice there isn't an FOV slider option?
[849.40 → 850.58] I didn't even notice that.
[851.12 → 853.96] Interesting to have a first-person game with no FOV slider.
[854.20 → 855.92] Least of my concerns, sir.
[856.34 → 856.90] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[856.90 → 859.68] When I saw the fact that there's no texture slider...
[859.68 → 861.48] I don't even think we should talk about the other one.
[861.86 → 862.06] What?
[862.40 → 862.86] Draw distance?
[863.48 → 863.88] No.
[864.04 → 865.76] There's no draw distance slider!
[865.88 → 870.12] The one thing that you can't change that we were enraged about.
[870.78 → 871.00] Sure.
[871.00 → 872.40] I feel like that should be a tidbit for the video.
[872.48 → 872.98] No, no.
[873.10 → 873.82] Let's talk about...
[873.82 → 875.00] There's so much in the video.
[875.10 → 875.28] Okay.
[875.28 → 880.18] You can't set a non-native resolution.
[880.50 → 882.28] So if you have a 4K monitor...
[882.28 → 884.22] This is a very hard-to-run game.
[884.28 → 885.74] If you have a 4K monitor, and you're like,
[885.82 → 887.94] I run this game in 1440p...
[887.94 → 888.40] Or 1080.
[888.70 → 893.52] You have to do resolution percentage, whatever it's called.
[893.66 → 894.02] Scaling.
[894.18 → 894.50] Scaling?
[894.62 → 894.78] Yeah.
[894.78 → 895.94] You have to do resolution scaling.
[895.94 → 900.28] But when you do that, the other settings are going to interact differently.
[901.36 → 908.34] So we actually got a very different experience instead of doing a resolution scaling by changing our monitor's resolution,
[908.94 → 914.22] setting it to native, cranking resolution scaling to 100%, and then interacting with other options.
[914.32 → 915.58] It was actually notably different.
[915.72 → 917.04] Hold on. I should clarify that a little bit.
[917.30 → 919.94] So by setting it to a non-native desktop resolution.
[920.84 → 922.92] So we've got a 4K TV.
[922.92 → 929.10] If we run it at 4K, but then set the resolution scaling to 50%, which is the minimum,
[929.34 → 931.50] that's as low as the slider in-game goes.
[931.56 → 932.94] Remember, we don't have any mods installed.
[933.12 → 933.76] We're not...
[933.76 → 937.64] You know, we were experiencing it as a gamer would experience it.
[937.68 → 941.78] We're not running into, you know, config files or anything like that and manually typing in values.
[941.88 → 944.86] We're just using it as it's meant to be used.
[945.14 → 950.80] So 50% is the lowest you can go, meaning that you are rendering at 1080p,
[950.80 → 955.82] and then, but like FSR is enabled, so maybe...
[955.82 → 962.72] Like, you actually have no idea what resolution, like what pixel count your GPU is trying to push.
[962.92 → 969.80] And then, sorry, what Luke was saying was we tried changing the desktop resolution to 1080p.
[969.98 → 972.44] So that's not the native resolution of the panel.
[972.44 → 980.10] Now we go into the game, and all of a sudden, we can turn it down to 50% again, which would be 540p.
[980.80 → 990.44] Except that depending on what desktop resolution you're running, except that no matter what desktop resolution you're running at,
[990.44 → 1001.24] when you just go too low, medium, and high, it just moves that slider to, what was it, like 62%, 50%, or 75%.
[1001.24 → 1003.60] It actually, even on ultra, never goes to 100%.
[1003.60 → 1006.14] We didn't even mention that in the video, but that blew my mind.
[1006.14 → 1007.16] I think we pointed it out.
[1007.28 → 1008.92] I don't know if it was a major beat, but we pointed it out.
[1008.92 → 1010.30] It never defaults to 100%.
[1010.30 → 1020.34] So what that means is it's setting this overall level of detail the same, regardless of what pixel count your display is running at.
[1021.10 → 1024.38] How is that even possible that they overlooked that?
[1024.44 → 1025.68] I don't understand it.
[1026.00 → 1026.64] It's kind of wild.
[1026.74 → 1027.84] You also can't full screen.
[1028.58 → 1040.14] So if you're at 1080p for your desktop resolution, and you put it at low, it's going to render at 50% of 1080p with all low details.
[1040.70 → 1049.44] If you have a 4K monitor, okay, and you set it to low, you are going to render at 1080p all low details.
[1050.46 → 1050.98] Whoops.
[1055.28 → 1056.98] Those are not the same low.
[1057.18 → 1057.64] It's weird.
[1059.12 → 1059.64] Yeah.
[1059.78 → 1060.64] It's honestly really weird.
[1061.28 → 1067.20] The whole, like, only working in windowed full screen, though, and having to use, like, resolution scaling, I know that's not a new thing.
[1067.26 → 1068.56] That's not unique to this game.
[1068.82 → 1069.94] It's just...
[1069.94 → 1072.52] The implementation is bank.
[1072.66 → 1075.68] And it's bad, and I hate it, but that's a separate thing.
[1075.82 → 1077.58] Like, Halo Infinite has the same thing, too.
[1077.60 → 1079.28] You can't just run an exclusive full screen mode.
[1079.28 → 1087.94] But the implementation in Starfield and the way that the presets interact with it is really, terrible.
[1087.94 → 1089.66] Because people have the same hardware.
[1090.50 → 1093.42] They're going to set it at the same thing in-game.
[1093.42 → 1101.56] And then, depending on what monitor they have, them and their friend might have very, very different gameplay experiences.
[1102.48 → 1103.52] That's bad.
[1103.52 → 1120.66] Not being able to just set an exact pixel count that you are rendering at, and then an exact target pixel count that you are trying to upscale to means that you just have no idea what's going on inside the black box of this engine.
[1120.66 → 1124.66] Just wild, man.
[1124.66 → 1127.18] Definitely some fun bugs.
[1127.18 → 1130.30] I really like the one where dead guys stand like this.
[1130.30 → 1130.96] Oh, yeah.
[1131.86 → 1133.68] It holsters their weapon, so they actually...
[1133.68 → 1134.40] There is nothing here.
[1134.50 → 1134.74] So that...
[1134.74 → 1135.08] No, no, no.
[1135.24 → 1136.12] Their hands are up.
[1136.14 → 1136.64] Oh, yeah, right.
[1136.72 → 1136.82] Okay.
[1136.82 → 1139.74] But their weapon just goes in their holster, and they stand there, and they're bootable.
[1140.04 → 1141.18] But they just keep doing this.
[1141.44 → 1145.20] So you're looking around, and you keep getting jump-scared by this thing.
[1145.20 → 1146.32] By this thing.
[1146.44 → 1147.98] I waste a ton of ammo on them.
[1148.56 → 1151.26] Because every time I'll come around the corner, I'll be like, ah, and I shoot.
[1151.32 → 1152.04] And I'm like, ah, crap.
[1153.12 → 1154.88] Yeah, but I mean, that might be a think.
[1154.96 → 1156.86] You couldn't even recognize friendlies from enemies.
[1157.12 → 1158.38] Oh, my goodness.
[1158.86 → 1160.74] I was roasting him for that, and then I did it, too.
[1164.26 → 1165.60] It's a very gray-brown.
[1165.74 → 1166.20] I have an excuse.
[1166.32 → 1166.90] My eyes are bad.
[1168.54 → 1170.36] I mean, I know this is true.
[1170.62 → 1170.80] Yeah.
[1171.06 → 1171.42] Yeah.
[1171.84 → 1172.80] I mean, I guess so.
[1172.80 → 1175.62] He was roasting the game for being very, like, shades of gray and brown.
[1175.90 → 1179.02] But we were on a moon, so it's like, I don't know.
[1179.90 → 1180.12] Yeah.
[1180.30 → 1181.58] I've been on colourful planets.
[1181.92 → 1188.76] There are also, and again, this is defending Bethesda, but there's reshape mods already out.
[1189.12 → 1190.64] There's, like, multiple of them.
[1190.76 → 1192.46] Zero Point and Float Plane says I had the opposite.
[1192.70 → 1195.96] Some miner was lying dead on the floor, but had his eyes open and was talking.
[1197.82 → 1198.88] I think that's worse.
[1199.00 → 1199.18] Yeah.
[1199.34 → 1200.08] That's a lot worse.
[1201.20 → 1201.80] Oh, boy.
[1201.80 → 1206.94] I mean, zombies are normalized enough in games that it's like, I don't mind the living dead,
[1207.02 → 1207.88] but the dead living.
[1208.62 → 1210.12] Space zombies are worse.
[1210.22 → 1210.98] That's uncomfortable.
[1212.02 → 1212.30] Yeah.
[1212.86 → 1213.12] Yeah.
[1213.28 → 1214.62] Are we talking about Star Citizen?
[1214.80 → 1215.08] No.
[1215.84 → 1216.10] No.
[1216.18 → 1216.78] No, we're not.
[1217.02 → 1221.94] No, but in a weird way, this made me appreciate Star Citizen a little bit more.
[1222.90 → 1223.18] Really?
[1223.18 → 1224.18] Because...
[1224.18 → 1225.00] That is...
[1225.00 → 1231.76] For a game that you just spent probably a solid, I don't know, 75% of the pre-show and, like,
[1231.82 → 1235.10] half of this show being positive about, that is a really mean thing to say.
[1235.12 → 1235.14] Oh, no.
[1235.14 → 1236.96] See, we haven't had the opportunities.
[1237.20 → 1239.78] I have a lot of negative things I can say about Starfield.
[1239.78 → 1243.22] Um, I've talked to you, but I hate the crouching.
[1243.68 → 1245.42] And you pointed out that, like, maybe it's a little more realistic.
[1245.62 → 1246.26] I don't care.
[1246.66 → 1246.80] Yeah.
[1246.80 → 1247.74] It feels like junk.
[1248.16 → 1248.52] Okay.
[1248.86 → 1249.26] Uh...
[1249.26 → 1250.44] It feels very bad to me.
[1250.66 → 1251.04] Yeah.
[1251.08 → 1253.32] It's not very, like, Quaker.
[1253.58 → 1253.92] You know?
[1254.06 → 1260.16] Like, it's not, like, press control, and they're just like, I am faster than gravity.
[1260.16 → 1260.66] You know?
[1260.76 → 1262.06] Like, it's not like that.
[1262.18 → 1265.18] Like, it's, like, press, you know?
[1265.32 → 1268.50] Like, it takes them a split second to get down.
[1268.64 → 1269.86] But, like, here's my...
[1269.86 → 1270.40] You played Markov.
[1270.42 → 1271.12] Here's my issue.
[1271.14 → 1271.80] How is this a problem for you?
[1272.02 → 1273.86] It takes, like, eight minutes to get to prone.
[1274.86 → 1277.12] It actually feels more responsive in Markov.
[1277.40 → 1281.02] One of the things in Markov that I would say is it initiates faster.
[1281.24 → 1286.22] And one of my big problems is if I'm in a firefight, and I'm, like, I'm getting shot at.
[1286.54 → 1288.68] I need to be behind this physical cover.
[1288.68 → 1290.82] My character's like, oh, get to it.
[1290.94 → 1292.06] Like, no, dude.
[1292.74 → 1293.66] Get down.
[1294.20 → 1298.88] And there's maybe some argument for, like, crouching when you're actively moving, taking longer.
[1299.10 → 1302.48] And I think Markov does do that now that they have the momentum system in place.
[1303.52 → 1305.10] But it just...
[1305.10 → 1307.82] It feels really, really clunky.
[1308.12 → 1308.90] And I don't...
[1308.90 → 1309.70] I don't like it.
[1309.84 → 1314.46] I 100% think this is just a modern gaming thing, and you're going to have to deal with it.
[1314.56 → 1317.04] Here's something that isn't a modern gaming thing.
[1317.04 → 1319.24] Is the sheer volume of loading screens.
[1319.48 → 1323.02] And the places that the loading screens even happen in...
[1323.02 → 1326.28] Like, there were the firearms store, like I mentioned earlier.
[1326.70 → 1331.02] It's a very, very small shop with one shopkeeper.
[1331.36 → 1333.28] You have to loading screen in and loading screen out.
[1334.08 → 1336.14] It loads this enormous city around it.
[1336.46 → 1337.76] Just let me open the door.
[1338.20 → 1339.40] Don't put a loading screen.
[1339.72 → 1340.50] What are we doing?
[1340.90 → 1341.90] Yeah, I mean...
[1341.90 → 1343.58] Why do you have to loading screen into your ship?
[1343.66 → 1344.96] The inside of the ship is tiny.
[1345.84 → 1354.44] Remember when we all watched that PlayStation 5 showcase where they talked about, you know,
[1354.56 → 1359.54] new generation, streaming data off of high-speed SSDs and all that stuff.
[1359.54 → 1363.30] I know that that's a Sony thing.
[1363.68 → 1368.74] And architecturally, they are probably ahead of what Microsoft is doing on the Xbox right now.
[1368.84 → 1380.20] But the sheer speed of the SSDs is different, but not so different that I would imagine that what you're talking about should be a problem.
[1380.20 → 1384.20] As you get close to something, I don't...
[1384.20 → 1388.20] I don't actually understand why it couldn't start to...
[1388.94 → 1389.18] Yeah.
[1389.64 → 1391.10] Start to grab those assets.
[1391.28 → 1392.56] And some people are backing me up.
[1392.62 → 1394.02] Night Paws in Flow plane Chat said,
[1394.12 → 1395.36] Crouch and Flashlight.
[1395.44 → 1396.26] I noticed this too.
[1396.52 → 1398.76] Both make me feel like your character has severe arthritis.
[1399.16 → 1404.74] There's already mods that reduce the input latency when you go to carry objects in-game.
[1405.12 → 1407.96] So if you go to, like, I'm picking this up and I want to move it and put it somewhere else,
[1407.96 → 1413.30] there are already mods that reduce the input latency on that because it's, like, super high for, like, no real reason.
[1414.14 → 1419.80] There's a bunch of weird, sluggish controls where you go to do something, you press the button,
[1419.98 → 1424.66] there's a noticeable amount of time that goes by for, like, no reason, and then it starts to happen.
[1424.78 → 1425.96] It's just like, I'm just...
[1426.48 → 1428.22] It doesn't make it more immersive for me.
[1428.26 → 1428.90] It doesn't make it better.
[1429.00 → 1429.42] I hate it.
[1429.48 → 1430.56] I wonder if part of it...
[1430.56 → 1431.82] I'm excited for mods to solve that.
[1431.82 → 1437.12] I wonder if part of it is that people are generally used to running games at really high frame rates.
[1437.96 → 1440.62] And Starfield does not.
[1441.64 → 1449.62] Like, both of the recommended systems, they were clearly, with the recommended settings on these recommended configs,
[1450.00 → 1452.30] clearly targeting 30 frames per second.
[1452.30 → 1454.44] Like, 28...
[1454.44 → 1461.20] 26 to 28 1% lows, 30 to 33 average kind of thing.
[1461.20 → 1468.96] And I do wonder if a lot of PC gamers in particular are playing this 30 FPS game and kind of going,
[1470.44 → 1476.44] man, it feels like there's an extra, like, 17 milliseconds on top of everything I'm trying to do.
[1476.70 → 1480.14] Now, that doesn't explain your issue with the crouch or the flashlight.
[1480.36 → 1480.84] Because it's not everything.
[1480.84 → 1483.08] And I think that that's probably part of it.
[1483.18 → 1491.42] But I do wonder if these things are compounding a little bit and making it feel more worker than it actually is.
[1491.48 → 1491.86] Potentially.
[1492.62 → 1496.10] Because we talked about this a little bit when we were at the shoot.
[1496.20 → 1497.30] It's not part of the video.
[1497.56 → 1504.92] But we were talking about how this year it feels like there's been huge game after huge game.
[1504.92 → 1506.22] Oh, it's been amazing.
[1506.28 → 1507.58] And it's just, like, kind of happening.
[1507.82 → 1509.34] And we had some different theories.
[1509.34 → 1511.66] I think one of the theories was...
[1511.66 → 1512.92] I said COVID games.
[1512.94 → 1513.84] COVID era games, yeah.
[1514.10 → 1523.70] And then one of the other theories was, you know, maybe this is just what the development cycle looks like for a new generation console now.
[1523.98 → 1524.28] Like...
[1524.28 → 1525.06] I think that's a good one.
[1525.10 → 1529.42] I think people have talked a lot about how the Xbox has lost this generation.
[1530.44 → 1531.42] The PlayStation 5.
[1531.54 → 1532.74] You ran away with it.
[1532.88 → 1533.56] Whatever else.
[1533.90 → 1537.34] But what I kind of wonder is if...
[1537.34 → 1539.16] Forget about the hardware.
[1539.34 → 1555.70] On the software side, Sony just did a way, way better job of filling up the queue with games that were, if not next-gen, at least post-last-gen enough that they could make the PlayStation 5 hard...
[1555.70 → 1566.54] Give the PlayStation 5 hardware enough of a library of next-gen content that it just seems like the obvious winner today.
[1566.66 → 1567.32] But if it's not...
[1567.32 → 1567.94] Maybe not over.
[1568.42 → 1571.02] Something that I would argue is I don't think it's...
[1571.02 → 1573.18] It's the flood coming for the Xbox.
[1574.30 → 1576.08] I don't know about that.
[1576.08 → 1579.64] I think my argument is more that I actually...
[1579.64 → 1581.96] Now that I think about it more, I don't think it's a console generation thing.
[1582.16 → 1584.68] Because what I'm noticing is game quality.
[1585.58 → 1587.30] And like a game that I'm going to...
[1587.30 → 1595.24] Games that I'm going to include personally for this like, hey, games have been amazing lately, are like Dave the Diver and Sea of Stars.
[1595.24 → 1600.02] Which have nothing to do with fantastic next-gen hardware.
[1601.34 → 1612.24] I also think like the reasons why I just adore Baldur's Gate 3, which is just a stunningly amazing game, have nothing to do with the...
[1612.24 → 1618.24] Like graphically, I think it's very similar to Divinity Original Sin 2, which is the previous game that they made.
[1618.32 → 1619.28] I think it's the same engine.
[1619.40 → 1620.42] I think it's a lot of the same stuff.
[1620.58 → 1622.50] I don't think that's because of console generation.
[1624.08 → 1628.92] Starfield, for how hard it is to run, not a particularly amazing looking game.
[1630.32 → 1632.90] Let me clarify my console generation point, though.
[1633.06 → 1633.28] Okay.
[1633.34 → 1636.62] Because I don't necessarily mean that those games...
[1636.62 → 1638.44] It's kind of like what I was saying with the PlayStation thing.
[1638.44 → 1643.34] I don't necessarily mean that those games are taking full advantage of this console generation.
[1643.54 → 1651.82] What I'm saying is that what I suspect is that the development cycle for these games couldn't start until the development kits hit.
[1652.32 → 1653.78] For this generation of consoles.
[1653.96 → 1655.18] And we're at the point now where...
[1655.18 → 1656.28] What was the budget for Starfield?
[1656.36 → 1661.14] I think I saw people throwing around the $600 million number like earlier in the chat.
[1661.30 → 1664.22] That is the only citation I have for that.
[1664.30 → 1667.56] But I guarantee you it was many, many millions of dollars.
[1667.56 → 1673.72] Final estimate based on some forum post on NeoGAF is $400 million.
[1673.84 → 1674.04] Okay.
[1674.48 → 1675.30] And yeah.
[1675.44 → 1680.84] So the point is many, many millions of dollars.
[1681.12 → 1688.74] And you were talking about how even playing the game, there are moments where you can clearly see that they worked on this asset like three years ago.
[1688.80 → 1690.00] It really feels like that.
[1690.06 → 1695.44] In my experience, I've seen the fidelity and quality of different assets are surprisingly different across the board.
[1695.46 → 1696.60] So that's going to be a number of things.
[1696.60 → 1699.32] That's going to be you're going to have very different teams working on things.
[1699.32 → 1702.84] And they could be working on them at very, very different times.
[1702.84 → 1713.50] And so we know, okay, yeah, they've obviously been working on this game since around the time the Xbox Series X would have been beginning its life cycle.
[1713.50 → 1730.56] And so I do wonder if it's just that the games that are getting the time, whether that goes into more graphical fidelity or whether it goes into, you know, I'm not going to say something like a Dave the Diver probably has anything to do with this, with this sort of this cycle here.
[1730.56 → 1735.36] But I do think that's probably, you know what, it's probably a combination of a lot of factors.
[1735.58 → 1737.86] It's probably partly the generational cycle.
[1737.98 → 1745.86] It's probably partly just the like, you know, COVID return to productivity boom, you know, projects kind of got stalled for a little bit.
[1745.86 → 1754.06] And maybe we're seeing like, and, you know, maybe it was even just, you know, oh, everything got kind of disrupted, and we had some kind of cool ideas.
[1754.06 → 1755.44] Oh, I'm not talking about it being disrupted.
[1755.96 → 1761.46] I mean, like, like there 's's certain, especially online continuous service games.
[1761.46 → 1773.02] We saw quality increases from COVID era, like, like in during COVID era, because these are games that have to roll out constant content, like constantly.
[1773.68 → 1777.78] I think some of the work from home stuff that happened in the gaming industry was like super beneficial.
[1778.04 → 1782.36] I'm sure it was also super negative for certain companies that like didn't manage it well or whatever.
[1782.54 → 1784.10] I'm not I'm not saying across the board.
[1784.16 → 1785.08] It's good to be very clear.
[1785.26 → 1788.16] Yeah, there's a bit there are some examples where it's worked really well.
[1788.16 → 1794.44] If you are 100% for work from home, or you are 100% against work from home, you're wrong.
[1794.54 → 1795.62] I think there are flaws with those.
[1795.86 → 1799.94] Yeah, there's its the world is almost never black and white.
[1801.34 → 1804.34] And it's it can be it can be really, perfect.
[1804.60 → 1806.98] And it can also be really, terrible.
[1807.22 → 1809.16] Here 's's another I'm jumping off this topic.
[1809.28 → 1811.08] Here's another criticism that I would have for Starfield.
[1811.32 → 1811.52] Yeah.
[1813.00 → 1815.30] One of my favourite things about EVE Online.
[1815.58 → 1817.16] When did EVE Online come out?
[1817.16 → 1820.02] Did EVE Online come out?
[1820.72 → 1822.26] May 6, 2003.
[1823.10 → 1830.46] A space game made on May 6, 2003, in my strong opinion, has drastically better travel mechanics than Starfield.
[1831.86 → 1833.46] When you jump.
[1834.02 → 1836.44] They've been working on that game since 2003.
[1836.44 → 1836.74] No.
[1837.08 → 1838.38] When it launched.
[1838.52 → 1838.80] Okay.
[1838.96 → 1839.26] All right.
[1839.62 → 1840.76] Because it hasn't changed.
[1840.76 → 1846.76] When you jump, if you're jumping to a gate in EVE, your ship aligns.
[1846.76 → 1850.44] This part isn't that important, but it aligns.
[1850.44 → 1852.12] It points at the things it needs to jump to.
[1852.12 → 1855.80] And then it is like kind of starts jumping.
[1855.80 → 1863.90] And then depending on how far away the thing is, you have to sit and warp, and you actually physically move from location to location.
[1864.04 → 1864.14] Right.
[1864.56 → 1866.96] In Starfield, it's just an animation, and then you're done.
[1866.96 → 1874.58] That doesn't translate a sense of distance or effort or time or anything like that.
[1874.64 → 1876.20] And I understand there are different explanations.
[1877.00 → 1883.06] In EVE, you're going up to an extremely high speed and then travelling the whole way.
[1883.40 → 1885.78] In this one, maybe I haven't read all the lore yet.
[1885.84 → 1888.64] Maybe they're doing like, oh, we're folding space or something like that.
[1888.70 → 1890.30] So there is no actual time aspect.
[1890.30 → 1895.64] Also in EVE, when you're in that warp, you can actually get pulled out of it midway through.
[1896.26 → 1896.44] Right.
[1896.72 → 1903.50] Some of the more advanced stuff, you want to be going to special midway points through a solar system instead of gate to gate.
[1903.66 → 1908.50] Because people hide in that traditional warp highway, and they can pull you out right in the middle.
[1908.84 → 1908.96] Yeah.
[1908.96 → 1910.86] They can put a bubble that disrupts warp along the way.
[1911.10 → 1911.16] Exactly.
[1911.36 → 1913.10] But again, this mechanic might work differently.
[1913.18 → 1914.52] It might be folding space or whatever.
[1915.06 → 1918.98] But if it does that, I feel like they should translate it differently.
[1918.98 → 1922.20] Just making it an animation, a loading screen effectively.
[1922.82 → 1923.10] Yeah.
[1923.62 → 1924.06] Feels.
[1924.46 → 1925.54] It's immersion breaking.
[1925.74 → 1926.04] Yes.
[1926.74 → 1932.60] By the way, I think float plane chat is trying to interpret things that we say as uncharitably as possible now.
[1932.80 → 1933.16] Oh boy.
[1933.38 → 1935.48] COVID was the best thing to happen to gaming ever.
[1935.98 → 1938.78] Luke, LaFriendurne, 2023-09-01.
[1938.78 → 1939.54] No, no.
[1939.82 → 1942.00] There are some games where I think it benefited the game.
[1943.68 → 1944.98] Oh, there it is.
[1945.12 → 1945.96] There it is, you guys.
[1946.00 → 1946.44] You heard it again.
[1946.94 → 1947.84] That's all I'm saying.
[1947.84 → 1949.50] There are some games I think it benefited the game.
[1949.62 → 1957.34] I also have a weird theory that it has to do with if the development studio for this game was in a city where people have to commute for extremely long.
[1957.34 → 1959.50] Luke 2023, the blood sacrifice was worth it.
[1959.50 → 1960.04] Extremely long.
[1960.04 → 1961.36] So that I could get better games.
[1963.84 → 1964.62] Oh God.
[1964.74 → 1965.58] No, I'm not saying that.
[1965.58 → 1972.08] If people had to commute for very, very long periods of time to get into like a very densely populated city to get to their office.
[1972.20 → 1975.90] So now they're not burning three hours a day, four hours a day.
[1976.02 → 1981.80] I know someone who worked at a game development studio that had to commute over an hour to get in and out both directions.
[1981.80 → 1983.42] So they're commuting for more than two hours a day.
[1983.42 → 1987.62] If you take that out of their day, they might have more creative energy.
[1987.80 → 1992.58] Can we talk about how I, this is just something that I've never understood.
[1993.08 → 2002.76] I know you and I, I think you and I have probably talked about this at the, at the earliest point, like as much as probably like 13, 14 years ago.
[2002.76 → 2008.84] Uh, I think I was ranting about hockey games, and I was trying to figure out.
[2008.96 → 2011.62] We've had, we've had rant conversations about hockey games for sure.
[2011.70 → 2011.92] Yeah.
[2012.02 → 2012.42] Yeah.
[2012.42 → 2012.62] Yeah.
[2012.68 → 2013.42] But we're Canadian.
[2013.62 → 2015.04] So basically it's a given, right?
[2015.56 → 2030.46] Um, I was trying to figure out why they keep trying to pack stadiums and like major venues into downtown Vancouver, which if you look at a map, the downtown area of Vancouver is almost an island.
[2030.64 → 2031.84] It's not an island.
[2031.84 → 2039.64] It's more of like a peninsula, but it's this tiny, tiny little space with very few points of ingress.
[2040.14 → 2044.98] And so anytime there's any kind of event, I'm glad Taylor Swift isn't coming.
[2045.60 → 2046.36] Oh boy.
[2047.46 → 2049.96] Now I've gotten myself into real trouble.
[2050.28 → 2051.50] COVID was good for gaming.
[2051.88 → 2052.80] I hate Taylor Swift.
[2052.92 → 2053.20] Yeah.
[2053.56 → 2054.62] And we're done.
[2054.82 → 2055.28] See you later.
[2056.84 → 2057.86] Good night, everyone.
[2058.04 → 2058.66] Oh boy.
[2058.66 → 2061.82] Um, because every,
[2061.84 → 2069.78] every time a major event takes place in Vancouver, it's impossible to get in or out for a solid, like six hours.
[2070.24 → 2075.12] And, um, and so I remember talking to you, I was like, why are we doing this?
[2075.88 → 2084.86] Why don't we just put the, put the arena in a suburb where they can just have a giant parking lot where it doesn't cost $40 to park or whatever else.
[2084.86 → 2087.22] And it, and it, and it is like, it doesn't matter.
[2087.36 → 2092.80] And it also happens to be just as long of a, of a trend.
[2092.80 → 2097.68] Like it's just as connected to transit as the downtown core, but we keep doing this.
[2097.68 → 2115.50] And I remember when we first started LMG, I got some advice from someone whose advice I respect a lot in general, but in this case, I think they were just completely wrong where they basically said, yeah, you know, if you're going to be taken seriously, you need to have an office downtown, like a studio downtown.
[2115.50 → 2117.58] I'm like, why?
[2117.80 → 2118.06] Yeah.
[2118.46 → 2119.64] That doesn't make any sense.
[2119.90 → 2121.56] We upload videos to the internet.
[2122.04 → 2123.86] I could have a studio in a barn.
[2124.20 → 2128.76] And as long as it was decorated kind of nicely, you guys might even like it better.
[2129.20 → 2131.44] Look at the way people talk about missing the kitchen.
[2131.96 → 2135.22] Isn't Mr. P's stuff like far away from downtown centres?
[2135.40 → 2135.70] Oh yeah.
[2135.94 → 2136.16] Yeah.
[2136.60 → 2136.92] Oh yeah.
[2137.06 → 2138.10] No one judges that.
[2138.22 → 2138.64] Mind you.
[2138.66 → 2139.00] I don't think.
[2139.10 → 2140.04] There are challenges.
[2140.66 → 2144.88] Like there's a lot of people who just simply do not want to live outside a city.
[2145.68 → 2148.10] And there's also people that don't want to live in a city.
[2148.70 → 2149.86] So like, I don't know.
[2150.24 → 2150.46] Yeah.
[2150.46 → 2153.64] So it's, it's always going to be a it's always going to be a blade that cuts both ways, right?
[2153.64 → 2154.06] Like it's.
[2154.16 → 2155.92] I'd prefer to not live in a city personally.
[2156.22 → 2156.44] Yeah.
[2156.46 → 2159.48] But you are, um, how do I put this?
[2159.74 → 2162.42] Um, pragmatic to a fault.
[2164.72 → 2167.20] If it costs the same, I don't think I would want to live in a city.
[2167.36 → 2168.30] I'll word it that way.
[2168.70 → 2169.88] Uh, it doesn't cost the same.
[2169.92 → 2171.04] It costs more to live in the city.
[2171.04 → 2174.74] No, but what I'm saying is like, come on.
[2175.00 → 2176.30] He's just trying to bother me.
[2177.40 → 2180.26] It's basically all I've done since the pre-show started.
[2181.70 → 2184.98] It's been kind of, it's been kind of a long week.
[2185.14 → 2186.56] I was supposed to be off.
[2186.68 → 2190.56] I was actually supposed to be off last week too, but I was supposed to be, I was supposed
[2190.56 → 2194.80] to be off this week and I managed to get 1.25 days off.
[2195.32 → 2200.92] Um, and the days that I did work, which was most of them were incredibly intense.
[2200.92 → 2202.82] We've got a lot of new stuff going on.
[2202.90 → 2207.42] We've got a lot of, uh, we've got a lot of pressure from the community rightly to make
[2207.42 → 2209.54] sure that, you know, everything is, everything's polished.
[2209.54 → 2210.94] Everything's, you know, awesome.
[2211.46 → 2216.14] Um, and so there's just been, there's been a lot, there's been a lot going on, and it's
[2216.14 → 2218.20] been an incredibly challenging day.
[2218.54 → 2220.08] So I'm bothering Luke.
[2220.46 → 2227.00] So, uh, uh, Nagano in float plane chat said, uh, you also assume you'll have good transit,
[2227.10 → 2229.44] having everyone heading in the same way when event ends is just as bad.
[2229.56 → 2230.00] Hold on.
[2230.16 → 2230.56] Hold on.
[2230.56 → 2232.68] I have such a good answer to this.
[2233.36 → 2237.08] His point about Vancouver is that everyone has to head in the same way.
[2237.38 → 2241.66] If it's out in the suburbs, it's more centralized and there's multiple directions people could
[2241.66 → 2242.06] head in.
[2242.12 → 2242.70] I haven't spoked.
[2243.22 → 2243.66] Yeah.
[2244.34 → 2244.74] Sorry.
[2245.00 → 2245.22] Yeah.
[2245.48 → 2245.88] Yes.
[2245.96 → 2247.38] That's the entire point.
[2247.46 → 2251.16] Instead of the arc of possible directions being like this V between my fingers, it's a
[2251.16 → 2251.64] whole circle.
[2252.12 → 2252.34] Yeah.
[2252.72 → 2253.66] And I, you know what?
[2253.68 → 2254.82] I honestly think it is.
[2254.82 → 2258.90] I think a big part of it is that, and I'm going to be generalizing right now based on my
[2258.90 → 2260.10] own anecdotal experiences.
[2260.10 → 2261.16] So don't take it personally.
[2261.68 → 2268.76] Uh, but it tends, my, my experience is that suburb people tend to be a lot more willing
[2268.76 → 2275.26] to travel for things than city people, uh, because they're just kind of used to it.
[2275.36 → 2282.06] It's kind of like the same way that, um, Canadians, uh, Canadians are more accustomed to shopping
[2282.06 → 2286.96] in, in U S dollars than Americans are to trying to convert their currency to anything.
[2286.96 → 2290.70] Like you have conversations with Americans, and you're like, yeah, well, you know, why
[2290.70 → 2291.46] don't we just travel there?
[2291.48 → 2292.58] And they're like, I don't have a passport.
[2292.66 → 2293.78] And you're like, why don't you have a passport?
[2294.36 → 2295.56] Like pretty much.
[2296.20 → 2296.74] Pretty much.
[2296.80 → 2296.94] Yeah.
[2297.02 → 2299.58] Every Canadian I know has a passport.
[2299.78 → 2300.30] It's a given.
[2300.46 → 2305.76] Whereas in America, it seems like it's kind of normal to just not have a passport.
[2305.90 → 2307.02] Well, what do I need a passport for?
[2307.32 → 2307.46] Yeah.
[2307.48 → 2311.44] But also every Canadian, you know, is within like half an hour of the border.
[2311.78 → 2312.38] That's true.
[2312.62 → 2313.10] That's true.
[2313.10 → 2316.24] If you look at the percentage of the Canadian population that lives within, I think it's
[2316.24 → 2317.34] two hours of the border or something.
[2317.44 → 2318.32] It's like 90%.
[2318.32 → 2319.38] Yeah, this is true.
[2319.82 → 2323.32] Uh, but like, so, so it's all, it's all kind of what's normal to you.
[2323.32 → 2323.54] Right.
[2323.58 → 2330.52] So I, I tend to find that suburb people are willing to cross bridges and cross boundaries
[2330.52 → 2333.02] and city people have a much lower willingness.
[2333.02 → 2336.76] Like their lifestyle just isn't, doesn't account for that.
[2337.12 → 2338.66] Um, see, I grew up where.
[2338.98 → 2341.18] I think part of it's a city taxes funding.
[2341.18 → 2346.08] I think it was about an 18-minute drive to the nearest like place where you could get
[2346.08 → 2346.84] a jug of milk.
[2347.60 → 2351.74] Um, so for me, it's like, yeah, I have to drive half an hour to somewhere.
[2351.82 → 2352.42] It's like, yeah, okay.
[2352.56 → 2352.72] Yeah.
[2352.78 → 2353.64] And pretty normal.
[2353.90 → 2357.60] Whereas, um, like, okay, for the badminton centre, for example, like a lot of my badminton
[2357.60 → 2360.16] buddies are like Richmond, Vancouver dwellers.
[2360.62 → 2364.76] And I was like, yeah, well, it's about, it's about 30, you know, 33 minutes or something
[2364.76 → 2365.24] for you.
[2365.28 → 2369.36] And they're like, yeah, I don't know.
[2369.36 → 2370.36] Okay.
[2371.06 → 2371.24] Yeah.
[2371.30 → 2371.64] Fair enough.
[2372.30 → 2373.26] I get it.
[2373.38 → 2374.26] I get it.
[2374.62 → 2376.54] So I think part of it is taxes funding.
[2377.24 → 2382.74] Uh, I read up a while ago on, on stadiums and how a lot of them like don't even really
[2382.74 → 2383.38] make money.
[2383.74 → 2384.18] Yeah.
[2384.18 → 2387.94] And a lot of it's just like, oh man, if you want to go by the cities, if you want to go
[2387.94 → 2396.70] down like a painful, painful, like corruption back alley deal, rabbit hole, just look into
[2396.70 → 2399.48] any publicly subsidized stadium deal.
[2399.68 → 2399.92] Yeah.
[2400.30 → 2401.76] It hurts.
[2401.96 → 2402.26] Yeah.
[2402.26 → 2410.14] Uh, man, the, the, uh, the chats are like, I don't, I don't remember the last time I
[2410.14 → 2414.30] saw them this active about something that is basically not even what we're talking about
[2414.30 → 2414.58] anymore.
[2414.62 → 2415.68] We're talking about passports.
[2415.96 → 2420.04] Oh, like, yeah, I, I don't, I have no passport gang.
[2420.12 → 2420.44] Like what?
[2420.50 → 2421.34] Why do you have a passport?
[2421.34 → 2427.46] It's one of those things that just seems to split people right down the middle.
[2427.68 → 2431.56] Everyone I know is super opinionated about it.
[2432.08 → 2437.52] The people that I know that have a passport are like, how on earth do you not, how could
[2437.52 → 2439.52] you possibly function without a passport?
[2439.80 → 2441.16] For me, it's your secondary ID.
[2441.16 → 2444.80] If you ever lose your wallet, it enables you to travel internationally.
[2444.80 → 2448.64] If you really, you know, flipping needed to whatever.
[2448.64 → 2454.60] And then everyone that I have ever encountered who doesn't have a password is like, yeah.
[2454.72 → 2455.40] And what do you mean?
[2455.52 → 2456.34] What would I need one of those for?
[2456.46 → 2456.64] Yeah.
[2457.08 → 2460.36] I'm just like, there's, there doesn't appear to be a lot of middle.
[2460.46 → 2462.28] The first person I ran into that was like that.
[2462.36 → 2466.14] I actually like sat down and was like, Hey, I need to have a conversation with you to just
[2466.14 → 2466.94] like understand.
[2466.94 → 2468.64] Cause it seemed so foreign to me.
[2469.02 → 2476.04] Um, but I think like if you, if you live, you know, not I've, I've lived within 30 minutes
[2476.04 → 2478.70] or less from a border my entire life.
[2479.08 → 2481.98] If that's not your situation, it's probably going to be different.
[2482.12 → 2482.34] Yeah.
[2482.40 → 2482.96] A hundred percent.
[2483.08 → 2486.96] What if you're in your thirties, and you've literally never had a reason to have one?
[2487.04 → 2488.48] Why would you keep paying to renew it?
[2490.44 → 2491.48] I mean, sure.
[2491.96 → 2492.56] I don't know.
[2492.64 → 2492.94] Yeah.
[2493.62 → 2496.26] I use passports to get on domestic flights even.
[2496.26 → 2497.74] Cause it just feels weird not using them.
[2497.74 → 2497.92] Yeah.
[2497.92 → 2499.26] It's like, but you don't have to.
[2499.40 → 2499.74] You travel.
[2500.00 → 2500.24] Yeah.
[2500.24 → 2500.98] You get your passport.
[2501.08 → 2501.60] Yeah, exactly.
[2501.78 → 2503.16] Like what do you mean?
[2503.16 → 2505.18] I remember someone was with me.
[2505.26 → 2508.50] We were going to Toronto for work, and they didn't bring their passport.
[2508.70 → 2510.50] And I was like worried that we're going to let them on the plane.
[2510.68 → 2511.96] They're like, no, it's a domestic flight.
[2512.02 → 2512.84] We're not changing countries.
[2512.88 → 2515.68] And I'm like, but it's a we're going to go to a plane.
[2516.36 → 2517.48] Like it's just, it's routine.
[2517.60 → 2519.48] Like when we're driving to the airport, it's like passport checks.
[2519.66 → 2519.80] Yeah.
[2519.80 → 2521.36] And everyone like makes sure they have their passport.
[2521.56 → 2521.86] Yeah.
[2523.00 → 2525.00] Like you have to have it when you go to the airport, right?
[2525.10 → 2525.52] Come on.
[2526.22 → 2526.66] Anyway.
[2527.00 → 2527.50] Uh, yeah.
[2527.64 → 2530.04] Gaming has been insane lately.
[2530.24 → 2530.68] I can.
[2530.68 → 2532.10] Oh man, they're not stopping.
[2532.10 → 2536.26] Gaming has been wild lately.
[2536.46 → 2538.90] I, uh, I have more criticism for Starfield.
[2539.08 → 2544.98] I also believe that 90 plus percent of the issues that I've had are solvable by modding.
[2545.12 → 2548.88] Therefore it being a Bethesda game means they will almost certainly be solved by modding,
[2548.94 → 2549.48] which is great.
[2549.80 → 2553.68] Um, and I feel like I'm getting to the point in Bethesda games now where I'm running into,
[2553.68 → 2557.76] um, factions and side quest situations that are getting very interesting.
[2557.76 → 2560.32] So I'm, I'm satisfied with the game thus far.
[2560.44 → 2561.36] Moving on though.
[2561.36 → 2562.78] Games this year have been wild.
[2563.00 → 2568.48] And I think it took Baldur's Gate 3 coming out, uh, for me to fully accept that we are
[2568.48 → 2570.08] in a fantastic era of gaming.
[2570.62 → 2571.46] Like genuinely.
[2571.92 → 2573.20] Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing.
[2573.66 → 2576.68] Starfield looks, it's definitely interesting.
[2576.96 → 2577.68] We'll leave it there.
[2578.06 → 2581.68] Um, Sea of Stars is one of the highest rated games I've seen in a long time.
[2581.68 → 2585.18] I'm super excited to play, but I'm not going to play until I finish Chained Echoes, which
[2585.18 → 2585.82] I'm very close.
[2585.88 → 2586.60] I'm on the final dungeon.
[2586.74 → 2589.14] So I'm like ready to, I'm ready to pick up Sea of Stars.
[2589.32 → 2591.06] He's digging Chained Echoes, which came out.
[2591.34 → 2592.84] Dave the Diver is super sick.
[2593.20 → 2596.90] Uh, I don't think it was a year ago, but it was last year.
[2597.32 → 2599.20] Elden Ring came out and just smashed.
[2599.76 → 2600.68] Completely smashed.
[2600.98 → 2601.62] Twos of the Kingdom.
[2601.80 → 2602.74] Absolutely fantastic.
[2602.74 → 2604.56] Did I mention Armoured Core already?
[2605.02 → 2605.20] No.
[2605.56 → 2607.62] Armoured Core, incredibly great.
[2607.74 → 2613.08] Yeah, I think you were, you were saying earlier that you are at the first, you're at a point
[2613.08 → 2619.54] right now where for the first time in basically as long as you remember, you have a back cattle,
[2619.68 → 2624.24] our back queue of games to play, all of which are from like this year.
[2624.32 → 2625.16] And all of which are amazing.
[2625.16 → 2625.76] The last 12 months.
[2626.36 → 2630.24] I can't keep up, which is like frustrating.
[2630.24 → 2633.98] Cause like I've been waiting for Starfield for, I don't know, six years or something,
[2634.14 → 2637.92] but Baldur's Gate came out, and it's an amazing game.
[2638.28 → 2641.36] And I have to like, you put it down to play Starfield.
[2641.38 → 2646.58] You haven't, if you work full-time and like to have family obligations, I think it's fair to
[2646.58 → 2653.02] say that there has not been enough time to completions, enjoy Baldur's Gate and now
[2653.02 → 2653.74] move on to Starfield.
[2653.86 → 2654.06] No.
[2654.20 → 2656.44] Like when did, when did, when did, when did Baldur's Gate 3 come out?
[2656.44 → 2658.38] It was just like a few weeks ago or something.
[2658.90 → 2659.48] Maybe a month.
[2659.48 → 2661.66] Things have been a little crazy right here.
[2661.66 → 2663.30] At least like Armand Core is short.
[2663.50 → 2663.84] Less than a month.
[2663.84 → 2664.70] August 3rd.
[2664.76 → 2665.64] And that's a big game.
[2665.70 → 2666.94] And that is an amazing game.
[2667.08 → 2667.74] 29 days.
[2667.98 → 2674.68] That deserves like replays and deserves thorough walkthroughs because like I, I, I, I'm hoping
[2674.68 → 2675.54] to play again with them soon.
[2675.54 → 2677.06] It's not even out on every platform yet.
[2677.58 → 2677.94] Yeah.
[2677.94 → 2679.58] Like they're still, they're still rolling out.
[2679.58 → 2685.30] They're still launching massive, not DLCs, just updates that are adding like content and
[2685.30 → 2685.94] fixes to the game.
[2685.94 → 2690.32] Like the, the layering studios are a fantastic studio that is treating the game extremely
[2690.32 → 2690.66] well.
[2691.12 → 2694.74] Um, and it's a, I, I, I don't know what to do.
[2694.82 → 2695.68] I don't have enough time.
[2696.00 → 2697.40] I can't play all this stuff.
[2697.66 → 2701.52] I, I'm, I'm planning on like rotating them a little bit, but that just means I feel like
[2701.52 → 2702.32] I'm never going to finish.
[2702.32 → 2707.12] But, um, I, Baldur's Gate 3 deserves, deserves the attention.
[2707.12 → 2708.78] So I don't want to completely put it down either.
[2708.90 → 2711.48] But like, there's even like things with Baldur's Gate.
[2711.64 → 2714.02] There's a and there are complaints about all these games, right?
[2714.04 → 2715.44] I'm not saying any of them are perfect.
[2715.84 → 2719.32] Um, like in Baldur's Gate, Pouffe brought up something that I think is a perfect point.
[2719.64 → 2726.64] Um, where in tabletop RPGs, like if you walk up to a scenario, if, if you, if you turn
[2726.64 → 2731.62] around a corner and there's the one who's, uh, has a, a, a beam from a house on top of
[2731.62 → 2734.32] them, and they're like trying to get it off of them, and you have to strength check to try
[2734.32 → 2735.24] to help them pick it up.
[2735.44 → 2738.98] If this was a tabletop RPG, your strongest character would go do it.
[2739.20 → 2743.86] But in Baldur's Gate, it's whatever one got around the corner first, and you can't switch.
[2744.36 → 2746.82] So if it's like your wizard, he's probably going to fail.
[2747.82 → 2750.82] That's kind of unfortunate, but I don't even care.
[2750.92 → 2753.62] You shall pass away now.
[2753.82 → 2754.48] I'm sorry.
[2754.70 → 2755.10] Basically.
[2756.64 → 2758.38] I'll just spam healing spells on you.
[2758.42 → 2759.86] So you just stay in pain the whole time.
[2760.18 → 2761.90] Uh, no, it's, it's, it's.
[2761.92 → 2763.30] That's more of a cleric thing.
[2763.62 → 2764.76] Yeah, it is.
[2764.88 → 2766.58] I just thought I'd point that out.
[2766.58 → 2766.98] He's right.
[2767.02 → 2768.12] That's not really a wizard thing.
[2769.64 → 2770.96] Magic missile, but curing.
[2771.08 → 2771.28] Blew.
[2773.74 → 2775.94] I'll magic missile the three of you and try to miss you.
[2775.96 → 2776.76] Curing missile.
[2777.80 → 2778.78] Oh, thank you so much.
[2782.56 → 2785.04] My ailment was healed, but now I have blunt force trauma.
[2785.60 → 2785.96] Um.
[2786.64 → 2787.18] Yeah, I know.
[2787.26 → 2788.30] Baldur's Gate is incredible.
[2788.74 → 2789.42] All these games.
[2789.50 → 2791.00] There's more that I forgot to mention.
[2791.32 → 2791.74] Um.
[2792.44 → 2794.32] It's just been, it's a it's been a wild ride.
[2794.42 → 2798.78] And I think, I think it's good to recognize when we're in these times.
[2798.78 → 2804.14] Because when you look back on it later, and you're like, man, games kind of suck right now.
[2804.48 → 2806.14] But remember that time, that was great.
[2806.38 → 2807.36] I should have appreciated it more.
[2807.44 → 2808.62] Like, no, I appreciate it now.
[2808.90 → 2809.86] These games are awesome.
[2810.36 → 2813.24] We're in a very, very, very, very strong era of gaming.
[2813.38 → 2814.02] And it's great.
[2814.02 → 2815.48] All right.
[2815.48 → 2816.60] All right.
[2816.64 → 2819.30] Dan, I think we're ready for whatever the next thing is here.
[2819.54 → 2819.98] Topic two.
[2820.08 → 2820.64] 20 minutes ago.
[2821.00 → 2822.18] That was topic two.
[2822.38 → 2822.58] Really?
[2822.76 → 2823.16] Oh, okay.
[2823.40 → 2823.58] Yeah.
[2823.58 → 2824.92] That was 20 minutes of topic two.
[2825.02 → 2825.40] That's fine.
[2825.50 → 2825.62] Yeah.
[2825.84 → 2828.36] I suspect you're pretty busy with merch messages today.
[2828.46 → 2828.68] Okay.
[2828.68 → 2828.72] Okay.
[2828.72 → 2831.30] Then what, what are merch messages, Linus?
[2831.32 → 2832.08] I don't know what you're talking about.
[2832.24 → 2832.66] Oh, right.
[2832.70 → 2834.02] I'm supposed to explain merch messages.
[2834.56 → 2835.16] You know what?
[2835.20 → 2835.78] Just for fun.
[2835.84 → 2837.20] I have to get logged into the dashboard.
[2837.32 → 2838.98] Why doesn't Luke explain merch messages today?
[2839.06 → 2842.44] Merch messages are our solution to the problems that we're having with Super Chat.
[2842.58 → 2845.46] And to be completely honest, at this point, we just like them more anyway.
[2845.74 → 2850.54] You can use merch messages by going to lttstore.com, purchasing an item.
[2850.86 → 2854.88] And then when you're in the cart, actually, so this is before you've purchased, you can select
[2854.88 → 2860.42] to enter a statement or a question or just send some form of message to us on the show.
[2860.90 → 2862.28] Dan will then see that message.
[2862.46 → 2864.74] It might be answered by Dan down here.
[2865.24 → 2868.82] If it's not a question or anything, it's very likely it'll just be shown on screen.
[2869.14 → 2876.30] Or if it is a question that Dan particularly thinks that Linus or me, I did that.
[2876.30 → 2876.72] Your name's Luke.
[2876.72 → 2878.82] Gesturing with my hands backwards, but it's all good.
[2879.60 → 2884.62] If he decides that we should answer it, then he will curate it for us to directly address.
[2884.88 → 2885.40] Which is cool.
[2885.46 → 2886.50] And it costs nothing.
[2887.52 → 2888.62] You have to buy something off the store.
[2888.74 → 2890.78] But the merch message itself is a free add-on.
[2890.92 → 2895.36] Yeah, it's our solution to, we think it's kind of weird that people just throw money at screens.
[2895.68 → 2896.56] Yeah, you should get something.
[2896.64 → 2897.34] So now you get merch.
[2897.50 → 2901.24] I've been asked a lot of times why I don't disable Super Chats then.
[2901.62 → 2905.62] And my response is, if people really want to throw money at the screen.
[2907.24 → 2907.92] Go for it.
[2907.92 → 2908.86] Am I going to stop them?
[2909.10 → 2910.28] We think this is better.
[2910.28 → 2910.92] Yes.
[2911.98 → 2919.66] Because at least this way, if we don't acknowledge your money throwing or whatever else, hey, you still get some high quality merchandise in the mail.
[2920.06 → 2926.46] And of course, this week, you could be getting some new high quality merchandise.
[2926.72 → 2927.24] That's right.
[2927.32 → 2928.70] It's finally launched.
[2929.26 → 2930.22] The Stubby Screwdriver.
[2930.62 → 2931.50] Have you seen this in person?
[2931.62 → 2932.42] You probably have.
[2932.68 → 2932.80] Yeah.
[2932.94 → 2933.30] Okay.
[2933.82 → 2934.46] I don't know.
[2934.52 → 2935.72] Let's do the Luke cam anyway.
[2935.88 → 2936.38] Don't worry, Dan.
[2936.38 → 2942.60] You don't have to get up, but Luke is going to show off all the different varieties of Stubby Screwdrivers we have.
[2942.98 → 2944.36] Actually, that's not all four.
[2944.56 → 2947.00] So it's available in all black plastic.
[2947.28 → 2948.48] So that's the one you've got.
[2948.62 → 2949.20] There we go.
[2949.28 → 2951.46] All black plastic with the silver shaft.
[2951.74 → 2957.80] It's available in all black plastic with the black shaft, which may or may not last that long.
[2958.04 → 2958.18] Wow.
[2958.96 → 2960.36] Like that.
[2960.44 → 2961.24] You're doing great, Luke.
[2961.24 → 2969.82] It's available in all black plastic with the orange and black with the silver shaft and orange and black with the black shaft.
[2970.52 → 2980.22] The black shaft might not stick around forever because it does still have the same issues with the plating on the full-sized one where it's not going to look like that forever.
[2980.36 → 2984.22] It's going to patina over time.
[2984.34 → 2985.18] Some people like it.
[2985.18 → 2990.64] They really like their worn black shafts, and they wanted it to be available for the stubby, so we kind of went, okay, sure.
[2991.00 → 2993.06] But it's probably not going to stick around forever.
[2993.18 → 2995.78] The silver one is a much more durable finish.
[2995.90 → 3005.12] I saw a picture of someone who worked in a mechanics shop or something, a mechanics shop of some sort, and they had a very worn LTT screwdriver that was black shaft.
[3005.54 → 3010.06] So it had that used patina and then also clearly used for some heavy applications.
[3010.06 → 3012.76] So some amount of wear on the rest of it, too, and it actually looked pretty sick.
[3012.86 → 3013.00] Yeah.
[3013.08 → 3015.92] But if you're not into that type of thing, I would not recommend it.
[3016.32 → 3017.72] Hey, do you want to talk about a bit storage?
[3018.08 → 3025.26] So it has the same pop-out bit storage as the full-size driver, but instead of 12 bits, it only takes one row of six bits.
[3025.44 → 3028.08] So you've got a Philips 0, a 1, and a 2.
[3028.50 → 3033.04] You've got a couple of different flatheads, and then you've got our classic magnetic bit,
[3033.04 → 3038.90] which works together with our super strong magnet in the shaft to hold on to basically anything you want.
[3038.96 → 3041.84] So you can, like, poke in and grab something if you really need.
[3042.00 → 3045.48] It has exactly the same—that's an aluminum water bottle, but good try.
[3045.92 → 3046.70] Oh, wait, no, is it?
[3047.32 → 3049.36] I actually don't remember what our water bottles are made of, but whatever.
[3049.42 → 3050.20] It's not going to stick to it.
[3050.74 → 3055.04] It uses the exact same well-known ratchet mechanism.
[3055.18 → 3059.50] In fact, Project Farm tested it and found that, yes, it has super low back force.
[3059.58 → 3060.72] That is a magnet, Luke.
[3060.78 → 3061.40] That's cheating.
[3061.40 → 3063.10] Oh, my goodness.
[3063.74 → 3064.90] Don't oversell it.
[3064.90 → 3066.14] Do we have something metal?
[3068.60 → 3069.38] Me right now.
[3069.48 → 3069.82] Yeah!
[3070.60 → 3071.00] Sorry.
[3071.64 → 3072.44] I don't know.
[3072.58 → 3073.34] Is this metal?
[3074.12 → 3078.60] Anyway, the point is, it's everything you like about the full-size driver, but stubbier.
[3078.72 → 3079.98] So we've got that on the store now.
[3080.34 → 3084.96] We also have—oh, I guess I—oh, I guess the short circuit for this hasn't gone out yet.
[3085.14 → 3088.40] So I should probably explain why it's not that much cheaper.
[3088.40 → 3092.56] It's not that much cheaper because it costs almost the same amount.
[3093.40 → 3093.62] Yeah.
[3094.02 → 3096.06] Most of the cost is in the ratchet.
[3096.28 → 3098.72] In the ratchet, which is the same size and all that.
[3098.72 → 3099.80] It's exactly the same ratchet.
[3100.00 → 3102.12] So all we're saving, actually—
[3102.12 → 3103.86] Thanks for that, Luke.
[3103.86 → 3111.90] All we're saving is this much plastic, six bits, and then this much raw metal material.
[3112.26 → 3115.72] Like, the actual tooling time for the shaft is not that different.
[3115.90 → 3121.04] And then the shooting time for the plastic is identical because you just—you shoot it into a machine.
[3121.12 → 3121.80] Like, it's the same.
[3121.80 → 3124.86] So there's almost no savings on it.
[3125.06 → 3128.34] So it's—yeah, so it's basically not that much cheaper.
[3128.78 → 3132.16] Ah, but we have some other really cool stuff.
[3132.98 → 3135.20] Have you seen all the solid-colour drivers yet?
[3135.38 → 3136.54] No, I actually haven't.
[3136.74 → 3138.92] Well, I see them right now, but I haven't seen them, like, up close.
[3140.24 → 3141.60] This is a lot.
[3141.84 → 3142.98] Is he going to hand me these?
[3143.66 → 3144.44] Because this is a lot.
[3145.18 → 3145.74] Yee!
[3145.84 → 3147.22] These are so cool!
[3147.22 → 3147.58] Oh.
[3148.26 → 3156.22] So from the build-your-own-screwdriver booth at LTX, we wanted to make sure that we had enough of every piece and every colour
[3156.22 → 3160.98] so that nobody would walk away without the exact colour that they wanted.
[3161.06 → 3163.62] But we were looking at it going, oh, well, gee, that's a lot of—
[3163.62 → 3164.52] That's a lot of combinations.
[3164.68 → 3172.26] That's a lot of wasted plastic parts if we're not going to—if we don't sell them all.
[3172.34 → 3173.02] So what are we going to do?
[3173.06 → 3173.86] Just shred them?
[3173.94 → 3175.96] Well, that would be stupid and wasteful.
[3175.96 → 3177.68] So no, we're not going to do that.
[3177.80 → 3180.96] We are going to assemble them into solid-colour drivers.
[3182.04 → 3185.72] So Luke can show off all the different colours of drivers here.
[3185.80 → 3196.62] We've got blue raspberry, pink pizzazz, red vibrancy—I'm just making these up as I go—eggplant.
[3199.72 → 3203.20] Orange that doesn't really look orange on camera but looks quite orange in person.
[3203.28 → 3204.06] Don't worry about that.
[3204.06 → 3209.98] Green sizzle and electric yellow.
[3210.76 → 3211.46] Not bad.
[3211.58 → 3212.16] I don't know.
[3212.26 → 3213.50] I'm doing my best over here.
[3213.52 → 3214.08] Not too bad.
[3214.12 → 3218.20] I think they're just called red, pink, purple, orange.
[3218.30 → 3219.84] We're really creative about our naming.
[3220.58 → 3221.22] Sometimes you are.
[3221.84 → 3223.40] Yeah, sometimes, often not, though.
[3223.40 → 3229.46] And then the last thing that is available, this one is especially limited time.
[3230.34 → 3232.48] Oh, is this drop-down new?
[3233.56 → 3233.74] Yeah.
[3234.04 → 3235.32] Oh, super cool.
[3235.32 → 3237.68] Yeah, the facelift hit the store.
[3238.20 → 3243.66] So there are other changes other than that, but there's a hover menu at the top now,
[3243.66 → 3247.32] which I think personally adds a ton of usability to the site.
[3248.12 → 3250.16] And it works in dark and light mode.
[3250.50 → 3251.94] Can you still get these?
[3252.58 → 3253.18] Anyway.
[3253.58 → 3254.14] I'm not certain.
[3255.18 → 3257.08] There's also the sizing chart.
[3257.14 → 3264.12] If you check out one of the say, shirts, the sizing chart is new and significantly better.
[3264.66 → 3269.58] There are also lots of other small changes, but those are, I think, the main ones.
[3270.56 → 3271.72] And where do I see that?
[3271.92 → 3274.68] I think it's in product description.
[3275.12 → 3275.72] Oh, size guide.
[3275.80 → 3275.98] Sorry.
[3275.98 → 3279.04] Right under the, over quantity, above quantity.
[3279.24 → 3279.72] Oh, wow.
[3280.30 → 3280.70] Okay.
[3282.30 → 3282.74] Hey.
[3282.92 → 3283.56] Oh, super cool.
[3283.62 → 3291.36] So it pops up like a modal type thing, which is a little bit more clear and also doesn't break the formatting of the site, which is good.
[3291.84 → 3292.28] Okay.
[3292.28 → 3292.36] Okay.
[3292.98 → 3293.42] Yeah.
[3293.44 → 3296.16] The last thing I wanted to talk about was mystery colour screwdriver.
[3297.56 → 3303.32] This is, as you can imagine, if people were building, you know, whatever drivers they wanted at LTX,
[3303.54 → 3307.04] and then we took the leftovers, and we made them into solid colour drivers,
[3307.60 → 3313.32] we can't control what people are going to use, and we can't control how many are going to be left.
[3313.36 → 3320.44] So we probably ended up with a bit of a poop mix of random pieces that didn't really match anything.
[3320.44 → 3329.70] So rather than waste those, we decided to go through the very manual process of assembling them into mystery drivers.
[3329.70 → 3334.72] These will come in any random combination.
[3335.54 → 3342.38] They actually do cost more than a regular driver because of how manual the process of creating this is at our 3PL.
[3342.54 → 3343.92] They just do cost us more.
[3344.00 → 3346.18] But, hey, at least they come with this pin.
[3347.32 → 3348.30] Look, a pin.
[3348.30 → 3350.66] They love pins.
[3351.24 → 3352.60] It comes with a pin.
[3352.92 → 3353.44] It does.
[3353.44 → 3359.12] See, I have in the past, I've always been, like, skeptical about pins.
[3360.44 → 3362.54] That's the context for what I'm doing right now.
[3362.68 → 3366.08] But Luke assures me that people are super into pins.
[3366.10 → 3366.34] People love the pins.
[3366.54 → 3370.64] I don't particularly care much, but some people are really into the pins.
[3370.64 → 3374.44] Dan, can you move us so that I can see this picture?
[3374.74 → 3375.48] Move us.
[3376.08 → 3377.68] I think the people need to see the pin.
[3377.82 → 3380.52] This is the pin next to the logo on an LTT backpack.
[3380.78 → 3381.28] Look, it's a pin.
[3381.28 → 3383.00] You just deleted us.
[3383.40 → 3383.76] Oh, did you?
[3383.86 → 3384.54] Oh, we're back.
[3385.28 → 3386.56] We can delete him, too.
[3387.24 → 3387.90] Watch this.
[3387.98 → 3388.54] Boom, deleted.
[3393.58 → 3394.26] Poor Dan.
[3394.46 → 3394.92] All right.
[3395.56 → 3398.78] He's going to make a Starfield character that looks like you, and then he's going to jump off a planet.
[3398.96 → 3399.78] Oh, okay.
[3399.82 → 3402.78] There's one last thing to talk about for the...
[3402.78 → 3403.74] This is dark.
[3404.46 → 3404.62] Oh.
[3405.30 → 3406.44] How do you jump off a planet?
[3406.44 → 3407.28] I don't think it's possible.
[3407.32 → 3408.18] What is wrong with you?
[3409.42 → 3410.40] Jumping off a planet.
[3410.40 → 3416.38] There are two more things for the store, but there are fewer things for us to announce to you and more things for you guys to tell us.
[3416.68 → 3418.46] We are working on a pet bed.
[3418.78 → 3421.86] It's going to be kind of cat or small dog sized.
[3421.98 → 3427.30] It's about the size of like a 19 to 21-inch CRT monitor.
[3427.30 → 3430.96] And it's got an opening in the front where the glass would be.
[3430.96 → 3434.62] And so the pet can crawl into it and hang out in a little like...
[3434.62 → 3436.90] And it looks super cool.
[3436.98 → 3437.64] It's like beige.
[3437.92 → 3439.16] Like a CRT.
[3439.88 → 3449.42] And what we wanted to know was for the pillow inside, would you guys prefer something that's more like a fuzzy finish?
[3449.42 → 3451.42] Kind of like our CPU pillows?
[3451.84 → 3455.70] Or do you guys want like the more like shiny...
[3455.70 → 3458.18] The more shiny finish?
[3458.30 → 3460.02] So the pros and cons both ways.
[3460.66 → 3462.96] This is a little bit...
[3462.96 → 3464.86] Is going to gather hair more.
[3465.44 → 3467.70] But it's going to be more comfortable and soft.
[3467.70 → 3472.24] Whereas the other one is going to be easier to brush hair off of.
[3472.38 → 3474.58] But it's maybe going to be a little bit less comfortable.
[3474.90 → 3477.18] So I'm going to run a poll for that now.
[3477.24 → 3478.58] Unless Luke is already working on the poll.
[3478.66 → 3479.60] I see him typing things.
[3479.82 → 3480.78] No, I'm typing other stuff.
[3480.84 → 3481.54] What do you want the poll to be?
[3481.62 → 3483.54] Luke's doing completely unrelated typing things.
[3483.74 → 3484.56] What do you want the poll to be?
[3485.10 → 3485.98] Soft material.
[3486.58 → 3489.16] So for the pet bed.
[3489.50 → 3490.58] For the pillow inside.
[3490.68 → 3493.02] Soft material or the slick material?
[3493.02 → 3499.28] Or the more slick, sleek, like silky, smooth material.
[3499.46 → 3501.84] So easier to wash or softer, basically.
[3502.64 → 3505.80] Like the silky material, the benefit is easier to wash, right?
[3505.80 → 3506.24] Exactly.
[3506.64 → 3509.04] Less likely to gather as much hair.
[3509.42 → 3511.44] And the benefit of the soft material is just it's soft.
[3511.44 → 3512.24] It's softer.
[3512.44 → 3512.60] Cool.
[3512.72 → 3512.86] Yeah.
[3512.96 → 3517.80] No matter what, we're going to make sure that the cover is removable so that it can be machine washed.
[3517.80 → 3524.96] We're just getting your guys' feedback on what kind of material, what direction to go.
[3525.52 → 3538.18] And then the other bit that we wanted to talk to you guys about is if you're someone who wears 4XL, 5XL, or 6XL, we are looking for alpha slash beta testers for our extended sizing.
[3538.40 → 3541.02] Both locally in the lower mainland and in other regions.
[3541.18 → 3543.72] So we've got a place where you guys can sign up if you're interested.
[3543.72 → 3548.50] It's a topic on the forum, and I'm just going to show it to you guys.
[3549.24 → 3551.92] Men's Extended Sizing Fittings by LMG Community.
[3552.08 → 3557.06] If you guys want to go find this, it's under LTT Official, lttstore.com, merch.
[3557.46 → 3558.48] And you can go seek it out.
[3558.54 → 3561.46] So we could get you guys some of the early samples that we have.
[3561.52 → 3562.22] You can give us feedback.
[3562.64 → 3565.28] We want these things to work for you.
[3565.70 → 3569.52] Something to note is that we aren't working on the tall sizes yet.
[3569.52 → 3573.02] So this is not a 4XLT or a 5XLT.
[3573.82 → 3575.50] That we're hoping will come later.
[3575.58 → 3581.16] We want to do the standard height, bigger XL sizes first.
[3581.86 → 3585.20] So we actually, yeah, we're asking for heights between 5'9 and 6 foot.
[3585.48 → 3587.26] So I am personally excluded.
[3587.78 → 3588.70] I am too short.
[3589.34 → 3590.74] We want Stormtrooper height, people.
[3590.88 → 3592.24] Between 5'9 and 6 foot?
[3592.44 → 3592.78] Yeah.
[3593.28 → 3593.96] Sorry, Luke.
[3594.08 → 3595.02] Neither of us are allowed.
[3595.10 → 3595.60] Get wrecked.
[3595.96 → 3596.72] We're both bad.
[3596.72 → 3596.92] Good.
[3597.28 → 3602.00] It looks like around 70, so far at least, 70-ish percent of people want soft material
[3602.00 → 3603.80] and 30-ish percent want slick material.
[3604.08 → 3608.94] Someone did bring up a pretty interesting point, though, where if you pick the soft material
[3608.94 → 3614.14] one and then, or if you pick the slick material one and then put a blanket over it.
[3615.36 → 3615.76] Yeah.
[3615.96 → 3619.74] I can tell you now the shape of the inside is going to be a little bit irregular.
[3619.74 → 3624.02] So wrapping the blanket around the bottom might be a little bit funky because it's kind
[3624.02 → 3627.00] of a T-shaped pillow because of the shape of the CRT.
[3627.46 → 3633.88] So the pillow sits in the bottom and the front of the CRT is like wide, and then the back narrows
[3633.88 → 3634.76] like a monitor.
[3636.44 → 3636.80] Okay.
[3637.16 → 3639.22] So it's a T-shaped bottom.
[3639.42 → 3641.48] Is this a dog bed or like a dog cave?
[3641.94 → 3642.42] It's a cave.
[3642.42 → 3643.00] Because those exist.
[3643.14 → 3643.28] Okay.
[3643.40 → 3643.54] Yeah.
[3643.66 → 3643.82] Yeah.
[3643.82 → 3644.14] Yes.
[3644.22 → 3644.42] Okay.
[3644.56 → 3644.68] Okay.
[3644.68 → 3644.86] Okay.
[3644.86 → 3644.96] Yeah.
[3645.00 → 3647.82] And it's more cat-sized just to be very clear.
[3647.82 → 3648.34] Was that communicated?
[3648.48 → 3649.58] Because that might change the answer.
[3650.24 → 3651.08] Oh, I don't know.
[3651.70 → 3654.76] I mean, I said it's in the shape of a CRT and you go in through the screen.
[3655.04 → 3655.40] Oh, okay.
[3655.94 → 3656.40] I wasn't.
[3656.46 → 3657.02] I was paying attention.
[3657.08 → 3657.20] Yeah.
[3657.24 → 3657.78] Clearly not.
[3659.94 → 3660.68] Two merge messages?
[3661.58 → 3661.92] Yeah.
[3662.10 → 3662.44] Oh, yeah.
[3662.44 → 3662.58] Sure.
[3662.70 → 3663.10] Hit us, Dan.
[3663.18 → 3663.48] Let's see.
[3663.52 → 3663.88] What do we get?
[3663.94 → 3664.32] What do we get?
[3664.94 → 3666.82] What's the return rate of those screwdrivers?
[3666.82 → 3670.28] Is the normal screwdriver allowed to be brought on a commercial flight?
[3671.34 → 3671.64] No.
[3672.18 → 3673.80] You have to check bag it.
[3673.80 → 3679.64] I think, I haven't checked with the team lately, but I believe our overall return rate
[3679.64 → 3683.36] is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1%, maybe like 1% and change.
[3683.62 → 3684.16] That's pretty good.
[3684.18 → 3688.22] That's about what you would target for a successful product that isn't crap.
[3688.22 → 3688.66] A physical tool project?
[3688.80 → 3689.02] Yeah.
[3689.28 → 3689.42] Yeah.
[3689.42 → 3689.60] Yeah.
[3690.00 → 3690.36] Yeah.
[3690.36 → 3690.98] It's very good, though.
[3691.00 → 3691.60] That seems pretty good.
[3691.76 → 3691.90] Yeah.
[3691.90 → 3692.38] We're really happy.
[3692.82 → 3692.98] Yeah.
[3692.98 → 3697.02] And yeah, don't take it in the cabin of a or don't try to take it in the cabin of
[3697.02 → 3697.32] a plane.
[3697.42 → 3698.94] It'll get confiscated by security.
[3699.10 → 3699.22] Yeah.
[3699.26 → 3700.96] You can take the stubby on a flight.
[3701.46 → 3703.38] Even then, though, I just wouldn't recommend it.
[3703.38 → 3704.20] I would check bag it.
[3704.20 → 3704.96] Just check your tools.
[3705.10 → 3707.78] If they don't like it, they're going to try to take it from you.
[3707.90 → 3708.10] Yep.
[3708.76 → 3710.56] Just think of your screwdriver as your privilege.
[3712.76 → 3713.56] And check it.
[3713.96 → 3714.28] Yeah.
[3715.84 → 3717.12] I don't know where I was going with that.
[3717.52 → 3718.40] Next up for Linus.
[3718.60 → 3718.78] Yeah.
[3718.94 → 3719.78] Question for Linus.
[3719.78 → 3723.30] What has been the most interesting thing you have learned from working with the engineers
[3723.30 → 3724.34] in the lab?
[3727.08 → 3727.44] Sorry.
[3727.62 → 3729.40] I, I, I tuned up for a second.
[3729.50 → 3732.78] Someone was upset that the screwdriver pin only comes with the mystery and the solid colour
[3732.78 → 3733.26] screwdriver.
[3733.76 → 3735.14] It doesn't come with it.
[3735.18 → 3736.06] It's like 10 bucks.
[3736.94 → 3737.10] Yeah.
[3737.10 → 3742.18] So it's like, it's, it's a value add, but it's, I mean, they cost more.
[3742.34 → 3747.90] We're just, it costs us more to make the things more than like the cost of a pin.
[3747.90 → 3752.08] And we're just trying to make it so that it's like overall a good value package.
[3752.90 → 3755.28] We're, we're, we're, we're trying to do a good thing.
[3755.78 → 3756.50] I'm sorry.
[3757.26 → 3757.80] I'm sorry.
[3757.88 → 3758.96] The pin didn't come with your thing.
[3759.02 → 3759.22] Okay.
[3759.30 → 3759.80] Sorry, Dan.
[3759.98 → 3760.60] That's okay.
[3760.60 → 3760.66] Okay.
[3760.88 → 3764.54] What has been the most interesting thing you have learned from working with the engineers
[3764.54 → 3766.08] in the lab?
[3767.56 → 3773.62] Oh, I mean, that's a that's a it's less like the things that I have learned and more
[3773.62 → 3776.96] the process of working with them has been really enjoyable.
[3776.96 → 3781.52] Like we have a we have a co-op student right now who you guys are going to meet for the
[3781.52 → 3785.04] first time sometime either this weekend or early next week.
[3785.16 → 3788.06] We got our hands on a Soviet era mouse.
[3788.08 → 3789.56] That's almost as old as me.
[3789.68 → 3793.54] It's, I think it was manufactured in like 91 or something like that.
[3793.60 → 3794.46] 91 or 92.
[3794.82 → 3799.58] So it's, yeah, not quite your age, I guess, but darn close.
[3800.32 → 3803.68] And, you know, when we first got it, we thought, oh, cool.
[3803.70 → 3804.26] It's cereal.
[3804.26 → 3806.30] So we'll just plug it into any computer with the cereal.
[3806.62 → 3807.52] Oh, okay.
[3807.52 → 3809.00] Was it an unknown?
[3809.28 → 3810.28] Looked like cereal.
[3810.78 → 3811.18] Interesting.
[3811.82 → 3818.60] But it was kind of like, it was as similar to cereal as my, my former Soviet stepdad's
[3818.60 → 3824.30] thing that he would call breakfast cereal was to the kind of cereal that I like to eat.
[3824.36 → 3829.38] He would just take a loaf of bread, and he would rip it into chunks, and he would put it into
[3829.38 → 3833.56] a cup, not a bowl, a cup for some reason, he would pour milk over it, and then he would
[3833.56 → 3835.06] just like eat it with his hands.
[3835.06 → 3837.40] And I was, and he was like, yeah, it's Russian cereal.
[3837.40 → 3837.90] I'm like.
[3840.06 → 3844.56] That sounds so much worse than just consuming both of those things individually.
[3844.56 → 3844.92] Yeah.
[3845.06 → 3846.88] I, I never really.
[3847.16 → 3848.24] Like, wow.
[3848.28 → 3849.36] That sounds so much worse.
[3849.50 → 3849.72] Yeah.
[3849.90 → 3854.74] I have done the like, I just take a piece of bread because I have nothing else to eat
[3854.74 → 3858.92] and just mash it into a ball and then eat that because I find the texture more interesting.
[3859.92 → 3866.22] Like I, I've been there, but I would eat that and then drink the milk, not do it at the
[3866.22 → 3866.70] same time.
[3866.78 → 3867.38] I don't know, man.
[3867.64 → 3868.16] But all right.
[3868.22 → 3868.42] Yeah.
[3868.42 → 3868.82] Sounds good.
[3868.88 → 3869.00] Yeah.
[3869.00 → 3869.28] I'm sorry.
[3869.28 → 3873.74] I really, I really can't clarify this for you any more than I already have because no
[3873.74 → 3876.58] amount of explanation from him has ever made it make sense to me.
[3876.90 → 3881.06] Uh, the point is that it was not cereal, just like his cereal is not cereal.
[3881.66 → 3885.32] Um, so working with, um, you know what?
[3885.34 → 3889.16] I'm just going to let you guys meet him because, uh, because yeah, he's, he's going to be in
[3889.16 → 3889.62] that video.
[3889.62 → 3895.40] So working with him on it, uh, he managed to get it to first go from absolutely nothing
[3895.40 → 3903.96] to it moves, but we can only move in one direction along one axis at a time or at all.
[3903.96 → 3907.14] Um, oh no, well, first we got to click.
[3907.90 → 3910.14] Then we got to moving along one axis.
[3910.30 → 3911.64] We learned all kinds of cool stuff.
[3911.66 → 3914.20] So you're saying it's powered along one axis.
[3916.58 → 3917.14] Stop it.
[3917.62 → 3919.68] That was post-Soviet anyway.
[3920.42 → 3921.46] It was funny though.
[3921.76 → 3922.68] Don't you start.
[3922.68 → 3924.62] Or pre-pre-Soviet.
[3924.70 → 3925.66] Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[3925.86 → 3927.74] Yeah, no, that was, yeah, no, the, oh, sorry.
[3927.82 → 3929.30] Yeah, no, I've got my, uh, okay.
[3929.42 → 3929.74] All right.
[3929.76 → 3930.04] All right.
[3930.06 → 3930.32] Okay.
[3930.38 → 3930.64] Sorry.
[3930.74 → 3930.90] Sorry.
[3930.94 → 3931.04] Sorry.
[3931.04 → 3932.90] I was, I was thinking nineties.
[3933.44 → 3933.86] Axis powers.
[3934.06 → 3934.16] Yeah.
[3934.24 → 3934.40] Yeah.
[3934.50 → 3934.68] Yeah.
[3934.78 → 3934.94] No.
[3935.14 → 3935.50] So yeah.
[3935.56 → 3937.92] The Soviets were an axis power, I guess.
[3938.12 → 3938.68] Well, hold on.
[3938.72 → 3939.08] Were they?
[3939.26 → 3940.32] I think I'm pretty sure.
[3940.32 → 3941.98] You get the Germans, the Italians.
[3942.14 → 3942.24] Okay.
[3942.26 → 3942.56] Hold on.
[3942.60 → 3943.88] Who was the who was the axis?
[3947.22 → 3948.00] Axis powers.
[3948.54 → 3949.42] No, no.
[3949.46 → 3950.48] The Soviets weren't axis.
[3950.76 → 3951.34] They were allied.
[3951.76 → 3952.56] I thought they were at the beginning.
[3952.68 → 3956.12] Five other, five other nations.
[3956.12 → 3957.20] Did they start there and then they flipped?
[3957.70 → 3959.06] Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria.
[3959.24 → 3959.36] Okay.
[3959.36 → 3959.62] Hold on.
[3959.68 → 3961.24] People are, no, they were not axis.
[3961.34 → 3961.56] Okay.
[3961.60 → 3962.40] So I don't even feel.
[3962.76 → 3963.78] What about at the very beginning?
[3964.10 → 3964.62] I don't know.
[3964.94 → 3967.46] Were they just neutral or not involved or something?
[3967.58 → 3969.16] Are you talking world war one or two?
[3969.42 → 3969.68] Two.
[3970.28 → 3971.46] Uh, yeah.
[3971.60 → 3972.10] I think that.
[3972.40 → 3975.88] I thought they were at the very, or the, uh, Italy.
[3976.06 → 3976.22] No.
[3976.32 → 3976.46] Maybe.
[3976.82 → 3977.80] I'm not thinking Italy.
[3977.92 → 3979.20] I probably just don't understand it.
[3979.20 → 3981.46] The point is I didn't get the joke and I don't feel bad.
[3981.70 → 3981.88] Yeah.
[3981.88 → 3982.24] Sounds good.
[3982.24 → 3982.52] Boom.
[3982.60 → 3982.92] Got him.
[3983.32 → 3986.60] Uh, I didn't get the joke for a completely different reason though.
[3986.70 → 3986.90] Okay.
[3987.00 → 3987.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3987.66 → 3991.48] So I was going to say the USSR de facto allied with Germany for the invasion of Poland, but
[3991.48 → 3992.84] then later on it was flipped.
[3993.02 → 3996.66] So this is, I, I don't know if that was part of the I might be getting some stuff wrong,
[3996.72 → 3997.64] but I'm not like, yeah.
[3997.76 → 3998.08] Anyway.
[3998.08 → 3999.08] It's fine.
[3999.08 → 3999.44] It's fine.
[3999.44 → 3999.84] Okay.
[3999.84 → 4001.04] Uh, moving on.
[4001.12 → 4005.54] The point is it was really fun working with the labs on the project as they, you know,
[4005.60 → 4010.48] dug through random Russian forums with Google Translate and managed to get the, you know,
[4010.60 → 4015.58] spoiler, managed to get the mouse working enough that I was able to play a modern FPS game
[4015.58 → 4016.02] with it.
[4016.02 → 4019.98] So someone who fully chat said, stop stalling the show.
[4023.30 → 4026.70] That's, I'm just going to, there you go.
[4026.78 → 4027.76] You get your own.
[4028.02 → 4028.62] Good job.
[4028.62 → 4034.40] Linus is angry.
[4041.80 → 4043.82] I'm just going to let him burn himself out over here.
[4043.86 → 4044.30] It's okay.
[4044.36 → 4044.80] We're good.
[4045.04 → 4046.12] We can move on.
[4046.88 → 4047.32] All right.
[4047.42 → 4048.74] Why don't we do another topic here?
[4049.48 → 4051.26] Wait, did we do two, two merch messages?
[4051.26 → 4051.68] We did.
[4051.80 → 4051.98] Yes.
[4051.98 → 4052.26] Okay.
[4052.54 → 4053.50] I fix it.
[4053.66 → 4058.42] Bringing the fight for right to repair to McDonald's.
[4059.30 → 4059.94] Yeah.
[4059.96 → 4060.56] Yeah.
[4060.80 → 4062.52] I think this is hilarious and cool.
[4062.64 → 4063.52] This is so cool.
[4063.62 → 4070.06] They bought and tore down a McDonald's ice cream machine in order to determine the cause
[4070.06 → 4072.32] of their well-known unreliability.
[4072.62 → 4077.92] In terms of hardware, as you'd probably expect for an industrial piece of equipment that has
[4077.92 → 4082.74] like a tiny crappy little display on it and otherwise does basically nothing other than
[4082.74 → 4084.20] squirt out cold stuff.
[4084.48 → 4086.84] The guts of the machine are pretty basic.
[4086.84 → 4090.14] They consist of a compressor, a motor, and circuit boards.
[4090.62 → 4095.56] However, the machines are prone to overheating and around 10% of McDonald's ice cream machines
[4095.56 → 4097.84] are broken at any given time.
[4098.10 → 4100.50] Which is remarkable.
[4100.50 → 4100.82] Crazy.
[4100.82 → 4105.48] And another incredible rabbit hole that I would strongly recommend.
[4105.60 → 4106.58] It's very interesting.
[4106.94 → 4109.88] The issue appears to be mostly software-based.
[4110.40 → 4116.40] The machine's once-daily repasteurization cycle takes around four hours to complete, but
[4116.40 → 4120.12] it is easily disrupted and often needs to be manually reset.
[4120.64 → 4125.02] The machine will frequently throw out confusing error codes which have to be interpreted using
[4125.02 → 4126.58] an obtusely written manual.
[4126.80 → 4132.56] According to a long-standing contract, all McDonald's ice cream machines are built and
[4132.56 → 4136.08] must be repaired by Taylor, the company that makes them.
[4136.52 → 4142.06] Taylor is typically slow to respond to requests and 25% of Taylor's profits come from the service
[4142.06 → 4145.18] technicians that are called out to fix these machines.
[4145.18 → 4151.12] And get this, they cost $315 every 15 minutes.
[4151.20 → 4152.02] So what does that work out to?
[4152.66 → 4156.12] $1,260 an hour.
[4157.88 → 4158.32] Wow.
[4158.82 → 4159.68] I need a raise.
[4159.94 → 4160.78] No kidding.
[4160.94 → 4165.22] Well, you're going to have to go to the ice cream machine repair industry.
[4165.76 → 4167.26] I got some bad news.
[4167.40 → 4167.88] I chose the wrong career.
[4168.02 → 4169.18] I got some bad news for you.
[4169.38 → 4169.60] What?
[4169.72 → 4171.68] The technicians aren't the ones making that money.
[4171.82 → 4172.20] Duh!
[4172.38 → 4172.94] Got them.
[4173.24 → 4173.66] Duh!
[4173.66 → 4178.96] At one point, a startup called Kick developed a device that automatically interprets the
[4178.96 → 4183.28] machine's error codes, allowing franchise owners to conduct their own basic repairs.
[4183.86 → 4185.52] However, this is great.
[4186.52 → 4191.80] McDonald's head office pressured franchisees to stop using it.
[4195.80 → 4197.24] It's just getting paid off.
[4198.50 → 4199.38] Pockets lined.
[4199.68 → 4200.32] So now.
[4200.38 → 4200.94] That's what that means.
[4200.94 → 4205.52] fixity is petitioning the copyright office for an exemption that allows third-party repair
[4205.52 → 4208.26] workers to fix industrial and commercial equipment.
[4208.42 → 4213.18] However, in order to bypass Taylor's digital locks, they are also requesting that Congress
[4213.18 → 4218.12] address flaws in the DMCA that protects this kind of behaviour.
[4218.36 → 4218.96] Let's go.
[4219.04 → 4220.34] Let's go fixity.
[4220.42 → 4220.92] Love it.
[4220.92 → 4222.00] The fact that, I mean, you know what?
[4222.00 → 4226.44] There are certain industries where I think you can at least make an argument.
[4227.18 → 4230.12] If we're talking about a machine that keeps your heart beating.
[4230.58 → 4230.98] Right.
[4231.02 → 4235.88] I think that if a manufacturer were to say, look, we should really be the only ones to
[4235.88 → 4236.90] service this thing.
[4236.90 → 4243.12] There's at least an argument to be made, even if the medical industry is extremely predatory
[4243.12 → 4247.14] and all the same things we're looking at here are happening, except in those cases, it's
[4247.14 → 4247.76] life and death.
[4247.84 → 4250.66] So it's, it reaches a whole new level of amorality.
[4251.26 → 4253.22] I'm not arguing any of that.
[4253.22 → 4258.80] I'd like to make that actually clear so that this, you know, doesn't end up being misinterpreted.
[4258.98 → 4259.08] Yeah.
[4259.16 → 4262.90] It's disgusting, but at least there's an argument to be made.
[4263.04 → 4267.28] And maybe, maybe, uh, I think some arguments could be made there too, where like building
[4267.28 → 4271.32] a code interpreter might be okay in that scenario.
[4271.54 → 4276.74] And then certain levels of repairs to certain things might be okay, but there's like certain
[4276.74 → 4280.90] levels of repairs that should really be done by fully certified technicians, et cetera,
[4280.98 → 4281.22] et cetera.
[4282.02 → 4282.94] I don't know.
[4282.94 → 4289.58] But, um, but an ice cream machine, this is not life or death for the most part.
[4289.70 → 4294.76] I mean, anything consumable probably is, but as anyone who's ever worked in a commercial
[4294.76 → 4301.56] kitchen will tell you, you know, that the, the, the repasteurization cycle on the ice cream
[4301.56 → 4303.96] machine is probably the least of your concerns.
[4304.54 → 4308.02] Um, yeah, yeah.
[4308.06 → 4311.50] I think have all three of us worked in food service at some point.
[4311.50 → 4311.78] I haven't.
[4311.96 → 4312.28] Really?
[4312.66 → 4315.34] I went straight into lifeguarding.
[4315.52 → 4316.76] That was my first job.
[4317.76 → 4321.22] Um, and I'm glad I did from everything that I've heard.
[4321.26 → 4325.22] But if you guys want to tell some stories, I always find these to be highly amusing.
[4325.22 → 4333.90] I would be careful of ordering taco pizzas from shops that you don't think taco pizzas get ordered from often.
[4334.78 → 4336.10] And why would that be?
[4336.12 → 4338.70] Because the sour cream sure might not be that new.
[4339.66 → 4339.88] Hmm.
[4340.00 → 4341.54] I mean, it's supposed to be sour.
[4341.92 → 4342.24] Mm-hmm.
[4342.66 → 4343.48] Real sour.
[4343.48 → 4355.12] That would be my main thing is like consider, consider to a certain degree how often the place you're ordering from is going through the ingredient that you're ordering.
[4355.34 → 4355.82] Get this.
[4355.94 → 4359.02] First response in chat is what the f*** is a taco pizza?
[4359.36 → 4362.28] So that should give you some idea how often these are getting ordered.
[4362.38 → 4363.12] But this is.
[4363.12 → 4364.84] Which is a big part of Luke's problem with them.
[4364.84 → 4365.40] Yeah, yeah.
[4365.54 → 4366.24] They exist.
[4366.34 → 4370.58] And it's like the only thing that gets sour cream in the whole shop.
[4371.02 → 4373.42] Um, so just think about it.
[4373.46 → 4377.80] If that pizza place is like famous for their taco pizza, maybe it's fine.
[4378.24 → 4378.72] Sure.
[4379.04 → 4380.74] But if you're like, wait, what the heck?
[4381.00 → 4382.52] Tots taco pizza exists.
[4383.26 → 4387.38] Uh, just consider it.
[4387.50 → 4388.28] That's all I would say.
[4388.40 → 4389.88] They might be completely fine.
[4390.00 → 4391.38] They might be totally above board.
[4391.52 → 4393.26] They might use the sour cream and other things.
[4393.26 → 4396.98] They might be very diligent about making sure that they're replacing expired sour cream.
[4397.40 → 4400.90] Um, but I guarantee you they're not all that way.
[4401.08 → 4403.90] So just, yeah, that's it.
[4405.60 → 4406.20] What's yours?
[4406.30 → 4406.58] We need it.
[4406.58 → 4407.30] We need a story.
[4407.72 → 4408.64] Oh, I was actually thinking.
[4408.74 → 4410.84] I used to work in Dining Back a house.
[4411.14 → 4411.50] Oh.
[4411.50 → 4414.52] A little bit, uh, more violent about that.
[4414.64 → 4415.24] Everything is clean.
[4415.34 → 4416.58] Top of the box every single day.
[4417.06 → 4418.34] Press every single day.
[4418.42 → 4420.02] Even our bread is made fresh every single day.
[4420.14 → 4421.42] Oh, that's pretty nice.
[4421.66 → 4422.60] That sounds like a lot of work.
[4422.60 → 4423.50] It was a lot.
[4424.08 → 4424.88] And that, yeah.
[4424.88 → 4427.06] The baker started at like 6 at the set menu.
[4427.68 → 4430.88] And the baker started at 5 a.m.?
[4430.88 → 4432.50] Oh, they can't hear you.
[4433.50 → 4435.06] Oh, I thought you did that too.
[4435.60 → 4435.88] Whoops.
[4436.30 → 4437.44] Uh, I used to work in fine dining.
[4438.14 → 4439.52] Okay, you guys get the story now.
[4439.60 → 4440.30] We'll just, um.
[4440.36 → 4441.00] Yeah, just do it again.
[4441.22 → 4441.64] Do it again.
[4441.64 → 4441.72] Uh, God.
[4442.00 → 4444.00] Uh, I used to work in fine dining.
[4444.32 → 4445.90] Uh, it was a little bit different.
[4446.04 → 4447.48] I don't know if I have any bad stories.
[4447.48 → 4448.90] But, uh, yeah.
[4448.90 → 4451.58] Everything was clean, tattoo, bottom, bottom every single day.
[4452.00 → 4454.44] Uh, all the ingredients were fresh every day.
[4454.52 → 4456.72] And it was pretty much only what we could get that day.
[4457.14 → 4466.24] Uh, leftovers like our veal stock and things like that would be made from leftovers from the previous day's service.
[4466.24 → 4471.52] And then boiled overnight and then skimmed and basically continued into the rest of stuff.
[4472.00 → 4473.58] Fresh bread every single day.
[4473.80 → 4475.10] All that sort of thing.
[4475.32 → 4475.76] I don't know.
[4476.22 → 4476.58] Desserts.
[4477.14 → 4480.50] So, what's this restaurant so I can exclusively eat there?
[4481.32 → 4482.78] Or, you don't have to name it.
[4482.78 → 4484.88] I won't name it publicly.
[4485.18 → 4485.44] Sure.
[4485.50 → 4486.56] But I'll tell you if you want.
[4486.64 → 4487.38] I don't know if it's the same.
[4487.44 → 4488.54] I haven't worked there in a long time.
[4488.72 → 4492.58] I think that's part of my point, though, is like, consider the restaurant that you're going to.
[4492.58 → 4497.28] And if you're like, ah, this place definitely pays everyone that's working their absolute minimum wage.
[4497.50 → 4499.04] And, like, doesn't treat their employees well.
[4499.20 → 4501.36] And is, like, a little not that amazing.
[4501.68 → 4503.28] And they have something that has...
[4503.28 → 4504.22] I've got a good tip for you.
[4504.70 → 4507.70] Taco, uh, sour cream stuff on it.
[4507.72 → 4509.14] And we don't think it's going to sell that much.
[4509.50 → 4510.82] Consider ordering that.
[4510.88 → 4513.80] Because their cleanliness levels and stuff might not be that amazing.
[4514.56 → 4516.26] But other places, it might be fine.
[4516.36 → 4517.26] I want to hear Dan's tip.
[4517.50 → 4518.66] Will they give you a tour of the kitchen?
[4520.72 → 4522.30] Imagine that, getting a tip from a waiter.
[4523.54 → 4524.24] I was back at house.
[4524.88 → 4524.90] That's actually...
[4524.90 → 4525.78] That's pretty interesting.
[4525.88 → 4526.16] Oh, okay. All right.
[4526.56 → 4526.68] Yeah.
[4526.74 → 4528.66] Yeah, we used to do tours of the kitchen.
[4528.68 → 4529.84] You did tours of the kitchen?
[4529.98 → 4533.10] Yeah, if you had a nice client in who was like, I'd really like to meet the chef.
[4533.18 → 4533.96] This meal was lovely.
[4534.04 → 4534.80] And we'd bring him back in.
[4534.88 → 4535.82] You know, floors are done.
[4535.90 → 4538.38] I don't think I've ever eaten at the kind of restaurant you worked at.
[4538.54 → 4538.74] Oh.
[4539.30 → 4540.10] Yeah, maybe not.
[4541.72 → 4543.92] Would it occur to you in a thousand years...
[4543.92 → 4544.16] No.
[4544.16 → 4547.64] To ask the server if you could have a tour of the kitchen and meet the chef?
[4547.90 → 4548.10] No.
[4548.28 → 4551.70] I mean, that's, like, super cool and sounds really fancy and awesome or whatever.
[4551.70 → 4552.54] Do they do that for everyone?
[4552.66 → 4553.92] Or does it have to, like, have spent enough for something?
[4553.92 → 4555.46] It didn't happen very often.
[4555.78 → 4559.94] But, you know, I think it's the kind of guy who would come in there and be like, this was nice.
[4560.06 → 4561.06] I have to meet this chef.
[4562.06 → 4565.08] That kind of person doesn't come through very often, if you know what I mean.
[4565.18 → 4565.68] Yeah, fair enough.
[4565.68 → 4571.12] I mean, it was clean enough, and we ran a tight enough ship that that was totally fine.
[4571.44 → 4573.34] Jake from the lab says, my story.
[4573.80 → 4576.86] X was a professional chef, worked at a high-end steakhouse in Bristol.
[4577.20 → 4582.58] And if anybody ordered a well-done steak, the chefs would toss it on the ground first and call it floor spice.
[4583.40 → 4584.78] I think that's, like, a crime.
[4584.78 → 4588.74] That is just a crime, I think.
[4588.98 → 4589.22] Yeah.
[4590.34 → 4591.44] That's, like, a game.
[4591.50 → 4596.14] Well, I don't know about in Bristol, but here I think you'd be breaking, like, actual laws around food safety.
[4596.14 → 4597.46] I mean, I can tell you this.
[4597.66 → 4601.54] I dropped one of the burger patties from the party, from the pool party.
[4602.04 → 4604.60] I have no idea who ate it, but they're not dead, so.
[4606.56 → 4607.84] Okay, but you're not a restaurant.
[4608.58 → 4609.54] I'm really not.
[4609.54 → 4610.74] Yeah, I think it makes a big difference.
[4610.74 → 4611.72] More of a ghost kitchen.
[4611.90 → 4613.06] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4613.16 → 4613.94] Yeah, there you go.
[4614.14 → 4616.70] And, and, and, and, and hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4617.14 → 4618.54] It was, uh-oh, chat.
[4620.16 → 4622.12] It was pre-being cooked.
[4622.54 → 4623.96] I was cooking them from frozen.
[4624.52 → 4631.80] So, like, basically, I might as well have dropped a piece of plastic on the floor in terms of, like, how much, you know, ground shoo.
[4631.80 → 4633.20] Oh, this is outdoors, mind you.
[4633.54 → 4637.32] But, like, how much porch shoo it managed to pick up.
[4637.32 → 4640.20] And it was pre-cooking it, obviously.
[4640.48 → 4645.38] So, it spent the next, like, nine minutes or whatever at 400 degrees Celsius.
[4645.38 → 4648.32] So, it's, like, whatever was on it is dead.
[4649.16 → 4650.38] It might have been me who ate it.
[4652.08 → 4654.48] One in, like, 45 chance that it was me.
[4654.56 → 4655.38] So, probably not.
[4655.74 → 4656.08] But, um.
[4657.10 → 4660.00] Some people are saying that I'm traumatized by this taco pizza.
[4660.20 → 4664.70] I, I actually, I got in a debate with my boss at the time about it.
[4664.70 → 4669.10] We had, like, a little fight about it because he was, like, ordering people to serve expired sour cream.
[4669.78 → 4670.82] And I was, like, pissed.
[4670.94 → 4672.34] But I was also, like, 12.
[4673.32 → 4675.56] So, there were limitations to what I could accomplish.
[4675.70 → 4676.00] Oh, sorry.
[4676.08 → 4676.84] 400 Fahrenheit.
[4677.02 → 4677.46] 400 Fahrenheit.
[4677.54 → 4678.80] We cook in Fahrenheit up here.
[4678.94 → 4679.36] I guess.
[4679.50 → 4679.82] Whatever.
[4680.08 → 4681.74] And we did, we did get complaints about it.
[4681.80 → 4683.38] So, like, it actually was, like, a big thing.
[4683.52 → 4684.02] But, yeah.
[4684.02 → 4688.50] To clarify, they would toss it on the ground pre-cooking.
[4688.58 → 4689.06] Thanks, Jake.
[4689.12 → 4690.14] That's, uh, very helpful.
[4690.28 → 4692.84] But they were probably not cooking from frozen.
[4692.98 → 4695.30] So, they probably picked up a lot more floor shoo.
[4695.68 → 4696.06] Yeah.
[4697.50 → 4697.90] Anyway.
[4698.40 → 4699.30] Let's move on.
[4699.72 → 4700.78] What's, two more topics.
[4701.30 → 4701.74] Oh, okay.
[4702.76 → 4704.24] What the f***?
[4704.24 → 4706.74] Oh, man.
[4706.82 → 4711.04] People at Float plane Chat are, like, going through their experiences.
[4711.40 → 4713.30] I worked for Timmy's when I was 17.
[4713.46 → 4715.98] I could write a book with the stuff I've seen people do.
[4716.04 → 4717.68] My direct manager was so lazy.
[4717.88 → 4721.44] She used to scoop the chocolate out of the tubs with her bare hands into the warming bins.
[4722.02 → 4724.34] Also, never order the broccoli cheddar soup.
[4724.46 → 4725.30] Hashtag facts.
[4725.58 → 4727.58] I think that's one of my examples, though.
[4727.78 → 4731.26] How many people are going to order broccoli cheddar soup from Tim's?
[4732.88 → 4733.68] I've eaten it.
[4734.24 → 4734.64] Mm-hmm.
[4735.50 → 4736.80] I like broccoli soup.
[4737.20 → 4737.46] Oh.
[4739.82 → 4741.52] I'm really unhappy about it right now.
[4741.60 → 4742.64] I get chili from Tim's.
[4742.66 → 4743.60] This might be just as bad.
[4743.78 → 4744.14] Oh, no.
[4744.20 → 4747.72] The chili is, if you, okay, this is all hearsay.
[4748.16 → 4753.98] But what I have heard said is that, especially if you're at a Tim's-Wendy's combo restaurant,
[4754.20 → 4758.40] the chili is made of the meat that is not good enough to put in a burger anymore.
[4758.64 → 4758.84] Nice.
[4758.94 → 4759.46] That makes sense.
[4760.16 → 4761.44] I don't know if that's true.
[4761.62 → 4762.54] That could be not a fact.
[4762.54 → 4764.16] I don't think that's true, because I don't think they make it.
[4764.16 → 4764.42] There.
[4765.42 → 4766.40] I don't think they just heat it up.
[4768.00 → 4768.26] Well.
[4768.26 → 4769.20] I think it comes to the store.
[4769.54 → 4769.98] I don't know.
[4769.98 → 4771.92] That was an interesting tip someone gave me.
[4772.00 → 4775.42] If you want to figure out if the restaurant that you're at is just reheating things, ask
[4775.42 → 4776.98] them to make a small change to a soup.
[4776.98 → 4780.26] ch5609 says perpetual chili.
[4785.80 → 4786.82] Oh, man.
[4787.76 → 4788.64] Yeah, cool.
[4788.84 → 4790.52] Wendy's chili is burger meat, apparently.
[4791.52 → 4791.94] That's it.
[4792.24 → 4793.00] The chat says it.
[4793.04 → 4794.10] I don't know if this is true.
[4794.46 → 4795.58] I don't know if this is true.
[4796.88 → 4797.28] Yeah.
[4797.28 → 4798.36] I don't know if that's true.
[4799.98 → 4800.34] Okay.
[4801.48 → 4801.76] So.
[4803.04 → 4803.64] I don't know.
[4803.84 → 4804.40] Fast food.
[4804.60 → 4806.28] I feel like we should move on from food topics.
[4806.32 → 4808.78] If we were trying to take care of ourselves, we wouldn't eat it anyway.
[4808.94 → 4811.36] So realistically, bring it on.
[4811.54 → 4811.80] Yeah.
[4812.32 → 4812.60] Yeah.
[4812.60 → 4815.90] Oh, we're supposed to do sponsors.
[4816.16 → 4816.34] Wait.
[4816.46 → 4817.92] Is this sponsorship?
[4818.36 → 4818.84] This part?
[4818.98 → 4820.54] This giveaway in partnership with AMD?
[4821.82 → 4824.42] Luke, do you want to show the people whatever this is?
[4824.62 → 4824.94] Sure.
[4825.18 → 4826.24] We can keep that camera.
[4826.34 → 4827.50] I can just pick it up from the front.
[4828.02 → 4829.62] I won't be able to talk, but we can do that.
[4830.30 → 4830.62] Here.
[4830.70 → 4831.64] I'll grab it for you.
[4831.84 → 4832.54] And we'll go to the loop.
[4832.54 → 4833.08] No, I can slide it back.
[4833.20 → 4834.48] I just didn't know which one we wanted to do.
[4835.16 → 4836.34] You don't have to do this.
[4836.42 → 4836.62] No, no.
[4836.62 → 4837.06] I got this.
[4837.24 → 4838.06] Oh, it's heavy.
[4838.72 → 4838.98] Hold on.
[4839.00 → 4839.22] No, no.
[4839.24 → 4839.66] I can do it.
[4839.68 → 4840.20] I can do it here.
[4840.90 → 4841.38] Hold on.
[4841.84 → 4842.54] I'm practicing.
[4842.96 → 4844.00] I'm practicing.
[4844.50 → 4849.28] I'm going to, for my career in the food services industry, that's going to come after this.
[4849.44 → 4849.72] Okay.
[4850.36 → 4850.72] Realistically.
[4851.72 → 4852.76] Your hair is too messy.
[4853.24 → 4853.78] Oh, sorry.
[4853.92 → 4854.06] Okay.
[4854.14 → 4854.42] Hold on.
[4854.98 → 4855.74] Which way does it go?
[4855.88 → 4858.64] I can't do this in a camera because it's the opposite of a mirror.
[4858.64 → 4859.28] You don't remember?
[4859.44 → 4859.80] That's fine.
[4860.06 → 4860.32] Service!
[4860.64 → 4862.76] No, I just do it whatever day kind of works that day.
[4862.76 → 4863.66] Whatever way works that day.
[4863.66 → 4864.44] Wait, you switch?
[4865.44 → 4866.02] I don't know.
[4866.20 → 4866.96] It doesn't have no one day.
[4867.38 → 4867.66] Wow.
[4867.96 → 4868.70] That's really weird, actually.
[4868.70 → 4870.22] My hair just goes that way.
[4870.44 → 4870.82] Hold on here.
[4871.02 → 4872.46] There's no decision-making.
[4872.46 → 4873.32] It'll go the other way.
[4873.58 → 4873.92] Hold on.
[4878.52 → 4879.24] What the...
[4879.24 → 4879.96] This is magic.
[4880.16 → 4880.86] What the heck?
[4880.86 → 4881.86] How are you doing, meds?
[4881.86 → 4882.74] This is madness.
[4883.56 → 4884.90] Stop this immediately.
[4885.68 → 4886.42] He's a wizard!
[4886.42 → 4888.80] Oh, I have to wash my hands now.
[4888.90 → 4889.32] Oh, crap.
[4889.42 → 4889.96] Okay, hold on.
[4890.62 → 4891.30] Mine's empty.
[4891.30 → 4893.20] I can just take...
[4893.20 → 4894.52] Oh, my goodness.
[4896.32 → 4896.72] Okay.
[4896.94 → 4897.20] I'll just...
[4899.26 → 4899.66] Okay.
[4899.74 → 4900.00] Why?
[4901.08 → 4903.48] Well, the chat told me I had to...
[4903.48 → 4903.82] Okay.
[4903.94 → 4904.64] Now it's over the box.
[4904.64 → 4904.90] Hold on.
[4904.98 → 4905.64] I got to...
[4905.64 → 4909.02] I don't actually know what's in here.
[4909.02 → 4909.82] Uh...
[4909.82 → 4911.06] What?
[4914.42 → 4915.02] Oh, wait.
[4915.08 → 4915.26] No, no.
[4915.26 → 4915.92] I'm doing this wrong.
[4916.56 → 4917.48] Here you are, sir.
[4917.98 → 4918.28] Oh!
[4918.28 → 4918.34] Oh!
[4918.34 → 4919.34] Okay.
[4923.74 → 4928.76] Well, I think we know that food service is off the table for Mr. Linus.
[4928.84 → 4929.26] Was that planned?
[4929.26 → 4930.44] No, I thought people like floor meat.
[4930.44 → 4930.46] Was that planned?
[4930.46 → 4932.04] It's got the extra spice school.
[4932.36 → 4933.24] School, yes.
[4933.30 → 4934.60] It's in our experience, I guess.
[4934.60 → 4935.22] Is this planned?
[4935.90 → 4937.80] No, it's a lot heavier at the front.
[4938.22 → 4938.48] Oh.
[4939.14 → 4945.06] There's a GPU in the front, and there's an empty CPU box with no heat sink,
[4945.06 → 4950.12] and a piece of paper in the back, so when I pulled on it, it just went.
[4950.68 → 4951.00] Okay.
[4951.10 → 4951.42] Anywho.
[4951.52 → 4951.94] Okay, here.
[4952.06 → 4952.62] You take it.
[4953.22 → 4953.62] Cool.
[4954.76 → 4959.56] Starting now until 5 p.m. Pacific time on...
[4959.56 → 4959.78] Oh.
[4960.70 → 4961.06] But...
[4961.06 → 4961.96] I kind of have to go like this.
[4961.96 → 4962.16] Until...
[4962.16 → 4962.72] Oh, gosh.
[4963.04 → 4966.20] Until 5 p.m. Pacific time on Sunday, September the 3rd,
[4966.20 → 4969.34] we are hosting a giveaway in partnership with AMD,
[4969.66 → 4975.00] giving you the chance to win one of five Starfield AMD Radeon RX 79
[4975.00 → 4981.26] XTXs and a Ry zen 7 7800 X3D with a premium edition game code.
[4981.26 → 4981.66] Oh, my God.
[4981.70 → 4982.88] The game code's not visible, is it?
[4984.12 → 4984.38] No.
[4984.94 → 4985.22] Okay.
[4985.58 → 4987.46] Along with a premium edition game code,
[4987.76 → 4994.52] just sign up at leg.GG slash AMD dash Starfield to enter for a chance to win.
[4995.90 → 4997.94] I'm going to post that in all the chats,
[4998.36 → 4999.86] or at least I'm going to try.
[5002.08 → 5004.20] Oh, there's even custom power cables.
[5005.44 → 5006.38] These are sweet.
[5006.70 → 5007.96] Yeah, that's good.
[5008.46 → 5009.00] No, it's cool.
[5009.08 → 5009.56] They're extensions.
[5009.76 → 5011.54] They're extensions for your power supply to the graphics card.
[5012.08 → 5013.62] So they fit the theme of your GPU.
[5013.74 → 5014.72] That's actually really cool.
[5015.38 → 5015.98] That's very cool.
[5016.94 → 5018.08] You're brushing this off, but it's cool.
[5018.28 → 5018.52] No, no.
[5018.58 → 5019.90] I'm just working on something,
[5020.00 → 5022.18] because that redirection link is not working.
[5023.34 → 5024.10] Oh, I see.
[5025.04 → 5025.36] Yeah.
[5025.64 → 5027.50] It doesn't even appear to be case-sensitive.
[5027.66 → 5029.02] Why is the processor not in here?
[5029.02 → 5032.60] Oh, I think Labs borrowed it or something to test something.
[5033.24 → 5033.70] No, no.
[5033.98 → 5037.56] Proof borrowed it for the Starfield video that we shot this morning.
[5038.60 → 5038.72] Yeah.
[5038.80 → 5042.50] I think that was like the high-end spec one or something like that.
[5042.58 → 5045.16] We used that, because I think Labs had all the other chips.
[5045.16 → 5048.14] And I've played Starfield on what is effectively this card,
[5048.26 → 5049.00] and it was great.
[5049.32 → 5051.40] So you'll be all good if you win this.
[5052.60 → 5055.46] Yeah, I think this link doesn't work.
[5056.88 → 5058.66] Have we opened this GPU?
[5058.78 → 5059.76] Can I show the GPU off?
[5059.80 → 5060.50] Yeah, just show the GPU.
[5060.60 → 5060.78] Whatever.
[5060.92 → 5062.18] If people get the opened one,
[5062.26 → 5064.36] then they'll know that we pretested it.
[5064.40 → 5065.32] We sour-creamed it.
[5066.32 → 5066.72] Wait.
[5066.88 → 5067.60] It's also wet.
[5067.60 → 5068.62] That came across wrong.
[5068.62 → 5074.44] I need to message someone and find out what's going on with that link.
[5076.24 → 5077.04] Actually, oh, Dan.
[5077.14 → 5077.96] Dan, can you do that?
[5078.14 → 5078.58] Do what?
[5078.72 → 5079.84] Oh, it looks so cool.
[5079.98 → 5080.72] Can you message Colton?
[5080.78 → 5081.34] Okay, hold on.
[5081.36 → 5082.06] We're going back to the...
[5082.06 → 5082.56] Oh, dang it.
[5084.32 → 5085.46] Just take it out of the box.
[5085.48 → 5085.98] You're going to drop it.
[5086.06 → 5086.34] Yeah, yeah.
[5086.48 → 5087.08] You're all good.
[5087.32 → 5087.64] You're all good.
[5087.68 → 5088.28] Let's see the backside.
[5088.48 → 5089.62] I'm not going to drop it, Dan.
[5089.90 → 5090.26] Whoa.
[5090.26 → 5092.90] It even has little colour accents on the thing.
[5093.12 → 5094.12] Okay, this is sick.
[5094.40 → 5098.60] First, you get a red, orange, and blue little striping on the...
[5098.60 → 5099.80] Okay, that's pretty cool.
[5100.20 → 5101.18] And then check out the back.
[5102.28 → 5103.86] Why did they only do five of these?
[5103.90 → 5105.16] They should have done a whack of these.
[5106.82 → 5107.86] Man, that's awesome.
[5109.92 → 5112.34] It looks cooler when you're up close, I will say.
[5112.44 → 5113.64] I'm trying to look at it on the TV.
[5114.40 → 5115.90] It looks a lot cooler when you're up close.
[5116.00 → 5118.40] So in your system, this will look even better than it does here.
[5118.40 → 5119.74] It's got a really nice finish.
[5120.84 → 5126.72] If I were you, and you won this, I would keep the not for resale sticker on here because that is sick.
[5127.14 → 5128.40] That looks super cool.
[5128.60 → 5132.98] And then if you end up mounting it this way, that's pretty sweet.
[5133.16 → 5133.58] Oh, that's sick.
[5133.68 → 5135.04] Graphic booster propellant.
[5135.16 → 5135.82] That's cool.
[5137.14 → 5138.46] I think it looks great.
[5138.62 → 5139.76] This is a really cool design.
[5140.02 → 5141.56] You can see on the end, little star.
[5142.08 → 5142.54] All right.
[5142.66 → 5143.34] Flight crew.
[5144.54 → 5145.50] Yeah, that's super cool.
[5146.00 → 5146.28] All right.
[5146.32 → 5146.44] Awesome design.
[5146.44 → 5148.96] So guys, for a chance to win, check out the LTT Twitter.
[5149.52 → 5150.42] We will have...
[5150.42 → 5152.90] Oh, the Gleam.io link is in the float plane chat.
[5152.96 → 5154.00] Hey, way to go, float plane.
[5154.44 → 5154.90] All right.
[5154.90 → 5155.50] Thank you.
[5155.62 → 5160.24] I will get that into the other chats.
[5160.38 → 5161.66] Really appreciate you guys.
[5162.42 → 5165.84] Man, shout out float plane for just being the flipping coolest.
[5166.84 → 5168.02] You guys are great.
[5168.68 → 5169.26] Pretty much.
[5169.76 → 5170.64] Pretty much.
[5171.62 → 5173.72] Thanks for your support in every way, guys.
[5175.72 → 5176.20] All right.
[5176.26 → 5179.04] Let's go ahead and jump into...
[5179.04 → 5179.42] Oh, right.
[5179.52 → 5179.92] Sponsors.
[5180.00 → 5180.80] I'm supposed to do that.
[5181.24 → 5181.94] Right, right, right, right, right.
[5181.98 → 5184.18] The show is brought to you by Sea sonic.
[5185.80 → 5189.06] Imagine baking bread with a wacky and powerless oven.
[5189.06 → 5192.36] Your bread is not going to be as beautiful as this Dan bread.
[5193.20 → 5194.64] It's the same for your PC.
[5195.68 → 5200.92] Sea sonic, our sponsor, offers powerful and steady power supplies like the Focus GO 750,
[5201.50 → 5205.32] ensuring that your power is delivered efficiently and with less heat.
[5205.64 → 5206.10] That's right.
[5206.16 → 5208.62] You won't be baking bread on your power supply.
[5208.84 → 5212.02] It's fully modular and uses a hybrid fan system,
[5212.14 → 5216.94] so you have less noise without having to deal with increased temperatures.
[5216.94 → 5223.10] Their entire Focus GO lineup is 80-plus gold rated and comes with a 10-year warranty.
[5223.20 → 5224.46] I don't know why that says 80-plus platinum.
[5225.02 → 5226.86] Oh, that says Focus PX.
[5226.92 → 5227.68] Don't worry about that.
[5227.80 → 5229.70] It's the GO line that we're talking about today.
[5229.80 → 5230.80] They are 80-plus gold.
[5231.42 → 5237.04] And these guys are not trying to sell you a power supply with RGB or gaudy colour options.
[5237.16 → 5239.04] They just want something that you can count on.
[5239.12 → 5240.76] They want you to have something you can count on.
[5241.04 → 5244.96] So keep them in mind for your next build at seasonic.com or at the link down below.
[5245.74 → 5246.22] All right.
[5246.22 → 5247.96] Yeah, a lot of the collateral is Focus PX.
[5248.04 → 5248.88] Don't worry about that.
[5249.00 → 5252.04] Basically, it's the same thing, but 80-plus platinum.
[5252.22 → 5255.60] It's the more premium, more efficient version of the GO.
[5256.94 → 5259.08] Really hard to go wrong with anything from these guys, though.
[5259.26 → 5259.58] True.
[5259.86 → 5262.74] The show is also brought to you by PDF.
[5263.52 → 5266.58] Don't you feel awful when you write something online or on a PDF
[5266.58 → 5268.30] and you just can't edit it afterward?
[5270.70 → 5271.14] Wow.
[5271.14 → 5271.36] Wow.
[5272.70 → 5274.02] They went there?
[5276.36 → 5277.42] I blame Dennis.
[5277.84 → 5281.88] I also blame whoever approved this copy because I'm sure that someone saw it.
[5281.92 → 5282.60] Was it you, Lou?
[5282.74 → 5283.08] No.
[5283.40 → 5283.80] No.
[5284.02 → 5284.86] No, I didn't see this.
[5285.12 → 5286.02] It's amazing.
[5286.36 → 5288.84] I probably would have approved it, but no, that is not my...
[5288.84 → 5290.00] I mean, I deserve it.
[5290.68 → 5294.38] PDF, our sponsor, is here to help you fix the all things PDF.
[5295.06 → 5299.98] PDF is an advanced PDF editor that's available on Windows, Mac, iPad, iOS, and Android.
[5299.98 → 5304.72] And their features include PDF editing, reading, signing, annotating, converting, compressing,
[5304.82 → 5306.80] creating, and even filling forms.
[5306.90 → 5307.50] That's a long list.
[5308.04 → 5309.28] And that's not all.
[5309.36 → 5312.98] They even offer this AI feature, Optical Character Recognition,
[5313.66 → 5316.64] which transforms images into editable and searchable text.
[5317.26 → 5320.40] If you're too lazy to read a long essay, PDF has you covered.
[5320.74 → 5323.34] The AI feature can summarize it, explain in-depth reports,
[5323.44 → 5326.20] and even translate it into different languages in seconds.
[5326.20 → 5330.66] With a single premium account, you can access the app on two desktops and two mobile devices,
[5330.94 → 5335.04] and it's $43.99 for their perpetual plan, which gives you lifetime access.
[5335.30 → 5338.52] So it's one of the most reasonably priced PDF editors out there.
[5338.72 → 5340.72] For our viewers, you deserve a special deal.
[5341.02 → 5345.06] You'll get 63% off by checking them out at the link down below.
[5346.18 → 5348.18] Finally, the show is brought to you today by Kudos.
[5348.96 → 5350.78] You can get awards for being a good boy.
[5351.42 → 5353.16] Definitely not Linus lately.
[5353.42 → 5355.20] Or for shopping with credit cards.
[5355.20 → 5359.94] But since I'm Linus, I can only get rewards through credit cards.
[5362.44 → 5370.94] Can you tell that internally people have some thoughts on my initial handling of the recent controversy?
[5372.16 → 5372.76] Spicy.
[5374.54 → 5378.90] Anyway, Kudos helps me double my credit card rewards.
[5379.60 → 5383.46] Kudos is a free browser extension that helps you earn more whenever you shop online.
[5383.46 → 5388.02] So if you usually earn 3% from your credit cards on sites like Booking.com or Uniqlo,
[5388.20 → 5390.26] you will now get 6% back with Kudos.
[5390.80 → 5398.16] Plus, they just launched Maria GPT, their personalized AI-powered assistant that answers all your credit card-related questions.
[5398.56 → 5402.26] So instead of doing a bunch of research on which credit cards have the highest welcome bonus,
[5402.62 → 5404.44] Maria GPT will have the answer for you.
[5404.44 → 5409.22] The average Kudos user saves over $750 a year, according to Kudos.
[5409.44 → 5417.58] So be a good boy and use code WAN to get Kudos for free by clicking the link below or going to joinkudos.com slash WAN.
[5418.90 → 5424.26] That may have been the single spiciest sponsor segment that we have ever done on the WAN show.
[5424.26 → 5426.92] I think it had two weeks to simmer, right?
[5427.08 → 5430.06] Out of 10, out of 10, do you think I had it coming?
[5430.88 → 5431.44] Oh, yeah.
[5432.94 → 5434.26] He's not even going to give a number.
[5434.60 → 5436.66] No, no, just, I don't know, 10.
[5437.24 → 5439.20] I don't think it's the spiciest one we've ever done, though,
[5439.24 → 5441.46] but I don't even want to reference the one that I think was spicier.
[5441.80 → 5444.00] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
[5444.40 → 5445.96] I don't think we're going to talk about that.
[5446.56 → 5446.72] Yeah.
[5446.92 → 5447.88] Was it a long time ago?
[5448.14 → 5448.36] No.
[5448.68 → 5450.36] Oh, okay, then you're probably wrong.
[5450.36 → 5451.40] Oh.
[5453.80 → 5454.24] Hmm.
[5455.44 → 5455.98] All right.
[5456.48 → 5456.96] Yeah.
[5457.52 → 5458.00] Cool.
[5458.78 → 5459.94] Uh, Lenovo.
[5461.40 → 5461.56] What?
[5461.76 → 5462.46] Oh, three merch.
[5462.54 → 5463.12] Oh, sorry, Dan.
[5463.18 → 5463.46] Hit us.
[5464.76 → 5465.54] Uh, let's see.
[5465.68 → 5468.90] Any chance of even more special bits for the screwdriver?
[5469.76 → 5470.16] Hold on.
[5470.30 → 5471.46] They're texting each other.
[5471.60 → 5472.26] Oh, yeah.
[5472.44 → 5472.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5473.00 → 5473.22] Okay.
[5473.46 → 5473.66] Okay.
[5474.06 → 5474.54] Okay.
[5474.76 → 5474.96] Okay.
[5475.24 → 5475.54] Yeah.
[5475.54 → 5476.50] I was wrong.
[5476.50 → 5481.52] I forgot about that.
[5484.24 → 5484.86] Sorry, Dan.
[5484.92 → 5485.36] Keep going.
[5485.46 → 5485.78] We're good.
[5485.86 → 5486.80] That's totally fine.
[5486.94 → 5487.16] Yeah.
[5487.58 → 5488.32] Enjoy your moment.
[5488.38 → 5491.52] It's a funny thing to all the people that are like, you know, yeah.
[5492.30 → 5494.48] Why does Linus keep putting his foot in his mouth lately?
[5497.06 → 5498.32] It ain't new, man.
[5499.64 → 5500.00] Just.
[5500.56 → 5501.20] No hints.
[5501.32 → 5501.50] Nope.
[5501.56 → 5501.74] Nope.
[5501.74 → 5501.98] Sorry.
[5502.08 → 5502.40] Go, Dan.
[5502.62 → 5503.18] We're moving on.
[5503.28 → 5505.64] He asked if there's going to be more specialty bits for the screwdrivers.
[5505.64 → 5506.48] The answer is yes.
[5507.06 → 5508.12] We are planning.
[5508.26 → 5508.82] Oh, hey, Dan.
[5508.92 → 5510.66] Throw me that thing that you were fidgeting with earlier.
[5510.82 → 5512.40] Luke has it to fidget thing with.
[5512.64 → 5513.12] Okay, cool.
[5513.66 → 5516.00] Is this, which version of the bearing is this?
[5516.38 → 5517.42] The bad one.
[5518.36 → 5519.54] Not the new one.
[5519.70 → 5520.72] This is not the new one.
[5520.78 → 5521.04] No.
[5521.30 → 5521.60] Okay.
[5521.78 → 5522.10] Give it a.
[5522.10 → 5522.58] Still goes hard.
[5522.62 → 5523.56] So I'm just going to go like this.
[5523.56 → 5523.82] Still goes hard.
[5525.18 → 5529.42] And then I'm going to talk about some of the different screwdriver bits that we have planned.
[5529.42 → 5535.46] And I know that we have some additional head types for like the quarter inch hex drive ones,
[5535.56 → 5536.86] like the full size and the stubby.
[5537.14 → 5543.48] And then we also have a full set of bits that is going to come with our precision driver at some point.
[5543.58 → 5544.54] I just want to clarify.
[5546.84 → 5547.50] Still going.
[5547.70 → 5548.74] And this is the bad version.
[5548.96 → 5549.48] This is the bad version.
[5549.48 → 5550.60] This is the crunchy one.
[5550.76 → 5551.96] It didn't quite stop before you moved.
[5551.96 → 5557.10] I do want to clarify that the point of this driver is not to compete directly with someone like an fixity.
[5557.14 → 5558.00] We love fixity.
[5558.08 → 5558.90] We love their mission.
[5559.22 → 5563.38] There are so many things that they do that we are just not even going to begin to approach.
[5563.50 → 5567.22] I love what they've done with the McDonald's things, the teardowns, the guides.
[5568.12 → 5574.90] But we do think there's space for a fidget toy premium driver.
[5575.04 → 5578.88] Fidget toy grade driver that also has a bit storage.
[5578.88 → 5582.04] It's going to probably be quite a bit more expensive than the fixity driver.
[5582.94 → 5586.04] You saw the one with the big back rest, right?
[5586.58 → 5588.18] It had the giant pommel on the back.
[5588.26 → 5588.40] Yeah.
[5588.46 → 5593.36] So one of the features that's going to differentiate ours is we're trying to do interchangeable tops.
[5594.28 → 5598.26] So you could have one that really is just a precision driver with a fidget toy at the top.
[5598.36 → 5599.48] Do you know how long it's spun for?
[5600.14 → 5600.90] No, I don't.
[5601.08 → 5601.84] Seven minutes.
[5602.00 → 5602.72] That's pretty cool.
[5602.86 → 5604.26] Was that with the good bearing though?
[5604.34 → 5604.72] I don't know.
[5604.78 → 5606.24] I don't even think they have them in yet.
[5606.60 → 5606.84] Yeah.
[5606.84 → 5607.40] So anyway.
[5607.40 → 5607.84] Yeah.
[5608.28 → 5610.76] So we'll have all kinds of different bits coming.
[5611.28 → 5618.10] And in the long term, we would love to allow people to just order individual bits and make
[5618.10 → 5618.72] their own sets.
[5618.90 → 5624.64] But for the time being, we can only do them as packs just because of how kind of relatively
[5624.64 → 5626.94] unsophisticated our pick and pack procedures are.
[5628.82 → 5629.22] Okay.
[5629.54 → 5630.42] Another merch message?
[5630.88 → 5631.26] Sure, sure, sure.
[5632.02 → 5632.76] Let's see.
[5633.40 → 5634.68] Are you fidgeting with that under the table?
[5634.74 → 5636.28] Because I can definitely hear that from Mike.
[5636.28 → 5636.88] Sorry, I'll stop.
[5636.96 → 5639.28] Yeah, I shouldn't have left it with him.
[5639.48 → 5640.24] I need to put it down.
[5640.36 → 5640.48] Yeah.
[5641.40 → 5641.82] Let's see.
[5641.86 → 5642.82] This thing seems fun.
[5643.20 → 5649.12] Given LTT's growth, would you ever consider private jet travel for yourself or other employees
[5649.12 → 5651.12] instead of booking an airline ticket?
[5651.12 → 5657.88] It's one of those things that I think would be kind of fun to experience once.
[5658.44 → 5670.54] But I don't want to be judgy, but I'm personally kind of opposed to the private air travel industry.
[5670.54 → 5675.76] I don't think it sends a good message.
[5675.90 → 5680.66] I don't think it's particularly helpful in a lot of ways.
[5680.74 → 5682.24] Obviously, it helps people save time.
[5682.40 → 5686.54] Other than that, there's some stuff about it that I find, you know...
[5688.54 → 5690.50] How do I put this?
[5690.90 → 5692.06] I'm not a fan, personally.
[5692.56 → 5698.54] I've only flown first class once.
[5698.98 → 5699.60] Hey, me too.
[5699.68 → 5700.30] Exactly once.
[5700.42 → 5700.60] Yeah.
[5701.32 → 5702.94] It happened to be...
[5702.94 → 5703.64] It wasn't my choice.
[5703.76 → 5703.92] Yeah.
[5703.96 → 5706.60] It happened to be just the ticket they booked.
[5707.02 → 5707.18] Yep.
[5707.32 → 5707.60] Me too.
[5707.78 → 5711.58] Like in the early days of the company, I would have people offer it often.
[5711.58 → 5716.52] And what I would always say is, I can't pay my staff with a first class plane ticket.
[5716.70 → 5721.52] So what I would actually like you to do is, since I know you have the budget for it,
[5721.56 → 5727.16] you can pay me another couple grand, and we'll do the deal, and I'll fly coach.
[5728.20 → 5731.86] I have pulled that move a lot of times over the years.
[5733.02 → 5735.08] And so, yeah, I just...
[5735.08 → 5737.66] There are a lot of things about it that make me kind of uncomfortable.
[5737.66 → 5744.82] And I get that this is something that people either don't believe or don't want to hear
[5744.82 → 5750.66] or whatever else, but I don't actually like feeling separated.
[5751.92 → 5752.66] I...
[5752.66 → 5758.90] Like even at our lands, we have staff areas that are cordoned off for people who prefer that.
[5759.08 → 5763.96] But I prefer to just sit with everyone.
[5764.12 → 5767.12] Like I don't like to be separated.
[5767.12 → 5771.40] There are reasons that that is like probably kind of better if I actually wanted to play games
[5771.40 → 5773.30] because people do interrupt me a lot.
[5773.84 → 5775.12] But I just...
[5775.98 → 5776.30] I don't know.
[5776.36 → 5778.70] It's not something that I'm particularly comfortable with.
[5779.12 → 5780.74] And I've sprung for some...
[5780.74 → 5781.22] I don't like it.
[5781.54 → 5783.64] Like economy plus seats before.
[5784.18 → 5784.28] If...
[5784.28 → 5784.92] Well, you're tall.
[5785.16 → 5786.18] I have no excuse.
[5786.48 → 5787.56] I have...
[5787.56 → 5792.14] I'm also a weird form of tall because almost all my height comes in my torso.
[5792.14 → 5793.14] Um...
[5793.14 → 5795.96] And I have very broad shoulders.
[5796.66 → 5800.40] So if I sit in a middle seat, it's actually just like rude to everyone.
[5800.70 → 5802.70] Because my shoulders will be in their seats.
[5803.18 → 5803.70] Like it...
[5803.70 → 5804.80] I cannot avoid it.
[5805.00 → 5808.94] So if there's only middle seats left in the like standard coach section,
[5809.14 → 5809.76] I'll...
[5809.76 → 5813.10] I'll often spring a little bit more to try to get in like economy plus.
[5813.20 → 5814.56] I'm never going to do business or something like that.
[5814.56 → 5815.48] I'll try to find a new flight.
[5815.48 → 5817.34] But I'll sometimes do economy plus.
[5817.92 → 5818.52] Um...
[5818.52 → 5820.50] Just to try to get out of that situation.
[5820.68 → 5823.40] I've literally had someone before who had...
[5823.40 → 5824.32] I don't remember which one it was.
[5824.38 → 5825.36] Aisle or window.
[5825.56 → 5827.08] But offered to switch with me.
[5827.28 → 5828.58] Because they're like...
[5828.58 → 5830.74] I'm assuming you'll just like lean over.
[5830.86 → 5831.34] And I was like, yeah.
[5831.42 → 5831.96] And they're like, cool.
[5832.20 → 5834.14] So I leaned over and got my shoulder out of their way.
[5834.26 → 5836.36] And I was like, I honestly appreciate that you did that.
[5836.40 → 5838.38] I did not take that in a rude way at all.
[5838.60 → 5840.10] This is just way better for everyone.
[5840.20 → 5840.50] Thank you.
[5841.06 → 5841.46] Um...
[5841.46 → 5842.10] So I don't know.
[5842.18 → 5842.74] I've done that.
[5842.74 → 5843.74] But that's like...
[5843.74 → 5844.12] I don't know.
[5844.12 → 5846.04] Maximum like 90 bucks.
[5846.88 → 5847.36] How tall are you?
[5847.40 → 5848.80] I'm not like that crazy tall.
[5849.00 → 5851.14] My torso is just pretty abnormally tall.
[5851.82 → 5852.04] Yeah.
[5852.26 → 5852.90] Um...
[5852.90 → 5854.06] Plasma Tor says...
[5854.06 → 5856.52] There's a legitimate use case for business class overseas.
[5856.52 → 5859.44] If you do it right, your first day is useful as opposed to dealing with jet lag.
[5859.46 → 5860.34] That's totally fair.
[5860.78 → 5863.58] I've always just kind of powered through it.
[5863.64 → 5870.08] But the one time I did fly business class was when I went to visit the Intel Fab.
[5870.64 → 5871.30] And that was...
[5871.30 → 5871.80] I can also sleep and coach.
[5871.80 → 5872.50] Really far.
[5872.60 → 5872.72] Yeah.
[5872.84 → 5873.72] I'll just...
[5873.72 → 5874.38] Not everyone can.
[5874.54 → 5876.66] I'll just sleep and coach, or I'll just suffer.
[5877.22 → 5877.44] Yeah.
[5877.44 → 5878.40] Um...
[5878.40 → 5879.24] I guess I've just...
[5879.24 → 5880.62] I've done it so many times.
[5881.12 → 5883.10] And I've been doing it so long at this point.
[5883.16 → 5884.16] I'm just like, yeah, okay.
[5885.12 → 5885.52] Uh...
[5885.52 → 5886.06] Here we go.
[5888.06 → 5888.42] Yeah.
[5888.48 → 5890.24] Someone in Twitch chat says, uh...
[5890.24 → 5897.36] My company owner has sprung for private jet travel a couple of times for me and my team to get to events when other stuff was going to be really, really challenging.
[5897.36 → 5897.62] Yeah.
[5897.62 → 5898.80] Sometimes there's no other options.
[5899.30 → 5902.50] And there's also a huge range in, like, private flight.
[5902.94 → 5903.32] Yeah.
[5903.32 → 5915.62] So I think that what we're talking about when we're like, no, is the like, hyper fancy, like, I have a large plane with, like, dining areas and stuff.
[5915.62 → 5916.64] Oh, that's not even what I'm talking about.
[5916.64 → 5920.34] Like, I've only flown even, like, the one that you can recline the whole way.
[5920.42 → 5924.40] Like, the kind of, like, C-shaped thing where one's facing forward, one's facing back.
[5924.44 → 5925.42] I've only done that once.
[5925.94 → 5926.52] With that said...
[5926.52 → 5928.02] No, no, because you were talking about private flight.
[5928.30 → 5928.84] Oh, oh, private.
[5928.90 → 5929.36] Oh, sorry, sorry.
[5929.40 → 5930.26] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[5931.02 → 5934.38] With that said, I have paid for private air travel.
[5937.04 → 5937.84] Not for myself.
[5938.14 → 5938.32] I'm trying to think.
[5938.38 → 5939.06] Yeah, I'm trying to think.
[5939.24 → 5939.58] What would have this been?
[5939.58 → 5942.36] And it was not for a paid event.
[5943.40 → 5945.18] It wasn't, like, for a sponsored thing.
[5945.18 → 5946.64] We didn't make any money from the event.
[5946.72 → 5947.86] We lost money on the event.
[5948.62 → 5949.96] Can you remember what it was?
[5951.10 → 5951.46] LTD?
[5951.84 → 5952.10] No.
[5952.36 → 5952.78] Oh, okay.
[5954.18 → 5955.64] There was a flood involved.
[5956.32 → 5957.82] There was a flood involved?
[5958.02 → 5960.00] Yeah, when Colton couldn't make it to the Christmas party.
[5961.68 → 5962.04] Oh!
[5964.12 → 5964.52] Yeah.
[5965.20 → 5966.90] But again, I'm going to point this out again.
[5966.90 → 5972.26] I'm sure that wasn't, like, a super fancy, like, what people are going to think of when you say private jet.
[5972.48 → 5973.22] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5973.26 → 5974.18] It's a bit different.
[5974.18 → 5977.14] And I would have done it for that Scrapyard Wars.
[5977.80 → 5979.50] That would have been sick.
[5980.38 → 5981.32] I was willing.
[5982.78 → 5983.98] That would have been awesome.
[5984.32 → 5984.50] Yeah.
[5985.20 → 5988.68] Okay, I got half a question and then a proper question.
[5988.88 → 5989.14] All right.
[5989.36 → 5993.06] For Luke, can you get more loading screens with mods on Starfield?
[5993.28 → 5993.98] Can you get more?
[5994.62 → 5995.02] More?
[5995.20 → 5996.98] We want more loading screens.
[5997.24 → 5998.46] Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised.
[5998.52 → 5999.14] Open the menu?
[5999.24 → 6000.18] Loading screen simulator.
[6000.18 → 6007.44] I was looking at this earlier in the show, but I went on Nexus mods for Starfield and looked at today's new mods.
[6007.50 → 6009.08] So mods in the last 24 hours.
[6009.20 → 6010.88] And there has been 106.
[6011.50 → 6012.80] Yeah, I told you they'd be fast.
[6013.38 → 6014.20] It's crazy.
[6014.20 → 6015.18] Are there any bird mods?
[6015.34 → 6015.60] No.
[6015.74 → 6015.92] Oh.
[6015.92 → 6024.14] Joel's 13 says, if you ever want to try it without spending a ton or feeling bad about the environmental impact, look up empty leg flights.
[6024.52 → 6026.70] It's where a private plane needs to get somewhere.
[6026.84 → 6028.52] So they just fly the plane there.
[6030.08 → 6030.44] Oh.
[6030.66 → 6031.68] Yeah, I've never heard of that before.
[6031.88 → 6032.22] Me neither.
[6032.30 → 6032.98] But that makes sense.
[6032.98 → 6035.24] I'd be super down to try something like that.
[6035.50 → 6035.70] Yeah.
[6035.78 → 6035.96] Yeah.
[6036.56 → 6040.52] I'm sure there's like travel YouTubers and stuff who have done videos about that sort of thing.
[6040.52 → 6041.66] I still just, I don't care.
[6043.10 → 6043.50] Personally.
[6043.90 → 6044.40] I don't know.
[6044.80 → 6045.08] I don't know.
[6045.18 → 6045.64] It's you.
[6045.84 → 6046.18] Okay.
[6046.36 → 6046.80] Hold on.
[6047.10 → 6048.98] I'm going to, I'm going to convince you.
[6049.26 → 6049.60] Okay.
[6049.74 → 6051.56] I'm going to give myself one minute to convince you.
[6051.62 → 6054.20] Actually, I'm going to give myself about 10, 10 seconds to convince you.
[6054.30 → 6054.56] Okay.
[6054.56 → 6057.52] One of the big things for you is experiences.
[6057.82 → 6058.00] Yeah.
[6058.14 → 6063.70] And I think that you would enjoy that experience if you shared it with your family.
[6063.78 → 6064.42] Damn it.
[6064.56 → 6064.92] Got him.
[6065.30 → 6066.52] Oh, I felt that.
[6066.66 → 6068.76] I felt, I felt it hit him.
[6068.76 → 6069.18] Damn it.
[6069.28 → 6070.24] I felt that.
[6071.30 → 6072.50] God, you're good at this, Linus.
[6072.58 → 6073.58] See, this is the problem.
[6073.58 → 6076.06] When you know someone this well.
[6076.72 → 6078.34] Oh, that was brutal.
[6079.12 → 6082.58] The problem is that when you know someone this well,
[6082.58 → 6088.08] you can only, you can only achieve that if you also open yourself up.
[6088.26 → 6090.32] So he can hit me just as hard.
[6090.58 → 6092.18] I just have to wait for it.
[6095.52 → 6098.02] Oh, yeah, that's a that's a pretty fair one.
[6098.18 → 6098.54] All right.
[6098.62 → 6098.84] Okay.
[6098.92 → 6100.34] Last, last actual question.
[6100.56 → 6100.98] Yeah.
[6100.98 → 6102.32] Hello, fellow techs.
[6102.50 → 6106.60] With NVIDIA being less and less interested to invest in the gaming space,
[6106.60 → 6112.40] how long do you think it will get before they start charging a monthly fee for using Dislike technology?
[6112.40 → 6114.92] Why do they know me so much, so well?
[6115.10 → 6118.30] They know how to just make me not want to do this anymore.
[6119.18 → 6123.46] I not, I not only don't want to talk on WAN Show anymore, I don't want to talk about that.
[6123.70 → 6125.12] I don't want to face that.
[6125.32 → 6127.08] I actually almost wish that was never asked.
[6127.10 → 6128.70] Luke, I don't want to have to make that video.
[6129.06 → 6129.34] Yeah.
[6129.74 → 6130.84] I don't want to cover it.
[6130.84 → 6140.12] Watching the, the donut media team address the like subscription seat, subscription seat warmers was like painful for, I think the exact same reason.
[6140.12 → 6146.72] There is, I think that sometimes I've seen it many times over the years.
[6147.36 → 6157.02] The general viewer, or at least some subset of the general viewer seems to think that we have some kind of power that we don't have.
[6157.02 → 6165.36] You know whether it's overpriced GPUs or like under spec, like, oh, if only you guys complained about it more, you could get this changed.
[6165.54 → 6167.34] We can't change anything.
[6167.34 → 6183.54] And it's honestly, it makes our impotence feel all the more frustrating because there's at least a subset of you guys who want this from us, who want us to wield this enormous club that you feel like we have for this industry-wide change at the most.
[6183.72 → 6187.58] We can affect policy within a department at some of these companies or something like that.
[6187.58 → 6189.90] But you have to understand they're publicly held.
[6190.58 → 6194.04] They answer to one entity, the shareholder.
[6194.36 → 6195.36] That's it.
[6195.36 → 6200.26] So if people will buy this, then they're going to pump it out.
[6200.98 → 6212.32] And it's like, sorry, I'm not meaning to like, I'm not meaning to go off on this or anything, but it's so frustrating because we're just watching this slow motion burning train crash.
[6215.00 → 6221.64] And it's like the extra weight of the expectation that we can do something about it.
[6221.84 → 6223.70] It's all the more frustrating.
[6223.70 → 6225.96] I hate it just as much as you guys.
[6226.12 → 6228.30] And I hate that you're probably right.
[6229.12 → 6235.52] It is a matter of time until there is a subscription tier GPU feature.
[6235.72 → 6236.62] And you know what?
[6237.00 → 6238.86] It's not going to start on GeForce.
[6238.86 → 6240.42] It's not going to start with the LSS.
[6240.74 → 6241.56] RTX 7090 with premium.
[6241.82 → 6242.80] It's going to start.
[6242.80 → 6246.82] Well, it's already starting with the data centre grade stuff.
[6247.04 → 6249.92] And then it's going to make its way into the workstation.
[6250.06 → 6252.80] And then it's going to make its way into consumer.
[6252.98 → 6257.30] It's already there if you pay for a GPU as a service like GeForce now.
[6257.88 → 6263.82] But it's a matter of time before it makes it into the card that you supposedly own.
[6263.82 → 6265.88] Sorry.
[6266.04 → 6267.22] This is a thing.
[6271.14 → 6271.58] Anyway.
[6271.76 → 6271.92] Sorry.
[6272.04 → 6272.22] Yes.
[6272.30 → 6272.58] Go ahead.
[6274.02 → 6275.54] Do you think you can push a boycott?
[6275.62 → 6275.72] Yeah.
[6275.74 → 6277.84] I'm going to convince gamers to stop playing games.
[6278.00 → 6280.96] Just like we convince people to stop paying for microtransactions.
[6281.42 → 6283.56] Just like we convince people to stop pre-ordering.
[6284.16 → 6285.20] It doesn't matter.
[6285.20 → 6290.18] Cromwell on X or Twitter.
[6290.54 → 6294.60] The director of publishing at Larian Studios recently was in a thread talking about this.
[6294.70 → 6299.82] And I strongly agree when it comes to Game Pass style subscriptions.
[6300.62 → 6302.66] So accessing video games.
[6302.92 → 6304.50] Not the NVIDIA GeForce one.
[6304.68 → 6308.64] But just like the Xbox One or PlayStation One or whatever.
[6309.00 → 6309.92] Origin has one.
[6310.00 → 6310.70] I think Play has one.
[6310.78 → 6310.96] Whatever.
[6310.96 → 6311.08] Whatever.
[6312.46 → 6317.16] Where they were basically saying if you can afford it.
[6317.68 → 6319.18] Which is a pretty big caveat.
[6319.34 → 6321.14] But if you can afford it just buy the games outright.
[6321.90 → 6324.40] Because one of the issues with these subscription services.
[6324.60 → 6326.84] And I brought this argument up recently to someone.
[6326.92 → 6327.44] I don't remember who.
[6327.56 → 6328.54] But they were like hey no.
[6328.78 → 6330.72] Like I know some game developers.
[6331.02 → 6332.34] And they make some good money.
[6332.60 → 6334.24] If they get onto one of these services.
[6334.44 → 6335.20] Like it's a good payday.
[6335.68 → 6338.70] The problem is when these things become ubiquitous.
[6338.70 → 6342.26] Then the four or five companies that run them.
[6344.02 → 6344.90] Run everything.
[6345.22 → 6347.08] And now they can dictate all the terms.
[6347.58 → 6348.08] I believe.
[6348.10 → 6349.02] Love that Freudian slip.
[6349.22 → 6355.92] I believe recently Microsoft and PlayStation have cut their payments to.
[6356.06 → 6357.26] I believe it's just indie developers.
[6357.36 → 6358.56] But it might be developers overall.
[6359.22 → 6362.82] Like the only reason why they can do that is because they're not worried about it.
[6362.88 → 6363.78] They like upped their prices.
[6363.78 → 6366.26] And cut their payments to indie developers at the same time.
[6366.26 → 6372.18] And you saw Microsoft change the terms of their trial for Games Pass.
[6372.52 → 6374.22] In the lead up to Starfield.
[6374.62 → 6374.80] Yeah.
[6375.02 → 6375.64] So it's like.
[6376.06 → 6376.58] And it's like.
[6376.80 → 6376.94] Yeah.
[6377.02 → 6378.82] That's well within their rights to do.
[6379.02 → 6381.28] And what if your favourite game gets taken off of it.
[6381.54 → 6382.80] And at the same time.
[6382.86 → 6385.06] What if it gets taken off of one of these subscription services.
[6385.58 → 6385.98] Years.
[6386.38 → 6387.04] After proof.
[6387.16 → 6388.08] It's in Game Link.
[6388.14 → 6388.80] Go watch Game Link.
[6388.88 → 6390.04] I'm sure it's cited there somehow.
[6390.04 → 6393.34] But the.
[6394.52 → 6398.12] If this game that you love is taken off of these services.
[6398.46 → 6401.28] And also isn't currently for sale on any of the stores.
[6401.56 → 6402.78] It's just gone.
[6403.20 → 6404.66] We're seeing this happen with.
[6404.88 → 6405.36] With.
[6405.56 → 6405.76] With.
[6406.20 → 6407.12] Web video.
[6407.24 → 6407.72] Web movies.
[6408.02 → 6408.46] Right now.
[6409.12 → 6410.74] Like Netflix style platforms.
[6410.74 → 6411.24] Where they are.
[6411.34 → 6413.26] They're taking things off of the platform.
[6413.44 → 6415.00] In order to get a tax write off on it.
[6415.16 → 6417.22] But that means you don't have access to it anymore.
[6417.70 → 6418.38] And yeah.
[6418.50 → 6418.74] Sure.
[6418.80 → 6419.56] It got taken off the platform.
[6419.70 → 6420.38] Maybe it wasn't that good.
[6420.50 → 6421.52] But maybe you liked it.
[6422.64 → 6423.26] So like.
[6423.54 → 6423.90] Man.
[6423.96 → 6424.50] That sucks.
[6424.64 → 6424.76] I.
[6424.96 → 6425.62] I don't know.
[6425.76 → 6427.18] I don't subscribe to any of these things.
[6427.26 → 6427.70] And I know.
[6427.82 → 6428.20] I'm a.
[6428.22 → 6428.70] I'm a.
[6428.78 → 6429.26] Old school.
[6429.36 → 6430.96] I want physical versions of my games' person.
[6431.04 → 6432.34] But this is almost a different argument.
[6432.72 → 6435.14] This has actually nothing to do with physical versions of games.
[6435.14 → 6436.86] This has a mixture of things to do with.
[6437.22 → 6437.58] Wanting.
[6438.88 → 6439.28] The.
[6439.46 → 6439.64] The.
[6439.78 → 6440.18] No.
[6440.64 → 6441.34] Hoping that.
[6441.86 → 6443.80] I'm taking a little bit less control.
[6444.04 → 6444.98] Away from the subscription.
[6445.00 → 6445.40] Services.
[6445.74 → 6447.68] And making it so that developers have a little bit more.
[6447.86 → 6448.82] Because I think that's important.
[6449.10 → 6450.30] There's a relationship there.
[6450.34 → 6450.50] Right.
[6450.54 → 6451.28] They need the platform.
[6451.42 → 6452.34] Steam is really important.
[6452.68 → 6453.74] These other things are really important.
[6453.86 → 6455.56] They need a storefront to be able to sell their games through.
[6455.78 → 6457.58] Everyone just selling their games through their own websites.
[6457.58 → 6458.86] Is not going to be great.
[6459.10 → 6459.90] It works for some people.
[6459.96 → 6460.76] It's not going to work for everyone.
[6461.00 → 6461.14] And.
[6461.28 → 6462.32] But the cuts are rough.
[6462.32 → 6464.60] And to people saying that piracy is the answer.
[6464.80 → 6466.46] Here's the problem with that argument.
[6467.04 → 6468.14] Piracy is the answer.
[6468.28 → 6470.34] As long as formats exist.
[6470.68 → 6471.76] That can be pirated.
[6472.18 → 6473.54] All they have to do.
[6473.54 → 6476.48] Is basically decide as an industry.
[6476.98 → 6478.18] It's all game streaming now.
[6478.24 → 6478.38] Yeah.
[6478.44 → 6478.90] You know what?
[6478.96 → 6479.76] These games.
[6480.72 → 6483.38] We're just never going to make the files available.
[6483.70 → 6484.76] For anyone to download.
[6484.90 → 6486.04] There will be nothing to.
[6486.18 → 6488.06] There will be nothing to reverse engineer.
[6488.32 → 6489.82] And there will be leaks occasionally.
[6490.12 → 6492.12] I mean we saw that giant dump out of Nintendo.
[6492.12 → 6494.78] But almost literally everything that came out of that.
[6494.88 → 6496.12] Was like 20 years old.
[6496.22 → 6497.70] Like you are not going to be just.
[6497.70 → 6499.64] Playing pirated games.
[6499.64 → 6502.88] That were only ever installed in a data centre.
[6502.88 → 6504.54] That was NDA'd up the butt.
[6505.26 → 6506.98] You know six months after release.
[6506.98 → 6508.02] Or anything like that.
[6508.48 → 6508.68] Or.
[6509.44 → 6511.22] Or they can collectively just decide.
[6511.28 → 6511.56] You know what?
[6511.58 → 6512.38] It's just not worth it.
[6512.38 → 6513.92] If people are just going to pirate this stuff.
[6514.28 → 6515.96] And people might turn to piracy.
[6515.96 → 6517.74] If they start making everything a subscription.
[6517.98 → 6519.54] So it becomes this arms race.
[6519.54 → 6519.76] Right?
[6519.82 → 6520.34] Where they kind of go.
[6520.44 → 6520.52] Okay.
[6520.52 → 6522.20] Well then we're just only going to develop games.
[6522.36 → 6524.04] That are hyper reliant.
[6524.20 → 6525.98] On the always online.
[6527.04 → 6529.10] Always online sort of community features.
[6529.16 → 6530.98] And that's something we've already seen.
[6531.14 → 6531.30] Yeah.
[6531.32 → 6533.88] Where you've got this like multiplayers.
[6533.88 → 6536.04] Kind of cloud functionality.
[6536.42 → 6538.40] That's just kind of shoehorned into games.
[6538.58 → 6541.14] That honestly didn't need it.
[6541.14 → 6543.82] But then suffer a degraded gaming experience.
[6544.10 → 6544.54] If you are.
[6544.98 → 6546.32] If you don't have them.
[6546.44 → 6547.66] At least for some people.
[6548.20 → 6548.40] You know.
[6548.44 → 6549.82] Even if it's something as simple as.
[6549.82 → 6551.74] You know people just like leaving comments behind.
[6551.86 → 6552.52] That you can find.
[6553.74 → 6554.10] Um.
[6555.48 → 6555.68] Yeah.
[6555.72 → 6555.98] I don't know.
[6556.00 → 6556.84] It's just like we talked about.
[6556.88 → 6558.36] I think we talked about this last week.
[6558.46 → 6559.06] How I was saying.
[6559.14 → 6561.20] I'm like worried about the future of movies.
[6561.34 → 6562.42] Did we talk about that?
[6562.50 → 6562.98] I think we did.
[6563.38 → 6563.86] I think so.
[6564.00 → 6565.78] I'm worried about the future of gaming too.
[6565.90 → 6566.18] Which is.
[6566.22 → 6566.40] Yeah.
[6566.48 → 6567.78] Which is like kind of crazy.
[6568.12 → 6568.70] Which is weird because we're like getting.
[6568.96 → 6570.56] We're coming out of a rough era.
[6570.66 → 6572.18] Into a very good era right now.
[6572.32 → 6573.48] And I will also say.
[6573.70 → 6575.96] One of the great things about this current era.
[6576.16 → 6577.88] Is a lot of these games have.
[6577.88 → 6580.58] Very acceptable monetization setups.
[6581.36 → 6582.42] Which is interesting.
[6583.24 → 6584.24] Because for a while there.
[6584.34 → 6586.04] Like remember the battlefront era.
[6587.18 → 6587.58] When like.
[6587.90 → 6588.74] What was it?
[6588.78 → 6590.24] It would cost you like a hundred grand.
[6590.30 → 6591.08] To unlock all the characters.
[6591.30 → 6591.62] Or no.
[6591.70 → 6593.06] It was like a hundred thousand hours of gameplay.
[6593.18 → 6594.32] I don't remember what it was.
[6594.36 → 6594.96] I don't remember the quote.
[6595.30 → 6595.58] But it's like.
[6595.58 → 6596.24] Pride and accomplishment.
[6596.64 → 6596.84] Yeah.
[6596.84 → 6599.36] It's like one of the most upvoted things on Reddit ever.
[6599.62 → 6600.16] Or downvoted.
[6600.36 → 6600.46] Down.
[6600.58 → 6601.66] Like six hundred thousand or something.
[6601.82 → 6601.98] Yeah.
[6602.04 → 6602.20] Sure.
[6602.28 → 6602.46] Whatever.
[6602.56 → 6602.84] I don't know.
[6603.10 → 6603.50] It's been a while.
[6603.82 → 6604.86] But like we came from that.
[6604.94 → 6605.76] Into where we currently are.
[6605.82 → 6606.34] Which is great.
[6607.10 → 6609.28] But because we're in a great spot right now.
[6609.46 → 6611.58] Doesn't guarantee that we'll be in a good spot in the future.
[6612.20 → 6612.44] Yeah.
[6612.54 → 6613.82] And I don't know everything about the games' industry.
[6613.88 → 6614.38] I'm not in it.
[6614.44 → 6617.42] It doesn't even mean that we're in as good a spot as we think we are now.
[6617.42 → 6631.24] I mean one of the first things that you were saying about the splash screen when you jump into Starfield is that they've got that box sitting there that is obviously a placeholder to get you used to seeing something there so they can start selling you horse armour.
[6631.36 → 6634.40] Let's not forget who started this whole bloody thing.
[6635.50 → 6636.36] Horse armour.
[6637.72 → 6638.58] Never forget.
[6640.52 → 6640.96] Bethesda.
[6641.14 → 6643.98] I know like Mark Curran popped off on this.
[6643.98 → 6654.92] I don't know if it was because of what it looked like or if it was because of this thing in the corner because I honestly didn't pay attention to that conversation because I didn't care because I think it looks fine.
[6655.16 → 6662.62] But this welcome to Starfield square in the corner, mark my words, will be used to sell things.
[6666.32 → 6668.50] I hate that you're right.
[6668.68 → 6669.40] I hate that.
[6669.40 → 6670.36] I promise you.
[6671.96 → 6672.88] It's going to happen.
[6672.88 → 6676.56] Some DLC is going to come out or something.
[6676.64 → 6677.68] Something's going to be available.
[6677.90 → 6678.38] I don't know.
[6679.80 → 6680.80] Just mod it out.
[6680.98 → 6681.20] Yeah.
[6684.16 → 6685.64] It's the solution to everything.
[6686.72 → 6688.08] Add a loading screen to it.
[6688.60 → 6688.86] Yeah.
[6689.10 → 6689.28] Yeah.
[6690.86 → 6692.60] Can I just shout out Twitch chat?
[6692.60 → 6698.04] Someone is gifting subs to people who have usernames that insult me.
[6698.04 → 6703.56] If that's how you guys want to express your hate, I'm super into it.
[6707.06 → 6708.10] That's pretty funny.
[6711.60 → 6713.70] You guys really are something else, Twitch chat.
[6715.32 → 6718.36] Lenovo announces the Legion Go handheld.
[6718.36 → 6718.86] Yeah.
[6718.98 → 6724.60] It's to be released in October and highlights include an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme with integrated graphics.
[6724.70 → 6726.48] So this is just like the DOG Ally.
[6726.82 → 6728.94] A starting price of $699.
[6730.28 → 6735.98] However, it's 799 euros in Europe, which is closer to 860 US dollars.
[6736.04 → 6738.16] A little weird.
[6738.16 → 6740.14] Maybe this indicates that it'll be a higher spec.
[6740.24 → 6742.40] Maybe this is a VAT included price.
[6742.68 → 6743.80] Not 100% sure.
[6744.64 → 6747.42] Anywho, 49.2.
[6747.48 → 6748.42] This says hours.
[6748.58 → 6754.40] I'm sure it means William hours compared to the Allies 40, which would be nice.
[6754.54 → 6755.60] I've been using my...
[6755.60 → 6755.62] Watt hours.
[6756.20 → 6756.74] Oh, watt-hours.
[6756.92 → 6759.58] Oh, that would be a lot higher if it was William hours.
[6759.96 → 6762.54] 49.2 watt-hours.
[6762.64 → 6763.22] I think it's big.
[6763.46 → 6763.76] Whatever.
[6763.86 → 6764.20] It doesn't matter.
[6764.28 → 6765.28] No one's going to look at this dock again.
[6766.46 → 6767.46] That'd be a big improvement.
[6767.46 → 6772.82] I've been using the Ally a lot lately to play Chained Echoes.
[6773.96 → 6778.86] And I have found the battery life affecting my habits.
[6779.08 → 6780.90] Like I will play...
[6780.90 → 6781.54] Do you play in bed?
[6781.74 → 6782.64] I play in bed a lot, yeah.
[6783.08 → 6783.84] I'm a bed player.
[6784.30 → 6785.14] This makes a lot more sense.
[6786.12 → 6788.38] Just timeline-wise of when you log into that game.
[6788.48 → 6788.98] I'm like, okay.
[6790.04 → 6792.80] Well, I'm like always logged into that game because I just leave it running.
[6792.88 → 6796.48] My son was making fun of me for taking over 100 hours to beat the game.
[6796.48 → 6798.96] And I'm just like, son.
[6799.52 → 6804.38] I have put like less than half of that into it because I just like fall asleep, and it's just like lying there.
[6804.50 → 6804.98] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6804.98 → 6805.16] It doesn't matter.
[6806.80 → 6807.12] Anywho.
[6807.34 → 6807.78] I was...
[6807.78 → 6807.96] Sorry.
[6808.12 → 6808.66] I just...
[6808.66 → 6811.26] I fell asleep playing Slay the Spire on my phone.
[6811.84 → 6814.18] And my hand was like out like this.
[6814.48 → 6818.48] And I woke up with my hand still propped up with the phone still in it.
[6818.48 → 6821.08] And my girlfriend said like, yeah, I saw you like that.
[6821.10 → 6821.82] I just thought it was funny.
[6821.88 → 6822.66] I just left it there.
[6824.60 → 6826.30] Did she at least plug it into the charger?
[6826.78 → 6827.04] No.
[6827.16 → 6829.64] Well, it eventually like went to sleep and was fine.
[6829.74 → 6831.50] It didn't keep the game running the whole time.
[6831.50 → 6834.98] But yeah, I was...
[6834.98 → 6839.80] When I woke up and my hand was still like that, I thought I just dozed off for a second and went to go like put it on the charger.
[6839.90 → 6843.20] But I realized it was like the morning and I needed to get up.
[6844.82 → 6845.78] I thought that was pretty funny.
[6845.94 → 6846.20] Anyway.
[6846.20 → 6849.16] The screen is huge.
[6851.42 → 6853.00] This is wild.
[6853.14 → 6855.88] It has an 8.8 inch display.
[6856.80 → 6859.70] So this thing is going to be flipping enormous.
[6859.92 → 6861.28] I hadn't actually looked at this yet.
[6861.36 → 6861.46] Yeah.
[6861.50 → 6862.88] Like look at the...
[6862.88 → 6867.06] Why wouldn't they just put bigger, you know, buttons on it at that point?
[6867.42 → 6870.44] Those look even like full size joysticks like the Steam Deck.
[6870.50 → 6871.84] In fact, those look like touchpads.
[6872.02 → 6873.00] Like, oh no, just one.
[6873.66 → 6874.80] It does look like a touchpad.
[6874.80 → 6875.48] One touchpad.
[6875.48 → 6880.14] I guess that would be convenient for navigation even if you can't use it for gaming like you can on the Steam Deck.
[6880.24 → 6880.88] I'd like that, yeah.
[6880.96 → 6881.16] Why not?
[6881.26 → 6881.38] Yeah.
[6881.42 → 6883.22] I mean, you could use it for certain kinds of games.
[6883.24 → 6884.82] You play like a city builder game or whatever else.
[6884.86 → 6890.12] I mean, you can't use them as like a dual sticks replacement like you can on the Steam Deck.
[6891.92 → 6895.10] The resolution of the display is 2560 by 1600.
[6895.28 → 6897.44] It runs it up to 144 hertz.
[6897.72 → 6904.74] It has two USB 4 ports which may or may not allow you to connect an external GPU.
[6905.48 → 6912.44] Support for GPU on USB 4 devices is a little bit hit or miss.
[6912.44 → 6914.72] I am liking the price.
[6914.72 → 6918.84] 16 gigs of RAM, 256 to 1 terabyte Gen 4 SSD.
[6920.12 → 6923.98] Discussion question here is are we about to see real competition in the gaming handheld space?
[6925.58 → 6926.48] I'm going to say no.
[6930.22 → 6930.62] Really?
[6930.62 → 6930.66] Really?
[6931.00 → 6931.24] Yeah.
[6931.62 → 6931.98] Why?
[6932.22 → 6934.52] Because nobody is competing with the Steam Deck right now.
[6935.06 → 6935.56] Oh, okay.
[6936.32 → 6938.34] Do you guys see the price of those return Steam Decks?
[6938.42 → 6939.64] By the way, dang it, Austin.
[6940.86 → 6943.92] Austin Evans' video on return Steam Decks.
[6944.90 → 6951.44] Basically, not only did a video on return Steam Decks, but we had an idea to have kind of like a more complete angle on it.
[6951.44 → 6955.54] And like do a bunch of upgrades to it with the money that you saved.
[6955.88 → 6957.66] And he did the same bloody thing.
[6958.40 → 6961.88] So anyway, we're going to try and do even more upgrades because whatever.
[6962.04 → 6962.72] F*** you, Austin.
[6963.18 → 6963.60] Just kidding.
[6963.74 → 6964.70] I love Austin.
[6966.20 → 6969.74] But yeah, we're going to try and do even more upgrades to our Steam Deck.
[6969.74 → 6976.16] He was on Kyle's podcast, and he was saying that he gets recognized as you like all the time.
[6976.42 → 6976.78] Really?
[6977.00 → 6977.98] He says it drives him nuts.
[6979.02 → 6979.74] I don't have a beard.
[6981.58 → 6982.84] Yeah, but you didn't use to.
[6983.12 → 6987.04] So he was also at the same time talking about how one of the worst things for people to say when they meet him is,
[6987.16 → 6988.28] I used to watch your videos.
[6989.36 → 6992.16] Oh, what about my boyfriend watches your videos?
[6992.22 → 6993.44] Because that's the one I usually get.
[6997.16 → 6998.42] I don't mind that one.
[6998.42 → 6999.82] Why do you not like that?
[6999.82 → 7004.30] Oh, it's just the thing people always say to me.
[7004.58 → 7005.76] So it's like predictable.
[7006.78 → 7009.96] It's like, tell me something I'm not expecting to hear, I guess.
[7010.94 → 7012.30] It's not upsetting or anything.
[7012.36 → 7013.42] I know what our demographics are.
[7014.94 → 7016.14] It's just always funny.
[7016.38 → 7024.70] So anytime someone who identifies as a woman walks up to me,
[7025.28 → 7027.00] I'll start counting down.
[7027.00 → 7029.10] I'll be like, five, four, three, two.
[7029.36 → 7030.60] My boyfriend loves your videos.
[7030.82 → 7033.14] But it's not always that way, and it's pretty cool when it's not.
[7033.22 → 7033.74] No, it's not.
[7033.78 → 7034.88] No, it's not always that way.
[7034.96 → 7036.90] But it very, very often is.
[7036.90 → 7043.38] One of almost the thing Austin said, but not quite ones,
[7043.84 → 7045.30] when people walk up to me is,
[7045.82 → 7050.04] I used your guide when I built my first PC.
[7050.54 → 7053.22] But they don't really remember my name or anything.
[7053.50 → 7054.86] They just kind of recognize me.
[7054.86 → 7055.42] That's so cool, though.
[7055.52 → 7055.70] Right.
[7055.76 → 7057.68] But they probably haven't watched in three or four years.
[7057.78 → 7057.96] Yeah.
[7058.26 → 7060.44] Because we don't really do PC build guides anymore.
[7060.56 → 7060.86] I don't know.
[7060.86 → 7063.56] I think I get recognized a lot less than you guys.
[7063.72 → 7065.80] So none of the responses really bother me much.
[7066.06 → 7068.38] I also like, I'm not on camera anymore.
[7068.52 → 7071.42] So people couldn't really say that they still watch me now,
[7071.44 → 7072.62] unless it's just WAN show, right?
[7073.24 → 7074.30] So like, I don't know.
[7074.46 → 7076.24] A shocking number of people watch WAN show.
[7077.12 → 7077.64] Yeah, that's true.
[7077.98 → 7079.46] It's like, I was trying to figure this out.
[7079.46 → 7082.12] I don't know if I've talked about this on WAN show yet,
[7082.22 → 7087.50] but I was really trying to figure out why I was getting so much attention at LTX.
[7088.20 → 7088.88] WAN show.
[7089.00 → 7089.56] WAN show.
[7089.90 → 7094.50] And the like most hardcore viewers are going to be WAN show viewers.
[7094.74 → 7098.60] I didn't necessarily put together the connection between hardcore viewers and WAN show viewers.
[7099.00 → 7101.10] I knew WAN show viewers, if people are going to recognize me,
[7101.14 → 7101.80] it's probably going to be WAN show.
[7101.86 → 7102.38] I knew that.
[7102.80 → 7105.56] But I didn't really put together that if they go to LTX,
[7105.84 → 7107.36] they very likely watch WAN show.
[7107.86 → 7109.16] So I was like, oh, okay.
[7109.16 → 7109.42] Yeah.
[7109.46 → 7112.74] Do you have any idea like what percentage of LTX tickets were sold
[7112.74 → 7114.34] when we like talked about it on WAN shows?
[7114.40 → 7114.74] Oh no.
[7115.04 → 7115.74] Yeah, it's a lot.
[7116.06 → 7116.24] Yeah.
[7116.64 → 7118.60] It's not like all of them or anything like that.
[7118.66 → 7119.92] Like it's not, it's not like that.
[7120.02 → 7123.56] Some people, the WAN show format is just too long.
[7124.10 → 7125.02] I get it.
[7125.10 → 7126.48] I had, I had a hundred percent.
[7126.60 → 7129.00] This was actually technically someone who was running a booth.
[7130.54 → 7133.48] But I had a line form in front of their booth.
[7133.48 → 7138.00] And then when I left, I like apologized to them
[7138.00 → 7140.36] for making their booth a little bit harder to get to for a little while
[7140.36 → 7141.54] and like talk to them for a second.
[7141.96 → 7145.82] And the guy was like, yeah, so like, what's it like working for Linus Media Group?
[7146.00 → 7146.46] And I was like,
[7147.46 → 7150.62] it's pretty cool.
[7150.62 → 7155.04] It was like, was talking to me as if I was like a very new employee.
[7155.24 → 7157.74] I was like, wow, this is, this is kind of awkward, but.
[7157.88 → 7158.88] If I didn't like it, I wouldn't.
[7159.38 → 7159.74] Yeah.
[7160.70 → 7163.00] I sort of, sort of been here for a while.
[7163.14 → 7163.94] Yeah, I don't know.
[7164.08 → 7164.58] That's okay.
[7164.66 → 7169.94] I mean, other than that Linus guy is like determined to like crash the company into,
[7170.08 → 7171.04] into the ground.
[7172.70 → 7173.96] It's a lot of stress.
[7173.96 → 7176.80] Otherwise it's okay.
[7177.08 → 7179.34] Just start screaming more progressively loudly.
[7179.46 → 7180.22] The people are great.
[7180.34 → 7182.38] I like hanging out in the fishbowl with Dan.
[7182.58 → 7183.62] It's really fun.
[7186.70 → 7187.42] Oh man.
[7187.92 → 7188.32] Anyway.
[7188.32 → 7188.70] Oh man.
[7188.78 → 7190.00] So yeah, you don't think competition?
[7190.36 → 7191.32] No, I just, I.
[7191.52 → 7193.10] The Steam Deck's just stomping?
[7193.20 → 7195.60] I think the I think the Steam Deck is stomping.
[7195.80 → 7195.96] I mean.
[7195.96 → 7197.12] Why do you like the ally more than?
[7197.78 → 7198.86] Oh, it's way more powerful.
[7199.38 → 7200.72] And, and as a tinkerer.
[7200.72 → 7202.02] How much does the Steam Deck cost?
[7202.28 → 7205.02] The, the refers are like $329, Luke.
[7205.28 → 7205.72] Whoa.
[7206.06 → 7206.48] Yeah.
[7208.44 → 7211.70] They're like dangerously close to Switch Lite.
[7212.26 → 7213.82] That's actually, wow.
[7213.82 → 7214.00] Yeah.
[7214.06 → 7216.66] And when you consider the, the, the cheapness of games.
[7216.66 → 7218.56] It's still $500 Canadian because our dollar sucks.
[7218.58 → 7218.78] Right?
[7218.86 → 7219.78] Compared to Nintendo.
[7220.08 → 7224.72] The lifetime cost of this thing is, it's, it's, it's way less, right?
[7225.28 → 7226.88] The Steam Deck is incredible.
[7227.10 → 7228.56] I wish it was more powerful.
[7228.56 → 7235.80] I wish that Valve had, I wish that Valve had adopted a model of iterating on it more frequently.
[7236.26 → 7244.68] The fact that they've decided to treat it less like a PC and more like a console in terms of its life cycle makes sense.
[7244.92 → 7248.40] But I would have liked to see rapid fire iteration.
[7248.40 → 7262.62] But other than that, I just, I think it is so close to most of what people, many people need that it just, it kind of irrelevance everything else at that price point.
[7262.62 → 7269.36] Because let's talk about some of the games that, that, you know, you're, you're excited about that have come out over the last year or so.
[7269.36 → 7269.58] Right?
[7269.58 → 7272.50] Like, sure, you've got your, you've got your star fields.
[7272.68 → 7274.90] You're not going to be playing that on a Steam Deck.
[7275.04 → 7276.32] I've heard it's a pretty bad experience.
[7276.34 → 7277.60] You're not going to play it on an ally either.
[7277.96 → 7278.18] Yeah.
[7278.32 → 7279.54] So, okay, whatever.
[7279.76 → 7280.84] Like they're, I see your point.
[7280.88 → 7289.74] They're in the same class of hardware where you can play older AAA games, or you can play newer ones.
[7289.74 → 7290.46] Kind of.
[7290.86 → 7291.58] Here's a question.
[7291.72 → 7294.12] If you were going to get the premium Steam Deck.
[7294.24 → 7295.14] But Dave the Diver.
[7296.00 → 7296.18] Yeah.
[7296.38 → 7296.62] Okay.
[7297.10 → 7297.92] Sea of Stars.
[7297.92 → 7298.44] Sea of Stars.
[7298.58 → 7302.48] You play the crap out of those regardless of whether it's a Steam Deck or an ally or whatever else.
[7302.58 → 7302.70] Yeah.
[7302.78 → 7302.96] Okay.
[7303.02 → 7303.26] So, sorry.
[7303.32 → 7303.66] What were you saying?
[7303.68 → 7304.50] The premium Steam Deck.
[7304.58 → 7306.20] The premium Steam Deck is pretty expensive.
[7306.78 → 7310.98] Would you do ally or this go thing, or would you do premium Steam Deck?
[7311.50 → 7313.46] I would, I mean, I've already told you.
[7313.56 → 7316.90] I would go ally regardless because I want the extra performance.
[7317.08 → 7319.16] I also like the form factor of the allay better.
[7319.16 → 7321.28] I don't like how gigantic the Steam Deck is.
[7321.38 → 7322.76] So, I feel like the.
[7323.54 → 7325.24] I also like the 120 hertz display.
[7325.56 → 7329.20] Hey, if I can run the game smoothly, I'd like to.
[7329.22 → 7332.06] Because the premium Steam Deck is 820 Canadian.
[7332.34 → 7337.92] But, but because the Steam Deck is so user serviceable, you don't have to buy that.
[7338.64 → 7343.22] Buy the cheapest return you can and then Huck a big SSD in it.
[7343.60 → 7346.34] A better screen, anti-glare glass.
[7346.34 → 7348.56] It does, but you don't need that.
[7349.16 → 7349.62] Yeah, fair enough.
[7349.74 → 7353.76] Yeah, it's a little bit better for glare, but it's like, it's not a night and day difference.
[7353.82 → 7356.92] You can go back, and you can watch the original hands-on that we did down in Seattle.
[7357.12 → 7363.48] It's, yeah, it's better, but it's not even better in a this is better and everyone should get it kind of way.
[7363.54 → 7365.16] It's kind of a personal preference sort of better.
[7365.26 → 7365.70] Okay, yeah.
[7365.70 → 7368.22] So, no, I don't think that's a big deal.
[7368.22 → 7369.38] So, yeah.
[7369.80 → 7377.62] If, if I, if I wanted, if I wanted the best possible entry into handheld gaming, I'm buying a return Steam Deck, and I'm putting a big fat SSD in it.
[7377.88 → 7379.64] And I'm calling it, I'm calling it a day.
[7379.68 → 7388.56] I'm going to go spend my money on a bunch of great, fun, you know, indie games or, or, or lighter games or older games.
[7388.56 → 7393.16] And I'm going to play the crap out of that thing because at the end of the day, it's not about the hardware.
[7393.46 → 7394.16] Here's a counterargument.
[7394.28 → 7395.36] It's about the games.
[7395.56 → 7398.24] Every single return Steam Deck is sold out.
[7398.88 → 7399.62] Oh, really?
[7399.90 → 7400.10] Yes.
[7400.10 → 7400.86] I blame Austin.
[7401.26 → 7403.74] We bought, we just bought one before his video.
[7404.54 → 7404.76] Yep.
[7404.90 → 7405.42] They're sold out.
[7405.70 → 7406.02] Okay.
[7406.74 → 7408.14] There are three different versions.
[7408.68 → 7410.84] 64 gig, 256 gig, 512 gig.
[7410.92 → 7411.56] They're all sold out.
[7412.36 → 7414.14] Damn you, Austin Evans!
[7415.16 → 7416.56] Also, 399.
[7417.44 → 7417.90] Is it even?
[7417.90 → 7419.68] Oh yeah, it's like a hundred bucks less for each.
[7419.76 → 7420.56] That's pretty significant.
[7420.82 → 7421.08] Holy.
[7422.32 → 7424.32] Is it, is, yeah, same warranty and stuff?
[7424.46 → 7424.82] Wow.
[7429.08 → 7433.32] Even then, at 399, it's still so competitive.
[7435.06 → 7435.50] Yep.
[7435.68 → 7436.06] Love it.
[7436.64 → 7438.84] Pretty cool that they have the fixity hardware and stuff.
[7439.00 → 7440.22] It mentions another creator.
[7440.48 → 7440.72] Oh, bloody.
[7441.86 → 7442.22] Anyway.
[7445.18 → 7446.78] So yeah, I, I don't know.
[7446.78 → 7450.14] I don't know if Lenovo is going to make like serious.
[7450.14 → 7450.66] Oh, right.
[7450.74 → 7452.82] So I was going to talk about why I tolerate the ally.
[7453.20 → 7456.40] It is a it is not an appliance.
[7457.74 → 7460.54] It's a computer with a controller and a battery bolted to it.
[7460.54 → 7462.16] And it really feels like it.
[7462.16 → 7465.68] And it has all the same issues that PC gamer gaming has.
[7466.32 → 7471.14] Like when I put it to sleep, it's most, it's mostly fixed with the latest firmware.
[7471.30 → 7471.96] It's just going to wake up sometimes.
[7471.96 → 7472.18] Yeah.
[7472.24 → 7477.58] Just like, just like wake up sometimes for the, for the, for the first couple of weeks that
[7477.58 → 7479.12] I was playing a chain deco.
[7479.84 → 7485.34] Or, you know, you'll, you'll go to, you'll have like a weird thing where the where it
[7485.34 → 7489.12] doesn't switch from controller to, to joy to mouse mode properly.
[7489.12 → 7490.40] And you're just like, ah, screw it.
[7490.40 → 7490.96] I'll just restart.
[7491.04 → 7492.16] Oh, Windows update.
[7493.48 → 7493.92] Fantastic.
[7493.92 → 7494.20] Fantastic.
[7494.86 → 7495.48] Um, yeah.
[7495.56 → 7495.84] Okay.
[7496.38 → 7496.74] Okay.
[7496.88 → 7497.20] Okay.
[7497.68 → 7502.08] It's stupid little Microsoft's been trying to build an OS for touchscreen since windows
[7502.08 → 7503.88] eight, and they still get basic stuff wrong.
[7504.08 → 7504.52] Okay.
[7504.56 → 7505.60] You boot up the system.
[7505.78 → 7507.26] You just want to log in.
[7508.10 → 7512.56] So you, you swipe a thing, then you click the field.
[7512.68 → 7516.98] And then sometimes I get it where I have to click the field again to get the number pad
[7516.98 → 7518.00] to pop up to enter a pin.
[7518.08 → 7522.58] It's like, this is three interactions when realistically I'm sitting here looking at it.
[7522.58 → 7523.60] It should just be one.
[7523.92 → 7531.02] I should immediately start typing is little things like that, that are just cleaner on
[7531.02 → 7531.58] the steam deck.
[7531.58 → 7535.78] And I think that there's a possibility that Microsoft will take this space seriously and
[7535.78 → 7542.04] that we'll see like a, a, a gaming, you know, a handheld gaming mode, or we'll see some
[7542.04 → 7546.06] kind of version of windows that's like really optimized for these things.
[7546.06 → 7549.80] But I don't think it's a given, and it's certainly not going to happen anytime soon.
[7549.80 → 7555.70] Valve has put a ton of work into making the steam deck more appliance, like more console,
[7555.90 → 7559.80] like, and anything running windows is not going to be that experience.
[7560.90 → 7561.30] Yeah.
[7561.46 → 7561.68] Yeah.
[7561.74 → 7562.10] Fair enough.
[7562.10 → 7568.96] Okay.
[7569.76 → 7570.74] What are we doing right now?
[7570.80 → 7571.20] Topics.
[7573.00 → 7575.94] Someone's upset that I had someone referred to Bellevue as Seattle.
[7576.08 → 7576.78] I love Twitch chat.
[7576.86 → 7579.08] I'm just, I'm going to hang out in Twitch chat.
[7579.40 → 7580.20] Oh man.
[7580.20 → 7582.56] They're my people.
[7583.92 → 7584.62] Professional trolls.
[7585.50 → 7587.30] I want to, oh, wait, what are we supposed to be talking about?
[7587.70 → 7589.22] I think we're still doing topics.
[7589.44 → 7591.52] I think we're done all three of the main ones.
[7591.58 → 7593.26] So we just got to jump through some rapid fires.
[7593.26 → 7598.82] I want to talk about Elon Musk demonstrating full self-driving while filming himself without
[7598.82 → 7599.78] his hands on the wheel.
[7599.92 → 7601.16] Yeah, this is pretty wild.
[7601.58 → 7602.86] Um, do you want to run through it or me?
[7602.96 → 7603.52] Nah, go for it.
[7603.58 → 7607.88] Elon Musk live-streamed a demonstration of Tesla's updated full self-driving beta.
[7607.88 → 7612.98] The car was able to drive almost entirely independently using only cameras and algorithmic
[7612.98 → 7613.46] intelligence.
[7614.12 → 7619.18] At one point, the car attempted to accelerate through a red light requiring Musk to intervene,
[7619.58 → 7621.26] but it was otherwise without incident.
[7621.56 → 7623.64] You know, running red light is no big deal.
[7624.00 → 7630.38] However, Musk spent the demonstration in the driver's seat filming on his cell phone and
[7630.38 → 7636.48] interacting with commenters, which goes against Tesla's own policies for using full self-driving
[7636.48 → 7637.00] software.
[7637.00 → 7639.74] And I believe also the law.
[7640.18 → 7645.32] Um, Palo Alto police say that will not be issuing Musk a ticket or fine because the incident
[7645.32 → 7649.28] wasn't directly witnessed by police.
[7649.48 → 7651.76] So here's what I would like to understand.
[7652.60 → 7655.06] What are the dynamics at play here?
[7655.30 → 7660.58] Because from my understanding, whether you want to talk about, like, let's take some significant
[7660.58 → 7661.26] events.
[7661.42 → 7663.62] Like, let's say the January 6th riot.
[7664.52 → 7666.74] I'm not going to get into the like politics of it.
[7666.74 → 7668.72] I was going to do even way more basic things.
[7668.72 → 7670.34] Like if you see shoplifting on camera.
[7670.34 → 7676.80] But there were plenty of people who were absolutely prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law based
[7676.80 → 7685.00] on footage and not necessarily someone who actually like a law enforcement officer observing
[7685.00 → 7687.88] that individual committing a particular act.
[7687.88 → 7695.30] There is massive precedent for catching people doing something on camera.
[7695.30 → 7701.48] Why does it matter that the person catching them on camera happened to be themselves?
[7701.48 → 7705.94] People are saying federal instead of local.
[7705.94 → 7706.94] All this other stuff.
[7706.94 → 7709.18] I don't know how the law works there.
[7709.92 → 7711.42] Any chance of adding video?
[7711.92 → 7713.16] Oh, this is about floodplain stuff.
[7716.40 → 7717.60] Federal versus state law.
[7717.68 → 7722.24] Yeah, this is like America stuff that we don't know, I think.
[7723.34 → 7725.10] Like, is it like a self-incrimination thing?
[7725.22 → 7726.86] Because your like can't incriminate yourself.
[7726.86 → 7728.56] Yeah, I have a feeling.
[7728.78 → 7729.02] Is it that simple?
[7729.10 → 7732.48] So as long as I film myself doing it and nobody else sees it, it's not a crime?
[7734.22 → 7738.86] And something to remember is I am feigning ignorance a little bit here because traffic
[7738.86 → 7742.76] code is not necessarily the same as criminal code.
[7742.92 → 7744.44] In some cases there are overlap.
[7744.78 → 7747.64] So you can commit a traffic violation that is also criminal.
[7747.64 → 7750.52] But not every traffic violation is criminal.
[7750.52 → 7754.86] If he had actually killed someone, well, that's manslaughter now.
[7755.06 → 7756.50] And that's criminal code.
[7756.68 → 7758.54] Or maybe potentially actually running the red light.
[7758.66 → 7758.78] Yeah.
[7759.18 → 7761.28] Because like, think about red light cameras.
[7763.42 → 7765.06] Yeah, but that's not his camera.
[7765.24 → 7766.34] That's like their camera.
[7766.62 → 7767.86] So maybe it's different because of that.
[7768.42 → 7769.16] I don't know.
[7769.18 → 7773.68] Remember when one of his lawyers argued that anything that he said previously could be
[7773.68 → 7776.30] a deep fake, therefore we can't hold him accountable for it?
[7776.36 → 7776.92] That was pretty epic.
[7776.92 → 7778.78] I wonder if that would have been the defence here.
[7779.34 → 7780.58] Hey, you don't know its real footage?
[7781.66 → 7784.54] Yeah, I mean, we faked so much about the capabilities of our vehicles.
[7784.76 → 7785.58] Why not this?
[7785.68 → 7788.60] Maybe what was outside the window was just green screens and this was all filmed in a
[7788.60 → 7788.82] studio.
[7788.98 → 7789.92] I just got myself in trouble.
[7790.34 → 7793.88] I didn't even hear what he said, which is highly concerning to be completely honest.
[7794.40 → 7795.26] But anyway.
[7795.38 → 7796.88] I was poking at the Tesla fanboys.
[7797.46 → 7798.26] Oh, that's fine.
[7798.34 → 7798.78] Yeah, okay.
[7799.20 → 7801.94] I feel like they have toned it down a lot.
[7803.20 → 7806.78] Like, remember how it used to be when you would point out anything?
[7806.78 → 7808.46] Anything that's not positive about Tesla?
[7808.46 → 7808.80] Okay, okay, okay.
[7809.12 → 7813.94] To defend that slightly, I think that's because people were getting very defensive about electric
[7813.94 → 7814.82] cars in general.
[7815.50 → 7817.76] Because they wanted electric cars to become a thing.
[7818.14 → 7820.80] And Tesla was like, it's the best chance of that happening.
[7821.32 → 7822.68] And now that has happened.
[7823.72 → 7829.90] And now it's like, oh man, producing all these batteries is like really hard.
[7830.02 → 7832.84] And there are downsides to things and stuff.
[7833.26 → 7833.66] Yeah.
[7833.78 → 7835.44] Generating power in certain places.
[7835.44 → 7836.52] Like here, it's very easy.
[7836.64 → 7840.40] Power is very economical here and quite environmentally friendly because it's all falling water.
[7840.64 → 7846.68] I also think a big part of it is the cult of personality around that particular individual
[7846.68 → 7848.12] has eroded a lot.
[7848.14 → 7848.86] Did you see the what was it?
[7848.88 → 7849.62] A Valorant match?
[7849.70 → 7850.66] Did you see this, Dan?
[7851.86 → 7852.48] I don't remember what it was.
[7852.72 → 7852.82] What?
[7854.32 → 7857.06] There was some form of match that he was at recently.
[7857.16 → 7857.98] Some gaming event.
[7858.12 → 7858.64] Elon Musk?
[7858.94 → 7859.30] Yeah.
[7859.82 → 7860.02] Oh.
[7860.02 → 7865.30] And he was spotted in the crowd by the camera people and put on the big screens.
[7865.52 → 7867.66] And then everyone was booing while he was on camera.
[7867.78 → 7868.34] Not everyone.
[7869.68 → 7872.04] Audibly, the crowd was booing while he was on camera.
[7872.20 → 7877.88] And then after he was off camera, they started chanting like bring back Twitter or something
[7877.88 → 7878.40] like that.
[7878.62 → 7881.30] I don't know what it was, but it was pretty funny.
[7881.76 → 7883.06] That is impressive.
[7883.52 → 7885.14] That's got to be, that's got to suck.
[7885.78 → 7886.70] But anyway.
[7886.90 → 7887.12] Yeah.
[7887.12 → 7888.80] You could try blocking them in real life.
[7888.80 → 7895.90] I got to say, I, um, having had the experience that I did recently, I, I do feel for the
[7895.90 → 7901.50] guy, you know, doing something that is actually bad and people being mad at you for it is
[7901.50 → 7902.12] quite a thing.
[7906.86 → 7909.54] I'm not saying I, I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.
[7909.56 → 7911.96] I'm just saying that I have some empathy.
[7911.96 → 7917.68] Due to recent events, I feel empathetic for Elon Musk is a genuinely hilarious statement.
[7917.68 → 7920.54] I, I just, I have to, that is actually so funny.
[7920.68 → 7921.26] I don't like.
[7921.30 → 7925.72] Yeah, doing something catastrophically stupid and having people call you out for it is, uh,
[7925.92 → 7927.60] it's not something I would recommend.
[7928.38 → 7932.94] I bet Linus would have rebranded it to X as well.
[7934.68 → 7935.50] Just L.
[7935.88 → 7936.18] L.
[7936.18 → 7939.46] Oh yeah, there you go.
[7939.72 → 7941.00] We're renaming it L.
[7941.18 → 7943.54] And when you install it on your phone, you're going to take the L.
[7943.98 → 7944.26] Ha!
[7945.16 → 7945.96] Take my L.
[7946.08 → 7946.24] Wait.
[7946.28 → 7949.08] That is actually better branding than what he's done.
[7950.46 → 7951.68] At least it's funnier.
[7952.52 → 7953.52] Uh, whoa.
[7954.18 → 7955.38] Oh, hold on, there's more.
[7955.38 → 7955.96] We already talked about that.
[7955.96 → 7956.68] No, no, there's more.
[7956.78 → 7957.20] There's more.
[7957.64 → 7959.62] Uh, in other Tesla news this week.
[7959.78 → 7961.00] Oh, no, this is not this week.
[7961.00 → 7961.80] This is ages ago.
[7961.80 → 7962.02] Yeah, what are you talking about?
[7962.20 → 7966.56] Um, so the way that he may have been doing this, right, this is why this surfaced again,
[7966.94 → 7970.94] is the Elon mode that exists for hands-free full self-driving.
[7971.38 → 7976.12] Uh, this was surfaced back in June of this year, but a Tesla software hacker found an Elon
[7976.12 → 7981.00] mode driving feature that seems to allow Tesla vehicles with full self-driving to operate
[7981.00 → 7982.36] without any driver monitoring.
[7982.36 → 7987.28] So while he was paying attention, it's possible that the way that he was able to so confidently
[7987.28 → 7993.00] film himself while he was supposed to be operating a vehicle was by using a not street legal
[7993.00 → 7994.86] version of the software, which...
[7994.86 → 7995.16] Very cool.
[7995.52 → 7999.88] Um, makes perfect sense and should be a thing.
[8000.68 → 8002.04] All right, Sea of Stars.
[8003.28 → 8006.56] All I ask is no spoilers in chat.
[8007.46 → 8010.88] You might just want to not reach out for a bit because people are going to hear that and
[8010.88 → 8012.00] then purposely try to spoil it.
[8012.00 → 8012.80] I'm going to close chat.
[8012.94 → 8013.04] Yeah.
[8013.12 → 8015.34] So there's no point doing it because I'm not going to see it.
[8015.54 → 8016.90] Both my chats are closed.
[8017.02 → 8017.38] Boom.
[8017.68 → 8018.04] You're done.
[8018.28 → 8018.40] Yeah.
[8018.72 → 8020.92] Um, okay.
[8020.98 → 8022.30] So then what can we say?
[8022.34 → 8029.16] Because I am one of those people who I am obsessive about knowing absolutely nothing
[8029.16 → 8031.98] about a piece of media that I know I'm going to consume.
[8032.28 → 8035.04] I've, I read one article about Sea of Stars.
[8035.34 → 8037.30] It went on my to play list.
[8038.18 → 8040.74] Um, I think the notes that are in the doc right now are fine.
[8040.74 → 8041.28] Okay.
[8041.40 → 8042.04] I'll read through it.
[8042.24 → 8042.36] Yeah.
[8042.54 → 8046.86] Sea of Stars released this week for, uh, to a great deal of excitement given its visual
[8046.86 → 8052.24] and thematic similarity to JRPGs of JRPG classics of the past, like Final Fantasy and Throne
[8052.24 → 8052.50] Trigger.
[8052.96 → 8054.44] Reviews have praised its maps.
[8055.36 → 8056.14] Word building.
[8056.28 → 8057.04] I think it's world building.
[8057.16 → 8058.04] I like word building though.
[8058.04 → 8058.86] It's probably true enough.
[8059.08 → 8062.30] Uh, world building, combat, characters, music, and story.
[8062.42 → 8063.80] And then there's just discussion questions.
[8063.80 → 8063.96] Wow.
[8063.96 → 8065.04] There's not much more than that.
[8065.04 → 8065.74] That's all the notes.
[8065.98 → 8071.66] I'm like a big part of the motivation for me to finally pick up Chained Echoes was that
[8071.66 → 8077.16] I've had this list of these, you know, classic JRPG inspired games to play.
[8077.26 → 8080.92] That's been kind of building up as some of them have come out here.
[8080.94 → 8081.20] I got it.
[8081.20 → 8082.30] I got to check what's on my list now.
[8082.70 → 8083.06] Okay.
[8084.34 → 8088.62] Uh, the discussion questions here are, are we entering a better era of gaming?
[8088.62 → 8091.22] And dang tootin' it seems like it.
[8091.36 → 8095.04] I think we maybe have been here for a little bit, and it took me until pretty much now to
[8095.04 → 8099.96] accept it and realize it, uh, because I was traumatized from games for years.
[8100.46 → 8103.04] Um, but yeah, I think things are good.
[8103.34 → 8104.60] I think things are good right now.
[8104.80 → 8108.20] Like the amount of bangers coming out is actually like crazy.
[8108.60 → 8109.92] In no particular order.
[8110.12 → 8113.90] Here are some of the games that are on my, I absolutely must play.
[8113.90 → 8120.50] Um, destroy all humans, Dragon Quest XI, play that Chinese game that's basically Breath
[8120.50 → 8120.88] of the Wild.
[8120.98 → 8121.60] That's hilarious.
[8122.14 → 8122.38] Gen shin.
[8125.50 → 8127.66] I wrote this a lot down a long time ago.
[8127.68 → 8128.18] I don't know if you're going to like Gen shin.
[8128.32 → 8132.06] I probably won't base on that I didn't like Breath of the Wild 2 or rather that it didn't
[8132.06 → 8132.64] suck me in.
[8132.96 → 8138.34] Um, uh, play Fantasia, which I made it a lot of the way through until I reached like kind
[8138.34 → 8143.62] of some mobile game, stupid, like QC issues or like, I shouldn't call them quality
[8143.62 → 8144.10] control.
[8144.26 → 8152.04] It did crash a fair bit on my Apple TV, but, um, more like, um, QA, like, like, uh, game
[8152.04 → 8157.92] testing, uh, game testing issues, uh, project triangle thing on switch, uh, Bravely Default
[8157.92 → 8159.04] 2, which I have checked off.
[8159.22 → 8162.14] It Takes Two, TIE Fighter Total Conversion, Sea of Stars.
[8162.32 → 8167.92] So Sea of Stars has been on here since before Rise of the Third Power, Arial, Titan fall
[8167.92 → 8171.24] 2 single player, Risk of Rain 2, uh, Stray.
[8171.46 → 8172.32] Oh, I've played that.
[8172.48 → 8172.60] Cool.
[8172.60 → 8173.10] Risk of Rain 2.
[8173.10 → 8174.28] Did you play Risk of Rain 1?
[8174.80 → 8175.06] No.
[8175.50 → 8177.10] I don't know if you're going to care about Risk of Rain 2.
[8177.32 → 8179.34] Barrington recommended that I play it with you.
[8179.66 → 8180.22] So, I don't know.
[8180.26 → 8180.44] With me.
[8180.52 → 8181.28] Make of that what you will.
[8181.86 → 8182.08] Yeah.
[8182.36 → 8185.46] Um, Reach the Future Final Fantasy Tactics mod.
[8186.16 → 8186.82] That sounds cool.
[8186.88 → 8188.22] I've totally forgotten about that.
[8188.74 → 8190.70] That Final Fantasy game for Android.
[8190.92 → 8192.16] Oh, oh, this is super cool.
[8192.34 → 8196.96] I found an article about this on somewhere, and they were like, hey, remember that Final Fantasy
[8196.96 → 8202.22] game that absolutely nobody ever talked about and was basically the very end of good mobile
[8202.22 → 8203.46] games.
[8203.46 → 8204.42] It's called Final Fantasy Dimensions.
[8204.74 → 8207.50] It's heavily inspired by Final Fantasy 5.
[8207.50 → 8212.08] It's like a sprite pixel art style Final Fantasy game.
[8212.32 → 8213.68] No microtransaction crap.
[8213.78 → 8216.54] You just like buy it for $14 or whatever it is.
[8216.62 → 8218.36] You play it on your Android device.
[8219.18 → 8223.14] And, um, and then microtransaction hell happened.
[8223.14 → 8224.50] And that was it.
[8224.58 → 8226.56] That was like, that was like the end, but it's still out there.
[8226.60 → 8227.40] You can still get it.
[8227.92 → 8228.32] Yeah.
[8228.50 → 8230.00] It only has 3.6 stars.
[8231.36 → 8234.60] It's very true to the older games.
[8235.12 → 8238.96] There's some quality of life stuff, but apparent, I haven't played it yet, but apparently it's
[8238.96 → 8242.78] like very old style and maybe not everyone, maybe not everyone would like that.
[8244.38 → 8244.78] Dimensions.
[8245.26 → 8245.66] Yeah.
[8245.66 → 8247.40] I searched Final Fantasy Dimensions.
[8247.60 → 8251.14] The first thing that came up was Final Fantasy B-E-W-O-T-V.
[8251.64 → 8252.56] I have no idea what that is.
[8252.58 → 8254.46] The next thing is Final Fantasy Dimensions.
[8255.30 → 8257.72] I don't know why it's second, and it's rated much more highly.
[8258.18 → 8258.36] Yeah.
[8258.38 → 8259.34] What's, what's the star rating?
[8259.78 → 8260.48] Uh, 4.3.
[8260.64 → 8260.86] Yeah.
[8260.94 → 8261.12] Okay.
[8261.22 → 8262.60] Which for a mobile app is like, that's great.
[8263.26 → 8265.48] Um, local co-op game Grounded.
[8266.04 → 8266.56] Max Payne.
[8266.56 → 8269.10] I still haven't played a single Max Payne game.
[8269.58 → 8271.00] Uh, Pixel Cup Soccer.
[8271.12 → 8271.74] Max Payne's good.
[8271.74 → 8272.46] Chained Echoes.
[8272.56 → 8272.72] Ooh.
[8273.34 → 8274.14] I'm going to check that off.
[8274.18 → 8274.94] I'm on the final dungeon.
[8275.04 → 8275.76] I've played enough of that.
[8276.46 → 8279.88] Um, 8-Bit Adventures, The Forgotten Journey and sequel.
[8280.12 → 8280.82] Sociopath Traveller.
[8280.86 → 8282.88] I still haven't played Sociopath Traveller.
[8283.40 → 8284.88] This is an interesting little story.
[8284.88 → 8285.26] So that's my list.
[8285.40 → 8287.00] That's my list of stuff that I will play.
[8287.06 → 8287.32] Darn it.
[8287.72 → 8290.08] Final Fantasy Dimensions, 4.3 stars.
[8290.62 → 8293.68] Final Fantasy Dimensions 2, 2.6 stars.
[8293.68 → 8294.24] Well, yeah.
[8295.62 → 8297.36] Womb womb womb.
[8301.74 → 8304.78] I should just, you know what I should do?
[8305.08 → 8308.30] Is I should just let the community, like, order my games.
[8308.36 → 8314.32] I'm not going to let them pick games because they probably will have a hard time picking games that I would actually get into and enjoy.
[8314.94 → 8321.88] Um, but if I just, like, took my game order, and they were just like, yeah, just play them in this order, then I could just, just always not think about it.
[8321.88 → 8326.22] Because honestly, choice paralysis is a huge problem for me.
[8326.22 → 8327.96] Oh, and that's probably me.
[8330.16 → 8335.10] I'm back on my old Note 9 and I think it's also contributing to the interference this time.
[8335.26 → 8336.30] Do Titan fall 2 first.
[8337.12 → 8337.52] Oh, shoot.
[8337.56 → 8338.24] No, that was on the list.
[8338.30 → 8339.84] I just didn't say it because you already knew that one.
[8339.86 → 8340.52] Yeah, you said order, though.
[8341.06 → 8342.60] Oh, was it on the list?
[8342.74 → 8342.92] Yeah.
[8343.00 → 8343.48] Did I say it?
[8343.88 → 8344.82] Okay, I thought I skipped it.
[8344.84 → 8344.98] Sorry.
[8347.48 → 8353.12] Fart Muncher 69 420 asks, have you tried Final Fantasy 6?
[8353.12 → 8356.84] There are some things I worry about with you.
[8356.92 → 8358.46] I can't tell if you're Memling or not.
[8359.10 → 8365.06] Where, like, I've been trying to get him to watch one particular movie for, like, actually 13 years or something.
[8365.22 → 8369.22] Yeah, and my sister's been trying to get me to watch, um, Fanboys.
[8369.54 → 8373.90] You've also been trying to get me to watch Hackers, which I intend to watch them.
[8373.98 → 8374.64] I really do.
[8374.76 → 8375.10] I just...
[8375.10 → 8376.68] Yeah, except it's been 13 years.
[8376.70 → 8378.58] I find very little time to consume media.
[8378.58 → 8387.50] The problem is, at this point, when he finally watches it, it's going to be impossible for it to live up to whatever hype this is.
[8388.32 → 8390.56] I don't consider your recommendation that hype.
[8390.94 → 8392.86] And then Titan fall 2...
[8392.86 → 8393.58] I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[8393.68 → 8396.72] Titan fall 2 is, like...
[8396.72 → 8397.52] I just...
[8397.52 → 8397.76] I don't...
[8397.76 → 8403.06] It's a fantastic single-player shooter game, but we've been talking about it for years now, so, like...
[8403.06 → 8404.40] I'll enjoy it.
[8404.46 → 8404.90] Don't even...
[8404.90 → 8405.48] Don't even worry.
[8405.66 → 8406.02] I don't know.
[8406.04 → 8409.38] If it's anywhere near as good as Fear, then I'll enjoy the crap out of it.
[8409.46 → 8410.28] And it probably is.
[8410.34 → 8411.28] It's a very, very different game.
[8411.52 → 8413.40] But it does have, like, good gun play.
[8413.74 → 8413.90] Yep.
[8414.02 → 8415.34] And any interesting mechanics.
[8415.56 → 8415.86] Yes.
[8416.02 → 8416.48] Then I'll be fine.
[8416.74 → 8416.98] Alright.
[8417.38 → 8417.84] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8417.84 → 8418.48] I'm not that...
[8418.48 → 8419.48] I'm not actually that picky.
[8419.80 → 8419.98] Yeah.
[8421.20 → 8421.82] It's just...
[8421.82 → 8423.06] You know what the big challenge is?
[8423.06 → 8425.96] Is that it's really hard for me to sit at my computer and play.
[8425.96 → 8430.80] If you watch Blackberry before Pirates of Silicon Valley, I'm actually going to be pissed.
[8430.88 → 8431.58] What's Blackberry?
[8431.76 → 8431.98] Good.
[8433.06 → 8434.34] What?
[8434.48 → 8434.96] That's all I'm saying.
[8435.00 → 8436.54] Am I supposed to know what Blackberry is?
[8437.16 → 8437.88] Not particularly.
[8438.08 → 8438.64] Oh my goodness.
[8438.74 → 8439.56] It's my phone for sure.
[8439.90 → 8440.70] Blackberry movie.
[8441.54 → 8442.78] I've watched the social network.
[8443.58 → 8445.68] I watched that before Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[8445.74 → 8446.18] You like that?
[8447.08 → 8447.34] No.
[8450.88 → 8452.30] It was a silent one, but I farted.
[8452.54 → 8453.28] I know.
[8453.70 → 8455.22] I saw you do the lip.
[8457.22 → 8458.00] A Canadian?
[8458.30 → 8459.16] Someone said Blackberry's good.
[8459.44 → 8459.68] Yeah.
[8459.90 → 8461.08] And you know what?
[8461.08 → 8463.48] It takes a lot of inspiration from?
[8463.70 → 8464.58] Pirates of Silicon Valley!
[8465.20 → 8466.80] Oh my god.
[8470.88 → 8471.32] Anyway.
[8471.78 → 8472.14] Sorry.
[8472.14 → 8475.20] Oh.
[8475.62 → 8478.64] Is the name of the stream on Float plane wrong?
[8479.30 → 8480.76] Buy a Stubby Rune Kyle's Day?
[8481.46 → 8483.20] You might need to refresh.
[8483.54 → 8483.72] Oh.
[8484.00 → 8484.22] Okay.
[8484.28 → 8486.60] Maybe I've had it open since before the...
[8486.60 → 8486.92] Oh yeah.
[8486.98 → 8487.36] There we go.
[8487.44 → 8487.66] Okay.
[8487.76 → 8488.24] Good job, Dan.
[8489.54 → 8489.90] Cool.
[8490.34 → 8490.90] There we go.
[8490.90 → 8492.50] Yeah.
[8492.50 → 8494.80] That was a stream we ran today.
[8495.24 → 8499.06] Every time someone bought a Stubby screwdriver, it would make a noise in Kyle's office.
[8499.22 → 8503.12] And then we had a live stream running of his office that was Float plane exclusive.
[8503.28 → 8505.30] Apparently they did some Q&A and stuff on it as well.
[8505.68 → 8505.98] That's cool.
[8506.14 → 8506.58] So that's...
[8506.58 → 8506.72] Yeah.
[8506.74 → 8507.30] That's pretty cool.
[8507.30 → 8509.30] It was inspired by Puget Systems.
[8509.50 → 8513.82] When we did the tour there, they have like a gong that goes off in their warehouse every
[8513.82 → 8515.06] time someone buys a computer.
[8515.60 → 8521.52] Which I imagine, you know, when you're selling, you know, three, four, $10,000 computers, they
[8521.52 → 8523.64] do a lot of really high-end workstations and stuff there.
[8524.30 → 8529.76] Probably doesn't go off that often for a, you know, still very sustainable, you know,
[8529.82 → 8531.02] profitable company or whatever.
[8531.02 → 8538.12] Whereas when you're talking like a $60 screwdriver on launch day, it was going off basically
[8538.12 → 8540.26] continuously for quite a while there.
[8541.70 → 8545.72] Apparently Kyle did not get any work done today, according to Float plane chat.
[8545.78 → 8546.32] That's amazing.
[8546.74 → 8547.26] That makes sense.
[8547.50 → 8547.92] That's okay.
[8547.98 → 8550.36] His work was to entertain you guys.
[8550.50 → 8552.02] I have watched Antitrust, by the way.
[8554.24 → 8554.94] Good for you.
[8555.36 → 8555.68] No, someone's...
[8555.68 → 8556.32] I know.
[8556.64 → 8557.68] Come on!
[8558.16 → 8558.66] I'm just...
[8558.66 → 8559.48] Come on!
[8559.48 → 8561.12] I'm messing with him a lot today.
[8561.22 → 8561.66] It's been a lot.
[8561.80 → 8561.92] It's okay.
[8561.92 → 8562.98] I'm like actually kind of...
[8562.98 → 8563.12] It's okay.
[8563.16 → 8563.66] It's a long weekend.
[8563.76 → 8564.62] I'm feeling spicy.
[8564.78 → 8565.94] I'm feeling spicy today.
[8567.26 → 8572.48] Speaking of spicy, Intel announces a photonic chip with scads of threads.
[8573.08 → 8573.48] Scads.
[8573.78 → 8574.18] Scads.
[8574.32 → 8575.62] That's a metric term.
[8576.36 → 8577.14] Metric scads.
[8578.44 → 8579.44] It's a real unit.
[8580.06 → 8581.04] I don't believe you.
[8581.08 → 8581.78] It's like a moment.
[8582.04 → 8584.58] You know, we use it colloquially, but it's actually a real thing.
[8584.74 → 8585.74] That one's actually true, though.
[8585.80 → 8585.98] Yeah.
[8586.78 → 8587.02] Yeah.
[8587.74 → 8588.62] Scads is true.
[8588.82 → 8589.32] Look it up.
[8589.32 → 8590.08] Is it actually?
[8590.30 → 8590.58] Yes.
[8591.60 → 8592.54] No, I'm not going to do it.
[8592.80 → 8593.48] He's going to do it.
[8593.54 → 8593.66] Nope.
[8593.74 → 8594.46] He has to now.
[8594.52 → 8594.68] Nope.
[8594.88 → 8597.20] Because you know that I could...
[8597.20 → 8601.28] Intel has unveiled Puma, a photonic chip that is based on custom RISC architecture,
[8601.50 → 8608.62] with eight cores and 66 threads per core, for a total of 528 threads.
[8608.62 → 8617.12] modern x86 CPUs usually have only two threads per core, with some exceptions, such as Intel's
[8617.12 → 8621.40] Leon Phi, which had four threads per core, IBM's Power 8, which had eight.
[8621.54 → 8624.74] Which isn't a modern x86 chip, but is a modern chip.
[8624.98 → 8625.18] Yep.
[8625.40 → 8627.70] And Sun's Spark chips, which went up to 16.
[8627.84 → 8630.66] Which is also not x86, but...
[8630.66 → 8630.88] Yeah.
[8631.06 → 8631.20] Yeah.
[8631.20 → 8632.94] It's just that we said modern x86.
[8632.94 → 8634.22] No, I totally got you.
[8634.28 → 8634.42] Yeah.
[8634.42 → 8635.18] It's worded weird.
[8635.52 → 8645.20] The chip only uses 75 watts of power and uses 32 optical I.O. ports that each operate at 32 gigs per second per...
[8646.36 → 8647.10] Direction.
[8647.26 → 8647.76] Direction.
[8647.76 → 8648.76] Wow.
[8649.76 → 8650.96] Holy crap.
[8651.44 → 8658.78] For a total of one terabyte per second of total bandwidth, there are optical interconnects between chips,
[8658.98 → 8666.12] so they can be connected together in eight socket server sleds that, in turn, interconnect with each other.
[8666.16 → 8666.36] Yeah.
[8666.44 → 8671.22] So, like, optical networking, like, directly to the...
[8671.22 → 8673.14] I forget what tour we were on.
[8673.14 → 8676.86] I think Riley called this Sam Altman's wet dream, which I thought was hilarious.
[8677.76 → 8686.76] We were on a tour where we were looking at a configuration that had basically, like, fibre optic connectivity between...
[8687.50 → 8687.68] What?
[8687.78 → 8689.36] Were they, like, daughter boards or something?
[8689.44 → 8690.14] I can't remember.
[8690.28 → 8691.52] Man, it's escaping me now.
[8691.88 → 8693.62] But it was super cool.
[8693.62 → 8698.90] And they were kind of talking to us about the future of, like, scalability in the data centre
[8698.90 → 8712.24] and how, as they get fibre optics closer and closer to the actual dyes, we're going to see the lines blur between what is a chip and what is many chips
[8712.24 → 8715.30] and what is many servers full of many chips.
[8716.14 → 8716.96] Computing unit.
[8717.32 → 8717.58] Yeah.
[8717.58 → 8718.74] It's...
[8718.74 → 8719.58] I...
[8719.58 → 8724.62] Our discussion question here is, will this ever make sense for the consumer prosumer market?
[8724.74 → 8729.32] Honestly, ever is a really, huge word, but I don't see it coming anytime soon.
[8729.42 → 8730.00] I mean, both...
[8730.00 → 8732.26] Soon, I don't think so, but ever, I actually do think so.
[8732.34 → 8735.62] Both Intel and AMD have completely abandoned even HEAT.
[8736.02 → 8736.58] You're running...
[8737.10 → 8738.94] You as in Dan, not the audience.
[8739.10 → 8744.42] You are running, like, LLM AI stuff at home, yeah?
[8744.54 → 8744.70] Yeah.
[8744.70 → 8753.56] Yeah, so, you know, Dan isn't everyone in the world currently, but there's really cool applications for having your own version at home
[8753.56 → 8756.16] that could potentially learn off yourself in the long run.
[8756.24 → 8758.26] We don't have so much right now, but in the long run.
[8758.76 → 8760.54] And also, it keeps it more private.
[8760.68 → 8761.14] There are benefits.
[8761.68 → 8763.46] Do you think you could see that becoming a thing?
[8763.98 → 8764.82] What, running them at home?
[8765.00 → 8765.18] Yeah.
[8765.42 → 8765.62] Yeah.
[8765.62 → 8766.34] For, like, average people?
[8766.42 → 8769.32] We were really hoping that there was going to be this breakthrough technology.
[8769.42 → 8769.78] One sec.
[8769.78 → 8778.88] Which would basically bring, like, data entry-level GPU production to the home from consumer cards, but that ended up not materializing.
[8778.96 → 8781.16] There's some more development in that space right now.
[8781.24 → 8783.42] When we talked about that, I hardcore called it.
[8783.60 → 8784.66] I remember that conversation.
[8785.04 → 8786.04] That it wasn't going to be possible?
[8786.46 → 8786.78] Oh, yeah.
[8786.96 → 8788.90] By that point, I knew it wasn't going to be possible.
[8789.02 → 8791.80] But there's some new stuff that's probably kind of exciting in that space, too.
[8791.80 → 8795.02] So that's kind of not going to be happening.
[8795.16 → 8805.26] But the 4090s and these high-end cards that are consumer-grade actually perform a lot better than some of the dedicated machining learning cards that NVIDIA produces.
[8805.58 → 8805.82] Pretty wild.
[8805.82 → 8813.24] The only downside is that you can't squish 16 of them together into one big GPU.
[8813.60 → 8814.88] So you're VRAM-limited.
[8814.98 → 8816.20] They're not super data centre-friendly.
[8816.60 → 8816.78] Yeah.
[8816.96 → 8818.54] So that's a disadvantage.
[8819.52 → 8820.70] But it's really nice.
[8820.70 → 8822.40] We're kind of doing it.
[8822.46 → 8825.54] I'm doing it at home more as like the hype's died down now.
[8826.02 → 8827.24] And so now we're learning.
[8827.40 → 8829.76] Now we're actually trying to build tools.
[8829.86 → 8831.14] We're trying to figure out how they function.
[8831.30 → 8835.44] We're trying to understand how they work with GPUs.
[8835.52 → 8837.94] Why are they limited to single GPU?
[8838.12 → 8840.68] Why can't that be spread across multiple GPUs?
[8841.52 → 8847.22] Why is inference only able to happen in a single section of VRAM?
[8847.30 → 8849.36] Why can't that be segmented or something like that?
[8849.36 → 8860.18] And learning how LLMs function, the different types of tunes and models and Laura and all the little settings that you don't get to play with when you're using the big boy online LLMs.
[8860.18 → 8866.88] This all to me feels like something that is not consumer ready yet.
[8867.56 → 8867.76] Hell no.
[8867.76 → 8869.92] But it's in that niche enthusiast space.
[8870.18 → 8870.48] Actually.
[8870.62 → 8872.26] Where it might actually get to consumers eventually.
[8872.38 → 8877.02] A lot of people have been producing really, really easy tools that you can basically...
[8877.56 → 8878.74] You've got a one GitHub page.
[8878.80 → 8880.16] You download a one-click installer.
[8880.24 → 8881.84] You've already lost 90% of people.
[8881.84 → 8886.50] I mean, yeah, but I mean, that is way easier than building something from source.
[8886.68 → 8886.80] For sure.
[8886.82 → 8887.28] You know what I mean?
[8887.40 → 8887.52] Yeah.
[8887.72 → 8888.02] No, definitely.
[8888.02 → 8890.14] So somebody who's a little bit computer savvy.
[8890.60 → 8894.00] I mean, the entry point for everybody is just these online websites, right?
[8894.02 → 8895.02] But then you're just playing with them.
[8895.08 → 8897.04] You're not like tinkering, right?
[8898.70 → 8900.12] But it's pretty easy to get going.
[8900.58 → 8900.78] Yeah.
[8900.96 → 8902.04] And they run on consumer cards.
[8902.22 → 8905.00] I think we could see this type of tech being in the home for sure.
[8905.16 → 8905.66] Just...
[8905.66 → 8906.10] Hell yeah.
[8906.10 → 8906.96] Definitely not now.
[8907.18 → 8912.52] And the nice thing is, if you're worried about privacy, like I want to play with having
[8912.52 → 8914.56] a home assistant AI in my house.
[8914.72 → 8914.92] Yeah.
[8915.02 → 8921.02] I don't want all the microphones in my house calling back to Google or Amazon or Microsoft
[8921.02 → 8923.08] every six seconds so it runs in my bedroom.
[8923.72 → 8927.52] You know, that's the kind of space where I'm really seeing this is going to shine.
[8928.14 → 8935.28] Nathan Had says, Linus, it was the IBM tour where they had like eight CPUs sharing cash
[8935.28 → 8936.00] between chips.
[8937.04 → 8937.22] Yeah.
[8937.52 → 8939.46] Oh man, that was cool stuff.
[8939.58 → 8942.72] So yeah, if you guys check out the IBM Z tour that we did.
[8943.48 → 8945.52] Man, IBM reached out recently.
[8945.64 → 8949.66] They want to work together again because they were like thrilled with how that video went.
[8950.12 → 8953.20] But honestly, I was thrilled with how that video went too.
[8953.26 → 8957.28] But I'm a little bit worried that so much of what we were able to say the first time
[8957.28 → 8961.86] around is going to be redundant the second time around because Z moves slowly.
[8961.86 → 8965.14] And that's kind of the point, right?
[8965.22 → 8972.22] Is that they are, they're cutting edge, but in sort of lumbering big iron.
[8972.48 → 8974.06] Giant icebreaker style.
[8974.12 → 8974.80] Kind of way.
[8974.80 → 8977.96] Getting into unfound territory, but you're chugging.
[8978.16 → 8978.40] Yeah.
[8978.52 → 8983.58] And so I worry that if I were to go do it again, I'd be like, what is Z for?
[8983.58 → 8988.70] Z for the same thing it was for last time, but this one's even more wild and better.
[8988.70 → 8990.44] But then maybe I'm underestimating them.
[8990.52 → 8997.16] Maybe I'm going to show up, and they're going to be like, oh yeah, but you know what about
[8997.16 → 8997.64] this?
[8997.64 → 8999.02] So who knows?
[8999.12 → 9002.00] I was just, I was blown away by the kind of cool stuff they had.
[9002.06 → 9006.58] Just everything from their, you know, custom memory modules to those optical interconnects
[9006.58 → 9006.90] and stuff.
[9007.00 → 9007.62] Super cool.
[9008.04 → 9008.22] Yeah.
[9008.44 → 9008.60] Yeah.
[9008.60 → 9008.74] Yeah.
[9010.10 → 9012.78] I think we have like one or two more topics, and then it's After Dark.
[9013.00 → 9014.00] Yeah, I think so.
[9014.08 → 9014.48] I mean.
[9014.74 → 9017.10] YouTube offers amnesty for channel warnings.
[9017.10 → 9017.42] Yeah.
[9017.54 → 9022.86] YouTube is going to be changing their community guidelines policy so that creators can get
[9022.86 → 9029.30] violation warnings removed from their channel if they complete an educational training course
[9029.30 → 9031.70] on YouTube's content policies.
[9033.22 → 9038.94] If creators complete the course and then go 90 days without violating the same policy again,
[9039.10 → 9040.72] the warning will be lifted.
[9041.38 → 9047.08] According to YouTube, more than 80% of creators who receive a warning never violate policies again
[9047.10 → 9052.24] of course, many of those creators were inappropriately flagged and never violated any policy to begin
[9052.24 → 9054.48] with, and we're not really sure if that's reflected in the numbers.
[9054.98 → 9058.70] But would still have to take the course even if they were incorrectly flagged.
[9058.94 → 9063.50] Our discussion question here is why doesn't YouTube fix their policy ambiguities in inaccurate
[9063.50 → 9064.00] moderation?
[9064.36 → 9065.52] And I know the answer to that.
[9065.90 → 9071.78] The answer is that if they keep it ambiguous, they give themselves more flexibility in terms
[9071.78 → 9072.32] of enforcement.
[9072.48 → 9073.14] That's the answer.
[9073.24 → 9074.50] That's always the answer.
[9074.70 → 9075.28] Unpopular opinion.
[9075.38 → 9075.98] They might need that.
[9075.98 → 9079.68] Everybody wants super clear guidelines.
[9079.94 → 9083.24] Oh, for things like, okay, so here's something that a lot of people don't know.
[9083.30 → 9084.54] This is like inside baseball.
[9085.04 → 9090.94] YouTube has engines that run internally that analyze thumbnails for whether they are
[9090.94 → 9091.62] clickbait.
[9092.64 → 9093.18] Did you know that?
[9093.64 → 9093.92] No.
[9093.92 → 9094.36] Yeah.
[9094.36 → 9101.42] So they will rate a video's title and thumbnail for how clickbait-like they are.
[9101.48 → 9107.52] And this includes all kinds of factors like the expression on the face and what objects
[9107.52 → 9112.74] are in it and similarity to other clickbait thumbnails.
[9112.74 → 9119.72] And when I say clickbait, I mean the actual definition of clickbait, which is baiting someone into clicking
[9119.72 → 9121.56] something that they otherwise wouldn't.
[9121.62 → 9127.72] I'm not talking about, you know, effective packaging that is clickable for something that,
[9127.78 → 9133.74] you know, is similar to, you know, what the thumbnail was, where the thumbnail is representative
[9133.74 → 9134.22] of the content.
[9134.22 → 9139.30] I'm talking about like the old school, like Phil DeFranco thumbnails with the just like
[9139.30 → 9140.58] boobs in them all the time.
[9141.14 → 9142.10] Clickbait, right?
[9142.80 → 9149.18] So YouTube has systems that will analyze thumbnails and determine how clickbait they are.
[9149.18 → 9155.82] And they give creators general guidelines like, oh, if you were to do this, that would be an
[9155.82 → 9162.58] example of something that would possibly be treated as kind of clickbaity, at least initially.
[9163.08 → 9166.62] You know if they find that it's a quality piece of content and people who click on it
[9166.62 → 9170.18] are quite satisfied, then that will drank it in clickbait ness.
[9170.42 → 9176.20] But these are things that might get your content kind of flagged as possibly clickbait, but they
[9176.20 → 9180.32] won't tell you exactly what those things are for two reasons.
[9180.52 → 9182.88] A, they're always changing.
[9183.52 → 9186.12] And B, and that's by design.
[9186.52 → 9192.06] And B, if they tell us exactly where the lines are, there's going to be a significant proportion
[9192.06 → 9197.50] of content creators that are going to go right up against them.
[9198.52 → 9202.78] And that's the way that it is, whether it's community guidelines or whether it's, you know,
[9202.78 → 9207.44] clickbait analysis or, you know, whatever it happens to be, or whether it's, you know,
[9207.90 → 9214.44] a spiffing Brit, you know, hack the platform, you know, exploit, like whether it was polls
[9214.44 → 9218.32] and polls in community posts or, you know, whatever else it is, you know, they're always
[9218.32 → 9222.02] looking for ways to, to open up exploits and close them.
[9222.02 → 9223.50] And it's always changing.
[9223.60 → 9224.66] The sands are always shifting.
[9224.66 → 9227.46] And that is 100% on purpose.
[9233.68 → 9234.84] What else we got today?
[9235.64 → 9236.88] Uh, not a ton.
[9237.10 → 9237.38] Okay.
[9237.44 → 9238.28] Let's call that it.
[9238.36 → 9239.86] I think it's time for WAN Show After Dark.
[9240.00 → 9240.28] Sure.
[9241.88 → 9242.64] Sounds good.
[9243.24 → 9248.18] Um, Dan, do we have any possible hope of getting through all these merch messages?
[9248.50 → 9252.48] Well, if you start going through the potentials while I take a while to, uh, stand up and turn
[9252.48 → 9252.88] off the light.
[9252.88 → 9257.16] Yeah, maybe I couldn't help noticing that it's been a bit of a day for merch messages.
[9257.16 → 9258.16] I didn't even notice.
[9258.36 → 9258.70] It has been a bit of a day.
[9258.70 → 9261.04] I think I'm just, just in the zone.
[9261.08 → 9262.44] I'm just capable of this now.
[9262.52 → 9263.36] Just rocking it.
[9263.56 → 9265.60] It's just been this for so many weeks.
[9265.74 → 9266.88] My fingers are fire.
[9267.44 → 9271.60] I had a new, I had a new keyboard made that you can't even hear anymore.
[9271.60 → 9272.12] It's awesome.
[9272.24 → 9273.60] Oh, oh yeah.
[9273.70 → 9274.12] I haven't heard.
[9274.36 → 9274.44] Yeah.
[9274.84 → 9277.82] Uh, I tried every single keyboard that we had in the building.
[9278.84 → 9280.92] Uh, I mean, it's just, it looks like a normal keyboard.
[9281.04 → 9281.72] It really does.
[9281.82 → 9282.82] It has new switches.
[9282.98 → 9285.16] I was expecting to be very impressed by your...
[9285.16 → 9286.54] No, but here, right next to the mic.
[9286.84 → 9287.12] Keyboard.
[9287.28 → 9288.42] We can't see what you're doing.
[9288.52 → 9289.90] Oh, he's, it's the sound.
[9290.04 → 9291.02] It's just the sound.
[9291.18 → 9292.02] Yeah, but he's off the camera.
[9292.12 → 9293.34] It's just, it's robotic.
[9293.74 → 9295.14] This is a video pod, oh my god.
[9295.86 → 9297.00] Um, wow.
[9297.06 → 9297.82] You're upsetting it.
[9298.54 → 9299.72] You're going to be on the camera.
[9300.24 → 9300.92] Okay, there we go.
[9300.92 → 9305.88] This is, uh, this is my voice for comparison.
[9305.88 → 9306.18] It's very quiet.
[9306.38 → 9306.98] What are the switches?
[9307.54 → 9308.78] I have no idea.
[9309.58 → 9311.12] Did Pouffe recommend them or something?
[9311.26 → 9311.64] I don't know.
[9311.64 → 9312.26] Matt made it.
[9312.36 → 9312.90] He killed it.
[9312.98 → 9313.50] It's awesome.
[9313.80 → 9314.14] Okay.
[9314.32 → 9314.48] Cool.
[9314.70 → 9314.92] That's sick.
[9314.92 → 9315.08] Cool.
[9315.44 → 9316.72] Uh, oh yeah, I was getting up.
[9316.92 → 9318.44] Do, uh, for the potentials.
[9318.44 → 9318.98] Oh, sure.
[9319.12 → 9319.32] Yeah.
[9319.54 → 9319.86] Um.
[9319.86 → 9320.30] Start at the top.
[9320.86 → 9322.18] Sure, I'll, I'll start at the bottom.
[9322.18 → 9324.96] Oh my, I, it took me that long to scroll past incoming.
[9325.30 → 9325.68] There's a lot.
[9326.32 → 9328.30] Uh, we might be boned.
[9328.88 → 9331.42] Um, okay, well, I'll just curate that one.
[9331.48 → 9334.90] Oh crap, there's, uh, okay, there's not that many that he actually curated.
[9335.02 → 9335.62] Okay, so that's good.
[9335.66 → 9337.32] We might be, we might be okay here, Dan.
[9337.72 → 9338.06] Oh yeah.
[9340.18 → 9347.06] Um, okay, uh, Jan Michael asks, what feature would make you want to upgrade back to a slab
[9347.06 → 9348.30] style phone?
[9349.02 → 9350.92] Um, you know what?
[9350.92 → 9357.44] I think I'm just at the point now where I appreciate the pros and cons of everything.
[9357.92 → 9364.18] Um, iOS, Android, the dealbreaker for me for iOS is not being able to sideload apps.
[9364.18 → 9368.06] If Apple addressed that, which they might with some of the stuff that's been going on with
[9368.06 → 9373.26] the EU, if Apple addressed that, I just don't think it would make much of a difference to
[9373.26 → 9375.36] me because every platform has its pros and cons.
[9375.42 → 9377.98] And honestly, I feel the same way about folding versus non-folding.
[9378.40 → 9380.68] There are issues with folding phones.
[9380.92 → 9383.20] There are advantages to folding phones.
[9383.30 → 9384.52] We actually have a video coming.
[9384.62 → 9388.92] That's just 10 things that are just plain better about folding phones.
[9389.60 → 9394.34] And it is not a video about things that are bad about slab phones.
[9394.50 → 9396.78] It's just a video about things that are great about folding phones.
[9396.80 → 9400.28] And I guess I just see it that way across the board.
[9400.36 → 9401.74] Now I'm going back to the note nine.
[9401.84 → 9403.04] There are some things that are bothering me.
[9403.08 → 9404.92] My Wi-Fi chipset seems to be kind of flaky.
[9404.92 → 9408.44] Like I can't connect to five gigahertz at home, even though I can connect to it here and
[9408.44 → 9410.74] every other device in my house can do five gigahertz at home.
[9411.12 → 9414.94] I'm using the same access points at home that we are at the office, which is really wild.
[9415.80 → 9418.08] So like there are some issues, and it's, it's slow.
[9418.46 → 9422.62] It definitely feels slow now, but it's been fine.
[9422.72 → 9423.82] It's been totally fine.
[9423.82 → 9426.52] Um, actually, Luke, I want to get your take on this.
[9427.56 → 9433.56] I had a plan to do a two part video series where the community picks a phone for me.
[9434.12 → 9434.52] Okay.
[9434.52 → 9439.44] So part one, I lay out everything I've liked about every phone I've ever owned and everything
[9439.44 → 9442.08] that I have disliked about every phone I've ever owned.
[9442.14 → 9448.78] So I basically, I walk into a wireless wave, you know, like a, like a, like a chain mobile
[9448.78 → 9449.58] device store.
[9449.76 → 9450.44] Those still exist?
[9450.44 → 9455.36] So I'm, I think so, but basically I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm role-playing as someone who walks
[9455.36 → 9456.80] into a mobile device store.
[9457.10 → 9462.00] I lay out my needs, and then I basically just give it to the community and I take whatever
[9462.00 → 9463.22] the top-up voted devices.
[9463.50 → 9468.44] I use it for a month, and then I come back, and I basically go, you guys nailed it or you
[9468.44 → 9469.46] guys got it totally wrong.
[9470.74 → 9471.18] Or.
[9472.08 → 9472.52] Okay.
[9472.62 → 9475.16] So I came up with this idea when I dropped the fold in the pool.
[9475.16 → 9480.46] Before that happened, I had apparently reached out to the Fairphone folks.
[9481.28 → 9483.44] My Fairphone 5 review sample arrived today.
[9484.92 → 9485.82] Which should I do?
[9485.94 → 9488.10] Should I let the community pick a phone for me to use for a month?
[9488.44 → 9492.58] Or should I just review the Fairphone for a month?
[9492.80 → 9497.76] Or, or should I mention in that video that the Fairphone 5 is totally an option and I totally
[9497.76 → 9499.74] have one and see if they just want me to try that one?
[9500.32 → 9500.86] Maybe that.
[9500.86 → 9504.58] I like, I like the Fairphone at the very least being an option.
[9504.72 → 9505.38] Everyone says both.
[9505.50 → 9507.38] I hate doing phone reviews now though, guys.
[9507.46 → 9508.76] It's, uh, it's such a hassle.
[9508.96 → 9510.82] Everybody's saying Fairphone, but here's the thing.
[9511.28 → 9516.50] If you do the other option and then just vote for Fairphone, that seems cool.
[9516.72 → 9517.64] That's more democratic.
[9517.90 → 9518.12] Yeah.
[9519.38 → 9519.84] I think so.
[9520.18 → 9521.22] You're going to get trolled though.
[9521.30 → 9521.92] If you do a poll.
[9522.12 → 9523.14] That's my one concern.
[9523.32 → 9525.98] I mean, I'm, I, I, I actually, you know what?
[9525.98 → 9531.00] We've had this conversation and I, that, that was raised by, I think both Jordan and James.
[9531.12 → 9534.42] Didn't the internet send like Taylor Swift to a school for the deaf or something?
[9534.64 → 9536.20] Here's my argument back.
[9539.96 → 9544.28] Don't underestimate the fanboy ness of fanboys.
[9546.08 → 9548.12] How much do people...
[9548.12 → 9549.14] Don't underestimate internet trolls.
[9549.40 → 9550.36] Hold on, hold on.
[9550.52 → 9551.44] No, no, I wouldn't.
[9551.50 → 9551.82] I wouldn't.
[9551.82 → 9555.82] But also don't underestimate the fanboy ness of fanboys.
[9556.26 → 9563.30] Think about how eager people are to have someone else try this, that thing they like.
[9563.74 → 9566.96] And phones, good Lord.
[9568.24 → 9571.94] People are very emotional about their phones, and it makes sense, right?
[9572.02 → 9578.46] It's the thing that is with you more than almost anything else that isn't permanently attached to your body.
[9578.46 → 9582.68] Like, what is it that you carry more reliably in your life than your phone?
[9583.06 → 9588.28] I would take, if I had to pick between keys, wallet, and phone, I would take my phone 100% of the time.
[9588.94 → 9589.10] Yeah.
[9589.64 → 9593.28] I mean, that's, you have a lot of your wallet on your phone and your phone can probably work as keys.
[9593.28 → 9594.18] Yeah, but so would you, probably.
[9595.34 → 9597.02] At least credit card?
[9597.70 → 9597.98] Yeah.
[9598.32 → 9598.58] Yeah.
[9598.78 → 9600.34] As a sort of.
[9600.36 → 9602.64] To be clear, I'm not talking, I'm not talking for a year.
[9603.36 → 9606.56] I'm talking about, you leave the house, you have time to grab one of the three.
[9606.64 → 9607.24] Which one is it?
[9607.64 → 9608.00] Keys.
[9609.24 → 9609.56] Okay.
[9610.98 → 9613.38] Let's assume that you have a way of starting.
[9614.06 → 9615.20] I'm being a jerk.
[9615.24 → 9615.98] You have your car key.
[9616.00 → 9616.94] On a technicality.
[9617.10 → 9617.36] Okay.
[9617.48 → 9619.34] Well, I need to lock my house, so I need at least two of them.
[9619.92 → 9622.90] I need to get into the office, probably, so I need three of them.
[9622.90 → 9624.58] You don't need a key to get into the office, you need your phone.
[9625.70 → 9625.82] Hmm.
[9626.58 → 9627.52] Depends on what time it is.
[9628.40 → 9629.34] Probably you need your phone.
[9631.72 → 9633.40] Anyway, I think you understand my point.
[9633.56 → 9633.74] Yes.
[9633.74 → 9641.16] So it's one of those things that it makes sense that people are very emotional about.
[9641.30 → 9641.40] Yeah.
[9641.40 → 9645.80] They interact with it more than probably almost any other device in their life, right?
[9645.80 → 9648.72] Probably more than their families in some cases.
[9649.28 → 9653.24] So I think there's a solid chance of both.
[9653.24 → 9658.76] I think I might get trolled, but I think farthest the trolling might go is they want
[9658.76 → 9661.02] me to use an iPhone for a month or something like that.
[9661.02 → 9664.50] Like, I think people will actually want to vote for their phone that they love.
[9664.50 → 9666.30] But we'll see.
[9667.06 → 9668.64] You can do whatever you want.
[9669.98 → 9670.68] Can I, though?
[9670.84 → 9672.02] That poll's going to get trolled.
[9672.98 → 9673.96] No, I believe you.
[9674.08 → 9674.58] I believe you.
[9674.58 → 9675.62] Every poll gets trolled.
[9676.36 → 9677.24] It's like a rule of the internet.
[9677.42 → 9680.22] I mean, we're going to lay out at least some ground rules, right?
[9680.22 → 9683.26] Like, I'm not going to use a phone that's not compatible with modern networks.
[9683.36 → 9684.20] Like, that's just stupid.
[9684.20 → 9691.88] So, like, I think we could lay out a ground rule like it has to support a reasonably modern
[9691.88 → 9693.04] version of Android or iOS.
[9693.42 → 9695.36] Like, I'm not going to use an iPhone 3GS.
[9695.54 → 9696.88] I actually have work to do.
[9696.96 → 9697.58] Like, I have a life.
[9698.78 → 9699.44] So, yeah.
[9699.58 → 9700.28] Yeah, you're right.
[9700.40 → 9704.30] People might troll, but it would be within reason.
[9706.82 → 9707.88] I don't know if that's true.
[9709.26 → 9710.42] I mean, it'll have to be.
[9710.62 → 9711.44] Then we'll lay out rules.
[9711.44 → 9715.74] I mean, if we lay out those rules that I already gave, it has to support at least the
[9715.74 → 9717.06] last couple versions of Android.
[9717.62 → 9719.42] So, it can't be anything ancient.
[9719.96 → 9722.02] And it has to support the latest version of iOS.
[9722.42 → 9723.94] Like, it can't be that bad.
[9724.16 → 9724.36] Yeah.
[9725.94 → 9729.52] Yeah, like, people might find some obscure thing, but I mean, yeah, maybe that would be
[9729.52 → 9729.86] interesting.
[9729.96 → 9733.40] Like, there are tons of Android phones out there that you've never heard of from brands that,
[9733.68 → 9735.56] in some cases, you've never even heard of the brand.
[9735.68 → 9737.12] Like, did you know Cat makes phones?
[9737.28 → 9739.06] Like, the tractor company?
[9739.16 → 9740.34] I don't know why I knew that, but yes.
[9740.34 → 9741.90] Yeah, they're super cool.
[9742.00 → 9743.64] Some of them have built-in thermal cameras.
[9743.72 → 9744.28] Actually, pretty sick.
[9744.34 → 9744.84] From FLIR.
[9744.98 → 9745.84] Yeah, FLIR official.
[9746.04 → 9747.58] Like, actual proper thermal cameras in them.
[9747.74 → 9747.88] Yeah.
[9748.16 → 9749.64] I have one that I keep at home.
[9751.66 → 9754.60] Just because, like, occasionally we'll be doing a shoot at my house, and it's like,
[9754.64 → 9756.78] oh, we need a thermal camera, and we don't have the big one.
[9756.84 → 9757.70] And it's like, ah, yes.
[9757.90 → 9760.12] But we have something, which is better than nothing.
[9760.82 → 9762.50] People asked if I gave up on the Fold 5.
[9762.58 → 9764.02] I never switched to the Fold 5.
[9764.02 → 9768.86] I decided it was too much hassle and kept my Fold 3, which I then promptly dropped in a pool.
[9769.36 → 9771.50] So I've been using my Note 9.
[9772.34 → 9777.30] There was just a long delay between filming and releasing that short circuit because of our production delay.
[9779.46 → 9780.14] All right.
[9780.26 → 9780.52] All right.
[9780.56 → 9781.46] Shall we get into these?
[9781.60 → 9782.32] Let's do it.
[9782.32 → 9784.08] We'll try and get through them nice and quickly.
[9785.26 → 9786.00] Let's see.
[9786.18 → 9787.74] Oh, we've got them moving down.
[9788.54 → 9793.12] Any plans to make a plushier motherboard and case to go with the plushier CPU and GPU?
[9793.42 → 9796.96] No, I think the novelty kind of wore off for people on the plushier CPU.
[9797.08 → 9798.06] It doesn't sell that well anymore.
[9798.30 → 9799.90] So we have some stuff coming.
[9799.96 → 9801.22] We have a plushier VR headset.
[9803.20 → 9804.26] Oh, I saw that.
[9804.32 → 9805.46] Yeah, that's awesome.
[9805.46 → 9806.00] Is that like a clean pillow?
[9807.06 → 9807.32] Nope.
[9808.06 → 9808.32] Oh.
[9808.64 → 9809.58] Not practical at all.
[9809.84 → 9810.10] Ah.
[9810.10 → 9815.26] It's the VR headset for people who get nauseated by actual VR.
[9815.90 → 9816.28] Okay.
[9816.90 → 9817.28] All right.
[9817.44 → 9817.58] Yep.
[9817.66 → 9819.04] It comes with little plushier controllers.
[9819.42 → 9820.48] It's a portable cave.
[9820.58 → 9822.72] The first versions of the controllers were very phallic.
[9824.96 → 9830.60] Well, it's the stitching, you see, because the handle comes to a point and there's a cross stitch right there.
[9830.86 → 9831.06] Yep.
[9831.42 → 9831.68] Yep.
[9831.68 → 9832.74] It looked like a pee hole.
[9833.24 → 9833.44] Ah.
[9835.50 → 9838.30] And the fact that you put your hands on them like this really didn't help.
[9839.14 → 9839.54] Luke.
[9839.54 → 9839.62] Luke.
[9839.84 → 9840.14] Yes.
[9840.24 → 9842.92] Can we get a BG3 update?
[9844.38 → 9845.54] Baldur's Gate 3 update.
[9845.66 → 9846.20] An update?
[9846.38 → 9847.24] They want an update.
[9848.22 → 9848.50] Uh.
[9849.40 → 9849.92] I guess.
[9850.14 → 9850.28] Did.
[9850.94 → 9851.22] Playing?
[9851.70 → 9852.14] Yes?
[9852.70 → 9853.02] Yeah.
[9853.68 → 9854.12] Yeah.
[9854.66 → 9855.12] I don't know.
[9855.16 → 9855.84] I don't know what to say.
[9855.98 → 9857.06] It's great.
[9857.24 → 9858.30] It's absolutely fantastic.
[9858.30 → 9858.90] It's.
[9860.44 → 9865.76] We'll see how Starfield goes in the long run, but it's potentially my game of the year.
[9865.90 → 9867.00] Absolutely amazing game.
[9867.10 → 9868.38] Marian should be extremely proud.
[9868.78 → 9870.58] If you haven't played it yet, I would highly recommend it.
[9871.32 → 9871.96] It's beautiful.
[9872.34 → 9872.90] Work of art.
[9872.90 → 9877.10] What is the maddest you have gotten at a pet?
[9877.28 → 9878.24] What did they do?
[9878.50 → 9879.56] Dan is not a pet.
[9879.94 → 9885.58] I mean, not to you, I guess.
[9886.52 → 9886.92] Won.
[9886.92 → 9887.68] Wow.
[9887.96 → 9888.36] Wow.
[9888.62 → 9888.92] Wow.
[9889.24 → 9889.72] Um.
[9889.92 → 9891.62] Not to me either, to be very clear.
[9891.70 → 9892.50] You might be to someone.
[9893.00 → 9893.68] You don't pay me enough.
[9894.16 → 9894.34] What?
[9894.40 → 9894.54] No.
[9894.66 → 9894.82] I'd be.
[9894.94 → 9895.08] No.
[9895.14 → 9895.50] That's not.
[9895.54 → 9896.50] But that's not my point.
[9896.62 → 9897.14] I'd not say.
[9897.14 → 9901.46] I'm just saying some people's relationships, I don't judge.
[9901.70 → 9902.50] I don't shame.
[9902.84 → 9904.38] Some people have a certain dynamic.
[9904.52 → 9906.28] I'm just saying that we don't know.
[9908.00 → 9909.06] We don't know.
[9909.20 → 9911.20] I don't think I've ever gotten that mad at my pets.
[9912.44 → 9913.20] I have.
[9914.02 → 9915.04] Just train them.
[9915.74 → 9916.30] Uh, well.
[9916.52 → 9916.92] I haven't had cats.
[9917.08 → 9919.12] I've had very stupid pets before.
[9919.28 → 9919.50] Oh.
[9920.08 → 9921.00] So, like.
[9921.00 → 9921.26] What?
[9921.60 → 9922.72] I mean, okay.
[9923.00 → 9923.38] Okay.
[9923.38 → 9925.88] I used to get really mad at my goat.
[9927.14 → 9930.00] Because she would get out because she's a goat.
[9930.36 → 9930.54] Yeah.
[9930.66 → 9931.00] And.
[9931.24 → 9931.46] That makes sense.
[9931.66 → 9936.06] My parents said if she gets out anymore, um, we're going to eat her.
[9936.24 → 9937.20] I remember this story.
[9937.22 → 9937.40] Yeah.
[9937.46 → 9937.90] So, like.
[9937.96 → 9939.44] There was a lot at stake, sir.
[9942.30 → 9942.70] Yeah.
[9942.88 → 9943.38] I know.
[9943.46 → 9943.96] I did that.
[9947.98 → 9949.52] They're a little small to make steaks.
[9949.62 → 9950.42] You don't make goat steaks.
[9950.70 → 9951.66] I've got a story.
[9951.66 → 9956.80] It's not actually being mad at my pet, but it was being mad, and it had something to do with one of my pets.
[9956.80 → 9963.88] But when I was growing up, um, both of our dogs were getting to a very advanced point of age.
[9964.22 → 9964.58] Um.
[9964.58 → 9968.80] So, we knew it was kind of coming, but, um, my parents told me I had a hockey game.
[9970.02 → 9970.42] And.
[9973.00 → 9975.30] This is like pre-online schedules, right?
[9975.42 → 9978.50] So, you're like writing down information you hear from your coach.
[9979.50 → 9979.86] Um.
[9980.02 → 9981.92] So, I was like, man, I really don't think so.
[9982.00 → 9982.36] But, like.
[9983.00 → 9983.36] Okay.
[9983.92 → 9984.52] So, I like.
[9984.76 → 9986.80] And it's kind of sudden and weird.
[9987.08 → 9988.00] Like, there was no, like.
[9988.18 → 9989.80] They tell me the night before or anything.
[9990.00 → 9990.38] And it's like.
[9991.02 → 9991.36] Okay.
[9991.40 → 9992.90] It's kind of like a weird time of day.
[9993.02 → 9993.28] And, like.
[9993.88 → 9995.02] Nothing really seems right.
[9995.16 → 9997.04] But I throw my gear in the, in the van.
[9997.14 → 9998.88] And my dad and I go drive there.
[9998.96 → 10000.20] And we get to the hockey arena.
[10000.20 → 10000.84] And it's.
[10001.38 → 10002.06] Like, abandoned.
[10002.56 → 10003.02] And I'm like.
[10004.04 → 10004.44] What?
[10004.86 → 10006.54] And it was a diversion.
[10007.20 → 10008.40] Because they had to go.
[10009.20 → 10010.42] Put one of our dogs down.
[10011.40 → 10012.86] And he was trying to, like.
[10017.72 → 10019.82] I did not appreciate that.
[10020.10 → 10021.72] I understand what they were trying to do.
[10021.80 → 10022.84] They have since apologized.
[10025.06 → 10028.08] I understand that they were trying to do it over the kindness of their hearts.
[10028.08 → 10030.08] There was no malcontent.
[10030.98 → 10032.38] There was none of that stuff going on.
[10032.68 → 10033.02] Malicious intent.
[10033.04 → 10033.60] Malicious intent.
[10033.70 → 10034.02] There we go.
[10034.04 → 10034.42] Very close.
[10036.36 → 10036.72] Yeah.
[10037.80 → 10039.92] But I hated that.
[10040.12 → 10040.42] Yeah.
[10040.52 → 10040.86] I mean.
[10040.96 → 10041.32] Look.
[10041.40 → 10043.56] I can vouch that Luke's parents.
[10043.96 → 10045.70] From everything that I've heard and seen.
[10046.58 → 10048.06] I wasn't even going to say that.
[10048.08 → 10048.44] Love my parents.
[10048.56 → 10049.80] I was going to say good people.
[10050.08 → 10050.32] Yep.
[10050.36 → 10052.14] That's more than just being a good parent.
[10052.32 → 10053.40] From everything I've seen.
[10053.40 → 10053.60] Good people.
[10053.60 → 10055.02] They are good people.
[10055.66 → 10058.06] And sometimes good people make mistakes.
[10058.08 → 10058.18] Thanks.
[10059.56 → 10060.86] I hated that.
[10060.98 → 10061.36] I hated that.
[10061.36 → 10065.16] There's very, very few things my parents have ever done that I would say that I hated.
[10065.54 → 10066.12] Very few.
[10066.20 → 10067.58] I can't even think of any others at all.
[10068.82 → 10070.36] But I hated that.
[10070.70 → 10071.30] That sucked.
[10072.82 → 10073.18] Yeah.
[10073.46 → 10074.82] And I get it, too.
[10075.02 → 10079.48] Because, like, there's that whole thing you hear when, like, it feels like your kids are aging superfast.
[10079.54 → 10081.96] And maybe if I was a little bit younger, maybe that is what they should have done.
[10082.40 → 10088.52] But at that age, like, I kind of, like, I felt like I needed to experience that, if that makes sense.
[10089.06 → 10091.20] I needed to be there, all that type of stuff.
[10091.52 → 10092.48] So it sucked.
[10092.62 → 10094.42] But, like, I don't know.
[10095.88 → 10097.16] Parents are going to screw up sometimes.
[10097.36 → 10098.00] Like, it's fine.
[10098.08 → 10098.76] It's fine.
[10099.14 → 10100.30] It just sucked.
[10100.88 → 10111.58] We had a really dumb dog that didn't recognize the difference between just, like, running around in the yard and his family being attacked.
[10111.96 → 10116.08] And couldn't seem to figure out, even though I still lived there, that I was part of the family.
[10116.60 → 10126.62] So whenever I would, like, run around with my little brother and, like, you know, or even, like, play fight with him or whatever, he would, like, misunderstand in a big way.
[10126.84 → 10127.22] Which is, like...
[10127.22 → 10127.94] Quite a few dogs.
[10128.24 → 10128.82] It's weird.
[10129.02 → 10130.24] They'll horse around with each other.
[10131.16 → 10132.40] And they'll play fight with each other.
[10132.46 → 10133.98] And they're fine if you play fight with them.
[10134.08 → 10137.94] But the second you play fight with each other as humans, they don't like that.
[10138.20 → 10138.42] Yeah.
[10138.42 → 10141.84] So he would get, like, very aggressive with me.
[10142.50 → 10144.82] And once he bit me so hard he broke skin.
[10144.96 → 10146.50] And I still have a scar on my leg from it.
[10146.52 → 10148.44] So I was pretty mad about that.
[10148.44 → 10148.54] Yeah.
[10148.64 → 10149.34] That makes sense.
[10149.44 → 10150.98] I was like, sir, you need to stop.
[10153.62 → 10155.18] I'm sure that's how you dealt with it.
[10155.38 → 10155.54] Yeah.
[10155.86 → 10156.22] Sir?
[10156.88 → 10158.40] Sir, you're biting my leg, sir.
[10159.28 → 10159.60] Yeah.
[10159.86 → 10162.38] Well, the thing is, like, it was a funny thing.
[10162.42 → 10165.78] Because, like, he knew that I was definitely in charge of him.
[10165.90 → 10169.60] Because, like, when I yelled at him about it, he, like, got it immediately.
[10169.82 → 10170.56] And was like, whoops.
[10170.56 → 10173.62] And this is something we've talked about before, sir.
[10174.14 → 10175.84] So, you know, he knew.
[10176.58 → 10181.98] But he was just kind of dumb and would get kind of, like, riled up.
[10182.30 → 10184.16] And, yeah, very stupid.
[10184.80 → 10185.74] Very stupid dog.
[10185.90 → 10187.26] Not very trainable, by the way.
[10187.68 → 10189.90] Like, I've seen the spectrum.
[10190.54 → 10191.96] We were not good at training.
[10192.32 → 10193.38] I will tell you that much.
[10193.54 → 10197.32] Like, just a family with five kids, you're going to get a lot of inconsistent signals for a dog.
[10197.32 → 10202.94] And my parents had very little interest in animals other than their function on the hobby farm.
[10203.20 → 10203.30] Right?
[10203.38 → 10204.58] Like, so, meh.
[10205.04 → 10209.56] But we saw, I've seen a very smart dog.
[10209.68 → 10212.42] And then I've seen a very stupid dog.
[10212.76 → 10215.26] And basically same environment.
[10216.14 → 10218.82] Some dogs just, yeah.
[10218.82 → 10219.80] Some dogs need more attention.
[10219.80 → 10224.84] I do think the potential for trainability is often higher than people think.
[10224.96 → 10225.98] But it takes time.
[10226.14 → 10229.98] If you ever met Basil, I promise you, you would change your tune.
[10230.22 → 10234.20] I've run into a lot of people's dogs that they said that type of thing about.
[10234.86 → 10238.34] And have had more success than they've had.
[10238.50 → 10240.24] Literally killed by his own stupidity.
[10240.56 → 10240.94] Yeah.
[10241.02 → 10242.10] I do remember that story.
[10242.18 → 10242.34] Yeah.
[10242.86 → 10243.60] That's Basil.
[10243.68 → 10244.12] I don't know.
[10244.42 → 10244.52] Yeah.
[10244.52 → 10245.50] Not a genius.
[10246.04 → 10246.26] Yeah.
[10247.14 → 10247.50] Anywho.
[10247.68 → 10250.22] Yeah, but like, my parents have a Chihuahua.
[10250.24 → 10251.58] Yeah, no, no, I know.
[10251.68 → 10253.18] Not known for being particularly smart.
[10253.32 → 10254.74] Knows tons of tricks, all this kind of stuff.
[10254.92 → 10257.44] But my mom's also like an award-winning dog trainer.
[10257.46 → 10257.74] Yes.
[10258.02 → 10258.76] And all this other stuff.
[10258.84 → 10260.36] So it's like, yeah, yeah.
[10260.66 → 10262.00] It can be way harder.
[10262.10 → 10263.08] I can totally agree with that.
[10263.22 → 10264.34] Barely knew his own name.
[10264.62 → 10267.06] And trust me, we like tried that one.
[10267.06 → 10267.60] Tried on that one, yeah.
[10267.60 → 10270.50] Most dogs will figure out how to come when they're called.
[10270.80 → 10273.32] Like, even if you are a pretty incompetent trainer.
[10273.32 → 10274.10] That is true.
[10274.52 → 10276.28] He was kind.
[10276.90 → 10277.40] That one.
[10277.62 → 10279.08] Not the one that bit my leg.
[10280.04 → 10280.42] Yeah, no.
[10280.68 → 10281.74] Not the roots.
[10282.04 → 10284.94] This dumb one was, he was very kind.
[10285.92 → 10288.90] He absolutely meant well with absolutely everything he did.
[10289.18 → 10291.74] But he couldn't do the right thing to save his life.
[10291.86 → 10293.48] He was just a very, very stupid animal.
[10293.80 → 10293.98] Yeah.
[10295.28 → 10296.16] Anyway, moving on.
[10296.16 → 10302.06] When will we get the WAN DLL pickle to go with the banana for scale?
[10302.90 → 10304.22] Is that what these are?
[10304.22 → 10304.94] Those are cucumbers.
[10305.08 → 10308.28] No, that was for you to take home and enjoy with your family.
[10309.46 → 10311.36] They're, they're, Dan's, no.
[10311.66 → 10312.12] Dan, no.
[10312.52 → 10312.70] No.
[10313.12 → 10313.34] No.
[10313.44 → 10316.04] I meant that in a sweet way, not in a weird way.
[10316.22 → 10317.34] Dan's mom grew those.
[10317.92 → 10319.02] And they're very nice.
[10319.82 → 10320.10] No.
[10320.38 → 10320.84] Stop it.
[10320.98 → 10321.56] Stop it.
[10321.56 → 10322.04] No.
[10322.52 → 10323.24] Stop what?
[10323.30 → 10324.00] I'm looking at them.
[10324.00 → 10324.42] Stop it.
[10324.56 → 10326.36] Do you want the big one or the girth one?
[10326.38 → 10327.66] I'm just holding them in my hands.
[10327.72 → 10328.12] Stop it.
[10329.18 → 10329.84] Both of you.
[10329.98 → 10331.58] I'm just holding both of them in my hands.
[10331.60 → 10332.04] Stop it.
[10332.72 → 10333.86] One of them's for Luke.
[10335.12 → 10335.48] Oh.
[10336.28 → 10336.82] Stop it.
[10336.82 → 10338.64] Do you want to touch my pickle?
[10340.10 → 10341.46] I'm sure you could pickle them.
[10344.96 → 10345.80] Go on, Luke.
[10345.94 → 10346.54] Grab it.
[10349.36 → 10350.18] Oh, both hands.
[10350.22 → 10350.88] He jerked it.
[10351.24 → 10352.10] Oh, my God.
[10352.60 → 10353.78] Jerked it right out of my hand.
[10353.96 → 10354.44] He patted that.
[10354.72 → 10355.26] I'm blushing.
[10355.26 → 10356.00] It's going over here.
[10356.68 → 10357.78] It's safe over there.
[10358.44 → 10358.88] Okay.
[10359.04 → 10359.46] Stop.
[10360.66 → 10361.14] Stop.
[10361.82 → 10362.54] Thank you, Dan.
[10362.74 → 10363.54] You're very welcome.
[10363.76 → 10364.66] I hope you enjoy it.
[10364.74 → 10365.22] They're very good.
[10366.68 → 10367.42] What do we do?
[10367.46 → 10367.98] Oh, God.
[10368.08 → 10368.70] I have a job.
[10369.56 → 10370.12] A high DLL.
[10370.60 → 10372.78] Still patiently waiting for Secret Shopper 3.
[10373.14 → 10377.56] Are there fun April Fool's videos ideas that would have been funny, but you had to scrap?
[10377.56 → 10382.34] Or could you describe the brainstorming process for April Fool's videos?
[10385.42 → 10386.24] I have a couple.
[10386.24 → 10394.84] I'll just delete them from my doc when we're done because I think there's probably at least a couple that I can share with you that are just realistically never going to happen.
[10396.38 → 10400.68] Oh, and in response, no, I haven't finished painting my bike, so it hasn't turned out.
[10400.80 → 10401.78] I will get around to it.
[10402.02 → 10411.24] I think the shop that was working on the disassembly got busy for the summer and I had sort of told them when they took on the job, I didn't really expect them to work on it in the summer.
[10412.08 → 10415.98] Because it's like a kind of big project and kind of stupid project.
[10416.98 → 10422.30] So maybe we'll get back at it very soon, and then I'll get the painting going over the winter and then maybe write it next summer.
[10423.78 → 10424.96] LTT prep schedule?
[10425.08 → 10426.00] No, what is this?
[10426.46 → 10428.22] Where's the video idea tracker doc?
[10428.46 → 10429.02] Hello, buddy?
[10429.60 → 10430.62] See, this is what I'm talking about.
[10430.68 → 10433.46] This phone is like, I pressed back on this document.
[10433.56 → 10435.34] Yeah, there, you finally saw it change.
[10435.34 → 10439.56] Yeah, video idea tracker LTT.
[10439.72 → 10440.28] This is the one.
[10440.92 → 10441.54] Oh my goodness.
[10441.64 → 10446.74] I clicked this doc like three times, and she's thinking about it.
[10446.82 → 10447.02] Hello?
[10447.24 → 10447.76] There we go.
[10448.40 → 10448.74] All right.
[10448.76 → 10449.10] It loaded.
[10449.24 → 10449.72] It loaded this.
[10449.78 → 10451.62] It is a pretty massive doc in fairness.
[10452.18 → 10452.40] All right.
[10452.50 → 10452.84] April.
[10454.58 → 10455.40] April fools.
[10455.40 → 10456.76] Oh, okay.
[10457.14 → 10464.64] This idea I came up with back when that CPU walk in the rain video was sort of fresh on everyone's mind.
[10464.74 → 10468.98] So it's line 102 in this document out of like 900 lines.
[10469.68 → 10471.62] This is just like a general idea doc.
[10471.62 → 10476.64] So it was going to be a parody of like nature walks, except I'm walking around in nature,
[10476.76 → 10479.74] spotting stuff like servers and CPUs and computers.
[10480.80 → 10482.50] You know, kind of throw in a little.
[10482.66 → 10484.24] Like a David Attenborough.
[10484.64 → 10484.88] Yeah.
[10485.02 → 10485.74] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10485.80 → 10485.96] Yeah.
[10486.06 → 10490.04] Yeah, the wild, you know, CPUs are frolicking here.
[10490.14 → 10490.96] You can see there.
[10492.28 → 10493.72] Oh, what's going on now?
[10493.76 → 10495.24] We've got a GPU coming in.
[10495.30 → 10495.40] Yeah.
[10495.46 → 10499.54] Like somewhere between David Attenborough and like crocodile hunter kind of thing.
[10499.76 → 10499.98] Yeah.
[10499.98 → 10502.12] Yeah, that's, that's obvious.
[10502.24 → 10503.76] That is ranked as a D idea.
[10504.24 → 10505.50] D is for doom scroll.
[10506.38 → 10511.70] So if you want to just kind of doom scroll crap ideas and look for a little bit of inspiration,
[10511.88 → 10512.98] that's okay.
[10513.70 → 10514.34] What else we got?
[10515.88 → 10516.90] This is hilarious.
[10516.98 → 10518.24] I'm going to hold on to that one.
[10520.24 → 10521.96] Oh, this is hilarious.
[10522.20 → 10523.38] We might do this one.
[10523.82 → 10525.28] Hey, Luke, what do you think of this one?
[10527.40 → 10528.74] Kind of in the bottom quarter.
[10528.74 → 10530.70] Are your eyes good enough to read that?
[10530.86 → 10532.04] I guess your close-up vision is okay.
[10533.06 → 10533.74] Are you down?
[10535.92 → 10536.98] It'd be a lot of work.
[10540.36 → 10540.68] Wow.
[10541.18 → 10542.20] That would be amazing.
[10542.34 → 10544.10] But yeah, that would be an immense amount of work.
[10544.10 → 10546.46] This was kind of, this was a fun one.
[10546.56 → 10548.42] I don't think we'd ever do this.
[10548.92 → 10549.32] Wait.
[10550.64 → 10551.72] Aren't there people?
[10552.22 → 10555.78] Well, if they were ever not there, it would be funny.
[10556.04 → 10557.24] It could be hilarious, actually.
[10557.24 → 10562.32] This one, April Fool's idea, Intel Extreme Downgrade.
[10562.78 → 10566.14] We go to someone's house and take $5,000 worth of stuff.
[10568.84 → 10569.56] I like that.
[10569.76 → 10570.32] That sounds fun.
[10570.32 → 10572.38] Leave them with like the Ark jersey.
[10573.28 → 10573.46] Yeah.
[10573.90 → 10574.80] Holes in the wall.
[10575.06 → 10576.52] It's just like, oh, man.
[10577.04 → 10578.04] That would be pretty entertaining.
[10578.04 → 10581.28] This is a good one.
[10581.48 → 10582.94] We create the Animator.
[10583.34 → 10585.10] You know that thing that guesses celebrity names?
[10585.54 → 10586.00] Oh, yeah.
[10586.14 → 10587.64] But it gives out tech tips.
[10588.42 → 10592.58] And then, except it's just a massive BS dialogue tree that always spits out the answer.
[10592.66 → 10594.32] Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?
[10596.76 → 10598.00] Okay, I've given you guys enough.
[10598.24 → 10600.78] That's already some like kind of B plus A minus material.
[10600.78 → 10600.80] Oh, man.
[10600.80 → 10601.86] You shouldn't have said that one.
[10601.92 → 10603.68] We should have just done that on one of the websites.
[10603.72 → 10604.22] No, that's fine.
[10604.54 → 10604.98] Yeah, that's okay.
[10605.00 → 10605.80] We got lots of good ideas.
[10605.86 → 10606.10] Don't worry.
[10606.10 → 10608.74] Every time people are like, you guys are out of ideas.
[10608.82 → 10610.18] I'm like, you have no idea.
[10610.50 → 10614.24] We have so many like smart, talented, creative people here.
[10614.32 → 10615.86] There's no shortage of ideas.
[10615.98 → 10617.68] There's a shortage of time to execute them.
[10618.22 → 10619.86] There's no shortage of ideas.
[10620.62 → 10621.98] Jayden wants the downgrade.
[10624.68 → 10626.14] I could use the downgrade.
[10627.14 → 10627.54] Jeez.
[10627.64 → 10629.44] It's just like a garbage removal.
[10629.44 → 10631.84] Get rid of my stuff, please.
[10632.86 → 10633.92] Just take it.
[10634.00 → 10634.44] Too much.
[10634.54 → 10635.92] I got too much crap.
[10637.10 → 10638.38] Okay, moving on.
[10638.88 → 10644.88] With the excitement of a new Bethesda game, I wanted to ask what was the worst bug you have encountered in a video game?
[10646.50 → 10649.18] I mean, worst is like if it just doesn't launch.
[10649.32 → 10649.84] Yeah, I don't.
[10650.38 → 10653.40] That's one of my things with Bethesda bugs is they're usually just funny.
[10653.98 → 10656.44] Non-progression is always really frustrating.
[10656.66 → 10657.10] That's not funny.
[10657.38 → 10657.52] Yeah.
[10657.96 → 10659.30] Oh, I know the worst for me.
[10659.40 → 10659.64] Okay.
[10659.98 → 10660.28] Do you?
[10661.04 → 10670.16] I mean, I was just thinking of the time I got really deep into Final Fantasy Tactics and I happened to build my main character as like kind of a lightweight.
[10670.16 → 10672.30] Like he wasn't a wasn't big D.
[10672.30 → 10673.50] He was like a support class.
[10673.66 → 10676.38] So he wasn't heavy DPS, and he didn't have a lot of HP.
[10676.38 → 10687.16] And you get to this stupid fight with, I think, Geography or something like that where he one-on-ones your main character until your main character can unlock the door to let in the rest of your party.
[10687.16 → 10688.80] And I would just get one hit.
[10688.92 → 10690.46] I couldn't even get across the room.
[10691.06 → 10704.10] And so because I didn't, because I didn't follow, you know, retro game save protocol and have multiple water falling saves or whatever you would call that.
[10704.10 → 10708.32] Like I didn't use all my save slots and then overwrite as I went.
[10709.22 → 10715.22] I just, I, there was no equipment and no class changes that I could make to him to survive this.
[10715.26 → 10717.02] And it was a non-progression problem.
[10717.12 → 10718.94] It's not really like a bug, but it sucks.
[10719.80 → 10721.08] I have, I have two.
[10721.78 → 10733.08] One of them, I was playing COM Iron Man or whatever it's called, where when people die, it's permanent, and you only have one version of the save of your game.
[10733.08 → 10736.44] So you can't like save scum to get someone back if they die.
[10737.26 → 10739.50] It's like a hardcore version of COM.
[10739.58 → 10740.46] This was years ago.
[10742.32 → 10745.20] And I got to the very final mission.
[10746.18 → 10753.94] And for some reason, opening the door to the boss's room would crash my game 100% of the time.
[10754.08 → 10755.36] I tried it on different computers.
[10755.56 → 10757.72] I tried it on different versions of Windows.
[10757.80 → 10758.48] I tried everything.
[10759.02 → 10760.56] Could not progress from that point.
[10763.08 → 10773.54] So I just watched a let's play of someone beating the game and was like, all right, I guess that's it.
[10773.84 → 10776.06] Because I wasn't going to play through the entire thing again.
[10776.52 → 10778.68] Because it removes all your previous saves.
[10778.74 → 10779.66] You only have one save.
[10780.20 → 10783.54] So I was just like, okay, I like, I made it here.
[10784.26 → 10786.08] OMFG Mine 2 killed me.
[10786.08 → 10787.64] Yeah.
[10788.86 → 10789.18] Yeah.
[10789.46 → 10791.60] So I guess this was like a thing.
[10791.72 → 10792.56] It's been too many years.
[10792.62 → 10794.60] I don't remember like if I Googled it, and it was a thing or not.
[10794.66 → 10796.58] But like, yeah, I couldn't get into the boss's room.
[10796.64 → 10799.54] And that was really disappointing because that felt like quite an accomplishment.
[10799.92 → 10802.06] And then the other one was Outer Worlds.
[10803.00 → 10805.62] Outer Wilds and Outer Worlds came out at a very similar time.
[10805.92 → 10807.32] Outer Worlds was an amazing game.
[10807.48 → 10808.40] I loved it.
[10808.40 → 10810.04] And there's one room.
[10810.38 → 10813.48] If I open the room, the whole game crashes.
[10814.28 → 10816.48] And I've tried it different GPUs.
[10816.52 → 10818.22] I thought it was a driver error for a while.
[10818.50 → 10822.16] I tried different GPUs, different versions of Windows, different computers, everything.
[10822.36 → 10824.26] Again, nope, doesn't work.
[10824.66 → 10827.00] And it's just like, man, I've never gone back to the game.
[10827.06 → 10828.36] I really enjoyed playing it.
[10828.64 → 10829.54] Perfect game.
[10829.86 → 10831.38] But I got a non-progression bug.
[10831.48 → 10832.22] I was just like, okay.
[10832.40 → 10833.26] I like Joe's answer.
[10834.20 → 10834.48] Markov.
[10834.48 → 10835.74] Markov is one giant frustrating bug.
[10835.82 → 10836.42] That is accurate.
[10836.42 → 10839.32] I can't bring myself to play it anymore.
[10839.42 → 10842.08] I think the Cheater Exposé actually just broke it for me.
[10843.46 → 10844.52] So, I don't know.
[10845.40 → 10846.08] They had a wipe.
[10846.60 → 10847.50] I tried playing.
[10848.34 → 10850.30] I think I got a couple of hours into it.
[10850.36 → 10851.26] And I was just like, no.
[10852.52 → 10853.90] There's also too many other good games.
[10853.98 → 10855.16] I didn't even mention this one.
[10855.36 → 10856.58] We've been talking about good games.
[10857.40 → 10858.06] Battle Bit.
[10859.24 → 10859.60] Yeah.
[10859.76 → 10860.78] Battle Bit's awesome.
[10860.94 → 10863.82] Yeah, Alex Clark was telling me that I need to play it.
[10863.90 → 10864.56] And I was like...
[10864.56 → 10865.58] Battle Bit's really fun.
[10865.58 → 10866.36] It's all the good...
[10866.36 → 10868.62] It's all the things that made Battlefield good back in the day.
[10869.50 → 10871.14] Yeah, it has like weird Roblox graphics.
[10871.34 → 10873.70] But I mean, at least they're able to develop it more easily.
[10874.08 → 10874.28] Yeah.
[10874.34 → 10875.06] It's pretty cheap.
[10875.16 → 10877.48] And it runs amazingly well.
[10877.60 → 10878.60] This is what I talk about.
[10879.06 → 10879.46] Spreadsheets.
[10879.84 → 10881.08] Games are just spreadsheets.
[10881.50 → 10884.84] If the game is good, it doesn't matter what it looks like.
[10884.90 → 10885.12] Yeah.
[10885.32 → 10885.56] Right?
[10885.76 → 10886.54] Yeah, totally agree.
[10886.86 → 10887.24] Absolutely.
[10887.42 → 10888.60] It can look like whatever.
[10888.98 → 10890.46] But the core loop is there.
[10890.56 → 10891.94] And the progression is there.
[10892.04 → 10893.92] Battle Bit is fundamentally fun.
[10893.92 → 10896.62] It's fundamentally a good game.
[10896.82 → 10896.94] That's the important part.
[10896.94 → 10897.84] I enjoy it.
[10897.84 → 10897.90] And that's where...
[10897.90 → 10901.36] This is my core tenant when I do games is aesthetics don't matter.
[10901.54 → 10904.90] And it pisses off a lot of people because they don't understand that it actually really does matter.
[10905.20 → 10908.84] But if the game isn't fun to play, it's not a game.
[10909.16 → 10909.38] Yeah.
[10909.38 → 10909.92] It's bad.
[10910.08 → 10910.20] Yeah.
[10910.24 → 10913.80] And like if Battle Bit looked better, that would be sweet.
[10914.26 → 10915.48] Tell us how you really feel, Dan.
[10915.76 → 10916.30] But like...
[10916.30 → 10917.16] I used to play EVE Online.
[10917.16 → 10918.24] I don't get to have comments.
[10919.42 → 10920.22] I did too.
[10920.92 → 10922.00] Did you like to watch movies?
[10924.04 → 10925.66] What's it like playing EVE Online?
[10925.88 → 10926.90] Well, you watch movies.
[10928.12 → 10929.40] I've seen a lot of movies.
[10931.56 → 10931.92] Yeah.
[10931.98 → 10932.36] I don't know.
[10932.50 → 10934.34] I played like back in OG days.
[10934.46 → 10935.16] So there was no...
[10936.04 → 10937.84] I only had one monitor and all that kind of stuff.
[10938.04 → 10938.88] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10938.92 → 10939.90] I also played more recently.
[10940.06 → 10940.64] But anyway.
[10940.90 → 10941.26] Anyway.
[10941.44 → 10941.86] Moving on.
[10941.86 → 10946.00] Linus, how have you been liking your Eco bee thermostat?
[10946.34 → 10947.86] I don't care about anything smart home.
[10947.96 → 10951.52] I just want to be lazy and control my thermostat from my phone.
[10951.94 → 10953.52] They keep disconnecting from my Wi-Fi.
[10953.92 → 10954.66] It's super annoying.
[10955.28 → 10958.56] I don't know that that's necessarily the Eco bee's fault.
[10959.20 → 10962.80] But what I do know is that getting them reconnected is kind of a pain in the butt.
[10963.08 → 10968.26] If I go and I just key in the password and click connect, it won't do it.
[10968.44 → 10971.20] I have to go get an iPhone, not an Android phone.
[10971.20 → 10972.22] I have to go get an iPhone.
[10972.40 → 10975.20] And I have to go through the connection process on the iPhone.
[10975.34 → 10976.34] And then it'll work every time.
[10977.52 → 10978.62] So that's...
[10978.62 → 10985.08] It's clearly one of those for Apple users first and for everyone else, I guess, you exist as well,
[10985.22 → 10987.64] products from my experience with it.
[10988.74 → 10990.06] When they work, they work great.
[10992.00 → 10997.26] But, you know, it's probably not helping matters that their integration with Home Assistant is kind of clunky
[10997.26 → 10998.48] and the way we're working with...
[10998.48 → 10999.98] The way that we're using them is kind of hacky.
[10999.98 → 11006.46] So I think out of my nine, I think it is, six are still connected over the summer while I haven't been using them
[11006.46 → 11007.86] because I only use them for heat.
[11008.12 → 11011.18] So I have to, like, get a few of them reconnected and blah, blah, blah.
[11011.38 → 11012.22] So, and...
[11012.22 → 11018.18] First time stubby screwdriver buyer.
[11018.38 → 11019.72] I mean, yeah, they are new.
[11019.72 → 11025.54] I'm in search of high quality socks to buy while waiting for the LDT socks to release.
[11025.88 → 11027.36] What's your go-to sock brand?
[11027.88 → 11028.44] Darn tough.
[11029.72 → 11030.52] Don't ask Luke's.
[11030.54 → 11031.12] It's not as good.
[11031.62 → 11031.94] Icebreaker.
[11033.12 → 11033.92] They're not as good.
[11034.14 → 11034.70] I like them.
[11034.82 → 11035.26] I know you like them.
[11035.26 → 11036.22] I need to write that down, too.
[11036.24 → 11037.14] I didn't say you don't like them.
[11037.18 → 11037.96] I said they're not as good.
[11037.96 → 11044.04] I said, objectively, like our materials' person was like, how the F about the darn tough socks?
[11044.12 → 11045.04] They're, like, really amazing.
[11045.90 → 11048.36] I don't know that having more materials makes it better.
[11049.00 → 11050.12] It's not the more materials.
[11050.36 → 11052.78] It's, like, the design is the composition of them.
[11052.86 → 11053.94] They're just, like, amazing.
[11053.94 → 11061.90] The machine, she was saying that there are maybe a handful of machines on Earth that can weave like that.
[11064.80 → 11069.50] If anyone knows anyone who works at Darn Tough, we have had a heck of a time.
[11069.60 → 11075.64] We would love to just co-brand with them at this point rather than trying to make our own socks.
[11076.36 → 11080.70] Because I'm just, I'm unwilling to put a sock on the store that I can't stand behind.
[11080.70 → 11087.20] And now that I've experienced Darn Tough socks, I just can't enjoy anything else.
[11088.06 → 11088.60] Luke can.
[11088.70 → 11090.72] He likes his icebreakers, and I'm really happy for him.
[11090.74 → 11091.96] I've also never had Darn Tough socks.
[11092.32 → 11093.68] But I do really like my icebreakers.
[11093.90 → 11099.00] And my icebreakers are a lot better than the demo prototype pair of socks that I tried on.
[11099.32 → 11099.54] Yeah.
[11099.82 → 11100.28] Yes, they are.
[11100.28 → 11100.82] They just are.
[11100.82 → 11101.16] Yeah.
[11101.16 → 11107.32] So those were an early version of ones that we were trying to come out with and just were not good enough.
[11107.32 → 11109.66] I'm happy we didn't go forward with those, to be honest.
[11109.66 → 11110.10] Nope.
[11110.10 → 11110.48] Because, yeah.
[11110.54 → 11110.80] I know.
[11111.14 → 11111.48] I know.
[11111.56 → 11112.58] They weren't good enough.
[11113.38 → 11114.18] We kept trying.
[11114.34 → 11117.12] And to be clear, there are lots of different versions of our, like, proto socks.
[11117.30 → 11120.38] Some of them were probably better than what you have, but none of them were good enough.
[11122.16 → 11123.22] And, oh, yeah.
[11123.32 → 11126.04] Something to note is Darn Tough socks are super expensive.
[11126.24 → 11128.22] They're like 20 US dollars a pair.
[11129.40 → 11130.44] So I'm not necessarily...
[11130.44 → 11131.64] Icebreakers are really expensive, too.
[11131.68 → 11132.94] I don't remember how much they are, but...
[11132.94 → 11133.20] Yeah.
[11133.48 → 11134.90] I'm not even recommending them.
[11135.16 → 11135.62] It hurts.
[11135.62 → 11136.04] It hurts to buy.
[11136.04 → 11137.40] I'm just saying they're perfect.
[11137.60 → 11139.54] I mean, if you're going to wear them for, like, 10, 20 years.
[11139.66 → 11139.86] You know?
[11140.26 → 11144.22] That's one of the things with why I bought this is because, like, I had a previous pair.
[11144.26 → 11146.52] I bought one pair for hiking back in the day.
[11147.28 → 11149.20] And I still have that pair.
[11149.28 → 11153.14] And I bought those, I think, eight or nine years ago.
[11153.76 → 11154.84] And they're still great.
[11155.30 → 11156.26] Literally wore them yesterday.
[11156.64 → 11157.64] So, yeah.
[11157.68 → 11158.08] I don't know.
[11158.22 → 11159.10] And to be clear...
[11159.10 → 11161.36] Literally right now.
[11162.44 → 11164.86] You're not even necessarily talking 10 years with them.
[11164.86 → 11170.70] But the way that I wear through socks, like, I could wear through those, like, Stupid Champion Costco ones.
[11171.00 → 11172.74] They downgraded them significantly.
[11172.90 → 11174.62] The old ones were perfect.
[11175.04 → 11181.96] And then the ones that they have now, or at least the last time I looked at them, are garbage.
[11182.54 → 11186.18] And I would wear through them in, like, maybe five or six badminton sessions.
[11186.40 → 11187.60] I would have a hole in the big toe.
[11187.94 → 11189.24] Or even, like, in the...
[11189.24 → 11190.62] Whatever the...
[11190.62 → 11191.08] I don't know.
[11191.12 → 11191.52] What is that?
[11191.56 → 11192.58] It's not the heel of the foot.
[11192.66 → 11193.84] It's, like, here, the ball.
[11194.02 → 11194.86] In the ball of the foot.
[11198.16 → 11198.80] From sliding.
[11198.90 → 11199.28] From friction.
[11199.76 → 11200.06] Arch?
[11200.18 → 11201.78] Are you talking about where your arch is?
[11201.82 → 11202.74] No, the ball of the foot.
[11202.92 → 11203.22] Okay.
[11203.36 → 11204.82] So, behind the toes.
[11204.88 → 11205.06] Yeah.
[11205.22 → 11206.14] Like, padding behind the toes.
[11206.14 → 11207.52] Behind the toes, but before the arch.
[11207.62 → 11207.86] Yes.
[11207.98 → 11208.12] Yeah.
[11209.36 → 11211.32] Like, seriously, five or six wears.
[11211.72 → 11215.38] Whereas, darn tough, I can get easily, like, 25 to 50.
[11216.22 → 11219.76] They do have a lifetime warranty, but it's good for one time.
[11219.98 → 11221.84] So, you don't just have socks for life.
[11222.82 → 11228.64] But, given that I know that I will wear through every single one of them, the cost is effectively $12 per a pair of socks.
[11228.78 → 11233.42] And they're really comfortable, and they're really breathable, and I don't have to, like, go replace them all the time, which is annoying.
[11233.42 → 11233.50] Interesting.
[11238.20 → 11241.36] Christopher S. says, Luke, would you be interested in a Boeing factory tour?
[11241.46 → 11242.14] The answer is yes.
[11242.24 → 11243.20] If so, hit me up.
[11243.28 → 11247.80] I have no idea how you want them to contact you, though, so I curated this, but I can archive it now.
[11248.12 → 11251.14] Annoyingly, because I don't like Twitter, that's actually the easiest way.
[11252.08 → 11252.64] Okay, yeah.
[11252.66 → 11253.86] So, you can hit them up on X.
[11254.56 → 11254.82] Yeah.
[11255.00 → 11255.94] Or that thing, I guess.
[11256.20 → 11256.38] Yeah.
[11258.08 → 11261.16] It's going to be one of those things where I start out calling it that because I'm Memling.
[11261.48 → 11262.70] And then it'll just keep going.
[11262.70 → 11263.94] And then I just keep doing it.
[11264.50 → 11265.18] Like GIFs.
[11267.02 → 11268.40] No, no, GIF is just correct.
[11270.38 → 11271.20] Deal with it.
[11273.92 → 11275.26] Hi, DLL from the UK.
[11275.66 → 11285.78] Luke, as a fellow CTO, do you have any examples of where you have changed or added a process and been surprised by the impact it had made on productivity, good or bad?
[11285.78 → 11288.50] With the CTO hat.
[11288.50 → 11292.68] I don't think I've really been in it long enough to do that.
[11292.76 → 11295.92] The main thing we've been doing is like, oh, my God, look at the state of everything.
[11296.06 → 11305.64] We're actually working on potentially prepping a video for you guys, for the writer people of like, wow, this was the state of infrastructure.
[11305.64 → 11305.76] Sure.
[11307.14 → 11313.18] I thought of this idea because he's off probation now, but I don't know if he wants me saying his name publicly.
[11313.46 → 11314.42] But the new IT guy.
[11314.80 → 11315.14] Oh, yeah.
[11315.14 → 11318.06] We should ask because I'll ask him.
[11318.06 → 11319.44] I think people would be like pretty.
[11319.82 → 11320.18] Really?
[11320.52 → 11321.82] You know if they found out.
[11321.82 → 11323.42] Actually, yes, that'd be cool.
[11323.90 → 11326.30] I'll make sure I ask him at some point.
[11327.32 → 11330.80] But he pulled out, I believe, was it a switch, Dan?
[11331.76 → 11334.06] Yes, it was a network switch.
[11334.34 → 11335.04] That is correct.
[11335.16 → 11337.34] It was an old water-cooled networking switch.
[11337.36 → 11338.44] What was wrong with that?
[11338.80 → 11344.20] Oh, you know, it's probably the most corroded thing I've ever seen in my life and was also out of water.
[11344.50 → 11344.92] Corroded?
[11345.24 → 11345.54] Yeah.
[11345.66 → 11346.38] What do you mean by corroded?
[11346.86 → 11349.10] Didn't Elijah almost throw up?
[11349.10 → 11349.54] Hyper gunned.
[11349.54 → 11354.22] He unscrewed the top of the res and then smelt it and apparently almost threw up.
[11354.70 → 11354.86] Oh.
[11355.88 → 11358.18] And that was running in production, boys!
[11358.58 → 11361.88] It was sitting behind Andy's desk for the entire time I've worked here.
[11362.92 → 11366.12] Someone probably should have put some extra water in there and maybe some biocide at some point.
[11366.24 → 11369.64] I'm scared to unplug it because you don't turn off equipment like that.
[11369.74 → 11373.44] So we're going to see if we can find more things in that realm.
[11375.22 → 11378.00] That'll probably be the headliner because that's pretty amazing.
[11379.54 → 11380.52] But yeah, I don't know.
[11380.56 → 11385.56] I don't have a great answer for you because it's been like a low amount of months at this point.
[11390.04 → 11391.40] But yeah, sorry.
[11391.70 → 11392.04] I don't know.
[11392.70 → 11395.28] Long time fan, first time merch messenger.
[11395.68 → 11400.30] I'm visiting Vancouver next spring and was wondering if there were any badminton updates to share.
[11400.30 → 11403.30] My local court is outside and closes in October.
[11404.02 → 11408.30] Vaughn and I realistically do not have time to run that business.
[11408.52 → 11410.08] So we're really hoping to...
[11410.08 → 11419.08] We're going to cast out the net again, and we're hoping to find a really solid applicant who basically wants to just kind of run a badminton centre business.
[11419.60 → 11421.62] And I get to play there sometimes.
[11421.62 → 11427.42] Yeah, that's about where we're at right now.
[11428.12 → 11434.76] We're even having a lot of questions where it would be highly beneficial if it was someone who had literally run a badminton centre before.
[11435.12 → 11439.42] Because we were trying to figure out what software solution do we use for online booking and stuff.
[11439.68 → 11441.62] And there's a billion options.
[11441.62 → 11448.46] Yeah, it's amazing how many options there are because every Pilates studio has to handle the same kinds of bookings things.
[11448.62 → 11464.62] So of course there's like a zillion software as a service company for all these zillions X some factor like martial arts studios and yoga.
[11464.62 → 11465.62] Fitness and dance.
[11465.62 → 11467.26] Fitness and dance and ribbon.
[11467.26 → 11468.84] Cooking education stuff.
[11468.94 → 11469.96] Whatever, gymnastics.
[11469.96 → 11478.50] And a lot of them have really adversarial business models and like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11479.10 → 11482.00] It's, yeah, it's kind of not great.
[11482.44 → 11484.48] But, oh well, next up.
[11485.02 → 11487.04] Using up some of that alpaca wool.
[11487.40 → 11490.66] Linus and Luke, have you seen Sanctuary Shattered Sun?
[11490.90 → 11494.68] It looks like it's going to be the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander.
[11494.68 → 11502.64] Yeah, the devs actually reached out to me a while back, and they were at a kind of fundraising stage.
[11503.02 → 11509.22] And I basically said like, look, I am very interested in the game.
[11509.74 → 11512.42] Everything I've seen out of it looks amazing.
[11512.98 → 11518.60] But I don't know anything about the gaming industry compared to what I know about the hardware industry.
[11518.60 → 11522.00] I wouldn't really be able to be like an activist investor.
[11522.12 → 11525.98] I wouldn't really be able to like open any doors for you or anything like that.
[11526.40 → 11529.32] I was also fresh off of the investment into Framework.
[11529.42 → 11535.18] So I wasn't really looking to throw more money into a furnace because at that time that was really how that felt.
[11535.98 → 11540.70] Not because I didn't love the mission, but just because I didn't have a lot of faith in the mission.
[11540.70 → 11544.82] Since then, man, I've told Framework.
[11545.00 → 11546.78] I'm like, we talked about this on WAN Show.
[11547.52 → 11550.02] So I told them, yeah, the community is down.
[11550.18 → 11553.66] So if you guys like need more money, I'm potentially interested.
[11553.98 → 11556.34] Not that I really have any right now because of the Badminton Centre.
[11556.40 → 11559.64] But you never know, you know, if the timing, if the timing's right, you know, maybe there's something.
[11560.26 → 11562.54] But with Sanctuary Shattered Sun, the timing just wasn't good.
[11562.88 → 11566.46] But the game looks super cool.
[11566.46 → 11571.38] It's like kind of like you said, spiritual successor to Supreme Commander, but with a lot of new quality of life improvements.
[11571.38 → 11572.70] Should be way better performance.
[11573.26 → 11576.36] Like Supreme Commander doesn't really support multithreading.
[11576.70 → 11585.80] So when you've got like a couple of thousand units on the field, unless everyone has a 13900K, you are having a pretty bad time.
[11585.84 → 11586.98] And I'm exaggerating a little bit.
[11586.98 → 11600.82] But one player in an eight-player match that has a subpar CPU is going to slow down the simulation speed for everybody because all the combat is physics-based.
[11601.42 → 11606.42] Every projectile flying through the air is simulated as opposed to just being like a die roll.
[11607.58 → 11608.80] So it's pretty heavy.
[11609.74 → 11610.98] Yeah, I'd be super.
[11611.72 → 11613.24] I'm ready to play it.
[11613.36 → 11614.00] I'm very excited.
[11614.00 → 11621.90] Was wondering if you guys ever had any trouble with the USB reset bug Ry zen used to have or still has.
[11622.40 → 11624.74] Both my systems have constantly crashing USB.
[11625.16 → 11627.82] Sadly, made my mind to leave AMD for good.
[11628.34 → 11629.12] Also stubby!
[11631.30 → 11635.60] Sorry, I just accidentally archived one where someone suggested putting the kids in Scouts.
[11636.14 → 11637.22] We haven't.
[11637.30 → 11638.54] They already have too many activities.
[11639.00 → 11641.00] As for the AMD USB bug...
[11642.22 → 11643.42] Oh, you didn't archive that.
[11643.42 → 11644.22] I curated it.
[11645.00 → 11645.24] Oh.
[11645.72 → 11646.04] All right.
[11646.10 → 11646.80] Well, there's the answer.
[11646.94 → 11647.74] Now I'm archiving it.
[11651.12 → 11651.52] No.
[11651.76 → 11653.40] I haven't had trouble with it personally.
[11654.08 → 11655.32] At least that I know of.
[11655.40 → 11657.92] I've encountered some other really frustrating AMD bugs.
[11658.04 → 11661.82] There's a sleep bug on Thread ripper that just makes your CPU...
[11661.82 → 11662.36] Excuse me.
[11662.40 → 11664.88] Makes your system blue screen when your CPU is not doing anything.
[11665.60 → 11667.30] Specifically when your CPU is idle.
[11667.30 → 11668.44] It's like...
[11668.44 → 11671.60] As if I didn't feel abandoned enough on this platform already, AMD.
[11671.74 → 11672.52] Thank you very much.
[11672.52 → 11672.82] I feel seen.
[11673.18 → 11676.68] I've had it lock at 1 gigahertz before for ages.
[11677.04 → 11678.20] And you just can't do anything.
[11678.60 → 11679.10] Frustrating.
[11679.28 → 11682.22] But no, I haven't seen this particular bug.
[11683.20 → 11684.36] Enjoy your stubby screwdriver though.
[11684.36 → 11686.46] Hi, Linus and Luke.
[11686.54 → 11693.86] How long would you say a flagship system should last in regard to being able to play the latest AAA titles at max settings?
[11693.86 → 11696.34] This is a fascinating question.
[11696.44 → 11705.32] I curated this one because I wanted to talk about how that is unfortunately just not how it works.
[11705.66 → 11709.98] And I'm going to use game consoles as an analogy here.
[11710.34 → 11716.48] It's kind of like asking, how many years should you get out of a game console before it's time to upgrade?
[11716.48 → 11727.06] There are so many variables that are going to affect this time frame that are completely outside your control and that you cannot predict.
[11727.58 → 11730.42] Nobody knows when the next game console is coming.
[11730.94 → 11737.00] Nobody knows how long developers are going to keep releasing games for it past its successor's release date.
[11737.58 → 11738.94] Nobody knows...
[11738.94 → 11741.78] Well, I guess, yeah, those are the two biggest factors.
[11741.78 → 11749.80] And then on the PC side of things, nobody knows what your tolerance is for lowering settings.
[11749.92 → 11752.62] Maybe to you, high is max settings.
[11753.36 → 11755.48] Whereas for someone else, maybe it's ultra.
[11755.84 → 11759.98] Maybe to you, if it doesn't run at 4K resolution, it ain't worth shit.
[11760.24 → 11768.00] Whereas maybe to someone else, well, they're more than happy with higher detail levels, but at 1440p or at 1080p.
[11768.00 → 11774.94] Maybe you're comfortable using AI upscaling, whereas maybe they are like native resolution or bust.
[11775.28 → 11778.40] So it's one of those questions that is so personal.
[11778.80 → 11784.00] You could buy a top-of-the-line system, okay, right before a new generation...
[11784.54 → 11791.16] Okay, if you bought a top-of-the-line system right before NVIDIA launched the 30 series, you'd feel like you got ripped.
[11791.62 → 11791.74] Yeah.
[11791.74 → 11798.24] Like they came in, stomped all over 20 series for performance, were really aggressively priced at first.
[11798.48 → 11798.70] Yeah.
[11799.02 → 11804.60] And then if you bought a 3080 Ti or something like that, or I forget what the actual launch lineup was.
[11804.64 → 11805.16] A 3090.
[11805.26 → 11809.80] If you bought a 3090 at launch, man, you are sitting tight still.
[11810.56 → 11812.26] You are still playing everything.
[11812.26 → 11816.08] So it's hard to say.
[11816.20 → 11819.00] Whereas if you had bought, yeah, if you'd bought like a...
[11819.00 → 11823.94] Yeah, if you bought like a 10 series top-of-the-line, you got a long life out of that.
[11823.98 → 11829.88] If you bought a 20 series top-of-the-line, I mean, it was fine, but was really superseded in a big way by 30 series.
[11829.96 → 11833.08] And then if you bought a 30 series, you're like sitting tight all the way through 40 series.
[11833.16 → 11834.32] So it really depends.
[11835.44 → 11835.94] And it also...
[11835.94 → 11838.84] Right, it also depends on what's going on more broadly in the gaming industry.
[11838.84 → 11845.92] Like all of a sudden, we're getting all of these super heavy titles that are pushing 3090s, 4080s to their limit, right?
[11846.54 → 11847.02] Well, why?
[11847.16 → 11853.66] Well, it's because we're getting all these games that are developed to run at 4K30 on a new generation of consoles.
[11853.92 → 11858.00] And as PC gamers, we're expecting them to run at 60 or 120 FPS.
[11858.38 → 11864.84] So all of a sudden, PC gamers are going, wow, man, this card that ran everything for all these years,
[11864.84 → 11870.20] when everything was designed to run on the Xbox One X or the PlayStation 4,
[11870.44 → 11872.40] all of a sudden it's being pushed to the limit.
[11872.54 → 11876.92] It's like, yeah, because there's next generation games that are coming out by the truckload right now.
[11880.16 → 11880.92] So I don't know.
[11881.94 → 11883.74] It's totally up to you, I'm afraid.
[11883.74 → 11887.74] I do think that now is a pretty okay time to buy.
[11887.96 → 11889.70] Prices have fallen in a big way.
[11889.84 → 11893.94] I hope that the basement for GPUs is going to be lower.
[11894.50 → 11901.00] But CPUs are pretty darn approachable right now, especially with how cheap RAM is.
[11901.98 → 11904.34] Like platform upgrades are pretty good right now.
[11904.60 → 11906.72] And yeah, GPUs, there are some deals to be had.
[11906.88 → 11910.18] And hey, there might be some new stuff coming that'll be pretty attractive as well.
[11910.18 → 11915.28] Linus, as someone in the business space,
[11915.40 → 11917.92] what are your thoughts on the value of staying loyal to an employer
[11917.92 → 11920.26] versus chasing better positions externally?
[11920.80 → 11926.10] I think that anyone honest is going to tell you that you are going to want to,
[11926.26 → 11933.50] at some regular interval, at least consider whether your current situation is the right one for you.
[11933.94 → 11935.26] We do it as a company.
[11935.26 → 11938.22] Every year, we meet with everyone.
[11938.22 → 11945.94] And before we do that, we meet with the exec team to kind of reevaluate, to rethink,
[11946.04 → 11952.26] to kind of go, okay, is LMG the best place for this person who we want to retain?
[11952.68 → 11958.30] If it might not be, how do we consider how to make it be?
[11958.30 → 11968.14] And I think that people should be having those same thoughts on their own at least that cadence,
[11968.32 → 11969.92] if that kind of makes sense.
[11969.92 → 11976.50] I do think if the answer is that you might want to go elsewhere, depending on the reason,
[11977.64 → 11979.92] I would make sure that you have that conversation with your...
[11980.44 → 11984.06] If you would like to stay where you're at, I'll say that.
[11984.60 → 11984.76] Yeah.
[11984.76 → 11986.50] Because that gets over the depending on the reason part.
[11986.72 → 11990.06] If you would like to stay where you're at, but you're feeling like it's not working out for whatever reason,
[11990.14 → 11992.32] I would make sure that you're having those conversations internally.
[11992.32 → 11999.40] I can't speak for every company, but anything is a relationship at the end of the day of some sort.
[11999.46 → 12000.76] It could be a toxic relationship.
[12000.92 → 12003.94] It could be a frosty relationship, but it is a relationship.
[12004.26 → 12008.92] And if you want a frosty relationship, like a cool one, like you're not close.
[12009.10 → 12009.68] Ah, gotcha.
[12009.70 → 12009.86] Yeah.
[12010.26 → 12015.80] But if you're in a relationship, and you have any desire whatsoever for it to continue,
[12016.44 → 12017.54] communication is key.
[12020.14 → 12020.62] Yeah.
[12020.62 → 12020.66] Yeah.
[12021.42 → 12023.36] So both sides should be...
[12023.36 → 12031.64] And you might want to stay there, but that company is just, you know, they're unable to meet what you need.
[12031.70 → 12033.50] And that's just life that happens sometimes.
[12033.68 → 12033.88] Yeah.
[12033.94 → 12035.62] Or it could go the other way around sometimes.
[12035.90 → 12044.46] I think one of the few really wise things that I learned from the actual big boss at NCI,
[12044.64 → 12047.60] the smartest thing I think he ever said to me, or the most...
[12047.60 → 12048.46] I'll put it this way.
[12048.46 → 12054.60] The most perspective changing thing he ever said to me was, nobody stays at the same company forever.
[12055.48 → 12058.08] It was when I was on my way out the door already.
[12058.24 → 12059.54] I was quitting.
[12059.54 → 12061.42] I had made it clear that I was...
[12061.42 → 12062.26] I intended to leave.
[12062.84 → 12065.74] And, you know, he tried to renegotiate once.
[12066.06 → 12069.32] And when I basically said firmly, no, I am...
[12069.32 → 12070.42] This is my intention.
[12070.76 → 12071.84] Option A or option B.
[12071.92 → 12074.64] I either go to a competitor or you sell me the channel.
[12075.20 → 12076.22] We work out a deal.
[12076.72 → 12078.04] He basically went, okay.
[12079.02 → 12080.46] And we moved on.
[12080.56 → 12081.52] He didn't linger there.
[12081.52 → 12082.20] And I kind of...
[12082.20 → 12082.90] I asked him later.
[12082.98 → 12086.16] I was like, you didn't, like, counteroffer more.
[12086.92 → 12091.02] And he's like, well, nobody stays at the same company forever.
[12092.16 → 12094.24] Or, like, nobody works at the same place forever.
[12094.36 → 12099.72] And it's like, it was really perspective changing for me because I had never really thought about it that way.
[12099.78 → 12104.26] To me, NCI was the only place that I had ever really enjoyed being.
[12104.26 → 12105.30] I don't know if that's really true.
[12105.64 → 12107.12] It's actually just, like, actually not.
[12108.80 → 12111.30] It is broadly pretty true.
[12111.42 → 12114.10] On average, people change careers, like, every six years.
[12114.18 → 12114.58] It's definitely common.
[12115.04 → 12115.20] Yeah.
[12115.42 → 12117.50] Yeah, it's, like, broadly pretty true.
[12117.88 → 12119.14] Very few people do that.
[12119.48 → 12119.78] Sure.
[12120.42 → 12121.28] The exact same.
[12121.36 → 12125.88] Very few companies even exist long enough for someone to spend their entire adult career at it.
[12125.88 → 12131.98] I think it's maybe, like, a helpful thing for him to say to not take it, like, personally on departure because they don't think he necessarily should because...
[12131.98 → 12132.20] Yeah.
[12132.38 → 12133.24] Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada.
[12133.24 → 12134.34] But people do.
[12134.52 → 12140.50] It was a way of saying, yeah, that it's not personal and relationships end and that's okay.
[12140.74 → 12140.88] Yeah.
[12140.96 → 12143.74] And it's time for both of us to move on and that's okay.
[12143.94 → 12144.08] Yeah.
[12144.76 → 12151.72] And so, yeah, it was perspective changing for me because NCI was my first real career job that I felt like.
[12151.76 → 12154.10] Like, I worked as a lifeguard and I worked, like, painting houses.
[12154.10 → 12155.34] But I was doing odd jobs.
[12155.42 → 12156.74] I didn't have a career at that point.
[12157.50 → 12162.50] And so, you know, for me, it was actually probably a more traumatic breakup than the other way around.
[12162.50 → 12168.08] Like, I loved that company in an irrational, like, fanatic kind of way.
[12168.08 → 12168.36] Absolutely.
[12168.36 → 12168.38] Yeah.
[12168.38 → 12172.80] I learned about computers on their community forum, you know?
[12173.28 → 12173.52] Yeah.
[12173.52 → 12185.78] And so, yeah, you know, to have him kind of counter once and then basically just move into negotiations with me on how to move forward, it was like, I just...
[12185.78 → 12192.08] I don't know what I was expecting, but I think part of me wanted them to want me, you know?
[12192.16 → 12193.52] Like, I just...
[12193.52 → 12195.66] Yeah, like I said, I loved that company.
[12196.18 → 12202.48] And I don't think, looking back on it, that that was necessarily at a healthy level.
[12202.80 → 12204.88] I think that you can believe in a company.
[12205.00 → 12206.36] I think you can believe in a mission.
[12206.36 → 12214.80] I think that you can really enjoy the people you work with, whether they're your reports or whether they're your boss or whether they're your peers or whatever else.
[12215.60 → 12223.48] But I think that the way that I had bought into the brand there was not necessarily great for my career.
[12223.88 → 12227.44] I mean, for me, though, the experience of working there was, I think, really different from a lot of people.
[12227.58 → 12229.80] Like, I was a strong negotiator on my own behalf.
[12229.80 → 12234.08] And so, you know, I would hear other people complain about not being paid enough there.
[12234.10 → 12235.74] And I was like, I don't know, I get paid a lot.
[12238.06 → 12242.88] I don't know what to tell you other than, like, generate more value and then go ask for more money.
[12242.88 → 12244.84] Because that's what I did, and it worked out great for me.
[12244.90 → 12248.30] But, like, not everybody takes that approach and not everybody can.
[12248.62 → 12250.46] Also doesn't work out for everyone at every workplace.
[12250.60 → 12251.38] No, 100%.
[12251.38 → 12252.02] Things like that.
[12252.10 → 12255.06] You might try that at your workplace and basically just get shown the door.
[12255.14 → 12255.58] I don't know.
[12256.30 → 12256.48] Right?
[12256.48 → 12261.56] So, you know, my experience was my experience, but it doesn't necessarily translate.
[12263.40 → 12268.54] Anyway, yeah, I still, you know, I still, it's less now.
[12268.64 → 12269.68] You know, having Tara in here helps.
[12270.14 → 12273.92] But there are still some days when I'm like, oh, yeah, that was a that was a cool team.
[12274.08 → 12275.90] You know, it was a cool team.
[12277.46 → 12278.44] Howdy, LLD.
[12278.90 → 12279.68] I didn't like it.
[12280.30 → 12280.52] What?
[12281.14 → 12281.86] Oh, NCI.
[12281.96 → 12283.18] Yeah, they treated you like crap.
[12283.42 → 12283.92] Yeah, yeah.
[12283.92 → 12285.04] Cool team, my butt.
[12285.52 → 12286.06] That's okay.
[12286.06 → 12287.60] You're a cool team now.
[12288.10 → 12288.88] It wasn't Taryn's fault.
[12289.02 → 12289.60] My team's cool.
[12290.16 → 12290.40] Yeah.
[12291.08 → 12292.18] Your team's super cool.
[12293.32 → 12293.88] Howdy, LLD.
[12294.22 → 12299.22] I installed GPS and automation on heavy equipment, dozers, graders, and pavers.
[12299.64 → 12301.68] Any comment about the seams coming apart?
[12301.84 → 12305.40] I really like the jacket, but I can't have it fail when I'm working.
[12306.02 → 12307.10] Oh, which jacket is this?
[12307.50 → 12309.52] I assume it's the...
[12309.52 → 12310.36] Well, it would be in the order, right?
[12310.36 → 12311.64] The working jacket.
[12312.40 → 12313.08] Let me check.
[12313.84 → 12315.04] Oh, there's a drop-down.
[12315.04 → 12316.04] Nope.
[12316.04 → 12316.12] Nope.
[12316.24 → 12318.44] It's a stubby screwdriver and a jerry-rig everything knife.
[12320.10 → 12322.06] I assume you're talking about the workshop jacket.
[12322.48 → 12326.26] If you have any problems with it, I know there are a couple of reviews that mention that issue.
[12326.40 → 12329.04] If you have a problem with it, trust me, bro, we got you.
[12329.22 → 12330.30] Contact customer service.
[12330.72 → 12331.82] They will get you sorted out.
[12331.86 → 12335.68] And if they don't, then you can link them to this WAN show segment, and they will get you sorted out.
[12335.68 → 12341.74] What's next?
[12343.00 → 12344.16] What is an outrageous...
[12344.16 → 12345.78] Are you asking us or are you asking yourself?
[12346.02 → 12346.22] No.
[12346.58 → 12347.04] I don't know.
[12347.20 → 12347.72] Where am I?
[12348.06 → 12351.64] What is an outrageous tech-related conspiracy theory that you've come across?
[12351.64 → 12359.64] An outrageous tech conspiracy theory.
[12360.04 → 12361.48] Where do you even get these?
[12363.18 → 12364.98] People send them in from your website.
[12365.16 → 12366.72] I know where you get them from.
[12367.92 → 12368.82] Oh, man.
[12368.98 → 12371.82] I mean, is it the nanobots and the vaccines?
[12371.82 → 12373.70] Like, that's kind of...
[12373.70 → 12375.42] That's a tech conspiracy theory.
[12375.52 → 12378.46] It's not exactly a new one.
[12379.04 → 12381.40] The chemicals in the water for the frauds.
[12381.40 → 12383.90] Yeah, microchips in the COVID vaccine were, like, a thing.
[12384.16 → 12386.20] But I don't think that's what he's talking about.
[12387.30 → 12388.84] I don't think there's a ton.
[12389.06 → 12390.86] NVIDIA doesn't care about gamers anymore.
[12390.96 → 12391.50] That's outrageous.
[12391.64 → 12392.14] No, I'm just kidding.
[12392.24 → 12392.86] That's, like, totally...
[12392.86 → 12397.68] There's some, like, are your cell phones constantly listening to you because of the suggested ads?
[12397.68 → 12400.86] And the cell phone companies say that those suggested ads are not based off that.
[12400.86 → 12404.06] But some people have experimented and found that it's, like...
[12404.06 → 12405.94] I'm not sure if I believe that.
[12406.18 → 12406.44] Yeah.
[12406.70 → 12409.00] I've seen experiments that lean both directions.
[12409.54 → 12409.98] Hmm.
[12410.50 → 12412.36] But, yeah, I don't know.
[12412.52 → 12413.46] I kind of think they do.
[12414.30 → 12414.80] I don't know.
[12417.58 → 12424.00] In regard to the copyright discussions with Twitch streamers a few weeks ago, how do you guys feel about Media share?
[12424.00 → 12428.54] Okay, I had never heard of Media share until reading this message.
[12428.54 → 12434.64] But I looked it up, and if it's what I think it is, it seems really cool.
[12436.32 → 12440.72] Viewers can send you songs when they tip you.
[12441.10 → 12444.94] And you can choose ones you like, so the media has been paid for.
[12445.04 → 12446.78] Presumably somebody has been compensated.
[12447.04 → 12448.40] And you play them on stream.
[12450.94 → 12453.82] That just seems super cool.
[12453.98 → 12454.40] Seems cool.
[12454.40 → 12466.74] Yeah, it's kind of like if there was a way to mute the background music track of a YouTube video and just play music out of your own library that you like as a background track.
[12466.80 → 12469.46] You're basically, like, contributing your own soundtrack...
[12469.46 → 12470.24] I don't think that would be good.
[12470.24 → 12471.70] ...to the content that you consume.
[12471.80 → 12472.52] No, it wouldn't be.
[12472.58 → 12473.20] I'm just saying.
[12473.36 → 12475.50] It's like the...
[12475.50 → 12476.74] There used to be a feature in games.
[12476.90 → 12479.34] You'd have, like, the jukebox in the game or whatever.
[12479.34 → 12480.54] It could access local files.
[12480.64 → 12481.06] Do you remember that?
[12481.32 → 12482.26] I do remember that.
[12482.38 → 12483.56] That was actually really cool.
[12483.68 → 12488.62] And there are games now where you can buy music, like, especially music games like Beat Safer.
[12489.52 → 12496.10] There are ones that license a certain number of, you know, A-tier titles.
[12496.10 → 12509.84] I think that's really gone out of fashion now that there's been some lapsed licensing, and then it has been complicated for that game, both for streamers and just for the game to continue being sold.
[12510.02 → 12511.80] But that was kind of cool when that happened.
[12513.68 → 12515.38] Looking forward to getting the new merch.
[12515.76 → 12519.32] I am curious if the team has ever thought about creating a board game or not.
[12519.46 → 12521.58] If you could make a board game, what would it be?
[12522.00 → 12522.96] That's the problem.
[12523.66 → 12524.80] That very end bit.
[12524.80 → 12532.24] But a truly creative, engaging board game is, like, a full-time job.
[12532.42 → 12532.72] Oh, yeah.
[12532.78 → 12533.76] It's very hard to make.
[12534.16 → 12535.24] Very hard to make.
[12535.28 → 12535.44] Yeah.
[12535.52 → 12539.20] Like, it's not the kind of thing that I would just be like, her, her, let's make a board game.
[12539.32 → 12540.00] It's, like, basic...
[12540.00 → 12543.98] Let's skin the game of life and just use Luke and Linus as the characters.
[12543.98 → 12549.26] And then the careers are, like, YouTuber and, like, data centre, you know, technician.
[12549.26 → 12553.04] I really like highly strategical, very difficult co-op board games.
[12553.04 → 12553.48] Okay.
[12554.84 → 12555.50] But those exist.
[12555.88 → 12557.26] So, like, it's not like...
[12557.26 → 12557.88] That's a new idea.
[12557.90 → 12561.48] Yeah, I think that's the other big part of it is, have we even...
[12561.48 → 12562.42] It's like...
[12562.42 → 12563.38] Are we contributing anything?
[12563.74 → 12565.60] I've talked about this a fair bit, right?
[12565.68 → 12572.80] Like, if I was going to make a game, it would have been Cross Code or Chained Echoes or, from what I've heard, Sea of Stars.
[12573.06 → 12573.22] Yeah.
[12573.22 → 12579.74] Why would I make that when people are already making that, and I can just play it for $39.99 or whatever?
[12580.44 → 12583.38] Like, compared to how much I would have to invest to make that.
[12583.58 → 12584.74] So, it's the same with board games.
[12585.06 → 12597.48] Like, why am I going to contract someone or hire a team or spend a bunch of time on it when, realistically, I don't have time to play all the amazing games that other people are already creating?
[12597.48 → 12603.92] Yeah, that's one of those where I'm just happy to let somebody else go be creative and cool, and I'm just going to enjoy it.
[12603.92 → 12610.10] I wanted to chime in and ask Luke if he's made any decisions about a new phone yet.
[12610.28 → 12613.74] I have the same phone, and I'm very curious to what you'll pick next.
[12614.22 → 12617.04] Oh, I don't know if I'm going to be able to get away from Pixel.
[12617.36 → 12625.72] So, I'm probably waiting for this, what, October for the launch of, or the announcement at least, I don't know, of the Pixel 8 Pro.
[12627.28 → 12628.86] That's where my head's currently at.
[12630.22 → 12631.68] But, I don't know.
[12631.68 → 12634.72] I've had a lot of frustrations with my last couple of Pixels.
[12635.12 → 12641.36] But, every time I start looking into another phone, I start looking into the OS that happens to come with that other phone.
[12641.92 → 12652.62] And, I'm like, there are certain things that I really like about a very stock Android experience with the Pixel features on top of it.
[12652.86 → 12655.88] And, no, I do not want to get a Pixel Fold.
[12655.88 → 12659.58] So, yeah.
[12659.76 → 12662.50] Probably Pixel, some flavour of Pixel 8.
[12662.76 → 12663.84] I know I said Pro.
[12665.24 → 12669.10] But, I'm yet to see the prices for things and that might influence stuff.
[12669.10 → 12673.88] Jake Dane says, talk to me Tuesday.
[12674.14 → 12678.10] So, I mean, maybe that'll influence my decision.
[12680.22 → 12680.62] Yeah.
[12680.62 → 12682.66] I'm not decided.
[12682.94 → 12685.04] But, I've basically timeline myself.
[12685.68 → 12690.78] Because, my phone was on top of my clothes when I was swimming at Linus' place.
[12690.94 → 12692.12] And, I had a black shirt.
[12692.38 → 12694.22] And, my black phone was on top of my black shirt.
[12694.42 → 12696.46] And, I picked up my shirt to put it on afterward.
[12696.76 → 12698.02] And, it flipped off.
[12698.02 → 12703.46] And, it smacked into, like, the stone steps near your pool.
[12703.64 → 12704.72] And, the screen cracked.
[12705.26 → 12707.04] So, it's, like, it's on its way out.
[12707.18 → 12708.10] It's still usable.
[12708.36 → 12713.48] But, it's, like, it's time to, like, plan for a new phone, you know?
[12713.48 → 12713.72] Got it.
[12715.18 → 12717.60] The screen separated a little bit from the body.
[12717.86 → 12718.84] And, it's cracked slightly.
[12719.96 → 12723.92] So, and it's, like, getting, like, marginally worse all the time.
[12724.62 → 12727.66] So, I think by the time October comes around, it'll be, like, I need a new phone.
[12728.28 → 12729.92] But, I'm pretty sure I can hold out until then.
[12730.92 → 12731.46] But, yeah.
[12731.54 → 12732.96] I'll talk to Jake about it.
[12733.16 → 12733.76] We'll see what he says.
[12735.92 → 12736.98] Howdy from Idaho.
[12737.34 → 12741.16] You have talked a lot about some of the stress and trouble that can come from owning a business.
[12741.16 → 12743.76] But, what's your favourite part of owning a business?
[12743.96 → 12744.22] People.
[12745.94 → 12749.80] People are the worst and hardest part of running a business.
[12750.02 → 12752.92] And, they're also the best and most rewarding part.
[12752.92 → 12754.04] I think I've said that before.
[12754.14 → 12757.92] But, like, the reason why I like my current job is just because I really like my team.
[12758.70 → 12765.14] There isn't, like, anything particular about my actions of what I do in my role that I'm like, I love that.
[12765.46 → 12768.06] I do love seeing the output of all the people on my team.
[12768.14 → 12768.80] That's really cool.
[12769.54 → 12772.70] Because I feel like I have some amount of, like, micro-contribution to all of it.
[12774.04 → 12775.70] But, yeah.
[12775.84 → 12777.76] I really like my team.
[12777.76 → 12782.14] Any thoughts on different coloured stubbies?
[12782.34 → 12783.68] I'd love a yellow one.
[12784.14 → 12788.76] If it sells really well, then we already have most of...
[12789.54 → 12790.68] Not just the moulding.
[12790.72 → 12791.96] I mean, obviously with the moulding.
[12792.10 → 12794.20] But, we already even have parts shot.
[12794.62 → 12794.92] Like, here.
[12795.04 → 12797.40] Luke, can you throw me that yellow screwdriver and a stubby, please?
[12797.40 → 12806.40] So, if you look at this, we are only one moulded part away from making this yellow.
[12806.62 → 12807.98] The end cap is the same.
[12808.60 → 12810.44] The selector ring is the same.
[12810.82 → 12812.38] The accent ring is the same.
[12812.38 → 12824.54] So, all we have to do is take shot yellow selector rings, put this shaft on it, on the ratchet mechanism, and then we just have to shoot some yellow ones of these.
[12825.54 → 12839.58] The problem is that there are minimums in terms of the runs, in terms of ordering the dies for the plastics, in terms of what is just practical for us to keep track of for skew count at our third-party logistics company.
[12839.58 → 12847.16] So, we're going to have to see stubby sell well in black, which is the most popular colour.
[12847.80 → 12858.98] And, after that is proven, then we might look to explore different colourways, whether it's like a Noctua or a retro or yellow or different solid colours or whatever the case may be.
[12859.74 → 12861.16] I could see us doing...
[12861.16 → 12869.36] Now that we have kind of gotten the hang of working with these plastics, and we know that it's reliable and doesn't have to be hot press.
[12869.36 → 12876.30] Like, it is too spec with the cold press, even if it's not quite as gripped on.
[12876.40 → 12878.14] It's very, very close.
[12878.60 → 12885.56] So, knowing that, it would be easier for us to stock parts and then build drivers from them.
[12885.92 → 12889.84] So, it's possible you would see more limited-time drops from us in the future.
[12889.84 → 12893.68] But, that's still very much TBD.
[12896.00 → 12899.34] What's your opinion on the EV industry switching to Tesla chargers?
[12899.54 → 12902.70] Do you think they will further solidify Tesla's position in the market?
[12903.24 → 12904.84] I don't care which one.
[12905.82 → 12907.12] I actually don't care.
[12907.48 → 12911.54] It could be the 4 one, the Tesla one.
[12911.54 → 12912.60] I don't care.
[12913.26 → 12920.14] I'm just glad that the industry has made a freaking decision and the momentum is swinging away in particular.
[12920.40 → 12922.24] It's not like Tesla and everyone else.
[12922.94 → 12926.26] And if we can all do that, then I'm happy.
[12926.26 → 12933.66] Multiple standards for things like charging outlets is terrible.
[12933.66 → 12941.24] We saw this in the phone space where you had to have a different stupid cable and different stupid hookup or adapter for every stupid phone.
[12941.38 → 12942.16] And it sucked.
[12942.62 → 12946.34] And I'm just glad that whoever wins, I have no horse in this race.
[12946.34 → 12949.36] I'm glad it's over.
[12949.74 → 12951.98] Or that it hopefully will be over at some point.
[12952.06 → 12954.70] And I'm saying this as someone with a Taycan.
[12955.14 → 12957.84] With a not Tesla standard charger.
[12958.72 → 12962.46] So, that might be inconvenient for me at some point on public infrastructure.
[12962.46 → 12965.88] But I'm just glad that it's not going to be like this forever.
[12968.02 → 12969.16] Hello, LLD.
[12969.40 → 12972.12] My SO wants the new TV above the fireplace.
[12972.58 → 12973.76] Our current is placed up there.
[12973.76 → 12977.78] What can I say other than it's too high compared to where we sit?
[12978.06 → 12979.54] There are other location options.
[12980.50 → 12984.00] Heat can be bad for the long-term reliability of the TV.
[12985.02 → 12988.50] And also, it's too high for where you sit!
[12991.66 → 12993.16] He's really passionate about this.
[12993.38 → 12994.64] There's a whole Subreddit for this.
[12994.70 → 12995.38] Have you seen it, Linus?
[12995.66 → 12996.62] You know what you should do?
[12997.42 → 13000.16] Take your SO out to the movies.
[13001.02 → 13002.52] Go straight to the front row.
[13002.52 → 13004.18] Sit down with them.
[13004.36 → 13005.14] Go early.
[13005.46 → 13006.82] So, you're in an empty theatre.
[13007.38 → 13008.72] Go straight to the front row.
[13009.12 → 13010.30] Sit down with them in the front row.
[13010.66 → 13011.66] Put your arm around them.
[13012.24 → 13014.22] Grab, grab, kind of grab their arm.
[13014.44 → 13016.04] And then, like, lean back together.
[13016.64 → 13017.84] Be like, isn't this great?
[13018.40 → 13019.58] And when they're like, no.
[13020.32 → 13021.60] You'd be like, okay.
[13021.98 → 13023.90] So, we need to talk about where the TV's mounted.
[13026.34 → 13026.66] There.
[13026.66 → 13028.60] I got you.
[13031.28 → 13032.66] I don't know who curated this.
[13032.72 → 13033.18] I don't care.
[13033.50 → 13035.26] It just says, stubby me daddy.
[13037.54 → 13038.44] I did not.
[13038.60 → 13040.14] That may have been a mis click then.
[13040.92 → 13041.22] Okay.
[13041.32 → 13042.20] Well, it's getting broadcast.
[13042.54 → 13042.76] All right.
[13042.78 → 13043.36] Thank you, Jake.
[13044.32 → 13045.00] Hi, DLL.
[13045.00 → 13049.04] Well, it's 2050, and you've just finished writing your autobiography.
[13049.36 → 13050.04] What is it titled?
[13050.38 → 13052.32] Mine would be, I Couldn't Help Myself.
[13054.46 → 13055.50] Just like Jake D.
[13056.22 → 13057.06] Thanks, Jake D.
[13057.06 → 13066.98] I thought it was a very optimistic title that I just thought would be a really cool title
[13066.98 → 13073.18] for an autobiography for a tech person, but I think wouldn't be appropriate for me that
[13073.18 → 13076.34] I came up with was Be Iconic, because icons.
[13077.52 → 13083.56] Yeah, like, if it was, like, a Steve Jobs-level character, like a Wozniak or something like that.
[13083.56 → 13087.12] But, well, not Wozniak, someone with, like, a strong personal brand.
[13087.52 → 13088.82] So, like a Steve Jobs.
[13089.38 → 13092.18] I could see that being, like, just a really cool title.
[13093.42 → 13096.48] I don't think I have a particularly strong personal brand.
[13096.56 → 13099.28] I think we've seen plenty of evidence for that over the last little while.
[13099.70 → 13102.20] I do my thing, and you guys tolerate it.
[13103.48 → 13104.14] Let's go.
[13104.84 → 13107.02] But, yeah, I think that'd be a super cool name.
[13107.08 → 13111.42] I have no idea what I would call mine.
[13112.12 → 13112.46] I don't know.
[13112.46 → 13114.56] I don't even know if I'll ever do it.
[13114.64 → 13121.88] It would be less of an autobiography and more of just, like, some text diarrhea on a page,
[13121.92 → 13123.34] and if you enjoy it, then cool.
[13123.70 → 13132.06] I don't have a good enough memory, I think, to write something truly autobiographical.
[13133.02 → 13135.42] Then again, I'm not convinced most people who write them do.
[13135.42 → 13143.80] I think you could do a decent amount of recall if you watched old videos and used that old video to try to centre your mind in that time.
[13144.00 → 13145.78] But that would only be professionally.
[13145.78 → 13150.60] I wouldn't remember everything that I thought or went through personally.
[13150.60 → 13158.12] I've gone through—I've looked back at old videos and in watching that video have remembered, like, oh, I'm wearing, like, that shirt.
[13158.74 → 13158.88] Hmm.
[13159.46 → 13160.02] Or I—
[13160.02 → 13161.82] From that concert I went to or—
[13161.82 → 13163.62] Or I did my hair in some weird way.
[13163.62 → 13163.74] Right.
[13163.74 → 13170.52] Or I was standing and, hey, weird, I remember this orange set that used to be in the studio that had, like, a world map and a ladder.
[13170.66 → 13171.84] Like, why the heck did we do that?
[13171.92 → 13178.40] Oh, that reminds me of the meeting that we had with these other people that didn't work at the company and the reasons why we thought that was going to be good.
[13178.40 → 13184.68] And that ties—now I'm remembering those other people and I remember hanging out with them and, like, it kind of branches repeatedly.
[13186.38 → 13186.98] I don't know.
[13187.12 → 13194.66] Like, you might watch an old video of yours and see that you're, like, exhausted and remember that your first one used to cry a lot.
[13195.30 → 13199.22] And it might make you think, like, oh, maybe this was, like, at this time when these things happened.
[13199.32 → 13200.52] And it, like, it just, like, I don't know.
[13200.68 → 13203.06] I find stuff like that can spark memories really easily.
[13203.06 → 13210.66] I feel like what's fascinating to me about something autobiographical is the details, the anecdotes.
[13211.26 → 13213.08] And I feel like that's what I'd be missing a lot of.
[13213.18 → 13213.96] You'd lose a decent amount of that.
[13214.04 → 13217.70] I don't remember almost any of, like, my kids' things.
[13218.04 → 13220.44] Like, I don't remember the first words and stuff like that.
[13220.46 → 13223.34] It is somewhat surprising how much stuff you don't remember.
[13223.74 → 13230.46] I just—I—someone that I know—okay, you guys remember Ivan, right, who used to work here.
[13230.46 → 13241.72] Uh, he has this uncanny memory for just, like, a thing that I said to him nine years ago or whatever.
[13242.02 → 13246.28] And every time he tells me a story, I'm like, that sounds highly plausible.
[13246.92 → 13249.96] I have no recollection that this ever took place.
[13250.08 → 13254.74] And it's not because it's not memorable or funny or cool or something.
[13254.74 → 13262.86] I just—I could tell you the exact model number of some motherboard I had installed 10 years ago,
[13262.86 → 13265.88] but I couldn't tell you, like, a human interaction I had.
[13265.92 → 13268.04] I just—I don't—I don't process it that way.
[13268.08 → 13272.74] I'm kind of—I'm not really a people person, which is, I think, um...
[13272.74 → 13280.42] A double-edged sword for me.
[13285.50 → 13290.68] It's like when—when—when the merch message about, like, what's the best thing about running a company,
[13290.74 → 13293.16] and I said the people, but then I also said it's the worst thing.
[13293.24 → 13294.78] It's like, what's the best thing about life?
[13295.30 → 13295.64] People.
[13296.22 → 13297.20] What's the worst thing?
[13297.70 → 13298.04] People.
[13298.04 → 13300.78] What is worse than people?
[13301.26 → 13302.46] But what's better than people?
[13302.62 → 13304.24] You know, they're—they're amazing.
[13304.38 → 13304.82] They're beautiful.
[13304.96 → 13305.58] They surprise you.
[13305.66 → 13307.64] You know, like, it's—people are complicated.
[13307.84 → 13311.54] The only sketchy thing I find about your memory is sometimes when agreements are made.
[13313.00 → 13314.28] Oh, like about what?
[13314.30 → 13315.50] You just, like, don't remember them.
[13315.86 → 13316.38] Oh, yeah, but—
[13316.38 → 13320.12] Like, I know you don't remember our old, like, computer agreement, but you still honour it.
[13320.26 → 13321.72] Yeah, because it sounds plausible.
[13321.84 → 13322.68] So, like—
[13322.68 → 13323.72] So—
[13323.72 → 13324.26] It's fine.
[13324.26 → 13332.36] My approach is I just always do what I would do, and I just tell the truth.
[13333.46 → 13338.20] And so if I, in good faith, do what I would do, and I'm honest—
[13338.20 → 13342.76] I've never actually had it be a problem, but it is something that's, like, been top of mind often.
[13342.94 → 13346.58] It's like, we'll make some deal, and I'm like, he's not going to remember this.
[13346.78 → 13353.36] So, like, if I—is I did, like, some perfect negotiation or got this through in, like, some crazy way because of some reason, I'm like—
[13353.36 → 13360.32] But there have been times, and you've explained what the negotiation was, and I've been like, sounds plausible.
[13360.46 → 13363.86] He'll sometimes be, like, mad about it, but be like, okay.
[13364.24 → 13365.58] It's like, all right.
[13365.92 → 13372.22] Like, I will admit it has never been a problem, but it is still something that I, like, think about every once in a while.
[13372.28 → 13373.56] Like, he's not going to remember this.
[13373.56 → 13376.56] I don't—
[13376.56 → 13378.38] But it's been fine.
[13378.42 → 13381.52] I don't have the attention to detail to be duplicative.
[13383.46 → 13390.02] That is actually something that—don't ask me how, but I learned from my now wife, then girlfriend.
[13390.02 → 13402.22] I—I do not have the capacity to get away with things because I'll forget, and I will say something inconsistent.
[13403.56 → 13405.06] And it's like, all right.
[13405.48 → 13409.90] It just—it doesn't work for me, so for better or for worse, transparency is the way I go.
[13410.04 → 13412.90] And sometimes, boy, is it ever for worse.
[13412.90 → 13420.16] Last one of the curated I've got for you today.
[13420.66 → 13424.14] Who's Luke's favourite character in Baldur's Gate Triple?
[13425.12 → 13428.56] Oh, um, Carrack, for sure.
[13429.08 → 13438.44] But, uh, it's an interesting question because I actually, like, am not a huge fan of a bunch of them.
[13438.44 → 13443.16] Um, but I think—I think that's a good thing.
[13444.34 → 13445.62] Have you played it?
[13445.82 → 13446.12] Me?
[13446.26 → 13446.52] Yes.
[13446.76 → 13447.02] Yeah.
[13447.16 → 13448.52] I do not like all the characters.
[13448.78 → 13449.02] Yeah.
[13449.28 → 13452.08] And that's great because there are lots of characters.
[13452.28 → 13452.46] Yeah.
[13452.74 → 13457.86] There are a bunch of characters, and the reasons why I don't like some of them, it makes me—I'm like,
[13457.96 → 13463.48] like, I don't like this about this person, but there's an extremely large looming threat,
[13463.94 → 13466.68] and this person is potentially very useful for me.
[13466.98 → 13467.80] I think that makes it better.
[13467.80 → 13468.20] Yeah.
[13468.20 → 13472.04] I don't want you in my party, and I don't like you very much, but we have to—
[13472.04 → 13472.90] But I'll deal with you being here.
[13472.90 → 13473.10] Yeah.
[13473.10 → 13474.80] We have to be friends.
[13474.98 → 13476.44] It makes it feel more real.
[13476.58 → 13478.26] It's very, very good.
[13478.32 → 13482.14] I wouldn't expect every one of those people that came together for the reasons that they came together,
[13482.20 → 13484.24] I'm going to stay vague just because someone hasn't played this game.
[13484.24 → 13485.48] It's just like D&D.
[13485.64 → 13489.12] I wouldn't expect me to like all of them all that much.
[13489.12 → 13490.36] How did a video game do this?
[13490.48 → 13495.46] I found myself—I'm out adventuring, and then I'm like, crap, I need this person that I hate.
[13495.46 → 13499.46] And you kind of have like that sheepish, you know, looking at your feet, walking up.
[13499.46 → 13500.56] So much better than apathy.
[13501.04 → 13501.24] Yeah.
[13501.56 → 13501.70] Yeah.
[13501.78 → 13502.50] Someone in full—
[13502.50 → 13503.32] Oh my God, it is.
[13503.42 → 13503.52] Yeah.
[13503.62 → 13505.42] The worst thing a companion can be is uninteresting.
[13505.60 → 13505.78] Yeah.
[13505.92 → 13507.46] And they are all interesting.
[13507.50 → 13509.12] They're incredibly well written.
[13509.38 → 13509.56] Yeah.
[13509.56 → 13514.68] Yeah, I mean, you walk up to them, and you're like not, ugh, I have to get this guy so I can min-max.
[13514.80 → 13521.18] It's like, oh, I have to talk to this horrible character, and now I have to make them useful.
[13521.50 → 13522.02] Yeah, like there's—
[13522.02 → 13522.74] It's a video game.
[13522.78 → 13524.76] They don't really exist.
[13524.84 → 13525.38] It doesn't matter.
[13525.54 → 13530.42] There's at least one character that I like actively dislike, but is still in my party,
[13530.48 → 13532.50] because I'm like, ugh, you're annoyingly useful.
[13532.50 → 13534.70] I think I know who you're talking about.
[13534.80 → 13540.02] Every time they screw up, like they miss or something like that, I'll just be like, idiot.
[13540.28 → 13540.66] Worst.
[13541.18 → 13542.14] You suck.
[13542.60 → 13543.48] Get wrecked.
[13543.84 → 13545.00] Get out of my party.
[13546.28 → 13547.46] It's my party.
[13548.34 → 13548.84] Sorry.
[13549.40 → 13549.56] Yeah.
[13549.74 → 13550.38] But yeah, yeah.
[13550.98 → 13552.08] Carrack for sure.
[13553.10 → 13554.42] Easy first place.
[13556.58 → 13558.26] After that, it gets a little muddy.
[13558.26 → 13560.38] Yeah, I think I'm talking about Gale, Geofig.
[13560.60 → 13560.76] Yeah.
[13560.76 → 13562.88] Just hit it.
[13563.02 → 13563.80] I hate Gale.
[13564.00 → 13568.30] You have one job, and it's to throw things, and they connect with other things.
[13568.98 → 13569.96] You idiot.
[13571.52 → 13578.74] Yeah, I really like one of the custom characters that I made, but in that play through, I just
[13578.74 → 13580.24] make sure I have Carrack all the time.
[13580.44 → 13584.30] In the game that I have with Wendell, I'm actually just playing Carrack, and that's very
[13584.30 → 13585.02] cool and very fun.
[13585.08 → 13585.56] I like that.
[13586.82 → 13587.58] She's awesome.
[13587.86 → 13590.32] I really disliked Gazelle at the start.
[13591.30 → 13597.54] But then as you get to have more conversations with her, and as you get into deeper conversations
[13597.54 → 13599.10] with her and stuff, she actually grew on me a lot.
[13599.18 → 13599.56] She's pretty cool.
[13599.56 → 13600.44] I had the same experience.
[13600.58 → 13601.90] I don't understand how they did that.
[13602.12 → 13602.82] I think it was...
[13602.82 → 13604.34] Just amazing writing?
[13604.40 → 13605.14] It was perfect.
[13605.14 → 13605.52] Because they're incredible?
[13605.52 → 13608.06] Because you also have to balance the mechanics of it, too.
[13608.18 → 13608.64] Yeah.
[13608.64 → 13612.04] Because you need her in your party to be functional.
[13612.04 → 13616.62] And you have that moment where you start with her, and you're like, oh, I really hate this
[13616.62 → 13618.30] person in my party, but I need them to be functional.
[13618.50 → 13624.12] And then as you get better at the game, you like them more and they become deeper.
[13624.56 → 13625.52] And yeah, I don't know.
[13625.60 → 13626.42] I don't know how...
[13626.42 → 13628.10] It's just...
[13628.10 → 13628.36] Yeah.
[13628.36 → 13629.02] Why don't I try?
[13629.02 → 13631.94] I'm surprisingly attached to the characters in that game.
[13632.08 → 13632.44] It's weird.
[13632.58 → 13634.20] They're very, very well written.
[13634.34 → 13641.12] I told you I had that weird moment where I was looking at my quest table, and I was reading
[13641.12 → 13642.16] like what to do next.
[13642.28 → 13645.78] And it just sort of said like, eh, do the thing.
[13646.78 → 13652.38] And I had this moment of realization where it was kind of, okay, so the quest just tells
[13652.38 → 13656.30] me stuff that I should be doing, not that I have to be doing.
[13657.28 → 13658.66] I can do whatever I want.
[13658.72 → 13660.38] And then it didn't become a video game anymore.
[13660.48 → 13661.54] It was actually fun.
[13661.54 → 13661.90] I think that's...
[13661.90 → 13665.00] I'm going to branch this slightly and talk about Starfield, which is on the table as well.
[13665.22 → 13668.36] I think that's one of the constant problems with Bethesda games.
[13668.40 → 13673.74] And I was kind of talking about this earlier, where people are like, oh, like I have already
[13673.74 → 13678.28] somehow spent a hundred hours in the game and I blasted through the main quest and I blasted
[13678.28 → 13681.48] through all this other stuff because I wanted to be the first one to hit all these achievement
[13681.48 → 13682.38] points and stuff like that.
[13682.42 → 13683.06] And now I'm done.
[13683.40 → 13686.00] And it's like, okay, that's totally valid.
[13686.08 → 13687.28] You can play the game that way if you want.
[13687.92 → 13688.78] I do not think...
[13688.78 → 13689.82] You can do Disneyland like that.
[13690.08 → 13690.38] Yeah.
[13691.66 → 13693.18] I don't think it's the...
[13693.18 → 13697.00] If you really want to extract the most out of it, that's not going to be the best way.
[13697.26 → 13697.54] Just kidding.
[13697.62 → 13698.80] You can't do Disneyland like that.
[13698.86 → 13699.54] They make you wait in line.
[13699.90 → 13700.12] Yeah.
[13700.12 → 13700.98] Even with the fast pass.
[13700.98 → 13709.26] But like Starfield, they build things into it that make it so that you can skip a lot
[13709.26 → 13712.34] of the really valuable parts of the game.
[13713.86 → 13715.80] And they do that because some people are going to want to.
[13715.92 → 13719.18] I know people that played Skyrim that did zero.
[13719.52 → 13722.36] They usually, these types of people, usually didn't play Oblivion in Borrowing.
[13722.60 → 13727.36] But I know people that played Skyrim that did zero of the side quests, zero of the factions,
[13727.64 → 13730.48] just went straight through the main quest, and they were like, that was a cool game.
[13730.48 → 13731.48] And then they moved on.
[13731.54 → 13732.62] And I'm like, wow.
[13733.62 → 13737.28] Like the best parts of that game you did not play.
[13737.76 → 13742.30] Like there's a quest that I don't think most people have run into, but you get drunk with
[13742.30 → 13747.28] Ship GOPATH in a bar, and then you go on a drunken night of shenanigans with Ship GOPATH.
[13747.40 → 13750.78] And then you wake up at the end and have to like deal with all the consequences of the
[13750.78 → 13751.36] things that you did.
[13751.56 → 13753.54] And it's amazing.
[13753.54 → 13756.68] And it has nothing to do with the main quest in the game.
[13756.84 → 13759.78] You have to find that by experiencing the world.
[13760.88 → 13764.76] And I feel like the Baldur's Gate, there's like more of it.
[13764.82 → 13769.40] It like makes you experience it in a cool way, which is great.
[13769.52 → 13774.46] But Baldur's Gate and Starfield, both of them, you gain so much more from those games.
[13774.46 → 13780.58] It's from letting yourself wander, letting yourself explore, and just absorbing in the
[13780.58 → 13781.94] atmosphere and the writing and the game.
[13782.10 → 13783.12] And they're just so much better.
[13783.28 → 13784.48] How much does Bethesda pay you?
[13786.76 → 13793.14] That was one of my, I watched the Making of Borrowing movie, video, whatever you call
[13793.14 → 13793.28] it.
[13793.28 → 13796.54] And I was determined when I was a kid to go work for them when I grew up.
[13797.46 → 13799.36] And then they did certain things.
[13799.48 → 13800.24] And now it's fine.
[13800.44 → 13801.26] I don't need to go work there.
[13801.48 → 13801.58] Okay.
[13801.80 → 13801.96] Yeah.
[13802.10 → 13803.02] This was Borrowing era.
[13803.10 → 13804.22] This was pre-horse armour.
[13805.94 → 13806.76] Thanks, Bethesda.
[13806.88 → 13807.10] Yeah.
[13809.66 → 13810.88] Linus, do you want to go through these?
[13810.94 → 13811.50] Do you want me to read them?
[13811.62 → 13812.82] What's your plan here?
[13813.14 → 13815.30] I mean, yeah, there's only four, so.
[13815.56 → 13816.74] Hey there, LLD.
[13816.98 → 13822.10] The variation of different types of mystery screwdrivers produced will be 5,040.
[13822.10 → 13823.98] That's seven factorial.
[13825.48 → 13825.88] Factorial.
[13826.24 → 13828.66] Do you plan on making more or less than this?
[13828.78 → 13831.26] I'm interested to know how rare these screwdrivers are.
[13834.26 → 13834.66] Okay.
[13834.96 → 13835.76] Hold on a second.
[13836.00 → 13837.70] Is that the math?
[13837.80 → 13839.36] What the heck is factorial?
[13839.64 → 13840.48] It's been a while for me.
[13840.48 → 13841.46] I play too much factorial.
[13842.90 → 13848.70] Factorial, I think, is like the amount of permutations that you can create because you have to use
[13848.70 → 13851.56] one of every single part and there are seven different colors.
[13852.10 → 13857.04] So it's like seven times, six times, five times, four times, three times, two times, one, I believe.
[13857.66 → 13858.38] If I Google that.
[13858.60 → 13860.48] But we could have all the same.
[13861.46 → 13869.40] But even then, if I just do seven times, seven to the power of four, that's still only 2,401 combinations.
[13869.56 → 13870.88] How do you do the math for this?
[13870.88 → 13874.48] I cannot remember statistics.
[13874.84 → 13877.74] I pushed as much as I could from my brain with alcohol.
[13877.98 → 13878.10] Yeah.
[13880.24 → 13881.48] Statistics is evil.
[13882.40 → 13883.78] I don't think it's statistics.
[13884.60 → 13886.52] Can someone do the math for us?
[13886.64 → 13893.36] So there are actually eight colours for one thing because black is also in mystery.
[13893.36 → 13895.84] So there are four components.
[13896.10 → 13902.60] There's the selector ring, the accent ring, the handle, and the top, the end cap.
[13903.24 → 13908.44] And then any one of them can be in any of eight different colours.
[13908.76 → 13913.76] Theoretically, you could get an all solid colour random mystery driver.
[13914.16 → 13915.64] We don't control for anything.
[13915.76 → 13916.74] We just grab whatever.
[13917.64 → 13919.24] So what's the math on that?
[13919.24 → 13921.24] So, yeah, it's just eight to the power of four then.
[13923.52 → 13923.88] Right?
[13925.66 → 13927.46] I think.
[13928.08 → 13928.60] 4096.
[13929.68 → 13931.60] That's what people are saying in the float plane chat.
[13931.68 → 13934.26] And they're more credible than Twitch chat.
[13935.76 → 13936.12] Wait.
[13936.18 → 13936.28] No.
[13936.32 → 13937.60] Someone says 40,000.
[13941.90 → 13942.90] 4096 permutations.
[13943.02 → 13943.56] That's got to be it.
[13943.58 → 13944.64] They're only silver shaft.
[13945.82 → 13946.18] Yeah.
[13946.22 → 13948.44] So there's about 4,000 different combinations.
[13949.24 → 13953.22] We don't plan on making a specific quantity of them.
[13953.30 → 13955.28] It's just based on what we have kicking around.
[13956.54 → 13957.96] We'll see how long they last.
[13958.16 → 13959.42] And it's the same for the coloured ones.
[13959.50 → 13962.28] I saw someone ask, hey, how long are you going to have the green one?
[13962.34 → 13964.94] My company might want to order a bunch of them and equip all of our tech.
[13965.00 → 13965.88] Order them now.
[13966.78 → 13968.72] I don't know if we will restock them.
[13968.78 → 13970.42] I don't know what colours we would restock.
[13970.52 → 13972.18] It all just kind of depends on how they move.
[13972.46 → 13975.72] So if that's something that you want, then you do need to get it.
[13976.72 → 13978.22] How many stubbies have you sold today?
[13978.22 → 13979.48] I actually don't know.
[13979.76 → 13985.28] I can tell you, though, that a few during the show, there's been hundreds of merch messages.
[13986.06 → 13989.88] And item number one most popular is stubby screwdriver.
[13990.32 → 13992.32] I might have a number for you if you would like me to say it.
[13992.94 → 13993.32] Yeah.
[13993.36 → 13994.42] It's not accurate, though.
[13994.58 → 13994.82] Okay.
[13994.82 → 13997.14] Because it's 411.
[13997.52 → 13999.02] But the dashboard doesn't cap.
[13999.20 → 13999.34] Oh.
[13999.80 → 14002.62] No, the tally that's been running all night.
[14003.48 → 14003.84] Oh.
[14004.90 → 14007.58] Is it like somewhere in the like 3,000, 4,000 range?
[14007.72 → 14008.24] Something like that?
[14010.40 → 14011.10] Oh, wow.
[14011.24 → 14011.50] Okay.
[14011.66 → 14011.84] Yeah.
[14011.84 → 14013.86] Apparently, it's just shy of 5,000 so far today.
[14013.98 → 14014.52] That's a wow.
[14014.58 → 14016.24] That's a really solid launch.
[14017.26 → 14019.06] Hey, thanks, guys, for your support.
[14019.66 → 14021.00] But also, you're welcome.
[14021.38 → 14022.32] It's a solid product.
[14022.52 → 14026.68] You know, I'm really confident in this one just because it's all proven stuff other than
[14026.68 → 14028.72] we did a new plastic mould for the handle.
[14028.80 → 14028.98] Right.
[14028.98 → 14037.38] So, yeah, I'm just really proud of the team, I think, is probably the easiest thing for
[14037.38 → 14039.42] me to say with 100% confidence.
[14039.86 → 14040.98] You know, I'm not going to...
[14041.80 → 14046.10] I think that you and I have engaged in a fair transaction.
[14046.48 → 14047.54] It's a perfect product.
[14047.62 → 14048.02] You're welcome.
[14048.30 → 14049.78] And also, thank you for your business.
[14050.14 → 14055.00] And the team has done an amazing job of bringing this thing to market, getting it ready in time
[14055.00 → 14057.04] for LTX, and then following up with the launch here.
[14057.04 → 14059.04] Yeah.
[14059.78 → 14065.80] Luke, Dan, and Linus, hello from a Canuck brother, adding to my quest of food questions.
[14066.46 → 14067.98] What is your dream breakfast?
[14068.22 → 14072.40] Mine is waffles with strawberry yogurt and syrup with Costco breakfast sausages.
[14073.66 → 14074.74] Dream breakfast?
[14075.00 → 14075.72] I mean, ugh.
[14075.98 → 14080.10] I've never really been a breakfast person because I have, like, a very adverse reaction to eggs.
[14083.68 → 14086.54] I guess I'll say dream breakfast is something that I don't...
[14086.54 → 14087.48] I'm not...
[14087.48 → 14088.54] They have...
[14088.54 → 14089.80] The calories are fake.
[14090.16 → 14090.70] They don't matter.
[14091.20 → 14095.60] Then it's going to be Belgian waffles with a bunch of whipped cream and a bunch of fruit.
[14095.74 → 14096.62] Have you been to Rosebery Farm?
[14097.08 → 14097.30] Yeah.
[14097.62 → 14097.90] Okay.
[14098.24 → 14099.36] So, that basically...
[14099.36 → 14099.80] I haven't gotten it, though.
[14100.12 → 14100.46] What?
[14102.04 → 14103.02] That's their thing?
[14103.04 → 14105.16] The one time I went for that reason...
[14105.16 → 14106.10] What the fuck?
[14106.18 → 14110.10] The one time I went for that reason, they only had raspberry.
[14110.56 → 14110.80] Oh.
[14110.80 → 14111.34] All right.
[14111.44 → 14112.56] And I'm not that into raspberry.
[14112.82 → 14113.22] All right.
[14113.44 → 14114.40] It's like the worst berry.
[14114.74 → 14115.70] And it's also not a berry.
[14118.74 → 14123.40] Every once in a while, we find something that we disagree about very strongly.
[14124.02 → 14125.90] This is one of those once in a while.
[14126.00 → 14127.74] You don't like raspberries?
[14127.80 → 14128.38] It's not a berry.
[14128.94 → 14129.56] Who cares?
[14130.02 → 14130.98] It's delicious.
[14131.40 → 14132.60] I'm not that into raspberries.
[14132.76 → 14133.36] I don't like the bitter.
[14133.54 → 14134.72] Rhode Island isn't an island.
[14134.86 → 14134.98] What?
[14135.06 → 14135.86] You hate it now?
[14135.86 → 14136.26] Yeah.
[14140.26 → 14140.58] Yeah.
[14140.66 → 14140.78] No.
[14140.82 → 14141.38] I'm not that into it.
[14141.46 → 14142.20] I like blackberries.
[14142.80 → 14143.44] I like blueberries.
[14143.76 → 14143.90] What?
[14143.96 → 14145.32] And a blackberry is a berry now?
[14148.34 → 14149.28] I don't think it is.
[14149.30 → 14151.42] Your logic is extremely inconsistent, sir.
[14151.46 → 14152.40] And I'm finding it upsetting.
[14153.48 → 14153.66] I know.
[14153.72 → 14154.12] I'm just not...
[14154.12 → 14154.96] I'm not really into the bitter.
[14155.70 → 14155.92] Yeah.
[14156.48 → 14156.98] I can...
[14156.98 → 14157.78] It's the sour.
[14157.90 → 14158.50] It's not bitter.
[14159.18 → 14160.78] Oh, maybe you have crappy raspberries, then.
[14160.90 → 14161.14] Maybe.
[14161.28 → 14161.70] There are lots of different rites.
[14161.70 → 14165.78] This is something that I thought about recently, because Dan's mom,
[14165.86 → 14168.34] the person who grew the cucumbers, also grows raspberries.
[14168.54 → 14170.64] And I was mentioning how I don't like raspberries, and I was like,
[14171.14 → 14174.54] but maybe I would like these, because it's very possible I've just had bad ones.
[14174.54 → 14177.20] Everything that you're describing you don't like about raspberries
[14177.20 → 14180.66] sounds like not normal raspberries.
[14180.72 → 14181.64] Don't forget raspberries...
[14181.64 → 14183.26] Yeah, so maybe I've just had junk raspberries.
[14183.50 → 14184.76] Raspberries don't keep well.
[14185.00 → 14185.72] Oh, they do not.
[14185.78 → 14187.04] So this is maybe part of the problem, too.
[14187.16 → 14189.16] I'm not saying there's no chance.
[14189.28 → 14191.30] Okay, if you get them at the grocery store, they suck.
[14191.30 → 14191.90] My experience with...
[14191.90 → 14193.32] Okay, so that's the only ones I've ever had.
[14194.08 → 14195.10] You just need to go, like...
[14195.10 → 14197.08] And get to use some raspberries.
[14197.08 → 14197.86] At cross berry farm.
[14198.54 → 14199.78] And eat them on a waffle!
[14200.90 → 14202.16] That's what they do!
[14202.74 → 14203.54] I was also...
[14203.54 → 14206.94] This was also very recently, so I was in my, like, trying to lose weight phase.
[14207.06 → 14207.50] Fair enough.
[14207.62 → 14207.78] Yeah.
[14210.10 → 14212.68] I'll rediscover good raspberries at some point.
[14213.50 → 14215.02] Pretty sure you've just eaten mouldy raspberries.
[14215.04 → 14217.62] I don't know if they were mouldy, but they're definitely grocery store raspberries.
[14217.64 → 14219.14] They sure weren't good, I can tell you that much.
[14219.22 → 14219.38] Yeah.
[14219.38 → 14220.10] All right.
[14220.10 → 14222.38] I answered a bunch of these already.
[14223.24 → 14229.46] Hey, LLD, what components should be the focus of a music production PC that utilizes a lot of virtual instruments?
[14230.84 → 14231.60] You answer this.
[14231.60 → 14232.40] I have to answer this?
[14232.44 → 14233.10] Yeah, why would we answer this?
[14233.10 → 14233.82] Yeah, why would we answer this?
[14233.82 → 14234.70] I already answered it!
[14234.74 → 14235.56] I already replied to it!
[14235.60 → 14236.98] Okay, let me think.
[14237.54 → 14238.78] CPU, lots of RAM.
[14239.04 → 14239.38] Good IL.
[14239.38 → 14242.50] Really, really, perfect single core performance from the CPU.
[14242.84 → 14248.66] You also need a secondary PCI card for USB Thunderbolt or Maddie or Dante.
[14248.98 → 14256.52] If you use the internal motherboard, the graphics drivers can interact with the USB thing, and you get clicks and pops and increased latency.
[14257.58 → 14259.54] NVIDIA drivers are pretty bad for latency.
[14260.40 → 14262.80] There's one or two USB chips that are perfect.
[14262.80 → 14266.00] That's about it.
[14267.22 → 14267.88] I don't know.
[14269.32 → 14269.76] Budget.
[14270.24 → 14270.60] Goodbye.
[14272.14 → 14274.44] Oh, wait, I have to continue talking because there's another merch message.
[14274.76 → 14276.48] Hey, DLL, something I have...
[14276.48 → 14277.44] This has never happened to me before.
[14277.82 → 14279.88] Hey, DLL, something I have thought about a lot.
[14279.88 → 14285.28] Why do you think companies focus on pure electric cars instead of improving hybrids?
[14286.20 → 14291.50] Oh, because plug-in hybrids were really hard to communicate.
[14291.50 → 14305.46] I've talked about this on the show before, but the Volt was an awesome car that people who get it and love it, and people who don't have it leave terrible reviews for it.
[14305.52 → 14307.46] I feel like plug-in hybrids got Wii U'd.
[14308.06 → 14308.32] Yeah.
[14308.96 → 14318.58] Plug-in hybrids, to me, before I experienced your Volt, my understanding of plug-in hybrids were those really crappy ones early on, where it was basically a huge car battery.
[14318.58 → 14321.86] And you couldn't actually just drive electric.
[14322.16 → 14323.04] Yeah, so just a hybrid.
[14323.36 → 14323.54] Yeah.
[14324.08 → 14324.26] Yeah.
[14324.38 → 14325.58] But plug-in hybrids...
[14326.18 → 14329.68] Were basically like EVs with a gasoline range extender.
[14329.72 → 14330.58] Which is amazing.
[14330.58 → 14331.80] Best of both worlds.
[14331.80 → 14340.66] Now, even a lot of the, you know, like the Prius Prime, for example, I think is a stupid plug-in hybrid because it doesn't have enough range, at least for me.
[14340.82 → 14349.80] If you drive a shorter distance, it could work great for you, but for me, I couldn't commute to and from work on battery, which is what I want so that I'm not burning fuel all the time.
[14349.98 → 14350.14] Yeah.
[14350.14 → 14360.50] But what's good about it is, like the Volt, you could just gas it up and drive as far as you want and gas it up again and drive as far as you want, and it would behave like a really efficient hybrid that whole time.
[14361.34 → 14366.00] So driving on the actual hybrid mode where it uses both is like insanely efficient.
[14366.14 → 14369.82] I think dealerships didn't properly understand it, didn't get proper training.
[14369.82 → 14377.54] I think that the manufacturers were not really that incentivized because there wasn't a ton of profit in it because they had complex drive chains.
[14378.10 → 14378.94] Excuse me.
[14380.86 → 14381.38] Trains?
[14381.38 → 14381.54] Yeah.
[14381.96 → 14382.28] Trains.
[14382.40 → 14382.64] Trains.
[14382.78 → 14383.42] Drive chains.
[14384.64 → 14385.96] Bicycles on the mind, apparently.
[14386.46 → 14387.82] Complex drive trains.
[14388.28 → 14390.38] Trains in some cases.
[14391.04 → 14393.42] I think that there wasn't a lot of...
[14393.42 → 14397.84] I think there wasn't a lot of understanding about them from a consumer standpoint.
[14397.84 → 14404.44] The petrol heads, the ambassadors of the motor world, were super not into them.
[14404.48 → 14405.40] They don't sound cool.
[14405.48 → 14406.64] They don't go fast.
[14408.18 → 14418.56] And I think it was hard to communicate the savings when everyone wants the efficiency of a vehicle just boiled down to like an EPA-rated something,
[14418.78 → 14423.60] when actually, with these cars, it really depends on how you drive them.
[14423.60 → 14429.78] If you never touch the gas tank, you are going to get amazing efficiency out of it.
[14429.78 → 14436.88] And if you're one of those people who just drove it on the gasoline engine the whole time you had it, then you're not.
[14437.04 → 14438.06] It's still going to be okay.
[14438.26 → 14440.46] It's still going to be about like a hybrid, so that's good.
[14440.78 → 14442.94] But it's not going to be amazing.
[14444.30 → 14447.24] Yeah, it's sad to me because I thought they were super cool.
[14447.66 → 14450.36] Just like I think it's super cool to say, hey, thanks for tuning in.
[14450.66 → 14451.62] We'll see you again next time.
[14451.74 → 14454.04] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[14454.04 → 14455.12] Bye!
[14484.04 → 14487.84] Bye!
[14487.84 → 14488.94] Um...
[14488.94 → 14490.42] Yes, and yesterday.
[14492.82 → 14493.56] Okay, uh...
[14493.56 → 14494.58] I'll play this game.
[14494.58 → 14495.34] I'll play this game.
[14495.34 → 14495.94] I'll play this game.
[14495.94 → 14496.90] I'll play this game.
[14496.90 → 14497.10] Thank you, Al.
[14497.10 → 14509.36] P- poor,
[14509.36 → 14509.48] I'll play this game.
[14511.36 → 14513.80] I'll play that game.
