[0.00 → 5.64] What is up everybody? Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN Show!
[5.90 → 10.86] We have way too many topics this week. This is a serious problem.
[11.04 → 11.50] A lot happened.
[11.64 → 18.38] Switch fodder Gary Bowser has been released from prison with a life-destroying fine.
[20.20 → 25.54] Meanwhile, game devs have been cracking down on hardware-level cheats.
[25.62 → 28.28] This is going to be a fascinating conversation. What else we got today?
[28.28 → 33.86] Seagate was hit with a $300 million fine for violating an export ban.
[34.06 → 34.38] Yikes.
[34.52 → 37.98] And where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
[38.14 → 43.24] Gameplay trailer accused of being filmed IRL. It was that convincing.
[45.86 → 46.46] Okay.
[46.64 → 47.60] Everyone was fooled.
[47.98 → 48.40] That-
[48.40 → 49.22] Everyone.
[49.88 → 56.32] That's the title tie-in today. Everyone? Really, Luke? Everyone?
[56.32 → 60.50] Let's just roll the intro. We'll talk about that later.
[60.50 → 85.64] The show is brought to you today by Messi, Zoho 1, and Squarespace.
[85.64 → 93.46] Obviously, we're going to have to jump right into our headline topic, which is the gameplay trailer that fooled the world.
[94.36 → 96.00] Are we showing it, or are we just going to talk about it?
[96.00 → 100.10] Yeah, we might as well show it. I mean, what's IGN going to do? Copyright strike us?
[101.06 → 103.64] Oh, we could have just brought it up from the creators. Okay, that's fine.
[103.64 → 109.12] Yeah, I mean, that's fine. You guys are going to want to go check it out on your own screens because you're watching this through our compression.
[109.44 → 109.64] Yes.
[109.72 → 114.78] Now, there are some things that are very, very convincing about this.
[114.78 → 115.04] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[115.04 → 121.88] In fact, I think the approach of the building is probably the most hyperrealistic looking part of this gameplay trailer.
[121.88 → 133.06] The fact that this gets blown out as the camera's apparent automatic exposure adjusts to the darker environment here on the protagonist's left.
[133.88 → 135.88] But this flashlight...
[137.68 → 139.52] Come on!
[140.68 → 141.72] Come on!
[142.18 → 144.58] It looks like a video game flashlight.
[145.22 → 146.96] And, okay, to be clear...
[146.96 → 147.34] I thought it was pretty good.
[147.42 → 148.28] To be clear...
[148.28 → 150.06] Okay, I'll bring it back up. I'll bring it back up in a second.
[150.06 → 154.80] I am not hating on the people that were initially bamboozled here.
[155.50 → 156.52] Okay, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[156.54 → 159.24] But when the game developer came out and said,
[159.68 → 161.14] No, this is in-engine.
[161.42 → 164.24] This is rendered on just a gaming computer.
[164.56 → 167.26] This is just the game being played.
[167.46 → 168.44] And people are like,
[169.30 → 172.16] No, I don't believe you.
[173.38 → 176.46] And they actually can't tell at that point.
[176.46 → 177.46] I mean...
[177.46 → 179.42] Really?
[180.06 → 181.40] Really?
[181.62 → 182.56] Okay, so we'll go back.
[182.72 → 183.22] Let's go back.
[183.30 → 184.00] Let's go back to the game.
[184.06 → 185.86] So I want to talk about this flashlight.
[186.74 → 186.98] Okay?
[187.08 → 188.82] And the way that it illuminates things.
[189.18 → 192.34] That is not how a flashlight works.
[193.98 → 198.60] The light bouncing is not true to life at all.
[198.60 → 201.82] I think it's pretty good.
[201.86 → 203.04] I think it's better than most games.
[203.94 → 204.30] No.
[204.44 → 204.76] Okay.
[204.84 → 205.54] No question.
[206.14 → 206.88] No question.
[207.20 → 207.70] No question.
[208.08 → 209.20] But even after...
[209.20 → 212.30] So what happened is this gameplay trailer was released.
[212.64 → 214.30] People basically went,
[214.66 → 216.72] It looks like you're cheating.
[216.96 → 219.58] It looks like you just recorded body cam footage.
[219.76 → 221.66] And you're trying to pass it off as a game trailer.
[221.72 → 223.20] You're trying to pull some kind of scam.
[223.48 → 223.76] Right?
[223.76 → 225.36] And he comes out, and he goes,
[225.60 → 226.42] Actually, no.
[226.80 → 230.78] And he posts a no-clip version of it.
[230.96 → 232.32] Where he's flying around.
[232.44 → 236.70] You can technically fake a lot of what happened in that no-clip version.
[238.70 → 240.98] You can technically fake anything.
[241.82 → 243.46] I agree with Linus, actually.
[243.68 → 244.20] But I'm just...
[244.20 → 246.54] I'm throwing some counterpoints to try to make it more interesting.
[246.74 → 250.00] You can technically fake a lot of what happened in the no-clip.
[250.00 → 255.50] Sir, you can fake a battle with a sea dragon in Shang-Chi.
[255.98 → 260.46] That doesn't mean that what he did is not perfectly valid evidence.
[260.86 → 261.48] I completely...
[261.48 → 261.98] Okay.
[262.16 → 262.50] Hold on.
[262.56 → 263.78] I actually have a bit of a counterpoint for that.
[263.78 → 264.50] Let's bring up the no-clip.
[264.62 → 265.42] Let's bring up the no-clip.
[265.46 → 265.66] Okay.
[265.72 → 265.94] Okay.
[267.04 → 267.36] Record.
[268.00 → 268.24] Record.
[269.40 → 270.60] Actually, I have it on my screen.
[270.70 → 270.94] Full screen.
[270.94 → 271.32] You've got it?
[271.32 → 271.60] Okay.
[271.98 → 273.02] I'm coming over to you.
[273.36 → 273.76] Go for it.
[273.80 → 274.86] So I'm going to go back to the beginning.
[275.02 → 275.22] Okay.
[275.50 → 275.94] This is it.
[275.94 → 282.74] So here he is in the environment showing the way the auto-exposure, quote-unquote, handles things.
[283.36 → 284.94] And then he goes...
[285.46 → 289.00] Also, that is not the angle at which arms come out of an actual body.
[289.44 → 290.76] So, no.
[293.76 → 297.74] Here we go.
[299.18 → 301.26] Those reflections in the water look great.
[301.36 → 302.26] Jump cut slightly.
[302.26 → 304.20] And I want to make it really clear.
[304.36 → 315.14] I am not saying that this is an ugly looking game or that this hyperrealism appearance that it has is not hyperrealistic.
[315.62 → 316.90] It's hyperrealistic.
[317.28 → 318.26] It's amazing.
[318.74 → 319.46] It just looped.
[319.54 → 320.24] This is back to the beginning.
[320.40 → 320.50] Okay.
[320.58 → 321.00] So, okay.
[321.24 → 322.30] So, some of my arguments.
[322.72 → 322.90] There are...
[322.90 → 323.16] Sure.
[323.16 → 335.18] There are easily things that this developer could have done to make the no clip proof significantly more obvious as actual real proof.
[335.26 → 336.16] He went through walls.
[336.48 → 339.00] That's not actually that hard to think at all.
[340.68 → 351.04] I think that they did it this much so that there's just the slightest bit of doubt in some people because that is getting us to talk about it.
[351.20 → 352.62] I think this was tactical.
[353.16 → 354.30] That's fair enough.
[354.52 → 355.50] Which is fair enough.
[356.26 → 357.10] However...
[357.10 → 361.82] I think the developer is very smart and did this entirely on purpose.
[362.18 → 367.36] Personally, I did not need the no clip because there are some fairly obvious tells.
[367.48 → 369.26] And I mean, maybe part of this...
[369.26 → 374.20] And the people after the no clip basically saying, I still don't believe you.
[374.30 → 375.20] La, la, la, la.
[375.28 → 376.46] I don't know.
[376.52 → 377.92] I don't know what to tell you guys because...
[377.92 → 380.42] And maybe part of this is that I do this for a living.
[380.54 → 388.60] Like, I pixel peep and evaluate the graphical fidelity of things and look at new rendering features and their implementations.
[388.60 → 390.16] I actually do this for a living.
[390.74 → 392.44] But to me...
[392.44 → 393.62] There are some things that stand out.
[393.68 → 395.62] If you sent this to me and said...
[395.62 → 395.88] Okay.
[396.10 → 397.10] What is this?
[397.52 → 399.34] What is this bokeh effect here?
[399.34 → 402.06] Obvious post-processing.
[402.42 → 404.08] That is not real bokeh.
[404.52 → 411.88] I think another thing that really, really benefits all the footage is because it's trying to recreate this effect of like...
[411.88 → 412.64] Shaky cam.
[412.78 → 413.98] Some Jacky body cam.
[414.06 → 414.34] Yes.
[414.34 → 418.28] It does a bunch of stuff like this where it actually...
[418.28 → 425.10] It's intentionally lowering its quality while having really, really high quality assets.
[425.92 → 428.60] So that makes it so much more believable.
[428.76 → 435.74] These actually really rough, kind of bad screen effects that they have going on make it so much more believable.
[436.20 → 438.18] It's a very interesting effect.
[438.58 → 441.02] The way that they handle the motion.
[441.28 → 441.46] Yeah.
[441.46 → 441.78] Okay.
[441.86 → 444.82] The way that they handle the perspective and the camera shaking.
[445.84 → 446.40] So cool.
[446.54 → 447.56] I also think...
[447.56 → 447.94] So cool.
[448.04 → 451.02] That this is, you know, like piloted by expert.
[451.64 → 456.62] So I have some theories that just like in Markov, there's independent head control.
[457.12 → 461.54] So in Markov, if you hold down your middle mouse button, it doesn't matter where your firearm is located.
[461.76 → 463.12] You can look around like this with your head.
[464.40 → 464.80] Right.
[464.80 → 466.56] And I think that's going on in here.
[467.24 → 471.30] And the developer, whoever has just run through the scenario a bunch of times,
[471.46 → 476.74] so they did it at really realism effective times, if you know what I mean.
[476.94 → 477.14] Sure.
[477.26 → 488.10] So when there's already that thing where you can kind of move where you're aiming and the perspective of the head of the person that you're controlling doesn't immediately move.
[488.24 → 490.26] So you have the firearm slightly disconnected.
[490.26 → 496.04] And that's something most people wouldn't be used to and wouldn't imagine that a game would be capable of doing.
[496.04 → 497.44] Like Counter-Strike Valorant, something like that.
[497.52 → 498.20] They don't do that.
[498.20 → 498.36] They don't do that.
[498.38 → 498.90] It's fixed.
[499.16 → 501.04] There are games that do this already.
[501.24 → 501.38] Yeah.
[501.42 → 503.44] This one's implementation is perfect.
[503.76 → 504.68] Let's have a look at that.
[504.68 → 508.16] I think it's doubling up with some independent head control.
[508.28 → 508.48] Yep.
[508.96 → 513.34] And a player who is extremely adept at making this feel real.
[513.44 → 513.76] Sure.
[513.88 → 515.76] Like I think this is almost acted, I would say.
[515.96 → 516.38] You know what I mean?
[516.44 → 516.54] Sure.
[516.66 → 517.22] Yeah, I could see that.
[517.22 → 517.86] I mean, it's a trailer.
[518.16 → 518.32] Yeah.
[518.36 → 522.58] They went through trying to make it feel like it was real, which is what they should have done for the trailer.
[523.32 → 524.88] But I think it's both.
[524.88 → 527.50] Again, we've got messy post-processing here.
[530.96 → 531.66] The smoke.
[531.66 → 531.70] The smoke.
[532.16 → 532.54] Yeah.
[533.14 → 535.62] The smoke is absolutely video game smoke.
[535.84 → 536.28] The smoke is wild.
[536.52 → 536.64] Yeah.
[536.86 → 539.46] The angle of the arms is also wrong again.
[540.38 → 543.86] And it's not, like, to be clear, it's not bad smoke for a video game.
[543.96 → 546.80] It's just also, it's video game smoke.
[546.94 → 547.16] Yeah.
[550.00 → 556.64] The way that this darkness that he's standing in here is so dark, that's not correct.
[556.84 → 557.30] Like black.
[557.30 → 561.04] With daylight coming in here, this would be blown out.
[561.04 → 563.16] But this would have a lot more light.
[563.50 → 571.04] And again, okay, I'm, like, I was actually kind of arguing with Riley about this before the show.
[571.44 → 578.56] Because I said something along the lines of, where's my chat with Riley?
[579.72 → 580.22] I was like...
[580.22 → 584.32] Also, really great, while you're looking that up, really great area scans of where this is.
[584.32 → 586.86] I was like, it's obvious it's not real.
[586.94 → 588.62] What if these people never seen a game before?
[588.72 → 589.86] Must be console gamers.
[590.32 → 592.24] Modded Crisis can look almost this good.
[592.50 → 595.46] And he's like, I was kind of trolling.
[595.74 → 598.28] Because I knew that he thought it.
[598.36 → 598.42] Yeah.
[598.54 → 600.46] I was obviously messing with him a little bit.
[600.50 → 601.48] But he's like, bro.
[601.48 → 606.90] Me and apparently 75 of the internet were like, whoa, upon seeing it.
[607.70 → 609.02] It's definitely a whoa.
[609.74 → 610.88] It's pretty crazy.
[611.14 → 617.22] I was talking to Jaden about this because he's really into game engines and understands a lot of their limitations and stuff like that.
[617.48 → 620.94] We've had conversations in the past about different game engines.
[621.02 → 623.26] I'll, like, comment about how some game looks good.
[623.28 → 624.14] And he'll be like, no.
[624.40 → 624.76] Yeah.
[624.76 → 628.20] It doesn't because of these reasons that I'm like, oh, okay, that's actually a pretty good point.
[628.20 → 637.52] But another thing that it only occurred to me now that my eye is trained for is not just the video game graphics, pixel peeping, but cameras.
[638.00 → 644.72] I spend so much of my life working on one side or another of a camera.
[645.18 → 651.84] And so when I see something like this, this is such a perfect example where I go, nah, dog.
[651.84 → 661.98] Dog, this ceiling, this rooftop, this roof up here absolutely has strong reflections on it because of the reflectiveness of this water.
[662.42 → 663.36] This is not correct.
[664.64 → 668.94] It's very obvious to me because I know what a webcam should look like.
[670.36 → 672.86] But, see, you can see it's doing a much better job of it here.
[673.32 → 678.04] After our protagonist takes even just a few steps forward, that wouldn't happen in the real world.
[678.04 → 681.32] It would be more gradual, that kick animation, though.
[681.38 → 681.92] Come on.
[682.54 → 684.62] But the door movement and stuff, very good.
[684.64 → 685.52] The door movement's pretty good.
[685.62 → 689.52] Like, I don't want to trash on certain aspects of it too much.
[689.52 → 691.60] That's very fake, very fake, very fake.
[691.80 → 692.20] What is?
[692.34 → 692.90] This flashlight.
[693.08 → 693.44] Look at it.
[693.56 → 694.08] Come on.
[694.98 → 696.98] You can get extremely focused flashlights.
[697.00 → 702.20] Yeah, you can get extremely focused flashlights, but they wouldn't have a beautifully defined circle around them like this.
[702.38 → 702.68] Yeah.
[703.18 → 703.82] No, dog.
[704.38 → 704.80] No.
[704.80 → 705.06] No.
[707.20 → 710.16] This looks great.
[710.38 → 710.90] Oh, yeah.
[710.94 → 717.26] One of the things that I thought of in the no clip demo to make it, like, more believable, he should have done object interaction.
[717.68 → 721.30] He should have, like, picked an object and, like, moved it around, replaced it somewhere.
[721.48 → 721.82] Right.
[722.00 → 724.60] But it's area scans, so I don't even think he can.
[724.94 → 725.16] Right.
[725.22 → 726.62] Do you want to explain what area scans are?
[726.68 → 731.04] Because I think a lot of people are probably looking at this going, this is blowing my mind.
[731.04 → 731.74] Level of details is insane.
[731.74 → 734.22] How can anything have this kind of graphical fidelity?
[734.40 → 738.48] Because there was another demo that popped up recently of, like, a village or something.
[738.60 → 739.64] I'm going to try and find it.
[739.76 → 739.92] Okay.
[739.98 → 745.20] But it was also photorealistic and apparently done by a single developer.
[745.74 → 748.14] Don't quote me on any of this, though, because I'm a little bit...
[748.14 → 756.96] Again, when I was talking to Jaden about this before the show, he looked up, and I think, if I remember correctly, I don't want to misquote him.
[757.22 → 760.88] I think he found that they, like, worked with some company to get scans.
[760.88 → 767.88] And he was saying that, like, the area that they scanned isn't necessarily...
[768.90 → 770.22] Yeah, Quite Megascan.
[770.32 → 770.80] There we go.
[771.24 → 772.40] I think that's what he said, too.
[773.98 → 778.66] So it's not necessarily that the area that they scanned is in this exact configuration.
[778.66 → 780.46] But they could have made it...
[780.46 → 782.16] They could have, like, you know, cut it up.
[782.80 → 787.64] So, oh, through this door might have been, like, some, I don't know, medical room or something.
[787.74 → 788.88] But they're like, oh, we don't want that.
[788.92 → 790.20] We want that to be another part of the warehouse.
[790.46 → 792.16] So they just, like, move it there.
[792.24 → 793.16] And they can do that.
[793.16 → 794.28] But these are...
[794.28 → 798.14] This is, like, an existing area that they could have chopped up or just not.
[799.76 → 805.74] So when you notice things, like, something that stood out to me on my, like, first pass was the green...
[805.74 → 807.44] When I first looked at it.
[807.50 → 808.50] Should I be on your screen?
[808.50 → 809.78] There's these green...
[809.78 → 810.44] Oh, yeah.
[810.46 → 810.84] Here we go.
[811.26 → 812.28] These green banners.
[813.02 → 813.18] Yeah.
[813.30 → 813.88] Or whatever these are.
[814.06 → 816.30] I was like, oh, they all have unique graffiti.
[817.92 → 820.22] Like, why would they, like, bother to do that?
[820.74 → 820.98] Right.
[820.98 → 821.88] And then that's...
[821.88 → 825.74] I almost immediately was like, is this some type of scan?
[825.84 → 829.50] And then, yeah, Jaden, without me even prompting, like, immediately looked it up.
[829.58 → 830.04] And yeah, it was.
[830.48 → 831.48] That's another thing, too.
[831.54 → 834.60] Because it's a scan, three-dimensional things.
[834.60 → 836.36] Like, for example, the textures.
[836.74 → 839.88] We see some dumpsters and stuff inside later.
[840.68 → 845.10] Those textures do not look three-dimensional enough as you move around them.
[845.38 → 846.24] They're quite flat.
[846.38 → 847.12] Look at this banner.
[847.50 → 847.74] Yeah.
[847.88 → 848.36] Really quick.
[848.36 → 851.48] Like, this just looks like it's a different colour when you get close.
[851.58 → 851.68] Yeah.
[852.00 → 853.08] It looks like it's shading.
[853.30 → 853.74] It's flat.
[853.86 → 857.00] But as you go by, it's flat, right?
[857.12 → 857.30] Yeah.
[857.82 → 863.18] If this scan technology improved to the point where you could scan in three dimensions,
[864.02 → 867.86] like, more finely, obviously, this is a three-dimensional scan.
[867.86 → 871.88] And it might have just been that, like, they didn't spend enough time on that one, like,
[871.94 → 874.14] sheet of plastic or whatever that thing is on the fence.
[874.34 → 877.82] And, like, maybe if they got more detail scans of that individual thing, they could have
[877.82 → 878.80] actually gotten that depth.
[880.56 → 886.50] But it's really impressive what they're able to do with this, like, photogrammetry scanning
[886.50 → 887.18] stuff.
[887.18 → 892.90] There's also, there's people that have been scanning buildings using this and then just
[892.90 → 896.82] bringing in the textured, like, depth maps.
[896.94 → 897.12] Yeah.
[897.68 → 903.80] And then texturing them with mid-journey textures, which is really, fascinating.
[904.02 → 908.68] One way or another, even if it's not the kind of thing that, you know, I can look at and
[908.68 → 912.52] go, wow, this is definitely body cam footage, because it's definitely not.
[912.52 → 915.10] It's not, people are talking about the flashlight still.
[915.46 → 917.86] It's not just that it's a perfect circle.
[918.70 → 920.10] That's pretty normal.
[920.44 → 925.00] What it is, is the way that the flashlight is static.
[925.54 → 925.80] Okay?
[925.94 → 927.60] So the edges are kind of blurred here.
[927.64 → 929.44] If we go back to it again for a second here.
[929.76 → 929.92] Yeah.
[930.38 → 932.78] Atari in full-plane chat just said, you can 3D scan.
[932.88 → 933.02] Yeah.
[933.08 → 936.24] That's why I said, like, they might just not have taken as much time on that, like,
[936.34 → 939.68] one sheet of whatever, because it's probably not that big.
[939.82 → 940.90] So come look at this.
[940.90 → 943.20] Here's something that they could do to improve this a little bit.
[943.46 → 946.64] You see how it has this kind of halo around it?
[947.34 → 954.28] A real person holding a real flashlight would have jittered, rotationally and side to side and
[954.28 → 954.86] up and down.
[955.04 → 956.78] It has no rotational jitter.
[957.90 → 964.06] So it's just a static, it's like, it's a map applied to the light output that is coming
[964.06 → 965.60] from this gun.
[965.68 → 967.96] It's always the same kind of haze.
[967.96 → 971.02] Um, that's what makes it look unnatural.
[971.18 → 973.02] That's what makes it look incorrect.
[973.02 → 974.26] Not true to the real world.
[974.78 → 978.62] Um, some people are still in the chat saying, I'm actually still questioning this.
[978.82 → 983.64] Freddie Wong has done videos where he shoots actual video made to look like a video game.
[983.72 → 984.04] Guys.
[984.88 → 987.12] No, this is an engine.
[987.68 → 989.22] It's just getting that cool.
[989.34 → 990.02] Check this out.
[990.08 → 992.62] This is the one I was talking about from Tai chi Kobayashi.
[992.62 → 1000.06] Um, it's not quite as, uh, because of the way the camera moves, it's, it's more video
[1000.06 → 1000.36] game.
[1000.36 → 1002.02] Like it's, it's not as convincing.
[1002.02 → 1006.74] You can see kind of some fisheye to the lens, but, and yet the lens is not quite where your
[1006.74 → 1007.26] eyes would be.
[1007.32 → 1011.66] It doesn't have that vignetting that gives it that really convincing, like goggle effect.
[1011.66 → 1015.20] I think that's part of why the other ones so convincing too, is it really feels like you're
[1015.20 → 1016.04] looking through goggles.
[1016.26 → 1016.32] Yeah.
[1016.32 → 1023.44] Um, but in terms of the scans, in terms of the photo realism of this, guys, games are
[1023.44 → 1023.82] coming.
[1024.12 → 1025.46] They're going to look like this.
[1026.08 → 1027.56] This is freaking cool.
[1027.84 → 1028.62] It doesn't matter.
[1028.74 → 1028.76] Yeah.
[1028.76 → 1030.82] That waterfall doesn't, doesn't seem legit.
[1031.00 → 1031.20] Yeah.
[1031.50 → 1032.88] But it, it's that house.
[1033.32 → 1037.70] Oh, for a, for a second there when there was none of the outside that looked like it
[1037.70 → 1039.52] could have been a Google Maps screenshot.
[1039.88 → 1040.12] Yeah.
[1040.32 → 1041.62] It looks like a picture.
[1041.80 → 1042.10] Wow.
[1042.10 → 1047.46] And look how different and like independently waving, like all this greenery and stuff.
[1047.46 → 1048.90] It's the greenery on this one.
[1048.94 → 1049.88] I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[1049.90 → 1051.88] Because I want you guys, I want you guys to go watch it.
[1051.88 → 1056.10] It's just UE5 environment art, Cliff wood village.
[1056.32 → 1057.58] Go check this out guys.
[1057.64 → 1058.02] That's wild.
[1058.10 → 1058.76] I've never seen that.
[1058.88 → 1061.06] It's, oh, it's beautiful.
[1061.38 → 1061.68] It's art.
[1062.00 → 1062.12] Yeah.
[1062.36 → 1063.54] Um, yeah, that's okay.
[1063.56 → 1071.20] So that's one of my like biggest, I guess, uh, red flag concerns about this thing is how
[1071.20 → 1073.54] many people it convinced and how realistic it is.
[1073.60 → 1075.10] Like it's very, very impressive.
[1075.90 → 1076.18] Yes.
[1076.22 → 1078.28] There's some tells, but it's extremely impressive.
[1078.82 → 1083.36] With a little bit of AI and a little bit of a little bit more polished, a little bit
[1083.36 → 1084.90] AI give it three or four years.
[1085.28 → 1088.62] The, the old, when I was first growing up, I thought you were, I thought you were getting
[1088.62 → 1091.56] into how this could be like dangerous, like faking things or what?
[1091.62 → 1092.54] Oh, that is where you're going.
[1092.62 → 1092.92] Oh, good.
[1093.02 → 1094.88] When we were first growing up, it was Pixar.
[1095.00 → 1095.48] It didn't happen.
[1095.48 → 1095.72] Right.
[1096.46 → 1099.44] And then that pretty quickly was like video, or it didn't happen.
[1099.56 → 1100.50] Video or it didn't happen.
[1100.50 → 1102.60] What's truth now?
[1102.68 → 1103.74] That's like gone.
[1104.24 → 1107.82] Jaden was saying, you know, you combine a bunch of these things, you combine as far
[1107.82 → 1111.08] as this has gotten in regard to realism with the movement and stuff like that.
[1111.16 → 1111.32] Yeah.
[1111.40 → 1114.88] You combine that with lower the resolution a little bit, and it'd be tougher for me to
[1114.88 → 1115.10] tell.
[1115.48 → 1117.70] Like part of how I can tell is how sharp it is.
[1117.80 → 1118.04] Yeah.
[1118.32 → 1120.04] Although yeah, that's something I didn't even mention.
[1120.08 → 1123.88] It looks too good for like body camera, webcam or like GoPro footage.
[1124.16 → 1125.76] It's too sharp, too high quality.
[1125.76 → 1130.08] A lot of those things are very, they're, they're buying for like the entire country's police
[1130.08 → 1130.36] force.
[1130.36 → 1130.58] Right.
[1130.58 → 1133.02] So like they're, they're, they're usually going to be pretty cheap.
[1133.12 → 1133.74] They don't look that good.
[1133.96 → 1138.52] Um, but yeah, you combine deep fakes in terms of how people look.
[1138.58 → 1143.62] You combine the, the like voice, uh, emulation stuff that people are doing.
[1143.98 → 1148.64] Uh, you combine a lot of the stuff that we see in here and even slightly improve all those
[1148.64 → 1149.50] things by a little bit.
[1149.50 → 1154.92] And the average person is not going to be able to tell like at all.
[1155.54 → 1155.94] Yeah.
[1155.94 → 1156.60] This is wild.
[1156.92 → 1161.64] And as long, as long as you can have a legitimate debate where there's a significant amount of
[1161.64 → 1167.84] people on both sides, then what is like representable truth other than eyewitness?
[1168.02 → 1168.50] This is great.
[1168.60 → 1171.38] Bixby in the float plane chat says live stream where it didn't happen.
[1171.38 → 1179.30] I mean, have you seen some of the unmasking that have happened with like, um, uh, the
[1179.38 → 1183.54] the, the biggest ones that I'm aware of were some live streamers in China where they were
[1183.54 → 1188.50] pretty much wearing the appearance of a completely different looking person.
[1188.58 → 1188.94] What?
[1189.06 → 1189.94] No, I've never heard of this.
[1190.28 → 1190.68] Really?
[1190.78 → 1192.68] I thought we've talked about this on the show before.
[1192.92 → 1193.70] I don't think so.
[1195.16 → 1196.58] Ah, okay.
[1196.62 → 1196.92] Hold on.
[1196.94 → 1198.10] Let me see if I can find it.
[1198.10 → 1201.08] Uh, beauty YouTuber exposed during live stream.
[1201.08 → 1201.26] Yeah.
[1201.28 → 1201.74] Here we go.
[1202.66 → 1203.60] Uh, here we go.
[1203.66 → 1203.76] Yeah.
[1203.84 → 1204.22] This is it.
[1205.04 → 1205.86] This is her.
[1207.26 → 1208.08] This is her.
[1210.44 → 1210.84] Huh.
[1211.02 → 1214.36] So it's like real time, uh, appearance modification.
[1214.36 → 1218.08] You see those like filter things on, on TikTok and stuff.
[1218.12 → 1218.78] Yeah, exactly.
[1219.02 → 1219.92] They don't exist elsewhere.
[1220.08 → 1220.24] Yep.
[1220.42 → 1220.90] A hundred percent.
[1221.06 → 1225.44] And when you're running them on more powerful hardware, you can do more outlandish things
[1225.44 → 1225.78] with it.
[1226.04 → 1227.76] So live stream where it didn't happen.
[1228.02 → 1228.42] Nope.
[1228.80 → 1229.20] Yeah.
[1229.20 → 1230.54] We have nothing left.
[1230.54 → 1234.24] The second it's video, or it didn't happen, live stream where it didn't happen is already
[1234.24 → 1235.24] basically out the window.
[1235.72 → 1238.06] Well, it's harder to apply those effects live.
[1238.22 → 1240.18] I mean, you look at, again, back to Shang-Chi.
[1240.30 → 1240.80] But if you can do it.
[1241.76 → 1242.04] Okay.
[1242.70 → 1244.18] The dragons are real.
[1245.24 → 1245.88] Not live.
[1245.96 → 1246.48] Not real time.
[1247.02 → 1250.86] If you can do it, not in real time, being able to do it in real time is coming.
[1251.62 → 1252.42] That's what I'm saying.
[1252.42 → 1256.80] Like, eventually a computer will get fast enough, and it can just do it.
[1256.86 → 1257.22] It's fine.
[1257.60 → 1257.82] Yep.
[1258.36 → 1259.70] It'll be, it'll be right around the corner.
[1260.02 → 1262.20] Companies like NVIDIA will make sure that happens.
[1262.20 → 1269.26] I do want to jump into the LTT merch stuff for this week a little bit sooner than we normally
[1269.26 → 1273.92] would just because I don't want to see people ordering this and not taking advantage of the
[1273.92 → 1274.20] promo.
[1275.32 → 1281.26] It's very unusual for us to do this, but we actually have a launch promo coming with the
[1281.26 → 1283.64] item that we are announcing this week.
[1284.38 → 1284.90] Meet.
[1286.56 → 1287.12] Here.
[1287.98 → 1288.32] Thanks.
[1288.90 → 1290.86] Meet the Wag hoodie.
[1292.96 → 1296.42] It's a little tiny WAN hoodie for your dog.
[1296.72 → 1297.26] Yeah.
[1298.80 → 1299.88] It's so cute.
[1300.28 → 1306.18] It has all the same features and quality that you've come to expect from the regular human
[1306.18 → 1312.40] sized WAN hoodie, but now in a convenient size for small to medium-sized dogs.
[1312.82 → 1315.08] It also has some dog specific features.
[1315.38 → 1320.80] So the hood can be buttoned back to keep it out of the way of your furry companion.
[1321.14 → 1326.18] There is a leash hole that passes through the hoodie into the inside.
[1327.24 → 1329.20] So you can run your leash through it.
[1329.72 → 1332.98] It does have a kangaroo pocket here.
[1334.04 → 1335.52] Does it actually go all the way through?
[1335.52 → 1336.28] Hilarious.
[1336.44 → 1337.84] It does go all the way through.
[1337.96 → 1341.32] We actually went way over the top in terms of the quality of the construction.
[1341.60 → 1346.38] Like it's even got the same built in orange accents on the sleeves.
[1347.42 → 1352.86] But anyway, the point is that on the back, it's got this little kangaroo pouch and a working
[1352.86 → 1361.24] PKK, of course, waterproof zipper that you can put, you know, I don't know, extra like
[1361.24 → 1367.08] emergency doggy bags or condoms for all the action you're going to be getting because your
[1367.08 → 1369.60] dog is so cute, and you strike up so many conversations.
[1370.76 → 1372.32] I can't believe your dog has a hoodie.
[1373.06 → 1374.14] I know, right?
[1374.14 → 1377.00] Small to medium-sized dogs.
[1377.20 → 1378.02] If you go on the side.
[1378.06 → 1378.66] Oh, right, right.
[1378.82 → 1380.12] So I was going to mention the promo.
[1380.58 → 1384.36] Normally, we don't do launch promos, but we do have one today.
[1384.66 → 1392.86] If you buy the WAN hoodie and a WAG hoodie, it's $24.99 for the WAG hoodie.
[1392.86 → 1397.34] But if you buy them together, you will get a $10 discount that's applied automatically
[1397.34 → 1398.72] at the checkout.
[1398.92 → 1399.88] You can match your dog.
[1399.90 → 1401.42] So you can match your dog.
[1401.48 → 1404.22] It's decently stretchy, and it's not super resistant.
[1404.40 → 1406.56] So if your dog was like a little bit big, it would be okay.
[1407.00 → 1410.76] Yeah, but do please follow the size guide very carefully.
[1411.28 → 1417.58] We are hoping to expand our available sizes to accommodate larger dogs, but not for now.
[1418.54 → 1419.68] Not for now.
[1419.80 → 1420.36] So cute.
[1420.36 → 1426.14] I don't know what you're talking about, Pretzel Parkour.
[1427.26 → 1428.16] I don't know.
[1428.34 → 1430.48] Apparently, we no longer accept a perfectly working card.
[1430.70 → 1431.06] Contact customer support.
[1431.16 → 1433.86] Yeah, all you can do is contact support, and we'll try and get you sorted out.
[1435.24 → 1439.92] I mean, better for us to not take your money than to take your money and not deliver it, I guess.
[1440.04 → 1440.30] Yeah.
[1440.30 → 1441.16] We're doing okay.
[1441.30 → 1442.20] Just needs contact customer support.
[1442.22 → 1443.14] Yeah, you got to contact support.
[1443.44 → 1443.94] Look at this.
[1444.16 → 1444.52] Ah!
[1445.44 → 1446.06] Hey, Ripley.
[1447.98 → 1449.96] I can't believe Jake put this thing on his cat.
[1450.36 → 1452.16] Wait, what?
[1453.30 → 1453.70] Yep.
[1457.02 → 1457.82] Oh, man.
[1458.06 → 1458.24] That was funny.
[1458.24 → 1465.18] It is so fun that we have so many of our staffers come in to, you know, model the merch and bring in their dogs.
[1465.28 → 1466.00] What a fun shoot.
[1466.32 → 1466.56] Hey!
[1467.86 → 1469.00] There's Dennis and Charlie.
[1470.00 → 1470.72] The boy, Charlie.
[1471.74 → 1472.06] Ah!
[1472.06 → 1472.26] Ah!
[1473.46 → 1476.38] That was a weird spot for my cursor with it on his eye like that.
[1476.48 → 1479.26] I love how his cat doesn't even seem to like mine.
[1479.40 → 1479.68] Oh, no.
[1479.76 → 1480.26] Arlo's chill.
[1480.70 → 1481.00] Whatever.
[1481.48 → 1482.30] Oh, sweetest sweater.
[1482.48 → 1483.76] Arlo gives zero FS.
[1484.02 → 1486.74] We have a couple of other things to announce this week.
[1486.74 → 1489.46] We have two new limited edition sticker packs.
[1489.82 → 1492.02] Computer cats and gaming dogs.
[1492.20 → 1493.60] So these are going to be in the bonus bin.
[1493.70 → 1497.78] I mean, you can just buy them if you really want to.
[1497.90 → 1500.42] But they are bonus bin items, I think.
[1500.82 → 1502.08] I'm pretty sure they're bonus bin items.
[1503.08 → 1506.42] So these are actual dogs of Linus Media Group.
[1507.10 → 1509.24] I don't know all of their names.
[1509.44 → 1510.40] Maybe that's...
[1510.40 → 1511.22] It is a bonus bin item.
[1511.42 → 1512.00] It's a bonus bin.
[1512.04 → 1512.42] Okay, good.
[1512.66 → 1513.84] Maybe that's something we specify.
[1514.30 → 1516.60] But I do know this cat is Dash.
[1516.96 → 1517.58] That's my cat.
[1518.52 → 1519.48] I'm pretty sure...
[1519.48 → 1520.40] Oh, this has got to be Arlo.
[1521.82 → 1524.64] I'm not sure all the other cats necessarily.
[1524.86 → 1527.78] But, yep, they're all actual cats of actual people who work here.
[1528.10 → 1531.54] And I'm sure Sarah knows who they belong to.
[1531.54 → 1535.98] And then the final thing is we have just launched our mystery plaid.
[1536.26 → 1539.44] So the latest addition to our popular mystery series.
[1539.74 → 1545.38] If you want to get a deal, and you don't necessarily care what colour of plaid flannel you get,
[1545.64 → 1549.06] you can pick up the mystery plaid flannel for $39.99 US.
[1549.46 → 1552.96] It's the same great quality, just in a mystery colour.
[1553.56 → 1555.74] So if you check out the...
[1555.74 → 1556.76] Yep, there it is.
[1557.22 → 1558.08] It could be this.
[1558.50 → 1559.72] It could be a this.
[1559.72 → 1561.04] It could be a this.
[1561.04 → 1562.80] Or it could be this.
[1563.52 → 1564.18] Very cool.
[1564.48 → 1564.76] All right.
[1564.76 → 1565.68] Someone asked,
[1565.84 → 1571.92] is there a behind-the-scenes video of the photo shoot of the WAG hoodie?
[1572.32 → 1572.94] I don't know.
[1573.22 → 1575.46] And that could be a kind of fun idea,
[1575.64 → 1577.00] is behind-the-scenes of some photo shoots.
[1577.16 → 1577.60] We have.
[1577.64 → 1578.20] We have done one.
[1578.42 → 1579.98] Yeah, we did one with the 3D Down jacket.
[1579.98 → 1583.52] But I'm not sure if they had thought to do a behind-the-scenes of this one.
[1583.96 → 1590.70] That would be a great question for our community coordinator, who is not off probation yet,
[1590.86 → 1594.90] but I bet if you posted it on the Subreddit or something, if you're like,
[1594.96 → 1598.68] hey, attention, LMG community coordinator, don't post a bunch of other random stuff,
[1598.74 → 1600.66] because the only one I'm going to flag for him is this one.
[1601.24 → 1603.50] But if you're like, hey, is there a behind-the-scenes coming?
[1603.58 → 1605.34] I'm sure he'd be happy to figure that out for you.
[1605.52 → 1607.20] There's going to be like a million of those threads now.
[1607.90 → 1609.60] I mean, I'll just tell him to ignore them.
[1609.84 → 1610.40] So it'll be fine.
[1610.74 → 1612.84] I don't want to create unnecessary work for people, guys.
[1612.94 → 1613.60] There's no point.
[1613.86 → 1613.96] Yeah.
[1614.22 → 1614.72] All right.
[1614.72 → 1616.94] Why don't we jump into our next big topic?
[1617.66 → 1622.54] Switch fodder released from prison with life-destroying fine.
[1623.38 → 1630.02] This is a tough one, because on the one hand, one of our other topics is going to be,
[1630.60 → 1634.10] hey, thank goodness for a large fine for a change,
[1634.10 → 1641.48] because if you don't have the fine reflect the magnitude of the criminal action,
[1641.48 → 1646.46] then companies will just treat fines as cost of doing business and shrug them off.
[1647.88 → 1652.06] But in this case, we are talking about an individual.
[1652.70 → 1653.54] It's a bit different when it's an individual.
[1653.64 → 1662.90] But an individual who engaged in commercial activities as part of their criminal endeavours.
[1663.92 → 1665.44] Let's get through this.
[1665.92 → 1669.20] Canadian, fellow Canadian, Gary Bowser.
[1669.54 → 1669.90] Amazing.
[1669.90 → 1673.90] Has been granted early release from his 40-month prison sentence
[1673.90 → 1677.80] on grounds of good behaviour and undisclosed health problems.
[1678.42 → 1682.46] The background here is that Bowser pled guilty to trafficking mod chips
[1682.46 → 1686.86] that allowed pirated games to be played on Switch consoles in late 2021
[1686.86 → 1690.24] as part of his involvement in Team Executor.
[1690.72 → 1692.26] Bowser was not a fodder himself.
[1692.44 → 1695.00] His role was primarily PR and marketing.
[1695.00 → 1699.00] While Bowser's plea deal spared him substantial jail time,
[1699.00 → 1703.62] he's still facing a fine of $14.5 million,
[1703.62 → 1711.10] of which he has only paid $175 through menial jobs at the prison library and kitchen.
[1711.10 → 1714.66] Should Bowser get another job upon his return to Canada,
[1715.10 → 1720.88] his pay will be garnished 25-30% to service the fine that he owes Nintendo.
[1721.56 → 1726.02] Bowser is 52 years old and has physical limitations due to his ill health.
[1726.56 → 1729.16] Assuming a typical life expectancy of 81 years,
[1729.60 → 1733.06] Bowser would have to earn $500,000 a year,
[1733.06 → 1734.92] not including living expenses,
[1734.92 → 1737.08] in order to pay off his debt before he dies.
[1741.34 → 1744.94] This really does seem like cruel and unusual punishment.
[1745.18 → 1745.36] Yes.
[1746.06 → 1748.78] We, we, the, the thing you brought up with like,
[1748.82 → 1751.22] oh, we have another topic about a company getting slammed with a fine.
[1751.72 → 1752.90] Usually we don't.
[1753.56 → 1756.54] It is interesting that today we do happen to have one.
[1756.64 → 1756.84] Yeah.
[1756.84 → 1758.90] But it is actually very uncommon.
[1759.04 → 1761.20] It's something that we very often talk about
[1761.20 → 1764.46] is how these companies getting slap on the wrist fines
[1764.46 → 1769.16] for like 5 to 10% or less of the profit that they made doing a certain venture
[1769.16 → 1772.72] just does nothing because that's just a cost of doing business for them.
[1772.96 → 1773.04] Yeah.
[1774.62 → 1779.16] The scale of this is quite egregious though.
[1779.40 → 1781.72] The fact that there's no,
[1781.72 → 1785.82] there's no timeframe during which his wages are garnished.
[1785.82 → 1788.88] I mean, and look, you know what?
[1788.96 → 1791.84] I mean, I was about to draw parallels to child support where I say like,
[1791.94 → 1794.28] look, we're not talking about another innocent life
[1794.28 → 1796.84] that, you know, Gary Bowser walked out on
[1796.84 → 1798.92] and is refusing to support or something like that.
[1799.10 → 1801.40] Even with f***ING child support,
[1801.74 → 1803.46] when they become an adult,
[1803.64 → 1805.48] you're no longer obligated to pay it.
[1806.20 → 1806.30] Right.
[1807.18 → 1809.96] How does this make any sense?
[1811.20 → 1812.04] Yeah, it's so intense.
[1812.04 → 1815.14] I mean, and coming back to a punishment
[1815.14 → 1818.72] that is proportionate to the means, right?
[1818.82 → 1825.30] To the capabilities of the person being punished
[1825.30 → 1827.28] or the entity being punished.
[1828.04 → 1829.26] Like on the one hand,
[1829.32 → 1830.04] I'm looking at it going,
[1830.16 → 1830.60] yeah, okay.
[1830.78 → 1832.48] So garnishing wages,
[1832.66 → 1835.90] I guess is better than taking 100% all the time,
[1836.00 → 1837.22] you know, forcing him to,
[1837.32 → 1839.58] what, put up a cup on the street
[1839.58 → 1841.92] and then literally take that and give it to Nintendo.
[1842.08 → 1843.56] Obviously, I guess it's better than that.
[1844.02 → 1845.40] But it is clear,
[1845.40 → 1846.44] it is obvious
[1846.44 → 1850.80] that this 14 and a half million dollar sentence
[1850.80 → 1855.44] is completely unattainable.
[1855.68 → 1858.22] And he's also just probably screwed.
[1858.36 → 1861.68] Like if we can have a probably unfortunate conversation here,
[1862.14 → 1863.78] cost of living right now is insane.
[1864.16 → 1864.50] Well, yeah.
[1864.50 → 1867.50] Like a huge percentage of people I know,
[1867.58 → 1870.36] if their wages just got deleted by 25 to 30%,
[1870.36 → 1871.02] they're just screwed.
[1871.36 → 1872.44] Yeah, they're out.
[1872.58 → 1872.86] They're done.
[1872.98 → 1873.56] Like out of the house,
[1873.68 → 1874.22] on the street,
[1874.44 → 1875.16] immediately screwed.
[1875.68 → 1876.32] So like...
[1876.32 → 1878.20] And he's stuck with that for life.
[1878.72 → 1879.16] And as far,
[1879.28 → 1880.18] there's nothing in,
[1880.24 → 1882.90] there's nothing in our talking points about this,
[1883.14 → 1885.06] but I would have to make the assumption
[1885.06 → 1888.10] that Nintendo would have thought of him
[1888.10 → 1889.62] just declaring bankruptcy
[1889.62 → 1890.74] and walking away from it.
[1890.82 → 1893.28] Hence the wage garnishing.
[1893.28 → 1897.46] So there's just no way out.
[1897.64 → 1897.84] No.
[1898.44 → 1899.40] I mean, honestly,
[1899.90 → 1900.94] if like...
[1900.94 → 1902.42] The chance that he's going to start making...
[1902.42 → 1903.54] Would he be better off in prison?
[1905.00 → 1905.90] Very possibly,
[1906.02 → 1906.68] because I honestly,
[1906.78 → 1907.24] I don't...
[1907.24 → 1908.92] Like a minimum security prison.
[1909.10 → 1911.60] If he doesn't have job prospects lined up
[1911.60 → 1914.14] that are very, very lucrative,
[1914.68 → 1916.26] then he's going to be on the street anyway.
[1916.48 → 1917.60] Like I...
[1917.60 → 1923.26] I'm...
[1923.26 → 1924.26] I'm...
[1924.26 → 1927.28] I've been trying to think of like solutions.
[1928.00 → 1928.24] Yeah.
[1928.46 → 1931.36] What would you think if it was like he...
[1931.36 → 1933.38] It doesn't start getting garnished
[1933.38 → 1937.28] until he makes a minimum of some amount of money per year?
[1937.36 → 1937.64] Okay.
[1937.72 → 1938.40] I mean, I can...
[1938.40 → 1939.98] Because he'd have to be able to earn a liable wage
[1939.98 → 1941.08] before the garnishing starts.
[1941.08 → 1941.22] Yeah.
[1941.22 → 1943.64] We can play kind of point counterpoint here a little bit.
[1943.70 → 1944.80] Like I'll play devil's advocate.
[1945.30 → 1946.04] Just to be clear,
[1946.10 → 1946.74] that's what I'm doing.
[1946.90 → 1947.98] But my defence to that,
[1948.04 → 1949.00] if I'm Nintendo, right,
[1949.48 → 1949.88] is,
[1950.14 → 1951.50] well, then he's just going to carefully
[1951.50 → 1953.60] not declare any income above that amount
[1953.60 → 1954.32] and we get nothing.
[1954.40 → 1954.52] Yeah.
[1954.56 → 1957.52] So the country can't just take another homeless person though.
[1957.58 → 1958.22] Like...
[1958.22 → 1960.02] You're like basic...
[1960.02 → 1960.54] I know.
[1960.54 → 1961.62] If that rule...
[1961.62 → 1962.78] I know you're playing devil's advocate.
[1962.96 → 1963.28] I know.
[1963.70 → 1965.22] But that's what they would say.
[1965.30 → 1965.92] I get that.
[1966.08 → 1968.36] But as the country of like Canada,
[1969.02 → 1970.12] I would just be like,
[1970.24 → 1970.60] no.
[1971.08 → 1972.92] Because it's going to cost the country
[1972.92 → 1974.34] a ton of money in this situation.
[1976.46 → 1976.86] Sure.
[1979.18 → 1980.52] But if I'm Nintendo,
[1980.74 → 1981.36] I'm kind of going,
[1981.50 → 1983.24] well, that sure as heck isn't my problem.
[1983.66 → 1985.54] And my copyright was infringed.
[1986.26 → 1986.66] Yeah.
[1986.78 → 1988.12] So welcome to the limitations.
[1988.38 → 1988.74] I don't know.
[1988.96 → 1989.20] Yeah.
[1989.20 → 1992.88] I don't think a company should be able to just like
[1992.88 → 1994.22] decide that someone's going to be homeless
[1994.22 → 1995.08] for the rest of their lives.
[1995.86 → 1996.70] That's crazy to me.
[1996.98 → 1997.84] Like unacceptable.
[1998.82 → 1999.30] And...
[1999.30 → 1999.72] Absolutely ridiculous.
[1999.88 → 2002.22] And what's really mind-blowing to me
[2002.22 → 2003.20] is how...
[2003.94 → 2004.22] I mean,
[2004.26 → 2006.00] I guess that's sort of part of the cruel
[2006.00 → 2007.34] and unusual punishment, right?
[2007.38 → 2009.28] Is the unusualness of it.
[2012.16 → 2012.64] Countless,
[2013.48 → 2016.08] countless people have been involved in,
[2016.56 → 2016.74] you know,
[2016.74 → 2018.00] whether we want to talk about,
[2018.14 → 2018.92] what were they called?
[2018.92 → 2021.18] R4 chips or whatever for the DS,
[2021.34 → 2021.88] like in...
[2021.88 → 2022.36] It was a court,
[2022.42 → 2022.82] not a company.
[2022.92 → 2023.66] So I've heard...
[2023.66 → 2023.88] Sorry.
[2024.02 → 2024.24] Sorry.
[2024.52 → 2025.04] I just...
[2025.04 → 2026.16] I see a bunch of people saying
[2026.16 → 2026.64] it was a court,
[2026.70 → 2027.90] not a company.
[2028.10 → 2028.84] That is like,
[2029.42 → 2030.96] in a lot of ways,
[2031.10 → 2031.48] true.
[2032.16 → 2032.46] Yeah.
[2032.80 → 2034.86] Because the company can ask for whatever.
[2035.48 → 2035.70] Yes.
[2035.70 → 2036.66] And lawyers
[2036.66 → 2038.42] and all this whole structure
[2038.42 → 2039.28] will encourage you
[2039.28 → 2040.94] to ask more than...
[2040.94 → 2042.66] It's the whole bargaining thing,
[2042.70 → 2042.90] right?
[2043.20 → 2044.28] I want to sell this thing.
[2044.34 → 2045.16] I'm going to ask for like...
[2045.16 → 2045.56] Start high.
[2045.56 → 2046.90] Settle less high.
[2047.06 → 2047.22] Yeah.
[2047.50 → 2049.02] So they're expecting...
[2049.02 → 2050.94] It's going to be a very difficult conversation
[2050.94 → 2051.66] to convince them
[2051.66 → 2053.10] to ask for what they actually want
[2053.10 → 2054.80] because nothing is structured
[2054.80 → 2055.50] to work that way.
[2055.54 → 2055.78] Also,
[2055.84 → 2056.48] it's Nintendo.
[2057.08 → 2058.02] So what they want
[2058.02 → 2059.20] probably is blood.
[2059.48 → 2059.86] Yeah,
[2059.94 → 2060.30] probably.
[2060.48 → 2062.00] They're like massive jerks.
[2064.34 → 2066.20] But the court did push it through.
[2066.90 → 2067.30] Yeah.
[2067.46 → 2068.00] So it really,
[2068.16 → 2068.96] it is on the court.
[2069.52 → 2070.84] And that's just...
[2070.84 → 2072.24] I'm just mad at everybody.
[2072.48 → 2073.68] I just want to make that part clear.
[2073.88 → 2074.00] Like,
[2074.10 → 2074.60] it's...
[2074.60 → 2075.02] I'm not...
[2075.02 → 2076.20] I'm not saying the court
[2076.20 → 2077.58] is not to blame,
[2077.74 → 2078.26] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2078.36 → 2079.58] I just think this is...
[2079.58 → 2080.18] Whatever.
[2080.44 → 2081.46] I don't personally care.
[2081.48 → 2082.00] I don't know enough
[2082.00 → 2082.82] about that kind of stuff.
[2083.58 → 2085.88] The result is not okay.
[2086.50 → 2086.68] Yeah.
[2086.72 → 2088.00] Our discussion question here
[2088.00 → 2089.22] is actually addressing
[2089.22 → 2090.34] how unusual
[2090.34 → 2093.18] this harsh punishment is
[2093.18 → 2094.48] and kind of asks,
[2094.66 → 2096.68] does this actually reduce piracy?
[2097.18 → 2097.58] Or,
[2097.86 → 2098.38] I mean,
[2098.44 → 2099.26] knowing what we know
[2099.26 → 2100.54] about human nature,
[2100.68 → 2101.74] the way people gamble,
[2101.90 → 2102.18] right?
[2102.88 → 2103.78] Are people just going to
[2103.78 → 2105.34] keep making mod chips?
[2105.82 → 2107.04] I think it's going to be way worse.
[2107.10 → 2107.92] R4 cartridges
[2107.92 → 2108.70] and whatever else,
[2108.82 → 2110.00] knowing that
[2110.00 → 2111.46] they probably
[2111.46 → 2112.80] will escape
[2112.80 → 2113.72] any kind of punishment
[2113.72 → 2114.46] at all
[2114.46 → 2115.72] and probably
[2115.72 → 2116.76] someone else
[2116.76 → 2117.58] is just going to get
[2117.58 → 2118.58] strung up to the tree
[2118.58 → 2119.68] while they continue
[2119.68 → 2120.42] to run amok.
[2120.84 → 2122.14] All I've seen online
[2122.14 → 2122.74] about this
[2122.74 → 2124.54] in a lot of the circles
[2124.54 → 2125.56] that I end up seeing
[2125.56 → 2126.56] is just people
[2126.56 → 2127.36] deck thumping,
[2127.84 → 2128.00] like,
[2128.16 → 2128.96] just pirate everything
[2128.96 → 2129.48] from Nintendo
[2129.48 → 2130.34] you possibly can.
[2130.76 → 2132.10] That's the main communication
[2132.10 → 2132.90] I've seen out of this.
[2133.26 → 2133.42] Like,
[2133.52 → 2134.94] they're not succeeding
[2134.94 → 2136.24] in making people
[2136.24 → 2136.94] not mad.
[2137.24 → 2137.94] I'll say that much.
[2137.94 → 2138.18] Now,
[2138.30 → 2139.98] there's some perfect points
[2139.98 → 2140.76] that are being brought up
[2140.76 → 2141.64] by the float plane chat
[2141.64 → 2142.26] right now.
[2142.92 → 2143.84] Vine Will says,
[2143.94 → 2144.68] I've seen allegations
[2144.68 → 2145.90] that the mod chip company,
[2146.10 → 2146.86] not him personally,
[2147.00 → 2147.58] but the company,
[2148.06 → 2148.44] brought in
[2148.44 → 2149.78] an astonishing amount
[2149.78 → 2150.30] of revenue,
[2150.48 → 2151.58] up to $10 million
[2151.58 → 2152.50] over time.
[2152.96 → 2153.68] And that
[2153.68 → 2155.26] is fair enough.
[2155.26 → 2156.60] it is well within
[2156.60 → 2157.58] Nintendo's right
[2157.58 → 2158.84] to chase
[2158.84 → 2160.28] that lost revenue.
[2160.64 → 2161.64] But it's pretty clear
[2161.64 → 2162.94] that Gary Bowser
[2162.94 → 2164.24] doesn't have it.
[2164.40 → 2164.64] Yes.
[2165.76 → 2166.44] So what?
[2166.56 → 2167.62] Just because
[2167.62 → 2168.62] he was the one
[2168.62 → 2169.22] that you managed
[2169.22 → 2169.96] to nail down.
[2170.38 → 2171.34] So you shouldn't go,
[2171.72 → 2172.00] so,
[2172.00 → 2172.16] so,
[2172.34 → 2173.88] it feels like
[2173.88 → 2174.28] they're,
[2174.66 → 2175.56] they've gone after
[2175.56 → 2176.62] like a low-level
[2176.62 → 2177.54] mob crony
[2177.54 → 2178.88] and,
[2178.96 → 2179.40] you know,
[2179.46 → 2179.92] pretty much,
[2180.10 → 2180.22] you know,
[2180.22 → 2180.82] dropped the book on him.
[2180.98 → 2181.38] Yeah,
[2181.58 → 2183.04] stapled him to the cross
[2183.04 → 2184.56] and kind of gone,
[2185.42 → 2185.94] ha ha,
[2186.08 → 2186.30] victory.
[2186.30 → 2186.96] Yeah, we did it guys.
[2187.16 → 2187.44] Ha ha,
[2187.54 → 2187.86] business.
[2188.28 → 2189.20] When the boss
[2189.20 → 2190.52] is still walking free,
[2191.40 → 2192.74] this is not the win
[2192.74 → 2193.78] that you think it is.
[2194.10 → 2194.58] Because,
[2195.66 → 2196.92] if organized crime
[2196.92 → 2197.94] has taught us anything,
[2198.46 → 2199.76] it's that there's always
[2199.76 → 2201.18] someone low down
[2201.18 → 2202.66] who is going to be
[2202.66 → 2203.82] put in the way
[2203.82 → 2204.60] to take the fall.
[2204.60 → 2205.48] Fed to the machine
[2205.48 → 2207.64] to satiate whoever
[2207.64 → 2208.38] or whatever else.
[2208.56 → 2209.46] And I'm not saying
[2209.46 → 2210.10] that what,
[2210.16 → 2212.14] what Mr. Bowser did
[2212.14 → 2213.50] is justifiable.
[2213.72 → 2213.84] No.
[2213.94 → 2214.56] I'm not saying
[2214.56 → 2215.38] that it was legal.
[2215.58 → 2215.76] Nope.
[2216.16 → 2216.58] Um,
[2216.66 → 2217.60] I'm just saying
[2217.60 → 2218.06] that
[2218.06 → 2220.68] compared to almost
[2220.68 → 2221.52] anything else
[2221.52 → 2222.72] that I have seen,
[2222.86 → 2223.40] uh,
[2223.40 → 2224.74] this really does
[2224.74 → 2226.00] seem to fit the definition
[2226.00 → 2227.74] of cruel and unusual punishment.
[2228.02 → 2228.20] Yeah.
[2228.36 → 2228.60] To,
[2228.70 → 2230.72] to not just penalize
[2230.72 → 2231.94] what someone has,
[2231.94 → 2233.44] but what they will
[2233.44 → 2234.60] ever have,
[2235.06 → 2235.34] uh,
[2235.34 → 2236.46] when we're not talking,
[2236.56 → 2236.88] again,
[2236.98 → 2238.10] we're not talking about
[2238.10 → 2239.06] a situation
[2239.06 → 2240.06] where it could be justified.
[2240.06 → 2240.98] We're not talking about
[2240.98 → 2241.46] the livelihood
[2241.46 → 2242.74] and well-being of a child,
[2242.88 → 2243.50] um,
[2243.54 → 2243.76] you know,
[2243.78 → 2244.68] that had no choice
[2244.68 → 2245.22] in the matter.
[2245.90 → 2246.26] Um,
[2247.20 → 2247.50] I mean,
[2247.54 → 2248.60] I guess Nintendo had,
[2248.82 → 2248.94] well,
[2248.96 → 2249.70] they did have a choice
[2249.70 → 2250.12] in the matter,
[2250.12 → 2250.42] actually.
[2250.42 → 2251.54] They didn't have to pursue
[2251.54 → 2253.34] such a ridiculous
[2253.34 → 2254.34] punishment.
[2255.74 → 2256.18] Yeah,
[2256.20 → 2256.42] and like,
[2256.50 → 2256.72] the court,
[2256.78 → 2257.72] the court put it through.
[2258.90 → 2259.30] So,
[2259.66 → 2260.12] just like,
[2260.24 → 2261.00] re-upping that.
[2261.14 → 2261.32] Yep.
[2261.44 → 2261.68] Yes,
[2261.68 → 2262.60] the court put it through.
[2262.76 → 2263.72] Massive problems there.
[2263.72 → 2264.62] But Nintendo also had
[2264.62 → 2265.28] the option
[2265.28 → 2267.12] to get the
[2267.68 → 2268.90] to get the verdict
[2268.90 → 2271.40] and basically say,
[2271.98 → 2272.22] well,
[2272.42 → 2273.72] we're happy to reduce this.
[2273.76 → 2275.04] We're happy to reduce this,
[2275.36 → 2276.76] but let this be,
[2276.84 → 2277.82] because that's a big part
[2277.82 → 2278.74] of what Nintendo thinks
[2278.74 → 2279.62] is such a win here,
[2279.68 → 2281.38] is that this is a precedent now.
[2281.84 → 2282.28] Now,
[2282.48 → 2283.42] they've got a precedent
[2283.42 → 2284.30] to point to and go,
[2284.46 → 2284.70] yeah,
[2284.88 → 2285.52] that's right,
[2285.84 → 2286.70] don't do it,
[2287.32 → 2288.40] but it could have been.
[2288.90 → 2289.82] They could have made
[2289.82 → 2290.66] an example out of
[2290.66 → 2291.24] Gary Bowser
[2291.24 → 2293.06] without actually destroying
[2293.06 → 2293.94] the rest of his life.
[2294.12 → 2295.06] And you know what?
[2295.24 → 2296.32] From my point of view,
[2296.60 → 2298.28] if this had then come up again,
[2298.94 → 2299.74] case number two,
[2300.00 → 2300.62] and they'd gone,
[2301.56 → 2301.98] all right,
[2302.04 → 2303.08] we're litigating this again,
[2303.68 → 2305.26] we've got our precedent now,
[2305.88 → 2307.30] we're throwing the full book
[2307.30 → 2307.70] at them,
[2308.22 → 2310.06] I could even see it.
[2310.10 → 2310.96] At least they fired
[2310.96 → 2311.70] a warning shot.
[2312.06 → 2313.22] I still don't think so.
[2313.70 → 2314.10] Because,
[2314.18 → 2314.36] like,
[2314.46 → 2315.16] there's no,
[2315.16 → 2316.16] there are no limitations
[2316.16 → 2316.62] on this.
[2316.62 → 2317.28] I'm not saying
[2317.28 → 2317.94] it would be right.
[2318.72 → 2319.26] I'm saying
[2319.26 → 2319.82] it would be better
[2319.82 → 2320.44] than this.
[2320.98 → 2322.00] I wouldn't have even thought,
[2322.06 → 2322.86] I wouldn't have even thought
[2322.86 → 2323.74] this is possible.
[2324.40 → 2324.64] Yeah,
[2325.18 → 2325.42] yeah,
[2325.68 → 2325.96] yeah,
[2326.24 → 2326.50] yeah.
[2326.70 → 2327.52] The fact that there's
[2327.52 → 2328.78] no statute of limitations
[2328.78 → 2329.56] whatsoever.
[2330.60 → 2331.56] The fact that
[2331.56 → 2333.90] the cost of living,
[2334.52 → 2334.96] like the
[2334.96 → 2336.02] the liable wage
[2336.02 → 2336.74] in,
[2337.30 → 2338.64] I think he's in Toronto?
[2339.72 → 2340.86] I don't know.
[2341.08 → 2341.84] I don't remember.
[2341.84 → 2342.84] The cost of living,
[2343.32 → 2343.84] liable wage
[2343.84 → 2345.26] in Canada in general,
[2345.26 → 2346.50] but especially in like
[2346.50 → 2346.90] Vancouver,
[2347.12 → 2347.54] Toronto,
[2347.74 → 2348.04] Montreal,
[2348.04 → 2349.06] all these types of places
[2349.06 → 2351.34] is so high.
[2351.46 → 2352.08] Like the
[2352.08 → 2353.32] the cost of living in Canada
[2353.32 → 2354.90] versus the average income
[2354.90 → 2356.20] is a really,
[2356.36 → 2357.52] really rough calculation
[2357.52 → 2358.00] right now.
[2358.12 → 2358.30] Yeah.
[2358.40 → 2359.86] Canada is constantly falling
[2359.86 → 2361.82] in average GDP.
[2362.82 → 2363.48] Like you,
[2363.54 → 2364.16] you look at like
[2364.16 → 2365.40] the States versus Canada
[2365.40 → 2366.78] and the States' incomes
[2366.78 → 2367.72] and Canada's incomes
[2367.72 → 2368.28] are going up
[2368.28 → 2369.56] at relatively similar rates,
[2369.56 → 2370.96] but Canada's cost of living
[2370.96 → 2371.46] is going up
[2371.46 → 2372.22] at a higher rate.
[2372.32 → 2373.02] So like we're,
[2373.20 → 2374.80] we're getting less like,
[2374.80 → 2376.44] whatever you call it,
[2376.96 → 2377.80] play with money
[2377.80 → 2379.08] after your cost of living
[2379.08 → 2380.40] constantly.
[2380.68 → 2381.28] Canada is getting
[2381.28 → 2381.52] really,
[2381.64 → 2382.32] really rough to be in.
[2382.72 → 2384.28] Now he has to do
[2384.28 → 2385.90] 25 to 30% more
[2385.90 → 2387.06] on top of that.
[2387.64 → 2388.82] And as far as I know,
[2388.84 → 2390.10] doesn't have job prospects
[2390.10 → 2390.44] lined up.
[2390.54 → 2392.16] Like what does he do?
[2392.30 → 2392.70] The other thing
[2392.70 → 2393.98] that's really offending me here,
[2394.04 → 2396.20] I think SofaKingStupid
[2396.20 → 2397.50] over on Twitch
[2397.50 → 2399.52] is proving their username
[2399.52 → 2400.82] kind of inaccurate here.
[2401.26 → 2402.08] Points out,
[2402.08 → 2404.10] and this is a perfect point,
[2404.76 → 2406.06] that maybe part of what
[2406.06 → 2407.52] we're so mad about right now,
[2407.56 → 2408.68] even if we didn't think of it,
[2408.86 → 2410.64] is the number of
[2410.64 → 2411.72] white collar crimes
[2411.72 → 2412.68] like this,
[2413.44 → 2414.40] that by comparison,
[2415.10 → 2416.90] just get a little slap
[2416.90 → 2417.40] on the wrist.
[2417.56 → 2418.92] That was our intro point, man.
[2419.04 → 2419.54] Oh, I don't know.
[2419.62 → 2420.86] I was just mad already.
[2420.98 → 2421.74] I was talking about companies,
[2421.88 → 2422.20] I guess,
[2422.28 → 2423.02] but you're talking about...
[2423.02 → 2423.70] No, I'm talking about
[2423.70 → 2424.48] even individual
[2424.48 → 2425.36] white collar crime.
[2425.46 → 2425.58] I mean,
[2425.62 → 2426.36] why is the wolf
[2426.36 → 2427.64] of Wall Street walking free?
[2427.64 → 2428.04] Yeah.
[2430.60 → 2431.12] How...
[2431.12 → 2431.72] How...
[2431.72 → 2434.38] Why doesn't he
[2434.38 → 2435.58] owe whatever
[2435.58 → 2436.66] for the rest of his life?
[2436.68 → 2437.02] To be clear,
[2437.08 → 2438.96] I don't know the exact details
[2438.96 → 2440.20] of what went down
[2440.20 → 2441.16] in that particular
[2441.16 → 2442.68] particular takedown.
[2442.90 → 2443.90] The point is that
[2443.90 → 2444.84] it doesn't matter,
[2445.54 → 2445.80] right?
[2446.08 → 2447.80] There are plenty of examples.
[2448.32 → 2448.82] Like, I mean,
[2448.86 → 2450.24] the 2008 financial crisis,
[2450.50 → 2451.50] did anyone
[2451.50 → 2453.06] even get jail time?
[2453.38 → 2453.70] Pretty...
[2453.70 → 2454.46] I don't think so.
[2455.10 → 2455.82] I don't know
[2455.82 → 2456.84] much about it,
[2456.86 → 2457.48] but I don't think so.
[2457.48 → 2458.98] Yeah, I think I remember
[2458.98 → 2459.78] reading that there's like
[2459.78 → 2461.18] one or two, like,
[2461.34 → 2461.68] fall guys.
[2461.68 → 2462.30] Right, when it was like
[2462.30 → 2464.36] a huge array of people.
[2464.54 → 2464.64] Yeah.
[2464.64 → 2465.10] Like, it should not
[2465.10 → 2465.82] have just been that.
[2467.58 → 2468.12] One per...
[2468.12 → 2468.98] Apparently one guy...
[2468.98 → 2470.22] Yeah, as if one person
[2470.22 → 2470.96] did the whole thing.
[2471.06 → 2471.30] Sure.
[2471.54 → 2471.80] Okay.
[2472.64 → 2473.38] Yeah, I don't know.
[2473.44 → 2473.86] I'm just...
[2473.86 → 2474.30] I'm pissed.
[2474.58 → 2475.12] I hate this.
[2475.60 → 2476.00] It's stupid.
[2476.26 → 2476.86] You shouldn't be able
[2476.86 → 2477.78] to condemn someone,
[2478.06 → 2479.04] and that's basically
[2479.04 → 2479.40] what they did.
[2479.40 → 2480.02] That's basically
[2480.02 → 2480.76] what this is.
[2480.84 → 2480.98] Yeah.
[2481.18 → 2481.36] Yeah.
[2481.52 → 2482.04] Like, oh,
[2482.26 → 2483.66] oh, here's a perfect example.
[2484.78 → 2486.74] Oh, what's her face?
[2486.74 → 2488.96] The one that had
[2488.96 → 2493.20] the college scholarships company
[2493.20 → 2494.20] or something like that.
[2494.96 → 2495.32] Oh.
[2496.72 → 2498.04] College scholarships.
[2500.78 → 2501.46] Scam.
[2501.72 → 2502.44] Startup.
[2503.02 → 2504.24] Man, I...
[2504.24 → 2506.56] This is really great.
[2506.86 → 2507.74] Charlie...
[2507.74 → 2508.74] Oh, I thought it was...
[2508.74 → 2509.74] I thought it was...
[2509.74 → 2512.32] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[2512.32 → 2512.76] Here we go.
[2512.96 → 2513.66] The startup founder
[2513.66 → 2514.72] who fooled J.P. Morgan
[2514.72 → 2515.32] into spending
[2515.32 → 2517.02] $175 million
[2517.02 → 2518.64] on her startup
[2518.64 → 2519.98] by just fabricating accounts.
[2520.64 → 2522.16] I don't actually think
[2522.16 → 2523.16] she's been sentenced yet,
[2523.28 → 2524.48] but this reminds me.
[2524.58 → 2526.40] I read a hilarious article.
[2526.70 → 2527.22] Funny?
[2527.46 → 2527.78] Weird?
[2528.24 → 2529.18] It was an article
[2529.18 → 2531.42] that investigated
[2531.42 → 2532.58] how many of Forbes'
[2532.78 → 2533.84] 30 under 30
[2533.84 → 2536.16] eventually ended up
[2536.16 → 2537.32] like in prison.
[2537.32 → 2541.38] It was like a lot.
[2541.58 → 2542.68] Like Sam Bankman-Fried,
[2543.22 → 2543.76] her,
[2545.52 → 2546.32] the...
[2547.74 → 2548.54] Martin Skrelp.
[2548.66 → 2549.06] I don't know
[2549.06 → 2549.64] if he was Forbes'
[2549.74 → 2550.26] 30 under 30,
[2550.38 → 2551.66] but it seems like
[2551.66 → 2552.26] he probably would have been.
[2552.32 → 2553.20] Might have been on the list.
[2553.30 → 2553.86] Not sure.
[2554.16 → 2554.74] But then there was
[2554.74 → 2555.74] the one with the fake,
[2555.82 → 2556.10] I think,
[2556.18 → 2557.52] diabetes testing thing.
[2558.20 → 2559.06] Is that Elizabeth Holmes?
[2559.06 → 2560.00] Oh, I remember this.
[2560.10 → 2560.28] Yeah.
[2560.66 → 2561.30] Yeah, hold on.
[2561.36 → 2561.64] Hold on.
[2561.84 → 2562.96] That was her thing,
[2562.96 → 2563.32] I think.
[2563.32 → 2565.22] Wow, she's the second
[2565.22 → 2566.24] most popular Elizabeth
[2566.24 → 2567.04] after Olsen
[2567.04 → 2567.90] and before Banks,
[2568.34 → 2570.04] according to my search history anyway.
[2570.44 → 2571.58] Anyway, she has appealed
[2571.58 → 2573.52] her unjust conviction, apparently.
[2574.52 → 2575.64] So like, okay,
[2576.58 → 2578.10] she wants to stay out of prison.
[2578.16 → 2580.02] Someone in Twitch chat said,
[2580.12 → 2580.74] didn't Gary Bowser
[2580.74 → 2581.62] commit wire fraud,
[2581.72 → 2582.44] install ransomware
[2582.44 → 2583.22] on people's devices
[2583.22 → 2584.22] and a bunch of other
[2584.22 → 2585.64] non-Nintendo related crimes?
[2586.02 → 2586.68] Isn't that what he got
[2586.68 → 2587.40] really messed up over?
[2587.68 → 2589.10] At no point in time
[2589.10 → 2590.06] in this conversation
[2590.06 → 2591.10] did we ever say
[2591.10 → 2592.44] that he was a good person.
[2592.44 → 2593.08] Yeah.
[2593.54 → 2594.62] I don't know anything about him.
[2594.72 → 2595.32] Not even once.
[2595.78 → 2596.06] Nope.
[2596.82 → 2598.82] What I said,
[2598.94 → 2600.28] what I started out with
[2600.28 → 2601.32] was that
[2601.32 → 2602.40] in the Canadian
[2602.40 → 2603.46] Charter of Rights
[2603.46 → 2604.32] and Freedoms,
[2604.58 → 2605.46] et cetera, et cetera,
[2605.46 → 2605.96] I think we have
[2605.96 → 2607.08] a constitution too actually
[2607.08 → 2607.76] now I think about it.
[2607.80 → 2608.22] I can't remember
[2608.22 → 2609.04] what the documents are called,
[2609.12 → 2609.50] doesn't matter.
[2609.58 → 2610.26] The point is
[2610.26 → 2613.06] that cruel and unusual punishment
[2613.06 → 2615.24] is not cool
[2615.24 → 2617.76] and this really feels
[2617.76 → 2618.48] like it to me.
[2618.80 → 2619.02] Yeah.
[2619.44 → 2619.90] All right.
[2620.96 → 2621.64] Let's move on
[2621.64 → 2622.92] to our next segment here.
[2623.08 → 2624.06] I just want to explain
[2624.06 → 2624.90] merch messages.
[2625.06 → 2625.54] Those of you
[2625.54 → 2626.70] who are new to the show
[2626.70 → 2627.44] might think,
[2627.58 → 2628.60] ooh, I should send
[2628.60 → 2629.48] a super chat
[2629.48 → 2630.58] or some Twitch bits.
[2631.08 → 2631.92] Hey, how about you
[2631.92 → 2632.74] don't do that
[2632.74 → 2634.28] and instead of feeding
[2634.28 → 2634.92] some more money
[2634.92 → 2636.40] into the overflowing coffers
[2636.40 → 2638.06] of Amazon and Google,
[2638.28 → 2639.04] you could send
[2639.04 → 2640.74] a merch message instead.
[2641.40 → 2642.22] The main benefit
[2642.22 → 2643.18] is that instead
[2643.18 → 2644.46] of just digital pixels
[2644.46 → 2645.10] on a screen,
[2645.30 → 2646.50] you can get digital pixels
[2646.50 → 2647.12] on a screen
[2647.12 → 2649.10] and your order
[2649.10 → 2649.52] in the mail
[2649.52 → 2650.78] from lttstore.com.
[2650.94 → 2651.68] All you have to do
[2651.68 → 2652.68] to send a merch message
[2652.68 → 2653.42] which will get
[2653.42 → 2654.46] your little shout out,
[2654.56 → 2654.74] you know,
[2654.82 → 2655.32] hey mom
[2655.32 → 2657.10] or happy birthday, Janice
[2657.10 → 2657.80] or whatever it is
[2657.80 → 2658.72] that you want to put down there.
[2659.22 → 2660.10] You can get that
[2660.10 → 2660.98] popping up on the bottom
[2660.98 → 2661.54] of the screen
[2661.54 → 2662.92] and you will get
[2662.92 → 2663.56] your order in the mail.
[2663.62 → 2664.52] Did I already say that part?
[2664.74 → 2664.92] Right.
[2665.28 → 2666.16] In order to do that,
[2666.30 → 2666.80] all you have to do
[2666.80 → 2668.08] is go to lttstore.com,
[2668.18 → 2668.84] check out whether
[2668.84 → 2669.74] it's some of our new items
[2669.74 → 2670.68] like the WAG hoodie
[2670.68 → 2673.14] or the mystery plaid flannel
[2673.14 → 2674.74] and then in the checkout
[2674.74 → 2675.90] you will see a box
[2675.90 → 2677.04] that will prompt you
[2677.04 → 2677.60] to fill it out
[2677.60 → 2678.64] if we are live
[2678.64 → 2680.48] and leave us a merch message.
[2680.90 → 2682.10] We will go through them
[2682.10 → 2683.16] to the best of our ability.
[2683.34 → 2684.72] I am not going to promise
[2684.72 → 2685.52] that we are going to get
[2685.52 → 2686.34] through all of them.
[2686.82 → 2687.28] Oh wow,
[2687.40 → 2688.56] our dashboard's been upgraded.
[2688.90 → 2689.82] This is super cool.
[2690.24 → 2690.92] Hold on a second,
[2691.02 → 2691.84] I'm just going to show
[2691.84 → 2693.00] my dashboard real quick.
[2693.56 → 2694.32] Book, book, book, book, book, book.
[2694.46 → 2696.40] We now have merch messages
[2696.40 → 2697.02] per minute.
[2697.68 → 2698.32] Oh, where'd it go?
[2699.34 → 2699.98] In queue.
[2700.12 → 2700.44] It was here.
[2700.50 → 2701.26] Yeah, here we go.
[2701.36 → 2702.24] Why are you showing this?
[2702.54 → 2703.14] Yeah, I don't know.
[2703.16 → 2703.76] I thought it was cool.
[2703.84 → 2704.88] We just upgraded the dashboard.
[2705.14 → 2705.46] Okay.
[2706.24 → 2706.50] What?
[2706.80 → 2707.18] It's cool.
[2707.54 → 2707.66] Yeah.
[2707.78 → 2708.76] Merch messages per minute
[2708.76 → 2709.24] is three.
[2709.38 → 2710.08] Oh, watch this.
[2710.14 → 2710.78] Next announcement.
[2710.98 → 2711.66] So you're going to see it.
[2712.16 → 2712.74] Did it go?
[2712.88 → 2713.38] Is it going to go?
[2713.54 → 2713.80] I don't know.
[2713.84 → 2714.20] It might go.
[2714.44 → 2714.64] Something.
[2714.90 → 2715.12] Anyway.
[2715.34 → 2715.88] The point is,
[2716.24 → 2717.38] our cool little dashboard
[2717.38 → 2718.16] got some upgrades.
[2718.26 → 2718.62] Hey, thanks,
[2718.68 → 2719.24] Float plane team.
[2721.32 → 2722.60] And so we'll go through them
[2722.60 → 2723.92] and to the best of our ability,
[2724.10 → 2725.00] answer as many of them
[2725.00 → 2725.42] as we can.
[2725.52 → 2726.10] Dan, you want to hit us
[2726.10 → 2726.72] with some merch messages?
[2727.02 → 2727.30] Sure.
[2727.44 → 2728.16] First one that's up,
[2728.46 → 2729.46] here from Bucky.
[2729.76 → 2731.12] It's eager for a bigger
[2731.12 → 2732.08] wag hoodie.
[2732.32 → 2733.46] He's got a 90-pound
[2733.46 → 2734.48] GSD,
[2734.76 → 2735.88] 38-inch chest.
[2736.52 → 2738.94] Any advice for an unemployed
[2738.94 → 2740.84] embedded C programmer
[2740.84 → 2742.68] with no online portfolio
[2742.68 → 2744.44] how to catch up
[2744.44 → 2745.66] on programming shifts
[2745.66 → 2746.98] from the past 20 years?
[2747.50 → 2749.00] Yeah, I was going to...
[2749.00 → 2749.38] Oh, yeah.
[2749.64 → 2751.00] I knew that ending was coming.
[2751.10 → 2751.66] Sorry, I'm not trying
[2751.66 → 2752.22] to laugh at you.
[2753.14 → 2753.62] Wow.
[2756.42 → 2757.26] Embedded C.
[2759.26 → 2760.32] I mean, Luke.
[2762.90 → 2763.38] What?
[2763.56 → 2763.96] Go ahead.
[2764.26 → 2765.02] Oh, yeah.
[2765.58 → 2766.06] Wow.
[2766.40 → 2767.64] Do you want to
[2767.64 → 2768.46] is a question
[2768.46 → 2769.12] that I would ask
[2769.12 → 2770.28] because there are still
[2770.28 → 2771.18] jobs for that.
[2771.34 → 2772.44] Like, do you want to just
[2772.44 → 2774.24] look for one of those?
[2774.72 → 2775.72] You don't technically
[2775.72 → 2776.68] have to have
[2776.68 → 2779.22] portfolio things.
[2779.30 → 2780.22] What is this?
[2781.08 → 2781.84] What did you do?
[2782.46 → 2783.10] I didn't do anything.
[2783.24 → 2783.52] Nothing.
[2783.74 → 2784.38] There's something else
[2784.38 → 2784.84] going on.
[2785.96 → 2786.40] Okay.
[2786.54 → 2787.84] That's really wacky.
[2787.90 → 2789.28] But anyway...
[2789.28 → 2793.76] Sorry, that's extremely distracting.
[2793.96 → 2794.44] I'm going to click
[2794.44 → 2795.02] on another window
[2795.02 → 2796.18] so it stops doing that to me.
[2796.36 → 2796.70] All right.
[2796.74 → 2797.16] We're good.
[2800.12 → 2801.38] Yeah, I would just try
[2801.38 → 2802.50] to continue with the job
[2802.50 → 2803.20] in your field.
[2803.38 → 2803.94] There's work
[2803.94 → 2805.08] for embedded C programmers.
[2806.98 → 2808.12] There, like, definitely is.
[2808.52 → 2809.38] I know you don't have
[2809.38 → 2810.28] an online portfolio,
[2810.60 → 2812.30] but if you've been doing it
[2812.30 → 2813.22] for 20 years,
[2813.22 → 2813.86] it sounds like
[2813.86 → 2814.54] you should be able
[2814.54 → 2815.66] to pass a coding test
[2815.66 → 2816.38] or something else.
[2816.56 → 2817.42] Like, I don't know.
[2818.62 → 2819.02] Yeah.
[2819.02 → 2819.54] So basically,
[2819.54 → 2820.12] you're saying
[2820.12 → 2821.50] probably it would be
[2821.50 → 2823.68] easier to change careers
[2823.68 → 2825.92] outright than to...
[2825.92 → 2826.42] Instead of, like,
[2826.54 → 2827.24] fully re-educating...
[2827.24 → 2828.24] Well, no, not 100%.
[2828.24 → 2829.06] But instead of, like,
[2829.14 → 2830.08] fully re-educating
[2830.08 → 2830.48] to, like,
[2830.70 → 2832.56] some web programming setup,
[2832.70 → 2833.48] which is actually
[2833.48 → 2834.20] very different
[2834.20 → 2834.70] than, like,
[2834.78 → 2835.82] embedded C programming,
[2836.02 → 2837.18] I would just try
[2837.18 → 2839.04] to stay in that lane
[2839.04 → 2839.68] where there is
[2839.68 → 2841.72] definitely still work.
[2842.06 → 2842.34] Right.
[2842.34 → 2844.04] Not probably as much work,
[2844.54 → 2845.28] but there's definitely
[2845.28 → 2845.82] still work.
[2845.96 → 2846.80] If you do want
[2846.80 → 2847.38] to flip over,
[2847.78 → 2848.34] there's...
[2848.34 → 2849.76] An absolute
[2849.76 → 2852.00] vast ocean
[2852.00 → 2853.96] of free programming
[2853.96 → 2855.60] learning tools.
[2856.86 → 2857.66] Learn to Code,
[2857.74 → 2858.12] I believe,
[2858.22 → 2859.78] is literally a website.
[2860.28 → 2860.88] I know it was, like,
[2860.90 → 2861.70] a saying a while ago,
[2861.74 → 2862.80] but I think it's a website now.
[2863.32 → 2864.34] There's Leet Code.
[2864.64 → 2865.54] There's Code...
[2865.54 → 2866.44] Free Code Camp.
[2866.64 → 2867.44] There's...
[2867.44 → 2868.46] If you want to pay
[2868.46 → 2869.06] for courses,
[2869.50 → 2870.78] there are some courses from...
[2870.78 → 2871.52] Is it called Udemy?
[2871.52 → 2872.46] I believe it's Udemy.
[2872.86 → 2872.94] Right.
[2872.94 → 2873.68] That are supposed
[2873.68 → 2874.34] to be perfect.
[2874.46 → 2876.24] There are tons of places
[2876.24 → 2876.80] to relearn.
[2877.00 → 2877.38] But, yeah,
[2877.44 → 2878.10] you don't have to.
[2878.40 → 2878.92] You don't have to.
[2879.18 → 2879.56] All right.
[2879.58 → 2880.02] Hit us again.
[2880.74 → 2881.02] Okay.
[2881.10 → 2882.32] Next up from Pablo.
[2883.12 → 2883.52] Luke,
[2883.64 → 2884.34] do you think that
[2884.34 → 2885.44] with the latest generation
[2885.44 → 2886.60] of AI tools...
[2886.60 → 2887.30] Mike is muted.
[2887.78 → 2888.16] Luke,
[2888.20 → 2888.80] do you think that
[2888.80 → 2889.82] with the latest generation
[2889.82 → 2890.86] of AI tools,
[2890.86 → 2892.54] that today's youth
[2892.54 → 2893.18] are going to be
[2893.18 → 2894.16] depriving themselves
[2894.16 → 2895.42] of background learning
[2895.42 → 2896.58] just by getting
[2896.58 → 2898.64] exactly what they ask for
[2898.64 → 2899.54] from the model?
[2901.06 → 2901.92] I feel like that
[2901.92 → 2902.74] exact same question,
[2902.88 → 2903.92] but asked in a slightly
[2903.92 → 2904.36] different way
[2904.36 → 2905.64] with slightly different parameters,
[2905.82 → 2906.88] could have been asked
[2906.88 → 2907.46] about things
[2907.46 → 2908.02] for the last
[2908.02 → 2909.42] huge amount of time.
[2910.70 → 2911.54] I think...
[2911.54 → 2913.74] I would like to think...
[2913.74 → 2914.02] I don't know
[2914.02 → 2914.72] if this is true or not.
[2914.88 → 2915.60] I would like to think
[2915.60 → 2916.06] that most people
[2916.06 → 2916.96] are naturally curious
[2916.96 → 2918.52] and will learn
[2918.52 → 2919.66] more than they need to
[2919.66 → 2920.26] about things.
[2920.26 → 2921.26] And if you want to hit
[2921.26 → 2922.44] a certain level of excellence,
[2923.06 → 2923.90] they're going to have
[2923.90 → 2924.38] to do that.
[2924.62 → 2924.82] So,
[2925.46 → 2926.24] I don't know.
[2926.82 → 2928.34] I think it will compromise it
[2928.34 → 2929.48] in the exact same way
[2929.48 → 2930.68] that people are generally
[2930.68 → 2932.00] not as good at mental math
[2932.00 → 2933.42] as they used to be
[2933.42 → 2934.46] because of the calculator,
[2934.64 → 2935.38] but it's not like people
[2935.38 → 2936.32] can't do math anymore.
[2937.78 → 2938.32] All right.
[2938.34 → 2938.80] Hit us again.
[2939.04 → 2939.38] All right.
[2939.40 → 2940.22] Let's get into some
[2940.22 → 2941.58] rapid fire now, too.
[2942.70 → 2943.10] Linus,
[2943.16 → 2943.88] where's the best place
[2943.88 → 2945.48] to post upper pics?
[2946.50 → 2947.26] Upper pics?
[2947.40 → 2947.70] Yes.
[2947.70 → 2948.66] Of the dogs
[2948.66 → 2949.48] in the wag hoodie.
[2949.80 → 2950.00] Oh,
[2950.00 → 2950.28] I mean,
[2950.32 → 2951.22] I'd love to see them
[2951.22 → 2951.76] on the forum.
[2951.90 → 2952.90] That would be freaking awesome.
[2953.06 → 2953.42] Also,
[2954.06 → 2954.96] the reviews
[2954.96 → 2956.40] on LTTstore.com
[2956.40 → 2957.80] do support image uploads
[2957.80 → 2958.64] even though almost
[2958.64 → 2960.02] nobody uses that feature.
[2960.32 → 2960.52] Both.
[2960.74 → 2960.90] So,
[2961.00 → 2962.10] we would love
[2962.10 → 2962.86] to see pictures
[2962.86 → 2963.64] of your dog
[2963.64 → 2964.96] in the wag hoodie.
[2965.34 → 2966.00] And for that matter,
[2966.14 → 2967.42] we'd love to see pictures
[2967.42 → 2968.48] of your guys' setups
[2968.48 → 2969.92] with the desk pads
[2969.92 → 2970.24] or,
[2970.36 → 2970.88] you know,
[2971.08 → 2972.46] drinking from your water bottle.
[2972.86 → 2973.68] Extra points
[2973.68 → 2974.88] if you Photoshop
[2974.88 → 2975.54] a speech bubble
[2975.54 → 2976.80] that says LTTstore.com
[2976.80 → 2977.34] while you're drinking.
[2977.34 → 2978.56] Yeah.
[2978.56 → 2978.68] Yeah.
[2979.30 → 2979.66] Yeah.
[2979.72 → 2979.98] I mean,
[2980.06 → 2981.38] on the ABCs of gaming,
[2981.58 → 2982.70] I had a couple of people
[2982.70 → 2983.42] send me pictures
[2983.42 → 2984.34] of them reading it
[2984.34 → 2985.12] to their little ones,
[2985.16 → 2986.42] which is super touching.
[2987.06 → 2987.44] There.
[2987.54 → 2987.70] Okay.
[2987.74 → 2988.38] These are rapid fire,
[2988.46 → 2988.78] so I'm supposed
[2988.78 → 2989.54] to go really fast.
[2989.54 → 2990.58] Any meet and greets
[2990.58 → 2991.84] at the shed jewelled
[2991.84 → 2992.62] for LTX?
[2993.00 → 2993.30] Yes.
[2993.96 → 2995.34] It's called LTX.
[2995.62 → 2995.96] Awesome.
[2996.36 → 2998.10] I'll be all over the place.
[2998.30 → 2999.32] The rest of the LTT team
[2999.32 → 3000.44] will be all over the place.
[3000.62 → 3001.44] And we're going to have
[3001.44 → 3003.50] a ton of awesome creators there,
[3003.62 → 3004.40] some of whom
[3004.40 → 3005.38] are going to
[3005.38 → 3006.78] have graciously offered
[3006.78 → 3007.58] to do meet and greets.
[3007.70 → 3008.36] I'm really excited.
[3009.24 → 3010.10] After you started
[3010.10 → 3010.78] Merch Messages,
[3010.90 → 3011.84] did YouTube or Twitch
[3011.84 → 3013.32] give you any push
[3013.32 → 3014.96] for getting away
[3014.96 → 3015.86] from super chats
[3015.86 → 3016.42] or bits?
[3017.02 → 3017.30] No.
[3017.30 → 3017.98] I think YouTube
[3017.98 → 3020.24] was appropriately embarrassed
[3020.24 → 3021.50] that super chats
[3021.50 → 3022.72] were not working properly.
[3022.72 → 3022.94] Still doesn't.
[3023.36 → 3023.72] Yeah.
[3023.84 → 3025.08] They actually were working
[3025.08 → 3025.56] for a bit
[3025.56 → 3026.16] and they seem to be
[3026.16 → 3026.72] broken again,
[3026.82 → 3027.76] so that's pretty cool.
[3028.96 → 3029.72] I don't know
[3029.72 → 3030.56] what else to say
[3030.56 → 3031.24] other than,
[3032.32 → 3033.96] hey guys,
[3034.06 → 3034.36] I mean,
[3034.48 → 3034.74] you know,
[3034.82 → 3035.26] it's not like
[3035.26 → 3035.90] I turned them off.
[3036.04 → 3038.32] I'm happy to take money
[3038.32 → 3038.72] on YouTube
[3038.72 → 3039.56] if people just want
[3039.56 → 3040.36] to throw it at the screen
[3040.36 → 3041.34] and have their chat
[3041.34 → 3043.40] highlighted in the side window
[3043.40 → 3043.86] or whatever.
[3043.98 → 3044.40] By all means,
[3044.50 → 3045.24] go ahead and do your thing.
[3045.56 → 3046.40] But I just think
[3046.40 → 3047.24] that Merch Messages
[3047.24 → 3048.38] not only work properly,
[3048.58 → 3050.30] but they are a much better value
[3050.30 → 3050.88] for our viewers.
[3051.10 → 3051.26] Yeah.
[3051.74 → 3052.16] Also,
[3052.28 → 3052.98] some Flow plane people
[3052.98 → 3053.76] just pointed out
[3053.76 → 3056.02] you can edit your reviews
[3056.02 → 3057.18] and add a picture.
[3057.68 → 3057.88] Oh,
[3058.16 → 3058.42] okay.
[3058.56 → 3059.74] So if there's a review
[3059.74 → 3060.44] that you've already left
[3060.44 → 3060.94] and you want to add
[3060.94 → 3061.74] some picture context,
[3061.82 → 3062.24] you can do that.
[3062.92 → 3064.30] I am buying this screwdriver
[3064.30 → 3065.24] to put together
[3065.24 → 3066.68] $20,000 worth
[3066.68 → 3068.00] of IKEA kitchen cabinets.
[3069.26 → 3070.62] What tech in the kitchen
[3070.62 → 3071.82] that is nice touch
[3071.82 → 3073.34] you would recommend?
[3073.94 → 3074.46] A drill.
[3075.86 → 3077.02] A kitchen drill?
[3077.74 → 3078.02] No,
[3078.10 → 3078.66] I mean like
[3078.66 → 3079.76] do not use
[3079.76 → 3080.46] a hand screwdriver
[3080.46 → 3081.16] to assemble
[3081.16 → 3082.36] that much IKEA furniture.
[3082.60 → 3083.30] For the love
[3083.30 → 3084.22] of all that is good,
[3084.32 → 3085.56] please use a power tool.
[3087.68 → 3089.44] That's so much.
[3092.38 → 3092.86] Luke,
[3092.96 → 3095.02] what's the most frustrating bug
[3095.02 → 3096.04] you have ever had
[3096.04 → 3096.50] to deal with?
[3096.50 → 3100.98] It broke him.
[3101.10 → 3102.00] It's the loot bug.
[3103.14 → 3104.72] The one where I start thinking
[3104.72 → 3106.44] and then all I can see
[3106.44 → 3107.30] is an hourglass
[3107.30 → 3107.92] turning around
[3107.92 → 3108.78] inside my own brain.
[3109.62 → 3110.56] I'm not going to give
[3110.56 → 3111.06] a specific,
[3111.34 → 3112.94] but literally any time
[3112.94 → 3114.50] I go to be excited
[3114.50 → 3115.80] to show something to Linus
[3115.80 → 3116.62] and then it just like
[3116.62 → 3117.90] immediately shatters
[3117.90 → 3118.80] in front of my eyes,
[3119.20 → 3121.42] I'll just insert that scenario
[3121.42 → 3123.12] instead of a particular bug.
[3123.38 → 3124.34] It happens a lot.
[3124.34 → 3125.06] It's so,
[3125.56 → 3126.90] I'll like be messing
[3126.90 → 3128.32] with this thing all day
[3128.32 → 3129.36] and then I'll be like,
[3129.44 → 3129.70] all right,
[3129.80 → 3130.08] sweet.
[3130.20 → 3131.86] It's like our scheduled meeting,
[3131.96 → 3132.76] time to go show Linus.
[3132.80 → 3133.82] He clicks on one thing
[3133.82 → 3134.40] and it's just like,
[3135.24 → 3136.98] immediate break.
[3137.08 → 3138.12] I do have that effect
[3138.12 → 3138.68] on things.
[3139.32 → 3139.62] I mean,
[3139.62 → 3140.12] it's good
[3140.12 → 3140.78] because then we get
[3140.78 → 3141.52] to try to fix it
[3141.52 → 3142.28] before we release it,
[3142.32 → 3142.68] but like,
[3143.72 → 3144.76] yeah.
[3145.08 → 3145.88] And last one,
[3145.98 → 3146.78] any updates
[3146.78 → 3148.74] on the LTT laptop bag?
[3149.48 → 3149.88] Yes.
[3150.84 → 3151.78] We're working on it.
[3152.84 → 3153.54] Amazing update.
[3153.54 → 3154.42] All right,
[3154.46 → 3155.12] let's jump into
[3155.12 → 3156.38] another topic here.
[3157.52 → 3158.58] Game devs
[3158.58 → 3159.92] are cracking down
[3159.92 → 3161.32] on hardware cheating.
[3161.42 → 3162.22] We've talked a fair bit
[3162.22 → 3163.18] about hardware cheating
[3163.18 → 3163.82] in the past,
[3163.90 → 3164.64] but what's funny
[3164.64 → 3166.92] is this particular method
[3166.92 → 3167.92] of hardware cheating
[3167.92 → 3170.20] is not really
[3170.20 → 3171.50] what we focused on.
[3171.86 → 3172.92] So we had talked
[3172.92 → 3174.44] about things like
[3174.44 → 3176.50] a robot arm
[3176.50 → 3177.84] that would move
[3177.84 → 3178.88] your mouse for you
[3178.88 → 3179.96] to point at an enemy.
[3180.10 → 3181.30] So a type of aim bot
[3181.30 → 3182.14] that would be
[3182.14 → 3183.50] pretty much impossible
[3183.50 → 3184.88] for software to detect
[3184.88 → 3185.74] because there are
[3185.74 → 3186.92] no additional processes
[3186.92 → 3187.76] running alongside
[3187.76 → 3188.50] the game.
[3189.54 → 3190.42] But this still
[3190.42 → 3191.42] actually wouldn't stop that
[3191.42 → 3192.10] because a lot of those
[3192.10 → 3193.28] use normal mice.
[3193.44 → 3193.66] Right.
[3193.78 → 3194.94] But the thing is
[3194.94 → 3196.30] that this kind
[3196.30 → 3197.20] of hardware cheating
[3197.20 → 3198.56] isn't something
[3198.56 → 3199.28] that I ever really
[3199.28 → 3200.30] thought about
[3200.30 → 3201.40] in spite of the fact
[3201.40 → 3202.00] that I'm a bit
[3202.00 → 3203.14] of a keyboard mouse
[3203.14 → 3204.14] supremacist.
[3204.46 → 3205.74] I still didn't think of it.
[3206.36 → 3206.92] Activision,
[3207.12 → 3207.38] Bungee,
[3207.38 → 3209.14] Ubisoft are evidently
[3209.14 → 3210.48] cracking down on cheating
[3210.48 → 3212.40] via hardware modules
[3212.40 → 3213.76] that allow the user
[3213.76 → 3214.52] to bypass
[3214.52 → 3215.94] standard software
[3215.94 → 3217.20] anti-cheat detection.
[3217.62 → 3219.06] So the kind of
[3219.06 → 3219.68] anti-cheat
[3219.68 → 3221.04] that they're detecting
[3221.04 → 3222.16] is users
[3222.16 → 3223.62] who are disguising
[3223.62 → 3224.34] their keyboard
[3224.34 → 3225.08] and mouse
[3225.08 → 3226.84] as a game controller.
[3226.98 → 3227.24] Yes.
[3227.44 → 3228.42] And then competing
[3228.42 → 3230.38] in game controller lobbies
[3230.38 → 3231.64] with like aim lock
[3231.64 → 3233.18] obviously superior
[3233.18 → 3234.58] keyboard and mouse
[3234.58 → 3235.88] plus
[3235.88 → 3238.16] the like auto aim
[3238.16 → 3238.70] and aim lock
[3238.70 → 3239.10] that you get
[3239.10 → 3239.76] with a controller.
[3240.52 → 3240.96] Unbeatable
[3240.96 → 3242.20] because now
[3242.20 → 3243.10] you can snap
[3243.10 → 3244.24] onto people way faster.
[3244.46 → 3245.54] You can switch targets
[3245.54 → 3246.12] way faster
[3246.12 → 3246.60] and all this other
[3246.60 → 3247.04] kind of stuff
[3247.04 → 3248.32] but it will hold
[3248.32 → 3248.88] your Aimer
[3248.88 → 3249.58] on the person.
[3249.72 → 3251.02] Yeah, it's 360
[3251.02 → 3252.96] no scope aim lock.
[3253.10 → 3253.32] Yeah.
[3253.62 → 3253.88] Right?
[3254.08 → 3254.26] Like,
[3254.54 → 3256.80] it's a huge advantage.
[3257.72 → 3258.22] Yeah, so
[3258.22 → 3259.08] after Activision
[3259.08 → 3259.92] announced a new
[3259.92 → 3260.96] hardware pass through
[3260.96 → 3262.02] so that's what it's called.
[3262.36 → 3263.34] A hardware pass through
[3263.34 → 3264.14] detection system
[3264.14 → 3264.84] for Call of Duty
[3264.84 → 3265.58] a few weeks ago
[3265.58 → 3267.22] a large glut
[3267.22 → 3268.24] of these devices
[3268.24 → 3269.70] apparently flooded
[3269.70 → 3270.90] the second hand market.
[3271.28 → 3272.36] This is a cool
[3272.36 → 3273.12] um
[3273.12 → 3275.98] maybe unintentional
[3275.98 → 3277.06] positive side effect
[3277.06 → 3277.52] of like
[3277.52 → 3278.62] dacha mechanics
[3278.62 → 3280.14] is that it
[3280.14 → 3281.80] actually punishes people
[3281.80 → 3282.32] for cheating
[3282.32 → 3283.06] because
[3283.06 → 3284.24] when you lose
[3284.24 → 3284.90] your account
[3284.90 → 3285.30] Yeah.
[3285.58 → 3286.64] you actually lose
[3286.64 → 3287.46] in game items
[3287.46 → 3287.90] that have your
[3287.90 → 3288.52] what real value?
[3288.60 → 3288.78] Anyway,
[3288.86 → 3289.36] this is very
[3289.36 → 3290.68] very much a side discussion.
[3290.96 → 3291.68] I still wish
[3291.68 → 3292.44] we'd go back to
[3292.44 → 3293.12] you buy the game
[3293.12 → 3293.94] and just have the game
[3293.94 → 3294.08] but
[3294.08 → 3294.90] As far as my understanding
[3294.90 → 3295.18] goes
[3295.18 → 3295.70] a lot of them
[3295.70 → 3296.30] just don't care
[3296.30 → 3296.96] and they'll just
[3296.96 → 3297.70] buy the skins again.
[3298.38 → 3299.20] I mean, okay.
[3299.38 → 3299.70] Because like
[3299.70 → 3300.72] the Markov people
[3300.72 → 3301.18] that cheat
[3301.18 → 3302.76] a huge percentage
[3302.76 → 3302.96] of them
[3302.96 → 3303.92] buy the most expensive
[3303.92 → 3304.72] possible version
[3304.72 → 3305.08] of the game
[3305.08 → 3305.52] which is like
[3305.52 → 3306.38] over two times
[3306.38 → 3307.16] the normal price
[3307.16 → 3308.80] and just has like
[3308.80 → 3309.32] more like
[3309.32 → 3310.08] inventory space
[3310.08 → 3310.46] and stuff.
[3311.06 → 3311.88] Because they just don't
[3311.88 → 3312.26] they're paying
[3312.26 → 3313.04] for the cheat too
[3313.04 → 3313.50] they just
[3313.50 → 3314.24] money is
[3314.24 → 3315.04] they're whales, right?
[3315.34 → 3316.10] I always sit down
[3316.10 → 3316.68] with my kids
[3316.68 → 3317.22] and I'm like
[3317.22 → 3317.66] okay
[3317.66 → 3318.74] is that real?
[3319.54 → 3319.90] No.
[3320.38 → 3321.38] Do we pay for that?
[3321.78 → 3322.18] No.
[3322.88 → 3323.22] Alright.
[3323.44 → 3323.62] Good.
[3324.66 → 3325.84] We can continue.
[3326.32 → 3326.60] Now,
[3326.78 → 3327.98] an obvious solution
[3327.98 → 3328.72] to these issues
[3328.72 → 3329.54] would simply be
[3329.54 → 3330.42] to ban
[3330.42 → 3331.20] all
[3331.20 → 3333.02] pass-through devices.
[3333.58 → 3334.00] However,
[3334.38 → 3335.32] and that's why
[3335.32 → 3336.06] this is here,
[3336.58 → 3336.80] Yeah.
[3336.80 → 3338.90] you would also
[3338.90 → 3340.06] be catching
[3340.06 → 3341.42] folks who rely
[3341.42 → 3342.28] on things
[3342.28 → 3343.20] like the adaptive
[3343.20 → 3343.76] controller
[3343.76 → 3345.18] in the Crossfire.
[3345.32 → 3345.46] And the adaptive
[3345.46 → 3346.10] controller is
[3346.10 → 3348.14] insanely powerful.
[3348.42 → 3348.94] This is actually
[3348.94 → 3349.48] like one of the
[3349.48 → 3350.14] the coolest devices
[3350.14 → 3350.76] that is released
[3350.76 → 3351.50] in a really long time.
[3351.62 → 3352.40] Because if you see
[3352.40 → 3352.90] all these little
[3352.90 → 3353.78] like kind of
[3353.78 → 3355.32] dots at the top
[3355.32 → 3356.36] those are all
[3356.36 → 3357.32] extensible
[3357.32 → 3358.60] things.
[3358.86 → 3359.12] Like I think
[3359.12 → 3359.50] it's in here
[3359.50 → 3359.94] we can take it
[3359.94 → 3360.38] out if we wanted.
[3360.60 → 3361.36] But there's a
[3361.36 → 3362.60] huge rack of
[3362.60 → 3363.58] plugs on the back
[3363.58 → 3364.58] that you can plug
[3364.58 → 3365.62] more things
[3365.62 → 3366.50] into the adaptable
[3366.50 → 3366.98] controller.
[3367.42 → 3368.46] I had a friend
[3368.46 → 3369.56] recently who
[3369.56 → 3371.46] I think they
[3371.46 → 3371.72] like
[3371.72 → 3372.32] Yeah,
[3372.38 → 3372.82] so basically
[3372.82 → 3374.50] every function
[3374.50 → 3375.42] of the controller
[3375.42 → 3377.42] has its own
[3377.42 → 3378.18] three and a half
[3378.18 → 3379.14] millimetre jack
[3379.14 → 3380.24] that can be used
[3380.24 → 3380.94] to plug in
[3380.94 → 3382.46] some kind
[3382.46 → 3384.08] of device
[3384.08 → 3384.88] that is
[3384.88 → 3387.54] more usable
[3387.54 → 3387.98] to
[3387.98 → 3389.72] So if your
[3389.72 → 3390.96] arm is like
[3390.96 → 3391.52] locked to your
[3391.52 → 3392.10] side for some
[3392.10 → 3392.40] reason
[3392.40 → 3393.88] you could have
[3393.88 → 3394.40] a joystick
[3394.40 → 3395.18] that presses up
[3395.18 → 3395.84] into your palm
[3395.84 → 3396.50] and you move
[3396.50 → 3397.08] it around like
[3397.08 → 3397.90] this using
[3397.90 → 3398.94] your whole palm
[3398.94 → 3399.60] instead of
[3399.60 → 3400.18] just your thumb.
[3400.30 → 3400.34] Yeah,
[3400.36 → 3400.84] the joystick
[3400.84 → 3401.56] connectors are
[3401.56 → 3402.26] USB and
[3402.26 → 3402.72] they're on the
[3402.72 → 3403.08] side.
[3403.48 → 3404.10] You could have
[3404.10 → 3404.88] a button
[3404.88 → 3405.38] that's near
[3405.38 → 3405.76] your head
[3405.76 → 3406.08] and if you
[3406.08 → 3406.68] have mobility
[3406.68 → 3407.34] in your neck
[3407.34 → 3408.04] so you could
[3408.04 → 3408.82] like lean
[3408.82 → 3409.44] into it
[3409.44 → 3410.14] you could
[3410.14 → 3410.74] press a button
[3410.74 → 3411.38] using your head.
[3411.70 → 3412.14] I had a buddy
[3412.14 → 3413.00] recently who
[3413.00 → 3414.22] severely damaged
[3414.22 → 3414.96] one of their wrists
[3414.96 → 3416.06] and I had suggested
[3416.06 → 3416.62] that they use
[3416.62 → 3417.16] one of these
[3417.16 → 3418.44] in order to
[3418.44 → 3419.46] gain input
[3419.46 → 3420.40] into a game
[3420.40 → 3420.84] that they could
[3420.84 → 3421.54] use while having
[3421.54 → 3422.42] their hand in a cast.
[3422.78 → 3423.42] These things
[3423.42 → 3424.56] are actually
[3424.56 → 3425.70] amazing.
[3425.94 → 3426.52] And essential.
[3426.76 → 3427.08] Yes.
[3427.88 → 3429.54] So I was so
[3429.54 → 3430.46] proud of Microsoft
[3430.46 → 3431.04] when they released
[3431.04 → 3431.48] that and I still
[3431.48 → 3431.88] think that's
[3431.88 → 3432.60] extremely cool
[3432.60 → 3432.90] that they're
[3432.90 → 3433.46] supporting it.
[3433.80 → 3434.96] And so if we
[3434.96 → 3435.76] were to ban
[3435.76 → 3437.68] pass-through devices
[3437.68 → 3438.82] it would be
[3438.82 → 3439.60] really hard to
[3439.60 → 3440.36] tell the difference
[3440.36 → 3441.98] between a bad
[3441.98 → 3442.78] pass-through device
[3442.78 → 3443.56] for cheaters
[3443.56 → 3444.80] and a pass-through
[3444.80 → 3445.46] device for people
[3445.46 → 3446.06] who just want to
[3446.06 → 3446.80] play the game.
[3447.52 → 3447.64] Yeah.
[3448.08 → 3448.92] Bungee in particular
[3448.92 → 3449.54] has emphasized
[3449.54 → 3450.22] they're focused
[3450.22 → 3450.90] on players who
[3450.90 → 3451.66] use these devices
[3451.66 → 3452.68] to gain an unfair
[3452.68 → 3453.62] competitive advantage
[3453.62 → 3455.20] and has explicitly
[3455.20 → 3456.82] reassured players
[3456.82 → 3457.40] who require
[3457.40 → 3458.00] adaptive tools
[3458.00 → 3458.54] to participate
[3458.54 → 3459.58] that they will
[3459.58 → 3461.52] not be banned.
[3461.72 → 3462.90] I mean I'd be
[3462.90 → 3463.92] surprised if the
[3463.92 → 3464.92] odd...
[3464.92 → 3465.84] Get accidentals.
[3465.94 → 3466.14] Yeah.
[3466.46 → 3467.16] There's going to be
[3467.16 → 3467.74] there's probably
[3467.74 → 3468.56] going to be some
[3468.56 → 3469.56] collateral damage here
[3469.56 → 3470.70] but hopefully
[3470.70 → 3472.46] we can avoid
[3472.46 → 3473.10] too much of that
[3473.10 → 3473.72] because that is
[3473.72 → 3474.64] the last thing
[3474.64 → 3475.44] that people who
[3475.44 → 3476.06] rely on their
[3476.06 → 3476.88] adaptive controller
[3476.88 → 3477.44] to play
[3477.44 → 3478.40] need to deal with.
[3478.58 → 3478.60] Yes.
[3478.70 → 3479.08] Agreed.
[3479.28 → 3480.32] In addition to
[3480.32 → 3481.16] device detection
[3481.16 → 3482.22] the Bungee security
[3482.22 → 3482.76] team will be
[3482.76 → 3483.52] monitoring gameplay
[3483.52 → 3484.28] for unusual
[3484.28 → 3484.84] patterns of
[3484.84 → 3485.36] player behaviour
[3485.36 → 3485.90] to indicate
[3485.90 → 3486.24] cheating.
[3486.74 → 3487.58] However it is
[3487.58 → 3488.14] still possible
[3488.14 → 3488.72] and even likely
[3488.72 → 3489.06] that these
[3489.06 → 3489.62] systems will
[3489.62 → 3491.08] sometimes flag
[3491.08 → 3491.64] players with a
[3491.64 → 3492.40] legitimate need.
[3493.86 → 3494.38] Discussion
[3494.38 → 3495.12] question here.
[3495.66 → 3496.54] Bungee specifically
[3496.54 → 3497.48] defines cheating
[3497.48 → 3498.36] as using an
[3498.36 → 3499.42] outside tool to
[3499.42 → 3500.00] change the
[3500.00 → 3501.14] intended experience
[3501.14 → 3501.76] of the game
[3501.76 → 3502.80] in this case by
[3502.80 → 3503.44] removing a
[3503.44 → 3503.82] challenge.
[3504.04 → 3504.98] Is this a good
[3504.98 → 3505.60] understanding of
[3505.60 → 3506.24] cheating and how
[3506.24 → 3506.88] would you define
[3506.88 → 3507.04] it?
[3507.94 → 3508.62] See I wouldn't
[3508.62 → 3509.84] just say changing
[3509.84 → 3510.50] the intended
[3510.50 → 3511.30] experience of a
[3511.30 → 3511.52] game.
[3511.72 → 3512.14] I would say
[3512.14 → 3512.78] changing the
[3512.78 → 3513.58] intended experience
[3513.58 → 3514.26] of the game
[3514.26 → 3514.98] for another
[3514.98 → 3515.44] player.
[3516.06 → 3516.88] Because changing
[3516.88 → 3517.36] the intended
[3517.36 → 3518.02] experience of the
[3518.02 → 3518.92] game for myself
[3518.92 → 3520.16] is modding.
[3521.26 → 3521.88] Changing the
[3521.88 → 3522.38] experience for
[3522.38 → 3523.22] someone else
[3523.22 → 3525.16] is screwing
[3525.16 → 3525.58] them over.
[3526.28 → 3526.84] And you know
[3526.84 → 3527.64] what I had wanted
[3527.64 → 3528.16] to talk about
[3528.16 → 3528.92] this actually when
[3528.92 → 3529.54] we were discussing
[3529.54 → 3530.60] the Gary Bowser
[3530.60 → 3532.84] verdict where I
[3532.84 → 3533.82] basically was
[3533.82 → 3534.30] going to say
[3534.30 → 3535.48] like time equals
[3535.48 → 3535.84] money.
[3535.84 → 3535.88] money.
[3536.52 → 3537.54] And in a
[3537.54 → 3538.54] sense that
[3538.54 → 3539.34] 14 and a
[3539.34 → 3539.92] half million
[3539.92 → 3540.64] dollar sentence
[3540.64 → 3542.62] is basically
[3542.62 → 3543.24] like handing
[3543.24 → 3544.00] down multiple
[3544.00 → 3544.88] lifetime sentences
[3544.88 → 3546.08] if that's all
[3546.08 → 3546.76] that this person
[3546.76 → 3547.56] could ever earn.
[3547.76 → 3548.24] You kind of get
[3548.24 → 3548.58] what I mean?
[3548.70 → 3549.58] And so to me
[3549.58 → 3550.40] it's the
[3550.40 → 3551.38] proportionality of
[3551.38 → 3551.80] the sentence
[3551.80 → 3552.90] that just makes
[3552.90 → 3553.96] absolutely no
[3553.96 → 3554.52] sense here.
[3554.52 → 3554.74] Yeah.
[3555.28 → 3556.12] So in this
[3556.12 → 3557.26] same way
[3557.26 → 3558.78] you know the
[3558.78 → 3559.32] way that I
[3559.32 → 3560.10] define
[3560.10 → 3562.78] wrong
[3562.78 → 3565.10] is in the
[3565.10 → 3565.78] way that
[3565.78 → 3567.02] it affects
[3567.02 → 3567.82] someone else.
[3567.94 → 3568.68] Now obviously
[3568.68 → 3569.36] there are
[3569.36 → 3570.10] limitations.
[3570.54 → 3571.26] If someone
[3571.26 → 3572.06] were to
[3572.06 → 3573.16] you know
[3573.16 → 3573.82] follow me
[3573.82 → 3574.30] around
[3574.30 → 3575.58] and just
[3575.58 → 3576.00] sit there
[3576.00 → 3576.58] being upset
[3576.58 → 3577.10] and offended
[3577.10 → 3577.76] every time I
[3577.76 → 3578.26] used the
[3578.26 → 3578.90] word the
[3578.90 → 3580.16] I would
[3580.16 → 3580.90] kind of go
[3580.90 → 3582.04] well then
[3582.04 → 3582.44] leave.
[3583.24 → 3583.64] Goodbye.
[3584.08 → 3584.44] Also
[3584.44 → 3586.12] enjoy life
[3586.12 → 3586.56] as someone
[3586.56 → 3587.02] who's just
[3587.02 → 3587.62] perpetually
[3587.62 → 3588.18] offended by
[3588.18 → 3588.80] everything.
[3590.28 → 3590.88] Bye.
[3591.92 → 3592.40] He never
[3592.40 → 3592.82] said the
[3592.82 → 3593.06] in that
[3593.06 → 3593.38] sentence.
[3593.74 → 3594.20] Yeah I
[3594.20 → 3594.64] was careful.
[3595.34 → 3595.76] Respectful.
[3595.78 → 3596.16] Very good.
[3596.26 → 3596.58] Wasn't on
[3596.58 → 3596.86] purpose.
[3598.38 → 3599.28] I was trying
[3599.28 → 3599.84] to catch you.
[3599.94 → 3600.44] But in this
[3600.44 → 3601.12] case there is
[3601.12 → 3601.82] a reasonable
[3601.82 → 3602.48] expectation
[3602.48 → 3603.24] from that
[3603.24 → 3603.82] other player
[3603.82 → 3604.24] that they
[3604.24 → 3604.62] should be
[3604.62 → 3604.98] able to
[3604.98 → 3605.32] play the
[3605.32 → 3605.64] game
[3605.64 → 3605.92] without
[3605.92 → 3606.36] somebody
[3606.36 → 3607.00] impeding
[3607.00 → 3607.36] them in
[3607.36 → 3607.64] a way
[3607.64 → 3608.14] that was
[3608.14 → 3608.40] not
[3608.40 → 3608.94] expected
[3608.94 → 3609.60] nor
[3609.60 → 3610.14] intended
[3610.14 → 3610.52] by the
[3610.52 → 3610.70] game
[3610.70 → 3611.18] developer.
[3611.68 → 3612.16] So in
[3612.16 → 3612.44] our
[3612.44 → 3613.22] mutually
[3613.22 → 3614.02] understood
[3614.02 → 3616.06] definition
[3616.06 → 3616.68] of what
[3616.68 → 3617.28] this experience
[3617.28 → 3617.72] is supposed
[3617.72 → 3618.08] to be
[3618.08 → 3618.28] you're
[3618.28 → 3618.62] affecting
[3618.62 → 3619.04] not only
[3619.04 → 3619.44] your own
[3619.44 → 3619.76] but you're
[3619.76 → 3620.06] affecting
[3620.06 → 3620.80] someone else's
[3620.80 → 3621.78] and in
[3621.78 → 3621.96] a way
[3621.96 → 3622.24] that is
[3622.24 → 3622.80] detrimental.
[3623.18 → 3624.08] That is the
[3624.08 → 3624.60] definition of
[3624.60 → 3625.30] cheating to
[3625.30 → 3625.52] me.
[3625.74 → 3626.30] It's clearly
[3626.30 → 3627.04] trying to
[3627.04 → 3627.68] break rules
[3627.68 → 3628.72] because like
[3628.72 → 3629.46] with the
[3629.46 → 3630.06] keyboard
[3630.06 → 3630.70] mask as a
[3630.70 → 3631.32] controller thing
[3631.32 → 3631.56] that we're
[3631.56 → 3632.12] talking about
[3632.12 → 3632.92] you can play
[3632.92 → 3633.22] with a
[3633.22 → 3634.08] controller or
[3634.08 → 3634.58] you can play
[3634.58 → 3634.84] with a
[3634.84 → 3635.18] keyboard.
[3635.62 → 3635.94] You're
[3635.94 → 3637.02] screwing with
[3637.02 → 3637.52] things to
[3637.52 → 3638.04] make it think
[3638.04 → 3638.32] that you're
[3638.32 → 3638.70] doing something
[3638.70 → 3638.98] that you're
[3638.98 → 3639.20] not.
[3639.74 → 3640.36] So there's
[3640.36 → 3641.18] clear intention
[3641.18 → 3641.50] here.
[3641.58 → 3641.82] Yeah I
[3641.82 → 3642.16] think the
[3642.16 → 3642.80] intent is
[3642.80 → 3643.14] another
[3643.14 → 3643.96] really
[3643.96 → 3645.76] I think
[3645.76 → 3646.50] the intent
[3646.50 → 3647.22] is important
[3647.22 → 3647.66] even if
[3647.66 → 3647.88] it's
[3647.88 → 3648.22] difficult
[3648.22 → 3648.96] to prove.
[3649.90 → 3650.86] Either way
[3650.86 → 3651.36] I mean
[3651.36 → 3652.44] I'm
[3652.44 → 3653.62] generally
[3653.62 → 3654.16] pretty
[3654.16 → 3654.62] receptive
[3654.62 → 3655.30] to anything
[3655.30 → 3655.96] that
[3655.96 → 3657.32] makes the
[3657.32 → 3658.08] gaming
[3658.08 → 3659.22] playing field
[3659.22 → 3659.96] more level
[3659.96 → 3660.68] and that
[3660.68 → 3661.50] rewards people
[3661.50 → 3662.08] who play the
[3662.08 → 3662.82] game properly
[3662.82 → 3663.70] and punishes
[3663.70 → 3664.04] cheaters.
[3665.18 → 3666.22] In this case
[3666.22 → 3667.00] all I hope
[3667.00 → 3667.42] is that we
[3667.42 → 3667.86] don't see
[3667.86 → 3668.28] too many
[3668.28 → 3669.18] innocent users
[3669.18 → 3670.70] caught in
[3670.70 → 3671.80] the crossfire.
[3672.38 → 3673.28] Should we talk
[3673.28 → 3673.62] about the
[3673.62 → 3674.16] big Seagate
[3674.16 → 3674.42] ban?
[3674.62 → 3674.92] Yeah.
[3675.14 → 3675.80] Or rather
[3675.80 → 3676.86] the fine
[3676.86 → 3677.80] for violating
[3677.80 → 3678.26] an export
[3678.26 → 3678.52] ban.
[3678.64 → 3678.94] I feel like
[3678.94 → 3679.30] I've done
[3679.30 → 3679.84] all the topics
[3679.84 → 3680.36] up till now.
[3680.50 → 3680.78] Seagate
[3680.78 → 3681.24] Technology
[3681.24 → 3681.78] Holdings
[3681.78 → 3682.36] has admitted
[3682.36 → 3683.42] to wrongdoing
[3683.42 → 3683.98] and agreed
[3683.98 → 3684.40] to pay
[3684.40 → 3688.02] a $300
[3688.02 → 3688.48] million
[3688.48 → 3689.42] fine to
[3689.42 → 3689.64] settle
[3689.64 → 3690.16] allegations
[3690.16 → 3690.52] that it
[3690.52 → 3690.78] sold
[3690.78 → 3692.56] 7.4
[3692.56 → 3693.50] million
[3693.50 → 3694.26] hard disks
[3694.26 → 3694.98] to Huawei
[3694.98 → 3695.80] violating
[3695.80 → 3696.56] a 2020
[3696.56 → 3697.46] export ban.
[3697.82 → 3698.14] This is
[3698.14 → 3698.80] the largest
[3698.80 → 3699.54] single
[3699.54 → 3700.16] administrative
[3700.16 → 3700.64] penalty
[3700.64 → 3701.66] ever levied
[3701.66 → 3702.14] by the
[3702.14 → 3702.42] U.S.
[3702.50 → 3702.74] Commerce
[3702.74 → 3703.26] Department's
[3703.26 → 3703.76] Bureau of
[3703.76 → 3704.24] Industry
[3704.24 → 3704.92] and Security
[3704.92 → 3705.80] and it
[3705.80 → 3706.68] is meant
[3706.68 → 3707.52] to represent
[3707.52 → 3708.30] double the
[3708.30 → 3708.72] estimated
[3708.72 → 3709.64] profit Seagate
[3709.64 → 3710.38] accrued
[3710.38 → 3711.02] from the
[3711.02 → 3711.72] illicit sales.
[3712.18 → 3712.54] Seagate's
[3712.54 → 3713.22] annual net
[3713.22 → 3713.82] income for
[3713.82 → 3714.36] 2022
[3714.36 → 3716.54] was $1.6
[3716.54 → 3717.10] billion
[3717.10 → 3717.62] and their
[3717.62 → 3717.92] estimated
[3717.92 → 3718.52] profit from
[3718.52 → 3719.42] sales was
[3719.42 → 3720.70] a period
[3720.70 → 3721.34] because we
[3721.34 → 3721.72] don't have
[3721.72 → 3722.18] that note.
[3722.62 → 3723.14] I'm not
[3723.14 → 3723.94] sure what
[3723.94 → 3724.46] happened there.
[3725.36 → 3725.98] But you
[3725.98 → 3726.14] know
[3726.14 → 3726.48] probably
[3726.48 → 3727.46] $150
[3727.46 → 3727.92] million
[3727.92 → 3728.52] based on
[3728.52 → 3729.06] that the
[3729.06 → 3729.38] settlement
[3729.38 → 3730.00] was meant
[3730.00 → 3730.28] to be
[3730.28 → 3730.98] double the
[3730.98 → 3731.38] expected
[3731.38 → 3731.82] profits.
[3732.12 → 3732.60] So we
[3732.60 → 3733.88] can solve
[3733.88 → 3734.38] for X
[3734.38 → 3734.56] here.
[3734.64 → 3735.04] Let's go.
[3735.20 → 3735.32] Yeah,
[3735.36 → 3735.54] yeah,
[3735.54 → 3735.98] very good.
[3736.34 → 3737.06] Some background
[3737.06 → 3737.56] information.
[3737.72 → 3738.12] In August
[3738.12 → 3739.28] of 2020,
[3739.82 → 3740.50] the U.S.
[3740.56 → 3740.78] Commerce
[3740.78 → 3741.12] Department
[3741.12 → 3742.32] expanded export
[3742.32 → 3742.84] restrictions
[3742.84 → 3743.68] against Huawei
[3743.68 → 3744.52] after they
[3744.52 → 3745.72] allegedly tried
[3745.72 → 3747.20] to obtain
[3747.20 → 3747.66] advanced
[3747.66 → 3748.42] technologies to
[3748.42 → 3749.06] undermine U.S.
[3749.12 → 3749.86] national security.
[3750.26 → 3750.92] While Huawei's
[3750.92 → 3751.84] two other primary
[3751.84 → 3752.76] suppliers stopped
[3752.76 → 3753.30] shipments,
[3753.76 → 3754.48] Seagate continued
[3754.48 → 3755.50] sales for 11
[3755.50 → 3756.20] months as
[3756.20 → 3756.90] Huawei's sole
[3756.90 → 3757.36] supplier.
[3757.90 → 3758.58] Seagate even
[3758.58 → 3759.56] extended multiple
[3759.56 → 3760.30] lines of credit
[3760.30 → 3761.42] worth $1 billion
[3761.42 → 3762.96] to Huawei to
[3762.96 → 3763.42] help them
[3763.42 → 3764.22] purchase more
[3764.22 → 3764.82] hard drives.
[3765.18 → 3765.64] And to be
[3765.64 → 3766.00] clear,
[3766.28 → 3768.70] everyone knew
[3768.70 → 3769.70] that this
[3769.70 → 3770.64] export ban
[3770.64 → 3771.04] was going
[3771.04 → 3771.36] on.
[3772.08 → 3772.18] Oh,
[3772.24 → 3772.38] yeah.
[3772.76 → 3773.54] It was like
[3773.54 → 3774.42] the biggest
[3774.42 → 3774.84] news.
[3774.84 → 3775.14] news.
[3775.40 → 3775.62] Yeah.
[3775.96 → 3776.20] Yeah.
[3776.28 → 3776.68] We talked
[3776.68 → 3777.00] about it on
[3777.00 → 3777.52] WAN Show.
[3778.16 → 3779.18] That's even
[3779.18 → 3779.84] like probably
[3779.84 → 3780.30] one of the
[3780.30 → 3781.06] smaller ones
[3781.06 → 3781.42] talking about
[3781.42 → 3781.90] like every
[3781.90 → 3782.46] news agency.
[3782.76 → 3783.94] They 100%
[3783.94 → 3784.24] knew what
[3784.24 → 3784.44] they were
[3784.44 → 3784.64] doing.
[3785.72 → 3786.46] So here's
[3786.46 → 3786.86] what I want
[3786.86 → 3787.10] to know.
[3787.58 → 3788.24] On the one
[3788.24 → 3788.56] hand,
[3788.70 → 3789.24] I think you
[3789.24 → 3789.52] and I
[3789.52 → 3790.36] probably both
[3790.36 → 3791.40] agree that
[3791.40 → 3793.08] if a corporation
[3793.08 → 3794.04] breaks the law,
[3794.28 → 3795.08] the fine should
[3795.08 → 3797.00] be such that
[3797.00 → 3798.12] it really isn't
[3798.12 → 3798.66] worth it to
[3798.66 → 3799.28] break that law
[3799.28 → 3799.56] again.
[3799.80 → 3799.98] Yeah.
[3800.06 → 3800.56] And I think
[3800.56 → 3801.06] we would
[3801.06 → 3802.06] probably agree
[3802.06 → 3803.12] that this is
[3803.12 → 3804.34] positive in that
[3804.34 → 3804.66] sense.
[3805.48 → 3806.46] But here's my
[3806.46 → 3807.38] problem with it
[3807.38 → 3808.46] is that
[3808.46 → 3810.28] it's
[3810.28 → 3812.72] it sort of
[3812.72 → 3813.62] comes across
[3813.62 → 3814.34] maybe not
[3814.34 → 3815.14] hypocritical,
[3815.36 → 3815.60] but
[3815.60 → 3817.02] I guess
[3817.02 → 3817.60] the cynic
[3817.60 → 3817.92] in me
[3817.92 → 3818.32] looks at
[3818.32 → 3818.64] this and
[3818.64 → 3818.98] goes,
[3819.32 → 3819.50] huh,
[3819.96 → 3820.58] so it
[3820.58 → 3821.12] turns out
[3821.12 → 3821.76] that you
[3821.76 → 3822.50] do know
[3822.50 → 3823.22] how to
[3823.22 → 3823.78] properly
[3823.78 → 3824.42] punish this
[3824.42 → 3824.72] sort of
[3824.72 → 3825.10] behaviour
[3825.10 → 3825.86] when you
[3825.86 → 3826.82] actually care.
[3827.22 → 3827.98] But when
[3827.98 → 3828.72] the transgression
[3828.72 → 3829.62] is against
[3829.62 → 3830.70] the individual
[3830.70 → 3831.38] user,
[3832.14 → 3832.38] it's like,
[3832.50 → 3832.60] eh,
[3833.68 → 3834.20] I don't know,
[3834.26 → 3835.38] $4 per user,
[3835.72 → 3835.94] you know,
[3836.02 → 3836.58] class action,
[3836.72 → 3836.96] whatever,
[3837.36 → 3838.02] actually most of
[3838.02 → 3838.40] it just goes
[3838.40 → 3839.00] to the lawyers.
[3839.24 → 3839.84] This seems
[3839.84 → 3840.42] like a good
[3840.42 → 3840.90] system.
[3842.00 → 3842.18] Yeah.
[3842.18 → 3844.34] where is
[3844.34 → 3845.18] this justice
[3845.18 → 3846.60] for individual
[3846.60 → 3847.16] users,
[3847.26 → 3848.00] particularly when
[3848.00 → 3848.94] it comes to
[3848.94 → 3850.18] data privacy
[3850.18 → 3851.38] or when it
[3851.38 → 3851.98] comes to
[3851.98 → 3852.66] other rights
[3852.66 → 3853.30] violations?
[3853.82 → 3853.98] You know,
[3854.02 → 3854.66] how is it
[3854.66 → 3855.18] that, you
[3855.18 → 3855.28] know,
[3855.28 → 3855.90] someone like
[3855.90 → 3857.04] a TransUnion,
[3857.38 → 3857.66] man,
[3857.74 → 3858.16] I remember
[3858.16 → 3858.94] being so
[3858.94 → 3859.44] mad,
[3859.74 → 3860.46] TransUnion's
[3860.46 → 3861.10] own website,
[3861.18 → 3861.54] back when I
[3861.54 → 3861.98] had to sign
[3861.98 → 3862.40] up for it
[3862.40 → 3862.78] for credit
[3862.78 → 3863.20] monitoring,
[3863.32 → 3863.70] because
[3863.70 → 3864.50] something,
[3864.66 → 3865.00] something,
[3865.24 → 3865.92] my insurance
[3865.92 → 3866.46] wouldn't cover
[3866.46 → 3867.24] me unless I
[3867.24 → 3867.64] had credit
[3867.64 → 3868.06] monitoring,
[3868.24 → 3868.46] something,
[3868.60 → 3868.82] something,
[3868.82 → 3869.22] and it
[3869.22 → 3869.58] doesn't matter.
[3869.66 → 3869.86] The point
[3869.86 → 3870.06] is I
[3870.06 → 3870.38] had to
[3870.38 → 3871.12] have this
[3871.12 → 3872.02] stupid service
[3872.02 → 3872.32] that I
[3872.32 → 3872.72] signed up
[3872.72 → 3873.06] for
[3873.06 → 3873.26] credit
[3873.26 → 3873.66] monitoring
[3873.66 → 3874.12] because of
[3874.12 → 3874.40] some
[3874.40 → 3875.24] identity
[3875.24 → 3876.14] something
[3876.14 → 3876.56] incident
[3876.56 → 3876.96] that took
[3876.96 → 3877.34] place,
[3877.50 → 3878.86] and TransUnion's
[3878.86 → 3880.16] own website
[3880.16 → 3881.66] had a
[3881.70 → 3882.46] like a
[3882.46 → 3883.32] a help
[3883.32 → 3884.56] article talking
[3884.56 → 3884.94] about the
[3884.94 → 3885.54] importance of
[3885.54 → 3886.16] two-factor,
[3886.36 → 3886.90] and at the
[3886.90 → 3887.28] time,
[3887.62 → 3888.42] TransUnion's
[3888.42 → 3889.48] own accounts
[3889.48 → 3890.44] didn't support
[3890.44 → 3891.06] two-factor.
[3891.40 → 3891.98] I pointed
[3891.98 → 3892.62] this out to
[3892.62 → 3893.02] the rep,
[3893.06 → 3893.26] and they're
[3893.26 → 3893.68] just like,
[3893.88 → 3894.08] hmm.
[3896.66 → 3897.34] And how
[3897.34 → 3897.56] many,
[3897.56 → 3898.00] how many
[3898.00 → 3898.44] breaches
[3898.44 → 3898.88] have they
[3898.88 → 3899.26] suffered?
[3900.66 → 3901.26] I know
[3901.26 → 3901.78] of at least
[3901.78 → 3902.08] one,
[3902.18 → 3902.30] yeah.
[3902.44 → 3903.00] And we're
[3903.00 → 3903.54] not talking
[3903.54 → 3904.22] breaches of
[3904.22 → 3905.12] trivial things,
[3905.20 → 3905.42] right?
[3905.56 → 3905.80] Like,
[3905.86 → 3906.16] you know,
[3906.62 → 3907.02] oh man,
[3907.14 → 3907.96] nothing's
[3907.96 → 3908.32] trivial.
[3908.82 → 3909.30] Nothing's
[3909.30 → 3909.78] trivial when
[3909.78 → 3910.46] it comes to
[3910.46 → 3911.26] personal data,
[3911.30 → 3911.54] but we're
[3911.54 → 3911.98] talking,
[3912.08 → 3912.54] you know,
[3912.66 → 3913.20] SIN numbers,
[3913.30 → 3913.68] which are
[3913.68 → 3914.22] our equivalent
[3914.22 → 3915.10] of an SSN,
[3915.18 → 3915.32] right?
[3915.36 → 3915.68] A social
[3915.68 → 3916.44] security number.
[3916.90 → 3917.22] These are
[3917.22 → 3917.70] things that,
[3918.08 → 3918.74] while technically
[3918.74 → 3919.78] can be changed,
[3920.12 → 3921.04] are a royal
[3921.04 → 3921.62] pain in the
[3921.62 → 3922.40] butt to change,
[3922.90 → 3924.14] and can be
[3924.14 → 3925.62] extremely beneficial
[3925.62 → 3926.48] to né'er-do-wells,
[3926.52 → 3926.68] right?
[3926.74 → 3926.90] Like,
[3926.90 → 3927.24] there's,
[3927.24 → 3927.96] there's database
[3927.96 → 3928.62] is out there
[3928.62 → 3929.02] that are gonna
[3929.02 → 3929.86] have basically
[3929.86 → 3931.26] every piece of
[3931.26 → 3932.08] information that
[3932.08 → 3932.66] you could ever
[3932.66 → 3933.12] want to keep
[3933.12 → 3933.70] out of people's
[3933.70 → 3934.00] hands,
[3935.12 → 3935.82] pretty much
[3935.82 → 3936.32] across the
[3936.32 → 3936.82] board at this
[3936.82 → 3937.00] point,
[3937.08 → 3937.92] because nobody
[3937.92 → 3938.50] is actually
[3938.50 → 3939.14] punishing this
[3939.14 → 3940.14] stuff in a way
[3940.14 → 3940.92] that is meaningful
[3940.92 → 3942.08] and forces them
[3942.08 → 3942.56] to take data
[3942.56 → 3943.36] security seriously.
[3943.68 → 3943.86] I mean,
[3943.90 → 3944.36] we went through,
[3944.46 → 3944.92] this was an
[3944.92 → 3945.20] interesting
[3945.20 → 3945.80] conversation,
[3946.14 → 3946.86] I was complaining
[3946.86 → 3947.46] to Luke about
[3947.46 → 3947.88] how our new
[3947.88 → 3948.54] password manager
[3948.54 → 3949.12] takes a long
[3949.12 → 3949.74] time to open,
[3950.14 → 3950.54] and he was
[3950.54 → 3950.80] like,
[3951.48 → 3952.26] well,
[3952.26 → 3953.26] let me tell
[3953.26 → 3953.68] you about
[3953.68 → 3954.00] that.
[3954.36 → 3955.06] That's because
[3955.06 → 3955.52] they are
[3955.52 → 3956.74] actually decrypting
[3956.74 → 3956.92] it.
[3957.20 → 3958.02] The reason
[3958.02 → 3958.48] our old
[3958.48 → 3959.16] password manager
[3959.16 → 3960.08] was so fast
[3960.08 → 3962.16] was because
[3962.16 → 3962.66] it wasn't
[3962.66 → 3963.28] being stored
[3963.28 → 3964.08] at all times
[3964.08 → 3965.20] in an encrypted
[3965.20 → 3965.74] manner.
[3966.28 → 3966.74] And I'm like,
[3967.28 → 3967.70] oh,
[3967.82 → 3968.20] well,
[3968.28 → 3969.24] that's freaking
[3969.24 → 3970.28] amazing then!
[3970.42 → 3970.56] Yeah,
[3970.68 → 3971.22] the usability
[3971.22 → 3972.30] of the stuff
[3972.30 → 3972.96] we're using now
[3972.96 → 3974.42] is genuinely
[3974.42 → 3975.34] worse in,
[3975.42 → 3975.50] like,
[3975.54 → 3975.92] a lot of
[3975.92 → 3976.06] ways,
[3976.06 → 3976.90] in my opinion.
[3976.90 → 3978.90] So,
[3981.12 → 3981.54] on the one
[3981.54 → 3981.80] hand,
[3981.88 → 3982.12] yeah,
[3982.30 → 3982.92] I'm happy,
[3983.36 → 3983.72] but on the
[3983.72 → 3984.30] other hand,
[3984.64 → 3984.82] no,
[3984.90 → 3985.40] I'm actually
[3985.40 → 3986.50] pretty pissed
[3986.50 → 3986.88] off,
[3986.94 → 3987.16] right?
[3987.30 → 3988.52] Because this
[3988.52 → 3989.34] is just yet
[3989.34 → 3989.92] another double
[3989.92 → 3990.34] standard,
[3990.56 → 3991.58] and I'm just
[3991.58 → 3992.08] kind of tired
[3992.08 → 3992.40] of it.
[3993.74 → 3994.00] So,
[3994.96 → 3995.22] yeah,
[3995.32 → 3995.78] show us you
[3995.78 → 3996.90] actually mean
[3996.90 → 3997.38] business.
[3999.56 → 4000.04] There.
[4001.52 → 4002.00] Dan,
[4002.14 → 4002.52] that just
[4002.52 → 4003.24] still says
[4003.24 → 4003.54] the thing
[4003.54 → 4003.88] we're doing.
[4004.68 → 4005.04] We did
[4005.04 → 4005.24] too.
[4006.90 → 4008.22] Way to go,
[4008.36 → 4008.38] Dan.
[4008.38 → 4008.90] Dan's keeping
[4008.90 → 4009.50] us in line.
[4009.70 → 4010.24] It's supposed
[4010.24 → 4011.00] to be additional
[4011.00 → 4011.54] topics.
[4012.16 → 4012.92] Additional ones.
[4013.32 → 4013.54] Yeah,
[4013.56 → 4014.04] you can do as
[4014.04 → 4014.56] many as you
[4014.56 → 4015.06] want until I
[4015.06 → 4015.40] tell you to
[4015.40 → 4015.70] do something
[4015.70 → 4015.90] else.
[4016.04 → 4016.22] Oh,
[4016.60 → 4017.36] all right.
[4018.04 → 4018.26] Cool.
[4018.68 → 4018.90] Well,
[4019.26 → 4020.04] your average
[4020.04 → 4020.64] consumer
[4020.64 → 4022.46] posted a
[4022.46 → 4023.68] review of
[4023.68 → 4024.28] the LTT
[4024.28 → 4024.88] backpack.
[4026.88 → 4027.36] Tech
[4027.36 → 4027.84] reviewer,
[4027.96 → 4028.50] pack rat,
[4028.92 → 4029.36] and lover
[4029.36 → 4029.72] of big
[4029.72 → 4030.34] backpacks,
[4030.76 → 4031.10] Judder
[4031.10 → 4032.16] Ora reviewed
[4032.16 → 4032.78] the LTT
[4032.78 → 4033.20] backpack.
[4033.36 → 4033.58] He said,
[4033.64 → 4034.02] pros,
[4034.44 → 4035.34] huge capacity,
[4035.92 → 4036.72] highly functional,
[4037.34 → 4037.82] comfortable,
[4038.30 → 4038.76] doesn't cause
[4038.76 → 4039.32] strain after
[4039.32 → 4040.02] long periods
[4040.02 → 4040.58] wearing it,
[4040.88 → 4041.48] well-built,
[4041.62 → 4042.24] great material
[4042.24 → 4042.72] and layout.
[4042.84 → 4043.24] He loves all
[4043.24 → 4043.80] the pockets
[4043.80 → 4044.14] and the
[4044.14 → 4044.60] compartments,
[4044.94 → 4045.56] and anti-theft
[4045.56 → 4046.16] features and
[4046.16 → 4047.00] RFID blocking.
[4047.38 → 4047.80] Cons,
[4048.66 → 4049.40] might not be
[4049.40 → 4050.14] for everyone.
[4050.54 → 4051.00] Sometimes you
[4051.00 → 4051.70] don't need
[4051.70 → 4052.54] big,
[4052.92 → 4054.04] and it can be
[4054.04 → 4054.90] visually plain,
[4055.02 → 4055.84] somewhat boxy,
[4056.06 → 4056.76] a major downside
[4056.76 → 4057.44] for people looking
[4057.44 → 4058.62] for a more
[4058.62 → 4059.30] potentially,
[4059.48 → 4059.88] in their opinion,
[4060.04 → 4060.70] stylish backpack.
[4061.22 → 4062.32] Very loud
[4062.32 → 4063.44] orange inside,
[4063.64 → 4064.20] would prefer
[4064.20 → 4064.70] teal.
[4064.70 → 4067.58] really?
[4069.76 → 4070.16] Oh,
[4070.34 → 4070.66] dang it,
[4070.72 → 4071.06] where's the
[4071.06 → 4071.28] bloody?
[4071.58 → 4072.08] I don't think
[4072.08 → 4072.50] it's teal.
[4072.76 → 4072.98] I mean,
[4073.00 → 4073.56] it's tallish.
[4074.42 → 4075.02] What I'm looking
[4075.02 → 4075.38] at looks like
[4075.38 → 4075.72] black.
[4075.96 → 4076.14] No,
[4076.22 → 4076.26] no,
[4076.26 → 4076.64] look over
[4076.64 → 4077.12] there.
[4077.48 → 4077.78] Oh.
[4077.78 → 4080.20] So he wants
[4080.20 → 4081.00] the luxe bag.
[4081.90 → 4082.30] Anyway,
[4082.64 → 4082.98] carry on.
[4084.02 → 4084.78] Summary quote.
[4085.06 → 4085.64] This is directly
[4085.64 → 4086.04] from him.
[4086.62 → 4087.10] If you're in
[4087.10 → 4087.98] the camp that
[4087.98 → 4088.98] you don't care
[4088.98 → 4089.60] about looks,
[4089.66 → 4090.28] you just want
[4090.28 → 4090.74] it to work
[4090.74 → 4091.08] well,
[4091.52 → 4092.68] you want it
[4092.68 → 4093.42] to do its job
[4093.42 → 4094.06] to the pinnacle
[4094.06 → 4094.80] of how it should
[4094.80 → 4095.28] be done,
[4095.64 → 4096.20] this bag is
[4096.20 → 4097.10] absolutely for you.
[4097.16 → 4097.68] I'm taking that
[4097.68 → 4098.16] as a W.
[4098.28 → 4098.84] Big win.
[4098.98 → 4099.52] I'm taking that
[4099.52 → 4100.06] as a W.
[4100.06 → 4100.50] We take those.
[4102.82 → 4103.82] Judder is a bit
[4103.82 → 4104.50] of a bag head.
[4105.26 → 4105.42] Well,
[4105.54 → 4105.76] that,
[4105.92 → 4106.14] okay,
[4106.22 → 4106.78] that came out
[4106.78 → 4107.04] wrong,
[4107.32 → 4108.06] but I think
[4108.06 → 4108.60] you understand
[4108.60 → 4109.06] what I'm saying.
[4109.54 → 4109.96] I didn't think
[4109.96 → 4110.46] it went that way.
[4110.56 → 4111.76] You bloody bag head.
[4111.94 → 4112.34] Okay,
[4112.44 → 4112.54] no,
[4112.60 → 4113.04] not like that.
[4113.10 → 4113.58] Is that a thing?
[4113.98 → 4114.20] No,
[4114.28 → 4114.96] I don't think so.
[4115.36 → 4116.28] It kind of sounds
[4116.28 → 4117.38] like it's like a weird
[4117.38 → 4118.22] insult.
[4118.54 → 4118.92] Dan,
[4119.00 → 4119.82] can you confirm
[4119.82 → 4120.70] is that a thing?
[4120.82 → 4121.32] Just calling someone
[4121.32 → 4121.58] a bag?
[4121.62 → 4121.84] Okay,
[4121.94 → 4122.16] perfect.
[4122.54 → 4123.24] He claims to be
[4123.24 → 4123.46] British.
[4123.74 → 4123.94] Anyway,
[4124.04 → 4124.66] the point is
[4124.66 → 4127.24] that bag enthusiasts
[4127.24 → 4129.12] okay,
[4129.52 → 4130.54] I'm going to finish
[4130.54 → 4130.92] the quote.
[4131.12 → 4131.76] Cougar hunter?
[4131.92 → 4132.04] Wait,
[4132.12 → 4132.24] sorry,
[4132.32 → 4132.46] what?
[4132.58 → 4132.74] Oh,
[4132.84 → 4133.48] I'm going to finish
[4133.48 → 4133.78] the quote.
[4133.96 → 4134.58] I need to stop,
[4134.72 → 4134.88] Linus.
[4135.50 → 4136.54] If you do care
[4136.54 → 4137.10] about looks,
[4137.78 → 4139.00] it's tougher.
[4139.52 → 4140.10] Kudos to Linus
[4140.10 → 4140.52] and the team.
[4140.62 → 4141.20] They made an amazing
[4141.20 → 4142.10] product worth every
[4142.10 → 4142.32] penny.
[4142.56 → 4143.24] You just got to see
[4143.24 → 4143.68] if it's something
[4143.68 → 4144.64] that fits your style.
[4145.62 → 4146.44] You know what?
[4146.52 → 4147.02] It's all fair.
[4147.32 → 4147.66] It's good.
[4147.98 → 4148.62] Big W.
[4148.80 → 4149.78] I consider that
[4149.78 → 4150.88] very fair because
[4150.88 → 4151.94] we knew what we
[4151.94 → 4152.42] were doing.
[4152.90 → 4153.80] People talk about
[4153.80 → 4154.52] how it's boxy
[4154.52 → 4154.96] and I'm like,
[4155.02 → 4155.14] yeah,
[4155.86 → 4156.68] that's how it fits
[4156.68 → 4157.22] so much stuff.
[4157.24 → 4158.18] It's like perfectly
[4158.18 → 4159.06] snugly under an
[4159.06 → 4159.50] airplane seat.
[4159.50 → 4160.22] It's basically the
[4160.22 → 4161.04] size of an airplane
[4161.04 → 4161.54] carry-on.
[4161.68 → 4161.78] Like,
[4161.82 → 4162.28] what do you want
[4162.28 → 4162.62] from me?
[4162.94 → 4164.48] That's by design.
[4164.66 → 4165.98] It's because we
[4165.98 → 4167.20] expect people to be
[4167.20 → 4167.54] able to,
[4167.78 → 4168.50] this is great.
[4168.60 → 4168.72] Oh,
[4168.76 → 4169.36] I love this.
[4169.80 → 4170.80] Judder's list
[4170.80 → 4172.94] and a picture of
[4172.94 → 4173.80] everything that he
[4173.80 → 4174.80] carries in the bag.
[4175.10 → 4176.50] This is freaking
[4176.50 → 4177.14] awesome.
[4177.54 → 4177.72] Okay?
[4178.16 → 4178.92] One laptop,
[4179.26 → 4180.08] sometimes two.
[4180.40 → 4181.58] That's by design
[4181.58 → 4182.72] because we know
[4182.72 → 4183.90] that so many people
[4183.90 → 4184.82] will have a personal
[4184.82 → 4186.22] and a work laptop
[4186.22 → 4186.84] with them,
[4187.08 → 4187.86] sometimes at the
[4187.86 → 4188.36] same time,
[4188.42 → 4189.28] particularly for,
[4189.40 → 4189.58] like,
[4189.72 → 4190.12] when they're
[4190.12 → 4190.50] travelling,
[4190.64 → 4190.86] right?
[4191.40 → 4192.28] Three tablets,
[4192.86 → 4193.22] okay.
[4193.74 → 4194.66] Extra phone,
[4194.92 → 4195.38] yes.
[4195.80 → 4196.54] Three portable
[4196.54 → 4196.94] gaming devices,
[4197.00 → 4197.34] okay.
[4197.86 → 4198.36] Really,
[4198.50 → 4198.70] man?
[4198.88 → 4199.56] I mean,
[4199.64 → 4200.26] you know what?
[4200.88 → 4202.06] These do address
[4202.06 → 4204.34] very different needs.
[4204.88 → 4205.30] A Switch,
[4205.38 → 4205.96] a Steam Deck,
[4206.00 → 4206.48] and a Pocket?
[4206.80 → 4207.12] Yeah.
[4207.20 → 4207.52] I think.
[4207.64 → 4208.00] All right.
[4208.64 → 4209.44] Bunch of cables,
[4209.64 → 4210.12] heck yeah.
[4210.50 → 4211.28] Two pairs of
[4211.28 → 4211.80] headphones,
[4212.04 → 4212.40] all right.
[4212.86 → 4213.84] Hidden AirTag,
[4213.98 → 4214.60] love it.
[4214.86 → 4215.56] Two SSDs,
[4215.60 → 4216.12] USB hub,
[4216.26 → 4217.22] and a portable
[4217.22 → 4218.14] charger.
[4218.88 → 4219.20] Man,
[4219.52 → 4220.70] I love this
[4220.70 → 4221.24] because,
[4221.92 → 4222.30] honestly,
[4222.56 → 4223.06] I've only,
[4223.12 → 4223.80] I've only spoken
[4223.80 → 4224.42] with Judder a
[4224.42 → 4225.24] handful of times.
[4225.52 → 4225.76] Like,
[4225.78 → 4226.38] I wouldn't describe
[4226.38 → 4227.22] us as best of
[4227.22 → 4227.42] friends.
[4227.50 → 4227.92] I definitely
[4227.92 → 4228.82] respect his work
[4228.82 → 4230.42] and every interaction
[4230.42 → 4231.08] I've ever had with
[4231.08 → 4231.44] him has been
[4231.44 → 4232.22] extremely positive,
[4232.22 → 4233.40] but this is not
[4233.40 → 4233.66] just,
[4233.80 → 4234.02] like,
[4234.78 → 4235.56] it's not paid.
[4235.98 → 4236.60] It's not,
[4236.82 → 4237.04] you know,
[4237.10 → 4238.24] my buddy doing me
[4238.24 → 4239.36] a solid or anything
[4239.36 → 4240.00] like that.
[4240.34 → 4241.14] This is what
[4241.14 → 4241.66] they call,
[4241.76 → 4242.44] what's it called?
[4242.90 → 4243.38] Earned.
[4243.66 → 4244.42] Earned media.
[4244.84 → 4245.64] Where someone
[4245.64 → 4246.64] actually saw the
[4246.64 → 4247.08] product,
[4247.44 → 4248.08] felt it was
[4248.08 → 4249.50] valid enough
[4249.50 → 4250.50] to not only
[4250.50 → 4251.12] cover it,
[4251.30 → 4252.02] but actually
[4252.02 → 4253.58] daily freaking
[4253.58 → 4254.08] drive it,
[4254.14 → 4254.76] use it for an
[4254.76 → 4255.56] extended period of
[4255.56 → 4255.86] time,
[4255.86 → 4257.68] and we still get
[4257.68 → 4258.56] the positive review.
[4258.96 → 4259.86] I don't think,
[4259.98 → 4260.74] I don't think we
[4260.74 → 4261.42] even sent one to
[4261.42 → 4261.50] him.
[4261.56 → 4262.00] I would have to
[4262.00 → 4262.48] confirm that.
[4262.66 → 4262.96] I have no idea.
[4263.14 → 4264.10] I don't know,
[4264.22 → 4265.44] but I think,
[4265.84 → 4266.70] I think he might
[4266.70 → 4267.34] have bought it.
[4267.56 → 4268.28] Either way,
[4268.88 → 4269.48] like I said,
[4269.48 → 4270.34] I've been
[4270.34 → 4270.88] following his
[4270.88 → 4271.40] work for a
[4271.40 → 4271.90] long time,
[4272.06 → 4273.52] and I respect
[4273.52 → 4273.74] him.
[4273.80 → 4274.24] I don't think
[4274.24 → 4274.86] he would be
[4274.86 → 4276.36] the kind of
[4276.36 → 4276.82] person who
[4276.82 → 4277.24] would give a
[4277.24 → 4277.90] favourable review
[4277.90 → 4278.52] just because we
[4278.52 → 4279.12] did provide a
[4279.12 → 4279.70] review sample,
[4280.30 → 4281.64] but I actually
[4281.64 → 4282.10] don't know,
[4282.22 → 4282.58] so I'm going to
[4282.58 → 4283.30] find out.
[4283.44 → 4284.00] I will find out.
[4284.12 → 4284.78] I'm calling the
[4284.78 → 4285.30] person who would
[4285.30 → 4285.48] know,
[4285.90 → 4286.56] Mr. Nick Light.
[4286.56 → 4295.38] Who needs time
[4295.38 → 4296.36] off when you
[4296.36 → 4297.00] can talk to
[4297.00 → 4297.50] Linus about
[4297.50 → 4297.86] work?
[4301.02 → 4301.68] This will go
[4301.68 → 4302.16] through at some
[4302.16 → 4302.36] point,
[4302.42 → 4302.60] maybe.
[4303.26 → 4303.68] Hello?
[4304.34 → 4304.74] Hello?
[4305.90 → 4306.60] Tell us?
[4306.84 → 4307.04] Hello?
[4308.14 → 4308.46] Unless,
[4308.62 → 4308.96] unless,
[4309.06 → 4310.20] oh,
[4310.30 → 4310.62] seriously?
[4311.20 → 4311.56] Okay.
[4312.02 → 4313.10] Unless it's
[4313.10 → 4313.64] all of us
[4313.64 → 4314.06] trying to do
[4314.06 → 4314.68] work and Linus
[4314.68 → 4315.30] just won't stop
[4315.30 → 4315.96] playing vampire
[4315.96 → 4316.42] survivors.
[4316.60 → 4316.80] What?
[4317.12 → 4317.42] What are you
[4317.42 → 4318.08] talking about?
[4318.76 → 4319.32] I don't know
[4319.32 → 4319.46] what you're
[4319.46 → 4319.80] talking about.
[4320.54 → 4321.18] I would never
[4321.18 → 4321.58] do that.
[4323.94 → 4324.62] Did you just
[4324.62 → 4325.10] call him in a
[4325.10 → 4325.56] different way?
[4325.90 → 4326.12] Yeah.
[4328.94 → 4329.48] That way,
[4329.56 → 4329.94] if he's, like,
[4330.02 → 4330.68] banging or whatever,
[4330.78 → 4331.16] he'll know it's
[4331.16 → 4331.52] important.
[4338.58 → 4339.16] Is he out of
[4339.16 → 4339.34] breath?
[4342.96 → 4343.36] Hey,
[4343.46 → 4344.24] you're live on
[4344.24 → 4344.84] the WAN show.
[4345.30 → 4347.40] Hello?
[4347.60 → 4347.98] What's up?
[4348.48 → 4348.98] Hey, okay,
[4349.02 → 4349.26] hold on.
[4349.28 → 4349.46] I have to,
[4349.52 → 4350.04] I have to turn you
[4350.04 → 4350.56] up a little bit
[4350.56 → 4350.74] here.
[4351.12 → 4351.60] Hey, I just
[4351.60 → 4352.34] wanted to know,
[4352.44 → 4353.18] did we send
[4353.18 → 4353.70] Judder a
[4353.70 → 4354.22] backpack or
[4354.22 → 4354.70] did he buy
[4354.70 → 4354.90] it?
[4357.40 → 4358.64] Uh, I
[4358.64 → 4359.02] think he
[4359.02 → 4359.38] bought it.
[4359.94 → 4360.44] Okay, but
[4360.44 → 4361.12] you're not aware
[4361.12 → 4361.60] of us sending
[4361.60 → 4362.06] one to him?
[4363.84 → 4365.06] Uh, not to
[4365.06 → 4366.52] my recollection,
[4366.64 → 4367.22] but it's been a
[4367.22 → 4367.96] little while, so
[4367.96 → 4369.04] it is possible,
[4369.14 → 4369.70] but I think he
[4369.70 → 4369.96] bought it.
[4370.18 → 4371.44] Okay, if I
[4371.44 → 4371.98] don't remember
[4371.98 → 4372.52] it and you
[4372.52 → 4373.08] don't remember
[4373.08 → 4373.56] it, I'd say
[4373.56 → 4374.00] that's a pretty
[4374.00 → 4374.96] solid chance that
[4374.96 → 4375.48] we didn't send
[4375.48 → 4375.78] it to him.
[4375.98 → 4376.72] Okay, thanks
[4376.72 → 4377.02] Nick.
[4377.88 → 4378.32] Okay, no
[4378.32 → 4378.48] worries.
[4378.64 → 4379.04] Bye.
[4379.98 → 4380.48] Bye-bye.
[4381.28 → 4381.68] All right, he's
[4381.68 → 4382.14] back to whatever
[4382.14 → 4382.60] he was doing
[4382.60 → 4382.80] now.
[4383.32 → 4383.56] I mean, it
[4383.56 → 4383.86] might get to
[4383.86 → 4384.32] take a second
[4384.32 → 4384.80] to get back
[4384.80 → 4385.16] in the mood,
[4385.26 → 4385.36] but.
[4385.42 → 4385.76] Yeah, yeah,
[4385.76 → 4385.94] yeah.
[4386.20 → 4386.72] Or not.
[4386.80 → 4387.42] By now, he's
[4387.42 → 4388.30] probably, you
[4388.30 → 4389.24] know, settled
[4389.24 → 4389.38] in.
[4389.58 → 4390.06] Anyway, the
[4390.06 → 4390.58] point is, hey,
[4390.66 → 4391.16] thanks for the
[4391.16 → 4391.54] review.
[4392.54 → 4393.34] Appreciate it.
[4393.34 → 4394.26] Even if it
[4394.26 → 4395.70] had been more
[4395.70 → 4397.44] constructive, I
[4397.44 → 4398.32] would still have
[4398.32 → 4399.08] appreciated it.
[4399.16 → 4400.00] We really do
[4400.00 → 4400.60] value honest
[4400.60 → 4403.64] feedback, but I'm
[4403.64 → 4404.22] definitely more
[4404.22 → 4404.78] excited about
[4404.78 → 4405.42] W's.
[4405.62 → 4406.24] I'll just say
[4406.24 → 4406.92] that much.
[4408.52 → 4410.80] Oh, okay, you
[4410.80 → 4410.96] know what?
[4411.00 → 4411.36] No, we'll talk
[4411.36 → 4411.80] about that later.
[4411.90 → 4412.06] Sorry.
[4412.78 → 4413.18] Dave, you want
[4413.18 → 4413.68] to pick a topic?
[4414.16 → 4414.94] Sure, sure,
[4415.02 → 4415.34] sure, sure,
[4415.34 → 4415.66] sure, sure,
[4415.66 → 4416.02] sure, sure.
[4417.02 → 4418.06] SpaceX starship
[4418.06 → 4419.42] successfully explodes.
[4419.42 → 4420.20] Okay, that's
[4420.20 → 4421.90] not actually that
[4421.90 → 4422.38] misleading.
[4422.72 → 4423.22] Yeah, yeah,
[4423.32 → 4423.54] okay.
[4424.28 → 4425.30] Yeah, pretty much.
[4425.36 → 4425.84] Do go on.
[4426.00 → 4426.76] SpaceX launched
[4426.76 → 4427.82] its new starship
[4427.82 → 4428.52] rocket system
[4428.52 → 4429.02] yesterday.
[4429.24 → 4429.74] A few minutes
[4429.74 → 4430.64] later, the rocket
[4430.64 → 4431.38] experienced what
[4431.38 → 4432.12] SpaceX Twitter
[4432.12 → 4432.88] account called,
[4433.28 → 4433.96] and their live
[4433.96 → 4434.52] stream and lots
[4434.52 → 4434.94] of other things,
[4435.34 → 4436.88] because it's
[4436.88 → 4437.76] actually an actual
[4437.76 → 4438.66] terminology, a
[4438.66 → 4439.52] RUD or a
[4439.52 → 4440.60] rapid unscheduled
[4440.60 → 4441.78] disassembly before
[4441.78 → 4442.82] stage separation,
[4443.16 → 4443.50] i.e.
[4444.20 → 4445.08] Ka boom.
[4446.10 → 4447.00] Much online
[4447.00 → 4447.74] commentary has
[4447.74 → 4448.72] framed this as
[4448.72 → 4449.34] a failure,
[4449.42 → 4450.22] but it wasn't.
[4450.28 → 4451.08] It was a test
[4451.08 → 4452.18] flight for a new,
[4452.30 → 4452.88] more powerful
[4452.88 → 4453.62] rocket system.
[4453.98 → 4454.58] The flight was
[4454.58 → 4455.50] unmanned, and
[4455.50 → 4456.16] there was no
[4456.16 → 4457.16] reported injuries
[4457.16 → 4461.16] or damage to
[4461.16 → 4462.10] property beyond
[4462.10 → 4462.82] the rocket and
[4462.82 → 4463.28] its payload.
[4463.42 → 4464.20] That is not
[4464.20 → 4465.22] true at all,
[4465.42 → 4466.02] but I'll go
[4466.02 → 4466.46] into that in a
[4466.46 → 4466.66] second.
[4467.00 → 4467.58] SpaceX has
[4467.58 → 4468.48] previously warned
[4468.48 → 4469.22] that the odds
[4469.22 → 4470.00] of success were
[4470.00 → 4470.88] low, and the
[4470.88 → 4471.46] primary purpose
[4471.46 → 4471.90] of the launch
[4471.90 → 4472.48] was to collect
[4472.48 → 4473.64] data, and data
[4473.64 → 4474.72] collection did
[4474.72 → 4475.24] they do.
[4475.90 → 4477.02] A bunch of
[4477.02 → 4477.72] things was very
[4477.72 → 4478.10] useful.
[4478.10 → 4479.12] The launch
[4479.12 → 4481.78] pad is gone.
[4483.16 → 4484.20] So there was
[4484.20 → 4484.98] damage to more
[4484.98 → 4486.08] things than just
[4486.08 → 4487.10] the rocket and
[4487.10 → 4487.62] its payload,
[4488.02 → 4488.58] because the
[4488.58 → 4489.56] launch pad was
[4489.56 → 4491.28] burnt to an
[4491.28 → 4491.68] absolute.
[4491.90 → 4492.72] It's literally
[4492.72 → 4493.12] gone.
[4493.20 → 4493.70] There's a hole.
[4494.26 → 4494.40] Right.
[4494.40 → 4495.46] So that wasn't
[4495.46 → 4495.92] intended.
[4496.62 → 4497.72] And there's some
[4497.72 → 4498.96] ideas there.
[4499.46 → 4500.14] There was
[4500.14 → 4500.94] environmental damage.
[4501.08 → 4502.34] Yeah, I'm assuming
[4502.34 → 4502.76] so.
[4503.14 → 4504.48] The whole launch
[4504.48 → 4505.30] pad is gone, and
[4505.30 → 4505.94] there's a huge
[4505.94 → 4506.26] hole.
[4506.56 → 4507.74] So you could call
[4507.74 → 4508.26] that environmental
[4508.26 → 4508.66] damage.
[4509.04 → 4509.90] They have some
[4509.90 → 4511.18] plans of how to
[4511.18 → 4511.80] deal with that in
[4511.80 → 4512.30] the future.
[4512.78 → 4513.32] A lot of them
[4513.32 → 4514.12] actually, and I'm
[4514.12 → 4514.92] sure they'll address
[4514.92 → 4515.10] it.
[4515.18 → 4516.36] But this is one
[4516.36 → 4517.78] of the whole goals
[4517.78 → 4518.52] of this thing,
[4518.58 → 4518.78] right?
[4519.78 → 4521.96] Unintended launch pad
[4521.96 → 4522.32] removal.
[4522.62 → 4522.78] Yeah.
[4523.58 → 4524.44] You know, they
[4524.44 → 4526.10] rapidly prepped the
[4526.10 → 4527.78] site for new
[4527.78 → 4528.26] development.
[4530.38 → 4531.14] Verbal Space
[4531.14 → 4531.82] Program style.
[4531.90 → 4532.26] Let's go.
[4532.34 → 4532.78] Yeah, yeah.
[4532.94 → 4534.06] So I think it's
[4534.06 → 4534.38] sweet.
[4535.38 → 4535.96] Someone apparently
[4535.96 → 4536.94] got hit by debris.
[4537.56 → 4538.08] Did they actually?
[4538.42 → 4539.28] That's what someone's
[4539.28 → 4539.52] saying.
[4539.88 → 4541.08] A car got hit 500
[4541.08 → 4542.50] meters away, which
[4542.50 → 4543.48] is 500 meters from
[4543.48 → 4543.88] the launch site.
[4543.96 → 4544.42] Probably shouldn't
[4544.42 → 4545.12] park your car there.
[4545.50 → 4545.94] Well.
[4546.14 → 4546.82] Note for next time.
[4547.04 → 4548.14] I mean, yeah, but
[4548.14 → 4549.94] also like it could
[4549.94 → 4550.50] have been a lot more
[4550.50 → 4551.64] than 500 meters, too.
[4551.64 → 4552.00] Yeah.
[4553.04 → 4554.12] I'm not going to
[4554.12 → 4555.02] believe any of those
[4555.02 → 4556.14] things unless I see
[4556.14 → 4557.12] official details.
[4557.36 → 4558.02] Oh, is this a
[4558.02 → 4558.90] screenshot of the
[4558.90 → 4559.40] launch pad?
[4559.80 → 4560.16] Yeah.
[4560.48 → 4560.78] Okay.
[4560.96 → 4561.50] I'm coming over to
[4561.50 → 4561.88] your laptop.
[4562.18 → 4562.46] Yeah.
[4562.76 → 4564.70] So damage to only
[4564.70 → 4566.76] the starship is a
[4566.76 → 4568.46] not so much because
[4568.46 → 4569.26] there used to be a
[4569.26 → 4570.36] flat launch pad there.
[4570.44 → 4570.90] We call that a
[4570.90 → 4571.54] whoops doodles.
[4571.70 → 4571.88] Yep.
[4572.36 → 4573.50] But again, like
[4573.50 → 4575.38] they, as far as my
[4575.38 → 4576.00] understanding goes,
[4576.06 → 4576.80] they were aware that
[4576.80 → 4577.40] there might be some
[4577.40 → 4578.48] problems there and
[4578.48 → 4579.28] they already have
[4579.28 → 4580.38] plans for fixing it
[4580.38 → 4581.00] for next time.
[4581.00 → 4582.12] This is what tests
[4582.12 → 4582.92] are kind of about,
[4582.92 → 4583.28] right?
[4583.28 → 4583.98] Like there's going to
[4583.98 → 4584.78] be problems.
[4584.78 → 4585.70] The fact that it
[4585.70 → 4586.78] blew up was not,
[4586.78 → 4589.00] um, was not
[4589.00 → 4590.56] actually like an
[4590.56 → 4590.88] issue.
[4591.22 → 4592.18] It was fine.
[4592.18 → 4593.10] They went into this
[4593.10 → 4594.88] 100% expecting that
[4594.88 → 4595.60] that could be a very
[4595.60 → 4596.50] likely outcome, right?
[4596.60 → 4597.34] If, if my
[4597.34 → 4597.86] understanding was
[4597.86 → 4598.60] correct, they
[4598.60 → 4599.64] expected it to land
[4599.64 → 4600.52] in the water and be
[4600.52 → 4601.40] like not properly
[4601.40 → 4602.48] recoverable, even if
[4602.48 → 4603.22] it didn't blow up.
[4603.22 → 4607.60] So like, yeah, it's
[4607.60 → 4607.88] a thing.
[4610.58 → 4610.90] Yeah.
[4611.06 → 4611.60] But yeah, that's
[4611.60 → 4611.80] cool.
[4611.92 → 4612.76] If you haven't seen
[4612.76 → 4613.92] it yet, I don't
[4613.92 → 4614.28] think we're going to
[4614.28 → 4614.98] show the footage here,
[4615.04 → 4615.44] but you should go
[4615.44 → 4616.06] watch it because it's
[4616.06 → 4617.00] actually like really
[4617.00 → 4617.30] cool.
[4617.42 → 4617.54] Yeah.
[4617.54 → 4618.00] It's pretty wild.
[4618.48 → 4618.68] Yeah.
[4618.78 → 4619.44] I've read some
[4619.44 → 4619.78] theories.
[4619.90 → 4620.24] I don't know how
[4620.24 → 4621.02] much of this stuff is
[4621.02 → 4621.90] true, but some of the
[4621.90 → 4622.56] issues with the
[4622.56 → 4624.10] launch pad are why
[4624.10 → 4625.10] some of the boosters
[4625.10 → 4626.48] didn't actually fire
[4626.48 → 4626.96] properly.
[4626.96 → 4629.22] So the boosters not
[4629.22 → 4630.02] firing properly might
[4630.02 → 4631.06] not be as big of an
[4631.06 → 4632.52] issue as we initially
[4632.52 → 4633.28] thought, because I
[4633.28 → 4633.70] think it might be
[4633.70 → 4634.46] related to the launch
[4634.46 → 4634.74] pad.
[4635.12 → 4635.94] I don't know if that's
[4635.94 → 4636.52] true or not.
[4636.60 → 4637.30] I've seen a lot of
[4637.30 → 4638.20] information on this that
[4638.20 → 4639.00] has already been
[4639.00 → 4639.92] debunked.
[4640.38 → 4641.54] So yeah, look into
[4641.54 → 4642.42] yourself if you want.
[4642.70 → 4644.90] The amount of armchair
[4644.90 → 4646.30] scientists has been
[4646.30 → 4647.66] very fun to watch.
[4648.08 → 4649.40] These idiots, they
[4649.40 → 4650.22] should have done this
[4650.22 → 4650.58] thing.
[4651.10 → 4651.82] Yeah, sure, dude.
[4652.60 → 4653.08] Yeah, but they
[4653.08 → 4653.72] didn't think of that.
[4653.72 → 4654.08] Yeah.
[4654.42 → 4655.52] Like there's all,
[4655.64 → 4656.22] there's plenty of
[4656.22 → 4656.90] things as far as I
[4656.90 → 4657.76] can tell from actual
[4657.76 → 4659.00] real sources that
[4659.00 → 4659.98] like they did think
[4659.98 → 4660.58] of, but you're going
[4660.58 → 4661.32] to think of different
[4661.32 → 4662.42] things forever.
[4662.42 → 4663.28] And at a certain
[4663.28 → 4663.96] point, you just need
[4663.96 → 4664.56] to test what you
[4664.56 → 4664.82] got.
[4664.94 → 4665.48] It's kind of like,
[4665.48 → 4666.36] it's kind of like a
[4666.36 → 4666.98] lot of the things that
[4666.98 → 4667.74] I see in the comments
[4667.74 → 4668.52] under our videos.
[4668.78 → 4670.38] Like a perfect
[4670.38 → 4671.30] one is at some
[4671.30 → 4672.16] point I was talking
[4672.16 → 4672.90] about how we've
[4672.90 → 4673.46] reordered more
[4673.46 → 4674.28] screwdrivers and
[4674.28 → 4675.98] someone basically was
[4675.98 → 4677.28] like after the
[4677.28 → 4678.02] failure of the
[4678.02 → 4678.62] backpack and
[4678.62 → 4679.50] screwdriver, how could
[4679.50 → 4680.26] he possibly is
[4680.26 → 4680.50] ordering?
[4681.54 → 4682.88] Okay, come outside
[4682.88 → 4683.96] your, your little
[4683.96 → 4684.88] bubble that you live
[4684.88 → 4685.84] inside for two
[4685.84 → 4686.30] seconds.
[4686.30 → 4687.52] And, or like,
[4687.52 → 4688.94] would you even be
[4688.94 → 4690.08] willing to consider
[4690.08 → 4692.56] that I am a just
[4692.56 → 4693.96] marginally rational
[4693.96 → 4695.36] being for a moment
[4695.36 → 4696.58] and that I wouldn't
[4696.58 → 4697.42] throw good money
[4697.42 → 4698.22] after bad.
[4698.32 → 4699.56] If I'm ordering
[4699.56 → 4701.80] more, okay, if we're
[4701.80 → 4702.54] working on Lux
[4702.54 → 4703.42] backpack, if we're
[4703.42 → 4703.96] working on new
[4703.96 → 4704.64] colourways of the
[4704.64 → 4706.74] screwdriver, if that's
[4706.74 → 4708.40] happening, could you
[4708.40 → 4710.20] not consider a reason
[4710.20 → 4711.32] other than me being
[4711.32 → 4712.74] phenomenally stupid
[4712.74 → 4713.68] stupid, that I might
[4713.68 → 4715.22] be ordering more of
[4715.22 → 4715.62] them, right?
[4715.98 → 4717.54] Like, oh, right.
[4717.66 → 4719.04] If it, sorry, I
[4719.04 → 4719.78] actually worded that
[4719.78 → 4720.02] wrong.
[4720.10 → 4720.62] Maybe I am
[4720.62 → 4721.40] phenomenally stupid,
[4721.40 → 4723.22] but it was probably
[4723.22 → 4724.44] successful, right?
[4724.52 → 4725.42] Otherwise, I would be
[4725.42 → 4726.36] phenomenally stupid to
[4726.36 → 4727.16] be ordering more.
[4727.16 → 4729.84] So if your brain can't
[4729.84 → 4731.72] handle any reality where
[4731.72 → 4732.52] I am not just
[4732.52 → 4734.36] spectacularly dumb and
[4734.36 → 4735.18] these were a failure,
[4735.72 → 4736.86] maybe the problem is
[4736.86 → 4737.08] you.
[4737.62 → 4739.02] And it's the same for
[4739.02 → 4740.22] looking at stuff like
[4740.22 → 4740.46] this.
[4740.68 → 4742.98] Like, uh, yeah, a lot
[4742.98 → 4744.44] of experts do work at
[4744.44 → 4745.40] SpaceX, and they've done a
[4745.40 → 4746.16] lot of stuff that's,
[4746.94 → 4747.86] quite frankly, just
[4747.86 → 4749.76] mind-bending, game
[4749.76 → 4750.16] changing.
[4750.16 → 4752.96] Yeah, utter failure.
[4753.06 → 4754.28] LTTstore.com says
[4754.28 → 4755.36] Curb over on
[4755.36 → 4756.98] Twitch orders more
[4756.98 → 4757.86] failed products that
[4757.86 → 4759.02] mysteriously sell out.
[4759.22 → 4759.98] It's probably a
[4759.98 → 4760.40] conspiracy.
[4760.60 → 4761.44] I'm probably hiding
[4761.44 → 4762.82] those products in a
[4762.82 → 4763.58] warehouse somewhere,
[4763.68 → 4764.84] just shovelling them in
[4764.84 → 4765.70] there so that I can
[4765.70 → 4766.36] pretend they're sold
[4766.36 → 4767.02] out so that I can
[4767.02 → 4767.66] order more.
[4769.04 → 4769.80] Apparently there was,
[4769.88 → 4770.82] yeah, I have, there's,
[4770.90 → 4771.68] I don't know if this is
[4771.68 → 4772.74] legit at all.
[4773.00 → 4773.60] Uh, I'm not even
[4773.60 → 4774.48] going to show it, but
[4774.48 → 4775.78] there's, there's a van
[4775.78 → 4776.66] and it shows it getting
[4776.66 → 4777.80] hit by what looks like
[4777.80 → 4778.78] some flying blocks of
[4778.78 → 4778.92] cement.
[4778.92 → 4779.76] No, apparently it was
[4779.76 → 4780.98] parked there to record
[4780.98 → 4781.58] the launch and they
[4781.58 → 4782.06] knew the risk.
[4782.24 → 4782.34] Yeah.
[4782.34 → 4782.96] And that is real.
[4783.12 → 4783.30] Yeah.
[4783.46 → 4783.72] Okay.
[4783.90 → 4784.08] Yeah.
[4784.16 → 4784.86] Uh, chat was talking
[4784.86 → 4785.52] about that a fair bit
[4785.52 → 4785.80] before.
[4786.12 → 4786.50] Well, okay.
[4786.52 → 4787.26] I mean, if that's the
[4787.26 → 4788.04] case, then it sounds
[4788.04 → 4788.24] good.
[4788.24 → 4788.90] Cause yeah, when like,
[4788.98 → 4789.66] if you go to watch
[4789.66 → 4790.24] these things, you have
[4790.24 → 4791.20] to be really far.
[4791.34 → 4792.58] That's still damage.
[4792.74 → 4793.10] For sure.
[4793.38 → 4794.90] So it definitely still
[4794.90 → 4795.96] wasn't just the rocket.
[4796.84 → 4797.68] Oh, yeah.
[4797.68 → 4798.66] That's the only, that's
[4798.66 → 4799.36] the only point.
[4799.48 → 4799.78] For sure.
[4799.94 → 4800.44] Yeah, definitely.
[4800.72 → 4800.90] Yeah.
[4800.90 → 4801.06] Yeah.
[4801.06 → 4801.34] Yeah.
[4801.34 → 4801.66] Yeah.
[4801.66 → 4802.62] I never thought it was
[4802.62 → 4803.24] just the rocket.
[4803.56 → 4805.92] Um, but yeah, really,
[4806.04 → 4807.22] really, really cool to see.
[4807.22 → 4807.98] I'm excited.
[4807.98 → 4809.58] I have had like no time
[4809.58 → 4811.12] since the launch to
[4811.12 → 4812.36] actually like look into
[4812.36 → 4812.60] it.
[4812.60 → 4814.04] Because I've just been very
[4814.04 → 4815.40] busy, but I'm excited to
[4815.40 → 4816.18] look into it more.
[4816.74 → 4818.20] Um, and I've heard lots
[4818.20 → 4819.14] of really cool things and
[4819.14 → 4820.02] I want to see more of it.
[4820.08 → 4821.40] I watched like just the
[4821.40 → 4822.16] little, like, you know,
[4822.20 → 4823.36] three, four minute clip.
[4823.52 → 4823.76] Yeah.
[4824.10 → 4825.86] And that was awesome.
[4826.10 → 4826.96] So I'm excited to watch
[4826.96 → 4827.18] more.
[4827.50 → 4828.26] Neman float playing
[4828.26 → 4829.04] chat says these guys
[4829.04 → 4829.90] clearly don't understand
[4829.90 → 4831.22] the concept of a whale or
[4831.22 → 4832.02] how many you have.
[4832.18 → 4833.58] It's not actually the whales
[4833.58 → 4834.48] that drive the store
[4834.48 → 4834.96] success.
[4835.42 → 4835.76] Like we have.
[4836.00 → 4836.12] What do you mean?
[4836.68 → 4837.08] What?
[4837.22 → 4839.08] I could totally see a
[4839.08 → 4840.18] whale buying 50,000
[4840.18 → 4840.74] screwdrivers.
[4840.98 → 4841.28] Why not?
[4841.86 → 4842.72] That's not how that
[4842.72 → 4843.06] works.
[4843.46 → 4845.00] Like we have stats and
[4845.00 → 4846.12] there are people whose
[4846.12 → 4847.82] lifetime spend is very
[4847.82 → 4849.82] high because like as
[4849.82 → 4851.36] there as much of their
[4851.36 → 4852.94] wardrobe is LTT store as
[4852.94 → 4853.52] mine is.
[4854.00 → 4856.16] Uh, but there's only so
[4856.16 → 4857.56] many shirts you can buy.
[4857.68 → 4857.82] Yeah.
[4858.02 → 4859.12] Like there's a limit,
[4859.20 → 4859.38] right?
[4859.44 → 4860.42] You can't, you can't go
[4860.42 → 4862.84] full like, um, you know,
[4862.84 → 4863.68] I'm trying to think like
[4863.68 → 4866.04] Candy Crush whale on this,
[4866.04 → 4867.64] uh, rise of kingdoms or
[4867.64 → 4869.10] whatever the mobile games
[4869.10 → 4869.52] are called.
[4869.60 → 4870.16] What's, what's that
[4870.16 → 4871.30] cringe one that everyone's
[4871.30 → 4872.40] mad at people for taking
[4872.40 → 4873.48] sponsorship money from?
[4874.36 → 4875.90] Not Clash of Clans, uh,
[4875.90 → 4877.04] Raid Shadow Legends,
[4877.22 → 4877.32] right?
[4877.38 → 4878.54] Like we're not talking about
[4878.54 → 4880.06] people spending tens of
[4880.06 → 4881.06] thousands of dollars on
[4881.06 → 4881.98] LTT store.com.
[4882.04 → 4882.88] You can only use so many
[4882.88 → 4884.10] screwdrivers at once.
[4884.56 → 4885.92] Uh, no, we actually just
[4885.92 → 4887.48] really did sell over a
[4887.48 → 4887.98] hundred thousand
[4887.98 → 4888.62] screwdrivers.
[4888.62 → 4889.54] I think we're up to about
[4889.54 → 4891.48] 125, 130,000.
[4891.48 → 4893.40] Now we're moving, we, we
[4893.40 → 4894.64] removed the counter, but I
[4894.64 → 4895.30] mean, I'm all about
[4895.30 → 4896.24] transparency guys.
[4896.36 → 4897.62] Uh, so we're still moving
[4897.62 → 4900.06] on average about 200 to
[4900.06 → 4901.58] 250 a day.
[4902.24 → 4904.50] It's wildly successful.
[4904.76 → 4907.28] And no, it's not because we
[4907.28 → 4908.98] have somehow bamboozled
[4908.98 → 4910.36] people into buying it.
[4910.40 → 4911.32] There's just one person.
[4911.32 → 4912.34] It just takes them that
[4912.34 → 4914.04] long to add 250 to the cart.
[4914.16 → 4915.78] It's just, it's, I'm telling
[4915.78 → 4917.14] you, man, it's just, it's
[4917.14 → 4918.22] just one way, one whale
[4918.22 → 4918.94] runs the whole store.
[4919.26 → 4919.54] Okay.
[4920.34 → 4920.70] Yeah.
[4920.92 → 4921.86] Oh yeah.
[4921.98 → 4922.42] How do you think
[4922.42 → 4923.36] everything released is
[4923.36 → 4923.82] successful?
[4925.42 → 4925.82] Yeah.
[4926.16 → 4927.30] I mean, it's got to be just
[4927.30 → 4927.96] that one.
[4929.02 → 4929.74] It's not because they're
[4929.74 → 4930.36] good products.
[4930.68 → 4931.62] It's just one big whale.
[4932.36 → 4932.78] Yeah.
[4932.84 → 4934.10] Any, any opposition I've
[4934.10 → 4935.22] had to anything that Elon
[4935.22 → 4936.42] Musk has done is actually
[4936.42 → 4937.58] just a big smoke screen
[4937.58 → 4939.86] because we're BFFs and he
[4939.86 → 4941.04] orders everything off of
[4941.04 → 4942.50] LTT store.com just as a
[4942.50 → 4943.26] personal favour.
[4943.48 → 4943.70] Yeah.
[4943.96 → 4944.14] Yeah.
[4944.22 → 4944.44] Yeah.
[4944.44 → 4945.44] And then I, I've got to
[4945.44 → 4946.90] kind of run interference on
[4946.90 → 4947.66] this whole thing.
[4947.78 → 4949.12] That's where my like 40
[4949.12 → 4950.42] chess theories about him
[4950.42 → 4951.54] trying to offload Twitter
[4951.54 → 4953.18] while he secretly turns it
[4953.18 → 4954.40] into the app,
[4954.48 → 4955.54] but people won't see it
[4955.54 → 4957.10] coming because I'm out
[4957.10 → 4958.54] here talking about how
[4958.54 → 4959.52] he's actually trying to get
[4959.52 → 4959.92] rid of it.
[4959.94 → 4960.52] And then the value is
[4960.52 → 4961.28] going to go up and the
[4961.28 → 4961.76] shares are going to be
[4961.76 → 4962.52] worth so much.
[4963.12 → 4964.16] It's a it's a brilliant
[4964.16 → 4964.54] plan.
[4964.96 → 4966.00] We should probably talk
[4966.00 → 4966.56] about Twitter.
[4967.10 → 4967.78] Oh, what?
[4968.10 → 4968.90] Not much.
[4969.14 → 4971.90] Um, well, I lost my
[4971.90 → 4972.30] check mark.
[4972.34 → 4972.84] What did they do?
[4972.84 → 4977.80] Oh, to be clear, neither
[4977.80 → 4978.70] of us ever had personal
[4978.70 → 4979.00] ones.
[4979.20 → 4981.20] I was, I was actually so
[4981.20 → 4983.38] far ahead of the curve on
[4983.38 → 4983.78] this one.
[4984.02 → 4985.16] It's not often.
[4985.28 → 4986.48] Look, I'm, I'm going to,
[4986.54 → 4987.56] I'm going to take this W
[4987.56 → 4989.32] where I can because it is
[4989.32 → 4991.88] so rare that I am ahead of
[4991.88 → 4992.32] the trend.
[4993.12 → 4993.60] Okay.
[4993.72 → 4995.84] I was already too cool for a
[4995.84 → 4996.50] blue check mark.
[4996.76 → 4998.40] We had one on the corporate
[4998.40 → 4999.82] account and that was really
[4999.82 → 5001.10] important because it reduces
[5001.10 → 5002.00] impersonation.
[5002.42 → 5003.88] Well, that's really the main
[5003.88 → 5004.72] reason it reduces
[5004.72 → 5006.58] impersonation, and we don't
[5006.58 → 5007.76] want a situation where
[5007.76 → 5008.80] people are getting scammed.
[5009.22 → 5010.74] Uh, Twitter seemed to care
[5010.74 → 5011.64] about that before.
[5011.64 → 5013.64] So they would verify notable
[5014.24 → 5015.54] personalities and companies.
[5015.78 → 5017.72] And we treated that account
[5017.72 → 5019.26] as our, as our corporate
[5019.26 → 5019.62] account.
[5019.66 → 5020.76] And we, we continue to,
[5020.88 → 5021.78] it's at Linus Tech.
[5022.22 → 5024.48] Uh, but once I handed Linus
[5024.48 → 5026.30] Tech, which was my personal
[5026.30 → 5027.86] account before, once I handed
[5027.86 → 5029.44] it over to Linus Media Group
[5029.44 → 5029.76] Inc.
[5029.76 → 5031.34] and then started my personal
[5031.34 → 5032.38] Twitter, which is at Linus
[5032.38 → 5032.52] G.
[5032.58 → 5032.98] Sebastian.
[5033.64 → 5035.76] Uh, even once they opened up
[5035.76 → 5037.16] Twitter verification to anyone
[5037.16 → 5038.64] who applied for it, as long as
[5038.64 → 5041.10] you verified your identity, I was
[5041.10 → 5046.88] like, no, no, I'm going to be,
[5046.92 → 5048.84] I'm going to be verified by my
[5048.84 → 5052.06] follower count and by my irreverence
[5052.06 → 5055.28] here on everything that I am
[5055.28 → 5056.44] tweeting at people.
[5056.44 → 5058.22] And if you don't know that that's
[5058.22 → 5059.58] actually me, then I guess you're just
[5059.58 → 5060.06] don't know.
[5060.26 → 5061.54] I guess you're, guess you're not in
[5061.54 → 5061.88] the know.
[5062.24 → 5065.88] So I am just as unverified as I was
[5065.88 → 5066.38] before.
[5066.74 → 5068.74] Um, but slightly less irreverent
[5068.74 → 5070.22] because I haven't really posted that
[5070.22 → 5070.48] much.
[5070.56 → 5073.22] I came out of semi-retirement to, um,
[5073.32 → 5075.32] mock someone who suggested that I
[5075.32 → 5077.00] couldn't afford the $8 a month for a
[5077.00 → 5077.42] blue tick.
[5077.42 → 5082.82] And I was like, let me tell you, $8 a
[5082.82 → 5086.26] month, utterly meaningless in the
[5086.26 → 5088.56] context of Linus Media Group's
[5088.56 → 5089.56] operations here.
[5089.92 → 5091.78] If we don't have a blue check mark,
[5091.82 → 5093.74] it's because I decide not to.
[5094.58 → 5096.72] It also isn't $8 for the company,
[5096.78 → 5096.96] right?
[5097.46 → 5098.48] So it depends.
[5098.60 → 5100.54] It depends on what you're trying to do.
[5100.92 → 5102.90] Um, I forget how the like thousand
[5102.90 → 5104.12] dollar a month one works.
[5104.20 → 5105.40] I haven't really looked into it that
[5105.40 → 5106.78] much because frankly, I don't care.
[5106.78 → 5108.48] A free speech platform where you
[5108.48 → 5110.04] have to pay to be heard is not a
[5110.04 → 5110.84] free speech platform.
[5110.96 → 5112.54] That's simply not how that works.
[5112.62 → 5113.84] What is, what does he call it again?
[5113.92 → 5114.22] I don't know.
[5114.48 → 5114.74] Town Square.
[5115.02 → 5115.60] No, no, no, no, no.
[5115.88 → 5119.46] The, the like form of he's like free
[5119.46 → 5120.80] speech, but not free.
[5121.90 → 5122.62] I don't know.
[5122.74 → 5124.34] Anything you have to pay for is not
[5124.34 → 5126.28] free because it doesn't apply to the
[5126.28 → 5127.46] people who can't pay for it.
[5127.58 → 5129.12] So it's, well, he had a term for it
[5129.12 → 5130.38] because like you could still tweet.
[5130.48 → 5132.32] You just don't get the promotion or
[5132.32 → 5132.56] whatever.
[5132.66 → 5133.32] Oh, right.
[5133.42 → 5135.74] Which is exactly what Twitter was
[5135.74 → 5137.06] accused of doing in the past.
[5137.42 → 5137.74] Which is effectively deep.
[5137.74 → 5138.68] No, I'm not, I'm not trying to
[5138.68 → 5139.14] defend it.
[5139.20 → 5140.88] He just, he had, he had like a word
[5140.88 → 5141.86] for it or a phrase for it or
[5141.86 → 5142.02] something.
[5142.10 → 5142.66] I don't know what it was.
[5142.82 → 5144.16] It was the kind of thing that if
[5144.16 → 5145.90] you believe it, then free speech
[5145.90 → 5146.52] paid reach.
[5146.74 → 5147.60] Yeah, I think that's it.
[5147.70 → 5150.16] Then you, um, I don't know, I guess
[5150.16 → 5152.44] freedom of speech, not freedom of
[5152.44 → 5152.68] reach.
[5152.84 → 5153.42] There you go.
[5153.52 → 5153.80] Sure.
[5153.80 → 5156.22] Anyway, moving on.
[5156.30 → 5156.96] Twitter sucks.
[5157.04 → 5158.12] No, I want to talk about our plan.
[5158.76 → 5161.62] Uh, we have a plan for Twitter.
[5161.86 → 5162.04] Yeah.
[5162.24 → 5162.62] Okay.
[5162.92 → 5166.44] So depending on how things go over
[5166.44 → 5167.76] the next little while with Twitter,
[5167.76 → 5170.18] uh, it could be that, you know, we
[5170.18 → 5171.66] continue to engage on there the way
[5171.66 → 5172.56] that we always have.
[5172.64 → 5174.84] Uh, it could be that, you know, it
[5174.84 → 5177.06] ends up not being, not making as much
[5177.06 → 5177.34] sense.
[5177.34 → 5179.54] Like if the audience dwindles, then,
[5179.82 → 5181.00] you know, we might, we might not
[5181.00 → 5183.02] continue, but whatever ends up
[5183.02 → 5185.00] happening over on Twitter, I think
[5185.00 → 5186.70] what we're going to do is we're
[5186.70 → 5188.36] going to lean hard into YouTube
[5188.36 → 5188.82] community.
[5190.08 → 5190.56] Yeah.
[5190.66 → 5192.24] Like the, the reach is better.
[5192.90 → 5195.22] Um, it engages more directly with
[5195.22 → 5196.90] our core audience, which is on
[5196.90 → 5197.46] YouTube.
[5197.82 → 5200.60] Um, on the, on the occasional times
[5200.60 → 5202.58] that we have posted what we put on
[5202.58 → 5203.84] Twitter, which is usually just like
[5203.84 → 5205.40] kind of posting and stuff like that.
[5205.40 → 5208.80] Uh, it's been received extremely
[5208.80 → 5210.80] well in YouTube community posts.
[5210.92 → 5212.16] I will also say for the, for the
[5212.16 → 5213.36] float plane people, if you're not
[5213.36 → 5215.18] already on the beta site, uh, I
[5215.18 → 5216.44] would suggest doing it because it's
[5216.44 → 5217.80] like way more awesome and stuff.
[5218.16 → 5220.24] Uh, but we, another, you might
[5220.24 → 5221.12] have noticed a lot of little
[5221.12 → 5222.18] features coming out over the last
[5222.18 → 5222.56] few weeks.
[5222.60 → 5223.78] Another one of those that we're
[5223.78 → 5226.28] planning, uh, which is very close
[5226.28 → 5229.14] to being ready is configurable
[5229.14 → 5230.60] notifications for sub channels.
[5230.72 → 5232.00] So you might already see if you're
[5232.00 → 5233.72] subscribed to Linus tech tips that,
[5233.96 → 5235.38] well, that's a collapsed sidebar too,
[5235.70 → 5237.26] but, but you can see how there's like
[5237.26 → 5239.16] all the so there's the arrow at the
[5239.16 → 5239.38] bottom.
[5239.38 → 5240.12] One sec, I'm working on it.
[5240.12 → 5241.30] I'm a, I'm a working on it.
[5241.34 → 5241.74] There we go.
[5242.10 → 5243.62] You can, you can manually collapse
[5243.62 → 5245.60] it, but, um, there's one little
[5245.60 → 5246.86] update now where click the little
[5246.86 → 5247.14] arrow.
[5248.78 → 5250.48] So you can, you can expand and
[5250.48 → 5252.42] collapse that without re-navigating
[5252.42 → 5253.00] where you are.
[5253.10 → 5253.60] Oh, okay.
[5254.88 → 5255.22] Oh, cool.
[5255.22 → 5255.70] Okay.
[5255.90 → 5256.32] So, yeah.
[5256.42 → 5258.06] So that, that changed like literally
[5258.06 → 5258.40] today.
[5258.40 → 5260.18] Uh, but we're going to have another
[5260.18 → 5262.18] sub channel for these like social
[5262.18 → 5263.52] posts or community posts or whatever
[5263.52 → 5263.78] they are.
[5263.78 → 5265.24] We just don't want to add it right
[5265.24 → 5267.18] now because right now you wouldn't
[5267.18 → 5268.26] be able to turn the notifications
[5268.26 → 5269.58] off for just that.
[5269.84 → 5270.20] Right.
[5270.32 → 5271.36] And if you're, if you have
[5271.36 → 5272.92] notifications on for everything that
[5272.92 → 5274.64] Linus tech tips offers and LMG
[5274.64 → 5275.90] clips, which is going to be added,
[5276.08 → 5277.48] it'll be a little overwhelming and
[5277.48 → 5278.50] social posts and everything else.
[5278.56 → 5279.44] It's going to be very overwhelming.
[5279.44 → 5280.90] So we're waiting to add some of
[5280.90 → 5282.42] those until this feature comes in,
[5282.46 → 5283.60] which is like literally right around
[5283.60 → 5283.96] the corner.
[5284.06 → 5285.46] And then you'll be able to manually
[5285.46 → 5286.74] configure notifications for each
[5286.74 → 5287.88] sub channel, however you want.
[5287.94 → 5289.44] And then we'll have all those types of
[5289.44 → 5290.40] things on here as well.
[5290.52 → 5291.86] So you won't be, you won't be left
[5291.86 → 5292.08] out.
[5292.34 → 5293.70] Uh, we've got some, some
[5293.70 → 5295.06] good extras on float plane right
[5295.06 → 5297.12] now, by the way, uh, this is an
[5297.12 → 5298.70] early access video that's coming up
[5298.70 → 5299.50] this weekend.
[5299.74 → 5300.46] What happened?
[5301.40 → 5301.66] Nope.
[5302.36 → 5304.06] Uh, this is an early access video
[5304.06 → 5305.34] that's coming up this weekend.
[5305.68 → 5307.78] Uh, sports branded tech products
[5307.78 → 5309.44] are a pretty bad deal.
[5309.58 → 5310.50] I just watched the intro.
[5310.64 → 5311.10] It's great.
[5311.34 → 5312.14] It's perfect.
[5312.24 → 5312.38] Okay.
[5312.42 → 5313.24] We can show the intro.
[5313.46 → 5314.10] Oh, you don't have to.
[5314.10 → 5314.28] Yeah.
[5314.40 → 5314.70] Okay.
[5316.70 → 5317.18] Nope.
[5318.00 → 5318.92] No sound.
[5319.62 → 5320.42] Sports ball.
[5320.90 → 5321.66] Boom brand touchdown.
[5321.66 → 5324.48] Between the pipes was great.
[5326.82 → 5328.16] And then just immediate.
[5332.58 → 5334.64] It's so relatable because the second
[5334.64 → 5336.24] you pulled those onto screen, I had
[5336.24 → 5337.16] the same reaction.
[5337.40 → 5338.76] I was like, Oh, what are those?
[5339.22 → 5339.84] You know what?
[5339.88 → 5341.44] That's actually part of our intro
[5341.44 → 5341.84] laws.
[5342.08 → 5343.74] Uh, we've been working on how to write
[5343.74 → 5345.30] better intros lately with the writing
[5345.30 → 5345.68] team.
[5345.68 → 5349.26] And, uh, one of the laws is that the
[5349.26 → 5351.62] first 20 seconds has to contain
[5351.62 → 5353.18] something that makes it broadly
[5353.18 → 5355.46] relatable because no matter what it
[5355.46 → 5358.50] is, whether it's a 25-year-old voodoo
[5358.50 → 5361.34] brick, say for example.
[5361.50 → 5363.76] Oh my, that's actually pretty cool.
[5363.88 → 5364.66] I'm excited for that.
[5364.92 → 5366.42] Uh, whether it's something like that
[5366.42 → 5369.34] or whether it's a brand-new graphics
[5369.34 → 5370.96] card just released, $1,600.
[5370.96 → 5374.64] We have to find some way to make it
[5374.64 → 5375.10] relatable.
[5375.38 → 5377.66] So with the voodoo brick, say
[5377.66 → 5378.82] hypothetically, if we were going to
[5378.82 → 5380.72] make a video about that, a way to
[5380.72 → 5382.56] make it relatable might be to tie it
[5382.56 → 5385.32] into the evolution of multi-GPU
[5385.32 → 5387.58] technology over the years, where it
[5387.58 → 5391.52] came from, uh, what it became, where
[5391.52 → 5393.80] we think it's going because multi-GPU
[5393.80 → 5395.28] is not gone.
[5395.66 → 5395.78] Yeah.
[5395.82 → 5397.06] And it's coming back stronger than
[5397.06 → 5397.36] ever.
[5397.60 → 5398.40] Mark my words.
[5398.40 → 5399.88] And we make a really strong argument
[5399.88 → 5400.78] for that in the video.
[5401.42 → 5401.64] Yeah.
[5401.86 → 5405.46] Anyway, um, or with the $1,600 GPU, I
[5405.46 → 5408.70] mean, most people will never own that.
[5409.00 → 5409.14] Yeah.
[5409.20 → 5410.24] That's not opinion.
[5410.32 → 5410.98] That's a fact.
[5411.08 → 5412.92] Most people will never own that GPU.
[5413.14 → 5413.26] For sure.
[5413.90 → 5416.64] But how can we make that more broadly
[5416.64 → 5417.26] relatable?
[5417.50 → 5419.40] Well, we can talk about how the
[5419.40 → 5420.94] performance and the features that
[5420.94 → 5423.08] we're seeing here first and are
[5423.08 → 5425.16] excited about here first are going to
[5425.16 → 5426.56] make their way down to lower price
[5426.56 → 5428.80] points until, you know, whether it's
[5428.80 → 5430.92] two or three or five years down the
[5430.92 → 5433.94] line, it will be attainable to most
[5433.94 → 5434.28] people.
[5434.42 → 5436.50] And really us covering this card is us
[5436.50 → 5438.32] just showing it to you early.
[5438.54 → 5439.74] You could think of it that way.
[5440.26 → 5441.94] Um, so I think that's, you know, the
[5441.94 → 5443.92] angle that we would take if we were to
[5443.92 → 5445.70] make a video about micro LED
[5445.70 → 5448.08] technology, which I am also really
[5448.08 → 5450.70] hoping to do soon, but nothing's, uh,
[5450.70 → 5452.14] nothing's actually locked in on that.
[5453.20 → 5453.84] Uh, right.
[5453.90 → 5455.10] The last thing I had wanted to show you
[5455.10 → 5456.50] guys over on float plane is that we've
[5456.50 → 5458.58] got a really great series of
[5458.58 → 5460.00] exclusives going on right now.
[5460.20 → 5462.16] This one's called their first time.
[5462.30 → 5463.34] I enjoy those.
[5463.44 → 5463.80] Those are great.
[5463.80 → 5465.72] Uh, Nick and Colton react to their
[5465.72 → 5467.14] first times on camera.
[5467.26 → 5467.90] Really cool.
[5468.08 → 5470.48] We've got extras from the working for
[5470.48 → 5471.00] LEG.
[5471.14 → 5473.38] So these are full, I believe uncut.
[5473.46 → 5474.62] I haven't watched them because I'm not
[5474.62 → 5476.58] allowed, but I believe they're uncut
[5476.58 → 5478.46] interviews, uh, from that video.
[5478.46 → 5479.96] So you guys can, can watch through
[5479.96 → 5481.06] those if you want, if you're over on
[5481.06 → 5483.74] float plane, uh, platforms that that's
[5483.74 → 5485.14] another, that's another popular
[5485.14 → 5487.62] punching bag for haters is how much
[5487.62 → 5488.12] we suck.
[5488.38 → 5488.74] Oh yeah.
[5488.78 → 5490.10] And how bad float plane is.
[5490.14 → 5491.22] There's like, there's a post on
[5491.22 → 5492.94] Reddit right now with like 1500 up
[5492.94 → 5494.02] votes or something like that about
[5494.02 → 5496.18] how awful float plane is and how we're
[5496.18 → 5497.38] failures and whatever.
[5497.38 → 5500.42] It's like, um, you can actually, you
[5500.42 → 5501.32] can actually do the math.
[5501.32 → 5502.62] There's some, I mean, there is some
[5502.62 → 5503.90] fair criticisms in there.
[5504.18 → 5504.62] Absolutely.
[5505.08 → 5505.46] For sure.
[5505.70 → 5508.08] However, one of the criticisms could
[5508.08 → 5509.58] have been dealt with if they had just
[5509.58 → 5510.48] clicked the link in the video
[5510.48 → 5512.08] description, which does take them to
[5512.08 → 5513.80] the page that has the pricing and has
[5513.80 → 5514.32] the content.
[5514.42 → 5516.02] So we actually realized that there is
[5516.02 → 5516.96] an issue with that.
[5517.08 → 5518.74] So that is completely true.
[5518.92 → 5520.98] Oh, but if you view it on a mobile
[5520.98 → 5523.72] phone, so not in the app, but on a
[5523.72 → 5525.24] mobile phone, it collapses it and you
[5525.24 → 5525.96] can't see the pricing.
[5526.44 → 5528.94] Oh, so we're like, Oh, so we'll, we'll
[5528.94 → 5529.24] fix it.
[5529.28 → 5531.44] So shout out, we will fix that, but it
[5531.44 → 5532.26] is not a failure.
[5532.80 → 5534.88] And that's not just, you know, huffing
[5534.88 → 5535.28] opium.
[5535.64 → 5538.40] It is actually not a failure because it
[5538.40 → 5540.26] actually generates millions of dollars a
[5540.26 → 5542.74] year in revenue, which is more than what
[5542.74 → 5545.72] most of the haters have done.
[5546.34 → 5546.48] Yeah.
[5546.48 → 5547.76] And like, we know the front page sucks.
[5548.14 → 5549.30] We're just focused on other stuff.
[5549.44 → 5550.72] We will make the front page better.
[5551.04 → 5552.60] And at least lately we've been showing
[5552.60 → 5554.24] off new features often enough that
[5554.24 → 5555.62] people actually believe us that we're
[5555.62 → 5556.40] working on other stuff.
[5556.44 → 5557.34] Yeah, that's nice.
[5558.32 → 5560.00] We really were working on the other
[5560.00 → 5560.68] stuff before.
[5561.08 → 5563.20] It wasn't really showable.
[5563.28 → 5563.58] It's hard.
[5563.58 → 5564.06] But it is now.
[5564.44 → 5566.52] I really like the I know we literally
[5566.52 → 5569.36] just talked about it, but okay.
[5569.46 → 5571.90] So the, the little arrow that you guys
[5571.90 → 5573.40] saw next to the channel where you could
[5573.40 → 5575.62] expand and, and, uh, contract the
[5575.62 → 5577.84] sub channels that used to be attached to
[5577.84 → 5579.22] clicking the channel at all.
[5579.64 → 5582.50] And, and Jaden got it in today so that
[5582.50 → 5583.92] you can just click the arrow separately.
[5583.92 → 5586.04] And now it's like a fidget toy for me.
[5586.14 → 5588.16] I just sit here and expand and contract
[5588.16 → 5589.84] and expand all the time.
[5589.92 → 5590.16] I don't know.
[5590.16 → 5591.52] We're going to keep, we're going to keep
[5591.52 → 5592.96] working on quality of life features.
[5593.10 → 5595.24] Uh, this is a really cool, uh, just
[5595.24 → 5596.38] message I happen to be looking at
[5596.38 → 5597.04] float plane chat.
[5597.42 → 5599.94] TJ Ford, uh, 10, 11 says I've been
[5599.94 → 5601.82] experimenting with using AI tools to
[5601.82 → 5603.38] assist with building customer websites
[5603.38 → 5603.84] faster.
[5605.24 → 5607.54] Is that something I should disclose to
[5607.54 → 5608.10] the customer?
[5609.34 → 5613.58] Oh, uh, does a carpenter have to say
[5613.58 → 5615.18] what brand of saw they used?
[5615.30 → 5616.46] Yeah, I don't think so.
[5616.72 → 5620.36] Unless if, if you are using anything,
[5620.36 → 5624.04] uh, private that you are giving to this
[5624.04 → 5627.80] AI tool, and it is an externally ran tool
[5628.48 → 5630.40] that could be like a data privacy issue.
[5631.12 → 5632.48] So if you're using, like if you're
[5632.48 → 5634.04] feeding it customer data, or you're
[5634.04 → 5635.92] feeding it, uh, things that are covered
[5635.92 → 5638.08] under an NDA or a non or any other,
[5638.62 → 5640.12] you need to be very careful about that.
[5640.36 → 5643.36] But if you're just using a better
[5643.36 → 5645.28] hammer than the other guy, whatever,
[5645.46 → 5646.56] if you're like, Oh, I need to make
[5646.56 → 5648.16] some button that does something and
[5648.16 → 5649.22] I want you to help me do it.
[5649.22 → 5649.90] And it helps you do it.
[5649.90 → 5650.68] Like, well, who cares?
[5650.72 → 5651.58] You don't have to disclose.
[5651.58 → 5652.36] That's the way I see it.
[5652.36 → 5654.16] That would actually be like weird to
[5654.16 → 5655.22] disclose in my opinion.
[5655.74 → 5657.34] Like if your contractor was like, by the
[5657.34 → 5659.82] way, just thought you knew.
[5659.98 → 5660.20] Yeah.
[5660.44 → 5661.08] I use, yeah.
[5661.80 → 5662.52] What was that?
[5662.76 → 5663.84] It's a Bob's Burgers reference.
[5663.98 → 5664.30] Okay.
[5665.30 → 5667.48] I was going to say like DeWalt or something.
[5667.68 → 5667.78] Yeah.
[5667.78 → 5669.42] Teddy has a as a McCracklin hammer.
[5669.54 → 5670.82] It defeats Bob's knife.
[5671.52 → 5672.76] His Fujiyama knife.
[5673.14 → 5674.26] I think that was the brand.
[5674.32 → 5674.74] It doesn't matter.
[5674.80 → 5675.26] I don't know.
[5675.46 → 5675.70] Anyway.
[5676.00 → 5677.14] But yeah, if it's something like that,
[5677.16 → 5678.16] I'd be like, why are you telling me?
[5678.22 → 5678.72] I don't care.
[5679.08 → 5679.26] Yeah.
[5679.72 → 5681.62] But you do care about our sponsors.
[5682.40 → 5684.90] The show is brought to you today by Messi.
[5685.20 → 5686.66] Do you enjoy wet feet?
[5687.08 → 5687.90] Well, I don't.
[5688.28 → 5689.36] I enjoy Messi.
[5689.92 → 5693.30] Messi says their shoes, 100% waterproof.
[5693.50 → 5693.82] Puddles?
[5694.22 → 5694.74] Fear not.
[5695.04 → 5696.88] You can walk on them like no one's business.
[5697.32 → 5699.60] Their Demoted technology keeps their shoes light
[5699.60 → 5702.76] and breathable while still being stretchy and comfortable.
[5702.76 → 5705.60] And do you want to bring extra pairs with you on vacation?
[5706.14 → 5707.18] Well, no problem.
[5707.50 → 5708.56] Because of their stretchiness,
[5708.72 → 5711.04] you can easily pack your Versus into your backpack.
[5711.46 → 5713.10] And we didn't even mention how light they are.
[5713.26 → 5714.06] They're super light.
[5714.48 → 5716.24] So rain or shine, here or there,
[5716.50 → 5719.16] it's always a great occasion to wear a pair of Versus.

[5731.26 → 5733.50] but we don't go farther than our parking lot
[5733.50 → 5736.44] and the benches next to our building.
[5736.62 → 5738.20] That was where that other shot was from.
[5739.88 → 5741.14] I mean, we're in Vancouver.
[5741.42 → 5743.54] Look, we don't have to go far to get rainy.
[5743.94 → 5744.48] Yeah, puddles.

[5871.78 → 5872.52] Live, laugh, low.
[5874.14 → 5874.58] Okay.
[5875.70 → 5876.62] Merch messages.
[5876.62 → 5878.34] There's supposed to be three of them.
[5878.50 → 5879.34] Okay, Dan, hit me.
[5882.06 → 5883.00] Okay, let's see.
[5883.14 → 5885.60] Sorry, you have to give me some time in between these.
[5885.60 → 5886.42] You put the...
[5886.42 → 5887.76] Yeah, you're the one who put it there.
[5887.76 → 5889.16] I know, I'm new at this.
[5890.18 → 5891.22] It's a new system.
[5891.66 → 5893.22] All right, a couple merch messages.
[5893.88 → 5894.28] You're new.
[5894.60 → 5895.22] Yeah, I am.
[5895.80 → 5896.20] Luke.
[5896.28 → 5896.58] Got him.
[5896.58 → 5900.52] How do you handle having your boss also be your landlord?
[5900.52 → 5903.18] I am beginning to have problems crop up
[5903.18 → 5906.18] because of this like being held to different standards
[5906.18 → 5907.00] than my coworkers.
[5907.58 → 5908.30] Oh, interesting.
[5909.26 → 5910.32] Be better.
[5910.64 → 5911.66] No, I am...
[5911.66 → 5912.38] Wow.
[5913.34 → 5913.86] Toxic.
[5915.38 → 5916.44] I don't know.
[5918.04 → 5919.02] I mean...
[5919.02 → 5920.66] Are you sure that's what's happening?
[5921.00 → 5924.88] Or is this something that your brain is just running with?
[5925.76 → 5926.54] I mean, it could be.
[5926.86 → 5928.14] It might also be happening.
[5928.14 → 5931.14] I'm not saying it's not, but like...
[5932.26 → 5934.04] Because like I could see that power dynamic
[5934.04 → 5937.52] making the boss slash landlord feel like
[5937.52 → 5938.88] they could push this person harder
[5938.88 → 5940.96] knowing that there's no escape from them.
[5941.20 → 5942.72] That could absolutely happen.
[5942.92 → 5945.28] There's also a level of shared frustrations.
[5945.98 → 5946.32] Yeah.
[5946.82 → 5948.42] Where like if they're...
[5948.42 → 5949.68] Not taking care of the lawn
[5949.68 → 5951.46] when that was explicitly part of the deal
[5951.46 → 5952.82] for their low rent, for example.
[5954.64 → 5956.60] Which generates complaints from the neighbours.
[5956.60 → 5958.28] How could you?
[5959.86 → 5962.42] That could bleed into, you know,
[5962.50 → 5963.96] shared frustrations at work and stuff.
[5964.02 → 5964.56] Yeah, it could.
[5972.40 → 5973.38] But yeah, I don't know.
[5973.48 → 5974.72] So that's...
[5974.72 → 5976.12] It could be totally legit,
[5976.26 → 5978.50] but I do think you need to evaluate the situation
[5978.50 → 5980.78] and make sure that you're not making it a thing
[5980.78 → 5982.14] that it isn't at the same time.
[5982.14 → 5984.66] Because that is a relatively common thing
[5984.66 → 5985.82] in these types of dynamics
[5985.82 → 5987.34] where you feel like you're being persecuted
[5987.34 → 5989.10] for something when you might not be.
[5989.34 → 5991.74] And I'd always recommend talking to people.
[5992.24 → 5993.38] Start with an statement.
[5993.60 → 5995.88] I know it's like cringe or whatever,
[5996.08 → 5997.76] high school counsellor stuff,
[5997.90 → 5999.96] but start with I feel
[5999.96 → 6002.06] and get it out there.
[6002.10 → 6003.54] Because if you don't get it out there,
[6003.60 → 6006.04] you can't expect it to magically resolve itself.
[6006.22 → 6007.94] Even if they're doing this on purpose,
[6008.56 → 6009.94] hey, at least it's good to know.
[6009.94 → 6011.26] Get the closure, right?
[6011.28 → 6012.30] And be open to the idea
[6012.30 → 6014.28] that you don't really have the whole story.
[6015.78 → 6018.46] So like let them explain their side of it as well.
[6018.54 → 6019.72] And hope that they'll be open
[6019.72 → 6020.84] to hearing your side as well,
[6020.90 → 6021.92] because that's what it takes
[6021.92 → 6023.26] to have a functional relationship.
[6023.38 → 6025.78] I'm assuming you're relatively close to this person,
[6025.92 → 6027.90] considering they are your boss and landlord.
[6028.10 → 6029.72] So the fact that they agreed to both
[6029.72 → 6031.06] or you agreed to both or something
[6031.06 → 6032.30] is probably not just chance.
[6032.32 → 6033.86] There was probably an okay relationship
[6033.86 → 6035.24] at some point, I would guess.
[6035.36 → 6037.16] Yeah, so you can probably get back there.
[6037.16 → 6039.60] Unless you work at like Foxconn or something.
[6039.60 → 6043.20] And you're like living in their like on-site dormitories
[6043.20 → 6043.68] or whatever.
[6044.04 → 6046.68] We're assuming that this is like a Western arrangement.
[6046.92 → 6047.68] Yes, that's fair.
[6047.86 → 6048.30] All right, what's next?
[6049.16 → 6049.80] Okay, next up.
[6049.92 → 6050.40] Howdy, LTT.
[6050.88 → 6051.92] My friends have discovered
[6051.92 → 6054.62] that each of us makes a dismissive comment
[6054.62 → 6056.90] or gesture whenever they want to switch topics.
[6057.32 → 6058.68] I.e., wow, that's crazy.
[6058.80 → 6060.02] Or just a head shake.
[6060.34 → 6062.22] Can you all call each other's out?
[6062.22 → 6067.26] I think both Luke and I are direct enough
[6067.26 → 6068.36] to just say,
[6068.48 → 6070.32] all righty then, moving on.
[6071.72 → 6074.02] Just change the topic of conversation.
[6074.26 → 6076.90] Yeah, I think our tell is telling the other person
[6076.90 → 6077.74] that we want to move on.
[6077.82 → 6079.12] Yeah, and our whole generation
[6079.12 → 6083.68] basically treats the emoji,
[6084.24 → 6085.26] like the single emoji
[6085.26 → 6088.00] as punctuation for the conversation.
[6088.00 → 6090.16] Like I think that's pretty well understood.
[6091.28 → 6092.42] Yeah, if you don't,
[6093.76 → 6095.08] I think reacting to it,
[6095.12 → 6097.00] because modern messaging systems have reacts.
[6097.10 → 6098.02] I guess that's the new one.
[6098.12 → 6099.24] That's less of a thing a bit.
[6099.50 → 6100.20] Oh, okay.
[6100.26 → 6102.34] I think if you send a whole message
[6102.34 → 6104.30] that is just like a thumbs up emoji,
[6104.46 → 6105.64] it's like, yeah, this is over.
[6106.90 → 6108.52] If you send just a React,
[6108.88 → 6110.38] I might interpret it that way,
[6110.44 → 6111.84] but I might also be wondering
[6111.84 → 6112.82] if you're going to do that
[6112.82 → 6114.36] and then send a message in response.
[6114.36 → 6119.30] I'm just trying to find like some examples of us just,
[6119.58 → 6123.36] okay, LOL, that's a good conversation termination.
[6124.32 → 6125.82] But that might not be like a
[6126.04 → 6127.70] I want to stop talking about this now
[6127.70 → 6128.72] and that might just be a
[6128.78 → 6129.86] I don't really have anything to add.
[6129.92 → 6131.62] No, because I have perfect examples here.
[6133.02 → 6134.36] Okay, so we were talking about
[6134.90 → 6137.98] the Valentine's party with AIs.
[6138.74 → 6138.94] Yeah.
[6139.08 → 6141.18] And then I basically go,
[6141.34 → 6142.96] yeah, so the party just took place
[6142.96 → 6144.10] with them interacting with each other.
[6144.10 → 6145.10] My brain is broke.
[6145.70 → 6147.76] Then I sent thinking of streaming today,
[6147.80 → 6149.00] but kind of feeling asocial
[6149.00 → 6152.40] and posted a picture of my bike painting thing.
[6152.76 → 6153.50] And then you said,
[6153.54 → 6154.88] you don't have to stream painting it.
[6154.96 → 6155.88] It could just be a stream
[6155.88 → 6157.20] and you could not interact with chat.
[6157.24 → 6158.38] And I said, well, I don't know what I'm doing.
[6158.44 → 6159.48] I was hoping chat could help.
[6159.60 → 6161.28] And you say, lol, well then.
[6162.46 → 6163.84] And that's the end of the conversation.
[6164.16 → 6165.78] Well, see, but that's one of those situations.
[6165.78 → 6166.90] Hold on, I have another one.
[6167.68 → 6168.76] Right before that,
[6168.94 → 6170.96] I message you and I say,
[6171.04 → 6172.50] oh, we were talking about the housing market.
[6172.50 → 6174.18] And you have that stick guy
[6174.18 → 6175.06] that's poking.
[6175.22 → 6176.06] Come on, do something.
[6176.74 → 6177.68] And I go, well,
[6177.70 → 6179.20] I'd just make sure you check out a house
[6179.20 → 6181.36] with someone who knows a fair bit about Reno,
[6181.42 → 6182.00] if you can.
[6182.08 → 6184.02] Might help recognize any corners they cut,
[6184.10 → 6185.66] but it'll still be impossible to say
[6185.66 → 6187.30] what they covered up or painted over.
[6187.56 → 6188.44] And you go, well,
[6188.56 → 6190.34] probably something, something,
[6190.58 → 6191.28] some stuff.
[6192.20 → 6192.94] And I go,
[6193.02 → 6194.64] it doesn't hurt to keep your eye on things.
[6194.86 → 6195.40] Hurts a little.
[6195.40 → 6196.72] And you go, yeah, lol.
[6197.48 → 6198.76] And the conversation's over.
[6199.36 → 6202.32] Yeah, I think lol is the ultimate conversation termination.
[6202.66 → 6204.26] It's not because I'm trying to terminate the conversation.
[6204.36 → 6205.68] I don't really have anything else to add.
[6205.86 → 6208.08] Right, but that's terminating the conversation.
[6208.40 → 6208.86] Yeah, fair enough.
[6209.04 → 6209.14] Yeah.
[6209.26 → 6209.92] But it's not like,
[6209.98 → 6211.90] I think what he's saying is
[6211.90 → 6215.14] they are like done with this conversation
[6215.14 → 6216.30] and want to move on.
[6216.90 → 6217.64] Well, I don't know.
[6217.72 → 6218.70] I think maybe it's,
[6218.70 → 6220.56] maybe it's Austin's own perception
[6220.56 → 6221.60] of the dismissiveness.
[6222.28 → 6223.16] Like to me,
[6223.50 → 6224.94] Luke's not being dismissive.
[6225.20 → 6227.24] He's just done talking about it.
[6227.60 → 6228.32] And that's okay.
[6228.60 → 6228.82] Yeah.
[6228.98 → 6229.98] Like I'm okay with that.
[6230.02 → 6231.32] I guess you got to be secure
[6231.32 → 6234.62] in being able to acknowledge
[6234.62 → 6235.58] that what you're talking about
[6235.58 → 6236.48] ain't that interesting.
[6236.96 → 6237.72] Or there's just, yeah,
[6237.76 → 6239.28] just nothing else to add necessarily.
[6239.54 → 6240.06] You know what?
[6240.14 → 6240.58] Oh man.
[6240.96 → 6243.04] So that kind of makes me think about
[6243.04 → 6244.40] how you and I used to complain
[6244.40 → 6245.86] about WAN show topics before.
[6246.08 → 6247.26] When people would go,
[6247.42 → 6248.80] wow, this is fascinating.
[6249.12 → 6250.72] And they'd put it in the WAN show doc
[6250.72 → 6251.80] and we'd go,
[6252.32 → 6253.20] this is not,
[6253.40 → 6254.32] it's interesting,
[6254.58 → 6256.58] but it is not a topic of conversation.
[6256.92 → 6257.70] It's like a statement.
[6258.16 → 6258.30] Yeah.
[6258.58 → 6259.80] It's not, yeah.
[6259.80 → 6260.82] It's a thing,
[6261.46 → 6264.44] but there's no real room to discuss it.
[6264.86 → 6266.60] And so maybe you need to recognize
[6266.60 → 6268.56] that sometimes you think something
[6268.56 → 6269.80] is a topic of conversation.
[6270.12 → 6271.40] Like, okay,
[6271.62 → 6275.62] I'd say parents are the classic
[6275.62 → 6278.02] thinking something is a topic of conversation
[6278.02 → 6280.06] when actually it's just a boring statement
[6280.06 → 6281.02] that no one cares about.
[6281.38 → 6281.62] You know,
[6282.04 → 6284.18] Timmy took his first steps today.
[6284.58 → 6284.90] Yeah.
[6285.30 → 6285.64] Okay.
[6285.74 → 6286.14] Okay.
[6286.42 → 6286.80] Cool.
[6288.70 → 6289.18] Hey,
[6289.38 → 6292.02] look at this funny thing Timmy said on video.
[6292.82 → 6293.08] Lol.
[6295.24 → 6296.44] That's not my kid.
[6297.16 → 6298.06] I don't give a shit,
[6298.26 → 6298.42] right?
[6298.52 → 6299.02] Like it's,
[6299.66 → 6299.98] no,
[6300.10 → 6300.34] no,
[6300.42 → 6301.00] I'm serious.
[6301.44 → 6301.96] Like I,
[6301.96 → 6302.22] I,
[6302.22 → 6303.86] I value a human,
[6303.98 → 6305.94] I assign value to a human life.
[6305.94 → 6306.94] I do.
[6307.26 → 6307.40] Yeah.
[6307.50 → 6310.44] That particular one is not any more
[6310.44 → 6311.72] or less interesting to me.
[6311.90 → 6312.82] If you have like a ton of interaction
[6312.82 → 6314.32] with that one in particular.
[6314.48 → 6314.76] Sure.
[6314.90 → 6315.38] Then maybe,
[6315.50 → 6315.66] yeah.
[6315.74 → 6318.22] But I'm talking the stereotypical parent
[6318.22 → 6319.10] who is just.
[6319.48 → 6320.66] never met this person's kid.
[6320.76 → 6321.12] Yes.
[6321.22 → 6321.44] Yeah.
[6321.66 → 6321.82] Yeah.
[6321.88 → 6321.96] Yeah.
[6321.96 → 6322.48] Exactly.
[6323.32 → 6323.84] No,
[6324.68 → 6325.98] I'm not a psychopath.
[6326.58 → 6327.16] I just,
[6327.28 → 6328.36] I,
[6328.42 → 6330.12] I just don't have a connection
[6330.12 → 6330.70] to all.
[6330.88 → 6331.58] It's definitely.
[6331.92 → 6333.58] 8 billion or however many people
[6333.58 → 6334.44] there are on the earth.
[6334.58 → 6335.62] This is definitely a thing.
[6336.44 → 6337.20] Being a psychopath.
[6337.46 → 6337.64] No.
[6338.14 → 6338.42] Oh.
[6338.58 → 6338.74] No,
[6338.86 → 6339.10] no,
[6339.10 → 6339.22] no,
[6339.22 → 6339.34] no,
[6339.34 → 6339.44] no.
[6339.62 → 6341.04] I thought it was being a sociopath.
[6341.86 → 6342.28] I mean,
[6342.36 → 6342.96] no,
[6343.06 → 6343.68] that's okay.
[6343.86 → 6344.38] So no,
[6344.54 → 6344.70] no,
[6344.72 → 6346.46] it's also not being a sociopath.
[6346.78 → 6347.46] Like I said,
[6347.52 → 6349.26] I do assign value to human life.
[6349.34 → 6350.40] I do have emotions.
[6350.88 → 6352.52] I just don't,
[6352.60 → 6352.72] I,
[6352.72 → 6353.18] I just,
[6353.26 → 6355.24] I don't have the emotional bandwidth
[6355.24 → 6357.70] to be that invested
[6357.70 → 6359.84] in more than a handful of lives.
[6359.84 → 6361.80] I have not a lot of friends,
[6361.98 → 6363.06] but the ones that I have
[6363.06 → 6364.68] are extremely close
[6364.68 → 6365.74] and extremely dear.
[6365.90 → 6368.04] And I just don't have the brain space.
[6368.24 → 6368.48] I mean,
[6368.48 → 6370.16] maybe this is just an ADHD thing
[6370.16 → 6370.96] at a certain point
[6370.96 → 6372.90] because I can only pay attention
[6372.90 → 6373.92] to so many things.
[6373.92 → 6375.30] I think it's also very normal though.
[6375.42 → 6376.46] And I think a lot of people
[6376.46 → 6377.38] that would go against
[6377.38 → 6377.98] what you're saying
[6377.98 → 6379.04] in public settings
[6379.04 → 6380.84] might not actually feel
[6381.36 → 6382.64] against it inside.
[6383.28 → 6383.56] Right.
[6383.90 → 6384.72] So I'm just saying
[6384.72 → 6385.62] the quiet part out loud.
[6385.66 → 6386.52] I think a little bit.
[6386.82 → 6387.22] Yeah.
[6387.34 → 6388.14] I think that,
[6388.24 → 6388.78] I think so.
[6389.26 → 6389.42] Yeah.
[6389.42 → 6391.60] So I'm going to keep doing my loss.
[6391.72 → 6393.24] I don't consider it dismissive.
[6393.48 → 6395.12] I just consider it.
[6395.12 → 6395.30] It's not,
[6395.38 → 6397.06] you're not terminating the conversation.
[6397.18 → 6398.10] It's not anything to add.
[6398.20 → 6398.36] Yeah.
[6398.50 → 6399.38] Oh my God.
[6399.48 → 6399.78] Every,
[6400.20 → 6400.48] wow.
[6400.52 → 6401.42] Now that I'm aware of it,
[6401.60 → 6402.86] every time we talk,
[6402.86 → 6404.48] you end the conversation with lol.
[6404.82 → 6408.06] This is three in a freaking row here.
[6409.28 → 6409.72] Oh,
[6409.80 → 6410.94] I ended one with a JFC.
[6411.98 → 6412.20] Okay.
[6412.60 → 6412.98] Yeah.
[6412.98 → 6413.26] Which is,
[6413.32 → 6414.74] I'd say an equally just,
[6414.84 → 6416.36] it's essentially a reaction emoji.
[6416.98 → 6417.16] Yeah.
[6417.18 → 6417.34] Yeah.
[6417.46 → 6417.68] Okay.
[6417.68 → 6419.54] But there's often things we'll say to each other
[6419.54 → 6420.74] or share with each other that like,
[6421.00 → 6422.66] there isn't necessarily a conversation to be had.
[6422.72 → 6422.80] Yeah.
[6422.84 → 6423.26] And we're like,
[6423.34 → 6423.70] honestly,
[6424.08 → 6424.68] like honestly,
[6424.68 → 6427.68] I'm busy right now, and I don't have time to sit and text with you for 20 minutes.
[6427.78 → 6427.94] Yeah.
[6427.94 → 6428.04] It's just,
[6428.30 → 6429.00] I saw this.
[6429.06 → 6429.32] Ha ha.
[6429.56 → 6429.76] Yeah.
[6429.86 → 6430.22] See you later.
[6430.34 → 6431.22] That's all it really needs.
[6431.44 → 6431.86] I don't know.
[6431.86 → 6434.48] You'll take however much time with it, you want.
[6434.54 → 6435.16] I don't really care.
[6435.60 → 6435.82] Dan,
[6435.86 → 6436.24] I'm lost.
[6436.68 → 6436.88] Oh,
[6437.16 → 6437.84] there's no sign.
[6438.52 → 6439.44] I don't know what to do.
[6439.62 → 6440.60] You only did two.
[6440.80 → 6441.38] I don't know how to,
[6441.50 → 6441.70] oh,
[6441.80 → 6442.24] this show.
[6442.60 → 6443.14] Well then,
[6443.26 → 6444.68] the sign should still be there.
[6445.08 → 6446.34] He's going to put the sign back.
[6446.58 → 6446.64] Here,
[6446.72 → 6447.32] we can watch him.
[6447.50 → 6447.78] No,
[6447.84 → 6449.04] we're going to watch him put the sign back.
[6452.46 → 6453.26] So mad.
[6453.90 → 6454.50] There it is.
[6454.54 → 6454.94] There you go.
[6454.94 → 6455.28] All right.
[6455.34 → 6456.20] There's your sign.
[6456.34 → 6456.76] Hit me again.
[6457.56 → 6457.96] Hi,
[6458.08 → 6458.36] Luke.
[6459.14 → 6459.34] Hey,
[6459.42 → 6459.74] what's up?
[6460.28 → 6461.60] Did I broadcast this?
[6462.26 → 6462.86] Conversation's over.
[6462.94 → 6463.32] Forget it.
[6463.70 → 6464.04] Okay.
[6464.18 → 6465.14] Next merch message.
[6465.64 → 6466.00] Hi,
[6466.06 → 6466.18] Luke.
[6466.24 → 6470.32] I'm currently in networking class and I know that you guys have touched on this before,
[6470.32 → 6476.82] but I was wondering what are some of the larger costs of video streaming, and why are those costs so high?
[6477.78 → 6478.18] Bandwidth.
[6478.68 → 6479.56] Bandwidth is rough.
[6479.70 → 6479.82] Yeah,
[6479.82 → 6480.26] but why?
[6481.00 → 6482.10] That's what they want to know.
[6483.06 → 6483.54] Oh,
[6483.54 → 6486.30] who do you pay for bandwidth?
[6486.42 → 6487.80] Because they charge a lot.
[6487.96 → 6488.30] Uh,
[6488.34 → 6488.82] I don't know.
[6488.98 → 6489.02] I,
[6489.32 → 6494.06] you have to pay for transit across networks that other entities own is a big part of it.
[6494.14 → 6494.30] Yeah.
[6494.34 → 6496.24] And then like having good routes.
[6496.42 → 6497.92] So routes is like,
[6497.92 → 6498.80] uh,
[6498.88 → 6499.10] you,
[6499.20 → 6506.08] you might have a server who's like negotiated route to your house is fantastic.
[6506.36 → 6507.52] So if you watch a video,
[6507.52 → 6508.06] it's great,
[6508.06 → 6509.56] but the person down the street,
[6509.56 → 6511.50] you think it wouldn't be that different,
[6511.50 → 6513.18] but they might be on a different ISP.
[6513.54 → 6517.54] And the negotiated routes in your country might be poor for that.
[6517.54 → 6524.40] So like companies like YouTube have fantastic distribution everywhere with really,
[6524.40 → 6526.56] really great routes to basically everyone,
[6526.56 → 6529.20] but that's not that simple.
[6529.42 → 6529.98] Right.
[6529.98 → 6534.48] So like we do a bunch of our video distribution through Cloudflare.
[6534.56 → 6537.82] One of the reasons why we do that is because Cloudflare has very,
[6537.94 → 6540.44] very good global coverage all over the place.
[6540.52 → 6540.84] Right.
[6540.84 → 6541.22] We have,
[6541.22 → 6541.60] uh,
[6541.60 → 6543.64] this float VPN thing we've talked about before.
[6543.64 → 6545.06] Because we always like having fallbacks.
[6545.06 → 6545.86] That's part of float planes,
[6545.98 → 6547.00] whole thing.
[6547.00 → 6548.86] So we can fall back to our own setup,
[6548.92 → 6549.52] whatever we want,
[6549.80 → 6553.26] but to be able to get the amount of coverage to the amount of routes that we would have
[6553.26 → 6553.82] with Cloudflare,
[6553.90 → 6556.14] the scale that we would have to go to would be kind of crazy.
[6556.32 → 6557.02] It wouldn't make sense.
[6557.02 → 6557.38] By the way,
[6557.38 → 6558.02] is this broken?
[6558.18 → 6560.36] Kyle R's thing here is stuck here.
[6560.42 → 6563.00] He's holding it there because that's the question we're currently discussing.
[6563.68 → 6563.82] Oh,
[6563.88 → 6564.66] that's a cool feature.
[6565.00 → 6567.50] And it also pauses the queue so that,
[6567.50 → 6567.88] uh,
[6567.88 → 6569.38] other merch messages aren't getting lost.
[6569.46 → 6570.64] That's why you have the giant circle.
[6570.64 → 6572.64] I think that was entirely Conrad's idea.
[6573.46 → 6573.66] It's,
[6573.66 → 6574.48] it's really useful.
[6574.90 → 6575.12] Cool.
[6575.22 → 6575.70] It's pretty sweet.
[6575.80 → 6575.98] Okay.
[6576.34 → 6576.82] Um,
[6577.08 → 6577.84] but yeah,
[6577.84 → 6578.72] so like there,
[6578.78 → 6580.56] there's all these routes problems,
[6580.56 → 6582.38] but you would think you would think,
[6582.38 → 6584.66] and this is where it gets expensive and also complicated.
[6584.90 → 6585.98] We're with Cloudflare.
[6586.06 → 6588.34] They're one of the biggest internet companies there is.
[6588.42 → 6588.54] Yeah.
[6588.60 → 6588.80] Ever.
[6588.94 → 6590.88] We should have perfect coverage like everywhere.
[6591.02 → 6591.14] Right.
[6591.18 → 6591.30] Yeah.
[6591.34 → 6591.78] Yeah.
[6591.88 → 6592.08] Yeah.
[6592.16 → 6592.42] Hey,
[6592.48 → 6592.70] yeah.
[6592.70 → 6592.88] Why,
[6592.94 → 6593.36] why don't we?
[6593.48 → 6593.70] Nope.
[6594.36 → 6594.60] Oh,
[6595.10 → 6598.62] cause even Cloudflare doesn't have like perfect coverage to everywhere.
[6598.82 → 6600.62] There are certain places.
[6600.64 → 6601.72] There are certain places in Australia,
[6602.04 → 6602.32] surprise,
[6602.44 → 6603.92] surprise that have issues.
[6604.04 → 6604.44] We've,
[6604.50 → 6606.58] we've notoriously had some issues in Germany,
[6607.08 → 6608.74] certain routing problems in Germany.
[6608.86 → 6610.38] We just have lots of problems with it.
[6610.42 → 6614.70] Even when we're trying to feed through one of the biggest multi-billion dollar,
[6614.70 → 6618.40] like data distribution companies in the world,
[6618.52 → 6620.16] we still have problems there.
[6620.44 → 6620.86] Um,
[6620.86 → 6621.34] and we can,
[6621.42 → 6622.40] we can work on ourselves.
[6622.40 → 6622.96] We can,
[6623.08 → 6624.62] we can set up new partnerships.
[6624.62 → 6626.50] We can try to expand our partnership map,
[6626.58 → 6628.58] do a multi CDN thing so that if,
[6628.66 → 6630.54] if quality to somewhere is low,
[6630.54 → 6631.86] we switch over to some other CDN,
[6631.92 → 6632.42] all this type of stuff,
[6632.50 → 6633.38] there are ways to mitigate it.
[6633.38 → 6633.56] Yeah.
[6633.56 → 6634.00] Ramsey asks,
[6634.14 → 6635.76] I assumed you'd use Akamai for streaming.
[6635.94 → 6637.36] And I believe we can.
[6637.50 → 6637.90] We can.
[6638.06 → 6638.22] Yeah.
[6638.36 → 6639.98] But we have,
[6639.98 → 6642.32] there are a lot of costs agreements and other stuff going on.
[6642.34 → 6643.62] We have float plane CDN,
[6643.62 → 6649.78] but then we also have fallbacks to cheap CDNs and also expensive CDNs.
[6649.78 → 6654.28] And we can actually dynamically choose which one to use to deliver the content,
[6654.36 → 6657.20] depending on what's most favourable for the particular user.
[6657.34 → 6659.08] We don't always get it a hundred percent right,
[6659.22 → 6661.08] but the team tries really hard.
[6661.22 → 6662.38] Akamai is extremely expensive.
[6662.64 → 6663.42] It's really,
[6663.58 → 6664.04] perfect.
[6664.12 → 6665.08] Very high quality,
[6665.64 → 6666.50] but very expensive.
[6666.94 → 6667.06] Yeah.
[6667.06 → 6669.10] So we want to avoid that whenever we can,
[6669.22 → 6670.28] but we'll do it if we have to.
[6670.46 → 6670.70] Yep.
[6671.64 → 6672.42] Hit us one more time.
[6672.96 → 6673.22] Okay.
[6673.30 → 6673.46] Well,
[6673.50 → 6675.48] now we're going to move on to some potentials.
[6675.66 → 6678.06] So we've got a lot of these rapid fire to go through.
[6678.56 → 6678.74] Oh,
[6678.80 → 6679.04] okay.
[6679.04 → 6680.48] We can do some rapid fire.
[6680.60 → 6680.78] Sure.
[6680.92 → 6681.10] Yes.
[6681.12 → 6682.68] We have about 20 to do.
[6683.04 → 6684.76] We should have a timer for rapid fire.
[6684.82 → 6686.02] So that would actually be a good problem.
[6686.22 → 6686.66] That'd be cool.
[6687.74 → 6688.48] I'll make a note of that.
[6689.14 → 6689.50] Okay.
[6689.76 → 6691.74] My wife and I are not gamers,
[6691.74 → 6695.36] but we do have a laptop with a mobile 2080 and 32 gigs of Ram,
[6695.48 → 6697.60] as well as two Logitech controllers.
[6697.82 → 6698.26] Of course you do.
[6698.62 → 6700.52] What are some games we can play together?
[6700.70 → 6701.66] Aren't too expensive.
[6701.84 → 6702.42] Play it takes two.
[6704.30 → 6704.70] Classic.
[6705.54 → 6705.72] Hi,
[6705.78 → 6706.06] everyone.
[6706.30 → 6707.18] I've been trying to,
[6707.32 → 6707.44] yeah,
[6707.46 → 6708.08] portal's also great.
[6708.08 → 6708.44] Overcooked.
[6709.36 → 6709.76] Ah,
[6710.16 → 6711.00] Overcooked is great.
[6711.22 → 6711.36] Yeah,
[6711.40 → 6712.46] Overcooked is super casual.
[6714.56 → 6715.00] Hey,
[6715.26 → 6717.80] we should talk about that game we played at the retreat.
[6718.50 → 6719.14] Mage quit.
[6719.14 → 6719.86] Mage quit.
[6719.86 → 6721.46] Mage quit is so much fun.
[6721.62 → 6726.92] If you and seven friends want just like a chaotic arena brawler,
[6727.10 → 6728.70] don't practice.
[6729.06 → 6729.50] Don't.
[6729.66 → 6732.42] Don't like to train up because you'll be way too OP.
[6733.06 → 6734.10] And it actually won't be fun.
[6734.18 → 6734.30] Yeah,
[6734.42 → 6740.60] go in all of you cold, and it'll be like the most fun you've had gaming in at least six months.
[6740.60 → 6741.06] I promise.
[6741.30 → 6741.86] I haven't,
[6741.86 → 6746.30] I haven't like bounced around and cheered that much for a game in a very long time.
[6746.30 → 6747.10] That was really fun.
[6747.10 → 6748.08] Since the whale land,
[6748.14 → 6748.84] to be completely honest.
[6748.92 → 6749.56] Cause that's what,
[6749.80 → 6750.78] that's what it's all about.
[6750.82 → 6751.04] Yeah.
[6751.26 → 6752.34] Even playing field.
[6753.34 → 6753.74] Upsets.
[6753.88 → 6754.82] Anyone could win it.
[6754.82 → 6755.20] And like,
[6755.26 → 6756.54] it was so much fun,
[6756.72 → 6757.72] especially at like,
[6757.96 → 6760.64] one of my favourite moments was really early on when we like,
[6760.74 → 6762.66] still nobody had any idea what they're doing.
[6762.74 → 6765.14] And you see two people who it's like,
[6765.30 → 6766.52] everybody else is,
[6766.52 → 6769.00] is knocked out or dead or whatever it is in that game.
[6769.10 → 6770.06] There's two of them left.
[6770.38 → 6770.74] Clearly,
[6770.74 → 6772.00] neither of them knows what they're doing,
[6772.00 → 6774.78] but they're like fumbling around trying to figure it out.
[6774.82 → 6775.84] And they're whiffing.
[6776.00 → 6776.80] And it's just,
[6776.94 → 6779.12] you see them whiff and something blows up the wall.
[6779.26 → 6781.12] We don't know how one of the abilities works yet.
[6781.12 → 6782.48] So we think they can avoid it,
[6782.50 → 6783.40] but they actually can't.
[6783.42 → 6784.88] So we're all like cheering for them to avoid it.
[6784.92 → 6785.80] And then they get obliterated,
[6785.94 → 6786.12] man.
[6786.54 → 6787.04] It was,
[6787.28 → 6788.38] it was very fun.
[6788.48 → 6788.96] There's no,
[6789.04 → 6790.82] like we have never talked to them.
[6790.88 → 6791.84] There's no agreement or anything.
[6791.84 → 6792.28] We just,
[6792.56 → 6793.74] a bunch of us played it.
[6793.94 → 6794.18] Yeah.
[6794.28 → 6795.36] And it was very entertaining.
[6795.36 → 6797.92] We had an exec retreat, and I was,
[6798.00 → 6798.36] I,
[6798.48 → 6799.24] I,
[6799.38 → 6801.80] I think wisely packed eight,
[6801.80 → 6802.44] controllers.
[6802.72 → 6803.10] It was pretty sweet.
[6803.16 → 6804.00] The DOG ally,
[6804.54 → 6807.18] an external GPU and a long HDMI cable.
[6807.18 → 6807.80] And I was like,
[6807.80 → 6810.54] if all else goes to absolute shit,
[6810.82 → 6811.54] at least we can play some,
[6811.54 → 6813.32] at least we can play some video games,
[6813.32 → 6813.96] uh,
[6814.04 → 6814.86] during the night.
[6814.86 → 6816.28] And it was a good call.
[6816.36 → 6819.62] I knew because I'm very wise and a good leader.
[6819.82 → 6820.26] No,
[6820.32 → 6820.92] but seriously,
[6820.92 → 6821.36] I,
[6821.46 → 6822.24] I gambled,
[6822.56 → 6822.92] um,
[6822.92 → 6826.38] that the best thing to do would be to find a game that nobody had played.
[6826.46 → 6830.74] So I just was digging around trying to find eight player local multiplayer games,
[6830.74 → 6833.14] which is shockingly hard to do in the new steam,
[6833.20 → 6834.80] big picture interface valve.
[6834.94 → 6835.52] Come on.
[6836.02 → 6836.30] It's,
[6836.30 → 6836.56] it was,
[6836.64 → 6837.58] it's uncrossable.
[6837.82 → 6838.20] Go ahead.
[6838.30 → 6838.80] Go try,
[6839.06 → 6840.52] go try to browse local multiplayer.
[6840.52 → 6840.84] You,
[6840.96 → 6842.90] you actually more than eight,
[6843.02 → 6843.82] more than four players,
[6843.94 → 6845.62] like accessing custom tags.
[6845.62 → 6847.50] And we figured out some of them was like,
[6847.56 → 6847.80] okay,
[6847.80 → 6849.62] it's four players locally.
[6850.00 → 6851.50] You can connect for other players,
[6851.56 → 6854.18] but they have to be like external clients or whatever.
[6854.52 → 6854.70] Mage,
[6854.86 → 6857.72] Mage quit actually worked with seven people local,
[6857.84 → 6857.98] eight,
[6858.32 → 6858.74] eight people.
[6858.74 → 6859.18] Sorry.
[6859.46 → 6859.58] Yeah.
[6859.70 → 6859.82] So,
[6859.82 → 6860.22] um,
[6860.22 → 6860.48] yeah.
[6860.48 → 6860.64] So,
[6860.70 → 6860.84] yeah.
[6860.84 → 6861.40] So I,
[6861.44 → 6862.08] I was like,
[6862.14 → 6862.46] yeah,
[6862.60 → 6863.28] this will be,
[6863.44 → 6864.22] this will be the activity.
[6864.22 → 6864.64] And I was like,
[6864.68 → 6864.90] yes,
[6864.92 → 6865.46] it was awesome.
[6865.58 → 6865.82] It was.
[6865.94 → 6867.18] And the steam room was great too,
[6867.24 → 6867.60] actually,
[6868.28 → 6869.02] or sauna rather.
[6869.10 → 6870.00] I guess it's more of a sauna.
[6870.30 → 6870.62] Okay.
[6870.62 → 6870.92] Sorry.
[6871.04 → 6871.60] Hit us again.
[6871.60 → 6872.90] That was not that rapid fire.
[6872.90 → 6873.42] We'll do better.
[6873.54 → 6873.88] That's good.
[6873.96 → 6874.38] Good answer.
[6874.86 → 6875.22] Hi everyone.
[6875.30 → 6877.56] I've been trying to properly engineer my water loop,
[6877.64 → 6881.58] but struggle to find data such as head loss and heat load for radiators easily.
[6881.70 → 6883.40] Will this be something the labs could test?
[6883.98 → 6884.62] Probably not.
[6884.62 → 6885.42] Um,
[6885.42 → 6889.06] because it's not really like a fixed function equation.
[6889.72 → 6890.16] Um,
[6890.44 → 6898.62] your tolerance for the temperatures of your devices could allow you to run a lower cooling capacity
[6898.62 → 6899.26] radiator,
[6899.26 → 6900.06] uh,
[6900.06 → 6901.60] and still be comfortable with it.
[6901.96 → 6903.28] So say for example,
[6903.28 → 6907.28] you were comfortable with your devices running at 90 degrees on water.
[6907.82 → 6908.24] Well,
[6908.42 → 6909.66] good news for you.
[6909.96 → 6915.40] You can use a small radiator with slow fans, and you're good to go.
[6915.56 → 6917.06] It just means that your water,
[6917.18 → 6919.20] your coolant temperature will be higher,
[6919.38 → 6921.02] which is going to make it,
[6921.44 → 6921.90] um,
[6922.30 → 6926.78] less effective at pulling heat off of your CPU or your GPU.
[6926.78 → 6929.78] The good thing about that is the hotter the water gets,
[6929.92 → 6932.94] the more effective the heat exchange is with the air.
[6933.66 → 6939.26] So you might be a different kind of user who wants to see 65 degree load temperatures
[6939.26 → 6942.60] with super low RPM fans as well.
[6942.64 → 6943.52] In which case I'm going to tell you,
[6943.58 → 6943.68] okay,
[6943.74 → 6945.84] well you're going to need probably about eight to 10,
[6946.14 → 6947.52] 120 millimetre rads.
[6947.62 → 6948.54] So let's go.
[6948.98 → 6949.30] Um,
[6949.62 → 6951.06] yeah,
[6951.12 → 6951.50] it really,
[6951.58 → 6952.46] it really just depends.
[6952.62 → 6953.36] It depends on your,
[6953.46 → 6953.86] on your,
[6953.94 → 6954.60] on your tolerance.
[6954.60 → 6960.74] I would say that the general rule of thumb used to be a single one 20 millimeters per
[6960.74 → 6961.96] heat generating component.
[6961.96 → 6963.08] So if you had three,
[6963.08 → 6965.02] a CPU and two GPUs,
[6965.02 → 6966.40] you'd want a triple one 20 mid.
[6966.78 → 6969.44] I would say that's probably out the window these days.
[6969.44 → 6975.26] And it's more like a one 40 millimetre per heat generating component or about one and a
[6975.26 → 6977.84] half one twenty per heat generating component.
[6978.00 → 6980.88] And then if you have lower tolerance for noise,
[6980.88 → 6983.70] then you're going to want to go a little heavier than that.
[6983.70 → 6983.90] Yeah.
[6984.02 → 6984.80] As for the pump,
[6985.14 → 6985.84] get a D five.
[6987.96 → 6988.84] That's the answer.
[6989.68 → 6991.76] Lang D five or some rebrand of it.
[6992.06 → 6993.16] Someone did clarify.
[6993.30 → 6995.16] Apparently mage fight goes up to 10.
[6995.36 → 6995.80] Mage quit.
[6996.04 → 6997.86] Mage quit goes up to 10 local players.
[6997.88 → 6998.02] Oh,
[6998.06 → 6998.52] well that's great.
[6998.60 → 6999.54] I only brought eight controllers,
[6999.68 → 7000.74] so I didn't think to check that,
[7000.90 → 7003.28] but if our exec team grows and,
[7003.36 → 7004.94] or everyone is able to make it next time,
[7005.00 → 7006.02] we're ready to go.
[7006.20 → 7006.92] Let's play some mage quit.
[7007.00 → 7007.96] Nobody better practice.
[7007.96 → 7009.74] Because that would be totally OP and dumb.
[7009.74 → 7011.82] I swear I will not play because yeah,
[7011.92 → 7012.16] the
[7013.54 → 7013.86] yeah.
[7013.96 → 7016.08] It's more fun to have no idea what we're doing.
[7016.28 → 7016.46] Yeah.
[7016.74 → 7017.06] I mean,
[7017.34 → 7019.06] everyone's struggling in the same way.
[7019.06 → 7020.42] It was a big part of the entertainment.
[7021.78 → 7022.40] There's a game.
[7022.50 → 7024.26] I'm really excited to play at LTX.
[7025.00 → 7029.96] It was actually indie dev'd be one of my old colleagues at NCI.
[7030.18 → 7030.76] Do you remember Tom?
[7031.10 → 7031.44] Yes.
[7031.68 → 7031.94] Yeah.
[7032.24 → 7032.56] Yeah.
[7032.92 → 7034.10] So it probably looks really cool.
[7034.16 → 7034.72] Tom made a game.
[7035.22 → 7036.94] Did he actually like dev it or did he do all the art?
[7037.00 → 7037.56] I think so.
[7037.74 → 7037.96] Whoa.
[7038.02 → 7038.20] I mean,
[7038.22 → 7038.62] I don't know.
[7038.70 → 7038.92] Cool.
[7039.10 → 7039.36] I mean,
[7039.40 → 7039.50] he,
[7039.74 → 7040.90] I think he said he did.
[7041.06 → 7041.24] Sweet.
[7041.74 → 7042.22] Maybe he lied.
[7042.32 → 7042.80] Maybe it's AI,
[7043.10 → 7045.38] but I'm not going to ask him to show me what kind of hammer he used.
[7046.92 → 7047.72] Good referential.
[7047.94 → 7048.70] Let's do the next one.
[7048.76 → 7048.92] Anyway,
[7048.92 → 7054.26] I played it for about two minutes just to kind of make sure that it functioned enough to,
[7054.78 → 7055.12] um,
[7055.24 → 7055.36] to,
[7055.50 → 7055.62] but,
[7055.74 → 7056.02] and I'm,
[7056.02 → 7058.62] I'm not going to touch it again, and then we'll,
[7058.68 → 7058.82] uh,
[7058.82 → 7059.66] we'll have some fun with it.
[7059.84 → 7060.06] Nice.
[7060.56 → 7060.74] Yeah.
[7060.76 → 7061.18] I'm excited.
[7061.18 → 7063.96] What's your best tech related dad joke?
[7064.84 → 7066.72] I can never do this on the spot.
[7066.84 → 7067.00] Yeah.
[7067.00 → 7068.84] You can't do a dad joke on the spot.
[7068.98 → 7069.92] That is not a dad joke.
[7070.00 → 7070.14] Yeah.
[7070.22 → 7070.50] They just,
[7070.68 → 7071.36] question denied.
[7071.62 → 7071.86] Lol.
[7073.16 → 7073.80] Moving on.
[7073.80 → 7074.48] Hey Linus,
[7074.56 → 7078.54] have you ever considered making a slim version of the LTT backpack for someone that typically
[7078.54 → 7083.92] carries a lighter load of accessories and likes a backpack instead of a laptop bag?
[7084.38 → 7084.54] Uh,
[7084.56 → 7084.82] yes.
[7085.00 → 7089.92] Yvonne's been daily driving our current prototype and I think we're really close to getting
[7089.92 → 7093.56] the comfort nailed down after which we're going to have to get another prototype that
[7093.56 → 7097.24] actually has all the pockets and zippers and everything on it because hers is really
[7097.24 → 7097.58] bad.
[7097.86 → 7098.10] Uh,
[7098.10 → 7098.36] it just,
[7098.36 → 7098.94] it's just blank.
[7099.38 → 7101.66] It's just the shell because we're trying to nail down the
[7101.66 → 7102.72] the strap positioning.
[7103.10 → 7103.46] Uh,
[7103.48 → 7105.16] so it doesn't have a handle on the top.
[7105.16 → 7110.06] And the number of times I've interacted with it personally or watched someone else interact
[7110.06 → 7112.50] with it and go for the handle, and it's just not there.
[7112.64 → 7114.08] It's been hilarious.
[7114.68 → 7115.02] Um,
[7115.08 → 7116.26] but we're getting close.
[7116.58 → 7117.28] It's going to,
[7117.48 → 7121.66] it's going to actually be not that different in terms of total capacity.
[7121.66 → 7123.90] If you load it up compared to the existing one,
[7123.92 → 7124.52] it'll be less,
[7124.52 → 7129.38] but it's not as much less as it looks because we moved the water bottle holder to the outside.
[7130.66 → 7131.10] Um,
[7131.62 → 7131.94] yeah,
[7131.94 → 7132.30] but it's,
[7132.30 → 7132.80] it's more,
[7132.92 → 7134.38] we're trying to make it fit on the
[7134.38 → 7136.80] the Maria's and the Yvonne's of the world.
[7137.16 → 7137.60] Um,
[7137.66 → 7138.42] Maria is one of our,
[7138.54 → 7139.56] one of our other staffers here.
[7140.22 → 7143.86] I'm currently pursuing a major in electrical engineering,
[7144.02 → 7146.30] microelectronics and graduate in three to four years.
[7146.40 → 7148.58] Do you think Intel would hire someone like me?
[7149.26 → 7149.80] I don't know.
[7149.96 → 7150.42] I should,
[7150.52 → 7153.80] I should hope you've looked into that before entering that program.
[7153.80 → 7157.76] I think the best way to do that would Google would be Googling Intel jobs.
[7158.24 → 7158.26] Uh,
[7158.26 → 7158.34] yeah.
[7158.40 → 7160.22] And Intel hires all kinds of people.
[7160.46 → 7160.62] Yes.
[7160.66 → 7161.22] Like you could,
[7161.32 → 7162.64] you could have a marketing,
[7162.98 → 7163.30] you know,
[7163.30 → 7163.64] whatever,
[7163.64 → 7164.92] and they would probably hire,
[7164.98 → 7166.42] I'm sure there's a position there somewhere.
[7167.30 → 7167.70] Um,
[7168.20 → 7168.68] I mean,
[7168.80 → 7171.90] you could be the world's most overqualified janitor at Intel.
[7172.02 → 7172.26] And I'm,
[7172.66 → 7172.94] you know,
[7172.98 → 7173.46] there you go.
[7174.64 → 7174.80] Hi,
[7174.82 → 7175.58] Uncle Linus.
[7175.86 → 7181.58] If you could have any games remastered with the kind of graphics shown in the first clip you did at the start of the show,
[7181.76 → 7183.04] what game would it be?
[7183.04 → 7184.70] Also 10 hour WAN show,
[7184.82 → 7185.10] please.
[7187.46 → 7187.90] Okay.
[7187.94 → 7188.38] First,
[7188.46 → 7188.78] no.
[7192.26 → 7193.20] We should do,
[7193.30 → 7194.10] uh,
[7194.16 → 7194.92] at LTX,
[7195.14 → 7198.48] we should just turn WAN show into like us gaming at whale land.
[7198.48 → 7202.26] I have some stuff that would allow that to happen.
[7203.46 → 7204.52] What about like,
[7204.64 → 7205.10] uh,
[7206.24 → 7206.54] man,
[7206.58 → 7206.96] I'm trying to,
[7207.00 → 7207.82] I'm trying to think,
[7207.90 → 7209.22] I'm trying to come up with a good answer,
[7209.32 → 7220.70] but the one that jumps into my head is I'd love to play like an Anna game where you can really zoom in to like a photo realistic world with AI generated people that are going around.
[7220.70 → 7229.70] Like for no reason other than just digital sightseeing almost like some kind of builder game with that level of photo realism would be kind of,
[7229.70 → 7230.82] would be kind of cool to me.
[7230.92 → 7232.78] I know that's probably not what you were asking.
[7233.18 → 7234.24] I like the answer though.
[7234.24 → 7234.80] It's interesting.
[7235.56 → 7236.00] I,
[7236.08 → 7237.20] I just immediately went to like.
[7237.20 → 7237.42] Borrowing.
[7238.44 → 7238.86] Yeah,
[7238.90 → 7239.22] he did.
[7242.12 → 7243.32] Because of course he did.
[7243.42 → 7243.62] All right.
[7243.62 → 7243.84] Yeah,
[7243.84 → 7244.68] we can carry on.
[7244.74 → 7245.52] We all know his answer.
[7245.74 → 7245.92] Well,
[7246.32 → 7248.24] uh,
[7248.24 → 7251.56] what are your thoughts on someone bringing their steam deck to whale land?
[7252.04 → 7253.16] I would expect them to.
[7253.26 → 7254.46] It happened to last whale land.
[7254.56 → 7261.68] And the steam deck ended up being an unnatural advantage in one of our competitions that they slayed.
[7261.68 → 7264.20] It turns out that 3d cadet table,
[7264.88 → 7265.08] the
[7265.08 → 7265.46] uh,
[7265.50 → 7265.68] the
[7265.68 → 7265.94] the
[7265.94 → 7275.06] the Windows XP pinball game has been ported to Linux and runs so much better on the steam deck than it does on Windows.
[7275.06 → 7281.30] Now at much higher frame rates and not to mention that this is much more natural than whatever it is that you're doing with a keyboard.
[7281.54 → 7284.86] So they absolutely slayed the next,
[7285.00 → 7287.58] the next runner-up by playing on their steam deck.
[7287.58 → 7288.04] And we were like,
[7288.08 → 7288.24] well,
[7288.32 → 7289.82] I guess I have to accept it.
[7289.90 → 7291.00] He got the score.
[7291.00 → 7292.16] Wasn't outside the rules.
[7292.28 → 7292.52] Nope.
[7293.86 → 7294.96] You're all workaholics,
[7295.12 → 7299.00] but what maker creative things do you enjoy doing when you have free time?
[7299.22 → 7300.46] Painting fibre arts,
[7300.96 → 7301.36] doodling.
[7303.42 → 7303.62] Hmm.
[7305.92 → 7306.20] Hmm.
[7307.48 → 7310.16] I think that for me,
[7311.06 → 7311.70] um,
[7312.14 → 7313.30] well,
[7313.38 → 7313.70] okay,
[7313.80 → 7314.12] fine.
[7314.20 → 7315.98] I was talking about my paint booth earlier.
[7315.98 → 7317.38] I am planning to paint my bike.
[7318.70 → 7321.58] So I haven't actually fired up the sprayer yet.
[7321.70 → 7323.42] Although I will this weekend.
[7323.60 → 7323.96] Um,
[7324.20 → 7325.68] I somehow got roped into,
[7325.88 → 7330.74] I volunteered to help James paint his walls because I have experience with that.
[7330.74 → 7336.10] And I knew that I would be able to help him do a much better job with even just a few hours of setting him up for it.
[7336.78 → 7342.02] And somehow I got roped into helping James paint his kitchen cabinets,
[7342.02 → 7347.38] which is not something that I am super experienced at,
[7347.38 → 7348.10] or in fact,
[7348.18 → 7350.10] even have ever done before.
[7350.10 → 7352.66] But I do have the equipment for it.
[7352.74 → 7354.84] So we're going to be muddling our way through it together,
[7354.84 → 7355.62] which will be fun.
[7355.70 → 7361.40] But the real reason that I have this spray equipment is so that I can do up my motorbike in this colour scheme.
[7361.54 → 7362.34] So that's not actually,
[7362.46 → 7363.34] that's like a mock-up.
[7363.44 → 7363.58] Yeah.
[7363.66 → 7365.00] Maria did this up for me and,
[7365.10 → 7365.32] um,
[7365.52 → 7371.46] I contracted her out of hours to just kind of mock this up for me because I'm lazy and don't feel like figuring out how to do it.
[7372.06 → 7372.42] Um,
[7373.06 → 7375.38] so that's something I'm planning to do.
[7375.46 → 7376.84] So I guess that's kind of what you're asking.
[7377.10 → 7378.30] I like fixing stuff.
[7378.30 → 7380.98] I don't know if that really counts.
[7381.24 → 7381.32] Yeah.
[7381.36 → 7384.38] I'm not like super knowledgeable or good at doing it,
[7384.38 → 7385.48] but I enjoy it.
[7385.56 → 7386.20] I don't know why,
[7387.02 → 7389.70] but over the years,
[7389.70 → 7394.88] I remember being colossally disappointed many times by how not handy you were.
[7396.16 → 7396.98] With what?
[7397.92 → 7398.12] Well,
[7398.24 → 7398.36] see,
[7398.42 → 7402.34] I grew up on a hobby farm and I know that your dad's like super handy.
[7403.26 → 7407.54] And so there would be just things that I would take for granted that you would just know how to do.
[7407.54 → 7409.02] Like paint a thing.
[7409.46 → 7409.56] Nope.
[7409.68 → 7412.76] And you'd just be like to,
[7412.76 → 7413.98] to quote Yankee,
[7414.04 → 7415.82] it'd be like watching a cat try to fly a kite.
[7415.92 → 7417.72] Like you just were incapable.
[7417.96 → 7419.52] And I didn't understand it.
[7419.98 → 7420.68] My dad.
[7420.78 → 7421.54] Because you weren't stupid.
[7421.68 → 7422.00] You just,
[7422.10 → 7422.34] you know,
[7422.40 → 7422.92] the story,
[7423.12 → 7423.90] my dad,
[7423.98 → 7424.20] like,
[7424.26 → 7425.96] so my dad was around a ton.
[7426.34 → 7426.64] Yeah.
[7426.64 → 7428.90] When I was like quite young,
[7428.90 → 7431.90] but when I was in like my teens,
[7431.90 → 7433.42] when you would do a lot of this type of stuff.
[7433.54 → 7433.82] Yeah.
[7434.02 → 7435.50] They're really long story,
[7435.58 → 7436.32] but he had to,
[7436.96 → 7437.70] he didn't have to,
[7437.78 → 7441.18] but he stepped up and got a bunch of jobs and stuff and was like,
[7441.18 → 7445.56] it wasn't absent father because he was around.
[7445.82 → 7446.08] Yeah.
[7446.08 → 7448.32] But the time that he was around would be like,
[7448.86 → 7449.08] Oh,
[7449.10 → 7451.12] I have two hours between my jobs.
[7451.78 → 7453.60] Let's like hang out for a throw ball.
[7454.78 → 7455.10] Like,
[7455.24 → 7455.80] or like,
[7455.92 → 7456.08] well,
[7456.08 → 7457.18] he's probably like too tired.
[7457.32 → 7457.56] Right.
[7457.68 → 7457.94] Okay.
[7458.58 → 7459.10] But like,
[7459.16 → 7459.92] how about you throw the ball?
[7459.98 → 7460.38] I'll watch.
[7460.52 → 7462.26] And then a lot of times if something needed to be done,
[7462.30 → 7463.04] he wouldn't have that much time.
[7463.04 → 7464.84] So he would just like to do it so I could observe,
[7465.36 → 7466.88] but I often wasn't doing it myself.
[7467.08 → 7467.38] Yeah.
[7467.38 → 7468.02] Um,
[7468.76 → 7469.40] but I mean,
[7469.40 → 7470.26] since then he's like,
[7470.30 → 7471.40] show me more things and stuff.
[7471.48 → 7471.70] Right.
[7471.78 → 7472.30] But yeah.
[7472.60 → 7472.80] Yeah.
[7472.80 → 7472.96] See,
[7472.98 → 7473.36] I don't know.
[7473.36 → 7473.94] Like I just,
[7474.06 → 7474.48] I was,
[7474.54 → 7474.86] um,
[7475.04 → 7475.98] not by choice,
[7475.98 → 7479.66] but I was very often dragged into things.
[7479.66 → 7480.70] So I just,
[7480.76 → 7482.44] I just know all kinds of things.
[7482.44 → 7485.20] I've done a bunch of like distributed labour tasks,
[7485.20 → 7487.10] but not things like paint this thing.
[7487.10 → 7487.80] Like we,
[7487.90 → 7488.22] uh,
[7488.22 → 7490.08] we re-roofed my parents' house.
[7490.16 → 7490.38] Right.
[7490.54 → 7492.12] So like I've done roofing.
[7492.12 → 7492.38] Sure.
[7492.38 → 7493.46] I think I did a pretty good job of that.
[7493.58 → 7493.70] Yeah.
[7493.70 → 7495.60] That's like quite different, actually.
[7495.72 → 7496.58] I've done roofing,
[7496.58 → 7497.48] interior exterior,
[7497.56 → 7499.26] and I'm not talking like professionally.
[7499.50 → 7500.58] So like some roofing,
[7500.68 → 7501.10] interior,
[7501.36 → 7502.54] exterior painting.
[7502.80 → 7503.32] Um,
[7503.42 → 7503.78] I've,
[7503.86 → 7504.34] you know,
[7504.38 → 7506.46] treated infections on horses feet,
[7506.64 → 7507.54] cared for livestock,
[7508.08 → 7508.32] you know,
[7508.54 → 7509.76] built out buildings,
[7509.76 → 7510.86] um,
[7510.98 → 7511.34] like,
[7511.40 → 7511.86] uh,
[7511.96 → 7512.60] uh,
[7512.64 → 7513.68] repaired gravel,
[7514.04 → 7514.24] you know,
[7514.30 → 7514.74] driveway,
[7515.44 → 7515.82] uh,
[7515.88 → 7516.16] you know,
[7516.30 → 7519.48] buried that fawn that the dog killed,
[7519.64 → 7520.78] operated an excavator.
[7520.78 → 7521.44] Like I just,
[7521.82 → 7522.88] like there's just so much,
[7523.00 → 7523.48] uh,
[7523.48 → 7524.48] uh,
[7524.92 → 7526.00] dug fence posts,
[7526.00 → 7526.82] both by,
[7526.88 → 7527.76] by digging them,
[7527.88 → 7529.28] pouring concrete and embedding them,
[7529.34 → 7530.32] also by post pounding.
[7530.64 → 7531.48] Like there's just,
[7532.20 → 7532.94] on a farm,
[7533.06 → 7534.78] even if it's not a for-profit farm,
[7535.00 → 7535.46] there's just,
[7535.58 → 7536.46] there's a lot of stuff to do.
[7536.56 → 7537.88] There's so much to do.
[7537.96 → 7539.16] It's utterly never ending.
[7539.32 → 7539.44] See,
[7539.46 → 7540.52] like I've gone to,
[7540.68 → 7541.02] because I,
[7541.10 → 7542.28] I grew up out there,
[7542.28 → 7543.58] but we didn't have one.
[7543.78 → 7546.50] So I've gone to like friends' houses and helped them with,
[7546.50 → 7546.96] yeah,
[7546.96 → 7548.14] stuff that they had to do.
[7548.26 → 7549.22] But there's a big difference.
[7549.54 → 7549.64] Yeah.
[7549.76 → 7551.32] Like my friends didn't,
[7551.70 → 7554.20] weren't really helpful when we were like,
[7554.72 → 7555.06] you know,
[7555.16 → 7556.46] loading the barn with hay.
[7556.98 → 7557.38] Right.
[7557.42 → 7557.98] Like they were,
[7558.16 → 7561.72] they'd kind of do a couple, and then they'd get bored, and they'd wander off, and I get it.
[7561.84 → 7562.58] I didn't get bored.
[7562.86 → 7565.44] You probably would believe that to be fair.
[7565.44 → 7565.68] Yeah.
[7565.78 → 7566.04] Yeah.
[7566.08 → 7568.72] You probably would have been a lot more helpful than my friends were.
[7570.02 → 7570.72] But like,
[7571.02 → 7571.58] I mean,
[7571.58 → 7572.68] I still didn't live there.
[7572.82 → 7573.90] So it wasn't a constant.
[7574.12 → 7575.78] People are asking repair a gravel driveway.
[7575.92 → 7576.04] What,
[7576.14 → 7576.68] what is that?
[7576.68 → 7577.48] So you,
[7577.54 → 7577.96] you don't,
[7578.12 → 7579.78] you don't just lay down gravel.
[7580.02 → 7581.28] So potholes develop.
[7581.62 → 7583.86] And then the way that you put it down,
[7583.94 → 7587.46] you just have to kind of get a feel for how much of it to,
[7587.46 → 7591.16] to shovel and wheelbarrow out and how much to fill it so that when it settles,
[7591.16 → 7592.64] it'll actually be smooth when you,
[7592.76 → 7593.88] when you drive up it,
[7593.88 → 7594.94] like just gravel,
[7595.04 → 7595.62] dry gravel.
[7595.90 → 7596.18] Oh man.
[7596.24 → 7597.70] Our driveway was so frigging long.
[7597.76 → 7598.80] It was over a hundred meters long.
[7598.80 → 7600.14] And the incline was like this.
[7601.00 → 7603.80] So like getting out of there and the snow and stuff was brutal.
[7603.94 → 7604.32] And I had to,
[7604.32 → 7604.66] I had to,
[7604.74 → 7606.58] I had to often run because I was usually,
[7606.58 → 7609.36] really late up to my bus stop uphill both ways.
[7609.36 → 7611.64] Of course I hated that driveway.
[7611.64 → 7612.16] Curse,
[7612.28 → 7613.46] curse that driveway.
[7614.36 → 7615.78] If you guys want to see it,
[7615.84 → 7617.28] it doesn't really matter.
[7618.28 → 7618.96] here,
[7619.22 → 7619.78] here's the
[7619.94 → 7621.22] here's the place where I grew up.
[7622.82 → 7623.30] Blah,
[7623.34 → 7623.48] blah,
[7623.56 → 7623.90] blah.
[7624.02 → 7624.26] Well,
[7624.34 → 7625.30] grew up after 11.
[7625.84 → 7627.80] So I lived in Ladder until,
[7628.06 → 7628.70] until then.
[7629.20 → 7629.40] Uh,
[7629.40 → 7629.86] here we go.
[7631.32 → 7631.64] There,
[7632.02 → 7633.68] this is my parents' hobby farm,
[7633.72 → 7634.20] or at least,
[7635.02 → 7635.24] uh,
[7635.24 → 7636.24] what it looks like now.
[7636.44 → 7638.72] So this used to be a riding ring for horses.
[7639.78 → 7640.14] Um,
[7640.50 → 7641.82] there are ponds here.
[7641.92 → 7642.88] It's kind of hard to make out.
[7642.96 → 7643.20] This is,
[7643.26 → 7644.12] this is all,
[7644.48 → 7645.48] uh,
[7645.48 → 7646.00] my parents,
[7646.44 → 7647.72] former property.
[7647.82 → 7648.06] They don't,
[7648.16 → 7648.84] they don't have it anymore.
[7649.06 → 7649.30] Not now.
[7649.40 → 7650.28] Don't like to show up.
[7650.62 → 7651.54] And we are not,
[7651.88 → 7652.24] like,
[7652.30 → 7653.62] we were not crazy wealthy.
[7653.72 → 7654.60] My parents were teachers.
[7654.60 → 7655.28] Uh,
[7655.28 → 7658.10] this land was empty when they got it.
[7658.54 → 7658.94] Um,
[7658.96 → 7660.92] it was a big stretch for them to get it.
[7661.04 → 7661.44] And,
[7661.66 → 7661.96] uh,
[7661.96 → 7664.52] it was basically like worthless compared to now.
[7664.56 → 7665.70] It's probably worth a fortune.
[7665.70 → 7668.30] Like estates out here are totally a thing.
[7668.30 → 7672.36] You can see like other people with their fancy paved driveways and whatnot.
[7672.68 → 7672.78] Yeah.
[7672.78 → 7674.04] We didn't have anything like that.
[7674.08 → 7674.66] In fact,
[7674.72 → 7674.82] Oh,
[7674.86 → 7675.38] is this paved now?
[7675.50 → 7676.12] I think so.
[7676.24 → 7676.88] It looks like it might be,
[7676.96 → 7678.24] it might be paved now.
[7678.82 → 7679.22] Um,
[7679.22 → 7680.34] also many,
[7680.52 → 7681.52] many of these buildings,
[7681.52 → 7682.26] whether it's the
[7682.26 → 7683.64] the pump house is hidden over here.
[7683.72 → 7686.22] We're actually built by my parents themselves.
[7686.58 → 7688.90] All of this was just like dirt and blackberries.
[7688.90 → 7691.76] It looks like a lot of landscaping has been done since we lived here.
[7691.82 → 7692.60] See my dad,
[7692.66 → 7693.54] like my dad,
[7693.62 → 7694.42] uh,
[7694.50 → 7695.14] built this,
[7695.24 → 7697.16] like that garage that's in our backyard.
[7697.16 → 7697.50] Yeah.
[7697.60 → 7698.44] Like he built that,
[7698.44 → 7702.72] but I was like too young at that point to be able to contribute much.
[7703.28 → 7703.72] Um,
[7703.72 → 7707.28] he also did this like custom solar panel array for our pool.
[7707.44 → 7708.12] Chicken coop's gone,
[7708.12 → 7710.12] but I was also not very useful at that time.
[7710.44 → 7710.96] Barn still there.
[7711.48 → 7715.14] A lot of stuff was either I was too young or I was already now out of the house.
[7715.80 → 7720.06] And like the gap where I would be useful at like contributing and also learning things was,
[7720.36 → 7721.02] he was very busy.
[7721.42 → 7722.24] It's just unfortunate timing,
[7722.50 → 7722.86] but he's,
[7722.86 → 7725.14] he's definitely gone out of his way to educate since then.
[7725.58 → 7726.12] Fun fact.
[7726.28 → 7726.68] Um,
[7726.72 → 7731.86] if that place is ever on the market, and you're into high quality drinking water,
[7731.86 → 7734.62] it has a drilled well that by luck,
[7734.62 → 7735.22] uh,
[7735.22 → 7737.90] we managed to hit some kind of underground spring or something.
[7737.90 → 7743.92] And it has the best drinking water I have ever encountered in my life and never runs dry.
[7743.92 → 7750.68] It's like the highlight of that property for me and probably something that wouldn't even show up on a real estate brochure.
[7751.08 → 7751.52] Nice.
[7751.52 → 7752.08] Like,
[7752.24 → 7752.68] honestly,
[7752.86 → 7753.00] I,
[7753.14 → 7759.34] I spent my childhood bathing in water that people would pay like $6 for a little bottle of,
[7759.36 → 7762.28] and it would still taste like crap because it's been in a plastic bottle.
[7762.58 → 7762.74] Yeah.
[7763.10 → 7763.32] Yeah.
[7764.08 → 7764.68] Obviously.
[7765.30 → 7765.78] Um,
[7765.90 → 7766.68] plastic bottles.
[7767.00 → 7767.20] Yay.
[7767.86 → 7768.24] Anywho.
[7768.24 → 7770.28] Oh,
[7770.48 → 7771.06] more topics.
[7771.28 → 7773.74] And I'm signed out of Google Docs because why wouldn't I be?
[7773.88 → 7774.38] Luke hit me.
[7774.38 → 7774.48] Uh,
[7775.52 → 7777.22] Reddit to charge for its API.
[7777.76 → 7779.00] This is actually very interesting.
[7779.12 → 7780.16] It's more companies than just Reddit.
[7780.52 → 7784.08] Reddit has announced it will be charging businesses to use its API.
[7784.56 → 7786.70] No direct motive was given for the changes.
[7786.88 → 7787.08] Cough,
[7787.16 → 7787.36] cough,
[7787.36 → 7793.50] but data scraped from Reddit is known to be a major component of several prominent AI training databases.
[7794.00 → 7794.34] Likewise,
[7794.82 → 7797.36] Reddit is planning to go public later this year and could use future,
[7798.24 → 7801.30] future income from AI development as a draw for investors.
[7801.78 → 7804.62] The announcement stated that the changes were directed at,
[7804.74 → 7805.22] in quotes,
[7805.34 → 7808.14] third parties who require additional capabilities,
[7808.52 → 7809.60] higher usage limits,
[7809.94 → 7811.22] and broader usage rights,
[7811.66 → 7812.14] end quote.
[7812.54 → 7812.84] And I,
[7812.96 → 7815.80] and will take effect following a 60-day notice period.
[7815.80 → 7821.26] While Reddit claims to want to keep its API accessible to developers that improve the Reddit experience,
[7821.66 → 7826.66] the vagueness of the announcement caused concern among developers of third party Reddit applications.
[7826.66 → 7833.62] CEO Steve Huffman described the company's authentic conversations as particularly valuable to LLMs,
[7833.98 → 7834.98] saying in quotes,
[7835.32 → 7839.00] there's a lot of stuff on the site that you'd only ever say in a valid,
[7839.12 → 7842.50] in therapy or AA or Alcoholics Anonymous.
[7842.68 → 7843.20] Or never at all.
[7843.20 → 7843.80] Or never at all.
[7843.92 → 7846.86] And that is a surprisingly transparent truth.
[7847.04 → 7847.56] Yeah.
[7847.78 → 7848.62] Discussion question.
[7848.62 → 7849.78] Kind of refreshing, actually.
[7850.00 → 7850.24] Yeah,
[7850.28 → 7850.76] to be honest.
[7850.76 → 7853.88] Reddit is full of incredibly intimate conversations.
[7854.26 → 7856.06] Is it right to use them for AI development?
[7856.26 → 7857.62] Is it right to sell them?
[7857.80 → 7857.98] Well,
[7858.02 → 7859.40] when you post it on the site,
[7859.58 → 7860.24] you kind of.
[7861.22 → 7863.26] I'm pretty sure that's even just in the terms of service.
[7863.32 → 7863.52] Yeah,
[7863.58 → 7864.70] you give it to the site.
[7864.78 → 7865.18] If it's,
[7865.18 → 7866.56] if it's posted publicly,
[7866.56 → 7867.08] that's,
[7867.16 → 7867.72] that's public.
[7867.84 → 7868.90] That's the thing that happened.
[7869.10 → 7869.62] You know,
[7869.62 → 7869.76] when,
[7869.94 → 7873.08] when I was all outraged about companies using private data,
[7873.08 → 7875.06] I was talking about private data earlier.
[7875.06 → 7876.84] I wasn't talking about public data.
[7877.02 → 7878.68] If they were doing this with like PMs on Reddit.
[7878.68 → 7879.12] Yeah,
[7879.16 → 7880.40] that's a whole other ball of wax,
[7880.54 → 7880.86] which I mean,
[7880.86 → 7882.42] wouldn't necessarily surprise me,
[7882.54 → 7883.58] but that,
[7883.66 → 7884.64] that would be different though.
[7885.32 → 7886.36] Stack overflow too.
[7888.16 → 7888.56] Um,
[7888.68 → 7888.98] that's,
[7889.04 → 7890.16] that's the really crazy one.
[7890.18 → 7890.62] In my opinion,
[7891.00 → 7892.52] stack overflow is talking about the same thing.
[7892.94 → 7893.66] Oh really?
[7893.80 → 7894.20] Yeah.
[7894.90 → 7895.36] I mean,
[7895.42 → 7896.78] there's this lockdown is,
[7896.86 → 7897.46] is happening.
[7897.72 → 7898.08] I mean,
[7898.08 → 7899.54] we've even been talking about it.
[7899.64 → 7899.80] You know,
[7899.80 → 7906.94] how are we going to publish information on LTT labs.com in a way that is not going to just train the machine learning,
[7906.94 → 7911.36] large language models that are going to replace any need to navigate to our site.
[7911.50 → 7916.38] We've been trying to figure out how to slow down AI and capitalism gave us the answer.
[7917.56 → 7919.68] I think this might literally be it.
[7919.68 → 7924.52] If these companies slap down expensive enough API agreements.
[7924.88 → 7925.16] Yeah.
[7925.16 → 7928.36] like Reddit and stack overflow,
[7928.36 → 7930.12] just those two things.
[7930.12 → 7931.62] It's such a huge,
[7931.62 → 7934.28] huge portion of these training models.
[7935.10 → 7936.26] Absolutely enormous.
[7936.62 → 7943.82] And what's fascinating is some companies are basing functions of their company around ChatGPT already.
[7944.22 → 7946.50] And the tools that came from ChatGPT.
[7946.94 → 7950.54] So if those suddenly get worse because of stuff like this,
[7950.54 → 7951.98] that'd be very interesting.
[7951.98 → 7954.16] Very interesting indeed.
[7954.50 → 7955.38] But yeah,
[7955.58 → 7957.96] I think that's really all there is to say on the topic.
[7957.96 → 7958.46] To be honest,
[7958.58 → 7960.34] there are other companies that are doing this.
[7960.74 → 7961.12] I know,
[7961.12 → 7961.56] uh,
[7961.62 → 7962.58] stack overflow and Reddit.
[7962.78 → 7964.06] There are other ones as well,
[7964.34 → 7964.98] but yeah.
[7966.96 → 7970.84] Someone asked if I would consider purchasing my childhood home to keep it in the family.
[7970.96 → 7971.16] No,
[7972.44 → 7972.84] it's fine.
[7972.88 → 7973.88] The house is a house to me.
[7973.92 → 7974.10] I mean,
[7974.10 → 7976.06] my family is my family and the house is just the house.
[7976.06 → 7976.50] Uh,
[7976.50 → 7978.02] but Arjun from the social team said,
[7978.10 → 7978.20] Hey,
[7978.24 → 7979.26] just heard you on the WAN show.
[7979.26 → 7982.24] There will be a short behind the scenes of the WEG hoodie photo shoot.
[7982.50 → 7982.70] Oh,
[7982.84 → 7983.14] sweet.
[7983.24 → 7984.06] Currently editing it.
[7984.16 → 7984.34] Cool.
[7984.46 → 7984.90] There you go.
[7985.38 → 7985.74] Nice work.
[7985.76 → 7986.42] Got the answer there.
[7986.52 → 7986.90] Good job.
[7987.00 → 7987.38] All right.
[7988.10 → 7989.98] Amazon offers louder dialogue.
[7990.12 → 7990.28] Okay.
[7990.34 → 7991.18] Dialogue boosting.
[7991.50 → 7991.66] Yeah.
[7991.66 → 7992.30] It's just like,
[7992.38 → 7993.40] so you don't have to buy a soundbar,
[7993.48 → 7993.74] I guess.
[7994.30 → 7994.54] Oh,
[7994.86 → 7995.98] it's an accessibility feature,
[7996.10 → 8001.30] but probably has a broader audience considering how many TV viewers report using subtitles most or all of the time.
[8001.30 → 8004.48] And this is probably more consequential for the industry.
[8004.66 → 8008.44] Samsung is considering switching to Bing.
[8008.64 → 8009.44] Oh yeah.
[8009.94 → 8010.16] Yeah.
[8010.26 → 8013.28] So this is why Google is actually so upset,
[8013.38 → 8013.52] man.
[8013.90 → 8018.00] I sent an email earlier today and I remember just being,
[8018.12 → 8019.02] it didn't matter,
[8019.46 → 8020.24] right?
[8020.28 → 8027.16] It didn't matter at all because it didn't change the meaning of what I was saying in any way,
[8027.16 → 8028.72] but it just,
[8028.84 → 8032.82] it just irritated me because it's so utterly unnecessary.
[8033.28 → 8033.72] Okay.
[8033.86 → 8035.70] Read this bottom email.
[8035.80 → 8037.18] I think everything's here.
[8037.34 → 8037.48] Yeah.
[8037.56 → 8037.74] Yeah.
[8037.74 → 8037.90] Yeah.
[8037.90 → 8038.12] Okay.
[8038.42 → 8038.60] Here.
[8038.72 → 8039.74] Read this bottom email.
[8040.24 → 8040.50] Just,
[8040.54 → 8041.24] just read it out.
[8042.00 → 8042.44] Oh,
[8042.48 → 8043.52] thanks for letting me know.
[8043.52 → 8046.72] Would love to get an update from them when that's resolved so I can use it.
[8046.84 → 8047.94] I found some alternatives,
[8048.22 → 8049.60] but none that I particularly trust.
[8050.24 → 8051.62] Why is trust capitalized?
[8051.92 → 8052.48] Why is trust capitalized?
[8054.34 → 8055.26] I don't know.
[8057.16 → 8058.42] Why?
[8059.18 → 8061.38] I find the way that I type on my phone.
[8061.48 → 8062.06] If I'm going really,
[8062.06 → 8062.72] I didn't type,
[8062.82 → 8063.62] I dictated it.
[8064.10 → 8064.56] Oh,
[8064.96 → 8067.90] ChatGPT wouldn't have made that mistake.
[8068.64 → 8069.08] Yeah.
[8069.36 → 8071.22] Why did it capitalize trust?
[8072.52 → 8073.24] I didn't,
[8073.24 → 8075.02] I didn't bother to correct it.
[8075.26 → 8076.00] It didn't matter.
[8076.20 → 8078.24] It didn't change the meaning of what I was saying,
[8078.38 → 8086.40] but it's just no wonder Google is in freak out mode right now because they've sat here.
[8086.40 → 8088.82] They've sat on their butt for a super long time.
[8088.84 → 8093.20] They've sat here complacently not making basic things like,
[8093.44 → 8098.94] like calling by voice or dictate proper capitalization and punctuation while dictating.
[8099.60 → 8103.96] And their competition has come up and created GPT-4.
[8104.18 → 8105.56] They found a way to,
[8105.80 → 8107.82] instead of try to keep biting,
[8107.94 → 8108.62] just leap ahead.
[8108.80 → 8112.26] One of the problems with this is the previous topic though.
[8112.26 → 8115.48] This is literally what I was saying as part of the previous topic.
[8115.60 → 8120.44] Certain companies are hitching up with ChatGPT and being like,
[8120.52 → 8120.68] okay,
[8120.68 → 8123.64] this is tons of efficiency, or it's better for whatever reason.
[8123.64 → 8127.98] We are going to move in this direction and that could bite them in the butt.
[8128.06 → 8128.86] If certain,
[8129.04 → 8129.90] you know,
[8130.10 → 8133.60] if certain things happen and maybe the data set can't be used anymore,
[8133.60 → 8139.90] or maybe an open AI needs to start paying way more money to be able to access these things.
[8139.98 → 8141.02] So they have to increase their fees,
[8141.12 → 8142.00] whatever else help Google.
[8142.48 → 8143.26] Oh no.
[8143.52 → 8144.34] So it's just,
[8144.40 → 8144.98] it's interesting.
[8145.36 → 8150.86] Samsung is in negotiations with Microsoft to switch the default search engine on its devices from Google to Bing.
[8150.86 → 8151.36] Samsung.
[8151.36 → 8153.12] Just for context,
[8153.18 → 8153.96] in case you didn't know,
[8154.32 → 8160.24] the default search for basically everything ever is Google and Samsung sells a heck of a lot of phones.
[8160.94 → 8163.26] When news on the potential deal became public,
[8163.40 → 8168.42] it led to a sharp fall in Google stock and reports of panic within Google search division.
[8168.92 → 8177.16] Google reportedly pays up to $3.5 billion every year for its position as default search on Samsung devices,
[8177.16 → 8181.66] as well as $20 billion for Apple devices.
[8182.20 → 8186.16] Samsung has switched to Bing before back in 2010 for some Galaxy models.
[8186.42 → 8186.66] However,
[8186.82 → 8190.38] this could also simply be a negotiation tactic on their part.
[8190.72 → 8191.00] I've,
[8191.04 → 8203.06] I've heard their scuttlebutt that Apple is also looking to either switch to Bing or at least leverage Bing's newfound relevance to renegotiate with Google.
[8203.20 → 8206.20] These are multi-billion dollars a year.
[8206.20 → 8206.52] Oh,
[8206.64 → 8206.72] you,
[8206.80 → 8207.64] I did mention the Apple one.
[8207.72 → 8207.82] Okay,
[8207.86 → 8208.02] cool.
[8208.50 → 8208.78] Uh,
[8208.78 → 8209.62] this is hilarious.
[8209.74 → 8210.02] Uh,
[8210.02 → 8211.88] on the subject of auto-completion,
[8211.88 → 8212.72] uh,
[8212.82 → 8215.50] second it guy in float plane chat says,
[8215.50 → 8218.82] I never mean to say the word duck.
[8219.26 → 8219.78] Yeah.
[8220.16 → 8221.66] Spoken like an iPhone user.
[8222.70 → 8223.22] Yeah.
[8224.52 → 8225.00] Um,
[8225.24 → 8225.64] all right.
[8225.70 → 8227.60] Netflix ends.
[8227.72 → 8229.18] I didn't even know they were still doing this.
[8229.46 → 8232.64] Netflix has ended their DVD mail service.
[8232.64 → 8234.08] This September,
[8234.54 → 8236.44] Netflix will be finally,
[8236.44 → 8237.48] uh,
[8237.56 → 8240.72] ending its 25-year-old DVD mail service,
[8240.72 → 8245.44] which brought in 145.7 million in revenue last year.
[8245.44 → 8248.54] That's a lot more than I thought.
[8248.84 → 8249.12] Yeah.
[8249.12 → 8254.64] The DVD division had a dedicated fan base among users without consistent internet access,
[8254.76 → 8258.62] as well as those who preferred its broader selection of more obscure titles,
[8258.76 → 8262.70] many of which are not widely available on most or any streaming service.
[8262.70 → 8266.04] But the DVD division has slowly shrunk over time.
[8266.56 → 8269.66] It once posted a selection of over 100,000 titles.
[8269.92 → 8274.58] While now it's unclear exactly how many titles the Netflix streaming service carries,
[8274.72 → 8277.14] but its U S library carries around 6,000 titles,
[8277.26 → 8280.58] similar to what was carried by a single blockbuster video location at the chain's peak.
[8280.82 → 8282.16] Our discussion question,
[8282.42 → 8284.38] what should happen to Netflix's DVD collection?
[8284.80 → 8290.00] And what alternatives are there for people looking for unusual titles or low cost physical media?
[8290.76 → 8291.08] Well,
[8291.08 → 8292.48] what should happen to their DVD collection?
[8292.76 → 8292.94] I,
[8292.98 → 8293.18] I,
[8293.30 → 8295.24] I really hope they don't just recycle them.
[8295.54 → 8296.26] That would suck.
[8296.34 → 8298.56] Maybe if they just left them with the last person who rented them.
[8298.64 → 8298.74] Like,
[8298.78 → 8299.16] I don't know.
[8299.58 → 8299.76] Like,
[8299.80 → 8300.30] honestly,
[8300.46 → 8300.96] like what I,
[8301.08 → 8303.28] I'd rather they not just end up in the garbage,
[8303.42 → 8304.56] keep the service going for a while,
[8304.62 → 8306.04] but you just don't have to return it anymore.
[8306.22 → 8306.44] Yeah.
[8306.50 → 8307.02] Like that,
[8307.10 → 8307.86] that'd be kind of chill.
[8308.14 → 8309.10] That'd be super cool.
[8309.18 → 8309.66] That'd be pretty sweet.
[8309.76 → 8310.12] Um,
[8310.16 → 8311.36] for people looking for,
[8311.42 → 8311.80] man,
[8311.84 → 8315.60] what alternatives do I say it?
[8317.92 → 8318.28] Like,
[8318.30 → 8318.58] what do you,
[8318.66 → 8319.48] what do you want from me?
[8319.48 → 8319.68] If,
[8319.74 → 8319.98] if,
[8319.98 → 8321.06] if rights holders,
[8321.08 → 8324.34] won't make their media available at that point,
[8324.34 → 8325.58] I mean,
[8325.58 → 8327.90] that's down to your own personal moral compass,
[8328.02 → 8328.22] right?
[8328.34 → 8328.60] Like,
[8330.36 → 8331.80] you know,
[8331.82 → 8332.72] if you want to watch it,
[8332.76 → 8332.92] like,
[8332.98 → 8334.38] why is someone standing in your way?
[8335.40 → 8336.08] Why do you,
[8336.16 → 8336.34] why,
[8336.40 → 8337.30] why tolerate that?
[8337.76 → 8338.12] Privateering.
[8338.12 → 8339.38] I didn't say it.
[8342.38 → 8343.30] It's being more popular.
[8343.50 → 8343.56] If it is,
[8343.56 → 8345.96] if it is available by legal means,
[8346.02 → 8346.52] of course,
[8346.62 → 8346.90] you know,
[8347.34 → 8347.58] you,
[8347.82 → 8348.34] it's,
[8348.58 → 8352.54] it's how creators are compensated,
[8352.54 → 8355.90] but if it is not available by legal means,
[8356.48 → 8359.02] it's not like you could compensate the creator by buying it.
[8359.02 → 8359.76] If you can't buy it.
[8359.80 → 8360.58] What do you want from me?
[8360.58 → 8360.78] Right?
[8361.46 → 8361.86] It's,
[8361.96 → 8362.20] uh,
[8362.28 → 8364.10] it's very interesting to me that like,
[8364.18 → 8364.58] honestly,
[8364.96 → 8366.24] three years ago,
[8366.80 → 8369.76] people didn't really talk about piracy that much.
[8369.98 → 8370.56] Oh yeah.
[8370.56 → 8371.30] It was kind of dead.
[8371.54 → 8371.76] Yeah.
[8371.88 → 8372.26] Spotify,
[8372.42 → 8372.70] Netflix.
[8372.98 → 8373.30] It's like,
[8373.30 → 8373.78] yeah.
[8374.20 → 8374.64] Steam.
[8374.84 → 8376.92] You had pretty good solutions for everything.
[8377.00 → 8379.40] It was the golden age of not having to pirate content.
[8379.58 → 8382.56] And now like Nintendo's doing the things that Nintendo does.
[8382.96 → 8383.26] Oh yeah.
[8383.36 → 8383.66] That's classic.
[8383.66 → 8388.60] Stuff like this keeps happening and people's cost of living is going up and their wages are not matching it.
[8388.66 → 8393.66] And also like this perfect storm is coming back for people to put the hats back on.
[8393.80 → 8394.38] It's really,
[8394.52 → 8394.86] it's,
[8394.94 → 8398.10] it's interesting to me that the industry is like allowing this to happen.
[8398.86 → 8400.72] And that they don't see what's happening.
[8400.84 → 8401.08] Yeah.
[8401.50 → 8401.90] Instead,
[8401.90 → 8402.48] it's like,
[8402.56 → 8402.68] oh,
[8402.74 → 8402.86] well,
[8402.88 → 8403.02] we'll,
[8403.02 → 8404.08] we'll just hike the rates.
[8404.28 → 8404.40] Yeah.
[8404.66 → 8404.80] Well,
[8404.84 → 8405.06] no,
[8405.12 → 8406.74] actually that's not a response.
[8407.10 → 8407.22] Yeah.
[8407.22 → 8407.70] I mean,
[8407.76 → 8409.78] Disney seems to be kind of waking up a little bit.
[8410.12 → 8421.52] Apparently they are going to be loosening the restrictions that they've put on licensing their own IP to third party services because they figured out what a gigantic hit to their bottom line.
[8421.62 → 8423.66] It was like Disney plus,
[8423.96 → 8431.26] while it has generated like a hundred and however many million subscribers is not a huge W for them compared to staying,
[8431.44 → 8432.02] too many services,
[8432.02 → 8433.02] staying focused on what they do best.
[8433.02 → 8434.14] Staying focused on what they do best,
[8434.24 → 8436.14] which is apparently run theme parks these days,
[8436.14 → 8443.30] and creating content and licensing it to a wide variety of providers all over the world.
[8443.30 → 8443.94] Like it just,
[8444.06 → 8445.02] it's like,
[8445.10 → 8445.30] yeah,
[8445.74 → 8446.40] duh,
[8446.60 → 8447.90] we had a good thing.
[8448.06 → 8449.06] Everything was working.
[8449.52 → 8449.94] And now,
[8450.14 → 8450.24] yeah,
[8450.28 → 8450.60] guys,
[8450.70 → 8450.92] you had,
[8451.06 → 8452.16] you had done goofed it up.
[8452.16 → 8459.06] I'm not going to subscribe to Disney plus and prime video and Netflix and whatever HBO's thing is called now.
[8459.14 → 8459.82] What's it called?
[8460.24 → 8461.12] Just max now.
[8461.20 → 8462.12] I can't even remember.
[8462.20 → 8462.92] I can't keep track.
[8463.12 → 8463.58] They keep changing.
[8463.70 → 8464.52] All the different services.
[8464.64 → 8465.78] I can't even keep track of them.
[8466.12 → 8468.68] There are certain things that do make sense to me on a separate service.
[8468.68 → 8470.42] I don't want to pay for sports ball.
[8470.56 → 8471.26] I don't need it.
[8471.36 → 8471.88] I don't care.
[8472.08 → 8473.14] I don't have time to follow it.
[8473.20 → 8474.04] I shouldn't say I don't care.
[8474.12 → 8478.28] I actually do sort of peripherally pay attention to what's going on.
[8478.34 → 8481.28] Like I kind of know whose favourites to win the
[8481.28 → 8481.72] you know,
[8481.80 → 8483.52] NBA Super Bowl or the
[8483.60 → 8484.68] I'm kidding,
[8484.68 → 8485.86] you know,
[8485.86 → 8486.42] or the
[8486.64 → 8486.98] you know,
[8487.70 → 8489.28] Stanley Bowl or whatever.
[8489.86 → 8490.42] Like I,
[8490.42 → 8491.46] I do that.
[8491.54 → 8492.52] I do it on purpose.
[8492.60 → 8492.78] I do,
[8492.82 → 8494.88] I do kind of know who the major players are.
[8495.26 → 8498.28] And most of that is just so that I can have conversations with people.
[8498.38 → 8498.70] It's like,
[8498.74 → 8498.90] oh,
[8498.98 → 8499.30] you know,
[8499.66 → 8501.44] LeBron's the all-time leading scorer.
[8501.56 → 8502.14] Now let's,
[8502.24 → 8505.02] we can talk about that a little bit and how that's super cool or whatever,
[8505.02 → 8507.54] but I don't have time to watch the game.
[8507.54 → 8514.42] So I don't want to pay for the broadcasting rights that whoever I'm giving money to has to pay in order to have cameras in the stadiums.
[8514.42 → 8514.60] Right.
[8515.10 → 8515.46] Um,
[8515.70 → 8517.92] but if it's TV shows,
[8518.96 → 8519.56] just,
[8520.28 → 8520.52] yeah,
[8520.60 → 8521.52] I can't.
[8522.00 → 8522.22] Yeah.
[8522.34 → 8523.28] I can't.
[8523.38 → 8523.56] Yep.
[8526.38 → 8527.28] People are upset.
[8527.96 → 8529.48] People are upset about my sports ball stuff.
[8529.58 → 8530.22] Formula football.
[8530.38 → 8530.48] Yeah.
[8530.50 → 8530.90] I like it.
[8531.08 → 8531.50] Oh no.
[8531.90 → 8532.34] Um,
[8532.74 → 8534.66] someone doesn't like the thing that I like.
[8534.96 → 8535.16] Yeah.
[8535.50 → 8536.44] This is hilarious.
[8536.44 → 8537.82] Sink plane on float plane.
[8538.38 → 8539.20] Great username.
[8539.42 → 8539.62] I think,
[8539.94 → 8540.42] um,
[8540.54 → 8544.44] didn't they change from HBO because it makes people think soft core porn when they hear it?
[8544.44 → 8545.08] When they hear it.
[8545.40 → 8545.68] What?
[8545.68 → 8547.56] Not necessarily that,
[8547.98 → 8549.54] but it apparently,
[8549.74 → 8549.90] yeah,
[8549.96 → 8554.04] they changed the branding because it makes people think of like very adult content.
[8554.54 → 8554.80] Oh.
[8554.80 → 8557.30] and they want to do more like it's,
[8557.30 → 8558.86] it's Warner media who owns them now.
[8558.86 → 8559.06] Right.
[8559.06 → 8561.30] So that's where you're going to get this new Harry Potter,
[8561.62 → 8562.60] um,
[8562.92 → 8567.32] television series that frankly feels very unnecessary.
[8567.82 → 8571.64] I'm not even going to wade into the controversy around the author.
[8572.24 → 8574.02] I want no part of that,
[8574.12 → 8574.92] but.
[8575.46 → 8579.52] Isn't that media's whole thing right now is like resurrecting dead series and just making it bad.
[8580.20 → 8580.62] I mean,
[8580.66 → 8581.24] I guess.
[8581.30 → 8581.54] Like that,
[8581.54 → 8581.94] that's a
[8582.00 → 8583.52] that's a pretty consistent trend.
[8583.84 → 8585.16] I'm not surprised it's happening.
[8585.16 → 8585.74] It's just,
[8585.80 → 8586.88] it's happening to everything.
[8587.30 → 8587.56] How do we,
[8587.56 → 8588.32] how do we ruin this?
[8588.38 → 8590.60] But there are talks about remaking princess bride.
[8590.72 → 8592.56] If you want it to be more on the nose.
[8593.66 → 8594.10] Okay.
[8594.22 → 8595.16] Hold on a second though.
[8595.26 → 8597.40] Princess bride came out in like 1984,
[8598.02 → 8598.96] 88,
[8599.22 → 8599.48] whatever.
[8599.60 → 8599.98] It can't,
[8600.04 → 8600.38] it's old.
[8600.50 → 8600.72] Yeah.
[8600.80 → 8601.42] It's old.
[8601.46 → 8602.68] It's at least old.
[8603.10 → 8605.30] Harry Potter's body isn't even cold yet.
[8606.64 → 8607.08] Literally.
[8607.70 → 8608.62] For real though.
[8608.62 → 8609.98] The actor is like still.
[8610.40 → 8611.28] Like young.
[8611.56 → 8611.80] Yeah.
[8612.08 → 8612.36] You know,
[8612.54 → 8614.54] I just,
[8614.54 → 8614.86] I,
[8615.06 → 8615.52] man,
[8615.60 → 8615.96] I just,
[8616.08 → 8616.74] I can't.
[8616.94 → 8617.08] Yeah.
[8617.18 → 8617.40] Oh,
[8617.50 → 8617.80] oh yeah.
[8617.90 → 8620.14] Twilight is apparently also getting a TV series.
[8620.66 → 8621.04] Yeah.
[8621.08 → 8622.70] You don't want to talk things that are unnecessary,
[8622.70 → 8623.30] but no,
[8623.36 → 8627.82] the thing about the Harry Potter one that feels particularly unnecessary is that they were good.
[8629.00 → 8630.30] They were already good.
[8631.08 → 8631.42] Twilight.
[8631.68 → 8631.88] I mean,
[8631.90 → 8636.18] at least you could make the argument that maybe they could make it better this time.
[8638.98 → 8640.10] Probably not though.
[8640.56 → 8640.96] Rough.
[8641.40 → 8641.70] Yeah.
[8641.70 → 8644.70] Um,
[8645.58 → 8648.42] another topic.
[8649.44 → 8649.92] Sure.
[8651.02 → 8653.08] NYPD adds semi-autonomous robots.
[8653.28 → 8653.52] I mean,
[8653.60 → 8656.54] do we really have to say much other than that?
[8656.64 → 8656.78] Oh,
[8656.80 → 8656.98] good.
[8657.06 → 8658.14] They have thermal cameras,
[8658.38 → 8659.28] two-way audio,
[8659.86 → 8661.88] can patrol a pre-programmed path,
[8661.98 → 8662.78] follow a person.
[8663.58 → 8663.68] Yeah,
[8663.70 → 8664.12] not yet.
[8664.20 → 8664.54] Apparently.
[8664.76 → 8665.48] That's probably good.
[8665.66 → 8665.88] Yeah.
[8665.88 → 8666.68] it's a matter of time.
[8668.30 → 8672.72] And the Red Cross wants gamers to stop committing war crimes,
[8672.72 → 8676.68] which sounds kind of stupid on the surface,
[8676.68 → 8680.76] but actually kind of makes sense to me.
[8680.88 → 8681.56] I know this is,
[8681.64 → 8683.08] this is probably me with a
[8683.08 → 8684.12] with a hot take here,
[8684.20 → 8685.58] but yeah,
[8685.62 → 8686.20] for real.
[8686.20 → 8686.56] I mean,
[8686.62 → 8688.36] we don't accept,
[8688.82 → 8689.90] say for example,
[8690.28 → 8690.70] um,
[8691.08 → 8692.90] video game depictions of,
[8692.90 → 8693.70] uh,
[8693.70 → 8695.08] extreme sexual violence.
[8695.08 → 8698.68] So why is it that we have this tolerance for,
[8698.78 → 8700.84] here are some of the things that the Red Cross outlined,
[8700.84 → 8701.68] um,
[8701.72 → 8706.36] as in violation of the rules of war and that are classified as war crimes,
[8706.36 → 8706.90] uh,
[8706.90 → 8707.50] thirsting.
[8707.64 → 8711.12] So that is shooting combatants while they are downed and cannot respond,
[8711.34 → 8711.96] uh,
[8712.04 → 8713.54] targeting non-combatants.
[8713.54 → 8715.32] So non-hostile NPCs,
[8715.32 → 8715.78] uh,
[8715.78 → 8717.22] targeting civilian buildings.
[8717.76 → 8718.28] Um,
[8719.14 → 8724.02] the Red Cross apparently even partnered with Lets Players to stream via its Twitch channel.
[8724.10 → 8724.56] Very cool.
[8724.56 → 8726.84] With the purpose of the campaign seeing,
[8727.20 → 8731.04] seeming to be to raise awareness of the rules of war.
[8731.08 → 8731.38] And it's,
[8731.74 → 8735.60] it's a pretty great message because I didn't watch any of it because I don't really watch streams,
[8735.88 → 8738.46] but I saw some of the titles and I thought it was really smart.
[8739.10 → 8739.58] Fun,
[8739.66 → 8740.70] fun little challenge to do.
[8741.14 → 8741.50] Uh,
[8741.56 → 8741.70] I,
[8741.76 → 8748.76] I think gamers are never going to care about these rules as long as they are detrimental to gameplay.
[8749.30 → 8751.78] And right now they would be detrimental to gameplay.
[8752.10 → 8753.36] But here's a question for you.
[8753.36 → 8757.52] Is a genuine mechanic in a lot of battle Royal games right now?
[8757.88 → 8758.12] Sure.
[8758.36 → 8765.52] But then is there not an argument to be made that you should be considered to be out of the round if you are incapacitated?
[8766.52 → 8766.64] No,
[8766.76 → 8767.04] that's,
[8767.04 → 8767.80] so that's like,
[8767.80 → 8770.68] it would take game developers to make this a thing.
[8770.68 → 8774.40] I even really like the give medical aid to anyone in need, friend or foe.
[8774.66 → 8775.72] Very interesting.
[8776.50 → 8785.14] Making a mechanic where you or your team receive some form of benefit for administering medical aid to a
[8785.14 → 8786.76] a downed foe.
[8786.76 → 8787.66] And it is like,
[8787.74 → 8790.14] then like makes them respawn or something.
[8790.44 → 8790.72] Yeah.
[8790.88 → 8791.58] As the mechanic.
[8791.58 → 8793.54] But then you gain like extra points.
[8793.66 → 8794.10] Or something.
[8794.20 → 8796.56] Is fascinating because you would have to be administering it.
[8796.56 → 8798.48] So it takes you out of the game for a second as well.
[8798.96 → 8799.52] But like,
[8799.56 → 8804.52] like you could make it fun and make it so that it's not a war crime anymore.
[8804.52 → 8804.92] Um,
[8805.60 → 8806.30] but it's,
[8806.30 → 8807.54] it's possible in my opinion.
[8807.96 → 8808.20] Yeah.
[8808.24 → 8808.54] I think,
[8808.58 → 8809.72] I think it's totally possible.
[8810.46 → 8810.86] Um,
[8812.60 → 8812.84] yeah,
[8813.42 → 8815.12] I think watching some of the streams,
[8815.12 → 8817.58] like if you're into watching streams could be fun though.
[8817.70 → 8818.04] I,
[8818.10 → 8819.42] I personally enjoy,
[8819.42 → 8820.20] uh,
[8820.30 → 8821.02] the challenges.
[8821.02 → 8821.34] Yeah.
[8821.64 → 8824.50] Inflicting like custom rules in games because it makes it very fun.
[8824.60 → 8826.20] It's fun to watch other people do that as well.
[8826.24 → 8827.20] So maybe check some of it out.
[8827.82 → 8828.18] Yeah.
[8828.34 → 8831.64] And now it's time to check out when show after dark,
[8831.72 → 8834.50] are you guys enjoying the more structured sort of show?
[8834.52 → 8835.80] format that we have now,
[8835.92 → 8836.64] let us,
[8836.74 → 8837.24] let us know,
[8837.30 → 8838.22] let us know in the comments.
[8838.68 → 8838.70] Um,
[8839.28 → 8839.40] yeah.
[8839.46 → 8841.14] Can you even tell that we changed anything?
[8841.24 → 8846.50] So Dan's got kind of guidelines for how long we should do some topics.
[8846.50 → 8848.94] And then when we should explain merge messages,
[8848.94 → 8850.32] when we should talk about,
[8850.44 → 8850.56] you know,
[8850.60 → 8852.26] what's new on LTT store this week.
[8852.34 → 8858.88] And then the idea is to have the main sort of tech discussion be a little bit
[8858.88 → 8864.06] less encumbered by talking about LTT store or merge messages or whatever else.
[8864.52 → 8864.96] Um,
[8864.96 → 8867.34] so that we kind of get through it in the early part of the show.
[8867.44 → 8870.14] So people who only care about that only have to watch,
[8870.18 → 8871.48] I think we've been live for about two hours,
[8872.06 → 8872.66] something like that.
[8873.24 → 8877.80] And then while still allowing us to address the vast majority of the merch messages
[8877.80 → 8878.30] that come in,
[8878.32 → 8878.74] or at least,
[8878.80 → 8880.94] at least a good number of them.
[8880.94 → 8882.44] I don't know if we're going to get to all of them this week.
[8882.50 → 8888.64] You guys went absolutely wag Nana for the wag hoodie.
[8889.02 → 8889.18] Um,
[8889.34 → 8889.56] I,
[8889.98 → 8890.20] yeah,
[8890.24 → 8893.58] couldn't have estimated that we were going to move this many of a dog sweater,
[8893.58 → 8895.16] but Hey,
[8895.56 → 8895.94] you know,
[8895.94 → 8896.80] I'm here for it.
[8897.06 → 8897.40] Um,
[8898.42 → 8899.00] it was,
[8899.06 → 8899.88] it was a passion.
[8900.06 → 8901.42] It was a passion project,
[8901.56 → 8903.08] a labour of love for,
[8903.26 → 8903.68] from the
[8903.80 → 8904.50] from the merge team,
[8904.50 → 8905.26] uh,
[8905.26 → 8908.58] was not something we expected to be a big profit centre, and it still won't be at
[8908.58 → 8909.08] that price,
[8909.08 → 8909.58] but like,
[8909.58 → 8909.90] whatever.
[8910.66 → 8910.94] Um,
[8910.94 → 8911.36] it's fun.
[8911.46 → 8912.12] You have to have fun.
[8912.90 → 8913.48] All right,
[8913.56 → 8913.88] Dan.
[8914.32 → 8914.66] Okay.
[8914.66 → 8915.82] We're going to go right into curated.
[8915.94 → 8919.48] You guys can go through some of the potentials and respond by a text if you want,
[8919.52 → 8920.30] or curate them.
[8920.40 → 8921.08] If you see something good,
[8921.08 → 8923.20] are you going top to bottom or bottom to top?
[8923.68 → 8923.96] Uh,
[8923.96 → 8924.44] I'm currently,
[8924.44 → 8926.04] are you on top or a bottom?
[8926.32 → 8928.86] I'm currently on top and your power regardless,
[8929.00 → 8929.20] right?
[8930.36 → 8932.26] He has strong typing power.
[8933.44 → 8934.24] Oh my.
[8935.92 → 8937.04] First curated.
[8937.34 → 8937.52] Oh,
[8937.60 → 8938.66] it's your curated message.
[8939.14 → 8939.48] Uh,
[8939.48 → 8940.96] Kyle asks,
[8941.26 → 8941.64] uh,
[8941.84 → 8942.96] hi,
[8943.04 → 8943.24] Luke.
[8943.30 → 8945.68] I'm currently in a networking class and I know that you guys,
[8945.68 → 8946.36] we already did this one.
[8946.36 → 8946.58] This one.
[8946.84 → 8947.00] Well,
[8947.08 → 8948.32] why is it still there then?
[8948.42 → 8948.78] Get rest.
[8948.92 → 8949.62] That's my fault.
[8949.98 → 8950.28] Uh,
[8950.28 → 8951.02] this is from Christopher.
[8951.94 → 8956.56] You talk about wanting to expand LTT store into becoming a more mainstream product producer
[8956.56 → 8958.30] or whatever the terminology is.
[8958.30 → 8959.42] My question is,
[8959.52 → 8962.18] would you consider sponsoring professional athletes?
[8964.50 → 8964.98] Yes.
[8966.16 → 8966.68] Um,
[8967.42 → 8969.36] but not in the ways that you,
[8969.36 → 8971.28] probably think,
[8971.28 → 8973.06] um,
[8974.06 → 8974.30] sorry,
[8974.36 → 8975.46] I'm just finishing.
[8975.84 → 8976.32] Okay.
[8976.32 → 8977.66] It's really hard to multitask.
[8977.80 → 8978.24] Typing a thing.
[8978.68 → 8979.08] Um,
[8979.08 → 8983.06] Oh,
[8983.14 → 8983.48] did you,
[8983.56 → 8984.40] did you archive it already?
[8984.94 → 8985.16] Yeah.
[8985.26 → 8985.50] Oh,
[8985.60 → 8985.76] okay.
[8985.78 → 8986.76] Do you want to sponsor athletes?
[8986.96 → 8987.24] Uh,
[8987.26 → 8987.46] okay.
[8987.56 → 8987.68] I,
[8987.76 → 8988.06] that's okay.
[8988.06 → 8988.70] I can read it there.
[8990.02 → 8990.42] Yeah,
[8990.42 → 8990.88] I would,
[8991.00 → 8996.58] but the reason that we would sponsor an athlete would be to account,
[8996.82 → 8997.96] like to overcome,
[8997.96 → 8998.56] uh,
[8998.56 → 9003.16] a perceived deficiency in funding for a sport that I'm particularly passionate about.
[9003.16 → 9003.46] So,
[9003.46 → 9004.16] uh,
[9004.16 → 9004.60] for example,
[9004.60 → 9010.22] we actually did do a sponsorship deal for this year with a local badminton club.
[9010.22 → 9010.54] Uh,
[9010.54 → 9014.20] they're called clear one, and we sponsored their team.
[9014.58 → 9021.62] But what I made really clear to the club owner was that I don't actually really care about my brand on the Jersey.
[9021.62 → 9022.34] Quite frankly,
[9022.60 → 9023.38] uh,
[9023.38 → 9024.52] from a marketing perspective,
[9024.66 → 9026.18] my reach is a lot greater than theirs.
[9026.18 → 9026.96] Like I don't,
[9027.00 → 9029.00] I don't need the logo on the Jersey.
[9029.12 → 9029.64] It doesn't matter.
[9029.74 → 9030.92] He wanted to do it.
[9030.92 → 9035.22] I think because sometimes it can look good to have,
[9035.30 → 9035.48] you know,
[9035.50 → 9036.56] good partners.
[9036.56 → 9038.94] And so he really wanted our logo on the Jersey.
[9039.22 → 9039.62] Uh,
[9039.62 → 9040.30] but I kind of went,
[9040.36 → 9040.48] yeah,
[9040.52 → 9042.20] that doesn't matter to me at all.
[9042.20 → 9042.68] Uh,
[9042.68 → 9051.60] what mattered to me was that his plan for the funding was to use it for after-school programs to kind of jumpstart after-school programs.
[9051.62 → 9056.26] programs outside of Richmond where badminton is really popular,
[9056.26 → 9056.98] um,
[9056.98 → 9058.64] and into other parts of the lower mainland,
[9058.64 → 9059.38] uh,
[9059.38 → 9063.58] so that they could provide coaching time to kids that otherwise would never pick up a racket.
[9063.82 → 9066.06] So that I was really interested in,
[9066.06 → 9069.78] but just sponsoring an athlete,
[9069.78 → 9070.84] um,
[9071.40 → 9071.62] you know,
[9071.62 → 9076.60] other than as a vanity project doesn't really have a ton of value to our brand from a business standpoint.
[9076.60 → 9078.62] That doesn't mean that I never make an emotional decision.
[9078.62 → 9081.34] I just mean that I have to look at it objectively first.
[9081.62 → 9083.36] Before succumbing to my emotions.
[9083.86 → 9084.18] Um,
[9084.18 → 9085.10] so with that in mind,
[9085.10 → 9086.44] like as a vanity project,
[9086.44 → 9088.70] would we ever consider sponsoring an athlete?
[9088.84 → 9088.98] Yeah,
[9088.98 → 9089.28] sure.
[9089.76 → 9090.10] Um,
[9090.64 → 9090.88] the
[9090.94 → 9093.82] the sport that I happen to be passionate about is badminton and,
[9093.82 → 9094.58] uh,
[9094.58 → 9097.34] it is woefully underfunded in Canada.
[9097.34 → 9098.96] I think for the 20,
[9099.66 → 9100.72] I want to say 2016,
[9100.72 → 9102.04] was that a Summer Olympics?
[9102.28 → 9104.44] I think it was the 2016 Summer Olympics.
[9104.44 → 9107.60] It had literally $0 of funding.
[9108.00 → 9108.40] Um,
[9108.46 → 9112.86] so the athletes that managed to get there had to do it all by the
[9112.86 → 9114.24] the straps of their own boots.
[9114.24 → 9115.62] And that's absolutely ridiculous.
[9116.52 → 9116.92] So,
[9116.92 → 9118.50] uh,
[9118.50 → 9120.06] that's the kind of thing that I could get behind.
[9120.06 → 9122.28] Like we wouldn't go after like the biggest in the space,
[9122.28 → 9124.80] but if it was someone who otherwise just wouldn't get a chance to compete,
[9124.80 → 9125.76] that's something that we'd consider.
[9127.30 → 9127.66] Okay.
[9127.72 → 9128.22] Next up.
[9128.22 → 9130.04] I prepared for a lot of applications.
[9131.22 → 9131.86] That sounds from.
[9131.94 → 9133.22] That's not something we're doing right now.
[9134.00 → 9136.42] Badminton funding is all tied up in opening our own centre,
[9136.52 → 9138.34] which is hopefully coming late this year.
[9138.42 → 9140.46] Everything funding is sort of currently tied up.
[9140.54 → 9140.96] It's just,
[9141.08 → 9142.90] he's saying it's maybe something,
[9143.22 → 9145.08] maybe one day we could consider.
[9145.26 → 9146.74] We've already had a bunch of people ask,
[9147.06 → 9147.44] by the way.
[9147.50 → 9147.72] really?
[9147.92 → 9148.12] Not,
[9148.12 → 9148.98] not right now.
[9149.04 → 9149.32] I mean,
[9149.38 → 9149.98] historically.
[9150.20 → 9150.42] Oh,
[9150.52 → 9150.78] okay.
[9150.98 → 9151.82] I didn't even know about that.
[9151.94 → 9152.08] Yeah.
[9152.12 → 9152.62] It's like a thing.
[9152.78 → 9152.90] Hey,
[9152.94 → 9155.68] Dan hit me with the rise of direct storage and games,
[9155.74 → 9158.00] needing SSDs would use Primo,
[9158.00 → 9163.34] cache to cache the most used data on a hard drive or slower SSD be a good alternative,
[9163.54 → 9166.92], or could it interfere with DS making it skip cache?
[9167.06 → 9168.94] That's actually a perfect question.
[9169.14 → 9174.92] And I think that it is possible that a solution like Primo cache could interfere with the proper
[9174.92 → 9176.12] functioning of direct storage.
[9176.40 → 9176.90] Obviously,
[9176.90 → 9181.02] I haven't tested it yet because I'm being asked this question for the first time right now.
[9182.42 → 9187.70] But if direct storage thinks it's operating off solid state media,
[9187.70 → 9189.60] which it doesn't necessarily have to.
[9190.10 → 9197.42] So the latest direct storage update actually has a provision for directly streaming assets off of a hard drive.
[9197.88 → 9200.28] It's up to the developer whether to use that or not.
[9200.34 → 9207.98] And I would hope that most developers would try to use direct storage properly, and we can just all move into the solid state era together.
[9207.98 → 9208.70] But,
[9208.70 → 9209.56] you know,
[9209.64 → 9209.80] hey,
[9209.88 → 9211.28] if you have it as a fallback,
[9211.32 → 9216.24] I could see that being really valuable for people who aren't ready or able to move to solid state yet.
[9217.30 → 9219.72] But I would think that regardless of that,
[9220.44 → 9228.16] confusing direct storage and making it think it's pulling off solid state when actually it's a solid state cached hard drive could be a problem.
[9228.16 → 9240.08] And I wouldn't want to do that because the whole point of direct storage is that we are eliminating extra hops in communication and pulling data directly off of devices,
[9240.20 → 9241.58] expecting it at a certain speed.
[9241.70 → 9242.88] If it's coming in slower,
[9242.96 → 9245.18] I think it would probably result in gameplay anomalies.
[9245.18 → 9250.56] Hi,
[9250.62 → 9250.82] Luke,
[9251.20 → 9253.98] how does float plane handle technical debt?
[9254.22 → 9258.26] And is there anything you've learned from these challenges that you can apply at LMG?
[9260.30 → 9261.56] Apply at LMG?
[9265.74 → 9267.30] Not really.
[9268.34 → 9271.06] Because it depends on how you define float plane,
[9271.16 → 9271.38] I guess,
[9271.38 → 9272.28] because float plane,
[9272.40 → 9275.08] the company does a lot more stuff than float plane,
[9275.18 → 9275.64] the website.
[9276.56 → 9278.48] Technical debt in regard to float plane,
[9278.54 → 9282.84] the website is a problem we've had for sure.
[9283.32 → 9287.62] There was a long time there where for various reasons that I'm not going to go into,
[9287.70 → 9289.88] because it would take an extremely long time to talk about all of it.
[9290.58 → 9294.24] We were chasing features a little bit harder than we probably should have been.
[9295.26 → 9299.14] And that resulted in quite a considerable amount of tech debt that we're,
[9299.62 → 9300.48] we currently over,
[9300.48 → 9304.60] we overcame a fair amount of it recently in order to release this beta site,
[9304.68 → 9309.38] which hopefully very soon will be just actually be the main site.
[9309.60 → 9311.22] But there's more work to be done.
[9311.40 → 9315.42] And we're going to be doing that for a pretty considerable amount of the rest of the year,
[9315.72 → 9317.52] solving a lot of those problems.
[9317.82 → 9318.94] But ideally,
[9318.94 → 9320.08] I try to do,
[9320.14 → 9320.82] you know,
[9320.90 → 9323.12] 10% time on maintenance to avoid it.
[9323.52 → 9325.04] We couldn't do that for a long time,
[9325.08 → 9326.30] which is why we are where we are.
[9326.30 → 9331.14] Tech debt is like not doing proper maintenance or falling behind on,
[9331.14 → 9335.20] on versions or revisions of different pieces of software or services that you use,
[9335.20 → 9338.90] or not keeping up with different frameworks that you should be using.
[9338.90 → 9342.08] Like maybe you're using one that gets basically deprecated,
[9342.08 → 9343.46] if not actually deprecated,
[9343.46 → 9345.42] like maybe the original developers are like,
[9345.42 → 9345.58] oh,
[9345.58 → 9346.56] we're still working on it.
[9346.62 → 9349.78] Just that you only ever see commits like once a year or something.
[9350.88 → 9351.36] Yeah.
[9354.06 → 9354.54] Okay.
[9354.66 → 9355.28] Next up.
[9355.28 → 9359.48] I saw Colton at my local mall the other week.
[9359.60 → 9361.14] I wasn't sure if I should approach him.
[9361.60 → 9362.42] It made me think,
[9362.52 → 9368.02] what is the typical etiquette expectations for those less in the limelight that work at LMG?
[9368.94 → 9369.80] Good question.
[9370.06 → 9371.24] Those less in the limelight.
[9371.30 → 9372.16] Why don't you answer it?
[9372.90 → 9373.82] Was it our etiquette?
[9373.86 → 9375.30] I wasn't sure if he was talking about himself.
[9375.46 → 9375.56] Yeah,
[9375.58 → 9375.78] himself.
[9377.10 → 9378.98] I don't really know.
[9378.98 → 9382.30] I've been trying to work through that in my own head.
[9382.30 → 9384.82] But it's awkward,
[9385.00 → 9385.36] I guess.
[9386.16 → 9390.68] I would like to assume that most people would appreciate the interaction,
[9391.12 → 9393.54] but probably just don't take forever.
[9394.40 → 9394.62] Yeah.
[9395.12 → 9399.84] I think that's the big one is sometimes people will approach you, and they'll say,
[9399.94 → 9400.00] hey,
[9400.00 → 9401.00] I don't want to take any of your time.
[9401.06 → 9404.98] And then they will proceed to take a bunch of your time and show you pictures of their cats and pictures of their computers.
[9404.98 → 9405.64] And it's like,
[9405.72 → 9407.74] that's fine,
[9407.74 → 9409.62] but there's a time and a place for it.
[9409.62 → 9412.60] And that time and place is at an officially sanctioned meetup.
[9412.78 → 9414.12] So I'll see you at LTX.
[9415.30 → 9420.78] Right now I'm meeting with my family, and I'm paying attention to them and not you.
[9420.90 → 9421.82] And I'm not working.
[9421.88 → 9424.52] Cause that's the thing is as much as I'm,
[9424.58 → 9424.72] I,
[9424.90 → 9425.12] you know,
[9425.64 → 9428.42] actually just am so blessed,
[9428.42 → 9428.70] right.
[9428.70 → 9431.16] To have this community that has rallied around us.
[9431.16 → 9431.46] And it's,
[9431.46 → 9432.72] it's like the coolest thing ever.
[9433.26 → 9434.50] This is my job.
[9434.50 → 9435.06] And like,
[9435.06 → 9438.50] I'm at work when I'm doing that.
[9439.18 → 9441.86] Sometimes I can choose to do it on my own personal time,
[9441.86 → 9443.78] but in the mall,
[9443.92 → 9444.58] I didn't,
[9445.10 → 9446.20] that wasn't my choice,
[9446.20 → 9446.56] right.
[9446.56 → 9446.92] That was,
[9447.00 → 9447.66] that was your choice.
[9447.66 → 9448.64] I wasn't in control.
[9448.86 → 9450.14] So with that in mind,
[9450.14 → 9451.90] I would say that in general,
[9452.12 → 9457.50] your best bet is because we also don't like being watched surreptitiously,
[9457.50 → 9458.28] right.
[9458.74 → 9459.78] I can tell.
[9460.74 → 9464.16] And just because I ignore you doesn't mean I can't tell.
[9465.88 → 9467.96] So we don't like that for sure.
[9468.32 → 9469.74] So your best bet is,
[9470.14 → 9470.48] you know,
[9470.88 → 9471.22] Hey,
[9471.26 → 9472.00] love your videos.
[9472.74 → 9473.50] See you later.
[9473.96 → 9478.74] I would personally always rather know if you're going to be stuck in the same
[9478.74 → 9480.50] vicinity as me for a while.
[9480.72 → 9485.12] I would personally appreciate if you earlier rather than later.
[9485.26 → 9485.54] Yes.
[9485.76 → 9485.90] Yeah.
[9485.90 → 9486.76] If you acknowledge,
[9486.92 → 9487.40] yeah.
[9487.50 → 9487.88] Um,
[9487.88 → 9488.50] and if you're like,
[9488.50 → 9489.48] I'm feeling awkward.
[9489.54 → 9490.42] I don't really know what to say.
[9490.46 → 9491.42] Even just the like,
[9492.56 → 9492.72] Hey,
[9492.72 → 9493.22] love your videos.
[9493.28 → 9493.38] Hey,
[9493.38 → 9493.96] love the WAN show.
[9494.02 → 9494.14] Hey,
[9494.14 → 9494.98] love your thumbnails,
[9495.20 → 9496.20] whatever it ends up being,
[9496.28 → 9497.86] or just that like a
[9497.96 → 9498.06] Hey,
[9498.08 → 9498.94] I see you.
[9499.00 → 9500.12] Cause then like,
[9500.40 → 9500.94] I don't know.
[9501.40 → 9502.00] I know.
[9502.46 → 9503.26] And that's cool.
[9503.92 → 9504.06] Yeah.
[9504.08 → 9506.04] That's I appreciate knowing personally.
[9506.20 → 9506.50] And like,
[9506.50 → 9507.46] I think at this point,
[9507.46 → 9511.66] it's pretty fair for someone like me or Luke to assume that we're being listened to
[9511.66 → 9512.12] in public.
[9512.38 → 9513.06] So we,
[9513.10 → 9514.68] we try to speak in coded language.
[9514.68 → 9516.80] If we need to talk about anything that's confidential,
[9516.80 → 9518.58] whether it's regarding product or,
[9518.58 → 9519.14] uh,
[9519.14 → 9522.50] the internal workings of minus media group or float plane or whatever else.
[9522.86 → 9523.20] Uh,
[9523.20 → 9524.40] but it's still not,
[9524.48 → 9525.30] everyone's going to do it.
[9525.30 → 9527.32] It's still good for us to know,
[9527.40 → 9528.60] know that,
[9528.68 → 9529.28] you know,
[9529.28 → 9535.06] whatever I'm saying could be posted on Reddit in 30 minutes or less.
[9535.06 → 9536.26] And even if that's like,
[9536.32 → 9537.38] obviously not your intention,
[9537.38 → 9538.88] it's still just nice to know,
[9538.92 → 9540.90] because if I end up figuring it out way later on,
[9540.90 → 9542.12] I'm going to feel very awkward.
[9542.12 → 9542.98] And uncomfortable,
[9543.22 → 9543.82] like wondering.
[9544.06 → 9546.28] And now I have to run through everything that I just said,
[9546.36 → 9548.16] since I've been in this area or whatever else.
[9548.16 → 9548.58] And it's,
[9548.64 → 9549.50] it's a little uncomfortable.
[9552.56 → 9553.04] Okay.
[9553.22 → 9553.94] Next up.
[9554.60 → 9555.08] Hi Linus.
[9555.08 → 9559.90] I work at SAS company that specializes in software for the gym industry.
[9560.26 → 9562.18] As you've worked towards opening your club,
[9562.24 → 9564.38] is there any technology that surprised you?
[9567.08 → 9567.56] Surprised?
[9567.56 → 9574.32] I'm very surprised at how behind the times the public address industry seems to be.
[9574.70 → 9578.70] It is very much dominated by contractors,
[9579.04 → 9580.18] value added resellers.
[9580.60 → 9580.70] It's,
[9580.70 → 9582.34] it's like completely ass backwards.
[9582.90 → 9583.18] What do you mean?
[9583.22 → 9583.44] PA.
[9584.46 → 9585.08] Like public address.
[9585.32 → 9585.60] Oh,
[9586.00 → 9586.26] okay.
[9586.38 → 9586.56] Yeah.
[9586.74 → 9586.88] Yeah.
[9587.22 → 9587.70] Um,
[9587.76 → 9588.12] really?
[9588.34 → 9588.62] Yeah.
[9588.74 → 9588.98] The
[9589.04 → 9591.94] the fact that it isn't just commodity,
[9592.74 → 9594.18] inexpensive hardware,
[9594.18 → 9597.54] and just some IP based thing that,
[9597.56 → 9604.66] just this thing on and just goes is mind-blowing to me.
[9604.84 → 9609.74] The fact that they want like subscription services and cloud this and whatever that
[9609.74 → 9609.92] like,
[9609.92 → 9612.02] you could make one so easy to be clear.
[9612.02 → 9614.16] There are situations where that would make sense.
[9614.16 → 9617.68] If you're going to have a hundred different zones, and you're going to need like a team of
[9617.68 → 9618.40] three operators,
[9618.40 → 9619.96] because you're at some stadium or whatever,
[9619.96 → 9621.34] and you could be paging multiple things,
[9621.38 → 9621.88] whatever,
[9622.08 → 9622.24] right?
[9622.24 → 9624.48] Like there are situations where that makes sense.
[9624.70 → 9627.16] But the fact that there isn't just,
[9627.28 → 9627.42] you know,
[9627.42 → 9628.30] aside from just,
[9628.30 → 9629.42] you know,
[9629.42 → 9632.02] running a long cable to your karaoke machine,
[9632.14 → 9632.36] right?
[9632.74 → 9635.28] The fact that there isn't just kind of basic one,
[9635.36 → 9640.66] at least that my contractors were able to find was mind-blowing to me.
[9641.56 → 9642.00] Um,
[9642.64 → 9644.82] Knapp's says in float plane chat,
[9644.90 → 9646.90] didn't Ubiquity try to get into public address?
[9646.90 → 9648.40] I don't know.
[9648.76 → 9651.38] But based on my experiences with their products so far,
[9651.38 → 9653.26] I would love for them to do that.
[9653.32 → 9654.06] They're not cheap,
[9654.06 → 9656.14] but they're a lot cheaper.
[9656.14 → 9656.40] Like,
[9656.46 → 9656.58] man,
[9656.80 → 9657.66] I got quoted.
[9658.10 → 9658.50] I,
[9658.62 → 9658.86] I,
[9658.86 → 9659.26] I,
[9659.26 → 9660.70] I can't even find that.
[9660.76 → 9661.04] Basically,
[9661.04 → 9664.18] I got quoted like tens of thousands of dollars for,
[9664.18 → 9665.34] and it was like a dozen,
[9665.58 → 9665.70] Oh,
[9665.78 → 9665.92] no,
[9666.00 → 9668.50] maybe like 16 speakers or something like that.
[9668.64 → 9668.84] And,
[9669.32 → 9669.96] um,
[9670.84 → 9671.22] whatever.
[9671.30 → 9671.78] The point is,
[9671.80 → 9672.06] it was,
[9672.14 → 9673.34] it was outlandish,
[9673.84 → 9675.94] like absolutely ridiculous.
[9675.94 → 9679.48] These speakers were like 300 plus dollars each,
[9679.48 → 9681.42] even though they were just speakers,
[9681.42 → 9683.66] there was no smartness in the speaker.
[9684.62 → 9685.06] I,
[9685.30 → 9685.90] uh,
[9685.90 → 9686.18] blah,
[9686.24 → 9686.36] blah,
[9686.44 → 9686.62] blah.
[9686.74 → 9687.50] First party vendor,
[9687.62 → 9687.70] blah,
[9687.76 → 9687.84] blah.
[9687.88 → 9688.42] I don't care.
[9688.46 → 9690.26] I just need anything that vibrates.
[9690.26 → 9691.66] Um,
[9691.88 → 9692.20] so I,
[9692.20 → 9693.02] I was pretty annoyed.
[9695.68 → 9696.16] Sure.
[9696.36 → 9698.42] It was just replying to a new incoming one.
[9698.68 → 9699.50] All right.
[9699.56 → 9700.16] Next up.
[9701.04 → 9706.56] My whiz smart light bulbs recently updated and a new feature they added was motion sensing.
[9706.72 → 9710.46] They say it uses Wi-Fi signals to disruption,
[9710.88 → 9713.08] a Wi-Fi signal disruption to sense movement.
[9713.28 → 9714.40] How does this work?
[9714.42 → 9715.58] And why isn't it more prevalent?
[9716.18 → 9717.96] I have no idea.
[9719.14 → 9720.24] And it would be incredible.
[9720.26 → 9721.20] It's incredibly hard to detect,
[9721.32 → 9721.68] but you're,
[9721.78 → 9722.68] I have no idea.
[9722.92 → 9725.70] Fleshy body does interact with waves through the air.
[9725.78 → 9726.18] So like,
[9726.34 → 9730.04] I don't know how the heck you would measure that.
[9730.10 → 9731.08] Like consistently.
[9731.38 → 9732.90] I understand it's a thing that happens,
[9733.04 → 9734.32] but I don't know how you detect it.
[9734.34 → 9735.06] Like if it's in a
[9735.06 → 9736.30] if it's in a desk lamp,
[9736.42 → 9736.64] right?
[9736.72 → 9736.90] Like,
[9736.96 → 9737.06] or,
[9737.12 → 9737.76] or like a
[9737.76 → 9738.16] a
[9738.16 → 9739.10] a bedside lamp,
[9739.10 → 9743.44] how does it tell the difference between a very close cat or a heart,
[9743.48 → 9744.22] a far human?
[9744.34 → 9744.52] I,
[9744.60 → 9745.34] I don't know.
[9747.70 → 9748.44] I have no idea.
[9748.54 → 9748.64] I mean,
[9748.64 → 9749.90] I believe it could be done.
[9749.90 → 9750.22] Yeah.
[9750.28 → 9751.42] I just don't know how you do it.
[9753.26 → 9754.02] It's weird.
[9754.84 → 9755.86] It's just weird.
[9757.28 → 9757.68] Okay.
[9757.78 → 9758.24] Next up.
[9758.86 → 9763.10] The destroyed van that was hit by the concrete at the launch pad is still transmitting.
[9763.48 → 9764.70] It was our camera van,
[9764.84 → 9765.84] NASA space flight.
[9765.84 → 9768.72] We still can't go to the pad to collect it yet though.
[9768.84 → 9768.98] Oh,
[9769.04 → 9769.38] hilarious.
[9769.64 → 9770.44] Enjoy your tech set.
[9770.54 → 9770.66] Oh,
[9770.76 → 9772.02] so it was actually theirs.
[9773.16 → 9773.46] Yeah.
[9773.86 → 9774.06] Yeah.
[9774.06 → 9775.38] So it isn't external,
[9775.58 → 9775.80] whatever,
[9775.92 → 9776.18] whatever.
[9776.90 → 9777.20] Well,
[9777.30 → 9777.44] yeah,
[9777.44 → 9778.86] but no one said external.
[9778.86 → 9780.18] They just said no other damage.
[9780.80 → 9780.96] Oh yeah.
[9780.96 → 9781.66] That wasn't a question.
[9781.74 → 9782.84] I just thought that was fun to include.
[9783.00 → 9783.14] No.
[9783.14 → 9783.48] Because I,
[9783.66 → 9784.20] someone in,
[9784.20 → 9786.60] in float plane chat or Twitch chat or something.
[9786.66 → 9788.16] I don't remember which one was like,
[9788.20 → 9788.44] Oh,
[9788.70 → 9788.92] they,
[9788.98 → 9790.38] they claimed it wasn't,
[9790.38 → 9792.18] there was no like external damage done.
[9792.44 → 9792.88] It's like,
[9792.90 → 9793.04] yeah.
[9793.14 → 9793.34] Oh,
[9793.40 → 9793.84] well there wasn't.
[9793.92 → 9794.66] It was their own van.
[9795.14 → 9795.46] Oh,
[9795.46 → 9796.74] you talked about the launch pad though.
[9796.74 → 9797.56] It's like damage.
[9797.82 → 9798.04] Yeah.
[9798.16 → 9798.38] Yeah.
[9798.38 → 9798.68] Sorry.
[9798.80 → 9799.18] They were,
[9799.40 → 9800.04] they were saying,
[9800.18 → 9800.32] Oh,
[9800.36 → 9800.56] okay.
[9800.62 → 9800.78] I,
[9800.88 → 9802.36] I misunderstood you earlier then.
[9802.42 → 9802.68] Okay.
[9802.76 → 9803.20] So then,
[9803.28 → 9803.68] all right.
[9804.14 → 9804.42] Wait,
[9804.48 → 9804.70] what?
[9804.80 → 9805.04] No,
[9805.06 → 9805.74] I don't think you did.
[9805.86 → 9807.42] I think you're misunderstanding me now.
[9808.54 → 9809.44] I don't think so.
[9809.56 → 9809.96] Okay.
[9810.20 → 9810.72] Because I,
[9810.90 → 9816.60] earlier what I thought you were saying was that someone else was saying that there was no damage to anything other than the rocket.
[9816.60 → 9817.54] That's what the doc said.
[9818.38 → 9818.78] Oh,
[9819.16 → 9819.96] well then that's not true.
[9820.68 → 9821.08] Correct.
[9821.32 → 9822.44] Cause that van was damaged.
[9823.08 → 9823.48] Yes.
[9823.56 → 9824.58] NASA space flights van.
[9824.76 → 9825.46] And the platform.
[9825.62 → 9825.86] Yes.
[9826.12 → 9826.76] Which is what I said.
[9827.02 → 9827.46] Then we're good.
[9827.70 → 9827.90] Yeah.
[9828.38 → 9830.48] We got there.
[9830.68 → 9832.48] I like it better when mom and dad fight.
[9833.72 → 9834.82] This is awful.
[9834.94 → 9836.56] Stop being so agreeable.
[9837.60 → 9837.88] Uh,
[9838.16 → 9838.70] all right.
[9838.74 → 9839.30] Next up.
[9839.84 → 9840.28] Hi Linus.
[9840.34 → 9842.42] What are some crucial tips or advice for,
[9842.66 → 9843.56] also NASA space flight is a
[9843.78 → 9844.02] Oh,
[9844.62 → 9844.92] wow.
[9845.02 → 9846.50] That's a very confusing name,
[9846.80 → 9848.30] but cool.
[9848.40 → 9849.70] And I follow you on Twitter.
[9849.70 → 9850.28] I'm pretty sure.
[9850.52 → 9850.76] Neat.
[9851.22 → 9852.30] I thought it was official.
[9853.18 → 9853.60] Uh,
[9853.72 → 9857.54] what are some crucial tips or advice for a new company to make a product?
[9857.54 → 9860.32] How do you go from prototype to finding a manufacturer?
[9860.46 → 9862.12] What are some big mistakes to avoid?
[9862.48 → 9865.48] There are so many questions today that are like six questions in one.
[9865.60 → 9865.82] Yeah.
[9866.02 → 9867.62] I try and not to,
[9867.76 → 9870.34] I think what I'm going to be doing in my text responses,
[9870.34 → 9872.62] I've been ignoring anything past the first question.
[9872.62 → 9872.90] Okay.
[9872.90 → 9875.86] I think we're going to have to make it one question per merch message.
[9875.86 → 9876.90] It's actually getting like,
[9877.02 → 9879.30] I just answered one that was like four questions.
[9879.42 → 9879.60] Yeah.
[9879.74 → 9880.22] Whoa.
[9880.56 → 9880.86] Uh,
[9880.86 → 9883.42] so some crucial tips and advice for a new company to make a product.
[9883.80 → 9884.22] Uh,
[9884.24 → 9886.28] I think the biggest one is don't rush.
[9887.10 → 9891.52] Don't launch it until it's ready because you will regret it.
[9892.14 → 9895.86] It's recalls are so much more expensive than another round of sampling.
[9897.06 → 9898.10] That's the bottom line.
[9898.22 → 9898.58] That's the
[9898.68 → 9900.94] that's the biggest piece of advice that I can give you.
[9900.94 → 9904.18] Dan,
[9904.22 → 9905.24] I'm not addressing the other two.
[9905.74 → 9906.08] Okay.
[9906.42 → 9906.96] Hit me,
[9907.04 → 9907.18] Dan.
[9907.30 → 9907.50] Lol.
[9908.20 → 9908.64] Uh,
[9908.68 → 9908.92] okay.
[9908.98 → 9911.98] Since you mentioned a keyboard and mouse is better than a controller,
[9911.98 → 9917.74] how would you prove it to a stubborn non-techie friend that doesn't understand that it is?
[9917.94 → 9919.24] In cases like shooters,
[9919.34 → 9919.60] at least.
[9921.04 → 9927.28] I would say that if whoever it is does not accept the
[9927.28 → 9928.18] the
[9928.18 → 9931.32] the superior control of a mouse in particular,
[9931.32 → 9934.62] I don't think that a keyboard is especially superior to an analog joystick.
[9935.34 → 9935.78] Um,
[9936.18 → 9936.86] and you know,
[9936.88 → 9939.98] all the other things that your fingers could do on some kind of controller.
[9940.38 → 9940.78] Um,
[9940.78 → 9941.26] but if they,
[9941.34 → 9941.68] if they,
[9941.78 → 9943.66] if they can't grasp,
[9943.66 → 9944.58] uh,
[9944.58 → 9948.70] the finer control that a mouse affords compared to a stick,
[9948.70 → 9949.54] um,
[9949.54 → 9956.92] there's probably just not really much that you can tell them or show them that would change their mind because this is no longer a rational conversation.
[9956.92 → 9957.32] Um,
[9957.32 → 9958.88] it's an emotional conversation.
[9958.88 → 9959.28] Um,
[9959.28 → 9962.64] and the more you try to contradict them at that point,
[9962.64 → 9963.52] um,
[9963.70 → 9964.00] the
[9964.06 → 9967.10] the deeper they're going to dig in if they behave like a
[9967.30 → 9968.64] like a person often does.
[9968.80 → 9971.80] And since this sounds like from your tone,
[9971.80 → 9976.04] it's a conversation that you've had multiple times before.
[9976.04 → 9979.30] I would say that if you weren't successful before,
[9979.30 → 9982.92] you're probably unlikely to be successful, and it might be better to just drop the subject.
[9983.64 → 9983.86] Um,
[9984.28 → 9992.40] my experience that leads me to that advice is that I have been in a committed relationship for 18 years.
[9993.26 → 9993.66] No,
[9993.70 → 9993.98] I'm kidding.
[9994.06 → 9994.38] Actually,
[9994.48 → 9996.62] Yvonne's very easy to get along with, and she's quite rational,
[9996.76 → 9999.28] which makes my life much better.
[9999.88 → 10000.26] Um,
[10001.02 → 10001.82] but yeah,
[10001.84 → 10002.74] not much you can do about it.
[10003.08 → 10004.24] I'm going to interject with one.
[10004.24 → 10006.02] This was in potentials from anonymous,
[10006.22 → 10010.16] just got back from H I M M S a health tech con in the U S.
[10010.30 → 10014.60] It was a lot of privacy and security experts talking about AI this year.
[10014.70 → 10019.00] They recommend silting LLMs or building them custom for health.
[10019.30 → 10020.32] Any thoughts?
[10021.58 → 10022.26] Called it.
[10022.34 → 10024.04] This guy got him.
[10024.68 → 10025.82] He called it.
[10026.98 → 10027.54] Yeah.
[10027.60 → 10029.50] That's a hundred percent going to be a thing.
[10029.68 → 10031.24] So there you go.
[10032.96 → 10033.52] Okay.
[10033.52 → 10034.54] Next up.
[10036.04 → 10036.16] Hey,
[10036.20 → 10036.54] DLL.
[10036.82 → 10041.16] I'm a U S truck driver who has been listening to the WAN show while I drive for a long time.
[10041.44 → 10046.72] What are your thoughts on self-driving semi trucks and the possible impacts on jobs or road safety?
[10047.98 → 10048.38] Oh,
[10048.84 → 10049.60] Oh my.
[10050.10 → 10051.18] So this is tough,
[10051.24 → 10051.42] right?
[10051.46 → 10053.38] Because I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
[10053.50 → 10054.24] but it's coming.
[10054.60 → 10054.92] Oh yeah.
[10054.92 → 10055.72] Um,
[10055.72 → 10058.56] and this is another really tough conversation,
[10058.56 → 10058.82] right?
[10058.88 → 10060.44] Because when we talk safety,
[10060.56 → 10064.00] we have to talk safety from a statistical standpoint,
[10064.00 → 10064.46] right?
[10064.94 → 10071.24] So autonomous semis could be safer,
[10071.24 → 10077.64] even if people die as a result of their widespread adoption,
[10077.64 → 10080.18] which is hard to wrap your brain around,
[10080.24 → 10080.38] right?
[10080.42 → 10085.32] Because what we'd like to think is that these autonomous vehicles could reach a level of
[10085.32 → 10087.14] perfection in their,
[10087.24 → 10088.06] in their operation,
[10088.20 → 10088.40] right?
[10088.40 → 10090.64] But that's not realistic.
[10091.12 → 10092.96] And even if they're not perfect,
[10093.52 → 10096.36] as long as they're better than not necessarily you,
[10096.64 → 10099.30] you might be a great driver who would never make a mistake.
[10100.90 → 10104.02] But as long as they're better than the average,
[10104.60 → 10107.04] the transition could make sense.
[10107.20 → 10109.12] And what we also know,
[10109.36 → 10109.66] thank you,
[10109.74 → 10110.10] capitalism,
[10110.38 → 10116.64] is that even if they aren't quite better than the average companies looking to save a buck will be
[10116.64 → 10120.24] just champing at the bit to adopt them.
[10120.76 → 10121.86] So they're coming,
[10122.64 → 10123.10] um,
[10123.78 → 10126.28] regardless of the impact on road safety to,
[10126.42 → 10129.04] to a degree as for the impacts on jobs,
[10129.08 → 10137.70] I think both Luke and I are whatever the word is for people who kind of take an adept or die stance.
[10138.06 → 10138.42] Um,
[10139.26 → 10141.72] AI is coming for creative jobs too at this point.
[10141.78 → 10141.86] Hey,
[10141.90 → 10143.26] I thought we had a lot more time,
[10143.74 → 10144.84] but we're staring at,
[10145.02 → 10146.04] we're staring down,
[10146.04 → 10147.82] the gun barrel going,
[10148.32 → 10148.58] okay,
[10148.60 → 10148.76] well,
[10148.80 → 10150.30] let's act now or die.
[10150.72 → 10152.26] And we choose to act,
[10152.32 → 10152.50] right?
[10152.64 → 10159.14] So there are songs right now where people have spoofed Drake's voice, and they're like popular and people listen to them.
[10159.38 → 10159.66] Yep.
[10162.66 → 10163.98] It's coming for us all.
[10165.34 → 10165.82] Yeah,
[10165.84 → 10166.44] we've got,
[10166.56 → 10166.88] uh,
[10167.34 → 10167.84] this is,
[10167.96 → 10168.12] uh,
[10168.12 → 10168.54] this is,
[10168.54 → 10169.76] this is someone there.
[10170.14 → 10170.78] It's a
[10170.78 → 10171.78] someone in Twitch chat.
[10171.86 → 10174.10] There will always be an operator.
[10174.10 → 10175.32] Think trains,
[10175.48 → 10176.26] think planes.
[10177.12 → 10177.52] No,
[10177.78 → 10178.62] there won't.
[10179.88 → 10181.12] Not necessarily.
[10185.12 → 10185.76] Okay.
[10186.52 → 10188.00] That's a scary one.
[10189.26 → 10190.80] Let's move on.
[10190.94 → 10191.34] Uh,
[10191.34 → 10191.66] Hey,
[10191.66 → 10191.68] Hey,
[10191.76 → 10192.66] DLL with the
[10193.12 → 10196.56] with it being possible to hide a Trojan attack in USB devices,
[10196.56 → 10198.26] such as a drive or keyboard.
[10198.44 → 10203.14] Do you think there's a concern that cheap USB products from unknown companies could be malicious?
[10203.14 → 10206.78] We've got a great video coming on the OMG cable.
[10207.38 → 10209.18] Really spooky device.
[10209.58 → 10210.56] Are you familiar with that one?
[10210.82 → 10211.90] I recognize it,
[10211.96 → 10212.68] but I don't think so.
[10212.80 → 10214.20] It's basically a rubber ducky,
[10214.40 → 10219.62] but in the form of a completely nondescript USB cable.
[10220.52 → 10224.56] It doesn't look like it's capable of carrying any sort of payload.
[10225.32 → 10225.76] Um,
[10225.76 → 10226.52] I just looked it up.
[10226.72 → 10226.92] Yeah.
[10226.92 → 10227.52] Oh my God.
[10227.58 → 10227.72] Yeah.
[10227.72 → 10231.66] Tanner's been playing around with it over the course of this week, and it's going to be a wild video.
[10231.66 → 10231.98] It's,
[10232.08 → 10232.34] um,
[10232.46 → 10235.78] it's going to blow people's minds if they haven't heard of it.
[10235.96 → 10236.08] Yeah.
[10236.16 → 10236.30] No,
[10236.32 → 10237.24] it's like terrible.
[10238.04 → 10238.34] Okay.
[10238.38 → 10238.72] So,
[10238.72 → 10239.14] uh,
[10239.52 → 10241.98] USB condoms are going to become a more of a thing now.
[10242.04 → 10242.34] Yeah.
[10242.44 → 10242.96] A hundred percent.
[10243.04 → 10244.24] We need to distribute those.
[10244.56 → 10244.82] Yeah.
[10244.90 → 10249.66] Could we put the OMG cable in a USB condom and then distribute those and then screw people over that way?
[10249.98 → 10251.66] What are you even talking about?
[10252.48 → 10252.88] Ah,
[10253.18 → 10254.10] nothing is safe.
[10254.28 → 10254.82] Nothing is safe.
[10256.34 → 10256.70] Oh,
[10257.06 → 10257.46] great.
[10257.46 → 10257.98] I think he's,
[10258.10 → 10258.74] I think they're,
[10258.84 → 10259.84] they're devices where it,
[10259.86 → 10261.36] it just passes through power pins,
[10261.46 → 10261.50] right?
[10261.50 → 10261.76] That's right.
[10261.88 → 10262.06] Yeah.
[10262.42 → 10262.66] Yeah.
[10262.66 → 10264.40] So it doesn't allow for data transfer.
[10264.52 → 10267.56] So if you want to go to like a public spot or something like that,
[10267.56 → 10268.96] you can be a little bit more safe.
[10269.22 → 10269.38] Yeah.
[10270.44 → 10270.92] Uh,
[10272.12 → 10272.36] okay.
[10272.46 → 10272.92] Next up.
[10273.24 → 10273.48] Hey,
[10273.54 → 10274.12] Linus and Luke,
[10274.16 → 10281.02] if you could have one tech tip telepathically messaged to every person on earth in whatever language they understand,
[10281.82 → 10282.42] um,
[10283.22 → 10284.64] turn it off and turn it back on.
[10284.78 → 10285.06] Yeah,
[10285.16 → 10285.54] I guess.
[10285.54 → 10286.16] Let's go.
[10287.44 → 10288.52] What would it be?
[10288.76 → 10289.28] All right.
[10289.28 → 10289.78] Uh,
[10289.78 → 10292.42] I guess if you push in new ones,
[10292.46 → 10293.60] it pushes them down for me.
[10294.18 → 10294.48] Um,
[10295.00 → 10295.78] saving for backpack.
[10295.94 → 10297.36] Last one lasted 14 years.
[10297.54 → 10299.60] I'm sure the LTT one will as well.
[10299.94 → 10300.04] Hey,
[10300.08 → 10300.26] Luke,
[10300.30 → 10301.76] if your current car were to go kaput,
[10302.14 → 10304.44] what would be on your short list for replacement?
[10304.90 → 10305.78] I don't know.
[10306.30 → 10307.50] My car will never die.
[10308.30 → 10308.56] Yeah.
[10308.72 → 10308.96] It's,
[10309.14 → 10310.22] it's a Honda.
[10310.34 → 10310.94] It's a Honda.
[10310.94 → 10313.56] It's never going to die.
[10316.26 → 10316.70] Yeah.
[10317.10 → 10317.80] But if it did,
[10318.30 → 10319.02] uh,
[10319.14 → 10320.26] probably no fault of its own.
[10320.46 → 10320.86] Probably.
[10321.60 → 10322.08] Probably.
[10322.24 → 10325.04] That's probably more likely to be completely honest.
[10325.48 → 10325.92] Um,
[10327.20 → 10327.40] uh,
[10327.40 → 10328.72] probably another one.
[10330.62 → 10331.38] Same age.
[10331.44 → 10333.46] It would also be mint Honda boy.
[10333.60 → 10334.06] Honda boy.
[10334.18 → 10334.54] Same age.
[10334.60 → 10334.72] Yeah.
[10334.72 → 10337.06] Probably not the actual same generation,
[10337.06 → 10339.62] but I do like certain things about it.
[10339.82 → 10340.30] Um,
[10340.38 → 10340.84] about it,
[10340.88 → 10341.78] like not being,
[10341.98 → 10342.30] uh,
[10342.30 → 10342.96] uh,
[10342.96 → 10345.06] a modern car in some ways.
[10345.50 → 10346.86] Not having Android auto sucks.
[10347.00 → 10348.28] That part does kind of suck,
[10348.42 → 10350.70] but I do also just have a phone.
[10351.38 → 10353.28] So it's not the worst thing in the world.
[10355.72 → 10358.38] Someone said it's supposed to buy my 2020 TLX.
[10358.50 → 10358.72] Yeah.
[10358.98 → 10359.28] Yeah.
[10359.28 → 10359.94] That's funny.
[10360.14 → 10361.48] I don't think I'm actually going to do that,
[10361.48 → 10362.40] but yeah.
[10362.84 → 10363.28] Um,
[10363.66 → 10367.04] someone mentioned that they have a 2020 TLX in the exact,
[10367.06 → 10367.84] colour that I want,
[10367.90 → 10368.68] which is like the same,
[10368.72 → 10369.96] but modern version of mine.
[10370.40 → 10370.88] I'm like,
[10370.90 → 10371.88] that's kind of cool,
[10371.94 → 10373.04] but I don't want to do that.
[10373.54 → 10373.88] Um,
[10374.28 → 10375.50] yeah,
[10375.56 → 10376.22] I don't know.
[10376.34 → 10376.56] I,
[10376.66 → 10382.84] I really like my current car and I fit in it well.
[10383.04 → 10383.56] And I,
[10383.56 → 10384.74] I'm like decently tall,
[10384.74 → 10388.38] but I'm also just a very weird proportion.
[10388.70 → 10388.82] Yeah.
[10388.82 → 10391.08] He has like legs that are the same length as mine.
[10391.08 → 10393.08] In spite of the fact that he's like eight inches,
[10393.20 → 10394.20] nine inches taller than me.
[10394.34 → 10394.66] Yeah.
[10394.68 → 10394.90] My,
[10394.94 → 10396.16] my torso is like,
[10396.16 → 10398.54] is ridiculously tall.
[10398.66 → 10400.60] We have to compensate by boosting my chair.
[10401.02 → 10401.28] Yeah.
[10401.58 → 10402.02] Uh,
[10402.02 → 10402.66] but my legs,
[10402.72 → 10404.38] like my legs are actually not very long.
[10404.48 → 10405.80] My torso is just really,
[10405.94 → 10406.76] really long.
[10407.62 → 10408.54] So when I,
[10408.64 → 10411.82] sitting in cars is like a particularly annoying thing for me,
[10411.82 → 10412.60] uh,
[10412.60 → 10414.44] because my head will always be in the roof.
[10414.94 → 10415.34] Um,
[10415.40 → 10419.48] there are cars that even with like the best I can do with setting up the seat,
[10419.48 → 10423.94] I have to pull the sunroof back and shove my head up in the sunroof so that I can sit properly.
[10424.64 → 10425.12] Um,
[10425.20 → 10436.36] I'm pretty particular about like the fit in the car and my Acura is legitimately like pretty much the best I've ever dealt with.
[10436.36 → 10441.32] So unless they've screwed that up in the many years since mine was made,
[10441.46 → 10442.88] because mine's at 2009,
[10443.00 → 10443.98] which means it was,
[10444.06 → 10444.30] you know,
[10444.34 → 10445.70] probably made in 2008.
[10446.28 → 10446.68] Um,
[10447.44 → 10447.74] uh,
[10447.74 → 10448.60] it's very,
[10448.74 → 10449.74] it's very possible.
[10449.74 → 10450.38] They've screwed it up,
[10450.42 → 10451.12] but I sort of doubt it.
[10451.26 → 10453.56] They don't make actually just TLs anymore.
[10453.66 → 10454.56] They make TLXs,
[10454.60 → 10455.28] which is the
[10455.28 → 10458.26] the other one and TL merged together.
[10458.40 → 10459.78] So maybe they have screwed it up,
[10459.84 → 10460.40] but I don't know.
[10460.48 → 10460.76] We'll see.
[10461.18 → 10463.78] Hopefully I don't have to choose anytime soon because my car is never going to die.
[10464.24 → 10465.86] So it is what it is.
[10466.40 → 10467.02] We can all hope.
[10468.08 → 10468.36] Okay.
[10468.38 → 10468.78] Next up.
[10469.40 → 10470.50] What is your top,
[10470.80 → 10472.42] top tech product,
[10472.62 → 10475.30] non-LTT and new game you can't wait for?
[10475.66 → 10475.96] Uh,
[10475.96 → 10476.86] that's another two questions.
[10477.22 → 10478.66] Thanks for the infotainment.
[10478.90 → 10481.64] More hot and lukewarm takes,
[10481.76 → 10482.00] please.
[10482.00 → 10483.68] I'm struggling today.
[10484.16 → 10484.60] Honestly,
[10484.68 → 10487.04] my top tech product right now has got to be the DOG ally.
[10487.48 → 10488.84] I'm really excited for it.
[10488.88 → 10490.36] Double the performance of the steam deck.
[10490.46 → 10491.24] It's so much quieter.
[10491.36 → 10495.34] I can't emphasize enough how much quieter it is and how important that is to me.
[10495.70 → 10496.14] Um,
[10496.24 → 10497.34] I finally played stray.
[10498.24 → 10498.90] It's fine.
[10499.66 → 10500.62] A little overhyped,
[10500.98 → 10501.94] but I,
[10501.94 → 10502.26] I,
[10502.26 → 10502.48] I,
[10502.66 → 10502.96] I,
[10502.96 → 10503.06] I,
[10503.06 → 10505.10] is it at least like a cool new take on a game?
[10505.50 → 10507.56] I enjoyed how little help it gave you.
[10507.86 → 10507.96] Cool.
[10508.32 → 10510.76] And I don't remember the last time.
[10510.76 → 10512.10] I really just,
[10512.24 → 10513.02] like,
[10513.06 → 10514.46] I just meowed for no reason.
[10514.46 → 10516.56] Like I was just role-playing a cat.
[10518.56 → 10519.12] Goose game.
[10519.64 → 10519.90] Yeah.
[10519.90 → 10521.28] But that was more just like,
[10521.28 → 10524.04] I was for a reason.
[10524.26 → 10524.90] Is that being a goose?
[10525.10 → 10526.10] It was to just be an**hole.
[10526.28 → 10526.98] Is that being a goose?
[10526.98 → 10527.48] I guess.
[10527.56 → 10527.78] Okay,
[10527.78 → 10528.06] sure.
[10528.12 → 10528.36] Fine.
[10528.36 → 10528.86] That's fair.
[10528.94 → 10529.46] That's fair.
[10529.66 → 10530.86] Then other than that,
[10531.18 → 10531.72] like I,
[10531.82 → 10532.32] I,
[10532.32 → 10533.62] I was really different.
[10533.70 → 10534.76] I will admit it is different.
[10534.94 → 10535.10] Yeah.
[10535.10 → 10535.26] I was,
[10535.30 → 10535.96] I was in my character.
[10535.96 → 10539.62] I played it in a combination of on the DOG ally.
[10539.88 → 10541.42] And then I also played it in the theatre room.
[10541.56 → 10550.22] I finally got my fibre optic connections running back to my computer so I can play in my theatre room without violating the spirit of the AMD challenge,
[10550.22 → 10551.36] which yes,
[10551.36 → 10552.58] is still on my radar,
[10552.70 → 10553.96] even though it's,
[10553.96 → 10555.26] it's been kind of a nothingburger.
[10555.74 → 10555.96] Yeah.
[10556.28 → 10556.44] Yeah.
[10556.44 → 10557.32] Is it still on your radar?
[10558.04 → 10560.70] It's been three months or something?
[10560.70 → 10561.50] I'm PC gaming.
[10562.02 → 10562.46] Okay.
[10562.46 → 10564.12] It's on my radar.
[10564.46 → 10565.50] And stray was perfect.
[10566.58 → 10566.94] In fact,
[10567.02 → 10567.88] stray was too perfect.
[10568.10 → 10568.94] On the ally,
[10569.12 → 10570.18] I'm very confused.
[10570.38 → 10582.18] All of my notes for this AMD challenge are going to be worthless because there will be so many driver revisions from when I did my testing and you and Jake finally get around to doing yours that it's not even going to make any sense.
[10582.26 → 10582.58] You know what?
[10582.68 → 10582.80] No,
[10582.86 → 10584.06] maybe that's part of the story though.
[10584.68 → 10585.28] The progression?
[10585.44 → 10585.58] Yeah.
[10586.00 → 10587.06] Maybe we just weave it in.
[10587.64 → 10588.48] There's always a way.
[10590.26 → 10591.30] We'll make it work.
[10592.46 → 10593.66] It's how we do.
[10597.10 → 10599.96] I got distracted by incoming again.
[10600.56 → 10601.76] Where is my brain today?
[10602.02 → 10602.44] Got him.
[10604.52 → 10605.14] Let's see.
[10605.50 → 10607.74] As a software dev manager of a hybrid,
[10608.02 → 10613.42] I feel my work's company push to get people back into the office is sidelining remote employees.
[10613.72 → 10615.16] How do you avoid the same issue,
[10615.30 → 10616.84] especially on the float plane side of things?
[10616.84 → 10617.70] Well,
[10617.82 → 10618.54] at LMG,
[10618.74 → 10620.52] we called everyone back to the office.
[10621.42 → 10621.70] So,
[10621.80 → 10623.28] actually,
[10623.34 → 10624.12] we do allow
[10624.12 → 10626.22] some work from home.
[10626.44 → 10630.42] The problem is that so much of what we do is not work from homeable.
[10630.52 → 10632.82] You actually cannot operate a camera from home.
[10632.82 → 10636.16] And in the interest of fairness,
[10636.16 → 10639.42] because you'd be amazed how petty and political things can get,
[10639.52 → 10640.88] even regarding things like,
[10640.94 → 10641.12] you know,
[10641.18 → 10644.12] which departments have which kinds of snacks in their snack supply.
[10646.20 → 10649.80] It's easier for us to have a policy that can be applied to everyone.
[10649.80 → 10651.48] And so,
[10652.32 → 10655.98] work from home is like on a pre-approval basis.
[10656.34 → 10656.66] It's not,
[10656.90 → 10659.02] or rather is on a per-approval basis,
[10659.02 → 10660.72] rather than just being pre-approved.
[10661.32 → 10663.00] And that's the way that we've handled it,
[10663.02 → 10664.92] is we've always been an in-the-office company.
[10665.04 → 10665.28] And so,
[10665.36 → 10666.66] we're in the office company again,
[10666.66 → 10668.22] now that it's no longer essential,
[10668.22 → 10670.64] from like a public health emergency standpoint,
[10670.94 → 10673.94] to do remote work.
[10674.26 → 10676.80] And the quality of the product is better.
[10677.60 → 10678.18] Simply put,
[10678.24 → 10678.76] it just is.
[10678.76 → 10685.08] Full plan has the same policies before COVID that we do now.
[10685.52 → 10687.36] We just went back to those.
[10691.60 → 10691.70] Okay.
[10693.60 → 10694.50] Enhancer says,
[10694.66 → 10696.70] no adult is amazed by work pettiness.
[10698.74 → 10702.24] The amount of drama that can be caused by a coffee machine,
[10702.48 → 10703.44] let me tell you.
[10705.32 → 10707.44] I wish one day they'll let me touch it.
[10708.24 → 10708.70] No.
[10709.34 → 10709.82] It's theirs.
[10710.36 → 10710.70] If I...
[10710.70 → 10711.60] I've never even seen it.
[10711.66 → 10714.66] If I see another complaint generated by that coffee machine,
[10714.74 → 10716.60] I will personally throw it in the garbage.
[10717.60 → 10718.16] Why...
[10718.16 → 10718.54] Personally.
[10718.86 → 10720.92] Why are people complaining about a coffee machine?
[10721.14 → 10721.90] It doesn't matter.
[10721.90 → 10723.36] If I see one.
[10723.50 → 10723.84] If I see one.
[10723.84 → 10724.50] If I see...
[10724.50 → 10727.66] If I hear another f***ING complaint about that coffee machine,
[10727.80 → 10728.68] I will throw it away.
[10728.98 → 10729.80] I will do it myself.
[10732.70 → 10733.18] Okay.
[10733.36 → 10733.48] Well,
[10733.50 → 10734.40] how about another merch message?
[10734.96 → 10735.40] Hey,
[10735.40 → 10736.30] Luke and Dan,
[10736.38 → 10737.92] and maybe Linus as well.
[10738.22 → 10740.38] In all of your years working at LTT,
[10740.60 → 10741.66] has Linus ever had an
[10741.86 → 10742.98] I'm Linus Sebastian,
[10743.08 → 10744.96] and this is my company moment?
[10744.96 → 10747.44] I curated this for you,
[10747.50 → 10749.94] because I was really curious about your response.
[10750.12 → 10750.30] Yeah,
[10750.34 → 10750.80] it's happened.
[10751.62 → 10752.02] Really?
[10752.16 → 10752.38] Okay.
[10752.58 → 10752.74] Yes.
[10752.96 → 10753.14] Yeah,
[10753.18 → 10753.92] it definitely has.
[10753.98 → 10754.74] More than once.
[10754.92 → 10755.48] I mean,
[10755.54 → 10755.80] yeah,
[10755.92 → 10758.52] I don't think I can recognize it.
[10758.52 → 10761.36] I will round this corner in a way that you might not expect,
[10761.46 → 10761.58] though,
[10761.62 → 10762.90] and say it's very uncommon.
[10763.48 → 10763.82] Okay.
[10764.10 → 10768.50] I think it would be probably less common than people watching would expect,
[10769.00 → 10770.46] but it does happen.
[10770.78 → 10771.22] I don't know.
[10772.26 → 10773.78] Sometimes you got to flex the veto power.
[10775.14 → 10776.22] Sometimes it's in,
[10776.34 → 10776.44] like,
[10776.64 → 10777.32] cool ways,
[10777.70 → 10778.30] where people,
[10778.62 → 10778.90] like,
[10779.06 → 10779.72] want you to.
[10780.16 → 10781.14] It's not always in cool ways,
[10781.54 → 10781.70] but,
[10781.70 → 10781.88] like,
[10781.94 → 10782.56] sometimes it is,
[10782.74 → 10782.94] where,
[10783.06 → 10783.20] like,
[10783.36 → 10784.24] everyone will be like,
[10784.48 → 10784.70] yeah,
[10784.74 → 10786.40] we probably shouldn't do this for,
[10786.54 → 10786.66] like,
[10786.68 → 10787.78] all these different reasons,
[10787.78 → 10788.76] but they all want to,
[10788.92 → 10789.22] but there's,
[10789.30 → 10789.36] like,
[10789.38 → 10791.20] a lot of logical reasons why we shouldn't do it,
[10791.30 → 10792.08] and you'll be like,
[10792.90 → 10793.50] screw it!
[10793.84 → 10794.72] We're doing it anyway!
[10794.94 → 10795.40] And it's like,
[10795.52 → 10795.76] yes!
[10796.54 → 10796.74] But,
[10796.90 → 10797.00] like,
[10797.32 → 10797.52] like,
[10798.04 → 10798.52] examples.
[10799.14 → 10801.18] I don't have great examples for this.
[10801.18 → 10802.34] Maybe Whale Land would be something like that.
[10802.34 → 10804.24] Whale Land would definitely be one of those versions.
[10804.56 → 10804.78] Yeah,
[10804.84 → 10805.02] like,
[10805.10 → 10806.48] this is a perfect example for that.
[10806.56 → 10808.36] A lot of people are going to come at you with the
[10808.84 → 10809.24] okay,
[10809.44 → 10809.78] well,
[10810.38 → 10813.34] I do business decision things at your company.
[10813.34 → 10816.34] I need to explain to you how many different ways this is dumb.
[10817.78 → 10818.22] And,
[10818.34 → 10818.52] like,
[10818.60 → 10819.56] we shouldn't do it.
[10819.80 → 10820.20] Technically,
[10820.34 → 10820.98] based off that.
[10821.58 → 10822.92] And then you can veto and go,
[10823.04 → 10823.10] like,
[10823.12 → 10823.20] well,
[10823.20 → 10823.90] we're doing it anyway,
[10824.00 → 10824.60] because it's cool,
[10824.70 → 10825.62] and I want to have a land.
[10826.16 → 10826.52] It's like,
[10826.56 → 10826.74] okay,
[10826.80 → 10826.98] sweet.
[10827.62 → 10827.80] Okay,
[10827.88 → 10829.86] but what about times I've done it that it's not cool?
[10830.06 → 10830.30] Yeah,
[10830.38 → 10831.82] I know this has happened,
[10832.38 → 10835.16] but I don't have an example right now,
[10835.24 → 10835.58] because,
[10835.70 → 10836.02] honestly,
[10836.20 → 10836.40] again,
[10836.44 → 10837.78] it doesn't happen that often.
[10838.00 → 10838.18] So,
[10838.26 → 10838.38] like,
[10838.40 → 10840.02] I don't think it's happened very recently,
[10840.14 → 10840.94] and I don't remember.
[10842.12 → 10842.80] It's happened,
[10842.90 → 10843.04] though.
[10843.04 → 10845.96] I don't know.
[10847.40 → 10848.32] It's just not that common.
[10848.58 → 10848.86] Weak.
[10849.50 → 10849.76] Dan,
[10849.92 → 10850.58] Dan,
[10850.60 → 10851.06] you got anything?
[10852.30 → 10852.64] Uh,
[10852.70 → 10853.00] no.
[10853.18 → 10855.98] I think you're very level-headed and reasonable.
[10856.32 → 10856.52] Oh,
[10856.56 → 10856.86] my God,
[10856.90 → 10857.74] don't be such a kiss-ass.
[10858.14 → 10859.04] I've only known you for,
[10859.14 → 10859.20] like,
[10859.22 → 10859.60] a year.
[10859.98 → 10860.32] Go more.
[10860.54 → 10860.84] Go more.
[10860.86 → 10861.42] You have to get a raise.
[10863.34 → 10863.50] Jeez.
[10864.12 → 10864.32] Okay,
[10864.34 → 10865.44] let's see if my wife...
[10865.44 → 10866.80] You can have a Goal.
[10866.96 → 10867.52] Can come up with me.
[10867.52 → 10873.12] Oh,
[10873.20 → 10874.26] my soul just left.
[10874.40 → 10875.18] It's in my body.
[10877.10 → 10877.54] Hello?
[10877.90 → 10878.16] Hey,
[10878.22 → 10879.22] you're live on the WAN show.
[10880.16 → 10880.60] Um,
[10880.74 → 10881.80] we had a question.
[10882.50 → 10882.76] Uh,
[10882.80 → 10882.96] oh,
[10883.04 → 10883.22] shoot,
[10883.24 → 10883.96] it's not there anymore.
[10884.08 → 10884.20] But,
[10884.26 → 10884.82] but basically,
[10884.82 → 10886.48] it was along the lines of,
[10886.96 → 10889.52] has there ever been a moment in LMG's history
[10889.52 → 10891.14] when Linus has had a
[10891.64 → 10892.80] I am Linus Sebastian,
[10892.80 → 10895.48] and this is my company moment?
[10895.48 → 10897.66] And I thought you might have a good one.
[10898.84 → 10900.56] You mean besides the time when you told me
[10900.56 → 10902.28] you had to have 51% of the company
[10902.28 → 10903.80] when we started it?
[10905.00 → 10905.36] Oh.
[10905.74 → 10906.02] Okay.
[10906.56 → 10906.84] Yeah,
[10906.84 → 10907.68] that's probably pretty good.
[10907.74 → 10907.92] Thanks,
[10907.98 → 10908.08] hon.
[10909.04 → 10910.06] See you at home.
[10910.20 → 10911.32] Thanks for coming in with the save.
[10911.44 → 10912.08] Appreciate it.
[10912.14 → 10912.68] You win.
[10913.04 → 10913.54] See you later.
[10916.70 → 10917.58] Got him.
[10918.92 → 10919.28] See,
[10919.40 → 10920.20] there's not that many,
[10920.32 → 10921.22] but they happen.
[10921.56 → 10922.68] They definitely happen.
[10922.92 → 10923.72] There's just not that many.
[10923.80 → 10924.76] In my defence,
[10924.76 → 10926.36] it's purely symbolic.
[10927.32 → 10927.72] Sure.
[10928.18 → 10928.72] It's true.
[10928.88 → 10929.32] Sure.
[10929.54 → 10930.22] It's true.
[10930.40 → 10930.72] Sure.
[10931.20 → 10932.46] We have no prenup.
[10932.92 → 10933.14] Sure.
[10933.14 → 10935.14] We are a 50-50 marriage.
[10935.44 → 10935.78] Uh-huh.
[10935.92 → 10936.22] So,
[10936.38 → 10939.20] half of my 51% of the shares belong to her,
[10939.54 → 10942.44] and half of her 49% of the shares belong to me.
[10943.00 → 10943.36] We should,
[10943.36 → 10945.04] we should get into the share conversation.
[10945.94 → 10948.30] And talk about times that Linus said,
[10948.42 → 10948.78] screw you,
[10948.84 → 10949.46] it's my company.
[10951.36 → 10952.56] Or we can go to the next.
[10952.56 → 10952.70] Yeah,
[10952.70 → 10954.78] but you haven't even been able to think of any smart guy.
[10955.04 → 10955.18] Well,
[10955.22 → 10955.72] that's one.
[10956.62 → 10957.06] I mean,
[10958.38 → 10958.66] I,
[10958.84 → 10959.18] okay,
[10959.36 → 10959.46] I,
[10959.46 → 10960.46] I,
[10960.46 → 10960.74] I,
[10960.74 → 10961.16] I don't,
[10961.16 → 10962.78] I don't make unilateral decisions,
[10963.00 → 10963.18] okay?
[10963.20 → 10963.62] We can go to,
[10963.82 → 10964.52] we can go to the next.
[10964.52 → 10964.66] Okay,
[10964.66 → 10966.36] occasionally I make unilateral decisions.
[10966.36 → 10966.84] It's rare.
[10966.84 → 10967.66] I try not to.
[10967.66 → 10968.70] It is genuinely rare.
[10968.96 → 10970.88] I think there's also cases where like,
[10971.66 → 10973.36] if you're leading pretty much anything,
[10973.36 → 10974.82] you're going to have to sometimes,
[10974.92 → 10976.72] even if it's just for like efficiency case,
[10976.80 → 10979.32] because like you can just go around in circles about something forever.
[10979.84 → 10982.96] And eventually someone has to make it stop.
[10982.96 → 10983.10] Okay.
[10983.30 → 10983.56] Yeah.
[10983.58 → 10988.40] Here's one where there was a lot of internal conversation about why we don't cover,
[10988.40 → 10989.02] um,
[10989.02 → 10990.72] paying for alcohol at company events.
[10990.90 → 10992.18] So we'll cover food.
[10992.22 → 10993.26] We'll cover entertainment.
[10993.52 → 10995.84] We don't cover alcohol in some cases.
[10995.96 → 10996.40] Actually,
[10996.42 → 10997.02] there's an exception.
[10997.02 → 10999.12] We do cover two drinks at the Christmas party.
[10999.32 → 10999.84] Uh,
[10999.86 → 11000.74] but aside from the
[11000.84 → 11002.10] aside from the Christmas party,
[11002.10 → 11003.22] just at events,
[11003.64 → 11004.14] um,
[11004.62 → 11005.26] you are,
[11005.40 → 11006.46] as long as it is safe,
[11006.62 → 11009.24] welcome to purchase and consume your own alcohol,
[11009.24 → 11010.30] but we don't pay for it.
[11010.72 → 11011.20] And,
[11011.40 → 11011.84] uh,
[11011.84 → 11014.62] this was a very circular conversation with,
[11014.62 → 11015.22] uh,
[11015.22 → 11019.24] both employees and people in the leadership team where it was like,
[11019.48 → 11019.82] you know,
[11019.82 → 11021.06] we're being prude.
[11021.28 → 11023.30] It's just because you don't drink.
[11023.50 → 11024.22] It's this,
[11024.30 → 11024.66] it's that,
[11024.74 → 11025.00] it's that,
[11025.06 → 11025.28] it's that,
[11025.34 → 11025.54] it's that.
[11025.60 → 11027.12] It went around and around and around and around and around.
[11027.20 → 11027.80] And I basically went,
[11027.88 → 11028.02] look,
[11028.48 → 11029.02] um,
[11029.38 → 11030.52] it's a liability concern.
[11030.80 → 11036.48] The last thing I need is people behaving in ways that are inappropriate on company,
[11036.94 → 11037.84] on company time,
[11037.96 → 11038.82] on company money.
[11039.32 → 11039.76] Um,
[11039.86 → 11040.42] there are,
[11040.58 → 11040.70] there,
[11040.92 → 11047.34] whether you accept it and acknowledge it or not doesn't really matter to me because this has been a problem.
[11047.68 → 11048.08] Um,
[11048.08 → 11050.20] um,
[11050.20 → 11051.20] not just,
[11051.20 → 11051.22] you know,
[11051.22 → 11051.64] uh,
[11052.02 → 11054.22] anecdotally in the news or whatever,
[11054.22 → 11058.32] but even at companies that people here were at previously.
[11058.82 → 11059.14] Um,
[11059.14 → 11061.90] this is an actual real problem, and it simply isn't going to happen.
[11061.90 → 11063.38] And the conversation is now over,
[11063.38 → 11064.08] uh,
[11064.08 → 11064.38] was,
[11064.46 → 11066.70] was pretty much where I came at it from.
[11067.04 → 11067.40] Um,
[11067.40 → 11067.92] and you know,
[11068.00 → 11074.86] part of it is the fact that I feel like I've already given a bulletproof argument and I don't really feel like we need to keep talking about it.
[11075.04 → 11076.96] And the other part of it is that,
[11077.18 → 11077.58] you know,
[11077.62 → 11081.54] the people that I'm discussing this with are coming at it with no skin in the game,
[11081.58 → 11081.74] right?
[11081.74 → 11082.96] Like if there's a
[11083.36 → 11083.58] uh,
[11083.58 → 11085.10] if there is some kind of event,
[11085.14 → 11091.36] even if it's a 1% or a 0.1 or a 0.01% chance of some kind of something bad happening,
[11091.36 → 11092.98] I'm the one who's liable,
[11093.10 → 11093.56] not you.
[11094.10 → 11095.74] So this is my gamble,
[11095.86 → 11096.66] not yours,
[11096.66 → 11098.52] which means I make the call,
[11098.62 → 11099.48] not you.
[11100.52 → 11101.78] And that's one of those examples.
[11101.92 → 11103.04] And that's one of those moments.
[11103.26 → 11103.44] Yeah.
[11103.50 → 11104.40] They're just not common,
[11104.50 → 11105.32] but they're going to happen.
[11105.82 → 11106.18] Um,
[11106.62 → 11107.14] and then,
[11107.34 → 11107.46] right.
[11107.52 → 11108.82] The other part of it was,
[11108.96 → 11109.26] you know,
[11109.86 → 11112.24] I also just don't see why this really matters.
[11112.78 → 11113.46] I'm sorry.
[11113.50 → 11115.70] Your entertainment budget isn't big enough.
[11118.88 → 11121.06] Would you like no entertainment budget?
[11121.48 → 11124.42] Because the last time I checked that ain't in the employee agreement,
[11124.42 → 11126.14] this is not a requirement.
[11126.66 → 11127.64] Um,
[11127.72 → 11128.12] and you know,
[11128.16 → 11128.34] yeah,
[11128.40 → 11128.60] I mean,
[11128.62 → 11131.04] maybe sometimes I do get a little salty about this stuff.
[11131.12 → 11136.12] Like the fact that within two months of us implementing free snacks,
[11136.42 → 11141.92] the fact that it had managed to generate disgruntlement blew my mind.
[11142.22 → 11150.04] We went from having no free snacks to it being political and generating complaints and hurting morale
[11150.04 → 11153.96] in seemingly an unfathomably short period of time.
[11154.58 → 11155.10] And,
[11155.22 → 11155.58] you know,
[11155.58 → 11156.86] my immediate response,
[11157.00 → 11157.34] fortunately,
[11157.34 → 11160.32] I have people around me that helped me be more measured.
[11160.32 → 11165.66] And I also am a pretty experienced business person,
[11165.66 → 11166.60] I guess at this point,
[11166.60 → 11168.74] but my immediate response to something like that is,
[11168.84 → 11168.92] okay,
[11168.92 → 11169.34] no snacks,
[11169.42 → 11170.94] then like no soup for you.
[11170.94 → 11171.18] Like,
[11171.18 → 11174.94] why on earth am I paying money to generate complaints?
[11175.58 → 11175.80] Right?
[11175.80 → 11176.20] Yeah.
[11176.56 → 11177.00] Um,
[11177.00 → 11179.50] we have not done away with snacks.
[11179.58 → 11179.88] In fact,
[11179.88 → 11181.48] we have expanded the snack program,
[11181.48 → 11183.74] but I,
[11184.00 → 11184.70] you know,
[11184.78 → 11184.90] I,
[11184.90 → 11185.20] I do,
[11185.32 → 11185.40] I,
[11185.46 → 11185.58] yeah,
[11185.64 → 11186.18] I'm a person,
[11186.24 → 11186.46] right?
[11186.92 → 11187.28] Um,
[11187.28 → 11187.78] and this is,
[11187.78 → 11188.04] I mean,
[11188.04 → 11189.38] this comes down to that same,
[11189.52 → 11191.74] that conversation that comes up time and again about,
[11191.74 → 11192.28] um,
[11192.36 → 11193.96] whether LMG should unionize,
[11194.00 → 11194.22] right?
[11194.74 → 11195.94] Like from my point of view,
[11196.02 → 11196.12] well,
[11196.12 → 11198.88] that's the decision that needs to be made by the LMG staff.
[11199.10 → 11199.50] It's,
[11199.50 → 11201.20] there's nothing I could do to prevent it,
[11201.20 → 11202.86] but me as a person,
[11202.86 → 11203.48] as a
[11203.48 → 11204.82] an emotional being,
[11204.82 → 11205.52] you know,
[11205.54 → 11208.60] I would feel like I failed, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that
[11208.60 → 11210.46] because we do actually try.
[11210.56 → 11214.68] We do actually try to make this a great place to work, and we try to make it
[11214.68 → 11218.64] the kind of place to work that you wouldn't need protection from us.
[11218.98 → 11219.38] Um,
[11219.38 → 11221.44] and we would want you to not feel like you do.
[11221.52 → 11221.70] I mean,
[11221.70 → 11222.20] if you did,
[11222.20 → 11223.70] then ultimately that's,
[11223.76 → 11224.82] that's your choice,
[11224.86 → 11225.10] right?
[11225.72 → 11226.12] Um,
[11226.88 → 11229.48] but I would like to believe that as long as you're going to be,
[11229.48 → 11232.66] as long as we continue to put in our best effort that you won't feel
[11232.66 → 11233.46] that's necessary.
[11234.28 → 11235.16] But like I said,
[11235.20 → 11237.22] there's nothing I could do to prevent it legally.
[11240.76 → 11241.24] Okay.
[11241.60 → 11243.02] Last curated merch message.
[11244.94 → 11246.78] I know this is a big question,
[11246.90 → 11250.46] but assuming AI and robotics continue to advance at the rate it has been,
[11250.46 → 11255.20] would you ever be comfortable with an AI or an AI robot taking care of your
[11255.20 → 11256.88] children or the elderly?
[11257.48 → 11258.20] Children know elderly,
[11258.20 → 11260.66] anything that gets them off my case.
[11261.36 → 11262.80] There's a movie about that.
[11262.88 → 11263.24] Is that,
[11263.38 → 11264.96] is that the quiet part out loud again?
[11269.16 → 11270.28] There's a movie about that.
[11270.34 → 11270.46] Yeah.
[11270.50 → 11271.76] It's robot and Frank.
[11272.86 → 11273.62] Phenomenal film.
[11274.12 → 11274.52] Uh,
[11274.58 → 11275.36] old guy,
[11275.62 → 11281.04] his son pawns them off with this like robot caretaker, and he teaches it to do
[11281.04 → 11281.66] crimes.
[11283.16 → 11283.56] Nice.
[11283.56 → 11284.64] It sounds hilarious.
[11284.64 → 11285.28] It's phenomenal.
[11285.46 → 11285.88] It's really,
[11286.08 → 11286.44] perfect.
[11286.72 → 11286.86] Cool.
[11287.18 → 11287.58] Um,
[11287.58 → 11289.92] and now we're back into potential.
[11291.18 → 11293.34] I'm still trying to chew away at these.
[11293.52 → 11294.14] Do you want to,
[11294.22 → 11294.70] I mean,
[11294.70 → 11297.60] you can start reading them, or you're welcome to respond via text.
[11297.76 → 11298.34] I think I can,
[11298.44 → 11298.90] you guys can read.
[11298.90 → 11299.84] Are you still going bottom up?
[11300.28 → 11300.54] Yep.
[11300.98 → 11304.08] So I'm going to jump more into the middle and I think you maybe read from the
[11304.08 → 11304.32] top.
[11304.72 → 11304.96] Sure.
[11305.12 → 11306.14] And we try to parallelize.
[11306.24 → 11306.84] Let's go.
[11307.24 → 11307.78] Sounds good.
[11308.24 → 11310.16] Hi Linus on Sancho a month or so back.
[11310.22 → 11314.04] You talked about carrying your Ludwig bidet on the LTT store.
[11314.14 → 11315.40] Are you still working on that?
[11315.54 → 11315.82] Oh yeah.
[11316.18 → 11317.26] How are you liking yours?
[11317.86 → 11318.20] It's good.
[11318.20 → 11320.92] I wish I had one on every toilet.
[11321.14 → 11321.56] I don't.
[11321.70 → 11324.78] So I can't claim that my butt is particularly clean right now,
[11324.86 → 11326.00] but sometimes it's clean.
[11331.14 → 11332.80] Who do I file complaints to?
[11334.34 → 11335.02] Hey DLL.
[11335.02 → 11335.68] You're a union rep.
[11336.66 → 11337.70] We have HR now.
[11337.88 → 11338.02] Yeah,
[11338.08 → 11338.30] we do.
[11338.76 → 11339.48] Hey DLL,
[11339.66 → 11340.36] I can't find.
[11340.36 → 11343.96] HR isn't on a particular side as far as I can tell.
[11344.78 → 11348.18] HR exists to keep both sides from yelling at each other.
[11349.06 → 11350.18] It's a good thing.
[11350.38 → 11350.54] Yeah.
[11351.16 → 11351.54] Hey DLL,
[11351.74 → 11357.38] I can't find record of Linus talking about ZDTV or tech TV ever before.
[11357.56 → 11359.62] Did you watch it as a youth like myself?
[11359.74 → 11360.38] I didn't have cable.
[11361.14 → 11361.80] So no.
[11361.98 → 11362.44] Me neither.
[11362.80 → 11363.50] So also no.
[11363.64 → 11367.60] I became aware of tech TV when I met Chris Peril lo basically.
[11368.26 → 11369.96] I only knew him as Locker Gnome.
[11370.24 → 11372.16] I didn't even know that he had a career in media.
[11373.56 → 11375.78] I probably did before I met him,
[11375.92 → 11376.20] met him,
[11376.20 → 11377.96] but I didn't know as I was,
[11378.02 → 11382.48] as I was chasing him in YouTube subscriber count in my early years.
[11383.34 → 11387.70] You introduced me to both of those because I had no idea because I also didn't have cable.
[11389.06 → 11391.84] I've always wondered other than GPU block and CPU block,
[11391.98 → 11398.46] why standard plumbing fittings from the hardware store are not used as water cooling components in a computer?
[11398.46 → 11400.78] Is it a compatibility problem?
[11401.10 → 11401.34] Yes.
[11401.68 → 11402.74] For the most part,
[11402.84 → 11408.96] they use completely different thread standards than what you would use in a water cooling system in a computer.
[11409.48 → 11410.68] And for good reason.
[11410.82 → 11413.22] They often have much longer threads.
[11413.22 → 11415.90] They're designed to operate for 50,
[11416.10 → 11418.04] a hundred years uninterrupted.
[11418.38 → 11418.76] So,
[11418.94 → 11419.20] you know,
[11419.24 → 11424.02] you'll have threads that are this long and meant to be wrapped with Teflon tape and like threaded in with a wrench.
[11424.10 → 11427.12] Like it's not practical to work on a computer like that.
[11427.26 → 11429.86] You'd have to have blocks that stuck this far off your motherboard.
[11430.04 → 11430.22] Right.
[11430.22 → 11432.32] So they're just,
[11432.32 → 11436.36] nothing would prevent you from using them if you had compatible blocks,
[11436.46 → 11440.04] but blocks aren't designed to use them because it kind of sucked.
[11440.16 → 11441.60] That's how a lot of things used to work.
[11442.06 → 11443.08] Like thermophile fitting,
[11443.30 → 11444.78] thermophile radiators,
[11444.88 → 11445.32] for example,
[11445.40 → 11448.36] used to use BSPP 3.8s or something like that.
[11448.40 → 11448.62] I don't know.
[11448.66 → 11452.28] There were these enormous-threaded fittings, and they were lower restriction,
[11452.48 → 11453.52] but it wasn't necessary.
[11453.80 → 11459.20] So moving to industry standard G1 quarter was the ultimate good play.
[11460.22 → 11463.58] Any plans for other styles of the wag hoodie?
[11463.74 → 11465.68] I'd love to match my short circuit one.
[11465.88 → 11467.18] Also cat beds when?
[11470.26 → 11472.56] Cat beds actually coming sooner than you think.
[11472.74 → 11476.54] We are in our second stage of sampling.
[11477.28 → 11478.36] Do you know about this?
[11478.94 → 11479.22] What?
[11479.32 → 11479.44] Sorry.
[11479.66 → 11480.18] The cat beds.
[11480.74 → 11481.36] Oh yes.
[11481.36 → 11481.72] Yeah.
[11481.90 → 11482.52] So it's a
[11482.58 → 11486.30] it's a PC tower with the side panel off and the side panel is a little bed.
[11486.42 → 11489.72] And then we also have a CRT monitor that the cat can go inside.
[11489.72 → 11490.70] Oh my God.
[11491.14 → 11491.30] Yeah,
[11491.40 → 11491.78] I know.
[11491.84 → 11492.04] Right.
[11493.08 → 11496.12] There's definitely been some communication challenges with the supplier,
[11496.24 → 11497.72] but we are still working on it.
[11500.72 → 11501.12] Hi,
[11501.18 → 11501.76] Linus and Luke.
[11501.88 → 11502.94] Long time fan of the show.
[11503.16 → 11505.10] We are expecting our first child in June.
[11505.58 → 11505.98] Question.
[11506.20 → 11506.90] Thinking of your kids,
[11507.04 → 11509.36] what future tech are you most excited for,
[11509.44 → 11512.24] or most worried about for them to be using?
[11512.52 → 11512.74] Cheers.
[11512.98 → 11513.16] AI.
[11513.16 → 11513.24] Bye.
[11516.54 → 11517.84] Howdy from the Rocky Mountains.
[11518.00 → 11523.24] My wife and I are picking up the book and sorter for a family announcement.
[11523.72 → 11526.78] What advice would you give to people who are going to be first time parents?
[11527.72 → 11528.92] Don't say AI again.
[11529.82 → 11530.18] Um,
[11530.72 → 11532.68] have fun,
[11532.78 → 11533.16] enjoy it.
[11533.16 → 11536.18] I know that's such a stereotypical answer,
[11536.18 → 11537.08] but like,
[11537.88 → 11538.26] man,
[11538.74 → 11542.76] I can barely pick up my eldest anymore.
[11543.30 → 11543.42] And,
[11543.54 → 11543.68] you know,
[11543.76 → 11546.74] you kind of someday I won't be able to do it anymore.
[11547.06 → 11549.94] And you're going to wish you could do it one more time.
[11550.02 → 11550.26] You know,
[11550.26 → 11552.66] oof.
[11553.72 → 11555.08] Catching the feels on Sancho.
[11555.22 → 11555.62] Yeah.
[11555.96 → 11556.44] It's okay.
[11557.84 → 11558.22] It's okay.
[11559.44 → 11560.56] Linus is going to the gym with me.
[11560.86 → 11562.76] We'll make it so you can lift.
[11563.20 → 11563.50] Yeah,
[11563.56 → 11564.86] but he's coming to the gym too.
[11565.00 → 11566.04] He's going to get huge.
[11566.44 → 11566.80] Worked.
[11569.72 → 11570.34] Hey guys,
[11570.40 → 11570.88] love the show.
[11571.36 → 11571.66] Linus,
[11571.68 → 11573.32] have you played around with Envy anymore?
[11573.32 → 11575.36] What are your thoughts on how it compares to Plex?
[11575.72 → 11576.34] I haven't.
[11576.52 → 11580.08] I've been lazy in spite of the fact that there are still some things broken in
[11580.08 → 11580.36] Plex,
[11580.50 → 11582.52] like just playing the next,
[11583.38 → 11584.66] the next show,
[11584.86 → 11585.44] for example,
[11585.68 → 11587.06] is like maybe a 50,
[11587.14 → 11588.72] 50 shot for me on the Android app.
[11588.78 → 11589.56] It's really frustrating,
[11589.78 → 11590.56] but I'm just,
[11590.64 → 11591.34] I'm lazy.
[11592.76 → 11593.86] Do you think it's okay for people,
[11594.20 → 11596.70] users in an office to be computer-literate?
[11597.16 → 11601.08] What baseline of computer ability do you think people should have nowadays?
[11601.28 → 11601.82] The question is,
[11601.90 → 11603.40] is it okay for them to be illiterate?
[11603.74 → 11604.02] No.
[11604.58 → 11610.06] I think that computer literacy is basically a necessity for,
[11610.08 → 11611.44] functioning in the modern world.
[11611.44 → 11613.48] And if your computer illiterate,
[11613.64 → 11616.80] it reveals to me that you are an
[11616.80 → 11616.98] an
[11616.98 → 11617.08] an
[11617.08 → 11618.08] an uncurious,
[11618.08 → 11619.02] um,
[11619.70 → 11620.06] person.
[11620.16 → 11620.28] Ooh,
[11620.28 → 11621.02] that's a bad one.
[11621.38 → 11621.94] Yeah,
[11621.98 → 11629.18] because the internet and technology is your gateway to learning.
[11629.18 → 11629.52] Right.
[11629.52 → 11633.18] And so if you haven't figured out what an efficient learning tool it is,
[11633.18 → 11636.38] then you either haven't looked that hard or you just don't care,
[11636.90 → 11641.28] which to me means you probably are uncurious,
[11641.88 → 11644.00] an uncurious person.
[11645.08 → 11648.36] Linus and Luke working in and around your industries.
[11648.36 → 11650.68] And for all the knowledge you have,
[11651.20 → 11653.34] no one sees the future.
[11653.86 → 11654.94] What sort of,
[11655.22 → 11658.54] what's some tech you are completely surprised by that came into being?
[11658.54 → 11659.18] Well,
[11659.28 → 11663.40] I am on the record on WAN show saying crypto would never be used for
[11663.40 → 11663.84] anything.
[11666.28 → 11667.60] Like real transactions,
[11667.78 → 11668.92] not be used for anything.
[11668.92 → 11671.22] I said it wouldn't be used for any real transactions.
[11671.74 → 11672.02] Uh,
[11672.02 → 11674.80] when someone made news for buying a house with it or something like that,
[11674.82 → 11675.10] I was like,
[11675.12 → 11675.24] well,
[11675.24 → 11675.80] that's a one-off.
[11675.90 → 11676.02] That'll,
[11676.44 → 11678.02] so that worked out great for me.
[11678.30 → 11678.54] Yeah.
[11678.54 → 11679.50] Um,
[11680.72 → 11685.76] I thought VR was closer and AI was further.
[11686.54 → 11686.98] Yeah.
[11687.28 → 11689.78] We still haven't hit that date that I said for VR,
[11689.96 → 11691.34] but I don't think it's looking good.
[11691.46 → 11691.88] I don't know.
[11692.14 → 11692.62] Apple's,
[11692.62 → 11693.06] uh,
[11693.16 → 11694.16] Apple's upcoming headset.
[11694.28 → 11696.34] They might launch and save my prediction.
[11696.48 → 11696.70] Yeah.
[11696.70 → 11698.46] Some insiders or who,
[11698.52 → 11699.84] or who have tested it or like,
[11699.90 → 11701.68] it blew me away or something.
[11701.90 → 11702.20] Okay.
[11702.28 → 11703.82] No way to tell if they're telling the truth though.
[11703.82 → 11704.16] Well,
[11704.22 → 11704.60] hopefully.
[11705.00 → 11705.40] Um,
[11705.84 → 11706.60] but yeah.
[11707.18 → 11707.40] Yeah.
[11709.24 → 11709.72] Excited.
[11709.82 → 11712.20] The wad wag hoodie is finally here.
[11712.58 → 11712.80] Linus,
[11712.84 → 11716.12] do you think you'll try the pixel fold when it comes out or just stick with the
[11716.12 → 11716.88] galaxy fold?
[11717.36 → 11721.26] I will 100% try a hypothetical pixel fold when it comes out.
[11721.44 → 11721.68] Um,
[11722.16 → 11725.04] there are some definite frustrations with the galaxy fold.
[11725.12 → 11731.92] I'll be very curious to see if YouTube or if Google on their own device
[11731.92 → 11733.44] manages to fix some of the problems.
[11733.44 → 11735.54] I still have with the YouTube app on this one.
[11736.62 → 11738.84] If they don't rest assured,
[11738.92 → 11740.46] I will tear them a new one over it.
[11741.70 → 11742.14] Luke,
[11742.22 → 11743.38] I know you don't like,
[11743.48 → 11744.98] and don't shop on Amazon,
[11744.98 → 11748.10] but with items being cheaper on Amazon than stores,
[11748.10 → 11749.84] it's easier to just buy on Amazon,
[11749.98 → 11751.10] especially when money's tight.
[11751.24 → 11752.02] What do you think?
[11752.60 → 11752.78] Yeah,
[11752.80 → 11753.16] it's tough.
[11753.50 → 11753.80] I,
[11753.96 → 11756.96] I don't for the reasons that I have.
[11757.20 → 11757.56] Um,
[11757.56 → 11760.20] but I don't expect that others necessarily do the same.
[11760.78 → 11761.16] Um,
[11761.18 → 11761.72] I also,
[11761.72 → 11763.42] I'm very cheap in a lot of ways.
[11763.44 → 11765.28] And then also I make good money.
[11765.28 → 11767.58] So it's not generally a problem for me.
[11768.20 → 11768.68] Um,
[11769.48 → 11773.38] so I will go out of my way and often end up spending more to get it from mom
[11773.38 → 11775.54] and pop shops and brick and mortars whenever I can.
[11776.14 → 11776.62] Um,
[11777.14 → 11779.14] or find alternatives when I can't,
[11779.28 → 11782.70] but I am not about to sit here and preach at people,
[11782.70 → 11783.64] um,
[11783.64 → 11787.78] telling them to spend extra money on things that they've maybe can't afford,
[11787.78 → 11788.68] um,
[11788.68 → 11790.24] when they're just doing what they can to get by.
[11790.24 → 11790.64] Um,
[11790.64 → 11791.98] so do what you're going to do.
[11792.32 → 11792.66] Um,
[11793.08 → 11793.28] yeah,
[11793.46 → 11794.02] that's about it.
[11795.10 → 11796.82] Any updates on Linus's smart home,
[11797.02 → 11798.72] still using and enjoying home assistant.
[11799.10 → 11802.34] I've been using it for years and open source software for the win.
[11804.78 → 11805.30] Um,
[11806.18 → 11807.02] yep.
[11807.08 → 11808.10] Still using home assistant,
[11808.52 → 11809.68] still happy with it.
[11809.68 → 11812.70] Other than those switches that I'm still having trouble with,
[11812.70 → 11814.46] with the Z-Wave JS or whatever,
[11814.70 → 11818.58] I'm hopefully going to switch over to those upcoming in a Valley ones,
[11818.74 → 11819.56] project Linus.
[11819.64 → 11819.74] Oh,
[11819.88 → 11820.02] Hey,
[11820.02 → 11820.42] how'd their,
[11820.50 → 11820.86] um,
[11821.00 → 11821.62] how'd their Indie go,
[11821.66 → 11821.76] go,
[11821.76 → 11821.96] go,
[11821.96 → 11823.96] uh,
[11824.62 → 11825.58] in a Valley.
[11825.58 → 11826.98] I haven't looked at it recently.
[11829.44 → 11829.88] Hmm.
[11830.88 → 11831.36] Okay.
[11832.98 → 11833.26] Yeah.
[11833.26 → 11834.40] Adding keyword Indie go,
[11834.48 → 11834.54] go.
[11834.60 → 11837.78] I swear like Google search has gotten a lot worse.
[11840.06 → 11840.50] Wow.
[11840.96 → 11844.22] They raised 222,000 us dollars.
[11844.34 → 11845.28] They have nine days left.
[11845.34 → 11845.58] Okay.
[11845.60 → 11846.76] Well that is funded.
[11846.96 → 11847.76] So yeah,
[11847.76 → 11849.46] hopefully I'll get switches at some point.
[11849.52 → 11850.02] That'll be cool.
[11852.50 → 11853.68] Where are we in potential?
[11853.86 → 11854.42] There we are.
[11854.92 → 11855.06] Oh,
[11855.06 → 11856.26] um,
[11856.36 → 11856.62] Linus,
[11856.66 → 11859.14] any updates on LTT and SPL new?
[11860.18 → 11860.62] Yes.
[11860.92 → 11861.44] Uh,
[11861.44 → 11862.08] right now,
[11862.08 → 11866.98] I think it's like 10 days behind or something like that because there's,
[11867.08 → 11867.96] uh,
[11868.32 → 11872.72] there's like gating that's going on with the like AI service that we're using to
[11872.72 → 11873.12] translate.
[11873.84 → 11874.24] Um,
[11874.24 → 11874.76] that's unfortunate.
[11874.86 → 11874.94] Yeah.
[11874.98 → 11875.14] Well,
[11875.14 → 11878.44] the workaround is that we just use multiple accounts, and they're apparently
[11878.44 → 11879.62] okay with it or something.
[11879.80 → 11880.24] Yeah.
[11880.28 → 11880.44] No,
[11880.44 → 11880.58] no,
[11880.64 → 11880.76] no.
[11880.86 → 11882.56] Ed's working through it with them.
[11882.56 → 11883.00] Okay.
[11883.00 → 11887.62] The goal for him this quarter is to get it to within two days of release.
[11887.78 → 11888.12] Cool.
[11888.20 → 11888.62] For LTT.
[11888.92 → 11889.12] Yeah.
[11889.60 → 11889.86] Yeah.
[11890.66 → 11891.02] Hey,
[11891.08 → 11891.52] LLD,
[11891.78 → 11895.94] what is currently a piece of tech that you are really impressed with right now?
[11896.04 → 11896.80] Besides AI?
[11896.80 → 11898.24] Well,
[11898.36 → 11899.70] PlayStation five is kind of killing it.
[11900.32 → 11901.36] PSVR too.
[11901.64 → 11902.42] It's like kind of awesome.
[11902.42 → 11906.22] I think the mobile gaming devices just as a pool.
[11906.98 → 11907.02] Hmm.
[11907.26 → 11907.92] Steam deck,
[11908.16 → 11909.22] the new one,
[11909.74 → 11910.42] whatever it's called.
[11910.74 → 11910.92] Uh,
[11910.98 → 11911.30] ally,
[11911.54 → 11911.88] ally,
[11912.06 → 11912.44] that one,
[11912.84 → 11913.66] those things.
[11914.20 → 11914.90] They're cool.
[11915.54 → 11917.90] I love the allay is to wait.
[11918.92 → 11919.42] Oh,
[11919.44 → 11920.04] let me get the bell.
[11921.44 → 11921.94] No,
[11921.98 → 11922.86] it's not fun now.
[11924.28 → 11925.40] Will it be worthy?
[11925.40 → 11927.88] He's not going to do it.
[11929.22 → 11929.66] Okay.
[11930.02 → 11930.38] Uh,
[11930.38 → 11931.22] I love these new stickers.
[11931.46 → 11934.96] I was wondering if you had plans to do a bird option.
[11935.38 → 11936.50] We have two con,
[11936.66 → 11937.26] conjures.
[11937.84 → 11939.08] A lie is cool.
[11939.24 → 11940.32] And that's the truth.
[11942.60 → 11943.66] It's actually pretty good.
[11944.18 → 11947.06] You waited long enough that no one was expecting it.
[11947.08 → 11948.12] And it became good again.
[11948.24 → 11948.84] That was very,
[11948.92 → 11950.22] that was very tactical of you.
[11950.70 → 11951.14] Um,
[11951.14 → 11951.96] he's getting advanced.
[11951.96 → 11952.46] I'm not going to lie.
[11952.52 → 11953.34] When I saw the
[11953.34 → 11954.86] the cat and dog stickers today,
[11954.86 → 11955.20] I was like,
[11955.22 → 11956.44] a bird would be pretty cool,
[11956.58 → 11958.16] but I don't think I'm not anywhere.
[11958.16 → 11961.84] Even remotely close to as many people have birds than people.
[11961.90 → 11963.46] I think you're the only one.
[11964.54 → 11964.86] I,
[11964.94 → 11966.56] no one else here that I'm aware of has birds.
[11966.72 → 11966.92] Yeah.
[11966.92 → 11971.10] And I think the cats and dog stickers are like the company's cats and dogs,
[11971.18 → 11971.34] right?
[11971.56 → 11974.24] So unless you want a sticker pack of two birds,
[11974.36 → 11975.38] just mine.
[11977.12 → 11977.58] You know what?
[11978.26 → 11978.90] You know what?
[11979.96 → 11980.90] We'll do a pen.
[11981.56 → 11981.84] Oh,
[11981.86 → 11982.38] that's cool.
[11982.68 → 11982.88] Oh,
[11982.92 → 11983.64] that's pretty cool.
[11983.76 → 11984.38] That is cool.
[11987.68 → 11989.62] Wait for him to send his text message.
[11989.64 → 11989.78] No,
[11989.84 → 11989.96] no,
[11990.04 → 11990.28] hit me.
[11990.28 → 11990.62] Sweet.
[11990.62 → 11991.28] Linus.
[11991.40 → 11999.08] I produce my company's YouTube channel working alongside with my SME who has ADHD and is our brand ambassador.
[11999.28 → 11999.58] All right.
[12000.50 → 12005.42] What kinds of methods have you employed to ensure your personality shines through the script?
[12005.98 → 12008.54] The easiest way is to edit all the scripts myself,
[12008.70 → 12011.92] which is not particularly efficient,
[12012.34 → 12015.18] but I haven't found a better way yet.
[12016.94 → 12018.46] So cool.
[12019.06 → 12019.50] Yeah.
[12019.50 → 12019.62] Yeah.
[12023.62 → 12024.06] Sweet.
[12024.94 → 12028.46] Have you ever considered incorporating magnets into garments?
[12028.46 → 12033.40] Would love a magnetically detachable hoodie on lttstore.com.
[12033.84 → 12035.96] We do have magnets in some of our garments.
[12036.24 → 12040.80] Our shorts have magnets and magnetic flaps on the like side pockets.
[12041.62 → 12045.26] I'm trying to think if there's anywhere else that we use magnets.
[12045.44 → 12045.70] Probably.
[12046.24 → 12047.66] I can't remember off the top of my head,
[12047.66 → 12053.02] but I will tell you that a magnetically attaching hoodie would not be a great idea.
[12053.02 → 12055.64] And the reasons for that are a couple fold.
[12055.64 → 12059.36] So one is that in order for them to be strong enough,
[12059.46 → 12060.80] they would have to be quite large,
[12060.80 → 12065.44] which adds cost and complexity in construction and also increases weight.
[12065.58 → 12068.68] And having that around a hood could be quite challenging.
[12068.68 → 12073.64] Also, there'd be no way to make sure that it really attaches permanently when you're grabbing on it.
[12073.64 → 12076.06] Garments get manhandled a lot.
[12076.16 → 12077.14] It's sort of inherent.
[12077.36 → 12079.56] And the third reason is that they can be damaged by heat.
[12079.80 → 12081.28] So anything that would go in the dryer,
[12081.92 → 12089.82] you could risk the magnets losing some of their magnetic strength over time.
[12089.82 → 12095.06] And something like a hoodie becomes non-functional if the magnetic strength falls too much.
[12095.30 → 12098.36] Something like a pocket that's already kind of being held down by gravity,
[12098.36 → 12100.52] but the magnet just keeps it clicked into place,
[12100.52 → 12111.86] is less likely to suffer like a functionality deficiency due to the loss of magnetic strength.
[12111.86 → 12114.82] So something that we have to use strategically.
[12115.76 → 12117.06] I love magnets though.
[12117.96 → 12118.42] Pretty cool.
[12119.22 → 12120.56] We've got some curated here.
[12120.64 → 12121.36] I think you guys did.
[12121.82 → 12122.20] Hi, Dan.
[12122.28 → 12123.88] And I guess Linus and Luke.
[12124.12 → 12124.60] Two questions.
[12124.68 → 12126.88] Do you think you'll ever do a collab with Nitwit again?
[12127.04 → 12129.00] And whatever happened to Brian, the electrician?
[12129.48 → 12130.24] Brian moved.
[12130.50 → 12135.98] And I think we were potentially discussing doing a collab with Kyle, like upcoming.
[12136.66 → 12139.46] I haven't worked with him in forever just because of travel and stuff.
[12139.46 → 12140.66] But yeah, don't worry.
[12140.74 → 12141.70] We're still friends.
[12142.72 → 12143.40] Hi, Linus and Luke.
[12143.68 → 12147.74] Watched everything since the parking lot days before WAN existed.
[12148.38 → 12152.24] Any plans to implement feedback from the Working for LMG videos?
[12152.58 → 12154.90] P.S. Luke's mom on WAN show again when?
[12156.96 → 12159.30] Feedback from the Working video.
[12159.48 → 12160.40] Linus can't watch it.
[12160.60 → 12164.06] So I believe the rest of us can.
[12165.16 → 12168.84] So there's what I can say is there's already been some effort.
[12169.60 → 12173.40] But like a lot of the things that we're complaining about were already known issues, which is good.
[12173.72 → 12182.14] Yeah, because we did a round of one-on-one interviews with HR and literally everyone before we did that video.
[12182.14 → 12185.46] So I'm not watching the video because I said I wouldn't.
[12185.72 → 12188.12] But I wouldn't expect there to be any surprises there.
[12188.18 → 12189.16] There wouldn't be any surprises.
[12189.38 → 12189.66] So.
[12190.00 → 12190.16] Yeah.
[12190.16 → 12196.34] And like there are things that even before the one-on-ones, a lot of them we already knew and were working on.
[12197.40 → 12201.42] A lot of them are related to just being an extremely high-velocity workplace.
[12201.42 → 12204.76] And there are things being done to work on that.
[12204.82 → 12205.10] I don't know.
[12205.22 → 12205.32] Yeah.
[12205.42 → 12206.68] All the other managers can watch it.
[12206.72 → 12207.48] It's just he can't watch it.
[12207.66 → 12207.96] You don't.
[12208.54 → 12214.14] Joseph asks, when are we going to get a Linus and Luke review sexualized LTT fan art video?
[12214.50 → 12215.36] Float plane exclusive.
[12215.86 → 12216.18] What?
[12216.34 → 12217.50] I already typed the response.
[12217.62 → 12218.64] We are never doing that.
[12221.48 → 12223.78] The last thing we need is to egg you people on.
[12223.98 → 12224.96] There is a lot of it, though.
[12227.14 → 12227.80] What's going on?
[12227.82 → 12228.66] I thought we were almost out.
[12228.66 → 12230.22] Oh, it's incoming.
[12230.38 → 12231.04] They don't stop coming.
[12232.14 → 12234.42] Yeah, I think, Linus, if you start at the top of incoming.
[12236.28 → 12239.12] Thanks for making my Friday and Saturday so much better.
[12239.54 → 12244.98] LL&D, what's a life lesson you could learn from an aging piece of technology?
[12245.18 → 12247.74] Tape drive, record player, cassette, disc.
[12248.10 → 12249.24] What speaks to you?
[12250.86 → 12253.12] I still love hard drives.
[12254.26 → 12254.54] Yeah.
[12254.54 → 12261.78] I love the marriage of digital and mechanical innovation.
[12261.78 → 12262.78] hard drives.
[12262.78 → 12263.78] I love the hard drive.
[12263.78 → 12264.78] I love the hard drive.
[12264.78 → 12265.34] I love the hard drive.
[12265.34 → 12265.62] I love the hard drive.
[12265.62 → 12265.90] I love the hard drive.
[12265.90 → 12266.16] I love the hard drive.
[12266.16 → 12267.04] What's the quote?
[12267.16 → 12270.78] Something, something sufficiently advanced technology is indiscernible from magic.
[12271.28 → 12274.52] Hard drives are indiscernible from magic to me.
[12274.52 → 12276.48] And I don't mean that literally.
[12276.62 → 12277.54] I understand how they work.
[12277.54 → 12282.94] Even if you deeply understand how they work, it's still just like, what?
[12282.94 → 12286.08] There's hurricane force winds inside a hard drive.
[12286.80 → 12290.72] And yet it still manages to operate at nanoscale.
[12290.90 → 12290.92] Yeah.
[12291.30 → 12297.72] Like, I forget how a WD rep described it to us once, but it was like a bird flying three
[12297.72 → 12304.60] inches over the ground in a hurricane or something like that, and managing to perform this task.
[12304.78 → 12307.72] Like, it's mind-blowing to me.
[12307.80 → 12308.26] Hard drives.
[12308.26 → 12309.16] I love hard drives.
[12309.16 → 12309.78] Hard drives are cool.
[12310.58 → 12312.68] I like, uh, game cartridges.
[12315.72 → 12317.92] I also, okay, here's a controversial take.
[12318.06 → 12323.20] I like hard drives because I miss the thinking sounds computers make.
[12323.84 → 12324.48] I don't miss that.
[12324.96 → 12325.44] Not even a little.
[12325.64 → 12326.80] I know, but I do.
[12327.24 → 12331.78] If you watch an old movie, and like, they have to do something on the computer, and you hear
[12331.78 → 12334.72] it is like, I'm like, that is so sick.
[12335.24 → 12335.82] So cool.
[12336.14 → 12338.20] Floppy drives seeking noises, that sort of thing.
[12338.32 → 12338.50] Yeah.
[12338.68 → 12339.28] Oh, it's great.
[12339.38 → 12340.02] Yeah, it's sweet.
[12340.46 → 12347.04] But like, electric cars putting speakers in their engine bays to make the sound of ice
[12347.04 → 12348.04] cars is stupid.
[12348.22 → 12351.56] And I don't want my computer to like, have a speaker that makes it sound like it's working.
[12351.62 → 12352.30] That's stupid.
[12352.76 → 12355.66] I just want it to like, actually, if it's actually a thing, that's cool.
[12355.90 → 12356.28] That's it.
[12356.50 → 12360.66] M.2 SSD that has a speaker that plays hard drive noises.
[12360.66 → 12362.20] I hate it.
[12362.28 → 12363.38] Come on, AliExpress.
[12363.46 → 12363.86] Let's go.
[12365.02 → 12366.34] Okay, a couple more curated here.
[12366.74 → 12371.72] Hey, Linus, for transparency's sake, why don't you guys talk about bill of materials, bill
[12371.72 → 12374.56] of services, and how much you make on a product?
[12375.08 → 12375.96] Your margins.
[12376.46 → 12379.50] Maybe start with today's launch, the WAG hoodie.
[12380.44 → 12382.12] Other than that, they're none of your business.
[12382.12 → 12382.90] I don't really know.
[12387.90 → 12388.54] Yeah.
[12388.98 → 12396.88] If we were a public company, we would disclose that because our shareholders have a vested
[12396.88 → 12397.42] interest.
[12397.42 → 12408.60] But if we decide to strategically take lower margin on one product and make it up somewhere
[12408.60 → 12412.98] else, I just don't really feel like I owe anybody an explanation for that.
[12413.58 → 12420.12] You know, for us, it's more about making sure that the quality of the product justifies the
[12420.12 → 12430.42] end retail price, you know, compared to other competing products out there.
[12430.80 → 12435.20] And I just don't really think, I don't really think it matters.
[12437.18 → 12442.08] Yeah, the people are talking in chat, like even in private companies, or even in public
[12442.08 → 12446.94] companies, margins are expressed more generally, or sometimes business unit by business unit,
[12446.94 → 12450.68] but generally not all the way down to an individual product.
[12450.78 → 12456.60] A lot of companies consider that to be just highly confidential, like trade secret information
[12456.60 → 12459.14] even, like how many margins they're able to make.
[12459.26 → 12466.64] Because say AMD knew how much margin NVIDIA was making on an RTX 4090, they could take that
[12466.64 → 12473.50] information and turn it around into a competitive advantage against NVIDIA by squeezing TSMC or
[12473.50 → 12476.44] board partners or whatever else the case may be.
[12476.94 → 12482.04] So I can see why AMD would want to know, but I don't see why there would be any benefit
[12482.04 → 12483.44] to NVIDIA to disclose that.
[12487.04 → 12488.30] Okay, next up.
[12488.86 → 12493.56] Linus, how has your neurodivergents hindered you on the path to getting to the successful
[12493.56 → 12494.56] place you are today?
[12494.90 → 12496.92] What strategies do you use to overcome it?
[12497.30 → 12501.98] Or has it had the or has it possibly helped in certain scenarios?
[12501.98 → 12503.38] I don't really think of...
[12503.38 → 12508.00] What are we divergent from if we are all divergent?
[12508.04 → 12515.96] Yeah, I'm about to get spicy here because I don't necessarily consider ADHD to be neurodivergent
[12515.96 → 12516.62] in that sense.
[12516.70 → 12519.66] I don't really consider it to be a major disadvantage.
[12519.66 → 12525.66] I think everybody's a little bit different, and we can try and group people into buckets and
[12525.66 → 12533.94] sort them by colour or by the method that they best approach a problem or whatever else it
[12533.94 → 12534.12] is.
[12534.18 → 12538.76] But at the end of the day, all we get is the hand we're dealt, and we got to make it work.
[12538.88 → 12544.34] And there's definitely been times that not being able to focus on stuff has been challenging.
[12544.34 → 12545.38] I mean, I flunked out of school.
[12545.54 → 12549.04] That's a pretty bad mark.
[12549.34 → 12550.22] The beginning of the hack?
[12551.34 → 12553.72] Yeah, I mean, I was pretty useless there, right?
[12553.90 → 12558.42] There's definitely times that it's challenging, but the best thing that you can do, I think,
[12558.46 → 12560.36] is surround yourself with people that make you better.
[12561.04 → 12564.02] Surround yourself with people who fill those holes, right?
[12564.22 → 12565.72] Like, you know, take my wife.
[12565.82 → 12572.34] She is super focused, but doesn't have that same creative dragon energy that I do.
[12572.34 → 12575.02] So she found a partner that fills her holes, right?
[12579.86 → 12580.76] Which is good.
[12581.82 → 12583.82] I was not going to dignify that.
[12586.06 → 12590.34] I'm recognizing some of the words that were said now because I was very focused on what
[12590.34 → 12590.90] I was typing.
[12591.64 → 12592.12] Wow.
[12593.20 → 12593.68] Wow.
[12594.90 → 12595.30] Wow.
[12596.18 → 12601.30] We have five seconds left until our end of time.
[12602.86 → 12604.02] Let's not leave there.
[12606.72 → 12607.38] All right.
[12608.88 → 12610.08] We still got some incoming.
[12611.00 → 12612.70] Leaving it there would be so funny, though.
[12613.12 → 12614.04] Just end the stream.
[12616.12 → 12618.10] If you say bye, I have to play the outro.
[12618.40 → 12620.30] It would be a bit of a flaccid point to leave it on.
[12620.38 → 12621.00] We should keep going.
[12621.12 → 12621.48] Yay!
[12623.64 → 12624.56] Nice one, Luke.
[12624.92 → 12626.76] I haven't had one of those from you for a long time.
[12626.76 → 12632.70] Any more incoming than pique your interest?
[12634.32 → 12637.40] How about Luke goes through that while I rapid fire try to respond to them?
[12637.96 → 12638.38] Sounds good.
[12638.64 → 12638.94] Okay.
[12640.82 → 12642.42] So you're reading them out, to be clear.
[12643.30 → 12643.62] Okay.
[12644.62 → 12649.20] Sweet replacement to my Horus P3X Thunder.
[12649.36 → 12649.86] Two questions.
[12650.00 → 12652.42] Any plans for Power Play compatible sizes of the pads?
[12652.42 → 12656.54] And any on the accounting team slated for an AMD upgrade?
[12656.70 → 12658.68] My wife is actually getting an upgrade.
[12658.96 → 12660.52] She's technically on the accounting team.
[12661.34 → 12664.30] As for Power Play compatible sizes of the pads,
[12664.94 → 12669.46] yeah, I think the 30 centimetre tall one fits over top of a pad.
[12669.92 → 12672.88] You can see it in any of my recent setup videos.
[12672.88 → 12674.94] So it just lays across it.
[12675.10 → 12676.20] And that's how I use it.
[12677.36 → 12677.72] Hello.
[12677.90 → 12681.16] First, I'm making it live to the WAN show and leaving a merch message.
[12681.60 → 12683.62] Do gift card values accumulate in my account?
[12683.72 → 12686.14] Or is it like I can only use one per purchase?
[12686.28 → 12686.98] Love you guys.
[12687.92 → 12689.66] They don't sit in your account.
[12689.76 → 12690.40] I don't think.
[12690.46 → 12691.52] I actually don't know how they work.
[12691.60 → 12693.30] I've never bought a gift card from my own store.
[12693.52 → 12694.30] Technically me either.
[12694.56 → 12694.76] Yeah.
[12694.92 → 12695.72] I think.
[12695.96 → 12698.06] I don't think it's maximum one per purchase.
[12698.26 → 12698.78] No, no.
[12698.80 → 12700.50] You can definitely use more than one per purchase.
[12700.58 → 12700.96] I know that.
[12700.96 → 12703.00] Yeah, I don't know if it's a code or not.
[12703.04 → 12703.92] I think it's a code.
[12705.52 → 12706.46] Shopify support.
[12706.58 → 12706.96] I don't know.
[12707.18 → 12707.66] I'm not sure.
[12707.98 → 12709.50] You could ask support.
[12709.78 → 12710.02] Yeah.
[12710.20 → 12712.14] Or it is a Shopify discard.
[12712.32 → 12713.44] So it's probably very Google.
[12713.44 → 12715.88] We have a new button in the merch message thing.
[12715.98 → 12717.34] What you can do is you can hit support.
[12717.56 → 12719.50] And then it'll create a ticket for our support team.
[12719.82 → 12724.10] And then our support team should reach out to you via email that you left your merch message.
[12725.80 → 12726.62] Okay, next up.
[12726.74 → 12727.08] Hey, DLL.
[12727.72 → 12728.74] That one just disappeared.
[12728.74 → 12733.58] Do you think there's a work opportunity for people with many skills rather than focusing on one?
[12733.98 → 12740.56] I'm a shareholder rep at 29 years old, but I used to be in UX and videography and with a degree in linguistics.
[12740.84 → 12741.28] Yeah, totally.
[12741.48 → 12742.16] What do you think, Dan?
[12742.40 → 12744.20] That's YouTubers in a nutshell.
[12745.42 → 12746.14] Hell yeah.
[12747.36 → 12747.80] Yeah.
[12747.86 → 12749.96] You'll probably have to find a spot at a smaller company.
[12750.48 → 12752.14] Yeah, smaller companies definitely work better.
[12752.38 → 12752.68] But yes.
[12753.26 → 12753.74] Acknowledge the...
[12754.62 → 12755.48] See ya.
[12755.66 → 12756.06] Bye.
[12756.06 → 12759.90] Have you seen the Kickstarter for the Flux keyboard?
[12760.10 → 12761.96] It's very interesting and something I've never seen before.
[12762.44 → 12762.68] Yes.
[12763.00 → 12763.52] It's cool.
[12766.14 → 12774.90] How much time in a given work day do you guys consider appropriate to give organizing or documenting outlying clutter from projects around your desk?
[12774.90 → 12777.84] Well, we have five people.
[12777.94 → 12778.38] Six now?
[12778.50 → 12781.56] We have a lot of people in the logistics department, so they help.
[12782.34 → 12787.98] As for how much is appropriate, well, you're going to have to do it one way or another.
[12788.38 → 12793.18] You can either do it as you go, you can do it when you're done, but it has to be done, so it's however much it is.
[12794.32 → 12795.62] I didn't really hear the question, but yeah.
[12796.06 → 12798.30] How much time should we spend cleaning your desk?
[12798.82 → 12799.74] Shout out to Gianni!
[12799.74 → 12811.60] Hey, Dale L. I asked Bing to generate some questions for WAN Show, and my favourite one of the list was, what are some of your favourite virtual reality experiences?
[12813.90 → 12816.04] I actually really enjoyed Lucky's Tale.
[12816.04 → 12827.00] It was the first game that I played that I, even though it's like a controller game, I just felt so immersed in the world, even though it's just a platformer game.
[12827.24 → 12831.84] Lucky's Tale was the first, like, this is an actual game and not just a tech demo.
[12831.94 → 12834.98] Not just like a roller coaster you sit on and feel nauseated, right?
[12835.18 → 12835.32] Yeah.
[12836.20 → 12836.56] Yeah.
[12837.14 → 12841.20] My favourite experience really was just like watching people get far too into it.
[12841.20 → 12848.92] When you see people physically react by way leaning out of the way, or jumping because they think they're actually going to get hit by it or whatever.
[12849.10 → 12851.38] Like being afraid of a cliff, like walking a tightrope, like ooh!
[12851.74 → 12854.88] Richie's plank experience is a classic for that.
[12855.24 → 12855.36] Yeah.

[12862.72 → 12865.14] Honestly, how do you folks make money on these?
[12865.14 → 12868.68] 64 ounce bottle for 30 US dollars and wood quality?
[12868.84 → 12869.34] It's great.

[12890.50 → 12892.76] I missed the rest of that chat because you sent it at the end.
[12893.70 → 12894.86] Oh my goodness.
[12894.86 → 12896.56] That's what happens when we pause the queue.
