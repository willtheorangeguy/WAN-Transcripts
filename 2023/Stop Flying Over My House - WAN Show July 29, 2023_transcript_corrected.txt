[0.00 → 11.00] What is up everybody and welcome to a very special, very fantastic, very live edition of the WAN Show here at LTX 2023.
[11.00 → 14.00] Can we get the crowd came up here for a second?
[14.00 → 17.00] Hey guys, say hi to the WAN Show audience!
[19.00 → 21.00] Let's go!
[21.00 → 29.00] Alright, we've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys today because if we don't, you can actually mob us.
[29.00 → 31.00] Oh.
[31.00 → 37.00] An insurance company in the States is using drones to spy on their policyholders.
[37.00 → 40.00] What are the implications of this?
[40.00 → 43.00] Are we actually living in the worst dystopian timeline?
[43.00 → 44.00] Yes.
[44.00 → 47.00] I think so, because Twitter is no longer a bird.
[47.00 → 50.00] It's just a placeholder.
[50.00 → 54.00] They were like, we couldn't think of any branding, let's just put an X.
[54.00 → 56.00] We're going to be talking about that. What else we got today, Luke?
[56.00 → 58.00] Did you just segue from topics?
[58.00 → 59.00] I did.
[59.00 → 60.00] I think that's a first.
[60.00 → 61.00] I've levelled up.
[61.00 → 62.00] That's actually amazing.
[62.00 → 63.00] Okay.
[63.00 → 64.00] I don't know.
[64.00 → 66.00] ESB wants to age scan your face.
[66.00 → 69.00] No, that's more dystopian timeline!
[69.00 → 70.00] Stop!
[70.00 → 71.00] But it fits the theme of the show!
[71.00 → 72.00] No, it's not the theme of the...
[72.00 → 73.00] It's okay.
[73.00 → 75.00] Are you going to do the one right after it too?
[75.00 → 77.00] No, I was actually going to skip that.
[77.00 → 79.00] No, not the online casinos targeting children?
[79.00 → 90.00] Yeah, I think it's interesting to talk about, which I didn't title this properly, but War gaming, specifically for World of Warships, is getting rid of their forums entirely.
[90.00 → 92.00] It's just done.
[92.00 → 93.00] No more forums.
[93.00 → 94.00] Come on!
[94.00 → 95.00] Forums are still cool!
[95.00 → 101.00] And Warships specifically, they have actual technical documentation on their forums that is sorted and easy to find.
[101.00 → 104.00] It's actually some of the most important forums there are.
[104.00 → 105.00] And they're gone.
[105.00 → 106.00] They're going to Discord.
[106.00 → 107.00] Cool.
[107.00 → 108.00] Roll that intro!
[108.00 → 109.00] Woo!
[109.00 → 110.00] It's Dan.
[110.00 → 111.00] They do it?
[111.00 → 112.00] They do it.
[112.00 → 113.00] Roll the intro.
[113.00 → 115.00] Why are you even here, Dan?
[115.00 → 116.00] I don't know!
[116.00 → 119.00] I didn't sign up for this.
[119.00 → 121.00] You did sign up for this!
[121.00 → 122.00] Oh yeah.
[122.00 → 123.00] You organized this!
[123.00 → 124.00] Oops.
[124.00 → 125.00] Is it?
[125.00 → 131.00] It's like hosting a party and then complaining that the food sucks.
[131.00 → 133.00] Yeah, I cooked the food.
[133.00 → 136.00] The nice thing is that we get to deflect blame a third time.
[136.00 → 137.00] True.
[137.00 → 138.00] That is pretty good.
[138.00 → 139.00] I'll go deal with this.
[139.00 → 140.00] Are they actually going to roll the intro though?
[140.00 → 141.00] I'll be back in a minute.
[141.00 → 144.00] Okay, Dan's going to go back there and roll the intro.
[144.00 → 145.00] Let's go, Dan!
[145.00 → 146.00] Hey!

[193.00 → 194.00] Woo!
[194.00 → 194.94] Woo!
[194.94 → 202.38] showed and this is amazing potential hazards in his yard if I was going to lose
[202.38 → 206.22] my home insurance just based on the potential hazards in my yard I would
[206.22 → 212.10] have had no home insurance for the last two years or empty hole that is dug in
[212.10 → 217.74] the back of my yard where my pool is supposed to be yeah no insurance and I
[217.74 → 222.30] have a hole in my yard it would be fair it made us both bleed literally that is
[222.30 → 225.84] true we have both bled in the pool already yeah not in like a weird way
[225.84 → 234.60] though anyway these potential hazards Sven is a tinkerer who's restoring a 1966
[234.60 → 238.56] Chevy which is extremely normal which is a totally normal thing what is the point
[238.56 → 248.46] of having a yard if you can't have a car on cinder blocks in it America or North
[248.46 → 253.44] America this is where it gets absolutely crazy though Spain contacted
[253.44 → 258.60] the insurer at which point representatives claimed that they had sent a drone over
[258.60 → 265.02] his property to acquire the photo they didn't even have the sense to deny this
[265.02 → 271.92] unbelievable invasion of privacy they're like yeah we denied we sent a drone
[271.92 → 277.08] over your house which by the way are like are you even allowed to do how big is this
[277.08 → 282.06] drone how heavy is this drone did it have a flight plan like I have absolutely no idea
[282.06 → 287.64] how you can justify this is an egregious invasion of personal property what they did
[287.64 → 292.86] deny was his request to even see the photos at all or address any of the issues in his
[292.86 → 296.64] yard they're just like no it doesn't matter if you solve it no more insurance that's it
[296.64 → 301.44] you're done forget about insurance many California insurers have apparently been
[301.44 → 309.96] trying to find any excuse to deny insurance on properties due to wildfire risk I mean okay so
[309.96 → 318.48] hold on a second I don't even have to actually send the drone I can just say I put a drone over your
[318.48 → 325.50] property deny your insurance your ability to get insurance refuse to show you any of the pictures and
[325.50 → 338.50] and then yeah good enough yeah sorry dog um so hey um you know you right there we saw you doing something bad
[338.50 → 347.50] uh I'm going to need I'm going to need your pass yeah you're out of LTX now sorry yeah no, no hold on a second there's a yeah no yeah
[347.50 → 354.50] yeah
[354.50 → 361.72] well what choice does he have I saw I saw him doing something bad I sent a drone over his desk at
[361.72 → 368.18] the LAN party yeah it was not allowed back the world's quietest smallest drone yeah you can't you
[368.18 → 372.58] can't see any evidence it happened yeah it 100% happened you know you're not getting this back now right
[372.58 → 379.58] okay, okay no, no oh he caught it nice that was good very nice
[379.58 → 388.84] here's the problem though speed's not even in the wildfire zone where insurers are trying to cancel
[388.84 → 395.50] insurance, and he hasn't made a claim in the 15 years he's had the policy okay is that is anyone here
[395.50 → 403.50] from California anyone wow that's um I'm not sure if that was better or worse than I expected
[403.50 → 409.50] it's fewer people than I expected or rather sorry it's more people than I expected, but it's less noise
[409.50 → 419.50] you guys are like yeah yeah yeah the Californians aren't thrilled that's fair um they're in California and
[419.50 → 426.50] that's why they're also in therapy
[426.50 → 439.50] but the plot actually thickens here when contacted by ABC 7 a local news outlet the CAA, so this is the
[439.50 → 447.50] uh the insurer denied that there had been any drone at all claiming that the photos might have been captured
[447.50 → 460.50] by fixed-wing airplane or satellite instead the CAA likewise refused to show any of these photos to ABC 7 okay so hold on a second I
[460.50 → 470.50] didn't see you do something bad with a drone I fired up Google Maps and in somewhere that you were at some point you did
[470.50 → 480.50] something bad so no insurance sorry get wrecked um I don't even know where to start with this like on the one hand there's the
[480.50 → 489.50] offensiveness of some random entity at some random time being allowed to take photos of your property because it's one thing if
[489.50 → 499.50] you're taking pictures of someone's behaviour on public property like for example insurers are well known for their practice of hiring private
[499.50 → 507.50] private investigators or even having internal teams that will go and see if you know mister back pain or
[507.50 → 514.50] missus I can't walk because of my knee is actually you know playing softball or spending all their time at the gym right this is
[514.50 → 522.50] something that we know about, but there are actually you know laws that allow them to photograph you or videography you in public space
[522.50 → 532.50] whereas this is like okay yeah technically I guess you don't necessarily only do you own do you only air above your property
[532.50 → 537.50] I think it also drastically depends on where you live like there's a note here saying that beyond restrictions on peeping Tom's
[537.50 → 544.50] there's no other laws at all preventing this type of surveillance so it might here right, so I'm pretty sure you can't do that here
[544.50 → 551.50] I think that's actually like a no-no but in California maybe it's okay man that's absolutely
[551.50 → 558.50] it's wild that's wild yeah and guess what things are about to get even more wild in other news the ESB
[558.50 → 569.50] wants to age scan your face I mean hey they've got it in China, and it's working out great for them
[569.50 → 581.50] fantastic the entertainment software rating board has made a joint filing to the FTC alongside digital identity company
[581.50 → 589.50] Yogi who I've definitely super heard of, and I'm sure has the best security practices totally trust them and digital media company
[589.50 → 598.50] super awesome for permission to use a system called privacy protective facial age estimation
[598.50 → 608.50] yeah the system requires the users to take a photo of themselves check whether the face in the frame is live
[608.50 → 615.50] then sends the photo to a remote server where it is AI analyzed to determine the approximate age of its subject
[615.50 → 620.50] the ESB says the system will delete images immediately after use sure
[620.50 → 626.50] someone's going to backdoor that in like four years find the entire archive
[626.50 → 635.50] sorry where is it they also have a website for if it's going to be called backdoor it's going to be called backdoor photos
[635.50 → 642.50] dot Facebook by the way don't go to that URL I wouldn't actually recommend going to that one either
[642.50 → 650.50] yeah it's probably not a bad idea they also stated that they would not use the system as an age gate to prevent children from purchasing and or downloading
[650.50 → 652.50] restrictively rated video games
[652.50 → 654.50] well wait what is the point of this
[654.50 → 658.50] I suddenly have no idea
[658.50 → 662.50] wait Luke no I'm totally over it I actually want this
[662.50 → 668.50] everyone's allowed to buy the game, but I don't have to listen to 12-year-olds in the lobby
[668.50 → 670.50] so they can't play it
[670.50 → 674.50] it actually hard locks they're always on microphone
[674.50 → 678.50] yeah
[678.50 → 682.50] yeah
[682.50 → 690.50] what is more likely is that the system might be used by publishers looking to remain compliant with the children's online privacy protection act or COPPA
[690.50 → 697.50] which requires verifiable parental consent before collecting or sharing the personal information of children under 13.
[697.50 → 708.50] Epic Games Super Awesome's parent company interesting agreed to a 275 million dollar penalty for violating COPPA this past December
[708.50 → 712.50] I mean the thing that's frustrating about this for me is can I make a crazy suggestion
[712.50 → 721.50] how about if what you're doing is so egregious that doing it to children results in a 275 million dollar fine
[721.50 → 724.50] how about you just not do that to anybody
[724.50 → 726.50] yeah anybody at all that'd be great
[726.50 → 728.50] I mean it's a crazy idea I know
[728.50 → 733.50] yeah I know you know what no, no don't applaud that I'm sorry that was a stupid thing to say
[733.50 → 734.50] we can't do that
[734.50 → 740.50] yeah we shouldn't, we shouldn't do that we should take as much information from people as possible in fact here at LTX
[740.50 → 743.50] can we can come back to the crowd cam
[743.50 → 744.50] okay
[744.50 → 751.50] so who here gave their name and date of birth in order to buy a ticket
[751.50 → 753.50] okay, okay
[753.50 → 757.50] um who here was photographed at some point during the event
[757.50 → 759.50] okay, so this is good this is good personal
[759.50 → 761.50] don't raise your hand you're lying
[761.50 → 762.50] okay
[762.50 → 763.50] okay
[763.50 → 769.50] now I spoke with the team before the show here, and I asked them to make sure that they got a blood sample from everybody who came through
[769.50 → 771.50] who gave a blood sample
[771.50 → 772.50] okay good
[772.50 → 773.50] very good very good
[773.50 → 775.50] any semen samples
[775.50 → 780.50] okay we're going to come back to the two shot please thank you
[780.50 → 782.50] I don't know if we want that last one
[782.50 → 785.50] there was no official collection of semen samples
[785.50 → 787.50] so whoever you gave it to
[787.50 → 789.50] weird kink
[789.50 → 792.50] might want to follow up in nine months
[792.50 → 797.50] Yogi claims
[797.50 → 808.50] Yogi claims that the AI has a 99.7% accuracy rate for distinguishing the faces of miners
[808.50 → 815.50] and it considers things like whether say an 18-year-old could count or could have a 14-year-old kid
[815.50 → 817.50] okay
[817.50 → 824.50] Yogi system is also under trial in the UK to check whether customers are old enough to buy alcohol
[824.50 → 830.50] and requires anyone that the AI judges to look 25 or younger to show ID
[830.50 → 834.50] I um here's my problem right now
[834.50 → 837.50] I don't have a better solution
[837.50 → 845.50] we've talked extensively on the WAN show about these uh like whether it's governmental or whether it's a third party
[845.50 → 851.50] these uh identity collection entities basically just turning into gigantic honeypots
[851.50 → 855.50] anything that's gonna hold this information is going to be a target
[855.50 → 866.50] and so if the solution is hey well instead of holding information why don't we just use an AI to determine what we need to now and then immediately delete the data
[866.50 → 868.50] it's actually a pretty sound idea
[868.50 → 870.50] but why do they even need to collect it in the first place
[870.50 → 872.50] well that's the thing right
[872.50 → 876.50] well you can't analyze a picture without having it at some point
[876.50 → 878.50] but who cares
[878.50 → 880.50] the problem is that I just don't
[880.50 → 882.50] okay well that's a separate conversation
[882.50 → 883.50] yeah
[883.50 → 890.50] right but okay so let's take all the different various things that you might want to verify age for online
[890.50 → 893.50] you know whether it's um viewing adult content
[893.50 → 897.50] and adult content doesn't necessarily mean you know twitter rated content
[897.50 → 906.50] a lot of which can be found on x.com by the way you don't have to look that hard
[906.50 → 911.50] um and I'm not even necessarily talking about that I could be talking about something as simple as an R rated movie right
[911.50 → 914.50] like it's its it's not like there isn't a value to something like this
[914.50 → 918.50] you know say for example if you know
[918.50 → 925.50] I mean certain news stories might be age gated if they're showing a certain level of content
[925.50 → 928.50] yeah sure like something graphic I think that's a pretty good example
[928.50 → 933.50] absolutely you know even something as simple as like uh whatever Google calls the play store now
[933.50 → 938.50] whatever the movies yeah I don't know you're on you can rent movies on YouTube sure fine
[938.50 → 942.50] you know if they could age gate an R rated movie or something like that you know
[942.50 → 952.50] I don't necessarily see that as an entirely terrible thing it's just that we've been betrayed over and over and over and over again
[952.50 → 956.50] when it comes to the collection of this data to the point where you were just laughing about it
[956.50 → 960.50] you're like yeah in four years it's going to turn out they kept all of them
[960.50 → 967.50] they're gonna they're going to make some excuse right they're going to say oh we had to have it so that we could train the AI better
[967.50 → 972.50] we didn't realize that caching server wasn't getting garbage collection
[972.50 → 975.50] we didn't realize it was just a completely unprotected FTP with no password on it
[975.50 → 982.50] oh we delete it immediately except the server that it goes to is completely unprotected, so people just scrape it as it comes in like I don't know
[982.50 → 986.50] like there's there are issues here's a question for you haven't told me about
[986.50 → 989.50] here's a question for you, you know too much about this
[989.50 → 1003.50] it's just too easy man as someone who has kids would you be happy to make it so that they're you know less likely to run into things that you don't want them to run into in a trade for their face being scanned every single time of the world
[1003.50 → 1006.50] their face being scanned every single time they attempt to do so
[1006.50 → 1016.50] because I feel like that's not worth it understand parental controls on like everything are basically garbage and there's really, really easy ways to get around it
[1016.50 → 1020.50] yeah, but I feel like there's probably pretty easy ways to get around this too
[1020.50 → 1032.50] this is a really tough conversation I almost feel like I wish we were it's a funny thing right it's not like the WAN show is any different all you guys would have been watching it anyway you're just like here in person, but I almost feel like you know this is a really personal
[1032.50 → 1041.50] yeah it's a personal question stop looking I'd be fine answering it with just you know you there, and I guess Dan is also there usually but
[1041.50 → 1045.50] oh he's so cute look at him oh
[1045.50 → 1051.50] you know I don't really I don't really know the right answer to that because you know compared okay wow we're gonna we're going to get real here
[1051.50 → 1065.50] when I was a young lad of you know 13 14 oh it was pretty easy to find inappropriate content on the internet you know for my dad's here I got grounded for a month for that age
[1065.50 → 1079.50] have you told the story of why I can't, I can, it's because it's because he printed it
[1079.50 → 1083.50] okay, okay
[1083.50 → 1088.50] tell me this
[1088.50 → 1103.50] was it at least 16 bit or was it 256 colour it was okay it was okay it's a little older than him so we only had 256 colour we considered ourselves lucky
[1103.50 → 1110.50] yeah the situation was back then you know you don't have laptops you don't have smartphones so if you wanted the content in your room
[1110.50 → 1133.50] so the point is the point is it was relatively hard to get your hands on stuff, and it was relatively benign compared to what just pops up in my feed on x.com when I am just looking at what's trending and scrolling down, and you just see people like
[1133.50 → 1145.50] which for the uninformed is twitter jumping onto these yeah jumping onto these trending hashtags or whatever the case may be right and so it's something that you know Yvonne and I have talked about a fair bit
[1145.50 → 1158.50] it's like realistically we cannot stop our kids from getting access to pretty much whatever they want, and you know honestly speaking I feel like pornography is a pretty low-hanging fruit like right like it's an easy target
[1158.50 → 1175.50] oh think of the children what about the pornography right and there's obviously some very valid conversations to be had there about it, but there 's's really, really disturbing stuff on the internet right like it's its not just about that
[1175.50 → 1187.50] especially right now actually with the war in Ukraine this is like the most documented war I've ever seen, and you can find live footage of stuff that could be very disturbing to people
[1187.50 → 1209.50] very traumatic not protected by anything and this solution is not going to apply to every single website to every single service to every single I'm connecting to this through my Nintendo DS type of way that you could access things so it is like you're just going to be collecting people's faces, but there will be other ways to get things so the short version of it is you know we've
[1209.50 → 1219.50] I hope that if my kids ever watch this WAN show or this segment of the WAN show I hope that we don't use the printer
[1219.50 → 1227.50] I got Yvonne a sick printer for a
[1227.50 → 1257.48] uh that's not why I don't know we have a really nice printer anyway you know I hope that they would feel like we followed through on what we've talked about which is um we've resolved to talk to them about things uh understand that we're never going to be able to rely on parental controls uh try to put try to frame things in the appropriate context to help them make good decisions to
[1257.48 → 1263.48] um understand that they're not really understand that they're not really
[1263.48 → 1285.48] um and realistically understand that at the end of the day children are just little tiny adults right like they are it's amazing how fast they change right you know anyone with kids how mind-blowing is it right they go from you know hiding behind you when a stranger comes into the room to you know talking back to the stranger, and you're like happy
[1285.48 → 1303.48] it happens so fast um, so now is it is no I don't want I don't want people collecting pictures is it public how old your son is um ish okay so last time we were over uh you were comparing heights
[1303.48 → 1331.48] and and and he was like going to bed and you said that he had to go to bed because he was whatever age, and then you were like wait come back we're going to collect heights and when he comes around the corner he's like I'm and then says his age instead of like introducing himself as his name because you would refer to him as his age and just I can't do it right now because I can't say the age I'm going to keep it private, but the comedic delivery was like just tell the story properly it's fine I can say it yeah yeah so
[1331.48 → 1342.48] he was referring to him as 11. yeah, and he goes around this wall and then comes back around the wall like arms plastered to his side kind of waddle him a little bit he's like I'm 11.
[1342.48 → 1357.48] just the the the comedic timing of it and everything was genuinely very, very funny, and it wasn't funny like just because lol little kid it was funny because of the timing and how he did it and stuff like it, he's got the snark yeah he's a little
[1357.48 → 1372.48] he's running around this is kind of terrifying yeah my answer is no, no I don't want them participating in any of this as especially because it's got like you said it's all going to be for nothing
[1372.48 → 1382.48] yeah there 's's going to be there's going to be like maybe you know steam supports it and maybe epic game store supports it but battle state games stupid launchers
[1382.48 → 1399.48] no shot yeah there's no way they're going to support it right I mean I'm not even I'm not even sure how long uh uh uh like Activision blizzard zone launcher battle.net I'm not even sure how long that is for this world now that their games are on steam now it kind of feels like the first step toward throwing in the tie the towel right so
[1399.48 → 1426.48] to be clear I am expecting them to carry that on for a very long time that 30% take is pretty brutal but like I'm just I'm looking at it going for what like if I have to participate in this system you know hey at least maybe it could be something that actually is universally adopted, and it has some kind of meaningful function but be careful with that too because another topic that didn't actually really make it into the, or it did the Google DRM browser stuff.
[1426.48 → 1441.48] Okay we will get to that later but what we haven't talked about that is directly related to this topic is by and large I think the ESB's function is one that I don't object to really meaningfully.
[1441.48 → 1443.48] The goal at least?
[1443.48 → 1470.48] Yeah with the goal of keeping you know really kind of um inappropriate content out of the hands of people who are maybe not at a mentally developed stage where they fully understand it and are ready to process it, and you know what to be clear I think that 99% of even kids can very well understand the difference between animated video game violence and real world violence, but it only takes a small handful.
[1470.48 → 1487.48] Like that's something that I've learned over and over and over and over and over again is that if only 0.1% of people um act in a certain way that's that's like okay so hold on a second what are we up to like 8 billion now?
[1487.48 → 1504.48] Well so 10 so 10 is 800 million and 1% is 80 million and 0.1% is 8 million people could do something right, and obviously you can't rubber you can't turn the whole world into a rubber padded room right like that's not gonna work anyway that's not realistic.
[1504.48 → 1513.48] But when I look at this technology I go even though largely I kind of agree with the goal of the ESB.
[1513.48 → 1519.48] Every time we see this stuff I look at AI and I go oh man.
[1519.48 → 1536.48] So now you're going to have an authoritarian regime that's using this to ensure that you know um and not tell you know oh hey you can't buy that game, but they're going to be monitoring what games you're playing, and they're going to be filing that away with your social credit score or whatever the case may be.
[1536.48 → 1542.48] And I just thought of this now, but they might delete the picture, but they might not delete the analytics from the picture.
[1542.48 → 1550.48] So they could scan things like eye colour, skin colour, do you have a beard, do you not have a beard, like how much do you weigh?
[1550.48 → 1558.48] You can probably check certain fat percentages from people's faces to a certain degree different things like this they can harvest a lot of information about you from a photo of your face.
[1558.48 → 1560.48] I didn't say anything about that.
[1560.48 → 1567.48] It's funny because there's a lot of there's a big societal push toward less profiling and yet the tools that we're building.
[1567.48 → 1569.48] Just more and more profiling all the time.
[1569.48 → 1574.48] Are supercharging our ability to profile people just based on their appearance, based on their preferences.
[1574.48 → 1578.48] You know I remember having a hilarious conversation.
[1578.48 → 1584.48] It might have been at the first LTX actually which is great like six years ago now.
[1584.48 → 1585.48] Right?
[1585.48 → 1592.48] Anyway, I remember having a conversation where I ran into one of our few, you know, female viewers.
[1592.48 → 1597.48] And I was like, oh, hey this is unusual.
[1597.48 → 1600.48] Do you want to take a picture for your boyfriend?
[1600.48 → 1602.48] Because that's usually it.
[1602.48 → 1604.48] You can't do that though.
[1604.48 → 1605.48] No, but that's usually.
[1605.48 → 1607.48] Yeah, but you can't do that though.
[1607.48 → 1608.48] This is on topic.
[1608.48 → 1609.48] Because it's not always.
[1609.48 → 1610.48] Luke, this is on topic.
[1610.48 → 1618.48] And the point is we ended up getting into a bit of a conversation where she goes, yeah, that's like my whole life is because I'm into tech.
[1618.48 → 1619.48] And that's why you can't do that.
[1619.48 → 1620.48] I know.
[1620.48 → 1621.48] I'm coming to this Luke.
[1621.48 → 1622.48] Okay, okay.
[1622.48 → 1628.48] Because I'm into tech and because I'm into cars and because I'm into engineering.
[1628.48 → 1635.48] You know, every ad service where I go, and I poke into it, they just assume I'm a man.
[1635.48 → 1636.48] And they profile me like this.
[1636.48 → 1640.48] And I was like, deeply, sorry.
[1640.48 → 1643.48] Clearly part of the problem.
[1643.48 → 1649.48] But it was such a wake-up call as to why we actually can't do this.
[1649.48 → 1661.48] I mean, the problem is that in that case, the system kind of worked based on all the categories of ads and products or whatever that they add for men and like serving them to her.
[1661.48 → 1665.48] She was like, yeah, I actually get very relevant ads.
[1665.48 → 1666.48] Yeah.
[1666.48 → 1669.48] But I still object to it.
[1669.48 → 1670.48] Which is fair.
[1670.48 → 1671.48] Yeah.
[1671.48 → 1674.48] All right, Dan, you don't have your thing on your thing.
[1674.48 → 1676.48] So you might just have to kind of jump in when we're supposed to do a thing.
[1676.48 → 1680.48] I think we're supposed to introduce the concept of merch messages and do a couple of merch messages.
[1680.48 → 1681.48] Yeah, sure if you want.
[1681.48 → 1682.48] Yeah, whatever.
[1682.48 → 1683.48] What do you mean sure if I want?
[1683.48 → 1688.48] No, it's producer Dan, not just go with the flow Dan.
[1688.48 → 1690.48] You're supposed to be helping us here.
[1690.48 → 1691.48] Okay, sure.
[1691.48 → 1692.48] All right.
[1692.48 → 1697.48] If for those of you who are unfamiliar with the concept, merch messages are the way to interact with the show.
[1697.48 → 1698.48] We don't do super chats.
[1698.48 → 1699.48] We don't do Twitch bits.
[1699.48 → 1705.48] We feel like, hey, if you're going to throw money at the screen, you might as well throw money at the screen in a way that gets you some
[1705.48 → 1714.48] fine, high quality merchandise from LTTstore.com in a few days or a few weeks, or it depends on the customs of your country.
[1714.48 → 1720.48] I've heard all kinds of horror stories about like people needing to like to bribe their customs officials in order to get...
[1720.48 → 1722.48] I cannot control that.
[1722.48 → 1724.48] I'm deeply sorry, but there's nothing I can do about it.
[1724.48 → 1731.48] So merch messages are sent by going to LTTstore.com and in the cart, there's a field whenever we're live.
[1731.48 → 1733.48] You can go ahead and send a little message.
[1733.48 → 1735.48] It'll pop up on the bottom of the show.
[1735.48 → 1737.48] Like this.
[1737.48 → 1740.48] Yeah, like that.
[1740.48 → 1747.48] Or producer Dan will type a little reply to you, or he will curate it for me and Luke to chat about.
[1747.48 → 1749.48] So Dan, you got any merch messages for us?
[1749.48 → 1750.48] I do, actually.
[1750.48 → 1751.48] We have a couple here.
[1751.48 → 1752.48] First up is from Sam.
[1752.48 → 1753.48] Hi Linus.
[1753.48 → 1755.48] Love the show as always.
[1755.48 → 1758.48] One request, make the audience crack their fingers.
[1758.48 → 1762.48] Why on earth would you read that?
[1762.48 → 1765.48] Are you trying to upset everybody?
[1765.48 → 1766.48] Yes.
[1766.48 → 1770.48] I don't think they're going to be able to hear it.
[1770.48 → 1772.48] I mean, okay, I'll tell you what.
[1772.48 → 1775.48] Three, two, one, go for it.
[1775.48 → 1776.48] Yes.
[1781.48 → 1784.48] Okay, moving on.
[1784.48 → 1785.48] Next up is from Calvin.
[1785.48 → 1786.48] This one's less gross.
[1786.48 → 1788.48] Hi Linus in Chicago.
[1788.48 → 1791.48] I saw a billboard that was LTT tech support.
[1791.48 → 1795.48] Have you ever had difficulty securing a trademark or web domain?
[1795.48 → 1797.48] How did it go?
[1797.48 → 1799.48] It's actually LLT tech support.
[1799.48 → 1805.48] They apparently feared our fierce legal team too much to call it LTT tech support.
[1805.48 → 1808.48] But yes, absolutely.
[1808.48 → 1810.48] We've, man, we've run into everything.
[1810.48 → 1813.48] Part of my problem is I talk too much.
[1817.48 → 1824.48] We ended up having to, and I shouldn't even say that we did this because I'm going to exacerbate the problem.
[1824.48 → 1833.48] But we ended up paying a domain squatter to get creator warehouse.com because we announced the name of our company creator warehouse.
[1833.48 → 1839.48] The sub company that works on all of our merch before actually securing the domain.
[1839.48 → 1841.48] And then someone went and grabbed it.
[1841.48 → 1842.48] And you know what?
[1842.48 → 1844.48] I have to give props to our community.
[1844.48 → 1846.48] Most of the time that happens.
[1846.48 → 1850.48] It happens a lot because I talk a lot.
[1851.48 → 1853.48] Most of the time that happens.
[1853.48 → 1856.48] People are like, hey, I've actually been holding onto this for you.
[1856.48 → 1863.48] You know, I would take a token, you know, couple bucks to cover the amount that I've spent holding onto this domain for you.
[1863.48 → 1865.48] I figured you guys would come knocking eventually.
[1865.48 → 1867.48] Most of the time it's like that.
[1867.48 → 1871.48] But yeah, we ended up paying a domain squatter for creator warehouse.com.
[1871.48 → 1888.48] And I think the other side of the flip side, the other answer to that question is that even aside from the ones that do exist and are available domains at the time that we come up with a brand or come up with a company name or whatever else.
[1888.48 → 1894.48] There are the ones where they're not available and that can be extremely challenging, man.
[1894.48 → 1899.48] Trying to come up with something that isn't already taken at this point is really hard.
[1899.48 → 1903.48] I mean, we've been told countless times, flowplane.com, that's a stupid name.
[1903.48 → 1904.48] Fine.
[1904.48 → 1905.48] What's a better one?
[1905.48 → 1912.48] You find a 10character.com that's available that uses actual real dictionary words.
[1912.48 → 1913.48] I'll wait.
[1913.48 → 1915.48] It was really hard for us too.
[1915.48 → 1920.48] Unfortunately, the whole story of how we got it is like sort of gone forever.
[1920.48 → 1921.48] Really?
[1921.48 → 1922.48] Did you know that?
[1922.48 → 1923.48] No.
[1923.48 → 1926.48] Remember when you like closed the Google services for that domain?
[1926.48 → 1927.48] Oh, yeah.
[1927.48 → 1929.48] The club domain.
[1929.48 → 1930.48] Oh.
[1930.48 → 1944.48] The doc that had the entire history of how I did all of that, and you like showing up and knocking at the person's door and me diving through lineage pages to figure out who was related to who in the Freemason thing and all this kind of stuff.
[1944.48 → 1945.48] Yeah.
[1945.48 → 1947.48] That actually all happened, and it's gone.
[1947.48 → 1953.48] And then us agreeing to host like the son of the person who owned it.
[1953.48 → 1954.48] At LTX.
[1954.48 → 1957.48] At LTX in exchange for them even agreeing to sell it to us.
[1957.48 → 1958.48] Yeah.
[1958.48 → 1962.48] I mean, we remember bits and pieces, but yeah, I don't remember the exact story, which is.
[1962.48 → 1963.48] Yeah.
[1963.48 → 1964.48] I had it documented.
[1964.48 → 1965.48] It's gone.
[1965.48 → 1966.48] Yeah.
[1966.48 → 1967.48] Yeah.
[1967.48 → 1968.48] We used to have a worse name.
[1968.48 → 1969.48] Yeah.
[1969.48 → 1970.48] Float plane club.com.
[1970.48 → 1971.48] Yeah.
[1971.48 → 1972.48] That was bad.
[1972.48 → 1973.48] Could have been worse.
[1973.48 → 1976.48] At the time, there were a bunch of different things that were clubbed.
[1976.48 → 1979.48] There's Dollar Shave Club and all these other clubs.
[1979.48 → 1980.48] So it actually sort of fit in.
[1980.48 → 1981.48] I can't think of any others.
[1981.48 → 1982.48] Can you?
[1982.48 → 1983.48] Not anymore.
[1983.48 → 1984.48] Yeah.
[1984.48 → 1985.48] Yeah.
[1985.48 → 1986.48] Probably for a good reason.
[1986.48 → 1989.48] Oh, wasn't there like a Neopets type of club thing?
[1989.48 → 1990.48] Penguin.
[1990.48 → 1991.48] Yeah.
[1991.48 → 1992.48] I think club thing.
[1992.48 → 1993.48] That's a little older.
[1993.48 → 1995.48] I've been a little bit before.
[1995.48 → 1996.48] Yeah.
[1996.48 → 1997.48] Any who.
[1997.48 → 1999.48] All right, Dan, want to hit us with one or two more?
[1999.48 → 2000.48] Yeah, sure.
[2000.48 → 2001.48] Let's do another one here.
[2001.48 → 2002.48] Let's see.
[2002.48 → 2004.48] LTX 23.
[2004.48 → 2005.48] Let's go.
[2005.48 → 2010.48] Thanks for making the digital path content for those of us that cannot make it in person.
[2010.48 → 2015.48] Did any of you grow up watching computer chronicles on PBS?
[2015.48 → 2017.48] Fun to revisit the history of PCs.
[2017.48 → 2018.48] Isn't PBS American?
[2018.48 → 2019.48] Computer Chronicles?
[2019.48 → 2020.48] Computer Chronicles?
[2020.48 → 2021.48] Oh, is it?
[2021.48 → 2022.48] Anyone?
[2022.48 → 2023.48] Computer Chronicles.
[2023.48 → 2024.48] Computer Chronicles?
[2024.48 → 2025.48] Who's seen it?
[2025.48 → 2026.48] Okay.
[2026.48 → 2028.48] That was pretty weak.
[2028.48 → 2030.48] Here, let's do PAW Patrol.
[2030.48 → 2031.48] Okay.
[2031.48 → 2039.48] Well, given how crap PAW Patrol is, I'm going to have to assume Computer Chronicles was...
[2039.48 → 2040.48] Wow.
[2040.48 → 2045.48] From 1983 to 2002, they did 428 episodes.
[2045.48 → 2047.48] Yeah, sorry.
[2047.48 → 2052.48] No, I have never heard of Computer Chronicles, but this looks delightfully 1980s.
[2052.48 → 2057.48] Unfortunately, I have no way of showing this to you other than, I don't know, this?
[2057.48 → 2058.48] I knew this would happen.
[2058.48 → 2059.48] I knew this would happen.
[2059.48 → 2060.48] Wow.
[2060.48 → 2064.48] New generation laptops from the Computer Chronicles.
[2064.48 → 2070.48] We had a discussion before the show about how he wasn't able to share his screen, therefore there would be no issues of leaks.
[2070.48 → 2071.48] And he found a way.
[2071.48 → 2073.48] I didn't think he'd just turn his computer around.
[2074.48 → 2076.48] Like, you'd just leak everything anyway.
[2076.48 → 2077.48] Professional.
[2077.48 → 2078.48] Love it.
[2078.48 → 2079.48] All right, Dan, hit me with one more.
[2079.48 → 2080.48] Sure, let's see here.
[2080.48 → 2081.48] Well, you got one more.
[2081.48 → 2082.48] Hi, LTX.
[2082.48 → 2083.48] Question for Linus.
[2083.48 → 2085.48] What happened to your Lamb?
[2085.48 → 2089.48] Did you ever do anything fun with it before getting rid of it?
[2089.48 → 2092.48] Loving the show and will try to be at LTX next year.
[2092.48 → 2111.48] Okay, for those of you who don't know the story of my old Lamb, which was a 2003 Honda Civic that ended up with a pink paint job, then ended up with green racing stripes, courtesy of Nicky V and the Channel Super Fun team, and then ended up looking like absolute garbage, courtesy of the attendees of LTX 2018.
[2111.48 → 2112.48] Yeah.
[2112.48 → 2114.48] That was not the goal.
[2114.48 → 2120.48] Yeah, I didn't expect people to just dump bottles of glitter glue inside the car.
[2120.48 → 2125.48] But they definitely did do, I actually did drive it for months afterward.
[2125.48 → 2127.48] Just, I don't know, it's still red.
[2127.48 → 2130.48] He would constantly have little bits of glitter on them.
[2130.48 → 2131.48] And I'm not kidding.
[2131.48 → 2133.48] It was like for months.
[2133.48 → 2134.48] It was rough.
[2134.48 → 2149.48] The reason that ended up at LTX 2018 was because I showed up the night before the event was supposed to open, having not really seen anything, and started just kind of freaking out about how light on the event was supposed to open.
[2149.48 → 2152.48] Light on content it was.
[2152.48 → 2156.48] With that said, I don't want to throw the team under the bus.
[2156.48 → 2158.48] They had very few resources.
[2158.48 → 2160.48] They had very little time.
[2160.48 → 2164.48] In fact, it is largely the same team that is still planning LTX.
[2164.48 → 2167.48] So they are, can we just get like a round of applause for...
[2167.48 → 2180.48] That's what I'm talking about.
[2180.48 → 2185.48] Obviously, these guys are capable of putting on a proper expo.
[2185.48 → 2190.48] We just needed a bit more experience, a little bit more resources.
[2190.48 → 2191.48] Hey, look, it's Colton.
[2194.48 → 2195.48] Ignored.
[2195.48 → 2199.48] He and his wife, Stuff, have...
[2199.48 → 2200.48] That's her real name, by the way.
[2200.48 → 2202.48] He and his wife, Stuff, have worked tirelessly.
[2202.48 → 2206.48] Chase, I just want to give a massive shout-out again to the team.
[2206.48 → 2208.48] This is absolutely incredible.
[2214.48 → 2217.48] Anyway, back to LTX 2018.
[2218.48 → 2221.48] I show up the night before, and I'm like, oh my goodness.
[2221.48 → 2226.48] One of our main attractions is Ivan's collection of old GPUs,
[2226.48 → 2230.48] which is basically just some outdated graphics cards on a table.
[2230.48 → 2231.48] On a table.
[2232.48 → 2233.48] We are screwed.
[2233.48 → 2234.48] Wow, they're here and not on the internet.
[2234.48 → 2236.48] We are actually screwed for tomorrow.
[2236.48 → 2238.48] People are going to ask for their money back.
[2238.48 → 2243.48] So I came up with the idea just to have some kind of interactive activation.
[2243.48 → 2247.48] Well, first, I kind of altered some of the booths and kind of went around with the team.
[2247.48 → 2248.48] It wasn't just me.
[2248.48 → 2251.48] We all brainstormed together to try to level things up a little bit.
[2251.48 → 2256.48] And I was like, okay, what if someone just hits the dollar store tomorrow morning
[2256.48 → 2259.48] and we'll let people interact with the famous Lamb.
[2259.48 → 2261.48] They can help decorate it.
[2261.48 → 2263.48] They could write their names or where they came from.
[2265.48 → 2269.48] They went a little off the rails with that, covering it in glitter, splashing it with paint.
[2269.48 → 2274.48] Not a square centimetre of it was left untouched inside or out.
[2274.48 → 2275.48] They even covered the windshield.
[2275.48 → 2280.48] I had to hang around for like an hour after the show to scrape off my windshield so I could drive home.
[2280.48 → 2286.48] So anyway, long story short, LTX is way better now, which is good.
[2286.48 → 2290.48] And that car was pretty unpleasant to drive.
[2290.48 → 2293.48] Like the seat upholstery was crusty.
[2294.48 → 2295.48] It was actually terrible.
[2295.48 → 2298.48] Yeah, like it would kind of poke into you through your shirt.
[2298.48 → 2302.48] So what ultimately ended up happening to it, we had wanted to do something cool.
[2302.48 → 2311.48] We wanted to do like enter it in a demolition derby or something like that on Channel Super Fun or blow it up with a tank or do something like that.
[2311.48 → 2319.48] But unfortunately, the costs associated, and the red tape associated with getting any of that done just made it unrealistic.
[2319.48 → 2321.48] You know, it turns out to participate in a demolition derby.
[2321.48 → 2328.48] You are actually, for liability reasons, no matter what waiver you sign, not allowed to say,
[2328.48 → 2329.48] Yeah, no, it's cool.
[2329.48 → 2332.48] I'm not going to reinforce it or put a roll cage in at all.
[2332.48 → 2333.48] I'm just going to go for it.
[2333.48 → 2338.48] I'm going to pilot it with my Logitech 710 controller and whatever happens, happens.
[2345.48 → 2346.48] They will not let you do that.
[2346.48 → 2348.48] Yeah, that would have been really implosive.
[2348.48 → 2349.48] Yeah, so we ended up.
[2355.48 → 2366.48] So we ended up just taking it to like a recycler, and they presumably recycled it or, you know, took parts out of it that were needed for other 2003 Honda Civics.
[2366.48 → 2371.48] And hopefully its pieces are living a better life, living a better life somewhere.
[2371.48 → 2372.48] Alright, Dan, one more.
[2374.48 → 2375.48] Man, that was all just one merch message.
[2377.48 → 2380.48] What's the most difficult part of LTX to plan?
[2381.48 → 2382.48] I have no idea.
[2383.48 → 2384.48] All of it? Is it all of it?
[2384.48 → 2385.48] Colton, Steph?
[2385.48 → 2387.48] You know what? Actually, I have a pretty good guess.
[2387.48 → 2388.48] I'm going to see if I get it right.
[2388.48 → 2390.48] Okay, I'm going to write this down.
[2391.48 → 2394.48] Someone who plans LTX, get up here please, quickly.
[2394.48 → 2395.48] He's coming.
[2395.48 → 2396.48] Colton to the stage.
[2399.48 → 2400.48] Colton Potter, everybody.
[2400.48 → 2401.48] What's the question?
[2405.48 → 2406.48] Can you repeat the question?
[2406.48 → 2409.48] Yeah, the question is what's the most difficult part of LTX to plan?
[2409.48 → 2414.48] And Luke, Luke, I've written down my answer, and I'm not going to touch it.
[2414.48 → 2415.48] I'm not going to touch it.
[2415.48 → 2416.48] Okay.
[2416.48 → 2418.48] Apparently from today, it's line management and signage.
[2419.48 → 2420.48] But...
[2420.48 → 2421.48] Agree?
[2421.48 → 2422.48] What did you write down?
[2423.48 → 2424.48] What?
[2424.48 → 2425.48] What did you write down?
[2425.48 → 2426.48] So you wrote down something?
[2426.48 → 2429.48] Well, I didn't want to throw any of my fellow creators under the bus.
[2429.48 → 2435.48] But I think coordinating with online creators is just about the most difficult part of doing pretty much anything.
[2435.48 → 2436.48] Myself included.
[2436.48 → 2437.48] Yeah.
[2437.48 → 2439.48] Everybody's just got a busy schedule.
[2439.48 → 2441.48] It's hard to get a hold of people sometimes.
[2441.48 → 2442.48] It's perfect though.
[2442.48 → 2443.48] Shout out to all the creators that are here.
[2443.48 → 2444.48] Yeah.
[2444.48 → 2445.48] Thank you so much for being here.
[2445.48 → 2446.48] You're all awesome.
[2446.48 → 2447.48] Thank you.
[2447.48 → 2448.48] Thank you.
[2452.48 → 2453.48] All right.
[2453.48 → 2454.48] Why don't we jump into our next topic.
[2454.48 → 2456.48] Luke, you want to pick one, or should I pick one?
[2456.48 → 2457.48] Ooh.
[2457.48 → 2460.48] Should we go dystopian, or should we do something that's good news?
[2460.48 → 2461.48] I feel like we need something good.
[2461.48 → 2462.48] It's literally all the bad.
[2462.48 → 2463.48] There's nothing, Luke.
[2463.48 → 2468.48] How about the encrypted radios for vital infrastructure that have intentional back doors?
[2468.48 → 2469.48] Ooh.
[2469.48 → 2474.48] How about Tesla misrepresenting their battery range on purpose?
[2474.48 → 2475.48] Uh.
[2475.48 → 2476.48] Hmm.
[2476.48 → 2477.48] Okay.
[2477.48 → 2481.48] Can we take like mildly bad?
[2481.48 → 2482.48] Sure.
[2482.48 → 2483.48] Yeah.
[2483.48 → 2484.48] Which one is that?
[2484.48 → 2485.48] Online casinos targeting children then.
[2485.48 → 2486.48] Yeah.
[2486.48 → 2487.48] Sure.
[2487.48 → 2488.48] Why not?
[2488.48 → 2489.48] Uh.
[2489.48 → 2491.48] CSGO streamer, I don't know how to say this.
[2491.48 → 2492.48] Hoon Gunny.
[2492.48 → 2493.48] That.
[2493.48 → 2494.48] Uh.
[2494.48 → 2500.48] Did an exposé where he requested sponsorships from CSGO skin bedding sites and received offers
[2500.48 → 2504.48] worth up to 120,000 euros per month.
[2504.48 → 2505.48] Are you kidding me?
[2505.48 → 2506.48] Okay.
[2506.48 → 2507.48] Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2507.48 → 2508.48] Slow down for a second.
[2508.48 → 2509.48] Houghton Gain Sonny.
[2509.48 → 2514.48] Who has heard of Houghton Sonny?
[2514.48 → 2515.48] Anyone?
[2515.48 → 2518.48] I'm probably butchering it.
[2518.48 → 2519.48] H-O-U-N-G.
[2519.48 → 2520.48] We're being very mean.
[2520.48 → 2523.48] I'm sure you're doing great.
[2523.48 → 2524.48] Let's see.
[2524.48 → 2528.48] Well, you can't look on YouTube.
[2528.48 → 2529.48] Oh, they're doing great.
[2529.48 → 2530.48] Come on.
[2530.48 → 2531.48] Yeah.
[2531.48 → 2532.48] Okay.
[2532.48 → 2533.48] Okay.
[2533.48 → 2536.48] Maybe I just need to put this in context.
[2536.48 → 2544.48] For us at 14 million subscribers or whatever we're up to now, a sponsorship deal of 120,000
[2544.48 → 2547.48] euros a month would be huge.
[2547.48 → 2548.48] Massive.
[2548.48 → 2556.48] That would make that sponsor over the span of a year, one of our largest sponsors, if not our largest sponsor by dollars.
[2556.48 → 2558.48] Like that is enormous.
[2558.48 → 2565.48] Especially if we factor out, by the way, you know, shout out Asus DOG for sponsoring LTX this year.
[2565.48 → 2566.48] Okay.
[2566.48 → 2567.48] Okay.
[2567.48 → 2568.48] Okay.
[2568.48 → 2571.48] But that's separate.
[2571.48 → 2578.48] Hanganganyi, sorry, is not running a live convention or an expo.
[2578.48 → 2580.48] Like this is purely for online content.
[2580.48 → 2590.48] So if we were to take someone sponsoring just our content at that kind of rate, they would be one of, if not our biggest sponsor at our size.
[2590.48 → 2591.48] That is wild.
[2591.48 → 2592.48] Okay.
[2592.48 → 2597.48] And like, can I just say shout out because this is an amazing, amazing expose.
[2597.48 → 2598.48] Okay.
[2598.48 → 2599.48] So a perfect way to do it.
[2599.48 → 2605.48] So after he gets those offers, he then requests that they send him information about their licenses and operating practices.
[2605.48 → 2611.48] He concluded that most, if not all of these sites were not properly licensed as online casinos.
[2611.48 → 2620.48] And he also demonstrated how he could create a new Steam account and use it to gamble skins on an external site without ever having to verify his age.
[2620.48 → 2627.48] And while I would probably assume this was a joke as well, to be clear, he named the account, I'm 14, by the way.
[2627.48 → 2630.48] Kind of rough.
[2630.48 → 2639.48] He also requested a survey asking, sorry, he also released a survey asking players about their CSGO gambling habits, collecting over 9,000 responses.
[2639.48 → 2645.48] Over 70% reported that they had started gambling with skins prior to the age of 18.
[2645.48 → 2647.48] At least one was only 12.
[2647.48 → 2654.48] Many met the definition for problem gambling, where their addiction is damaging to them, their family, and their day-to-day life.
[2654.48 → 2663.48] The majority, around three-fourths of top CSGO streamers on Twitch, are taking sponsorships from at least one of these various gambling websites.
[2663.48 → 2667.48] CSGO is not the only game where miners get addicted to gambling.
[2667.48 → 2680.48] Journalist Cody Long, who covers e-sports and betting, has reported that there are a handful of black market casino sites targeting miners aged 16 and younger through Roblox, which we've actually covered on the show before.
[2680.48 → 2686.48] Can we just talk about how, okay, this is kind of a funny one for me.
[2686.48 → 2696.48] Because growing up as a kid, it was always kind of baffling to me that it was illegal to play poker in some places.
[2696.48 → 2703.48] Here in North America, you actually technically were not allowed to get together with your friends and have a poker night and bet real money.
[2703.48 → 2709.48] And like, you know, if one of your buddies was a cop, it was like, oh, yeah, better not invite them.
[2709.48 → 2713.48] Like that was always bizarre to me.
[2713.48 → 2724.48] I don't, I'm so tight-fisted that the idea of betting anything other than what I could give away without caring at all whatsoever is sort of foreign to me.
[2724.48 → 2734.48] So the idea of developing a gambling problem where I was losing significant amounts of my money or going into debt was something that I didn't really understand at the time.
[2734.48 → 2736.48] I was very young, right?
[2736.48 → 2743.48] But can I just, can I just ask how the pendulum, because I still don't think that's a big deal.
[2743.48 → 2749.48] Like if everyone's got, if you've got like a $10 buy-in or whatever, you want to get together, eat some chips and dip and play card games.
[2749.48 → 2753.48] What business is it of anyone else's from my personal perspective?
[2753.48 → 2756.48] I'm sure this is going to blow up on Reddit or whatever, but...
[2756.48 → 2757.48] Spins out of control quickly.
[2757.48 → 2763.48] Yeah, I just, I don't think it's that big of a deal as long as everybody has a bit of self-restraint, right?
[2763.48 → 2773.48] How did we go from that to half of the commercials during a sports ball game being for just betting on every single aspect of it?
[2773.48 → 2776.48] How many times is the quarterback going to pick his ass?
[2776.48 → 2780.48] Like it wouldn't, it wouldn't surprise me if you could bet on that stuff.
[2780.48 → 2781.48] Yeah.
[2781.48 → 2783.48] I don't know how you'd measure it.
[2783.48 → 2784.48] It's so high.
[2784.48 → 2786.48] They're constantly in there.
[2786.48 → 2787.48] I mean, they got those tight pants.
[2787.48 → 2788.48] I don't blame them.
[2788.48 → 2789.48] Yeah.
[2789.48 → 2795.48] I don't have, have you ever bet on anything like that?
[2795.48 → 2796.48] Have I ever?
[2796.48 → 2797.48] Yeah.
[2797.48 → 2798.48] Have you, have you played in a casino?
[2798.48 → 2799.48] Yeah.
[2799.48 → 2800.48] Stuff like that.
[2800.48 → 2801.48] Yeah.
[2801.48 → 2802.48] Yeah.
[2802.48 → 2803.48] Yeah.
[2803.48 → 2807.48] So after, after over 10 years of travelling to Vegas every year for conventions, Yvonne and
[2807.48 → 2816.48] I finally went together once for a CES, and we bought like, I think a hundred bucks in chips or something like that.
[2816.48 → 2822.48] And we lost it in about 10 minutes at a blackjack table.
[2822.48 → 2826.48] And we're like, well, bucket list complete.
[2826.48 → 2827.48] That was lame.
[2827.48 → 2830.48] I no longer feel the need to ever do that again.
[2830.48 → 2839.48] Um, one time when I was like 16, I was travelling back from Arizona, and I was by myself in the Las Vegas airport, and they have those slot machines all throughout the thing.
[2839.48 → 2841.48] And I had a little bit of money, not that much.
[2841.48 → 2846.48] So I took like 25 cents, I put it into a slot machine, immediately lost it and was like, yeah, that's stupid.
[2846.48 → 2848.48] And went and bought like a gaming magazine or something.
[2848.48 → 2851.48] I was like, this was a much better investment.
[2851.48 → 2852.48] To be clear.
[2852.48 → 2862.48] One of the things, one of the aspects of gambling that I do understand why people get into is betting on games, betting on, betting on professionals.
[2862.48 → 2866.48] It makes you more invested when you're watching, makes it more tense, a little bit more interesting.
[2866.48 → 2868.48] I, uh, you know, I still would never do it.
[2868.48 → 2871.48] I used to love watching hockey.
[2871.48 → 2879.48] Um, but before one, uh, I forget if it was the last one or the one before there was some kind of tussle between the millionaires and the billionaires.
[2879.48 → 2884.48] And I was just like, this is, this is very commercial.
[2884.48 → 2885.48] Happens in hockey a lot.
[2885.48 → 2886.48] Yeah.
[2886.48 → 2887.48] Yeah.
[2887.48 → 2888.48] It seems to happen a lot.
[2888.48 → 2891.48] And, you know, I, I, I'm, to be clear, I'm not blaming the players.
[2891.48 → 2895.48] You know if the, if the ticket sales and the merch sales are coming in, they should get their piece.
[2895.48 → 2896.48] Absolutely.
[2896.48 → 2907.48] And I'm just saying that it, it really made me, instead of just sitting and watching hockey, it made me reflect on the business of what I was watching and how much of it is just a product.
[2907.48 → 2913.48] And it, it gave me time to sort of think about the way that the athletes, even though we, we put them on these pedestals, and we look up to them.
[2913.48 → 2915.48] And, and, you know, as kids, they're our heroes.
[2915.48 → 2919.48] We have posters of them on our walls, the way that they're actually just kind of treated like livestock.
[2919.48 → 2920.48] Yeah.
[2920.48 → 2925.48] You know, like, no, but really, you know, what, what, what they, they're prone to like leg issues.
[2925.48 → 2929.48] So I, I want to take them out behind the barn and see you later, buddy.
[2929.48 → 2930.48] Right? Like, I don't know.
[2930.48 → 2937.48] I just, I, I started to find a lot of it really kind of uncomfortable for me.
[2937.48 → 2952.48] But what I will say is that one of the when I was following the sport very, very actively, it wasn't so much that I cared about the Vancouver team winning because realistically there was nobody on the roster that was from Vancouver or probably even wanted to be here.
[2952.48 → 2954.48] And they weren't going to win anyway.
[2954.48 → 2956.48] And the, well, no, no, no, no, no. This was when they were good.
[2956.48 → 2957.48] Oh, okay.
[2957.48 → 2964.48] Yeah. So, yeah. So, so it's not like I'm rooting for my Vancouver team, but you, you know, you get to know the, the, the characters, you develop these like par asocial relationships.
[2964.48 → 2965.48] I'm sure you guys can't relate.
[2965.48 → 2970.48] Um, and you, you feel like, you know, them, you, you, you want to root for them, right?
[2970.48 → 2975.48] You want them to succeed. You want them to lift the cup or, or whatever it is. Right.
[2975.48 → 2984.48] And, and, and so what I, what I kind of realized, you know, looking back at how invested I was, like, I, I had stopped by the, you know,
[2984.48 → 2989.48] biting my nails for years until I started watching hockey religiously again.
[2989.48 → 2994.48] And I realized all of my nails were bitten down to dubbins because they'd be behind by one in the third period or whatever.
[2994.48 → 3009.48] Wow. Yeah. And, um, and so I can see how people could get kind of hooked on the thrill of having, you know, not just their hometown team where they know all the personalities or, you know, they, you love the logo.
[3009.48 → 3015.48] Yeah. People will follow sports teams for any number of different reasons or because they are in the city where they can go and watch them live or whatever the case may be.
[3015.48 → 3017.48] Their primary colours really go with my skin.
[3017.48 → 3026.48] But people being able to amp that up and, you know, have the, the thrill of, of winning real money. And, you know, I, I can see how you can.
[3026.48 → 3028.48] Having an actual stake in the game.
[3028.48 → 3031.48] Exactly. I, I, I can see how that could be extremely addictive.
[3031.48 → 3035.48] We're really making an advertisement for, for sports gambling.
[3035.48 → 3047.48] Well, but, but what I'm saying is I do find it upsetting that we have gotten to the point where it's gotten very, I feel like mobile gaming started this man.
[3047.48 → 3050.48] It's, it's gotten very predatory.
[3050.48 → 3053.48] Like they're going after the whales hard.
[3053.48 → 3058.48] Hey, look.
[3058.48 → 3060.48] Hi whale team.
[3060.48 → 3063.48] Hey, we try to provide value for the whales.
[3063.48 → 3065.48] They got a computer.
[3065.48 → 3068.48] They got the hotel and all that, all that good stuff.
[3068.48 → 3070.48] There's value. There's value in that ticket.
[3070.48 → 3074.48] We're not just, we're not just taking your money and giving you back like some pixels, right?
[3074.48 → 3079.48] Or, or, or a chance to, to, to have something.
[3079.48 → 3083.48] I guess our, I don't know our, oh wow.
[3083.48 → 3084.48] Seriously.
[3084.48 → 3087.48] We didn't even get to the worst part, Luke.
[3087.48 → 3094.48] These, these Roblox or Roux casinos can, you can, oh wow.
[3094.48 → 3097.48] They can, you can cash them out for real currency.
[3097.48 → 3108.48] Meaning that millions of dollars are being gambled in these online casinos and Blowflies, one of the largest of these sites is paying teenage Roblox influencers for promotions.
[3108.48 → 3110.48] Oh, I guarantee you it's for money laundering.
[3110.48 → 3111.48] They're often gone.
[3111.48 → 3113.48] I promise you.
[3113.48 → 3124.48] Creators as young as 14 have claimed to have received emails from Blowflies offering sponsorships, including kickbacks for the wagers that are placed by referred players.
[3124.48 → 3127.48] Oh good. Now it's a pyramid scheme too.
[3127.48 → 3128.48] Yay.
[3132.48 → 3139.48] Roblox has stated that it will be taking actions on these sites, but didn't exactly specify.
[3139.48 → 3141.48] Hasn't Roblox said that kind of thing before?
[3141.48 → 3142.48] I'm pretty sure.
[3142.48 → 3149.48] I mean, as long as we just count on these platforms to self-police, I just don't think we're ever going to see any kind of meaningful change.
[3149.48 → 3151.48] Because they benefit from it.
[3151.48 → 3157.48] Even if they aren't taking a little bit off the top of every transaction, they benefit from the popularity of the game.
[3157.48 → 3158.48] And that comes from-
[3158.48 → 3159.48] Well, it's Roblox transactions.
[3159.48 → 3160.48] So their money has to be involved.
[3160.48 → 3161.48] So they are taking a bit.
[3161.48 → 3167.48] But even if they weren't though, they still benefit from people just being invested in this platform.
[3167.48 → 3171.48] Okay, can we please find something that's good news?
[3171.48 → 3172.48] What about sponsors?
[3172.48 → 3175.48] Oh, oh, oh, here's something good.
[3175.48 → 3178.48] We have a motherboard house of cards announcement.
[3178.48 → 3181.48] Congrats to Caleb M from Idaho.
[3181.48 → 3187.48] His house of cards had an outstanding length of 185 centimetres.
[3187.48 → 3189.48] You have won an DOG Strip motherboard.
[3189.48 → 3192.48] I have absolutely no idea whatsoever how you claim your prize.
[3192.48 → 3194.48] Give me the motherboard.
[3194.48 → 3195.48] Where's Sean?
[3195.48 → 3196.48] Is it here?
[3196.48 → 3197.48] Okay, cool.
[3197.48 → 3198.48] We'll deal with that in a second.
[3198.48 → 3200.48] Why don't we talk-you know what?
[3200.48 → 3202.48] Why don't we talk about Twitter rebranding as X?
[3202.48 → 3205.48] People in Float plane Chat are saying that we should have Float plane Gambling,
[3205.48 → 3208.48] where you can gamble on what's going to happen in WAN Show.
[3212.48 → 3213.48] Wait.
[3213.48 → 3216.48] This is actually a perfect idea.
[3216.48 → 3217.48] Okay.
[3217.48 → 3218.48] Float bucks.
[3219.48 → 3221.48] We basically-
[3221.48 → 3222.48] We–we stack-
[3222.48 → 3223.48] Oh, we rig it!
[3223.48 → 3224.48] Yeah!
[3224.48 → 3225.48] Yeah, of course.
[3225.48 → 3226.48] We stack the deck.
[3226.48 → 3227.48] Money!
[3227.48 → 3228.48] So, we've been-
[3228.48 → 3229.48] Yes.
[3229.48 → 3230.48] Huh.
[3230.48 → 3231.48] I wish you guys weren't all hearing this.
[3231.48 → 3234.48] We've actually been doing this for years.
[3234.48 → 3235.48] Okay?
[3235.48 → 3241.48] Every time the WAN Show is late, we're conditioning you guys to think the WAN Show is always late.
[3241.48 → 3246.48] Then, we introduce the ability to bet on whether the WAN Show is on time or late.
[3246.48 → 3249.48] We bet on the WAN Show being on time!
[3249.48 → 3252.48] And then we lose all of our money anyway because we couldn't start the WAN Show on time to save our lives.
[3252.48 → 3253.48] It still happened late.
[3253.48 → 3254.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3254.48 → 3259.48] Did we get the motherboard?
[3259.48 → 3260.48] Uh-
[3260.48 → 3261.48] Did we get the motherboard?
[3261.48 → 3262.48] Uh-
[3262.48 → 3265.48] He's furiously typing, which I think means no.
[3265.48 → 3268.48] Twitter has officially begun rebranding itself as X.
[3268.48 → 3269.48] Hilarious.
[3269.48 → 3279.48] The letter X in the new logo is the Monotype Special Alphabets 4 font, which also looks similar to a standard character added to Unicode in 2001.
[3279.48 → 3280.48] Sure does.
[3280.48 → 3281.48] The new brand...
[3281.48 → 3286.48] The second I saw the logo, I was like, wait, I've seen this before.
[3286.48 → 3295.48] Okay, I'm just going to keep talking through the discussion question, but like, the new branding has been criticized for being awkward to integrate into normal speech.
[3295.48 → 3296.48] Okay?
[3296.48 → 3301.48] It's also been criticized for its similarity to those of pornographic websites.
[3301.48 → 3309.48] On Monday, a worker on a cherry picker began dismantling the sign on X's San Francisco headquarters.
[3309.48 → 3315.48] However, it appears they failed to inform the building's owner of the change, who called the police.
[3315.48 → 3320.48] This left the sign simply reading, er...
[3320.48 → 3322.48] Highly applicable.
[3322.48 → 3333.48] Initially, X was unable to use the at X handle, because it had been in use by photographer Gene X Huang since 2007.
[3333.48 → 3346.48] And then as of Thursday, they just took the handle, offering Huang some merch, and the ability to meet with their management team once as compensation.
[3346.48 → 3351.48] Huang declined any meeting, feeling that it would be awkward.
[3351.48 → 3357.48] I feel like this has kind of been beaten to death over the past week, but...
[3357.48 → 3358.48] Yeah.
[3358.48 → 3363.48] Do you have any thoughts that you feel are kind of unique? Is there anything that you feel that there is...
[3363.48 → 3366.48] Oh, no, I just think it's hilarious. I don't care at all. I just think it's hilarious.
[3366.48 → 3379.48] They took literally, literally, one of probably, I don't know, top 10, top 5, with how much it's talked about in the news and stuff, most recognizable brands, and just yeeted it.
[3379.48 → 3383.48] For, like, no reason at all.
[3383.48 → 3389.48] And, like, he's talked about how he wants to make X.com a thing, he wants to have the X app, he wants to do this AI stuff.
[3389.48 → 3393.48] Why wasn't it just something else? Why was it the same platform?
[3393.48 → 3397.48] You bought, effectively, a name. They were super negative. The tech wasn't all that special.
[3397.48 → 3405.48] You bought a name, and then got rid of the name, which is the funniest possible thing he could have done, in my opinion.
[3405.48 → 3410.48] I think this is hilarious. When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. I thought it was like an Onion article.
[3410.48 → 3417.48] And then my actual app actually updated, and I was like, no way! This is real!
[3417.48 → 3420.48] And now I just use it even less, which is great.
[3420.48 → 3427.48] Honestly, over the last few weeks, the like, relatively few amount of people that I need to use Twitter for to interact with through DMs,
[3427.48 → 3429.48] kind of just going off of Twitter.
[3429.48 → 3430.48] Yeah.
[3430.48 → 3433.48] So the amount that I need to use it just keeps going down.
[3433.48 → 3438.48] Can we talk about the intention of turning it into an app?
[3438.48 → 3440.48] That's worked many times in the past.
[3440.48 → 3446.48] Yeah, so, I mean, it's sort of, it's sort of not the stupidest vision ever.
[3446.48 → 3447.48] Sure.
[3447.48 → 3450.48] You know, people using it for payments, using it for communicating with each other.
[3450.48 → 3456.48] And while I've said that sarcastically, is WeChat not effectively that in China?
[3456.48 → 3457.48] Yeah, pretty much.
[3457.48 → 3458.48] It's sort of an app, right?
[3458.48 → 3461.48] Yeah, pretty much. It's kind of like an app.
[3461.48 → 3467.48] It's, you use it to communicate with people, you use it to get news, you use it to pay for groceries,
[3467.48 → 3472.48] you use it to make sure that Big Brother can keep track of your social credit score, all that good stuff.
[3472.48 → 3473.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3473.48 → 3475.48] It's everything. Cool.
[3475.48 → 3482.48] But the problem, the problem with this is that X isn't even a good name for that.
[3482.48 → 3483.48] Yeah.
[3483.48 → 3489.48] It, it, it feels like a placeholder because it objectively is a placeholder.
[3489.48 → 3492.48] I don't know.
[3492.48 → 3496.48] Project, Project X will come up with a name for it later.
[3496.48 → 3504.48] Nobody ever actually launches Project X, except Microsoft, who I think we can all agree that other than Elon Musk,
[3504.48 → 3508.48] is the one entity worse at naming anything.
[3509.48 → 3510.48] Really?
[3510.48 → 3511.48] Especially in relation to Xbox.
[3511.48 → 3513.48] Xbox 360.
[3513.48 → 3515.48] That was okay.
[3515.48 → 3516.48] One.
[3516.48 → 3517.48] That was bad.
[3517.48 → 3518.48] Series.
[3518.48 → 3519.48] That was worse.
[3519.48 → 3522.48] It went downhill fast.
[3522.48 → 3524.48] I thought 360 was okay.
[3524.48 → 3526.48] I just thought the progression would also make sense.
[3526.48 → 3529.48] They started with X, and then they actually managed to get worse.
[3529.48 → 3531.48] So where is Twitter headed from here?
[3531.48 → 3537.48] I also think X as like a thing that people say used to kind of be a thing.
[3537.48 → 3539.48] X factor, X marks the spot.
[3539.48 → 3547.48] Like there was, it was actually a thing that people used, and now it's like not, and now we have to use it again, but for the worst reason.
[3547.48 → 3548.48] Yeah.
[3548.48 → 3560.48] I mean, is this really as simple as he's just still butt hurt over the whole, you know, PayPal originally being X.com,
[3560.48 → 3564.48] and then it like became PayPal, and then he ended up like ousted or whatever it was.
[3564.48 → 3571.48] Like I know there's some bad blood between him and PayPal, and then he is like, for sentimental reasons, bought X.com from them,
[3571.48 → 3573.48] like ages, ages later.
[3573.48 → 3592.48] Like is this really going all the way back to when my former employer, Net link Computer Incorporated, changed their website name from PC97.com in 1999 to NCIX.com, Net link Computer Incorporated.
[3592.48 → 3593.48] X.
[3593.48 → 3595.48] X, because X is cool.
[3595.48 → 3596.48] Yeah.
[3596.48 → 3598.48] Like that's kind of gone now.
[3598.48 → 3601.48] It's been gone for 15, 20 years, Luke.
[3601.48 → 3602.48] Yeah.
[3602.48 → 3603.48] Yeah.
[3603.48 → 3605.48] About when he got the domain in the first place.
[3605.48 → 3606.48] Yeah, yeah.
[3606.48 → 3612.48] This is the so we're really just going back 20 years, and I'm supposed to trust this platform to find out what's hip and cool.
[3612.48 → 3615.48] Oh, I don't trust it for anything, which is why I just think it's funny.
[3615.48 → 3616.48] I don't know.
[3616.48 → 3617.48] Okay.
[3617.48 → 3618.48] No.
[3618.48 → 3619.48] No.
[3619.48 → 3620.48] No.
[3620.48 → 3621.48] No.
[3621.48 → 3622.48] No.
[3622.48 → 3623.48] No.
[3623.48 → 3624.48] No.
[3624.48 → 3632.48] Because, because if it was LTE, that would have been very confusing.
[3632.48 → 3637.48] Linus Tech Expo spelled correctly would have caused all kinds of problems.
[3637.48 → 3642.48] There's also precedent set from PAX, Penny Arcade Expo, X being Expo.
[3642.48 → 3643.48] Yeah.
[3643.48 → 3644.48] We were followers.
[3644.48 → 3645.48] Yeah.
[3645.48 → 3649.48] We weren't trying to like boldly name things X.
[3649.48 → 3650.48] Dot com.
[3650.48 → 3654.48] And we have a history of naming things pretty stupid things too.
[3654.48 → 3655.48] Channel super fun.
[3655.48 → 3656.48] Channel super fun.
[3656.48 → 3659.48] It was super fun, and it was a channel, okay?
[3659.48 → 3660.48] Whatever.
[3660.48 → 3662.48] Tech quickie is just a sex joke.
[3662.48 → 3666.48] So as fast as possible, which is on Tech quickie I guess.
[3666.48 → 3667.48] Yeah.
[3667.48 → 3668.48] Yeah.
[3668.48 → 3672.48] Go ahead.
[3672.48 → 3674.48] What does it abbreviate to?
[3674.48 → 3675.48] Printers.
[3675.48 → 3676.48] Uh.
[3676.48 → 3678.48] Fast as possible?
[3678.48 → 3679.48] No it doesn't.
[3679.48 → 3680.48] It's a joke.
[3680.48 → 3681.48] Oh, I get it.
[3681.48 → 3684.48] We got there.
[3684.48 → 3685.48] Yeah.
[3685.48 → 3686.48] Good joke.
[3686.48 → 3690.48] Just like this joke segue to our sponsor.
[3690.48 → 3692.48] Do you want to give away the motherboard first?
[3692.48 → 3694.48] Oh yeah, I want to give away the motherboard first.
[3694.48 → 3695.48] Yeah.
[3695.48 → 3696.48] Yeah.
[3696.48 → 3697.48] Yeah.
[3697.48 → 3698.48] Yeah.
[3698.48 → 3699.48] So Caleb M from Idaho, are you here?
[3699.48 → 3700.48] I think he is.
[3700.48 → 3701.48] Do you want to come up on stage?
[3701.48 → 3702.48] Okay.
[3702.48 → 3704.48] We'll just head up here and queue up by Dan at your leisure.
[3704.48 → 3705.48] And let's get to our sponsor spots.
[3705.48 → 3706.48] John.
[3706.48 → 3707.48] John.
[3707.48 → 3708.48] Hit me Dan.
[3708.48 → 3709.48] John.
[3709.48 → 3710.48] What do you want a sponsor spot?
[3710.48 → 3711.48] Yeah, I want a sponsor spot.
[3711.48 → 3713.48] Technically it has to be them, right?
[3713.48 → 3715.48] Don't you have the sponsor spots?
[3715.48 → 3717.48] Oh, is it just, it's not Dennis Reeds?
[3717.48 → 3718.48] No, no, no.
[3718.48 → 3719.48] It's special.
[3719.48 → 3720.48] They come up there.
[3720.48 → 3721.48] Oh, it's special.
[3721.48 → 3722.48] Oh.
[3722.48 → 3723.48] I don't have to do anything now.
[3723.48 → 3724.48] This is great.
[3724.48 → 3726.48] I am actually really confused by this one.
[3726.48 → 3730.48] This is the first time we've ever worked with whatever this is.
[3730.48 → 3734.48] I had to read it out from over there because I don't actually have a preview on my screen.
[3734.48 → 3737.48] Our first sponsor is I am Tim Corey.
[3737.48 → 3738.48] I understand it.
[3738.48 → 3740.48] Speaking of being terrible at names.
[3740.48 → 3741.48] Yeah.
[3741.48 → 3742.48] I'm Linus.
[3742.48 → 3743.48] Nice to meet you, Tim.
[3743.48 → 3745.48] It is really straightforward.
[3745.48 → 3746.48] You know exactly who he is.
[3746.48 → 3749.48] My talking points say I'm not drunk.
[3749.48 → 3752.48] This company is literally called I am Tim Corey.
[3752.48 → 3753.48] Oh.
[3753.48 → 3754.48] No, he was drunk.
[3754.48 → 3755.48] Oh.
[3755.48 → 3756.48] Not now.
[3756.48 → 3759.48] Not now, but when he named his company.
[3759.48 → 3764.48] Anyway, Tim Corey is a professional developer who has over a quarter million students around
[3764.48 → 3765.48] the world.
[3765.48 → 3766.48] Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[3766.48 → 3767.48] It's actually just Tim Corey.
[3767.48 → 3768.48] Yeah, it makes sense.
[3768.48 → 3769.48] Okay.
[3769.48 → 3772.48] His company, I am Tim Corey, offers an easier way to become a developer with their comprehensive
[3772.48 → 3776.48] online courses such as the C Sharp Master Course.
[3776.48 → 3781.48] Getting a computer science degree can be expensive, can also be unnecessary.
[3781.48 → 3782.48] All right.
[3782.48 → 3783.48] That's what Tim said.
[3783.48 → 3786.48] I'm not taking a stance on that anyway.
[3786.48 → 3792.48] And this 70 hour program takes you beyond a degree or bootcamp, preparing you for real-world
[3792.48 → 3793.48] coding.
[3793.48 → 3798.48] The course covers C Sharp, syntax, advanced breakpoints, entity framework, and more.
[3798.48 → 3800.48] And Tim offers a money-back guarantee.
[3800.48 → 3805.48] If the course isn't for you, you can count on a no-hassle 30-day money-back guarantee.
[3805.48 → 3810.48] So check out Tim Corey's C Sharp Master Course at the link below and get an exclusive discount.
[3810.48 → 3815.48] Can I just say, whether this is Tim or my team, I am extremely offended that every time we have
[3815.48 → 3821.48] C and a hash sign, it has a pronunciation key in parentheses, C and the word sharp.
[3821.48 → 3822.48] It totally did.
[3822.48 → 3825.48] I knew that.
[3825.48 → 3828.48] I wouldn't have said C pound.
[3828.48 → 3832.48] C number sign.
[3832.48 → 3835.48] The show is also brought to you by Squarespace.

[3900.48 → 3902.48] And I believe I have something special to do.
[3902.48 → 3903.48] Oh, look.
[3903.48 → 3904.48] That's right.
[3904.48 → 3909.48] It's Jessica, who have we ever actually formally introduced as the writer for the WAN show?
[3909.48 → 3910.48] Never.
[3910.48 → 3911.48] Go, Jessica!
[3911.48 → 3912.48] Come here.
[3912.48 → 3913.48] Come here.
[3913.48 → 3914.48] Come here.
[3914.48 → 3915.48] Come here.
[3915.48 → 3916.48] Oh.
[3916.48 → 3917.48] Hi.
[3917.48 → 3926.48] I accidentally kind of did while she was still on her 90-day probationary period.
[3926.48 → 3930.48] And then I got so afraid of ever doing it again that I've just never said her name again.
[3930.48 → 3934.48] We can't actually, guys, could we put the ridge thing away for one second?
[3934.48 → 3935.48] Gotta like restart it after.
[3935.48 → 3936.48] Yeah.
[3936.48 → 3937.48] There we go.
[3937.48 → 3938.48] There's Jessica.
[3938.48 → 3939.48] Say hi, Jessica.
[3939.48 → 3940.48] Hi, Jessica.
[3940.48 → 3941.48] Oh.
[3941.48 → 3942.48] Okay.
[3942.48 → 3943.48] Get, get, get, get.
[3943.48 → 3944.48] Thank you very much.
[3944.48 → 3945.48] I have one.
[3945.48 → 3946.48] All right.
[3946.48 → 3948.48] So we've got something pretty special.
[3948.48 → 3951.48] Some people say thicker is better.
[3951.48 → 3952.48] Better.
[3952.48 → 3953.48] I disagree.
[3953.48 → 3954.48] I disagree.
[3954.48 → 3957.48] Not everyone agrees.
[3957.48 → 3960.48] And the ridge does not agree.
[3960.48 → 3961.48] Oh, wait.
[3961.48 → 3962.48] Oh, yes.
[3962.48 → 3963.48] Okay.
[3963.48 → 3965.48] We're not talking about the thing I thought we were talking about.
[3965.48 → 3966.48] We're talking about wallet size.
[3966.48 → 3967.48] Okay.
[3967.48 → 3968.48] I'm no longer offended.
[3968.48 → 3972.48] The ridge has redefined the traditional wallet with its compact and stylish designs.
[3972.48 → 3981.48] And today on the show floor, I get to show you guys and I get to give away 20 limited edition,
[3981.48 → 3983.48] LTX edition Ridge wallets.
[3983.48 → 3986.48] Thanks to our sponsor, the ridge.
[3986.48 → 3997.48] So what I am asking for is if you think you have one of the chunkiest grossest wallets in the entire audience.
[3997.48 → 4011.48] I would like you to line up next to producer Dan, who will give you a yes, no, no, yes, no, yes, no, and send you up for one of these exclusive LTX 2023 Ridge wallets.
[4011.48 → 4012.48] This is absolutely fantastic.
[4012.48 → 4015.48] It's got their classic RFID blocking plates.
[4015.48 → 4019.48] They're strong elastic to keep all your cards in place.
[4019.48 → 4020.48] Oh, my goodness.
[4020.48 → 4022.48] There are so many of you coming up here.
[4022.48 → 4023.48] What's up?
[4023.48 → 4024.48] Can I flip over?
[4024.48 → 4025.48] Yeah, they're all serialized.
[4025.48 → 4027.48] Oh, they're numbered too.
[4027.48 → 4030.48] So there's 20 of them, and it tells you which one that you have.
[4030.48 → 4032.48] Absolutely incredible.
[4032.48 → 4034.48] That is way more than 20 people.
[4034.48 → 4040.48] If you are still coming up, I would strongly recommend just making your way back to your seat because we actually only have 20 of them.
[4040.48 → 4045.48] Producer Dan, I leave it to your impeccable judgment to determine who gets one.
[4045.48 → 4046.48] Oh, you missed one.
[4046.48 → 4047.48] Wait, Dan.
[4047.48 → 4048.48] The 20th.
[4050.48 → 4051.48] Thanks, Dan.
[4051.48 → 4052.48] All right.
[4052.48 → 4058.48] Hey, thanks for being here live, and thanks to The Ridge for sponsoring LT something.
[4058.48 → 4059.48] WAN Show.
[4059.48 → 4060.48] That's the one.
[4060.48 → 4061.48] Yeah.
[4061.48 → 4062.48] They sponsor all kinds of things.
[4062.48 → 4063.48] Yeah.
[4063.48 → 4070.48] If you guys want to get a different Ridge wallet, you can head over to the link in the video description where you can save 10% and get free shipping.
[4070.48 → 4073.48] They've got over 30 colour and style variations.
[4073.48 → 4075.48] Freaking awesome.
[4075.48 → 4082.48] Now, I don't think we have an LTT store or deal of the week or anything like that.
[4082.48 → 4084.48] Can we find some good news?
[4084.48 → 4089.48] Do you want to talk about Sam Altman's Worldcoin?
[4089.48 → 4091.48] Yeah, because it's hilarious.
[4091.48 → 4093.48] At least it's funny.
[4093.48 → 4094.48] Okay.
[4094.48 → 4096.48] You know, at least we can laugh at some of the bad.
[4096.48 → 4097.48] Okay.
[4097.48 → 4103.48] Sam Altman, best known for his involvement in OpenAI, has launched Worldcoin.
[4103.48 → 4116.48] And honestly, we didn't have this as one of our prepared topics mostly because we don't really need it because all we really have to do is read the introduction on worldcoin.org.
[4116.48 → 4119.48] And I feel like you guys are going to be laughing alongside us.
[4119.48 → 4128.48] More than three years ago, we founded Worldcoin with the ambition of creating a new identity and financial network that's owned by everyone.
[4128.48 → 4130.48] The rollout begins today.
[4130.48 → 4131.48] Yes.
[4131.48 → 4138.48] Can I just say that that is either the most benevolent or the most ominous thing that I have ever heard.
[4138.48 → 4157.48] If successful, we believe Worldcoin, what a terrifying name, could drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy, enable global democratic processes.
[4157.48 → 4167.48] My goodness, what an ambitious goal, and eventually show a potential path to AI funded universal basic income.
[4167.48 → 4169.48] Where did that come from?
[4169.48 → 4172.48] This is some next level crypto bro right here.
[4172.48 → 4175.48] This will solve all the problems.
[4175.48 → 4177.48] You can even eat it.
[4177.48 → 4187.48] Worldcoin consists of a privacy preserving digital identity, world ID, and where laws allow a digital currency.
[4187.48 → 4188.48] Okay, I knew it.
[4188.48 → 4190.48] I knew the crypto was coming.
[4190.48 → 4191.48] It's got to be crypto.
[4191.48 → 4192.48] OLD.
[4192.48 → 4198.48] And it is received simply for being human.
[4198.48 → 4199.48] We're all rich.
[4199.48 → 4200.48] We're all rich.
[4200.48 → 4201.48] Let's go.
[4201.48 → 4211.48] We hope that where the rules are less clear, such as in the US, steps will be taken so more people can benefit from both of these things.
[4211.48 → 4217.48] You can now download World App, the first protocol compatible-
[4217.48 → 4218.48] Hey, names are hard.
[4218.48 → 4220.48] We just talked about this.
[4220.48 → 4223.48] And reserve your share.
[4223.48 → 4228.48] After visiting an orb, a biometric verification device-
[4228.48 → 4230.48] Which also doesn't sound ominous at all.
[4230.48 → 4232.48] You will receive a World ID.
[4232.48 → 4242.48] This lets you prove you are a real and unique person online while remaining completely private.
[4242.48 → 4250.48] As the global distribution of orbs is ramping up, you can find the closest one and book a time to be verified with World App at worldcoin.org.
[4250.48 → 4254.48] Press your face against the orb so we can know you're human and enable you to survive.
[4254.48 → 4257.48] Luke, have you seen the pictures of the orb?
[4257.48 → 4259.48] Oh yeah, it's amazing.
[4259.48 → 4264.48] Okay, so just put your eye into this thing.
[4264.48 → 4287.48] Okay, and then will for real, this is all completely secure, definitely take your indelible world identity and make sure that no one can impersonate you or think that you are not a real human being.
[4287.48 → 4290.48] Yeah, it'll be fine.
[4290.48 → 4292.48] Like to be clear.
[4292.48 → 4294.48] You know what?
[4294.48 → 4297.48] Someone in the audience was like, trust me bro.
[4297.48 → 4299.48] Well, I know, right?
[4299.48 → 4303.48] What if they did it?
[4303.48 → 4308.48] What if OpenAI and Worldcoin both adopted trust me bro?
[4308.48 → 4310.48] Would you try to trademark it?
[4310.48 → 4312.48] I would stop using it.
[4313.48 → 4321.48] I don't think I want to be associated with technologies that are going to be completely obsoleting our functions as humans over the next, you know, three to ten years.
[4321.48 → 4326.48] Though, with that said actually, this seems like a good transition into our next topic.
[4326.48 → 4334.48] Has anyone else noticed that ChatGPT is getting like measurably, noticeably worse as time goes on?
[4334.48 → 4336.48] I don't think this is actually in the doc.
[4336.48 → 4337.48] No, it's not.
[4337.48 → 4338.48] But we can talk about this as well.
[4338.48 → 4344.48] I've read a lot of documentation about how ChatGPT 4 specifically is getting worse over time.
[4344.48 → 4350.48] I also know, especially on our team, Conrad, who's actually behind the stage right now, making sure that Merch Messages keeps functioning.
[4350.48 → 4354.48] But he has mentioned multiple times about how ChatGPT 4 has gotten worse.
[4354.48 → 4361.48] And there's a lot of people talking about how they believe the more it interacts with humans, the worse it gets.
[4361.48 → 4366.48] Which is kind of hilarious and also really sad at the same time.
[4366.48 → 4370.48] But, yeah, it's interesting.
[4370.48 → 4376.48] In that same talk, we're watching ChatGPT 4 get worse through various different ways.
[4376.48 → 4382.48] We're also seeing restrictions coming to the major platforms like OpenAI.
[4382.48 → 4390.48] Like they're figuring out, oh, they used some things in training that the companies that had that data in the first place are not very happy about.
[4390.48 → 4396.48] Or they're outputting answers that are an issue for some reason.
[4396.48 → 4407.48] Whether it's due to social pressure or whether it's just due to the flawed dataset that they were using, making some really alarming assumptions.
[4407.48 → 4413.48] Well, they're also making claims about people that don't end up being true, but they're using their name in the statements and stuff.
[4413.48 → 4417.48] And then OpenAI is trying to wrangle that in, but then there are problems with that.
[4417.48 → 4429.48] And meanwhile, there is open source versions coming out that do not have those types of restrictions on them and are not suffering the same degradation that we're seeing on OpenAI's platform.
[4429.48 → 4432.48] So, ugh.
[4432.48 → 4434.48] It's going to be a fascinating time.
[4434.48 → 4440.48] We saw this huge boom, and it was like, wow, these guys are so far out ahead that what could ever possibly catch up?
[4440.48 → 4441.48] They've got all this brand recognition.
[4441.48 → 4444.48] It's like, oh, lawyers.
[4444.48 → 4447.48] That's who can catch up.
[4447.48 → 4449.48] That's not really catching up.
[4449.48 → 4451.48] That's slowing down the other guy.
[4451.48 → 4452.48] Yeah, yeah, fair.
[4452.48 → 4460.48] I know, I can't say how I know, but I know someone who works for an insurance firm that OpenAI tried to get insurance through for these types of things.
[4460.48 → 4465.48] And they were like, nope, no shot is that happening.
[4465.48 → 4471.48] I don't know if they ended up getting insurance or not, but yeah, they were wise to that one.
[4471.48 → 4472.48] Good luck, OpenAI.
[4472.48 → 4474.48] Shall we give away this motherboard?
[4474.48 → 4476.48] Yeah, let's give away this motherboard.
[4476.48 → 4477.48] Why don't you come up on here?
[4477.48 → 4479.48] Come on up, come on down.
[4485.48 → 4488.48] If I understand correctly, you built almost a two...
[4488.48 → 4489.48] Oh, there we go.
[4489.48 → 4490.48] They fixed it.
[4490.48 → 4491.48] They fixed it.
[4491.48 → 4492.48] We're good.
[4492.48 → 4493.48] We're good.
[4493.48 → 4494.48] Sick.
[4494.48 → 4496.48] You built an almost two-meter tall motherboard towers?
[4496.48 → 4497.48] Yes.
[4497.48 → 4499.48] That is freaking awesome.
[4499.48 → 4501.48] As someone who is also...
[4501.48 → 4502.48] Vertically challenged.
[4502.48 → 4506.48] Hey, we have to own it.
[4506.48 → 4507.48] You're kidding!
[4507.48 → 4509.48] How did you get up there?
[4509.48 → 4511.48] Share your secrets.
[4511.48 → 4513.48] I used a man lift.
[4513.48 → 4514.48] A man lift.
[4514.48 → 4515.48] Really?
[4515.48 → 4516.48] I snuck it in my pocket.
[4516.48 → 4517.48] No, seriously though.
[4517.48 → 4519.48] How did you get up to 1.85 meters?
[4519.48 → 4522.48] That's about the only way I could do it.
[4522.48 → 4523.48] Did they have ladders?
[4523.48 → 4524.48] No, they didn't.
[4524.48 → 4525.48] No, but...
[4525.48 → 4527.48] No, how did you do it?
[4527.48 → 4530.48] He's keeping his secrets for next year.
[4530.48 → 4531.48] Hippy toes.
[4531.48 → 4532.48] That's all I had.
[4532.48 → 4533.48] All right.
[4533.48 → 4534.48] Well, congratulations.
[4534.48 → 4535.48] Enjoy your motherboard.
[4535.48 → 4536.48] Thank you.
[4536.48 → 4537.48] All right.
[4537.48 → 4538.48] Take care, man.
[4538.48 → 4539.48] Man lift.
[4539.48 → 4551.48] That's what we call it when Luke holds me up at the front of the Titanic.
[4551.48 → 4553.48] He's the man.
[4553.48 → 4554.48] I own it.
[4554.48 → 4557.48] Got a few more merch messages here for you.
[4557.48 → 4558.48] All right.
[4558.48 → 4559.48] Hit me, Dan.
[4559.48 → 4560.48] Sure thing.
[4560.48 → 4561.48] Hope you all are having fun.
[4561.48 → 4564.48] How long is it to do the WAN show in front of a live audience?
[4567.48 → 4569.48] It's really stressful.
[4569.48 → 4573.48] Oh, oh, oh, but I have powers.
[4573.48 → 4574.48] Okay.
[4574.48 → 4575.48] Okay.
[4575.48 → 4576.48] Let's do the thing.
[4576.48 → 4578.48] We rehearsed something before you guys all got here.
[4578.48 → 4579.48] You online viewers.
[4579.48 → 4580.48] Don't mess it up this time.
[4580.48 → 4581.48] Okay.
[4581.48 → 4582.48] Ready?
[4582.48 → 4583.48] Okay.
[4583.48 → 4584.48] Wait, wait, wait.
[4584.48 → 4585.48] They need to switch.
[4585.48 → 4586.48] Do this thing.
[4586.48 → 4587.48] And then you're going to watch.
[4587.48 → 4588.48] You're going to see.
[4588.48 → 4589.48] You're going to see a thing that's going to happen.
[4589.48 → 4590.48] Crowd view.
[4590.48 → 4591.48] Crowd view.
[4591.48 → 4592.48] We need the crowd feed.
[4592.48 → 4593.48] Do picture in picture.
[4593.48 → 4594.48] Use the technology.
[4594.48 → 4595.48] Okay.
[4595.48 → 4596.48] Here we go.
[4596.48 → 4597.48] Ready, guys?
[4597.48 → 4598.48] Show them.
[4598.48 → 4599.48] Give them your best shot.
[4599.48 → 4600.48] Here we go.
[4600.48 → 4613.48] You right there didn't stand.
[4613.48 → 4616.48] These are blinding, but I can smell it.
[4620.48 → 4621.48] I don't know.
[4621.48 → 4622.48] Pretty fun.
[4622.48 → 4624.48] Pretty fun, actually.
[4624.48 → 4626.48] Really nerve-wracking.
[4626.48 → 4638.48] You know, it's a funny thing how you can get used to something and yet you throw the smallest variation at it, and you're all of a sudden like...
[4638.48 → 4645.48] Okay, I remember this one time I ran into my kindergarten teacher at the fruit and vegetable store.
[4645.48 → 4653.48] And she had me for like one and like a helper year.
[4653.48 → 4657.48] Like she was a second, and then she was my main teacher.
[4657.48 → 4662.48] And this is only maybe like I'm in grade two, and she had me for like K-1 or something like that.
[4662.48 → 4666.48] So like I have not been out of her class for that long.
[4666.48 → 4669.48] And I run into her, and I'm just like...
[4673.48 → 4674.48] Couldn't even say hi.
[4674.48 → 4676.48] Is that like what happened at the badminton match?
[4676.48 → 4677.48] My dad's making conversation...
[4677.48 → 4678.48] No, that was just...
[4679.48 → 4680.48] I'm awkward.
[4680.48 → 4682.48] People found that video.
[4682.48 → 4683.48] Yeah, I know.
[4683.48 → 4684.48] Yeah.
[4684.48 → 4692.48] Anyway, so you see someone a little bit out of context, and it can throw you for a bit of a loop.
[4692.48 → 4693.48] I ran through...
[4693.48 → 4698.48] I went through this really weird thing in the early days of LTT store.
[4698.48 → 4708.48] Obviously, you know, you have to have pictures of your merchandise, and you know, A, because I think it's really authentic for us to model our own merchandise.
[4708.48 → 4714.48] You know, A, because if it's not good enough for us to even bother to put it on once, it's probably not good enough for you.
[4714.48 → 4717.48] And B, because it's kind of like the ultimate...
[4717.48 → 4718.48] Who was it?
[4718.48 → 4730.48] Dove who did that thing, Campaign for Real Beauty, whatever, where instead of having models with, you know, super unrealistic Barbie movie levels of physical perfection, they just like used real people.
[4730.48 → 4731.48] Good movie.
[4731.48 → 4732.48] I think it was them.
[4732.48 → 4733.48] Yeah, I actually really enjoyed it too.
[4733.48 → 4736.48] So it's the ultimate that.
[4736.48 → 4737.48] This is really us.
[4737.48 → 4742.48] Like really us, the people who worked on these products, who designed them.
[4742.48 → 4753.48] Like you'll see, you'll see folks like Sarah or Lloyd or, you know, Alameda or, you know, the rest of the team that actually makes these products.
[4753.48 → 4756.48] You know, the engineering team even, you know, we don't like to hide anybody away.
[4756.48 → 4761.48] If people volunteer for merch photos, we try to accommodate it and, you know, we don't always have room for everybody.
[4761.48 → 4765.48] But, you know, we just, we try to have real people there, right?
[4765.48 → 4767.48] And that's super, that's super cool.
[4767.48 → 4770.48] And then the other main reason is because I'm cheap.
[4770.48 → 4773.48] Hiring models is expensive.
[4773.48 → 4775.48] I do think it's better this way either way.
[4775.48 → 4777.48] No, I do think, I do genuinely think it's better this way.
[4777.48 → 4784.48] So anyway, that was, that was why we came up with the idea of having our own people model all of our own products.
[4784.48 → 4794.48] And the problem was that even the this is even before the first underwear shoot, which is one of the times that I think I have been most uncomfortable at work.
[4794.48 → 4795.48] Yeah.
[4795.48 → 4798.48] Like it is, it is, you know.
[4798.48 → 4801.48] Every once in a while I'll go on the store for like a legitimate work reason.
[4801.48 → 4804.48] And I'm scrolling through, and I'm like, oh, there's Linus in his underwear.
[4804.48 → 4805.48] What can I say?
[4805.48 → 4807.48] A pleasant sight.
[4807.48 → 4816.48] And it's such a we talked before the show.
[4816.48 → 4819.48] He was like, how many people in the audience do you think are wearing LTT merch?
[4819.48 → 4821.48] We started looking around for like shirts and sweaters and stuff.
[4821.48 → 4824.48] And I was like, hmm, we don't actually know.
[4824.48 → 4828.48] It's a funny thing though.
[4828.48 → 4833.48] Even before I did that first underwear shoot, what I discovered was that.
[4833.48 → 4835.48] Oh, he's doing it now.
[4835.48 → 4836.48] He's coming off.
[4836.48 → 4837.48] You know, I'd put on it.
[4844.48 → 4845.48] Okay.
[4849.48 → 4851.48] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4851.48 → 4852.48] I was kidding.
[4852.48 → 4853.48] We're streaming to Twitch.
[4853.48 → 4854.48] We actually can't.
[4854.48 → 4855.48] Yeah.
[4855.48 → 4856.48] There's no pool.
[4856.48 → 4857.48] No hot tub.
[4857.48 → 4858.48] No hot tub.
[4858.48 → 4859.48] No hot tub.
[4859.48 → 4860.48] Next time.
[4860.48 → 4865.48] Oh, actually, since I have your guys' attention, we don't have a hot tub, but we do have a dunk
[4865.48 → 4866.48] tank tomorrow.
[4866.48 → 4870.48] We're going to be, yeah, we're raising money for charity.
[4870.48 → 4874.48] So you can, I don't remember exactly how it works, but you can buy, you can buy balls and
[4874.48 → 4878.48] then you can Huck them at the dunk tank, and I'll be, I'll be in there for an hour tomorrow.
[4878.48 → 4880.48] So hopefully I see you guys out there.
[4880.48 → 4881.48] Yeah.
[4881.48 → 4882.48] I think there's raffle winners get a throw as well.
[4882.48 → 4883.48] Okay.
[4883.48 → 4884.48] Sure.
[4884.48 → 4887.48] I'm going to be posting it here and to the BYOC stage if you want to knock outside.
[4887.48 → 4888.48] Yeah.
[4888.48 → 4889.48] Yeah.
[4889.48 → 4890.48] Yeah.
[4890.48 → 4891.48] Yeah.
[4891.48 → 4892.48] So we'll, we'll get with you guys about that.
[4892.48 → 4893.48] But anyway, it was such a weird experience for me going through my first merch shoot because
[4893.48 → 4902.48] I'm like standing there in the shirt, and I'm like, I have spent the last decade of my
[4902.48 → 4904.48] life in front of a camera.
[4904.48 → 4906.48] It feels weird, very weird having photos taken.
[4906.48 → 4912.48] Why all of a sudden, because it's, you flip a dial to photo mode instead of video mode.
[4912.48 → 4918.48] Do I just have absolutely no idea where to put my hands?
[4918.48 → 4919.48] Yeah.
[4919.48 → 4921.48] You put a video camera in front of me.
[4921.48 → 4922.48] I could talk all day.
[4922.48 → 4923.48] No problem.
[4923.48 → 4925.48] You see him shift into presenter mode.
[4925.48 → 4926.48] But you tell me don't talk.
[4926.48 → 4939.48] And I'm like, I just don't know what to do with it.
[4939.48 → 4941.48] And like massive props to our team.
[4941.48 → 4946.48] Most of our merch photos are taken by Hoffman and Maria, if I recall correctly.
[4946.48 → 4948.48] I might have missed someone, and I'm so sorry if I did.
[4948.48 → 4950.48] But you know, massive credit to our team.
[4950.48 → 4953.48] They really do a great job of making the experience more comfortable.
[4953.48 → 4956.48] Like the, the, the couples' underwear shoot that I did with Yvonne.
[4956.48 → 4961.48] It was great that Maria was there to kind of, you know, keep the mood really light because,
[4961.48 → 4965.48] you know, just, you know, casually two of the company executives just like stripping down to our,
[4965.48 → 4970.48] to our underwear in the office, and you know, there's people there and everything.
[4970.48 → 4971.48] I don't know.
[4971.48 → 4972.48] It's such a weird thing too.
[4972.48 → 4975.48] Stripping in front of her would have been super weird.
[4975.48 → 4979.48] But standing in front of her now in your underwear was normal.
[4982.48 → 4983.48] Sure.
[4983.48 → 4984.48] It's just, it's bizarre.
[4984.48 → 4987.48] So anyway, coming back to the original question,
[4987.48 → 4991.48] something about the live audience really does feel very, very different.
[4991.48 → 4997.48] Even though this is the same WAN show with the same producer and the same tardiness.
[4997.48 → 4998.48] Sorry.
[4998.48 → 5001.48] No, no, you weren't late.
[5001.48 → 5002.48] That's true.
[5002.48 → 5003.48] So it's not actually, it's tardiness.
[5003.48 → 5004.48] New, different tardiness.
[5004.48 → 5005.48] Yes.
[5005.48 → 5008.48] We're like, we're like 24 hours late.
[5008.48 → 5009.48] It's a it's...
[5009.48 → 5010.48] Oh, come on.
[5010.48 → 5011.48] It was rescheduled.
[5011.48 → 5012.48] What the hell?
[5012.48 → 5013.48] 30 minutes?
[5013.48 → 5014.48] He's just trying to defend it because it was him.
[5014.48 → 5018.48] I got it down to 30 minutes, and you're complaining about 12 hours and 30 minutes.
[5018.48 → 5022.48] Look, what we can all agree on is that this is, it's a very tardy show.
[5022.48 → 5023.48] Okay.
[5023.48 → 5024.48] Yeah.
[5024.48 → 5025.48] Sorry.
[5025.48 → 5026.48] My, my sincere apologies.
[5026.48 → 5027.48] All right.
[5027.48 → 5028.48] Do you have another merch message for us?
[5028.48 → 5029.48] Sure I do.
[5029.48 → 5031.48] Let's, let's get a couple, and then we'll move on to one more topic.
[5031.48 → 5035.48] You know, for someone who had another life as an audio professional, this is driving
[5035.48 → 5036.48] me absolutely crazy.
[5036.48 → 5037.48] Hmm.
[5037.48 → 5039.48] For the love of God, keep your mic close to your mouth.
[5039.48 → 5040.48] That's too close.
[5040.48 → 5041.48] That's too close.
[5041.48 → 5042.48] Okay.
[5042.48 → 5044.48] That's what he said, but I couldn't understand him.
[5044.48 → 5047.48] You keep, you keep doing this.
[5047.48 → 5049.48] It's a personal pet peeve.
[5049.48 → 5050.48] It drives me absolutely crazy.
[5050.48 → 5051.48] I don't want to talk.
[5051.48 → 5053.48] Which is why he's doing it.
[5053.48 → 5055.48] I don't want to talk into it.
[5055.48 → 5058.48] You heard me ranting earlier.
[5058.48 → 5059.48] Didn't you?
[5059.48 → 5060.48] No.
[5060.48 → 5061.48] What, what, what?
[5061.48 → 5064.48] Oh, I was going off about this when I was talking to, when I was talking to Luke earlier.
[5064.48 → 5068.48] Just like, like how impossible it is for people to hold a mic up to their mouth.
[5068.48 → 5072.48] I'm holding it to my mouth when I'm talking, and I move it away when I want to breathe.
[5072.48 → 5075.48] To be fair right now, this thing literally does not fit on my head.
[5075.48 → 5076.48] Oh no, not you, not you.
[5076.48 → 5077.48] This is better.
[5077.48 → 5078.48] Okay, alright.
[5078.48 → 5079.48] Sorry, okay, here we go.
[5079.48 → 5080.48] Oh my god, Dan.
[5080.48 → 5085.48] Hey, LLD and LTX.
[5085.48 → 5090.48] Any news on Float plane coming to TV streamers such as Apple TV and Nvidia Shield?
[5090.48 → 5091.48] Oh.
[5091.48 → 5101.48] This is a pretty decent time to shout out the Linus Media Group dot, Linus Media Group dot
[5101.48 → 5103.48] com slash jobs.
[5103.48 → 5104.48] We got there.
[5104.48 → 5105.48] Check out that.
[5105.48 → 5107.48] I need more front end developers.
[5107.48 → 5113.48] Right now, Jaden, bless his soul, is doing all the front end development for Float plane
[5113.48 → 5115.48] and all the development for the apps.
[5115.48 → 5117.48] So, he needs some help.
[5117.48 → 5119.48] This is the job site.
[5119.48 → 5120.48] Go apply.
[5120.48 → 5121.48] It's literally at the very top.
[5121.48 → 5122.48] Yeah.
[5122.48 → 5123.48] Yeah.
[5123.48 → 5124.48] He needs some help.
[5124.48 → 5130.48] But yeah, once we have more workforce in app and front end, we do want to try to support
[5130.48 → 5131.48] those things.
[5131.48 → 5134.48] But there's a lot of stuff to do.
[5134.48 → 5135.48] So, yeah.
[5135.48 → 5140.48] Did you leak something?
[5140.48 → 5141.48] No.
[5141.48 → 5143.48] What was the bingo?
[5143.48 → 5144.48] I don't know.
[5144.48 → 5145.48] Probably...
[5145.48 → 5146.48] WAN Show Bingo.
[5146.48 → 5147.48] Oh, yeah.
[5147.48 → 5148.48] People are playing WAN Show Bingo.
[5148.48 → 5149.48] Oh, yeah.
[5149.48 → 5150.48] They probably were already.
[5150.48 → 5152.48] It's a whole thing.
[5152.48 → 5157.48] I suggested it being late thinking nobody would get that.
[5157.48 → 5158.48] Yeah.
[5158.48 → 5159.48] Yeah.
[5159.48 → 5160.48] I...
[5160.48 → 5161.48] Yeah.
[5161.48 → 5162.48] All right, Jaden.
[5162.48 → 5163.48] Hit me again.
[5163.48 → 5164.48] Sure.
[5164.48 → 5165.48] Last one.
[5165.48 → 5166.48] And then, well, I think we'll move on to a final topic.
[5166.48 → 5167.48] Hi, Linus.
[5167.48 → 5169.48] Have you got any labs updates?
[5169.48 → 5172.48] And is there any big projects in the pipeline?
[5172.48 → 5173.48] Oh, man.
[5173.48 → 5179.48] Labs was super, super exciting because we were doing tours over the last couple of days.
[5179.48 → 5185.48] And I got to kind of listen in on some of the tours and I got to find out about things
[5185.48 → 5186.48] I didn't know about.
[5186.48 → 5193.48] For example, did you know that we have a couple of software-defined radios in the RF chamber
[5193.48 → 5197.48] now that will go up to 7 gigahertz and will be ready for millimetre waves sometime next
[5197.48 → 5202.48] year that will allow us to take phones and not just like measure how good their reception
[5202.48 → 5207.48] is, but also find out how much low reception affects their battery life.
[5207.48 → 5211.48] And we'll be able to see how good their reception is at every different off-axis angle.
[5211.48 → 5215.48] And apparently, this is like a big problem in the wireless industry.
[5215.48 → 5221.48] Devices are getting approved for carrier use that have antenna issues so bad that sitting
[5221.48 → 5226.48] on one cushion on a couch, you can have fine signal and be browsing your x.com or whatever
[5226.48 → 5228.48] else it is that you're doing.
[5228.48 → 5230.48] Really doesn't roll off the tongue, does it?
[5230.48 → 5231.48] No.
[5231.48 → 5235.48] And then you move two cushions over and your reception sucks and your video call is cutting
[5235.48 → 5236.48] out or whatever it is that you're doing.
[5236.48 → 5239.48] To be fair, it sounds like something you probably shouldn't do.
[5239.48 → 5240.48] Going on x.com?
[5240.48 → 5241.48] Which is maybe okay.
[5241.48 → 5246.48] Yeah, okay, but let's, okay, what about, you know, being on a video call with your relative?
[5246.48 → 5248.48] That you should do, okay?
[5248.48 → 5251.48] Aunt Muriel deserves the time spent with you.
[5251.48 → 5252.48] Call your mom.
[5252.48 → 5255.48] Even if she's only calling because she needs tech support.
[5255.48 → 5264.48] Anyway, so we're going to be able to, you know, find out, you know, which of these devices
[5264.48 → 5268.48] are slipping under the radar through, you know, back alley deals.
[5268.48 → 5273.48] Oh, man, I'm really, really excited about what they showed me with Mark Bench.
[5273.48 → 5277.48] We had live demos running for everyone who came through the tours.
[5277.48 → 5282.48] Any of the whales and orcas or anyone who booked a tour, how cool is Mark Bench?
[5282.48 → 5284.48] Ah!
[5284.48 → 5286.48] It's going to change everything, you guys.
[5286.48 → 5291.48] We had V1 on display, which is just games with built-in benchmarks and collecting telemetry
[5291.48 → 5295.48] data and, like, automating the running, which is, like, pretty cool, but you could have done
[5295.48 → 5297.48] it with AutoHotkey if you really wanted to.
[5297.48 → 5303.48] Then we've got V2, where now we've got replays from games that support that but do not have
[5303.48 → 5305.48] built-in benchmarks, like Rocket League V2.
[5305.48 → 5309.48] We had those running live, collecting all the telemetry data we need.
[5309.48 → 5315.48] The team has the CPU overhead on the client system down to, I believe, under 1% now,
[5315.48 → 5317.48] which is absolutely flipping incredible.
[5317.48 → 5321.48] Like, this is not just about developing a way to run automated benchmarks.
[5321.48 → 5325.48] This is about doing it in a way that is scientific and repeatable and reliable.
[5325.48 → 5327.48] Man, it's really exciting.
[5327.48 → 5331.48] But what I got to see, actually not on the tour, sorry, you guys didn't get to see this,
[5331.48 → 5341.48] but what I have seen is V3, which is going to be playing, having Mark Bench play the games,
[5341.48 → 5347.48] putting all the inputs into a game for ones that do not have integrated benchmarks,
[5347.48 → 5351.48] not support replays that can be played back in-engine and put a load on the GPU,
[5351.48 → 5359.48] and just don't support anything at all, but still allow us to get real-world, in-game,
[5359.48 → 5361.48] in-engine performance results from.
[5361.48 → 5367.48] And then, oh, there's another project that they just finished that I'm going to see the results for,
[5367.48 → 5377.48] I believe, early this coming week, where we bought, like, a metric WAC, which is, I think, 12 or 13?
[5377.48 → 5379.48] That is the exact definition.
[5379.48 → 5381.48] Yeah, 7800 X3D processors.
[5381.48 → 5386.48] Because the problem is that in the old days, if you wanted to parallelize your testing, right?
[5386.48 → 5394.48] So if you wanted to say, okay, we've got a GPU review coming up, and we want to test 30 games,
[5394.48 → 5400.48] and we want to test, you know, 30 different GPUs.
[5400.48 → 5403.48] What is that? 900 tests?
[5403.48 → 5409.48] In the time that we have with the cards, we couldn't conceivably run them all in a single bench.
[5409.48 → 5413.48] Now, in the old days, you could have parallelized that relatively easily.
[5413.48 → 5421.48] You just could buy more test benches, because the processors ran at three, exactly three gigahertz,
[5421.48 → 5424.48] and there was not much performance variation between them.
[5424.48 → 5427.48] But now, with turboboost or precision boost or...
[5427.48 → 5428.48] Auto overclocking.
[5428.48 → 5434.48] Yeah, yeah, essentially auto overclocking, depending on, you know, how much you won or lost the silicon lottery,
[5434.48 → 5442.48] you can have very measurable performance differences from one identical system to the next one.
[5442.48 → 5451.48] So what the team did was they bought a metric WAC, which is 13 or 12, 7800 X3D processors,
[5451.48 → 5454.48] and then they ran them one after the other after the other,
[5454.48 → 5459.48] and basically took our outliers on the high performance side and on the low performance side.
[5459.48 → 5463.48] Maybe just took them home? I don't know what happened to them.
[5463.48 → 5465.48] Something happened to them.
[5465.48 → 5470.48] And we ended up with five that are in the middle that are within 1% of each other.
[5470.48 → 5476.48] So what you're going to see is you're going to see over time, as we create these validation processes,
[5476.48 → 5482.48] you're going to see us massively parallelize our testing, which is going to allow us to spit out way more data.
[5482.48 → 5486.48] And I'm not just talking like a review, because a review is good. A review is very interesting.
[5486.48 → 5493.48] But a review only comes around when the product launches. And so in the long term, is that really?
[5493.48 → 5499.48] We've gotten to the point where GPU product cycles have stretched out past less than a year,
[5499.48 → 5504.48] which is when I first got into this stuff, to about a yearly cadence, to a bearish, to two years.
[5504.48 → 5507.48] I mean, we can have a GPU family that's sitting around for two, three years at this point.
[5507.48 → 5511.48] So you could be shopping for this thing two years down the road.
[5511.48 → 5516.48] And what use is that launch review on ancient drivers looking at ancient games?
[5516.48 → 5518.48] No, we want to go back, and we want to retest this stuff.
[5518.48 → 5524.48] So how cool would it be if we could get enough processors, enough benches that are within our 1% margin of error,
[5524.48 → 5532.48] and we could basically say, okay, look, yeah, this GPU is going to go sit on this bench for like a month.
[5532.48 → 5539.48] And it's going to go through every game, across every driver revision, and we're really going to track like what's been going on
[5539.48 → 5540.48] with the development of this card.
[5540.48 → 5544.48] I mean, particularly for something like Intel Arc, that would have been absolutely fascinating.
[5544.48 → 5545.48] Oh, absolutely.
[5545.48 → 5549.48] But if we don't have these parallelization processes, we're not going to be able to do that.
[5549.48 → 5550.48] Yeah.
[5550.48 → 5551.48] Because we won't be able to trust the data.
[5551.48 → 5553.48] You won't be able to compare it to anything else in the database.
[5553.48 → 5559.48] So, yeah, the team was explaining that to some of the people who were going through the tour.
[5559.48 → 5562.48] Oh, man, have you seen the mouse robot?
[5562.48 → 5564.48] Yes.
[5564.48 → 5565.48] It's pretty cool.
[5565.48 → 5566.48] Okay.
[5566.48 → 5568.48] It's kind of Jacky right now.
[5568.48 → 5575.48] It's all 3D printed, but it's 3D printed in such a way that everything is, I think they called it like plated or something.
[5575.48 → 5576.48] I can't remember what they called it.
[5576.48 → 5585.48] But basically, it means that every part is flat and can be CNC'd on a two-dimensional CNC router or mill.
[5585.48 → 5592.48] So that means it's pretty much ready for manufacturing once we've got all the kinks ironed out.
[5592.48 → 5604.48] But what was really cool is that they've got just like these 3D printer motors that are like moving the mouse back and forth and then taking, comparing the real data that's output from the mouse from the expected data.
[5604.48 → 5611.48] So based on the DPI that's configured, how far it's supposed to have moved versus how far it actually thinks it moved.
[5611.48 → 5618.48] So we're going to be able to really nail down precision and accuracy testing for mice, which is all very fine and cool.
[5618.48 → 5621.48] But then they started talking about the juiced up one.
[5621.48 → 5627.48] I forget what the exact kind of motors that they're planning to use.
[5627.48 → 5629.48] Is it the clear path one?
[5629.48 → 5631.48] I want to say yes.
[5631.48 → 5632.48] Linear mode.
[5632.48 → 5639.48] They're planning to use high performance linear motors with the idea being like right now it's like this big, right?
[5639.48 → 5643.48] Because it's just using like an old 3D printing bed or something like that.
[5643.48 → 5650.48] And the idea is that they're going to be able to rip these mice at speeds of around five meters a second.
[5650.48 → 5655.48] With just unbelievable acceleration.
[5655.48 → 5657.48] So we're going to be able to really split hairs.
[5657.48 → 5662.48] And you know, it's one of those things where I feel like a lot of people look at the lab's content and go,
[5662.48 → 5663.48] well, why does it matter?
[5663.48 → 5668.48] You buy a power supply, your computer turns on, who cares?
[5668.48 → 5673.48] But I have never been of that mindset.
[5673.48 → 5681.48] Like I remember getting into like the text equivalent of screaming matches with people on the forums in the old days,
[5681.48 → 5695.48] where some people had this attitude that was like, look, if they want to buy a Pentium dual-core, you know, instead of an Athlon 64 X2,
[5695.48 → 5700.48] and they want to pay more, and they want less performance, and they're happy with that, you know, why does it matter?
[5700.48 → 5702.48] I'm like, it matters!
[5702.48 → 5706.48] They could have had more for less!
[5706.48 → 5711.48] Why would they accept anything but the most for the least?
[5711.48 → 5714.48] It's wrong!
[5714.48 → 5717.48] I love how you say this is back in the day.
[5717.48 → 5721.48] You built literally a whole company to accomplish that goal.
[5722.48 → 5726.48] And then did it again, but you were like, this time with the lab.
[5726.48 → 5728.48] But better!
[5728.48 → 5730.48] More science!
[5730.48 → 5735.48] And so like, you know, why are we rewarding companies that are releasing subpar products?
[5735.48 → 5736.48] Why don't we care?
[5736.48 → 5738.48] We should care!
[5738.48 → 5744.48] If this one's a little bit better, and we can prove it, well then we should, we should get that one.
[5744.48 → 5747.48] And then we should put pressure on everybody else to do better.
[5747.48 → 5748.48] That's how the industry moves forward.
[5748.48 → 5750.48] That's the whole point!
[5750.48 → 5752.48] You should care!
[5752.48 → 5759.48] And so realistically, okay, whatever gaming mouse you choose to buy, I'm actually not going to judge
[5759.48 → 5761.48] because it's a peripheral.
[5761.48 → 5762.48] It's something you touch, right?
[5762.48 → 5764.48] I might judge a little bit.
[5764.48 → 5767.48] Okay.
[5767.48 → 5769.48] But it's something you touch.
[5769.48 → 5770.48] It's very subjective.
[5770.48 → 5777.48] If one of them makes your hand cramp, even though it has the best sensor, don't use it, obviously, right?
[5777.48 → 5784.48] But, and so, you know, in the mouse category, I think there are going to be a lot of, you know,
[5784.48 → 5788.48] well, really they're both pretty good, but pretty much it comes down to, you know,
[5788.48 → 5793.48] what's more comfortable for you or what has the software that you find most intuitive to use.
[5793.48 → 5798.48] But if all other things are equal, and you find both of them pretty much comfortable,
[5798.48 → 5804.48] why wouldn't you take the one that's like 0.1% more accurate?
[5804.48 → 5805.48] Yeah.
[5805.48 → 5806.48] Yeah.
[5806.48 → 5807.48] Yeah.
[5807.48 → 5808.48] Yeah.
[5808.48 → 5812.48] Or like, why wouldn't you get rid of your stupid dinky little like laptop mouse that you're using on your desktop?
[5812.48 → 5813.48] Oh, yeah.
[5813.48 → 5814.48] Because there's like no way.
[5814.48 → 5815.48] Yeah.
[5815.48 → 5816.48] Who was that?
[5816.48 → 5817.48] Electro boom.
[5817.48 → 5818.48] Yeah.
[5818.48 → 5819.48] Yeah.
[5819.48 → 5820.48] He's here.
[5820.48 → 5821.48] Yeah.
[5821.48 → 5822.48] Uh, Media, Media, are you?
[5822.48 → 5823.48] We can get you a new mouse, bro.
[5823.48 → 5824.48] Yeah.
[5824.48 → 5829.48] In fact, I think we actually have a sponsor locked in for the Media upgrade.
[5829.48 → 5832.48] I don't know if he knows that yet, but we're...
[5832.48 → 5834.48] We are getting you a new mouse, bro.
[5834.48 → 5835.48] We're getting him a makeover.
[5835.48 → 5836.48] Nice.
[5836.48 → 5837.48] Good.
[5837.48 → 5838.48] Yeah.
[5838.48 → 5839.48] It's going to be awesome.
[5839.48 → 5840.48] His workspace is utterly unacceptable.
[5840.48 → 5841.48] Yeah.
[5841.48 → 5842.48] Yeah.
[5842.48 → 5844.48] Except for the art, which is actually amazing and he painted it.
[5844.48 → 5845.48] Which is sick.
[5845.48 → 5846.48] Don't remember his scopes.
[5846.48 → 5847.48] And actually his treadmill.
[5847.48 → 5848.48] Yeah, his treadmill is pretty cool.
[5848.48 → 5851.48] Okay, so he's got some pretty cool stuff, but there are some things that are bad.
[5851.48 → 5853.48] We're going to fix everything that's not cool about it.
[5853.48 → 5854.48] Yeah.
[5854.48 → 5858.48] In fact, I think the sponsor is Asus DOG, who also sponsored LTX.
[5858.48 → 5862.48] So, yeah, we're going to be hooking up with some perfect stuff.
[5862.48 → 5863.48] Perfect stuff.
[5863.48 → 5864.48] Oh crap.
[5864.48 → 5866.48] Linus leaks a video is in the bingo.
[5866.48 → 5886.48] Speaking of our sponsor, Asus, I do want to address some of your feedback on the secret shopping, our sponsors video.
[5886.48 → 5896.48] Some viewers felt, and it's a hilarious thing because on YouTube, the interactions with the videos are almost overwhelmingly positive.
[5896.48 → 5898.48] And even Reddit wasn't that mad about it.
[5898.48 → 5902.48] But Flow plane was pretty salty about this video.
[5902.48 → 5915.48] Some viewers felt that we went unnecessarily soft on Asus, who spent an hour on the phone with our secret shopper and never quite managed to solve the problem until we made a suggestion that led them to the correct answer.
[5915.48 → 5922.48] And there's been some speculation that this is because Asus is a sponsor for us.
[5922.48 → 5934.48] Let me just take a moment to say, guys, if I was trying to brush Asus's treatment of us under the rug, would I have included them in the video?
[5934.48 → 5947.48] If I was trying to stall until after LTX when our sponsorship deal had gone through or whatever, would I have published the video before LTX?
[5947.48 → 5950.48] Like, come on, you guys.
[5950.48 → 5953.48] Yeah, because you didn't do every single sponsor we've ever had.
[5953.48 → 5957.48] You did a lot of them, but you could have had one less, and it would have been fine.
[5957.48 → 5959.48] We could have easily just cut it.
[5959.48 → 5961.48] We didn't because it's not right.
[5961.48 → 5968.48] If we wanted to make them look better, wouldn't we have just said that we didn't spend that long on the phone with them?
[5968.48 → 5975.48] Like, yes, the score of three might have felt a little generous.
[5975.48 → 5977.48] It was also the first one that I filmed.
[5977.48 → 5982.48] Like sometimes the simplest explanation really is the best one and there is no conspiracy theory.
[5982.48 → 5986.48] It was the first one that I filmed, and we didn't really have a clear scoring system yet.
[5986.48 → 5988.48] So I was like, I don't know.
[5988.48 → 5989.48] Kind of seems like a three.
[5989.48 → 5997.48] One of the other factors that I had to kind of consider in my decision was that I thought that I was going to be a good one.
[5997.48 → 6002.48] I thought that our problem was kind of nonsense.
[6002.48 → 6008.48] Like we basically intentionally misinterpreted the quick start guide in the worst possible way.
[6008.48 → 6023.48] And I feel like while, you know, three might have been a little bit generous, you know, I still would have at least had them end up with like a two, two and a half.
[6023.48 → 6031.48] Like there's no way I would have changed it that much because for me, and I feel like we just weren't really, we weren't really on the same page about what the scale was.
[6031.48 → 6034.48] I saw one person complain that it should have been minus five.
[6034.48 → 6035.48] What?
[6035.48 → 6038.48] And I was like, there is no minus five.
[6038.48 → 6042.48] Zero is that we weren't able to get in contact at all.
[6042.48 → 6046.48] One is, you know, rudeness, dismissiveness, and not dealing with the issue properly.
[6046.48 → 6053.48] You know, two stars are not being ultimately satisfied with the result, or it is like taking too long.
[6053.48 → 6059.48] Three stars, you know, for me was, hey, we did get the issue resolved even if it wasn't ideal.
[6059.48 → 6065.48] Like, and I feel like that was something that was probably the wrong rating system.
[6065.48 → 6073.48] I think that what it should have been was more along the lines of like five stars is that I am overwhelmingly satisfied, and I want to recommend these guys to everybody.
[6073.48 → 6074.48] This was a good experience.
[6074.48 → 6075.48] And zero.
[6075.48 → 6076.48] I am now a promoter of this.
[6076.48 → 6077.48] Yeah.
[6077.48 → 6083.48] And three stars is like, I actually had a pretty bad time, which is how I feel like a lot of consumers do.
[6083.48 → 6087.48] But I was treating it more like a linear scale where zero really was.
[6087.48 → 6089.48] We got absolutely nothing done.
[6089.48 → 6094.48] We got nowhere with these guys and five was absolute complete perfection.
[6094.48 → 6105.48] So I think what ended up happening is I ended up really compressed in the kind of three to four range because we kind of got everything mostly solved, even if there, even if there were some challenges.
[6105.48 → 6109.48] Anyway, the point of the series is we do want to keep our sponsors accountable.
[6109.48 → 6113.48] We did secret shop them, and we didn't try to hide anything from you guys.
[6113.48 → 6117.48] That was why even though we gave a score, we showed you the process.
[6117.48 → 6120.48] If we were trying to hide something, we easily could have.
[6120.48 → 6122.48] We made the decision not to.
[6122.48 → 6130.48] So all I would ask is, hey, you know, please try to give us the benefit of the doubt, right?
[6130.48 → 6136.48] Like being transparent about our relationship with our sponsors also means that we are opening ourselves up to criticism.
[6136.48 → 6147.48] If we were really trying to hide favouritism, guys, we wouldn't do these kinds of videos at all, or we would just, you know, select a different sponsor who we think will score better.
[6147.48 → 6151.48] If we were just trying to get some brownie points with you guys, we don't always get it perfect.
[6151.48 → 6159.48] And I actually, I do agree with the audience feedback that three was probably too generous, but it has absolutely nothing to do with that.
[6159.48 → 6161.48] We're trying to hold on to a sponsorship.
[6161.48 → 6171.48] In fact, I can tell you guys that it definitely ruffled some feathers over there, but that's okay.
[6171.48 → 6172.48] Right?
[6172.48 → 6185.48] That's part of that's part of why is this benefits from us talking about them because they know that, hey, if they stay the course, and they take their lumps, and they take that criticism, and they try to act on these things and fix them, then we'll continue working with them.
[6185.48 → 6189.48] And that credibility will mean that people will go to them.
[6189.48 → 6193.48] So that's all I have to say about that.
[6193.48 → 6196.48] Viet, no, sorry.
[6196.48 → 6198.48] Forrest Gump preference.
[6198.48 → 6199.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6199.48 → 6202.48] I don't have my swear button, so I can't actually do the thing.
[6202.48 → 6203.48] Anyway.
[6203.48 → 6206.48] Uh, should we move into when after dark?
[6206.48 → 6207.48] Oh.
[6207.48 → 6209.48] I know you have dinner to get to in two minutes.
[6209.48 → 6210.48] Is that actually like a thing?
[6210.48 → 6212.48] I'm just going to go unplug all the lights.
[6212.48 → 6213.48] I don't care.
[6213.48 → 6214.48] Uh.
[6214.48 → 6215.48] Yeah, I think so though.
[6215.48 → 6216.48] Do we have hobos in them?
[6216.48 → 6217.48] Can we have red?
[6217.48 → 6218.48] Is there any other like important topics?
[6218.48 → 6219.48] I don't really think so.
[6219.48 → 6220.48] I'm just checking.
[6220.48 → 6221.48] I don't know.
[6221.48 → 6225.48] There was the Tesla rigging battery range thing, which is pretty uncool.
[6225.48 → 6226.48] That's bad.
[6226.48 → 6227.48] We shouldn't do that.
[6227.48 → 6229.48] Oh, the Google DRM for websites thing.
[6229.48 → 6230.48] Oh, that's pretty messed up.
[6230.48 → 6232.48] Yeah, I want you to talk about that.
[6232.48 → 6233.48] Can we like fire through it?
[6233.48 → 6234.48] Uh, sure, yeah.
[6234.48 → 6236.48] We should get through the Google thing at least.
[6236.48 → 6241.48] Okay, the Tesla one, basically they intentionally offered rosy estimates of how far you could go.
[6241.48 → 6245.48] So that you would like to think your car had better range than it did.
[6245.48 → 6248.48] But people like noticed that it doesn't actually go that far.
[6248.48 → 6256.48] So, um, they would complain and then Tesla created an internal team to suppress the complaints.
[6256.48 → 6264.48] Which is like, um, yeah, really, perfect, perfect company led by perfect leadership.
[6264.48 → 6265.48] It's perfect.
[6265.48 → 6266.48] Anyway.
[6266.48 → 6267.48] Okay.
[6267.48 → 6270.48] Google proposes DRM for websites.
[6270.48 → 6271.48] Sort of.
[6271.48 → 6273.48] Google engineers have published a paper titled the-
[6273.48 → 6274.48] Oh, hold on.
[6274.48 → 6275.48] Actually, sorry.
[6275.48 → 6276.48] One sec.
[6276.48 → 6277.48] Yeah.
[6277.48 → 6278.48] Yeah.
[6278.48 → 6281.48] The whales pointed out that, um, clearly I have no problem badmouthing a sponsor literally
[6281.48 → 6282.48] right in front of them.
[6282.48 → 6283.48] Tesla's actually here at LTX.
[6283.48 → 6284.48] Hey!
[6284.48 → 6285.48] Let's go.
[6285.48 → 6286.48] You know what?
[6286.48 → 6291.48] The truth is, I just don't give a shit anymore.
[6291.48 → 6292.48] Hey!
[6292.48 → 6293.48] I just-
[6293.48 → 6298.48] Like, where's my bag?
[6298.48 → 6303.48] Like, do you have any idea how many water bottles and screwdrivers and like backpacks
[6303.48 → 6305.48] these fine people have bought today?
[6305.48 → 6309.48] I am actually not beholden to anybody.
[6309.48 → 6310.48] Yeah.
[6310.48 → 6315.48] And like, sure, if we can take their money and build the lab faster and build this like
[6315.48 → 6317.48] world-class media organization, yeah, I'll do it.
[6317.48 → 6319.48] But I don't have to.
[6319.48 → 6322.48] And if they don't like it, if they don't like our rules of engagement,
[6322.48 → 6324.48] just send them to the boss.
[6324.48 → 6325.48] See you later.
[6325.48 → 6330.48] New meme.
[6330.48 → 6333.48] Yeah, probably.
[6333.48 → 6334.48] Yeah.
[6334.48 → 6335.48] All right.
[6335.48 → 6336.48] Yeah, sorry.
[6336.48 → 6337.48] Google proposes DRM for websites.
[6337.48 → 6338.48] Let's go.
[6338.48 → 6339.48] Yeah.
[6339.48 → 6343.48] Google engineers have published a paper titled the Web- or not the just Web Environment
[6343.48 → 6348.48] Integrity Explainer, which proposes that websites ask for tokens from users' machines.
[6348.48 → 6354.48] Those tokens would have been cryptographically verified by OS and browser-based testers.
[6354.48 → 6359.48] Google would then likely control which websites and browsers seem trustworthy.
[6359.48 → 6364.48] Which is why many critics on GitHub have called the idea DRM for websites.
[6364.48 → 6369.48] The paper claims that the proposal is to improve security and reduce bots and fake engagement,
[6369.48 → 6372.48] which might actually be true to be fair.
[6372.48 → 6377.48] However, if enacted, this would break most ad blockers, which is probably the real reason why.
[6377.48 → 6382.48] And squeeze the user base of alternative browsers that refuse to enact the system,
[6382.48 → 6387.48] as they will be unable to access a range of various websites.
[6387.48 → 6391.48] Obviously, the idea of a website requiring a specific browser isn't new,
[6391.48 → 6397.48] but the ubiquity of Chrome slash Chromium might mean something wholly different for the relative openness of the internet.
[6397.48 → 6401.48] Louis Grossman, who's here by the way, called the proposal-
[6401.48 → 6408.48] He called the proposal one of the scariest things he's ever heard in his life.
[6408.48 → 6410.48] And he lived in New York for years.
[6410.48 → 6411.48] Yeah.
[6411.48 → 6416.48] And honestly, from my perspective too, I think this would effectively spell-
[6416.48 → 6417.48] New Yorkers have no filter.
[6417.48 → 6420.48] Like at all-
[6420.48 → 6421.48] They just say anything.
[6421.48 → 6423.48] We know that. We've seen him do it.
[6423.48 → 6424.48] Yeah, we've seen him do it.
[6424.48 → 6432.48] But this would, in my opinion, effectively spell the end of what we have known up until this point as the internet.
[6432.48 → 6434.48] Okay, that's very doomsday-y.
[6434.48 → 6435.48] No, but actually-
[6435.48 → 6436.48] I'm not saying I disagree.
[6436.48 → 6437.48] Yeah.
[6437.48 → 6438.48] I'm just saying that's pretty doomsday-y.
[6438.48 → 6439.48] This would be like terrible.
[6439.48 → 6441.48] Yeah, I don't know.
[6441.48 → 6443.48] Maybe we're doom and glooming too much.
[6443.48 → 6447.48] Maybe they elaborate more and there's more to it, and there are different ways to engage with it.
[6447.48 → 6449.48] You can have different versions of a site, something like that.
[6449.48 → 6450.48] I don't know.
[6450.48 → 6455.48] Yeah, I agree with that guy.
[6455.48 → 6457.48] All right, I think it's time for WAN Show After Dark.
[6457.48 → 6458.48] Yeah.
[6458.48 → 6461.48] Yeah, WAN Show After Dark. Let's do this.
[6461.48 → 6463.48] Let me get my messages open here.
[6463.48 → 6464.48] Okay, first up.
[6464.48 → 6467.48] Oh, there we go.
[6467.48 → 6468.48] Thanks, guys.
[6468.48 → 6469.48] Wow.
[6469.48 → 6471.48] How have we not shown that view more?
[6471.48 → 6472.48] That looks awesome.
[6472.48 → 6473.48] That does look awesome.
[6473.48 → 6475.48] Yeah, change it up a bit.
[6475.48 → 6476.48] Wow.
[6476.48 → 6477.48] Sweet.
[6477.48 → 6478.48] Okay, first one here we-
[6478.48 → 6486.48] Hey, LL and D. Thanks for the float plane pass, but I was wondering what's the best-selling desk pad at LTX?
[6486.48 → 6487.48] Have a great LTX.
[6487.48 → 6489.48] I'm hoping to go someday.
[6489.48 → 6491.48] I don't know.
[6491.48 → 6493.48] I don't know.
[6493.48 → 6504.48] I know the best-selling desk pad online was the retro dinosaur one, but we had some suspicions.
[6504.48 → 6507.48] Is anyone from the LTX store team within Earshot?
[6507.48 → 6508.48] Nick Light?
[6508.48 → 6509.48] Anyone?
[6509.48 → 6510.48] They're like probably super busy.
[6510.48 → 6511.48] Are they at the BYOC stage?
[6511.48 → 6512.48] Yeah.
[6512.48 → 6514.48] Anybody from the BYOC stage have a merch person?
[6514.48 → 6515.48] Yeah.
[6515.48 → 6526.48] I don't actually have analytics for the sales today because we had to use like a different Canadian account and something, something.
[6526.48 → 6528.48] So I have actually no idea how much stuff we sold today.
[6528.48 → 6531.48] I just see most of you carrying it.
[6531.48 → 6532.48] So I assume it's a lot.
[6532.48 → 6547.48] So we had some theories that once people saw the other ones in person and especially once people were at the convention centre, like the Vancouver one would be more popular or the zero G one that Luz got in front of them would be more popular.
[6547.48 → 6555.48] So I truthfully just do not know the answer to that, but it used to be the dinosaur one, but the other, they all look absolutely amazing.
[6555.48 → 6558.48] What one do you think you've signed the most?
[6558.48 → 6560.48] I've heard dinosaurs!
[6560.48 → 6561.48] Oh.
[6561.48 → 6563.48] Sarah Butt, everyone.
[6563.48 → 6564.48] Sarah Butt.
[6564.48 → 6566.48] Totally unbiased.
[6567.48 → 6568.48] Yeah.
[6568.48 → 6569.48] Totally credible source of information.
[6569.48 → 6571.48] The designer of the dinosaur one.
[6571.48 → 6574.48] The one that I've signed most has actually been the Vancouver one today.
[6574.48 → 6575.48] Me too.
[6575.48 → 6577.48] So we'll see.
[6577.48 → 6578.48] Thanks.
[6578.48 → 6579.48] Another?
[6579.48 → 6580.48] Yep.
[6580.48 → 6582.48] Hello LTX and LLD.
[6582.48 → 6589.48] I would love a folding phone, passport style, but I have to stay iPhone due to everyone I know using iMessage.
[6589.48 → 6593.48] How long do you think it will take until Apple makes a folding phone?
[6593.48 → 6594.48] That's not true.
[6594.48 → 6595.48] Why?
[6595.48 → 6596.48] Yeah.
[6596.48 → 6599.48] What do you mean you have to stay on iPhone because everyone you know uses iMessage?
[6599.48 → 6600.48] Social stigma.
[6600.48 → 6601.48] Who cares?
[6601.48 → 6602.48] Oh.
[6602.48 → 6604.48] Oh my God, they're different colours.
[6604.48 → 6605.48] Who cares?
[6605.48 → 6607.48] Oh no, your bubbles are the wrong colour.
[6607.48 → 6609.48] Oh, I'm sorry.
[6609.48 → 6610.48] I can't.
[6610.48 → 6611.48] You do not have to.
[6611.48 → 6612.48] You can.
[6612.48 → 6613.48] You can.
[6613.48 → 6615.48] No, be the first one.
[6615.48 → 6620.48] No, no, I'm offended.
[6620.48 → 6621.48] I'm offended.
[6621.48 → 6625.48] I have no idea when we'll see a folding phone from Apple.
[6625.48 → 6633.48] Although I will say this based on my experience with the folding displays that I've used so far and how they like eventually crack.
[6633.48 → 6642.48] I suspect Apple's QA department probably said no for good reason to the at least.
[6642.48 → 6643.48] So I'm using a Z Fold 3.
[6643.48 → 6647.48] This is a couple generations old now, but I can see why they said no to this.
[6647.48 → 6651.48] I'd imagine that Apple will at least do a mostly pretty good job of validating it.
[6651.48 → 6656.48] And then they'll probably wait a couple of years and see if their validation was valid and then go from there.
[6656.48 → 6666.48] Also, man, I just I have no idea what operating system it would run like they have this weird thing that they do where no every device like needs its own operating system.
[6666.48 → 6683.48] So what are we going to have iOS iPadOS and I fold OS like I did what it would which one is going to allow you to lock the display in landscape mode on the home screen and which one won't you guys have noticed that what an arbitrary limitation of iOS.
[6683.48 → 6684.48] Right.
[6684.48 → 6687.48] The fact that you can't just go into landscape.
[6687.48 → 6690.48] They obviously did all the work for it for the iPad.
[6690.48 → 6692.48] So why can't why can't you do it?
[6692.48 → 6704.48] Yeah, I know you used to be able to you just use can anymore because I don't know screw you buy an iPad like they're not even interchangeable devices.
[6704.48 → 6707.48] So I don't know with the folding one be allowed to do that.
[6707.48 → 6709.48] Maybe it would be allowed to but only when it's unfold.
[6709.48 → 6712.48] All right, Dan hit me.
[6712.48 → 6715.48] Sure, I'm a little embarrassed by this one.
[6715.48 → 6722.48] Hi, LLD had the joy of seeing Dan frantically making the sponsor list for the intro at the Peoria booth earlier.
[6722.48 → 6729.48] What is the most frantic last-minute work that you had to do for an LTX before?
[6729.48 → 6731.48] An LTX.
[6731.48 → 6735.48] I've had a really easy time with every LTX.
[6735.48 → 6737.48] I just kind of show up, and I'm like this is cool man.
[6737.48 → 6738.48] And then I do my stuff.
[6738.48 → 6743.48] I have nothing to do with these.
[6743.48 → 6754.48] Man, I would say that the most frantic one for me was the story I told earlier where we were trying to turn 2018 into not a complete disaster.
[6754.48 → 6761.48] Like, I know it's because we worked really hard at the last minute to kind of turn things around a little bit.
[6761.48 → 6767.48] They, they, we, yeah, we, we came up with some stuff, and it was a it was a real challenge.
[6767.48 → 6768.48] It was not me.
[6768.48 → 6776.48] I, I helped, but it was a team effort and that was the most stressed I have ever been about LTX ever.
[6776.48 → 6777.48] Yeah.
[6777.48 → 6778.48] Oh, sorry.
[6778.48 → 6779.48] I got a message simultaneously.
[6779.48 → 6780.48] Hi, DLL.
[6780.48 → 6793.48] If cost and logistics were no issue, what would the number one thing each of you would want to make a reality for a future LTX?
[6793.48 → 6794.48] Oh.
[6794.48 → 6795.48] Free puppy!
[6795.48 → 6796.48] Wow.
[6796.48 → 6797.48] That's really tough.
[6797.48 → 6812.48] I mean, for me, it's already gotten kind of so close to what we had, what we could have ever hoped for it to be.
[6812.48 → 6819.48] We wanted it to be, you know, not just about Linus tech tips.
[6819.48 → 6825.48] Like that was, that was obviously some, some kindling that we could use to start the fire, right?
[6825.48 → 6832.48] It's to, to, to draw you guys in here for, you know, the Linus and Luke and, you know, the rest of their punk ass crew, right?
[6832.48 → 6841.48] But we had the, the, the, the greater vision for what could make it more than just that was to make it a better,
[6841.48 → 6847.48] but it was to make it about bringing together the community because LTX didn't actually start as a
[6847.48 → 6849.48] like a trade show.
[6849.48 → 6851.48] It didn't start as a convention.
[6851.48 → 6853.48] It started as a meetup.
[6853.48 → 6863.48] 2017 came about because it was becoming untenable for us to try to do like a lot of smaller meetups.
[6863.48 → 6870.48] And it was, it was kind of like, oh, well, if we could just get the community all in one place and sign everything they shove in front of our faces and take all the stuff out of it,
[6870.48 → 6875.48] places and take all the selfies that they could ever want and, you know, just talk, talk shop with people,
[6875.48 → 6881.48] then maybe that'll, that'll kind of be our, our solution to, to, to doing that in a, in a scalable way.
[6881.48 → 6884.48] And then it was, it was so awesome.
[6884.48 → 6889.48] And it was so cool bringing the community together like that, that the next time around, you know, we had the idea of like,
[6889.48 → 6893.48] oh, what if we could like to bring other creators out and then people could see more than just us.
[6893.48 → 6898.48] And then you can kind of see how it like starts to evolve into just this, this ever broadening definition of community.
[6898.48 → 6904.48] And obviously, you know, you have to bring brands in order to help pay for the thing, because believe it or not,
[6904.48 → 6906.48] we can't sell an unlimited number of whale tickets.
[6906.48 → 6910.48] It's funny. The whales actually asked me, why didn't you sell more whale tickets?
[6910.48 → 6915.48] Because we, you could have, you know, made this thing super mega profitable if you just sold more whale tickets.
[6915.48 → 6920.48] And I was like, right, but there's five of you here or six of you or whatever at the, at the whale dinner.
[6920.48 → 6924.48] You, did you really want there to be 60? Would it have still felt so intimate? Right?
[6924.48 → 6927.48] So there's a limit to what you can do in terms of ticket sales.
[6927.48 → 6929.48] You have to, you have to bring in brands.
[6929.48 → 6933.48] But you know, we wanted to do it in a way that was really authentic and really community driven as well.
[6933.48 → 6937.48] So we're kind of like, okay, so we're going to, we're going to bring in the audience.
[6937.48 → 6940.48] We're going to bring in other creators, and we're going to bring in brands.
[6940.48 → 6944.48] And then, and then what happened at 2019 was the creators all started like now.
[6944.48 → 6950.48] The creators all started like networking with each other and the audience started networking with them and the brands networked with creators, and they networked with the audience.
[6950.48 → 6952.48] And it became this like super cool thing.
[6952.48 → 6955.48] And we had all this momentum and then the world got sick.
[6955.48 → 6958.48] And I'm, I'm really, I'm really happy.
[6958.48 → 6967.48] I'm really excited to see that four years later it's managed to, it seems to me still be that, but bigger and better and awesome.
[6967.48 → 6969.48] So I guess, I don't know. I wouldn't.
[6969.48 → 6987.48] I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't really think I would change anything other than, you know, just try and make it better.
[6987.48 → 6997.48] Try and try and have the POS terminals have no connectivity issues and, you know, try and make the lines shorter and, and, and like go wider, you know, go, go, go broader.
[6997.48 → 6999.48] Go more whale.
[6999.48 → 7001.48] Yeah. It's like all this natural progression stuff.
[7001.48 → 7003.48] I don't think there's anything major that it's missing.
[7003.48 → 7008.48] It's just, yeah, nah, I think LTX stays here.
[7008.48 → 7017.48] Something that I think would be like a pretty crazy milestone is once one of the buildings can't properly contain us, and we have to take both.
[7017.48 → 7019.48] That'll be like a pretty big moment.
[7019.48 → 7020.48] Pretty big moment.
[7020.48 → 7021.48] We made it.
[7021.48 → 7022.48] Yeah.
[7022.48 → 7023.48] Yeah.
[7023.48 → 7025.48] Cause you know, packs, they have more than one building.
[7025.48 → 7027.48] So, okay.
[7027.48 → 7029.48] So here's a here's an on the spot question.
[7029.48 → 7030.48] Uh oh.
[7030.48 → 7032.48] And I, I don't think you have to actually answer it.
[7032.48 → 7033.48] Okay.
[7033.48 → 7034.48] Then I won't.
[7034.48 → 7036.48] But I'm wondering what the vibe check is right now.
[7036.48 → 7040.48] Because leading up to the event every single time.
[7040.48 → 7041.48] Oh, you're really going to do this?
[7041.48 → 7042.48] I'm going to do this.
[7042.48 → 7044.48] Leading up to the event every single time.
[7044.48 → 7047.48] It's, you know, it's actually really expensive.
[7047.48 → 7049.48] We make less off of this than you would think.
[7049.48 → 7051.48] All of a sudden I'm just like.
[7051.48 → 7054.48] Opportunity cost of LTX is extremely high.
[7054.48 → 7055.48] Yes.
[7055.48 → 7056.48] So there's that.
[7056.48 → 7057.48] And it's really difficult.
[7057.48 → 7061.48] And like it, it creates a bunch of short weeks, which is hard for production.
[7061.48 → 7065.48] And like things are really hard, but now you're here.
[7065.48 → 7070.48] And I do tend to find that there's the negativity dip and then LTX happens, and he's like, yeah,
[7070.48 → 7071.48] let's go.
[7071.48 → 7073.48] So how are you feeling?
[7073.48 → 7078.48] I always, I always have a blast at these.
[7078.48 → 7080.48] It's always really exciting.
[7080.48 → 7085.48] You know, A, it's, it's so cool to see that, you know, every comment, right?
[7085.48 → 7089.48] Like every, every chat message, you know, there's an actual real person.
[7089.48 → 7093.48] And it's hard to feel like that when it's all online, it becomes just numbers, right?
[7093.48 → 7100.48] Like this feels like a lot more people to me right now than the people watching online.
[7100.48 → 7102.48] Just because they're not, they're not there.
[7102.48 → 7108.48] They're not, they're not tangible, but then these aren't, we're not on side monitors for these people.
[7108.48 → 7117.48] Well, tell me in chat, do you feel personally attacked right now?
[7120.48 → 7123.48] But that number, that number online is 1015 X.
[7123.48 → 7124.48] What's here?
[7124.48 → 7129.48] So like theoretically we're talking like this enormous, you know, crowd, right?
[7129.48 → 7137.48] Um, but it's, A, it's so cool that it feels real, and it feels so big, and it feels so connected.
[7137.48 → 7139.48] And then B, it feels so positive.
[7139.48 → 7148.48] That's something that LTS has that I just, I, it's not the same vibe that I necessarily have ever gotten anywhere else.
[7148.48 → 7149.48] And it's not.
[7149.48 → 7151.48] I used to get it from very old packs, but not anymore.
[7151.48 → 7152.48] But it's not just us.
[7152.48 → 7157.48] You talk to anyone, and they're just like, Oh yeah, I like, I'm meeting so many people here.
[7157.48 → 7159.48] And I just, I like, I did all this stuff and it's so cool.
[7159.48 → 7165.48] And, um, I just, it's hard to not kind of fall in love with it.
[7165.48 → 7166.48] Right?
[7166.48 → 7180.48] Not, not to be the sometimes boring business person that I've kind of become, but I think it's also a fascinating and good reminder or show, depending on how long people have been here for certain people on the team of like why we do some of the things that we do.
[7180.48 → 7181.48] Sure.
[7181.48 → 7186.48] You start having these conversations with people in person that are like, this is why I got into this career.
[7186.48 → 7187.48] Yeah.
[7187.48 → 7188.48] This helped me get through various things.
[7188.48 → 7193.48] This got me interested or, or, or got myself and my partner interested in one single subject that we can bond over.
[7193.48 → 7194.48] Gave us something that we're connected on.
[7194.48 → 7195.48] Yeah.
[7195.48 → 7199.48] That lots of different reasons why this community is important to them.
[7199.48 → 7209.48] So you don't have to answer now.
[7209.48 → 7213.48] I will, I will, I will give you the best answer I can.
[7213.48 → 7220.48] Um, you know, until we decide otherwise, the intention is to bring it back next year.
[7220.48 → 7224.48] However, however, we haven't booked the convention centre yet.
[7224.48 → 7225.48] We do need to do a debrief.
[7225.48 → 7228.48] We need to make sure that what we're doing makes sense.
[7228.48 → 7229.48] Yeah.
[7229.48 → 7238.48] And this is one of the reasons these kinds of really hard decisions is one of the reasons that I honestly just don't really want the pressure of being CEO anymore.
[7238.48 → 7240.48] I actually don't want to make the call.
[7240.48 → 7245.48] I would like to, I would like to come, and I'd like to participate if it's something that the company does that makes sense.
[7245.48 → 7249.48] And to be clear, you know, Taken's not going to, I've talked to him about LTX.
[7249.48 → 7252.48] He's not going to come in and immediately go, well, the ROI on this isn't good enough.
[7252.48 → 7253.48] Uh, see you later.
[7253.48 → 7254.48] Right?
[7254.48 → 7260.48] He understands the inherent value of, you know, networking with other creators, networking with the community, bringing people together.
[7260.48 → 7266.48] Um, we just have to make sure that we can do it in a way that is not breaking the back of our team.
[7266.48 → 7277.48] Because that's the that's the other, that's the other really important aspect we have to consider is, you know, everyone talks about how, you know, crunch is bad.
[7277.48 → 7278.48] Right?
[7278.48 → 7284.48] I think we can all agree that whatever industry you're in crunch is a, is a negative thing.
[7284.48 → 7285.48] Right?
[7285.48 → 7296.48] And so what if I told you that I, you can have LTX, but we can't find a way to figure out how to do this without it causing crunch for a significant portion of our team.
[7296.48 → 7298.48] Is that worth it?
[7298.48 → 7299.48] I don't know.
[7299.48 → 7300.48] I don't know.
[7300.48 → 7301.48] It's true.
[7301.48 → 7302.48] And, and it's true.
[7302.48 → 7303.48] There is crunch.
[7303.48 → 7307.48] LTX is really, really hard on a lot of the team.
[7307.48 → 7314.48] So, um, you know, obviously we'd love to try to find a way to make it just easy and smooth and everything goes great.
[7314.48 → 7315.48] And it does.
[7315.48 → 7316.48] It's totally cool.
[7316.48 → 7317.48] Right?
[7317.48 → 7320.48] But man, the logistics, we've got like 6,000 people in here today.
[7320.48 → 7323.48] Isn't that, isn't that, yeah, right?
[7323.48 → 7326.48] It's wild.
[7326.48 → 7329.48] Do you know what 2019 was?
[7329.48 → 7331.48] Do you know the member, the attendee count?
[7331.48 → 7334.48] Um, Chase told me today and I think I see him at the back.
[7334.48 → 7335.48] Is that Chase's silhouette?
[7335.48 → 7336.48] Yeah.
[7336.48 → 7337.48] Okay.
[7337.48 → 7338.48] Uh, Chase, just, uh, give me a no, no, no, you're good.
[7338.48 → 7339.48] You're good.
[7339.48 → 7340.48] You're good.
[7340.48 → 7341.48] You're good.
[7341.48 → 7342.48] But, but was it 2,300 at 2019?
[7342.48 → 7343.48] Is that a yes or a no?
[7343.48 → 7344.48] About 2,300.
[7344.48 → 7353.48] And for attendees today, we had over 4,000 and then plus the plus ones of our staff, which
[7353.48 → 7356.48] is now a significant number of people each gets two.
[7356.48 → 7362.48] So that's like another 200 people plus our staff, which is another hundred people plus all the
[7362.48 → 7363.48] vendors.
[7363.48 → 7367.48] Like we had some brands show up with like 10, 15 people for their booth.
[7367.48 → 7370.48] So we have, apparently it's close to 6,000 people today.
[7370.48 → 7372.48] Um, which is just, it's just a lot.
[7372.48 → 7373.48] It's a lot.
[7373.48 → 7375.48] And, um, we want, we want to do it.
[7375.48 → 7376.48] That's what I'll say.
[7376.48 → 7377.48] We want to.
[7377.48 → 7378.48] Cool.
[7378.48 → 7379.48] Yeah, good enough.
[7379.48 → 7380.48] Okay.
[7380.48 → 7381.48] Yeah.
[7381.48 → 7394.48] Now for something a little bit easier, is there an update on the basement gaming computers?
[7394.48 → 7396.48] Oh, yes.
[7396.48 → 7402.48] Um, one of them is up and running with pool cooling, except it's not because I had to turn
[7402.48 → 7407.48] it off the other day because contractors were coming to redo some of the EX plumbing that
[7407.48 → 7409.48] we did that we didn't do a very good job of.
[7409.48 → 7415.48] Um, and then for the other four, we need to make some significant modifications to, uh,
[7415.48 → 7418.48] a case, and then we need to do it like four more times.
[7418.48 → 7421.48] Basically what I think is going to happen with LTT over the next little bit is we're
[7421.48 → 7425.48] going to borrow a bunch of engineering resources from Creator Warehouse and hope that we can
[7425.48 → 7429.48] blow through some of these really heavy projects that have been sitting on the back burner.
[7429.48 → 7432.48] Like finally gaming minivan part two is coming.
[7432.48 → 7433.48] Yeah.
[7433.48 → 7434.48] Yeah.
[7434.48 → 7437.48] And that's thanks to the engineers at Creator Warehouse.
[7437.48 → 7441.48] A massive shout-out Sebastian who got that one over the finish line because there's just
[7441.48 → 7447.48] so many little things like, oh yeah, we have to design and create a mounting bracket for
[7447.48 → 7449.48] a monitor that goes on the back of a headrest.
[7449.48 → 7452.48] Um, I'm not going to do it.
[7452.48 → 7455.48] So, uh, yeah, so we're, we're, that's, that's the plan.
[7455.48 → 7456.48] That's the plan.
[7456.48 → 7457.48] Yeah.
[7457.48 → 7458.48] Yeah.
[7458.48 → 7464.48] Has Linus or Luke ever shot a gun when visiting the United States of America?
[7464.48 → 7471.48] I mean, you know, we can shoot guns in Canada, right?
[7471.48 → 7473.48] That's, that's a thing.
[7473.48 → 7476.48] Like there's a shooting range in Langley.
[7476.48 → 7477.48] I went with my wife.
[7477.48 → 7481.48] It's like you could, you could go while you're here.
[7481.48 → 7482.48] Yeah.
[7482.48 → 7486.48] In direct response to your question though.
[7486.48 → 7487.48] Yes, I have.
[7487.48 → 7489.48] I visited a shooting range when I was down in Vegas.
[7489.48 → 7497.48] In fact, if you dig through the catacombs of old LTT videos, you can actually find it.
[7497.48 → 7498.48] It's there.
[7498.48 → 7499.48] Yeah.
[7499.48 → 7500.48] I believe it's there.
[7500.48 → 7505.48] I don't think it was ever intended to be published, but during some channel hijack at some point,
[7505.48 → 7511.48] um, YouTube doesn't, doesn't maintain, or at least they didn't use to maintain the private,
[7511.48 → 7513.48] public unlisted status of a video.
[7513.48 → 7519.48] So when you restored all the videos to your channel, it restored everything and just made
[7519.48 → 7520.48] it all public.
[7520.48 → 7521.48] That's how it used to work.
[7521.48 → 7525.48] So if you search for, um,
[7525.48 → 7527.48] Yeah.
[7527.48 → 7530.48] Las Vegas gun range and firearm centre.
[7530.48 → 7538.48] For the remote audience, someone in the someone in the crowd shouted out the exact title.
[7538.48 → 7539.48] Look at that.
[7539.48 → 7543.48] It's Linus with a hilarious Las Vegas hat with flames on it.
[7543.48 → 7544.48] Of course.
[7544.48 → 7545.48] At the gun range.
[7545.48 → 7546.48] Looks like a Hot Wheels hat.
[7546.48 → 7547.48] Yeah.
[7547.48 → 7548.48] It's hilarious.
[7548.48 → 7549.48] So the answer is yes.
[7549.48 → 7551.48] This was me doing it.
[7551.48 → 7554.48] He didn't even tell me to get my elbow in.
[7554.48 → 7555.48] Terrible.
[7555.48 → 7556.48] Terrible for him.
[7556.48 → 7557.48] Yeah.
[7557.48 → 7560.48] I, I have many, many times.
[7560.48 → 7563.48] My, uh, my grandfather was a Marine.
[7563.48 → 7567.48] And when I would go down to visit him, we would go do drills and stuff.
[7567.48 → 7573.48] He had me doing like on the move Mozambique drills in a range that you're only allowed to get into if you have like special access,
[7573.48 → 7574.48] because he had it and all this kind of stuff.
[7574.48 → 7575.48] And it was, it was a lot of fun.
[7575.48 → 7586.48] We did, um, after he passed away, we were down there, and we actually went to the gun range that he used to go to all the time to do a bit of a, uh, a send-off, which was, yeah, that's cool.
[7586.48 → 7589.48] I don't know about that.
[7589.48 → 7593.48] We're both trying to reply to potentials right now.
[7593.48 → 7594.48] Oh, yeah.
[7594.48 → 7595.48] Please do that.
[7595.48 → 7600.48] Hi DLL and LMG team and everyone at LTX.
[7600.48 → 7605.48] Congrats on an awesome LTX.
[7605.48 → 7610.48] Is there a limit on how big you want LTX to grow?
[7610.48 → 7611.48] Linus?
[7611.48 → 7612.48] No.
[7612.48 → 7613.48] Two buildings.
[7613.48 → 7614.48] Yeah.
[7614.48 → 7615.48] Two buildings.
[7615.48 → 7616.48] Three buildings.
[7616.48 → 7619.48] We will buy downtown Vancouver.
[7619.48 → 7623.48] Car-free downtown Vancouver.
[7623.48 → 7628.48] Hey DLL and everyone in the LTX crowd.
[7628.48 → 7634.48] Do you have any tech tips to help with post-convention or events?
[7634.48 → 7637.48] Post-convention or Expo depression.
[7637.48 → 7640.48] I hope everyone has fun for the rest of the Expo.
[7640.48 → 7641.48] Honestly, no.
[7641.48 → 7643.48] I look forward to next.
[7643.48 → 7644.48] We'll see.
[7644.48 → 7652.48] One of the cool things with the prevalence of, uh, Discord, actually, you can, a lot of people at the event have been meeting other people at the event.
[7652.48 → 7658.48] This is something that used to happen when I went to small packs as well, and I've been talking to a ton of people here about that's happening here.
[7658.48 → 7659.48] You're just waiting in line.
[7659.48 → 7661.48] You become buddies with the person in front or behind you.
[7661.48 → 7663.48] Um, just add people on Discord.
[7663.48 → 7664.48] Play games with them and stuff.
[7664.48 → 7665.48] Yeah.
[7665.48 → 7666.48] Yeah.
[7666.48 → 7668.48] The community doesn't have to just be for like two days.
[7668.48 → 7669.48] Yeah.
[7669.48 → 7676.48] And you can, if you stay in contact with that person, you can come back to the next one and reunite that way, and it can be this whole thing.
[7676.48 → 7677.48] It's, yeah.
[7677.48 → 7680.48] It doesn't really have to actually just completely end.
[7680.48 → 7683.48] You could kind of carry it forward and spear it a little bit.
[7683.48 → 7686.48] Hi, LTX.
[7686.48 → 7691.48] The Square Enix FF XIV Fan Fest is this weekend in Vegas.
[7691.48 → 7693.48] One of the sponsors is the Intel NUC.
[7693.48 → 7694.48] That's weird.
[7694.48 → 7697.48] Do you know any other poor timing ads or sponsors?
[7697.48 → 7698.48] Uh, wow.
[7698.48 → 7699.48] Oh, oh.
[7699.48 → 7700.48] That's weird.
[7700.48 → 7701.48] Oh, oh.
[7701.48 → 7702.48] We had, we had terrible timing on a sponsorship once.
[7702.48 → 7703.48] Oh, crap.
[7703.48 → 7704.48] Is Colton still around?
[7704.48 → 7712.48] There, there was a man, there was a situation where, um, we had like a, like a sponsorship deal lined up with someone and then the video was supposed to go live.
[7712.48 → 7728.48] And then like two days prior, something totally catastrophic happened.
[7728.48 → 7731.48] Like they had like a major breach or something like that.
[7731.48 → 7734.48] And we, the, the, sorry.
[7734.48 → 7736.48] Uh, I don't know.
[7736.48 → 7737.48] You know what?
[7737.48 → 7739.48] Realistically, it's probably happened with multiple sponsors.
[7739.48 → 7740.48] Yeah.
[7740.48 → 7742.48] It's, we've been doing this for a while.
[7742.48 → 7749.48] I can't remember, but we've been around the block long enough that, yeah, we've definitely seen some bad timing on sponsorships.
[7749.48 → 7759.48] That wasn't bad timing.
[7759.48 → 7760.48] That was just bad.
[7760.48 → 7762.48] There's a difference.
[7762.48 → 7763.48] That's good.
[7763.48 → 7764.48] Hold on.
[7764.48 → 7765.48] How's the final time?
[7765.48 → 7766.48] Hold on, man.
[7766.48 → 7770.48] Hello, DLL and LDX attendees.
[7770.48 → 7771.48] Woo!
[7771.48 → 7772.48] Woo!
[7772.48 → 7773.48] Question for DLL.
[7773.48 → 7776.48] What is your favourite part of working with each other?
[7776.48 → 7779.48] Been watching this show for years and love every second of it.
[7779.48 → 7783.48] They want us to be so cute.
[7783.48 → 7784.48] Ugh!
[7784.48 → 7787.48] Brutal honesty.
[7787.48 → 7790.48] I can say anything to this man.
[7790.48 → 7792.48] And probably have.
[7792.48 → 7797.48] Luke, your weight loss journey is going great.
[7797.48 → 7798.48] You still have work to do.
[7798.48 → 7799.48] Yeah.
[7799.48 → 7802.48] It doesn't bother me.
[7802.48 → 7803.48] Cause like, yeah, I don't know.
[7803.48 → 7804.48] We'll talk about it.
[7804.48 → 7805.48] And it's true.
[7805.48 → 7806.48] I do have work to do, and I'm working on it.
[7806.48 → 7807.48] It's fine.
[7807.48 → 7809.48] But we have to, you know, you have to, you have to trust each other.
[7809.48 → 7811.48] It's all about, you have to be real, right?
[7811.48 → 7815.48] Like I can, if Luke says something nice to me, it's great.
[7815.48 → 7817.48] Because I know he actually means it.
[7817.48 → 7824.48] Because if he thought that, you know, I was, um, if he thought I was, if he thought I was losing my soul.
[7824.48 → 7828.48] He would tell me.
[7828.48 → 7830.48] He would use those words.
[7830.48 → 7831.48] Yeah.
[7831.48 → 7832.48] Yeah, that happens.
[7832.48 → 7835.48] You know, I think it's important, right?
[7835.48 → 7837.48] Because our relationship is complicated.
[7837.48 → 7842.48] Um, we're friends, we're colleagues, we're, we're boss employee, we're,
[7842.48 → 7844.48] You were my landlord for like five years or something.
[7844.48 → 7845.48] Yeah.
[7845.48 → 7846.48] Like it.
[7846.48 → 7850.48] We, yeah, we have to be able to, we have to be able to be real with each other.
[7850.48 → 7852.48] Otherwise we're all, we're going to be second guessing everything.
[7852.48 → 7854.48] I mean, we've, uh, we've been through it all.
[7854.48 → 7856.48] And then, and then Dan was there.
[7856.48 → 7870.48] I, yeah, one of my biggest pet peeves is not knowing where I stand with someone.
[7870.48 → 7873.48] So like, yeah, basically same answer.
[7873.48 → 7875.48] For Dan, I'll talk about Dan.
[7875.48 → 7876.48] I manage Dan.
[7876.48 → 7877.48] So I'll talk about Dan for a second.
[7877.48 → 7878.48] He's my, they're both my boss.
[7878.48 → 7884.48] I, I, I very much enjoy Dan's general, extremely chaotic energy.
[7884.48 → 7887.48] And just desire to do all the things.
[7887.48 → 7890.48] He's a little distractible sometimes, but he gets a lot of stuff done.
[7890.48 → 7893.48] And he's very excited to do interesting, complicated things,
[7893.48 → 7895.48] which is very fun to work with.
[7895.48 → 7897.48] So I'll give you that.
[7907.48 → 7909.48] Up next is from Jeffrey.
[7909.48 → 7913.48] Linus and Luke, uh, do you have a favourite memory from creating a video
[7913.48 → 7916.48] or working on a special project together?
[7916.48 → 7917.48] Christmas album.
[7917.48 → 7918.48] That's true.
[7918.48 → 7922.48] Hopefully the audience shouted out Christmas album.
[7922.48 → 7925.48] Um, a favourite memory.
[7925.48 → 7926.48] It's happening.
[7926.48 → 7927.48] It's hard to pick one.
[7927.48 → 7929.48] It's hard to pick one favourite.
[7929.48 → 7933.48] We did some really goofy, weird stuff together in the early days.
[7933.48 → 7945.48] Like this is going to seem like probably a, a not very, um, like not that, not that great a moment, but it was, it's one of the ones that I'll always remember.
[7945.48 → 7952.48] Uh, we, we had this, like, I think it was a water gun fight or something like that in the back alley behind the Langley house.
[7952.48 → 7955.48] And I did something to him.
[7955.48 → 7957.48] And it was underhanded.
[7957.48 → 7958.48] I remember this.
[7958.48 → 7967.48] And for the one time in our entire relationship, he looked at me and ran after me in a way that I actually wasn't quite sure if he would hurt me or not.
[7967.48 → 7977.48] I scaled a fence, which I am trying to remember if he pulled me down off of, or if I did get over it.
[7977.48 → 7978.48] I'm not sure.
[7978.48 → 7982.48] But just those, um, I don't know, it was all, it was all so raw.
[7982.48 → 7983.48] It was so raw back then.
[7983.48 → 7986.48] Um, you can't pick one.
[7986.48 → 7989.48] And I know, I know it's cliché, but it's impossible to pick one.
[7989.48 → 7995.48] I've, I've mentioned, I've mentioned mine a bunch of times on the show before, but it was the, the Denny's trip.
[7995.48 → 7996.48] Yeah.
[7996.48 → 8004.48] So there was this, before Linus Media Group was a thing, uh, back when we were at NCI, there was, there was one, I, he had a full-time job.
[8004.48 → 8009.48] I was in school full-time, and we were also full-time making Linus Tech Tips and NCI videos.
[8009.48 → 8011.48] So, like, we were working a lot.
[8011.48 → 8014.48] And there was one time when we went to go get food after work.
[8014.48 → 8016.48] Denny's was like the only thing open.
[8016.48 → 8024.48] We showed up, the, the, like, stewardess, or, wait, stewardess, hostess, and waitress slash person doing both of those things was passed.
[8024.48 → 8029.48] I, if I remember correctly, the chef took, no, she took our orders.
[8029.48 → 8030.48] We, we ordered first.
[8030.48 → 8033.48] Yeah, she, she took our orders and then fell asleep.
[8033.48 → 8036.48] And the chef just left the food, like, under the heat lamp.
[8036.48 → 8039.48] So, I, I don't know if it was just me or both of us.
[8039.48 → 8042.48] At some point, we were just like, this is Denny's.
[8042.48 → 8044.48] How long could this food possibly take to, to deliver?
[8044.48 → 8045.48] Yeah.
[8045.48 → 8047.48] So we just went into the kitchen and got the food ourselves.
[8047.48 → 8051.48] And it was just like the I don't know.
[8051.48 → 8052.48] I don't know.
[8052.48 → 8057.48] If you guys watched how I reacted to the hack, you can imagine how I was kind of feeling at that moment.
[8057.48 → 8059.48] Where, like, this is crazy.
[8059.48 → 8062.48] The stuff we're trying to accomplish is crazy.
[8062.48 → 8064.48] We have no idea if any of this is going to work.
[8064.48 → 8065.48] This is still super early days.
[8065.48 → 8070.48] But we're both committing really, really, really heavily and giving everything we have to make this work.
[8070.48 → 8075.48] And we let the waitress lady sleep, which was also cool.
[8075.48 → 8078.48] It's just the kind of people we are.
[8078.48 → 8079.48] She clearly needed the rest.
[8079.48 → 8080.48] Yeah.
[8080.48 → 8081.48] And like, we can go get it ourselves.
[8081.48 → 8082.48] It's fine.
[8082.48 → 8083.48] Yeah.
[8083.48 → 8085.48] Last couple here.
[8085.48 → 8088.48] You guys are the heart of the tech community.
[8088.48 → 8098.48] How does it feel to have nearly all big tech creators at your expo and nearly all geeks at home, jealously watching, wishing they were there?
[8098.48 → 8099.48] It's exciting.
[8099.48 → 8100.48] It's amazing.
[8100.48 → 8102.48] It's unlike anything, it's unlike anything else.
[8102.48 → 8105.48] Yeah.
[8108.48 → 8109.48] Nice and terse.
[8109.48 → 8111.48] Hello, DLL.
[8111.48 → 8112.48] Timestamp guy here.
[8112.48 → 8114.48] Three away from the big 100 stamps.
[8114.48 → 8115.48] Woo!
[8115.48 → 8116.48] Woo!
[8116.48 → 8117.48] Shout out, Timestamps!
[8123.48 → 8129.48] What was your proudest and junkiest solution to a problem that made everyone was baffled?
[8129.48 → 8132.48] Made everyone baffled, I assume?
[8132.48 → 8133.48] Wow.
[8133.48 → 8134.48] Ooh.
[8134.48 → 8135.48] Ugh.
[8135.48 → 8136.48] Ugh.
[8136.48 → 8137.48] This is a really tough one.
[8137.48 → 8139.48] Why you have to throw us such a difficult one?
[8139.48 → 8141.48] That baffled everyone.
[8141.48 → 8146.48] There's been so many Jacky solutions.
[8146.48 → 8149.48] Using Windows Server for our NAS.
[8149.48 → 8154.48] That was a Jacky solution and it definitely left everyone baffled.
[8154.48 → 8156.48] What about having the NAS on the stairs?
[8156.48 → 8159.48] What about having the hard drive stored above the toilet?
[8159.48 → 8160.48] Oh, yeah, yeah, that's pretty good.
[8160.48 → 8162.48] I mean, whole room water cooling.
[8162.48 → 8163.48] There, you know what?
[8163.48 → 8164.48] That's my answer.
[8164.48 → 8166.48] That left everyone baffled.
[8166.48 → 8167.48] All we've got left here is potentials.
[8167.48 → 8171.48] Do you want to just go through them rapid fire, or shall I read them to you top to bottom?
[8171.48 → 8172.48] Yeah, I think we're trying to text answer.
[8172.48 → 8173.48] I would maybe start at the top and we can power up.
[8173.48 → 8174.48] Sure.
[8174.48 → 8175.48] Sounds good to me.
[8175.48 → 8176.48] There's an app on Google.
[8176.48 → 8177.48] He's doing that one.
[8177.48 → 8178.48] Skip that one.
[8178.48 → 8179.48] What?
[8179.48 → 8180.48] Sorry.
[8180.48 → 8181.48] Skip that one.
[8181.48 → 8182.48] Go next.
[8182.48 → 8192.48] Hey, LL and D. I am currently working on my PhD in processor design.
[8192.48 → 8198.48] I'd guess there are, oh boy, there are lots of other researchers in your audience.
[8198.48 → 8202.48] Would you consider having a forum for researchers at a future LTX?
[8202.48 → 8208.48] Honestly, what I would expect is that you guys would put together your own, like, band of
[8208.48 → 8215.48] merry researchers and kind of connect here and, you know, I, man, like, are we going to need
[8215.48 → 8219.48] like a like banks of meeting rooms for people to like, just like hang out, like hang out?
[8219.48 → 8220.48] I don't, I don't know.
[8220.48 → 8225.48] You know, we'd love for, we'd love for LTX to be driven by the community's needs.
[8225.48 → 8230.48] So if that's something that you feel like it needs, you know, we'd love for you guys to,
[8230.48 → 8234.48] yeah, come in and participate and hang out and meet each other and make connections.
[8238.48 → 8243.48] Hey, DLL and hi, LTX people.
[8243.48 → 8250.48] What are some helpful tips you have for travelling with your tech on trips, business and or leisure?
[8250.48 → 8253.48] Oh, we did a whole video on how to pack your computer.
[8253.48 → 8259.48] As for how to travel with your tech, I got to say, man, I never throw away like a, a velvety,
[8259.48 → 8264.48] like crown royal bag, you know, like a, like a soft bag, man.
[8264.48 → 8268.48] And I, which means he has what, one?
[8268.48 → 8270.48] I buy motorcycle helmets too.
[8270.48 → 8271.48] Okay.
[8271.48 → 8272.48] They also come in them.
[8272.48 → 8275.48] But that's what I, that's why I packed the play button PC in to bring it here.
[8275.48 → 8277.48] I just put it in a motorcycle drawstring bag.
[8277.48 → 8280.48] They've got that nice soft feeling and just as, and yeah, it's not going to get,
[8280.48 → 8281.48] it's not going to get scratched.
[8281.48 → 8282.48] It's not going to get scuffed.
[8282.48 → 8289.48] I mean, I think the biggest one is assumed no matter who you have charged with moving your tech around,
[8289.48 → 8292.48] that they're going to do absolutely everything in their power to break it.
[8292.48 → 8293.48] Yeah.
[8293.48 → 8295.48] And package it accordingly.
[8295.48 → 8298.48] Carry on.
[8298.48 → 8301.48] I wish I could have made it to LTX.
[8301.48 → 8302.48] Maybe next year.
[8302.48 → 8305.48] Luke, when can we download videos from float plane?
[8305.48 → 8306.48] I'm a truck driver.
[8306.48 → 8310.48] I don't always have service and I don't want to eat through my data.
[8310.48 → 8311.48] Thanks.
[8311.48 → 8312.48] Now.
[8312.48 → 8313.48] Yeah.
[8313.48 → 8314.48] Yeah.
[8314.48 → 8315.48] Now.
[8315.48 → 8318.48] Also literally forever ago.
[8318.48 → 8319.48] Fix your UX, Luke.
[8319.48 → 8320.48] Sorry?
[8320.48 → 8321.48] Fix your UX then.
[8321.48 → 8326.48] Oh, they might mean specifically LTX behind the scenes videos.
[8326.48 → 8327.48] Oh.
[8327.48 → 8328.48] Oh.
[8328.48 → 8329.48] In which case, I don't know.
[8329.48 → 8332.48] Maybe we'll look into that and see if maybe downloading is disabled on them.
[8332.48 → 8333.48] Can, is that even an option?
[8333.48 → 8335.48] Oh, the mobile app.
[8335.48 → 8336.48] Oh.
[8336.48 → 8337.48] Oh.
[8337.48 → 8338.48] Oh.
[8338.48 → 8344.48] Like I said earlier, linusmediagroup.com slash jobs apply for the front end position.
[8344.48 → 8345.48] Yeah.
[8345.48 → 8346.48] Yeah.
[8346.48 → 8347.48] Yeah.
[8347.48 → 8348.48] Yeah.
[8348.48 → 8349.48] Yeah.
[8349.48 → 8350.48] Yeah.
[8350.48 → 8353.48] The poor man needs so much help.
[8353.48 → 8358.48] Um, have you heard about the Windows Vista Extended Kernel project?
[8358.48 → 8361.48] It lets the kernel say it's a different version of Windows.
[8361.48 → 8365.48] Do you see a future where an old version continues to get community updates?
[8365.48 → 8366.48] No.
[8366.48 → 8373.48] Um, I mean, it's one of those things where even if it could continue to get some kind of
[8373.48 → 8376.48] updates, you could, you know, continue to run Steam on it, right?
[8376.48 → 8380.48] Because like Steam will not run on very old versions of Windows because Valve will drop
[8380.48 → 8384.48] support even though like, I don't know, technically, yeah, it probably could run or whatever.
[8384.48 → 8389.48] Um, but I just, I just wouldn't recommend it, you know, unless there's a full source code leak or
[8389.48 → 8395.48] something like that for Windows Vista, you're not going to be able to rely on community updates to
[8395.48 → 8397.48] keep it actually safe to use.
[8397.48 → 8401.48] And so I just don't think it's the kind of thing that I can recommend.
[8401.48 → 8404.48] Um, and I, I just, I don't think it makes sense.
[8404.48 → 8407.48] Didn't, uh, the Windows 95 source code leak?
[8407.48 → 8408.48] Was it 95, 98?
[8408.48 → 8409.48] Something like that.
[8409.48 → 8412.48] 2000 leaked as well.
[8412.48 → 8413.48] I don't know.
[8413.48 → 8416.48] I mean, who knows then maybe one day Vista source code will leak, and we will see some kind of
[8416.48 → 8425.48] extension project and, and, and the whole thing will make sense, which would be a really wild alternative to Windows,
[8425.48 → 8427.48] Linux or macOS.
[8427.48 → 8428.48] Yeah.
[8428.48 → 8437.48] I feel like with Windows 2000, there's really a lot of fundamental stuff missing for the internet age that it's not,
[8437.48 → 8447.48] it's not something that you would realistically want to use even if you could, but getting up to, you know, Vista, I know about Vista's reputation.
[8447.48 → 8448.48] Okay.
[8448.48 → 8452.48] But it was not that bad.
[8452.48 → 8453.48] Yeah.
[8453.48 → 8454.48] Yeah.
[8454.48 → 8458.48] Vista fans, Vista fans.
[8458.48 → 8460.48] I don't know an updated Vista.
[8460.48 → 8461.48] I'd use it.
[8461.48 → 8463.48] The way it was rolled out was terrible.
[8463.48 → 8467.48] The laptops that people were putting it on, like companies were putting on was completely not okay.
[8467.48 → 8469.48] The certification for Microsoft was trash.
[8469.48 → 8474.48] The operating system itself, if on a computer powerful enough, was neat.
[8474.48 → 8475.48] When does that change?
[8475.48 → 8481.48] And, I think that, wait, you've got one more in here.
[8481.48 → 8484.48] This is our last merch message from the evening.
[8484.48 → 8491.48] Hey DLL, long time viewer from the Langley House couple questions.
[8491.48 → 8496.48] Is there going to be a Tux Plus plushier from the WAN intro?
[8496.48 → 8503.48] And have you considered doing an LTT themed mini figure like the Lamb or Pizza PC?
[8503.48 → 8508.48] We have actually considered, okay, a Tux plushier.
[8508.48 → 8509.48] I have no idea what they're talking about.
[8509.48 → 8510.48] Okay.
[8510.48 → 8516.48] That, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but for the, oh, oh, oh, oh, in the animation, there's a penguin.
[8516.48 → 8517.48] Yeah.
[8517.48 → 8518.48] Linux penguin.
[8518.48 → 8519.48] On the couch or something?
[8519.48 → 8520.48] Yeah.
[8520.48 → 8521.48] That's not really our jam.
[8521.48 → 8526.48] Some Linux, you know, channel or Linux group of some sort can do a Tux plushier.
[8526.48 → 8528.48] That's their thing to do.
[8528.48 → 8533.48] As for, what was the other, oh, oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[8533.48 → 8535.48] As for like little sketches and stuff.
[8535.48 → 8536.48] Yeah.
[8536.48 → 8537.48] We've had that on the agenda for a long time.
[8537.48 → 8542.48] You know, for us, it's a fine line between wanting to produce what the community is asking
[8542.48 → 8544.48] us for, but also not just manufacturing garbage.
[8544.48 → 8546.48] So, we have some really cool stuff coming.
[8546.48 → 8550.48] I showed this on the tours that I was on, the orcas and the whales.
[8550.48 → 8554.48] We have this cool little like desk lamp coming that looks like a retro computer, and it has,
[8554.48 → 8557.48] yeah, see, they know what's up.
[8557.48 → 8562.48] It's got like a, like a curved screen on the front, and then it's got an LED array behind it inside.
[8562.48 → 8567.48] And so you can just kind of bask in the soft glow of a little tiny CRT monitor on your desk.
[8567.48 → 8572.48] So we have some kind of cool stuff coming like that, but not, not too much.
[8572.48 → 8578.48] We don't want to go out of our way to just make stuff that we know is destined for the landfill sooner rather than later.
[8582.48 → 8583.48] And I think that's it.
[8583.48 → 8584.48] We're done.
[8584.48 → 8586.48] We will see you again next week.
[8586.48 → 8590.48] Different bad time, but the same bad channel.
[8590.48 → 8591.48] Same bad channel.
[8591.48 → 8592.48] Bye.
[8620.48 → 8620.98] you
[8650.48 → 8650.98] you
[8680.48 → 8680.98] you
[8710.48 → 8710.98] you
[8740.48 → 8740.98] you
[8770.48 → 8770.98] you
[8800.48 → 8800.98] you
