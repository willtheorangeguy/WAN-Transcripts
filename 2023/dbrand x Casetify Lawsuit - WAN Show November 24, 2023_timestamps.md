@LinusTechTips Linus at 2:13:13 "I legitimately can't tell if the writers knew absolutely nothing about hacking or knew everything about hacking and we're taking the piss because it is it is it is 0% or it is 100% it is nowhere in between you cannot be that wrong unless you know nothing or you are itentionally wrong"

Blu-ray Featurettes – The Keyboard Cowboys A Look Back at Hackers:

timestamp 00-03-05 Ian Softley Director: 
"Emmanuel Goldstein was sort of known figure in hacking world"

timestamp 00-03-08 Emmanuel Goldstein Hacking Consultant Editor-in-Chief 2600 The Hacker Quarterly:
"I served as a consultant to Hackers which meant basically advising people on what hacker would do, on how hacker would speak, what technologically make sense and what didn’t, and answering questions for any of actors or crew"

timestamp 00-03-29 Peter Chiang Visual Effects:
"Ian want to represent the whole world very accurately so therefore without these people giving you inside in to the world I think that you run risk of representing it wrongly" 

timestamp 00-04-33 Nicholas Jarecki Hacking Consultant:
"Emmanuel said to me you know some people coming I want you to meet and into the city corp center walk Ian Softley, Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie and they said: hey we looking for somebody to help us out understanding what hacking about, you seems cool, would you be interested in coming and see us" 

timestamp 00-51-54 Mark Kermode Film Critic 
"The funny thing if you look now back at the reviews which was really mixt. Some of them say that plot doesn’t make any sense and its ridiculous. But they quite not sure why its ridiculous they just sure it must be ridiculous in the kind of if they looking doctor Who they going You can’t traveling time it must be ridiculous "

timestamp 00-57-08 Mark Kermode Film Critic
"I think the key to what Hackers got right was, it made this world accessible to somebody who didn't understand that world, like me.
But it also click with people who did know about it, you can tell that it was made by people who actually knew what they talking about"
