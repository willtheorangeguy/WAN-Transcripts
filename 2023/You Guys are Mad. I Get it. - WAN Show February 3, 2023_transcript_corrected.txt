[0.00 → 6.32] What is up everyone? How you all doing? And welcome to the WAN show!
[6.32 → 12.12] We've got a great show lined up for you today. No, really it's a great show and I will have no hot takes.
[12.12 → 16.00] I will make no one angry. Our first topic will be...
[17.12 → 18.60] I made you guys angry.
[18.60 → 19.60] And he had hot takes.
[19.60 → 24.32] And there were hot takes and you guys are right to be mad.
[24.32 → 25.84] Yeah!
[25.84 → 29.44] And Luke owes everyone an apology.
[29.44 → 33.76] You have one job. Protect me from myself.
[33.76 → 35.60] Yeah. And you couldn't do it. Nope.
[35.60 → 40.32] Speaking of having one job, YouTube. Your one job. Take care of creators.
[40.32 → 43.04] Share with creators. Partner program.
[43.04 → 48.24] YouTube is shorting creators. Pun intended. We'll be talking about that. What else we got today?
[49.20 → 55.76] Anchor comes clean about Dufy. Do they really? Do they fully? We'll talk about that.
[55.76 → 62.08] Yeah, we will. Also, Microsoft launches new AI enabled Bing and Teams.
[62.08 → 65.92] I don't think anyone could have seen this coming. Certainly not anyone on this show.
[65.92 → 66.64] Nobody.
[66.64 → 67.44] Nobody.
[67.44 → 70.88] We... Oh, you know what we didn't test before the show, Dan?
[70.88 → 71.76] The intro?
[71.76 → 75.20] The intro. Let's see. Let's see. He retooled the whole thing.
[76.32 → 79.76] Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I want to see his face if it doesn't work.
[79.76 → 90.08] Why does this keep...
[90.08 → 92.24] Why are you doing that?
[92.24 → 92.96] I'm not.
[92.96 → 94.64] Oh, you're trying to get this most broken.
[94.64 → 95.04] That's me.
[96.08 → 99.76] The genuine glee on his face when it worked was fantastic.
[100.80 → 107.20] The show is brought to you today by Messi, FreshBooks, and Jump Cloud.
[107.20 → 111.92] All right. Okay. Well, that was mostly fine.
[111.92 → 112.72] Oh, it's automated.
[112.72 → 118.80] Cool. Good job. Let's go ahead and jump right into our first topic.
[118.80 → 124.08] We've got a special guest this week, but he's not joining us just yet. That was a glitch. Don't worry about that.
[124.40 → 128.16] First, I want to talk through a little bit of what's happened over the last couple of weeks.
[128.16 → 131.40] Wait, hold on. He spent a lot of time on this. That wasn't a glitch. You did that.
[131.92 → 133.48] What? No, it was definitely a glitch.
[133.58 → 134.52] You have to be honest.
[134.52 → 136.04] I mean...
[136.04 → 137.00] Integrity is important.
[137.00 → 137.80] I can tell from...
[137.80 → 139.32] That's going to be a topic of the show.
[139.32 → 143.16] I can tell from the chat comments that that was obviously a glitch.
[143.16 → 144.84] I don't know about that one.
[144.84 → 145.24] All right.
[145.24 → 145.80] Fake news.
[145.80 → 154.60] So first order of business, I think, is for me to kind of run through what happened last week.
[154.60 → 155.16] All right.
[155.72 → 158.92] I have self-identified three major screw-ups.
[159.40 → 162.76] Screw-up number one was not watching the video ahead of time.
[162.76 → 170.60] I mean, if we're going to respond directly to someone's comments, yeah, I think it's fair enough that we should probably hear what they are.
[171.24 → 181.00] Number two was framing the segment as responding to a critical callout instead of just framing the segment as further clarifying our React channel plans.
[181.00 → 189.72] I actually think if we had just changed the framing to, hey, we want to clarify our React channel plans further, there's been some concern in the community.
[189.72 → 190.52] Would have been a lot better.
[190.52 → 199.80] I think it would have been fine because there was honestly almost nothing in the segment that really disagreed with, like, anything.
[200.60 → 201.48] Problem number three.
[202.28 → 204.80] So first, I'd like to apologize to Dark Viper.
[206.36 → 207.56] No, no, he's not here yet.
[208.44 → 210.56] First, I'd like to apologize to Dark Viper.
[211.24 → 212.00] Another glitch.
[212.00 → 214.54] Second, I'd like to apologize to the audience.
[215.00 → 222.70] And third, I'd like to apologize to our new WAN show writer who, and this is where I'm going to kick off our segment.
[222.88 → 225.64] We've got the one and only Dark Viper joining us on the show.
[225.98 → 231.98] I'd like to apologize to our writer because I think we're about to start on a spicy note here.
[232.48 → 235.40] I actually think she did a perfect job of summarizing the video.
[235.40 → 239.04] And I know that that's not something that you necessarily agree with.
[239.04 → 242.08] Still need to watch the video anyway.
[242.28 → 242.54] I know.
[242.68 → 242.86] Yeah.
[243.04 → 244.46] But she did do an excellent job.
[246.88 → 248.30] Oh, if you want me to just...
[248.30 → 249.48] Yeah, yeah, jump right in.
[249.54 → 249.96] Let's go.
[250.24 → 250.86] Let's go.
[250.90 → 260.16] I just think the combination of the way that it was phrased, at least the first thing that was said, along with the title, implied that I was, like, attacking you.
[260.16 → 262.18] I was making a drama attack video.
[262.52 → 268.30] And as a person who's being characterized as a person who likes to start drama with creators, and it's not something I like to do, actually.
[268.30 → 270.30] I didn't appreciate it.
[270.40 → 273.94] I realized it wasn't the intent for you to categorize it that way.
[274.02 → 276.44] And you perhaps, as you say, would have changed it had you seen the video.
[276.82 → 278.98] But that's the way it felt to me.
[279.28 → 280.72] And so I wasn't particularly happy.
[281.06 → 281.96] That's totally fair.
[282.06 → 285.96] And I think the problem is that we're not even supposed to read the title.
[286.88 → 289.48] The title in here is just for...
[289.48 → 291.10] To have a title for the topic.
[291.78 → 294.16] We don't actually read it live on the show.
[294.16 → 299.90] So we ended up in a bit of a pickle over the very framing of the segment.
[299.90 → 307.92] Because what's been fascinating to me in the way that I process videos, which I have talked about at length last week,
[308.34 → 316.72] in reading the community's reaction to this entire thing, is how mad people think everybody was.
[316.72 → 326.06] Because when, as far as I can tell, you were never mad, and then I was never mad, and then I don't think anyone was ever mad.
[326.12 → 336.54] Because fundamentally, we seem to agree on just about every point with respect to React content, except the actual definition of React content.
[336.54 → 339.02] At best, I was disappointed.
[339.62 → 344.32] And at least maybe at the moment when rioting, a response to what was happening, maybe I was a bit tiffed.
[344.52 → 347.88] But calling me angry or mad was certainly a stretch.
[349.02 → 355.16] And as I say, in the video itself, towards you talking about what you said about your channel, I was certainly not mad.
[355.62 → 360.76] I certainly still hold the same venomous sort of comments towards Reactors in general.
[360.76 → 365.00] But what you're talking about, what you want to create, doesn't seem to be the thing that I normally criticize anyway.
[365.30 → 368.76] Which is something that I highlighted in the video, and I complimented you a few times as well.
[369.16 → 370.44] Yeah, I've watched it.
[370.92 → 372.18] So I've watched it now.
[372.20 → 372.98] Oh yeah, just don't give me audience mind.
[373.22 → 376.16] Yeah, so that's another thing.
[376.56 → 383.92] It was very interesting seeing how many people were jumping into this, clearly not having watched the first WAN show segment.
[383.92 → 397.56] Your response, or the follow-up WAN show segment, because I sat down on my Saturday, once I'd kind of like chilled out a little bit over people sort of jumping down my throat about this.
[398.00 → 399.96] And I watched the whole thing.
[400.64 → 408.50] And ignoring the lol, didn't watch it, tone, it was just kind of like, yeah, here's our plan.
[408.50 → 417.24] And you were like, yeah, this is their plan, and unrelated to their plan, here are some problems with React content in general, the way that I define it.
[417.38 → 424.46] And then I came out and I kind of went, yeah, this is fair, but as we kind of outlined, that's not really our intention.
[424.92 → 432.14] And hey, I'm really glad that we talked about these things, and here are some ideas for how YouTube could turn this into a less toxic thing for the community overall.
[432.66 → 433.22] See you later.
[433.22 → 441.62] And so throughout all of this, the big problem was A, the framing, and B, the fact that we were like, yeah, we didn't watch it.
[442.66 → 447.10] Even having watched it, I don't actually have a ton more to say.
[447.40 → 450.72] So the main reason that we brought you on the show is just for me to say, like, sorry, dude.
[452.10 → 454.92] There are a few things we can talk about, but there's not actually much.
[455.80 → 458.76] When it happened, I was surprised it got mentioned at all.
[458.84 → 461.02] Like, I think if you'd watched the video, you'd be like, why are we talking about this?
[461.02 → 463.08] Why is this a thing that we need to bring onto the show?
[463.22 → 472.76] Like, as I said before, like, if the segment was just, here are some general ideas that have been floating around about the React channel that we're about to make,
[472.82 → 475.36] and you just talked about it in that context, would have been fine.
[475.62 → 481.52] It's just that you framed it as a response to me, and most of what you talked about wasn't what I talked about in the video,
[482.02 → 484.12] and it was framed as an attack on you.
[484.40 → 486.38] It was just mixed messaging.
[486.66 → 486.84] Yeah.
[486.96 → 487.32] Confusion.
[487.50 → 488.08] Lines got crossed.
[488.76 → 489.52] I got what?
[489.60 → 489.70] Sorry?
[490.00 → 491.00] I said lines got crossed.
[491.00 → 493.08] Oh, I thought you said Linus got crossed.
[493.18 → 493.70] And I was like, no.
[493.96 → 495.56] Because the thing is, I was never even mad.
[496.02 → 502.68] Like, looking at the summary, the first thing it said in my summary was he was generally positive about everything.
[502.78 → 503.20] And I was like, okay.
[503.20 → 506.48] Like, it didn't actually feel like drama to me in the first place.
[506.54 → 509.20] I think we might have just, I was probably just in, like, kind of...
[510.32 → 519.06] So, new writers, new writers, acquaintance, you know, this is an anonymous person, so I'm not going to disclose anything about them.
[519.16 → 521.58] They're still in their probationary period here.
[521.58 → 529.26] So, after 90 days, we start talking about people's names, because otherwise it makes it really awkward if people don't make it through the probationary period.
[529.74 → 534.00] But what they said was, watching it, Linus seems like he needs a nap.
[534.42 → 537.82] And there's no doubt last Friday that I probably needed a nap.
[538.82 → 540.36] It was not great.
[540.36 → 549.28] One thing that I definitely want to address is that you corrected my understanding of the H3 ruling.
[549.42 → 555.04] I had misunderstood why the ruling went that way, so I was really glad about that.
[555.80 → 562.54] And one of the points that I hadn't come across yet was your point about how live streamers haven't vetted the content,
[562.68 → 567.72] so they have no way of knowing whether what they ultimately do will be fair use.
[568.26 → 570.12] And I wanted to talk about that a little bit.
[570.12 → 575.68] That is one of my things that I wanted to kind of, not debate, but maybe try to reach a consensus on,
[575.80 → 580.62] is how do you define, then, vetting?
[581.04 → 591.32] Because this whole situation is actually kind of a fascinating analog for how I would expect our React content to ultimately work.
[591.80 → 597.08] So I, the reactor, would not vet the content, in all likelihood.
[597.08 → 605.04] Because one of the foundational things for me in all of our content is that I like to preserve as much genuineness as possible.
[605.04 → 614.22] So even for something like a fully scripted, pre-prepared video where we're looking at some Xbox development kit or something like that,
[614.86 → 622.52] I will, I'll put on my blinders as I walk past the person's desk who's working on it and go out on my way to not even look at it until I land on set.
[622.52 → 628.08] And when they ask me for guidance about, like, how to prepare it, I'll answer in general terms, and I'll be like, look, don't tell me too much.
[628.12 → 629.42] I don't actually want to look right at it.
[629.44 → 631.80] But yeah, I think that's pretty important or that probably won't be.
[632.18 → 638.10] So if somebody else vets it, where do you feel that lies on the fair use spectrum?
[638.10 → 642.12] Oh, well, they'd still be a part of your team.
[642.34 → 645.82] Like, reaction content can kind of be split into two broad categories.
[646.16 → 653.06] One where it's done after the fact, where nothing is presented to an audience without it already having been seen, edited.
[653.62 → 655.30] You're just using the parts that you need.
[655.56 → 659.48] You come to the other person's content with some specific idea of what you want to create.
[659.64 → 660.34] That's on one side.
[660.52 → 664.48] And there's another side, which is a lot of what happens in live-streaming, where it's just like, are that things popular?
[664.72 → 665.34] I haven't seen it yet.
[665.40 → 666.66] Let's turn it on and see what happens.
[666.66 → 671.64] The first part there has a good fair use argument often.
[671.76 → 673.02] The second part doesn't really.
[673.12 → 677.08] You're not coming to it with a specific idea of how you can create something new, how you can transform it.
[677.14 → 678.68] It's just, this thing's popular.
[679.06 → 679.96] Maybe I say some things.
[680.22 → 681.06] Maybe I don't.
[681.16 → 683.96] And let's just keep watching YouTube videos and let's all be entertained.
[684.30 → 693.08] It's more about the, you know, the bringing together curated content and watching with an audience rather than creating something new from that content necessarily.
[693.08 → 696.32] There's an AIV Tuber.
[696.32 → 699.10] I was just going to ask you what you thought about that.
[699.10 → 699.28] Yeah.
[699.76 → 709.14] And her viewership, well, her, it, whatever, viewership doubled from like 2,500 to 5,000 just by showing random clips.
[709.14 → 714.10] So clearly it's not necessarily just the reactor making something amazing by watching clips.
[714.10 → 726.18] But in your case with a like it would still be curated in the sense that by the time it reaches the audience, anything that's in the video has been specifically tailored to be necessary for what you're creating.
[726.18 → 731.82] Which is not the case with live stream gods or when they get ripped to YouTube, for example.
[731.92 → 737.82] So I would still say that is vetted content in the vein of that first category of reaction content, which is something I don't usually criticize.
[737.82 → 744.58] Like I can tell you right now, the video that we shot right before we recorded WAN Show last week reacting to cringe tech commercials.
[745.44 → 749.96] I hadn't seen the vast majority of them before we sat down to record it, but it was absolutely vetted.
[750.04 → 757.86] It was vetted by someone, and it's going to be edited to only include the parts that we are going to be specifically providing commentary on.
[758.88 → 759.82] And so, yeah, I think.
[760.18 → 761.34] And it's necessary for that commentary to make sense.
[761.46 → 761.92] And so.
[762.14 → 763.22] And you came to it with a specific goal.
[763.22 → 777.44] Well, yeah, so I think it's, I think also it's like their commercials, which from my understanding is any, any content that exists for the sole purpose of promoting a product or service from a commercial entity is pretty much fair game.
[777.98 → 782.82] You know, you guys literally created this only to get eyeballs on it.
[783.34 → 785.72] So if anything, I'm helping you, you're welcome.
[785.72 → 795.98] Which is, which is not an argument that you can make about something that is being created for, for, for personal enrichment and the enjoyment of the audience.
[795.98 → 802.04] Like something like a, like a, like a, like a, like a nonfiction, like a, oh my God.
[802.60 → 803.36] Like a video essay.
[803.60 → 804.46] Sure, sure.
[804.56 → 808.94] A video essay or like a comedy sketch or something along those lines.
[808.94 → 809.24] Right.
[809.24 → 809.66] Right.
[809.66 → 809.78] Right.
[810.12 → 825.22] Now, I think once again, you know, back to, back to my, my whole thing about how the way that I process content is often through reading the comments.
[825.86 → 830.74] Um, I do want to talk about that again.
[830.74 → 834.00] And I know that I'm probably digging myself into a hole here.
[834.86 → 837.36] I did not do a good job of explaining that last week.
[837.36 → 841.32] The main reason why he wants to go over this again is because he's, he's not going to stop doing it.
[841.38 → 842.42] No, I'm not going to stop doing it.
[842.48 → 842.58] Yeah.
[842.68 → 849.04] And the reason I'm not going to stop doing it is that what it does is it distills videos down into what's actionable for me.
[849.46 → 851.14] I don't watch YouTube for entertainment.
[851.62 → 858.46] I only really need to know what the audience's interpretation of the content was.
[858.46 → 876.34] And so whether I look at the original WAN show or whether I look at your video sort of responding to it, or whether I look at our segment on the following WAN show that was definitely responding to it, but also really only framed as definitely responding to it, was more sort of responding to it.
[876.34 → 891.52] The comments actually tell me everything that I need to know as a creator because the nuance of what you said was very likely lost on the viewers who A, weren't paying attention to you, and B, never watched what I said originally anyway.
[891.52 → 899.58] And so in terms of what I need to address in my talking points for my following show, it's their misunderstandings.
[899.90 → 902.90] It's whatever their interpretation of your video was.
[903.24 → 905.36] And so for that reason, I'm sorry.
[905.72 → 906.86] I'm not going to stop.
[907.20 → 913.26] I had a meeting with Riley and the WAN show writer this week when they were like, for the love of God, Linus, watch the videos.
[913.30 → 917.48] And I'm like, yeah, if we're responding to something directly, I will.
[917.58 → 918.12] We'll make time.
[918.22 → 918.90] We'll figure it out.
[918.98 → 919.74] We'll make a way to do it.
[919.74 → 924.14] Or at worst, you guys can put direct quotes in, include timestamps.
[924.22 → 925.44] I can watch the relevant parts.
[925.56 → 928.76] We'll respond to that, and we'll just kind of ignore the rest of it or whatever the case may be.
[929.22 → 929.58] Depending.
[929.70 → 933.78] Like if someone makes a two-hour rant, no, I'm sorry.
[933.78 → 938.52] I'm not going to give you an hour of my time at 2x speed or whatever that works out to you.
[938.52 → 940.78] Usually I can only process about 1.75x.
[941.56 → 945.18] I'm not a seasoned 2x watcher.
[945.18 → 957.02] But that doesn't change the fact that my primary takeaway from a video is almost always the community response.
[957.50 → 964.96] Which is why it was so clear after last week's WAN show, reading the comments under that WAN show, that we had to have you on.
[965.10 → 966.42] And we had to deal with this.
[966.48 → 966.68] Yeah.
[966.68 → 967.62] Because I screwed up.
[967.94 → 968.08] Yeah.
[970.32 → 972.60] So I can say a lot of things in regard to that.
[972.66 → 979.78] But you have, in other cases on this very show, talked about how you don't like people to put words in your mouth.
[980.02 → 985.06] And certainly comments will often put words in the mouth of the person who made the video.
[985.06 → 994.60] And you talked even recently about how you wanted to remove comments that don't finish the video and yet still write a comment and misrepresent what's in the video, don't understand the argument.
[994.92 → 996.46] A lot of comments frustrate me no end.
[996.56 → 1000.68] I'll read my comment section and the person will write like half a page in response to the video.
[1000.74 → 1002.46] And I'll be like, did you watch the video?
[1002.50 → 1003.68] And they're like, no, fuck you.
[1003.88 → 1004.42] Oh, sorry.
[1004.58 → 1004.72] Sorry.
[1005.48 → 1006.88] I think you mean, fuck you.
[1006.88 → 1007.68] It's very frustrating.
[1007.68 → 1012.58] Like I can totally understand the comments alongside the video.
[1012.74 → 1013.20] Because you're right.
[1013.32 → 1015.30] The audience response is quite important.
[1015.42 → 1020.06] But it doesn't often replace the video itself in terms of how it characterizes things.
[1020.34 → 1022.92] Especially my comment section underneath that video.
[1023.30 → 1026.12] Like I've been talking about reaction content for like three years.
[1026.38 → 1029.72] And so the people who've been with me for that long have that wider context.
[1030.06 → 1032.90] And a few comments in the comment section are probably just going to confuse you.
[1032.90 → 1038.06] Why are they talking about all these things when how could that all have been fit into a 20-minute video?
[1038.12 → 1040.62] And they're talking about things that may have happened in a completely different video.
[1040.80 → 1042.08] And you wouldn't have that context.
[1042.24 → 1047.60] And especially if you're not going to watch the video, you aren't going to know how accurate those comments are.
[1047.84 → 1050.56] Are they mischaracterizations of the content in the video?
[1050.66 → 1051.86] Or are they perfectly accurate?
[1053.00 → 1055.62] You know, as you said, it is still important to address it either way.
[1055.86 → 1060.68] But the context of the video seems quite crucial for the comments to make sense.
[1061.04 → 1061.58] Oh, absolutely.
[1061.76 → 1062.12] Sort of.
[1062.12 → 1068.08] So one of the things that reading through the comments on the video actually gave me was a ton of context from your previous videos.
[1068.90 → 1072.66] So it actually that that that knife definitely cuts both ways.
[1072.94 → 1079.06] Because I think if you're is you're responding to something on the show, if you're responding to something officially, you need to actually watch it.
[1079.26 → 1080.36] I think no argument there.
[1080.58 → 1086.36] Arguing that there is no argument to absorbing stuff from the comments is also fair.
[1086.72 → 1086.86] Yeah.
[1086.92 → 1089.34] But just like, yeah, no doubt.
[1089.60 → 1090.72] Where were you last week?
[1092.12 → 1092.94] Saying that?
[1094.54 → 1097.42] I'm pretty sure I disagreed with you on the comments' thing last week.
[1097.50 → 1100.96] But I just like didn't really care much because I don't really care much.
[1100.96 → 1107.02] I know he doesn't really watch YouTube.
[1107.42 → 1108.54] So like, what am I going to do?
[1108.54 → 1111.72] I'm not going to convince him to start watching a bunch of videos.
[1111.92 → 1113.46] He's never watched a lot of videos on YouTube.
[1113.90 → 1115.78] It's always been kind of surprising to me.
[1115.78 → 1121.82] But I have videos and then read the comment section and then on the basis of that determined whether I want to watch the video at all.
[1121.82 → 1125.74] Well, you know, I haven't then, you know, gone on to talk about it.
[1125.74 → 1126.30] Yeah.
[1126.96 → 1127.30] Yeah.
[1127.40 → 1128.78] That's the core problem.
[1128.92 → 1132.34] It's not it's not really so much absorbing stuff that way in general.
[1132.34 → 1133.22] Framing, right?
[1133.36 → 1142.84] So if you were to if you were to then talk about that video and say, let's say Mr. Beast made a video, you know, curing people's blindness.
[1143.16 → 1144.80] Let's say you were to say something like that.
[1144.80 → 1149.24] And, you know, I haven't had a chance to check out the video yet.
[1149.24 → 1154.04] But what's shocking is that the community response is really split two ways on this.
[1154.34 → 1162.76] And it's brought up this fascinating debate about, you know, the medical system, particularly in America and developing countries.
[1163.18 → 1169.56] And, you know, the necessity of, you know, wealthy people needing to come in and heal the blind anyway.
[1169.78 → 1173.32] Like, why is this even a thing versus the people that are just like, this is good.
[1173.38 → 1174.52] Just take it at face value.
[1174.80 → 1178.72] I think you can absolutely have a conversation, but it just needs to be framed correctly.
[1178.72 → 1183.72] It needs to be framed as talking about the community response.
[1183.82 → 1186.36] And you just need to acknowledge that you are not responding to the video.
[1186.80 → 1194.78] You're responding to a rift or a debate that's going on in the broader social media community.
[1195.00 → 1202.68] So I think it's its a combination of things, but it all comes down to there were three clear cell phones and.
[1202.68 → 1204.92] I'm on them.
[1205.40 → 1206.02] I'm on them.
[1206.10 → 1206.50] That's it.
[1206.56 → 1211.28] But I'm also not going to stop reading comments primarily as my way of consuming YouTube.
[1211.60 → 1214.78] That's and that's precisely why I didn't really push back that hard last week.
[1214.78 → 1217.00] It's like it's just he's just going to do that.
[1217.14 → 1217.44] That's fine.
[1217.68 → 1219.42] You don't like need to watch YouTube.
[1219.42 → 1223.28] If you're going to respond to something that's on YouTube, you should watch YouTube.
[1223.28 → 1223.90] But like, yeah.
[1224.18 → 1224.42] Yeah.
[1224.54 → 1225.48] In general, who cares?
[1226.42 → 1237.80] I mean, certainly when I wrote my first essays on reaction content, I did put those essays underneath those videos, specifically for people like you who prefer to read things rather than watch the videos.
[1237.80 → 1239.58] Especially because I was quite proud of those essays.
[1239.74 → 1242.00] But, you know, not going to change the world.
[1242.12 → 1243.48] You can't reach enough people.
[1244.00 → 1244.64] It's, you know.
[1244.72 → 1252.70] No, I think I mean, that's something I do still take issue with, like anyone's perception that I somehow have the power to change this.
[1252.70 → 1263.68] It seems like there were a lot of people in the community that feel like as a prominent creator, I can somehow impact the rising prevalence of React content.
[1263.80 → 1264.98] I really don't think that's going to happen.
[1265.36 → 1279.90] I think this is going to be one of those things like family vlogging where it's going to take like a chain reaction of lawsuits from these kids that grow up and go where the f*** is my money before that entire genre just implodes on itself.
[1279.90 → 1290.36] And maybe it takes a chain reaction of rights holders finally just getting fed up with this and going after prominent streamers in spite of the fact that they're going to face significant community backlash.
[1290.74 → 1292.92] Like, I mean, you wouldn't know anything about that.
[1293.04 → 1294.40] But that could be a total thing.
[1296.08 → 1297.02] They're painful.
[1299.08 → 1306.36] Like, back in 2016, there was a time when reaction content was just like bubbling beneath the surface.
[1306.36 → 1309.84] Like live-streaming certainly hadn't taken off to the degree that it is now.
[1310.38 → 1312.62] So big and there's just so much reaction content on there.
[1312.96 → 1321.10] And so there was a time when a lot of the big creators did band together and go, what are people doing sitting around all day watching other people work hard and then making a bunch of money or whatever?
[1321.20 → 1323.28] And like just here's a popular thing.
[1323.34 → 1324.14] I'm going to re-upload it.
[1324.26 → 1324.84] This is absurd.
[1325.00 → 1327.06] And the community backlash was huge.
[1327.06 → 1330.10] And some of the prominent reactors at the time did bail out.
[1330.82 → 1334.48] What's changed is now like some of the biggest creators are themselves reactors.
[1334.90 → 1343.14] And the more creators who start doing reaction content of any stripe, certainly as I will clarify again, what you're planning to do is not usually what I consider to be reaction content or criticized.
[1343.52 → 1347.56] But that is in the same vein will be seen as a support of this entire ecosystem.
[1347.56 → 1349.46] And it certainly won't help things.
[1349.78 → 1361.32] I don't, I'm not saying that you yourself can steer the boat in a 180 direction, but you do have the ability to influence things, influence the minds of people on basically any topic.
[1361.32 → 1366.22] Like it's just, it would take far more than you to, you know, 180 this boat.
[1366.30 → 1367.22] And I accept that.
[1367.28 → 1368.08] It takes more than me.
[1368.24 → 1374.60] It would take, even Mr. Beast coming out against it probably would have certainly impact, but it wouldn't 180 the boat, you know.
[1375.08 → 1379.92] We're definitely going to be talking about Mr. Beast and his capability for impact later on the show.
[1379.92 → 1390.22] He actually tweeted something yesterday or day before or something like that, that made me just kind of go, man, this is going to be, this is going to be, this is going to be interesting.
[1391.32 → 1393.94] Yeah, well, we'll talk about it a little bit later.
[1394.24 → 1400.06] Let me just see if there's anything else that I kind of, did you have anything else in your notes that you'd wanted to kind of talk to us about or get clarity on?
[1400.06 → 1405.28] The definition of reaction content, you, you seem to like a very broad definition.
[1405.52 → 1406.56] I'm not really sure why.
[1406.96 → 1412.22] Like back, back in the day, like the video I made to you would be considered to be a response video.
[1413.10 → 1413.32] Right.
[1414.28 → 1418.00] Yeah, and, but now I have people in the comment section being like, oh, this is just a reaction video.
[1418.38 → 1420.12] And it's like, my eyes react to the light.
[1420.20 → 1420.82] Are they reactors?
[1420.82 → 1422.52] My lungs react to my need for oxygen.
[1422.60 → 1423.30] Are they now reactors?
[1423.56 → 1432.64] Like this widening of the definition only seems to like to obfuscate things so that people who are doing truly unethical things can be just like, oh, it's all the same at the end of the day.
[1432.80 → 1442.56] But it's not really, you know, as I try and, the first thing I did when I started talking about this topic was tried to distinguish between different types of reaction content and the stuff that I consider to be unethical.
[1443.00 → 1446.08] But you seem to want to be like, no, it's all reaction content.
[1446.08 → 1448.14] I don't think that helps.
[1448.14 → 1451.98] If I can throw in here, I had some thinking about this since we talked about it.
[1452.20 → 1465.06] And I think a lot of the community approaches react content and specifically react, not reaction or reacting, just react content as a filter for types of content.
[1465.06 → 1495.06] 
[1495.06 → 1498.30] You just defined it in a way that no one is currently using.
[1498.30 → 1501.96] I defined it in a way that made it clear what I was talking about.
[1502.46 → 1503.30] Sounds good.
[1504.08 → 1504.76] Look.
[1504.76 → 1505.74] Look.
[1505.74 → 1505.94] I mean, yeah.
[1506.30 → 1508.88] Within that context, I suppose it's fine.
[1508.96 → 1518.20] But then, of course, when my video was summarized using a completely different definition of reaction and that wasn't clarified, it did seem as though I was criticizing.
[1519.20 → 1519.64] Sure.
[1519.74 → 1521.18] Everything that you were talking about, your definition.
[1521.36 → 1530.10] But that's the thing is I didn't really, I didn't really feel, even before I'd watched the video, which I have now, even before I had, I didn't really feel like it was super critical.
[1530.10 → 1536.98] Because all it said was that you were concerned that it was not possible to create ethical reaction content.
[1537.54 → 1539.78] And so I came out, and I said, well, here's how we would try.
[1540.84 → 1542.90] I mean, that's a fair exchange.
[1543.96 → 1544.06] Yeah.
[1544.80 → 1551.06] In part, my objection was more just to the idea of summarizing a video and trying to respond to it.
[1551.74 → 1553.18] That's more than fair.
[1553.54 → 1554.42] We've established that.
[1554.54 → 1555.24] We all agree.
[1555.48 → 1555.64] Yeah.
[1555.64 → 1559.66] There was one comment that Luke made last time talking about.
[1559.96 → 1561.12] Yeah, let's go after Luke for a bit.
[1561.90 → 1562.58] That sounds great.
[1564.14 → 1565.34] It's locking up on Luke.
[1566.50 → 1567.48] Dan, Dan, you're in.
[1567.62 → 1572.96] He questioned how things could be unethical despite there being consent involved.
[1573.14 → 1573.32] Sure.
[1573.42 → 1577.96] And it wasn't actually touched on in the response video I made to you because it is touched on in the other videos.
[1577.96 → 1586.56] But consent doesn't necessarily make something ethical if its people involved under false impression of what value they're getting.
[1587.24 → 1590.46] Or as you did point out that there can be coercion involved.
[1591.00 → 1596.54] The example I like to use is like a person selling a stone for $10,000 that protects you from tigers.
[1596.54 → 1600.62] It can be the case that the person buying the stone perfectly consents to buying it.
[1600.84 → 1604.70] It can be the case that the person selling the stone actually believes the stone protects them from tigers.
[1605.26 → 1607.36] And so that's a perfect consent there.
[1607.70 → 1609.42] They both agree what the stone does.
[1609.62 → 1614.92] But as an outside observer, you still wouldn't think that's an ethical exchange or a good thing for society.
[1615.20 → 1620.64] That someone's selling a stone that doesn't actually work, as far as we're aware, to protect that person from tigers.
[1621.10 → 1622.78] And so that's how I combat reaction content.
[1622.78 → 1626.78] Like I consider reaction content...
[1626.78 → 1640.62] Yeah, I mean...
[1640.62 → 1644.30] Do you want to know why I brought that argument up, by the way?
[1644.52 → 1645.84] Did I coerce you into something?
[1646.02 → 1649.70] No, because I was trying to get you to stop talking about the video that you hadn't watched.
[1652.02 → 1652.56] It's fair.
[1652.78 → 1654.68] People brought up that I did nothing.
[1654.82 → 1656.70] And I'm like, I was doing stuff.
[1656.86 → 1660.44] I repeatedly said we hadn't watched it and then kept trying to bring this up.
[1661.04 → 1663.14] These types of things up, at the very least.
[1664.26 → 1665.28] It just didn't work.
[1665.36 → 1665.86] He was like, no.
[1666.00 → 1667.38] Yeah, you weren't good enough.
[1667.80 → 1668.54] That's the reality.
[1669.16 → 1670.80] I mean, I don't know.
[1670.80 → 1680.20] I think part of where we ended up in trouble, too, was some of the community probably misinterpreted part of your video.
[1680.62 → 1684.32] I have to say, and this is kind of tough.
[1684.32 → 1686.26] I hope you take this in the best possible way.
[1686.26 → 1690.64] There were parts of your video where your point wasn't entirely clear.
[1690.64 → 1698.16] You would use a WAN clip that was not actually related to the point that you were making and then go on to say something.
[1698.16 → 1708.02] So you'd say set up, then WAN clip that actually had nothing to do with the setup, then further clarify some position about React content in general that was nothing to do with the WAN clip.
[1708.06 → 1709.12] And that happened a few times.
[1709.12 → 1710.98] I disagree.
[1711.90 → 1713.74] Well, not entirely, but somewhat.
[1713.90 → 1718.06] The video was roughly cut together, made fairly quickly.
[1718.06 → 1725.00] And I was trying to get out points that were from my notes, a video that I hypothetically wanted to make in the future.
[1725.50 → 1734.14] And so the clips, probably originally when I made the video, probably made absolute, the context was fairly clear.
[1734.14 → 1745.94] But as I cut it further and further down, knowing that I have a hard time getting people to watch a 20-minute video, let alone a half-an-hour video, whatever it was initially, maybe the context was lost.
[1746.14 → 1753.34] I don't think the context was entirely lost, but I do agree that at points it does seem as if the connection was somewhat tenuous.
[1753.46 → 1758.70] If there was a non-critical viewing of it, I think there are areas where it was quite easy to misunderstand.
[1758.70 → 1766.12] Like, for example, you've got a clip where I talk about how it could be used as a way to uplift smaller creators.
[1766.22 → 1769.12] And then you go on to say how it's for business reasons.
[1769.28 → 1776.98] But you also used a clip, like five or six minutes earlier in the video, where I said, right up front, right from the beginning, this is for business reasons.
[1777.48 → 1782.18] But then you proceeded to argue against my argument that it was to uplift smaller creators.
[1782.18 → 1783.74] But that was actually a small sidebar.
[1783.82 → 1785.02] That was more of a happy accident.
[1785.46 → 1786.64] And that was the way it was framed.
[1786.64 → 1793.28] And so if someone didn't watch our original video and only watched your video response, let's call it that.
[1793.38 → 1795.30] Let's use the old school terminology.
[1795.56 → 1806.30] If they only watched your video response, it would seem like you were responding to me thinking that I was some kind of white knight who's going to swoop in and be one of those creators who makes the argument,
[1806.30 → 1816.14] the bigger I get, the bigger you're going to get, and it's going to be great for all of us, which is absolutely never what we set out to do and absolutely never something that even crossed our minds.
[1816.14 → 1818.44] So there were definitely points in the video.
[1818.54 → 1820.04] And yeah, I get it.
[1820.30 → 1828.18] Like, it's not always easy to cut something together perfectly, especially for something that was turned around so fast.
[1828.36 → 1834.38] But after I had watched it, I kind of went, well, I can see why people got this impression.
[1834.38 → 1843.14] I can see why people came away in the comments with this idea because you were actually responding to something that, or it seemed like it.
[1843.52 → 1848.60] Now, I, with all the context that I have, know that that's actually not what you're doing at all.
[1848.78 → 1854.82] You were more, like you said, summarizing the notes that you've been making over the last several months, right?
[1855.14 → 1856.14] With you as a bit of context.
[1856.14 → 1857.76] But that's what it seemed like.
[1858.78 → 1863.38] Yo, I, like, I don't think, did people really come away from that video with a negative impression of you?
[1863.58 → 1864.16] Mostly not.
[1864.74 → 1865.40] No, mostly not.
[1865.40 → 1865.56] No.
[1866.24 → 1872.14] No, I, I, I, I thought enough, I thought enough was in there, especially with the end, although most people don't get to the end of videos, of course.
[1872.62 → 1874.62] But, uh, I, I, I, I don't think.
[1874.62 → 1876.66] Yeah, that's a big problem.
[1876.66 → 1884.68] I, I, I almost didn't release the video because, uh, I do think it wasn't, uh, focused on you enough.
[1884.90 → 1888.22] And a lot of what I talked about in relationship was at the end.
[1888.22 → 1891.12] And I looked at the retention, like the average retention was like 10 minutes.
[1891.12 → 1892.32] I'm like, oh no.
[1893.14 → 1896.04] But that's almost, uh, the problem with any video, I suppose.
[1896.04 → 1897.88] And the problem with reading the comments sometimes.
[1898.26 → 1901.58] So, but no, but the comments were not negative, but they misunderstood.
[1902.10 → 1903.82] That was, that was what I saw.
[1904.10 → 1906.10] So it's, it's fine.
[1906.10 → 1922.32] I think the bottom line is that, yes, I'm using the term react to contain content that would not necessarily be the kind of reaction content that, I mean, I agree with you, is, is a cancer.
[1923.22 → 1925.54] It's, it's, it's a it's a malignant growth.
[1925.66 → 1926.86] It contributes nothing.
[1926.86 → 1937.04] And while I don't necessarily agree with your summary of the creator or attention economy entirely, um, I think it's a, I think it's a little more complicated than that.
[1937.08 → 1939.22] I think you did a pretty good job of dubbing it down.
[1939.70 → 1949.48] Um, but I think if you and I were to have a 90-minute conversation off of this podcast, we could probably get into a lot more nuance about the attention economy.
[1949.48 → 1952.46] And I might go, well, not quite, Matt.
[1952.54 → 1955.24] I don't, I don't necessarily see it quite that way.
[1955.32 → 1958.12] And you might say, but this, and we might come to some kind of.
[1958.12 → 1961.66] You as a content creator have got to understand making things shorter and more digestible and understandable.
[1961.90 → 1962.22] Exactly.
[1962.94 → 1965.74] Um, what was I saying?
[1965.96 → 1966.60] It doesn't matter.
[1966.76 → 1969.14] The point is, I'm good.
[1969.46 → 1970.16] Are you all right?
[1970.78 → 1971.78] Yeah, absolutely.
[1971.78 → 1975.76] Um, and it's, it's been an enjoyable experience coming on the WAN show at all.
[1975.98 → 1979.30] This is a, I wouldn't say it was on my bucket list, but it should have been.
[1980.46 → 1981.76] And you know what?
[1981.86 → 1990.28] I do want to say that you actually popped up on my radar before we did the segment on WAN show, uh, because of your series.
[1990.86 → 2001.20] Um, and even though I hadn't watched any of it, people here had, and as we were putting together sort of our ethical reaction content guidelines,
[2001.20 → 2003.26] uh, you were a guiding star for us.
[2003.62 → 2011.72] So I kind of wanted to pop that on you on the show so that you knew that even though I hadn't necessarily watched the, the video essay series,
[2011.86 → 2017.54] at least, uh, two of us in the exec team already had and had already flagged your concerns.
[2018.14 → 2021.38] Um, some of it is stuff that I sort of intuitively was like, well, that's stupid.
[2021.38 → 2025.44] I just, I just think that's crap content anyway, and I just don't want to do it.
[2025.44 → 2031.34] Um, but other things were just angles, aspects of it that I hadn't considered.
[2031.56 → 2037.94] And so I'm, I'm, I'm really glad you did the series because even though maybe it didn't get as many views as you'd like,
[2037.98 → 2043.06] or maybe it got more backlash than you'd like, or maybe it's frustrating because people are misunderstanding it,
[2043.06 → 2048.54] or whatever all the negatives that come out of it, um, you definitely influenced at least a couple of key people,
[2048.54 → 2054.02] and you've definitely influenced our approach towards it, even if, uh, you know, it might not be perfect every time.
[2054.02 → 2055.76] And we might not agree a hundred percent every time.
[2056.06 → 2060.46] Uh, I think that you made a difference if that helps at all.
[2061.12 → 2062.68] Yeah, that's very kind of you to say.
[2062.86 → 2066.72] Often my biggest issue is not that people disagree with me.
[2066.72 → 2069.94] It's that they don't even take the time to understand my perspective.
[2070.36 → 2074.16] Uh, they don't, they don't watch the video and leave comments being like, oh, you must be wrong.
[2074.16 → 2076.36] Um, I spent a lot of time on that series.
[2076.46 → 2078.72] I spent like two months on it or something.
[2078.86 → 2084.54] And, uh, it, it just frustrates me how many people, uh, paint me as a drama whore or something,
[2084.62 → 2088.62] especially if you, if the context in which that series came out showed that was clean up the case.
[2088.94 → 2092.76] Um, and so knowing, because I have received a lot of messages from creators saying,
[2092.76 → 2095.48] oh, this has completely changed my mind, uh, on the perspective.
[2095.48 → 2097.28] And hearing that it has had some impact is nice.
[2097.44 → 2104.14] It's just, as you say, it's very hard to have, um, like ecosystem changing impact.
[2104.16 → 2108.10] Uh, but it is nice to have some impact, I suppose.
[2108.96 → 2110.54] You've got a lot of fans here.
[2110.96 → 2111.72] Yeah, for sure.
[2112.02 → 2116.68] I mean, if there was anyone that we could have inadvertently sort of beefed with,
[2116.68 → 2119.70] um, it seems like you were not a good choice.
[2120.40 → 2120.92] Yeah.
[2122.92 → 2127.84] Yeah, I, I have, I, I don't, uh, engage with that many content creators in general,
[2127.84 → 2131.56] but it has seemed that most of that engagement has been accidental beef.
[2131.56 → 2134.14] So maybe I am partly to blame as well.
[2134.50 → 2135.44] I wasn't going to say it.
[2135.44 → 2136.20] I wasn't going to say it.
[2136.84 → 2142.30] I, I want to say I'm, I did allude to at least someone in a joking manner that your writer may not like me.
[2142.42 → 2143.42] That was a little bit of a joke.
[2143.62 → 2146.32] I want to apologize if I caused the writer any undue stress.
[2146.76 → 2148.04] Um, I think they're all right.
[2148.38 → 2149.48] Yeah, I think they're all right.
[2149.58 → 2149.70] Yeah.
[2149.70 → 2150.90] I think, I think they're all right.
[2150.90 → 2151.16] Just to be clear.
[2151.66 → 2153.90] I probably caused more stress than, than you did.
[2154.18 → 2162.12] Uh, but I, by, by mid-Saturday, I had basically sent out heartfelt apologies to everyone on our side who I had wronged in any way.
[2162.12 → 2164.90] Um, and based and said like, look, let's fix this.
[2164.94 → 2165.70] Let's move forward.
[2165.92 → 2168.54] So I think, I think that's pretty much it.
[2168.58 → 2171.04] I think it's time for us to move forward with the rest of the show.
[2171.04 → 2173.30] Uh, thank you so much for coming on.
[2173.42 → 2175.04] Uh, really appreciate it.
[2175.22 → 2183.60] Glad we got a chance to kind of bury the hatchet and, and get this at least to a point where we might not agree about what exactly react content is,
[2183.60 → 2190.78] but I think we can agree about what ethical content might look like in some kind of React averse.
[2191.62 → 2192.28] Yeah, absolutely.
[2192.38 → 2193.18] Thank you for having me on.
[2193.32 → 2196.04] And seeing the behind the scenes was very fascinating as well.
[2196.08 → 2197.26] People are definitely missing out.
[2199.46 → 2200.08] All right.
[2200.12 → 2200.94] Thank you very much.
[2201.02 → 2203.88] Take care and have a good day, mate.
[2204.54 → 2204.76] Yeah.
[2204.76 → 2205.72] Because it's morning, right?
[2206.56 → 2206.96] Yes.
[2207.00 → 2207.22] Yes.
[2207.26 → 2209.32] Oh, it's just gone to afternoon, but close enough.
[2209.50 → 2209.86] Oh yeah.
[2210.00 → 2211.24] Dan, you screwed up.
[2211.24 → 2212.84] You put his camera in upside down.
[2213.60 → 2215.36] This whole time I didn't even notice.
[2215.38 → 2215.94] I knew I forgot something.
[2216.54 → 2219.92] You left on the Southern Hemisphere, uh, uh, correction.
[2220.24 → 2221.36] It's not supposed to, okay, anyway.
[2221.46 → 2221.86] All right.
[2221.90 → 2222.26] See you later.
[2222.56 → 2222.94] See ya.
[2224.88 → 2225.52] All right.
[2225.94 → 2228.62] Why don't we jump into our next big topic of the day?
[2228.70 → 2230.60] Luke, what do you want to talk about then?
[2230.92 → 2231.92] Oh, wow.
[2231.94 → 2233.00] Why don't you pick something?
[2233.18 → 2233.90] Uh, anchor.
[2234.74 → 2235.74] You want to talk about anchor?
[2235.94 → 2236.22] Yeah.
[2236.74 → 2237.14] All right.
[2237.24 → 2238.28] Because I'm still mad.
[2238.40 → 2239.26] Let's talk about anchor.
[2239.26 → 2242.74] Well, you're, you're, you're colouring the, the people's perspective, perception.
[2242.74 → 2245.02] You got to let them decide for themselves.
[2245.58 → 2245.84] No.
[2246.02 → 2246.20] Yeah.
[2246.24 → 2247.70] I'm pissed off too, but like, we got-
[2247.70 → 2249.44] They can, they can have the right opinion.
[2249.80 → 2252.38] Uh, okay.
[2253.38 → 2255.30] And I'm the one with the ego.
[2255.96 → 2257.58] I'm the one with the problem.
[2257.78 → 2258.72] I think that's still true.
[2258.72 → 2263.72] Anyway.
[2263.72 → 2263.92] Anyway.
[2265.78 → 2270.10] Since whistleblowers revealed serious security flaws last November, journalists have been
[2270.10 → 2271.10] demanding answers.
[2271.74 → 2276.34] After a long series of fibs, inaccuracies, and omissions, anchor has finally acknowledged
[2276.34 → 2282.30] that the footage on Dufy security cameras was not, as they claimed, natively end-to-end
[2282.30 → 2282.72] encrypted.
[2282.88 → 2283.70] It wasn't.
[2283.94 → 2284.44] What?
[2284.62 → 2285.38] No way.
[2285.50 → 2286.00] No.
[2286.00 → 2286.64] Amazing.
[2287.24 → 2292.06] They now claim that they have addressed the issue with the Dufy web portal that made unencrypted
[2292.06 → 2297.94] camera live streams accessible without authentication, and will be updating every Dufy camera to default
[2297.94 → 2300.48] and end-to-end encryption via WebRTC.
[2301.54 → 2307.04] They state that only one device, the video doorbell dual, was sending and storing information
[2307.04 → 2309.82] on Dufy's cloud without user initiation.
[2310.00 → 2310.82] Which is too much.
[2311.04 → 2311.28] It doesn't matter.
[2311.96 → 2312.52] Exactly.
[2312.52 → 2319.02] One is too many when you say it doesn't happen at all, but carry on, Mr. Cafetière.
[2319.24 → 2322.06] We were both interjecting to say the same things, like, hold on a minute!
[2322.56 → 2323.40] That's irrelevant.
[2324.28 → 2330.18] According to their statement, this was a copy of a setup image for facial recognition in
[2330.18 → 2334.02] case the user added a device or replaced their existing device.
[2334.42 → 2335.48] I don't care.
[2335.48 → 2340.22] They admitted that this was not in line with their local storage mission, and the process
[2340.22 → 2341.16] has been removed.
[2341.60 → 2345.24] They stressed that no facial recognition data was included, and that they have no access
[2345.24 → 2350.78] to users' footage while using local storage and no access to users' biometric data whatsoever.
[2351.42 → 2351.82] Sure.
[2352.58 → 2353.86] Yeah, see, that's the problem.
[2354.12 → 2361.94] This isn't about how the hardware works, or what the policy is, or anything.
[2362.02 → 2365.08] And they've already lied, like, multiple times, so none of their statements have any value.
[2365.08 → 2368.62] It's about, do I believe you at all?
[2368.72 → 2368.90] Yeah.
[2369.78 → 2370.28] Go on.
[2370.68 → 2370.82] Yeah.
[2371.26 → 2376.62] Anchor has apologized for poor communication, good, and confirmed plans to create a bug bounty
[2376.62 → 2377.22] program.
[2378.08 → 2379.24] Okay, now tell me something.
[2379.80 → 2381.08] Did you read the statement?
[2382.60 → 2383.36] The statement?
[2383.56 → 2384.72] Yeah, that Anchor released.
[2384.80 → 2385.12] Oh, no.
[2385.42 → 2386.32] Okay, then I'm ahead of you.
[2386.38 → 2387.02] I read the statement.
[2387.02 → 2390.16] I didn't just read the comments on it, but I did read those as well.
[2391.72 → 2392.94] Are you going over it now?
[2393.08 → 2397.40] It specifically, explicitly is not an apology.
[2397.66 → 2398.30] I'm not surprised.
[2398.74 → 2400.10] Because that's what they did last time, too.
[2400.64 → 2401.84] But they actually...
[2401.84 → 2402.52] I read the last one.
[2402.56 → 2403.38] No, it's bizarre.
[2403.64 → 2407.44] Like, they go out of their way to say, this is not an apology.
[2407.44 → 2411.24] We will apologize later.
[2413.72 → 2414.52] That's weird.
[2415.64 → 2417.22] So, okay.
[2417.54 → 2418.44] If I were to take...
[2418.44 → 2419.44] If I were to take...
[2419.44 → 2420.68] That's super weird.
[2420.74 → 2423.36] Like, if I were to take the statement at face value, okay?
[2423.56 → 2429.88] It seems like they want to get all their ducks in a row and provide the whole story alongside
[2429.88 → 2431.76] a heartfelt apology.
[2431.76 → 2436.30] But from my point of view, it looks like legal butt covering.
[2436.94 → 2442.58] That's the only reason that I can see, from a corporate standpoint, not to apologize.
[2442.58 → 2448.28] Because an apology is an implicit admission of guilt, of wrongdoing.
[2448.44 → 2450.44] Not as much in Canada, which is why we say sorry a lot.
[2450.54 → 2455.80] If they apologize, they're basically saying, we did something wrong.
[2455.80 → 2461.96] Whereas if they don't apologize, if they specifically say, we're not apologizing, but we'll apologize
[2461.96 → 2465.98] later once we've got everything figured out, they're basically just stalling.
[2466.82 → 2469.70] Geepo839 in Float plane Chat said, this is not an apology.
[2469.98 → 2470.80] It's just a tribute.
[2473.06 → 2474.66] Which is a very good reference.
[2475.30 → 2475.84] I approve.
[2476.04 → 2477.02] I approve this tribute.
[2477.68 → 2479.04] Yeah, that sucks.
[2479.22 → 2479.98] That sucks a lot.
[2480.22 → 2482.80] At this point, like, we're going to get...
[2482.80 → 2484.08] I'm going to skip the last couple notes.
[2484.08 → 2485.48] We're going to go right into the discussion question.
[2485.48 → 2489.58] What will Anchor need to do in order for the community at large to accept their apology?
[2489.72 → 2490.74] Can we ever trust them again?
[2491.72 → 2495.02] Massive, like, brutalizing leadership change?
[2495.22 → 2501.22] Like, I can't imagine the thing that steered this ship so far I would ever trust again.
[2501.70 → 2501.88] Yeah.
[2502.28 → 2504.28] Yeah, I mean, I think that's...
[2504.28 → 2505.70] But then, here's the thing.
[2506.40 → 2511.92] If they told you that everyone responsible has been axed, would you even believe them?
[2512.12 → 2513.00] Yeah, I don't know.
[2513.00 → 2516.82] Like, the problem is not even that they lied.
[2517.22 → 2518.54] That's part of the problem.
[2518.66 → 2519.24] That's...
[2519.24 → 2526.74] The problem is that they lied and lied again and lied about lying and lied some more.
[2527.38 → 2530.14] And then, finally, when they absolutely...
[2530.14 → 2531.14] Said they would apologize later.
[2531.18 → 2532.68] Had their back to the wall.
[2533.80 → 2534.82] They said,
[2534.98 → 2538.22] We're sorry that you're upset.
[2538.66 → 2544.22] We'll apologize once we're sure if we did anything wrong.
[2544.22 → 2546.16] And what it was.
[2546.50 → 2548.52] And that will happen...
[2548.52 → 2548.92] Later.
[2550.48 → 2552.32] The f*** are you talking about?
[2552.74 → 2553.32] You don't...
[2553.32 → 2553.34] Ridiculous.
[2554.12 → 2555.28] When you do something...
[2555.28 → 2556.58] Like, okay, imagine this.
[2556.64 → 2557.54] When you do something wrong...
[2557.54 → 2558.32] Sorry, I need to...
[2558.32 → 2561.26] I need to take stock of what exactly...
[2561.26 → 2562.28] I need to review the footage.
[2562.52 → 2563.14] ...happened there.
[2563.24 → 2564.00] Yeah, I need to...
[2564.00 → 2565.36] I'm going to have to check the...
[2565.36 → 2566.82] I'm going to have to read the comments.
[2567.44 → 2571.98] And see if people think that I was in the wrong or your arm shouldn't have been there.
[2572.88 → 2574.94] I'll get back to you later with an apology.
[2575.18 → 2575.88] Elbow gate two.
[2576.02 → 2576.88] What is that?
[2577.96 → 2578.24] That's...
[2578.24 → 2579.24] That's stupid.
[2579.54 → 2579.84] Yeah.
[2580.06 → 2584.88] If you actually own that you did something wrong, you apologize right away.
[2584.96 → 2585.58] You don't wait.
[2586.98 → 2588.86] So I don't think there's much else to say here.
[2588.90 → 2591.00] I mean, we can put up a poll if you really want.
[2591.02 → 2591.78] So wacky.
[2592.08 → 2595.96] Realistically, I can tell you from my point of view, we are not taking Anchor back as a sponsor.
[2595.96 → 2597.72] As a business collaborator.
[2597.82 → 2598.42] It's not happening.
[2598.70 → 2601.68] And I don't know if this is true, but I'm going to assume it was true.
[2601.78 → 2603.96] There was probably an opportunity for that to happen.
[2604.18 → 2604.60] Well, yeah, of course.
[2604.60 → 2605.44] But the ship has sailed.
[2605.66 → 2609.64] Well, yeah, the ship sailed the second that the security researcher said,
[2609.86 → 2610.96] Hey, guys, this...
[2611.70 → 2612.96] And they didn't immediately go,
[2613.82 → 2614.74] Holy crap.
[2615.34 → 2616.54] We're going to fix this.
[2617.00 → 2617.44] Sorry.
[2618.24 → 2619.08] Massive oversight.
[2619.32 → 2620.02] Big patch.
[2620.32 → 2620.92] Yeah, yeah.
[2621.06 → 2621.52] Boo-boo-boo.
[2621.68 → 2625.48] Even if that was a lie, it would have been the correct lie.
[2625.48 → 2629.82] I won't say anything is the right lie, because there's no right lie.
[2629.94 → 2631.42] But there is a correct lie.
[2631.60 → 2633.62] But they couldn't even play the game.
[2633.88 → 2634.70] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2634.90 → 2636.30] They couldn't even pretend.
[2637.32 → 2639.84] They're just like, nope, nope.
[2640.84 → 2647.36] If you don't want to be associated with the CCP, don't act like them.
[2648.74 → 2650.02] Yeah, yeah.
[2650.36 → 2652.56] Because that's the reality, right?
[2652.58 → 2652.98] That's fair enough.
[2652.98 → 2661.46] Like, from a certain point of view, yes, okay, every Chinese corporation has some pressure on them from the CCP.
[2661.70 → 2665.10] But that doesn't mean you have to actually behave just like them.
[2666.06 → 2668.48] When you're caught lying, you just lie more.
[2669.48 → 2670.32] And I don't get it.
[2671.06 → 2674.02] Is there, like, something in the water in, like, Russia-China region?
[2674.02 → 2680.10] Like, just, I mean, not that, frankly, Western leadership lies that much less.
[2680.36 → 2681.56] I mean, that's politicians, I guess, right?
[2681.56 → 2683.44] Or less at all, to be completely honest.
[2683.80 → 2687.38] I guess it's just, it's like the bald-faced ness of it, you know?
[2687.38 → 2691.90] Like, they're not even giving me any respect whatsoever.
[2692.38 → 2694.74] They're going, I didn't do that.
[2695.48 → 2696.04] Right?
[2696.42 → 2697.60] You can't prove I did it.
[2697.74 → 2697.98] Yeah.
[2698.18 → 2701.68] I mean, at least give me something plausible.
[2702.28 → 2703.42] I'm sorry.
[2703.50 → 2707.16] I have a rare condition that causes muscle spasms.
[2707.16 → 2712.96] Yeah, it's like Tourette's, but for physical violence, like, I just, you know.
[2712.98 → 2713.64] Isn't that a thing?
[2713.76 → 2717.50] Actually, I mean, I doubt so extreme that you would, like, hit people.
[2718.78 → 2721.16] But, like, it's...
[2721.16 → 2722.00] I don't know.
[2722.14 → 2725.60] At least make up something plausible, you know?
[2726.32 → 2727.26] Help me out here.
[2728.20 → 2728.46] Yeah.
[2729.48 → 2731.20] Yeah, I think that's pretty straightforward.
[2731.44 → 2733.30] Should we jump into a more positive one?
[2733.90 → 2734.20] Yeah.
[2734.20 → 2735.68] Because I think this is actually pretty good.
[2735.88 → 2736.76] YouTube Shorts.
[2737.88 → 2738.48] You know?
[2738.74 → 2739.90] You think this is good?
[2740.16 → 2741.22] Because I'm mad.
[2741.42 → 2741.62] Oh.
[2742.44 → 2743.22] You go ahead.
[2743.46 → 2744.06] No, hit me.
[2744.16 → 2744.38] Hit me.
[2744.44 → 2744.78] Let's go.
[2744.90 → 2748.20] YouTube has rolled out revenue sharing for Shorts as of February 1st.
[2748.20 → 2753.54] Rather than attaching ads to specific videos, YouTube will pool the revenue from ads that
[2753.54 → 2755.84] appear in the Shorts feed.
[2756.44 → 2762.28] That pool is then split into a pool for fees and music licensing and a pool for creators.
[2762.94 → 2763.30] Oh.
[2763.30 → 2764.22] No, no, that's fine.
[2764.38 → 2764.80] That's fine.
[2764.80 → 2767.08] Because this is the way to combat TikTok.
[2767.58 → 2774.34] TikTok is just going to not respect copyright and not pay anything to license holders.
[2775.14 → 2779.78] And realistically, anyone operating in this hemisphere is not going to be able to get
[2779.78 → 2780.38] away with that.
[2780.54 → 2780.70] Yeah.
[2780.70 → 2784.44] So this is the way to make it so that Shorts can contain copyrighted music.
[2784.56 → 2788.70] So you can actually have like clips from Rihanna and Drake, Taylor Swift, like whatever else,
[2789.12 → 2794.28] so that you can upload the same content to YouTube Shorts that you could to TikTok.
[2794.28 → 2798.84] And unlike TikTok, YouTube is actually going to share some of the revenue from that.
[2798.90 → 2803.62] So now that there's no huge disadvantage, other than TikTok's creation tools, but hopefully
[2803.62 → 2804.20] they'll catch up.
[2804.46 → 2808.26] So now that there's no huge disadvantage in your content, like you can't have music or
[2808.26 → 2812.30] whatever, hopefully there'll be a big migration to Shorts, which should be more profitable
[2812.30 → 2815.58] and or force TikTok to actually compensate creators.
[2815.66 → 2818.14] So overall, everything you've said so far is good.
[2818.14 → 2822.14] I don't think I scrolled down far enough earlier when I was skimming through this to see the
[2822.14 → 2823.14] caveat section.
[2823.56 → 2824.64] Some of that is BS.
[2824.78 → 2825.52] We'll get there in a second, though.
[2825.94 → 2828.82] I just read the first three bits and I thought it was actually really cool.
[2829.02 → 2835.80] Anyway, Shorts that use one music track will be taxed 50% of their views, the ad revenue
[2835.80 → 2839.56] for which is then paid to rights holders of said music.
[2839.82 → 2844.58] YouTube then takes 55% of the cut of the remaining ad revenue.
[2844.58 → 2848.96] And finally, the rest is split among eligible creators based on views.
[2849.16 → 2856.56] In summary, if YouTube Shorts makes just say $100 to make this easy in ad revenue and 20%
[2856.56 → 2858.12] of those shorts use a song.
[2858.28 → 2861.72] So remember, if it uses a song, it's 50% of the views.
[2861.90 → 2865.24] But let's say only 20% of the shorts actually used a song.
[2865.40 → 2867.64] Then the music industry gets 10 bucks.
[2868.10 → 2873.18] YouTube gets 49.50 and the creators split $40.50.
[2874.58 → 2876.84] There are some important caveats, though.
[2877.58 → 2882.56] A lot of this is based around the ad not playing before your specific video, right?
[2882.62 → 2884.58] So it assumes you're in the Shorts feed.
[2885.92 → 2886.18] Okay.
[2886.90 → 2891.02] YouTube doesn't count views from outside said Shorts feed.
[2891.84 → 2895.62] For example, if a viewer clicks on a short from a creator's library, not counted.
[2896.66 → 2897.34] What?
[2897.74 → 2898.14] What?
[2898.14 → 2905.82] YouTube also doesn't share revenue from ads on navigation pages leading to Shorts or the
[2905.82 → 2910.66] first ad that plays in the Shorts feed if it comes before the first video.
[2911.44 → 2912.00] What?
[2912.16 → 2912.48] What?
[2913.30 → 2915.34] We asked a representative from YouTube.
[2915.48 → 2915.96] We did.
[2916.06 → 2917.14] And the apparent logic...
[2917.14 → 2919.26] More than one representative from YouTube, actually.
[2919.74 → 2929.12] Because YouTube has asked me, respectfully, to not just go live and make a video and crap
[2929.12 → 2931.64] on their policies and procedures and business...
[2931.64 → 2932.58] And we did it anyway?
[2932.58 → 2938.26] Without at least giving them a chance to talk me down.
[2939.26 → 2940.94] Without at least giving them a chance to not do anything.
[2941.02 → 2948.46] So I said, hey, this isn't going to change anything because realistically, I've seen the
[2948.46 → 2949.70] pattern over and over again.
[2949.92 → 2954.08] I don't get attention unless I make a bunch of noise publicly.
[2954.36 → 2955.30] But I'll tell you what.
[2955.56 → 2956.36] I'll play along.
[2956.36 → 2958.24] I will go through the...
[2958.24 → 2962.82] I'll go through the chain of command and I will raise my concerns with all the appropriate
[2962.82 → 2970.94] people before I go live with a denouncement of your extremely crappy, two-faced approach
[2970.94 → 2972.62] to revenue sharing in Shorts.
[2973.24 → 2973.98] So I did.
[2974.08 → 2975.20] It did nothing.
[2975.54 → 2975.76] Yep.
[2975.92 → 2976.92] And so we're talking about it.
[2977.12 → 2977.28] Yeah.
[2977.56 → 2978.72] So that was a big waste of time.
[2978.84 → 2980.80] I think next time, YouTube, I won't bother.
[2981.78 → 2983.50] Because it was clearly a waste of time.
[2983.56 → 2984.86] You guys are obviously wrong.
[2984.86 → 2988.16] You guys are obviously being disingenuous here.
[2988.66 → 2990.28] And it didn't matter.
[2990.70 → 2991.68] Because you don't care.
[2992.08 → 2995.72] Because I actually don't know what makes you care.
[2995.82 → 3002.24] And this is an extremely dangerous step from my point of view.
[3002.44 → 3006.88] I don't know what is going on with YouTube leadership right now.
[3007.10 → 3008.86] Because Google somehow...
[3009.62 → 3011.68] And it almost feels like by accident.
[3011.68 → 3022.16] Google has somehow managed to be the one company that has successfully figured out the key to
[3022.16 → 3023.60] retaining their creators.
[3023.98 → 3030.34] To maintaining those relationships and building a library of content that you guys come back
[3030.34 → 3032.90] to the site for time and time and time again.
[3032.90 → 3035.90] They're also the refuge for other dying platforms.
[3036.82 → 3038.42] Vine dies, they come here.
[3038.68 → 3041.98] An equitable revenue sharing approach.
[3042.94 → 3047.00] And this is the first time that I've looked at something and gone,
[3047.30 → 3052.96] well, that was obviously, clearly something that should have been shared with creators.
[3053.16 → 3056.40] And you just went, no, I don't think I will.
[3057.04 → 3058.10] So here's the thing.
[3058.18 → 3059.20] Here's the big problem.
[3059.20 → 3065.72] Their argument for why that first ad, when you click into the shorts' shelf, it used to be called.
[3065.76 → 3066.60] I don't know what they call it now.
[3067.04 → 3067.98] Shorts something.
[3069.60 → 3070.20] I don't know.
[3070.44 → 3070.68] Feed.
[3070.92 → 3071.06] Yeah.
[3071.88 → 3075.98] Their argument for why that first ad, when you navigate into the shorts feed,
[3076.16 → 3082.20] should not go into the pool, is that they haven't interacted with a short yet.
[3082.20 → 3088.26] So there would be no way of knowing what short that ad view should be attributed to.
[3090.78 → 3091.38] YouTube?
[3092.50 → 3094.80] That's the whole point of pooling it.
[3095.34 → 3095.82] Remember?
[3096.56 → 3102.54] Remember that whole deck that you went through with me for like 45 minutes,
[3103.04 → 3107.60] explaining this whole system where you were going to compensate the music rights holders,
[3107.60 → 3110.56] and then create these pools, and then it would be a shared pool,
[3110.66 → 3114.56] because the truth is we have no, unlike a normal video,
[3114.74 → 3117.24] where you actually interact with the video,
[3117.46 → 3119.46] and then there's a pre-roll, and then there's a mid-roll,
[3119.54 → 3120.78] and then there's a post-roll, and whatever,
[3120.88 → 3121.90] where you can clearly say,
[3122.00 → 3125.04] okay, this viewer was retained by this video,
[3125.16 → 3127.42] and these ads are associated with this video.
[3127.42 → 3131.62] The whole point of pooling it is that you can't do that.
[3132.52 → 3133.70] So riddle me this.
[3134.66 → 3137.66] Why would anybody click on the shorts feed
[3137.66 → 3142.38] if they weren't driven there by shorts creators?
[3143.46 → 3148.58] What makes you think that it was you and you alone
[3148.58 → 3154.20] who was responsible for that interaction, for that ad view?
[3154.20 → 3158.62] There is actually zero rational defence.
[3158.68 → 3160.80] There is no logical defence for this,
[3160.92 → 3164.76] because they already laid out the reason for everything being pooled.
[3165.78 → 3168.44] And, you know, okay, so why am I flipping out over this?
[3168.58 → 3170.36] They took my money.
[3171.10 → 3175.80] In reality, YouTube AdSense is already a fraction of our revenue,
[3176.12 → 3182.54] and of that, shorts is a tiny, just infinitely small fraction.
[3182.54 → 3183.50] Not for everyone, though.
[3183.50 → 3185.08] This doesn't hurt me.
[3185.78 → 3187.40] We've got LTT Store.
[3187.76 → 3189.28] We've got LTX.
[3189.54 → 3192.40] We've got our direct sponsor relationships.
[3192.64 → 3193.50] Like, we're fine.
[3193.66 → 3194.34] Not even mentioned.
[3194.62 → 3195.80] We're 100% fine.
[3196.02 → 3196.82] Right there, though.
[3197.06 → 3197.52] Let's go.
[3197.90 → 3198.56] Flow plane!
[3200.10 → 3201.00] We're fine.
[3202.00 → 3203.58] But this is not fine.
[3204.32 → 3209.10] And it represents just, like, what is going on over there?
[3209.10 → 3213.14] Like, Google was supposed to be the less evil tech giant, right?
[3213.46 → 3215.76] And certainly they haven't been always.
[3215.92 → 3218.14] But did you see how they handled the last round of layoffs?
[3218.32 → 3224.18] Not one, but multiple ex-Google employees reported getting an email,
[3224.32 → 3228.70] laying them off, while they're sitting in the hospital with their newborn child.
[3228.78 → 3229.62] And I'm sitting here going,
[3229.62 → 3232.32] even if that's legal.
[3233.94 → 3236.50] I don't know how true or real this is,
[3236.56 → 3241.10] but I read a short little story thing about someone who was travelling,
[3241.68 → 3244.36] but they were in the States on a work visa,
[3244.36 → 3248.10] and they got fired while they were travelling over email.
[3248.66 → 3250.30] So they can't come back.
[3252.44 → 3256.58] So, like, their stuff, their car, everything is just, like,
[3256.86 → 3259.38] they're getting one of their friends to, like, sell it for them.
[3260.20 → 3262.40] And they just have to, like, yeah, I don't know.
[3263.72 → 3264.40] Really brutal.
[3265.18 → 3265.36] Yeah.
[3265.58 → 3271.20] So, in a nutshell, this is a super slippery slope.
[3271.20 → 3272.80] And you know what?
[3273.12 → 3275.84] Honestly, I'm not expecting anything good to come of this.
[3276.24 → 3278.00] If anything, if I was Google,
[3278.68 → 3282.20] I would just kind of listen to my feedback and go,
[3282.30 → 3283.92] well, we just won't clarify that next time.
[3284.56 → 3290.78] We will just write the policy in such a way that it never raises this question.
[3291.50 → 3298.58] So we'll say all ads displayed between short videos are eligible for the pool.
[3298.58 → 3304.18] And then just quietly just, well, we'll just put some ads at the beginning.
[3305.46 → 3308.48] But they weren't between anything.
[3309.82 → 3312.28] Then we just need Spiffing Britt to figure it out for us.
[3313.10 → 3315.64] I don't even, this is probably because I don't watch enough shorts,
[3315.76 → 3316.66] but I don't even get it.
[3316.90 → 3322.10] Like, if I click on a short, like, if I'm on the YouTube app thing,
[3322.14 → 3324.48] and I click on a short, it doesn't immediately play an ad, right?
[3324.52 → 3326.56] It plays the short that I click on.
[3326.56 → 3331.88] No, but if you, from the YouTube app, if you just click shorts,
[3332.90 → 3338.12] if it plays an ad before it plays a short, they go, well, that's ours.
[3338.68 → 3341.72] That had nothing to do with shorts creators.
[3342.14 → 3343.32] That's obviously wrong.
[3343.36 → 3344.42] That was all us.
[3347.52 → 3349.04] Absolute bulls**t.
[3350.14 → 3350.70] 100%.
[3350.70 → 3357.56] I was trying to pick a lift me up topic.
[3357.62 → 3358.54] Man, it didn't work.
[3358.64 → 3360.24] And the discussion question here is like,
[3360.34 → 3362.68] why act in bad faith over such a petty amount of money?
[3362.82 → 3365.12] That actually is a perfect question.
[3365.50 → 3367.86] Because compared to traditional ads,
[3367.86 → 3372.62] I do not expect the shorts fund in general,
[3372.72 → 3373.76] the shorts pool in general,
[3373.92 → 3377.76] and I especially do not expect this small percentage of ads
[3377.76 → 3381.30] that they're displaying before they actually play a short
[3381.30 → 3383.36] to even make an impact.
[3383.58 → 3385.42] So why carve it out?
[3387.10 → 3388.30] It's ludicrous.
[3388.30 → 3390.10] Yeah.
[3392.40 → 3395.66] I have no idea.
[3396.00 → 3398.58] I want to kind of assume that it has something to do with like
[3398.58 → 3402.54] shareholder happiness because stocks in general for a while
[3402.54 → 3404.92] have been a little, as far as I know,
[3404.96 → 3406.40] they're going slightly up recently.
[3406.60 → 3406.98] I don't know.
[3407.10 → 3408.26] I mean, that's the thing though.
[3408.28 → 3408.72] It's been a little brutal.
[3408.90 → 3409.64] Like that's the thing.
[3409.70 → 3411.70] That's what I'm talking about with Google right now though.
[3411.76 → 3411.96] It's like,
[3411.96 → 3415.08] there's still a company that's making literally billions of dollars a quarter
[3415.08 → 3417.00] and they're sitting there going,
[3417.14 → 3418.32] okay, we need to,
[3418.32 → 3419.80] we need to cut this cost.
[3419.94 → 3420.28] We need to,
[3420.34 → 3422.22] we need to squeeze blood from this stone here.
[3422.32 → 3422.88] We need to,
[3423.04 → 3423.20] you know,
[3423.24 → 3423.56] whatever.
[3423.84 → 3425.18] And I'm looking at it going like,
[3425.46 → 3425.64] no,
[3425.74 → 3430.54] the reason you guys just brought the founders back in is because of the
[3430.62 → 3433.18] of the absolutely existential,
[3433.72 → 3440.12] like threat that is ChatGPT and AI chat assistance.
[3441.08 → 3443.96] This doesn't even register.
[3445.08 → 3446.04] Yeah.
[3446.26 → 3446.66] Why,
[3446.78 → 3449.04] why are you fighting such a ridiculous battle?
[3449.14 → 3449.72] And I honestly,
[3449.82 → 3450.46] I don't even think,
[3450.52 → 3451.68] I don't even think a shareholder,
[3451.84 → 3454.40] this wouldn't merit mention on a shareholder call anyway.
[3456.42 → 3456.86] Yeah.
[3456.96 → 3457.48] I don't know.
[3457.94 → 3458.68] I don't know.
[3459.66 → 3460.12] I don't know.
[3460.90 → 3461.20] And I,
[3461.38 → 3462.02] so yeah,
[3462.12 → 3463.94] so Tom XYZ goes,
[3464.02 → 3465.96] Google missed earnings per share by 12% this quarter.
[3466.12 → 3466.52] Right.
[3467.02 → 3468.40] That's not going to make up 12%.
[3468.40 → 3469.16] Yeah.
[3469.32 → 3469.86] It won't.
[3469.86 → 3474.12] It will do absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things for Google.
[3474.12 → 3476.26] And in spite of that,
[3476.26 → 3477.34] that big miss,
[3477.46 → 3477.70] big,
[3477.80 → 3478.54] big problem,
[3479.08 → 3483.28] Google made billions and billions of dollars this quarter.
[3483.66 → 3484.20] So,
[3484.34 → 3484.62] okay.
[3485.24 → 3485.58] Yeah.
[3485.72 → 3486.42] I don't know.
[3486.48 → 3487.02] Maybe I'm just,
[3487.26 → 3487.80] maybe I'm,
[3487.90 → 3488.04] maybe,
[3488.04 → 3489.84] maybe I'm just not getting it.
[3490.08 → 3490.38] Yeah.
[3490.38 → 3491.76] Maybe I'm not getting it.
[3492.16 → 3492.48] Yep.
[3494.58 → 3495.16] You know,
[3495.18 → 3497.72] it'll make me feel better telling you about our sponsors.
[3498.42 → 3498.86] Nice.
[3499.16 → 3499.54] Nice.
[3500.74 → 3501.82] Where the heck are they?
[3502.14 → 3502.42] Ah,
[3502.56 → 3502.80] yes.
[3503.18 → 3509.52] The show is brought to you by Bessie wet socks,
[3510.02 → 3511.94] wet socks,
[3512.06 → 3512.24] Luke.
[3512.40 → 3512.94] They suck.
[3513.12 → 3513.28] Yeah.
[3513.30 → 3513.46] They,
[3513.54 → 3514.10] they suck.
[3514.10 → 3515.30] Why would you want wet socks?
[3515.30 → 3515.90] But don't worry.
[3516.24 → 3517.20] Bessie's on the case.
[3517.94 → 3521.58] Bessie says their shoes are made of 100% waterproof materials.
[3521.58 → 3523.94] Thanks to their Demoted technology.
[3524.16 → 3524.30] Now,
[3524.46 → 3526.62] obviously in the very long term,
[3526.80 → 3527.18] you could,
[3527.26 → 3528.92] you could put a hole in them or whatever,
[3529.00 → 3530.14] and they wouldn't be waterproof anymore,
[3530.14 → 3533.64] but we're pretty impressed by how darn water-resistant they are.
[3533.76 → 3534.68] And it's that same,
[3534.80 → 3538.54] it's the same technology that keeps your feet cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
[3538.54 → 3544.46] Their new storm burst shoes combine the comfort of a sneaker with the grip and coverage of an outdoor boot.
[3544.96 → 3550.30] And Bessie has added extra layering for warmth and extra grip to keep you grounded in all weather conditions.
[3550.70 → 3551.52] I just want to clarify,
[3551.76 → 3552.74] when we say grounded,
[3552.96 → 3553.96] we're not talking like,
[3554.10 → 3558.62] like anything to do with ESD safety or lightning strikes or anything like that.
[3558.68 → 3561.68] It's like to keep your feet on the ground instead of your butt.
[3562.26 → 3565.56] The storm bursts are easy to take off and put on thanks to their handy pull tabs.
[3565.56 → 3569.22] So say no to soggy socks and say yes to springtime adventures.
[3569.40 → 3576.72] Check out the Bessie storm burst and other styles at Bessie.com slash WAN show and use code LTT for 15% off your entire order.
[3577.02 → 3579.00] Ran into one of my badminton friends who's wearing Bessie's.
[3579.10 → 3579.28] I'm like,
[3579.34 → 3579.42] hey,
[3579.48 → 3579.98] nice Bessie's.
[3580.08 → 3581.80] Use code LTT to save 15%.
[3581.80 → 3582.04] He goes,
[3582.14 → 3582.28] nah,
[3582.34 → 3582.52] dog.
[3582.56 → 3582.80] I'm like,
[3584.10 → 3586.78] I try to help you.
[3587.10 → 3588.02] I try to help people.
[3588.42 → 3588.66] Okay.
[3589.10 → 3592.00] The show is also brought to you today by FreshBooks.
[3592.82 → 3594.22] I'm guessing you're not an accountant.
[3594.50 → 3595.30] Statistically speaking,
[3595.56 → 3596.44] you probably aren't.
[3596.84 → 3599.60] Working on your books can bring up difficult questions like,
[3600.00 → 3601.42] what numbers go in what column?
[3601.88 → 3603.36] And what report should I run?
[3603.54 → 3604.40] It's a difficult question.
[3604.48 → 3605.48] What number goes in what column,
[3605.58 → 3605.68] Luke?
[3605.72 → 3606.04] Help me.
[3606.34 → 3606.74] It's hard.
[3607.12 → 3607.28] Yeah.
[3607.34 → 3608.72] A goes in the first one,
[3608.76 → 3608.94] right?
[3609.36 → 3610.12] That's not a number.
[3610.92 → 3611.18] No,
[3611.24 → 3611.52] but it's,
[3611.52 → 3613.30] but it is the first column in a spreadsheet.
[3613.42 → 3613.78] But you said,
[3613.88 → 3614.28] what number goes in what column?
[3614.28 → 3614.76] You smart ass.
[3615.46 → 3615.96] You said,
[3616.02 → 3617.12] what number goes in what column?
[3617.20 → 3617.30] Yeah,
[3617.36 → 3617.96] I'm just messing with you.
[3618.50 → 3623.78] FreshBooks is an easy-to-use accounting software that makes it simple to send invoices and collect your cash.

[3701.84 → 3704.10] Are you going to manage to pick a positive topic for a change?
[3704.40 → 3704.60] No.
[3704.70 → 3705.64] Can I trust you to do this?
[3705.74 → 3711.92] But someone in Flip plane chat named This Past Winter said something that I think is actually kind of brilliant.
[3712.52 → 3717.34] I'm going to start making shorts that are reactions to ads that YouTube plays before shorts.
[3718.42 → 3720.40] Oh, where's your defence now, YouTube?
[3720.76 → 3721.44] What's up?
[3721.44 → 3721.80] What's up?
[3721.80 → 3723.06] What's up now, YouTube?
[3723.80 → 3724.38] Got him.
[3724.44 → 3728.04] I wanted to talk about, and maybe we will anyway, but maybe not right now.
[3728.12 → 3732.18] I wanted to talk about Blizzard penalizing players who regularly play with cheaters.
[3732.60 → 3734.12] Yeah, I want to talk about that.
[3734.18 → 3735.48] The topic is not filled out.
[3735.56 → 3737.52] I can just read from the source.
[3737.70 → 3740.40] Well, I don't think the topic's going to get any more filled out than it is now.
[3740.86 → 3741.18] True.
[3741.48 → 3741.78] Okay.
[3742.12 → 3742.72] Going for it.
[3742.78 → 3743.54] True, true.
[3743.54 → 3748.84] The Overwatch 2 team is frustrated with the amount of cheaters.
[3749.16 → 3752.92] Apparently, they've banned, where is it, 50,000 accounts, I think?
[3753.18 → 3753.48] Wow.
[3753.64 → 3757.44] Over 50,000 accounts have been actioned, whatever that means.
[3757.44 → 3762.10] I think that might be a range from temp bans to permanent bans, whatever.
[3762.86 → 3770.98] Since launch, Blizzard has apparently had enough to the extent it's no longer just targeting the cheaters, but those who go along with them.
[3770.98 → 3771.98] Awesome.
[3773.24 → 3778.34] So if you see someone cheating on your team, you need to, like, book it out of the...
[3778.34 → 3780.92] It's saying who regularly play with cheaters.
[3781.06 → 3784.06] I suspect it's going to have something to do with the partying system.
[3784.30 → 3784.70] Ah.
[3785.36 → 3793.58] So if you kind of go, well, I'm not cheating, but I'm hiding behind a tank who has infinite health or whatever.
[3793.58 → 3800.92] This is a big deal for games that have any form of ranking system or have any form of external...
[3800.92 → 3812.32] Say you were playing some form of game where you could gain a lot of some type of resource, whether it's, like, loot or money or whatever, from demolishing a bunch of enemies.
[3812.58 → 3816.54] Well, if you play with a cheater who does that, then you can gain all that resource.
[3816.54 → 3825.84] If you're playing a game where you're trying to rank, where you're trying to play competitively, you can boost your account by playing with someone who's cheating to get your account boosted.
[3825.90 → 3829.86] There are a lot of different benefits that you can get from getting carried by someone who's cheating.
[3829.86 → 3830.00] Right.
[3830.10 → 3836.16] So if you just have some, like, random account, and you're just like, yo, buddy, play this one and party up with me.
[3836.22 → 3836.60] Let's go.
[3837.02 → 3837.16] Yeah.
[3837.76 → 3839.70] So hammering down on people like that.
[3839.84 → 3844.86] Also making it so that kind of forcing the community to do this, which is good.
[3845.04 → 3845.98] Start to self-police.
[3845.98 → 3846.38] Yeah.
[3847.18 → 3849.48] If you figure out that your buddy's cheating...
[3849.48 → 3850.32] Like, hey, stop it.
[3850.32 → 3850.98] Get him to stop.
[3851.32 → 3852.62] Because you don't want to get banned.
[3852.68 → 3855.26] What's the difference between this and, like, the social credit system exactly?
[3855.90 → 3856.62] Oh, come on.
[3857.74 → 3858.46] Okay, okay.
[3858.52 → 3859.48] I was being a jerk.
[3860.02 → 3863.26] Yeah, but you shouldn't want to play with people who cheat.
[3863.48 → 3867.74] I have read online sentiment of people who are like, well, I'm not cheating.
[3868.06 → 3872.28] I don't, like, loot their kills, or I don't, uh, whatever.
[3872.54 → 3875.18] I don't interact in whatever way, so I don't really care.
[3875.18 → 3877.02] And it's like, no, that's BS.
[3878.02 → 3879.18] You should stop playing with them.
[3879.92 → 3880.06] Yeah.
[3880.06 → 3883.06] And you should, like, pressure your friends to not cheat in games because it's stupid.
[3883.24 → 3885.08] Unless, obviously, it's single-player games.
[3885.18 → 3885.56] That could be fun.
[3885.56 → 3887.32] I have to tell you, I don't play with cheaters.
[3887.32 → 3891.28] I had a mixed doubles partner that I was playing with for a while in badminton.
[3891.84 → 3898.12] And at a tournament, on a match point, I watched them make an obvious bad call.
[3898.12 → 3905.16] Um, and I was just like, yeah, I mean, I hope it was worth it to you, but I'm never playing
[3905.16 → 3905.62] with you again.
[3905.74 → 3910.38] I just don't do that because if you don't respect the spirit of competition, why are we all doing
[3910.38 → 3910.72] this?
[3910.88 → 3911.48] What's the point?
[3911.48 → 3913.36] It was like in, and they said it was out or something?
[3913.44 → 3913.66] Clearly in.
[3913.92 → 3914.62] And they called it out.
[3914.80 → 3914.94] Yeah.
[3915.24 → 3915.44] Yeah.
[3915.44 → 3919.76] And the way it works in a rec tournament where it's not, you don't have, like, you know,
[3919.82 → 3925.74] paid officials or anything like that is the call is up to the person whose side it lands
[3925.74 → 3926.04] on.
[3926.16 → 3927.32] And it's an honour system.
[3927.32 → 3932.38] But from my point of view, they basically just demonstrated they have absolutely no honour
[3932.38 → 3932.92] whatsoever.
[3933.30 → 3933.40] Yeah.
[3933.64 → 3935.10] And you don't want to be associated with that.
[3935.26 → 3936.72] I don't want to be associated with that.
[3937.00 → 3942.60] Like I'm, the thing is like, so my, my reputation means a lot to me when I call something out,
[3942.60 → 3945.28] I want people to go, well, it must've been out then.
[3945.86 → 3946.26] Yeah.
[3946.44 → 3948.34] So I will go, I will go out of my way.
[3948.38 → 3956.02] If I'm not sure if I am under 80%, 85% sure, I just go, just take it always.
[3956.02 → 3961.30] And I, I don't think this is going to work though.
[3961.76 → 3966.08] I don't think that, I don't think they're going to be able to police this in.
[3966.56 → 3968.88] I think it will, I think it will work consistently.
[3969.10 → 3970.36] I think it will work somewhat.
[3970.70 → 3971.16] You think so?
[3971.24 → 3976.74] There are absolutely people in a wide variety of games, probably more games than you'd even
[3976.74 → 3979.36] expect that will pay for carries consistently.
[3980.88 → 3984.52] And I think that is going to be trackable.
[3984.52 → 3986.50] Do I think it's going to be a huge number of people?
[3987.14 → 3987.92] Probably not.
[3989.20 → 3993.26] No Bad Chair in Float plane says, in Escape from Markov, a game I have played, but suck at,
[3993.34 → 3999.30] so I understand what you're talking about at least, but it's common practice to pay a
[3999.30 → 4001.84] cheater to clean your server and loot everything.
[4002.04 → 4002.14] Yep.
[4002.14 → 4006.54] So like, so they'll just, they'll just whiz around and kill the entire lobby.
[4006.76 → 4008.60] And then, so all the players will die.
[4008.68 → 4011.50] And then any AI that spawns in, they'll just kill them.
[4011.60 → 4013.40] And they'll just tell you where all the loot is.
[4013.72 → 4017.52] And they can, they can like to scan the entire map, see where all the high value loot is.
[4017.62 → 4019.94] They can see all the loot that's on different players that they killed.
[4019.94 → 4021.20] So they just tell you where to go.
[4021.30 → 4022.18] You pick everything up.
[4022.38 → 4024.66] And then you're just chatted out and...
[4024.66 → 4028.32] And you exit with all your money, all your quest completion, all your progress, everything
[4028.32 → 4028.78] you needed.
[4029.78 → 4035.80] They can even like, they can, they can set their, they can set their targeting system so
[4035.80 → 4037.54] that the cheater shoots people's legs.
[4038.40 → 4040.76] So they become like borderline immobilized.
[4040.84 → 4042.28] You can kind of hobble around, but that's it.
[4042.38 → 4044.70] And then the player can go around and pick them off.
[4044.80 → 4044.98] And get kills.
[4045.24 → 4045.46] Yeah.
[4045.90 → 4047.08] Like it's super brutal.
[4048.16 → 4048.84] There's, there's...
[4048.84 → 4050.08] Have you had that happen to you before?
[4050.52 → 4051.70] That exact scenario?
[4051.82 → 4052.90] I honestly don't think so.
[4053.26 → 4053.48] Right.
[4053.54 → 4056.50] But I have died from cheaters many times in Escape from Markov.
[4056.60 → 4058.54] It's, it's a reality of playing the game, to be honest.
[4058.78 → 4059.12] Right.
[4059.60 → 4061.52] It's, it's not like, it's not constant.
[4063.18 → 4066.26] Like, I don't think we've ever had that happen when we were playing.
[4066.26 → 4067.14] Not that we could tell.
[4067.28 → 4068.00] Not that we could tell.
[4068.08 → 4074.14] That's a big problem with it, is when, when it happens enough, it adds a reasonable level
[4074.14 → 4076.58] of doubt of the legitimacy of the other player.
[4076.78 → 4077.00] Yep.
[4077.38 → 4080.34] So if something happens, that's like resync, right?
[4080.72 → 4081.54] Server resync.
[4081.64 → 4085.16] So they, they kind of chopped on your screen oddly or something like that.
[4085.18 → 4086.74] And it's just, it's just server problems.
[4086.74 → 4088.82] But to you, it might look like their speed hacking.
[4089.18 → 4089.86] Yeah, for sure.
[4089.98 → 4090.84] And you die to it.
[4090.88 → 4092.16] So you're like, oh, that's a cheater.
[4092.54 → 4094.30] But no, it's just some server problem.
[4094.30 → 4096.00] Or, or maybe something weird happened.
[4096.06 → 4096.76] You didn't realize it.
[4096.90 → 4099.88] Maybe the person that actually killed you was like way off on the side.
[4099.96 → 4102.56] But you don't know that because they have no replay system.
[4102.56 → 4106.38] They have no, uh, overwatch or is it called overwatch?
[4106.48 → 4112.40] Whatever the system that counterstrike has, um, where this is an amazing system and way
[4112.40 → 4113.82] more games need this type of system.
[4113.86 → 4114.46] It's fantastic.
[4114.92 → 4119.56] Um, but counterstrike has this, this thing where you can watch gameplay.
[4119.82 → 4124.30] Cause you know how with, uh, counterstrike, you can like replay games because it logs all
[4124.30 → 4128.22] the information, not as a video, but as a file, and you can replay it back.
[4128.22 → 4134.26] So you can watch gameplay from those players, um, see if they were snapping to you or whatever
[4134.26 → 4134.62] else.
[4134.74 → 4134.98] Yeah.
[4135.06 → 4138.76] And some like streamers and stuff will just do it as like a fun content tool.
[4138.76 → 4138.88] Sure.
[4139.36 → 4140.98] Reacting to cheaters killing me or whatever.
[4141.24 → 4141.48] Yeah.
[4141.56 → 4144.00] And it will, and because you can, yeah, you can replay your match.
[4144.00 → 4148.72] And then if more games had that, you would get more legitimate reports.
[4149.02 → 4154.10] Because I guarantee you there are times in Escape from Markov, for example, I have reported
[4154.10 → 4156.40] players that were legit.
[4157.12 → 4161.42] I don't know that, but just out of the amount of times I've reported people, I am certain
[4161.42 → 4162.10] it has happened.
[4162.22 → 4162.60] Right.
[4162.70 → 4164.08] Maybe it was a resync issue.
[4164.32 → 4165.50] Maybe it was someone different.
[4165.58 → 4165.78] Yeah.
[4165.82 → 4166.34] I don't know.
[4166.60 → 4168.58] And I hope if they were legit, they didn't get banned.
[4168.62 → 4169.20] I'm sure they didn't.
[4169.20 → 4171.40] Cause the amount of people that aren't legit, that aren't banned.
[4171.74 → 4176.66] Uh, um, but I'm also sure that I have reported that people that, that are cheating.
[4176.66 → 4177.26] So I don't know.
[4177.28 → 4180.54] It would be better if I could watch the map back.
[4180.54 → 4185.38] Maybe, maybe once the entire thing was fully completed and the map was fully closed, you
[4185.38 → 4186.70] could finally watch it back.
[4187.20 → 4188.82] Um, but being able to see, yeah.
[4188.82 → 4191.02] Hey Dan, if you're going somewhere, man has water, please.
[4191.34 → 4195.96] Being able to see how things happen, uh, and being able to get more legitimate reporting.
[4200.40 → 4202.78] Being able to get more legitimate reporting would be good.
[4203.24 → 4208.20] Um, and, and I think there should be ways, and I can think of a lot of games where there
[4208.20 → 4209.10] would be a way for this.
[4209.10 → 4211.18] I believe Overwatch has loot boxes.
[4211.18 → 4212.26] I haven't played it in a long time.
[4212.58 → 4213.70] It did last time I played it.
[4214.00 → 4219.74] Uh, make it so that like, oh, if you get a bunch of success, like if you do that system
[4219.74 → 4225.90] where you review gameplay, and you vote the, the way that it ends up being like decided,
[4226.10 → 4230.98] you like, once you do like 10 of them or something correctly, you get a loot box or something.
[4231.10 → 4231.26] Yeah.
[4231.28 → 4234.66] Like try to incentivize people to engage in the system.
[4234.78 → 4236.86] In this kind of community policing, I guess.
[4236.86 → 4242.08] Because no one's going to like, as much as we all want to say it, none of these developers
[4242.08 → 4243.14] are going to solve this problem.
[4243.46 → 4244.98] You cannot solve cheating in video games.
[4244.98 → 4245.14] Yeah.
[4245.18 → 4248.94] We were actually, we were having a conversation about this, not on WAN show a little while
[4248.94 → 4249.22] ago.
[4249.22 → 4257.62] And just talking about how sophisticated cheating methods are already today and how we are already
[4257.62 → 4260.82] at a point where you actually cannot stop it.
[4260.82 → 4267.18] I mean, there, there, there already exists systems where you can just have a mechanical
[4267.18 → 4272.66] arm moving an actual peripheral, just connected to a normal system.
[4272.66 → 4276.12] The system has no cheating software running on it whatsoever.
[4276.12 → 4278.06] You can just use screen capture.
[4278.66 → 4280.84] And then even do external screen capture.
[4280.92 → 4285.74] Like there, there are ways to do it that it is 100% legitimately impossible to detect.
[4285.74 → 4291.84] So like, okay, sure, there are also cheats that are possible to detect.
[4291.92 → 4296.04] And I'm sure there are lots of games, game developers that could do a better job.
[4296.30 → 4299.24] But continuing that argument is not super useful.
[4299.44 → 4304.50] I think the more useful argument is adding more tools for the community to be able to
[4304.50 → 4306.74] self-police as much as it can.
[4306.84 → 4311.40] I actually like this initiative because it incentivizes people to not play with friends
[4311.40 → 4313.06] of theirs that they might know are cheating.
[4313.48 → 4313.58] Yeah.
[4313.90 → 4315.32] Turn them into a pariah.
[4315.32 → 4321.10] It will also get them to be like, kind of question people that are acting super suspicious.
[4321.42 → 4323.36] Be like, bro, like, are you cheating?
[4323.46 → 4325.42] Because I don't want to get banned with you if you are.
[4325.62 → 4325.74] Yeah.
[4325.80 → 4327.46] So basically it's the social credit system.
[4327.66 → 4329.08] I can't believe you're defending this.
[4329.22 → 4330.26] I like it in this case.
[4331.62 → 4332.88] And, and, and adding.
[4332.96 → 4334.30] So that's the line for you.
[4334.70 → 4335.48] Video game cheating.
[4335.48 → 4336.10] Yeah, video game cheating.
[4336.10 → 4337.92] That's where you'll accept a surveillance state.
[4338.18 → 4338.54] Yep.
[4339.14 → 4340.58] You heard it here first, folks.
[4340.58 → 4346.86] And adding systems like that, like that Counter-Strike system where you can review gameplay.
[4346.86 → 4353.54] Even just, even if it's not the Overwatch or whatever it was called type of system that
[4353.54 → 4354.18] Counter-Strike had.
[4354.40 → 4361.46] Even it was just being able to view a gameplay, sorry, view a replay of the game that you can
[4361.46 → 4362.48] see from any perspective.
[4362.48 → 4366.38] And then being able to report on your own from that view.
[4366.38 → 4366.86] Yeah.
[4367.02 → 4369.42] That'd be a total, total game changer.
[4369.56 → 4373.90] Because there are a bunch of times in, in Markov specifically where I'm like, that was really
[4373.90 → 4375.72] suspicious, but I have no idea.
[4375.86 → 4379.08] And if I could just watch it back, I would make my decision then.
[4379.34 → 4379.60] Yep.
[4379.96 → 4382.48] But right now I'm just going to report it because.
[4382.74 → 4383.08] Yeah, you're blind.
[4383.08 → 4383.52] You're blind.
[4383.66 → 4383.84] Yeah.
[4383.94 → 4384.62] Well, I don't know.
[4384.62 → 4384.88] You're in the dark.
[4385.16 → 4385.40] Yeah.
[4386.78 → 4389.26] On that note, Mr. Beast for president.
[4389.26 → 4397.96] This week, Mr. Beast released a video where he paid for a thousand blind people to receive
[4397.96 → 4399.02] cataract surgery.
[4399.66 → 4402.68] And a lot of people are big mad.
[4404.70 → 4405.34] Okay.
[4405.56 → 4406.72] So let's unpack that.
[4407.06 → 4411.60] This kind of philanthropic slash giveaway content is fairly typical for Mr. Beast.
[4412.06 → 4415.40] And the surgeries were done in partnership with Sea International.
[4415.40 → 4421.54] Mr. Beast's rationale for it can be found in a tweet that was posted the same day.
[4424.44 → 4425.32] Actually, you know what?
[4425.34 → 4426.70] Let's do the criticisms first.
[4427.14 → 4430.26] So one, this is the monetization of people's suffering.
[4430.42 → 4432.38] The charity contributes resources to helping people.
[4432.38 → 4436.84] Meaning not all the money that made this happen is from Mr. Beast.
[4437.14 → 4440.52] And the additional attention will lead to future profits from him.
[4441.16 → 4441.26] Okay.
[4441.26 → 4441.36] Okay.
[4441.84 → 4447.56] Number two is that people who can't afford surgery shouldn't have to wait for random
[4447.56 → 4450.76] acts of kindness from a wealthy celebrity to fix basic problems.
[4450.96 → 4456.92] And this applause and focus on individual charity distracts from the structural changes that need
[4456.92 → 4457.36] to happen.
[4458.12 → 4461.94] And number three criticism was it's kind of cringe, yo.
[4462.44 → 4467.52] Some viewers reported feeling deeply uncomfortable with the general dynamic of a rich dude making
[4467.52 → 4470.98] a video of person after person being desperately grateful to him.
[4472.60 → 4474.48] Now, let's go back to...
[4474.48 → 4477.68] So in this case, this is someone that I actually do know personally.
[4477.82 → 4484.34] It's not like we've spent, you know, many, many, many, you know, months together working side by side
[4484.34 → 4488.78] or, you know, in the fields, you know, harvesting wheat or whatever he's making videos about these days.
[4489.04 → 4489.44] I don't know.
[4489.52 → 4491.08] I could see him doing like...
[4491.08 → 4495.60] I spent 30 days, you know, harvesting wheat in a field.
[4495.68 → 4496.18] Like, who knows?
[4497.06 → 4498.30] He could make it entertaining.
[4498.48 → 4499.18] Do you deny it?
[4499.30 → 4500.02] I probably could.
[4500.04 → 4500.32] Okay.
[4500.46 → 4501.82] So the point is...
[4501.82 → 4504.52] But this is an individual that I actually know.
[4505.02 → 4506.98] And so first are the defences.
[4507.14 → 4511.00] So I already said this, but this kind of philanthropic slash giveaway content is pretty on brand for him,
[4511.06 → 4511.56] pretty typical.
[4512.02 → 4515.46] And his rationale can be found in a tweet posted the same day.
[4515.48 → 4516.26] And this is what he said.
[4517.12 → 4520.18] I don't understand why curable blindness is a thing.
[4520.18 → 4522.36] Why don't governments step in and help?
[4522.76 → 4525.70] Even if you're thinking purely from a financial standpoint,
[4525.84 → 4531.06] it's hard to see how they don't ROI on taxes from people being able to work again.
[4536.76 → 4539.18] That is one of the most...
[4542.24 → 4544.20] How do I put this?
[4544.20 → 4550.32] I like Jimmy a lot.
[4551.06 → 4551.66] He's...
[4551.66 → 4557.50] I think he's pretty transparent that his, you know, his main goal is to be the biggest YouTuber ever.
[4557.90 → 4559.86] I don't think he shies away from that.
[4559.86 → 4561.38] And I don't think he...
[4561.38 → 4568.94] I don't think he hides from the fact that, you know, a lot of what he does is in service of that goal.
[4569.48 → 4569.74] Right?
[4571.00 → 4572.32] No, he doesn't even hide.
[4572.52 → 4573.82] He promotes that.
[4573.90 → 4574.60] He has no issue.
[4574.60 → 4589.96] However, something that you guys have got to understand about him is that, A, he's super, super young and has basically lived in a bubble creating YouTube content for, like, his entire adult life.
[4589.96 → 4600.56] And two, is that I think the YouTube content aside and wanting to be the biggest YouTuber and whatever else aside, I think he genuinely has a good heart.
[4601.68 → 4613.62] And what's fascinating to me is this tweet is either engineered to be as viral as possible, which is an option.
[4613.62 → 4615.88] You know, he certainly could do it.
[4616.04 → 4620.52] If there's anyone who I could look at and say, you know, yeah, that probably...
[4620.52 → 4624.60] Those words in that order is probably whatever would perform the absolute best.
[4625.08 → 4626.28] He could do that.
[4626.42 → 4627.06] I wouldn't...
[4627.06 → 4628.52] Yeah, I believe it.
[4630.40 → 4633.02] But I want to believe its something else.
[4633.02 → 4656.34] I want to believe it's an awakening where he is figuring out that for him to actually make a difference in the world, he needs to promote societal change, structural change, rather than just making charity porn, which is what some people described the curing blindness video as.
[4656.34 → 4663.66] However, I think that he's going to encounter...
[4663.66 → 4683.70] Well, he's already encountering, but I think that if he actually goes down this path of, hey, this is just kind of common sense from a common good standpoint, we should all work together to cure this very curable illness so that this person can even just purely from a financial standpoint,
[4683.70 → 4687.40] contribute more to our nation's GDP, right?
[4687.70 → 4688.96] Like, we should just all do this.
[4689.26 → 4696.70] I think that particularly in the nation where he lives, he's going to run into a lot of...
[4697.38 → 4698.02] Pushback.
[4698.44 → 4698.74] Yeah.
[4699.06 → 4700.16] A lot of resistance.
[4700.70 → 4711.20] And it's baffling to me because I already live in a country where this surgery is just fine that you just get it.
[4711.20 → 4714.50] And do you get it tomorrow?
[4714.82 → 4715.84] Not necessarily.
[4716.52 → 4716.66] Okay.
[4716.68 → 4717.66] It's a triage system.
[4717.76 → 4721.30] If something more urgent comes along, you will probably get bumped.
[4721.50 → 4722.74] And we often have shortages.
[4722.96 → 4725.22] And we often have shortages.
[4726.22 → 4726.82] But that's a...
[4726.82 → 4728.52] I mean, that's a long conversation.
[4728.78 → 4736.14] Part of our shortages are because we have a significant brain drain down to the for-profit medical system down in the States,
[4736.14 → 4742.34] where doctors can make way more money at predatory hospitals than they could up here.
[4742.52 → 4746.76] So that's a whole can of worms we're not going to bother trying to unpack today.
[4747.22 → 4748.76] Our system's not perfect.
[4748.76 → 4757.12] But, like, much like I think Jimmy is trying to get across here, shouldn't we all be trying?
[4757.12 → 4760.68] The timing is fascinating.
[4760.80 → 4767.22] I don't know if you saw this, but the U.S. House of Representatives passed a motion, which is kind of meaningless.
[4767.42 → 4768.12] It's just posturing.
[4768.28 → 4770.16] But passed a motion denouncing socialism.
[4770.16 → 4775.58] I'm not convinced that most of the people who voted on it actually understand what it is, for starters.
[4775.58 → 4780.08] Because, like, basically, that's, like, this tweet in a nutshell.
[4780.42 → 4787.26] It's like, hey, wouldn't it be better for the common good if we just, like, cured curable blindness so that, like, people could get back to work?
[4787.38 → 4788.98] Like, doesn't that seem like a positive thing?
[4791.58 → 4792.50] I don't know, man.
[4792.74 → 4793.18] I...
[4796.24 → 4797.22] Jimmy for president.
[4797.94 → 4802.90] I think that he should set his sights higher than being the biggest YouTuber.
[4802.90 → 4819.62] I think if there's anyone that has the charisma and has just enough of a no-nonsense, common-sense approach that he could actually disrupt it, this broken system, he's too young.
[4819.68 → 4822.14] Do you have to, like, put your business on hold or anything?
[4822.54 → 4824.18] Well, apparently not.
[4824.84 → 4825.06] Yeah.
[4825.12 → 4826.28] I mean, that was the norm.
[4826.42 → 4827.36] Yeah, we experienced that.
[4827.38 → 4828.52] That was, yeah, that was...
[4828.52 → 4830.00] He could just keep making YouTube videos.
[4830.00 → 4834.04] So, I doubt that would fly.
[4834.80 → 4835.84] I mean, from my understanding...
[4835.84 → 4839.48] President tries to get off White House grounds without the Secret Service stopping him.
[4841.24 → 4842.32] Actual real edition.
[4843.00 → 4843.62] No joke.
[4843.76 → 4845.52] I would watch the s*** of that.
[4845.54 → 4847.46] Yeah, I mean, it would be huge reviews.
[4847.78 → 4848.90] It would be massive reviews.
[4849.34 → 4849.50] Yeah.
[4851.90 → 4853.26] So, I mean, okay, look.
[4853.48 → 4855.06] We've got people talking in the chat, right?
[4855.06 → 4857.62] Like, he would get stopped by the swamp.
[4857.80 → 4859.58] The opposition would stop him.
[4861.42 → 4862.70] He'd get monster votes.
[4863.38 → 4864.22] That's the thing.
[4864.80 → 4865.68] That's the thing.
[4866.18 → 4867.42] Is no matter...
[4867.42 → 4869.12] Free Beast Burger with every vote.
[4869.12 → 4879.42] No matter who you are, I think that, you know, whatever your political leanings are, you could probably use a dose of common sense.
[4879.42 → 4880.16] You know?
[4880.74 → 4887.24] I think that on both sides of the political spectrum, we could all use a little bit more common sense.
[4887.86 → 4889.70] And Jimmy's not perfect.
[4890.26 → 4891.06] I'm not perfect.
[4891.16 → 4892.10] Nobody's perfect.
[4892.50 → 4895.00] So, I'm not saying, he'd fix everything.
[4895.14 → 4896.02] He'd be perfect.
[4896.14 → 4896.92] Perfect president.
[4897.42 → 4898.42] Nothing like that.
[4898.42 → 4902.44] But I think, overall, his heart's in the right place.
[4903.02 → 4912.44] And, you know, my worthless endorsement as a Canadian, being what it is, I support Jimmy for president.
[4914.98 → 4915.46] That's it.
[4915.86 → 4916.88] That's all I have to say about that.
[4917.08 → 4917.20] Wow.
[4917.76 → 4919.46] How old do you have to be president?
[4919.88 → 4920.72] 45, I think.
[4921.04 → 4921.32] 35?
[4921.92 → 4922.10] Yeah.
[4922.24 → 4923.72] So, he's not even eligible for...
[4923.72 → 4924.40] But that's the thing.
[4924.40 → 4925.32] He's got 10 years.
[4925.32 → 4937.36] He's got 10 years for the dumpster fire to get more dumpster fiery, for the polarization to exhaust everyone, and for him to come in and say, I have a better way.
[4938.92 → 4940.30] What about just positivity?
[4940.96 → 4942.38] What about just trying to help people?
[4943.12 → 4947.14] What about seeing problems and going, why isn't this fixed?
[4947.90 → 4949.02] How is this still a problem?
[4949.92 → 4950.94] That's the right attitude.
[4951.84 → 4954.42] And that's what has made him successful so far.
[4954.42 → 4958.00] So, all he has to do is hold on to that for 11 more years.
[4959.44 → 4960.26] 21 more years?
[4960.36 → 4960.82] Whatever it is.
[4960.86 → 4961.68] Apparently, it's 35.
[4961.92 → 4962.36] There you go.
[4964.12 → 4966.42] He's not 14, so...
[4967.24 → 4967.50] Yeah.
[4967.90 → 4969.92] Whatever it works out to.
[4969.98 → 4974.40] He's just got to keep grounded, which is tough.
[4974.84 → 4976.74] I mean, he's going to be the first billionaire YouTuber.
[4977.04 → 4977.62] Mark my words.
[4977.78 → 4978.94] Yeah, but I don't think he's going anywhere.
[4979.40 → 4981.04] Like, anywhere as in away.
[4981.04 → 4981.12] Okay.
[4984.42 → 4985.58] I mean, that's what he tells me.
[4985.90 → 4991.38] But I have told him on multiple occasions, everyone wears out.
[4991.94 → 4992.46] It's tiring.
[4992.76 → 4993.24] You haven't yet.
[4994.52 → 4995.46] You got real close.
[4995.62 → 4996.44] You know I've been close.
[4996.54 → 4996.70] Yeah.
[4997.46 → 4998.94] But you also, like, can't stop.
[4999.62 → 4999.82] Yeah.
[4999.82 → 5001.46] I feel like he has the same type of mentality.
[5001.46 → 5004.78] Yeah.
[5004.98 → 5005.64] We're a lot alike.
[5005.70 → 5006.72] He's just way better than me.
[5008.58 → 5008.94] Yeah.
[5009.04 → 5010.22] And I just have a tech obsession.
[5010.36 → 5014.44] I was going to say, he picked, like, YouTube as his thing in general.
[5014.64 → 5015.38] I didn't pick tech.
[5015.46 → 5016.04] Tech picked me.
[5016.18 → 5016.42] Yeah.
[5016.68 → 5016.88] Yeah.
[5016.88 → 5017.92] I don't make the rules.
[5018.06 → 5024.64] I was lucky enough that tech, I kind of jumped onto it at a time when it was exploding into the mainstream.
[5024.64 → 5029.72] Like, the fact that most people care about a phone at all.
[5029.82 → 5032.92] Like, I'm thinking about when I was a kid, people didn't care about what phone?
[5033.26 → 5034.02] Are you kidding me?
[5034.36 → 5037.18] Like, the thing that you, like, dial like this with the rotary?
[5037.30 → 5037.84] Like, come on.
[5038.22 → 5038.46] Right?
[5038.46 → 5046.54] So, I just happened to be passionate about tech, and tech happened to be at an inflection point where it completely took over our lives.
[5046.64 → 5048.02] And I've ridden that wave.
[5048.42 → 5048.48] Yeah.
[5050.32 → 5051.94] I couldn't play the game like he does.
[5053.94 → 5058.94] What I could play is how to sell a lot of desk pads on LTTstore.com.
[5059.18 → 5059.38] Hey!
[5060.16 → 5061.76] I don't know if you guys noticed this.
[5061.78 → 5062.48] Want me to open one of these?
[5062.62 → 5064.42] I know a lot of you probably did, though.
[5064.42 → 5072.72] But we finally, finally, I'm not talking limited edition, you know, small run desk pads or anything like that.
[5072.78 → 5075.34] Or, you know, special graphics or anything like that.
[5075.40 → 5082.08] We finally launched a new desk pad the same way we did the Northern Lights desk pad.
[5082.34 → 5087.42] I'm talking, I'm talking, look at all these sizes!
[5088.90 → 5089.84] That's right.
[5089.84 → 5093.60] Any size you want, the price is the same.
[5093.60 → 5096.24] $29.99 US.
[5096.66 → 5097.98] And this one's different.
[5098.36 → 5100.84] This is the stealth desk pad.
[5101.08 → 5101.28] Yeah.
[5101.44 → 5102.08] That's right.
[5102.26 → 5102.96] We have received...
[5103.62 → 5103.94] Okay.
[5104.44 → 5106.46] I resisted this for a long time.
[5107.04 → 5107.64] Long time.
[5107.96 → 5114.48] But both internally and from outsiders, people have gone, look, love the quality of the desk pad.
[5114.78 → 5117.66] There's no denying it's a great desk pad.
[5117.74 → 5118.40] For real, though.
[5118.40 → 5121.72] We have 6,171 reviews.
[5121.92 → 5124.44] And our average is five stars.
[5124.66 → 5126.62] These are all real user reviews.
[5126.78 → 5127.62] This is at random.
[5127.98 → 5130.46] I absolutely love this desk pad.
[5131.04 → 5132.20] I love it.
[5132.20 → 5135.84] This is a review of how the courier sucks.
[5135.84 → 5137.12] I love, yeah.
[5137.46 → 5139.34] Finest mouse pad money can buy.
[5139.68 → 5140.88] So satisfied.
[5141.54 → 5141.86] Wow.
[5142.24 → 5145.72] I love that the body of the comment on that one is literally just, wow.
[5146.06 → 5147.48] Well, it's a great desk pad.
[5148.14 → 5153.74] Anyway, the point is, we've had a lot of people say, look, I'd love to have the desk pad, but I want it stealth.
[5153.98 → 5154.46] No graphics.
[5154.46 → 5155.10] So stealth.
[5155.10 → 5157.44] We don't even have a logo on it.
[5157.82 → 5162.04] I'm a little surprised there isn't just like a gray logo, but it would break it up.
[5162.42 → 5163.06] It would break it up.
[5163.12 → 5163.36] I get it.
[5163.36 → 5165.90] We wanted the stealthiest desk pad.
[5166.16 → 5174.24] It's like, while everyone else wants to cram their brand down your throat, we have actually gone in completely the opposite direction.
[5174.92 → 5177.60] Even the box has like barely any, there's, there's.
[5177.66 → 5178.28] Well, there's the side.
[5178.38 → 5179.06] There's the one side.
[5179.16 → 5180.52] Yeah, but most of it's just black.
[5180.74 → 5181.26] That's true.
[5181.26 → 5183.24] Sarah designed that box.
[5183.34 → 5184.42] There is Linus Tech Tips there.
[5184.44 → 5185.72] To be as stealthy as possible.
[5185.88 → 5186.66] This was just black.
[5187.10 → 5194.90] We took our original water bottle design that had Linus Tech Tips down the side, and we moved it to a little tiny LTT on the CMOS battery.
[5195.10 → 5196.24] That's how we roll.
[5196.46 → 5196.66] Yeah.
[5196.78 → 5201.00] So this is the stealthiest, stealthiest desk pad that you've ever seen.
[5201.46 → 5207.20] It looks like a generic no name, but it plays like a primo tier brand name mouse pad.
[5207.40 → 5208.78] White stealth desk pad win.
[5208.84 → 5209.10] Never.
[5209.10 → 5209.42] Never.
[5209.96 → 5211.24] Don't buy a white mouse pad.
[5211.50 → 5212.26] Do not.
[5213.16 → 5218.12] Do yourself and everyone who has to look at your setup a favour by not buying a white desk pad.
[5218.24 → 5218.76] Don't do it.
[5219.28 → 5223.40] And since we're talking about LTT Store, now's a good time to talk about merch messages.
[5223.74 → 5225.02] You guys are probably seeing them.
[5225.10 → 5226.16] Come across the bottom here.
[5226.50 → 5227.68] Our producer Dan, there he is.
[5227.72 → 5237.56] Hi, producer Dan, is going through all of your messages, and the way to send a merch message is to go into LTTStore.com, pick up a desk pad or a water bottle or even just a gift card.
[5237.56 → 5245.36] If you just want to send in a message to the show and Dan might reply to you, if you just have like a shout-out, like, hey, mom, or whatever, you can have it flash down here.
[5245.36 → 5248.06] And he'll select a few them.
[5248.26 → 5249.26] Not too many today, Dan.
[5249.32 → 5250.70] Let's get out of here at a reasonable time.
[5251.32 → 5251.92] No, for real.
[5251.96 → 5253.06] Do it the way you usually do it.
[5253.38 → 5253.54] Yeah.
[5253.60 → 5254.40] It's fine.
[5254.46 → 5254.70] It's fine.
[5254.70 → 5255.72] It's a lot today.
[5255.72 → 5255.80] Okay.
[5256.04 → 5256.36] Okay.
[5256.68 → 5262.76] Well, anyway, you can pick out a handful for us to talk about at the end of the show, maybe respond to.
[5262.80 → 5265.52] Maybe you want to give us a few now, and then we'll do the rest of them at the end.
[5265.78 → 5266.24] Yeah, sure.
[5266.38 → 5266.74] Absolutely.
[5267.40 → 5268.86] I've got a couple curated ones here.
[5268.92 → 5269.68] Let me just keep scrolling.
[5270.68 → 5271.00] Okay.
[5271.04 → 5271.78] This is from Bo.
[5272.04 → 5273.22] Hi, Luke and Linus.
[5273.32 → 5277.20] Just curious to see if you had any memorable arcade moments from back in the day.
[5278.42 → 5279.22] Arcade moments?
[5279.30 → 5279.62] Yeah.
[5279.72 → 5280.44] You have ever been to an arcade?
[5280.66 → 5281.36] Not going to lie.
[5281.50 → 5282.24] I was poor.
[5282.90 → 5284.58] And arcades were very expensive.
[5284.92 → 5285.32] Yep.
[5285.72 → 5297.48] I probably spent a grand total in my life, or my childhood life, of maybe like 20, 30 bucks in the arcade total ever-growing up.
[5298.02 → 5308.48] And that's, I'm like, I'm including like that couple of times that my dad took me to the bar, and we stayed way too long when I was like quite young.
[5308.58 → 5312.28] And somehow, I don't even know why I was in there, but I was in there.
[5312.28 → 5320.76] And you know those chocolates, the square ones that have like the colour on a triangle, and they're gold wrapped, and they're purple and green?
[5320.88 → 5320.96] I think so.
[5320.96 → 5321.16] Yeah, anyway.
[5321.58 → 5323.92] I remember this one time really vividly.
[5323.92 → 5325.46] I had a lot of those.
[5325.46 → 5325.76] I had a lot of those.
[5325.76 → 5328.36] And I played Pac-Man a fair bit.
[5328.48 → 5330.88] I'm including, I'm including everything here.
[5330.96 → 5332.18] Maybe like 20, 30 bucks.
[5332.22 → 5332.62] That's it.
[5332.94 → 5336.78] I suspect I'm pretty similar because of a pretty similar situation.
[5336.78 → 5339.90] And I know we went to Palladium once.
[5340.22 → 5342.58] I went to Palladium a grand total of one time in my life.
[5342.64 → 5343.32] Yeah, me too.
[5343.42 → 5343.84] One time.
[5344.50 → 5344.64] Yeah.
[5344.70 → 5345.86] And it was like kind of cool.
[5346.00 → 5351.08] But I remember even when I was a little kid just being like, you know, if you hung out here for a while, like.
[5351.24 → 5352.80] The money's going away so fast.
[5352.82 → 5353.04] Yeah.
[5353.04 → 5356.08] Like it was shocking how fast the money went away for me.
[5356.16 → 5359.60] I remember like being very young because I don't think Palladium was around for all that long.
[5359.80 → 5368.74] And I remember thinking back then like the speed at which this could be, you know, dumped into an entire video game that you could take home.
[5368.98 → 5377.30] So that's the thing is we're a different generation from the 80s kids who didn't have the same games on their home system.
[5377.38 → 5378.22] We had home consoles.
[5378.42 → 5378.86] That's right.
[5378.92 → 5380.08] We had home consoles.
[5380.08 → 5386.32] So for the price of going to the arcade for like an hour, I could go to.
[5386.64 → 5388.28] Oh, man, it's going to escape me.
[5388.84 → 5391.46] What was my childhood video store called?
[5392.70 → 5394.20] Willow Video Games.
[5394.48 → 5395.38] I know you know yours.
[5395.50 → 5396.20] It's still there.
[5396.34 → 5396.90] That's cheating.
[5397.32 → 5399.42] You drive past it probably on a weekly basis.
[5400.12 → 5401.70] What was mine called, though?
[5401.76 → 5403.08] If you're visiting the area, check it out.
[5403.16 → 5403.74] They're very cool.
[5403.86 → 5404.10] Okay.
[5404.10 → 5405.82] If anyone knows.
[5406.16 → 5406.48] Okay.
[5406.48 → 5409.82] What was the rental store?
[5410.88 → 5412.96] I know the girl who worked there.
[5413.00 → 5413.90] Her name was Michelle.
[5414.32 → 5417.62] I know her name still, but I don't remember what it was called.
[5417.88 → 5418.74] Gone Hollywood Video?
[5418.94 → 5419.62] But it was on.
[5419.70 → 5420.20] No, no.
[5420.26 → 5427.90] It was on the corner by where the Bosley's was in one of the like crappy shopping centres.
[5428.82 → 5430.34] No, it wasn't Blockbuster.
[5430.94 → 5433.50] No, it was a small independent one.
[5433.56 → 5435.62] If anyone remembers in Ladder, okay?
[5435.92 → 5436.66] Jumbo Video?
[5436.86 → 5437.02] Yeah.
[5437.12 → 5437.96] No, no.
[5438.08 → 5438.48] Juniper?
[5438.94 → 5442.18] If anyone gets it, I'll definitely remember it.
[5442.32 → 5444.12] But there's no point guessing, guys.
[5444.16 → 5446.70] If you grew up in Ladder, then you'll know.
[5448.48 → 5449.18] Oh, man.
[5449.46 → 5450.82] This is driving me crazy.
[5451.86 → 5452.36] I have no idea.
[5452.52 → 5453.10] Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[5453.10 → 5454.86] Yeah, obviously you wouldn't know.
[5455.28 → 5456.50] Someone's like, oh, I just had a crush.
[5456.50 → 5457.62] 100%.
[5457.62 → 5460.60] Like, seriously, I was only like 7 or 8, but definitely.
[5461.96 → 5462.50] All right.
[5463.28 → 5465.78] Yeah, this is clearly not going to happen.
[5466.16 → 5466.28] Nope.
[5466.36 → 5467.38] Nope, people are not going to get it.
[5467.42 → 5467.88] That's fine.
[5467.92 → 5468.30] That's fine.
[5468.34 → 5468.80] It doesn't matter.
[5468.88 → 5471.38] The point is, like, never mind buying a game.
[5471.82 → 5472.54] I could rent it.
[5472.54 → 5472.90] He doesn't live there anymore.
[5472.96 → 5473.64] It's not a LOX.
[5473.82 → 5475.60] I could rent it for like 5 bucks.
[5475.68 → 5475.88] Yeah.
[5476.12 → 5477.94] And then I could play it for like 2 days.
[5478.04 → 5479.36] Yeah, I used to rent games.
[5479.58 → 5480.14] Yeah, 100%.
[5480.14 → 5482.96] I would work random odd jobs and then rent games for sure.
[5483.22 → 5483.40] Yeah.
[5483.40 → 5487.08] I am certain I spent more money renting games than I did in arcade.
[5489.00 → 5489.90] For sure, for sure.
[5490.24 → 5491.42] This is driving me crazy.
[5491.62 → 5492.70] I cannot remember.
[5492.80 → 5493.78] You're not going to figure it out.
[5493.84 → 5494.18] I know.
[5494.28 → 5494.92] Let's move on.
[5494.94 → 5495.48] I hate this.
[5495.52 → 5496.18] I'm so mad.
[5496.22 → 5499.44] If you think about it in like an hour when we're still somehow doing the show, you can
[5499.44 → 5500.02] bring it up then.
[5500.12 → 5500.70] Yeah, fine.
[5500.92 → 5501.20] Okay.
[5502.52 → 5502.84] Ugh!
[5503.76 → 5504.46] Okay, fine.
[5504.78 → 5505.62] Hit me with another one.
[5505.72 → 5505.84] Yeah.
[5505.84 → 5507.42] I go in here from Tristan.
[5507.78 → 5510.92] Long time viewer and wanted to say thanks for all the content over the years.
[5511.36 → 5516.94] Is there any obsolete piece of technology that you still use or wish you had been continuing
[5516.94 → 5522.06] or wish you had or wish had been continued as a product?
[5522.62 → 5523.34] And if so, why?
[5523.34 → 5529.76] I mean, I think, man, I was about to say CRTs, but I actually don't miss them at all.
[5529.90 → 5538.72] Now that Olds and like, and especially the kind of filtering that you can do now on an
[5538.72 → 5541.42] OLED, I just, yeah, forget it.
[5541.48 → 5542.30] See you later, CRTs.
[5542.30 → 5544.76] Man, you know what?
[5544.90 → 5545.12] Fine.
[5545.24 → 5545.40] Sure.
[5545.52 → 5545.76] Pebble.
[5546.18 → 5547.06] Pebble smartwatch.
[5547.62 → 5550.14] I wish that they hadn't been acquired.
[5550.44 → 5555.26] I wish that they were still doing their thing because they were the only, just zero bullshit
[5555.26 → 5557.38] approach to building a smartwatch.
[5558.00 → 5559.04] They were affordable.
[5559.54 → 5561.52] They just, they were gone too soon.
[5561.76 → 5562.48] Gone too soon.
[5562.58 → 5562.82] Pebble.
[5563.44 → 5564.12] Bring back Pebble.
[5564.50 → 5569.72] I have, I have something that you're going to say is objectively wrong, and I won't be able
[5569.72 → 5570.96] to strongly argue against.
[5571.20 → 5571.64] You're wrong.
[5571.64 → 5575.32] Um, physical storage medium for games.
[5575.48 → 5575.94] Oh my God.
[5576.20 → 5576.46] Ugh.
[5580.18 → 5581.64] I miss physical storage.
[5583.10 → 5583.90] I miss it.
[5584.66 → 5585.40] I'm not going to lie.
[5585.46 → 5590.80] There was, there was a thing I was reading about where some company figured out how to
[5590.80 → 5594.10] put some insane amount of data storage on an optical disc.
[5595.38 → 5597.26] And they were like, this is going to be the future.
[5597.26 → 5598.88] And I was like, good.
[5599.92 → 5600.80] It's not happening.
[5600.94 → 5601.14] Good.
[5601.14 → 5602.04] It's never coming back.
[5602.28 → 5602.56] Good.
[5602.68 → 5603.38] It's never coming back.
[5603.48 → 5605.06] Everything is going to be as a service.
[5605.18 → 5605.86] You will own nothing.
[5606.06 → 5606.22] I want it.
[5606.82 → 5607.92] You will own nothing.
[5608.04 → 5608.40] Ah!
[5609.32 → 5610.52] And you will be happy about it.
[5610.52 → 5612.78] The fact that he right doesnot make me happy.
[5614.32 → 5614.72] Yeah.
[5614.98 → 5616.24] People keep saying Video land.
[5616.38 → 5621.24] Video land is in Twain, which is within the same as jurisdiction as Ladder.
[5621.24 → 5622.88] Like it's all technically part of Delta.
[5622.88 → 5622.90] Like it's all technically part of Delta.
[5623.12 → 5625.56] But Twain is not Ladder.
[5626.56 → 5630.80] Ladder is a different like geographical part of Delta.
[5632.08 → 5632.64] Sorry.
[5632.64 → 5635.36] They're still trying though.
[5635.36 → 5636.06] Hit me, Dan.
[5636.66 → 5637.18] Okay.
[5637.24 → 5638.32] This one's from Alexander.
[5638.82 → 5639.02] Hey there.
[5639.16 → 5642.62] Last week you all talked about how nice bidets were in Asia.
[5642.96 → 5647.66] I think we Western audiences get a bit spoiled thinking we have all the latest in tech here.
[5647.66 → 5653.84] What does the non-Western world have a leg up on the US slash EU vis-à-vis tech?
[5654.38 → 5655.22] Oh man.
[5655.28 → 5656.98] I mean there are a lot of things.
[5657.22 → 5661.10] Like there are all kinds of like Japan exclusive phones and stuff.
[5661.24 → 5664.24] Just like cool form factors, cool designs, cool features.
[5665.16 → 5668.62] I don't think it's to the same degree now that it was in the past.
[5668.62 → 5684.64] But man, like when broadband internet was happening, when high definition video was first starting out, Japan was so far ahead of the rest of the world that it just blew my mind.
[5684.68 → 5685.80] I'm like, I'm sorry.
[5685.90 → 5689.72] I am just hearing about the existence of high definition video.
[5689.98 → 5695.76] And this has just been a thing for regular Japanese broadcasts for years and years now.
[5696.42 → 5698.30] Well, where's mine?
[5698.62 → 5698.78] Yeah.
[5699.14 → 5699.34] Yeah.
[5700.02 → 5700.42] Yeah.
[5700.42 → 5700.72] I don't know.
[5700.80 → 5707.00] There's a when you, when you travel a bit, stuff changes a lot more than I would have expected.
[5707.34 → 5713.92] Like when I, when I first started travelling for work, the only difference I really expected was like, oh, we're going to run into language barrier stuff.
[5713.92 → 5716.14] But the world's so connected these days.
[5716.26 → 5717.22] Everyone shares everything.
[5717.30 → 5720.02] A lot of the processes for how things are going to work are just going to be figured out.
[5720.02 → 5721.62] Translate what I'm about to say to Chinese.
[5721.98 → 5722.14] Yeah.
[5722.24 → 5723.58] That'll be the only thing I have to do.
[5723.62 → 5724.68] And that's a fun activity.
[5724.78 → 5726.30] I actually genuinely really enjoy that.
[5726.30 → 5729.44] But there's a lot more funky stuff.
[5730.02 → 5736.08] Like if I remember correctly, again, in Japan, you carry around like a stamp that's unique to you or maybe don't carry it around.
[5736.16 → 5740.40] But for like legal documents and stuff, you use your like unique stamp thing.
[5740.40 → 5740.70] Oh, that's cool.
[5740.86 → 5741.46] I've never heard of that.
[5741.64 → 5742.98] That might be totally wrong.
[5743.04 → 5744.04] I'm sorry if I butchered that.
[5744.04 → 5749.02] And a lot of other countries will have like some little random unique thing to them.
[5750.16 → 5753.32] And sometimes they make a lot of sense and sometimes they don't.
[5753.46 → 5754.28] Yeah, this is hilarious.
[5756.54 → 5761.58] IR FTW says NHK, Japan's national broadcaster for TV, broadcasts in 8K for some program.
[5762.78 → 5763.54] That's crazy.
[5763.66 → 5763.88] Okay.
[5763.88 → 5769.90] One more.
[5771.84 → 5772.20] Sure.
[5772.38 → 5772.78] Absolutely.
[5773.62 → 5775.16] I've got one here from Andrew.
[5776.16 → 5778.62] GPUs used to have video capture built in.
[5778.74 → 5781.12] I had a GeForce 4 with S video in.
[5781.60 → 5787.06] With the hardware encoding GPUs have baked in these days, it seems like a no-brainer for them to include capture as well.
[5787.32 → 5788.84] Why do you think they don't include it?
[5788.84 → 5790.18] The reason is DRM.
[5790.50 → 5790.92] That's why.
[5791.72 → 5794.42] There was a whole thing.
[5794.84 → 5801.76] You know if you want to go down a rabbit hole for how lobbying destroys tech innovation, go look up Cable Card.
[5802.46 → 5810.50] So there was a whole standard that existed and was built to do exactly what you're talking about.
[5810.50 → 5818.96] To allow content broadcasters to encrypt their signals so that they could actually, you know, protect their copyrighted content.
[5819.44 → 5837.00] But also allow users to install a card in their computer that could be loaded with this decryption module so that they could DVR on a computer instead of having to deal with a VHS player or a DVHS player.
[5837.00 → 5840.20] We did a video about DVHS recently, which is super cool.
[5840.50 → 5848.02] And basically, because of lobbying efforts, the whole thing got shut down.
[5848.18 → 5862.36] None of the cable companies wanted to support it because they would rather lease you a box that you don't own rather than have you own your computer and capture your content there where it can be easily viewed again.
[5863.08 → 5864.74] So that's what happens.
[5865.80 → 5866.54] Yeah, it sucks.
[5866.66 → 5868.16] Cable Card looked very promising.
[5868.16 → 5869.12] Cable Card was super cool.
[5869.12 → 5871.70] I was super into, like, Media Centre PCs.
[5872.02 → 5880.44] Like, we had one up until we couldn't anymore because there were no longer any unencrypted broadcasts at, like, my parents' place.
[5881.68 → 5882.58] Yeah, sucked.
[5883.66 → 5884.74] Yeah, Cable Card was sweet.
[5884.82 → 5885.26] Not cool.
[5885.56 → 5888.00] That was a very fun era to be into PCs.
[5888.22 → 5888.76] Yeah, for sure.
[5888.78 → 5889.90] There was just so many options.
[5889.90 → 5891.04] Yeah, it was awesome.
[5891.30 → 5891.42] Yeah.
[5891.58 → 5898.98] My first real GPU, like, gaming GPU, was an in Wonder 9600 Pro.
[5899.22 → 5903.26] I paid extra for the in Wonder so that I could, like, capture video.
[5903.26 → 5905.04] I didn't end up using it that much.
[5905.12 → 5906.52] But, man, that remote was sick.
[5908.52 → 5911.36] I got – this is totally aggressively off-topic.
[5911.48 → 5912.70] I don't know why I just thought about this.
[5912.70 → 5919.98] But I was reminded fairly recently about a funny story of a tech goof back in the day.
[5920.62 → 5927.54] I was a young lad, and I was going to a girl's house that I was interested in.
[5927.54 → 5937.86] And I wanted to bring along my – I don't remember which game it was, but I had a disc, a CD for a Star Wars video game.
[5938.54 → 5942.52] And I liked one of the music tracks for the Star Wars video game.
[5943.14 → 5949.64] So I said I would bring it along because I just assumed, well, like, the music track is on the disc.
[5949.76 → 5952.88] So I can just put it in something that can play music, and it'll just play, right?
[5952.96 → 5953.68] Like, that makes sense.
[5953.94 → 5954.16] Yeah.
[5954.30 → 5955.14] The file's on there.
[5955.52 → 5956.00] It'll just work.
[5956.00 → 5960.80] So we get there, and I put it in her, like, dad's home theatre setup.
[5961.24 → 5962.20] It's a video game.
[5962.88 → 5963.48] I see.
[5963.92 → 5964.96] It doesn't play.
[5965.38 → 5967.42] And I'm like, oh, it should definitely work.
[5967.46 → 5968.10] The file's on there.
[5968.12 → 5969.06] I know what I'm talking about.
[5969.06 → 5971.06] And the dad's just like –
[5971.06 → 5975.44] Very politely, like, you're an idiot.
[5975.64 → 5975.98] Stop.
[5976.34 → 5977.36] I was like, okay.
[5977.76 → 5978.06] Yeah.
[5978.32 → 5979.56] You were done.
[5980.02 → 5981.84] You didn't impress that dad.
[5982.12 → 5982.52] No.
[5984.24 → 5985.30] That was funny, though.
[5985.30 → 5986.60] People are saying it's Video land.
[5987.44 → 5993.80] Video land is apparently what's there now or recently, but I don't think it was called that.
[5993.94 → 5996.40] This signage looks pretty new.
[5996.94 → 5998.20] Yeah, I don't think that was it.
[5999.04 → 6000.50] I think it used to be called something else.
[6001.24 → 6003.14] You guys – oh, it's Jiu-jitsu something now.
[6003.14 → 6004.32] Oh, that's interesting.
[6004.42 → 6005.32] Depending on – wow.
[6005.76 → 6007.28] Whoever drove through – this is kind of cool.
[6007.74 → 6014.16] Whoever drove through recently, whichever Google Street View car went through, only did the main road.
[6015.16 → 6016.16] They – whoop.
[6016.86 → 6017.52] Yeah, see that?
[6017.90 → 6020.22] Didn't do the parking lot.
[6020.72 → 6021.10] Whoa.
[6021.38 → 6021.82] Interesting.
[6022.24 → 6022.34] Whoa.
[6022.80 → 6023.18] Hey.
[6023.42 → 6023.74] There you go.
[6023.74 → 6024.14] That's interesting.
[6024.14 → 6025.00] Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[6025.48 → 6027.74] Someone said apparently some game disc could do that.
[6027.80 → 6033.32] That's interesting because I wonder if Youngmi was right and his setup wasn't compatible or something.
[6033.46 → 6033.76] I don't know.
[6033.88 → 6035.14] That is the right address, though.
[6035.62 → 6036.54] That is the right address.
[6037.70 → 6038.70] Willow Video, probably not.
[6038.96 → 6040.70] Willow Video did have multiple locations.
[6041.50 → 6041.76] Did they?
[6042.00 → 6043.30] Yeah, and they weren't all in Willow.
[6044.00 → 6044.26] Oh.
[6044.70 → 6045.12] I don't know.
[6045.18 → 6045.90] I just don't remember.
[6047.54 → 6048.84] I mean, maybe it was Video land.
[6049.06 → 6049.44] I don't know.
[6050.62 → 6050.98] All right.
[6051.06 → 6051.68] Back to topics.
[6051.68 → 6051.80] Yeah.
[6054.14 → 6054.78] Yes.
[6055.68 → 6056.40] Hit me.
[6056.76 → 6059.12] I had to scroll way up.
[6059.32 → 6060.78] We've done some stuff today.
[6063.62 → 6066.36] Oh, here's one.
[6066.76 → 6069.96] Microsoft launches new AI-enabled Bing and Teams.
[6070.48 → 6072.32] I didn't see the Teams one coming, actually.
[6072.82 → 6078.66] Microsoft launched a new ChatGPT-enabled version of Bing today and then immediately took it down.
[6078.66 → 6079.16] Sick.
[6079.16 → 6084.12] Several users report finding the Bing interface suddenly changed earlier today with a message
[6084.12 → 6086.62] introducing visitors to the new Bing.
[6086.96 → 6091.20] Before it was taken down, users determined that the new Bing can apparently respond to
[6091.20 → 6096.44] questions in a conversational manner and cite its sources, though a disclaimer warns that
[6096.44 → 6098.74] mistakes and inaccuracies are possible.
[6098.74 → 6099.02] Wow.
[6099.24 → 6100.04] That's pretty cool.
[6100.10 → 6101.82] Which is the way to do it, honestly.
[6102.36 → 6110.24] Microsoft also apparently intentionally released a new paid tier for a ChatGPT 3.5-enabled version
[6110.24 → 6111.48] of MS Teams.
[6111.48 → 6118.02] It includes automatic note-taking and intelligent recap features, as well as safeguards like automatic
[6118.02 → 6120.98] watermarking and labelling of sensitive content.
[6120.98 → 6126.64] Meanwhile, Google has invested in an AI startup headed by former open AI researchers to the
[6126.64 → 6128.34] tune of $300 million.
[6128.34 → 6132.56] Will this increase competition in the search engine space?
[6132.74 → 6134.56] What will that competition look like?
[6135.46 → 6138.10] It'll absolutely increase competition in the search engine space.
[6138.10 → 6142.48] And I think that competition looks like $300 million so far.
[6142.68 → 6144.10] Google is...
[6144.10 → 6145.24] Wow.
[6145.58 → 6146.90] Gotta be freaking out.
[6149.60 → 6157.18] But I think Microsoft is hopefully going to be wise enough to not Halo Infinite, their new Bing search,
[6157.54 → 6160.62] and release it wildly before it's ready.
[6162.72 → 6166.70] And yeah, I suspect that was a natural mistake.
[6166.70 → 6170.42] The Microsoft Teams thing is very intriguing to me.
[6170.42 → 6171.42] Yeah, I didn't see that part coming.
[6171.66 → 6178.58] I haven't checked it yet, but I'm wondering if it's on top of already having a business plan for Teams.
[6179.40 → 6180.80] I wonder if you have to pay even more.
[6183.18 → 6187.54] I believe it can actually do even more than what we noted here as well.
[6188.04 → 6190.92] I think it can help with setting up meetings.
[6190.92 → 6197.28] I know it can track notes and stuff, but I believe it helps with coordination of meeting planning,
[6197.64 → 6199.58] like picking a time and stuff like that.
[6199.74 → 6200.42] I'm not certain.
[6200.84 → 6203.28] I just skimmed an article earlier today.
[6205.16 → 6206.10] That's super cool.
[6206.34 → 6207.56] But it'll be interesting.
[6207.78 → 6208.12] I don't know.
[6210.28 → 6210.90] It's interesting.
[6211.60 → 6213.96] AI creates 3D videos and...
[6213.96 → 6214.54] Oh, hold on.
[6214.66 → 6216.12] Apparently it was Video Land.
[6216.12 → 6219.68] I just really, really, really can't remember the name.
[6220.48 → 6222.96] It was run by someone named Michelle for 30 years.
[6223.28 → 6225.68] I was going to say, you were a little focused on somebody else, I think.
[6226.54 → 6226.96] What's that?
[6229.42 → 6230.20] The teller?
[6230.92 → 6233.44] You're a little more focused on her than the name of the store.
[6233.46 → 6234.48] No, no, that's the name I gave before.
[6234.94 → 6235.32] I know.
[6235.58 → 6236.88] That's my point.
[6237.22 → 6239.52] You were more focused on the lady than the store itself.
[6239.52 → 6245.40] Oh, I should have known the name of the store because that was where, even when she wasn't
[6245.40 → 6246.38] working the counter anymore.
[6246.74 → 6247.68] At least, I don't know.
[6247.72 → 6248.18] Maybe it was her.
[6248.22 → 6249.18] Maybe it was someone else named Michelle.
[6249.28 → 6250.28] I actually don't know.
[6250.70 → 6252.92] Because clearly, I don't even remember the name of it.
[6253.04 → 6254.28] But that was the place.
[6254.72 → 6256.68] And apparently it was called Video Land Forever.
[6257.28 → 6258.20] So there you go.
[6258.50 → 6260.70] As early as 1990, it was called Video Land.
[6260.80 → 6261.30] Thank you.
[6261.64 → 6263.76] Hey, Leon, in the float plane chat.
[6264.76 → 6268.24] This is from the Delta Optimist in 1990.
[6269.52 → 6270.72] Hello?
[6270.72 → 6271.64] Hot rental.
[6273.60 → 6274.44] A must.
[6274.58 → 6275.28] USA Today.
[6276.80 → 6277.88] What is this?
[6278.00 → 6278.62] What is this?
[6278.70 → 6278.78] Yeah.
[6278.84 → 6279.88] Hot rental properties?
[6280.74 → 6280.94] Wait.
[6281.22 → 6282.90] This is places you could go to.
[6283.34 → 6283.80] So wait.
[6284.06 → 6284.58] This was how.
[6284.72 → 6288.14] So Touchstone is promoting.
[6288.88 → 6289.40] Wow.
[6290.40 → 6294.76] The movie and saying, here's all the places you can go rent it.
[6295.72 → 6296.14] What?
[6297.08 → 6298.98] What was Video Fantasies?
[6299.52 → 6305.34] That sounds like they probably sold a wide range of potential videos for a wide range
[6305.34 → 6305.76] of ages.
[6306.64 → 6308.82] They sure probably widely did.
[6308.98 → 6309.58] Okay, cool.
[6309.66 → 6310.46] What were we talking about again?
[6311.52 → 6311.96] Anything.
[6312.16 → 6313.26] We can go to any other topic.
[6314.28 → 6315.06] Yeah, I don't know.
[6315.10 → 6316.64] I think this one's kind of boring.
[6317.06 → 6318.54] Ah, but we have a new game to play.
[6318.54 → 6318.68] Okay.
[6318.68 → 6320.68] And this comes courtesy of our Sancho writer.
[6321.28 → 6329.46] This one is, the game is apparently that I have to guess which Linus recording is actually
[6329.46 → 6332.08] me and which one was generated by an AI.
[6332.42 → 6332.74] Oh.
[6333.24 → 6333.66] You ready?
[6333.88 → 6334.22] Okay.
[6334.22 → 6334.66] Okay.
[6335.60 → 6336.94] So hold on a second.
[6337.04 → 6337.28] I don't know.
[6337.40 → 6337.52] Maybe.
[6337.58 → 6338.58] Do I guess as well?
[6338.66 → 6341.26] I'm not going to look at the details of the topic.
[6341.66 → 6344.04] So Dan, do you know anything about this?
[6344.18 → 6347.58] I have the cheat sheet of what is real and not.
[6347.68 → 6347.86] Okay.
[6347.96 → 6348.84] So there's nothing.
[6348.96 → 6350.80] So we can look at everything that's in the doc?
[6350.96 → 6351.68] Apparently, yes.
[6351.76 → 6351.92] Yeah.
[6351.92 → 6352.12] Okay.
[6352.12 → 6353.08] You just pull one up.
[6353.32 → 6354.78] I don't know if they have sound or not.
[6354.82 → 6355.72] I've never heard these.
[6355.76 → 6356.00] Okay.
[6356.14 → 6356.32] I've seen them.
[6356.68 → 6360.44] But if you pull one up, I'll unmute your laptop, and then we can throw that out.
[6360.78 → 6361.14] Okay.
[6361.30 → 6361.98] I'm not going to be able to hear it.
[6361.98 → 6362.68] It's all you.
[6362.68 → 6367.96] On February 2nd, Reddit user Prod by Sci Tech posted a damning, never before heard recording
[6367.96 → 6373.54] of the WAN show where we discussed our vocal support for big tech monopolies and our
[6373.54 → 6375.70] disdain for the everyday consumer.
[6375.94 → 6376.10] Screw them.
[6376.10 → 6383.16] I guess I should bring up the original Reddit post here and unmute my laptop, which is...
[6383.16 → 6384.06] I have to do that.
[6384.70 → 6385.02] Okay.
[6385.10 → 6386.44] I mean, you don't have to go to the page.
[6386.70 → 6386.86] Let's...
[6386.86 → 6387.02] Okay.
[6387.08 → 6387.60] You ready, Luke?
[6387.78 → 6388.44] I think that's it.
[6388.60 → 6390.38] If you can make it so I can hear it too, that would be great.
[6390.48 → 6391.70] I think you should both be able to hear it.
[6391.74 → 6392.32] We'll double-check.
[6392.50 → 6392.62] Okay.
[6393.38 → 6394.60] In the news this week...
[6394.60 → 6395.26] We have sound.
[6395.26 → 6396.30] I can't hear anything.
[6396.52 → 6396.64] Okay.
[6396.64 → 6397.22] One moment.
[6397.66 → 6398.18] But...
[6398.18 → 6400.16] Unmute the thing.
[6401.74 → 6402.74] Can I click it again?
[6403.02 → 6403.20] Yeah.
[6403.26 → 6403.44] Try.
[6404.60 → 6405.60] In the news this week...
[6405.60 → 6406.74] We're supposed to be able to hear that.
[6407.22 → 6407.82] Nothing for me.
[6407.84 → 6408.58] Oh, it's here.
[6408.90 → 6409.70] Oh, there we go.
[6410.42 → 6410.80] There we go.
[6410.80 → 6411.28] Ah, okay.
[6411.36 → 6412.12] Let's try one more time.
[6412.32 → 6412.60] All right.
[6412.64 → 6413.00] One more time.
[6413.02 → 6414.96] In the news this week, Samsung.
[6415.98 → 6421.00] Samsung has been caught abusing patent law in an attempt to cripple smaller competitors'
[6421.22 → 6423.00] ability to repair mobile devices.
[6423.34 → 6424.04] This all sounds fake.
[6424.04 → 6425.40] Warning, there's a hot take ahead.
[6425.60 → 6426.80] Viewer, be warned.
[6427.68 → 6432.90] I don't think there's anything morally or legally wrong with what Samsung is doing here.
[6433.30 → 6434.78] It's Samsung's patent.
[6435.60 → 6437.26] Let them enforce it.
[6437.48 → 6439.12] That shouldn't be a hot take.
[6439.44 → 6441.78] I think that Samsung is well within their right.
[6441.92 → 6442.10] Yeah.
[6442.22 → 6446.26] And if people want to complain, go make your own technology.
[6446.64 → 6450.48] It's not Samsung's fault that there's no competition in the market.
[6450.66 → 6452.24] It's just capitalism.
[6452.58 → 6453.22] Figure it out.
[6453.22 → 6458.30] I want to see these big companies, these big manufacturers take on the smallest possible
[6458.30 → 6464.34] entities so they can form these huge monopolistic Goliaths that can strip the average American
[6464.34 → 6465.62] of every last penny.
[6465.74 → 6466.58] No, but I agree.
[6466.58 → 6471.52] This makes me so mad because for some reason, people just have the worst takes on this.
[6471.90 → 6474.64] I get so mad hearing this.
[6474.78 → 6476.10] It's literal garbage.
[6476.24 → 6480.90] I saw this tweet this week and this actual moron said, and I quote, tech companies own
[6480.90 → 6481.94] way too much.
[6482.02 → 6483.30] They need to be regulated.
[6483.30 → 6487.12] When I read this, I almost deleted Twitter.
[6487.82 → 6492.28] I wanted to reply and tell this guy, actually, no, they should own more.
[6492.54 → 6493.00] Yeah, yeah.
[6493.20 → 6496.64] Elon Musk should probably own his own chunk of the US government at this rate.
[6496.76 → 6498.80] It's not like they're doing a good job without him.
[6498.80 → 6499.40] Mm-hmm.
[6502.46 → 6502.90] Okay.
[6504.96 → 6506.86] I don't know if it's just because it's me.
[6507.02 → 6511.58] I suspect other people might maybe hear it better.
[6511.80 → 6513.86] That didn't sound like us at all, in my opinion.
[6514.84 → 6515.28] Okay.
[6515.46 → 6522.68] There were some breaths and non-word-based reactions that my version had that I actually think were
[6522.68 → 6523.16] quite good.
[6523.30 → 6524.70] They sounded like exact copies.
[6525.16 → 6525.56] Okay.
[6525.56 → 6531.78] But it sounded like each of them had a strong, Midwestern American accent.
[6532.18 → 6532.46] Okay.
[6532.52 → 6533.50] That was clearly not us.
[6533.58 → 6535.68] So the clip is fake, obviously.
[6536.00 → 6540.86] It's a joke conversation created using Eleven Labs voice synthesization AI.
[6541.32 → 6545.90] According to the original poster, it was trained using just 30-second samples of each voice.
[6546.10 → 6553.38] Now, considering that, it's pretty close, and it took about an hour to create.
[6553.38 → 6558.76] Similar AI voice synthesizers, like Microsoft's recently released Val-E, can apparently use
[6558.76 → 6561.90] samples as short as three seconds to create passable imitations.
[6562.48 → 6567.20] Our writer's note here is that while the text was clearly pre-written, the UMS and stutters
[6567.20 → 6571.02] are apparently randomly generated, which is pretty cool.
[6571.28 → 6578.00] So was that completely fake, or were there bits and pieces of things we'd actually said in there?
[6578.00 → 6580.56] Do you know Mr. Cheat Sheet?
[6581.46 → 6581.82] No.
[6581.98 → 6586.00] I think the cheat sheet is later for the guessing game.
[6586.62 → 6586.88] Oh!
[6586.88 → 6588.04] Oh, I thought that was it.
[6588.08 → 6588.76] So there you are.
[6588.86 → 6591.80] Here, no, that one was fake, and that's in the thing.
[6592.14 → 6594.36] These are the ones that you have to pick.
[6594.48 → 6595.18] Okay, here we go.
[6595.18 → 6596.20] So that was an example.
[6596.46 → 6598.62] Okay, so I should play Fear?
[6599.48 → 6599.88] Yep.
[6599.98 → 6600.18] Okay.
[6600.18 → 6601.60] Let's make sure this is unmuted.
[6601.70 → 6602.48] We can look at your face.
[6602.52 → 6603.48] We don't have to see the laptop.
[6603.96 → 6604.22] Okay.
[6604.22 → 6605.54] Um, I think this should work.
[6605.62 → 6606.80] Hopefully it's not going to be too loud.
[6607.22 → 6607.48] Okay.
[6607.58 → 6608.54] That one was pretty quiet.
[6608.84 → 6610.06] Fear.mp3.
[6611.06 → 6611.58] Play it.
[6612.74 → 6616.98] One of the best pieces of parenting advice I ever got was you have to hit them while they're
[6616.98 → 6617.30] young.
[6617.68 → 6619.74] They fear you, but they don't remember why.
[6621.40 → 6622.10] All right.
[6622.46 → 6623.44] Okay, so wait.
[6623.48 → 6624.70] Who is supposed to guess?
[6625.00 → 6626.88] I have absolutely no idea.
[6626.88 → 6627.88] Okay.
[6633.88 → 6637.26] Okay, it sounded like you were, like, chewing on something, or you had a mask on.
[6637.36 → 6639.18] Okay, I don't think we should be allowed to look at chat.
[6639.62 → 6640.76] I think we're going to have to...
[6640.76 → 6641.04] Okay.
[6641.32 → 6644.26] I think I instinctively did that, so I'm going to have to hide my screen.
[6644.44 → 6646.02] Yeah, I'm putting away chat.
[6648.24 → 6650.86] I remember clearly saying that.
[6650.86 → 6652.12] So, yes.
[6652.48 → 6656.86] Um, I actually have pretty excellent recall for things that I have said.
[6657.64 → 6662.72] Um, obviously, you know, not remembering the name of the video store that I rented things
[6662.72 → 6668.36] from when I was a child did not, um, probably give you guys a lot of confidence in my, in
[6668.36 → 6669.14] my memory.
[6669.60 → 6673.04] Uh, but things that I have written, things that I have read, things I've said and things
[6673.04 → 6677.34] I've heard, I'm usually pretty good at least going, that rings a bell.
[6677.34 → 6680.48] Um, that one, for sure, that wasn't even that long ago.
[6680.56 → 6682.44] I know for a fact that I, I said that.
[6682.88 → 6692.22] But, what I don't know is if these are real quotes that are simply either run through a
[6692.22 → 6693.90] synthesizer or not.
[6694.08 → 6696.88] I'm going to say, was synthesized.
[6698.72 → 6699.72] Luke, do you have a take?
[6699.72 → 6704.50] Um, just for funnies, I'll say it, it wasn't, but he's, like, wearing a mask or something
[6704.50 → 6706.14] like that, because it definitely sounded muffled.
[6706.14 → 6707.46] So you're both saying it wasn't?
[6707.86 → 6709.64] I'm saying it was synthesized.
[6709.74 → 6709.90] Okay.
[6710.02 → 6711.10] But it was definitely, because.
[6711.34 → 6711.76] A real quote.
[6711.76 → 6715.86] Or it's, or it's like a poor quality recording, but I definitely said that.
[6715.98 → 6716.18] Yeah.
[6716.38 → 6718.84] I'm, I would also say that he definitely said that.
[6719.20 → 6719.44] Okay.
[6719.54 → 6720.78] So, I don't know.
[6720.80 → 6721.94] Do I give them to you one by one?
[6722.00 → 6722.28] Yeah, yeah.
[6722.34 → 6722.74] Yeah, sure.
[6722.88 → 6723.00] One by one.
[6723.12 → 6724.74] So, that was real.
[6725.24 → 6725.48] Yes.
[6725.48 → 6726.88] That was, that was not fake.
[6727.02 → 6727.96] Oh, so it just.
[6728.12 → 6731.14] That was, that's what you sound like to everybody around you all the time.
[6731.94 → 6734.84] Was he, do you know, was he, like, wearing a mask or something?
[6734.84 → 6735.94] I have absolutely no idea.
[6736.06 → 6737.20] I just have a piece of paper.
[6737.50 → 6737.52] Sure.
[6737.70 → 6737.90] Yeah.
[6739.16 → 6740.26] There's a reveal here.
[6741.02 → 6741.20] Oh.
[6741.34 → 6743.62] One of the best pieces of parenting advice I ever got.
[6743.62 → 6744.08] I was wearing a mask.
[6744.08 → 6745.76] Because you have to hit them while they're young.
[6746.12 → 6746.48] Okay?
[6746.86 → 6749.72] That way, they fear you, but they don't remember why.
[6750.12 → 6750.48] Okay.
[6750.72 → 6750.92] Yeah.
[6751.12 → 6751.90] Hold on a second.
[6752.10 → 6752.22] This.
[6754.36 → 6754.76] Alright.
[6755.02 → 6755.24] Alright.
[6755.48 → 6755.68] Alright.
[6756.24 → 6756.60] Good.
[6756.86 → 6757.08] Yeah.
[6757.30 → 6757.98] You got the mask.
[6758.34 → 6758.70] Okay.
[6758.70 → 6759.14] Alright.
[6760.40 → 6763.40] I'm still giving myself half a point for that, because I knew there was something wrong
[6763.40 → 6764.98] with it, but you nailed the mask.
[6765.14 → 6767.00] That's, Luke's ahead, for sure.
[6767.24 → 6768.04] So, one zip.
[6768.34 → 6768.90] Let's go.
[6770.20 → 6771.28] You ready for the next one?
[6771.28 → 6773.18] This one's called Competitive.
[6774.06 → 6774.86] It's spelled wrong.
[6775.00 → 6778.54] I'm sure that's for a reason, because the land writer doesn't actually spell things wrong
[6778.54 → 6779.12] very often.
[6779.66 → 6784.32] This device I would never buy is competitive with another device I would never buy.
[6786.80 → 6787.40] Wrong.
[6787.68 → 6788.58] Fake news.
[6789.10 → 6789.66] Generated.
[6790.50 → 6791.06] Incorrect.
[6791.78 → 6792.12] False.
[6792.22 → 6796.86] This device I would never buy is competitive with another device I would never buy.
[6797.14 → 6799.72] This audio clip I would never vote for.
[6799.72 → 6800.28] Okay.
[6800.42 → 6801.14] I think fake.
[6801.44 → 6801.88] It's fake.
[6802.50 → 6803.08] Final answer?
[6803.22 → 6803.42] Yes.
[6803.54 → 6804.58] It is fake.
[6804.72 → 6804.92] Yeah.
[6805.06 → 6805.24] Okay.
[6805.34 → 6806.68] It is a quote from Linus, however.
[6807.24 → 6807.52] Okay.
[6807.60 → 6809.10] That's what was...
[6809.10 → 6811.82] See, that's what was throwing me off a little bit.
[6811.86 → 6812.60] So, here's the thing.
[6812.70 → 6814.22] I don't hear myself.
[6814.70 → 6816.86] And I don't watch my videos.
[6816.86 → 6822.54] So, I don't actually listen to my own voice pretty much at all.
[6824.32 → 6825.92] Yeah, but that one has an accent.
[6826.42 → 6827.40] I mean...
[6827.40 → 6830.16] But I remember saying that, so it made me question it.
[6830.24 → 6830.48] Okay.
[6830.50 → 6831.50] Because I definitely said that.
[6831.50 → 6835.36] I think that probably helps, because I don't watch your videos, man.
[6835.60 → 6836.40] Sapphire panels.
[6836.52 → 6836.96] Let's go.
[6836.96 → 6845.52] Using a massive panel of pure sapphire for the front of a phone would be a little bit stupid.
[6847.70 → 6848.08] Fake.
[6848.08 → 6848.12] Fake.
[6849.30 → 6850.80] I'm just going to let Luke play the game.
[6851.06 → 6851.56] I give up.
[6852.14 → 6852.56] It's fake.
[6852.78 → 6853.82] You give up after two?
[6853.98 → 6854.34] It's fake.
[6854.44 → 6855.22] I give up after two.
[6855.30 → 6856.16] Luke's going to play the game.
[6856.90 → 6857.22] Hit us.
[6859.94 → 6860.88] You have to do it.
[6860.98 → 6861.92] No, tell me if it's fake.
[6862.00 → 6862.26] Oh!
[6862.66 → 6863.34] Yeah, that was fake.
[6863.44 → 6863.68] Okay.
[6863.82 → 6864.10] All right.
[6864.32 → 6865.14] Go back and watch.
[6865.16 → 6865.66] Hit us.
[6865.78 → 6867.98] You have to do it is amazing.
[6870.34 → 6871.94] That's going to be in a future one of these.
[6872.66 → 6873.24] Okay, ready?
[6874.02 → 6877.74] Now go listen to the last 20 seconds or so of this video and think of penises this time.
[6878.08 → 6878.56] You're welcome.
[6878.88 → 6879.10] Real.
[6879.50 → 6880.56] That's definitely real.
[6880.98 → 6881.38] Correct.
[6884.26 → 6886.66] I have said some really outlandish things.
[6887.76 → 6889.68] We have some very good video editors.
[6890.58 → 6890.98] Yeah.
[6891.80 → 6893.52] Well, no, I just said that.
[6893.64 → 6894.60] That was not edited.
[6894.86 → 6895.26] Oh, boy.
[6895.56 → 6896.58] That's the thing I said.
[6896.68 → 6896.86] Okay.
[6896.86 → 6897.20] Definitely.
[6897.20 → 6904.80] Because I was talking about a full HD product of some sort, and I kept referring to its,
[6904.80 → 6910.06] like, describing its image quality and, or like, talking about it as, like, 1080p-ness.
[6910.40 → 6915.48] And then at the end of the video, I'm like, okay, now go back and pretend I said 1080p-ness
[6915.48 → 6916.50] every time.
[6916.72 → 6918.18] That was the context for that.
[6918.94 → 6919.24] Okay.
[6919.70 → 6920.90] Lazy.mp3.
[6920.90 → 6927.06] Sometimes the obvious product is the right one.
[6927.46 → 6927.62] Fake.
[6927.62 → 6928.86] Other times it's the lazy one.
[6928.86 → 6928.96] Fake.
[6930.36 → 6931.80] That's definitely a thing I said.
[6931.88 → 6934.54] That's a quote from a recent video, but I think Luke's right.
[6934.58 → 6934.68] Fake.
[6934.68 → 6935.28] It's fake.
[6935.66 → 6935.92] Okay.
[6936.12 → 6936.96] It's too easy.
[6937.12 → 6940.86] So we can, so basically what you're saying is we can do this pretty well.
[6941.14 → 6942.24] Daddy.mp3.
[6942.24 → 6942.56] They might get harder.
[6942.96 → 6943.40] Oh, my.
[6944.02 → 6946.10] Daddy's going on a dangerous mission to shoot his employees.
[6947.92 → 6950.06] Uh, hold on.
[6950.50 → 6952.60] Daddy's going on a dangerous mission to shoot his employees.
[6953.92 → 6954.36] Okay.
[6954.48 → 6956.60] I, um, I don't remember ever saying that.
[6956.76 → 6959.90] Unless you mixed your voice profile with Ben Shapiro, that's not you.
[6962.16 → 6964.46] I don't remember ever saying that, so I'm going to say fake.
[6966.14 → 6967.28] Uh, that was number seven?
[6967.50 → 6967.70] Yeah.
[6968.86 → 6969.48] Red screen?
[6969.64 → 6970.20] That was seven.
[6970.64 → 6971.38] No, that was Daddy.
[6971.38 → 6973.44] Uh, apparently that is a quote from Linus.
[6973.70 → 6973.92] What?
[6973.96 → 6974.72] Uh, but it was fake.
[6974.72 → 6975.38] No, it's fake.
[6975.60 → 6976.36] I said that?
[6976.74 → 6977.90] I don't know what you said.
[6977.98 → 6978.26] Apparently.
[6978.52 → 6979.68] When the hell did I say that?
[6979.76 → 6981.82] Daddy's going on a mission to shoot his employees?
[6982.74 → 6985.56] You probably had, like, some prop gun or something you're just messing around with.
[6985.58 → 6988.10] Or, or, like, shooting with a camera?
[6988.24 → 6988.90] Yeah, I don't remember that.
[6988.90 → 6989.30] Or that.
[6989.46 → 6989.80] Yeah, yeah.
[6989.84 → 6989.86] Red screen.
[6989.86 → 6992.06] Well, I've never had a computer red screen before.
[6993.28 → 6993.64] Fake.
[6994.18 → 6994.90] There you go.
[6995.00 → 6995.40] Very good.
[6995.42 → 6996.54] Okay, I think I'm getting better at this.
[6996.58 → 6996.80] Eight.
[6997.88 → 6998.20] Comments.
[6999.34 → 6999.90] Oh, no.
[6999.90 → 7004.22] You know, I should really be sitting on the can, because that's usually where I read comments.
[7007.02 → 7009.22] They all sound a little processed, though.
[7009.42 → 7010.24] They do a little bit.
[7010.32 → 7014.06] I think it's, like, potentially, like, not very great recordings, but that one's real.
[7014.46 → 7014.80] Okay.
[7015.12 → 7016.40] That one had some echo in it.
[7016.46 → 7017.30] And yes, you're right.
[7017.32 → 7018.14] It is real.
[7018.36 → 7019.32] Finally, sorry.
[7021.26 → 7023.48] Sorry for being late on the wand show this week, guys.
[7023.64 → 7024.66] Okay, well, that's fake.
[7024.72 → 7026.20] I would never call it the wand show.
[7026.20 → 7030.60] And I don't think you'd really apologize for being late, either.
[7030.70 → 7031.82] Luke, I need Luke's answer.
[7031.94 → 7032.20] It's fake.
[7032.34 → 7033.10] Yes, it's fake.
[7033.24 → 7033.76] Good job.
[7033.84 → 7034.42] Ten for ten.
[7034.50 → 7036.06] Everybody except Linus on the first one.
[7036.16 → 7037.34] Okay, so here's the thing, though.
[7038.86 → 7046.72] Not that long ago, when we did that video where James hosted it, and it was a deep fake, right?
[7046.72 → 7055.48] I don't know that the voice model that we had that time was really much better than some of these.
[7056.58 → 7057.84] And here's the thing.
[7058.34 → 7063.10] That was only able to be created with my explicit consent.
[7063.42 → 7065.06] There was, like, a whole process.
[7065.28 → 7070.52] They took an enormous data set, and, like, it took a long time to crunch it.
[7070.52 → 7074.94] But now this is being done with, what, 30 seconds of audio?
[7076.32 → 7077.46] That's wild.
[7077.68 → 7085.20] And I don't like that, like, you know, if this clip, like the original source that got us to kind of do this, right?
[7085.24 → 7085.44] Yeah.
[7085.60 → 7086.30] That Reddit thread.
[7086.30 → 7101.36] If one of those clips was put next to, like, a title that claimed that you were saying those things and didn't say that it was AI, you might trick some people.
[7101.76 → 7102.06] Yeah.
[7102.14 → 7104.02] You might trick some people that are less familiar with the voice.
[7104.22 → 7107.00] Like, yeah, I'm assuming, I wasn't looking at chat, obviously.
[7107.22 → 7111.38] I'm assuming float plane chat probably answered pretty accurately while we were going.
[7111.54 → 7111.78] Probably.
[7112.74 → 7115.48] But that's also float plane subscribers, right?
[7115.48 → 7116.96] Those people that are watching the show live.
[7117.34 → 7120.18] Yeah, guys, it's not scary where they are right now.
[7120.34 → 7122.62] It's scary how fast they're improving.
[7122.86 → 7123.12] Oh, yeah.
[7123.20 → 7130.70] And how easy it is for you to just generate a voice model of someone without their consent.
[7131.60 → 7134.84] So, I don't know.
[7135.02 → 7142.36] There's been a lot of discussion lately about using AI to make people say or do things without their consent.
[7142.72 → 7142.90] Yeah.
[7142.90 → 7166.24] And I think it's pretty safe to say at this point that, you know, while obviously that Reddit thread was clearly labelled and created in jest, in general, I think we all need to kind of figure out where the lines are here real fast and what's cool and what's a joke and what's really super not and what's harmful.
[7166.24 → 7170.06] And I think we are overall not doing a great job of it right now.
[7170.36 → 7170.58] Yes.
[7170.90 → 7172.84] There's significantly too much of this stuff.
[7172.94 → 7174.20] All I have to say about that.
[7174.38 → 7174.50] Yeah.
[7174.50 → 7182.36] Let's do a couple merch messages and then there are a couple other ones here that I want to get to.
[7182.44 → 7182.94] Oh, no.
[7183.06 → 7191.04] Let's talk about Twitter cracking down on just being smart, I guess.
[7191.04 → 7203.60] On Wednesday, Twitter announced that they will be charging for API access as of next week, eliminating the current free tier of API access that allows for up to 250 requests per month.
[7203.60 → 7211.80] One reason appears to be to eliminate bad bots, but popular entertainment and news aggregator bots will be similarly affected.
[7212.30 → 7225.34] So free services like at NinStatusBot, which tracks Nintendo server outages, and at Earthquake Bot, which tracks global earthquakes over 5.0 on the Richter scale, probably can't afford to pay $149 a month to continue operation.
[7225.34 → 7232.36] The fees for API access are ridiculous, like actually outlandish.
[7233.80 → 7241.52] Another reason appears to be to force researchers to pay to access what the announcement called one of the world's most powerful data sets.
[7241.88 → 7246.90] It's also one of the world's muddiest, most garbage-ridden data sets.
[7247.90 → 7250.40] It's definitely one of those.
[7250.72 → 7250.82] Yeah.
[7251.00 → 7254.32] That's a whole can of worms, I guess.
[7254.32 → 7265.90] I mean, if you're going to try to back out of the purchase based on how junk the data set is and full of bots it is, and then you're going to turn around and call it one of the world's most powerful data sets.
[7266.86 → 7282.96] I mean, I guess the contradiction doesn't matter to some people, but today, Elon Musk, CEO of Twitter, yeah, tweeted from his personal account that Twitter will begin sharing profits with creators for the ads that appear below their tweets.
[7282.96 → 7285.70] I should ask about the ads that appear right before their tweets.
[7286.86 → 7299.14] For those of you who are just tuning in now, we're referring to a controversy where YouTube is not paying shorts creators for ads that show up before the user has watched a short, but while they are in the shorts feed.
[7299.14 → 7305.84] So long as they have a paid subscription to Twitter Blue.
[7306.78 → 7308.14] So you actually have to pay.
[7308.90 → 7309.90] You have to pay to make money.
[7310.04 → 7311.16] You don't know how much money you're going to make.
[7311.22 → 7313.38] Eligible for ad sharing.
[7315.58 → 7315.92] Okay.
[7316.36 → 7316.72] No.
[7317.64 → 7318.54] So there's that.
[7319.44 → 7320.30] So that's cool.
[7320.30 → 7329.94] In response to a comment, Musk likewise announced that Twitter's legacy blue verified checks will sunset in a few months.
[7331.22 → 7335.02] Yeah, that went really well last time.
[7335.78 → 7337.28] That was perfect.
[7337.54 → 7341.04] There were no problems with impersonation last time.
[7341.88 → 7342.14] Yeah.
[7342.54 → 7343.02] Cool.
[7343.26 → 7345.82] So I don't know if he realizes this yet.
[7346.02 → 7347.50] Maybe he made a video.
[7347.50 → 7349.80] I haven't watched it, but I have read some of the comments.
[7350.90 → 7358.64] I don't know if he realizes this yet, but the problem last time was making check marks available to anyone who would pay.
[7359.02 → 7360.50] And so there was a ton of impersonation.
[7360.86 → 7369.52] And the problem this time will be a bunch of legitimate accounts not being verified, which opens the doors wide open to impersonation.
[7369.70 → 7369.84] Right?
[7369.98 → 7372.18] Like, you get it, right?
[7372.46 → 7374.02] These are the same thing.
[7374.28 → 7375.32] Just two different ways.
[7375.32 → 7381.08] We had a problem before Musk bought Twitter where a ton of legitimate accounts that needed verification couldn't get it.
[7381.52 → 7385.72] And now we're going to have a problem where no accounts have verification.
[7387.26 → 7387.66] Nice.
[7388.26 → 7388.68] Cool.
[7389.92 → 7398.34] The overwhelming majority of current legacy blue verified accounts are celebrities, journalists, government officials, and departments and brands.
[7399.36 → 7399.80] So...
[7399.80 → 7401.10] People that could use verification.
[7401.24 → 7402.32] Yeah, this is a problem.
[7402.38 → 7404.14] Well, then I guess they can afford to pay for it, Luke.
[7404.14 → 7405.16] Like, probably...
[7405.16 → 7405.86] Not always, but probably true.
[7405.86 → 7406.34] But it's the...
[7406.34 → 7406.84] It's the...
[7406.84 → 7408.54] It's the town square!
[7410.22 → 7412.02] Everyone should have an equal voice!
[7412.12 → 7413.34] Just some more equal than others!
[7413.34 → 7415.20] Why do we still talk about Twitter news, man?
[7416.02 → 7416.64] I don't know.
[7416.72 → 7416.96] It's...
[7416.96 → 7417.66] It's like...
[7417.66 → 7418.60] How can you look away?
[7418.72 → 7419.46] It's just...
[7419.46 → 7420.22] You got it!
[7420.42 → 7421.34] It's a dumpster fire!
[7421.56 → 7422.54] There's so many people that are like...
[7422.54 → 7423.14] It's so hot!
[7423.14 → 7424.78] Musk is the bad man!
[7424.78 → 7427.24] And then promote him as much as they possibly can.
[7427.32 → 7428.20] I feel like we're doing the same thing.
[7428.20 → 7429.30] I don't even know about bad.
[7429.42 → 7430.80] I think it's just like...
[7430.80 → 7432.06] Musk is the entertaining thing.
[7434.86 → 7435.58] Look, Mom!
[7435.70 → 7436.14] Clown!
[7436.14 → 7439.42] All right.
[7439.50 → 7439.92] Fair enough.
[7440.46 → 7441.06] Like, it's...
[7441.06 → 7443.50] It is honestly comical.
[7443.88 → 7446.02] It raises so many questions for me.
[7446.46 → 7449.16] How can someone who has managed to...
[7449.16 → 7451.16] Whether it's deserved or not...
[7451.16 → 7456.72] Managed to get so much of the credit for the accomplishments of the companies that he has led?
[7456.82 → 7457.34] I guess?
[7457.42 → 7458.26] Up until now.
[7458.26 → 7458.52] Okay.
[7458.66 → 7460.78] Make such terrible short-sighted decisions.
[7461.00 → 7462.50] To put on my wheel of...
[7462.50 → 7462.68] Sure.
[7462.68 → 7463.30] Whatever it's called.
[7463.48 → 7463.70] Hat.
[7465.84 → 7466.44] Go ahead.
[7466.52 → 7467.42] Defend the indefensible.
[7467.54 → 7473.72] He should be able to make changes to the thing that he bought that was categorically a failure.
[7473.96 → 7474.20] Sure.
[7474.34 → 7475.28] In like every measure of the way.
[7475.28 → 7475.54] Oh, yeah.
[7475.54 → 7476.22] I was losing money.
[7476.36 → 7477.96] I think they make money like...
[7477.96 → 7478.46] It was hemorrhaging insane amounts of money.
[7478.46 → 7480.40] I think they make money like one quarter ever or something like that.
[7480.46 → 7481.70] I don't even know if they did that.
[7481.76 → 7482.22] Maybe they did.
[7482.26 → 7482.54] I don't know.
[7482.60 → 7483.86] I genuinely don't know if that's true or not.
[7483.86 → 7487.18] What I do know is they were losing insane amounts of money.
[7487.18 → 7488.72] Just year over year.
[7489.08 → 7490.80] Just bleeding out like crazy.
[7490.98 → 7494.22] So he has to find some way to try to make it make money.
[7494.38 → 7496.04] And that's going to be really hard for Twitter.
[7496.48 → 7502.98] I'm pretty sure I've said on the WAN show a bunch of times in the past that I don't really understand how Twitter would make a lot of money.
[7503.58 → 7505.52] He scared all the advertisers away.
[7506.34 → 7507.92] Yeah, that wasn't a good plan.
[7508.02 → 7510.42] So now he's got to find a different solution.
[7510.82 → 7513.72] And maybe those bot guys will pay for it or something.
[7513.78 → 7514.16] I don't know.
[7515.02 → 7516.60] I think this is a bad move.
[7516.60 → 7529.00] I do think that the statement, just like a lot of things that have happened with Twitter, I think the original statement is correct to a lot of degrees.
[7529.16 → 7533.66] Like there probably is a lot of bots that are using the API that are bad.
[7534.22 → 7534.42] For sure.
[7534.76 → 7535.50] Probably true.
[7535.76 → 7536.50] Probably true.
[7536.68 → 7539.78] I don't think you necessarily fix it this way.
[7539.88 → 7541.64] No, I don't think this is the solution at all.
[7541.64 → 7542.08] Yeah.
[7542.30 → 7548.48] The solution to a bunch of the definitely real problems that have been pushed out are questionable.
[7548.98 → 7551.52] And some of them have been pushed out and then pulled back.
[7551.58 → 7553.62] And like they've been acting very quickly.
[7553.90 → 7558.62] They've been quite agile in their way of doing things, which some people will say is good, and some people will say is bad.
[7558.62 → 7566.20] And I just, my stance has been the same this whole time, which is, it was a dumpster fire before.
[7566.32 → 7569.46] Like we can't forget how trash it was.
[7571.32 → 7572.82] Which I think a lot of people do.
[7573.02 → 7575.24] I think they look back at old Twitter with rose-tinted glasses.
[7575.26 → 7575.78] Yeah, it was crap.
[7576.04 → 7576.72] It was crap.
[7576.94 → 7577.54] It was crap then.
[7577.64 → 7578.28] It's crap now.
[7578.40 → 7580.12] Crap in like seven different ways.
[7580.32 → 7581.90] Yeah, it's burning crap.
[7582.30 → 7582.84] Yeah, sure.
[7583.08 → 7583.70] There we go.
[7583.96 → 7584.56] That's pretty good.
[7584.56 → 7586.28] Yes, they have had a profitable year.
[7586.56 → 7588.50] In 2019, Twitter was profitable.
[7588.78 → 7589.04] Cool.
[7589.44 → 7590.84] That was a while ago.
[7592.00 → 7592.88] It's been a minute.
[7593.20 → 7593.36] Yeah.
[7594.24 → 7594.72] Yeah.
[7594.78 → 7595.88] So I don't know.
[7596.22 → 7604.84] It's, I think the answer to, I think it would have been kind of neat if you could like to apply to be like a bot of good faith.
[7604.84 → 7618.36] Because there are honestly straight up, and I actually find it really annoying if I am actually using Twitter and I see this happen, where you get like every single reply to a tweet is like at save thread or whatever.
[7619.20 → 7625.52] They just like, it's just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tweets just calling bots in to like save threads or save videos or do whatever else.
[7625.64 → 7627.20] Oh, I haven't really seen that.
[7627.42 → 7630.08] Build this functionality or like something.
[7630.08 → 7633.66] So there's functionality solving bots.
[7634.10 → 7634.38] Right.
[7634.48 → 7636.62] That they're very likely going to block out.
[7636.82 → 7637.10] Right.
[7637.20 → 7637.88] Yeah, for sure.
[7638.34 → 7638.46] Yeah.
[7638.48 → 7640.36] Jayden's saying, why not bot verified?
[7640.52 → 7640.98] Yeah, exactly.
[7641.10 → 7649.48] So like, I feel like the old verification system where you like to apply for it, and then you get it or not, might actually make sense for bots.
[7649.58 → 7650.74] But then they didn't do that.
[7650.88 → 7651.00] They just.
[7651.06 → 7655.04] Yeah, you'd have to have people who work on something that doesn't generate revenue.
[7655.36 → 7655.62] Yeah.
[7655.62 → 7655.66] Yeah.
[7656.06 → 7658.68] Which is clearly not the plan.
[7658.68 → 7659.10] Not happening.
[7659.26 → 7660.18] At Twitter 2.0.
[7660.28 → 7660.64] Again.
[7660.84 → 7661.40] Which is hardcore.
[7662.78 → 7669.06] Might make sense to certain degrees because they're sitting on this teetering edge going like, are we going to completely bankrupt ourselves?
[7669.64 → 7669.80] Yeah.
[7669.80 → 7679.18] So like, would you as a leader of a ship that is potentially a month or two away from bankruptcy want to commit anything to something that isn't going to make money?
[7680.04 → 7680.84] Pretty unlikely.
[7681.16 → 7681.62] I don't know.
[7683.22 → 7684.10] Situations whack.
[7684.10 → 7691.68] Speaking of whack, Netflix will probably, maybe, definitely, possibly kick you off of your mom's account.
[7692.32 → 7695.54] Netflix has posted a set of new user guidelines.
[7696.10 → 7706.60] Netflix claims the post was an accident, and the guidelines were intended only for a few countries in Latin America where it has been testing paid account sharing since last year.
[7706.60 → 7713.62] But, I mean, by accident usually just means by accident early.
[7714.00 → 7717.98] You don't accidentally publish a page outlining new policy.
[7718.28 → 7721.24] Or like, you don't actually accidentally create it in the first place.
[7721.24 → 7727.08] And if it was for countries in Latin America, like, does it make sense that it was in English?
[7727.66 → 7729.62] Am I overlooking something here?
[7729.62 → 7731.80] It feels very, like, Wizards of the Coast-y.
[7732.32 → 7732.66] Yeah.
[7732.76 → 7736.42] Where they had that whole thing for Dungeons & Dragons, and they're like, oh, I mean, it's not out yet.
[7736.48 → 7737.34] It's like, yeah, come on.
[7737.34 → 7746.94] Especially because the plan to crack down on password sharing is corroborated by a letter to Netflix shareholders stating that paid sharing would be rolled out more broadly in March.
[7746.94 → 7760.98] The guidelines state that all devices will be required to log into their home Wi-Fi network at least once every 31 days to ensure that the account is not being shared outside the household.
[7761.16 → 7763.92] Which raises all kinds of questions.
[7764.36 → 7767.26] Why are they tracking which Wi-Fi networks you're logging into?
[7767.52 → 7768.16] Is that your question?
[7768.16 → 7768.94] No, not even that.
[7769.18 → 7777.86] So my question, Mr. Teacher, is what about a lot of places in the world where they don't have Wi-Fi, and they run off cellular signals at home?
[7778.14 → 7779.08] Well, that would still...
[7779.08 → 7779.98] Oh, I see.
[7780.72 → 7781.00] Yeah.
[7781.56 → 7781.82] Yeah.
[7781.82 → 7782.50] Yeah, what about that?
[7782.62 → 7784.26] That's, like, not uncommon.
[7784.48 → 7785.44] Yeah, I forgot about that.
[7785.44 → 7786.24] It's uncommon where we're from.
[7786.46 → 7788.36] Yeah, but in, like, Taiwan and stuff.
[7788.42 → 7789.14] Super common.
[7789.26 → 7789.54] Yeah.
[7789.84 → 7790.10] Yeah.
[7790.18 → 7790.46] Yeah.
[7790.46 → 7791.72] This is totally a thing.
[7791.96 → 7796.42] There are places around the world that have perfect cellular infrastructure.
[7796.66 → 7796.82] And cheap.
[7797.00 → 7797.84] Cheap data.
[7798.16 → 7801.06] To the point where, like, why would you even get home internet?
[7801.98 → 7804.90] You have basically unlimited data, and it's really cheap.
[7805.04 → 7805.50] Oh, balls.
[7805.62 → 7805.88] All right.
[7806.06 → 7806.44] Well, anyway.
[7806.58 → 7808.42] It's like, how the heck is that supposed to work?
[7809.26 → 7816.74] While travelling, users may request a temporary code that will give them access to the account for seven consecutive days.
[7816.74 → 7822.50] But otherwise, logging into the account away from home may result in it being locked.
[7823.62 → 7827.84] Netflix estimates that at least 100 million households engage in password sharing.
[7828.28 → 7831.68] Based on the Latin American trials, they expect to see a wave of cancellations.
[7832.18 → 7835.66] Apparently, they're going to use location ID for mobile.
[7836.10 → 7836.46] Okay.
[7836.70 → 7838.22] Or location services for mobile, sorry.
[7838.22 → 7846.90] Followed by a rise in revenue as account borrowers open their accounts and users expand to paid tiers with more flexible sharing options.
[7846.90 → 7848.64] I don't know, man.
[7848.64 → 7850.44] I don't know, man.
[7850.44 → 7863.34] I feel like, I don't know how much Netflix costs in Latin America, but I feel like at the rates Netflix is trying to charge in the U.S. and Canada, they may not see the same result.
[7863.46 → 7865.26] Apparently, they may have retracted this.
[7865.26 → 7869.80] People are sharing links to us right now.
[7870.18 → 7873.04] Netflix has retracted password sharing restrictions.
[7873.04 → 7874.64] Well, yeah, but we're not saying they didn't.
[7874.90 → 7876.46] We said that right away.
[7876.82 → 7878.46] Netflix claims the post was an accident.
[7878.62 → 7879.58] Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[7879.58 → 7887.68] We're just telling you guys that there was the letter to shareholders saying that paid sharing would be rolled out more broadly come March.
[7887.80 → 7891.56] They've been threatening cracking down on password sharing for a super long time.
[7891.62 → 7893.62] Just because this leaked early doesn't mean they're not doing it.
[7893.74 → 7893.96] Yeah.
[7894.44 → 7895.70] So, yeah.
[7896.56 → 7897.00] Yeah.
[7897.00 → 7900.64] I don't know.
[7900.78 → 7901.54] I don't know what to tell you.
[7901.60 → 7906.60] This is one of those things where the I mean, it's not like the license agreement has changed.
[7906.90 → 7910.14] It was never intended to be shared outside a household.
[7910.64 → 7918.92] It was intended to be like, the way I understood it is it was kind of like cable subscriptions, like at your house, like just like when they were mailing DVDs.
[7918.92 → 7919.28] Yeah.
[7919.46 → 7925.46] It's not intended for you to take the DVD with you on vacation for a month.
[7925.46 → 7927.94] Actually, I think you could keep things as long as you wanted.
[7928.04 → 7929.92] You just had to send them back when you got the new ones?
[7930.04 → 7930.24] Get a new one.
[7930.54 → 7930.84] Okay.
[7930.96 → 7931.90] So then fine.
[7932.18 → 7934.04] That is not a great comparison.
[7934.44 → 7939.48] But my understanding of it was that it was kind of like your cable TV, like it's like at your address.
[7939.60 → 7944.56] And obviously you can invite friends over to watch it with you or whatever, and you can all use it there at your address.
[7944.56 → 7947.00] But it was like per family was my understanding.
[7947.00 → 7955.74] And so this is basically them just enforcing something that was always the rules.
[7956.06 → 7959.34] But the problem with it is almost that they let it go for so long.
[7959.48 → 7960.82] That it's become normalcy.
[7961.14 → 7961.42] Yeah.
[7961.42 → 7961.86] It's expected.
[7961.86 → 7968.66] So now that they haven't been fighting this battle for so long, like as long as...
[7968.66 → 7969.78] Well, they promoted it too.
[7969.90 → 7971.44] Like I know people have meted on this a lot.
[7971.52 → 7972.80] I'm not the first person to point this out.
[7972.84 → 7976.46] But there's a tweet from forever ago from Netflix that says,
[7976.58 → 7977.82] Love is sharing a password.
[7980.06 → 7984.92] Like they have engaged and promoted with this type of activity.
[7985.10 → 7986.60] That muddies the waters a lot.
[7986.62 → 7986.90] Oh, yeah.
[7987.00 → 7987.66] It sure does.
[7987.68 → 7988.12] A lot.
[7988.84 → 7990.26] Like it's weird.
[7990.60 → 7991.06] I don't know.
[7991.30 → 7995.96] Like I can totally understand the idea of like, wow, there's a lot of people freeloading off this service.
[7996.50 → 7999.74] At least we make it so that only a certain amount of screens can be active at a time.
[8000.20 → 8003.46] That limits the amount of freeloading on the service, Ada, Ada, Ada.
[8005.06 → 8006.88] It might even be a promotion vehicle.
[8007.14 → 8008.70] I've wondered about that in the past.
[8008.70 → 8015.56] Like if you're leeching off of someone's Netflix, but they keep kicking you off whenever they want to watch it,
[8015.56 → 8018.52] you might be like, well, okay, I should just get my own account.
[8018.52 → 8019.88] I guess I'll just get my own account at some point.
[8019.96 → 8020.48] Yeah, for sure.
[8020.54 → 8022.38] But now you're just going to pirate.
[8022.92 → 8023.32] Yeah.
[8023.52 → 8024.32] Or privateer.
[8024.48 → 8029.46] We are headed into, I think, the next big piracy age.
[8030.46 → 8030.88] Oh, yeah.
[8030.88 → 8038.20] I mean, people demonstrated that no, they were not willing to pay for packages full of content that they don't care about.
[8038.70 → 8046.28] They showed that they were really only interested in à la carte and a reasonable monthly subscription.
[8046.64 → 8053.42] And now we have subscriptions up the butt just being thrown at us from every direction.
[8053.80 → 8058.94] I mean, okay, you recently got a mattress with a subscription.
[8058.94 → 8061.00] Yeah, not a mattress, but yeah.
[8061.24 → 8062.56] Well, basically, I don't know.
[8062.68 → 8063.72] How would you describe it?
[8063.74 → 8064.76] It's like a cover thing.
[8064.92 → 8065.20] Right.
[8065.46 → 8065.94] So like.
[8067.26 → 8067.96] It's stupid.
[8068.70 → 8069.06] What?
[8069.20 → 8069.78] I hate it.
[8070.42 → 8071.30] Not the thing.
[8071.36 → 8072.04] Are you paying it?
[8072.94 → 8073.64] I think.
[8074.12 → 8075.40] I think it comes with a free trial.
[8075.96 → 8076.72] Yeah, that thing.
[8077.20 → 8077.80] I think that thing.
[8077.88 → 8078.82] Are you going to pay for it?
[8078.86 → 8079.50] I don't think so.
[8080.50 → 8082.18] It might be good for some people.
[8082.96 → 8086.62] My problem is I just put it on the lowest possible temperature.
[8087.32 → 8088.00] That's great.
[8088.00 → 8088.44] Okay.
[8088.90 → 8090.52] He's got one of those cooled.
[8090.64 → 8091.58] I have a cooling thing.
[8091.78 → 8092.18] Mattresses.
[8092.30 → 8093.46] I am a warm boy.
[8094.20 → 8094.96] He is a warm boy.
[8095.04 → 8098.24] And my partner is a cold lady.
[8099.68 → 8100.08] Frigid.
[8100.30 → 8101.48] We'll be in the.
[8101.64 → 8101.72] So.
[8101.86 → 8103.42] I mean, I was all like, hey.
[8103.58 → 8104.12] And she was like.
[8104.82 → 8104.94] What?
[8106.84 → 8112.72] I will be there with like a sheet just over my midsection, just sweating buckets.
[8113.06 → 8113.26] Yeah.
[8113.26 → 8114.64] She's in the same room with me.
[8114.90 → 8116.56] Three blankets on shivering.
[8117.08 → 8119.62] And like, I'm not exaggerating.
[8119.76 → 8120.92] This has actually happened.
[8121.04 → 8121.16] Yeah.
[8121.48 → 8123.06] So we needed something.
[8123.06 → 8126.00] And it was like way too much money.
[8126.20 → 8126.74] But I was.
[8127.06 → 8130.10] I've been having an extremely hard time sleeping for a long time because of that.
[8130.16 → 8131.64] Because I literally just sweat constantly.
[8131.92 → 8132.04] Yeah.
[8132.88 → 8134.34] And to be able to sleep properly.
[8134.50 → 8136.70] Your temperature is supposed to drop a little bit.
[8136.76 → 8138.98] And that just was never happening for me and all this kind of stuff.
[8139.10 → 8139.30] Yeah.
[8139.30 → 8142.18] So, yeah, I got one.
[8143.10 → 8145.64] And I put it on the minimum possible temperature.
[8146.58 → 8151.08] And it doesn't solve the problem completely because I'm still a really warm boy.
[8151.16 → 8151.38] Yeah.
[8151.52 → 8153.56] But it helps noticeably.
[8154.50 → 8157.82] It is like, it actually helps quite noticeably.
[8158.16 → 8162.64] So worth it, I guess, even though it was a lot, and I am a cheap person.
[8163.86 → 8167.14] Raging Ozark asks, why are so many women cold all the time?
[8167.14 → 8170.58] It's because physiologically they are different, and they're colder.
[8171.30 → 8172.66] I was reading an interesting.
[8172.66 → 8174.02] Fat stores and all this other kind of stuff.
[8174.16 → 8174.30] Yeah.
[8174.32 → 8181.80] I was reading an interesting article about the perceived warmth for men and women in general.
[8182.42 → 8187.66] And it was something like our room temperatures are like multiple degrees.
[8187.66 → 8188.64] It's like three or four degrees.
[8188.64 → 8189.00] Different.
[8189.40 → 8191.52] Like it's enormous.
[8191.86 → 8192.02] Yeah.
[8192.10 → 8193.84] It's not a small amount.
[8193.84 → 8210.28] And in a generally male run world, the temperatures that we generally accept as comfortable and within reason are not actually comfortable for women.
[8210.50 → 8212.30] I didn't know this for a super long time.
[8212.30 → 8212.72] Me neither.
[8212.94 → 8213.14] Yeah.
[8213.14 → 8213.50] Yeah.
[8213.58 → 8215.84] I only came across this like a few months ago.
[8216.48 → 8226.84] And in general, I kind of still stand behind that you can put on a sweater, but I cannot strip down to nothing.
[8227.12 → 8227.52] Why not?
[8227.98 → 8231.56] Because sometimes even like, okay, for me and Yvonne, it's the same thing.
[8231.92 → 8233.64] She's a she's a chilly lady.
[8233.64 → 8239.26] Um, and I'm not like you quite, but I'm a pretty warm running boy as well.
[8239.60 → 8249.60] And so I could be completely naked, and she could be wearing a sweater and both of us would be at a, at a similar level of comfortable, but like opposite ends.
[8249.72 → 8250.38] Yeah, exactly.
[8250.38 → 8263.20] And so it's, it's one of those things where it's like, it's a lot easier for you to put on a sweater and be comfortable than for me to be sweating buckets and be uncomfortable for different reasons.
[8263.20 → 8266.38] And my, my, my, my girlfriend was a trooper, man.
[8266.46 → 8277.78] Like she tried, she would, she would go to sleep wearing like sweats and have two blankets and like all this other kind of stuff because she was trying to make it so that I wasn't suffering, but I was still suffering.
[8277.78 → 8283.42] And I felt bad because she's doing that and just, just, so.
[8283.74 → 8286.90] The only time I get really upset though is when.
[8286.90 → 8288.58] This isn't an ad by the way, I just like bought it.
[8288.90 → 8295.60] It is, is when a lady in your life complains about the smell when they won't turn down the heat.
[8296.46 → 8305.94] So that cross-country trip I did with my mom, the amount of complaining there was about how much I stank was like, mother.
[8306.12 → 8307.10] What am I supposed to do about it?
[8307.10 → 8308.60] What on earth am I supposed to do?
[8308.62 → 8309.64] I am literally sweating a bucket.
[8309.76 → 8314.70] I am, I, I, I am literally sweating through my clothes, and you won't turn off the heater.
[8314.94 → 8315.88] For, for people that think.
[8315.88 → 8319.12] And every time I try to crack the window, you tell me to close it.
[8319.12 → 8325.38] And I'm like, well, it's nothing I can do about that.
[8325.68 → 8329.34] For, for people that think I'm exaggerating, I was losing four pounds of sweat a night.
[8330.24 → 8331.12] That's wild.
[8331.32 → 8332.54] That sounds impossible.
[8332.82 → 8333.00] Yeah.
[8333.00 → 8335.98] I, I'm, I'm sure there might be some issues with my measurement.
[8335.98 → 8340.88] The way that I would do it, um, is I would weigh myself immediately before bed.
[8340.88 → 8345.02] And then before going to the washroom, I'd weigh myself immediately in the morning.
[8345.02 → 8347.80] I'm sure there are some issues there, some other things going on.
[8347.80 → 8354.60] Um, but it was, I was dropping four pounds every night consistently every time.
[8354.82 → 8358.34] So I was like, something has to change something.
[8358.82 → 8362.66] I'm like begging for more fans or the AC to be on or something.
[8362.66 → 8367.60] But then I also know that my girlfriend is like suffering because she's freezing.
[8367.78 → 8369.62] And I'm like, that's also not okay.
[8369.62 → 8371.56] So like, yeah, I don't know.
[8372.12 → 8376.22] People, uh, people are asking when is whole human water cooling coming?
[8376.32 → 8377.32] We already did that video.
[8377.54 → 8379.18] The water cooled gaming chair.
[8379.50 → 8380.60] It's awesome.
[8380.84 → 8383.88] It's basically the same concept as a cooled mattress.
[8385.34 → 8387.26] You would breathe out one pound.
[8387.76 → 8387.96] Yeah.
[8388.02 → 8388.94] See, like, I don't know.
[8389.06 → 8391.52] There's, there are things going on that I don't understand.
[8391.68 → 8393.48] Just that's why I explained the method.
[8393.48 → 8397.00] So my incorrectness could be figured out.
[8397.00 → 8398.60] I mean, I don't even know what a pound is.
[8398.60 → 8400.92] How does that relate to a kilogram?
[8401.90 → 8403.08] I'm kidding.
[8403.24 → 8403.50] I'm kidding.
[8403.58 → 8407.68] Being Canadian, we have to be well-versed in both metric and imperial measures.
[8407.96 → 8411.66] So it's 2.2 pounds to a kilo, which I have to know.
[8412.38 → 8412.52] Yeah.
[8412.92 → 8413.14] Yeah.
[8413.92 → 8415.94] Oh, oh, oh, crap.
[8416.74 → 8419.60] LTX 2023 ticket site walkthrough.
[8419.74 → 8420.68] We need to do this.
[8421.46 → 8424.04] Um, I have to log into the store.
[8424.26 → 8424.38] Yeah.
[8424.38 → 8425.94] Don't do that while sharing your screen.
[8425.94 → 8427.06] Uh, okay.
[8427.78 → 8428.58] Uh, boom.
[8428.60 → 8429.24] Uh, okay.
[8429.26 → 8429.72] What do I do?
[8430.62 → 8432.86] Uh, just do it before sharing your screen.
[8432.96 → 8433.18] Well.
[8433.18 → 8434.04] And then show the site.
[8434.12 → 8434.76] Thanks, smart guy.
[8434.88 → 8435.36] You got it.
[8435.52 → 8436.34] Why are you going to be like that?
[8436.46 → 8436.88] I believe in you.
[8436.98 → 8438.68] You asked what you have to do.
[8439.76 → 8441.80] Why, why are you, why are you like this?
[8443.48 → 8444.28] Uh, okay.
[8444.30 → 8446.58] Do you want to do a thing real quick while I do this?
[8446.58 → 8447.76] Um, sure.
[8447.76 → 8448.90] Um, sure.
[8449.12 → 8451.74] I don't think it's going to take you very long, but.
[8451.74 → 8452.60] It could.
[8452.60 → 8459.30] I mean, I managed to completely screw up everything last week.
[8459.52 → 8461.36] I can be pretty dumb sometimes.
[8462.16 → 8462.60] Um.
[8463.46 → 8465.34] You underestimate my abilities.
[8466.38 → 8466.74] Okay.
[8466.96 → 8467.46] No, I'm ready.
[8467.62 → 8472.66] Dennis requests that you talk about the video premiering tomorrow where he replaces Linus'
[8472.82 → 8473.24] assistant.
[8474.24 → 8475.00] Source, Dennis.
[8475.00 → 8475.48] Source.
[8475.48 → 8475.92] So.
[8476.26 → 8477.66] It's already on Flow plane, by the way.
[8477.68 → 8483.90] One thing I'd like to clarify is that we, uh, we have a shared executive assistant, but
[8483.90 → 8487.12] yes, they're, they're mostly to help me.
[8487.68 → 8495.84] Um, I still like kind of have no idea how to effectively use an assistant.
[8496.00 → 8500.02] Linus giving the reins over on anything is like a very big challenge.
[8500.12 → 8500.84] Why are you going to be like that?
[8502.04 → 8502.24] Um.
[8502.24 → 8503.32] Why, why are you going to be like that?
[8503.34 → 8504.00] Just being honest, man.
[8504.00 → 8505.80] Well, it's just, it's one of those things where like, okay.
[8505.80 → 8506.42] I don't blame you.
[8506.48 → 8507.66] I'm just, it's just a thing.
[8507.76 → 8509.22] We're in the middle of a shoot, right?
[8509.52 → 8511.68] Let's say we're in the middle of a shoot, and we need a cable.
[8513.26 → 8513.88] So what?
[8513.98 → 8515.36] I should get my assistant to go get it?
[8516.20 → 8517.00] Why don't I just go get it?
[8517.02 → 8518.56] It's not like I can shoot until I have the cable.
[8519.12 → 8520.02] What difference does it make?
[8520.50 → 8522.04] Is there anything else you do in the meantime?
[8523.34 → 8523.80] I don't know.
[8523.82 → 8524.46] Could you answer an email?
[8524.94 → 8525.22] Maybe.
[8525.76 → 8526.04] Probably.
[8526.48 → 8527.28] Unless I don't.
[8527.56 → 8529.86] Unless I just don't want to anyway, and I could use the break.
[8530.54 → 8531.16] Like I don't.
[8531.16 → 8532.96] Well, if you could use the break, then that has value too.
[8532.96 → 8533.96] I don't know, man.
[8534.00 → 8535.00] It's tough.
[8535.26 → 8535.72] It's tough.
[8535.82 → 8541.68] Anyway, the point is that here, I'll just bring it up on float plane here.
[8542.18 → 8549.30] Oh, hey, there's an exclusive of Dennis's makeover here transforming into Vance.
[8549.56 → 8550.96] So here's the video.
[8551.56 → 8556.38] Dennis replaced our executive assistant for a day.
[8557.38 → 8560.98] And I'm not going to spoil anything, but that happened.
[8567.70 → 8568.10] Yep.
[8568.56 → 8568.92] Charming.
[8568.92 → 8571.02] So you guys can check that out on float plane.
[8571.14 → 8576.04] Obviously, we've got lots of other behind the scenes and exclusives and stuff like that.
[8576.06 → 8577.82] Anything with the little gold float plane here.
[8578.22 → 8581.72] Here's how Tynan saw to monitor in half for the intro of a video.
[8582.40 → 8583.80] That's been really well received.
[8584.12 → 8588.34] Here's a what's in your PC going around and asking everyone in the office what they're running.
[8588.74 → 8591.16] We're trying to do lots of really cool exclusive content.
[8591.38 → 8592.62] This is worth watching.
[8593.22 → 8594.88] Meet the team with Kyle.
[8595.02 → 8598.76] He kind of talks through a lot of the development that we've gone through for the screwdriver and stuff like that.
[8598.82 → 8599.78] It's about half an hour long.
[8599.78 → 8602.44] If you're ever looking for extras, that's a good place to get them.
[8602.56 → 8606.52] And if you're ever looking for tickets for LTX, let's go.
[8606.78 → 8607.70] That transition.
[8608.00 → 8617.24] The purpose of showing this to you guys right now is so that when tickets go live at 9 a.m. on Monday.
[8618.06 → 8618.34] Okay.
[8618.66 → 8623.06] So that's in three days, 9 a.m. Pacific time.
[8623.06 → 8630.84] You won't have to kind of freak out and go like, oh, where do I get this, and where do I get that?
[8631.02 → 8634.38] And oh, I missed something that I wanted because I was in a hurry to check out.
[8634.74 → 8637.50] So I'm trying to show you guys what everything is going to look like.
[8638.12 → 8642.52] For tickets for LTX, you can get Saturday Expo, Sunday Expo.
[8642.62 → 8643.46] Those are one day.
[8643.82 → 8646.94] You can get two-day Expo tickets, so you can come both days.
[8647.62 → 8650.48] You can get BYOC plus two-day Expo.
[8650.48 → 8657.42] We have no way to attend the Whale Land BYOC gaming event without buying a two-day Expo pass.
[8657.50 → 8662.38] And the reason for that is that we have no way of keeping BYOC people separate.
[8662.94 → 8669.34] There's the Dolphin VIP package, which is essentially LTX Expo VIP.
[8670.14 → 8673.22] So two-day Dolphin badge that provides Expo access.
[8674.42 → 8675.84] Reserved main stage seating.
[8676.00 → 8678.42] You can skip some lines with an express line punch card.
[8678.42 → 8679.84] VIP meet and greet session.
[8680.48 → 8684.56] And you'll have a Dolphin VIP merch pack.
[8685.18 → 8686.30] Nope, nope, that's...
[8686.30 → 8686.72] Oh, yeah.
[8687.16 → 8687.76] Yes, right?
[8688.32 → 8688.62] Yes.
[8688.84 → 8689.92] Dolphin VIP merch pack.
[8690.04 → 8690.24] Yes.
[8690.78 → 8691.14] Okay.
[8691.22 → 8693.16] Then there's the Orca VIP package.
[8693.36 → 8697.58] This is essentially a Whale Land VIP spot.
[8697.58 → 8700.62] So you get two-day Orca badge.
[8700.62 → 8700.64] So you get two-day Orca badge.
[8701.72 → 8705.10] 48-inch by 30-inch VIP BYOC table section.
[8705.52 → 8707.06] Reserved front row main stage seating.
[8707.22 → 8709.38] Skip some lines with express line punch card.
[8709.80 → 8713.36] And you get a Whale Land merch pack.
[8713.54 → 8714.42] Ba-BA-da-ba-ba-ba-ba!
[8714.96 → 8716.12] There it is!
[8716.82 → 8717.26] Sweet!
[8717.48 → 8718.80] There's going to be some new desk pads.
[8719.04 → 8720.70] You will pick one of your choice.
[8720.70 → 8724.44] So we'll have to figure that out, I guess, when you're checking out.
[8724.86 → 8725.10] Okay.
[8725.22 → 8727.24] And then finally, there's the Whale VIP package.
[8727.34 → 8728.74] Yes, that is not a typo.
[8728.84 → 8731.08] It is $10,000 US dollars.
[8731.54 → 8732.96] You want to know what's even crazier?
[8733.80 → 8735.32] We already sold two.
[8735.32 → 8747.12] We told the Whale attendees at Whale Land one that we would give them first crack at Whale tickets for LTX.
[8747.18 → 8748.30] Does this one include a computer?
[8749.20 → 8749.50] Yep.
[8749.68 → 8750.66] They got a computer from the West.
[8750.66 → 8750.98] I know.
[8751.06 → 8751.64] Two of them.
[8751.80 → 8754.96] Two of them are back at the Whale tier.
[8755.72 → 8757.50] I mean, that's the whole point, right?
[8757.86 → 8758.16] Yeah.
[8758.16 → 8761.08] I mean, if you're going to Whale, you don't just Whale once.
[8763.48 → 8764.16] All right.
[8764.16 → 8766.92] A harpoon would be a good one.
[8769.10 → 8769.90] Oh, man.
[8770.50 → 8773.30] I mean, is it bad that we own this whole thing so hard?
[8773.56 → 8774.44] The Wholeness?
[8774.66 → 8775.44] I can't tell.
[8775.64 → 8776.04] I don't know.
[8776.04 → 8776.34] I'm not sure.
[8776.46 → 8778.70] Anyway, it includes a unique Whale badge.
[8780.38 → 8783.32] Take it all with the Whale seating section for the main stage.
[8783.42 → 8785.36] Skip some lines with Express Cut, blah, blah, etc.
[8785.76 → 8789.48] You get to hang out with the LTD staff during the Whale VIP meet and greet session.
[8790.02 → 8792.78] LTD office and labs tour plus transportation and lunch.
[8792.78 → 8796.02] A serious haul of merch with the Whale VIP merch pack.
[8796.50 → 8798.48] Luxury hotel room Friday to Sunday.
[8799.02 → 8799.70] Concierge service.
[8799.78 → 8800.40] That's spelled wrong.
[8800.50 → 8800.90] Dang it, guys.
[8801.32 → 8804.40] To provide you with food, beverages, and more during the expo.
[8804.56 → 8806.54] And a $5,000 PC.
[8807.76 → 8808.74] You get to...
[8808.74 → 8811.42] So you will use and keep the PC after the LAN.
[8811.54 → 8813.84] You'll get a gaming chair and peripherals to use during the LAN.
[8813.96 → 8814.90] Food and beverage station.
[8814.90 → 8818.34] And you get a plus one badge that includes two-day access to the expo.
[8818.46 → 8820.50] Chilling with the whales in the Whale land zone.
[8820.76 → 8822.70] Sitting with the whales in the main stage.
[8823.16 → 8825.30] And joining in the meet and greet in office and lab tour.
[8825.40 → 8831.40] Now, if you are not interested in the Whale VIP package, which understandably you might not be because it's $10,000.
[8832.26 → 8836.24] There's also add-ons for the LTX 2023 merch pack.
[8836.68 → 8838.70] Which, yes, tie-dye.
[8839.00 → 8839.40] Whoa!
[8840.72 → 8841.12] Boom.
[8841.92 → 8843.04] It's actually kind of sick.
[8843.26 → 8844.00] Sticker passport.
[8844.32 → 8844.62] It's very nebulous.
[8844.62 → 8845.46] This is an enamel pin.
[8847.28 → 8847.68] Okay.
[8847.76 → 8849.28] As with any tie-dye, by the way, guys.
[8849.36 → 8849.64] Remember.
[8849.78 → 8850.06] Remember.
[8850.20 → 8850.46] Remember.
[8851.14 → 8853.26] It'll look a little different from one to the next.
[8853.74 → 8854.04] Okay.
[8854.20 → 8856.10] There's also office tour.
[8856.44 → 8857.72] So you can get an office tour.
[8857.82 → 8858.72] You can get a labs tour.
[8858.72 → 8863.32] And then there's the Whale land merch pack, which is only available for Whale land attendees.
[8863.50 → 8869.62] So you'll have to make sure that you have some kind of, yes, BYOC Whale land in your cart.
[8869.68 → 8871.10] And then you can get the Whale land merch pack.
[8871.38 → 8872.62] Now, I'm a little confused.
[8872.72 → 8873.64] Where did our...
[8873.64 → 8874.36] I thought there were hoodies.
[8877.66 → 8877.98] Okay.
[8878.08 → 8879.00] Well, we'll have to figure that out.
[8879.06 → 8880.82] Anyway, this is what the site's going to look like.
[8881.20 → 8882.74] Is that in the merch pack?
[8882.86 → 8883.72] Oh, that'd be pretty cheap.
[8883.72 → 8885.24] There's a film release here, by the way.
[8885.42 → 8885.68] Blah, blah.
[8885.76 → 8886.82] While you're attending, et cetera.
[8886.82 → 8888.44] No different from any other expo.
[8888.72 → 8889.54] We're a YouTube channel.
[8889.90 → 8890.18] Yeah.
[8890.36 → 8890.62] Yeah.
[8890.68 → 8891.36] Believe it or not.
[8892.20 → 8895.90] And I think that's pretty much it for now.
[8896.88 → 8897.04] Yeah.
[8897.06 → 8900.96] I just wanted to kind of show you guys what it's going to look like so that it's not confusing
[8900.96 → 8901.82] at the time.
[8902.06 → 8902.34] Mm-hmm.
[8903.70 → 8904.32] 9 a.m.
[8904.38 → 8905.24] Pacific, Monday.
[8905.44 → 8905.62] Yep.
[8905.74 → 8906.66] February 6th.
[8906.92 → 8910.06] You will need to create a customer account in order to start the checkout process in the
[8910.06 → 8910.28] store.
[8910.64 → 8912.24] You can make the account now to be ready.
[8912.24 → 8915.86] So that's tickets.ltxexpo.com, I guess.
[8916.96 → 8919.32] Or I guess it should be linked down below at some point.
[8919.50 → 8919.98] Dan, thanks.
[8920.44 → 8921.94] Ticket prices are USD only.
[8922.12 → 8922.82] Items cannot be held.
[8922.88 → 8925.08] They go to whoever completes payment processing the fastest.
[8925.84 → 8931.66] If you're looking for specific questions or answers to your questions, the FAQ has been
[8931.66 → 8933.24] seriously updated.
[8933.24 → 8936.24] So there's a lot of good information in there.
[8938.66 → 8939.06] Cool.
[8939.74 → 8940.40] All right.
[8941.24 → 8942.06] Should we do some merch messages?
[8943.12 → 8943.60] Yeah.
[8944.12 → 8946.44] Wait, were there any big topics that we didn't get to yet?
[8946.62 → 8947.58] I don't think so.
[8947.72 → 8951.96] Oh, I mean, AMD and NVIDIA have been under shipping chips to keep prices higher.
[8952.30 → 8953.34] So that's cool.
[8954.00 → 8956.08] I'm so surprised they would do this.
[8956.10 → 8960.90] Remember how many times we've said that AMD is not your friend any more than NVIDIA or Intel
[8960.90 → 8968.30] are and like whatever their image is of being like super cool and your bro is complete nonsense?
[8968.72 → 8971.50] I won't say it because I want people to watch the video.
[8971.84 → 8976.54] But for the AMD challenge that we're currently doing, my GPU is installed in a way that I
[8976.54 → 8980.82] have never even thought about installing a GPU before.
[8981.30 → 8982.06] Good work.
[8982.18 → 8984.76] And it came to me after like a lot of contemplation.
[8985.14 → 8987.02] But it works technically.
[8987.02 → 8987.10] Exactly.
[8987.64 → 8993.14] So AMD has been shipping below production capacity for at least half a year to maintain prices
[8993.14 → 8994.02] despite lower demand.
[8994.16 → 8997.64] They'd plan to do the same, though less so, for the first quarter of this year.
[8998.62 → 9002.04] NVIDIA told its own investors that they were under shipping back in November.
[9002.52 → 9006.64] They then released the RTX 4080 and 4070 Ti at an inflated price point while the market
[9006.64 → 9007.94] for GPUs was tanking.
[9008.02 → 9008.62] Lol, got them.
[9009.16 → 9009.62] Buttholes.
[9011.40 → 9012.26] That's about it.
[9012.26 → 9015.04] Yeah.
[9015.64 → 9018.10] Intel Arc gets better drivers and a price drop.
[9018.30 → 9018.80] Let's go.
[9018.90 → 9019.66] Yeah, this is pretty cool.
[9019.74 → 9021.36] The A750 got a price drop.
[9021.46 → 9024.00] It's now down to, I believe, $250.
[9024.80 → 9025.06] Whoa.
[9025.26 → 9026.78] Which is like, yeah.
[9027.38 → 9029.86] What a solid mid-tier GPU should cost.
[9030.06 → 9030.26] Yeah.
[9030.38 → 9031.04] Let's go.
[9031.24 → 9031.46] Nice.
[9031.46 → 9034.94] They also got a big bump in performance.
[9035.42 → 9037.56] So is there a way for me to, oh, yes, here we go.
[9037.64 → 9038.52] I'll just kind of share my screen.
[9038.52 → 9042.26] These driver update performance boosts for Intel have been nuts.
[9042.48 → 9042.64] Yep.
[9042.68 → 9044.30] So this is compared to original.
[9044.68 → 9046.42] This is not just one driver update.
[9046.56 → 9047.60] This is compared to original.
[9047.80 → 9051.16] But there are some very substantial performance improvements here.
[9051.28 → 9052.50] And I love to see it.
[9052.72 → 9055.18] Going from 161 to 167 FPS.
[9055.40 → 9058.00] I don't know that I would have included that on the graphics.
[9058.12 → 9059.66] Same with 203 to 209.
[9059.66 → 9067.48] But, hey, there's some much bigger improvements in games like Star Craft 2, Stellar is, CSGO, League of Legends.
[9067.94 → 9068.76] Are there more different?
[9068.84 → 9069.96] Is League of Legends on here twice?
[9072.74 → 9073.52] Wait, what?
[9074.20 → 9074.42] Yeah.
[9074.46 → 9075.30] Oh, different resolutions?
[9075.84 → 9076.54] That makes sense.
[9077.34 → 9077.54] Cool.
[9078.02 → 9078.20] Yep.
[9079.08 → 9079.54] All right.
[9080.34 → 9080.74] Dan.
[9081.88 → 9082.24] Uh-oh.
[9082.62 → 9083.72] Hit me with some merch messages.
[9083.96 → 9085.22] Oh, I got a lot to hit you with.
[9087.08 → 9089.08] You probably want to go through some of the potentials.
[9089.08 → 9089.44] Okay.
[9089.58 → 9090.80] This one's from Joshi.
[9091.06 → 9093.20] I think I've heard of you before.
[9093.70 → 9094.74] Hi, Linus and Luke.
[9094.82 → 9096.34] I am a dental technician.
[9096.70 → 9098.44] A profession making teeth.
[9098.56 → 9099.18] Cool story, bro.
[9099.42 → 9105.08] CAD slash CAM production has been slowly but surely taking over what used to be custom craftsmanship field.
[9105.68 → 9105.78] Oh.
[9105.78 → 9111.18] Is there a profession where you didn't expect tech would take over?
[9111.18 → 9117.32] I didn't expect AI was going to come for creative this quickly.
[9118.00 → 9118.30] Yeah.
[9118.38 → 9119.48] And I don't think most people did.
[9119.90 → 9125.62] Because the advice for a long time in the past was like, oh, you want like an AI resistant job?
[9126.26 → 9127.32] Try to get into creative.
[9127.96 → 9128.28] Yeah.
[9128.28 → 9131.60] And this year's all been like AI music, AI art, AI writing.
[9131.76 → 9134.56] Well, the predictions have been just kind of all over the place.
[9134.74 → 9150.28] Like, I remember talking to you about this, but it was pretty obvious to anyone with a pretty good understanding of the processing power at the time that back when Tesla claimed that every car they were shipping today would be capable of full self-driving with software updates.
[9150.28 → 9156.10] It was pretty clear that nothing existed that was going to be close.
[9156.30 → 9158.08] Like, it's obviously not going to happen.
[9158.60 → 9168.18] But there was still a lot of anxiety, I think, at the time about getting into, say, driving as a profession because the robots are coming for those jobs.
[9168.36 → 9171.62] But that is obviously so far out now.
[9172.18 → 9178.26] Like, it's just, I think it's clear to everyone that the promises were nonsense.
[9178.26 → 9192.24] And whether it's just general operation or whether it's going to be those little edge cases that they're hunting down, it's going to take many more years and a lot more hardware iterations before we actually get there.
[9193.34 → 9200.04] But then, yeah, on the flip side, I didn't think we were going to see a chatbot that could interact so naturally.
[9201.14 → 9202.62] I wouldn't have even tried to guess.
[9202.80 → 9203.80] I don't know.
[9204.06 → 9204.78] Far off.
[9204.96 → 9205.14] Yeah.
[9205.26 → 9206.18] Ages from now.
[9206.18 → 9210.72] I mean, Google can barely call the correct contact in my phone when I use my voice assistant.
[9210.84 → 9211.42] Like, they're useless.
[9211.64 → 9212.88] If anything, we're regressing.
[9213.04 → 9215.58] Like, I just, I thought we were so far away.
[9215.66 → 9216.36] And then, boom!
[9216.82 → 9217.50] Here it is.
[9217.62 → 9217.90] Wow.
[9219.22 → 9219.62] Yeah.
[9220.44 → 9221.98] So it's kind of a non-answer.
[9222.16 → 9223.54] But I don't know.
[9223.96 → 9227.08] Is there one you didn't expect tech would take over for me?
[9227.08 → 9233.98] As generally, like, a technophile, I kind of, you know, I'm, like, rooting for tech.
[9234.04 → 9235.56] I'm like, yeah, things should be easier.
[9240.40 → 9240.92] I'm sorry.
[9240.96 → 9241.90] I can't really think of anything.
[9242.94 → 9243.48] You know what?
[9243.48 → 9247.24] I didn't think tech would be able to take over for, like, cashiers.
[9249.22 → 9249.62] Really?
[9250.36 → 9251.06] As quickly.
[9251.38 → 9252.60] I didn't think it would happen so fast.
[9253.12 → 9255.94] I was pretty impressed by the Amazon Go store back when I checked it out.
[9256.46 → 9257.62] Ah, that's, yeah.
[9257.82 → 9259.80] That's a little more advanced than most.
[9260.52 → 9262.42] Yeah, but it exists.
[9262.56 → 9262.78] Yeah.
[9262.94 → 9264.38] It exists, and it works and it's now.
[9264.44 → 9266.46] That one I did not expect to exist.
[9266.46 → 9270.04] I think the like, self-checkout stuff, though, is not surprising to me.
[9270.18 → 9270.28] Yeah.
[9272.40 → 9272.84] Okay.
[9272.88 → 9274.06] I got one here from Quentin.
[9274.64 → 9277.90] Linus, I've been interested in your videos regarding your personal monitor at home.
[9278.24 → 9282.20] Do you prefer the 42-inch or the 48-inch OLED monitors?
[9282.62 → 9286.22] I'm interested in buying an Asus DOG Swift 47-inch.
[9287.08 → 9290.04] Not sure where to go with the 42 or the 48.
[9290.32 → 9291.58] Did you just call it DOG?
[9292.06 → 9292.32] Yeah.
[9292.82 → 9295.16] Whatever I can do to offend as many people as possible.
[9295.16 → 9300.00] So, the Asus, trademark, Republic of Gamers copyright.
[9300.40 → 9301.26] All right, all right, all right, all right.
[9302.52 → 9304.44] I definitely prefer 42.
[9304.92 → 9306.46] There is no question for me.
[9306.58 → 9311.14] Now, I mean, you can go back and forth on whether you want, like, a matte screen or a glossy screen
[9311.14 → 9315.42] or it's important to have a higher refresh rate or this is enough or, like, all the other specs.
[9316.18 → 9319.06] Completely aside, 48 is too big.
[9319.30 → 9323.94] I've switched to 42 both at work and at home, and I'm not going to go back to 48 inches.
[9324.04 → 9324.96] It's just a little bit too big.
[9325.16 → 9325.56] Okay.
[9327.88 → 9329.10] Next one here is from Austin.
[9329.84 → 9335.48] What is your most memorable interview, either as the interviewer or the interviewee?
[9335.48 → 9344.70] I've talked about this before, but I think bringing Chris Peril lo and Tom Merritt on the WAN show had to be by far the most eye-opening.
[9344.92 → 9345.86] They weren't really interviews.
[9346.08 → 9348.58] They were more like having people on as guests.
[9348.58 → 9351.78] But they were super cool.
[9351.90 → 9355.20] I'm probably forgetting about some actual interviews I've done.
[9355.54 → 9357.98] I don't do a ton of them.
[9358.08 → 9359.28] We've never done a ton.
[9359.36 → 9360.64] We've never been a huge fan of them.
[9360.64 → 9361.08] Yeah.
[9361.08 → 9369.54] The Chris Peril lo WAN show for me in particular was a bit eye-opening in regard to, like, how long the road ahead was, if you know what I mean.
[9369.76 → 9369.96] Yeah.
[9369.96 → 9371.32] Man, we're not that good.
[9371.42 → 9371.58] Yeah.
[9371.62 → 9372.42] I was like, whoa.
[9372.60 → 9372.88] Okay.
[9373.98 → 9375.46] There's quite a ways to go.
[9375.82 → 9380.42] For me, though, it would be Palmer Lucky at PAX East in the like, prime of Oculus.
[9380.42 → 9388.00] Oculus, I was, we just could not get anyone from Oculus to respond to us at all, if you remember that.
[9388.16 → 9388.34] I do.
[9388.48 → 9389.96] That was super, super frustrating.
[9390.22 → 9401.46] And then I got to, like, physically get in his face at the show, and he was like, oh, hey, I've seen your, like, reviews of our hardware.
[9401.86 → 9403.22] And I was like, that's cool.
[9403.32 → 9405.08] Why won't anyone respond to me?
[9405.14 → 9407.06] And he was very surprised by that.
[9407.06 → 9411.14] And he ended up getting, like, forcing someone to respond to me, which was nice.
[9411.34 → 9413.54] But, like, that was actually a pretty cool interview.
[9413.72 → 9415.76] And luckily it got us an Oculus contact.
[9417.18 → 9417.66] But.
[9418.18 → 9418.62] Temporarily.
[9419.00 → 9420.36] Until Oculus didn't exist anymore.
[9420.58 → 9422.16] Until they got exploded.
[9422.64 → 9428.52] Probably most of my best interviews have been, or were not interviews.
[9428.74 → 9431.32] Like, really, really smart people I got to talk to.
[9431.32 → 9434.74] Like, when I went down and did that collab with Smarter Every Day.
[9434.74 → 9437.82] And I forget his last name, Telly or something like that.
[9437.92 → 9440.48] But Luke, the guy who worked on, different Luke, not you.
[9440.80 → 9445.62] Who worked on the Saturn V.
[9445.98 → 9448.80] I was like, just super smart.
[9448.90 → 9451.12] The guy just, like, knew so much.
[9451.68 → 9457.42] And, you know, I didn't really, you know, make an interview video.
[9457.42 → 9461.64] Because I prefer to keep our own voice and our own energy on the channel.
[9461.98 → 9466.42] But I've definitely had the pleasure of talking to some incredibly smart people.
[9466.54 → 9471.74] I mean, I can tell you guys now that, like, the Intel factory tour, Micron factory tour, stuff like that.
[9472.08 → 9477.02] I got to talk to people and hear things that will never see the light of day.
[9477.10 → 9478.04] But were awesome.
[9478.04 → 9479.68] And I'm sorry that they can't be an interview.
[9479.80 → 9480.84] But they just aren't.
[9480.84 → 9493.98] Some of the like, OVH engineers and shadow virtualization techs that I was able to talk to and was, like, super not able to include what they were talking about in the video was pretty sick.
[9495.72 → 9499.28] There's some smart people out there creating the stuff that we use every day.
[9499.34 → 9500.20] Don't take it for granted.
[9500.56 → 9500.68] Yeah.
[9500.68 → 9503.14] Okay.
[9503.20 → 9504.22] I've got one here from Nicole.
[9504.68 → 9505.44] Hey, Linus and Luke.
[9505.72 → 9512.66] Linus, you had mentioned before that back in the day you used to buy the latest GPU and then flip it before the next card would come out.
[9513.08 → 9516.66] Was there ever a card that you ever regretted selling and or buying?
[9518.48 → 9518.92] No.
[9518.92 → 9540.94] Because, remember, back then in the mid-2000s, like, 2010s, early 2010s, it just got so much better all the time that there was just, there was, if there was one that I could regret even a little, it would have been the 8800 GTS SLI setup I had.
[9541.18 → 9547.64] Because when the 8800 GT came out, not that much longer, it was so cheap and so fast.
[9547.64 → 9557.86] Like, it was priced like a GTS but performed like a GTX, especially with a little bit of overclocking and water cooling and that kind of stuff that I was into back in the day.
[9558.76 → 9562.74] That it kind of made me feel like, oh, this might not have been that great of a choice.
[9562.74 → 9566.14] But, I mean, I don't know.
[9566.30 → 9572.06] It was just part of the fun of it almost that you got to, yeah, you got to enjoy it while you had it.
[9572.06 → 9579.26] And as long as you moved fast before everyone figured out the new hotness, then it wasn't that bad.
[9580.62 → 9580.74] Yeah.
[9585.46 → 9586.38] Hello, wife.
[9586.50 → 9586.92] One moment.
[9587.36 → 9587.90] Can I help you?
[9587.90 → 9597.38] It depends on how many of these potential merch messages make their way into curated merch messages.
[9597.50 → 9597.98] I'm so sorry.
[9599.16 → 9602.56] You're more than welcome to just join us on the show, but I don't know if we have a microphone for you.
[9604.26 → 9605.28] Or you can just go.
[9606.10 → 9607.70] Do we have two cars today?
[9608.40 → 9610.12] Oh, so that one's not out of the shop?
[9610.96 → 9613.14] Oh, because Luke can't drive me today.
[9613.24 → 9613.54] That's okay.
[9613.58 → 9614.10] I'll Uber home.
[9614.40 → 9614.84] Are you sure?
[9614.94 → 9615.28] Yeah, yeah.
[9615.72 → 9616.30] See you later.
[9616.30 → 9616.86] Sorry.
[9617.90 → 9618.78] Way to go, Luke.
[9619.00 → 9619.60] All my fault.
[9620.04 → 9620.40] Basically.
[9620.70 → 9620.86] Yep.
[9625.24 → 9625.64] Okay.
[9626.04 → 9626.92] This one's from Patrick.
[9627.44 → 9632.62] Linus, a few WAN shows ago you mentioned you would rather learn a musical instrument as opposed to a programming language.
[9632.98 → 9634.98] Which musical instrument would you learn and why?
[9635.92 → 9638.50] I'm totally unimaginative, so I would just go for the violin.
[9639.94 → 9641.76] It's pretty bold.
[9642.68 → 9643.92] This one's from Hetman.
[9643.92 → 9644.98] Go straight for violin.
[9645.50 → 9645.86] Hardest.
[9646.00 → 9646.60] Hard mode.
[9646.70 → 9647.18] Hard mode.
[9647.18 → 9648.22] Hard mode.
[9649.16 → 9649.56] Insane.
[9649.64 → 9650.46] I just like how it sounds.
[9650.86 → 9651.32] It's good.
[9651.92 → 9656.92] Hetman, finally picking up one of the items I've wanted for a long time, including this screwdriver and workshop jacket.
[9657.28 → 9660.20] I'm about to start coaching my old high school's gymnastic team.
[9660.52 → 9664.02] I was wondering what sports have you done, and what's been your biggest takeaways?
[9666.40 → 9669.78] I'll let Luke go, and I will rest for a while.
[9669.78 → 9672.58] What sports have I done?
[9672.58 → 9672.60] What sports have I done?
[9672.88 → 9676.34] That's genuinely a tough question because I sometimes forget some of them.
[9676.90 → 9678.44] I've done a lot of stuff, though.
[9678.44 → 9680.72] What was the end of the...
[9680.72 → 9682.70] What are my takeaways from playing sports?
[9682.82 → 9683.16] Yeah, exactly.
[9686.28 → 9687.18] Holy...
[9687.18 → 9689.14] That's an extensive potential question.
[9690.28 → 9704.08] One of the biggest ones for me is that I found a lot of value from playing sports in how you learn how to deal with people and work as a team and be a unit.
[9704.08 → 9706.82] And how you learn...
[9706.82 → 9710.40] I don't think people that don't play sports necessarily actually get this lesson.
[9710.82 → 9713.14] How you learn that it kind of sucks to suck.
[9714.62 → 9719.38] And not just because you lose, but because you might drag your team down.
[9720.20 → 9723.08] And why that putting in effort outside of like...
[9723.90 → 9727.42] Rod, Luke hit the crap out of me playing bubble soccer.
[9727.76 → 9729.22] Sorry, yeah, I do remember that, actually.
[9730.72 → 9732.26] Sometimes I just...
[9732.26 → 9733.34] Yeah, there are certain things...
[9733.34 → 9734.78] My brother and I are the same way.
[9734.84 → 9736.88] There are certain things that will just make us see red suddenly.
[9737.46 → 9738.70] We both played a lot of football.
[9738.88 → 9741.42] If you cross your feet, things are going down.
[9742.46 → 9744.94] Because people don't have very good balance, and they cross your feet.
[9745.00 → 9746.02] So it's the perfect time to hit them.
[9746.26 → 9746.50] Anyway.
[9748.62 → 9750.04] But yeah, I don't know.
[9750.04 → 9755.48] It teaches you a lot about being on a team and how to be a valuable member of being on a team.
[9756.58 → 9762.92] And that, I think, is the most valuable type of knowledge that I pulled from playing sports, I think.
[9763.34 → 9768.30] Is that like being bad doesn't just suck for you.
[9768.30 → 9772.50] And you need to try to improve if you can.
[9773.06 → 9779.94] And if you can't, try to find a different way to utilize yourself on said team or whatever it is.
[9781.00 → 9783.66] I was never successful in a team sport, believe it or not.
[9783.86 → 9788.30] I'm not a particularly gifted athlete, and I'm not big, which is...
[9788.94 → 9790.46] A lot of Western sports...
[9790.46 → 9790.96] Not great.
[9791.34 → 9792.60] ...benefit like being big.
[9792.70 → 9792.92] Yeah.
[9793.10 → 9793.38] Oh, yeah.
[9793.38 → 9795.28] Other than maybe jockeying.
[9795.42 → 9796.04] But you're good at badminton.
[9796.40 → 9797.44] I'm pretty good at badminton.
[9797.68 → 9797.86] Yep.
[9798.42 → 9805.22] And I was like pretty good at, you know, whatever, like essentially like kind of taekwondo is what I did when I was in high school.
[9805.36 → 9806.04] What sports did you try?
[9806.04 → 9812.58] Um, I mean, I played on a baseball team when I was like a kid, kid.
[9812.72 → 9814.22] I don't see baseball being your sport.
[9814.62 → 9815.86] No, it really wasn't.
[9815.94 → 9817.36] I could not focus.
[9817.76 → 9820.26] There's a lot of standing around in baseball.
[9821.66 → 9823.28] That's not going to work.
[9823.44 → 9824.36] I sucked at soccer.
[9824.76 → 9825.10] Terrible.
[9825.78 → 9826.18] Terrible.
[9826.20 → 9827.02] That's actually surprising.
[9827.10 → 9828.40] Yeah, no, that was no good.
[9828.52 → 9828.82] Interesting.
[9828.92 → 9829.06] Yeah.
[9829.52 → 9830.90] I didn't play for long though.
[9831.24 → 9835.32] So maybe a part of it was that I was playing with kids that had been playing for a few years already.
[9835.32 → 9838.04] You might have also gotten a little bit distracted depending on your position.
[9838.14 → 9839.02] Yeah, I didn't last.
[9839.48 → 9840.22] In soccer.
[9841.22 → 9841.84] Oh, man.
[9841.94 → 9844.34] I could see you being a very good hooker in rugby.
[9844.58 → 9845.78] I was on swim team.
[9846.60 → 9846.96] And let me know.
[9847.04 → 9848.88] They tried to recruit me for the rugby team.
[9848.88 → 9849.38] Did you ever try it?
[9849.38 → 9850.80] Actually, I didn't like it.
[9850.86 → 9851.60] It's cold and wet.
[9852.34 → 9852.76] Like, no.
[9853.08 → 9854.94] That's going to be an issue for a lot of Western sports.
[9855.60 → 9856.84] You're just like out in fields.
[9857.50 → 9860.04] Yeah, no, like in grade nine or something.
[9860.78 → 9861.46] Like, I actually.
[9861.46 → 9863.12] I bet you would have actually been quite good at that.
[9863.12 → 9868.20] I had my opportunity to be one of the cool kids when like one of the like cool guys who
[9868.20 → 9873.22] was huge and was like on the rugby team and popular because we had to do a rugby unit in
[9873.22 → 9876.40] gym was like, oh, yeah, you'd actually be perfect at this.
[9876.40 → 9878.74] And I was like, dude, it's raining.
[9882.42 → 9883.44] Oh, come on.
[9883.48 → 9884.32] It's like October.
[9885.10 → 9886.30] What's wrong with you?
[9886.36 → 9888.84] I'm going inside as soon as I possibly can.
[9888.84 → 9890.78] I was on swim team.
[9891.60 → 9891.92] Terrible.
[9892.98 → 9893.22] Terrible.
[9893.34 → 9894.24] You're not really built for that.
[9894.34 → 9895.68] No, not really built for swimming.
[9895.94 → 9896.12] Yeah.
[9896.24 → 9896.50] Yeah.
[9897.96 → 9899.02] I don't know what to tell you.
[9899.64 → 9903.14] Individual sports for me where I can't let anybody down but myself.
[9905.24 → 9906.32] What was the team again?
[9906.36 → 9907.24] It was a volleyball team.
[9907.30 → 9908.10] I think they said.
[9908.22 → 9909.16] What team are they coaching?
[9909.64 → 9910.12] The question.
[9910.30 → 9910.74] I don't remember.
[9910.82 → 9911.60] I don't have it on my screen.
[9911.82 → 9912.10] Gymnastics.
[9912.28 → 9912.60] That's right.
[9912.76 → 9913.04] Gymnastics.
[9913.18 → 9914.66] Oh, I'm not going to be able to help you at all.
[9915.04 → 9915.26] Yep.
[9915.40 → 9915.66] Sorry.
[9915.76 → 9916.64] I got nothing for you.
[9916.64 → 9920.06] I got a fun one here from Ryan.
[9920.24 → 9923.22] If you were forced to rename the WAN show, what would you call it?
[9923.76 → 9924.26] Oh, no.
[9924.94 → 9925.42] Land show.
[9925.88 → 9926.54] Land show.
[9926.74 → 9928.04] We got the WAN show earlier.
[9928.34 → 9929.88] Luke can line his bulls** hour.
[9931.50 → 9933.94] And then we'd have an asterisk, actually three hours.
[9936.94 → 9937.72] Oh, man.
[9939.44 → 9940.74] I mean, that's what it is now.
[9941.64 → 9943.18] Yeah, we're just about over.
[9943.94 → 9944.82] Carpool critics.
[9944.82 → 9947.72] Oh, you're going to make f***ING trolls.
[9947.92 → 9949.28] You're going to make some enemies there.
[9951.04 → 9951.80] Let's go.
[9951.92 → 9953.98] A WAN show is a pretty good suggestion.
[9955.98 → 9957.96] Let's get this one from Mary.
[9958.20 → 9961.00] Hi, I just used my single shoelace in a costume.
[9961.50 → 9963.18] It turned out great winning an award.
[9963.60 → 9965.50] Thanks for your consistent great quality.
[9966.04 → 9969.86] Luke and Linus, is there anything you have or would like to cosplay?
[9969.86 → 9974.78] I don't have the patience to build a good cosplay.
[9975.50 → 9975.86] I just...
[9976.88 → 9977.86] Man, the dedication.
[9978.92 → 9981.94] And I don't like doing anything crappy, I guess.
[9982.30 → 9984.32] I don't do much.
[9985.02 → 9986.86] I do raising kids.
[9987.32 → 9987.86] I do YouTube.
[9988.82 → 9989.62] I do badminton.
[9989.62 → 9992.22] You do a lot.
[9992.30 → 9993.78] What you do doesn't vary a lot.
[9993.96 → 9994.28] Sure.
[9994.74 → 9996.18] Yeah, I do a lot of those things.
[9996.24 → 9996.78] I go deep.
[9996.84 → 9997.64] I don't go wide.
[9997.88 → 9998.00] Yeah.
[9998.20 → 10005.80] And so, I guess, you know, if I were to cosplay, I would have to basically drop one of those
[10005.80 → 10007.04] other aspects of my life.
[10007.22 → 10008.08] It takes a lot of time.
[10008.08 → 10009.28] None of which are happening.
[10009.72 → 10010.40] There's a lot of skill involved.
[10010.66 → 10010.76] Yeah.
[10010.84 → 10011.90] And time.
[10012.16 → 10012.34] Yeah.
[10012.34 → 10016.22] Even with all the skill in the world, it still takes time.
[10016.46 → 10017.36] And I don't have it.
[10020.18 → 10020.58] Yeah.
[10020.66 → 10021.02] I don't know.
[10021.16 → 10023.10] If I had to pick something, though.
[10024.14 → 10025.60] Like, oh, man.
[10025.60 → 10026.22] I have no clue.
[10026.44 → 10026.66] Yeah.
[10026.80 → 10028.94] I don't even know.
[10029.08 → 10031.98] A lot of stuff that I was thinking about is just so generic that it hurts.
[10031.98 → 10032.30] Yeah.
[10033.42 → 10033.98] I don't know.
[10034.54 → 10036.26] Locke from Final Fantasy VI.
[10036.42 → 10037.12] I don't know.
[10037.38 → 10037.74] Yeah.
[10037.84 → 10038.86] I don't know what to tell you.
[10038.86 → 10039.40] I mean...
[10039.40 → 10041.52] That would basically be just putting on a bandana, though.
[10041.52 → 10043.36] So I guess I could probably pull it off.
[10043.96 → 10046.30] Why don't you cosplay as each other?
[10046.40 → 10047.40] You're both well-known enough.
[10047.68 → 10048.26] I think we already do.
[10048.26 → 10048.88] Do we ever do that?
[10049.30 → 10050.06] Do you do that?
[10050.08 → 10051.20] I think we do all the time.
[10051.24 → 10051.52] Well, yeah.
[10051.54 → 10052.56] We don't look that different.
[10052.70 → 10053.12] I mean...
[10053.12 → 10054.18] Do we...
[10054.18 → 10055.80] Yeah, we do our hair in the right direction.
[10056.00 → 10056.56] Your mirrors.
[10056.56 → 10057.20] Okay, so hold on.
[10058.80 → 10061.04] I should just mirror the Sancho set.
[10061.28 → 10061.68] Cosplay!
[10062.20 → 10062.56] Cosplay.
[10062.80 → 10063.20] Hey!
[10063.66 → 10064.02] Wow.
[10065.46 → 10066.38] I'm moving on.
[10066.48 → 10067.02] I'm moving on.
[10067.22 → 10068.56] This one's from Alex.
[10068.92 → 10069.46] Hey, Linus.
[10069.46 → 10069.82] Question.
[10070.30 → 10071.50] What do you think about Microsoft?
[10071.52 → 10077.24] Microsoft's inability to compete against Apple on the laptop slash mini PCs on efficiency
[10077.24 → 10077.94] and power.
[10078.38 → 10083.84] They are the only other company that compete vertically with OS, custom ARM chips, etc.,
[10083.84 → 10084.68] but hasn't.
[10084.72 → 10085.34] I mean, they've tried.
[10085.34 → 10090.76] The problem is that what's good about the Windows ecosystem is backwards compatibility.
[10090.76 → 10099.90] And Apple, I think, really surprised everyone when Rosetta 2 was good, when it was actually usable.
[10099.90 → 10108.26] Being able to run X86 legacy programs on their ARM processors was mind-blowing.
[10108.26 → 10112.86] I'm sure there's a team at Microsoft hard at work on that right now.
[10113.14 → 10114.06] Or maybe not.
[10114.10 → 10114.48] I don't know.
[10114.54 → 10116.52] Like, how much of their revenue is even Windows anymore?
[10116.72 → 10120.32] I mean, if they manage to out-compete Google in search, maybe they just won't care.
[10120.32 → 10124.88] That was a ramble response, but that's kind of everything I have to say about it.
[10127.04 → 10127.52] Okay.
[10127.58 → 10129.04] This one here is from Joshua.
[10129.04 → 10135.40] As a swimmer, I hear there are lots of fish in the sea, but all I see are many sea anemones.
[10135.96 → 10142.38] As a partner to individuals, any dating advice for us computer nerds that don't live in mom's basement?
[10142.38 → 10147.16] He's past the online dating era.
[10147.80 → 10148.18] Yeah.
[10148.18 → 10152.10] Like, I haven't been in the game in, like, 19 years.
[10152.74 → 10153.22] I don't...
[10153.22 → 10153.90] I actually...
[10153.90 → 10156.40] Like, to me, online dating...
[10156.40 → 10163.62] And, like, obviously, I'm aware that it's, like, chill or whatever and totally socially normal now.
[10163.88 → 10164.52] Seems weird, though.
[10164.70 → 10169.92] But when I was last dating, it was weird.
[10169.92 → 10176.14] Like, I would have no idea where to even start with modern dating.
[10176.48 → 10177.52] Not even a clue.
[10178.80 → 10180.30] I know what not to do.
[10181.16 → 10185.74] I know definitely not to use my influence to groom people, like minors.
[10186.38 → 10191.22] I've learned from my fellow YouTubers and Twitch streamers that that is actually not okay.
[10192.70 → 10196.16] But I wouldn't know what to do.
[10196.78 → 10198.22] I was never good at it.
[10198.22 → 10199.78] I, uh...
[10199.78 → 10202.62] I hated the online apps.
[10203.58 → 10208.22] But the very short period of time that I was looking for dates using online apps...
[10208.82 → 10214.46] Like, a lot of other people were kind of feeling uneasy about it, too.
[10214.54 → 10215.60] Because it was kind of the very beginning.
[10215.86 → 10217.34] So I just didn't use them.
[10217.34 → 10218.58] Um...
[10218.58 → 10222.42] I would, like, go to chapters, which I don't think exists anymore.
[10222.70 → 10223.06] Indigo.
[10223.44 → 10223.90] A bookstore.
[10224.46 → 10224.72] Sure.
[10224.88 → 10225.28] There we go.
[10225.74 → 10226.18] Um...
[10226.18 → 10232.40] And just, like, peruse interesting sections and just try to, like, see if I could spark up an interesting conversation.
[10232.40 → 10236.96] Uh, one time I was on a bus and this lady sat next to me.
[10237.30 → 10245.38] So I texted my friend about how I was, like, wondering if I should ask them out.
[10245.80 → 10248.12] But did it in a way that they could see my phone.
[10250.00 → 10251.30] That worked, actually.
[10251.42 → 10252.24] That is very awkward, though.
[10252.24 → 10252.52] That worked.
[10253.08 → 10255.92] I mean, I'm not denying that it could be successful.
[10256.08 → 10257.24] I'm just saying, like...
[10257.24 → 10258.04] Nailed it.
[10258.14 → 10258.86] Tried it one time.
[10258.94 → 10259.96] 100% success rate.
[10260.16 → 10261.02] Guaranteed to function.
[10261.16 → 10261.52] Okay.
[10261.52 → 10261.64] Okay.
[10262.72 → 10263.60] Yeah, I don't know.
[10263.78 → 10265.18] I don't drink.
[10266.30 → 10268.88] So back then, the thing was just, like, go to bars.
[10270.42 → 10270.82] Yeah.
[10271.12 → 10274.30] So I was like, okay, I don't want to go to clubs or bars because I don't drink.
[10274.54 → 10276.40] And those places are not as great.
[10276.48 → 10278.20] Hey, mocktails are apparently cool now.
[10278.20 → 10286.22] So you can spend way too much on a drink to not even get buzzed and think that it's okay.
[10286.52 → 10286.72] Fantastic.
[10287.02 → 10287.58] Yeah, that's great.
[10287.76 → 10288.34] So I don't know.
[10288.50 → 10298.12] A lot of my stuff was just winging it because the only advice I'd get from anyone was go to bars, go to clubs, or use online dating.
[10298.12 → 10300.30] I was like, well, I don't drink, so the first two are out.
[10300.72 → 10303.76] And online dating seems super weird, so the third one's kind of out.
[10303.76 → 10308.58] And I never met a girl anywhere other than Christian summer camp and school.
[10310.48 → 10312.14] You're asking the wrong people.
[10315.90 → 10318.10] My takeaway is there's no hope for you.
[10319.22 → 10320.08] Okay, Joseph.
[10320.20 → 10322.28] Yeah, we both better hang on to what we've got.
[10322.46 → 10324.70] Yeah, because we'd be screwed.
[10325.30 → 10327.20] Neither of us have any idea what we're supposed to do.
[10328.46 → 10328.86] Lost.
[10329.00 → 10329.68] Poor guys.
[10330.40 → 10332.50] Joseph, even given the experience.
[10332.50 → 10333.08] Sorry, sorry.
[10333.08 → 10334.04] Okay, go for it.
[10334.08 → 10337.34] If we lost, there was the fish in the sea analogy, right?
[10337.66 → 10343.20] If we were dumped, we'd be like the random turtle that's swimming with the fish or whatever.
[10344.14 → 10345.08] I'm lost.
[10345.22 → 10346.72] I don't know where I'm supposed to be.
[10347.86 → 10348.30] Siri?
[10348.54 → 10349.20] Hello, Siri?
[10350.00 → 10351.16] Sir, that's an android.
[10351.34 → 10351.80] This is a Wendy's.
[10351.80 → 10353.28] ChatGPT, how do I do the dating?
[10353.90 → 10354.64] Please help.
[10356.78 → 10357.90] Sorry, you can go.
[10358.08 → 10358.34] Yeah.
[10359.00 → 10359.88] No, it's fine.
[10360.34 → 10361.60] People come here for this.
[10361.60 → 10364.82] Okay, this one's from Joseph.
[10365.42 → 10370.18] Even given the experience and professionalism of everyone at LMG, accidents happen.
[10370.54 → 10374.62] What are some of the more serious things that have happened while on the job over the years?
[10374.82 → 10375.16] I don't know.
[10375.24 → 10377.96] There was that time I leaked the entire payroll of the company on Web.
[10377.96 → 10383.88] There was that time a few hours ago when you leaked the Facebook streaming key.
[10384.72 → 10384.86] What?
[10385.08 → 10385.92] Oh, was that today?
[10386.12 → 10387.12] That was broken anyway.
[10387.28 → 10389.98] Your email to Nick Light about new product ideas.
[10390.14 → 10390.42] Oh.
[10390.78 → 10393.04] You had emailed me the streaming key.
[10393.20 → 10393.58] Yeah, we saw that.
[10393.58 → 10393.92] There it is.
[10394.06 → 10395.18] It's right at the top there.
[10395.28 → 10396.52] Oh, it's the whole thing.
[10397.14 → 10398.46] Well, it's also wrong.
[10398.62 → 10399.00] It's wrong.
[10399.00 → 10399.82] That one didn't work.
[10400.04 → 10400.24] Yeah.
[10400.24 → 10400.86] Oh, cool.
[10400.88 → 10401.98] But we updated it anyway.
[10402.22 → 10404.74] That's what I was doing on my phone when you guys were talking.
[10404.74 → 10405.12] I was wondering about that.
[10405.18 → 10405.36] Yeah.
[10406.26 → 10406.86] Good job.
[10407.64 → 10408.24] I don't know.
[10409.90 → 10410.72] Accidents happen.
[10410.90 → 10411.88] Serious things that have happened.
[10411.88 → 10414.78] There was the time that Colton Copyright struck our own channel twice.
[10416.28 → 10418.34] In fairly rapid succession, if I remember correctly.
[10418.34 → 10418.96] Yeah, that's pretty good.
[10419.56 → 10421.36] I mean, you pretty much name it.
[10421.42 → 10421.94] Something's gone.
[10422.04 → 10423.70] It's gone wrong at some point or another.
[10424.00 → 10424.20] Yeah.
[10424.32 → 10429.20] I mean, we uploaded, man, back in the day, we uploaded entire videos with missing audio
[10429.20 → 10429.70] and stuff.
[10430.82 → 10432.60] There's one that's still live.
[10432.72 → 10437.30] My video on NVIDIA's 3D Vision glasses is just missing audio for most of it.
[10437.36 → 10439.56] And I just, I forget what I did.
[10439.64 → 10440.84] Did I caption it or something?
[10440.94 → 10441.58] I don't even remember.
[10442.12 → 10444.14] I was just like, well, I can't re-record it.
[10444.24 → 10445.98] So the box is open now.
[10447.16 → 10447.30] Yeah.
[10447.30 → 10450.84] Apparently there was that time that you leaked the fixed shaft screwdrivers.
[10451.66 → 10453.70] Well, yeah, but that I meant to do that.
[10454.62 → 10455.40] Yeah, here we go.
[10455.50 → 10458.32] NVIDIA GeForce 3D Vision glasses unboxing.
[10458.32 → 10458.98] The intro!
[10459.74 → 10460.62] Let's go!
[10461.62 → 10462.64] Voice cracking everything.
[10462.96 → 10463.80] I'm ready for dating.
[10464.76 → 10465.60] Oh, do you guys want to hear this?
[10465.78 → 10465.98] No.
[10466.30 → 10466.52] Okay.
[10467.74 → 10468.54] I mean, sure.
[10469.38 → 10469.74] Okay.
[10470.08 → 10470.68] This is epic.
[10471.02 → 10471.78] What is this from?
[10471.84 → 10472.38] Did I film this?
[10472.38 → 10473.02] We're doing a voiceover.
[10473.30 → 10473.78] No.
[10473.90 → 10477.26] We're unboxing the NVIDIA GeForce for the land.
[10477.30 → 10478.16] Of sorts outside.
[10478.46 → 10479.52] I think two takes.
[10479.84 → 10480.30] Look at this.
[10480.42 → 10481.34] Look at these clothes.
[10481.52 → 10482.26] What am I even doing?
[10483.18 → 10483.72] Look at this.
[10483.76 → 10484.40] Look at this guy.
[10484.52 → 10485.84] Why don't wear such big clothes?
[10485.84 → 10486.70] The infrared transmitter.
[10487.44 → 10488.52] That hooks up to your computer.
[10489.12 → 10491.64] I'm figuring out, really, I have no idea what I'm doing here.
[10491.74 → 10494.56] Like, I've never seen any of this stuff before when I'm opening up the box.
[10494.58 → 10496.10] Why is this a voiceover?
[10496.10 → 10497.50] I'm about to put on the glasses for the very first time.
[10497.50 → 10498.26] Because the audio was missing.
[10498.26 → 10499.14] You can see there.
[10499.72 → 10501.48] So here's me struggling to open the box.
[10501.92 → 10505.36] We're about to do it today because our microphone.
[10506.08 → 10506.66] Oh, yeah.
[10506.70 → 10507.02] There it is.
[10507.10 → 10507.18] There it is.
[10507.18 → 10512.64] We had the receiver for it on the camera, but I wasn't actually wearing it.
[10512.72 → 10516.56] So the camera microphone turns off when I don't have that.
[10516.56 → 10518.34] So here's me struggling to open the box.
[10518.82 → 10524.42] We're about to demonstrate, I think, that I'm actually standing in a swamp land of sorts outside our office.
[10525.00 → 10529.98] We didn't have the lights today, so we thought we'd just film it outside with the natural light.
[10531.06 → 10532.74] Very natural experience overall.
[10532.74 → 10535.92] So there's the carrying pouch for the glasses.
[10536.74 → 10538.74] And then next you'll...
[10538.74 → 10540.14] Beautiful.
[10540.84 → 10542.74] Completely f***ING unwatchable.
[10543.12 → 10543.22] Amazing.
[10543.58 → 10546.08] How did this happen?
[10546.08 → 10548.52] I clearly don't deserve it.
[10550.46 → 10552.96] What's really remarkable is you didn't get any better.
[10554.68 → 10557.02] Okay, next one before you fire me.
[10557.18 → 10558.46] This is from Andre.
[10558.80 → 10560.72] Do you have any odd PC habits?
[10560.72 → 10566.78] I got taken aback by an answer on a previous WAN show to use two trackball mice to improve shortcut capabilities.
[10567.00 → 10570.50] I agree, but I feel uneasy without fingers on Hasid.
[10572.06 → 10573.46] Two trackball mice?
[10573.50 → 10574.46] That one's for me.
[10574.78 → 10576.06] It's common in the studio world.
[10576.08 → 10581.34] Because you can do cords and have like 700 different shortcuts and just do this.
[10582.02 → 10585.58] Yeah, see, my ADD would prevent me from remembering any of those shortcuts.
[10586.12 → 10587.40] That's the reason why I don't use them either.
[10588.40 → 10588.80] Nice.
[10588.80 → 10595.98] I have an external number pad that goes on the right side of my mouse pad.
[10596.86 → 10598.60] So I have a 10 keyless keyboard.
[10598.72 → 10599.62] That's not even weird anymore.
[10600.30 → 10601.18] Is that not weird anymore?
[10601.24 → 10601.50] Nah.
[10602.46 → 10602.74] Oh.
[10602.74 → 10604.58] Yeah, that's just like...
[10604.58 → 10607.58] I guess I can be a hipster about it now then.
[10607.70 → 10608.18] I guess.
[10608.50 → 10609.90] Yeah, I did it before it was cool.
[10610.18 → 10610.78] I did though.
[10611.00 → 10612.60] Any odd PC habits?
[10614.24 → 10615.60] Odd PC habits.
[10617.36 → 10617.98] I don't know.
[10618.04 → 10618.78] I'm kind of Norrie.
[10619.46 → 10620.20] I'm trying to think.
[10620.20 → 10623.58] You should.
[10625.46 → 10627.12] But you don't have more than one screen.
[10628.64 → 10629.74] Okay, I guess so.
[10629.84 → 10631.52] Yeah, I only have one monitor.
[10632.78 → 10635.42] With your computer setup, I think that's genuinely odd.
[10636.08 → 10645.70] I think I would be very surprised if there was like many other people that have that level of a computer setup with one screen.
[10646.06 → 10646.78] But I'm focused.
[10647.78 → 10648.46] I'm gaming.
[10650.02 → 10650.72] I mean, I have...
[10650.72 → 10652.22] Oh no, I do only have one screen at work.
[10652.70 → 10653.48] But it's huge.
[10653.56 → 10654.50] It's 42 inches.
[10655.26 → 10656.02] It's like...
[10656.02 → 10659.12] It's four freaking 21-inch displays.
[10659.70 → 10660.66] And that's how I use it.
[10660.70 → 10661.48] I use it in quadrants.
[10662.64 → 10663.42] And I use it...
[10663.42 → 10664.28] So it's a 4K display.
[10664.28 → 10665.48] I use it at 100% scaling.
[10665.58 → 10666.64] I have four monitors, Luke.
[10666.82 → 10669.78] I think whatever habits we would have wouldn't feel weird to us.
[10669.82 → 10671.24] I think someone else would have to observe them.
[10671.44 → 10671.82] I don't know.
[10671.98 → 10672.96] Because I don't feel like I do.
[10673.12 → 10674.28] Yeah, I don't feel that weird.
[10676.12 → 10676.36] Okay.
[10677.14 → 10677.88] Okay, moving on.
[10678.10 → 10679.88] This is from Humberto.
[10680.18 → 10682.50] I'm interested in picking up a workshop jacket.
[10682.70 → 10685.52] Are there any places you wouldn't recommend it be worn?
[10685.72 → 10688.10] I'm a hobbyist woodworker, welder, and mechanic.
[10688.32 → 10690.72] And I would hate to trash it in two months or so.
[10690.88 → 10692.28] Well, we were just talking about dating.
[10692.46 → 10693.32] So maybe not to bed.
[10693.32 → 10694.24] Yeah.
[10694.90 → 10696.40] Yeah, I'm not on a date, probably.
[10696.58 → 10696.76] Yeah.
[10697.04 → 10701.86] I mean, unless you guys are going somewhere and you're doing metal art class.
[10702.04 → 10702.58] That's fun.
[10702.66 → 10703.52] That's a cool first date.
[10703.66 → 10704.10] Bring two.
[10706.62 → 10706.98] Shameless.
[10706.98 → 10709.74] I wouldn't wear it in the shower.
[10710.62 → 10711.02] Yeah.
[10711.16 → 10711.24] Good.
[10712.02 → 10712.76] Yeah, I don't know.
[10712.82 → 10713.12] I don't know.
[10713.24 → 10715.28] If you can trash it in two months, I'll give you a new one.
[10715.36 → 10716.74] So like, I wouldn't worry about it.
[10717.68 → 10718.04] Dang.
[10718.04 → 10720.48] I wouldn't wear it somewhere super hot.
[10721.00 → 10721.66] Trust him, bro.
[10721.74 → 10724.32] I was outside wearing one of those bushwhacking.
[10724.50 → 10726.90] And it's like, she's heavy, you know?
[10726.98 → 10727.26] Yeah.
[10727.50 → 10727.70] Yeah.
[10727.70 → 10727.78] Yeah.
[10727.78 → 10728.18] Yeah.
[10730.30 → 10731.26] Oh, don't.
[10731.70 → 10732.90] This one's anonymous.
[10732.90 → 10739.72] Hi, I recently got an internship at NASA with the team that drives the Perseverance Mars rover.
[10740.00 → 10740.20] Awesome.
[10740.32 → 10741.04] Oh my gosh, it's so exciting.
[10741.44 → 10748.20] That made me think, what some technology that makes you hopeful about our future like space exploration does for me?
[10748.66 → 10749.54] Almost nothing.
[10750.82 → 10753.74] For me, pretty much nothing except for space exploration.
[10754.18 → 10759.62] Almost all technological advancement has gone in the exact direction I had hoped it would not.
[10760.44 → 10764.42] There was a lot of stuff I was like, man, the future's going to be so cool when you have these things.
[10764.56 → 10767.42] And then you realize that those things are not profitable.
[10767.42 → 10769.58] The most profitable things.
[10769.70 → 10770.98] And then you're like, oh, wait.
[10771.60 → 10775.08] Technological advancement only really goes in the direction of profit.
[10775.08 → 10780.72] And then you're like, oh, wait, the future's going to be kind of boring in a lot of ways.
[10781.86 → 10784.10] It's all about like removing human element.
[10784.38 → 10786.58] I'd love to see recycling tech get a lot better.
[10787.22 → 10790.50] And there's a lot of work being done, which is good.
[10790.66 → 10792.36] But there could be a lot more.
[10793.06 → 10793.26] Yeah.
[10795.66 → 10796.76] This one's from Brian.
[10797.12 → 10800.22] Apple has a history of shifting the technological landscape.
[10800.68 → 10804.02] Will they be successful with their rumoured AR slash VR hardware?
[10804.02 → 10807.92] Without having seen it, it's impossible for me to say, but I really doubt it.
[10809.24 → 10810.82] I don't know.
[10810.94 → 10813.68] And maybe that's just me being just tired.
[10813.96 → 10820.84] You know, I'm tired of people saying like, this time, you know, Google Glass, Oculus, Galaxy.
[10821.14 → 10823.16] But like, I just, no, I don't know.
[10824.24 → 10826.32] It's probably going to kind of suck.
[10826.76 → 10828.66] It'll probably be as good as it can be.
[10828.66 → 10831.02] But I just don't see it.
[10831.42 → 10831.94] Phone.
[10832.48 → 10832.76] Yeah.
[10832.96 → 10833.38] Watch.
[10833.72 → 10834.02] Yeah.
[10835.32 → 10835.92] Glasses.
[10836.90 → 10842.08] It's only going to be glasses once it's essentially indistinguishable from normal glasses.
[10842.24 → 10843.64] We're so far away from that.
[10843.64 → 10844.68] And perfect.
[10844.76 → 10845.56] If ever.
[10845.84 → 10847.38] If we ever get there.
[10847.54 → 10848.24] It'd be really tough.
[10848.24 → 10851.50] Hey, this one's from Drake.
[10851.86 → 10858.14] Hey, Linus, as employers, how do you and Yvonne decide how much to budget for things with no direct return on investment?
[10858.54 → 10861.34] I.e. coffee, snacks for employees, Christmas parties, etc.
[10863.60 → 10864.72] The Christmas party.
[10865.60 → 10867.14] I wouldn't talk about that one.
[10867.14 → 10867.36] Yeah.
[10867.46 → 10869.52] Christmas party is just like, it's f***, man.
[10870.80 → 10871.20] Snacks.
[10871.40 → 10873.04] We go through a lot of snacks.
[10873.04 → 10877.56] I don't even, I can tell you right now, I have no idea how much we spend on snacks.
[10877.68 → 10878.34] There isn't a budget.
[10880.12 → 10882.30] We buy a reasonable quantity of snacks.
[10882.44 → 10882.74] Do you?
[10882.90 → 10883.10] Okay.
[10883.26 → 10887.78] And I guess you guys trust that we're not going to spend $1,000 a week.
[10888.10 → 10888.94] I mean, do you?
[10889.36 → 10890.14] Actually, probably.
[10890.48 → 10890.74] Okay.
[10890.86 → 10891.34] Well, I don't know.
[10891.82 → 10893.02] It's the first time hearing of it.
[10893.24 → 10895.22] It's snacking for 100 people.
[10895.96 → 10897.96] I never get any.
[10898.36 → 10899.84] Nobody ever brings me snacks.
[10900.02 → 10900.50] I don't get any.
[10900.78 → 10901.90] Deliver them to my home.
[10901.90 → 10904.58] Don't take that as an actual instruction.
[10904.64 → 10906.06] I don't even know where the snacks are.
[10906.52 → 10907.42] I know where they are, actually.
[10907.48 → 10908.26] But I've never had any.
[10908.34 → 10908.76] They're over there.
[10908.84 → 10909.44] You walk by them.
[10909.44 → 10909.94] I want snacks.
[10909.98 → 10910.40] You walk out.
[10910.86 → 10911.24] No, no, no.
[10911.24 → 10911.96] Those are the extras.
[10911.98 → 10912.30] No, forget it.
[10912.58 → 10913.80] You're not allowed those snacks.
[10913.86 → 10914.48] I'm getting snacks.
[10914.58 → 10916.24] They're in the writer's kitchen.
[10916.26 → 10917.16] He's the CEO, brush.
[10917.58 → 10918.86] Don't take my snacks.
[10919.14 → 10920.70] He's going to eat all my snacks.
[10921.54 → 10922.68] Yeah, there's a shelf.
[10923.06 → 10925.08] I think we buy different ones occasionally.
[10925.66 → 10926.76] Kind of rotate through them.
[10927.94 → 10929.66] I believe Ariana's in charge of that now.
[10929.66 → 10930.34] Some of them are healthy.
[10930.52 → 10930.76] Some of them are not.
[10930.76 → 10932.40] Malakand dropped something off at my house.
[10932.46 → 10933.64] I don't remember what it was.
[10935.26 → 10937.04] I needed it for some reason.
[10937.12 → 10937.82] Cheeto puffs?
[10938.14 → 10939.16] What is this shit?
[10939.76 → 10940.74] I don't think those are.
[10940.88 → 10941.80] Cheeto puffs are lame.
[10941.90 → 10943.36] I don't think those are approved snacks.
[10943.70 → 10944.28] Yeah, they're not.
[10944.38 → 10945.10] Cheeto puffs suck.
[10945.36 → 10948.24] You want the like, dense ones, not the puffy ones.
[10948.76 → 10949.50] Or the crunchy ones.
[10949.50 → 10952.44] But yeah, Malakand was dropping something off.
[10952.50 → 10953.32] I don't remember what it was.
[10956.00 → 10957.30] Go XLR, maybe?
[10957.30 → 10957.62] Really?
[10957.82 → 10958.88] Cheeto puffs?
[10959.10 → 10960.44] Want the crunchy ones?
[10960.62 → 10960.86] See?
[10961.16 → 10963.40] I don't think those are snacks we buy.
[10963.92 → 10965.50] It's more like granola bars.
[10966.50 → 10968.22] And he brought me some granola bars.
[10968.38 → 10969.42] And I was like, that's cool.
[10969.42 → 10971.96] Is he coming back?
[10973.16 → 10974.28] I don't think so.
[10974.44 → 10976.00] I think he's going to eat all the snacks.
[10976.24 → 10978.00] He is within his right to.
[10978.42 → 10981.12] Should we get a poll going for puffs versus crunchy?
[10981.92 → 10982.32] Sure.
[10982.66 → 10983.78] Do you need me to do that?
[10983.84 → 10985.00] I don't remember.
[10985.14 → 10985.38] Okay.
[10985.48 → 10985.78] Probably.
[10986.26 → 10987.00] It doesn't matter.
[10987.12 → 10989.02] Let's pick a question that I can answer.
[10989.14 → 10990.70] And while I answer the question, I'll do the poll.
[10990.70 → 10991.14] Okay.
[10992.34 → 10993.68] This one's probably easy for you.
[10993.94 → 10994.02] Sure.
[10994.30 → 10999.38] Luke, what does the last day before a week plus vacation look like for you?
[10999.64 → 11000.20] Oh, God.
[11000.94 → 11002.86] It doesn't sound like it's a nice day.
[11004.76 → 11006.74] Vacations are like basically an illusion.
[11008.86 → 11013.30] I took vacation time because I had my wisdom teeth taken out.
[11013.70 → 11015.58] And I am still recovering.
[11016.60 → 11018.36] Not from the wisdom teeth being taken out.
[11018.36 → 11019.66] From the vacation time.
[11019.66 → 11025.68] Uh, because the amount of backlog that I have of tasks that just piled up.
[11027.20 → 11031.32] A horrifyingly demolished email inbox.
[11031.56 → 11035.42] Uh, lots of other different various things that I'm supposed to catch up on.
[11035.46 → 11036.72] Like it's the work.
[11037.54 → 11040.26] Doesn't just like to go away for me.
[11040.26 → 11043.12] Cause my, the stuff that I do is not redundant.
[11043.40 → 11044.68] There's no one else that does it.
[11045.28 → 11048.26] Um, so that kind of sucks.
[11048.70 → 11049.16] Um.
[11049.66 → 11057.14] For Linus, it's probably very frantically, um, hosting lots of videos.
[11057.14 → 11060.44] So they, they build a bit of a backlog before he takes off.
[11061.36 → 11061.76] Um.
[11063.12 → 11063.52] But.
[11063.98 → 11064.30] Yeah.
[11065.42 → 11067.30] Oh, someone made the poll instead of me.
[11067.36 → 11067.78] Thank you.
[11067.88 → 11068.40] It was me.
[11068.62 → 11069.36] Oh, good job.
[11069.74 → 11070.08] Puff?
[11070.30 → 11072.52] Not puff, obviously, because I'm not a heathen.
[11072.68 → 11074.82] He has found the snacks.
[11074.82 → 11079.78] I appreciate that you dislike puffy Cheetos.
[11080.60 → 11081.04] I don't think we buy.
[11081.04 → 11081.86] It's not that I dislike them.
[11081.96 → 11082.72] It's that they shouldn't exist.
[11082.86 → 11083.16] Yes.
[11083.38 → 11083.68] Agreed.
[11083.68 → 11084.20] I think we buy them.
[11085.02 → 11085.82] Uh, yeah.
[11085.90 → 11087.40] So each department gets their own snacks.
[11087.76 → 11088.08] Editors.
[11088.36 → 11088.62] Writers.
[11089.68 → 11090.84] The editors don't get enough.
[11090.92 → 11093.28] There's like only like three granola bars in their entire thing.
[11093.84 → 11094.24] Yeah.
[11094.46 → 11095.50] So we should make sure they get more.
[11095.98 → 11096.42] Make a note.
[11096.42 → 11099.44] I mean, yeah, they're, they're, it's not my department.
[11099.52 → 11100.36] That shouldn't be his job.
[11100.44 → 11100.58] Yeah.
[11100.70 → 11100.88] Yeah.
[11100.88 → 11102.68] They, they have an ongoing order.
[11102.90 → 11103.14] Yeah.
[11103.26 → 11104.66] We're almost out of Red Bull as well.
[11105.80 → 11106.16] Okay.
[11106.28 → 11109.92] I will, I will scream at probably Ariana.
[11110.06 → 11110.90] I think that's her job now.
[11111.14 → 11111.32] What?
[11111.48 → 11112.44] No, that can't be her job.
[11112.44 → 11113.22] That shouldn't be her job.
[11113.32 → 11114.40] I don't remember.
[11114.64 → 11116.32] She has too many other things going on.
[11116.32 → 11116.44] Yeah, no, she.
[11116.58 → 11117.92] Oh, we'll just make Vance do it.
[11118.16 → 11118.56] Um.
[11118.86 → 11119.12] What?
[11119.36 → 11119.72] Linus.
[11119.74 → 11120.50] Probably not his job either.
[11120.50 → 11121.72] Yeah, I don't think that's his job either.
[11121.90 → 11122.42] It's logistics.
[11122.64 → 11122.84] Okay.
[11123.36 → 11126.40] Can you just email Colton and make sure that it is being done?
[11126.42 → 11127.94] By someone that actually makes any sense?
[11128.18 → 11128.96] I'll, I'll deal with it.
[11129.00 → 11129.88] It's totally fine.
[11130.08 → 11130.48] Thank you.
[11130.74 → 11131.96] I shouldn't have upset you.
[11132.38 → 11132.74] Um.
[11132.84 → 11134.80] Not puffs one by a lot and that's good.
[11135.18 → 11136.14] Yeah, they're, they're nice.
[11136.80 → 11137.82] What if you mix them together?
[11138.50 → 11139.22] You know, a big bowl.
[11139.64 → 11140.60] Non-puffy gang.
[11142.02 → 11142.30] Uh.
[11142.54 → 11146.66] Linus, uh, Luke was answering what the last day before a vacation looks like.
[11148.02 → 11148.94] How about you?
[11149.90 → 11150.70] Both of you.
[11150.72 → 11151.68] A really long day.
[11151.88 → 11152.14] Yeah.
[11152.56 → 11154.16] We both answered very negatively.
[11154.16 → 11157.42] So stressful.
[11157.42 → 11158.44] It's kind of horrible, actually.
[11158.44 → 11161.58] The last day before I go and the first day back both suck.
[11162.10 → 11166.24] I was, I was saying while you were gone that I'm still recovering from my vacation.
[11166.38 → 11170.88] I was saying I'm not, I'm done recovering from my teeth sockets, but I'm still recovering
[11170.88 → 11174.96] from the vacation because there's just, there's so much to claw back on.
[11175.34 → 11177.14] Like, it's just, oh my goodness.
[11177.14 → 11178.40] And then new things are coming in.
[11178.46 → 11184.64] So it's like, bah, you don't want to leave the new stuff, but then you have to claw back
[11184.64 → 11185.40] on the old stuff.
[11185.40 → 11187.48] So like, oh my goodness, it's hard.
[11187.48 → 11191.16] And then you just end up working a bunch of overtime, and then it's like, why did we do
[11191.16 → 11192.98] this at all in the first place?
[11193.40 → 11194.10] I don't know.
[11194.26 → 11194.52] Whatever.
[11195.06 → 11195.46] Um.
[11196.36 → 11196.82] Moving on.
[11196.88 → 11197.32] Next question.
[11198.28 → 11199.52] We're just into potentials now.
[11199.72 → 11201.06] Do you want me to start reading off some of them?
[11202.04 → 11202.36] Sure.
[11202.46 → 11202.78] Hit me.
[11203.36 → 11203.72] Okay.
[11204.02 → 11204.44] Uh.
[11204.52 → 11205.68] Linus is a Fold user.
[11206.02 → 11208.44] Do you have any expectations for the Z Fold 4?
[11209.46 → 11210.08] It's already out.
[11211.02 → 11211.36] Okay.
[11211.36 → 11211.96] Uh.
[11213.16 → 11215.76] To Linus is a fan of older Final Fantasy games, I think.
[11215.90 → 11216.90] And Takanashi.
[11217.82 → 11218.30] Uh.
[11218.60 → 11219.04] I am.
[11219.76 → 11220.40] It's gone.
[11220.52 → 11220.72] Uh.
[11220.76 → 11223.38] I'm happy to always hear you mention FF6.
[11223.58 → 11225.46] Have you started playing Fantasia?
[11225.88 → 11226.32] Fantasia.
[11227.30 → 11227.74] Fantasia.
[11228.22 → 11228.52] Dan.
[11228.64 → 11229.24] If so.
[11229.54 → 11230.28] What are your thoughts?
[11230.40 → 11232.86] And have you ever gotten a chance to play FF9?
[11233.40 → 11233.64] Uh.
[11233.66 → 11233.82] Yeah.
[11234.00 → 11235.20] Final Fantasy IX is amazing.
[11235.46 → 11235.70] Uh.
[11235.70 → 11236.94] One of the best in the series.
[11237.04 → 11237.98] At least out of what I've played.
[11238.06 → 11241.02] I haven't played garbage ones that are not 6 or 9.
[11241.02 → 11241.34] No.
[11241.44 → 11242.00] I'm kidding.
[11242.06 → 11242.94] I have played some other ones.
[11243.12 → 11243.22] But.
[11244.00 → 11246.32] I haven't played many of the more modern ones.
[11246.88 → 11247.08] Uh.
[11247.24 → 11250.60] Final Fantasy IX was such a return to form after 7 and 8.
[11251.18 → 11251.90] Such a good game.
[11252.38 → 11252.76] Um.
[11254.80 → 11255.22] Yes.
[11255.36 → 11256.24] I have started Fantasia.
[11256.36 → 11258.10] I'm about 14, 15 hours in.
[11258.54 → 11258.86] So.
[11259.08 → 11259.54] It's good.
[11259.82 → 11262.62] I wouldn't describe the female characters as progressive.
[11263.50 → 11263.90] Um.
[11264.28 → 11266.84] It's very traditional in good ways.
[11266.90 → 11271.00] And it's also very traditional in ways that I feel like gaming has sort of moved past.
[11271.02 → 11271.64] Like the.
[11272.04 → 11272.44] The.
[11272.50 → 11272.66] The.
[11272.66 → 11272.80] The.
[11272.80 → 11273.00] The.
[11273.02 → 11273.12] The.
[11273.12 → 11273.22] The.
[11273.72 → 11273.88] The.
[11273.94 → 11274.24] The.
[11274.24 → 11274.32] The.
[11274.32 → 11274.52] The.
[11274.56 → 11274.70] The.
[11274.70 → 11274.86] The.
[11274.86 → 11275.20] The.
[11275.20 → 11275.44] The.
[11275.44 → 11275.80] The.
[11275.80 → 11279.50] Hoe struck princess for like the brooding bad boy protagonist who treats her like crap
[11279.50 → 11280.28] is sort of a.
[11280.72 → 11281.30] Little tired.
[11281.62 → 11281.78] Yeah.
[11281.92 → 11282.12] It's a.
[11282.16 → 11282.36] It's.
[11282.40 → 11284.92] It's a trope that I don't really think needs to make a comeback.
[11284.92 → 11287.70] and it's there at least as far as I've gotten.
[11288.90 → 11292.80] And so pretty much everything else though,
[11292.90 → 11293.86] the beautiful environments,
[11294.14 → 11295.46] the way they've done the combat system,
[11295.68 → 11299.80] like being able to just like to walk around and explore
[11299.80 → 11302.72] and then it just queues up like a giant battle
[11302.72 → 11304.86] and you just fight all the low level baddies at once.
[11304.86 → 11309.28] It's like, oh, oh, I don't even mind like random battles
[11309.28 → 11311.54] because it'll just be like sent monsters
[11311.54 → 11313.38] to your little dimension.
[11313.38 → 11316.00] Yeah, really enjoying it so far though.
[11316.26 → 11316.52] Cool.
[11317.82 → 11318.74] Hi, Luke and Linus.
[11318.84 → 11320.78] As a woman in computer science,
[11320.82 → 11323.72] it's kind of depressing to see so few women involved
[11323.72 → 11326.16] slash included in the popular tech sphere.
[11326.62 → 11330.40] Is there a reason there haven't been many women knowledgeable
[11330.40 → 11332.26] in tech features and videos?
[11332.82 → 11334.80] We don't feature many people.
[11334.80 → 11338.24] Yeah, we don't really feature people for the most part.
[11338.52 → 11339.80] Yeah, kind of our own bubble.
[11340.38 → 11342.54] Yeah, it's, man, it's tough.
[11343.38 → 11347.10] I mean, I'm happy to,
[11347.28 → 11349.24] I'm happy to say that tentatively,
[11349.24 → 11353.26] I'm hoping there will be at least one female creator at LTX.
[11354.00 → 11356.20] Well, confirmations are starting to roll in,
[11356.28 → 11357.80] but I haven't actually checked with anyone
[11357.80 → 11359.68] that it's cool to say they're going to be there.
[11359.74 → 11361.02] So I'm not going to name anybody,
[11361.02 → 11366.58] but one female creator is hopefully going to be there.
[11366.58 → 11369.86] Yeah, it's not like they don't exist.
[11369.94 → 11372.78] And they exist in very hardcore technical spheres as well.
[11373.74 → 11375.66] There's just not many.
[11375.66 → 11379.88] And it's like, it's one of those things where I'm kind of sitting here going,
[11380.00 → 11380.80] well, okay.
[11381.42 → 11383.38] On the one hand, like, I,
[11384.12 → 11387.56] what am I supposed to do?
[11388.16 → 11388.56] Right?
[11388.64 → 11392.96] Like, I can't, I can't conjure women in the tech sphere.
[11392.96 → 11396.88] Um, and I also, like, I'm, I'm not gonna,
[11396.98 → 11400.82] I'm not going to pretend they like need my help or whatever.
[11400.82 → 11405.34] Like, I'm not going to mansplain or whatever being in the tech sphere.
[11405.34 → 11407.74] Like, I, I don't know.
[11408.68 → 11411.00] I know Shannon Morse has been,
[11411.46 → 11414.58] uh, if, if you ever watched like Threat wire,
[11414.72 → 11416.54] Hack 5 back in the day or anything like that,
[11416.62 → 11418.24] she's, she's been around forever.
[11418.24 → 11418.32] Yeah.
[11419.28 → 11419.64] Um.
[11419.92 → 11420.34] Awesome content.
[11420.96 → 11421.34] I don't know.
[11421.38 → 11422.44] It's, it's, it's tough.
[11422.48 → 11424.38] Like we can only hire people who apply.
[11424.68 → 11424.92] Yeah.
[11425.00 → 11426.78] Like people are pointing out, well, what about your bubble?
[11427.10 → 11428.00] Like, shouldn't you just,
[11428.88 → 11430.00] Chris would be nice for content.
[11430.08 → 11430.20] Yeah.
[11430.20 → 11431.72] But like, call me Chris does her own thing.
[11431.76 → 11433.70] And let me tell you, she ain't technical.
[11435.58 → 11436.10] That's fine.
[11436.10 → 11438.90] I consider her a friend and I tell her that to her face,
[11439.00 → 11441.78] but there's a reason that she needed me to come put together a computer.
[11442.60 → 11444.70] Like, so that's the thing.
[11445.02 → 11445.76] I, I, I don't know.
[11446.58 → 11446.94] Yeah.
[11447.08 → 11447.68] I don't know.
[11447.68 → 11451.12] We, we, yeah, we can, we can only hire people who apply.
[11454.24 → 11454.68] Okay.
[11454.84 → 11456.64] Um, don't normally catch you alive.
[11457.22 → 11459.02] Linus is a martial artist.
[11459.36 → 11460.00] I'm curious.
[11460.20 → 11464.30] Uh, why have you taken a step back from training yourself and focusing on helping teach?
[11464.48 → 11467.86] I've always found that the best teachers are the ones that are training and improving.
[11468.44 → 11469.18] Get called out.
[11469.70 → 11472.46] Uh, well, I didn't take a step back from training myself.
[11472.46 → 11478.42] I took a gigantic leap, colossal leap back from training myself.
[11478.42 → 11484.16] I hadn't done any training in 18 years when I set foot in my daughter's class to help out.
[11484.42 → 11491.62] Uh, it's because the reason, the only reason I'm doing it is to help make them more enthusiastic about their training.
[11491.62 → 11493.04] I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm being a dad.
[11493.04 → 11497.22] I'm not, I'm not trying to like to get to competitive form or anything like that.
[11497.56 → 11498.66] Uh, I enjoyed it.
[11498.66 → 11502.76] But the things, the main benefits for me from martial arts, like I'm not, I'm not going to compete.
[11502.90 → 11506.58] I'm not going to, um, I have other things that I do to stay in shape.
[11506.86 → 11513.82] Um, the main benefits for me are things like, you know, knowing how to fall safely and stuff like that, which I, which I know.
[11513.82 → 11516.76] And I don't need to go, I don't need to really go practice.
[11517.40 → 11527.26] Um, yeah, I, I mean, to be clear, I actually have done more training since I like have talked about it.
[11527.26 → 11532.14] So I booked a two-hour private with the, uh, the, the master of their dojo.
[11532.54 → 11540.56] And we basically ran through everything from like white belt up to like blue, like, like full blue curriculum.
[11541.38 → 11545.00] Um, and then I got, I have it all on video so that I can go and review.
[11545.00 → 11548.90] And that's, um, that'll be really helpful for me when I'm like helping out the young kids.
[11548.90 → 11552.00] But you got to understand, like, I'm just helping out in basic classes.
[11552.00 → 11555.92] I'm, I'm showing newcomers things like how to make a fist properly, right?
[11555.92 → 11559.02] Like I'm, I, I, yeah, I remember it.
[11559.04 → 11560.00] I remember it pretty well.
[11560.08 → 11560.92] It's, it's pretty okay.
[11561.24 → 11561.34] Yeah.
[11561.34 → 11567.54] I was going to say, I think teaching is a step forward if anything, because it was completely out of it.
[11569.46 → 11569.90] Okay.
[11569.90 → 11574.62] This one's from Andrew, a long time watcher and fan.
[11574.62 → 11578.56] It has been his experience of his own watching the channel grow over the past 10 years.
[11579.00 → 11580.58] Time flies over the years.
[11580.68 → 11585.02] What are some positive ways your employees have impacted your professional and personal growth?
[11585.92 → 11586.76] Telling me when I'm wrong.
[11587.86 → 11597.32] I mean, that's, that's the biggest one is just like helping, helping keep our, our guiding star where it should be.
[11597.92 → 11601.16] Um, and I think everyone here deserves a ton of credit for that.
[11603.60 → 11604.28] No, they don't.
[11605.36 → 11607.90] Um, telling you, you're wrong.
[11608.20 → 11609.22] Uh, this is from Haley.
[11609.64 → 11613.08] Hey, Linus, take my physical riding test for a motorcycle in a month.
[11613.08 → 11613.32] Woo.
[11613.76 → 11615.70] How nervous were you to take your test?
[11616.10 → 11619.94] Would you have any tips for someone who has a little over 70 hours under my belt?
[11620.06 → 11627.42] Well, um, one tip would be that you have so much more riding experience than I did when I did my test that there's no excuse for failing.
[11627.42 → 11627.98] If you do yourself.
[11627.98 → 11628.16] Yeah.
[11628.40 → 11628.92] No, I'm just kidding.
[11628.98 → 11629.20] I'm kidding.
[11629.26 → 11629.44] I'm kidding.
[11629.84 → 11631.28] Um, yeah, that's really great.
[11631.28 → 11633.08] You've done a perfect job of preparing yourself.
[11633.30 → 11644.56] Uh, I will say that I wasn't particularly nervous about the test itself because by the time I did my riding test, I had like 10 years of driving experience almost.
[11644.96 → 11645.90] No, not.
[11646.64 → 11647.62] Maybe eight years.
[11647.70 → 11647.96] I don't know.
[11648.02 → 11649.18] I had a lot of driving experience.
[11649.24 → 11650.04] I drove a lot.
[11650.04 → 11654.60] So however long I'd been driving, I had done a lot of driving in that time.
[11655.00 → 11656.66] Uh, so it's the same road here.
[11656.74 → 11659.22] Anyway, it's the same road test for a motorcycle or a car.
[11659.44 → 11662.30] So I had already done my car road test and drove a lot.
[11662.38 → 11663.90] So I just had to do it on a bike.
[11664.00 → 11667.44] The thing that made me nervous was that the only place I could get an appointment was Richmond.
[11667.44 → 11675.72] And there's got to be something in the water because driving in Richmond is terrifying.
[11676.40 → 11689.24] Um, just pretty little regard for things like, man, I almost got, I almost got hit like three weeks ago because fortunately I'm a super defensive driver slash defensive rider.
[11689.24 → 11694.80] So I am always head on a swivel, assuming that every other car on the road is a complete idiot.
[11695.16 → 11696.40] Like that's how I drive.
[11696.40 → 11697.88] So good way to go.
[11698.16 → 11701.60] I was turning left, and a car was turning right into two lanes.
[11701.60 → 11709.12] Now we should both maintain lane position, and we should both be able to go at the same time because I am a defensive driver.
[11709.52 → 11710.60] I didn't go.
[11710.80 → 11711.50] Yeah, you never trust that.
[11711.66 → 11714.62] I, I, I slowed down a little bit without looking.
[11714.70 → 11717.00] They went straight into my lane.
[11717.08 → 11718.76] Would have just hit me.
[11718.94 → 11720.54] Would have just nailed me.
[11721.14 → 11726.00] Um, only time I've ever had to use my e-brake.
[11726.00 → 11731.76] As anything other than a parking brake was, yeah, driving an NCI back in the day.
[11731.76 → 11739.36] Man, the, uh, the, the pillar in the parking garage at Aberdeen Mall is covered in so many different colours of luxury car paint.
[11739.44 → 11739.78] Oh yeah.
[11741.26 → 11741.70] Yep.
[11741.70 → 11744.74] I once, I once saw someone hit it.
[11744.74 → 11747.22] Like they took the turn too tight, and they hit it.
[11747.22 → 11750.30] And instead of backing up and like going around.
[11750.42 → 11751.34] Did they like to push through?
[11751.60 → 11753.96] They just floored it.
[11754.12 → 11754.40] Oh.
[11754.40 → 11760.56] So instead of one panel being damaged, it was basically the entire side of the car.
[11761.12 → 11761.48] Oh.
[11761.56 → 11763.34] I couldn't believe my eyes.
[11763.50 → 11765.98] I just, I've never seen anything like it before or since.
[11767.16 → 11767.76] That's wild.
[11768.02 → 11768.56] I don't know.
[11770.32 → 11771.70] I got this one from John.
[11772.08 → 11773.30] Hi Linus, Luke and Dan.
[11773.40 → 11773.90] Two questions.
[11773.90 → 11777.18] I am in human computer interaction course.
[11777.52 → 11777.80] HCI.
[11779.00 → 11781.98] Are there any interfaces you use that make you frustrated?
[11782.26 → 11786.54] Just brought a Stream Deck and have you considered doing a long-term review or a revisit?
[11787.92 → 11788.92] But, uh, yeah.
[11789.18 → 11792.00] Uh, no, probably not going to revisit the Steam Deck anytime soon.
[11792.06 → 11796.74] We'll take a look at where the software has gotten to once like a Steam Deck 2 launches or something like that.
[11796.74 → 11800.46] Uh, we did take a look at the, uh, new accessory, the dock, the Deck dock.
[11801.10 → 11809.60] Um, and yeah, other than that, I don't think the experience has changed much other than just generally getting better and better and better and better and better.
[11809.70 → 11811.80] There's, I wouldn't have much else to say at this point.
[11812.48 → 11819.06] As for interfaces that make me frustrated, I mean, I'd have a hard time finding an interface that doesn't make me frustrated at times.
[11820.10 → 11822.72] That's probably pretty, pretty normal.
[11824.04 → 11824.70] Study hard.
[11824.92 → 11825.78] Do great work.
[11825.98 → 11826.10] Yeah.
[11826.10 → 11826.72] Good luck.
[11826.74 → 11827.34] We need you.
[11828.58 → 11829.82] This one's from Colin.
[11830.22 → 11842.02] Linus re-watched the original Task video, and while I can relate to the frustrations of customer support policies, I found the way you treated a support rep with no control over the policy cringeworthy.
[11842.26 → 11844.02] Was there any debate over including that?
[11844.72 → 11846.06] Uh, no, it was included.
[11846.16 → 11848.04] I never looked at the video before it was published.
[11848.34 → 11851.22] Um, frankly, I mean, I didn't swear.
[11851.36 → 11852.22] I didn't insult them.
[11852.22 → 11856.72] Um, I was extremely frustrated.
[11856.74 → 11857.94] I made it very clear.
[11857.94 → 11860.08] I will never go straight for that card.
[11860.08 → 11863.64] But I got to tell you, um, I don't make the rules about what works.
[11864.38 → 11870.00] And unfortunately, from my experience, that's the way to get escalated to someone higher up.
[11870.00 → 11872.24] And that sucks.
[11872.34 → 11874.48] Uh, people should just help you immediately.
[11874.48 → 11881.38] But a lot of places that I've interacted with have policies where unless you get mad, you just don't get any help.
[11882.10 → 11884.30] So I was, I was pulling a lever.
[11884.84 → 11887.84] Um, I was very much in control when I was talking to them.
[11887.96 → 11891.64] So like I said, you know, I'm not going to personally attack them or anything like that.
[11891.64 → 11896.72] Because obviously they, um, I know absolutely nothing about them.
[11896.72 → 11907.34] But what I will tell you is that something that that individual did do that did rub me the wrong way was they basically, you know, used the textbook.
[11907.34 → 11911.98] Um, I, I don't, I don't like a script being used on me.
[11912.76 → 11916.46] Um, unfortunately is not, is not fortune.
[11916.46 → 11918.80] That is a that is a decision that was made.
[11918.86 → 11919.68] That's not fortune.
[11919.78 → 11920.46] That's not chance.
[11920.50 → 11921.10] It's not luck.
[11921.44 → 11922.94] Uh, it's not lucky or unlucky.
[11922.94 → 11924.38] It's a decision that was made.
[11924.38 → 11924.56] They might have to.
[11925.18 → 11929.70] And so when you basically stonewall and go, no, you can't talk to anyone else.
[11930.28 → 11932.20] So A, I can't do anything for you.
[11932.20 → 11934.68] And B, no, you can't talk to anyone who can.
[11936.24 → 11939.74] Well, yeah, you're going to get some venting because you can do that.
[11939.88 → 11941.06] You choose not to.
[11941.52 → 11944.16] And ultimately when I did speak to someone, guess what?
[11944.46 → 11946.78] The policy was stupid, and the policy got changed.
[11946.78 → 11955.94] So maybe if instead of stonewalling customers, however many times that has happened, that feedback was passed along, we would be in a different situation by the time I had to call.
[11956.46 → 11958.84] So yeah, I guess I just don't buy it.
[11958.96 → 11967.66] Um, on the one hand, yeah, I understand that frontline support workers get a lot of, uh, get a lot of grief.
[11968.88 → 11976.70] But at the end of the day, as a customer, they are literally the only means you have of getting a message to anyone behind them.
[11977.74 → 11979.40] So what are you supposed to do?
[11979.88 → 11985.50] Not express frustration with a phenomenally stupid policy that makes absolutely no sense?
[11988.24 → 11988.88] I don't know.
[11989.02 → 11989.52] It's tough.
[11991.40 → 11992.18] Yeah, it's tough.
[11992.38 → 11992.60] I guess.
[11992.60 → 11999.12] I always try to add in like, I know this isn't on you, but I am pissed.
[12000.48 → 12000.88] Yeah.
[12003.00 → 12003.40] Okay.
[12003.52 → 12005.64] On a bit of a lighter note, this is from Justin.
[12005.64 → 12009.02] Do you plan to add any more Lego decor around your house?
[12009.16 → 12014.40] I thought the flowers were an awesome idea and might look perfect with an Imperial Star Destroyer.
[12014.84 → 12015.36] Uh, Luke.
[12015.44 → 12015.92] Let's go.
[12016.54 → 12018.36] Do you have any Lego decor?
[12019.20 → 12020.44] Uh, some actually.
[12020.58 → 12020.86] Yeah.
[12021.20 → 12027.82] My, I, I don't, I think actually not originally inspired by you guys because I don't think she had seen them yet.
[12027.96 → 12028.22] Right.
[12028.22 → 12033.48] Uh, but my girlfriend is like recently obsessed with Lego and has gotten a lot of the similar things.
[12033.56 → 12033.94] That's awesome.
[12034.06 → 12035.82] Like the little plants and flowers and stuff.
[12035.96 → 12036.60] Plenty time.
[12037.18 → 12037.40] Yeah.
[12037.94 → 12039.92] Um, we have the piano.
[12039.92 → 12041.56] I'm sure my wife will buy more stuff.
[12041.66 → 12042.02] I don't know.
[12043.08 → 12043.96] Got one here from Nathan.
[12044.52 → 12049.52] What is a device or item that you almost always buy cheaply or isn't worth buying expensive?
[12050.04 → 12051.38] This is a company purchase.
[12051.68 → 12052.94] He's bought a couple of screwdrivers.
[12053.12 → 12053.58] Oh, nice.
[12053.58 → 12057.34] We design, install custom solar slash battery slash inverter systems.
[12057.34 → 12057.56] Nice.
[12057.64 → 12059.12] With a focus on specialty vehicles.
[12059.42 → 12059.56] Cool.
[12059.60 → 12061.90] Bought my driver in and now buying some for our shop.
[12062.02 → 12062.70] Oh, that's awesome.
[12062.98 → 12063.22] Sweet.
[12063.72 → 12065.38] A device that I cheap out on.
[12066.10 → 12067.04] Is it device?
[12067.28 → 12067.52] Yeah.
[12067.66 → 12068.22] Or item.
[12068.60 → 12068.76] Yeah.
[12068.82 → 12070.18] Just something I cheap out on.
[12072.42 → 12073.62] Snacks for around the office?
[12073.96 → 12077.78] I, I never buy fancy, I never buy fancy water cooling coolant.
[12078.96 → 12079.40] Okay.
[12079.50 → 12079.64] Yeah.
[12079.70 → 12082.96] I always just use tap water with some biocide in it because I just don't care.
[12083.30 → 12085.10] Our tap water is decently good.
[12085.26 → 12087.46] Like we don't have really hard tap water.
[12087.64 → 12088.70] So, eh.
[12091.92 → 12092.84] Anything for you, Luke?
[12092.84 → 12094.62] I mean, you just don't buy anything ever.
[12094.76 → 12094.92] Yeah.
[12095.10 → 12095.68] I don't know.
[12096.10 → 12097.38] It's not 100% true.
[12097.56 → 12098.38] He doesn't buy clothing.
[12098.98 → 12099.34] Free.
[12100.44 → 12103.02] I, you guys don't, oh, you have shorts now.
[12103.02 → 12103.72] But it's good.
[12104.20 → 12105.14] It's good clothing.
[12105.62 → 12106.92] You don't have socks yet.
[12108.60 → 12109.00] Those aren't cheap.
[12109.00 → 12110.10] Why don't the socks coming?
[12111.08 → 12111.48] Okay.
[12111.58 → 12112.38] This one's from Eli.
[12112.80 → 12117.48] Hi, Luke and Linus here from America thinking our capitalistic healthcare system sucks too.
[12117.94 → 12122.06] I'm wondering what your thoughts on our, I wonder what your thoughts,
[12122.06 → 12125.66] on video game cheating where it's widely accepted.
[12125.84 → 12127.86] Like 2b2t in Minecraft.
[12127.86 → 12128.82] That's a different situation.
[12129.08 → 12130.70] I don't even know what 2b2t is.
[12131.42 → 12134.58] It's like a lawless Minecraft server as far as my understanding goes.
[12135.06 → 12135.40] Is that right?
[12135.42 → 12136.00] Oh, well, yeah.
[12136.06 → 12137.60] As long as everyone understands.
[12137.84 → 12137.94] Yeah.
[12138.00 → 12138.88] Then it doesn't matter.
[12138.98 → 12139.68] It's not even cheating.
[12139.78 → 12141.50] It's just engaging in a variety of ways.
[12141.58 → 12141.78] Yeah.
[12141.78 → 12142.42] That's fine.
[12142.42 → 12147.28] That's like, it's the exact same caveat that I threw in where I was like, we're talking
[12147.28 → 12148.44] about multiplayer games.
[12148.74 → 12151.80] You know, this is, sure, it's a multiplayer game, but it's accepted.
[12152.04 → 12153.02] So like, who cares?
[12153.56 → 12153.78] Yeah.
[12153.78 → 12155.64] It's only when it's deceptive that it's a problem.
[12155.90 → 12156.12] Yeah.
[12156.24 → 12159.34] If I start cheating playing a game with my friends, you know, yeah.
[12159.98 → 12160.66] It's fun.
[12161.10 → 12161.98] Or if it's allowed.
[12161.98 → 12165.40] But this one here's from Nicholas.
[12165.78 → 12169.62] Hey, Luke and Linus, any product launches that performed way better than expected and
[12169.62 → 12171.34] any that were the exact opposite?
[12172.00 → 12172.86] Thank you very much.
[12173.10 → 12173.56] Love the show.
[12174.98 → 12175.72] Oh, man.
[12175.80 → 12177.96] You guys are asking really hard questions tonight.
[12178.12 → 12179.62] Either that or my brain is just dumb.
[12180.02 → 12180.18] Yeah.
[12180.22 → 12181.14] There's also a lot of them.
[12181.26 → 12184.36] All the questions tonight were so good, which is why I had to do so many.
[12185.16 → 12186.28] Man, this is tough.
[12186.44 → 12187.72] You're going to know this a lot better than me.
[12187.98 → 12190.08] I think more people should buy the ABCs of gaming.
[12191.98 → 12194.92] It has five stars.
[12195.64 → 12195.88] Okay?
[12197.96 → 12199.50] More people should buy this.
[12199.72 → 12200.54] Yeah, it's a book.
[12200.62 → 12201.32] It's adorable.
[12202.32 → 12203.92] Exactly what you pay for.
[12204.16 → 12204.98] A board book.
[12205.38 → 12205.68] Okay?
[12206.62 → 12208.82] Also, my infant loves it.
[12209.34 → 12209.58] Okay?
[12210.86 → 12212.44] Oh, they didn't get the pre-bonus items.
[12212.58 → 12214.50] Well, you got to contact support.
[12214.86 → 12215.06] Yeah.
[12215.18 → 12215.56] What do you...
[12215.56 → 12217.14] Don't...
[12217.14 → 12217.42] Ugh.
[12218.22 → 12219.96] Everyone loved that.
[12220.22 → 12220.44] Okay?
[12220.54 → 12221.96] Start of a nursery collection.
[12222.14 → 12222.68] Let's go.
[12222.86 → 12223.60] Five stars.
[12223.86 → 12224.46] Five stars.
[12224.76 → 12225.66] Five stars.
[12226.60 → 12228.18] Everyone should buy the ABCs of gaming.
[12228.60 → 12230.78] To be clear, we've sold tens of thousands of copies.
[12230.96 → 12232.88] So I don't know what to tell you, but it's...
[12233.80 → 12235.46] More people should have it.
[12236.24 → 12241.44] The question is technically phrased than expected, not than you expected, which I know
[12241.44 → 12241.98] still applies.
[12242.04 → 12242.74] Don't worry about it.
[12243.40 → 12245.84] But I'm going to take this as other people.
[12245.84 → 12251.76] I think the screwdriver and the backpack both outperformed what external people expected.
[12252.32 → 12253.00] Oh, yeah, probably.
[12253.08 → 12254.70] But I was reasonably confident.
[12254.84 → 12255.22] Oh, for sure.
[12255.22 → 12258.54] I mean, I was stressed because it was like such a huge gamble, but...
[12258.54 → 12258.72] Yeah.
[12260.08 → 12262.06] The screwdriver performed better than I expected.
[12262.06 → 12266.64] Because of our wave system, you could actually tell like exactly how many we had sold.
[12267.18 → 12269.76] I got a lot of messages of people being like, whoa.
[12270.78 → 12273.28] It's like, yeah, we're a screwdriver company now.
[12273.90 → 12274.22] Boy!
[12274.76 → 12275.44] I know, right?
[12276.10 → 12276.64] Hilarious.
[12277.62 → 12278.96] This one's from Eric.
[12279.40 → 12283.30] Recent smartphone releases have been iterative slash boring.
[12283.30 → 12289.24] Are there any new features on the horizon that could get you excited for new phones?
[12291.50 → 12291.90] No?
[12292.16 → 12292.38] Nope.
[12292.70 → 12294.54] They could bring back SD cards.
[12294.90 → 12297.76] It would be bringing back old features that they've got rid of.
[12297.88 → 12297.96] Yeah.
[12297.96 → 12300.80] There's more than just SD card, in my opinion, but there are a few different things.
[12300.90 → 12300.98] Yeah.
[12301.06 → 12302.40] I mean, I'm pretty into foldable.
[12302.72 → 12303.88] He's not, but I am.
[12304.08 → 12304.82] I think it's pretty cool.
[12305.00 → 12305.74] IR blaster.
[12306.04 → 12306.84] Your screen's gross.
[12307.18 → 12308.44] All the foldable screens are gross.
[12309.16 → 12310.00] This one's from Tim.
[12310.24 → 12310.68] Last one.
[12310.68 → 12317.14] I'm sad my old, witty, think-geek shirts are wearing away to rags, and I have no way
[12317.14 → 12317.80] to replace them.
[12318.18 → 12324.34] Since TG is effectively dead, could you consider imitating or seeking a license to reprint them?
[12325.36 → 12326.20] I don't think so.
[12326.30 → 12328.14] I like the style that we're aiming for.
[12328.26 → 12333.24] I like the mostly subtle, yeah.
[12333.54 → 12334.48] This one's not that subtle.
[12335.50 → 12337.16] Yeah, but it's like engineering diagram.
[12337.16 → 12337.60] I don't know.
[12337.66 → 12339.44] It's very unoffensive.
[12340.68 → 12341.68] Yeah.
[12342.64 → 12343.58] That's all I got for you.
[12344.84 → 12345.58] That's it.
[12345.72 → 12346.32] That's it.
[12346.42 → 12346.68] Okay.
[12346.86 → 12351.00] Well, I'm text replying to them feverishly here from the incoming messages.
[12351.14 → 12351.90] There's 26.
[12352.56 → 12358.14] We must have had a good launch today because a lot of people were like, yes, I will part
[12358.14 → 12363.58] with my money in order to have that new product that you guys launched.
[12365.82 → 12366.62] Hey, guys.
[12366.72 → 12367.84] Been watching for a long time.
[12368.60 → 12369.36] Yeah, anyway.
[12369.42 → 12370.58] I was going to rapid fire these.
[12370.84 → 12380.06] The LTT store is in USD only because it simplifies pricing and calculation of margins and all of
[12380.06 → 12383.28] that because all of our costs are in US dollars pretty much.
[12383.46 → 12384.88] Not all, but mostly.
[12385.54 → 12389.66] So we might as well just set our price in US dollars.
[12391.24 → 12392.40] Oh, what's happening to these?
[12392.60 → 12393.88] Some of them are getting archived.
[12393.88 → 12394.66] Oh, are they?
[12394.80 → 12395.02] Okay.
[12397.82 → 12398.30] Yes.
[12398.70 → 12402.20] Investor demands for returns are terrible and will hurt innovation.
[12402.52 → 12403.26] Yeah, Mark C.
[12403.42 → 12404.24] It's bad.
[12404.86 → 12405.32] It's bad.
[12406.14 → 12406.54] Todd.
[12407.04 → 12407.74] First time buyer.
[12407.94 → 12408.46] You all are streaming.
[12408.58 → 12408.96] Hey, hi.
[12409.04 → 12409.82] Love everything and have a go.
[12409.84 → 12410.16] Okay.
[12410.50 → 12410.92] Show.
[12411.22 → 12411.46] Okay.
[12411.50 → 12411.76] Perfect.
[12412.04 → 12413.08] We're going through these together.
[12413.22 → 12413.54] Oh, no.
[12413.62 → 12414.08] Let's go.
[12414.34 → 12415.32] People are duplicating actions.
[12415.32 → 12418.66] Instead of making boring fixed screwdrivers, have you considered a series of handles with
[12418.66 → 12419.76] interchangeable shafts?
[12419.88 → 12420.82] We've considered it.
[12420.94 → 12422.50] We are not going to do it.
[12422.58 → 12424.76] And the reason for that is that you would add slop.
[12425.18 → 12427.08] And we don't really want to do that.
[12428.36 → 12431.34] Elon overtly uses bots to fluff of comments.
[12431.46 → 12432.98] His social media posts automatically.
[12434.06 → 12436.58] Do you feel that he had early access to ChatGPT type AI?
[12436.74 → 12437.22] I mean, I don't know.
[12437.84 → 12438.58] Overtly uses?
[12438.82 → 12439.08] Yeah.
[12439.22 → 12440.72] I don't think he uses it on purpose.
[12441.22 → 12442.32] I think that's...
[12444.22 → 12444.54] Yeah.
[12444.54 → 12448.12] When you ran your Thunderbolt cable through your wall, did you find a way to do it without
[12448.12 → 12449.88] having the cable stick out of a wall plate?
[12450.48 → 12450.72] No.
[12450.80 → 12452.10] There's no Thunderbolt keystone.
[12452.18 → 12452.88] You won't find that.
[12452.98 → 12453.20] Sorry.
[12454.80 → 12455.80] Rewatch the original Jessica.
[12455.92 → 12456.00] Oh.
[12456.20 → 12456.34] Yep.
[12456.52 → 12456.68] Nope.
[12456.94 → 12457.30] Archive.
[12457.40 → 12458.56] We just talked about that one.
[12458.74 → 12458.96] Okay.
[12458.98 → 12459.74] There's only nine left.
[12460.14 → 12461.58] These are all rejected.
[12462.02 → 12462.38] Yeah.
[12462.74 → 12463.14] Go for it.
[12463.22 → 12463.54] They are?
[12464.12 → 12464.34] Yeah.
[12464.50 → 12464.90] I thought...
[12464.90 → 12465.28] Bottom right.
[12465.52 → 12466.48] All rejected.
[12467.34 → 12467.74] Rejected?
[12468.20 → 12468.54] What?
[12469.06 → 12470.72] These are the potential ones that were rejected.
[12472.58 → 12472.94] What?
[12473.32 → 12473.52] Really?
[12473.52 → 12473.76] I don't know.
[12473.76 → 12474.94] Read them if you want.
[12474.98 → 12477.30] But we talked about the computer human interaction one.
[12477.38 → 12477.90] Hi, Luke.
[12478.14 → 12478.80] Says Anonymous.
[12479.10 → 12479.54] Perfect.
[12481.62 → 12483.86] With the challenge over, have you gone back to 7900 XTX?
[12483.98 → 12484.22] Yes.
[12485.30 → 12486.64] Well, that's the next challenge.
[12486.86 → 12487.06] Yeah.
[12487.14 → 12487.88] I'm replying.
[12488.38 → 12488.72] Okay.
[12488.76 → 12489.50] We did this one.
[12489.64 → 12490.16] Archive.
[12490.58 → 12490.90] Okay.
[12490.90 → 12492.86] Why are you guys adding potential rejected?
[12492.96 → 12494.18] We should just archive them?
[12494.36 → 12494.76] I don't know.
[12494.86 → 12495.72] Why'd they go back to incoming?
[12495.72 → 12497.94] They get pulled back into incoming for...
[12497.94 → 12499.04] I think it should be archived.
[12499.12 → 12500.00] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12500.06 → 12500.44] I remember.
[12500.50 → 12500.84] I remember.
[12501.12 → 12501.96] Conrad explained this.
[12502.24 → 12504.84] Because if you just archive it, it doesn't show it.
[12505.30 → 12505.50] Yeah.
[12505.50 → 12508.26] So it needs to pop back out so you can decide what to do with it.
[12508.28 → 12510.12] Either reply to it, show it, or archive it, whatever.
[12510.12 → 12510.14] Okay.
[12510.14 → 12510.88] This is user error.
[12511.22 → 12511.86] Sorry, Conrad.
[12512.28 → 12512.68] Nice.
[12513.50 → 12513.90] Nice.
[12513.90 → 12514.54] It's an intelligent system.
[12514.54 → 12518.46] My black shaft screwdriver was stolen from me this week.
[12519.74 → 12523.32] Do you have a plan to release something to secure it to your pocket or belt instead of having it loose?
[12523.40 → 12523.66] Yes.
[12524.16 → 12526.52] I want to do a holster.
[12528.28 → 12530.68] Like a cringe dad holster.
[12530.68 → 12531.52] Would it secure it, though?
[12531.58 → 12532.32] Because that's what...
[12532.32 → 12532.54] Yeah.
[12532.82 → 12534.52] With, like, snaps.
[12535.64 → 12535.94] Yeah.
[12537.62 → 12538.38] Oh, boy.
[12538.54 → 12539.48] That's what I want to do.
[12540.56 → 12541.02] Yes.
[12541.28 → 12542.42] We have a plan.
[12543.10 → 12543.40] All right.
[12543.40 → 12543.96] That's it.
[12544.06 → 12544.50] That's all.
[12544.62 → 12545.30] See you again next week.
[12545.30 → 12546.36] Same BAD time, SAME BAD channel!
[12548.14 → 12550.14] Bye!
[12550.22 → 12552.22] Bye!
[12552.80 → 12554.82] Bye!
[12555.28 → 12555.58] Bye!
[12562.62 → 12567.12] Bye!
[12567.14 → 12569.40] Bye!
