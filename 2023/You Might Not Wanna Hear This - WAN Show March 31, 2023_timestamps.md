[2023-04-05T22:10:29Z] Video: You Might Not Wanna Hear This - WAN Show March 31, 2023 
Without timestamps being available I would not watch the show at all, because much less than 50% of topics and questions interest me - and I value my time

[2023-04-02T23:24:31Z] Video: You Might Not Wanna Hear This - WAN Show March 31, 2023 
the WAN show... *sigh* I love listening to your takes on the news, but it's becoming almost unwatchable without timestamps... 4Â½ hour show and 90 minutes of content.

[2023-04-02T19:24:24Z] Video: You Might Not Wanna Hear This - WAN Show March 31, 2023 
One of the greatest points about E3 (in my opinion) Is the central element of it. You get a timestamp and you know who to expect there. Now you only have multiple events and livestreams by individual studios that you miss most of the time that are spread out the entire year

[2023-04-02T14:00:34Z] Video: You Might Not Wanna Hear This - WAN Show March 31, 2023 
4 hours and a half and no fucking timestamps - Great idea ğŸ˜‚

I think its time you guys did something to reign in the length of these, as well as have someone on staff do timestamps so that they're reliably there. Trying to sift through 4 and a half hours of footage to find the bits I care about is a bit much.

LTT take FAR too long to do timestamps :(

The show now is basically stroking your products begging for money + "the life of Linus the Great (and Luke sometimes)". 
Your topics took like half an hour + 10 minutes + 10 minutes or something like that - when the timestamps will be available - I'll calculate the % of the wan show that IS ACTUALLY wan show, I bet it is less than 25%.
How to compete with LTT? Just freaking do the freaking wan show with actual topics and actual analysis, and not this BS! If you do that well - you'll get your audience fast!
I used to like the wan show, but those ridiculous 3-4 hour streams of self-stroking are just bad... I used to wait for Friday to watch the wan show to find something new - not now... Sitting for 4 hours well past midnight is dumb!
1.5 hours with actual topics seems to be a reasonable time frame.

1:44:18 Guys... don't associate with Grammarly. It suuuuucks. The example you provide at the timestamp indicated illustrates clearly Grammarly's propensity to suggest phrasing _which is incorrect, grammatically._

The wording:

"We can only move forward if we're on the same page."

...means, specifically, that if [they] are on the same page _all that they can do is move forward_. Which is to say that they can't breathe, can't think, can't eat, can't drink, can't [insert any random activity (which isn't: moving forward) here].

A better parsing of the sentence is, for example:

"We can move forward only if we're on the same page."

Sorry but it took me way too long to post the timestamps, so i'll be reposting. Thanks to @NoKi1119 for doing the time stamps. You are amazing. 
I was promised a "3 hour WAN Show" in pre-show, Lienus! I demand retribution!!1

I'm not going to watch a 4h30m long video guys. LTT should have a timestamp guy. Don't you employ like fifty thousand million people? Just ask someone to do timestamps. Stop relying on the community.

we need timestamps, I can't just watch 4 hours or skip around hoping I land on a topic I'm interested in. sheeeeesh. love u tho.
