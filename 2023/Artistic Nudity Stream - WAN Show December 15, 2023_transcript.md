[0.00 --> 3.24]  What is up everybody and welcome to the WAN Show!
[3.24 --> 6.24]  We've got a great show for you guys this week, of course!
[6.24 --> 10.88]  The big news is the big change in Twitch's terms of service.
[10.88 --> 17.00]  Naturally, since we do stream on Twitch, this is going to have a big impact on the WAN Show where finally...
[19.50 --> 22.88]  We're gonna be able to do all the things we've always wanted to do!
[22.88 --> 25.88]  We've got fuzzy handcuffs, we've got...
[25.88 --> 30.34]  silicone nipple covers. I really don't know what this had to do with anything.
[30.34 --> 34.30]  But we've also got other more different nipple covers!
[34.30 --> 36.30]  Oh yeah!
[36.30 --> 38.30]  Also, today...
[38.30 --> 40.76]  I don't know what else is...
[40.76 --> 42.76]  How do you transition off that?
[42.76 --> 45.18]  Epic finally won something!
[45.18 --> 53.68]  That's right! A jury has sided with Epic in their lawsuit against Google, agreeing that Google used anti-competitive business practices.
[53.68 --> 57.14]  We'll be talking a little bit about that and what else we got? Did I manage to pick your two again?
[57.14 --> 58.14]  Ah, you did.
[58.14 --> 59.64]  Go Linus!
[59.64 --> 65.64]  AMD says overclocking is still okay, despite saying that overclocking is not okay.
[67.06 --> 68.26]  Yeah, it's complicated.
[68.26 --> 68.84]  It's weird.
[68.84 --> 71.34]  It's actually very complicated. I don't understand it.
[71.34 --> 74.22]  I would be confused if I was trying to do that.
[74.22 --> 77.38]  Also, you can't check who's monetized on YouTube anymore.
[78.10 --> 79.56]  Yeah...
[79.56 --> 82.02]  So, on the surface...
[82.02 --> 83.02]  Which is weird.
[83.02 --> 91.52]  I can kind of see how maybe that's not that big of a deal, but the deeper you go, the more insidious it appears to be.
[91.52 --> 93.52]  Bleh!
[93.52 --> 95.48]  Bleh!
[95.48 --> 95.98]  Bleh!
[112.98 --> 116.98]  The show is brought to you by iFixit, Signal Wire, and V1 Tech. Wow.
[116.98 --> 119.44]  I wasn't fast enough to actually get the things.
[119.44 --> 121.44]  You look like you're bringing medical supplies.
[121.44 --> 124.44]  Do you want the silicone covers or do you want the X's?
[124.44 --> 125.44]  Either is an option.
[125.44 --> 126.44]  Wow.
[126.44 --> 128.32]  I didn't know we were actually doing this.
[128.32 --> 129.44]  I don't care, I think.
[129.44 --> 130.94]  Do you want a rock-paper-scissors or something?
[130.94 --> 131.44]  Sure, yeah.
[131.44 --> 132.44]  We could rock-paper-scissors.
[132.44 --> 135.44]  Is there a more like lewd version of rock-paper-scissors?
[135.44 --> 137.90]  I mean, you could have...
[137.90 --> 141.90]  It's a little early in the show to...
[141.90 --> 145.90]  You could have, what, penises, vaginas, and...
[145.90 --> 147.52]  Wow, none of that was censored.
[148.08 --> 149.62]  He did not press the button.
[149.72 --> 150.62]  Those aren't bad words.
[150.70 --> 151.58]  Those are body parts.
[151.58 --> 151.90]  That is technically true.
[151.90 --> 152.90]  There's nothing wrong with them.
[152.90 --> 153.02]  That is technically true.
[153.26 --> 153.50]  Yep.
[153.50 --> 155.50]  Okay, so, uh...
[157.50 --> 161.26]  Don't worry, we're gonna talk about the aspects of it that Twitch has rolled back.
[161.26 --> 162.96]  We're gonna get into it, but first...
[162.96 --> 163.46]  Oh, my.
[163.46 --> 165.66]  We need to choose what we're going to be wearing.
[165.66 --> 166.16]  Yeah.
[166.16 --> 167.50]  Okay, rock-paper-scissors.
[167.50 --> 169.50]  Let's just stick with rocks, papers, and scissors.
[169.50 --> 170.50]  Which one are we going for?
[170.50 --> 172.30]  Uh, yeah, you gotta decide.
[172.30 --> 173.80]  Which one do you get if you win?
[173.80 --> 174.80]  I don't...
[174.80 --> 175.80]  Dan, choose.
[176.80 --> 177.30]  Uh...
[177.30 --> 178.00]  I'm gonna get Switch.
[178.00 --> 180.80]  If Luke wins, he gets the silicone.
[180.80 --> 181.30]  Okay.
[181.30 --> 181.80]  Okay.
[181.80 --> 182.30]  Okay.
[182.30 --> 182.80]  Okay.
[183.50 --> 185.20]  What?
[185.20 --> 185.80]  Uh...
[185.80 --> 186.80]  Rock-paper-scissors shoot?
[186.80 --> 187.80]  I went on two.
[187.80 --> 188.80]  What is your...
[188.80 --> 189.80]  I mean, technically I won.
[189.80 --> 190.80]  Nah.
[190.80 --> 191.80]  Nah.
[191.80 --> 193.80]  I mean, I'm pretty sure the people all saw that I just won.
[193.80 --> 194.80]  I did.
[194.80 --> 195.80]  Okay, that doesn't...
[195.80 --> 196.80]  Okay, so rock-paper-scissors shoot?
[196.80 --> 197.80]  Yeah, yeah.
[197.80 --> 198.80]  Okay.
[198.80 --> 199.80]  Rock-paper-scissors...
[199.80 --> 200.80]  Huh.
[200.80 --> 201.80]  Alright, I guess I won.
[201.80 --> 202.80]  So, which one...
[202.80 --> 204.80]  Sorry, I don't remember what I was fighting for.
[204.80 --> 205.80]  I don't remember.
[205.80 --> 206.80]  Uh...
[206.80 --> 208.80]  So, you get the X's then, I think?
[208.80 --> 209.80]  Alright.
[209.80 --> 210.80]  Because if Luke won, he got the silicone.
[210.80 --> 211.80]  Okay.
[211.80 --> 214.10]  Wait.
[214.10 --> 216.10]  So then Luke gets the same thing regardless of the outcome?
[216.10 --> 217.10]  Oh, no, sorry.
[217.10 --> 218.10]  I'm not sure if I follow...
[218.10 --> 220.10]  I don't think he saw who won.
[220.10 --> 222.10]  I think he just guessed.
[222.10 --> 225.10]  So, then Linus, you get the silicone.
[225.10 --> 226.40]  Oh, you get the silicone.
[226.40 --> 227.40]  Oh, I get the silicone.
[227.40 --> 229.40]  Sorry, I forgot the rule that I set five seconds earlier.
[229.40 --> 231.40]  Wow, 100% silicone.
[231.40 --> 232.40]  Very cool.
[232.40 --> 233.40]  Does it actually, like, stick on?
[233.40 --> 234.40]  Is it adhesive?
[234.40 --> 236.40]  I have no idea, Luke.
[236.40 --> 238.40]  Does this look like the kind of thing I've used before?
[238.40 --> 242.40]  Don't answer that on this show.
[242.40 --> 244.40]  I wonder if they look good, like, over your eyes.
[244.40 --> 250.70]  No, that's like some nightmare fuel right there.
[250.70 --> 251.70]  Just...
[251.70 --> 252.70]  Go to Linus.
[252.70 --> 253.70]  Hello!
[253.70 --> 254.70]  Eyeless man.
[254.70 --> 258.70]  Look at you, some type of, like, bee or something.
[258.70 --> 263.20]  This great Bernie in float plane chat says it looks like a chicken fillet.
[263.20 --> 265.00]  We're doing it?
[265.00 --> 266.00]  Yeah, I mean...
[266.00 --> 267.00]  Okay, okay.
[267.00 --> 268.00]  We're not even covering anything.
[268.00 --> 269.00]  It's not lewd.
[269.00 --> 270.00]  What do you put...
[270.00 --> 271.00]  Are you at...
[271.00 --> 273.00]  Oh, you're just putting on your shirt.
[273.00 --> 274.00]  Okay.
[274.00 --> 275.00]  Yeah, whatever.
[275.00 --> 276.00]  It's not a big deal.
[276.00 --> 277.00]  I don't know.
[277.00 --> 280.00]  Sometimes it's hard to tell how far you're wanting to go with something.
[280.00 --> 285.00]  That's why we have safe words.
[285.00 --> 291.30]  Does HR watch the man show?
[291.30 --> 293.30]  I was talking to Nikolai about that.
[293.30 --> 294.30]  Apparently not.
[294.30 --> 295.30]  Okay.
[295.30 --> 296.30]  Well, that's probably a good thing.
[296.30 --> 298.30]  We both decided the same.
[298.30 --> 299.30]  Yeah.
[299.30 --> 300.30]  Okay.
[300.30 --> 301.30]  Oh, man.
[301.30 --> 302.30]  All right.
[302.30 --> 308.30]  So, while he's working on that, Twitch allows then bans the drawing of...
[308.30 --> 310.30]  Broobs.
[310.30 --> 314.30]  If I say a word that's not even a word, then no one can get mad at me for it.
[314.30 --> 315.30]  You can get mad at me for it, right?
[315.30 --> 316.30]  Yeah.
[316.30 --> 317.30]  Um...
[317.30 --> 319.30]  Wow, there's lots of sources for this.
[319.30 --> 325.14]  But two days ago, Twitch adjusted its terms of service to allow artistic depictions of
[325.14 --> 331.30]  nudity, such as drawings or sculptures of breasts, buttocks, and genitalia as long as
[331.30 --> 334.18]  the content was correctly labeled.
[334.18 --> 337.00]  Depictions of sex acts were still excluded.
[337.00 --> 343.60]  Twitch likewise broadened its policy to allow content that deliberately highlights breasts,
[343.60 --> 350.60]  buttocks, or the pelvic region, including body writing and body paint on breasts and buttocks.
[350.60 --> 351.60]  Wow.
[351.60 --> 354.60]  Nudity, however, was still prohibited.
[354.60 --> 361.80]  Today, Twitch reversed the new policy following a massive wave because who could have seen this
[361.80 --> 370.80]  coming of lewd art that fell both within and outside of the policy's new scope.
[370.80 --> 373.80]  Twitch stated, and this is a quote,
[373.80 --> 377.80]  much of the content created has been met with community concern.
[377.80 --> 380.80]  These are concerns we share.
[380.80 --> 384.80]  Upon reflection, we have decided that we went too far with this change.
[384.80 --> 388.80]  Digital depictions of nudity present a unique challenge.
[388.80 --> 393.80]  AI can be used to create realistic images, and it can be hard to distinguish between digital
[393.80 --> 395.80]  art and photography.
[395.80 --> 398.80]  I don't even think that's the biggest of the issues, but sure.
[398.80 --> 405.80]  The change was an apparent response to the banning of OnlyFans model MorgPi following a viral, topless stream.
[405.80 --> 413.80]  While she certainly appeared to be topless, her chest was not fully visible, leading to a debate over whether she had, in fact, broken the rules.
[413.80 --> 419.80]  And our discussion question here is, should there be a greater tolerance for non-sexual nudity on Twitch?
[419.80 --> 420.80]  Why can't there be?
[420.80 --> 430.80]  That's an interesting topic of discussion, but there's something more important that I want to address, and that is, is that really where your nipples are?
[430.80 --> 431.80]  Uh, yeah.
[431.80 --> 432.80]  No, I'm just kidding.
[432.80 --> 434.80]  That's a perfectly good place for them.
[434.80 --> 435.80]  You're doing great.
[435.80 --> 436.80]  Good job.
[436.80 --> 437.80]  Okay.
[437.80 --> 438.80]  Sorry.
[438.80 --> 445.80]  Okay, what I want to talk about is, what was the actual motivation for this change?
[445.80 --> 448.80]  Is your dad dying in the background?
[448.80 --> 454.80]  These people pay my bills?
[454.80 --> 457.80]  Okay, sorry, what's up?
[457.80 --> 458.80]  What was the, uh...
[458.80 --> 460.80]  Yeah, what I want to talk about is, what was...
[460.80 --> 461.80]  Let's speculate.
[461.80 --> 462.80]  Let's play the speculation game.
[462.80 --> 463.80]  Yeah.
[463.80 --> 465.80]  What was the actual reason for this change?
[465.80 --> 466.80]  Oh.
[466.80 --> 481.80]  Because, on the surface, it looks like it was as simple as, OnlyFans is making a ton of money from people just throwing dollars at their screens, um, and then taking a cut of it.
[481.80 --> 484.80]  And that seems like something that we'd love to participate in.
[484.80 --> 491.80]  I mean, I guess it's kind of a natural broadening of Twitch's, of Twitch's content scope.
[491.80 --> 492.80]  I mean, you'd get...
[492.80 --> 495.80]  Which they've sort of done before with, like, the hot tubs channels and stuff.
[495.80 --> 496.80]  Yeah.
[496.80 --> 497.80]  Well, I don't even just mean that.
[497.80 --> 498.80]  We could go back farther than that.
[498.80 --> 499.80]  Categories.
[499.80 --> 502.80]  You'd get laughed out of the room these days for saying, what are you doing streaming on Twitch?
[502.80 --> 503.80]  You're not even gaming.
[503.80 --> 504.80]  Yeah.
[504.80 --> 505.80]  Like, that used to be a thing.
[505.80 --> 506.80]  That was absolutely a thing.
[506.80 --> 510.80]  We used to get flack in the chat on WAN show with people saying...
[510.80 --> 511.80]  Because it was a talk show.
[511.80 --> 512.80]  There's no game on screen.
[512.80 --> 515.80]  You shouldn't even be streaming on Twitch against terms of service.
[515.80 --> 517.80]  Like, people were actually angry about it.
[517.80 --> 519.80]  You couldn't do 3D printing.
[519.80 --> 526.80]  And nowadays, pretty much anything goes within categories like just chatting and IRL.
[526.80 --> 533.80]  And so, it's not like they haven't dramatically broadened the type of content on the platform before.
[533.80 --> 540.80]  Maybe to them, did this just seem as simple as, I don't know, broadening the content again?
[540.80 --> 541.80]  As long as it's labeled clearly.
[541.80 --> 551.80]  What is the difference between this content being on Twitch TV versus this content being an 8 second Google search, assuming you're on dial-up.
[551.80 --> 552.80]  Often for the same user name.
[552.80 --> 553.80]  On some other site.
[553.80 --> 554.80]  Right.
[554.80 --> 555.80]  Exactly.
[555.80 --> 560.80]  And so, with that in mind, do you think it was that simple?
[560.80 --> 561.80]  I think that might be part of it.
[561.80 --> 563.80]  I think also there's like...
[563.80 --> 567.80]  I think Twitch suffers because there are...
[567.80 --> 574.80]  I think maybe their rules are like more defined.
[574.80 --> 579.80]  I haven't really compared, but it feels like their rules are more defined than other platforms.
[579.80 --> 584.80]  Because like, if you're gonna try to say YouTube doesn't have this stuff, you're nuts.
[584.80 --> 585.80]  Oh, 100%.
[585.80 --> 586.80]  It's all over YouTube.
[586.80 --> 587.80]  I have...
[587.80 --> 591.80]  But no one looks at YouTube and says like, oh, that's a website that has this stuff.
[591.80 --> 594.80]  That's not a consistent conversation.
[594.80 --> 604.80]  I have, not to the same degree as a platform like Twitter, but I have absolutely come across very lewd videos on YouTube completely by accident.
[604.80 --> 605.80]  One was...
[605.80 --> 609.80]  I mean, and sometimes it's not even in the ways that you would think.
[609.80 --> 610.80]  Twitter, it's like...
[610.80 --> 611.80]  Oh.
[611.80 --> 612.80]  Constant.
[612.80 --> 615.80]  If you have anything trending and you scroll and you're just like, oh, well, there's a but.
[615.80 --> 616.80]  Oh, wow.
[616.80 --> 617.80]  Yeah.
[617.80 --> 622.80]  Even if just some random tweet that isn't even on the trending section, but if it just gets a little bit too much traction, yeah, there you go.
[622.80 --> 629.80]  Yeah, you'll just get people promoting their OnlyFans or just posting pornography for no reason other than just because I guess they want to.
[629.80 --> 630.80]  Yeah.
[630.80 --> 636.80]  But, so it's not nearly to that degree, but you know, sometimes on YouTube it's not in the ways that you would expect.
[636.80 --> 646.80]  Like one of the times I saw what I thought was probably the most lewd thing I've come across on the platform, I think ever.
[646.80 --> 648.80]  I'm just trying to think.
[648.80 --> 650.80]  It was some kind of music video.
[650.80 --> 651.80]  Okay.
[651.80 --> 654.80]  And so it was kind of mainstream-ish.
[654.80 --> 655.80]  Yeah.
[655.80 --> 659.80]  But definitely too racy for you to ever see it on something like MTV.
[659.80 --> 668.80]  Like it not, you know, not only were there just breasts bouncing around, people dancing around, but like, you know, consuming shots off them.
[668.80 --> 669.80]  Yeah.
[669.80 --> 674.80]  So it's like to me that crosses way over from nudity into a sex act.
[674.80 --> 676.80]  Is that that song which the name starts with wet?
[676.80 --> 677.80]  I actually have no idea.
[677.80 --> 678.80]  Oh, okay.
[678.80 --> 679.80]  Yeah.
[679.80 --> 680.80]  Oh, the Nicki Minaj one?
[680.80 --> 681.80]  I don't know.
[681.80 --> 682.80]  Or is that Cardi B?
[682.80 --> 683.80]  Sorry.
[683.80 --> 684.80]  I don't remember.
[684.80 --> 685.80]  I don't know.
[685.80 --> 690.80]  All the young people cried out and then were suddenly silenced just now.
[690.80 --> 691.80]  I'm sorry.
[691.80 --> 693.80]  I don't know who these people are.
[693.80 --> 694.80]  Anyway, the point is no.
[694.80 --> 696.80]  No, it was some random.
[696.80 --> 697.80]  It was like obscure.
[697.80 --> 698.80]  Okay.
[698.80 --> 699.80]  Yeah.
[699.80 --> 700.80]  But yeah, that's like totally a thing.
[700.80 --> 701.80]  I've never seen it before.
[701.80 --> 702.80]  I've never seen it again.
[702.80 --> 704.80]  I just was like, seriously?
[704.80 --> 705.80]  This is on YouTube.
[705.80 --> 709.80]  So like when that's happening on YouTube, it's all over Twitter.
[709.80 --> 712.80]  I don't use it, but I'm assuming it's all over TikTok.
[712.80 --> 713.80]  I have no idea.
[713.80 --> 719.80]  Um, and, uh, I also don't go to this website, but I'm assuming this is a thing on kick.
[719.80 --> 726.80]  Like why do they have to have specific rules that are more, more aggressive than other platforms?
[726.80 --> 733.80]  Um, I, I think they're also, so they're, they're probably feeling like they have more pressure on them than other platforms to actually do something about it.
[733.80 --> 736.80]  I think that's because they talk about it more.
[736.80 --> 739.80]  I think YouTube and these other platforms just ignore it.
[739.80 --> 740.80]  Yeah.
[740.80 --> 745.80]  Well, it's not just that the Twitch community talks about it a lot because whether Twitch
[745.80 --> 746.80]  people try to push the lines more, I think.
[746.80 --> 765.80]  Whether Twitch, um, how much responsibility Twitch bears for this, I think is open for debate, but Twitch certainly is in the conversation around, you know, people streaming on the platform and cultivating an audience.
[765.80 --> 766.80]  Offboarding to only fans or whatever.
[766.80 --> 767.80]  Based on appearance.
[767.80 --> 773.80]  And even, well, even before only fans existed, the conversation around streamers on Twitch.
[773.80 --> 774.80]  Oh, I see.
[774.80 --> 775.80]  Attracting people through.
[775.80 --> 778.80]  Because of their appearance instead of their like gameplay or whatever.
[778.80 --> 779.80]  Or whatever.
[779.80 --> 780.80]  Yeah.
[780.80 --> 788.80]  I wonder if part of this conversation is just vestigial from when Twitch was supposed to be about gameplay and nothing else.
[788.80 --> 793.80]  And what are people doing on here not focused on the gameplay and it's, it's more about this.
[793.80 --> 811.80]  I think there's a relatively simple counter argument to that, that I've heard a bunch of times from a bunch of people, which is like, if someone is sitting here watching a certain piece of content because they want to look at someone that they think is attractive, that person is probably not going to come watch your game stream.
[811.80 --> 812.80]  Yeah.
[812.80 --> 813.80]  No, no, no, a hundred percent.
[813.80 --> 814.80]  It's a different audience member.
[814.80 --> 821.80]  Therefore, you're not losing anything from them looking at somebody else because they would have been looking at somebody else on some other platform anyways.
[821.80 --> 823.80]  So like, who cares?
[823.80 --> 826.80]  Um, I, I've heard that from quite a few different people.
[826.80 --> 828.80]  I think that holds a lot of water personally.
[828.80 --> 833.80]  Like, I don't know, like they're not, they're not coming here to watch you play League of Legends right now.
[833.80 --> 835.80]  They want to look at attractive person.
[835.80 --> 839.80]  Um, if they can't look at attractive person on Twitch, they'll go look at them somewhere else.
[839.80 --> 851.80]  Um, so I, um, I do also definitely see some of the arguments against, you know, if, if Twitch's position, let's say,
[851.80 --> 855.80]  is, you know, realistically, this is a, this is a quick Google search away.
[855.80 --> 860.80]  Uh, what difference does it make if it's a click or, you know, entering what, what is it?
[860.80 --> 862.80]  Nine, nine keystrokes.
[862.80 --> 868.80]  Um, but on the other hand, you know, I do kind of understand too.
[868.80 --> 873.80]  It's like, this is a site whose brand is, well, hold on.
[873.80 --> 874.80]  No, not that.
[874.80 --> 878.80]  I just, I clicked on a category on Twitch and was immediately assaulted.
[878.80 --> 881.80]  I, I, oh, okay.
[881.80 --> 883.80]  Why would you do that?
[883.80 --> 884.80]  Why would you do that?
[884.80 --> 885.80]  What's the category?
[885.80 --> 887.80]  Uh, just chatting.
[887.80 --> 888.80]  Alright.
[888.80 --> 890.80]  There was no blurred thumbnails.
[890.80 --> 891.80]  There was.
[891.80 --> 895.80]  The least they could do is wear these, okay?
[895.80 --> 897.80]  Well, they might be.
[897.80 --> 898.80]  That's true.
[898.80 --> 899.80]  They're below the frame.
[899.80 --> 900.80]  That's true.
[900.80 --> 901.80]  Like they're, they're actually not in frame.
[901.80 --> 902.80]  Ah.
[902.80 --> 903.80]  Um.
[903.80 --> 904.80]  Okay.
[904.80 --> 908.80]  Well, at any rate, so the, you're really undermining the point I'm trying to make here right
[908.80 --> 914.80]  now because I was going to say Twitch's brand on the face of it is more minor friendly.
[914.80 --> 916.80]  It's gaming and video gaming.
[916.80 --> 917.80]  I, yeah.
[917.80 --> 919.80]  But I guess here's the question.
[919.80 --> 923.80]  I mean, is gaming that minor friendly inherently anymore?
[923.80 --> 926.80]  Like I, I, I have, I haven't played the Witcher 3.
[926.80 --> 932.80]  I've only played the first half an hour and within the first, within the first half an hour,
[932.80 --> 935.80]  there's a lot of butts.
[935.80 --> 936.80]  Yeah.
[936.80 --> 937.80]  Um.
[937.80 --> 941.80]  Ballerscape 3 is like a very horny game.
[941.80 --> 944.80]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[944.80 --> 948.80]  Well, like I, it just is.
[948.80 --> 949.80]  I don't know.
[949.80 --> 950.80]  Um.
[950.80 --> 951.80]  Yeah.
[951.80 --> 952.80]  I don't know.
[952.80 --> 962.80]  I, I think Twitch had that reputation and I think that maybe some of that still stays
[962.80 --> 965.80]  just from people that don't use the platform too much.
[965.80 --> 968.80]  I think if you're like a Twitch person and you're on the platform all the time, you're
[968.80 --> 972.80]  aware that just chatting is like by far the biggest category and stuff like this happens
[972.80 --> 974.80]  all the time in that category.
[974.80 --> 977.80]  There's the like hot tubs category or whatever.
[977.80 --> 980.80]  They have a, they have a, all these other things.
[980.80 --> 987.80]  I just, I think they've, they've gone a little bit further than dipping their toe for a long time now.
[987.80 --> 989.80]  Yeah. So then here's the question then.
[989.80 --> 997.80]  Given that that's, given that their brand for better, whether it should be or not, has been this for a very long time.
[997.80 --> 998.80]  Yeah. We're already here.
[998.80 --> 1001.80]  I'm going to ask a question that you might not even want to answer.
[1001.80 --> 1002.80]  Okay.
[1002.80 --> 1008.80]  Should Twitchers just stuck to their guns and just said, yeah, this kind of soft core pornography is just part of the site now.
[1008.80 --> 1011.80]  If you don't like it, you don't have to look at it.
[1011.80 --> 1012.80]  Hmm.
[1012.80 --> 1022.80]  Um, yes, we're that desperate because our, our lunch is getting eaten by companies that are just willing to allow this on their platform.
[1022.80 --> 1029.80]  And realistically, what difference does it make if we have an age verification check versus their age verification check?
[1029.80 --> 1032.80]  I mean, it's on there. Do you imagine your kids aren't finding this stuff?
[1032.80 --> 1038.80]  I think the thing that makes me want to defend them sticking to their guns is that the other platforms are doing it.
[1038.80 --> 1041.80]  It's just not getting talked about as much. Like we said, it's on YouTube.
[1041.80 --> 1043.80]  It does feel like a bit of a double standard, doesn't it?
[1043.80 --> 1047.80]  It's, it's everywhere else. It's just not on Twitch so much.
[1047.80 --> 1052.80]  Uh, sticking to their guns. Sorry, we've got some, uh, apparently that's a colloquialism that is more local than I realized.
[1052.80 --> 1054.80]  It means just, it means holding their ground.
[1054.80 --> 1055.80]  Yeah.
[1055.80 --> 1058.80]  Just staying the course and going, yeah, these are the new terms of service.
[1058.80 --> 1061.80]  We don't really care about the backlash realistically.
[1061.80 --> 1062.80]  This is how it is.
[1062.80 --> 1063.80]  This is how it is.
[1063.80 --> 1064.80]  Yeah.
[1064.80 --> 1072.80]  Yeah. Cause Twitch feels like it, it gets way disproportionate amount of attention, uh, on this in particular.
[1072.80 --> 1077.80]  And I don't necessarily know why it might be because discoverability on Twitch is really hard for people.
[1077.80 --> 1083.80]  Um, and it's an extremely competitive space and it's extremely competitive space with a large amount of people trying to get into it.
[1083.80 --> 1089.80]  Um, and it's hard to even niche out in Twitch because of how like the categories works and stuff like that.
[1089.80 --> 1096.80]  Um, so I, I could, I could see it being more to more of a point of contention of like people being like, Oh no, they're taking my viewers.
[1096.80 --> 1105.80]  But I think really the biggest takeaway of that is like, if someone wants to watch that, despite these currently being on, they're not going to come watch WAN show.
[1105.80 --> 1107.80]  We're not losing any viewers.
[1107.80 --> 1112.80]  Um, that are like, because those people would just go to another website anyways.
[1112.80 --> 1116.80]  You know, like it's, it just doesn't, I, I don't know.
[1116.80 --> 1121.80]  Um, it's not like, it's not like there's this pool of people that like, it's their job to watch Twitch.
[1121.80 --> 1125.80]  This exact amount of people will watch Twitch and you get to pull from that group of people.
[1125.80 --> 1126.80]  That's not how the internet works.
[1126.80 --> 1128.80]  Right. So you're basically saying it's not a zero sum game.
[1128.80 --> 1129.80]  Yeah.
[1129.80 --> 1130.80]  Yeah.
[1130.80 --> 1131.80]  So I don't know.
[1131.80 --> 1137.80]  So is there an argument to be made that the game streamers could benefit from overall increased traffic on the site?
[1137.80 --> 1138.80]  They could, maybe.
[1138.80 --> 1140.80]  And they should just not worry about it.
[1140.80 --> 1148.80]  Because if that person is no longer interested in watching that particular stream for some various particular reason, they might now be more interested in watching gaming content.
[1148.80 --> 1150.80]  And maybe they'll stick around and check yours out.
[1150.80 --> 1159.80]  Or the whole site, because creators tend to be very algorithmically driven, the whole site might just devolve into,
[1159.80 --> 1160.80]  Maybe.
[1160.80 --> 1168.80]  Whether it's, you know, cutting off your camera right here and just chatting or whether it's installing nudie mods on all the games you're playing.
[1168.80 --> 1173.80]  It might just devolve into freaking everything just being butts and not being able to avoid it.
[1173.80 --> 1181.80]  And if this is a site you care about, a community that you love, that might be really upsetting for you if you're just not that into that and you wish it would just go back to the way it is.
[1181.80 --> 1183.80]  I mean, that's a legitimate position.
[1183.80 --> 1184.80]  Totally.
[1184.80 --> 1187.80]  I just think we're kind of past that already, personally.
[1187.80 --> 1188.80]  Hmm.
[1188.80 --> 1189.80]  Even without this change.
[1189.80 --> 1192.80]  Like I said, we've had hot tubs for a long time.
[1192.80 --> 1196.80]  Like it's, it's not just a gaming platform anymore.
[1196.80 --> 1197.80]  It just isn't.
[1197.80 --> 1204.80]  Just chatting is very legitimately by a lot the biggest category on the platform.
[1204.80 --> 1211.80]  Now you could say that gaming should be a category against something as broad as just chatting, but it isn't.
[1211.80 --> 1215.80]  So just chatting is always in the number one position on Twitch.
[1215.80 --> 1216.80]  Right.
[1217.80 --> 1218.80]  I don't know.
[1218.80 --> 1220.80]  Like there's no game right now.
[1220.80 --> 1228.80]  Um, at least that as far as I can see in the category view that comes to half of just chatting things like counter strike, which are like huge in the gaming space, right?
[1228.80 --> 1232.80]  Baldur's gate three currently winning every award on the planet.
[1232.80 --> 1235.80]  Um, why is anyone watching the day before whatever?
[1235.80 --> 1239.80]  Um, well, I mean, they might just want to watch the dumpster fire.
[1239.80 --> 1240.80]  Yeah.
[1240.80 --> 1242.80]  Uh, counter strike 21.4 K ball.
[1242.80 --> 1245.80]  There's gate three 8.9 K just chatting 433.
[1245.80 --> 1248.80]  Like, yeah, fortnight gets 171.
[1248.80 --> 1250.80]  Yeah, but that's still what you said.
[1250.80 --> 1252.80]  It's just less than half.
[1252.80 --> 1254.80]  And I can't even click on this right now.
[1254.80 --> 1255.80]  Right?
[1255.80 --> 1260.80]  Because so, so you didn't even have to scroll or like it was click on just chatting.
[1260.80 --> 1262.80]  And that was the top of just chatting.
[1262.80 --> 1263.80]  I didn't scroll.
[1263.80 --> 1264.80]  Right.
[1264.80 --> 1271.80]  So if you're, but then, but then remember too, a lot of the people arguing against the terms of service change, it's not like they're not already upset about that.
[1271.80 --> 1273.80]  And they probably don't want that to exist.
[1273.80 --> 1274.80]  Yeah.
[1274.80 --> 1284.80]  But what people I think need to remember is that Twitch is a company owned by Amazon, a giant mega corporation that is ultimately driven by one thing.
[1284.80 --> 1288.80]  And that's what's drive, what drives money and what drives money is eyeballs.
[1288.80 --> 1296.80]  And what drives eyeballs is apparently, I mean, I, I, I have no way of knowing for sure.
[1296.80 --> 1297.80]  I don't have their analytics.
[1297.80 --> 1300.80]  It just seems like it makes sense.
[1300.80 --> 1303.80]  Um, yeah, I don't know.
[1303.80 --> 1305.80]  I I've heard some ideas.
[1305.80 --> 1314.80]  Um, but I just, I just don't think it's going to go that way, but I've heard some ideas of like, oh, this is a perfect example of a, uh, opt in scenario.
[1314.80 --> 1321.80]  We're like, this is something you should have to manually toggle that you do want to see instead of having it be by default.
[1321.80 --> 1323.80]  But then I mean, plenty of stuff's like that.
[1323.80 --> 1330.80]  You have to, you have to manually enable allow explicit, you know, images or videos or whatever else it is.
[1331.80 --> 1339.80]  Uh, but again, back to the decisions being driven by at the end of the day, advertising dollars, which are driven by views.
[1339.80 --> 1346.80]  I don't think that Amazon or Twitch are in any kind of position where they feel like.
[1346.80 --> 1348.80]  They want people to have to click.
[1348.80 --> 1349.80]  Yeah, just for the, yeah, exactly.
[1349.80 --> 1355.80]  For the, for the good of, you know, something because we care about the morality police or whatever.
[1355.80 --> 1359.80]  We're just going to kiss goodbye some significant portion.
[1359.80 --> 1368.80]  Like, you know, from working on, you know, websites that the smallest amount of friction will send a user somewhere else.
[1368.80 --> 1369.80]  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
[1369.80 --> 1376.80]  And I think that's a good counter argument for what I was saying earlier about the nine keystrokes versus one click, right?
[1376.80 --> 1385.80]  Yeah. That small amount of friction could actually be the difference between, you know, my homepage on my computer is Twitch TV and I want something to watch.
[1385.80 --> 1390.80]  And I'm just going to click on something right on the homepage versus I'm going to navigate to some other site.
[1390.80 --> 1395.80]  Like people's decision making processes really can be what?
[1395.80 --> 1396.80]  You clicked it again.
[1396.80 --> 1397.80]  Well, I bet you did.
[1397.80 --> 1400.80]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1400.80 --> 1401.80]  He did it again.
[1401.80 --> 1402.80]  Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1402.80 --> 1407.80]  People in full plane chat are telling me I did it wrong because I need to sort by views or viewers, whatever.
[1407.80 --> 1408.80]  You're going to get us in trouble.
[1408.80 --> 1409.80]  No, I'm not scrolling down.
[1409.80 --> 1410.80]  I'm still, I'm staying.
[1410.80 --> 1411.80]  Oh, I see.
[1411.80 --> 1412.80]  I see.
[1412.80 --> 1414.80]  But it didn't fix it.
[1414.80 --> 1415.80]  No.
[1415.80 --> 1419.80]  Because I won't scroll down for you, but this one is what was there last time.
[1419.80 --> 1422.80]  I mean, I have no way of knowing what's below that purple bar.
[1422.80 --> 1423.80]  Yeah.
[1423.80 --> 1424.80]  I think you need to scroll.
[1424.80 --> 1425.80]  No.
[1425.80 --> 1427.80]  I will not.
[1427.80 --> 1430.80]  I'm going back here and then I'll scroll here.
[1430.80 --> 1431.80]  There, done.
[1431.80 --> 1432.80]  Oh, hold on.
[1432.80 --> 1433.80]  It doesn't.
[1433.80 --> 1434.80]  I just scrolled on the main page.
[1434.80 --> 1437.80]  Winter Wizard has quoted you here just checking.
[1437.80 --> 1438.80]  Yeah.
[1438.80 --> 1439.80]  Luke Lefrenier 2023.
[1439.80 --> 1440.80]  Oh my goodness.
[1440.80 --> 1441.80]  Just checking.
[1441.80 --> 1442.80]  Full plane chat.
[1442.80 --> 1443.80]  Full plane chat said I did it wrong.
[1443.80 --> 1447.80]  I used the default option the first time, which is just clicking on the chat category and that's what it showed.
[1447.80 --> 1451.80]  And then I clicked on views, high to low, and it was still there.
[1451.80 --> 1452.80]  So you guys are wrong.
[1453.80 --> 1454.80]  Get rekt.
[1455.80 --> 1458.80]  Anyway, I, I, I don't know the right answer here.
[1458.80 --> 1459.80]  On the one hand, I'm not logged in.
[1459.80 --> 1460.80]  Get over it.
[1460.80 --> 1461.80]  Oh my goodness.
[1461.80 --> 1462.80]  People.
[1462.80 --> 1463.80]  Got him.
[1463.80 --> 1466.80]  Oh my God.
[1467.80 --> 1468.80]  I don't know the right answer here.
[1468.80 --> 1473.80]  On the one hand, I do think Twitch has sort of been unfairly singled out here.
[1473.80 --> 1481.80]  There is a ton of this content available on basically any video or image like media sharing site on the entire internet.
[1481.80 --> 1484.80]  And you're not going to stop it.
[1484.80 --> 1493.80]  Um, but on the other hand, you know, should there be, should, should it matter, you know, what your brand is?
[1493.80 --> 1507.80]  And if your brand is supposed to be gaming, should you at least pretend to give a shit about, I think, I think even a lot of the just chatting streams are.
[1507.80 --> 1509.80]  I can't check.
[1509.80 --> 1515.80]  Supposed to be, you know, with gamers, with people who are culturally gamers, you know.
[1515.80 --> 1517.80]  I don't know if that's even true though.
[1517.80 --> 1520.80]  A lot of, a lot of really big streamers that I can think of.
[1521.80 --> 1522.80]  Okay.
[1522.80 --> 1523.80]  Like who?
[1523.80 --> 1525.80]  Uh, what's the, I don't remember his name.
[1525.80 --> 1527.80]  You built a computer for him.
[1528.80 --> 1529.80]  Oh, um.
[1529.80 --> 1530.80]  Like, does he game ever?
[1530.80 --> 1531.80]  I don't think so.
[1531.80 --> 1532.80]  I think so.
[1532.80 --> 1533.80]  Yeah.
[1533.80 --> 1534.80]  Hassan, right?
[1534.80 --> 1535.80]  Yeah.
[1535.80 --> 1536.80]  Does he game ever?
[1536.80 --> 1537.80]  I think so.
[1537.80 --> 1538.80]  I have no idea.
[1538.80 --> 1540.80]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[1540.80 --> 1541.80]  I don't watch Twitch.
[1541.80 --> 1544.80]  I, I didn't watch any of his videos before we did the collab.
[1544.80 --> 1545.80]  Yeah.
[1545.80 --> 1546.80]  And I haven't really tuned into anything after.
[1546.80 --> 1548.80]  Um, which may surprise some of you.
[1548.80 --> 1550.80]  Okay, he does stream in, in, in not just chatting.
[1550.80 --> 1551.80]  Holy crap, Luke.
[1551.80 --> 1552.80]  What?
[1552.80 --> 1556.80]  I, all I did was go to the homepage and I am immediately.
[1556.80 --> 1557.80]  I am immediately.
[1557.80 --> 1558.80]  I'm immediately.
[1558.80 --> 1559.80]  Yeah.
[1559.80 --> 1561.80]  I don't know.
[1561.80 --> 1568.06]  McDonald's and
[1568.06 --> 1570.36]  low cut tops let's go
[1570.36 --> 1571.66]  yeah
[1571.66 --> 1575.86]  I don't know
[1575.86 --> 1577.86]  but like yeah
[1577.86 --> 1580.94]  they can maybe do stuff
[1580.94 --> 1581.88]  with their
[1581.88 --> 1586.96]  yeah see I jumped to YouTube and that did
[1586.96 --> 1588.44]  not happen to me
[1588.44 --> 1588.96]  um
[1588.96 --> 1594.78]  no I think at some point
[1594.78 --> 1596.72]  he probably did play games or
[1596.72 --> 1598.32]  something but I don't really
[1598.32 --> 1600.88]  go to his channel there's a
[1600.88 --> 1602.38]  uh a thing
[1602.38 --> 1604.58]  Hassanabi's recently streamed
[1604.58 --> 1606.70]  categories and yeah just chatting
[1606.70 --> 1608.52]  is in number one and then there's special events
[1608.52 --> 1610.22]  which is also there but then he's got like
[1610.22 --> 1612.70]  lethal company which as far as I know is a newer game
[1612.70 --> 1614.50]  so this must have been somewhat recently
[1614.50 --> 1616.66]  okay um I don't
[1616.66 --> 1618.58]  know though again I don't I don't do the
[1618.58 --> 1619.70]  watching of the streams
[1619.70 --> 1622.34]  that's fair
[1622.34 --> 1624.52]  I can't find anything that doesn't seem
[1624.52 --> 1626.12]  to be anything other than sort of
[1626.12 --> 1627.52]  yeah neither can I so I don't know
[1627.52 --> 1628.22]  yeah predominantly
[1628.22 --> 1629.10]  talk show
[1629.10 --> 1632.32]  yeah so I I think I think there genuinely is
[1632.32 --> 1634.18]  quite a few creators on the platform that are
[1634.18 --> 1635.80]  just talk show
[1635.80 --> 1638.44]  there's also creators on the platform that just
[1638.44 --> 1640.22]  watch YouTube videos and
[1640.22 --> 1642.26]  do other things like that
[1642.26 --> 1644.02]  um that aren't gaming right
[1644.02 --> 1646.42]  so yeah I don't know
[1646.42 --> 1646.80]  I don't know
[1646.80 --> 1648.00]  and it's been that way for a long time
[1648.00 --> 1651.04]  and you know what else has been that way for a long time
[1651.04 --> 1653.10]  that's talking about this topic let's move on to something new
[1653.10 --> 1654.16]  yeah you want to pick one
[1654.16 --> 1657.12]  sure sure are we keeping on the things
[1657.12 --> 1659.08]  I mean you don't have to
[1659.08 --> 1660.54]  I was gonna leave mine on
[1660.54 --> 1662.86]  speaking of keeping these on
[1662.86 --> 1665.34]  you can't check who's monetized on YouTube anymore
[1665.34 --> 1668.28]  YouTube has removed a small piece of public code
[1668.28 --> 1671.30]  that indicates whether or not a channel is currently monetized
[1671.30 --> 1674.50]  the code doesn't reveal how much uh the channel is getting
[1674.50 --> 1677.76]  just the fact that they are a part of the YouTube partnership program
[1677.76 --> 1681.42]  this code has traditionally been used by creators marketers and journalists
[1681.42 --> 1683.90]  to confirm which channels are receiving money
[1683.90 --> 1687.96]  and by and by people of various motivations
[1687.96 --> 1691.48]  looking to petition YouTube to demonetize a particular channel
[1691.48 --> 1692.14]  okay I got you
[1692.14 --> 1695.76]  um this change has also broken several internet tools
[1695.76 --> 1698.02]  such as is this channel monetized
[1698.02 --> 1701.04]  which when asked if Linus Tech Tips is monetized
[1701.04 --> 1704.06]  simply responds that the user is sending too many requests
[1704.06 --> 1705.22]  what?
[1705.76 --> 1707.18]  also known as it's not working
[1707.18 --> 1708.54]  oh okay
[1708.54 --> 1712.48]  I I thought I thought we meant that it was like specific to our channel
[1712.48 --> 1712.90]  that it
[1712.90 --> 1716.28]  no I I think what they mean is that they tried it on our channel
[1716.28 --> 1718.38]  and that's the error code that it's currently spitting out
[1718.38 --> 1719.24]  because it is broken
[1719.24 --> 1720.26]  um
[1720.26 --> 1721.54]  discussion question
[1721.54 --> 1723.78]  should details about who and who isn't monetized
[1723.78 --> 1725.48]  be more or less readily available?
[1725.48 --> 1728.32]  I don't know I can think of
[1728.32 --> 1731.80]  almost immediately I can think of why YouTube would have wanted to do this
[1731.80 --> 1732.70]  um
[1732.70 --> 1736.86]  which I think is one point that we didn't necessarily bring up much about Twitch
[1736.86 --> 1740.42]  which is I think part of their motivation is just hoping that they can spend less time
[1740.42 --> 1741.66]  uh moderating
[1741.66 --> 1744.76]  and hoping that they can spend less time dealing with like
[1744.76 --> 1745.64]  the fact that
[1745.64 --> 1749.94]  one of the bigger Twitter accounts I know about is literally just
[1749.94 --> 1752.08]  is this person banned on Twitch or not
[1752.08 --> 1754.38]  um like that's a huge thing
[1754.38 --> 1755.96]  so I think they want to get away from that
[1755.96 --> 1757.20]  anytime that conversation
[1757.20 --> 1758.78]  comes up
[1758.78 --> 1760.12]  they have to talk about it again and again
[1760.12 --> 1761.34]  yeah chat was bringing up too
[1761.34 --> 1762.60]  that you know part of the reason
[1762.60 --> 1765.04]  part of the motivation for them to change the rules
[1765.04 --> 1766.66]  might have been to just
[1766.66 --> 1767.84]  avoid
[1767.84 --> 1769.72]  this constant
[1769.72 --> 1772.00]  cycle
[1772.00 --> 1774.10]  where someone does something to push the boundaries
[1774.10 --> 1775.64]  because that's what people do
[1775.64 --> 1777.04]  and then Twitch would respond
[1777.04 --> 1779.30]  often in an inconsistent manner
[1779.30 --> 1779.88]  yes
[1779.88 --> 1780.72]  and then
[1780.72 --> 1782.76]  it would spark this huge conversation
[1782.76 --> 1784.20]  where no matter what they do
[1784.20 --> 1785.22]  even if what they do is
[1785.22 --> 1785.84]  why does this person have favoritism
[1785.84 --> 1786.28]  blah blah blah
[1786.28 --> 1787.52]  even if what they did was
[1787.52 --> 1790.46]  100% in line with their community guidelines
[1790.46 --> 1794.32]  the conversation would still be about how horrible Twitch is
[1794.32 --> 1796.02]  because the rules weren't being applied evenly
[1796.02 --> 1797.88]  because of the other times that they didn't do it right
[1797.88 --> 1799.48]  so they were basically in this
[1799.48 --> 1799.98]  in this
[1799.98 --> 1800.98]  catch-22
[1800.98 --> 1802.62]  where if they don't do the right thing
[1802.62 --> 1804.76]  then they're criticized for
[1804.76 --> 1806.04]  doing the right thing before
[1806.04 --> 1807.28]  and if they do the right thing
[1807.28 --> 1808.42]  they're criticized for
[1808.42 --> 1809.78]  well why didn't they do it before
[1809.78 --> 1811.24]  and so if they just basically said
[1811.24 --> 1811.86]  okay well then
[1811.86 --> 1812.34]  f**k it
[1812.34 --> 1813.28]  everything's allowed
[1813.28 --> 1815.88]  that seemed like a way out
[1815.88 --> 1816.40]  and then
[1816.40 --> 1817.96]  the internet exploded
[1817.96 --> 1820.38]  and moderation does not scale well
[1820.38 --> 1822.50]  so when you're a huge platform
[1822.50 --> 1823.88]  moderation is like a big issue
[1823.88 --> 1824.44]  but anyways
[1824.44 --> 1825.10]  coming back
[1825.10 --> 1826.02]  to YouTube
[1826.02 --> 1827.88]  I think part of the reason for this
[1827.88 --> 1828.32]  is because yeah
[1828.32 --> 1829.48]  they don't want that type of stuff
[1829.48 --> 1830.28]  so when
[1830.28 --> 1831.24]  if they have a channel
[1831.24 --> 1832.80]  that's currently under fire
[1832.80 --> 1834.80]  and they decide to
[1834.80 --> 1835.60]  keep it monetized
[1835.60 --> 1836.16]  or not
[1836.16 --> 1837.78]  now they don't have to deal with the flack
[1837.78 --> 1839.08]  if they just take the flack
[1839.08 --> 1840.42]  for doing this once
[1840.42 --> 1841.62]  by shutting it down
[1841.62 --> 1842.94]  and there's probably
[1842.94 --> 1844.58]  I'm sure internally
[1844.58 --> 1845.16]  they were like
[1845.16 --> 1846.56]  oh this is going to get a bunch of bad press
[1846.56 --> 1847.00]  but they're like
[1847.00 --> 1848.20]  yeah it's going to get a bunch of bad press
[1848.20 --> 1848.82]  once
[1848.82 --> 1851.48]  and then now we don't have to deal with this problem anymore
[1851.48 --> 1853.04]  I wouldn't be surprised
[1853.04 --> 1855.92]  if this is the first move
[1855.92 --> 1858.74]  maybe not even the first move
[1858.74 --> 1860.82]  because we could go farther back
[1860.82 --> 1861.68]  like we could go
[1861.68 --> 1862.68]  we could go back to
[1862.68 --> 1862.96]  yeah
[1862.96 --> 1864.54]  just the reduction in transparency
[1864.54 --> 1866.58]  whether it's removing access to dislikes
[1866.58 --> 1869.40]  whether it's running ads
[1869.40 --> 1872.18]  on non-monetized channels
[1872.18 --> 1873.06]  yeah that was a while ago
[1873.06 --> 1873.48]  but yeah
[1873.48 --> 1874.54]  that was a long time ago
[1874.54 --> 1874.98]  yeah
[1874.98 --> 1876.08]  so that's the only reason
[1876.08 --> 1877.30]  this is a conversation at all
[1877.30 --> 1878.30]  because it used to be
[1878.30 --> 1879.44]  that you could check
[1879.44 --> 1880.76]  if a channel was monetized
[1880.76 --> 1882.88]  by just watching videos on it
[1882.88 --> 1883.10]  yeah
[1883.10 --> 1884.40]  and seeing if any ads played
[1884.40 --> 1885.08]  but nowadays
[1885.08 --> 1887.00]  it's impossible to tell
[1887.00 --> 1888.18]  because YouTube will just
[1888.18 --> 1890.22]  run ads against a channel
[1890.22 --> 1891.54]  regardless of whether
[1891.54 --> 1893.26]  they're actually paying out any revenue sharing
[1893.26 --> 1895.42]  one of the things I asked them back then was
[1895.42 --> 1896.56]  hey guys
[1896.56 --> 1898.50]  this is Austin
[1898.50 --> 1899.16]  no sorry
[1899.16 --> 1901.10]  one of the things I asked them back then was
[1901.10 --> 1901.46]  hey
[1901.46 --> 1906.38]  if you guys are taking 100% of the revenue share
[1906.38 --> 1909.96]  on any video that is not YouTube partner program
[1909.96 --> 1912.46]  don't you have a bit of a conflict of interest here
[1912.46 --> 1913.66]  don't you have an incentive
[1913.66 --> 1914.78]  to not allow people
[1914.78 --> 1915.94]  to promote videos
[1915.94 --> 1919.54]  that give you a 100% revenue share
[1919.54 --> 1919.90]  oh yeah that too
[1919.90 --> 1922.14]  versus a 60% revenue share
[1922.14 --> 1923.04]  or whatever the number is
[1923.04 --> 1924.30]  I forget the number
[1924.30 --> 1924.60]  because I always forget
[1924.60 --> 1925.78]  there was a theory back in the day
[1925.78 --> 1927.24]  that if you wanted to grow faster
[1927.24 --> 1928.74]  you'd turn off ads
[1928.74 --> 1931.82]  YouTube has always denied
[1931.82 --> 1934.48]  no just a theory yeah
[1934.48 --> 1935.02]  they're
[1935.02 --> 1935.86]  they take 45
[1935.86 --> 1936.92]  they take 45
[1936.92 --> 1937.58]  so
[1937.58 --> 1938.72]  so yeah
[1938.72 --> 1940.16]  so they would be taking 100%
[1940.16 --> 1941.68]  versus the 45%
[1941.68 --> 1942.40]  that they take
[1942.40 --> 1944.06]  when there's a
[1944.06 --> 1946.80]  when the ad plays on a YouTube partner channel
[1946.80 --> 1949.58]  they have denied
[1949.58 --> 1950.66]  every time
[1950.66 --> 1952.06]  anyone has brought it up
[1952.06 --> 1953.28]  that algorithmically
[1953.28 --> 1954.86]  there is any effect
[1954.86 --> 1958.12]  from the monetization of a video
[1958.12 --> 1960.00]  and I will say
[1960.00 --> 1961.26]  that personally
[1961.26 --> 1962.34]  anecdotally
[1962.34 --> 1964.12]  I have never seen evidence
[1964.12 --> 1965.16]  of an effect
[1965.16 --> 1966.54]  I have seen
[1966.54 --> 1968.24]  non-monetized videos
[1968.24 --> 1969.96]  do extremely well
[1969.96 --> 1971.92]  I have seen monetized videos
[1971.92 --> 1973.46]  do extremely poorly
[1973.46 --> 1974.60]  and there are
[1974.60 --> 1975.58]  various reasons
[1975.58 --> 1976.64]  why we may or may not
[1976.64 --> 1977.70]  have had monetization
[1977.70 --> 1978.54]  enabled on a video
[1978.54 --> 1979.18]  in the past
[1979.18 --> 1980.40]  sometimes it was a requirement
[1980.40 --> 1981.18]  from a sponsor
[1981.18 --> 1982.24]  that if we had
[1982.24 --> 1983.52]  an in-video integration
[1983.52 --> 1984.62]  they wanted
[1984.62 --> 1985.20]  their message
[1985.20 --> 1985.92]  to be the first thing
[1985.92 --> 1986.44]  people saw
[1986.44 --> 1987.84]  not some random YouTube ad
[1987.84 --> 1989.08]  so we would often
[1989.08 --> 1989.58]  have agreements
[1989.58 --> 1990.62]  where for the first six months
[1990.62 --> 1991.54]  we would have monetization
[1991.54 --> 1992.84]  on the platform disabled
[1992.84 --> 1994.62]  there are situations
[1994.62 --> 1995.18]  where
[1995.18 --> 1996.42]  you know
[1996.42 --> 1997.02]  the community
[1997.02 --> 1998.08]  doesn't feel like
[1998.08 --> 1998.70]  monetization
[1998.70 --> 1999.34]  is appropriate
[1999.34 --> 2000.16]  for a video
[2000.16 --> 2001.10]  like with the
[2001.10 --> 2002.14]  recent controversy
[2002.14 --> 2002.80]  for example
[2002.80 --> 2003.78]  so we've got monetization
[2003.78 --> 2004.20]  off that
[2004.20 --> 2005.26]  that didn't stop that video
[2005.26 --> 2006.86]  from getting 5 million views
[2006.86 --> 2007.70]  or something like that
[2007.70 --> 2008.32]  so
[2008.32 --> 2009.68]  if there is
[2009.68 --> 2010.60]  a legitimate interest
[2010.60 --> 2011.32]  from the audience
[2011.32 --> 2011.66]  no
[2011.66 --> 2013.80]  I just haven't actually seen
[2013.80 --> 2015.74]  evidence to support that
[2015.74 --> 2015.98]  but
[2015.98 --> 2017.92]  just because
[2017.92 --> 2020.58]  they haven't done it yet
[2020.58 --> 2022.98]  or haven't done it to me
[2022.98 --> 2024.42]  doesn't mean that
[2024.42 --> 2025.60]  they won't do it ever
[2025.60 --> 2026.62]  or haven't done it
[2026.62 --> 2027.68]  to anyone
[2027.68 --> 2029.42]  yeah
[2029.42 --> 2031.06]  and it doesn't mean
[2031.06 --> 2031.96]  that I would have any way
[2031.96 --> 2033.12]  of being able to tell
[2033.12 --> 2034.76]  like if YouTube suddenly
[2034.76 --> 2035.38]  you know
[2035.38 --> 2036.88]  turned up the heat
[2036.88 --> 2037.90]  on their ad sales
[2037.90 --> 2038.78]  and sold
[2038.78 --> 2040.54]  20% more inventory
[2040.54 --> 2041.50]  against the same number
[2041.50 --> 2042.52]  of views on the platform
[2042.52 --> 2043.74]  and they were just like
[2043.74 --> 2044.22]  hmm
[2044.22 --> 2045.88]  why don't we just put
[2045.88 --> 2047.50]  all of this
[2047.50 --> 2048.76]  on random videos
[2048.76 --> 2049.98]  about dishwasher repair
[2049.98 --> 2052.86]  and take 100%
[2052.86 --> 2053.76]  instead of
[2053.76 --> 2055.30]  45%
[2055.30 --> 2056.46]  and no one will be
[2056.46 --> 2056.96]  any the wiser
[2056.96 --> 2057.54]  woohoo
[2057.54 --> 2060.04]  I would have no way
[2060.04 --> 2060.48]  of knowing that
[2060.48 --> 2061.30]  nobody would have any way
[2061.30 --> 2061.78]  of knowing that
[2061.78 --> 2062.44]  and in fact
[2062.44 --> 2063.76]  what I suspect
[2063.76 --> 2064.80]  although I don't
[2064.80 --> 2065.60]  have any way of knowing
[2065.60 --> 2066.16]  this for sure
[2066.16 --> 2066.94]  but what I suspect
[2066.94 --> 2069.06]  is that a lot of these
[2069.06 --> 2069.94]  decisions about
[2069.94 --> 2070.90]  which videos
[2070.90 --> 2072.90]  are monetized
[2072.90 --> 2073.68]  or which ones are being
[2073.68 --> 2074.42]  served in ad
[2074.42 --> 2074.88]  and when
[2074.88 --> 2076.36]  I suspect a lot of
[2076.36 --> 2076.86]  these decisions
[2076.86 --> 2078.28]  are actually driven by AI
[2078.28 --> 2080.04]  and driven algorithmically
[2080.04 --> 2081.76]  so it would be
[2081.76 --> 2082.62]  nearly impossible
[2082.62 --> 2083.86]  for even an internal
[2083.86 --> 2084.62]  whistleblower
[2084.62 --> 2085.58]  to say
[2085.58 --> 2086.60]  yeah
[2086.60 --> 2087.38]  the executives
[2087.38 --> 2088.02]  got together
[2088.02 --> 2089.12]  and like made a call
[2089.12 --> 2090.06]  that we're going to put
[2090.06 --> 2090.68]  all of our
[2090.68 --> 2091.00]  you know
[2091.00 --> 2091.92]  new ad inventory
[2091.92 --> 2092.56]  on these
[2092.56 --> 2093.70]  because at the end
[2093.70 --> 2094.24]  of the day
[2094.24 --> 2095.84]  most of these engines
[2095.84 --> 2096.56]  are just
[2096.56 --> 2097.42]  input
[2097.42 --> 2098.78]  experiment
[2098.78 --> 2100.66]  try to achieve goals
[2100.66 --> 2101.42]  so if the input
[2101.42 --> 2101.92]  is
[2101.92 --> 2103.02]  you know
[2103.02 --> 2103.90]  optimize
[2103.90 --> 2105.10]  revenue
[2105.10 --> 2106.00]  for the platform
[2106.00 --> 2106.94]  well
[2106.94 --> 2107.88]  part of optimizing
[2107.88 --> 2108.32]  revenue
[2108.32 --> 2109.44]  is going to be
[2109.44 --> 2110.38]  putting
[2110.38 --> 2111.38]  ads
[2111.38 --> 2112.00]  on videos
[2112.00 --> 2112.44]  that are very
[2112.44 --> 2113.36]  engaging for viewers
[2113.36 --> 2114.36]  so that you have
[2114.36 --> 2115.54]  a longer watch session
[2115.54 --> 2116.32]  so they'll watch more
[2116.32 --> 2117.58]  videos and watch more ads
[2117.58 --> 2119.02]  but part of that strategy
[2119.02 --> 2120.66]  could also be recognizing
[2120.66 --> 2121.92]  hey this is probably
[2121.92 --> 2122.66]  a one and done
[2122.66 --> 2123.48]  I should probably
[2123.48 --> 2125.00]  cram as many ads
[2125.00 --> 2126.24]  down this person's throat
[2126.24 --> 2127.38]  while they try and
[2127.38 --> 2128.22]  troubleshoot an old
[2128.22 --> 2129.12]  CRT TV
[2129.12 --> 2130.28]  and they absolutely
[2130.28 --> 2131.24]  need this information
[2131.24 --> 2132.66]  and take 100%
[2132.66 --> 2133.22]  of that money
[2133.22 --> 2134.08]  yeah
[2134.08 --> 2136.34]  and the actual teams
[2136.34 --> 2137.68]  who create these
[2137.68 --> 2138.32]  algorithms
[2138.32 --> 2139.80]  wouldn't necessarily
[2139.80 --> 2141.06]  know exactly
[2141.06 --> 2141.94]  what it's doing
[2141.94 --> 2143.16]  minute to minute
[2143.16 --> 2144.74]  they could go back
[2144.74 --> 2145.18]  and kind of go
[2145.18 --> 2145.98]  okay so here's a thing
[2145.98 --> 2146.56]  that appears to be
[2146.56 --> 2146.90]  happening
[2146.90 --> 2147.92]  but nobody
[2147.92 --> 2149.66]  made that decision
[2149.66 --> 2150.26]  so there's
[2150.26 --> 2151.12]  nobody is culpable
[2151.12 --> 2151.68]  for it
[2151.68 --> 2153.02]  and so again
[2153.02 --> 2153.82]  I'm not saying
[2153.82 --> 2154.50]  this is happening
[2154.50 --> 2155.86]  I'm just saying
[2155.86 --> 2157.74]  it's not implausible
[2157.74 --> 2158.42]  yeah
[2158.42 --> 2159.54]  if that makes sense
[2159.54 --> 2160.52]  um
[2160.52 --> 2161.86]  I wonder
[2161.86 --> 2162.92]  if this is
[2162.92 --> 2165.06]  just the next move
[2165.06 --> 2167.00]  towards what will be
[2167.00 --> 2168.90]  the next next move
[2168.90 --> 2169.96]  which is not being able
[2169.96 --> 2171.28]  to check if a video
[2171.28 --> 2172.22]  is monetized
[2172.22 --> 2174.40]  tell me this
[2174.40 --> 2176.52]  what benefit is there
[2176.52 --> 2177.18]  to YouTube
[2177.18 --> 2179.16]  for you to know
[2179.16 --> 2180.30]  if the creator
[2180.30 --> 2181.56]  monetized that video
[2181.56 --> 2186.76]  so
[2186.76 --> 2190.18]  would this
[2190.18 --> 2191.08]  are you saying
[2191.08 --> 2191.10]  are you saying
[2191.10 --> 2191.74]  this would also
[2191.74 --> 2192.34]  obfuscate
[2192.34 --> 2193.24]  to the creator
[2193.24 --> 2194.24]  or just to users
[2194.24 --> 2194.94]  just to users
[2194.94 --> 2195.32]  yeah
[2195.32 --> 2195.74]  yeah
[2195.74 --> 2196.86]  that makes sense
[2196.86 --> 2198.42]  because back to the
[2198.42 --> 2199.82]  back to the Twitch conversation
[2199.82 --> 2202.10]  it would keep
[2202.10 --> 2202.68]  YouTube
[2202.68 --> 2203.70]  out of the news
[2203.70 --> 2204.42]  yeah
[2204.42 --> 2205.56]  it's like
[2205.56 --> 2205.92]  yeah
[2205.92 --> 2206.28]  just
[2206.28 --> 2207.54]  ads are just normal
[2207.54 --> 2209.00]  and you click on videos
[2209.00 --> 2209.94]  and there are ads
[2209.94 --> 2211.10]  and it is absolutely
[2211.10 --> 2212.00]  none of your business
[2212.00 --> 2213.24]  from YouTube's perspective
[2213.24 --> 2214.76]  whether that channel
[2214.76 --> 2216.02]  is part of the partner program
[2216.02 --> 2217.32]  whether that video
[2217.32 --> 2218.02]  is
[2218.02 --> 2218.74]  you know
[2218.74 --> 2220.08]  monetized by the creator
[2220.08 --> 2221.38]  or not monetized
[2221.38 --> 2221.98]  by the creator
[2221.98 --> 2222.78]  because you know
[2222.78 --> 2223.52]  imagine this
[2223.52 --> 2224.02]  you know
[2224.02 --> 2225.98]  imagine a controversial creator
[2225.98 --> 2226.98]  you know
[2226.98 --> 2227.62]  like especially
[2227.62 --> 2227.86]  you know
[2227.86 --> 2228.54]  you look at the way
[2228.54 --> 2229.44]  that politics
[2229.44 --> 2231.02]  are super polarized
[2231.02 --> 2232.32]  in the states right now
[2232.32 --> 2232.54]  right
[2232.54 --> 2233.52]  so let's say
[2233.52 --> 2235.22]  no matter what side it is
[2235.22 --> 2236.56]  someone is going to be
[2236.56 --> 2237.58]  super angry
[2237.58 --> 2240.00]  about some political commentator
[2240.00 --> 2240.96]  being on the platform
[2240.96 --> 2241.60]  for sure
[2241.60 --> 2242.94]  and having the video
[2242.94 --> 2243.60]  monetized
[2243.60 --> 2245.40]  and going to call
[2245.40 --> 2246.60]  for some kind of boycott
[2246.60 --> 2247.40]  of the platform
[2247.40 --> 2249.64]  for supporting them
[2249.64 --> 2251.12]  for sharing money with them
[2251.12 --> 2252.72]  and so if YouTube
[2252.72 --> 2254.48]  just kind of went
[2254.48 --> 2255.84]  yeah
[2255.84 --> 2256.52]  how about you just
[2256.52 --> 2257.66]  not know
[2257.66 --> 2258.86]  you not know
[2258.86 --> 2259.58]  who's getting money
[2259.58 --> 2260.48]  you not know
[2260.48 --> 2261.18]  which videos
[2261.18 --> 2261.86]  they've enabled
[2261.86 --> 2262.84]  monetization on
[2262.84 --> 2264.10]  I think that you'll still
[2264.10 --> 2265.38]  see creators
[2265.38 --> 2266.24]  you know
[2266.24 --> 2266.98]  as a gesture
[2266.98 --> 2267.68]  talk about
[2267.68 --> 2267.90]  hey
[2267.90 --> 2269.54]  I'm turning monetization
[2269.54 --> 2270.92]  off on this video
[2270.92 --> 2271.50]  or
[2271.50 --> 2272.68]  you know
[2272.68 --> 2273.96]  one that you see
[2273.96 --> 2275.04]  probably more often
[2275.04 --> 2275.68]  than that is
[2275.68 --> 2276.74]  which we could lie about
[2276.74 --> 2276.98]  now
[2276.98 --> 2277.58]  I'm going to donate
[2277.58 --> 2278.10]  the proceeds
[2278.10 --> 2278.32]  or at that point
[2278.32 --> 2278.92]  not now
[2278.92 --> 2280.34]  but at that point
[2280.34 --> 2281.90]  there'd be no follow up
[2281.90 --> 2282.72]  no accountability
[2282.72 --> 2285.30]  and I don't think
[2285.30 --> 2286.24]  that from YouTube's
[2286.24 --> 2286.64]  perspective
[2286.64 --> 2287.94]  that's a problem
[2287.94 --> 2288.62]  yeah
[2288.62 --> 2290.68]  why do they care
[2290.68 --> 2292.84]  and it sucks
[2292.84 --> 2293.34]  because this is
[2293.34 --> 2294.74]  I love pulling it
[2294.74 --> 2295.32]  all the way back
[2295.32 --> 2295.64]  to this
[2295.64 --> 2296.32]  every time
[2296.32 --> 2297.04]  but this is the
[2297.04 --> 2297.90]  Blizzard developers
[2297.90 --> 2298.90]  on stage problem
[2298.90 --> 2300.52]  where
[2300.52 --> 2302.28]  more transparency
[2302.28 --> 2303.04]  more access
[2303.04 --> 2304.08]  to different parts
[2304.08 --> 2304.56]  of companies
[2304.56 --> 2305.00]  and stuff
[2305.00 --> 2305.68]  just gets them
[2305.68 --> 2306.44]  put on pikes
[2306.44 --> 2307.08]  constantly
[2307.08 --> 2310.76]  which sucks
[2310.76 --> 2311.38]  because it's a thing
[2311.38 --> 2312.16]  everybody wants
[2312.16 --> 2313.44]  but
[2313.44 --> 2314.62]  it ends up
[2314.62 --> 2315.54]  getting shut down
[2315.54 --> 2316.12]  due to
[2316.12 --> 2316.94]  community responses
[2316.94 --> 2317.38]  to things
[2317.38 --> 2318.20]  because it's easier
[2318.20 --> 2318.80]  to
[2318.80 --> 2320.16]  blow up
[2320.16 --> 2320.98]  about the stuff
[2320.98 --> 2322.14]  that you can see
[2322.14 --> 2323.50]  and that is in your face
[2323.50 --> 2324.08]  all the time
[2324.08 --> 2325.56]  than dig for things
[2325.56 --> 2326.08]  and I think
[2326.08 --> 2326.94]  a lot of
[2326.94 --> 2327.92]  companies
[2327.92 --> 2329.36]  and maybe people
[2329.36 --> 2330.66]  are just
[2330.66 --> 2331.92]  tired
[2331.92 --> 2333.74]  of there being
[2333.74 --> 2334.36]  some kind
[2334.36 --> 2335.50]  of controversy
[2335.50 --> 2337.30]  and just
[2337.30 --> 2338.26]  looking for
[2338.26 --> 2338.86]  looking for
[2338.86 --> 2339.48]  sources of
[2339.48 --> 2340.00]  controversy
[2340.00 --> 2340.58]  and just kind
[2340.58 --> 2340.94]  of going
[2340.94 --> 2341.88]  oh okay
[2341.88 --> 2342.46]  that's a source
[2342.46 --> 2342.54]  of
[2342.54 --> 2343.30]  okay
[2343.30 --> 2343.84]  let's just
[2343.84 --> 2344.28]  make it
[2344.28 --> 2344.56]  so that
[2344.56 --> 2345.08]  doesn't happen
[2345.08 --> 2345.36]  again
[2345.36 --> 2346.52]  let's make it
[2346.52 --> 2346.88]  so that one
[2346.88 --> 2347.34]  doesn't happen
[2347.34 --> 2347.56]  again
[2347.56 --> 2348.16]  and if you
[2348.16 --> 2348.38]  just
[2348.38 --> 2349.12]  slowly
[2349.12 --> 2350.60]  pick these
[2350.60 --> 2351.02]  away
[2351.02 --> 2351.62]  and there's
[2351.62 --> 2352.08]  honestly
[2352.08 --> 2352.76]  very little
[2352.76 --> 2353.22]  benefit
[2353.22 --> 2354.10]  for a
[2354.10 --> 2354.60]  platform
[2354.60 --> 2355.60]  to
[2355.60 --> 2356.64]  for a
[2356.64 --> 2357.18]  platform
[2357.18 --> 2357.84]  itself
[2357.84 --> 2358.76]  think of the
[2358.76 --> 2359.30]  amount of times
[2359.30 --> 2359.90]  that a platform
[2359.90 --> 2360.40]  itself
[2360.40 --> 2361.18]  was in the news
[2361.18 --> 2361.72]  and it was a good
[2361.72 --> 2361.98]  thing
[2361.98 --> 2363.68]  usually
[2363.68 --> 2364.68]  what the platforms
[2364.68 --> 2365.50]  want is they want
[2365.50 --> 2366.14]  the creators
[2366.14 --> 2367.10]  on the platform
[2367.10 --> 2368.86]  to be popping off
[2368.86 --> 2369.38]  all over the place
[2369.38 --> 2370.16]  because then that pulls
[2370.16 --> 2370.92]  people into the platform
[2370.92 --> 2371.46]  anyways
[2371.46 --> 2372.32]  and then if you're
[2372.32 --> 2372.94]  spending more time
[2372.94 --> 2373.52]  on the platform
[2373.52 --> 2374.78]  then while you're
[2374.78 --> 2375.86]  on the platform
[2375.86 --> 2376.52]  the platform can
[2376.52 --> 2376.94]  kind of
[2376.94 --> 2378.10]  try to monetize you
[2378.10 --> 2379.02]  YouTube premium
[2379.02 --> 2379.74]  Twitch turbo
[2379.74 --> 2380.62]  whatever it is
[2380.62 --> 2382.16]  but you want the
[2382.16 --> 2382.86]  creator to be
[2382.86 --> 2383.52]  pulling people in
[2383.52 --> 2384.64]  you don't really want
[2384.64 --> 2385.90]  your name plastered
[2385.90 --> 2386.44]  all over the place
[2386.44 --> 2386.80]  all the time
[2386.80 --> 2387.58]  because it's
[2387.58 --> 2388.58]  almost guaranteed
[2388.58 --> 2389.22]  going to be
[2389.22 --> 2390.08]  negative information
[2390.08 --> 2390.66]  well that's the
[2390.66 --> 2390.86]  thing
[2390.86 --> 2391.44]  like negative
[2391.44 --> 2392.60]  negativity sells
[2392.60 --> 2393.66]  um
[2393.66 --> 2395.26]  I could
[2395.26 --> 2396.16]  I could probably
[2396.16 --> 2397.10]  count on my
[2397.10 --> 2397.94]  hands and feet
[2397.94 --> 2399.06]  the number of
[2399.06 --> 2400.00]  times that
[2400.00 --> 2401.16]  we have made
[2401.16 --> 2401.68]  the news
[2401.68 --> 2402.22]  for anything
[2402.22 --> 2402.74]  positive
[2402.74 --> 2403.54]  in the entire
[2403.54 --> 2404.00]  time this
[2404.00 --> 2404.64]  company has
[2404.64 --> 2405.10]  existed
[2405.10 --> 2406.38]  and I would
[2406.38 --> 2406.88]  need more
[2406.88 --> 2407.32]  than those
[2407.32 --> 2407.74]  digits
[2407.74 --> 2408.50]  to count
[2408.50 --> 2408.92]  the number
[2408.92 --> 2409.74]  of articles
[2409.74 --> 2410.62]  and mentions
[2410.62 --> 2411.50]  and videos
[2411.50 --> 2412.96]  just in the
[2412.96 --> 2413.74]  last few
[2413.74 --> 2414.40]  months alone
[2414.40 --> 2414.86]  yeah
[2414.86 --> 2415.66]  right
[2415.66 --> 2416.18]  like it
[2416.18 --> 2416.54]  it's
[2416.54 --> 2417.04]  it's no
[2417.04 --> 2417.56]  secret
[2417.56 --> 2418.14]  that
[2418.14 --> 2419.14]  people
[2419.14 --> 2419.90]  people want
[2419.90 --> 2420.16]  to see
[2420.16 --> 2420.62]  a scandal
[2420.62 --> 2421.06]  they want
[2421.06 --> 2421.46]  to see
[2421.46 --> 2422.32]  a downfall
[2422.32 --> 2423.08]  they don't
[2423.08 --> 2423.80]  want to see
[2423.80 --> 2425.42]  slow consistent
[2425.42 --> 2426.24]  growth
[2426.24 --> 2426.84]  they don't
[2426.84 --> 2427.56]  want to see
[2427.56 --> 2428.54]  you know
[2428.54 --> 2430.18]  a more
[2430.18 --> 2431.26]  complex story
[2431.26 --> 2432.14]  uh about
[2432.14 --> 2432.68]  you know
[2432.68 --> 2433.96]  growing pains
[2433.96 --> 2435.00]  and and
[2435.00 --> 2436.02]  trying your best
[2436.02 --> 2436.62]  and sometimes
[2436.62 --> 2437.50]  screwing up
[2437.50 --> 2438.00]  and
[2438.00 --> 2440.94]  like it's
[2440.94 --> 2442.72]  it's nuanced
[2442.72 --> 2443.60]  and that's a lot
[2443.60 --> 2443.98]  of work
[2443.98 --> 2444.56]  it's a lot
[2444.56 --> 2444.86]  of mental
[2444.86 --> 2445.24]  load
[2445.24 --> 2446.10]  I think
[2446.10 --> 2446.58]  that
[2446.58 --> 2447.70]  something
[2447.70 --> 2448.28]  is bad
[2448.28 --> 2448.74]  is
[2448.74 --> 2449.82]  more
[2449.82 --> 2450.34]  entertaining
[2450.34 --> 2451.38]  it's easier
[2451.38 --> 2452.68]  it's it's it's
[2452.68 --> 2453.32]  it's popcorn
[2453.32 --> 2454.04]  it goes down
[2454.04 --> 2454.78]  easy you know
[2454.78 --> 2455.64]  deprecated said
[2455.64 --> 2456.06]  they want
[2456.06 --> 2456.62]  strawberry
[2456.62 --> 2457.28]  but honestly
[2457.28 --> 2457.80]  you can you
[2457.80 --> 2458.62]  can deconstruct
[2458.62 --> 2460.20]  that relatively
[2460.20 --> 2460.94]  simple sentence
[2460.94 --> 2461.34]  a little bit
[2461.34 --> 2461.68]  and like
[2461.68 --> 2462.06]  yeah
[2462.06 --> 2462.92]  the hack
[2462.92 --> 2463.40]  brought in
[2463.40 --> 2464.76]  a incredible
[2464.76 --> 2465.22]  amount of
[2465.22 --> 2465.58]  attention
[2465.58 --> 2466.10]  yeah
[2466.10 --> 2467.46]  incredible
[2467.46 --> 2467.90]  amount
[2467.90 --> 2468.28]  yep
[2468.28 --> 2472.06]  we had more
[2472.06 --> 2472.60]  eyes on us
[2472.60 --> 2473.04]  than like
[2473.04 --> 2473.46]  ever
[2473.46 --> 2474.10]  basically
[2474.10 --> 2474.78]  well
[2474.78 --> 2475.28]  not quite
[2475.28 --> 2475.72]  there was
[2475.72 --> 2476.08]  another one
[2476.08 --> 2476.54]  after that
[2476.54 --> 2477.64]  um but
[2477.64 --> 2479.20]  ever so
[2479.20 --> 2479.74]  far
[2479.74 --> 2484.96]  um but
[2484.96 --> 2485.54]  like yeah
[2485.54 --> 2486.66]  it was um
[2486.66 --> 2487.20]  that was a
[2487.20 --> 2487.58]  big deal
[2487.58 --> 2488.08]  and it wasn't
[2488.08 --> 2488.86]  obviously just
[2488.86 --> 2489.54]  the strawberry
[2489.54 --> 2490.32]  but like that's
[2490.32 --> 2491.18]  part of part of
[2491.18 --> 2491.80]  the story that
[2491.80 --> 2492.34]  brought tons of
[2492.34 --> 2492.74]  people in
[2492.74 --> 2493.86]  and like all
[2493.86 --> 2494.58]  of our properties
[2494.58 --> 2495.58]  exploded in a
[2495.58 --> 2496.22]  good way at that
[2496.22 --> 2496.44]  time
[2496.44 --> 2496.82]  yeah
[2496.82 --> 2497.04]  yeah
[2497.04 --> 2497.68]  there was more
[2497.68 --> 2498.04]  eyes on the
[2498.04 --> 2498.44]  channel there's
[2498.44 --> 2498.84]  more eyes on
[2498.84 --> 2499.36]  flowplane there's
[2499.36 --> 2499.82]  more eyes on
[2499.82 --> 2500.62]  ltt store there's
[2500.62 --> 2501.14]  more eyes on
[2501.14 --> 2501.50]  everything
[2501.50 --> 2502.60]  dave ger says
[2502.60 --> 2503.46]  no one reads a
[2503.46 --> 2504.66]  news story that
[2504.66 --> 2505.38]  has the headline
[2505.38 --> 2506.68]  100 children had
[2506.68 --> 2507.44]  a good day today
[2507.44 --> 2508.14]  and nothing bad
[2508.14 --> 2510.26]  happened you know
[2510.26 --> 2512.24]  i was watching um i
[2512.24 --> 2512.88]  was watching the
[2512.88 --> 2514.48]  karate kid with my
[2514.48 --> 2515.40]  son and his friend
[2515.40 --> 2516.50]  um because they were
[2516.50 --> 2517.20]  checking out the new
[2517.20 --> 2518.38]  tv and they had a
[2518.38 --> 2519.14]  sleepover and they
[2519.14 --> 2519.62]  were watching the
[2519.62 --> 2520.20]  movie and i was
[2520.20 --> 2521.54]  like uh first one
[2521.54 --> 2523.32]  nice um and and i
[2523.32 --> 2525.02]  was like i'm not i'm
[2525.02 --> 2525.80]  not gonna be that
[2525.80 --> 2527.06]  like weird parent that
[2527.06 --> 2528.56]  comes and hangs out
[2528.56 --> 2530.02]  with you know let
[2530.02 --> 2530.60]  them let them do
[2530.60 --> 2531.74]  their thing but they
[2531.74 --> 2532.54]  were very settled
[2532.54 --> 2533.38]  into their movie they
[2533.38 --> 2534.08]  were not like talking
[2534.08 --> 2535.46]  about anything and i
[2535.46 --> 2536.32]  sat in the back row
[2536.32 --> 2537.64]  and just kind of was
[2537.64 --> 2538.28]  like yeah you know
[2538.28 --> 2539.30]  what i'm gonna watch
[2539.30 --> 2540.42]  the karate kid i guess
[2540.42 --> 2542.02]  it's been i was
[2542.02 --> 2543.66]  probably his age yeah
[2543.66 --> 2544.30]  the last time i
[2544.30 --> 2545.74]  watched it yeah um
[2545.74 --> 2547.80]  and there's a scene
[2547.80 --> 2550.14]  where um where the
[2550.14 --> 2552.38]  sensei uh lends the
[2552.38 --> 2553.42]  kid i forget anyone's
[2553.42 --> 2554.28]  names in the movie or
[2554.28 --> 2554.84]  whatever but the
[2554.84 --> 2556.22]  sensei lends the kid
[2556.22 --> 2558.58]  his car and it's like
[2558.58 --> 2560.94]  you know his collection
[2560.94 --> 2562.70]  of cars is like his
[2562.70 --> 2564.04]  these are prized
[2564.04 --> 2565.54]  possessions like the
[2565.54 --> 2567.88]  kids like mind blown
[2567.88 --> 2569.28]  that when it's time for
[2569.28 --> 2570.36]  the dance or prom or
[2570.36 --> 2571.66]  whatever it is that he's
[2571.66 --> 2572.56]  allowed to borrow this
[2572.56 --> 2574.60]  car and they go out of
[2574.60 --> 2575.70]  their way right like
[2575.70 --> 2577.30]  remember american car
[2577.30 --> 2578.32]  culture was still a
[2578.32 --> 2579.60]  thing kind of in the
[2579.60 --> 2580.64]  80s like it was sort of
[2580.64 --> 2583.72]  coming towards a time of
[2583.72 --> 2586.28]  big change um but it
[2586.28 --> 2587.76]  was still very much a
[2587.76 --> 2589.02]  thing in the 80s and
[2589.02 --> 2589.94]  so even without
[2589.94 --> 2591.58]  necessarily you know
[2591.58 --> 2592.60]  product placements and
[2592.60 --> 2593.48]  making sure that the
[2593.48 --> 2594.58]  emblems are in every
[2594.58 --> 2595.92]  flipping shot or whatever
[2595.92 --> 2597.62]  there was clearly a lot
[2597.62 --> 2599.02]  of thought and work that
[2599.02 --> 2600.44]  went into making this car
[2600.44 --> 2602.20]  look like a million bucks
[2602.20 --> 2604.78]  like it was beautiful and
[2604.78 --> 2606.14]  the way it shines when he
[2606.14 --> 2608.84]  drives it and and and he
[2608.84 --> 2610.48]  he rolls out in the car to
[2610.48 --> 2612.44]  go pick up the girl you
[2612.44 --> 2616.08]  know and um then they go
[2616.08 --> 2617.28]  on their date and he kind
[2617.28 --> 2618.34]  of passes off the car as
[2618.34 --> 2619.02]  his own because he's
[2619.02 --> 2620.28]  like trying to show off a
[2620.28 --> 2622.08]  little bit and asks her if
[2622.08 --> 2623.66]  she wants to drive it and
[2623.66 --> 2624.88]  she gets behind the wheel
[2624.88 --> 2626.90]  and i think she's only just
[2626.90 --> 2628.18]  gotten her license and he
[2628.18 --> 2629.56]  got his license like that
[2629.56 --> 2631.42]  day or something like that
[2631.42 --> 2634.28]  and they they pull out of
[2634.28 --> 2635.32]  the parking lot from the
[2635.32 --> 2636.92]  dance and she's like asking
[2636.92 --> 2638.88]  how fast does it go and he
[2638.88 --> 2640.82]  responds i don't want to
[2640.82 --> 2642.62]  find out and it fades to
[2642.62 --> 2643.50]  black and then the next
[2643.50 --> 2648.26]  scene comes and i was
[2648.26 --> 2651.66]  sitting there going they
[2651.66 --> 2653.22]  don't do that anymore no
[2653.22 --> 2655.58]  something never something
[2655.58 --> 2657.40]  scandalous crashing man that
[2657.40 --> 2660.18]  scandal dad's piss is too
[2660.18 --> 2662.06]  spicy and it's someone's
[2662.06 --> 2662.98]  going to the hospital it's
[2662.98 --> 2666.08]  too easy to create a
[2666.08 --> 2668.92]  tension to create an angry
[2668.92 --> 2670.66]  scene to create heightened
[2670.66 --> 2671.86]  emotions between our
[2671.86 --> 2673.40]  characters by having this
[2673.40 --> 2675.40]  prized possession damaged i
[2675.40 --> 2676.94]  can't remember the last time
[2676.94 --> 2679.14]  i saw an interaction between
[2679.14 --> 2680.32]  characters in a piece of
[2680.32 --> 2681.98]  media where someone lends
[2681.98 --> 2683.52]  someone else something that
[2683.52 --> 2684.62]  is one of their most prized
[2684.62 --> 2686.12]  possessions and the other
[2686.12 --> 2688.60]  one respectfully cares for it
[2688.60 --> 2689.84]  and returns it in pristine
[2689.84 --> 2691.84]  condition after enjoying it and
[2691.84 --> 2692.36]  is thankful
[2692.36 --> 2696.56]  yeah and i'm not trying to say
[2696.56 --> 2698.22]  the 80s was better or whatever
[2698.22 --> 2700.84]  because i realistically i wasn't
[2700.84 --> 2702.26]  even there i wasn't born yet
[2702.26 --> 2704.54]  right and it's clear that there
[2704.54 --> 2705.94]  were lots of problems you know
[2705.94 --> 2706.86]  it's not like we don't have
[2706.86 --> 2708.72]  pretty in-depth historical
[2708.72 --> 2710.68]  records yeah i'm just saying that
[2710.68 --> 2714.34]  from a media standpoint a little
[2714.34 --> 2716.36]  bit less we're very dialed into
[2716.36 --> 2720.74]  anger and controversy and upset
[2720.74 --> 2723.96]  and and disrespect um and you
[2723.96 --> 2726.78]  didn't you didn't need that you
[2726.78 --> 2728.06]  didn't need that in this movie
[2728.06 --> 2729.06]  one of the biggest improvements
[2729.06 --> 2731.86]  i've done for myself over the last
[2731.86 --> 2732.90]  little while is to try to
[2732.90 --> 2734.00]  disconnect from that stuff
[2734.00 --> 2736.32]  significantly more it's like it
[2736.32 --> 2737.56]  actually made like a very
[2737.56 --> 2740.84]  noticeable impact life's like a
[2740.84 --> 2742.14]  little bit more chill when you're
[2742.14 --> 2745.76]  just like actually no i'm not
[2745.76 --> 2747.32]  going to consume this media or
[2747.32 --> 2748.72]  information or newsfeed or
[2748.72 --> 2750.22]  whatever it's just like not i'll
[2750.22 --> 2751.58]  chill i'm trying to do more of
[2751.58 --> 2753.02]  those like you know the classic
[2753.02 --> 2755.04]  like uh you have to wait in this
[2755.04 --> 2756.10]  area so you just start like
[2756.10 --> 2758.08]  reading the signs or whatever i'm
[2758.08 --> 2759.06]  trying to do that a little bit
[2759.06 --> 2759.36]  more
[2759.36 --> 2762.54]  oh just like no like what i would
[2762.54 --> 2764.68]  have done however long ago is go
[2764.68 --> 2766.22]  to my google newsfeed and just start
[2766.22 --> 2767.10]  scrolling through stuff or
[2767.10 --> 2768.52]  whatever and i'll still do it
[2768.52 --> 2770.02]  sometimes but i try to like
[2770.02 --> 2771.64]  consciously be like no i just
[2771.64 --> 2774.18]  i can i can stay out for now
[2774.18 --> 2777.58]  um my google newsfeed is um
[2777.58 --> 2780.08]  because and the way that i
[2780.08 --> 2781.32]  described it in a conversation i
[2781.32 --> 2783.06]  had recently was there's a
[2783.06 --> 2785.28]  multi-billion dollar industry
[2785.28 --> 2788.08]  that is based around just
[2788.08 --> 2790.82]  dominating your mind and getting
[2790.82 --> 2793.32]  you to do this thing that is good
[2793.32 --> 2796.44]  for various companies the
[2796.44 --> 2798.44]  corporations man but yeah to a
[2798.44 --> 2799.48]  certain degree but like actually
[2799.48 --> 2801.96]  yeah so you should consider that
[2801.96 --> 2804.92]  and not just play into it 100% of
[2804.92 --> 2807.78]  the time um and you know maybe you
[2807.78 --> 2808.92]  want to play into it sometimes
[2808.92 --> 2810.22]  because it tickles your little gooey
[2810.22 --> 2810.56]  brain
[2810.56 --> 2812.60]  um but i think sometimes you should
[2812.60 --> 2814.02]  fight against it a little bit mine's
[2814.02 --> 2816.44]  not too bad i definitely get too much
[2816.44 --> 2817.42]  american politics
[2817.42 --> 2820.96]  um something something oval office
[2820.96 --> 2824.00]  recordings uh unify rgb lighting
[2824.00 --> 2826.00]  uh something something impeachment
[2826.00 --> 2828.36]  intel unveils ai chip to compete with
[2828.36 --> 2830.96]  nvidia eight channel memory on wrx
[2830.96 --> 2834.42]  whatever is faster uh seagate has a
[2834.42 --> 2835.68]  hard drive that's not supposed to
[2835.68 --> 2837.24]  exist linux patch drop support for
[2837.24 --> 2839.76]  17 year old intel thing uh auto spill
[2839.76 --> 2841.14]  credential leak and android password
[2841.14 --> 2843.64]  managers tesla cyber truck crumple zones
[2843.64 --> 2845.68]  pc memory is about to double in capacity
[2845.68 --> 2847.84]  sales of bc homes you can really tell
[2847.84 --> 2849.48]  what i what i pay attention to
[2849.48 --> 2851.24]  and i've talked to you about this
[2851.24 --> 2854.90]  before but like i think that with a
[2854.90 --> 2857.62]  little bit of discipline we can create
[2857.62 --> 2860.48]  you can like a google news feed like i
[2860.48 --> 2862.40]  have had to i think it takes a lot of
[2862.40 --> 2864.42]  discipline personally i have had to try
[2864.42 --> 2865.52]  because every once in a while they'll
[2865.52 --> 2867.06]  try and get me back into it yeah and
[2867.06 --> 2870.38]  i have tried very hard to not click on
[2870.38 --> 2874.10]  anything star wars because it usually
[2874.10 --> 2877.36]  just annoys me and is just like some
[2877.36 --> 2879.70]  stupid nonsense ai written article or
[2879.70 --> 2881.00]  whatever so it usually just sucks
[2881.00 --> 2883.36]  anyway um and it gives me it gives me
[2883.36 --> 2885.06]  no satisfaction it doesn't help me at
[2885.06 --> 2886.36]  work it doesn't help me in my personal
[2886.36 --> 2890.28]  life whereas most of my stuff is pretty
[2890.28 --> 2893.24]  tech these days chips act uh steam trolls
[2893.24 --> 2897.12]  cheaters rising 8000 g nvidia ceo at an
[2897.12 --> 2899.08]  all-hands meeting intel launches core
[2899.08 --> 2901.34]  ultra 3d printer new matter pneumatic
[2901.34 --> 2902.86]  actuator like i
[2902.86 --> 2908.52]  it's hard i think i broke mine uh at one
[2908.52 --> 2909.90]  point in time i decided that the way i
[2909.90 --> 2911.66]  wanted to train it was to just tell it
[2911.66 --> 2913.20]  all the times that i didn't like
[2913.20 --> 2914.16]  something or didn't want to see
[2914.16 --> 2916.82]  something oh i never did that was bad
[2916.82 --> 2918.68]  you should not do that by the way no
[2918.68 --> 2919.94]  because it doesn't know what you don't
[2919.94 --> 2920.56]  like about it
[2920.56 --> 2924.68]  yeah and and i think also it will see
[2924.68 --> 2926.52]  that you don't like all of these things
[2926.52 --> 2930.36]  and just start guessing really sporadically
[2930.36 --> 2932.62]  so like at one point i showed i showed
[2932.62 --> 2933.68]  emma this i think i've talked to you
[2933.68 --> 2935.10]  about it at one point in time it decided
[2935.10 --> 2936.46]  that i was interested in some country
[2936.46 --> 2939.34]  singer i had never heard of i never
[2939.34 --> 2941.70]  clicked on any of them and for at least
[2941.70 --> 2943.44]  a week it was every second article was
[2943.44 --> 2946.06]  just like this is the shirt they wore like
[2946.06 --> 2948.46]  just anything it could possibly think of
[2948.46 --> 2950.46]  of this like one person i had never
[2950.46 --> 2952.30]  heard of before it's amazing how quickly
[2952.30 --> 2954.42]  he led astray i clicked on one stupid
[2954.42 --> 2956.26]  thing about megan markle at one point
[2956.26 --> 2958.58]  okay and all of a sudden like half my
[2958.58 --> 2960.28]  feed was just like whoa you're really
[2960.28 --> 2963.02]  into this kate middleton and harry styles
[2963.02 --> 2965.70]  or whatever the other harry is no sorry
[2965.70 --> 2967.18]  he's a singer it doesn't matter the point
[2967.18 --> 2969.44]  is uh yeah it was just full of that and
[2969.44 --> 2973.00]  then another really funny one was i um i
[2973.00 --> 2974.50]  was looking for a behind the scenes of
[2974.50 --> 2977.84]  something and i searched for it and i
[2977.84 --> 2981.20]  was like oh bts has a totally different
[2981.20 --> 2983.70]  meaning now because of the the korean mega
[2983.70 --> 2987.94]  oh yeah yeah right um group are they a
[2987.94 --> 2989.44]  band do they play instrument i don't
[2989.44 --> 2991.20]  know it doesn't matter the point is jimin's
[2991.20 --> 2994.20]  the best i guess or something oh boy oh
[2994.20 --> 2997.84]  what's it are you a jimin fan
[2997.84 --> 3004.52]  cool um the point is i i clicked one
[3004.52 --> 3006.48]  because i was like curious it's like oh
[3006.48 --> 3009.94]  yeah okay oh no and then oh man oh man
[3009.94 --> 3012.84]  like every time one of the every time
[3012.84 --> 3015.06]  one of them farted there was a google
[3015.06 --> 3017.96]  news alert for it i was like what even is
[3017.96 --> 3020.80]  this they changed their shirt like this
[3020.80 --> 3022.46]  is their favorite color like i don't
[3022.46 --> 3023.38]  fucking care
[3023.38 --> 3026.58]  yeah i was idly curious
[3026.58 --> 3029.56]  oh man oh
[3029.56 --> 3032.98]  anyway he was trying to get me he really
[3032.98 --> 3035.30]  emphasized to the if one of them farted
[3035.30 --> 3037.80]  things i was drinking water i'm gonna
[3037.80 --> 3040.46]  get you i'm gonna get you like shania
[3040.46 --> 3043.16]  twain i like i like felt it coming and
[3043.16 --> 3045.68]  was like no he's gonna say something i
[3045.68 --> 3047.40]  got a break i should have gone with
[3047.40 --> 3048.88]  queefed or something i would have gotten
[3048.88 --> 3049.50]  you with that
[3049.50 --> 3058.40]  probably oh boy um any what are we
[3058.40 --> 3060.14]  supposed to be talking about we were
[3060.14 --> 3060.92]  talking about
[3060.92 --> 3063.96]  no yeah we we were technically on the
[3063.96 --> 3065.64]  topic of you can't check who's monetized
[3065.64 --> 3067.72]  on youtube anymore and we somehow got
[3067.72 --> 3068.64]  here um
[3068.64 --> 3072.52]  yeah cool that relates to bts yeah why
[3072.52 --> 3074.78]  don't we explain what merch messages are
[3074.78 --> 3076.66]  and talk about some stuff going on on the
[3076.66 --> 3077.08]  store
[3077.08 --> 3079.84]  merch messages are the way to interact with
[3079.84 --> 3080.78]  the show
[3080.78 --> 3083.90]  don't send a twitch bit or you know
[3083.90 --> 3086.68]  youtube super chat or anything like that
[3086.68 --> 3088.96]  you want a merch message because we will
[3088.96 --> 3091.16]  either have our producer dan reply to
[3091.16 --> 3092.96]  you forward it to someone who can help
[3092.96 --> 3095.84]  you or put your message down here or
[3095.84 --> 3097.38]  forward it to us those are the four
[3097.38 --> 3098.72]  different things that can happen and if
[3098.72 --> 3100.48]  it gets forwarded to us we will address
[3100.48 --> 3101.92]  your comment on the show and if none of
[3101.92 --> 3103.26]  those things happen maybe there's a
[3103.26 --> 3104.92]  glitch in the matrix or whatever else
[3104.92 --> 3107.20]  hey at least you'll get some high quality
[3107.20 --> 3108.58]  merchandise in the mail
[3108.58 --> 3110.50]  yeah we do have a couple of things to
[3110.50 --> 3110.96]  talk about
[3110.96 --> 3113.92]  we've added a multi-pack combo discount
[3113.92 --> 3116.92]  for stick locks if you buy two packs you
[3116.92 --> 3118.96]  can get them for 24.99 and if you buy
[3118.96 --> 3121.84]  four packs you can get them for 39.99 if
[3121.84 --> 3124.84]  you want to equip a whole whack ton of
[3124.84 --> 3127.96]  your controllers also we have an update
[3127.96 --> 3130.60]  for you guys on the backpack dual layer
[3130.60 --> 3133.54]  warranty issue our team is working
[3133.54 --> 3135.22]  through the final details and we'll have
[3135.22 --> 3137.44]  something out to all buyers early next
[3137.44 --> 3139.24]  week keep an eye out for that if you've
[3139.24 --> 3140.68]  purchased a backpack before december
[3140.68 --> 3142.72]  9th we appreciate your patience this is a
[3142.72 --> 3144.72]  big task and we want to ensure it's done
[3144.72 --> 3147.04]  right something that this update
[3147.04 --> 3149.68]  doesn't include but I feel very strongly
[3149.68 --> 3151.12]  needs to be done so I'm just going to
[3151.12 --> 3152.74]  say it now so that it's in the public
[3152.74 --> 3155.50]  record is even if you buy one after
[3155.50 --> 3157.48]  december 9th if you have a single layer
[3157.48 --> 3160.00]  regular backpack this doesn't apply to
[3160.00 --> 3162.40]  the luxe the the apple leather is so
[3162.40 --> 3164.80]  thick we a never plan to put a single
[3164.80 --> 3166.48]  layer and be probably couldn't if we
[3166.48 --> 3167.68]  tried like the sewing would be
[3167.68 --> 3170.62]  impossible but anyway if you bought one
[3170.62 --> 3172.48]  after december 9th that has a single
[3172.48 --> 3175.90]  layer I don't think there's eligibility
[3175.90 --> 3178.78]  for the $25 credit because now the
[3178.78 --> 3180.22]  messaging has been corrected on the site
[3180.22 --> 3181.90]  and there's no miscommunication about it
[3181.90 --> 3186.80]  but the virtual second layer warranty
[3186.80 --> 3189.58]  where if it wears through you know
[3189.58 --> 3192.28]  because of anything other than you know
[3192.28 --> 3194.86]  obvious intentional damage at our
[3194.86 --> 3197.14]  discretion you're on a live show you
[3197.14 --> 3201.16]  decide to cut it open yeah so we will
[3201.16 --> 3202.58]  we'll we'll take care of you there's
[3202.58 --> 3206.08]  there's a virtual second layer and and
[3206.08 --> 3207.40]  we're gonna make sure we get that
[3207.40 --> 3208.74]  updated to everyone so if you buy a
[3208.74 --> 3211.12]  backpack today and the bottom wears
[3211.12 --> 3213.26]  through you know with natural wear and
[3213.26 --> 3215.08]  tear as part of our limited lifetime
[3215.08 --> 3217.50]  warranty we will we will make sure
[3217.50 --> 3219.82]  there's a carve out for that we have a
[3219.82 --> 3223.00]  new newsletter yeah precision
[3223.00 --> 3226.28]  screwdriver leak and update yeah
[3226.28 --> 3229.06]  interesting also there's a newsletter
[3229.06 --> 3230.98]  update we're gonna delay publishing of
[3230.98 --> 3232.50]  our newsletters to the blog by about a
[3232.50 --> 3233.84]  week from the time they're sent out to
[3233.84 --> 3234.94]  the email list so if you want the
[3234.94 --> 3236.76]  latest from LTT store make sure you
[3236.76 --> 3238.44]  sign up for our newsletter at the footer
[3238.44 --> 3241.06]  on the site so that's uh if you just
[3241.06 --> 3243.62]  kind of scroll down right there it's
[3243.62 --> 3246.72]  really hard to find put your email
[3246.72 --> 3248.84]  there the text is almost so big that I
[3248.84 --> 3250.84]  legitimately do kind of find it hard to
[3250.84 --> 3252.26]  find you're the part of your brain that
[3252.26 --> 3254.80]  ignores ads is like huh yeah might be
[3254.80 --> 3256.62]  there's a lot of really good stuff in
[3256.62 --> 3260.20]  here including a ton of really
[3260.20 --> 3262.72]  interesting looks at the evolution of
[3262.72 --> 3265.08]  this product as it's been developed
[3265.08 --> 3267.88]  talking about materials why we bothered
[3267.88 --> 3271.04]  to make one this is so cool all the
[3271.04 --> 3272.92]  different variations of ceramic and
[3272.92 --> 3274.90]  ceramic steel hybrid bearings we found
[3274.90 --> 3278.14]  one that spins yeah that's right we
[3278.14 --> 3279.70]  measured this one and your mileage may
[3279.70 --> 3281.86]  vary but we found one that we were able
[3281.86 --> 3285.04]  to get to spin by hand for 70 seconds oh
[3285.04 --> 3287.92]  my god just by giving it a little spin
[3287.92 --> 3291.34]  like that pretty wild our end caps are
[3291.34 --> 3293.32]  going to be interchangeable so you can
[3293.32 --> 3295.00]  swap them out with a 10 millimeter wrench
[3295.00 --> 3297.04]  we're going to have different sizes and
[3297.04 --> 3300.40]  shapes check this out yeah buddy so if you
[3300.40 --> 3303.22]  want you know you like it to you like to
[3303.22 --> 3305.20]  kind of palm it or you know you like the
[3305.20 --> 3308.56]  flat top we're going to have bit storage in
[3308.56 --> 3311.08]  the handle which is pretty cool here's a
[3311.08 --> 3312.52]  lot of different variations of that
[3312.52 --> 3314.74]  anyway you're going to definitely want to
[3314.74 --> 3316.18]  read through that a lot of really cool
[3316.18 --> 3321.04]  details from the team and oh oh so when
[3321.04 --> 3322.72]  can I get one we're still a few months
[3322.72 --> 3324.46]  away apparently I'm reading this update
[3324.46 --> 3326.90]  alongside you guys planning to offer a
[3326.90 --> 3328.30]  unique launch experience for this
[3328.30 --> 3330.10]  product once we offer a public
[3330.10 --> 3331.72]  notification signup page for launch there
[3331.72 --> 3332.92]  may be an opportunity to purchase a
[3332.92 --> 3334.30]  limited number of pre-launch drivers oh
[3334.30 --> 3336.90]  yeah we have talked about this so like with
[3336.90 --> 3341.32]  the screwdriver we want to backorder this
[3341.32 --> 3343.46]  one to get an idea of what demand is
[3343.46 --> 3344.74]  going to be like and to help with cash
[3344.74 --> 3347.56]  flow so we're not gonna we're not gonna
[3347.56 --> 3350.04]  do pre-orders because this is technically
[3350.04 --> 3351.56]  like a new product I think we did pre
[3351.56 --> 3352.68]  orders on the luxe because it's a
[3352.68 --> 3354.52]  material change I think we've done
[3354.52 --> 3356.12]  pre-orders on some of the screwdriver
[3356.12 --> 3358.48]  colorways and stuff like that this is a
[3358.48 --> 3360.08]  very new product so we're not going to
[3360.08 --> 3361.54]  expect people to order it sight unseen
[3361.54 --> 3363.54]  doing a pop-up or something and I think
[3363.54 --> 3365.24]  we're it's either online or in person
[3365.24 --> 3367.40]  we're not sure but we're basically going
[3367.40 --> 3369.62]  to sell some of them give people an
[3369.62 --> 3371.42]  opportunity to share their thoughts
[3371.42 --> 3374.42]  after having real customer hands-on with
[3374.42 --> 3376.46]  it and then at that point we're going to
[3376.46 --> 3379.34]  open up back orders which are I mean
[3379.34 --> 3382.04]  essentially you know a pre-order in the
[3382.04 --> 3383.84]  sense that the production is not done yet
[3383.84 --> 3385.34]  but you know it will be we'll have we'll
[3385.34 --> 3387.02]  have done some mass production and
[3387.02 --> 3390.20]  demonstrated what the product will be we're
[3390.20 --> 3393.86]  hoping that we will have details for that in
[3393.86 --> 3398.60]  early 2024 I do wonder if at some point
[3398.60 --> 3402.88]  people have made it very clear they're
[3402.88 --> 3405.50]  like yeah you know you shouldn't do
[3405.50 --> 3407.92]  pre-orders but also I'd love to be able
[3407.92 --> 3409.22]  to pre-order one I'd be the first one to
[3409.22 --> 3410.44]  send my money because I just want to have
[3410.44 --> 3412.74]  it right away I don't know at some point
[3412.74 --> 3415.06]  maybe we just maybe we just drop the
[3415.06 --> 3416.34]  whole thing and are just like yeah we're
[3416.34 --> 3418.26]  doing pre-orders for it don't don't
[3418.26 --> 3421.84]  pre-order it but you can yeah I I don't
[3421.84 --> 3424.56]  know man people want it it kind of feels
[3424.56 --> 3428.70]  like one of those things where like you
[3428.70 --> 3429.96]  know everyone's mad about micro
[3429.96 --> 3434.14]  transactions in games but they want it
[3434.14 --> 3437.58]  the market shows I don't know like I can
[3437.58 --> 3439.58]  I can like is there is there really is
[3441.18 --> 3444.36]  the is there like what's the point of
[3444.36 --> 3447.34]  not letting them I guess well I think the
[3447.34 --> 3452.50]  point is that there's okay like telling
[3452.50 --> 3454.24]  them like we don't even think you should
[3454.24 --> 3458.20]  I love analogies okay right so let's
[3458.20 --> 3460.96]  take let's take one of one of you know
[3460.96 --> 3463.48]  society's favorite bad guys right big
[3463.48 --> 3466.06]  tobacco so I'm a tobacco company I
[3466.06 --> 3468.52]  release an ad because for some reason
[3468.52 --> 3470.06]  I'm allowed to run TV ads again or
[3470.06 --> 3472.54]  something sure so I run I run an ad on
[3472.54 --> 3476.92]  TV that is that basically says you
[3476.92 --> 3479.86]  shouldn't smoke it is really harmful
[3479.86 --> 3483.82]  and causes health effects that are very
[3483.82 --> 3486.52]  but then you sell deleterious to you
[3486.52 --> 3489.06]  yeah that's dramatically a disaster the
[3489.06 --> 3490.80]  point is I basically say smoking's bad
[3490.80 --> 3493.34]  don't buy cigarettes but then I'm still
[3493.34 --> 3496.50]  selling them which in a way is extra bad
[3496.50 --> 3498.74]  because I extra super know that they're
[3498.74 --> 3500.88]  definitely bad yeah I have a counter for
[3500.88 --> 3503.94]  this sure I think the pre-ordering of a
[3503.94 --> 3507.12]  product is
[3508.12 --> 3510.00]  let is contentious the right word is
[3510.00 --> 3514.08]  less contentious than smoking and like
[3514.08 --> 3515.66]  an example that I would give is I tell
[3515.66 --> 3518.00]  everyone not to pre-order games yeah I
[3518.00 --> 3520.06]  have definitely pre-ordered game me too I
[3520.06 --> 3522.20]  have pre-order games since I told people
[3522.20 --> 3524.26]  not to pre-order games yep me too I I
[3524.26 --> 3526.60]  pre-ordered Bill Watterson's quote
[3526.60 --> 3532.20]  unquote graphic novel and it was wish you
[3532.20 --> 3533.98]  waited for the reviews on that one no
[3533.98 --> 3535.98]  because I would have bought it anyways I
[3535.98 --> 3537.46]  would have I would have just given him
[3537.46 --> 3539.30]  the 20 bucks yeah I would have rather
[3539.30 --> 3541.88]  just him not bothered to produce this is
[3541.88 --> 3544.84]  like like waste Starfield was a trash heap I
[3544.84 --> 3547.06]  was gonna buy it no matter what yeah it
[3547.06 --> 3548.72]  didn't matter if every reviewer on the
[3548.72 --> 3550.72]  internet was like this is trash Bethesda
[3550.72 --> 3553.92]  was my favorite game company for years when I
[3553.92 --> 3558.18]  was a kid I'm gonna buy this freaking game I
[3558.18 --> 3560.16]  feel like people struggle with analogies
[3560.16 --> 3562.98]  sometimes hmm did someone point that
[3562.98 --> 3564.90]  this is twitch chat no no it's so the LTT
[3564.90 --> 3567.72]  screwdriver is as addictive as tobacco no
[3567.72 --> 3569.86]  that's not the point the point is not the
[3569.86 --> 3572.94]  specifics of you know how harmful the
[3572.94 --> 3574.54]  thing is or whatever else the point is
[3574.54 --> 3576.84]  just the the potential for perceived
[3576.84 --> 3582.84]  hypocrisy that is a fidget point so maybe
[3582.84 --> 3589.46]  this is a joke oh man but yeah I don't
[3589.46 --> 3591.12]  know I don't I don't feel like pre-ordering
[3591.12 --> 3594.74]  is as is I don't know I feel like we can
[3594.74 --> 3599.00]  say like in general you you know probably
[3599.00 --> 3601.66]  shouldn't do pre-orders but like I don't
[3601.66 --> 3604.90]  think it's as bad as people smoking I don't
[3604.90 --> 3606.82]  think it's as bad for you as people smoking
[3606.82 --> 3610.42]  I think it's a really dangerous slippery
[3610.42 --> 3613.36]  slope of morality and ethics I mean I
[3613.36 --> 3615.20]  think that I could easily rationalize to
[3615.20 --> 3616.50]  myself that there's nothing wrong with
[3616.50 --> 3617.80]  us taking pre-orders on this product
[3617.80 --> 3619.80]  because a it's gonna be great and be if
[3619.80 --> 3622.00]  it's not we got you trust me bro yeah
[3622.00 --> 3626.86]  exactly but I think that that's a dangerous
[3626.86 --> 3631.42]  path to hubris right I'm not gonna make a
[3631.42 --> 3634.74]  mistake and if I do I'll fix it and so
[3634.74 --> 3639.12]  what's the problem well the problem is if
[3639.12 --> 3642.78]  any of that fails because there's what
[3642.78 --> 3646.04]  are this what are the safety checks and I
[3646.04 --> 3652.58]  know I'm not gonna go there so I don't
[3652.58 --> 3654.10]  know I think well we'll give it some more
[3654.10 --> 3656.82]  thought I mean with this look my point is
[3656.82 --> 3661.90]  it's a ton of work for us to red hot rush
[3661.90 --> 3665.80]  hyper expensive a small batch do a pre-sale
[3665.80 --> 3668.68]  event or like an early sale like an early
[3668.68 --> 3671.88]  access event for a physical product those
[3671.88 --> 3675.78]  units are super expensive the marketing and
[3675.78 --> 3679.16]  the event management of all of this is super
[3679.16 --> 3681.76]  expensive super time-consuming and at the
[3681.76 --> 3685.22]  end of the day it changes nothing about what
[3685.22 --> 3689.20]  the final product is it telegraphs confidence
[3689.20 --> 3691.12]  so you could see it as kind of like an
[3691.12 --> 3693.42]  effective marketing tool in that way but
[3693.42 --> 3696.20]  then looking back at the screwdriver launch I
[3696.20 --> 3697.94]  don't think people took it seriously until
[3697.94 --> 3700.14]  project farm ultimately came out and gave it
[3700.14 --> 3703.24]  the stamp of approval anyway so then what
[3703.24 --> 3706.16]  did it matter what our confidence was or what
[3706.16 --> 3708.86]  the reactions of the live buyers at the show
[3708.86 --> 3711.92]  were if at the end of if at the end of the
[3711.92 --> 3715.90]  day people were just going to is that the
[3715.90 --> 3718.22]  solution do you see do you seed it to you
[3718.22 --> 3719.74]  can't do that with all products though no and
[3719.74 --> 3721.68]  that and Todd doesn't want us to see them
[3721.68 --> 3723.74]  products he buys everything right like he'll
[3723.74 --> 3726.70]  he'll he'll pay his money early so he'll
[3726.70 --> 3730.02]  accept that benefit in the form of in a way
[3730.02 --> 3732.80]  special treatment but at the end of the day
[3732.80 --> 3734.90]  from his perspective and I agree with him
[3734.90 --> 3738.28]  from his perspective he's just a customer
[3738.28 --> 3743.74]  who paid his $69.99 nice and got a screwdriver
[3743.74 --> 3746.78]  and so yeah there are definitely monetary
[3746.78 --> 3748.96]  benefits to him getting early access to it
[3748.96 --> 3751.20]  in that he can go live with his video
[3751.20 --> 3752.84]  earlier than other people who didn't get
[3752.84 --> 3757.56]  early access but I think we have enough of
[3757.56 --> 3761.00]  his track record to go guys that's probably
[3761.00 --> 3763.38]  not it that's that's probably not the issue I
[3763.38 --> 3767.20]  think that he genuinely is a sincere guy and
[3767.20 --> 3769.18]  wants to get information to the audience in
[3769.18 --> 3771.04]  a timely manner so that they can make an
[3771.04 --> 3772.70]  informed purchase decision I don't think
[3772.70 --> 3776.26]  this is about him just getting more views
[3776.26 --> 3778.02]  yeah I think he could have released his
[3778.02 --> 3780.24]  video a month after the release of the
[3780.24 --> 3781.86]  product still across and it still would have
[3781.86 --> 3784.34]  gotten millions of views yeah so we might as
[3784.34 --> 3786.02]  well just have it out there earlier and
[3786.02 --> 3787.88]  realistically if another media outlet came
[3787.88 --> 3790.32]  to us and was like hey we're really big in
[3790.32 --> 3792.54]  the you know tool space or whatever can we get
[3792.54 --> 3794.44]  we I don't see why we wouldn't give them the
[3794.44 --> 3795.98]  same treatment if they had the same kind of
[3795.98 --> 3797.56]  reach as Todd though I don't know who does but
[3797.56 --> 3800.08]  even if they had even less than Todd I think
[3800.08 --> 3802.12]  that I don't think that that's some kind of
[3802.12 --> 3804.62]  weird advantage and I don't think that there's
[3805.44 --> 3809.86]  inherently corruption there I think if you have
[3809.86 --> 3813.78]  good people who are honest and working in
[3813.78 --> 3815.76]  good faith there's nothing wrong with getting
[3815.76 --> 3817.66]  early access to a product and paying for it
[3817.66 --> 3819.74]  early and I think it's kind of silly to to
[3819.74 --> 3822.84]  think that it is it was it was amazing how many
[3822.84 --> 3825.62]  people went from and I noticed usernames that
[3825.62 --> 3828.02]  were the same oh yeah how many people went from
[3828.02 --> 3831.82]  this thing is shit until Todd from project farm
[3831.82 --> 3834.62]  says it's good because he has impeccable
[3834.62 --> 3837.84]  integrity and who immediately flipped they
[3837.84 --> 3842.26]  couldn't their brains couldn't process that it
[3842.26 --> 3845.08]  could actually just be a good product and so
[3845.08 --> 3848.52]  they went straight to Todd's crap Todd's a shill how
[3848.52 --> 3853.72]  much did LTT pay him oh man oh man where is your goal post
[3853.72 --> 3857.12]  yeah exactly keep moving it man just keep just keep
[3857.12 --> 3859.76]  walking keep walking until you reach the nearest
[3859.76 --> 3862.70]  ocean put the post at the bottom of it let me know how
[3862.70 --> 3865.32]  it goes channel that channel that prehistoric human
[3865.32 --> 3868.90]  hunting energy yeah just go anyway
[3868.90 --> 3871.76]  what are we supposed to be talking about yeah we're
[3871.76 --> 3873.68]  supposed to do a couple merch messages all you got to do is
[3873.68 --> 3876.88]  head to lgdstore.com we do any of them pick up no no not even a little
[3876.88 --> 3880.92]  pick up some stick locks or pick up the screwdriver you know whatever the case
[3880.92 --> 3883.30]  maybe you've got the noxian screwdrivers on there now those are doing
[3883.30 --> 3886.10]  really well people are super stoked on them yeah
[3886.10 --> 3892.78]  um and then in the cart in the cart uh there'll be a box you can enter your
[3892.78 --> 3895.82]  merch message and it'll go here all right Dan do you want to hit us with a
[3895.82 --> 3897.78]  couple merch messages yeah sure first one here
[3897.78 --> 3902.04]  hello WAN show Linus hello with the go xlr support gone
[3902.04 --> 3906.36]  what xlr would you replace yours with or recommend I'm just gonna keep using it
[3906.36 --> 3909.80]  until they pry it from my cold dead hands I really like it it just works
[3909.80 --> 3914.30]  eventually it'll die and it hasn't yet mind you with the way that microsoft
[3914.30 --> 3919.82]  changes windows so relatively little from iteration to iteration these days
[3919.82 --> 3923.08]  it is possible that my drivers for the go xlr will work
[3923.08 --> 3927.40]  for a very very long time like until we get another
[3927.40 --> 3931.92]  you know fundamental retooling of how audio is handled in windows like we did
[3931.92 --> 3937.36]  from XP to Vista I think it is quite possible that with the usual hackery
[3937.36 --> 3942.22]  right where you force the install or you you go into whatever the file is and you
[3942.22 --> 3946.74]  like add your version of windows to the supported OS's so that it bypasses the
[3946.74 --> 3951.36]  compatibility check or whatever else I suspect it'll work for a long time I
[3951.36 --> 3954.40]  didn't know this will the beast and full plane chat so there's a community go xlr
[3954.40 --> 3959.92]  software version nice that's pretty crazy I I'm a little my the first go xlr I got
[3959.92 --> 3964.78]  bricked itself within a week so I don't know how confident I am in the thing
[3964.78 --> 3968.96]  living but my sample size is very small yeah and I've got at least one backup one
[3968.96 --> 3973.76]  kicking around somewhere so I'm good there you go I'm I'm one of those people
[3973.76 --> 3978.36]  where if I find something I like I make sure that I've started converting to that
[3978.36 --> 3984.68]  it's a good way to go I just I think part of it is just getting older maybe I just I
[3984.68 --> 3989.84]  for me I spend I I will put way too much time and energy and and whatnot into
[3989.84 --> 3995.08]  researching the purchasing decision that like if I'm very confident this thing
[3995.08 --> 3998.64]  like I spend a lot of time doing that I get it I keep it for a certain amount of
[3998.64 --> 4002.02]  time and I'm like yeah this is like amazing I'm like however many months into
[4002.02 --> 4005.80]  this and I still love this thing yeah okay let's just go get more because I
[4005.80 --> 4010.28]  don't want to do that again like and if it's like a tool or something like this
[4010.28 --> 4015.12]  go xlr thing like whatever this this thing that it does hasn't really evolved
[4015.12 --> 4020.14]  all that much and we might get more kilohertz maybe or more bits or whatever
[4020.14 --> 4024.58]  but at the end of the day do I care about that it's gonna get crushed by
[4024.58 --> 4028.78]  whatever it might have it might have more vibrant RGB discord's gonna take it
[4028.78 --> 4032.88]  just go well I mean garbage in garbage out you put in something better
[4032.88 --> 4037.76]  discord's crushing it will be less worse but but but but even so like if I if
[4037.76 --> 4041.34]  there's something that I really like honestly guys I just I don't feel that
[4041.34 --> 4045.42]  strongly incentivized to change it and I think part of that is just how
[4045.42 --> 4049.08]  incremental the changes have gotten so you'll have a new phone that comes out
[4049.08 --> 4056.70]  and it's like marginally faster and I don't know it has some like I'm just trying
[4056.70 --> 4061.10]  to think of it has like another camera on it or whatever but they removed your
[4061.10 --> 4065.96]  headphone jack and you're just like well fuck right that sucks and so many
[4065.96 --> 4070.40]  things are like that these days where if I'm happy with my go xlr and some new
[4070.40 --> 4074.54]  one comes out that has some just bullshit that I don't care about but I give up
[4074.54 --> 4079.52]  something about it that I liked and that thing I about it that I like could be as
[4079.52 --> 4083.98]  meaningless as that I've already set up the profile and already adjusted my gain
[4083.98 --> 4089.14]  for where I like to put my microphone like that eight minutes of going through a
[4089.14 --> 4095.02]  setup wizard could be could be the difference for me yeah compared to the
[4095.02 --> 4099.04]  meaningless things that they've improved that don't matter to me have you used
[4099.04 --> 4105.52]  the road casters no because that's that I believe these started being a thing
[4105.52 --> 4109.18]  fairly recently or at least I only discovered them fairly recently I think
[4109.18 --> 4114.70]  they're relatively similar priced like there's one on excellent photo dot CA
[4114.70 --> 4121.22]  right now that's for 450 CAD yeah these are Canadian dollars guys by the way so
[4121.22 --> 4125.80]  it's like plus 30 plus percent go XLRs are crazy expensive too yeah that's true
[4125.80 --> 4134.80]  like they they were so if you want your hyper expensive XLR interface with RGB on it
[4134.80 --> 4140.44]  option there is still things like that at least from road I know nothing about
[4140.44 --> 4144.82]  them I've never used them but I've heard of them I've heard good things I don't
[4144.82 --> 4151.62]  know though all I care about is my bleep button yeah I don't see one I see
[4151.62 --> 4155.44]  configurable yeah I'm sure you could do it yeah and I could I could probably
[4155.44 --> 4162.16]  figure this out but you have no reason to necessarily but I just I man I don't
[4162.16 --> 4165.70]  feel like it it's not something that excites me I would rather spend my energy
[4165.70 --> 4170.94]  on something that excites me like the the the the the energy that I feel when
[4170.94 --> 4175.78]  I'm playing around with cool tech that I care about is just so much greater
[4175.78 --> 4180.22]  does just no one but I've never actually heard of this website before so this
[4180.22 --> 4189.12]  isn't a recommendation but it's 449 discounted from 549 mm-hmm and if you buy
[4189.12 --> 4194.76]  it with these $260 headphones you get the headphones for free I don't know does
[4194.76 --> 4198.12]  no one buy this thing and they're just trying to like burn it down or what it's
[4198.12 --> 4201.60]  probably more to do with the fact that there is excellent margin in these
[4201.60 --> 4206.88]  products and yeah it's the holiday season so you're gonna see a lot of
[4206.88 --> 4210.42]  aggressive promos right now like we ran lots of stuff in our black Friday cyber
[4210.42 --> 4215.10]  Monday promos that sells yeah like it's it's not like we were desperate to get rid of
[4215.10 --> 4218.10]  it we did sell some stuff that we were desperate to get rid of hey go full
[4218.10 --> 4222.54]  transparency but yeah but we absolutely promote stuff that was moving great
[4222.54 --> 4225.84]  nothing wrong with that though necessarily it might be a great product you just
[4225.84 --> 4229.92]  order too many of it or whatever yeah or or we didn't we just put on a promo
[4229.92 --> 4233.46]  because we were like this is exciting yeah and so you can you can see stuff like
[4233.46 --> 4239.28]  that especially this time of year and I wouldn't necessarily read too much into it
[4239.28 --> 4244.00]  is all I'm trying to say apparently Jays two cents uses oh never mind they said
[4244.00 --> 4250.52]  they believe Jays two cents uses a road caster for RTFM not certain though sure yeah
[4250.52 --> 4256.92]  it does with a merge message hi DLL question for Linus did you learn ASL at some point I
[4256.92 --> 4263.28]  noticed some signs get it that you've learned some like sorry these keep shifting around
[4263.28 --> 4272.16]  like using ASL six or using spatial mapping when talking on the show yeah my my mom was a teacher
[4272.16 --> 4283.80]  of the deaf and she is hard of hearing and we were strongly encouraged to learn ASL we had a foster kid
[4283.80 --> 4292.48]  in our house for a number of years who was as far as I'm aware profoundly deaf like couldn't couldn't
[4292.48 --> 4298.80]  hear anything and so in order to communicate with him we were all encouraged to sign as much as
[4298.80 --> 4311.02]  possible at one point I was conversant enough that I managed to make my way through translation duties
[4311.02 --> 4317.26]  for my mom at a conference it just about killed my brain massive respect for interpreters they
[4317.26 --> 4324.52]  wow sometimes you have to kind of make stuff up on the fly right have you ever noticed
[4324.52 --> 4330.12]  well yeah I mean if a word doesn't exist in that sense so you're not making stuff up but you're
[4330.12 --> 4336.80]  making up a way of expressing it or or especially when you're you know okay let's say you're let's
[4336.80 --> 4340.60]  say you're interpreting for a government official and all of a sudden they start talking about defense
[4340.60 --> 4346.60]  or something like that and yeah I'm sorry the the the what spanker missile or what like
[4346.60 --> 4352.06]  uh yeah it can be extremely challenging I didn't even think about that that's got to be nuts yeah
[4352.06 --> 4357.22]  like lingo like interpreting at like a scientific conference holy crap right but accessibility matters
[4357.22 --> 4363.52]  so have you ever noticed that interpreters will tag out really frequently was a high mental strain
[4363.52 --> 4369.24]  it's extremely draining that makes sense I don't know if I have ever before or since
[4369.24 --> 4376.70]  slept as well as I did after the first day of that conference that's that's a this is an offshoot
[4376.70 --> 4383.26]  but uh do you know like chess is like high caloric burn like if you're good at chess you can actually
[4383.26 --> 4389.02]  be doing a lot of computation in your head it's quite high caloric burn because you're like really
[4389.02 --> 4392.70]  thinking so you're saying that's why I'm thin because I think a lot and my brain is powerful
[4392.70 --> 4396.88]  I might be part of it actually I we've talked about this it's probably more to do with the fact
[4396.88 --> 4403.94]  that I have ADHD and I'm a fidgeter and apparently that contributes a really big one actually way way
[4403.94 --> 4411.24]  more to your calorie burn than like your metabolism basically right like it's huge yeah I don't remember
[4411.24 --> 4425.40]  what it uh um anyway um yes I do often um exercise activity thermogenesis neat refers to a portion of
[4425.40 --> 4430.56]  daily energy expenditure resulting from spontaneous physical activity that is not specifically the
[4430.56 --> 4438.66]  result of voluntary exercise levels of neat range widely with variants of up to 2 000 kilocalories per day
[4438.66 --> 4445.96]  between two individuals of similar size like massively impactful like little fidgets all bouncing your
[4445.96 --> 4452.10]  knee little doing whatever it all counts everything counts so in response to your question yes I was
[4452.10 --> 4460.40]  reasonably proficient in ASL at some point I forget a lot um I know enough that you know when I when I'm at
[4460.40 --> 4467.80]  a family function and some of my family's um deaf friends are there I can check in you know hey how you
[4467.80 --> 4473.32]  doing and how are the kids and you know that kind of stuff but um I'm I'm at a point now where I've
[4473.32 --> 4481.22]  forgotten so much that while I will while I'll do little things like I will in conversation uh you
[4481.22 --> 4485.80]  know describing something that I saw I'll be like yeah so the person was walking and then the car like
[4485.80 --> 4490.68]  just missed them and I'll realize oh yeah this is a car to me this is probably not a car to you
[4490.68 --> 4503.50]  oh interesting and when I gesture I do so as you noticed um accurately because I am a lot of sign
[4503.50 --> 4512.02]  language is not the words but is the relative positions of things so something that trips me up
[4512.02 --> 4523.22]  a lot is if you're talking to me and you say um yeah turn right and you gesture vaguely
[4523.22 --> 4531.66]  I'll turn left because I wasn't listening I was watching and that's something that I'm
[4532.38 --> 4538.28]  probably I guess probably more attuned to than most people so yeah so Yvonne and I will have
[4538.28 --> 4544.18]  conversations where she'll go uh I'll go hey where are my keys and she'll go they're over there
[4544.18 --> 4550.66]  and to her she was going this way and to me she pointed upstairs so I will waste 10 minutes looking
[4550.66 --> 4555.58]  for my keys and I'll be like hey I can't find them and she'll be like they're right where I told you
[4555.58 --> 4565.34]  and I'm like no you point you point it up that that matters uh yeah it's
[4565.34 --> 4572.90]  we're good but it's definitely something that has come up more than a few times everyone has
[4572.90 --> 4579.68]  their things um anyway one of my favorite one of my favorite signs by the way is not a real sign
[4579.68 --> 4584.38]  it's just like uh it's like a it's like a slang thing uh the real sign for understand is like this
[4584.38 --> 4590.74]  and it's kind of like um like like lights flashing uh looks like this so you kind of like you create
[4590.74 --> 4596.92]  manually sensations right so yeah it's it's like a light bulb yeah I understand um but but my but
[4596.92 --> 4605.80]  like one of my favorite things ever is uh this also means understand so the person standing oh my god
[4605.80 --> 4612.56]  it's like yeah what about I think you've shown me that one before yeah what about uh the milk uh what's
[4612.56 --> 4618.06]  the sign for milk and then milking no no do milk and then move it past your face what do you hold
[4618.06 --> 4621.30]  on what do you all right hold on hold on what are you even talking about do the sign for milk
[4621.30 --> 4625.52]  and then move it past in front of your face it's pasteurized milk
[4625.52 --> 4631.56]  all right that's the only that's the only asl joke i know
[4631.56 --> 4644.56]  all right all right wow sheesh yeah so do you know why this is three
[4644.56 --> 4652.82]  no because this is w uh yeah so it's little things like that that yeah people pick up from time to
[4652.82 --> 4659.28]  time uh all right so someone asked um sorry this is actually fairly important uh tools of pwnage asked
[4659.28 --> 4665.76]  what's the sign for no cap for real for real bussin i have no idea what the f**k that means
[4665.76 --> 4674.06]  signs closing the laptop it's just amazing what is bussin again i can't remember i actually don't
[4674.06 --> 4680.50]  know it's some zoomer term i don't know i think good i think this is good is that right i think it's
[4680.50 --> 4688.08]  good okay really really good so no and no cap is not lying no lie for real for real is just like
[4688.08 --> 4696.96]  yeah yeah yeah and then good yeah so i'm not lying i'm being honest and it's good like or like like
[4696.96 --> 4708.84]  really um yeah i mean other than just like literally like is there is there a lie and not lie yeah i think
[4708.84 --> 4714.88]  this is lie i can't remember uh it's it's been a long time like i i would just i'll just say completely
[4714.88 --> 4721.44]  the wrong word sometimes okay so that's another example so like like interchange this is like that's
[4722.32 --> 4724.32]  so i i do it often um
[4726.80 --> 4730.96]  a lot of them i don't know that they're oh no yeah so it's like this yeah so i was i i forget what this
[4730.96 --> 4736.80]  is but it's something that is lie um yeah so i don't know it's just little things there's there's a lot of
[4736.80 --> 4741.28]  stuff where i won't necessarily recognize that you're doing sign language because i don't know sign
[4741.28 --> 4747.28]  language so it's hard to recognize but a lot of it just makes a bunch of sense like you did the car
[4747.28 --> 4752.88]  one whatever that was yeah my brain doesn't go this is a car but i'm like okay clearly object we're
[4752.88 --> 4757.60]  discussing car this i'm now going to decide this is a car and then it does the thing it's like okay
[4757.60 --> 4759.52]  so i still understand everything that's happening
[4759.52 --> 4769.12]  you're just going to be able to do that from now on and i'm just going to burst into laughter
[4776.72 --> 4781.52]  the delivery of it was my favorite part just slight smile no other reaction
[4781.52 --> 4791.28]  okay hit us with one more dan oh yeah sure one sec um let's do this on hey linus have you played sea
[4791.28 --> 4796.48]  of stars yet i have yet to play it but i've been looking forward to it since you first talked about
[4796.48 --> 4804.32]  it on the wan show considering the size of the team it's an incredible achievement um i found the art
[4804.32 --> 4814.00]  the art to be mind-blowing um it's such a beautiful game the music is as good as the art it's it's
[4814.00 --> 4826.24]  absolutely incredible um i do not understand at all the praise for the combat i found it to be tedious
[4826.24 --> 4834.16]  and repetitive um i think that if i had maybe used some of the like the crutches the the modifiers
[4834.16 --> 4838.88]  that you can that you can activate uh maybe i would have found it easier but i wasn't looking
[4838.88 --> 4846.80]  for easy i like that's one of the things that i like to a degree about classic rpgs is is challenge
[4846.80 --> 4852.96]  in particularly boss fights um but in sea of stars i just found like kind of every encounter was
[4852.96 --> 4858.88]  started tedious and and there's something to be said for being able to get wiped at any moment like
[4858.88 --> 4868.48]  always kind of having that you know that thrill of that danger right um but i just yeah the combat is is
[4870.32 --> 4877.28]  it seemed really promising right at the beginning and then i kind of went oh that's as interesting
[4877.28 --> 4882.48]  as it gets and there it's an indie game you so you have to keep your expectations realistic but there
[4882.48 --> 4889.28]  wasn't enough play testing you'd have boss fights where they they have this mechanic where um the
[4889.28 --> 4895.68]  bosses will have like kind of a roulette thing and then you'll have to hit them with your pasties uh
[4895.68 --> 4902.40]  falling off over there oh sorry yeah you'll have a roulette thing and then it'll come up with you know
[4902.40 --> 4908.72]  a supposedly i guess randomized combination of elemental or attack types that you need to hit it with in order
[4908.72 --> 4914.64]  to prevent it from unleashing a bigger attack which is on the surface a pretty cool mechanic except that
[4914.64 --> 4922.08]  often very often you'd have like a two turn countdown timer and you'd have to hit it with
[4922.64 --> 4928.08]  three strikes of something that you only have two characters each of which can hit for one
[4928.72 --> 4932.56]  and you're just like well that's pretty stupid um
[4932.56 --> 4941.20]  um or or or you're just unlucky and that character you have one turn to do it and you could do it but
[4941.20 --> 4948.00]  you're just unlucky and they don't have any mp and so you can't do it so it's like oh okay well i was
[4948.00 --> 4954.16]  just wiped because i didn't have the clairvoyance to know that it was going to be that and in reality
[4954.16 --> 4959.36]  they're not random anyway um they're they're they're predetermined as far as i can tell like there's a
[4959.36 --> 4964.56]  a couple of different variants so once you kind of get into a rhythm where you where you know what
[4964.56 --> 4970.48]  it's going to be it's it's beatable but it's just tedious because the enemies have too many too many
[4970.48 --> 4977.44]  hit points once you understand the mechanic and have solved the puzzle uh it it shouldn't take a long
[4977.44 --> 4988.96]  time to finish a turn-based fight um and the other big one is that it's a really small world i didn't find
[4988.96 --> 4998.40]  i didn't find it that easy to get immersed in it there was no need to explore um there's a there's
[4998.40 --> 5003.04]  there's some exploration you can do basically like if i'm not going to spoil anything but there's kind
[5003.04 --> 5010.64]  of like a long tedious fetch quest where you can go look for all of some kind of collectible item
[5011.44 --> 5017.36]  and it does a thing that realistically i just looked up i was like okay what happens and then when i
[5017.36 --> 5023.28]  found out what happens i was like oh that's really stupid because um one of the best things about
[5023.28 --> 5025.52]  this game and its story um
[5029.28 --> 5036.72]  i i don't like it when storytellers chicken out uh i think that rowling chickened out when harry potter
[5036.72 --> 5043.36]  didn't die yeah he was a lamb raised for slaughter and then she didn't kill him it's like okay well
[5043.36 --> 5052.48]  that's stupid um you know you had an opportunity to to do something really emotionally impactful and
[5052.48 --> 5057.20]  you're like okay how about one of the one of the weasleys instead let's not go after one of the main
[5057.20 --> 5063.76]  three let's let's let's let's kill a weasley twin um yeah and i and you know i'm just i i think it i
[5063.76 --> 5071.68]  think it sucks i think that encanto is a beautiful movie with great music and amazing visuals and at the
[5071.68 --> 5078.24]  end spoiler alert i guess i don't know whatever uh spoiler alert for encanto uh at the end the the
[5078.24 --> 5085.52]  family learns their lesson that the magic was was love or whatever and then they get their magical
[5085.52 --> 5092.32]  powers back or like the magic was love and community and that was that was what made them special and
[5092.32 --> 5098.96]  then they just get their just actual magic back so at the they've learned nothing then there was no
[5098.96 --> 5105.28]  loss it was just reset to the beginning of the movie but now mirabella is happy or something yeah
[5105.28 --> 5113.44]  like it just yeah yeah i've got yeah i've got people talking about yeah exactly exactly like just
[5114.08 --> 5123.04]  have a backbone let something bad happen let it be bittersweet let it not be just oh wow uh elijah is
[5123.04 --> 5128.80]  very animated about this i stood up and walked out of the room yelling out of anger had a chance to be one of the
[5128.80 --> 5135.44]  best movies yeah no you're you're a hundred percent right because i've never seen it you can tell you
[5135.44 --> 5140.80]  can tell the movie was supposed to end there that's the big one is when i can tell what was supposed to
[5140.80 --> 5148.80]  happen and then someone with oh we can't do that someone with no primary or secondary sexual
[5148.80 --> 5155.44]  characteristics okay came into the meeting well no you can't say balls you know
[5158.80 --> 5169.28]  you always impress me always always impress me should have waited until he's drinking
[5170.80 --> 5178.64]  okay someone walked in the room and went no this might make people actually feel something
[5178.64 --> 5189.60]  and it's like forget it bail that sucks yeah yeah it sucks yeah in canto and and harry potter i think
[5189.60 --> 5195.28]  are probably my favorite examples of that where they just chickened out there's a bunch but yeah those
[5195.28 --> 5203.04]  are those are strong ones those are recent and hugely culturally significant yes yeah exactly but yeah it's
[5203.04 --> 5215.52]  definitely like a thing that happens uh all right yeah um oh let's uh yeah let's do a topic you were
[5215.52 --> 5220.32]  talking about let's not do a topic yeah you were talking about what was the name of the game again
[5220.32 --> 5229.04]  sea of stars um final fantasy 6 been playing more of it oh yeah yeah oh you don't like it anymore
[5229.04 --> 5235.04]  no i do like it i don't like doing it three times oh hold on hold on i'm trying to i'm trying
[5235.04 --> 5238.96]  to remember what you're talking about hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on okay i didn't say it on
[5238.96 --> 5244.88]  the stream but you do know hold on oh that i don't think i said on stream i thought i thought you meant
[5244.88 --> 5250.56]  something to do with the game no yeah it's been pretty good i do think three times you had another
[5250.56 --> 5254.88]  crash i had one more crash oh and then i stopped playing it tried to figure out what was going on
[5254.88 --> 5260.72]  couldn't figure out what was going on it was only crashing in final fantasy 6 which again is just
[5260.72 --> 5269.12]  weird that's random um but i i uh i just nuked all my drivers even though i'm not reinstalling the
[5269.12 --> 5274.08]  card and it was completely fine for like half a year i just nuked all my drivers as clean as i
[5274.08 --> 5279.20]  possibly could reinstalled everything and i'm gonna try it again this weekend and see how it goes but i lost
[5279.20 --> 5286.48]  like an hour and then i lost like almost the same amount of progress but i think like half an hour
[5286.48 --> 5293.36]  this time or something because i knew it was going on that's really annoying um i do yeah i i do think
[5293.36 --> 5299.60]  this the part of the game that i'm currently in is feels a little bit less engaging than what i just
[5299.60 --> 5305.20]  got through um i was at like the big fight when they're like trying to assault the town that you're
[5305.20 --> 5309.84]  in yeah whatever um i beat that that was cool there's a lot of lead up to that that was all
[5309.84 --> 5315.84]  really exciting and now like i'm not quite as engaged as i was but it's still good i'm at like
[5315.84 --> 5322.24]  what is it to play zozo or something oh oh uh gets real okay pretty soon yeah i started getting
[5322.24 --> 5328.24]  smacked around a little bit yeah yeah the fight was actually really easy no no that that's fine zozo's
[5328.24 --> 5333.44]  a real challenge yeah um they hit hard yeah and all of a sudden you have to like figure out magic
[5333.44 --> 5341.36]  yeah yep i'm running into that but it keeps like dying the game deletes my progress while i'm in
[5341.36 --> 5349.04]  zozo i love the music in zozo the music's pretty cool um i'm trying to figure out i can tell there's
[5349.04 --> 5354.16]  like something going on that i don't understand but then i i don't know if i've gotten to the point
[5354.16 --> 5358.16]  where i can't actually understand it because i haven't finished zozo because it keeps crashing
[5358.16 --> 5363.60]  um but there's like all the people keep talking about the second hand and stuff don't like i'm
[5363.60 --> 5368.96]  not trying to i'm gonna ignore chat for a little while yeah zozo's a weird place yeah yeah there's
[5368.96 --> 5373.68]  some weird stuff going on i have you know picked up on a few things like the town before everybody
[5373.68 --> 5378.16]  tells you they're liars and then you show up and they tell you very specific things yeah so it's like
[5378.16 --> 5382.72]  okay i'll just do the opposite or whatever and then that's been working out yeah but i think there's
[5382.72 --> 5387.04]  other stuff going on um i just haven't had enough time to like really explore it and figure it out
[5387.04 --> 5391.44]  yet fox in a box reminded me of how to train your dragon yeah i kind of just pretend the third movie
[5391.44 --> 5397.60]  doesn't exist yeah uh the first two are incredible how to train your dragon one is one of my all-time
[5397.60 --> 5400.64]  favorite movies i think they just i
[5403.68 --> 5409.84]  i don't see how it was possible for them to deviate that much from the source material and still
[5409.84 --> 5415.84]  just make such an absolute banger of a movie do you like the source material it's great yeah yeah
[5415.84 --> 5419.92]  have you read it no oh okay yeah no it's great the movie and it was great but i haven't read it it's
[5419.92 --> 5427.12]  great in its own way but to give you some idea how different it is toothless okay for okay for one
[5427.12 --> 5432.64]  thing okay to give you some idea how different it is the vikings and the dragons are coexisting
[5432.64 --> 5437.84]  already at the very beginning of how to train your dragon the book series i haven't watched it in a long
[5437.84 --> 5443.36]  time but isn't that like the plot of the first one or something yeah that they don't yeah yeah so
[5444.08 --> 5454.24]  toothless is this big um and like lives in hiccups shirt um that's pretty different yeah
[5456.80 --> 5461.20]  that's cool though yeah did they work with the writer to like make a derivative or did they just
[5461.20 --> 5467.52]  come up with it on their own i don't know if crested a cow cow cow cow so i can't remember her name uh but
[5467.52 --> 5475.52]  uh i i don't know how involved she was in the movies but they are completely different um but
[5475.52 --> 5480.80]  they did they did the typical movie thing so the the books end well um and but they did the typical
[5480.80 --> 5486.40]  movie thing where in the third one it's just like yeah there's a sad ending and then they're just like
[5487.84 --> 5488.16]  fail
[5492.88 --> 5496.00]  yeah i hate that i don't know i saw some people talking about how their kids movies you know they're
[5496.00 --> 5502.08]  you're not the target audience it's like right but the kids media that i remember so much had
[5502.08 --> 5510.00]  sadness it had emotion like one of one of maybe no i i think it's fair to say one of my favorite
[5510.00 --> 5517.76]  movies when i was a kid was the land before time that is a devastating it has it it's emotionally yeah
[5517.76 --> 5521.28]  people are already pointing it out one of the most like quintessential obvious examples is bambi
[5521.28 --> 5534.24]  yeah doesn't come back alive nope no mama's dead yeah yeah man lion king yeah mufasa is like he's
[5534.24 --> 5542.24]  dead you can't undo that you know yeah like this whole just like i don't know uh uh time travel
[5542.24 --> 5549.44]  uh uh resurrection i'll just undo the negative effects like yeah nah man
[5549.44 --> 5555.76]  uh anyway uh we're supposed to do sponsor spots apparently sorry dan
[5557.36 --> 5564.00]  what do we got i fix it the show is sponsored by i fix it linus talk about our past relationship
[5564.00 --> 5570.08]  with them yeah man i fix it has been a huge supporter and for a long time i would have said
[5570.08 --> 5576.00]  of the show but what i mean to say is they've been a supporter in a bigger way than just the show i fix it
[5576.00 --> 5584.00]  is one of the sponsors that i think we are probably most aligned with in terms of our beliefs and our
[5584.00 --> 5589.68]  goals as a company um and like every time i've seen them do pretty much anything i'm like yeah it's it's
[5589.68 --> 5595.12]  the right thing to do whether whether it's their products whether it's their partnerships yeah the fact
[5595.12 --> 5603.60]  that man the when when valve announced that oh so sick you'd have access to so sick to to third well
[5603.60 --> 5610.00]  excuse me first party parts to service your steam deck when i found out that it was i going to be
[5610.00 --> 5614.80]  through i fix it i was like man confidence level through the roof exactly yeah because they have
[5614.80 --> 5622.48]  one of those brands that's just when they're involved you know that someone who cares is working
[5622.48 --> 5628.56]  on it um so so the things that they do that we love they promote the repairability of electronics they
[5628.56 --> 5633.84]  promote the reduction of e-waste uh we're looking forward to many more years of partnership um and
[5633.84 --> 5637.52]  right now oh this is cool hey speaking of what we're talking about earlier on the show with the
[5637.52 --> 5643.68]  whole um this time of year there's like deals and stuff you can get 25 off of i fix it bundles like
[5643.68 --> 5648.08]  the gamer bundle or the popular pro tech bundle i was just gonna say just by checking them out at
[5648.08 --> 5652.96]  the link below and you can save an additional 10 when you buy any spare part that's another big one for
[5652.96 --> 5658.80]  me with i fix it is unlike just buying something random on ebay or amazon which you can do when i
[5658.80 --> 5665.12]  buy something from i fix it if it's an adhesive strip or a pack of you know screws or whatever
[5665.12 --> 5672.40]  else it is it's it's the it's the brand name replacement part but the prices are reasonable yeah
[5673.12 --> 5677.04]  so check them out i fix it i didn't have much in the way of talking points but i guess it doesn't
[5677.04 --> 5682.72]  matter because we just really love the products we use them a lot um and we love the mission that that's
[5682.72 --> 5688.08]  the big thing i mean nobody's perfect i'm sure someone somewhere has some criticism of something
[5688.08 --> 5692.56]  about i fix it something but at the end of the day i think their hearts are in the right place great
[5692.56 --> 5698.24]  stuff and we support that i've never seen this before and it's not even on sale but their repair

[5839.28 --> 5843.92]  whole set in those what are we supposed to be doing next three merge messages what really oh no let's do a
[5843.92 --> 5850.80]  topic let's do a topic okay sold yeah we took so long yes you did epic finally wins a jury has sided
[5850.80 --> 5856.72]  with epic in their lawsuit against google agreeing that google used anti-competitive business practices
[5856.72 --> 5861.92]  to maintain the play store's dominant position in the android app distribution market so how is that
[5861.92 --> 5868.40]  possible but they lost to apple okay so as far as i can tell it came down to oh here look it's in our
[5868.40 --> 5874.16]  notes epic lost a similar battle against apple which is currently appealing to the supreme court
[5874.16 --> 5879.84]  a major distinction between the two fights seems to be that while apple just disallowed competitors
[5879.84 --> 5887.36]  from its platform outright google suppressed competition through behind the scenes deals while
[5887.36 --> 5894.32]  technically allowing third-party app stores google executives also made the error of writing things down
[5894.32 --> 5901.76]  and attempting but failing to delete the evidence so it turns out you just have to be even more of a
[5901.76 --> 5908.40]  monopolist and then it's not a problem yeah i would prefer the just not allowing i i would i would
[5908.40 --> 5915.36]  actually say if i had to pick one and apparently the jury agrees apples well i think they're both wrong
[5915.36 --> 5921.68]  google is likely to appeal the ruling however this marks the first major antitrust decision in the u.s since
[5921.68 --> 5925.28]  the one against microsoft over 23 years ago and there should have definitely been a lot more can i
[5925.28 --> 5932.40]  just say i'm rooting for a lot more yeah like for real man apple meanwhile is likely to get hit with
[5932.40 --> 5938.96]  an eu ban on the app store's current anti-steering rules that ban music services from pushing users
[5938.96 --> 5945.20]  towards alternate subscription options the european council is also investigating apple's restrictions on
[5945.20 --> 5950.56]  its tap and go combined payment feature in response apple has offered to open the feature up to
[5950.56 --> 5959.20]  apple pay competitors i think that between the us finally recognizing google's nonsense and the eu
[5959.20 --> 5965.68]  continuing to use just awesome to just they just win completely understand what apple's doing everything
[5965.68 --> 5973.28]  apple is doing is pretty much to maintain its stranglehold on the walled garden ecosystem i don't know
[5973.28 --> 5978.00]  what group of people in the eu because i i don't pay attention there's enough stuff going on in canada
[5978.00 --> 5985.44]  um i don't know what group of people is like championing these things within that governing body but
[5986.00 --> 5995.20]  damn doing good work absolute giga chad yeah um and i can't say i'm the biggest fan of epic and yeah
[5995.20 --> 6001.28]  you know i'm not saying everything tim sweeney's ever done is um nope good at all
[6001.28 --> 6011.52]  um some of it's great yeah this is great even uh even my my one personal toe-to-toe with him i ended up
[6011.52 --> 6019.84]  being more right than um i was led to believe i was i was i was treated like i was completely wrong and i
[6019.84 --> 6025.52]  was wrong about a lot of things the ps5's you know ssd architecture was very cool and i you know was
[6025.52 --> 6029.68]  probably dismissive of it in a way that i shouldn't have been and i would have understood better if you know
[6029.68 --> 6034.08]  blah blah blah i had watched mark cerny's presentation and i corrected all that and i was
[6034.08 --> 6040.72]  i was wrong about a lot of things but what i wasn't wrong about was that sweeney was clearly sucking
[6041.36 --> 6047.92]  sony's dick over it uh in a way that seemed disproportionate and then what was it two weeks
[6047.92 --> 6053.20]  later i think so a week later it came out that sony had made a huge investment into epic games it was
[6053.20 --> 6061.28]  really fast so even though i got some of the details wrong my detector was 100 calibrated
[6061.28 --> 6070.40]  or the argument yeah uh yeah yeah uh but but with that said the way that they've gone about this like
[6070.40 --> 6074.88]  we shouldn't just like crap on the good things that they're doing because we haven't agreed with
[6074.88 --> 6080.80]  someone over everything we've ever done in the past and they have clearly not accepted a ruling that just
[6080.80 --> 6087.76]  helps epic games they have clearly drawn a line that says no we want a solution for the entire
[6087.76 --> 6096.24]  ecosystem that just breaks down the walls around these gardens whether they are explicit walls or
[6096.24 --> 6103.20]  hidden walls and just cut the bull like the the funny thing is that's how it always used to work
[6103.92 --> 6110.64]  you could buy it an application is what we used to call it from anywhere and there was
[6110.64 --> 6115.68]  competition in the marketplace and you could install it on your freaking computer and then we just all
[6115.68 --> 6119.60]  kind of lost track of that because oh no i don't know it's a phone it's not a computer it's a computer
[6121.04 --> 6128.00]  none of this matters get it any get the application anywhere and there are ways to ensure that these
[6128.00 --> 6129.36]  applications are just as
[6132.08 --> 6136.24]  it's important safe as if they were purchased through the play store through an app store
[6136.24 --> 6144.08]  i don't know well you've got the tabby bit and i feel like if it came undone but the tabby bit was
[6144.08 --> 6147.84]  done it would just flap like this but having on the bottom they're just gonna hinge but if i wanted
[6147.84 --> 6152.48]  my uh what what's the point of these right right right but then if i wanted my cleavage
[6152.48 --> 6157.68]  to show i wouldn't want the tabs there oh i don't know maybe they're supposed to go on the side i'm i'm just not sure
[6157.68 --> 6165.04]  no he no no the tab dan we're talking about what the tab is for yeah
[6167.36 --> 6177.20]  the top to the top then but then what if what if you have a low cut yeah it's not for that oh oh sorry
[6177.20 --> 6188.32]  there you go now you look better is this a serious podcast i had this a podcast i had a moment like
[6188.32 --> 6198.40]  23 minutes ago hold on i'm sorry i'm gonna let you finish but what this comes up a lot what the
[6198.40 --> 6204.72]  is the difference between this and a podcast people keep telling me the wang show is not a podcast and
[6204.72 --> 6209.84]  honestly admittedly i don't watch podcasts i don't listen excuse me i don't listen to them
[6210.64 --> 6215.20]  what is the difference how many podcasts there's literally no difference there's technically a
[6215.20 --> 6220.08]  podcast we post the audio to all of the podcasting sites i was just gonna say literally in charge of
[6220.08 --> 6226.32]  dealing with all the back backline systems for the podcast version of this and some of them we even just
[6226.32 --> 6233.92]  upload the whole video you can watch the wan show with video on spotify which i didn't even know was a
[6233.92 --> 6240.88]  thing really you didn't know that i didn't know that spotify sent me a christmas present oh that's
[6240.88 --> 6245.68]  nice yeah apparently we're like a creator on that platform now i was like who the are you when like
[6245.68 --> 6254.40]  the rep reached out oh my god he didn't say it that way oh we just left no i mean that's way more
[6254.40 --> 6260.80]  words than i type in emails yeah we went through this last week yeah yeah no no we just uh we just
[6260.80 --> 6266.00]  technically left spotify yeah that's like that's like five whole words we left spotify we're on
[6266.00 --> 6272.08]  different more better spotify now what's what's that it's still what is it i don't know if we're
[6272.08 --> 6276.56]  going to talk about it or not but maybe i thought you had been mentioned we're still on spotify we're
[6276.56 --> 6282.32]  still on spotify we are yeah but it's more better what we changed the way that we're on spotify well
[6282.32 --> 6287.68]  what's that none of this oh okay so we're not having a business meeting on wan show do you want
[6287.68 --> 6291.60]  to have a business meeting on wancho theoretically it should get on there faster is this confidential
[6291.60 --> 6297.68]  because people i have no idea i don't think so okay we get a lot of we get a lot of negative feedback
[6297.68 --> 6303.60]  when the wan show goes up like the next week on spotify yeah no one wants to work on it over the
[6303.60 --> 6309.84]  weekend um yeah it's amazing how that works people are super mad when there's a perception that we have
[6309.84 --> 6315.84]  crunch or overwork our employees but they're even more mad yes when the wan show doesn't miraculously
[6315.84 --> 6321.52]  get posted instantly on the weekend when it's like still processing or it's a funny thing right it's
[6321.52 --> 6327.84]  like what i don't know what do you guys want well the new system should allow us i should allow me uh
[6327.84 --> 6332.00]  to post it immediately after the wan show yeah tacky the penguin says just pay someone to work on the
[6332.00 --> 6336.00]  weekend what if they don't want to work on the weekend you're already paying me i'm already here did
[6336.00 --> 6340.64]  you ever think of that yeah so it should be it should be faster now and there's other cool
[6340.64 --> 6347.76]  benefits there is um i and i think it goes on more more platforms now i don't think so it's just a
[6347.76 --> 6353.04]  centralized platform so that we don't have to have 700 000 accounts yeah and it is a spotify uh partner
[6353.04 --> 6360.40]  thing it's called megaphone yeah so it gets distributed out from them okay by them okay still spotify we just
[6360.40 --> 6368.16]  one one source it do the thing now dan doesn't have to go boop as many times i don't even touch it
[6368.16 --> 6374.56]  that's other people yeah it's like five other people for multiple hours to produce the podcast version of
[6374.56 --> 6381.36]  the live broadcast version of the whatever the show this is yeah i don't the talk show it's a talk show
[6381.36 --> 6390.96]  that's a live stream and it's also a podcast and it's snowing on the banner yeah i love it who knows
[6391.76 --> 6397.36]  was that a good business meeting goodbye yeah it was pretty good business meeting um realistically
[6397.36 --> 6405.04]  guys yes we we could have someone work a 20 minute shift on oh wait no we can't do that because that's
[6405.04 --> 6412.32]  illegal yeah okay so hold on no we could have someone do a tuesday to saturday um except what
[6412.32 --> 6417.76]  would they what would they do for the rest of their day nobody else is in office and i guarantee
[6417.76 --> 6422.40]  you they don't want to do that uh yeah almost almost nobody wants to give up and what if they have a
[6422.40 --> 6430.08]  problem well then they're gonna call me yeah yeah great perfect guess what i don't want to work on
[6430.08 --> 6435.36]  saturday yeah and you know what there are things that we do do on weekends but they are
[6436.64 --> 6440.32]  it's not supposed to be a scheduled thing to happen every single yeah like this this sunday we're coming
[6440.32 --> 6444.08]  in to shoot a video but the only reason we're doing that is because the video is about upgrading our
[6444.08 --> 6448.48]  infrastructure which is something we can't do yeah i was just gonna say every once in a while dan or
[6448.48 --> 6452.80]  sean or just sean or just dan or whatever will have to come in to do some form of infrastructure thing
[6452.80 --> 6456.96]  because you you don't want downtime while people are here like it happens but it's not something you want to
[6456.96 --> 6462.88]  to schedule like but i think it should be recurring schedule it being recurringly scheduled like that
[6462.88 --> 6469.68]  would i think be a issue legally right this is like this is hilarious maybe people are flipping out in
[6469.68 --> 6475.20]  float plane chat you can't schedule someone to work for a single hour in canada no no you see guys
[6475.20 --> 6479.76]  minimum guys i think this is where a lot of the miscommunication around the union thing comes from
[6480.32 --> 6486.80]  we have really strong worker protections here like just at all no i no you can't do that
[6486.80 --> 6491.44]  because it's not considered reasonable for someone to commute to and from a place of work
[6491.44 --> 6497.52]  and then only be scheduled for a very short shift i believe the minimum is four hours um and so you
[6497.52 --> 6506.32]  know above and beyond that we do a lot and all i've ever said i've never said you know they can't because
[6506.32 --> 6513.12]  i can't say that because that's illegal um all i've ever said is that i would consider it a failure i would
[6513.12 --> 6520.08]  think that we screwed up if people felt that that was necessary it looks like it's i thought it i
[6520.08 --> 6526.24]  swear it was four but it looks like it's two oh okay it might also depend but like that would also be a
[6527.20 --> 6532.96]  super lame thing to do well yeah so like you don't want to do that even if we could do that we wouldn't
[6532.96 --> 6544.72]  it's stupid yeah yeah yeah guys it's just it's man it's anyway yeah i just looked up the hours of
[6544.72 --> 6550.24]  work and overtime for british columbia and it says two i i totally had the understanding that it was
[6550.24 --> 6555.68]  four i think the four might be like if you're scheduled for a shift and then you get there and
[6555.68 --> 6561.12]  you're there for 20 minutes and they go oh actually we don't need you today we have to you have to pay up
[6561.12 --> 6566.00]  four is that if they try to send you home yeah yeah that might be it four hours minimum even if
[6566.00 --> 6577.20]  they have nothing for you to do yep um yeah so i don't know guys yeah it's we could but there's
[6577.20 --> 6583.92]  another factor it's a relatively low priority yeah and now it doesn't even matter yeah you could get it
[6583.92 --> 6590.32]  on youtube you could get it on float plane yeah we had people asking why the float plane one is delayed and
[6590.32 --> 6596.40]  that's just because of processing time we don't have youtube magic we don't do live processing stuff
[6596.40 --> 6602.48]  it's kind of cool the the youtube stuff yeah oh yeah absolutely it's super cool we don't have that
[6602.48 --> 6609.44]  super cool yeah yeah maybe someday maybe not all right uh what else are we supposed to be talking
[6609.44 --> 6617.28]  about right now oh i love this tesla demands statute of limitations on lying yeah this is amazing
[6617.28 --> 6623.28]  that moment like this is some supreme level gaslighting stuff right here uh i didn't lie but
[6623.28 --> 6628.96]  if i did it doesn't matter yeah because it was a long time ago uh following a two-year investigation
[6628.96 --> 6633.92]  the california department of motor vehicles is accusing tesla of misleading advertising concerning
[6633.92 --> 6638.80]  its full self-driving feature something that i'd like to point out that we were calling them on
[6638.80 --> 6645.44]  many years before the department of motor vehicles brought it up and tesla thinks that delay for them to
[6645.44 --> 6652.24]  bring it up is a really big deal tesla argues that it relied on the assumption that the dmv tacitly
[6652.24 --> 6658.64]  accepted its marketing because tesla started using the term full self-driving in 2016 and the dmv didn't
[6658.64 --> 6668.32]  act until 2021. wow tesla also claims that california's false advertising rules for autonomous vehicles
[6668.32 --> 6674.64]  inappropriately restrict constitutionally protected speech that is truthful and non-misleading
[6680.96 --> 6687.52]  so because no one called you on your bull for a long time you should get off now there are things
[6687.52 --> 6695.36]  that work that way like we had talked before about how um i believe this came up when we were talking about
[6695.36 --> 6702.16]  uh react streamers where uh yeah there are actually rules in place where if you know that someone is
[6702.16 --> 6706.88]  infringing your copyright you have to defend and you intentionally allow them to continue to do it for
[6706.88 --> 6714.56]  a long time so that you can seek additional damages um that can that can blow up in your face and you you can
[6714.56 --> 6721.20]  lose that because you didn't do anything about it but this is different there is no increase in damages
[6721.20 --> 6730.40]  that the dmv is after they're just saying you can't do that um
[6732.48 --> 6737.68]  i don't know maybe the down well i actually don't know what damages thereafter i have no idea
[6740.64 --> 6743.12]  okay forget that
[6743.12 --> 6748.96]  uh
[6748.96 --> 6753.44]  huh yeah what would the what would the difference be here that's very interesting
[6756.08 --> 6761.84]  ah could they make the argument that they you know didn't know or realize the extent of it they
[6761.84 --> 6765.68]  needed to conduct their investigation i think this is going to be this is going to be an interesting one
[6765.68 --> 6769.84]  there is weird stuff because like do you remember remember that i'm gonna i'm gonna offshoot here a
[6769.84 --> 6772.96]  little bit for a sec but do you remember that whole thing where the subway sandwiches were not
[6772.96 --> 6778.08]  actually a foot long and they said that foot long was just like the name not a descriptor
[6778.96 --> 6783.68]  and all that kind of stuff they ended up losing that and they're they're an actual foot long now um
[6785.84 --> 6790.32]  so like there there was a bunch of that going on at that time i if i remember correctly there was
[6790.32 --> 6794.56]  like fresh never frozen from some other place i don't know if that's the exact timeline but it's
[6794.56 --> 6798.16]  something along those lines and they said tim hortons maybe it was i don't know i don't remember it
[6798.16 --> 6802.88]  it was it was one of them that was something like that um i don't remember if it was exactly that
[6802.88 --> 6811.04]  don't look too far into it um but they were like yeah 100 real canadian beef something like that is
[6811.04 --> 6818.24]  also a company not a tagline yeah like that's that's crazy it's like that's the name of our
[6818.24 --> 6823.36]  company that doesn't actually mean anything it's like okay come on like this type of stuff is not
[6823.36 --> 6827.28]  maybe that's the one i was thinking of i don't know um but this type of stuff is not really
[6827.84 --> 6830.32]  super new but it is definitely super bs
[6834.96 --> 6839.92]  okay well at any rate uh good luck with that everyone uh we're supposed to do three merch
[6839.92 --> 6845.44]  messages now dan you want to hit me oh i heard his chair move i thought he thought he was coming over
[6845.44 --> 6850.96]  here i didn't think i did anything that bad today i'm so ready to go i've been preparing for this
[6852.96 --> 6862.48]  okay let's see um hey lld we know linus has cameras in his house linus that's creepy uh linus
[6862.48 --> 6867.28]  what went into your decision to include them uh did you have discussions with the family about privacy
[6867.28 --> 6874.96]  keep up the great work um yeah i mean the decisions to include them i think when we first installed them
[6874.96 --> 6882.80]  was when we first got a nanny like a like an outside of our family nanny um and we were very
[6882.80 --> 6887.20]  upfront with them that we had them when we hired them we got them in advance of hiring the nanny so
[6887.20 --> 6894.24]  that it wouldn't be a weird change a surprise yeah uh but we we just wanted the peace of mind of knowing
[6894.24 --> 6902.32]  what the heck was going on in our house um and it's been so useful for everything from figuring out
[6902.32 --> 6911.04]  which cat is peeing on things to uh where i left my keys to what actually happened when two kids come
[6911.04 --> 6918.16]  to me with different stories that i just don't see how i would ever go back at this point i thought it
[6918.16 --> 6925.76]  was going to be super weird when you first set it up and then i was like whatever i don't know like
[6925.76 --> 6935.52]  realistically you've probably hmm how do i say this you've probably said things in my house
[6936.24 --> 6943.60]  that if they leaked on the internet you wouldn't be happy about it probably and yeah that could mean
[6943.60 --> 6953.60]  anything yeah um but at the end of the day i mean i think we have enough mutual trust that that doesn't
[6953.60 --> 6959.52]  matter um and i think that's probably a pretty big part of it like i don't know i don't know
[6960.48 --> 6964.56]  how i'd feel like if i just went over to someone's house and they like didn't tell me about it and i
[6964.56 --> 6969.20]  like noticed part way through oh interesting yeah and or if it's someone that you don't know and you're
[6969.20 --> 6976.88]  exactly yeah okay um yours i think something that helps is they have that blue thing yeah they're like
[6976.88 --> 6981.76]  very like they're not hiding yeah whenever there's motion they yeah they're like very much like hey
[6981.76 --> 6986.48]  a reminder that i'm here like they're not it doesn't feel like you're trying to sneak the cameras
[6987.04 --> 6993.44]  um but if i figured out like way into a night of hanging out that like this person had a recording
[6993.44 --> 6997.84]  of the entire thing and i didn't really know this person all that well and stuff that might be weird
[6997.84 --> 7005.20]  yeah it's technically legal here yeah we're a we're a single party consent um territory yeah but it's still
[7005.20 --> 7013.84]  considered uh i don't know if i would say taboo but it's it's still definitely considered odd um to
[7013.84 --> 7019.04]  just you know be recording pull out your phone and record a conversation like it's it's clear you expect
[7019.04 --> 7028.24]  something to go down um i don't know man i it's it's it's mostly just a convenience thing for me
[7028.24 --> 7034.88]  the the reality of it is that cameras don't do anything to protect you from theft the only the
[7034.88 --> 7041.44]  only outcome the only somewhat positive outcome we've had from um a break-in that we had at the
[7041.44 --> 7048.16]  office a number of years ago was that they ultimately did catch the guy but we didn't get anything back
[7048.72 --> 7054.00]  yeah uh we we still had to pay out our insurance because everything they confiscated was evidence
[7054.00 --> 7059.92]  it's like okay cool so they're like yeah you should probably just like go through your insurance
[7059.92 --> 7063.76]  because it could be years before you get this stuff back because the court's moved slow it's like okay
[7063.76 --> 7072.96]  thanks for that that's really great uh super cool uh anyway uh i i don't remember where we're going
[7072.96 --> 7077.84]  with this dan you want to hit me again yeah sure we'll do that uh that top one there sure what is the
[7077.84 --> 7083.92]  most legitimate hard-hitting or cutting bit of criticism you have received from your viewers
[7083.92 --> 7094.72]  oh man the most legitimate it's hard to say because when we get feedback that i think is
[7094.72 --> 7106.40]  really legitimate we try to act on it um and hard-hitting i think the most hard-hitting thing could
[7107.28 --> 7112.88]  is gonna be something that seems relatively simple on the surface like this is boring um
[7113.60 --> 7120.72]  i don't know about that i definitely i definitely took it to heart in a big way when people were
[7122.08 --> 7129.20]  rightly critical of us for um doing that that sponsored video with facebook on the portal
[7130.72 --> 7136.96]  it was a product that for the purpose that it served it served its purpose it was a video calling
[7136.96 --> 7143.76]  machine for video calling people on facebook but from a price to performance standpoint you know
[7144.72 --> 7150.56]  aside from it doing what they said it was going to do it's not like i it's not like anyone here felt
[7150.56 --> 7157.28]  it was the best possible solution for that and we did all of our usual things where we we went out of
[7157.28 --> 7164.88]  our way to not say anything that we don't believe um we included talking points clearly presented as
[7164.88 --> 7173.04]  talking points um but people were were upset with us working with facebook at all and so
[7173.04 --> 7183.28]  that's something that we have that's something that changed the way that we looked at sponsor
[7183.28 --> 7192.40]  engagements back then and has persisted up until now um i don't know if we've had many opportunities
[7192.40 --> 7198.96]  if any to work with facebook on you know product hardware or sponsorships or anything like that but
[7199.84 --> 7205.20]  i'm not aware of us having done so that doesn't mean that we don't work with facebook at all i mean
[7205.20 --> 7210.72]  we post our videos on their platform so they they write us checks um i know we did a thing where they
[7210.72 --> 7216.08]  had like this um it was like a podcast thing or like like spaces or something i forget what it was
[7216.08 --> 7221.12]  even called but we had like some guests and we did we did like a sponsored series there uh but people
[7221.12 --> 7227.92]  made it very clear that especially with what was going on with uh meta then oculus um and facebook and
[7227.92 --> 7231.60]  the way that they were handling all of that that they were really unhappy with facebook's sort of
[7231.60 --> 7238.72]  hardware division and didn't want us working with them so you know that's something um i've got to say
[7239.76 --> 7247.28]  uh a lot of our i feel like a lot of our transparency in sponsorships has kind of bitten us in the butt i
[7247.28 --> 7252.16]  think that people see us talk about sponsorships a lot and talk about our relationships with companies
[7252.16 --> 7257.44]  a lot and then assume that you know everything they see is just the tip of the iceberg and for every
[7257.44 --> 7262.08]  one thing that we disclose there's probably 10 that we don't uh one thing that was really frustrating
[7262.08 --> 7266.00]  recently was the amount of negative feedback we took over our playstation portal review
[7266.56 --> 7273.52]  i was really upfront that i'm bullish on these devices i think they're super cool um i think that
[7273.52 --> 7279.44]  for the audience the playstation portal is a solution that could make sense i think the pricing makes
[7279.44 --> 7286.16]  sense on a hardware level realistically you are not at the required margins of a you know publicly
[7286.16 --> 7291.76]  traded company like sony and its various retail partners you're not building a device for less
[7291.76 --> 7297.84]  than 200 that does that stuff we expressed our our doubts about the future of the device if sony
[7297.84 --> 7303.12]  keeps it locked down and optimism about the community jailbreaking it and we said everything that we had
[7303.12 --> 7308.80]  to say about it and the number of people that have looked at that video and gone obvious shill paid by
[7308.80 --> 7317.12]  sony has been really discouraging because we haven't talked about this but we explicitly turned down a
[7317.12 --> 7323.92]  sponsorship for the playstation portal we've actually never to my knowledge worked with sony in a
[7323.92 --> 7330.88]  sponsored capacity and it's possible that a deal or two has happened that i'm not aware of sure but i'm not
[7330.88 --> 7337.28]  aware of any and we specifically didn't take any money on the playstation portal because we were
[7337.28 --> 7343.68]  concerned about the optics of us liking it talking about it positively when we knew that there was
[7343.68 --> 7348.80]  a subset of people that were really angry about it and we kind of went yeah this is not the right
[7348.80 --> 7352.88]  thing for our audience and we need to make sure that we keep this one purely editorial and then to have
[7352.88 --> 7361.44]  that like thrown in our faces was um i just don't really know what to make of it i i i i don't understand
[7361.44 --> 7365.76]  the whole situation it's like can you imagine for a second a product that wasn't made for you
[7365.76 --> 7372.88]  yeah yeah i i've brought this up before but related to uh reviews of different technology but like
[7372.88 --> 7377.84]  having every single person in your entire sphere say the exact same is not actually yeah say the
[7377.84 --> 7383.60]  exact same thing is not actually a good experience you you want people to show different opinions
[7383.60 --> 7389.12]  and just because you're like a xbox fanboy or a pc fanboy uh and it's not for you doesn't mean it
[7389.12 --> 7394.24]  didn't sell out like immediately and every person that i know that owns a playstation bought one
[7394.24 --> 7401.12]  and is also happy with it well just the super flawed logic right like i saw people talking about
[7401.12 --> 7406.40]  how this isn't a 200 device it's a 700 device because you also need a playstation 5 what the
[7406.40 --> 7411.04]  are you talking about you already have a playstation 5 or you wouldn't be buying this you need to buy
[7411.04 --> 7418.24]  another one now no i i don't know it's not a product for me that's like saying a tank of gas costs
[7418.24 --> 7421.68]  25 000 because you have to have a car to put it in it's like
[7426.32 --> 7431.60]  like little tree air freshener that's a really good analogy actually
[7433.28 --> 7439.60]  i just don't know how to deal with it right and it's it's really funny because so much of the of the
[7439.60 --> 7445.60]  conspiracy theory this must have been sponsored stuff that gets posted about us it's from people who
[7445.60 --> 7451.36]  so obviously don't understand how brands work and how sponsorships work that i just don't really know
[7451.36 --> 7457.36]  how to even begin to correct it right like we talk openly in that video about jailbreaking the portal
[7458.48 --> 7468.56]  do you imagine for a second that any executive at sony would green like that are you stupid honestly
[7468.56 --> 7487.04]  yeah wow you know wow that's not how that works that's not how any of that works brands are so
[7487.04 --> 7493.44]  cautious about their image and about controlling their messaging guys that think about it they will
[7493.44 --> 7499.68]  pull their advertising off of a platform just because there might be a risk that they're completely
[7499.68 --> 7506.72]  separate ad might show near something that they find incompatible with their brand
[7508.80 --> 7518.88]  yeah come on you know come on common sense it's it's hard it's really hard um it's not that hard please
[7518.88 --> 7529.76]  i can't um yeah so so you know i think the hardest hitting sorry back to the original question i
[7529.76 --> 7538.08]  know got completely derailed here hardest hitting um but legitimate
[7541.12 --> 7546.16]  yeah luke's probably right when the content sucks it's and we know it's time to innovate and it's hard
[7546.16 --> 7552.16]  yeah especially when you try it on something and then a not insignificant amount of people are like
[7553.20 --> 7560.16]  it's like oh man oh they've been going down lately it's like damn dude like i actually put effort into
[7560.16 --> 7564.64]  this one if you did just like fart it out then sure whatever maybe the problem is that a lot of the
[7564.64 --> 7569.60]  time the fart out stuff is what performs really well and the stuff we work really hard on like the
[7569.60 --> 7573.36]  playstation best performing video of all time was a fart out dude the playstation portal we worked
[7573.36 --> 7581.84]  really hard on yeah we we crunched um we didn't get it till late um we because there was the
[7581.84 --> 7588.80]  sponsorship opportunity we uh we had to have meetings internally to kind of talk about whether this
[7588.80 --> 7595.44]  makes sense and and if we should proceed um we we wanted to test it in a way that was meaningful
[7595.44 --> 7602.24]  given that reviews of the device were already out before we even got access to ours so we wanted to
[7602.24 --> 7607.52]  we wanted to you know up our game and make sure we were doing a very comprehensive look at it including
[7607.52 --> 7613.68]  uh pickups after we had shot it to address new information that had come to light like information
[7613.68 --> 7620.48]  about the soc but so much of the criticism about that video was just utterly unfair like i i was taken
[7620.48 --> 7626.96]  to task at uh by a number of people over talking about how it has storage it doesn't have any storage of
[7626.96 --> 7631.44]  course it has storage what else does the operating system run on
[7634.00 --> 7641.44]  i included storage in the cloud i included storage in my bill of materials because of course it has storage
[7643.44 --> 7648.16]  what you think the bits are magic i'm sorry i keep talking about this but like
[7648.16 --> 7656.56]  what are you talking about you might not have money yeah you might not even have access to it yeah
[7656.56 --> 7662.80]  but it's still there it's still there they still have to pay for it yeah it's not magic yeah geez man yeah
[7664.40 --> 7670.48]  uh anyway come on man the os isn't storage no but it sits on it
[7670.48 --> 7680.40]  oh man oh man oh man it's bill of materials they had to buy a thing that you can put data on
[7681.04 --> 7685.60]  to put inside the playstation portable it doesn't mean you can use it it's just all wire memory
[7687.04 --> 7689.76]  yeah wire memory thank you dan um
[7689.76 --> 7701.20]  it's just all over do you want another merch message no all right uh hi dll given some of the
[7701.20 --> 7707.68]  messes amd has managed to make even as the nice guy of the graphics industry what would happen if
[7707.68 --> 7713.36]  nvidia really does leave the graphics and radeon becomes the big dog in town they would do exactly
[7713.36 --> 7717.68]  what they did in cpus and they would stomp all over you and maximize their profits for their
[7717.68 --> 7723.84]  shareholders i mean they're a corporation right that's what they do and before you say it yes
[7723.84 --> 7730.56]  linus media group incorporated is also a corporation but there's a very big difference between a company
[7730.56 --> 7737.52]  with many many shareholders and a complex corporate structure and one that has two shareholders who sleep
[7737.52 --> 7745.28]  together yvonne and i are pretty aligned on things and if we decide that our corporation can just
[7745.28 --> 7751.44]  you know make less money because we feel like it's the right thing to do then we can do that but
[7751.44 --> 7758.08]  that's not something that a company with a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders can do so it's
[7758.08 --> 7767.36]  not quite the same thing but also corporations are not your friends any of them trust but verify is there
[7767.36 --> 7773.04]  any other sort of things that we should remind people of don't pre-order yeah yeah no i think that
[7773.04 --> 7778.16]  one's pretty good don't buy a playstation portal if you don't have a playstation yeah
[7780.00 --> 7785.52]  maybe yeah maybe you're right it's not for you maybe it is a bad product for you maybe it's a bad
[7785.52 --> 7790.32]  product i don't even know yeah i i have no interest in it because i don't have a playstation yeah
[7790.32 --> 7796.08]  so why do i care but my job is to put myself in the head of someone who might be interested in that product
[7796.08 --> 7804.00]  and people with playstations really liked the review yeah oh man i don't know sorry okay i was
[7804.00 --> 7808.96]  unsure about it uh because people were mad at you about it and i was like does this matter and i checked
[7808.96 --> 7815.92]  in with friends that have playstations and they're like all right i got one seems pretty all right like
[7815.92 --> 7825.76]  uh okay i don't know yeah yeah all right uh what are we supposed to be doing right now i don't know
[7825.76 --> 7832.08]  we're way off track uh you can either topic yeah go back to topics segment what is adver games i have
[7832.08 --> 7837.76]  uh the adver game segment if you would like to participate okay yeah can we play adver games you
[7837.76 --> 7844.48]  get to play adver games nice we'll probably do with the top one and the bottom one first or you
[7844.48 --> 7849.36]  can start with the middle one one of them requires a laptop the other one requires an xbox
[7849.92 --> 7854.08]  um why don't you just tell us what to do because i think my brain is basically fried today was a
[7854.08 --> 7859.04]  really long day let's just go in order we did the order makes it more complicated we did a tech upgrade
[7860.48 --> 7867.60]  for electro boom oh cool it's that's probably sick he hugged me oh that's cool the upgrade
[7867.60 --> 7872.48]  was that good did he do it while electrified no actually oh wow i mean he did that too
[7873.52 --> 7880.24]  no no it was he said this was this was this is crazy because i think it's so easy to get stuck in
[7880.24 --> 7892.56]  our bubble of just you know we three fps here and you know uh everyone everyone i don't i don't know
[7892.56 --> 7898.56]  what bubble it is but just the bubble where we live and breathe technology and it's mind-boggling to
[7898.56 --> 7905.04]  us that other people don't you know um he said to me i thought lag was just part of life
[7907.20 --> 7917.84]  because uh he was scrubbing the timeline on his new pc and it was instant it was just fluid and he was
[7917.84 --> 7925.04]  like this is going to help me so much um he's a he's a he's a he's a he's an interesting character
[7925.04 --> 7932.08]  i love meddy he's just one of the most genuine people yeah um so down to earth you know he's got
[7932.08 --> 7937.20]  six million subscribers like the guy's the guy's huge right like you know he's the kind of guy where
[7937.20 --> 7943.12]  you know great artists his kids friends come over and want selfies with their dad right like you know
[7943.12 --> 7953.28]  like he's huge and he's just a normal dude super nice dude super cool dude uh but sometimes he does
[7953.28 --> 7958.64]  drive me crazy a little bit because he doesn't make investments that to me as a technophile are
[7958.64 --> 7967.04]  kind of obvious and he just you know tolerates things not working and i'm just like constantly
[7967.04 --> 7971.44]  weird and confusing to me i'll hear about some creator that's like massive and it's like what's
[7971.44 --> 7978.40]  their like data storage solution it's like eight usb hard drives and it's like what yeah what yeah
[7978.40 --> 7984.96]  because imagine this some people have a life outside of tinkering with their computer no i know it's
[7984.96 --> 7992.16]  illegal but it's so it's so hard i think for us and and i'm including myself and him and you guys
[7992.16 --> 7998.32]  it's so hard for us to imagine that other people don't want to build a computer on the weekend
[7998.32 --> 8004.64]  that that is just the last thing that they want to do they want to go climb a mountain yeah or they
[8004.64 --> 8013.04]  want to go uh for dinner with friends in person or they whatever right they want a game on their
[8013.04 --> 8017.68]  playstation 5 on their portal which is a perfectly legitimate product to buy if it solves a problem for
[8017.68 --> 8025.68]  you yeah right like there's there's there's other things that other people prioritize other than
[8026.56 --> 8032.80]  doing things with their computers and with technology and so you know but but that doesn't mean that
[8033.84 --> 8038.56]  i don't love it and that i don't love sharing that excitement and that passion and seeing people
[8038.56 --> 8044.56]  appreciate the things that i spend my time on uh is really cool and you know hearing that was uh it was
[8044.56 --> 8050.32]  awesome it's a great video i think there's going to be a ton of float plane exclusives is it a amd tech
[8050.32 --> 8055.76]  upgrade no it's just just it's just uh we group we felt like doing a tech upgrade from eddie and we
[8055.76 --> 8063.84]  went and just got a random sponsor because uh it wasn't five thousand dollars i think the computer
[8064.88 --> 8071.28]  tower was five thousand dollars oh wow and we did man we did everything we did like monitors um better
[8071.28 --> 8076.56]  filming equipment better networking he's got a tv like we we decked him out because we were just like
[8076.56 --> 8083.28]  meddy's meddy's a bro yeah he's come out and collabed with us a couple of times asks nothing in return
[8083.84 --> 8091.84]  absolutely nothing other than the pleasure of our company and to hang out and make a video and you know
[8091.84 --> 8099.12]  get out of the office for a little bit and and like he's just a genuine dude yeah and for a long time
[8099.12 --> 8108.72]  too and so we were just like you know who'd be cool to just deck out meddy so we went for it um
[8108.72 --> 8114.56]  anyway it was a really long day though uh sorry dan are we supposed to be doing something we're
[8114.56 --> 8119.12]  supposed to play games i want to play games yeah okay adver games adver games i'm down
[8119.12 --> 8126.24]  you want to do your laptop's hdmi place you want that uh okay oh yes yes yes i understand in there
[8126.24 --> 8132.48]  yeah okay uh it'll work it'll be fine because of this thing being stuck down if you put it right
[8132.48 --> 8139.60]  there it won't press any buttons he set his daughter up with a framework laptop nice um okay
[8140.56 --> 8145.68]  and okay sure okay wait am i the only one playing luke doesn't play you can
[8145.68 --> 8152.24]  wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
[8154.80 --> 8160.80]  what a dick yeah it's all his fault i don't know who else worked on it but it's his fault
[8161.44 --> 8165.52]  uh okay i blame you dan it's the only few things that i get to torch you guys with
[8166.08 --> 8171.04]  um so preferential treatment i'm not feeling tortured i feel good
[8171.04 --> 8175.60]  unless this game is terrible and i'm the one getting f***ed
[8176.64 --> 8184.32]  hey hey um okay you never know so um yeah feel free to hit run and i will switch over to your
[8184.32 --> 8188.72]  laptop i'm already getting screwed over this is connected via bluetooth he's setting me up to fail
[8188.72 --> 8196.08]  oh yeah you know it all right oh here we go oh okay so what the challenge is to figure out who it was
[8196.08 --> 8204.32]  i mean coke probably wait is that the challenge i think so we have you may try to guess which brand
[8204.32 --> 8210.48]  sponsored each game uh can you even can you even move how am i supposed to play this oh there you go
[8210.48 --> 8214.40]  what's happening maybe we got this one for free so uh
[8214.40 --> 8222.80]  let's see while the game was meant to boost morale most employee recipients discarded their copies
[8223.60 --> 8230.96]  only 125 copies were distributed making it one of the rarest atari 2600 games to exist and actual
[8230.96 --> 8241.60]  copies of it have sold for 1825 dollars on ebay wow so this was an actual atari cartridge i'm i'm
[8241.60 --> 8247.76]  getting you watch me get the oh dang it watch me get the pp there we go
[8250.08 --> 8254.72]  those eyes look troublesome no those are you gonna get the thing those eyes are no problem is there a
[8254.72 --> 8264.48]  bonus for the hitting the pepsi logo probably oh coke what dang it get back here wait what's up with
[8264.48 --> 8268.32]  that yeah what what was up with that dang it
[8271.60 --> 8276.88]  dang it get over here oh no you gotta wait for the comeback you're not fast enough
[8277.76 --> 8286.96]  oh one more can he do it can he do it nicely done nicely done and then i just do it again
[8286.96 --> 8292.80]  forever you defeated you defeated the coke good good job does it even store your scores or anything
[8292.80 --> 8296.88]  i don't know i don't know well no it's adding to the score i got last time so i'm getting like
[8296.88 --> 8303.60]  a higher score for the second wave okay do you want to try the next one sure i guess yeah okay go back
[8303.60 --> 8304.32]  to the wine camp
[8304.32 --> 8316.48]  yeah linus linus successfully shot the pp uh okay uh sure thanks dan okay so do you want to do the
[8316.48 --> 8323.20]  next one luke i i don't sure i mean i i can do it too it doesn't matter yeah you know what just it's here
[8324.48 --> 8329.12]  all right so this one we actually have to guess because we don't actually know i guess this one is
[8329.12 --> 8335.12]  probably going to be a little bit more difficult if i'm being perfectly honest okay um so let's take
[8335.12 --> 8340.24]  this is something we would even know i don't know uh probably yeah definitely oh so let's go over to
[8340.24 --> 8352.64]  linus's laptop and we'll get this going lindaura so this game is called darkened sky okay where did you
[8352.64 --> 8358.08]  start from i loaded a game oh you didn't just start from the top i thought that i was supposed to
[8358.08 --> 8362.24]  probably know the game maybe i don't know that's what i would have thought i would definitely start
[8362.24 --> 8369.36]  a new game oh okay really yeah i mean this is only six minutes in dan really okay fine
[8372.72 --> 8379.52]  okay i can't figure out how to do anything i have drawn my weapon i'd start a new game i'm not sure how
[8379.52 --> 8385.68]  to swing it is there tutorial or something you regen is that hp in the bottom left you regen that really fast
[8385.68 --> 8395.20]  okay so what right right trigger is jump what are these controls dan it's uh it's supposed to be a
[8395.20 --> 8405.36]  gamecube controller uh okay i have never played on gamecube so i would have no way of no oh okay left
[8405.36 --> 8409.12]  trigger is this let me just see if i can get rid of here
[8409.12 --> 8419.28]  i mean this seems really good um you know what yeah get out of combat for a second or something oh
[8419.28 --> 8426.56]  okay i i proceeded down a gentle slope and well you were i think you were out of hp and you got
[8426.56 --> 8430.16]  oh was that the issue at the same time there there you go okay okay so i'm at the beginning of the game
[8430.16 --> 8441.68]  now i think so yeah oh look i got a secret a rune mine uh sure oh i wanted to whack him wow that
[8441.68 --> 8448.88]  voice acting i love it actually though necroth would call me dim sum right about now so an expert on
[8448.88 --> 8455.28]  okay food i happen to live out near his neck of eternal chaos i hitched a ride here with his minions
[8455.28 --> 8462.56]  minions great i just love me oh wow they're necroth special forces they know possibly orange
[8462.56 --> 8466.24]  discovery i'll give you a hint after the cutscene you don't want a hint okay
[8468.00 --> 8473.12]  the hood i love it let's just say he whose face may not be glimpsed and i have issues
[8473.76 --> 8481.36]  want my help yay or nay thinking of going with yay okay yeah that didn't really seem like that convincing
[8481.36 --> 8488.16]  a sales pitch to me i have a feeling necroth is supposed to be like the big giveaway i have no idea
[8490.64 --> 8494.32]  what the heck why was i swinging around so much when they weren't there and that
[8494.32 --> 8498.48]  what is this move okay i think double tapping is a heavy attack
[8502.80 --> 8509.20]  you know what i'm sorry dan but i just have no idea what's going on right now i would uh okay well
[8509.20 --> 8521.68]  another cutscene hold on oh that's right the orange thing orange thing oh the rune of power
[8526.40 --> 8530.80]  it's a power rune it's a magical rock it's a skittle it's a skittle
[8530.80 --> 8541.84]  what kind of subliminal nonsense did they think they were doing here so is that as explicit as it
[8541.84 --> 8550.32]  gets or is it like now that i'm not entirely sure about um it's skills it's technically well we've got
[8550.32 --> 8556.00]  some fun facts here it's technically not an adventure game or sorry adver game because the brand didn't
[8556.00 --> 8564.72]  pay simon and uh schuster simon and schuster paid a royalty on sales to use the brand so they they
[8564.72 --> 8570.16]  paid to have skittles as their runes of power it seems like i didn't know that that's absolutely messed
[8570.16 --> 8580.00]  up what sky is voiced by linda larkin best known as the voice of princess jasmine in disney's aladdin
[8580.00 --> 8589.12]  wow so this had at least some kind of a budget i mean it's not evident from what's happening right
[8589.12 --> 8595.92]  now a young girl named sky finds one of five brightly colored magical stones then embarks on a quest to
[8595.92 --> 8602.32]  collect all the stones searching for her missing mother and defeating the evil wizard necroff
[8602.32 --> 8611.76]  why are they skittles the game features a magic system based on the stones with different combinations
[8611.76 --> 8617.76]  of colors creating different spells the rainbow themed magic stones are in fact the branded product
[8618.64 --> 8624.96]  okay well i think that's um probably enough of that yeah probably yeah yep i'll go back to you guys
[8624.96 --> 8632.48]  that i just don't understand luke's face is phenomenal okay and the last one i've got for you
[8632.48 --> 8641.20]  you both actually get to play yay cool i think luke sounds very excited well yeah we've seen the quality
[8641.20 --> 8646.16]  of gameplay so far i need a different xbox controller i'm assuming this is connected to something what about
[8646.16 --> 8650.32]  second xbox controller why is this one not good second game
[8650.32 --> 8656.48]  oh
[8657.04 --> 8661.04]  luke wants some runes of power i actually don't i'm good with no runes of power
[8662.32 --> 8669.76]  oh okay let's see how do we do this uh the runes of power are this one candy cane themed handcuffs
[8671.12 --> 8672.64]  should try and play it with those on
[8675.12 --> 8679.12]  oh he's gonna do it isn't he you must have known that was gonna happen no the second you said that one
[8679.12 --> 8686.32]  of us is gonna end up wearing no i'm still not used to that i've been doing this for so long and
[8686.32 --> 8694.00]  i still forget the power of making comments like that i'm a little confused by this um okay this
[8694.00 --> 8700.96]  warning makes a lot of sense to me for adult novelty use only warning please discontinue if there is any
[8700.96 --> 8706.56]  discomfort for you or your partners age is 14 plus
[8709.36 --> 8717.76]  wait was partners pluralized oh yeah oh yeah ages 14 plus um yeah more than that please yeah
[8717.76 --> 8730.40]  wow these really are the exact same handcuffs that you could get at the dollar store when i was a
[8730.40 --> 8735.04]  child but with fuzz on them cheap fuzz on them and probably for like 15 dollars
[8735.68 --> 8741.92]  yeah 15 bucks exactly yeah why do you know how much these cost why do you know the price of novelty
[8741.92 --> 8747.60]  handcuffs by the way these are as small as the kid ones too they like barely fit even on me oh wow
[8747.92 --> 8752.96]  check mine let's see i i was able to do two clicks on mine without it being quite uncomfortable
[8752.96 --> 8753.76]  if you can do any
[8756.48 --> 8766.32]  oh oh just send it hold on is it is it in the hole no no it's not yeah it won't it won't close on him
[8766.32 --> 8768.64]  oh wait it's not in the hole yeah there you go you gotta spit on it
[8768.64 --> 8777.12]  no you can't you can't squeeze i know i was just messing with you yeah no i can't click it yeah i
[8777.12 --> 8781.44]  almost got it it was very close yeah i mean yeah my wrists are not huge and i can only do
[8781.44 --> 8790.40]  ow four really hurts i can do two comfortably okay let's get these on and uh prepare to play a game
[8790.40 --> 8791.76]  they're already falling apart
[8791.76 --> 8799.12]  hard you seem to be single use items ouch i mean realistically what were you gonna do wash them
[8802.08 --> 8807.44]  okay anyway uh all right let's uh let's go here yeah you're gonna play there there you go
[8807.44 --> 8813.60]  uh i think is that me on the left yeah dude you're booking it you've been booking it for the last
[8813.60 --> 8822.96]  three hours uh i guess wow i guess push start uh uh linus i think is is okay there you go
[8822.96 --> 8830.00]  you won safety first is this gonna run an obstacle course yeah is this like american ninja yeah exactly
[8840.88 --> 8841.52]  oh i see
[8843.92 --> 8848.48]  i don't a hundred percent understand exactly what we're supposed to be doing you gotta get to the
[8848.48 --> 8854.64]  end as fast as you can so this was a party game developed by uh developed for the xbox 360 and
[8854.64 --> 8859.92]  released for free on the double jump or like i think so uh you can also hold the left trigger to sprint
[8859.92 --> 8868.96]  too oh i think oh well man oh i didn't know about that freaking helped yeah uh okay so basically
[8869.76 --> 8875.52]  jumping is good i mean i'm so far behind luke that like really i feel like i'm not doing well
[8875.52 --> 8880.48]  there's tutorials in the background sometimes yeah i just didn't oh wow i fell into the water
[8881.28 --> 8885.84]  oh my goodness this is this is getting worse not better um
[8890.00 --> 8897.60]  okay how long are these courses though okay like i just i uh i am so far behind you dude
[8897.60 --> 8904.40]  i was stuck on one of the jumps for a very long time because i didn't know how to run yeah the the run
[8904.96 --> 8912.00]  helps a lot it do all right so yeah this is an american ninja warrior game basically it's inspired by
[8912.00 --> 8917.04]  that type of thing but the game was yeah i i i want to i want to see if i can guess who actually paid for
[8917.04 --> 8922.88]  it though oh yeah i mean i can continue uh sure i can continue giving some explanations but okay next level
[8922.88 --> 8927.36]  yeah if you want here we go you can have a guest you want to have a guest uh mine is american ninja
[8927.36 --> 8934.00]  warrior oh i got it i got it you got it oh yeah are those not american flags what are those flags it's
[8934.00 --> 8942.08]  doritos doritos we both wow that was awesome i was looking at the wrong screen yeah me too sure
[8943.12 --> 8947.60]  i mean both of them were doing the exact same thing luke so it's not really much of an excuse how'd you
[8947.60 --> 8953.20]  know it was doritos doritos is correct how did you know it was there was a tiny doritos ad in the
[8953.20 --> 8959.20]  in the background oh that's gross i didn't even see that yeah it was like very small like a little
[8959.84 --> 8963.68]  little pop-up doritos thing and then it went away
[8966.40 --> 8973.60]  yeah that's this is weird this is a weird no no no no there we go they seem to sponsor a bunch of
[8973.60 --> 8979.12]  different types of ad for games really so what i didn't get hit by it is that something that's
[8979.12 --> 8985.44]  happened recently or like i have absolutely no idea is this subliminal doritos yeah no i don't need
[8985.44 --> 8993.92]  the rope okay forget it uh oh i'm definitely losing this time uh i i'm probably not as far ahead as you
[8993.92 --> 9002.72]  might think or at all oh i just got clean how did i just do a cartwheel got friggin creamed boys
[9003.76 --> 9008.56]  there was cream involved oh i don't know if you want to say that while we're wearing you're wearing
[9008.56 --> 9013.12]  those sorry i mean it's not like they'd believe me if i said there wasn't
[9015.92 --> 9021.20]  okay so does the rope do something oh yeah sometimes my like controller shakes and i have no idea why
[9021.20 --> 9026.64]  and bad things happen uh i'm not at the bottom of the room too long i feel like really i think you might be
[9026.64 --> 9031.44]  sprinting for too long american ninja warriors would sprint the whole time so i don't know how real that is
[9031.44 --> 9037.92]  yeah did you win already i guess i thought you were ahead of me no man i i am not very good at
[9037.92 --> 9046.40]  games or this we're better than you say i mean yeah sure often i like the pose that my person chose to do
[9047.68 --> 9050.88]  i like that they put their their fist on their hip but there's a gap
[9050.88 --> 9059.92]  hey you did it wow look there's a gap oh i like that yeah that's good quality my guys are really
[9059.92 --> 9067.04]  happy for someone who came in last yeah doritos okay so here uh here's where i saw it on my screen
[9067.04 --> 9075.52]  it pops up right as we start the next level let's see yeah there it is very top left oh wow yeah that's
[9075.52 --> 9079.60]  pretty small and kind of like out of the way for time to win because luke wasn't ready
[9081.84 --> 9089.52]  yeah boys yeah boys what the oh i didn't grab the rope i'm screwed
[9089.52 --> 9100.16]  oh it's over no man i just fell like 300 feet to my doom down to slide down to slide down to slide
[9100.16 --> 9107.60]  i'm down to slide oh buddy game oh man it moves you back really far in this level
[9110.24 --> 9112.24]  i missed
[9112.24 --> 9114.24]  oh
[9116.24 --> 9121.04]  does it oh is that little helicopter thing the other player yeah that's that's luke yeah that's
[9121.04 --> 9128.40]  what oh what the oh dang oh a broken nose oh boy those hammer things i mean that time i definitely
[9128.40 --> 9134.96]  got hit by it but i often feel like i'm not i shouldn't get hit by it but i do it kind of feels like
[9134.96 --> 9142.00]  oh a bit of a we both just went off at the same time it kind of feels a little random like the speed that
[9142.00 --> 9149.04]  you have to go through the mat and the um the differences in timing and stuff are just i don't
[9149.04 --> 9156.00]  know man what the heck is going on here oh oh there's like the fast path of above and i didn't realize
[9156.00 --> 9163.68]  that yeah what what i can't even see oh there's a projectile my eyes are too bad i can't advantage linus
[9165.44 --> 9169.20]  he will not be able to take advantage of it oh i see what i was supposed to do
[9169.20 --> 9174.48]  whoo you're supposed to oh are you supposed to yeah you're supposed to slide i think i get it
[9176.56 --> 9184.40]  what is this how does this work oh boy um wow what just happened what just happened
[9188.00 --> 9193.52]  oh you can't slide when it's going that way that makes sense oh yeah please no
[9193.52 --> 9207.12]  nooo all right oh oh oh oh terrible oh all right i'm done all right gg and this came off
[9209.52 --> 9214.00]  you're just too strong i'm putting it back on this actually seems kind of fun
[9214.00 --> 9223.92]  well not bad the doritos doritos game it was all right yeah yeah darkened sky depending on when
[9223.92 --> 9230.56]  that was released i don't know um no it was pretty bad no it was pretty it was pretty clunky but it was
[9230.56 --> 9235.84]  you're supposed to be on like gamecube controllers and those are very different it looks a lot newer than um
[9235.84 --> 9244.16]  um um oh it's 2002 soul reaver legacy of kane and the controls of that are a lot better than
[9244.16 --> 9250.16]  darkened sky it also came out on pc as well i believe so did soul reaver legacy of kane perfect
[9251.60 --> 9257.28]  yeah no no man i've not played it sorry all right what are we supposed to be talking about now um we
[9257.28 --> 9264.72]  could do this week in ai that's up to you uh are there any other main topics though oh we did the amd
[9264.72 --> 9271.04]  overclocking thing should we talk about that or we didn't do rather yeah on monday chinese twitter user
[9271.04 --> 9279.20]  david huang posted a warning that popped up when he was enabling overclocking on his ryzen 7000 cpu
[9279.20 --> 9286.48]  which stated overclocking mode will now be permanently enabled for this processor effectively voiding
[9286.48 --> 9293.12]  warranty as previously stated wow that's pretty brutal in response to user concern amd published a
[9293.12 --> 9300.56]  reaffirmation that overclocking does not void a cpu's warranties enabling overclocking does however
[9300.56 --> 9307.44]  blow a hidden fuse to indicate that overclocking has been used at some point in the chip's history
[9307.44 --> 9310.64]  and overclocking damage itself is not covered
[9313.04 --> 9319.36]  however an overclocked chip is still covered by warranty or repair for other unrelated issues
[9319.36 --> 9330.80]  okay okay okay then so basically we'll do it but only if we say that the damage yeah was not caused by
[9330.80 --> 9338.80]  overclocking which realistically i can tell you having seen the kind of equipment that these brands use
[9339.44 --> 9345.60]  to determine like a low level error in these chips they are not pulling that out for every single
[9345.60 --> 9356.80]  stupid rma it's a dead chip that's that that that that's it um so basically the only reason for this
[9356.80 --> 9366.72]  fuse to exist is an easy flag is if they will it's it's like it's like putting moisture sensors in your
[9366.72 --> 9374.64]  phone yeah and then saying but it's fine if you get liquid in it we will honor your warranty um i mean to be
[9374.64 --> 9384.24]  clear i don't think amd has given us any indication yet that they intend to do anything with this flag
[9384.24 --> 9391.60]  with this fuse that can be blown but the fact that they have it at all indicates that they felt they
[9391.60 --> 9397.04]  needed it and the fact that they felt they needed it seems to indicate that they might feel they would
[9397.04 --> 9404.40]  need to use it at some point and i just i have a hard time imagining how they could tell the difference
[9404.40 --> 9410.96]  between a clock that a clock a chip that failed prematurely because it was overclocked or a chip
[9410.96 --> 9418.48]  that failed prematurely because it just failed prematurely the flag would not change anything about
[9418.48 --> 9424.96]  that other than to tell them that you overclocked it at which point they could say at their discretion
[9424.96 --> 9428.24]  it failed prematurely because you overclocked it um
[9428.24 --> 9434.40]  um yeah it's a little sketch definitely a little sketch
[9436.64 --> 9442.48]  l erald doe says i think it's fair it tells them to look for signs of overcurrent or over voltage damage
[9442.48 --> 9449.52]  and if they find it they could void your warranty but again i gotta tell you they are not doing that
[9449.52 --> 9457.76]  level of analysis on your like 400 cpu to you that's a lot of money to a company like amd it is not it is
[9457.76 --> 9467.04]  actually not worth the time to take a technician and do a a micro level analysis like nano level
[9467.04 --> 9473.76]  analysis on this chip and determine if you overclocked it or not because yeah if there could be some
[9473.76 --> 9481.36]  visually very obvious versions of that but there's also a bunch of not yeah also i i want to mention
[9481.36 --> 9485.60]  about crash course a bunch of people are saying that like it was actually a big thing for like them
[9485.60 --> 9490.48]  and their friends growing up that was decently fun yeah i i it seemed pretty fun to me yeah yeah
[9491.20 --> 9494.72]  we're trying to dog that i think we were more commenting on the other ones because they were like
[9495.36 --> 9499.76]  it's four player as well it's a four player couch co-op that's pretty sick that's pretty good that
[9499.76 --> 9506.00]  would have gotten some use if i had that when i was younger for sure no doubt if you the the demo of
[9506.00 --> 9511.92]  fusion frenzy got busted out of my house like all the time so yeah that definitely would have gotten some use
[9511.92 --> 9522.16]  the sliding actually added a surprising amount to the fun um but yeah anyway should we move on from
[9522.16 --> 9526.72]  that it's an important topic to bring up but i don't think there's a ton of discussion e3 is officially
[9526.72 --> 9535.20]  dead yeah was that the one no actually okay well it's dead which is sort of um was a surprise to me
[9535.20 --> 9540.72]  because i didn't realize it was still alive i thought it was dead already i don't know why i
[9540.72 --> 9546.80]  thought that but i definitely did yeah i i just i i i thought it was just already settled that ea
[9547.44 --> 9555.44]  ea excuse me e3 was not a thing anymore yeah so cool taking place since 2019 it was cancelled entirely
[9555.44 --> 9563.76]  in 2020 2022 and 2023 um what possible expo could continue to survive after not being an expo for
[9563.76 --> 9574.40]  um three years yeah yeah okay well anyway um rip e3 i guess i guess the game awards now is where
[9574.40 --> 9580.48]  everyone does that stuff or their own events i think that yeah online announcements stuff like that yeah
[9580.48 --> 9586.64]  honestly i'm pretty supportive of online announcements yeah why exactly is it that nintendo directs
[9586.64 --> 9598.56]  are great why do we burn like like tons upon tons of jet fuel to bring people to look at a present
[9598.56 --> 9604.96]  like powerpoint like i just i'm sorry i just i can't fathom it i don't understand it yeah yeah nintendo
[9604.96 --> 9610.32]  directs seriously i i wish more companies did nintendo direct style things because they're awesome
[9610.32 --> 9624.16]  anyways um should we talk about uh ubiquity yeah ubiquity customers trade security cameras starting
[9624.16 --> 9629.44]  early wednesday users of ubiquity networking devices have been reporting that they can see and receive
[9629.44 --> 9635.60]  notifications from other users devices through ubiquity's unify cloud portal this was flagged by a
[9635.60 --> 9641.92]  reddit user whose wife received a notification from a unify protect alongside a picture from someone
[9641.92 --> 9648.40]  else's security camera another user logged into the unify site manager and found 88 devices that's a lot
[9648.40 --> 9653.76]  that did not belong to them yet another user logged in and found that they had full access to someone
[9653.76 --> 9661.20]  else's udm pro once the users refreshed the portal page they were shown only the devices associated with
[9661.20 --> 9666.64]  their own accounts following investigation ubiquity has issued a statement saying that this bug was
[9666.64 --> 9673.52]  caused by a misconfiguration in an upgrade to the unify cloud infrastructure according to ubiquity only
[9673.52 --> 9679.36]  12 accounts were inappropriately accessed and affected users will be contacted the problem has been fixed
[9679.36 --> 9688.08]  but is still under investigation again that is uh ubiquity statement um this is bad yeah discussion
[9688.08 --> 9692.00]  question how big is the risk of our security devices getting compromised and used against us
[9692.00 --> 9702.16]  why do we use them anyways um the risk is big they're a huge target um yeah and we've talked a ton of
[9702.16 --> 9708.72]  times on the show about how you should never really consider um anything that goes on the internet
[9710.08 --> 9717.44]  100 bulletproof yeah like it you can try to do whatever you can to resist against it but if it goes
[9717.44 --> 9722.64]  onto the internet there's a way that other people can get it realistically someone's probably seen my
[9722.64 --> 9729.84]  ding dong at some point dennis oh yeah i mean well i mean aside from dennis
[9736.16 --> 9744.08]  in other news google stops snitching google is changing how it handles data from the maps app so the
[9744.08 --> 9749.68]  company will no longer have access to users individual location histories that means google
[9749.68 --> 9755.36]  will no longer be able to answer geofence warrants so these are warrants that compel the company to
[9755.36 --> 9760.88]  disclose the information of anyone who was in the approximate location of a crime at the rough time
[9760.88 --> 9767.04]  that it was committed nearly all geofence warrants in the u.s are addressed to google and they represent
[9767.04 --> 9774.00]  25 percent of the warrants google gets every year we have some discussion questions here but i actually
[9774.00 --> 9779.44]  have a different discussion question that i want to talk about do you think that this has anything
[9779.44 --> 9786.40]  to do with protecting their users or do you think hold on can you just let me finish the question geez
[9787.04 --> 9794.32]  or do you think that it has more to do with google just not wanting to do the administrative paperwork
[9794.32 --> 9800.96]  of responding to these warrants oh yeah absolutely because there's no way it's simple there's like there's no
[9800.96 --> 9807.92]  way yeah it's legal yeah it doesn't generate revenue touch legal stuff it's annoying as heck
[9808.56 --> 9815.36]  uh and then yeah it's definitely it's definitely not generating revenue um wow my uh nose plugged
[9815.36 --> 9823.28]  there my voice got all weird but um yeah i don't know i'm not surprised at all this is probably a good
[9823.28 --> 9827.92]  thing because companies just collecting insane amounts of data about us is like not great
[9827.92 --> 9834.48]  so the fact that it's happening the right thing for probably the wrong reasons yeah yeah because
[9834.48 --> 9839.52]  if they were if they were into the whole user privacy thing they wouldn't have done this in the first
[9839.52 --> 9846.80]  place yeah so they never were yeah um and there's definitely no way they're not now can i just take a moment to
[9846.80 --> 9855.92]  say can you imagine committing a crime with your phone on you i mean obviously you know he seems like stuff happens or whatever but like yo leave that at home
[9855.92 --> 9858.80]  leave that at home
[9859.52 --> 9866.00]  like leave what were they doing i don't know play music put on table leave oh he's listening to music yeah
[9867.44 --> 9874.56]  man it seems like the lowest level like most obvious things but you know yeah there's the whole criminals
[9874.56 --> 9880.24]  are dumb thing yeah i mean the smart criminals probably are doing pretty good for themselves like anything
[9880.24 --> 9887.28]  right there there there's the there's the cream and then there's the crud um but yeah just some some
[9887.28 --> 9894.40]  advice free of charge i'm not a lawyer if you're gonna crime leave the phone or you'll do the time you know
[9896.96 --> 9904.64]  oh my goodness uh the day before launches then the day after departs oh yeah this one i
[9904.64 --> 9912.88]  uh other than other than this game being um just sort of a disaster i i don't really know anything
[9912.88 --> 9920.00]  about this did you try the game no i hadn't even heard about this until i thought it was the game that
[9920.00 --> 9927.84]  like goat had exposed um because uh we we've talked about goat moth a few times on the show around like
[9927.84 --> 9934.48]  tarkov stuff but he started doing like video game journalism stuff after that and he did something on a
[9934.64 --> 9941.68]  on a military game that sounded somewhat similar that was a huge scam so i assumed this was that
[9941.68 --> 9946.96]  but it's not it's apparently some other one oh okay and now it's gone already like this whole thing
[9946.96 --> 9954.40]  happened so fast i didn't even have time to like notice that it happened i all i saw was was news about
[9954.40 --> 9963.60]  how it got taken off the store and the company disappeared yeah nothing else and like the stuff that i read
[9963.60 --> 9968.32]  was like that they were planning on giving everyone refunds even if they're above the two-hour threshold
[9968.32 --> 9971.92]  and that they were like closing their company down so i was like okay this sounds like the story's
[9971.92 --> 9978.48]  very over but people keep the work i mean we're talking about it right now yeah so well that was it
[9978.48 --> 9984.16]  yeah cool um ban show after dark yeah no you can't say bye then i'll have to end the show oh i meant by
[9984.16 --> 9990.80]  way to go luke i'm hitting the button luke has ended the show i meant by to like the oh no oh no oh
[9990.80 --> 9996.24]  that's actually really difficult to fix what no i hit the button uh if i hit the button it's different
[9996.24 --> 10001.28]  that wasn't the merch message okay we'll see if the timing works i know i know but oh it doesn't
[10001.28 --> 10005.44]  matter did i break something does that button actually send the dashboard i don't think so
[10005.44 --> 10010.64]  it's uh did you make it do that i don't know if you see letters appear that'll be kind of interesting
[10012.08 --> 10013.52]  letters appear oh
[10016.56 --> 10024.24]  letters yeah yeah oh okay yeah the sponsors just like might show up at some okay well that's cool
[10025.44 --> 10031.20]  they'll be the after dark sponsors yeah uh it looks okay i think i think it should have shown up by now
[10031.20 --> 10037.12]  dan yeah they will definitely come and go they'll come they will definitely come and go yeah if
[10037.12 --> 10041.20]  they're gonna come at all oh i see you know what i mean oh yeah okay because it's all an automated
[10041.20 --> 10048.88]  timing thing all right hit me dan all right let me sit down geez okay let's see uh what's a good way
[10048.88 --> 10055.84]  to convince a loved one to let me set them up with a server to keep their over 500 000 photos uh
[10055.84 --> 10062.88]  instead of keeping them on their desk on top of 20-ish flash drives don't because now it'll be your
[10062.88 --> 10071.36]  responsibility when ultimately someone who has extremely poor data hygiene loses something
[10073.76 --> 10078.64]  they obviously aren't willing to put in the work and you can't save people from themselves and
[10078.64 --> 10082.16]  realistically in a hundred years you'll both be dead and none of those pictures will matter
[10082.16 --> 10092.16]  so don't worry about it sorry little dose of land show after really dark yeah jeez
[10094.08 --> 10096.00]  are the toques coming back at some point
[10099.04 --> 10104.96]  dan's like let's get out of this way oh boy i'm saving luke from this thank you
[10104.96 --> 10118.96]  don't think about it the void how about some toques
[10121.28 --> 10126.96]  it's cold in the void do you want your head to be warmer when you're in the void sorry why are we
[10126.96 --> 10130.80]  talking about toques is that a merch message yeah yeah it is actually a merch message there's
[10130.80 --> 10137.04]  toques on the store right now aren't there so then yes they're back immediately nice what are they
[10137.04 --> 10141.68]  not i don't know i don't know either it's hard to type like yeah i'll figure it out no i got this
[10142.40 --> 10149.84]  okay uh are they clothing are they hats are they gear is gear hats one of these days i don't think
[10149.84 --> 10157.76]  there's a category for them accessories is it a top a beanie it's a beanie that's an accessory apparently
[10157.76 --> 10164.40]  that's a toque they say sold out notify me when available oh wow we do oh we bonus binned away a
[10164.40 --> 10171.12]  lot of these um every single color oh okay i don't know uh linus uh you gotta replug that hdmi cord i
[10171.12 --> 10172.40]  think oh well there's your problem right there
[10175.28 --> 10180.88]  yeah every single one notify me when available okay well uh i don't know because they this is an
[10180.88 --> 10186.16]  item that wasn't selling particularly well and we took an absolute bath on during black friday cyber
[10186.16 --> 10191.68]  monday to clear them out i i did talk to nick about how next time around we might want to for
[10191.68 --> 10197.36]  things that are selling a little bit but slowly we might want to just not blow away every single unit
[10197.36 --> 10201.68]  but hold on to like a couple hundred so that we have stock for a little bit and people can still
[10201.68 --> 10206.56]  buy them if they feel like it uh but that's not how that went down we blew away every single one and
[10206.56 --> 10212.96]  so now they're gone and whether we bring them back in or not really depends um maybe on a color by
[10212.96 --> 10217.84]  color basis we'd look at the ones that were moving pretty well still but there was a lot of colors
[10217.84 --> 10225.12]  yeah i i think that if we bring back toques maybe we'll kind of reinvigorate them a little bit somehow
[10225.12 --> 10230.32]  because i feel like they moved really well out for a long time and then i think i don't know maybe just
[10230.32 --> 10237.12]  all of you have toques now i'm not sure that makes sense yeah all right okay let's swing the other way
[10237.12 --> 10242.32]  again uh with the discussion of minors on the internet and explicit content on websites like
[10242.32 --> 10248.00]  twitch and twitter how much of this would be mitigated if parents properly monitored what their
[10248.00 --> 10254.64]  kids watched online well here's another question how much of the trouble in the world would be
[10254.64 --> 10258.88]  mitigated if god was watching and did something about it
[10258.88 --> 10269.52]  i guess what i'm trying to say is what is happening human's gonna human just just end after dark now
[10269.52 --> 10277.04]  the cuffs have unlocked something they've become too powerful what if nothing in the universe
[10277.04 --> 10277.44]  mattered
[10279.92 --> 10282.48]  be nice to each other you think i'm restrained
[10282.48 --> 10290.88]  i've never been more free i just mean people are people are gonna people right and kids are just
[10290.88 --> 10296.40]  little people and there is no such thing as perfect parental supervision and if there was perfect
[10296.40 --> 10303.04]  parental supervision um i think that you would be potentially stunting your kids i mean one of our
[10303.04 --> 10311.20]  kids is probably too honest and so we've had to start having conversations that go hey um sometimes
[10311.20 --> 10316.72]  it is actually a very valuable life skill to be able to hold your cards a little bit closer to your
[10316.72 --> 10324.00]  chest and we're not telling you to lie cheat and steal what we're telling you is that um things take tact
[10324.96 --> 10331.28]  yeah sometimes just the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth is not the best way to
[10331.28 --> 10337.04]  handle a situation for everyone involved um and
[10337.04 --> 10349.76]  having a little bit of discretion can actually be valuable so i uh yeah i i don't think that the
[10349.76 --> 10357.76]  right approach is to completely protect kids from anything that could be harmful to them necessarily so
[10357.76 --> 10366.24]  i yeah i just i i don't know if i agree with the question um i i uh i also don't i also don't
[10366.24 --> 10372.80]  disagree with the overall premise that parents should take some responsibility for what their
[10372.80 --> 10378.64]  kids are exposed to and and part of taking responsibility is not necessarily you know
[10378.64 --> 10384.00]  putting up a perfect barrier that prevents anything bad from happening or any bad exposure but talking
[10384.00 --> 10389.76]  to them and dealing with it and you know that's the ideal situation in my mind is things happen and
[10389.76 --> 10396.08]  life happens and life's complicated and people are people are messy right but you you work through it
[10396.08 --> 10406.16]  and and you deal with it are any more luxe items coming keep them coming would love a matching sling
[10406.16 --> 10412.72]  or duffel bag i think we're going to see how the luxe backpack does uh pre-sales are okay and once it's
[10412.72 --> 10419.12]  actually in stock and shipping i do think sales will pick up uh if we hit a certain threshold then yeah
[10419.12 --> 10424.24]  i think you'll see more luxe items from us it's a really cool material this apple leather i was blown away
[10424.24 --> 10429.04]  by how good it is but i think that this is one of those things where just because i say it doesn't
[10429.04 --> 10432.96]  mean you should believe everything i say right i i've told you guys so many times in the past you've
[10432.96 --> 10437.92]  got to consider everyone's motivation right what's in it for them obviously what's in it for me is you
[10437.92 --> 10444.88]  buying a 600 backpack so sure you know you could trust me but verify and i think the way to verify is
[10444.88 --> 10451.60]  to wait for those those early orderers to give their independent opinions and then if it's the kind of
[10451.60 --> 10456.64]  product you would consider go for it yeah and you know once we once we see some momentum there yeah
[10456.64 --> 10462.08]  i could see us developing more i think it's a great material but we need to see a willingness from the
[10462.08 --> 10475.44]  audience to to engage with our brand in that way it's a premium product it does cost us a lot more in
[10475.44 --> 10479.52]  materials and workmanship to make than the regular bag that's why that's why the price is a lot higher
[10479.52 --> 10485.60]  um but just because something costs more doesn't mean that people are willing to doesn't mean people
[10485.60 --> 10490.40]  have the perception of that brand that they should have the right to have a product that costs that
[10490.40 --> 10496.08]  much more uh you know maybe if they if you have 600 to spend on a backpack you'd rather buy from like
[10496.08 --> 10500.32]  an established you know luxury brand or fashion brand or whatever else it is and that's totally your
[10500.32 --> 10505.28]  prerogative right so we just need to see if um if that's something that we can build towards if we can
[10505.28 --> 10511.20]  build these luxury goods these um very very high-end products and it's going to be a bit of a journey
[10511.84 --> 10514.64]  or it'll be over you know we're open-minded
[10519.12 --> 10519.92]  that was pretty good
[10522.08 --> 10526.08]  small clap i love it the margin percentage is about the same to the person who asked
[10527.12 --> 10533.04]  can we please have an update on the screwdriver holster i work in maintenance for over 80 apartments and 30
[10533.04 --> 10542.00]  villas and i carry the screwdriver with me every day um no we got nothing right now but
[10544.16 --> 10546.80]  we have pants um
[10548.80 --> 10554.48]  this is going to be really hard my headphone goes through here and i need to reach my backpack
[10557.68 --> 10558.00]  i can
[10563.36 --> 10566.96]  this is a lot harder to maneuver with than i anticipated don't we take your headphones off
[10566.96 --> 10570.08]  for you um you'd think with all my practice i'd be able to
[10573.04 --> 10576.40]  that tracks just handling different objects in those scenarios yeah
[10578.24 --> 10580.56]  i mean when you're working something with both hands
[10581.12 --> 10583.68]  it doesn't matter that you can't separate them you know yeah
[10583.68 --> 10589.36]  oh my god i already had a screwdriver in my
[10591.92 --> 10595.76]  anyway the point is um our cargo pants
[10596.88 --> 10602.80]  they have a screwdriver are going to have a screwdriver pocket oh it goes point down yes because otherwise
[10602.80 --> 10608.48]  the point will the one on this sample is too small uh we're still working on that but if you have it
[10608.48 --> 10613.84]  point up but the pockets in the right place for it to be ergonomic then it'll stab you in the stomach
[10613.84 --> 10619.52]  if you have a bit of a gut um so we we want we're we're aiming point down and so it'll be there and
[10619.52 --> 10623.76]  it'll kind of stick up and you'll sleep you'll pull it out like that yeah anyway it's in the it's
[10623.76 --> 10628.80]  in the larger cargo pocket for me right now because this sample of the pants it doesn't go in properly
[10628.80 --> 10631.92]  yeah our cargo pants are gonna be awesome
[10633.52 --> 10641.36]  do do i dear ldl what ltd product did you think would be great until the last minute where it
[10641.36 --> 10648.56]  turned out to be a horrible idea also can't wait for the shaft mine is stubby a horrible idea
[10651.28 --> 10656.72]  um horrible horrible's a big word
[10658.80 --> 10665.92]  yeah i curated this one i think you could interpret it as like didn't end up doing as
[10665.92 --> 10674.40]  well as you thought maybe not horrible oh um this is one that i was personally kind of opposed to but
[10674.40 --> 10681.36]  we did anyway the uh the meme face desk pads were kind of a disaster uh they they didn't sell
[10681.36 --> 10686.24]  particularly well i think we gave away as many as we sold how did the sequin pillows do not very well
[10686.24 --> 10693.36]  yeah okay yeah we kind of we kind of pivoted away from meme products and into what we think we're
[10693.36 --> 10698.40]  really good at which is serious products that are just really good phone cables taking it off slowly
[10699.12 --> 10699.60]  just so you know
[10701.92 --> 10704.56]  there we go thanks no no problem serious company
[10706.24 --> 10710.08]  well if they fall off then you become indecent and we can't have that that's what
[10710.08 --> 10717.04]  then the show ends that's important luke is protecting yeah yeah uh sorry i got distracted
[10717.04 --> 10725.92]  by linus's um sorry uh good morning dan linus and luke are there any things that you haven't done or made
[10725.92 --> 10731.60]  because you believed that your significant other disapproved of it but they actually never said anything
[10731.60 --> 10741.04]  about it oh wow interesting uh yvonne and i are very open with each other we are like mind meld at
[10741.04 --> 10746.64]  this point we've been together 18 years we've done absolutely everything together yeah we've been we've
[10746.64 --> 10754.64]  been together more than we've not been together in our lives uh including like infancy so um to say
[10754.64 --> 10762.80]  that we barely even remember life without each other would be true um in both cases i um
[10766.80 --> 10775.84]  i watch movies and tv shows you know where the entire the entire premise of of the conflict of the
[10775.84 --> 10782.32]  story could have been resolved by just being honest with your spouse about that you lost your job or you
[10782.32 --> 10788.08]  know whatever and i just kind of i kind of have a really hard time watching because even though i
[10788.08 --> 10796.32]  know that these are yelling at the tv yeah yeah just if yeah if you if you felt that way just say
[10796.32 --> 10802.08]  something because this could be resolved in like four minutes you know everyone has a good cry and then you
[10802.64 --> 10805.52]  resolve to do better going forward like i just i um
[10805.52 --> 10815.28]  i can't i don't get it yeah yeah viscous creed this was the whole plot of aladdin 100 like it's
[10815.28 --> 10820.80]  it's real hard for me to watch and the funny thing is we all grow up with these stories and we all see
[10820.80 --> 10827.12]  how problematic it is and we all do it um and and to and to be honest with you like outside of my
[10827.12 --> 10832.40]  relationship with yvonne yeah i withhold things that probably cause problems and and then it causes
[10832.40 --> 10839.44]  problems like we're again humans we're messy right um but with yvonne no i actually i can't say that i
[10839.44 --> 10843.04]  can think of a time that that's happened maybe she could she's she's always better at remembering
[10843.04 --> 10852.72]  things i've done wrong are you uh you can ask her now yeah i was thinking okay
[10852.72 --> 10864.32]  hey lady you're on the wan show oh hey what's up which means you're on speaker yeah i mean the last
[10864.32 --> 10868.80]  person found that confusing and it's a life broadcast seemed pretty self-explanatory to me but okay yeah
[10868.80 --> 10876.96]  um question for you oh the merch message is gone um crap uh uh what is something that you didn't do
[10876.96 --> 10885.04]  uh that you and it would have been okay but can you think of something that i didn't do because
[10885.04 --> 10889.60]  i thought you wouldn't like it but then it turned out like you never said anything about it and you
[10889.60 --> 10900.24]  didn't care oh man um like a like a miscommunication or like a misunderstanding like somewhere i was like
[10900.24 --> 10904.40]  oh i i'm not gonna do that because like yvonne wouldn't like it but actually you didn't care and
[10904.40 --> 10910.40]  you never said anything about it oh well there was one the other day in the staff meeting where
[10910.40 --> 10914.96]  you said you chose family instead of cooperation and i was like oh i don't care about that
[10916.56 --> 10922.96]  oh okay i mean i was i was also just like mostly joking with you about that but okay can you think
[10922.96 --> 10927.52]  of anything like bigger we did these hold on hold on one sec we did these like personality assessment
[10927.52 --> 10932.96]  things with the executive team and we had to choose like three things we valued most and compared to
[10932.96 --> 10939.28]  cooperation i chose family which had a very similar description it was like valuing relationships
[10939.28 --> 10945.12]  something something something and um i basically was like yeah i picked family over that one because
[10945.12 --> 10949.44]  they're kind of synonymous but i i figured you'd kill me if i didn't pick family i was mostly just joking
[10949.44 --> 10960.80]  with her um okay anything else um are you talking about like in our relationship or
[10960.80 --> 10965.20]  sure anything for like anything it's wancho after dark there's nothing's off limits i guess
[10968.56 --> 10976.32]  man i'm in handcuffs right now fuzzy ones i said i'm in fuzzy handcuffs right now and he's wearing pasties
[10976.88 --> 10984.16]  that's not an expression that's literal yeah i can't really hear luke uh and he's wearing pasties
[10984.16 --> 10989.12]  i don't think she knows what pasties are what are pasties it's okay don't worry about it
[10992.16 --> 10994.08]  you're a wonderful person i love you very much
[10998.24 --> 11002.32]  um no what i was gonna say was after this call i'm probably gonna think of all kinds of things but i
[11002.32 --> 11007.60]  can't think of anything right now all right cool perfect that works for me okay all right thanks
[11007.60 --> 11009.52]  love okay goodbye
[11015.68 --> 11022.72]  dude i i can tell with like 95 accuracy when yvonne is not gonna know a word because almost anything
[11022.72 --> 11028.24]  related to that i'm the one who explained it to her so if i didn't explain it to her she doesn't know
[11028.24 --> 11039.04]  about it oh man she's so wholesome oh boy oh sheesh um did you guess all of mine when we were doing
[11039.04 --> 11044.32]  that exercise while i was picking them i was like i feel like i should throw in some curveball so that
[11044.32 --> 11049.12]  linus doesn't just automatically guess everything i knew you were gonna have something about determination
[11049.84 --> 11054.08]  obviously the the only thing that i thought might throw you off is like uh about
[11054.08 --> 11060.32]  like every three things were the same as the third previous like yeah there were a lot of kind of
[11060.32 --> 11064.80]  synonymous things when i say cooperation and family were the same it's because like the description of
[11064.80 --> 11071.84]  them was kind of similar because this was in like a work context so family was like like building each
[11071.84 --> 11076.48]  other up and cooperation was working together towards a common goal there's also like teamwork yeah
[11076.48 --> 11083.20]  exactly and like yeah there was only actually really like 10 selections yeah but there was like 50 so i knew
[11083.20 --> 11089.36]  you were gonna have something about just like getting her done yeah um i knew you were gonna have
[11090.16 --> 11095.44]  something about like loyalty yeah um i don't remember which version of that i chose but again
[11095.44 --> 11099.20]  there was like five of them and then the thing i already said which i forget what it was um
[11101.28 --> 11106.32]  whatever yeah so you basically yeah yeah of course yeah i mean like we we've been married almost
[11106.32 --> 11115.04]  as long as yvonne and i have so i i'm pretty sure i guessed yours and i even guessed how you would
[11115.04 --> 11121.76]  like sassily present them which was which was very satisfying while i was like sitting there listening
[11121.76 --> 11129.12]  i was like yeah so it's nice to see you guys can still keep it interesting you know in the business
[11129.12 --> 11135.04]  room yeah yeah yeah uh i've got one for luke here if linus you want to look through some of the
[11135.04 --> 11143.20]  potentials it's up to you hey dll this one is for luke hold on hold on i have to read this out oh no um
[11144.64 --> 11152.16]  ariel our co-op student oh boy just posted in the float plane chat yeah not going to bed angry has
[11152.16 --> 11156.96]  been a rule in our relationship for at least four years and a few months ago my girlfriend asked me where
[11156.96 --> 11167.76]  i got it from had to tell her it was from linus which made us both laugh oh my god oh ariel you're
[11167.76 --> 11174.08]  a gem that's pretty good okay dan hit me uh this one's for luke you don't get hit you can read the
[11174.08 --> 11180.32]  potentials hey dillo this one's for luke with a company's aggressively copywriting code algorithms and
[11180.32 --> 11186.24]  numbers will teachers eventually be unable to teach certain concepts or problems due to copyright
[11186.80 --> 11193.76]  well sorry this is for you i'm sorry i don't i don't think they'll have a problem with it um
[11195.12 --> 11199.36]  go for it nope no i want you to do it we can do it collaboratively i want you to do this one together
[11199.36 --> 11203.44]  i just know you're gonna have a different angle than me so you should just go first and then it'll
[11203.44 --> 11208.08]  be fine because i can just say my my part uh i don't think a cop copyright is that big of a deal in
[11208.08 --> 11216.64]  schools um and i think schools should be focusing on teaching you know skills like we we didn't just
[11216.64 --> 11221.92]  become unable to teach math because of calculators that whole conversation so i i think it'll be fine
[11221.92 --> 11226.72]  there are already teachers that are adapting he touched on it fair use um the the nature of the
[11226.72 --> 11231.60]  use matters a lot and you can get away with a lot if it's for the purposes of educating the second you
[11231.60 --> 11237.20]  throw education on there uh not only is it generally okay but also most companies are just
[11237.76 --> 11242.24]  okay with it at that yeah you just because remember there's a big difference between what's legally
[11242.24 --> 11249.84]  allowed and what a company is likely to pursue litigation for like technically you could make
[11249.84 --> 11256.08]  the argument that particularly in a sponsored piece of content which is commercial content um us
[11256.72 --> 11262.32]  uh putting up a video okay let's say it was a sponsored piece of content on a great monitor or tv
[11262.32 --> 11268.80]  and we were to put up disney's encanto on the screen you could make the argument that that's not
[11268.80 --> 11273.20]  editorial which would be far more protected like educational use you could make the argument that
[11273.20 --> 11280.32]  it's more commercial because we are making this video for the purpose of um of educating about the
[11280.32 --> 11289.44]  display sure but through the lens of a manufacturer sponsored piece of content however the context in
[11289.44 --> 11296.72]  which we're using the content is obviously positive about the why on earth did we have it on the screen
[11297.60 --> 11303.52]  because disney's not the one who gave us any money it's the display manufacturer who did and so the
[11303.52 --> 11309.28]  context of us having this content on the screen is that we think it's a great piece of content for showing off
[11309.28 --> 11317.84]  a great display and is is makes everything look beautiful why would disney pursue
[11318.88 --> 11325.92]  a lawsuit against me yeah for saying wow this movie is so great that it is the thing that makes sense
[11325.92 --> 11330.32]  for us to put on the most beautiful of displays that we are trying to make look as beautiful as possible
[11331.20 --> 11338.16]  so yeah from a legal standpoint if they decided that they had a gigantic rod up their butt and they
[11338.16 --> 11344.32]  wanted to go after us sure they might be able to do that it would be costly it would be an inordinate
[11344.32 --> 11352.08]  waste of time and at the end of the day all we were doing was presenting their content in a positive
[11352.08 --> 11357.20]  light and coming to one of the other pillars of fair use the impact on the market for the original work
[11358.00 --> 11362.48]  increasing the market for the original work by showing off the content like it's just
[11362.48 --> 11367.68]  it's silliness it's a bit of a gray area because of that whole impact and how you have to fair use
[11367.68 --> 11373.04]  as a defense and blah blah blah and all this stuff but just why it's also going to look horrible
[11373.92 --> 11378.24]  company goes after like a school and nintendo doesn't care about that sort of thing but
[11378.24 --> 11386.96]  most do and there is a degree of common sense in the law common sense would dictate that if in a
[11386.96 --> 11392.16]  non-negative way somebody is using your copyrighted content in a way that has no impact on the
[11392.16 --> 11403.36]  enjoyment of the original paid work um it's probably better to just ignore it um so so honestly we we
[11403.36 --> 11410.08]  have we have used copyrighted content to show off displays extensively in editorial content and sponsored
[11410.08 --> 11416.80]  content and my attitude towards it has been i mean realistically what we just have a war chest
[11416.96 --> 11423.60]  if somebody ever decides that they are stupid enough to go after us for it then we either fight
[11423.60 --> 11430.64]  it or we settle or we do whatever but at the end of the day what do people care about when they're
[11430.64 --> 11435.84]  buying a tv when they're buying a monitor they care about what their con what beautiful great content is
[11435.84 --> 11439.76]  going to look like on it and that's going to be whatever the latest games and movies are so that's
[11439.76 --> 11444.16]  what we're just going to put on them and we'll figure it out if this ever a problem
[11446.96 --> 11454.96]  hey lld linus after doing lmg for over 15 years what would your answer to linus who are you
[11456.88 --> 11460.96]  what would your answer be what would your answer i mean yeah all i have to do is go to my twitter profile
[11460.96 --> 11477.60]  here we go i'm a privateer father of children maker of youtube videos player of badminton canadian

[11491.28 --> 11498.24]  uh yeah i don't know that's a bit of a cop-out answer um oh you already you marked it you marked
[11498.24 --> 11504.24]  it resolved okay well apparently it's a good answer now ticket closed i have metrics to maintain sir
[11504.24 --> 11511.36]  next tall shirts when tall shirts when i don't know it's all in capitals i'm archiving it answer
[11511.36 --> 11517.20]  the question i don't i don't know we're we're please i want to prioritize okay so here's the problem
[11518.40 --> 11525.28]  here's the problem every color every size i just want one it's just yeah just i just want a black
[11525.28 --> 11529.92]  okay black shirt one shirt okay i'll tell you what would you guys be happy if we started with black

[11538.72 --> 11543.12]  there was shirts that were made for okay that uncomplicates it a little bit dan can you message
[11543.12 --> 11548.48]  nick and i genuinely don't think oh okay hold on i don't actually want to squeaky wheel this if it's
[11548.48 --> 11552.64]  going to cause issues no no the audience is squeaky wheeling it let's pause here for a second
[11552.64 --> 11560.40]  because we're cool with this but i pretty much guarantee you you'll release some shirt that
[11560.40 --> 11565.52]  people really like and it won't have a tall option and then people will go nuclear it might literally
[11565.52 --> 11570.88]  not be worth it that's okay we'll start with black okay yeah message nick let's get the let's get the
[11570.88 --> 11576.48]  grading done which is the what it's called when you do all the different sizes and uh we'll we'll start
[11576.48 --> 11581.84]  with something relatively that's not a bad idea if it's like very clear this is the only one we're doing
[11581.84 --> 11587.04]  right now because then you might be able to get a good idea of the distribution no not really you
[11587.04 --> 11592.48]  could uh you could write a small market segment on the chest you'll get some ideas yeah nick is already
[11592.48 --> 11600.32]  messaging me apparently all right hi nick i'm sorry nick uh maybe yeah i just got excited i'm so sorry nick
[11600.96 --> 11609.68]  uh what else is a shirt that fits me man i know uh sure this one is yeah there he is uh hey lads if
[11609.68 --> 11614.72]  dan's birthday were ever to coincide with the wan show would you consider swapping linus or luke's
[11614.72 --> 11620.08]  role during the show with dan curious to see what chaos that would bring i wonder who curated this
[11621.36 --> 11626.64]  i didn't curate it actually i did okay um i potentialed it no i left it in incoming because
[11626.64 --> 11634.72]  i wasn't sure i think the wan show is perfect the way it is i i i love dan and if you guys want to
[11634.72 --> 11640.16]  hang out with dan sometimes he's on the pre-show for pretty extended periods of time and we'll hang
[11640.16 --> 11644.80]  with luke and if you're on float plane then you can check that out over there and some of the past vods
[11645.36 --> 11647.44]  um oh sorry one sec
[11651.44 --> 11655.04]  this is important cool um
[11657.04 --> 11661.12]  but if anything if it was dan's birthday and i want to do something special for him i might tell
[11661.12 --> 11665.68]  him how about you don't have to do my show today maybe that would be more special but then he'd
[11665.68 --> 11670.24]  realize it was a trick and i was just trying to get him to be the one to end the streak so i don't
[11670.24 --> 11675.04]  i don't really know how it would all go down maybe dan should just address this i uh everything linus
[11675.04 --> 11679.92]  said but i want to work on my birthday so so you do or you don't i do yeah oh all right it's a good
[11679.92 --> 11687.20]  birthday present i get to hang out with you guys yeah birthday paycheck money hey dan happy birthday i got
[11687.20 --> 11694.56]  you money that's what i wanted yay i was extra late today so you got a bunch of overtime
[11697.44 --> 11700.80]  i haven't seen my family in months thanks i guess yeah thank you
[11703.68 --> 11711.92]  no it's it's it's fine yeah no it's fun uh let's see what else we got here um hey dan and the talent
[11711.92 --> 11718.16]  this order will take my lifetime over a thousand dollars hey thanks thanks whale do you have data
[11718.16 --> 11725.36]  i mean simon do you have data on which countries spend the most on merch any surprises any over
[11725.36 --> 11735.28]  represented demographics largest whale thanks almost certainly usa um i can check that though i think i
[11735.28 --> 11743.12]  don't really dig into the analytics on this too often but give me give me definitely usa yeah give
[11743.12 --> 11750.00]  me a seciboo here um luke do you want to do the next one while i see if i can figure this out i mean sure
[11750.72 --> 11750.96]  sure
[11753.68 --> 11761.52]  is there any yeah uh here this one uh i work at a semiconductor fab and our facilities brought a uh
[11761.52 --> 11769.12]  sorry they bought a lot of screwdrivers to give out as apparently they're clean room approved which is
[11769.68 --> 11776.08]  sick really that's surprising to me with the moving parts yeah exactly oh but the plastics because you
[11776.08 --> 11780.16]  could you can open it up and you can blow it down and stuff but it would be it would be more down to
[11780.16 --> 11787.52]  the materials that they wouldn't shed and no it shouldn't um cool that's super cool is there any interest
[11787.52 --> 11795.28]  in touring another fab uh it's not as great as intel though it is a semiconductor fab though yeah that
[11795.28 --> 11800.24]  might be cool because they have lots of different types of it depends we're always looking for something
[11800.24 --> 11805.44]  new that we can show to our audience you'd have to show stuff that you'd have to show us something bigger
[11805.44 --> 11811.36]  yeah and and bigger doesn't necessarily mean more expensive bigger could mean you know get us up close
[11811.36 --> 11816.88]  and personal yeah it would need to be something that isn't already freely out there yeah basically
[11817.52 --> 11823.68]  we have to bring something new but sick idea just good luck getting approval
[11826.00 --> 11833.92]  uh ll and d i recently replayed vanquish and binary domain which one do you prefer i've never heard of
[11833.92 --> 11839.76]  i don't know what either of these things are i also had never heard of them okay sorry i'm so sorry
[11839.76 --> 11847.44]  vanquish game thanks for all you do i think i remember the seddon twins being mentioned before
[11847.44 --> 11853.36]  and i wanted to know if any of you had any hockey stories favorites or hot takes besides super checks
[11854.08 --> 11860.48]  did you seriously just pronounce them seddin twins the sorry the the seddin twins
[11860.48 --> 11866.16]  it doesn't it doesn't have the umlau
[11871.60 --> 11881.28]  wow um answer the question any hockey stories uh no i just really wow love watching hockey i've never
[11881.28 --> 11889.04]  ever was good at it or really played it or anything um i was really into the sport back when um
[11891.04 --> 11894.64]  back when yvonne and i were like still living with her parents and stuff it wasn't until the lockout
[11894.64 --> 11899.20]  around that time that i kind of went okay yeah forget it i i'm kind of tired of cheering for
[11899.20 --> 11906.32]  corporation a versus corporation b it just doesn't really make sense to me anymore um and to be clear i that
[11906.32 --> 11910.16]  doesn't mean that i'm that i don't get why people watch sports there's a thousand reasons to watch
[11910.16 --> 11915.92]  sports just the the humanness of it uh the storylines the the people honestly is the biggest
[11915.92 --> 11921.68]  conversation yeah the conversation so just cultural participation just the love of the game i mean man
[11921.68 --> 11927.44]  i it's mesmerizing to me it drives yvonne crazy if i'm if i'm at a if i'm at a restaurant like even
[11927.44 --> 11933.28]  though i don't follow it anymore i mean i know the canucks are having a great season i know you know
[11933.28 --> 11937.04]  who the major players are on the team like i follow it peripherally still and if the game's on
[11937.04 --> 11942.96]  i'm like glued to it but i just i i just don't really have like time anymore and that combined
[11942.96 --> 11948.08]  with you know my feelings about you know the lockout and i there are things that i find uncomfortable
[11948.08 --> 11952.08]  about professional sports in general the way that the athletes are sort of treated like livestock
[11953.68 --> 11958.32]  on the one hand yeah sure they're compensated well but on the other hand sometimes they're not
[11958.32 --> 11964.80]  um you know college sports um there's some some college sports they're treated well now
[11965.68 --> 11972.08]  is that true they weren't historically yes some of them okay um yeah not for a long time it was like
[11972.72 --> 11978.40]  completely banned for them to make any money like basically at all from anything they couldn't take
[11978.40 --> 11986.80]  any sponsors they couldn't do yeah it was it was pretty intense um and now that's not a thing i think
[11986.80 --> 11990.64]  for football players i don't i don't know i don't know a lot about it i just know some things have
[11990.64 --> 11998.32]  changed i have a bunch of great hockey stories i played pretty high level i played provincial level
[11998.32 --> 12005.92]  like we i played on bc's team for ball hockey for a few years um and i have fun stories my two
[12005.92 --> 12013.20]  favorite ones they're both pretty short uh one my brother came back from playing football uh in the
[12013.20 --> 12018.72]  states for a university in the states and he came back and it was a like a hockey game that that
[12018.72 --> 12023.36]  happened like immediately when he came back so he's still in football mode and one of the kids
[12023.36 --> 12029.12]  crossed their feet right in front of them that was on the other team that's just like a i've talked
[12029.12 --> 12036.24]  to linus about this before that's like a you hit now indicator basically and rich just flattened up
[12036.24 --> 12041.20]  and then immediately got up didn't even wait for the ref just walked to the penalty box immediately
[12041.20 --> 12047.84]  it was just like yep like apparently like mid movement he was like oops and just knew he screwed
[12047.84 --> 12054.64]  up and was like yeah i uh i'm ejecting myself um which was funny uh another one my brother was reffing
[12054.64 --> 12061.76]  one of my games and the other team was kind of understandably unhappy about this but it was what it
[12061.76 --> 12066.64]  was there was only so many refs my brother and i both refed it was somewhat inevitable it would happen
[12066.64 --> 12074.80]  eventually in one direction or the other um and they were kind of chirping oh okay um they were
[12074.80 --> 12082.96]  complaining about it uh they were complaining about it for most of the game and then um i like hit
[12082.96 --> 12087.76]  someone someone was uh slashing my my shins a bunch and stuff and they're pissing me off then i hit them
[12087.76 --> 12092.64]  into the boards pretty hard and we were dogpiling a little bit and my brother ran up to the dog pile and
[12092.64 --> 12098.72]  he this was this was prime football player richard richard's a big very strong guy all the time but
[12098.72 --> 12104.88]  this was like omega richard and he walked up to me grabbed the back of my jersey and actually threw
[12104.88 --> 12113.44]  me like i caught air significantly through the uh floor of the the ball hockey arena i went flying it
[12113.44 --> 12119.84]  was like crazy and for the entire rest of the game the whole other team was like it's cool it's fine
[12119.84 --> 12123.28]  we don't mind that he's reffing this game seems like he'll be fair about things
[12125.36 --> 12131.60]  i was like yeah cool all right we're good um okay i'm working on this i can't get a revenue number
[12132.40 --> 12140.32]  um but i have sessions converted which i think is basically people reach checkout and buy something
[12140.32 --> 12146.48]  right so i can get an order number like how many orders so now i just need to put in a date range is
[12146.48 --> 12151.44]  there like a lifetime they don't let you do that because that would be really hard on the servers
[12151.44 --> 12158.64]  i guess but i'm just going to put in 2018 to present oh crap i clicked the wrong thing um
[12160.00 --> 12165.28]  i can already tell you guys that it's going to be yeah a converted is a converted session
[12165.28 --> 12170.00]  to be clear is not just someone who like adds something to a cart or shows significant interest
[12170.00 --> 12174.32]  but it's someone who adds something to their cart proceeds to check out and actually does purchase the
[12174.32 --> 12180.32]  items yeah this is going to take a minute i just asked for five years of shopify data
[12181.44 --> 12185.52]  which for our store is a non-trivial amount of transactions where they email it to you
[12186.72 --> 12191.76]  no this is that one no no it'll it'll do a thing okay yeah give it a sec it's just it's it's a working
[12191.76 --> 12205.36]  on it okay all right uh united states is at about eight times canada which is about double the uk
[12206.24 --> 12210.96]  which is a little higher than germany which is a little higher than australia which is about
[12210.96 --> 12216.40]  double the netherlands which is about double norway which is about the same as sweden which is about the
[12216.40 --> 12221.60]  same as switzerland which is a little more than denmark which is about the same as austria which
[12221.60 --> 12226.72]  is about the same as france which is a little more than belgium which is about the same as new zealand
[12226.72 --> 12231.84]  and a little more than israel and then it kind of goes on from there and you know kind of trickles off
[12231.84 --> 12241.60]  so yeah the united states is um over half of our sales which i don't think would be a big surprise to
[12241.60 --> 12248.96]  anyone united states is 40 of our viewership so yeah um and then you know the proximity right and
[12248.96 --> 12253.60]  the the shipping challenges with shipping overseas it makes sense that they'd be overrepresented for
[12253.60 --> 12256.88]  for customers that actually purchase something from us compared to just watch the videos
[12258.56 --> 12264.88]  i'm not shocked australia is so high um vickis uh australia they've they've like always been our bros i
[12264.88 --> 12270.64]  think it's ever since we moved wan show or did we move wan show because we knew we had australian viewers i
[12270.64 --> 12275.68]  can't remember which came first but there's a there's a huge tag community in australia considering
[12275.68 --> 12283.20]  how few people live there and how few of them have internet apparently i i can't i can't i mean your
[12283.20 --> 12295.28]  internet is it's but like i shouldn't tease i shouldn't tease that's it not like oh you wanted the
[12295.28 --> 12303.20]  largest whale though uh hold on i don't know if i can find that um oh this might be easier than i thought
[12307.68 --> 12317.04]  add filter orders placed products purchased amount spent hello okay is greater than
[12317.04 --> 12325.36]  oh i can put a value uh what value should i put i have no idea i mean someone's probably bought a
[12325.36 --> 12329.52]  batch of stuff for their like company would that have been through shopify or would that have been
[12329.52 --> 12339.92]  through contacting i don't know dude do you like holy okay so i put in over 2000 and
[12339.92 --> 12347.44]  i found buddy who's spent almost nine grand i was gonna say you should put it nine grand actually i
[12347.44 --> 12350.88]  wonder if there's anyone over oh anyone over 9 000 yeah
[12354.24 --> 12360.48]  yes yeah yeah there's um there's i'm assuming these are because i i've talked to people that are like oh
[12360.48 --> 12367.92]  yeah i like outfitted my whole shop of like many workers with screwdrivers or um my my company has a lot
[12367.92 --> 12371.12]  of people like going out on the road and doing things so i got everyone backpacks or whatever
[12371.12 --> 12376.56]  else so i think there's a lot of like corporate level purchases that have gone through um
[12379.20 --> 12387.60]  yeah there's there's a handful of people around the about 10 grand range that's very surprising to me
[12387.60 --> 12393.12]  but um i mean not crazy just because the corporate purchases that i've heard about that's it i think
[12393.12 --> 12398.64]  buying all for yourself that doesn't really make any sense but yeah if you gift a lot or if you're
[12398.64 --> 12405.76]  buying things for work i mean i've seen spikes in um in screwdrivers where like just one person buys
[12405.76 --> 12411.44]  a hundred in a day so it's like that's that's gonna add a freaking lot of money right um that's you know
[12411.44 --> 12419.20]  six grand seven grand on one purchase uh oh nick just sent me an image he goes i'm pretty sure the top
[12419.20 --> 12427.60]  person is reselling oh yeah there is some of that yeah that makes sense someone linked me to
[12427.60 --> 12432.40]  a yeah like scalper of i think it was stubby screwdrivers well it might not necessarily be
[12432.40 --> 12437.04]  scalping as much as it is reselling into regions where yes the first party option might not be
[12437.04 --> 12443.20]  available by a sign oh because we don't to my knowledge do much in the way of volume discounts to
[12443.20 --> 12448.72]  anyone so they're they're not and like the products are just available from our store the shipping scale
[12448.72 --> 12454.56]  uh they would they would get a deal on shipping i guess so if they lived somewhere where their
[12454.56 --> 12459.36]  shipping rates are way more reasonable to send out then maybe they could take advantage of that
[12459.36 --> 12464.40]  compared to our own pricing but yeah i saw a link i don't know if it was like or not a link i saw a
[12464.40 --> 12468.48]  picture which is why i'm gonna say this part i don't know if it's like shopped or edited or not or
[12468.48 --> 12476.24]  whatever yeah um but it was a stubby that was selling for well over 200 that i saw that sales i think
[12476.24 --> 12483.76]  yeah i saw that i don't know i'm sure i guess no idea you know what i have an idea of that it's time
[12483.76 --> 12487.60]  to end the show we didn't make it we'll see you again next week i didn't want to make it i didn't
[12487.60 --> 12492.48]  want to get over midnight see you again next week same bad time same bad channel thanks for tuning in
