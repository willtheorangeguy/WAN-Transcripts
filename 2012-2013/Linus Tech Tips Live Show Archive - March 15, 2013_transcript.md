[0.00 --> 7.80]  Welcome to the live stream guys we've got a ton of cool topics tonight including
[7.80 --> 14.04]  I don't know what are our topics tonight I have a thing with topics but I don't remember
[14.04 --> 20.28]  we've got some blackberry juice we've got we've got one of the most incendiary things I think I've
[20.28 --> 24.40]  ever heard which is apparently some game developers are running around saying the
[24.40 --> 29.34]  PlayStation 4 will outperform PCs for years to come which is he doesn't understand anything
[29.34 --> 35.40]  about performance or hardware anything at all about anything although although it's funny
[35.40 --> 40.32]  because this was what gonna be one of our featured news items from the Linus Tech Tips forum and I
[40.32 --> 46.20]  have to like the guy who who posted this one I give him props for posting in our news section
[46.20 --> 51.78]  because that's great and that is appreciated but he was a little bit sensationalist about his headline
[51.78 --> 59.12]  so I will will clarify that once we once we move into that so why don't we start with something a
[59.12 --> 65.84]  little bit actually we've got a lot of crazy stuff to talk about we're gonna talk about your Windows
[65.84 --> 72.62]  8 downgrade we're gonna talk about how I'm actually not gonna be moving to Windows 8 on my personal rig
[72.62 --> 81.50]  I hope that Twitter managed to where the heck is the where's the I got it I got it I got it it's always
[81.50 --> 87.32]  behind yes just always assume that it's fine nope I refuse to do that that is clearly incorrect and
[87.32 --> 92.22]  a bad thing that I will not be doing at all it's always behind you oh did I leave the twitch stream on
[92.22 --> 99.92]  they came from behind yes oh yeah we'll be talking Starcraft heart of the swarm because we have an actual
[99.92 --> 105.14]  gamer on the show this week him they fit that in there by the way in the campaign there's a
[105.14 --> 112.02]  I was so stoked oh I love that so stoked when I heard it they also fit a Wilhelm scream into the
[112.02 --> 119.36]  trailer oh no yeah a marine gets stepped on or I can't I can't do the Wilhelm scream hold on
[119.36 --> 125.54]  ah no it's like impossible to recreate yeah it's it's awesome though if you don't know what Wilhelm scream
[125.54 --> 131.84]  is YouTube it yeah YouTube it not now because it's in like every movie ever yeah especially Star Wars
[131.84 --> 137.00]  yeah anything to do with LucasArts every Star Wars every Luke every Indiana Jones every Star Wars video
[137.00 --> 144.14]  video movie movie we make videos George Lucas makes movies or at least he did in the 70s and 80s
[144.14 --> 153.52]  and you could argue some he made some later those are videos oh that's okay I'm not going to get into
[153.52 --> 158.60]  original trilogy versus new trilogy that would be an interesting live topic we're going to talk
[158.60 --> 165.20]  batteries we're going to talk about oh okay so this is this okay here let's kick it off so the we've only
[165.20 --> 169.30]  got 200 and oh okay the viewers are going up a little bit I'm just a little bit confused because I
[169.30 --> 175.14]  I'm never quite sure if the live stream starting now think do you have to actually specifically
[175.14 --> 182.16]  announce on Twitch that you're streaming because I think there's like an announce button but I don't
[182.16 --> 186.80]  know how exactly that works you know what I'm not going to worry about it too much I have no idea
[186.80 --> 192.80]  a few people said nope or not really not really okay I gotta get on this stream jet so let's uh let's
[192.80 --> 199.26]  get started with the Belkin Linksys acquisition is pretty much done so I got an email from my Linksys
[199.26 --> 207.26]  contact today saying that his email is changing from his name at cisco.com to his name at I think
[207.26 --> 212.78]  I think it's going to be a Linksys email now so Belkin has come out and said okay we're keeping
[212.78 --> 219.10]  the two different uh streams of products separate so product development is still going to be separate
[219.10 --> 225.26]  um product uh branding is still going to be separate okay so when Cisco did the Linksys acquisition
[225.26 --> 230.50]  in fact if I could find a Cisco I see I called it a Cisco router if I could find a Linksys router
[230.50 --> 234.60]  lying around here somewhere I'd be able to show you they actually say Cisco right on the top yeah in
[234.60 --> 243.82]  fact that's what happened when Linksys asked us to change because we originally oh yeah had our CES
[243.82 --> 250.70]  content branded Cisco because we couldn't find the Linksys brand in use anywhere they probably already
[250.70 --> 255.80]  knew that it was coming soon so they were like uh yeah we saw your first video and we'd actually
[255.80 --> 263.20]  uh we'd really like you to change that to uh Linksys brand and stuff
[263.20 --> 269.18]  good call taking that out was someone complaining about it uh might have been audible no I heard it
[269.18 --> 273.38]  anyway so uh so yeah that's probably what happened there so anyway they're going to keep them separate
[273.38 --> 280.30]  and it's going to be pretty much business as usual for Linksys as a separate though I think so too
[280.30 --> 285.44]  because there's nothing wrong with the product no no like we actually we did some really interesting
[285.44 --> 292.98]  testing with the EA was it the 42 or the 45 45 versus the with the EA was it the 42 or the 45 45
[292.98 --> 300.50]  versus the n900 now versus the n900 from WD and we found that without any optimization or tweaking of the
[300.50 --> 306.28]  QoS at all it was just such a beast for very heavy network loads insane like we did we did crazier
[306.28 --> 312.28]  stuff that we do on that network like ever that was probably the hardest load we ever put on it
[312.28 --> 320.34]  multiple Netflix streams uh Skype call a game stream um and torrenting and torrenting yeah and we had
[320.34 --> 324.76]  like six or seven computers going so it was like crazy and it was like a lot of torrents because we
[324.76 --> 329.62]  were pushing back and forth from school yeah so even things like the website are going to stay the same
[329.62 --> 335.70]  so you're not going to actually know I mean I don't think someone like Belkin acquiring a very
[335.70 --> 341.08]  strong networking brand like Linksys really wants to mess with it too much whereas with Cisco where
[341.08 --> 345.78]  they have that more premium branding I can understand why they'd want some trickle down effect
[345.78 --> 350.34]  and it's like oh so it should be worth more of a premium because we're we're Cisco and honestly
[350.34 --> 357.44]  like to most consumers they will probably have no idea that the sale and acquisition ever occurred
[357.44 --> 363.36]  and that's probably a good thing yeah if they just nope nobody knows and that's exactly what we want
[363.36 --> 370.38]  yeah absolutely I think not many people are watching yet so uh hopefully this has blasted on Twitter or
[370.38 --> 375.48]  yeah there it is uh live stream starting now I see it so hopefully people uh tune in pretty quickly here
[375.48 --> 381.74]  because otherwise it's just us and our 400 most loyal viewers whatever man thank you guys for
[381.74 --> 386.68]  apparently planning your lives around being here to watch us live on our Friday night when we could
[386.68 --> 393.10]  otherwise be dating attractive women or eating bacon or eating yeah slick I actually haven't even had
[393.10 --> 401.12]  one BLT sandwich and it's not even going to be hot by the time I eat it it's already not yeah oh even mine
[401.12 --> 409.06]  was like room temperature so so disappoint all right so I don't remember what hotkeys we use for um
[409.06 --> 417.82]  for switching scenes anymore is it like shift is it f keys oh yeah there we go yay twitter okay so it's
[417.82 --> 424.30]  2 a.m in Argentina thank you for tuning in can you do live stream at a sensible time for us British
[424.30 --> 429.70]  European types we will change it eventually yeah the plan is to change the plan is to change it
[429.70 --> 436.30]  probably time and probably day uh yeah probably day I don't want to do it on Friday nights I don't
[436.30 --> 440.70]  think most people want to do it on Friday nights because most people like even if you're not going
[440.70 --> 447.46]  out you're probably wanting to game with your buds so like I want to game with my buds I'm pretty sure
[447.46 --> 450.44]  they want to game with their yeah I'm pretty sure they want to game with their buds too someone's
[450.44 --> 457.06]  asking uh where happened to the Acer laptop oh it's still here slicks on my old MSI um like sort of
[457.06 --> 462.22]  gaming ready model that I try not to use because man is heavy but it's kind of awesome because it's
[462.22 --> 468.58]  like quad core and stuff but uh there we go let's go ahead and go back to our can you please do a video
[468.58 --> 475.06]  on the HIS 7970 gigahertz edition 3 gig what do you think of this GPU I think it's a 7970 gigahertz
[475.06 --> 481.56]  edition and I think it has three gigs of RAM and I think HIS put their sticker on it that's what I think
[481.56 --> 487.16]  bam does it worry you that google has control over your job with AdSense have you thought of
[487.16 --> 491.90]  setting a paid subscription for your site there is no way we are implementing any kind of paid
[491.90 --> 497.80]  subscription for our content bye bye every single viewer we have yeah I mean we love you guys and
[497.80 --> 505.56]  we know that you love us too but we're pretty sure that we're all like nope premium content five dollar
[505.56 --> 510.64]  monthly subscription you guys are going to be like yeah I'll just go watch someone else's unboxing video so
[510.64 --> 516.48]  um I mean we think we make good content and all that good stuff but for us I mean our value add
[516.48 --> 524.06]  that will allow us to no longer give google complete control over our livelihoods is our audience and if
[524.06 --> 531.54]  we alienate the audience then like we suck and on that note a word from our sponsor intel for the
[531.54 --> 535.36]  live stream what a great segue see I'm getting good at this right I don't like
[540.64 --> 550.56]  okay we're gonna figure out how to play back the sponsor thing in a moment here I'm not quite sure
[550.56 --> 555.58]  what happened there uh it used to just play automatically okay give us a moment to give
[555.58 --> 557.02]  you a word from our sponsors
[570.64 --> 582.00]  this video is brought to you by our trusted partner intel for a limited time only with the
[582.00 --> 587.84]  purchase of any unlocked core i5 or core i7 intel cpu get a free intel beanie with a chance to win an
[587.84 --> 593.28]  intel snowboard valid for canadian and u.s customers only some restrictions apply for complete details
[593.28 --> 601.60]  visit intel gaming promo dot com so the great news guys is that it's mid-march which means we're only
[601.60 --> 607.28]  going to have the intel snowboard promo running for about another two weeks um and i know some of you
[607.28 --> 613.12]  might not want to see it anymore hey we have another sponsor so speaking of sponsors and not relying on
[613.12 --> 618.32]  google forever that's a big part of the reason why we did two things so number one is we're reaching out
[618.32 --> 624.72]  and getting sponsors like sponsors that we trust that we actually use so if you go you know linus
[624.72 --> 631.44]  what cpu are you using in your computer i'm using an intel cpu like at the same time and i've been
[631.44 --> 637.12]  using it for years not because intel sponsoring tech tips at the same time we're not hitting on amd
[637.12 --> 643.20]  and at the same time we're not hitting on amd in fact amd particularly on the gpu side has been getting a
[643.20 --> 649.52]  lot of love lately from us check out the what's the most recent one we did uh battlefield 3.
[649.52 --> 655.44]  okay battlefield 3 yeah they won battlefield 3. i think they've won every single gpu showdown so
[655.44 --> 660.56]  far i think they won all of them and then like tied one or something yeah i think uh battlefield 3 was
[660.56 --> 666.80]  more more of a tie and then crisis 3 steamrolled but still the top two spots in battlefield 3 if
[666.80 --> 670.96]  you look at the overall chart that's true which is poked in at the end by a little bit because there
[670.96 --> 675.60]  isn't really a good vocal segue for me to overlay the overall chart but it is there so if you guys
[675.60 --> 680.24]  are watching the battlefield 3 video go somewhere near the end and it just kind of goes hello and
[680.24 --> 685.04]  then leaves after a little while but check it out that's like the whole like all the cards on one
[685.04 --> 689.92]  big chart you can see the top two spots are actually md cards there you go um although we have a new
[689.92 --> 695.92]  sponsor so cooler master particularly cm storm gaming peripherals which i think both you and i have been
[695.92 --> 701.92]  pretty raw raw raw about same factory as filco like you can't really that's all you really need
[701.92 --> 708.80]  to know you can't even go that wrong i've got a quickfire tk upstairs that i use like whenever
[710.00 --> 715.12]  whenever your ducky was dead whenever my ducky was dead yeah or when i was swapping the keycaps out of
[715.12 --> 720.00]  my ducky or like i bring it home if i go to my parents house for weekends it's easier to travel with
[720.00 --> 725.76]  like it's yeah it's nice and like it's pretty rugged too so cooler master's on board now which
[725.76 --> 731.76]  we're really excited about and in addition to that we also just signed with twitch.tv as a youtube network
[731.76 --> 737.68]  so we won't have to rely on google's ad sales anymore so twitch is actually going to be responsible
[737.68 --> 743.68]  for filling our videos but like the regular youtube pre-rolls with hopefully more relevant ads which i think
[743.68 --> 751.28]  is important yeah um as well as hopefully you know not making us rely strictly on google which i mean
[751.28 --> 756.32]  even now we rely on google in huge ways just for the infrastructure yeah uh delivering the videos to
[756.32 --> 761.20]  you guys they make all kinds of mistakes that honestly cost us a lot of money and a lot of headache
[761.76 --> 768.72]  uh not not delivering our videos to our subscribers yeah subscription box i have um my personal youtube
[768.72 --> 776.48]  account gets like less than a quarter of the linys tech tips uploads i'm like what i should be getting
[776.48 --> 782.64]  all of these very frustrating i mean there's that there's the fact that uh youtube screws up on things
[782.64 --> 789.20]  like we had a video set to private and it went public so we we accidentally broke embargo on the gtx titan
[789.20 --> 794.96]  launch which was not cool and they've had i mean that's been broken for months at a time in the past
[794.96 --> 800.88]  to the point where it's just kind of ridiculous so uh so yeah we still rely on them in a big way but
[800.88 --> 806.40]  we're not going to rely on them for our livelihoods which is sort of exciting well not entirely for our
[806.40 --> 811.92]  livelihoods we'll still rely on them yeah if anyone from google's watching we'd still love you please
[811.92 --> 822.48]  don't shut off our channel don't close our channel yes we like our channel um okay so let's talk galaxy s4
[822.48 --> 826.00]  actually you know what no let's go to let's go to twitter for for a little bit of q a here
[826.80 --> 831.60]  let's see what you guys have to say about the show so far i'm just gonna go ahead sorry if people
[831.60 --> 836.72]  notice that i'm looking down a lot i'm trying to get on twitch but i can't log into my account so
[836.72 --> 841.20]  oh i'm on twitch over here yeah but i want to be able to monitor it here yeah okay we should just be
[841.20 --> 845.20]  monitoring it we should be monitoring the chat at all times because you guys notice when anything's
[845.20 --> 849.68]  wrong right away which is good uh johnny blaze says you should try the new blackberry z10 when you're
[849.68 --> 854.72]  done with the htc1 i would love to if anyone from blackberry is watching we'd love to hear from you
[854.72 --> 860.56]  we'd love to have an opportunity to try it out i mean it's funny because we've said that enough times
[860.56 --> 865.68]  like kind of joking but then there was that guy from bell who watched and we called them we said that
[865.68 --> 870.56]  their customer support with butt heads so he called us and fixed it like fixed everything everything's
[870.56 --> 878.00]  perfect now and then um we called out raul sood yeah formerly a voodoo who apparently left a comment
[878.00 --> 883.60]  on our video um because we said that uh we weren't sure if any of the solid gold cases is sold yes and
[883.60 --> 890.80]  he was like yes we sold at least one fifty thousand dollars for that gold case which is just unbelievable
[890.80 --> 897.68]  um and you know what's what uh i checked it is him i had josh follow up with him and find out if it was
[897.68 --> 902.00]  actually him and it actually was raul if you're wondering where that comment came from on youtube
[902.00 --> 906.64]  you can just set whatever name you want yeah so we've had like barack obama comment on our videos
[906.64 --> 912.64]  i'm like i'm pretty sure pretty sure it's not bro i'm pretty sure barry has uh some other videos to
[912.64 --> 918.40]  watch that are not related to technology and whatnot pretty sure if he wanted a really good computer he
[918.40 --> 923.12]  would just kind of have a really good computer do you think the 7970 is better for battlefield 3 call
[923.12 --> 927.92]  of duty and tomb raider you know what we have to do tomb raider yeah i want to wait i want to wait
[927.92 --> 932.96]  till driver optimization i don't want to do too many beta drivers anymore because all the weird stuff
[932.96 --> 937.68]  maybe in a couple weeks so what we're going to do is we're going to wait till amd and nvidia
[938.48 --> 944.88]  both drop pretty good driver optimization revisions okay then i'll run all the test test benches for
[944.88 --> 950.72]  that bench benchmarks not test benches yeah um we're all running on all the test benches every test
[950.72 --> 954.56]  bench we have uh i'll run all the benchmarks for that and then we'll release a video on that right
[954.56 --> 960.24]  away and then you'll have your bf3 and tomb raider did he mention another game uh battlefield 3 cod and
[960.24 --> 965.92]  tomb raider so i mean cod runs on like an atari so i wouldn't worry about it man yeah fine yeah it's
[965.92 --> 971.76]  probably okay just don't stress don't stress jason it's cool all right speaking of which someone asked
[971.76 --> 976.56]  for a shout out to jason but a different jason slick could you tell us about your personal rig maybe we'll
[976.56 --> 981.60]  cover that when we talk about your windows 8 downgrade someone asked is razer really that bad
[981.60 --> 985.04]  because from what i hear in the internet it's the worst branding in the world no i don't think that's
[985.04 --> 992.64]  true at all i mean like any company not every product is perfect but i mean the um orb weaver
[992.64 --> 998.96]  is by far the best game pad that we've ever encountered uh what was the name of that uh that
[998.96 --> 1005.92]  controller the saber tube right when we saw at ces it's not tournament ready or is it tournament ready
[1005.92 --> 1010.64]  the other one's not tournament ready oh that i don't remember it's either the previous razer
[1013.28 --> 1018.64]  i think it's no orca's a headset i know the one you're onza onza yeah um it's i can't remember if
[1018.64 --> 1023.76]  it's the onza or the new saber tooth well the new one has those buttons on the bottom they're
[1023.76 --> 1029.52]  removable or they're not oh no and they're not macro ready right so the new one is tournament ready one
[1029.52 --> 1034.48]  yeah right because you can't rebind all the buttons all over the place yeah so i mean and the build
[1034.48 --> 1040.00]  quality of it was outstanding especially compared to the to the older one which wasn't as good i mean
[1040.00 --> 1047.12]  that black widow ultimate is a very solid mechanical keyboard i mean guys i guess oh yeah and the blade
[1048.24 --> 1052.56]  the blade is probably right up there with guys like apple in terms of the build quality of that notebook
[1053.28 --> 1063.20]  all i'm gonna say i've owned two razer lycosas or lachesis neither of them work okay so i think it's a
[1063.20 --> 1067.76]  mixed bag when you have people that have a bad experience then they're much more likely to talk
[1067.76 --> 1074.64]  about that than a good experience that's also very true and talking from my ncix experience where i
[1074.64 --> 1081.12]  know what the sales numbers look like i can tell you right now if you see five complaints about razer
[1081.12 --> 1085.36]  compared to some other gaming brand it might have something to do with the fact that they're selling
[1086.00 --> 1093.44]  five times more than them or more right so that's definitely a very valid and very large point i mean
[1093.44 --> 1097.92]  it was like that with ocz and ssds for the longest time where people are like all the complaints i see
[1097.92 --> 1103.04]  about ssds are ocz well yeah all the ssds that are selling are ocz so what do you want me to say
[1103.60 --> 1109.84]  like yeah whatever man uh okay so let's go back i'm working on a prodigy built what does your wife
[1109.84 --> 1114.16]  think about you using the living room as a workshop for your personal rig i actually am not anymore my personal
[1114.16 --> 1120.88]  rig is almost done i'm working on a prodigy build i thought you finished well i still have to my uh
[1120.88 --> 1126.32]  the power adapter i made myself i made a left angle power adapter for my optical drive but i used wires
[1126.32 --> 1131.12]  that were too thin and they didn't bite into the thing enough so i have to replace that i have to fix
[1131.12 --> 1136.08]  the extension wire i was using for my four fans on the bottom because it like broke or something
[1136.64 --> 1143.68]  decrepit somehow i have to remount the top led strip because the included adhesive with the phobias is not
[1143.68 --> 1147.36]  holding it in place so i'm going to use my double-sided velcro yeah and then i have to figure
[1147.36 --> 1153.12]  out how to bleed that bloody t-virus so it was pretty close was it not it's getting there but i'm
[1153.12 --> 1156.96]  thinking if i stick like something in there and just kind of swirl it around that might help you can
[1156.96 --> 1161.28]  do that then you gotta take those caps off and that's not always the easiest no no it's easy with the fill
[1161.28 --> 1166.40]  port yeah you can just stick it through the fill port i think it should be okay you get tied up in the uh
[1167.60 --> 1171.36]  maybe in the helix i don't know i haven't tried yet either way if you want to do shake
[1171.36 --> 1175.60]  this is like totally has nothing to do with this i don't want to shake the computer but if you want
[1175.60 --> 1180.88]  to do shake we can lift it up and i can stabilize it you can shake oh oh i shudder to think because
[1180.88 --> 1185.12]  there's enough things that just are broken enough about it um we're not going to talk about bit torrent
[1185.12 --> 1189.68]  on the show we like to keep things clean but feel free to talk about bit torrent somewhere else
[1190.24 --> 1195.84]  uh thoughts on elric joining the new egg crew i think it's i think it's a huge benefit for the new
[1195.84 --> 1202.40]  egg tv guys i mean he brings with him an enormous audience yeah he's got his crew basically like
[1202.40 --> 1206.48]  he's got all the guys that are going to follow him which is he's been around forever i mean you
[1206.48 --> 1212.16]  look at how quickly tech of tomorrow grew when he departed from motherboards org and channel pro
[1212.72 --> 1217.60]  it's going to be interesting departing from motherboards.org channel pro yeah going to check
[1217.60 --> 1222.80]  of tomorrow which he was already kind of he was already kind of running on his own but like boosting it up and then
[1222.80 --> 1228.56]  ditch boost up he may i don't know what his plan is i haven't talked to him he may maintain it but
[1228.56 --> 1234.80]  because i know kyle and paul at least have their own channels yes they do awesome sauce news and paul's
[1234.80 --> 1239.76]  hardware if you guys want to check them out paul did a really good video review of the leonidas 30 inch
[1239.76 --> 1247.12]  ips uh monitor that's available for like 600 700 bucks on ebay yeah um so guys check out his video of
[1247.12 --> 1251.28]  that if you're looking at a large format display which it happens i am because mine's broken now
[1253.52 --> 1258.00]  if you want the story on that because he probably doesn't want to reiterate it personal build
[1258.00 --> 1263.04]  personal rig update 15. it's pretty much the most depressing video i think either of us have ever
[1263.04 --> 1271.68]  filmed yeah yeah oh spring break is it spring break yes it's been so long since i've been in school i
[1271.68 --> 1277.28]  don't even think about it anymore maybe that's why no one's watching linus please enable 240p viewing option
[1277.28 --> 1283.92]  i have no idea how to enable or disable different viewing options i think that's handled by twitch
[1283.92 --> 1288.24]  we stream at 1080p but i believe you can downscale it to whatever you want yeah i have no idea how to do
[1288.24 --> 1297.92]  that yeah no idea um all right so let's move into our next discussion topic should we just let's just
[1297.92 --> 1303.92]  let's just hit the galaxy s4 now shall we boom so we cheated a little bit in our teaser video for the
[1303.92 --> 1310.96]  live stream where we said we had a galaxy s4 but actually we don't this is just a galaxy s3 which
[1310.96 --> 1316.16]  should give you guys some idea of how different we think the s4 is from the s3 if you look at the front
[1316.16 --> 1324.64]  of the s4 the camera and these two little leds go slightly more vertical and this little indicator led
[1324.64 --> 1331.52]  is now visible just like these ones no go slow hold on slow down slow down you're blowing my mind man
[1331.52 --> 1336.16]  it's visible you can see it's got the black ring just like the other ones it goes slightly more
[1336.16 --> 1343.44]  vertical and it comes all the way over here to go right beside the speaker no way hold on beside the
[1343.44 --> 1348.00]  speaker fan freaking task game changer i don't even know who could have possibly thought about that
[1348.00 --> 1356.88]  the button is like slightly more squared off hold on there's a button one button one button you can't
[1356.88 --> 1361.68]  put more than one button okay although with that said the htc one does not have a button i don't know
[1361.68 --> 1368.08]  if you noticed that i did there is no middle button there's an htc left i'm not sure what to think
[1368.08 --> 1374.16]  because you know you double tap home to get to your recent apps which is fine which is fine i'm okay
[1374.16 --> 1379.60]  with a double tap it's fast and the haptic feedback on this thing is outstanding okay let's stay focused
[1379.60 --> 1386.56]  on s4 focused on s4 okay okay physical changes carry on the back take it off and show what the inside
[1386.56 --> 1394.88]  difference is okay okay here i'll hold this one so back from here all the way up to there is pretty much
[1394.88 --> 1405.52]  the same okay and then the flashlight goes down under the camera and this disappears okay and that is
[1405.52 --> 1410.72]  innovation and it's do you have the specs up on your computer i can get it up yeah get the full
[1410.72 --> 1416.16]  specs up because i'm gonna start i'm gonna talk about sort of the the philosophy behind what might
[1416.16 --> 1424.80]  have driven samsung to go with a a very similar to galaxy s3 design so no matter how much i rag on
[1424.80 --> 1429.20]  it does kind of make sense yeah it kind of makes sense okay because when you looked at galaxy one
[1429.20 --> 1438.32]  honestly it wasn't a great phone no my wife has one it has not really served her well no i'm not
[1438.32 --> 1443.20]  going to rag on them or anything but they knew it wasn't great galaxy s2 came out pretty quickly
[1443.20 --> 1452.40]  and revamped everything it went amo led it went uh way faster way faster it had a way better screen it
[1452.40 --> 1457.92]  was just better in every possible way and they completely reinvented it with the galaxy s2 then
[1457.92 --> 1462.96]  galaxy s3 came along and went okay we're going to turn every take everything that was good about the s2
[1462.96 --> 1467.92]  and keep it we're going to go with a shape that's much nicer to hold did the screen get bigger i don't
[1467.92 --> 1473.68]  remember i think so i think it did i can't i can't remember galaxy s2 again though pretty sure it did
[1473.68 --> 1479.36]  didn't last that long and was replaced by a phone that was significantly better in every possible way
[1479.36 --> 1487.04]  and replaced it now galaxy s3 hung around with us for a long time i mean this launched we did a video
[1487.04 --> 1495.36]  back around around launch so that's going to give me some idea of when it was but ncix com galaxy
[1496.40 --> 1502.72]  someone's probably already uh oh galaxy video card eight months ago so so this launched almost a year
[1502.72 --> 1509.92]  ago like nine ten months ago and here we are finally samsung's replacing it with the s4 which is
[1512.24 --> 1518.40]  similar but remember this time they're not replacing a phone that was fundamentally flawed in any way
[1518.40 --> 1525.20]  they're replacing a phone that was i did really well the number one selling smartphone yeah if you're
[1525.20 --> 1533.44]  samsung do you reinvent the wheel when the wheel's spinning really good one thing i brought up when
[1533.44 --> 1541.92]  we were well not good yeah go ahead um um sorry that was funny uh we were in the car talking about it
[1541.92 --> 1547.60]  and i was like okay well if it's really similar form factor and just like awesome sauce specs compared
[1547.60 --> 1554.80]  to before why don't they take the apple approach and just call it like not an s because it's already
[1554.80 --> 1564.08]  s because samsung but like the samsung gs x right gs3x or something like add another thing to the end
[1564.08 --> 1568.56]  because they're not changing not really really changing the form factor of the phone not changing
[1568.56 --> 1574.48]  stuff like that and then you i mean that's something apple's gets away with though because they've been
[1574.48 --> 1582.08]  doing it for so long yeah i mean you know what an s means an s means an evolutionary change um i mean
[1582.08 --> 1587.12]  they've done this with ipad as well where they don't even rebrand the damn thing anymore no they just go
[1587.76 --> 1593.76]  ipad ipad with retina display so you when you buy an ipad you're buying an ipad unless it's an ipad 2 so
[1593.76 --> 1600.24]  there was ipad ipad 2 and ipad yeah with retina and i i mean maybe something like that would have been
[1600.24 --> 1605.76]  appropriate here as a galaxy s3 uber edition or like whatever the brand likes better branding than
[1605.76 --> 1611.92]  that but then branding consolidation is a really really big deal and that brings this into play
[1611.92 --> 1616.64]  okay let's talk about that later hold on i want to talk specs on this first okay okay so samsung's
[1616.64 --> 1623.84]  either going to have um a what is it snapdragon s600 is it called s600 something something snapdragon 600
[1623.84 --> 1630.24]  something or other um so that's going to be a 1.9 gigahertz quad core which is pretty similar to the
[1630.24 --> 1637.84]  1.7 gigahertz uh uh snapdragon 600 that's in the htc1 a little bit faster although it has a beefier
[1637.84 --> 1643.76]  battery 2600 milliamp hours compared to 2300 or 2350 or something like that um but there's going to be
[1643.76 --> 1649.60]  another version that's an octocore axianus or whatever they call their thing uh that's an octocore
[1649.60 --> 1656.32]  that has four a7 cores and four a15 cores now i would go as far as to say if their intention is to
[1656.32 --> 1662.00]  use those four cores either for power saving or performance it's still kind of a quad core can
[1662.00 --> 1667.68]  nvidia get away with calling tegra 3 a five core because they kind of tried it at first and then
[1667.68 --> 1671.92]  they backed off on it because they have that that low power core and then the four performance ones is
[1671.92 --> 1676.72]  that exactly how it's supposed to work switching for power saving my understanding is that's how the
[1676.72 --> 1681.20]  octa core is supposed to work come on you're not going to benefit from an octa core no like four
[1681.20 --> 1686.00]  equal cores it's nuts and the octa core is clocked at 1.6 gigahertz so it's going to vary depending on
[1686.00 --> 1691.44]  region what spec you get so the htc1 by contrast you're going to get the same spec regardless of
[1691.44 --> 1697.20]  region but there's six different versions supporting different bands for different regions that makes
[1697.20 --> 1702.24]  sense but you get the same cpu regardless yeah um what else have they changed spec wise so they've added
[1702.24 --> 1706.64]  so it's a five inch 1080p i keep holding this because for all intents and purposes i'll hold this far
[1706.64 --> 1713.12]  enough away that you can't tell uh it's a five inch 1080p display amo led the rumors were that the
[1713.12 --> 1719.20]  amo led uh production line wasn't ready yet and it was going to be lcd but very exciting so you're
[1719.20 --> 1724.32]  going to get those here deep rich blacks power savings assuming you're not looking at really bright stuff
[1724.32 --> 1731.28]  all the time that's really exciting um it's going to come with 4.2.2 jellybean ridiculous 12 megapixel
[1731.28 --> 1738.00]  camera 13 13 13 yeah 13 megapixel camera with two on the front cam and that leads us to another
[1738.00 --> 1741.36]  sort of comparison point between the s we're not even going to be able to talk about the one because
[1741.36 --> 1750.00]  we're blending it in here so htc went for a bold departure from whatever very bold instead of a high
[1750.00 --> 1755.52]  megapixel rear camera they have a four megapixel rear camera hold on i'm gonna let that sink in for a moment
[1755.52 --> 1763.36]  there and you know what's kind of stupid is i had all my notes for the htc uh unboxing that we did
[1763.36 --> 1768.48]  earlier deleted them all and i deleted them as we went but yes for undo i think i've got it they're
[1768.48 --> 1775.04]  calling it ultra pixel ultra pixel camera sensor so this is a four megapixel third inch sensor with an
[1775.04 --> 1781.52]  f 2.0 lens and optical image stabilization that they're saying because of the larger pixels and the
[1781.52 --> 1786.80]  large sensor is actually able to capture more light and more detail even though the resolution
[1786.80 --> 1792.64]  that will appear when you right click properties resolution is actually lower and you were dinking
[1792.64 --> 1797.04]  around with it a little bit in the car on the way back and it looks like and also based on reviews that
[1797.04 --> 1801.28]  we're seeing of the phone that might be true it looks really good more megapixels may not be the
[1801.28 --> 1805.36]  solution so uh anyway samsung has a 13 megapixel camera on this bad boy
[1805.36 --> 1812.16]  um it's available in a variety of different internal storage configurations and it does have
[1812.16 --> 1818.56]  a micro sd slot which the one does not that to me is so confusing the way htc continues to not
[1818.56 --> 1824.24]  implement micro sd in their high-end phones i personally never actually filled my iphone 416 gig
[1824.24 --> 1830.24]  and you don't like but not everyone's like me some people want more storage there's their spot like
[1830.24 --> 1834.08]  they could have put a spot right on the bottom there just put a micro sd slot there for crying out
[1834.08 --> 1841.28]  loud like you can't take off the back okay you can't replace the battery okay okay make an external
[1841.28 --> 1846.48]  plug-in for it's a really small chip with that said the one only comes in 32 gig and 64 gig
[1846.48 --> 1853.28]  configurations big so i would never manage to filter i know that i actually will both of us won't i stream
[1853.28 --> 1858.08]  video to myself over my data plan i have a pretty generous data plan so i don't worry about it too much
[1858.88 --> 1862.80]  okay what else they got oh yeah so there you can interact with the touchscreen without quite touching it
[1862.80 --> 1867.44]  although i don't know how valuable that is uh it apparently pauses video if you look away although
[1867.44 --> 1873.12]  their camera-based eye tracking features have never necessarily worked for everyone so i don't know
[1873.12 --> 1882.32]  about that uh s travel trip advisor oh they're adding some of the cool features from the galaxy camera
[1882.32 --> 1887.60]  which we shot in ncix tech tips of today and it's actually really cool yeah it's actually pretty awesome
[1887.60 --> 1892.80]  i just wish it had a phone in it yeah okay we were talking about this the galaxy camera is running
[1892.80 --> 1899.92]  android yes and android jellybean and we were thinking if you just add like a speaker and a mic
[1899.92 --> 1908.00]  yeah it's got it supports it supports um it supports data it supports data with a micro sim yeah yeah so if
[1908.00 --> 1913.04]  you're gonna have a plan for the stupid thing and you don't actually and and if you're one of the i mean
[1913.04 --> 1919.36]  let's face it there are people out there who don't care about a thin phone these people exist and the
[1919.36 --> 1925.28]  galaxy camera is not that thick like it's probably if i took look at all the samsung product placement
[1925.28 --> 1930.24]  here samsung ssds like if you took sort of a phone and a couple ssds it's kind of like that without the
[1930.24 --> 1935.76]  lens sticking out expand your storage today strap an ssd to your phone i might be the kind of person who
[1935.76 --> 1940.64]  would actually say you know what for the sake of having an awesome camera and video camera as a vlogger
[1940.64 --> 1946.96]  maybe i don't care about a slim phone anymore if i'm going somewhere i've got my backpack that's right
[1946.96 --> 1952.80]  would you actually mind putting your phone slash camera in like a drink pouch or something on your
[1952.80 --> 1959.84]  backpack if you can play games on it it would be cool if it had the functionality so that i could bounce
[1959.84 --> 1967.04]  my sim right or just get you can get a supplementary sim yeah or do something like that share the plan
[1967.04 --> 1971.76]  like that if i could share the plan that would be awesome like a self family plan for your camera and
[1971.76 --> 1975.68]  your phone and your tablet or something because and your notebook or something like that yeah because
[1975.68 --> 1978.96]  there's some times that i'm gonna go out and i don't have my bag because that's probably where we're
[1978.96 --> 1985.28]  headed and i see no reason why i shouldn't be able to take a phone call on my notebook if i feel like it
[1985.28 --> 1990.00]  yeah or on my camera if i feel like it why not and while everyone's talking about everything
[1990.00 --> 1996.00]  getting smaller and stuff and like phones getting thinner cameras like you need the sensor you need the
[1996.00 --> 2001.36]  lenses you need the distance you have to have that distance well neither of us are actually experts
[2001.36 --> 2007.68]  on cameras we know basic physics we know diesel and we know diesel we knew this before we knew yes
[2007.68 --> 2014.80]  that's true and making the pixels small enough to the point where like uh like the the the i forget
[2014.80 --> 2021.44]  what it's called whatever this light wavelengths yeah where the light wavelength actually is not even
[2021.44 --> 2026.16]  gonna be able to hit yeah because the pixel is too small you're trying to go into a box this big
[2026.16 --> 2030.80]  you're just with wavelengths like this you're just over sampling yeah so so yeah that's that's an
[2030.80 --> 2035.36]  exciting departure what else we got from samsung's phone so they amped up the battery life they amped
[2035.36 --> 2040.72]  up the gpu in a big way much more powerful should be much more competitive uh samsung nox will be
[2040.72 --> 2046.08]  supported so if you want to bring your own device byod is a big trend right now um so you'll have like a
[2046.08 --> 2053.04]  safety spot verse like where your your uh your your work can um sort of admin it for you and you can
[2053.04 --> 2058.32]  vpn and then you'll have like a consumer one where your facebook pictures aren't not going to be
[2058.32 --> 2063.84]  accessible to your office or anything like that however blackberry is moving their secure workstation
[2063.84 --> 2070.64]  over to ios and android or secure workspace yeah secure workspace so maybe nox is coming along at a
[2070.64 --> 2076.32]  time when it may not even end up mattering although this is interesting because in my opinion if blackberry
[2076.32 --> 2082.48]  did this two maybe three years ago i think they would be in a way better position because blackberry's
[2082.48 --> 2088.80]  whole thing is workplace yep like it's always it's always been like they're they are the business phone
[2088.80 --> 2094.00]  or at least they were they were that's the problem a lot of people started moving their blackberry servers
[2094.00 --> 2097.36]  out and their blackberry security and all that kind of stuff because people weren't using blackberries
[2097.36 --> 2102.40]  anymore if blackberry rolled this out so that people all the businesses kept their blackberry
[2102.40 --> 2108.40]  infrastructure so your theory is that then when blackberry got competitive on hardware again again
[2108.40 --> 2114.00]  they'd be they would be ready easier to reintegrate everywhere right whereas if there's an infrastructure
[2114.00 --> 2121.04]  change yeah because now people that is a very competitive phone oh yeah for sure um now people that
[2121.04 --> 2125.04]  ditched businesses that ditched are going to have to if they want to roll out blackberries again
[2125.04 --> 2130.08]  go back again and doing another change is going to be hard to push through management and you look
[2130.08 --> 2136.56]  at how long ios and android were superior to blackberry and yet how long it took businesses to move away
[2136.56 --> 2144.08]  from blackberry because it was so good like how how how superior you have to be to drive someone to
[2144.08 --> 2151.68]  your solution versus how mediocre you can be and coast on it yeah it's ridiculous and like at the same
[2151.68 --> 2156.08]  time battle but i'm kind of rooting for them yeah i want blackberry to live i really want blackberry to
[2156.08 --> 2161.36]  live the z10 is an awesome phone i want to actually use it's super light it's kind of like iphone 5 light
[2161.36 --> 2169.28]  like just no super like i like uh along those lines the s4 is getting lighter than the s3 and the htc1
[2169.28 --> 2178.80]  has some heft to it with its like sexy uh aluminum 200 minutes on a machine uh shell that is just blah it's like
[2178.80 --> 2185.12]  like very premium compared to this was an interesting one quick thing to add about blackberry
[2185.12 --> 2190.24]  i think if they still like just to bounce back on this again yeah if they still had their servers in
[2190.24 --> 2194.80]  place so if they gave out their software what they could have done with the z10 release is say look
[2194.80 --> 2200.48]  now we have another awesome phone with some added features for right blackberry secure workspace so
[2200.48 --> 2205.76]  they could have differentiated and been a been a standardized platform which would have driven more sales
[2205.76 --> 2212.56]  anyways continue right uh okay what else we got here uh s voice blah blah have we missed anything
[2212.56 --> 2217.04]  oh it has wireless wireless ac although i have no idea what performance is going to be like because
[2217.04 --> 2222.64]  based on our experience with like a usb ac adapter it probably won't be any different from n it's that's
[2222.64 --> 2229.84]  my guess and like power power hungry i mean the actual full performance ac solutions we run into have
[2229.84 --> 2235.60]  heat sinks as big as a phone on them a little bit bigger actually yeah so uh we don't have it here
[2235.60 --> 2243.36]  do we available with 1632 or 64 gigs with plus the micro sd slot and i think that's pretty much it so
[2243.36 --> 2250.40]  let's wrap up with some of the highlights of the htc1 so this has got the same uh the same snapdragon 600
[2250.40 --> 2256.64]  processor in it two gigs of ram just like the s4 it's got that ultra pixel camera it's got the ability to
[2256.64 --> 2265.92]  take zoe's zoe zoe zoe zoe zoe zoe zoe zoe so it's a four to five still frames at a time while
[2265.92 --> 2271.84]  recording 1080p video which is very cool i think yeah and the idea is that you'll have kind of like
[2271.84 --> 2277.76]  little talking talking snippets uh like motion snippets kind of like uh like the newspapers and
[2277.76 --> 2282.96]  the portraits in harry potter daily profit yeah like in the daily profit and i think it's it's either
[2282.96 --> 2286.96]  going to be really neat or it's going to be kind of gimmicky and i won't end up using it but i
[2286.96 --> 2291.44]  actually don't know it's not one of those things like um where you you look at it and you're just
[2291.44 --> 2295.44]  like oh skip through this stuff tell me the spec of the stupid thing because i don't care about these
[2295.44 --> 2302.08]  gimmicky features so i'm actually willing to give that a shot um boom sound is a huge innovation and
[2302.08 --> 2308.40]  that's something that samsung could have done front facing speakers come on guys why did this take so long
[2308.40 --> 2313.60]  every tablet and every smartphone from now on should have front facing speakers you can write
[2313.60 --> 2319.52]  me down as having said that because it matters if you actually expect this to be a content consumption
[2319.52 --> 2326.16]  device music movies games all of them benefit from front facing speakers because cupping your hand
[2326.16 --> 2331.84]  around the back of a phone to hear it properly is stupid and all the complaints i get from people and
[2331.84 --> 2335.68]  it's funny i get a lot of complaints about the audio levels being too low which is why we boosted them up
[2335.68 --> 2341.44]  tonight uh people are like oh i can't hear because i'm on my phone and i'm like oh it's because of
[2341.44 --> 2347.04]  your stupid crappy ultrabook or phone speaker that doesn't actually go loud enough and people who reply
[2347.04 --> 2351.28]  to those people and say oh just turn your volume up they don't understand you guys are on a phone not
[2351.28 --> 2355.84]  on like a desktop computer where you can just crank it up so we're trying to get that addressed in recent
[2355.84 --> 2361.20]  videos and i hope we've done a pretty good job of that so uh there's that they have an infrared emitter
[2361.20 --> 2365.20]  and uh receiver built into the power button which i think is a really elegant way to do that
[2365.20 --> 2371.68]  so you can use it as uh as a universal remote and of course i mean the chassis is just outstanding
[2371.68 --> 2377.20]  it's really easy to hold in spite of the fact that it is 4.7 inch and i do have small hands
[2377.20 --> 2381.36]  uh it goes almost dead to edge and it is 1080p just like the s4 so this is basically
[2382.32 --> 2386.96]  i guess it's also not out yet but i think it's going to be out first it's basically like a higher
[2386.96 --> 2392.72]  end s4 and then slightly lower clocks much better build quality right talking about release dates
[2392.72 --> 2397.20]  um samsung s4 is i believe april 20th
[2399.20 --> 2405.20]  um so coming soon exciting about a month august no it is well that's nope that's something completely
[2405.20 --> 2411.20]  different okay so i don't know the release dates oh that was saints row four by the way we don't know
[2411.20 --> 2416.24]  so forget it we have no idea okay so the last bit about phones we're not going to talk about phones
[2416.24 --> 2423.12]  anymore after this i don't think is that htc's cmo actually came out i don't think i told you this yet
[2423.12 --> 2429.36]  fight fighting words came out and said samsung's galaxy s4 is quote unquote more of the same
[2429.36 --> 2437.28]  whoa looking to grab some headlines there hey boss that might be a good tactic for them right now that
[2437.28 --> 2443.92]  might be the way to marketing sort of ride on the coattails of the samsung marketing engine which
[2443.92 --> 2448.88]  exists now for the mobile product so okay last thing last thing actual last thing so guys for those of
[2448.88 --> 2454.08]  you who have been asking me to do an i switched for android i am doing it i'm going to be using the
[2454.08 --> 2460.80]  htc one as my android weapon of choice i'm done with windows phone 8 we'll be giving away the 8s
[2460.80 --> 2466.80]  soon actually as well as a bunch of phones on the forum uh soon uh hopefully next week i guess
[2468.16 --> 2471.92]  think we can launch it it depends let's try and look we're gonna stuff we're gonna try and launch it
[2471.92 --> 2476.16]  next week um but yeah i'm gonna do an android i switch and if there's anyone from blackberry watching
[2476.16 --> 2480.16]  please let me know and i'd love to do a blackberry i switched after that so i can give you guys that
[2480.16 --> 2485.52]  noob's perspective i've used android pretty extensively on tablet but i haven't used it
[2485.52 --> 2490.32]  much on a phone yeah so this should be this should be fun uh why don't we do a little bit of twitter
[2490.32 --> 2494.32]  and then let's move into your downgrade unless you had something you really wanted to do uh nope but
[2494.32 --> 2499.92]  considering we peeped at it a second ago saints row 4 is announced i think this is one of if not the
[2499.92 --> 2507.92]  one of the first games to be announced since the thq since thq was dissolved people are asking me to do an
[2507.92 --> 2514.88]  os 10 i switched yeah over my dead body you can quote me on that too yeah seriously um saints row 4
[2514.88 --> 2521.84]  release date august 20th in the states august 23rd in europe oh awesome so i i think that's the first
[2521.84 --> 2527.60]  game that has been announced since the since thq was dissolved i might be wrong so don't quote me on
[2527.60 --> 2535.68]  that okay cool yeah um blah blah blah blah like first game announced that was a part of thq obviously
[2535.68 --> 2542.56]  can either of you guys recommend that what's that cm storm mouse we use at the office
[2543.92 --> 2548.40]  spawn oh it's the spawn okay sorry i we haven't tried the sentinel advance 2 mouse but the spawn is
[2548.40 --> 2552.48]  actually better way better than i thought it was nice for really nice for claw yeah really nice claw
[2552.48 --> 2557.20]  tracks well tracks on a variety of surfaces we've used it extensively now because it's hooked up to our
[2557.20 --> 2563.68]  display computer in the ncix tech tip studio so um yeah let's move into i don't see anything that
[2563.68 --> 2570.24]  interesting on twitter so uh let's move on to your downgrade so why don't you start can i actually
[2570.24 --> 2574.16]  just steal that sandwich from you and then you can make a new one and i'm going to take a couple bites
[2574.16 --> 2578.88]  while you talk about your experience with windows 8 i'd like you to cover it from a number of different
[2578.88 --> 2584.64]  angles i actually um have them here yeah switch switch to my laptop just throw it on top of there and i'm
[2584.64 --> 2592.24]  gonna go now down on your sandwich how long using for it each how long using it for each yeah in like
[2592.24 --> 2596.40]  each of those different scenarios so you used it on notebook desktop and you haven't really spent much
[2596.40 --> 2603.12]  time with it on touch but you spent some right touch okay i've spent basically a completely negligible
[2603.12 --> 2608.88]  amount start with why you started on windows 8. okay i started on windows 8 because uh my laptop was a
[2608.88 --> 2614.48]  development laptop and i got windows 8 from school so i was like hey might as well do it so i started
[2614.48 --> 2620.00]  with the developer preview um it was for a laptop though and all i really did on that laptop was
[2620.64 --> 2627.12]  basic coding which is in via inside an environment so windows 8 isn't really gonna mess with that that
[2627.12 --> 2633.04]  much and then i was exporting that and testing it on other machines not my own machine um and then
[2633.04 --> 2639.60]  basic web browsing like i wasn't doing very much with that laptop at all so didn't really get tons
[2639.60 --> 2643.52]  of usage out of that and that was not a touch screen laptop you had some frustrations at the beginning
[2643.52 --> 2649.28]  like shutting down i oh okay i had some frustrations a lot of frustrations shutting down i find getting
[2649.28 --> 2654.24]  to the charms menu if you don't have like this is a touch screen windows 8 laptop that i'm on right now
[2654.24 --> 2659.52]  if you have a touch screen you just swipe in and it comes in very nicely and you swipe out and it goes
[2659.52 --> 2665.44]  up very nicely and that's awesome if you don't have a touch screen it sucks um that's mainly to do with
[2665.44 --> 2669.36]  when it first came out i've noticed got a little bit better but i still don't like it i don't like
[2669.36 --> 2677.60]  putting my mouse there and like waiting then having it just not come up and then i'm like guys i want to
[2677.60 --> 2685.68]  can i can i shut down please and then metro like or i guess not metro modern ui is that its official name
[2685.68 --> 2692.00]  modern ui is not for me at all i don't like it um again maybe a lot better for touch screen
[2692.88 --> 2698.16]  almost definitely a lot better for touch screen but i'm not into it as desktop user experience it looks
[2698.16 --> 2706.64]  amazing it feels really good but it takes too long like i just want to press start type in my stuff and
[2706.64 --> 2714.16]  go for it that was resolved by windows 8 classic start which i downloaded through night night can i uh can i
[2714.16 --> 2719.52]  chime in on modern ui so one of the issues with modern ui and you look at even other popular
[2719.52 --> 2727.52]  touchscreen interfaces like ios and android they are very touchy very swipey but they don't actually
[2727.52 --> 2732.32]  get rid of the folder structure yeah they still have it and it's still good and that was one of the
[2732.32 --> 2737.20]  frustrations i had with windows phone 8 and i think is similar to your frustration with modern ui because
[2737.20 --> 2743.84]  if modern ui had tiles but you could actually have sub tiles you probably would use it i would
[2743.84 --> 2748.80]  probably be fine carry on that probably would not be a big deal at all um i'm kind of a sucker for
[2748.80 --> 2755.36]  having cool backgrounds um so i like seeing my desktop and i like having a clean desktop i always go
[2755.36 --> 2761.04]  uh view don't show icons so i can have nice very very clean backgrounds even on my phone the home
[2761.04 --> 2769.84]  screen of my phone is completely blank um if i can get past all these pop-ups the home screen of my
[2769.84 --> 2773.76]  phone is completely blank you can't really see very well right there but there's no icons except for
[2773.76 --> 2776.96]  the mandatory ones at the bottom which i can probably get rid of if i rom it with something
[2776.96 --> 2781.44]  weird but it is not currently wrong with something weird so there's mandatory icons on the bottom
[2781.44 --> 2789.20]  um okay so those are like the initial feelings with my laptop although not a big deal and i just kind
[2789.20 --> 2795.92]  of left it there because that was not a high usage laptop i'll go into that but i didn't really do that
[2795.92 --> 2801.36]  way too much on my laptop anyways um then i'm like okay windows 8 is released i have an official
[2801.36 --> 2807.20]  version i'm gonna try and dive in because i i had to reinstall uh my windows 7 installation on my
[2807.20 --> 2812.56]  desktop was pretty messed up and was probably going to stop booting pretty soon because of how messed up
[2812.56 --> 2820.08]  it was that was my fault by the way i'm not gonna go way too into it but yeah um i had to reinstall so i
[2820.08 --> 2824.72]  was like okay i might as well dive in and try windows 8 i've got everything on my data drive anyways
[2824.72 --> 2828.16]  i'm just reinstalling an operating system and basically nine-nighting my program so it's not
[2828.16 --> 2833.20]  really that big of a deal um nine-night by the way if you're wondering why i keep saying this weird word
[2833.20 --> 2839.04]  it's n-i-n-i-t-e and then just that dot com and you can go to the website it's really awesome way to
[2839.04 --> 2843.36]  install a whole bucket full of programs that you usually install when you're setting up a new computer
[2843.36 --> 2850.48]  anyways anyways okay so user experience with my desktop a few random problems that i haven't seen a ton of
[2850.48 --> 2854.56]  people complain about um but i know it's not my hardware because i've tried it with other
[2854.56 --> 2861.28]  installs with windows 8 and another uh no i mean uh other installs with windows 7 sorry it's i get
[2861.28 --> 2869.36]  random screen flickers where it will just like in about a quarter of a second it'll just invert my
[2869.36 --> 2874.88]  screen and then flip it back and i'm like whoa what just happened and then other times it'll just go
[2874.88 --> 2881.28]  completely black screen but only on my main monitor and it's not my driver i recently like i like i've done
[2881.28 --> 2889.92]  tons of troubleshooting for it um then i've got other problems like just just weird like things
[2889.92 --> 2894.64]  won't really work very well like have a lot of problems with usb3 uh really you hadn't told me about
[2894.64 --> 2901.28]  that one i kind of got it working but like it's still just like sometimes it won't detect things um
[2901.28 --> 2910.00]  and just like just weird problems with that some games like i can't play crisis warhead speaking of
[2910.00 --> 2916.08]  games not being able to be played over here you guys can kind of see it this test bench is i'm doing
[2916.08 --> 2923.04]  8350 versus 3570k i've done pretty much all actually yeah all of the windows 7 testing that didn't take me
[2923.04 --> 2929.28]  very long because everything worked and then i had to set up a new ssd i knew everything with windows 8 and
[2929.28 --> 2932.88]  the idea was we're going to do windows 8 versus windows 7 we're going to do windows 8 on its own
[2932.88 --> 2938.08]  we're going to do like like we're going to try and do a whole bunch of stuff to add on to logan's
[2938.08 --> 2943.04]  testing with 3570k versus 8350 so i want to do a whole bunch of scenarios that he may not have done
[2943.04 --> 2946.80]  yet so we can just add to the discussion because that's a really interesting really good discussion
[2947.44 --> 2956.80]  um i couldn't play witcher 2 wouldn't play metro 2033 would not pull any save files from the iSCSI for
[2956.80 --> 2967.84]  who knows why um dirt 3 wouldn't play like all this stuff would not run at all so i tried reinstalling
[2967.84 --> 2974.08]  just absolutely everything and i think i'm going to be trying that again on monday hopefully if i have
[2974.08 --> 2978.96]  some time i'll probably have some time um so hopefully that will actually work this time and that's not my
[2978.96 --> 2984.64]  own personal rig but that is something i've directly worked on so that is a personal experience um
[2984.64 --> 2990.88]  uh what were some of the other problems certain programs have weird permission requirements like
[2991.36 --> 2998.56]  for steam to be able to run you need to run it as an administrator why it's steam come on for xfire to
[2998.56 --> 3006.96]  be able to run on startup it needs to be always run as an administrator what why right like why that's so
[3006.96 --> 3012.40]  weird and like a lot of these problems were like okay i guess i'll go change that and allow this program
[3012.40 --> 3017.92]  to have administrator rights for whatever reason um but it's just and it wasn't that big of a deal
[3017.92 --> 3022.96]  but it was the screen problems that i had which finally did we get into the bit where we assumed
[3022.96 --> 3027.52]  windows 7 and windows 8 would have equal gaming performance because they're based on the same
[3027.52 --> 3031.28]  kernel using the same driver pretty much wasn't even going to talk about those numbers but we can bring
[3031.28 --> 3034.88]  it up if you don't mind talking about it before the video yeah well we're not let's not go into depth
[3034.88 --> 3041.52]  but guys we have a windows 7 versus windows 8 using intel and amd i told them set of gaming
[3041.52 --> 3048.72]  comparisons coming and we are seeing some pretty interesting weird 20 performance drops going from
[3048.72 --> 3053.68]  windows 7 to windows 8. and then sometimes where sometimes equal and then sometimes where there's a
[3053.68 --> 3060.24]  huge drop but then that's without anti-aliasing and then i add anti-aliasing and nothing changes for
[3060.24 --> 3065.92]  frame rates like exact same frame rates re-running these to replicate to see if we can replicate it
[3065.92 --> 3070.72]  and it's just like bizarro land kind of stuff and re-running them like a lot more than i normally do
[3070.72 --> 3075.84]  because i'm like no no no this is weird so with all of that said i think you and i can both still
[3075.84 --> 3082.24]  agree windows 8 is optimal for a device like this it's awesome for touch yeah it's great for touch it's
[3082.24 --> 3087.12]  great for tablets it's awesome all that kind of stuff and i mean if you want a mobile x86 platform so
[3087.12 --> 3092.80]  this is the iconia w700 we have an unboxing that's going to be uploaded soon outstanding something
[3092.80 --> 3098.40]  like a touch notebook would you go windows 7 or windows 8. for most my use cases for a notebook
[3098.40 --> 3101.44]  i'm not gaming whoa i totally missed that i'm not gaming
[3104.80 --> 3111.68]  for most my use cases for a notebook so not gaming um web browsing work in excel work in powerpoint
[3111.68 --> 3117.20]  work in word all that kind of stuff yeah yeah and honestly i love this notebook so much yeah
[3117.20 --> 3121.20]  in fact i'll take it back from you now um and windows 8 is part of it the touch screen
[3121.20 --> 3125.12]  touch screen is one of those things where people say oh i can scroll just as easily with my keyboard
[3125.12 --> 3129.12]  and mouse you know what you don't necessarily want to sit with your hands on your computer
[3129.12 --> 3134.56]  while you read an article so maybe you want to rest them and maybe it's faster to just go scroll
[3134.56 --> 3140.88]  scroll scroll and sometimes the user experience of just being able to go uh that yeah or i want to do this and
[3140.88 --> 3146.56]  just like touch the things it's kind of nice instead of using these very interfaces um so
[3146.56 --> 3152.32]  yeah just to recap i don't hate windows 8. i don't even dislike it it's just not perfect for my desktop
[3152.32 --> 3157.84]  user experience i will probably stick with it on my laptop um and i don't have a tablet so yeah i
[3157.84 --> 3163.76]  probably won't be moving to windows 8 on my desktop um i just installed windows 7 last night on my personal
[3163.76 --> 3169.76]  rig i had to reformat because of a situation where i accidentally unplugged half of my raid array
[3170.40 --> 3173.60]  while the computer was powered on and that doesn't really work so well with raid zero yeah
[3173.60 --> 3180.48]  raid zero it's not a good thing um so anyway i went windows 7 partly because of the gaming experience
[3180.48 --> 3184.40]  that we're having on the test bench here although i don't know how much of that could be just
[3185.76 --> 3190.24]  we need to we need to do a lot more we haven't replicated it on a second machine yet
[3190.24 --> 3196.32]  yeah we can do that as well yeah so you know take all that with a grain of salt um but aside from
[3196.32 --> 3201.60]  that spending some more time with it on the notebook here i mean i don't like having things like control
[3201.60 --> 3207.44]  panel moved around on me i don't like having things like search moved around on me um and the search is
[3207.44 --> 3212.32]  weird because it can only search in like files settings that's exactly what i meant the categories of
[3212.32 --> 3220.16]  search i find frustrating like why um the start menu fixes a lot of the issues but not necessarily
[3220.16 --> 3224.56]  quite all of them and it has its own kind of problems classic start has its own problems and
[3224.56 --> 3230.08]  i really like arrow glass yeah which is kind of dorky but i like being able to see through the top of
[3230.08 --> 3236.80]  things and like you know what's weird you can make a transparency for some of the stuff but not all but
[3236.80 --> 3242.48]  not everything like the bottom bar the task bar will go transparent yeah but then the top bar does
[3242.48 --> 3248.40]  not bars will not yeah and like at first he brought that up he's like oh i miss arrow glass i'm like no
[3248.40 --> 3255.60]  big deal and then i'm like oh well i use it i kind of want it back i use it i use it to see what's under
[3255.60 --> 3261.28]  stuff like even just that top bar that little sliver and it just looks right oh i know it looks so good
[3261.28 --> 3266.48]  like you should be able to see through it like no i don't know not a big deal one thing that i'm gonna miss
[3266.48 --> 3272.80]  a lot which you again don't care about wait no not the file copy no okay file copy is amazing
[3273.68 --> 3279.04]  i wish i could just like download the file copy ui i mean terra copy is okay but it's not well
[3279.04 --> 3286.72]  integrated with windows no not very well and like yeah whatever um and then and then task manager the
[3286.72 --> 3291.04]  new task manager is no no i agree 100 new task manager is outstanding so i'm gonna miss those two
[3291.04 --> 3296.16]  things and then one thing that you don't care about at all but if you are running a whole bunch of
[3296.16 --> 3301.60]  backgrounds and you have them switching if you have multiple monitors each one can have its own
[3301.60 --> 3307.04]  background there has to be some third party there is third party utility is it pay one you have to pay
[3307.04 --> 3317.28]  for it okay two it just sucks okay so like oh i don't know all right then um yeah so there you go guys
[3317.28 --> 3325.36]  what are your impressions of heart of the swarm okay so i haven't played enough multiplayer yet the
[3325.36 --> 3331.52]  campaign is awesome um if you like rts campaigns especially if you like starcraft i suggest going
[3331.52 --> 3335.76]  and playing it and play it all the way through because the story wraps up kind of nicely there's
[3335.76 --> 3341.92]  a few times where i'm like really did you really just do that why did you just do that but it ends up
[3341.92 --> 3348.48]  wrapping us wrapping up very nicely um multiplayer some of the new units that came out are really cool
[3349.28 --> 3354.32]  interesting fun all that kind of stuff balance i think might be a little bit odd right now
[3354.32 --> 3358.80]  weren't they thinking of removing carriers they were going to remove carriers which was going to remove
[3358.80 --> 3365.44]  me from the game because i just have that's like classic i love carriers man and like whenever i get to
[3365.44 --> 3369.76]  late game it's always fun to just like play normally and then all of a sudden be like carriers
[3369.76 --> 3376.64]  because they never expect it oh so much fun um anyways so and like okay the unbalanced thing
[3377.36 --> 3382.72]  is coming from a person that plays protoss and is finding certain units on protests unbalanced in a
[3382.72 --> 3388.32]  way that they're slightly overpowered so i'm not being biased being like oh taren and zerg are overpowered
[3388.32 --> 3394.88]  like there's certain units on my team that are kind of nuts um there's one flyer unit that has a whole
[3394.88 --> 3398.24]  bunch of abilities but you can change its mode talk as if you're talking to them and they know what you're
[3398.24 --> 3402.64]  talking about you you can change its mode which makes it constantly use energy but that means
[3402.64 --> 3408.48]  that it can now shoot it can't normally auto attack um but it's really fast moving and it doesn't cost
[3408.48 --> 3416.40]  nearly as much as say a void ray um so you can get it in behind mineral lines you can get it in
[3416.40 --> 3421.44]  behind mineral lines really really quickly activate this energy ability and just decimate mineral lines
[3421.44 --> 3426.72]  and then fly them away the energy will constantly go down even if you're not shooting so you have to be
[3426.72 --> 3432.48]  careful with toggling it and stuff but just the speed at which you can clear minion lines or uh
[3433.28 --> 3438.32]  mineral lines is insane and they're really fast and they're not that expensive so you can pump out
[3438.32 --> 3443.36]  three and then jump behind the guy's mineral line and just like clear it and that's game over they'll
[3443.36 --> 3448.72]  just be like sup gg noob have fun making a little bit more money not being able to afford anti-air
[3448.72 --> 3453.52]  turrets and having me just re-wipe your mineral line every time it's they're really good and now like
[3453.52 --> 3458.24]  i've only played a couple multiplayer games i honestly don't even really know the new units for
[3458.24 --> 3462.48]  the other races um so i'm probably not the best person to talk to about this and there might be
[3462.48 --> 3467.92]  really good counters for them and realistically they might suck um but every time i've used them
[3467.92 --> 3475.76]  it's just been kind of ridiculous i've just disallowed the other team from having workers at all so i don't
[3475.76 --> 3482.16]  know that's kind of cool but not fair so yeah really really fun i need to get more used to it
[3482.16 --> 3487.60]  i've been out of starcraft for a while i haven't played for a really long time ladder matches last
[3487.60 --> 3493.28]  night was like the first time i've done ladder matches in months right so i'm pretty out of it but
[3493.28 --> 3498.48]  maybe next stream i'll be able to come back with a much more knowledgeable opinion on it on the
[3498.48 --> 3504.72]  multiplayer side at least so overall recommended for 39.99 i was surprised to see a 39.99 price point it's not
[3504.72 --> 3509.20]  a full price expansion yeah that's awesome that is cool and especially from someone like blizzard
[3509.76 --> 3514.64]  who who's like yeah release full price expansions all the time but then yeah it's not a full price
[3514.64 --> 3520.08]  expansion the campaign is not short i beat it in two days but that was like that was two pretty
[3520.08 --> 3526.08]  intense days i hardly saw him yeah i like would disappear after work and then stay up until like
[3527.76 --> 3533.52]  five or six in the morning and then come back to work the next day you were so crabby in a couple of
[3533.52 --> 3539.36]  those mornings um like you're banned i was gonna i was tempted to be like look you can't play starcraft
[3539.36 --> 3544.80]  until that late at night and come to work cranky like that but i beat it that's what was important
[3545.36 --> 3551.44]  yeah that is the important thing i suppose beating a video game they added a lot of really cool changes
[3551.44 --> 3560.00]  now um there's levels so you're like your person levels up i guess i think you gain levels depending on
[3560.00 --> 3564.96]  what race you're playing so like i'm a whatever level protoss and i could be a different level zerg
[3564.96 --> 3570.96]  i think and while you're playing like as you spawn units as you kill units as you build buildings you
[3570.96 --> 3574.96]  gain experience and then you gain experience depending on like how long the game was and all
[3574.96 --> 3580.72]  this kind of stuff which adds a cool dynamic which is more fun for not the extremely hardcore players
[3580.72 --> 3585.84]  right which is like oh cool i'm leveling up everyone loves more stats like stats and achievements
[3585.84 --> 3592.48]  exactly there's way more of that kind of stuff in the game which honestly it is kind of cheesy but
[3592.48 --> 3597.28]  i just love it it's cool i like leveling up in starcraft i like getting experience in starcraft
[3597.28 --> 3602.48]  because it's just like oh that's cool like i built this unit and then killed this dude so i got experience
[3602.48 --> 3607.44]  for building the unit and i got experience for killing him like i don't know it's kind of cool it is
[3607.44 --> 3612.64]  cheesy but it's kind of cool i like it did you ever ah yes we do have a build log of the week okay i'll have
[3612.64 --> 3616.72]  to i'll have to open that up on there when we get a minute next time you're talking for a bit
[3616.72 --> 3622.08]  but um why don't we move to twitter we've still got a lot here why don't we burn through some of the
[3622.08 --> 3628.72]  quick some of the quick discussion topics so corsair released three gigahertz that's 3000 megahertz
[3628.72 --> 3635.28]  memory um did you see this yet no okay curiously enough they released it under the vengeance branding
[3635.28 --> 3642.40]  rather than dominators yeah so they're vengeance modules so they're not using the custom pcb
[3642.40 --> 3646.48]  they're not using or they might be using a custom pcb okay that i don't know don't quote me on that
[3646.48 --> 3653.84]  but they're vengeance modules they are going to be extremely limited production and extreme overclockers
[3653.84 --> 3658.96]  only need apply because not only do you have to have the three gigahertz memory which is going to be
[3658.96 --> 3665.20]  really expensive for two four gig dims but you will also need to have a cpu that can actually handle
[3665.20 --> 3671.36]  three gigahertz on the uh integrated memory controller and will that they can't all do that will that like
[3671.36 --> 3678.64]  actually heat up ddr3 probably i can't imagine this is like a stock voltage yeah there's no way
[3678.64 --> 3684.00]  that's like because ddr3 doesn't heat up that much no but the binning process that's going into
[3685.04 --> 3689.12]  three gigahertz i don't even want to know that's probably why they're vengeance modules
[3689.92 --> 3697.20]  because the volume of modules that they would have to build to bin enough three gigahertz kits to ship
[3697.20 --> 3701.36]  because vengeance are a higher volume part compared to domineers that's probably what happened
[3702.40 --> 3707.28]  so there you go there's the answer to the question that i couldn't figure out by me yeah yeah someone
[3707.28 --> 3712.08]  just commented in the twitch chat he's like finally he said something you actually need liquid cooling
[3712.08 --> 3716.64]  for but i was like yeah you don't really need to cool ram so maybe you will actually have to cool your
[3716.64 --> 3722.00]  ram i mean these are intended for like liquid nitrogen cooling yeah so they're expecting people to push these
[3722.00 --> 3726.80]  well beyond three gigahertz oh yeah so that's kind of neat if you're into memory overclocking i think
[3726.80 --> 3734.00]  very few people are these days though no as far as i know not so much so there's a rumored oh okay this uh
[3734.00 --> 3741.44]  oh you know what i wanted to do this i'm going to uh i'm going to go to the linus tech tips forum and i'm
[3741.44 --> 3748.96]  going to go to the news section because i do like to check our tech news and reviews section on the forum
[3748.96 --> 3756.40]  and uh pick out guys who posted news threads that i thought were interesting so our three gigahertz
[3756.40 --> 3765.04]  memory news post was from same i kebel i don't know whatever i don't know what that is so at only $749.99
[3765.04 --> 3772.48]  uh this was uh this was posted by one of the members of our forum also there was a post on the amd
[3772.48 --> 3782.56]  7790 and nvidia gtx 655 ti that are rumored to be released at some point so i don't know uh i don't
[3782.56 --> 3785.92]  know anything about these cards to be perfectly honest i don't know if they're real i don't know
[3785.92 --> 3790.00]  if they're actually coming but what i would imagine that they are because i don't think there's any new
[3790.00 --> 3798.88]  architectures coming right now um what i'd imagine they are is they're just overclocked 7770 and uh 650 ti
[3798.88 --> 3805.68]  probably that makes sense because they both overclock well um like 70 7770 particularly is like
[3805.68 --> 3812.00]  yeah a beast overclocker so they could just go okay slightly higher power envelope turn the clock
[3812.00 --> 3815.92]  speed up 7770 is one of my favorite cards to overclock because it's just like
[3818.08 --> 3823.44]  um so that's probably what's coming on that side now they're likely to line up sort of perfectly with
[3823.44 --> 3827.84]  each other because they're going to be speed bumps of cards that compare reasonably well although i'd expect
[3827.84 --> 3836.80]  the 7790 to continue to beat the 655 ti um if that's what they end up being called all this is
[3836.80 --> 3840.80]  complete speculation and rumors i know nothing about them which is why i can actually talk about them
[3840.80 --> 3848.96]  right yeah if i knew i wouldn't be able to talk about it um because of our results where our overclocked
[3848.96 --> 3855.92]  7770 competes very favorably against the overclocked 650 ti so that's what leads me to believe that
[3855.92 --> 3862.80]  a higher bin of both versions right would favor amd so right uh so there's that one so that one was
[3862.80 --> 3872.48]  posted by artorias on the forum so let's go ahead and i'm gonna like a warrior artorias so he's got
[3872.48 --> 3878.40]  some sapphire's official facebook announcement as well as so he's got references to other sites which is
[3878.40 --> 3884.48]  good we don't want just random rumors that don't refer to anything so that's uh that's exciting so there
[3884.48 --> 3892.24]  was another one this one was the one aha so game developers say playstation 4 will outpower most pcs
[3892.24 --> 3898.48]  for years to come now when we actually click on it this was started by dragon tail dragon tail
[3898.48 --> 3905.36]  that was a bit of a sensationalist headline there because what the game devs actually said if we read
[3905.36 --> 3912.56]  a little bit further here is recent debate about new console something something has developers
[3912.56 --> 3918.56]  starting to come out and say that the ps4 will outperform entry-level hardware in the pc market
[3919.20 --> 3927.60]  that includes graphics cards around four gigs of ram for years to come so okay a couple of things here
[3927.60 --> 3939.68]  um number one is entry-level pc hardware is so far behind high-end pc hardware i mean you look at entry-level
[3939.68 --> 3950.56]  graphics cards things like a 610 a 610 is still basically a low-end fermi like that was is a 610 i don't think
[3950.56 --> 3957.92]  610 is even kepler i don't think so and and even like back when in the 400 series i think they read
[3957.92 --> 3963.52]  badged 210s at some point and made those 400 series like there's a lot of rebadging that goes on
[3963.52 --> 3967.92]  happens all the time on the low-end stuff because quite frankly they sell them for so little that it's
[3967.92 --> 3972.96]  hardly even worth the r d to redevelop the chips the people who are buying these cards are more interested
[3972.96 --> 3980.40]  in features like multi-monitor than gaming um i i maintain you shouldn't buy a graphics card that's less
[3980.40 --> 3984.40]  than a hundred dollars if you're spending less than a hundred dollars on a graphics card you might as
[3984.40 --> 3990.16]  well put it in a piggy bank and save up for a platform upgrade because you can get apu platforms
[3990.16 --> 3996.72]  you buy a new cpu memory and motherboard for a couple hundred bucks that are going to outperform an entry-level
[3996.72 --> 4001.52]  graphics card from either nvidia or amd we have videos from quite a while ago now actually but
[4001.52 --> 4007.52]  apu videos they do really well yeah like outstanding surprisingly if you want entry-level gaming
[4007.52 --> 4012.32]  performance don't buy an entry-level gaming graphics card because that isn't what it is buy an apu just
[4012.32 --> 4019.92]  do it cpu performance is decent it's not it's not on par with intel but the graphics core is way ahead
[4019.92 --> 4024.96]  of what intel's delivering right now although haswell may shift things around a little bit because i was
[4024.96 --> 4033.12]  looking at the uh the amount of core space that intel is allocating to gpu cpu is like not going up
[4033.12 --> 4037.76]  at all in terms of the actual size like it's going to be just optimizations from what i can tell but
[4037.76 --> 4043.68]  then what they're doing on the gpu is they're like doubling it wow like way more die space so that's
[4043.68 --> 4049.92]  that's exciting well they needed to compete there um so so anyway so yeah i mean saying something like it
[4049.92 --> 4055.12]  they'll be competitive with entry i mean xbox 360 is probably still competitive with entry-level pcs
[4055.12 --> 4060.16]  that's like a six-year-old console it's like wow how far into your crystal ball did you have to look
[4060.16 --> 4066.40]  for that with that said the vast majority of people out there are not running gaming computers and that's
[4066.40 --> 4071.68]  something that we enthusiasts forget about sometimes there's a lot of 8800s there's a lot of 260s there's a
[4071.68 --> 4079.52]  lot of stuff that's way crappier than that that's true there's a lot of like you know 8600 gts still
[4079.52 --> 4084.80]  out there there's a lot of 8500s still out there a lot of previous stuff still out there there's a lot
[4084.80 --> 4090.56]  of gamers who are still living at home with their parents using whatever computer their parents bought
[4090.56 --> 4096.08]  from a big box store one of my like they want to play games but one of my really really really good
[4096.08 --> 4105.60]  buddies is running an eco-friendly 8800 that only has one uh pci express power plug-in that's exactly
[4105.60 --> 4111.68]  the same as the regular 8800 there's a little tidbit for you it was just a uh it was just a revision to
[4111.68 --> 4116.80]  the core that made it slightly more power efficient its power its performance is exactly the same as a
[4116.80 --> 4122.72]  non-eco well we've benched it and they were different that's very strange that's binning or something that happened there
[4122.72 --> 4128.88]  that's very strange we'll have to look i'll have to look into that outside of the stream
[4128.88 --> 4137.52]  um but yeah he still plays absolutely everything yep and you know the the reality of it is uh the pcs
[4137.52 --> 4142.08]  sort of you know the greatest thing about it and the worst thing about it is the flexibility of the
[4142.08 --> 4150.00]  hardware so you can make a game for pc and if you make a game for 90 of the pcs out there the way blizzard
[4150.00 --> 4156.16]  does you end up with games like diablo 3 that look like they're 10 years old but the reality of
[4156.16 --> 4162.48]  it is that's still a pc game and consoles next generation consoles will be ahead of that level
[4162.48 --> 4167.52]  for a long time yeah because you you can develop for exactly the spec yeah which is nice so there's
[4167.52 --> 4172.80]  that optimization that goes on as well um if we don't have anything we should jump on twitter we
[4172.80 --> 4176.56]  haven't really been on twitter yeah sure let's jump on twitter for a little bit and see if uh
[4176.56 --> 4181.76]  see if anyone's got any twitter things if i could actually get the window open that would be great
[4182.40 --> 4189.20]  there we go i do so love this little uh keyboard mouse thing lol my friend got ripped off at fries
[4189.20 --> 4195.68]  they said 800 watt power supply water cooling etc nope he wasted money on a gt643 gig and that's another
[4195.68 --> 4199.92]  thing about that statement from the game downs what do you mean a four gigabyte graphics card that doesn't
[4199.92 --> 4206.08]  mean anything you can put four gigabyte in fact i think someone did put four gigs of memory on a low end
[4206.80 --> 4213.36]  gt600 series i'm just looking at that come on that card is going to be bottlenecked by the time it
[4213.36 --> 4220.72]  fills up 512 megs of vram because any modern game that actually has high res textures a turn them off
[4220.72 --> 4225.84]  because they're not going to run on that card and b you're going to be running at such a low resolution
[4225.84 --> 4232.48]  you're not going to need the vram anyway um we usually mean competitive in terms of performance i think
[4232.48 --> 4240.08]  repping that 3200 integrated gpu i think that's an older one from like the express chipsets that's
[4240.08 --> 4246.16]  not quite the same as an apu just throwing that out there it's me playing games with a 9800 yep 650 ti
[4246.16 --> 4252.00]  with one or two gigs uh vram one one gig vram is fine for 650 ti this is an interesting
[4252.00 --> 4258.08]  the t balancer t balancer oh can you talk about your t balancer uh i've talked about this on the
[4258.08 --> 4263.20]  live streams before so i don't want to bore people yeah but he's saying recommended he's asking if he
[4263.20 --> 4266.88]  should buy one we've talked about why we liked it we haven't talked about why we don't like it it's
[4266.88 --> 4271.84]  really hard to configure it's such a pain really hard to even find an english version of the stupid
[4271.84 --> 4275.52]  software last time i did it which was like a couple years ago mind you i tried to do it more recently and
[4275.52 --> 4280.08]  could not get an english version working i think you have to get the german version yeah and then
[4280.08 --> 4284.48]  you have to figure out how to change it to english within the german version german menus yeah and
[4284.48 --> 4289.36]  apparently that works so like like there's a lot of usability things that are kind of weird but once
[4289.36 --> 4295.92]  you have it set up it's set and forget you never touch it again i didn't touch it for literally years
[4295.92 --> 4299.92]  and it just automatically configured everything through multiple rebuilds of my computer i just
[4299.92 --> 4303.84]  didn't change anything about my t balancer just remembered which fans kind of plugged into what
[4303.84 --> 4308.16]  yeah and like it's awesome but you're gonna have to fight with it a bit that's all okay we are gonna
[4308.16 --> 4312.32]  have a featured rig from the forums a featured build log but i don't i don't want to click on anything
[4312.88 --> 4318.64]  in twitter right now just in case it's like goatsy or something i'm trying to oc my 7770s but can only
[4318.64 --> 4322.64]  get a small overclock you got way higher try turning up the voltage that might be something
[4324.72 --> 4329.44]  oh oh you know what i think i might have made a mistake pc computer geek might be right we usually line
[4329.44 --> 4338.32]  up 7770 with the non-ti don't we yes but then i is lined up with do we even i don't remember okay
[4338.32 --> 4345.84]  you'll have to check that out i'll get that one sec um no we yeah no he's right because it's 650 i'm
[4345.84 --> 4350.32]  just do we even run 650 ti i don't think we do so there you go we were totally wrong in that whole
[4350.32 --> 4357.92]  discussion about that any giveaways today probably no giveaways today yeah we run 650 660 660 ti and 670.
[4357.92 --> 4363.28]  is the aries 2 all sold probably ati can only use physics by running calculations about the cpu
[4363.28 --> 4368.64]  how much of an impact on fps is this well a lot of games it's like kneecapped by the way that physics
[4368.64 --> 4375.52]  is implemented so yeah you never explained cherry mx green switches in your mechanical keyboard tech
[4375.52 --> 4380.32]  quickie video can you explain its advantages and disadvantages it's basically a heavier blue
[4380.32 --> 4385.68]  and the reason we didn't talk about it was because find a keyboard that actually has okay i know there are
[4385.68 --> 4391.28]  some but they're very well yeah but that's not even out yet we're not they're not even supposed
[4391.28 --> 4395.84]  to be talking to us about that you're gonna get them in trouble they previewed at cis they previewed
[4395.84 --> 4401.76]  it at ces but there are very few keyboards out there with cherry mx green and it may gain some
[4401.76 --> 4406.08]  popularity moving forward but they are more expensive and they are much less rare than the
[4406.08 --> 4413.20]  usual blue red brown black key switches they have it on their website as new do they're 99 bucks okay well
[4413.20 --> 4418.00]  there you go okay apparently 99 only is that a tanky list oh yeah that's an expensive tanky list then
[4418.80 --> 4423.76]  yeah that's still the keyboard with green switches all right exciting he just said they're heavier blues
[4423.76 --> 4429.92]  they also have a more accurate actuation point blues have a slight problem that people and like okay this
[4429.92 --> 4436.56]  i use exclusively blues on everything um but blues have a slight problem where if you float right under the
[4436.56 --> 4443.04]  click you can um hit the actuation point repeatedly so there's double tapping issues that people will
[4443.04 --> 4447.60]  have if they're trying to click really really quickly where they'll accidentally go back down before they
[4447.60 --> 4454.32]  click and they'll actuate it too many times so the actuation point is not exactly on the click
[4454.32 --> 4461.28]  greens is way more accurate in that aspect in blues now in saying this blues are pretty darn accurate like
[4461.28 --> 4466.08]  you're not going to have you're not going to have this problem that often but that is a notable
[4466.08 --> 4473.20]  difference is the greens do have a more accurate click and actuation point level okay a little bit
[4473.20 --> 4479.36]  more twitter uh is it worth it to oh uh corsair 200r is a good good budget case uh we're using one for our
[4479.36 --> 4484.56]  video capture pc that we're running on right now is it worth it to get a big bang 2 that supports 128 gigabytes
[4484.56 --> 4490.56]  of ram i don't know if i would run out where are you going to get 128 gigs of ram on an x79 you need 16 gig dims
[4491.12 --> 4499.52]  so good luck with that wait rumors of those are they coming soon non-ecc 16 gig dims rumors okay i
[4499.52 --> 4504.80]  don't know i've just read spending a fortune on it by the time you spent that much on 16 gig dims
[4504.80 --> 4509.68]  if this is for a video editing and rendering station get yourself a dual socket super micro board
[4510.24 --> 4515.68]  throw a couple of xeons in there and then get lower density eight gig dims and fill it up just fill it
[4515.68 --> 4520.32]  up and then you can get your 128 gigs of ram and get more processing power in a proper workstation
[4520.32 --> 4526.72]  platform at the same time probably for a fairly uh not at the price 16 gig dims will probably be
[4526.72 --> 4532.00]  yeah exactly a fairly competitive price it'll probably be cheaper yeah yeah to be honest linus
[4532.00 --> 4536.72]  wanted to get your opinion should i wait for the 900d or get something now like a phantom 630 phantom 630
[4536.72 --> 4543.60]  is not very comparable to the 900d i mean 900d is a monster 630 is quite like it's a mid tower and it's like
[4543.60 --> 4548.48]  full steel and aluminum isn't it yeah it's like full metal for the 900d whereas a very plastic design
[4548.48 --> 4554.24]  for the 630 i think you need to decide exactly what you want and then decide what to buy i'd probably
[4554.24 --> 4563.20]  go with a 79 50 or a 660 ti i mean that's a good uh 34 70 maybe a 660. 660 is a great value or a 78 70
[4563.20 --> 4569.60]  or 78 50. when is slick going to upload videos to his youtube channel that is for that channel that you see
[4569.60 --> 4575.20]  when i comment on youtube videos is for replying to comments on youtube videos i am not planning on
[4575.20 --> 4580.40]  releasing anything on that channel uh slick's personal rig has been updated yep uh people asked
[4580.40 --> 4584.24]  you to talk about your personal rig and we never talked about it during the windows 8 thing okay um
[4584.24 --> 4594.32]  i'm running i'm water cooling with a t-virus and a 120.3 um pa 120.3 donated by someone very gracious
[4594.32 --> 4605.76]  uh i'm running a 2600k and moving to a gtx 670 water cooled so it's very it's very short yeah it's
[4605.76 --> 4611.68]  really short mini card it's literally about this looks really small in the 800d it's a little bit
[4611.68 --> 4617.60]  ridiculous um but it actually kind of works for my water loop yeah because it'll be in the right
[4617.60 --> 4623.12]  position so you won't have to re re plummet and buy new tubing so it actually kind of works um
[4624.40 --> 4628.56]  i have a lot of i don't want to do a personal rig update video because i have a lot of work on that
[4628.56 --> 4634.00]  rig that i need to do before i want to release a personal update video uh the mineral oil rig had
[4634.00 --> 4640.40]  enough novelty in it that it was just kind of awesome um but like currently i love the power supply
[4640.40 --> 4642.96]  that's there's like junk growing in his loop and he doesn't want to show you guys
[4642.96 --> 4649.60]  actually that goes away and comes back because of the silver fittings right now it's not there
[4649.60 --> 4654.40]  is it not there right now no that's weird but it comes back it's the silver fittings it cleans it and
[4654.40 --> 4659.68]  then gets dirty it's because i don't think i have enough if i had silver fittings on my d5
[4660.88 --> 4667.68]  okay i think it would be enough i think my rig has like eight silver fittings in it yeah six yeah okay
[4667.68 --> 4672.80]  um if and adding in that graphics card might actually solve it okay if i add two more silver
[4672.80 --> 4677.36]  fittings there that might actually fix my problem okay or i could just add a kill coil or something
[4677.36 --> 4682.40]  but anyways uh i still need to like sleeve my power supply yeah your power supply looks ghetto it's a
[4682.40 --> 4687.28]  high current ugly it's an awesome power supply yeah high current pro 1200 watt or something ridiculous
[4687.28 --> 4695.28]  like that beast and like unnecessary but whatever um but totally beast and ugly super ugly so i need to
[4695.28 --> 4702.56]  sleeve that um i'm in an 800d but like it's the front looks horrible it's a little bit broken there's some
[4702.56 --> 4709.52]  scratches like i need to be done like it's really beat up um one of my roommates that i had who was
[4709.52 --> 4717.28]  often under the influence utilized the cardboard panels from the box for my 800d to build something
[4718.56 --> 4725.44]  i was i came home and i'm just like what and this was like weeks afterwards because i just had the box
[4725.44 --> 4729.92]  for it in the back room and never really thought about it right and i'm like okay well i can't transport my
[4729.92 --> 4736.16]  800d in a box anymore which is so heavy which is insanely really hard to move around and like have
[4736.16 --> 4741.92]  it not like if it's like like once it gains momentum if it starts moving in the back of the car it's
[4741.92 --> 4747.68]  gonna smack and then that creates scratches so like it's it's an 800d but it's like probably one of the
[4747.68 --> 4753.92]  least attractive 800d's in existence not really um but it's it's not doing so great it's down there it's
[4753.92 --> 4757.20]  down there it's definitely down there so that needs to be replaced i need to just leave my cables like
[4757.20 --> 4760.40]  there's work that needs to be done before i want to release but you're saving for a car
[4761.12 --> 4764.96]  i'm saving up for a car he's saving for a car so he can drive me around for a change instead of the
[4764.96 --> 4772.48]  other way around yeah so like it's gonna be a while but yeah that's that's my rig can we put like um
[4772.48 --> 4778.72]  like benchmarker slash programmer slash chauffeur on your business cards when we have them printed
[4778.72 --> 4783.20]  oh my god we gotta do that that would be so amazing that would be perfect we have to have
[4783.20 --> 4789.28]  chauffeur chauffeur we should have leaky chauffeur you'll have to yeah his car now actually the roof
[4789.28 --> 4794.08]  leaks it's a pontiac which should be all you need to know it's a convertible in bc it got cold and it
[4794.08 --> 4799.76]  cracked it's a pontiac it's an old car it probably leaked at the beginning no no no no no it's an old
[4799.76 --> 4805.44]  car why do you defend the pontiac because i like that car what is good about everything about it is
[4805.44 --> 4813.36]  terrible it doesn't even have cup holders that's stupid it's good what do you mean it's a convertible
[4813.36 --> 4820.88]  you don't need cup holders nothing slides with you i was hoping you wouldn't notice that that's
[4820.88 --> 4827.12]  that's like i can't even compare that to anything that's like saying it's it's a it's a it's a it's
[4827.12 --> 4833.12]  it's a rancher it doesn't need uh windows my first car it's got me around and it's awesome in the summer
[4833.12 --> 4838.64]  it's amazingly awesome in the summer you know the cruise around with the top down in the summer
[4838.64 --> 4847.04]  when it's hot it's just kind of awesome okay pontiac whatever your car really runs oh i need to change
[4847.04 --> 4855.60]  gears okay we're still moving well maybe if i wasn't driving your huge ass around everywhere
[4856.16 --> 4862.32]  my car would still run it was broken you weigh about double what i do what i thought we figured out
[4862.32 --> 4871.84]  and actually no yeah whatever you look like you weigh about twice as hard to look at there bam bam
[4874.48 --> 4879.28]  what was i gonna say i don't care i can't even remember whatever something about your stupid car
[4879.28 --> 4886.00]  i like my car um something about your personal rig oh yeah you're saving up for a car so you're not
[4886.00 --> 4890.16]  going to do all the upgrades right away right away yeah but i am planning like eventually all this will
[4890.16 --> 4895.92]  happen and then i will eventually release a rig update but like i wouldn't i wouldn't hold up for
[4895.92 --> 4903.04]  it uh new slash more fans for my pc or save up for a gtx 680 lightning i don't know if your computer's
[4903.04 --> 4907.28]  really loud i've done cooling upgrades as opposed to performance upgrades but it really depends what
[4907.28 --> 4912.72]  video card you're running now although 680 lightning isn't necessarily the best choice unless you want to
[4912.72 --> 4919.92]  run 3d vision or in videos uh or rather uh 3d vision or physx or figure out what games you play
[4919.92 --> 4924.48]  and then check out some of our videos yeah 79 70 may end up being a better choice for you like something
[4924.48 --> 4932.16]  like a um shoot what's that asus one the matrix one matrix 79 70 is awesome card we did an ncix tech tips
[4932.16 --> 4937.76]  quite a while ago showing that even without the never settle driver it was already the fastest single card
[4937.76 --> 4942.80]  went overclocked to the max and we ran into gains to 680 lightning and the never settle driver is like
[4943.68 --> 4948.40]  kind of a big deal yeah kind of a huge deal sean contributes that windows 8 has been super shady on
[4948.40 --> 4953.52]  his grandmother's new computer apparently to run some microsoft games in windows 8 you need a new app
[4953.52 --> 4958.88]  and steam's not providing it so that might be something for you to look into i'm uh we're probably
[4958.88 --> 4964.48]  not going to do a video on oc basics because we do specific videos on mcix tech tips for every new
[4964.48 --> 4968.72]  platform anyway so just go check out our overclocking guides over there and you should
[4969.84 --> 4976.48]  pick up pretty much most of what you need to know my mouse isn't working oh there it goes yay it's back
[4977.20 --> 4982.00]  honestly the windows 8 comments like the usability of different things is like i was able to deal with
[4982.00 --> 4987.92]  that it's the monitor randomly inverting and going black right that i'm not able to deal with because
[4987.92 --> 4992.56]  like i've died so many times in games just because i'm like oh i have a black screen i can't do anything
[4992.56 --> 4997.68]  for six or seven seconds and in a lot of games when you can't do anything for six or seven seconds
[4997.68 --> 5003.60]  you're kind of screwed um okay a little bit more twitter q a so robert asks if his fx 8350 showing
[5003.60 --> 5009.52]  four physical cores and eight logical cores on task manager is normal and it i don't know is that normal
[5009.52 --> 5015.60]  because pile driver pile pile driver modules have are sort of like a core and a half yeah they're
[5015.60 --> 5021.28]  they're funky but it's not quite like not a core at all the way hyper threading is so it's probably
[5021.28 --> 5025.68]  normal as long as it shows eight logical then it should be fine by the way uh slick's defense
[5027.52 --> 5031.84]  so basically my car is a ferrari it's a pontiac ferrari built by pontiac
[5034.80 --> 5040.24]  slick can drive to wreck beach in his convertible pontiac exactly that is how classy
[5040.24 --> 5050.16]  convertible pontiac is bam and welcome lime fire the lexus lfa has no cup holders and it's an amazing
[5050.16 --> 5054.96]  car don't judge a car by its cup holders okay okay how about this how about the fact that the pontiac
[5054.96 --> 5060.64]  has no cup holders and isn't an amazing car how about the cup holders are just one thing for me to
[5060.64 --> 5070.08]  pick on in in like 20 years all it's needed is new spark plugs okay bam and pretty good runs great
[5070.08 --> 5076.72]  and a serious like non-suckitude makeover uh is slick a family member how is he always with you works me
[5076.72 --> 5082.64]  way too much yeah that's pretty much it i'm not getting paid right now actually you're not no no
[5082.64 --> 5085.92]  although you're salaried so technically you are getting paid right now just not very much
[5085.92 --> 5096.24]  just like really small are you planning a project car i can't imagine you you're not that mechanically
[5096.24 --> 5103.52]  inclined are you i do okay i do all right my dad is and then i kind of get some from there my dad's
[5103.52 --> 5109.04]  kind of a wizard when it comes to anything um chris i don't think we need more heatsink manufacturers
[5109.68 --> 5114.16]  i think sight exiting the north american market was sort of all we needed to know they had good
[5114.16 --> 5120.72]  yeah good unique products and couldn't make it over here because we have enough heatsink manufacturers
[5121.52 --> 5129.44]  be quiet recently moved over even yeah they did recently ish um i have a blah blah blah yep
[5129.44 --> 5133.92]  definitely go for it richard do you think samsung's features are actually useful or just bloatware
[5133.92 --> 5137.60]  ruining android what monitor are you going to use now that your old one broke
[5138.72 --> 5141.12]  my mother always told me if you don't have anything nice to say
[5141.12 --> 5150.96]  don't say anything skip over it and address the next question um i am i don't know he's thinking
[5150.96 --> 5156.40]  about a leonitis yeah i'm looking into the leonitis i'm thinking about getting repaired i would love to
[5156.40 --> 5165.36]  drop like five grand on sharps 32 inch 4k monitor but i think my wife would kill me like absolutely kill me
[5165.36 --> 5174.00]  so um yeah i don't know yet if i can repair the 305t for a reasonable price then i'll do that in all
[5174.00 --> 5179.12]  likelihood just tuned in from england yay hi england uh my main question with the t balancers can it
[5179.12 --> 5184.88]  actually switch the fans off absolutely the fan curves are fully configurable and fully actually work
[5184.88 --> 5189.28]  although i'd recommend using voltage control and i probably wouldn't recommend using pwm fans
[5189.28 --> 5193.68]  have you thought of combining forces with 10 syndicate or do you plan to continue to be
[5193.68 --> 5198.40]  competitors 10 syndicate well logan's on the east coast and we're on the west coast so unless
[5198.40 --> 5204.56]  hard yeah unless one of us was planning to move i don't think we'd be like merging our companies
[5204.56 --> 5209.68]  because he's running his own business now too much the same way that i am um however i really don't see
[5209.68 --> 5215.12]  us as competitors logan's awesome we like yeah we like logan like a lot i mean we've emailed him
[5215.12 --> 5219.36]  we like twitter chatted with him i've never met him in person unfortunately but i'm hoping to at some
[5219.36 --> 5228.48]  point but uh yeah we guys hey go subscribe raise the world with a zero not a no um on youtube tech
[5228.48 --> 5233.60]  syndicate go subscribe because logan's a good guy and his format is so different from ours it's good i
[5233.60 --> 5240.32]  mean i like it we both do benchmarks but his new show is much more structured it's more of a recorded show
[5240.32 --> 5249.60]  whereas our new show is like live q a um subscribing to both channels yeah have that much of a content
[5249.60 --> 5254.08]  style overlap and you would probably if and you'll get a couple different perspectives yeah it's cool
[5254.08 --> 5260.16]  i get mine slicks logan's uh subscribe to paul hardware as well as well as uh awesome sauce news
[5260.16 --> 5269.60]  that's kyle from newegg yeah all good all good guys uh okay let's see 520 watt 80 plus platinum is that the uh
[5269.60 --> 5274.80]  the passive one if so good work melvin because the passive one is cool boss you know what i figured
[5274.80 --> 5281.28]  out i think that one is built on the same platform as the xfx thousand watt platinum that i'm using
[5281.28 --> 5287.92]  yeah yeah you told me about that and the fans on my radiator are air penetrators so they're directed
[5287.92 --> 5293.28]  airflow so if i at least have that one running a little bit i will can have no fan at all in my power
[5293.28 --> 5297.76]  supply because 520 watts is lots for what i'm doing in fact is it 520 or 550
[5299.20 --> 5307.36]  5 520 yeah i can see it it's over there uh how about how is pump rattle in the h100 uh neither of
[5307.36 --> 5314.80]  our h100s is bad yeah i you i owned an ibm model m for a little while and then someone took it back from
[5314.80 --> 5323.28]  me after i cleaned it up how many canadian viewers do you have i don't know four hundred ten thousand
[5324.32 --> 5330.96]  forty two five six first time i watched the stream in real time all right can't pronounce your name
[5330.96 --> 5338.56]  but that's cool is an sli config of 660 non-ti okay you know what probably not a bad idea 660 is not that
[5338.56 --> 5343.92]  far behind the ti and as long as you don't need the extra vram of getting a higher end card with more video
[5343.92 --> 5348.40]  memory you should be able to get a pretty significant performance boost to the tune of
[5349.28 --> 5356.56]  better than you would do by selling a 660 and getting a 670 or something like that um dark gin
[5356.56 --> 5363.12]  it's not nine night classic start i just download classic start i think it's classic shell for windows
[5363.12 --> 5371.04]  8 from the nine night website just want to clarify that uh i'm only 13 i'm not posting strange pictures
[5371.04 --> 5373.68]  yeah i was a perfect angel on the internet when i was 13 too
[5376.00 --> 5381.20]  either way we don't want to risk it because yeah we've clicked on stuff that kind of killed people's
[5381.20 --> 5388.64]  ears before tim already knows the answer nff12 logan likes one of your cest he likes one of our cest
[5388.64 --> 5393.44]  we did we did like 50 what a jerk good enough don't subscribe to logan i take back everything
[5393.44 --> 5398.48]  i said before about subscribing to logan i don't even care i still like logan whatever man okay let's see
[5398.48 --> 5405.60]  if we've got oh evga released their utility for changing the lighting yes 690 and titan so you can
[5406.64 --> 5411.04]  lower the brightness increase the brightness you can set it to breathing breathing mode which is
[5411.04 --> 5416.80]  like i love breathing mode for leds which is awesome although what i think i would probably do if i was
[5416.80 --> 5423.84]  balling enough to have a titan is i would set it up depending on gpu load it can go brighter or dimmer so
[5423.84 --> 5429.20]  cool so cool that's the kind of stuff that really makes me geek out that's awesome i love stuff like
[5429.20 --> 5435.92]  that that's why i like um uh tactical tracers crucial tactical tracers ram i tried to install
[5435.92 --> 5440.64]  the application on my computer it just says unsupported motherboard i haven't done a bios update
[5440.64 --> 5445.60]  though it's still running bios v1 and it's running that weird xeon chipset it's running a workstation
[5445.60 --> 5452.80]  chipset so i might try taking the modules putting them in an x79 or like a z68 board and then moving
[5452.80 --> 5457.20]  the back over because i think it's saved on the modules themselves i think so but i think so i
[5457.20 --> 5463.44]  don't don't quote either of us on that yeah we don't we don't actually know oh there what was i
[5463.44 --> 5468.40]  gonna say yeah and in combination that would have to be pretty cool oh that'd be so cool
[5470.24 --> 5475.12]  i'd probably want to do like an led color swap on the titan though like if they're doing you could
[5475.12 --> 5478.08]  probably do it because you could take the green out of the cooler and probably put in blue i bet it's
[5478.08 --> 5485.92]  not even a colored led looking at that color that's not a green led color that'd be that looks so good
[5485.92 --> 5494.56]  like blue gtx that would be cool uh speaking of like mods and rigs and stuff like that i'm actually
[5494.56 --> 5499.52]  just you should probably not have you sending myself oh yeah guys please don't read my emails
[5500.48 --> 5505.20]  uh i don't think there's anything here that's that bad but you've got stuff from like from people so
[5505.20 --> 5510.00]  their names are there and stuff yeah they might care about that that email from that guy is like
[5510.00 --> 5515.20]  the most bizarre thing that uh that i've seen in a while i don't even see it it's uh they want us to
[5515.20 --> 5522.00]  promote some contest or something to win like a tv or something can we talk about the the i have no
[5522.00 --> 5526.64]  idea what you're talking about i don't know if i can talk about here i'll type it one sec are you drunk
[5526.64 --> 5533.60]  no i just don't know how to describe this sure yeah go for it um i don't even know who it is
[5533.60 --> 5539.12]  it's uh it's uh oh crap you know what let's just save it then because i can't remember who now they're
[5539.12 --> 5545.04]  all gonna be like what uh we'll talk we'll talk about it later okay okay so let's do our featured
[5545.04 --> 5552.24]  build log of the week from the linus tech tips forum so our featured build log is from jorik
[5552.24 --> 5559.36]  wait a minute didn't we already feature this did we uh oh what you're talking about willis did we
[5561.12 --> 5567.04]  you have to log in all right i have to log in to see images uh i can't change that i'm sorry
[5568.16 --> 5574.32]  i think we already featured this one okay well jorik you're on again because it's too late for me to
[5574.32 --> 5587.20]  fix it now um uh uh i had other competitors okay yeah was very rushed today okay i don't remember my
[5587.20 --> 5591.36]  password for the forum right now so we're not at our best right now here guys
[5594.40 --> 5601.68]  there we go i'm logged in was this the first one i think yeah i we definitely featured this
[5601.68 --> 5607.20]  one of those were the completed pictures anyways way to go did you show the wrong pictures when we
[5607.20 --> 5612.88]  actually featured no oh i might not have showed i might not have showed all the pictures okay fine
[5612.88 --> 5617.76]  we'll just we're just gonna feature yorik again go to the very last and we're gonna go to the very
[5617.76 --> 5629.76]  end of his build log okay all right there it goes okay so we're gonna look at his build properly this
[5629.76 --> 5634.56]  time so slick why don't you cover everything that's good about it here you can use this to uh
[5635.12 --> 5641.36]  yeah this was apparently featured before sorry guys this was very last minute we didn't have internet
[5641.36 --> 5647.04]  in the office today that was so fail like and so fail i had to try and find a build log so i was
[5647.04 --> 5652.88]  trying to find build logs without pictures which is like kind of hard to do you just have to go based
[5652.88 --> 5658.08]  on memory of build logs you've seen before that are good so i was i was well i was reading the comments
[5658.08 --> 5663.20]  and trying to figure out what was going on with this one and i was like this sounds awesome so went
[5663.20 --> 5668.72]  with this and that apparently didn't work out too great um tell us about the rig though that looks
[5668.72 --> 5674.80]  awesome it looks amazing it's based on like crop circles that's why it's called phenomenon so kind of
[5674.80 --> 5678.96]  cool cool naming to go along with your style a lot of planning that went into this if you look into
[5678.96 --> 5686.80]  earlier posts like he gets into actually um what uh like i think it's called drafting i don't know if
[5686.80 --> 5692.08]  that's the official name for what he did specifically but he drafted out like what he was going to do
[5692.08 --> 5697.76]  for this crop circle and like the rest of the design of the case um a lot of really really cool mods that
[5697.76 --> 5704.24]  went into this it's very clean like you can even see that picture right there that is incredibly clean
[5704.24 --> 5712.88]  that's outstanding this i never saw so there you go um he uses mnd pc sleeving md md pc oh i'm thinking
[5712.88 --> 5719.76]  million dollar pc um like just insanely clean everything about it is clean but i love the white
[5719.76 --> 5725.28]  fittings yeah i was just gonna say the white fittings are awesome um the the sleeving situation he has
[5725.28 --> 5729.36]  going on is really interesting because a lot of people will go with nice patterns and stuff like one
[5729.36 --> 5735.92]  one one or two two or like half and half but he had a lot of people do like one accent one or one
[5735.92 --> 5740.72]  accent one but he kind of flipped it around a little bit and that's scary because you can flip around a
[5740.72 --> 5744.24]  little bit and it might not look very good and then you just sleeved everything it doesn't look very
[5744.24 --> 5754.80]  good but this looks really good we have a visitor hi oh no okay well live stream's over guys my cats are
[5754.80 --> 5761.84]  apparently outside so i need to go chase them they are uh they're indoor cats because they're expensive
[5761.84 --> 5767.44]  and i don't want them to get stolen and they're stupid and i don't want them to get dead so um thank
