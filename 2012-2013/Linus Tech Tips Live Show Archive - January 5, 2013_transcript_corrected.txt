[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 62.12] I work.
[62.12 → 63.08] We have light.
[63.44 → 63.98] Are we good?
[64.36 → 64.96] Does it work?
[66.20 → 66.76] Okay.
[66.92 → 67.58] It's all good.
[68.50 → 74.32] So, I don't know what's going on with this camera.
[74.32 → 86.40] But I'm like super not impressed right now because we were doing, if you saw that unboxing
[86.40 → 92.32] we did of the Kraken X40 where we were doing a dual cam setup, we were using XSplit to record
[92.32 → 102.98] both camera angles, and we were trying to capture audio to the FS or through the FS, and it wasn't
[102.98 → 103.52] working.
[103.88 → 106.82] It was popping and doing a lot of crazy sounds and stuff.
[106.98 → 110.26] Yeah, but it wasn't, I don't think it was as bad as what...
[110.26 → 110.46] Yeah.
[110.60 → 115.30] Well, I think it's the problems that there was already plus the fact of like putting
[115.30 → 120.54] it through XSplit which is like barely working and then streaming it online to all these people.
[120.88 → 123.94] Like the combination of all those things probably just made it so much worse.
[123.94 → 128.56] But basically that puts me in a position where I'm kind of sitting here going, well how's
[128.56 → 129.38] this supposed to work?
[129.42 → 131.96] Because I can record audio just fine to SD on this guy.
[132.76 → 136.78] But something about outputting to HDMI suddenly doesn't work.
[136.90 → 143.92] Guys, this is the exact setup that we were using for live streams in the past, and we didn't
[143.92 → 147.82] change anything and yeah.
[148.14 → 152.76] So, I mean we're sorry, but I don't know what else to tell you because tonight we sat down
[152.76 → 160.02] to prep for the live stream an hour ago, and we should have been just ready to go and everything
[160.02 → 161.14] should have just been fine.
[161.62 → 167.02] But we've got about, I don't know what, half a dozen blue screens on the editing computer
[167.02 → 172.06] that ended up, irony of ironies, being caused by our Aver media Live Gamer HD.
[172.34 → 173.86] Which is usually totally solid.
[174.18 → 179.76] Compared to the Black magic cards which usually crash and cause all kinds of random horrible
[179.76 → 180.32] problems.
[180.32 → 187.28] But I think it might be because we were using the bottom PCIe 4X slot on the Z77 board which
[187.28 → 191.90] is routed through the chipset rather than being routed directly to the CPU.
[193.22 → 193.50] So.
[196.92 → 197.48] Yeah.
[198.00 → 198.68] That sucked.
[199.06 → 199.32] Yeah.
[199.32 → 206.04] One other thing, as I've seen a couple of times posted in the Twitch chat, as you may have
[206.04 → 208.50] heard, the forum is kind of alive.
[209.12 → 212.20] It's down right now because of physical server relocation.
[212.64 → 218.64] Meaning DNS servers that are everywhere had to repopulate and re-figure out where my server
[218.64 → 219.98] is so that you guys can go to the forum.
[219.98 → 226.94] Good news is, everything will be exactly how it was the minute before I brought the server
[226.94 → 227.94] down.
[227.94 → 230.94] So you're not going to lose your posts, you're not going to lose your accounts, you're not
[230.94 → 232.78] going to lose whatever you had.
[232.78 → 238.94] It's just going to be down until something somewhere decides that everyone can now see the forum.
[238.94 → 242.40] And we're really thrilled with how much traction there's been on the forum already.
[242.56 → 244.22] I mean, you guys have been amazing.
[244.34 → 249.04] And I don't think even that many of you know about it yet.
[251.48 → 251.92] Yeah.
[252.12 → 254.66] I mean, do any of you guys know yet?
[256.06 → 257.08] There are a few people.
[257.20 → 259.28] One guy's saying, what is the IP screw waiting for the DNS?
[259.28 → 260.68] I can't do that.
[262.12 → 268.64] Because the HT access file in my Apache folder is pointing certain things in certain places
[268.64 → 269.76] based off of the URL name.
[270.22 → 277.44] So if you go to the IP address, it's just like an FTP site, basically.
[277.70 → 279.04] So that's not really going to help you very much.
[280.42 → 284.16] Medium, my buddy, and I have been spending incredible amounts of time.
[284.38 → 285.34] Huge thanks to him.
[285.38 → 288.60] He's done tons of things that I have no idea what he's doing.
[288.72 → 289.56] It's all voodoo magic.
[289.78 → 294.88] He's a huge part of the reason, pretty much the reason why the forum was up at all.
[295.16 → 296.34] So thanks, Medium.
[296.34 → 302.32] But we've been slaving away making Bulletin 5 work at all.
[302.84 → 303.44] It's incredible.
[303.60 → 307.26] We are the only site that I know of that's actually a production website,
[307.40 → 309.96] not like an example website hosted by Bulletin,
[310.20 → 311.88] that's actually running this software.
[312.74 → 315.14] And there are a lot of things that are broken, like editing posts,
[315.32 → 316.72] as a lot of you have probably already noticed.
[316.88 → 317.62] It just doesn't work.
[317.98 → 321.18] Like you can edit the posts, but when it goes to the edit screen,
[321.26 → 322.14] your post isn't there.
[322.14 → 325.66] So it's kind of weird.
[325.80 → 328.08] There's a lot of stuff that's broken like that we can't fix,
[328.38 → 329.78] because that's based on Bulletin.
[330.42 → 332.54] There's a lot of stuff that's going around that we can fix
[332.54 → 334.40] that is kind of messed up that Bulletin has.
[334.66 → 335.90] Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[336.24 → 336.60] Got it.
[336.92 → 337.56] Okay, go ahead.
[338.82 → 339.86] I'm just worried for a sec.
[339.86 → 343.02] Like different sizes for attachments and stuff.
[343.28 → 346.50] The defaults for that are very weird and not what they actually say.
[346.76 → 349.72] When it tells you like, oh, it has to be these dimensions at this size,
[349.84 → 351.84] it's not actually those dimensions of that size.
[352.00 → 356.92] So we are looking into problems that we can fix.
[356.92 → 362.72] And hopefully Bulletin beta 24 is, as AXIOM would say,
[362.80 → 365.88] the holy grail of beta releases.
[366.38 → 367.52] And hopefully it fixes everything.
[367.66 → 370.26] But other than that, the form's working pretty okay.
[370.46 → 372.40] The main problem we actually had was speed,
[372.56 → 374.20] which is the reason why we did the relocation.
[374.28 → 377.86] And we pulled it from here, where it was running on a line
[377.86 → 380.06] that was five megabits per second up.
[381.40 → 381.88] Megabit.
[382.04 → 382.50] Megabit.
[382.82 → 383.66] Is that what I said?
[383.68 → 385.06] I think you said megabytes per second.
[385.06 → 386.30] I meant to say megabits per second.
[386.92 → 389.34] To a line at NCI head office,
[389.90 → 392.60] which I was hoping was going to be 40 megabits per second up,
[392.76 → 395.44] but is actually, now that we got there, 25.
[395.78 → 399.46] But that's still incredibly faster from what we have right now.
[399.64 → 402.90] And we'll hopefully get above the bottleneck
[402.90 → 403.96] that we're currently sitting on.
[404.20 → 406.66] To be clear, guys, this isn't an NCI forum.
[406.82 → 409.04] This is a Linus Tech Tips dedicated forum.
[409.40 → 413.90] They're just sponsoring us the bandwidth increase that we need for now.
[413.90 → 418.12] We're hoping to move either to an off-site host somewhere
[418.12 → 422.98] or get some kind of baller internet connection here,
[423.18 → 425.58] which may actually be an option.
[425.74 → 428.20] I mean, we can pick ourselves up a load balancing router
[428.20 → 430.54] for about $150.
[430.54 → 433.92] And then Shaw has a new service they're rolling out here
[433.92 → 435.94] that's going to be 15 megabits up.
[436.10 → 437.42] We can pull two lines in.
[438.26 → 442.22] So we might be able to do 25 to 30 megabits per second up from here,
[442.38 → 443.10] which would be...
[443.10 → 444.00] That would be really cool.
[444.08 → 445.08] Sort of edentulous.
[445.08 → 447.00] I would like to have the server on site.
[447.14 → 448.12] We're hardware guys,
[448.26 → 450.88] so it's cool to be able to actually manage the server here.
[451.38 → 451.52] Yeah.
[452.24 → 453.94] But you had to do some ka jiggering
[453.94 → 455.90] to be able to manage it off-site.
[456.68 → 459.08] Actually, you should tell them about the config you have going right now.
[460.28 → 461.48] It's kind of ridiculous.
[461.80 → 463.36] So there are two servers right now.
[463.46 → 464.56] There are two servers right now.
[464.64 → 465.28] One of them is Windows.
[465.46 → 466.08] One of them is Linux.
[466.44 → 468.80] We're trying to move everything over to the Linux box,
[468.80 → 473.44] but then we couldn't properly SSH into the Linux box.
[473.76 → 474.08] So, oh.
[474.58 → 477.70] Medium and I spent ridiculous amounts of time today
[477.70 → 479.68] just trying to make it so that we could actually connect
[479.68 → 481.68] to the boxes on NCX's network
[481.68 → 485.04] because they have us behind layers of networking.
[485.64 → 488.54] So it's kind of odd trying to control things
[488.54 → 490.68] when I have no control over the routers or the switches.
[491.42 → 494.42] So I'm just calling up the networking guy every once in a while.
[494.50 → 494.84] I'll be like,
[494.92 → 497.34] hey, I need this kind of changed.
[498.80 → 500.54] So that was a very interesting suggestion.
[500.86 → 501.94] Hey, it's me again.
[502.76 → 504.36] Hey, can you please do this?
[504.62 → 505.06] Please.
[505.74 → 506.90] I need access.
[507.10 → 507.30] Please.
[507.92 → 510.06] And everything ended up being kind of ghetto-rigged
[510.06 → 511.10] but is working.
[511.80 → 512.62] And, yeah.
[513.40 → 514.40] Well, we're at CES.
[515.92 → 518.20] I've got one super moderator set up
[518.20 → 520.46] and I've got a few moderators set up.
[521.02 → 523.20] Everyone's kind of on a trial basis right now.
[524.04 → 526.54] So watch those moderators.
[526.76 → 527.82] Let me know what you think of them.
[527.82 → 529.14] Make sure they're all doing fair play.
[530.62 → 531.54] I think they're all really...
[531.54 → 532.82] They seem like perfect guys.
[532.96 → 534.20] I like the moderators so far.
[534.32 → 535.22] But we need to make sure
[535.22 → 536.66] that they're all actually perfect guys.
[536.96 → 538.00] So pay attention to them.
[538.20 → 539.88] But the only admin that's going to be running online,
[539.96 → 541.22] so the only guy that's going to be, like,
[541.68 → 543.12] controlling the back end of the site
[543.12 → 544.04] while we're at CES
[544.04 → 544.94] is going to be Region.
[545.88 → 547.96] So good luck to you.
[547.96 → 548.24] Yeah.
[549.28 → 550.06] Thanks, man.
[550.28 → 551.64] We appreciate it.
[554.14 → 555.26] What if it goes down?
[555.26 → 557.94] If it, like, actually...
[557.94 → 559.50] If the computer powers down
[559.50 → 561.88] and doesn't, like, turn back on,
[561.92 → 562.86] so, like, if it doesn't restart
[562.86 → 563.76] or anything like that,
[564.12 → 565.12] and we're at CES,
[565.88 → 566.86] we're kind of screwed.
[567.24 → 567.52] Okay.
[567.92 → 569.98] Because it's sitting in a room that...
[569.98 → 572.10] So, basically, don't DDoS us
[572.10 → 573.36] is what we're trying to say.
[573.44 → 574.52] That would be greatly appreciated.
[574.54 → 575.64] Like, don't, like,
[576.16 → 578.06] don't go to the NCI head office
[578.06 → 579.74] and cut the power lines.
[580.72 → 582.24] I mean, you shouldn't do that anyway.
[582.82 → 584.32] These are things I shouldn't have to say.
[585.00 → 586.88] So far, everybody on the forum
[586.88 → 587.82] and everybody on Twitter
[587.82 → 589.08] and everything has been super helpful.
[589.28 → 590.42] That's really nice.
[590.76 → 592.04] Reporting problems is great.
[592.62 → 593.86] Reporting stuff, like, it's slow.
[594.30 → 596.66] Like, that's good that you told me, but...
[596.66 → 597.08] We know.
[597.48 → 598.42] We know it's slow.
[598.54 → 600.44] Part of it is the 5 megabit connection
[600.44 → 601.04] we've been on.
[601.14 → 602.20] Part of it is the fact that
[602.20 → 603.96] bulletin 5 is just kind of a dog.
[604.20 → 604.38] Yeah.
[604.58 → 606.54] When we browse on it locally,
[607.24 → 608.80] there's still that delay.
[609.06 → 610.48] Like, when you click on a thread,
[610.74 → 612.18] the page populates,
[612.36 → 613.44] and then there's, like,
[613.58 → 615.70] one, two, three steamboats
[615.70 → 617.50] before you can actually click on something.
[619.04 → 620.36] We can't stress enough,
[620.36 → 621.76] the back end for the forum,
[621.88 → 622.62] bulletin 5,
[622.70 → 625.40] is still in a pretty brutal stage of beta.
[625.40 → 628.26] Um, so there's a lot of stuff
[628.26 → 630.22] that we can't control.
[630.48 → 632.22] One of the members of the bulletin community
[632.22 → 633.24] was calling it,
[633.30 → 635.72] was calling it some kind of travesty
[635.72 → 637.08] that they're even calling this a beta.
[637.26 → 638.04] Yeah, and he's, like,
[638.06 → 639.08] a pretty esteemed member
[639.08 → 640.04] of the bulletin community.
[640.38 → 641.92] Max possible reputation points,
[642.06 → 642.96] 30,000 posts,
[643.20 → 644.96] like, huge guy,
[645.02 → 645.94] and he's raging about it.
[645.94 → 647.12] He's like, this is an alpha.
[647.34 → 648.30] This is not a beta.
[648.54 → 650.16] Yeah, and we're running it on production.
[650.82 → 651.26] Yeah.
[652.06 → 653.20] So hang with us.
[653.32 → 654.12] Things will be fixed.
[654.30 → 655.38] Some of it's out of our control.
[655.88 → 658.02] And I'm going as fast as I can with AXIOM
[658.02 → 660.06] to fix everything else that is within our control.
[660.44 → 660.88] All right.
[660.96 → 662.08] So why don't we, uh,
[662.08 → 663.22] let's do some Twitter, shall we?
[663.54 → 664.34] Oh, okay.
[664.44 → 665.44] The angle's a little funny.
[665.74 → 667.24] We actually don't have the...
[667.80 → 669.08] Is this going to cause problems?
[669.34 → 670.90] We don't have a mount for the camera,
[671.02 → 672.24] so it's sitting on a cardboard sheet
[672.80 → 674.42] on top of the actual tripod.
[674.42 → 674.86] Yeah.
[674.86 → 677.54] I don't have the tools handy
[677.54 → 679.44] to remove the stupid mounting plate
[679.44 → 680.06] from the FS,
[680.52 → 682.86] and we're trying to get this back up
[682.86 → 684.38] as soon as we possibly could,
[684.54 → 686.04] so it's okay.
[686.14 → 687.14] It's just not worth it.
[687.14 → 687.76] You can use a quarter.
[687.92 → 689.46] I don't have a quarter on me.
[690.50 → 691.18] Calm down.
[691.18 → 692.54] All right.
[692.58 → 693.82] So let's do some Q&A.
[694.02 → 696.32] What's a good mechanical keyboard under 70 bucks?
[696.78 → 697.02] Sorry.
[697.02 → 697.30] Quick fires.
[698.40 → 700.12] They're not under 70 bucks.
[700.24 → 701.60] You can find them sometimes.
[702.00 → 702.78] 69.99.
[703.16 → 704.48] I think I've seen a Quick fire,
[704.90 → 705.94] like the 10 keyless ones,
[706.12 → 706.86] 69.99.
[707.04 → 707.82] Okay, there you go.
[707.94 → 710.08] If you can find it possibly somewhere ever.
[710.24 → 711.68] Yeah, possibly somewhere ever.
[711.88 → 713.34] I mean, asking for a mechanical keyboard
[713.34 → 714.80] under 70 bucks is me being like,
[715.20 → 716.42] hey, where can I get a good,
[716.62 → 718.36] like, Uber gaming graphics card
[718.36 → 719.52] for under 150 bucks?
[720.46 → 721.56] It's like, well, sorry.
[721.68 → 723.16] It just doesn't work that way.
[723.78 → 725.10] My jacket is ugly.
[729.18 → 730.02] Matt asks,
[730.10 → 732.04] my CPU is an FX4100.
[732.36 → 734.60] It doesn't perform well in CPU-heavy games.
[734.60 → 736.96] Will upgrading to an i5-3570K
[736.96 → 738.26] show me a noticeable difference?
[738.48 → 740.42] The answer is yes.
[741.40 → 743.00] Especially once you're overclocking.
[743.08 → 746.76] A 3570K will destroy an FX4100.
[748.02 → 749.90] FX4100 is basically,
[750.04 → 751.68] okay, think of it this way, guys.
[752.66 → 755.82] Phenom 1 didn't actually really improve anything
[755.82 → 757.28] over previous,
[758.50 → 760.88] I mean, what branding did they even use?
[760.96 → 762.16] Athlon 64, I think,
[762.26 → 763.12] was what they used before that.
[763.12 → 766.46] Phenom 2 improved very little over Phenom 1.
[766.56 → 767.48] It was like an incremental,
[767.86 → 769.34] like, like, like a talk.
[770.02 → 773.96] And then FX didn't really improve anything
[773.96 → 774.82] over Phenom 2.
[775.32 → 777.64] And then that's where you're at.
[777.70 → 779.62] So you're basically running an Athlon 64,
[780.04 → 783.38] whereas Intel has been marching along
[783.38 → 784.80] in terms of CPU performance.
[784.80 → 787.40] 3570K will just destroy a 4100.
[790.34 → 791.26] Editing posts.
[791.36 → 793.44] That comes in the next beta of V Bulletin, right?
[794.24 → 796.44] Supposedly, but it was also in previous betas.
[798.94 → 799.06] So...
[799.06 → 801.00] This is what I was talking about,
[801.00 → 802.42] about brutal beta stage,
[802.84 → 805.50] is, like, features that used to be in it
[805.50 → 806.54] are not in it,
[806.66 → 808.70] and features that weren't in it before are in it.
[808.78 → 811.10] Like, it's very much a beta.
[811.46 → 813.22] And then our version of it,
[813.50 → 814.80] like, what we've changed and stuff
[814.80 → 815.74] is still also in beta.
[815.88 → 816.92] So you're basically running
[816.92 → 819.04] the beta stage of a beta
[819.04 → 821.18] is what your forum is.
[821.84 → 822.36] So...
[822.36 → 822.76] Yay!
[823.08 → 824.10] It's hobbling along.
[824.24 → 825.10] We're doing good, but...
[825.10 → 825.22] Yeah.
[825.36 → 825.70] Yeah.
[826.56 → 827.92] Thoughts on PC 360?
[828.22 → 830.20] I've heard it's a easier version of the 350.
[830.80 → 832.08] I'm not a big 350 fan.
[832.94 → 833.20] Okay.
[833.34 → 834.76] So it's probably better than the 350.
[835.54 → 836.50] I'd buy a 7H, personally.
[836.50 → 838.72] I like them a lot more than the 350s.
[839.30 → 840.30] Have you tried the 360?
[840.38 → 841.00] I've never tried them.
[841.54 → 842.18] Harrison's got some.
[842.64 → 843.20] Oh, okay.
[843.54 → 844.62] Yeah, they're, like, actually...
[844.62 → 845.34] I like them quite a bit.
[845.50 → 845.72] Okay.
[845.78 → 846.74] For a headset,
[847.00 → 848.60] I'm not usually way into headsets.
[848.82 → 849.06] Right.
[849.06 → 850.62] I like headphones with a mic,
[850.94 → 851.64] but for a headset,
[851.88 → 852.48] they're pretty awesome.
[853.42 → 853.68] Yeah.
[853.90 → 854.34] They're perfect.
[854.56 → 856.78] I built my first computer today.
[856.90 → 857.84] How come you never told me
[857.84 → 859.54] the back of the motherboard was Pokey?
[860.50 → 860.90] Um,
[861.08 → 862.46] I didn't think of it.
[868.28 → 869.22] You know what?
[869.64 → 870.08] Guys,
[870.18 → 871.56] when you're building your first computer,
[871.72 → 873.12] be careful of the metal
[873.12 → 874.60] on the outside of the power supply.
[874.78 → 875.60] It can be cold.
[878.36 → 879.32] We're teasing you,
[879.40 → 880.40] but it's all good.
[880.48 → 880.94] It's all good.
[881.12 → 881.78] You did good.
[881.78 → 883.22] Good work building your first computer.
[883.56 → 885.36] Feel free to post a picture of it on Facebook.
[885.36 → 886.04] Post a picture
[886.04 → 887.24] and post the specs.
[887.38 → 888.38] And when the forum's up,
[888.52 → 890.12] go to the new build section
[890.12 → 892.44] and post your build.
[892.56 → 893.12] Post your build,
[893.18 → 893.80] because that's awesome.
[894.00 → 894.20] Yeah.
[894.54 → 895.96] Have you ever built a Hackintosh?
[895.96 → 899.64] That project is kind of ready to go.
[899.64 → 899.92] Like,
[899.96 → 901.26] I have the installer files
[901.26 → 902.84] on my USB drive
[902.84 → 905.04] that I'm ready to install
[905.04 → 906.02] on the motherboard
[906.02 → 906.68] that we brought
[906.68 → 908.92] back to the lab today.
[909.42 → 909.86] So,
[910.02 → 910.88] hopefully soon,
[910.98 → 912.52] but not before we go to CES.
[912.62 → 913.94] CES is going to be like,
[914.84 → 915.30] aw.
[916.86 → 917.32] Ridiculous.
[917.42 → 918.12] All of our time
[918.12 → 919.24] before CES
[919.24 → 920.02] was kind of devoted
[920.02 → 921.54] to like finishing off projects
[921.54 → 922.32] and me starting
[922.32 → 923.50] and hopefully finishing,
[923.50 → 924.44] but that didn't happen
[924.44 → 925.02] the forum.
[926.22 → 926.94] Might still happen.
[927.64 → 928.56] It's not going to be finished.
[928.70 → 928.88] Well,
[928.98 → 929.90] it's never finished.
[933.90 → 934.90] Touché, sir.
[936.40 → 936.80] Yeah,
[936.96 → 937.40] but it's,
[937.90 → 938.94] I hope the forum
[938.94 → 939.82] comes to life soon.
[940.10 → 940.98] I'm getting kind of worried.
[940.98 → 941.66] Um,
[942.86 → 943.30] what was I,
[943.36 → 944.14] where was I going with this?
[944.26 → 945.48] CES is bad
[945.48 → 946.46] and we won't finish anything
[946.46 → 947.18] before that really.
[947.18 → 947.44] No,
[947.58 → 948.40] and then even when we get,
[948.56 → 949.74] get back from CES
[949.74 → 950.66] for the first day or two,
[950.72 → 951.38] we're probably going to be
[951.38 → 952.92] just like managing stuff
[952.92 → 954.00] that we didn't get to release
[954.00 → 954.86] while we're at CES.
[955.00 → 956.70] We'll probably be sleeping
[956.70 → 958.42] because we'll probably be sick.
[958.54 → 959.36] I don't sleep.
[959.76 → 960.52] Every year,
[960.64 → 962.48] I get like just super sick.
[962.58 → 962.76] Right,
[962.78 → 963.18] because there's like
[963.18 → 963.94] a million people there.
[963.96 → 964.80] Because you don't sleep,
[964.98 → 966.12] there's a million people there
[966.12 → 967.44] from all corners of the world
[967.44 → 968.14] where they've got
[968.14 → 969.66] all kinds of weird diseases
[969.66 → 970.86] that I've never been exposed
[970.86 → 971.22] to.
[972.26 → 973.12] I was going to say
[973.12 → 973.98] I've made it through PAX
[973.98 → 974.38] every year,
[974.46 → 975.84] but PAX is a weekend,
[976.70 → 977.96] not an entire week.
[978.44 → 979.22] So this will be,
[979.28 → 980.10] this will be a new challenge.
[980.22 → 980.42] Oh yeah,
[980.56 → 981.80] CES is a haul.
[981.96 → 982.06] See,
[982.22 → 983.36] Slick's never been to CES.
[983.48 → 984.36] This will be my fourth
[984.36 → 985.24] or fifth year now.
[985.96 → 986.46] And it's,
[986.68 → 987.12] it is,
[987.32 → 987.68] it is,
[987.78 → 988.98] people think it looks fun,
[989.10 → 989.96] but it's not fun.
[990.62 → 990.90] Linus,
[990.98 → 992.52] will LIPS make a huge difference
[992.52 → 993.32] from a TN panel?
[993.40 → 994.22] The answer is yes.
[995.38 → 996.54] Forum must be up
[996.54 → 997.42] because it's down.
[997.50 → 998.28] It won't load for me
[998.28 → 999.02] too much traffic.
[999.82 → 1000.12] No,
[1000.12 → 1000.34] no,
[1000.34 → 1001.30] it's definitely down.
[1001.98 → 1002.84] It's down,
[1002.94 → 1004.56] like not because of too much traffic
[1004.56 → 1005.42] or it being broken.
[1005.82 → 1007.70] We physically moved the server.
[1007.90 → 1008.92] Like that's what we were doing
[1008.92 → 1009.36] this morning
[1009.36 → 1010.68] when you ran out of gas.
[1013.02 → 1014.88] It just hasn't been a good day
[1014.88 → 1015.80] in general,
[1015.94 → 1016.32] actually.
[1016.32 → 1016.84] not really.
[1016.84 → 1018.78] Like the tech tips episodes,
[1019.00 → 1020.42] the NCI tech tips episodes
[1020.42 → 1021.28] we filmed at,
[1021.28 → 1023.18] at NCI HQ today.
[1023.38 → 1025.56] One of them was like a build guide
[1025.56 → 1027.38] in an MATE machine
[1027.38 → 1029.16] that's actually within
[1029.16 → 1030.58] Silverstone's classification
[1030.58 → 1032.08] of small form factor.
[1032.32 → 1036.30] So this MATE tower system
[1036.30 → 1039.00] is actually not much taller
[1039.00 → 1040.28] than an MATE board.
[1040.60 → 1041.70] Like it's about this tall.
[1041.70 → 1042.26] Yeah,
[1042.26 → 1042.74] go get it,
[1042.78 → 1043.12] go get it.
[1043.12 → 1043.68] We'll show it to them.
[1043.74 → 1044.94] I'll explain it in the meantime.
[1045.52 → 1046.64] So it's not much taller
[1046.64 → 1047.84] than an MATE board.
[1048.18 → 1051.40] We put dual GTX 680s in it.
[1051.58 → 1053.64] We put a thousand watt power supply.
[1054.16 → 1054.72] We put,
[1054.92 → 1056.68] I think we changed it.
[1056.78 → 1056.98] Is it,
[1057.08 → 1057.74] do you have it already?
[1057.92 → 1058.08] Oh,
[1058.14 → 1058.54] here we go.
[1059.10 → 1059.66] All right.
[1059.76 → 1061.58] So it's in the Hugo carrying case
[1061.58 → 1064.18] and holy crap.
[1064.46 → 1066.98] This is one of the most difficult machines
[1066.98 → 1067.92] I've ever built.
[1068.06 → 1069.34] In spite of the fact
[1069.34 → 1071.54] that I did a full build guide on it.
[1072.54 → 1073.26] There we go.
[1073.56 → 1074.40] In spite of the fact
[1074.40 → 1075.76] that I did a full build guide on it
[1075.76 → 1076.60] at the end of the video,
[1076.82 → 1078.56] I had no choice,
[1078.66 → 1079.06] but to say,
[1079.12 → 1079.62] look guys,
[1079.68 → 1081.20] I don't recommend this
[1081.20 → 1082.26] for novice builders.
[1082.36 → 1083.02] So check this out.
[1083.20 → 1084.60] It's not actually much bigger
[1084.60 → 1085.16] than a shuttle.
[1085.34 → 1086.42] It's about the same length
[1086.42 → 1086.86] as a shuttle
[1086.86 → 1088.16] and it's about this much taller
[1088.16 → 1089.10] than a shuttle.
[1089.40 → 1091.48] It's got a 120 millimetre intake
[1091.48 → 1091.94] in the front.
[1092.04 → 1093.10] This is in the SG09.
[1093.94 → 1094.12] Okay.
[1094.54 → 1095.26] It's got,
[1095.90 → 1096.16] okay,
[1096.24 → 1097.30] one of the video cards
[1097.30 → 1097.88] is out now,
[1097.98 → 1099.72] but it had dual 680s in it.
[1100.00 → 1100.20] See,
[1100.26 → 1100.82] like I said,
[1101.02 → 1101.86] the MATE board
[1101.86 → 1102.74] goes from here
[1102.74 → 1103.76] to here.
[1104.12 → 1104.48] So it's,
[1104.60 → 1104.74] that,
[1104.82 → 1105.78] that gives you some idea
[1105.78 → 1106.68] of the scale here.
[1106.90 → 1108.52] This is a 120 mid fan,
[1108.78 → 1109.62] not a 140.
[1110.02 → 1110.88] And I'm going to see
[1110.88 → 1112.06] if I can get this,
[1112.06 → 1113.66] this top panel off.
[1113.82 → 1115.34] So entertain them
[1115.34 → 1116.36] with talk about
[1116.36 → 1117.06] what we're doing
[1117.06 → 1117.56] at CES.
[1118.06 → 1119.14] What are we going to do there?
[1119.70 → 1120.26] I'm going to have
[1120.26 → 1120.86] lots of meetings.
[1122.12 → 1123.12] We've been so busy
[1123.12 → 1123.78] with other stuff,
[1124.32 → 1125.32] we haven't even discussed
[1125.32 → 1126.16] what we're going to be doing
[1126.16 → 1127.08] at CES that much.
[1127.54 → 1129.36] So I almost don't even know.
[1129.36 → 1134.12] I know we're going to be spending
[1134.12 → 1135.04] not as much time
[1135.04 → 1135.58] as I expected
[1135.58 → 1136.32] on the show floor
[1136.32 → 1137.54] because we have
[1137.54 → 1138.92] a lot of different suites
[1138.92 → 1139.42] to go do
[1139.42 → 1140.22] within the hotels,
[1140.58 → 1141.52] which will be like
[1141.52 → 1142.70] a different vendor
[1142.70 → 1145.34] will have like a suite
[1145.34 → 1146.32] where they'll show off
[1146.32 → 1147.26] specific parts
[1147.26 → 1147.92] because the show floor
[1147.92 → 1148.54] isn't big enough
[1148.54 → 1149.46] and not personal enough.
[1149.82 → 1150.04] Well,
[1150.12 → 1151.18] that and the show floor
[1151.18 → 1152.40] is extremely expensive
[1152.40 → 1153.20] and I don't think
[1153.20 → 1153.74] a lot of guys
[1153.74 → 1154.34] see the point.
[1154.74 → 1154.98] Yeah,
[1155.10 → 1155.82] if they can just
[1155.82 → 1156.36] hold a suite
[1156.36 → 1157.30] and then get in contact
[1157.30 → 1158.06] with the exact people
[1158.06 → 1158.98] they want to anyway,
[1159.08 → 1159.50] it's not really
[1159.50 → 1160.50] necessarily worth it for them.
[1161.78 → 1162.22] So,
[1162.62 → 1162.88] yeah,
[1163.00 → 1163.94] the plan is
[1163.94 → 1165.06] we've got
[1165.06 → 1165.92] a pretty epic
[1165.92 → 1167.54] internet connection,
[1167.66 → 1167.94] hopefully.
[1168.36 → 1169.28] So we'll be hopefully
[1169.28 → 1171.00] shooting out videos
[1171.00 → 1172.20] actively while we're there.
[1172.42 → 1172.78] Yeah.
[1172.88 → 1173.34] We've noticed
[1173.34 → 1174.22] one big problem
[1174.22 → 1175.30] with reviewers
[1175.30 → 1176.48] that go down to the CES
[1176.48 → 1177.02] is that they don't
[1177.02 → 1177.82] release their stuff
[1177.82 → 1179.86] until like way after
[1179.86 → 1180.52] and then it's usually
[1180.52 → 1181.24] pretty lacklustre.
[1181.78 → 1183.16] So our plan
[1183.16 → 1184.92] is to be uploading it
[1184.92 → 1186.22] as fast as we can
[1186.22 → 1186.86] every single night.
[1187.32 → 1187.60] Okay,
[1187.70 → 1188.16] check this out.
[1188.22 → 1188.38] Sorry,
[1188.48 → 1189.00] stage two
[1189.00 → 1189.68] of showing you guys
[1189.68 → 1190.20] this machine.
[1190.48 → 1191.18] So this case
[1191.18 → 1192.76] holds two 3.5 inch
[1192.76 → 1193.28] hard drives
[1193.28 → 1193.88] here and here.
[1194.12 → 1195.52] We have two SSDs
[1195.52 → 1196.70] in RAID 0 down there.
[1196.78 → 1197.82] That's two M4s
[1197.82 → 1198.26] right there.
[1198.56 → 1199.26] You can put another
[1199.26 → 1200.30] two SSDs here
[1200.30 → 1200.84] if you want.
[1201.56 → 1202.78] Slimline optical drive
[1202.78 → 1203.34] in the top.
[1203.86 → 1204.12] Okay,
[1204.26 → 1205.34] see that tower cooler
[1205.34 → 1205.74] in there?
[1206.40 → 1207.04] This thing
[1207.04 → 1208.24] is full
[1208.24 → 1209.36] of stuff.
[1209.80 → 1210.54] Plugging in,
[1211.00 → 1211.24] ugh,
[1211.40 → 1211.60] see,
[1211.74 → 1212.52] I didn't look
[1212.52 → 1213.66] closely at the
[1213.66 → 1214.60] instructions
[1214.60 → 1215.48] Silverstone includes
[1215.48 → 1215.92] for this case.
[1215.92 → 1216.70] RTM,
[1216.90 → 1217.16] guys,
[1217.32 → 1217.88] RTM.
[1218.70 → 1219.00] Because,
[1220.08 → 1220.22] and,
[1220.34 → 1220.80] okay,
[1220.88 → 1221.54] they also made
[1221.54 → 1222.22] a slight mistake
[1222.22 → 1223.00] because they show
[1223.00 → 1223.54] when you install
[1223.54 → 1223.96] the motherboard,
[1224.12 → 1224.76] they show the CPU
[1224.76 → 1225.56] heat sink installed
[1225.56 → 1225.92] on it.
[1226.24 → 1226.94] That's wrong.
[1227.44 → 1227.88] That sounds like
[1227.88 → 1228.28] a turbo.
[1228.44 → 1229.34] You have to install
[1229.34 → 1229.98] the motherboard,
[1230.36 → 1231.40] install the 4-pin,
[1231.66 → 1232.38] and then put the
[1232.38 → 1232.90] heat sink on.
[1232.98 → 1233.52] But I was thinking
[1233.52 → 1234.36] maybe I could put it
[1234.36 → 1235.20] on before it settled
[1235.20 → 1235.78] in or something
[1235.78 → 1236.14] like that.
[1236.32 → 1236.64] So anyway,
[1236.72 → 1237.58] I had a really hard
[1237.58 → 1238.54] time plugging the 4-pin
[1238.54 → 1238.68] in.
[1238.76 → 1239.28] I ended up having
[1239.28 → 1240.14] to take the heat sink
[1240.14 → 1240.84] off again
[1240.84 → 1242.08] to plug it in
[1242.08 → 1243.42] and then I realized,
[1243.52 → 1243.64] oh,
[1243.70 → 1244.44] I forgot to plug in
[1244.44 → 1246.12] the CPU fan header.
[1248.34 → 1249.22] Not cool.
[1249.44 → 1250.62] Not cool at all.
[1251.00 → 1251.66] But here,
[1251.72 → 1252.34] I want to give you guys
[1252.34 → 1253.28] a closer look at this.
[1253.36 → 1253.96] I think it's on
[1253.96 → 1254.52] autofocus,
[1254.60 → 1255.20] so you should be able
[1255.20 → 1255.50] to see.
[1255.86 → 1257.02] So there's a Silverstone
[1257.02 → 1259.04] dual tower heat pipe
[1259.04 → 1259.32] cooler.
[1259.48 → 1260.42] There's some high profile
[1260.42 → 1260.96] memory in there.
[1261.02 → 1261.74] This is a really cool
[1261.74 → 1263.16] cooler because it has
[1263.16 → 1264.58] one thick side
[1264.58 → 1265.96] and one thin side
[1265.96 → 1266.54] so that you have
[1266.54 → 1267.20] enough room
[1267.20 → 1268.42] for all your memory
[1268.42 → 1268.84] slots.
[1269.44 → 1269.94] Good idea,
[1270.04 → 1270.14] hey?
[1270.34 → 1271.32] There's the power supply
[1271.32 → 1272.06] right at the front
[1272.06 → 1273.04] there with a pass
[1273.04 → 1275.50] through to a cord
[1275.50 → 1276.14] at the back.
[1276.46 → 1277.22] See right there?
[1277.66 → 1278.24] That's where that
[1278.24 → 1278.76] plugs in.
[1279.22 → 1280.16] And then while you
[1280.16 → 1280.92] keep talking about
[1280.92 → 1281.52] CES plans,
[1281.62 → 1282.06] I'm going to take
[1282.06 → 1282.92] off the bottom part
[1282.92 → 1283.54] of the panel so they
[1283.54 → 1283.96] can see where the
[1283.96 → 1284.62] graphics cards go.
[1284.84 → 1285.24] Again,
[1285.40 → 1285.92] we haven't really
[1285.92 → 1286.80] talked about CES plans
[1286.80 → 1287.82] much so I don't know.
[1288.34 → 1288.72] That's okay.
[1288.84 → 1290.14] If you commit things
[1290.14 → 1290.74] to them now,
[1290.82 → 1291.34] then there's nothing
[1291.34 → 1292.20] I can do about it
[1292.20 → 1292.78] and we'll have to do
[1292.78 → 1293.32] your ideas.
[1293.78 → 1294.44] So we're going to be
[1294.44 → 1295.96] eating out very nicely
[1295.96 → 1296.90] the entire time
[1296.90 → 1297.32] we're there.
[1298.02 → 1298.84] This is coming out
[1298.84 → 1299.50] of my pocket,
[1299.50 → 1299.96] by the way.
[1299.96 → 1300.20] All sponsored
[1300.20 → 1301.12] by the company.
[1303.34 → 1304.16] No, no, no.
[1304.22 → 1304.46] Okay.
[1305.20 → 1305.86] We'll probably be
[1305.86 → 1306.46] eating McDonald's
[1306.46 → 1306.94] the entire time.
[1307.98 → 1308.78] You'll be lucky
[1308.78 → 1309.72] if you get McDonald's
[1309.72 → 1309.98] now.
[1312.96 → 1313.44] Yeah,
[1313.82 → 1314.96] Samsung has
[1314.96 → 1315.86] an interesting TV
[1315.86 → 1316.98] that we're releasing.
[1317.32 → 1317.78] They released
[1317.78 → 1318.56] this press release.
[1318.56 → 1320.66] Go to the site.
[1320.66 → 1320.92] Here.
[1321.74 → 1323.52] Number four.
[1326.90 → 1335.90] 23.
[1335.90 → 1336.46] 23.
[1336.46 → 1336.56] 23.
[1356.90 → 1367.02] growing host
[1367.02 → 1367.56] picture point
[1367.56 → 1369.00] sorry¿is notice
[1369.00 → 1369.08] the audio?
[1369.08 → 1371.12] Is there audio still?
[1371.20 → 1373.64] Is there audio now?
[1374.36 → 1375.32] Can you just
[1375.32 → 1376.92] -
[1376.92 → 1377.74] if you
[1377.74 → 1378.32] the screen
[1378.32 → 1378.36] or recognize
[1378.36 → 1379.32] another one?
[1379.32 → 1383.12] Cut out the audio?
[1383.12 → 1384.12] Is there audio still?
[1384.12 → 1386.12] Is there audio now?
[1386.12 → 1399.12] Okay, so we can't show the audio.
[1399.12 → 1400.12] Yeah, we can.
[1400.12 → 1401.12] It's fixed now.
[1401.12 → 1402.12] Is it?
[1402.12 → 1403.12] Yup.
[1403.12 → 1405.12] Don't worry, I fixed it.
[1405.12 → 1406.12] It's all good.
[1406.12 → 1407.12] It's all good.
[1407.12 → 1408.12] No audio.
[1408.12 → 1409.12] When you switch, it's gone.
[1409.12 → 1410.12] No, there's audio now.
[1410.12 → 1411.12] Audio fixed.
[1411.12 → 1412.12] Ah!
[1412.12 → 1414.12] Everyone's so back and forth.
[1414.12 → 1415.12] Okay, here.
[1415.12 → 1417.12] Tell them about it.
[1417.12 → 1423.12] Okay, so as you can see there, Samsung released this picture and then some blurb about how
[1423.12 → 1428.12] true innovation comes when you change the shape of things.
[1428.12 → 1429.12] Something.
[1429.12 → 1430.12] Something along those lines.
[1430.12 → 1435.12] Basically, this huge thing about how they're changing the shape of the TV and then they
[1435.12 → 1436.12] turn it into this picture.
[1436.12 → 1440.12] Which makes me think like, why is it in portrait mode?
[1440.12 → 1443.12] And that's not really a different shape either.
[1443.12 → 1444.12] No.
[1444.12 → 1445.12] It's just a rotated shape.
[1445.12 → 1446.12] You turned it like this.
[1446.12 → 1448.12] Well, they can't see you right now.
[1448.12 → 1449.12] Oh, right.
[1449.12 → 1450.12] Okay.
[1450.12 → 1451.12] Well, they turned it vertical into portrait mode.
[1451.12 → 1452.12] Okay, you can switch back.
[1452.12 → 1453.12] Press one.
[1453.12 → 1454.12] Okay.
[1454.12 → 1459.12] So, I don't understand how this is different from taking an existing TV and just bloop.
[1459.12 → 1462.12] I like, they have a driver control panel for that.
[1462.12 → 1466.12] I think it's called, you know, the Nvidia control panel or ATI control panel.
[1466.12 → 1467.12] I mean, just turn your monitor.
[1467.12 → 1468.12] I don't know.
[1468.12 → 1473.12] I'm kind of hoping it's more than just a portrait mode TV because I don't see a portrait mode
[1473.12 → 1476.12] TV being very applicable.
[1476.12 → 1483.12] Maybe the point they're trying to make is the extreme realism of the image and like how
[1483.12 → 1484.12] thin it is or something.
[1484.12 → 1487.12] It's an awful lot of hype to generate over.
[1487.12 → 1491.12] But then the second you try and watch a movie, is it going to be like half your screen
[1491.12 → 1492.12] is gone?
[1492.12 → 1494.12] No, there's no way it's a portrait mode TV.
[1494.12 → 1495.12] But look at the shape it's in.
[1495.12 → 1498.12] I know, but you could just take that shape and go like this.
[1498.12 → 1500.12] So what, are you just going to constantly swivel your TV?
[1500.12 → 1502.12] No, I mean, it might just be thinner.
[1502.12 → 1503.12] Oh, I don't know.
[1503.12 → 1509.12] But then this is, like I said, this is a lot of hype to generate over thinner and brighter
[1509.12 → 1512.12] and more vibrant and more 3D, which is what we all do.
[1512.12 → 1513.12] Probably what it is.
[1513.12 → 1519.12] Like, since I started going to CES, it's been nothing but 3D TVs.
[1519.12 → 1526.12] And here we are, what, three, four years later, and it's still 3D TVs.
[1526.12 → 1528.12] And I'm just kind of like, okay.
[1528.12 → 1534.12] So last year, the big thing was 3D TVs, but not using them for 3D.
[1534.12 → 1541.12] It was like having alternating images so that two people could watch TV at something else
[1541.12 → 1542.12] at the same time.
[1542.12 → 1543.12] Yeah.
[1543.12 → 1544.12] Or not split screen gaming.
[1544.12 → 1545.12] Like PlayStation TV.
[1545.12 → 1546.12] Yes.
[1546.12 → 1547.12] Something like that.
[1547.12 → 1548.12] Has it, has it, okay, here.
[1548.12 → 1550.12] Would love to hear this, guys.
[1550.12 → 1556.12] Has anyone on Twitter or, or in the Twitch chat actually encountered someone who is actually
[1556.12 → 1558.12] using that solution?
[1558.12 → 1560.12] Are we local recording as well?
[1560.12 → 1562.12] I don't know.
[1562.12 → 1563.12] Yeah.
[1563.12 → 1564.12] Local recording.
[1564.12 → 1565.12] Yeah.
[1565.12 → 1566.12] Oh, press zero.
[1566.12 → 1567.12] Yay.
[1567.12 → 1568.12] Okay.
[1568.12 → 1569.12] So yeah.
[1569.12 → 1572.12] One of my old roommates.
[1572.12 → 1579.12] Where two people are playing the game at the same time, seeing different, oh, that guy?
[1579.12 → 1580.12] Yeah.
[1580.12 → 1581.12] Oh, okay.
[1581.12 → 1582.12] Yeah.
[1582.12 → 1584.12] So, I don't know if it really counts.
[1584.12 → 1586.12] So it was like Black Ops zombies?
[1586.12 → 1588.12] That's exactly what it was.
[1588.12 → 1591.12] Black Ops, Black Ops fanboy.
[1591.12 → 1593.12] But only the zombie mod.
[1593.12 → 1595.12] I only knew that he did it once.
[1595.12 → 1596.12] I don't know if he did it other than that.
[1596.12 → 1601.12] And it was with like one of his buddies who also used to be a roommate of ours quite a
[1601.12 → 1602.12] while ago.
[1602.12 → 1603.12] Um, yeah.
[1603.12 → 1606.12] I'm ready to show them the rest of this system now.
[1606.12 → 1607.12] Go for it.
[1607.12 → 1608.12] I don't have anything else to say.
[1608.12 → 1609.12] So check this out, guys.
[1609.12 → 1611.12] So I had two GeForce graphics cards in here.
[1611.12 → 1612.12] Two GTX 680s.
[1612.12 → 1614.12] So they were going all the way to here.
[1614.12 → 1616.12] There's the power supply.
[1616.12 → 1617.12] There's the CPU heat sink.
[1617.12 → 1620.12] You can put up to 32 gigs of RAM in here.
[1620.12 → 1622.12] Just a monster.
[1622.12 → 1623.12] Monster machine.
[1623.12 → 1625.12] Check out that fan in the top.
[1625.12 → 1629.12] Just like almost hilariously, stupidly full of stuff.
[1629.12 → 1633.12] So anyway, what I'm trying to say is not that it's not a really cool case.
[1633.12 → 1636.12] And not that it isn't a really cool machine.
[1636.12 → 1638.12] But that it was really hard to build in.
[1638.12 → 1644.12] And because when you film a How to Build a PC episode, there's no such thing as like
[1644.12 → 1650.12] running some benchmarks and doing some prep before the episode.
[1650.12 → 1651.12] Like you can prep.
[1651.12 → 1653.12] You can sort of, you can read up on it.
[1653.12 → 1657.12] You can sort of like, you can bust around with things and see how it all works.
[1657.12 → 1659.12] But you have to actually build it.
[1659.12 → 1661.12] You have to actually do every step.
[1661.12 → 1663.12] And some of them were just really hard to do.
[1663.12 → 1664.12] Yeah.
[1664.12 → 1669.12] I was off in the corner with my crazy setup of multiple servers messing around with Medium.
[1669.12 → 1673.12] Hearing like, oh, oh, we have to redo that.
[1673.12 → 1675.12] I have to take the motherboard out again.
[1675.12 → 1677.12] Just like, oh.
[1677.12 → 1680.12] I could hear the amount of frustrated that was on the other side of the room.
[1680.12 → 1681.12] You know what?
[1681.12 → 1683.12] It wasn't as bad as the FT-03 Mini one though.
[1683.12 → 1685.12] That one, that was just a weird case.
[1685.12 → 1686.12] It's very cool.
[1686.12 → 1687.12] Very cool.
[1687.12 → 1688.12] Again.
[1688.12 → 1689.12] It's a column.
[1689.12 → 1690.12] Yeah.
[1690.12 → 1691.12] It's a column case.
[1691.12 → 1696.12] And again, like an impressive amount of hardware in a small space.
[1696.12 → 1697.12] Yeah.
[1697.12 → 1698.12] But, but very dense.
[1698.12 → 1704.12] At least the power supply was a lot easier on this one than it was on the FT-03 Mini.
[1704.12 → 1706.12] Because of the short cables.
[1706.12 → 1709.12] Because of the short cable kit that you can get with Strider Series power supplies.
[1709.12 → 1711.12] So, here, let's do some Twitter.
[1711.12 → 1712.12] Oh, okay.
[1712.12 → 1713.12] You know what?
[1713.12 → 1714.12] I'll just do this.
[1714.12 → 1718.12] Okay, so put that there.
[1718.12 → 1719.12] Get Twitter.
[1719.12 → 1720.12] Get that.
[1720.12 → 1721.12] Where's the Twinkle box?
[1721.12 → 1723.12] Twinkle box is...
[1723.12 → 1724.12] Slick's in the way.
[1724.12 → 1725.12] Right there.
[1725.12 → 1726.12] Alright.
[1726.12 → 1728.12] Minus, what tips do you have for up-and-coming tech people?
[1728.12 → 1729.12] Read lots.
[1729.12 → 1732.12] Reading lots is the most important thing for up-and-coming tech people.
[1732.12 → 1734.12] Go on our forum when it's up.
[1734.12 → 1735.12] Yeah.
[1735.12 → 1736.12] Hey, hey, that too.
[1736.12 → 1739.12] There's going to be lots of up-and-coming tech people here.
[1739.12 → 1740.12] This is for Slick.
[1740.12 → 1742.12] Where can I get Ducky Keyboards?
[1742.12 → 1744.12] Uh, Tiger Imports.
[1744.12 → 1745.12] Google Tiger Imports.
[1745.12 → 1749.12] Is a CM Storm trigger with blue switches worth my money?
[1749.12 → 1751.12] What's a Storm trigger?
[1751.12 → 1752.12] CM Storm trigger.
[1752.12 → 1753.12] Didn't you unbox one?
[1753.12 → 1754.12] I was pretty sure you unboxed.
[1754.12 → 1755.12] No, that was a quick fire.
[1755.12 → 1757.12] What's the difference between a trigger and a quick fire?
[1757.12 → 1759.12] I'm pretty sure you unboxed a trigger.
[1759.12 → 1761.12] I guess basically...
[1761.12 → 1762.12] They're good.
[1762.12 → 1763.12] They're quite good keyboards.
[1763.12 → 1764.12] Okay.
[1764.12 → 1765.12] Yeah.
[1765.12 → 1766.12] I didn't know.
[1766.12 → 1767.12] Yay!
[1767.12 → 1768.12] Tuning in at 5.30.
[1768.12 → 1769.12] We're sorry we're late, guys.
[1769.12 → 1771.12] Crazy problems.
[1771.12 → 1773.12] Watch the archive if you're tuning in.
[1773.12 → 1774.12] Here.
[1774.12 → 1776.12] Move closer to the camera.
[1776.12 → 1778.12] Look at his eyes.
[1778.12 → 1780.12] I'm pretty tight.
[1780.12 → 1783.12] I had no idea why you're making me go close to the camera.
[1783.12 → 1788.12] Buy Canon last time.
[1788.12 → 1789.12] I hate Sony.
[1789.12 → 1790.12] You ever set it back to stock.
[1790.12 → 1792.12] Trust me, that won't fix the problem.
[1792.12 → 1795.12] And we are using a Canon now.
[1795.12 → 1796.12] Which has...
[1796.12 → 1798.12] This Canon camera has its own set of issues as well.
[1798.12 → 1799.12] Oh yeah.
[1799.12 → 1801.12] Okay, we're back to like 24 minutes ago.
[1801.12 → 1802.12] So...
[1802.12 → 1808.12] I saw a bunch of people posting that they had never seen anyone do the split screen monitor thing.
[1808.12 → 1809.12] Yeah.
[1809.12 → 1812.12] I jumped over there while you were doing the system and like, just everyone was like,
[1812.12 → 1813.12] Nope.
[1813.12 → 1814.12] Nope.
[1814.12 → 1815.12] Definitely not.
[1815.12 → 1816.12] Nope.
[1816.12 → 1817.12] Definitely not.
[1817.12 → 1818.12] Okay.
[1818.12 → 1819.12] Okay.
[1819.12 → 1823.12] Here's a good question from Marcus.
[1823.12 → 1827.12] What do you expect from AMD at CES?
[1827.12 → 1828.12] Expect?
[1828.12 → 1831.12] I'm going to go look for some of my topics that I had up.
[1831.12 → 1832.12] So, I'll get you...
[1832.12 → 1834.12] What do you expect from AMD at CES?
[1834.12 → 1836.12] I don't expect much.
[1836.12 → 1839.12] I hope for a lot.
[1839.12 → 1845.12] Honestly, to be 100% honest, they haven't been moving that quickly lately over the last few years.
[1845.12 → 1847.12] But they need to.
[1847.12 → 1851.12] So, hopefully if they come out with some crazy awesome stuff at CES, that would be great.
[1851.12 → 1853.12] When was the last time you had an AMD rig?
[1853.12 → 1854.12] Uh...
[1854.12 → 1855.12] Athlon 64.
[1856.12 → 1859.12] And then I built one for my parents that was Athlon 64X2.
[1859.12 → 1861.12] I loved both of those processors.
[1861.12 → 1862.12] They're amazing.
[1862.12 → 1864.12] Great, great, great processors.
[1864.12 → 1865.12] And then...
[1865.12 → 1867.12] Yeah, ever since then.
[1867.12 → 1868.12] What about on the graphics card side?
[1868.12 → 1871.12] They've been starting to talk about 8000 series, particularly mobile.
[1871.12 → 1874.12] They do well on the graphics card side though.
[1874.12 → 1875.12] ATI is very strong.
[1875.12 → 1876.12] AMD ATI is very strong.
[1876.12 → 1879.12] You can usually get more frames for your dollar.
[1879.12 → 1882.12] From what I've seen going with AMD cards.
[1882.12 → 1883.12] Um...
[1883.12 → 1886.12] Whether that makes you buy them or not, that's totally up to you.
[1886.12 → 1887.12] Um...
[1887.12 → 1888.12] But yeah.
[1888.12 → 1890.12] Usually you can pump them really hard.
[1890.12 → 1892.12] You can usually overclock them like crazy.
[1892.12 → 1893.12] Um...
[1893.12 → 1894.12] Yeah, I don't know.
[1894.12 → 1895.12] But...
[1895.12 → 1898.12] I'm worried about the processor side.
[1898.12 → 1900.12] Very worried about the processor side.
[1900.12 → 1902.12] But then again, they could come up with something crazy.
[1902.12 → 1903.12] So hopefully they do.
[1903.12 → 1904.12] That'll be great at CES.
[1904.12 → 1906.12] I mean, I'd love to see how the whole...
[1906.12 → 1907.12] I mean...
[1907.12 → 1911.12] Okay, we talked a little bit about the NVIDIA Intel potential merger.
[1911.12 → 1912.12] The rumour!
[1912.12 → 1914.12] Just a rumour guys, right now.
[1914.12 → 1917.12] But we talked a little bit about what that could mean for the future.
[1917.12 → 1919.12] Maybe particularly on mobile.
[1919.12 → 1922.12] When you look at Intel's expertise on manufacturing.
[1922.12 → 1925.12] NVIDIA's expertise on GPU and their experience with ARM.
[1925.12 → 1928.12] And just like what kind of crazy processors we could see.
[1928.12 → 1930.12] I would love to see.
[1930.12 → 1933.12] I mean, they've talked about how they're going to focus more on it.
[1933.12 → 1934.12] And...
[1934.12 → 1936.12] Oh shoot, what was his name?
[1937.12 → 1939.12] I can't remember.
[1939.12 → 1942.12] One of their CEOs got outed not that long ago.
[1942.12 → 1944.12] Because he said he didn't care about mobile.
[1944.12 → 1946.12] And it seems like something they do want to do.
[1946.12 → 1951.12] But I'd love to see what AMD and ATI could deliver.
[1951.12 → 1955.12] Because the only reason that Terra has any huge advantage over anything.
[1955.12 → 1958.12] Is that GeForce ecosystem.
[1958.12 → 1961.12] And I'm not even talking just the graphics performance of it.
[1961.12 → 1965.12] Because it's not that competitive compared to something like iPad.
[1965.12 → 1966.12] Like...
[1970.12 → 1971.12] Not today!
[1971.12 → 1975.12] Or even some of the other solutions.
[1975.12 → 1980.12] But the GeForce ecosystem is the developer relationships.
[1980.12 → 1986.12] It is the way that they're used to writing games that are powered by GeForce.
[1986.12 → 1988.12] Compatibility, developer relationships.
[1988.12 → 1989.12] Yes!
[1989.12 → 1990.12] Stuff always working.
[1990.12 → 1996.12] The fact that a Terra 3 runs pretty much the same damn way as a GTX 680.
[1996.12 → 1997.12] On some level.
[1997.12 → 2000.12] Just the way that the software and the hardware are interfacing.
[2000.12 → 2002.12] And the way that the game interacts with it.
[2002.12 → 2006.12] So that is why Terra is so important right now.
[2006.12 → 2012.12] Whereas AMD, maybe not quite to the same extent as Nvidia in terms of developer relationships.
[2012.12 → 2016.12] But so much stronger than Qualcomm.
[2016.12 → 2017.12] Yeah.
[2017.12 → 2018.12] Or Intel.
[2018.12 → 2019.12] Or...
[2019.12 → 2021.12] I mean name anyone else.
[2021.12 → 2022.12] It's a two horse race.
[2022.12 → 2023.12] ATI Nvidia.
[2023.12 → 2024.12] Radeon GeForce.
[2024.12 → 2031.12] So I'd love for them to just kind of show up to that fight and start doing something.
[2031.12 → 2032.12] Somewhere.
[2032.12 → 2033.12] Somewhere.
[2033.12 → 2034.12] Somewhere.
[2034.12 → 2035.12] Something.
[2035.12 → 2036.12] Something interesting.
[2036.12 → 2038.12] We were talking about graphics cards.
[2038.12 → 2041.12] Far Cry 3 really surprised me with how hard it was to run.
[2041.12 → 2043.12] I don't think Linus has played it yet.
[2043.12 → 2044.12] But you were a big fan of Far Cry 2, weren't you?
[2044.12 → 2045.12] I...
[2045.12 → 2046.12] No.
[2046.12 → 2047.12] Far Cry 2 was terrible.
[2047.12 → 2048.12] I thought you liked it.
[2048.12 → 2049.12] Far Cry 2 was a piece of crap.
[2049.12 → 2051.12] I thought you said you played it a bunch of times.
[2051.12 → 2052.12] Far Cry 1.
[2052.12 → 2053.12] Ohhhh.
[2053.12 → 2054.12] Loved Far Cry 1.
[2054.12 → 2056.12] Far Cry 1 was an outstanding game.
[2056.12 → 2057.12] Did you ever play it?
[2057.12 → 2058.12] You're a little young for that.
[2058.12 → 2059.12] Far Cry 1?
[2059.12 → 2060.12] Yeah.
[2060.12 → 2063.12] What were you like 9 when it came out?
[2063.12 → 2064.12] I don't think so.
[2064.12 → 2065.12] I'm pretty sure.
[2065.12 → 2066.12] Maybe.
[2066.12 → 2067.12] Maybe like 11.
[2067.12 → 2068.12] I don't know.
[2068.12 → 2071.12] Yeah you were like a kid when Far Cry 1 came out.
[2071.12 → 2072.12] That's weird.
[2072.12 → 2073.12] I feel weird.
[2073.12 → 2074.12] Yeah I feel old.
[2074.12 → 2075.12] Ugh.
[2075.12 → 2076.12] Anyway.
[2076.12 → 2077.12] Anyway yeah Far Cry 1 was good.
[2077.12 → 2078.12] Far Cry 2 was crap.
[2078.12 → 2079.12] The respawning guys.
[2079.12 → 2081.12] Oh that stuff was crap.
[2081.12 → 2082.12] I...
[2082.12 → 2084.12] Okay you know what though?
[2084.12 → 2086.12] I forgot about this.
[2086.12 → 2087.12] This is a good story.
[2087.12 → 2088.12] Far Cry 2.
[2088.12 → 2089.12] I actually played it a fair bit.
[2089.12 → 2090.12] Because I hadn't really played...
[2090.12 → 2095.12] Like I'd never played Grand Theft Auto or like any other sort of open world sandbox.
[2095.12 → 2096.12] Right okay yeah.
[2096.12 → 2098.12] So I'd never really done that whole thing.
[2098.12 → 2103.12] And the graphics were great, and you know the gun play is good and all of that.
[2103.12 → 2104.12] Um...
[2104.12 → 2106.12] I couldn't finish it.
[2106.12 → 2111.12] I got a save game like all the way deep into the game.
[2111.12 → 2113.12] And did you play Far Cry 2?
[2113.12 → 2116.12] Yeah but really quickly and once.
[2116.12 → 2117.12] Okay.
[2117.12 → 2119.12] One of the things is that you're sick.
[2119.12 → 2120.12] Do you remember that?
[2120.12 → 2121.12] Yeah.
[2121.12 → 2122.12] Okay you get sick.
[2122.12 → 2126.12] So you have to get like malaria medications like sometimes.
[2126.12 → 2132.12] And what happens is it gives you like a notification that you need to get malaria meds like soon.
[2132.12 → 2136.12] And so on of my save games and I think it was auto...
[2136.12 → 2138.12] Is it auto save for that game or something like that?
[2138.12 → 2139.12] Oh no.
[2139.12 → 2140.12] I was...
[2140.12 → 2144.12] Physically too far away to get anywhere with meds.
[2144.12 → 2148.12] I tried probably a dozen times in every direction in every possible way.
[2148.12 → 2150.12] So I would just die.
[2150.12 → 2152.12] And I was like well I'm not starting over.
[2154.12 → 2156.12] Cause the whole game is just a grind.
[2156.12 → 2158.12] My best story with that is Borrowing.
[2158.12 → 2161.12] You start the game, and they give you this package.
[2161.12 → 2162.12] And you're supposed to go give it to this guy.
[2162.12 → 2165.12] But it's just like oh yeah give this package to this guy.
[2165.12 → 2166.12] And you can sell it.
[2166.12 → 2169.12] So at the beginning of the game you're like oh I want money.
[2169.12 → 2171.12] You sell everything in your inventory.
[2171.12 → 2172.12] You're done.
[2172.12 → 2174.12] You can't start the main quest.
[2174.12 → 2176.12] But it doesn't exactly tell you what the main quest is.
[2176.12 → 2180.12] Because it's a like Uber definition of sandbox game right.
[2180.12 → 2181.12] Like amazing game.
[2181.12 → 2184.12] But you could just go screw off like I played this game for months.
[2185.12 → 2187.12] And had no idea what the main quest was.
[2187.12 → 2188.12] Had never started it.
[2188.12 → 2189.12] Had multiple characters.
[2189.12 → 2191.12] Always sold the book.
[2191.12 → 2192.12] Or package thing.
[2192.12 → 2197.12] Eventually my dad and I were like this game is amazing, but we know we're missing a lot.
[2197.12 → 2200.12] Let's go get the player's guide so we can find all the stuff that we're missing.
[2200.12 → 2202.12] While the player's guide I was like whoa.
[2203.12 → 2205.12] There's a main quest, and it's interesting.
[2205.12 → 2207.12] Let's go actually start playing the game.
[2207.12 → 2209.12] That is so much worse than mine.
[2209.12 → 2211.12] That it's not even funny.
[2212.12 → 2213.12] I love Borrowing.
[2213.12 → 2215.12] Logged so many hours in that game but.
[2215.12 → 2217.12] Without even actually playing the game.
[2217.12 → 2218.12] Without playing the main quest.
[2218.12 → 2220.12] But that's how good that game was.
[2220.12 → 2221.12] Like it didn't matter.
[2221.12 → 2222.12] I never got into it.
[2222.12 → 2227.12] I think it doesn't help though that I'd already logged like a bazillion hours on Oblivion.
[2227.12 → 2229.12] And then I tried to go back and play Borrowing.
[2229.12 → 2230.12] You kind of have to go through it later.
[2230.12 → 2232.12] Because I'd never played Borrowing before that.
[2232.12 → 2236.12] The journal system in Borrowing is very difficult to just pick up.
[2236.12 → 2237.12] You have to be used to it.
[2237.12 → 2240.12] And like once you get I think it's the Tribunal expansion.
[2240.12 → 2243.12] It makes it so you can actually navigate to individual quests.
[2243.12 → 2244.12] In your journal.
[2244.12 → 2245.12] But before then.
[2245.12 → 2248.12] It's just your guy writing logs about things that's happening.
[2248.12 → 2250.12] And it's just like a journal.
[2250.12 → 2253.12] So if something happened a couple of days ago.
[2253.12 → 2254.12] And you've done a bunch of stuff.
[2254.12 → 2256.12] To figure out where you're at that quest.
[2256.12 → 2258.12] You have to like to flip through pages.
[2258.12 → 2259.12] And like figure it out.
[2259.12 → 2261.12] Like it's not very noob friendly.
[2261.12 → 2264.12] And I like I fired it up once.
[2264.12 → 2265.12] And I got my character.
[2265.12 → 2267.12] And I was going to be like a cat dude.
[2267.12 → 2269.12] And I went like down a path.
[2269.12 → 2270.12] And it was just like.
[2270.12 → 2274.12] And I was like well come on.
[2274.12 → 2278.12] What there's no like noob friendly like.
[2278.12 → 2280.12] Questing zone at the beginning.
[2280.12 → 2282.12] A little bit but not that much.
[2282.12 → 2284.12] The second you step like a little bit past the line.
[2284.12 → 2285.12] You're done.
[2285.12 → 2288.12] And like it's got D&D rolling systems for attacks.
[2288.12 → 2290.12] So if you run up to something you can be like.
[2290.12 → 2292.12] I'm not hitting you.
[2292.12 → 2294.12] Because you'll just keep on rolling.
[2294.12 → 2296.12] And if you're not good enough at that skill.
[2296.12 → 2297.12] So like say dagger.
[2297.12 → 2300.12] I can just stab and stab and stab and stab and stab.
[2300.12 → 2301.12] And never hit them.
[2301.12 → 2302.12] Like ha ha ha.
[2302.12 → 2303.12] Ha ha.
[2303.12 → 2306.12] My defence numbers are higher than your dagger rolling numbers.
[2306.12 → 2307.12] I then win.
[2307.12 → 2308.12] Because of the D&D system right.
[2308.12 → 2310.12] So it's not very noob friendly in that aspect.
[2310.12 → 2311.12] Right.
[2313.12 → 2316.12] Okay well I had a topic for discussion.
[2316.12 → 2317.12] Um.
[2317.12 → 2318.12] Why.
[2318.12 → 2319.12] Does Nero.
[2319.12 → 2322.12] Bother to still update.
[2322.12 → 2324.12] Their disc burning software.
[2324.12 → 2326.12] We talked about this a bit ago.
[2326.12 → 2327.12] Uh.
[2327.12 → 2330.12] The only thing I was able to come up with.
[2330.12 → 2332.12] Was compatibility with different systems.
[2332.12 → 2334.12] Okay let me put it this way.
[2334.12 → 2336.12] It still works on everything.
[2336.12 → 2339.12] I have an ancient version of Nero.
[2339.12 → 2340.12] That I bought way back.
[2340.12 → 2342.12] Like early XP days.
[2342.12 → 2345.12] Back when you bought burning software.
[2345.12 → 2346.12] Because now there's free.
[2346.12 → 2347.12] Okay so okay.
[2347.12 → 2351.12] So aside from the fact that it doesn't need any new functionality.
[2351.12 → 2354.12] There's free options that are just as good now.
[2354.12 → 2355.12] Is that maybe the thing then?
[2355.12 → 2356.12] They roll out a new version.
[2356.12 → 2357.12] Make you buy the new version.
[2357.12 → 2358.12] Make you buy the new version.
[2358.12 → 2359.12] How?
[2359.12 → 2360.12] They don't make you buy it.
[2360.12 → 2363.12] That same version runs on Windows 8.
[2363.12 → 2364.12] Just fine.
[2364.12 → 2365.12] No, no I know.
[2365.12 → 2366.12] But like.
[2366.12 → 2367.12] Like no cares.
[2367.12 → 2368.12] If you have version 4.
[2368.12 → 2369.12] To get version 5.
[2369.12 → 2370.12] I'm just using random numbers.
[2370.12 → 2371.12] Why would you want version 5?
[2371.12 → 2372.12] I'm just saying.
[2372.12 → 2373.12] If you had version 4.
[2373.12 → 2374.12] To get version 5.
[2374.12 → 2375.12] Do you have to buy it?
[2375.12 → 2376.12] Or does it update?
[2376.12 → 2377.12] I think you have to buy it.
[2377.12 → 2378.12] Yeah.
[2378.12 → 2379.12] Yeah okay.
[2379.12 → 2380.12] So it's for people that aren't super tech-savvy.
[2380.12 → 2381.12] And they're like oh I need the newest best one.
[2381.12 → 2384.12] What could they possibly think they need the newest best one for though?
[2384.12 → 2385.12] I don't know.
[2385.12 → 2386.12] Like why don't.
[2386.12 → 2387.12] Because everyone says keep your stuff updated.
[2387.12 → 2388.12] Okay why don't they just do this then?
[2388.12 → 2390.12] Why don't they just lay off their entire development team.
[2390.12 → 2391.12] And just change numbers.
[2391.12 → 2392.12] And just change the numbers.
[2392.12 → 2393.12] And reskin it.
[2393.12 → 2395.12] Hire some designers to reskin it.
[2395.12 → 2399.12] Hire one designer and fire your entire development team.
[2399.12 → 2400.12] I don't know.
[2400.12 → 2404.12] What new functionality is there in disk burning over the last 6 years?
[2404.12 → 2405.12] Light Scribe?
[2405.12 → 2407.12] Light Scribe, Disc.
[2407.12 → 2410.12] Disc doesn't require special software.
[2410.12 → 2412.12] Is that all done through the LG drive?
[2412.12 → 2415.12] All done through the special laser that engraves into the special medium.
[2415.12 → 2417.12] Nothing on the software side.
[2417.12 → 2418.12] Alright so that's just the drive.
[2418.12 → 2419.12] Yeah so Light Scribe.
[2419.12 → 2420.12] And Light Scribe.
[2420.12 → 2421.12] Blu-ray.
[2421.12 → 2422.12] Blu-ray.
[2422.12 → 2425.12] Is it the same on the software end?
[2425.12 → 2428.12] Okay it's possible we need a Blu-ray software.
[2428.12 → 2429.12] Blu-ray burning.
[2429.12 → 2430.12] Who would burn a Blu-ray?
[2430.12 → 2431.12] I don't know.
[2431.12 → 2433.12] I'm just saying.
[2433.12 → 2434.12] Why?
[2434.12 → 2436.12] There might be something on the software end.
[2436.12 → 2438.12] Okay for all of you out there who have burned a Blu-ray.
[2438.12 → 2445.12] I'm going to open your eyes to a fantastic world of amazingness that you are just going to be blown
[2445.12 → 2446.12] away by.
[2446.12 → 2453.12] It is called the Archiving Your Stuff on a Hard Drive System.
[2453.12 → 2454.12] Okay.
[2454.12 → 2455.12] So Blu-ray discs.
[2455.12 → 2456.12] How much do they cost now?
[2456.12 → 2457.12] I don't know.
[2457.12 → 2458.12] I've never bought one.
[2458.12 → 2461.12] Last time I looked it was around 8 bucks, but I'm sure it's cheaper now.
[2461.12 → 2466.12] Let's say they're, let's say they're $3?
[2466.12 → 2467.12] Just for the sake of argument.
[2467.12 → 2468.12] Let's say they're $3.
[2468.12 → 2470.12] How many gigs of data do they store on them?
[2470.12 → 2471.12] It's 25 right?
[2471.12 → 2472.12] I'm sure someone's going to correct us.
[2472.12 → 2475.12] Yeah but then you can get these dual layers.
[2475.12 → 2476.12] Yeah but those cost a lot.
[2476.12 → 2477.12] I'm sure they do, yeah.
[2477.12 → 2480.12] Those are actually like baller expensive.
[2480.12 → 2481.12] Yeah.
[2481.12 → 2482.12] So okay.
[2482.12 → 2484.12] So 25 gigs on a Blu-ray.
[2484.12 → 2488.12] So here, this is, this is a here we're going to do a quick price comparison here.
[2488.12 → 2491.12] So NCIX.com.
[2491.12 → 2496.12] We're gonna look at how much a 2TB external drive costs.
[2496.12 → 2499.12] So, the the the the the the the the the.
[2499.12 → 2501.12] Around a hundred bucks.
[2501.12 → 2502.12] Okay.
[2502.12 → 2506.12] So that is 2,000 divided by 25.
[2506.12 → 2511.12] 25 equals 80 Blu-ray discs.
[2511.12 → 2514.12] So Blu-ray.
[2514.12 → 2516.12] It already loses.
[2516.12 → 2518.12] Whoa, hold on.
[2518.12 → 2520.12] Okay, these are, okay hold on.
[2520.12 → 2521.12] Blu-ray disc.
[2521.12 → 2522.12] There we go.
[2522.12 → 2526.12] So single Blu-ray disc, well that's a 50 gig for 7 bucks.
[2526.12 → 2527.12] Okay.
[2527.12 → 2529.12] And there's a rewritable for 10.
[2529.12 → 2532.12] By the way, hard drives are all rewritable.
[2532.12 → 2533.12] Okay.
[2533.12 → 2535.12] Probably more than your rewritable disc.
[2535.12 → 2536.12] Okay.
[2536.12 → 2540.12] I can't even see, like there's a 2 pack for 30 bucks.
[2540.12 → 2543.12] How much do these things cost?
[2543.12 → 2544.12] These can't be right.
[2544.12 → 2545.12] Seriously?
[2545.12 → 2546.12] Okay.
[2546.12 → 2549.12] This is worse than I thought.
[2549.12 → 2550.12] Okay.
[2550.12 → 2551.12] So for...
[2551.12 → 2552.12] Okay.
[2552.12 → 2553.12] Okay.
[2553.12 → 2554.12] So, oh okay.
[2554.12 → 2562.12] So you can get them for as little as around a buck.
[2562.12 → 2564.12] But that's like Rosewall.
[2564.12 → 2570.12] So anything that's like a real brand is probably more like double that.
[2570.12 → 2571.12] Two bucks.
[2571.12 → 2572.12] So about two bucks each.
[2572.12 → 2573.12] So $160.
[2573.12 → 2574.12] Yeah.
[2574.12 → 2577.12] So $160 is what you're paying for your Blu-ray discs.
[2577.12 → 2578.12] Oh man, guys.
[2578.12 → 2579.12] Just don't do it.
[2579.12 → 2582.12] I mean something like this is so perfect.
[2582.12 → 2588.12] These backup pluses are great because they come on a little like dock thing.
[2588.12 → 2590.12] Here's a tech tip for you guys.
[2590.12 → 2592.12] Back everything up to hard drives.
[2592.12 → 2595.12] So they come on a little dock thing.
[2595.12 → 2596.12] And then look at this.
[2596.12 → 2599.12] It's basically like the size of like a VHS cassette.
[2599.12 → 2601.12] So you just have a shelf.
[2601.12 → 2602.12] You like put these on it.
[2602.12 → 2607.12] You put a label on the handy dandy label friendly spot with some masking tape.
[2607.12 → 2608.12] Boom.
[2608.12 → 2614.12] You've archived your media on something that is less likely to degrade than a plastic disc.
[2614.12 → 2621.12] On something that is much more likely to still be around in the future in terms of finding something that will read it easily.
[2621.12 → 2623.12] Although CD has been pretty resilient.
[2623.12 → 2625.12] But then how useful is a CD at this point?
[2625.12 → 2627.12] You can repurpose it for other things.
[2627.12 → 2631.12] You can take the whole thing apart, repurpose it for an internal drive, throw it in a server.
[2631.12 → 2637.12] You can easily swap them in and out just by popping them onto a base station just like that.
[2637.12 → 2640.12] And you can plug as many or as few into your computer as you want.
[2640.12 → 2645.12] You can sync from one to another one so you can back up from one to another.
[2645.12 → 2646.12] They're faster to write.
[2646.12 → 2648.12] I mean do I even need to do this?
[2648.12 → 2656.12] The only disc solution that I would ever see being better than that is like super, super, super important documents that you write to an M-disc.
[2656.12 → 2658.12] Yeah, M-disc I've been kind of sold on.
[2658.12 → 2661.12] M-disc is kind of amazing, but then the capacities aren't that high.
[2661.12 → 2662.12] Because it's only DVD.
[2662.12 → 2663.12] Yeah.
[2663.12 → 2667.12] So use like backup hard drives for just like pictures.
[2667.12 → 2668.12] Everything.
[2668.12 → 2671.12] And yeah, like hard drives for like movies and everything else.
[2671.12 → 2672.12] Yeah.
[2672.12 → 2676.12] So M-disc is like precious family photos or like your will.
[2676.12 → 2679.12] Baby pictures, wedding pictures, other very important things.
[2679.12 → 2680.12] Yeah.
[2680.12 → 2682.12] Super important documents like you said, will, stuff like that.
[2682.12 → 2686.12] But other than that, just go back up hard drives.
[2686.12 → 2688.12] Don't burn to Blu-rays.
[2688.12 → 2692.12] And like people think of it in terms of the transactional price I think sometimes.
[2692.12 → 2694.12] Because I've had people make the DVD archiving argument.
[2694.12 → 2696.12] And they're like, oh well DVD's only a couple cents.
[2696.12 → 2697.12] And I'm like, okay.
[2697.12 → 2699.12] It only holds four gigs.
[2699.12 → 2700.12] So you've got like...
[2700.12 → 2702.12] And how much is your time worth?
[2702.12 → 2707.12] I don't want to sit there burning...
[2707.12 → 2710.12] Like you said, 80 Blu-rays.
[2710.12 → 2718.12] And then it's not even, it's not even easy to like figure out what you've now written to that disc.
[2718.12 → 2719.12] And which disc has...
[2719.12 → 2720.12] Because okay, think about it this way.
[2720.12 → 2724.12] If you're like, wedding video, part one, two, three.
[2724.12 → 2727.12] Did you burn them in chronological order?
[2727.12 → 2730.12] Did you burn them in alphabetical order?
[2730.12 → 2736.12] Did you burn like the pictures of the hot bridesmaids on the one over there so that your wife wouldn't see it?
[2736.12 → 2737.12] Like, I don't know.
[2737.12 → 2739.12] Is she watching this you think?
[2739.12 → 2742.12] It's probably okay.
[2742.12 → 2743.12] I have no idea.
[2743.12 → 2745.12] She used to watch them.
[2745.12 → 2747.12] Now I think she got bored with them.
[2747.12 → 2748.12] I mean it's tech stuff.
[2748.12 → 2749.12] What does she care?
[2749.12 → 2750.12] Right, right.
[2750.12 → 2752.12] What other topics do you have?
[2752.12 → 2753.12] Oh yeah.
[2753.12 → 2755.12] Like, okay, here's another one.
[2755.12 → 2759.12] Why do you bother updating a phone like Notepad app?
[2759.12 → 2761.12] Why do you bother writing a special Notepad app?
[2761.12 → 2763.12] Let's talk about Slick's phone.
[2763.12 → 2766.12] Because he loves his phone so buggy much.
[2766.12 → 2768.12] Tell me about Note.
[2768.12 → 2769.12] I hate Note.
[2769.12 → 2770.12] I know.
[2770.12 → 2771.12] I have a perfect note app though.
[2771.12 → 2772.12] Tell me all about Note.
[2772.12 → 2773.12] I want to hear about Note.
[2773.12 → 2776.12] Why did Samsung write a Notepad application?
[2776.12 → 2779.12] Why did Samsung write any of the applications on that phone?
[2779.12 → 2780.12] Be nice.
[2780.12 → 2781.12] I, uh...
[2781.12 → 2784.12] Okay, you tried to use Note for what?
[2784.12 → 2785.12] A couple of weeks?
[2785.12 → 2786.12] Yeah, I was, okay, so...
[2786.12 → 2790.12] Oh, did you know that the memo pad that comes on the iPhone works really well?
[2790.12 → 2792.12] Ha ha, shut up.
[2792.12 → 2793.12] Um...
[2793.12 → 2794.12] Not a lot of functionality.
[2794.12 → 2795.12] Just text input, but...
[2795.12 → 2796.12] Well, that's what I wanted.
[2796.12 → 2797.12] Okay, to be honest...
[2797.12 → 2798.12] Okay, why did you start using Note?
[2798.12 → 2799.12] Here we go.
[2799.12 → 2801.12] Start using Note for the live streams.
[2801.12 → 2805.12] If you guys see me or Laius when we're on the streams, if we're ever looking at our phones,
[2805.12 → 2807.12] it's because we have certain people watching the audience that are...
[2807.12 → 2811.12] It's because we're not interested in talking to you people, so you're just like, no, no.
[2811.12 → 2815.12] There's certain people that are in the audience that have our phone numbers that will text us if things are going wrong, like audio.
[2815.12 → 2816.12] Really?
[2816.12 → 2817.12] Yeah, okay, I do.
[2817.12 → 2820.12] Maybe your friends don't care as much, but...
[2820.12 → 2822.12] I don't have any friends, that's the issue.
[2822.12 → 2824.12] That's unfortunate.
[2824.12 → 2826.12] Anyway, text me if there's audio problems.
[2826.12 → 2833.12] That's why I jump up sometimes, I'll hear my phone buzz, and then just like dart over and see if one of my buddies is texting me saying there's an audio problem or something.
[2833.12 → 2836.12] And because we keep our notes there.
[2836.12 → 2840.12] I'm looking at pictures of the baby that got sent to me throughout the day.
[2840.12 → 2841.12] He's eating green beans.
[2841.12 → 2842.12] It's pretty cute.
[2842.12 → 2843.12] Sorry, carry on.
[2843.12 → 2847.12] We keep our notes there for the livestreams, so we try and think of topics.
[2847.12 → 2849.12] So I was trying to use S-Note.
[2849.12 → 2851.12] Man, that was frustrating.
[2851.12 → 2857.12] If I did the slightest thing wrong, so it would go to a different tab within S-Note or anything,
[2857.12 → 2863.12] like if I clicked on anything that wasn't proper, it would move away from the stuff that I was currently typing and just delete everything.
[2863.12 → 2865.12] Oh my god.
[2865.12 → 2872.12] So we'd be on a really long car ride somewhere, and I'd be documenting all this stuff we're thinking of and Googling up topics that we can hopefully talk about
[2872.12 → 2874.12] so the livestream isn't boring as all hell.
[2874.12 → 2880.12] And then I've got a bunch of stuff and I walk out of the car and like just sleep my phone and put it in my pocket.
[2880.12 → 2882.12] Go to open it up later, and it's just like, whoa.
[2882.12 → 2883.12] Nope.
[2883.12 → 2884.12] All your lines are removed.
[2884.12 → 2886.12] The app is still open, but all your lines are removed.
[2886.12 → 2888.12] I'm just like, ah, why?
[2888.12 → 2892.12] So I ended up downloading some random app.
[2892.12 → 2893.12] I don't even know what it's called.
[2893.12 → 2895.12] It's called like Simple Note or something.
[2895.12 → 2901.12] And it's literally just a white screen and like a list of the documents that you have, and you just like click on them.
[2901.12 → 2906.12] And then it brings up just a white screen again, and then you can just like type wherever you want.
[2906.12 → 2908.12] And it's like, that's exactly what I wanted.
[2908.12 → 2912.12] All I wanted was a mirror of the Notepad app for PC.
[2912.12 → 2914.12] That's all I wanted.
[2914.12 → 2921.12] But they had to add all this additional functionality which barely works, and then the whole app barely works because everything else barely works.
[2921.12 → 2922.12] Just ugh.
[2922.12 → 2925.12] We have to do our Windows 8 giveaway.
[2925.12 → 2929.12] So you had a question that you wanted to use as our trivia.
[2929.12 → 2935.12] So I'm going to brief them on who's sponsoring the giveaway in the meantime while you go remember what it was.
[2935.12 → 2936.12] Okay, one second.
[2936.12 → 2941.12] Okay, so guys, the Windows 8 giveaway is sponsored by Timmy Tech TV.
[2941.12 → 2948.12] So we're going to go ahead and go to Timmy Tech TV's YouTube channel.
[2948.12 → 2952.12] And I'm going to try to freaking get this going.
[2952.12 → 2958.12] Alright, YouTubes.com slash.
[2958.12 → 2960.12] I can't find the slash on this keyboard.
[2960.12 → 2963.12] I've had a lot of people ask me what keyboard this is.
[2963.12 → 2965.12] And it's some ASIA one.
[2965.12 → 2966.12] I actually don't remember.
[2966.12 → 2969.12] It's KB178RT.
[2969.12 → 2971.12] KB178RT.
[2971.12 → 2976.12] It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it works.
[2976.12 → 2981.12] And it kind of gets the job done.
[2981.12 → 2983.12] And we, oh, oh really?
[2983.12 → 2985.12] No, I don't want to stay on this page.
[2985.12 → 2986.12] Go away.
[2986.12 → 2987.12] What is this?
[2987.12 → 2994.12] Oh man, British Columbia mom makes $7,000 a month, and you won't believe how she does it.
[2994.12 → 2997.12] And it's not letting me leave.
[2997.12 → 2998.12] There we go.
[2998.12 → 2999.12] Leave.
[2999.12 → 3002.12] Not sponsored by that.
[3002.12 → 3003.12] Sorry for that, guys.
[3003.12 → 3005.12] Timmy Tech TV.
[3005.12 → 3006.12] There we go.
[3006.12 → 3008.12] Timmy Tech TV channel.
[3008.12 → 3013.12] So he has sponsored us four copies of, oh, look at that.
[3013.12 → 3015.12] He featured my channels on his channel.
[3015.12 → 3016.12] That was nice of him.
[3016.12 → 3021.12] He sponsored me four copies of Windows 8 to give away on the next four live streams.
[3021.12 → 3023.12] So, oh, another thing, guys.
[3023.12 → 3030.12] There won't be a live stream next week because next week we will be in Vegas if we manage to stream something on Friday.
[3030.12 → 3031.12] And, oh, no, no.
[3031.12 → 3033.12] By Friday night we'll be on a plane, Slick.
[3033.12 → 3035.12] Yeah, not going to happen.
[3035.12 → 3038.12] We can't do a live stream while we're there.
[3038.12 → 3040.12] Yeah, that's not feasible.
[3040.12 → 3041.12] He's giving me that look.
[3041.12 → 3043.12] Like, he really wants to live stream while we're there.
[3043.12 → 3044.12] When will we be back?
[3044.12 → 3045.12] I'm sorry?
[3045.12 → 3046.12] When will we be back?
[3046.12 → 3048.12] Oh, we're not live-streaming the night we get back from CES.
[3048.12 → 3055.12] If I can get everything set up, I'll drag him into a chair.
[3055.12 → 3057.12] But there are no promises.
[3057.12 → 3059.12] I might look like this in the chair.
[3059.12 → 3062.12] Welcome to the live stream.
[3062.12 → 3063.12] I will try, guys.
[3063.12 → 3066.12] I will try, but there are no promises.
[3066.12 → 3070.12] So, anyway, have you managed to figure this out yet?
[3070.12 → 3075.12] How do you watch ASPIRE Star Wars on Windows?
[3075.12 → 3076.12] Well, okay.
[3076.12 → 3085.12] Okay, guys, so the first one to tweet, the correct answer, 100%, letter for letter, perfectly.
[3085.12 → 3091.12] The correct answer to Slick's question here is the winner.
[3091.12 → 3100.12] So, I'm going to go ahead, and we're going to fire up Twitter and here we go.
[3100.12 → 3101.12] Slick, come back.
[3101.12 → 3102.12] Ask your question.
[3102.12 → 3105.12] How do you watch ASCII Star Wars on Windows?
[3109.12 → 3114.12] And we're looking for, like, the legit way to do it, not, like, going on YouTube and searching for ASCII Star Wars.
[3114.12 → 3117.12] Yeah, like, how do you do it?
[3117.12 → 3118.12] Like, you can do this offline.
[3118.12 → 3120.12] Like, how do you...?
[3120.12 → 3122.12] Like, the whole thing?
[3122.12 → 3123.12] It's...
[3123.12 → 3124.12] It's...
[3124.12 → 3125.12] Seriously?
[3125.12 → 3126.12] Okay, let's see.
[3126.12 → 3127.12] So, the first one.
[3127.12 → 3128.12] The first one.
[3128.12 → 3129.12] Oh, hold on.
[3129.12 → 3131.12] We have at least one correct answer.
[3131.12 → 3132.12] Never mind.
[3132.12 → 3133.12] You can actually...
[3133.12 → 3134.12] You have to be online.
[3134.12 → 3135.12] Okay, you have to be online.
[3135.12 → 3136.12] Fine.
[3136.12 → 3137.12] But, like, that's not the point.
[3137.12 → 3138.12] That's not what I'm trying to prove.
[3138.12 → 3139.12] Like, you don't have to open a browser.
[3139.12 → 3140.12] There we go.
[3140.12 → 3141.12] Okay, here we go.
[3141.12 → 3142.12] So, wow.
[3142.12 → 3143.12] Bam.
[3143.12 → 3146.12] Kevin knew the answer.
[3146.12 → 3148.12] I did not think that would be that easy.
[3148.12 → 3154.12] Okay, Kevin, I am going to follow you on Twitter so that you can private message me.
[3154.12 → 3155.12] Private message me.
[3155.12 → 3158.12] You are getting a free copy of Windows 8.
[3158.12 → 3159.12] Congratulations.
[3159.12 → 3162.12] TimmyTechTV is going to send that to you.
[3162.12 → 3164.12] And you should be super thrilled.
[3164.12 → 3165.12] Because...
[3165.12 → 3166.12] Does it work in Windows 8 as well?
[3166.12 → 3167.12] Apparently.
[3167.12 → 3168.12] Alright.
[3168.12 → 3173.12] So you can go watch your ASCII Star Wars and your brand-new copy of Windows 8.
[3173.12 → 3175.12] Thanks, guys, for participating.
[3175.12 → 3179.12] And I hope you found it to be a little bit more organized this week compared to last...
[3179.12 → 3181.12] Oh, last week was a disaster.
[3181.12 → 3182.12] Did you watch it?
[3182.12 → 3183.12] I ended up watching, yeah.
[3183.12 → 3184.12] It was terrible.
[3184.12 → 3185.12] I just...
[3185.12 → 3186.12] I don't blame you, though.
[3186.12 → 3187.12] But, like...
[3187.12 → 3188.12] It was bad.
[3188.12 → 3189.12] I...
[3189.12 → 3190.12] Well, okay.
[3190.12 → 3191.12] That's why I tried to pick something more structured.
[3191.12 → 3194.12] You knew what a long day I'd had that day already.
[3194.12 → 3200.12] Plus, I think you have a better understanding now of how much I'm able to sleep at night.
[3200.12 → 3206.12] Between my cat and my baby, it is a miracle that I get any rest at all.
[3206.12 → 3208.12] It's helped the forum, but...
[3208.12 → 3209.12] Yeah.
[3209.12 → 3210.12] Yeah.
[3210.12 → 3212.12] Yeah, it's helped the forum, indeed.
[3212.12 → 3214.12] Okay, here we go.
[3214.12 → 3217.12] Sound card and headset for 7.1 gaming.
[3217.12 → 3222.12] First, get a proper headphone or headset with two speakers in it.
[3222.12 → 3223.12] Agreed?
[3223.12 → 3224.12] Yep.
[3224.12 → 3225.12] 100%.
[3225.12 → 3226.12] 100% agreed.
[3226.12 → 3230.12] Find some sound card that does some cheese ball surround effect if you really want that.
[3230.12 → 3231.12] It will be better.
[3231.12 → 3233.12] It will honestly sound better.
[3233.12 → 3240.12] I have owned both, and actual 7.1 doesn't sound as good as perfect, high-quality
[3240.12 → 3241.12] headphones...
[3241.12 → 3242.12] With software trickery.
[3242.12 → 3243.12] Simulating surround.
[3243.12 → 3245.12] Software trickery is where it's at, guys.
[3245.12 → 3247.12] Remember, guys, two ears.
[3247.12 → 3249.12] Two speakers is all you need.
[3249.12 → 3252.12] And I know that question was Google-able, but pretty much any question that we're going
[3252.12 → 3255.12] to be able to come up with is going to be Google-able.
[3255.12 → 3258.12] And the people that answered were really quick.
[3258.12 → 3260.12] Yeah, they were fast enough that they probably knew.
[3260.12 → 3261.12] They probably just knew it.
[3261.12 → 3265.12] And you'll always be at an advantage if you actually know the answer, which is great.
[3265.12 → 3266.12] Yeah, kind of the point.
[3266.12 → 3270.12] Guys, actually, oh, have you seen that virtual haircut thing?
[3270.12 → 3271.12] No.
[3271.12 → 3272.12] No.
[3272.12 → 3273.12] Okay.
[3273.12 → 3276.12] Mandatory assignment here, guys.
[3276.12 → 3279.12] Everyone needs to...
[3279.12 → 3283.12] After the livestream, of course you need to stay and watch us first.
[3283.12 → 3287.12] Search for virtual barbershop.
[3287.12 → 3288.12] This is...
[3288.12 → 3289.12] I recognise this.
[3289.12 → 3290.12] Maybe I have.
[3290.12 → 3292.12] This is all the evidence you need.
[3292.12 → 3293.12] There it is.
[3293.12 → 3294.12] Use headphones.
[3294.12 → 3296.12] Close your eyes and you basically...
[3296.12 → 3297.12] Oh, yeah.
[3297.12 → 3298.12] I have heard of this.
[3298.12 → 3299.12] Yes, definitely.
[3299.12 → 3300.12] It sounds like you're getting a haircut.
[3300.12 → 3307.12] If you needed evidence that you only have two ears, and you only need two speakers, that
[3307.12 → 3308.12] is it.
[3308.12 → 3309.12] So, there you go.
[3309.12 → 3314.12] If you're in a home theatre setting, 7.1 is awesome.
[3314.12 → 3318.12] When the speakers are directly covering your entire ear, it's...
[3318.12 → 3320.12] It's so cool, though.
[3320.12 → 3321.12] Okay, have you tried it?
[3321.12 → 3322.12] Oh, yeah, definitely.
[3322.12 → 3323.12] I thought you were talking about something.
[3323.12 → 3324.12] No, no, no, no.
[3324.12 → 3325.12] I was just talking about that.
[3325.12 → 3326.12] I didn't know you were still on the audio topic.
[3326.12 → 3327.12] No, it's so freaking cool.
[3327.12 → 3328.12] Yeah, I know.
[3328.12 → 3329.12] It's awesome.
[3329.12 → 3330.12] Definitely.
[3330.12 → 3331.12] It's the best thing ever.
[3331.12 → 3332.12] You should definitely go watch it.
[3332.12 → 3333.12] Listen to it.
[3333.12 → 3334.12] What do we get?
[3334.12 → 3335.12] MS-DOS also.
[3335.12 → 3336.12] Apparently, it works in MS-DOS as well.
[3336.12 → 3337.12] Cool.
[3337.12 → 3339.12] Yeah, it works in tons of stuff.
[3339.12 → 3342.12] I think it might work on Linux as well.
[3342.12 → 3343.12] Don't quote me on that.
[3343.12 → 3344.12] Okay.
[3344.12 → 3345.12] Got a bunch of answers here.
[3345.12 → 3346.12] Okay.
[3346.12 → 3351.12] Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[3351.12 → 3354.12] We have one guy who answered Star Wars.
[3354.12 → 3358.12] Well, yes, that would be a way to watch Star Wars on Windows.
[3358.12 → 3359.12] Very carefully.
[3359.12 → 3360.12] Yeah.
[3360.12 → 3361.12] Yeah!
[3361.12 → 3364.12] Oh, no.
[3364.12 → 3365.12] Offline mode in Safari, apparently.
[3365.12 → 3369.12] I don't know how many people install Safari on their Windows machines.
[3369.12 → 3370.12] No, it, no, yeah.
[3370.12 → 3371.12] I do.
[3371.12 → 3372.12] Download on iTunes and play through QuickTime.
[3372.12 → 3373.12] Justin, you're fired.
[3373.12 → 3374.12] I like it though.
[3374.12 → 3375.12] Buy a CD.
[3375.12 → 3376.12] It wasn't the point, guys.
[3376.12 → 3377.12] She's Windows Media Player.
[3377.12 → 3378.12] She's Windows Media Player.
[3378.12 → 3380.12] These guys are like trying to legit answer like the question.
[3380.12 → 3382.12] And it's like, no, no, it's, it's a trick.
[3382.12 → 3383.12] It's like a trick question.
[3383.12 → 3386.12] I didn't want to say it was a command line input.
[3386.12 → 3387.12] Yeah.
[3387.12 → 3389.12] Cause that's like, yeah, that's too obvious.
[3389.12 → 3390.12] Yeah.
[3390.12 → 3394.12] Because you could just say like, I wanted the Google search to be at least not like the
[3394.12 → 3396.12] What if You Needed 002T.'d0 A306 Okay, to a handle tends to run via my Google presence from
[3396.12 → 3399.12] January 1, animus of the computer's Zoom chipping.
[3399.12 → 3400.12] When I can check someplace generator, that'd be the Interneticher니다.
[3400.12 → 3401.12] PRA, an animus Host.
[3401.12 → 3417.82] I snap you into theirs the interface Ford mouse to connect through QuickTime, and
[3417.82 → 3419.12] the Internet, and go on to Anyway mode?
[3419.12 → 3420.12] Them.
[3420.12 → 3423.12] They turn the iPad parties on screen.
[3423.12 → 3429.96] slick is so hot, and I think Julie isn't the only girl who actually thinks so.
[3429.96 → 3438.36] No, don't. Continue onwards, keep going. I will hurt you. Just keep going.
[3438.36 → 3442.12] Just keep going. Keep going.
[3442.12 → 3454.60] Okay, okay, okay, we're moving on. Big NVIDIA announcement at CES. Okay, I'm kind of curious
[3454.60 → 3461.32] about this. Deacon usually tweets pretty good stuff. Live from Las Vegas. How to tune into
[3461.32 → 3466.32] NVIDIA's news. Oh, we're missing this. We're not going to be there in time. So whatever's,
[3466.32 → 3473.60] yeah, we're going down on, oh wait, what, Sunday? No, it's during the day Sunday. We don't
[3473.60 → 3480.54] arrive until Sunday night. So yeah, we're missing it. There's like a live show. It's like a big
[3480.54 → 3487.96] event. I'll watch it then. I have no idea what they're talking about, but it should be pretty
[3487.96 → 3491.56] cool. Maybe it's the there are things coming out of bed. No, it's probably a lot bigger than
[3491.56 → 3494.96] that. Yeah, the GeForce experience is cool, but I don't think this is going to be it. It's
[3494.96 → 3497.82] probably a lot bigger than that. Yeah, they're making like a huge deal out of this.
[3498.50 → 3505.68] What case, 300R or 692 Advanced? Did I say 600R? Because I meant to say 300R. Yeah, I saw
[3505.68 → 3511.64] that. I don't know. I'd go 300R, I think. Yeah, I probably would too. Just the more,
[3511.64 → 3520.22] the more modern feature set just is a good thing. I've built in the 300R more. Yeah. Which
[3520.22 → 3525.50] gives it kind of unfair advantage because I kind of know it. I only did a 692 Advanced
[3525.50 → 3529.24] build a long time ago, but it's a good case. I haven't built in one. Furthermore, I've just seen it. Oh,
[3529.32 → 3533.60] really? Yeah. No, it's perfect. Like it's easy to build in. Everything's really intuitive.
[3533.74 → 3538.40] Cooler Master does such a good job of that. No, I know. I know. Just I've built in the 300R a lot.
[3538.52 → 3541.70] I haven't built in the other one. So that's why I didn't actually ever give a suggestion,
[3541.90 → 3544.88] but I kind of would just lean towards that one because that's the only one I have personal
[3544.88 → 3554.92] experience with. Slick looks familiar. Hey, you could easily be like a mesh between these two guys
[3554.92 → 3564.50] and this one. Need a haircut. Well, yes. I might need a touch up before we go as well.
[3564.50 → 3573.08] I'm like, I was, you can't, you can ask my roommate. I'm like, I was planning to get a haircut literally
[3573.08 → 3577.48] like three months ago. It just never happened. Chris Berry wins all the Internets. We have to
[3577.48 → 3581.86] take the Internets away from whoever won it last time because that is the most creative spelling
[3581.86 → 3589.82] of Wednesday I have ever seen. There's even a space. It's not capitalized. Like, let's try to find
[3589.82 → 3594.74] how many things are wrong with this. It's not capitalized. There's a space. There's a space.
[3595.20 → 3601.88] The D and the N. The D and the N are reversed. There's a missing E. There's a missing E. Okay.
[3603.32 → 3610.28] It has like 15 exclamation marks. The sentence isn't capitalized. You don't need a like there.
[3611.86 → 3618.86] Okay. Yay, Chris. We love you, man. Welcome to the internet.
[3619.82 → 3624.54] I have, what's Bias's infinite drive? I'm not familiar with that, unfortunately.
[3625.24 → 3626.92] Maybe we should look into that after. Sure.
[3629.90 → 3633.72] Blu-ray burners. For giving others huge amounts of data without giving them a whole hard drive.
[3634.48 → 3640.68] And BDXL is 125 gigs. Okay. But how much does a BDXL cost? So that still holds with sort of what
[3640.68 → 3646.74] we're saying. And if I ever give people huge amounts of data, it's usually not like here,
[3646.74 → 3650.86] archive this. It's usually like here, take this really quickly. And I would use...
[3650.86 → 3652.00] I was going there.
[3652.24 → 3652.68] Yeah.
[3654.30 → 3659.34] I would use a flash drive, man. I would use a flash drive, or I would like FTP it to them.
[3659.42 → 3659.54] Yeah.
[3659.54 → 3661.22] Or I would use a Dropbox system.
[3661.22 → 3667.56] So for the cost of your Blu-ray discs to match that 2TB capacity, you could buy your 2TB hard
[3667.56 → 3671.40] drive and a big fat USB drive. And they're rewritable!
[3672.98 → 3673.80] Again, yeah.
[3674.48 → 3678.96] And you could get like a baller one like this that's impossible to destroy, Survivor Stealth,
[3679.10 → 3679.66] for the win.
[3679.80 → 3680.42] They're pretty epic.
[3680.70 → 3680.82] Yeah.
[3680.82 → 3685.24] But like, I understand he's trying to play Devil's Advocate, he's trying to like to spur the
[3685.24 → 3687.18] conversation, but I just still don't think it's feasible.
[3687.18 → 3692.42] What summoner name do you play and what region do you play on? Shout out to Henry Pham!
[3694.72 → 3695.08] Yeah.
[3695.70 → 3701.98] I back up my Wii and PS2 games on the... Okay, yes, you can back up your games on... That's
[3701.98 → 3704.86] a legitimate reason to have... Well, sort of legitimate reason to have a burner.
[3705.30 → 3706.64] He's actually doing it.
[3706.90 → 3709.98] Hey, look at that. Look how the colour changes when I switch these. It's better on this one.
[3710.12 → 3711.08] See how yellow-y look?
[3711.24 → 3713.04] Because you can have different settings in the scenes.
[3713.16 → 3716.30] I know, but I think I must have messed up scene one. Well, we were in kind of a hurry in
[3716.30 → 3718.92] my defence. Yeah, whatever. At least it's working.
[3719.58 → 3724.48] I want to replace my... See, this is the problem that I have with the case guys who don't use
[3724.48 → 3730.04] standard fan sizes. And I mean, I know 200 mid and 160 mid and 180 mid and 230 mid. They're
[3730.04 → 3735.54] all kind of standard fan sizes. But I mean by standard, like, someone actually makes replacement
[3735.54 → 3736.30] fans for it.
[3736.54 → 3736.62] Yeah.
[3737.04 → 3741.24] Bit Phoenix is doing a good job of supporting the fan sizes that they generate.
[3741.40 → 3745.30] And Bit Phoenix fans look really cool. They're one of the few brands that like...
[3745.30 → 3745.92] They perform okay.
[3746.28 → 3746.78] Yeah, no, I know.
[3747.10 → 3748.40] Alchemy Pros are good fans.
[3748.46 → 3749.18] I'm not saying they don't.
[3749.30 → 3749.72] Oh, okay.
[3749.72 → 3755.28] Just like a lot of people like, I love Noctua fans, but look at them. And then put one beside
[3755.28 → 3760.54] a Bit Phoenix fan and just like get a 13-year-old kid to pick which one he thinks is cooler.
[3760.94 → 3761.30] Okay.
[3761.30 → 3763.22] Like the Bit Phoenix fans look awesome.
[3763.48 → 3767.44] By that lot... Okay, so what? I should make all the decisions in my life based on what
[3767.44 → 3768.58] 13-year-olds think are cool?
[3769.82 → 3773.58] Do you have any of those in your system? They're like your favourite fans. Do you have
[3773.58 → 3774.18] any of them in your system?
[3774.18 → 3775.18] No.
[3775.18 → 3776.18] No.
[3776.18 → 3777.18] No.
[3777.18 → 3778.18] No.
[3778.18 → 3779.18] But they're the best!
[3779.18 → 3780.18] Come on.
[3780.18 → 3781.18] You know they're...
[3781.18 → 3782.18] Come on.
[3782.18 → 3787.18] Why am I fisting bumping you? You just burned me. I shouldn't be acknowledging this at all.
[3787.18 → 3792.18] They just look atrocious. And like, okay, if you have...
[3792.18 → 3796.18] Okay, fine. I will put NFF-12s in the basement of my TJ07.
[3796.18 → 3798.18] In the basement. Keyword.
[3798.18 → 3800.18] Actually, I won't put them there.
[3800.18 → 3802.18] I knew you wouldn't because you're going to put Silverstone's, aren't you?
[3802.18 → 3804.18] Yeah, I have air penetrating. APs, yeah.
[3804.18 → 3805.18] APs, yeah.
[3805.18 → 3806.18] APs, yeah.
[3806.18 → 3810.18] There are... Okay. Okay, okay, fine. Here, let me put it this way then.
[3810.18 → 3814.18] If I was building a... Ooh.
[3814.18 → 3819.18] I was going to say, if I was building a machine that had a closed side panel, I'd use them,
[3819.18 → 3822.18] but my wife's machine does not use Noctua's.
[3822.18 → 3826.18] I have... I have a test bench with Noctua's on it.
[3826.18 → 3831.18] That's the point of the test bench though, isn't it?
[3831.18 → 3833.18] To perform really well.
[3833.18 → 3839.18] No, to report back sounds and stuff for fans. You're using a consolidated fan format.
[3839.18 → 3843.18] No, no, not that one. No, no, the other test bench. The one with the Cougar power supply.
[3843.18 → 3845.18] Oh, we never use that one.
[3845.18 → 3847.18] We do sometimes.
[3847.18 → 3848.18] We never use that one.
[3848.18 → 3851.18] It has P12s on it. We used it for months.
[3851.18 → 3854.18] We used that test bench almost exclusively for months.
[3854.18 → 3856.18] Because... No, not almost exclusively.
[3856.18 → 3858.18] Because I needed another test bench, and you said,
[3858.18 → 3862.18] here's a bunch of hardware build blend and I grabbed those fans.
[3862.18 → 3865.18] No, I changed... No, no, you don't remember.
[3865.18 → 3870.18] Because I changed them out when I was trying to do acoustic testing on video cards.
[3870.18 → 3871.18] Okay.
[3871.18 → 3877.18] I needed fans that could run near silent on the actual CPU cooler itself so that I could
[3877.18 → 3882.18] take sound readings from the video card on an overclocked CPU system without the CPU fans
[3882.18 → 3885.18] ramping up like crazy. They are the best fans.
[3885.18 → 3889.18] But you didn't care about the look of it because it was on a performance based test bench.
[3889.18 → 3896.18] But if it was a choice between these and ones that didn't perform well at all, I would go with these.
[3896.18 → 3902.18] Oh, of course. Yeah. No, I love Noctua fans. I just can't bring myself to install them on my system because they're ugly.
[3902.18 → 3904.18] But AP-121s are like...
[3904.18 → 3905.18] They look great, and they perform amazing.
[3905.18 → 3913.18] They're 90% as good. Gentle Typhoons are... you could argue as good, but I wouldn't run them at those kinds of RPMs.
[3913.18 → 3916.18] Yeah. So I would take a Noctua over Gentle Typhoons to be perfectly honest.
[3916.18 → 3919.18] Gentle Typhoons don't look that great, but I think they look better than them.
[3919.18 → 3923.18] Gelid wings aren't that great, but they're pretty good and they look perfect.
[3923.18 → 3924.18] And they look perfect.
[3924.18 → 3926.18] Yeah. UV blue in my system is like...
[3926.18 → 3928.18] Awesome. Yeah.
[3928.18 → 3935.18] Okay. There was someone I promised to do a...
[3935.18 → 3942.18] There was someone I promised to do a shoutout to this week and I have to go check.
[3942.18 → 3944.18] I don't know what to discuss.
[3944.18 → 3946.18] Twitter Q&A.
[3946.18 → 3947.18] Twitter Q&A.
[3947.18 → 3949.18] I forget how to do this. Wait.
[3949.18 → 3951.18] Ah! Noobs Can Play shoutout.
[3951.18 → 3954.18] Shoutout to Noobs Can Play. Peace, bro.
[3954.18 → 3960.18] Linus, why did you get a No Record found?
[3960.18 → 3961.18] Um...
[3961.18 → 3962.18] Uh...
[3962.18 → 3963.18] Uh...
[3963.18 → 3968.18] We're not gonna talk about problems with the search function on NCX's website.
[3968.18 → 3969.18] Uh...
[3969.18 → 3971.18] Have you heard about...
[3971.18 → 3974.18] Linus, have you heard about Vortex-based video?
[3974.18 → 3975.18] No.
[3975.18 → 3977.18] No, I've never heard of this either.
[3977.18 → 3981.18] I use my iPhone Notes app all the time.
[3981.18 → 3987.18] That's one thing I do have a problem with is the Notes app on iOS products is kinda awesome.
[3987.18 → 3989.18] And I have a lot of problems with the one on my Android.
[3989.18 → 3992.18] But then, like I said, I downloaded a new one, which is an awesome thing about Android,
[3992.18 → 3994.18] and then it totally solved the problem.
[3994.18 → 3995.18] Okay.
[3995.18 → 3998.18] We have another Samsung topic to discuss.
[3998.18 → 4000.18] The Evolution Kit.
[4000.18 → 4003.18] You mentioned this, but didn't go into detail.
[4003.18 → 4005.18] So this is some CES news.
[4005.18 → 4007.18] They first unveiled this last year.
[4007.18 → 4009.18] So the Evolution Kit...
[4009.18 → 4014.18] Get this.
[4014.18 → 4017.18] This face should give you some idea how stupid I think this is.
[4017.18 → 4019.18] I was already kinda like, uh...
[4019.18 → 4024.18] The Evolution Kit allows you to take your 2012 model Smart TV,
[4024.18 → 4028.18] and by adding a pack to the back of it,
[4028.18 → 4034.18] to meet the ongoing, you know, memory and processing and power requirements
[4034.18 → 4039.18] of Smart TVs and the media and everything that's happening.
[4039.18 → 4045.18] You can upgrade your 2012 Smart TV to the 2013 version by putting this pack on the back.
[4045.18 → 4052.18] I feel like if I was in the store I would buy it just so you would go away.
[4052.18 → 4055.18] Just go away.
[4055.18 → 4059.18] So you get the latest suite of applications, you get...
[4059.18 → 4061.18] Why do you need a pack for applications?
[4061.18 → 4065.18] Well this is the first question that I was sort of thinking.
[4065.18 → 4066.18] Oh, okay. Continue. Sorry.
[4066.18 → 4067.18] Well I guess, actually no.
[4067.18 → 4070.18] My first question is why do you need a Smart TV at all?
[4070.18 → 4073.18] Why don't you buy a PIVOT AOS and hook it up to your TV?
[4073.18 → 4075.18] And then you'll get firmware updates for free.
[4075.18 → 4076.18] Oh, 100%.
[4076.18 → 4078.18] And I've heard a lot of problems with the gestures.
[4078.18 → 4079.18] Okay.
[4079.18 → 4080.18] Tons of problems with the gestures.
[4080.18 → 4082.18] Do you remember that Samsung all-in-one that we had?
[4082.18 → 4083.18] Yeah.
[4083.18 → 4084.18] That we did an unboxing of?
[4084.18 → 4085.18] Yeah.
[4085.18 → 4086.18] I tried to demo the gesture thing.
[4086.18 → 4088.18] I didn't get a single bit of usable footage.
[4088.18 → 4089.18] It just doesn't work.
[4089.18 → 4094.18] And the gestures on the TV at the keynote at the Samsung Canada thing,
[4094.18 → 4097.18] the guy on stage was trying to demo it, and it didn't work at all.
[4097.18 → 4101.18] Gestures are going to be incredible when they work really well.
[4101.18 → 4102.18] But we're not there yet.
[4102.18 → 4103.18] Here's the thing.
[4103.18 → 4109.18] To actually build in the hardware that would be required to properly map the human body,
[4109.18 → 4113.18] in any kind of remotely reasonable real time.
[4113.18 → 4116.18] And I'm not talking to connect with like, you know, a half second delay.
[4116.18 → 4117.18] Okay.
[4117.18 → 4121.18] It's not a half second, but with any kind of lag or any kind of ambiguity as to what you're
[4121.18 → 4124.18] doing for it to actually work perfectly so that it can recognise you, whether you're
[4124.18 → 4130.18] standing like this or whether you're like, you know, on the couch like this.
[4130.18 → 4133.18] I mean, it would basically need a computer in it.
[4133.18 → 4138.18] And like, there are a lot of little companies and some bigger companies making some fascinating
[4138.18 → 4142.18] hand gesture programs for computer and stuff, but there are still tons of problems with them.
[4142.18 → 4143.18] Tons of problems.
[4143.18 → 4146.18] I mean, the closest I think will be is like a glove.
[4146.18 → 4150.18] Have you seen that like weird, crazy multicoloured glove?
[4150.18 → 4152.18] No, I haven't seen that one.
[4152.18 → 4154.18] I can't remember what they're called, but it looks like you like spilled a whole
[4154.18 → 4155.18] much different coloured paints on a glove.
[4155.18 → 4156.18] Okay.
[4156.18 → 4159.18] And they wear them and the gestures you can do with them are insanely accurate.
[4159.18 → 4160.18] Okay.
[4160.18 → 4161.18] See something like that could work.
[4161.18 → 4168.18] And guys, please for the love of peanuts, stop asking us if we heard about the leap motion.
[4168.18 → 4170.18] Yes, we have heard about the leap motion.
[4170.18 → 4172.18] Yes, it's cool.
[4172.18 → 4174.18] It is not out yet.
[4174.18 → 4176.18] I cannot unbox it yet.
[4176.18 → 4178.18] I have been in touch with them.
[4178.18 → 4182.18] We're going to arrange to get something going once they actually have units that they
[4182.18 → 4183.18] can ship.
[4183.18 → 4186.18] But yeah, I'm super excited about it.
[4186.18 → 4191.18] I think this could be bridging the gap between the touch screen interface and the totally
[4191.18 → 4192.18] not touch screen.
[4192.18 → 4196.18] You know, for those folks who don't want to touch their screen, for folks who are too far
[4196.18 → 4200.18] away from their monitor and this is uncomfortable, they could still go up and go like this.
[4200.18 → 4202.18] If it works, then like awesome.
[4202.18 → 4203.18] It should be really cool.
[4203.18 → 4207.18] Otherwise, you know, we'll all forget about it at some point.
[4207.18 → 4210.18] Uh, go to the Lemon.
[4210.18 → 4214.18] Apparently, S-Node is perfect on Note 2 because of S-Pen support.
[4214.18 → 4219.18] That's kind of cool to hear, but it doesn't help all the incredible amount of S3 owners.
[4219.18 → 4223.18] Which, by the way, is more than any other smartphone ever.
[4223.18 → 4224.18] Bam.
[4224.18 → 4229.18] So like, that's awesome, and I'm happy it works good for you and S-Pen is pretty cool, but
[4229.18 → 4231.18] like, there's a billion of us.
[4231.18 → 4232.18] Maybe more than that.
[4232.18 → 4234.18] I was trying to just pick a huge number.
[4234.18 → 4235.18] Oh, that's a good idea.
[4235.18 → 4238.18] Do you think it's the transparent OLED display they were showing a while back?
[4238.18 → 4241.18] No, because if they've shown it before, I kind of doubt it.
[4241.18 → 4247.18] Yeah, because they're talking about like whole new design and like shape of the TV and stuff.
[4247.18 → 4250.18] So unless they took that and shaped it differently.
[4250.18 → 4256.18] Um, I am building an X79 rig now and Slick runs a Z77 rig now.
[4256.18 → 4261.18] So I guess both of us will be waiting for the next chipset before we make any upgrades.
[4261.18 → 4264.18] I use Blu-ray for backing up my Blu-ray movies.
[4264.18 → 4267.18] No, you should use a hard drive for backing up your Blu-ray movies.
[4270.18 → 4271.18] Okay.
[4271.18 → 4272.18] Whoa.
[4272.18 → 4273.18] That's a lot of work.
[4273.18 → 4275.18] Sorry, if you tweet that many times I'm going to have to skip over.
[4275.18 → 4279.18] Yes, we are going to have an X40 and X60 in a review, comparison, and conclusion.
[4279.18 → 4280.18] We haven't had time.
[4280.18 → 4282.18] We're going to use the standardized test bench.
[4282.18 → 4287.18] I'm actually going to have to do some fancy Reeling to make the X60 fit in it.
[4287.18 → 4289.18] But that's okay, we're going to do it.
[4289.18 → 4292.18] So yeah, we will do that, but it'll be once we get back from CES.
[4292.18 → 4293.18] Pinyin.
[4293.18 → 4295.18] I am very sorry if I'm pronouncing your name wrong.
[4295.18 → 4296.18] Pinyin.
[4296.18 → 4297.18] Pinyin.
[4297.18 → 4298.18] Pinyin.
[4298.18 → 4299.18] Pinyin.
[4299.18 → 4300.18] Okay, Pinyin.
[4300.18 → 4301.18] Pinyin.
[4301.18 → 4302.18] Pinyin.
[4302.18 → 4303.18] I get it.
[4303.18 → 4304.18] Pinyin.
[4304.18 → 4306.18] You're going to do it again when I start talking, aren't you?
[4306.18 → 4307.18] Oh, okay.
[4307.18 → 4308.18] Pinyin.
[4308.18 → 4311.18] So, I don't know, probably not for an incredibly long time, but if you're interested in that
[4311.18 → 4314.18] kind of stuff, Google up Oculus Rift.
[4314.18 → 4317.18] It's the closest thing we're going to be getting in the near future.
[4317.18 → 4318.18] They're awesome.
[4318.18 → 4319.18] Look it up.
[4319.18 → 4320.18] What?
[4320.18 → 4322.18] You can pre-order them.
[4322.18 → 4325.18] What are you talking about?
[4325.18 → 4327.18] Which one easily dies?
[4327.18 → 4332.18] Sorry, those are totally, totally different things in every possible way.
[4332.18 → 4335.18] No, I wouldn't really recommend a GT 640.
[4335.18 → 4339.18] Anything under a hundred bucks for a graphics card is not a good value.
[4339.18 → 4341.18] And I don't mean it's not cheap.
[4341.18 → 4347.18] It is cheap, but it's not a good value because value is, I think of in terms of frames per
[4347.18 → 4348.18] second per dollar.
[4348.18 → 4353.18] I actually had someone giving me a really hard time on Twitter because I wouldn't recommend
[4353.18 → 4357.18] a GT or a GTX 650 to someone.
[4357.18 → 4361.18] And I was like, GTX 650 is not a good value.
[4361.18 → 4365.18] I said, and they were like, oh, Linus, not everyone, you know, blah, blah, blah, I can get the best card.
[4365.18 → 4369.18] And you guys are so focused on GTX 660 Ti's and 670's.
[4369.18 → 4373.18] I was like, well, no, actually it's, you can get a 650 Ti.
[4373.18 → 4379.18] But the difference in performance between a 650 and a 650 Ti is like this.
[4379.18 → 4381.18] And the difference in price is like this.
[4381.18 → 4386.18] Value is FPS per dollars, not just dollars.
[4386.18 → 4395.18] So a 640 is never a good value because it costs like 80% of what something way better costs,
[4395.18 → 4397.18] but it'll perform like half as well.
[4397.18 → 4398.18] So it's a terrible, terrible value.
[4398.18 → 4399.18] Never buy entry level video cards.
[4399.18 → 4402.18] You got to look into the price per performance curves.
[4402.18 → 4408.18] And like, if you're buying like a card like that, it's going to be obsolete so quick.
[4408.18 → 4409.18] Yeah.
[4409.18 → 4411.18] Do you know where I can buy modded cases?
[4411.18 → 4412.18] I don't know.
[4412.18 → 4415.18] No, I mod them myself.
[4415.18 → 4416.18] Buy a Drexel.
[4416.18 → 4422.18] And some like panels from Home Depot or wherever you buy.
[4422.18 → 4423.18] Okay.
[4423.18 → 4424.18] Home Depot stuff.
[4424.18 → 4426.18] Well, I think that wraps it up for now.
[4426.18 → 4429.18] Thank you guys for tuning into our shortened live stream.
[4429.18 → 4432.18] Hopefully two weeks from now when we do the next live stream,
[4432.18 → 4437.18] you guys will be able to tune in on time because we'll be like ready.
[4437.18 → 4439.18] And I'm sure we'll have tons more topics.
[4439.18 → 4444.18] It's been kind of dead lately because everyone's just kind of calm before the storming because of CES.
[4444.18 → 4445.18] Yeah.
[4445.18 → 4448.18] So we're going to have way, way too much stuff to talk about.
[4448.18 → 4449.18] Yeah.
[4449.18 → 4450.18] Instead of just like random topics.
[4450.18 → 4452.18] We might have to do like a deluxe, like longer live stream or something.
[4452.18 → 4456.18] Maybe we'll talk about it in the, in the cool down from CES.
[4456.18 → 4458.18] We'll plan like one, like a debriefing.
[4458.18 → 4462.18] Maybe we do like a three or five hour live stream or something like that.
[4462.18 → 4467.18] As long as we get a huge list of comments, I mean topics and people are willing to come around, I'm cool with it.
[4467.18 → 4468.18] Yep.
[4468.18 → 4469.18] Okay.
[4469.18 → 4470.18] All right.
[4470.18 → 4471.18] Good night guys.
[4471.18 → 4472.18] Thanks for tuning in.
