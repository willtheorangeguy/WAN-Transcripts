[0.00 → 23.30] Are we live?
[23.30 → 25.00] Is this working?
[25.00 → 27.00] Hello everybody!
[27.00 → 31.00] Welcome to the live show that I promised.
[31.00 → 37.00] I really hope the mic is working okay because it's been really irritating me.
[37.00 → 41.00] So we've run through some of the different problems that we've had.
[41.00 → 43.00] I'm quiet?
[43.00 → 46.00] Okay, I can fix quiet actually, believe it or not.
[46.00 → 48.00] I can do that okay.
[48.00 → 49.00] So I'm going to turn it up.
[49.00 → 50.00] I'm turning it up now.
[50.00 → 53.00] In fact, here, I'll even show you guys how I'm turning it up.
[53.00 → 56.00] So I'm going to turn it up right in here.
[56.00 → 57.00] See?
[57.00 → 64.00] So I tried this Steel Series USB sound card that seemed to be fixing some of the issues.
[64.00 → 66.00] And then it didn't fix other issues.
[66.00 → 70.00] And I'm going to turn it up just a little bit because some of you are saying you don't want
[70.00 → 71.00] it up that high.
[71.00 → 72.00] So there we go.
[72.00 → 73.00] Good evening everybody.
[73.00 → 76.00] And we've got a fantastic show for you.
[76.00 → 77.00] Actually, we don't really have a show at all.
[77.00 → 82.00] We just have me sort of sitting here and hopefully taking some questions.
[82.00 → 87.00] Although I do want to start with something that is on everybody's mind.
[87.00 → 89.00] So...
[89.00 → 93.00] Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun...
[93.00 → 95.00] iPhone 5!
[95.00 → 97.00] What do you guys think of this?
[97.00 → 98.00] Go ahead.
[98.00 → 99.00] You can use the Twitch chat.
[99.00 → 100.00] You can use Twitter.
[100.00 → 103.00] So we're going to go ahead and add another...
[103.00 → 104.00] Actually, no.
[104.00 → 107.00] We're not going to add anything right now.
[107.00 → 109.00] So I want to know what you guys think.
[109.00 → 110.00] I'm going to let you know what I think.
[110.00 → 118.00] So what I think is that basically I don't understand any reason why anyone who owns an Apple phone
[118.00 → 123.00] is upgrading from a 4 or a 4S to this phone because it looks like what we're dealing with
[123.00 → 126.00] is a phone that is basically a little bit...
[126.00 → 132.00] See, this to me is a lot like the iPad 1 to iPad 2 upgrade because what we're getting
[132.00 → 139.00] is a slightly thinner device with...
[139.00 → 140.00] Um...
[143.00 → 148.00] Slightly less weight and we're getting basically a slightly longer screen.
[148.00 → 150.00] Although, although, that's actually one of the things I like.
[150.00 → 156.00] So compared to what I've seen from most people who are saying that they think it's phenomenally stupid
[156.00 → 159.00] that Apple has just enlarged the screen, I have small hands.
[159.00 → 163.00] So I would like to explain from an ergonomics perspective why they've done that.
[163.00 → 165.00] I can already barely reach...
[165.00 → 166.00] See, I'm going to show you guys this.
[166.00 → 168.00] I can barely reach to the edge of my iPhone screen.
[168.00 → 174.00] Had they made it a little bit wider, I wouldn't be able to reach at all, especially something in the top left corner.
[174.00 → 176.00] I can barely make it up there.
[176.00 → 180.00] So that's why I think they've gone ahead and done it that way.
[180.00 → 181.00] So yeah, okay guys.
[181.00 → 182.00] You guys are giving me a hard time.
[182.00 → 184.00] You're like, yeah, it has a better screen, it has a better camera.
[184.00 → 187.00] I understand all of that and that's all fine and good.
[187.00 → 191.00] But it's very small incremental changes.
[191.00 → 195.00] I mean, I've got a friend, one of my badminton buddies is just like...
[195.00 → 198.00] I asked him about this when the 4S was released.
[198.00 → 199.00] I was like, okay, you got iPhone 4.
[199.00 → 200.00] What do you think?
[200.00 → 202.00] Are you planning to upgrade to the 4S?
[202.00 → 204.00] He's like, yeah.
[204.00 → 207.00] I'm like, okay, why?
[207.00 → 209.00] And he's like, oh, because I just...
[209.00 → 213.00] I have the latest one and that's the kind of guy I am.
[213.00 → 215.00] And I'm like, oh, okay.
[215.00 → 223.00] So you're the kind of guy who just buys it because just whatever.
[223.00 → 229.00] And if you followed me on Twitter, Aussie832, you would already know that I play badminton.
[229.00 → 232.00] So you should be following me on Twitter at Linus Tech.
[232.00 → 233.00] So there you go.
[233.00 → 234.00] Bam.
[234.00 → 237.00] I'm going to try and read some of these comments here for a little bit, guys.
[237.00 → 244.00] Reliquifol, your important question about water cooling in a 3930K in a particular sort of configuration.
[244.00 → 257.00] I can't take any questions about exact configurations on these live streams because I have to focus on the things that everyone stands a chance of finding relevant.
[257.00 → 259.00] Alright, here we go.
[259.00 → 260.00] Two-year upgrade cycle is good.
[260.00 → 262.00] Yeah, two-year upgrade cycle is okay.
[262.00 → 264.00] But I don't really understand why.
[264.00 → 268.00] My iPhone 4 already does everything I could possibly want.
[268.00 → 272.00] Someone's asking me, when's the next NCI warehouse sale?
[272.00 → 273.00] Probably not coming for a little while.
[273.00 → 281.00] If you guys don't know, our warehouse sales at NCI are like crazy, crazy things that basically involve...
[281.00 → 284.00] Here, I'm going to switch over to my other view here.
[284.00 → 285.00] There we go.
[285.00 → 290.00] Crazy, crazy things that involve us selling stuff at like half of our original cost.
[290.00 → 292.00] I'm going to go ahead and change this to the Connect tab.
[292.00 → 294.00] I'm going to take some questions on Twitter as well.
[294.00 → 299.00] So I'm going to try and pay attention to Twitter as well as the Twitch TV chat.
[299.00 → 302.00] I'm just going to move myself a little bit to the side here.
[302.00 → 306.00] Yeah, let's do some questions.
[306.00 → 310.00] When are the 8000 series AMD GPUs going to be out?
[310.00 → 318.00] Guys, I hope you know that I cannot speculate on any kind of upcoming video cards or anything like that.
[318.00 → 320.00] This really doesn't work like that.
[320.00 → 322.00] What do I think of the PS Vita?
[322.00 → 327.00] If you've ever tried the Vita, you'll know that the screen is actually outstanding.
[327.00 → 332.00] It's got the usual sort of like PlayStation controls that you've come to expect.
[332.00 → 348.00] But from my perspective, I don't see the point because we can already use emulators on our Android phones, or we can use our phones, especially if you have like a Terra powered phone or anything like that to run pretty intensive games.
[348.00 → 355.00] And the whole point of a handheld console to me is really, really going away very, very quickly.
[355.00 → 358.00] Ryan wants me to turn down the contrast and white balance.
[358.00 → 361.00] You know what, dude? There's not a lot I can do about it. This webcam sucks.
[361.00 → 366.00] And I tried playing around with the colours and just, yeah, nothing good was happening there.
[366.00 → 373.00] So Wei Jun GU wants to know what happened to Slick. Slick has not gone anywhere.
[373.00 → 378.00] We have a new intern. His name is Diesel. Slick is 100% still with the show.
[378.00 → 381.00] In fact, Slick is actually spending his entire evening tonight.
[381.00 → 385.00] I dropped by his place. I had his check. I had a tablet for him to borrow for a little while.
[385.00 → 389.00] He can use it for his schoolwork. He can download textbooks or something like that.
[389.00 → 396.00] And I also dropped him off all the latest upcoming Trinity Apus.
[396.00 → 402.00] So he has three new processors from AMD that have a CPU and a GPU built into them.
[402.00 → 412.00] He also has the all new FX chip. So I dropped off five motherboards, some competing Intel CPUs,
[412.00 → 417.00] four new AMD CPUs, an 8150 and an 1100T just for giggles.
[417.00 → 423.00] So we are going to have a ton of content coming up about all of AMD's new video cards.
[423.00 → 429.00] And Slick is 100% on board. He's working on them. And we're very, very excited about that.
[429.00 → 435.00] I mean, personally, guys, I really do wish for a competitive AMD.
[435.00 → 441.00] I think it helps us have a healthier marketplace. I think it gives consumers more options.
[441.00 → 444.00] And I believe it's very, very important.
[444.00 → 447.00] Joseph wants to know what I thought about the MSI M-Power.
[447.00 → 450.00] I think I have three videos about it, Joseph.
[450.00 → 455.00] I think it's awesome. I think that manufacturers stepping up the way that they do quality control
[455.00 → 458.00] should be the way that they're differentiating from each other.
[458.00 → 461.00] Because it's one thing if, you know, a manufacturer says,
[461.00 → 467.00] Well, it has Japanese capacitors, but that doesn't mean anything unless they're backing it up with a longer warranty
[467.00 → 472.00] or they're really Acting it in a way that means that you will not receive a DOA.
[472.00 → 476.00] I mean, MSI won't come out and say you can't get a DOA M-Power motherboard,
[476.00 → 483.00] but I would come out and say you pretty much can't get an MSI M-Power motherboard that's dead on arrival.
[483.00 → 486.00] It should pretty much work right off the bat.
[486.00 → 489.00] MB wants to know if streams on Twitch will be recorded and put on YouTube.
[489.00 → 494.00] Absolutely they will. 100% it will be happening.
[494.00 → 497.00] RAMDAC is not impressed with the new iPhone.
[497.00 → 500.00] Make a lightning cable review on Linus Cat Tips.
[500.00 → 505.00] You know what, this is sort of an interesting suggestion for one reason here.
[505.00 → 507.00] So I'm going to share this with you guys.
[507.00 → 514.00] If you guys haven't already seen this, I forgot to set up my hotkeys for switching between these things.
[514.00 → 519.00] So let's go ahead and search for Thunderbolt cable.
[519.00 → 523.00] You know what, I wonder how many videos there are about Apple's Thunderbolt cable.
[523.00 → 525.00] There can't be that many.
[525.00 → 527.00] And apparently it won't be.
[527.00 → 529.00] Ah yes, the Thunderbolt cable unboxing.
[529.00 → 535.00] If you guys haven't already seen this, you know, I don't like to toot my own horn or anything.
[535.00 → 538.00] Oh, look at this. We're all going to watch the ad together.
[538.00 → 544.00] I'm showing you guys what not to do. Don't skip the ad. That's bad. You don't want to do that.
[544.00 → 546.00] So we're going to go to full screen here.
[546.00 → 551.00] And this is probably one of my favourite videos that Slick and I have ever worked on together.
[551.00 → 557.00] I don't know if... Can you guys hear? I don't know. Can you hear?
[557.00 → 558.00] I don't know if you can hear.
[558.00 → 568.00] But basically we were... We decided to find out what the effects of opening up a $50 cable could be.
[568.00 → 571.00] People are saying, no we can't hear. Can you hear now?
[571.00 → 575.00] No we cannot hear. Yes, no, no, yes, no.
[575.00 → 581.00] So you guys are making it impossible to tell. Okay, whatever. It doesn't matter. You don't really need the sound.
[581.00 → 593.00] So we basically... Yeah, we basically figured out that if you open up one of these $50 cables, it turns you into some kind of phenomenal superhero.
[593.00 → 599.00] Guys, there's no sound. There's really no sound. All you have to do is just kind of watch the video here.
[599.00 → 608.00] And you can experience. If you really want to watch it with sound, then all you have to do is go search for Thunderbolt cable on YouTube.
[608.00 → 617.00] And you will experience something that you will rarely experience outside this particular video.
[617.00 → 622.00] So I don't know if you guys saw that. We're going to go back. We're going to rewind to the part where I go flying through the fence.
[622.00 → 629.00] I was planning to fix my fence anyway. So you can see there's actually already holes in the fence right here.
[629.00 → 637.00] See this spot where there's a hole in the fence? So yeah, since I was planning on that anyway, I decided we might as well just try and break the fence.
[637.00 → 645.00] And see how that went for us. My wife was super impressed with this video. She definitely thought it was our finest work.
[645.00 → 650.00] And I'm sorry the video is lagging. We are going to get better equipment soon.
[650.00 → 658.00] I actually have a couple of... What are they called? Black Magic, Intensity, whatever, the Thunderbolt one, the external one.
[658.00 → 666.00] So I have a couple of those coming soon. And I'm definitely excited about being able to stream from an HDMI capture card,
[666.00 → 683.00] as opposed to relying on sort of fail stuff like what we're doing right now, which is like webcams and audio capture that's just terrible compared to what we really should be using.
[683.00 → 690.00] So let's go back to our Twitter feed here and see if we've got any other great questions on Twitter.
[690.00 → 699.00] Guys, if you're not already following me on Twitter, it's at Linus Tech. So make sure you're doing that because Twitter's going to be my primary way of communicating during these live streams.
[699.00 → 706.00] So if you... Yeah, if you're not on Twitter, then just get Twitter. It's really not that hard. You just sign up for it.
[706.00 → 714.00] People... Okay, people have sort of an interest... Everyone has a different philosophy about social media, social networks signing up for things.
[714.00 → 724.00] So number one, Twitter's big enough that they're not going to sell your information. They have a privacy policy and corporate whatever, Hoxha, that it's not going to be that much of a problem.
[724.00 → 746.00] And a social network is only as intrusive and annoying as you allow it to be. If you follow every retailer who throws a contest at you on Twitter, or if you follow every celebrity that has a staff of six people writing tweets for them and then posting it, then yes, you will have a really obnoxious Twitter feed, and it'll become ignoring-worthy.
[746.00 → 753.00] However, if you just follow people that you genuinely want to interact with, then I really don't think it's that bad.
[753.00 → 768.00] I think the lightning cable is quite awesome. I'm really interested to see why the lightning cable. Like, is this a Thunderbolt compatible thing? Is... I don't know. I'm just finding this whole thing very, very confusing.
[768.00 → 775.00] Although Tim Cook claims for the iPhone 5 that the lightning connector is staying for a long time. So... Yeah.
[775.00 → 788.00] As for Twitter sucking, I know. I know. But the reason Twitter sucks is because of all the spam, horrible, stupid content on it. Like, trending topics? This is the worst thing in the world and just plain shouldn't exist.
[788.00 → 799.00] Toast wants me to take my server off the floor. Okay, I'll tell you what, Toast. If you buy me a rack to install in my storage closet, then I will take my server off the floor. No big deal.
[799.00 → 806.00] Linus, do I know anything about the iPad Mini? No. No one really knows anything about it.
[806.00 → 814.00] Lachlan wants to know, what's the best Cherry MX Blue keyboard? You know what? Pretty much any MX Blue keyboard is pretty good.
[814.00 → 825.00] Although, out of the build quality of the keyboards that we've really spent time with, if I was picking something for doing lots of typing, or for gaming, or actually basically for anything, I would go with the Filch.
[825.00 → 835.00] Just find any Filch keyboard. You can get, like, the camo one, or the ones with, like, the writing on, like, the bottom or the side of the switches, or whatever. It doesn't matter.
[835.00 → 844.00] Filch keyboards are built like tanks. Like, they're not Model M's, but they're outstanding. So, yeah, that's probably what I would go with. Anything from Filch.
[844.00 → 855.00] Linus, do you have any info about a GeForce-based GK110 card by NVIDIA? I would love to explain to you guys what an NDA is. An NDA is a non-disclosure agreement.
[855.00 → 866.00] Basically, for anyone to tell me anything, whether they're NVIDIA or Intel, AMD, whoever else, they make me sign my name on a piece of paper that says I will not disclose any information about it.
[866.00 → 876.00] If I were to break an NDA, I would never get a sample of anything ever again. So, doesn't happen. I will not talk about things that aren't released unless I have prior approval,
[876.00 → 884.00] because I want to be able to keep bringing content to you guys, and I'm not going to be able to do that if I can't get any video cards or CPUs or motherboards.
[884.00 → 893.00] Then I'll just, I'll be like, I'll be an Apple channel. And I will talk about Apple.
[893.00 → 900.00] Savage Joe says, Linus, I don't use Twitter, so here's my question. Savage Joe, learn to use Twitter, and then I will answer your question.
[900.00 → 902.00] Actually, I'll answer your question anyway.
[902.00 → 906.00] Could an audio chip on a motherboard cause random freezing and sound looping? Absolutely.
[906.00 → 912.00] Onboard audio sucks balls. It sucks balls in every possible way. You don't use it.
[912.00 → 925.00] There are motherboards that do have decent onboard audio. Something like a Maximus 4, rather, Maximus 5 formula has truly well-designed onboard audio
[925.00 → 930.00] that has true PCB separation from the rest of the traces, the rest of the components on the board.
[930.00 → 937.00] However, 99.9% of boards do not have the kind of engineering that Asus put into that board and are terrible.
[937.00 → 941.00] So don't use them. You should always be using a real sound card.
[941.00 → 948.00] And those of you who don't believe me, actually, this is great because I did a video about the Asus Sonar DDX or DG or something like that.
[948.00 → 954.00] Low-end Asus sound card. And I had someone message me. Like they wrote out this long message.
[954.00 → 962.00] And they were like, Linus, thank you so much for enlightening me. I always thought onboard sound was fine.
[962.00 → 967.00] And, you know, I was on hard forum or whatever the forum. It was some forum where they think they know a lot, but they don't.
[967.00 → 974.00] I was on this forum and everyone said sound cards are for audio files or whatever else. They're not.
[974.00 → 979.00] And someone says they have a Maximus 5 formula. Okay. Something, something.
[979.00 → 986.00] Anyway, so he said, you know what, I always thought it was fine because people said that it's for audio files only, and you can never tell the difference. Blah, blah, blah.
[986.00 → 997.00] I installed a cheapo sound card and my eyes have been opened because a sound card makes a difference to everything you do, whether it's games, music, movies, windows, sounds.
[997.00 → 1001.00] It doesn't matter. You need to have a sound card. Everyone needs a sound card. It's not negotiable.
[1001.00 → 1008.00] Someone has a Maximus 5. Cool story, bro. Linus, do you love me from Justin? Absolutely.
[1008.00 → 1017.00] Everyone who's taking the time to be here with me at 10 o'clock, my time, to just listen to me ramble about random hardware, I love you all.
[1017.00 → 1022.00] Because Lime fire says, no, I don't love... No, yes, I do. I just said I do.
[1022.00 → 1028.00] Mind you, I think there's a bit of a delay on the stream, so we should give... Is John still here?
[1028.00 → 1035.00] We should give him a hard time about it. John, fix your leg. Or something. Bam.
[1035.00 → 1040.00] This is my first time using Twitch, and I'm already burning their service.
[1040.00 → 1047.00] However, it's 100 times better than Google Hangouts On-air, which I was super not impressed about.
[1047.00 → 1055.00] And super not happy about because it glitched out and was generally not very good in any way.
[1055.00 → 1060.00] So hold on, give me two seconds here, guys. I'm just going to try and figure out if I can transition,
[1060.00 → 1067.00] if I can find a way to bind my scenes to hotkeys. Because there's a way to do this, and I don't remember how to do it.
[1067.00 → 1070.00] Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'll just keep doing it with the mouse.
[1070.00 → 1077.00] Speaking of YouTube live streams, for those of you who don't know, I'm trying to communicate this as much as I can.
[1077.00 → 1084.00] And I will be uploading these Twitch live streams to YouTube when I'm done. So if you miss them, you can watch them on YouTube. No problem.
[1084.00 → 1094.00] And Black Pseudocode says he has to go. And I'm very sorry. In the future, I'm probably going to be moving these live streams back an hour.
[1094.00 → 1101.00] So it'll be 9pm my time, which will be midnight Eastern Standard Time, which is better for Canadians.
[1101.00 → 1110.00] And I mean, the rest of the world, I'm sorry, but I've had no matter what time I do it at, someone from Asia or someone from Europe is going to tell.
[1110.00 → 1115.00] Okay, remember, guys, there are 24 time zones in the world, not counting like the ones that don't count like Newfoundland,
[1115.00 → 1125.00] where they're like half an hour ahead. So there's 24 major time zones. And then everyone during that time probably is sleeping for eight hours and at work for eight hours.
[1125.00 → 1134.00] So there is a there is like a two in three chance that no matter what time I stream at, you won't be able to watch it because you're at work or because you're sleeping.
[1134.00 → 1141.00] So I can only do so much. And I really appreciate those of you who are tuning in no matter what time it is.
[1141.00 → 1150.00] Luca ZSWS2 something says it's 7am his time. Dude, I wouldn't be up if it was 7am. So I really appreciate that.
[1150.00 → 1159.00] You guys are awesome in every possible way. Salman Elite wants to know why there haven't been any Linus Cat Tips videos.
[1159.00 → 1166.00] Honestly, it's been a bit of a, well, here, I'm going to go get my, I'm going to go get my camera, and I'll explain why with a prop.
[1166.00 → 1184.00] So I'll be back in two seconds. Was that two seconds? I hope that was pretty good. Okay. So this camera, this is my high-end camera.
[1184.00 → 1194.00] This is my XA10. This camera I usually don't transport to and from home. So I, this is the only one that performs half decent in my house.
[1194.00 → 1201.00] Because my house doesn't have a great lighting and my regular blob, blob, blob camera, blob, blob, blob, blob, blob.
[1201.00 → 1206.00] My blog camera, the SX1IS cannot capture video in my house worth crap.
[1206.00 → 1209.00] So the only times I can really use it on weekends because I work during the day.
[1209.00 → 1214.00] And on weekends, I like to spend time with my family as much as I possibly can.
[1214.00 → 1223.00] When I'm not like benchmarking stuff and whatnot. So, and as for you guys complaining about the washed out colours, I will be dealing with it soon.
[1223.00 → 1225.00] Okay. Just relax.
[1225.00 → 1229.00] So anyway, right. So this camera, I don't usually bring it home. And so there's no time to film the cats.
[1229.00 → 1233.00] They're adorable still. I love them to death. And they're always up to their antics.
[1233.00 → 1240.00] But I will be looking at bringing the Linus Cat Tips channel back once we get ourselves a couple of new Panasonic cameras.
[1240.00 → 1245.00] And I can start transporting this one around with me as my general purpose blog camera.
[1245.00 → 1248.00] So, yes. Very exciting stuff.
[1248.00 → 1250.00] Linus, from the Brimstone.
[1250.00 → 1256.00] Is there any real difference between the GTX 670M and a desktop GTX 670? Yes.
[1256.00 → 1264.00] All the difference in the world, mobile graphics cards are very underpowered compared to their desktop equivalents.
[1264.00 → 1272.00] Basically, the naming schemes on notebook graphics cards seem to be designed to be as confusing as possible.
[1272.00 → 1275.00] So, just give up now.
[1275.00 → 1284.00] The only thing that you can do is you can find a review where someone has benchmarked a notebook with that graphics card.
[1284.00 → 1288.00] And that will give you some idea how it will perform. That's pretty much all you can do.
[1288.00 → 1292.00] Let's see if we can get to some more Twitter questions here, guys.
[1292.00 → 1297.00] John Norton wants to know, MSI or ASUS for an LGA 1155 socket?
[1297.00 → 1304.00] Well, first, if you buy a socket by itself, you're not going to get the functionality that you expect from that product.
[1304.00 → 1312.00] Because the socket is not actually what delivers the communication between the CPU and the rest of your system.
[1312.00 → 1315.00] You will need a full motherboard to go with that socket.
[1315.00 → 1320.00] And I would definitely suggest to you that actually either MSI or ASUS are great options.
[1320.00 → 1325.00] Right now, for gamers, I would particularly take a look at the M Power board from MSI.
[1325.00 → 1330.00] It actually has an incredibly full feature set for the price, plus it has that extra QC they're putting into it.
[1330.00 → 1334.00] Or the Sabertoothed from ASUS, which comes with a 5-year warranty.
[1334.00 → 1342.00] And their thermal armour, which is not really that important for cooling, but looks badass in your system,
[1342.00 → 1344.00] especially if you want to go for a nice, clean build.
[1344.00 → 1348.00] And those of you who are into games, Jason Cheng, yes, I play badminton.
[1348.00 → 1350.00] Calm down. Stop typing in all caps.
[1350.00 → 1355.00] Something. Now I've lost what I was talking about.
[1355.00 → 1358.00] Right. So the Sabertoothed looks badass.
[1358.00 → 1363.00] You want nice, clean cabling. You want like a sweet-looking gaming system, lighting effects and stuff.
[1363.00 → 1364.00] So yes, it's a very good choice.
[1364.00 → 1365.00] Either of them are good.
[1365.00 → 1367.00] Anything from the big three.
[1367.00 → 1370.00] ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte. Those are your big three.
[1370.00 → 1374.00] A lot of people are starting to count AS Rock. I don't yet.
[1374.00 → 1376.00] I need to see it proven to me first.
[1376.00 → 1380.00] And I just really haven't had much experience with their board,
[1380.00 → 1383.00] so I don't feel that confident recommending them.
[1383.00 → 1385.00] Alright. Daniel says,
[1385.00 → 1390.00] At what point in your life did you decide to make a living off unboxing, benchmarking, etc. electronic products?
[1390.00 → 1394.00] I do not make a living off of what I do here on the internet.
[1394.00 → 1398.00] At least not yet. I make a living as a product manager at NCI.
[1398.00 → 1402.00] In fact, I'd love to share with you guys another YouTube video here.
[1402.00 → 1407.00] So I'm just going to...this is a series that I've started doing,
[1407.00 → 1411.00] and I'd love to change this into a live show at some point.
[1411.00 → 1415.00] But this is Net linked Weekly. You can watch all the episodes on the Tube.
[1415.00 → 1422.00] And in episode... I believe it's Net linked Weekly, episode 8,
[1422.00 → 1426.00] I actually interview myself about my job.
[1426.00 → 1429.00] So I pose a...okay.
[1429.00 → 1433.00] You know, it's funny because...here, this is hilarious, okay?
[1433.00 → 1434.00] So this is an aside.
[1434.00 → 1442.00] Google's terms of service dictate to me that I cannot intentionally use my own ads to drive revenue to myself.
[1442.00 → 1446.00] So why does it serve me ads when I'm watching my videos?
[1446.00 → 1448.00] Some of which are unskippable.
[1448.00 → 1453.00] This is like paradox mind brewery that's going on here because...
[1453.00 → 1457.00] I can't skip the ad. I want to watch my own video.
[1457.00 → 1462.00] But if I watch the ad, then I will be violating YouTube's terms of service.
[1462.00 → 1468.00] I mean, can they ban me from YouTube for watching my own ad?
[1468.00 → 1470.00] It's like unbelievable.
[1470.00 → 1472.00] Anyway, sorry, let's switch back.
[1472.00 → 1477.00] So in this episode of Net linked Weekly, I interview me...let's just make the player a little bigger here
[1477.00 → 1479.00] so you guys can actually see what's going on.
[1479.00 → 1482.00] At least I think I do in this episode. If it's the wrong one...ah, yes, here we go.
[1482.00 → 1490.00] So I ask myself like a question, and then I magically appear in the shot to answer the question.
[1490.00 → 1495.00] And I actually changed my shirt in between every shot.
[1495.00 → 1499.00] And see, I answered my own question. I actually put sunglasses on.
[1499.00 → 1502.00] So if you guys...yes, I know there's no sound. Calm down.
[1502.00 → 1504.00] I haven't figured out how to do it.
[1504.00 → 1510.00] So anyway, this was fun.
[1510.00 → 1515.00] And you guys should definitely subscribe to the SITCOM channel
[1515.00 → 1522.00] so that you can definitely check out this weekly content as well as all the other videos I do over there.
[1522.00 → 1532.00] In fact, originally, Linus Tech Tips existed for the sole purpose of unboxing the products,
[1532.00 → 1538.00] just doing like quick showcases of the product to improve our time to market with the videos for NCI Tech Tips videos.
[1538.00 → 1546.00] So if you go back at some of the older NCI Tech Tips videos... I'm just going to bring up the NCI channel here,
[1546.00 → 1554.00] and I'll flip over to that on scene 3 because I'm like totally managing the scenes.
[1554.00 → 1559.00] I'm using XSplit like a boss. Actually, I'm not using XSplit like a boss.
[1559.00 → 1564.00] I'm using XSplit like some noob that's horrible and doesn't know how to use it.
[1564.00 → 1571.00] So let's go back to some of the older episodes. Like when did we start doing unboxing?
[1571.00 → 1578.00] I think we started doing unboxing around the time...yeah, no, it was definitely after this.
[1578.00 → 1583.00] Okay, now I've gotten confused, and I've lost track of what's going on.
[1583.00 → 1588.00] Hmm, it was around the launch of Socket 1156. Ah, yes!
[1588.00 → 1592.00] So like around the time we started doing...oh, maybe it wasn't.
[1592.00 → 1595.00] Okay, you know what? I give up on this. I'm just going to switch back to the other scene.
[1595.00 → 1599.00] And let's just forget about that whole thing and that that ever happened
[1599.00 → 1602.00] because I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about.
[1602.00 → 1605.00] So Daniel, in short, I didn't.
[1605.00 → 1611.00] Mark, I live in Korea where people are glued to their phones and tablets to the point where it scares me.
[1611.00 → 1613.00] Will the same happen elsewhere? I believe so.
[1613.00 → 1617.00] In fact, I was having an argument with one of my coworkers not that long ago
[1617.00 → 1624.00] where I suggested to him that what will happen and that it's happening today
[1624.00 → 1628.00] that no one will actually know how to drive their car anywhere
[1628.00 → 1634.00] because for me, when I first started driving, and you couldn't...you didn't know where you were going,
[1634.00 → 1638.00] you had someone like draw on a piece of paper and like label it, and it was usually inaccurate
[1638.00 → 1644.00] or you actually kept a physical map in your car, and then you would pull over and read it
[1644.00 → 1646.00] and like try to figure out where you were going.
[1646.00 → 1651.00] Whereas now, this is the funniest thing, and I'm gonna... I'm totally going to burn slick here
[1651.00 → 1654.00] because he's such a like kids today in this way.
[1654.00 → 1657.00] He doesn't know how to get from his house to our studio.
[1657.00 → 1660.00] He follows Google Maps every time.
[1660.00 → 1662.00] He cannot do it by memory.
[1662.00 → 1667.00] And this backed up my argument with my coworker which was last summer when I said
[1667.00 → 1671.00] kids are not going to know how to navigate the road
[1671.00 → 1674.00] and they're not going to know how to use maps because they don't have to.
[1674.00 → 1679.00] They are going to grow up with turn by turn available to them at all times
[1679.00 → 1686.00] and the world is changing to the point where you're not gonna actually have to remember anything.
[1686.00 → 1687.00] Like when I...again, same thing.
[1687.00 → 1691.00] When I was growing up you had to remember a phone number to call someone.
[1691.00 → 1694.00] If you couldn't remember a girl's phone number, you didn't write it down somewhere,
[1694.00 → 1696.00] like that was it.
[1696.00 → 1703.00] Whereas now, with the convenience of contact lists and address books,
[1703.00 → 1705.00] I don't know anybody's number.
[1705.00 → 1706.00] I know my own number.
[1706.00 → 1707.00] I know my wife's number.
[1707.00 → 1710.00] And I know my work number.
[1710.00 → 1712.00] I know my parents number.
[1712.00 → 1714.00] But guys, feel free.
[1714.00 → 1715.00] Post in the chat.
[1715.00 → 1716.00] Post in the chat on the Twitch TV.
[1716.00 → 1719.00] How many phone numbers do you actually know?
[1719.00 → 1722.00] Whereas when I was in elementary school, I knew all my friends' phone numbers.
[1722.00 → 1726.00] I knew all my relatives' phone numbers.
[1726.00 → 1728.00] There you go.
[1728.00 → 1730.00] I think things are changing.
[1730.00 → 1732.00] People asking how old I am.
[1732.00 → 1733.00] I am 26.
[1733.00 → 1734.00] So there you go.
[1734.00 → 1738.00] So I've been doing YouTube videos since I was about 21, 22.
[1738.00 → 1739.00] And see?
[1739.00 → 1740.00] See?
[1740.00 → 1741.00] People are replying.
[1741.00 → 1742.00] I know 911.
[1742.00 → 1743.00] Yeah, see exactly.
[1743.00 → 1745.00] 5, 5, 4, 6, 11, 30.
[1745.00 → 1747.00] People don't remember phone numbers anymore.
[1747.00 → 1751.00] And that's why, that's what made me think of this whole map thing,
[1751.00 → 1752.00] this navigation thing.
[1752.00 → 1755.00] If you have a phone that's just going to tell you what to do,
[1755.00 → 1757.00] and will even do it smarter than you can,
[1757.00 → 1759.00] because it'll tell you when there's traffic,
[1759.00 → 1760.00] it'll tell you if there's a roadblock,
[1760.00 → 1762.00] it'll tell you if there's a cop,
[1762.00 → 1765.00] why would you ever memorize it anymore?
[1765.00 → 1767.00] Very, very interesting stuff.
[1767.00 → 1768.00] Okay.
[1768.00 → 1772.00] Matt wants to know if you have a 2600K already,
[1772.00 → 1775.00] wait for Haswell or not worth upgrading?
[1775.00 → 1778.00] Probably not worth upgrading to Ivy Bridge,
[1778.00 → 1781.00] especially if you're an overclocked.
[1781.00 → 1784.00] The performance, I mean, it's either a tick or a toque.
[1784.00 → 1786.00] It's whichever one is the process shrink
[1786.00 → 1788.00] without that many architectural improvements.
[1788.00 → 1792.00] So wait for the big architectural improvements.
[1792.00 → 1795.00] Thorh13 wants to be a mod.
[1795.00 → 1796.00] Okay, done.
[1796.00 → 1798.00] If you want to block the porn links,
[1798.00 → 1800.00] then feel free my friend.
[1800.00 → 1802.00] Make it happen, sir.
[1802.00 → 1803.00] Alright.
[1803.00 → 1805.00] Moving on right along.
[1805.00 → 1808.00] Something, the best Linus video ever.
[1808.00 → 1809.00] Sweet.
[1809.00 → 1811.00] Have I heard about the...
[1811.00 → 1812.00] Okay, I think we're back to where...
[1812.00 → 1813.00] Oh my goodness.
[1813.00 → 1815.00] 200...214 new interactions.
[1815.00 → 1816.00] What am I going to do with you guys?
[1816.00 → 1819.00] I should show you some high school pictures.
[1819.00 → 1820.00] You know what?
[1820.00 → 1821.00] If you're subscribed on Twitter,
[1821.00 → 1823.00] or following on Twitter,
[1823.00 → 1825.00] I guess would be the correct terminology.
[1825.00 → 1826.00] It wasn't a high school picture,
[1826.00 → 1828.00] but this is one of my elementary school pictures.
[1828.00 → 1830.00] This is just fantastic.
[1830.00 → 1832.00] You guys are going to love this.
[1832.00 → 1835.00] I had the most outstanding mullet
[1835.00 → 1839.00] and bucktooth overbite that you ever did see.
[1839.00 → 1840.00] Check this out.
[1840.00 → 1842.00] I'm just going to hold this up to the camera.
[1842.00 → 1843.00] I hope this kind of works.
[1843.00 → 1847.00] That is me when I was in elementary school.
[1849.00 → 1852.00] Is that not like legendary hair?
[1852.00 → 1853.00] Right there.
[1853.00 → 1854.00] Oh, there we go.
[1854.00 → 1855.00] It's finally popped into focus.
[1855.00 → 1859.00] So, why would I not post old pictures of myself?
[1859.00 → 1863.00] I think that that should be evident
[1863.00 → 1866.00] based on that picture that I just shared with you all.
[1866.00 → 1867.00] See?
[1867.00 → 1868.00] For my American viewers.
[1868.00 → 1869.00] You all.
[1869.00 → 1871.00] I'm going to say you all and a.
[1871.00 → 1872.00] And I got...
[1872.00 → 1874.00] Someone burned me today at work for calling it OCT
[1874.00 → 1876.00] because apparently Z is...
[1876.00 → 1877.00] See, I can never remember.
[1877.00 → 1879.00] I use Z and Z interchangeably.
[1879.00 → 1881.00] I think these are very minor details in life.
[1881.00 → 1886.00] Steven wants to know,
[1886.00 → 1889.00] How do I think my son will think of me when he grows up?
[1889.00 → 1893.00] I have no idea because there will be so much video...
[1893.00 → 1895.00] I mean, I've thought about this because
[1895.00 → 1898.00] so much of what I've done over the last four years
[1898.00 → 1901.00] is documented on the internet.
[1901.00 → 1907.00] And try as I might to erase any of it,
[1907.00 → 1909.00] it's just there forever.
[1909.00 → 1911.00] That's what you realize at a certain point.
[1911.00 → 1912.00] So check this out.
[1912.00 → 1916.00] Linus, top, moments or something like that.
[1916.00 → 1917.00] Like some guy...
[1917.00 → 1919.00] Linus, moments...
[1919.00 → 1922.00] I don't remember where it is, but moments...
[1922.00 → 1923.00] There, there.
[1923.00 → 1924.00] I think this is the one.
[1924.00 → 1925.00] It might be him.
[1925.00 → 1926.00] It might be someone else.
[1926.00 → 1931.00] Like people do compilations of like me on the internet.
[1931.00 → 1935.00] That is, to me, like the strangest thing ever.
[1935.00 → 1937.00] But like, I mean, look at this.
[1937.00 → 1947.00] I think there's another one.
[1947.00 → 1950.00] And no, I'm not planning any Linux builds.
[1950.00 → 1952.00] Uh...
[1952.00 → 1955.00] Linus, tech...
[1955.00 → 1958.00] I don't know.
[1958.00 → 1961.00] I don't remember what it's called, but it's somewhere.
[1961.00 → 1964.00] I encountered it a little while ago.
[1964.00 → 1968.00] Someone like made this video that was just a bunch of random,
[1968.00 → 1970.00] random Linus tech tips, uh...
[1970.00 → 1971.00] Linus tech tips moments.
[1971.00 → 1974.00] But it really made me realize that, um...
[1974.00 → 1977.00] No matter what I do, I will always be sort of there on the internet.
[1977.00 → 1978.00] Um...
[1978.00 → 1982.00] One of the other moments I had about this was to do with not only my,
[1982.00 → 1985.00] my own persistence on the internet, but also cloud computing.
[1985.00 → 1987.00] So if you guys haven't seen the...
[1987.00 → 1989.00] Sorry, I'm going to switch back to that, uh...
[1989.00 → 1990.00] to that other window.
[1990.00 → 1991.00] Uh...
[1991.00 → 1992.00] NCI cloud.
[1992.00 → 1996.00] Watch this episode, because it didn't get a lot of views.
[1996.00 → 2000.00] But I think what you guys can see here is from the like to dislike ratio,
[2000.00 → 2002.00] which is 2000 to 14.
[2002.00 → 2005.00] It was actually an outstanding video that we did, uh...
[2005.00 → 2008.00] where I talked a lot about the...
[2008.00 → 2011.00] the level of discomfort I have over, um...
[2011.00 → 2013.00] what happened when my accounts got hijacked.
[2013.00 → 2016.00] So if you guys haven't been subscribed for a long time, about a year ago,
[2016.00 → 2017.00] both of my accounts got hijacked.
[2017.00 → 2022.00] Someone got a keylogger on my machine, took them over, wiped out all my videos,
[2022.00 → 2024.00] uh... posted a bunch of spam videos.
[2024.00 → 2027.00] It took me about a month to get them back, dealing with, uh...
[2027.00 → 2030.00] dealing with partner support, dealing with Google's support team,
[2030.00 → 2034.00] which was non-existent at the time, but they've been quite a bit better since then.
[2034.00 → 2036.00] And, um...
[2036.00 → 2039.00] what happened when I got in touch with Google's support was they not only restored my channel,
[2039.00 → 2044.00] which is great, but they restored every video I had ever deleted as well.
[2044.00 → 2047.00] So things like test footage that we...
[2047.00 → 2049.00] that we, uh... that we uploaded a long time ago,
[2049.00 → 2053.00] um... things like... like videos that we never intended to release,
[2053.00 → 2054.00] all just got released.
[2054.00 → 2060.00] And what I realized is you never delete anything from the cloud at all.
[2060.00 → 2062.00] And, uh... how terrifying is that?
[2062.00 → 2065.00] Because it means that your data will always be there.
[2065.00 → 2068.00] So that's, uh... that's why I created my own off-site backup server,
[2068.00 → 2070.00] and I do try to turn all of my...
[2070.00 → 2073.00] um... I do try to turn all of my...
[2073.00 → 2075.00] what are I...
[2075.00 → 2076.00] uh...
[2076.00 → 2079.00] Right, I do try to store all of my data on my own servers
[2079.00 → 2082.00] as opposed to using services like Dropbox or whatever else.
[2082.00 → 2084.00] Linus, I have wanted to ask this for ages.
[2084.00 → 2085.00] Are you streaming from a kitchen?
[2085.00 → 2087.00] I am absolutely streaming from a kitchen.
[2087.00 → 2090.00] I would love to share with you guys my kitchen.
[2090.00 → 2092.00] This is my kitchen.
[2092.00 → 2094.00] So, this is my rice cooker.
[2094.00 → 2097.00] This is my juice jug.
[2097.00 → 2100.00] Uh... this is my Saran Wrap.
[2100.00 → 2103.00] This is my Power line adapter box.
[2103.00 → 2105.00] So, I'm using Power line now, guys.
[2105.00 → 2108.00] I am not using wireless for my stream this week.
[2108.00 → 2109.00] Okay?
[2109.00 → 2111.00] Power line is... is beastly.
[2111.00 → 2114.00] That is my Tropical, which I should have some of.
[2114.00 → 2117.00] That is my Shepherd's Pie, which was freaking delicious.
[2117.00 → 2118.00] My wife made it.
[2118.00 → 2121.00] And that is the tin foil that was covering the Shepherd's Pie.
[2121.00 → 2122.00] That is an oven mitt.
[2122.00 → 2123.00] That is my bread box.
[2123.00 → 2124.00] That's my butter dish.
[2124.00 → 2125.00] That's my microwave.
[2125.00 → 2127.00] These are my cabinets.
[2127.00 → 2128.00] Okay?
[2128.00 → 2131.00] Uh... I don't have a degree, for those of you asking.
[2131.00 → 2132.00] That is my fridge.
[2132.00 → 2133.00] That is my fridge.
[2133.00 → 2136.00] That is my backpack that I carry my things in.
[2136.00 → 2139.00] This is my baby's swinging seat.
[2139.00 → 2144.00] That is a laundry hamper, which is in the kitchen for, you know, probably a good reason.
[2144.00 → 2145.00] This is my cereal.
[2145.00 → 2146.00] See?
[2146.00 → 2147.00] Delicious, right?
[2147.00 → 2148.00] Mini Wheats.
[2148.00 → 2150.00] And behind it is Honey Nut Cheerios.
[2150.00 → 2152.00] And that is Cream of Wheat.
[2152.00 → 2154.00] This is my dish rack.
[2154.00 → 2156.00] This is my paper towels.
[2156.00 → 2160.00] This is my recycling pile that I take out once in a while.
[2160.00 → 2162.00] Uh... my cabinets are here.
[2162.00 → 2166.00] And... there are more cabinets behind there, but you can't see them.
[2166.00 → 2168.00] That is my water cooler.
[2168.00 → 2173.00] That is a bunch of baby crap that you can see, because I have a baby.
[2173.00 → 2176.00] Uh... that is his bouncy seat, right there.
[2176.00 → 2177.00] With his...
[2177.00 → 2180.00] Foam... sorry... with his stuffed animal sock... and his soccer ball.
[2180.00 → 2181.00] That I throw.
[2181.00 → 2182.00] And he likes.
[2182.00 → 2183.00] Oh, that's my dinner.
[2183.00 → 2184.00] Okay?
[2184.00 → 2186.00] Gotten... things... things got too real there.
[2186.00 → 2187.00] My dinner.
[2187.00 → 2188.00] Uh... AJR.
[2188.00 → 2190.00] I'm sorry it's so late.
[2190.00 → 2194.00] Uh... we can potentially look at changing the time of the stream at some point.
[2194.00 → 2196.00] But, uh...
[2196.00 → 2201.00] Yeah, nothing we can do for this week, because it's already started.
[2201.00 → 2209.00] Let's go ahead and go back to our... go back to our... go back to our Twitter, and see if we can find anything that anyone wants to... wants to hear about.
[2209.00 → 2211.00] Uh... Linus, it's flip.
[2211.00 → 2214.00] Do I stay with LGA 1155 or LGA 2011?
[2214.00 → 2216.00] Because I just built a new PC with LGA 1155.
[2216.00 → 2218.00] Stick with LGA 1155 for now.
[2218.00 → 2221.00] Uh... in fact, the highest end chips...
[2221.00 → 2223.00] Um...
[2223.00 → 2227.00] Uh... are... are on LGA 1155 right now, in terms of quad-course.
[2227.00 → 2230.00] Matt says, where does Linus live?
[2230.00 → 2232.00] This live show is crap.
[2232.00 → 2235.00] I would like to know how those two things are related.
[2235.00 → 2245.00] Matt, I am definitely waiting for you to post a follow-up to that, because I want to know why where I live is related to my live show not being very good.
[2245.00 → 2248.00] And I'm very sorry my live show is not very good.
[2248.00 → 2250.00] What is... oh, that's a good question.
[2250.00 → 2256.00] Justin45654 wants to know, what is your favourite looking GPU of all time?
[2256.00 → 2260.00] The GTX 480 is my favourite looking GPU.
[2260.00 → 2265.00] Not my favourite GPU in general, but definitely my favourite looking GPU.
[2265.00 → 2271.00] Those heat pipes that came out of the top of it are just... like... ugh! They're just so amazing.
[2271.00 → 2277.00] I mean, for those of you who don't know what a GTX 480 looks like, it is just a thing of beauty.
[2277.00 → 2279.00] And it's a thing of beauty out of necessity.
[2279.00 → 2284.00] I mean, I don't think NVIDIA wanted to spend this much on that cooler.
[2284.00 → 2287.00] Wow! Look at that! My favourite review site, Hardware Canucks.
[2287.00 → 2290.00] There you go. That is what a GTX 480 looks like.
[2290.00 → 2294.00] This... this was all metal. So... whoops, pointing the wrong way.
[2294.00 → 2296.00] That was all metal on the top.
[2296.00 → 2302.00] I have never seen that since, except for the GTX 690, which does use a metal shroud.
[2302.00 → 2306.00] But this metal was involved in the cooling because this GPU ran so friggin' hot.
[2306.00 → 2311.00] And those heat pipes that came out of the top made it incompatible with a number of cases.
[2311.00 → 2314.00] But like, oh, they looked so good.
[2314.00 → 2319.00] Slick's actually running my review sample of GTX 480.
[2319.00 → 2328.00] And Matt Mace says, you read. I was just saying the live show is crap. It was lagging for me.
[2328.00 → 2333.00] Oh! You mean it's crap. It's lagging, not it's crap. I suck at doing live streams.
[2333.00 → 2335.00] Although... hey, focus.
[2335.00 → 2338.00] Although it's possible that I suck at doing live streams.
[2338.00 → 2342.00] But this is still practiced for me. This is only my third live stream so far.
[2342.00 → 2344.00] So I'm still trying to get the hang of it.
[2344.00 → 2348.00] Anyway, GTX 480 is by far my favourite looking GPU.
[2348.00 → 2356.00] Right, Slick's still using it, and he doesn't even want to change it just because it looks so sexy and good and awesome.
[2356.00 → 2357.00] So back to Twitter.
[2357.00 → 2358.00] Alright, what do we get?
[2358.00 → 2360.00] Moving right along.
[2360.00 → 2363.00] Will you be doing reviews for the new Ivory Bridge i's?
[2363.00 → 2365.00] Not really. I mean, why?
[2365.00 → 2367.00] I'm really interested in getting one for gaming. I need an expert opinion.
[2367.00 → 2379.00] Adam West. Do not get it for gaming. Even AMD's last generation Apus are dramatically better for gaming than an Intel Ivory Bridge chip.
[2379.00 → 2391.00] If you do a search for APU NCI, you guys will find... not this one. Ah, yes. This guy right here. The Integrated Graphics IGP Showdown.
[2391.00 → 2399.00] Intel Ivy Bridge versus AMD Land. And more ads. I'm sorry for ads guys.
[2399.00 → 2407.00] But ads really do keep the NCI Tech Tips project going in a big way. And wow, my hair was outstanding in this video.
[2407.00 → 2419.00] So by the end of this video, I believe we put up some graphs that show the APU just absolutely demolishing even the higher end Ivory Bridge chips.
[2419.00 → 2425.00] Remember, these were i's. And... oh, oh, hold on, hold on. Wait for it. Yes.
[2425.00 → 2432.00] i's and i's, not i's, just getting destroyed. And yes, if this is the real Adam West, then I'm a huge fan.
[2432.00 → 2442.00] And if it's not the Adam West, then you imposter. How dare you defile his good name asking questions about i's on the internet.
[2442.00 → 2447.00] Have I ever heard of or used an Astro Gaming headset? Sorry, no dice.
[2447.00 → 2455.00] Although if everyone who recommends... everyone who asks me for a headset recommendation gets pretty much the same one.
[2455.00 → 2462.00] I'm a huge fan of the Steel Series 7H. Best audio quality for a gaming headset by far.
[2462.00 → 2468.00] The Asus Vulcan ANC is actually... okay, I shouldn't say by far because the Vulcan ANC is close and has active noise-cancelling.
[2468.00 → 2474.00] And then after that, it's just... it's a mix because... I mean, people are like, oh, I heard the Siberia V2 is perfect.
[2474.00 → 2479.00] Where did you hear the... Siberia V2 is perfect. Like, who told you this? Where are you guys getting information from?
[2479.00 → 2489.00] You should be watching my channel if you want information because... yeah, Siberia V2 is like... yeah, it's not good. It's comfortable.
[2489.00 → 2494.00] So it's kind of like the... it's like the Corsair Vengeance 1300 or 1500. It's like, it's comfortable.
[2494.00 → 2499.00] But this is not groundbreaking audio quality by any stretch of the imagination, guys. Don't kid yourself.
[2499.00 → 2506.00] You want a good headset, you buy a good headset. Not like a $40, $50, $60 headset. It's not going to be good.
[2506.00 → 2510.00] This is a terrible headset. It's already uncomfortable. I've only been wearing it for a little while.
[2510.00 → 2515.00] Kyle Harris wants to know if my wife gets along with Esther. I would think so. They're sisters.
[2515.00 → 2522.00] Moving right along. Isabella. Hi, hello, Linus. Showed this tweet on your live cam. P.S. My boyfriend loves your videos.
[2522.00 → 2531.00] There you go, Isabella. You are live. Or if you're watching this on YouTube after the live stream, then you're not live.
[2531.00 → 2536.00] Okay, moving right along. Hi, I love your show. What's your opinion of the Steel Series 7G?
[2536.00 → 2543.00] Is there a similar keyboard you suggest? I actually did a huge episode, a huge mechanical keyboard roundup.
[2543.00 → 2548.00] I know this is just turning into Linus schooling you guys on how if you actually watched my videos...
[2548.00 → 2555.00] Here, I bet it's the first hit if I search for mechanical keyboard. Bam! Other than the ad, first hit.
[2555.00 → 2561.00] Mechanical keyboard overview and showcase featuring pretty much every brand that matters.
[2561.00 → 2566.00] Look at all those keyboards. We have, what is it, 12 keyboards here.
[2566.00 → 2577.00] So if you guys paid attention, you would already know the answer to that question, which is that the 7G is a great keyboard, but...
[2577.00 → 2585.00] Back to Twitter. But, the keycaps sometimes fall off. The wrist rest on it is outstanding.
[2585.00 → 2589.00] My wife refuses to use anything but a 7G due to the awesome wrist rest.
[2589.00 → 2596.00] It looks ridiculous, but it is so comfortable to type on. So I would definitely recommend the 7G if you want the best wrist rest ever.
[2596.00 → 2602.00] Personally, I'm using a Me onyx Xyble60 right now, which is my favourite.
[2602.00 → 2614.00] Will I put my videos on DVD? You want a collection? Why don't you just get a Pivot Amos media set-top box and then use YouTube to watch them?
[2614.00 → 2618.00] Because I'm never taking them off YouTube. That won't happen.
[2618.00 → 2624.00] Arrow wants to say to me, use Chrome with AdBlock for skipping YouTube ads.
[2624.00 → 2627.00] I don't believe in skipping YouTube ads. I actually make a...
[2627.00 → 2633.00] Well, I don't make a living off of it, but I supplement my income with YouTube ads.
[2633.00 → 2646.00] So, it's kind of like asking software developers to pirate. They usually have some qualms about that because their entire livelihood relies on people not pirating software.
[2646.00 → 2655.00] So, yeah. Just so you know, your kitchen looks awesome. Thank you. I think my kitchen is awesome too. It's outstanding.
[2655.00 → 2661.00] Ah, great question from John Goldberg. And if you're the real John Goldberg, big fan.
[2661.00 → 2665.00] Coloured tubes or coloured water for a custom water loop?
[2665.00 → 2672.00] Coloured tubes for sure. Custom water causes so many problems because it just always gunks up.
[2672.00 → 2681.00] Like, everybody claims that their solution to the coloured water problem is going to cause it to not gunk up, but it always does.
[2681.00 → 2690.00] So, yeah. Coloured tubes. In fact, there is no reason for any tubing to exist other than Primo Flex by Primo Chill.
[2690.00 → 2697.00] They have outstanding coloured tubes that also are antimicrobial, so you don't have to put any other additives in your water.
[2697.00 → 2704.00] And they look outstanding. Truly says, read my Twitter. I will try, but I can only get through so many of them.
[2704.00 → 2716.00] Okay. Difference between the 660 and the 660 Ti? Well, performance. The actual GPU that they're using. The clock speed. The functional units. The price.
[2716.00 → 2719.00] What do you want me to tell you, man?
[2719.00 → 2728.00] Uh, DA-da-da-da-da. Simran Gill says, how do I read tweets like you do? I have no idea. I think you can search for, like, at Linus Tech.
[2728.00 → 2735.00] And that might help, but I'm not 100% sure. Josh wants to know what about VGA? And I suspect this is in the context of what I said earlier about the big three,
[2735.00 → 2746.00] ASUS Gigabyte MSI. If you're talking about motherboards, I personally don't really believe in using any motherboard that is not a volume component.
[2746.00 → 2753.00] So, the ones where they sell, like, hundreds of thousands of them, those are the ones that tend to get the after-sales support.
[2753.00 → 2759.00] Because if they didn't do it, then there'd be lots of customers who would be vocal about not supporting it.
[2759.00 → 2768.00] So, anything that's not a volume part, I generally avoid. And that includes every VGA motherboard ever, except their 680 board.
[2768.00 → 2782.00] So, I mean, I like their boards. And, I mean, but I just... yeah. For video cards, though, fine.
[2782.00 → 2792.00] Yes, VGA is a big three for video cards. In fact, the rumour has it that they sell, like, more high-end video cards in North America than everyone else combined.
[2792.00 → 2797.00] They're enormous.
[2797.00 → 2802.00] Let's move on down. Would I say the ASUS Cents is still my favourite sound card? No, there's a better one.
[2802.00 → 2805.00] I forget if it's the ST or the STX, but there's one that's actually better.
[2805.00 → 2811.00] I just use the Cents because it has that sexy chrome cover on it that I really like.
[2811.00 → 2819.00] Alright, so we've gotten down to where we had left off on tweets. So, oh, 188 new interactions. Wow. You guys are crazy.
[2819.00 → 2823.00] And, like, yeah, crazy stuff.
[2823.00 → 2827.00] Daniel says, Linus, this liquid works perfect. Daniel, you're wrong.
[2827.00 → 2833.00] Whether you think you're right or you think you're wrong, you're wrong. Because it doesn't work, and at some point it will bunk.
[2833.00 → 2842.00] They all do. I just don't care anymore. Use... yeah, use, uh, something. The other thing. Use coloured tubes.
[2842.00 → 2852.00] Someone wants me to answer the Peter Douglas... Peter Dresses tweet. I don't... I don't see it yet. At least, not yet.
[2852.00 → 2858.00] Shout out to fans in South Africa. Hail South Africa. I really don't think there are that many of you.
[2858.00 → 2865.00] But, um, if there are any, then fantastic. Thank you for viewing my livestream.
[2865.00 → 2874.00] I'm actually curious to know. If you guys can just sort of post in the chat or post on Twitter, I'd love to hear how you found the livestream tonight.
[2874.00 → 2881.00] Because I had people request that I post a video on YouTube about it. So are most of you following me here from the YouTube posting?
[2881.00 → 2891.00] Or, or what, or what's the deal? YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, YouTube. Okay. Okay. So that's... I'm probably going to keep doing that then.
[2891.00 → 2899.00] I'll just post a video that the livestream's coming and you guys can tune in. And, uh, and yeah, that, that'll... that looks like it's going to be the...
[2899.00 → 2905.00] Okay, alright. Calm down. That's enough. Okay. I got the point. YouTube. You guys. Just killing me here.
[2905.00 → 2912.00] Uh, Julian wants to know if I will ever dye my hair again. Um, you know what? Not unless there's some kind of particular...
[2912.00 → 2915.00] And yes, shout out to Prince Rupert. I've been there once before.
[2915.00 → 2920.00] My family had a devastating car accident. A car accident near Prince Rupert once.
[2920.00 → 2928.00] My mom broke her back. Um, my sister broke her arm. Um, yeah. Yeah. My mom suffered a head injury.
[2928.00 → 2933.00] Suffered a head injury that actually caused her to lose her ability to read.
[2933.00 → 2939.00] Um, however, I would like you guys to know that she made a full recovery, and she is, uh, she's a teacher now.
[2939.00 → 2946.00] And she finished her degree and, uh, she, she, uh, is an outstanding lady. Outstanding lady.
[2946.00 → 2952.00] Because she was in a coma and was, had a head injury to the point where she basically couldn't remember who any of her family were.
[2952.00 → 2955.00] And, uh, made, made one heck of a comeback.
[2955.00 → 2960.00] Okay. Last shout out to Victoria. No more shout-outs. Because shout-outs are basically a waste of time.
[2960.00 → 2963.00] Because no one but you care. You and Victoria.
[2963.00 → 2970.00] Day wants to know if I met Esther first or my wife. I met my wife first. Esther is my wife's sister.
[2970.00 → 2977.00] Ash wants to know, uh, do, do, do, do, do. Nah, his question is boring.
[2977.00 → 2980.00] Ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch.
[2980.00 → 2986.00] Ablauts wants to know if I will ever do a 4x GTX 680 versus 2x GTX 690 test.
[2986.00 → 2994.00] The answer is no, because it doesn't matter. Um, the GTX 680 and the GTX 690 have exactly the same number of functional units.
[2994.00 → 3003.00] Which means that, and they're both going to be in 4-way SLI, so there's no, there's no mystical sort of anything going on here.
[3003.00 → 3011.00] The performance will be the same. And the price is the same. So, yeah, whatever. Just buy whichever one that you like.
[3011.00 → 3019.00] Uh, the 690 won't overclock as well. The 680s will overclock better. So, yeah, bear that in mind.
[3019.00 → 3027.00] Moving right along. Would I recommend a 2500K or 3570K for moderate gaming?
[3027.00 → 3032.00] They're both pretty similar with the 3570K being a little better. Um, and also a little bit more expensive.
[3032.00 → 3038.00] Rob wants a personal rig update. If he watched my YouTube videos, he would know that, actually, no, he wouldn't know.
[3038.00 → 3041.00] If he was subscribed on Twitter, if he was following me on Twitter, he would know.
[3041.00 → 3050.00] I have found a motherboard. The X79S UP5 Wi-Fi is going to be my motherboard. It is absolutely silent.
[3050.00 → 3053.00] And, uh, and is just awesome.
[3053.00 → 3060.00] Day, Linus, did Esther introduce you to your now wife or did your wife introduce you to Esther, and she happened to be in NCI?
[3060.00 → 3069.00] I got Esther her job at NCI. I've been with NCI for six years. If you guys go back and find out, sort of, when Esther started at NCI, it was only a few years ago.
[3069.00 → 3078.00] So, at that time, I was already, I was either engaged or in a serious relationship with her sister and I, uh, I knew that Esther had the thing for, you know, social media.
[3078.00 → 3084.00] So, that was, uh, that was what went down. That was how it happened.
[3084.00 → 3087.00] There are two staff members in here. Staff members of what?
[3087.00 → 3091.00] Can you tell in some way that there are staff members? Like, how does this work?
[3094.00 → 3102.00] I'm just curious. Like, are they marked? Are they...oh, the wrench! Fuzzy Otter balls?
[3102.00 → 3113.00] Are you all just totally inappropriate? Why do you have names, like, that involve, like...yeah, see, you're talking about Ending here?
[3113.00 → 3120.00] Totally inappropriate. You're banned. I should ban you. Can I ban a staff member? I'm going to try, just for fun.
[3120.00 → 3125.00] I'm going to bring this over here so you guys can all see what happens if I try to kick a staff member.
[3125.00 → 3131.00] Invoice, ban. Did it work? Oh my goodness, it worked. Okay, can I unban him?
[3131.00 → 3139.00] Oops, uh-oh, uh-oh. Uh-oh. Hold on. Hold on. I'm trying to unban him. I can't do it. Furthermore, I can't. It's moving too fast.
[3139.00 → 3142.00] You guys are moving it too fast.
[3144.00 → 3147.00] Oh, he says, no, I'm not banned. Okay. Well, now we know what happens.
[3147.00 → 3154.00] It tells me he's banned, but it doesn't actually ban him. So, we have learned something today, if nothing else.
[3154.00 → 3162.00] Elmo Riggs wants to know if I am going to Malaysia anytime soon. I may be going to Malaysia sometime soon.
[3162.00 → 3166.00] There's a family reunion sometime next year, and I might go, or I might not.
[3166.00 → 3172.00] Joel, Joel, your question is legendary for a number of reasons.
[3172.00 → 3179.00] Are they twin sisters? No, but they're Asian. And if you're white, then you probably think they all look the same anyway.
[3179.00 → 3185.00] And that is very insensitive of you. They are not twins.
[3186.00 → 3192.00] Linus, this is a Tied. Yeah, that's probably a worthwhile upgrade.
[3192.00 → 3197.00] Hehehehehehe.
[3197.00 → 3202.00] Polska wants to know my opinion on the Fractal Core 1000. Great question.
[3202.00 → 3210.00] I believe I have a video about this. If I could figure out how to...oh. Did I break it?
[3210.00 → 3213.00] Is the livestream working? Did I switch to the wrong scene?
[3213.00 → 3219.00] Oh, oh, okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. And...ah, there we go. Yes.
[3219.00 → 3223.00] I have a video about this. If you search for Core 1000...
[3223.00 → 3230.00] My search rankings are so good. Fractal Design. Core 1000. Top hit.
[3230.00 → 3240.00] You just got...you just got dammed. So many people ask me for...ask me for, like, recommendations, or like, ask me to do videos about stuff,
[3240.00 → 3244.00] only to discover that I have already done a video about it.
[3245.00 → 3249.00] And then there's New egg's video. Look at those guys. Look at Paul's arms.
[3250.00 → 3259.00] In all seriousness, though, I like Paul. But see? He has 24,000 views and I have 45,000 views. Ha!
[3259.00 → 3264.00] But again, in all seriousness, Paul's a good guy. Let's go back to Twitter.
[3264.00 → 3270.00] There we go. I should just be using the same browser for this so that I don't have to, like, break it every time.
[3270.00 → 3276.00] Ah, Sign wants to know if I've ever answered this, but what is my opinion about RAM disks?
[3276.00 → 3281.00] My opinion is that they're not really that useful unless you have a lot of RAM.
[3281.00 → 3286.00] So I haven't really gotten to that yet. Chris has a great question. Chris.
[3286.00 → 3289.00] Linus, do you think ARM will ever expand into the desktop market?
[3289.00 → 3298.00] Absolutely, but not directly. ARM does not actually make...make processors that go into products.
[3298.00 → 3305.00] They rely on their partners, such as NVIDIA, to integrate ARM processors with some of the other components that are needed to build the system on a chip.
[3305.00 → 3315.00] And I believe that many of those partners are definitely expecting desktop computers to happen with ARM technology powering them.
[3315.00 → 3319.00] We're going to see great power efficiency and good enough performance.
[3319.00 → 3324.00] Although, I suspect for anyone watching this stream or subscribed to my channel, that performance won't be good enough.
[3324.00 → 3332.00] But there we go. Adam West. I didn't mean I wanted to use the IGP of the i3.
[3332.00 → 3335.00] I meant I wanted to use it for the processing power. Then in that case, yes.
[3335.00 → 3339.00] An i3 is a perfectly valid choice for a gaming machine.
[3339.00 → 3345.00] The one drawback is that you won't be able to overclock, really.
[3345.00 → 3349.00] Peter has a great question. Peter Silverer Burger.
[3349.00 → 3351.00] Really? Silber Burger?
[3351.00 → 3357.00] GTX 680 is main card. Would a GTX 560 Ti be good for a dedicated physics card, or would it throttle the system?
[3357.00 → 3369.00] No throttling, but I don't see the point. Because your GTX 680 is already so powerful that by the time it, like, allocates a little bit of its power for processing physics stuff,
[3369.00 → 3373.00] then it won't actually detract from the overall performance that much.
[3373.00 → 3383.00] I actually did a really, oh, I did a really cool test back when Batman Arkham Asylum launched, where I used a passive 8800 GT as a Phys card,
[3383.00 → 3391.00] and the temperature on the card while running the game with maximum Phys on didn't change.
[3391.00 → 3395.00] Which suggests to me that there's not a lot of processing going on.
[3395.00 → 3399.00] Although, newer games like Borderlands 2 might be different.
[3399.00 → 3411.00] Heisenberg, I did not bash you on the livestream. I just said that I would be immortalized on the internet, in part due to you.
[3411.00 → 3417.00] Heisenberg is the guy who made that video. See, he's in the Twitch TV chat.
[3417.00 → 3429.00] Strikes asks me, what do I think of Maxi Shine? Maxi Shine is the bloke, right? The Maxi Shine.
[3429.00 → 3435.00] Oh no, wait, no, I don't, hold on. What's Maxi Shine again? Maxi Shine.
[3435.00 → 3445.00] Oh no, that's not the one I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of TrueBradar. I don't know. Furthermore, I don't know if I think a lot about Maxi Shine.
[3445.00 → 3454.00] Wow, he's got a lot of subscribers, actually. Here's a cool tool, you guys. I don't know if you've, actually here, I'm going to switch to my other scene here.
[3454.00 → 3464.00] There we go. Check this out. This is what I use to track, to track, uh, blade.com slash YouTube slash user slash Linus Tech Tips.
[3464.00 → 3470.00] So this is what I use to track YouTube junk. It's actually just this phenomenally cool tool.
[3470.00 → 3480.00] So you can see the daily change in subscribers, video views, uh, channel views. You can see trends over time, which is really, really cool.
[3480.00 → 3487.00] This number is totally meaningless, guys. Don't, don't assume that it, you know, Social Blade doesn't suck. I use it. I like it.
[3487.00 → 3499.00] So, whatever. All because of gamer name Dirac, I'm not going to talk about it anymore. There. Black screen for you.
[3499.00 → 3503.00] Nah, I'm just messing. No black screen. Let's go back to Twitter.
[3503.00 → 3510.00] Okay. Chaz wants to know, what do you think would be the best time to buy or build a PC? Black Friday is coming up, and I was wondering if that's a good idea.
[3510.00 → 3519.00] Absolutely, Black Friday is an excellent time to, um, to, sorry, someone says they're a ten-year-old moderator.
[3519.00 → 3524.00] I don't care, as long as you're willing to be more mature than that guy who was posting crap last time around.
[3524.00 → 3531.00] Um, yes, Black Friday is an excellent time to build a PC because there are great prices.
[3531.00 → 3535.00] Michael wants to know, how do I know Slick? Was he a friend before you worked at NCI?
[3535.00 → 3541.00] Actually, Slick and I did not know each other before he came to work at NCI.
[3541.00 → 3546.00] In fact, if you, uh, check this out.
[3546.00 → 3553.00] So, um, tech tips, assistant. This is no longer live because I'm no longer looking for an assistant, and I'd have people
[3553.00 → 3560.00] messaging me all the time. But this is the video. This was the video, uh, job, uh, job posting that I created
[3560.00 → 3570.00] in order to, uh, in order to have, here we go, someone join me on tech tips.
[3570.00 → 3578.00] So I basically said I needed someone who could work flexible hours and who was technical and, uh, and that my old, yeah,
[3578.00 → 3584.00] and that my old, whatever it's called thing, my old cameraman wasn't going to be able to help me anymore
[3584.00 → 3589.00] because he was just too darn busy. And that was, uh, that was how the recruitment process went.
[3589.00 → 3595.00] And Slick was out of, actually I got a ton of applicants, many of which who were awesome.
[3595.00 → 3602.00] Like I had, um, ten people I think or so that I, that I interviewed, and I had probably twenty or thirty resumes
[3602.00 → 3608.00] that were good enough to interview, but I just had to, I had to narrow it down.
[3608.00 → 3617.00] Had to narrow it down. Yeah. Yeah.
[3617.00 → 3623.00] Alright, moving right along. Will there be any tech tips for unboxing on the NVIDIA GTX 660?
[3623.00 → 3627.00] Are you freaking kidding me? Do I have to school you again?
[3627.00 → 3629.00] Alright, schooling time. Here we go.
[3629.00 → 3635.00] We're going to go on the YouTube, and we're going to search for GTX 660.
[3635.00 → 3637.00] We're going to see what comes up.
[3637.00 → 3640.00] Aww, New egg beat me.
[3640.00 → 3644.00] There's me. Bam.
[3644.00 → 3649.00] Oh no, that's 660 Ti. Okay, okay, okay. I got, I got owned there. I got owned.
[3649.00 → 3655.00] 660 Ti. See, that's the thing about NVIDIA's naming scheme that sort of irks me.
[3655.00 → 3658.00] There we go. NVIDIA GTX 660 video card introduction.
[3658.00 → 3662.00] And there's probably more. There's probably an unboxing.
[3662.00 → 3666.00] GTX 660 video review. See, these are all front page results, guys.
[3666.00 → 3671.00] Um, yeah, so there's at least two front page results from me.
[3671.00 → 3674.00] Oh, there's the unboxing. Oh no, that's motherboards.org. Okay.
[3674.00 → 3678.00] Their thumbnail's similar to mine. Good old Eric.
[3678.00 → 3682.00] But yeah, there's plenty of, plenty of content about GTX 660.
[3682.00 → 3684.00] So, feel free to check it out.
[3684.00 → 3688.00] And if you, uh, if you don't already know about it, check out Hardware Canucks.
[3688.00 → 3691.00] They do fantastic video reviews.
[3691.00 → 3693.00] Fantastic video, or not video reviews.
[3693.00 → 3696.00] Fantastic written reviews that are, that are great.
[3696.00 → 3698.00] And just awesome.
[3698.00 → 3701.00] Garrett Moore. You really know your tech stuff.
[3701.00 → 3703.00] So why do you use an iPhone over an Android phone?
[3703.00 → 3706.00] And I, uh, because I like it.
[3706.00 → 3710.00] What do you want me to say? It's, it's outstanding.
[3710.00 → 3712.00] It's a great experience.
[3712.00 → 3714.00] As a, as a user. I, I enjoy it.
[3714.00 → 3716.00] So, ha.
[3716.00 → 3718.00] You can think of that what you will.
[3718.00 → 3720.00] Or what you not will.
[3720.00 → 3722.00] Okay. We have time for one more question.
[3722.00 → 3725.00] And we are pretty much done here.
[3725.00 → 3729.00] So I am going to take the first tweet.
[3729.00 → 3730.00] The one that's at the top.
[3730.00 → 3732.00] Once I click refresh.
[3732.00 → 3733.00] Uh, oh wait. Hold on.
[3733.00 → 3735.00] Okay. One more question from, from Twitch.
[3735.00 → 3737.00] So, Linus, do you actually play video games?
[3737.00 → 3739.00] If yes, what are you currently playing?
[3739.00 → 3741.00] I am replaying Super Mario RPG right now.
[3741.00 → 3743.00] That is a video game.
[3743.00 → 3749.00] But it is not a particularly new one.
[3749.00 → 3753.00] Someone wants me to answer Truly S?
[3753.00 → 3756.00] Um, no.
[3756.00 → 3759.00] Uh, no.
[3759.00 → 3761.00] No, no, no.
[3761.00 → 3763.00] No, I don't see anything that I like.
[3763.00 → 3765.00] Okay. Okay. I'm going to click it.
[3765.00 → 3766.00] I'm going to click it.
[3766.00 → 3767.00] Here we go. The top one.
[3767.00 → 3769.00] Oh, come on.
[3769.00 → 3773.00] Hey Linus, any idea when the next warehouse sale in Richmond will be?
[3773.00 → 3775.00] I answered this question earlier in the live stream.
[3775.00 → 3777.00] You need to tune in on time.
[3777.00 → 3780.00] You wasted the last question for everyone.
[3783.00 → 3784.00] Alright. New one.
[3784.00 → 3787.00] Alex, do you have a favourite antivirus program?
[3787.00 → 3793.00] Yes. Malwarebytes was the one that I was able to clear out my, um, my stupid keylogger with.
[3793.00 → 3798.00] I also had a problem with my desktop recently that it was able to take care of for me as well.
[3798.00 → 3799.00] So, malware bytes.
[3799.00 → 3800.00] There we go.
[3800.00 → 3807.00] Thank you for checking out this live stream on Twitch TV or if you're watching this later on YouTube.
[3807.00 → 3812.00] Don't forget that you can tune into live streams at Linus Tech on Twitch TV.
[3812.00 → 3820.00] Or if you follow me on Twitter with the at symbol Linus Tech, then you will get tweets from me about random things,
[3820.00 → 3823.00] mostly tech related. I think I do an okay job of that.
[3823.00 → 3832.00] Mostly tech related, but, um, also other things including prior notification of when the live streams will be.
[3832.00 → 3834.00] So, good night everybody. Thank you for tuning in.
[3834.00 → 3842.00] And don't forget to subscribe to me at every possible place because I actually do different content everywhere.
[3842.00 → 3848.00] NCIXTechTipsChannel, LinusTechTipsChannel, Twitter, and here on Twitch.
[3848.00 → 3850.00] Good night everybody.
[3850.00 → 3854.00] Good night.
[3854.00 → 3871.00] Good night.
