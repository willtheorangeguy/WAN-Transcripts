[0.00 → 0.72] Oh, we're streaming.
[1.90 → 2.76] That's awesome.
[4.64 → 5.34] I don't know, you want to roll?
[5.82 → 6.48] Zero viewers.
[7.36 → 9.00] I don't know if my, uh...
[10.18 → 11.84] I don't know if my input's working, though.
[12.56 → 12.86] Oh.
[13.28 → 13.70] Hold on.
[14.94 → 15.20] Up.
[16.96 → 17.82] Yeah, it's working.
[18.08 → 18.76] Zero viewers.
[19.86 → 20.70] We might come back.
[22.38 → 23.20] Let's switch work.
[25.72 → 27.86] Do I just not have control because I'm player two?
[28.46 → 28.90] Maybe.
[29.40 → 29.58] Here.
[30.00 → 30.50] Here.
[36.68 → 37.70] Two-player game.
[39.96 → 40.44] Oh.
[40.74 → 41.26] Oh, what?
[41.38 → 42.54] Oh, I restarted it.
[44.64 → 45.12] Reset.
[45.32 → 45.98] Are you sure?
[46.12 → 46.72] Yeah, I'm sure.
[48.54 → 49.46] Yeah, I'd be sure.
[49.68 → 51.48] They're back ends up.
[52.12 → 54.66] They're back ends up, but the website's still down.
[55.84 → 57.00] So we won't get any...
[57.00 → 58.04] Oh, 326 viewers.
[58.04 → 59.40] Yeah, apparently there are people watching.
[59.40 → 60.72] Is the Twitch chat working?
[60.86 → 61.48] Are people there?
[62.12 → 63.36] Um, let me check.
[63.56 → 64.50] I don't know how they're watching.
[64.62 → 65.42] I can't get to the website.
[65.42 → 69.64] We are alive, I think.
[69.64 → 71.42] Are you here?
[71.42 → 76.42] Only one way to find out for sure.
[77.14 → 78.98] Maybe the chat service is still there?
[81.80 → 82.32] Um...
[82.32 → 87.44] Apparently there are 576 viewers.
[87.44 → 89.16] It's going up.
[89.16 → 89.82] Hello?
[89.82 → 90.06] Hello?
[90.06 → 90.16] Hello?
[90.16 → 91.06] Hello?
[91.06 → 91.16] Hello?
[91.16 → 91.66] Hello?
[91.66 → 92.16] Hello?
[92.16 → 92.66] Hello?
[92.66 → 93.16] Hello?
[93.16 → 94.16] Are you there?
[94.16 → 94.66] Hello?
[94.66 → 95.16] Hello?
[95.16 → 95.66] Hello?
[95.66 → 96.94] Are you there?
[96.94 → 97.44] Yep.
[97.44 → 98.04] You're live.
[98.04 → 99.76] They left the window open, apparently.
[99.76 → 100.76] They left the window open, apparently.
[100.76 → 102.46] That's how we can watch.
[102.46 → 103.46] Ballin'.
[103.46 → 105.04] Alright, you're up.
[105.04 → 106.04] Cool.
[106.04 → 107.04] Is this working?
[107.04 → 108.54] I don't know what the volume's like.
[108.54 → 110.54] And we don't have Twitch chat to get...
[110.54 → 112.12] Apparently we're going to have to navigate through Twitter.
[112.12 → 112.96] How are things going?
[112.96 → 114.30] Stream is fine apparently.
[114.30 → 115.30] Alright.
[115.30 → 116.58] So audio and everything's good?
[116.58 → 117.64] Let's move this laptop.
[117.64 → 119.04] Let's probably hope.
[119.04 → 121.54] We have a completely different setup this week.
[121.54 → 123.54] Like it's completely different.
[123.54 → 127.86] I opened up the aperture on the camera, but I think it's actually gotten enough dimmer now
[127.86 → 128.86] that it hasn't popped up.
[128.86 → 129.86] It already doesn't really have...
[129.86 → 133.36] So I kind of want to finish this game today.
[133.36 → 136.08] That's part of the reason why I really wanted to do the after party today.
[136.08 → 137.40] Because I want to move on to something else.
[137.40 → 138.40] Me too.
[138.40 → 139.40] What do you want to do next?
[139.40 → 141.40] I have no idea, but we can't really do Nintendo.
[141.40 → 142.40] Why not?
[142.40 → 143.40] Well, whatever.
[143.40 → 149.16] It's not like we were going to make our first million by streaming video games.
[149.16 → 153.86] Although, with that said I shouldn't mock it either because PewDiePie is clearly already
[153.86 → 157.24] a billionaire from streaming games.
[157.24 → 158.42] What are you doing?
[158.42 → 159.42] You need this spring.
[159.42 → 160.42] Ohhhhh.
[160.42 → 162.54] Okay, that's all fine and good, but what are you doing?
[162.54 → 164.42] There we go.
[164.42 → 165.42] You're dead.
[165.42 → 166.42] I was trying to dodge the spring.
[166.42 → 167.42] You're so dead.
[167.42 → 168.42] You're dead.
[168.42 → 169.42] You're just dead.
[169.42 → 170.42] Let me just play.
[170.42 → 171.42] It might help.
[171.42 → 172.42] No.
[172.42 → 173.42] No, no, no.
[173.42 → 174.26] It might.
[174.26 → 176.18] Trolling is part of the process for gaming.
[176.18 → 177.18] Is it?
[177.18 → 178.18] Not really.
[178.18 → 179.18] Come on.
[179.18 → 180.18] If you're a jerk.
[180.18 → 181.18] Okay.
[181.18 → 183.88] Trolling is part of the process if you're gaming with me.
[183.88 → 184.88] You're dead.
[184.88 → 185.88] Ohhhh.
[185.88 → 186.88] You're dead.
[186.88 → 188.64] Oh, you're dead.
[188.64 → 189.64] You're dead.
[189.64 → 190.64] Oh, you're dead.
[190.64 → 196.64] Okay, so for Mr. Wants to take the high road, you're doing an awful lot of trolling yourself
[196.64 → 197.64] over there.
[197.64 → 198.64] I'm just showing you how low that road actually is.
[198.64 → 203.76] I'm just showing you how when you're going to criticize someone, maybe you should actually
[203.76 → 206.40] be better yourself rather than just criticizing someone.
[206.40 → 207.40] I made it further than you did.
[207.40 → 208.40] Twice now.
[208.40 → 209.40] That is true.
[209.40 → 211.40] I have a girlfriend.
[211.40 → 212.40] Actually, I don't.
[212.40 → 213.40] I have a wife, which is sort of different.
[213.40 → 214.40] Not as good.
[214.40 → 215.40] She's not watching right now.
[215.40 → 216.40] She's at work.
[216.40 → 217.40] She's not going to watch the archive.
[217.40 → 218.40] You're home.
[218.40 → 219.40] No, no.
[219.40 → 220.40] She never watches the after party.
[220.40 → 221.40] Oh, okay.
[221.40 → 222.40] Yeah.
[222.40 → 223.40] That's how I get away with things.
[223.40 → 224.40] Those little flame things are annoying.
[224.40 → 225.40] So annoying.
[225.40 → 226.40] Like, you can't even see them when they're behind the trees.
[226.40 → 227.40] You're going to die.
[227.40 → 228.40] Why do you think you need this spring?
[228.40 → 230.40] I don't remember, but I think I do.
[230.40 → 232.40] Alright, well, I guess all we can really do is take Twitter questions since the Twitch
[232.40 → 233.40] chat isn't live.
[233.40 → 234.40] Um...
[234.40 → 235.40] Oh, no.
[235.40 → 236.40] Oh, no.
[236.40 → 237.40] Oh, no.
[237.40 → 238.40] Oh, no.
[238.40 → 239.40] Oh, no.
[239.40 → 240.40] Oh, no.
[240.40 → 241.40] Oh, no.
[241.40 → 242.40] Oh, no.
[242.40 → 243.40] Oh, no.
[243.40 → 244.40] Oh, no.
[244.40 → 245.40] Oh, no.
[245.40 → 246.40] Oh, no.
[246.40 → 247.40] Oh, no.
[247.40 → 248.40] Oh, no.
[248.40 → 249.40] Oh, no.
[249.40 → 250.40] Oh, no.
[250.40 → 251.40] Oh, no.
[251.40 → 252.40] Oh, no.
[252.40 → 253.40] Oh, no.
[253.40 → 254.40] Oh, no.
[254.40 → 255.40] Oh, no.
[255.40 → 256.40] Are you dead again?
[256.40 → 257.40] Yeah.
[257.40 → 260.40] We need some power-ups, because I think that's part of the problem here.
[260.40 → 261.40] Very possibly.
[261.40 → 272.40] So, anyway, should we do- is there a way feasibly for us to play PC games together, on the same
[272.40 → 275.40] stream, at the same time?
[275.40 → 278.40] Could we have?
[278.40 → 283.40] We have three, uh, capture cards.
[283.40 → 286.12] Okay.
[287.72 → 290.78] What PC games would you want to play?
[291.40 → 291.90] Oh, white.
[292.32 → 292.82] Oh, white.
[293.18 → 293.88] Ah, white.
[295.18 → 296.02] Um, I don't know.
[297.60 → 300.18] We could play, you know, a game or two.
[300.40 → 302.12] No, I think you need another one or something.
[302.82 → 304.52] Ah, ah, ah, ah!
[304.70 → 305.20] Boom!
[306.06 → 306.50] Headshot!
[306.50 → 306.92] Oh, no, okay.
[306.98 → 308.54] It was just an alternate way of getting up that.
[309.54 → 310.18] Never mind, though.
[310.62 → 311.42] Ah, okay.
[311.56 → 312.08] There's a fish.
[312.56 → 313.16] You're dead.
[313.40 → 317.26] Oh, you're not cool.
[317.42 → 317.54] Oh.
[317.98 → 319.76] Ah, ah, no!
[320.64 → 321.10] Close.
[321.88 → 323.90] Okay, so if we had three capture cards,
[324.54 → 328.78] could we both sit here on notebooks,
[329.74 → 331.32] play a game with each other?
[331.36 → 333.08] Maybe we could even have viewers play.
[333.56 → 335.34] We could be like, yeah, we're on this server or whatever.
[335.34 → 338.02] And then the Aver media capture card
[338.02 → 339.90] could take the input from the FS.
[341.82 → 342.26] Okay.
[342.26 → 344.12] Could that work?
[344.44 → 344.96] I hate gaming.
[345.08 → 346.36] We don't have two gaming laptops.
[347.00 → 351.62] We have one gaming laptop, and you can use your laptop.
[351.96 → 352.76] My laptop's...
[352.76 → 354.76] I like winning.
[354.76 → 354.78] I like winning.
[354.78 → 355.46] Wow.
[355.46 → 356.46] Rude.
[356.46 → 365.56] Someone says there's blur on the camera's lower side.
[365.56 → 367.68] I think it's just dark.
[368.24 → 369.78] And fix the Mario screen region.
[370.10 → 373.36] Nothing we can do about the Mario screen region, unfortunately, this time around,
[373.36 → 376.94] because we are not using the Aver media card,
[377.00 → 380.66] which has a little bit more flexibility in terms of input resolutions and whatnot.
[380.88 → 382.72] It's more optimized for...
[382.72 → 383.86] Oh, you're going the wrong way, I think.
[384.20 → 385.46] It's more optimized for gaming,
[385.54 → 387.66] whereas we're using the Black magic Intensity Pro now
[387.66 → 389.34] because we're using our stream PC.
[390.94 → 394.42] And unfortunately, this looks like the best we can do for now.
[397.62 → 399.44] We're both at like three lives or something.
[399.52 → 400.04] Someone says,
[400.04 → 402.22] Thanks for reading my tweet out loud.
[402.34 → 403.26] I needed out a bit.
[403.40 → 403.90] Hi, Alex.
[404.84 → 405.28] Hello.
[405.46 → 406.56] Got an HTC One.
[406.64 → 407.40] Following your praises.
[407.60 → 409.14] Best decision ever made.
[409.62 → 410.94] It's a good freaking phone.
[410.96 → 411.64] It's a good phone.
[411.76 → 411.80] I'm super happy.
[411.80 → 415.72] One of my favourite things still is the haptic feedback when you type on it.
[415.80 → 416.26] Oh, it's awesome.
[416.30 → 417.56] It's so nice.
[421.00 → 424.40] We're not just streaming another website like Justin TV or Stream.
[425.88 → 428.02] Because no one really follows us there,
[428.02 → 434.02] and then we'd have to re-ka jigger all the surrounding messaging.
[434.10 → 435.92] It's easier to just use one platform.
[436.04 → 437.22] Twitch doesn't go down very often,
[437.38 → 440.54] so I'm not super worried that it's going to be an ongoing problem.
[443.00 → 445.30] So we filmed a lot of NCI Tech Tips today.
[446.82 → 451.42] Did I tell you that we actually filmed a Samsonite showcase?
[451.62 → 451.94] Wow.
[452.42 → 452.82] Wow.
[453.08 → 453.62] Just wow.
[453.74 → 455.02] I was trying to do something weird,
[455.14 → 456.18] and it turned out terrible.
[456.20 → 456.96] I wasn't even looking.
[456.96 → 458.96] We did a...
[458.96 → 459.40] Nope.
[459.50 → 461.08] Can't fix the screen region on XSplit
[461.08 → 461.96] because it is actually...
[462.54 → 466.04] Those black bars are part of the actual capture region.
[466.46 → 469.04] So if I shrink it horizontally,
[469.34 → 470.90] then it will shrink vertically as well.
[471.36 → 472.58] So nothing I can do, guys.
[472.64 → 472.86] Sorry.
[473.96 → 475.94] What was I saying just now?
[476.52 → 477.12] No, no, no.
[478.08 → 478.88] Oh my goodness.
[478.94 → 479.30] What am I doing?
[480.82 → 482.94] Screen regions, capture cards,
[483.38 → 485.96] HTC One, something, good phone.
[485.96 → 487.38] We're going to run out of lives.
[487.86 → 488.94] We're going to run out of lives.
[489.40 → 491.44] This will be the first time we've actually died.
[492.44 → 493.58] We should have just saved state.
[493.70 → 495.04] Oh, I thought we did save state.
[496.06 → 497.70] Oh, we should just go back to our save state.
[498.22 → 498.46] Okay.
[498.82 → 499.42] Open state.
[500.96 → 501.90] Okay, load state.
[502.46 → 502.90] Boom.
[503.12 → 504.12] Where did we save state?
[504.80 → 505.92] Oh wow, tons of lives.
[505.92 → 509.10] Yeah, but just more lives so we don't have to go back.
[509.46 → 510.58] And it's my turn again.
[511.14 → 511.54] Sweet.
[513.28 → 513.60] Sure.
[515.60 → 517.74] I said you should do live streams with me.
[517.86 → 520.30] I didn't say it will be fun to do live streams with me.
[520.30 → 524.52] Oh my goodness, what am I doing?
[524.72 → 525.60] That area sucks.
[525.90 → 527.00] What am I doing?
[527.30 → 528.22] What am I doing?
[529.10 → 530.64] I'm like a crazy man.
[530.78 → 532.16] We could probably do the gaming stream thing.
[532.26 → 537.32] How do people do it where they stream with two camera inputs that are in totally different locations?
[538.40 → 539.64] Is that like a Skype?
[539.92 → 540.88] Some type of Skype thing?
[540.88 → 542.38] Two camera inputs with...
[542.38 → 543.32] Oh, probably.
[543.66 → 543.84] Yeah?
[544.24 → 547.36] Yeah, so you would want a game on like your PC or something, I guess.
[547.62 → 548.80] I don't know.
[548.88 → 550.38] I'm just trying to think of options.
[550.78 → 552.70] I wonder how many people are actually watching.
[554.16 → 556.44] Oh yeah, Samsonite Showcase on NCI.
[556.60 → 557.04] Thanks, Mark.
[557.38 → 563.14] So the Samsonite Showcase on NCI was interesting because at first I was like, really?
[563.58 → 565.50] We're going to do a Samsonite Showcase.
[565.58 → 567.96] We're going to show a bunch of like laptop bags and stuff.
[569.00 → 571.04] And NCI was like, yeah.
[571.26 → 572.90] And I'm like, okay.
[573.32 → 575.54] Uh, okay.
[576.22 → 577.70] And they were like, yeah, yeah, go for it.
[577.78 → 579.50] So I filmed the thing.
[579.96 → 583.84] And as I'm going, I started to be like, oh yeah, some of these features are kind of cool.
[584.52 → 589.40] Like there's padding on the inside of one of them that's super nice.
[589.80 → 595.34] And there's another one that has those wheels that are like casters and move in all directions.
[595.86 → 598.86] And so I was like, oh, okay, yeah, some of these features are actually kind of cool.
[599.24 → 602.52] And then I was mostly focused on filming it.
[602.52 → 605.74] So the funny thing is, you know what Diesel told me when he was done editing it?
[606.60 → 609.78] He's like, yeah, I'm kind of sold on Samsonite stuff now.
[610.32 → 611.14] I was like, really?
[611.44 → 611.62] Yeah.
[611.62 → 620.52] I told you before you started shooting that I had seen some of their mainly laptop sleeves in the past that had some fascinating, like it looked like sound dampening.
[620.84 → 622.84] The cone kind of style that sound dampening has.
[623.04 → 624.08] That black sound dampening stuff.
[624.38 → 625.44] But it was memory foam.
[625.92 → 627.02] And it was fascinating.
[627.18 → 632.22] And like you could drop your laptop, and it would usually be fairly okay.
[632.22 → 633.58] Like obviously it's not going to be perfect.
[633.78 → 637.38] But it was pretty good, and it was really soft, and they're really nice bags.
[637.70 → 638.66] I like them a lot.
[638.90 → 641.22] So like Samsonite, actually not that bad.
[641.54 → 645.94] But I don't know how interested I would be as a viewer to watch a showcase on bags.
[646.18 → 648.16] But apparently it is interesting.
[648.70 → 649.76] Apparently it's interesting.
[649.94 → 650.54] So there you go.
[651.16 → 652.46] Learn something every day.
[653.14 → 653.94] Oh crap.
[653.94 → 655.72] Nasty times.
[655.78 → 656.76] I hate that one in the bottom.
[656.78 → 657.18] Oh I should just go get that one.
[657.80 → 658.22] Yeah.
[659.42 → 661.62] Yeah I should just go get that jumper thing.
[662.80 → 663.08] Yep.
[665.52 → 669.90] Based on how few people are watching.
[671.58 → 677.36] Well someone even said it's just the people that had the thing open already.
[677.76 → 678.88] Yeah but I think that.
[678.88 → 684.70] I think that based on how few tweets I'm getting.
[685.20 → 687.96] Most of those people probably just like left the stream open.
[688.08 → 689.24] But then like wandered away.
[689.94 → 690.18] Yeah.
[697.66 → 698.18] Whoa.
[699.32 → 699.88] Man.
[703.36 → 704.38] We got worse.
[705.30 → 707.96] I know we were burning through these special levels.
[707.96 → 708.56] Perfect.
[708.70 → 709.94] And then we took a really long break.
[710.04 → 710.22] Ah.
[710.66 → 711.52] You know what stupid though?
[711.54 → 713.46] No we have to do an SNES game next.
[713.86 → 715.96] Because I bought that stupid SNES adapter.
[716.28 → 717.62] Specifically so we could do this.
[718.40 → 719.52] And so yeah.
[719.64 → 721.68] I want to get my money's worth out of it.
[721.96 → 723.40] But then I forgot to bring it today.
[725.02 → 725.82] That was nice Joe.
[726.76 → 727.12] Bye.
[727.20 → 727.60] Thank you.
[728.68 → 730.02] I also thought so.
[733.60 → 736.34] I love how when they crouch they just look like they're on the can.
[736.48 → 736.68] Yeah.
[737.96 → 739.64] I don't use the can like that.
[740.14 → 741.44] Oh come on.
[741.78 → 743.04] Come on.
[745.04 → 745.48] Ah.
[745.72 → 746.12] Ooh.
[747.18 → 748.38] Three bolts in a line.
[748.60 → 749.58] Nothing I could do there.
[751.32 → 755.90] I think that guy that does all level backwards while crouched while jumping would tell you otherwise.
[755.90 → 760.50] Who cares if not many people watching keep streaming.
[762.98 → 765.48] Any idea if there's going to be a 780 with more RAM?
[765.54 → 767.98] I wouldn't be that surprised if someone did a 6 gig one.
[769.26 → 771.48] I mean I know that Nvidia has unlike Titan.
[771.86 → 776.42] Nvidia has opened up the possibility for board partners to do different 780s.
[776.42 → 780.48] Oh do you want to tell us about some of your other Korean adventures?
[783.18 → 786.04] I can tell you more about the changing of the guard thing.
[786.10 → 786.32] Sure.
[786.32 → 787.44] So.
[788.50 → 790.04] Like what changing of what guard?
[790.14 → 790.86] Like the white guard?
[791.40 → 792.80] Like how are you involved?
[794.44 → 795.56] I didn't really fit.
[796.84 → 798.78] Like did you fit in the uniform even?
[799.20 → 799.76] You need that.
[801.00 → 802.00] Do it this spring?
[802.20 → 802.38] Yeah.
[802.66 → 802.90] Okay.
[802.90 → 803.90] Um.
[804.22 → 804.92] They had to.
[805.70 → 806.34] How do I.
[806.82 → 807.14] What?
[807.32 → 807.52] Really?
[807.76 → 809.62] Yeah you'll have to bounce on a bullet to get over the thing.
[810.18 → 811.14] What do I need it for?
[811.30 → 811.92] The yellow tier.
[812.82 → 813.74] No for before that.
[814.52 → 814.76] Really?
[814.98 → 815.24] Yeah.
[815.54 → 816.16] This is not okay.
[816.46 → 817.26] I need that for the yellow.
[818.54 → 818.98] Dining.
[820.32 → 820.76] No.
[820.76 → 820.96] Oh boy.
[821.78 → 822.48] Oh boy.
[822.66 → 823.14] Oh boy.
[823.64 → 824.18] Oh boy.
[824.86 → 825.26] Oh boy.
[825.26 → 825.34] Oh.
[825.94 → 826.26] No.
[826.26 → 827.90] There's four bullets there.
[828.28 → 828.64] Okay.
[828.82 → 829.08] So.
[830.40 → 832.56] They had to grab some special boots for me.
[832.56 → 833.22] And stuff.
[833.38 → 834.90] But like it worked out pretty alright.
[835.40 → 838.04] Actually the first pair of boots they got for me were way too big.
[838.76 → 839.18] Which I was like.
[839.70 → 840.10] What?
[840.28 → 842.04] Where did they find boots that were too big for you?
[842.06 → 842.88] You have clown feet.
[843.08 → 843.76] That's what I was thinking.
[843.76 → 846.64] I actually show Slick's shoe size in the uh.
[847.38 → 848.30] In the video.
[849.00 → 850.14] That we do the room tour.
[850.42 → 851.56] I don't know if I told you that.
[851.74 → 852.42] No you didn't.
[854.06 → 854.38] Oh.
[854.88 → 855.40] Oh well.
[855.52 → 856.60] Because I'm hardcore like that.
[857.24 → 858.02] What was I going to say?
[858.90 → 859.16] Yeah.
[859.28 → 860.10] So they dressed us up.
[860.14 → 860.86] It was nuts.
[860.86 → 863.32] There were like six layers of different stuff that they put on.
[863.42 → 864.84] And you get the big sword.
[865.34 → 866.14] And you get a bow.
[866.32 → 866.92] And a quiver.
[867.24 → 869.00] And the quiver has arrows in it.
[869.48 → 869.92] Um.
[870.32 → 870.72] Really?
[870.88 → 873.36] So you could like to take down the Korean army if you uh.
[873.44 → 873.66] You know.
[873.74 → 875.44] Decided that you were going to be hardcore about it.
[875.74 → 875.92] Or.
[876.16 → 879.00] And you could get past like one of their actually trained people.
[879.16 → 879.52] But whatever.
[879.96 → 880.30] Um.
[881.14 → 881.38] Yeah.
[881.86 → 882.52] You know.
[882.94 → 883.96] That works for you.
[884.60 → 884.92] Um.
[884.92 → 888.02] The guy that took us through was super nice.
[888.26 → 888.98] He was a great guy.
[889.46 → 890.34] But didn't know English.
[890.44 → 892.74] So it was really hard for him to teach us all the moves that we had to know.
[893.18 → 893.74] Like all the.
[893.74 → 894.24] So you have to do moves?
[894.52 → 894.68] You.
[894.84 → 896.68] Not like moves with the sword or anything.
[897.08 → 898.48] But like you had to march in certain ways.
[898.54 → 900.84] And you had to like move this thing around in certain patterns.
[901.18 → 904.72] It's part of the whole like verifying that you're who you claim to be.
[904.72 → 906.58] Because you would know this.
[906.94 → 907.04] Right.
[907.12 → 910.98] Because it's the same idea of the changing of the guard that other countries have.
[911.34 → 911.66] Right.
[912.00 → 912.30] It's.
[912.42 → 913.72] You have to verify you're the right person.
[913.82 → 914.34] Not an imposter.
[914.48 → 915.02] Blah blah blah blah blah.
[915.62 → 916.02] Um.
[916.06 → 917.74] So that they know they're getting someone on the right team.
[917.84 → 919.72] So you can't just like Trojan horse them.
[919.94 → 920.24] Basically.
[920.56 → 920.84] Right.
[921.14 → 921.62] Um.
[922.52 → 923.50] Same general idea.
[923.76 → 926.64] So we had stuff like we both had half of this wooden coin.
[927.10 → 928.98] And the wooden coin had engravings on it.
[929.48 → 930.64] So we had to put the wooden coin together.
[930.64 → 931.54] What was that?
[931.54 → 932.68] Did you see that?
[933.20 → 934.12] You died with Joshi.
[934.28 → 934.58] Yeah.
[935.24 → 936.78] I've never actually seen that before.
[938.30 → 938.48] And.
[938.64 → 939.04] And.
[939.18 → 940.48] What was that hit detection?
[941.16 → 942.16] I didn't see that.
[942.24 → 943.74] But I saw you fall off the screen with Joshi.
[944.16 → 945.24] That was ridiculous.
[948.60 → 950.58] Anyone else know what the heck just happened?
[955.40 → 956.64] That is bizarre.
[958.82 → 959.26] Hmm.
[962.50 → 963.84] What was that?
[963.84 → 964.84] Okay.
[967.42 → 967.78] Okay.
[967.78 → 968.22] You're up.
[968.54 → 969.84] I've never seen that before.
[969.96 → 970.20] No.
[970.36 → 970.96] That should be impossible.
[970.96 → 971.58] I'm scared now.
[971.78 → 973.46] This level just wants to kill us.
[973.60 → 974.48] I was doing okay.
[974.66 → 975.44] I was going to beat it.
[975.66 → 976.78] It's breaking all the rules.
[976.78 → 978.94] I was going to get Joshi, and then I was going to be fine.
[979.34 → 980.66] Because Joshi is like a boss.
[981.66 → 983.02] That was so weird.
[983.02 → 984.10] This level is cheating.
[984.10 → 986.20] I didn't even get hit by anything though.
[986.30 → 987.20] As far as I know.
[987.52 → 988.88] I'm glad we're recording this.
[989.00 → 994.52] Because I'm so calling Nintendo and complaining about the video that I'm basically stealing their content with.
[994.52 → 997.66] And basically like they don't want me to make.
[998.00 → 999.70] And with an emulated copy.
[999.90 → 1002.72] And they're going to be real upset that this game isn't performing right for me.
[1004.52 → 1006.32] That is how that's going to go down.
[1006.32 → 1009.08] You should try and be like hey you're taking my money for this anyway.
[1009.20 → 1009.94] It might as well work.
[1009.94 → 1011.14] Yeah exactly right.
[1011.86 → 1012.66] You're welcome.
[1013.12 → 1014.94] You should support this ancient product.
[1016.00 → 1019.34] I'd move faster here because otherwise that flame kind of bones you.
[1020.18 → 1021.14] Oh oh oh.
[1021.32 → 1021.58] Ah.
[1021.74 → 1022.24] No.
[1022.64 → 1022.96] Get Joshi.
[1022.96 → 1023.36] Get Joshi.
[1023.48 → 1025.26] Apparently it's like the Joshi of Doom though.
[1025.40 → 1028.80] I hate it when it lags like that.
[1029.86 → 1031.16] Why can't I get up there?
[1031.52 → 1032.44] Because it's too high.
[1032.76 → 1033.38] For one thing.
[1034.52 → 1035.22] There you go.
[1037.44 → 1037.88] No.
[1038.06 → 1038.18] No.
[1038.36 → 1038.60] Go.
[1038.74 → 1038.96] Go.
[1039.50 → 1039.92] Go.
[1040.90 → 1041.34] Go.
[1043.84 → 1045.10] Watch out for the bullet on the right.
[1045.18 → 1046.02] Better to fight him over here.
[1047.22 → 1047.76] There you go.
[1047.86 → 1048.14] Hmm.
[1048.72 → 1049.30] You'll be fine.
[1049.88 → 1050.44] You got this.
[1050.48 → 1050.90] You got this.
[1050.90 → 1051.56] I think you're at the end.
[1052.20 → 1052.60] Yay.
[1054.94 → 1056.52] Accidentally reloaded the Twitch page.
[1056.80 → 1058.90] And now watching live on iPad through Twitch app.
[1059.10 → 1059.46] Yes.
[1059.94 → 1061.42] Someone says they think the worm got me.
[1061.50 → 1062.50] But I was on Joshi.
[1063.10 → 1064.78] Unless he hit me twice.
[1065.38 → 1065.74] Of.
[1066.12 → 1066.46] See.
[1066.64 → 1067.16] Again.
[1067.16 → 1071.86] What was this?
[1071.86 → 1071.88] What was this?
[1073.56 → 1077.04] Because you should turn invincible for a short period of time.
[1078.38 → 1079.72] Sorry to do this to you guys.
[1079.78 → 1081.38] I'm going to glitch out the audio hardcore here.
[1081.38 → 1081.82] Sorry.
[1083.34 → 1083.82] Sorry.
[1084.22 → 1084.70] Sorry.
[1085.50 → 1085.98] Sorry.
[1086.28 → 1086.72] Emulation.
[1087.08 → 1087.44] Sorry.
[1087.78 → 1088.12] Sorry.
[1088.44 → 1089.60] I know that's really annoying.
[1091.68 → 1095.08] But hopefully it's less annoying than waiting the whole time for me to hike back.
[1095.08 → 1098.74] I'm afraid to get Joshi now.
[1099.20 → 1099.52] Yeah.
[1099.68 → 1100.70] That was really weird.
[1101.52 → 1102.52] Because I was there.
[1102.82 → 1104.46] The end was over the next thing.
[1105.70 → 1108.98] Well, at least if it's going to steal my finish, then it can steal yours.
[1110.90 → 1111.30] Yeah.
[1111.38 → 1113.64] Mark's like Joshi touched the caterpillar thing.
[1113.86 → 1115.00] But that's not the issue.
[1115.20 → 1115.60] Because...
[1115.60 → 1116.78] That should throw you off Joshi.
[1116.86 → 1118.18] Joshi should go for a run.
[1118.18 → 1119.18] It should throw you off.
[1119.34 → 1121.10] And then Joshi should...
[1121.10 → 1122.82] It should give you temporary invincibility.
[1123.12 → 1123.36] Yeah.
[1123.74 → 1124.00] Right?
[1124.14 → 1124.48] Or no?
[1124.64 → 1124.88] Yeah.
[1125.04 → 1126.10] That's as far as I know.
[1126.64 → 1127.10] I think so.
[1127.34 → 1127.88] Or maybe not.
[1127.92 → 1128.72] But it should throw you.
[1129.02 → 1129.72] I've never...
[1130.40 → 1131.64] No, the caterpillar...
[1131.64 → 1132.32] That's...
[1132.32 → 1134.00] Whatever his name is.
[1134.08 → 1135.00] No, he can't do...
[1135.00 → 1135.78] He's nothing special.
[1136.52 → 1138.10] This is going to be a lot easier with a cape.
[1138.94 → 1139.30] Yeah.
[1139.60 → 1141.18] I kind of wish I'd just done this before.
[1143.48 → 1143.88] And...
[1144.66 → 1145.08] Oops.
[1145.78 → 1146.90] That was the problem I had.
[1146.90 → 1148.28] I tried to bring the spring with me.
[1148.42 → 1149.30] And it got all weird.
[1150.34 → 1151.20] That's when I was like...
[1151.20 → 1152.12] I was trying to do something weird.
[1152.20 → 1153.02] And it didn't work out great.
[1153.10 → 1153.92] And I died right here.
[1154.58 → 1155.14] And then...
[1155.14 → 1155.70] Yeah.
[1156.04 → 1157.00] That's the...
[1157.00 → 1158.40] Exactly.
[1159.12 → 1159.30] Wow.
[1159.36 → 1160.20] I'm pulling a slick here.
[1162.06 → 1162.64] Come on.
[1162.72 → 1163.00] Feather.
[1163.98 → 1165.40] You've got to be kidding me.
[1166.54 → 1168.12] That's exactly what happened.
[1171.14 → 1171.88] Okay, Joshi.
[1172.64 → 1174.48] We are going to have a problem here.
[1174.48 → 1179.56] I can't believe I lost all my power-ups already.
[1180.78 → 1181.22] Joshi.
[1182.00 → 1182.32] Haha.
[1185.44 → 1185.88] Unbelievable.
[1186.60 → 1188.62] That's the exact same problems I had.
[1189.56 → 1190.28] Except...
[1190.28 → 1190.78] More...
[1190.78 → 1192.38] Strung out.
[1193.22 → 1193.66] Oh.
[1193.66 → 1194.64] It's mine ended quite quickly.
[1194.64 → 1200.32] What's the point of even hiking back and getting your power-ups if that's going to happen?
[1202.26 → 1204.12] We were doing so well last time.
[1204.20 → 1205.56] We were not doing well today.
[1205.64 → 1207.20] You know, it's been kind of a long week though.
[1207.96 → 1208.80] For me anyway.
[1209.12 → 1209.38] Yeah.
[1209.60 → 1210.00] Yeah, it has.
[1210.00 → 1213.60] Like all the moving and like...
[1213.60 → 1215.40] Moving just is draining.
[1215.96 → 1216.36] Yeah.
[1216.74 → 1217.10] Duck...
[1217.10 → 1217.88] Oh, shoot.
[1218.12 → 1219.82] I forgot I was big.
[1219.92 → 1222.44] I saw it too, and I was just like...
[1222.44 → 1223.44] Should I say something?
[1223.56 → 1224.52] No, he probably sees it.
[1224.92 → 1225.36] I just...
[1225.36 → 1225.74] Oh.
[1226.74 → 1227.60] Bad timing.
[1228.90 → 1230.52] It hadn't shot in so long.
[1230.60 → 1231.46] I was just like...
[1231.46 → 1234.26] No one is sending any questions.
[1236.66 → 1237.06] Um...
[1237.06 → 1238.34] I can keep talking about the...
[1238.34 → 1238.70] On Twitter.
[1238.82 → 1239.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1239.34 → 1240.46] Talk about your changing the guard thing.
[1240.60 → 1241.34] Alright, so...
[1241.34 → 1242.08] It's mildly interesting.
[1242.24 → 1247.14] So we have to learn like this weird rotation of where to put this like stick thing that has
[1247.14 → 1248.44] cloth coming off it.
[1248.48 → 1249.32] That's a terrible description.
[1249.32 → 1249.96] It's called a flag.
[1250.26 → 1251.04] It's not a flag.
[1251.44 → 1253.30] A stick with a cloth coming off it is called a flag.
[1254.54 → 1255.06] Um...
[1255.06 → 1256.24] It was more than one cloth.
[1256.82 → 1257.52] More than one cloth.
[1257.52 → 1258.02] More ribbony.
[1258.20 → 1260.48] Flags can have ribbony multiple...
[1260.48 → 1261.62] I don't think it was a flag.
[1261.76 → 1262.36] Flags on them.
[1262.42 → 1263.08] Pretty sure it wasn't a flag.
[1263.08 → 1264.34] I'm pretty sure that you're wrong.
[1264.80 → 1265.16] Okay.
[1265.34 → 1269.80] I'm pretty sure that based on the fact that you were there, and I wasn't, uh, I'm probably
[1269.80 → 1270.46] right about this.
[1272.64 → 1273.20] Crap!
[1273.44 → 1274.10] Oh, there you go.
[1274.50 → 1274.86] Um...
[1276.32 → 1276.72] Yeah.
[1276.90 → 1277.92] And then they're like, yeah.
[1278.32 → 1284.24] This is like chapter one and the other like weird form of doing things is chapter two.
[1284.72 → 1285.36] And Easel...
[1285.36 → 1286.26] Or...
[1286.26 → 1286.90] Whatever.
[1287.14 → 1288.70] I guess he's public but anyway.
[1288.70 → 1292.14] Uh, Diesel and I were like, uh, okay.
[1292.44 → 1296.58] So I guess we do this like once, and then we do it in a slightly different way for try number
[1296.58 → 1296.78] two.
[1296.88 → 1297.36] Not at all.
[1297.48 → 1299.76] It was like a half an hour, 35 minute process.
[1300.96 → 1307.84] But luckily, um, there was Diesel and I facing each other and then behind and to the
[1307.84 → 1311.50] right of Diesel was a guy doing the same motions as me.
[1311.50 → 1315.64] And behind and to the right of myself was a guy doing the same motions as Diesel.
[1316.28 → 1319.22] So we could see the guy in the corner of our vision doing the stuff we were supposed
[1319.22 → 1319.54] to do.
[1319.88 → 1320.28] Okay.
[1320.44 → 1322.66] So we just kind of did it but slightly delayed.
[1322.66 → 1323.06] Yeah.
[1323.38 → 1323.66] Yeah.
[1323.66 → 1323.70] Yeah.
[1323.80 → 1324.48] And it was awesome.
[1325.34 → 1329.52] And then after you go through all the motions, and you have to like, you have to take a coin
[1329.52 → 1333.78] that's split in half, put it beside each other, match the symbols, nod at each other and then
[1333.78 → 1339.66] nod at these people that like oversee everything and like, oh, what the how did, uh, how do I...
[1340.38 → 1340.96] What are you doing?
[1341.62 → 1342.08] There you go.
[1342.16 → 1342.76] Did you do that?
[1342.80 → 1342.94] Nope.
[1343.00 → 1343.70] I fixed it for you.
[1343.86 → 1344.18] Okay.
[1344.18 → 1348.24] I pressed almost all the buttons on my controller, and it didn't change anything.
[1348.72 → 1348.96] Um.
[1348.96 → 1349.42] Ah, start.
[1349.98 → 1350.42] Oh, okay.
[1351.56 → 1352.50] What was I going to say?
[1352.96 → 1353.24] Yeah.
[1353.42 → 1356.76] So it was really, really long but kind of cool.
[1356.76 → 1356.84] Was it hard?
[1357.80 → 1358.88] It wasn't that hard, actually.
[1359.24 → 1359.46] No?
[1359.72 → 1360.12] Um.
[1360.12 → 1361.40] More like a flaccid ceremony?
[1361.64 → 1361.86] Mm-hmm.
[1362.50 → 1363.10] Um.
[1363.40 → 1364.02] What was I going to say?
[1364.32 → 1367.12] And then afterwards, we didn't know this part was going to happen.
[1367.42 → 1368.34] They had us take pictures.
[1369.42 → 1371.22] Like, but not for us.
[1371.22 → 1374.54] Like, they had it so like random tourists could come up and take pictures with us.
[1374.60 → 1375.10] No way.
[1375.30 → 1375.46] Yeah.
[1375.60 → 1378.94] Did they take a lot of pictures of like the hulking gigantic white guy?
[1379.38 → 1379.56] Yeah.
[1379.60 → 1381.18] They also took tons of pictures of Diesel.
[1381.66 → 1382.06] Really?
[1382.20 → 1383.14] It wasn't just me.
[1383.88 → 1384.02] Oh.
[1384.84 → 1385.16] Oh.
[1385.90 → 1386.30] Wow.
[1386.40 → 1387.12] That was lucky.
[1390.46 → 1391.56] Are you guys going to shoot?
[1391.88 → 1392.30] There we go.
[1394.50 → 1394.90] Huh.
[1395.32 → 1395.62] Yeah.
[1395.80 → 1396.78] So it wasn't just me.
[1397.10 → 1398.60] Apparently there were people that...
[1398.60 → 1399.36] Don't fire when you're on it.
[1399.36 → 1399.96] Um.
[1400.44 → 1404.16] We're like telling their kids to go take pictures with the white commander.
[1404.82 → 1405.72] Which was pretty funny.
[1405.98 → 1406.46] A commander?
[1406.60 → 1408.04] What makes you a commander exactly?
[1408.12 → 1408.62] Commander of what?
[1408.64 → 1412.22] It's just your role in the changing the guards' ceremony.
[1412.98 → 1413.38] Okay.
[1414.34 → 1416.06] So we were like the main two people.
[1416.56 → 1416.94] Wow.
[1417.02 → 1417.58] That's cool.
[1417.74 → 1418.24] It was actually really cool.
[1418.24 → 1419.84] How do you become the main two people?
[1419.94 → 1421.16] Like doesn't someone else want to do it?
[1421.16 → 1422.66] I...
[1422.66 → 1423.04] I...
[1423.04 → 1423.22] Oh.
[1423.88 → 1424.68] I thought so.
[1425.26 → 1425.78] But...
[1425.78 → 1428.86] It's very public.
[1429.02 → 1431.02] So I think a lot of people are just too shy.
[1431.82 → 1432.18] Really?
[1432.24 → 1434.98] Because you're the main two people in a big thing.
[1434.98 → 1436.58] Why do people come watch this then?
[1437.32 → 1438.68] A lot of them are locals too.
[1439.46 → 1439.86] Really?
[1442.50 → 1444.12] Like locals like from Korea?
[1444.32 → 1445.28] Or locals like from Seoul?
[1445.44 → 1446.20] Locals from...
[1446.20 → 1446.50] Oh.
[1446.98 → 1447.54] I'm not sure.
[1448.20 → 1449.68] Because Korea is like an entire country.
[1449.80 → 1450.12] I know.
[1450.44 → 1453.86] That's like saying everyone at the Calgary Stampede is a local because they're Canadian.
[1453.98 → 1456.10] Yeah, but this is something that happens every single day.
[1456.58 → 1457.20] Every day?
[1457.44 → 1458.08] Every single day.
[1458.28 → 1459.50] And like multiple times a day.
[1460.50 → 1462.06] Just it only happens with...
[1462.06 → 1463.32] Ah, why can't they do this?
[1463.66 → 1465.50] Random participants once a day.
[1465.70 → 1466.32] Oh, I see.
[1466.32 → 1467.66] It happens quite a bit, actually.
[1467.82 → 1468.82] It's like every few hours.
[1469.52 → 1471.16] Because they actually change the guard.
[1471.38 → 1473.36] And those people actually stand there and...
[1473.36 → 1473.64] Right.
[1473.76 → 1474.82] Quote on quote guard the place.
[1474.82 → 1476.28] We've got some Q&A now.
[1477.10 → 1480.46] So Yang asks, how do I play a game on both screens if I have dual monitors?
[1480.72 → 1481.86] The game has to support it.
[1482.14 → 1482.30] Yang?
[1482.82 → 1485.98] So games like Supreme Commander had awesome dual monitor support.
[1486.22 → 1488.74] One of the many things that was fantastic about that game.
[1489.10 → 1490.44] I was pretty sure I had that.
[1492.04 → 1495.24] Many games don't really have the functionalities to support dual monitor.
[1495.24 → 1499.88] For example, Blizzard refuses to enable any kind of dual monitor because it might be a competitive advantage.
[1500.68 → 1501.50] They have a point.
[1502.16 → 1503.50] They do not have a point.
[1503.50 → 1504.76] They don't have a point.
[1504.76 → 1505.08] They have a point.
[1505.34 → 1509.04] That's like the NFL saying, well, you know...
[1509.04 → 1509.72] They do...
[1509.72 → 1512.50] They don't allow certain equipment because of competitive advantage.
[1512.62 → 1514.58] They don't allow gloves that stick way too much.
[1516.24 → 1516.72] Okay.
[1517.22 → 1517.86] But...
[1517.86 → 1518.86] They don't allow drugging.
[1519.66 → 1521.26] We're not talking about drugging.
[1521.50 → 1525.18] We're not talking about Blizzard saying no performance enhancing Ritalin.
[1525.24 → 1527.92] Which as far as I can tell gets used in an awful lot.
[1527.92 → 1527.98] Yeah.
[1529.78 → 1535.46] So if drugs are okay, then I would certainly think another piece of computer equipment is probably okay.
[1535.74 → 1536.98] Oh, I missed that job.
[1537.14 → 1538.32] I think it's ridiculous.
[1538.50 → 1547.32] So on Supreme Commander, you could use your second monitor as a mini-map, or you could actually zoom all the way in on it and use it as a full-fledged secondary map screen.
[1547.52 → 1550.08] So you could be monitoring a couple of bases at the same time.
[1550.08 → 1550.98] It was very, very cool.
[1551.46 → 1557.60] Also, the way that Subcom zoomed in and out was outstanding because you could look at as much or as little of the map as you wanted.
[1558.00 → 1561.30] So you could be more micro-oriented, or you could be more macro-oriented.
[1561.42 → 1562.06] You have the choice.
[1562.50 → 1565.38] Whereas Blizzard says, no, you will play the game this way.
[1565.84 → 1567.04] And this way only.
[1567.54 → 1569.34] And they're not German.
[1569.66 → 1570.94] So that made no sense.
[1571.08 → 1572.34] But I think you still get my point.
[1573.78 → 1575.24] It makes it more competitive?
[1575.90 → 1576.90] In what way?
[1576.90 → 1578.40] It equals the playing field more.
[1578.40 → 1579.64] Okay.
[1580.04 → 1581.20] So should they be allowed to have...
[1581.20 → 1582.78] Fewer options can make things more competitive.
[1583.12 → 1586.52] That's part of the problem WoW Arenas had is there are too many abilities.
[1587.58 → 1588.10] Okay.
[1588.50 → 1592.30] So would it be more competitive if everyone had the same mouse?
[1593.98 → 1594.50] Possibly.
[1595.12 → 1596.64] Would that be ridiculous?
[1597.32 → 1599.92] A lot more ridiculous than allowing people to have multiple monitors.
[1601.80 → 1603.04] I think it's ridiculous.
[1603.74 → 1606.36] I think if the equipment's out there, you should be allowed to use it.
[1606.36 → 1613.08] And it's not like multiple monitors is like space-age technology that is new in some way.
[1613.32 → 1615.04] No, but not very many people will do it.
[1615.04 → 1623.42] Do you think Corsair is going to go back to Coolie or stay with Ace Attack?
[1623.90 → 1626.50] I don't know who they're using for H100i.
[1626.56 → 1627.82] I thought that was a Coolie design.
[1628.82 → 1633.50] Because Corsair Link is based on Coolie's software that never got released.
[1634.34 → 1635.58] Is my understanding.
[1635.84 → 1637.76] Although I could actually be wrong about that.
[1637.76 → 1641.34] But they've used Ace Attack throughout the whole thing.
[1641.42 → 1646.38] I don't think H70 went away for a lot of the life cycle of H80.
[1647.48 → 1649.38] And they still have Ace Attack designs.
[1649.50 → 1651.14] Like H110 and H90.
[1651.30 → 1652.26] They're two newest coolers.
[1652.34 → 1653.46] They're both Ace Attack coolers.
[1654.04 → 1658.74] So they're exactly the same coolers as the Kraken X40 and Kraken X60 from NZXT.
[1659.54 → 1660.40] Cool thing.
[1660.68 → 1663.08] I don't know if you guys had seen this in our Computer coverage.
[1663.22 → 1665.24] I don't know if you saw this, Slick.
[1665.86 → 1667.60] But NZ...
[1667.60 → 1669.18] Why do I keep doing that?
[1669.82 → 1673.30] NZXT has a really cool product coming.
[1673.56 → 1676.96] That is going to be a GPU water block.
[1677.32 → 1678.00] Is that the same thing?
[1678.26 → 1681.90] That is not really a water block.
[1682.00 → 1683.20] So it mounts like a fan.
[1683.60 → 1687.62] And then it's like a hold down for an Ace Attack standard cooler thing.
[1687.62 → 1688.26] Oh.
[1688.82 → 1689.42] So you can...
[1689.42 → 1692.74] Because a lot of people have been ghetto mounting those to their GPUs for a while.
[1692.90 → 1693.84] They're going to make it official.
[1694.36 → 1695.92] And they're advertising right there.
[1696.00 → 1697.54] Like it'll work with any Ace Attack cooler.
[1697.64 → 1701.14] Whether it's an NZXT one or a Corsair one or whatever else the case may be.
[1701.62 → 1702.28] That's pretty cool.
[1702.34 → 1703.26] I think that's really cool.
[1703.40 → 1703.56] Yeah.
[1704.78 → 1705.90] NZXT, like...
[1705.90 → 1708.04] They just do some cool stuff sometimes.
[1709.18 → 1711.46] Like they have a fan hub that we haven't unboxed yet.
[1711.52 → 1712.38] But it's sitting downstairs.
[1712.66 → 1713.62] That's just...
[1713.62 → 1716.02] It's just like it's so simple.
[1716.30 → 1717.22] Like this is...
[1717.22 → 1717.44] Yeah.
[1717.62 → 1717.90] Good.
[1718.12 → 1719.18] Good work, guys.
[1719.62 → 1720.54] Make more stuff like this.
[1720.58 → 1722.08] Like their USB...
[1722.08 → 1724.62] Their internal USB port splitter.
[1725.10 → 1726.30] Was really cool.
[1726.38 → 1728.56] It didn't work on quite a few motherboards.
[1728.68 → 1728.78] Yeah.
[1729.26 → 1731.34] And I think that's why it eventually got discontinued.
[1731.42 → 1733.64] It was like the IU-01 or something like that.
[1734.42 → 1735.10] And...
[1735.10 → 1738.94] I think we're actually getting worse.
[1739.16 → 1739.56] Yeah.
[1740.42 → 1741.84] We almost beat it that one time.
[1741.90 → 1743.92] They got disheartened by being killed on top of Joshi.
[1744.02 → 1744.92] And now we just suck.
[1744.92 → 1750.52] How much will running a PCI Express 3.0 card on a 2.0 motherboard affect performance?
[1750.64 → 1751.12] Not at all.
[1751.76 → 1752.94] You missed it on the mainstream.
[1753.18 → 1755.62] 4770 K at 7 gigahertz.
[1756.00 → 1756.26] Okay.
[1756.44 → 1756.66] Cool.
[1756.66 → 1762.34] We saw pretty close to that at the Corsair OC main event at Computer.
[1762.70 → 1764.18] So it doesn't really surprise me.
[1764.82 → 1768.22] With all of that said, I mean, I've always been sort of...
[1768.22 → 1776.10] I've always sort of been interested in the whole professional overclocking thing.
[1776.78 → 1778.74] Purely from an academic standpoint.
[1779.00 → 1779.22] Yeah.
[1780.12 → 1780.94] I am...
[1780.94 → 1783.32] Like I look at it, and I'm like, yeah, this is moderately interesting.
[1783.66 → 1785.14] Not actually realistic though.
[1785.40 → 1787.82] But it's always been about 24-7 for me.
[1788.18 → 1791.82] How can I run my computer with this chip at this frequency?
[1791.82 → 1796.38] And if the answer is, well, you can't, then I'm like, okay, cool.
[1797.00 → 1797.94] So later.
[1799.04 → 1803.62] One thing I said while we were there, and like I've been at overclocking events before
[1803.62 → 1806.18] and I've thought this before, just something I said while we were there,
[1806.62 → 1812.88] was it would be interesting to see this exact same thing, but put everyone on like H100Is.
[1814.20 → 1814.64] Right.
[1815.60 → 1816.36] Oh my goodness.
[1816.36 → 1824.42] And part of the problem with pro overclocking as well is that so much of it is dependent on luck of the draw.
[1825.08 → 1827.80] Like the way that it works at the way that it worked at the MOA,
[1828.02 → 1831.66] which was MSI's overclocking event at CES 2011,
[1832.96 → 1839.88] was everyone got by random lottery a CPU, a motherboard, a graphics card.
[1840.72 → 1845.76] And I'm just like, okay, so someone got a better CPU than everyone else.
[1846.36 → 1852.16] And because they're all very, very skilled, if one person gets a better CPU, then that's it.
[1852.16 → 1852.72] They probably win.
[1852.74 → 1853.10] Game over.
[1853.34 → 1853.48] Yeah.
[1854.14 → 1856.16] But there's no way to level the playing field.
[1856.28 → 1859.20] That's the problem with pro overclocking is you,
[1859.38 → 1863.74] it's not like you can bin processors that are equally crappy or something.
[1863.94 → 1864.06] Yeah.
[1864.40 → 1867.62] There will always be someone with an advantage no matter what you do.
[1867.72 → 1869.60] And it's just like, well, what kind of sport is that?
[1869.60 → 1873.02] I mean, this is the opposite of what we're talking about with Star Craft,
[1873.14 → 1878.82] where Blizzard's like, no, nobody will have any advantage regardless of whatever else is going on.
[1879.58 → 1883.16] Whereas this is like someone will always have an advantage.
[1883.16 → 1883.26] Really?
[1885.18 → 1886.22] That was lucky.
[1888.12 → 1889.38] Whatever, you're still moving.
[1890.58 → 1891.60] Still counts.
[1891.60 → 1897.36] And then at the OC main event for Corsair,
[1897.62 → 1899.46] they had the open category as well,
[1899.54 → 1901.06] where people were allowed to bring their own gear.
[1901.40 → 1903.76] So you look at guys like Andre Yang,
[1903.94 → 1905.16] who works with ASUS,
[1905.52 → 1906.66] so as you can imagine,
[1906.82 → 1910.70] has access to some pretty cool hardcore stuff
[1910.70 → 1911.94] that no one else there,
[1912.40 → 1914.50] even the really like sponsored guys,
[1914.98 → 1915.92] was able to get.
[1916.44 → 1917.38] He cleaned up.
[1917.46 → 1920.66] He won all eight of the events that weren't the random lottery ones.
[1920.66 → 1922.70] He didn't even go for the random lottery ones
[1922.70 → 1925.22] because he knew it was just going to be random anyway.
[1925.70 → 1928.24] Whoever wins will be the one who got the best thing,
[1928.34 → 1930.24] and there you go.
[1930.44 → 1931.42] That's all there is to it, right?
[1933.86 → 1936.80] So that's the frustrating thing to me about pro overclocking.
[1937.38 → 1937.72] Let's see.
[1937.92 → 1938.66] Do we have another...
[1938.66 → 1939.08] Keep rolling.
[1939.24 → 1939.82] You might make this.
[1940.72 → 1941.78] You want to get past this level.
[1942.16 → 1943.60] Yeah, I'm kind of tired of playing this level.
[1943.94 → 1945.26] I'm surprised we have...
[1945.26 → 1947.54] I'm surprised we have six more,
[1947.64 → 1949.48] or like four more things to go.
[1950.66 → 1951.80] I thought it was less than...
[1951.80 → 1952.70] Oh...
[1952.70 → 1962.32] There we go.
[1962.48 → 1962.64] Yes.
[1964.14 → 1964.66] Oof.
[1965.44 → 1966.64] Mad skills, son.
[1966.84 → 1967.06] Yay!
[1967.66 → 1968.36] It's over.
[1969.38 → 1969.96] Finally.
[1969.96 → 1969.98] Okay.
[1969.98 → 1970.10] Okay.
[1971.82 → 1972.48] Someone says,
[1972.62 → 1974.48] what happened inside the tower in Taiwan
[1974.48 → 1975.42] when there was an earthquake?
[1975.56 → 1976.58] Did anyone panic at all?
[1976.96 → 1978.10] Yes, they did.
[1978.10 → 1979.64] The staff mainly.
[1979.84 → 1980.46] The staff.
[1980.88 → 1982.46] The staff were like,
[1982.86 → 1985.64] not super impressed about an earthquake.
[1986.64 → 1989.76] I think I already said this during the...
[1989.76 → 1991.22] Whatever it's called.
[1991.32 → 1991.78] Go, move.
[1992.20 → 1996.16] I think I already said this during one of the travel blogs,
[1996.86 → 1998.04] but one of the staff,
[1998.10 → 1998.40] I was like,
[1998.44 → 1999.00] is this normal?
[1999.00 → 1999.96] And she's just like,
[1999.98 → 2001.72] her face is like completely pale.
[2003.52 → 2003.84] Whoa.
[2003.94 → 2006.00] And she's just like...
[2006.00 → 2007.64] Yeah, no.
[2008.38 → 2010.28] No, no, no, it's not.
[2010.40 → 2011.56] No, actually it isn't.
[2014.46 → 2017.12] So that was kind of crazy.
[2017.68 → 2020.60] And the WD staffers that we were with
[2020.60 → 2023.08] were not super impressed about the whole thing.
[2023.08 → 2025.54] And then the fact that they shut down the stairs.
[2026.60 → 2028.18] That was pretty weird to me.
[2028.80 → 2030.32] Did you hear the explanation?
[2030.54 → 2030.98] No, I didn't.
[2031.00 → 2031.70] Which does make sense.
[2032.04 → 2033.40] They were worried about trampling.
[2034.38 → 2034.70] Okay.
[2034.80 → 2036.28] Because the stairs are so long,
[2037.38 → 2039.48] the possibility of trampling is very high.
[2040.10 → 2041.22] Which does make sense,
[2041.30 → 2042.88] because a lot of times in this kind of situations,
[2043.38 → 2044.84] what ends up killing a lot of people
[2044.84 → 2046.02] is actually getting trampled.
[2047.10 → 2048.54] How the heck am I supposed to get that?
[2048.54 → 2049.20] That jump off someone?
[2049.42 → 2050.54] Oh, it's this yellow guy.
[2051.34 → 2051.82] Come on.
[2053.08 → 2054.54] Oh, I thought they...
[2054.54 → 2056.82] That's weird.
[2057.52 → 2057.84] Ah!
[2058.78 → 2059.30] Good job.
[2060.50 → 2060.76] Hmm.
[2061.26 → 2062.86] I actually don't know how to get up there.
[2063.40 → 2064.92] Unless it was the jumping guy
[2064.92 → 2066.40] and I screwed it up somehow.
[2066.84 → 2069.30] No, these guys are supposed to...
[2069.30 → 2071.02] There's like a logic for when they jump.
[2071.48 → 2072.38] I don't know what it is.
[2073.74 → 2074.36] Come on.
[2075.06 → 2075.46] Can you just...
[2075.46 → 2077.04] Oh, wow, there's not a lot of time for this level.
[2077.14 → 2077.66] Holy crap.
[2080.80 → 2081.20] Okay.
[2081.48 → 2082.22] Well, here we go.
[2083.08 → 2087.00] I have no idea what this is for.
[2087.50 → 2088.04] Guess we'll guess.
[2088.10 → 2089.46] I usually just take them with me.
[2093.86 → 2094.26] Meh!
[2097.26 → 2097.50] Meh!
[2100.42 → 2102.16] Oh, no, I don't think you can jump on these guys.
[2102.30 → 2102.54] Uh-oh.
[2103.32 → 2103.82] Okay, now what?
[2103.98 → 2104.94] Spin on that plus.
[2105.22 → 2105.84] Oh, there they are.
[2105.84 → 2111.20] And finally, the spin jump is the solution that is needed.
[2111.44 → 2112.40] Always the solution.
[2112.60 → 2112.82] No.
[2113.70 → 2114.80] Mind you, that speed runner...
[2114.80 → 2115.80] He always does it.
[2115.86 → 2119.86] ...it's like always spin jumps in spite of its obvious inferiority.
[2120.02 → 2121.94] Apparently not, because he's the fastest one in the world.
[2123.24 → 2123.94] I hope I missed that.
[2123.98 → 2124.90] I don't have a lot of time, though.
[2125.78 → 2126.78] How much time do I have?
[2126.78 → 2127.78] 44.
[2127.78 → 2128.78] I...
[2128.78 → 2133.32] Judging by how little time they give you, though, you might be near the end.
[2133.32 → 2134.32] Oh, no.
[2134.32 → 2135.32] Oh.
[2135.32 → 2136.32] Oh.
[2136.32 → 2137.32] Oh.
[2137.32 → 2138.32] Oh.
[2138.32 → 2139.32] Oh.
[2139.32 → 2140.32] Oh.
[2140.32 → 2141.32] Oh.
[2141.32 → 2142.32] Oh.
[2142.32 → 2143.32] Oh.
[2143.32 → 2144.32] Very nice.
[2144.32 → 2145.32] 20?
[2145.32 → 2146.32] K.
[2146.32 → 2147.32] Keep rolling.
[2147.32 → 2148.32] Go, go, go.
[2148.32 → 2149.32] No time to wait.
[2149.32 → 2150.32] Jump, jump, jump.
[2150.32 → 2151.32] You are...
[2151.32 → 2152.32] You are...
[2152.32 → 2153.32] Almost out of time, dead!
[2153.32 → 2154.32] No, you must be kidding me.
[2154.32 → 2155.32] I'm dead!
[2155.32 → 2156.32] No!
[2156.32 → 2157.32] Come on!
[2157.32 → 2158.32] After how many, like, hardcore moves I pulled out in that one?
[2158.32 → 2159.32] There were quite a few epic things that happened there.
[2159.32 → 2160.32] Oh.
[2160.32 → 2161.32] Man.
[2161.32 → 2162.32] That was...
[2162.32 → 2163.32] terrible!
[2163.32 → 2164.32] Oh crap.
[2164.32 → 2165.32] Oh crap.
[2165.32 → 2166.32] Oh crap.
[2166.32 → 2167.32] Oh crap.
[2167.32 → 2168.32] Oh crap.
[2168.32 → 2169.32] That was terrible.
[2169.32 → 2170.32] Oh crap.
[2170.32 → 2171.32] That was terrible!
[2171.32 → 2174.32] Don't bother, just go!
[2174.32 → 2178.32] There's not a lot of time-they only give you 200 of whatever that unit of time they're
[2178.32 → 2189.08] That was terrible! That was terrible! Don't bother, just go! There's not a lot of time,
[2189.08 → 2194.12] they only give you 200 of whatever that unit of time that they're talking about is.
[2194.12 → 2208.12] Oh, I need a mushroom. Is there one here? Oh yeah, there is, too.
[2208.12 → 2218.28] You can't let those guys slow you down. Nope. Good luck. This level is actually pretty
[2218.28 → 2223.04] hard. I kind of lucked out a few times there, as you may or may not have noticed. Like, landing
[2223.04 → 2229.62] on that purple square that one time, that was not intentional. Oh, crap. I was really hoping
[2229.62 → 2235.18] that was a mushroom. And like, walking under some of those charging chucks was not intentional.
[2235.18 → 2242.18] That was nuts! I wasn't sure if it was or not, but I was like, okay. That's pretty cool.
[2242.18 → 2249.72] One of them was on purpose, but then the other one wasn't. This one was on purpose. The other
[2249.72 → 2255.36] one was not on purpose at all. I don't think I even stopped for that mushroom, either. Just
[2255.36 → 2262.36] had no time at all. Uh oh, now they're going to chase you. Okay, you got it. You are a super...
[2262.36 → 2270.36] See, they troll you so hard. Short time limit and then like this long... This super long ending
[2270.36 → 2280.36] thing. That's brutal. Someone says, our next-gen express slots just for multiple card configs, then.
[2280.36 → 2291.36] Um... Next-gen... No. Because it doesn't really make any difference. Um... Because, like, two
[2291.36 → 2302.36] PCIe... Ugh! I mean, okay. So two PCIe 2.0 8x slots is about equivalent to two PCIe 1x 16x slots,
[2302.36 → 2312.36] which is equivalent to two PCIe Gen 3 4x slots. Um... And really, PCIe 1x 16x is about all we
[2312.36 → 2321.36] really need, except for the very, very extreme level cards. Um... Oh yeah, it's over here.
[2321.36 → 2325.36] We should find more levels to play, because for some reason... I was saying, what are we
[2325.36 → 2329.36] missing? Yeah. I don't actually know. You know what? Why don't we do a quick reset? We
[2329.36 → 2334.36] just saved right now, right? Mm-hmm. So if we reset... Oh wait, we didn't save state. Let's
[2334.36 → 2342.36] save state just in case. Okay. And then let's go find out, like, how much is left. Reset.
[2342.36 → 2349.36] Yes. So there we go. That should... That should do it. Because I think we still have a few
[2349.36 → 2353.36] things left. Mm-hmm. 92. We still have four exits to find. Four
[2353.36 → 2356.36] things left. Okay, let's go back, because we definitely
[2356.36 → 2362.36] haven't beaten Bowser's Castle yet. Oh no, we should just load state. Right. Yay, save states.
[2362.36 → 2369.36] And it's my turn again. Um... That's bizarre. I don't... I don't know, man. You know this game
[2369.36 → 2372.36] a lot better than me. I don't know where it's supposed to go. Okay, well let's go back to the
[2372.36 → 2381.36] Valley Bowser for one thing. Sure. Yeah. I think that's the bottom right, right? Sure. That makes sense.
[2381.36 → 2388.36] So I got my bike done today. Yep. Did I tell you what the damage was? Like, just under 400, I think?
[2388.36 → 2395.36] Yeah, 365. So between that and my car, I've spent over a thousand dollars repairing vehicles in the last week.
[2395.36 → 2400.36] Like, a thousand dollars. What did you do on your car? I didn't know you did anything on your car.
[2400.36 → 2412.36] Uh, yeah. No, my car needed a new clutch. Yeah. Super Civic. Like, not happy with its life. So, yeah. I'm, uh...
[2412.36 → 2418.36] Is this a level we needed? Not real happy. This is one exit. This is the back door exit.
[2418.36 → 2429.36] Um... And then my bike needed a new battery. It's funny, the shop told me you're lucky to get a year out of a bike battery, but that doesn't seem right to me.
[2429.36 → 2434.36] That's... What? Really? Yeah, he's like, yeah, if you get more than a season out of it, then you're doing pretty well.
[2434.36 → 2440.36] Seems weird. Um...
[2440.36 → 2447.36] And then, uh, for the... So for the bike, I needed a new battery oil to... He... The speed runner did this without touching the ground.
[2447.36 → 2449.36] I know, that's insane. What the heck?
[2449.36 → 2453.36] I actually haven't watched it, I just watched the comments, so I don't know how he did it.
[2453.36 → 2456.36] He had a cape. And he just... Kept going.
[2456.36 → 2461.36] That's ridiculous. I didn't know that you could perpetually keep air in a cape, but apparently you can.
[2461.36 → 2465.36] Huh. Like, I mean, I can handle Bowser here, but, like...
[2465.36 → 2470.36] Oh, right, I forgot he doesn't, uh, he doesn't follow you in this part.
[2470.36 → 2473.36] But I can't do it without touching the ground, that's for sure.
[2473.36 → 2474.36] Mm-hmm.
[2477.36 → 2482.36] Why do all the Koo pas sound like cats?
[2482.36 → 2484.36] What just happened?
[2486.36 → 2489.36] Our CRT... Oh! Our CRT just trolled us there.
[2489.36 → 2491.36] That was not cool.
[2491.36 → 2496.36] Okay, so you go over there. Oh, that's not very far away from me.
[2496.36 → 2498.36] Wheeeeeeee!
[2498.36 → 2499.36] Rrrrraa-RA-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.
[2499.36 → 2501.36] Help! Ah! Ah!
[2501.36 → 2506.36] I have all these mushrooms in here, and yet I somehow need your help! Ah!
[2506.36 → 2509.36] Guess I can't just power up and do things myself!
[2509.36 → 2512.36] Hey, we never figured out if we were going to be able to stream any modern games.
[2512.36 → 2513.16] many modern games.
[2514.24 → 2516.08] We should be able to find some good games.
[2516.08 → 2517.24] Figure something out kind of thing, right?
[2517.40 → 2517.60] Yeah.
[2518.40 → 2519.12] I mean...
[2519.12 → 2520.50] Okay.
[2520.58 → 2523.08] We could do a viewer stream with Star Craft pretty easily, I think.
[2523.68 → 2523.96] Ah.
[2524.24 → 2527.76] If I tried to play Star Craft, we'd have to find the viewers that are best at Star Craft,
[2527.84 → 2529.00] and I'd get all of them on my team.
[2530.00 → 2531.28] I'm not particularly good.
[2531.38 → 2534.36] I have one strategy that I like doing because I find it fun, not because it's good.
[2534.50 → 2535.20] I know it's not good.
[2535.42 → 2537.68] I can play other starts and do better.
[2538.10 → 2540.26] I just choose not to because I like mine more.
[2542.36 → 2544.20] I like my fail strategy.
[2544.52 → 2546.96] It's fun, and it makes for interesting games.
[2547.08 → 2547.72] Is that just carriers?
[2548.00 → 2548.40] Yeah, man.
[2549.30 → 2549.92] I love carriers.
[2550.88 → 2552.88] You just carry your fanboy hard, and then that's it.
[2552.88 → 2553.44] They're awesome.
[2554.40 → 2555.16] They're so cool.
[2555.30 → 2555.90] So underrated.
[2556.64 → 2557.54] So underrated?
[2557.70 → 2559.22] If anything, carriers are overrated.
[2559.38 → 2560.18] No, not now.
[2560.26 → 2560.96] Well, they used to be.
[2561.14 → 2562.08] Yeah, not now.
[2563.22 → 2564.66] It's like, yay, Protons.
[2564.72 → 2565.90] Okay, when will they go carriers?
[2566.94 → 2567.62] Not now.
[2567.78 → 2568.18] Not at all.
[2572.36 → 2576.34] You won't get this at all, but for anyone who's watching who possibly watched the Star Craft Finals,
[2576.94 → 2580.56] in that game, if SOS went carriers instead of freaking Tempest,
[2581.52 → 2582.14] you could have won.
[2583.14 → 2584.42] I'm telling you right now, you could have won.
[2584.48 → 2586.78] How often do you watch, like, gaming finals?
[2586.94 → 2587.64] Not super awesome.
[2587.84 → 2589.04] I don't, not super awesome.
[2589.46 → 2590.38] Not super often.
[2590.54 → 2591.32] I don't really have the time.
[2591.40 → 2592.24] But you were there live.
[2592.52 → 2593.26] I was there live.
[2593.44 → 2594.00] Yeah, that was great.
[2594.76 → 2595.26] Very, very good.
[2595.26 → 2597.94] So you might as well watch it if you're going to be all the way in Korea.
[2598.34 → 2598.58] Yeah.
[2598.90 → 2599.06] Yeah.
[2600.56 → 2601.88] I watch my brother's stuff.
[2602.48 → 2602.78] Right.
[2603.44 → 2603.60] Yeah.
[2604.26 → 2607.22] And I'll watch, like, Day 9 does Fun Day Monday stuff.
[2607.86 → 2608.38] Which is, like...
[2608.38 → 2608.50] Oh, crap.
[2608.54 → 2609.14] I forgot about that.
[2609.24 → 2610.44] Oh, and the screen's off.
[2611.54 → 2612.16] Watch there.
[2612.58 → 2614.36] Yeah, that's pretty laggy.
[2614.36 → 2615.36] Ha, ha!
[2618.36 → 2618.84] Oops.
[2620.54 → 2621.22] Book, book, book, book, book, book, book.
[2621.22 → 2623.68] I'll keep randomly touching the touchpad so it doesn't do that.
[2623.86 → 2625.08] Yeah, that's kind of annoying.
[2625.26 → 2626.18] It wasn't doing that.
[2626.74 → 2627.76] Oh, that's not what I meant.
[2627.82 → 2630.66] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[2631.88 → 2634.62] I don't think he throws bowling balls this time, though, does he?
[2635.22 → 2635.70] Not sure.
[2637.08 → 2637.48] Book.
[2639.54 → 2640.06] Uh-oh.
[2640.48 → 2641.32] That's not good.
[2642.06 → 2642.40] Don't worry.
[2642.44 → 2642.86] I got this.
[2642.90 → 2643.30] I got this.
[2643.36 → 2643.72] I got this.
[2643.76 → 2644.16] I got this.
[2644.42 → 2644.70] Book.
[2645.02 → 2645.56] And he's done.
[2647.32 → 2651.06] So I think we still have to do the main exit, and then I don't know which other two are missing.
[2651.76 → 2653.08] Let's see if there's any more Q&A.
[2653.08 → 2658.88] Looking for a quality gaming monitor, would you recommend 3D or 2560 by 1440 in your opinion?
[2659.70 → 2661.40] It's not easy to preview one in my city.
[2661.68 → 2665.14] In my opinion, and wow, Princess is hardcore cheating on Mario.
[2665.70 → 2666.18] Um.
[2666.18 → 2670.36] In my opinion, I prefer high-res versus 3D.
[2671.42 → 2675.32] Someone says, doing my homework while watching the after party, it's nearly 12 o'clock at night here.
[2675.90 → 2676.22] Let's see.
[2676.30 → 2676.82] Where is...
[2676.82 → 2678.28] Oh, so Mark's on the East Coast.
[2679.74 → 2681.62] Your thoughts on CPU degrading.
[2681.62 → 2683.16] I've actually had it happen to me.
[2683.24 → 2689.44] My Option 165 overclocked to a certain extent, and then it stopped doing that, and then it died.
[2691.12 → 2693.24] So CPU degrading is very much a thing.
[2693.42 → 2696.36] More voltage and more heat will kill your CPU over time.
[2696.42 → 2704.12] In fact, I think my E6600, the one that I used to run Sub-Zero 24-7, um, did degrade as well.
[2704.24 → 2705.00] Oh, that's surprising.
[2705.00 → 2708.96] Well, it's not, not surprising.
[2711.36 → 2712.76] I wonder if Twitch chat's up.
[2715.30 → 2715.82] Nope.
[2716.16 → 2716.72] Apparently not.
[2717.86 → 2719.00] Oh, are we really going to have...
[2719.00 → 2719.66] Oh, really?
[2721.98 → 2723.22] That's probably so annoying.
[2723.54 → 2724.24] Yeah, I know, right?
[2725.34 → 2726.14] Thank you.
[2728.06 → 2729.02] Oh, man.
[2729.72 → 2730.14] Go.
[2731.64 → 2733.14] Oh, does it just stay here?
[2733.14 → 2735.74] What are you supposed to do?
[2739.38 → 2741.56] Like, in an emulator, to go play more.
[2743.16 → 2748.22] If I reset the console now, I think that should work, right?
[2749.20 → 2750.40] I have no idea.
[2751.14 → 2751.98] Let's find out.
[2752.94 → 2753.66] I'll do it again.
[2754.02 → 2754.40] Okay, go.
[2756.00 → 2756.48] No.
[2757.92 → 2758.38] Oh.
[2759.42 → 2759.86] Okay.
[2759.86 → 2761.86] So let's just...
[2762.66 → 2764.60] Not officially do it.
[2764.80 → 2765.70] Just technically do it.
[2765.88 → 2767.06] So we have the back door now.
[2767.38 → 2768.86] Okay, but I don't know if it counts, then.
[2769.52 → 2771.42] Because there's a way to have a 96 game.
[2772.22 → 2773.88] Yeah, but what I mean is, like...
[2773.88 → 2775.46] Okay, so let's find the...
[2775.46 → 2776.84] What exits are we missing, then?
[2777.00 → 2777.60] No idea.
[2780.60 → 2781.88] No idea at all.
[2782.88 → 2783.28] Huh.
[2788.72 → 2791.48] So, uh, we did a tour of Slick's tech room already.
[2791.98 → 2795.58] And we're going to be doing a tour of the editing room soon.
[2796.08 → 2798.54] Which I think people might find kind of interesting.
[2799.60 → 2800.62] Wait, go back, go back.
[2801.18 → 2801.82] Oh, no, never mind.
[2801.98 → 2803.16] Nope, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[2803.24 → 2803.62] Don't go back.
[2804.52 → 2807.04] So, yeah, we're going to be doing a tour of the editing room soon.
[2807.12 → 2809.38] So we're completely moved into our new HQ.
[2809.98 → 2811.92] There's nothing left at my house.
[2812.16 → 2812.86] We're not settled.
[2813.38 → 2814.30] Yeah, not settled.
[2814.40 → 2815.48] But moved in, yes.
[2815.68 → 2816.20] Settled, no.
[2818.40 → 2821.22] If anyone sees any exits that we're missing along the way here...
[2821.22 → 2822.92] I'm just looking, so...
[2822.92 → 2823.90] Do let us know.
[2824.04 → 2824.36] Yeah.
[2825.02 → 2826.86] Because I'm seeing branches...
[2826.86 → 2829.80] As far as I know, that's complete for Forest of Illusion.
[2830.30 → 2830.64] Yeah.
[2830.64 → 2835.58] Um, we still have to get a green screen, just so that we can do more green screen stuff.
[2835.86 → 2839.70] I think we're going to move to doing fast as possible in front of a green screen.
[2839.80 → 2842.56] It really doesn't help that we've had problems with our white...
[2842.56 → 2843.88] With our white box.
[2844.70 → 2847.38] Problems like cats, like, destroying it.
[2847.56 → 2848.80] And problems like...
[2848.80 → 2852.28] Where did that huge mark on it that everyone was complaining about come from?
[2852.46 → 2852.98] No idea.
[2853.22 → 2853.94] I don't know.
[2854.32 → 2855.50] Nobody seems to know.
[2855.70 → 2858.06] Everyone denies having anything to do with it.
[2858.72 → 2859.28] So...
[2859.28 → 2860.34] Does this have a secret exit?
[2860.34 → 2861.14] Uh, yeah.
[2861.50 → 2862.52] It's been found over.
[2862.58 → 2863.80] Oh, that ghost house.
[2865.76 → 2866.28] I...
[2866.28 → 2867.24] Don't know.
[2867.62 → 2869.74] I don't know where it would possibly go.
[2869.88 → 2871.62] Are we missing ghost house secret exits?
[2875.64 → 2876.48] Someone says...
[2876.48 → 2877.44] No, man, I'm in Asia.
[2877.68 → 2877.88] Oh.
[2878.80 → 2879.32] All right, then.
[2879.32 → 2882.62] Well, okay, then.
[2882.68 → 2888.28] Well, Asia's sort of similar to East Coast North America in that they both are on Earth.
[2888.70 → 2889.14] So...
[2889.14 → 2889.92] Oh, nice.
[2890.12 → 2890.60] Um...
[2890.60 → 2892.32] I don't know, man.
[2892.32 → 2894.10] Slick is still using the Z10.
[2894.52 → 2896.62] Yes, he wants to go back to Android soon.
[2898.02 → 2898.42] And...
[2898.42 → 2903.46] Apparently, we are just Mario noobs because you just walked through the whole place.
[2903.46 → 2905.76] And I don't see any more exits.
[2907.76 → 2910.42] So, I guess it's time to go home.
[2910.88 → 2912.42] Because I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.
[2912.52 → 2913.48] It's actually been a long week.
[2913.96 → 2915.26] This week...
[2915.26 → 2915.86] Oh, yeah.
[2916.16 → 2916.36] In...
[2916.36 → 2919.38] Or this weekend, in the new HQ, I get to build a kitchen.
[2919.72 → 2921.08] Which I've never done before.
[2921.40 → 2927.56] So, I get to build all the cabinets and go buy a countertop and tile it and put laminate
[2927.56 → 2928.32] down in the floor.
[2929.02 → 2930.10] So, that'll be fun.
[2930.46 → 2931.54] And you have a rip-up carpet.
[2931.70 → 2932.56] I get to rip-up carpet.
[2932.58 → 2933.46] Like, nice carpet.
[2934.10 → 2935.08] Yeah, I know.
[2936.52 → 2938.02] But who carpets a kitchen?
[2938.22 → 2938.84] Yeah, I know, I know.
[2938.92 → 2939.60] That's disgusting.
[2939.62 → 2940.12] That'd be gross.
[2940.42 → 2940.66] Yeah.
[2940.86 → 2942.10] That would be so Brody.
[2942.10 → 2944.42] I mean, even if the tenant's not going to be using it much.
[2944.42 → 2946.22] It'd still be really gross.
[2946.24 → 2946.82] It would be disgusting.
[2946.84 → 2948.56] Because it'll still be used to some amount.
[2948.68 → 2948.82] Yeah.
[2948.92 → 2950.00] And stuff will splash.
[2950.26 → 2950.94] Stuff will spill.
[2951.44 → 2954.42] Like, it'll end up mouldy and gross and horrible.
[2955.52 → 2957.56] And, uh...
[2957.56 → 2959.84] Someone asked, what's with the palette swap on the world map?
[2959.96 → 2961.44] That's after beating the special levels.
[2961.68 → 2961.86] Yeah.
[2962.50 → 2963.32] But, yeah.
[2963.46 → 2965.20] So, I get to do that this weekend.
[2965.38 → 2971.54] I get to go shopping at Ikea for more, like, random crap for the sets and all that.
[2971.54 → 2972.54] And, uh...
[2972.54 → 2977.22] Oh, before we go, I get to go get that Fast as Possible episode that we filmed this morning
[2977.22 → 2978.54] and take it to B-Roll's house.
[2978.98 → 2981.48] Because he forgot to edit it, apparently, while he was here.
[2982.90 → 2983.46] Um...
[2983.46 → 2985.50] So, that's awesome.
[2985.98 → 2987.78] I don't even know where all the footage is.
[2988.32 → 2988.54] Someone asked...
[2988.54 → 2991.26] I have an awesome tech room that had a lot of room.
[2991.54 → 2992.78] And now it doesn't.
[2992.78 → 2993.78] Yeah.
[2994.02 → 2995.94] Now that we have our stream set up in it.
[2996.26 → 3000.12] So, we're actually in Slick's tech room with a couch here and a coffee table.
[3000.60 → 3004.40] And then, right on the other side of the camera is the test bench.
[3004.56 → 3006.46] And then on this side of the camera is more test benches.
[3006.56 → 3008.72] And on that side of the camera is what Little's left of storage.
[3010.98 → 3011.84] It's like nothing.
[3011.96 → 3013.34] Bye-bye, my spacious room.
[3013.34 → 3014.06] Um...
[3014.06 → 3014.34] Uh...
[3014.34 → 3017.44] HQ Tour will come in bits and pieces over the next little while.
[3017.66 → 3021.30] I'm going to sneak it in with other content that I need you guys to watch.
[3023.02 → 3023.10] So...
[3023.10 → 3024.80] That's my...
[3024.80 → 3026.14] That's my dastardly plan.
[3027.84 → 3028.56] Um...
[3028.56 → 3028.84] Alright!
[3029.10 → 3029.76] Goodnight, everyone!
[3030.20 → 3031.30] Alright, thanks for watching.
[3031.56 → 3032.12] See you next...
