[0.00 --> 7.80]  And we're live guys! So we're a little bit sort of disheveled or disorganized or
[7.80 --> 11.82]  whatever you're used to seeing this. Is this your grape juice? Okay don't bother
[11.82 --> 15.68]  doing anything with that light because I think the lighting is fine. No, it's okay.
[15.68 --> 21.00]  No, they can't see it. So we have a very special show tonight. We got back from CES,
[21.00 --> 28.02]  was it a week ago already? Yeah, yeah. Okay well I spent the next two days throwing up
[28.02 --> 33.90]  and in bed and everyone gets sick at CES. It's a whole lot of like sort of
[33.90 --> 38.40]  breathing on each other and like handshaking and people from just
[38.40 --> 43.02]  absolutely everywhere. Yeah people from absolutely everywhere. So you're exposed to stuff that your body's not used to.
[43.02 --> 49.44]  That your body hates you for basically. So Slick's gonna check the Twitch chat and
[49.44 --> 53.02]  make sure nothing's wrong. We have a particularly ghetto camera set up tonight
[53.02 --> 58.90]  which is awesome. We had a pretty exciting day filming NCIX Tech Tips today.
[58.90 --> 63.34]  In case you guys are wondering why we're always like super tired and none of our
[63.34 --> 69.40]  equipment is set up, it's because on Fridays we actually film NCIX Tech Tips all day.
[69.40 --> 69.90]  So all of our...
[69.90 --> 70.90]  Any audio problems?
[70.90 --> 71.40]  Audio problems.
[71.40 --> 73.90]  What? We just tested it.
[73.90 --> 74.90]  Popping.
[74.90 --> 84.10]  Popping. So the audio popping, which is my favorite thing ever, has to do with something about
[84.10 --> 90.50]  X-rayed, even though the program did not update at all and did not change at all.
[90.50 --> 98.90]  Or something to do with our cameras which did not change at all and are exactly the same popping that we've been seeing.
[98.90 --> 103.78]  Yep. So basically we have no idea.
[103.78 --> 105.78]  Now we're saying it's fixed.
[105.78 --> 112.78]  No idea at all. We don't know what causes it. We don't know what fixes it because when I sat down with both cameras,
[112.78 --> 126.10]  FS700, XA10, I sat down and I tried every freaking scenario I could come up with and every different cable I could swap and both cameras and everything that I could do.
[126.10 --> 136.98]  I couldn't replicate the issue for the life of me this one time and then this other time it happened and I tried to upload a video of a Meonyx Neos 8200
[137.86 --> 140.58]  three times, all three of which...
[140.58 --> 143.62]  Now I'm getting a call from these old people.
[143.62 --> 144.98]  Yes, sir.
[144.98 --> 148.98]  No.
[148.98 --> 153.70]  We know there's popping. I'm talking about it right now.
[153.70 --> 158.42]  Yeah. I have no idea what we can do about it to be perfectly honest.
[162.58 --> 164.26]  We don't have that.
[166.74 --> 168.26]  Oh, you mean the snowball.
[168.82 --> 169.38]  Snowball.
[169.38 --> 176.98]  Okay. Okay. Yeah, maybe we'll try it. We'll try the snowball and we'll try just turning off the audio on the camera itself. Is it still popping?
[180.34 --> 181.14]  Oh, okay.
[181.14 --> 184.42]  Okay. Well, if it seemed fine then okay, I gotta go. I'm sort of live.
[184.74 --> 185.14]  Okay.
[185.14 --> 186.82]  Sorry guys, it's all Diesel's fault.
[186.82 --> 190.42]  He's actually admitted that it's his fault right here on the phone with me.
[190.42 --> 192.42]  He's explaining that he broke it.
[192.42 --> 196.26]  So thank you. Thank you for for explaining that. Thank you. Bye.
[198.34 --> 201.22]  So the Neos 8200. I've had people posting,
[201.22 --> 204.82]  Why does are you trolling us? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You've uploaded this three times.
[204.82 --> 214.18]  Yeah, I've uploaded it three times. You know what? I've also fixed the AV sync three times and it seems to be something that is,
[214.18 --> 217.14]  you know, magically fine in my video editing program.
[217.14 --> 222.90]  And then he says it's fine now. And if they're saying it's fine now, then I guess it's fine now. We might as well get going.
[223.70 --> 228.74]  So if it's something that's magically fixed when I fix it and then I upload it and YouTube breaks it,
[228.74 --> 232.82]  there's not a whole lot of anything that I can do about that.
[232.82 --> 236.50]  The issue, I would be afraid to even, okay, yeah, he's not plugging it in.
[238.26 --> 243.78]  Honestly, I don't even know what's causing the issue because like I said, I cannot reproduce the error.
[243.78 --> 250.50]  And all this equipment sort of is fine and good as long as it wants to love you and wants to work.
[250.50 --> 252.50]  But a lot of the times it does not.
[255.46 --> 257.62]  Want to talk about what happened with the forum today?
[258.82 --> 262.42]  I'll let Slick handle that one while I go adjust the camera to make it level.
[262.42 --> 275.14]  So I was off benchmarking a 8800 GT versus a 660 Ti on a fairly legacy platform just to show
[275.70 --> 279.86]  how much of a performance increase you would get from swapping out just a card instead of
[279.86 --> 286.98]  improving your entire build. Anyways, Diesel and Linus are off filming. Linus goes to toss a flash drive to
[286.98 --> 292.26]  Diesel, but Diesel has no idea it's coming. So Diesel tries to freak out and grab it real quick,
[292.26 --> 298.58]  but misses. It deflects off Diesel's hand, flies into the open server. It would be hilarious if
[298.58 --> 301.14]  Mr. Wizard's watching because I haven't explained this to him yet.
[303.06 --> 306.98]  Flies into the open server and hits the SSD that's just like sitting in the bottom.
[308.66 --> 314.02]  When it hits the SSD, it unplugs the SATA data cable and the whole server is just like
[314.02 --> 320.98]  freaks out. I have no idea that it unplugged. So I'm sitting there talking to Mr. Wizard and Mr.
[320.98 --> 325.86]  Wizard's like, oh, drive failures. There's drive failures. What's going on? What's going on?
[325.86 --> 330.18]  I can't control the server. I can't shut it down. I can't do anything. So I start freaking out. I shut
[330.18 --> 334.18]  it down, start messing with it, go into BIOS, all this kind of stuff. It's not detecting the SSD. I have
[334.18 --> 340.10]  no idea why. I have no idea what happened. Linus leaves because he has to go do some stuff.
[340.10 --> 348.34]  Um, and Diesel just gets to witness me absolutely freaking out as my server is down. Eventually,
[348.34 --> 353.62]  I figured out that the SSD was unplugged and it was because of the flash drive that Linus threw in there.
[353.62 --> 361.38]  In my defense, it was a pretty good throw. That's impressive. To have it like go from across the
[361.38 --> 366.58]  entire room and hit a cable on a drive and actually like dislodging is quite impressive. No,
[366.58 --> 371.62]  it's quite impressive. And that and the cable on the drive was like legit plugged like into it and
[371.62 --> 376.66]  then the drive itself is bolted to the bottom of the case. Yeah. So I can't even like, it's probably
[376.66 --> 382.02]  a one in a million shot. Oh yeah. Like it's kind of miraculous. Like you could throw that USB. And the
[382.02 --> 386.90]  thing too though, is that the way the drive was oriented was the drive was oriented this way. This is the
[386.90 --> 395.06]  back of the drive. And then the USB thumb drive came in at this angle. So to hit it from the back
[395.62 --> 400.34]  and unplug it. It must have like bounced off of something and then came back out or something.
[400.34 --> 405.06]  I don't even know. I don't even know. It's just absolutely miraculous. One in one in a freaking
[405.06 --> 410.66]  million for sure. Is our is our YouTube video up announcing the live stream? Yep. Should be up.
[411.46 --> 417.38]  All right. Did you put the link under the video and everything? Yeah. Wow. With slash new on it. So
[417.38 --> 422.50]  they'll get the new UI. That UI. By the way guys, if you're watching on Twitch TV, which is the only way
[422.50 --> 430.10]  you could be watching, type slash new at the end of your URL bar and it'll give you the cool new Twitch UI.
[430.10 --> 434.26]  I like it a lot. You should check it out. Oh, they want to know what happened to my parents. Zeke's on the
[434.26 --> 441.54]  trip. I just saw that in the Twitch chat. Um, what happened was I, um, got, did I, what, why did I,
[441.54 --> 449.46]  why did that? Okay. Well, I sat on them. I sat on them on the plane and I was super disappointed about
[449.46 --> 454.74]  the results because shoot, you know what? I don't feel like going and getting them right now, but basically
[454.74 --> 460.26]  the ear cups are supposed to rotate 90 degrees one way and then stop the other way so that when
[460.26 --> 466.26]  you put them around your, around your neck, they don't just like flop all over the place and could
[466.26 --> 470.74]  be sort of anywhere so that they stay kind of like look like headphones around your neck. And when you
[470.74 --> 476.50]  go to pick them up and put them on your ears, they're not just sort of oriented funny. Um, so I sat on them
[476.50 --> 482.58]  and actually forced one of the ear cups 90 degrees the other direction. So one of them is correct
[482.58 --> 489.86]  and one of them goes all the way around 180 degrees. And, um, so I, you know, with all the
[489.86 --> 494.90]  things that go wrong around here, it's a miracle we release any videos at all. I was gonna say,
[494.90 --> 504.34]  today's live stream, how Linus breaks things. Hold on. I didn't, I didn't break the audio and I didn't
[504.34 --> 509.54]  break that video. Although maybe I didn't fix it properly. Whatever. I just, I took off the third
[509.54 --> 518.18]  attempt. It's not there. And I, uh, and I'm leaving the one that was not as bad as the first one, but
[518.98 --> 523.86]  there's nothing I can do about the audio popping in that video. We can't re-film an unboxing,
[523.86 --> 529.14]  unfortunately, because an unboxing is an unboxing. It inherently only has one chance of being good.
[529.14 --> 534.02]  Yeah. Um, so it's the nature of, it's the nature of the beast a little bit and I'm sorry,
[534.02 --> 539.54]  there's really just nothing we can do about that. I do have something exciting to announce in 15
[539.54 --> 544.58]  minutes, but I guess I can kind of, I can kind of wait for that. In 15 minutes? Oh yeah, I don't
[544.58 --> 550.18]  know if you even know about this. Um, I guess you can't tell me right now. No, I can tell, oh wait,
[550.18 --> 555.70]  no I can't. Right, because they're there. We could just, we could just have some more audio issues and
[555.70 --> 560.34]  they could just not be there. No, that's fine. I'm okay with waiting 15 minutes. Okay, well here,
[560.34 --> 567.62]  how about this? I'll put you on the spot. What was your highlight of CES? My highlight of CES?
[567.62 --> 574.50]  Probably the Swift Tech. Really? Well, that was really cool to meet Gabriel Sean. Okay. That was
[574.50 --> 578.02]  pretty damn cool. Pretend you're talking to them and not to me, because I know exactly what happened,
[578.02 --> 584.50]  but they don't. Like the whole story? Yeah. Okay, so. That's the point of a talk show. So we have no time,
[584.50 --> 591.62]  because we're kind of insane and we pulled ridiculous hours there. It starts with Project
[591.62 --> 596.42]  Shield basically, because we were there the previous day. Well, tell that part. Okay, okay,
[596.42 --> 601.38]  I'll tell that part then. Okay, so it starts with Project Shield. I don't know if you guys noticed,
[601.38 --> 607.94]  but our Project Shield coverage went up three, four days after everyone else's. Um, so the reason for that
[607.94 --> 613.38]  was that we didn't know about Project Shield because we didn't, well, I mean, we knew about it,
[613.38 --> 617.30]  but we didn't know about, you know, when they were doing press briefings or if they were doing press
[617.30 --> 625.86]  briefings or any of the other stuff. Um, Diesel wants to be a mod in chat. Okay. Uh, so when and if they
[625.86 --> 630.74]  were doing press briefings. So, so we got kind of, we were on the list kind of late. So we showed up,
[630.74 --> 634.90]  um, sort of a couple days afterwards, because we, we weren't at the show for the first day.
[634.90 --> 640.58]  And we were like, okay, so, uh, can we get in? Can you squeeze us in? And the guys at Invidia were
[640.58 --> 645.46]  like, yeah, yeah, like, we really want to get you in. Um, hang around for like 20 minutes and,
[645.46 --> 650.82]  uh, and we'll get you in. So we were like, okay, we only have 20 minutes because we have to be
[650.82 --> 656.74]  on a bus in 30 minutes and it's 10 minutes away. So that's like cutting it really close. We're going
[656.74 --> 662.74]  to be late for the bus. So we waited 20 minutes. And then as we were walking away, we had to go. We had a
[662.74 --> 667.14]  bus that was taking us to an event that we had to be there for. If we didn't catch the bus,
[667.14 --> 672.82]  we'd have to wait in the cab line, which is what? 45 minutes? Yeah. Easily, maybe an hour. So like,
[672.82 --> 678.58]  we weren't going to make it to the event if we didn't get the shuttle. Um, so we got the, we got
[678.58 --> 682.50]  the call from them five minutes after we'd left saying, oh, we're ready for you. And I was like,
[682.50 --> 687.70]  crap, we can't come. We were not planning to go to the show the following day because we had meetings
[687.70 --> 693.38]  booked and like suite tours booked all over the Vegas strip, like nowhere near the convention
[693.38 --> 698.26]  center for that day. So we're like, crap, this was our chance to get to project shield. We missed it.
[698.26 --> 705.38]  So we get to the bus and someone else is late by like 30 minutes. So we're sitting there on the bus
[705.38 --> 709.62]  looking at our watches. We don't wear watches, but figuratively looking at our watches going,
[710.34 --> 716.42]  holy crap, whoever that last person is like might get, might get just decked because
[717.14 --> 722.50]  the worst part is they keep on making the bus driver move because he was taking up too much space.
[722.50 --> 727.78]  So we just get this like repeated, like, oh, we're so close to shield and then back away.
[727.78 --> 732.26]  And then, oh, we can just go in and film it and then back away. And we didn't know like how long
[732.26 --> 736.42]  the bus was going to wait. We kept, we kept asking. They kept telling us, oh, soon, soon, soon. So we're
[736.42 --> 742.42]  like, okay, okay, we'll wait, we'll wait. Um, so yeah, that backfired. So we had to go back the next day,
[742.42 --> 748.90]  which means we had to reschedule some stuff. We missed NZXT. And I was really super depressed
[748.90 --> 753.94]  about that. And the way that I had made it because, because it takes a really long time to get to and
[753.94 --> 758.50]  from the convention center because of the cab lineups. I mean, we could hire a limo to do it,
[758.50 --> 765.78]  I guess, but yeah, no big deal. A hundred dollars, you know, each, exactly. Um, so I was like, okay,
[766.74 --> 772.74]  I'll send Slick to the Swift Tech suite to just kind of, you know, talk to them and, uh, and I'll
[772.74 --> 777.06]  take Diesel and we'll go film shield. So Slick didn't even get to see shield, which by the way,
[777.06 --> 783.22]  totally sucks because shield's awesome. Yeah. And oh, did I mention it's freaking awesome? I watched the video.
[783.22 --> 787.38]  Diesel got to just sit and play with it for like 10 minutes. No, I know. Yeah, I know.
[789.78 --> 795.06]  It's awesome. I'm still happy. Did I mention you can run Android games? Yes. And you can also
[795.06 --> 799.14]  stream games from the PC. I know. Okay, anyway, project shield's cool. And for those of you who
[799.14 --> 802.90]  don't think project shield's cool, you're wrong. And you're going to find out you're wrong
[802.90 --> 808.90]  in a year or 18 months or however long it takes for everyone to kind of figure out how frigging awesome
[808.90 --> 813.86]  this is and start buying them and start using them. So there you go. Uh, you can quote me on that.
[813.86 --> 818.34]  So, so project shield, blah, blah, blah. So, so I rescheduled Swift Tech. I was like, we can't make it.
[819.14 --> 826.34]  So I get this call from Slick. Okay. Well, you have to go log into Twitch. I can't make him a mod.
[829.22 --> 832.82]  Okay, right there. Make sure you pause the video so they don't all get hammered by audio.
[832.82 --> 840.26]  Okay. So bouncing back a little bit. This is before the call he got. Um, I show up and walk in,
[840.26 --> 845.62]  kind of like knock on the door. The door's open. Everybody's sitting there. Um, Gabriel Sean, CEO
[845.62 --> 850.98]  of a company in Germany, like, like a bunch of big guys sitting around on the couches. I walk in and
[850.98 --> 857.94]  they're like, hi. I'm like, oh, hey, I'm a part of the Linus Tech Tips team. Just kind of here on behalf
[857.94 --> 865.14]  of them. Just trying to see your demo. And Gabriel Sean's like, oh, Linus isn't here. I'm like, no,
[866.26 --> 871.22]  for context, Gabe and I go back about four, four and a half years. So it's kind of a,
[871.22 --> 876.26]  it's kind of a jerk move that I wasn't there, but I, it was that or shield. Come on guys.
[877.38 --> 881.70]  Basically, I eventually convinced him to give me the demo and the demo was awesome as you guys
[881.70 --> 886.02]  hopefully saw the videos. Um, there's a little bit of confusion about like a hand that came in and
[886.02 --> 891.14]  stuff, but no, no, no, it was all fair play. It was very cool. Um, and I saw the demo. I saw that
[891.14 --> 894.58]  you could take it apart. Like I had heard they were releasing one, but I hadn't heard anything
[894.58 --> 898.58]  about it until I got there. So he showed me the hands-on demo with the actual device and then the
[898.58 --> 903.70]  demo with all the computers set up. Then I called Linus and was like, you have to be here because we
[903.70 --> 910.18]  have to film this because this is awesome. So he somehow scrambles all the way over there. I'm still
[910.18 --> 918.02]  not entirely sure how, and then shows up instantly starts filming. I leave because they have to film.
[918.02 --> 924.42]  I go wait in the taxi lineup and then when he's done filming, he runs down, gets in the taxi lineup
[924.42 --> 932.18]  instead of me, gets in a cab. I sprint back upstairs, grab all the stuff with Diesel and Diesel and I run
[932.18 --> 939.46]  to the TT Esports booth while you meet with Intel or something. Yeah. And then eventually we meet back up.
[939.46 --> 945.94]  Like missing that meeting was not an option. No. And, uh, oh, I actually, I guess I never told you this. So
[945.94 --> 953.06]  the way I got to the, uh, convention center so quickly was instead of, of sort of going to one
[953.06 --> 958.90]  place and then waiting for something and going to another place, I just hijacked the, uh, the, uh, the ride
[958.90 --> 965.14]  that we had from Coolumaster. Coolumaster, right. Yeah. So, so I, I, he was, I was like, can you take us to the
[965.14 --> 973.62]  convention center after dropping one of our guys off there? And he's just like, um, I guess so.
[973.62 --> 980.26]  And meanwhile, like we're halfway to the convention center after dropping you off and he's like getting
[980.26 --> 984.58]  calls for like other places he needs to be. And I'm just like, I'm sitting in the back. I'm just like,
[984.58 --> 991.94]  do, do, do, do, do, do. Thank you. But that made all the difference because that probably saved us
[991.94 --> 997.38]  half an hour right there, which was all the, I was, I didn't have that much leeway time. Like did not.
[997.38 --> 1002.98]  I was in the Swift Tech suite, like physically there for probably like 25 minutes. That was it.
[1002.98 --> 1009.94]  So the, uh, the first part, um, I got briefed on the cooler itself and then we filmed sort of together
[1009.94 --> 1013.86]  and then I was just like, okay, we're running out of time. Gabe, uh, why don't you give the demo
[1013.86 --> 1018.26]  in real time? Uh, and we'll just like, we'll, we'll do it together on this part.
[1020.34 --> 1024.42]  Oh my goodness. Gabe Ruchon is a really good guy. He was really cool to meet.
[1024.42 --> 1030.82]  So no one asked, but, uh, my highlight of the show is going to actually be Project Shield. Um,
[1030.82 --> 1036.10]  I didn't get to see it. I know that it's kind of an obvious one, but there's a lot of things that I
[1036.10 --> 1041.86]  like about this general concept. I mean, I, I have like, I, I have a DS somewhere. It doesn't work
[1041.86 --> 1048.10]  anymore, but I used it when I used my DS and this might sound crazy to some of you folks. I actually
[1048.10 --> 1054.18]  used it at home a fair bit. Yeah. Like, like, yeah, I used it out and about, but I actually used it at
[1054.18 --> 1058.42]  home as well because there's sort of a different set of games and it's a different set of controls.
[1058.42 --> 1065.78]  The ergonomics of playing games on a handheld console versus playing games on, what time is it?
[1065.78 --> 1070.66]  Okay. Eight more minutes until the big announcement. Um, versus playing games on the stupid phone.
[1070.66 --> 1075.46]  I mean, like there are other solutions. Like there's the, uh, SteelSeries 3, which is a little
[1075.46 --> 1081.46]  controller. It's too small. It's small, especially for you. And where do you put the phone? Like, here,
[1081.46 --> 1085.70]  what? You just find like a friend and just be like, yeah, can you just, we're on the bus,
[1085.70 --> 1089.30]  right? I got my Bluetooth thing. Just be like, yeah, can you just sit there like that and hold
[1089.30 --> 1093.54]  that for me? Like it's, it's, it's not feasible. There's something to be said for having
[1094.42 --> 1098.74]  them pre-attached like that. And I've seen, he's asking to mod him again. Did you not mod him?
[1100.26 --> 1103.46]  You had to log in. Oh, I haven't logged in yet.
[1103.46 --> 1110.90]  Oh, right. Okay. I haven't logged in yet. Uh, I will soon. I will soon, Diesel. Um, what was I saying?
[1113.14 --> 1116.74]  Right, right, right. So there's something to be said for having it attached. Now, I've had some people
[1116.74 --> 1121.94]  say that you should just be able to take your Tegra for a phone and put it in there and whatever else.
[1121.94 --> 1127.62]  But there's something to be said for a highly integrated experience with purpose-made hardware.
[1127.62 --> 1134.18]  That's why a PlayStation 3 is able to run games better than a similar generation PC. That's why
[1134.18 --> 1139.14]  they look better on the PlayStation 3. Purpose-built hardware will all work together and they want
[1139.14 --> 1143.46]  you to have an experience that's consistent regardless of what you're doing. So I think
[1143.46 --> 1147.70]  there's something to be said for the form factor. The ergonomics are awesome. The fit and finish of
[1147.70 --> 1151.38]  the units that people saw, it's like some of the problems that they're complaining about where they're
[1151.38 --> 1157.46]  not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. My understanding is Nvidia didn't even intend to
[1157.46 --> 1164.98]  show Project Shield hands-on. They decided at the last minute, oh, well everyone's demanding this, so um...
[1166.66 --> 1170.90]  Okay then. Okay then. What was with that bracket? I didn't really get that entirely. They just like
[1170.90 --> 1176.34]  slapped a bracket on it just so it wouldn't work at CES? Yeah, that's awesome. The bracket is custom made
[1176.34 --> 1180.66]  so that the cables, like normally you wouldn't run it with a bunch of friggin cables running out of it,
[1180.66 --> 1187.14]  so that the cables won't just like break off the connectors which are fragile on the pre-release consoles
[1187.46 --> 1192.10]  So epic. I mean, I... I think that's very cool. The thing that's even more exciting about all of this,
[1192.10 --> 1199.86]  I guess, is just the idea of Nvidia, a company that really properly caters to gamers. We're not talking
[1199.86 --> 1206.34]  about Sony or Microsoft where what they really want you to do is rent movies through your stupid gaming
[1206.34 --> 1213.06]  console. We're talking a company that actually is games, games, games, games, games, getting into the
[1213.06 --> 1218.66]  console race. That's what's happening here. I mean, through Tegra Zone, they're encouraging
[1219.54 --> 1225.70]  Android game developers to optimize for Tegra, which is basically GeForce. With Tegra 4, we're going
[1225.70 --> 1231.78]  to get a ton more power. With dedicated hardware that goes along with Tegra 4 and this console gaming
[1231.78 --> 1237.54]  experience, we're going to get, well, a physical console to go with it. And I'm extremely excited
[1237.54 --> 1241.62]  about what the future is going to be like. I mean, I think now's a good time to buy Nvidia stock. And, you know,
[1241.62 --> 1246.58]  all the usual blah, blah, blah. I have no Nvidia stock and I'm not intending to take a position.
[1246.58 --> 1251.06]  I had Nvidia stock at one point. I made a few bucks and then I don't have any stocks right now. So,
[1251.06 --> 1257.78]  there you go. Don't take stock advice from me. I'm not a hardcore investor. But, find something to
[1257.78 --> 1263.54]  talk about. Oh, talk about what we filmed today and I'll go log into Twitch. What we filmed today?
[1263.54 --> 1268.58]  Yeah, we filmed a bunch of stuff today, didn't we? The Netlake Weekly we filmed. Oh, talk about the upgrade
[1268.58 --> 1273.94]  thing. That's a cool topic. Okay. Okay. So, as I said earlier, when he threw a flash drive in and
[1273.94 --> 1283.54]  shut down my server, the video that I was working on prepping is a legacy system DDR2 kind of platform,
[1283.54 --> 1291.54]  Samsung 5. Yeah, the X6800 dual core. X6800 dual core, Samsung 5 machine. This one.
[1296.66 --> 1307.38]  This machine with an 8800DT, as you can see right there. I benched that running Dirt 3, Far Cry 3,
[1307.38 --> 1315.46]  and Crysis 2. And then I benched that exact same thing minus the graphics card, but with a 660 Ti on
[1315.46 --> 1321.46]  it and compared results. It was pretty interesting. I kind of expected more, but then I guess that's
[1321.46 --> 1326.74]  because it hit pretty hard bottlenecks. But still, I kind of expected a little bit more. In Far Cry 3,
[1326.74 --> 1332.26]  we saw about a 15 frame per second increase in... Oh, I'm going to forget all these numbers.
[1332.26 --> 1337.14]  In Dirt and Crysis, it was a little bit lower because those are both a little bit more CPU bound.
[1338.02 --> 1343.62]  In Dirt, I think it was about 8 or 9 FPS higher. And then in Crysis 2, I think it was around 10.
[1344.50 --> 1347.94]  I think that's about where it was. So that's kind of interesting. We're going to do a follow-up
[1347.94 --> 1351.54]  video with that about upgrading everything else other than your graphics card. Are we doing
[1351.54 --> 1355.30]  everything other than your graphics card? I think we're going to do like CPU upgrade. I mean,
[1355.30 --> 1359.14]  I guess the... You kind of need to upgrade your platform then. Yeah, pretty much. I mean,
[1359.14 --> 1363.30]  I guess the conversation here is should you upgrade piecemeal or should you not? I mean,
[1363.30 --> 1366.58]  what would you recommend at this point? Probably a bucket upgrade.
[1369.46 --> 1376.42]  Basically, the idea is upgrading just your graphics card or upgrading your whole system. So as we saw
[1376.42 --> 1379.70]  today, like I said, I expect a little bit more from just your graphics card, so I'd probably just
[1379.70 --> 1385.86]  recommend upgrading your entire system. That's pretty much just how it goes. You kind of... I see a lot
[1385.86 --> 1390.82]  of people that are like, oh, I make this much a month that I can spend and I want to build a
[1390.82 --> 1396.34]  computer over the next eight months. So I'm going to buy a part every month and then just slowly piece
[1396.34 --> 1400.34]  together my computer. That's not usually the best way to go about it because by the time you get to
[1400.34 --> 1404.98]  your last bit of parts, all your first stuff is kind of outdated and not that great anymore.
[1405.70 --> 1410.98]  So what is probably a better idea is just saving up for that X amount of months and then buying it all
[1410.98 --> 1415.86]  kind of at once or buying it all within the same month so you can hit multiple sales. Something like
[1415.86 --> 1422.98]  that. AMD guys stealing from NVIDIA. Oh my goodness. In our Netlinked Weekly, we covered a topic about AMD...
[1423.78 --> 1431.14]  No, it was... Yeah. Employees of AMD taking 100,000 documents, putting them on like flash drives and
[1431.14 --> 1437.94]  external hard drives is apparently what they're saying, and then quitting, joining NVIDIA and serving
[1437.94 --> 1443.78]  all those documents to NVIDIA. So that's 100,000 like confidential documents. And this isn't like
[1443.78 --> 1449.54]  patent stuff, this isn't like release stuff, this is confidential AMD documents. So not entirely sure
[1450.26 --> 1456.18]  what's in them, but I'm assuming like new technologies that AMD is working on, etc, etc.
[1456.18 --> 1463.78]  So that's not cool. Like not cool at all. This isn't like where Google sees someone because they used
[1463.78 --> 1469.46]  some... they used round edges. Not cool. This is like you could totally screw over a company. Not cool.
[1471.30 --> 1478.50]  What are your thoughts on it? I think that it is absolutely insane to do that. Not only is it wrong,
[1478.50 --> 1485.14]  but it's just like it opens them up to personal liability in a huge, huge way.
[1487.30 --> 1489.78]  One interesting thing that I read was that NVIDIA was
[1489.78 --> 1497.30]  in the know about this as it was happening. Apparently. Allegedly. Allegedly. So we're not
[1497.30 --> 1504.26]  exactly sure about that yet. But that could bode well, could not bode well for NVIDIA if that's true.
[1504.26 --> 1509.06]  And like, is it really worth doing that? That's one thing I find with the employees. Like,
[1509.06 --> 1513.94]  you're stealing all this stuff from an employer that employed you for a really long time and going to
[1513.94 --> 1519.14]  another employer. That new employer is probably not going to trust you that much in general because you
[1519.14 --> 1522.74]  just stole so much stuff from your ex-employer. So why should they believe that you're not going
[1522.74 --> 1528.82]  to do that to them? And if anyone ever hears about it like they did, you're pretty much screwed.
[1528.82 --> 1533.62]  Because that's all on you. That's also on NVIDIA if NVIDIA knew about it. We're not entirely sure about
[1533.62 --> 1540.66]  that yet. But I don't know. Totally not worth it. The forum. If you guys have noticed over the last
[1540.66 --> 1548.34]  kind of day or two, there's been a couple kind of sketchy downtimes. Last night was a beta upgrade to
[1548.34 --> 1559.54]  beta 25. Okay, hold that thought. Oh. Yay! A collaborative video with the one and only Unbox Therapy.
[1560.18 --> 1567.62]  So it is 9 30. So hopefully Lou is, Lou is releasing his video over there. And apparently my,
[1567.62 --> 1572.34]  my wireless keyboard and mouse isn't even working. So I just want to show you guys,
[1572.34 --> 1578.66]  I want to show you guys, I want to show you guys where the forward slash is on this stupid keyboard.
[1581.14 --> 1590.10]  It's right there. You know what? Calm down. We're just going to search for it. It's like literally right there.
[1590.10 --> 1597.78]  I think that, I think that you're being a negative Nancy. You shut down my server. All right. So guys,
[1598.50 --> 1606.90]  if you are not already familiar with Unbox Therapy, this is the channel of my fellow Canadian,
[1606.90 --> 1612.66]  Lou Hiltesentger, or whatever, however you spell his last name, Hilsentager, Hilsentager,
[1612.66 --> 1618.02]  whatever. He's a good guy, nice guy, does unboxings. Here's his NVIDIA Project Shield video,
[1618.02 --> 1624.50]  which actually has fewer views than mine. So good try Lou. But, uh, no, I'm, I'm just,
[1624.50 --> 1629.22]  I'm just trolling him. Like I said, good guy, Unbox Therapy. We got together and we wanted to bring
[1629.22 --> 1636.02]  you guys a special Christmas collaborative video. It's a little bit past Christmas. Yeah,
[1636.02 --> 1642.82]  life's been pretty busy for both of us, actually. We were both at CES. So he was at CES. I was at CES.
[1642.82 --> 1646.26]  We didn't even manage to meet up at CES. That's how busy we've been,
[1646.26 --> 1652.66]  even though we were supposed to be doing a collaborative video. So this right here is the
[1652.66 --> 1659.46]  prize pack. We are giving it away together. So Lou has contributed to us obtaining these prizes
[1659.46 --> 1666.58]  equally to me. So, uh, it is very much a joint effort. I want you guys to make sure you're subscribed
[1666.58 --> 1674.26]  to both Linus Tech Tips and Unbox Therapy and need you to leave a comment under both the video on the
[1674.26 --> 1680.66]  Linus Tech Tips channel and the video on the Unbox Therapy channel for your chance to win a
[1680.66 --> 1688.02]  QCK Plus Limited Edition MLG Officially Licensed Mouse Pad. The packaging got a little bit busted,
[1688.02 --> 1694.50]  but I assure you the actual mouse pad that's in there is new. A SteelSeries Sensei, uh, what is this?
[1694.50 --> 1700.74]  This is like the Sensei Pro one. It's the, uh, yeah, this is the MLG sponsored version. A SteelSeries,
[1700.74 --> 1706.10]  so, oh, right. So, okay. So what is so good about a Sensei is a question that you might have if you
[1706.10 --> 1710.58]  don't know anything about gaming peripherals because the Sensei is friggin awesome. Uh, very,
[1710.58 --> 1715.94]  very accurate. SteelSeries software is excellent. I definitely endorse this mouse and what I like
[1715.94 --> 1721.22]  about the Pro MLG version one here is that it has a soft touch feel versus, did you know that?
[1721.22 --> 1729.22]  Soft touch instead of the, uh, yeah, I believe it's soft touch. That's awesome. Uh, soft touch on the sides, I think. Looks like it. Looks like it. That's perfect.
[1729.22 --> 1739.30]  So, it's, uh, it's more, it's a little bit nicer to use than the non-MLG version, which is the, uh, which is just kind of like plastic.
[1739.30 --> 1745.22]  Yeah. And I don't, I don't like it as much as I like the previous generation's eye. SteelSeries 7H,
[1745.22 --> 1755.22]  so I think you can probably imagine which one between me and Lou came up with the idea of having a SteelSeries 7H as an ultimate gaming peripheral prize pack.
[1755.22 --> 1764.22]  I love the 7H. This is the analog version, not the USB version, at least that's what I asked for. Should be, yeah, analog version.
[1764.22 --> 1774.22]  Um, which is my favorite gaming headset because it actually sounds good in things other than games. You can watch movies, you can listen to music, it is a very good headset.
[1774.22 --> 1781.22]  The only issue with it is be careful with the little connector down here. You don't want to like throw them off and have that connector come flying out.
[1781.22 --> 1785.22]  It can be a little bit fragile, but as long as you've got a good audio source, you're going to love that.
[1785.22 --> 1793.22]  And finally, a Corsair Vengeance K90 blue backlit full mechanical, not quite full mechanical, sorry, mechanical gaming keyboard.
[1793.22 --> 1796.22]  So remember that top row is not mechanical, that's why I made that mistake there.
[1796.22 --> 1801.22]  Um, so Vengeance K90 completes your ultimate gaming prize pack.
[1801.22 --> 1808.22]  So again, subscribe to Linus Tech Tips, subscribe to Unbox Therapy, comment under the videos on both of our channels announcing the contest,
[1808.22 --> 1816.22]  and we will announce the winners. We haven't discussed that. So, we will announce the winners!
[1816.22 --> 1818.22]  No time frame was given.
[1818.22 --> 1819.22]  DVD.
[1819.22 --> 1825.22]  Yeah, to be determined. So, love to hear your feedback on sort of giveaways and collaborations like this.
[1825.22 --> 1836.22]  This is actually my first time collaborating with another channel on a giveaway, and like with a video that I actually upload to the channel and stuff like that.
[1836.22 --> 1840.22]  So, what do you think? Good idea? Bad idea?
[1840.22 --> 1845.22]  It's cool because whoever wins gets a full set of awesome gaming peripherals.
[1845.22 --> 1850.22]  Okay. That is the most neutral observation about anything that I've ever heard ever.
[1850.22 --> 1853.22]  I don't know, we've never done a collab before. I think it could be cool.
[1853.22 --> 1855.22]  I think the video is funny enough.
[1855.22 --> 1862.22]  You know what? We haven't taken any of your tweets yet tonight, so I'm going to go ahead and find the keyboard,
[1862.22 --> 1871.22]  which is hiding behind Slick's monstrous form, and let's go ahead and let's take some tweets.
[1871.22 --> 1881.22]  Switching to the Twitter, and switching to the Connect, and stopping with the Franglais now.
[1881.22 --> 1884.22]  You have been updating your rig, time to... Ah, yes. Okay.
[1884.22 --> 1887.22]  You know what? Slick actually brought this up to me today.
[1887.22 --> 1896.22]  I told them. I was like, you don't have your rig up yet, but DTL has finished Orca.
[1896.22 --> 1903.22]  Yes, Orca is good, and Orca is better than my machine, but I have a baby, so bam.
[1903.22 --> 1905.22]  You didn't have a baby before.
[1905.22 --> 1907.22]  Well, I was preparing to have a baby.
[1907.22 --> 1910.22]  Hey, I had to rent on the nursery. That took time.
[1910.22 --> 1911.22]  Right. Right.
[1911.22 --> 1913.22]  I did things.
[1913.22 --> 1916.22]  That's hilarious.
[1916.22 --> 1919.22]  No, Ricky, you do not need to do that.
[1921.22 --> 1925.22]  All right. Thank you, Derek. Thank you for enjoying our CES coverage.
[1925.22 --> 1927.22]  We worked extremely hard.
[1927.22 --> 1928.22]  Yeah.
[1928.22 --> 1931.22]  I really hope that came through to you guys.
[1931.22 --> 1934.22]  Yeah.
[1934.22 --> 1936.22]  How many hours did we sleep per night?
[1936.22 --> 1938.22]  Three to four?
[1938.22 --> 1939.22]  Max?
[1939.22 --> 1940.22]  Yeah.
[1940.22 --> 1941.22]  Three to four max.
[1941.22 --> 1943.22]  I think Diesel probably slept less than anyone.
[1943.22 --> 1944.22]  Three to two.
[1944.22 --> 1946.22]  That guy is a party animal.
[1946.22 --> 1947.22]  Like, just...
[1947.22 --> 1948.22]  He is a machine.
[1948.22 --> 1953.22]  I have no idea how he did it because, guys, he was out there with us all day filming,
[1953.22 --> 1956.22]  carrying crap around, and filming crap, and...
[1956.22 --> 1958.22]  Well, filming good things.
[1958.22 --> 1959.22]  Not carrying crap around.
[1959.22 --> 1962.22]  Carrying around expensive cameras that are extremely heavy.
[1962.22 --> 1964.22]  So, there was that.
[1964.22 --> 1969.22]  And then we'd have, like, meetings, and then we'd have, like, parties we had to go to to
[1969.22 --> 1974.22]  mingle and schmooze, and then we'd get back, and I think he'd sometimes sleep for, like, an hour.
[1974.22 --> 1978.22]  An hour or two, and then he'd get back up and start editing, and then sleep for an hour, and then...
[1978.22 --> 1980.22]  Get back up and start it all over.
[1980.22 --> 1981.22]  Amazing.
[1981.22 --> 1982.22]  Amazing.
[1982.22 --> 1984.22]  The guy, the guy's a tank, so...
[1984.22 --> 1986.22]  Uh, that was, that was really fun.
[1986.22 --> 1987.22]  Sort of.
[1987.22 --> 1989.22]  Any news about NVIDIA's GTX 700 series?
[1989.22 --> 1990.22]  You know what, guys?
[1990.22 --> 1996.22]  I can't comment on unreleased hardware because I signed these things called NDAs, non-disclosure agreements,
[1996.22 --> 1997.22]  so...
[1997.22 --> 2009.22]  I get the privilege of being able to see the hardware and use it before it's released, but that comes with the responsibility of not talking about it until it's actually released, so...
[2009.22 --> 2010.22]  Um...
[2010.22 --> 2011.22]  Yeah...
[2011.22 --> 2017.22]  Phyos and Jupy-jup, I just wanted to say, you guys are great, thank you!
[2017.22 --> 2018.22]  Um...
[2018.22 --> 2026.22]  I think Rockat has something inbound on the, uh, the Ryos MK Pro thing.
[2026.22 --> 2027.22]  Okay.
[2027.22 --> 2028.22]  Cool.
[2028.22 --> 2036.22]  Wow, nobody is commenting on anything about the giveaway, so why don't we go ahead and see if any of these 71 interactions are about the giveaway.
[2036.22 --> 2038.22]  Uh, they are not.
[2038.22 --> 2040.22]  Hi from the UK, hi back to the UK!
[2040.22 --> 2041.22]  Okay, get Diesel on Skype.
[2041.22 --> 2045.22]  We actually were thinking about adding Diesel on Skype, but we ended up...
[2045.22 --> 2050.22]  When we got back here, I had to follow up on some emails, like very very urgently.
[2050.22 --> 2051.22]  Slick had to fix the forum.
[2051.22 --> 2054.22]  Have you even talked about all the posts that were gone and you had to fix?
[2054.22 --> 2055.22]  No.
[2055.22 --> 2056.22]  Okay.
[2056.22 --> 2057.22]  I don't believe we covered that yet.
[2057.22 --> 2059.22]  I'm not entirely sure if it's working.
[2059.22 --> 2063.22]  Okay then, so Slick had to work on the forum.
[2063.22 --> 2064.22]  That thing that he broke.
[2064.22 --> 2065.22]  Hey!
[2065.22 --> 2066.22]  Um...
[2066.22 --> 2072.22]  So we actually were gonna try and get Diesel on the livestream tonight, but it didn't happen.
[2072.22 --> 2074.22]  If nothing else guys, he's in the Twitch chat.
[2074.22 --> 2075.22]  So join the Twitch chat.
[2075.22 --> 2077.22]  He's there, he's one of the moderators, so...
[2077.22 --> 2079.22]  Diesel the intern in the Twitch chat.
[2079.22 --> 2080.22]  Yeah.
[2080.22 --> 2081.22]  Diesel the intern in Twitch.
[2081.22 --> 2084.22]  You can tell because he's a mod, so that's the right one.
[2084.22 --> 2085.22]  Yeah.
[2085.22 --> 2088.22]  Would you suggest using a backplate for a graphics card without a water block?
[2088.22 --> 2091.22]  Yeah, it provides a little support, it looks nice, it adds a little bit of cooling, it does
[2091.22 --> 2095.22]  absolutely nothing for the actual frames per second you're getting, so as long as you
[2095.22 --> 2099.22]  understand what you're getting and what you're not getting, go for it.
[2099.22 --> 2101.22]  They look great, that's usually my reason for it.
[2101.22 --> 2102.22]  Yeah, they look really good.
[2102.22 --> 2103.22]  Yeah.
[2103.22 --> 2104.22]  They feature...
[2104.22 --> 2105.22]  Wow!
[2105.22 --> 2108.22]  Hey, apparently they featured our CES video of the Ares 2 on...
[2108.22 --> 2109.22]  I didn't even know that.
[2109.22 --> 2110.22]  I think they did for Raider as well.
[2110.22 --> 2114.22]  Oh, because I know Corsair has our 900D video.
[2114.22 --> 2115.22]  That's awesome.
[2115.22 --> 2116.22]  You know what?
[2116.22 --> 2122.22]  That was kind of funny, is we got there to the suite to see the Ares 2 and the Raider
[2122.22 --> 2127.22]  and some of the other cool stuff, and at the end of filming the video about Ares 2,
[2127.22 --> 2130.22]  I was like, oh well, can we take it out?
[2130.22 --> 2136.22]  And JJ was like, you know, no one else has asked.
[2136.22 --> 2137.22]  I don't...
[2137.22 --> 2138.22]  Well, here.
[2138.22 --> 2139.22]  Um...
[2139.22 --> 2140.22]  Yeah!
[2140.22 --> 2141.22]  Sure!
[2141.22 --> 2146.22]  We got nothing else right now, and I guess you guys will have like exclusive, you know,
[2146.22 --> 2150.22]  glamour shots of what the card actually looks like out of the case, because that was the
[2150.22 --> 2153.22]  first place they were showing Ares 2 at all.
[2153.22 --> 2157.22]  And he was like, yeah, I guess it just didn't occur to anyone else to ask, because they had
[2157.22 --> 2161.22]  it in like this machine, right, that was built and sort of...
[2161.22 --> 2163.22]  It was running and it was streaming footage and like this.
[2163.22 --> 2169.22]  Yeah, and I was just like, well, not to be totally unreasonable, but we'd love to use
[2169.22 --> 2173.22]  our fancy pants camera to take some awesome glamour shots.
[2173.22 --> 2178.22]  I actually tweeted a picture of Diesel working on those glam shots.
[2178.22 --> 2183.22]  We were using the light from the window coming in from Vegas, and we were like, you know,
[2183.22 --> 2184.22]  getting some really...
[2184.22 --> 2189.22]  I mean, I hope you guys appreciated, particularly on Ares 2, Project Shield.
[2189.22 --> 2195.22]  Those were probably the two where where Diesel spent the most time like really sort of...
[2195.22 --> 2197.22]  What's the word?
[2197.22 --> 2198.22]  Obsessing?
[2198.22 --> 2200.22]  Maybe that's not the right word.
[2200.22 --> 2205.22]  He's watching this, right?
[2205.22 --> 2209.22]  Over the little details of the footage that we were getting in the close-up.
[2209.22 --> 2211.22]  So I hope you guys appreciated that.
[2211.22 --> 2213.22]  Does Shield work with Mac?
[2213.22 --> 2215.22]  Who cares?
[2215.22 --> 2218.22]  What do you think about 680 for the win plus?
[2218.22 --> 2219.22]  I think that it's a 680.
[2219.22 --> 2221.22]  I think that it's overclocked.
[2221.22 --> 2225.22]  I think the plus means it has a back plate, and I think that it has 4 gigs of RAM.
[2225.22 --> 2227.22]  I get asked this all the time.
[2227.22 --> 2230.22]  What do you think about this particular skew of graphics card?
[2230.22 --> 2232.22]  I think it's a graphics card.
[2232.22 --> 2236.22]  I think that everything you need to know about it can be extrapolated from the information
[2236.22 --> 2238.22]  in the manufacturer's specifications.
[2238.22 --> 2242.22]  The overclock tells you how much faster it is than a regular one, and then everything else,
[2242.22 --> 2243.22]  particularly EVGA.
[2243.22 --> 2248.22]  I love EVGA because just by reading the name of the card, I know exactly what it looks like.
[2248.22 --> 2249.22]  I know if it has custom cooling.
[2249.22 --> 2251.22]  I know if it has a back plate.
[2251.22 --> 2253.22]  It's just kind of awesome.
[2253.22 --> 2255.22]  I think that it's a great card.
[2255.22 --> 2258.22]  I think that you'll be very happy with the frame rates you'll get.
[2258.22 --> 2264.22]  And I think that 4 gigs of RAM is mostly optimized for multiple monitors or high-res monitors.
[2264.22 --> 2267.22]  So don't worry too much about it if you're running at 1080p.
[2267.22 --> 2268.22]  Just get a 2 gig version.
[2268.22 --> 2274.22]  How safe is it to overclock a 660 Ti with GPU tweak?
[2274.22 --> 2275.22]  Safe?
[2275.22 --> 2276.22]  Yeah.
[2276.22 --> 2277.22]  Yeah.
[2277.22 --> 2278.22]  Yeah.
[2278.22 --> 2281.22]  If you start seeing artifacts, just back it on back down and, you know, don't go too
[2281.22 --> 2282.22]  crazy on the voltage.
[2282.22 --> 2285.22]  I know that NVIDIA GPUs you can't really...
[2285.22 --> 2286.22]  You can't really, yeah.
[2286.22 --> 2288.22]  Yeah, Project Greenlight I covered a long time ago.
[2288.22 --> 2294.22]  But basically it doesn't allow ASUS to allow you to set the voltages so high that it's just
[2294.22 --> 2297.22]  going to break the card.
[2297.22 --> 2299.22]  So be confident.
[2299.22 --> 2302.22]  Shoot, my friend was talking to me when you mentioned the giveaway.
[2302.22 --> 2306.22]  Chris, go watch the video that I actually just uploaded on the YouTube channel.
[2306.22 --> 2309.22]  How many times can we comment for giveaway?
[2309.22 --> 2312.22]  If you comment a bunch of times, I can tell you right now that, you know, you're not going
[2312.22 --> 2314.22]  to be disqualified necessarily.
[2314.22 --> 2319.22]  But if you win, we might sort of go back and see how many times you commented and make
[2319.22 --> 2322.22]  sure that it was, you know, you weren't just being a butthead about it.
[2322.22 --> 2324.22]  So there you go.
[2324.22 --> 2327.22]  Um, have you heard about the Joker 7870?
[2327.22 --> 2329.22]  No.
[2329.22 --> 2332.22]  Apparently performs near better than the 7950.
[2332.22 --> 2336.22]  You know, this is the case sometimes where you have lower end GPUs that are sort of have
[2336.22 --> 2340.22]  a custom PCB and they're overclocked balls to the walls to be competitive with a higher
[2340.22 --> 2341.22]  GPU.
[2341.22 --> 2347.22]  But something that I always want to remind people is that that higher end GPU has overclocking
[2347.22 --> 2348.22]  headroom too.
[2348.22 --> 2349.22]  Yeah.
[2349.22 --> 2353.22]  Like with the 660 Ti Power Edition before they green lighted it.
[2353.22 --> 2354.22]  Yeah.
[2354.22 --> 2355.22]  You could pretty much tie a 680.
[2355.22 --> 2357.22]  When they were both overclocked.
[2357.22 --> 2358.22]  Yeah.
[2358.22 --> 2363.22]  Now a 670 can overclock better than the 660 Ti.
[2363.22 --> 2364.22]  Yeah.
[2364.22 --> 2368.22]  So, yeah, something to, something to talk about.
[2368.22 --> 2371.22]  Uh, Linus, why didn't you talk about meeting Paul from Newegg?
[2371.22 --> 2372.22]  You know what?
[2372.22 --> 2375.22]  I met probably, I think I gave out around 400 business cards, which means I probably met
[2375.22 --> 2377.22]  around 400 people.
[2377.22 --> 2379.22]  Although Paul was one of the highlights.
[2379.22 --> 2386.22]  I actually ran into them at the Kingston, Kingston Gigabyte Intel Party.
[2386.22 --> 2391.22]  And, uh, they were just kind of there and I was, uh, I walked up and I think I probably
[2391.22 --> 2397.22]  made some comment about how I love and respect the work that they do and how the quality of their
[2397.22 --> 2401.22]  content just really is a, uh, is a blessing on the entire internet.
[2401.22 --> 2404.22]  And does that sound like something I would say to them?
[2404.22 --> 2406.22]  No, that doesn't sound like you at all.
[2406.22 --> 2407.22]  No, no.
[2407.22 --> 2410.22]  I think it was something along the lines of how far they are behind me and how they'll
[2410.22 --> 2412.22]  never catch up and how I respect them.
[2412.22 --> 2413.22]  Not at all.
[2413.22 --> 2414.22]  Just horrible, horrible things.
[2414.22 --> 2415.22]  Yeah.
[2415.22 --> 2416.22]  It was really good though.
[2416.22 --> 2417.22]  It was a total pleasure to meet them.
[2417.22 --> 2418.22]  I mean, it's all in good fun.
[2418.22 --> 2419.22]  I'm just teasing them.
[2419.22 --> 2422.22]  I know they take shots at me from time to time as well.
[2422.22 --> 2424.22]  Um, awesome, awesome guys.
[2424.22 --> 2430.22]  I'd say the thing that struck me most about Paul was the fact that when you talk to him
[2430.22 --> 2435.22]  in person and just kind of sat and shot the breeze with them about hardware, he sounds
[2435.22 --> 2440.22]  exactly the same as he does when he does a video.
[2440.22 --> 2444.22]  He's a very, uh, genuine, genuine YouTube personality.
[2444.22 --> 2448.22]  Whereas some people are actually not tech guys.
[2448.22 --> 2456.22]  They are actors who act about tech, which is, I mean, that's sounds stupid, but it's
[2456.22 --> 2463.22]  not the same thing at all as people who are actually genuinely excited about the technology.
[2463.22 --> 2467.22]  So I met Paul at the razor booth in the most random possible way ever.
[2467.22 --> 2468.22]  Did you see his video?
[2468.22 --> 2471.22]  Why don't you talk about that while I go check some more live stream topics.
[2471.22 --> 2472.22]  Okay.
[2472.22 --> 2473.22]  Okay.
[2473.22 --> 2476.22]  We're walking through the razor booth, uh, Diesel, Harrison, and I, uh, if you saw Harrison
[2476.22 --> 2481.22]  on the coverage, um, and I don't remember what we were doing there, like at all.
[2481.22 --> 2486.22]  Oh, I think we were trying to find the, uh, steam big picture booth, which wasn't like
[2486.22 --> 2487.22]  anywhere on the map.
[2487.22 --> 2489.22]  So we were trying to ask the razor guys cause we thought they might've known.
[2489.22 --> 2491.22]  I think that's what we were doing.
[2491.22 --> 2494.22]  Anyway, I'm walking around holding the camera and the bag and everything.
[2494.22 --> 2497.22]  And then all of a sudden I just hear slick.
[2497.22 --> 2499.22]  And I'm like, what?
[2499.22 --> 2503.22]  So I kind of look around and there's Paul and I was just like, this is so random.
[2503.22 --> 2505.22]  So it was really, really cool meeting him.
[2505.22 --> 2507.22]  He got to see who Diesel was.
[2507.22 --> 2509.22]  Um, he's a really nice guy.
[2509.22 --> 2513.22]  He made a video about like his coverage of CES.
[2513.22 --> 2515.22]  You should, what is his, Paul's Hardware?
[2515.22 --> 2517.22]  His YouTube channel is Paul's Hardware.
[2517.22 --> 2518.22]  You should go check it out.
[2518.22 --> 2519.22]  Really, really good video.
[2519.22 --> 2522.22]  Uh, one second.
[2522.22 --> 2529.22]  Oh, I changed to, there we go.
[2529.22 --> 2542.22]  So this is more of his personal channel, not his Newegg channel.
[2542.22 --> 2544.22]  Um, and this is the video that I was talking about.
[2544.22 --> 2547.22]  I'm not going to play it right now because I'm not sure about audio levels.
[2547.22 --> 2548.22]  I guess it's muted.
[2548.22 --> 2554.22]  But yeah, he basically just goes on and talks about, um, his experience at CES.
[2554.22 --> 2565.22]  Some of the stuff that he covered, um, and troubles he had the AMD bunker, as he calls it, which we didn't get to see, which was really, really cool.
[2565.22 --> 2572.22]  Um, which is basically this big kind of dark room, but with portrait TVs all the way around.
[2572.22 --> 2576.22]  And then this scene kind of just real life going around around it.
[2576.22 --> 2581.22]  So you can see like a cow and it'll walk from one TV to the other TV, but there's like a wall in between it.
[2581.22 --> 2585.22]  So it's properly timed when it comes out to the other one and the sound is all 360 degrees around.
[2585.22 --> 2586.22]  It's pretty cool.
[2586.22 --> 2589.22]  I'm not really sure what the application of it is, but it's pretty cool.
[2589.22 --> 2593.22]  I think the application is people who are allergic to the sun.
[2593.22 --> 2596.22]  So they just want to like experience the outside world.
[2596.22 --> 2598.22]  Without actually having windows in their homes.
[2598.22 --> 2600.22]  They can just put TVs where all the windows should go.
[2600.22 --> 2603.22]  That is actually kind of interesting.
[2603.22 --> 2606.22]  The smartest thing I've ever heard ever.
[2606.22 --> 2609.22]  No, really think about this for a minute.
[2609.22 --> 2612.22]  That's really interesting because you can have speakers in your walls and TVs in your walls.
[2612.22 --> 2614.22]  So it'll just always feel like you're outside.
[2614.22 --> 2615.22]  Yeah.
[2615.22 --> 2617.22]  Or if, uh, you know, like, okay.
[2617.22 --> 2618.22]  Okay.
[2618.22 --> 2619.22]  So, so we're, we're fine.
[2619.22 --> 2620.22]  Actually, this was a really cool thing.
[2620.22 --> 2622.22]  We saw the flexible OLED screens.
[2622.22 --> 2623.22]  That was really cool.
[2623.22 --> 2624.22]  That was cool.
[2624.22 --> 2626.22]  Cause they're like legit flexible.
[2626.22 --> 2629.22]  Like they just take the thing and they just kind of go like this and then the stuff keeps
[2629.22 --> 2630.22]  while it was playing.
[2630.22 --> 2631.22]  Yeah.
[2631.22 --> 2632.22]  While it was playing.
[2632.22 --> 2637.22]  So if they could make a, like, and you, oh, the transparent, uh, transparent screens.
[2637.22 --> 2643.22]  So if they could make a transparent screen that can be either opaque or transparent, then
[2643.22 --> 2650.22]  you could have either a window or a scene or something in between.
[2650.22 --> 2657.22]  So you could have like the outside with like bubbles coming up from time to time, which
[2657.22 --> 2659.22]  would actually be kind of ridiculous.
[2659.22 --> 2661.22]  That would be really cool.
[2661.22 --> 2663.22]  I mean, that might be coming 30, 50 years from now.
[2663.22 --> 2664.22]  Right.
[2664.22 --> 2666.22]  Where it's like no glasses 3D.
[2666.22 --> 2671.22]  So the bubbles actually have depth and it's just, you look outside and bubbles come up
[2671.22 --> 2672.22]  across the landscape.
[2672.22 --> 2673.22]  It reacts to your mood.
[2673.22 --> 2677.22]  So you get really angry and then all the windows are like, oh, yeah.
[2677.22 --> 2679.22]  And like, like lightning comes down.
[2679.22 --> 2681.22]  Well that again, okay.
[2681.22 --> 2685.22]  That brings us to the perceptual technology demo at Intel where they're talking about how
[2685.22 --> 2689.22]  they want to build sort of webcams and well, they want computers to be aware of you.
[2689.22 --> 2694.22]  So they'll have infrared sensors and, uh, you know, who knows what they'll have in the
[2694.22 --> 2695.22]  future.
[2695.22 --> 2699.22]  Maybe temperature sensors plus cameras, they'll be able to read facial expressions and they want
[2699.22 --> 2705.22]  the computer to know if you're reading something on Facebook and you like it, then it can just
[2705.22 --> 2706.22]  like it for you.
[2706.22 --> 2708.22]  And little random things.
[2708.22 --> 2713.22]  Like if you pick a movie and you've watched that movie, like similar movies before and you
[2713.22 --> 2717.22]  didn't look like you liked it, like the computer perceives that you did not like it.
[2717.22 --> 2719.22]  It'll be like, oh, I don't recommend this movie.
[2719.22 --> 2720.22]  You didn't like this type before.
[2720.22 --> 2721.22]  Yeah.
[2721.22 --> 2727.22]  So, so that brings us to our, you know, our 3D room sort of that, that would actually be
[2727.22 --> 2728.22]  kind of the coolest thing ever.
[2728.22 --> 2729.22]  We're getting close to holodeck.
[2729.22 --> 2730.22]  Yeah.
[2730.22 --> 2733.22]  We're getting close to like the pathetic fallacy actually being all around us.
[2733.22 --> 2735.22]  So that, that'd be like the best thing ever.
[2735.22 --> 2736.22]  I want a holodeck.
[2736.22 --> 2737.22]  You want a holodeck?
[2737.22 --> 2744.22]  I think you're, I think we're a little bit too, too old to actually survive to holodecks
[2744.22 --> 2750.22]  and like the singularity and like, you know, defeating aging and all that kind of stuff,
[2750.22 --> 2751.22]  which is very disappointing.
[2751.22 --> 2755.22]  We might be like one of the last generations of people who have to actually die.
[2755.22 --> 2760.22]  If you watch Ted, there's a scientist on there saying that defeating aging is like coming up.
[2760.22 --> 2761.22]  Coming pretty soon?
[2761.22 --> 2763.22]  Yeah, but it'll be probably too expensive for either you or I to afford it.
[2763.22 --> 2764.22]  Right, right.
[2764.22 --> 2768.22]  And then like a couple of years after we pass away, it'll be like, yeah, affordable.
[2768.22 --> 2772.22]  Or the worst thing ever would be because you're a little younger than me.
[2772.22 --> 2773.22]  Like I died.
[2773.22 --> 2781.22]  Curse you slick for out living me by that critical two years.
[2781.22 --> 2783.22]  Oh my goodness.
[2783.22 --> 2784.22]  So, yeah.
[2784.22 --> 2785.22]  I mean, what else?
[2785.22 --> 2789.22]  I mean, we could almost talk about CES all night tonight, probably.
[2789.22 --> 2790.22]  What else was like?
[2790.22 --> 2792.22]  Do we want to dip into Twitter comments again?
[2792.22 --> 2793.22]  Yeah, okay.
[2793.22 --> 2794.22]  And then we can jump back into CES.
[2794.22 --> 2795.22]  Why don't we go have a look at some Twitter comments?
[2795.22 --> 2796.22]  That's a good idea.
[2796.22 --> 2797.22]  Whoops.
[2797.22 --> 2799.22]  You have good ideas from time to time.
[2799.22 --> 2800.22]  Like always.
[2800.22 --> 2806.22]  Okay, so we did talk about meeting Paul now, which is awesome.
[2806.22 --> 2808.22]  First time watching live.
[2808.22 --> 2809.22]  Thank you.
[2809.22 --> 2810.22]  CES coverage was awesome.
[2810.22 --> 2811.22]  Thank you.
[2811.22 --> 2814.22]  Ah, ah, Asus.
[2814.22 --> 2817.22]  Ah, waiting for Intel's new blah, blah, blah.
[2817.22 --> 2819.22]  Should I get the 3770k?
[2819.22 --> 2820.22]  You know what?
[2820.22 --> 2822.22]  There was a, oh, I don't think we ever talked about this.
[2822.22 --> 2823.22]  The Reddit AMA.
[2823.22 --> 2825.22]  Yeah, the Reddit AMA.
[2825.22 --> 2832.22]  I don't remember the link, but if you search for Intel Engineer AMA, it was freaking awesome.
[2832.22 --> 2835.22]  Like he talked about so much cool stuff.
[2835.22 --> 2841.22]  I mean, obviously he's, you know, bound by non-disclosure agreements as well, so he can't give details.
[2841.22 --> 2844.22]  But he did let slip a couple of gems.
[2844.22 --> 2846.22]  Now, you and I have talked about this already.
[2846.22 --> 2847.22]  Haswell's coming.
[2847.22 --> 2854.22]  The next generation Intel platform and socket and CPU architecture on socket 1150.
[2854.22 --> 2856.22]  So Haswell's coming.
[2856.22 --> 2859.22]  And we kind of looked at the specs and we were like, oh.
[2859.22 --> 2860.22]  Boring.
[2860.22 --> 2862.22]  Same clock speeds.
[2862.22 --> 2867.22]  There's gonna be like a K series with hyper threading and a K series without hyper threading.
[2867.22 --> 2869.22]  And then some non-K.
[2869.22 --> 2870.22]  That we don't care about.
[2870.22 --> 2871.22]  Like, okay.
[2871.22 --> 2873.22]  I'll just stick with my things as non-K.
[2873.22 --> 2890.22]  And then after all the song and dance that Intel went through about how the reason that Ivy Bridge didn't overclock well, I mean, generationally better than Sandy Bridge was because as the dyes keep shrinking, we're reaching that point of we can't crank it up anymore.
[2890.22 --> 2892.22]  We can't just pump more bolts through it.
[2892.22 --> 2893.22]  Heat's gonna become a factor for us.
[2893.22 --> 2894.22]  Like, quick fast.
[2894.22 --> 2898.22]  So we were kind of looking at it going, okay, well there's probably nothing special overclocking-wise.
[2898.22 --> 2903.22]  That was around the time those rumors were coming out that Intel was going to do away with sockets entirely.
[2903.22 --> 2907.22]  So we were like, okay, they don't care about enthusiasts anymore, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2907.22 --> 2908.22]  No!
[2908.22 --> 2912.22]  Read the AMA because he drops a couple bomb hints.
[2912.22 --> 2918.22]  Like, we'll be, like the best thing ever, basically gonna be the bee's knees for-
[2918.22 --> 2921.22]  He said it'll be an overclocker's dream.
[2921.22 --> 2923.22]  An overclocker's dream, he calls it.
[2923.22 --> 2927.22]  Which is, like, I'm excited.
[2927.22 --> 2934.22]  I don't want to get too excited because of the overclocking ability of Ivy was just kind of depressing.
[2934.22 --> 2939.22]  The thing that disappoints me is that we're not gonna get a 2011 refresh, like, right away.
[2939.22 --> 2943.22]  Like, why do I have to wait for my truly high-end platform?
[2943.22 --> 2948.22]  Mind you, I'm gonna have Ivy Bridge E by then, which will be like 10 cores or something, so I'll probably be alright.
[2948.22 --> 2953.22]  But anyway, really excited for Haswell, don't remember where we were going with that.
[2953.22 --> 2958.22]  However, do I think a 3770K is gonna be outdated anytime soon?
[2958.22 --> 2959.22]  No.
[2959.22 --> 2960.22]  No, I really don't think so.
[2960.22 --> 2968.22]  I mean, go back- we had to go back pretty far to find a test platform that had a CPU that was slow enough that it sucked.
[2968.22 --> 2972.22]  I mean, even right after that, we got LGA1366.
[2972.22 --> 2976.22]  Bloomfield 920s are, like, still kicking.
[2976.22 --> 2977.22]  My dad's running one.
[2977.22 --> 2978.22]  Yeah.
[2978.22 --> 2979.22]  And, like, running it well.
[2979.22 --> 2981.22]  He folds on it constantly.
[2981.22 --> 2983.22]  Well, he uses, uh, Boink?
[2983.22 --> 2984.22]  Yeah.
[2984.22 --> 2985.22]  Yeah, he uses Boink.
[2985.22 --> 2986.22]  He can still run any game.
[2986.22 --> 2990.22]  And while running Boink, he plays whatever he wants.
[2990.22 --> 2991.22]  Yeah.
[2991.22 --> 2995.22]  So, I mean, that, that, that architecture was so strong.
[2995.22 --> 2998.22]  And we have, we've seen small generational improvements from then.
[2998.22 --> 2999.22]  But think about it this way.
[2999.22 --> 3001.22]  We haven't actually seen that many.
[3001.22 --> 3004.22]  Cause Bloomfield to Linfield was just a socket change.
[3004.22 --> 3006.22]  It was the exact same architecture.
[3006.22 --> 3011.22]  And then from there we went to, uh, we only got Linfield on 1156, right?
[3011.22 --> 3012.22]  I think so, yeah.
[3012.22 --> 3015.22]  And then from there we went to Sandy Bridge.
[3015.22 --> 3017.22]  Yeah, from there we went to Sandy Bridge.
[3017.22 --> 3019.22]  So we got a generational bump there.
[3019.22 --> 3024.22]  And then we got Sandy Bridge E, which was just that again, but on a different socket.
[3024.22 --> 3031.22]  And then we got Ivy Bridge, which, corporate, instructions per clock actually didn't change that much from Sandy Bridge.
[3031.22 --> 3037.22]  So since Bloomfield, we've actually only probably increased clock for clock around 20 to 30%.
[3037.22 --> 3040.22]  And clock speeds really haven't gone up that much.
[3040.22 --> 3043.22]  You can overclock a Bloomfield CPU to 3.6, 3.8 easy.
[3043.22 --> 3046.22]  So, yeah, think about that, guys.
[3046.22 --> 3050.22]  Um, and I broke Lou Twitter.
[3050.22 --> 3052.22]  Oh, sorry, I promised I was done with the Frangway.
[3052.22 --> 3055.22]  Uh, let's go ahead and...
[3055.22 --> 3058.22]  When is the Windows 8 giveaway gonna happen?
[3058.22 --> 3059.22]  Uh, you know what?
[3059.22 --> 3061.22]  Probably near the end of the stream.
[3061.22 --> 3062.22]  So Windows 8 giveaway will come.
[3062.22 --> 3063.22]  Be patient.
[3063.22 --> 3067.22]  Uh, will there be an unboxing of those two water coolers?
[3067.22 --> 3070.22]  Yes, they are in the mail already.
[3070.22 --> 3073.22]  What's your opinion on computers in the future?
[3073.22 --> 3077.22]  My opinion on computers in the future is that they will be futuristic.
[3077.22 --> 3079.22]  They are futuristic.
[3079.22 --> 3082.22]  Cause I have to ask, you know, honestly, I don't know, man.
[3082.22 --> 3083.22]  Let's have a look.
[3083.22 --> 3084.22]  Let's let, or not let's have a look.
[3084.22 --> 3085.22]  Let's see what happens.
[3085.22 --> 3087.22]  Just saw your picture of the dog in the car.
[3087.22 --> 3089.22]  Yeah, that was actually very sad.
[3089.22 --> 3091.22]  I don't know if I want to talk about that right now.
[3091.22 --> 3093.22]  Um, really?
[3093.22 --> 3096.22]  It's just like, is nobody tweeting tonight?
[3096.22 --> 3100.22]  I haven't seen, I've seen one, one comment about the contest and it's just cause the guy didn't hear it.
[3100.22 --> 3101.22]  No, here's one.
[3101.22 --> 3103.22]  And the CES cover was killing, oh no wait, no it's not.
[3103.22 --> 3104.22]  Oh, nice giveaway.
[3104.22 --> 3105.22]  Hope I win.
[3105.22 --> 3106.22]  There we go.
[3106.22 --> 3107.22]  There we go.
[3107.22 --> 3108.22]  How did you find it?
[3108.22 --> 3109.22]  Hmm?
[3109.22 --> 3110.22]  CrackinX40 video.
[3110.22 --> 3113.22]  He's gonna get it.
[3113.22 --> 3115.22]  It's here.
[3115.22 --> 3117.22]  I will work on it soon.
[3117.22 --> 3118.22]  We've been very busy.
[3118.22 --> 3122.22]  We've had some very exciting stuff going on.
[3122.22 --> 3125.22]  Um, hopefully we'll be able to talk about it a little bit more.
[3125.22 --> 3130.22]  For those of you who don't know already, if you're just tuning in, we have a forum now.
[3130.22 --> 3132.22]  So, linustechtips.com.
[3132.22 --> 3133.22]  Go there, sign up.
[3133.22 --> 3135.22]  There's an error when you register.
[3135.22 --> 3136.22]  Don't worry.
[3136.22 --> 3138.22]  Your account has been created.
[3138.22 --> 3140.22]  You can start posting immediately.
[3140.22 --> 3142.22]  It usually works now.
[3142.22 --> 3143.22]  Oh, it usually works.
[3143.22 --> 3144.22]  Usually works.
[3144.22 --> 3145.22]  Oh, it doesn't, there's no error?
[3145.22 --> 3146.22]  No.
[3146.22 --> 3147.22]  No.
[3147.22 --> 3148.22]  Oh, okay.
[3148.22 --> 3149.22]  We rolled out a new beta of VBulletin 5.
[3149.22 --> 3150.22]  By we, I mean you.
[3150.22 --> 3151.22]  Not me.
[3151.22 --> 3152.22]  And Mr. Wizard.
[3152.22 --> 3153.22]  And Mr. Wizard.
[3153.22 --> 3154.22]  Yeah.
[3154.22 --> 3155.22]  It might still mess up.
[3155.22 --> 3156.22]  No guarantees.
[3156.22 --> 3160.22]  But, as far as I've seen, I made a couple of trash accounts and then deleted them.
[3160.22 --> 3161.22]  But, it worked every time.
[3161.22 --> 3162.22]  So, I don't know.
[3162.22 --> 3164.22]  If someone else gets the error, you might get the error.
[3164.22 --> 3165.22]  I don't know.
[3165.22 --> 3167.22]  But, on my test case so far, it seems to be working.
[3167.22 --> 3173.22]  But, guys, we're looking at a forum that is growing extremely quickly.
[3173.22 --> 3177.22]  We're pleased beyond our wildest dreams at how well it's doing.
[3177.22 --> 3179.22]  How much people are enjoying it.
[3179.22 --> 3183.22]  It's just a great place for everyone to kind of come and interact.
[3183.22 --> 3186.22]  We're probably going to make some changes over time.
[3186.22 --> 3189.22]  Adding things like, I want you guys to watch.
[3189.22 --> 3193.22]  I want to have our own sort of live stream with maybe like an up and down voting system
[3193.22 --> 3198.22]  for people to ask questions and then sort of vote up the questions that they think are most important
[3198.22 --> 3200.22]  so we can interact more during live streams.
[3200.22 --> 3202.22]  So, I'd like to build a module like that at some point.
[3202.22 --> 3209.22]  I'm trying to also post little written articles to go along with the videos that I'm posting every night.
[3209.22 --> 3212.22]  And, I'm posting those in the Linus Tech Tips video section.
[3212.22 --> 3213.22]  So, you can get a little bit of...
[3213.22 --> 3219.22]  Sometimes, I'll talk about sort of more general opinion about the product and how it fits into the marketplace.
[3219.22 --> 3225.22]  And, I'll also talk about things like, you know, funny things that happened behind the scenes while we were filming it.
[3225.22 --> 3229.22]  Or, anything like that that might be interesting.
[3229.22 --> 3232.22]  So, that's good.
[3232.22 --> 3236.22]  Last night, well I guess at 5am PST was when you guys would have seen it.
[3236.22 --> 3240.22]  But, all of last night, Mr. Wizard and I were working on the forum.
[3240.22 --> 3242.22]  We did a whole bunch of stuff.
[3242.22 --> 3247.22]  The majority of it was making sure that Beta 25 from VBulletin rolled out properly.
[3247.22 --> 3251.22]  But, we also, we moved the operating system and software out of hardware.
[3251.22 --> 3253.22]  It was just kind of there because it was kind of an oddball.
[3253.22 --> 3257.22]  So, we moved that under a software heading and we added a programming forum.
[3257.22 --> 3259.22]  A lot of people asked for a programming forum.
[3259.22 --> 3260.22]  That's weird.
[3260.22 --> 3264.22]  We weren't going to have it at first because we're like a hardware show.
[3264.22 --> 3265.22]  Yeah.
[3265.22 --> 3269.22]  But, a lot of our fans come from a lot of different disciplines and a lot of people asked for a programming forum.
[3269.22 --> 3271.22]  So, I decided no.
[3271.22 --> 3272.22]  Did you decide that?
[3272.22 --> 3273.22]  I decided that.
[3273.22 --> 3275.22]  I wasn't informed that he had decided that, but okay.
[3275.22 --> 3278.22]  I decided we have a programming forum now.
[3278.22 --> 3282.22]  I've seen a couple posts in there, but I think it's mainly because people didn't know it was there.
[3282.22 --> 3285.22]  So, if you're into programming, you want to talk about programming, jump on the programming forum.
[3285.22 --> 3288.22]  Make it active so Linus doesn't want to remove it.
[3288.22 --> 3290.22]  No, no.
[3290.22 --> 3291.22]  It's not that I wanted to remove it.
[3291.22 --> 3294.22]  I just didn't expect anyone to be that interested in it.
[3294.22 --> 3298.22]  Then again, programming is not really my thing, so.
[3298.22 --> 3300.22]  To put it mildly.
[3300.22 --> 3302.22]  Ah, KrakenX40.
[3302.22 --> 3307.22]  How did you find out, find, how did you find about the Turtle Beach headsets?
[3307.22 --> 3309.22]  I was probably wondering what you thought about them in general.
[3309.22 --> 3312.22]  Oh, I didn't really get to listen to them much while we were there.
[3312.22 --> 3323.22]  So, unfortunately, I'll have to wait until we actually get something that we can bring hands-on on the set and listen to for more of an extended period of time and to really evaluate.
[3323.22 --> 3327.22]  What about the eSports chick that had a thing for me?
[3327.22 --> 3330.22]  I watched that video and I don't know where all of this came from.
[3330.22 --> 3331.22]  She's bubbly.
[3331.22 --> 3333.22]  I don't necessarily think she had a thing for me.
[3333.22 --> 3334.22]  She's bubbly.
[3334.22 --> 3335.22]  Yeah.
[3335.22 --> 3339.22]  I mean, her thing is she's there like repping Thermaltake eSports.
[3339.22 --> 3343.22]  It's like her job to be excited about like gaming peripherals.
[3343.22 --> 3347.22]  Speaking of being excited about gaming peripherals, Cherry MX Greens.
[3347.22 --> 3349.22]  Oh my goodness, they're awesome.
[3349.22 --> 3351.22]  They're so cool.
[3351.22 --> 3357.22]  I'm kind of a keyboard fanatic as some people may have figured out and I'm a huge fan of blues.
[3357.22 --> 3359.22]  I've never been able to type on greens yet.
[3359.22 --> 3366.22]  So when we got there and they're like, oh yeah, blah, blah, blah, talking about all their keyboards and then they get over to the other side and they're like, oh yeah, and we decided we'd roll out a keyboard with greens.
[3366.22 --> 3369.22]  I was like, holy crap, yes, this is awesome.
[3369.22 --> 3372.22]  So I finally got to go up and type on it because I've only ever seen them in space bars.
[3372.22 --> 3378.22]  They're basically stiff blues and the sound of them is kind of deeper.
[3378.22 --> 3381.22]  It doesn't have so much of a sharp edge to it.
[3381.22 --> 3383.22]  It's just kind of, it's more chunky and they weigh more.
[3383.22 --> 3389.22]  So it's, if you have big meat hands and you just like smash your keys, it's really, really, really nice.
[3389.22 --> 3391.22]  I've seen a couple of people posting, why would anyone ever like that?
[3391.22 --> 3392.22]  They weigh so much.
[3392.22 --> 3393.22]  It's awesome.
[3393.22 --> 3394.22]  That's exactly what I want.
[3394.22 --> 3396.22]  I love greens.
[3396.22 --> 3398.22]  I hope to get my hands on a green keyboard pretty soon.
[3398.22 --> 3399.22]  That was really cool.
[3399.22 --> 3401.22]  I actually completely forgot about that.
[3401.22 --> 3402.22]  I know there was so much.
[3402.22 --> 3404.22]  There's way too much stuff.
[3404.22 --> 3405.22]  That was Cooler Master, not Thermaltake.
[3405.22 --> 3407.22]  Sorry, I kind of changed gears there.
[3407.22 --> 3408.22]  Yeah.
[3408.22 --> 3409.22]  Yeah.
[3409.22 --> 3411.22]  Cooler Master is going to be bringing that to market soon.
[3411.22 --> 3414.22]  I think the allocation of them will be quite limited.
[3414.22 --> 3415.22]  Yeah.
[3415.22 --> 3419.22]  So there's not going to be a ton available, but someone's finally doing it.
[3419.22 --> 3422.22]  It's not necessarily Cooler Master's fault.
[3422.22 --> 3423.22]  Yeah.
[3423.22 --> 3428.22]  The switches are not that common because they're usually only used in space bars and then even then they're not used that much.
[3428.22 --> 3429.22]  And they're expensive.
[3429.22 --> 3430.22]  They're expensive.
[3430.22 --> 3431.22]  So that's why they don't tend to get implemented.
[3431.22 --> 3434.22]  Who was it who said they were going to bring a Topra keyboard?
[3434.22 --> 3436.22]  I think that was also Cooler Master.
[3436.22 --> 3439.22]  I mean, those guys are going absolutely like...
[3439.22 --> 3441.22]  Their product line has just exploded.
[3441.22 --> 3442.22]  Yeah.
[3442.22 --> 3443.22]  It's ridiculous.
[3443.22 --> 3452.22]  Like keyboard wise, they're going up against guys like Ducky and Philco and they are like serious about having a broad portfolio of keyboards.
[3452.22 --> 3454.22]  And they make like... they're solid keyboards.
[3454.22 --> 3455.22]  Yeah.
[3455.22 --> 3456.22]  They feel nice.
[3456.22 --> 3457.22]  They feel good.
[3457.22 --> 3458.22]  Yeah.
[3458.22 --> 3462.22]  I have my Ducky but there's a really sad story to go along with that which I can explain in a second.
[3462.22 --> 3466.60]  but currently I'm using a quick fire quick fire with blue switches okay the
[3466.60 --> 3473.44]  ducky story as some of you might know I go get it I'm gonna go get the ducky I'm
[3473.44 --> 3480.76]  sorry okay as some of you might know I have my ducky I'm a big fan of my ducky
[3480.76 --> 3484.56]  I took it down to PAX got it signed by a whole bunch of people so that when he
[3484.56 --> 3489.28]  comes down here I used to run my mineral oil computer one of the weird things
[3489.28 --> 3491.80]  that you figure out with mineral oil computer after running one for five
[3491.80 --> 3494.44]  years it's different if you just build one run it for a couple months and get
[3494.44 --> 3498.50]  rid of it I ran it for five years there's a lot of stuff that happens after the
[3498.50 --> 3502.46]  like year year and a half mark that is just bizarre one thing that starts
[3502.46 --> 3507.22]  happening is as a mineral oil heats up now I had it pumped out to a radiator so it
[3507.22 --> 3510.40]  was being cooled down all the time it's not a passive mineral oil rig which I'm
[3510.40 --> 3515.66]  not a fan of it was a active cooled mineral oil rig as a mineral oil heats up
[3515.66 --> 3519.48]  so if I play a really intense game that it would climb out of my case now I had a
[3519.48 --> 3522.60]  plexiglass shield but it would still climb out of my case and get up on my
[3522.60 --> 3526.92]  cables and climb up my cables it was ridiculous so it would come down and
[3526.92 --> 3530.10]  like not a ton of it but it would come down and it would get on the plastic of
[3530.10 --> 3539.04]  the cables and harden all of them now as it would harden my cables and then as I
[3539.04 --> 3543.30]  move my cables around they'd if I was if I manhandled them a little bit they'd crack
[3543.30 --> 3549.06]  now this is you can detach the USB cable on it so I'd take it around all the time
[3549.06 --> 3552.36]  because I really really like my keyboard and stash my USB cable my bag so it
[3552.36 --> 3557.94]  started cracking over time and then the keyboard stopped working I thought this
[3557.94 --> 3563.06]  was because the cable so I swapped it with the detachable cable on my quickfire
[3563.06 --> 3574.22]  a wild keyboard appears it fainted and it stopped working so I've been kind of scared to fully
[3574.22 --> 3579.56]  diagnose it yet because I'm really worried that it's dead because I really like this keyboard but
[3579.56 --> 3585.20]  I'll have to figure it out in the next day or two I guess who are all these signatures on the back look
[3585.20 --> 3590.30]  at that it's even signed by people I know who husky is how's he you know who us he is yeah yeah only
[3590.30 --> 3601.28]  because you talk about it him there's bomber noni bling fire zerg husky day nines mom day
[3601.28 --> 3609.38]  nines mom day nine and in control it's all starcraft people yeah do you even play
[3609.38 --> 3614.72]  starcraft I do I don't have any time to play because you work me like a slave but I do
[3614.72 --> 3624.68]  play starcraft oh okay well that got awkward real fast my brother is better at starcraft than me
[3624.68 --> 3631.88]  and a caster you should check him out on Twitter it's at cold sc he's pretty great has good starcraft
[3631.88 --> 3636.92]  content look at that you have an overclocked.net spacebar too I do my spacebar is overclocked.net
[3636.92 --> 3643.32]  this is a day nine well yeah this is an overclocked.net spacebar it's ninja printing so it's there and
[3643.32 --> 3650.40]  it has ducky logo on it this is day nines nine key I got that from packs these ones come with the
[3650.40 --> 3657.18]  keyboard all the white ones is like it's kind of a funny story actually the white ones yeah it's a my
[3657.18 --> 3665.76]  brother bought a full key set of blank whites from WASD for Christmas and gave me half and then used half
[3665.76 --> 3670.92]  on his board so I like grabbed the remainders and like kind of made things work this is my favorite part
[3670.92 --> 3675.24]  all white arrow keys because I never use them it looks really cool and then this is a team liquid
[3675.24 --> 3685.50]  key that I put on my escape same as the sweater it painted wah wah stop it's okay we're gonna fix it
[3685.50 --> 3693.40]  I don't know how but I will fix it I will make it live so that was that's a sad story I have no idea
[3693.40 --> 3699.46]  how we got there but that's a sad story okay probably the probably the best story of today
[3699.46 --> 3707.44]  has to be the so wait did you did you say actually you know what here let's talk about this so guys as
[3707.44 --> 3718.84]  you know I've been an iOS user for over two years now oh almost two and a half years so my trademark iPhone
[3718.84 --> 3725.26]  comparisons for size may actually be going away you should just keep it as a brick to use should I
[3725.26 --> 3731.84]  just keep it as like keep it as a size comparison brick mp3 player and no just a brick so I can't even
[3731.84 --> 3735.84]  use it to listen to music no so I just have to not use it you can just listen to music on your new
[3735.84 --> 3745.60]  phone what if this is better no probably won't be okay so my iOS days are numbered I'm actually kind of
[3745.60 --> 3751.60]  like like I received these in the mail two days ago but I'm sort of like I'm not even sure if I want
[3751.60 --> 3758.56]  to open them because they mean that I will have to move away from the familiarity of my Apple universe
[3758.56 --> 3769.48]  to something new so I recently got in touch with HTC I've never actually had any access to like cool new
[3769.48 --> 3775.54]  phones or anything like that but they basically said well here you're an iOS user that's a very sad
[3775.54 --> 3781.54]  thing you have a lot of people who follow you on sort of that thing on the internet with the videos
[3781.54 --> 3790.60]  the YouTube so tell you what no strings attached why don't you try another platform so they sent over
[3790.60 --> 3796.54]  a couple cool phones one of them is the HTC 8x which is a Windows 8 phone which I'm extremely excited
[3796.54 --> 3805.54]  about and the other one is the is it the one it's the one plus the one plus which is a 1080p Android phone
[3805.54 --> 3809.54]  I actually had a few people telling me I went with the wrong one and because they had given me the option
[3809.54 --> 3816.54]  between the one plus and the the 720p other more different really I just like the screen on the one
[3816.54 --> 3824.54]  yeah so I wanted to try I wanted to see what a 1080p screen looks like on a phone so these are the care packages that came along with them so I figure I'll do like a live unboxing of whatever the heck is in
[3824.54 --> 3831.54]  here green paper okay
[3831.54 --> 3854.52]  more green paper no there's something in there okay so here it's like you can hold that so inside this box we have an HTC car stereo clip which quick and easy to set up play music from your phone through your car stereo speakers delivers authentic studio quality sounds and
[3854.52 --> 3861.52]  through aptX enhancement Bluetooth supporting to use this product please ensure your stereo is equipped with a three and a half millimeter auxiliary and connector
[3861.52 --> 3868.52]  so it's three and a half millimeter to Bluetooth you can Bluetooth your phone to it that is actually the best thing ever because I use I you know what I wish I could take the camera out to my car right now because you can vouch for this I legit have a three and a half mil connector always sticking out of my deck and then the other car in my wife's car the three and a half mil connectors in the glove box so there's always a three and a half mil connector just randomly sticking out through the glove box and then just like on the floor so this might
[3868.52 --> 3878.00]  actually be a better solution to that and I agree so this might be a better solution for watching this game I worry actually
[3878.04 --> 3883.52]  now that I think it's about 10 minutes but enough information to make your phone and then there's something about the phone in your car so that's going to be memositioning that reuse that's going to be
[3883.52 --> 3888.32]  glove box so there's always a three and a half mil connector just randomly sticking out through the
[3888.32 --> 3893.76]  glove box and then just like on the floor so this might actually be a better solution to that okay
[3893.76 --> 3900.48]  so cool stuff from HTC number one cool stuff from HTC number two is the media link everything on
[3900.48 --> 3904.48]  your phone to your TV in high definition instantly wireless I didn't even know they make accessories
[3904.48 --> 3909.36]  like this see this is how this is how sheltered I am I thought Apple TV was the only solution
[3909.36 --> 3916.64]  you horrible person well I don't have you saw the cube I don't have an Apple TV can't you do that with cube?
[3916.64 --> 3921.84]  I don't know uh simple intuitive swipe your screen with three fingers to instantly set up and share
[3921.84 --> 3927.20]  your content to your HD screen something something something uh so basically it's like wide eye
[3927.20 --> 3932.40]  supports up to 1080p video and audio DLNA compliant okay very cool what else is in there
[3932.40 --> 3939.68]  okay so obviously I'll be showing you guys a bunch of cool HTC stuff over the next little bit
[3939.68 --> 3946.72]  because this is all super exciting and whatnot okay on the go charging okay so it's a 6000 milliamp hour
[3946.72 --> 3951.44]  sort of on the go power brick I think we've all seen these before is it that slim two times full
[3951.44 --> 3956.00]  charged uh no I don't think it's that slim but when we do it we'll do an unboxing of it and then we'll
[3956.00 --> 3960.48]  we'll check it out or maybe we'll do like an unboxing of like all the HTC accessories because
[3960.48 --> 3965.04]  apparently there are all of them here uh crystal clear wire free music and phone calls so this is
[3965.04 --> 3971.84]  a wireless uh headphone and sort of microphone thing using bluetooth aptx with HTC exclusive audio
[3971.84 --> 3978.40]  profile for authentic sound okay I my expectations are not you know super high for headphones that come
[3978.40 --> 3985.68]  from non audio companies but I'll give them a try cost nothing to try and then it costs nothing for
[3985.68 --> 3990.40]  you guys to hear my thoughts about it so the risk is very low for you another on the go charger
[3991.04 --> 3997.04]  a black version of the wireless headphones okay and dun dun dun
[4002.32 --> 4011.84]  okay so there's card so this is the HTC 8x running windows phone 8 uh this is the yellow version which
[4011.84 --> 4019.36]  is apparently not actually available in my region so LTE is not going to work on this one okay um but from
[4019.36 --> 4024.48]  talking to them they were saying that the actual real world difference between LTE and like fast
[4024.48 --> 4030.64]  good 3g is not that big when you're actually running on the phone when you're tethering it might be
[4030.64 --> 4038.56]  noticeable okay but um yeah they were saying it's not as big of a deal in that way so okay it's a 16 gig
[4038.56 --> 4044.00]  version has a gig of ram 720p screen beats audio built in well that'll definitely be better than the
[4044.00 --> 4049.92]  iPhone actually i'm kind of curious to know if that is necessarily better than the iPhone so
[4049.92 --> 4055.36]  every beats audio is HTC now it's no longer uh monster oh that's right yeah i was wondering for
[4055.36 --> 4060.24]  a second i was like how did they work that out but there you go this comes in a much larger box
[4060.24 --> 4065.28]  that's the 1080p screen one yeah so i think it's got like a five inch screen or something yeah
[4065.28 --> 4070.64]  something ridiculous ridiculous like that so there's the droid dna thing on it wait a minute
[4070.64 --> 4076.48]  is this the uh is the droid dna the one with the 1080p screen maybe the 1x was the one without the 10 see
[4076.48 --> 4082.64]  i'm not actually a phone guy so i'm actually hoping to do a series of videos focused mostly on windows
[4082.64 --> 4090.00]  phone 8 where i go okay this is what it's like like maybe like a weekly blog sort of you know that would be
[4090.00 --> 4099.12]  cool day three i'm going through withdrawal my air video app where is it where is it um so so i'm i
[4099.12 --> 4104.80]  want to do sort of a what is the experience actually like going from ios to something else so we can
[4104.80 --> 4112.00]  enable others to take this to make the switch with me um hearing aid compatibility this one has like
[4112.00 --> 4115.84]  nothing about the phone whatsoever on the outside we're gonna have to give you like a face guard so
[4115.84 --> 4119.76]  you can't bite people when you go grab it so this one's a verizon phone so this is a us
[4119.76 --> 4124.24]  phone but apparently these are both fully unlocked so i can use them on bell which is uh my carrier
[4124.24 --> 4127.84]  although i'm not sure how long i'm gonna stick with them because they were kind of buttheads about
[4127.84 --> 4134.08]  my uh my last experience with them but how long did that take you oh i was on the phone with them
[4134.08 --> 4139.60]  basically for an entire day yeah i was trying to contact him that day it was just completely useless
[4139.60 --> 4144.16]  you know the stupid thing is rogers never really did wrong i was with rogers for like four years
[4144.16 --> 4148.40]  four four or five years rogers never did wrong by me they never did anything bad to me
[4148.40 --> 4155.44]  just bell had an offer and rogers wouldn't match it and my then girlfriend now wife was on bell so
[4155.44 --> 4159.84]  uh there was a bell the bell hat they had bell the bell that's right and i think rogers didn't have
[4159.84 --> 4164.88]  something equivalent and my contract was up and hers wasn't so i would consider going back to rogers i'd
[4164.88 --> 4171.12]  never i'd never use one of the other guys who i will not name but wouldn't even consider that so this
[4171.12 --> 4177.12]  is the verizon that looks really nice um how's the that's a nice soft touch on the back wow that's
[4177.12 --> 4181.68]  gorgeous so there you go guys we'll be doing unboxings of these over the next little bit i'm
[4181.68 --> 4187.52]  extremely excited to try them out i've as you guys know i've never really been a phone guy so i guess
[4187.52 --> 4192.48]  i'll have to like learn something new it's interesting i think it'll be fun okay to start trying out the
[4192.48 --> 4198.00]  phones and stuff and like if once we get more into phones i run a lot of kind of interesting fun apps on
[4198.00 --> 4203.20]  my phone would be cool to do like app stuff oh yeah they're all android yeah you know it's funny
[4203.20 --> 4208.16]  because my favorite app in the world is air video and i still haven't managed to do a tech tips video
[4208.16 --> 4214.96]  about it i talk about it i love air video it's amazing but i've never never done uh anything we
[4214.96 --> 4220.80]  should run a poll on the forums under your lannis's ramblings thing and figure out how many people want
[4220.80 --> 4226.24]  phone stuff yeah actually that's not a bad idea in fact um you know what i'd love to see your twitter
[4226.24 --> 4232.96]  comments right now about what you want us to talk about in terms of phones because it's new territory
[4232.96 --> 4238.72]  and we're not really sure what you guys are expecting i mean do you want more like uh bloggy
[4238.72 --> 4244.56]  style content like what it's like from a non phone guy's perspective or do you want us to more like
[4244.56 --> 4250.24]  sort of do a bunch of preparation and then just show you kind of neat stuff about them in the way that
[4250.24 --> 4255.20]  we normally do with computers where it comes very easily for me because almost everything i tell you
[4255.20 --> 4260.40]  guys about computers is just because i was actually driven to figure it out at some point because i
[4260.40 --> 4265.92]  actually had to and then now i just kind of know that um whereas with phones i've always taken the
[4265.92 --> 4272.08]  approach that uh if i can find the numbers and then hold it up here and sort of it makes a noise
[4272.08 --> 4276.64]  doesn't sort of you know then it's fine whereas he's more of a phone dork not not me
[4276.64 --> 4285.84]  um so yeah that's kind of neat uh what else do we have do do do do do highlights of cds i mean we
[4285.84 --> 4295.52]  can just talk about more more random cds stuff uh should we bring up the coffee story yes absolutely
[4295.52 --> 4301.36]  the coffee story is amazing i hope diesel's still watching this was one of the best like okay we're
[4301.36 --> 4307.76]  definitely in las vegas stories that we have um diesel this is like the first night or the second
[4307.76 --> 4313.92]  night or something um diesel and i are in the hotel room and diesel's starting to edit i'm trying to
[4313.92 --> 4320.72]  jump on my laptop and work on the forum and he's like man i need coffee tired need coffee so me and him
[4320.72 --> 4326.64]  go to leave go downstairs and the coffee shop that's in there serves like this tiny little cup of coffee
[4326.64 --> 4331.28]  for five bucks so we're like okay we need to find a starbucks so he can get a big freaking thing of
[4331.28 --> 4335.92]  coffee and just edit like a machine and that was on like day one to give you guys some idea how bad it
[4335.92 --> 4341.12]  was just from like traveling and like doing one day like we it was already brutal we were down there for
[4341.12 --> 4347.12]  what like six days yeah yeah so we're basically going on a hunt at this point we go out the front of
[4347.12 --> 4353.44]  the hotel and i ask one of the valets i'm like hey where can we get some coffee so the guy calls his buddy
[4353.44 --> 4360.16]  over and his buddy starts walking over diesel and i look over at his buddy and as his buddy walks up he goes
[4361.76 --> 4367.92]  like very noticeably and i'm just thinking okay stuffy nose look back at the valet that i asked and
[4367.92 --> 4373.68]  he's like no no no no i actually think they're talking about coffee he thought we were wanting to buy
[4373.68 --> 4381.28]  cocaine i was like wow we're definitely in vegas and it turned out that all the coffee shops close
[4381.28 --> 4388.40]  probably because everyone's buying cocaine but anyways i was that was a ridiculous story that was
[4388.40 --> 4396.80]  funny um what else from ces i don't know i'm gonna look through some of the videos and just kind of
[4396.80 --> 4402.88]  like oh talk about razor edge who's your edge that was the tower oh super wide aspect ratio monitors
[4402.88 --> 4408.48]  okay oh those were ridiculous yeah i know i don't know what to make of it so i don't know if you
[4408.48 --> 4414.56]  guys saw this but uh at ces we saw a couple of okay diesel's calling what does he want hey
[4414.56 --> 4431.44]  uh no he wasn't there uh do you want us to tell that story
[4431.44 --> 4437.52]  no no no he went back with me
[4440.32 --> 4446.56]  the the oh probably yeah i don't know yeah i don't think we should tell that story that's not very pg-13
[4448.40 --> 4455.20]  okay bye uh there's gonna be a lot of questions about that never mind never mind
[4455.20 --> 4463.76]  uh we'll do the um like no the saddam hussein like nothing to see here just
[4465.60 --> 4473.28]  carry on uh super wide aspect ratio monitors so uh we went from four by three which is slightly wider
[4473.28 --> 4480.24]  than it is tall almost a square to five by four which is even more square to 16 by 10 which is not
[4480.24 --> 4488.24]  very square to 16 by 9 which is less square to 16 by 21 which is basically a strip of monitor like this
[4488.88 --> 4500.64]  um lg and asus had monitors on display that were 29 inch ips so gorgeous monitors ideal for movie viewing
[4500.64 --> 4502.48]  what do you gaming perhaps as well
[4504.96 --> 4507.44]  what do you think i don't think so not for gaming
[4507.44 --> 4511.36]  why not one interesting thing okay if you'll game and surround with multiple monitors why not do it
[4511.36 --> 4517.76]  with a bezel even with multiple monitors i play on one screen unless i'm playing like a racing game
[4517.76 --> 4523.52]  or a flight sim that's pretty much the only time okay but what if you were playing an rts from a
[4523.52 --> 4528.32]  company that doesn't have their heads up their behinds about sort of competitive it's going to stay on
[4528.32 --> 4535.68]  one screen that is so stupid you know what supreme commander was so far ahead of like everyone else in
[4535.68 --> 4543.12]  so many ways seriously though physics based content combat instead of stupid die rolling which is how
[4543.12 --> 4548.64]  it should be you could actually program your guys to maneuver in certain ways when meeting an enemy
[4548.64 --> 4554.00]  force so that they'd be less likely to be hit there was an event you know how it's more math and strict
[4554.56 --> 4559.76]  strict strict straightforward strategy that's why it's more competitive oh talking about starcraft
[4559.76 --> 4565.12]  whatever starcraft can can eat it so supreme commander at the time had support for you to
[4565.12 --> 4570.08]  move your mini map onto a second monitor but it wasn't just a mini map you could actually go over
[4570.08 --> 4574.48]  to that second monitor and zoom in on it down to a very small level so you could actually monitor two
[4574.48 --> 4583.04]  places at time why not seriously for competitive games give everyone two monitors the monitor guys will
[4583.04 --> 4588.32]  be happy they get to sell more monitors i think the gamers will be happy they get to monitor two bases
[4588.32 --> 4593.92]  from assumptions being able to monitor two bases competitive edge yeah they want to have everyone
[4593.92 --> 4598.72]  on an equal playing field at least as equal as people aren't on an equal playing field that's why
[4598.72 --> 4606.24]  okay hold on oh why doesn't blizzard go and endow everyone in the world with a fiber internet connection
[4606.24 --> 4612.48]  so that nobody has any latency but this is why doesn't blizzard endow everyone with a gaming machine
[4612.48 --> 4617.76]  that can run at the same resolution blizzard makes sure that all their games why doesn't blizzard
[4618.40 --> 4626.00]  endow everyone with a gaming mouse that has optimal precision and the clicks are are hair trigger clicks
[4626.00 --> 4630.96]  so that everyone has exactly some of the best gaming mouse for starcraft are the old school white
[4630.96 --> 4636.24]  microsoft ones because they're very definitive clicks they don't need any crazy ridiculous dpi ones
[4636.88 --> 4640.56]  starcraft wow all that kind of stuff that blizzard makes they make sure it can run on
[4640.56 --> 4645.20]  a crazy array of systems starcraft is really easy that's just another way of saying that their
[4645.20 --> 4649.44]  graphics look like ass and that they're holding back and that they're holding back pc gaming in
[4649.44 --> 4652.80]  general by not actually pushing the hardware but they're pushing the competitive scene which is
[4652.80 --> 4659.12]  pushing pc game it's not constant okay you don't play starcraft on console starcraft 64 was dumb
[4659.12 --> 4664.96]  it was funny and kind of fun there was starcraft 64 yeah because i know there was warcraft 2 for
[4664.96 --> 4670.32]  playstation there was starcraft 64. oh my goodness i want to get it i want to try it i think it'll be
[4670.32 --> 4677.44]  fun i tried warcraft 2 on playstation it was i was at a game store i was at like a used game store and i was
[4677.44 --> 4682.32]  like like because i played a lot of warcraft 2 back then and i was like seriously isn't it just kind of
[4682.32 --> 4686.96]  awkward though oh it's the worst thing ever oh yeah it's like the most terrible experience you could possibly
[4686.96 --> 4691.52]  have playing an rts it's like halo wars it's like why did you do that that's so weird i've never
[4691.52 --> 4697.44]  played halo wars i just like yeah it's a friend had it so i went to his house and it was just like
[4697.44 --> 4701.92]  okay i don't understand just buy a computer come on like this is just so weird there's certain games
[4701.92 --> 4708.24]  that should not be played on a console um stagger dynamics speaking of buying a computer very cool that
[4708.24 --> 4714.24]  could replace your console i mean it's one of those things where it's like do we need another boutique
[4714.24 --> 4721.12]  system builder and the answer to that question is usually nine yet nix no
[4723.52 --> 4729.60]  no any other yeah any other flavor of absolutely not that you can possibly think of however they're
[4729.60 --> 4735.76]  coming at it from a new perspective which i i have to respect so number one is every system's liquid cooled
[4735.76 --> 4742.16]  which i mean okay it's been done before okay number two is they're only using the ballinist hardware
[4742.16 --> 4747.92]  which has been done before number three is they have a special case which has been done before but
[4747.92 --> 4753.92]  hasn't necessarily been done this well before and in this way and in this way before and number five
[4753.92 --> 4761.28]  is they're going after the living room so this i haven't seen nearly as much before now silverstone's
[4761.28 --> 4766.48]  tried to do extremely high-end home theater cases they've had like seven inch touch screen displays on
[4766.48 --> 4769.36]  them and i kind of go guys really touch screen
[4772.64 --> 4777.92]  it's theater it's at the front it's supposed to be 15 feet away from the viewer so i mean you know they
[4777.92 --> 4783.20]  meant well but and that was back when windows xp was a thing so touch screen on windows xp
[4785.12 --> 4792.40]  yeah that's like handy clap right um so that wasn't that great but uh no that was i was like who's
[4792.40 --> 4798.56]  trying to come in i'm like wrestling all the stuff that's like oh my goodness that's like uh that's
[4798.56 --> 4806.16]  like uh an invidia like sure you can but it's green yeah nvidia that's what i said okay that's like
[4806.16 --> 4810.24]  nvidia green i was gonna say a baneling what was i talking about what that is do you yeah i know what a
[4810.24 --> 4814.16]  baneling is i know what star i played starcraft i played three rounds of starcraft today
[4814.16 --> 4825.52]  okay hey i did play it you owned it well that's how i played it smart guy they have trials
[4827.44 --> 4834.16]  yeah trials are just oh well no i needed to use it for benchmarking i can't have a trial for that
[4835.60 --> 4840.16]  actually i think it would still work still i'm not sure no i don't know if they're
[4840.16 --> 4843.84]  trial okay the benchmarking that we use is a custom no blizzard is you don't know what it is
[4843.84 --> 4848.80]  because you've never run that one blizzard is the king of trials that are like the worst thing ever
[4848.80 --> 4853.12]  if you can run a custom game i have no idea if you can on the trial because i owned it as well well
[4853.12 --> 4859.12]  it expires after 14 days like you can't no there's like a starter edition well that's is that a
[4859.12 --> 4864.48]  different thing than a trial yeah because there's no like well trial is a very specific it's like
[4864.48 --> 4868.08]  free to play starcraft i think you can even play multiplayer but you can only play as taran
[4868.88 --> 4873.76]  what yeah like it's kind of weird okay well that's that's not the thing that i had i had i had
[4873.76 --> 4878.72]  trials like uh nvidia was giving out starcraft 2 trials with graphics cards yeah okay but there's
[4878.72 --> 4883.60]  like it came out later so he calls me ignorant but it turns out he's actually talking about a completely
[4883.60 --> 4888.80]  different thing than what he was actually talking says start if he said starter edition i'd have said
[4888.80 --> 4894.32]  geez like what starter edition please tell me more about it because i really do like hearing your opinion on
[4894.32 --> 4903.92]  things that's crap um what the heck were we talking about no idea sticker dynamics yeah sticker dynamics
[4903.92 --> 4910.00]  okay so they're going after the living room so it's a super high-end chassis it has a beautiful display
[4910.00 --> 4916.56]  on the front it's big it's like this big and uh the the chassis is set up for just ball and liquid
[4916.56 --> 4922.16]  cooling it's like this tall so it's like thick and awesome it has a window on the top it looks absolutely
[4922.16 --> 4927.36]  beautiful we might have a unit coming in so we can do some awesome like glamour footage of it and show
[4927.36 --> 4935.44]  you guys exactly what a system like this looks like and i mean is it expensive yes but if you want
[4935.44 --> 4941.04]  like the best home theater solution possible and great for gaming along with like a couch master we
[4941.04 --> 4946.40]  unboxed that recently which is kind of awesome um but like look at it from this perspective it wasn't
[4946.40 --> 4950.56]  that long ago that any random desktop computer was like five thousand dollars and people didn't
[4950.56 --> 4957.92]  really blink an eye is it that crazy to spend money on a computer that's awesome um i mean you could go
[4957.92 --> 4963.60]  buy an hp and you could build your own but you wouldn't actually be able to build something quite
[4963.60 --> 4969.44]  like this and the way they do the cabling is absolutely immaculate like it's as good as anyone but
[4969.44 --> 4974.08]  the very very top tier of elitist enthusiasts would build for themselves like it's probably better than i
[4974.08 --> 4978.96]  would build to be perfectly honest just due to like time and whatnot well time and just general
[4978.96 --> 4984.00]  patience and general skill i have no metal working background which is a huge detriment i think
[4984.00 --> 4992.48]  mainly time considering your computer isn't running yet yes okay i will what what did i say you said before
[4993.12 --> 4998.48]  star citizen before star citizen hits alpha my computer will be done and i will say this although we
[4998.48 --> 5003.84]  can't talk about embargoed and nondis md products but i will have my computer up and running before
[5003.84 --> 5011.76]  there's a replacement for the 690 so i will only be one generation behind by the time my computer is
[5011.76 --> 5020.72]  actually done so there still the entire time i've known you you haven't had a real fully working computer
[5020.72 --> 5027.20]  it was working it was on a bench yes sitting on like carpet with ssds just like sprawling out on the floor yes
[5027.20 --> 5033.60]  i don't think that counts it was working i don't think it counts it was working i didn't have the 590
[5033.60 --> 5038.08]  in it but i had like a 480 or something okay whatever i don't want to talk to you
[5041.12 --> 5042.00]  what else was cool
[5044.56 --> 5049.20]  oh yeah the silverstone dust we didn't even finish talking about the monitor oh yeah the monitor
[5049.92 --> 5054.40]  oh yeah i wanted to take twitter questions about that or something yeah twitter comments over the right
[5054.40 --> 5057.68]  then i started looking for the keyboard then i couldn't find it because you hit it on me again
[5058.96 --> 5064.88]  i'm pretty sure you're the one that repeatedly puts it there i'm pretty sure that that's probably right
[5066.00 --> 5069.92]  okay so let's do some let's do some twitter stuff for a little bit here to close this out guys
[5070.96 --> 5081.28]  uh back to the top no i completely lost my voice in ces that was kind of rough yeah it's hard to be a
[5081.28 --> 5088.16]  video guy when you have no voice it's like not good business uh whoa holy crap 19 new interactions
[5088.16 --> 5095.12]  since i did that uh oh we have to do our windows 8 giveaway we'll do that soon um i hope i win the
[5095.12 --> 5100.56]  giveaway good sorry for spamming but in my defense diesel told us to mention about slicks dancing you
[5100.56 --> 5108.80]  danced not much not much at all diesel was the king dancer what is he talking about no when did you
[5108.80 --> 5114.24]  dance i don't think that's what i'm curious about i don't think you'd probably be good at dancing
[5115.36 --> 5122.00]  diesel's kind of crazy i like diesel's dance style he's just he's nuts he's fun he's is very fun okay
[5122.00 --> 5127.44]  this is interesting so the 7870 joker apparently has a tahiti gpu so i don't know why they're calling
[5127.44 --> 5133.44]  it a 7870 that's just stupid they should just call it like a 7900 se or something then right so it's
[5133.44 --> 5140.64]  similar to the uh the coordination card yeah except that that was an actual thing 560 ti 448 was an
[5140.64 --> 5147.76]  actual thing whereas when you call it 7870 and it's a 7950 then that's just yeah that's stupid that's
[5147.76 --> 5153.04]  like that's like that's like intel saying we have innovated we have made the fastest core i3
[5153.84 --> 5160.40]  but they actually just yeah they just sand down the ihs on a core i7 and like like write core i3 on it
[5160.40 --> 5168.08]  in crayon like that's not in crayon that's not a best part that's not a fast 7870 that's just a slow 7950
[5168.08 --> 5173.76]  then um i'm super interested in windows 8 phone sounds good anything to say on surface pro surface
[5173.76 --> 5181.76]  pro i actually i i love surface the first surface i love the form factor i love the way that it's got a
[5181.76 --> 5186.40]  keyboard and a tablet and it's just it's super lightweight and the keyboard is actually just a
[5186.40 --> 5195.04]  cover and like i love the whole idea surface pro i think i have to wait for gen 2 or maybe even gen 2
[5195.04 --> 5201.52]  of surface 1 once apps are better and once it's running tegra 4 because tegra 4 is going to be way
[5201.52 --> 5208.72]  faster than tegra 3 so surface is sort of achilles heel is the speed of the cpu surface pro's achilles
[5208.72 --> 5216.24]  heel is the power efficiency of the cpu so it's going to be surface 2 versus surface pro 2
[5216.64 --> 5222.40]  where we really find out which of those platforms is the real deal because by then intel will have
[5222.40 --> 5230.00]  launched their haswell based low power cpus which will be just like destructor in terms of performance
[5230.00 --> 5236.64]  and should have power consumption that's right down there with the mobile stuff surface pro is probably
[5236.64 --> 5241.76]  like okay it only gets three to three and a half hours of battery no no i'm saying surface like that line
[5241.76 --> 5245.60]  like the service pro line is probably the first tablet that i would legitimately like okay when
[5245.60 --> 5249.60]  netbooks came out all the students were like oh yeah i can have this tiny little thing that i can
[5249.60 --> 5254.00]  take the class then everyone's like wow this sucks and then just kind of stopped i have a netbook you
[5254.00 --> 5259.84]  saw where i keep it yeah just like in like a corner um i can't even really describe it better than like
[5259.84 --> 5264.08]  this little corner it's just like shoved in the corner there's like some power supplies here and then
[5264.08 --> 5268.40]  there's like some other random crap here like water cooling stuff and then it's like slotted in between them
[5268.40 --> 5275.28]  yeah just no cares were given um and then tablets came out and people oh i can take this to class and
[5275.28 --> 5279.92]  use this and they're like uh ipad is kind of an awesome experience but i wouldn't use it for
[5279.92 --> 5286.32]  any serious work exactly it's an entertainment device strictly pro is the first line that i'm like okay
[5287.12 --> 5291.28]  i could actually probably take this to class and actually use it you know what i would make the same
[5291.28 --> 5298.16]  argument about surface yeah because you have office that's the key but not for my classes i need
[5298.40 --> 5302.72]  full applications okay and there's a lot of people that go to school that need full applications
[5302.72 --> 5309.04]  then i can see like it's it's very cool that i can just install something on my tablet that i have
[5309.04 --> 5314.40]  on my desktop why not just get something like a tai chi then that's the double-sided notebook tablet
[5314.40 --> 5318.72]  thing with the rotation or not rotation it just goes down and becomes a tablet so it's got screens on
[5318.72 --> 5324.48]  both sides of the top so much bigger okay that's true that's pretty much the main and only but it has a
[5324.48 --> 5330.00]  proper keyboard whereas even touch cover and type cover are both inferior keyboards compared to what
[5330.00 --> 5336.24]  you get on tai chi not to be like too negative but i hate the touch cover it was usable for me it was
[5336.24 --> 5342.80]  usable but it felt so awkward you press and there's no uh give it more time what is it called tactile feedback
[5342.80 --> 5347.84]  tactile feedback there's no tactile feedback at all so you like and it feels like there should be what if
[5347.84 --> 5352.08]  what if a gen 2 touch cover had haptic feedback or something like that i'd be okay with that because
[5352.08 --> 5356.88]  that's probably not a bad idea any microsoft employees watching haptic feedback on touch cover 2.
[5357.92 --> 5362.00]  it shouldn't be that hard i don't think i don't know i'm not an engineer but
[5362.56 --> 5364.64]  i don't think it should be that hard hey
[5367.20 --> 5370.48]  what do you mean you're smart um
[5373.20 --> 5377.44]  oh apparently we crashed the stagger dynamics website yes
[5377.44 --> 5384.96]  uh where are we going with this right so surface right so the second gen that's where like cool
[5384.96 --> 5390.32]  that's where things are getting real um so it's gonna be tegra 4 which will fix everything that was
[5390.32 --> 5396.00]  wrong with tegra 3 versus haswell mobile which will fix hopefully everything that's wrong with ivy
[5396.00 --> 5401.84]  bridge and we're gonna find out once those two are much closer do we and the apps will be more mature
[5401.84 --> 5406.72]  by then do we need the full windows 8 experience or does everyone need the full windows 8 experience
[5406.72 --> 5412.72]  because some people do or is rt good enough so it'll just depend mainly on who you are and i think
[5412.72 --> 5418.56]  it'll be cool having the two different skis right uh what happened to slick's phone ha you know what
[5418.56 --> 5423.68]  why don't you tell that story while i prepare the windows 8 giveaway okay so we're all ridiculously
[5423.68 --> 5430.16]  obscenely tired and just finished packing and we're all sitting there with all of our bags by the door
[5430.16 --> 5434.56]  and linus is like we should get our tickets ready on our phones so he emails out the tickets to
[5435.36 --> 5441.76]  everybody diesel and myself and himself obviously um and we all go get our tickets on our phone for
[5441.76 --> 5446.48]  some reason i couldn't connect to the hotel's wi-fi i have no idea why i was able to it all the time so
[5446.48 --> 5451.92]  i'm sitting there frustratedly working with my phone my shoes are untied at the same point in time so i
[5451.92 --> 5457.12]  eventually get ticked off and just tell them both to pick up the ticket on their phones as well for me
[5457.12 --> 5462.96]  so that they can submit my ticket i put my phone down tie my shoes get up grab my bags and leave
[5463.68 --> 5470.72]  um i realized part way through the taxi ride that like oh no i don't have my phone because i always
[5470.72 --> 5474.72]  keep it in my front right hand pocket so i kind of noticed i was like something feels weird and then
[5474.72 --> 5479.20]  i kind of noticed my phone's out there luckily if you watch the ccs coverage you probably saw him a
[5479.20 --> 5486.88]  little bit harrison my buddy is still in that hotel room so when i got back or no i borrowed linus's phone
[5486.88 --> 5492.80]  and texted harrison and was like hey can you grab my phone so he's shipping that to me i still
[5492.80 --> 5498.72]  won't have it for a while it's really weird not having a phone i lasted through pretty much almost
[5498.72 --> 5504.96]  all of high school without a phone and liked it but now that i have one oh i don't know flip phones
[5504.96 --> 5509.52]  i never really cared about smartphones is completely different because i can do email and i can do
[5509.52 --> 5514.08]  everything else on my phone so it just feels very awkward not having my phone i hope i get it soon
[5514.08 --> 5520.48]  but that was kind of a crappy story i never usually leave my phone places that was just
[5520.48 --> 5529.28]  massive sleep deprivation and distractions um i also left my watch there really yeah harrison got
[5529.28 --> 5534.96]  that as well oh you got that as well okay oh that's like super disappointing that would have been
[5534.96 --> 5540.80]  ridiculously sad as well because that's a very cool watch that's a uh something something tokyo tokyo
[5540.80 --> 5547.68]  flash rpn yeah tokyo flash rpn that's a very cool we did an unboxing of that at one point so slick is
[5547.68 --> 5554.64]  the one who ended up with uh with that watch all right windows 8 giveaway time drum roll
[5557.52 --> 5559.84]  okay so um
[5561.68 --> 5568.64]  to me tech tv hold on i'm gonna i'm gonna bring up the channel that you guys are supposed to be following
[5568.64 --> 5576.24]  because they are actually the ones that are contributing these prizes these windows 8s are
[5576.24 --> 5585.60]  not coming from me they are coming from timmy tech tv um and i would like to give you guys a question
[5585.60 --> 5592.72]  that will rely on you guys actually having been paying attention to timmy tech tv besides just being
[5592.72 --> 5598.72]  like sort of you know wham bam thank you ma'am that prize is fantastic thank you so much and we're never
[5598.72 --> 5604.96]  going to look at anything you do ever again so timmy actually gave me a question to ask you guys that will
[5604.96 --> 5619.04]  be what storage boot drive did tim use in the m atx build
[5619.04 --> 5626.24]  so i know at least some of you are going to try to cheat and that's fine cheating is encouraged
[5627.60 --> 5633.52]  but it will be the first one to tweet us the correct answer and i want exactly the correct answer i want
[5633.52 --> 5642.88]  the capacity i want any little symbols that go along with it i want exactly what ssd was used take the time
[5642.88 --> 5649.68]  type it properly i'm gonna guess but using my hand how would you how could you possibly know this i i
[5649.68 --> 5652.24]  haven't seen it i'm just gonna make a guess you're gonna guess okay
[5656.40 --> 5657.52]  i don't even know what that was
[5661.28 --> 5669.76]  no no no you're wrong you lose you lose and yes i do have i do have phones behind me but unfortunately
[5669.76 --> 5676.24]  slick does not have his sim so yeah that's kind of useless you're you're boninated i could use it as a
[5677.68 --> 5686.96]  email and everything you could but i have a computer so i want the exact model i'm not giving any hints
[5687.92 --> 5696.40]  any hints there's so many different exact model capacity and everything yeah capacity i want the exact exact
[5696.40 --> 5704.96]  model name not the part number just i just want the model name in its completest form there's there's a couple of people guessing the exact same thing i guessed
[5706.80 --> 5710.40]  yeah there's a lot of people guessing a lot of things that aren't quite right
[5711.44 --> 5718.32]  aren't quite right aren't quite right i don't just want the brand guys i want the model name of the ssd
[5718.32 --> 5732.24]  let's go down let's go down oh oh yeah we should talk about um we should talk about google fiber
[5732.24 --> 5738.40]  after that's not rolling out in canada is it no we should talk about how mad we are about that very
[5738.40 --> 5743.60]  mad very mad especially bc we're let out in bc we have crappy internet i know like really
[5743.60 --> 5750.16]  it's not that bad it's pretty bad i mean shaw has some good plans oh okay hold on
[5752.80 --> 5757.44]  you have to check yeah i can't remember exactly what it is so uh no no it's okay
[5758.64 --> 5764.32]  okay i'll say this martin's really close but he's not there he's actually missed the actual like
[5765.12 --> 5773.04]  brand or like he's missed the uh the series name uh see a lot of people like i don't know how many times
[5773.04 --> 5780.32]  have i said i don't want to see a capacity with a manufacturer i want to know exactly which one see v series
[5780.32 --> 5785.52]  is not good enough dude dude dude dude and it wasn't a v200
[5785.52 --> 5807.36]  okay let's see if peter was the first one there we go kingston 128 gig ssd now v plus hold on did
[5807.36 --> 5815.60]  anyone get it before peter why do people keep saying 8 40 are you guys just guessing that's what i
[5815.60 --> 5824.80]  guessed peter you are the winner all right so peter i'm gonna follow you on twitter follow so that you
[5824.80 --> 5832.40]  can send me a direct message claiming your prize winner winner chicken dinner there is actually no
[5832.40 --> 5837.36]  chicken dinner included in the prize although if you ask really nicely i might throw in one of those
[5837.36 --> 5845.28]  twinkies that we ate on the live stream about a month ago and then he died don't eat it and then
[5845.28 --> 5852.80]  linus got his copy of windows 8 send it a month or two before so you don't have to pay for shipping yes
[5854.08 --> 5861.36]  saving two bucks yes i actually actually tim's the one who's sending it out okay so we're gonna close
[5861.36 --> 5866.32]  with how mad we are about google fiber so google fiber is basically google's way of telling the
[5866.32 --> 5873.28]  internet service providers yo you see that butt that you're sitting on that's so fat it's time to
[5873.28 --> 5879.84]  not sit on that fat butt anymore and actually improve the infrastructure that's going on and like
[5880.72 --> 5886.48]  like seriously you look at what they used to have to invest for infrastructure versus what they're
[5886.48 --> 5894.24]  willing to do now copper wasn't cheap like 20 years ago running the wire wasn't cheap and i understand
[5894.24 --> 5902.72]  that they want that investment to pay for itself bloody bloody bloody blah however fiber isn't ridiculously
[5902.72 --> 5907.68]  unreasonable to run and the infrastructure that's going into it isn't ridiculously unreasonable
[5907.68 --> 5910.96]  it's just a matter of well we don't have to
[5910.96 --> 5917.36]  so google's making them have to google is making them have to so they've rolled it out what what is
[5917.36 --> 5922.88]  it like kentucky or something stupid like kentucky i'm pretty sure and one other place i think it's
[5922.88 --> 5929.76]  just it's a very limited rollout where google is rolling out gigabit internet to freaking awesome gigabit
[5929.76 --> 5937.36]  like up down gigabit internet to us to selected communities so that basically like like think about
[5937.36 --> 5944.88]  this guys you'd be able to take a full uncompressed dvd rip and transfer that at sort sort about 100
[5944.88 --> 5953.36]  megabytes per second so about four seconds per or rather um 10 seconds per whatever so it'll be so in
[5953.36 --> 5960.80]  about 45 seconds you could transfer an entire dvd from your house to like your buddy's house over the
[5960.80 --> 5967.28]  interwebs just like freaking drag and drop that would be just like the best thing ever so cool
[5967.28 --> 5973.60]  we could host as many forums as we wanted uh with fiber however they're not rolling it out in
[5973.60 --> 5979.76]  canada and i kind of understand why because compared to american isps canada i actually and you can
[5979.76 --> 5984.24]  complain all you want about them i can actually no i get it i somewhat understand what they're talking
[5984.24 --> 5990.80]  about because you look at even things like high speed is not rolled out across all of bc yet because
[5990.80 --> 5995.84]  there's just so much land to cover like i get it it just sucks i want faster internet like when they're when
[5995.84 --> 6000.80]  it's going to cost them like you know a couple hundred thousand dollars to do a cable run to like
[6001.36 --> 6008.64]  your house hundred mile house where there's like 40 people like do the math if each of those people is
[6008.64 --> 6015.28]  paying 39.99 for their light speed plan because there are a bunch of people who don't necessarily
[6015.28 --> 6019.68]  care because they're busy hunting or chopping firewood or whatever else people do out there
[6020.56 --> 6024.88]  i love my country brother and actually i grew up in like totally the sticks so i'm not just i'm not just
[6024.88 --> 6029.52]  ripping on you guys but quite frankly there's other things to do other than the internet especially
[6029.52 --> 6034.72]  like the culture there is different so they're all on their 39.99 high speed plans light speed plans
[6036.80 --> 6043.20]  how long does it take that to pay for itself so yes there has to be a subsidy that comes from the
[6043.20 --> 6048.32]  denser areas especially somewhere like canada where it's this enormous land mass i mean think about this
[6048.32 --> 6052.40]  guys canada has fewer people than the state of california alone
[6055.12 --> 6059.28]  i'ma let that sink in for a minute in terms of population density
[6061.44 --> 6061.68]  yeah
[6064.08 --> 6070.48]  has it sunk in now because canada has the second largest land mass on earth after russia
[6070.48 --> 6078.00]  and like nobody lives there so uh so yeah i kind of understand but in the states i am so glad to see
[6078.00 --> 6084.80]  this happening because what i expect is especially along the uh along the bottom regions of canada
[6084.80 --> 6090.40]  especially down over near the great lakes i would expect the infrastructure that's getting built to
[6090.40 --> 6096.16]  kind of creep its way over the border slowly to cities like vancouver and toronto where people like
[6096.16 --> 6101.36]  yours truly will get to take advantage of them because the internet has not been speeding up fast
[6101.36 --> 6107.36]  enough compared to everything else that's going on and if we're going to have a chance of being on the
[6107.36 --> 6113.52]  cutting edge of some of the technologies that are coming whether you like them or not things like ip
[6113.52 --> 6119.44]  gaming it's coming they will be able to roll that note but think about it imagine if you were on a fiber
[6119.44 --> 6125.52]  gigabit connection i just want my own rig who cares at that point though i just want my own rig why
[6126.32 --> 6131.68]  because what if the latencies were like three milliseconds i have what is okay all together
[6131.68 --> 6137.20]  i have like a hundred and something gigs of cloud storage available and i use like 24 megabytes well
[6137.20 --> 6141.52]  that's because it's so inaccessible what if you could access it at full gigabit it's still pretty
[6141.52 --> 6146.56]  accessible for documents and stuff and i just don't that's irresponsible though i don't like it i like
[6146.56 --> 6151.84]  having local storage do you have a raid backup of it i have a backup are you using my server
[6156.16 --> 6157.60]  you're so fired
[6163.84 --> 6174.48]  now you know and knowing is half the battle um so like anyways uh okay ip gaming is coming whether
[6174.48 --> 6180.00]  guys like this believe in it or not 30 years from now a gaming pc will be a relic i know it's coming
[6180.00 --> 6185.92]  so we need the latencies or what we need to not have the latencies we need to have two three
[6185.92 --> 6191.68]  millisecond latencies in order for a technology like that to even make any sense to have the image
[6191.68 --> 6198.64]  rendered in the cloud and then beam to us and have our inputs going to that that cloud-based uh rendering
[6198.64 --> 6206.08]  solution so um fiber is the only solution so in order for like because countries like japan are going to be
[6206.08 --> 6212.48]  able to roll out fiber to all like that because they have this population density you run like
[6212.48 --> 6219.36]  a kilometer of fiber and you reach like a bajillion people in their high rises that can now all be tapped
[6219.36 --> 6226.40]  into these these wide wide backbones we can't do it here and that's fine but it means that north america
[6226.40 --> 6230.40]  is going to fall behind on the technology curve so google's doing their part to kind of step up and
[6230.40 --> 6235.76]  make that a reality put some pressure on those guys i love it i'm happy to see it and i'd hope that
[6235.76 --> 6240.16]  within the next three to five years i'll be able to get a beast connection here i mean already now
[6240.16 --> 6246.40]  over copper i can get 250 down i just wish the isps would stop being so stingy about upload and that's
[6246.40 --> 6250.16]  another place where google's really pushing the envelope with this technology where they're saying
[6250.16 --> 6257.12]  no a gigabit pipe is a gigabit pipe gigabit up gigabit down what do you think this is because yeah
[6257.12 --> 6264.48]  like come on upload has always been terrible i remember before we upgraded at our house we had 50 kilobytes
[6264.48 --> 6273.44]  kilobytes 512k effective yeah oh yeah 50 kilobytes oh yeah 50 kilobytes effective like what and that was
[6273.44 --> 6280.16]  a high speed plan yeah if anyone did anything you just you're done my mom would be like oh i'm gonna
[6280.16 --> 6287.20]  upload a youtube video of my dog it's just like no one can use the internet for a day yeah so so that
[6287.20 --> 6292.64]  needs to just go away and die in a fire and that's very exciting and i think that's probably pretty much
[6292.64 --> 6298.40]  going to do it for our live stream tonight if you guys missed the beginning of the live stream then
[6298.40 --> 6303.92]  please do go ahead and watch the archive on youtube if you missed the end of the live stream then you
[6303.92 --> 6310.32]  aren't watching right now so whatever don't forget to subscribe to linus tech tips don't forget to
[6310.32 --> 6317.92]  enter the unbox therapy um thing what's it called giveaway giveaway and we should post a poll on forums with
[6317.92 --> 6324.00]  this okay and don't forget to visit the linus tech tips dot com forum that didn't happen no no i didn't
[6324.00 --> 6330.48]  see it it's not recorded on video no um so visit the linus tech tips dot com forum you know what just
[6330.48 --> 6338.80]  just for lols register and post a question and post an answer to someone else just for fun even if you've
[6338.80 --> 6343.92]  never joined a forum before we really do want this community to be friendly to people who haven't really
[6343.92 --> 6350.08]  done this before we are using the cutting edge v bulletin 5 which has been a real challenge but
