Maybe there's more to life than YouTube... Even for YouTubers...

Much research has been done for the gear, and there are lots of secret projects coming that no one knows about yet ;)

Just for fun I'm going to reply to this.

1. no.

2. that won't help with the other things I am trying to do (like shoot video in 4K)

3. Already said I have a new mic and camera on order :)

Because I'm buying nice gear that I can use for live streams AND things other than live streams... Secret projects :o

you are a boss.

Here are my reasons:
1. Twitch is a new community I can help educate about hardware. Gamers by and large don'tï»¿ know much about it and there's good to be done there.
2. I already "get" YouTube and it never hurts to learn something new
3. Live Hangouts are non-monetizable. Twitch.TV can be monetized in the future if I decided to partner with them (offer is already on the table)
4. The quality is better
5. Hangouts has that ridiculous thumbnail at the bottom
6. Clicking the link is easy 4 U

I recommend to just run a wire.
