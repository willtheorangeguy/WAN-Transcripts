[0.00 → 10.88] Welcome to the Linus Tech Tips live stream featuring the one, the only, um, you.
[11.40 → 11.80] Me?
[11.88 → 12.54] What is your name?
[13.02 → 13.34] Slick?
[13.54 → 15.66] Yeah, yeah, this guy on Twitter.
[15.82 → 17.66] Actually, it looks like I could be pointing anywhere.
[17.74 → 19.88] I have a really, really weird birth certificate.
[20.60 → 20.90] Really?
[21.16 → 21.84] Slick PC?
[22.88 → 24.56] No, you don't.
[24.56 → 30.36] So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys tonight, and, uh, knock on wood, there
[30.36 → 35.86] should be no technical difficulties because we, I think, have finally pretty much sorted
[35.86 → 40.00] out our entire streaming setup, including our microphone.
[40.32 → 42.72] We're actually finally using our high-end camera.
[43.20 → 47.08] Can we, can we knock on, like, every piece of wood in existence before the stream just
[47.08 → 50.74] crashes randomly because of something out of our control?
[51.36 → 52.64] Yeah, actually, you know what?
[52.64 → 53.30] We've figured everything out.
[53.30 → 59.00] Last week, last week was a little bit rough because, uh, the issues were actually caused
[59.00 → 66.68] by, um, my internet just deciding that it hated its life and, uh, that it didn't want
[66.68 → 70.22] to help us stream to you guys anymore, so that was super disappointing.
[70.70 → 73.56] Are you going to be running on battery throughout the entire live stream there?
[73.58 → 73.80] Yep.
[74.18 → 75.52] Oh, that's not going to work.
[77.52 → 78.40] Turn the mic down.
[79.02 → 79.76] Turn the mic down?
[79.84 → 80.36] Turn the mic down.
[80.36 → 82.34] This is the first time anyone's ever said that.
[82.34 → 84.22] Yeah, but apparently we're clipping.
[85.10 → 85.50] Aye-ya.
[86.42 → 86.78] Okay.
[86.92 → 89.54] We finally figured everything out and the live stream's perfect.
[89.54 → 90.64] Mr-Mr-mr-mr-mr.
[91.18 → 91.62] Nope.
[94.36 → 95.54] Okay, talk, talk.
[96.60 → 97.06] Uh, hello?
[97.34 → 98.22] How's the audio, guys?
[98.36 → 99.06] How's everything working?
[99.24 → 99.68] Is it good?
[99.90 → 100.36] Is it bad?
[100.64 → 101.48] Everyone's saying no.
[101.48 → 102.64] I don't know what no means.
[103.92 → 104.58] Mic is good?
[104.66 → 105.04] Mic's good?
[105.10 → 105.50] It's fine.
[106.94 → 107.60] It's good.
[107.74 → 108.30] Audio's good.
[108.44 → 108.66] Volume.
[109.10 → 109.34] Volume.
[109.34 → 111.10] Apparently the volume was perfect.
[113.28 → 115.60] We're getting conflicting answers here.
[118.18 → 118.58] Okay.
[118.58 → 120.66] Don't want to turn it down.
[120.88 → 121.30] Too quiet.
[121.42 → 121.80] Too quiet.
[121.88 → 122.46] Turn it back up.
[125.16 → 126.22] Can you turn it like a little...
[126.22 → 127.58] Can you turn it a little bit back up?
[127.84 → 128.32] Not really.
[129.04 → 129.60] Not really?
[130.14 → 130.40] I don't know.
[130.40 → 132.02] I had that sound, but it was like...
[132.02 → 133.24] It's almost back to where it was.
[133.52 → 133.84] Okay.
[133.98 → 134.22] Okay.
[134.28 → 136.98] Well, at any rate, we don't have to talk that loud, so...
[136.98 → 139.64] Here we go.
[139.74 → 141.08] So what should we start with today?
[141.26 → 144.46] We have our hands on a Galaxy S4, which is pretty exciting.
[145.20 → 151.66] For those of you who don't know, the Galaxy S4 is Apple's first foray into the Android marketplace.
[153.00 → 160.62] So previously, Apple was really on sort of locked-down hardware-software marriage type of configuration
[160.62 → 164.08] where they really didn't believe in using open-source software like Android,
[164.30 → 166.76] but they have done a complete reversal.
[167.30 → 173.68] Steve Jobs has risen from the dead and come back to lead the company into the bright horizon that is Android.
[174.78 → 176.54] I was just seeing if you were paying attention.
[177.22 → 180.70] Because I'm pretty sure it took you a while to figure out what I was talking about.
[180.72 → 182.38] It did, because I've got other stuff to deal with.
[183.82 → 187.66] So what we're actually going to be talking about is first impressions of the S4.
[187.66 → 191.12] So I don't think... Have you spent much time with it hands-on?
[191.42 → 191.86] None.
[192.20 → 192.44] Okay.
[192.68 → 197.36] So for those of you who haven't seen it already, there's a video on the Linus Tech Tips channel
[197.36 → 203.48] where I was at my briefing on the S4 with Samsung where they showed me the ins and outs of the device.
[203.78 → 211.22] And there were some things that I thought were somewhat trivial that ended up being a far bigger deal
[211.22 → 213.04] once I had it explained to me correctly.
[213.04 → 215.74] And it's not just like, explain to me correctly like,
[215.86 → 217.92] Hey Linus, where's your back pocket?
[218.00 → 219.12] I got a $100 bill here.
[219.16 → 221.06] I'm just going to slip that in there and give you a little pat.
[221.08 → 221.94] No, it wasn't like that.
[222.00 → 228.62] It was, hey Linus, you know that feature where the screen works even if you don't quite touch it?
[228.94 → 232.34] Well, what about this Mr. Canadian over there?
[232.40 → 233.34] What about when you're wearing gloves?
[233.40 → 234.28] And I'm like, oh.
[237.18 → 237.58] Right?
[237.58 → 242.90] Because when I first heard about that feature where you can control the touchscreen without actually quite touching it,
[242.94 → 243.44] I was like, oh.
[244.54 → 245.58] Who needs that, right?
[245.96 → 248.06] But then all of a sudden I'm like, oh, that's right.
[248.14 → 254.18] So now you can actually interface with the device even when you don't have your hands.
[255.12 → 256.70] Well, I mean, you'll still need hands.
[257.10 → 258.14] That would probably be a good thing.
[258.40 → 261.84] Mind you, you were telling me about that gamer who plays without hands.
[262.02 → 262.32] Yeah.
[262.90 → 264.58] Oh, should we transition to that now?
[264.58 → 265.60] No, no, don't worry.
[265.68 → 266.92] We'll make it back to S4.
[267.04 → 268.12] It's on my list.
[268.20 → 269.46] I'm going to grab the S4 while you talk about that.
[269.46 → 271.06] But are we going to jump into the Diablo thing?
[271.38 → 272.06] No, no, no.
[272.08 → 272.96] We'll talk about that later.
[273.12 → 273.98] So we're just going to talk about him.
[274.20 → 279.48] I think his name is Look No Hands, although it could be some other variation of that.
[279.68 → 280.78] You just hit your head on a light.
[280.90 → 282.62] That's kind of funny, but no one saw it.
[284.40 → 289.94] But his hands are messed up, so what he does is he presses the controller against his face to control the game.
[290.00 → 292.70] And he plays Call of Duty and stuff, and it's actually pretty awesome.
[292.80 → 294.00] He's got videos on YouTube and stuff.
[294.00 → 294.46] Check it out.
[294.52 → 295.30] It's actually really cool.
[295.40 → 297.80] And he's actually legit by the look of things.
[297.96 → 300.08] He's pretty good, too, which is crazy.
[300.40 → 305.68] I mean, he's not good 10 to 1 kill to death ratio, but he's good 2 to 1.
[306.04 → 312.98] He's good to the point where if you didn't see his name, you'd have no idea that he didn't have hands, which is kind of insane.
[314.14 → 315.10] So I got my hands.
[315.20 → 319.28] Speaking of hands, I got my hands on one of those Intel beanies, they call them.
[319.30 → 320.74] Here in Canada, we call them toques.
[320.82 → 321.80] Show your face mask thing.
[321.80 → 324.28] But the way it fits is a little funny.
[324.38 → 325.28] It almost looks like...
[325.28 → 331.60] Because if you fold it up, you don't really see the graphic.
[332.22 → 336.72] And then if you don't fold it up, then it actually ends up covering your whole face.
[336.72 → 342.54] So the crazy Russian suggested to me that this is probably the best way to wear it.
[342.86 → 343.40] How do I look?
[344.04 → 344.74] It's fantastic.
[345.12 → 347.54] It looks like a really, really crappy version of Ghost.
[348.22 → 348.58] Sweet.
[348.84 → 349.88] And the skull's off.
[350.10 → 350.96] The skull's off where?
[350.96 → 353.98] Turn it to the right.
[354.60 → 355.26] To the right?
[355.48 → 356.30] Your right or my right?
[356.38 → 356.74] Your right.
[357.18 → 357.58] How's that?
[357.88 → 359.76] That's a little bit better, but now the mouth is a little bit off.
[359.82 → 360.42] So do the bottom.
[360.84 → 361.28] A little bit.
[361.62 → 362.24] There you go.
[362.52 → 362.88] We good?
[363.74 → 364.08] Okay.
[364.70 → 367.50] Will you give me 10 bucks if I do the rest of the live stream like this?
[367.58 → 369.92] If you do the entire rest of the live stream like this?
[370.06 → 370.60] 10 bucks.
[371.56 → 374.16] See, I would say yes, but that would get ancient.
[374.38 → 376.06] And I think people wouldn't like it after a while.
[376.06 → 378.78] Not only that, but I can't read, and I can't see.
[378.94 → 380.56] Like, I actually can't see through this thing.
[380.82 → 385.34] So anyway, guys, if you didn't hear about it before, Intel was giving away beanies.
[385.34 → 389.78] If you got a 3570K or a 3770K or whatever else.
[389.92 → 395.04] One of the Twitch chat members would just like to inform you that it's an improvement on your look.
[395.20 → 395.86] Oh, thank you.
[396.18 → 396.58] Thank you.
[398.28 → 399.06] Thanks for that.
[399.80 → 401.50] Anyway, so back to the S4.
[402.32 → 403.10] So, okay.
[403.32 → 403.46] Right.
[403.46 → 406.22] So I was more impressed than I was expecting to be.
[406.30 → 411.94] Now, one of the things that pictures really didn't convey well was the build of the device.
[412.04 → 412.88] Give me your S3 for a sec.
[414.40 → 415.32] You have it on you, right?
[415.58 → 415.78] Yep.
[415.90 → 416.18] Whoa.
[416.76 → 417.54] Almost dropped it.
[417.84 → 421.82] So the S3 feels like, honestly, weight-wise, they're probably very similar.
[421.96 → 425.62] They haven't gone the iPhone 5 route where Apple basically went,
[425.62 → 430.16] Yep, we're going to make our phone weigh almost nothing, and it's going to feel like space age in your hand.
[430.26 → 432.16] Because you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, it doesn't weigh anything.
[432.16 → 437.32] Um, the, the S4 weighs about the same as the S3, just sort of holding them.
[437.52 → 440.80] But what it, it feels a little bit more solid.
[441.28 → 446.40] Um, I think part of it for me anyway is the fact that the sides are more square.
[446.74 → 450.00] I, I know you guys aren't going to be able to see this perfectly by any stretch of the imagination.
[450.00 → 455.06] But the S3 is very curved whereas the S4 has more of a flat side.
[455.06 → 462.50] And what I find is that for me personally, I'm able to, I'm able to hold it more naturally without it, without it slipping past me.
[462.56 → 469.20] This is one of the things I like about the HTC One where it has kind of a, a bit of a an edge on it.
[469.30 → 470.70] So you're less likely to drop it.
[470.78 → 474.94] For me, it's more natural to hold a device that has flat sides.
[474.94 → 480.38] So the, the ergonomic changes, although it's not really apparent in pictures, do make a difference.
[480.38 → 487.06] And it just feels a little bit more, more solid than, um, than what we've seen in the past from, from Samsung.
[487.06 → 489.94] And I'm including my experience with the S1 and the S2.
[490.16 → 490.40] Right.
[490.46 → 491.20] And the S3.
[491.34 → 491.50] Right.
[491.50 → 505.40] Um, another cool thing is, of course, you've got the swappable backplates, which is something the HTC One can't do, which gives you that micro SD expansion, the removable battery, as well as, uh, the, the option to change your backplate.
[505.40 → 512.52] So something like an HTC One, they're taking a very Apple-like approach where every HTC One will look the same, except silver or black.
[512.72 → 514.04] The battery's really beast though.
[514.14 → 519.34] One of the main things that I like about removable backplates is you can pretty much with every single removable backplate, you can change your battery.
[519.56 → 519.66] Yes.
[519.66 → 526.26] Um, and that's helpful in case your battery works or just sucks, but the HTC One's battery just seems...
[526.26 → 527.72] It seems to be just kind of awesome.
[527.84 → 529.72] Like what was that, you played music for how long?
[529.80 → 532.20] Yeah, for, um, like six hours that day.
[532.30 → 536.84] And then I had like 35% left at the end of the day, which is just kind of like on speakers, which is sort of ridiculous.
[536.88 → 537.62] And pretty loud.
[537.98 → 538.16] Yeah.
[538.24 → 540.86] Like it was easy to find him because I could just follow the music.
[541.56 → 542.20] It's like, okay.
[543.38 → 545.54] Um, so anyway, it feels more solid.
[545.54 → 549.02] Also, they have removable backs that are going to integrate wireless charging.
[549.02 → 552.94] Uh, which takes about three times longer than non-wireless charging.
[552.94 → 559.44] But from a convenience standpoint, honestly, if it wasn't so expensive, it's the kind of thing I'd look at and go, yeah, I'll buy like three of them.
[559.44 → 565.80] Um, and then just leave like one on my work desk, one on my nightstand and one in the car.
[565.90 → 566.42] I don't know.
[566.64 → 569.74] Like somewhere where you basically just put your phone down, don't think about it.
[569.78 → 571.90] And then it's charging, which is very cool.
[572.34 → 576.56] Um, honestly, it's kind of criminal what they're doing with the accessories as far as the front covers go.
[576.56 → 578.72] There's one that has a window, which is neat.
[578.72 → 578.92] Right.
[578.92 → 582.38] Because it uses magnets to know that that's the front cover you have on.
[582.52 → 587.22] And when you look at your phone, you can check notifications just through the window.
[587.32 → 590.14] And because it's an AMOLED screen, it doesn't have to light up the whole thing.
[590.18 → 592.16] So it just lights up that one little bit and conserves your battery.
[592.26 → 594.16] But they want an extra 20 bucks for the window version.
[594.56 → 595.36] And I'm like, really?
[595.44 → 596.64] $20 plastic window?
[596.90 → 599.12] They're just like, eh, well, okay.
[599.34 → 600.32] I thought it was just a cutout.
[600.40 → 601.66] I didn't even realize there's a plastic window.
[601.66 → 602.76] Oh, no, there's a plastic window.
[602.88 → 606.00] So it's like the premium, like, cutout option.
[606.62 → 609.80] But, um, S-Translate actually works.
[610.32 → 610.60] Yeah.
[610.72 → 612.06] Which I was floored by.
[612.38 → 614.64] Um, I was expecting it to be one of those, like...
[614.64 → 615.96] Diesel uses it from time to time.
[616.58 → 616.86] Yep.
[616.96 → 618.28] Works phenomenally well.
[618.34 → 619.42] I did a couple test runs.
[619.42 → 624.58] I don't speak French particularly well, but I can read rudimentary French pretty well.
[624.80 → 626.92] Like, enough to know, oh, yeah, that's what it says.
[627.26 → 630.36] Worked 100% with a couple test phrases that I did with it.
[630.36 → 634.36] Um, the new eye tracking scroll the page thing...
[635.28 → 636.20] Does it actually work really well?
[636.36 → 637.06] You know what?
[637.16 → 639.90] It's the kind of thing where I kind of looked at it and went, oh, yeah, this works.
[639.94 → 645.04] Because what it does is it locks onto your eyes, and then you tilt your head.
[646.06 → 647.34] Like this, to scroll the page.
[647.66 → 651.56] So it's the kind of thing where it takes probably about two and a half seconds to lock on.
[652.24 → 658.12] And then if you kind of go like this, your page is going to start going, woo, until it disengages.
[658.20 → 659.76] It's the kind of thing where I'm like, oh, yeah, it works.
[659.76 → 661.82] But would I use it?
[662.92 → 663.36] No.
[664.58 → 665.58] Probably not.
[666.18 → 667.60] What else did I want to talk about?
[667.88 → 668.64] Yeah, smart scrolling.
[668.74 → 669.00] That's one.
[669.22 → 669.66] Ah, yes.
[669.90 → 674.56] So the other one that was kind of like controlling it without touching the screen, where I looked at it and went, really?
[674.92 → 675.48] Does this matter?
[675.48 → 676.32] What else do I want to talk about?
[676.32 → 677.56] I would like to talk about the camera.
[677.56 → 677.64] Yeah.
[677.64 → 679.70] One of the things that I've done about that in the camera was the motion gestures.
[679.70 → 688.34] And I didn't obviously think about it enough, but it has a motion sensor in the front, which means instead of relying entirely on the front camera, which would be a huge battery hog, you can gesture at the camera.
[688.34 → 693.40] Say for example if you're in a meeting you can turn on a gesture where you put your hand over it
[693.40 → 698.68] And you kind of use the force, and it comes up with a little thing that tells you if you have any missed calls or missed messages or whatever else
[698.68 → 704.60] So being I mean obviously okay there's there are other gestures like you can go like this to change the track in your
[704.60 → 708.82] Actually no, no this was a good one I was about to make fun of this one but this one's good
[708.82 → 714.08] So if you're driving you put it in a cradle on your dash, and you go like this to change the song to the next track
[714.08 → 714.90] That's cool
[714.90 → 716.82] And I'm just like oh okay
[716.82 → 717.68] That's kind of nice
[717.68 → 725.56] Yeah and there's one to answer a call so it's its one of those things where I look at it and I go okay it's actually illegal to touch the device
[725.56 → 726.78] At least where we live
[726.78 → 728.48] So now you don't have to touch it
[728.48 → 729.96] Now you don't have to touch it
[729.96 → 731.44] You just kind of go in front of it
[731.44 → 731.88] Woo
[731.88 → 732.92] Woo
[732.92 → 736.94] It's like no officer I was just waving at my phone
[736.94 → 739.40] I talk with my hands
[739.40 → 740.04] Yes
[740.04 → 744.76] Whenever I talk, and I was talking to myself, so I had to wave in front of my phone
[744.76 → 749.80] Do you remember that uh do you remember that driver that we saw today?
[751.32 → 752.64] There was this woman
[752.64 → 753.44] Oh yeah
[753.44 → 754.64] That was bizarre
[754.64 → 755.36] What was she doing again?
[755.44 → 755.88] I don't remember
[755.88 → 760.00] I don't know what she was doing, but she was driving her car, and it's like one hand I think on the wheel
[760.00 → 761.02] Like at the bottom of the wheel
[761.02 → 762.56] And there are other arms like up like this
[762.56 → 762.88] Yeah
[762.88 → 764.20] And I'm like what?
[764.46 → 769.08] So it kind of looked like she was either sort of conducting the music she was listening to on the radio
[769.08 → 771.20] Or really getting into like an animated
[771.20 → 773.86] Aggressive conversation because she was kind of like
[773.86 → 774.28] Yeah
[774.28 → 776.32] On like a Bluetooth thing or something
[776.32 → 777.96] I was like what are you doing?
[778.50 → 780.52] You're operating a motor vehicle lady
[780.52 → 782.36] Like this
[782.36 → 784.34] 10 and 2 man
[784.34 → 785.70] Just make it happen
[785.70 → 786.94] Um
[786.94 → 788.12] Okay
[788.12 → 789.36] Well what else did I
[789.36 → 789.90] Oh yeah okay
[789.90 → 790.26] So
[790.26 → 791.54] Uh Touch ID is cool
[791.54 → 792.36] Because it
[792.36 → 796.02] It gets me away from having to use third party apps for
[796.02 → 796.80] I mean
[796.80 → 801.94] I think probably the big one that everyone really likes is the quick access to all your on and offs
[801.94 → 804.06] And like the third party apps are cool
[804.06 → 806.88] I'm using power toggles on my HTC One right now
[806.88 → 808.24] And you've got a bunch of options
[808.24 → 810.22] And you can have up to eight icons across the top
[810.22 → 816.00] But this one's kind of neat because it doesn't only control all the standard options like Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi
[816.00 → 818.70] But also things like S-beam, Smart Stay
[818.70 → 819.78] Um
[819.78 → 821.34] Smart Scroll
[821.34 → 822.30] Like the eye scrolling
[822.30 → 824.00] And then Smart Stay is the one where it
[824.00 → 824.30] Uh
[824.30 → 825.32] It doesn't
[825.32 → 825.70] Uh
[825.70 → 827.78] It doesn't dim the display if you're still looking at it
[827.78 → 828.40] All that kind of stuff
[828.40 → 829.78] So you can turn all that on and off
[829.78 → 830.58] At will
[830.58 → 831.98] They also include little tutorials
[831.98 → 833.24] Which I thought was cool
[833.24 → 835.34] For all the Samsung exclusive features
[835.34 → 836.44] Did you
[836.44 → 837.44] I just saw something
[837.44 → 837.78] Sorry
[837.78 → 838.78] Give me a sec guys
[838.78 → 839.90] Hold down
[839.90 → 840.40] Oh
[840.40 → 842.28] You had a huge bar of options
[842.28 → 843.68] What options
[843.68 → 844.12] Yeah
[844.12 → 844.80] Hey here
[844.80 → 846.02] Press that thing
[846.02 → 846.86] That's cool
[846.86 → 847.36] Yeah
[847.36 → 848.18] So anyway
[848.18 → 848.52] So yeah
[848.52 → 849.08] There's a huge
[849.08 → 851.46] All the options that you could possibly want
[851.46 → 852.74] There's a button on the top right
[852.74 → 854.12] And you can drop all the options
[854.12 → 856.84] So with my S3 and a bunch of other phones
[856.84 → 857.40] Currently
[857.40 → 858.42] Um
[858.42 → 860.74] You have to get another app
[860.74 → 861.74] If you want to do stuff like that
[861.74 → 861.96] Yeah
[861.96 → 862.42] So that's cool
[862.42 → 863.08] That comes by default
[863.08 → 863.28] Uh
[863.28 → 864.12] Their whole Knox thing
[864.12 → 865.16] Bring your device to work
[865.16 → 866.88] Is fully supported on this one
[866.88 → 868.78] I believe there was something that was S4 exclusive
[868.78 → 870.26] All my notes from the meeting are upstairs
[870.26 → 870.80] But uh
[870.80 → 871.24] Guys
[871.24 → 874.32] Expect me to do some videos on the S4 over the next little bit
[874.32 → 876.78] I'm going to an ASUS event next week
[876.78 → 881.06] We've got some really exciting projects we're working on for Tech Quickie right now
[881.06 → 882.62] That are taking up a lot of our time
[882.62 → 883.62] Um
[883.62 → 884.36] Oh man
[884.36 → 885.52] The one for the
[885.52 → 887.06] If you guys are following on Twitter
[887.06 → 888.90] You probably saw pictures of like
[888.90 → 891.76] This Frankenstein Funk MS3 mouse
[891.76 → 892.12] Can I
[892.12 → 893.50] I think it's on the counter
[893.50 → 893.92] It's right there
[893.92 → 894.92] Yeah do you want to run and grab it
[894.92 → 895.60] Because it's like
[895.60 → 897.30] Actually kind of awesome
[897.30 → 898.66] Um
[898.66 → 900.14] So
[900.14 → 900.72] So we
[900.72 → 902.42] We're working on a cool thing where
[902.42 → 904.00] The Funk MS3 mouse
[904.00 → 904.90] Is uh
[904.90 → 905.48] We're doing like
[905.48 → 906.62] The making of
[906.62 → 907.80] The Funk MS3
[907.80 → 908.70] And it's going to be kind of
[908.70 → 909.76] Obviously a parody
[909.76 → 910.34] Because
[910.34 → 911.20] Um
[911.20 → 912.54] No one at Linus Media Group
[912.54 → 913.24] Is actually
[913.24 → 914.88] On the Funk staff
[914.88 → 916.94] And responsible for making this mouse
[916.94 → 917.70] But uh
[917.70 → 919.72] It's the first time we've ever actually
[919.72 → 921.28] Brought in outside actors
[921.28 → 922.00] To come in
[922.00 → 923.56] And play roles in our videos
[923.56 → 924.36] And it's going to be
[924.36 → 925.82] Super professionally done
[925.82 → 927.00] So that's
[927.00 → 928.24] That's really, really exciting
[928.24 → 928.50] So
[928.50 → 929.32] I'm going to do some minor
[929.32 → 930.44] On the fly repairs
[930.44 → 932.34] Um
[932.34 → 933.52] She's
[933.52 → 935.48] She's falling apart a little bit
[935.48 → 936.68] Just hold it up
[936.68 → 937.32] And I'll have a look
[937.32 → 939.42] Wait
[939.42 → 939.90] Want to bring in a little
[939.90 → 940.92] It doesn't zoom that much
[940.92 → 941.18] Yeah
[941.18 → 942.54] Is it
[942.54 → 944.24] Oh
[944.24 → 944.76] Too close
[944.76 → 946.70] Less close
[946.70 → 948.32] Okay
[948.32 → 949.00] Do you want to take the
[949.00 → 949.68] Monte little tour
[949.68 → 950.50] Through the mouse
[950.50 → 951.36] Make sure you speak up
[951.36 → 952.18] Because the mic is behind you
[952.18 → 952.52] Alright
[952.52 → 953.96] So I added a bunch of
[953.96 → 954.82] Keycaps here
[954.82 → 956.02] Just random things
[956.02 → 957.16] Can you even see that very well
[957.16 → 957.46] It's okay
[957.46 → 957.88] I got it
[957.88 → 958.20] I got it
[958.20 → 958.92] Just random things
[958.92 → 959.80] That I thought might be
[959.80 → 961.04] Entirely not useful
[961.04 → 961.62] On a mouse
[961.62 → 962.60] Um
[962.60 → 962.84] So
[962.84 → 963.94] So I pried these off
[963.94 → 964.30] The keyboard
[964.30 → 965.16] And just kind of
[965.16 → 965.90] Stuck them to it
[965.90 → 967.10] You can see
[967.10 → 968.64] It's literally
[968.64 → 969.64] Just two-sided tape
[969.64 → 970.50] That's why I said
[970.50 → 971.00] I just had to do
[971.00 → 971.78] Some minor repairs
[971.78 → 972.50] Some of them had
[972.50 → 973.76] Completely fallen off
[973.76 → 974.38] And some were kind of
[974.38 → 975.24] Way off by a little bit
[975.24 → 975.72] Oh
[975.72 → 976.70] That fell off completely
[976.70 → 977.80] Um
[977.80 → 978.66] I stuck a few
[978.66 → 979.66] Random capacitors
[979.66 → 980.44] On top of this
[980.44 → 981.60] On the right side
[981.60 → 982.00] Of the click
[982.00 → 983.28] And then this had
[983.28 → 984.32] A little circuit board
[984.32 → 984.98] That had a cable
[984.98 → 985.90] Running back to the
[985.90 → 986.40] Mouse wheel
[986.40 → 987.08] Which is kind of
[987.08 → 987.96] Zombified on the back
[987.96 → 988.36] As well
[988.36 → 989.56] There's another cable
[989.56 → 990.66] Running along here
[990.66 → 992.32] And then Linus and I
[992.32 → 993.38] Shove just a bunch
[993.38 → 993.98] More keys
[993.98 → 994.82] On this side
[994.82 → 996.26] So there's more thumb keys
[996.26 → 996.54] Here
[996.54 → 997.26] More thumb keys
[997.26 → 997.60] Here
[997.60 → 998.76] And then this one
[998.76 → 999.20] At the bottom
[999.20 → 1000.06] Is actually stock
[1000.06 → 1001.42] And we added another
[1001.42 → 1002.28] Key right here
[1002.28 → 1003.70] So there's actually
[1003.70 → 1004.70] A ton of zombification
[1004.70 → 1005.18] On this
[1005.18 → 1006.68] I wish this right here
[1006.68 → 1007.42] Was still there
[1007.42 → 1008.50] Because that was
[1008.50 → 1009.24] Actually really cool
[1009.24 → 1010.08] There's a little circuit board
[1010.08 → 1010.72] That ran a cable
[1010.72 → 1011.50] Into the back here
[1011.50 → 1012.30] And it looks quite cool
[1012.30 → 1012.66] I'm not sure
[1012.66 → 1013.14] Where that went
[1013.14 → 1014.64] But we were just using
[1014.64 → 1015.50] Double-sided tape
[1015.50 → 1015.86] For everything
[1015.86 → 1016.98] So it kind of fell off
[1016.98 → 1018.68] But yeah
[1018.68 → 1019.34] There's our
[1019.34 → 1020.34] There's our custom
[1020.34 → 1021.96] Linus Tech Tips edition
[1021.96 → 1023.22] Funk mouse
[1023.22 → 1024.52] So
[1024.52 → 1025.42] Have a seat
[1025.42 → 1026.36] I can't fix the focus
[1026.36 → 1027.08] Until you're there
[1027.08 → 1027.98] Take from that
[1027.98 → 1028.56] What you will
[1028.56 → 1030.46] Is there anything else
[1030.46 → 1031.04] We can even say
[1031.04 → 1031.76] About that project
[1031.76 → 1035.16] Other than the video
[1035.16 → 1035.80] Should be awesome
[1035.80 → 1036.96] Yeah
[1036.96 → 1039.14] The video will be awesome
[1039.14 → 1040.86] I was pretty amused
[1040.86 → 1041.60] That I had a couple
[1041.60 → 1042.42] People on Twitter
[1042.42 → 1043.28] That seemed to think
[1043.28 → 1044.30] That the mouse was real
[1044.30 → 1044.90] Yeah
[1044.90 → 1045.76] And were actually
[1045.76 → 1046.56] Giving their feedback
[1046.56 → 1047.56] On it as a product
[1047.56 → 1048.36] Like oh you know
[1048.36 → 1048.80] I don't know
[1048.80 → 1049.42] If I'd use that
[1049.42 → 1049.90] Or oh man
[1049.90 → 1050.66] I'd totally buy that
[1050.66 → 1050.92] No, no
[1050.92 → 1052.30] That's not an actual product
[1052.30 → 1053.24] It was just
[1053.24 → 1054.06] It was just a joke
[1054.06 → 1054.90] I told you
[1054.90 → 1056.16] You made it too real looking
[1056.16 → 1058.10] Yeah
[1058.10 → 1058.78] Because I told him
[1058.78 → 1059.50] To make it stupid
[1059.50 → 1060.92] And he actually put
[1060.92 → 1061.98] Like a bunch of stuff
[1061.98 → 1062.90] That was actually
[1062.90 → 1063.58] Looked like it could
[1063.58 → 1064.54] Possibly be useful
[1064.54 → 1065.18] I was like
[1065.18 → 1065.92] I was like
[1065.92 → 1066.50] Really
[1066.50 → 1067.74] But it looks good
[1067.74 → 1068.36] I know
[1068.36 → 1069.76] It looks good enough
[1069.76 → 1070.42] That people thought
[1070.42 → 1071.58] That it was an actual product
[1071.58 → 1073.14] So that should be
[1073.14 → 1073.66] That should be all
[1073.66 → 1074.16] You need to know
[1074.16 → 1076.84] We are going to move
[1076.84 → 1077.42] The live stream
[1077.42 → 1078.42] Yeah
[1078.42 → 1079.04] Yeah
[1079.04 → 1080.54] So the Friday
[1080.54 → 1082.04] The Friday nighttime slot
[1082.04 → 1083.32] This will be the last one
[1083.32 → 1083.94] We are moving
[1083.94 → 1084.78] The live stream
[1084.78 → 1088.02] To our Monday afternoons
[1088.02 → 1088.78] Probably at around
[1088.78 → 1089.58] Four o'clock
[1089.58 → 1090.86] So the rationale
[1090.86 → 1091.58] For this
[1091.58 → 1092.78] Is that
[1092.78 → 1093.48] It'll be
[1093.48 → 1095.16] It'll be
[1095.16 → 1095.90] Night time
[1095.90 → 1096.72] In Europe
[1096.72 → 1098.36] It will be
[1098.36 → 1099.92] Kind of like
[1099.92 → 1101.00] Evening
[1101.00 → 1102.04] In eastern
[1102.04 → 1102.76] North America
[1102.76 → 1104.66] And it will be
[1104.66 → 1105.58] I believe
[1105.58 → 1106.48] What morning
[1106.48 → 1107.48] In Australia
[1107.48 → 1109.90] And that is where
[1109.90 → 1111.02] Most of our viewers
[1111.02 → 1111.70] Come from
[1111.70 → 1112.68] I mean
[1112.68 → 1113.06] Look
[1113.06 → 1113.66] I'm
[1113.66 → 1114.18] Okay
[1114.18 → 1115.44] For all of those of you
[1115.44 → 1116.30] Who are not
[1116.30 → 1117.06] In those areas
[1117.06 → 1118.74] I am incredibly sorry
[1118.74 → 1120.46] But the numbers
[1120.46 → 1121.18] Are the numbers
[1121.18 → 1122.16] And we do see
[1122.16 → 1122.68] The numbers
[1122.68 → 1123.96] And so we have to go
[1123.96 → 1125.38] With a time slot
[1125.38 → 1126.54] That A works best
[1126.54 → 1127.42] For the majority
[1127.42 → 1128.02] Of the viewers
[1128.02 → 1129.38] And B works a little
[1129.38 → 1130.10] Better for us
[1130.10 → 1131.76] Because honestly
[1131.76 → 1132.70] At the end
[1132.70 → 1133.48] Of the week
[1133.48 → 1134.60] It's pretty tough
[1134.60 → 1135.12] To do these
[1135.12 → 1135.84] Friday night
[1135.84 → 1137.16] Late night live streams
[1137.16 → 1137.58] And I'm sure
[1137.58 → 1138.02] He's getting
[1138.02 → 1139.16] The look on his face
[1139.16 → 1139.98] He's getting destroyed
[1139.98 → 1140.68] In the twitch chat
[1140.68 → 1141.10] Right now
[1141.10 → 1141.88] I'm sorry
[1141.88 → 1143.26] Guys
[1143.26 → 1143.86] There's nothing
[1143.86 → 1144.78] We can do about it
[1144.78 → 1145.84] To be perfectly honest
[1145.84 → 1146.26] I mean
[1146.26 → 1146.88] It's
[1146.88 → 1148.28] My wife's going
[1148.28 → 1148.84] Back to work
[1148.84 → 1149.58] She's been on
[1149.58 → 1150.20] Maternity leave
[1150.20 → 1150.72] With the baby
[1150.72 → 1152.34] So I can't do them
[1152.34 → 1153.06] On Fridays anymore
[1153.06 → 1153.78] Actually like
[1153.78 → 1154.08] Period
[1154.08 → 1154.84] Cannot
[1154.84 → 1155.42] And evenings
[1155.42 → 1156.36] Don't really work anymore
[1156.36 → 1156.84] So
[1156.84 → 1158.40] Yeah
[1158.40 → 1160.76] Yeah
[1160.76 → 1163.14] I'm sorry guys
[1163.14 → 1164.50] There's a lot of people
[1164.50 → 1165.52] I've said in twitch chat
[1165.52 → 1166.14] I know
[1166.14 → 1166.74] I know
[1166.74 → 1168.12] And I totally understand
[1168.12 → 1169.96] But I mean
[1169.96 → 1171.14] I always said
[1171.14 → 1172.00] This time slot
[1172.00 → 1172.60] Was temporary
[1172.60 → 1173.82] And that it was
[1173.82 → 1174.50] Going to be moved
[1174.50 → 1175.04] From like
[1175.04 → 1175.84] The very first
[1175.84 → 1176.64] Or second one
[1176.64 → 1178.02] And it lasted
[1178.02 → 1178.72] A long time
[1178.72 → 1179.86] But we will have
[1179.86 → 1180.30] To move it
[1180.30 → 1180.96] But we will still
[1180.96 → 1182.00] Be uploading the archives
[1182.00 → 1182.68] To YouTube
[1182.68 → 1183.92] Speaking of YouTube
[1183.92 → 1185.20] We are now activated
[1185.20 → 1186.66] As a twitch
[1186.66 → 1187.30] YouTube
[1187.30 → 1189.00] Networked partner
[1189.00 → 1189.68] So it finally
[1189.68 → 1190.40] Went through
[1190.40 → 1191.52] And that's done
[1191.52 → 1192.02] So apparently
[1192.02 → 1193.42] That's actually
[1193.42 → 1195.50] Like
[1195.50 → 1197.42] Because before
[1197.42 → 1197.80] Sorry
[1197.80 → 1198.60] Just completely
[1198.60 → 1199.24] Jumping away
[1199.24 → 1199.72] From what
[1199.72 → 1200.34] You were just
[1200.34 → 1200.94] Talking about
[1200.94 → 1202.16] Life stream timing
[1202.16 → 1202.70] In Australia
[1202.70 → 1203.34] Is like
[1203.34 → 1204.36] Not so good
[1204.36 → 1204.80] On Monday
[1204.80 → 1205.80] Or I guess
[1205.80 → 1206.08] That would be
[1206.08 → 1206.86] Tuesday morning
[1206.86 → 1207.38] Right when people
[1207.38 → 1207.82] Go to school
[1207.82 → 1208.16] And work
[1208.16 → 1209.40] Because right now
[1209.40 → 1209.94] It makes it
[1209.94 → 1210.56] Saturday morning
[1210.56 → 1210.96] For them
[1210.96 → 1212.28] Right
[1212.28 → 1214.54] Anyway
[1214.54 → 1215.74] It's not like
[1215.74 → 1216.24] We really have
[1216.24 → 1216.66] A choice
[1216.66 → 1217.64] I mean
[1217.64 → 1218.14] Yeah
[1218.14 → 1218.76] We actually
[1218.76 → 1219.16] Don't have
[1219.16 → 1219.50] A choice
[1219.50 → 1219.98] At this point
[1219.98 → 1221.02] If we could
[1221.02 → 1221.62] Do it on a
[1221.62 → 1221.92] Friday
[1221.92 → 1222.60] That would have
[1222.60 → 1223.06] Been better
[1223.06 → 1224.32] But the problem
[1224.32 → 1224.98] Is that
[1224.98 → 1225.82] You know
[1225.82 → 1226.72] Slick's love life
[1226.72 → 1227.46] Has really started
[1227.46 → 1228.18] To take off
[1228.18 → 1230.86] And all the ladies
[1230.86 → 1231.78] That watch our show
[1231.78 → 1232.42] Have been
[1232.42 → 1233.48] Lining up
[1233.48 → 1234.08] To get a date
[1234.08 → 1234.52] With him
[1234.52 → 1235.98] So if you want
[1235.98 → 1236.70] His plenty of fish
[1236.70 → 1237.20] Profile
[1237.20 → 1240.52] Now people are
[1240.52 → 1240.84] Going to go
[1240.84 → 1241.62] On a wild man
[1241.62 → 1242.34] Hunt for some
[1242.34 → 1243.26] Plenty of fish
[1243.26 → 1243.64] Yeah, and they're
[1243.64 → 1244.18] Totally going to
[1244.18 → 1244.62] Find it
[1244.62 → 1245.30] I'm sorry dude
[1245.30 → 1246.24] I don't have one
[1246.24 → 1246.92] Yeah
[1246.92 → 1248.96] That's what he says
[1248.96 → 1249.58] You're terrible
[1249.58 → 1250.00] At winking
[1250.00 → 1250.66] Huh
[1250.66 → 1251.44] That was terrible
[1251.44 → 1253.28] You're terrible
[1253.28 → 1253.84] At winking
[1253.84 → 1257.16] We can't all be
[1257.16 → 1258.08] Talented at everything
[1258.08 → 1259.38] Oh man
[1259.38 → 1260.26] I have other talents
[1260.26 → 1261.08] That make up for it
[1261.08 → 1262.64] You wouldn't understand
[1262.64 → 1263.42] I'll tell you about it
[1263.42 → 1263.82] When you're older
[1263.82 → 1270.48] Oh god
[1270.48 → 1271.74] That's horrible
[1271.74 → 1272.24] Yeah I'm sorry
[1272.24 → 1273.88] So Nvidia is going
[1273.88 → 1274.50] To be giving away
[1274.50 → 1275.68] Metro Last Light
[1275.68 → 1277.36] With GTX 660 and up
[1277.36 → 1278.06] Yeah
[1278.06 → 1279.36] The arms race
[1279.36 → 1280.70] Of free video games
[1280.70 → 1281.50] With graphics cards
[1281.50 → 1282.02] Is just
[1282.02 → 1283.86] Getting pretty heated
[1283.86 → 1285.22] And isn't it about time
[1285.22 → 1285.90] Yeah
[1285.90 → 1286.80] I mean how long
[1286.80 → 1287.38] Was it that we were
[1287.38 → 1287.86] Getting like
[1287.86 → 1289.56] John Woo's Stranglehold
[1289.56 → 1291.02] And like
[1291.02 → 1291.70] Some like
[1291.70 → 1292.42] Racing game
[1292.42 → 1293.34] That no one cares about
[1293.34 → 1293.68] I'm like
[1293.68 → 1294.90] Come on you guys
[1294.90 → 1296.02] Where are the
[1296.02 → 1296.94] AAA titles
[1296.94 → 1298.10] It was more
[1298.10 → 1298.90] Back then it was more
[1298.90 → 1299.50] Like what game
[1299.50 → 1300.48] Isn't going to sell
[1300.48 → 1301.14] So we don't have to
[1301.14 → 1301.88] Worry about these people
[1301.88 → 1303.02] Not actually buying it
[1303.02 → 1303.56] Anyway
[1303.56 → 1304.86] So we can give it to them
[1304.86 → 1305.64] For free, and it won't
[1305.64 → 1306.38] Reduce our sales
[1306.38 → 1307.72] And it won't actually matter
[1307.72 → 1308.40] Because no one will
[1308.40 → 1309.62] Actually care
[1309.62 → 1310.84] And I'm tired of that
[1310.84 → 1311.38] Mentality
[1311.38 → 1312.56] This is great
[1312.56 → 1313.68] Rewarding people for
[1313.68 → 1314.38] Buying the hardware
[1314.38 → 1315.28] By giving them something
[1315.28 → 1315.84] To actually play
[1315.84 → 1316.72] With that said
[1316.72 → 1318.24] I mean Nvidia's
[1318.24 → 1320.08] Usual MO is
[1320.08 → 1321.68] Sort of one game bundle
[1321.68 → 1323.58] Every quarter or so
[1323.58 → 1327.66] And as much as
[1327.66 → 1328.68] Metro Last Light
[1328.68 → 1329.98] Is going to be a huge title
[1329.98 → 1330.70] That's going to be
[1330.70 → 1331.54] A huge deal
[1331.54 → 1332.84] I don't
[1332.84 → 1333.86] I don't really see it
[1333.86 → 1335.22] As that much of a response
[1335.22 → 1335.82] To AMD's
[1335.82 → 1336.54] Never Settle strategy
[1336.54 → 1336.88] No
[1336.88 → 1338.22] It's still a little bit
[1338.22 → 1338.88] More aggressive than
[1338.88 → 1339.78] Some things I've done
[1339.78 → 1340.22] In the past
[1340.22 → 1340.84] Assassin's Creed
[1340.84 → 1341.58] Was kind of huge
[1341.58 → 1342.06] Yep
[1342.06 → 1342.60] Batman
[1342.60 → 1343.10] Batman
[1343.10 → 1343.84] Was pretty epic
[1343.84 → 1344.86] Batman Arkham Asylum
[1344.86 → 1345.80] Borderlands 2
[1345.80 → 1347.30] They've actually been
[1347.30 → 1348.44] On not a bad run
[1348.44 → 1349.44] They've been ramping up
[1349.44 → 1350.70] Of AAA titles
[1350.70 → 1351.00] Yep
[1351.00 → 1352.24] But then AMD's
[1352.24 → 1352.58] Like
[1352.58 → 1353.04] So
[1353.04 → 1353.84] Like
[1353.84 → 1355.98] Nine times A
[1355.98 → 1357.28] Like we'll give you
[1357.28 → 1358.92] Three AAA titles
[1358.92 → 1359.80] Don't worry about it
[1359.80 → 1360.68] And then they're like
[1360.68 → 1361.30] Oh yeah you bought
[1361.30 → 1361.86] Some stuff before
[1361.86 → 1362.34] Don't worry about
[1362.34 → 1362.82] Blood Dragon
[1362.82 → 1363.26] Yeah
[1363.26 → 1363.60] It's cool
[1363.60 → 1364.28] Here you go
[1364.28 → 1364.88] Here you go
[1364.88 → 1365.46] What
[1365.46 → 1366.56] So I mean
[1366.56 → 1367.82] AMD's just been
[1367.82 → 1368.70] Crushing it
[1368.70 → 1369.34] When it's come to
[1369.34 → 1369.96] Free games
[1369.96 → 1371.26] Speaking of AMD
[1371.26 → 1372.32] Our 7990
[1372.32 → 1373.24] Should be in transit
[1373.24 → 1373.90] In theory
[1373.90 → 1375.30] So
[1375.30 → 1376.50] Hopefully we're gonna
[1376.50 → 1377.28] Have some videos
[1377.28 → 1378.46] For you guys
[1378.46 → 1379.06] At launch
[1379.06 → 1380.02] Of 7990
[1380.02 → 1381.24] Which should be part
[1381.24 → 1381.70] Of the current
[1381.70 → 1382.24] Never Settle
[1382.24 → 1382.78] Which I think
[1382.78 → 1383.60] Includes
[1383.60 → 1385.58] Is it Bios hock Infinite
[1385.58 → 1386.10] Right now
[1386.10 → 1386.98] And something
[1386.98 → 1388.52] Can't remember anymore
[1388.52 → 1389.36] But
[1389.36 → 1389.84] But anyway
[1389.84 → 1390.34] There you go
[1390.34 → 1391.48] So Metro Last Light
[1391.48 → 1392.64] Is going
[1392.64 → 1393.46] And that's cool
[1393.46 → 1394.54] So I'm going to go
[1394.54 → 1395.58] Adjust that camera again
[1395.58 → 1396.50] Because it sort of
[1396.50 → 1397.14] Is funny
[1397.14 → 1398.38] You're kind of there
[1398.38 → 1399.18] And I'm kind of here
[1399.18 → 1399.84] And then there's like
[1399.84 → 1400.26] Woo
[1400.26 → 1401.52] Lots of space over here
[1401.52 → 1402.72] So I want to introduce
[1402.72 → 1404.14] Find one of your
[1404.14 → 1404.76] Cool topics
[1404.76 → 1406.08] That you supposedly
[1406.08 → 1406.66] Contributed
[1406.66 → 1407.58] How do I even
[1407.58 → 1408.76] I don't have control
[1408.76 → 1409.16] Of this
[1409.16 → 1409.64] Oh yeah
[1409.64 → 1410.22] Where's the thing
[1410.22 → 1410.74] I always
[1410.74 → 1411.04] Here
[1411.04 → 1412.28] Of course it's on here
[1412.28 → 1413.60] Whatever
[1413.60 → 1416.80] This keyboard's so small
[1416.80 → 1418.84] Tiny baby hands
[1418.84 → 1420.16] That's an inside joke
[1420.16 → 1420.86] People won't understand
[1420.86 → 1421.32] For a while
[1421.32 → 1423.18] Um
[1423.18 → 1424.72] Judge
[1424.72 → 1425.70] Vote
[1425.70 → 1426.34] Vote
[1426.34 → 1427.08] I'm not sure
[1427.08 → 1427.82] How to pronounce this
[1427.82 → 1429.28] Judge something
[1429.28 → 1430.18] Held himself
[1430.18 → 1430.86] Held himself in contempt
[1430.86 → 1432.02] And paid $25
[1432.02 → 1432.94] For his infraction
[1432.94 → 1433.88] So basically what happened
[1433.88 → 1434.98] Was he had a new smartphone
[1434.98 → 1436.40] And he started shouting out
[1436.40 → 1437.00] Voice commands
[1437.00 → 1438.08] While he was holding court
[1438.08 → 1440.28] And instead of being like
[1440.28 → 1440.68] Oh yeah
[1440.68 → 1441.50] It doesn't matter
[1441.50 → 1442.44] I'm the judge
[1442.44 → 1443.66] It doesn't matter
[1443.66 → 1444.04] I can
[1444.04 → 1444.96] Like I can
[1444.96 → 1446.28] Screw other people over for that
[1446.28 → 1446.76] But nope
[1446.76 → 1447.36] It's fine
[1447.36 → 1449.12] He held himself in contempt
[1449.12 → 1449.96] And charged himself
[1449.96 → 1450.38] $25
[1450.38 → 1451.32] That's awesome
[1451.32 → 1452.16] Well
[1452.16 → 1454.32] That shouldn't be an anomaly
[1454.32 → 1455.98] And that should actually
[1455.98 → 1456.78] Just kind of be
[1456.78 → 1457.78] What happens all the time
[1457.78 → 1459.16] You can correct yourself
[1459.16 → 1459.50] It's fine
[1459.50 → 1460.14] I'm leaning over
[1460.14 → 1461.20] So it'll help a little bit
[1461.20 → 1461.98] Yeah, thank you
[1461.98 → 1462.58] Um
[1462.58 → 1465.02] It doesn't always
[1465.02 → 1465.86] Kind of happen that way
[1465.86 → 1466.86] People don't always
[1466.86 → 1467.84] Kind of hold themselves
[1467.84 → 1468.26] At fault
[1468.26 → 1469.02] If they actually do
[1469.02 → 1469.58] Something wrong
[1469.58 → 1470.50] There's a good chance
[1470.50 → 1471.72] I wouldn't even think of it
[1471.72 → 1472.78] If I was
[1472.78 → 1473.82] If I was that guy
[1473.82 → 1474.84] Like
[1474.84 → 1476.30] I'd just be like
[1476.30 → 1477.10] Oh crap my phone
[1477.10 → 1477.98] Oh oops bloop
[1477.98 → 1478.58] Yeah
[1478.58 → 1479.24] Put it away
[1479.24 → 1479.94] But nope
[1479.94 → 1480.98] Held himself in contempt
[1480.98 → 1482.14] Paid up $25
[1482.14 → 1484.14] I think it's pretty cool
[1484.14 → 1485.02] It's actually really cool
[1485.02 → 1485.54] And like
[1485.54 → 1487.00] The internet's in love with him
[1487.00 → 1487.80] He probably gained
[1487.80 → 1490.22] A huge amount of respect
[1490.22 → 1491.32] That's a worth way more than $25
[1491.32 → 1492.50] Yeah more than $25
[1492.50 → 1493.08] I mean
[1493.08 → 1494.08] And you
[1494.08 → 1495.76] Like you contrast this
[1495.76 → 1496.64] With the
[1496.64 → 1498.48] Millions and millions of dollars
[1498.48 → 1500.24] That have made their way to
[1500.24 → 1501.54] Somewhere
[1501.54 → 1502.92] To get CISA
[1502.92 → 1504.30] Pushed through
[1504.30 → 1505.08] And you're just kind of
[1505.08 → 1505.54] Looking at it
[1505.54 → 1505.98] Going like
[1505.98 → 1506.60] Oh
[1506.60 → 1507.08] You know
[1507.08 → 1507.48] You have to
[1507.48 → 1509.18] I mean it seems like
[1509.18 → 1511.16] There's so few people in power
[1511.16 → 1511.84] Who actually
[1511.84 → 1513.32] Try to play by their own rules
[1513.32 → 1514.72] That you just have to kind of
[1514.72 → 1516.02] Whenever one person does it
[1516.02 → 1516.32] It's like
[1516.32 → 1517.04] Oh cool
[1517.04 → 1517.54] Oh
[1517.54 → 1518.06] Yeah
[1518.06 → 1518.96] That doesn't happen
[1518.96 → 1520.10] It's like an oddity
[1520.10 → 1520.72] Which it
[1520.72 → 1521.98] It shouldn't be
[1521.98 → 1522.26] But
[1522.26 → 1523.84] But it just kind of is
[1523.84 → 1524.74] But it just kind of is
[1524.74 → 1525.06] So
[1525.06 → 1527.88] That's both awesome
[1527.88 → 1528.48] And depressing
[1528.48 → 1529.50] Today
[1529.50 → 1531.54] All right
[1531.54 → 1531.88] What you got
[1531.88 → 1532.38] What else you got
[1532.38 → 1534.66] Should we do some Twitter Q&A
[1534.66 → 1535.82] Yeah we should do
[1535.82 → 1536.68] We're half an hour in
[1536.68 → 1538.14] We've done zero Twitter Q&A
[1538.14 → 1539.08] I'm sorry you guys
[1539.08 → 1540.96] Should we take
[1540.96 → 1541.94] Um
[1541.94 → 1543.04] Ah
[1543.04 → 1543.48] No
[1543.48 → 1544.30] Talk about it later
[1544.30 → 1545.42] Hey
[1545.42 → 1546.82] This leads into the topic
[1546.82 → 1547.40] That you had
[1547.40 → 1547.68] Okay
[1547.68 → 1549.72] We will talk about PAX in a bit
[1549.72 → 1550.36] Um
[1550.36 → 1551.08] Yeah
[1551.08 → 1551.98] There's apparently
[1551.98 → 1553.18] You know what
[1553.18 → 1553.86] Let's talk about it now
[1553.86 → 1554.36] Okay
[1554.36 → 1556.30] So much for Twitter Q&A
[1556.30 → 1557.94] So PAX Prime
[1557.94 → 1559.50] Sells out fast
[1559.50 → 1559.78] What was it
[1559.78 → 1560.30] 20 minutes
[1560.30 → 1561.62] The PAX Prime
[1561.62 → 1562.38] Four day passes
[1562.38 → 1563.28] The four-day tickets
[1563.28 → 1564.52] Sold out in about
[1564.52 → 1565.58] I don't know
[1565.58 → 1566.56] I don't think anyone
[1566.56 → 1568.48] Actually knows the actual time
[1568.48 → 1569.48] Because of just
[1569.48 → 1570.76] How airbrushed it got
[1570.76 → 1572.16] The tweet
[1572.16 → 1573.00] From
[1573.00 → 1573.98] Um
[1573.98 → 1575.16] From
[1575.16 → 1576.36] PAX Prime
[1576.36 → 1577.98] Went out 23 minutes later
[1577.98 → 1579.26] But there's no
[1579.26 → 1580.30] Way
[1580.30 → 1581.58] That they tweeted that out
[1581.58 → 1582.92] Anywhere near the actual time
[1582.92 → 1583.58] Right
[1583.58 → 1584.70] So it was probably like
[1584.70 → 1585.72] Five ten minutes
[1585.72 → 1587.12] Unbelievable
[1587.12 → 1587.88] After announcements
[1587.88 → 1588.96] That four days sold out
[1588.96 → 1590.70] The final ticket was sold
[1590.70 → 1591.82] Just under six hours
[1591.82 → 1592.48] After announcement
[1592.48 → 1593.12] But those
[1593.12 → 1594.00] Like
[1594.00 → 1595.68] I think it was an hour
[1595.68 → 1596.90] After announcement
[1596.90 → 1597.78] All that was left
[1597.78 → 1599.30] Was Monday only badges
[1599.30 → 1600.72] And they moved this year
[1600.72 → 1601.44] To four days
[1601.44 → 1603.40] So it's like
[1603.40 → 1604.24] The last day
[1604.24 → 1604.90] Where some people
[1604.90 → 1605.42] Have to like
[1605.42 → 1606.36] Go back to work
[1606.36 → 1606.98] And stuff
[1606.98 → 1607.86] Right
[1607.86 → 1608.86] So it's like
[1608.86 → 1610.32] Yeah that one's obviously
[1610.32 → 1611.16] Not going to sell out
[1611.16 → 1612.36] As fast as the other stuff
[1612.36 → 1614.24] So it's kind of ridiculous
[1614.24 → 1615.32] Um
[1615.32 → 1616.52] We know nothing about
[1616.52 → 1617.20] Media badges
[1617.20 → 1619.58] We know nothing about
[1619.58 → 1620.06] Media badges
[1620.06 → 1620.80] I haven't seen anything
[1620.80 → 1621.86] Go up about media badges
[1621.86 → 1623.08] I have a badge
[1623.08 → 1625.32] Cool
[1625.32 → 1626.34] So Slick will be doing
[1626.34 → 1627.18] Our entire Linus
[1627.18 → 1628.18] Media Group coverage
[1628.18 → 1629.52] Of PAX Prime
[1629.52 → 1630.70] Single handedly
[1630.70 → 1632.20] This will be my ninth year
[1632.20 → 1633.30] I will expect you to hold
[1633.30 → 1634.36] The camera in front of yourself
[1634.36 → 1634.86] Like this
[1634.86 → 1635.26] And be like
[1635.26 → 1636.18] The FS
[1636.18 → 1639.98] I don't think my duck lips
[1639.98 → 1640.96] Would really work that well
[1640.96 → 1641.56] If you shaved
[1641.56 → 1642.14] It might help
[1642.14 → 1642.80] If I shaved
[1642.80 → 1643.12] Because like
[1643.12 → 1643.94] Furry duck lips
[1643.94 → 1644.60] Is even worse
[1644.60 → 1646.42] Than regular duck lips
[1646.42 → 1647.52] Furry
[1647.52 → 1648.38] Furry duck lips
[1648.38 → 1649.02] Furry duck lips
[1649.02 → 1650.36] It's like
[1650.36 → 1651.74] No
[1651.74 → 1652.48] That's horrible
[1652.48 → 1653.92] Come on let's see
[1653.92 → 1654.42] No
[1654.42 → 1655.20] Give us your best friend
[1655.20 → 1655.58] Come on
[1655.58 → 1655.80] No
[1655.80 → 1656.64] You have to be a support
[1656.64 → 1657.04] For the lives
[1657.04 → 1657.88] I can't
[1657.88 → 1658.58] I can't do it
[1658.58 → 1660.18] 2,200 people tuned in
[1660.18 → 1661.46] To watch you do furry duck lips
[1661.46 → 1662.28] 2,200 people do not
[1662.28 → 1663.92] Want to see furry duck lips
[1663.92 → 1664.48] You know what
[1664.48 → 1665.56] Twitch chat
[1665.56 → 1666.76] Let us know
[1666.76 → 1667.34] Let's see
[1667.34 → 1667.98] Let's see
[1667.98 → 1668.68] Let us know
[1668.68 → 1669.36] If you'd like to see
[1669.36 → 1670.20] Slick's furry duck lips
[1670.20 → 1670.72] Do not
[1670.72 → 1671.74] Ducks die
[1671.74 → 1672.18] Do it
[1672.18 → 1672.42] Do it
[1672.42 → 1672.68] Do it
[1672.68 → 1673.18] Do it
[1673.18 → 1673.74] Do it
[1673.74 → 1674.02] Do it
[1674.02 → 1674.30] Do it
[1674.30 → 1674.52] Do it
[1674.52 → 1674.74] Slick
[1674.74 → 1675.40] Please do it
[1675.40 → 1675.66] Do it
[1675.66 → 1675.86] Yes
[1675.86 → 1676.26] Duck lips
[1676.26 → 1676.50] Do it
[1676.50 → 1676.70] Do it
[1676.70 → 1676.96] Come on
[1676.96 → 1677.28] Let's go
[1677.28 → 1677.68] Here we go
[1677.68 → 1678.28] No
[1678.28 → 1679.36] I saw one no
[1679.36 → 1681.04] I saw one no
[1681.04 → 1681.56] That's not good enough
[1681.56 → 1684.70] That man speaks for the entirety of humanity right now
[1684.70 → 1685.18] Could be a lady
[1685.18 → 1688.90] That person speaks for
[1688.90 → 1690.06] If it's a lady
[1690.06 → 1692.06] Her viewership should count more
[1692.06 → 1694.10] Because we have less of them
[1694.10 → 1699.90] That's more like fish
[1699.90 → 1704.42] My laptop I just turned off
[1704.42 → 1705.24] I don't want to
[1705.24 → 1706.16] I don't want to
[1706.16 → 1707.14] Oh what a poor sport
[1707.14 → 1707.42] No way
[1707.42 → 1709.24] Anyway, so PAX Prime sold out
[1709.24 → 1712.20] And we have no idea what's going on
[1712.20 → 1714.26] As far as whether we'll be able to be there or not
[1714.26 → 1715.46] So there you go
[1715.46 → 1721.34] We were really expecting to at least have some information about media passes
[1721.34 → 1722.76] Even PAX East this year
[1722.76 → 1723.62] There was
[1723.62 → 1724.96] They talked about it a lot more
[1724.96 → 1726.28] I might have missed something
[1726.28 → 1727.66] I've been looking for it quite a bit
[1727.66 → 1729.52] I know PAX East it was fairly transparent
[1729.52 → 1731.54] I haven't seen anything yet about PAX Prime
[1731.54 → 1734.74] If you have seen something please message me on the forum
[1734.74 → 1735.74] So we can figure that out
[1735.74 → 1736.82] Sure yeah let us know
[1736.82 → 1738.42] Because I totally might have missed something
[1738.42 → 1740.06] Okay here we go
[1740.06 → 1745.20] Apparently Northern Lion LP and Linus Tech will be streaming at the same time on Mondays
[1745.20 → 1747.68] I'm sorry to hear that
[1747.68 → 1748.80] That's bad
[1748.80 → 1751.40] We might have to look into this live stream time
[1751.40 → 1751.92] Yeah
[1751.92 → 1752.28] More
[1752.28 → 1753.98] I mean we haven't completely decided
[1753.98 → 1757.40] It's just that looks like the time that will actually work for us
[1757.40 → 1759.10] We can't do late Friday nights anymore
[1759.10 → 1759.28] Yeah
[1759.28 → 1761.08] That is not actually a possibility
[1761.08 → 1761.58] That's done
[1761.58 → 1762.86] Done
[1762.86 → 1763.16] As of this
[1763.16 → 1766.76] So next Friday there won't be a live stream at all
[1766.76 → 1769.34] Next week there won't be a live stream at all
[1769.34 → 1772.48] And the following week we will kick off our new live stream time
[1772.48 → 1773.70] At whatever time it is
[1773.70 → 1774.90] We'll try and figure something out
[1774.90 → 1776.44] Right now though it's looking like Monday
[1776.44 → 1777.60] Robert says
[1777.60 → 1779.54] First time watching a live stream live
[1779.54 → 1781.08] Because of the nut job on the loose
[1781.08 → 1782.34] Yeah well no I heard that he's
[1782.34 → 1783.34] I thought he's in custody
[1783.34 → 1783.62] Yeah
[1783.62 → 1785.80] Last I heard he was on a boat
[1785.80 → 1786.68] And they were chasing him
[1786.68 → 1788.26] So there's no way he got that far
[1788.26 → 1790.22] Yeah I saw a headline that said
[1790.22 → 1791.72] One dead one in custody
[1791.72 → 1793.64] But I could be wrong
[1793.64 → 1795.72] I mean I think there's been a lot of conflicting reports
[1795.72 → 1797.62] So hopefully you guys won't
[1797.62 → 1799.36] You guys won't sort of
[1799.36 → 1801.06] Twitch chat says they got him
[1801.06 → 1802.12] Yeah okay there you go
[1802.12 → 1803.36] So apparently they got him
[1803.36 → 1804.00] And good
[1804.00 → 1805.96] Oh he was hiding in the boat
[1805.96 → 1807.10] Oh okay
[1807.10 → 1808.22] So they weren't chasing his boat
[1808.22 → 1809.22] They just found his boat
[1809.22 → 1810.10] Yeah that's good
[1810.10 → 1811.46] Be in a boat but don't move the boat
[1811.46 → 1812.64] Very smart
[1812.64 → 1813.54] I mean that's
[1813.54 → 1814.60] These are the kinds of people
[1814.60 → 1815.84] Who blow up innocent people
[1815.84 → 1817.42] Because they're obviously brilliant
[1817.42 → 1822.04] I'm glad they caught them at any rate
[1822.04 → 1822.88] You know go internet
[1822.88 → 1823.74] And all the
[1823.74 → 1825.46] You know data analysis that went on
[1825.46 → 1826.88] I don't know if it ever led to anything
[1826.88 → 1828.70] But Reddit had a huge thing going on
[1828.70 → 1829.46] Pretty massive
[1829.46 → 1830.08] They had more
[1830.08 → 1831.24] They had like a few
[1831.24 → 1832.88] It was kind of cool
[1832.88 → 1835.02] Chris Gotham asks
[1835.02 → 1836.32] Should I build a gaming rig now
[1836.32 → 1837.36] Or wait till E3
[1837.36 → 1839.50] Well there won't be anything new at E3
[1839.50 → 1840.18] So
[1840.18 → 1843.26] Make of that what you will
[1843.26 → 1843.70] Mind you
[1843.70 → 1846.06] Haswell's going to be launching around that time
[1846.06 → 1847.64] Is that what he means for
[1847.64 → 1848.30] Oh
[1848.30 → 1849.90] Maybe he doesn't mean for announcements
[1849.90 → 1851.30] Maybe he means new games
[1851.30 → 1853.42] Maybe he means new games
[1853.42 → 1855.10] I mean there are lots of new games now
[1855.10 → 1856.70] Lots of games to play right now
[1856.70 → 1857.12] So
[1857.12 → 1858.22] If you're waiting for new games
[1858.22 → 1858.92] Wait till November
[1858.92 → 1860.74] Yeah but don't wait till November
[1860.74 → 1861.64] I don't remember to buy a PC
[1861.64 → 1862.38] But don't wait till November
[1862.38 → 1863.04] It's like five months
[1863.04 → 1864.12] Honestly I would just
[1864.12 → 1865.52] There won't be new graphics cards
[1865.52 → 1866.90] Between now and the end of the year
[1866.90 → 1867.50] In all likelihood
[1867.50 → 1868.82] Unless it's late in Q4
[1868.82 → 1870.08] If you've got something good
[1870.08 → 1871.62] I would wait till Haswell
[1871.62 → 1873.18] If you're dying
[1873.18 → 1874.52] I would just get something now
[1874.52 → 1875.16] Just get something now
[1875.16 → 1876.24] From what we've seen
[1876.24 → 1877.64] Haswell's not going to be
[1877.64 → 1879.10] Some kind of
[1879.10 → 1880.16] You know
[1880.16 → 1882.30] Conroe thing
[1882.30 → 1883.04] Where it's like
[1883.04 → 1883.84] We go from like
[1883.84 → 1885.44] Dark Ages computing power
[1885.44 → 1886.84] To way more
[1886.84 → 1887.28] I mean if you
[1887.28 → 1888.22] I mean honestly
[1888.22 → 1888.80] It's one of those things
[1888.80 → 1889.38] Where you can kind of
[1889.38 → 1890.10] Look at it logically
[1890.10 → 1890.78] And go okay
[1890.78 → 1892.58] You look at Intel's
[1892.58 → 1894.00] Die diagram of it
[1894.00 → 1894.46] And go
[1894.46 → 1895.80] Alright well the actual
[1895.80 → 1896.92] CPU die area
[1896.92 → 1897.78] Didn't increase
[1897.78 → 1898.92] But it's got like
[1898.92 → 1899.68] A huge like
[1899.68 → 1900.64] Graphics core now
[1900.64 → 1901.44] So if you're planning
[1901.44 → 1902.86] To use the onboard graphics
[1902.86 → 1903.54] On Haswell
[1903.54 → 1905.72] Then wait for Haswell
[1905.72 → 1907.18] If you're not
[1907.18 → 1907.50] Than
[1907.50 → 1910.52] It'll still be a little bit better
[1910.52 → 1911.56] But it's probably not worth the wait
[1911.56 → 1912.08] It's better than playing
[1912.08 → 1912.64] On a console
[1912.64 → 1913.58] Yeah
[1913.58 → 1915.22] Speaking of consoles
[1915.22 → 1916.40] Except for Super Nintendo
[1916.40 → 1918.16] Yeah except for Super Nintendo
[1918.16 → 1919.18] Which we still have to do
[1919.18 → 1921.40] That is my ultimate segue
[1921.40 → 1922.04] Of the night
[1922.04 → 1923.60] Into the next gen Xbox
[1923.60 → 1925.48] I don't know much about it
[1925.48 → 1927.10] But I know you need some add on
[1927.10 → 1927.86] For
[1927.86 → 1930.76] Retroactively playing games
[1930.76 → 1931.40] So there's a
[1931.40 → 1931.58] Oh
[1931.58 → 1931.88] Oh
[1931.88 → 1932.74] Fire it up there
[1932.74 → 1934.10] And we're going to do our new thing
[1934.10 → 1935.16] Oh
[1935.16 → 1936.14] I'll fire it up there
[1936.14 → 1937.48] I was like
[1937.48 → 1938.66] How am I supposed to do this
[1938.66 → 1939.70] Speaking of fired
[1939.70 → 1940.34] You're fired
[1940.34 → 1941.08] For what?
[1941.18 → 1941.50] For not
[1941.50 → 1942.42] For firing it up
[1942.42 → 1943.00] I don't know
[1943.00 → 1944.38] I had no ability to do that
[1944.38 → 1945.78] I'm on a segue roll
[1945.78 → 1947.80] Getting a segue roll
[1947.80 → 1948.42] Yeah
[1948.42 → 1951.32] That was a really high pitch
[1951.32 → 1952.06] One
[1952.06 → 1952.60] Okay
[1952.60 → 1953.74] That segue was fine
[1953.74 → 1954.74] Swaying to fire me
[1954.74 → 1956.12] You have no grounds to fire me for that
[1956.12 → 1957.42] Segway roll though
[1957.42 → 1957.82] Come on
[1957.82 → 1958.90] That was awesome
[1958.90 → 1959.64] That was terrible
[1959.64 → 1960.60] That was awesome
[1960.60 → 1960.88] Oh
[1960.88 → 1961.76] This is the wrong one
[1961.76 → 1962.70] That's not the one I want
[1962.70 → 1963.72] I want the
[1963.72 → 1964.72] Oh
[1964.72 → 1964.92] Yes
[1964.92 → 1966.58] I want the VR Zone rumour
[1966.58 → 1967.00] Okay
[1967.00 → 1967.66] So
[1967.66 → 1968.46] Hey
[1968.46 → 1969.00] Go
[1969.00 → 1969.26] Go
[1969.26 → 1969.46] Go
[1969.46 → 1969.74] Okay
[1969.74 → 1970.10] So
[1970.10 → 1971.66] VR Zone is claiming
[1971.66 → 1973.36] That the new Xbox 720
[1973.36 → 1975.40] Will be requiring you
[1975.40 → 1977.40] To buy a mini add-on
[1977.40 → 1978.54] To play older games
[1978.54 → 1980.60] Now with the original Xbox 360
[1980.60 → 1982.08] They gave you backwards compatibility
[1982.08 → 1983.18] With Xbox games
[1983.18 → 1984.34] But my understanding is
[1984.34 → 1984.90] A lot of the time
[1984.90 → 1986.02] It just didn't freaking work
[1986.02 → 1986.96] So
[1986.96 → 1987.92] There's that
[1987.92 → 1989.58] Most of the really
[1989.58 → 1990.78] Triple A mainstream titles
[1990.78 → 1991.52] Did work
[1991.52 → 1992.22] But with a couple
[1992.22 → 1993.78] Notable exceptions
[1993.78 → 1994.78] Honestly
[1994.78 → 1997.32] I'm going to play devil's advocate here
[1997.32 → 1998.22] And I'm going to say
[1998.22 → 1999.18] I like this approach
[1999.18 → 2002.62] What do you think?
[2003.06 → 2003.92] I don't know
[2003.92 → 2005.42] I don't really care
[2005.42 → 2006.20] Dedicate
[2006.20 → 2006.44] Okay
[2006.44 → 2006.72] Okay
[2006.72 → 2007.98] Imagine that you cared
[2007.98 → 2009.56] Imagine that you actually
[2009.56 → 2010.18] Were going to spend
[2010.18 → 2011.38] Oh it's 150 bucks?
[2011.52 → 2012.52] Yeah it's 150 bucks
[2012.52 → 2014.00] 150 bucks
[2014.00 → 2014.82] So it's basically
[2014.82 → 2015.52] A lot of money
[2015.52 → 2017.54] That's kind of brutal
[2017.54 → 2018.44] Okay
[2018.44 → 2019.76] It should be able to play
[2019.76 → 2020.46] Backwards compatible
[2020.46 → 2021.18] Like it
[2021.18 → 2022.40] That shouldn't be a big deal
[2022.40 → 2023.38] What do you mean by should though?
[2023.44 → 2025.42] This is an x86 architecture
[2025.42 → 2028.00] It's completely different
[2028.00 → 2029.50] From the Xbox 360
[2029.50 → 2029.90] Okay
[2029.90 → 2031.14] That actually does kind of make sense
[2031.14 → 2031.56] It's not like
[2031.56 → 2033.02] Oh I'm upgrading from Windows Vista
[2033.02 → 2033.66] To Windows 7
[2033.66 → 2034.42] So basically
[2034.42 → 2035.68] It would increase
[2035.68 → 2037.20] The bomb cost by so much
[2037.20 → 2037.62] Yes
[2037.62 → 2038.36] That it would be nice
[2038.36 → 2039.94] To have it cheaper for everyone
[2039.94 → 2041.00] And then if you do
[2041.00 → 2041.76] Actually want to play
[2041.76 → 2042.58] Backwards compatible stuff
[2042.58 → 2043.66] You can add that to it
[2043.66 → 2044.62] If you do actually
[2044.62 → 2045.68] Want to play old games
[2045.68 → 2047.08] And you don't actually
[2047.08 → 2049.32] Already have an Xbox 360
[2049.32 → 2050.38] Which is kind of funky
[2050.38 → 2051.18] If you want to play old games
[2051.18 → 2051.90] You probably already got
[2051.90 → 2052.56] An Xbox 360
[2052.56 → 2053.04] I mean yes
[2053.04 → 2054.80] I understand the convenience factor
[2054.80 → 2056.24] Of not wanting to
[2056.24 → 2058.08] Press a button on your receiver
[2058.08 → 2059.62] To switch the HDMI input
[2059.62 → 2061.22] But from my perspective
[2061.22 → 2062.22] And you don't get trade in value
[2062.22 → 2063.30] From trading in your old Xbox
[2063.30 → 2064.98] That's true
[2064.98 → 2066.12] That's true
[2066.12 → 2066.98] You don't get trade in value
[2066.98 → 2067.56] Mind you
[2067.56 → 2068.78] It's cheap enough
[2068.78 → 2070.02] At 150 bucks
[2070.02 → 2071.50] To me, it looks like
[2071.50 → 2072.14] They're not taking
[2072.14 → 2072.80] A bunch of margin
[2072.80 → 2073.74] I suspect
[2073.74 → 2075.16] What's actually inside it
[2075.16 → 2076.06] If this rumour turns out
[2076.06 → 2076.56] To be true
[2076.56 → 2078.52] Is basically just an Xbox 360
[2078.52 → 2081.08] Because it couldn't cost
[2081.08 → 2083.20] Much more than 150 bucks
[2083.20 → 2083.98] To basically build
[2083.98 → 2085.14] An Xbox 360 now
[2085.14 → 2085.68] One thing
[2085.68 → 2086.64] Don't scream anymore
[2086.64 → 2087.30] I don't think
[2087.30 → 2088.16] Attenuation's working
[2088.16 → 2089.02] Oh
[2089.02 → 2089.74] Everyone was like
[2089.74 → 2090.66] Oh god my ears
[2090.66 → 2091.70] Oh sorry about that
[2091.70 → 2092.52] Um
[2092.52 → 2094.58] So I don't think
[2094.58 → 2096.18] Where was I
[2096.18 → 2098.02] Xbox 360
[2098.02 → 2098.76] Something
[2098.76 → 2099.36] Something
[2099.36 → 2099.94] Something
[2099.94 → 2100.30] One thing
[2100.30 → 2101.70] How much resale value
[2101.70 → 2102.42] Do you think you could get
[2102.42 → 2104.16] For trading in an Xbox 360
[2104.16 → 2105.44] I have no idea
[2105.44 → 2106.40] Because if you could get
[2106.40 → 2106.92] Like a hundred
[2106.92 → 2107.68] It's probably at least a hundred bucks
[2107.68 → 2108.72] If it's a hundred bucks
[2108.72 → 2109.50] Just trade it in
[2109.50 → 2110.22] And buy the thing
[2110.22 → 2110.54] Right
[2110.54 → 2111.86] So it's one of those things
[2111.86 → 2112.42] Where I look at it
[2112.42 → 2112.54] And I go
[2112.54 → 2112.86] You know what
[2112.86 → 2113.80] It's not a bad solution
[2113.80 → 2114.62] Because if you're giving
[2114.62 → 2115.60] So what it'll do
[2115.60 → 2116.48] Is it'll make it
[2116.48 → 2117.24] So you don't have to
[2117.24 → 2117.86] Okay I've rumoured
[2117.86 → 2118.30] Allegedly
[2118.30 → 2119.38] It'll make it so that
[2119.38 → 2120.12] You don't have to have
[2120.12 → 2121.80] Two separate HDMI connections out
[2121.80 → 2123.12] So it's kind of like a pass through
[2123.12 → 2124.14] Which will lead us
[2124.14 → 2124.86] To our next thing
[2124.86 → 2125.52] Um
[2125.52 → 2126.32] So you can play
[2126.32 → 2127.18] Your older games
[2127.18 → 2129.30] And you can not have
[2129.30 → 2129.80] Two boxes
[2129.80 → 2131.32] And you can unload
[2131.32 → 2132.36] Your old Xbox 360
[2132.36 → 2133.26] And because
[2133.26 → 2134.18] What I suspect
[2134.18 → 2134.68] They're doing
[2134.68 → 2135.30] Is they're basically
[2135.30 → 2136.04] Just putting a small
[2136.04 → 2137.26] Xbox 360 in it
[2137.26 → 2138.32] The compatibility
[2138.32 → 2139.24] Should be better
[2139.24 → 2140.58] Than a kludge solution
[2140.58 → 2141.30] Like what Sony
[2141.30 → 2142.40] Implemented with the PS3
[2142.40 → 2142.82] Originally
[2142.82 → 2143.64] Right
[2143.64 → 2144.34] Is this
[2144.34 → 2145.28] Um
[2145.28 → 2146.02] Okay
[2146.02 → 2147.38] I might not be right
[2147.38 → 2147.78] About this
[2147.78 → 2149.10] Xbox 720
[2149.10 → 2149.90] Always on
[2149.90 → 2150.12] Right
[2150.12 → 2151.68] That's
[2151.68 → 2152.44] Rumoured to be
[2152.44 → 2153.34] Not necessarily true
[2153.34 → 2154.22] It's actually in this
[2154.22 → 2155.20] Same article
[2155.20 → 2155.50] Okay
[2155.50 → 2156.56] On VR Zone
[2156.56 → 2156.88] But I mean
[2156.88 → 2158.04] Everything's very much
[2158.04 → 2159.18] Up in the air right now
[2159.18 → 2160.88] So the latest rumour
[2160.88 → 2161.94] Will require a separate
[2161.94 → 2162.74] Add-on
[2162.74 → 2164.48] May cost a few gold coins
[2164.48 → 2165.58] Uh
[2165.58 → 2166.22] However
[2166.22 → 2167.44] Something something something
[2167.44 → 2167.74] Yeah
[2167.74 → 2168.30] Uh
[2168.30 → 2169.76] The rumour is that
[2169.76 → 2171.04] It will not require
[2171.04 → 2172.12] An always on internet connection
[2172.12 → 2172.92] To play games locally
[2172.92 → 2174.08] But we'll see
[2174.08 → 2175.10] Uh
[2175.10 → 2176.00] And more importantly
[2176.00 → 2177.22] Microsoft probably
[2177.22 → 2177.96] Won't be blocking
[2177.96 → 2179.36] The playing of used games
[2179.36 → 2180.12] On the new console
[2180.12 → 2181.26] Which we will see about
[2181.26 → 2181.84] I have no idea
[2181.84 → 2182.92] How true any of that is
[2182.92 → 2184.66] If that's not true
[2184.66 → 2186.68] If it is always on
[2186.68 → 2187.80] So we're taking some
[2187.80 → 2189.62] Kind of leaps and bounds here
[2189.62 → 2191.02] Which might not ever happen
[2191.02 → 2191.78] Um
[2191.78 → 2192.90] If the add-on thing
[2192.90 → 2194.54] Inherited the always on
[2194.54 → 2195.06] Yes
[2195.06 → 2195.96] Then that would be terrible
[2195.96 → 2196.92] That would be brutal
[2196.92 → 2198.54] I'd want my old Xbox 360 back
[2198.54 → 2198.88] Exactly
[2198.88 → 2200.68] But this is very possibly
[2200.68 → 2203.20] Not even worth talking about
[2203.20 → 2203.98] So whatever
[2203.98 → 2205.62] So speaking of pass-through
[2205.62 → 2206.54] Um
[2206.54 → 2208.20] The Verge had an interesting article
[2208.20 → 2209.00] About
[2209.00 → 2210.62] Microsoft's plans
[2210.62 → 2212.08] For the next generation Xbox
[2212.08 → 2214.00] Taking over your TV
[2214.00 → 2215.26] Is sort of their uh
[2215.26 → 2216.16] Their
[2216.16 → 2217.56] The sensational
[2217.56 → 2219.38] Half of their
[2219.38 → 2219.84] Otherwise
[2219.84 → 2221.46] Not that sensational headline
[2221.46 → 2223.76] Because interact with your cable box
[2223.76 → 2225.26] Is probably more like what
[2225.26 → 2226.46] It actually sounds like
[2226.46 → 2227.18] They're planning to do
[2227.18 → 2227.44] So
[2227.44 → 2229.00] Similarly to Google TV
[2229.00 → 2230.02] Your cable box
[2230.02 → 2231.02] Would go
[2231.02 → 2231.96] Um
[2231.96 → 2233.56] HDMI out
[2233.56 → 2234.82] Into your Xbox
[2234.82 → 2236.64] Which would then pass through
[2236.64 → 2237.60] To your TV
[2237.60 → 2239.20] Now it's going to depend on Microsoft
[2239.20 → 2240.16] Having relationships
[2240.16 → 2241.34] With the content providers
[2241.34 → 2243.06] To even be allowed
[2243.06 → 2244.00] To circumvent whatever
[2244.00 → 2244.68] HDCP
[2244.68 → 2246.16] Whatever else is going on
[2246.16 → 2247.22] With the HDMI signal
[2247.22 → 2248.46] But uh
[2248.46 → 2250.76] The plan is to inject a layer on top
[2250.76 → 2252.32] That would be something like
[2252.32 → 2253.22] It could be marketplace
[2253.22 → 2254.22] It could be
[2254.22 → 2254.66] Uh
[2254.66 → 2255.48] More advanced
[2255.48 → 2256.78] Guide and listings
[2256.78 → 2257.80] For TV shows
[2257.80 → 2259.44] It could be additional content
[2259.44 → 2259.94] Netflix
[2259.94 → 2260.82] Whatever else
[2260.82 → 2262.36] It'll inject on top
[2262.36 → 2263.70] Of what you're already getting
[2263.70 → 2264.60] With your set-top box
[2264.60 → 2264.88] I mean
[2264.88 → 2265.58] Um
[2265.58 → 2266.86] I suspect a lot of it
[2266.86 → 2268.04] Will only work in the US
[2268.04 → 2268.70] Um
[2268.70 → 2270.00] Particularly at launch
[2270.00 → 2270.24] But
[2270.24 → 2270.48] Yeah
[2270.48 → 2271.58] I mean
[2271.58 → 2272.74] Could something like this
[2272.74 → 2274.66] Make the Xbox part of your living room
[2274.66 → 2275.34] Even though
[2275.34 → 2276.78] You have no use for a console
[2276.78 → 2277.84] From a game's perspective
[2277.84 → 2280.30] I
[2280.30 → 2281.50] I don't watch TV
[2281.50 → 2282.76] Oh
[2282.76 → 2283.66] Yeah
[2283.66 → 2285.14] What do you do?
[2285.26 → 2285.94] I play video games
[2285.94 → 2286.56] And I program
[2286.56 → 2286.94] And I
[2286.94 → 2288.98] Don't have any time
[2288.98 → 2290.12] Because I work so much
[2290.12 → 2290.64] Right
[2290.64 → 2291.30] Okay
[2291.30 → 2291.72] Fair enough
[2291.72 → 2292.32] Um
[2292.32 → 2294.12] The other thing that Microsoft's looking at
[2294.12 → 2295.56] Is how to make to connect
[2295.56 → 2296.82] Make the living room experience
[2296.82 → 2297.50] More engaging
[2297.50 → 2298.34] So things like
[2298.34 → 2299.72] Being able to track multiple people
[2299.72 → 2300.32] At a time
[2300.32 → 2300.90] Uh
[2300.90 → 2301.98] Being able to track
[2301.98 → 2302.74] Eye movements
[2302.74 → 2304.42] So if one person looks away
[2304.42 → 2306.48] Movie paused
[2306.48 → 2308.34] Which is the kind of thing
[2308.34 → 2308.64] Where I
[2308.64 → 2310.56] Okay hold on
[2310.56 → 2311.22] Hold on
[2311.22 → 2312.30] Could be like settings though
[2312.30 → 2313.60] Who knows how advanced
[2313.60 → 2315.06] The next generation connect is
[2315.06 → 2317.06] So maybe the next gen connect
[2317.06 → 2317.74] Is so advanced
[2317.74 → 2318.36] That I can go
[2318.36 → 2320.20] Only pause it if I walk away
[2320.20 → 2320.98] Yeah
[2320.98 → 2321.58] Well
[2321.58 → 2322.80] That would seriously be a thing
[2322.80 → 2323.56] Because like your sister
[2323.56 → 2324.56] Is sitting on the couch
[2324.56 → 2325.32] And goes
[2325.32 → 2326.08] Uh
[2326.08 → 2327.10] Looks at her phone
[2327.10 → 2328.22] And my movie's like
[2328.22 → 2328.74] Well
[2328.74 → 2331.00] I don't want my movie to pause
[2331.00 → 2332.70] And my immersion to be destroyed
[2332.70 → 2334.08] And my
[2334.08 → 2335.00] I thought you don't watch movies
[2335.00 → 2336.18] I watch
[2336.18 → 2337.26] I said I don't watch TV
[2337.26 → 2339.42] I watch movies
[2339.42 → 2341.50] You're such
[2341.50 → 2344.18] So much trolling
[2344.18 → 2346.80] So the immersion level being reduced
[2346.80 → 2347.18] Um
[2347.18 → 2348.74] Everything
[2348.74 → 2349.90] It just destroys the whole experience
[2349.90 → 2351.80] Pausing a movie sucks
[2351.80 → 2352.94] Yeah
[2352.94 → 2354.50] Everything about pausing a movie sucks
[2354.50 → 2355.92] Well except when you're the one
[2355.92 → 2356.64] Who has to pee
[2356.64 → 2358.80] Then you should have gone beforehand
[2358.80 → 2359.64] Sometimes
[2359.64 → 2361.02] You drink a lot of beverages
[2361.02 → 2361.64] During the movie
[2361.64 → 2362.24] Phew
[2362.24 → 2364.70] Water today over a span
[2364.70 → 2366.42] Of about an hour and a half
[2366.42 → 2367.64] And then in between
[2367.64 → 2368.94] Like every shot
[2368.94 → 2369.44] Well okay
[2369.44 → 2369.98] You're just like
[2369.98 → 2370.96] Oh I have to go to the washer
[2370.96 → 2372.00] You're exaggerating
[2372.00 → 2373.08] Not by a lot
[2373.08 → 2374.78] There were two shots
[2374.78 → 2375.44] In between there
[2375.44 → 2375.78] Alright
[2375.78 → 2376.70] What's our next topic
[2376.70 → 2378.66] I guess if you
[2378.66 → 2379.86] If you add the take
[2379.86 → 2380.56] Yeah shots
[2380.56 → 2381.78] Because we don't
[2381.78 → 2382.34] Count takes
[2382.34 → 2383.12] You only count shots
[2383.12 → 2384.48] Okay well
[2384.48 → 2386.38] Moving on to some more
[2386.38 → 2387.18] Twitter Q&A
[2387.18 → 2388.80] No there will not be a live stream
[2388.80 → 2389.80] On this coming Monday
[2389.80 → 2390.66] Great question
[2390.66 → 2393.12] And it's too close to this one
[2393.12 → 2394.28] I don't think it makes sense
[2394.28 → 2395.54] It'll have been like three days
[2395.54 → 2396.48] And it'll have been a weekend
[2396.48 → 2398.24] What do we possibly expect
[2398.24 → 2398.84] To have happened
[2398.84 → 2400.04] Um
[2400.04 → 2400.96] Why will it not be on
[2400.96 → 2401.84] Saturday or Sunday
[2401.84 → 2402.38] Whoa whoa
[2402.38 → 2403.32] What what
[2403.32 → 2403.78] What what what
[2403.78 → 2404.52] Stream's down
[2404.52 → 2406.06] Why is the stream down
[2406.06 → 2408.70] I am so sick of
[2408.70 → 2409.98] Windows Live Movie Maker
[2409.98 → 2411.22] Like cutting this thing together
[2411.22 → 2412.12] It takes so long
[2412.12 → 2414.56] What the actual hell
[2414.56 → 2415.36] Is going on here
[2415.36 → 2416.82] It's back up
[2416.82 → 2417.44] Hello
[2417.44 → 2418.94] Apparently we're back
[2418.94 → 2420.76] Hello
[2420.76 → 2422.52] So hold on
[2422.52 → 2423.12] Let me just check
[2423.12 → 2424.18] The XSplit recordings
[2424.18 → 2425.10] Let's see if it
[2425.10 → 2427.02] If it split it apart
[2427.02 → 2429.24] 233 legs
[2429.24 → 2430.32] Apparently it didn't
[2430.32 → 2430.86] Split apart
[2430.86 → 2432.02] So there you go
[2432.02 → 2433.10] I have no idea
[2433.10 → 2434.06] What happened there
[2434.06 → 2435.12] That's someone telling you
[2435.12 → 2435.78] That stream's dead
[2435.78 → 2437.22] Yeah I'm sure it is
[2437.22 → 2439.02] Someone else that I'm
[2439.02 → 2439.74] Going to be blocking
[2439.74 → 2440.66] On my phone after
[2440.66 → 2442.08] Android's awesome
[2442.08 → 2443.92] It has a block feature
[2443.92 → 2445.88] So all I had to do
[2445.88 → 2447.20] To uh to get rid
[2447.20 → 2447.98] Of the people
[2447.98 → 2448.72] Who were calling
[2448.72 → 2449.70] Or texting my phone
[2449.70 → 2450.72] Was just click block
[2450.72 → 2451.94] And then I actually
[2451.94 → 2452.96] Don't hear from them anymore
[2452.96 → 2453.92] So we were worried
[2453.92 → 2454.44] That we'd have to
[2454.44 → 2454.94] Change his number
[2454.94 → 2455.68] Because he got
[2455.68 → 2456.30] Yeah
[2456.30 → 2457.74] Trolled so hard
[2457.74 → 2457.86] But I don't
[2457.86 → 2458.86] I actually
[2458.86 → 2459.94] It was just a few people
[2459.94 → 2461.04] That were obnoxious
[2461.04 → 2462.06] And they're all blocked
[2462.06 → 2462.86] And, so I think
[2462.86 → 2463.86] Who knows
[2463.86 → 2464.46] They might still be
[2464.46 → 2465.00] Trying to call
[2465.00 → 2466.78] But I don't even know
[2466.78 → 2468.06] So yeah
[2468.06 → 2469.06] There you go
[2469.06 → 2470.70] Um question here
[2470.70 → 2471.76] Why will it not be
[2471.76 → 2472.62] On Saturday Sunday
[2472.62 → 2474.92] Because we do have lives
[2474.92 → 2477.02] And he has a baby guy
[2477.02 → 2478.26] Like
[2478.26 → 2480.60] Like sacrificing my time
[2480.60 → 2481.52] Is one thing
[2481.52 → 2482.74] You're not actually
[2482.74 → 2483.34] At this point
[2483.34 → 2484.22] I don't even care
[2484.22 → 2485.34] About sacrificing his time
[2485.34 → 2486.06] I don't care about
[2486.06 → 2487.06] His time at all
[2487.06 → 2487.94] You're sacrificing
[2487.94 → 2489.64] His baby's time man
[2489.64 → 2490.52] So yeah
[2490.52 → 2491.66] I'm not a fan of babies
[2491.66 → 2492.94] Some people might know that
[2492.94 → 2494.16] But as a dad
[2494.16 → 2495.38] You still need to spend time
[2495.38 → 2496.02] With your baby
[2496.02 → 2496.62] So
[2496.62 → 2497.50] That's just how it works
[2497.50 → 2498.62] I actually work
[2498.62 → 2499.40] Monday to Friday
[2499.40 → 2500.92] And I actually work
[2500.92 → 2501.46] A lot more than
[2501.46 → 2502.34] 40 hours a week
[2502.34 → 2503.80] Outside the live stream
[2503.80 → 2505.30] So I'm actually
[2505.30 → 2506.54] Not going to be doing it
[2506.54 → 2507.56] On a Saturday or Sunday
[2507.56 → 2508.62] So I mean
[2508.62 → 2509.62] Thank you for the suggestion
[2509.62 → 2510.76] But that is actually
[2510.76 → 2511.50] Not going to happen
[2511.50 → 2512.72] Uh when do we get
[2512.72 → 2513.48] To see the new offices
[2513.48 → 2514.30] We're not going to be
[2514.30 → 2515.32] Moving for a couple of months
[2515.32 → 2516.70] I think it's like
[2516.70 → 2517.52] 3 to 4 a.m.
[2517.52 → 2518.38] In Southeast Asia
[2518.38 → 2519.24] Sorry
[2519.24 → 2520.50] Um
[2520.50 → 2522.70] One thing that we can do
[2522.70 → 2523.78] I haven't pitched this
[2523.78 → 2524.42] To Linus at all
[2524.42 → 2525.52] So this could be interesting
[2525.52 → 2526.78] Is we can grab
[2526.78 → 2527.98] All the time slots
[2527.98 → 2529.24] That are a chance
[2529.24 → 2530.60] Throw them in a poll
[2530.60 → 2531.10] On the forum
[2531.10 → 2531.92] Sure
[2531.92 → 2533.16] This won't happen now
[2533.16 → 2534.48] Oh god
[2534.48 → 2535.24] Of course you're getting
[2535.24 → 2535.68] Spammed now
[2535.68 → 2535.94] It's okay
[2535.94 → 2536.66] I'll just shut them
[2536.66 → 2537.22] All off after
[2537.22 → 2538.08] And then block them
[2538.08 → 2538.40] Yeah
[2538.40 → 2538.82] And then I'll just
[2538.82 → 2538.98] Block them
[2538.98 → 2539.32] Um
[2539.32 → 2539.86] It's not going to
[2539.86 → 2540.42] Happen now
[2540.42 → 2541.04] I'm not going to
[2541.04 → 2541.42] Do it now
[2541.42 → 2542.10] So don't Zero rush
[2542.10 → 2542.70] To the forum now
[2542.70 → 2543.36] Don't bring it down
[2543.36 → 2543.70] Yet
[2543.70 → 2544.44] We'll save that
[2544.44 → 2545.12] For build logs
[2545.12 → 2546.18] Um
[2546.18 → 2546.78] Yeah
[2546.78 → 2548.10] Uh
[2548.10 → 2549.36] But sometime this weekend
[2549.36 → 2550.34] Maybe after the stream
[2550.34 → 2550.84] Or something
[2550.84 → 2551.52] I'll jump on
[2551.52 → 2552.50] Or Linus will jump on
[2552.50 → 2553.64] We'll make a poll
[2553.64 → 2555.62] In the forum news section
[2555.62 → 2556.76] Or general
[2556.76 → 2557.70] Sure
[2557.70 → 2558.76] You'll see it
[2558.76 → 2559.42] Because I'm sure
[2559.42 → 2559.88] Tons of people
[2559.88 → 2560.44] Will post in it
[2560.44 → 2561.62] And we'll post
[2561.62 → 2563.58] All the time slots
[2563.58 → 2564.42] That are even possible
[2564.42 → 2565.08] For us to do
[2565.08 → 2566.76] And then let people vote
[2566.76 → 2567.32] Sure
[2567.32 → 2568.98] Um
[2568.98 → 2570.04] Someone asks about
[2570.04 → 2570.72] South America
[2570.72 → 2571.50] Aren't we important
[2571.50 → 2572.12] You guys are in the
[2572.12 → 2573.14] Same time zone as us
[2573.14 → 2577.14] What do you want
[2577.14 → 2579.34] And everyone's important
[2579.34 → 2579.84] We just
[2579.84 → 2580.28] Like
[2580.28 → 2581.08] Honestly
[2581.08 → 2582.82] Baby
[2582.82 → 2584.20] Like I said before
[2584.20 → 2585.52] Uh
[2585.52 → 2586.70] If you're going to use
[2586.70 → 2587.12] The S4
[2587.12 → 2587.82] How about the Android
[2587.82 → 2588.38] 30 day trial
[2588.38 → 2589.46] I'm going to finish out
[2589.46 → 2590.50] The HTC One
[2590.50 → 2591.28] 30 day trial
[2591.28 → 2592.70] The S4 demo unit
[2592.70 → 2593.04] I got
[2593.04 → 2594.06] Has its own sim in it
[2594.06 → 2594.86] So I can play around
[2594.86 → 2595.40] With it without
[2595.40 → 2596.24] Interfering with the
[2596.24 → 2596.86] 30 day trial
[2596.86 → 2597.94] Uh
[2597.94 → 2598.98] Some cars are coming out
[2598.98 → 2599.46] With integrated
[2599.46 → 2600.24] Wireless charging
[2600.24 → 2600.80] Put the phone on
[2600.80 → 2601.22] A certain place
[2601.22 → 2601.62] On the dash
[2601.62 → 2602.02] And it charges
[2602.02 → 2602.82] That's very cool
[2602.82 → 2603.52] That is really cool
[2603.52 → 2604.12] And that'll probably
[2604.12 → 2604.80] Be one of those
[2604.80 → 2605.86] Sticky pad slots too
[2605.86 → 2607.48] Very very very cool
[2607.48 → 2608.22] Maybe uh
[2608.22 → 2608.72] You know that thing
[2608.72 → 2609.48] Diesel keeps talking
[2609.48 → 2610.28] About every once in a while
[2610.28 → 2611.20] Where it can project
[2611.20 → 2612.12] Uh
[2612.12 → 2612.98] Uh
[2612.98 → 2614.14] Images onto your windshield
[2614.14 → 2615.06] That
[2615.06 → 2616.04] Yeah for like GPS
[2616.04 → 2617.18] Maybe they'll have
[2617.18 → 2617.98] The wireless charging
[2617.98 → 2618.84] And sticky pad
[2618.84 → 2619.68] Right where that is
[2619.68 → 2620.38] That would be sweet
[2620.38 → 2621.50] That would be so awesome
[2621.50 → 2622.16] That would like
[2622.16 → 2623.32] Actually be the sweetest
[2623.32 → 2623.72] Thing ever
[2623.72 → 2624.40] I don't know a lot
[2624.40 → 2624.78] About this
[2624.78 → 2625.34] If you want to know
[2625.34 → 2625.94] More about it
[2625.94 → 2627.34] Tweet Diesel the intern
[2627.34 → 2629.18] He'll talk to you about it
[2629.18 → 2629.50] Yeah
[2629.50 → 2630.60] He knows
[2630.60 → 2631.84] He knows all the things
[2631.84 → 2632.66] I'm pretty sure
[2632.66 → 2634.40] He follows every news show
[2634.40 → 2635.46] Ever
[2635.46 → 2635.88] I swear
[2635.88 → 2636.62] His room
[2636.62 → 2637.82] Must have more monitors
[2637.82 → 2638.24] Than mine
[2638.24 → 2639.10] And mine has a lot
[2639.10 → 2639.98] And they must just
[2639.98 → 2641.54] Like multiple Reddit pages
[2641.54 → 2642.98] Like every single news show
[2642.98 → 2644.46] That's actually casting
[2644.46 → 2645.02] Right now
[2645.02 → 2646.04] Every Reddit page
[2646.04 → 2646.48] Oh
[2646.48 → 2647.40] Oh
[2647.40 → 2648.66] Check this out
[2648.66 → 2649.12] I did it when you
[2649.12 → 2649.60] Weren't looking
[2649.60 → 2650.18] We have
[2650.18 → 2650.76] Okay
[2650.76 → 2651.66] So someone
[2651.66 → 2652.82] Someone helped me
[2652.82 → 2654.38] Capture Slick's duck face
[2654.38 → 2655.24] Oh
[2655.24 → 2656.30] I thought I was going to
[2656.30 → 2656.94] Get away with that
[2656.94 → 2658.32] Yeah you actually
[2658.32 → 2659.36] Actually didn't
[2659.36 → 2659.92] Hold on a second
[2659.92 → 2660.48] Hold on a second
[2660.48 → 2661.34] Is that even actually
[2661.34 → 2661.82] A duck face
[2661.82 → 2662.08] Hold on
[2662.08 → 2662.64] I got to share this
[2662.64 → 2663.84] With everyone
[2663.84 → 2664.40] Just a sec
[2664.40 → 2664.84] Just a sec
[2664.84 → 2665.24] Hold on
[2665.24 → 2670.04] I'm not even going to look
[2670.04 → 2671.18] Hi Twitch chat
[2671.18 → 2673.24] Add screen region
[2673.24 → 2674.32] Let's just add
[2674.32 → 2675.20] This whole screen
[2675.20 → 2675.62] So
[2675.62 → 2676.84] Also it's lagging
[2676.84 → 2677.48] So there's pretty much
[2677.48 → 2678.26] No point in you doing this
[2678.26 → 2679.18] Because it's lagging so much
[2679.18 → 2679.76] There we go
[2679.76 → 2681.18] So there you guys have it
[2681.18 → 2682.06] That is
[2682.06 → 2682.94] Slick's
[2682.94 → 2683.38] Epic
[2683.38 → 2684.52] Duck face
[2684.52 → 2684.74] Goes in
[2684.74 → 2685.36] Boom
[2685.36 → 2686.38] You just dropped it
[2686.38 → 2687.66] Just dropped what?
[2688.02 → 2688.74] The stream I think
[2688.74 → 2689.76] How could it possibly
[2689.76 → 2690.54] Go down from that?
[2690.56 → 2690.82] Oh no
[2690.82 → 2691.66] They're all just laughing
[2691.66 → 2692.04] At me now
[2692.04 → 2693.00] There we go
[2693.00 → 2694.34] But it's lagging like crazy
[2694.34 → 2694.60] Yeah
[2694.60 → 2695.64] Alright
[2695.64 → 2696.48] It's lagging a lot
[2696.48 → 2697.42] You look fantastic
[2697.42 → 2699.18] This is why we like you
[2699.18 → 2700.42] Because you're awesome
[2700.42 → 2702.60] Alright
[2702.60 → 2703.74] So let's go back
[2703.74 → 2704.40] For those of you
[2704.40 → 2705.60] Who weren't with us earlier
[2705.60 → 2707.24] I challenged Slick
[2707.24 → 2707.68] To
[2707.68 → 2708.80] To
[2708.80 → 2709.06] To
[2709.06 → 2709.34] To
[2709.34 → 2709.58] To
[2709.58 → 2710.84] Give us his best duck face
[2710.84 → 2711.16] So
[2711.16 → 2712.86] Stream will keep on lagging
[2712.86 → 2713.64] For 20 seconds
[2713.64 → 2715.22] Or even go offline
[2715.22 → 2716.02] For a minute or two
[2716.02 → 2717.26] In what situation?
[2717.48 → 2718.38] I don't know
[2718.38 → 2719.86] Seriously guys
[2719.86 → 2720.88] Get a camera slider
[2720.88 → 2721.38] Your advert
[2721.38 → 2722.32] We have a slider
[2722.32 → 2724.22] We have slider shots
[2724.22 → 2725.06] In the Seagate
[2725.06 → 2726.04] Wireless Plus video
[2726.04 → 2728.14] We have slider shots
[2728.14 → 2729.02] In the upcoming video
[2729.02 → 2730.30] We have a slider
[2730.30 → 2732.16] Hello from Toronto
[2732.16 → 2732.74] It's late here
[2732.74 → 2733.86] How high do motherboard
[2733.86 → 2734.68] Manufacturers
[2734.68 → 2736.20] Prioritize the IT segment
[2736.20 → 2736.74] Of the market?
[2736.96 → 2737.38] Quite high
[2737.38 → 2738.04] What?
[2738.68 → 2739.18] IT?
[2739.36 → 2739.64] Yeah
[2739.64 → 2740.60] Since when?
[2741.16 → 2741.78] There won't be anything
[2741.78 → 2742.30] At launch
[2742.30 → 2743.52] Yeah
[2743.52 → 2745.40] But they still support it
[2745.40 → 2745.68] Yeah
[2745.68 → 2746.24] They still support it
[2746.24 → 2746.56] Well I mean
[2746.56 → 2747.58] Asus has a high end
[2747.58 → 2748.30] IT board
[2748.30 → 2748.74] Yeah
[2748.74 → 2749.58] Which is like beast
[2749.58 → 2751.14] Gigabytes IT board
[2751.14 → 2752.20] Doesn't overclock
[2752.20 → 2754.14] Still it's IT
[2754.14 → 2755.54] Asus' one is boss
[2755.54 → 2756.70] Asus' one is like beast
[2756.70 → 2757.50] And there's a few other
[2757.50 → 2758.32] That are really nice
[2758.32 → 2758.60] Yeah
[2758.60 → 2759.86] For a weird subcategory
[2759.86 → 2760.26] Like that
[2760.26 → 2761.10] That's pretty supportive
[2761.10 → 2763.94] This is driving me crazy
[2763.94 → 2764.74] What is it?
[2766.08 → 2766.48] There
[2766.48 → 2767.16] Oh
[2767.16 → 2768.32] What if I sit up?
[2768.66 → 2768.94] No, no
[2768.94 → 2769.40] It doesn't matter
[2769.40 → 2769.94] It's all good
[2769.94 → 2771.36] It's just that it was
[2771.36 → 2771.84] Well
[2771.84 → 2772.78] Now my head's cut off
[2772.78 → 2773.92] Well that's okay
[2773.92 → 2775.62] Because Diesel explained to me
[2775.62 → 2776.74] That it's okay to cut off
[2776.74 → 2777.44] Someone's head
[2777.44 → 2778.36] As long as you don't
[2778.36 → 2779.10] Cut off their chin
[2779.10 → 2780.10] Oh
[2780.10 → 2780.80] Yeah
[2780.80 → 2782.30] Zombies or something
[2782.30 → 2783.00] I'm going to go back to
[2783.00 → 2783.66] Leaning
[2783.66 → 2785.28] Because I like that more anyway
[2785.28 → 2787.54] Okay what were we talking about?
[2787.68 → 2788.02] Well yeah
[2788.02 → 2789.12] We were doing Twitter Q&A
[2789.12 → 2791.06] Hey you guys like the G7 10 Plus
[2791.06 → 2791.44] Yes
[2791.44 → 2792.64] It's nice
[2792.64 → 2793.80] And one thing that pretty much
[2793.80 → 2794.28] No one knows
[2794.28 → 2795.46] Is it comes with black O-rings
[2795.46 → 2796.22] Under the keycaps
[2796.22 → 2796.98] Yeah very cool
[2796.98 → 2798.26] Which is like an after market
[2798.26 → 2799.00] Mod type thing
[2799.00 → 2800.06] They're not going to be able to see that
[2800.06 → 2801.20] Oh
[2801.20 → 2802.48] Little O-rings
[2802.48 → 2803.40] Under every keycap
[2803.40 → 2804.14] That make it quieter
[2804.14 → 2804.60] By the way
[2804.60 → 2805.80] Don't just pull your keycaps off
[2805.80 → 2806.80] Do it with a proper key pull
[2806.80 → 2807.00] Yeah
[2807.00 → 2807.30] Yeah
[2807.30 → 2808.70] What are you doing man?
[2808.84 → 2808.98] What?
[2809.24 → 2809.56] What did I?
[2809.72 → 2809.88] What?
[2809.88 → 2811.90] I just wanted to give a shout-out
[2811.90 → 2812.48] To your forums
[2812.48 → 2813.36] They helped me pick upgrades
[2813.36 → 2814.36] To improve my stream
[2814.36 → 2815.02] Great community
[2815.02 → 2815.86] Awesome
[2815.86 → 2816.52] Thanks Miles
[2816.52 → 2817.88] And hopefully you continue
[2817.88 → 2818.56] To go there
[2818.56 → 2819.60] While we transition
[2819.60 → 2820.38] To better forums
[2820.38 → 2821.40] Because currently they suck
[2821.40 → 2821.72] Yeah
[2821.72 → 2823.96] That's not
[2823.96 → 2824.48] Nope
[2824.48 → 2824.98] Nope
[2824.98 → 2825.72] It's okay
[2825.72 → 2826.74] I hope it's coming soon
[2826.74 → 2827.48] Let me just put it that way
[2827.48 → 2829.10] It's hopefully coming soon
[2829.10 → 2830.90] PS4 is only going to be able
[2830.90 → 2832.02] To play PS3 stuff
[2832.02 → 2833.58] Only through the cloud
[2833.58 → 2835.22] Not on the console itself
[2835.22 → 2836.70] So if you have
[2836.70 → 2838.26] Not very good internet
[2838.26 → 2839.28] Which is I'm sure
[2839.28 → 2840.40] What this viewer
[2840.40 → 2841.14] Meant to say
[2841.14 → 2842.94] There you go
[2842.94 → 2843.74] Interesting
[2843.74 → 2846.38] Speaking of PS4
[2846.38 → 2848.40] And streaming games
[2848.40 → 2849.06] Over the internet
[2849.06 → 2849.80] Let's talk about
[2849.80 → 2850.64] That Sony thing
[2850.64 → 2852.68] Oh
[2852.68 → 2853.60] Okay
[2853.60 → 2854.46] Where is this?
[2854.54 → 2855.34] Let's pull up the thing
[2855.34 → 2855.66] Right
[2855.66 → 2856.12] Right
[2856.12 → 2856.32] Right
[2856.32 → 2857.46] We have the new system
[2857.46 → 2857.76] For this
[2857.76 → 2858.26] Sony in I believe
[2858.26 → 2858.74] Japan
[2858.74 → 2859.86] Is rolling out
[2859.86 → 2861.92] Two gigabit internet
[2861.92 → 2863.80] Which will bring fibre
[2863.80 → 2864.90] Directly to your house
[2864.90 → 2865.96] And then each house
[2865.96 → 2866.92] Will need its own
[2866.92 → 2868.28] Something box
[2868.28 → 2868.84] That I don't remember
[2868.84 → 2869.38] The name of
[2869.38 → 2870.20] That will convert
[2870.20 → 2870.98] The fibre to
[2870.98 → 2872.14] ONU box
[2872.14 → 2873.24] That will convert
[2873.24 → 2874.10] The fibre to
[2874.10 → 2875.48] Proper Ethernet
[2875.48 → 2877.40] So this was a news story
[2877.40 → 2878.40] Submitted on the Linus
[2878.40 → 2879.10] Tech Tips forum
[2879.10 → 2881.44] By VRB747
[2881.44 → 2885.16] And the most obvious question
[2885.16 → 2886.08] That I've heard from people
[2886.08 → 2887.46] Is what could anyone possibly
[2887.46 → 2888.98] Need two gigabit internet for?
[2889.82 → 2891.54] Most computers these days
[2891.54 → 2893.08] Come with a one gigabit connection
[2893.08 → 2893.68] In the back
[2893.68 → 2895.36] To which I would reply
[2895.36 → 2896.50] Well guys
[2896.50 → 2897.78] Lots of households
[2897.78 → 2899.98] Have more than one computer now
[2899.98 → 2903.04] So
[2903.04 → 2903.36] Your
[2903.36 → 2905.32] Winks are horrible
[2905.32 → 2907.34] You're so bad
[2907.34 → 2911.28] Anyway
[2911.28 → 2912.62] It's like
[2912.62 → 2913.36] You don't have to wink
[2913.36 → 2914.32] With your whole face
[2914.32 → 2915.48] I can't otherwise
[2915.48 → 2916.40] Oh really?
[2916.48 → 2917.42] Yeah I legit can't
[2917.42 → 2917.70] Oh
[2917.70 → 2918.80] Yeah I have like a condition
[2918.80 → 2919.70] Oh
[2919.70 → 2920.00] It's called
[2920.00 → 2921.12] Not able to winkings
[2921.12 → 2923.46] It's the only way I can
[2923.46 → 2924.00] Sorry Mike
[2924.00 → 2925.10] That was probably really loud
[2925.10 → 2926.88] So anyway
[2926.88 → 2928.12] So VRB747
[2928.12 → 2929.52] Thank you for contributing that
[2929.52 → 2930.56] To the news section
[2930.56 → 2931.74] Of the Linus Tech Tips forum
[2931.74 → 2932.16] Guys
[2932.16 → 2933.90] Do check out the news section
[2933.90 → 2934.84] It's gotten to the point
[2934.84 → 2936.60] Where I think over the last month or so
[2936.60 → 2938.18] Traffic in that section
[2938.18 → 2939.66] Has about 10x
[2939.66 → 2941.08] Which is
[2941.08 → 2942.18] Which is outstanding
[2942.18 → 2943.24] Because it's turning
[2943.24 → 2944.22] The Linus Tech Tips forum
[2944.22 → 2945.38] Into a great place to go
[2945.38 → 2946.92] To check out the latest news
[2946.92 → 2947.70] By the way
[2947.70 → 2948.88] It goes in the
[2948.88 → 2950.64] Tech news and reviews section
[2950.64 → 2952.32] Not the forum news
[2952.32 → 2954.68] We should probably clarify that
[2954.68 → 2955.32] At some point
[2955.32 → 2956.64] I'm probably going to lock off
[2956.64 → 2957.28] Forum news
[2957.28 → 2958.22] Clarify it like butter
[2958.22 → 2959.02] And make it so that people
[2959.02 → 2960.18] Can't create new topics
[2960.18 → 2961.18] Because realistically
[2961.18 → 2962.16] You're just supposed to be
[2962.16 → 2963.00] Commenting on topics
[2963.00 → 2963.72] That are already there
[2963.72 → 2964.40] Right
[2964.40 → 2965.48] But that'll probably be
[2965.48 → 2965.80] When the new forum comes out
[2965.80 → 2966.22] What if you changed it
[2966.22 → 2968.28] To forum news and announcements
[2968.28 → 2969.88] Or something like that
[2969.88 → 2970.78] So that it's more clear
[2970.78 → 2971.64] Maybe
[2971.64 → 2972.24] Okay
[2972.24 → 2972.84] We'll figure it out
[2972.84 → 2973.84] But that section is not
[2973.84 → 2974.90] Actually for news
[2974.90 → 2977.18] From the random community
[2977.18 → 2978.54] That is only for forum news
[2978.54 → 2979.44] I'm not done talking about
[2979.44 → 2980.24] Two gigabit internet
[2980.24 → 2981.26] So basically
[2981.26 → 2982.24] Sony is going to be
[2982.24 → 2983.02] Bringing fibre
[2983.02 → 2984.66] Right into your house
[2984.68 → 2986.80] For the low cost
[2986.80 → 2987.56] Of what are they charging
[2987.56 → 2988.96] 50 bucks a month
[2988.96 → 2990.36] 50 or 60 or something
[2990.36 → 2991.44] 50 or 60 bucks a month
[2991.44 → 2992.64] Which I saw a few people
[2992.64 → 2993.56] In the twitch chat
[2993.56 → 2994.02] Go like
[2994.02 → 2995.00] Oh, but it's
[2995.00 → 2995.88] That expensive
[2995.88 → 2996.80] Man
[2996.80 → 2998.92] We pay that much
[2998.92 → 2999.42] For like
[2999.42 → 3000.96] High-end plans
[3000.96 → 3001.58] Not cool internet
[3001.58 → 3003.34] Like 15 megabit down
[3003.34 → 3003.96] What is it
[3003.96 → 3004.96] 512k up
[3004.96 → 3005.80] Or 1 Meg up
[3005.80 → 3007.20] It's not good
[3007.20 → 3008.22] Might be 512k up
[3008.22 → 3008.62] I think
[3008.62 → 3009.94] For like the $60 plan
[3009.94 → 3010.54] On Shaw
[3010.54 → 3011.00] Yeah
[3011.00 → 3012.08] So like that's
[3012.08 → 3013.04] Incredible
[3013.04 → 3014.20] Depends on where you live
[3014.20 → 3016.14] Maybe you have a better situation
[3016.14 → 3017.10] Here's the question
[3017.10 → 3017.82] Not so much
[3017.82 → 3019.22] Let's continue our conversation
[3019.22 → 3020.08] From last week
[3020.08 → 3022.06] Would you cut off a toe
[3022.06 → 3023.46] For two gigabit internet
[3023.46 → 3023.96] For
[3023.96 → 3024.84] Which toe?
[3025.66 → 3026.30] Picky toe yes
[3026.30 → 3026.72] Middle toe
[3026.72 → 3028.52] Do you even need that one?
[3028.58 → 3029.08] Don't think so
[3029.08 → 3030.94] Would you cut off a middle toe
[3030.94 → 3031.78] Like would
[3031.78 → 3032.52] Okay hold on
[3032.52 → 3033.64] I'm going to make it gruesome though
[3033.64 → 3034.76] Would you like
[3034.76 → 3035.68] Consciously
[3035.68 → 3036.66] Without numbing
[3036.66 → 3037.86] Cut off your middle toe
[3037.86 → 3038.08] No
[3038.08 → 3039.00] What if it was free
[3039.00 → 3039.94] For the rest of your life?
[3040.66 → 3041.74] But then that won't be
[3041.74 → 3042.80] That high performance
[3042.80 → 3043.88] But you'll be high performance
[3043.88 → 3045.06] For an awful long time
[3045.06 → 3046.36] Two gigabit internet
[3046.36 → 3047.04] On fibre
[3047.04 → 3047.68] Is going to be
[3047.68 → 3048.20] Low latency
[3048.20 → 3048.94] And high performance
[3048.94 → 3050.58] For a very long time
[3050.58 → 3052.02] Hmm
[3052.02 → 3053.90] Hmm
[3053.90 → 3056.06] Would it scale
[3056.06 → 3057.14] Would it scale?
[3057.50 → 3058.54] Let's say it scales
[3058.54 → 3059.20] It scales?
[3059.30 → 3060.08] Let's say it scales
[3060.08 → 3060.82] You would cut off
[3060.82 → 3061.32] Your middle toe
[3061.32 → 3062.08] Is there a bandwidth cap?
[3062.08 → 3063.16] You would look at it
[3063.16 → 3064.32] Is there a bandwidth cap?
[3064.90 → 3065.54] Bandwidth cap?
[3065.60 → 3066.08] Let's say no
[3066.08 → 3067.94] Maybe
[3067.94 → 3069.74] I might chicken out
[3069.74 → 3070.12] Like
[3070.12 → 3070.82] Like
[3070.82 → 3072.28] Like you have to use
[3072.28 → 3073.48] Like bolt cutters
[3073.48 → 3074.22] Really?
[3074.40 → 3074.64] Yeah
[3074.64 → 3075.74] Why are you making this so horrible?
[3075.74 → 3076.88] It has to be gruesome
[3076.88 → 3077.98] Why does it have to be gruesome?
[3078.00 → 3078.50] But like just
[3078.50 → 3078.90] Hold on
[3078.90 → 3079.14] No, no
[3079.14 → 3079.38] Just
[3079.38 → 3080.24] But okay
[3080.24 → 3080.98] There's a
[3080.98 → 3082.36] There's trained medical staff
[3082.36 → 3083.26] Next to you
[3083.26 → 3084.22] Ready to go
[3084.22 → 3086.04] Would they put me out
[3086.04 → 3086.86] Right after I do it?
[3087.64 → 3088.34] Because I'm pretty sure
[3088.34 → 3089.04] You'd put someone under
[3089.04 → 3090.10] If their toe is missing
[3090.10 → 3091.32] I don't think so
[3091.32 → 3091.62] Really?
[3091.92 → 3092.34] Yeah why?
[3092.80 → 3093.16] Because it's so painful
[3093.16 → 3094.06] They'd probably just locally
[3094.06 → 3095.36] Because you might go into shock
[3095.36 → 3097.36] Local anesthetic?
[3097.44 → 3097.86] Okay whatever
[3097.86 → 3098.32] They're going to do
[3098.32 → 3099.16] Whatever they need to do
[3099.16 → 3100.50] I'm not a medical professional
[3100.50 → 3101.06] I don't know
[3101.06 → 3101.82] Not at all
[3101.82 → 3102.78] So don't listen to me
[3102.78 → 3103.92] But bolt cutters on the toe
[3103.92 → 3104.54] Would you do it
[3104.54 → 3105.66] For two gig internet now
[3105.66 → 3106.22] And it scales
[3106.22 → 3108.08] See I would like to say yes
[3108.08 → 3108.72] Right now
[3108.72 → 3109.68] But honestly
[3109.68 → 3111.00] I think a lot of people
[3111.00 → 3111.92] Say yes
[3111.92 → 3112.98] Outside of situations
[3112.98 → 3113.66] And if you actually
[3113.66 → 3114.42] Sat them down
[3114.42 → 3114.88] In like
[3114.88 → 3116.26] Here are the bolt cutters
[3116.26 → 3116.48] It's you
[3116.48 → 3117.98] I will go get the bolt cutters
[3117.98 → 3118.88] You'd probably have me
[3118.88 → 3119.64] In a barn
[3119.64 → 3122.10] In like a metal chair
[3122.10 → 3123.50] In like the most gruesome
[3123.50 → 3124.20] Creepy situation possible
[3124.20 → 3125.16] You're making this sound
[3125.16 → 3126.12] Terrible
[3126.12 → 3126.90] You'd probably
[3126.90 → 3127.98] Why would I have you
[3127.98 → 3128.44] In a barn
[3128.44 → 3129.28] In a metal chair?
[3129.50 → 3130.16] Oh god
[3130.16 → 3130.56] What?
[3130.86 → 3131.94] Why'd you have to take it there?
[3132.00 → 3133.28] Why did you take it there?
[3134.00 → 3134.46] No, no no
[3134.46 → 3135.42] I meant like
[3135.42 → 3136.28] I meant like
[3136.28 → 3137.32] What's his name?
[3137.40 → 3138.76] I said there are medical professionals
[3138.76 → 3139.72] Would you like to play a game?
[3140.32 → 3140.50] What?
[3141.36 → 3142.00] What's his
[3142.00 → 3143.22] Would you like to play a game?
[3143.28 → 3144.04] That's his tagline
[3144.04 → 3145.88] There are multiple movies
[3145.88 → 3147.68] Chucky?
[3148.22 → 3148.62] No!
[3149.02 → 3149.36] I don't know
[3149.36 → 3150.52] I've never seen a horror movie
[3150.52 → 3150.86] Way more recent
[3150.86 → 3151.60] Maybe my
[3151.60 → 3152.64] I don't know horror movies
[3152.64 → 3153.00] Saw!
[3153.72 → 3154.60] Twitch chat knows
[3154.60 → 3155.38] Twitch chat knows everything
[3155.38 → 3156.74] Twitch chat does know everything actually
[3156.74 → 3157.02] Saw
[3157.02 → 3157.56] Saw
[3157.56 → 3158.32] Have you heard of
[3158.32 → 3159.08] You've heard of Saw right?
[3159.08 → 3159.74] I've heard of
[3159.74 → 3160.26] Never seen
[3160.26 → 3161.28] Would you like to play a game?
[3161.84 → 3162.10] Yeah
[3162.10 → 3163.66] It's all creepy and all messed up
[3163.66 → 3165.08] I feel like you would have that
[3165.08 → 3165.98] Weird creepiness
[3165.98 → 3166.76] Messed up factor
[3166.76 → 3168.96] But you'd get 2 gigabit internet out of it
[3168.96 → 3170.82] But I think by the time I sat down
[3170.82 → 3171.98] I might chicken out
[3171.98 → 3173.26] But I would like to say yes now
[3173.26 → 3174.76] I think there's a one time fee
[3174.76 → 3177.06] To actually get it into your house
[3177.06 → 3178.12] That's probably pretty brutal
[3178.12 → 3179.40] Which is probably pretty brutal
[3179.40 → 3180.16] But I mean
[3180.16 → 3180.86] That's sort of
[3180.86 → 3182.08] That's sort of life
[3182.08 → 3184.48] I think you have to subsidize stuff like this a little bit
[3184.48 → 3186.52] I think we're an awful long way away from Canada
[3186.52 → 3188.82] Reaching this level of internet connectivity
[3188.82 → 3191.40] But the reason I did segue into this
[3191.40 → 3193.68] Is that this level of internet
[3193.68 → 3195.50] 2 gigabit per second
[3195.50 → 3197.06] Low latency
[3197.06 → 3197.80] Fibre
[3197.80 → 3199.72] It would be capable
[3199.72 → 3200.78] Of streaming games
[3200.78 → 3205.04] It's coming
[3205.04 → 3208.66] But the place that has always had the fastest internet has it
[3208.66 → 3210.04] And nowhere else has it
[3210.04 → 3212.30] And it's going to take so long
[3212.30 → 3213.52] For other places to transition
[3213.52 → 3215.98] But you look at companies like Nintendo and Sony
[3215.98 → 3217.02] These Japanese companies
[3217.02 → 3218.62] How many cares do they give exactly
[3218.62 → 3221.70] That only Japan can use a lot of the technology they build
[3221.70 → 3222.36] Yeah
[3222.36 → 3224.10] None
[3224.10 → 3224.60] Yeah
[3224.60 → 3225.36] Zero
[3225.36 → 3226.98] So that means
[3226.98 → 3228.24] There will be customers
[3228.24 → 3229.86] For NVIDIA's grid technology
[3229.86 → 3232.08] Which is their cloud-based gaming
[3232.08 → 3234.16] So remote gaming service
[3234.16 → 3235.92] So there will be customers
[3235.92 → 3238.42] There will be grids being deployed
[3238.42 → 3239.56] It will be a real thing
[3239.56 → 3240.32] Very soon
[3240.32 → 3241.54] I'm interested to see
[3241.54 → 3244.30] How many massive outages there are
[3244.30 → 3248.08] Because it doesn't matter at all
[3248.08 → 3249.14] What backend you have
[3249.14 → 3251.10] Every single big launch
[3251.10 → 3252.42] In so long
[3252.42 → 3253.70] Has had failure launches
[3253.70 → 3255.14] Because no servers can support it
[3255.14 → 3255.52] Okay
[3255.52 → 3256.54] Well would it be any different
[3256.54 → 3257.66] Than already it is then
[3257.66 → 3258.70] It's going to be worse
[3258.70 → 3259.68] You think so?
[3261.06 → 3261.42] Ah
[3261.42 → 3264.38] Apparently there are people coming home
[3264.38 → 3264.66] So
[3264.66 → 3266.42] A fairly large group of random
[3266.42 → 3267.30] Just pulled up
[3267.30 → 3270.02] But it's way more server power
[3270.02 → 3270.58] Because they have to do
[3270.58 → 3271.72] All the graphics rendering
[3271.72 → 3272.44] On their end
[3272.44 → 3273.08] Right
[3273.08 → 3273.92] That's nuts
[3273.92 → 3275.10] But that won't affect network
[3275.10 → 3276.46] Doesn't matter
[3276.46 → 3277.82] The server backbone
[3277.82 → 3278.98] Will not be able to do it
[3278.98 → 3280.18] Alright well
[3280.18 → 3281.30] Nowhere even close
[3281.30 → 3282.62] Like the graphics power
[3282.62 → 3283.22] To power all that
[3283.22 → 3284.08] Is going to be nuts
[3284.08 → 3285.58] How few people are going to have
[3285.58 → 3287.00] Two gigabit connections though
[3287.00 → 3288.72] Are those people going to overpower
[3288.72 → 3289.94] I think there will be a slow ramp
[3289.94 → 3290.74] They'll have time
[3290.74 → 3291.34] Like all of Japan
[3291.34 → 3292.28] They're going to have time to build
[3292.28 → 3293.64] Like 40 supercomputers
[3293.64 → 3294.32] On top of each other
[3294.32 → 3296.28] It's going to be nuts
[3296.28 → 3298.32] I think
[3298.32 → 3299.72] I think we're far from it
[3299.72 → 3300.86] Like very far from it
[3300.86 → 3301.84] Because of graphics power
[3301.84 → 3303.04] You and I can agree to disagree
[3303.04 → 3303.96] The network backbone
[3303.96 → 3304.68] Is definitely there
[3304.68 → 3305.14] You're right
[3305.14 → 3306.66] But graphics power
[3306.66 → 3307.62] For all those people
[3307.62 → 3308.28] Is going to be nuts
[3308.28 → 3309.38] Because people are going to be like
[3309.38 → 3309.80] Okay
[3309.80 → 3310.60] I'm playing at like
[3310.60 → 3311.50] Five frames per second
[3311.50 → 3312.22] This is retarded
[3312.22 → 3314.36] Pay more
[3314.36 → 3315.76] Get more frames
[3315.76 → 3316.70] Oh
[3316.70 → 3318.12] Huh?
[3318.24 → 3318.46] Oh
[3318.46 → 3320.32] Wow
[3320.32 → 3321.20] Free to play
[3321.20 → 3322.54] But when you connect
[3322.54 → 3323.28] It's super slow
[3323.28 → 3323.98] So you suck
[3323.98 → 3325.58] Or when you connect
[3325.58 → 3326.74] It plays at like
[3326.74 → 3327.56] 480p
[3327.56 → 3329.02] Or like 320p
[3329.02 → 3329.70] Right
[3329.70 → 3330.38] And then you upgrade
[3330.38 → 3331.72] To a premium account
[3331.72 → 3332.68] To make it look bad
[3332.68 → 3333.92] Or like an Uber premium account
[3333.92 → 3335.00] To get more graphics horsepower
[3335.00 → 3335.94] And then maybe
[3335.94 → 3336.86] Maybe it's
[3336.86 → 3338.04] You're actually accessing
[3338.04 → 3338.96] The server
[3338.96 → 3340.08] So you pay like
[3340.08 → 3340.88] Monthly fees
[3340.88 → 3341.68] Based on how good
[3341.68 → 3342.98] You want your connection to be
[3342.98 → 3344.46] And you get to play
[3344.46 → 3345.40] All your games at that rate
[3345.40 → 3345.80] It's coming
[3345.80 → 3348.62] They'll do tons of stuff
[3348.62 → 3348.76] Like that
[3348.76 → 3349.90] They'll do tons of stuff
[3349.90 → 3350.36] That's brutal
[3350.36 → 3351.18] It will scale
[3351.18 → 3352.12] It will be just
[3352.12 → 3353.36] Like the most bazaar
[3353.36 → 3354.30] Head turning thing ever
[3354.30 → 3355.00] Because that would really help
[3355.00 → 3357.48] Them manage the graphics power
[3357.48 → 3358.28] It would help them manage
[3358.28 → 3358.88] The graphics power
[3358.88 → 3359.90] And network
[3359.90 → 3360.56] Yep
[3360.56 → 3361.06] Of course
[3361.06 → 3362.20] Both of them
[3362.20 → 3362.86] And they could just be like
[3362.86 → 3363.08] LOL
[3363.08 → 3364.26] 260p
[3364.26 → 3364.94] 480p
[3364.94 → 3365.60] Exactly
[3365.60 → 3367.32] And for some games
[3367.32 → 3367.92] It wouldn't matter
[3367.92 → 3368.42] Wii tennis
[3368.42 → 3368.86] Who cares
[3368.86 → 3369.68] Yeah
[3369.68 → 3370.04] Yeah
[3370.04 → 3371.38] Okay
[3371.38 → 3373.04] So here's a big thing
[3373.04 → 3374.00] Foxconn
[3374.00 → 3374.94] Oh I forgot to put down
[3374.94 → 3375.72] The link for this one
[3375.72 → 3376.44] Okay well
[3376.44 → 3377.44] Crap
[3377.44 → 3378.68] I forget where I saw this link
[3378.68 → 3379.82] But Foxconn
[3379.82 → 3381.28] Has settled with Microsoft
[3381.28 → 3382.96] Over Android licensing fees
[3382.96 → 3384.70] So this is fascinating
[3384.70 → 3385.10] Because
[3385.10 → 3386.66] The rumour has it
[3386.66 → 3387.12] That the
[3387.12 → 3388.12] Because Microsoft's
[3388.12 → 3389.30] Already settled with a couple of guys
[3389.30 → 3390.88] And the rumour has it
[3390.88 → 3392.62] That Microsoft is extracting
[3392.62 → 3393.36] As much as
[3393.36 → 3394.90] Ten dollars or more
[3394.90 → 3396.72] Per Android device
[3396.72 → 3400.02] In software licensing fees
[3400.02 → 3401.76] How many cares
[3401.76 → 3403.02] Does Microsoft give
[3403.02 → 3404.04] About Windows Phone 8
[3404.04 → 3404.58] At that point
[3404.58 → 3407.06] Honestly
[3407.06 → 3408.18] I mean I'm sure they care
[3408.18 → 3409.26] They care
[3409.26 → 3409.70] But like
[3409.70 → 3410.50] Oh yeah
[3410.50 → 3411.60] You guys are making phones
[3411.60 → 3412.14] Good job
[3412.14 → 3412.94] Good job
[3412.94 → 3414.12] Because we're up to
[3414.12 → 3415.10] What was the new number
[3415.10 → 3417.06] One billion total Android devices
[3417.06 → 3417.66] Shipped to date
[3417.66 → 3419.36] Was it to date
[3419.36 → 3420.16] I thought they said
[3420.16 → 3420.98] They were going to ship
[3420.98 → 3421.96] A billion this year
[3421.96 → 3422.62] Okay
[3422.62 → 3423.98] I don't think it's going to be
[3423.98 → 3424.78] A billion this year
[3424.78 → 3425.54] That's a lot
[3425.54 → 3427.12] I don't remember what it was
[3427.12 → 3427.64] Anyway
[3427.64 → 3428.50] Something to do with
[3428.50 → 3428.94] Twitch chat go
[3428.94 → 3429.90] Something to do with
[3429.90 → 3430.28] A billion
[3430.28 → 3431.56] And something to do with
[3431.56 → 3433.20] About over half
[3433.20 → 3434.68] Of Android devices
[3434.68 → 3435.32] Are apparently
[3435.32 → 3436.80] Being tacked on
[3436.80 → 3438.30] With Microsoft licensing fees
[3438.30 → 3438.98] According to
[3438.98 → 3439.96] A Microsoft rep
[3439.96 → 3441.10] So there's that
[3441.10 → 3442.86] So if they sell
[3442.86 → 3443.72] Another billion
[3443.72 → 3444.78] Within a much shorter
[3444.78 → 3445.46] Period of time
[3445.46 → 3446.06] Looking at the way
[3446.06 → 3446.98] Sales are ramping
[3446.98 → 3448.14] Microsoft will be
[3448.14 → 3449.02] Collecting exactly
[3449.02 → 3449.82] That many
[3449.82 → 3451.22] Billions of dollars
[3451.22 → 3452.68] Just for sitting
[3452.68 → 3453.66] On their butts
[3453.66 → 3454.38] Watching Android
[3454.38 → 3454.80] Outsell
[3454.80 → 3455.50] Everything else
[3455.50 → 3458.34] I've had people say
[3458.34 → 3460.26] One billion by the end
[3460.26 → 3460.56] Of the year
[3460.56 → 3461.92] And I've had people say
[3461.92 → 3463.58] One billion
[3463.58 → 3465.18] To this date
[3465.18 → 3466.30] And I've had
[3466.30 → 3467.06] More than one person
[3467.06 → 3467.54] Say though
[3467.54 → 3469.06] 1.5 million activations
[3469.06 → 3469.62] A day
[3469.62 → 3472.94] Which is nuts
[3472.94 → 3474.02] Wow
[3474.02 → 3474.76] Because that means
[3474.76 → 3475.34] What?
[3475.70 → 3476.36] Microsoft's getting
[3476.36 → 3477.32] Fifteen million dollars
[3477.32 → 3477.70] A day
[3477.70 → 3479.56] For not making things
[3479.56 → 3483.66] That's so balling
[3483.66 → 3484.36] Well no less than that
[3484.36 → 3485.00] Because they were saying
[3485.00 → 3485.94] More than half
[3485.94 → 3486.48] So let's say
[3486.48 → 3487.14] Seven and a half
[3487.14 → 3488.10] Million dollars a day
[3488.10 → 3488.54] Still
[3488.54 → 3490.28] For not actually
[3490.28 → 3491.04] Making anything
[3491.04 → 3491.68] That's awesome
[3491.68 → 3492.58] No R&D
[3492.58 → 3493.78] That they haven't
[3493.78 → 3494.68] Already done years ago
[3494.68 → 3494.94] Right
[3494.94 → 3497.30] No tooling of the device
[3497.30 → 3497.92] Do they care
[3497.92 → 3498.88] If they don't sell Surface?
[3499.28 → 3499.62] Because they
[3499.62 → 3501.62] Microsoft was actually
[3501.62 → 3502.70] This tied into
[3502.70 → 3503.84] One of our other topics
[3503.84 → 3504.74] From last week
[3504.74 → 3505.80] Which was
[3505.80 → 3507.26] The report that
[3507.26 → 3508.36] The PC was dead
[3508.36 → 3509.66] And iPad was killing it
[3509.66 → 3510.60] And PC sales were down
[3510.60 → 3511.26] Fourteen percent
[3511.26 → 3512.50] And then a report
[3512.50 → 3513.34] Came out this week
[3513.34 → 3514.82] That Microsoft's profits
[3514.82 → 3515.58] Were up something like
[3515.58 → 3516.40] Fourteen percent
[3516.40 → 3517.10] Or seventeen percent
[3517.10 → 3517.84] Or something like that
[3517.84 → 3519.18] I can't remember
[3519.18 → 3520.50] We don't have it in there
[3520.50 → 3520.80] I don't think
[3520.80 → 3521.30] It ever made it
[3521.30 → 3522.02] To our stream
[3522.02 → 3523.20] Outline
[3523.20 → 3524.30] But I'm kind of
[3524.30 → 3524.64] Looking at it
[3524.64 → 3525.36] Going yeah
[3525.36 → 3527.36] I don't think
[3527.36 → 3528.20] They actually
[3528.20 → 3529.46] Mind if not
[3529.46 → 3530.30] Too many copies
[3530.30 → 3531.18] Of Windows 8
[3531.18 → 3531.64] So
[3531.64 → 3532.74] So just like
[3532.74 → 3534.98] Microsoft will survive
[3534.98 → 3535.58] That's something
[3535.58 → 3536.24] We've learned
[3536.24 → 3537.06] They'll be fine
[3537.06 → 3537.60] They're figuring
[3537.60 → 3538.48] I mean they're figuring
[3538.48 → 3539.56] Out content distribution
[3539.56 → 3540.12] With things like
[3540.12 → 3541.04] The Xbox Music
[3541.04 → 3541.70] Store
[3541.70 → 3542.90] They're figuring out
[3542.90 → 3543.30] Gaming
[3543.30 → 3544.50] In a way that I
[3544.50 → 3545.40] Think Sony
[3545.40 → 3546.68] Kind of forgot
[3546.68 → 3548.68] So they're figuring
[3548.68 → 3548.96] Out that
[3548.96 → 3549.62] They're figuring out
[3549.62 → 3550.16] Finally
[3550.16 → 3551.24] I mean they tried
[3551.24 → 3552.56] With Media Centre PC
[3552.56 → 3554.70] That was 2002
[3554.70 → 3556.90] XP Media Centre
[3556.90 → 3557.56] No, no
[3557.56 → 3558.38] The PC will be
[3558.38 → 3559.00] An integral part
[3559.00 → 3559.60] Of the home
[3559.60 → 3561.06] Living room environment
[3561.06 → 3561.62] And here we are
[3561.62 → 3562.86] Over ten years later
[3562.86 → 3563.60] And it looks like
[3563.60 → 3564.42] The next gen Xbox
[3564.42 → 3565.62] Might actually
[3565.62 → 3567.16] Finally get there
[3567.16 → 3568.42] But they've been
[3568.42 → 3569.02] Determined
[3569.02 → 3569.80] That they're
[3569.80 → 3570.56] Going to do it
[3570.56 → 3571.92] So they're finally
[3571.92 → 3572.80] Getting to that point
[3572.80 → 3573.76] I'm not worried
[3573.76 → 3574.48] For Microsoft
[3574.48 → 3575.60] Media Centre PC
[3575.60 → 3576.32] Was pretty cool
[3576.32 → 3576.78] But like
[3576.78 → 3577.34] How many people
[3577.34 → 3577.70] Did you know
[3577.70 → 3578.28] That had one
[3578.28 → 3581.04] Right
[3581.04 → 3581.72] So one
[3581.72 → 3581.96] Right
[3581.96 → 3582.48] Yourself
[3582.48 → 3583.00] Two
[3583.00 → 3583.46] Two
[3583.46 → 3584.24] My parents
[3584.24 → 3586.16] And my
[3586.16 → 3587.40] Then girlfriend's
[3587.40 → 3587.88] Parents
[3587.88 → 3588.78] So it's because
[3588.78 → 3589.96] You distributed it
[3589.96 → 3590.34] For them
[3590.34 → 3590.88] Right
[3590.88 → 3592.52] That's pretty much
[3592.52 → 3593.18] The same experience
[3593.18 → 3593.92] That I had
[3593.92 → 3596.22] Whatever man
[3596.22 → 3596.94] It's like
[3596.94 → 3598.32] Places that I
[3598.32 → 3599.00] Put it in
[3599.00 → 3600.18] That's the only
[3600.18 → 3600.82] Places I knew
[3600.82 → 3601.16] It existed
[3601.16 → 3601.78] Places that I
[3601.78 → 3602.30] Put it in
[3602.30 → 3603.02] And then went
[3603.02 → 3603.64] And helped them
[3603.64 → 3604.42] Fix it over
[3604.42 → 3605.04] And over
[3605.04 → 3605.52] And over
[3605.52 → 3605.94] Again
[3605.94 → 3607.86] Yeah
[3607.86 → 3608.72] Oh I have to
[3608.72 → 3609.38] Restart it again
[3609.38 → 3610.46] Oh it's Windows
[3610.46 → 3611.30] Oh
[3611.30 → 3613.92] We should do
[3613.92 → 3614.64] What time is it
[3614.64 → 3615.70] We should do
[3615.70 → 3616.62] The rest of our
[3616.62 → 3617.62] Community news items
[3617.62 → 3618.14] Yeah
[3618.14 → 3619.44] Community news items
[3619.44 → 3621.18] Here we go
[3621.18 → 3622.28] So for those of you
[3622.28 → 3623.50] Who haven't seen this
[3623.50 → 3624.62] This is frigging awesome
[3624.62 → 3625.16] Why don't you
[3625.16 → 3625.72] Why don't you
[3625.72 → 3627.10] Why don't you
[3627.10 → 3627.56] Do this one
[3627.56 → 3628.50] Joe Z
[3628.50 → 3629.64] From the forum
[3629.64 → 3630.72] Posted
[3630.72 → 3632.82] The
[3632.82 → 3634.18] The Bit Labs
[3634.18 → 3634.58] Article
[3634.58 → 3635.42] About the
[3635.42 → 3636.78] 7990 Malta
[3636.78 → 3637.70] Being available
[3637.70 → 3638.62] Through an eBay sale
[3638.62 → 3639.40] It is prohibited
[3639.40 → 3640.88] To sell
[3640.88 → 3641.74] Engineering sample
[3641.74 → 3642.60] Items on eBay
[3642.60 → 3644.06] And just in general
[3644.06 → 3645.02] It's just not
[3645.02 → 3645.68] Really okay
[3645.68 → 3647.04] So here
[3647.04 → 3647.48] I'll let you
[3647.48 → 3647.98] Take over
[3647.98 → 3648.38] I'm just gonna
[3648.38 → 3648.82] Go find out
[3648.82 → 3649.46] Who that is
[3649.46 → 3650.30] At the house
[3650.30 → 3650.40] Yeah
[3650.40 → 3651.30] That's probably
[3651.30 → 3651.96] Not a bad idea
[3651.96 → 3653.16] Before all of our
[3653.16 → 3653.80] Stuff goes missing
[3653.80 → 3654.18] And we can't
[3654.18 → 3654.92] Make videos anymore
[3654.92 → 3656.26] Anyway
[3656.26 → 3657.20] So this guy
[3657.20 → 3657.74] Puts up
[3657.74 → 3659.04] A 7990 Malta
[3659.04 → 3659.64] On eBay
[3659.64 → 3660.76] And expects it
[3660.76 → 3661.56] To actually work
[3661.56 → 3662.26] Or
[3662.26 → 3663.30] He's trolling
[3663.30 → 3663.94] I'm not really sure
[3663.94 → 3664.74] Either he's
[3664.74 → 3665.50] He's an idiot
[3665.50 → 3666.64] Or he thought
[3666.64 → 3667.24] It would be funny
[3667.24 → 3667.96] I think that's
[3667.96 → 3668.58] Really all that
[3668.58 → 3669.64] Is left to that
[3669.64 → 3670.56] Um
[3670.56 → 3671.46] But yeah
[3671.46 → 3672.04] It got up to
[3672.04 → 3672.68] How much
[3672.68 → 3673.32] Let me check this
[3673.32 → 3673.92] Really quick
[3673.92 → 3675.06] Guy on the forum
[3675.06 → 3675.60] Mentioned it
[3675.60 → 3677.58] 96,100
[3677.58 → 3680.98] From IP changer
[3680.98 → 3681.90] Or charger
[3681.90 → 3682.64] That's
[3682.64 → 3683.62] That's insane
[3683.62 → 3684.68] I brought that up
[3684.68 → 3685.50] With Linus earlier
[3685.50 → 3686.10] And he mentioned
[3686.10 → 3686.92] That it was probably
[3686.92 → 3687.76] Someone trolling
[3687.76 → 3688.58] They weren't
[3688.58 → 3689.68] Actually going to pay
[3689.68 → 3690.12] That much
[3690.12 → 3691.98] I don't know
[3691.98 → 3692.98] I think that might
[3692.98 → 3693.68] Have been legitimate
[3693.68 → 3694.72] Which is terrible
[3694.72 → 3695.82] Because even if
[3695.82 → 3697.22] You make a review
[3697.22 → 3697.86] Of it
[3697.86 → 3698.36] Or anything
[3698.36 → 3698.94] You're not gonna
[3698.94 → 3699.46] Make back
[3699.46 → 3700.36] Anywhere close
[3700.36 → 3700.78] To that amount
[3700.78 → 3701.08] Of money
[3701.08 → 3702.10] Like
[3702.10 → 3703.18] Nowhere even
[3703.18 → 3703.90] Remotely close
[3703.90 → 3704.30] To that amount
[3704.30 → 3704.62] Of money
[3704.62 → 3705.52] Not even
[3705.52 → 3707.44] Not even on the same scale
[3707.44 → 3708.30] Like you couldn't
[3708.30 → 3709.38] Weigh those against each other
[3709.38 → 3710.34] And the funny thing is
[3710.34 → 3711.72] Unless you're a reviewer
[3711.72 → 3712.58] Unless you have
[3712.58 → 3713.52] Some kind of hookup
[3713.52 → 3715.06] You can't get drivers for it
[3715.06 → 3715.94] Yeah
[3715.94 → 3717.40] You actually
[3717.40 → 3718.84] Won't be able to run it
[3718.84 → 3719.96] Until the embargo lifts
[3719.96 → 3720.74] I would hope
[3720.74 → 3721.62] That that guy
[3721.62 → 3722.46] Would at least
[3722.46 → 3723.78] Give you a driver with it
[3723.78 → 3725.38] Maybe it ships
[3725.38 → 3726.26] With a USB driver
[3726.26 → 3727.40] Might not have one
[3727.40 → 3727.88] Um
[3727.88 → 3728.16] No
[3728.16 → 3729.46] No usually they don't
[3729.46 → 3730.34] You've seen how they
[3730.34 → 3731.00] Distribute the drivers
[3731.00 → 3731.44] No I know
[3731.44 → 3732.04] Through
[3732.04 → 3732.64] Yeah
[3732.64 → 3733.44] Through like an FTP
[3733.44 → 3734.12] Or whatever else
[3734.12 → 3734.64] Download it
[3734.64 → 3735.52] Put it on a USB drive
[3735.52 → 3735.92] And ship it
[3735.92 → 3736.28] With your
[3736.28 → 3738.00] $96,000
[3738.00 → 3738.74] I mean it must have
[3738.74 → 3739.18] Been a joke
[3739.18 → 3740.06] I think you could
[3740.06 → 3740.78] Give the guy
[3740.78 → 3741.28] Freaking
[3741.28 → 3742.60] A flash drive
[3742.60 → 3743.48] For his
[3743.48 → 3744.60] $96,000
[3744.60 → 3746.42] Speaking of
[3746.42 → 3747.40] Engineering samples
[3747.40 → 3749.46] We are officially
[3749.46 → 3750.36] Haswell'd up
[3750.36 → 3752.00] We can't put them
[3752.00 → 3752.58] On anything yet
[3752.58 → 3752.84] Yeah
[3752.84 → 3753.30] We don't have
[3753.30 → 3754.00] A motherboard yet
[3754.00 → 3755.56] Speaking of
[3755.56 → 3756.48] Not having the drivers
[3756.48 → 3757.30] To run the hardware
[3757.30 → 3758.56] We don't have
[3758.56 → 3759.22] The motherboard
[3759.22 → 3759.90] Yay look
[3759.90 → 3760.46] It's a chip
[3760.46 → 3761.04] And the top
[3761.04 → 3761.54] Is kind of
[3761.54 → 3762.30] Silvery coloured
[3762.30 → 3764.90] Ah
[3764.90 → 3765.62] Haswell
[3765.62 → 3766.82] Ah lower power
[3766.82 → 3767.46] Yeah
[3767.46 → 3768.32] You know how many times
[3768.32 → 3769.04] I've done this
[3769.04 → 3770.36] Where I've just been like
[3770.36 → 3771.42] Holding the new CPU
[3771.42 → 3772.54] Knowing that actually
[3772.54 → 3773.62] I can't do anything
[3773.62 → 3774.26] With it
[3774.26 → 3776.44] It's like every generation
[3776.44 → 3778.14] The chip always arrives first
[3778.14 → 3778.46] Um
[3778.46 → 3779.60] The Asus thing
[3779.60 → 3780.56] That I'm going to
[3780.56 → 3781.50] Should hopefully have
[3781.50 → 3782.18] Some details
[3782.18 → 3783.28] On their side
[3783.28 → 3784.38] But so far
[3784.38 → 3785.44] I haven't heard anything
[3785.44 → 3786.68] Solid from any motherboard guys
[3786.68 → 3787.94] I think MSI's got boards
[3787.94 → 3788.78] Lined up for us
[3788.78 → 3790.06] Uh Gigabyte said
[3790.06 → 3790.92] They're going to do their best
[3790.92 → 3792.14] To have boards lined up for us
[3792.14 → 3794.24] So we have all the Haswell's
[3794.24 → 3795.66] Actually that's one of the four
[3795.66 → 3797.04] That arrived in the mail for us
[3797.04 → 3797.72] People are saying
[3797.72 → 3798.74] Open it
[3798.74 → 3799.32] But
[3799.32 → 3800.40] Like
[3800.40 → 3802.02] These are so boring
[3802.02 → 3803.78] They're white to box you guys
[3803.78 → 3804.20] I mean what
[3804.20 → 3804.98] What do you want
[3804.98 → 3805.44] Here
[3805.44 → 3806.20] Hold this for a sec
[3806.20 → 3806.56] Sorry
[3806.56 → 3807.64] Um
[3807.64 → 3809.56] I got you Twitch chat
[3809.56 → 3810.64] Yeah
[3810.64 → 3811.22] Don't worry
[3811.22 → 3811.74] We're on this
[3811.74 → 3812.02] Okay
[3812.02 → 3812.92] Here we go
[3812.92 → 3813.62] Haswell
[3813.62 → 3815.54] This particular one
[3815.54 → 3817.02] Is a 4670K
[3817.02 → 3818.80] There you go
[3818.80 → 3821.62] Comes with
[3821.62 → 3822.72] Oh
[3822.72 → 3823.58] Oh my goodness
[3823.58 → 3824.26] A stock cooler
[3824.26 → 3824.66] Stunning
[3824.66 → 3826.72] A stock cooler
[3826.72 → 3828.04] That looks exactly like
[3828.04 → 3829.70] Thermal compound
[3829.70 → 3830.58] Amazing
[3830.58 → 3831.30] Pre-applied
[3831.30 → 3832.08] Revolutionary
[3832.08 → 3832.74] Cool your face
[3832.74 → 3833.38] You going to put it on your face
[3833.38 → 3833.86] Oh
[3833.86 → 3834.60] Lame
[3834.60 → 3835.52] I got it on my face
[3835.52 → 3836.00] No you didn't
[3836.00 → 3836.42] It's alright
[3836.42 → 3837.22] Is it okay
[3837.22 → 3837.84] It's alright
[3837.84 → 3838.60] Okay cool
[3838.60 → 3839.48] Um
[3839.48 → 3840.34] So there's that
[3840.34 → 3841.30] Yes
[3841.30 → 3842.82] Okay what's next
[3842.82 → 3843.60] It's revolutionary
[3843.60 → 3844.04] I know
[3844.04 → 3844.74] This changes everything
[3844.74 → 3846.06] This changes absolutely everything
[3846.06 → 3846.48] Again
[3846.48 → 3849.62] Changes the changes
[3849.62 → 3850.28] Again
[3850.28 → 3851.52] The changes are changing
[3851.52 → 3852.60] In a logarithmic
[3852.60 → 3854.04] Fashion
[3854.04 → 3855.28] The innovation is amazing
[3855.28 → 3856.02] Chip
[3856.02 → 3857.58] Beautiful
[3857.58 → 3858.36] Pads on the bottom
[3858.36 → 3858.86] Revolutionary
[3858.86 → 3860.16] I think this is all low time
[3860.16 → 3861.30] It doesn't change
[3861.30 → 3863.52] How many times have we seen this
[3863.52 → 3865.34] It's been done the spec for a while
[3865.34 → 3865.64] Oh
[3865.64 → 3866.28] Oh
[3866.28 → 3867.04] That's
[3867.04 → 3869.06] Probably a pretty solid indicator
[3869.06 → 3869.80] It's down
[3869.80 → 3873.04] Why
[3873.04 → 3875.78] Oh this is frustrating
[3875.78 → 3878.22] Last time it just revived itself
[3878.22 → 3879.04] So we can
[3879.04 → 3880.46] Maybe the
[3880.46 → 3882.10] The epic ness of Haswell
[3882.10 → 3883.98] People are saying Intel was like
[3883.98 → 3884.38] Nope
[3884.38 → 3884.94] Yeah
[3884.94 → 3885.70] The epic ness
[3885.70 → 3886.52] Apparently we're back
[3886.52 → 3888.12] So the epic ness of Haswell
[3888.12 → 3889.56] Just destroyed
[3889.56 → 3890.86] The live stream
[3890.86 → 3891.86] Because
[3891.86 → 3893.32] Some employee at Intel was like
[3893.32 → 3893.88] Smash
[3893.88 → 3895.90] Bring the hammer down
[3895.90 → 3896.54] There's like
[3896.54 → 3898.20] Control all the internet
[3898.20 → 3900.46] But yeah
[3900.46 → 3901.68] We've seen this time and time again
[3901.68 → 3903.32] It never actually changes
[3903.32 → 3904.78] We're talking a couple percent here and there
[3904.78 → 3907.60] This chip has been finished for months essentially
[3907.60 → 3908.88] Let me put it that way
[3908.88 → 3912.66] Like the kinds of tweaks that they're making in the months leading up to a launch
[3912.66 → 3914.98] Remember Intel sets a launch date
[3914.98 → 3916.36] Like an actual day
[3916.36 → 3918.54] Like months in advance
[3918.54 → 3921.80] How could they know that it's going to be ready that day
[3921.80 → 3928.36] Because Intel is not like some cheesy software company with two letters in their name
[3928.36 → 3930.28] That starts with E and ends in A
[3930.28 → 3931.40] Where they're just like
[3931.40 → 3932.22] Release date
[3932.22 → 3933.10] If it's not ready
[3933.10 → 3934.08] Release it anyway
[3934.08 → 3936.34] Intel does QA
[3936.34 → 3937.06] Like
[3937.06 → 3940.88] We're never going to get EA sponsorship ever
[3940.88 → 3943.88] We gave up on that a long time ago
[3943.88 → 3946.46] It's just over and done with at this point
[3946.46 → 3949.90] Maybe if they sent us a pizza with our next game
[3949.90 → 3953.78] But anyway
[3953.78 → 3955.24] I mean it's been done for months
[3955.24 → 3957.26] Which basically means that
[3957.26 → 3960.86] The chip that they're testing is pretty much done
[3960.86 → 3963.28] And it also means that whatever board
[3963.28 → 3966.10] Which has pretty much no logic left on it
[3966.10 → 3970.50] Now that the chip itself is integrating the PCI Express controller
[3970.50 → 3972.34] The memory controller
[3972.34 → 3973.82] The VRM
[3973.82 → 3975.34] The voltage regulation modules
[3975.34 → 3976.90] Which was part of our topic last week
[3976.90 → 3978.06] That we skimmed over a little bit
[3978.06 → 3979.32] That I'm going to launch into here
[3979.32 → 3983.50] There's not a lot that the motherboard actually contributes to the performance anymore
[3983.50 → 3986.48] Besides just providing a conduit
[3986.48 → 3990.08] For traces to go to like the memory slots
[3990.08 → 3993.32] So speaking of Haswell
[3993.32 → 3994.96] There was an AMA on Reddit
[3994.96 → 3996.20] A number of months back
[3996.20 → 3998.46] Where an Intel engineer said it would be an overclocked's delight
[3998.46 → 4001.80] And I think a lot of people assumed that that would mean that
[4001.80 → 4002.86] Unlike Ivy Bridge
[4002.86 → 4004.80] Because Sandy Bridge was a great overclocked
[4004.80 → 4009.06] Ivy Bridge had better performance per megahertz
[4009.06 → 4010.92] Than Sandy Bridge did
[4010.92 → 4012.06] But it didn't overclock as high
[4012.06 → 4014.04] So they ended up being for all intents and purposes
[4014.04 → 4015.46] For overclockers
[4015.46 → 4017.24] Equally performing platforms
[4017.24 → 4020.68] I think a lot of people assumed that that meant Haswell was going to overclock
[4020.68 → 4022.14] Like a bat out of hell again
[4022.14 → 4024.60] But what he might have actually meant
[4024.60 → 4026.36] Is that due to the integrated VRM
[4026.36 → 4029.82] You're going to be able to buy a cheapo motherboard
[4029.82 → 4033.64] And you're going to be able to get the same kind of overclocking performance
[4033.64 → 4035.64] As an expensive motherboard
[4035.64 → 4036.74] Which by the way
[4036.74 → 4039.20] Two motherboards running two chips
[4039.20 → 4040.50] At the same frequency
[4040.50 → 4042.28] I don't care what board it is
[4042.28 → 4045.04] Are going to be within margin of error of each other
[4045.04 → 4045.92] In terms of performance
[4045.92 → 4047.44] When it comes to overclocking
[4047.44 → 4049.38] Increasing the system performance
[4049.38 → 4051.16] It only does it
[4051.16 → 4053.14] If you can get more gigahertz
[4053.14 → 4055.10] A trend that we've been seeing lately
[4055.10 → 4057.04] That you actually picked out a while ago
[4057.04 → 4059.44] Is that people are building really, really high-end systems
[4059.44 → 4061.14] And they don't want to put a ton of cards in them
[4061.14 → 4062.20] Because they're just going
[4062.20 → 4062.76] Graphics card
[4062.76 → 4063.36] Oh it looks good
[4063.36 → 4064.04] I don't want to touch it
[4064.04 → 4064.84] I don't want to add more cards
[4064.84 → 4066.12] Leave it how it is
[4066.12 → 4066.54] Nope
[4066.54 → 4067.56] No I don't want to touch it
[4067.56 → 4069.98] Linus and I always put in sound cards
[4069.98 → 4071.22] And he's got a RAID card
[4071.22 → 4074.28] RAID card with eight SSDs on it
[4074.28 → 4074.92] And I'm just like
[4074.92 → 4076.80] Yes my cable management isn't perfect
[4076.80 → 4078.08] But you know what
[4078.08 → 4079.74] I actually have hardware in my machine
[4079.74 → 4082.26] Like we enjoy putting hardware in our machines
[4082.26 → 4083.12] So
[4083.12 → 4086.40] So
[4086.40 → 4087.82] Wow
[4087.82 → 4088.94] So
[4088.94 → 4089.82] Anyway
[4089.82 → 4091.18] I'm wondering
[4091.18 → 4091.80] I wonder
[4091.80 → 4093.08] I can't even talk now
[4093.08 → 4093.78] That was ridiculous
[4093.78 → 4094.90] I wonder with Haswell
[4094.90 → 4095.94] If we're going to see a lot more
[4095.94 → 4097.52] Card heavy machines
[4097.52 → 4098.64] Cheap motherboard
[4098.64 → 4100.02] Throw in a custom nick
[4100.02 → 4101.90] Throw in a custom sound card
[4101.90 → 4103.24] Buy a
[4103.24 → 4105.24] Buy a $119.99 board
[4105.24 → 4106.78] Buy a proper sound card
[4106.78 → 4107.56] Buy a proper
[4107.56 → 4108.42] I don't know
[4108.42 → 4108.78] Like what
[4108.78 → 4109.68] Like I mean
[4109.68 → 4111.32] SSDs are at the point now
[4111.32 → 4113.80] Where the onboard controllers
[4113.80 → 4116.28] Are not able to keep up with multiple SSDs
[4116.28 → 4119.18] So if people want to actually get the most performance possible
[4119.18 → 4120.46] Out of their storage system
[4120.46 → 4122.82] They may need a third party RAID controller
[4122.82 → 4124.32] Speaking of which
[4124.32 → 4125.58] For the longest time
[4125.58 → 4127.10] People would ask me
[4127.10 → 4129.58] Is there any benefit to RAID zeroing SSDs
[4129.58 → 4132.80] And having run everything from a hard drive
[4132.80 → 4134.54] To a cached solution
[4134.54 → 4135.92] To an SSD
[4135.92 → 4137.38] To a better SSD
[4137.38 → 4138.46] To a better SSD
[4138.46 → 4140.40] To an 8 SSD array
[4140.40 → 4141.86] In my personal machine
[4141.86 → 4142.78] Over the years
[4142.78 → 4144.42] I would always tell them
[4144.42 → 4144.92] Actually no
[4144.92 → 4146.18] It really doesn't make any difference
[4146.18 → 4147.80] I was wrong
[4147.80 → 4148.46] Because
[4148.46 → 4148.98] I mean
[4148.98 → 4149.28] Okay
[4149.28 → 4149.60] Yes
[4149.60 → 4150.66] It makes a difference in benchmarks
[4150.66 → 4151.58] That much is clear
[4151.58 → 4152.96] But I've had people ask me
[4152.96 → 4153.40] Day to day
[4153.40 → 4154.32] Do you notice a difference
[4154.32 → 4156.70] And I didn't notice
[4156.70 → 4157.58] When I upgraded
[4157.58 → 4159.68] To my 8 SSD RAID zero array
[4159.68 → 4161.60] And it didn't bother me that much
[4161.60 → 4163.72] When my personal rig was down
[4163.72 → 4164.58] For a long time
[4164.58 → 4165.70] And I wasn't using it
[4165.70 → 4167.18] But now that I'm back on it
[4167.18 → 4167.62] I'm like
[4167.62 → 4168.26] Oh
[4168.26 → 4169.18] Yeah
[4169.18 → 4170.24] It actually makes a difference
[4170.24 → 4171.36] I watched some
[4171.36 → 4172.90] Some program openings
[4172.90 → 4174.42] That were kind of ridiculous
[4174.42 → 4175.04] Like
[4175.04 → 4176.96] He runs a fairly decent SSD
[4176.96 → 4178.38] You've got an Octane 256
[4178.38 → 4178.82] Right
[4178.82 → 4180.92] Which is not the best SSD in the world
[4180.92 → 4181.52] But it's good
[4181.52 → 4182.74] It's a SATA 3 SSD
[4182.74 → 4183.96] It's not a bad drive
[4183.96 → 4186.02] But it's just like
[4186.02 → 4186.86] It's
[4186.86 → 4188.06] It's the responsiveness
[4188.06 → 4189.44] I didn't realize
[4189.44 → 4190.16] What was missing
[4190.16 → 4191.40] Until it was taken away
[4191.40 → 4192.52] And then I was giving it back
[4192.52 → 4192.92] And I'm like
[4192.92 → 4193.20] Oh
[4193.20 → 4193.52] Okay
[4193.52 → 4193.78] Right
[4193.78 → 4194.12] This
[4194.12 → 4195.44] This is good
[4195.44 → 4196.06] Speaking of which
[4196.06 → 4196.76] My personal rig
[4196.76 → 4198.38] Is 100% up and running now
[4198.38 → 4199.82] The only thing I'm missing
[4199.82 → 4200.66] Is cosmetic
[4200.66 → 4202.68] I'm missing the glass panel
[4202.68 → 4203.62] For the side window
[4203.62 → 4205.40] And then I'm also missing
[4205.40 → 4207.04] Little grommets
[4207.04 → 4208.38] To cover things with
[4208.38 → 4209.14] What are you pointing at?
[4209.16 → 4210.20] Technically you can't turn on right now
[4210.20 → 4211.42] That's not my personal rig
[4211.42 → 4212.48] The RAM is
[4212.48 → 4213.38] Oh
[4213.38 → 4213.88] No, no
[4213.88 → 4215.12] I put G-Skill RAM in it
[4215.12 → 4215.62] Oh
[4215.62 → 4216.50] Yeah
[4216.50 → 4218.54] And when you finally bring the server back
[4218.54 → 4219.42] From NCI
[4219.42 → 4221.00] I will be able to deck it out
[4221.00 → 4222.46] That's doing good things right now
[4222.46 → 4222.74] Yeah
[4222.74 → 4223.14] I know
[4223.14 → 4223.50] Okay
[4223.50 → 4224.40] I just need that RAM
[4224.40 → 4224.84] Yeah
[4224.84 → 4225.36] For my rig
[4225.36 → 4227.72] All 64 gigs of it
[4227.72 → 4228.94] There's 48 in there
[4228.94 → 4230.22] Yeah, but I have 16
[4230.22 → 4230.60] Okay
[4230.60 → 4231.90] In my rig right now
[4231.90 → 4232.48] So yeah
[4232.48 → 4232.72] Bam
[4232.72 → 4233.64] I was like what?
[4234.32 → 4234.72] Bam
[4234.72 → 4236.14] Um
[4236.14 → 4238.42] What were we talking about?
[4238.42 → 4238.76] Oh yeah
[4238.76 → 4240.22] We wanted to do the rest of the news items
[4240.22 → 4242.30] So here's our next rumour
[4242.30 → 4244.50] So this one looks pretty interesting
[4244.50 → 4245.22] We're gonna
[4245.22 → 4246.52] Hopefully
[4246.52 → 4247.32] We actually
[4247.32 → 4248.32] What's going on?
[4248.34 → 4248.88] Oh there it is
[4248.88 → 4250.02] Oh that's funky
[4250.02 → 4251.98] We actually know nothing about this
[4251.98 → 4252.16] Yeah
[4252.16 → 4253.26] But Goodbyes
[4253.26 → 4254.98] Contributed this news topic
[4254.98 → 4255.92] Wow 800 posts
[4255.92 → 4257.60] Goodbyes contributes a lot to the news section
[4257.60 → 4258.40] Thank you Goodbyes
[4258.40 → 4259.34] Thank you Goodbyes
[4259.34 → 4260.06] You are the man
[4260.06 → 4261.30] Or lady
[4261.30 → 4262.76] Person
[4262.76 → 4264.02] Guy
[4264.02 → 4264.84] Dude
[4264.84 → 4266.52] Dude is kind of both
[4266.52 → 4267.76] Dude
[4267.76 → 4268.56] No one says Odette
[4268.56 → 4269.18] Yeah
[4269.18 → 4270.30] That's weird
[4270.30 → 4271.68] People also say guys
[4271.68 → 4272.18] Yeah
[4272.18 → 4272.66] Hey guys
[4272.66 → 4274.14] In reference to entire groups of people
[4274.14 → 4277.46] So Goodbyes is one of good guys
[4277.46 → 4278.66] One of several good guys
[4278.66 → 4280.34] Regardless of gender
[4280.34 → 4281.82] And I mean
[4281.82 → 4282.32] You know what?
[4282.64 → 4282.84] Hey
[4282.84 → 4283.98] Gender's not so much
[4283.98 → 4286.00] Just like an on-off switch anymore
[4286.00 → 4286.60] There's that
[4286.60 → 4288.64] Sort of that whole gender spectrum discussion
[4288.64 → 4289.04] So
[4289.04 → 4290.04] Goodbyes
[4290.04 → 4291.46] Good individual
[4291.46 → 4292.38] Good human being
[4292.38 → 4293.42] Or even multiple people
[4293.42 → 4293.88] I mean
[4293.88 → 4295.24] Schizophrenia is a thing
[4295.24 → 4295.86] Good
[4295.86 → 4296.96] Good
[4296.96 → 4298.58] Organism
[4298.58 → 4300.64] You are a great organism
[4300.64 → 4301.08] Okay
[4301.08 → 4302.64] Let's settle on that from now on
[4302.64 → 4302.94] Okay
[4302.94 → 4304.38] Is that even technically right?
[4305.24 → 4305.94] I think so
[4305.94 → 4307.66] Because he could be multiple organisms
[4307.66 → 4309.02] If he has a parasite inside him
[4309.02 → 4309.34] Yeah
[4309.34 → 4319.34] Anyway
[4319.34 → 4321.00] What is politically correct
[4321.00 → 4321.40] Going to come to?
[4321.40 → 4321.50] I don't know here
[4321.50 → 4322.14] Talk about this
[4322.14 → 4322.56] Anyway
[4322.56 → 4325.84] So NVIDIA is releasing some new GPUs
[4325.84 → 4326.32] Allegedly
[4326.32 → 4326.94] Allegedly
[4326.94 → 4328.56] We actually have no idea
[4328.56 → 4329.84] The first I heard of this
[4329.84 → 4331.34] Was actually Goodbyes post
[4331.34 → 4332.20] So
[4332.20 → 4333.56] So
[4333.56 → 4335.38] According to the post
[4335.38 → 4337.16] It won't be Maxwell Next Generation
[4337.16 → 4339.32] But rather a refresh of the Kepler series
[4339.32 → 4340.74] Which makes sense
[4340.74 → 4342.64] Because like everyone else
[4342.64 → 4346.52] NVIDIA seems to follow that Intel TikTok strategy
[4346.52 → 4347.72] Where it's
[4347.72 → 4350.30] Process shrink
[4350.30 → 4351.70] Architecture change
[4351.70 → 4352.62] Process shrink
[4352.62 → 4353.72] Architecture change
[4353.72 → 4355.50] So we've got Kepler now
[4355.50 → 4357.04] Maybe a process shrink
[4357.04 → 4358.94] Reduction of heat and power consumption
[4358.94 → 4360.40] Maybe some more overclocking headroom
[4360.40 → 4361.10] Some bug fixes
[4361.10 → 4362.32] Some performance improvements
[4362.32 → 4364.18] Which all makes sense for process shrink
[4364.18 → 4364.94] All in all
[4364.94 → 4367.14] I'd expect a GTX 780 to be
[4367.14 → 4369.04] 10 to 15% better than a 680
[4369.04 → 4370.06] Just guessing
[4370.06 → 4372.04] But maybe 20% better
[4372.04 → 4373.60] Maybe it overclocks a little better
[4373.60 → 4374.90] Maybe it's lower power consumption
[4374.90 → 4376.38] All this makes sense
[4376.38 → 4377.68] However
[4377.68 → 4379.22] Go ahead
[4379.22 → 4380.68] The main thing I'm hoping for
[4380.68 → 4381.86] Is no plastic extensions
[4381.86 → 4382.52] Yeah
[4382.52 → 4383.90] I want full PCBs
[4383.90 → 4385.10] No ego extensions on them
[4385.10 → 4386.36] You know what's funny is
[4386.36 → 4388.44] Have you seen a reference 7790?
[4389.14 → 4390.84] Because we didn't have a reference one
[4390.84 → 4391.84] When you were doing your testing
[4391.84 → 4393.12] I have not actually
[4393.12 → 4394.32] It has a long PCB
[4394.32 → 4395.32] But like
[4395.32 → 4396.98] Two inches of it are just blank
[4396.98 → 4399.88] Honestly I'd still rather that
[4399.88 → 4401.68] I'd rather a PCB
[4401.68 → 4402.56] Than
[4402.56 → 4404.14] A plastic extension
[4404.14 → 4405.54] But it's still like
[4405.54 → 4405.78] Extension
[4405.78 → 4406.26] Oh
[4406.26 → 4408.02] So what I'm hoping
[4408.02 → 4409.32] If this does turn out to be
[4409.32 → 4410.14] NVIDIA's strategy
[4410.14 → 4411.52] Is that
[4411.52 → 4412.64] Someone
[4412.64 → 4414.70] Launches a completely new architecture
[4414.70 → 4416.20] Because AMD
[4416.20 → 4417.86] As far as I know
[4417.86 → 4419.14] Has been talking about
[4419.14 → 4420.42] The end of this year
[4420.42 → 4422.04] Something going on
[4422.04 → 4422.98] That's another rumour
[4422.98 → 4423.52] Allegedly
[4423.52 → 4424.72] We don't actually know for sure
[4424.72 → 4425.46] Honestly no idea
[4425.46 → 4426.78] But if they launched
[4426.78 → 4428.10] A completely new architecture
[4428.10 → 4429.18] That could put
[4429.18 → 4431.12] NVIDIA at a bit of an advantage
[4431.12 → 4432.24] For the next few months
[4432.24 → 4434.22] But then at a bit of a disadvantage
[4434.22 → 4436.64] In the months following that
[4436.64 → 4437.74] I mean especially if AMD
[4437.74 → 4439.42] Can launch something in time for
[4439.42 → 4441.54] Here's an article on it
[4441.54 → 4442.76] On PC Per by the way
[4442.76 → 4444.12] There's the Godzilla link
[4444.12 → 4445.62] So we can go check that out
[4445.62 → 4446.88] I mean Godzilla
[4446.88 → 4448.02] Take it all with a grain of salt
[4448.02 → 4448.60] It's Godzilla
[4448.60 → 4449.10] Yeah
[4449.10 → 4450.46] I actually met Fund
[4450.46 → 4452.10] For the first time at CES 2013
[4452.10 → 4452.58] Really?
[4452.76 → 4453.00] Yeah
[4453.00 → 4453.92] I ran into him
[4453.92 → 4455.24] He's super soft-spoken
[4455.24 → 4456.00] I was surprised
[4456.00 → 4457.76] Yeah I was
[4457.76 → 4459.22] I was hanging out with Josh
[4459.22 → 4459.74] From Fractal
[4459.74 → 4460.32] Oh cool
[4460.32 → 4462.30] And Judo knows him
[4462.30 → 4463.52] Apparently they go way back
[4463.52 → 4464.52] So they were talking
[4464.52 → 4465.10] That makes sense
[4465.10 → 4466.72] Judo had no idea
[4466.72 → 4467.60] Who I was of course
[4467.60 → 4468.70] So I was like
[4468.70 → 4469.46] Okay that's okay
[4469.46 → 4471.14] It's like one of those things
[4471.14 → 4471.94] It's like I get pulled over
[4471.94 → 4472.20] By the car
[4472.20 → 4473.40] Do you even know who I am?
[4473.44 → 4474.42] I'm Linus Tech Tips
[4474.42 → 4475.22] From YouTube
[4475.22 → 4477.42] You can't give me a ticket
[4477.42 → 4478.98] I make videos on YouTube
[4478.98 → 4479.80] Yeah exactly
[4479.80 → 4481.24] Like don't you know
[4481.24 → 4482.54] What internet famous means?
[4483.00 → 4484.42] I walked through a forest once
[4484.42 → 4486.02] And chugged hot sauce
[4486.02 → 4487.40] Oh that was painful
[4487.40 → 4488.98] That was
[4488.98 → 4489.40] By the way
[4489.40 → 4490.74] The red bottle was hot sauce
[4490.74 → 4491.62] And he actually did
[4491.62 → 4492.58] It was like
[4492.58 → 4493.04] You know
[4493.04 → 4493.70] It would have been smart
[4493.70 → 4495.98] To put something else inside it
[4495.98 → 4497.74] Did not think of that
[4497.74 → 4501.14] Like legit
[4501.14 → 4502.32] Did not think of that
[4502.32 → 4504.80] So we've got two more
[4504.80 → 4506.08] Very important items
[4506.08 → 4506.62] Coming up
[4506.62 → 4507.22] These are going to be
[4507.22 → 4508.54] Our featured build logs
[4508.54 → 4509.00] Of the week
[4509.00 → 4509.54] So Slick
[4509.54 → 4510.18] Take it away
[4510.18 → 4511.32] Desert Storm
[4511.32 → 4511.98] So Desert Storm
[4511.98 → 4512.60] Is the first one
[4512.60 → 4513.42] We are not logged in
[4513.42 → 4514.34] So why don't you talk about
[4514.34 → 4514.86] Desert Storm
[4514.86 → 4515.68] While I log us in
[4515.68 → 4516.34] Desert Storm
[4516.34 → 4517.28] Is an awesome tribute
[4517.28 → 4519.02] To just picking the right
[4519.02 → 4520.06] Colour scheme parts
[4520.06 → 4521.68] And like
[4521.68 → 4523.32] Envisioning your build
[4523.32 → 4524.10] Before you do it
[4524.10 → 4525.34] And then sleeve your
[4525.34 → 4526.32] Power supply properly
[4526.32 → 4527.58] And just having something
[4527.58 → 4528.34] That looks
[4528.34 → 4529.38] So much more
[4529.38 → 4530.38] Than some of its parts
[4530.38 → 4531.26] Without putting
[4531.26 → 4533.70] Like way too much
[4533.70 → 4534.20] Into it
[4534.20 → 4535.20] So this is a
[4535.20 → 4536.70] Like great looking computer
[4536.70 → 4537.96] Looks absolutely awesome
[4537.96 → 4538.70] Hopefully Linus
[4538.70 → 4539.84] Can actually log in
[4539.84 → 4540.74] So I can stop
[4540.74 → 4542.36] Stalling
[4542.36 → 4543.48] Stalling for time
[4543.48 → 4544.34] As I talk about
[4544.34 → 4545.36] How the computer looks good
[4545.36 → 4546.16] There we go
[4546.16 → 4547.92] So he picked like a
[4547.92 → 4548.98] Desert Stormy
[4548.98 → 4549.82] Kind of colour scheme
[4549.82 → 4550.18] You know what
[4550.18 → 4550.88] I'm going to zoom out
[4550.88 → 4551.38] A little bit
[4551.38 → 4554.20] That actually looks
[4554.20 → 4554.84] Better zoomed out
[4554.84 → 4555.42] There we go
[4555.42 → 4557.18] So everything kind of suits
[4557.18 → 4558.80] It all looks good
[4558.80 → 4559.62] You can tell it was
[4559.62 → 4560.56] Planned out beforehand
[4560.56 → 4562.94] Nice tough
[4562.94 → 4563.86] Tough series board
[4563.86 → 4564.40] Selection
[4564.40 → 4565.12] Tough series board
[4565.12 → 4565.66] The right colour
[4565.66 → 4565.98] Vengeance
[4565.98 → 4566.94] Corsair Vengeance
[4566.94 → 4567.78] Memory looks good
[4567.78 → 4568.64] That's great looking
[4568.64 → 4569.64] Sleeving that he's got
[4569.64 → 4570.00] On there
[4570.00 → 4570.60] Or she
[4570.60 → 4571.52] MD PC
[4571.52 → 4572.22] Yep
[4572.22 → 4574.28] I wouldn't mind
[4574.28 → 4575.08] Seeing things a little
[4575.08 → 4576.12] Bit tidier in here
[4576.12 → 4576.62] But honestly
[4576.62 → 4577.68] Mine's not much better
[4577.68 → 4578.32] So I can't
[4578.32 → 4579.46] And it's still pretty good
[4579.46 → 4580.68] Can't criticize too much
[4580.68 → 4581.80] I noticed that too actually
[4581.80 → 4582.36] But it's still
[4582.36 → 4583.20] It's not bad
[4583.20 → 4584.36] It's not bad at all
[4584.36 → 4585.48] At least it's sleeved
[4585.48 → 4586.48] But you can
[4586.48 → 4587.50] You can get your groupings
[4587.50 → 4588.76] A little bit tighter than that
[4588.76 → 4590.28] Great job on the sleeving
[4590.28 → 4591.34] Look how even that is
[4591.34 → 4592.54] Yeah it's
[4592.54 → 4593.52] It's not quite as good
[4593.52 → 4594.08] On the power supply
[4594.08 → 4595.44] But people won't see that really
[4595.44 → 4596.50] Yeah mine's ghetto
[4596.50 → 4597.36] On the power supply
[4597.36 → 4598.24] Just because it doesn't
[4598.24 → 4598.70] Really matter
[4598.70 → 4599.16] Yeah
[4599.16 → 4602.36] Yeah so you can see
[4602.36 → 4603.60] It's a little bit more choppy there
[4603.60 → 4605.36] But as we both said earlier
[4605.36 → 4605.74] It doesn't matter
[4605.74 → 4607.16] He's got some really nice photos
[4607.16 → 4608.00] I really like that one
[4608.00 → 4608.46] This one
[4608.46 → 4608.98] This one
[4608.98 → 4609.74] Very
[4609.74 → 4610.96] Cooler Master V8
[4610.96 → 4612.12] This looks really cool
[4612.12 → 4613.14] Cooler Master V8
[4613.14 → 4614.20] I don't think gets enough credit
[4614.20 → 4615.00] No
[4615.00 → 4616.28] It's very cool looking
[4616.28 → 4617.02] It performs alright
[4617.02 → 4618.24] It's not a bad heat sink
[4618.24 → 4620.14] It really suits this build as well
[4620.14 → 4621.06] Because it's kind of
[4621.06 → 4621.76] There we go
[4621.76 → 4622.60] There's the money shot
[4622.60 → 4623.12] Yeah
[4623.12 → 4625.76] So he must have planned it out
[4625.76 → 4627.12] He must have envisioned it beforehand
[4627.12 → 4628.60] He picked the right parts
[4628.60 → 4629.64] He sleeved his power supply
[4629.64 → 4630.58] And it just looks perfect
[4630.58 → 4632.02] Yeah this is the kind of build
[4632.02 → 4634.00] That is very doable
[4634.00 → 4635.24] For you know
[4635.24 → 4636.70] Someone building a new rig
[4636.70 → 4638.08] That I mean obviously
[4638.08 → 4639.16] You need a bit of a budget
[4639.16 → 4640.44] To make a machine like that
[4640.44 → 4640.58] Oh for sure
[4640.58 → 4642.22] But it's not one of those crazy
[4642.22 → 4643.76] Like you have to own your own
[4643.76 → 4644.80] Like water cutter
[4644.80 → 4645.92] To make it
[4645.92 → 4647.12] You like sold your house
[4647.12 → 4648.38] And bought a few machines
[4648.38 → 4649.06] And some tools
[4649.06 → 4649.78] And some parts
[4649.78 → 4650.78] And built a computer
[4650.78 → 4651.74] So
[4651.74 → 4653.18] It's
[4653.18 → 4654.56] Which we're not saying is a problem
[4654.56 → 4655.44] No not at all
[4655.44 → 4655.90] Of course
[4655.90 → 4656.56] That's
[4656.56 → 4657.02] Yeah
[4657.02 → 4657.92] That's why I don't have anything
[4657.92 → 4658.44] Not at all
[4658.44 → 4660.38] Except my computer's not that great
[4660.38 → 4662.30] This one is just
[4662.30 → 4663.52] Nuts
[4663.52 → 4665.12] The psychedelic machine it's called
[4665.12 → 4666.06] It's nuts
[4666.06 → 4667.42] I'm going to let it
[4667.42 → 4668.36] Kind of speak for itself
[4668.36 → 4669.78] Once we get down here a little bit
[4669.78 → 4671.70] So he's picking some parts
[4671.70 → 4673.26] XSPC displays
[4673.26 → 4673.64] Okay
[4673.64 → 4674.18] Yeah
[4674.18 → 4675.80] So he's just installing lighting there
[4675.80 → 4677.44] And this is car lighting
[4677.44 → 4679.16] That he just adapted into Mole plugs
[4679.16 → 4679.64] Okay
[4679.64 → 4680.52] That's doable
[4680.52 → 4681.78] It's just 12 volts lighting
[4681.78 → 4681.96] Yeah
[4681.96 → 4682.24] I know
[4682.24 → 4684.04] So you're starting to see the kind of
[4684.04 → 4686.10] Crazy colour scheme coming in
[4686.10 → 4686.40] Okay
[4686.40 → 4688.04] So we got red on the rad
[4688.04 → 4690.24] Green on this bit of tubing right here
[4690.24 → 4691.90] Lord only knows what kind of coolant
[4691.90 → 4692.80] He's going to put in here
[4692.80 → 4693.28] Or she
[4693.28 → 4695.20] All the fingerprints on the power supply
[4695.20 → 4695.48] Yeah
[4695.48 → 4696.62] Almost done
[4696.62 → 4697.20] Ooh
[4697.20 → 4698.04] It
[4698.04 → 4699.24] He paints it black
[4699.24 → 4700.84] Wood panelling
[4700.84 → 4701.26] Wow
[4701.26 → 4702.14] He's like
[4702.14 → 4703.22] He brought it into it
[4703.22 → 4704.78] It's kind of easy to work with
[4704.78 → 4704.98] I'm like
[4704.98 → 4705.86] It looks sharp
[4705.86 → 4706.84] Okay
[4706.84 → 4707.32] Okay
[4707.32 → 4708.66] And the panel's not on yet
[4708.66 → 4710.18] Red mod on the pump
[4710.18 → 4712.14] Red and black sleeving
[4712.14 → 4713.52] More green tubing
[4713.52 → 4714.22] All right
[4714.22 → 4715.16] It's nuts
[4715.16 → 4716.02] Is that the
[4716.02 → 4717.40] The aqua
[4717.40 → 4718.88] Or alpha cool
[4718.88 → 4719.74] It looks like it
[4719.74 → 4720.40] Because it's got the
[4720.40 → 4721.64] I see the filament in the middle
[4721.64 → 4722.26] Okay
[4722.26 → 4722.88] It's not a filament
[4722.88 → 4723.34] But whatever
[4723.34 → 4723.94] Wow
[4723.94 → 4726.12] It's crazy
[4726.12 → 4728.64] Look at that coolant
[4728.64 → 4731.10] The reason why this mainly got in here
[4731.10 → 4732.90] Is his awesome custom wood panels
[4732.90 → 4733.52] Right
[4733.52 → 4736.04] And the fact that it's just absolutely nuts
[4736.04 → 4737.28] Absolutely like
[4737.28 → 4738.86] Pants on head
[4738.86 → 4739.76] Ludicrous
[4739.76 → 4740.42] Look at this
[4740.42 → 4742.46] He's intentionally left extra space
[4742.46 → 4743.54] At the top of the res
[4743.54 → 4744.64] So you can see it pour in
[4744.64 → 4746.00] So the water can pour in
[4746.00 → 4748.08] Which makes it louder and more obnoxious
[4748.08 → 4751.48] But I don't think louder and more obnoxious is a problem
[4751.48 → 4752.70] He's probably going for that
[4752.70 → 4755.02] He's probably going for loud and obnoxious here
[4755.02 → 4756.34] It's awesome
[4756.34 → 4757.74] It's such like a cool build
[4757.74 → 4759.04] You don't see stuff like this that awesome
[4759.04 → 4761.12] The phobia UV LEDs are better
[4761.12 → 4762.98] They have much higher density
[4762.98 → 4764.14] So if you're out there
[4764.14 → 4766.00] Oh we didn't even say who this
[4766.00 → 4767.42] Who contributed this build
[4767.42 → 4767.82] Oh
[4767.82 → 4769.84] Slayer 677
[4769.84 → 4771.40] Not quite 666
[4771.40 → 4772.44] Not quite
[4772.44 → 4773.42] Not actually
[4773.42 → 4774.24] Better than that
[4774.24 → 4775.86] He's just a slayer
[4775.86 → 4776.78] One more than that
[4776.78 → 4778.96] But yeah
[4778.96 → 4780.08] If you want to swap those out
[4780.08 → 4781.30] For the phobia ones
[4781.30 → 4782.16] They're quite excellent
[4782.16 → 4784.22] I actually encountered tubing
[4784.22 → 4785.58] That glows like this
[4785.58 → 4787.26] Or a coolant that glows this strongly
[4787.26 → 4787.96] Once
[4787.96 → 4789.36] And it was
[4789.36 → 4791.26] It was some weird brand
[4791.26 → 4792.30] I can't even remember
[4792.30 → 4794.02] From like Germany or something
[4794.02 → 4795.56] I still have a bottle of it upstairs
[4795.56 → 4798.98] It glows like nothing I've ever seen before
[4798.98 → 4801.20] Been saving it for
[4801.20 → 4802.40] Sort of rainy day
[4802.40 → 4804.54] So that's just
[4804.54 → 4805.98] Absolutely wacky tobacco
[4805.98 → 4807.02] I don't even
[4807.02 → 4808.10] Like
[4808.10 → 4808.96] It's nuts
[4808.96 → 4809.54] There's no more
[4809.54 → 4810.86] But it's just
[4810.86 → 4812.86] I feel this crazy
[4812.86 → 4814.18] Love it
[4814.18 → 4816.58] So love to see these kinds of awesome builds
[4816.58 → 4816.88] Guys
[4816.88 → 4818.92] Don't forget to post in the build log section
[4818.92 → 4820.10] Of Linus Tech Tips Forum
[4820.10 → 4822.64] For a chance to be featured on the live stream
[4822.64 → 4824.38] Which gives you the
[4824.38 → 4828.02] Self satisfaction
[4828.02 → 4829.76] Once the new forum's up
[4829.76 → 4830.66] We are going to be looking at
[4830.66 → 4831.46] I haven't
[4831.46 → 4833.32] You don't even know how much I've talked to you about this
[4833.32 → 4833.72] But
[4833.72 → 4834.86] Once the new forum's up
[4834.86 → 4835.58] I'm doing this
[4835.58 → 4835.98] So
[4835.98 → 4837.08] Whatever man
[4837.08 → 4838.76] Yeah
[4838.76 → 4840.12] Once the new forum's up
[4840.12 → 4841.12] I'm going to look into
[4841.12 → 4842.68] Custom badges and stuff
[4842.68 → 4844.74] So you can have them on your profile
[4844.74 → 4845.58] Whenever you post
[4845.58 → 4846.52] It'll show on the side
[4846.52 → 4846.82] And stuff
[4846.82 → 4847.78] So you have a little emblem
[4847.78 → 4848.34] Or a badge
[4848.34 → 4848.88] Or something
[4848.88 → 4850.42] And we'll have
[4850.42 → 4851.46] Like news contributors
[4851.46 → 4852.40] News contributors
[4852.40 → 4853.84] Build log guys
[4853.84 → 4854.42] Just like
[4854.42 → 4855.08] Different awards
[4855.08 → 4855.70] That you can get
[4855.70 → 4857.54] So there will actually be something to show
[4857.54 → 4858.70] For now
[4858.70 → 4860.74] You get a bro fist
[4860.74 → 4861.78] You get a bro fist
[4861.78 → 4862.90] And Win speed
[4862.90 → 4863.78] Has a sticky
[4863.78 → 4864.94] At the top of the build log section
[4864.94 → 4865.92] With everyone who's been featured
[4865.92 → 4866.34] Oh
[4866.34 → 4866.98] Okay cool
[4866.98 → 4867.68] And that post
[4867.68 → 4868.88] Gets fairly frequented
[4868.88 → 4870.02] So that's pretty cool
[4870.02 → 4870.38] Yeah
[4870.38 → 4871.66] It's a great way to show off
[4871.66 → 4872.40] The hardware
[4872.40 → 4873.28] I mean it's one thing
[4873.28 → 4874.46] To work really hard on someone
[4874.46 → 4875.60] And then like
[4875.60 → 4876.18] Your sister
[4876.18 → 4877.12] And your like
[4877.12 → 4878.06] Your friends are like
[4878.06 → 4880.44] Okay
[4880.44 → 4882.04] Really?
[4882.20 → 4883.20] That's your computer?
[4883.56 → 4884.36] It looks like
[4884.36 → 4886.10] Disco
[4886.10 → 4887.90] And you're just like
[4887.90 → 4889.38] Oh you don't appreciate this
[4889.38 → 4889.72] And they're like
[4889.72 → 4890.76] Yeah no we don't
[4890.76 → 4892.32] So it's great to have
[4892.32 → 4893.06] Someone who actually
[4893.06 → 4894.26] Appreciates what you've done
[4894.26 → 4895.14] Look at it
[4895.14 → 4897.86] Speaking from experience
[4897.86 → 4899.34] It is
[4899.34 → 4900.58] That's brutal
[4900.58 → 4901.64] Okay why don't we
[4901.64 → 4902.82] I think our last
[4902.82 → 4904.32] News item of the week
[4904.32 → 4905.32] Is a bit of an
[4905.32 → 4906.98] Ongoing thing right now
[4906.98 → 4907.50] If you go to
[4907.50 → 4909.14] Diabloned.com
[4909.14 → 4910.60] We're going to link
[4910.60 → 4911.30] Right here to
[4911.30 → 4912.42] The Euro gamer article
[4912.42 → 4914.10] About a gamer
[4914.10 → 4915.00] Who's been banned
[4915.00 → 4916.76] From twitch.tv
[4916.76 → 4918.64] So Slick
[4918.64 → 4919.50] You wanna cover this one?
[4919.56 → 4919.98] Do you even have
[4919.98 → 4920.66] The live stream notes
[4920.66 → 4921.58] On your computer there?
[4921.64 → 4922.66] I'm trying to deal
[4922.66 → 4923.46] With something else
[4923.46 → 4924.32] That's going on right now
[4924.32 → 4925.26] So no I do not
[4925.26 → 4926.04] Okay I'll cover it
[4926.04 → 4927.90] Okay so basically
[4927.90 → 4930.20] This gamer who's
[4930.20 → 4931.82] A Diablo 3 gamer
[4931.82 → 4932.80] Who's gone by the name
[4932.80 → 4934.22] Of Zillion OP
[4934.22 → 4936.84] Was pretending
[4936.84 → 4938.42] To be paralyzed
[4938.42 → 4940.28] From the waist down
[4940.28 → 4940.94] He was pretending
[4940.94 → 4941.58] That he was stuck
[4941.58 → 4942.12] In a wheelchair
[4942.12 → 4943.18] And couldn't walk
[4943.18 → 4944.68] In order to
[4944.68 → 4945.50] In addition to
[4945.50 → 4946.34] His game streaming
[4946.34 → 4947.04] Which presumably
[4947.04 → 4948.10] His streams were decent
[4948.10 → 4948.88] Otherwise I doubt
[4948.88 → 4950.08] Anyone would have
[4950.08 → 4951.66] Really cared that much
[4951.66 → 4952.60] It was often him
[4952.60 → 4953.36] And his girlfriend
[4953.36 → 4954.46] And sometimes other people
[4954.46 → 4955.12] So it was kind of
[4955.12 → 4955.84] A group of them
[4955.84 → 4956.18] Yeah
[4956.18 → 4956.90] That would all go together
[4956.90 → 4958.44] So they'd all go together
[4958.44 → 4959.08] They were streaming
[4959.08 → 4960.20] Presumably it was alright
[4960.20 → 4963.36] He asked for money
[4963.36 → 4964.46] To get a wheelchair
[4964.46 → 4966.16] Asked for money
[4966.16 → 4967.36] To travel
[4967.36 → 4967.88] To move in
[4967.88 → 4968.50] With his girlfriend
[4968.50 → 4969.78] Asked for
[4969.78 → 4970.78] Just generally money
[4970.78 → 4971.80] There's been an estimated
[4971.80 → 4973.90] $20,000 donated
[4973.90 → 4976.40] Over the time
[4976.40 → 4977.18] That he's been running
[4977.18 → 4979.00] This little scam
[4979.00 → 4980.22] Just sort of asking
[4980.22 → 4981.32] People for money
[4981.32 → 4982.30] Because of
[4982.30 → 4983.48] Sob story
[4983.48 → 4984.16] Boo hoo
[4984.16 → 4984.74] I'm a wheelchair
[4984.74 → 4985.18] Bound gamer
[4985.18 → 4986.80] I mean I suspect
[4986.80 → 4987.94] There's a lot of people
[4987.94 → 4988.52] Who game
[4988.52 → 4989.64] Who are in wheelchairs
[4989.64 → 4991.90] The problem is
[4991.90 → 4992.82] There's people that are
[4992.82 → 4994.46] Legitimately disabled
[4994.46 → 4994.98] Yes
[4994.98 → 4995.84] That are trying
[4995.84 → 4997.16] Very hard to make it
[4997.16 → 4998.78] And are trying to stream
[4998.78 → 4999.90] And they enjoy it
[4999.90 → 5000.68] And there are communities
[5000.68 → 5001.26] Built around it
[5001.26 → 5002.10] I can't remember the name of it
[5002.10 → 5003.06] And then there's this butthole
[5003.06 → 5003.86] Who's this
[5003.86 → 5004.32] Just
[5004.32 → 5005.02] Pretending
[5005.02 → 5007.26] Like look no hands
[5007.26 → 5008.28] That guy's amazing
[5008.28 → 5009.58] There's a guy that's blind
[5009.58 → 5010.30] Who does
[5010.30 → 5011.32] Lets plays
[5011.32 → 5012.14] He's done a whole
[5012.14 → 5012.66] Let's play of
[5012.66 → 5013.38] Ocarina of Time
[5013.38 → 5014.18] It's amazing
[5014.18 → 5015.30] That's incredible
[5015.30 → 5016.36] There are tons of
[5016.36 → 5017.14] All these different people
[5017.14 → 5018.72] Like that is awesome
[5018.72 → 5019.88] And if you donated
[5019.88 → 5020.72] A bunch of money
[5020.72 → 5022.20] To someone who plays
[5022.20 → 5023.40] Call of Duty without hands
[5023.40 → 5024.48] Because he doesn't have any
[5024.48 → 5025.50] Or someone who plays
[5025.50 → 5026.72] Zelda because he's blind
[5026.72 → 5028.00] That's cool
[5028.00 → 5028.28] You're cool
[5028.28 → 5028.80] It's like people who
[5028.80 → 5030.52] Actually have a disability
[5030.52 → 5032.00] So they actually
[5032.00 → 5033.58] Are not able to
[5033.58 → 5034.82] Do other things
[5034.82 → 5035.86] Necessarily as well
[5035.86 → 5036.86] As or as easily
[5036.86 → 5037.56] As other people
[5037.56 → 5038.22] It's like yeah
[5038.22 → 5038.90] That's fine
[5038.90 → 5039.46] Supporting them is cool
[5039.46 → 5040.38] But supporting
[5040.38 → 5041.14] You know
[5041.14 → 5041.88] This guy
[5041.88 → 5042.46] And I'm not saying
[5042.46 → 5043.36] It's the fault of the people
[5043.36 → 5043.90] Who supported him
[5043.90 → 5045.28] Don't take it the wrong way
[5045.28 → 5046.28] But you know
[5046.28 → 5047.22] Someone like this
[5047.22 → 5048.40] Asking for support
[5048.40 → 5050.14] Is just the most offensive
[5050.14 → 5051.08] Kind of wrong
[5051.08 → 5052.24] And like how
[5052.24 → 5053.96] How must that feel
[5053.96 → 5054.88] If you were one of the people
[5054.88 → 5055.46] That were like
[5055.46 → 5056.02] You know what
[5056.02 → 5056.72] This guy's cool
[5056.72 → 5057.82] I want to help him out
[5057.82 → 5058.66] Because it must be hard
[5058.66 → 5059.50] For him right now
[5059.50 → 5061.14] And donated to him
[5061.14 → 5062.00] And then you figure out
[5062.00 → 5062.96] That the guy is a scam
[5062.96 → 5064.72] So in a clip of the incident
[5064.72 → 5066.32] The player is shown
[5066.32 → 5067.94] Leaving a game in progress
[5067.94 → 5068.86] By standing up
[5068.86 → 5070.02] And glancing at the camera
[5070.02 → 5071.32] He doesn't appear to rise
[5071.32 → 5071.92] Entirely straight
[5071.92 → 5072.90] But seems to be walking
[5072.90 → 5073.66] Unaided
[5073.66 → 5074.52] Ah yes
[5074.52 → 5076.14] Here's the miracle clip
[5076.14 → 5077.52] Hopefully you don't lag out
[5077.52 → 5081.76] Oh no it's
[5081.76 → 5082.12] Oh yeah
[5082.12 → 5082.80] It was shared
[5082.80 → 5091.96] So he rolls in
[5091.96 → 5093.04] Like you guys just saw
[5093.04 → 5094.42] Audio's on
[5094.42 → 5094.92] So
[5094.92 → 5096.56] Bring it down
[5096.56 → 5101.12] So he rolls in
[5101.12 → 5102.12] He's talking for a sec
[5102.12 → 5103.74] Skips to the end
[5103.74 → 5105.48] Takes off his headset
[5105.48 → 5106.28] And
[5106.28 → 5106.86] Oh
[5106.86 → 5108.14] Those legs look like
[5108.14 → 5109.08] They work a little bit
[5109.08 → 5110.40] So his girlfriend's
[5110.40 → 5111.34] Trying to tell him in code
[5111.34 → 5112.58] That he left the camera on
[5112.58 → 5115.66] And so the excuses were
[5115.66 → 5117.44] He pushed off his chair
[5117.44 → 5117.90] And
[5117.90 → 5118.90] He said he
[5118.90 → 5120.26] And wiped out
[5120.26 → 5122.06] Which I really don't think happened
[5122.06 → 5122.58] No
[5122.58 → 5123.82] Claimed the dog
[5123.82 → 5124.98] Knocked over his water bowl
[5124.98 → 5126.16] Onto a bunch of cables
[5126.16 → 5127.28] Girlfriend later claimed
[5127.28 → 5127.98] That he was going through
[5127.98 → 5128.64] Physiotherapy
[5128.64 → 5129.54] But it hasn't been
[5129.54 → 5130.38] Working very well
[5130.38 → 5132.46] And apparently you can even see
[5132.46 → 5132.88] I don't
[5132.88 → 5134.06] I haven't been able to see it
[5134.06 → 5134.22] But
[5134.22 → 5135.00] And see he puts
[5135.00 → 5136.14] Points the camera down
[5136.14 → 5137.34] So that he can get back
[5137.34 → 5137.86] Into his chair
[5137.86 → 5138.88] Without anyone seeing him
[5138.88 → 5139.82] Walk into his chair
[5139.82 → 5140.98] Which is brutal
[5140.98 → 5143.10] Like it's just
[5143.10 → 5144.60] So the internet's not
[5144.60 → 5145.74] Impressed with you sir
[5145.74 → 5148.94] Not impressed with you at all
[5148.94 → 5154.26] In happier news
[5154.26 → 5155.72] If we jump away from this
[5155.72 → 5157.46] Our folding team is doing great
[5157.46 → 5159.04] In the chimp competition
[5159.04 → 5159.96] If you haven't heard about it
[5159.96 → 5160.42] Check the post
[5160.42 → 5161.08] Chimp challenge
[5161.08 → 5162.82] Chimp challenge competition
[5162.82 → 5165.06] Jump on the forum
[5165.06 → 5165.76] Check out the post
[5165.76 → 5167.68] Our members of our folding team
[5167.68 → 5168.32] Not everyone
[5168.32 → 5169.88] But a few members of our folding team
[5169.88 → 5171.20] Has joined forces with
[5171.20 → 5173.38] Overclockers.com
[5173.38 → 5173.88] I believe
[5173.88 → 5175.76] Sorry for the bad information
[5175.76 → 5176.56] Blah blah blah blah
[5176.56 → 5178.18] Overclockers.com
[5178.18 → 5178.52] Yes
[5178.52 → 5179.78] So we've joined forces with them
[5179.78 → 5180.56] Because it was too late
[5180.56 → 5181.30] For us to sign up with
[5181.30 → 5182.26] As a team
[5182.26 → 5183.60] And we're not actually
[5183.60 → 5184.68] Big enough yet
[5184.68 → 5186.40] But we are one of the
[5186.40 → 5187.44] Fastest growing teams
[5187.44 → 5188.20] So we're thinking
[5188.20 → 5189.62] By this time next year
[5189.62 → 5190.34] We should actually be
[5190.34 → 5191.08] Big enough to compete
[5191.08 → 5192.02] Which is pretty crazy
[5192.02 → 5193.44] Because not that many teams
[5193.44 → 5194.18] That's very new
[5194.18 → 5194.90] Yeah
[5194.90 → 5195.68] And
[5195.68 → 5196.30] Yeah
[5196.30 → 5197.36] Our team's really new
[5197.36 → 5198.98] So yeah
[5198.98 → 5199.72] Go help them out
[5199.72 → 5200.46] The chimp competition
[5200.46 → 5201.46] Like honestly
[5201.46 → 5204.80] You're just pushing for a good cause
[5204.80 → 5206.10] Like it's a fun competition
[5206.10 → 5206.60] Yeah
[5206.60 → 5208.12] To help everyone on the plan
[5208.12 → 5209.08] There are no losers
[5209.08 → 5209.90] Yeah
[5209.90 → 5211.22] So that's cool
[5211.22 → 5212.72] Except that guy in the wheelchair
[5212.72 → 5213.82] Who doesn't actually
[5213.82 → 5214.76] That jerk face
[5214.76 → 5215.24] Who can walk
[5215.24 → 5216.40] Hopefully we don't help him
[5216.40 → 5216.86] Yeah
[5216.86 → 5218.30] Anyway
[5218.30 → 5219.16] That's
[5219.16 → 5219.62] Yeah
[5219.62 → 5220.50] But yeah
[5220.50 → 5221.90] Check out the chimp competition
[5221.90 → 5223.62] Whaler
[5223.62 → 5224.68] One of the mods on our forum
[5224.68 → 5226.24] That manages all this kind of stuff
[5226.24 → 5228.08] Is building a 4p folding system
[5228.08 → 5229.60] Which is just going to be
[5229.60 → 5230.90] Absolutely
[5230.90 → 5232.46] Insane
[5232.46 → 5234.90] He's going to be making a post about it soon
[5234.90 → 5236.12] But his folding setup
[5236.12 → 5237.46] Is just monstrous
[5237.46 → 5238.46] 4p for the record
[5238.46 → 5240.36] Doesn't mean that it facilitates urination
[5240.36 → 5241.44] It means that it has
[5241.44 → 5242.40] Four processors
[5242.40 → 5252.08] Oh man
[5252.08 → 5254.48] Let's do a little bit of
[5254.48 → 5255.16] Q&A
[5255.16 → 5256.64] I think that's it for our topics
[5256.64 → 5257.38] For the night though
[5257.38 → 5259.80] Yeah I know
[5259.80 → 5261.44] So we're just going to do
[5261.44 → 5262.32] A little bit of Twitter
[5262.32 → 5263.10] Oh you know what
[5263.10 → 5263.56] Actually
[5263.56 → 5264.88] We're going to close off
[5264.88 → 5265.90] The live stream here
[5265.90 → 5266.68] Because
[5266.68 → 5268.70] We've noticed that people
[5268.70 → 5270.34] Aren't really watching it for
[5270.34 → 5271.42] Well you might want to
[5271.42 → 5272.36] Okay we're going to come back
[5272.36 → 5272.60] As much on YouTube
[5272.60 → 5273.40] Yeah we'll be back
[5273.40 → 5275.92] So we'll be back for After Party
[5275.92 → 5278.36] But we are no longer going to be
[5278.36 → 5280.26] Uploading the After Party segment
[5280.26 → 5281.12] To YouTube
[5281.12 → 5282.88] So to do that
[5282.88 → 5283.74] What we're going to have to do
[5283.74 → 5284.82] Is cut the stream for a second
[5284.82 → 5285.02] Yeah
[5285.02 → 5286.02] And we'll be right back
[5286.02 → 5286.62] We'll be right back
[5286.62 → 5287.20] Give us a moment
[5287.20 → 5289.90] Thanks for watching tonight everyone
[5289.90 → 5291.20] Who's tuning out now
[5291.20 → 5291.64] Or who's
[5291.64 → 5292.70] Well we have to do an outro
[5292.70 → 5294.24] Because when people watch this on YouTube
[5294.24 → 5294.94] There has to be
[5294.94 → 5297.00] Remember how many people complained that night
[5297.00 → 5297.18] Right
[5297.18 → 5298.22] When we didn't say goodbye
[5298.22 → 5298.80] Right
[5298.80 → 5299.54] Bye
[5299.54 → 5301.16] Bye everyone watching on YouTube
[5301.16 → 5302.96] And we'll be back
[5302.96 → 5303.56] See you in a minute everyone
[5303.56 → 5304.40] Everyone that's live
[5304.40 → 5305.06] That's live
[5305.06 → 5305.84] That's live on Twitch
[5305.84 → 5306.90] When we actually film this
[5306.90 → 5308.22] Like, comment, subscribe, favourite, share
[5308.22 → 5309.46] What else can you do?
[5309.50 → 5310.32] Is there anything else you can do?
[5311.28 → 5313.04] You can give us money for a wheelchair
[5313.04 → 5314.46] That we apparently don't need
[5314.46 → 5315.40] My legs don't work
[5315.40 → 5316.28] Yeah please don't do that
[5316.28 → 5317.96] Don't watch any videos that we've done recently
[5317.96 → 5318.72] My legs don't work
[5318.72 → 5321.42] What a jerk
[5321.42 → 5322.42] Horrible
[5322.42 → 5322.72] Horrible
[5322.72 → 5323.42] Horrible
[5323.42 → 5324.06] Horrible
[5324.06 → 5350.64] Heh
