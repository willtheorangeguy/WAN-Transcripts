[0.00 → 4.08] There it goes, there it goes. Alright guys, we're live! Welcome to the Linus Tech Tips
[4.08 → 9.94] live stream featuring the one and only Slick PC in spite of that one guy who keeps asking me to
[9.94 → 18.34] fire him. I haven't done it yet. Today. Today. Are this mine? No. Oh. Where'd mine go? Oh, there they are.
[18.96 → 23.84] We both have the same earbuds which causes no small amount of confusion, or would cause no
[23.84 → 27.86] small amount of confusion if we ever put them in a pile next to each other, which would be a bit of
[27.86 → 32.94] a problem. So we're both using Flux in Ear Pros. What do you think of them? I like them. Did you ever try the
[32.94 → 39.88] non-pros? Yeah. I didn't mind those. They were good, but I like how well these will hook around your ear.
[40.28 → 44.62] Right. And how well they sit in your ear. The only complaint I have about the non-pros is like these
[44.62 → 48.76] ones, they talked about when we were in their suite that they're designed after hearing aids, right?
[48.86 → 53.50] Yeah. So they fit in your ear really well, and they don't really come out of your ear that much.
[53.66 → 56.60] Right. And then the cable can go right up and around your ear, so there's not a lot of tension.
[56.60 → 62.20] With the non-pros, they're designed to kind of stick out of your ear and then go down.
[63.54 → 65.62] So they stick fairly far out and then go straight down.
[65.66 → 70.90] You know what I discovered, though, is that with the non-pros, if you really jam them in there.
[71.24 → 71.46] Yeah.
[71.64 → 75.82] Well, hold on. No, no, really, though. That's why they're so long. You're supposed to...
[75.82 → 82.78] I found if I put a size smaller ear tip on it, and then I put them right in, not only did they sound great,
[82.88 → 86.92] the noise isolation was outstanding, and they didn't stick out really far anymore.
[87.10 → 90.24] I'm even able to lie down on them without them being uncomfortable.
[91.02 → 93.04] So there. There's sort of...
[93.04 → 94.92] That's pretty cool. I didn't go that far with it. I don't like...
[94.92 → 100.34] Right. Yeah, fair enough. Because they're more like in-ear canal, almost.
[100.80 → 102.42] Yeah, which is kind of weird.
[102.58 → 104.02] Well, it's not for everyone, that's for sure.
[104.10 → 106.80] And wouldn't that be worse, too, for your ears?
[107.56 → 109.38] I mean, if you cranked it, maybe, sure.
[109.74 → 110.02] Yeah.
[110.24 → 110.98] I would think so.
[111.34 → 111.58] Yeah.
[111.58 → 114.30] All right, so what's our first topic for the week?
[114.32 → 116.20] Sorry if my voice sucks, guys. I'm kind of sick.
[117.94 → 118.34] Yeah.
[118.82 → 119.98] I know that's a common topic.
[120.18 → 122.20] Yeah. We sort of talk about that a lot.
[122.34 → 123.06] But, yeah.
[123.34 → 125.64] Let's move on to a new topic.
[125.92 → 134.10] So our first topic of the week is Tomb Raider 2013 edition is already 50% off on Steam.
[136.00 → 137.56] It's not even the summer sale yet.
[137.56 → 140.02] Like, I kind of expected stuff like this in the summer sale.
[140.38 → 143.64] Because the Steam summer sale is always, like, just the most ridiculous thing ever.
[143.74 → 146.18] It's like, please stay inside and play video games.
[146.18 → 147.06] I don't even...
[147.06 → 150.42] For a few months, I've started doing this, like, a few months back.
[150.62 → 154.12] And until the summer sale comes around, what I do is I'll actually...
[154.12 → 157.72] For any games that I hear of that I want, and any games that go on sale,
[158.02 → 159.26] that I'm like, oh, that looks interesting,
[159.66 → 163.00] I put it in a list in a notepad on my computer, and I just wait.
[163.22 → 166.00] Even if it goes on, like, a crazy weekend-only sale, I'm like,
[166.00 → 168.24] yeah, I'll just put that in a list, wait for the summer sale.
[169.50 → 170.66] Because it's so cheap.
[170.74 → 173.66] It's basically like Boxing Week.
[174.18 → 179.02] Or, I guess, for the American viewers, kind of like a Black Friday type thing.
[179.12 → 180.26] It's kind of awesome.
[180.42 → 182.64] It's just not worthwhile to buy anything any other time.
[183.14 → 187.08] But, I mean, this comes back to our discussion about Crisis 3.
[187.08 → 191.10] So, that came out, and then it was discounted within a couple of weeks,
[191.30 → 194.96] in spite of being evidently a hot-selling title.
[195.28 → 197.02] Should you pre-order anything?
[198.58 → 199.02] Ever.
[199.02 → 204.80] See, like, at this point, the main reason why I would ever see to pre-order anything
[204.80 → 208.20] is if you can find a place where you're going to get some amount of benefit from it.
[208.80 → 211.02] Because, like, sometimes Steam will do the
[211.14 → 213.82] oh, if enough people pre-order, and you always hit the third tier.
[214.16 → 215.92] And there are three tiers of pre-order benefits.
[216.40 → 218.34] And sometimes, like, it comes with other games.
[218.72 → 218.98] Right.
[219.10 → 222.96] And it'll come with, like, other games, DLC, like, all this stuff.
[222.96 → 226.52] So, sometimes the pre-order benefits are huge and exclusive.
[227.14 → 228.88] So, sometimes it's worth it.
[229.04 → 231.78] I have Bill's hat in Team Fortress 2.
[231.84 → 232.04] See?
[232.32 → 233.78] Like, stuff like that.
[234.20 → 237.16] But that's, I think, where the benefit of buying early is going to be now,
[237.22 → 237.96] because it's not...
[237.96 → 238.82] Price.
[239.08 → 240.24] It's not priced anymore.
[240.44 → 240.64] Yeah.
[240.74 → 245.90] It's, like, two, three weeks, four weeks after it actually comes out.
[245.98 → 248.60] It's already, like, yeah.
[249.82 → 250.96] So, someone says...
[250.96 → 254.68] Yeah, people are still complaining about the audio levels.
[254.86 → 257.46] I actually don't understand.
[259.22 → 259.62] Okay.
[259.84 → 260.02] Here.
[260.10 → 261.48] We can try moving it a little closer.
[262.52 → 263.72] That might actually help.
[264.84 → 265.60] The mic?
[266.08 → 266.38] Yeah.
[268.18 → 269.16] We will try.
[269.70 → 271.12] We just said audio is great.
[272.16 → 272.36] Okay.
[272.36 → 273.36] Well, I just did it a little bit.
[275.58 → 275.98] Okay.
[276.28 → 280.00] It's easier to turn down than it is for people who are maxed out to turn it up.
[280.00 → 282.04] So, I understand.
[283.42 → 283.82] Yeah.
[284.96 → 286.48] I understand why that's a problem.
[286.56 → 288.46] Why don't we turn to a little bit of Twitter Q&A?
[289.02 → 290.86] So, let's go ahead and do this.
[291.14 → 291.40] Oh!
[291.60 → 292.12] Oh, yeah.
[292.16 → 292.74] Another topic.
[292.90 → 297.82] Actually, before we go any further, is our after party this week,
[297.96 → 300.20] assuming Slick and I can get it working,
[300.94 → 302.04] we'll probably get it working, right?
[302.18 → 302.76] I would think so.
[302.76 → 304.78] Is going to be our Super Mario World livestream!
[306.08 → 306.26] Yay!
[306.26 → 307.48] At least, like, the start of it.
[307.56 → 308.36] At least the start of it.
[308.36 → 309.78] We'll probably have to do more than one segment.
[309.98 → 310.14] Yeah.
[310.20 → 311.42] It's not going to be in one sitting.
[311.72 → 313.40] I mean, the reality of it is,
[313.74 → 317.46] I told my wife about the concept of the Super Mario World livestream,
[317.46 → 319.06] and she was kind of like,
[320.24 → 324.32] I mean, you can't expect wives to necessarily always get the whole, like, game stream.
[324.40 → 328.20] Quite frankly, I don't really get the whole game streaming thing, but, I mean.
[328.28 → 331.28] It's more, for us, we're not doing, like, a Let's Play.
[331.72 → 333.82] This is more of just, we're doing a normal,
[333.94 → 335.98] we're probably going to be talking about random stuff,
[336.04 → 337.28] just like we do in the after party.
[337.40 → 337.56] Yeah.
[337.56 → 340.52] But just, instead of the whole screen being us,
[340.58 → 343.48] it'll probably be a small webcam view, and then Super Mario World.
[343.70 → 345.92] And, like, who doesn't like Super Mario World?
[345.94 → 347.04] Can I have a webcam view of you?
[348.66 → 349.40] What are you wearing?
[351.04 → 352.58] That's true, I can see what you're wearing.
[353.58 → 355.90] Your exposed knees are very sensual today.
[358.38 → 359.18] Exposed knees.
[359.20 → 363.08] Well, Slick wear shorts to work, which, I mean, I'm not the best dressed gentleman.
[363.08 → 364.30] You wear sandals.
[364.84 → 367.18] That's true, but sandals are very practical.
[367.18 → 369.10] And you only wear nice shirts when you need to.
[369.86 → 371.06] Yes, that is true.
[371.32 → 374.80] If you're not going to be in front of camera, you wear, like, badminton shirts and stuff.
[374.96 → 375.94] Yes, that's true.
[377.02 → 379.02] You probably just don't like, how many shorts do you own?
[380.12 → 381.48] A couple.
[381.62 → 382.28] They're all the same.
[382.62 → 383.76] And you probably don't like them, do you?
[383.76 → 386.78] I have three pairs of jean shorts that I actually don't like,
[386.84 → 387.88] because they make my butt look big.
[388.22 → 390.20] There, so that's why you don't wear shorts.
[390.66 → 391.72] I love shorts.
[392.24 → 393.22] Shorts are amazing.
[393.40 → 394.94] Okay, that actually could be part of the reason.
[394.94 → 397.90] All right, so moving along to Twitter Q&A.
[398.32 → 401.36] Ah, watching from Norway, but not at a LAN party.
[402.06 → 403.90] Second time tuning in from Austria.
[404.08 → 409.54] I think this new time slot really does work well for a lot of people really, really well.
[409.82 → 413.32] George says apparently there's a giveaway of leftover Steam codes on the forum.
[413.52 → 413.74] Cool.
[413.74 → 415.56] That actually happens, like, a lot.
[415.72 → 416.42] Yeah, it's neat.
[416.58 → 420.72] If you're, if you don't have many Steam games, like, honestly, hang around the forum.
[421.06 → 425.76] There's, there's one guy that does Steam giveaways all the time for just drawing him random things.
[426.20 → 426.94] That's kind of cool.
[427.02 → 429.50] And he'll pick, like, not the best drawing at all.
[429.70 → 434.52] He'll pick, like, the thing that he just kind of likes the most, and usually it has nothing to do with the best drawing at all.
[434.58 → 435.58] It's just what makes him laugh.
[435.74 → 436.64] So that's pretty cool.
[437.02 → 438.74] I know one of our mods has done a giveaway.
[439.44 → 441.78] I know, like, there are a lot of giveaways on the forum, actually.
[442.66 → 450.68] Speaking of giveaways on the forum, the user Dragon tail submitted a Mass Effect 2 Steam code, or I think, oh crap, I think it's an origin code.
[451.36 → 452.62] Yeah, I think it's an origin code.
[452.70 → 457.12] But one way or another, it's a free copy of Mass Effect 2 that he sort of told me I could give away on the live stream.
[457.50 → 466.32] So instead, I opted to give it away on the forum in the DA-da-da-da-da-da, I'm going to see if I can remember what my hotkey is for this one.
[467.04 → 470.42] This, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.
[470.68 → 471.56] Oh, uh-oh.
[472.28 → 473.32] We'll be back in a moment.
[474.02 → 474.74] What are you doing?
[481.74 → 482.76] What's going on?
[483.82 → 485.08] There we go.
[486.36 → 486.82] All right.
[486.82 → 493.20] So in this thread here called the Post Linus Memes Here thread, which actually has some pretty funny stuff.
[493.28 → 494.34] Okay, this one's not that great.
[494.68 → 501.76] But basically the winner, selected by me and Slick, is going to win a copy of Mass Effect 2.
[501.86 → 503.72] And I think it's just sort of for fun.
[504.40 → 505.80] Twitter's up and running, and it's gone.
[507.00 → 507.64] Love it.
[507.82 → 510.26] I have to keep going until I find my favourite one.
[510.98 → 514.10] I don't actually burst out laughing at that much stuff I see on the internet.
[514.24 → 516.14] But this thread has got me going a couple of times.
[516.22 → 518.58] Yeah, this thread's actually just kind of awesome.
[519.44 → 520.20] But where is it?
[520.28 → 520.62] Here we go.
[520.66 → 521.00] Here we go.
[521.06 → 521.42] Oh, no.
[521.56 → 521.84] Oh, yeah.
[521.84 → 522.40] That one's not bad.
[522.44 → 523.00] That one's not bad.
[523.04 → 526.08] But there's another Slick one that I think is my personal favourite so far.
[526.08 → 528.56] I don't remember where it is.
[528.68 → 529.58] I don't remember where it is, too.
[529.62 → 530.74] I think it's pretty early on.
[531.00 → 531.76] I like this.
[531.80 → 532.18] Have you seen this?
[532.18 → 532.48] Oh, yeah.
[532.56 → 533.40] Yeah, I saw this one.
[533.50 → 534.22] Oh, my goodness.
[534.40 → 535.36] That was so funny.
[535.50 → 536.16] Okay, you know what?
[536.20 → 536.44] Hold on.
[536.46 → 538.50] We're going to cut back to us for a second.
[538.64 → 541.04] V Bulletin has taken care of us at this point.
[541.14 → 542.30] They've issued a full refund.
[542.56 → 544.56] So we are now square with them.
[544.62 → 545.16] It's all good.
[545.34 → 545.52] Yeah.
[545.80 → 546.90] Still funny, though.
[547.30 → 548.48] This one's just terrifying.
[548.50 → 549.18] This is weird.
[549.82 → 551.38] I mean, there's like a black Linus.
[552.96 → 554.34] I've never seen that before.
[556.08 → 560.32] Okay, I think it's got to be page three because it was pretty early on.
[564.46 → 565.42] Okay, hold on.
[565.52 → 566.40] Close cell phone.
[566.96 → 567.40] Hold on.
[567.46 → 567.72] Hold on.
[567.76 → 568.10] Hold on.
[568.46 → 568.92] Trust me.
[569.00 → 569.46] Trust me.
[570.00 → 570.90] It's worth it.
[571.32 → 571.60] Oh.
[572.26 → 573.56] I thought it was on page three.
[576.44 → 576.88] Okay.
[577.20 → 578.02] Close cell phone.
[578.18 → 578.36] Yep.
[578.44 → 578.66] Yep.
[578.74 → 578.96] Yep.
[579.06 → 579.32] Yep.
[580.02 → 580.86] Final assembly.
[581.98 → 582.40] Okay.
[582.50 → 582.78] Okay.
[582.90 → 583.22] Yep.
[583.22 → 583.62] No.
[584.30 → 584.66] No.
[584.66 → 587.22] Did someone get rid of it?
[587.90 → 588.34] Maybe.
[588.84 → 589.62] That's bizarre.
[589.80 → 589.94] Okay.
[590.02 → 594.62] Well, there's a slick one that we both saw that we both really liked that I thought was
[594.62 → 596.70] quoted in here a few times.
[596.96 → 598.44] A lot of people talked about it.
[598.90 → 604.64] But it was basically slick giving a big thumbs up with the caption EA at the bottom.
[604.64 → 609.56] And I have no idea what happened here.
[609.70 → 611.16] I haven't seen some of these.
[611.80 → 612.42] So anyway.
[612.42 → 613.14] It must be gone.
[613.22 → 614.82] Guys, feel free to post in the thread.
[614.94 → 620.06] You can win a free copy of Mass Effect 2 courtesy of Dragon Tail, one of the members of our forum.
[620.06 → 624.56] All right.
[624.66 → 625.24] So back to Twitter.
[625.40 → 625.54] Right.
[625.60 → 626.42] That's where we left off.
[627.12 → 628.06] I was like, so...
[629.52 → 631.88] Are you ready for Haswell?
[632.20 → 633.52] We have Haswell chips.
[633.64 → 635.34] We have Haswell boards coming soon.
[635.46 → 641.62] We had a conversation with ASUS that involves a lot of really cool stuff heading our way.
[641.62 → 647.22] So we're going to be hopefully doing, like, some build guides and some benchmarks and talking
[647.22 → 649.72] about Haswell a whole heck of a lot.
[650.76 → 654.14] Andy wants to know when we're expecting the NVIDIA 700 series.
[654.38 → 655.12] We have no idea.
[655.58 → 657.66] And if we did, we wouldn't be able to tell you.
[657.90 → 660.34] So if we did, I would tell you.
[660.42 → 661.14] We have no idea.
[661.38 → 662.18] So there you go.
[662.26 → 663.52] That should tell you all you need to know.
[664.38 → 666.74] Slick, have you tried Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon yet?
[667.16 → 667.52] No.
[668.46 → 669.14] Why not?
[669.54 → 670.76] Well, I don't have a code yet.
[670.76 → 671.64] Oh.
[672.98 → 674.10] Well, you have a Never Settle.
[674.48 → 674.78] Yeah.
[675.20 → 676.24] But they haven't sent out...
[676.24 → 678.26] I don't think Never Settle has sent out their codes yet.
[679.24 → 681.70] So I'm waiting for Never Settle to send out their codes.
[682.02 → 684.80] And then I will play the crap out of Blood Dragon.
[685.04 → 686.06] I'm so excited.
[686.70 → 687.96] You saw that GIF I showed you, right?
[688.24 → 688.58] Yes.
[688.84 → 691.26] There's a GIF where two guys are fighting on the road.
[691.26 → 696.16] And then some gigantic techno lizard just dives by and takes the guy out.
[696.28 → 698.00] I'm just like, oh, I'm so excited about this game.
[699.08 → 700.46] It's so 80s.
[700.46 → 701.38] Oh, my goodness.
[701.98 → 702.92] I'm so excited.
[705.80 → 707.46] So what's up with Haswell?
[707.96 → 710.86] What would you expect from online gaming platforms in the future?
[711.04 → 714.16] We've talked about that a fair bit, I think, already on previous live streams.
[715.04 → 718.30] 15th top poster on the forums today is apparently Dylan Grant.
[718.52 → 718.92] Nice.
[719.18 → 719.60] Awesome.
[720.40 → 720.66] Yes.
[720.74 → 722.56] Super Mario finally is coming.
[722.72 → 723.98] Here, do you want to shook forward a little bit?
[724.02 → 725.14] Apparently you're a little out of focus.
[725.14 → 725.22] Yes.
[725.76 → 727.56] Tuning in from Sweden at 1 a.m.
[727.56 → 728.52] Love it, guys.
[728.60 → 729.84] Thank you for tuning in.
[730.60 → 732.86] And apparently lots of new interactions.
[733.14 → 734.52] Oh, this is interesting.
[734.64 → 736.76] So we got our hands on a 79.90 today.
[736.76 → 745.24] But the only hands on time we had with it was to basically just like video the card itself.
[745.48 → 749.26] We didn't actually get a chance to benchmark it at all, which was sort of disappointing.
[749.26 → 753.18] So that made me sad.
[753.86 → 757.78] But hopefully we'll get a chance to really benchmark it.
[757.82 → 763.78] But the problem with benchmarking the 79.90 is that due to the fact that it's running Crossfire
[763.78 → 770.24] and AMD's drivers aren't really optimized for the best frame times,
[770.46 → 776.92] the frame rates might be really high, but the actual perceived performance is not necessarily that high on a Crossfire solution right now.
[776.92 → 782.96] And unless you have a really high-end capture PC with some special software
[782.96 → 788.30] and a lot of time to sit down and really go through frame by frame what was actually being displayed,
[788.50 → 795.20] it's really hard to get performance numbers for Crossfire these days until AMD fix the issue.
[795.28 → 801.38] They have a prototype driver that looks a lot better, but its nowhere near available to the public yet.
[801.74 → 803.70] It's supposed to be like 20% increase, right?
[803.70 → 806.02] Oh, way better. Way better than that.
[806.28 → 810.96] Like in terms of the perceived performance and the perceived stuttering-ness of it,
[811.32 → 812.60] it's supposed to be absolutely way better.
[812.68 → 814.72] Can you email that to me so that I can open it up over there?
[814.86 → 815.00] Yeah.
[816.34 → 817.54] All right, so we found...
[817.54 → 818.56] I'm trying to get the user's name.
[818.64 → 823.60] We found the meme that was sort of mine and Slick's favourite so far
[823.74 → 828.96] that we dug through a thread only to find out it isn't there anymore for some reason.
[829.08 → 831.82] I have no idea why, so we're going to bring that up soon.
[831.82 → 833.86] We're going to have a guest next week.
[833.92 → 835.14] I don't know if I told you this yet.
[835.78 → 838.76] You vaguely mentioned something, but I don't actually know what's going on.
[839.00 → 840.52] Okay, so our guest...
[840.52 → 843.82] I'm just going to open up our live stream agenda here, and I'll take you to his website.
[844.34 → 847.14] So he's a bit of a local technology media personality.
[847.86 → 850.34] He goes by the name of Steve Motto.
[851.24 → 852.08] So there you go.
[852.32 → 853.16] He's got a website.
[853.42 → 855.22] He does more radio stuff.
[855.22 → 859.40] He's a little bit more focused on the business side of the technology
[859.40 → 865.04] and how to enable yourself to sort of save time and make your life a little bit better with it.
[865.08 → 868.08] He doesn't focus on graphics cards or stuff like that.
[868.14 → 871.04] So I asked him to come do a 20-minute segment or so.
[871.16 → 873.18] He does a lot of speaking engagements locally.
[874.00 → 878.66] So, yeah, I had a meeting with him, and he was interested in coming in and joining us.
[878.66 → 883.54] So I think it'll be interesting to just kind of do the whole guest thing again and see how it goes.
[884.26 → 885.06] Very knowledgeable.
[885.48 → 886.64] He's been doing...
[886.64 → 891.94] I mean, he's run TV broadcast tech shows in the past.
[892.22 → 893.88] He's done online tech shows.
[893.98 → 895.30] Like I said, he does radio now.
[895.36 → 896.12] Extremely experienced.
[896.26 → 898.76] He's been doing tech talks since...
[898.76 → 905.58] I mean, I basically knew where to find the turbo button on a 386 or 486
[905.58 → 907.54] or whichever one was the one that came with a turbo button,
[907.64 → 908.84] or they can't even remember anymore.
[909.44 → 911.10] So, yeah, that should be kind of fun.
[912.14 → 916.12] I don't know how carefully you've gone through some of the topics that I submitted for the live stream,
[916.24 → 918.32] but have you seen this yet?
[918.78 → 919.06] Yeah.
[920.10 → 920.46] Crazy.
[920.86 → 923.08] So, guys, check this out.
[923.26 → 924.60] I don't know what ad that is.
[924.60 → 928.40] But this is from NoFilmSchool.com.
[928.90 → 935.40] Netflix streaming loses 2,000 titles as Universal and MGM licenses expire.
[935.98 → 941.80] So, there's a lot of talk right now about what the heck does this actually mean,
[942.00 → 944.54] and I'm going to throw this at Slick.
[944.66 → 945.78] So, what's your take on this?
[946.70 → 948.70] I'm kind of worried about Netflix.
[949.90 → 951.18] It's actually pretty brutal.
[951.32 → 952.10] That's so many titles.
[953.16 → 953.64] 1794?
[954.42 → 955.40] 1794 titles.
[955.40 → 955.60] 1794 titles.
[956.60 → 962.26] And I guess the thing that sort of got a lot of people scratching their heads right now
[962.26 → 969.48] is that at the same time, Warner Brothers is launching their archival video service,
[969.80 → 973.24] which is more focused on older and obscure titles,
[973.24 → 978.36] but there's some overlap with the stuff that the license just expired from Netflix for.
[979.76 → 986.02] And it's like, okay, so you got your own service now.
[986.42 → 989.96] Netflix is branching out into content creation now.
[990.06 → 990.86] Like crazy.
[990.90 → 992.46] Like crazy they're investing.
[992.46 → 994.08] But they're apparently really liking it, too.
[994.74 → 997.68] So, I mean, at some point in the future,
[998.98 → 1003.94] does Netflix become pretty much the same as any other content delivery company,
[1004.42 → 1008.04] except they were the kick in the pants that forces the other guys
[1008.04 → 1011.36] to figure out this whole digital content distribution thing?
[1011.46 → 1011.74] Right.
[1012.22 → 1014.30] The reason why everyone pirates everything.
[1014.30 → 1018.74] So maybe at some point, I mean, what I've loved about Netflix,
[1018.82 → 1021.42] I've only used Netflix for, I had it for a few weeks,
[1021.92 → 1025.30] because I'm a cheapskate and I don't really watch movies.
[1026.46 → 1028.64] Like, I just actually don't watch movies.
[1028.88 → 1031.32] I've watched one movie since my son was born.
[1032.26 → 1033.48] And that was over a year ago.
[1033.88 → 1034.92] I went to see The Hobbit.
[1035.60 → 1036.24] That was it.
[1037.14 → 1037.98] It's like, okay.
[1038.60 → 1039.64] So I don't really watch movies.
[1039.68 → 1040.80] So I didn't have it for long.
[1040.80 → 1045.42] But what I liked about it is that you weren't locked into this service
[1045.42 → 1048.28] or that service or that service to the point where all of a sudden,
[1048.42 → 1051.66] if you're paying $7 a month for 10 different services,
[1051.66 → 1053.68] it costs just as much as a cable subscription,
[1053.84 → 1056.72] which is what I'm trying to get rid of at that point.
[1057.60 → 1060.26] So are we moving towards more fragmentation
[1060.26 → 1063.24] where each of the studios maintains their own content library?
[1064.18 → 1067.18] Is someone like YouTube going to win to the point
[1067.18 → 1068.70] where they get all the original programming?
[1069.02 → 1070.74] Well, it could explode.
[1070.80 → 1071.76] And then come back in.
[1072.16 → 1074.30] Because they're doing the subscriber thing on YouTube.
[1074.50 → 1075.82] Like, everyone is trying to...
[1075.82 → 1077.98] You know how YouTube rolled out their...
[1077.98 → 1080.22] Like, you can set up your channel as a subscription base?
[1080.38 → 1080.70] Yes.
[1081.74 → 1086.32] Everyone is kind of rolling out their own big content subscription setup.
[1086.74 → 1089.10] And I'm wondering if everyone...
[1089.10 → 1090.76] All the users are going to go,
[1090.80 → 1092.00] this is too much crap.
[1092.00 → 1096.62] And, like, they're going to want to go back to just one group
[1096.62 → 1097.60] that maybe charges more.
[1098.42 → 1100.98] So maybe it's going to get out of Netflix's hands for a while.
[1101.36 → 1103.92] And then someone, whether it's Netflix or maybe someone else,
[1103.98 → 1105.34] might be able to pull it all back together.
[1105.52 → 1107.48] Because it's going to be frustrating managing, like,
[1107.80 → 1111.04] 10 different subscriptions for all your stuff.
[1111.10 → 1111.32] Oh, yeah.
[1111.36 → 1112.02] It's just ridiculous.
[1112.02 → 1112.68] It's annoying.
[1112.68 → 1115.28] That would be kind of interesting.
[1115.60 → 1117.04] It was nice with, like, United States-based Netflix.
[1117.24 → 1118.86] Canadian Netflix was never really that strong.
[1119.28 → 1120.62] But United States-based Netflix,
[1120.82 → 1122.40] where you just kind of had everything.
[1123.18 → 1123.54] Yeah.
[1123.94 → 1125.42] Almost all the movies you could think of.
[1125.48 → 1126.18] Tons of documentaries.
[1126.40 → 1126.98] All the shows.
[1127.12 → 1127.38] Almost.
[1127.64 → 1128.44] And quite frankly,
[1128.52 → 1130.72] that's the kind of thing I could see myself subscribing to.
[1130.78 → 1134.12] Whereas Canadian Netflix really wasn't that special.
[1134.50 → 1134.74] Yeah.
[1134.96 → 1135.48] VPNs.
[1135.48 → 1137.70] VPN, true enough.
[1139.46 → 1139.84] But, yeah.
[1139.94 → 1142.70] So there's a lot of stuff being pulled off.
[1142.86 → 1143.90] So things like...
[1143.90 → 1144.58] So hold on.
[1144.66 → 1144.94] Hold on.
[1145.54 → 1145.92] Here we go.
[1146.00 → 1148.02] So South Park is off.
[1148.32 → 1149.42] But it's not that big of a deal,
[1149.50 → 1151.74] because you can watch South Park online legally anyway.
[1152.68 → 1155.06] Audrey Rose, James Bond classics,
[1155.20 → 1156.50] like Dr. No and Goldfinger.
[1156.74 → 1158.10] Because those are still pretty good to watch.
[1158.30 → 1160.30] So Netflix's take on this is,
[1160.38 → 1160.88] you know what?
[1160.96 → 1163.00] Our library has always been in flux.
[1163.48 → 1164.92] We're also adding...
[1164.92 → 1166.96] I think they said they were adding several...
[1166.96 → 1169.30] Yeah, 500 titles are being added May 1st.
[1169.30 → 1170.36] So that was two days ago.
[1170.48 → 1171.80] So they're losing almost 1,800.
[1172.68 → 1175.00] But a lot of them are very possibly ancient
[1175.00 → 1176.80] that people possibly aren't watching that much.
[1176.90 → 1178.38] So they're adding Bachelorette,
[1178.50 → 1179.70] adding Hunger Games,
[1180.00 → 1181.30] adding Mission Impossible 2.
[1182.04 → 1182.94] I mean, it's one of those things
[1182.94 → 1184.94] where if you're subscribing to Netflix as a service,
[1184.94 → 1185.68] it's kind of like,
[1186.06 → 1186.94] if I turn it on,
[1187.00 → 1188.04] there'll be something to watch.
[1189.68 → 1191.18] Mission probably accomplished,
[1191.26 → 1192.94] as long as they can maintain...
[1192.94 → 1194.84] Well, especially the States,
[1194.92 → 1197.26] where I think this is going on.
[1197.36 → 1197.56] Yeah.
[1197.64 → 1199.72] Because they have so much stuff.
[1201.88 → 1203.72] Which actually reminds me,
[1203.84 → 1206.26] there was huge news the other day
[1206.26 → 1208.16] that I actually didn't have in our livestream,
[1209.16 → 1210.64] in our livestream document,
[1210.80 → 1211.84] but I'm going to open this up.
[1211.88 → 1213.14] I just moved it over there now.
[1213.30 → 1218.00] So the first major YouTube channel acquisition
[1218.00 → 1219.10] just went down.
[1219.10 → 1223.00] So DreamWorks announced the acquisition of Awesomeness TV
[1223.00 → 1225.08] for $33 million,
[1226.06 → 1227.90] which is absolutely incredible.
[1228.76 → 1230.90] So Awesomeness TV was...
[1231.46 → 1231.78] Ahem.
[1232.52 → 1232.88] Okay.
[1233.04 → 1233.90] Mark Etterbeek.
[1234.40 → 1235.12] And hold on.
[1235.58 → 1236.02] Yeah.
[1236.02 → 1239.36] So he's basically been involved in some other...
[1239.98 → 1240.40] So, okay.
[1240.46 → 1240.72] Yeah, yeah.
[1240.72 → 1241.02] Here we go.
[1241.08 → 1242.16] The key to this success,
[1242.28 → 1243.18] according to Etterbeek,
[1243.50 → 1246.50] was Robin's experience creating traditional television content
[1246.50 → 1247.30] aimed at young viewers,
[1247.36 → 1249.36] such as Millville and One Tree Hill.
[1249.54 → 1251.28] So they basically took this channel.
[1251.36 → 1252.92] They got one of YouTube's grants.
[1253.02 → 1253.36] I think they got...
[1253.36 → 1254.36] They got...
[1254.36 → 1255.74] Three and a half...
[1255.74 → 1256.82] Yeah, three and a half million
[1256.82 → 1258.54] from the Series A round last summer,
[1258.72 → 1260.20] which added to a five million
[1260.20 → 1261.72] original content grant from YouTube.
[1262.10 → 1263.78] So they got a bunch of money
[1263.78 → 1264.90] to build this channel.
[1265.00 → 1267.34] They built it up to 500,000 subscribers
[1267.34 → 1270.08] and around 80 million monthly views.
[1270.20 → 1271.52] So this was on Panda Daily,
[1271.66 → 1273.44] just so that we're citing our source here.
[1275.84 → 1277.66] They got it up to that level
[1277.66 → 1280.62] and all of a sudden it's worth 33 million,
[1281.06 → 1282.96] which is incredible
[1282.96 → 1285.34] because this could be the beginning of,
[1285.50 → 1286.54] you know, guys like...
[1286.54 → 1289.06] I mean, YouTube hasn't really said,
[1289.18 → 1292.60] okay, yeah, we're going to develop content.
[1292.72 → 1294.02] We're going to hire all the people and do it.
[1294.04 → 1295.28] I don't think they're interested in that.
[1295.36 → 1296.24] They want to be a platform.
[1296.58 → 1299.10] But they've started investing in content creators,
[1299.66 → 1301.04] whether it's Freddie Wong
[1301.04 → 1303.42] or whether it's Awesomeness TV or whoever else,
[1303.42 → 1305.80] to turn their platform into something
[1305.80 → 1308.42] that major studios like DreamWorks
[1309.04 → 1311.24] are going to walk in and buy
[1311.24 → 1313.20] and start being content producers
[1313.20 → 1314.58] on YouTube's platform,
[1314.58 → 1317.46] which makes room for premium channels
[1317.46 → 1319.04] that people will actually legitimately,
[1319.20 → 1320.04] I think, pay for.
[1321.36 → 1321.84] Interesting.
[1322.38 → 1324.18] One thing, like Freddie Wong and stuff,
[1324.24 → 1326.42] it almost sucks that it's named exactly after him
[1326.42 → 1328.20] because for him,
[1328.26 → 1329.20] he probably can't sell it.
[1329.70 → 1330.14] What?
[1330.26 → 1331.08] Or if he did sell it,
[1331.12 → 1332.18] he'd have to stay a part of it.
[1332.52 → 1334.12] But that's what's going on here as well.
[1334.24 → 1335.10] Oh, he's staying a part of it?
[1335.10 → 1336.22] He's staying on board.
[1336.22 → 1338.30] So, hold on.
[1338.38 → 1340.04] Let me just browse down.
[1340.50 → 1344.48] I read this sort of with great interest last night,
[1345.06 → 1348.58] which was, yeah, it kind of blew my mind.
[1348.70 → 1350.78] So he's going to stay on for, I think it was,
[1351.62 → 1352.74] I can't see how long.
[1352.82 → 1354.84] But yeah, so Robbins is staying on
[1354.84 → 1357.56] and he's going to be continuing to develop it
[1357.56 → 1358.30] under DreamWorks.
[1358.32 → 1360.50] Of course, if they're acquiring it for $33 million,
[1360.80 → 1362.98] they probably have some more money earmarked
[1362.98 → 1366.02] to continue to invest in it and make it more awesome.
[1366.42 → 1368.22] But what I figure based on this
[1368.22 → 1369.72] is that I must be a millionaire.
[1374.40 → 1376.34] I'm worth about 4 million views a month
[1376.34 → 1377.22] on Linus Tech Tips.
[1377.32 → 1379.66] So I figure it works out perfectly
[1379.66 → 1382.00] such that you can just extrapolate.
[1382.30 → 1383.02] And so...
[1383.02 → 1383.34] No.
[1383.74 → 1384.56] Yeah, okay.
[1385.10 → 1387.14] I guess our production values aren't really there.
[1387.22 → 1388.66] That's never really been our strength, has it?
[1388.68 → 1389.02] No.
[1389.20 → 1390.32] No, no, I guess it hasn't.
[1390.32 → 1393.96] And like the sale of a tech channel on YouTube
[1393.96 → 1395.24] I don't think is quite as much
[1395.24 → 1397.12] as like an original content creator.
[1397.90 → 1399.42] We create original content...
[1399.42 → 1400.78] Well, about technology.
[1402.44 → 1404.04] Yeah, fair enough, but...
[1404.04 → 1405.20] Not exactly the same platform.
[1405.26 → 1406.70] Either way, the, you know,
[1406.78 → 1409.02] between looking at sort of Netflix's
[1409.02 → 1412.00] constant ebb and flow of their content
[1412.00 → 1413.88] as well as, I mean, this whole thing
[1413.88 → 1417.32] where YouTube channels might turn into TV channels.
[1417.32 → 1420.80] Yeah, I hope that happens as soon as possible.
[1420.96 → 1422.10] Which is just crazy.
[1422.38 → 1422.58] Yeah.
[1422.78 → 1424.12] Which is just absolutely crazy.
[1424.24 → 1425.10] I mean, YouTube's been,
[1425.18 → 1426.48] they've been doing all this stuff.
[1426.90 → 1429.22] I mean, they've been one step ahead.
[1429.78 → 1429.98] Yeah.
[1430.06 → 1431.52] We need to support live.
[1431.74 → 1433.76] We need to support this.
[1433.86 → 1434.98] We need to support that.
[1435.30 → 1438.32] We need to incentivize content creators
[1438.32 → 1440.06] to stay on this platform.
[1440.32 → 1441.98] It's like they support things on like EA.
[1441.98 → 1442.66] Wow.
[1444.94 → 1447.06] Okay, yeah, I guess we're half an hour in.
[1447.18 → 1447.54] I guess it...
[1447.54 → 1448.36] I had to throw a shot at some point.
[1448.36 → 1450.90] It wasn't that early for a shot at EA.
[1453.72 → 1457.26] Speaking of EA, did you put that meme in here?
[1457.90 → 1459.16] No, I can't edit the doc.
[1459.78 → 1460.64] Did you email it to me?
[1461.14 → 1462.24] I think so, at some point.
[1462.34 → 1462.98] Yeah, there it is.
[1463.80 → 1465.54] Okay, so here we go, guys.
[1466.00 → 1468.28] So this was the meme that Slick and I
[1468.28 → 1469.44] were looking for before.
[1469.44 → 1471.44] So it's basically just...
[1472.18 → 1474.54] That's the entire punchline.
[1474.80 → 1476.38] That's all the punchline we need.
[1479.24 → 1481.78] How every joke on their live stream ended
[1481.78 → 1482.90] from now on.
[1485.46 → 1485.86] Yeah.
[1486.76 → 1490.56] And they never sponsored Linus Tech Tips ever.
[1491.72 → 1492.80] Speaking of which, EA,
[1492.94 → 1495.44] if you'd like to sponsor us,
[1496.36 → 1497.16] just get in contact.
[1497.16 → 1497.74] Yeah, go for it.
[1497.74 → 1499.46] Okay, in Germany, apparently YouTube
[1499.46 → 1501.26] created some original channels
[1501.26 → 1502.42] that are paid by YouTube
[1502.42 → 1503.74] to create high-quality content.
[1504.74 → 1505.96] Well, I mean, okay, they had...
[1505.96 → 1506.40] Paid by YouTube.
[1506.62 → 1508.36] Yeah, if they're paid by YouTube
[1508.36 → 1509.54] and they actually hire people
[1509.54 → 1510.62] who actually get a paycheck,
[1510.96 → 1512.28] then that's a little bit different
[1512.28 → 1513.42] from what we've seen over here.
[1513.58 → 1514.64] So there you go.
[1515.66 → 1516.82] Seems I can't watch
[1516.82 → 1518.08] because my sister took the tablet.
[1518.34 → 1518.66] It's okay.
[1518.74 → 1520.76] The archive will go up right away this week.
[1520.82 → 1522.80] We'll be back to the usual way of doing it.
[1522.80 → 1524.98] The problem was that we had to wait
[1524.98 → 1526.44] for Twitch's archive,
[1526.64 → 1527.78] which we could then download
[1527.78 → 1530.06] and chop together in Windows Live Movie Maker.
[1530.44 → 1532.86] And then we had to wait for it to upload.
[1532.98 → 1535.64] And then we had to wait to put in all the timestamps.
[1535.68 → 1537.10] It was just a really, really kludge way
[1537.10 → 1537.76] of doing it before.
[1538.10 → 1539.98] Hopefully it'll actually stay as one this time.
[1540.12 → 1540.68] Hi, Andrew.
[1541.62 → 1543.12] Welcome to watching the live stream.
[1543.48 → 1543.58] Hello.
[1543.58 → 1544.28] Well, live.
[1544.28 → 1547.96] What's your opinion on the Nexus 4?
[1548.52 → 1549.18] I don't know.
[1549.24 → 1550.38] I haven't heard much about it.
[1551.12 → 1554.70] It just seems like it kind of was there
[1554.70 → 1556.26] and people were really excited about it.
[1556.72 → 1558.16] I've heard sales are perfect.
[1559.32 → 1561.62] Like, it's not a huge talking point.
[1562.48 → 1564.94] I mean, it's an Android, stock Android device.
[1564.94 → 1569.34] But honestly, Nexus S also wasn't a huge talking point.
[1569.44 → 1570.18] Lots of people had them.
[1570.46 → 1572.36] Yeah, but it wasn't a huge talking point.
[1572.36 → 1574.44] I think quite a few people have Nexus 4s as well.
[1574.66 → 1575.28] Well, by comparison,
[1575.40 → 1576.78] you look at how much someone like a Samsung
[1576.78 → 1577.70] is spending on marketing.
[1577.70 → 1578.58] Is investing on advertising.
[1578.72 → 1578.92] Yeah.
[1579.22 → 1581.68] So because Samsung is pushing all their phones,
[1581.80 → 1583.88] Google doesn't really do a little bit.
[1584.02 → 1587.10] I think the login page for Gmail now has something about,
[1587.32 → 1589.02] I didn't even look at it, but I saw a phone.
[1589.52 → 1590.46] So maybe they're doing something.
[1590.58 → 1592.74] But like the advertising push behind Samsung
[1592.74 → 1594.76] is so much bigger, making it a talking point.
[1594.86 → 1595.00] Right.
[1595.08 → 1596.86] No, I mean, you have to look at it from Google's perspective.
[1596.98 → 1599.52] It's why are they going to push their hardware platform
[1599.52 → 1602.94] so hard when ultimately it was partners like Samsung
[1602.94 → 1604.62] that made Android a success,
[1605.24 → 1606.70] that were willing to build the hardware
[1606.70 → 1608.34] before Google got around to it.
[1608.42 → 1608.54] Yeah.
[1610.34 → 1612.60] So, yeah, I mean, and the other thing too, though,
[1612.60 → 1614.56] is with faster, more modern devices
[1614.56 → 1618.18] like the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4
[1618.18 → 1620.58] hitting the market, being available now.
[1620.58 → 1624.06] There is a unique experience with Nexus devices, though.
[1624.22 → 1624.48] Okay.
[1624.62 → 1625.88] I brought this up with my Nexus S.
[1625.94 → 1628.74] I went through three major platform changes with that phone.
[1629.24 → 1630.18] Like that was crazy.
[1630.54 → 1632.60] And like right when it's announced as released,
[1633.36 → 1634.14] it's on my phone.
[1634.38 → 1634.58] Right.
[1634.70 → 1635.98] Like that's one thing with the Nexus phones.
[1636.04 → 1637.04] You always get the updates
[1637.04 → 1638.24] because you're getting pushed from Google,
[1638.90 → 1640.38] which is kind of fantastic.
[1641.26 → 1643.96] Just that like awesome support that you expect
[1643.96 → 1646.12] from directly being attached to Google.
[1646.42 → 1646.68] Right.
[1648.12 → 1649.50] Let's talk about this.
[1649.50 → 1653.34] So Racer has launched their Comm software.
[1653.86 → 1655.00] It's in beta right now.
[1655.36 → 1656.88] I tried to install it,
[1657.06 → 1659.28] and it basically just kind of closed.
[1659.40 → 1660.56] So I kind of gave up
[1660.56 → 1661.90] because I was going to test it with Slick.
[1662.32 → 1665.16] But what I discovered is that when I reinstalled,
[1665.24 → 1666.32] it might have been a problem actually
[1666.32 → 1667.42] with my audio drivers.
[1667.98 → 1671.04] I updated the firmware on my S1 and the drivers,
[1671.34 → 1673.14] and everything's working 100% now.
[1673.52 → 1675.32] So it might not have been Comm's problem.
[1675.32 → 1676.96] But I haven't tried it yet personally,
[1677.14 → 1679.10] but I sent the link over to Slick.
[1679.10 → 1681.44] So what are they trying to do here exactly?
[1682.78 → 1684.36] I think they're trying to replace Skype
[1684.36 → 1687.26] because the interface style,
[1687.66 → 1689.00] like you know there's the like
[1689.00 → 1691.56] ventral team speak kind of style
[1691.56 → 1692.54] where there's a server,
[1693.08 → 1694.56] and you join and disconnect from the server,
[1694.70 → 1696.42] and there's chat rooms and all that kind of stuff.
[1696.60 → 1696.68] Yeah.
[1696.74 → 1697.90] It's not set up like that.
[1698.24 → 1698.50] Right.
[1698.64 → 1699.92] Which is why a lot of gamers
[1699.92 → 1701.06] have started using Skype
[1701.06 → 1703.62] instead of the complicated setup
[1703.62 → 1704.76] that goes into that stuff.
[1704.76 → 1706.38] Which honestly I still kind of like.
[1706.38 → 1707.66] I like Mumble.
[1707.88 → 1708.66] I love Mumble.
[1708.98 → 1709.48] I'm a Mumble guy.
[1709.48 → 1710.82] Mumble's the same kind of thing though.
[1710.90 → 1711.04] Yeah.
[1711.12 → 1711.84] Same kind of thing.
[1712.62 → 1712.98] Oh.
[1714.12 → 1714.48] Right.
[1714.84 → 1715.96] We have something else to talk about.
[1716.08 → 1717.58] But I will continue this topic until we're done.
[1717.66 → 1717.84] Sorry.
[1718.02 → 1719.90] Just Mod Chat reminded me
[1719.90 → 1721.82] about a serious thing going on.
[1724.00 → 1725.00] Sorry for that segue.
[1725.12 → 1725.64] I'll come back.
[1725.64 → 1728.00] So it has the social pane
[1728.00 → 1729.72] just like Skype does
[1729.72 → 1731.34] where it shows everyone on your friends list.
[1731.74 → 1732.62] So on the left side.
[1732.78 → 1733.82] I'm looking on his.
[1734.34 → 1736.28] Everyone on your friends list on the left side.
[1736.86 → 1739.68] And then you can open up chat groups
[1739.68 → 1740.94] super, super easily
[1740.94 → 1742.78] and you can save those chat groups.
[1742.94 → 1744.52] So you can kind of make channels.
[1745.12 → 1745.58] Kind of.
[1745.70 → 1746.08] Kind of.
[1746.08 → 1746.94] Because you can save chat groups.
[1747.10 → 1747.26] Okay.
[1747.38 → 1749.48] So if you have liked your team for whatever game
[1749.48 → 1752.24] you can save them all as a chat group.
[1752.56 → 1753.58] Are we streaming this page?
[1753.68 → 1753.78] Yeah.
[1753.78 → 1753.86] Okay.
[1754.36 → 1755.32] So let's see.
[1755.44 → 1756.06] Team Diablo.
[1756.40 → 1756.58] Yeah.
[1756.68 → 1758.04] So he's got a chat group going on.
[1758.10 → 1759.46] Apparently there's a channel within there.
[1759.52 → 1760.50] I haven't used it enough.
[1760.60 → 1761.24] I'm sorry guys.
[1761.46 → 1762.50] I guess you can maybe
[1762.50 → 1763.96] within individual chat groups
[1763.96 → 1764.58] make channels.
[1764.80 → 1765.50] It's kind of interesting.
[1766.02 → 1768.12] So that's a cool option to do there.
[1769.62 → 1771.86] For like general feedback on its performance.
[1772.28 → 1773.70] Its auto-detected settings
[1773.70 → 1776.20] I'm finding are not quite as good as Skype.
[1776.62 → 1777.12] With Skype
[1777.12 → 1779.24] as far as I can tell
[1779.24 → 1781.22] anyone just clicks call and it works.
[1781.70 → 1781.76] Right.
[1781.76 → 1783.82] Like as long as you have the right device
[1783.82 → 1784.62] pointing at it and stuff
[1784.62 → 1785.38] it just works.
[1787.58 → 1787.98] With
[1787.98 → 1788.88] what is it?
[1789.12 → 1789.52] Come?
[1789.68 → 1789.88] Yeah.
[1790.24 → 1791.22] Used it for a while.
[1791.34 → 1793.08] I think we had up to six people on it
[1793.08 → 1794.46] and all we noticed
[1794.46 → 1796.46] is that maybe you had to turn
[1796.46 → 1797.28] one dude up.
[1797.90 → 1798.16] Okay.
[1798.16 → 1799.32] Or maybe you had to slightly turn
[1799.32 → 1800.44] your own mic down or up.
[1800.58 → 1801.46] But it wasn't like
[1801.46 → 1804.72] it wasn't crazy hardcore settings.
[1805.06 → 1805.36] It was
[1805.36 → 1806.64] up or down.
[1806.64 → 1806.76] Slider.
[1806.90 → 1807.54] One slider.
[1807.80 → 1808.00] Okay.
[1808.34 → 1809.38] Not a big deal.
[1809.62 → 1810.78] Anyone can do this setup
[1810.78 → 1812.02] fairly easy level settings.
[1812.36 → 1813.60] Like I had a fan in my room
[1813.60 → 1814.52] pointed directly
[1814.52 → 1815.78] at a desktop mic.
[1816.12 → 1817.72] So you would expect it to pick it up.
[1817.94 → 1818.76] And it was a little bit
[1818.76 → 1819.78] but it doesn't in Skype.
[1820.56 → 1821.50] But then I just turned
[1821.50 → 1822.32] the slider down
[1822.32 → 1823.14] a little bit
[1823.14 → 1824.38] and it was totally fine.
[1824.72 → 1825.14] I see.
[1825.28 → 1826.14] So the auto-detect
[1826.14 → 1827.74] isn't quite as awesome as Skype
[1827.74 → 1829.16] but it's super, super easy
[1829.16 → 1830.34] to tune in.
[1830.36 → 1830.92] So that's awesome.
[1831.48 → 1832.34] One big problem
[1832.34 → 1833.24] that a lot of Skype users
[1833.24 → 1834.32] especially myself
[1834.32 → 1835.28] hate
[1835.28 → 1837.20] is that if we're in a game
[1837.20 → 1838.24] and someone calls you
[1838.24 → 1841.84] like the crazy annoying call
[1841.84 → 1841.86] Yeah.
[1841.86 → 1842.86] It's so loud.
[1842.94 → 1844.24] It's insanely loud
[1844.24 → 1845.32] and it will probably
[1845.32 → 1846.44] put an overlay on your screen
[1846.44 → 1847.30] or it'll tab you
[1847.30 → 1847.94] out of your game.
[1848.46 → 1848.56] Right.
[1848.56 → 1849.12] And like if someone
[1849.12 → 1850.16] hangs up the call
[1850.16 → 1851.46] you might get tabbed
[1851.46 → 1852.12] out of your game
[1852.12 → 1853.22] and your whole call
[1853.22 → 1854.22] ends if it's the person
[1854.22 → 1855.08] who started the call.
[1855.42 → 1856.28] And like there's all these
[1856.28 → 1857.44] kind of major problems.
[1857.70 → 1858.34] This one
[1858.34 → 1859.60] it will now transfer the host.
[1859.60 → 1861.32] Oh that's cool.
[1861.48 → 1861.98] We think.
[1863.86 → 1864.84] We tried it
[1864.84 → 1866.20] and then a really, really loud
[1866.20 → 1867.54] high-pitched noise came in
[1867.54 → 1868.32] and then everyone
[1868.32 → 1869.06] could hear each other
[1869.06 → 1870.38] but it was kind of crackly.
[1870.58 → 1871.94] Okay, but it is in beta I guess.
[1872.32 → 1872.92] It is in beta.
[1873.28 → 1874.68] That's one big takeaway
[1874.68 → 1875.56] people need to understand
[1875.56 → 1876.20] it is in beta.
[1876.36 → 1876.66] Beta.
[1877.16 → 1878.04] And that's not like
[1878.04 → 1879.52] the audio codec or anything.
[1880.32 → 1881.04] Right okay.
[1881.18 → 1882.70] Might just deal with that for now
[1882.70 → 1883.70] it'll hopefully be fixed.
[1884.78 → 1885.86] So I think it's supposed
[1885.86 → 1886.56] to transfer the host
[1886.56 → 1887.00] in the call.
[1887.00 → 1889.58] If you get a call
[1889.58 → 1891.08] you don't really get a call
[1891.08 → 1892.36] in a game.
[1892.38 → 1893.32] If you get a call in a game
[1893.32 → 1894.16] it'll come up in the bottom
[1894.16 → 1894.76] right-hand corner.
[1895.16 → 1896.22] It will not tab you out.
[1896.48 → 1897.64] It'll pop up like a steam
[1897.64 → 1898.74] or fire overlay.
[1899.04 → 1899.22] Okay.
[1899.34 → 1900.08] If anyone knows about that.
[1900.26 → 1901.22] It has a key command
[1901.22 → 1902.44] just like steam or fire
[1902.44 → 1903.64] so you can bind it to
[1903.64 → 1904.54] I think whatever you want
[1904.54 → 1906.00] but it's a control tab.
[1907.26 → 1907.54] Okay.
[1907.86 → 1908.00] Sure.
[1908.24 → 1909.40] Which still kind of sucks
[1909.40 → 1910.18] because crouching
[1910.18 → 1911.36] and then checking your score.
[1911.60 → 1911.82] Right.
[1912.02 → 1912.98] But you could change it to
[1912.98 → 1913.72] But I think
[1913.72 → 1915.46] 99% sure you can change it
[1915.46 → 1915.84] I don't know why
[1915.84 → 1916.44] you wouldn't be able to.
[1916.66 → 1917.78] I haven't changed it yet
[1917.78 → 1918.32] but I will.
[1919.30 → 1920.36] So that's kind of nice.
[1920.60 → 1921.74] Very unobtrusive
[1921.74 → 1922.80] while you're in games
[1922.80 → 1924.14] which is Skype's problem.
[1924.36 → 1924.60] Right.
[1924.78 → 1925.34] And then the audio
[1925.34 → 1926.18] is not quite as good
[1926.18 → 1927.08] but after a few seconds
[1927.08 → 1927.76] you can get there.
[1928.06 → 1928.08] So.
[1928.56 → 1928.84] Okay.
[1929.06 → 1929.56] So what do you think?
[1929.56 → 1930.80] I actually like it a lot so far.
[1930.88 → 1931.44] Some hype for this.
[1931.46 → 1932.16] I think I'm going to
[1932.16 → 1933.14] kind of make the jump.
[1933.30 → 1933.60] Really?
[1933.74 → 1934.64] I've been using Skype forever.
[1934.74 → 1935.74] I'm still going to use Skype
[1935.74 → 1937.86] for text chat
[1937.86 → 1938.52] for a lot of people
[1938.52 → 1939.76] just because I have more people
[1939.76 → 1940.24] on Skype.
[1940.58 → 1940.94] Right.
[1940.94 → 1944.78] But yeah
[1944.78 → 1945.90] for comes in games
[1945.90 → 1947.06] I hate Skype
[1947.06 → 1947.74] it pisses me off
[1947.74 → 1948.26] because it constantly
[1948.26 → 1948.96] tabs me out
[1948.96 → 1949.56] and just
[1949.56 → 1951.40] is a massive annoyance.
[1951.80 → 1952.30] So I've
[1952.30 → 1952.90] So what's the impression?
[1952.94 → 1954.14] You said you had six people on
[1954.14 → 1954.50] but what is it?
[1955.48 → 1956.60] Everyone's kind of down with it.
[1956.98 → 1957.92] We've tried a lot of
[1957.92 → 1958.72] different voice chats
[1958.72 → 1960.12] most of the guys
[1960.12 → 1961.42] most of the guys
[1961.42 → 1962.28] that haven't been gaming
[1962.28 → 1963.10] as long as say
[1963.10 → 1964.06] like my brother and I
[1964.06 → 1965.88] like the Skype style
[1965.88 → 1966.88] where it's a friends list
[1966.88 → 1967.18] Yeah.
[1967.18 → 1968.12] more than the old
[1968.12 → 1968.88] channel based
[1968.88 → 1970.58] vent kind of style.
[1970.72 → 1970.94] Right.
[1971.64 → 1972.94] So we've been using Skype
[1972.94 → 1973.42] for a while
[1973.42 → 1974.42] but none of us
[1974.42 → 1975.90] have been totally satisfied
[1975.90 → 1976.50] because of it
[1976.50 → 1977.52] tabbing it out of games
[1977.52 → 1977.74] and stuff.
[1977.80 → 1977.90] Right.
[1977.90 → 1978.28] So we've been looking
[1978.28 → 1978.94] for a different solution
[1978.94 → 1979.70] but there hasn't really
[1979.70 → 1980.68] been one quite as good.
[1981.22 → 1982.74] So usually
[1982.74 → 1983.72] we'll all download
[1983.72 → 1984.28] the new thing
[1984.28 → 1984.92] that comes out
[1984.92 → 1985.94] try it for a little bit
[1985.94 → 1986.50] and everyone bails
[1986.50 → 1987.28] and goes back to Skype.
[1987.64 → 1988.26] Everyone's actually
[1988.26 → 1989.62] been consistently using comes
[1989.62 → 1990.56] since we downloaded it.
[1990.56 → 1991.06] So I wonder
[1991.06 → 1991.80] what's the benefit
[1991.80 → 1992.42] to Racer
[1992.42 → 1993.30] to create this?
[1996.56 → 1997.04] Branding.
[1997.18 → 1997.50] I guess.
[1997.58 → 1998.24] I think they're doing
[1998.24 → 1998.94] ads on it.
[1999.54 → 1999.88] Okay.
[2000.10 → 2001.58] So there's that.
[2001.66 → 2001.80] Yeah.
[2001.92 → 2002.58] Price free.
[2003.24 → 2003.52] Yeah.
[2003.66 → 2003.98] Is apparently
[2003.98 → 2005.02] their intention.
[2005.84 → 2006.22] I mean
[2006.22 → 2006.96] you know
[2006.96 → 2008.92] but their branding's
[2008.92 → 2009.70] all over it.
[2009.96 → 2010.84] So if you're using
[2010.84 → 2012.30] comes for all your games
[2012.30 → 2013.66] and you go to a store
[2013.66 → 2014.26] and you're
[2014.26 → 2015.06] if you're just
[2015.06 → 2015.76] getting into gaming
[2015.76 → 2016.54] and your buddy
[2016.54 → 2017.22] who's been into gaming
[2017.22 → 2017.76] forever is like
[2017.76 → 2018.22] yeah I download
[2018.22 → 2019.36] this Racer comes thing
[2019.36 → 2020.38] and then you get
[2020.38 → 2021.26] into gaming a little bit more
[2021.26 → 2021.68] and you want to buy
[2021.68 → 2022.20] some peripherals
[2022.20 → 2022.94] and you go to the store
[2022.94 → 2024.52] if you see Racer
[2024.52 → 2025.06] on the shelf
[2025.06 → 2025.84] what are you going to think?
[2025.92 → 2026.40] You're probably going to
[2026.40 → 2027.08] want to buy the Racer
[2027.08 → 2027.22] something.
[2027.88 → 2028.62] So you think that's
[2028.62 → 2029.70] probably their intention then?
[2029.88 → 2030.58] Yeah and I think
[2030.58 → 2031.48] they're doing some ads.
[2031.72 → 2032.24] Some ads.
[2032.40 → 2032.60] Okay.
[2033.24 → 2034.18] I mean if they run ads
[2034.18 → 2035.54] for the hot new game
[2035.54 → 2036.16] or whatever else
[2036.16 → 2036.86] I think they have
[2036.86 → 2037.72] enough relationships
[2037.72 → 2038.54] with developers
[2038.54 → 2039.34] as it is.
[2039.42 → 2039.82] I mean you look at
[2039.82 → 2040.34] even the branded
[2040.34 → 2041.20] peripherals they do.
[2041.76 → 2042.48] Someone will run
[2042.48 → 2043.42] advertising with them
[2043.42 → 2044.02] if they can get
[2044.02 → 2044.26] the user base.
[2044.26 → 2044.78] I don't think
[2044.78 → 2045.38] they'll have a problem
[2045.38 → 2046.10] with getting ads.
[2046.48 → 2046.58] So.
[2047.12 → 2048.10] I'm not 100% sure
[2048.10 → 2048.72] about the ads' thing
[2048.72 → 2049.88] but I think I remember.
[2049.90 → 2050.28] Very cool.
[2050.40 → 2051.54] So there you go guys.
[2051.64 → 2052.58] Racer comes.
[2053.04 → 2053.72] Check it out.
[2053.88 → 2054.50] I think it's
[2054.50 → 2056.24] razorzone.com
[2056.24 → 2056.90] slash
[2056.90 → 2058.18] or razorzone.com
[2058.18 → 2060.76] slash whatever your region is
[2060.76 → 2061.72] slash comes
[2061.72 → 2062.90] or something like that.
[2062.96 → 2063.30] So there you go.
[2063.34 → 2064.32] That's what the page looks like.
[2064.38 → 2065.42] If you google razor comes
[2065.42 → 2066.30] then that'll come up for sure.
[2066.30 → 2068.24] I didn't expect it to be that good
[2068.24 → 2069.52] especially after you said
[2069.52 → 2070.54] it just completely crashed.
[2070.90 → 2071.16] Yeah.
[2071.32 → 2071.78] I was like
[2071.78 → 2072.40] ah whatever
[2072.40 → 2073.20] I'll test this out
[2073.20 → 2073.68] and me and a buddy
[2073.68 → 2074.14] jumped on
[2074.14 → 2074.50] and then it
[2074.50 → 2075.94] was a pleasant surprise
[2075.94 → 2076.66] so that was cool.
[2078.98 → 2079.34] Okay.
[2079.72 → 2080.00] So.
[2081.06 → 2081.40] Oh yeah.
[2081.40 → 2081.70] Apparently.
[2082.16 → 2082.62] What's going on?
[2083.00 → 2083.36] Apparently
[2083.36 → 2086.22] EA shut down
[2086.22 → 2086.88] Pop Cap
[2086.88 → 2087.68] Vancouver.
[2088.50 → 2088.92] Oh really?
[2089.08 → 2089.48] I don't remember
[2089.48 → 2090.16] when they did this
[2090.16 → 2090.70] but they did it
[2090.70 → 2091.68] during something else.
[2091.84 → 2092.30] Oh okay.
[2092.80 → 2093.92] So that it wasn't
[2093.92 → 2094.90] like a major news item.
[2094.90 → 2096.44] I don't know if they planned that.
[2096.50 → 2097.38] They probably didn't plan that
[2097.38 → 2097.98] but it happened
[2097.98 → 2098.80] during something else
[2098.80 → 2099.54] big going on.
[2099.90 → 2100.80] I don't know if it was
[2100.80 → 2102.20] the Boston bombing
[2102.20 → 2102.72] or something
[2102.72 → 2103.36] but it was like
[2103.36 → 2104.40] something huge
[2104.40 → 2105.06] was going on
[2105.06 → 2106.02] and they shut down
[2106.02 → 2106.90] Pop Cap Vancouver
[2106.90 → 2107.96] and laid off
[2107.96 → 2109.14] 2,000 employees.
[2110.22 → 2110.66] Wow.
[2110.90 → 2111.54] And they're planning
[2111.54 → 2113.16] a complete company restructure.
[2113.62 → 2114.26] So their plan
[2114.26 → 2115.36] to win the hearts back
[2115.36 → 2115.98] of the community
[2115.98 → 2116.84] was to fire
[2116.84 → 2117.94] 2,000 people.
[2119.18 → 2119.96] Which is probably
[2119.96 → 2121.52] I don't know.
[2121.86 → 2122.14] Well yeah.
[2122.28 → 2122.80] So here we go.
[2122.88 → 2123.70] Electronic Arts.
[2123.70 → 2125.04] This is on Tech Vibes
[2125.04 → 2126.00] that I'm on right now.
[2126.40 → 2127.22] Electronic Arts
[2127.22 → 2128.26] Shuttering Pop Cap
[2128.26 → 2129.70] and Quicklime Studios
[2129.70 → 2130.68] in Vancouver
[2130.68 → 2131.56] sources say.
[2131.74 → 2132.26] So this was
[2132.26 → 2133.50] yeah on the 25th of April.
[2134.24 → 2134.36] Yeah.
[2136.16 → 2137.10] Electronic Arts
[2137.10 → 2137.46] dubbed
[2137.46 → 2138.06] and here's a quote
[2138.06 → 2139.72] from again Tech Vibes
[2139.72 → 2140.48] Electronic Arts
[2140.48 → 2140.98] dubbed the
[2140.98 → 2142.52] the worst company in America
[2142.52 → 2144.04] in both 2012 and 2013
[2144.04 → 2145.64] laid off 170 people
[2145.64 → 2146.68] in Montreal
[2146.68 → 2147.70] on April 11th
[2148.32 → 2149.14] followed by
[2149.14 → 2150.20] this layoff
[2150.20 → 2151.54] which is
[2151.54 → 2152.76] let's see if I can get
[2152.76 → 2153.82] an exact number here.
[2154.94 → 2155.82] Internal memo
[2155.82 → 2156.56] something about
[2156.56 → 2157.38] a restructuring.
[2157.58 → 2157.96] Wow.
[2159.92 → 2160.40] Wow.
[2160.46 → 2161.06] That's terrible.
[2162.64 → 2163.34] I mean how much
[2163.34 → 2166.72] how could
[2166.72 → 2168.06] they have taken
[2168.06 → 2169.24] something like Pop Cap
[2169.24 → 2170.48] and gotten it
[2170.48 → 2170.86] to the point
[2170.86 → 2171.40] where they have to
[2171.40 → 2172.32] lay off a whole team?
[2173.04 → 2173.58] I mean Pop Cap
[2173.58 → 2174.74] was rolling in money.
[2176.34 → 2177.30] EA's perfect
[2177.30 → 2178.04] at killing things.
[2178.04 → 2178.96] Wow.
[2181.82 → 2183.24] I mean I feel terrible
[2183.24 → 2183.84] for the people
[2183.84 → 2184.76] who were working
[2184.76 → 2186.08] for doing something
[2186.08 → 2186.96] that was
[2186.96 → 2187.22] you know
[2187.22 → 2188.32] successful and awesome
[2188.32 → 2189.68] and then
[2189.68 → 2190.64] you know
[2190.64 → 2191.42] in order for EA
[2191.42 → 2192.40] to have a clean start
[2192.40 → 2193.10] in 2014
[2193.10 → 2196.46] So in 2011
[2196.46 → 2197.48] EA bought
[2197.48 → 2198.36] Pop Cap
[2198.36 → 2200.02] for 1.3 billion dollars
[2200.02 → 2203.22] and they've
[2203.22 → 2203.68] they made
[2203.68 → 2204.96] Plants vs. Zombies
[2204.96 → 2205.44] and
[2205.44 → 2206.82] Bejewelled Blitz
[2206.82 → 2207.86] like those are two
[2207.86 → 2209.50] huge games.
[2209.90 → 2210.20] Yeah I mean
[2210.20 → 2211.50] merchandising alone
[2211.50 → 2212.72] they should be able
[2212.72 → 2213.56] to keep these people
[2213.56 → 2214.04] employed.
[2214.96 → 2215.64] Sell some more
[2215.64 → 2216.40] zombie plushes.
[2216.40 → 2216.96] Like the amount
[2216.96 → 2217.96] of freaking zombie
[2217.96 → 2218.80] plushes and like
[2218.80 → 2219.58] walnut hats
[2219.58 → 2220.60] that I saw at PAX
[2220.60 → 2221.20] for a little while
[2221.20 → 2222.40] there was insane.
[2223.52 → 2223.98] Like everybody
[2223.98 → 2224.64] had a little
[2224.64 → 2225.52] walnut thing.
[2226.06 → 2226.82] Yeah this is like
[2226.82 → 2227.90] terrible news, actually.
[2228.08 → 2228.36] Yeah.
[2229.50 → 2230.44] It's never good
[2230.44 → 2231.20] to see like
[2231.20 → 2232.04] buckets of people
[2232.04 → 2232.58] laid off.
[2233.26 → 2233.74] And it seems like
[2233.74 → 2234.48] every single time
[2234.48 → 2235.12] you hear of layoffs
[2235.12 → 2235.90] in the gaming industry
[2235.90 → 2236.52] it's like yeah
[2236.52 → 2238.34] EA just laid off
[2238.34 → 2239.80] like quadruple figure
[2239.80 → 2241.18] Yeah EA acquired
[2241.18 → 2241.76] something
[2241.76 → 2243.28] and then ran it
[2243.28 → 2243.94] into the ground
[2243.94 → 2244.64] and just fired
[2244.64 → 2244.98] everyone
[2244.98 → 2245.56] and laid off
[2245.56 → 2246.00] everyone.
[2247.00 → 2247.24] Like
[2247.24 → 2247.76] oh.
[2250.58 → 2251.78] So there's the
[2251.78 → 2253.08] uplifting story
[2253.08 → 2253.58] of the week
[2253.58 → 2253.98] I guess.
[2254.24 → 2255.14] Yeah that's terrible.
[2257.78 → 2258.22] Um
[2258.22 → 2260.62] I don't know.
[2260.94 → 2261.74] So that's no good.
[2261.88 → 2262.64] Let's get a new item
[2262.64 → 2263.32] so we can be happy.
[2263.32 → 2264.20] Yeah I have like
[2264.20 → 2265.40] nothing to say anymore.
[2265.56 → 2266.04] That's just
[2266.04 → 2267.68] really crappy.
[2267.84 → 2268.70] And like we're not even
[2268.70 → 2270.50] that fast on the upkeep
[2270.50 → 2271.10] like that was a little
[2271.10 → 2271.62] while ago.
[2271.76 → 2272.54] Yeah that was a couple
[2272.54 → 2273.08] weeks back.
[2273.30 → 2273.46] Yeah.
[2274.06 → 2274.96] Or a little week in a bit.
[2274.98 → 2275.86] Still totally crappy.
[2275.98 → 2276.80] Yeah it's still crappy.
[2276.98 → 2277.84] We just heard about it
[2277.84 → 2278.74] so it's crappy to us
[2278.74 → 2279.10] at least.
[2279.20 → 2279.88] I'm sure it's still
[2279.88 → 2281.08] crappy to the uh
[2281.08 → 2283.30] yeah okay well
[2283.30 → 2284.26] James makes a good point.
[2284.26 → 2285.42] But Pop Cap made
[2285.42 → 2286.00] things for
[2286.00 → 2287.04] tablets
[2287.04 → 2288.24] and phones
[2288.24 → 2288.84] and stuff.
[2288.84 → 2289.60] PCs and
[2289.60 → 2290.88] every platform.
[2291.10 → 2292.32] Yeah there's actually
[2292.32 → 2293.76] I can't think of a
[2293.76 → 2294.42] compelling reason.
[2294.54 → 2294.92] It's not like
[2294.92 → 2296.16] Android's going somewhere.
[2297.30 → 2298.58] Except like this.
[2298.90 → 2299.12] Yeah.
[2299.60 → 2299.80] Yeah.
[2299.94 → 2300.50] Yeah if anything
[2300.50 → 2301.20] there should be more
[2301.20 → 2302.22] opportunities for
[2302.22 → 2303.52] yeah.
[2303.94 → 2304.90] Apparently there's
[2304.90 → 2306.24] the goal for comes
[2306.24 → 2306.92] is to have only
[2306.92 → 2307.70] one ad
[2307.70 → 2309.08] and it's a
[2309.08 → 2309.82] banner at the
[2309.82 → 2310.34] bottom.
[2310.68 → 2311.16] I'm getting this
[2311.16 → 2312.14] from my moderator chat.
[2312.14 → 2313.42] So they'll have one ad
[2313.42 → 2314.20] that'll probably be a
[2314.20 → 2315.50] really high value ad.
[2315.80 → 2316.00] Right.
[2316.06 → 2316.70] And it's probably just
[2316.70 → 2317.12] going to chill at
[2317.12 → 2317.38] bottom.
[2317.64 → 2318.94] Again probably won't
[2318.94 → 2319.46] be obtrusive.
[2319.96 → 2320.28] Cool.
[2320.66 → 2321.34] Probably be fine.
[2321.46 → 2322.12] Yeah that's outstanding.
[2323.04 → 2325.06] So what a 690 or a
[2325.06 → 2326.20] 7990 be bottlenecked
[2326.20 → 2327.78] by an i53570k
[2327.78 → 2328.76] overclocked to 4.2.
[2329.18 → 2330.02] It doesn't really
[2330.02 → 2331.26] matter because
[2331.26 → 2333.74] an i53570k
[2333.74 → 2334.70] right now
[2334.70 → 2335.68] I mean who knows
[2335.68 → 2336.20] how things are going
[2336.20 → 2336.84] to change over the
[2336.84 → 2337.54] next month or so
[2337.54 → 2339.50] right now is as fast
[2339.50 → 2339.98] as you can get
[2339.98 → 2340.36] anyway.
[2340.36 → 2342.62] So sure
[2342.62 → 2343.42] maybe it's bottlenecked
[2343.42 → 2343.76] I don't know
[2343.76 → 2344.20] what do you want me
[2344.20 → 2344.70] to tell you?
[2345.14 → 2346.08] It's as not
[2346.08 → 2346.80] bottlenecked as it
[2346.80 → 2347.28] can be.
[2347.72 → 2348.74] Every system
[2348.74 → 2349.68] everywhere
[2349.68 → 2351.04] the one you're
[2351.04 → 2352.00] sitting in front of
[2352.00 → 2353.16] the one that you
[2353.16 → 2354.14] used before that
[2354.14 → 2355.10] the one that's in
[2355.10 → 2355.98] your parents room
[2355.98 → 2357.46] every system has a
[2357.46 → 2357.90] bottleneck
[2357.90 → 2358.62] somewhere.
[2359.22 → 2359.76] It's like people
[2359.76 → 2360.70] ask me is this
[2360.70 → 2361.50] system bottlenecked?
[2361.62 → 2361.84] Yes.
[2362.26 → 2363.08] Every system is
[2363.08 → 2363.58] bottlenecked.
[2363.80 → 2364.98] It's about reducing
[2364.98 → 2366.46] bottlenecks and making
[2366.46 → 2367.98] them not as narrow
[2367.98 → 2368.76] as possible.
[2368.76 → 2369.88] So for example
[2369.88 → 2370.98] a system
[2370.98 → 2372.78] with a 6 core
[2372.78 → 2373.32] processor
[2373.32 → 2374.68] and a GTX
[2374.68 → 2375.10] Titan
[2375.10 → 2376.72] is bottlenecked
[2376.72 → 2378.46] in every situation
[2378.46 → 2379.16] is bottlenecked
[2379.16 → 2379.60] by something.
[2379.70 → 2380.18] Your system
[2380.18 → 2381.14] can only be as
[2381.14 → 2382.36] fast as the
[2382.36 → 2383.54] the slowest component
[2383.54 → 2385.32] and some component
[2385.32 → 2386.56] will always be
[2386.56 → 2387.72] the slowest thing
[2387.72 → 2388.86] for any given
[2388.86 → 2389.32] workload.
[2389.44 → 2389.98] That's just how
[2389.98 → 2390.52] it works.
[2391.16 → 2392.14] So yes.
[2392.74 → 2393.06] Yes.
[2393.80 → 2394.90] It will not be
[2394.90 → 2395.78] bottlenecked any more
[2395.78 → 2396.20] than it would
[2396.20 → 2397.34] otherwise have to be.
[2397.34 → 2398.56] The only way to
[2398.56 → 2399.56] reduce that bottleneck
[2399.56 → 2400.58] will be to overclock
[2400.58 → 2402.38] that 3570K even
[2402.38 → 2402.70] further.
[2404.10 → 2404.96] So there.
[2405.84 → 2406.60] What's in yours and
[2406.60 → 2407.58] Slick's personal rigs?
[2407.76 → 2408.66] Well I'm running a
[2408.66 → 2409.82] 3970X.
[2410.02 → 2411.08] I'm running a
[2411.08 → 2412.16] GTX 590.
[2412.54 → 2414.00] I've got 8 gigs of
[2414.00 → 2414.68] RAM in there right
[2414.68 → 2415.48] now because my
[2415.48 → 2416.66] memory has been
[2416.66 → 2417.08] borrowed.
[2419.48 → 2420.62] It's coming back soon.
[2420.68 → 2421.12] For a while.
[2421.22 → 2422.88] I've got 8 120 gig
[2422.88 → 2424.50] SSDs in a RAID 0
[2424.50 → 2425.62] array that I back up
[2425.62 → 2427.12] nightly because that's
[2427.12 → 2427.68] insane.
[2428.08 → 2428.80] I have an XFX
[2428.80 → 2430.36] 1000 watt 80 plus
[2430.36 → 2431.48] platinum power supply
[2431.48 → 2433.12] and custom liquid
[2433.12 → 2433.38] cooling.
[2433.68 → 2433.92] Go.
[2434.84 → 2435.12] I don't.
[2435.60 → 2435.92] Oh.
[2436.84 → 2437.90] I have to do things
[2437.90 → 2438.68] to mine first.
[2439.02 → 2439.26] No.
[2439.34 → 2439.48] No.
[2439.54 → 2439.94] Tell them what you
[2439.94 → 2440.28] have now.
[2440.50 → 2441.54] I have a 2600K and
[2441.54 → 2443.22] a 660 Ti with an
[2443.22 → 2444.34] N-Check 1200 watt
[2444.34 → 2445.24] true power which is
[2445.24 → 2446.30] like massively.
[2446.68 → 2447.38] Actually beast.
[2447.84 → 2449.76] Absurdly overkill and
[2449.76 → 2450.74] beast and unnecessary.
[2450.74 → 2453.48] An Octane 256 gigabyte
[2453.48 → 2455.16] SSD which doesn't
[2455.16 → 2455.62] back up.
[2456.76 → 2457.86] Do you really not have
[2457.86 → 2458.96] it set up to back up?
[2459.00 → 2459.62] It's just programming.
[2459.98 → 2460.30] Oh.
[2460.70 → 2461.50] I don't store any
[2461.50 → 2462.26] documents on there at
[2462.26 → 2462.38] all.
[2462.78 → 2463.24] Oh okay.
[2463.36 → 2464.04] It's just programming.
[2464.14 → 2464.94] Like I could reset up
[2464.94 → 2466.24] that SSD in an hour or
[2466.24 → 2466.36] two.
[2466.64 → 2466.92] Okay.
[2467.16 → 2467.78] So I don't bother.
[2467.78 → 2471.40] And then a like big
[2471.40 → 2472.56] two terabyte drive which
[2472.56 → 2473.96] I do back up that has
[2473.96 → 2475.98] all my games which I
[2475.98 → 2476.62] don't need to back up
[2476.62 → 2477.34] so I don't back up that
[2477.34 → 2477.66] folder.
[2478.04 → 2478.68] But then like all my
[2478.68 → 2479.62] documents and videos and
[2479.62 → 2480.38] music and everything else
[2480.38 → 2480.76] on there.
[2481.38 → 2481.92] What am I missing?
[2482.00 → 2482.90] 12 gigs of kind of
[2482.90 → 2484.02] mixed matched RAM.
[2484.32 → 2485.20] Half of its Dominators.
[2485.36 → 2486.06] Half of it's like.
[2487.56 → 2488.46] Do you still have that
[2488.46 → 2489.12] Anton stuff?
[2489.12 → 2489.38] Yep.
[2489.48 → 2490.26] Half of it's Anton.
[2490.38 → 2490.74] Nice.
[2490.88 → 2491.66] Kimono went out of
[2491.66 → 2493.62] business years ago.
[2493.76 → 2495.58] That was like four years
[2495.58 → 2495.90] ago.
[2496.44 → 2496.80] Yep.
[2496.80 → 2498.42] It's like Anton RAM like
[2498.42 → 2499.08] a boss.
[2499.18 → 2500.06] Totally awesome.
[2500.12 → 2501.04] That was such a good
[2501.04 → 2501.32] deal.
[2501.56 → 2501.72] Yeah.
[2501.78 → 2503.70] I paid ten bucks a gig
[2503.70 → 2504.58] for it or something.
[2504.72 → 2507.16] Like back then for DDR3.
[2507.34 → 2507.62] Yeah.
[2507.92 → 2508.48] It's like.
[2508.84 → 2509.80] That's so sweet.
[2509.88 → 2510.10] Yeah.
[2510.22 → 2511.00] It's like ridiculous.
[2511.50 → 2512.46] Um and then.
[2512.88 → 2513.60] 800D.
[2514.46 → 2515.02] 800D.
[2515.20 → 2515.72] TG07.
[2516.02 → 2516.22] Yeah.
[2518.06 → 2518.62] Alright.
[2518.62 → 2519.04] Um.
[2520.78 → 2521.70] Apparently there are
[2521.70 → 2523.10] rumoured GeForce GTX
[2523.10 → 2524.28] 700 launch dates.
[2524.46 → 2525.50] We can't really comment one
[2525.50 → 2526.04] way or the other.
[2526.04 → 2527.60] Good night from Portugal.
[2527.82 → 2528.38] Good night Portugal.
[2528.60 → 2528.96] Good night.
[2529.60 → 2530.00] Um.
[2530.16 → 2531.08] First time watching live.
[2531.16 → 2531.86] Love the new schedule.
[2532.08 → 2532.58] Thank you.
[2533.10 → 2533.96] Have you tried Raid Call?
[2534.08 → 2535.30] I haven't, unfortunately.
[2535.54 → 2535.90] I have.
[2535.96 → 2536.58] I don't mind it.
[2536.88 → 2537.98] Again the group though
[2537.98 → 2538.70] wasn't down.
[2539.30 → 2539.62] Right.
[2540.50 → 2541.26] Apparently if you put
[2541.26 → 2542.16] Skype on busy it won't
[2542.16 → 2542.84] interrupt your game.
[2543.06 → 2544.20] But it also won't tell you
[2544.20 → 2544.54] things.
[2544.78 → 2544.98] Yeah.
[2544.98 → 2545.64] A lot of the time.
[2545.80 → 2546.46] So it's like.
[2547.32 → 2548.90] It's like I either get
[2548.90 → 2550.12] completely interrupted or I
[2550.12 → 2551.38] get no notifications at all.
[2551.42 → 2551.52] Yeah.
[2551.60 → 2552.24] Damned if you do.
[2552.38 → 2553.08] Damned if you don't.
[2553.28 → 2553.38] Yeah.
[2553.38 → 2554.06] Kind of with that.
[2554.16 → 2555.10] The thing I liked about
[2555.10 → 2555.78] comes is.
[2556.04 → 2556.84] And like another thing
[2556.84 → 2557.30] with comes.
[2557.36 → 2558.72] Just little like ease of
[2558.72 → 2560.90] life situations where if
[2560.90 → 2563.02] you call someone it's like a
[2563.02 → 2565.38] deeper quieter tone.
[2566.22 → 2568.40] Instead of freaking Skype's
[2568.40 → 2569.46] like I'm going to kill your
[2569.46 → 2570.52] ears ringtone.
[2570.72 → 2571.74] Which is nuts.
[2572.00 → 2572.66] Like being on the
[2572.66 → 2573.52] receiving end of a Skype
[2573.52 → 2574.74] call isn't even as bad as
[2574.74 → 2575.60] calling someone.
[2575.76 → 2576.64] It's kind of bizarre that
[2576.64 → 2577.42] you can't change it.
[2577.88 → 2579.52] And it's so loud.
[2579.52 → 2580.74] Like I understand it's a
[2580.74 → 2581.82] branding element for them.
[2582.32 → 2583.58] You always know when a
[2583.58 → 2584.48] Skype call is coming in.
[2584.84 → 2586.02] But I mean when you're
[2586.02 → 2586.54] going out.
[2586.66 → 2587.44] It doesn't ring that way
[2587.44 → 2588.22] when you're going out.
[2589.74 → 2590.98] Like it's the annoying
[2590.98 → 2592.80] super common one.
[2593.12 → 2594.24] And it's insanely loud when
[2594.24 → 2594.70] you're going out.
[2594.78 → 2596.04] It's terrible and really
[2596.04 → 2596.36] annoying.
[2596.94 → 2598.28] With comes it's actually
[2598.28 → 2599.28] totally fine.
[2599.40 → 2599.72] I don't know.
[2600.26 → 2601.68] It's like it's I guess it's
[2601.68 → 2602.54] not the biggest thing.
[2602.80 → 2603.36] But that's one of the
[2603.36 → 2604.12] first things I noticed.
[2604.24 → 2604.42] Right.
[2604.56 → 2605.42] Because when I first
[2605.42 → 2606.18] called someone I was
[2606.18 → 2608.26] like oh wow that's pleasant.
[2608.26 → 2610.12] Kevin Norman says he's
[2610.12 → 2611.20] watching on his Nexus 4.
[2611.34 → 2612.30] Fantastic device.
[2612.52 → 2612.98] Smoothest.
[2613.08 → 2614.06] He's used however battery
[2614.06 → 2615.10] life is apparently not
[2615.10 → 2616.04] satisfactory.
[2617.28 → 2618.14] We've talked about
[2618.14 → 2619.32] NVIDIA Grid quite a few
[2619.32 → 2619.80] times.
[2620.02 → 2620.82] We don't really click
[2620.82 → 2621.76] links during the live
[2621.76 → 2622.44] stream just because
[2622.44 → 2623.42] sometimes it's bad.
[2623.82 → 2623.96] Yeah.
[2625.32 → 2626.36] Frostbite says apparently
[2626.36 → 2627.40] call quality is ten times
[2627.40 → 2628.10] better than Skype.
[2628.28 → 2629.68] I haven't experienced
[2629.68 → 2630.32] that.
[2630.64 → 2630.94] Okay.
[2631.10 → 2632.38] He's saying that about
[2632.38 → 2632.80] comes.
[2633.02 → 2633.32] Right.
[2634.06 → 2634.56] Okay.
[2634.74 → 2637.42] So let's sort of move on
[2637.42 → 2638.58] to our next news topic
[2638.58 → 2639.08] of the day.
[2639.52 → 2640.22] I kind of wish we had
[2640.22 → 2641.22] these tabs open already.
[2641.32 → 2641.86] We're going to do some
[2641.86 → 2642.78] community news items.
[2642.90 → 2644.28] However we have a bit of
[2644.28 → 2645.10] a public service
[2645.10 → 2647.34] announcement right now
[2647.34 → 2648.92] with respect to people
[2648.92 → 2650.42] posting community news
[2650.42 → 2653.90] items because it's we do
[2653.90 → 2655.16] want to encourage people
[2655.16 → 2658.26] to post news items on the
[2658.26 → 2659.14] Linus Tech Tips forum
[2659.14 → 2660.00] in the news section.
[2660.20 → 2661.00] It's great.
[2661.10 → 2662.16] We want that to be super
[2662.16 → 2662.48] active.
[2662.64 → 2663.86] We want anyone visiting
[2663.86 → 2665.24] the forum to be able to
[2665.24 → 2666.46] go to the news section and
[2666.46 → 2667.50] kind of be able to catch up
[2667.50 → 2668.10] on the tech news.
[2668.20 → 2668.78] That's awesome.
[2669.22 → 2670.90] However we don't want to
[2670.90 → 2672.14] run into a situation where
[2672.14 → 2673.46] Linus Tech Tips forum
[2673.46 → 2674.56] looks like we're
[2674.56 → 2676.30] plagiarizing in any way.
[2676.76 → 2679.56] So don't copy and paste the
[2679.56 → 2681.46] body of text from someone
[2681.46 → 2682.94] that you're you're pulling
[2682.94 → 2685.06] news from unless you're
[2685.06 → 2686.30] surrounding it in a quote.
[2687.08 → 2688.22] And I think a basic
[2688.22 → 2689.66] requirement for posting in
[2689.66 → 2690.58] the news section we should
[2690.58 → 2691.90] probably add this to the
[2691.90 → 2692.72] guidelines.
[2693.20 → 2693.22] Yeah.
[2693.52 → 2693.64] Yeah.
[2693.64 → 2694.64] is that you should be
[2694.64 → 2695.90] contributing some of your
[2695.90 → 2696.70] own take on it.
[2697.14 → 2698.14] Start the discussion up
[2698.14 → 2699.70] yourself rather than just
[2699.70 → 2701.52] posting the topic and then
[2701.52 → 2703.42] kind of leaving it there.
[2703.84 → 2705.32] So say something about it.
[2705.60 → 2706.10] Post it.
[2706.46 → 2707.76] Quote it appropriately and
[2707.76 → 2708.50] link to the source.
[2708.60 → 2709.30] I mean everyone's been
[2709.30 → 2710.26] linking to the source really
[2710.26 → 2711.04] well as it is.
[2711.20 → 2712.74] But we don't want to run into
[2712.74 → 2714.00] a situation where we're like
[2714.00 → 2716.46] bad guys because our forum
[2716.46 → 2718.64] community posts copied and pasted
[2719.40 → 2720.42] news articles from other
[2720.42 → 2720.78] websites.
[2720.78 → 2720.86] websites.
[2720.98 → 2721.50] I mean come on.
[2722.00 → 2723.42] Those websites where they
[2723.42 → 2724.40] just copy and paste everyone
[2724.40 → 2725.78] else's stuff is like not
[2725.78 → 2726.10] cool.
[2726.34 → 2727.14] We don't want to do that.
[2727.40 → 2727.86] We don't want to be that.
[2728.00 → 2728.98] The idea of the news
[2728.98 → 2730.52] section is yes it should be
[2730.52 → 2731.86] nice and fast like is
[2731.86 → 2733.06] already happening, but we've
[2733.06 → 2734.52] had cases where people are
[2734.52 → 2735.92] just copying and posting
[2735.92 → 2737.66] things from articles and
[2737.66 → 2739.14] like he said try and start
[2739.14 → 2739.76] the discussion.
[2740.28 → 2740.54] Okay.
[2740.68 → 2741.88] So with all of that said
[2741.88 → 2743.76] Goodbyes contributed this
[2743.76 → 2745.00] article where The Verge is
[2745.00 → 2746.56] reporting that Intel is
[2746.56 → 2747.94] claiming the new Iris
[2747.94 → 2749.12] graphics embedded in the
[2749.12 → 2750.58] upcoming Haswell CPUs can
[2750.58 → 2752.82] offer double or even triple
[2752.82 → 2754.44] the performance of Intel
[2754.44 → 2755.84] HD graphics 4000 that
[2755.84 → 2757.20] comes with current Ivy
[2757.20 → 2757.84] Bridge processors.
[2757.98 → 2758.48] There's a couple of
[2758.48 → 2759.62] things I'd like to comment
[2759.62 → 2760.50] on to start with.
[2760.58 → 2762.38] Number one is that not all
[2762.38 → 2764.02] Ivy Bridge processors have
[2764.02 → 2765.74] HD 4000 graphics.
[2766.42 → 2768.08] The lower end ones don't.
[2768.18 → 2769.26] In fact it's only the high
[2769.26 → 2771.10] end ones in many cases
[2771.10 → 2772.98] which is ridiculous that
[2772.98 → 2774.20] have higher end integrated
[2774.20 → 2775.68] graphics, and it's like it
[2775.68 → 2776.80] makes no sense because
[2776.80 → 2779.10] anyone buying that CPU
[2779.10 → 2780.48] probably is running a
[2780.48 → 2781.60] dedicated graphics card.
[2781.82 → 2781.88] Yeah.
[2782.40 → 2784.28] But that's that's the way
[2784.28 → 2784.66] it's been.
[2785.04 → 2786.70] So while it may be double
[2786.70 → 2787.88] or triple in HD 4000
[2787.88 → 2789.74] compared to whatever you're
[2789.74 → 2791.20] running already it may be
[2791.20 → 2792.42] even more than that.
[2792.68 → 2794.54] So let's go back to
[2794.54 → 2795.02] the graph.
[2795.32 → 2796.86] And one thing is that it's
[2796.86 → 2797.70] 3D Mark 11.
[2797.98 → 2799.12] Well okay I was going there.
[2799.30 → 2799.62] Okay.
[2800.62 → 2801.06] I wasn't.
[2801.46 → 2803.06] So I want to point at bars on
[2803.06 → 2803.50] the graphs.
[2803.62 → 2804.82] So the dark blue one on
[2804.82 → 2806.36] the far left this is 3D
[2806.36 → 2808.56] Mark 06 3D Mark Vantage
[2808.56 → 2809.64] and 3D Mark 11.
[2809.90 → 2811.24] So the one on the far left
[2811.24 → 2815.08] is hold on.
[2815.28 → 2816.78] Oh this colour coding seems
[2816.78 → 2817.20] off.
[2819.08 → 2819.52] Okay.
[2819.66 → 2820.36] Well whatever.
[2820.48 → 2821.44] I'm pretty sure this is
[2821.44 → 2822.04] supposed to be.
[2822.24 → 2823.50] Other than just shades of
[2823.50 → 2823.80] blue.
[2824.08 → 2824.40] Yeah.
[2824.52 → 2825.32] I'm pretty sure this is
[2825.32 → 2826.68] supposed to be HD 4000.
[2827.06 → 2828.90] And then I'm pretty sure
[2828.90 → 2831.56] that one of these is
[2831.56 → 2832.12] supposed to be.
[2832.12 → 2832.62] Oh crap.
[2832.70 → 2833.90] No I looked at this before.
[2834.54 → 2837.46] Scores normalized to the
[2837.46 → 2838.38] last gen.
[2838.94 → 2840.22] And then I think it was
[2840.22 → 2841.26] because there's going to be
[2841.26 → 2842.66] two different levels of
[2842.66 → 2844.28] Iris integrated graphics as
[2844.28 → 2844.56] well.
[2844.82 → 2846.04] So it's not just going to be
[2846.04 → 2848.02] HD whatever on exactly the
[2848.02 → 2848.56] same thing.
[2850.72 → 2852.76] But apparently I'm getting
[2852.76 → 2853.52] confused now.
[2853.52 → 2854.28] So anyway.
[2854.50 → 2854.64] Here.
[2854.86 → 2856.04] Let's just look at this.
[2856.62 → 2858.64] So with the premium Iris
[2858.64 → 2860.22] integrated graphics you're
[2860.22 → 2861.34] looking at up to two times
[2861.34 → 2862.78] increase over the last gen
[2862.78 → 2863.72] product.
[2864.06 → 2865.72] However I would actually
[2865.72 → 2866.86] look at something like 3D
[2866.86 → 2868.64] Mark 06 as more of an
[2868.64 → 2869.76] indicator for something like
[2869.76 → 2871.00] this because of a couple
[2871.00 → 2871.28] things.
[2871.38 → 2872.66] So number one is 3D Mark
[2872.66 → 2874.68] 11 and 3D Mark Vantage are
[2874.68 → 2875.42] both going to perform
[2875.42 → 2877.24] significantly better when
[2877.24 → 2878.32] you have more features
[2878.32 → 2879.32] enabled on the hardware.
[2879.32 → 2882.26] So Iris looks like it's
[2882.26 → 2884.38] probably a DirectX 11 part.
[2884.84 → 2885.92] Which doesn't mean that it's
[2885.92 → 2888.48] necessarily twice as powerful
[2888.48 → 2890.12] but if it has more features
[2890.12 → 2891.64] it'll inherently score better
[2891.64 → 2894.58] on 3D Mark 11 than a non-DirectX
[2894.58 → 2895.20] 11 part.
[2895.34 → 2896.08] Whereas if you go back to
[2896.08 → 2897.96] Ivy Bridge that was a
[2897.96 → 2900.24] DirectX 10 level part.
[2900.42 → 2901.74] So if you go back to a really
[2901.74 → 2903.84] old benchmark like 3D Mark 06
[2903.84 → 2906.16] then you are looking at it as
[2906.16 → 2908.18] okay well let's take away any
[2908.18 → 2909.34] advantage they get from an
[2909.34 → 2910.26] updated feature set.
[2910.34 → 2911.40] Let's go based on raw
[2911.40 → 2911.96] horsepower.
[2912.90 → 2914.66] It looks like more of maybe a
[2914.66 → 2916.36] 40 to 50 percent improvement.
[2916.84 → 2918.18] And then 3D Mark is often
[2918.18 → 2919.20] very theoretical.
[2920.42 → 2922.24] And so we might be looking at
[2922.24 → 2923.68] a smaller improvement than even
[2923.68 → 2924.22] that.
[2924.60 → 2925.08] Yeah.
[2925.44 → 2927.38] But you know leave it to
[2927.38 → 2928.96] leave it to well Slick.
[2929.04 → 2929.86] I was going to tell me and
[2929.86 → 2931.02] Slick to test it and let you
[2931.02 → 2932.30] guys know what's actually up.
[2932.30 → 2933.84] But in all likelihood it'll
[2933.84 → 2935.68] probably be Slick who is
[2935.68 → 2937.62] figuring out how Haswell
[2937.62 → 2938.24] stacks up.
[2938.60 → 2939.78] We asked Intel this time
[2939.78 → 2940.66] around in the past.
[2940.76 → 2942.02] We'd only asked for K chips
[2942.02 → 2943.52] because we know our audience
[2943.52 → 2945.08] is mostly interested in that.
[2945.52 → 2948.12] But actually we have four
[2948.12 → 2948.94] Haswell chips.
[2949.00 → 2949.80] I'm going to run and grab
[2949.80 → 2950.08] them.
[2950.38 → 2950.50] Oh.
[2951.16 → 2952.68] So that we can tell you guys
[2952.68 → 2952.94] not only how.
[2952.94 → 2953.84] Probably can't hear you that
[2953.84 → 2954.12] well anymore.
[2954.14 → 2955.60] Okay you tell them why we're
[2955.60 → 2956.02] doing that.
[2956.60 → 2957.92] I don't actually know why we're
[2957.92 → 2958.36] doing that.
[2958.48 → 2959.64] Because of lower TDPs?
[2960.24 → 2960.52] No.
[2960.52 → 2963.34] So we can evaluate the
[2963.34 → 2965.04] lower levels of integrated
[2965.04 → 2966.48] graphics cards.
[2966.88 → 2967.34] Oh right.
[2967.48 → 2967.64] Okay.
[2968.28 → 2969.38] I hope they heard that.
[2969.74 → 2970.00] Yeah.
[2970.28 → 2971.20] Mod chat's not telling me.
[2971.42 → 2973.20] So that we can take these
[2973.20 → 2975.38] chips, and we can compare them
[2975.38 → 2977.54] to the actual appropriate
[2977.54 → 2978.28] market competitor.
[2978.38 → 2979.22] Because it's one thing if we
[2979.22 → 2982.66] take you know a 3770K and we
[2982.66 → 2984.44] compare that to AMD's APU and
[2984.44 → 2985.66] it's like okay well it costs
[2985.66 → 2986.64] three times as much.
[2987.06 → 2988.28] Almost four times as much.
[2988.28 → 2990.70] And the lower end Intel chip
[2990.70 → 2992.10] doesn't have the same on board
[2992.10 → 2993.78] graphics as a 3770K.
[2994.10 → 2995.58] So this way we can take
[2995.58 → 2998.08] something like a 4430 which is
[2998.08 → 2999.26] one of the ones that we asked
[2999.26 → 3001.20] for, and we can compare that
[3001.20 → 3003.20] against the last generation
[3003.20 → 3005.34] products as well as AMD's APU's
[3005.34 → 3006.88] and let you guys know if you
[3006.88 → 3008.72] want a high-end entry level
[3008.72 → 3010.44] gaming experience on the cheap
[3010.44 → 3013.32] how well does Haswell actually
[3013.32 → 3014.80] stack up for you.
[3014.80 → 3016.66] So yeah there you go.
[3016.86 → 3018.44] The Verge is talking about this.
[3018.68 → 3020.34] Intel obviously those slides
[3020.34 → 3023.18] have Intel all over them.
[3023.40 → 3024.86] There's a nice big Intel logo
[3024.86 → 3025.90] so I wonder where that came
[3025.90 → 3026.18] from.
[3026.28 → 3027.34] They only used blue.
[3027.94 → 3029.80] And the whole slide is blue.
[3030.78 → 3033.00] So that's Intel spin on it but
[3033.00 → 3034.16] we're going to check it out.
[3034.22 → 3035.14] We're going to let you guys know
[3035.14 → 3037.26] what I've seen already from some
[3037.26 → 3038.18] of the die shots.
[3038.60 → 3039.56] So for those of you who don't
[3039.56 → 3041.12] know the die is the part of the
[3041.12 → 3041.48] CPU.
[3041.48 → 3043.48] There's a big metal piece on top.
[3043.58 → 3045.14] The die is the actual silicon
[3045.14 → 3046.68] inside that actually does all
[3046.68 → 3047.08] the work.
[3047.48 → 3048.60] And from some of the die shots
[3048.60 → 3051.02] that I've seen the GPU portion
[3051.02 → 3052.88] of Haswell is huge.
[3053.02 → 3053.24] Yeah.
[3053.70 → 3055.16] Percentage wise compared to
[3055.16 → 3055.70] Ivy Bridge.
[3056.06 → 3058.02] So I'm expecting a big
[3058.02 → 3059.64] performance improvement but I
[3059.64 → 3061.20] just don't know if it'll be
[3061.20 → 3062.26] that or if it'll be something
[3062.26 → 3062.58] else.
[3062.72 → 3062.80] Right.
[3063.40 → 3064.44] You know depend on the game
[3064.44 → 3065.50] depend on the drivers all
[3065.50 → 3065.98] these things.
[3066.20 → 3067.98] So let's move on to our next
[3067.98 → 3069.10] community news topic.
[3069.10 → 3071.86] This one is that that that
[3071.86 → 3075.04] was posted by Josie.
[3076.44 → 3076.74] Okay.
[3076.84 → 3078.40] So there's a picture of what
[3078.40 → 3081.70] is rumoured to be the HTC M4.
[3081.94 → 3084.38] So the HTC one is a phone that
[3084.38 → 3086.98] I have been using for over a
[3086.98 → 3087.56] month now.
[3087.72 → 3089.50] I absolutely love it.
[3089.70 → 3090.36] Quite honestly,
[3090.76 → 3093.80] I got a Samsung Galaxy S4
[3093.80 → 3096.40] about two weeks ago and I
[3096.40 → 3097.98] haven't actually brought myself
[3097.98 → 3099.60] to move my SIM into it yet.
[3102.00 → 3103.06] That's actually kind of funny.
[3103.44 → 3105.00] S4 has some cool features.
[3105.32 → 3108.90] We did use it for like a
[3108.90 → 3110.42] spot in the video where I'm
[3110.42 → 3111.52] getting a call from someone and
[3111.52 → 3112.66] I wave at the phone to answer
[3112.66 → 3113.90] it, and it works, and it's cool.
[3114.36 → 3115.76] Smart stays cool where it locks
[3115.76 → 3117.16] onto your eyes and doesn't dim
[3117.16 → 3118.16] the screen when you're reading
[3118.16 → 3118.66] things.
[3118.66 → 3121.44] It's wicked fast.
[3122.12 → 3122.98] Super fast.
[3123.18 → 3124.40] The fact that they have a built
[3124.40 → 3125.84] in like I have power toggles on
[3125.84 → 3127.74] my phone so I can quickly turn off
[3127.74 → 3129.16] my Wi-Fi and do things like that.
[3129.22 → 3130.40] But the fact that they have a
[3130.40 → 3133.10] built in power toggles that's like
[3133.10 → 3134.90] this big and has every setting you
[3134.90 → 3136.60] could possibly need on the S4 is
[3136.60 → 3137.76] really cool as well.
[3138.12 → 3138.38] You know,
[3138.42 → 3138.94] nice and quick.
[3139.00 → 3140.00] It's efficiency minded.
[3140.00 → 3143.34] But I just love I'm an Apple
[3143.34 → 3144.80] convert.
[3145.52 → 3146.76] I came from an iPhone.
[3147.12 → 3148.96] I want something that feels like
[3148.96 → 3150.18] yeah,
[3150.26 → 3150.94] it's like solid.
[3151.08 → 3151.66] It doesn't bend.
[3151.74 → 3152.42] I've dropped it.
[3152.70 → 3153.26] It didn't break.
[3153.82 → 3154.24] More than once.
[3154.36 → 3155.16] I've dropped it a couple of times.
[3155.20 → 3156.24] It's got a couple dents on it.
[3156.34 → 3158.00] And like pretty far.
[3158.16 → 3158.74] Onto tile.
[3159.04 → 3159.74] Onto tile.
[3160.08 → 3160.86] I've dropped it.
[3160.96 → 3161.42] It's happened.
[3161.90 → 3162.56] These things happen.
[3162.64 → 3163.28] When I saw it,
[3163.46 → 3164.62] you dropped it from up here and
[3164.62 → 3166.24] it is like hit a chair,
[3166.74 → 3167.94] like a wooden chair and then
[3167.94 → 3169.26] flipped like crazy and smacked
[3169.26 → 3169.76] against tile.
[3170.00 → 3171.48] So that was not cool.
[3171.72 → 3172.68] I was not happy.
[3173.14 → 3174.18] Didn't scratch the screen
[3174.18 → 3174.70] fortunately,
[3174.92 → 3175.58] which is really nice.
[3175.58 → 3176.50] I think it landed on the
[3176.50 → 3176.74] screen,
[3176.82 → 3176.94] right?
[3177.02 → 3178.16] It landed on the edge,
[3178.36 → 3178.82] on the corner,
[3178.96 → 3179.92] on the corner of the edge,
[3179.98 → 3181.70] which can be a sensitive spot.
[3181.84 → 3181.92] Oh yeah.
[3182.60 → 3183.00] So,
[3183.20 → 3183.68] so anyway,
[3184.02 → 3186.06] I'm excited about the M4 for
[3186.06 → 3186.66] a couple of reasons.
[3186.78 → 3188.58] Number one is if I had to
[3188.58 → 3189.90] complain about something
[3189.90 → 3191.10] about the one,
[3191.62 → 3192.58] it's that it's still a little
[3192.58 → 3193.26] bit big for me.
[3193.62 → 3195.14] I can use it one-handed.
[3195.24 → 3196.58] It's extremely awkward for me
[3196.58 → 3196.70] though.
[3196.70 → 3197.64] I have small hands.
[3197.64 → 3199.74] The M4 is rumoured to be
[3199.74 → 3201.88] a 4.3 inch smartphone,
[3201.88 → 3204.06] which will make it like,
[3204.46 → 3204.80] oh,
[3205.62 → 3206.00] oh,
[3206.08 → 3208.68] that'd be perfect for me.
[3208.68 → 3209.32] Isn't it a little bit
[3209.32 → 3209.90] spec chopped?
[3210.18 → 3210.78] It is.
[3210.96 → 3212.56] So the rumoured specs,
[3212.66 → 3213.62] it's still going to be dual
[3213.62 → 3214.48] core processor,
[3214.72 → 3215.68] LTE capable,
[3215.68 → 3217.08] 16 gig storage,
[3217.70 → 3219.26] ultra pixel camera,
[3219.42 → 3220.64] which is nice to see
[3220.64 → 3222.46] because it really,
[3222.58 → 3222.96] I actually,
[3223.08 → 3223.70] I took some,
[3223.84 → 3225.02] I took a picture of the other
[3225.02 → 3225.90] night of,
[3225.96 → 3228.12] of my baby playing with an
[3228.12 → 3229.10] Ethernet cable and someone
[3229.10 → 3230.00] on Instagram was like,
[3230.04 → 3230.90] did you take that picture
[3230.90 → 3231.52] with the one?
[3231.52 → 3233.84] Because considering how little
[3233.84 → 3235.70] light was in there and how
[3235.70 → 3236.34] good it looked,
[3236.40 → 3237.40] how much detail there was,
[3237.44 → 3238.02] it's awesome.
[3238.26 → 3240.02] When you compare the HTC One,
[3240.12 → 3241.28] the ultra pixels to something
[3241.28 → 3243.38] like a Galaxy S4 in broad
[3243.38 → 3243.74] daylight,
[3244.08 → 3247.26] the S4 destroys it because
[3247.26 → 3248.02] more pixels,
[3248.16 → 3249.30] if you can get the light to
[3249.30 → 3249.50] them,
[3249.78 → 3251.32] will give you a sharper image
[3251.32 → 3252.84] that you can blow up to all,
[3252.98 → 3253.76] you know,
[3253.92 → 3254.46] oblivion.
[3254.68 → 3255.54] You just often can't.
[3255.80 → 3257.22] You just often can't do it.
[3257.82 → 3258.24] You know,
[3258.28 → 3258.52] it's funny,
[3258.52 → 3259.54] people ask about the marks
[3259.54 → 3261.20] on my neck in some videos.
[3261.44 → 3262.30] I don't know if you guys saw me,
[3262.34 → 3263.16] I scratched my neck a little
[3263.16 → 3263.50] while ago.
[3263.56 → 3265.52] My skin stays really red for a
[3265.52 → 3265.90] long time.
[3265.94 → 3266.64] You can see it in there.
[3267.16 → 3268.66] My skin stays really red for a
[3268.66 → 3270.16] long time whenever I scratch it.
[3270.24 → 3271.42] So a lot of the time it's just
[3271.42 → 3271.70] like,
[3271.80 → 3271.98] eh,
[3272.24 → 3273.22] and then I end up with a weird
[3273.22 → 3273.94] mark on my neck.
[3275.72 → 3276.32] So anyway,
[3276.70 → 3278.06] 720p screen,
[3278.54 → 3279.88] two gigs RAM.
[3280.18 → 3281.68] They're saying similar build
[3281.68 → 3284.02] quality to the HTC One.
[3284.30 → 3285.08] Is it going to go through the
[3285.08 → 3286.08] same manufacturing process?
[3286.14 → 3286.80] Which is very cool.
[3286.80 → 3288.48] They have to cost it down.
[3288.60 → 3288.98] Somewhat.
[3289.34 → 3290.08] I would expect.
[3290.32 → 3290.46] Well,
[3290.48 → 3291.52] how much cheaper is it going to be?
[3291.84 → 3293.16] I don't know because you look at
[3293.16 → 3294.08] like the ones already,
[3294.18 → 3296.28] what a 199 with three year term
[3296.28 → 3296.72] phone.
[3296.96 → 3298.90] So maybe this will be a 99 with
[3298.90 → 3299.68] three year term phone.
[3300.48 → 3300.88] Wow.
[3301.66 → 3302.06] Making,
[3302.18 → 3302.42] I mean,
[3302.54 → 3304.00] would you consider something like
[3304.00 → 3304.92] that if you were up for renewal?
[3305.96 → 3307.10] Or would you go Nexus?
[3307.42 → 3308.06] Actually there,
[3308.14 → 3308.92] that's a good question.
[3309.00 → 3309.54] What would you do?
[3309.60 → 3309.86] Guys,
[3310.12 → 3311.44] I want to hear from you on Twitter.
[3311.92 → 3314.00] Would you go for build quality
[3314.00 → 3316.18] and construction and speed of the
[3316.18 → 3316.66] device?
[3316.78 → 3317.30] Or support.
[3317.30 → 3319.52] Or would you go for direct
[3319.52 → 3321.06] Android support and stock
[3321.06 → 3321.90] Android experience?
[3322.14 → 3323.24] What's more important to you?
[3323.82 → 3324.34] And why?
[3324.54 → 3325.72] And I'll let Slick answer his
[3325.72 → 3327.18] question while we go through that.
[3327.30 → 3328.28] I don't know, actually.
[3328.46 → 3329.66] I haven't had enough actual
[3329.66 → 3330.76] hands on time with a One.
[3330.98 → 3332.36] And I haven't had any actual
[3332.36 → 3333.56] hands on time with the recent
[3333.56 → 3334.40] Nexus phone.
[3334.56 → 3334.76] Okay.
[3334.76 → 3335.78] You've heard me rave about it
[3335.78 → 3335.94] though.
[3335.94 → 3336.52] Yes,
[3336.62 → 3337.10] but again,
[3337.16 → 3340.32] I haven't had any at all with the
[3340.32 → 3340.78] Nexus phone.
[3340.94 → 3342.34] But you know what your Nexus
[3342.34 → 3343.92] experience was like compared to
[3343.92 → 3344.14] the S3?
[3344.14 → 3345.60] My Nexus S was my favourite phone I
[3345.60 → 3346.02] ever owned.
[3346.10 → 3346.38] Okay.
[3346.94 → 3347.98] So knowing that,
[3348.10 → 3349.78] would you just kind of blindly go
[3349.78 → 3350.16] for it?
[3350.26 → 3351.04] Very possibly.
[3351.32 → 3352.52] The reason why I got an S3,
[3352.60 → 3353.50] like I like my S3,
[3353.88 → 3355.38] but the reason why I got one was
[3355.38 → 3356.84] because Nexus was not available.
[3357.64 → 3358.02] Right.
[3358.20 → 3360.00] It wasn't because I actually chose it
[3360.00 → 3360.58] over that.
[3360.70 → 3363.04] My carrier did not have anything else.
[3363.28 → 3363.58] Right.
[3363.58 → 3365.54] I had like four options.
[3365.92 → 3366.20] Okay.
[3367.12 → 3368.54] Like it was not that many options.
[3368.70 → 3369.38] And like S3.
[3370.22 → 3371.26] S2 was one of them.
[3371.62 → 3372.02] S3.
[3372.36 → 3372.60] Yeah.
[3372.80 → 3374.02] And then I don't actually remember
[3374.02 → 3374.44] the other two,
[3374.56 → 3375.60] but like it was,
[3375.72 → 3377.48] it was an S3 that I was going to
[3377.48 → 3378.50] get because it was clearly the
[3378.50 → 3379.04] best option.
[3379.92 → 3381.56] And at that time there was only
[3381.56 → 3382.96] two that I would really want.
[3383.02 → 3384.22] And it was Nexus or S3.
[3384.28 → 3385.40] And I was going to get the Nexus
[3385.40 → 3387.60] if I could because of the amazing
[3387.60 → 3388.90] experience I had with Nexus S.
[3389.02 → 3389.30] Right.
[3389.42 → 3390.32] But I didn't have the option
[3390.32 → 3391.78] and S3 was a perfect solution.
[3392.14 → 3392.50] Okay.
[3392.50 → 3393.50] Well, let's take it as a more
[3393.50 → 3394.34] general thing then.
[3394.46 → 3395.02] Forget the one,
[3395.18 → 3396.58] forget the current gen Nexus.
[3397.20 → 3398.50] Would you take the guarantee
[3398.50 → 3399.66] of software support
[3399.66 → 3401.84], or would you take the beefy hardware
[3401.84 → 3403.58] and the nice feeling build quality?
[3403.74 → 3404.76] What's more important to you?
[3404.88 → 3406.62] The device or the software?
[3407.46 → 3409.28] With mobile right now,
[3409.34 → 3411.54] almost the software.
[3411.74 → 3412.22] You think so?
[3412.58 → 3413.24] But what if,
[3413.42 → 3413.72] I mean,
[3413.88 → 3414.28] honestly,
[3414.42 → 3416.48] HTC has been one of the more
[3416.48 → 3418.06] cooperative manufacturers
[3418.06 → 3419.72] in terms of unlocking bootloaders.
[3419.72 → 3420.72] And I was just going to say
[3420.72 → 3421.86] with certain bootloaders and stuff,
[3421.90 → 3422.46] you might just be able
[3422.46 → 3423.16] to install it yourself.
[3423.96 → 3424.58] So there's that
[3424.58 → 3425.58] if it's with HTC.
[3425.72 → 3427.02] But there's been certain phones
[3427.02 → 3427.72] that have been problematic
[3427.72 → 3428.30] with that.
[3428.56 → 3428.80] Right.
[3429.06 → 3430.10] So it's interesting.
[3431.98 → 3433.28] I'd have to do more research
[3433.28 → 3435.32] on older HTC phones
[3435.32 → 3437.00] to see how they reacted
[3437.00 → 3437.86] to different things.
[3438.82 → 3439.22] Okay.
[3439.78 → 3440.10] Right.
[3440.32 → 3441.18] Like their perspective
[3441.18 → 3442.04] on people messing
[3442.04 → 3442.66] with their stuff.
[3442.66 → 3444.50] I suspect that
[3444.50 → 3445.82] with their current attitude,
[3446.30 → 3446.96] which is,
[3447.34 → 3447.76] holy crap,
[3447.86 → 3448.36] we're desperate.
[3449.50 → 3450.30] We have to get
[3450.30 → 3450.94] the community,
[3451.18 → 3451.56] like,
[3452.02 → 3452.64] on board.
[3453.08 → 3454.34] They got to be on our side.
[3454.46 → 3455.56] We need to make this work.
[3455.58 → 3456.34] Then it would probably be fine
[3456.34 → 3457.10] and I would probably
[3457.10 → 3458.02] end up going with a one.
[3458.20 → 3458.54] I mean,
[3458.62 → 3459.28] looking at,
[3459.40 → 3459.78] okay,
[3460.24 → 3461.42] looking at sort of
[3461.42 → 3462.14] the fact that they're
[3462.14 → 3463.38] even launching an M4
[3463.38 → 3464.96] is extremely encouraging.
[3465.56 → 3465.76] Like,
[3465.94 → 3467.54] as you guys probably know,
[3467.66 → 3469.24] I have a contact at HTC
[3469.24 → 3470.58] who provides us with phones.
[3470.70 → 3471.60] We've done some giveaways.
[3472.60 → 3472.94] We do,
[3473.10 → 3473.48] we've done,
[3473.58 → 3474.40] I switched with two
[3474.40 → 3475.20] of their phones now.
[3475.74 → 3477.04] The overall impression
[3477.04 → 3477.74] that I get
[3477.74 → 3479.56] is they're extremely pleased
[3479.56 → 3482.42] with demand and sales
[3482.42 → 3483.04] for the one,
[3483.26 → 3483.94] which means
[3483.94 → 3484.98] they have some cash,
[3485.20 → 3486.68] which is allowing them
[3486.68 → 3488.58] to produce
[3488.58 → 3489.58] something like an M4.
[3489.80 → 3490.12] I mean,
[3490.16 → 3491.30] they were so close
[3491.30 → 3491.96] to the edge.
[3492.10 → 3493.38] Or even produce more ones.
[3493.50 → 3494.52] Or even produce more ones.
[3494.62 → 3495.28] They were so close
[3495.28 → 3495.64] to the edge
[3495.64 → 3496.70] they couldn't get cameras
[3496.70 → 3497.34] for the one
[3497.34 → 3498.26] because they weren't
[3498.26 → 3499.50] a tier one supplier anymore.
[3499.86 → 3500.74] Whereas I suspect
[3500.74 → 3501.58] that's going to change.
[3501.60 → 3502.66] over the next little bit
[3502.66 → 3503.40] with how much excitement.
[3503.54 → 3503.72] I mean,
[3503.72 → 3505.22] did you see the Enacted review
[3505.22 → 3506.04] of the S4
[3506.04 → 3507.80] and the Enacted review
[3507.80 → 3508.30] of the one?
[3508.56 → 3508.86] Yeah.
[3509.02 → 3510.20] The entire one review
[3510.20 → 3511.58] was basically slamming
[3511.58 → 3512.14] the S4
[3512.14 → 3513.76] and the entire S4 review
[3513.76 → 3514.28] was,
[3514.40 → 3514.50] oh,
[3514.52 → 3514.76] but wait,
[3514.80 → 3515.40] you could also get
[3515.40 → 3516.30] this other thing.
[3516.44 → 3516.74] Yeah.
[3517.38 → 3517.84] I was like,
[3517.90 → 3518.24] really?
[3518.60 → 3519.66] You guys did that?
[3519.88 → 3520.74] We got flamed
[3520.74 → 3522.14] because people were like,
[3522.20 → 3522.36] oh,
[3522.40 → 3523.42] it wasn't that bad.
[3523.88 → 3524.54] Read between the lines,
[3524.62 → 3524.82] people.
[3524.90 → 3525.50] It was that bad.
[3525.54 → 3526.54] Read between the lines.
[3526.54 → 3527.86] When a major publication
[3527.86 → 3529.06] says that,
[3529.24 → 3530.12] they mean,
[3530.34 → 3530.78] like,
[3532.78 → 3533.22] like,
[3533.30 → 3534.20] that's what they were doing.
[3534.56 → 3534.76] Yeah.
[3535.10 → 3535.28] Yeah.
[3535.34 → 3535.84] And I was like,
[3535.90 → 3536.20] whoa.
[3536.70 → 3537.46] But I mean,
[3537.60 → 3537.86] you know,
[3537.90 → 3539.14] it's not like a major publication
[3539.14 → 3539.98] is going to not,
[3540.08 → 3540.92] is going to get snubbed
[3540.92 → 3542.56] on a future Galaxy device,
[3542.70 → 3542.94] you know?
[3543.44 → 3544.10] If anything,
[3544.26 → 3545.74] Samsung's probably going to come back
[3545.74 → 3546.52] with something to prove.
[3547.08 → 3547.96] I think they've proven
[3547.96 → 3549.02] time and time again
[3549.02 → 3550.78] that they are resilient
[3550.78 → 3552.22] when it comes to
[3552.22 → 3553.64] being dominant at things.
[3554.32 → 3554.54] It's like,
[3554.74 → 3555.14] I mean,
[3555.30 → 3556.36] where was Samsung
[3556.36 → 3557.58] for TVs
[3557.58 → 3559.66] 10 years ago?
[3560.86 → 3561.64] Five years ago.
[3561.64 → 3561.84] Yeah.
[3562.66 → 3563.02] Now,
[3563.16 → 3563.64] they're just like,
[3563.70 → 3564.56] why would you buy anything
[3564.56 → 3565.46] but a Samsung TV?
[3566.32 → 3567.44] If you walked into a store,
[3567.50 → 3567.88] what would you buy?
[3568.80 → 3569.86] Not a Samsung TV.
[3569.96 → 3570.46] What would you buy?
[3570.64 → 3571.28] I'm curious.
[3571.62 → 3571.94] Psyche.
[3572.26 → 3572.58] Psyche.
[3572.72 → 3572.96] Oh,
[3573.08 → 3573.32] okay.
[3573.40 → 3574.34] We can talk about that.
[3574.54 → 3574.66] But,
[3574.96 → 3575.30] okay.
[3575.46 → 3575.68] Okay.
[3575.68 → 3576.78] A month ago.
[3576.80 → 3577.42] 50 inch,
[3577.50 → 3579.36] 50-inch 4K LED TV.
[3579.70 → 3580.92] I'm not buying a Samsung TV.
[3581.04 → 3583.08] I'm buying a Psyche 50 inch 4K.
[3583.08 → 3584.54] Psyche or whatever it is.
[3584.62 → 3585.02] Psyche,
[3585.02 → 3585.16] Psyche.
[3585.16 → 3585.52] What was it?
[3585.52 → 3587.08] Was it $1,199 or $1,299?
[3587.34 → 3588.14] It was $1,199.
[3588.16 → 3589.14] $1,199.
[3589.36 → 3590.46] It's at a new low.
[3591.06 → 3593.10] $1,200 gets you a 4K TV
[3593.10 → 3593.78] and I think there was
[3593.78 → 3594.94] a shipping promo on it
[3594.94 → 3596.26] from Tiger Direct at one point.
[3596.98 → 3597.32] Well,
[3597.68 → 3598.02] Groupon,
[3598.10 → 3598.64] it's free shipping.
[3598.92 → 3599.90] The Groupon is free shipping.
[3599.92 → 3600.12] Okay.
[3600.20 → 3600.38] Free shipping.
[3600.56 → 3601.20] Is it still running?
[3601.94 → 3603.30] I have no idea.
[3603.54 → 3603.82] Okay,
[3603.96 → 3604.36] guys,
[3604.52 → 3604.82] I hope.
[3604.82 → 3605.42] I sent it to you.
[3605.68 → 3606.22] It's in your email.
[3606.40 → 3606.96] It's in my email?
[3607.16 → 3607.32] Yeah.
[3607.32 → 3607.48] Okay,
[3607.56 → 3607.76] okay,
[3607.84 → 3608.14] guys,
[3608.46 → 3610.24] we're going to launch this up for you
[3610.24 → 3614.04] because you can be 4K ready now.
[3614.60 → 3614.86] Apparently,
[3614.86 → 3615.56] it might be Psyche.
[3616.08 → 3616.36] I don't know.
[3616.36 → 3616.68] Psyche,
[3616.90 → 3617.12] Psyche.
[3617.12 → 3618.20] I didn't look at the name for it.
[3618.34 → 3618.70] Psyche?
[3618.98 → 3619.24] Okay,
[3619.36 → 3619.72] apparently,
[3619.84 → 3620.68] this is still running.
[3620.92 → 3620.94] So,
[3621.02 → 3621.26] I'm gonna...
[3621.26 → 3621.40] See, look,
[3621.48 → 3621.68] look.
[3622.68 → 3623.58] Free shipping,
[3623.92 → 3625.08] free returns.
[3625.68 → 3626.08] So,
[3626.18 → 3628.08] if there's some kind of problem...
[3628.08 → 3628.30] Okay,
[3628.38 → 3628.66] hold on,
[3628.70 → 3628.96] hold on.
[3629.08 → 3629.40] Guys,
[3629.58 → 3631.40] if you want a 4K TV...
[3631.40 → 3631.82] Psyche?
[3632.06 → 3634.12] We don't get any kind of referral fee
[3634.12 → 3635.06] or anything for this,
[3635.12 → 3637.28] so we have no skin in the game
[3637.28 → 3638.86] when it comes to whether you buy one of these.
[3639.20 → 3639.46] Oh,
[3639.60 → 3640.70] there are 4 hours left.
[3640.94 → 3641.44] Look at that.
[3641.52 → 3641.82] Wow.
[3642.62 → 3643.02] So,
[3643.08 → 3643.94] the timing's perfect.
[3644.52 → 3644.68] So,
[3645.04 → 3645.36] you...
[3645.36 → 3646.12] For 11...
[3646.12 → 3647.38] Should I just buy one right now?
[3647.62 → 3648.20] Oh, my goodness.
[3648.28 → 3648.84] Should I just do it?
[3648.98 → 3649.66] Oh, my God.
[3649.66 → 3650.96] Is that the craziest thing ever?
[3651.08 → 3652.22] That's pretty freaking crazy.
[3652.68 → 3653.32] Should I just do it?
[3653.46 → 3653.86] What do you think?
[3654.34 → 3654.66] No.
[3654.96 → 3655.22] Okay,
[3655.32 → 3655.50] no.
[3656.24 → 3657.70] It's Slick's fault I didn't buy one.
[3658.48 → 3658.84] So,
[3658.94 → 3660.66] my wife's going to be super pleased with you.
[3661.12 → 3661.38] Yay.
[3661.38 → 3663.36] But you got just under 5 hours
[3663.36 → 3664.68] to buy a 4K TV
[3664.68 → 3666.38] for $1,200.
[3667.00 → 3667.38] Now,
[3667.54 → 3668.14] get this.
[3668.96 → 3671.16] I feel like QVC
[3671.16 → 3672.12] right now.
[3673.74 → 3675.10] For a limited time only,
[3675.46 → 3676.28] you can get this.
[3676.44 → 3676.74] 4K.
[3676.74 → 3677.64] Beautiful TV.
[3678.12 → 3678.76] Free shipping,
[3678.76 → 3679.64] free returns.
[3679.96 → 3681.08] I forget who it was.
[3681.16 → 3682.24] It wasn't Engadget.
[3682.54 → 3684.04] It might not have been Gizmodo.
[3684.26 → 3685.20] But I was reading
[3685.20 → 3686.04] an article
[3686.04 → 3687.20] from one of the writers
[3687.20 → 3688.92] at a fairly major publication
[3688.92 → 3689.42] like that.
[3689.52 → 3689.60] Like,
[3689.68 → 3690.80] I don't know if it was Wired.
[3691.00 → 3691.20] Like,
[3691.22 → 3692.30] it was one of those guys.
[3692.34 → 3692.98] And they were saying,
[3693.14 → 3694.48] this thing's actually
[3694.48 → 3695.22] kind of incredible.
[3696.06 → 3696.28] Like,
[3696.30 → 3697.60] it's not just a piece of crap.
[3697.68 → 3698.30] And you know what?
[3698.60 → 3699.46] It's one of those things
[3699.46 → 3700.12] where people see it
[3700.12 → 3700.38] and they go,
[3700.44 → 3700.54] oh,
[3700.56 → 3701.78] it's too good to be true
[3701.78 → 3702.86] because the other
[3702.86 → 3703.96] traditional manufacturers
[3703.96 → 3704.92] aren't doing this.
[3705.26 → 3705.92] But you know what?
[3705.92 → 3706.64] They could.
[3706.64 → 3707.26] They could.
[3707.54 → 3708.52] If either of us
[3708.52 → 3709.14] had the money,
[3709.46 → 3710.22] I would suggest
[3710.22 → 3710.92] that either of us
[3710.92 → 3711.30] bought it.
[3711.44 → 3712.06] Just to like,
[3712.50 → 3713.82] clear up Twitch chat
[3713.82 → 3714.86] being unhappy with me.
[3715.66 → 3716.20] Neither of us
[3716.20 → 3717.48] should actually buy one.
[3717.48 → 3717.72] Yeah.
[3717.96 → 3718.80] I don't really have
[3718.80 → 3719.58] the money right now.
[3719.58 → 3719.84] No.
[3720.40 → 3720.78] Okay,
[3720.88 → 3721.40] but get this.
[3721.40 → 3723.08] This is a 1080p screen.
[3723.72 → 3726.06] This notebook entirely
[3726.06 → 3727.52] costs like $1,200.
[3728.56 → 3728.96] So,
[3729.18 → 3730.62] if you can't manufacture
[3730.62 → 3731.58] four of the screen
[3731.58 → 3732.10] for $1,200,
[3732.50 → 3733.08] then you suck.
[3734.04 → 3734.52] So,
[3734.56 → 3735.20] they can do it.
[3735.30 → 3736.38] They just don't.
[3736.80 → 3737.02] So,
[3737.02 → 3737.36] so,
[3737.50 → 3738.62] Seiko's basically gone,
[3739.04 → 3739.26] yep,
[3739.54 → 3740.32] we are gonna
[3740.32 → 3741.46] screw
[3741.46 → 3743.08] the traditional market.
[3743.34 → 3744.14] And we are gonna
[3744.14 → 3745.94] drive pricing down.
[3746.02 → 3747.34] We are going to buy market share
[3747.34 → 3748.14] by doing this.
[3748.14 → 3749.20] and,
[3749.28 → 3750.20] yeah,
[3750.48 → 3751.84] whatever everyone else.
[3752.14 → 3752.36] Yeah,
[3752.58 → 3753.14] come at me,
[3753.22 → 3753.40] bro.
[3753.74 → 3753.88] Like,
[3754.38 → 3754.82] I honestly,
[3754.96 → 3755.88] I wouldn't be surprised
[3755.88 → 3756.50] if like,
[3756.60 → 3757.72] Seiko's CEO
[3757.72 → 3758.34] gets like,
[3758.44 → 3759.02] assassinated.
[3760.06 → 3760.18] Like,
[3760.34 → 3760.60] yeah,
[3761.20 → 3761.52] yeah,
[3761.52 → 3761.94] honestly.
[3762.42 → 3763.60] People have been killed
[3763.60 → 3764.72] for less money
[3764.72 → 3766.22] than Seiko just lost
[3766.22 → 3767.36] for Sony,
[3767.72 → 3768.12] Samsung,
[3768.56 → 3768.86] LG,
[3769.66 → 3770.56] other guys like that.
[3770.72 → 3771.16] 100%.
[3771.16 → 3772.46] There's more than one person
[3772.46 → 3773.12] I've seen go by
[3773.12 → 3773.78] in the Twitch chat.
[3773.84 → 3775.08] I don't know how honest this is,
[3775.14 → 3776.44] but more than one person so far,
[3776.82 → 3777.98] other than wanting me fired
[3777.98 → 3779.18] for telling you not to buy it.
[3779.70 → 3780.10] But,
[3780.10 → 3781.68] but more than one person
[3781.68 → 3782.16] has gone,
[3782.38 → 3783.62] gone by so far,
[3784.06 → 3786.10] saying that they've bought it already.
[3786.46 → 3786.82] Really?
[3787.12 → 3787.34] Yeah.
[3787.74 → 3788.10] Wow.
[3788.34 → 3788.62] So,
[3789.10 → 3790.34] Groupon should be giving us,
[3790.44 → 3790.64] mind you,
[3790.66 → 3791.62] I don't think there's much margin
[3791.62 → 3792.86] left in that to give us a cut.
[3792.96 → 3794.02] Groupon kind of removes
[3794.02 → 3795.04] all the margin.
[3795.18 → 3795.48] Yeah.
[3795.84 → 3796.42] Reefer's saying,
[3796.80 → 3798.08] did you actually just buy one?
[3799.10 → 3799.50] I know,
[3799.62 → 3800.64] one of my Twitch mods
[3800.64 → 3801.86] is saying that you just bought one.
[3802.48 → 3802.84] Seriously?
[3804.02 → 3804.38] Oh,
[3804.42 → 3805.02] that's crazy.
[3805.22 → 3805.42] Yeah.
[3805.60 → 3805.80] Yeah,
[3805.84 → 3806.90] apparently one of the Twitch mods
[3806.90 → 3807.50] just bought one.
[3807.54 → 3807.64] So,
[3807.68 → 3808.04] there you go,
[3808.10 → 3808.36] guys.
[3808.70 → 3809.06] Wow.
[3809.26 → 3809.88] We should start,
[3810.06 → 3810.58] you know what,
[3810.66 → 3811.72] we should figure out,
[3811.72 → 3811.98] like,
[3812.08 → 3813.58] affiliate programs that are good,
[3813.74 → 3815.02] and we should actually tell
[3815.02 → 3815.80] these people deal
[3815.80 → 3816.52] that don't suck.
[3817.14 → 3818.06] Because if we,
[3818.06 → 3818.36] We could do,
[3818.48 → 3818.56] like,
[3818.60 → 3820.22] a deal of the week or something.
[3820.24 → 3820.84] Deal of the week or something like that.
[3820.84 → 3821.20] But we have to,
[3821.30 → 3821.40] like,
[3821.42 → 3822.30] make sure it doesn't suck.
[3822.30 → 3822.68] You know what,
[3822.74 → 3822.92] guys?
[3823.06 → 3823.28] Okay,
[3823.52 → 3824.24] we're going to go through
[3824.24 → 3825.38] the Twitter responses
[3825.38 → 3826.62] that I asked for before.
[3826.84 → 3828.02] But would you guys be down?
[3828.02 → 3829.72] If we found something this crazy
[3829.72 → 3831.76] and we were getting a 3% cut
[3831.76 → 3832.34] or whatever
[3832.34 → 3833.56] we were getting on it,
[3833.60 → 3834.48] would you guys be down
[3834.48 → 3835.50] to have us tell you
[3835.50 → 3836.94] that we found a cool deal?
[3837.52 → 3837.84] So,
[3837.96 → 3838.08] there.
[3838.22 → 3839.14] Let us know what you think.
[3839.26 → 3839.70] We've got to figure out
[3839.70 → 3840.58] if you guys even,
[3840.84 → 3841.16] wow,
[3841.32 → 3841.94] Twitch chat is,
[3842.02 → 3843.06] Twitch chat is,
[3843.06 → 3843.32] like,
[3843.42 → 3844.74] extremely in support.
[3844.82 → 3845.70] Because we don't want to be,
[3845.84 → 3847.32] we don't want to be QVC.
[3847.76 → 3848.64] That's not what we are.
[3848.94 → 3850.18] We already do unboxing,
[3850.26 → 3850.42] which,
[3850.54 → 3851.36] as far as I'm concerned,
[3851.42 → 3852.42] is not that far away
[3852.42 → 3853.46] from basically just
[3853.46 → 3854.74] video merchandising
[3854.74 → 3855.46] for the product.
[3855.46 → 3856.40] So,
[3856.54 → 3858.00] apparently people are,
[3858.00 → 3859.82] Twitch chat is very,
[3860.02 → 3861.04] very into it.
[3861.12 → 3862.06] Twitch chat is apparently
[3862.06 → 3863.02] pleased.
[3863.20 → 3864.82] I haven't seen a single person
[3864.82 → 3865.20] say no.
[3865.20 → 3866.46] With this deal we've presented.
[3867.52 → 3869.02] Twitch chat is pleased.
[3869.68 → 3869.88] So,
[3869.96 → 3870.70] so there you go.
[3870.78 → 3871.02] Let's,
[3871.18 → 3871.66] let's go back.
[3871.72 → 3873.12] What question did I ask on Twitter?
[3873.60 → 3874.42] I actually don't remember.
[3874.50 → 3875.22] I don't remember anymore.
[3875.26 → 3876.72] Fire Slick by 4K TV.
[3876.80 → 3877.00] Oh,
[3877.02 → 3877.14] okay.
[3877.18 → 3877.80] There's a lot of,
[3877.88 → 3878.90] there's a lot of Twitter.
[3879.00 → 3879.16] Okay,
[3879.22 → 3879.56] so Slick,
[3879.62 → 3880.34] you're fired, apparently.
[3880.66 → 3880.92] Damn.
[3881.94 → 3882.42] What are your thoughts
[3882.42 → 3883.20] on Google Glass?
[3883.28 → 3883.62] You know what?
[3883.66 → 3884.48] This is one of the topics
[3884.48 → 3885.62] I do want to talk about later.
[3885.96 → 3886.92] I think Google Glass
[3886.92 → 3887.80] is a great idea
[3887.80 → 3889.86] and I don't really care
[3889.86 → 3890.86] about it at all right now.
[3890.94 → 3891.44] One thing,
[3891.76 → 3892.86] we got to do build logs
[3892.86 → 3893.86] before the end of the stream.
[3893.96 → 3894.14] Oh,
[3894.22 → 3894.44] wow.
[3894.52 → 3895.48] And I want to do
[3895.48 → 3897.46] a call-out for the forum
[3897.46 → 3898.72] and something on the forum
[3898.72 → 3899.44] before the end of the stream.
[3899.46 → 3899.76] Okay,
[3899.80 → 3901.18] I'm putting this down,
[3901.42 → 3902.98] forum call out,
[3903.40 → 3904.06] build logs.
[3904.14 → 3904.68] I'm adding that
[3904.68 → 3905.12] to make sure
[3905.12 → 3906.10] we don't forget this stuff
[3906.10 → 3906.30] because,
[3906.54 → 3906.68] you know,
[3906.74 → 3907.68] I felt like we started out
[3907.68 → 3908.40] a little slow today
[3908.40 → 3909.68] but we have picked up
[3909.68 → 3910.66] some steam here.
[3911.06 → 3911.72] So we'll talk about
[3911.72 → 3912.40] Google Glass.
[3912.78 → 3913.02] Okay,
[3913.10 → 3913.28] right,
[3913.36 → 3914.04] I asked about
[3914.04 → 3915.36] phone software
[3915.36 → 3916.02] versus hardware.
[3916.28 → 3917.14] So let's go back
[3917.14 → 3917.78] and let's take some
[3917.78 → 3919.16] of these callers.
[3919.24 → 3919.52] Caller,
[3919.62 → 3920.04] you're on the
[3920.30 → 3921.24] you're on Linus Tech Tips.
[3923.64 → 3925.46] I like the BBZ10
[3925.46 → 3926.12] because I can install
[3926.12 → 3926.78] apps from Android.
[3927.52 → 3928.64] I've heard about that.
[3928.72 → 3929.28] Try that.
[3929.72 → 3931.08] Slick's done his day one video.
[3931.18 → 3931.96] We're going to upload it soon.
[3932.06 → 3933.20] I've heard that the support
[3933.20 → 3934.14] for it is kind of funky.
[3934.24 → 3934.44] Okay,
[3934.66 → 3934.96] so let's.
[3934.96 → 3936.36] But I haven't tried it yet.
[3936.78 → 3937.82] So I'm going to try that
[3937.82 → 3939.78] and hopefully in a review soon
[3939.78 → 3940.48] I will be talking.
[3940.54 → 3941.34] We'll get into that
[3941.34 → 3942.60] and Slick's I Switched.
[3942.60 → 3943.44] He's doing a 30-day
[3943.44 → 3944.74] BlackBerry 10 trial.
[3945.06 → 3945.08] So,
[3945.80 → 3946.58] no,
[3946.66 → 3947.26] you can't over,
[3947.34 → 3948.36] you can't RMA a card
[3948.36 → 3949.36] because it doesn't overclock.
[3949.46 → 3949.64] Sorry,
[3949.80 → 3949.98] sorry,
[3950.06 → 3950.16] man.
[3950.92 → 3951.68] How's the AMOLED
[3951.68 → 3952.48] on the S4 at night?
[3952.68 → 3954.48] The AMOLED on the S4
[3954.48 → 3955.50] is actually outstanding
[3955.50 → 3956.34] compared to the S3.
[3956.42 → 3956.94] It doesn't have
[3956.94 → 3957.92] that same blurriness.
[3958.28 → 3959.92] It's still not quite like
[3959.92 → 3961.90] LCD in terms of
[3961.90 → 3962.70] if you look at it
[3962.70 → 3963.32] under a microscope
[3963.32 → 3964.72] but it looks pretty darn good.
[3965.48 → 3966.64] Which socket should I get
[3966.64 → 3968.02] for an Intel gaming rig?
[3968.12 → 3969.56] I'd still go $1,155
[3969.56 → 3970.32] but if you can
[3970.32 → 3971.64] hold off for about 30 days.
[3973.22 → 3973.90] Slick should get
[3973.90 → 3974.22] one of those
[3974.22 → 3974.90] special agent
[3974.90 → 3975.72] wired earpieces
[3975.72 → 3976.86] for when you're sitting
[3976.86 → 3977.52] on the live stream.
[3978.08 → 3978.92] I almost do
[3978.92 → 3979.76] because I wear,
[3979.96 → 3981.02] I don't wear it the whole time
[3981.02 → 3982.40] but I have my ear pro.
[3982.50 → 3983.94] First day forum member.
[3984.28 → 3985.24] Very nice.
[3985.90 → 3987.18] Everyone should join the forum
[3987.18 → 3988.02] if you haven't already.
[3988.62 → 3989.58] LinusTechTips.com
[3989.58 → 3991.02] I can transition from that
[3991.02 → 3991.88] into my forum call.
[3991.88 → 3993.60] We are serious business.
[3994.96 → 3995.70] Okay, okay.
[3995.84 → 3996.54] Hold that thought.
[3996.70 → 3997.32] Okay, okay.
[3997.36 → 3998.10] So this guy says
[3998.10 → 3999.20] I'd go HTC One.
[4000.12 → 4000.56] HTC One.
[4001.18 → 4002.12] More, more batter.
[4002.52 → 4003.14] He either means
[4003.14 → 4003.92] better or baller.
[4003.98 → 4004.88] I'm not quite sure which.
[4005.98 → 4007.56] Samsung Galaxy S3 users
[4007.56 → 4009.38] so far hate interacting
[4009.38 → 4010.94] with Sense UI from HTC.
[4011.26 → 4012.10] I'm with Touch ID
[4012.10 → 4013.20] on this until they improve.
[4013.50 → 4014.32] So he's saying
[4014.32 → 4016.02] software is a huge factor
[4016.02 → 4016.46] for him.
[4017.16 → 4017.78] Or she.
[4017.94 → 4018.14] Jamie.
[4018.28 → 4018.98] Jamie could be she,
[4018.98 → 4019.48] he or she.
[4019.48 → 4020.48] Software is very easily.
[4020.56 → 4021.56] As a Nexus 4 owner
[4021.56 → 4022.46] I'd go for the phone
[4022.46 → 4023.38] that gets updated first
[4023.38 → 4024.58] get all the jelly beans.
[4024.98 → 4025.10] Okay.
[4025.62 → 4026.24] Build quality.
[4026.40 → 4026.98] I'm a skater
[4026.98 → 4028.30] and I've broken lots of phones.
[4028.72 → 4029.88] There's an interesting perspective.
[4030.20 → 4031.12] That's a very good point.
[4031.28 → 4031.86] Build quality
[4031.86 → 4032.96] with custom firmware
[4032.96 → 4033.70] if it doesn't fit
[4033.70 → 4034.38] my needs stock.
[4034.56 → 4034.80] Alright.
[4035.18 → 4036.04] I have a Nexus 4.
[4036.60 → 4037.34] Isn't as amazing
[4037.34 → 4038.34] as the HTC One.
[4039.02 → 4040.02] Both sides glass
[4040.02 → 4040.72] still feels good.
[4040.84 → 4041.98] I prefer Nexus device.
[4042.54 → 4043.18] Hardware quality
[4043.18 → 4044.30] is way more important to Eric.
[4044.36 → 4045.04] So it looks like
[4045.04 → 4047.00] people are very divided
[4047.00 → 4047.78] on this issue.
[4048.32 → 4049.12] Very interesting.
[4049.12 → 4049.92] It really depends
[4049.92 → 4050.60] on what you do.
[4050.70 → 4051.44] Like the skater.
[4051.58 → 4052.06] That was actually
[4052.06 → 4052.96] one of my favourite comments.
[4053.14 → 4053.74] Great point.
[4053.94 → 4054.50] I'm a skater.
[4054.58 → 4055.12] I break phones.
[4055.26 → 4055.52] Okay.
[4055.56 → 4056.10] He's going to want
[4056.10 → 4056.88] to weigh more durable phones.
[4057.10 → 4057.86] Fantastic point.
[4057.94 → 4058.36] Makes sense.
[4058.68 → 4059.04] Conversation.
[4059.16 → 4059.52] What do you guys
[4059.52 → 4060.28] think about Bitcoins?
[4060.36 → 4060.86] We're actually going
[4060.86 → 4061.26] to be starting
[4061.26 → 4062.22] a Bitcoin mining pool
[4062.22 → 4062.66] on the forum
[4062.66 → 4063.18] at some point.
[4063.24 → 4063.82] So check it out.
[4064.16 → 4064.48] Maybe.
[4065.06 → 4065.42] Of course.
[4065.42 → 4065.64] That's getting
[4065.64 → 4066.60] more and more complicated.
[4066.88 → 4067.08] Okay.
[4067.28 → 4067.50] Okay.
[4067.50 → 4067.92] Maybe not.
[4068.28 → 4068.82] Andrew says
[4068.82 → 4069.94] of course build quality.
[4070.04 → 4071.34] Wants the device to last.
[4071.68 → 4072.46] At least if you don't
[4072.46 → 4073.54] get a software update
[4073.54 → 4075.38] the device might still work.
[4075.58 → 4075.68] Yes.
[4075.84 → 4076.28] But like.
[4076.28 → 4077.00] But you dropped
[4077.00 → 4078.12] your Nexus S all over
[4078.12 → 4078.44] the place.
[4078.86 → 4079.22] Tons.
[4079.62 → 4079.76] Okay.
[4079.76 → 4080.32] Like it wasn't
[4080.32 → 4081.60] bad build quality.
[4081.94 → 4082.80] It just wasn't like
[4082.80 → 4084.34] solid piece of aluminum.
[4084.74 → 4085.38] Dion says
[4085.38 → 4086.18] I'd go with software
[4086.18 → 4087.24] because better software
[4087.24 → 4088.34] means a better experience.
[4088.86 → 4090.30] Did Slick's S3 battery life
[4090.30 → 4091.04] drop significantly
[4091.04 → 4091.68] after he updated
[4091.68 → 4092.14] to Jelly Bean?
[4092.20 → 4092.94] You should talk about that.
[4093.04 → 4093.28] Yep.
[4093.84 → 4094.24] Definitely.
[4095.30 → 4096.44] And then your forum thing.
[4097.02 → 4097.70] And then my forum thing.
[4097.82 → 4098.02] Yeah.
[4098.12 → 4099.52] It dropped massively
[4099.52 → 4100.88] but it kind of came back.
[4101.70 → 4102.28] So tell.
[4102.28 → 4104.54] For about a week or two
[4104.54 → 4105.26] my brother and I
[4105.26 → 4105.96] both had a problem
[4105.96 → 4106.64] where the battery life
[4106.64 → 4107.16] on our S3
[4107.16 → 4109.16] just completely tanked.
[4109.38 → 4110.02] I have a screenshot
[4110.02 → 4110.84] of my battery app
[4110.84 → 4111.50] telling me I was at
[4111.50 → 4112.34] 20% battery life
[4112.34 → 4113.32] and I had five minutes left.
[4114.00 → 4115.02] And I was not
[4115.02 → 4116.24] super actively using my phone.
[4116.34 → 4117.98] So that was kind of nuts.
[4119.24 → 4120.50] But then it's just
[4120.50 → 4121.70] kind of fixed.
[4121.94 → 4122.84] So I'm not actually
[4122.84 → 4123.52] entirely sure
[4123.52 → 4124.46] what even happened.
[4124.46 → 4125.16] Well you were telling me
[4125.16 → 4125.88] the other day
[4125.88 → 4127.28] that it seems like
[4127.28 → 4128.32] when you charge it
[4128.32 → 4128.96] from the wall.
[4128.96 → 4129.60] When I charge it
[4129.60 → 4130.26] from the wall
[4130.26 → 4131.98] it actually seems to last
[4131.98 → 4133.58] at 100% charge
[4133.58 → 4134.30] on battery
[4134.30 → 4135.80] reading at 100%
[4135.80 → 4136.42] if I charge it
[4136.42 → 4137.54] from USB to my computer
[4137.54 → 4138.84] compared to USB to my wall
[4138.84 → 4140.14] USB from my computer
[4140.14 → 4141.24] it will last drastically
[4141.24 → 4142.34] less time
[4142.34 → 4143.48] than USB from the wall.
[4143.54 → 4143.94] So guys
[4143.94 → 4145.00] S3 users
[4145.00 → 4146.36] let us know
[4146.36 → 4147.88] if you've observed
[4147.88 → 4148.62] the same thing.
[4148.80 → 4150.12] Someone make a post
[4150.12 → 4150.58] on the forum.
[4150.84 → 4151.08] Yeah.
[4151.08 → 4152.42] Under mobile devices.
[4152.48 → 4153.06] Let's talk about this.
[4153.14 → 4153.46] Let's figure out
[4153.46 → 4153.86] what's going on.
[4154.00 → 4154.08] Yeah.
[4154.38 → 4155.34] Very, very bizarre.
[4156.42 → 4157.68] So speaking of the forum
[4157.68 → 4158.34] forum call out.
[4158.44 → 4158.56] Go.
[4158.56 → 4159.92] Okay so first off
[4159.92 → 4160.58] I want to thank
[4160.58 → 4161.58] all my people again
[4161.58 → 4162.48] Mr. Wizard
[4162.48 → 4163.36] for again
[4163.36 → 4164.28] making just
[4164.28 → 4165.16] everything happen.
[4165.28 → 4166.08] He's kind of a wizard.
[4166.28 → 4167.38] So Mr. Wizard
[4167.38 → 4169.16] if he doesn't already know
[4169.16 → 4170.78] is going to be getting
[4170.78 → 4172.14] some kind of beast
[4172.14 → 4173.08] gaming rig
[4173.08 → 4174.24] sometime in the next
[4174.24 → 4175.10] couple months here
[4175.10 → 4176.54] for all the contribution
[4176.54 → 4177.12] he's made.
[4177.30 → 4178.12] We're going to hook him up
[4178.12 → 4178.82] with a NAS
[4178.82 → 4180.16] that's going to have
[4180.16 → 4181.08] RAID 5 backup.
[4181.26 → 4182.02] I don't think you've told
[4182.02 → 4183.06] him this yet, have you?
[4183.26 → 4183.50] Nope.
[4183.62 → 4184.30] Okay we're going to be
[4184.30 → 4185.36] hooking him up with a NAS
[4185.36 → 4185.96] that's going to have
[4185.96 → 4186.88] RAID 5 backup
[4186.88 → 4187.58] because right now
[4187.58 → 4188.32] he's using like
[4188.32 → 4189.74] 10 ghetto
[4189.74 → 4191.54] like couple hundred
[4191.54 → 4192.52] gig hard drives.
[4192.74 → 4193.48] He cut a hole
[4193.48 → 4194.96] in part of his case
[4194.96 → 4196.48] and then bent the metal
[4196.48 → 4197.30] back so that he could
[4197.30 → 4198.16] shove a hard drive
[4198.16 → 4198.44] in there
[4198.44 → 4199.98] and then right now
[4199.98 → 4201.28] he has the hard drive
[4201.28 → 4203.06] cages outside his case
[4203.06 → 4203.44] because they don't
[4203.44 → 4204.22] properly fit with
[4204.22 → 4204.82] some of his hardware
[4204.82 → 4205.50] so he's like running
[4205.50 → 4206.42] long SATA cables
[4206.42 → 4207.16] into his case.
[4207.16 → 4208.04] Totally unacceptable
[4208.04 → 4209.44] for someone who's
[4209.44 → 4210.52] contributed that much
[4210.52 → 4211.42] to the Linus Tech Tips
[4211.42 → 4211.62] forum.
[4211.72 → 4212.46] I mean the hours
[4212.46 → 4213.08] he's put in are
[4213.08 → 4213.66] countless.
[4214.00 → 4214.90] Like days and days
[4214.90 → 4215.48] days and days
[4215.48 → 4215.98] and days
[4215.98 → 4216.00] and days.
[4216.10 → 4216.66] We haven't paid
[4216.66 → 4217.14] him a penny.
[4217.40 → 4218.28] And he dealt with
[4218.28 → 4219.26] not to hate on
[4219.26 → 4219.94] Bulletin now that
[4219.94 → 4220.80] they've given us a
[4220.80 → 4221.98] refund, but he dealt
[4221.98 → 4222.76] with Bulletin
[4222.76 → 4224.12] which was nuts.
[4224.28 → 4224.34] Yeah.
[4224.74 → 4225.42] So we already
[4225.42 → 4226.10] hooked him up with a
[4226.10 → 4227.12] 590, but we're going
[4227.12 → 4227.90] to be following that
[4227.90 → 4228.66] up with a full
[4228.66 → 4230.10] gaming rig at some
[4230.10 → 4230.90] point here in the
[4230.90 → 4231.42] near future.
[4231.42 → 4233.34] So thank you, Mr. Wizard
[4233.34 → 4234.46] because we're doing
[4234.46 → 4235.82] amazing things now.
[4236.66 → 4237.64] IPS is awesome.
[4237.76 → 4238.40] Everything's awesome.
[4238.50 → 4239.20] Thank you Mod Team
[4239.20 → 4240.08] for sticking with us.
[4240.66 → 4241.84] Thank you to all the
[4241.84 → 4242.76] members of the forum
[4242.76 → 4243.52] and the Mod Team
[4243.52 → 4244.50] and Mr. Wizard again
[4244.50 → 4245.72] for sticking with us
[4245.72 → 4246.38] through these crazy
[4246.38 → 4247.14] downtimes we've been
[4247.14 → 4247.64] having in the last
[4247.64 → 4248.00] little while.
[4248.32 → 4248.92] We're rolling out a
[4248.92 → 4249.44] solution that will
[4249.44 → 4250.50] hopefully fix it but
[4250.50 → 4251.40] we'll talk about that
[4251.40 → 4252.64] more maybe next
[4252.64 → 4253.14] live stream.
[4253.22 → 4253.98] Yeah next live stream.
[4254.18 → 4254.46] Not yet.
[4255.60 → 4256.72] And I want to do
[4256.72 → 4257.62] brink and folding
[4257.62 → 4258.68] call-outs real quick.
[4258.96 → 4259.22] Sure.
[4259.22 → 4263.06] So brink our world
[4263.06 → 4265.70] rating is 1076 out of
[4265.70 → 4267.08] almost 100,000 teams
[4267.08 → 4268.28] and we climb about
[4268.28 → 4269.40] 10 places a day so
[4269.40 → 4269.94] we're doing great
[4269.94 → 4270.26] there.
[4270.96 → 4272.34] Our Canadian ranking
[4272.34 → 4274.40] is 42 out of almost
[4274.40 → 4275.46] 2,200 teams.
[4275.62 → 4275.90] Wow.
[4276.08 → 4276.62] So we're doing pretty
[4276.62 → 4277.50] great there as well.
[4278.46 → 4280.86] A big thanks to Ryan
[4280.86 → 4282.48] L. Booth from the
[4282.48 → 4283.52] brink team captain
[4283.52 → 4284.26] because he's been
[4284.26 → 4285.00] doing awesome and
[4285.00 → 4285.66] contributing a ton.
[4286.12 → 4287.30] At this pace in about
[4287.30 → 4288.02] three and a half months
[4288.02 → 4289.02] we should be 13th
[4289.02 → 4290.04] place in Canada and
[4290.04 → 4291.14] 550th in the world.
[4291.72 → 4292.58] So brink's doing
[4292.58 → 4294.04] just awesome.
[4294.60 → 4295.34] I had a folding
[4295.34 → 4296.50] update somewhere but
[4296.50 → 4296.98] I don't remember
[4296.98 → 4298.54] where it is.
[4298.76 → 4299.46] By the way there's a
[4299.46 → 4300.06] shout out from the
[4300.06 → 4300.88] brink team to the
[4300.88 → 4302.20] folding team as a
[4302.20 → 4303.20] like thank you for
[4303.20 → 4303.92] being awesome and
[4303.92 → 4305.20] contributing your
[4305.20 → 4306.32] gigahertz to a good
[4306.32 → 4306.70] cause.
[4307.98 → 4308.84] More gigahertz.
[4309.38 → 4310.40] Hopefully Whaler can
[4310.40 → 4311.66] throw me a folding
[4311.66 → 4312.62] update here because I
[4312.62 → 4313.16] don't remember what it
[4313.16 → 4313.58] actually said.
[4313.58 → 4314.14] Well I can move on.
[4314.24 → 4315.10] I have lots of topics
[4315.10 → 4316.06] to move on to.
[4316.06 → 4318.16] AMD has slashed
[4318.16 → 4320.02] prices on CPUs and
[4320.02 → 4320.58] Apus.
[4320.66 → 4321.44] They also launched a
[4321.44 → 4322.18] couple products.
[4322.72 → 4323.58] So check this out.
[4324.14 → 4326.68] You can get an A6 3600
[4326.68 → 4328.00] which is a quad-core
[4328.00 → 4328.98] APU.
[4329.14 → 4330.06] That's a quad-core
[4330.06 → 4330.44] isn't it?
[4330.54 → 4330.86] I think so.
[4331.00 → 4331.50] I think so.
[4331.86 → 4333.22] Which is basically
[4333.22 → 4334.22] okay let's look at the
[4334.22 → 4335.66] A8 3800 because that
[4335.66 → 4338.30] is a decent CPU for
[4338.30 → 4339.62] under a hundred bucks
[4339.62 → 4340.92] with a decent
[4340.92 → 4341.80] onboard GPU.
[4341.80 → 4344.20] Even the A8 5600K
[4344.20 → 4344.90] check that out.
[4345.18 → 4346.06] Under a hundred
[4346.06 → 4346.58] dollars.
[4346.98 → 4347.90] That's probably the
[4347.90 → 4348.96] one that I should have
[4348.96 → 4349.78] talked about first
[4349.78 → 4351.40] because that is crazy.
[4351.52 → 4352.28] That's an unlocked
[4352.28 → 4353.32] chip so you can
[4353.32 → 4354.02] overclock it.
[4354.26 → 4355.26] It comes with the
[4355.26 → 4357.14] best onboard graphics
[4357.14 → 4358.24] that you can get
[4358.24 → 4359.34] other than I think
[4359.34 → 4360.48] the A10 is clocked a
[4360.48 → 4361.30] little bit higher but
[4361.30 → 4362.46] it's basically there
[4362.46 → 4364.70] and I mean quite
[4364.70 → 4366.46] frankly I mean in our
[4366.46 → 4367.66] testing where we went
[4367.66 → 4370.02] 8350 versus 3570K.
[4370.02 → 4371.64] Did you ever feel
[4371.64 → 4372.98] like the 8350 was
[4372.98 → 4374.04] holding back your
[4374.04 → 4374.96] gaming experience in
[4374.96 → 4375.60] some tangible way?
[4375.68 → 4376.06] Not really.
[4376.58 → 4378.72] So yes the 3570K
[4378.72 → 4379.46] benchmark is better.
[4379.62 → 4380.22] It's faster.
[4380.86 → 4381.38] And you know what
[4381.38 → 4382.70] quite frankly I prefer
[4382.70 → 4383.96] Intel platforms because
[4383.96 → 4385.26] I find I have fewer
[4385.26 → 4387.22] sort of random driver
[4387.22 → 4388.04] issues whether it's
[4388.04 → 4389.12] with a SATA driver when
[4389.12 → 4390.04] I swap out a bunch of
[4390.04 → 4390.30] stuff.
[4390.42 → 4392.32] I love rapid storage
[4392.32 → 4392.76] tech.
[4394.46 → 4396.94] Intel's like SATA
[4396.94 → 4397.88] AHCI manager.
[4398.08 → 4398.72] It's amazing.
[4399.10 → 4400.00] Makes my life better
[4400.00 → 4400.08] computer.
[4400.66 → 4402.26] I use Intel platforms.
[4402.38 → 4402.98] I prefer them.
[4403.34 → 4405.12] With that said when
[4405.12 → 4405.84] we're talking about
[4405.84 → 4408.98] $100 for a chip and a
[4408.98 → 4411.00] cheap FM2 board that
[4411.00 → 4412.92] will basically get you a
[4412.92 → 4414.10] platform upgrade for
[4414.10 → 4415.58] probably $200 if you buy
[4415.58 → 4417.30] yourself like 4 to 8
[4417.30 → 4418.64] gigs of RAM, a cheap
[4418.64 → 4420.04] board and an A8.
[4420.92 → 4421.78] And honestly.
[4421.88 → 4422.88] Why buy a console?
[4423.50 → 4424.52] The driver thing which
[4424.52 → 4425.36] you and I have both
[4425.36 → 4426.86] brought up off-screen
[4426.86 → 4427.32] before.
[4427.32 → 4429.38] But AMD has been making
[4429.38 → 4430.42] leaps and bounds in the
[4430.42 → 4430.86] driver field.
[4431.02 → 4431.38] True that.
[4431.74 → 4433.94] And the better driver
[4433.94 → 4435.00] assumption for Intel?
[4435.20 → 4436.48] I'm not talking graphics.
[4437.06 → 4437.26] No.
[4437.54 → 4438.50] So if you're using
[4438.50 → 4440.90] onboard graphics, AMD
[4440.90 → 4442.10] gets the nod there for
[4442.10 → 4442.54] sure.
[4442.80 → 4443.26] I mean how much
[4443.26 → 4444.24] experience do they have
[4444.24 → 4445.28] compared to Intel when it
[4445.28 → 4445.90] comes to gaming?
[4446.46 → 4447.66] And to jump in line with
[4447.66 → 4448.72] the comment right below
[4448.72 → 4449.72] this post, actually.
[4450.00 → 4450.20] Yep.
[4450.20 → 4451.82] He's talking about how
[4451.82 → 4452.84] especially like I don't
[4452.84 → 4453.26] know if he actually
[4453.26 → 4454.46] brings this up exactly
[4454.46 → 4455.20] but especially with
[4455.20 → 4456.28] next gen consoles coming
[4456.28 → 4457.90] out instead of rebuying
[4457.90 → 4459.80] your whole setup it
[4459.80 → 4461.74] might be at these prices
[4461.74 → 4463.96] to move to gaming PCs.
[4464.08 → 4464.68] I mean they've got the
[4464.68 → 4466.68] FX8320 which is an
[4466.68 → 4467.56] unlocked chip.
[4467.98 → 4468.76] There's pretty much once
[4468.76 → 4469.48] you overclock them
[4469.48 → 4470.82] pretty much no performance
[4470.82 → 4471.96] disadvantage compared to
[4471.96 → 4472.70] an 8350.
[4472.76 → 4474.66] That's an 8 core and the
[4474.66 → 4476.22] wholesaler bulk pricing is
[4476.22 → 4477.28] $153.
[4477.28 → 4479.28] I mean this is like
[4479.28 → 4480.20] just earth-shattering
[4480.20 → 4480.62] stuff.
[4480.78 → 4481.32] It's awesome.
[4482.60 → 4483.52] So go AMD.
[4484.06 → 4484.96] I don't know if you guys
[4484.96 → 4486.08] saw this but AMD's
[4486.08 → 4487.14] stock price has gone
[4487.14 → 4487.62] like this.
[4488.18 → 4489.18] So between some of the
[4489.18 → 4489.98] new people they've been
[4489.98 → 4491.64] acquiring, between them
[4491.64 → 4492.52] beating their projections,
[4492.74 → 4493.46] between them being the
[4493.46 → 4495.20] technology powering both
[4495.20 → 4496.90] major upcoming consoles
[4496.90 → 4497.94] well all three there the
[4497.94 → 4499.46] GPU and the Wii U for
[4499.46 → 4499.82] that matter.
[4499.96 → 4500.82] I mean I said major
[4500.82 → 4501.28] consoles.
[4501.50 → 4502.44] Was that a slate at
[4502.44 → 4502.88] Nintendo?
[4503.60 → 4504.34] I love Nintendo.
[4504.50 → 4505.58] I'm not going to beat up
[4505.58 → 4507.02] on them but if EA developed
[4507.02 → 4507.84] a game for a Nintendo
[4507.84 → 4509.10] platform then I'd still
[4509.10 → 4509.74] go after that.
[4509.94 → 4511.02] So that's the line for
[4511.02 → 4511.22] me.
[4513.04 → 4514.88] But AMD's powering all
[4514.88 → 4516.22] that, so AMD's stock has
[4516.22 → 4518.40] just exploded which
[4518.40 → 4519.62] means hopefully a little
[4519.62 → 4523.70] bit more room to breathe.
[4524.46 → 4525.38] They've been struggling.
[4525.88 → 4527.08] For a little while there
[4527.08 → 4527.72] it was terrifying.
[4527.72 → 4528.82] It was looking like it
[4528.82 → 4530.32] might be game over.
[4530.56 → 4530.84] Yeah.
[4531.30 → 4531.70] Which.
[4532.48 → 4533.90] Like pretty bad.
[4533.90 → 4534.62] Like I don't know what a
[4534.62 → 4535.88] game over AMD would look
[4535.88 → 4537.40] like whether it's selling
[4537.40 → 4538.74] all the patents or whether
[4538.74 → 4540.22] it's acquisition or like
[4540.22 → 4541.18] who knows.
[4541.66 → 4542.34] Something terrible.
[4542.48 → 4543.42] But it was looking like
[4543.42 → 4545.02] just terrible
[4545.02 → 4546.22] things were going to
[4546.22 → 4547.22] happen so that's really
[4547.22 → 4547.62] exciting.
[4548.34 → 4549.88] I'm going to jump back a
[4549.88 → 4550.72] little bit just to do the
[4550.72 → 4551.60] folding team call out.
[4551.92 → 4552.74] So our current rank
[4552.74 → 4555.68] worldwide is 212 which is
[4555.68 → 4556.10] insane.
[4556.72 → 4556.82] We have.
[4556.82 → 4557.78] Fist bump to everyone
[4557.78 → 4558.50] who's a member of the
[4558.50 → 4559.46] folding team you guys.
[4559.46 → 4562.02] We have 499 users which
[4562.02 → 4562.58] is insane.
[4563.22 → 4565.28] And for all time
[4565.28 → 4567.96] or OK for all folding
[4567.96 → 4568.78] teams currently.
[4568.98 → 4569.20] Yeah.
[4569.40 → 4571.20] We have we're placed 15th
[4571.20 → 4572.26] for active folders.
[4573.02 → 4573.58] Wow.
[4573.66 → 4575.00] Which is nuts.
[4575.82 → 4576.76] That's crazy.
[4576.90 → 4577.76] There's a lot of.
[4577.88 → 4578.28] That's actually insane.
[4578.42 → 4579.30] There's a lot of folding
[4579.30 → 4579.94] teams that have been
[4579.94 → 4581.04] around a lot longer than
[4581.04 → 4581.38] us.
[4581.96 → 4583.76] So to be ranked 15th for
[4583.76 → 4584.80] active folders is just
[4584.80 → 4586.30] actually insane.
[4586.70 → 4587.88] So that's very cool.
[4587.98 → 4588.56] Good job everyone.
[4588.56 → 4590.38] I think I had left
[4590.38 → 4590.84] another.
[4591.40 → 4592.40] I think I had left
[4592.40 → 4593.60] another question for the
[4593.60 → 4594.10] Twitter folks.
[4594.18 → 4594.72] Do you remember what it
[4594.72 → 4595.00] was.
[4595.92 → 4596.12] OK.
[4596.26 → 4597.08] Console players apparently
[4597.08 → 4597.70] don't want to build
[4597.70 → 4598.06] PCs.
[4598.22 → 4598.90] Well we should educate
[4598.90 → 4599.18] them.
[4599.70 → 4600.06] 4 p.m.
[4600.08 → 4601.44] Time slot sucks for guys
[4601.44 → 4602.28] in our time zone
[4602.28 → 4603.84] ironically but sorry guys
[4603.84 → 4604.96] we got to do what we
[4604.96 → 4605.44] got to do.
[4605.90 → 4606.44] Apparently we're number
[4606.44 → 4607.38] 41 in Canada.
[4607.54 → 4607.70] Cool.
[4607.80 → 4608.46] You said 42.
[4608.78 → 4609.44] Well that yeah.
[4609.76 → 4610.26] There you go.
[4610.36 → 4612.16] That was from a while
[4612.16 → 4612.40] ago.
[4612.60 → 4613.68] A quarterly pimp my rig
[4613.68 → 4614.64] for forum members.
[4615.26 → 4616.08] You know what I would
[4616.08 → 4616.94] like to do is I'd like
[4616.94 → 4617.92] to do more like.
[4618.56 → 4619.66] More giveaways at some
[4619.66 → 4619.92] point.
[4620.16 → 4620.96] But we got to figure out
[4620.96 → 4621.72] the logistics because
[4621.72 → 4622.60] there are a lot of laws
[4622.60 → 4623.50] involved that we've just
[4623.50 → 4624.18] kind of ignored.
[4624.68 → 4625.72] But Linus Media Group's
[4625.72 → 4627.00] an actual company now not
[4627.00 → 4628.00] just some dude with a
[4628.00 → 4628.60] YouTube channel.
[4629.18 → 4632.02] So we have to be we have
[4632.02 → 4632.48] to be careful.
[4632.62 → 4633.70] The last thing I want is
[4633.70 → 4635.08] to run across Canadian
[4635.08 → 4636.40] gaming laws which would
[4636.40 → 4637.98] shut down my company like
[4637.98 → 4638.44] that.
[4638.60 → 4639.92] If they're like oh you're
[4639.92 → 4640.52] running a lottery.
[4641.22 → 4643.50] Therefore you are this
[4643.50 → 4644.46] this and this they could
[4644.46 → 4645.34] take everything.
[4645.34 → 4646.00] Yeah.
[4646.14 → 4647.18] So I got to be careful
[4647.18 → 4647.52] guys.
[4648.02 → 4648.96] There's and there's more
[4648.96 → 4650.06] to it than just Linus
[4650.06 → 4650.74] doesn't want to give
[4650.74 → 4651.28] things away.
[4651.74 → 4652.68] Just to be clear.
[4653.14 → 4653.30] Yeah.
[4654.06 → 4654.46] OK.
[4654.70 → 4656.06] So according to what
[4656.06 → 4656.86] would be something I'd
[4656.86 → 4657.78] watch the live stream but
[4657.78 → 4658.42] I'm out skiing.
[4658.84 → 4659.58] Try and get them to send
[4659.58 → 4660.54] you a free 4k TV.
[4660.66 → 4660.98] Oh yeah.
[4661.06 → 4661.82] I asked them if they
[4661.82 → 4662.84] wanted us to do deals.
[4663.72 → 4665.08] I joined the forums just
[4665.08 → 4665.84] because you said so.
[4665.94 → 4666.34] Yes.
[4666.90 → 4667.62] Thank you.
[4668.04 → 4669.18] Just because we said so.
[4669.24 → 4670.36] He joined the forums and
[4670.36 → 4671.54] joined Twitter just to say
[4671.54 → 4671.86] this.
[4671.98 → 4672.26] Nice.
[4672.36 → 4672.98] Thank you guys.
[4672.98 → 4674.46] I mean it drives me crazy
[4674.46 → 4675.66] when people are like I
[4675.66 → 4676.48] know it says on your
[4676.48 → 4677.62] Facebook not to send you
[4677.62 → 4678.98] messages here, but I don't
[4678.98 → 4680.80] have Twitter, so I sent you
[4680.80 → 4681.26] this message.
[4681.38 → 4683.40] It's like Twitter's free.
[4684.02 → 4685.10] You don't have to do
[4685.10 → 4686.00] anything other than just
[4686.00 → 4686.92] send me a message on it.
[4686.98 → 4688.04] Like I'm not asking you to
[4688.04 → 4688.54] marry it.
[4688.82 → 4690.24] It's just that I can't
[4690.24 → 4692.10] handle monitoring my
[4692.10 → 4693.42] private messages and my
[4693.42 → 4694.68] emails and my Facebook and
[4694.68 → 4695.76] my Twitter and actually
[4695.76 → 4696.90] making videos which is
[4696.90 → 4698.94] priority number one is
[4698.94 → 4700.22] actually making videos
[4700.22 → 4701.60] not talking about videos.
[4701.60 → 4705.06] look in the meme topic
[4705.06 → 4706.20] more EA stuff on the
[4706.20 → 4706.62] page.
[4706.78 → 4707.36] Okay there we go.
[4707.86 → 4708.60] Okay apparently
[4708.60 → 4710.02] apparently Twitter really
[4710.02 → 4711.00] didn't have much to say
[4711.00 → 4711.52] about that.
[4712.24 → 4713.36] So there you go.
[4713.66 → 4714.26] It's going to be hard to
[4714.26 → 4715.34] offer deals that satisfy
[4715.34 → 4715.90] all territories.
[4716.02 → 4716.46] That's true.
[4716.86 → 4718.06] Although sites like Amazon
[4718.06 → 4718.90] might be an exception.
[4719.20 → 4719.72] There are a lot of
[4719.72 → 4720.68] territories will be able to
[4720.68 → 4721.20] get a benefit.
[4722.60 → 4724.04] Slick's Blackberry Z10
[4724.04 → 4724.94] thing will be coming up
[4724.94 → 4725.68] either tonight or
[4725.68 → 4726.02] tomorrow.
[4726.36 → 4728.64] So guys stay tuned.
[4729.26 → 4730.12] And apparently Logan's
[4730.12 → 4731.12] been doing something similar
[4731.12 → 4732.12] with games on deals.
[4732.48 → 4732.66] Cool.
[4733.04 → 4734.04] Do you want to handle our
[4734.04 → 4734.60] rigs of the week?
[4735.64 → 4736.74] I actually haven't looked
[4736.74 → 4738.52] at these enough but this
[4738.52 → 4739.04] will be kind of
[4739.04 → 4740.12] I was working with the
[4740.12 → 4740.34] security stuff.
[4740.34 → 4741.74] Then I'm up then.
[4741.90 → 4743.48] I'll do this one.
[4743.50 → 4744.42] Well we should do rigs of
[4744.42 → 4744.60] the week.
[4744.82 → 4745.56] Yeah yeah but I can do
[4745.56 → 4746.28] this to solve for some
[4746.28 → 4746.70] time for you.
[4746.88 → 4747.26] Oh okay.
[4747.40 → 4748.64] Okay so check this out
[4748.64 → 4748.98] guys.
[4749.62 → 4750.98] Apparently and this was
[4750.98 → 4752.88] posted by Mr. X on the
[4752.88 → 4753.24] forums.
[4753.40 → 4754.40] Thank you, Mr. X.
[4755.20 → 4756.46] There's a big Intel logo at
[4756.46 → 4756.82] the top.
[4757.30 → 4758.54] PC enthusiast.
[4758.66 → 4759.12] Top PC.
[4759.98 → 4760.98] Top PC I guess.
[4761.12 → 4762.16] But the capitalization is a
[4762.16 → 4762.48] little funny.
[4762.48 → 4764.02] With Coolowler.com.
[4764.08 → 4765.48] These guys leak everything
[4765.48 → 4766.86] because they get access to
[4766.86 → 4768.18] all the good stuff.
[4768.52 → 4770.76] Has apparently leaked a
[4770.76 → 4772.94] Core i7 Ivy Bridge E.
[4773.22 → 4775.86] So this is a multicore more
[4775.86 → 4777.48] than four core Ivy Bridge
[4777.48 → 4778.44] based chip that will be
[4778.44 → 4780.08] coming around coming at some
[4780.08 → 4781.64] point based on that there's
[4781.64 → 4782.96] already benchmarks.
[4783.40 → 4784.78] Couldn't be that far off.
[4784.78 → 4789.54] And so this is a 4960X and this
[4789.54 → 4792.98] will be replacing the 3970X I
[4792.98 → 4794.36] guess at that thousand dollar
[4794.36 → 4796.74] price point on the enthusiast X79
[4796.74 → 4797.42] platform.
[4797.74 → 4799.96] So remember guys X79 is not
[4799.96 → 4800.56] going away.
[4800.88 → 4801.90] It's still going to be the
[4801.90 → 4803.40] enthusiast grade platform with
[4803.40 → 4806.12] support for dual 16X PCI Express
[4806.12 → 4809.90] lanes, more RAM, more cores, all
[4809.90 → 4811.78] that stuff is not going away.
[4812.22 → 4815.02] So pretty much the summary is
[4815.02 → 4816.98] it's 10% faster than the
[4816.98 → 4818.94] Sandy Bridge E based chips
[4818.94 → 4824.02] which is if we sort of know
[4824.02 → 4826.88] anything about CPUs and sort of
[4826.88 → 4829.38] anything then we probably saw
[4829.38 → 4829.98] this one coming.
[4831.26 → 4833.12] So there you have it.
[4833.24 → 4835.70] Ivy Bridge E just like Ivy Bridge
[4835.70 → 4837.06] was compared to Sandy Bridge is
[4837.06 → 4838.10] about 10% better.
[4838.46 → 4840.10] You can see the overclock that
[4840.10 → 4841.02] they've got going on.
[4841.06 → 4842.52] So it's a 3.5 gigahertz
[4842.52 → 4845.38] overclock on what appears to be
[4845.38 → 4846.48] let's see how many physical
[4846.48 → 4847.52] cores we got here.
[4849.00 → 4849.66] I don't even.
[4849.82 → 4849.96] Yeah.
[4850.04 → 4850.66] So there you go.
[4850.74 → 4852.94] Six cores, 12 threads, 3.3
[4852.94 → 4854.28] gigahertz stock frequency.
[4854.84 → 4856.26] Linus Tech Tips takes no
[4856.26 → 4856.74] responsibility.
[4856.92 → 4858.28] You got their watermark all over
[4858.28 → 4858.38] it.
[4858.44 → 4859.58] We did not run these numbers.
[4859.94 → 4861.84] We don't have an Ivy Bridge E.
[4862.18 → 4863.38] Apparently there's going to be an
[4863.38 → 4865.96] X79 AGD45 Plus board that'll
[4865.96 → 4866.36] support.
[4867.10 → 4869.82] Looks like the chipset is picking
[4869.82 → 4872.08] up as Sandy Bridge E, Southbridge
[4872.08 → 4872.56] X79.
[4872.88 → 4874.66] So a lot of this data may not be
[4874.66 → 4876.00] correct but there you have it.
[4876.96 → 4878.40] It's coming at some point guys.
[4879.46 → 4880.76] So that was pretty cool that I
[4880.76 → 4882.26] picked up on the forum.
[4882.34 → 4883.80] Big thanks for posting that on the
[4883.80 → 4884.02] forum.
[4884.42 → 4885.70] Here's another Linus Tech Tips
[4885.70 → 4886.92] forum news topic.
[4887.26 → 4889.20] This one was posted by Joe Z,
[4889.44 → 4891.02] Joe Kai, Joe Kai as well.
[4891.02 → 4893.58] So LG is launching the world's
[4893.58 → 4898.28] first 55 inch curved OLED HDTV.
[4898.64 → 4901.30] So this isn't going to be 4K.
[4901.80 → 4903.16] This is an HDTV.
[4903.48 → 4906.60] It is 4.3 millimetres thick.
[4906.96 → 4910.34] So guys if you look at, yeah, here
[4910.34 → 4911.90] I'm just going to zoom in on this so
[4911.90 → 4913.36] you guys can get a better look at it.
[4913.36 → 4917.16] But that thinness, holy crap.
[4919.46 → 4921.14] OLED emits its own light.
[4921.54 → 4922.98] So what you guys got to remember is
[4922.98 → 4924.80] you don't have to build a backlight
[4924.80 → 4926.60] array that goes behind the panel
[4926.60 → 4926.98] anymore.
[4927.24 → 4929.30] So the light emitting is done by the
[4929.30 → 4930.30] panel itself.
[4930.40 → 4932.62] In fact we did a demo at CES where I
[4932.62 → 4934.28] was standing in front of a TV that
[4934.28 → 4936.70] was sideways, and then we shifted the
[4936.70 → 4938.50] angle so you could actually see the
[4938.50 → 4940.26] TV because you could hardly even see it
[4940.26 → 4940.76] in the shot.
[4940.76 → 4942.98] So this isn't going to be cheap.
[4943.36 → 4945.34] I think the initial quote is something
[4945.34 → 4949.26] like 13 grand, 13,500, and it'll be
[4949.26 → 4952.60] available at 1,400 retail locations.
[4953.58 → 4955.68] Pre-orders are apparently started already.
[4955.80 → 4958.24] So the curvature gives you more of that
[4958.24 → 4961.06] IMAX experience and the fact that all
[4961.06 → 4963.04] of the screen is equal distance away
[4963.04 → 4965.22] from your eyes in theory should make
[4965.22 → 4967.48] for a more natural viewing experience.
[4967.60 → 4970.06] However it remains to be seen if content
[4970.06 → 4971.56] that was developed with the intention
[4971.56 → 4973.84] of being watched on a flat screen is
[4973.84 → 4975.66] actually going to even benefit from a
[4975.66 → 4976.16] curved screen.
[4976.42 → 4978.50] Hey B-roll, what's your take on the
[4978.50 → 4979.72] whole curved screen thing?
[4980.86 → 4982.58] I think it's really stupid.
[4983.06 → 4985.02] Well I understand like it can help
[4985.02 → 4985.66] viewing angle.
[4986.16 → 4987.70] Okay so better for viewing angle.
[4987.78 → 4989.46] Mind you OLED doesn't really have that
[4989.46 → 4989.80] problem.
[4989.90 → 4990.60] Yeah it doesn't have that problem.
[4990.70 → 4992.48] B-roll the intern is actually over
[4992.48 → 4992.70] there.
[4992.76 → 4994.12] He's been editing videos the whole time
[4994.12 → 4994.82] we've been doing this.
[4995.72 → 4996.48] I don't know.
[4996.58 → 4997.52] It seems like a gimmick to me.
[4997.62 → 4998.68] I don't know.
[4998.68 → 5000.22] I don't know enough about it to see the
[5000.22 → 5000.76] full benefit.
[5000.98 → 5002.36] But I have to wait until you see it at least.
[5002.40 → 5003.62] I have to see it.
[5003.74 → 5004.90] Wait and see from B-roll.
[5005.02 → 5006.62] He's kind of our, when it comes to
[5006.62 → 5010.20] camera gear and high definition content
[5010.20 → 5012.16] gear and all that stuff, he's our
[5012.16 → 5013.06] resident expert.
[5013.50 → 5014.92] Whereas Diesel the intern is our
[5014.92 → 5016.76] post-processing wizard.
[5017.58 → 5019.24] Not to take anything away from Mr.
[5019.32 → 5022.84] Wizard but yeah Diesel the intern is
[5022.84 → 5024.76] kind of doctor wizard when it comes to
[5024.76 → 5026.28] some of the stuff he does with video
[5026.28 → 5026.88] is amazing.
[5027.52 → 5029.94] So they can both be just wizards as far
[5029.94 → 5030.58] as I'm concerned.
[5031.42 → 5032.88] There's one more thing I wanted to talk
[5032.88 → 5034.34] about very briefly just because I think
[5034.34 → 5034.84] it's hilarious.
[5035.04 → 5036.66] This was also posted by Josie.
[5037.10 → 5039.18] However once again Josie this is kind of
[5039.18 → 5039.96] directed at you.
[5040.46 → 5042.16] Man make sure you're posting some of your
[5042.16 → 5043.78] own original stuff in these threads
[5043.78 → 5045.88] because otherwise we become one of those
[5045.88 → 5047.44] one of those butthead sites.
[5048.04 → 5051.88] So this is kind of weird.
[5052.00 → 5055.44] This is the buddy cup which allows you
[5055.44 → 5058.32] to add friends to Facebook by bumping
[5058.32 → 5059.10] glasses with them.
[5060.38 → 5062.68] So this isn't the kind of thing that
[5062.68 → 5065.30] anyone really expects you to buy I don't
[5065.30 → 5065.66] think.
[5066.08 → 5068.48] The original link was from Engadget just
[5068.48 → 5069.18] so you guys know.
[5069.30 → 5070.60] So we're quoting a source.
[5071.18 → 5072.54] Oh yeah and the original link for the
[5072.54 → 5074.34] LG Curve TVs was also Engadget.
[5074.34 → 5076.96] So this is the kind of thing that they'd
[5076.96 → 5080.92] expect to be more like at an event where
[5080.92 → 5083.14] you meet people whether it's at a concert
[5083.14 → 5085.30] or whether it's at I don't know a hockey
[5085.30 → 5087.62] game or something like that where you meet
[5087.62 → 5089.18] someone and you kind of go yeah let's friend
[5089.18 → 5090.00] each other on Facebook.
[5090.40 → 5090.64] Boom.
[5091.14 → 5093.42] I mean does this just make the Facebook
[5093.42 → 5095.44] friend process that much more meaningless?
[5096.04 → 5096.20] Yep.
[5096.72 → 5097.90] I don't like it at all.
[5098.72 → 5099.18] I don't know.
[5099.24 → 5100.24] But you don't use Facebook.
[5100.56 → 5100.74] No.
[5100.74 → 5103.24] So you already don't like it before I even
[5103.24 → 5104.06] talk about a glass.
[5104.06 → 5105.28] I guess that makes it not fair.
[5107.62 → 5108.34] I don't know.
[5108.46 → 5110.12] I kind of see its use in some situations
[5110.12 → 5112.46] but I also see it being abused by like
[5112.46 → 5114.06] that guy that you don't actually even like.
[5114.18 → 5114.84] That's creepy.
[5115.08 → 5115.52] Buddy me.
[5115.62 → 5115.80] Yeah.
[5116.18 → 5116.40] Yeah.
[5116.74 → 5118.26] Or like walk up to your glass, and they're like
[5118.26 → 5119.10] Just like hit it.
[5119.50 → 5121.18] And it's like well okay I don't want that
[5121.18 → 5121.54] to happen.
[5121.64 → 5123.80] I don't want to like to put my cup down while
[5123.80 → 5125.30] I'm talking to someone and have ten people
[5125.30 → 5125.78] come by.
[5125.88 → 5127.78] And like rub their cups against you.
[5127.78 → 5129.90] I don't know.
[5130.12 → 5132.00] But then I could also see the application
[5132.00 → 5133.44] where if you're just out hanging
[5133.44 → 5135.28] and you genuinely meet someone that's pretty
[5135.28 → 5137.72] cool it's really easy to just be like
[5137.72 → 5138.12] go bunk.
[5138.38 → 5140.48] But then if you have smartphones with NFC.
[5141.48 → 5142.08] Go bunk.
[5143.72 → 5144.38] I don't know.
[5144.54 → 5146.44] I don't really see the awesome appeal.
[5146.70 → 5147.50] It's kind of cool.
[5147.64 → 5148.28] I mean it's.
[5148.56 → 5149.50] Like it's kind of.
[5149.62 → 5150.22] It's interesting.
[5150.38 → 5152.00] It's one of those like oh cool application
[5152.00 → 5152.56] of technology.
[5152.68 → 5153.34] I didn't think of it.
[5153.54 → 5156.16] And like if you went to a some event
[5156.16 → 5157.96] and they had it there it would probably
[5157.96 → 5158.68] be really cool.
[5158.82 → 5159.40] As a novelty.
[5159.70 → 5160.52] As a novelty thing.
[5160.52 → 5161.14] Or whatever.
[5161.34 → 5162.84] So like I'm not actually against it.
[5162.90 → 5163.14] I just.
[5163.32 → 5164.94] I personally wouldn't be too into it.
[5164.98 → 5165.66] But then again.
[5165.94 → 5166.22] Okay.
[5166.32 → 5166.94] Don't have Facebook.
[5167.18 → 5168.62] So back to Google Glass.
[5168.88 → 5169.58] I personally.
[5169.96 → 5171.00] Based on the battery life.
[5171.06 → 5172.58] I think they were saying something like
[5172.58 → 5173.06] what was it?
[5173.12 → 5173.70] 30 minutes.
[5174.26 → 5175.46] When you're recording video.
[5175.54 → 5176.74] Or something ludicrous like that.
[5176.82 → 5178.34] I don't remember the exact number.
[5178.46 → 5179.84] But the battery life's not there.
[5180.70 → 5184.10] I'm personally not even remotely excited about it yet.
[5184.80 → 5188.42] But Gen 3 or Gen 5 or Gen 10 of this technology
[5188.42 → 5191.30] is going to be just incredible.
[5191.84 → 5194.20] And I'll jump on the bandwagon when instead of $1,500
[5194.20 → 5196.86] I can buy it for $150, and I don't have to be
[5196.86 → 5198.22] some special dude with an invitation.
[5198.60 → 5201.20] And the functionality will be dramatically better by then.
[5201.98 → 5204.92] I also had one news item was that Google's saying
[5204.92 → 5208.16] people are apparently acquiring the Google Glass
[5208.16 → 5209.66] and they want to do whatever they want.
[5209.66 → 5210.50] But they're saying no, no, no.
[5210.52 → 5211.32] We meant to do that.
[5211.74 → 5212.44] Which like.
[5212.56 → 5213.76] I don't know how credible that is.
[5214.12 → 5217.14] Yes, but from some people I could see them being like
[5217.14 → 5217.88] oh, no, no.
[5217.94 → 5218.56] We meant to do that.
[5218.64 → 5219.44] From Google though?
[5219.64 → 5221.30] Google usually leaves things unlocked.
[5221.98 → 5222.22] Okay.
[5222.78 → 5223.12] True enough.
[5223.14 → 5224.02] That's my view of that.
[5224.10 → 5225.04] They often do.
[5225.82 → 5227.80] Now people are also talking about how apparently
[5227.80 → 5229.40] there might be like remote shut off
[5229.40 → 5232.30] and a bunch of other weird stuff.
[5232.40 → 5233.58] I don't know how true this is.
[5233.68 → 5236.02] So don't take this directly.
[5236.36 → 5239.16] But apparently Google has like quite a bit of control over it still.
[5239.66 → 5241.76] So removing that might be interesting.
[5241.90 → 5243.56] If that's even real, I don't know.
[5243.76 → 5246.24] I read that on the comments of a thread.
[5246.44 → 5249.36] This is an article from Source Fed, which is.
[5250.08 → 5251.46] Oh, oh, hold on.
[5251.68 → 5252.86] I opened it on the wrong thing.
[5253.14 → 5253.64] I know, I know.
[5253.72 → 5255.66] We're going to go a little bit over time today.
[5255.66 → 5255.70] Okay.
[5256.80 → 5261.06] So we'll do this, and then we'll be doing our Rigs of the Week.
[5261.26 → 5261.54] Oh, yeah.
[5261.58 → 5262.10] This was cool.
[5262.30 → 5263.18] So this was interesting.
[5263.30 → 5265.78] Speaking of Google and sort of all that stuff,
[5266.16 → 5267.24] this was on Source Fed.
[5267.32 → 5271.10] It's who has your back with respect to your privacy.
[5271.90 → 5275.32] So let's scroll down to basically just the chart.
[5275.52 → 5275.64] Yep.
[5275.96 → 5276.70] Who has your back?
[5277.34 → 5282.10] So the requirements are requires a warrant for content to share,
[5282.52 → 5284.48] tells users about government data requests,
[5284.94 → 5286.48] publishes transparency reports,
[5287.32 → 5289.02] publishes law enforcement guidelines,
[5289.24 → 5290.90] fights for users' privacy in courts,
[5290.90 → 5293.16] and fights for users' privacy in Congress.
[5293.72 → 5294.20] So there you go.
[5294.30 → 5296.14] Amazon only got two stars out of six.
[5296.26 → 5296.90] And you guys, okay,
[5296.90 → 5299.72] I'm not saying that this chart is the be-all and end-all
[5299.72 → 5301.22] by any stretch of the imagination.
[5301.52 → 5304.48] This is Source Fed's chart and there you go.
[5304.72 → 5306.08] But as a general guideline,
[5306.34 → 5307.50] it's kind of cool to look at
[5307.50 → 5309.64] and it makes you really think about the topic,
[5309.78 → 5310.46] if nothing else.
[5310.88 → 5313.40] Apple fights for users' privacy rights in Congress.
[5313.66 → 5314.32] That's it.
[5314.76 → 5316.78] AT&T, very low rating.
[5317.04 → 5318.60] Comcast, very low rating.
[5319.02 → 5320.36] Dropbox, look at that.
[5320.50 → 5320.92] Huge.
[5321.08 → 5324.06] So other than fighting for users' privacy rights in courts,
[5324.30 → 5325.64] they're requiring warrants,
[5325.64 → 5327.06] they're doing all the things by the book.
[5327.16 → 5328.98] Facebook only got three stars.
[5329.72 → 5331.38] So no transparency reports.
[5331.52 → 5333.68] They don't tell you about a government data request.
[5334.40 → 5336.02] Foursquare is a touch better than that.
[5336.42 → 5338.08] Google scores very well.
[5338.58 → 5340.30] So this is where I was going with that.
[5340.64 → 5342.06] LinkedIn, very well.
[5342.14 → 5344.14] The only thing they don't do is fight for it in court,
[5344.24 → 5345.24] much like Dropbox.
[5345.62 → 5347.42] Microsoft, not bad.
[5347.54 → 5348.80] Somewhere in the middle ground here.
[5349.04 → 5351.48] So the things that they don't do is fight in court
[5351.48 → 5353.88] and tell users about government data requests.
[5354.30 → 5354.70] MySpace.
[5354.70 → 5358.50] It's like, if you needed a reason to not be on MySpace anymore,
[5358.96 → 5359.44] there you go.
[5359.52 → 5360.48] So there's the rest of them.
[5360.82 → 5362.94] Twitter is across the board.
[5363.32 → 5365.08] Sonic.net, across the board.
[5367.04 → 5368.98] Verizon, yeah, not looking too good.
[5369.06 → 5370.32] Yahoo, not looking too good.
[5370.54 → 5372.52] So I just thought this was a really cool article.
[5372.68 → 5374.06] I wanted to make sure you guys see it.
[5374.12 → 5375.60] Head over to Source Fed, check it out.
[5376.14 → 5377.90] And let's do Rigs of the Week, shall we?
[5378.02 → 5378.34] All right.
[5378.58 → 5379.38] Okay, first one.
[5379.38 → 5382.74] Again, not super well versed because these are kind of huge.
[5383.08 → 5384.24] But jump into the first one real quick.
[5384.24 → 5385.62] Now this one has...
[5385.62 → 5389.02] So this is from PZT, who's a junior member on the forum.
[5389.68 → 5392.62] This guy has 10 billion pictures.
[5393.04 → 5393.24] Okay.
[5393.36 → 5395.12] So we're probably going to have to rip through a little bit.
[5395.26 → 5398.12] But as we kind of fly through here, you can just see...
[5398.12 → 5399.58] Lots of cool stuff.
[5399.70 → 5401.94] The magnitude of awesome stuff that he has, which is...
[5401.94 → 5402.48] What are those?
[5402.66 → 5403.72] Monsoon compressions.
[5404.36 → 5405.20] Very nice.
[5405.30 → 5405.50] Yeah.
[5405.68 → 5406.08] Beautiful.
[5406.44 → 5407.20] Yeah, they're awesome.
[5407.92 → 5409.22] On an Apple GHD white.
[5409.34 → 5409.90] Very nice.
[5410.40 → 5410.84] Very nice.
[5410.84 → 5413.58] Swift Tech dual DDC block, or pump top.
[5413.84 → 5414.00] Yeah.
[5415.64 → 5416.58] NZXT switch again?
[5417.40 → 5418.04] Yeah, I think so.
[5419.72 → 5421.00] I just saw the bottom of it there.
[5421.08 → 5421.24] Yeah.
[5422.90 → 5423.38] Gelid wings.
[5423.38 → 5423.74] Gelid wings.
[5423.76 → 5424.38] Nice choice.
[5426.36 → 5427.44] Coolants, quick connects.
[5427.44 → 5429.28] You'll see what those are for soon.
[5430.20 → 5432.14] Okay, we're going to have to just blow through this.
[5432.22 → 5433.80] There is actually a ton of pictures.
[5434.02 → 5435.24] Like, fly through it quite a bit.
[5436.00 → 5436.60] DA-da-da-da-da.
[5436.80 → 5438.30] And then when you start seeing certain things...
[5438.30 → 5438.90] Geo-byte board.
[5438.98 → 5439.38] Here we go.
[5439.66 → 5440.74] He's just starting.
[5440.82 → 5441.50] There's a test fit.
[5442.72 → 5443.68] Ah, very nice.
[5443.76 → 5447.00] He's putting quick connects on all the components so that he can easily upgrade things.
[5448.92 → 5449.68] Very nice.
[5449.80 → 5450.34] Very nice.
[5450.76 → 5452.60] Makes maintenance a lot less work.
[5453.76 → 5454.60] Wait for it.
[5455.38 → 5456.84] It gets super awesome all of a sudden.
[5456.92 → 5457.36] There we go.
[5457.44 → 5457.72] Okay.
[5457.80 → 5459.50] So, it changes quite a bit from there.
[5459.60 → 5460.18] So, just keep going.
[5461.86 → 5463.24] Crazy family at the front.
[5463.52 → 5463.80] Okay.
[5463.90 → 5464.12] Okay.
[5464.18 → 5464.38] Yeah.
[5464.38 → 5466.76] It changes like we're not even that far through it.
[5468.00 → 5469.02] Dominator Platinum's.
[5469.04 → 5469.42] Oh, here.
[5469.52 → 5469.64] Here.
[5469.74 → 5470.36] Go up a little bit.
[5471.06 → 5471.46] Whoa.
[5471.54 → 5472.06] Here we go.
[5472.12 → 5472.34] Yeah.
[5472.34 → 5474.62] What's going on now?
[5474.62 → 5475.38] There you go.
[5475.68 → 5477.10] So, he's making his own basement.
[5477.56 → 5477.92] Okay.
[5478.14 → 5479.52] And running quick connects through there.
[5479.76 → 5480.70] So, go down a little bit more.
[5481.10 → 5482.94] So, it shows him making his basement.
[5483.12 → 5483.34] Yep.
[5483.94 → 5484.98] So, that's awesome.
[5485.08 → 5486.44] He does a very, very good job.
[5487.20 → 5487.82] Very clean.
[5487.96 → 5488.14] Yep.
[5488.14 → 5489.30] And it looks fantastic.
[5489.70 → 5489.84] Ooh.
[5490.10 → 5491.56] Like, it looks so good.
[5491.76 → 5492.18] Very clean.
[5492.18 → 5494.00] And he takes that theme, and he carries it forward.
[5494.44 → 5495.24] Look at that keyboard.
[5495.74 → 5496.26] Yeah, it's great.
[5496.26 → 5497.02] What keycaps are those?
[5497.16 → 5499.24] That's actually just light.
[5499.36 → 5500.02] Oh, that's light.
[5500.08 → 5500.28] Okay.
[5500.36 → 5500.56] Okay.
[5501.20 → 5501.38] Yeah.
[5501.46 → 5502.50] Nice blank keyboard, though.
[5502.64 → 5503.28] Very beautiful.
[5503.80 → 5504.00] Yeah.
[5505.10 → 5505.46] Ooh.
[5505.86 → 5506.72] Tons of sleeving.
[5507.32 → 5507.68] Skyey.
[5508.50 → 5509.12] Just awesome.
[5509.22 → 5510.44] Going with the white and green theme.
[5510.88 → 5511.78] Pathogen, the name.
[5511.92 → 5512.66] Going with white and green.
[5512.94 → 5513.22] Right.
[5513.34 → 5515.12] So, pretty freaking sweet.
[5515.18 → 5515.82] Ikea desk.
[5516.32 → 5516.50] Yeah.
[5517.82 → 5518.34] Ooh.
[5518.42 → 5518.92] There we go.
[5518.92 → 5519.68] Just look at that.
[5520.56 → 5521.42] Absolutely beautiful.
[5521.42 → 5523.88] Look at the backplate on the video card.
[5524.10 → 5526.06] I was waiting to see when you were going to notice that.
[5526.06 → 5527.08] Nice touch.
[5527.38 → 5529.92] Like, just beautiful build.
[5529.92 → 5531.44] Gorgeous gaming rig.
[5532.28 → 5533.84] White LEDs down there.
[5534.56 → 5536.66] And he picked, like, the perfect fans for it.
[5536.78 → 5537.00] Yep.
[5537.16 → 5539.28] The gelid wings look fantastic in there.
[5539.42 → 5540.26] Great motherboard for it.
[5540.28 → 5541.22] It even has the skull.
[5542.88 → 5543.28] Wow.
[5543.28 → 5544.20] Because it's called Pathogen.
[5544.76 → 5547.00] Like, it's just amazing build.
[5547.14 → 5547.90] Great coolant.
[5548.40 → 5549.64] Sorry about my voice, guys.
[5550.72 → 5551.24] All right.
[5551.72 → 5552.24] So, yeah.
[5552.36 → 5554.06] Just awesome.
[5554.44 → 5555.42] Very, very, very cool.
[5555.42 → 5555.84] All right.
[5555.94 → 5557.20] So, we got our second one here.
[5557.30 → 5559.28] Before we wrap up and move to the after party,
[5559.28 → 5563.80] which is going to be Super Mario livestream, if possible.
[5564.36 → 5564.60] Okay.
[5564.66 → 5565.22] We can get it working.
[5566.14 → 5567.46] So, jump down on this one, too.
[5567.66 → 5569.38] I think you might have to be logged in to see these pictures.
[5569.48 → 5569.60] Yeah.
[5569.66 → 5571.20] If you log in, it will show them actively,
[5571.30 → 5572.38] or you can click on it individually.
[5572.50 → 5572.94] All right.
[5573.02 → 5575.80] So, let's log in as myself.
[5578.50 → 5581.08] Thanks to everyone who tuned in to the livestream this week,
[5581.14 → 5581.88] by the way, guys.
[5581.94 → 5582.56] If we don't get it.
[5582.56 → 5582.92] Lin's tech.
[5583.24 → 5583.80] Lin's tech.
[5583.80 → 5585.46] I hate this keyboard.
[5586.72 → 5588.80] It's very handy, but it's also, like...
[5590.66 → 5594.82] Hold on.
[5595.30 → 5597.52] I don't remember how far I was into my password.
[5598.20 → 5599.00] Guess we'll find out.
[5599.38 → 5599.78] Nope.
[5600.10 → 5600.82] That wasn't it.
[5601.02 → 5602.58] Just in case you guys don't know,
[5602.64 → 5603.46] he's trying to log in.
[5603.56 → 5605.10] That's why we're not showing the screen right now.
[5606.10 → 5606.80] Are we not?
[5607.08 → 5607.28] Oh.
[5608.78 → 5610.08] Oh, are you typing numbers?
[5611.14 → 5611.98] Yeah, it's okay, though.
[5611.98 → 5612.64] It doesn't do that anymore.
[5612.92 → 5613.42] There we go.
[5613.48 → 5615.10] Okay, I think my mod...
[5615.98 → 5617.60] They didn't see the first log.
[5618.14 → 5618.56] Of what?
[5619.56 → 5619.84] What?
[5620.32 → 5621.30] They didn't see the first build log.
[5621.30 → 5621.94] That wasn't over there?
[5623.16 → 5623.52] Really?
[5623.84 → 5624.22] At all?
[5624.30 → 5625.10] Oh, no.
[5626.00 → 5626.72] Oh, oops.
[5626.86 → 5627.18] No.
[5627.84 → 5628.38] My bad.
[5628.74 → 5629.08] No.
[5629.62 → 5631.48] Okay, well, let's go really quickly, then.
[5631.98 → 5633.32] We have to show his build.
[5633.54 → 5634.82] Oh, that's so depressing.
[5634.82 → 5635.16] So, sorry.
[5635.46 → 5635.86] PUT.
[5636.66 → 5638.08] I can't believe we did that.
[5638.32 → 5638.60] Meow.
[5639.88 → 5641.90] I wonder how many tweets we have about that.
[5642.04 → 5642.28] Anyway.
[5642.92 → 5643.56] A few at least.
[5643.62 → 5644.18] Oh, come on.
[5644.50 → 5646.08] It's not staying on there for me.
[5646.50 → 5647.94] Okay, so here's where we get...
[5647.94 → 5649.82] Where do we get outside where he's cutting the midplate?
[5649.94 → 5650.92] Okay, we missed that part.
[5651.00 → 5651.62] Don't worry about it.
[5652.86 → 5653.38] Did we?
[5653.82 → 5654.08] Yeah.
[5654.30 → 5656.42] Anyway, you can go check it out on the forum, guys.
[5656.50 → 5658.40] That's always an option if we screw things up.
[5658.58 → 5659.90] I'll tweet out a link for it.
[5660.88 → 5662.62] Yeah, Dominator Platinums.
[5662.88 → 5663.40] There we go.
[5663.40 → 5664.10] Yeah, there we go.
[5664.10 → 5665.02] There's the midplate.
[5665.54 → 5666.30] Cutting holes.
[5667.38 → 5667.66] Okay.
[5668.24 → 5669.26] Let's keep on going.
[5669.36 → 5669.86] Very clean.
[5670.10 → 5671.16] Beautiful peripherals.
[5671.50 → 5674.56] That explains why, like, a hundred people tuned out of the livestream while we were doing
[5674.56 → 5675.76] this, because I thought it was a cool build.
[5677.72 → 5678.16] Sleeving.
[5678.16 → 5679.16] Great looking.
[5679.16 → 5680.16] Great looking.
[5680.16 → 5680.84] Great looking.
[5680.84 → 5682.62] Great looking Ikea desk there.
[5683.08 → 5684.02] Nice themed build.
[5684.22 → 5684.80] There we go.
[5685.30 → 5685.78] Beautiful.
[5686.78 → 5687.74] Absolutely gorgeous.
[5687.96 → 5688.84] The backplate's amazing.
[5689.14 → 5690.16] Backplate on the video card.
[5690.26 → 5691.14] Mentioned this before.
[5691.14 → 5695.04] I apologize for the part where I mentioned it, and you couldn't actually look at it.
[5695.54 → 5701.60] Just, oh, just sexy sleeving, matching motherboard, matching the Gelid wing fans look fantastic in
[5701.60 → 5701.84] there.
[5702.54 → 5705.78] All these little shots of the inside just look outstanding.
[5705.78 → 5707.60] I mean, look at the shininess of this.
[5707.64 → 5708.62] That's so awesome.
[5708.82 → 5713.76] White LEDs using the built-in lighting, the Switch 810, which is a really nice thing to
[5713.76 → 5714.06] have.
[5714.92 → 5716.46] And there we go.
[5716.62 → 5719.88] Now on to the second build log.
[5720.12 → 5720.82] There we are.
[5720.82 → 5722.90] All right.
[5723.40 → 5724.24] So start scrolling down.
[5724.30 → 5726.64] I'm going to tweet out that link for the build log.
[5727.42 → 5728.20] Another Switch?
[5729.00 → 5729.22] Yeah.
[5729.34 → 5729.86] There you go.
[5729.98 → 5731.06] But very different build.
[5731.12 → 5731.34] Ooh.
[5731.60 → 5732.86] Like very different build.
[5732.88 → 5733.68] Why, hello there.
[5734.46 → 5736.58] T-Virus in the back, which is just absolutely awesome.
[5736.64 → 5737.52] T-Virus is amazing.
[5737.64 → 5738.72] Everyone should have a T-Virus.
[5739.28 → 5740.80] And like, the position's very cool.
[5741.02 → 5745.66] And when you see his desk set up, it even makes a lot more sense as to why he put it where
[5745.66 → 5745.96] it is.
[5746.02 → 5747.46] So this build is very attainable.
[5747.46 → 5750.66] I mean, this is something where no custom fabrication's been done.
[5751.14 → 5753.30] You know, MCP-655 pump.
[5753.46 → 5755.10] You know, nice water cooling and all that.
[5755.18 → 5755.86] But this is doable.
[5757.04 → 5757.24] Yeah.
[5757.34 → 5757.84] Nice pictures.
[5758.44 → 5758.70] Yeah.
[5758.84 → 5759.56] They got better here.
[5760.26 → 5760.66] Yeah.
[5760.82 → 5762.00] They get better pretty quick.
[5762.02 → 5763.80] Kingston Hyper memory looks good.
[5763.84 → 5764.46] Looking good.
[5765.20 → 5767.60] Sabertoothed boards make for such a clean looking build.
[5767.62 → 5769.24] They just look so awesome.
[5769.40 → 5769.58] Yeah.
[5771.36 → 5773.06] I've seen the upcoming Sabertoothed.
[5773.30 → 5773.56] Yeah?
[5773.90 → 5774.12] Yeah.
[5774.18 → 5775.16] Can't say anything about it, though.
[5775.16 → 5775.34] Ugh.
[5777.14 → 5777.64] All right.
[5777.72 → 5778.64] Some more night shots.
[5778.74 → 5779.48] Looking good.
[5780.82 → 5781.14] Okay.
[5781.54 → 5783.34] I'm letting you do commentary on these, so.
[5783.52 → 5783.90] I'm sorry.
[5783.96 → 5784.92] I was tweeting out that thing.
[5785.62 → 5785.78] Yeah.
[5785.86 → 5786.72] Here you can see his desk.
[5786.90 → 5787.14] There.
[5787.36 → 5788.10] You're at his desk.
[5788.18 → 5789.22] You can see the T-Virus.
[5789.82 → 5790.14] Yeah.
[5790.14 → 5793.92] Instead of it being covered up by the side panel, because the window is honestly not that
[5793.92 → 5794.24] big.
[5794.36 → 5794.60] No.
[5794.72 → 5796.22] It's all small on the Switch 810.
[5796.24 → 5796.44] Yeah.
[5796.44 → 5801.20] So, by putting it in the back, he can actually see his T-Virus all the time.
[5801.30 → 5801.58] Enjoy it.
[5801.58 → 5804.84] So, that's very cool, because most people will go, oh, just to the right of the motherboard.
[5804.98 → 5805.22] Bam.
[5805.28 → 5805.86] There's my reservoir.
[5805.94 → 5806.60] That's where mine is.
[5806.80 → 5808.16] That's where mine is.
[5808.48 → 5809.42] But I can see mine.
[5810.14 → 5810.42] Yeah.
[5810.46 → 5811.24] And I can see mine, too.
[5811.28 → 5811.74] I have a big window.
[5811.74 → 5815.62] But just because of how he has his desk set up with his computer kind of hanging off the
[5815.62 → 5820.40] edge, which is kind of sketchy, but where he's sitting, he can actually see his T-Virus,
[5820.56 → 5822.56] which is very cool and very understandable.
[5823.08 → 5826.02] So, that's an awesome, obtainable level build.
[5826.18 → 5827.28] The one before that was...
[5827.28 → 5828.34] More like the ridiculous build.
[5828.34 → 5829.92] The ridiculously awesome level.
[5830.50 → 5831.70] Not quite as obtainable.
[5831.90 → 5832.68] Okay, guys.
[5832.98 → 5836.98] Thank you for tuning in to the Linus Tech Tips livestream, which we're going to rename
[5836.98 → 5840.22] at some point to something else.
[5840.44 → 5841.42] To something that makes sense.
[5841.42 → 5842.72] Yeah, something that, like...
[5842.72 → 5844.52] Maybe we should ask for suggestions on the forum.
[5844.56 → 5847.98] We can ask for suggestions, but odds are we probably won't take any of them, because,
[5848.70 → 5851.48] you know, it's just a matter of, you know, you want to come up with a brand identity
[5851.48 → 5852.30] that's really you.
[5852.42 → 5852.60] That's true.
[5852.90 → 5857.56] But, I mean, you guys are welcome to send suggestions via Twitter or whatever else.
[5857.56 → 5859.32] I'll probably see them, if nothing else.
[5859.60 → 5859.80] Yeah.
[5860.14 → 5863.78] So, apparently I'm officially fired by the viewers.
[5865.04 → 5865.80] All right, then.
[5866.82 → 5868.28] We both got fired today.
[5869.14 → 5869.88] Yeah, okay.
[5869.88 → 5870.28] Yeah.
[5870.28 → 5872.26] Yeah, we both got hardcore fired.
[5872.70 → 5873.38] All right, guys.
[5873.58 → 5874.86] So, don't forget.
[5875.16 → 5876.56] Join the Linus Tech Tips Forum.
[5876.98 → 5878.14] It's kind of awesome.
[5878.28 → 5880.06] We're actually going to be doing something soon.
[5880.24 → 5884.92] We're going to release a video on the YouTube channel where we challenge you to make the Linus
[5884.92 → 5886.36] Tech Tips Forum your homepage.
[5886.90 → 5893.78] Whether it's the news section, or whether it's just the home screen, or the latest topic section,
[5893.78 → 5898.94] we are going to be working hard to make this an absolutely awesome community.
[5898.94 → 5902.70] We have some plans to make the transition to home screen seamless.
[5902.94 → 5903.14] Yep.
[5903.24 → 5904.04] So, we're working on that.
[5904.04 → 5904.22] Yep.
[5904.30 → 5905.20] So, we're working on that.
[5905.38 → 5909.54] I mean, honestly, if you have anything you want to talk about tech-wise, it's one of the
[5909.54 → 5911.96] most active forums I have ever seen.
[5912.68 → 5913.82] Everyone gets a reply.
[5913.82 → 5918.30] And a comment we consistently get, and something we try to consistently uphold, is that people
[5918.30 → 5918.74] are friendly.
[5919.14 → 5919.26] Yeah.
[5919.58 → 5923.16] So, even if you're worried that it might be a stupid question, just ask.
[5923.38 → 5924.28] You'll probably get a good answer.
[5924.34 → 5925.48] I had someone PM me.
[5925.94 → 5927.08] This was a stupid question.
[5927.16 → 5929.46] I didn't want to ask it, so I sent it to you in PM.
[5930.18 → 5931.44] And then he asked it, and it was fine.
[5931.72 → 5931.94] Yeah.
[5932.24 → 5932.44] Yep.
[5932.66 → 5933.68] So, don't worry about it.
[5933.70 → 5936.44] No one will pile on you, and if they do, report it.
[5936.52 → 5937.58] We'll get it taken care of.
[5937.62 → 5939.30] The moderation team is absolutely amazing.
[5939.38 → 5939.90] Good night, everyone.
[5940.44 → 5941.34] And we'll be back.
[5941.40 → 5944.14] You know, it'll probably take us a little while to get this set up, but we'll be back
[5944.14 → 5945.18] with some Super Mario World.
[5945.34 → 5945.96] Thanks for watching.
[5945.96 → 5946.04] Bye.
