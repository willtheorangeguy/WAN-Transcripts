[0.00 → 8.64] Alright, so we are theoretically live. I have no idea what the stream quality is
[8.64 → 14.12] going to be like. We try to restart and yes we know we definitely need to move
[14.12 → 21.64] on from XSplit because this is just clearly not gonna work for us. How is the
[21.64 → 28.08] audio sync? How's the audio quality guys? Let me know. Let me know.
[30.00 → 39.00] Are we good? Are we okay? People are saying loading, and they are not necessarily
[39.00 → 44.32] telling me whether the audio is fixed again or not. And apparently it's just
[44.32 → 53.52] loading. A few people are in. People are saying it's all good, and hopefully it's
[53.52 → 58.98] all fixed. So all we did was restart. We changed absolutely nothing else. Welcome
[58.98 → 64.50] to the live stream here tonight guys, and hopefully we are all good for the rest
[64.50 → 68.22] of the night. So why don't we start out with some Twitter Q&A since that's
[68.22 → 73.98] apparently what we do on this show. Yay. There we go. Twitter, five new interactions.
[73.98 → 80.98] Is the stream live yet? Asks Fulfil Abbas. To which I would reply, yes it is
[80.98 → 86.50] finally live. RankUpGamers at RankUpGamers on Twitter asks can you please
[86.50 → 90.40] promote the Linus Tech Tips Folding at Home team? So for those of you guys who
[90.40 → 94.12] don't know what folding at home is, basically it's a distributed computing
[94.12 → 98.74] thing that was originally, what was it, Stanford University set this up as a way
[98.74 → 105.34] to calculate the folding of proteins which is useful for studying and even
[105.34 → 112.06] potentially curing, curing, curing, curing, curing, a wide variety of different
[112.06 → 116.62] different diseases. It could help with things like Alzheimer's or even cancer
[116.62 → 122.02] and all kinds of like really, really bad things like that. So folding at home teams
[122.02 → 125.62] are more just like people kind of getting together and having friendly
[125.62 → 129.88] competition over who can distribute the most computing to their computers and
[129.88 → 133.96] then contribute those results back to Stanford where they can be examined and
[133.96 → 137.56] basically it's more powerful than even the most powerful supercomputer and...
[137.56 → 141.48] Because there's so many of them. Yeah, because there are so many nodes. And we have
[141.48 → 146.44] we have a pretty awesome folding team we have a pretty awesome Brink team
[146.44 → 150.20] as well. So if you're into that kind of stuff either of them are great. Folding is
[150.20 → 153.72] very specifically like protein folding and stuff. Brink you can do a bunch
[153.72 → 157.58] of different stuff. We've got both the teams. Both are quite organized and they
[157.58 → 161.84] both have their own section on the forum. So yeah, check it out. Yeah, so yeah LinusTechTips.com
[161.84 → 165.84] and then once you're there actually here...
[165.84 → 169.84] I'm just kind of hating its life too much right now. So why don't we go to my first topic of the night.
[169.84 → 170.84] Asus.
[170.84 → 175.84] Asus actually just released teasers for their upcoming Z87
[175.84 → 180.84] motherboards for a couple of them. I don't know if you guys have seen this already, but I'm going to go ahead and look at the
[180.84 → 185.40] and switch to it, and hopefully I'll be bringing it up on the first episode here.
[187.52 → 209.42] Asus actually just released teasers for their upcoming Z87 motherboards for a couple of them. I don't know if you guys have seen this already, but I'm going to go ahead and load this up here and switch to it, and hopefully I'll
[209.42 → 209.66] be back.
[210.84 → 224.34] There we go and there we go we have audio now. I had to reset things up because I restarted and had to restart Split and all that good stuff.
[224.34 → 240.82] So DOG an Asus Z87 motherboard teaser. So right here this guy is the Grafton Z87 and probably the most noteworthy thing about this motherboard other than the fact that it's going to have an 1150 socket, be compatible with Intel Haswell CPU,
[240.84 → 254.16] and it's a Z87. These are all notable things. It's revision 1.01. It's revision 1.01. This we can see. I'm not quite sure why that's the exact like centre of their glamour shot.
[254.16 → 270.82] But I guess the point is that this right here is a Ultimate Force logo which is a pretty cool thing because that basically means that we are getting another revision that is not a Sabre 2.
[270.82 → 285.52] but it's actually a completely different line now of tough series motherboards. So I have no idea what differentiates a Grafton from a Sabre 2 other than the fact that one of them is completely mythological
[285.52 → 295.18] and one of them has been extinct for thousands upon thousands of years. Those are different things about them. Here, tell me what you think Asus might be doing with a Grafton board.
[295.18 → 307.18] Probably very similar but different colour scheme. And Sabre tooth is all about like the shield and stuff. So maybe they'll come up with something new and interesting for Grafton that is not the big armour shield thing.
[307.18 → 313.18] So not the mind you there have been Sabre tooth boards that don't have thermal armour like the 990FX board.
[313.18 → 319.18] Wasn't there just kind of at the same time of two of them? So the 68 and 990FX?
[319.18 → 325.18] Yeah. And then they went back to armour. And then they went back to armour with the Z77. So I think they're gonna kind of continue the armour thing.
[325.18 → 331.18] Because they went armour and then were like noon and then were like yes we're going to keep the armour because people didn't like it when it went away.
[331.18 → 337.18] Even though it's just a plastic shield. But if they don't, people don't like it they just take it off. The funny thing about it is that people didn't like it when it showed up.
[337.18 → 347.18] But I think people liked it less when it went away. When it went away. So there's more anger and hatred when it's away. Might as well bring it back.
[347.18 → 353.18] So there's a vocal minority that's mad that it exists. And honestly the people who are mad that it exists kind of have a point.
[353.18 → 360.18] Yes, but you can just take it off. I know you can take it off, but it costs money. And you could also, like it costs money for ASUS.
[360.18 → 365.18] They could have made my board a couple dollars cheaper and just not bothered with a piece of plastic. Because I mean.
[365.18 → 372.18] It looks kind of cool though. Yeah, it looks. Okay yes. It looks cool. And as someone who does care about the aesthetics of a motherboard.
[372.18 → 377.18] I think most of the people here, speaking to you guys, care about the aesthetics of their computer.
[377.18 → 385.18] I would love for you guys to weigh in on that on Twitter while I finish telling him what I think about the...
[385.18 → 395.18] Here's my problem with the thermal armour. So number one is that the thermal armour doesn't contribute anything in terms of interference reduction.
[395.18 → 404.18] Because it's made of plastic. Number two is that it necessitates by thermally armouring the motherboard.
[404.18 → 409.18] You're actually isolating the heat generating components from the free flowing air in your case.
[409.18 → 411.18] And that's why they put those little...
[411.18 → 417.18] Right. Which necessitates the use of whiny little 40 millimetre fans.
[417.18 → 420.18] So justify the thermal armour to me again.
[420.18 → 424.18] I'm just... I don't have one. I'm just saying it looks good.
[424.18 → 427.18] Okay. And it does look good. It does. It looks awesome.
[427.18 → 430.18] It looks outstanding. I think we can all agree on that.
[430.18 → 435.18] And for 40 millimetre fans, I've heard a lot worse.
[435.18 → 437.18] That's true. That's true.
[437.18 → 438.18] Like way worse.
[438.18 → 445.18] I had an old A-Bit NF7S. This is before your time. Socket A board. That thing just whined.
[445.18 → 447.18] Oh, for sure. Yeah.
[447.18 → 450.18] And then, and then, on like half of them, the fan failed.
[450.18 → 452.18] And then it was like...
[452.18 → 457.18] And then your chipset overheated.
[457.18 → 458.18] Which is bad.
[458.18 → 460.18] Which is a bad thing.
[460.18 → 461.18] All right. Well, let's go ahead.
[461.18 → 463.18] Yeah. So like, four or four even a millimetre fan is not bad.
[463.18 → 465.18] Let's go ahead and switch back here.
[465.18 → 472.18] So they're also teasing a, ahem, new true DOG innovation of some sort.
[472.18 → 475.18] And I don't think anyone knows what the heck this thing is.
[475.18 → 477.18] Reminds me of OC key.
[477.18 → 479.18] Looks kind of like an OC key, but see...
[479.18 → 481.18] Okay. So there's some kind of custom interface here.
[481.18 → 483.18] We have no idea what that is.
[483.18 → 485.18] And then there's some kind of arrow here.
[485.18 → 486.18] So it almost...
[486.18 → 488.18] Probably plugging it in.
[488.18 → 499.18] But the funny thing about that is that this arrow points in a direction that would seem to facilitate this pinout being plugged into...
[499.18 → 500.18] Into what though?
[500.18 → 501.18] I don't know.
[501.18 → 502.18] Probably a proprietary plug.
[502.18 → 504.18] Well, we're speculating here, man.
[504.18 → 505.18] Come on.
[505.18 → 506.18] Come up with something.
[506.18 → 507.18] Probably a proprietary plug.
[507.18 → 514.18] You know what it probably does is it probably makes your video card outputs higher resolution.
[514.18 → 515.18] Yes.
[515.18 → 516.18] Actually, no.
[516.18 → 520.18] Where would that plug into on a video card?
[520.18 → 524.18] Maybe they have an DOG video card coming that it plugs into.
[524.18 → 526.18] That's definitely what it is.
[526.18 → 527.18] That's definitely not what it is.
[527.18 → 528.18] No debate.
[528.18 → 529.18] That's exactly what it is.
[529.18 → 532.18] Guys, sort of, you know, the disclaimer here.
[532.18 → 535.18] We actually don't know what these things are.
[535.18 → 536.18] I have no idea.
[536.18 → 537.18] We have no idea.
[537.18 → 539.18] We are actually just guessing.
[539.18 → 545.18] And you should take everything we say with a grain of salt the size of like a human fist.
[545.18 → 546.18] Iceland.
[546.18 → 547.18] Yeah.
[547.18 → 548.18] Yeah.
[548.18 → 550.18] The size of a small island.
[550.18 → 552.18] Iceland is small.
[552.18 → 553.18] Okay.
[553.18 → 555.18] How do you define big?
[555.18 → 556.18] Australia is a big island.
[556.18 → 557.18] Australia is a continent.
[557.18 → 558.18] It's also an island.
[558.18 → 560.18] It's also a continent.
[560.18 → 561.18] But it's also an island.
[561.18 → 562.18] Which is like the biggest form of islands.
[562.18 → 563.18] We're kind of an island.
[563.18 → 564.18] Not really.
[564.18 → 565.18] Kind of.
[565.18 → 569.18] North America and South America are both continents and neither of which are islands.
[569.18 → 571.18] So is your definition of an island is to...
[571.18 → 574.18] Your definition of not being an island is having at least two continents together?
[574.18 → 575.18] No.
[575.18 → 578.18] The definition of island is surrounded by water on all sides.
[578.18 → 579.18] We're surrounded by water.
[579.18 → 582.18] North America is not surrounded by all sides.
[582.18 → 584.18] So if you have two countries...
[584.18 → 586.18] So say Canada was split in half, and we're two countries.
[586.18 → 591.18] So the second we get Quebec, if Quebec splits off, we are no longer a...
[591.18 → 593.18] Like, does that matter?
[593.18 → 594.18] Well, we wouldn't be an island by the way.
[594.18 → 597.18] Say the states wasn't there, and we were a thing.
[597.18 → 598.18] Yeah.
[598.18 → 601.18] And Quebec split off, would we no longer be an island?
[601.18 → 603.18] We would be an island.
[603.18 → 605.18] But we have Quebec touching us.
[605.18 → 606.18] Right.
[606.18 → 607.18] Meaning there's no water on all sides.
[607.18 → 608.18] But we'd be on an island.
[608.18 → 611.18] And the island would be called North America.
[611.18 → 615.18] The problem is that North America is not in and itself an island.
[615.18 → 616.18] So you're saying two continents.
[616.18 → 618.18] Because it's connected to a land map.
[618.18 → 619.18] You're saying two continents.
[619.18 → 622.18] North and South America combined, you could make the argument, are an island.
[622.18 → 623.18] That's what I'm saying.
[623.18 → 624.18] But Australia is an island.
[624.18 → 625.18] It's also a continent.
[625.18 → 629.18] At least it's not incontinent.
[629.18 → 633.18] Shout out to our Australian viewers.
[633.18 → 636.18] We're not trying to appear too ignorant about your country slash continent.
[636.18 → 637.18] Some of my mods are Australian.
[637.18 → 638.18] Slash island.
[638.18 → 639.18] Some of my mods are Australian.
[639.18 → 640.18] And they live on an island.
[640.18 → 641.18] And they're awesome.
[641.18 → 642.18] Where did...
[642.18 → 643.18] How did we get into this?
[643.18 → 644.18] I have no idea.
[644.18 → 646.18] Why are you talking about islands?
[646.18 → 647.18] I...
[647.18 → 648.18] What?
[648.18 → 650.18] I'm pretty sure you started this.
[650.18 → 653.18] And since there's no way to go back in time and find out...
[653.18 → 654.18] You mean the archive?
[654.18 → 655.18] No.
[655.18 → 657.18] No way to go back in time.
[657.18 → 659.18] Moving right along.
[659.18 → 660.18] Wait.
[660.18 → 661.18] Is it...
[661.18 → 665.18] The tastiest deluxe we have ever made.
[665.18 → 666.18] Nope.
[666.18 → 667.18] Say ASUS.
[667.18 → 670.18] So they've gone ahead and put a bunch of M&Ms on it.
[670.18 → 674.18] And there are a couple of things that I noticed about it.
[674.18 → 679.18] And then Slick actually made his own set of realizations about this particular picture.
[679.18 → 680.18] So...
[680.18 → 681.18] It probably tastes good.
[681.18 → 682.18] Yeah.
[682.18 → 683.18] The first thing I noticed was the M&Ms.
[683.18 → 684.18] And actually that was all I noticed.
[684.18 → 686.18] So Slick, why don't you share your realization with the viewers?
[686.18 → 689.18] At first I was like, oh, they released a deluxe border with a black PCB.
[689.18 → 690.18] Yeah.
[690.18 → 691.18] That was the best.
[691.18 → 692.18] Oh, they already have black PCBs.
[692.18 → 695.18] But the PCI Express slots are black, which is nice.
[695.18 → 697.18] And that is the realization that I was actually...
[697.18 → 701.18] I wasn't even expecting you to tell the story about how you thought deluxe boards didn't have black PCBs.
[701.18 → 705.18] You know how long ago it was that deluxe boards did not have black PCBs?
[705.18 → 706.18] That's why I...
[706.18 → 710.18] My A8N32 SLI Deluxe had a black PCB.
[710.18 → 711.18] Waters.
[713.18 → 714.18] There's so much blue on it.
[714.18 → 717.18] When I see the board I think of blue because there's so much blue on it.
[717.18 → 722.18] That's true, but there isn't any more blue on it than there is red on an DOG board.
[722.18 → 723.18] Do we have any DOG boards handy?
[723.18 → 725.18] Any DOG boards in the house?
[725.18 → 726.18] Where's our DOG boards?
[726.18 → 727.18] There's one.
[727.18 → 730.18] One right there and one right here.
[730.18 → 732.18] I don't know how you didn't see either of them.
[732.18 → 735.18] Well, at least I knew that they have black PCBs.
[735.18 → 736.18] Ugh, whatever man.
[736.18 → 737.18] Actually, you know what?
[737.18 → 738.18] You're probably right.
[738.18 → 742.18] Because the thing about DOG boards is they have a lot more consistency to their colour scheme.
[742.18 → 747.18] Where it's like they'll have black and then some black and red accents.
[747.18 → 749.18] And there's definitely less red on this.
[749.18 → 750.18] That's true.
[750.18 → 755.18] And the deluxe boards though, they'll have blue accents and then white accents.
[755.18 → 757.18] With light blue and light blue.
[757.18 → 758.18] And then dark blue.
[758.18 → 759.18] And then like...
[759.18 → 761.18] Like three or four different shades of blue.
[761.18 → 762.18] Okay, that is true.
[762.18 → 764.18] Or even like silver.
[764.18 → 765.18] We've got one there, actually.
[765.18 → 767.18] It's got silver, light blue, dark blue.
[767.18 → 772.18] Light colours with light blue and dark blue and like just blue everywhere.
[772.18 → 773.18] Okay, I'll give you that one.
[773.18 → 777.18] So I think I had asked the viewers for some Twitter Q&A at some point here.
[777.18 → 781.18] But I think I've gone and screwed up my windows here.
[781.18 → 784.18] Okay, so we're going to try this one more time, and we're going to hope this...
[784.18 → 785.18] Did you fix your desktop view?
[785.18 → 787.18] Isn't the desktop view of...
[787.18 → 788.18] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I didn't fix that.
[788.18 → 791.18] We're going to try this one more time even though...
[791.18 → 795.18] I actually don't think it's the thing that screwed up the live stream last time.
[795.18 → 799.18] But guys, please stay tuned for a word from our sponsors and all of that.
[799.18 → 801.18] We do have to show you this.
[801.18 → 803.18] And since I can't upload the stream that I did last time,
[803.18 → 805.18] I hope you guys will sit through this one more time for me.
[821.18 → 824.18] This video is brought to you by our trusted partner Intel.
[824.18 → 829.18] For a limited time only with the purchase of any unlocked Core i5 or Core i7 Intel CPU,
[829.18 → 833.18] get a free Intel beanie with a chance to win an Intel snowboard.
[833.18 → 836.18] Valid for Canadian and US customers only, some restrictions apply.
[836.18 → 839.18] For complete details, visit IntelGamingPromo.com.
[839.18 → 842.18] IntelGamingPromo.com
[842.18 → 851.18] Okay, so do you think they're still here?
[851.18 → 852.18] No.
[852.18 → 853.18] No? Do you think they all just left?
[853.18 → 854.18] Yeah.
[854.18 → 858.18] You broke the damn stream after making me watch an ad.
[858.18 → 860.18] Then you just make me watch another ad.
[860.18 → 862.18] What are you trying to do?
[862.18 → 863.18] I'm sorry you guys.
[863.18 → 865.18] There's nothing I can do about it.
[865.18 → 867.18] I have to have something on it.
[867.18 → 871.18] And people are like, so what's the point of an Intel branded snowboard?
[871.18 → 872.18] You know what?
[872.18 → 875.18] That's actually a perfect question because we've had a lot of people ask this.
[875.18 → 879.18] And, I mean, honestly guys, I'm with you.
[879.18 → 881.18] I want to fight the nerd stereotypes.
[881.18 → 888.18] But when I upload a video that has an ad on it that goes, buy an Intel CPU, get a chance
[888.18 → 894.18] to win an Intel themed snowboard with like an Intel paint job on it, and half the comments
[894.18 → 897.18] under the video are, what would I do with a snowboard?
[897.18 → 899.18] I want an Intel snowboard.
[899.18 → 900.18] That would be awesome.
[900.18 → 902.18] I mean, I don't even know.
[902.18 → 903.18] I don't even know.
[903.18 → 907.18] Like how can we, how is the how are we in a defensible position at that point?
[907.18 → 910.18] If we actually don't know what a snowboard would be for.
[910.18 → 914.18] Maybe 50% of our viewers are skiers.
[914.18 → 915.18] That could be it.
[915.18 → 919.18] Although there was, there were at least a couple of guys that posted specifically, I don't
[919.18 → 920.18] go outside.
[920.18 → 924.18] What would I do with a snowboard?
[924.18 → 927.18] To which the reply might be, well, you could give it to your friends who snowboard, but
[927.18 → 931.18] then I have a feeling I'm just going to get a like forever alone picture back.
[931.18 → 934.18] That's mean.
[934.18 → 935.18] Yeah.
[935.18 → 937.18] I mean, oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, there we go.
[937.18 → 940.18] Epic Sniper 145 is a skier.
[940.18 → 944.18] So that he might be one of the or she, she could be a girl.
[944.18 → 950.18] Might be one of the ones who, who, who, who wouldn't know who wouldn't know what to do
[950.18 → 951.18] with a snowboard.
[951.18 → 952.18] And you know what?
[952.18 → 954.18] Here's another perfect point.
[954.18 → 955.18] I mean, you know, it would be like, it would be like, it would be like, it would be like,
[955.18 → 959.18] the very best kind of cannot have like that limited edition stuff where no matter who you
[959.18 → 960.18] show it to, you get to be like, yeah, cannot have.
[960.18 → 961.18] Like X amount of people have this.
[961.18 → 962.18] Yeah.
[962.18 → 965.18] Like 15, I think they have 15 boards to give away.
[965.18 → 971.56] wall just saying I mean if you have like exclusive and then if you happen to go
[971.56 → 977.10] on a trip you would just have like this awesome yeah, and it would be like it
[977.10 → 981.08] would be like the very best kind of cannot have like that limited edition
[981.08 → 986.24] stuff where no matter who you show it to you get to be like yeah cannot have like
[986.24 → 990.42] X amount of people have this yeah like 15 I think they have 15 boards to give
[990.42 → 996.44] away so anyway guys if you're in Canada or the US if you bought a 3570 K 3770 K
[996.44 → 1002.54] 38 no 3820 is not unlocked is it is has to be unlockable, and it has to be Ivy
[1002.54 → 1007.04] Bridge no it doesn't have to be Ivy Bridge does it I think Sandy Bridge is
[1007.04 → 1011.16] okay oh whatever an unlocked Intel chip between those dates that were in the
[1011.16 → 1015.36] video I think what is it February 1st to March 31st or if anyone you know you can
[1015.36 → 1018.86] submit like their receipt if they don't care about it if anything is nothing
[1018.86 → 1023.42] else you get a free hat so there you go it's ready hat free hat beanie
[1023.42 → 1027.14] it's a beanie what's the difference between a beanie and a hat doesn't a hat
[1027.14 → 1031.86] usually have like a think the hats just something that goes on a thing that
[1031.86 → 1038.04] goes on your head all right so beanie, so technically this is a hat yeah okay
[1038.04 → 1051.42] that's a hat your hair still damp yeah oh well moving right along let's do some
[1051.42 → 1057.36] Twitter we please promote the LTT folding at home team yeah 136 new interactions
[1057.36 → 1060.06] probably half of them are complaining about the live stream not working I'm
[1060.06 → 1065.82] very sorry you guys I'm sorry we can't click we can't click we can't click image
[1065.82 → 1069.06] links in the live stream because sometimes they're bad we've had some
[1069.06 → 1071.70] problems yeah we've had problems with that I think the snowboard could be a
[1071.70 → 1075.78] weapon are you or slick excited about the legendary update for Skyrim have you
[1075.78 → 1082.02] heard about this heard like tidbits but never actually read into it, you know
[1082.02 → 1085.42] what why don't we just use that as a springboard into the thing that you were
[1085.42 → 1092.16] super excited about which is that Elder Scrolls online is going to be at
[1092.16 → 1096.84] PAX East, and it will be playable at PAX East, and they're like giving some stuff away I think they
[1096.84 → 1103.40] might be giving away like in-game cosmetic items on release maybe all this is kind of
[1103.40 → 1106.62] like fluffy, but they're definitely going to be at PAX East so what all do we know about
[1106.62 → 1113.82] Elder Scrolls online so far it's all like changing that's why I don't really like
[1113.82 → 1118.12] actually officially saying anything because when they originally announced it like doggy-paddle so
[1118.12 → 1122.40] much stuff has changed yeah they're listening to people, but then they're also not listening to
[1122.40 → 1128.36] people I'm a pretty huge Elder Scrolls fan, but I'm worried that they're going to deviate too far away
[1128.36 → 1134.68] from the Elder Scrolls norm and Elder Scrolls has a lot of hard come just can try to stay
[1134.68 → 1141.88] serious while you doggy-paddle towards me whatever the heck that I'm staying afloat see I got my bounce I got my
[1141.88 → 1152.38] Bob going on here okay moving on carry on I'm good okay so basically they're listening about some things they're not
[1152.38 → 1169.88] they're not listening about other things I'm worried about them deviating too far away from the lore deviating too far away from the Elder Scrolls universe like one thing is the game is not designed to be played in first person really it is designed to be played third person MMO style camera sort of which is here not really Elder Scrolls style
[1169.88 → 1196.88] see that to me the funny thing to me about third person is I personally find it to be less immersive from an RPG yes oh for sure I totally agree like totally less immersive I find it to be more contrived it's like I don't feel like I'm that guy sometimes I feel like I'm a weird guy following around some guy, or usually I play like female mages, so I'm like watching this chick like all the time
[1196.88 → 1203.88] at the same time okay first this was on a rumour site if it's just not this way sorry
[1203.88 → 1226.86] go ahead but like what are you even doing why are they climbing up onto a table that's not the sturdiest table I know okay oh he's going to pretend he's okay there we go one game that I actually find it's pretty okay in is Assassin's Creed and I think it's because they have to have it, and it's over the shoulder um not quite gears in the
[1226.86 → 1233.86] what that was the weirdest thing because I did not see you there, so I'm like
[1233.86 → 1252.28] what um it's its it's way closer in than most MMO cams are, but I think that works because you kind of need to be able to see all around you for fighting right I mean for a tactical game I don't mind it so for something like wow or for something honestly like Dragon Age for example Dragon Age would have been a disaster
[1252.28 → 1265.28] That would have been ridiculous if you're controlling multiple people then you know yay third person that's fine but what excuse is there if there's a single character that you're controlling to have a third person I don't understand
[1265.28 → 1267.28] Well Assassin's Creed I think it works
[1267.28 → 1268.34] Okay but
[1268.34 → 1269.28] You get surrounded a lot
[1269.28 → 1276.28] Okay, but Assassin's Creed is not an RPG I would make that argument because you are playing as a character
[1276.28 → 1277.28] It's an action game
[1277.28 → 1279.28] You're not playing his role it's an action game
[1279.28 → 1280.28] It's an action game yeah
[1280.28 → 1283.28] So Elder Scrolls has to be RPG is all about immersion
[1283.28 → 1290.28] Yeah I'm on your side man I want it first person I want like just make it Elder Scrolls and make multiple people in the game
[1290.28 → 1300.28] But here's the problem what does that do for the mass market appeal of all these MMO gamers who are used to playing with third person cam how are they going to sell this thing
[1300.28 → 1307.28] Which is probably why they're doing it but then are you going to lose your hardcore audience that is gonna truly drive the whole game
[1308.28 → 1310.28] Because there's always your backbone
[1310.28 → 1311.28] Okay
[1311.28 → 1312.28] Which is the hardcore guys
[1312.28 → 1326.28] Tell me this though is a gamer a fan of Elder Scrolls or a fan of single-player large exploratory world RPG
[1326.28 → 1341.28] I think you can be a fan of both separately and the idea with what I think okay what I think a lot of the purest Elder Scrolls fan were wanting with this was a little bit of a change with the others with the MMO scene
[1341.28 → 1348.28] They didn't want it to be okay Wow was released X amount of years ago everyone says everything's a wow clone Wow was a clone of a bunch of other things
[1348.28 → 1350.28] Wow's changed so much since it launched
[1350.28 → 1353.28] No exactly everything's a clone of everything if you want to call it that but whatever
[1353.28 → 1354.28] There are swords
[1354.28 → 1356.28] Yeah oh my god it's the same game
[1356.28 → 1358.28] It's a clone of 1612
[1358.28 → 1359.28] There's medieval weaponry
[1359.28 → 1365.28] Anyway everything's kind of clone of everything, but I think they want it to deviate a lot
[1365.28 → 1370.28] They want it to be an MMO game where well like one of the things is there can be a king like a singular king
[1370.28 → 1374.28] And there are wars going on all the time there's like all these slightly different things
[1374.28 → 1379.28] So kind of like Eve online then where there's there's an actual you can actually rise to power
[1379.28 → 1380.28] You can build corporations, and you can rise to power
[1380.28 → 1388.28] This I think is more official officially a king instead of just one corporation kind of just dominating everyone you're actually the king
[1389.28 → 1393.28] And you would become king maybe it's kind of like the South Park episode
[1393.28 → 1395.28] I wish I knew more I wish I knew how you became king
[1395.28 → 1397.28] Because then you'd want to be king
[1397.28 → 1400.28] Or maybe this changed and like because I read this a long time ago
[1400.28 → 1401.28] Right
[1401.28 → 1402.28] So this might have even changed I don't know
[1403.28 → 1409.28] But like they're trying to change a bunch of things I just hope they change the right things and don't just totally ruin it
[1409.28 → 1413.28] Because yeah to me Elder Scrolls game first person
[1413.28 → 1416.28] And I only played Oblivion, so I
[1416.28 → 1422.28] And like okay there was uh Oblivion MMO or whatever the mod so that people could play multiplayer
[1422.28 → 1424.28] Yes, but that was like horrendously broken back when I played
[1424.28 → 1425.28] Oh yeah of course
[1425.28 → 1426.28] Okay
[1426.28 → 1430.28] And then I 99.9% sure there's I know there's Skyrim MMO
[1430.28 → 1431.28] I don't know how well it works I haven't tried it
[1431.28 → 1433.28] I tried Oblivion MMO
[1433.28 → 1434.28] Right
[1434.28 → 1435.28] I have not tried Skyrim MMO
[1435.28 → 1437.28] Because of the experience with Oblivion MMO?
[1437.28 → 1439.28] No, no no I've wanted to I just haven't really had the time
[1439.28 → 1440.28] Okay
[1440.28 → 1445.28] Um I still kind of plan to because it's going to be a while until Elder Scrolls Online comes out
[1445.28 → 1446.28] Okay
[1446.28 → 1449.28] But anyway um and like a lot of people like these things and people are fighting so hard for that
[1449.28 → 1454.28] And that's no changes just multiple people in the game that wasn't even made for multiple people
[1454.28 → 1456.28] And people like that
[1456.28 → 1459.28] Why change core game mechanics?
[1459.28 → 1462.28] Just move the game to a realm that makes more sense
[1462.28 → 1464.28] Because and this is the argument that I would make
[1464.28 → 1469.28] An Elder Scrolls player is not necessarily um an MMO player
[1469.28 → 1471.28] They have to appeal to a completely different player
[1471.28 → 1473.28] They may have never even played an Elder Scrolls game
[1473.28 → 1477.28] Because they're one of those like girlfriends of gamers
[1477.28 → 1480.28] Who around the time WoW launched got hooked
[1480.28 → 1484.28] So gaming got its hooks into them, and they've played nothing but maybe WoW
[1484.28 → 1486.28] And maybe some other games since then
[1486.28 → 1489.28] But they've never actually tried that single player RPG genre
[1489.28 → 1492.28] But then that comes into like I want
[1492.28 → 1495.28] And I'm not trying to generalize girls can be gamers
[1495.28 → 1497.28] Every time I make a comment like that someone
[1497.28 → 1499.28] Someone sends me a message and tells me I'm wrong
[1499.28 → 1500.28] It's not what he means
[1500.28 → 1501.28] It's not what I mean
[1501.28 → 1505.28] It's just generally speaking my audience is 97% male
[1505.28 → 1506.28] Okay?
[1506.28 → 1507.28] That's all I have to say
[1507.28 → 1514.28] Why let the whole entirety of MMOs change you?
[1514.28 → 1517.28] Why not try and change what's going on?
[1517.28 → 1519.28] Why conform to everything else?
[1519.28 → 1521.28] Why like why not change the game?
[1521.28 → 1523.28] Why just do what everyone else wants you to do?
[1523.28 → 1526.28] Because every time someone tries to change something
[1526.28 → 1527.28] It ends up being
[1527.28 → 1528.28] Not honestly does it right
[1528.28 → 1529.28] Free to play
[1529.28 → 1531.28] And then the servers just shut down
[1531.28 → 1532.28] Oh
[1532.28 → 1533.28] Oh
[1533.28 → 1536.28] You know free to play I don't think is necessarily a good thing
[1536.28 → 1539.28] Team Fortress 2 was better before it became free to play
[1539.28 → 1542.28] You didn't have a bunch of silly hats
[1542.28 → 1545.28] And the fact that there was a barrier to entry to own it
[1545.28 → 1547.28] I think kept some of the riff-raff out
[1547.28 → 1548.28] That's that's
[1548.28 → 1550.28] And is this just me being an elitist jerk?
[1550.28 → 1551.28] No I actually don't think so
[1551.28 → 1554.28] The barrier to entry is kind of a big deal
[1554.28 → 1557.28] Because then also there isn't people that are just like
[1557.28 → 1560.28] Oh yeah I can screw around and piss off everyone
[1560.28 → 1562.28] Because my account banned and just be like
[1562.28 → 1564.28] Whatever's got another account
[1564.28 → 1565.28] Right exactly
[1565.28 → 1566.28] I mean
[1566.28 → 1567.28] The community isn't strong
[1567.28 → 1568.28] They will troll
[1568.28 → 1571.28] When you had to actually pay to use the thing
[1571.28 → 1574.28] I think the incentive to treat her correctly
[1574.28 → 1577.28] Well okay hold on this analogy is breaking down
[1577.28 → 1578.28] Oh
[1578.28 → 1579.28] Whoa
[1579.28 → 1581.28] Take a couple of steps back there
[1581.28 → 1582.28] Oh my goodness
[1582.28 → 1583.28] Okay let's just
[1583.28 → 1584.28] Yeah new topic
[1584.28 → 1585.28] Hey Linus do you speak French?
[1585.28 → 1595.28] Non JE NE pale pas LE Français main JE l'ai wait de risen long temps
[1595.28 → 1596.28] Queue chose come CA
[1596.28 → 1598.28] I used to be able to speak a little bit of French
[1598.28 → 1601.28] My accent's not as bad as some people
[1601.28 → 1603.28] But honestly it's mostly fallen apart
[1603.28 → 1605.28] Northeast Texas apparently has snow
[1605.28 → 1606.28] Just not a lot of snow
[1606.28 → 1608.28] Well you need a lot of snow for snowboarding
[1608.28 → 1612.28] So I think we're going to go with the original comment there
[1612.28 → 1614.28] Snowboarder here
[1614.28 → 1615.28] Very good
[1615.28 → 1617.28] Thoughts about Virtue MVP 2.0 software
[1617.28 → 1618.28] We've played around with some of it
[1618.28 → 1621.28] I think we talked about this a fair bit back when Z77 launched
[1621.28 → 1624.28] So if you check out some of the NCI Tech Tips episodes from around that era
[1624.28 → 1628.28] Will G860 bottleneck GTX 650
[1628.28 → 1630.28] A GTX 650 is a really slow card man
[1630.28 → 1634.28] You're going to want to get yourself a 7770 or a 7750 on the Radeon side
[1634.28 → 1637.28] 650 Ti is a much more competitive card
[1637.28 → 1641.28] But the 650 is actually a GPU change lower
[1641.28 → 1642.28] And it's much slower
[1642.28 → 1644.28] If you're going for that tier of pricing
[1644.28 → 1646.28] 7770 has been benchmarking really well
[1646.28 → 1650.28] 7770 has been actually just blowing the doors off of our expectations lately
[1650.28 → 1652.28] The AMD Never Settle drivers have
[1652.28 → 1657.28] I mean it's funny because we never used to do
[1657.28 → 1661.28] Taking a game and then taking a bunch of different GPUs
[1661.28 → 1664.28] Like our head-to-head GPU comparisons we've been doing lately
[1664.28 → 1666.28] We never really used to do that
[1666.28 → 1667.28] And those are cool
[1667.28 → 1669.28] I like doing those benchmarks more than almost any other benchmark
[1669.28 → 1672.28] Those are fun because it gives us a perfect idea of
[1672.28 → 1675.28] Hey, here if you have 200
[1675.28 → 1676.28] Because that's how people shop
[1676.28 → 1679.28] They go, okay, I've got $200 of Christmas money
[1679.28 → 1682.28] Or holiday money or whatever holiday
[1682.28 → 1683.28] Okay, don't worry about it
[1683.28 → 1685.28] I've got $200 to spend
[1685.28 → 1687.28] I want a graphics card
[1687.28 → 1688.28] What should I buy?
[1688.28 → 1689.28] That's how you actually shop
[1689.28 → 1692.28] So that's why we're going, okay, here are the pricing tiers
[1692.28 → 1694.28] And since we started doing that
[1694.28 → 1699.28] We started doing them after AMD launched their original Never Settle driver in November
[1699.28 → 1703.28] Which increased performance on their graphics cards up to like 30-40%
[1703.28 → 1704.28] Huge, absolutely huge
[1704.28 → 1707.28] Huge numbers in real AAA titles
[1707.28 → 1709.28] And it was extremely exciting
[1709.28 → 1711.28] And before that whenever we'd done any testing
[1711.28 → 1714.28] AMD was sort of lagging behind Nvidia
[1714.28 → 1717.28] With the 7000 series and the 600 series
[1717.28 → 1718.28] And the 600 series
[1718.28 → 1719.28] But since then
[1719.28 → 1721.28] It's actually gone completely the other way
[1721.28 → 1722.28] Plus you get all those free games with it
[1722.28 → 1724.28] Those game bundles are nuts
[1724.28 → 1725.28] You know what?
[1725.28 → 1727.28] Like they're giving you stuff that isn't even released yet
[1727.28 → 1728.28] I know
[1728.28 → 1729.28] Like way back in the day
[1729.28 → 1732.28] It would be like, oh, I got this random racing game with my graphics card
[1732.28 → 1735.28] And it's just kind of weird that no one plays it
[1735.28 → 1736.28] Yeah
[1736.28 → 1737.28] It's just like, okay
[1737.28 → 1740.28] Or you'd get like some MMO game that's like empty
[1740.28 → 1741.28] Yeah
[1741.28 → 1744.28] It's like, no one plays this because it was released like 7 years ago
[1744.28 → 1745.28] Yeah
[1745.28 → 1747.28] I remember someone was giving away like City of Heroes
[1747.28 → 1749.28] Like years and years after release
[1749.28 → 1750.28] I was like, come on, really?
[1750.28 → 1751.28] What are you doing?
[1751.28 → 1752.28] What are you doing?
[1752.28 → 1755.28] It's going to go free to play in a couple of months anyway
[1755.28 → 1756.28] Yeah, exactly
[1756.28 → 1757.28] It's like, yay!
[1757.28 → 1758.28] What's going on?
[1758.28 → 1760.28] But then now it's like huge titles
[1760.28 → 1761.28] Yeah
[1761.28 → 1764.28] Crisis 3, Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider, Bios hock Infinite
[1764.28 → 1765.28] Like massive titles
[1765.28 → 1768.28] And like a lot of times unreleased possibly when you're buying a card
[1768.28 → 1769.28] Yeah, Hitman Absolution
[1769.28 → 1770.28] Hitman Absolution
[1770.28 → 1771.28] Triple A title
[1771.28 → 1772.28] Like all of them
[1772.28 → 1773.28] These are nuts
[1773.28 → 1774.28] And you know what's funny?
[1774.28 → 1776.28] Actually, this just leads me to another conversation topic
[1776.28 → 1779.28] You know how often I get accused of being an Nvidia fanboy?
[1781.28 → 1782.28] Actually, you probably do
[1782.28 → 1783.28] You really don't know about some videos
[1783.28 → 1784.28] Yeah, I'm trying to think right now
[1784.28 → 1785.28] How many average do I think I see?
[1785.28 → 1788.28] Like on each video where we talk about graphics cards
[1788.28 → 1790.28] There's a good like whack of them
[1790.28 → 1792.28] What I don't understand though is like, okay
[1792.28 → 1793.28] The first
[1793.28 → 1794.28] The last one we did
[1794.28 → 1795.28] The last one we did
[1795.28 → 1796.28] The last one we did
[1796.28 → 1797.28] What was that?
[1797.28 → 1798.28] What game was that?
[1798.28 → 1799.28] Yeah
[1799.28 → 1801.28] Okay, so what were the results on that one?
[1801.28 → 1802.28] Didn't AMD win most of them?
[1802.28 → 1804.28] It was pretty much dead heat
[1804.28 → 1806.28] Oh, right, right, right, right, yeah
[1806.28 → 1809.28] Yeah, so like per price point it was like this
[1809.28 → 1810.28] It was the previous one
[1810.28 → 1811.28] This, this, this
[1811.28 → 1812.28] Star craft
[1812.28 → 1814.28] Star craft, I saw Nvidia fanboy comments on Star craft
[1814.28 → 1815.28] Even though AMD cards
[1815.28 → 1817.28] AMD slaughtered
[1817.28 → 1819.28] And I think what was the game we did before that as well?
[1819.28 → 1820.28] Far Cry 3, right?
[1820.28 → 1821.28] Far Cry 3
[1821.28 → 1822.28] Far Cry 3
[1822.28 → 1823.28] Far Cry 3, same thing
[1823.28 → 1824.28] AMD 1 there too
[1824.28 → 1825.28] And on these videos
[1825.28 → 1827.28] Somehow I am an Nvidia fanboy
[1827.28 → 1832.28] Because we did one video showing how to benchmark Crisis 3 that was sponsored by VGA
[1832.28 → 1837.28] In fact for that matter we're going to have more sponsored by Nvidia messaging on some of our videos
[1837.28 → 1839.28] Yes, Nvidia is a sponsor of the show
[1839.28 → 1844.28] Yes, I happen to run an Nvidia GeForce graphics card in my personal system
[1846.28 → 1847.28] My wife runs a Radeon
[1847.28 → 1849.28] She got a 5870 iFIN86
[1849.28 → 1853.28] Sort of weird card selection but don't worry about it
[1853.28 → 1854.28] Whatever
[1854.28 → 1857.28] She actually used to game a fair bit
[1857.28 → 1859.28] She played a lot of Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2
[1859.28 → 1860.28] Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2
[1860.28 → 1863.28] Yeah, she even played some Supreme Commander with me which is pretty cool
[1863.28 → 1864.28] I love Supreme Commander
[1864.28 → 1867.28] Too bad Supreme Commander Forged Alliance just messed it all up
[1867.28 → 1868.28] I've probably ranted about that before
[1868.28 → 1869.28] A lot
[1869.28 → 1870.28] Yeah, I know
[1870.28 → 1871.28] That's cool
[1871.28 → 1873.28] Star craft 2, Heart of the Swarm, coming out on the 12th
[1873.28 → 1874.28] Oh, that's exciting
[1874.28 → 1876.28] Yeah, that's actually going to be awesome
[1876.28 → 1877.28] I'm really stoked
[1877.28 → 1879.28] The main one I'm going to be stoked for is the Protons release
[1879.28 → 1882.28] So like a year or two from now but whatever
[1882.28 → 1885.28] I'm really excited about the Protons release because I'm a Protons player
[1885.28 → 1888.28] But Heart of the Swarm, like they're making a lot of changes
[1888.28 → 1891.28] They responded and like directly commented
[1891.28 → 1895.28] So like I like it when there's like community interaction from the actual company that's making the game
[1895.28 → 1898.28] And their stuff was kind of outdated
[1898.28 → 1899.28] Right
[1899.28 → 1901.28] Like just the style they were doing a lot of stuff was outdated
[1901.28 → 1906.28] It wasn't that interactive for the like more mass consumer market
[1906.28 → 1909.28] Like just tons of different stuff so they adapted a lot of stuff
[1909.28 → 1913.28] If you haven't logged in Star craft in a while a lot of the changes are already implemented
[1913.28 → 1915.28] And Heart of the Swarm is coming out on the 12th
[1915.28 → 1916.28] So you should check it out
[1916.28 → 1921.28] Alright, so let's move on to our next topic for the night
[1921.28 → 1923.28] Should we do our featured build of the week?
[1923.28 → 1924.28] Did you get the...
[1924.28 → 1925.28] Yeah, I got links and everything
[1925.28 → 1926.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[1926.28 → 1927.28] Let's do our featured build of the week
[1927.28 → 1930.28] So this is extremely exciting guys
[1930.28 → 1933.28] We have just a phenomenal build to show you guys
[1933.28 → 1935.28] So just a reminder
[1935.28 → 1937.28] Every week we're taking a featured build
[1937.28 → 1940.28] And I'm just going to show you guys where these come from
[1940.28 → 1943.28] Here I'm just going to maximize this here
[1943.28 → 1946.28] This here window and switch it so you guys can actually see what we're doing
[1946.28 → 1949.28] So within the build log section of the Linus Tech Tips Forum
[1949.28 → 1951.28] Which is down here, build logs
[1951.28 → 1955.28] You go ahead and post any, you know, pictures of your rig
[1955.28 → 1957.28] It can be something you're working on now
[1957.28 → 1959.28] It can be something you worked on already
[1959.28 → 1962.28] And it's actually one of the more active sections of the forum
[1962.28 → 1964.28] You can see
[1964.28 → 1966.28] So it's the 8th of March today
[1966.28 → 1968.28] Everything down here has been commented on
[1968.28 → 1971.28] Which I think is just so positive and so cool
[1971.28 → 1976.28] To have people just contributing and commenting on each other's rigs
[1976.28 → 1978.28] And helping each other do better and all that good stuff
[1978.28 → 1982.28] I mean this is what the LinusTechTips.com community forum is all about
[1982.28 → 1985.28] And this one just absolutely stood out
[1985.28 → 1988.28] Okay, you guys are going to be looking at all my topics here
[1988.28 → 1989.28] Cheaters
[1989.28 → 1993.28] This is our featured build log of the week
[1993.28 → 1999.28] So Justin C. is the man or lady
[1999.28 → 2000.28] Although I think it would be Justine
[2000.28 → 2001.28] Justine, yeah
[2001.28 → 2002.28] Justine at that point
[2002.28 → 2004.28] Yeah, like his name is Justin
[2004.28 → 2005.28] So it's probably Justin
[2005.28 → 2006.28] If it's Justine, it's probably Justin
[2006.28 → 2007.28] Could be a typo
[2007.28 → 2008.28] We can't, and we can't make assumptions
[2008.28 → 2009.28] Yeah, we can't make assumptions
[2009.28 → 2011.28] Maybe Justin is actually her last name
[2011.28 → 2012.28] Hmm
[2012.28 → 2013.28] So it could be like
[2013.28 → 2014.28] Maybe that's the screen name
[2014.28 → 2015.28] Yeah
[2015.28 → 2016.28] And that's actually her last name
[2016.28 → 2017.28] Could be
[2017.28 → 2018.28] So none of these pictures are working
[2018.28 → 2019.28] Which is fine
[2019.28 → 2020.28] Because I was ready for that this time
[2020.28 → 2022.28] So here's a gorgeous side picture of this phenomenal rig
[2022.28 → 2024.28] So there are a few things that Justin's done that are pretty special
[2024.28 → 2028.28] So number one is he's actually managed to implement a flow meter in a way that doesn't make the rig look stupid
[2028.28 → 2029.28] Which he gets bonus points for right there
[2029.28 → 2030.28] He's managed to implement blocks on pretty much everything
[2030.28 → 2031.28] So you can see he's got a Maximus 5 formula
[2031.28 → 2032.28] He's got it liquid cooled
[2032.28 → 2033.28] There you go
[2033.28 → 2036.28] So he's actually using the integrated 3 1 inch block that is cooling his Moses
[2036.28 → 2037.28] He's got his RAM water cooled with an EK water block
[2037.28 → 2038.28] He has a lot of water cooled
[2038.28 → 2039.28] He has a lot of water cooled
[2039.28 → 2040.28] He has a lot of water cooled
[2040.28 → 2041.28] So he's got it liquid cooled
[2041.28 → 2042.28] There you go
[2042.28 → 2044.28] So he's actually using the integrated 3 1 inch block that is cooling his Moses
[2044.28 → 2051.28] He's got his RAM water cooled with an EK water block
[2051.28 → 2056.28] He has multiple radiators going on here
[2056.28 → 2059.28] And you can see he's managed some of this extremely clean tubing routing
[2059.28 → 2061.28] I mean check out this down here
[2061.28 → 2062.28] I love this
[2062.28 → 2064.28] Straight lines going into compression fittings
[2064.28 → 2066.28] And he's got it liquid cooled
[2066.28 → 2067.28] He's got it liquid cooled
[2067.28 → 2068.28] There you go
[2068.28 → 2069.28] So he's got it liquid cooled
[2069.28 → 2070.28] There you go
[2070.28 → 2071.28] So he's got it liquid cooled
[2071.28 → 2072.28] There you go
[2072.28 → 2073.28] So he's got it liquid cooled
[2073.28 → 2076.28] So here we are
[2076.28 → 2081.28] Here you go
[2081.28 → 2083.28] But here we are
[2083.28 → 2084.28] Yeah
[2084.28 → 2085.56] At carbonate
[2085.56 → 2086.28] You know
[2086.28 → 2086.70] Eliot
[2086.70 → 2087.30] Jason
[2087.30 → 2089.26] So you can see this
[2089.26 → 2090.30] Every time
[2090.30 → 2091.46] But the
[2091.46 → 2092.46] Unknown
[2092.46 → 2095.42] Now he might use the
[2095.42 → 2097.58] 1 inch block
[2097.58 → 2098.90] 3 inch buyer
[2098.90 → 2100.94] They're
[2100.94 → 2103.16] Viewers
[2103.16 → 2108.82] sake of making it look tidier in pictures this is an actual functional rig so he's got uh yeah just
[2108.82 → 2115.18] oh just an absolutely beautiful system here are we going to show the truly awesome part
[2115.18 → 2123.20] uh maybe I missed the truly awesome part but I've got his desk here oh go back go back go
[2123.20 → 2128.04] back I don't even think you saw the good part of this build what I liked it already no idea go
[2128.04 → 2131.98] where just go back to your last picture I'll try and point it out oh did I miss something you
[2131.98 → 2136.04] totally missed something okay what I missed check out the colour of everything
[2136.04 → 2144.34] the colour pay very close attention to the colour of the parts' oh wow he actually painted his board
[2144.34 → 2150.14] right in here change the LED to blue okay you have to point with the mouse wow that is
[2150.14 → 2157.24] backlighting on rogue is blue this is blue I didn't even notice this is blue the the can't see it
[2157.24 → 2162.78] but this pc express slots are blue the SATA ports are blue everything's blue but nothing on
[2162.78 → 2168.68] that board is blue that's outstanding look it's amazing that's dual d5s those are d5s yeah it's
[2168.68 → 2174.80] just like you, you have to check this like after the stream you have to check this out in way more detail
[2174.80 → 2181.58] this build is insane that's freaking awesome anyway Justin c great rig we absolutely love it
[2181.58 → 2187.08] awesome and uh guys hey post your rigs in the build log section who knows you might get chosen as our
[2187.08 → 2191.74] build log of the week uh there's absolutely no prize whatsoever
[2191.74 → 2201.14] but you get to be featured on the stream so yay uh speaking of people featured on the stream oh wait
[2201.14 → 2208.94] no I was going to go somewhere with that oh rats okay it's okay here uh hold this for a sec so speaking of
[2208.94 → 2214.94] people to feature on the stream uh we are joining a YouTube network so those of you who follow on
[2214.94 → 2220.02] Twitter uh probably already know this because I sent out some tweets about it if you follow on Facebook you
[2220.02 → 2226.00] most even more likely already know this because twitter just like is there and then just disappears
[2226.00 → 2232.46] whereas Facebook is a little bit more persistent so ah we are joining a network we are joining a network
[2232.46 → 2240.74] that is no one was able to guess it except one guy who guessed some pretty random stuff so he made three
[2240.74 → 2250.22] guesses in one tweet, and he said um Twitter intel twitter or twitch.tv and I was like i basically
[2250.22 → 2258.22] replied I was like two of those guesses are stupid but one of them is correct so a big shout-out to
[2258.22 → 2262.46] at 121 Sheldon 121 for being the one who
[2262.46 → 2269.84] by merit of his one like throwing darts in a huge arcing motion towards a dartboard
[2269.84 → 2272.94] throwing a handful of darts
[2272.94 → 2275.12] straight up in the air
[2275.12 → 2278.94] and having one of them land somewhere good
[2278.94 → 2284.90] awesome uh so yes twitch TV is going to be our YouTube network and I've had a lot of people ask me
[2284.90 → 2290.42] what exactly does a YouTube network do so examples of YouTube networks are
[2290.42 → 2292.90] uh rev3
[2292.90 → 2293.90] machining
[2293.90 → 2294.50] machining
[2294.50 → 2295.38] uh
[2295.38 → 2296.50] um t IGN
[2296.50 → 2297.50] yeah
[2297.50 → 2299.10] uh there are lots of gaming ones
[2299.10 → 2299.34] social blade
[2299.34 → 2300.06] social blade
[2300.06 → 2305.62] so what these guys do is they aggregate channels so they act as like a layer here
[2306.18 → 2311.86] that uh so I'm already a Google YouTube partner so that means that google sells ads
[2311.86 → 2317.14] and then the ads you see before my videos are ads that google sold, and they give me a cut and they
[2317.14 → 2318.18] keep a cut
[2318.18 → 2325.14] okay so ad networks what they do is they have a deal with Google that allows them to sell their own ad
[2325.14 → 2331.30] content put that in front of the videos and then they instead of Google just sort of generally selling
[2331.30 → 2336.58] ads and then doing their best to optimize the placement I mean from time to time you're going to
[2336.58 → 2342.58] see an ad for tide laundry detergent in front of my videos let's face it gamer crowd how often you
[2342.58 → 2346.98] wash your clothes or how often do you like specifically care about which brand name of
[2347.62 → 2350.74] I was gonna I was going all the way to how often you wash your clothes because I really don't
[2351.54 → 2357.30] I don't wash my clothes that often I just grab the red bottle the red bottle I go to Costco I'm like
[2357.30 → 2362.34] that is a large red bottle that says detergent on it that is exactly what I want okay so tide
[2362.34 → 2368.66] commercials maybe not that relevant for whatever reason um so what these ad networks do is they
[2368.66 → 2372.82] actually sell ads that are specifically targeted towards the content so instead of seeing a tide
[2372.82 → 2378.74] commercial you might see a heart of the swarm commercial or something like that something that's
[2378.74 → 2382.82] way more likely at least actually more relevant to your interests it's still going to be skippable
[2382.82 → 2387.22] if it's super long and still going to have all that same stuff that goes along with it but the idea
[2387.22 → 2393.38] is that by selling the content to people who are who care about delivering ads to people who are
[2393.38 → 2400.10] watching it is that they can generate higher CPMs which is the dollars per thousand views and in
[2400.10 → 2404.98] theory more relevant actual advertisements to the people who are watching it and so it should be in
[2404.98 → 2409.30] theory better for everyone so yeah nothing's really going to change on your side like there was still
[2409.30 → 2413.38] still be the skip now button that goes after five seconds and all that like all that stuff will be
[2413.38 → 2418.74] identical it's just the person that is putting that ad there is now someone else instead
[2418.74 → 2423.22] of Google and I've had some people say that they're worried that I won't be impartial you know what
[2423.78 → 2430.18] I'll always be impartial so whether you see a sponsored by intel video in front of my videos whether
[2430.18 → 2435.46] you see sponsored by NVIDIA sponsored by AMD whatever I say to you guys is still going to be what i actually
[2435.46 → 2443.30] think and twitch.tv being our channel network is not going to affect anything whatsoever because
[2443.30 → 2449.30] I spent months actually I was shopping for five months deciding on which network to go with
[2450.02 → 2457.14] because I wanted one that um that wasn't going to try to affect the content in any way I mean I'm
[2457.14 → 2462.82] always willing to take constructive criticism I hope you guys know that I read comments I read emails
[2462.82 → 2467.30] even though I don't always have a chance to reply I read all my private messages and we're pretty
[2467.30 → 2473.62] insanely transparent like we've got all of our overclocks to like the exact settings that we put
[2473.62 → 2479.14] in for all of our graphics cards online all of our like cooler tests you guys can't see this but
[2479.14 → 2484.42] whatever it's our standardized I can't drop something it's just a box okay it's our standardized cooler test
[2484.42 → 2489.06] bench I mean you can see it you know exactly what our methodology is I mean explain it every time when
[2489.06 → 2495.14] you video your test bench there's not a lot that you can hide about it so I mean numbers don't lie
[2495.14 → 2500.74] and so we give you numbers let me talk about them then we talk about them especially I talk about
[2500.74 → 2507.46] them yeah I don't really talk about them yeah uh okay so anyway the point is it's not going to affect
[2507.46 → 2512.98] the content don't worry it should just be in theory better for everyone but uh you know hopefully that
[2512.98 → 2517.54] that hopefully that holds true all right let's go ahead and let's do some uh let's see if anyone sent
[2517.54 → 2524.18] any interesting tweets to us here we use the snowboard as a test bench yeah that's actually not a bad idea
[2524.18 → 2529.62] oh wait you could use standoffs as your stomping pad how do I make a 3d editing workstation faster
[2529.62 → 2535.46] uh usually CPU upgrade or more ram would be the best ways to do that squadron yeah squadron is not a bad
[2535.46 → 2542.98] bet either I mean really a workstation should be like six to eight cores squadron 32 gigs of ram we actually
[2542.98 → 2551.54] just upgraded diesel's workstation to 32 gigs of ram where is that ram I don't in the hall there okay yeah so um
[2552.34 → 2557.22] we've got some Kingston ram that we're going to be putting in his workstation he had 16 gigs of ram and
[2557.22 → 2564.42] the guy has da Vinci resolve open all the time he's got like photoshop he's got premiere he's got after
[2564.42 → 2569.06] effects after effects open all the time so you like walk up to his computer, and it'll be like out of
[2569.06 → 2576.42] memory you're like great how are you supposed to work like this he's like I have no idea he's a diva like
[2576.42 → 2583.38] that I hope he's not watching probably is uh anyway we got him new ram so it's some Kingston ddr3
[2583.38 → 2588.90] 1600 megahertz just basic stuff it's for a workstation so we're really excited about him being able to work
[2588.90 → 2594.66] faster um not really sure where I was going with that if you had to guess how many computers could
[2594.66 → 2601.22] you build with parts lying around your house complete computers would be CPU bound yeah we don't have a lot of CPUs
[2601.22 → 2609.06] we have a lot of power supplies a lot of cases a lot of motherboards a lot of coolers we could do
[2609.06 → 2614.82] pretty much everything CPUs we'd run out yeah we'd get capped out of CPUs actually pretty quick yeah i
[2614.82 → 2621.94] think we've only got maybe because we've got our 3570k we've got our 3770k we've got our 3960x for the
[2621.94 → 2625.38] test bench are we including personal computers those aren't actually a part of no we can't count
[2625.38 → 2631.54] personal computers, and then we've got an 8350 and then a couple Apus yeah yeah that's so like actually
[2631.54 → 2636.18] quite a few but not probably as many as you'd yeah because we have a lot of other parts, but we'd hit CPU
[2636.18 → 2641.46] because we probably have anywhere between 12 and 15 power supplies yeah for comparison yeah I mean the
[2641.46 → 2646.98] the reason we hold on to them is that my new you may actually need it at some point I mean that
[2646.98 → 2651.38] sounds crazy, but we've had situations where it's like oh we have to do like a red themed build
[2652.18 → 2657.14] where's the fatality thousand watt yeah yeah exactly let's go find a black power supply with red
[2657.14 → 2662.02] sleeping fatality a thousand watt like we've got we've got stuff for different themes so that we can do
[2662.66 → 2668.42] videos right and people expect us to have this stuff on hand yeah like if we do a build where it's supposed
[2668.42 → 2672.74] to be like a red colour scheme, and we have like a blue power, so people call us out hardcore and I'm
[2672.74 → 2679.22] just like come on man you expect me to have all this stuff usually we usually do we do yes
[2681.22 → 2685.86] not the point uh could you do a shout-out to Henry brooks and Reuben horner no
[2688.82 → 2694.98] uh 2660 tis or 1680 I'd probably go dual 660 tis even though I usually don't recommend a dual GPU
[2694.98 → 2699.22] graphics solution over a single one those two work pretty well multitasking that's a very rude thing
[2699.22 → 2704.74] to say 79 50 versus NVIDIA equivalent which is better for the price for high-end gaming I'd go 79 50 if
[2704.74 → 2714.82] I was buying today comes with uh bio uh comes with crisis 3 and bios hock infinite right yes I don't
[2714.82 → 2719.78] remember if it's the higher tier one that has crisis or if it's the lower tier one that has crisis, and it's
[2719.78 → 2726.02] uh, and it like overclocks like a boss yeah awesome no it totally overclocks like a boss case and Kassel
[2726.02 → 2729.62] says he just fell off his chair yon I hope he's not asleep by now because we're totally giving him a
[2729.62 → 2734.50] should out make sure to tell them that there's a 30 off discount on those processors too I just bought
[2734.50 → 2739.54] one and got the promo yeah that's remember in the night link weekly that we filmed today I think that had
[2739.54 → 2746.26] the 30 off on it oh cool it's a 37 70k 30 off, and you get a guaranteed beanie, and then you get it a draw
[2746.26 → 2752.50] for a snowboard cool uh technology nation nope we buy stuff we get stuff from NCI we have
[2752.50 → 2757.30] manufacturers send us stuff like for example this notebook that I'm trying out for as long as I can
[2757.30 → 2764.10] get away with trying it out I really don't want to send it back I know you have to man I know acer sent
[2764.10 → 2768.42] acer sent this over for me to check out because I asked them if I could uh if I could try one in
[2768.42 → 2775.86] person because I'd seen it and I was like oh my favourite thing is the battery pack by far really why it's just
[2775.86 → 2779.94] kind of cool I wish it was integrated slightly better, but it's kind of cool yeah I wish it was
[2779.94 → 2784.02] an i honestly if I care is I had to complain about something I wish it was a little bit thicker I wish
[2784.02 → 2789.62] the touchpad was a little bit more responsive and I wish the battery life was a little longer but overall
[2789.62 → 2796.34] still my favourite notebook ever so bam why did slick shave his beard great conversation topic carry on
[2796.34 → 2804.02] we were filming a video where I had to how in depth can I go for it okay, okay so we had to film a video
[2804.02 → 2808.66] and the idea this was for Seagate so we're actually filming a video project for Seagate
[2808.66 → 2814.66] showcasing if you guys saw like okay here to be clear Linus tech tips will always be our editorial content
[2814.66 → 2821.14] whereas tech quickie will be sort of informational pieces as well as videos that we're producing
[2821.14 → 2827.14] specifically for hardware manufacturers, so this is one for Seagate's wireless plus that we're working on right now
[2827.14 → 2831.78] okay so it's I don't know if this is exactly the start no it's not the start of the video, but it's
[2831.78 → 2836.26] part way through where I come in he's walking down the street and I walk past him, I'm supposed to look
[2836.26 → 2842.10] like dishevelled up like I'm wearing a sweater and like an undershirt I'm not even wearing an actual
[2842.10 → 2846.90] shirt, and he has like hair coming out to here I have a ridiculous beard that is like totally unkept
[2847.46 → 2852.42] and just like I'm not supposed to look like I'm doing that great and I walk past him, and he's
[2852.42 → 2859.78] on a nice suit, and he has a leather briefcase and 35 no 30 bucks I paid for that it's like cheapo
[2859.78 → 2864.66] leather briefcase looks a lot more expensive no i know um and then so he's walking down the
[2864.66 → 2869.06] street on a tablet and when I walk past him, i kind of see what's on his tablet and just go like what
[2869.06 → 2873.54] i just kind of follow him along, and then he goes into a restaurant, and he's trying to eat and i just
[2873.54 → 2876.90] like slowly move closer and closer to him while I'm looking at the tablet and I'm like sitting there
[2876.90 → 2882.82] eating, and then he's like there and I'm like do you mind, and basically the idea is its um
[2882.82 → 2886.66] there the wireless plus drive is one of those drives that you can share your media content with
[2886.66 → 2891.94] multiple tablets so I'm like dude I could help you stream it to your own tablet so we're trying to be
[2891.94 → 2896.42] like yeah here 's's what this thing does but without just doing a video where we're like here's
[2896.42 → 2901.70] what this thing does buy three today and get the fourth one free call now and get a sandwich
[2903.70 → 2908.10] that'd be an awesome addition I know call now and get a sandwich I'd buy so much more stuff welcome
[2908.10 → 2914.66] to the Linus tech tips live stream call now, and you can get one sandwich like quiz no's actually goes
[2914.66 → 2918.98] out and like delivers it to your house right away in the next 20 minutes, and it won't have any mould on it
[2920.02 → 2924.66] that would be fantastic if you did ordering and when you called in you like you have to give your
[2924.66 → 2928.58] address you have to receive the product if right then because quiz no's delivers I don't know if they do
[2928.58 → 2932.42] in Canada but I know they do in the states some of them do the one in Richmond does yeah so you could
[2932.42 → 2936.34] so then they contact quiz no's and actually send a guy from quiz no's to deliver a sandwich to your house
[2936.34 → 2942.10] right then right as you order your right as you order it that would be amazing that is what Amazon
[2942.10 → 2949.62] should do next 100 okay because Amazon's whole thing now is same-day delivery right yeah so if you have
[2949.62 → 2955.70] prime and certain locations same-day delivery okay so they get a network of partners which
[2955.70 → 2961.94] they're already working on so you could actually go okay Amazon's got a promo buy this laptop get a
[2961.94 → 2968.42] free subway sandwich the subway sandwich shows up in like half an hour so you get that instant
[2968.42 → 2974.90] gratification yeah and your laptop arrives like the next day yes there's a whole new world of cross
[2974.90 → 2980.98] promotional opportunities here 100 I love if it's like uh it's like joint post on the Linus tech tips
[2980.98 → 2987.94] forum and get like a free hammer that's true what this transfers so well because you could be like
[2987.94 → 2993.78] okay pay-per-view for UFC yes, and they bring you pizza, and they bring you pizza right when you order
[2993.78 → 2999.54] exactly oh this is, and it's like built right into the price you don't even have to pick up the phone
[2999.54 → 3004.82] again and call pizza we should just be like and then all of our live streams we could just be sitting
[3004.82 → 3011.86] here flicking stacks of money it's probably too late because they all heard it okay if any of you
[3011.86 → 3018.02] implement this please give us each a quarter million dollars just just just a quarter million just a
[3018.02 → 3021.78] quarter well did I ask for too much no I don't think so I think that's reasonable I was going to ask for a
[3021.78 → 3026.66] million and then I changed my mind quarter mid that's all we're asking for we want 250 000
[3026.66 → 3037.14] us and a sandwich we want the sandwich now let's go come on oh that's the best idea ever it's fantastic
[3037.14 → 3042.90] yeah like okay buy a laptop get free sandwich okay let's talk about real things yeah let's talk about
[3042.90 → 3051.06] fine spoil sport yeah look sorry we'll talk about that later talk about that later uh okay tell
[3051.06 → 3055.62] slick to grow back the beard more comments on your beard well okay no it's horrible I hate it don't grow it back
[3057.22 → 3060.82] usually I would trim it, but it was just too ridiculous here hold on can you hold on a second
[3060.82 → 3065.86] here talk about your beard that's literally all I had to say that's all you had to say about your beard
[3065.86 → 3073.70] what are you doing again what if I just like dodge no, no no, no that's not helping actually
[3076.82 → 3081.54] now I'm just seeing your nose that's not actually better hold on we have to see your dreamy eyes focus
[3081.54 → 3087.30] assistant why are we doing this I can see every pore on your nose right now there we go those are some
[3087.30 → 3092.98] nice dreamy eyes you got so dreamy can we not can, you just come back so we can talk about tech stuff
[3092.98 → 3098.10] all right maybe if you had any topics to talk about we'd be able to talk about tech stuff humble bundle
[3098.10 → 3103.22] for a cross-platform works on android works on steam you always talk about the humble because humble
[3103.22 → 3109.78] bundle is awesome I know, but there's like it's not even like unique anymore, but the games are that's true
[3109.78 → 3114.10] okay fine talk about your humble bundle is awesome I don't remember what games are on it but humble
[3114.10 → 3121.70] bundle.com go to it super cheap I think the average right now is like 667 so if you pay like
[3121.70 → 3128.50] seven bucks it's probably a good idea to not pay seven bucks pay like an okay amount because it splits
[3128.50 → 3134.34] you can pick your split it goes to developers you can pick exactly how much each developer gets, or you can
[3134.34 → 3138.66] just say developers don't get anything you can there are charities you can pick exactly how much
[3138.66 → 3143.70] charity is good, or you can say they get nothing uh or there's humble tip and then the humble bundle
[3143.70 → 3148.98] foundation which the humble bundle foundation which runs the whole thing gets an x amount of the money
[3148.98 → 3154.90] so they can actually survive and eat um, so there's a default split which is pretty good, or you can modify
[3154.90 → 3159.30] it yourself every once in a while I'll modify it a little bit if I like is like really, really like a
[3159.30 → 3163.54] specific charity or a specific developer or whatever and what I've bought every single
[3163.54 → 3168.50] humble bundle so one time I just like maxed out the humble tip so I was like these guys probably
[3169.54 → 3174.42] like barely exist and like realistically this isn't even that much money in the end anyway so at least
[3174.42 → 3178.90] I'll try and help them out you know what they're basically like they're like able auctions like
[3180.26 → 3184.26] they all like they're like a middleman where they take stuff that get like they're uh they're just
[3184.26 → 3191.14] a publicity mechanism yeah, but the nice thing about this is it is being software it doesn't
[3191.14 → 3195.46] cost the developers more money because they're not manufacturing it or anything so they're no in
[3195.46 → 3201.38] no matter what in no way possible taking a loss because this is likely people who weren't going to buy
[3201.38 → 3206.10] your game not trying to be offensive to them, but they probably weren't going to buy your game now
[3206.10 → 3211.14] they're buying your game because it's so cheap, and it's exciting, and it's on a timer and everybody else
[3211.14 → 3216.90] is donating and blah right so like I don't know it's cool I really like humble bundle I like indie
[3216.90 → 3225.38] games uh it's cheap I pay in the end less than I would if I bought each game individually but I don't
[3225.38 → 3229.78] pay like I don't pay the minimum or I think it's like a dollar it might not even be a dollar but i
[3229.78 → 3233.86] don't pay that and I don't pay like just above the average like I pay an okay amount usually i usually
[3233.86 → 3238.42] pay just above the average so I can get the stuff do you yeah have you done humble bundle before yeah
[3238.42 → 3244.02] yeah I bought a couple different humble bundles okay yeah yeah I bought the the one I bought the
[3244.02 → 3249.30] the one was pretty epic I bought the one that came with what's that awesome world of goo I bought that
[3249.30 → 3253.46] humble bundle yeah um I think I bought like two or three of them yeah they're good yeah I bought the
[3253.46 → 3259.46] first view but then i kind of got bored with it because I never play the games really yeah I like the android
[3259.46 → 3264.58] ones actually okay because I don't really like I don't usually buy apps on my phone then I buy the android
[3264.58 → 3272.50] packs which gives me a bunch of games then I'm like okay um sword and sorcery sword and sword and
[3272.50 → 3277.62] something that was in the last android bundle is actually a ton of fun I ended up playing it on my
[3277.62 → 3283.54] phone and my computer because whatever so along those lines um
[3285.94 → 3293.14] ah yes okay I just got a message from a friend uh time stamped a little after nine I think he was
[3293.14 → 3297.94] watching us with our technical difficulties telling me I need to get fibre uh the issue is not the
[3297.94 → 3304.02] internet connection the internet connection here is fine it's 15 megabit up it's lots um but the Linus
[3304.02 → 3309.38] tech tips' forum okay I don't know if you guys have noticed or not but if you're on the forum at all you've
[3309.38 → 3316.26] probably noticed that we have a fair amount of downtime on the forum which is a big issue for us and causes a no
[3316.26 → 3326.18] small amount of headache so slick tell us the exciting news we are getting rack space in a data centre
[3328.66 → 3334.50] yes, yes a lot of our downtimes has been because the internet has been out a lot of our downtimes have
[3334.50 → 3342.18] been because power went out the power went out like twice in one day yeah, so now there's an uh uninterruptible
[3342.18 → 3348.02] power supply behind the rack and behind that is not like the behind it but like
[3349.78 → 3359.14] any anyway there's a huge diesel generator so if the power goes out and then the ups dies there's another
[3359.14 → 3365.38] thing yeah so like we're probably okay, and it's a green data centre which is cool wind and solar power
[3365.38 → 3370.42] and all that good stuff that captain planet likes um so yeah we're really excited about that we can't
[3370.42 → 3377.22] roll it out this second because we've actually shipped uh the drives we need so we shipped a plaster
[3377.22 → 3384.26] m5 PSD for our boot drive I know it's a consumer grade drive but as far as consumer grade drives go
[3384.26 → 3389.86] that's about as close to enterprise as you get um 840 pro would probably be pretty close as well
[3389.86 → 3394.18] but other than that I probably wouldn't use a sand forest drive in that kind of workload
[3395.38 → 3400.98] um so I would go for something that doesn't uh compress the data upon writing and decompress it upon
[3400.98 → 3407.46] reading so we've gone with a m5p, and then we've gone with two Western Digital enterprise storage drives
[3407.46 → 3411.62] and we're going to be running those in raid one then we're going to be running the SSD we have four bays
[3411.62 → 3417.38] right before we so what's in the fourth bay uh WD black it's just going to be used to just push to
[3417.38 → 3424.82] right okay and so the raid one will run backups over there so we'll have redundancy and backups and
[3424.82 → 3430.74] then a SSD which will actually serve mostly as a cache so there'll be so things will either go in ram
[3430.74 → 3435.30] then SSD then hard drive depending on how frequently they're being accessed, and you figured out a way to
[3435.30 → 3443.70] do that that's like good right it's okay I'll just trust you good work magic yes as long as it works
[3443.70 → 3449.62] then uh then it's all good so guys once that actually happens once that's done it should be the
[3449.62 → 3457.70] end of the downtime v bulletin 5 has gone gold now so that's gone as an issue um we're not going to
[3457.70 → 3463.62] have to deal with we had two internet outages this week there are three we had three internet
[3463.62 → 3469.54] outages there's nothing we can do about it when the internet goes out it goes out it wasn't hackers
[3469.54 → 3474.18] it wasn't anything like that it was just the internet's out yeah it's not like I can just
[3474.18 → 3479.14] unplug and replay the cable like the router is getting nothing yeah it's not on our end so
[3480.34 → 3485.06] it is what it is but uh we're getting it addressed we're getting it dealt with and once it's done we're
[3485.06 → 3488.34] going to do a major announcement we'll make a video on the YouTube channel, and we're going to be
[3488.34 → 3495.86] giving away four oh we're doing the announcement yes oh no we're talking about this we're going to be
[3495.86 → 3502.10] giving away four HTC phones that'll be a forum exclusive giveaway so if you guys aren't signed up for
[3502.10 → 3508.82] the Linus tech tips.com forum maybe don't all go there at once right now please don't we're not quite
[3508.82 → 3514.82] ready yet but be ready for this so we're giving away a one x plus we're giving away an eight
[3514.82 → 3520.02] x we're giving away two other phones I don't even remember what they are but just four awesome
[3520.02 → 3523.78] phones HTC is going to do the fulfillment so I'll never even have to have the phones I'm just going
[3523.78 → 3527.06] to send them the winners we don't even know what the requirements are going to be, yet maybe we'll
[3527.06 → 3531.46] do like an Easter egg hunt or something like that I don't know that'd be kind of fun we'll do something
[3531.46 → 3537.06] yeah mystery guitar man has done that before on his YouTube videos, and it's actually pretty fun okay
[3537.06 → 3541.30] so we'll come up with something fun for you guys but yeah we're really excited about it so
[3541.30 → 3544.98] hopefully you guys are excited too there's some other stuff in the works for the forum too we've
[3544.98 → 3550.18] honestly been holding a lot of our cards back because of the state of it is just hasn't been
[3550.18 → 3556.90] stable enough the downtime we're sorry people tin and just all this stuff but yeah oh I'm super stoked
[3556.90 → 3562.18] that's going to be awesome yeah another shout out to the mod team thanks for like even keeping it at
[3562.18 → 3568.18] least alive in the state that it is without the mod team the forum might not even really be there yeah we
[3568.18 → 3572.42] might have had to just pull it down until we found a better solution so thanks guys yeah thanks so much
[3572.42 → 3580.34] guys um speaking of other things that we're giving away, so the like for charity program is not dead at
[3580.34 → 3586.66] all so I actually have to tabulate the likes for February and the donation this month is going to be
[3586.66 → 3593.22] the Wikimedia Foundation um which was the runner-up when we did our January drive and then in that same
[3593.22 → 3597.86] forum thread I'm going to put in a poll for you guys to vote for what you want to see in March so just
[3597.86 → 3603.14] remember guys like the videos if you like them if you know what here's what we're going to do for
[3603.14 → 3610.10] march we're going to include dislikes bam yeah so have a thought on the video yeah so we're going to
[3610.10 → 3617.14] do a tenth of a cent the same that I'm doing now for dislikes so I'm not even going to tell you guys to
[3617.14 → 3622.34] like the video for charity I'm going to tell you click a button for charity even if you hate us yeah if
[3622.34 → 3630.50] you hate us just tell us you hate us interact with us guys it feeds us say hi come hang out
[3630.50 → 3635.62] well test benches feed you the hate that I get on the internet feeds me there we go actually it
[3635.62 → 3641.54] doesn't I don't feel that hated on the internet no speaking of hated on the internet 300 000 subscribers
[3641.54 → 3647.94] yay, yay we broke it today so that's uh that's actually the most exciting thing that's happened since
[3647.94 → 3654.74] 200 000 subscribers and I mean probably the most amazing thing about it is how quickly this happened
[3654.74 → 3662.90] because the move from 100k to 200k was a long time and then the amount of time it took to go from
[3662.90 → 3670.02] 200 to 300 it feels like nothing like my baby was born and several months old, and now he's 10 months old
[3670.58 → 3675.22] which means it's been like I don't know all my entire life is in terms of how long my baby's been
[3675.22 → 3682.18] how old your baby I know what's happened to me, I mean he was born uh two days after my wedding
[3682.18 → 3687.14] anniversary we finally celebrated that wedding anniversary like a month ago when we went out
[3687.14 → 3690.82] yeah yeah yeah it's been a while why
[3693.70 → 3702.82] I feel like calculus no let's start my own business right after I have a baby it'll work out all right
[3702.82 → 3707.54] there are no problems with that at all hey if you thought it was so stupid why did you join why do
[3707.54 → 3720.58] you even work here because I'm obviously an idiot yeah wait wait wait I haven't seen that much okay, okay
[3720.58 → 3728.26] he's finally okay diesel started it but he and diesel have finally got me going on adventure time
[3728.26 → 3734.74] so I watched the first two episodes last night and that's all I've actually seen so far he maintains
[3734.74 → 3740.66] that he doesn't like it I don't like it excited to watch but I really want to watch if it's entertaining
[3740.66 → 3745.62] but it's the kind of thing where you hate yourself for being entertained by it no okay stupid okay, okay
[3746.18 → 3753.46] but it's so random and off the wall that it doesn't necessarily like there's the plot is like they're
[3753.46 → 3757.30] they're going on an adventure, and they're just going to do stuff, and it's going to be awesome and then
[3757.30 → 3763.54] that's pretty much it so like I can be working on the forum I can be working on whatever okay, okay
[3764.42 → 3770.82] why don't I try and clarify it this way I like it, but it's indefensible that I like it, I can justify
[3770.82 → 3775.78] liking future you like it just because you like it right but like because Fukuyama is awesome everything
[3775.78 → 3781.30] about it is awesome, but adventure time is pretty awesome no it's random it's stupid so what random
[3781.30 → 3786.26] can be awesome yeah, but it's indefensibly awesome whereas like Fukuyama you can look at it, and you go okay
[3786.26 → 3793.38] here's the social commentary here's the like hilarious humour that has a very broad spectrum
[3793.86 → 3798.58] then there's like adventure time that's just like random, although my wife said the same thing as
[3798.58 → 3801.94] I had it on for like three minutes, and she's like this is stupid you would give me such a hard time
[3801.94 → 3807.46] for watching anything this stupid I'm like I know but I just want to watch it and even though the plot
[3807.46 → 3813.46] is very random and bounces all over the place and is stupid with characters often that you've never
[3813.46 → 3819.14] heard of just coming out of nowhere the characters are good the characters are really well-made
[3819.94 → 3823.86] Finn and Jake are awesome bubblegum princess is very well-developed like
[3824.74 → 3830.74] even the lumpy queen or I don't even know I think it's lumpy queen lumpy something like very good character
[3830.74 → 3836.02] development fairly deep characters for that style of a show like it's good for that style of a show
[3836.02 → 3841.54] exactly it's a stupid show no but I meant by that style of a show is I mean not a very focused
[3841.54 → 3847.86] linear plot I see okay well either way I'm defending this you said it's not defensible i it is
[3847.86 → 3853.06] indefensible let's rock I am going to be watching more adventure time after the stream one way or another
[3853.06 → 3861.06] so I think why don't we just all agree on that oh what else we got here today um you know what why
[3861.06 → 3864.42] don't we do a little bit of twitter q a and then I've got I think about three more topics and then
[3864.42 → 3870.74] we're probably going to wrap this up all right back to let witter maybe that's why people think I speak
[3870.74 → 3875.38] French because I'm doing that Franglais thing all the time yeah the twitter
[3875.38 → 3883.62] the archer for the win oh Linus we are all your children archer's good, but this is the weirdest
[3883.62 → 3889.78] tweet I think I've ever gotten wait what exactly as predicted actually what no, no this one
[3889.78 → 3907.70] is that's because everyone is pissed, and they have to do something like okay I didn't even think
[3907.70 → 3915.38] about this as a live stream but holy crap you just screwed up Ea like whoa Amazon is thinking of
[3915.38 → 3922.50] pulling it because they're like yeah it doesn't work no one can connect it's one of those DRM things
[3922.50 → 3926.02] so you have to be online why don't you clarify this for the viewers who don't know what the heck you're
[3926.02 → 3930.74] talking about okay sim city recently released by Ea it's it's the first sim city game in like
[3930.74 → 3936.26] 10 years something like that yeah it's been a long time sim city 2000 I think was the last one wasn't it
[3936.26 → 3941.94] or was that no I think there's one after that I think uh okay it doesn't matter yeah long time yeah it's
[3941.94 → 3949.78] been quite a while um, and so they release it and just like can't connect can't do anything you can't
[3949.78 → 3954.58] play like I don't have it so I don't know the exact things that are going on like I know with Diablo
[3954.58 → 3960.26] it was like error 32 or whatever but like sim city you just can't play like you can't connect you can't
[3960.26 → 3966.82] play DRM makes this you can't play offline which is horrible I hate that really for a sim city game
[3966.82 → 3975.06] like come on I mean I can at least with okay at least blizzard had the weak like justification
[3975.06 → 3979.78] that they're like dynamically generating the dungeon and a server's doing it, although they did that they
[3979.78 → 3986.02] had the same stupid technology in Diablo 1 mind you yeah, but the other weak justification is that
[3986.02 → 3990.02] they're using the server to distribute the loots in a way that makes it more meaningful
[3990.02 → 3996.42] I don't care make a game offline like I understand it makes the economy work better
[3996.42 → 3999.94] right and because there's an actual auction house which you can sell things for money
[4000.74 → 4005.94] okay, okay so but still annoying back to sim city there should still be an availability for offline
[4005.94 → 4009.86] single player was locked off Diablo 2 single player was locked off you can go on single player
[4009.86 → 4014.82] was locked off well exactly doesn't matter okay you couldn't sell your stuff because you could not
[4014.82 → 4018.42] go into multiplayer games back to sim city I don't want to be able to play single player I don't want
[4018.42 → 4022.90] to talk about star craft I'm not looked I'm not defending blizzard I don't think they're right but
[4022.90 → 4026.82] anyway sim city completely indefensible much like adventure time
[4031.06 → 4038.42] no do you agree that sim city's online requirement is indefensible yes much like adventure time no
[4038.42 → 4046.10] you can't, you can't complete your sentence after I say an affirmative why not because it doesn't work
[4046.10 → 4056.50] that way yes your sentence was already done no it isn't whatever continue anyway um so so so yeah i
[4056.50 → 4061.14] mean it's cool that they're doing something about it, but it's more of a damage control like we had to
[4061.14 → 4069.62] do this than just like Ea's soft and fuzzy and warm and like you have to kind of wonder like is this
[4069.62 → 4077.38] approach going to save them more money than not doing anything probably well hold on okay maybe
[4077.38 → 4085.54] this is their evil scheme what if this is a two for one sale because look at how they have see how they
[4085.54 → 4093.94] have a date that's actually after today so you've got 10 more days to buy sim city and activate it
[4093.94 → 4103.22] to get your free game so they have turned a publicity nightmare into a promotion oh that is
[4104.58 → 4112.58] that is some like I think we need to go on an adventure toward sea that is just insane okay
[4112.58 → 4116.18] like do you think that was how the meeting went like everyone's sitting around going okay how do
[4116.18 → 4123.46] we turn this into a positive because I'll buy that two for one yeah two for one sale let's turn it into
[4123.46 → 4129.86] a two for one sale because wasn't it Ea where the um the promo code thing the origin servers yeah you
[4129.86 → 4135.06] could apply the promo code to everything, and they just honoured it because it's like okay let's maybe
[4135.06 → 4143.22] ever yea mistake is a promo exactly just get more people talking about it is doesn't matter
[4144.02 → 4149.38] any publicity is good publicity how many people you think downloaded origin that weekend I got a game
[4149.38 → 4154.26] for it, i never usually ran origin when I got a game for it my roommate who didn't have origin
[4155.46 → 4162.50] jumped on and got a game for it wow so Ea is not incompetent okay I want you guys to have a whole new
[4162.50 → 4170.02] outlook on life Ea is no tea is not incompetent I would say Ea being incompetent is an outlook on
[4170.02 → 4177.70] life for many people they are actually the cleverest most devious game company ever the next thing they're
[4177.70 → 4182.66] going to do is battlefield 4 is going to come out without battle log and then everyone that was like
[4182.66 → 4189.38] holy crap battle log is terrible will buy battlefield 4 yes, or it'll come up with battle log and then
[4189.38 → 4193.70] they'll take it off after like a week or something yeah, so the original people were like how does this
[4193.70 → 4198.18] possibly still have this all the people who accepted battle log will come and then all the people who
[4198.18 → 4202.82] ran away because battle log it'll be huge news because they'll be like oh yeah we listened and we
[4203.54 → 4209.86] oh yes if anyone from Ea is watching you can't steal our ideas or if you do, we want a quarter million
[4209.86 → 4215.30] each and a sandwich and a sandwich we want the sandwich now yes all right moving on to our next topic
[4215.30 → 4223.54] actually this is another Ea topic um maybe they should start paying us okay um I would go as far
[4223.54 → 4228.26] as to say you should never pre-order a game ever again oh yeah we talked about we did talk about this
[4228.82 → 4233.86] this was like four days ago ask me why I would say that okay actually you know what let's bring this
[4233.86 → 4238.26] back to our conversation earlier about pax east so I was you were all excited because Elder Scrolls
[4238.26 → 4242.34] online was going to be at pax east and I was like who cares because it's not going to be released content
[4242.34 → 4246.90] it's going to change so whatever you're seeing actually may not even be that representative of
[4246.90 → 4252.26] the game hold on okay it might be I mean it might be, but it also might not and I said would you pre-order
[4252.26 → 4259.62] the game personally if they gave me some form of incentive to do so okay let's say they give you a dog
[4260.26 → 4265.22] a dog that follows you or something I like dogs okay exactly so they give you a dog do you pre-order the
[4265.22 → 4269.22] game probably honestly you'll probably pre-order it anyway I already have
[4272.34 → 4278.74] it is like a while ago you're pathetic hey man whatever okay fine so I love elder schools okay
[4278.74 → 4284.74] I can't help it so get this I mean i I pre-ordered star citizen I'm throwing this out there I spent 250
[4284.74 → 4289.38] bucks on my star like pre-order pre-ordered I get the ship I get the constellation
[4290.50 → 4295.14] I thought you forgot the name was I was like wow that's terrible RSI constellation
[4295.14 → 4303.70] there we go um so yes I'm getting a constellation but based on this experience you'd almost have to
[4303.70 → 4311.70] be crazy to pre-order games on March the 4th we logged into origin so we're gonna just beat up Ea
[4311.70 → 4319.70] again uh we logged into origin and slick was like hey crisis 3 is 30 off yeah oh my god I forgot about
[4319.70 → 4324.66] this completely what did you think I was gonna talk about I had no idea I was like oh you said
[4324.66 → 4329.38] you remembered what we were gonna talk about just now like minutes ago you were like yeah no because
[4329.38 → 4334.10] the pre-order thing oh when we were talking about it yeah oh no I was tying it all back into this oh i
[4334.10 → 4340.66] know this is the point now I know on March the 4th crisis 3 was 30 off I was like oh yes look it's
[4340.66 → 4346.74] probably like the like deluxe Uber stupid edition that comes with like like a sexy like shiny blue
[4346.74 → 4351.86] visor or something, and it's the awesome Uber edition but also just the normal one so it's 30
[4351.86 → 4356.66] percent off no matter which crisis 3 you buy crisis I mean has it even been selling poorly everyone's
[4356.66 → 4361.78] talking about if it's probably been selling just fine I'm pretty sure people are buying it so how do
[4361.78 → 4368.18] you feel all of you guys okay Twitter twitch chat we're gonna check out the twitch chat as well tell me
[4368.18 → 4376.58] how you feel about ordering crisis 3 at launch or ordering it before launch if you's also
[4376.58 → 4382.50] 30 bucks on Amazon there you go or ordering it pre-launch tell me how you feel about that if you
[4382.50 → 4389.14] paid full pop for it and yeah okay so here we go I see a lot of caps which is probably enough to
[4389.14 → 4394.26] explain what we're reading right now there's a lot of caps people are like it's cheaper in store anyway
[4394.26 → 4399.38] way too early for a sale I mean on the one hand it's like yeah I feel great about getting a deal on
[4399.38 → 4404.26] stuff I mean yeah discount stuff all you want I paid 60 bucks a month or 80 bucks a month ago
[4404.26 → 4411.14] uh now people are getting it for 45 50 yeah, and you paid 80 bucks someone was saying 30 bucks on
[4411.14 → 4418.34] Amazon so there you go not a good feel someone's like I got it for 30 off hahaha well yes um
[4419.94 → 4426.18] I would be spitting my nachos and orioles at the monitor okay yeah someone says pre-order sequels
[4426.18 → 4436.26] thank you great advice I'm going to pre-order bios hock 3 just for that I know it was so bad I did yeah i
[4436.26 → 4441.94] know someone says the end is near all right let's go to twitter and I pre-ordered brink that was my big
[4441.94 → 4450.34] pre-order fail oh that looked so good it just was fundamentally broken yeah who will win in a fight you
[4450.34 → 4458.42] were slick this is not on topic I got a 20 gift card for pre-ordering which is more than 30 off okay
[4458.42 → 4463.06] that is actually a very good point if you get some kind of incentive from the retailer to pre-order
[4463.06 → 4468.90] then i kind of get it because it's as good as cash and certain in-game items like your constellation
[4468.90 → 4476.18] like a dog hey man I like dogs it's pretty cool okay did you ever play fallout 3 I did not actually
[4476.18 → 4481.70] oh I'm sorry dog meat it's like one of the coolest followers he's just a dog his name's dog
[4481.70 → 4485.94] and whatever but like he's awesome I thought you were talking about actually eating dogs' no
[4487.38 → 4492.50] I'm disappointed then oh um you're a terrible person I pre-ordered from Amazon and got 23 bucks from
[4492.50 → 4497.38] Amazon what kind of difference will kudu cores make in video editing versus a competing AMD product well
[4497.38 → 4502.10] they will make a difference whereas the competing AMD product will not if you're using premier anyway
[4502.10 → 4509.38] premier with the mercury engine is kudu optimized but does nothing with AMD's open seal I would be
[4509.38 → 4509.86] blanked
[4512.66 → 4516.82] mad talking about pre-orders what do you think about the area 3 pre-order where you get alpha and beta
[4516.82 → 4524.42] access you know what I actually don't mind alpha beta access is pretty cool yeah I don't mind that i
[4524.42 → 4528.98] mean same thing with star citizen is you're getting alpha and beta access which i quite frankly you're
[4528.98 → 4534.10] still paying to test a game so but at least you're not paying to test a game after release the only
[4534.10 → 4540.10] thing that I don't like yes, yes seriously oh my goodness that was a good point um one thing I don't
[4540.10 → 4548.50] like about very early beta access and some alpha access is I will jump in there going's like a
[4548.50 → 4554.10] 10 chance my game's going to work blah blah blah like I understand all this stuff because i I enjoy testing
[4554.10 → 4559.30] things I don't know why because I'm kind of crazy yeah he runs Mozilla nightly i run nightly i
[4559.30 → 4566.26] run beta steam I run like you run beta steam because awesome it helps everybody and I don't really mind
[4566.26 → 4570.58] I like testing things it's cool I had big picture way before a bunch of people that's pretty cool
[4571.30 → 4576.82] whatever man um so I like going in and testing it I understand it's possibly not going to work I'm just
[4576.82 → 4581.78] not even going to look at you um but a lot of the times you look in the chat, and it's like oh I can't
[4581.78 → 4586.98] believe the game's not working this is alpha I paid for this why is it not working I can't believe
[4586.98 → 4593.14] this at all, and it's like come on guys it's an alpha if it's like really, really late beta maybe
[4593.14 → 4598.10] you could possibly worry like the battlefield 3 beta was fairly worrisome because people were like
[4598.10 → 4602.98] teleporting under the ground and like folding in half and this was like a week before release and
[4602.98 → 4608.18] you're like whoa I'm walking like straight and this guy's torso is just going like this around the
[4608.18 → 4614.02] middle of his body another brilliant Ea marketing strategy they release a beta version that's
[4614.02 → 4619.30] actually like months before where they're actually at in the development cycle is such an improvement
[4619.30 → 4624.66] that they're like yeah yes so they get everyone talking about how bad the beta is, but they've
[4624.66 → 4628.82] already pre-ordered anyway, and then they get everyone talking about how the release one is so
[4628.82 → 4638.42] much better, and it distracts them from the stupid launcher ye sea oh my goodness I'm from now on I'm
[4638.42 → 4643.14] going to turn every negative thing about Ea into a positive for them that's going to yes not for us
[4643.14 → 4650.34] that's going to be my new thing um Ea can change it from it's in the game to it's all a game yeah
[4652.10 → 4658.50] maybe that's what they meant which strategy game would you guys play any given day if I had a choice I'd play a
[4658.50 → 4667.70] supreme commander vanilla because I love that game no one cares what you play star craft will you please
[4667.70 → 4676.90] please start doing how-to videos is 3d nice on a 21-inch screen or is it too small for 3d well i
[4676.90 → 4683.94] can't think of any 21 21-inch screens that actually support 3d uh slick must date esther is um not
[4683.94 → 4691.46] available beholden to Ea now forget intel uh no Linus SimCity has staggered worldwide release dates
[4691.46 → 4697.78] so it isn't available in some places still ah okay, and you know what that's one thing that really
[4697.78 → 4702.98] annoys me software what are you doing software territorial really are you freaking kidding me
[4703.94 → 4710.42] like if it was so close to not being ready that in order to adapt it to a different language for a
[4710.42 → 4715.46] different region like you weren't there enough yet, and you needed another four days you have got to
[4715.46 → 4720.10] be kidding me this brings in an interesting topic too I think that if something isn't ready push back
[4720.10 → 4726.10] the release date I will be okay with it, I would rather you push back the release date than release
[4726.10 → 4730.90] something that is just broken what if they release something somewhere else and don't
[4730.90 → 4736.42] release it to you then how do you feel because it was ready, but you just don't have it because this is the
[4736.42 → 4740.58] because this is the opposite thing this makes me upset too because assassin's creed usually comes
[4740.58 → 4747.14] out like way after console for pc yeah like come on guys that one I understand though because there's
[4747.14 → 4752.74] actual porting to be done but just get another team to do it and do it well that's expensive everybody
[4752.74 → 4761.14] else can you're okay yeah but okay this is indefensible whereas porting uh porting a game
[4761.14 → 4765.94] and that at least I agree there's some justification I think it should still be done whereas like I mean
[4765.94 → 4769.62] Yankee's whole favourite thing in the world is complaining about Australian release dates I mean
[4769.62 → 4773.86] it's English for crying out loud like they're like a month behind oh they can be even six months behind
[4773.86 → 4777.46] sometimes like it's ridiculous, and harbour releases are even worse, and it's like now that everything's
[4777.46 → 4783.14] digitally distributed like to come on I mean I know they live on an island maybe you got if you ship things
[4783.14 → 4789.38] by the slowest possible boat then maybe it takes a while but come on I get something from China to here in
[4789.38 → 4796.18] like a couple of days yeah I'm sure you can get it to Australia uh I play sim city and watch adventure
[4796.18 → 4801.62] time all the time you mad Linus I'm not mad at all about that any special videos coming up for the
[4801.62 → 4808.02] sub goal honestly no this one where we talked about yay sub goal um maybe when we hit 500k we'll do
[4808.02 → 4814.42] something special what I have no idea what you're talking about they're not for the oh yeah you can
[4814.42 → 4818.82] talk about that uh we just need to get the NVIDIA sponsor spot finished for that so
[4818.82 → 4823.70] uh our first sponsored videos by NVIDIA are going to be ones that have absolutely nothing to do with
[4823.70 → 4829.94] any NVIDIA products nothing at all sort of important for us go ahead um it's going to be 8350 versus 3570k
[4829.94 → 4836.26] Logan uh with tech syndicate released a video a while back I'm going to open up a can where he um
[4836.26 → 4842.26] does it video it's kind of cool anyway um where he does 3570k versus 8350 we're not doing the exact
[4842.26 → 4847.46] same benchmarks as him because there's realistically no point in doing that so we grabbed different
[4847.46 → 4855.30] situations different clocks yeah um antialiasing not antialiasing like different OS's we're trying
[4855.30 → 4860.34] to contribute to the conversation we're not trying to be like no yeah we're not trying to just redo his
[4860.34 → 4864.18] test no because there's no point we're taking a slightly different angle we're taking our spin on
[4864.18 → 4871.54] it and going okay here's what our findings are 8350 versus 3570k, and they're interesting best mid-range
[4871.54 → 4876.42] processor and video card for video editing I would probably say 8150 and like a GTX 660
[4877.78 → 4882.90] because then you get kudu course it's only 200 bucks each and do a little text file hack thing
[4882.90 → 4886.58] yeah yeah you just said you have to do a text file hack to get the mercury engine enabled it's everywhere
[4886.58 → 4891.94] online though just looking yeah it's like all over the place uh slick is fired again some guy says he's
[4891.94 → 4899.94] been playing for the last uh six hours, and it's all good there you go five percent uptime yes no
[4902.02 → 4906.50] Linus will you upgrade to GTX titan now that there are water blocks for it no I won't uh because i only
[4906.50 → 4911.54] have one, and so I need that one in fact I think nope that's not it I don't know where it is um i only
[4911.54 → 4916.98] have one and I need that one to bring comparative benchmarks to you guys until GTX titan is discontinued and
[4916.98 → 4923.54] not relevant anymore, so my personal rig is still going to have a GTX 590 until I get around to
[4923.54 → 4928.26] changing it and based on how long it's taken me to build it this time six years that might be a while
[4928.74 → 4935.06] uh when will 4k monitors 120 hertz IPS panels and 16 gig ram dims PCIE 4 come out thank you
[4936.98 → 4941.38] you and I are both open for all those things all the unknown release dates release them all in this
[4941.38 → 4948.50] stream right now that you don't know yeah January 26th the 2014 is when we're going to see PCIE 4 i
[4948.50 → 4954.26] don't know um january 26, 2014 is when all of those things are slick just come out we all know you're a
[4954.26 → 4961.70] barony you are a barony are you oh it was diesel who's a barony right yes, yes diesel is a barony I know one
[4961.70 → 4966.98] of you was talking because they explained what no diesel has a friend that's like a hardcore barony that
[4966.98 → 4971.46] runs a club or something yeah but I'm pretty sure diesel like watches a little bit too I don't know
[4971.46 → 4975.62] I get the I'm not going to make accusations I hope I'm not getting text messages from him right now
[4976.18 → 4980.74] just make sure that uh it wasn't actually diesel though I don't think it was diesel
[4980.74 → 4985.94] wasn't he I think it's his friend yeah, but that's I mean how often do conversations start with my friend
[4985.94 → 4990.42] my friend got touched in a bad place, and he's not sure what to do that was a weird way to take that
[4991.46 → 4994.82] weird little kind of a weird direction well yeah but I mean come on how often is that it
[4994.82 → 5000.34] it's not no I know what you mean I know what you mean um all right would love to know what other
[5000.34 → 5006.34] people have purchased directly because of you h100 sonar STX and hd598 those are good things to buy
[5006.34 → 5011.62] because of us you got all the right ideas sir or ma'am uh what kind of difference will comp de corps
[5011.62 → 5017.38] is making oh I think someone's already asked that age of empires 2 HD coming in April you know what
[5017.38 → 5023.22] I would actually love to see this as a trend old games just getting makeovers and being released exactly
[5023.22 → 5028.02] the same way oh my goodness I'd be so happy I have no problem with that tie fighter with like sweet
[5028.02 → 5034.18] good graphics I'd be so down for that like descent 2 do you ever play descent no I didn't oh
[5034.18 → 5039.38] my goodness like oh so much fun I mean you know what the funny thing is this has existed I mean
[5039.38 → 5043.46] valve keeps releasing the same stupid terrorist versus counter-terrorist game over and over again
[5044.18 → 5049.22] Final Fantasy doesn't look like crazy yep well uh yeah, but they change it that's the problem
[5049.22 → 5053.70] yeah and you know what they've done re-releases though you're right yeah yeah they did a DS re-release
[5053.70 → 5060.82] of two and one, and they did a PlayStation re-release of six like just people like it man just do it
[5060.82 → 5067.78] every once in a while grab like your most successful titles and just I mean okay someone if is uh
[5067.78 → 5075.70] if square Unix redid krone trigger just like word for word redid it with better graphics I would say
[5075.70 → 5080.66] it's so happy I'd play it at least a couple more times like and like this isn't because happily pay
[5080.66 → 5085.70] for it this is honestly because when I go back to play some of these games some of some of them
[5085.70 → 5090.74] don't age well yeah that's what I mean some of the art styles actually age incredibly well and I'm like
[5090.74 → 5096.18] don't even like don't update that you don't need to yeah it kind of looks good in that way but then
[5096.18 → 5101.54] there are other ones like borrowing did not age well no it didn't if I go back and try and play vanilla
[5101.54 → 5108.26] borrowing I'm like oh, oh this is gross, but then there's like there are tons of mods you can make
[5108.26 → 5113.54] it looks great but I'm just saying vanilla borrowing while I love it looks kind of grotesque yeah that
[5113.54 → 5119.70] that's going to be freaking awesome 7870 mist edition it's a Tahiti based 7870 yeah I mean that's not
[5119.70 → 5126.82] really a 7870. oh, no trigger for DS it's on DS oh okay well we just got told we apparently don't follow
[5126.82 → 5131.38] mobile gaming enough you know what my DS light has been broken for so long that it doesn't matter
[5131.38 → 5136.26] any more we actually took it apart when i got my i fix it screwdriver set and the shoulder button was
[5136.26 → 5140.42] not fixable we got one of them working yeah one of them was fixable the other one wasn't so I'm
[5140.42 → 5147.46] my DS still works so I'm probably going to play krone trigger for DS whatever man
[5149.38 → 5155.62] uh okay, okay i think we're down to we're down to that we're down to the creepy tweet so we're gonna let's
[5155.62 → 5160.66] move on to our next actual topic here i had another one we're in the're in the after
[5160.66 → 5165.94] party are we in the after party well the stream started late did it so is this technically after
[5165.94 → 5170.50] party or is it not quite yet i don't know how late the stream started okay well maybe we're not in the
[5170.50 → 5180.02] after party oh i got excited my bed oh yeah do you have topics oh yes oh i got a good one yes okay
[5180.02 → 5184.98] I'm excited about this one actually this one you know what i have a new thing that I'm uh where i
[5184.98 → 5189.86] always put it down out there just thank you um you put your hand on it, i also have a new thing that
[5189.86 → 5195.14] I'm doing on the forum so we're going to have our featured builds and then I'm also going to have
[5195.14 → 5203.06] featured news items so if you guys post in the news and reviews from around the web section um
[5203.06 → 5209.22] there is a chance that you will have your thread featured on the live stream which uh obviously
[5209.22 → 5214.10] will be very fulfilling for you, it might not but whatever man I'm still going to do it anyway, so this is
[5214.10 → 5219.30] the tech news and review section go ahead and go in there this thread right here by techfinette
[5219.30 → 5227.94] that it is extremely exciting i think you're supposed to say tech fanatic yeah don't worry about it
[5228.98 → 5236.10] tech fanatic thank you there we go good work you're unfired um so the PlayStation 4 will have phys
[5236.10 → 5246.74] and apex support in spite of the fact that the PlayStation 4 runs on AMD hardware okay so this is
[5246.74 → 5252.02] this means a lot of things, so there's oh man there are so many different ways to go at this
[5252.02 → 5259.30] so number one is NVIDIA where was phys support on the desktop two years ago because you know what
[5259.30 → 5264.18] their claim was is it's not validated for the platform and why should we develop for that in
[5264.18 → 5269.38] spite of the fact that i mean over and over again people were taking and i mean oh this goes even oh okay
[5269.38 → 5276.34] okay, okay just gotta calm down it's okay you'll be okay so the thing that NVIDIA was refusing to
[5276.34 → 5282.42] support was an AMD graphics card with an NVIDIA dedicated card running physics people were even
[5282.42 → 5286.90] willing to go that far look i want to run an AMD card I'm willing to buy an NVIDIA card and put it in
[5286.90 → 5293.30] in a secondary role just to power physics that would have been a pretty cool middle ground for NVIDIA
[5293.30 → 5297.78] because they still get to sell you a graphics card yeah, and they said no it's not supported because and
[5297.78 → 5303.70] they gave reasons like it's uh you know unsupported platform it's not part of the correct ecosystem and
[5303.70 → 5309.46] i understand all those things except that it was usually a simple hack that someone could implement
[5309.46 → 5314.34] to get it working, but then the next driver release would intentionally break it so it became like this
[5314.34 → 5320.98] arms race of people fought it like i know people that ran physics cards people hardcore fought it um so
[5320.98 → 5327.06] now they're taking it one step further, and they're going okay we are not only going to allow physics
[5327.06 → 5335.62] in a radio on graphics powered system we are going to allow physics on AMD hardware so that means to me
[5335.62 → 5342.34] that it is supported on AMD hardware for one thing like definitely works on AMD hardware it means they
[5342.34 → 5348.18] must have known about this for a while if it's being announced like so close to the PlayStation i mean
[5348.18 → 5357.22] if is NVIDIA has enough details about the next generation AMD hardware that's going into PlayStation
[5357.22 → 5363.22] 4 i don't think it's using gun is it i honestly haven't looked enough into the console specs or
[5363.22 → 5367.62] GNC or generation x core whatever one i don't remember, but they know enough about AMD's
[5367.62 → 5371.46] architecture to know it works which means they know it works um
[5371.46 → 5380.50] um and so yeah so they're so they're doing it for console, but they're not doing it for but they
[5380.50 → 5386.74] haven't done it for desktop and so their messaging is multi-platform support is critical
[5386.74 → 5391.54] for developers with physics and apex support for PlayStation 4 consumers can look forward to better
[5391.54 → 5400.26] games and this is all very cool i mean i love the idea of physics love it every game should have NVIDIA
[5400.26 → 5406.02] physics, and it should be a core part of gameplay why does it not work that way because AMD still
[5406.02 → 5413.06] exists and physics doesn't run on AMD hardware so as a game developer how can you build a game that's
[5413.06 → 5418.98] not going to run on 20 30 40 50 60 however many percent of the gaming machines that are out there
[5418.98 → 5423.78] it's impossible so you're going to end up with like tin cans that you can kick around and your character
[5423.78 → 5430.02] will kick them and more particles and stuff like that i think this is ranks up there for the most
[5430.02 → 5435.22] rattled that you've like ever been on a live stream this is a very, very deep topic guys
[5435.86 → 5440.82] okay what are you telling me your thoughts while i totally agree i just i haven't looked into this
[5440.82 → 5444.74] nearly as much as you have I haven't looked into it much either this is all i know it things that
[5444.74 → 5449.30] rattle me what does this mean to you think that rattle me are like borderlands when borderlands
[5449.30 → 5454.02] came out look at the physics comparison with it on and off there's stuff in there that could have been
[5454.02 → 5460.34] done yes it was just removed like it's that's what rattles me about that kind of stuff is when
[5460.34 → 5466.02] you're like no you could do this, but we're just going to take a little bit more than what we actually
[5466.02 → 5471.38] created on the other hand if they did help develop it i know then they don't have to let, but they're
[5471.38 → 5476.10] making technology use it, but it's not even that that could be done by things aren't that aren't physics
[5476.10 → 5482.98] that's right that you watch the demo but if NVIDIA helped the game developer right, but it's artificial
[5482.98 → 5489.22] uh, uh artificial differentiation is it artificial okay here look at it this way if you're the game
[5489.22 → 5493.86] dev, and you don't have the resources to make really cool particle effects in your game it's not going to
[5493.86 → 5498.66] make it to the release version and i come in and i say look I'm going to give you some coders I'm going
[5498.66 → 5505.46] to give you some money I'm going to help you get this done, but we want to do it this way okay it's gearbox
[5505.46 → 5514.58] okay yes pretty sure they're okay, but they still have budgets every game company has a budget
[5514.58 → 5522.18] whether they have unlimited money or not yeah so okay i just i guess like i don't know what happened
[5522.18 → 5526.90] i can speculate that NVIDIA came around and was like to we'll do this for you and gearbox was like okay we can
[5526.90 → 5531.94] lower our budgets okay so what does this mean for the desktop because think about it this way
[5532.90 → 5537.86] physics this could mean that it's coming to the desktop it could, or it doesn't but think about
[5537.86 → 5545.30] it this way because we've seen this over the last five years ten years however far back you want to go
[5545.30 → 5551.54] the way that gradually console game development has driven the way that pc games are developed this is
[5551.54 → 5560.02] where you're going this is where I'm going with this so is NVIDIA by enabling this technology on now
[5560.82 → 5567.38] because before it was always this one platform pc, and it was on let's say for the sake of argument
[5567.38 → 5571.54] NVIDIA and AMD have 50 market share i know for a fact they don't, but we're just going to say that
[5571.54 → 5578.42] let's say they're each 50 it was going to enable this technology on 50 of one platform that's less than
[5578.42 → 5584.42] a third of the overall market share so it was less than a sixth of the 10 the total addressable market
[5584.42 → 5591.54] okay now if NVIDIA enables this technology on both next generation consoles because this is only saying
[5591.54 → 5598.42] PS4 but I'm assuming it's going to be on Xbox 720 as well and on NVIDIA desktops all of a sudden that
[5598.42 → 5604.26] is now five sixth of the available 10, and it's probably actually more than that because console is very
[5604.26 → 5611.94] um big yeah so let's say let's say it's seven eighths even that i think is conservative now what
[5611.94 → 5620.42] happens to AMD desktop graphics cards owners who don't own physics enabled hardware but the game
[5620.42 → 5630.58] has core gameplay that is physics dependent now what so is this NVIDIA bending and doing something that
[5630.58 → 5636.50] enables better gameplay and all that and i believe it do i believe in physics i believe it can make
[5636.50 → 5641.70] better gameplay 100 so are they doing it out of the goodness of their hearts to give everyone better
[5641.70 → 5649.06] gameplay or are they doing this to crush to create a very small niche on the desktop market where AMD's
[5649.06 → 5654.74] cards can't be competitive that's interesting at the same time as i said last live stream, and it's kind
[5654.74 → 5658.74] of developed a bit this time a lot of developers are coming out saying they're going to start with the
[5658.74 → 5664.34] desktop and port down okay that's true, but that doesn't change the fact that if they start on
[5664.34 → 5668.10] the desktop there's still physics on the desktop they're still developing NVIDIA, but they're probably
[5668.98 → 5674.58] i don't know if they i guess it completely comes down to developers okay remember though you're the
[5674.58 → 5680.42] person making the decision is not necessarily a gamer no i know the person making the decision is going
[5680.42 → 5685.62] okay we want to deliver cutting edge technologies like you know that splash screen at the beginning of
[5685.62 → 5695.06] the game bank video engine cry engine 3 physics or whatever else it says they want to put a bunch of
[5695.06 → 5701.22] those stamps on there they want it to seem like high-tech and sweet they want to hit as large a market
[5701.22 → 5708.74] as possible do you put physics in your game it's and this will like it obviously won't be all games as
[5708.74 → 5715.22] well because not all games need physics i think pretty much anything could benefit from it in some
[5715.22 → 5720.10] way maybe yeah okay tell me a genre that wouldn't benefit from physics i was just going to say platformer
[5720.10 → 5725.78] but then you still could oh yes you still totally oh yes like definitely physics platformers are awesome
[5725.78 → 5734.18] yeah okay what's next I'm kind of our yeah RTS oh physics battles oh old school line versus line
[5734.18 → 5742.98] combat yeah exactly even that could benefit from physics if you had like if you like multi multi-target you
[5742.98 → 5748.66] could have power-ups that change the composition of the paddle and the ball and calculate differently
[5748.66 → 5754.26] or you could bend your thing, and it could be like you know perfect whatever, or it doesn't matter anything
[5754.26 → 5760.66] can benefit from real-time physics i think along with uh virtual reality physics in a big way is the
[5760.66 → 5767.14] next big evolution his x with Oculus Rift oh and adding like i mean you showed me that demo a little
[5767.14 → 5775.86] while ago where it was um each time we 10x the number of triangles on a 3d object the actual
[5775.86 → 5781.46] benefit for each 10 times amount of processing power like some of the worst diminishing returns we've ever
[5781.46 → 5786.02] seen yes like it's like nothing after a certain point, and you can look at the Tomb Raider game with
[5786.02 → 5791.30] the super realistic hair or whatever else and that's powered by AMD's uh GPU compute by the way not
[5791.30 → 5798.50] phys but anyway so it turns out they can do physics calculations on AMD GPUs um so you look at even some
[5798.50 → 5809.30] very recent games like that, and it's kind of like okay um okay so again we're not getting a benefit from
[5809.30 → 5814.98] more triangles and smoother surfaces we're getting a benefit in realism from physics hair i mean even your
[5814.98 → 5821.78] stupid 2d side scroller the character can have realistic hair so yeah that's stupid, so there's
[5821.78 → 5826.90] two ways to look at this either you look at it and go holy crap what does this mean for AMD on the
[5826.90 → 5833.06] desktop, or you look at it, and you go holy crap what does this mean for gamers in general how cool of it
[5833.06 → 5839.62] how cool of NVIDIA would it be to go look we're still going to call it NVIDIA physics, and we're gonna
[5839.62 → 5844.34] maybe they give you like a bonus of some sort for using NVIDIA maybe it runs better on NVIDIA hardware
[5844.34 → 5850.42] even if they software limited whatever, but we're going to open it up for every platform so now
[5850.42 → 5856.50] physics can become a core part of gameplay on every major platform how that excites me as a gamer as
[5856.50 → 5863.14] a hardware nerd it kind of scares me a little bit okay well consolidation scares you in general yeah
[5863.14 → 5869.22] i hate consolidation so that kind of freaks me out but then as a gamer I'm like yeah i know physics games
[5869.22 → 5874.90] ah so i don't know very conflicted well we're definitely after party now in fact I'm kind of
[5874.90 → 5883.38] getting tired so um after party did you hear about the chick in China who got a bottle of moisturizer
[5883.38 → 5894.58] oh no oh yes I've heard of this oh god 300 bucks that was the fine yeah why don't you tell them what
[5894.58 → 5901.70] happened while i see if I'm missing anything here okay oh wait quick shout out to mark Thompson who
[5901.70 → 5908.18] hooked us up with a water-cooled uh GTX 280 graphics cards that we're using for a demo build in the silver
[5908.18 → 5914.50] stone tj10 thanks mark you're awesome thanks dude yeah you're awesome okay so i don't even want to say
[5914.50 → 5921.30] this because this is putrid but um oh i don't know was it a secret admirer or just an admirer just like
[5921.30 → 5927.38] i think he was a secret admirer okay, so this could be wrong but going with secret admirer liked some chick
[5927.38 → 5931.22] i don't know if she's special in any way but liked some chick like i don't know if she's famous or
[5931.22 → 5937.38] anything liked her an awful lot liked her a lot and couldn't figure out how to express his like for
[5937.38 → 5947.06] her um or like fanatic level of love for her um but sent her a bottle of was it labelled as moisturizer
[5947.06 → 5951.70] yeah moisturizer so it was labelled as moisturizer it was supposed to be moisturizer, and it was an
[5951.70 → 5959.94] entire bottle of his sperm yeah well probably some seminal fluid as well, well yeah yeah so like
[5959.94 → 5966.34] so it wasn't she had actually and she didn't realize what it was until it was too late so it
[5966.34 → 5973.86] was actually her roommate or friend or something who smelled it and was like that's not moisturizer
[5974.50 → 5981.54] so um so get this 300 fine to the guy only 300 bucks that's disgusting like that is the most
[5981.54 → 5987.70] disgusting thing i mean for 300 i might do that to you if that's all i have to pay that is gross
[5987.70 → 5996.66] actually I'm not going to do that I'm not going to do that but 300 it's trivial okay inappropriate and
[5996.66 → 6008.82] everyone's tuning out but 300 fine that's it and um and then get this he goes on the record saying
[6008.82 → 6015.30] you know his affections were misguided and he's still going to do, but he's still going to try yeah he's
[6015.30 → 6020.18] still going to try oh my god like that you shouldn't even be allowed to like there should be an automatic
[6020.18 → 6026.02] restraining order you are a horrible person at that point in time like just leave her alone dude yeah
[6026.02 → 6037.54] just let it go man just let it go man that's just oh just let it go man because you're just no, no don't
[6038.42 → 6047.78] i feel like i feel like i feel like he needs to be treated like a dog sit no, no bad dog no although
[6047.78 → 6053.70] he might like that i you know what that's a level of creepiness that just sort of goes beyond you just
[6053.70 → 6061.46] said something that goes beyond i know but I'm not going to do it it's its a joke it's like that uh that
[6061.46 → 6066.98] arrogant worm song uh kill the dog next door it goes something something something um
[6069.70 → 6074.34] uh I'm going to kill the dog next door ain't gonna bark anymore because this is judgment
[6074.34 → 6079.06] day and the little runt has got to pay there are turds on my lawn that stupid dog will soon
[6079.06 → 6085.70] be oh kill kill kill kill kill that dog and then um uh something something
[6085.70 → 6106.82] uh and then i strangled him and then um the police came, and then he got a 300 it was a 300 fine too
[6106.82 → 6114.42] in the song yeah a 300 dollar fine wow what a good value i think I'll kill my neighbour too oh
[6114.42 → 6121.06] oh great song guys if you're not familiar with the arrogant worms they're like truly like legendary
[6121.06 → 6127.70] Canadian sort of goofy artists they do sort of uh just kind of silly songs and like Canadian themed
[6127.70 → 6132.98] songs and uh yeah anyway kill the dog next door or kill the dog next door or something like
[6132.98 → 6138.66] that good song that's that's that's where my mind was going with the joke like i it was like ah well
[6138.66 → 6146.98] it's only 300 so why don't we all do it so he kills his neighbour's dog gets 300 fine putrid i would
[6146.98 → 6153.94] actually expect a much bigger fine for the lotion thing like way bigger or just like jail time
[6153.94 → 6157.94] like i don't know something bad deportation you shouldn't be allowed to be in the same country as her
[6157.94 → 6163.06] yeah but where are you going to deport all these people to some island like Australia
[6164.98 → 6170.82] i guess they did that they did do that it's not it's not like that's the craziest thing anyone's
[6170.82 → 6175.86] ever said, or it's not the first time anyone said anything that crazy or did it or did that yeah
[6176.58 → 6184.66] because people did that thing so yeah bam you all just got banned uh Raul sued s-o-o-o-d whatever
[6184.66 → 6191.78] Raul from voodoo pc has joined racer as an advisor to the racer board of directors so they're mostly
[6191.78 → 6196.98] wanting him to be involved in the system side of the business so if you guys aren't already familiar
[6196.98 → 6202.74] racer doesn't do just gaming peripherals now they have the uh blade series of notebooks with their
[6202.74 → 6208.98] switchblade interface you know what's funny is my racer blade unboxing video got flagged as
[6208.98 → 6216.74] inappropriate content right YouTube because razor blade no i had switchblade in the video description
[6217.38 → 6223.78] so i sent them a like i contested it i was like guys there is absolutely nothing in this video that
[6223.78 → 6228.98] is in any way inappropriate i think you probably flagged it because of the switchblade in the title
[6228.98 → 6235.46] so uh basically they re-enabled it like a week and a half later and i had missed out on all the
[6235.46 → 6240.18] rad ad revenue, and it ended up being like quite a popular video I'm like come on guys like that
[6240.18 → 6245.62] that kind of stuff's not cool i mean i understand why they're they don't want ad content on something
[6245.62 → 6251.46] with the title switchblade but on the other hand it's like obviously a computer it's a software it
[6251.46 → 6255.86] was the thing on the side right clearly nobody looked at it yeah it was it's just the um the
[6255.86 → 6264.10] touch screen interface yeah yeah uh anyway so he's blah blah so uh entrepreneur with an array of
[6264.10 → 6268.82] startups he founded luxury and gaming computer manufacturer voodoo pc which was acquired by hp
[6268.82 → 6272.42] bringing with it the NB product line and its related technology and design inspirations
[6272.42 → 6276.42] additionally co-founded an array of networking and educational i just turned my laptop off so
[6276.42 → 6285.06] the point is excited or not excited about having voodoo sort of mindset uh go into racer systems because
[6285.06 → 6291.86] they're already pretty unique yeah and they kind of have their own style yeah and like if he does
[6291.86 → 6298.10] something like the use this i mean he's just an advisor so they just want advice right true okay
[6298.10 → 6305.06] so he's not actually like designing systems like the pedestal pc um i don't know i think racer is doing
[6305.06 → 6311.06] okay for their design i really like if there's anything i just wish there was more GPU power but
[6311.06 → 6315.78] they kind of fixed that on the latest one i can't complain like if i was trying to dig for things to
[6315.78 → 6320.66] complain about i couldn't completely be like oh razors design is not good because that's like they're
[6320.66 → 6326.66] beautiful exactly they look great apple calibre which i mean is good and like the packaging and
[6326.66 → 6331.30] everything like yeah like they've got design down so i don't know yeah i don't know interesting move
[6331.30 → 6334.42] i wonder what they actually need, i mean the press release was kind of interesting there's a lot of
[6334.42 → 6339.38] padding in it but uh yeah i guess I'll just be I'll just be interested to see what kind of happens yeah
[6339.38 → 6344.18] i wonder if like is they're thinking of taking like a new product line direction yeah like maybe they'll
[6344.18 → 6349.14] really like yeah i don't know like i can't imagine he needs the money at this point no probably don't
[6349.14 → 6355.22] like uh so maybe i mean he just wants to kind of get back into it a little bit and uh influence some
[6355.22 → 6363.38] i mean of the guys doing gaming notebooks innovation wise is there anyone who's doing things as
[6363.38 → 6368.58] differently as racer nope i mean is it perfect the answer is probably no and there's like a few things
[6368.58 → 6373.70] like i like that MSI integrated steel series keyboard that's true okay, okay, so guys are doing things yeah
[6373.70 → 6376.98] but i don't think anyone's breaking the mould the same way that racer yeah they're not trying to
[6376.98 → 6381.54] change the game like racer did so yeah i don't know I'm interested to see what that turns out being
[6382.18 → 6387.22] turning into whatever else and i think that's pretty much it oh yeah why are Noctua brown
[6387.22 → 6397.94] Noctua fans brand we talked about this yeah um i love Noctua fans i hate the way Noctua fans look i like
[6397.94 → 6403.54] okay they look good in some systems they look great in our thermal test bench because our thermal test bench is an
[6403.70 → 6409.78] army green, and it looks awesome with that they look awesome with that the thing is they don't suit the
[6409.78 → 6417.94] colour schemes of most systems like they can work, but they just donot suit the colour schemes of most
[6417.94 → 6425.70] systems and like so we've had a lot of people ask us why do they make their fans so well a couple
[6425.70 → 6430.90] different ways of phrasing it ugly or distinctive looking that's another way of looking at it so the
[6430.90 → 6436.26] reason they make them distinctive looking is because of this whenever you see a build online
[6436.26 → 6442.10] whether it's powered on or off you know what fan it is or if you don't, you say why did you use such
[6442.10 → 6449.54] ugly fans in your system to which the person replies they're freaking awesome and the thing is if they
[6449.54 → 6454.66] did dye them because that's possible that's a huge part of their build log anyway so like if the is you
[6454.66 → 6459.86] have Noctua fans in your system it's a notable part of your build log yes it's like it's like a status
[6459.86 → 6466.02] symbol it's like uh it's its a choice that you've made to use these fans and i personally think it's
[6466.02 → 6472.42] been an extremely positive thing for them because any amount of people talking about it is good if is at
[6472.42 → 6477.06] the end of it is always circles back to well i have them because they're awesome because they're the best
[6477.06 → 6483.22] performing fans on the market or whatever other reason audio level at a certain audible level i mean
[6483.22 → 6488.50] obviously you could buy deltas, and they'd be better performing yeah but uh if you want optimization
[6488.50 → 6492.50] then these are pretty much the way to go i mean it's kind of like uh Buckley's cough syrup yeah
[6492.50 → 6496.90] remember those commercials i love those commercials it's awful, but it tastes awful, but it works yeah
[6496.90 → 6501.22] it's like okay if I'm sick I'm probably going to go buy Buckley's yeah I'll just deal with it and I'll feel
[6501.22 → 6505.46] better that's right looking awful, but it actually works so there that's the that's the way that i see it
[6505.46 → 6512.34] it and that is it for all the topics that i had planned tonight um unless you have anything else
[6512.34 → 6516.74] you wanted to talk about not particularly you had a couple that i had and other than that
[6518.90 → 6523.46] so good night everyone a lot of people complained we didn't have enough of a good night last time so
[6523.46 → 6534.26] I'm very sorry about that good night i finally understand that reference yay yeah we had we
[6534.26 → 6544.50] spent about 20 minutes on that after the last live stream watching different oh man what was
[6544.50 → 6548.18] what was the name of that one where they go through and there's all the different rooms there's like the
[6548.18 → 6553.22] argument room oh the argument clinic oh my goodness if you haven't seen it Monty Python argument clinic
[6553.22 → 6557.14] yeah it's amazing freaking awesome i love it absolutely it's like the best thing ever
[6557.14 → 6561.70] that's that's actually my favourite Monty Python sketch it's really, really good
[6563.94 → 6568.18] i don't have anything else to say man not really what happened this week i don't know it's been kind
[6568.18 → 6572.18] of a busy week hasn't it i we worked on
