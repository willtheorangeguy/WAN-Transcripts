[0.00 → 7.38] well Google Hangouts on Air is just the buggiest thing I've ever seen
[7.38 → 13.44] and I really hope my default audio input device is the
[13.44 → 19.44] microphone right here and not the webcam. Oh, come on. There we go let's see if
[19.44 → 25.00] no it's still using the webcam so yeah
[25.00 → 29.94] sweet. I wonder if there's anything I can do about this right now
[29.94 → 34.50] it's at my proper microphone positioning
[34.50 → 42.18] okay yeah so basically I hadn't actually decided if I was going to do any kind of
[42.18 → 43.60] a live stream tonight or not
[43.60 → 46.94] I was just testing a new webcam one that I've got
[46.94 → 50.70] attached to the laptop so that I can more easily pick it up
[50.70 → 53.54] and show you guys what I'm working on or
[53.54 → 58.58] you know graphs of performance numbers that are in progress or whatever else the
[58.58 → 63.72] case may be and then easily put it back so that was sort of the concept of what I
[63.72 → 69.14] was trying to figure out today and
[69.14 → 74.08] okay that's apparently not gonna work and so that totally didn't work out for me
[74.08 → 79.14] because what I did is I started the Hangout on Air and then I never actually
[79.14 → 82.94] started the broadcast, so I assumed if I didn't start the broadcast that it
[82.94 → 88.08] wouldn't see I don't even have to wear this because it's using the mic on the webcam
[88.08 → 93.50] which I don't even know if it's working or not
[93.50 → 102.08] so yeah so I didn't know it was publishing to my channel because I hadn't actually broadcasted
[102.08 → 106.14] anything and then when I realized that a bunch of people were tweeting me and
[106.14 → 110.28] asking me when I was starting my hangout I was like what hangout are you guys talking about
[110.28 → 114.64] so then I was like oh okay, so I went to my YouTube channel and there it was it said
[114.64 → 118.98] on air, and it was just black, and it was just waiting to start, so I realized people
[118.98 → 122.28] have been sitting here forever waiting for this to start and nothing was ever gonna start
[122.28 → 126.80] because I didn't even know it was happening so then what I did is I closed the
[126.80 → 132.08] Google Plus Hangouts window which I thought would shut the whole thing down but it
[132.08 → 137.90] didn't it didn't work at all, so there's a lot of people okay apparently I have a call
[137.90 → 141.90] from slick right now, so I'm just going to take this because that's the whole point of this
[141.90 → 149.84] like on air thing right yes hello sir I'm not bad you are not watching this are you
[149.84 → 160.34] yeah I know I'm live-streaming you called me to tell me that I'm live-streaming when I'm
[160.34 → 163.96] sitting here on a live stream ranting about how the live stream doesn't work correctly
[163.96 → 172.24] you wanted to troll me well you have definitely achieved that just for that I'm going to I'm
[172.24 → 175.66] going to just take my phone I'm going to go like this I'm going to show them all your real name
[175.66 → 181.34] oh no you know no, no you hold on I'm going to put you on speaker I'm going to put you on speaker hold on
[181.34 → 186.82] hold on hold on okay, okay, so slick's on speaker here now guys so slick why don't
[186.82 → 193.36] you tell them um where you're going this coming weekend sorry, sorry hold on you weren't
[193.36 → 197.98] loud enough you weren't loud enough where you going where you're going okay so anyone
[197.98 → 208.90] who wants to find slick at packs where would you find him excellent and something to note is the
[208.90 → 215.44] first person who finds slick I have given him a special prize to give to that person so you should
[215.44 → 220.54] go look for slick if you're going to packs, and he has a special prize for you if you're the first
[220.54 → 225.46] person to find him that is if he's not lazy, and he does actually bother to take the prize with him
[225.46 → 229.84] okay I'm taking off speaker so uh why are you guys even tuned into this
[229.84 → 244.72] oh okay so he's water cooling is 800d and he just sort of happened to go on YouTube and find out that uh
[244.72 → 250.00] that I'm live-streaming right now I'm working on that big bang m power video right now here you guys
[250.00 → 256.00] can uh I'm going to move the camera so you guys can see what I'm talking about but uh yeah, so thanks for
[256.00 → 261.70] helping me with that by the way I realized that the uh that the release date is actually today the 28th
[261.70 → 268.06] so I'm doing some benchmarks with it actually the overclocking process on it was really easy it took
[268.06 → 276.70] about I don't know 15 minutes total to get both the uh the motherboard dialled in to 4.6 gigahertz
[276.70 → 285.02] and that uh GTX 680 lightning dialled into like a pretty actually pretty boss overclock as well so uh
[285.02 → 291.36] so overall things are going pretty well anyway I will talk to you later thank you for thanking you
[291.36 → 297.24] for calling me to inform me that I was live-streaming because I couldn't tell that okay cool bye
[297.24 → 306.40] this guy kids today that's what I say he's not even that much younger than me to be perfectly honest
[306.40 → 313.24] so I don't know I guess we might as well do a short uh someone says everyone is bored
[313.24 → 318.28] and typing random stuff in the comments I can't even see the comments I don't even know where to
[318.28 → 326.26] see the comments other than like opening up another tab and uh, and you know trying to make some sense of
[326.26 → 334.74] the epic failure that is uh that is the comments updating like 50 at a time and I know you guys are
[334.74 → 340.60] telling me that I should be using twitch TV, and you're probably right, but it's not in all
[340.60 → 347.64] likely going to happen for now just because I don't really have the uh I don't really have the follower
[347.64 → 353.26] base on their like I do on YouTube so what do you guys think of this webcam versus the one I was using
[353.26 → 363.70] last time okay now I see some comments' yay also somehow the uh yeah I know there's use stream as
[363.70 → 369.34] well but the same problem as we have with twitch TV where I don't really have the uh I don't really
[369.34 → 375.00] have the follower base there and guys if you do want to send me a comment please use Twitter um because
[375.00 → 381.66] I just it's not manageable to read the comments on the videos uh I'm on Twitter at Linus tech and
[381.66 → 393.82] cry bosh says can you say my name on the stream I'll try I tried cry bosh uh yeah so Linus tech on Twitter
[393.82 → 398.66] make sure you're following otherwise this is really not going to work, so I don't know what else
[398.66 → 402.30] to tell you guys at this point do you have any questions about the big bang m power motherboard
[402.30 → 410.60] ah what CPU cooler is that fascinating question that is actually to be quite dark rock 2
[410.60 → 418.02] or something okay, okay now the twitter is exploding uh Tyler Paddington wants a shout-out
[418.02 → 426.74] and I think the live stream just died uh slick said he's going to be in the BYOC section of pax so
[426.74 → 431.84] he's in he's going to be in the land YouTube is fine for streaming can we please see rumble and
[431.84 → 434.94] rock you know what I don't know where they are long let me go see let me go see if they're
[434.94 → 438.84] around I'll go see if I can find one of the cats I'll be back in a sec
[438.84 → 445.84] kind of
[447.78 → 449.52] yeah
[449.52 → 456.72] yeah
[456.72 → 462.50] yeah
[462.50 → 464.34] I'm man
[464.34 → 467.84] Everyone say hi to the kitty.
[467.84 → 471.78] If this is even still working. Yeah, there it goes.
[471.78 → 474.60] There's a real delay going on there. Say hi, Rumble.
[474.60 → 479.28] He's not really sure what to make of all this.
[479.28 → 485.00] He's interested in my phone buzzing over there because Twitter's going crazy.
[485.00 → 489.00] Say hi, everyone.
[489.00 → 497.00] You can dance too. See? Dancing cat.
[497.00 → 499.00] Everyone loves dancing cats on the internet.
[499.00 → 502.00] Okay, have you had enough of this? Okay, he's eating them.
[502.00 → 508.00] That was all. Okay, let's see if I can actually read any of these questions fast enough to answer them.
[508.00 → 511.00] What fans would you recommend for Corsair H80?
[511.00 → 514.00] Probably Noctua F-Series would be your best bet.
[514.00 → 517.00] What's up, Ludovic.
[517.00 → 520.00] Ludovic. Okay.
[520.00 → 526.00] And 2am McDonald's run. No, not McDonald's. I already had McDonald's today. It was terrible.
[526.00 → 529.00] To find him and win, I'll ask every person there.
[529.00 → 540.00] You know, it's not that hard because you can find a lot of pictures of him on sort of random reflections on the TV and whatnot.
[540.00 → 545.00] As for the graphics card behind me, there are quite a few graphics cards behind me in case you guys hadn't noticed.
[545.00 → 546.00] So there's, uh...
[546.00 → 549.00] Oh, there's some... Oh, there's this one.
[549.00 → 550.00] The...
[550.00 → 551.00] The...
[551.00 → 552.00] The 70...
[552.00 → 553.00] The 70-something.
[553.00 → 556.00] The 7850 Power Edition from MSI.
[556.00 → 558.00] And I've got the, uh...
[558.00 → 561.00] The 7870 Hawk Edition, which is also behind me here.
[561.00 → 562.00] Um...
[562.00 → 567.00] I've got a Sapphire 7950 with their dual fan cooler.
[567.00 → 569.00] So that's behind me.
[569.00 → 570.00] Um...
[570.00 → 573.00] I've got a Galaxy GTX 670.
[573.00 → 574.00] That's behind me.
[574.00 → 575.00] And then, uh...
[575.00 → 576.00] What else is behind me?
[576.00 → 577.00] Well, technically these are behind me.
[577.00 → 580.00] So I've got a couple 660 Tis on a test bench.
[580.00 → 581.00] Uh...
[581.00 → 586.00] One of these is actually the one that I'm going to give away on Twitter over the next little while here.
[586.00 → 587.00] So...
[587.00 → 592.00] I'm going to set up like a scavenger hunt or something so that people have to, uh...
[592.00 → 593.00] People have to, uh...
[593.00 → 598.00] People have to kind of like search through a couple different videos and then search through a couple different tweets
[598.00 → 601.00] and then find the, uh, solution to the problem.
[601.00 → 603.00] That is a question for me.
[603.00 → 604.00] Um...
[604.00 → 606.00] That is a question for me.
[606.00 → 609.00] Honestly, guys, I cannot keep up with this.
[609.00 → 610.00] Like, at all.
[610.00 → 612.00] Can NCI ship orders to Malaysia?
[612.00 → 613.00] No.
[613.00 → 618.00] If I overclock my 79708 GHz, then throw a GHz edition in Crossfire, will something...
[618.00 → 619.00] I don't know what button cut off?
[619.00 → 621.00] Yes, it'll probably be fine.
[621.00 → 623.00] What Z77 motherboard should I get?
[623.00 → 624.00] No price limit.
[624.00 → 625.00] Um...
[625.00 → 628.00] I'd probably go for the Maximus 5 formula, to be perfectly honest.
[628.00 → 630.00] The one that comes with the, uh...
[630.00 → 633.00] with that beast USB external sound card.
[633.00 → 636.00] What was my first computer?
[636.00 → 641.00] Well, my first computer was my family's computer because, uh, I didn't own my first computer.
[641.00 → 645.00] So, I guess there are two different answers to that question.
[645.00 → 647.00] The one where, uh...
[647.00 → 650.00] I say that my first computer was a 286.
[650.00 → 651.00] Um...
[651.00 → 654.00] Actually, no, because my mom had a Commodore at one point.
[654.00 → 657.00] So, I didn't really use that one, though.
[657.00 → 663.00] And then my first actual personal computer was a Pentium 166 MHz, and I used it to run Warcraft 2.
[663.00 → 664.00] Which is awesome.
[664.00 → 670.00] And yes, I will be getting Windows 8 since my job is to use all the latest stuff, figure out how it works,
[670.00 → 672.00] and then try to educate you people about it.
[672.00 → 673.00] I don't really have a choice.
[673.00 → 677.00] I always have to use the latest, even if I don't necessarily prefer it.
[677.00 → 682.00] As for one 680 versus two 660 Tis, great question.
[682.00 → 683.00] Um, check this out.
[683.00 → 685.00] I actually filmed...
[685.00 → 686.00] See?
[686.00 → 688.00] See how this is crossed out?
[688.00 → 691.00] 680 versus 660 Ti SLI?
[691.00 → 692.00] See?
[695.00 → 696.00] Well, that's done.
[696.00 → 697.00] That's filmed.
[697.00 → 698.00] That's coming soon.
[698.00 → 700.00] So, stay tuned for that.
[700.00 → 701.00] Can you have free swag?
[701.00 → 702.00] No.
[702.00 → 703.00] Am I certified?
[703.00 → 706.00] Like, for STDs?
[706.00 → 707.00] Or like...
[707.00 → 708.00] I don't know.
[708.00 → 709.00] I don't understand.
[709.00 → 711.00] I am not saving up for Ducati.
[711.00 → 713.00] I'm still really happy with the SV650S.
[713.00 → 716.00] I honestly haven't had much time to, uh...
[718.00 → 720.00] write it this year, to be perfectly honest.
[720.00 → 723.00] I'm, uh, super disappointed about that.
[723.00 → 725.00] What is your view about Mackintoshes?
[725.00 → 728.00] I've been meaning to try and get around to building one at some point,
[728.00 → 731.00] but I just have not had the time at all.
[732.00 → 734.00] Computer certifications?
[734.00 → 735.00] No, I do not have any.
[735.00 → 737.00] I am 100% self-taught.
[737.00 → 740.00] Basically, my, uh...
[742.00 → 747.00] My experience amounted to reading and spending way, way too much on this crap.
[747.00 → 751.00] And then, uh, just kind of learning about it through trial and error.
[751.00 → 754.00] Your MSI 570 has a 480 cooler.
[754.00 → 756.00] Can you return it to NCI-X?
[756.00 → 757.00] No, I'm afraid not.
[757.00 → 758.00] Is my hair wet?
[758.00 → 759.00] No.
[759.00 → 762.00] No, no, it's just that there's a light right here.
[762.00 → 765.00] So you guys are catching that reflection coming right off my head,
[765.00 → 768.00] which makes it look like my hair is either wet or extremely greasy.
[768.00 → 770.00] Uh, okay.
[770.00 → 771.00] Do I play Minecraft?
[771.00 → 773.00] No, I don't, unfortunately.
[773.00 → 776.00] With babies, there's not much time for Minecraft.
[776.00 → 777.00] Um, VGA SRX.
[777.00 → 780.00] Good question, because it's, uh...
[780.00 → 781.00] Okay, Tyler.
[781.00 → 782.00] Tyler Paddington.
[782.00 → 785.00] Stop tweeting the same thing over and over again.
[785.00 → 787.00] Because you're just, like, clogging up the feed.
[787.00 → 789.00] Like, look how quickly these are coming in.
[789.00 → 790.00] How am I supposed to read this?
[790.00 → 792.00] It's ridiculous.
[792.00 → 797.00] Then there's my cat, who's also ridiculous.
[797.00 → 798.00] He's nuzzling the foam.
[798.00 → 800.00] Because that's somehow helpful.
[800.00 → 804.00] Ah, am I going to benchmark the 7990 soon?
[804.00 → 805.00] Probably not.
[805.00 → 807.00] Um, I don't really have a way to get my hands on that one.
[807.00 → 813.00] As for 7970 versus 680, you know what?
[813.00 → 814.00] It doesn't really matter.
[814.00 → 817.00] Once you overclock them both to the max, it's pretty much the same.
[817.00 → 820.00] However, if I was going to pick a 680,
[820.00 → 823.00] I would definitely go with the Lightning Edition one that I have in here.
[823.00 → 825.00] It does overclock better than most 680s.
[825.00 → 828.00] How to get more views on YouTube?
[828.00 → 830.00] That's a very interesting question.
[830.00 → 834.00] Um, as for Windows being awful, go Linux or go home.
[834.00 → 836.00] Yeah, that's fantastic.
[836.00 → 838.00] Go run Crisis 2 on Linux and then we'll talk.
[838.00 → 840.00] Um...
[840.00 → 843.00] Okay, so getting more views on YouTube.
[843.00 → 850.00] I guess make interesting content and make it regularly.
[850.00 → 853.00] That's the best advice I can really give you.
[853.00 → 855.00] No, your H100 isn't going to leak.
[855.00 → 859.00] Maximus 5 formula versus the P8Z77V premium.
[859.00 → 863.00] I'd take the Maximus 5 just because it has that beastly onboard sound.
[863.00 → 866.00] 500R or I'd take 1100.
[866.00 → 869.00] Uh, I'd probably go 1100.
[869.00 → 870.00] Or a 300R.
[870.00 → 873.00] 300R is an outstanding case, and it's even cheaper.
[873.00 → 875.00] It's only about 70 bucks.
[875.00 → 877.00] Why don't you get ads on my videos?
[877.00 → 879.00] Well, probably because you suck, and you have ad block,
[879.00 → 881.00] which means I don't get any revenue.
[881.00 → 882.00] So there you go.
[882.00 → 884.00] Um...
[884.00 → 886.00] What do you want me to say?
[886.00 → 887.00] H80...
[887.00 → 888.00] Will I be getting...
[888.00 → 890.00] No, I probably won't be getting an iPhone 5 unless...
[890.00 → 893.00] This is my work phone, so this is an NCI issued phone.
[893.00 → 895.00] It's not like I paid for it.
[895.00 → 899.00] If they pay for an iPhone 5, then I won't happily use an iPhone 5.
[899.00 → 901.00] And I won't have any complaints.
[901.00 → 904.00] As for re-uploading video...
[904.00 → 911.00] Because I did unboxing of two different Samsung SSDs.
[911.00 → 915.00] One with an OEM package and one with a retail package.
[915.00 → 919.00] And I thought I had uploaded the one with the retail package already,
[919.00 → 921.00] but I had actually uploaded the one with the OEM package,
[921.00 → 923.00] so I re-uploaded the same one.
[923.00 → 925.00] So that was, uh...
[925.00 → 926.00] That was my bad.
[926.00 → 927.00] Updates on my personal rig.
[927.00 → 929.00] You guys really want to see an update on my personal rig?
[929.00 → 930.00] Okay, here.
[930.00 → 932.00] Camera's coming with me.
[932.00 → 934.00] I'm going to move.
[934.00 → 938.00] Okay, we're going into the side room.
[938.00 → 940.00] We're going to need a light for this.
[940.00 → 942.00] So I'm going to turn the light around.
[942.00 → 945.00] Seems a lot disturbed.
[945.00 → 947.00] That's my personal rig right there.
[947.00 → 949.00] Progress being made?
[949.00 → 951.00] Exactly zero.
[951.00 → 952.00] Zero progress.
[952.00 → 954.00] No progress at all.
[954.00 → 956.00] That is all.
[956.00 → 959.00] So no...
[959.00 → 963.00] I will let you guys know as soon as there are any updates on the personal rig,
[963.00 → 966.00] but just it hasn't been a priority right now.
[966.00 → 968.00] Lots of crazy stuff going on.
[968.00 → 969.00] Some of which I can't really talk about for now,
[969.00 → 972.00] but I will definitely talk about it more later.
[972.00 → 974.00] What SSD should you get?
[974.00 → 977.00] Well, out of Crucial Corsair and Kingston, definitely Crucial.
[977.00 → 979.00] Would be my choice.
[979.00 → 980.00] Um...
[980.00 → 981.00] There we go.
[981.00 → 983.00] M4 is a good drive.
[983.00 → 984.00] Am I happy?
[984.00 → 986.00] Yes, I am very happy.
[986.00 → 987.00] Thank you.
[987.00 → 988.00] How's the baby?
[988.00 → 990.00] The baby has a lot to do with why I'm happy.
[990.00 → 991.00] Although he's a pain in the butt.
[991.00 → 992.00] He's sleeping right now.
[992.00 → 995.00] He's actually sleeping through this, which is great.
[995.00 → 996.00] This is awesome.
[996.00 → 997.00] Interactive YouTube.
[997.00 → 999.00] You've got to know your dot, dot, dot.
[999.00 → 1001.00] And then the tweets just went ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ, ZZZ,
[1001.00 → 1002.00] and then it went away.
[1002.00 → 1003.00] So I'm...
[1003.00 → 1004.00] I'm...
[1004.00 → 1006.00] Yeah, I wasn't able to do anything.
[1006.00 → 1007.00] Um...
[1007.00 → 1009.00] I know how to snowboard.
[1009.00 → 1010.00] I know how to ski.
[1010.00 → 1012.00] I only snowboard maybe once a year or so.
[1012.00 → 1014.00] I mean, I'm so close to the mountains that it's, uh...
[1014.00 → 1016.00] There's no real excuse for it, I guess.
[1016.00 → 1018.00] But it's just hard to find the time, I guess.
[1018.00 → 1021.00] Uh, there was no coil line on the AS Rock board.
[1021.00 → 1022.00] That was sort of the point of the video.
[1022.00 → 1025.00] Um, no coil line, but it did have an annoying chipset fan.
[1025.00 → 1027.00] So that's, uh...
[1027.00 → 1030.00] That's not something that I'm going to go for.
[1030.00 → 1032.00] Can I do these more often?
[1032.00 → 1033.00] I don't know.
[1033.00 → 1035.00] I've already done three in the last, like, four days.
[1035.00 → 1038.00] So, um, it's not like I'm going to live on YouTube.
[1038.00 → 1039.00] Do I have a baby?
[1039.00 → 1041.00] Yes, I do have a baby.
[1041.00 → 1044.00] You're going to come to Canada just to meet me.
[1044.00 → 1046.00] Okay, so mbussard45.
[1046.00 → 1049.00] I'm going to go ahead and report you to the, uh...
[1049.00 → 1052.00] You know, the Mounties.
[1052.00 → 1054.00] Because that's what we have here in Canada.
[1054.00 → 1055.00] Do I like Australia?
[1055.00 → 1056.00] I've never been there.
[1056.00 → 1058.00] Although I'd love to scuba dive there.
[1058.00 → 1060.00] That would be kinda awesome.
[1060.00 → 1065.00] Uh, so for anyone who just tuned in, I guess I should probably clarify.
[1065.00 → 1069.00] Anything you write in the comments for this video, I'm not going to see it.
[1069.00 → 1072.00] Because the YouTube comments are totally useless.
[1072.00 → 1075.00] So you're gonna want to tweet any questions that you have at me.
[1075.00 → 1076.00] It's Linus Tech on Twitter.
[1076.00 → 1078.00] Although you can see how quickly the tweets are moving.
[1078.00 → 1080.00] It's pretty hard for me to keep up with them.
[1080.00 → 1082.00] There's only so much I can do.
[1082.00 → 1085.00] Why do I read tweets in the lock screen?
[1085.00 → 1086.00] Good question!
[1086.00 → 1089.00] Because if I look at them in the app manually,
[1089.00 → 1092.00] then I will have to drag it down and refresh every time.
[1092.00 → 1095.00] And I will always be way, way, way behind.
[1095.00 → 1097.00] So by the time I actually answer a question,
[1097.00 → 1100.00] people will have long since moved on to other things.
[1100.00 → 1103.00] What is my favourite value case?
[1103.00 → 1105.00] Probably 300R right now.
[1105.00 → 1108.00] Um, although if you wanna talk like a really cheap case,
[1108.00 → 1109.00] I'd say the Fractal Core 1000.
[1109.00 → 1113.00] Just because it's super, super cheap and the layout inside is very smart.
[1113.00 → 1116.00] Uh, the breed of my cat is a Bengal.
[1116.00 → 1118.00] I have two cats, Rocket and Rumble.
[1118.00 → 1119.00] They're both Bengals.
[1119.00 → 1123.00] How many monitors do I... something, something, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.
[1123.00 → 1124.00] You know what?
[1124.00 → 1125.00] I'm going to turn the phone off silent.
[1125.00 → 1129.00] So you guys can appreciate how quickly these are coming in.
[1129.00 → 1136.00] What do you think about Rev drives?
[1136.00 → 1138.00] I think they're too expensive for what they are.
[1138.00 → 1141.00] You're far better off to just run RAID on a couple of standalone SSDs.
[1141.00 → 1144.00] 550D versus R4.
[1144.00 → 1146.00] You have to be R4 for sure.
[1146.00 → 1149.00] As for Alex from MSI having your dream job.
[1149.00 → 1151.00] Um, he works really hard by the way.
[1151.00 → 1152.00] Just so you know.
[1152.00 → 1154.00] What's my view on Linux?
[1154.00 → 1156.00] It's an operating system.
[1156.00 → 1158.00] It doesn't really run games.
[1158.00 → 1160.00] So, yeah, it's not that relevant to me.
[1160.00 → 1162.00] What's there to eat in Richmond right now?
[1162.00 → 1164.00] Uh, go to Silver Tower, actually.
[1164.00 → 1167.00] It's like pretty decent Chinese food.
[1167.00 → 1172.00] And they're open like, I think 24 hours or at least very late at night.
[1172.00 → 1175.00] I often play there after badminton which is around this time.
[1175.00 → 1177.00] Or back when I was able to do that.
[1177.00 → 1178.00] Have I been to Europe?
[1178.00 → 1179.00] Yes, I have.
[1179.00 → 1185.00] I've been to, uh, I flew to Amsterdam, and then I took a train from there after one day.
[1185.00 → 1189.00] Uh, this is with my mom for my, uh, after my grad.
[1189.00 → 1191.00] And I stayed in Paris for two weeks.
[1191.00 → 1195.00] And then we, uh, then we went home.
[1195.00 → 1197.00] Minus runs left for dead.
[1197.00 → 1198.00] Used to.
[1198.00 → 1200.00] Can I give you a cat?
[1200.00 → 1201.00] No.
[1201.00 → 1202.00] Where's the NCI building?
[1202.00 → 1204.00] www.ncx.com slash contact us.
[1204.00 → 1205.00] It's kind of there.
[1205.00 → 1208.00] Uh, what's a good speed for a cat?
[1208.00 → 1209.00] NCI Europe.
[1209.00 → 1211.00] Probably not happening soon.
[1211.00 → 1214.00] Have you ever used an external DAC for a perfect sound?
[1214.00 → 1217.00] Actually, I'm using the, uh, Asus Essence One right now.
[1217.00 → 1219.00] Which is a headphone amp and an external DAC.
[1223.00 → 1225.00] When did you become interested in computers?
[1225.00 → 1226.00] How old are you?
[1226.00 → 1231.00] Well, I'm 26, and I became interested in computers when I was around 19, I guess.
[1231.00 → 1232.00] 18?
[1232.00 → 1239.00] I mean, I was interested in them before that, but I didn't really, I didn't really, sort of, really get into it until later.
[1239.00 → 1242.00] How do I manage a full-time job in a YouTube channel?
[1242.00 → 1250.00] Well, um, I think most YouTubers, other than the really, huge ones, are probably also working at a full-time job, besides their YouTube channel.
[1250.00 → 1254.00] It's not that much money, you guys, to be perfectly honest.
[1254.00 → 1262.00] Um, unless your name is, you know, Philip DeFranco or Ray William Johnson, you're not really rolling in the dough.
[1262.00 → 1267.00] Um, are hard disks safe and permanent?
[1267.00 → 1269.00] So I have tons of shows.
[1269.00 → 1271.00] Well, they're safe and permanent until they die.
[1271.00 → 1273.00] So that's what Raid is for.
[1273.00 → 1277.00] Why don't you use an 800D for my personal build?
[1277.00 → 1280.00] Because I don't like the 800D as much as I like the TJ07.
[1280.00 → 1283.00] Something about the Racer Blade.
[1283.00 → 1286.00] What graphics card would you recommend for a $1,000 build?
[1286.00 → 1291.00] You know what, I'd probably try and find a way to squeeze a 660 TI in there.
[1291.00 → 1294.00] Uh, what is your job title at NCI?
[1294.00 → 1295.00] I'm a product manager.
[1295.00 → 1296.00] I'm also a category manager.
[1296.00 → 1301.00] I also oversee our PC division, and I'm our YouTube host.
[1301.00 → 1304.00] So I have a bunch of different positions.
[1304.00 → 1305.00] Greetings from Sweden.
[1305.00 → 1307.00] Ah, say hi to Jens for me.
[1308.00 → 1311.00] No, I don't know which Jens, but I'm sure there's a Jens that you know.
[1311.00 → 1314.00] And, uh, he's in Sweden.
[1315.00 → 1317.00] I do know one Jens in Sweden.
[1317.00 → 1319.00] He works at Fractal Design.
[1319.00 → 1322.00] Are you going to come to Bosnia?
[1322.00 → 1323.00] No.
[1323.00 → 1326.00] Thanks for taking the time to do the live shows.
[1326.00 → 1327.00] You're welcome.
[1327.00 → 1329.00] I'm exhausted, actually.
[1329.00 → 1331.00] It's probably getting to be time to go to bed.
[1331.00 → 1332.00] Turn your sound off.
[1332.00 → 1333.00] Yeah, okay, I'll turn my sound off.
[1333.00 → 1335.00] I think I've proved my point at this time.
[1335.00 → 1337.00] Or at this point.
[1338.00 → 1339.00] Guild Wars 2.
[1339.00 → 1342.00] You know what, I haven't played an MMO since I played three months,
[1342.00 → 1344.00] or since I spent three months playing WoW.
[1344.00 → 1347.00] And then after three months, I was like,
[1347.00 → 1349.00] Whoa, it's been three months.
[1349.00 → 1352.00] And then that was the last time I played an MMO, so...
[1353.00 → 1356.00] Tyler, I already did a shout-out for you. Relax.
[1356.00 → 1361.00] Um, no, I don't really have any plans to visit Japan at any point in time.
[1361.00 → 1365.00] Although I'll probably be in Malaysia or Brunei at some point for my wife's family reunion.
[1365.00 → 1367.00] Can you get a job at NCI?
[1367.00 → 1373.00] You can email careers at ncix.com and find out.
[1373.00 → 1375.00] Greetings from Denmark.
[1375.00 → 1376.00] Hello Denmark.
[1376.00 → 1379.00] You have good badminton players.
[1379.00 → 1381.00] Congratulations.
[1381.00 → 1385.00] What's the best sound card out there?
[1385.00 → 1387.00] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1387.00 → 1389.00] NZXT helmet and sword.
[1389.00 → 1390.00] You know what, I still have the helmet.
[1390.00 → 1392.00] It's in my garage, but I gave the sword to the Russians.
[1392.00 → 1394.00] So he actually keeps it at work.
[1394.00 → 1396.00] No, I don't play CSGO.
[1396.00 → 1401.00] Haven't seen Avengers yet, but I did quite enjoy the Hunger Games movie.
[1401.00 → 1402.00] Hey.
[1402.00 → 1403.00] Oliver.
[1403.00 → 1407.00] It's apparently almost his birthday.
[1407.00 → 1412.00] Holy crap, this is going so fast.
[1412.00 → 1416.00] Why isn't NCI worldwide?
[1416.00 → 1422.00] Well there's a lot of shipping and insurance and logistical issues with worldwide e-tailing,
[1422.00 → 1426.76] roadside e-tailing. There's sort of a reason that NCI and a lot of the other guys don't
[1426.76 → 1433.76] already do it. So at this time, NCI only ships to Canada and the USA.
[1437.76 → 1442.24] I don't know Tiny Tom Logan personally, actually. I've never met him. He's on the East Coast
[1442.24 → 1445.52] and I'm sort of on the West Coast. We've never really crossed paths.
[1446.52 → 1447.52] Hi Sam.
[1447.52 → 1454.52] What is the time? The time right now is 1.36 in the morning.
[1456.80 → 1457.98] Samsung or Apple?
[1461.82 → 1468.74] What is your opinion on Windows 8? You know what? I haven't actually used it yet besides the consumer preview back when they did it. I did a video about it so
[1468.74 → 1472.76] that was pretty much my thoughts about it. It was on the Sitcom channel.
[1472.76 → 1475.76] Okay.
[1479.98 → 1487.28] 60 hertz versus 120 hertz. Ah, very good question. So that video is coming really soon. In fact, we shot two videos.
[1487.80 → 1494.30] So in one of them, we had one of Slick's friends who he's going to PAX with do a blind taste test to see if he could tell the difference.
[1494.30 → 1506.30] 60 hertz and 120 hertz. So those are going to be fascinating. And those are coming very, very soon.
[1506.30 → 1512.54] And Asher Sharon says, shout out. Done, sir.
[1513.30 → 1517.30] My brother's name is actually Asher, believe it or not, but it's spelled differently.
[1518.30 → 1521.30] A-S-H-E-R, not A-S-H-U-R.
[1521.30 → 1528.30] I know people are still commenting on YouTube. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't read them in time. I can't even keep up with the tweets.
[1528.30 → 1538.30] So for those of you who are watching on YouTube, Linus Tech on Twitter is pretty much the only way you're going to stand a chance of sending a message to me because, yeah.
[1539.30 → 1546.30] You know what? I have no idea how any of the bigger YouTubers could possibly do this. Like, the communication's unmanageable.
[1546.30 → 1558.30] I'd love it if there was a way for them to, like, for people to thumbs up the best comments so that I could actually sort of see which are the ones that most people care about.
[1559.30 → 1564.30] But right now is just sort of very difficult.
[1564.30 → 1571.30] So, do I like the new Batman? Haven't seen it yet. New baby. Haven't been to a movie in months.
[1573.30 → 1576.30] Yep. Sort of rough.
[1579.30 → 1584.30] Pentium 4 hyper-threading. Not sure where you're going with that.
[1585.30 → 1587.30] Honestly, the Twitter has even accelerated at this point.
[1587.30 → 1597.30] It's actually draining my battery really fast.
[1598.30 → 1602.30] What's the best chip... Actually, I've had a couple of people ask sort of something along these lines.
[1603.30 → 1605.30] What's the best chipset for gaming, or what's the best motherboard for gaming?
[1606.30 → 1613.30] The real answer is, aside from overclocking your CPU and your memory, although that doesn't really matter either,
[1613.30 → 1622.30] your motherboard is not going to have an impact on your gaming experience, unless you, for example, want a better sound card,
[1623.30 → 1626.30] and your motherboard has better on-board sound, then you might have a better experience that way.
[1627.30 → 1630.30] But in terms of sheer performance, it's not happening.
[1631.30 → 1633.30] And no, I'm not doing a shoutout for you. Quit spamming the channel.
[1634.30 → 1638.30] Inappropriate comments will be completely ignored, just so you guys are aware.
[1638.30 → 1642.30] All the tweets.
[1643.30 → 1645.30] Trade your baby for the best PC ever.
[1646.30 → 1649.30] I don't think I have to do that. I sort of have both already, so it's not necessary.
[1650.30 → 1652.30] 1080p versus 1440p.
[1653.30 → 1656.30] I think we can all agree that higher resolution is definitely better.
[1656.30 → 1668.30] I'd love to see some higher resolution 120Hz monitors that are, you know, slim and no pixel response time lag or anything like that.
[1669.30 → 1672.30] So, SPI134, yes, this is how you talk to me.
[1673.30 → 1675.30] Thank you for being new to Twitter. Good work.
[1675.30 → 1682.30] I'm using a Logitech 910 webcam.
[1683.30 → 1686.30] No warehouse sale is planned for the States.
[1687.30 → 1689.30] I haven't seen the CM Storm Striker.
[1690.30 → 1696.30] I don't know if my baby needs a computer yet.
[1697.30 → 1699.30] He's four months old, so it's sort of a non-factor to the moment.
[1699.30 → 1706.30] Yeah, I love Quake 3. I never played any of the earlier ones. I wasn't really into PC gaming at that point.
[1707.30 → 1711.30] My baby is in my personal rig update, episode 8, part 8.
[1712.30 → 1715.30] So he's definitely on YouTube already, so there you go.
[1716.30 → 1720.30] Monitor bezel videos.
[1721.30 → 1724.30] I don't think people are that interested in the bezels of monitors.
[1724.30 → 1729.30] Not sure when the next warehouse sale is. What is RAID?
[1730.30 → 1733.30] Good question, except that I do have a few videos about that already.
[1734.30 → 1736.30] In fact, I'm going to try something here. I'm going to see what happens.
[1737.30 → 1740.30] If I search for something on YouTube, like, can I do that?
[1741.30 → 1743.30] Okay, something, something.
[1744.30 → 1745.30] Add videos.
[1746.30 → 1747.30] You know what? I sort of give up on that.
[1748.30 → 1751.30] OOP, OOP, OOP. No, I can't figure out where to go back to.
[1751.30 → 1753.30] Let's go back to chat.
[1754.30 → 1755.30] Is that where we were?
[1756.30 → 1757.30] Maybe go back to camera thing.
[1760.30 → 1761.30] Hmm.
[1764.30 → 1765.30] Seems to be still working, so...
[1766.30 → 1768.30] I don't really know exactly what's going on here.
[1769.30 → 1770.30] Doesn't help that my window is small.
[1770.30 → 1771.30] Google Hangouts.
[1771.30 → 1773.30] Open that back up.
[1774.30 → 1775.30] And...
[1776.30 → 1779.30] Close the YouTube...
[1780.30 → 1781.30] Ah, there we go.
[1782.30 → 1783.30] Okay, I give up on the YouTube thing.
[1783.30 → 1785.30] But if you search for, like, what is RAID on YouTube...
[1786.30 → 1787.30] Let's try that.
[1787.30 → 1788.30] What is RAID?
[1789.30 → 1790.30] I think...
[1791.30 → 1792.30] Oh, wow, I'm not even there.
[1793.30 → 1795.30] Fine, let's try RAID explanation.
[1795.30 → 1796.30] Ha-ha! Yes!
[1797.30 → 1799.30] I am number one and number four hits for that one.
[1799.30 → 1802.30] So, go ahead and check that out if you're interested in learning about RAID.
[1803.30 → 1806.30] Surround gaming or one big monitor?
[1807.30 → 1808.30] Personally, one big monitor...
[1809.30 → 1812.30] Well, I can understand why people like surround gaming.
[1813.30 → 1814.30] It's mostly not really my thing.
[1814.30 → 1817.30] It's a really cool experience, but I find it a little bit overwhelming.
[1817.30 → 1818.30] Um...
[1818.30 → 1819.30] Let's just see if I can get this position right.
[1820.30 → 1821.30] Okay.
[1821.30 → 1822.30] Oh, the webcam was working so well for me before.
[1822.30 → 1823.30] There we go.
[1823.30 → 1824.30] Now it's unbroken.
[1825.30 → 1826.30] PLS or IPS?
[1826.30 → 1828.30] Right now Samsung's the only one with PLS monitors, and all the ones they have are outstanding.
[1829.30 → 1830.30] How long am I streaming for?
[1830.30 → 1831.30] I'm probably pretty much done.
[1832.30 → 1833.30] I'm pretty tired at this point in time.
[1834.30 → 1835.30] I'm pretty tired at this point in time.
[1836.30 → 1837.30] I'm pretty tired at this point in time.
[1838.30 → 1839.30] I'm pretty much done.
[1840.30 → 1841.30] I'm pretty much done.
[1841.30 → 1842.30] I'm pretty much done.
[1842.30 → 1843.30] I'm pretty much done.
[1843.30 → 1844.30] I'm pretty much done.
[1845.30 → 1846.30] I'm pretty much done at this point in time.
[1847.30 → 1849.30] Rocket and Rumble, please.
[1849.30 → 1850.30] I had Rumble here earlier.
[1851.30 → 1855.30] Here, I can grab one again if you guys really want.
[1856.30 → 1857.30] Come here, Boo, Boo.
[1858.30 → 1859.30] There he is.
[1860.30 → 1861.30] Where's my kitty?
[1862.30 → 1864.30] So he can sit here with us for a little bit.
[1865.30 → 1866.30] Thoughts on New Zealand?
[1866.30 → 1868.30] I don't have any thoughts on New Zealand.
[1869.30 → 1870.30] New Zealand is a non-factor for me.
[1870.30 → 1871.30] Best 120Hz monitor.
[1871.30 → 1880.30] At this point, I think my favourite has got to be the BenQ2420TX.
[1881.30 → 1883.30] It's got less...
[1884.30 → 1889.30] The pixel response times are very good.
[1890.30 → 1891.30] Because there's more to it than just the refresh rate.
[1891.30 → 1896.30] If the pixels aren't transitioning fast enough, then the refresh rate isn't going to do anything for you.
[1896.30 → 1898.30] Because you're going to have crosstalk between the images anyway.
[1899.30 → 1900.30] Worth getting a 3D monitor?
[1901.30 → 1902.30] Depends.
[1902.30 → 1903.30] Do you like 3D?
[1903.30 → 1904.30] Then it's worth it.
[1904.30 → 1906.30] If you don't like 3D, then it's not worth it.
[1906.30 → 1907.30] Uh...
[1907.30 → 1908.30] Whoa...
[1908.30 → 1909.30] Going too fast to read.
[1910.30 → 1911.30] Too fast to read.
[1912.30 → 1913.30] Too fast to read.
[1914.30 → 1915.30] Too fast to read.
[1916.30 → 1917.30] Too fast to read.
[1918.30 → 1919.30] Review more value products.
[1919.30 → 1920.30] You know what?
[1920.30 → 1921.30] No one cares.
[1921.30 → 1922.30] That's sort of a problem with value products.
[1923.30 → 1927.30] I can do as many videos as I want about Core i's and Kingston Value RAM.
[1928.30 → 1930.30] And nobody will look for it and nobody will watch it.
[1931.30 → 1934.30] So that's why that doesn't exist.
[1934.30 → 1937.30] What write speeds would you get with two crucial M4s?
[1937.30 → 1939.30] You'll have to sort of look it up.
[1939.30 → 1940.30] I'm sure it's on the internet somewhere.
[1941.30 → 1944.30] GTX 690 good for surround gaming?
[1944.30 → 1945.30] Yup.
[1945.30 → 1948.30] Although what I would probably do is I'd grab a couple 674 gigs.
[1949.30 → 1950.30] Or 660 Ti 3 gigs.
[1951.30 → 1954.30] Because the 690 is limited to 2 gigs frame buffer.
[1954.30 → 1956.30] Because it's got only 2 gigs per GPU.
[1959.30 → 1960.30] Um...
[1960.30 → 1964.30] What about Raid Max?
[1964.30 → 1965.30] What about Raid Max?
[1965.30 → 1966.30] Does it matter?
[1971.30 → 1972.30] Hmm...
[1973.30 → 1974.30] Okay.
[1974.30 → 1975.30] Who is this?
[1975.30 → 1976.30] Cosmic Panda.
[1976.30 → 1977.30] What about Raid Max?
[1977.30 → 1978.30] What about Raid Max?
[1978.30 → 1979.30] It's totally irrelevant.
[1979.30 → 1980.30] What about Raid Max?
[1980.30 → 1981.30] Yeah.
[1981.30 → 1982.30] Pining on ducky keyboards.
[1982.30 → 1983.30] They're mechanical.
[1983.30 → 1984.30] They're good.
[1984.30 → 1986.30] The only one I've ever actually seen is uh...
[1986.30 → 1988.30] Slicks and I like it.
[1989.30 → 1990.30] Uh...
[1990.30 → 1991.30] Why the Steve Jobs YouTube pic?
[1991.30 → 1992.30] Because I think it's hilarious.
[1993.30 → 1994.30] Uh...
[1994.30 → 1995.30] We took that uh...
[1995.30 → 1998.30] We took that picture when we were shooting one of the episodes of Net linked Weekly.
[1998.30 → 1999.30] And uh...
[1999.30 → 2005.30] Did you ever find a motherboard for your personal rig?
[2005.30 → 2009.30] No, but Gigabyte has some new X79 boards coming.
[2009.30 → 2012.30] So I'm hoping that one of those will uh...
[2012.30 → 2016.30] Not have Clio Line and will not have a loud fan or anything like that.
[2016.30 → 2018.30] Favourite keyboard?
[2018.30 → 2020.30] Neon ix Kabul 60 right now.
[2020.30 → 2022.30] That's the one I'm using on my personal machine over there.
[2022.30 → 2024.30] It's got an itch on my face.
[2024.30 → 2026.30] I feel self-conscious now.
[2029.30 → 2030.30] Um...
[2030.30 → 2032.30] I'm not looking forward to unboxing anything in the future.
[2032.30 → 2036.30] I have about my next two weeks worth of unboxing is already filmed and queued up.
[2037.30 → 2041.30] So I'm actually looking forward to a bit of a break from unboxing anything.
[2041.30 → 2045.30] No, I have no plans to do anything with the $79.90.
[2045.30 → 2048.30] I think they're making like 500 of them or something.
[2048.30 → 2050.30] So it's not that relevant.
[2050.30 → 2053.30] What about As rock?
[2053.30 → 2055.30] Something, something, something.
[2055.30 → 2057.30] Going so fast, going so fast.
[2057.30 → 2059.30] Ah, baby's name won't be uh...
[2059.30 → 2062.30] Won't be something that we're talking about for now.
[2062.30 → 2065.30] My favourite food is um...
[2065.30 → 2071.30] Okay, I can tell I'm tired because I can't actually think of my favourite food right now.
[2071.30 → 2077.30] I guess I'd have to say Teriyaki Chicken Burger at Red Robin.
[2077.30 → 2080.30] It's hard to beat that.
[2080.30 → 2085.30] Have I tried OS X?
[2085.30 → 2087.30] I tried and I failed.
[2089.30 → 2091.30] And I work tomorrow, yes I do.
[2092.30 → 2094.30] However, I'm going to be working from home tomorrow.
[2094.30 → 2095.30] So I at least won't have to commute.
[2097.30 → 2099.30] Yeah, my cat's a bangle.
[2099.30 → 2101.30] I've worked at NCI for about six years.
[2101.30 → 2108.30] My favourite mechanical switches are blues, but the exception being the Kabul 60.
[2108.30 → 2111.30] The blacks feel better and different on that one.
[2112.30 → 2113.30] Um...
[2113.30 → 2118.30] No, you won't see Slick.
[2118.30 → 2121.30] Well yeah, no, Slick's in the Net linked Weekly show.
[2121.30 → 2122.30] He's in uh...
[2122.30 → 2124.30] We interviewed him in one of them.
[2124.30 → 2129.30] He does wear a bag on his head, but that's about as close as we're going to get, I think.
[2131.30 → 2134.30] Uh huh.
[2134.30 → 2137.30] We're the reason I started YouTube.
[2137.30 → 2139.30] You started YouTube?
[2139.30 → 2140.30] Wow!
[2140.30 → 2142.30] That's outstanding.
[2142.30 → 2147.30] And no, I'm not doing this every day.
[2147.30 → 2153.30] The only reason I'm doing it today is that I screwed up and everyone thought I was doing it today.
[2153.30 → 2155.30] I wasn't actually planning on it.
[2155.30 → 2156.30] Um...
[2156.30 → 2162.30] As for my job title and what I do at NCI, we covered that in the episode eight of Net linked Weekly.
[2162.30 → 2164.30] I actually interview myself.
[2164.30 → 2165.30] So, uh...
[2165.30 → 2166.30] Yeah.
[2166.30 → 2167.30] Why does Slick hide?
[2167.30 → 2174.30] Well, it's unprofessional for camera people to show on the camera.
[2174.30 → 2178.30] They're supposed to avoid reflections and avoid being seen.
[2178.30 → 2179.30] Um...
[2179.30 → 2180.30] That's not uh...
[2180.30 → 2183.30] That's not abnormal.
[2183.30 → 2184.30] Um...
[2184.30 → 2185.30] NCI is cool.
[2185.30 → 2186.30] Asked for a shout-out.
[2186.30 → 2187.30] Shout out.
[2187.30 → 2188.30] So good work.
[2188.30 → 2190.30] You are shouted.
[2190.30 → 2192.30] I'm not in a store in Vancouver.
[2192.30 → 2197.30] I'm actually at our head office.
[2197.30 → 2199.30] Rumble is sleeping now.
[2199.30 → 2200.30] See?
[2200.30 → 2201.30] This is how he sleeps.
[2201.30 → 2202.30] Isn't that pathetic?
[2202.30 → 2203.30] What kind of cat is that?
[2203.30 → 2204.30] All the other cats are going to make fun of him.
[2204.30 → 2205.30] Pathetic.
[2205.30 → 2206.30] Um...
[2206.30 → 2207.30] Okay.
[2207.30 → 2208.30] I actually can't read these anymore.
[2208.30 → 2209.30] So...
[2209.30 → 2210.30] I think that's pretty much it for me.
[2210.30 → 2211.30] You know?
[2211.30 → 2212.30] I'm not doing that.
[2212.30 → 2213.30] I'm not doing that.
[2213.30 → 2214.30] You know?
[2214.30 → 2215.30] I'm going to go back.
[2215.30 → 2216.30] I'm going to go back to a camera.
[2216.30 → 2217.30] I'm going to go back to a camera.
[2217.30 → 2219.30] And then, as I know, my friend will be doing that.
[2219.30 → 2220.30] You know?
[2220.30 → 2221.30] Uh...
[2221.30 → 2222.30] I don't know.
[2222.30 → 2223.30] Uh...
[2223.30 → 2224.30] I can't do anything.
[2224.30 → 2225.30] I can't do anything.
[2225.30 → 2227.30] Well, I can't do anything.
[2227.30 → 2228.30] I can't do anything.
[2228.30 → 2229.30] I can't do anything else.
[2229.30 → 2230.30] I can't do anything.
[2230.30 → 2233.42] So I think that's pretty much it for tonight, you guys.
[2233.84 → 2241.08] Thank you for tuning in to my live stream and tweeting your questions and generally participating.
[2243.02 → 2246.82] And Rumble the cat says, goodnight, everybody.
[2247.54 → 2249.54] And it's time for him to sleep, too.
[2250.94 → 2251.26] See?
[2251.44 → 2252.48] Look how tired he is.
[2252.94 → 2254.46] That's how tired this cat is.
[2255.18 → 2255.42] See?
[2255.48 → 2256.10] Look at this cat.
[2256.36 → 2257.68] He'll just be like, whew!
[2259.06 → 2260.22] Look how tired he is.
[2260.86 → 2261.74] Just wants to snuggle.
[2262.26 → 2263.16] Just wants to sleep.
[2264.06 → 2264.66] Good night, everybody.
