[0.00 → 14.30] Welcome to the live stream guys! We've got an exciting show for you tonight in which we are going to give away, sponsored by Western Digital, four WD, Monet, and 900 routers.
[14.30 → 33.94] But the ones that we're going to be giving away are actually going to be signed by Team Digital, which I have been informed as a League of Legends team, but I'm more on the hardware side guys, so I can tell you all about how this router is going to enhance your League of Legends experience, but Slick can be the one to cover what a League of Legends is.
[34.30 → 34.92] What a League of Legends is?
[34.92 → 38.12] No, I'm just kidding, I know, I know it's not a League of Legends.
[38.12 → 46.94] So stay tuned guys, we are going to get into that, but we don't want to do it right at the beginning of the show because not everyone is tuned in right at the very beginning.
[47.10 → 53.26] I also want to make sure that we're not running that in the background, want to make sure that we're changing the name of the stream.
[53.74 → 66.98] I see Slick keeps changing to the new Twitch channel design, but that makes it, so I don't actually know how to change our stream title, so that's a bit of an issue there.
[66.98 → 76.56] It looks better though, if you're not viewing in the new stream layout, after Linus Tech in the URL, type slash new, it looks quite a bit better.
[76.72 → 79.96] The viewing area is larger actually, so yeah.
[80.74 → 85.72] So you can see our faces in all of their even more HD glory.
[86.22 → 87.40] Which is not usually a good thing.
[88.04 → 90.98] Live Tech Chat, join us now.
[91.72 → 92.16] Update.
[92.28 → 93.02] There we go.
[93.02 → 105.28] So, you know what, I'm going to do something that I haven't actually done in a while, or ever, and I'm going to give you guys an outline of the stuff that we are...
[105.28 → 105.96] Wait, hold on.
[106.76 → 108.24] Turn the volume up, it's quiet.
[108.38 → 108.52] Seriously?
[108.76 → 110.66] You didn't apply extra voltage to the mic.
[111.14 → 111.94] Oh, we have to do that?
[112.28 → 112.48] Yeah.
[112.60 → 113.14] Okay, we're good?
[113.40 → 113.58] Yeah.
[113.80 → 114.50] Alright, awesome.
[114.50 → 121.20] So, I'm going to actually tell you guys what we're going to cover on the live stream tonight.
[121.32 → 128.08] Which has been difficult in the past, because we've kind of won it a lot with the Twitter chat and all that kind of good stuff.
[128.84 → 133.54] And, of course, my favourite thing about this notebook is that the power button is right here on the side.
[133.80 → 136.70] And it's more like a phone, tablet style power button.
[136.70 → 138.40] So, when you touch it, it's just like...
[138.40 → 139.86] And then it...
[139.86 → 141.12] Laptop goes to sleep.
[141.20 → 144.34] Which is, of course, very helpful when I'm trying to tell you guys what we're going to talk about.
[144.46 → 146.20] So, we've got...
[146.20 → 149.36] We're going to have a little bit of chat about my Android experience so far.
[149.46 → 154.90] So, if you guys have been following me on Linus Tech Tips on YouTube, which presumably most of you are.
[154.96 → 157.42] Otherwise, I have no idea how you found this live stream.
[157.42 → 161.86] But, what I'm going to be talking about is my recent switch from iOS to Android.
[161.98 → 163.42] Some of the experiences I've been having.
[163.52 → 164.74] Some of the things that have been really cool.
[165.02 → 166.84] I'm going to let him gloat a little bit.
[168.12 → 168.60] Because...
[168.60 → 170.58] He said he'd never, ever do it.
[171.18 → 171.96] Multiple times.
[172.06 → 172.80] He's like, I've never gone to Android.
[172.80 → 174.12] Okay, the gloating comes later.
[174.40 → 175.24] The gloating comes later.
[175.32 → 175.82] I like gloating.
[175.94 → 176.70] The gloating...
[176.70 → 177.90] I'm scheduling the gloating now.
[177.90 → 179.96] But you have to spread it out to enjoy it fully.
[181.26 → 183.02] Like crappy food versus perfect food.
[183.10 → 185.40] With perfect food, you take your time and you enjoy it.
[185.96 → 187.40] Okay, well, we're going to talk about...
[187.42 → 190.86] The Tech Quickie channel, which is a secondary channel.
[190.96 → 192.18] Not the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[192.44 → 195.24] Where we're going to have videos that are more like...
[195.24 → 198.04] More like sponsored videos.
[198.30 → 199.24] So, people are...
[199.90 → 200.92] Turn your speakers up.
[201.18 → 203.64] I don't know what to do for these people.
[203.74 → 204.98] Because our mic is on maximum.
[205.14 → 206.54] So, it really actually couldn't be that quiet.
[206.54 → 208.34] It's at max with applied voltage.
[208.56 → 211.46] So, this is probably the loudest it's ever been on any live stream.
[212.06 → 212.26] Yeah.
[213.22 → 213.82] Uh...
[213.82 → 215.94] Okay, anyway.
[215.94 → 216.94] Um...
[216.94 → 219.64] So, we're going to talk a little bit about how that channel works.
[220.00 → 220.24] Uh...
[220.24 → 221.38] We're going to talk about...
[221.38 → 221.56] Uh...
[221.56 → 222.98] Everyone's stealing our idea.
[223.20 → 225.74] Where you buy things, and it comes with like a free pizza.
[226.22 → 226.52] Uh...
[226.52 → 230.64] Because apparently Google is trying to do same-day delivery.
[231.22 → 231.80] Um...
[231.80 → 233.76] To compete with guys like Amazon.
[233.76 → 235.90] Who are trying to do the same thing in certain markets.
[235.90 → 240.02] They avoided us being able to sue them for billions of dollars though.
[240.34 → 242.12] By making it not like...
[242.12 → 243.78] When you buy a product, you get something.
[243.90 → 244.14] Yeah.
[244.34 → 246.16] But they did make it so you can get food to your house.
[246.20 → 246.42] Yeah.
[246.68 → 247.12] So...
[247.12 → 249.10] So we're pretty miffed about that.
[249.54 → 253.28] AMD has showcased the 7990 reference design.
[253.28 → 256.70] So there's been a power colour like double 13 version.
[256.70 → 257.70] Uh...
[257.70 → 259.42] But other than that.
[259.92 → 260.70] It's been...
[261.74 → 262.34] Uh...
[262.34 → 262.80] It's...
[262.80 → 263.34] It's not...
[263.34 → 266.06] There hasn't been an actual AMD reference card.
[266.22 → 266.86] So that's coming.
[267.24 → 267.98] Which is exciting.
[268.36 → 270.84] Windows Blue has been leaked and showcased.
[271.26 → 271.42] Uh...
[271.42 → 273.64] So there are some videos showing some of the new functionality.
[273.94 → 274.48] So that's...
[274.48 → 275.18] That's a good one.
[275.60 → 275.80] Uh...
[275.80 → 276.46] Was there...
[276.46 → 276.96] Ah yes.
[277.06 → 280.18] Was there any doubt that streaming games online is coming?
[280.32 → 280.70] Speaking of...
[280.70 → 284.02] Sort of routers and enhancing your online gaming experience.
[284.60 → 285.60] Um...
[285.60 → 287.10] AMD has released...
[287.10 → 287.36] Uh...
[287.36 → 290.28] Details about their Sky graphics card solutions.
[290.28 → 292.26] That are going to be computed level cards.
[292.40 → 294.52] To compete with something like NVIDIA's grid technology.
[294.76 → 296.36] Where all the computing is done somewhere else.
[296.42 → 298.64] And you just stream the game experience to yourself.
[299.18 → 303.66] Activision is showing off a prototype facial expression rendering thing.
[303.82 → 304.14] For...
[304.14 → 305.52] For one of their upcoming engines.
[305.66 → 309.10] They're giving us like a really futuristic look into their lab.
[309.24 → 310.36] And did you check out that video?
[310.36 → 310.72] Yeah.
[311.40 → 312.14] UN-freaking-believable.
[312.30 → 312.44] Yeah.
[312.70 → 313.84] Like it's still eerie.
[314.18 → 317.44] But the fact that it's being done in real time is extremely exciting.
[317.52 → 319.92] Something I found that was pretty funny was all the people that were like,
[320.00 → 320.60] Oh my god!
[320.64 → 321.84] Why doesn't it have a fan?
[323.36 → 323.68] What?
[324.08 → 325.14] The sky...
[325.14 → 326.62] Oh, that's not what we're talking about anymore.
[326.88 → 327.12] Oh.
[327.50 → 328.24] I was...
[328.24 → 328.90] Focused on this.
[329.92 → 330.58] That was like...
[330.58 → 332.68] I'm trying to work with people and figure out the audio problem.
[333.32 → 333.56] I...
[333.56 → 334.40] I actually...
[334.40 → 334.56] Okay.
[334.64 → 335.04] You know what?
[335.12 → 335.26] Here.
[335.36 → 335.52] Fine.
[335.60 → 335.72] Here.
[335.98 → 339.26] Tell them what the other three things are going to be while I lower the mic.
[339.26 → 341.40] Why isn't electronics...
[341.40 → 343.04] Why aren't electronics worth anything?
[343.60 → 348.58] So he brought up that Micron lost money last year and Red Bull made an insane amount of
[348.58 → 348.76] money.
[349.12 → 353.82] And he finds it interesting that Apple's net profits are about 25% but everyone rages at
[353.82 → 354.88] them for making so much money.
[355.04 → 358.98] While other companies selling sugar water are making way more...
[358.98 → 360.66] Like way larger margins than that.
[360.74 → 362.08] Are sponsoring F1...
[362.08 → 362.44] Oh, whoops.
[362.52 → 363.32] I'm probably a little close.
[363.56 → 364.40] They sponsor everything.
[364.56 → 369.80] They sponsor F1 teams and sort of everything that they want and...
[369.80 → 371.64] Yeah.
[372.20 → 374.48] And apparently no one's upset about this.
[374.84 → 380.06] Like they have the marketing budget of the entire PC industry combined as far as I can tell.
[380.06 → 381.16] But that's kind of...
[381.16 → 383.38] They will sponsor anything.
[383.56 → 384.62] Like they sponsor lands.
[384.72 → 386.08] They sponsor everything.
[386.24 → 388.58] And there's no way they are actually gaining from that.
[388.80 → 391.36] So I think people are happy with what Red Bull does with their money.
[391.78 → 394.30] While Apple does absolutely nothing.
[395.10 → 397.82] They're just like, yeah, we'll make cooler commercials, so more people buy our stuff.
[398.28 → 399.34] Red Bull does that too.
[399.86 → 404.34] Yes, but Red Bull also sponsors stuff like jumping from almost base and flying all the
[404.34 → 404.56] way down.
[404.66 → 405.30] Which is pretty cool.
[406.26 → 407.46] Um, okay.
[407.46 → 409.74] Like they make really cool events.
[409.86 → 411.40] And I want to talk about this at the end.
[411.50 → 413.40] This is more of an after party topic.
[414.02 → 420.22] Um, obviously we're going to do some discussion about Fast Track and Fast Track Plus, which is
[420.22 → 423.46] WD's technology for making the...
[423.46 → 425.46] Uh...
[437.46 → 455.96] ...
[455.98 → 456.28] ...
[467.46 → 476.76] Alright, so I blame Slick for that entirely. That was obviously his fault.
[476.76 → 479.96] He was setting up the camera, the camera's not plugged into the mic. I was setting up the mic,
[479.96 → 482.28] the other end of the cable is not plugged in there.
[482.28 → 489.78] Alright, so hopefully that sounds great and you guys are enjoying the audio now.
[489.78 → 496.26] Okay, so we're going to do all of our discussion about Fast Track Plus, which is WD's network
[496.26 → 499.86] prioritization functionality in their routers, and then we're going to give away
[499.86 → 503.98] those four routers. We're gonna talk about stuttering in games and how that
[503.98 → 512.22] relates to frames per second, which is not the same thing at all, and actually we're
[512.22 → 517.26] going to have a special guest on the live stream next week. Ryan Shout from PC Per,
[517.26 → 522.00] PC Perspective, is actually going to be joining us. He has an outstanding article
[522.00 → 529.60] about micro stuttering and stuttering in general on graphics cards, and how you can detect it, how you can avoid it,
[529.60 → 537.60] and how graphics card benchmarking is gonna change completely in the next sort of year or two here.
[537.60 → 538.60] It's just gonna...
[538.60 → 542.60] Get a lot more science-y. Right now it's just kind of general observation.
[542.60 → 546.20] Yes. And this will come down to like actual...
[546.20 → 550.20] Like what we get from the experience performance benchmarks.
[550.20 → 554.20] What hits the eyes of the gamers who are actually playing the games, which is...
[554.20 → 562.20] Which is pretty, uh, pretty crazy. Apparently there's no video on YouTube about the live stream, so we can go see if that actually...
[562.20 → 565.20] Sometimes YouTube delays publishing, so it looks like...
[565.20 → 570.80] Yeah, it's still publishing that to subscribers' feeds, so hopefully that'll be out soon.
[570.80 → 572.80] So, there you go, guys.
[572.80 → 577.80] Alright, so let's get into our first topic, which is going to be...
[579.80 → 581.80] Anticlimactic.
[581.80 → 585.80] Yeah, it feels like I've covered all the topics now, so why don't we do some Twitter Q&A?
[585.80 → 586.80] Okay.
[586.80 → 588.80] Where's my keyboard?
[588.80 → 589.80] Alright.
[589.80 → 593.40] So, let's see if I can remember my, uh, my keywords here.
[593.40 → 595.40] There we go, Twitter.
[595.40 → 596.40] Oh, look at that.
[596.40 → 602.40] The first thing we see is Western Digital tweeting about how we're going to be giving away some sweet routers on our live stream tonight.
[602.40 → 604.40] So, there's some...
[604.40 → 605.40] Oh, and...
[605.40 → 606.40] And Team Digital.
[606.40 → 613.40] And, yes, Team Digital is also, uh, saying that you can watch live, and you can have a chance to win a router.
[613.40 → 616.40] How many followers do they have on Twitter, I wonder?
[616.40 → 617.40] There you go.
[617.40 → 619.00] 31,000 followers.
[619.00 → 620.00] That's awesome.
[622.40 → 623.80] Wow, they're very active, too.
[623.80 → 624.40] Look at that.
[624.40 → 625.40] 12,500 tweets.
[625.40 → 634.60] You can tell the difference between, like, celebrities who have a Twitter account and actually have, like, someone tweeting for them.
[634.60 → 638.00] Like, you can look at a couple tweets, and you can look at how many tweets they actually send out.
[638.00 → 647.00] Uh, and you can tell people who are just like, follow me, and I'll follow you, whores, because they'll be following, like, a bazillion people and then a bazillion and six people will be following them.
[647.00 → 651.60] But, uh, wow, it looks like they're really dialled into their community there.
[651.60 → 652.60] That's cool.
[652.60 → 653.60] That's cool.
[653.60 → 654.60] That's very cool.
[654.60 → 658.60] What is the major difference between PA and PB on ASUS monitors?
[658.60 → 665.60] PA is Proact, which is pre-calibrated, and PB is basically the same monitor but without pre-calibration.
[665.60 → 668.20] And there's ever so slightly, uh, different feature sets.
[668.20 → 669.20] Yes.
[669.20 → 675.20] So Proacts have things like the, uh, the grid alignments for, for graphic design and stuff like that you can overlay.
[675.20 → 686.20] Common PC building mistakes, uh, forgetting to plug in your graphics card power, um, screwing up and not quite plugging in entirely, like, a motherboard power connector, because sometimes they can be at a bit of a weird angle.
[686.20 → 687.20] RAM slots.
[687.20 → 689.80] Forgetting to put thermal compound on things.
[689.80 → 690.80] Ooh.
[690.80 → 691.80] Yeah, that's a bad thing.
[691.80 → 692.80] That's not fun.
[692.80 → 693.80] Um, whoops.
[693.80 → 694.80] Where'd you go?
[694.80 → 696.80] I, I, I fell.
[696.80 → 699.80] Um, I want to be the same height as you on the live stream.
[699.80 → 700.80] Alright.
[700.80 → 701.80] Because I like to keep up appearances.
[701.80 → 706.80] He sits very straight, and his chair is very high, and then I sit farther away from the camera, lean over, and my chair's low.
[706.80 → 709.80] He actually is farther away from the camera, so.
[709.80 → 715.40] Yeah, it makes my little man complex, uh, feel a lot better.
[715.40 → 717.80] Does Canada not do daylight savings time?
[717.80 → 718.80] Uh, yes we do.
[718.80 → 720.40] But it's over.
[720.40 → 723.40] So that's why we're back to standard time.
[723.40 → 726.00] Uh, yes, Taylor, you're correct.
[726.00 → 732.40] The audio was going through the camera and not the boom mic, because, quite frankly, you guys, I mean, I know there's always an excuse.
[732.40 → 735.40] Although, you know what, we haven't had technical difficulties the last couple of weeks, I think.
[735.40 → 736.40] Two, I think.
[736.40 → 736.80] Two weeks.
[736.80 → 737.80] Last two weeks in a row.
[737.80 → 742.80] So, this week, technically it's Good Friday, which is technically a statutory holiday.
[742.80 → 748.40] And, technically, I came back from a family event that I was, like, actually supposed to be at.
[748.40 → 750.40] And, uh, came back to do the live stream.
[750.40 → 754.40] I have no idea why you're here doing this, but good work, because I'm not paying you.
[754.40 → 755.40] Alright.
[755.40 → 757.40] Uh, so yeah.
[757.40 → 758.40] So, yeah.
[758.40 → 762.80] We're going on holiday, and instead of getting, like, bonus paperwork on a holiday, you just get nothing.
[762.80 → 765.80] You're technically a manager, so I actually don't have to.
[765.80 → 771.80] I actually, you know what, Costco requires managers to work every stat holiday.
[771.80 → 772.80] Yeah.
[772.80 → 773.80] Yeah.
[773.80 → 784.80] Because managers are the only salary employees in the company, and so they don't have to pay them time and a half, because managerial employees, you don't have to pay overtime to.
[784.80 → 786.80] So that's why they do it.
[786.80 → 797.80] So they, so every single manager in Costco, if you ever want to talk to a manager at Costco, go on a stat holiday, because there's someone in every single department who's the manager of that department, guaranteed.
[797.80 → 798.80] 100%.
[798.80 → 799.80] That's an interesting tip for you.
[799.80 → 800.80] That's an interesting tip of the day.
[800.80 → 801.80] There's a tech tip for you.
[801.80 → 802.80] Yeah.
[802.80 → 803.80] Yeah.
[803.80 → 804.80] Go to Costco at holidays.
[804.80 → 805.80] That's right.
[805.80 → 807.80] It's a company-wide policy, so do go there.
[807.80 → 808.80] Do check that out.
[808.80 → 810.80] Apparently, prairies don't do daylight saving time.
[810.80 → 811.80] The prairies don't do daylight saving time?
[811.80 → 813.80] Wow, they are so backwards in every possible way.
[813.80 → 815.80] No, I'm just kidding you guys.
[815.80 → 816.80] I love you guys.
[816.80 → 817.80] I drove across the prairies once.
[817.80 → 819.80] I can't remember it, because there's nothing notable.
[819.80 → 820.80] Yes.
[820.80 → 821.80] You know what?
[821.80 → 824.80] It wasn't that bad.
[824.80 → 835.80] People talk about how flat it is, and as like a BC boy, like I grew up here in British Columbia, in Vancouver, I was expecting to be just blown away by how flat it is.
[835.80 → 840.80] Oh, Linus, you'll be able to see as far as the-you know, it's not that flat.
[840.80 → 850.80] Like, having actually-having had the privilege in my life to stand on an ocean shore, I know what flat looks like, and the prairies didn't look like the ocean, I'll tell you that much.
[850.80 → 852.80] They don't have the cool breeze of the ocean.
[852.80 → 854.80] They don't have an ocean at all.
[854.80 → 856.80] Oh, I'm just piling it on here, alright.
[856.80 → 858.80] I used to go to Edmonton for hockey trips with my hockey team.
[858.80 → 860.80] I'm sorry to hear that's not really prairies either, though, that's like-
[860.80 → 863.80] No, I know, but on the way and a little bit past is-
[863.80 → 864.80] Yeah.
[864.80 → 865.80] Yeah.
[865.80 → 866.80] Yeah.
[866.80 → 869.80] But then I also would drive past that for family trips and stuff, and I've been across it a few times.
[869.80 → 871.80] I slept for most of it.
[871.80 → 872.80] Well, yeah.
[872.80 → 873.80] Or played hockey, but like-
[873.80 → 874.80] You know what?
[874.80 → 879.80] Part of it might have been that I was so super stoked on getting my driver's license that I just didn't care.
[879.80 → 887.80] Because that was the- I got my driver's license, and my mom's hilarious because she's like, okay, that's it, you're a driver now.
[887.80 → 893.80] And all of a sudden I'm driving home from the licensing office, driving standard, never driven a car.
[893.80 → 895.80] And I'm like, okay, we're in-
[895.80 → 901.80] I know Maple Ridge isn't exactly like a metropolis, but we're in downtown-we're in the core of Maple Ridge.
[901.80 → 903.80] And she's like, okay, drive home.
[903.80 → 908.80] I'm starting on a hill, coming out of an underground parking lot with no visibility.
[908.80 → 911.80] I'm like, ma, this makes no sense.
[911.80 → 913.80] Why are we doing this?
[913.80 → 914.80] Why are you doing this to me?
[914.80 → 918.80] So then, that night, we pack up and drive across the country.
[918.80 → 921.80] So I drove to Halifax and back.
[921.80 → 922.80] Holy crap.
[922.80 → 923.80] Actually, we went all the way to Charlottetown.
[923.80 → 925.80] That's a good way to learn how to drive.
[925.80 → 926.80] I learned to drive.
[926.80 → 930.80] I learned to drive, and we went all the way across the country and back in something like 12 days or 11 days.
[930.80 → 933.80] You know what they should do for driver's ed courses?
[933.80 → 935.80] It should just be like, you know what?
[935.80 → 937.80] Take a few days off work.
[937.80 → 939.80] We're going all the way across and all the way back.
[939.80 → 941.80] That would be amazing.
[941.80 → 943.80] You learn like everything you need to know.
[943.80 → 947.80] And like as you go over, make the driver person go through city centres.
[947.80 → 948.80] Right.
[948.80 → 949.80] Oh, that's what we did.
[949.80 → 951.80] She made me drive in Montreal.
[951.80 → 952.80] Yeah.
[952.80 → 953.80] Like, do it.
[953.80 → 954.80] They're crazy.
[954.80 → 955.80] I know.
[955.80 → 956.80] Make them do it though.
[956.80 → 957.80] They're crazy.
[957.80 → 958.80] That would be like the best drivers ed ever.
[958.80 → 959.80] Like Montreal drivers, man.
[959.80 → 960.80] Let me tell you.
[960.80 → 963.80] You know how LA drivers have like a terrible reputation?
[963.80 → 964.80] Yeah.
[964.80 → 965.80] They got nothing on Montreal drivers.
[965.80 → 966.80] Nothing.
[966.80 → 975.80] I was coming into the city, and I was, like by then I'd been driving for, I had three days driving experience under my belt.
[975.80 → 976.80] So I was a pro, right?
[976.80 → 980.80] So I was going like, eh, 15, 20 K over the speed limit.
[980.80 → 981.80] And it's like a 90 road.
[981.80 → 983.80] So I'm going like 110 kilometres an hour.
[983.80 → 986.80] So it's about 65, 70 miles an hour for you American folks.
[986.80 → 990.80] Um, and I'm, I'm like, I'm worried.
[990.80 → 993.80] And my mom's like, okay, keep up with the flow of traffic.
[993.80 → 994.80] Keep up with the flow.
[994.80 → 995.80] Everyone's blowing past me.
[995.80 → 997.80] I'm already going over the speed limit.
[997.80 → 1000.80] So I'm over in the very far right lane, the slowest lane.
[1000.80 → 1005.80] And I'm like sitting there all worried because I'm like speeding and like, I'm not sure what to do.
[1005.80 → 1006.80] You have to keep up with it though.
[1006.80 → 1007.80] But people are going so fast.
[1007.80 → 1010.80] And then all of a sudden this cop blows past me.
[1010.80 → 1015.80] Must have been doing like 30, 40 kilometres an hour faster than me.
[1015.80 → 1018.80] So for our American viewers about 25 miles an hour faster than me, he was going.
[1018.80 → 1020.80] And the guy, he doesn't have his lights on.
[1020.80 → 1022.80] Doesn't have his siren on.
[1022.80 → 1027.80] He's just a French cop drinking a coffee behind his wheel cruising to work.
[1027.80 → 1030.80] And I'm like, okay, apparently it's just all right here.
[1030.80 → 1032.80] So off we go.
[1032.80 → 1036.80] So I hit the I hit the pedal, and we kept up with the flow of traffic.
[1036.80 → 1037.80] You know what they should do?
[1037.80 → 1038.80] Okay.
[1038.80 → 1042.80] I'm going to like advance on my theory from before where they should have drivers that do that.
[1042.80 → 1043.80] Yes.
[1043.80 → 1047.80] Everyone do that for one week in grade 12, and it can just be known as like hell week.
[1047.80 → 1048.80] That should be a credit.
[1048.80 → 1049.80] Yeah.
[1049.80 → 1051.80] Like learning to drive should actually be like valid.
[1051.80 → 1052.80] You know what?
[1052.80 → 1053.80] I think it is.
[1053.80 → 1055.80] No, I did get credits for my driver's ed, actually.
[1055.80 → 1056.80] So.
[1056.80 → 1057.80] Really?
[1057.80 → 1058.80] Bad suggestion.
[1058.80 → 1059.80] Okay.
[1059.80 → 1060.80] But it should be in school.
[1060.80 → 1061.80] They should make everyone for one week go across and back.
[1061.80 → 1064.80] And that would just be like the most hellish, ridiculous week everywhere.
[1064.80 → 1066.80] And all the other people would just walk to work.
[1066.80 → 1072.80] But it can be like the one week when everyone's like, okay, now everyone that is learning how to drive knows how to drive.
[1072.80 → 1073.80] That would be very cool.
[1073.80 → 1074.80] That would be cost prohibitive.
[1074.80 → 1075.80] They'd have to get cars for everyone.
[1075.80 → 1079.80] My school barely had money for construction paper for everyone by the time I was done with
[1079.80 → 1080.80] elementary school.
[1080.80 → 1081.80] That's a good point.
[1081.80 → 1082.80] Yeah, we had some problems with that too.
[1082.80 → 1083.80] No, seriously.
[1083.80 → 1096.80] When I was in about grade 10 of high school, they went from using white paper for like photocopies and handouts to using that brown paper that's like thin enough that you could decapitate a man.
[1096.80 → 1097.80] Throw it hard.
[1097.80 → 1099.80] It was like sharp paper cuts and stuff.
[1099.80 → 1101.80] Yeah, no, it was incredible.
[1101.80 → 1105.80] I remember my teachers used to ask us like if we were doing art projects.
[1105.80 → 1111.80] I remember she used to ask me and like a few of my friends that were, I noticed later on, the athletic kids who sucked at art.
[1111.80 → 1116.80] I love to use less of like the coloured paper.
[1116.80 → 1119.80] I didn't figure it out until I got into like kind of high school and stuff.
[1119.80 → 1120.80] That's because you're special.
[1120.80 → 1124.80] Well, the teachers would bring up like, yeah, okay, this stuff actually costs a lot.
[1124.80 → 1126.80] And I'd be like...
[1126.80 → 1127.80] Ohhhh.
[1127.80 → 1128.80] She'd want me to use it because I sucked.
[1128.80 → 1129.80] Okay.
[1129.80 → 1131.80] That makes so much more sense.
[1131.80 → 1132.80] I'm going nowhere in art.
[1132.80 → 1133.80] She knows this.
[1133.80 → 1134.80] I know this.
[1134.80 → 1143.74] a big problem. Oh, wow okay so let's let's do a little bit of Twitter talk here.
[1143.74 → 1146.44] Should I keep the cloth that came between my keyboard and screen with my
[1146.44 → 1151.00] laptop? You know what good idea. Yeah, whenever you close it just put it
[1151.00 → 1155.32] because on Slick's keyboard right here I can see marks from his key
[1155.32 → 1159.58] from here right here. From his keys touching the screen itself. It's
[1159.58 → 1163.24] been more obvious than this before too. Yeah, and have you looked at my MSI? Yeah
[1163.24 → 1166.84] you can totally tell you can see the individual squares. It has edge keys. Really
[1166.84 → 1170.74] good idea guys when you get a laptop either get something that goes with it
[1170.74 → 1174.16] or keep the one that came with it. Put that between the screen and the keyboard
[1174.16 → 1177.46] because it will scratch your screen. With glass screens it's less of an issue
[1177.46 → 1181.94] because you know whatever crap I could coefficient of heart whatever the
[1181.94 → 1188.62] hardness rating is. Yeah. It starts with a T or something. I'm not going to remember. Can't remember for the life of me but Moe
[1188.62 → 1199.54] Moe's hardness scale. Yeah. Yeah. So in theory a keyboard key cannot scratch a glass screen, but plastic could scratch against plastic so if you have a plastic screen cover that's an issue.
[1199.54 → 1205.02] Apparently our Twitch chat moderators are Nazis. Sorry to hear that. They are the same
[1205.02 → 1211.62] moderators as our forum. Some of them are. Some of them are, apparently. There's about equal. Slicks in charge. So direct all complaints to
[1211.62 → 1220.62] Do it. If you have problems. At Slick PC on Twitter if you have some kind of moderation issue, and he will personally take care of it within five minutes.
[1220.62 → 1221.62] Um that...
[1221.62 → 1231.62] For one I never check the messages there so that might be a problem. Contact me on the forum. That's the best way. Contact me on either Twitter or the forum if you're having any problems with moderation.
[1231.62 → 1237.62] Don't contact me on the forum because Slick broke my private message inbox so we're... I didn't break it. Well it doesn't work. I just don't know how to fix it.
[1237.62 → 1251.62] Uh Acer monitor video is cut off half... actually it's not halfway. It is at the end. The only thing that's missing is the outro. So it is a glass screen on the monitor. The only thing that was missing was thank you for watching blah blah blah. We had a little clip at the end that I can't find the footage for so...
[1251.62 → 1253.62] Uh...
[1253.62 → 1255.62] Minus text of streams. Yes I do!
[1255.62 → 1258.62] What's with the white play-doh behind me?
[1258.62 → 1261.62] You know what? Funny story, actually. Great question.
[1261.62 → 1263.62] We were using that for um...
[1263.62 → 1268.62] When you're doing sort of product glamour shots up close.
[1268.62 → 1270.62] It's nice to be able to...
[1270.62 → 1273.62] To have like a white background.
[1273.62 → 1277.62] But you don't always want to just lay the product flat on a table.
[1277.62 → 1279.62] So what I did...
[1279.62 → 1282.62] Was I took this um...
[1282.62 → 1284.62] I took this lazy Susan here.
[1284.62 → 1288.62] For those of you who don't know what a lazy Susan is. It's one of those tables that turns on its own.
[1288.62 → 1290.62] There you go. You turn it around like that.
[1290.62 → 1291.62] You can't see it spinning but trust me it is.
[1291.62 → 1296.62] And then I used play-doh to build up a thing that I could prop the thing on.
[1296.62 → 1297.62] And then I could spin it.
[1297.62 → 1302.62] And if we blew out the whites enough in post, you actually couldn't see the play-doh or this.
[1302.62 → 1304.62] It just looked like the product was spinning in the air.
[1304.62 → 1306.62] You couldn't tell that there's a terrible paint job.
[1306.62 → 1308.62] Yeah, you couldn't tell that...
[1308.62 → 1310.62] Well, you know what? That's actually not entirely my fault.
[1310.62 → 1314.62] There were adverse weather conditions that affected my ability to paint correctly.
[1314.62 → 1317.62] That's like blaming the map.
[1317.62 → 1319.62] Well, often it is the map's fault.
[1319.62 → 1325.62] I mean, maybe if like we hadn't lost the coin toss and them being able to choose the map or...
[1325.62 → 1327.62] Will you get the 4K monitor?
[1327.62 → 1329.62] I actually tweeted about this today.
[1329.62 → 1332.62] I am... I don't know if I've told you this yet.
[1332.62 → 1335.62] I am seriously considering selling my motorbike.
[1335.62 → 1336.62] Oh, so awesome.
[1336.62 → 1340.62] Because... you know how Twitter has the 140-character limit, right?
[1340.62 → 1343.62] So I tweeted, should I sell my bike and get a 4K monitor?
[1343.62 → 1346.62] You wouldn't believe how many people thought I was talking about a bicycle.
[1346.62 → 1347.62] No.
[1347.62 → 1351.62] And they were like, a 4K monitor costs like a million times more than a bike.
[1351.62 → 1355.62] So why are you even considering that? No, no, no, no. A motorcycle.
[1355.62 → 1358.62] My motorcycle is probably worth about 3 grand if I sell it.
[1358.62 → 1360.62] There are pedal bikes that are worth more than that motorcycle.
[1360.62 → 1361.62] That is true.
[1361.62 → 1364.62] But I think that's not what they assumed that I owned.
[1364.62 → 1365.62] Yeah.
[1365.62 → 1367.62] Do I look like an extreme Boxer?
[1367.62 → 1371.62] Uh... it's not usually BMX bikes.
[1371.62 → 1372.62] Maybe I'm wrong.
[1372.62 → 1374.62] Okay, not BMX. No, it can be.
[1374.62 → 1375.62] I'm sure it can be, yeah.
[1375.62 → 1376.62] Yeah, it can be.
[1376.62 → 1377.62] Um...
[1377.62 → 1382.62] But some bikes, like BMX, road bike, mountain bikes, whatever, stunt bikes, they can all get insanely expensive.
[1382.62 → 1383.62] Yes, that's true.
[1383.62 → 1393.62] So my bike is actually a not particularly expensive motorbike, but there's a 4K monitor available now from Sharp that's a 32 inch, um, and it's around $5,500 bucks.
[1393.62 → 1397.62] And I have found a place that has stock in Canada.
[1397.62 → 1398.62] What?
[1398.62 → 1399.62] So they're like ready to rock.
[1399.62 → 1400.62] In Canada.
[1400.62 → 1402.62] They're ready to sell this to me.
[1402.62 → 1403.62] That's crazy.
[1403.62 → 1406.62] So I'm, uh, I'm considering moving the bike and...
[1406.62 → 1407.62] That's interesting.
[1407.62 → 1408.62] I have no time to ride anymore.
[1408.62 → 1409.62] No, I know.
[1409.62 → 1410.62] I know.
[1410.62 → 1417.62] I was riding to work every day, but I no longer work out of the NCI office, so, um, I don't go, I don't commute anywhere.
[1417.62 → 1425.62] And that was part of the justification for getting the bike in the first place, was I was going to save money on insurance and gas six months out of the year when I didn't insure my car.
[1425.62 → 1430.62] And I'm not insuring my car any more anyway, because I don't need it, I don't go anywhere.
[1430.62 → 1432.62] And then when I go somewhere on the weekend, I have the baby.
[1432.62 → 1433.62] What am I going to do?
[1433.62 → 1434.62] Strap a baby to a motorcycle?
[1434.62 → 1438.62] You could be that guy that everyone takes a picture about and puts online.
[1438.62 → 1439.62] Yeah, that guy with like...
[1439.62 → 1440.62] Look at this idiot!
[1440.62 → 1442.62] With a baby in a sidecar.
[1442.62 → 1446.62] Like a, like a stroller, like, attached by a rope to the back of the like...
[1446.62 → 1448.62] Go around a corner, just...
[1448.62 → 1449.62] Yeah, just like drifting baby.
[1449.62 → 1450.62] Drifting a baby behind you, yeah.
[1450.62 → 1451.62] Yeah, not cool.
[1451.62 → 1452.62] That could be...
[1452.62 → 1453.62] I mean cool, but...
[1453.62 → 1454.62] That could be a movie.
[1454.62 → 1455.62] I know.
[1455.62 → 1458.62] Like, get, uh, get the rock to be the guy that drives the motorcycle thing.
[1458.62 → 1459.62] Holy crap.
[1459.62 → 1460.62] Drifting baby.
[1460.62 → 1463.62] And we could get like Hulk Hogan to be like the grandpa of the baby.
[1463.62 → 1464.62] Of course.
[1464.62 → 1465.62] That's perfect.
[1465.62 → 1466.62] Who also drifts with the baby.
[1466.62 → 1467.62] 100%.
[1467.62 → 1469.62] The grandpa is like the guy who taught everyone.
[1469.62 → 1471.62] He's the original drifting baby.
[1471.62 → 1472.62] The original drifter.
[1472.62 → 1475.62] And then, okay, no, he's actually the hero of the movie.
[1475.62 → 1476.62] He's actually the star.
[1476.62 → 1477.62] Yeah.
[1477.62 → 1482.62] Because it's, uh, it's when his son sort of, you know, picks up the family mantle and starts
[1482.62 → 1484.62] getting all the attention.
[1484.62 → 1488.62] And then he has to like to get back into the game, and he's been out of it for so long and
[1488.62 → 1492.62] like, like the, the grandpa of the other drifting baby is like talking smack about him.
[1492.62 → 1495.62] He's like the hardcore one and all that kind of stuff.
[1495.62 → 1496.62] Yeah.
[1496.62 → 1499.62] And then our drifting baby grandpa is like the good guy.
[1499.62 → 1501.62] And he wears like a pink, uh, muscle shirt.
[1501.62 → 1502.62] Yeah.
[1502.62 → 1503.62] Hollywood.
[1503.62 → 1504.62] Hollywood.
[1504.62 → 1509.62] If anyone from Hollywood is watching, um, for, for the low, low price of $250,000, you
[1509.62 → 1510.62] can have that movie idea.
[1510.62 → 1512.62] That's, that's, that's very conservative.
[1512.62 → 1514.62] Actually, that's a very good value.
[1514.62 → 1515.62] Yeah.
[1515.62 → 1517.62] Everyone should just take us up on that.
[1517.62 → 1518.62] You know what?
[1518.62 → 1520.62] We should just stop making tech videos.
[1520.62 → 1522.62] Just start suggesting new business ideas.
[1522.62 → 1523.62] Yeah.
[1523.62 → 1525.62] We should just, that should be our entire live stream for the rest of the night is we're just
[1525.62 → 1529.62] going to talk about things that videos that we could make instead of tech videos.
[1529.62 → 1530.62] How about, how about.
[1530.62 → 1532.62] And all the viewers went like, yeah.
[1532.62 → 1538.62] We could also try to, um, come up with a business suggestion out of every Twitter question that
[1538.62 → 1539.62] we get.
[1539.62 → 1541.62] Oh, that would be, that would be just unwatchable.
[1541.62 → 1542.62] Okay.
[1542.62 → 1545.62] So let's move on into some of our actual discussion topics.
[1545.62 → 1547.62] So, uh, here we go.
[1547.62 → 1548.62] 79.90.
[1548.62 → 1551.62] How stoked are you on this?
[1551.62 → 1554.62] It was probably smart of them to do it.
[1554.62 → 1555.62] They've been working on it a while.
[1555.62 → 1556.62] Yeah.
[1556.62 → 1559.62] This has been, this has been rumoured for a while.
[1559.62 → 1563.62] So guys, if you haven't seen it already, it's on every news site everywhere is this picture
[1563.62 → 1568.62] of this guy, uh, holding up a 79.90 graphics card.
[1568.62 → 1571.62] It looks like a 12, 13 inch long card.
[1571.62 → 1572.62] That's a long graphics card.
[1572.62 → 1573.62] That's a long graphics card.
[1573.62 → 1574.62] Yeah.
[1574.62 → 1583.62] I mean, guys remember that, uh, Tahiti is a larger graphics core than, uh, GK104.
[1583.62 → 1586.62] So it, uh, it will consume more power.
[1586.62 → 1589.62] It is a more complicated card to build.
[1589.62 → 1596.62] It will output more heat than, than a, uh, a GTX 690, but they have managed to, uh, to,
[1596.62 → 1597.62] to get things going.
[1597.62 → 1600.62] And their claim of it being whispered quiet.
[1600.62 → 1604.62] I 100% believe it because look at that.
[1604.62 → 1607.62] That looks like an Arctic cooling designed heat sink.
[1607.62 → 1608.62] Yeah.
[1608.62 → 1610.62] Those look like a hundred millimetre fans at least.
[1610.62 → 1614.62] Those might be 110, anywhere from a hundred to a hundred and ten mid.
[1614.62 → 1615.62] So those are going to be quiet.
[1615.62 → 1616.62] It's dual slot.
[1616.62 → 1622.62] It looks like they've gone with a single DVI and, uh, four mini display ports.
[1622.62 → 1627.62] So you can drive up to five displays off this guy without any kinds of splitters, which is
[1627.62 → 1629.62] extremely exciting as well.
[1629.62 → 1633.62] It will obviously run infinity because it's their flagship card.
[1633.62 → 1642.62] Um, the one thing that bothers me about the 79.90 is the fact that, and this is, this is in line, you know what,
[1642.62 → 1645.62] maybe we're going to tie in our, our stuttering conversation here.
[1645.62 → 1646.62] Combo two different conversations.
[1646.62 → 1648.62] Did you read the full article on PC per?
[1648.62 → 1649.62] I have skimmed it.
[1649.62 → 1650.62] Okay.
[1650.62 → 1651.62] Did you read the one on a Nanotech?
[1651.62 → 1652.62] I have skimmed it.
[1652.62 → 1653.62] You skimmed both of them.
[1653.62 → 1654.62] Great.
[1654.62 → 1655.62] I'm fine.
[1655.62 → 1656.62] A lot of good you are.
[1656.62 → 1657.62] Um, so, okay.
[1657.62 → 1659.62] Between the two articles, they released them almost the same time.
[1659.62 → 1665.62] And Nanotech's is more in collaboration with AMD and PC perspectives is more in collaboration
[1665.62 → 1671.62] with Nvidia talking about this hot button topic, which is frame times versus frame rates.
[1671.62 → 1678.62] So how long did it take each frame to render versus how many frames in general were shown
[1678.62 → 1683.62] on the screen within a given second, which is FPS frames per second.
[1683.62 → 1689.62] And FPS, general frames per second includes things like a little sliver of a line on one
[1689.62 → 1691.62] side that you don't actually even notice.
[1691.62 → 1694.62] So Nanotech didn't really look at that much.
[1694.62 → 1695.62] Okay.
[1695.62 → 1696.62] So back to more history.
[1696.62 → 1698.62] And we're going to cover this in more depth next week.
[1698.62 → 1705.62] But basically, FRAPS covers how many frames that the game called for to be drawn.
[1705.62 → 1709.62] Whereas some of these new methods, like what PC perspective is doing, where they're using
[1709.62 → 1715.62] a capture card to pull the actual images off the DVI port, are looking at how many frames
[1715.62 → 1717.62] actually got displayed to the user.
[1717.62 → 1718.62] And there is a discrepancy.
[1718.62 → 1724.62] There are dropped frames and there are tiny little frames that were barely even shown.
[1724.62 → 1725.62] And those are counted.
[1725.62 → 1728.62] And those are counted by a FRAPS measurement.
[1728.62 → 1732.62] So what they discovered, and Paper particularly looked at this-
[1732.62 → 1733.62] Wait, wait, one second.
[1733.62 → 1734.62] Just to, okay.
[1734.62 → 1735.62] He's saying FRAPS measurement.
[1735.62 → 1737.62] This is all FPS calculations.
[1737.62 → 1738.62] Yes.
[1738.62 → 1739.62] We use FRAPS.
[1739.62 → 1740.62] A lot of people use FRAPS.
[1740.62 → 1742.62] Everyone uses FRAPS up till now.
[1742.62 → 1743.62] Yes.
[1743.62 → 1747.62] But if you are looking at anything in your game that is telling you the FPS, it's the
[1747.62 → 1748.62] same.
[1748.62 → 1749.62] It's not just FRAPS.
[1749.62 → 1754.62] FRAPS, VGA precision, MSI afterburner, all those tools are going to tell you a frame rate
[1754.62 → 1759.62] that might not actually have anything to do with what your eye is actually seeing.
[1759.62 → 1760.62] Like mind blown, right?
[1760.62 → 1765.62] Because we all thought it was right, or at least pretty darn close for so long.
[1765.62 → 1767.62] So that's, that's, so, okay.
[1767.62 → 1774.62] Going back to that, what Paper discovered was that in Crossfire, the experience may appear
[1774.62 → 1780.62] smoother just because there's so much more horsepower behind it that it's able
[1780.62 → 1786.62] to draw the frames faster and for, for whatever reason, enabling V-Sync fixes the issue to
[1786.62 → 1787.62] a great degree.
[1787.62 → 1789.62] So some people are encountering it, some other ones aren't.
[1789.62 → 1795.62] But generally speaking, running Crossfire actually may not be providing a performance
[1795.62 → 1796.62] benefit.
[1796.62 → 1797.62] Yeah.
[1797.62 → 1799.62] A performance benefit in the not the FRAPS sense.
[1799.62 → 1800.62] Yes.
[1800.62 → 1803.62] So you're going to be drawing, or you're going to be calling for more frames per second and
[1803.62 → 1805.62] the horsepower is there.
[1805.62 → 1810.62] But what actually makes it to your eye may just, it may have all been dropped frames
[1810.62 → 1813.62] and, and what they're calling, shoot, I forget the word for them.
[1813.62 → 1816.62] Um, runts or something like that.
[1816.62 → 1817.62] Right.
[1817.62 → 1818.62] Yeah.
[1818.62 → 1820.62] So these, these frames that actually didn't really mean anything.
[1820.62 → 1822.62] The like sliver frames that no one ever sees.
[1822.62 → 1826.62] That not only do you not necessarily see, but may actually make your gaming experience worse.
[1826.62 → 1827.62] Like you've all seen tearing before, right?
[1827.62 → 1828.62] Yeah.
[1828.62 → 1833.62] Where my hand, okay, so my hand's on the screen like this and there's like a break in my wrist
[1833.62 → 1837.62] where the rest of my arm is kind of over on one side and my hands here and there's like
[1837.62 → 1838.62] this line.
[1838.62 → 1845.62] So Crossfire can actually cause more of those breaks in the frame, making the overall experience
[1845.62 → 1846.62] look choppier.
[1846.62 → 1850.62] And Nvidia isn't a hundred percent clean either.
[1850.62 → 1859.62] But what both the Enacted and Paper articles agreed on was that AMD's got it worse than Nvidia
[1859.62 → 1863.62] right now and that they're working on it very aggressively trying to get it fixed.
[1863.62 → 1871.62] But in the meantime, 7990 is two 7970s and relies on Crossfire for any performance improvement
[1871.62 → 1872.62] over a single card.
[1872.62 → 1877.62] At the same time though, AMD has been very aggressive with their drivers ever since the
[1877.62 → 1878.62] Never Settle drivers.
[1878.62 → 1880.62] So I believe that they will fix this.
[1880.62 → 1883.62] And you want to hear something fascinating about the Never Settle drivers?
[1883.62 → 1888.62] This wasn't called out specifically in either of those articles, but it was alluded too somewhat.
[1888.62 → 1896.62] Around the time that AMD had frame times brought to their attention that they had this stuttering.
[1896.62 → 1901.62] So where you might have a very high frame rate, but you're moving around and there's like a hitch,
[1901.62 → 1906.62] but the frame rate is still okay because there was one frame that had a long frame time and causes that stutter.
[1906.62 → 1912.62] Around the time that AMD had that brought to their attention was around the time they started developing the Never Settle drivers.
[1912.62 → 1923.62] So what AMD had said about this whole conversation is not that they're upset that they had this, that there's this expose on their driver optimizations.
[1923.62 → 1928.62] The thing they said they're upset about is they've been leaving this performance on the table for years, probably.
[1928.62 → 1941.62] Because you look at, you look at AMD's cards, a 7970 is a larger, more complicated, theoretically more powerful graphics card than GTX 680, or graphics core, graphics chip than GTX 680.
[1941.62 → 1947.62] AMD spends more to deliver a 7970 to you than Nvidia spends to deliver you a 680.
[1947.62 → 1951.62] Hard fact. Their coolers cost about the same.
[1951.62 → 1956.62] The PCB design is going to cost more on a more power hungry, larger, more complicated part.
[1956.62 → 1958.62] There are more layers to the PCB, all those things.
[1958.62 → 1962.62] Not only that, they throw three gigs of RAM on you, or on there for you.
[1962.62 → 1963.62] No, they don't throw three gigs of RAM on you.
[1963.62 → 1965.62] Of all the RAM!
[1965.62 → 1971.62] So they throw three gigs of RAM at you versus two on a reference 680.
[1971.62 → 1972.62] It is a more expensive card.
[1972.62 → 1977.62] There is no reason why for so long 680 was able to beat or be competitive with 7970.
[1977.62 → 1984.62] With the latest drivers, every roundup we've done, AMD at the same price point has been just, well, cleaning up.
[1984.62 → 1985.62] Yeah, to be completely honest.
[1985.62 → 1987.62] Not to mention all the free games that they're throwing.
[1987.62 → 1994.62] There's a rumour that in addition to Battlefield 4, there's another huge unreleased title that's going to be part of the game.
[1994.62 → 1996.62] The next Never Settle.
[1996.62 → 1998.62] Never Settle is not ending.
[1998.62 → 1999.62] Holy crap.
[1999.62 → 2003.62] So basically buying an AMD graphics card gives you two to three AAA games.
[2003.62 → 2015.62] Isn't there like, I read something on the forum where someone was talking about, our forum, where someone was talking about how if you built a computer using like all these certain parts, you could just get like an absurd amount of games.
[2015.62 → 2016.62] Yup.
[2016.62 → 2027.62] And it's like if you're building a computer for like, say their parents are trying to give them like some crazy super awesome Christmas present, and you're a family friend or something, you're building the computer for them.
[2027.62 → 2030.62] Like you can deliver this computer to the kid with like six AAA titles.
[2030.62 → 2031.62] That's awesome.
[2031.62 → 2032.62] Holy crap.
[2032.62 → 2033.62] Right.
[2033.62 → 2034.62] That's so much money.
[2034.62 → 2035.62] And you know what?
[2035.62 → 2041.62] AMD is taking that strategy, and actually I don't know if this is public knowledge.
[2041.62 → 2045.62] The deck wasn't marked confidential, so I'm going to go ahead and assume that it's out there.
[2045.62 → 2046.62] Not our fault.
[2046.62 → 2053.62] So I heard a rumour from not an AMD source that AMD is going to be taking this strategy to their CPUs as well.
[2053.62 → 2054.62] Awesome.
[2054.62 → 2055.62] That's smart.
[2055.62 → 2061.62] So they're going to be taking a high-end black edition FX chip, and they're going to be throwing an AAA title or two at it.
[2061.62 → 2070.62] And combine that with our discovery that on Windows 8, the 8350 is already very competitive with the 3570K.
[2070.62 → 2071.62] It got quite a bit stronger.
[2071.62 → 2077.62] And it's 20 bucks cheaper and the platform is anywhere from 20 to 50 dollars cheaper.
[2077.62 → 2079.62] This could be the kick in the butt that AMD needs.
[2079.62 → 2080.62] This could be the kick in the butt that they need.
[2080.62 → 2085.62] Getting like actually enhancing the gaming experience by going yes, you have this gaming machine.
[2085.62 → 2087.62] You don't want to pirate games.
[2087.62 → 2090.62] So here, we'll give you the games.
[2090.62 → 2092.62] You don't want to pirate games, you don't want to pay for games.
[2092.62 → 2098.62] And like a lot of the games I noticed that they're giving out will have, they might still be single player focused games.
[2098.62 → 2100.62] But they'll have a multiplayer aspect.
[2100.62 → 2102.62] Right, so it's a gift that keeps on giving.
[2102.62 → 2103.62] Yeah.
[2103.62 → 2113.62] So speaking of multiplayer, why don't we do a quick sponsor break with our Intel video that we ask you guys to sit and watch for 20 seconds.
[2113.62 → 2117.62] This video is brought to you by our trusted partner Intel.
[2117.62 → 2126.62] For a limited time only with the purchase of any unlocked Core i5 or Core i7 Intel CPU, get a free Intel beanie with a chance to win an Intel snowboard.
[2126.62 → 2129.62] Valid for Canadian and US customers only, some restrictions apply.
[2129.62 → 2132.62] For complete details, visit IntelGamingPromo.com.
[2132.62 → 2133.62] And we're back.
[2133.62 → 2134.62] Thank you.
[2134.62 → 2135.62] That was, I think, the smoothest we've ever executed.
[2135.62 → 2136.62] That's probably the only smooth one we've ever executed.
[2136.62 → 2137.62] No, I think I had one that was okay.
[2137.62 → 2138.62] Oh, did we?
[2138.62 → 2139.62] Okay.
[2139.62 → 2147.62] I think we had one where we screwed up the first one within one live stream, and then we tried it again later in the same live stream.
[2147.62 → 2148.62] Oh, okay.
[2148.62 → 2149.62] And you fixed it later on.
[2149.62 → 2150.62] Right.
[2150.62 → 2151.62] Yes.
[2151.62 → 2152.62] Right.
[2152.62 → 2153.62] Right.
[2153.62 → 2154.62] That one was perfect the first time.
[2154.62 → 2155.62] I still want that snowboard.
[2155.62 → 2161.62] So, well, I think they got enough entries now that we are not going to have a chance to win a snowboard.
[2161.62 → 2162.62] I have an entry.
[2162.62 → 2163.62] You have an entry?
[2163.62 → 2164.62] I have an entry.
[2164.62 → 2165.62] I wish you luck.
[2165.62 → 2166.62] You know what?
[2166.62 → 2168.62] I've read the terms and conditions and I don't think you're eligible.
[2168.62 → 2169.62] Really?
[2169.62 → 2171.62] Because you worked for a company that worked with Intel on the promo.
[2171.62 → 2172.62] Oh.
[2172.62 → 2174.62] But if you win it, I won't tell anybody, so whatever.
[2174.62 → 2175.62] It's like...
[2175.62 → 2178.62] None of you saw that.
[2178.62 → 2181.62] No, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have an entry.
[2181.62 → 2182.62] I don't know.
[2182.62 → 2186.62] Someone's going to track you down on a ski slope somewhere, and they're going to be like,
[2186.62 → 2187.62] you.
[2187.62 → 2190.62] I'm going to have to like, carbon fibre wrap it or something.
[2190.62 → 2191.62] I know.
[2191.62 → 2192.62] Wouldn't that be the worst thing ever?
[2192.62 → 2199.62] Like winning some balling, like cannot have awesome swag and putting like, like my little
[2199.62 → 2201.62] pony stickers all over it.
[2201.62 → 2203.62] To make it unrecognizable.
[2203.62 → 2204.62] Yes.
[2204.62 → 2205.62] That would be horrible.
[2205.62 → 2208.62] You'd be the only one who knows how cool you are.
[2208.62 → 2210.62] Which is basically how it works now.
[2210.62 → 2211.62] Oh.
[2211.62 → 2212.62] Oh.
[2212.62 → 2213.62] That was not nice.
[2213.62 → 2214.62] Come on, that was pretty good.
[2214.62 → 2215.62] That was a good burn.
[2215.62 → 2216.62] Oh.
[2216.62 → 2217.62] Oh.
[2217.62 → 2218.62] Ouch.
[2218.62 → 2219.62] Okay.
[2219.62 → 2225.62] Anyway, speaking of enhancing the game experience, we want to have a quick conversation about the
[2225.62 → 2227.62] WD Monet series of routers.
[2227.62 → 2228.62] This is a sponsored segment.
[2228.62 → 2234.62] WD is helping us give away four routers to unsuspecting live stream viewers.
[2234.62 → 2239.62] So it would only be appropriate if we tell you exactly why you should care about this particular
[2239.62 → 2240.62] router.
[2240.62 → 2244.62] So I'm, this is the one that we actually used for an episode of NCI Tech Tips.
[2244.62 → 2247.62] Do you mind being my Anna White and holding that for me?
[2247.62 → 2248.62] You're so hot.
[2248.62 → 2251.62] That's why it works so well to have you be Anna White for me.
[2251.62 → 2252.62] Because I'm touching it.
[2252.62 → 2253.62] Is that part of it too?
[2253.62 → 2254.62] Yeah.
[2254.62 → 2257.62] It's part of the sensual massage of the router that really enhances the viewing experience
[2257.62 → 2259.62] for, well for me anyway.
[2259.62 → 2260.62] Right.
[2260.62 → 2261.62] I don't know about the rest of them.
[2261.62 → 2262.62] Right.
[2262.62 → 2264.62] I heard the audience is pretty into you though.
[2264.62 → 2265.62] I'm, yeah.
[2265.62 → 2266.62] It might be, it might be all good.
[2266.62 → 2267.62] I don't know.
[2267.62 → 2269.62] I mean there should be a lot of girls watching this week.
[2269.62 → 2270.62] Oh.
[2270.62 → 2271.62] At least 97%.
[2271.62 → 2272.62] At least 97%.
[2272.62 → 2273.62] I might have that statistic backwards.
[2273.62 → 2274.62] Yeah, I think it's backwards.
[2274.62 → 2275.62] But, you know what?
[2275.62 → 2279.62] We appreciate our female viewers very much though because they keep us in line.
[2279.62 → 2282.62] Because there's been a couple of times when I've said stuff that they didn't like
[2282.62 → 2284.62] and they are all over me.
[2284.62 → 2285.62] They're like, they're on that.
[2285.62 → 2288.62] They're like, Linus, that was actually insensitive.
[2288.62 → 2289.62] And I'm like, okay, you know what?
[2289.62 → 2290.62] You're actually right.
[2290.62 → 2291.62] My bad.
[2291.62 → 2292.62] So they're-
[2292.62 → 2293.62] But 3% of you are completely correct.
[2293.62 → 2297.62] They hold me accountable in a way that I think is actually valuable.
[2297.62 → 2302.62] It's like the last thing I want, see because if they let me know right away, then I'll
[2302.62 → 2307.62] already know what my wife's going to be mad about when I go back inside the house if
[2307.62 → 2310.62] she's tuned into the live stream.
[2310.62 → 2313.62] That's way more valid of a point than I thought it was going to be.
[2313.62 → 2318.62] And the funny part is I- sometimes it'll be a jab at how there's no PC girl gamers.
[2318.62 → 2325.62] But my wife has actually played like a butt ton of Left 4 Dead, a ton of Team Fortress 2.
[2325.62 → 2326.62] She's played like-
[2326.62 → 2328.62] We're still going to have our Team Fortress 2 land.
[2328.62 → 2329.62] That's going to be awesome, actually.
[2329.62 → 2330.62] We should totally do that.
[2330.62 → 2331.62] Yeah.
[2331.62 → 2335.62] But yeah, like she's actually like not bad at video games, and she's not like a stereotypical
[2335.62 → 2336.62] girl gamer or anything.
[2336.62 → 2340.62] Like you'd never-you'd never pick her out as any kind of stereotype anything.
[2340.62 → 2342.62] But- but anyway.
[2342.62 → 2343.62] Okay.
[2343.62 → 2348.62] So we used this very router that you see to- to make this video for NCI.
[2348.62 → 2352.62] So for those of you who aren't from Canada, NCI is a Canadian retailer.
[2352.62 → 2357.62] So I'm just going to skip to the part where we did our torture test.
[2357.62 → 2360.62] And I'm going to actually make you guys sit through this.
[2360.62 → 2364.62] It's only a couple of minutes long, and it really does showcase the features of these routers
[2364.62 → 2365.62] in a very meaningful way.
[2365.62 → 2366.62] Here we go.
[2366.62 → 2372.62] NC-Hellhole, otherwise known as Slick's House, where we are going to be doing our torture test
[2372.62 → 2380.62] on the Western Digital Monet N900 Central router to see if it can handle anything we can throw
[2380.62 → 2381.62] at it pretty much.
[2381.62 → 2387.62] His internet connection is 25 megabits down, 2 megabits up, and we are absolutely hammering
[2387.62 → 2388.62] it.
[2388.62 → 2392.62] We have Diablo 3 as well as another game updating right now.
[2392.62 → 2398.62] We have an FTP download going on this notebook over a wired connection that is downloading
[2398.62 → 2402.62] my cat videos at around 650 kilobytes per second.
[2402.62 → 2407.62] We have a Skype call being made between us and Slick right here.
[2407.62 → 2408.62] Slick say hi.
[2408.62 → 2409.62] Hello.
[2409.62 → 2414.62] And the internet connection running on Slick's PC is actually a separate one.
[2414.62 → 2419.62] We are wirelessly using the neighbours connection which we of course have permission for.
[2419.62 → 2424.62] We are streaming, ah yes, we have one of his other roommates streaming on XSplit.
[2424.62 → 2429.62] We have two torrent clients running on separate PCs all running off the Monet Central here that
[2429.62 → 2431.62] are going both up and down.
[2431.62 → 2438.62] And finally we are streaming an HD video on Netflix on this other iPad.
[2438.62 → 2445.62] So through all this let's have a look at what we have done to Slick's internet connection
[2445.62 → 2449.62] which remember guys used to be 25 megabits down, 2 megabits up.
[2449.62 → 2455.62] Now the thing to remember is that fast track technology actually dynamically analyzes the
[2455.62 → 2459.62] kind of traffic going through your network and optimizes your connection thusly.
[2459.62 → 2467.62] So for example you can see that in our speed test we got a ping of almost one second to
[2467.62 → 2468.62] the nearest server.
[2468.62 → 2475.62] Our upload speed has been decimated to .38 megabit per second and our download speed is more than half consumed.
[2475.62 → 2482.62] And in spite of that when I take one of my higher priority applications such as
[2482.62 → 2484.62] Hey Slick!
[2484.62 → 2487.62] See there we go.
[2487.62 → 2493.62] Such as Skype or my Netflix video stream and I want to navigate to a different part of the video.
[2493.62 → 2504.62] We are not seeing slow down here but what we are seeing is we are seeing dynamic slow down on things like our video game updates and things like our FTP downloads and torrents.
[2504.62 → 2510.62] So I hope this served as a very practical demonstration of what fast track technology does.
[2510.62 → 2523.62] Remember the key difference between fast track plus which is on the 900 routers and fast track is that fast track plus doesn't even require besides no user input no profiles even to be loaded into the router.
[2523.62 → 2530.62] It analyzes the traffic and adjusts for what it deems to be most important completely automatically.
[2530.62 → 2532.62] Thank you for joining us in Slick's humble abode.
[2532.62 → 2533.62] Alright so I think we are back here.
[2533.62 → 2534.62] I'm just going to go ahead and close that and make sure that we are back.
[2534.62 → 2536.62] I'm just going to go ahead and close that and make sure that we are back.
[2536.62 → 2537.62] Yes we are back.
[2537.62 → 2543.62] No matter how hard you hammer the N900 in this case we were using the central, but they are the same basic hardware in here.
[2543.62 → 2554.62] No matter how hard you hit it is will continue to prioritize your HD movies for yours and I know this because Team Digital tweeted about our stream tonight.
[2554.62 → 2564.62] WD tweeted about our stream so you might not be actually following me and Slick on Twitter and didn't touch anything else.
[2564.62 → 2571.62] So if you don't want to think about it if you want to make sure that the right network traffic is always being prioritized.
[2571.62 → 2576.62] You could do a lot worse for yourself than picking up a WD Monet N900.
[2576.62 → 2577.62] My bad you guys.
[2577.62 → 2580.62] So anyway we are running the giveaway a little bit differently.
[2580.62 → 2583.62] Instead of having you tweet at us because you don't necessarily follow us yet.
[2583.62 → 2585.62] Hopefully you will follow us soon.
[2585.62 → 2590.62] We are going to have you send an email with the correct answer.
[2590.62 → 2591.62] So this is going to be a pop quiz.
[2591.62 → 2597.62] I am going to cover the router again sort of very briefly because that was more of a showcase of Fast Track Plus.
[2597.62 → 2604.62] Which is WD's intelligent technology that sorts through your networking traffic and automatically prioritizes.
[2604.62 → 2608.62] So they are sending firmware updates that are going to allow it to continue to prioritize.
[2608.62 → 2615.62] The 900's are the higher end routers with Fast Track Plus are the ones that do it automatically.
[2615.62 → 2621.62] Whereas Fast Track relies on profiles that are sent out with subsequent firmware.
[2621.62 → 2625.62] So the Monet N750 and 600 are using Fast Track.
[2625.62 → 2627.62] Whereas this has Fast Track Plus.
[2627.62 → 2632.62] And the central one which also has a hard drive inside it also has Fast Track Plus.
[2632.62 → 2635.62] So the benefits of this particular router I am going to go through them very briefly.
[2635.62 → 2641.62] And of course you guys are all paying very close attention so that you all have a chance to win their signed router.
[2641.62 → 2647.62] And the other ones are the fact that it has 7 gigabit Ethernet ports compared to the industry standard which is about 4.
[2647.62 → 2650.62] It's great because then you don't have to add a switch to your network necessarily.
[2650.62 → 2653.62] I don't know about you guys, but I have a lot more than 4 network connected devices in my house.
[2653.62 → 2654.62] How about you?
[2654.62 → 2656.62] I fight with switches all the time, actually.
[2656.62 → 2659.62] My dad does a lot of what's called Brink.
[2659.62 → 2661.62] We have a Brink and folding section on our forum.
[2661.62 → 2663.62] Go check it out if you're interested in that kind of stuff.
[2663.62 → 2665.62] And my dad does this Brink thing like crazy.
[2665.62 → 2667.62] So we've got multiple computers on there.
[2667.62 → 2669.62] Did you just say your dad Blinks like crazy?
[2669.62 → 2671.62] Oh my god I'm not even going to go into that.
[2671.62 → 2673.62] And they all have to be connected to the internet.
[2673.62 → 2676.62] So we fight with switches all the time because my router only has 4 plugs on it.
[2676.62 → 2677.62] Right.
[2677.62 → 2682.62] So we've got like all the people's computers plus 2 more that we need for like home theatre etc.
[2682.62 → 2683.62] Right.
[2683.62 → 2687.62] And then all the folding machines need their own so we've got a router and then 2 switches.
[2687.62 → 2695.62] And remember guys that each switch that you run out means that every computer on the other end now has a single 1 gigabit backbone
[2695.62 → 2700.62] back to the main switching routing power that is powering your network.
[2700.62 → 2708.62] So while they could transfer to each other at full gigabit, if these guys had traffic going here and here and sort of here all over the place,
[2708.62 → 2709.62] there's going to be a bottleneck there.
[2709.62 → 2714.62] So having more native ports on your router is ideal if you can get away with it.
[2714.62 → 2720.62] Also, because it's Western Digital and they are a storage company, it has 2 USB ports, one of which is USB 3.
[2720.62 → 2724.62] So you can actually add additional storage to the router itself.
[2724.62 → 2729.62] A lot of routers have that feature these days, but I mean it's WD, so I tend to trust them in terms of storage.
[2729.62 → 2734.62] So you can easily add things like My Book Live to, I think we have a My Book Live there.
[2734.62 → 2738.62] Nope, that is a My Book Thunderbolt Duo.
[2738.62 → 2740.62] And we have a My Passport back there.
[2740.62 → 2742.62] So I'd love to show you guys a My Book Live, but I actually can't.
[2742.62 → 2745.62] So here you go guys, pop quiz.
[2745.62 → 2749.62] We're going to do the first 3 now, and we're going to do the last one at the very end.
[2749.62 → 2758.62] So I would like you to email LinusTechTips, L-I-N-U-S-T-E-C-H-T-I-P-S at gmail.com.
[2758.62 → 2762.62] Go ahead, get your email client ready now.
[2762.62 → 2765.62] LinusTechTips at gmail.com.
[2765.62 → 2770.62] Subject line, if you do not submit it with this subject line, I am not going to accept your entry.
[2770.62 → 2771.62] I will be doing a filter.
[2771.62 → 2772.62] Only people in the U.S. can win.
[2772.62 → 2774.62] Oh yeah, only people in the U.S. guys, sorry.
[2774.62 → 2778.62] Unfortunately, we are from Canada and that doesn't count.
[2778.62 → 2781.62] Western Digital U.S. is sending out the prizes.
[2781.62 → 2783.62] So they're the ones that are in charge of that.
[2783.62 → 2784.62] Okay, thank you.
[2784.62 → 2785.62] That was a good thing to call out.
[2785.62 → 2786.62] You did well.
[2786.62 → 2790.62] So, question number one.
[2790.62 → 2797.62] What is the difference, in as much detail as possible, given that you have to be the first one to reply,
[2797.62 → 2802.62] between Fast Track and Fast Track Plus?
[2805.62 → 2806.62] Can I sing that song?
[2806.62 → 2808.62] Like, is that allowed or is that like copyright infringement?
[2808.62 → 2811.62] I think singing it or humming it should be fine, should it not?
[2811.62 → 2814.62] As long as we don't actually download an MP3 of it and play it.
[2814.62 → 2815.62] Actually play the song.
[2815.62 → 2816.62] Okay, can we sing it together?
[2816.62 → 2831.62] Should we make them do that every time?
[2831.62 → 2833.62] Oh, that would be kind of horrible.
[2833.62 → 2834.62] Wouldn't that be awful?
[2834.62 → 2837.62] We'll probably lose like 80% of our stream.
[2837.62 → 2838.62] 80% of our stream.
[2838.62 → 2839.62] Can you imagine someone tuning in during that?
[2839.62 → 2842.62] Just like, what is this?
[2842.62 → 2844.62] Why is this on Twitch?
[2844.62 → 2846.62] Okay, next question guys.
[2846.62 → 2851.62] We're not going to announce the winners on the stream, because we've had bad experiences with that in the past.
[2851.62 → 2852.62] We will contact you by email.
[2852.62 → 2854.62] We'll let you know if you won.
[2854.62 → 2862.62] Because we've had experiences with things arriving out of order and then later we find out that the person we thought won actually didn't win.
[2862.62 → 2863.62] Okay.
[2863.62 → 2864.62] Okay.
[2864.62 → 2875.62] So what would you say are the main advantages compared to competitors of the Monet N900, compared to other high-end competitors?
[2875.62 → 2878.62] Bearing in mind it is an almost $200 router.
[2878.62 → 2887.62] Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.
[2887.62 → 2888.62] Alright.
[2888.62 → 2894.62] Last question for our Q&A, and this one is not related to Western Digital, although the last one will be.
[2894.62 → 2900.62] Which Team Digital player has an S in his name?
[2900.62 → 2906.62] This is one that you can Google pretty easily I guess, but we're going to be picking the best and first answer for each of them.
[2906.62 → 2911.62] We'll contact you by email, and without further ado we're going to get further into our live stream here.
[2911.62 → 2913.62] Do you have any topics?
[2913.62 → 2915.62] Uh, not really to be completely honest.
[2915.62 → 2920.62] Because I asked you at the beginning of the live stream if you had any topics, and you were like, yeah, but I don't need to brief you on them.
[2920.62 → 2922.62] Do you actually not have any topics?
[2922.62 → 2923.62] Well I had $79.90.
[2923.62 → 2924.62] Oh.
[2924.62 → 2925.62] I took that.
[2925.62 → 2926.62] Oh, okay.
[2926.62 → 2927.62] Oh yeah, that's right.
[2927.62 → 2929.62] That's what you get for emailing me your topic ideas earlier in the week.
[2929.62 → 2930.62] I sent you a few of these, actually.
[2930.62 → 2931.62] Yeah, I know.
[2931.62 → 2932.62] Yeah.
[2932.62 → 2933.62] I added them.
[2933.62 → 2934.62] So you just took, that's where my topics are.
[2934.62 → 2935.62] Well now they're mine.
[2935.62 → 2937.62] They're on my live stream outline, so they're mine.
[2937.62 → 2939.62] But you said this is the whole live stream outline.
[2939.62 → 2940.62] Yeah, but I wrote it.
[2940.62 → 2942.62] Which I have manually added to at this point.
[2942.62 → 2943.62] Have you?
[2943.62 → 2944.62] What did you add?
[2944.62 → 2945.62] Like a space?
[2945.62 → 2946.62] At the bottom.
[2946.62 → 2947.62] At the bottom?
[2947.62 → 2948.62] Oh, you, okay.
[2948.62 → 2949.62] Good work.
[2949.62 → 2950.62] He added one link.
[2950.62 → 2951.62] Yeah.
[2951.62 → 2952.62] Okay.
[2952.62 → 2954.62] Um, you know what?
[2954.62 → 2956.62] Let's do some Twitter Q&A.
[2956.62 → 2963.62] So, uh, let's see what the peeps on Twitter have to say about our awesome giveaway.
[2963.62 → 2966.62] Um, people wanted to know the subject line.
[2966.62 → 2967.62] Okay, I guess.
[2967.62 → 2968.62] If you want to know by now, you're probably too late.
[2968.62 → 2969.62] Yeah, I give up on that.
[2969.62 → 2972.62] Um, but it would be nice if the subject line was the question.
[2972.62 → 2973.62] Sure.
[2973.62 → 2975.62] Yeah, that's probably way too late for that.
[2975.62 → 2976.62] Don't worry guys.
[2976.62 → 2977.62] We will sift through it.
[2977.62 → 2981.62] We will find whoever answered the question first, and you will be the winner of an awesome,
[2981.62 → 2987.62] awesome router that, uh, has full, uh, full dual-band N450.
[2987.62 → 2992.62] So that's a total of N900 transfer speeds for up to 900 megabits per second.
[2992.62 → 2993.62] Theoretical.
[2993.62 → 2995.62] Bear in mind there's a lot of overhead with wireless.
[2995.62 → 2996.62] Yeah.
[2996.62 → 2998.62] So you're not going to see that in the real world.
[2998.62 → 3001.62] But, it'll be, I mean, there's the same overhead on all the other wireless, so.
[3001.62 → 3003.62] Having your cap higher is a good thing.
[3003.62 → 3004.62] Yeah.
[3004.62 → 3005.62] Yeah, see, there, that.
[3005.62 → 3008.62] Are you, is that, is that a short people joke?
[3008.62 → 3013.62] It could be, because, you know, just, I'm just going to sit up straight for a second.
[3013.62 → 3017.62] I'm still further away from the camera, my chair is still lower, and there's still height
[3017.62 → 3018.62] discrepancy.
[3018.62 → 3020.62] Actually, I don't think your chair is that much lower today.
[3020.62 → 3021.62] It's just that you are fatter than I.
[3021.62 → 3022.62] Oh no, I was.
[3022.62 → 3023.62] So it weighed it down well.
[3023.62 → 3024.62] It's not a, wow.
[3024.62 → 3026.62] Hey, if you're going to go, what a jerk.
[3026.62 → 3030.62] If you're going to go after me for being short, I'm going after you for weighing more.
[3030.62 → 3033.62] I'm also, well, okay, weighing more because I'm larger.
[3033.62 → 3034.62] I'm not fat.
[3034.62 → 3035.62] Um.
[3035.62 → 3040.62] Okay, fine, fair enough.
[3040.62 → 3043.62] All right.
[3043.62 → 3045.62] Absolutely, oh, oh, line exception.
[3045.62 → 3046.62] Oh, okay.
[3046.62 → 3048.62] I think, I think we did address that.
[3048.62 → 3049.62] Yeah, we fixed that.
[3049.62 → 3050.62] Okay.
[3050.62 → 3052.62] Decimated means taken down by a tenth.
[3052.62 → 3054.62] That is a very interesting thing.
[3054.62 → 3055.62] It makes a lot of sense.
[3055.62 → 3056.62] I did not know that.
[3056.62 → 3057.62] That actually totally makes sense.
[3057.62 → 3058.62] That's awesome.
[3058.62 → 3059.62] That's really cool.
[3059.62 → 3060.62] Thanks for that little tip.
[3060.62 → 3061.62] Good work, Richard.
[3061.62 → 3063.62] You get a gold star for Tweet of the Night.
[3063.62 → 3064.62] One internet.
[3064.62 → 3065.62] One internet for you.
[3065.62 → 3068.62] Coco or Fruity Pet, you know what?
[3068.62 → 3071.62] Being Canadian, I have never had Pebbles.
[3071.62 → 3074.62] Yeah, they don't have Pebbles in Canada.
[3074.62 → 3075.62] Do you know what Pebbles are?
[3075.62 → 3077.62] I think I've heard of them.
[3077.62 → 3079.62] Yeah, it's like a Flintstones themed cereal.
[3079.62 → 3081.62] Yeah, I've never seen it.
[3081.62 → 3085.62] Yeah, I saw ads for it in like Archie Comics, but I've never actually seen it in a store.
[3085.62 → 3086.62] Oh, yeah.
[3086.62 → 3087.62] Yeah.
[3087.62 → 3088.62] That's probably where I've heard of it then.
[3088.62 → 3089.62] I used to read Archie Comics.
[3089.62 → 3090.62] Oh, there you go.
[3090.62 → 3091.62] Someone finally noticed your thing.
[3091.62 → 3092.62] You get to talk about it.
[3092.62 → 3093.62] Yay!
[3093.62 → 3094.62] Nope, nope.
[3094.62 → 3095.62] What?
[3095.62 → 3096.62] Oh, okay.
[3096.62 → 3097.62] Alright, okay.
[3097.62 → 3102.62] So yeah, Slick has a copy of Battle toads here for some reason.
[3102.62 → 3105.62] It's talking about how AMD could...
[3105.62 → 3108.62] Yeah, well, our show is about technology.
[3108.62 → 3112.62] Intel happens to be a sponsor of our show, so it's like...
[3112.62 → 3114.62] I like Intel's promotional items.
[3114.62 → 3115.62] I think there's...
[3115.62 → 3117.62] I think a lot of creativity goes into them.
[3117.62 → 3121.62] They've had a Rubik's Cube, a really sweet mouse pad that I think...
[3122.62 → 3123.62] I might have one here.
[3123.62 → 3125.62] By the way, sorry guys, I'm still sick.
[3125.62 → 3126.62] You're always sick.
[3126.62 → 3127.62] Yeah.
[3131.62 → 3132.62] Check this out.
[3134.62 → 3135.62] Ugh!
[3135.62 → 3137.62] They gave away these mouse pads a little while ago.
[3137.62 → 3138.62] That's totally beast.
[3138.62 → 3139.62] Which is like a huge...
[3139.62 → 3143.62] You know how most promotional mouse pads are things that you actually would never consider
[3143.62 → 3145.62] using as an actual gamer?
[3145.62 → 3148.62] It's like big and thick and just good.
[3148.62 → 3151.62] Rubber back, cloth pad, nice tight weave.
[3151.62 → 3153.62] Personally, I like that.
[3153.62 → 3155.62] Got a cool graphic on it.
[3155.62 → 3156.62] So they had that.
[3156.62 → 3157.62] They had the Rubik's Cubes.
[3157.62 → 3162.62] They are doing those free takes or beanies as I guess Americans call them.
[3162.62 → 3164.62] There's a slight difference between a UK and a beanie.
[3164.62 → 3165.62] Is there?
[3165.62 → 3168.62] Yeah, takes go all the way down, and then you fold up the bottom.
[3168.62 → 3170.62] And beanies just go down.
[3170.62 → 3171.62] Okay then.
[3171.62 → 3173.62] I learned another thing today.
[3173.62 → 3174.62] Another...
[3174.62 → 3175.62] Decimated I think is actually cool.
[3175.62 → 3176.62] I think that was way better than yours.
[3176.62 → 3179.62] The difference between takes and beanies just doesn't really matter.
[3179.62 → 3181.62] No, but I learned it.
[3181.62 → 3185.62] And that's the important part because knowledge is half the battle.
[3185.62 → 3191.62] I mean, is it quite on the same level as giving gamers games?
[3191.62 → 3192.62] I don't know.
[3192.62 → 3194.62] It's still cool things though.
[3194.62 → 3195.62] And like the snowboard is pretty cool.
[3195.62 → 3196.62] It's pretty...
[3196.62 → 3198.62] Like I like swag.
[3198.62 → 3199.62] Yeah.
[3199.62 → 3200.62] I do too.
[3200.62 → 3201.62] Some of my most...
[3201.62 → 3202.62] Like one of the...
[3202.62 → 3203.62] You know what?
[3203.62 → 3207.62] I think it's the only swag item that's actually on my desk.
[3207.62 → 3210.62] My computer desk is my Intel bobble head.
[3210.62 → 3211.62] Have you seen that thing?
[3211.62 → 3212.62] Yeah.
[3212.62 → 3213.62] It is so cool.
[3213.62 → 3214.62] That's pretty cool.
[3214.62 → 3215.62] It's...
[3215.62 → 3216.62] Sorry.
[3216.62 → 3217.62] I was just going to say what it is.
[3217.62 → 3218.62] Go for it.
[3218.62 → 3219.62] It's a plaster bobble head.
[3219.62 → 3221.62] It's about this big.
[3221.62 → 3224.62] And it has like an Intel bunny suit guy and the head bobbles.
[3224.62 → 3225.62] And then it has a...
[3225.62 → 3226.62] He has his hand out here, and it holds your pen.
[3226.62 → 3227.62] Yeah.
[3227.62 → 3228.62] And I'm just like...
[3228.62 → 3229.62] That is...
[3229.62 → 3230.62] Like I love really cool unique swag.
[3230.62 → 3231.62] So...
[3231.62 → 3232.62] Every year I go to PAX.
[3232.62 → 3233.62] Sorry, I thought you were done talking.
[3233.62 → 3234.62] No, I'm done.
[3234.62 → 3237.62] Every year you go to PAX, you get a lanyard with your badge on it.
[3237.62 → 3238.62] Um...
[3238.62 → 3244.02] And every single year that me and my group of friends goes to PAX, I at least attach all the
[3244.02 → 3247.62] attachable swag I possibly can to that lanyard.
[3247.62 → 3249.62] And then at the end of the year, I hang it up on a hook in my room.
[3249.62 → 3250.62] So I have all these lanyards.
[3250.62 → 3256.62] Like eight lanyards with just like all these random like pins and random other swag stuff
[3256.62 → 3257.62] all over them.
[3257.62 → 3259.62] And I can remember like what booth giveaway what.
[3259.62 → 3261.62] And it's kind of cool.
[3261.62 → 3268.62] So uh, DS Barlow gets mad Internets for finishing rebuilding his PC during the stream.
[3268.62 → 3271.62] Uh, however, we're afraid to click the link because...
[3271.62 → 3272.62] We've had problems before.
[3272.62 → 3273.62] Yeah.
[3273.62 → 3274.62] We've had problems with that.
[3274.62 → 3279.62] With like things screaming through the speakers and then that gets to everybody else, and it's
[3279.62 → 3280.62] just ugly.
[3280.62 → 3284.62] I think Kevin wins the Internets for being our most astute viewer ever asking if you happen
[3284.62 → 3286.62] to be a Firefox user.
[3286.62 → 3287.62] And next.
[3287.62 → 3288.62] And...
[3288.62 → 3289.62] Next tweet!
[3289.62 → 3290.62] Moving right along.
[3290.62 → 3303.62] Uh, we have a viewer asking what is the main difference between the new DDR4 RAM as opposed
[3303.62 → 3304.62] to DDR3.
[3304.62 → 3309.62] You know what, I haven't done too much looking into DDR4, but what I have done has led me to
[3309.62 → 3316.62] that it is higher frequency, higher density, lower power, higher latency.
[3316.62 → 3320.62] Just like every single other iteration.
[3320.62 → 3326.62] Uh, so pretty much what we're gonna, what we're going to be looking at is a bit of a change in
[3326.62 → 3332.62] terms of how, um, how the memory controllers are going to be optimized because with DDR1 it was
[3332.62 → 3333.62] all about latency.
[3333.62 → 3338.62] So, if you guys aren't familiar with memory specs, the main ones are your frequency, which
[3338.62 → 3341.62] is the megahertz or gigahertz that it runs at.
[3341.62 → 3344.62] Or gigahertz if you prefer I pronounce it the way most people do it.
[3344.62 → 3345.62] Gigahertz.
[3345.62 → 3346.62] Gigahertz is technically correct.
[3346.62 → 3347.62] I know.
[3347.62 → 3348.62] Anyway.
[3348.62 → 3353.62] Um, so the gigahertz it runs at as well as the voltage that is required to run at those
[3353.62 → 3356.62] rated gigahertz and latency timings.
[3356.62 → 3359.62] So, so there's voltage, gigahertz and latency timings.
[3359.62 → 3362.62] So, latency was everything with DDR1.
[3362.62 → 3365.62] DDR1 you wanted like CAS 2 latency.
[3365.62 → 3369.62] You wanted your like BH5s and TCCDs.
[3369.62 → 3371.62] Those were the most popular DDR.
[3371.62 → 3372.62] I feel so old.
[3372.62 → 3374.62] Like who knows stuff like that?
[3374.62 → 3375.62] Only old people.
[3375.62 → 3376.62] You're, you're old.
[3376.62 → 3377.62] I know.
[3377.62 → 3378.62] Like do you, have you ever heard of BH5s?
[3378.62 → 3379.62] I've heard of it.
[3379.62 → 3380.62] Never really cared.
[3380.62 → 3384.62] Cause at that point in time I was like, I want high capacity RAM so that my game will
[3384.62 → 3385.62] run.
[3385.62 → 3386.62] Okay.
[3386.62 → 3387.62] To give you some idea.
[3387.62 → 3390.62] High end BH5s were 256 Meg dims.
[3390.62 → 3391.62] You know.
[3391.62 → 3396.62] And you'd pay like 700 bucks for a 512 kit of BH5s.
[3396.62 → 3398.62] See at that point in time I was.
[3398.62 → 3399.62] Like high end BH5s.
[3399.62 → 3400.62] Like Kingston Hyper.
[3400.62 → 3401.62] Yeah.
[3401.62 → 3406.62] That's when I was at the mode where I'm like okay, me and my friends all need gaming machines
[3406.62 → 3408.62] and we all have no money.
[3408.62 → 3409.62] Yeah.
[3409.62 → 3410.62] Okay.
[3410.62 → 3411.62] We need this minimum spec.
[3411.62 → 3412.62] We need this minimum spec.
[3412.62 → 3413.62] Let's buy it.
[3413.62 → 3414.62] I never had BH5s.
[3414.62 → 3415.62] I never had anything that cool.
[3415.62 → 3420.62] I had cheapo Samsung no heat spreader memory for my first gaming machine.
[3420.62 → 3421.62] So, so whatever.
[3421.62 → 3422.62] Yeah.
[3422.62 → 3423.62] Anyway.
[3423.62 → 3425.62] So, it was all about latency.
[3425.62 → 3426.62] Frequencies were quite low.
[3426.62 → 3432.62] So DDR1 frequencies according to DEX specs were only 266, 333 and 400.
[3432.62 → 3433.62] Those were the only DEX specs.
[3433.62 → 3435.62] There were higher ones, obviously.
[3435.62 → 3438.62] There's always guys like Kingston, Corsair, OCT at the time.
[3438.62 → 3442.62] So, you know, overclocking memory way past spec and then selling it to gamers who then overclocked
[3442.62 → 3443.62] their motherboards to match.
[3443.62 → 3449.62] Also, memory, like memory, memory latencies and frequencies mattered so much more.
[3449.62 → 3453.62] You wanted the latencies as tight as possible and the frequencies as high as possible because
[3453.62 → 3459.62] you could actually EEK extra system performance out of them before dual channel memory just made
[3459.62 → 3460.62] it all totally irrelevant.
[3460.62 → 3463.62] Uh, AMD processors, 8350.
[3463.62 → 3465.62] Particularly that as well.
[3465.62 → 3466.62] I actually, you know, wait, what?
[3466.62 → 3467.62] The 83, what about the?
[3467.62 → 3469.62] The 8350 can benefit from higher speeds.
[3469.62 → 3470.62] Okay, that's true.
[3470.62 → 3472.62] And Apus from AMD benefit again.
[3472.62 → 3475.62] So there was a long period in the middle where they didn't really benefit starting with the
[3475.62 → 3481.62] Athlon 64 which decreased because every, all the performance benefits that you could
[3481.62 → 3483.62] gain from memory were so dependent on latencies at the time.
[3483.62 → 3488.62] AMD by taking the memory controller and moving it off the chipset onto the CPU made the latency
[3488.62 → 3492.62] so negligible that all of a sudden all the optimizing we were doing to get that latency,
[3492.62 → 3494.62] AMD could just do it with the cheapest possible memory.
[3494.62 → 3495.62] Yep.
[3495.62 → 3496.62] Okay.
[3496.62 → 3502.62] Along comes DDR2 which Intel benefited from more than AMD because they needed more bandwidth.
[3502.62 → 3506.62] Um, so DDR2 increased latencies.
[3506.62 → 3511.62] So on DDR2 a typical, a typical memory latency would be kind of like a CAS.
[3511.62 → 3513.62] Oh crap, I can't even remember.
[3513.62 → 3516.62] Like a CAS 5 I think was sort of typical cheapo DDR2.
[3516.62 → 3518.62] That's what I was talking about.
[3518.62 → 3519.62] And then frequencies got much higher.
[3519.62 → 3524.62] So you could get to 533, 667, 800, 1066.
[3524.62 → 3526.62] These were like DDR2 frequencies.
[3526.62 → 3529.62] Um, so then DDR3 did, and, and lower voltages.
[3529.62 → 3533.62] So this is not something that individual users necessarily care about.
[3533.62 → 3538.62] We could all be still running DDR1 if it could run fast enough in our desktop systems, and it wouldn't matter.
[3538.62 → 3543.62] But lower voltages are important for reducing power consumption, which if you've got a ton of machines running,
[3543.62 → 3551.62] say for example in, uh, blade racks in a large supercomputer, then all of a sudden that extra watt that each of your, you know,
[3551.62 → 3555.62] million Simms uses starts to add up pretty quickly.
[3555.62 → 3556.62] So DDR2 did that.
[3556.62 → 3558.62] DDR3 increased latencies again.
[3558.62 → 3564.62] A typical DDR3 latency is 9 or 10 megahertz, and they run it sort of 1333, 1600, 1866.
[3564.62 → 3566.62] Those are kind of the DAC standards.
[3566.62 → 3568.62] And so DDR4 will be the same thing again.
[3568.62 → 3571.62] I, that actually took a really long time to talk about.
[3571.62 → 3573.62] It was kind of boring.
[3573.62 → 3574.62] Sorry for that.
[3574.62 → 3575.62] Memory.
[3575.62 → 3577.62] It's like hard to get excited about it.
[3579.62 → 3581.62] But I can.
[3583.62 → 3585.62] Uh, look at the new activation engine.
[3585.62 → 3586.62] Oh, you know what?
[3586.62 → 3587.62] Uh, activation, activation.
[3587.62 → 3588.62] Activision.
[3588.62 → 3589.62] Um, you know what?
[3589.62 → 3590.62] Why don't we check that out?
[3590.62 → 3594.62] So I'm gonna, I'm going to make you guys sit through, whoop, I'm showing you my whole live stream
[3594.62 → 3595.62] agenda.
[3595.62 → 3596.62] There you go.
[3596.62 → 3597.62] They can only see one small part of it.
[3597.62 → 3600.62] Yeah, they can see one small part of it that I may not actually end up talking about, so.
[3600.62 → 3601.62] Which would be kind of awesome.
[3601.62 → 3603.62] That, that is a good topic though.
[3603.62 → 3604.62] We should, we should definitely talk about it.
[3604.62 → 3605.62] Yeah.
[3605.62 → 3610.62] Um, so Activision is showing off some pretty freaking crazy stuff.
[3610.62 → 3615.62] And we had this actually posted in the Linus Tech Tips news section of the forum.
[3615.62 → 3623.62] So guys, remember by posting in the Linus Tech Tips news section of the forum, you can get, I'll mention on the live stream, which is worth one internet.
[3623.62 → 3630.62] So Chrome user posted the link to this YouTube video showing off some of the facial animations
[3630.62 → 3633.62] that are going to be, uh, that are coming out of the Activision lab.
[3633.62 → 3640.62] So I'm going to turn the volume down, and we're just going to like show you guys some of this crazy stuff that's going on here.
[3640.62 → 3643.62] Because it's just freaking crazy.
[3643.62 → 3644.62] Look at this guy.
[3644.62 → 3645.62] Like look at this guy.
[3645.62 → 3646.62] He looks like a guy.
[3646.62 → 3650.62] So they, uh, I think a little bit further on they have, yeah, there we go.
[3650.62 → 3651.62] There he goes.
[3651.62 → 3652.62] He smiles.
[3652.62 → 3655.62] You look at the wrinkles next to his eyes and like the brow furrowing.
[3655.62 → 3656.62] He's surprised.
[3656.62 → 3658.62] He has realistic facial expression.
[3658.62 → 3659.62] Okay.
[3659.62 → 3661.62] He's not quite realistic, but.
[3661.62 → 3662.62] It's pretty close.
[3662.62 → 3666.62] It's, it, it gets eerie sometimes because you can notice very small things are off.
[3666.62 → 3667.62] Yeah.
[3667.62 → 3670.62] But then sometimes like, it's pretty damn close.
[3670.62 → 3674.62] Like if he was moving fast, and I wasn't studying him knowing that he's CGI.
[3674.62 → 3680.62] That one right there when he kind of like pushes his upper lip up a little bit and goes, hmm, that one is pretty good.
[3680.62 → 3682.62] The eye, the eye movement I like.
[3682.62 → 3683.62] Yeah.
[3683.62 → 3684.62] Holy crap.
[3684.62 → 3688.62] That's, uh, that's actually kind of insane.
[3688.62 → 3691.62] That's nuts.
[3691.62 → 3692.62] Property of Activision Publishing.
[3692.62 → 3693.62] Yeah.
[3693.62 → 3695.62] We didn't make this just to be like super clear.
[3695.62 → 3697.62] So here's a little bit of a more tech demo.
[3697.62 → 3698.62] Guys do check this out.
[3698.62 → 3701.62] It's only got about a hundred and one thousand views.
[3701.62 → 3713.62] Guys, as gamers, we should be, you should, everyone should be so excited about this kind of technology because this is what it's going to take to move the realism of gaming forward.
[3713.62 → 3717.62] Um, this, uh, more physics interaction with environments.
[3717.62 → 3724.62] I mean, we, we've gotten to the point where it's not about like, remember when it used to be making the ball round?
[3724.62 → 3725.62] Yeah.
[3725.62 → 3726.62] Like that was the challenge.
[3726.62 → 3727.62] That was a huge thing.
[3727.62 → 3729.62] Like that was huge.
[3729.62 → 3735.62] Where like, you'd have like a bald dude and if you couldn't actually count the number of straight lines that it took.
[3735.62 → 3738.62] It was like, whoa, awesome.
[3738.62 → 3739.62] Yeah.
[3739.62 → 3745.62] Now it's like if you, if you can barely tell that the expression isn't 100% realistic.
[3745.62 → 3747.62] Do you remember what Cloud Strife's hair looked like?
[3747.62 → 3751.62] It's like you look at the concept art, and you're like, come on.
[3752.62 → 3754.62] That has nothing to do with it.
[3754.62 → 3756.62] It doesn't look like that.
[3756.62 → 3757.62] Like not at all.
[3757.62 → 3758.62] Yeah.
[3758.62 → 3759.62] And like Kate Sith.
[3759.62 → 3760.62] It's like, yeah, right.
[3760.62 → 3762.62] There's so much stuff.
[3762.62 → 3766.62] I used to be so confused actually when I was a kid, and I'd be researching a game that's coming up really soon.
[3766.62 → 3769.62] And I'd be like, this was the concept art?
[3769.62 → 3770.62] Yeah, I know, right?
[3770.62 → 3773.62] Like this is what, why do you even make concept art?
[3773.62 → 3774.62] Like it doesn't look anything similar.
[3774.62 → 3777.62] Now it's like, those are pretty much the same thing.
[3777.62 → 3779.62] This one actually looks worse because it was hand drawn.
[3779.62 → 3784.62] Like the manual for Final Fantasy 6 has portraits of all the characters in it.
[3784.62 → 3785.62] Yeah.
[3785.62 → 3787.62] And you're just like, lol.
[3787.62 → 3797.62] Because it's, it's, um, because, because, okay, there's the sprite, which looks like nothing besides like hair colour and like an outfit sort of.
[3797.62 → 3804.62] And then there's the character portrait within the menu, which looks nothing like the sprite and nothing like the portrait in the manual.
[3804.62 → 3806.62] And then there's the manual.
[3806.62 → 3810.62] Which is like, she's supposed to have pale, Tara's supposed to have pale skin.
[3810.62 → 3815.62] This is where suspension of disbelief met, like, it was so much more important though.
[3815.62 → 3818.62] In older, in more old school gaming it was so much more important.
[3818.62 → 3824.62] Now it's becoming like, you accept the world, like this is, uh, I'm going to misquote a few things here possibly, but.
[3824.62 → 3827.62] I should have some water.
[3827.62 → 3830.62] Um, there was some poet that came up with suspension of disbelief.
[3830.62 → 3836.62] Then there was J.R.R. Tolkien who came up with, uh, I can't remember what he actually called it, but it's where you like to believe.
[3836.62 → 3837.62] Probably something awesome.
[3837.62 → 3839.62] It's, yeah, it's probably sounded really cool, but I can't remember it.
[3839.62 → 3841.62] Um, it's where you completely believe in a separate world.
[3841.62 → 3851.62] So in J.R.R. Tolkien's, um, like, world that he created, if something happened that didn't make sense, like there's, there's, the laws of physics and everything don't apply to Lord of the Rings.
[3851.62 → 3852.62] Right.
[3852.62 → 3858.62] But there are laws in that world that if are broken, destroy your belief in that world.
[3858.62 → 3859.62] Right.
[3859.62 → 3860.62] So it's, it's not called suspension of disbelief.
[3860.62 → 3861.62] It's something that he coined.
[3861.62 → 3868.62] You know what I thought was probably one of the best examples of this until things got a little bit crazy at the end was Harry Potter.
[3868.62 → 3869.62] Yeah.
[3869.62 → 3873.62] Where there was a set of rules and there was, it was, it was very believable.
[3873.62 → 3880.62] Like as a, as a, you know, 10-year-old kid reading those books, you could be like, holy crap, is my letter from Hogwarts coming?
[3880.62 → 3886.62] And that's why a lot of people did start going like, oh, oh, I'm turning, I'm turning 11.
[3886.62 → 3887.62] Where's my letter to Hogwarts?
[3887.62 → 3888.62] Like all that kind of stuff happened.
[3888.62 → 3890.62] And you're right at the end, it got a little bit.
[3890.62 → 3891.62] At the end, it got a little bit.
[3891.62 → 3896.62] At the end, it's like, oh yeah, the rules of death don't apply to like Dumbledore and Harry for some frigging reasons.
[3896.62 → 3897.62] Like, okay.
[3897.62 → 3903.62] But up until then, you know, it obeyed some basic rules like.
[3903.62 → 3908.62] And still like there's, there's apparently lore that you can go into and figure out why that kind of stuff happens.
[3908.62 → 3909.62] But it's not the.
[3909.62 → 3911.62] But that looks like lore that was made up after the fact.
[3911.62 → 3913.62] It's not the automatic belief that comes in.
[3913.62 → 3914.62] Yes, ass covering lore.
[3914.62 → 3917.62] That's like, oh, oh, we created midichlorians.
[3917.62 → 3919.62] We better make an excuse for this.
[3919.62 → 3920.62] Like, oh snap.
[3922.62 → 3923.62] That's a perfect reference.
[3923.62 → 3927.62] There is so much crap in the original three movies.
[3927.62 → 3928.62] Oh, whoa.
[3928.62 → 3929.62] Yeah.
[3929.62 → 3930.62] Someone just brought up, we might want to stop talking.
[3930.62 → 3931.62] Spoilers.
[3931.62 → 3933.62] Although if you haven't seen Harry Potter, like come on man.
[3933.62 → 3934.62] Harry Potter?
[3934.62 → 3935.62] Really?
[3935.62 → 3939.62] After all those people were walking around with those shirts that go character X dies.
[3939.62 → 3941.62] On page whatever.
[3941.62 → 3942.62] Yeah, exactly.
[3942.62 → 3944.62] And like the people that walk through the malls with megaphone.
[3944.62 → 3946.62] Yeah, I'm not going to talk about spoiler alerts for Harry Potter.
[3946.62 → 3947.62] You know what?
[3947.62 → 3948.62] All the movies are out.
[3948.62 → 3949.62] All the books are out.
[3949.62 → 3950.62] If you haven't seen Harry Potter.
[3950.62 → 3952.62] I still care about spoiler alerts.
[3952.62 → 3953.62] Go pick up a book.
[3953.62 → 3954.62] I think we should try and be a little bit more there.
[3954.62 → 3955.62] Okay, okay.
[3955.62 → 3958.62] Are you really going to give me, are you going to talk spoiler alerts with like Star Wars?
[3958.62 → 3960.62] Can I talk about midichlorians?
[3960.62 → 3961.62] I liked that reference.
[3961.62 → 3962.62] It was a perfect reference.
[3962.62 → 3965.62] Can I talk about how Darth Vader dies at the end of like episode six?
[3965.62 → 3966.62] Like is that okay?
[3966.62 → 3967.62] Ugh.
[3967.62 → 3969.62] Can I talk about how he turns good?
[3969.62 → 3973.62] I wonder what the percentage is of viewers on our stream that have seen Star Wars.
[3973.62 → 3975.62] I wonder if it's the inverse of the female percentage.
[3975.62 → 3977.62] Okay, the guy's a freaking tragic hero.
[3977.62 → 3984.62] So if you didn't know that he was going to do a reversal at the end, then you haven't read any book ever.
[3984.62 → 3993.62] Seriously though, I wonder if the amount of viewers that have seen Star Wars is an inverse percentage of-
[3993.62 → 3994.62] I'm not having this conversation with you.
[3994.62 → 4007.62] Midichlorians are stupid and there's so much in the original three movies that just like would just prove that midichlorians never existed and no one ever knew anything about them.
[4007.62 → 4013.62] Like when Obi-Wan describes the Force, he's like it's an energy field that binds us and surrounds everything.
[4013.62 → 4016.62] It's not critters in your bloodstream.
[4016.62 → 4017.62] Are you kidding me?
[4017.62 → 4018.62] Oh man.
[4018.62 → 4021.62] Anyway, realistic video gaming.
[4021.62 → 4022.62] Good thing.
[4022.62 → 4023.62] We love it.
[4023.62 → 4026.62] We derail Twitter so hard.
[4026.62 → 4028.62] We were doing Twitter questions.
[4028.62 → 4029.62] Were we?
[4029.62 → 4030.62] Yeah.
[4030.62 → 4031.62] Okay.
[4031.62 → 4035.62] I don't want to spend too much time talking about this one because I've talked about it a lot,
[4035.62 → 4048.62] but AMD has showcased their Sky series of cards which are going to be competitors for NVIDIA's Grid which is basically cloud-based gaming, cloud-based rendering.
[4048.62 → 4060.62] So there's a server somewhere in LA or some kind of hub that does all the rendering and then it just-your smart TV might as well have some Bluetooth connected controllers of your choice,
[4060.62 → 4065.62] which that's going to be cool, having flexibility of controllers on your games.
[4065.62 → 4066.62] Yeah.
[4066.62 → 4069.62] Like it's like I don't like a six axis, but I want to play some PS3 exclusive titles.
[4069.62 → 4070.62] That's going to be awesome.
[4070.62 → 4072.62] Well here's the old, you know, ah screw you man.
[4072.62 → 4077.62] That's an actual thing because I grew up never playing PlayStation.
[4077.62 → 4079.62] I didn't have a PlayStation, none of my friends had PlayStation.
[4079.62 → 4080.62] We all had Nintendo or Xbox.
[4080.62 → 4081.62] Right.
[4081.62 → 4082.62] Once Xbox came out.
[4082.62 → 4085.62] Like before then we all had Nintendo and then Xbox came out, and we got an Xbox.
[4085.62 → 4086.62] We never went on the PlayStation side.
[4086.62 → 4088.62] I don't know why, it just kind of happened that way.
[4088.62 → 4093.62] So now if I try and go and play PlayStation I'm like, eh, what is this?
[4093.62 → 4100.62] And why should I have to buy a custom controller that suits my liking more when I could just have one controller that I use for actually everything?
[4100.62 → 4101.62] And that came into play.
[4101.62 → 4108.62] I've had to buy Mad Cat's controllers that I'm scared about breaking because they form factor to my hands better.
[4108.62 → 4111.62] Anyway, so I have no idea how to pronounce his name.
[4111.62 → 4112.62] A-T?
[4112.62 → 4113.62] I-T?
[4113.62 → 4114.62] A-T?
[4114.62 → 4115.62] Oh it's some like European thing.
[4115.62 → 4116.62] Ah, I-T.
[4116.62 → 4117.62] I-T?
[4117.62 → 4118.62] I-T?
[4118.62 → 4119.62] Okay.
[4119.62 → 4120.62] E-T.
[4120.62 → 4121.62] Phone home.
[4121.62 → 4125.62] He posted that in the Linus Tech Tips news section of the forum, so thank you for doing that.
[4125.62 → 4128.62] It's another Hexes link so yay Hexes.
[4128.62 → 4135.62] You guys are awesome, and apparently the link is not to the correct article though so that's a real shame.
[4135.62 → 4144.62] Okay, you get one half of an internet point deducted for having a bad link, but you'd still get half an internet point because I was able to find it.
[4144.62 → 4146.62] So Sky Series graphics cards, check that out.
[4146.62 → 4147.62] No fan.
[4147.62 → 4151.62] Because these are not intended to be installed in individual users' computers.
[4151.62 → 4158.62] So if there was ever any doubt to you guys that cloud based gaming is coming, both Nvidia and AMD are heavily invested in it now.
[4158.62 → 4159.62] It's coming.
[4159.62 → 4160.62] Uh, so.
[4160.62 → 4161.62] How soon?
[4161.62 → 4162.62] To what group of people?
[4162.62 → 4164.62] All that kind of stuff.
[4164.62 → 4165.62] Yeah, we don't know.
[4165.62 → 4169.62] So graphics core next, uh, frame grab, ICE, whatever all this stuff is.
[4169.62 → 4176.62] So they're talking pushing to notebooks, handhelds, desktops, I'm sure things like smart TVs, things like consoles, whatever else.
[4176.62 → 4179.62] AMD and Nvidia are going to be pushing this so hard.
[4179.62 → 4180.62] So there are three SKUs.
[4180.62 → 4185.62] There's one based on the same as the 7870, but it's got 40, 40 gigs, 4 gigs of RAM.
[4185.62 → 4193.62] There's one based on the 7970 which has, uh, 6 gigs of RAM and then there's one based on the 7990 which has 6 gigs total, 3 per GPU.
[4193.62 → 4195.62] So a lot of horsepower going on.
[4195.62 → 4198.62] And if I got any of those direct skew to skew comparisons wrong, I'm sorry.
[4198.62 → 4202.62] But it's based on the same graphics cores as those chips.
[4202.62 → 4210.62] Just to jump back for one quick second, uh, Tolkien's reference was secondary belief which is based on an inner consistency of, uh, inner,
[4210.62 → 4213.62] which is based on inner consistency and reality within that world.
[4213.62 → 4214.62] You know what?
[4214.62 → 4215.62] That was my problem with the Thomas Covenant books.
[4215.62 → 4216.62] Did you ever read those?
[4216.62 → 4217.62] I don't think so, no.
[4217.62 → 4219.62] Yeah, there's like nine of them.
[4219.62 → 4221.62] Um, I actually made it all the way through them.
[4221.62 → 4231.62] But it was one of those things where the issue was that things would get really bad and things were spiralling out of control to the point where they were almost, you know, breaking.
[4231.62 → 4233.62] And then something miraculous happened.
[4233.62 → 4234.62] Like every time.
[4234.62 → 4235.62] And it actually gets tiresome.
[4235.62 → 4236.62] Yeah.
[4236.62 → 4243.62] Because at some point you're just like, okay, they've been pushed to the brink and then to the brink again and then to the like, where is the brink?
[4243.62 → 4248.62] So you feel like the characters aren't ever in any real danger because the rules don't apply to them.
[4248.62 → 4259.62] Whereas if the rules apply, if Harry can actually die like a real person, and he doesn't just marry Ginny and have beautiful babies that go to Hogwarts, like, he should have died.
[4259.62 → 4260.62] Spoilers.
[4260.62 → 4262.62] I, he, come on.
[4262.62 → 4267.62] If you don't know Harry Potter lives, then like, shame on you.
[4267.62 → 4271.62] This is one of the reasons why, this is one of the reasons why I like the Wheel of Time series.
[4271.62 → 4272.62] Okay, I haven't.
[4272.62 → 4273.62] It makes sense.
[4273.62 → 4274.62] Harry should have died.
[4274.62 → 4279.62] I've had this conversation with you, but I haven't had this conversation on our live stream before.
[4279.62 → 4289.62] In order for the full impact, in order for him to be a proper sacrificial hero, he had to, he had to die.
[4289.62 → 4293.62] And I know that, you know, you can go, oh, well, Aslan didn't die.
[4293.62 → 4294.62] Aslan comes back to life.
[4294.62 → 4295.62] You know what?
[4295.62 → 4296.62] Screw Aslan.
[4296.62 → 4300.62] Because Harry was a Harry was a human.
[4300.62 → 4302.62] He was not a Jesus figure.
[4302.62 → 4304.62] He did not have to be resurrected.
[4304.62 → 4306.62] He should have died.
[4306.62 → 4311.62] Because it made, it made like everything he did much more real if he died.
[4311.62 → 4312.62] Yeah.
[4312.62 → 4313.62] And much more sacrificial.
[4313.62 → 4314.62] And the impact and the feel.
[4314.62 → 4315.62] What, you kill one of the twins?
[4315.62 → 4319.62] The impact and the feel and the climax and all that kind of stuff would have been way more impactful.
[4319.62 → 4320.62] Oh yeah.
[4320.62 → 4322.62] But, I, I hate the ending.
[4322.62 → 4323.62] I hate the ending.
[4323.62 → 4324.62] It's terrible.
[4324.62 → 4326.62] My least favourite part though is not the Harry Potter doesn't die part.
[4326.62 → 4328.62] I think she could have swung that.
[4328.62 → 4330.62] Like the, like the Matrix white room.
[4330.62 → 4331.62] Happy ever after.
[4331.62 → 4333.62] Like Dumbledore is still alive somewhere else.
[4333.62 → 4334.62] Come on.
[4334.62 → 4335.62] I know we.
[4335.62 → 4336.62] That's not even it though.
[4336.62 → 4337.62] It's, it's the happy ever after.
[4337.62 → 4338.62] Everything's better now.
[4338.62 → 4339.62] Oh.
[4339.62 → 4340.62] All of our kids are going to Hogwarts.
[4340.62 → 4343.62] Ron and Hermione are married, and their kids are the same age as that.
[4343.62 → 4346.62] I'm like, ah, ah, and everything lived happily ever after.
[4346.62 → 4347.62] I hated that.
[4347.62 → 4349.62] I thought she had the stones to not do it.
[4349.62 → 4350.62] Like to not, to not go down that path.
[4350.62 → 4351.62] Yeah.
[4351.62 → 4352.62] But, ah.
[4352.62 → 4354.62] It was just a little bit too cheesy.
[4354.62 → 4355.62] Yeah.
[4355.62 → 4356.62] It was kind of brutal.
[4356.62 → 4357.62] It's still great though.
[4357.62 → 4358.62] Like I love the books.
[4358.62 → 4359.62] I love the movies.
[4359.62 → 4360.62] Me too.
[4360.62 → 4361.62] Love the universe.
[4361.62 → 4366.62] Um, so we're going to do our last featured news item of the week.
[4366.62 → 4369.62] Oh, actually our last featured news item of the week was the Activision thing.
[4369.62 → 4370.62] Wait a minute.
[4370.62 → 4371.62] Oh no.
[4371.62 → 4372.62] That's it.
[4372.62 → 4373.62] That's it.
[4373.62 → 4374.62] Windows blue leaked and showcased.
[4374.62 → 4376.62] So like installable level leaked.
[4376.62 → 4377.62] Yeah, installable level leaked.
[4377.62 → 4379.62] You can install Windows blue.
[4379.62 → 4381.62] People were browsing our forum on Windows blue.
[4381.62 → 4382.62] Were they really?
[4382.62 → 4383.62] Yeah.
[4383.62 → 4384.62] That's cool.
[4384.62 → 4385.62] Yeah.
[4385.62 → 4389.62] So guys, if you don't know what Windows blue is, Windows blue is a new concept from Microsoft
[4389.62 → 4396.62] where they're moving away from the sort of monolithic releases of operating systems every
[4396.62 → 4397.62] two to three years.
[4397.62 → 4400.62] And well, you look at the XP cycle and that was a little bit on the long side.
[4400.62 → 4409.62] But, um, you know, you look back sort of at 95, 98, ME, we all like to forget, but 2000 XP
[4409.62 → 4410.62] was 2002.
[4410.62 → 4412.62] So they were on like a two-year cycle.
[4412.62 → 4419.62] Blue is going to be, I mean, maybe Apple wouldn't feel so high and mighty about their
[4419.62 → 4421.62] way of doing things if everyone didn't freaking copy them.
[4421.62 → 4422.62] Oh, that's a weird angle.
[4422.62 → 4425.62] How long has Apple been doing this?
[4425.62 → 4426.62] Years.
[4426.62 → 4427.62] Yeah.
[4427.62 → 4428.62] OS 10 leopard.
[4428.62 → 4429.62] OS 10 snow leopard.
[4429.62 → 4430.62] Slightly different sort of leopard.
[4430.62 → 4431.62] You're going to get so much flack for this.
[4431.62 → 4432.62] It doesn't matter.
[4432.62 → 4434.62] Saying that, saying that Apple should be butt hurt because people copy them when Apple copies
[4434.62 → 4435.62] everything else.
[4435.62 → 4436.62] No, no, no, no.
[4436.62 → 4437.62] What I said was like, that's where their attitude comes from.
[4437.62 → 4438.62] I don't like their attitude.
[4438.62 → 4439.62] I think it's a bad attitude.
[4439.62 → 4440.62] I think it's negative.
[4440.62 → 4441.62] I think it hurts the internet.
[4441.62 → 4442.62] I think it's negative.
[4442.62 → 4443.62] I think it's negative.
[4443.62 → 4444.62] I think it's negative.
[4444.62 → 4445.62] I think it's negative.
[4445.62 → 4446.62] I think it's negative.
[4446.62 → 4447.62] I think it's negative.
[4447.62 → 4448.62] I think it's not their attitude.
[4448.62 → 4449.62] I think it's not their attitude.
[4449.62 → 4450.62] I think it's not their attitude.
[4450.62 → 4451.62] They're unhappy because people copy them.
[4451.62 → 4452.62] No, no.
[4452.62 → 4454.62] Their attitude is we're the best because people copy us.
[4454.62 → 4456.62] So obviously that makes us the leader.
[4456.62 → 4457.62] Does that make everyone else that they copy the best?
[4457.62 → 4458.62] No, because that's not their attitude.
[4458.62 → 4459.62] I'm saying maybe that's where their attitude comes from.
[4459.62 → 4464.62] Major players, like Microsoft, have held out for years on, no, no, we're going to do
[4464.62 → 4479.62] large operating system releases, we're going to do them every couple of years, they're
[4479.62 → 4480.62] going to be $120.
[4480.62 → 4481.62] We won't sell you service packs.
[4481.62 → 4482.62] They're going to be $120.
[4482.62 → 4483.62] We won't sell you service packs.
[4483.62 → 4488.62] How many times have they said, they're not going to sell us service packs?
[4488.62 → 4489.62] They're copying Apple.
[4489.62 → 4490.62] They're doing Apple's approach.
[4490.62 → 4492.62] It's not called a service pack anymore, but come on.
[4492.62 → 4498.36] but like come on blue that's like Pokémon releases is that the route Microsoft's
[4498.36 → 4504.48] going to go down we're going to do like uh windows red if you could play Pokémon on like the installation
[4504.48 → 4510.58] screen windows gold it's like a very, very compact version of Pokémon where you should be able to
[4510.58 → 4517.02] beat the elite four before the thing's done windows gold colour windows gold advance windows
[4517.02 → 4525.66] gold MMO that's actually kind of hilarious windows releases like by Pokémon rule so it's actually the
[4525.66 → 4530.32] same operating system, but it comes with like a slightly different set of colour schemes
[4530.32 → 4537.32] the best was I think red and blue because it actually you could pick the starting Pokémon
[4537.32 → 4542.18] from the blue game in the red game it was just there was like a couple that were missing yeah i
[4542.18 → 4545.94] know, but it was I was like that's great because it would have been one thing to me if you had to pick
[4545.94 → 4551.32] a game and then that was just, but they're just like yeah no pick this game, but you can actually
[4551.32 → 4557.48] play the other game don't worry about it yeah um so anyway windows blue is more of an iterative
[4557.48 → 4562.76] release of windows, and apparently it's still very much up in the air internally whether they're
[4562.76 → 4566.96] going to how much they're going to charge for it how often these are going to come what changes
[4566.96 → 4575.26] exactly are going to be there but some of the highlights that are in there are on the other
[4575.26 → 4581.60] page of my notes here uh so they've done a lot of UI tweaks so things like modern UI formerly known
[4581.60 → 4587.88] as metro so the new Windows 8 UI now has uh it has more options for how you can size the windows
[4587.88 → 4593.86] you know what I'll let you did you have any of the like exceptional one is they're changing from I think
[4593.86 → 4598.08] it was 80 20 or 70 30, but you could have two applications on the screen but one of them was
[4598.08 → 4601.36] 70 or 80 percent and the other one was 20 or 30 percent I don't remember what the exact I think it
[4601.36 → 4606.02] was 80 20 maybe okay you can have like an I'm chat window here and then a browser and the browser that
[4606.02 → 4610.68] was the idea now they finally made it so that you can go 50 50 a lot of people were complaining about
[4610.68 → 4617.34] this I personally will often like uh Windows 7 and stuff you can yeah you can yeah you can just
[4617.34 → 4621.46] windows arrow keys throw stuff all over the place I do that all the time, and sometimes you need a little
[4621.46 → 4625.90] bit more sometimes they go 80 20, but often it's 50 50 I actually use the mouse port every time
[4625.90 → 4630.98] really yeah there's like there's awesome like repositories of windows hotkeys that are like
[4630.98 → 4635.28] holy crap I can do all these things with my keyboard I never remember them no I know I forget a lot of
[4635.28 → 4640.76] it but uh windows arrow keys are fantastic I do that all the time because it'll bounce and like if you
[4640.76 → 4645.00] have multiple monitors it'll lock to the sides of your multiple monitors' oh that's cool so you can
[4645.00 → 4650.82] like um automatically just go like if it's just if it's on the far right side of your screen and you
[4650.82 → 4654.58] have multiple monitors and the second monitors on the left you can just go windows tap tap
[4654.58 → 4658.90] on the left arrow, and it'll, I didn't even snap slowly all the way over and get all the way to
[4658.90 → 4664.18] left side um so other changes they're adding a better moviemaker I forget what it's called, but windows live
[4664.18 → 4669.86] moviemaker is going to get an uh an overhaul with a modern UI which is important not only because
[4669.86 → 4674.74] they're overhauling moviemaker which was due I mean it's its not as due as paint was when Windows 7
[4674.74 → 4681.46] came out, and they finally overhauled it um, but it's due for a makeover um and that means it's
[4681.46 → 4686.10] going to be usable presumably in a tablet yeah and now that you have x86 tablets that have like dual
[4686.10 → 4690.66] core i5 processors in them well you would be able to use that anyway you'll be able to take HD
[4690.66 → 4696.74] movies and actually edit them on your tablet yeah, but it wouldn't matter if it was in modern UI
[4697.46 → 4702.18] because if it's an x86 base you can still test it'll be easy to use true yeah, yeah like if it actually
[4702.18 → 4709.46] is usable with touch that's awesome yeah um you got anything else not specifically for blue better
[4709.46 → 4713.70] sky drive integrations coming uh consolidating things like settings to modern UI so basically
[4713.70 → 4719.62] they're making it um there because right now as a user of Windows 8 I find myself not actually using
[4719.62 → 4723.78] modern UI much at all no I find myself going back to the desktop where I know where things are and I know
[4723.78 → 4729.06] they're more easily accessible um, but they're trying to get that all consolidated back away to modern UI so
[4729.06 → 4733.30] that you don't have to leave it anymore because if you want people to get used to something it has
[4733.30 → 4736.98] to be a one-stop shop it has to be one-stop shop it has to be easy to get used to it how do you get
[4736.98 → 4741.70] used to shopping at Walmart everything's there you get in the habit you go there, and you're like oh where
[4741.70 → 4745.54] could I get that oh I saw it at Walmart last time I was there buying my groceries I saw that fishing
[4745.54 → 4751.30] tackle that I need, I didn't even realize Walmart had enormous stock of fishing supplies I was there
[4751.30 → 4756.90] today those are fish okay yes they have fish too so what you're saying I guess is don't bother catching a
[4756.90 → 4762.18] fish just buy a fish a lot of fishing enthusiasts out there it's kind of gross how often you can
[4762.18 → 4767.06] find dead fish in their fish department have you noticed that have you ever walked through it no
[4767.06 → 4770.90] yeah I don't like fish so I don't really shop for I wouldn't have it either but like there 's's
[4770.90 → 4776.90] pictures online of like entire tanks full of just dead fish it's like oh that's a sad that's no good
[4776.90 → 4782.90] um so anyway windows blue is coming if you guys want to check it out uh anyway the user who submitted
[4782.90 → 4788.74] oh I always lose track of which one I'm on oh my goodness uh the user who submitted this was a good
[4788.74 → 4795.86] bytes on the forum, so thank you good bytes for submitting that wow he has 628 posts top contributor
[4795.86 → 4801.78] so there you go, and he actually has a great summary of all the new that's cool all the new stuff that's
[4801.78 → 4809.06] coming so they've redone the calculator app oh yeah i.e. 11 uh i.e. 11 there you go lots of cool stuff and
[4809.06 → 4815.70] lots of it might change but uh but do check that out if you care uh you know what we should cover
[4815.70 → 4820.18] briefly Windows 8 turned out to be a more powerful gaming platform than Windows 7 that's something a
[4820.18 → 4824.42] lot of the viewers might care about if you guys haven't seen, yet we are still releasing and there
[4824.42 → 4828.10] are still going to be videos that we're developing later on that we haven't finished yet for testing
[4828.10 → 4833.06] and all this kind of stuff 8350 versus 3570k is a huge conversation we're trying to contribute as much
[4833.06 → 4838.18] as we can to it, we will be continuing to contribute to that conversation um videos that we've been
[4838.18 → 4843.14] releasing so far we just did Windows 8 versus Windows 7 we have not really on both platforms
[4843.14 → 4850.50] yes so four data sets we have not released the aa1 no just without antialiasing so we uh we have
[4850.50 → 4854.74] without antialiasing up, and we're going to be releasing with antialiasing uh one thing we found
[4854.74 → 4859.14] that was interesting is Windows 8 improves performance mainly minimums which are actually what you're going
[4859.14 → 4864.42] to notice most so that's really, really good yeah that makes a big difference it's just a matter of like
[4864.42 → 4868.82] I mean it comes into that conversation we were talking about with stuttering earlier yeah because
[4868.82 → 4875.38] a lot of the stuttering is not caused by the graphics card guys it's caused by OS it's caused by the game
[4875.38 → 4882.02] engine itself a lot of that lag is not their fault so if Microsoft is fine-tuning the OS to take better
[4882.02 → 4886.82] advantage of multicore and to schedule better and make sure the GPU is getting the resources it needs
[4886.82 → 4895.22] awesome yeah that's great and like um the difference between 60 and 55 fps compared to the difference
[4895.22 → 4902.02] between like 20 and 15 is kind of ridiculous a big difference so you will really notice the
[4902.02 → 4905.94] difference between 20 and 15, and you will only a little bit of notice the difference between 16 and 55
[4905.94 → 4911.94] and you'll notice a frame rate dip when you get to that car that explodes every time in that level yeah or
[4911.94 → 4918.34] when you get to that uh thing where all the guys rappel down from the ceiling and three guys bust into
[4918.34 → 4926.42] the door glass smashes and the glass smashes and that's where uh more like a smoother minimum fps is
[4926.42 → 4931.94] more important than that average frames per second so that was really cool I mean you had to fight
[4931.94 → 4937.38] with it a little bit to get the games to run it all had a lot of problems actually had to make sure all my
[4937.38 → 4943.62] drivers were nice and updated which I do anyway but still um had to install games for windows live
[4943.62 → 4947.38] which is confusing because when you go to download it, it's like oh I already have this program
[4948.58 → 4952.90] uh what, and then you download it anyway and install it, and it just installs like an advanced
[4952.90 → 4957.14] version of the program that you already have games for windows live is the worst thing ever I hate it
[4957.14 → 4962.58] if anyone from Microsoft is watching oh that was my biggest problem with batman trying to play batman was
[4962.58 → 4968.50] hard because windows live just stops you anyway um it's like the worst DRM I've ever run into yeah
[4968.50 → 4973.94] and the fact that it exists on games that are that you bought on steam is just painful like I don't
[4973.94 → 4980.26] mind steam as DRM I love steam so do i if Gabe's watching we love you man you are awesome come join us
[4980.26 → 4984.58] on the live stream yeah that'd be really cool that would be amazing can you imagine if we could get Gabe
[4984.58 → 4987.78] Newell on the live stream we probably just wouldn't talk even for like even for five seconds
[4987.78 → 4993.62] what would you pay out of your own pocket for a five-second cameo of game
[4993.62 → 4997.06] Newell on the live stream because what do you stupid amount because what do you okay what do you think
[4997.06 → 5002.02] his hourly salary is I'd give him my battle pose could we afford him for five seconds probably not
[5002.02 → 5006.10] I'd pay half of it I'd pay half of it we can barely afford to host our server for five seconds
[5006.10 → 5012.10] well the server's up right now that is um anyway we love Gabe Newell um so we love the way DRM is
[5012.10 → 5017.62] implemented in steam but when you stack something else on top of it like come on
[5018.50 → 5024.26] like that stupid crisis 2 things where my copy of crisis 2 just because I'm a benchmarked I change
[5024.26 → 5030.26] my hardware all the time so like oh you have this installed on tons of computers yeah yeah because
[5030.26 → 5036.26] I changed my graphics card tons of times so they just make my game stop working it's like come on man
[5036.90 → 5042.90] on the on in Ea's defence I did talk to them on the live chat, and they supported us and they actually
[5042.90 → 5046.98] were like okay well we'll give you a whole whack load more activations don't worry about it crazy amount
[5046.98 → 5051.70] I explained who i was like this is what I'm doing I'm going to have to call you guys every two
[5051.70 → 5057.46] weeks to get you to reactivate my game like oh okay so they dealt with it which is cool so pretty
[5057.46 → 5062.26] much just to save work for themselves yeah they dealt with it but still at least they dealt with
[5062.26 → 5065.22] it at least they dealt with it are you going to say the same thing about the sim city fiasco
[5066.42 → 5072.26] at least they dealt with it come on I dare, you say it no you can't say it can you okay, okay I think
[5072.26 → 5076.50] it's funny that they discounted stuff like crisis really really really hardcore because people
[5076.50 → 5081.22] buying it is not a problem people buying sim city is a problem so they're not discounting it at all
[5082.98 → 5088.26] anyway we'll, we'll try and leave Ea alone for the first time in three weeks yeah we beat them up a
[5088.26 → 5096.02] lot lately you know what I was at I was at my cousin's place today and uh they were playing uh NHL like
[5096.02 → 5102.42] 2012 or something stupid it's the same game as it's well okay a lot of people bring that up what
[5102.42 → 5109.78] are they supposed to do I don't know honestly it's hockey we've been playing we've been making hockey
[5109.78 → 5114.26] games since forever you've been making we've been making hockey games you and me humans have been
[5114.26 → 5119.86] making can you believe a Gila got traded oh you don't follow hockey I hate you no I love you but
[5119.86 → 5125.78] stop having lockouts and I'll freaking follow hockey no you won't, I will no you won't, I used
[5125.78 → 5130.66] to before the first okay well whatever do you know who Jerome again lives yes okay they traded him
[5130.66 → 5137.14] to Pittsburgh really yeah really yes he's played his entire career in Calgary I know, and he's traded to
[5137.14 → 5143.22] Pittsburgh that's actually like weird oh no it's bizarre Pittsburgh's been bulking up big time oh over
[5143.22 → 5146.66] the last couple of years they're going for they're going for the cup this year what the hell is Calgary
[5146.66 → 5154.02] doing oh well they give up as far as I can tell and guys Calgary you guys are my bros but uh yeah flames
[5154.02 → 5161.94] suck what was that guys yeah flames suck blue flames um back to some uh you know what
[5161.94 → 5166.58] okay we're done the bulk of the holy crap it's 10 30 yeah so let's do we're technically done the
[5166.58 → 5170.42] live stream yeah we're technically done the live stream, but we're going to do the after party uh for a
[5170.42 → 5173.78] little bit actually I have to upload some videos tonight and I'm like tired so I don't want to stay up
[5173.78 → 5180.26] too late but uh yeah I know I'm I'm such a wuss I'm sorry you guys, but we have to do our well we want to
[5180.26 → 5192.18] do our last giveaway for a WD my net n900 dual-band seven gigabit Ethernet port dual USB uh fast track
[5192.18 → 5198.02] plus automatic network prioritization make sure your games don't lag so you know when your sister's
[5198.02 → 5203.78] playing my little pony your sister is playing my little pony games online it doesn't slow down your
[5204.42 → 5208.90] League of Legends that you're actually playing we got a new build of the week as well probably oh yeah we
[5208.90 → 5211.62] can do that in the after party we'll do that first thing in the after party build of the week from
[5211.62 → 5217.46] the Linus tech tips' forum coming soon um wow record audience for the uh for the live stream thank you
[5217.46 → 5221.38] so much you guys everyone wants that router yeah everyone wants that route no everyone wants to look
[5221.38 → 5234.34] at your sexy mug yeah you're looking particularly sexy right now good news everyone yeah good news
[5234.34 → 5239.22] everyone we have a router to give away um all right so I've come up with a question that is not
[5239.22 → 5245.22] actually related directly to this fine piece of routing equipment but actually is related to western
[5245.22 → 5252.10] digital's storage products now one of the things that I advocate a lot and I'm bringing this I'm going
[5252.10 → 5259.94] to bring this full circle so it's somewhat related to networking is backups backup your freaking data it's
[5259.94 → 5264.66] important if you don't back up your data whether you're running a SSD in your system a hard drive
[5264.66 → 5270.42] in your system no matter what you're running in your system your storage can die it happens its life
[5270.98 → 5277.22] it just sometimes happens we've both worked like semi tech support level positions yes we have back up
[5277.22 → 5284.26] your data yeah back up your data like to come on please listen it's not that expensive any more so network
[5284.26 → 5290.50] attached storage I believe is the most elegant way to back up your data and there is a certain
[5290.50 → 5294.26] actually okay I'm probably giving too much too many hints at this point so anyway network attached
[5294.26 → 5298.34] storage is in a really important way to back up your data so you attach it to your network whether
[5298.34 → 5304.42] it's through USB to your router or whether it's in a dedicated network appliance such as a NAS
[5304.42 → 5309.54] network attached storage device and what a network attached storage device can do compared to
[5309.54 → 5314.10] something that you plug in directly to your computer is it can back up all the computers on your network
[5314.26 → 5317.94] a lot of them come with software applications where you can have it do it automatically you can
[5317.94 → 5323.70] take snapshots so you can restore those systems so if a hard drive physically dies or a SSD dies
[5323.70 → 5328.58] outright you just pull it out put in the new one that you got back from army restore an image and
[5328.58 → 5333.30] you're back up and running the same way where you were before you ended if not it's an expensive
[5333.30 → 5339.30] thousands of dollars even process to recover the data if it can be recovered at all so backing up your data
[5339.30 → 5344.58] is extremely important you can use a router like this to run a network cable to an as, and you can
[5344.58 → 5349.62] your data can be safe so I would like you guys to email me Linus tech tips at gmail.com with the subject
[5349.62 → 5355.22] this time I'm gonna let's do the subject line thing subject line question four okay go ahead fire that up
[5356.02 → 5364.74] what is the optimal hard drive from Western Digital for use in a NAS in a network attached storage device
[5364.74 → 5372.10] all right so what drives are you going to buy to go with this router right here to make sure that your
[5372.10 → 5376.10] data is going to be safe I'm going to give you guys some hints probably someone's answered it already
[5376.10 → 5383.38] anyway but hints for this particular line of drives is that they have enterprise grade features that prevent
[5383.38 → 5389.54] vibration from causing failures they use enterprise grade platters, although they run at a slightly lower
[5389.54 → 5398.10] speed can you not it's giving away all the hints I'm trying to give hints that's the best hint I know
[5398.10 → 5403.22] but that's not the point they've got a limited amount of time if they're still listening to your
[5403.22 → 5408.18] subpar hints they're not going to win they're going to get mine so you're just trying to so you're trying
[5408.18 → 5414.10] to win favour with the viewers by letting them win the contest yeah as opposed to just being charismatic like me
[5414.10 → 5426.42] and we're off-line and twitch doesn't want us on their website anymore and WD's never working with us again
[5429.06 → 5433.86] and intel's pretty displeased about that sponsorship deal that we are going to cut to a sponsor break
[5436.58 → 5442.10] this video is brought to you by our trusted partner intel for a limited time only with the purchase of any
[5442.10 → 5448.34] unlocked core i5 or core i7 intel CPU get a free intel beanie with a chance to win an intel snowboard
[5448.34 → 5453.06] valid for Canadian and U.S. customers only some restrictions apply for complete details visit
[5453.06 → 5454.66] intelgamingpromo.com
[5457.30 → 5463.46] all right guys so there that's our that's our last sponsored message for the night it is now 10 31 my
[5463.46 → 5471.22] time, and it is officially the after party so um let's do our rig of the week yeah yeah you've got
[5471.22 → 5476.74] it's in the dock it's in the dock right that's exactly where it is not the dock menu we don't
[5476.74 → 5481.94] use apple here this machine has like a billion pictures um so we're going to have to like hope oh
[5481.94 → 5487.70] crap I hope I'm logged in oh yeah guys pictures don't work on the Linus tech tips' forum unless you're
[5487.70 → 5493.86] logged in which is a way to uh which is a way to have our server not hate itself yeah when people flood a
[5493.86 → 5500.58] thread because as much good as it does us to uh to cache things in ram it's still will hate itself
[5500.58 → 5505.78] pretty hardcore if we do the wrong thing so uh, uh why don't why don't you explain what the rig of the
[5505.78 → 5511.30] week is while I figure out how to copy and paste this link it is in uh no, no explain like what this concept
[5511.30 → 5516.82] is what the concept is okay so we have a section number from called build logs um that is for you to
[5516.82 → 5522.34] go and while you're building your system, or after you've built your system or whatever um talk about
[5522.34 → 5528.98] the process of building your system um you're going to get on build of the week if you do awesome stuff like
[5528.98 → 5534.50] mods um if you make very nice clean looking builds or if you just make awesome builds in general
[5534.50 → 5539.94] something unique something that stands out um but the idea of the build log section
[5540.42 → 5546.02] is to just show the process of you building your computer some things that people do if it's subtle
[5546.02 → 5549.86] people won't necessarily notice it and if it's really awesome you want to throw it out there so
[5550.58 → 5554.42] jump on build logs take pictures while you're building your computer take pictures of awesome
[5554.42 → 5558.74] little components that you've hand done or whatever take just take pictures of the build process
[5558.74 → 5563.30] talk about the build process everyone goes on their tons of people comment everyone's really supportive
[5563.30 → 5568.98] and you know what the community is so friendly even if your system isn't something you know crazy and
[5568.98 → 5573.22] exceptional you know what you're still bound to be able to find someone who will talk to you about
[5573.22 → 5578.26] your rig and like you know tell you anything you could do to optimize it suggestions optimization
[5578.26 → 5583.78] suggestions look at that five 5600 posts in the build log section that's uh oh that's new builds and
[5583.78 → 5588.90] planning oh crap wrong one sorry up one uh yep I'm looking for build logs where is it jumping up one
[5592.26 → 5596.34] build logs there it is okay well I'm not showing it in the uh in the window there
[5598.58 → 5601.94] there we go I was trying to line it up with this stupid window here that's why I'm having trouble
[5602.50 → 5609.38] okay build logs show off your rig so 5300 posts in there and like to name your build yeah makes the title
[5609.38 → 5613.54] way cooler name your build take some good pictures like post the different process like
[5613.54 → 5616.98] post things that were hard post things that you did that you think are awesome have fun with it
[5616.98 → 5622.50] treat your gaming pc like a pc not a console yeah yeah I mean you could mod your console actually i
[5622.50 → 5628.18] guess yeah let's do it there's even water blocks for it oh yeah cool coolants uh was the first
[5628.18 → 5635.22] one I think to do an Xbox 360 block yeah and uh I'm having I'm having a Google Docs challenge here where
[5635.22 → 5640.34] um it doesn't it's not going to let me copy and paste that here one second
[5642.90 → 5649.14] I hate our forum sometimes hey actually I love it you know what slick has worked an unbelievable amount
[5649.14 → 5655.30] on I've got it cool has worked an unbelievable amount on making this forum uh just a great place and you
[5655.30 → 5662.18] know what he can't do it alone because it takes a really cool community to make a forum any different from
[5662.18 → 5667.78] any other forum and Mr wizard's just a beast and actually the whole mod team is uh is exceptional
[5668.34 → 5676.66] Mr wizard is my admin helper friend awesome person the if without him form wouldn't be up um wow look
[5676.66 → 5681.78] at that part list yeah but yeah we we love our forum staff you guys are amazing, and it wouldn't
[5681.78 → 5687.54] run at all without you picks of the backplate and oh my goodness he called it a SLI bridge cover okay
[5687.54 → 5691.62] minus one intranet but depending on how awesome this build is slick picked the rig of the week this
[5691.62 → 5697.14] week it's an and SLI bridge cover yeah but why would he have a radon logo there if he has a SLI bridge
[5698.26 → 5708.02] he doesn't why would he have a slid own there so that's rogue so he has radon graphics cards why
[5708.02 → 5714.10] would he have it he probably has a rogue board uh-huh, and he put a rogue cover on top of his SLI bridge
[5714.10 → 5719.54] what SLI bridge does he not have another graphics card he has three graphics oh I see what you're
[5719.54 → 5725.14] saying they run in crossfire jeez you're fired I thought you were trying to say it wasn't there
[5725.14 → 5729.22] you are so fired I thought you're trying to say it wasn't there you're so fired look at these sexy
[5729.22 → 5736.42] graphics cards wow that's that looks amazing so water-cooled graphics cards always kind of get me
[5736.42 → 5742.58] excited and uh i love these uh these short connections that people have started putting in
[5742.58 → 5748.10] them in the last sort of few years here where uh people are like basically hard uh hard piping them
[5748.10 → 5754.66] yeah looks amazing compared to I mean I used to do these tiny little gaps with tubing let me tell you
[5754.66 → 5761.38] that is not a lot of fun wow absolutely gorgeous I hope I've actually switched I'm so sad so that the
[5761.38 → 5767.14] live stream is looking I thought you just didn't see it no you're just hardcore now so sad so he called it
[5767.14 → 5770.74] he called it he called the vessel bridge anyway it looks perfect his crossfire bridge looks really
[5770.74 → 5779.54] good looks great there we go those fans look really course our SP fans look so good nice anti-vibration
[5781.78 → 5787.14] look at that hard pipe on the uh here check this out so the guy's hard piped most of it you know what i
[5787.14 → 5792.10] like this because even though it's in the middle of what would otherwise be a long run what he's done
[5792.10 → 5797.14] is he's gone for a visual look where he doesn't want any tubing that's longer than a couple inches
[5797.14 → 5803.54] or about five centimetres in length, and he wants uh comp like these compression fittings to break up
[5803.54 → 5808.58] that that look of that tubing giving it a very industrial feel to it, and it works really well it
[5808.58 → 5814.58] looks perfect yeah so he's got his ram water cooled his CPU water cooled he doesn't have his
[5814.58 → 5819.54] motherboard water cooled in spite of the fact that it's a Maximus 5 from the look of is that a Maximus 5
[5819.54 → 5824.26] I think so yeah I think so that's that's an odd one because that motherboard has built-in water
[5824.26 → 5830.10] cooling but what he probably did is he probably left it out because um it doesn't actually benefit
[5830.10 → 5834.10] the performance of the system in any meaningful way, and it would have broken his aesthetic a little
[5834.10 → 5840.34] bit because you can't replace the fittings on the Maximus 5 with uh with custom ones that's such a beast
[5840.34 → 5846.34] case oh my goodness and don't worry guys you don't have to have the most extreme rig in the world
[5846.34 → 5852.34] oh, but this guy does uh yeah to uh to be featured on build log of the week but if you do something
[5852.34 → 5856.74] sort of really, really cool and unique then we'd love to check it out and even if we don't feature
[5856.74 → 5864.98] it on the live stream of course there's uh oh wow I believe that's a case lab m8 pretty cool case mate
[5864.98 → 5873.70] ah look at those blocks I haven't seen these SPC blocks these must be relatively new either that
[5874.26 → 5879.38] or what he's done has he put no yeah okay these must be fairly new yeah yeah very nice lots
[5879.38 → 5885.62] of lots of great pictures of this look at those graphics cards holy smokes that looks good and that
[5885.62 → 5890.50] badge on the back goes really well I mean you know it's its one thing if people are like yeah I'm going to put
[5890.50 → 5896.42] branding all over my system yay I don't really necessarily go for that but when it's done tastefully
[5896.42 → 5903.54] then it can look very nice yeah it can look really sharp amazing looking rig and just uh an absolute
[5903.54 → 5909.46] inspiration to guys who want to feel proud of their gaming rig and uh and don't really know where to
[5909.46 → 5914.74] start I mean I love it when people do build logs showing the process because it makes it so you know
[5914.74 → 5921.06] the real people can aspire to do something like that they can see the actual process yeah it's
[5921.06 → 5925.54] awesome apparently those are called crystal link okay I mean that's what the internet's all about
[5925.54 → 5932.34] is sharing the process rather than you know proprietary knowledge yeah and I think build logs are just so
[5932.34 → 5937.22] much a part of that so guys um we love it when you post in the news section as well as the build log
[5937.22 → 5941.46] section of the Linus tech tips forum and if you haven't signed up for the forum already you've got two
[5941.46 → 5948.58] more days to sign up and post for the 3960x giveaway yeah that ends on the 31st and that's a big
[5948.58 → 5954.58] giveaway yeah so you there we have two 3960x extreme editions and the motherboards and two gigabyte x79
[5954.58 → 5959.78] motherboards to give away to two lucky winners yeah that's a big giveaway you're welcome
[5959.78 → 5964.74] um another thing not that I paid for them but I collaborated with intel to bring that you made it
[5964.74 → 5970.42] happen though that's true there was some confusion about the giveaway because a lady at the intel booth
[5970.42 → 5975.78] told Logan from tech syndicate I heard about that we had five CPUs to give away and I want to clarify
[5975.78 → 5983.46] that we had five CPUs that we advised intel what to do with we didn't actually get five we didn't get
[5983.46 → 5989.62] five we got two so there you go uh three of them went to we kind of said hey here are some other guys
[5989.62 → 5993.38] that you might want to allocate them to, and they can run their own things with them yeah so we don't
[5993.38 → 5998.10] we take no responsibility for what happened to those we have to we have to well we have two for
[5998.10 → 6002.50] this contest that we're giving away yeah we have lots of extreme editions they don't have yeah
[6004.50 → 6011.62] one two three diesels workstation has an extreme edition we did a tour of diesel's workstation
[6011.62 → 6017.14] in the video where we announced the contest uh so he's got like 32 gigs of ram oh it's just extreme
[6017.14 → 6022.42] edition squadron 4000 just like ridiculous computer he has a better computer than me so whatever man
[6022.42 → 6028.26] I think he actually do I think his video card is worth significantly more than mine yeah he has
[6028.26 → 6035.06] more ram than me um yeah that's kind of unfortunate yeah screw that guy i just
[6035.06 → 6041.62] crushed you not watching we love you diesel screw that guy that's mean that's not very nice
[6041.62 → 6046.82] okay you know what I'm not going to take that any further oh
[6050.50 → 6057.62] oh okay, okay continue uh my android experience so far oh yeah so I'm going to be filming hopefully
[6057.62 → 6066.34] this weekend um day five or six or whatever it is of my android uh I switched blog so i recently I was
[6066.34 → 6074.26] an iOS user for a few years and I have used android in the past so to be clear when I never said android
[6074.26 → 6080.90] I meant never android as long as it's the way it was when I used it yeah um so I used android back in
[6080.90 → 6088.66] the gingerbread era yeah um, and you know I've used android ice cream sandwich on tablets which is not the
[6088.66 → 6094.34] same experience is not the same experience and I still prefer my iPad to an android tablet and I have
[6094.34 → 6098.50] nice android tablets it's not about like oh you're using a crappy android tablet nope I have all the
[6098.50 → 6103.86] android tablets don't like them I mean all the end well I don't have all of them but I do have a tf700
[6103.86 → 6113.14] from Asus which is one of the nicer android tablets out there tiger 3 um so anyway HTC I wanted to try
[6113.14 → 6121.38] Windows phone 8. that was how this whole thing got started so HTC sent me a Windows phone 8 HTC 8x phone
[6121.38 → 6126.42] to try out and I went okay in exchange for you guys sending me this phone what I'll do is I'll
[6126.42 → 6132.82] blog my experience trying it for 30 days I will commit to take my sim out of my iPhone and not use
[6132.82 → 6138.26] it for 30 days so I used the 8x for 30 days ended up going back to iOS there were some complaints you
[6138.26 → 6145.06] guys can check it out if you YouTube search I switched with a little i big s switched uh to windows
[6145.06 → 6150.02] phone uh all the blogs are there, and it covers sort of some of the things that I felt like were problems
[6150.02 → 6154.10] turned out not being problems some of the things that I thought were problems that were problems
[6154.10 → 6159.94] I'm trying to document not what the most phone savvy guy thinks about this phone but what someone who
[6159.94 → 6165.38] actually hasn't touched a Windows phone ever might experience trying to switch to this platform so now
[6165.38 → 6169.14] I'm doing the same thing with android except I do have a little bit more android experience and quite
[6169.14 → 6173.86] frankly android is a lot more intuitive for an iOS user not that I'm going to say that google ripped
[6173.86 → 6181.14] off any of iOS's UI implementations actually iOS ripped off more android these days yes I mean early
[6181.14 → 6187.06] on it might have been the other way around yeah um, but the point is as someone who's used iOS a great
[6187.06 → 6192.90] deal using android is pretty darn intuitive I can say that much um I'm really enjoying the customizability
[6192.90 → 6199.30] of android in a big way like i I had you know what I think this probably summarizes my experience best so
[6199.30 → 6206.42] far I had an issue with HTC sense 5.0 where pulling down from the top menu didn't have quick toggles
[6206.42 → 6210.42] for things like auto rotate I had to go deep within the settings to enable and disable that
[6211.14 → 6216.66] and didn't have quick toggles for Bluetooth Wi-Fi all that kind of stuff and I went oh okay how do I fix
[6216.66 → 6223.30] this okay there's some app with 500 000 downloads that I can install, and it'll do that so great I can
[6223.30 → 6229.14] customize android and then sort of summary point number two is not all the toggles work on my phone
[6229.14 → 6238.74] that happens and that is the advantage and disadvantage of android in a nutshell basically
[6238.74 → 6244.02] yeah it's actually pretty okay, but the point is also that android makes up for it in sheer breadth
[6244.02 → 6247.46] if you rooted your phone would those work do you know what the problem is I don't know what the
[6247.46 → 6252.58] problem is I have no idea but what I suspect is that if I found some other switching app of which
[6252.58 → 6256.90] there are many I could find one that'll work with my phone this is also pre-release hardware
[6256.90 → 6260.98] running pre-release software yeah so I'm not going to run out and blame android and I'm not going to
[6260.98 → 6265.78] run out and blame the app dev yet and yeah another thing is there are often a lot of ways to fix it
[6265.78 → 6273.22] sometimes there isn't blah blah blah so uh my wife's phone the droid DNA I couldn't get uh cellular data
[6273.22 → 6280.90] working here in Canada bell wanted some kind of stupid fee to help us isn't that because it was from
[6280.90 → 6286.10] somewhere else it's a Verizon specific phone but I'm not convinced there's because it worked for
[6286.10 → 6293.78] calls so I think it was just a setting and bell was just sort of yanking me around um, but they wanted
[6293.78 → 6298.26] a fee in order to unlock that phone to use on their network but what ended up happening was all I had to
[6298.26 → 6303.46] do was root the phone install a custom room which was about a six-hour process because the droid DNA is
[6303.46 → 6311.38] not simple to root and like the wire the antenna sort of chipset upgrade uh root option if you
[6311.38 → 6315.54] haven't used the over the air update blah blah blah all these things came out the day that I was
[6315.54 → 6321.22] rooting it and putting my custom room on it so I was like yeah before that there was nothing and if
[6321.22 → 6324.66] you applied the over the air update there's nothing you could do last time I checked which is about
[6324.66 → 6330.58] a week ago but um I rooted it, and now it works 100 except MMS messages still don't work, but that's
[6330.58 → 6334.98] probably just a matter of drinking around with it yeah, but there's probably a way to make it work
[6334.98 → 6342.10] that's what I like about android I never did jailbreak my iPhone so I should be careful to condemn
[6342.10 → 6345.94] it because if I'm going to run around and say oh well android is customizable because I can root the phone
[6347.62 → 6355.06] you know what iOS can be up can be customizable if you jailbreak the device as well so um okay let's
[6355.06 → 6359.86] talk about whatever you wanted to talk about I think you had a thing should we show them our
[6359.86 → 6364.66] awesome video if they haven't seen it yeah yeah I'm down for that yeah let's show them our awesome
[6364.66 → 6368.58] video that not everyone has necessarily seen you know what we can talk about the tech quickie channel
[6368.58 → 6375.30] in general, so my main channel is Linus tech tips on YouTube but I have a couple of other channels Linus
[6375.30 → 6380.82] cat tips is just stupid videos of my cats you know including the most recent one I'm yeah where he's
[6380.82 → 6386.42] just licking his own troll yeah oh my goodness the title of the video is just lol you know what the
[6386.42 → 6390.50] probably one of the funniest comments I've ever seen on one of my YouTube videos, and we're talking
[6390.50 → 6395.70] hundreds of thousands of comments some guy posted on the video it's a seven-second clip of my cat
[6395.70 → 6402.18] licking his bum and the guy's like you have no idea how difficult this was to explain to my mom
[6402.18 → 6419.94] why are you watching a video on the internet of a cat licking a hole he's like yeah I got nothing here
[6419.94 → 6427.86] I got nothing that's awesome absolutely nothing um so anyway my last channel is tech quickie so uh we're
[6427.86 → 6432.98] gonna head over there right now and tech quickie is meant uh so Linus tech tips we do reviews we do
[6432.98 → 6438.82] unboxing it's more like editorial style where we'll, we give a lot more opinion whereas tech quickie is
[6438.82 → 6444.18] intended more for like videos that we produce for companies because there's honestly not that many
[6444.18 → 6452.26] guys out there who are it tech video guys nope I mean there's Eric there's Paul there's tiny tom Logan
[6452.26 → 6459.38] there's Logan the other Logan from tech syndicate um there's uh oh crap uh what's that British
[6459.38 → 6465.38] troubadar yeah um i I apologize for anyone I'm missing, but those are most of the
[6465.38 → 6476.10] major guys um and of course tastypc.tv um, but there's not that many guys who are into the tech of
[6476.10 → 6484.42] motherboards or like gaming mice enough to really make a video that is going to address the
[6485.22 → 6490.02] the good things about the product in a meaningful way, so tech quickie is meant as a channel where we
[6490.02 → 6497.30] can do that for manufacturers without destroying the the the credibility of our real channel which is
[6497.30 → 6504.66] Linus tech tips because this is like sponsored content yes like steel series asked us to make this
[6504.66 → 6510.18] Linus tech tips will have sponsored pre-rolls and then what's in the video has nothing to do with
[6510.18 → 6516.34] that at all that's our content this is someone else's content and I'm the host pretty much yeah um but
[6516.34 → 6521.94] we did one that we were really, really proud of, and we're going to have you guys watch oh no way we want
[6521.94 → 6526.90] as many people to watch this as possible, so this is not actually the final version of the video
[6526.90 → 6533.14] we created for the corsair vengeance 2000 headset this was uh this one was not approved by corsair but we
[6533.14 → 6537.22] released it anyway because we really like it so yeah we're going to go ahead and play this for you, it's
[6537.22 → 6541.62] only about a minute and a half long corsair added Dolby headphone surround sound to the vengeance 2000
[6544.34 → 6554.66] it's time for some gaming
[6563.14 → 6566.74] so
[6577.14 → 6590.02] so
[6590.02 → 6594.78] I'm so tired.
[6595.50 → 6597.56] These headphones are so light and comfortable.
[6597.98 → 6599.78] Just could almost...
[6603.72 → 6608.52] Oh, I was asleep for so long.
[6609.26 → 6611.20] Even the 10-hour battery is dead.
[6612.12 → 6612.78] It's okay, though.
[6613.54 → 6614.42] I'll just play it in.
[6615.92 → 6616.94] Keep going.
[6620.02 → 6623.58] Maybe you think you don't need accurate positional audio,
[6623.72 → 6626.16] but how else will you know where threats are coming from?
[6626.54 → 6627.10] Hot potato!
[6627.72 → 6628.64] You won't.
[6629.12 → 6630.72] Thanks for checking out this tech quickie.
[6631.86 → 6634.92] On the Vengeance 2000, I'll see you back again next time.
[6639.06 → 6643.46] It's awesome because we actually had at least one or two people comment,
[6643.56 → 6644.08] Welcome to Tech quick.
[6644.08 → 6645.46] Where does the pin for the grenade episode?
[6645.82 → 6647.46] It's all about the Samsung...
[6647.46 → 6647.98] Go away, go away.
[6647.98 → 6650.26] Where does the pin for the grenade go?
[6650.32 → 6652.36] Because I just pull the pin out with my mouth,
[6652.44 → 6653.98] and then it's just...
[6654.94 → 6656.68] Do I eat it?
[6657.38 → 6661.18] And why did Slick throw a grenade at me that still had the pin in it?
[6662.58 → 6665.40] It's like the world's most handicapped soldier.
[6666.48 → 6668.60] You can't remove the pin from that grenade.
[6668.86 → 6669.94] It's not actually possible.
[6670.02 → 6671.32] Yeah, it's not actually a grenade.
[6671.32 → 6674.68] It's actually MSI swag that has a little pull cord on it,
[6674.68 → 6675.68] and then you let it go in it.
[6675.68 → 6675.96] It goes...
[6675.96 → 6678.26] So it's like a vibrator grenade?
[6679.30 → 6679.96] Oh, wow.
[6680.26 → 6680.54] Okay.
[6680.88 → 6682.58] We're not going to make YouTube videos anymore.
[6682.96 → 6685.18] We are going to manufacture vibrating grenades.
[6686.10 → 6688.18] And what people do with them is not actually our problem.
[6690.06 → 6693.02] Anyway, we had a lot of fun making that video.
[6693.14 → 6693.42] Oh, man.
[6694.00 → 6695.26] Okay, we sort of had fun.
[6695.32 → 6696.86] How many times did you climb up onto that fence?
[6696.86 → 6699.66] My legs legitimately were like in pain.
[6699.86 → 6703.56] Going up and down stairs after that video was actually like...
[6703.56 → 6704.14] You saw me.
[6704.22 → 6704.76] Oh, I saw you.
[6705.14 → 6706.12] That hurt.
[6706.16 → 6706.80] I didn't want to look.
[6706.82 → 6708.14] It was sort of painful to watch, actually.
[6708.14 → 6709.54] It was...
[6709.54 → 6710.90] I mean, it's a six-foot fence.
[6711.16 → 6712.88] And then with a little bit of a drop after it.
[6712.88 → 6714.06] Yeah, with a little bit of a drop.
[6714.06 → 6716.02] And you had to like kind of jump forward.
[6716.56 → 6717.60] And you had to hold this sword.
[6718.46 → 6719.26] Which is like...
[6719.26 → 6720.60] It's not a play sword.
[6720.76 → 6721.24] It's sharp.
[6721.24 → 6722.06] And it was in the rain.
[6722.34 → 6723.94] So I'm like half slipping most of the time.
[6724.04 → 6725.74] So even balancing up there was difficult.
[6725.98 → 6727.38] I fell off that fence the other day.
[6727.86 → 6728.68] It's slippery.
[6729.06 → 6730.50] No, this was in like sunlight.
[6731.02 → 6731.18] Yeah.
[6731.40 → 6731.86] I was...
[6731.86 → 6737.48] Yvonne wanted some branches from one of the trees up there for her sister's wedding.
[6737.94 → 6740.30] And apparently I have to go up there and cut them off.
[6740.30 → 6744.04] So I legit fell off the ladder.
[6744.48 → 6747.68] And then landed with my hands on the fence.
[6747.68 → 6751.24] And so you know how those hedges are there, right?
[6751.24 → 6751.40] Yeah.
[6751.40 → 6752.78] So I had the ladder leaning up like this.
[6752.80 → 6753.68] And I fell off the ladder.
[6753.90 → 6756.34] So I'm horizontal by the time my hands hit the fence.
[6756.62 → 6759.62] If I hadn't hit the fence, I would have hit the ground.
[6760.04 → 6760.40] Yikes.
[6760.42 → 6761.90] From like six, eight feet up.
[6762.10 → 6762.86] And like that's...
[6762.86 → 6763.44] That would have been painful.
[6763.46 → 6764.32] Kind of big deal.
[6764.74 → 6765.06] Anyway.
[6765.62 → 6766.18] But anyway.
[6766.62 → 6767.34] Slick had to climb...
[6767.34 → 6768.46] How many times did you climb up?
[6768.60 → 6769.20] Quite a few, actually.
[6769.20 → 6770.10] I think it was at least ten.
[6770.40 → 6770.64] Yeah.
[6770.76 → 6774.40] And the day before I had played like three hours of laser tag.
[6774.48 → 6775.68] Where I was sprinting the entire time.
[6775.74 → 6777.18] Even though they're like, no running.
[6777.18 → 6777.82] Yeah, whatever.
[6777.84 → 6779.16] No one walks in laser tag.
[6779.16 → 6780.32] Who walks in laser tag?
[6780.40 → 6783.42] Anyone who walks in laser tag, you can just tune out of the live stream now.
[6783.50 → 6784.46] And you just lost.
[6784.62 → 6785.56] Yeah, you just lost.
[6785.64 → 6786.14] Good job.
[6786.30 → 6786.62] Anyway.
[6786.94 → 6790.18] That said, anyone who takes laser tag seriously is kind of...
[6790.18 → 6790.60] That's another problem.
[6791.10 → 6795.80] It's designed for kids, and I'm so big that hiding behind the walls was actually like a problem.
[6796.08 → 6797.40] Did you manage to put the vest on?
[6797.82 → 6799.16] Yeah, but it was like here.
[6800.24 → 6803.18] It's like a midriff showing like vest.
[6803.18 → 6805.10] I had to hide behind the walls.
[6805.20 → 6809.30] So I'm like, instead of just like crouching behind a wall, I have to like to slit, sit and
[6809.30 → 6810.70] slouch behind the wall.
[6810.92 → 6813.74] So I'm like blocking the entire walkway.
[6815.74 → 6816.46] That's horrible.
[6816.52 → 6816.70] Whatever.
[6816.82 → 6817.66] Real men play paintball.
[6817.82 → 6818.32] So there you go.
[6818.32 → 6818.80] I play paintball.
[6819.20 → 6819.32] Yeah.
[6819.32 → 6822.52] It was like 10 bucks for like three hours.
[6822.70 → 6823.54] You know what drives me crazy?
[6824.20 → 6827.06] Guys who like armour up to play paintball.
[6827.56 → 6828.08] Oh, whatever.
[6828.30 → 6829.96] So you have to wear a mask.
[6830.10 → 6830.30] Yep.
[6830.48 → 6831.32] Wear a mask.
[6831.46 → 6832.06] Wear a freaking mask.
[6832.06 → 6832.74] Wear gloves.
[6832.94 → 6833.18] Yep.
[6833.44 → 6833.94] Wear gloves.
[6834.10 → 6834.52] Important.
[6834.74 → 6835.14] You know what?
[6835.22 → 6837.24] Even wear a jog because...
[6837.24 → 6838.04] Yeah, that could hurt.
[6838.08 → 6840.30] I've heard stories that are just not good.
[6840.42 → 6840.58] Yeah.
[6840.58 → 6844.58] But like guys who like wear armour...
[6845.54 → 6846.26] That's kind of nuts.
[6846.38 → 6846.78] Okay.
[6846.88 → 6848.44] So two reasons people wear armour.
[6848.54 → 6849.88] Number one is they fear the pain.
[6850.34 → 6851.28] And I'm just like, come on.
[6851.44 → 6853.42] I always played t-shirt and shorts.
[6854.00 → 6854.38] Always.
[6854.76 → 6856.98] Because real men play paintball with t-shirt and shorts.
[6857.56 → 6860.58] And the other reason people wear armour is to make the balls...
[6861.10 → 6864.42] Like they'll wear armour with padding so that the balls are less likely to break.
[6864.68 → 6865.22] Oh, that's lame.
[6865.22 → 6866.08] And I'm just like, come on.
[6866.28 → 6871.12] The idea of a gun with a bullet is that the guy on the other end got hit.
[6871.46 → 6871.74] Yeah.
[6871.92 → 6872.64] That's lame.
[6872.72 → 6873.28] That's lame.
[6873.42 → 6874.50] People do it all the time.
[6874.58 → 6875.60] It drives me crazy.
[6875.86 → 6877.00] I wear...
[6877.00 → 6879.90] See, I didn't play nearly as much as you did.
[6879.98 → 6882.84] I would just play with like sports teams and stuff that would have an event that brought
[6882.84 → 6884.18] us to a paintball field.
[6884.52 → 6884.94] That's all I really...
[6884.94 → 6886.26] And like bachelor parties or whatever.
[6886.38 → 6887.60] Like that's when I play paintball.
[6887.74 → 6889.34] I've never been invited to a bachelor party.
[6889.80 → 6891.10] I actually have no friends.
[6892.68 → 6895.02] When you get married, will you invite me to your bachelor party?
[6896.02 → 6896.40] Yes.
[6896.52 → 6896.74] Okay.
[6897.10 → 6899.66] Is that putting you in an awkward position because I'm your boss?
[6899.82 → 6900.04] Yep.
[6900.96 → 6902.18] I'll do it anyway.
[6902.86 → 6903.26] Yes.
[6904.16 → 6905.52] Um, what was I going to say?
[6905.70 → 6905.86] Yeah.
[6905.94 → 6908.86] So I would wear the like overalls that they give you because I never...
[6908.86 → 6911.54] I didn't have clothes that would be like, I play paintball in these clothes.
[6911.70 → 6911.98] Oh yeah.
[6912.04 → 6912.32] No, no.
[6912.38 → 6913.20] I did though.
[6913.40 → 6913.60] Yeah.
[6913.74 → 6914.66] So like that's why...
[6914.66 → 6915.98] But I wouldn't wear armour.
[6916.08 → 6917.66] I would just wear the overalls that they gave me.
[6917.84 → 6918.04] Yeah.
[6918.50 → 6919.56] Because it's just like...
[6919.56 → 6920.16] I mean...
[6920.16 → 6923.26] And like guys will wear like three sweaters under the overalls.
[6923.26 → 6924.52] So same thing for the padding.
[6924.52 → 6925.32] And I'm just like...
[6925.32 → 6926.30] I just wear a t-shirt and...
[6926.30 → 6926.42] Yeah.
[6926.48 → 6928.86] Usually actually a t-shirt and shorts because I didn't want to get too hot in the overalls.
[6928.86 → 6934.14] It's not violating the, um, the letter of the law, but it's violating the spirit of
[6934.14 → 6934.48] the law.
[6934.66 → 6934.80] Yeah.
[6934.84 → 6937.48] Which is that if you hit the guy, he should die.
[6937.84 → 6938.04] Yeah.
[6938.16 → 6938.64] In theory.
[6938.90 → 6939.88] I'm like, you should feel it.
[6939.96 → 6940.98] That was my whole thing.
[6941.20 → 6945.08] It's like, I want to play paintball and if I get hit, I want it to go like chunk.
[6945.26 → 6946.54] I want the rush.
[6946.72 → 6947.10] I'm out.
[6947.16 → 6947.58] Yeah, exactly.
[6947.58 → 6949.98] The actual fear of actually getting hit by somebody.
[6949.98 → 6952.10] I want to really not want to get hit.
[6952.50 → 6952.94] So that...
[6952.94 → 6953.70] It's more fun that way.
[6953.92 → 6954.28] Exactly.
[6954.52 → 6955.14] It's actually more fun.
[6955.14 → 6957.14] Because then you're way more tactical, and you care way more.
[6957.34 → 6957.54] Yes.
[6958.50 → 6962.04] And it's like that much more awesome when you like suicide run someone.
[6962.46 → 6962.86] 100%.
[6962.86 → 6964.48] Because you're like, oh my god.
[6964.52 → 6966.02] I actually had it work once.
[6966.40 → 6967.26] We cleared a bunker.
[6967.64 → 6970.24] Uh, there were probably about seven guys inside.
[6970.92 → 6976.94] And I just like slid in and managed to take out about four of them before it was over.
[6977.06 → 6977.64] That's actually pretty awesome.
[6977.64 → 6981.90] And in the commotion, three more of my guys were able to come in and take the bunker.
[6982.22 → 6982.50] Nice.
[6982.60 → 6985.42] And that was, it was like a flag bunker and blah, blah, blah.
[6985.46 → 6986.36] We ended up winning the match.
[6986.36 → 6989.18] So I was like, I got plastered.
[6989.56 → 6991.74] Not drunk plastered, but paint plastered.
[6991.74 → 6993.70] But like completely, you're basically a part of the floor at this point.
[6993.70 → 6994.88] I got destroyed.
[6995.64 → 6996.94] But it was so worth it.
[6996.94 → 6997.74] But it's so worth it, yeah.
[6997.74 → 6997.86] It was so awesome.
[6998.42 → 7003.94] And it's like, it's like the, the, the battle scar is worth so much more if there was like
[7003.94 → 7004.80] a battle.
[7005.56 → 7005.80] Yeah.
[7006.34 → 7006.98] And you have a scar.
[7007.72 → 7010.58] Linus played at a way ridiculously higher level than I played.
[7010.62 → 7011.50] Well, I still played casual.
[7011.58 → 7012.36] I never played competitive.
[7012.80 → 7013.24] Right, yeah.
[7013.32 → 7015.54] But it's still like, you owned your own gun.
[7015.80 → 7016.08] Okay.
[7016.08 → 7018.16] I would go like once every year or two, maybe.
[7018.16 → 7018.54] Right, okay.
[7018.66 → 7020.16] And still it's kind of at that level.
[7020.54 → 7026.90] My best story is my brother and I were playing at a bachelor party, and he could see, he could
[7026.90 → 7030.04] kind of get out and shoot people, but was in a fairly vulnerable position.
[7030.50 → 7034.34] I was kind of too far away to shoot people, but could see better.
[7034.34 → 7038.10] So I would shout targets to him, and he'd lean around the corner and pick him out and then lean
[7038.10 → 7038.42] back.
[7038.80 → 7040.08] And that was, that was cool.
[7040.14 → 7040.80] That's legit awesome.
[7040.80 → 7043.98] When you've got someone that you can teamwork with that well, because you like to know each
[7043.98 → 7045.68] other really well, and you're in perfect situations.
[7045.68 → 7047.28] It's just really cool.
[7047.36 → 7048.22] So that was my best.
[7048.22 → 7050.60] I have no friends, so I always went to the field by myself.
[7051.02 → 7054.54] Man, this is like the most forever alone live stream ever.
[7055.08 → 7058.98] Sometimes I'd run into people who are like, you know, also forever alone.
[7059.18 → 7060.06] So we'd team up.
[7060.18 → 7060.52] Oh, okay.
[7060.52 → 7065.82] And we'd like, every once in a while, someone else who knew what they were doing would show
[7065.82 → 7067.12] up without a big group.
[7067.38 → 7071.34] So we'd like, we'd, we'd tandem hunt, and it was just a ton of fun.
[7071.46 → 7071.62] Yeah.
[7071.72 → 7072.32] It's a ton of fun.
[7072.40 → 7074.78] It's really cool to be able to like collaborate and team up with people.
[7076.00 → 7078.02] Um, so let's talk about Red Bull.
[7078.68 → 7082.44] Why do we get so upset that electronics cost so much?
[7082.86 → 7083.22] Okay.
[7083.24 → 7087.98] I think, um, stuff like RAM, there's a few, I see this on the forum a lot.
[7088.04 → 7089.08] RAM prices are going up.
[7089.08 → 7089.34] Yeah.
[7089.34 → 7090.32] Um, so what?
[7090.42 → 7092.22] Do you know how much money they lost last year?
[7092.96 → 7094.66] Everyone making RAM is losing money.
[7094.86 → 7094.96] Yeah.
[7094.98 → 7096.58] And like, RAM is cheap.
[7096.82 → 7098.64] Stuff like a whole system.
[7098.92 → 7102.46] If you're buying a laptop, and you're complaining that it's expensive, I understand because it's
[7102.46 → 7103.08] a big investment.
[7103.36 → 7105.80] Red Bull you don't really care about because it's three bucks or two bucks or whatever.
[7105.90 → 7111.74] But the problem is that that whole system actually probably, okay, top of the supply chain
[7111.74 → 7113.62] to the bottom of the supply chain.
[7113.62 → 7122.52] If you buy a commodity level system like a $500 desktop, there was maybe, maybe, including
[7122.52 → 7124.72] software, like a hundred bucks.
[7124.98 → 7126.54] Even that's probably optimistic.
[7126.54 → 7127.78] That's pretty optimistic.
[7127.96 → 7131.58] There was maybe like 75 bucks of actual profit.
[7131.58 → 7132.08] Like they don't make a lot of money.
[7132.14 → 7139.02] And that includes the actual factory that built the stupid thing, the engineering company that
[7139.02 → 7139.64] designed it.
[7139.72 → 7140.60] Sometimes they're separate.
[7140.70 → 7141.60] Sometimes they're the same.
[7141.60 → 7145.28] So someone like Dell doesn't necessarily have a motherboard factory.
[7145.38 → 7148.60] They're going to outsource to Foxconn or whoever else, but they design their own boards.
[7148.70 → 7150.08] They actually have engineering staff.
[7150.42 → 7150.64] Okay.
[7150.80 → 7156.46] So there's the designer, the manufacturer, the retailer that you bought your Alienware laptop
[7156.46 → 7156.86] at.
[7156.96 → 7157.96] They're taking a cut.
[7159.04 → 7161.98] And there's probably a distribution middleman somewhere in there.
[7162.20 → 7166.12] There are couriers that are carting the parts and the finished thing around.
[7166.12 → 7172.48] There were maybe 75 bucks of profit in the entire enterprise on like a $500 commodity notebook
[7172.48 → 7172.96] or desktop.
[7173.16 → 7173.72] It's pretty brutal.
[7174.36 → 7180.34] And this is from someone who actually was in there and actually knows there is not a
[7180.34 → 7180.88] lot of money in it.
[7180.92 → 7185.90] So while, I mean, I like working at NCI for so many years, I'd see a lot of people making
[7185.90 → 7188.92] remarks like, oh, NCI is so baller.
[7189.00 → 7190.82] They charge $700 for a video card.
[7191.10 → 7193.64] Yeah, I charged $700 for, you know, how much profit there was in it?
[7193.74 → 7194.32] Not a lot.
[7195.32 → 7196.10] Five bucks?
[7196.12 → 7199.42] Let me tell you, double digits and not deep into them.
[7199.54 → 7201.14] And this isn't just...
[7201.14 → 7202.28] And it's not just BS.
[7202.66 → 7203.54] It's the truth.
[7203.72 → 7204.28] It's the truth.
[7204.36 → 7206.20] And it's not just like computer parts.
[7206.56 → 7207.68] Consoles are the same kind of thing.
[7207.86 → 7207.96] Yeah.
[7208.00 → 7212.02] A lot of retailers are taking, even if it's like five or 10 cents, they're taking a loss
[7212.02 → 7213.36] when they sell you a console.
[7213.62 → 7215.80] For the sake of having a hope of selling you like...
[7215.80 → 7217.10] That you're going to buy some other stuff.
[7217.10 → 7221.20] You know, a silicone, you know, condom for your remote or...
[7221.20 → 7225.24] Or another controller where they'll make $2 or something.
[7225.24 → 7229.50] Like, he worked at Best Buy, so he has some idea how much money they actually make on stuff.
[7229.54 → 7232.88] If you didn't sell service plans, how much money was Best By making?
[7233.20 → 7235.18] Usually pretty much nothing, to be completely honest.
[7235.26 → 7236.24] There was like...
[7236.24 → 7238.62] I remember most laptops were about four or five bucks margin.
[7238.76 → 7240.08] So we were making four or five dollars.
[7240.08 → 7242.54] Question number two, how much do you think...
[7242.54 → 7245.10] I mean, of course, there's vendor kickbacks on things like notebooks.
[7245.10 → 7247.72] There's vendor kickbacks if you buy a certain amount, so they're making money that way.
[7247.72 → 7249.34] They're making some money that way, but it's not that much.
[7249.62 → 7252.56] And how much do you think it costs to build a Best Buy?
[7253.74 → 7254.74] So much.
[7255.48 → 7257.08] And you can't even just...
[7257.08 → 7257.96] This is a...
[7257.96 → 7260.26] And how much do you think it costs to staff a Best Buy?
[7260.58 → 7262.98] I mean, their business model's dead, and I don't feel bad for them.
[7263.14 → 7263.34] Nope.
[7263.56 → 7266.04] But it doesn't change the fact that when...
[7266.04 → 7266.78] They have to build a building.
[7266.88 → 7267.66] They have to staff the building.
[7267.76 → 7268.58] They have to build warehouses.
[7268.78 → 7272.86] They have to have distribution channels of their own to go in between their own warehouses and their stores.
[7273.02 → 7273.64] They have to...
[7273.64 → 7275.06] So you hear customers complaining.
[7275.30 → 7279.52] So why do we tolerate paying $60 for pants at Lululemon?
[7280.46 → 7282.36] How much do you think those actually cost?
[7282.66 → 7286.38] Compared to, like, at least PC parts have actual freaking gold in them.
[7286.82 → 7288.94] Like, there was actually something inside there that cost money.
[7289.02 → 7292.58] I mean, here, back to Western Digital, who sponsored our router giveaway tonight.
[7292.58 → 7296.62] How much do you think it costs them in engineering to design the next hard drive?
[7297.60 → 7302.32] How many millions upon millions of dollars do you think they spend on engineering,
[7302.78 → 7309.10] on technology that they build, because maybe they will be able to use it 10 years from now?
[7309.52 → 7312.36] Like, the amount of investment that actually goes into this.
[7312.64 → 7317.86] Whereas, like, if you're Coca-Cola, your biggest investment is, like, designing a new bottle.
[7318.40 → 7320.12] Or, no, who was it who did the new bottle recently?
[7320.52 → 7320.98] Was it Pepsi?
[7321.18 → 7321.42] Pepsi.
[7321.82 → 7322.90] Pepsi did a new bottle.
[7323.42 → 7324.14] It's like...
[7324.14 → 7325.56] And everyone freaks out and thinks it's amazing.
[7325.62 → 7326.52] Everyone freaks out and thinks...
[7326.52 → 7333.58] No matter how much Pepsi spent on that bottle, it's not as much as Intel spent on developing the upcoming Haswell CPUs.
[7333.58 → 7334.58] Let me tell you that much.
[7334.98 → 7338.36] And I can tell you right now, Pepsi makes more for every bottle of Pepsi you buy.
[7338.36 → 7338.40] Why?
[7339.16 → 7339.84] Percentage-wise.
[7340.00 → 7341.22] Than Intel makes on a CPU.
[7341.98 → 7342.18] Yeah.
[7342.38 → 7343.00] It's kind of brutal.
[7343.10 → 7344.44] And, like, I just got a message.
[7344.56 → 7346.16] Apparently, Best Buy sold six stores.
[7346.30 → 7346.52] I don't know.
[7347.02 → 7348.88] They got rid of six stores.
[7348.98 → 7349.56] Closed six stores.
[7349.62 → 7349.90] Again.
[7350.16 → 7350.38] Wow.
[7350.62 → 7350.78] Yeah.
[7350.94 → 7353.38] Well, I don't know if that was just in BC or just in Canada.
[7353.46 → 7354.36] That was the last one.
[7354.46 → 7354.88] Not again.
[7354.96 → 7355.24] Oh, okay.
[7355.24 → 7355.72] That was the last one.
[7355.72 → 7360.50] And if you guys don't believe me about this, the proof is there.
[7360.74 → 7362.44] These are publicly traded companies.
[7362.82 → 7366.78] They're not allowed to lie and say we lost money if actually they made a butt-ton of money.
[7367.26 → 7368.88] Because then they'd lose all the money.
[7369.78 → 7371.28] Like, so...
[7371.28 → 7371.70] Sorry, go ahead.
[7371.70 → 7377.20] Like, massive household names if you're a techie companies are losing money every year.
[7377.40 → 7378.40] Like, that's nuts.
[7379.48 → 7379.84] AMD.
[7380.46 → 7381.46] AMD, Micron.
[7381.54 → 7382.22] I mean, AMD.
[7382.54 → 7385.12] Like, I want AMD to pull through.
[7385.36 → 7387.00] I do not want them to die.
[7387.08 → 7387.88] That would be bad.
[7388.10 → 7390.82] And, like, Intel fanboys that are like, ah, AMD sucks.
[7390.94 → 7391.16] Blah.
[7391.32 → 7392.86] You do not want AMD to die.
[7393.00 → 7393.18] Yeah.
[7393.44 → 7393.88] Come on.
[7393.94 → 7394.94] Like, you need competition.
[7394.94 → 7398.78] It is good for the industry to have as many companies innovating.
[7398.86 → 7399.68] I mean, to an extent.
[7399.80 → 7400.82] I've had this conversation before where...
[7400.82 → 7402.34] You don't want 10 billion different companies.
[7402.40 → 7406.36] You don't need, like, 100 different guys making, you know, a gaming keyboard.
[7406.62 → 7406.76] Yeah.
[7406.88 → 7409.02] But, you know, 20 is nice.
[7409.14 → 7411.28] It's good for competition if you have a certain amount.
[7411.36 → 7412.26] More than one is nice.
[7412.48 → 7412.68] Yeah.
[7412.82 → 7414.56] And just having innovation.
[7415.04 → 7416.22] Having innovation is good.
[7417.14 → 7417.94] I mean...
[7417.94 → 7418.94] Yeah.
[7419.68 → 7420.04] There.
[7420.44 → 7422.08] As consumers, why do we tolerate this?
[7422.08 → 7424.32] My pants cost $16 at Costco.
[7424.94 → 7427.50] Why should I pay more than $16 for a pair of blue jeans?
[7428.14 → 7429.06] Why does that exist?
[7430.04 → 7431.46] Why do we allow this to happen?
[7431.60 → 7432.26] Why do we...
[7432.26 → 7433.90] Why do we tolerate...
[7433.90 → 7437.88] I mean, you can go, oh, it's only $4 or $3 or whatever for the can of Red Bull.
[7438.18 → 7438.72] But that's...
[7438.72 → 7439.18] I'm saying...
[7439.18 → 7439.92] That's not like...
[7439.92 → 7441.40] I'm just saying that's how people view it.
[7441.46 → 7441.82] I know, but why do we...
[7441.82 → 7443.76] When they go to the store, it's easy to drop out $4.
[7445.40 → 7446.46] Because we buy it.
[7446.52 → 7448.00] That's the thing, like...
[7448.00 → 7451.10] They make sugar water with marine in it.
[7451.26 → 7452.92] And they sponsor an F1 team.
[7452.92 → 7458.30] All you need to know about a company should be what they...
[7458.30 → 7461.40] How much money they have to blow on random stupid stuff.
[7461.48 → 7463.92] But this is the same problem where it's...
[7464.56 → 7467.70] Nothing will change until the consumer decides it needs to change.
[7467.88 → 7469.24] And they're not going to decide it needs to change.
[7469.70 → 7470.44] We're not going to decide...
[7470.44 → 7474.38] Because if someone's tired, and they want to be still awake,
[7474.72 → 7477.04] even if it doesn't work for them, they're going to go buy an energy drink.
[7477.26 → 7478.44] They're going to go buy an energy drink.
[7478.50 → 7479.86] They're very possibly going to buy a Red Bull.
[7479.86 → 7482.44] So anyway, I guess that's the thing.
[7482.54 → 7483.58] I don't want to hear people...
[7483.58 → 7485.04] I mean, look at LCDs.
[7485.42 → 7489.24] LCD monitors have gone from being a $600, $700 item
[7489.24 → 7490.44] to being...
[7490.44 → 7493.54] You can get a nice IPS monitor for $165 now.
[7494.04 → 7495.44] I know exactly what you're talking about.
[7495.46 → 7496.50] That's a really nice monitor.
[7496.52 → 7496.98] That's an LG.
[7497.24 → 7497.46] Yeah.
[7497.60 → 7499.84] LG IPS 23-inch 1080p monitor.
[7499.84 → 7503.04] How much money do you imagine there is in that for LG to make?
[7503.26 → 7504.12] It must not be making money.
[7504.14 → 7504.56] Not a lot.
[7504.62 → 7507.62] Because that's honestly like a high-tech, nice monitor.
[7507.62 → 7509.74] So anyway, there.
[7509.94 → 7513.02] That's my lecture for you guys to close out the live stream,
[7513.08 → 7514.24] unless you guys have any other topics,
[7514.36 → 7516.04] is stop putting up with this BS.
[7516.98 → 7518.32] I mean, you know what?
[7518.62 → 7522.62] As a consumer, you have the right to get the best deal that you can.
[7523.06 → 7525.30] But why are we complaining about the wrong things?
[7525.30 → 7530.36] Why are we complaining about companies that invest in the future of their products
[7530.36 → 7533.30] versus why aren't we complaining about...
[7533.30 → 7536.34] You know what?
[7536.38 → 7537.34] There's a million examples.
[7537.54 → 7537.94] Shoes.
[7538.14 → 7539.88] Why aren't we complaining about running shoes?
[7540.04 → 7540.74] Oh my goodness.
[7540.94 → 7542.90] Why do we pay $100 for running shoes?
[7543.08 → 7544.96] What's the actual bomb cost on a running shoe?
[7545.08 → 7546.46] What did it cost them to design that?
[7546.50 → 7547.74] In their factory in China.
[7547.80 → 7548.80] In their factory in China.
[7548.90 → 7549.62] I mean, you could go say,
[7549.68 → 7551.44] oh, well, the tech industry outsources everything to...
[7551.44 → 7553.16] Yeah, everyone outsources everything to China.
[7553.84 → 7557.78] If there was an economical way to manufacture Red Bull in China,
[7557.86 → 7558.30] they would do it.
[7558.36 → 7558.98] In fact, they probably do.
[7559.12 → 7559.54] They probably do.
[7559.74 → 7561.40] Google Glass is being manufactured in the States.
[7561.88 → 7562.58] That's interesting.
[7563.08 → 7564.36] That's actually kind of awesome.
[7565.24 → 7566.12] So Google...
[7566.12 → 7567.22] But again, I mean, it's Google.
[7567.32 → 7569.38] They ball so hard, I guess, they just don't even care.
[7569.40 → 7569.84] Don't even care.
[7569.84 → 7570.32] It costs more to make it.
[7570.32 → 7574.54] I wonder where they produce the Chrome books.
[7575.82 → 7576.38] Got to be China.
[7576.38 → 7579.90] There's no notebook manufacturing facility in North America, I can tell you that much.
[7579.90 → 7580.28] That's a good point, yeah.
[7580.48 → 7581.70] Because you need the circuit.
[7581.70 → 7585.22] It's going to be like Handed or Asus or someone like that who's actually building it for them.
[7585.28 → 7587.44] Look at the Nexus 7 built by Asus.
[7587.58 → 7589.56] It's got Asus right on the branding of it.
[7589.82 → 7594.24] So, yeah, it should be no surprise that someone like that is building it.
[7594.54 → 7597.68] But, yeah, let's be resentful of the correct things.
[7597.78 → 7600.30] I was at Michael's craft store.
[7600.82 → 7601.72] Oh, my goodness.
[7601.80 → 7602.70] And they had...
[7602.70 → 7603.82] Yeah, it's just criminal, hey?
[7603.84 → 7604.62] It's brutal.
[7604.82 → 7606.70] They had some modelling clay.
[7607.36 → 7608.36] And I was like, oh, that's cool.
[7608.36 → 7612.60] Maybe I'll get one for, I don't know, someone who likes to model things with modelling clay.
[7613.10 → 7614.68] And I looked at it.
[7614.68 → 7618.46] It was like $5 for a packet that was like this and like skinny.
[7618.96 → 7626.24] And I was like, okay, so you actually have to spend like $100 on this to get all the different colours so you can actually make something.
[7626.24 → 7628.82] And then they're all going to blend together and be brown at the end of it.
[7629.26 → 7631.84] So this is like not reusable in any way.
[7632.46 → 7634.06] It's a total waste of money.
[7634.06 → 7635.92] And the actual cost of this thing is pennies.
[7635.98 → 7636.84] Why do I put up with this?
[7636.88 → 7637.62] Why do I tolerate this?
[7637.66 → 7638.48] Why would I buy this?
[7638.66 → 7641.54] When I was doing my fish tank, I had to buy...
[7641.54 → 7643.68] At the beginning, I don't think you ever saw it in this stage.
[7643.76 → 7644.88] But at the beginning, you know how I had the plant?
[7645.30 → 7645.50] Yeah.
[7645.68 → 7647.42] I also had a complete layer of...
[7647.42 → 7649.66] So you had an oil-cooled machine for those of you who don't know.
[7649.90 → 7652.08] Yeah, there's a video on it on the Life's Tech Tips channel.
[7653.08 → 7655.24] Slicks Oil-Cooled PC or Oil-Cooled Rig.
[7655.40 → 7656.32] You can search for that on YouTube.
[7656.58 → 7656.74] Yeah.
[7657.28 → 7661.12] At the beginning, I also had a pretty thick layer of blue fish rocks.
[7661.32 → 7661.98] Did you see this?
[7662.26 → 7663.04] I don't think it was in the video.
[7663.04 → 7664.04] Nope, I don't think I ever saw the fish rocks.
[7664.04 → 7672.92] Okay, so those became a problem whenever I had to like work on anything because how I had everything strapped to that plexiglass mount on the back, the power supply hung.
[7673.80 → 7676.42] So when I'm putting it in, the power supply would sit on top of the rocks.
[7676.48 → 7677.72] So you would say your computer was hung?
[7678.42 → 7681.68] And if I tried to move the rocks out of the way, they would just sift back in the oil.
[7681.68 → 7685.14] So every single time I tried to put it in, the power supply would sit too high and push my RAM up.
[7685.48 → 7685.80] Oh.
[7686.06 → 7687.52] So it was really hard.
[7687.70 → 7689.66] And that's a plexiglass shield on the top.
[7689.70 → 7693.44] So I can't just like reach my hand in while I'm putting it down because I have to move my hand over the way to put it in.
[7693.82 → 7694.14] Right.
[7694.14 → 7696.26] So it became really difficult to deal with.
[7696.36 → 7697.28] And like I could get it done.
[7697.40 → 7702.80] But honestly, to just put my computer back inside the fish tank would take like an hour or an hour and a half.
[7703.02 → 7703.80] So eventually I took them out.
[7703.98 → 7707.52] But I had a layer of blue fish rocks at the bottom at one point in time.
[7707.56 → 7708.28] And it looked perfect.
[7708.60 → 7711.70] But the bag that I bought for it was like 25 bucks.
[7711.82 → 7712.64] Yeah, that sort of kills me.
[7712.64 → 7714.56] I'm like, these are blue rocks.
[7715.82 → 7716.52] Come on.
[7717.26 → 7722.68] This is why I love sites like DH gate, Monoprice, where they're just like, nope, nope.
[7722.74 → 7728.04] We're actually going to sort of charge for things what we actually like paid for them or at least some sort of proportion.
[7728.76 → 7729.54] Costco is the same way.
[7729.58 → 7732.10] Did you know that Costco actually, I'm a huge Costco advocate.
[7732.22 → 7732.74] I love Costco.
[7732.74 → 7733.26] Costco is awesome.
[7733.36 → 7734.60] They pay their employees well.
[7734.78 → 7735.62] And stuff is cheap.
[7735.70 → 7736.84] They pay their employees well.
[7736.94 → 7738.60] They don't waste money on dumb stuff.
[7738.78 → 7738.92] Nope.
[7738.92 → 7740.70] You go into a Costco and look for the waste.
[7740.92 → 7741.60] You won't find any.
[7741.86 → 7741.92] No.
[7742.50 → 7746.52] Anyway, so Costco has a maximum margin per category that they will charge.
[7747.06 → 7750.60] That is why Costco can't get approved for certain product lines.
[7750.96 → 7755.94] Because the manufacturer doesn't want them to degrade the pricing in the market.
[7756.20 → 7757.92] I knew they couldn't sell suit and stuff.
[7758.02 → 7758.66] But I never knew that.
[7758.74 → 7759.56] That's fascinating.
[7759.56 → 7759.76] That's why.
[7760.16 → 7763.28] Costco, actually, there was a big public spat with Apple.
[7763.80 → 7764.02] Yeah.
[7764.12 → 7766.00] That's why Costco couldn't carry iPods.
[7766.10 → 7767.98] Because they refused to sell at MSRP.
[7767.98 → 7771.32] They said, no, our maximum markup for that category is this.
[7771.38 → 7772.40] And that's what we're going to sell it at.
[7772.72 → 7775.86] If you want access to our enormous customer base.
[7775.88 → 7776.34] Oh, massive.
[7776.68 → 7780.40] I mean, Costco is one of the few companies that actually gave the old to Apple.
[7781.32 → 7782.00] That's awesome.
[7782.14 → 7782.44] They're great.
[7782.46 → 7783.22] I love Costco.
[7783.46 → 7783.72] They're great.
[7784.14 → 7786.70] All my grocery shopping, if I can swing it, goes there.
[7786.82 → 7790.86] Those of you not in North America, I wish you guys had Costco.
[7791.04 → 7791.72] They're only in North America?
[7791.88 → 7792.86] I believe they're North America.
[7792.94 → 7793.92] I have no idea.
[7794.16 → 7795.32] I could actually be wrong about that.
[7795.32 → 7798.44] Anyway, thank you guys for tuning into the live stream.
[7798.66 → 7799.72] I hope you enjoyed it.
[7799.78 → 7800.52] Did you have anything else?
[7801.16 → 7802.56] Other than Battle toads.
[7802.60 → 7802.82] Oh, yeah.
[7802.86 → 7803.62] Let's do Battle toads.
[7804.42 → 7808.30] So I was out with Mr. Wizard and some friends of ours.
[7808.62 → 7811.66] And we were going around the Vancouver area to...
[7811.66 → 7813.20] Why do you have to rub in your friends all the time?
[7814.38 → 7815.00] And how you have them.
[7818.00 → 7818.40] Um...
[7818.40 → 7819.28] That's awkward.
[7819.88 → 7824.50] So we were going around the Vancouver area to game shops that carried old school games.
[7824.56 → 7826.30] Because I like collecting and playing old school games.
[7826.82 → 7829.72] If I'm not playing on a computer, I'm playing old consoles.
[7829.80 → 7830.54] Can I be your Anna White?
[7830.70 → 7831.04] You can.
[7831.18 → 7831.38] Okay.
[7831.52 → 7833.14] I think this is the first time that you Anna White-ed.
[7833.32 → 7833.64] Are you...
[7833.64 → 7834.48] You have to...
[7834.48 → 7834.80] Come on.
[7835.24 → 7835.88] There you go.
[7835.88 → 7836.68] Um...
[7836.68 → 7838.88] So we're going around to old school game shops.
[7839.88 → 7841.34] And we found Battle toads.
[7841.40 → 7845.32] This is not the like, super insanely iconic NEW Battle toads.
[7845.40 → 7846.74] This is SNES Battle toads.
[7847.20 → 7847.52] Um...
[7847.52 → 7848.96] So you can actually beat this one.
[7849.62 → 7850.84] Um...
[7850.84 → 7852.32] But it's, like, still new in box.
[7852.44 → 7854.04] Be careful with the box, please.
[7854.06 → 7854.80] It's new in box?
[7854.96 → 7855.86] It's not new in box.
[7855.88 → 7856.50] Like new in box.
[7856.52 → 7857.22] It's like new in box.
[7857.24 → 7857.42] No, no.
[7857.44 → 7858.74] This is the one that was already creased.
[7858.78 → 7859.10] I checked.
[7859.22 → 7859.48] Okay.
[7859.66 → 7860.94] I am a professional unboxed.
[7860.94 → 7862.50] I thought you just creased that.
[7862.62 → 7862.88] Nope.
[7863.12 → 7863.44] Okay.
[7864.28 → 7865.32] Professional unboxed here.
[7865.32 → 7866.06] It's like new in box.
[7866.14 → 7867.54] It still has the dust cover on the bottom.
[7867.68 → 7870.02] It has the original poster, which has never been unfolded.
[7870.08 → 7870.28] Okay.
[7870.32 → 7871.24] I won't unfold the poster.
[7871.42 → 7871.70] Um...
[7871.70 → 7872.76] I did that.
[7872.78 → 7873.40] There's the manual.
[7873.54 → 7873.96] There's the manual.
[7874.04 → 7874.58] That's the poster.
[7874.82 → 7877.56] Like, it's in really, perfect condition, so I couldn't pass it up.
[7877.92 → 7881.12] And it's probably one of my favourite things in my old school gaming collection now.
[7881.28 → 7882.24] Other than Descent 2.
[7882.36 → 7883.78] Descent 2 will never be dethroned.
[7884.14 → 7884.40] Okay.
[7884.84 → 7885.76] Because that's just...
[7885.76 → 7887.44] Because that has, like, awesome sentimental value.
[7887.44 → 7890.16] I've never actually played SNES Battle toads before.
[7890.46 → 7891.50] One of the few...
[7891.50 → 7891.76] Uh...
[7891.76 → 7893.48] One of the few sort of gaming...
[7893.48 → 7894.44] Because I'm not much of...
[7894.44 → 7894.84] I'm...
[7894.84 → 7895.94] I mean, you've seen my house.
[7896.02 → 7897.62] Do I have much sentimental stuff in there?
[7898.18 → 7898.50] No.
[7898.86 → 7899.22] Okay.
[7899.66 → 7901.52] I actually have a bin in my attic.
[7901.72 → 7902.70] Yeah, I know about that.
[7902.78 → 7902.96] That has...
[7902.96 → 7904.60] That's, like, hidden away in your attic.
[7904.92 → 7906.54] All of my sentimental crap is in there.
[7906.58 → 7907.54] It's like one Rubber maid bin.
[7907.64 → 7907.98] That's it.
[7907.98 → 7908.72] Um...
[7908.72 → 7908.98] It...
[7908.98 → 7914.66] The only gaming-related thing I think I have in there is the manual for my copy of Final Fantasy 3.
[7914.94 → 7915.24] Right.
[7915.24 → 7917.70] And it is so dog-eared.
[7917.70 → 7920.20] So it has zero resale value.
[7920.20 → 7921.88] The cover is gone.
[7922.10 → 7925.76] So it's just, like, the page two to pages second to last.
[7926.24 → 7927.94] And, um...
[7927.94 → 7931.68] The only reason I kept it is because that was my favourite game growing up.
[7932.02 → 7939.38] And I have actually legitimately read the manual so many times, you know, when I wasn't allowed to have video game time or whatever else.
[7939.74 → 7941.50] That that's why it's dog-eared like that.
[7941.52 → 7942.04] I remember doing that.
[7943.36 → 7944.98] Reading, like, a manual.
[7945.24 → 7948.00] Reading through key bindings that you've memorized for years.
[7948.44 → 7949.00] Just...
[7949.00 → 7950.48] Just because you can't play a game.
[7950.50 → 7951.78] It's like reading through all the spells.
[7951.98 → 7956.64] And, like, the thing about a Final Fantasy manual is it's never going to have all the information in it anyway.
[7956.88 → 7957.88] So, like, they'd have...
[7957.88 → 7960.48] They had, like, a spell in the manual that was just question marks.
[7960.64 → 7961.48] And I'm like...
[7961.48 → 7962.92] So I have to find this spell.
[7963.06 → 7964.96] And it doesn't say, like, question marks for what it does.
[7965.02 → 7967.44] And they'd have relics for, like, question marks for what they do.
[7967.76 → 7968.88] And I'm just like, okay.
[7968.88 → 7969.68] Oh, man.
[7969.70 → 7974.14] But, like, I'd read through, and I'd be like, how many times more powerful is Fire 3 than Fire 2?
[7974.58 → 7974.74] Bro.
[7974.90 → 7975.26] Ah!
[7976.46 → 7983.32] My favourite piece of, like, not an actual game, sentimental stuff, is my game guide to Borrowing.
[7983.98 → 7987.54] The like, textbook that they give you so that you can play Borrowing.
[7987.68 → 7991.32] Because I've said the story before about how I never even started the main quest and all that kind of stuff.
[7991.38 → 7991.56] Yeah.
[7991.56 → 7993.84] Um, but my dad and I would play.
[7993.92 → 7998.98] And I read through this manual so much that, like, all the corners and everything are, like, hardcore bent up.
[7999.10 → 7999.30] Nice.
[7999.30 → 8001.10] The cover is completely ripped off.
[8001.10 → 8006.58] Like, all the pages are, like, slightly, like, you can see if I was like, oh, we were doing that quest, and I was eating Cheetos.
[8006.88 → 8007.84] Or, like...
[8007.84 → 8009.06] Love that.
[8009.18 → 8009.50] Cheetos.
[8010.16 → 8011.08] All about the Cheetos.
[8011.12 → 8012.12] I actually kind of hate Cheetos.
[8012.36 → 8013.46] Not to offend anyone.
[8013.46 → 8014.42] But, like, that's what I meant.
[8014.52 → 8015.48] Like, like, there's...
[8015.48 → 8016.68] It is used.
[8016.86 → 8020.54] It is, like, the most piece of, like, the most used thing that I probably even own.
[8021.06 → 8025.60] And I bought a new one eventually because the expansions came out and stuff, but I still have my original.
[8025.60 → 8034.70] So if anyone knows anyone at Bethesda, that is how devoted the person who did not get a single beta invite...
[8034.70 → 8035.62] So depressed.
[8036.08 → 8036.68] Oh, oh.
[8037.14 → 8038.68] I'm sorry for bringing this up.
[8038.76 → 8039.66] I shouldn't have even done it.
[8039.88 → 8042.26] Oh, no.
[8042.26 → 8046.28] Okay, so they sent out the thing saying, like, here, we're doing our first wave of beta invites.
[8046.72 → 8047.92] And I sent...
[8047.92 → 8049.90] Spent that entire day with my phone.
[8049.98 → 8054.48] Like, I had the screen on pretty much the entire day, which is insane because the battery life on this phone is dead now.
[8054.48 → 8061.18] And I had it, like, plugged into USB charters so that if my phone got the email first, then I would know faster than if my computer got it first.
[8061.48 → 8068.00] And I had my browser open in Opera because Opera has an auto-refreshing feature on Gmail.
[8068.38 → 8069.84] Being like, come on.
[8070.40 → 8071.94] I want my beta code.
[8072.26 → 8074.70] And I did not get in the Elder Scrolls Online beta.
[8074.88 → 8077.74] And I am pretty much the saddest panda that ever existed.
[8079.10 → 8079.42] Oh.
[8079.42 → 8083.70] So on that sobering note, goodnight, everyone.
[8083.86 → 8087.12] And thank you for tuning in to the Linus Tech Tips livestream.
[8087.34 → 8091.62] We do these every Friday night at 9 p.m. Pacific time.
[8091.72 → 8092.88] So that's Vancouver time.
[8093.24 → 8096.18] So I have a lot of people ask me what time is that in my time zone.
[8096.32 → 8097.04] Holy crap.
[8097.26 → 8098.36] Go find a world clock.
[8099.36 → 8101.32] Because daily saving times and stuff.
[8101.46 → 8102.36] We don't know.
[8102.36 → 8102.88] Okay.
[8103.08 → 8104.26] 2100 hours.
[8104.62 → 8105.88] Vancouver, B.C. time.
[8106.36 → 8109.26] For that matter, Vancouver, Washington time is fine, too.
[8110.26 → 8111.06] No, wait.
[8111.40 → 8111.64] Yes.
[8111.84 → 8112.06] Yes.
[8112.18 → 8113.88] Vancouver, Washington time is fine, too.
[8114.48 → 8116.18] Washington State, not Washington, D.C.
[8116.18 → 8118.40] There's no suburb of Washington, D.C. called Vancouver.
[8118.76 → 8119.62] I don't think.
[8120.14 → 8122.50] I think Vancouver landed on the West Coast.
[8122.50 → 8125.10] So anything named after him should theoretically be here.
[8126.10 → 8127.12] Thanks for tuning in.
[8127.34 → 8127.50] Yeah.
[8128.04 → 8128.76] Goodnight, everybody.
[8129.24 → 8129.78] Or good morning.
