[0.00 --> 6.56]  And we're live! Good evening everybody! It might not actually be evening where you
[6.56 --> 11.80]  are but I think you kind of get my point. Oh there's already... oh look at this,
[11.80 --> 16.60]  look at this. We've already got a viewer who's who's all about sort of our audio
[16.60 --> 23.16]  issues and how I should fire Slick and hire him so that... or her... could be a
[23.16 --> 28.68]  girl. I heard there's a girl on the internet. What's the name? Oh yeah I have
[28.68 --> 34.74]  no idea. Yeah, AVO. No idea. A lot of girls on that internet. Tons of them. Or at least
[34.74 --> 41.04]  pictures that creepers took of girls on the internet. It's a lot of that. So
[41.04 --> 44.04]  good night every... oh good night no wait we're not done that's more of a we're done
[44.04 --> 47.44]  thing. It's night here though it's actually very late at night we had a very
[47.44 --> 51.78]  long day today. We had once again you know what for those of you who complain
[51.78 --> 57.00]  that it's unprofessional of us to eat on the live stream you know what we're very
[57.00 --> 61.20]  sorry that we have to do that and trust us it's like we're not that cool with...
[61.20 --> 70.92]  what time like what time did we leave today? This morning? Like leave... 8.45? 9? Yeah okay so so we got
[70.92 --> 75.18]  started around 9 today and then we actually start... that's pretty typical. On
[75.18 --> 79.86]  Fridays we shoot MCIX tech tips so then we make it back here for our live stream at
[79.86 --> 83.76]  nine o'clock our time and then we go for another hour and a half so you guys do
[83.76 --> 90.06]  the math. And then there's work afterwards because I have to then watch the live
[90.06 --> 100.06]  stream... I have to then watch the live stream... I spilled food in my lap... so do I prefer this
[100.06 --> 108.06]  system? The answer is no. No. Because it results in like a 13 14 hour day. Yeah pretty much. And then we get to eat at the like 12 hours.
[108.06 --> 111.96]  And then we get to eat at the like 12 hour point. That's the first time we get to eat.
[111.96 --> 118.06]  Yep. Busy busy days. So the good news is we have a busy busy live stream for you.
[118.06 --> 128.26]  One of the biggest bits of news this week was that Nvidia has started... well not they've started but they are not talking about it at all.
[128.26 --> 135.16]  But the Internet's are starting to talk about a replacement for the GTX 680. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
[135.16 --> 146.16]  So the rumor... the word on the street is it's going to be based on failed Tesla cores. So Tesla's used for... what's that? A supercomputer that deployed like a bajillion
[146.16 --> 155.06]  Tesla's not that long ago. I won't know the name of it. Yeah I can't remember the name of it. But Tesla's used for super computing. It's used for things like cloud gaming.
[155.06 --> 162.06]  So if you're not familiar with cloud gaming that's... you know what I'll let you talk about cloud gaming while I try to take like three bites here.
[162.06 --> 168.16]  I'm not a fan of cloud gaming but the idea is that it's all rendered and everything's pre-processed in the cloud and then streamed down to your computer.
[168.16 --> 175.16]  Okay so tell me this about cloud gaming. Based on... oh right you weren't there for Project Shield.
[175.16 --> 186.16]  Of course you have to troll me again. No I had forgotten. Because I was pretty down on cloud gaming to start with. Like I was like oh yeah this isn't gonna work. Bye bye.
[186.16 --> 198.14]  But based on what I saw from Project Shield it could work. Is that not local streaming though? Yes it's local streaming but it's local streaming over wireless which can't be very
[198.14 --> 209.14]  that much better than remote streaming over copper. Right. Or better yet fiber. Yeah. So when fiber hits cloud gaming is gonna make your gaming computer totally irrelevant forever.
[209.14 --> 221.14]  It will never matter ever again. Nope I'll play legacy games. You'll play legacy games. Yup. You know what's funny is I actually have parts in my attic that are... I have a...
[221.14 --> 224.14]  Shhhhhh. Yeah my... Shhhhhh. My wife doesn't know about...
[224.14 --> 234.14]  Shhhhhh. Because she told me when we moved here she told me to throw out all of the unnecessary tech crap that I have and I was like oh yeah yeah it's all gone. It's all gone. Don't worry about it. Um...
[234.14 --> 248.14]  It's hiding in the attic. Yeah there's a box hiding in the attic of enough legacy parts. I think I have a P2-233, some EDO RAM, or it might have been SD RAM by that time. Might be SD RAM.
[248.14 --> 254.14]  I've got an old old IDE like ATA-33 hard drive. Um...
[254.14 --> 265.14]  Like an AWE64 sound card. ISA. ISA! AWE64 sound card. And my intention at some point is to find like a balling case.
[265.14 --> 269.14]  And then just like I've got an AT power supply to go with it.
[269.14 --> 278.14]  And then I'm gonna try like Frankenstein it into this balling awesome looking machine so I can have a dedicated box just to play TIE Fighter.
[278.14 --> 282.14]  So I've got my old Thrustmaster Top Gun joystick.
[282.14 --> 284.14]  I saw that too.
[284.14 --> 286.14]  Serial. Serial joystick.
[286.14 --> 291.14]  Epic. There's one guy on the forums, you gotta check out his build log. He did, I don't remember all your specs if you're watching, I'm sorry.
[291.14 --> 295.14]  Um, but the thing that stood out the most was he got Voodoo SLI running.
[295.14 --> 297.14]  I told you about this I think.
[297.14 --> 298.14]  Mmhmm.
[298.14 --> 300.14]  Yeah, and that's just so awesome.
[300.14 --> 301.14]  So awesome.
[301.14 --> 304.14]  Wasn't he like even running like old benchmarks on it?
[304.14 --> 311.14]  Yeah, he was running old benchmarks and trying to prove his platform and like showing off him playing games and like really really cool, really cool build log.
[311.14 --> 318.14]  He's talking about how he'd like buy stuff and people would just send like, like he said his two processors just came like taped together.
[318.14 --> 319.14]  Two processors?
[319.14 --> 320.14]  Yeah.
[320.14 --> 321.14]  So it's like a dual CPU?
[321.14 --> 322.14]  Yeah.
[322.14 --> 323.14]  What like, oh it must be like Pentium 3's.
[323.14 --> 325.14]  It's like super, super, super, super high end, yeah.
[325.14 --> 327.14]  I think it might be Pentium.
[327.14 --> 330.14]  I actually acquired back before, uh, back.
[330.14 --> 331.14]  I don't remember what it is.
[331.14 --> 338.14]  Before dual cores were affordable, um, I had the, I, I, I, I acquired two Pentium 3 one gigahertz.
[338.14 --> 343.14]  And I think I got something like a gig and a half of RAM or something for it.
[343.14 --> 352.14]  Uh, when I upgraded my, my in-laws machine a number of years ago, like this was, this must've been like six years ago because, um, and you know what?
[352.14 --> 365.14]  It actually kind of rocked running a modern OS like windows XP with dual processors, even though they were underpowered for something like an office machine is way better than a single core.
[365.14 --> 373.14]  One of my, one of my most prized possessions within my, like the, the, like room in your house where you put all your tech crap in.
[373.14 --> 379.14]  One of my most prized possessions in there, which I have like wrapped up like crazy in an anti-static bag so that I hope it won't die.
[379.14 --> 383.14]  Is a one gig dim of, uh, DDR1.
[383.14 --> 384.14]  Seriously?
[384.14 --> 385.14]  Yeah.
[385.14 --> 386.14]  That's freaking awesome.
[386.14 --> 387.14]  Those were expensive.
[387.14 --> 389.14]  Those were like crazy.
[389.14 --> 390.14]  I don't know where I got it from.
[390.14 --> 391.14]  I didn't buy it.
[391.14 --> 395.14]  Like I probably got out of some system that a friend was like, oh, you can just have this.
[395.14 --> 396.14]  I'm buying a new one.
[396.14 --> 401.14]  I know you do computer crap and they probably just bought a new system from Best Buy and like gave me their old crappy one.
[401.14 --> 404.14]  Crappy quote unquote because it had a one gig DDR1 dim in it.
[404.14 --> 408.14]  But yeah, I, I harvested that and just hold onto it with dear life.
[408.14 --> 414.14]  And every single time that I need to make like an old school system for whatever reason, I just throw it in to be like, yeah.
[414.14 --> 418.14]  Now there's no RAM problems instantly.
[418.14 --> 421.14]  I can stack it with like however many other sticks I want.
[421.14 --> 424.14]  It's still usually more than half of the RAM in the whole system.
[424.14 --> 426.14]  It's just so epic.
[426.14 --> 427.14]  That's awesome.
[427.14 --> 434.14]  I don't know if I have any, I don't know if I have any old, okay, probably my Thrustmaster Top Gun.
[434.14 --> 437.14]  So that joystick is, is like legendary for me.
[437.14 --> 446.14]  Other than that, you know, I wish, I wish I still had my monitor, my CRT monitor.
[446.14 --> 453.14]  So for those of you who knew CRT monitors, I had a P95F Plus B from ViewSonic, which was Aperture Grill.
[453.14 --> 459.14]  So it wasn't using that, whatever it was, Shadow Mask, I think was the other competing technology.
[459.14 --> 464.14]  So Aperture Grill was one of those things where, you know, there was a lot of debate on the forums.
[464.14 --> 466.14]  Should I get an Aperture Grill monitor?
[466.14 --> 467.14]  Should I not?
[467.14 --> 472.14]  Because the Aperture Grill causes two faint lines at about the top third of the screen and the bottom third of the screen
[472.14 --> 482.14]  that allow the picture to be much more square and much more clear for the flat screen, but actually cause those lines to be visible to you.
[482.14 --> 485.14]  So people are like, whoa, I couldn't get used to it.
[485.14 --> 488.14]  Or people are like, oh, I didn't even see it after two, three days.
[488.14 --> 489.14]  So I took the plunge.
[489.14 --> 491.14]  I got myself an Aperture Grill monitor.
[491.14 --> 494.14]  I loved that monitor.
[494.14 --> 496.14]  One of my siblings took a quarter to it.
[497.14 --> 499.14]  Oh, you never told me how it died.
[499.14 --> 501.14]  The anti-glare coating in the middle.
[501.14 --> 503.14]  There was nothing wrong with the monitor.
[503.14 --> 506.14]  So I got a replacement from ViewSonic.
[506.14 --> 507.14]  It was terrible.
[507.14 --> 509.14]  It was like a refurbished.
[509.14 --> 512.14]  This was when CRTs were not even really in production anymore.
[512.14 --> 516.14]  They got me the replacement when I was just like, this is unusable.
[516.14 --> 518.14]  So I pawned it off for cheap.
[518.14 --> 521.14]  And that was the end of my P95F Plus B.
[521.14 --> 526.14]  And that was when I made the switch very begrudgingly to LCD.
[526.14 --> 531.14]  And I moved to an Acer 1916W.
[531.14 --> 536.14]  That 1440 by 900 was it?
[536.14 --> 537.14]  I don't remember.
[537.14 --> 538.14]  I just remember the monitor.
[538.14 --> 539.14]  I don't remember.
[539.14 --> 543.14]  It was like, whatever the resolution was, it was like super low res.
[543.14 --> 546.14]  And I was just like, oh, it's widescreen.
[546.14 --> 547.14]  It's really small.
[547.14 --> 550.14]  And I don't have a lot of desktop room.
[550.14 --> 552.14]  Like slow clap myself.
[552.14 --> 557.14]  So I blew like $600-$700 on a 2405 FPW.
[557.14 --> 560.14]  And then that's the one that is still running on my wife's computer.
[560.14 --> 562.14]  It's starting to die though.
[562.14 --> 563.14]  Is it?
[563.14 --> 564.14]  Yeah.
[564.14 --> 565.14]  I'm super sad.
[565.14 --> 566.14]  I haven't noticed.
[566.14 --> 567.14]  I haven't spent like any time on it.
[567.14 --> 569.14]  The edges are yellowing.
[569.14 --> 570.14]  Aww.
[570.14 --> 571.14]  Yeah.
[571.14 --> 572.14]  Well, it's cathode backlit.
[572.14 --> 578.14]  So guys, for those of you who don't know, an LED screen is not a thing.
[578.14 --> 579.14]  Okay?
[579.14 --> 580.14]  I'm going to let that sink in for a minute.
[580.14 --> 581.14]  That's why it's LCD-LED.
[581.14 --> 583.14]  Yeah, but people don't get that.
[583.14 --> 584.14]  No, I know.
[584.14 --> 587.14]  People are like, oh, I want an LED monitor.
[587.14 --> 590.14]  An LED monitor would be like a light board.
[590.14 --> 592.14]  Like one of those billboards.
[592.14 --> 594.14]  That's an LED monitor.
[594.14 --> 596.14]  Trust me, you don't want one of those.
[596.14 --> 599.14]  Or an OLED monitor could technically.
[599.14 --> 600.14]  Yeah.
[600.14 --> 601.14]  Because that's an organic light image.
[601.14 --> 602.14]  Yeah.
[602.14 --> 603.14]  So that would technically be an LED monitor.
[603.14 --> 604.14]  That would be balling.
[604.14 --> 605.14]  But we can't buy those yet.
[605.14 --> 606.14]  No.
[606.14 --> 607.14]  Or we can, but...
[607.14 --> 608.14]  Money.
[608.14 --> 611.14]  Yeah, we have to be like a sultan of like Malaysia or something.
[612.14 --> 615.14]  And then we can mount our OLED monitors in all of our cars.
[615.14 --> 617.14]  They can go clear, right?
[617.14 --> 619.14]  Oh, there was one on display at CES that was transparent.
[619.14 --> 620.14]  That was transparent.
[620.14 --> 622.14]  Put it as your windshield.
[622.14 --> 623.14]  Yeah, that would be illegal.
[623.14 --> 625.14]  I'm sure in any country anywhere.
[625.14 --> 626.14]  Why?
[626.14 --> 627.14]  What do you mean why?
[627.14 --> 629.14]  Because you could overlay like your speed and everything.
[629.14 --> 631.14]  Or you could overlay a television show.
[631.14 --> 636.14]  Or you could like software mod it so that it forces to not show things on certain parts
[636.14 --> 637.14]  of the screen.
[637.14 --> 638.14]  Of course you won't break through it.
[638.14 --> 639.14]  Yeah, okay.
[639.14 --> 644.14]  I was going to say if someone handed you a car that had a software limited screen in the
[644.14 --> 646.14]  windshield, what's the first thing you would do?
[646.14 --> 648.14]  I'm not going to go into that topic.
[648.14 --> 650.14]  But that would be really cool.
[650.14 --> 651.14]  Yay!
[651.14 --> 652.14]  I want a screen.
[652.14 --> 653.14]  Right.
[653.14 --> 658.14]  So LED screens and LCD screens are not different things.
[658.14 --> 660.14]  So an LCD is a liquid crystal display.
[660.14 --> 661.14]  It's a panel.
[661.14 --> 662.14]  Okay?
[662.14 --> 663.14]  So it's thin.
[663.14 --> 664.14]  It's thin.
[664.14 --> 665.14]  It just goes at the front.
[665.14 --> 670.14]  And then CCFL or fluorescent, those are the same thing.
[670.14 --> 674.14]  So fluorescent lights go behind it and shine through the LCD panel.
[674.14 --> 680.14]  Or you can have an array of LED lights that shine through the LCD panel.
[680.14 --> 682.14]  So that's the difference.
[682.14 --> 687.14]  So anyway, it's an older fluorescent LCD monitor and what happens to them is you can actually
[687.14 --> 688.14]  replace the cathodes.
[688.14 --> 689.14]  I don't know if you knew that.
[689.14 --> 690.14]  Yeah.
[690.14 --> 693.14]  You can replace the cathodes but it's probably not worth it at this point.
[693.14 --> 694.14]  Actually, maybe.
[694.14 --> 696.14]  It's probably really expensive.
[696.14 --> 698.14]  24 inch VA panel though.
[698.14 --> 701.14]  It was a very well regarded monitor at the time.
[701.14 --> 703.14]  Do you think there might just be like stock hanging around?
[703.14 --> 704.14]  I don't know.
[704.14 --> 707.14]  I don't know if I'd be able to get a fluorescent tubes for it.
[707.14 --> 708.14]  It's worth looking into.
[708.14 --> 709.14]  That would be a fun video actually if you could find some.
[709.14 --> 710.14]  But they're so cheap now.
[710.14 --> 715.14]  You can get an LED backlit LCD for like nothing now.
[715.14 --> 718.14]  And the advantage of LED is that they don't fade over time.
[718.14 --> 722.14]  They don't yellow over time and they last for a really long time.
[722.14 --> 730.14]  Which brings us gracefully back to Tesla and NVIDIA's upcoming replacement GeForce card.
[730.14 --> 738.14]  So Tesla is used for compute applications, for cloud gaming, and they want to take failed
[738.14 --> 741.14]  Tesla cores which doesn't mean failed.
[741.14 --> 743.14]  So it's binning process.
[743.14 --> 744.14]  Yes.
[744.14 --> 746.14]  The binning process is the key here.
[746.14 --> 754.14]  So you can have a Tesla spec that goes whatever gigahertz, whatever memory bus, whatever...
[754.14 --> 758.14]  Okay, so that's the only thing most people think about is what speed does it run at.
[758.14 --> 759.14]  No.
[759.14 --> 760.14]  There's way more than that.
[760.14 --> 764.14]  Because for applications like compute, where they're installing these in blades, they're
[764.14 --> 767.14]  gonna have very strict power and heat guidelines.
[767.14 --> 771.14]  So there could be a chip that runs at 2 gigahertz at stock voltage.
[771.14 --> 775.14]  But if it's hot like a mofo, it's totally unusable.
[775.14 --> 777.14]  Something can be hot like a mofo.
[777.14 --> 778.14]  I'm hot like a mofo.
[778.14 --> 779.14]  I'm hot like a mofo.
[779.14 --> 780.14]  What?
[780.14 --> 781.14]  Actually, I'm really cold right now.
[781.14 --> 782.14]  I could use a jacket.
[782.14 --> 783.14]  The food's like frozen.
[783.14 --> 784.14]  I know.
[784.14 --> 785.14]  You microwaved yours, but I bet it's cold now.
[785.14 --> 786.14]  Yes.
[786.14 --> 787.14]  The potatoes are like solid.
[787.14 --> 788.14]  But anyways.
[788.14 --> 789.14]  So the binning process.
[789.14 --> 790.14]  Why don't you get into the binning process while I show them how cold it is.
[790.14 --> 791.14]  Oh, it's not that cold.
[791.14 --> 792.14]  People are gonna make fun of us.
[792.14 --> 793.14]  Well, it's pretty cold.
[793.14 --> 794.14]  It's not that cold.
[794.14 --> 795.14]  It's cold.
[795.14 --> 796.14]  It's not as cold as like two days ago.
[796.14 --> 797.14]  It's 12 degrees in here and you're in a t-shirt.
[797.14 --> 798.14]  Nice.
[798.14 --> 801.14]  Which sort of is more of a reflection on your wisdom and planning than it is on the temperature
[801.14 --> 802.14]  in the room.
[802.14 --> 803.14]  I don't think it's that cold though.
[803.14 --> 804.14]  I don't know.
[804.14 --> 805.14]  I think it's pretty cold.
[805.14 --> 806.14]  I don't know.
[806.14 --> 807.14]  I think it's pretty cold.
[807.14 --> 808.14]  It's cold.
[808.14 --> 809.14]  It's cold.
[809.14 --> 810.14]  It's cold.
[810.14 --> 811.14]  It's cold.
[811.14 --> 812.14]  It's cold.
[812.14 --> 813.14]  It's cold.
[813.14 --> 814.14]  It's cold.
[814.14 --> 815.14]  It's cold.
[815.14 --> 816.14]  It's cold.
[816.14 --> 817.14]  It's cold.
[817.14 --> 818.14]  It's cold.
[818.14 --> 819.14]  It's cold.
[819.14 --> 820.14]  It's cold.
[820.14 --> 821.14]  It's cold.
[821.14 --> 822.14]  It's cold.
[822.14 --> 823.14]  It's cold.
[823.14 --> 824.14]  It's cold.
[824.14 --> 825.14]  I don't think it's cold though.
[825.14 --> 826.14]  I don't know.
[826.14 --> 827.14]  I think it's cold.
[827.14 --> 828.14]  We have the lights pointed at us though.
[828.14 --> 829.14]  That's probably helping a little bit.
[829.14 --> 830.14]  Although they're fluorescent lights.
[830.14 --> 831.14]  So that's a thing.
[831.14 --> 832.14]  They don't really heat up that much.
[832.14 --> 833.14]  If we had the ones from the NCX studio here.
[833.14 --> 834.14]  That would heat up the whole garage.
[834.14 --> 835.14]  Those are ridiculous.
[835.14 --> 836.14]  So the other main light technology is incandescent which means basically fire.
[836.14 --> 837.14]  Yeah.
[837.14 --> 838.14]  That's what it means.
[838.14 --> 844.14]  So that's where something is just glowing so white hot and so bright that it
[844.14 --> 846.14]  throws light all over everything around it.
[846.14 --> 852.14]  Those are hot compared to CCFLs which are hot compared to LEDs.
[852.14 --> 855.14]  Are you just checking to make sure the audio is actually good?
[855.14 --> 856.14]  Because I never checked.
[856.14 --> 857.14]  Yes.
[857.14 --> 858.14]  That's a good idea.
[858.14 --> 860.14]  I have the Twitch chat open here too.
[860.14 --> 861.14]  Okay.
[861.14 --> 862.14]  We'll maybe open that.
[862.14 --> 868.14]  I was also going to bring up the list of companies and what games and groups were purchased.
[868.14 --> 869.14]  Good thinking.
[869.14 --> 870.14]  I'll do some Twitter questions.
[870.14 --> 873.14]  Except I've got to finish this NVIDIA topic that I've been really struggling to actually
[873.14 --> 874.14]  manage to finish.
[874.14 --> 875.14]  Sounds good.
[875.14 --> 880.14]  So the new card coming is going to be a replacement for the 690.
[880.14 --> 882.14]  It's going to be failed Tesla cores.
[882.14 --> 883.14]  Which doesn't mean they're failed.
[883.14 --> 887.14]  It could mean that they run at a slightly higher power envelope which is fine when you
[887.14 --> 892.14]  can throw a big old dual slot cooler on it and like a nice well ventilated gaming chassis.
[892.14 --> 894.14]  It's a no big deal.
[894.14 --> 899.14]  And we're expecting this to be an enormous, well I'm expecting it to be based on sort of
[899.14 --> 903.14]  the leaked specs that have been seen and based on what we know, actually not even leaked specs,
[903.14 --> 910.14]  based on what we know about Tesla specs, this thing should be a huge generational boost in performance.
[910.14 --> 918.14]  So this was, this core was ready back when NVIDIA was launching GTX 680.
[918.14 --> 922.14]  But for whatever reason, whether it was due to the competitive landscape, whether it was
[922.14 --> 928.14]  due to the yields on this gigantic die, it's very expensive to manufacture for a number of reasons.
[928.14 --> 934.14]  So whether it was due to the yields, whether it was due to just it being very difficult,
[934.14 --> 938.14]  there being very few production lines that could actually manufacture this monstrosity,
[938.14 --> 941.14]  they held it back from the G-Force line and have only been using it for Tesla.
[941.14 --> 945.14]  I think it only recently made it to Quadro as well, is that correct?
[945.14 --> 949.14]  I think that was a while back that it made it to Quadro, not that long ago though.
[949.14 --> 951.14]  Correct me if I'm wrong though guys.
[951.14 --> 956.14]  So I'm really excited because I'm not a huge fan of dual GPU solutions.
[956.14 --> 961.14]  I don't like the inconsistency of their performance, so the way that in some games they'll be like this.
[961.14 --> 964.14]  When you compare to sort of a better single card, you know, if you go dual GPU,
[964.14 --> 967.14]  okay sometimes it's here, sometimes it's here, sometimes it's here, sometimes it's here.
[967.14 --> 969.14]  Because you're paying more for it.
[969.14 --> 977.14]  And there's just more general, like if there's a game that runs perfectly on all configurations except one,
[977.14 --> 982.14]  you know, all single cards run, I pretty much guarantee you, it's all the single card configs that work
[982.14 --> 987.14]  and some dual card configuration that doesn't work because it's a lot more complicated to code the drivers for it.
[987.14 --> 995.14]  So really excited about another truly high-end GPU that's using a single GPU, high-end graphics card using a single GPU,
[995.14 --> 999.14]  and what that'll mean for, well, for everyone.
[999.14 --> 1004.14]  Are you ready to join me for another of our main discussion topics or should I do some Twitter chat?
[1004.14 --> 1005.14]  I almost found it.
[1005.14 --> 1007.14]  Okay, let's do some Twitter Q&A then guys.
[1007.14 --> 1013.14]  I'm gonna go ahead and switch over to Twitter and 121 new interactions.
[1013.14 --> 1017.14]  My speakers make some kind of strange high-pitched pop every few minutes.
[1017.14 --> 1018.14]  Any idea?
[1018.14 --> 1019.14]  It could be your phone.
[1019.14 --> 1022.14]  If your phone is sitting near your speakers and they're unshielded,
[1022.14 --> 1025.14]  then there's a chance that you'll get some interference from them, from your phone,
[1025.14 --> 1028.14]  whenever it's receiving or sending cellular data.
[1028.14 --> 1031.14]  Yes, we will be covering the THQ bankruptcy soon.
[1031.14 --> 1035.14]  That's actually what Slick's compiling his numbers for.
[1035.14 --> 1036.14]  What's that?
[1036.14 --> 1037.14]  You need a pen?
[1037.14 --> 1039.14]  I have 15 pens you can have.
[1039.14 --> 1040.14]  Ha ha!
[1040.14 --> 1041.14]  Ha!
[1041.14 --> 1042.14]  So funny that one.
[1042.14 --> 1046.14]  I might have one in my pocket.
[1046.14 --> 1048.14]  You can reach in and get it if you want.
[1048.14 --> 1049.14]  Nope, I got nothing.
[1049.14 --> 1050.14]  That's a shame.
[1050.14 --> 1051.14]  So close.
[1051.14 --> 1053.14]  And yet so far.
[1053.14 --> 1059.14]  Do we really not have a single- you know, all the technology in the world and we don't
[1059.14 --> 1061.14]  have a single pen.
[1061.14 --> 1062.14]  It's cool.
[1062.14 --> 1064.14]  You can go to the YouTube forums.
[1064.14 --> 1065.14]  Oh, you're good?
[1065.14 --> 1066.14]  Okay.
[1066.14 --> 1068.14]  I'm doing Twitter Q&A then.
[1068.14 --> 1072.14]  Okay, more Twitter Q&A.
[1072.14 --> 1080.14]  Would you recommend EVGA SR2 or SRX for hardcore editing slash mid-highish end gaming on the side?
[1080.14 --> 1081.14]  Actually, yes.
[1081.14 --> 1091.14]  That is one of the only usage scenarios where I would genuinely recommend an SRX because it is not useful for gaming.
[1091.14 --> 1092.14]  Mark my words.
[1092.14 --> 1099.14]  Slower for gaming than an LGA 1155 platform with a 3570K on it.
[1099.14 --> 1101.14]  Especially if you're overclocking.
[1101.14 --> 1102.14]  So there's that.
[1102.14 --> 1109.14]  But if you can take advantage of all of those cores and all those threads, I mean I'm super stoked to see what an SRX will do with Ivy Bridge E in it.
[1109.14 --> 1110.14]  I want to see one.
[1110.14 --> 1111.14]  Holy crap.
[1111.14 --> 1113.14]  I've never actually been able to work with an SRX in real life.
[1113.14 --> 1114.14]  Really?
[1114.14 --> 1115.14]  No.
[1115.14 --> 1118.14]  The issue for me is there's not many cases or I probably would have bought an SR2.
[1118.14 --> 1119.14]  Can the 900 do it?
[1119.14 --> 1121.14]  Yes, 900D will do it.
[1121.14 --> 1122.14]  But the 900 will not.
[1122.14 --> 1123.14]  That's what I meant.
[1123.14 --> 1130.14]  Remember, the 900D and the 900 are completely different things, much the same way that the 300R and the 300 are different things.
[1130.14 --> 1133.14]  Although, like where did Corsair get this naming strategy from?
[1133.14 --> 1137.14]  They both have 600s, although the Corsairs has a T and N-Tex does not.
[1137.14 --> 1139.14]  What other numbers overlap?
[1139.14 --> 1140.14]  600, do they?
[1140.14 --> 1142.14]  I think they both have a 200.
[1142.14 --> 1143.14]  Is there?
[1143.14 --> 1144.14]  Yeah.
[1144.14 --> 1145.14]  Lowest N-Tex.
[1145.14 --> 1147.14]  Yeah, I think there's a carbide 200 of some sort.
[1147.14 --> 1148.14]  Yeah.
[1148.14 --> 1149.14]  Or something like that.
[1149.14 --> 1150.14]  Yeah.
[1150.14 --> 1151.14]  There you go.
[1151.14 --> 1156.14]  So, Corsair, when they reiterate the 800D and the 900D a couple more times, they'll have
[1156.14 --> 1159.14]  an 1100 as well.
[1159.14 --> 1160.14]  Not really.
[1160.14 --> 1162.14]  Not sure where I was going with this.
[1162.14 --> 1163.14]  Cloud gaming will never fully take over.
[1163.14 --> 1165.14]  There's a reason we're called enthusiasts.
[1165.14 --> 1166.14]  Building computers is a hobby for many.
[1166.14 --> 1168.14]  Good for you, but you're wrong.
[1168.14 --> 1171.14]  Cloud gaming will take over and there will be nothing left of enthusiasts.
[1171.14 --> 1174.14]  There will be old games or like indie games.
[1174.14 --> 1181.14]  It's like saying Super Nintendo is never going to die because there are enthusiasts and it'll
[1181.14 --> 1182.14]  always be there.
[1182.14 --> 1183.14]  And you're right.
[1183.14 --> 1188.14]  In fact, I think the most recent Super Nintendo game was made only a couple years ago or something
[1188.14 --> 1189.14]  like that.
[1189.14 --> 1194.14]  Yeah, there's still guys coding games for Super Nintendo and finding ways to like flash the
[1194.14 --> 1195.14]  ROMs onto cartridges and play them.
[1195.14 --> 1198.14]  And like you said with indie games, there will always be like Kickstarter where they're
[1198.14 --> 1203.14]  going to release and then stretch goals will always be like local platform, local platform.
[1203.14 --> 1204.14]  Yes.
[1204.14 --> 1205.14]  Or right now it's like Linux, Linux, Linux.
[1205.14 --> 1211.14]  So there will always be like that push where there will be a few options for it.
[1211.14 --> 1215.14]  But yeah, it's going away mainstream.
[1215.14 --> 1216.14]  Mark my words.
[1216.14 --> 1222.14]  Ten years from now, you probably won't have any good reason to still have a dedicated gaming
[1222.14 --> 1223.14]  computer.
[1223.14 --> 1226.14]  But there, come on guys.
[1226.14 --> 1229.14]  Okay, here's another thing too is don't worry too much about it.
[1229.14 --> 1233.14]  Because there's going to be lots of stuff to tinker with.
[1233.14 --> 1237.14]  Like there's going to be lots of cool stuff that we can play with as enthusiasts.
[1237.14 --> 1243.14]  I mean that's like saying, you know, oh, you know, the desktop PC is never, never going
[1243.14 --> 1246.14]  away because phones will never take over, rah rah rah.
[1246.14 --> 1252.14]  The reality of it is we all have awesome smartphones that we all use to play games and we all use
[1252.14 --> 1255.14]  to do all kinds of things and they're coexisting.
[1255.14 --> 1256.14]  That's okay.
[1256.14 --> 1261.14]  So your local platform that you play your indie games on or whatever will co-exist but
[1261.14 --> 1263.14]  you will have some kind of a cloud service.
[1263.14 --> 1265.14]  Maybe ten years is optimistic.
[1265.14 --> 1267.14]  Especially for certain countries.
[1267.14 --> 1271.14]  Like I think in places like Japan where infrastructure costs nothing.
[1271.14 --> 1275.14]  In places like Europe where the population density is so high compared to...
[1275.14 --> 1277.14]  How long did you say you think it's going to take?
[1277.14 --> 1278.14]  I said ten years.
[1278.14 --> 1279.14]  I think that's optimistic.
[1279.14 --> 1281.14]  That's like, I think it'll take longer than that.
[1281.14 --> 1282.14]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[1282.14 --> 1283.14]  I'm 100% sure it'll take longer.
[1283.14 --> 1284.14]  Yeah, it'll probably be more like 20.
[1284.14 --> 1285.14]  At least.
[1285.14 --> 1286.14]  Before we actually don't need a little bit of...
[1286.14 --> 1287.14]  It'll be a long time.
[1287.14 --> 1288.14]  So it'll be a long time.
[1288.14 --> 1289.14]  So don't worry.
[1289.14 --> 1292.14]  It'll be a long time and the transition will be smooth.
[1292.14 --> 1293.14]  Well, smoothish.
[1293.14 --> 1294.14]  Nothing's ever smooth.
[1294.14 --> 1295.14]  Nothing ever works.
[1295.14 --> 1297.14]  That's rule number one of Tech Tips.
[1297.14 --> 1299.14]  Thank you for joining us live, Binogh.
[1299.14 --> 1300.14]  Binogh, Binogh.
[1300.14 --> 1301.14]  Binogh.
[1301.14 --> 1304.14]  Please boost to 1080p up from 900p.
[1304.14 --> 1309.14]  I'm tired of seeing people ask what it is.
[1309.14 --> 1314.14]  Please boost to 1080p plus up from 900p.
[1314.14 --> 1315.14]  I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[1315.14 --> 1316.14]  Are we streaming in 900p?
[1316.14 --> 1318.14]  I don't think we're streaming in 900p.
[1318.14 --> 1322.14]  I don't think I can check right now though.
[1322.14 --> 1323.14]  Resolution.
[1323.14 --> 1324.14]  Oh!
[1324.14 --> 1325.14]  What the heck?
[1325.14 --> 1327.14]  We're streaming in 1600x900.
[1327.14 --> 1328.14]  Why are we streaming?
[1328.14 --> 1329.14]  Okay, sorry guys.
[1329.14 --> 1331.14]  There's nothing I can really do right now about that.
[1331.14 --> 1333.14]  The profile must transfer.
[1333.14 --> 1335.14]  Okay, it's all Slick's fault.
[1335.14 --> 1341.14]  Because he was using my Twitch account to test some things when he was streaming some game
[1341.14 --> 1353.14]  last night and his monitor is 1680x1050, which because XSplit's awesome and doesn't acknowledge 1610 resolutions, which I understand.
[1353.14 --> 1354.14]  I understand.
[1354.14 --> 1356.14]  It's a streaming platform for...
[1356.14 --> 1358.14]  I'm getting new monitors.
[1358.14 --> 1360.14]  Slick says he's getting new monitors.
[1360.14 --> 1361.14]  I'll believe it when I see it.
[1361.14 --> 1362.14]  So sorry about that guys.
[1362.14 --> 1368.14]  We will have to deal with that another time.
[1368.14 --> 1371.14]  Australia Day.
[1371.14 --> 1372.14]  Cool.
[1372.14 --> 1373.14]  Watching from the UK.
[1373.14 --> 1374.14]  Awesome.
[1374.14 --> 1376.14]  When will the sweepstakes be over?
[1376.14 --> 1377.14]  You know what?
[1377.14 --> 1380.14]  I haven't talked to Lou from Unbox Therapy any time soon.
[1380.14 --> 1383.14]  Or any time recently.
[1383.14 --> 1387.14]  So hopefully we'll be doing the Gaming Peripherals giveaway very, very soon.
[1387.14 --> 1391.14]  I have them sitting in my waiting to ship stuff out pile over there.
[1391.14 --> 1400.14]  So we'll ship it out as soon as we get together and do a random.org choice for a winner.
[1400.14 --> 1401.14]  So that's good.
[1401.14 --> 1405.14]  TechTeamGB says they saw my My Story post on my forum.
[1405.14 --> 1408.14]  They wondered what I recommend for new reviewers.
[1408.14 --> 1412.14]  I think pretty much everything I have to say is in that post.
[1412.14 --> 1417.14]  If you go on the LinusTechTips.com forum and search for My Story or something like that,
[1417.14 --> 1423.14]  basically I just posted, I've talked about it on the live streams before, so if you've been following for a while then you'll already know.
[1423.14 --> 1434.14]  But I posted sort of how I got into making YouTube videos and how my career has started and sort of continued to evolve.
[1434.14 --> 1438.14]  And Slick is now prepared with our next main topic.
[1438.14 --> 1441.14]  So let's do a few more Twitter Q&A things.
[1441.14 --> 1443.14]  Talk about the diaper video.
[1443.14 --> 1448.14]  I don't know what there is to talk about on the diaper video, but it is what it is.
[1448.14 --> 1450.14]  I mean babies don't really care.
[1450.14 --> 1452.14]  They don't really have any shame.
[1452.14 --> 1459.14]  Have you heard about the 8350 versus 3570 disagreement going on between Logan and some neckbeards?
[1459.14 --> 1460.14]  No, I haven't.
[1460.14 --> 1465.14]  Yeah, he posted a bunch of videos saying that the 8350 beats 3570K.
[1465.14 --> 1466.14]  Oh, well it doesn't.
[1466.14 --> 1467.14]  Yeah, I know.
[1467.14 --> 1468.14]  Oh, okay.
[1468.14 --> 1469.14]  I'm with you.
[1469.14 --> 1470.14]  It's clear.
[1470.14 --> 1478.14]  I haven't actually watched his videos, but I think it's like certain, I think what he's actually trying to say is that it wins in very specific use cases.
[1478.14 --> 1480.14]  Well I saw the title of his video, but I didn't watch it.
[1480.14 --> 1483.14]  It was something to do with Twitch streaming and gaming.
[1483.14 --> 1484.14]  Oh, was it?
[1484.14 --> 1486.14]  I have no idea what he was aiming at.
[1486.14 --> 1514.14]  So if you're in an environment where you actually have a lot of multi-threaded junk going on in the background, like if you have like three people Skyping in and you have windows of them here, here and here, and then you're streaming from the corner while you're playing a game and you're doing like a stream like that where it's very CPU intensive because it's encoding multiple streams, then something like an 8350 could pull ahead of a 3570K.
[1514.14 --> 1515.14]  Cause all them cores.
[1515.14 --> 1516.14]  Cause all them cores.
[1516.14 --> 1518.14]  Yeah, cause all them cores.
[1518.14 --> 1525.14]  But in sort of the, well, in situations that most people would encounter, that's not really going to happen.
[1525.14 --> 1527.14]  Like we just said though, we haven't seen his video.
[1527.14 --> 1528.14]  You should have, yeah.
[1528.14 --> 1529.14]  Hi Winnipeg.
[1529.14 --> 1530.14]  Sorry.
[1530.14 --> 1531.14]  It sucks to be you, man.
[1531.14 --> 1533.14]  You should have Skype callers on your live stream.
[1533.14 --> 1534.14]  You know what?
[1534.14 --> 1543.14]  It's something that we might do at some point with like, you know, having like Diesel join us, for example, but it'll be, it probably won't happen where we'll take actual live viewers as callers.
[1543.14 --> 1547.14]  Cause Twitter is a much more manageable way for us to interact with the audience.
[1547.14 --> 1551.14]  Uh, talk about Intel said they'll stop making desktop CPUs after.
[1551.14 --> 1552.14]  Let's see.
[1552.14 --> 1553.14]  Let's see what they say.
[1553.14 --> 1556.14]  Although actually, okay, before we do that, I have another topic.
[1556.14 --> 1558.14]  Intel is, oh my goodness.
[1558.14 --> 1560.14]  I have two more that are awesome.
[1560.14 --> 1561.14]  Yeah, that one too.
[1561.14 --> 1562.14]  Yeah, that one too.
[1562.14 --> 1565.14]  So let's start with, uh, let's start with Intel.
[1565.14 --> 1567.14]  Uh, it's not going to make desktop boards anymore.
[1567.14 --> 1568.14]  Yup.
[1568.14 --> 1569.14]  Heard about that.
[1569.14 --> 1570.14]  Yup.
[1570.14 --> 1572.14]  They were never that huge in the motherboard market.
[1572.14 --> 1574.14]  In some markets it was different.
[1574.14 --> 1575.14]  Was it?
[1575.14 --> 1576.14]  Yes.
[1576.14 --> 1579.14]  In markets where, cause Intel's strength more than, well, okay.
[1579.14 --> 1580.14]  They're technology.
[1580.14 --> 1583.14]  So technology here, you know, probably branding here.
[1583.14 --> 1587.14]  And then strength number three, I guess if I had to pick one, this is off the top of my head.
[1587.14 --> 1588.14]  So they probably have more strengths.
[1588.14 --> 1593.14]  I mean, Intel's just like, you know, if they had eight arms sticking out of them, they'd all be going like this.
[1593.14 --> 1594.14]  Right.
[1594.14 --> 1596.14]  Um, but their distribution network.
[1596.14 --> 1597.14]  Yeah.
[1597.14 --> 1598.14]  Yeah.
[1598.14 --> 1601.14]  Because you can buy an Intel CPU.
[1601.14 --> 1602.14]  Anywhere.
[1602.14 --> 1603.14]  Anywhere.
[1603.14 --> 1604.14]  Yeah.
[1604.14 --> 1610.14]  So especially years ago when Asus or DFI or Biostar or whatever.
[1610.14 --> 1611.14]  DFI and Biostar, yeah.
[1611.14 --> 1616.14]  Or like markets where Asus didn't have a lot of penetration, very low cost markets.
[1616.14 --> 1623.14]  Intel was actually seen as a premium brand because compared to the other garbage you could buy, Intel was reliable.
[1623.14 --> 1626.14]  It would work every time and that was that.
[1626.14 --> 1629.14]  So Intel actually like is a thing.
[1629.14 --> 1632.14]  Well, it was a thing when it comes to motherboards.
[1632.14 --> 1634.14]  But now that has, that has all changed.
[1634.14 --> 1635.14]  So what does this mean?
[1635.14 --> 1639.14]  I'll take your thoughts first while I adjust the angle of the camera a little bit here cause it's bugging me.
[1639.14 --> 1644.14]  I wonder if they'll be quite so strict on the specification for everything.
[1646.14 --> 1648.14]  Other than that, I don't really think it's that big of a deal.
[1651.14 --> 1652.14]  I don't know.
[1652.14 --> 1653.14]  That's all I have to say.
[1653.14 --> 1655.14]  That's all you have to say about Intel not doing motherboards anymore?
[1655.14 --> 1656.14]  I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[1656.14 --> 1658.14]  I was never even interested in Intel motherboards.
[1658.14 --> 1659.14]  But that's not the point.
[1659.14 --> 1660.14]  What does it mean for the market?
[1660.14 --> 1670.14]  We've consolidated down from, okay here, I'm going to name all the motherboard makers I can think of from when I was an enthusiast at the very beginning.
[1670.14 --> 1671.14]  Okay?
[1671.14 --> 1677.14]  So like, like I'm talking branded motherboard makers where you could actually go to a store or an online website and buy it.
[1677.14 --> 1699.14]  Soyo, ECS, Biostar, Foxconn, Soltech, MSI, ASUS, Gigabyte, EVGA, what are some of the other crazy, chain tech, DFI, what else was there?
[1699.14 --> 1700.14]  Probably missing some.
[1700.14 --> 1702.14]  I'm probably missing a bunch.
[1702.14 --> 1706.14]  But we're now down to, oh Intel, right?
[1706.14 --> 1708.14]  Intel's another one.
[1708.14 --> 1715.14]  I'm sure it's probably blowing up with a whole bunch that we just missed.
[1715.14 --> 1718.14]  But those are pretty much all the ones I remember.
[1718.14 --> 1725.14]  Yeah, so at least a dozen guys existed in the Socket A era.
[1725.14 --> 1731.14]  And one by one, they've gradually just started, a bit, there's another one, a bit.
[1731.14 --> 1732.14]  There's 13.
[1732.14 --> 1734.14]  That's happened with everything though.
[1734.14 --> 1735.14]  Every single piece.
[1735.14 --> 1736.14]  Consolidation.
[1736.14 --> 1742.14]  So 13 I can name from when I was actually, I don't know if I can count EVGA because I don't think they overlapped with Soltech.
[1742.14 --> 1745.14]  So let's say at least 12 active ones at a time.
[1745.14 --> 1751.14]  So now we're down, without Intel, we're down to, oh, ASRock's another one.
[1751.14 --> 1752.14]  14.
[1752.14 --> 1753.14]  Of course, yeah.
[1753.14 --> 1754.14]  ASRock.
[1754.14 --> 1755.14]  So lots of guys.
[1755.14 --> 1760.14]  So now we're down to ASUS Gigabyte as like a clear 1-2.
[1760.14 --> 1763.14]  Then MSI as a clear number 3.
[1763.14 --> 1772.14]  And then ASRock, which who may or may not, there was a rumor that ASUS is going to reacquire ASRock because that's ASRock's origin.
[1772.14 --> 1774.14]  So that would leave us with 3.
[1774.14 --> 1775.14]  Intel will be gone.
[1775.14 --> 1778.14]  Biostar and ECS are still out there, but they're just making low on stuff.
[1778.14 --> 1780.14]  And I can tell you the margins are not good.
[1780.14 --> 1783.14]  Like it just won't make any sense at some point.
[1783.14 --> 1786.14]  And they'll just abandon making standalone boards.
[1786.14 --> 1788.14]  EVGA is still making motherboards.
[1788.14 --> 1793.14]  EVGA is still making motherboards, but I know that their volumes are not as high as someone like ASUS.
[1793.14 --> 1794.14]  Of course not.
[1794.14 --> 1798.14]  And the margin's not there because they have to get someone else to make it for them.
[1798.14 --> 1802.14]  Like whether it's Foxconn or ASUS or Gigabyte or whoever else.
[1802.14 --> 1805.14]  EVGA is not a manufacturer of motherboards.
[1805.14 --> 1810.14]  So that leaves us with what, maybe six guys that are still active now?
[1810.14 --> 1814.14]  I mean, that's happened with everything though, seriously.
[1814.14 --> 1816.14]  There's still a lot of video card guys.
[1816.14 --> 1818.14]  Yeah, but quite a few of them have fallen too.
[1818.14 --> 1819.14]  Still a lot of peripheral guys.
[1819.14 --> 1821.14]  If anything, there's probably more peripheral guys.
[1821.14 --> 1822.14]  Peripheral, yeah.
[1822.14 --> 1823.14]  Peripherals is, yeah.
[1823.14 --> 1826.14]  Monitors, still lots, although there might have been more.
[1826.14 --> 1829.14]  Look at gaming studios looking at our next topic.
[1829.14 --> 1830.14]  Yep.
[1830.14 --> 1832.14]  Gaming studios that has happened like crazy.
[1832.14 --> 1834.14]  Look at the volume of just EA.
[1834.14 --> 1840.14]  Look at what they've eaten and consumed and destroyed and left dead.
[1840.14 --> 1842.14]  Well, they don't leave everything dead.
[1842.14 --> 1843.14]  EA has good stuff.
[1843.14 --> 1845.14]  The Sims is kind of awesome.
[1845.14 --> 1847.14]  Wasn't that originally their title?
[1847.14 --> 1848.14]  Yeah.
[1848.14 --> 1849.14]  Yeah.
[1849.14 --> 1850.14]  No.
[1850.14 --> 1853.14]  Um, NHL 2013.
[1853.14 --> 1854.14]  Wasn't that originally their title?
[1854.14 --> 1855.14]  Which almost didn't happen.
[1855.14 --> 1857.14]  Wasn't that originally their title?
[1857.14 --> 1861.14]  Who have they consumed that it's like, came out well?
[1861.14 --> 1862.14]  Yeah.
[1862.14 --> 1863.14]  Oh.
[1863.14 --> 1876.14]  Because I think they were working on, uh, Mass Effect 1 when they acquired BioWare.
[1876.14 --> 1879.14]  And I think they were working on Dragon Age 1.
[1879.14 --> 1883.14]  So those games were released more from just BioWare's standpoint.
[1883.14 --> 1884.14]  And then Dragon Age 2 came out.
[1884.14 --> 1886.14]  I know you haven't played it, but like, whoa.
[1886.14 --> 1887.14]  I bought it.
[1887.14 --> 1888.14]  Was it bad?
[1888.14 --> 1889.14]  Ugh.
[1889.14 --> 1890.14]  I hated that game.
[1890.14 --> 1892.14]  Loved Dragon Age 1.
[1892.14 --> 1893.14]  Did not like Dragon Age 2.
[1893.14 --> 1894.14]  You can't go anywhere.
[1894.14 --> 1898.14]  It's just like, oh, I got to the main city and I'm just in the main city.
[1898.14 --> 1902.14]  Any quests that are outside the main city I get to teleport to and then teleport back.
[1902.14 --> 1903.14]  Sweet.
[1903.14 --> 1904.14]  That's so, ugh.
[1904.14 --> 1905.14]  So boring.
[1905.14 --> 1910.14]  I mean, for me, one of the best parts of any kind of an RPG style game is getting to
[1910.14 --> 1914.14]  the next town and like finding all the weird random stuff.
[1914.14 --> 1915.14]  Yep.
[1915.14 --> 1921.14]  Like the chicken that you can throw down a hole or whatever in Zelda or in like, or like,
[1921.14 --> 1925.14]  or like the house that you go into in Final Fantasy 6 where the music's different so you
[1925.14 --> 1927.14]  know there's going to be like a kooky old man in there.
[1927.14 --> 1929.14]  The chicken at the very beginning of Skyrim.
[1929.14 --> 1933.14]  You run up and hit it and a whole town freaking goes crazy on you.
[1933.14 --> 1935.14]  Like, like just awesome little things.
[1935.14 --> 1936.14]  Like that's so cool.
[1936.14 --> 1937.14]  Mass Effect.
[1937.14 --> 1941.14]  Uh, and Mass Effect 3 came out and my brother and I were both like, oh, we haven't played
[1941.14 --> 1942.14]  Mass Effect series at all.
[1942.14 --> 1946.14]  Let's not read anything because everyone hated Mass Effect 3.
[1946.14 --> 1950.14]  But we just refused to read anything because we were like, we'll catch up, right?
[1950.14 --> 1951.14]  Both played Mass Effect 1.
[1951.14 --> 1953.14]  Both absolutely loved it.
[1953.14 --> 1954.14]  Awesome game.
[1954.14 --> 1955.14]  Loved that game.
[1955.14 --> 1956.14]  It was great.
[1956.14 --> 1957.14]  Picked up Mass Effect 2.
[1957.14 --> 1958.14]  I'm playing on PC.
[1958.14 --> 1960.14]  I quit in like 15 minutes.
[1960.14 --> 1961.14]  That's it?
[1961.14 --> 1967.14]  They, they put everything on, like you can tell it was hardcore made for a controller.
[1967.14 --> 1971.14]  And if you go into the key bindings to rebind things, it's like, oh yeah, rebind three
[1971.14 --> 1973.14]  moves onto one button on your keyboard.
[1973.14 --> 1974.14]  What?
[1974.14 --> 1978.14]  Like, no, I don't want, like, I don't remember them all, but it's like jump and open and like
[1978.14 --> 1980.14]  do this other thing all in my space bar.
[1980.14 --> 1984.14]  It's like, no, use is E. What are you doing?
[1984.14 --> 1986.14]  Like, use can be F.
[1986.14 --> 1988.14]  Or F. Or whatever.
[1988.14 --> 1990.14]  Like you can bind it to whatever you want, right?
[1990.14 --> 1991.14]  Could be U.
[1991.14 --> 1994.14]  Wow.
[1994.14 --> 1996.14]  You know what I mean?
[1996.14 --> 1997.14]  Yes.
[1997.14 --> 2000.14]  Like being able to key bind specific abilities is like kind of important.
[2000.14 --> 2002.14]  And they put it all on single buttons and I was just like, screw this.
[2002.14 --> 2005.14]  You know what I love about like proper PC games?
[2005.14 --> 2006.14]  Like Quake 3.
[2006.14 --> 2007.14]  Okay.
[2007.14 --> 2008.14]  Awesome.
[2008.14 --> 2012.14]  When I got a widescreen monitor, I was like, okay, go into the INI file.
[2012.14 --> 2015.14]  Key in a value for field of view.
[2015.14 --> 2016.14]  It's just like bloop.
[2016.14 --> 2018.14]  Key in a value for resolution.
[2018.14 --> 2019.14]  Done.
[2019.14 --> 2021.14]  It doesn't matter how old and crappy it is.
[2021.14 --> 2026.14]  If the game developer actually properly makes it customizable, it can't be that much work.
[2026.14 --> 2028.14]  They just port and forget.
[2028.14 --> 2030.14]  How much work is it?
[2030.14 --> 2031.14]  I'm actually...
[2031.14 --> 2033.14]  Like it's like built in benchmarking utilities.
[2033.14 --> 2036.14]  How much work is it to record a stupid time demo?
[2036.14 --> 2037.14]  Come on!
[2037.14 --> 2045.14]  Like how much publicity does a game developer who produces a benchmark for their game get
[2045.14 --> 2049.14]  from everyone, everywhere benchmarking their game?
[2049.14 --> 2055.14]  Like what was that game where the benchmark was like the big monster that comes out and
[2055.14 --> 2056.14]  like does stuff?
[2056.14 --> 2061.14]  I'm not going to be able to think of it.
[2061.14 --> 2063.14]  I can't think of it either.
[2063.14 --> 2067.14]  We should like segue from that and talk about whether or not people want those videos.
[2067.14 --> 2068.14]  Lost Planet 2.
[2068.14 --> 2069.14]  Was that it?
[2069.14 --> 2070.14]  Yeah, that was the one.
[2070.14 --> 2071.14]  Lost Planet 2.
[2071.14 --> 2074.14]  It's like I wouldn't have even considered playing that game because I just didn't care
[2074.14 --> 2076.14]  and didn't have the time around that time.
[2076.14 --> 2077.14]  But then there's a benchmark.
[2077.14 --> 2078.14]  But there's a benchmark.
[2078.14 --> 2081.14]  So you see it on every review site for every video card.
[2081.14 --> 2084.14]  And if your benchmark looks good enough, which it should, then you can see it on every video
[2084.14 --> 2087.14]  and it looks cool, I want to play that game.
[2087.14 --> 2089.14]  Super easy to get super easy advertising.
[2089.14 --> 2090.14]  How much work is that?
[2090.14 --> 2091.14]  Anyway, you know what?
[2091.14 --> 2095.14]  Before we go on to the THQ acquisition, what's that?
[2095.14 --> 2098.14]  We should talk about benchmarking video if people actually want it.
[2098.14 --> 2099.14]  Okay, right.
[2099.14 --> 2100.14]  The Far Cry 3 one.
[2100.14 --> 2101.14]  Okay.
[2101.14 --> 2105.14]  Let's take some, let's go have a look at Twitter really quick here to see if anyone was
[2105.14 --> 2110.14]  able to come up with anything that EA hasn't wrecked.
[2110.14 --> 2113.14]  Here we go.
[2113.14 --> 2116.14]  Yeah, same experience as Slick playing Mass Effect 2.
[2116.14 --> 2119.14]  He kept playing though because Garrus was sexy.
[2119.14 --> 2121.14]  Garrus is pretty awesome.
[2121.14 --> 2123.14]  Slick's in agreement with you if you can't hear him.
[2123.14 --> 2125.14]  I know the shotgun mic's pretty directional.
[2125.14 --> 2126.14]  Sorry I'm late.
[2126.14 --> 2129.14]  Was installing a passive VGA cooler on my 6870.
[2129.14 --> 2130.14]  Good luck with that.
[2130.14 --> 2131.14]  I hope you have some airflow.
[2131.14 --> 2136.14]  Logan attributed two unreleased Windows 7 updates for the reason why 8350 pulled ahead?
[2136.14 --> 2137.14]  No.
[2137.14 --> 2140.14]  I think you should check out Singularity Computers.
[2140.14 --> 2141.14]  He's a custom builder.
[2141.14 --> 2142.14]  Okay.
[2142.14 --> 2143.14]  What about Texas Instruments?
[2143.14 --> 2145.14]  No, they were never in motherboards.
[2145.14 --> 2146.14]  Should try Firefall.
[2146.14 --> 2148.14]  It's free for two days.
[2148.14 --> 2150.14]  Wish I had time.
[2150.14 --> 2154.14]  I'm going to go in and do other things like work when I'm done this.
[2154.14 --> 2157.14]  My 13 year old friend is getting a gaming PC and wants an i7.
[2157.14 --> 2159.14]  Could you convince him he doesn't need an i7?
[2159.14 --> 2160.14]  He doesn't need one.
[2160.14 --> 2162.14]  An i7's not a bad idea.
[2162.14 --> 2163.14]  Send them at the forums.
[2163.14 --> 2166.14]  Get them to go into the building planning group.
[2166.14 --> 2167.14]  Yep.
[2167.14 --> 2168.14]  Those guys are really good.
[2168.14 --> 2169.14]  They know what they're doing.
[2169.14 --> 2170.14]  Send them to linustechtips.com.
[2170.14 --> 2172.14]  We are streaming on the XA10.
[2172.14 --> 2173.14]  Hi from the UK.
[2173.14 --> 2174.14]  Hello.
[2174.14 --> 2175.14]  Hey.
[2175.14 --> 2176.14]  Hello.
[2176.14 --> 2177.14]  Agreed.
[2177.14 --> 2179.14]  Exploration for the win.
[2179.14 --> 2181.14]  Yes, sir or ma'am.
[2181.14 --> 2182.14]  Zachary.
[2182.14 --> 2183.14]  Probably not in check.
[2183.14 --> 2184.14]  How many gigahertz can I get?
[2184.14 --> 2185.14]  I don't know.
[2185.14 --> 2186.14]  Go for it.
[2186.14 --> 2187.14]  Find out.
[2187.14 --> 2188.14]  That's half the fun.
[2188.14 --> 2189.14]  Yeah.
[2189.14 --> 2192.14]  They probably manufactured their own boards at some point but I was talking branded motherboards.
[2192.14 --> 2195.14]  And he was talking when he was into it very specifically.
[2195.14 --> 2196.14]  Yeah.
[2196.14 --> 2199.14]  But like branded in a retail box marked with the brand.
[2199.14 --> 2200.14]  Zotac and Foxconn.
[2200.14 --> 2201.14]  That's right.
[2201.14 --> 2204.14]  Zotac does still make motherboards although it's very niche.
[2204.14 --> 2205.14]  Like very niche.
[2205.14 --> 2208.14]  I mean I also wasn't talking about Supermicro and Tyan either.
[2208.14 --> 2211.14]  So Zotac is basically just ITX boards.
[2211.14 --> 2217.14]  So when my comp sleeps at Undetects the storage drive I have to restart to be able to play
[2217.14 --> 2218.14]  games.
[2218.14 --> 2221.14]  We're having a similar issue with our benchmarking platform which is using an iSCSI disk.
[2221.14 --> 2223.14]  That's a little bit different because it's an iSCSI disk though.
[2223.14 --> 2224.14]  Yeah it's sort of different.
[2224.14 --> 2225.14]  Okay.
[2225.14 --> 2226.14]  Any update on the build?
[2226.14 --> 2228.14]  I'm waiting for Mountain Mods to ship me back my stuff.
[2228.14 --> 2231.14]  I want to put an octua fans in my build but I don't like the color.
[2231.14 --> 2233.14]  Any good way to paint it and will it affect performance?
[2233.14 --> 2237.14]  Painting it will affect the balance and could even affect the shape slightly.
[2237.14 --> 2239.14]  Paint is not insignificant.
[2239.14 --> 2241.14]  It does have thickness.
[2241.14 --> 2245.14]  If I was really going to go all out and I was going to really try to put an octua fans
[2245.14 --> 2249.14]  in a system I would try and figure out some way to dye the plastic.
[2249.14 --> 2253.14]  Because that's probably a better way to do it without adding any weight or any bulk or
[2253.14 --> 2260.14]  any uh or affecting the balance because balance is everything with a high quality fan.
[2260.14 --> 2261.14]  Have you ever actually done that though?
[2261.14 --> 2262.14]  No.
[2262.14 --> 2263.14]  Or heard of anyone doing that?
[2263.14 --> 2264.14]  No.
[2264.14 --> 2265.14]  Because how would you dye it properly?
[2265.14 --> 2266.14]  How would you dye it plastic?
[2266.14 --> 2268.14]  No because the motor's in there.
[2268.14 --> 2271.14]  If you dye it you'd have to put like some kind of a waterproof thing.
[2271.14 --> 2272.14]  That would be hard.
[2272.14 --> 2273.14]  That would be really cool.
[2273.14 --> 2274.14]  That would be a cool mod though.
[2274.14 --> 2275.14]  Yeah.
[2275.14 --> 2276.14]  Black noctua fans like custom made.
[2276.14 --> 2277.14]  That would be sick.
[2277.14 --> 2279.14]  Because I love noctuas but they only work in systems like that.
[2279.14 --> 2281.14]  Like they're, I guess you can't see it.
[2281.14 --> 2282.14]  They can't see that.
[2282.14 --> 2283.14]  Green C70.
[2283.14 --> 2284.14]  It looks really military.
[2284.14 --> 2285.14]  It looks really cool.
[2285.14 --> 2287.14]  Throw a saber tooth in there and it just looks awesome.
[2287.14 --> 2289.14]  So the next live stream set up is a Canon XA10.
[2289.14 --> 2291.14]  We've got a Rode shotgun mic on it.
[2291.14 --> 2295.14]  Um, we're streaming to a Blackmagic Intensity Pro capture card.
[2295.14 --> 2302.14]  We're using XSplit and we've got a 3770 with like 8 gigs of RAM as our streaming computer.
[2302.14 --> 2304.14]  Running on onboard video.
[2304.14 --> 2305.14]  Watching from SA.
[2305.14 --> 2306.14]  Where's SA?
[2306.14 --> 2307.14]  South Arizona?
[2307.14 --> 2308.14]  I think there's probably more than one SA.
[2308.14 --> 2309.14]  San Antonio?
[2309.14 --> 2310.14]  And we have fans from around the world.
[2310.14 --> 2311.14]  South Africa?
[2311.14 --> 2312.14]  South America?
[2312.14 --> 2313.14]  Shout out to all of those places.
[2313.14 --> 2314.14]  Hello everybody.
[2314.14 --> 2315.14]  Um, uh, there'll probably be a new chip side.
[2315.14 --> 2317.14]  It'll probably be like Z87 or something.
[2317.14 --> 2318.14]  I know I'm going out on a limb there.
[2318.14 --> 2319.14]  Whoa Linus!
[2319.14 --> 2320.14]  Calm down!
[2320.14 --> 2321.14]  That was creative.
[2321.14 --> 2322.14]  Oh yeah.
[2322.14 --> 2323.14]  Also in the snow.
[2323.14 --> 2324.14]  Yes snow!
[2324.14 --> 2325.14]  Shout out to you too.
[2325.14 --> 2326.14]  Editing dual...
[2326.14 --> 2327.14]  Aha!
[2327.14 --> 2328.14]  Dual...
[2328.14 --> 2329.14]  Well neither!
[2329.14 --> 2330.14]  Editing, you don't need either of those things.
[2330.14 --> 2331.14]  You need one CUDA capable core.
[2331.14 --> 2334.14]  And if you don't need to be able to get into the same thing, you need one CUDA capable
[2334.14 --> 2335.14]  core.
[2335.14 --> 2336.14]  And if you don't need to be able to get into it, you don't need to be able to get into it.
[2336.14 --> 2337.14]  It's a big deal.
[2337.14 --> 2338.14]  Thank you.
[2338.14 --> 2340.14]  So, for the reason why I'm going out on a limb here.
[2340.14 --> 2341.14]  I'm so excited.
[2341.14 --> 2342.14]  I'm so excited.
[2342.14 --> 2343.14]  I'm so excited.
[2343.14 --> 2344.14]  I'm so excited.
[2344.14 --> 2345.14]  I'm so excited.
[2345.14 --> 2346.14]  I'm so excited.
[2346.14 --> 2347.14]  I'm so excited.
[2347.14 --> 2348.14]  I'm so excited.
[2348.14 --> 2350.14]  What is the CUDA capable core?
[2350.14 --> 2353.14]  And preferably a Quadro if you're using Premiere Pro.
[2353.14 --> 2354.14]  PC chips.
[2354.14 --> 2355.14]  Ah yes!
[2355.14 --> 2356.14]  PC chips!
[2356.14 --> 2357.14]  There you go.
[2357.14 --> 2358.14]  That's another one.
[2358.14 --> 2359.14]  Motherboard manufacturer.
[2359.14 --> 2360.14]  I've never dealt with them.
[2360.14 --> 2361.14]  Low end stuff.
[2361.14 --> 2362.14]  Okay.
[2362.14 --> 2364.14]  What temperature is dangerous for laptops internal hardware?
[2364.14 --> 2368.14]  I'd say anything above 80 to 85 degrees is probably getting into not too comfortable
[2368.14 --> 2369.14]  zone.
[2369.14 --> 2372.14]  Laptops are usually pretty well...like they know what they're building.
[2372.14 --> 2373.14]  They're usually cooled enough.
[2373.14 --> 2375.14]  No updates on the Intel smartphones.
[2375.14 --> 2377.14]  We did talk about them a little bit at CES.
[2377.14 --> 2382.14]  The one thing that the guys in the booth did mention to us though was that especially
[2382.14 --> 2387.14]  the lower cost one was aimed more at developing markets and not so much as a North American
[2387.14 --> 2388.14]  thing.
[2388.14 --> 2390.14]  So it's got like good performance but quite inexpensive.
[2390.14 --> 2395.14]  So they were aiming to get smartphones down to sort of a few hundred dollar price point.
[2395.14 --> 2400.14]  Again, utilizing what you're talking about with the distribution networks.
[2400.14 --> 2403.14]  They know where they can push so might as well.
[2403.14 --> 2404.14]  Mm-hmm.
[2406.14 --> 2412.14]  Speaking of phones, I have officially switched to an HTC 8X.
[2412.14 --> 2418.14]  I'm running Windows 8 phone 24-7 and I'm going to do it for at least 30 days before I decide
[2418.14 --> 2420.14]  whether I'm going back to iOS.
[2420.14 --> 2422.14]  And how's that going for you so far?
[2422.14 --> 2423.14]  Mm-hmm.
[2423.14 --> 2424.14]  I have a list of frustrations actually.
[2424.14 --> 2430.14]  Maybe tomorrow or Monday we should film part 2 of my I Switched blog.
[2430.14 --> 2433.14]  So you can check it out on the Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel if you haven't seen it already.
[2433.14 --> 2439.14]  I did a day one one where I went through and everything that bothered me on day one or everything
[2439.14 --> 2441.14]  I thought was cool on day one is all in there.
[2441.14 --> 2446.14]  And then I have a huge list of notes that's going to make up the next couple videos where
[2446.14 --> 2449.14]  I'm just going to be sort of everything that happened before day three and everything that
[2449.14 --> 2453.14]  happened between kind of day three and day 15 and then I'll probably do one more at the
[2453.14 --> 2458.14]  end of 30 days where I let you guys know based on my experience am I going to switch back
[2458.14 --> 2462.14]  to iOS or am I going to stick with Windows Phone 8.
[2462.14 --> 2466.14]  I'm not going Android for all of you who are about to suggest that I buy a Galaxy S3.
[2466.14 --> 2468.14]  He refused to try it.
[2468.14 --> 2473.14]  He grabbed Windows Phone 8 which is like still being developed for pretty hardcore because
[2473.14 --> 2478.14]  it's like oh I've seen his list of notes and there's a lot of stuff that's just like
[2478.14 --> 2480.14]  really like the auto rotate thing.
[2480.14 --> 2482.14]  Yeah that one's pretty frustrating.
[2482.14 --> 2488.14]  You cannot cannot turn off auto rotate on Windows 8 Windows Phone 8 and I'm not wrong.
[2488.14 --> 2492.14]  I can hear you all rushing to your keyboards and Googling it.
[2492.14 --> 2496.14]  Windows Phone 8 does not support disabling auto rotate.
[2496.14 --> 2501.14]  So if you're using the phone in bed and you want to use it in portrait mode you cannot do that.
[2501.14 --> 2503.14]  It will switch to landscape mode on you.
[2503.14 --> 2507.14]  So then you'll flip it again and it'll go back to portrait mode and then you'll flip it
[2507.14 --> 2512.14]  again and you'll end up in this endless cycle of flipping the phone around not knowing what's
[2512.14 --> 2514.14]  going on and what's up and what's down.
[2514.14 --> 2517.14]  For people that tuned in last week my keyboard works.
[2517.14 --> 2518.14]  That was weird.
[2518.14 --> 2523.14]  The cable completely broke like it doesn't work on anything else and the driver got messed
[2523.14 --> 2525.14]  up at the exact same time.
[2525.14 --> 2528.14]  So it's probably to do with the broken cable.
[2528.14 --> 2529.14]  Like food barring things up.
[2529.14 --> 2530.14]  Maybe.
[2530.14 --> 2531.14]  Yeah.
[2531.14 --> 2534.14]  So I had to pitch that cable and uninstall the driver.
[2534.14 --> 2536.14]  And he stole my cable.
[2536.14 --> 2537.14]  I stole your cable.
[2537.14 --> 2538.14]  I gave it back.
[2538.14 --> 2539.14]  Did you give my cable back?
[2539.14 --> 2540.14]  Yeah.
[2540.14 --> 2541.14]  Okay cause I was going to have to charge you for that.
[2541.14 --> 2542.14]  I'm using the...
[2542.14 --> 2543.14]  Free Dalrah!
[2543.14 --> 2548.14]  I'm using the detachable cable from my Quickfire because the Quickfire's detachable cable is
[2548.14 --> 2549.14]  awesome.
[2549.14 --> 2553.14]  It's like sleeved and golden tipped and just sweet.
[2553.14 --> 2556.14]  So I just shoved it on my ducky and I'm good to go now.
[2556.14 --> 2557.14]  Alright.
[2557.14 --> 2558.14]  You know what?
[2558.14 --> 2559.14]  I want to talk...
[2559.14 --> 2561.14]  Let's talk more consolidation before we do this one.
[2561.14 --> 2562.14]  Okay.
[2562.14 --> 2565.14]  Well we didn't get any EA answers because I think we scrolled down.
[2565.14 --> 2566.14]  Oh yeah.
[2566.14 --> 2567.14]  Did anyone actually manage to...
[2567.14 --> 2570.14]  You asked a question and then you clicked on the comments right away so no one had time
[2570.14 --> 2571.14]  to answer it.
[2571.14 --> 2572.14]  Oh okay.
[2572.14 --> 2575.14]  Intel doesn't make money but I hope they still do Nix.
[2575.14 --> 2578.14]  Logan, Linus says you're wrong about the 8350.
[2578.14 --> 2585.14]  We have done a fair bit of testing on that and like I said, if he's in a particular
[2585.14 --> 2589.14]  scenario, and maybe Far Cry 3 is an exception.
[2589.14 --> 2591.14]  Maybe we should do Far Cry 3 testing.
[2591.14 --> 2593.14]  So hold off guys.
[2593.14 --> 2594.14]  Don't sort of...
[2594.14 --> 2599.14]  He's wrong in the context of most games and anything we've ever tested.
[2599.14 --> 2602.14]  But if he's found a scenario where the 8350 comes out ahead...
[2602.14 --> 2604.14]  We haven't seen his video.
[2604.14 --> 2605.14]  Yes.
[2605.14 --> 2606.14]  So there.
[2606.14 --> 2607.14]  That's a factor.
[2607.14 --> 2609.14]  We can't actually say he's wrong because we haven't seen his video.
[2609.14 --> 2612.14]  Slick, your thoughts on the Elder Scrolls MMO while I eat?
[2612.14 --> 2615.14]  I'm excited and very very fearful at the same time.
[2615.14 --> 2616.14]  Okay.
[2616.14 --> 2619.14]  If none of you guys know, they released a beta sign up.
[2619.14 --> 2625.14]  I've been like too nervous to write the ridiculous essay that I'm going to write for why I should be chosen for this beta.
[2625.14 --> 2631.14]  I'm actually going to sit down tomorrow for like an hour or two and like properly script the whole thing.
[2631.14 --> 2632.14]  How do you have time for this?
[2632.14 --> 2634.14]  And I know you're really really good at like...
[2635.14 --> 2637.14]  Like you took English in university.
[2637.14 --> 2638.14]  So I'm probably going to send it to you.
[2638.14 --> 2639.14]  Oh I didn't.
[2639.14 --> 2640.14]  I thought you took English.
[2640.14 --> 2641.14]  I skipped it.
[2641.14 --> 2642.14]  Anyways.
[2642.14 --> 2647.14]  I know you're good at that kind of write up.
[2647.14 --> 2649.14]  So I'm going to send it to you when I'm done to edit it.
[2649.14 --> 2651.14]  And I'll get you to edit it somehow.
[2651.14 --> 2653.14]  I hate you.
[2653.14 --> 2654.14]  You're fired.
[2654.14 --> 2655.14]  And then I'm going to hand that in.
[2655.14 --> 2659.14]  I'm super freaking stoked and scared as hell at the same time.
[2659.14 --> 2664.14]  Because some of the stuff that I've read has been like, oh god you're going to destroy everything.
[2664.14 --> 2668.14]  But then later on they're like, hey we listened to our fans and changed it.
[2668.14 --> 2671.14]  So it could... they're actually listening.
[2671.14 --> 2673.14]  And like I've seen quite a few videos.
[2673.14 --> 2678.14]  If you check out the interview videos and stuff, they're like, hey we go on this forum, we go on this forum, we go on this forum.
[2678.14 --> 2685.14]  We read everything that gets posted under these forums on these specific like sticky topics and stuff.
[2685.14 --> 2688.14]  We read everything and they pay attention to what people are saying.
[2688.14 --> 2691.14]  So they have been fixing things that are like, holy crap that's bad.
[2691.14 --> 2694.14]  So I'm actually really excited.
[2694.14 --> 2699.14]  I've been a huge fan of every single Elder Scrolls game ever.
[2699.14 --> 2702.14]  Morrowind is like by far and large.
[2702.14 --> 2704.14]  Way above everything else in my list of favorite games.
[2704.14 --> 2705.14]  That's not a thing.
[2705.14 --> 2706.14]  Nothing is far and large.
[2706.14 --> 2709.14]  If it was far and large, then that's the same as it being close and normal.
[2709.14 --> 2713.14]  No, because what if it's like a skyscraper?
[2713.14 --> 2715.14]  It can be far and large and close and large.
[2717.14 --> 2718.14]  Touché.
[2719.14 --> 2723.14]  Anyways, it is by far and large.
[2725.14 --> 2726.14]  My personal favorite game ever.
[2726.14 --> 2730.14]  My list of games that I just absolutely love and Morrowind just completely trump cards.
[2730.14 --> 2732.14]  You've also never played any of my favorite games.
[2732.14 --> 2734.14]  Final Fantasy 6, TIE Fighter.
[2734.14 --> 2735.14]  I haven't played Final Fantasy 6.
[2735.14 --> 2736.14]  I haven't played TIE Fighter.
[2736.14 --> 2737.14]  I will.
[2737.14 --> 2738.14]  I will go back and play them.
[2738.14 --> 2741.14]  I seriously doubt they will beat Morrowind though.
[2741.14 --> 2742.14]  Yeah, probably not.
[2742.14 --> 2743.14]  Probably not.
[2743.14 --> 2749.14]  One of my spring breaks in high school, I spent pretty much the entire duration on the couch
[2749.14 --> 2751.14]  in front of my TV playing Morrowind.
[2751.14 --> 2752.14]  Almost the entire time.
[2752.14 --> 2754.14]  I love that game.
[2754.14 --> 2759.14]  And I've said my story before about figuring out the main quest, so I'm not going to bother
[2759.14 --> 2760.14]  to repeat that.
[2760.14 --> 2761.14]  But yeah, amazing.
[2761.14 --> 2764.14]  I'm stoked for Elder Scrolls MMO, but like I just said, I'm worried too.
[2764.14 --> 2765.14]  So I hope it comes out well.
[2765.14 --> 2766.14]  I think it will come out well.
[2766.14 --> 2767.14]  But...
[2767.14 --> 2769.14]  It's probably about time for a changing of the guard.
[2769.14 --> 2770.14]  I mean, what do we have?
[2770.14 --> 2774.14]  Guild Wars 2, Warcraft the 16th, or whatever expansion pack they're on now.
[2774.14 --> 2776.14]  Okay, I was going to say expansion.
[2776.14 --> 2777.14]  Yeah.
[2777.14 --> 2778.14]  Still technically the same one.
[2778.14 --> 2779.14]  Yeah, but come on.
[2779.14 --> 2783.14]  I mean, it's such a different game compared to what it was when it launched.
[2783.14 --> 2784.14]  Completely.
[2784.14 --> 2785.14]  Yeah.
[2785.14 --> 2786.14]  It's ridiculous.
[2786.14 --> 2787.14]  Well, but that's good.
[2787.14 --> 2788.14]  That's probably what's kept it fresh.
[2788.14 --> 2791.14]  That's probably what's kept subscribers too, because at the beginning it was...
[2791.14 --> 2792.14]  It actually...
[2792.14 --> 2794.14]  Oh, people might hate me for this.
[2794.14 --> 2797.14]  I think at the beginning it was a little bit more hardcore.
[2797.14 --> 2800.14]  And at the beginning you had to have a 40-man raid group to do raids.
[2800.14 --> 2803.14]  So you needed this like huge network of people.
[2803.14 --> 2805.14]  All the servers were self-contained.
[2805.14 --> 2807.14]  At the very beginning there was no battlegrounds.
[2807.14 --> 2808.14]  So all...
[2808.14 --> 2810.14]  I don't even know what a battleground is, so...
[2810.14 --> 2814.14]  Like there's like a capture the flag one, and there's like a whole king of the...
[2814.14 --> 2815.14]  Never mind.
[2815.14 --> 2817.14]  Anyways, at the beginning you needed 40 people if you wanted to raid.
[2817.14 --> 2818.14]  There was world PvP.
[2818.14 --> 2819.14]  That was it.
[2819.14 --> 2822.14]  And it's all contained on your own server.
[2822.14 --> 2825.14]  So you knew like all the top guilds on your server.
[2825.14 --> 2827.14]  You knew like the top dudes of the top guilds on your server.
[2827.14 --> 2830.14]  Because there's only like three really big guilds on the server.
[2830.14 --> 2831.14]  So you know everyone.
[2831.14 --> 2833.14]  When you go into PvP, if it's...
[2833.14 --> 2834.14]  You know the guys you're fighting.
[2834.14 --> 2838.14]  And like it's very possible that you've been in Vent with them before, even if they're on the other side.
[2838.14 --> 2840.14]  People don't even use Vent that much anymore.
[2840.14 --> 2841.14]  It's Skype now.
[2841.14 --> 2842.14]  Anyways.
[2842.14 --> 2843.14]  Um...
[2843.14 --> 2844.14]  Like you knew everyone.
[2844.14 --> 2846.14]  Now it's massively across server.
[2846.14 --> 2850.14]  And now when you look for an instance, you just like click a button and click join.
[2850.14 --> 2851.14]  And a timer goes.
[2851.14 --> 2853.14]  And then once it finds enough people, it's just like join instance.
[2853.14 --> 2856.14]  And you join in with people from other servers and stuff, and you just leave when you're done.
[2856.14 --> 2860.14]  So there's no like communication really like there used to be.
[2860.14 --> 2861.14]  So it's more mainstream.
[2861.14 --> 2862.14]  Way more mainstream.
[2862.14 --> 2863.14]  It's kind of weird.
[2863.14 --> 2865.14]  I don't know.
[2865.14 --> 2869.14]  I come from EverQuest days, so new MMOs are just kind of icky to me.
[2869.14 --> 2870.14]  I don't know.
[2870.14 --> 2871.14]  I don't know.
[2871.14 --> 2872.14]  Uh, what else we got?
[2872.14 --> 2874.14]  But I'm still stoked for the Skyrim one.
[2874.14 --> 2875.14]  Or, whoa!
[2875.14 --> 2876.14]  Elder Scrolls one.
[2876.14 --> 2884.14]  No one, uh, no one has managed to post anything.
[2884.14 --> 2891.14]  So let's take that as no one thinks EA has ever acquired anything and not earned it.
[2891.14 --> 2893.14]  I just saw a funny tweet coming.
[2893.14 --> 2894.14]  Um...
[2894.14 --> 2895.14]  Doop doop doop doop doop.
[2895.14 --> 2897.14]  Yeah, I see nothing.
[2897.14 --> 2900.14]  Someone apparently has the same steak knives as me.
[2900.14 --> 2902.14]  Okay, so let's talk, uh, let's talk.
[2902.14 --> 2906.14]  Guys, I don't know if you know, if you know this yet, but Linksys.
[2906.14 --> 2909.14]  So if you guys remember, Linksys used to be their own thing.
[2909.14 --> 2911.14]  And then they were acquired by Cisco.
[2911.14 --> 2916.14]  So any recent Linksys router actually has a big Cisco on it.
[2916.14 --> 2920.14]  And then like a little like Linksys somewhere, like maybe on the bottom.
[2920.14 --> 2929.14]  Um, Cisco, the deal is done, has sold off the Linksys, in fact the entire consumer networking business unit to Belkin.
[2929.14 --> 2931.14]  Of all companies.
[2931.14 --> 2935.14]  So Cisco gradually closed things down, like Flip.
[2935.14 --> 2937.14]  I don't know if you guys remember Flip video.
[2937.14 --> 2938.14]  I mean that was doomed anyway.
[2938.14 --> 2941.14]  Just because phones were catching up.
[2941.14 --> 2942.14]  Yeah, yeah.
[2942.14 --> 2943.14]  So fast.
[2943.14 --> 2949.14]  It's like, yeah, I'm gonna carry around a dedicated device to film crappy videos.
[2949.14 --> 2950.14]  No offense to Flip.
[2950.14 --> 2956.14]  I made a video about the Flip way back when and basically, because, you know, I try not to, you know,
[2956.14 --> 2959.14]  If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.
[2959.14 --> 2961.14]  It's sort of the approach that I take.
[2961.14 --> 2965.14]  But what I did do in the video was I showed a sample video shot with the Flip.
[2965.14 --> 2967.14]  Or I shot another video with the Flip.
[2967.14 --> 2971.14]  So I let people make their own decision on what they think about the Flip's image quality.
[2971.14 --> 2980.14]  I had a Flip HD that I borrowed from a friend to film me unboxing and talking about a Ducky
[2980.14 --> 2981.14]  9008 DK2.
[2981.14 --> 2982.14]  You're such a dork.
[2982.14 --> 2986.14]  If you can find that video props to you.
[2986.14 --> 2987.14]  He's not this guy, he does unboxings.
[2987.14 --> 2990.14]  I don't know the account name to that YouTube.
[2990.14 --> 2994.14]  I don't know the password to that mysterious account name to that YouTube.
[2994.14 --> 2997.14]  So I can't help you find it, but it's out there somewhere.
[2997.14 --> 2999.14]  Um, I don't even know if I'm in it.
[2999.14 --> 3003.14]  I think I just talk and like I'm holding it towards the thing.
[3003.14 --> 3006.14]  Oh, so it's like one of those like, um, POV unboxings.
[3006.14 --> 3008.14]  Yeah, where you like can't see anything.
[3008.14 --> 3011.14]  In like a dimly lit room and you're like, oh yeah.
[3011.14 --> 3013.14]  I'm really excited about this.
[3013.14 --> 3015.14]  Like mouth breathing into the camera.
[3015.14 --> 3017.14]  It's so cool.
[3017.14 --> 3021.14]  It's not even like, it's pretty bad.
[3021.14 --> 3023.14]  Basically what I do is show off blue switches.
[3023.14 --> 3025.14]  That's basically what I did.
[3025.14 --> 3026.14]  Anyways.
[3026.14 --> 3027.14]  Yeah.
[3027.14 --> 3031.14]  Um, that's why I had that Flip and then I still have it because I haven't seen that guy since.
[3031.14 --> 3033.14]  Okay, here we go.
[3033.14 --> 3035.14]  Hey, someone defending EA.
[3035.14 --> 3038.14]  EA acquired Criterion, which are still alive and making happy.
[3038.14 --> 3039.14]  You know what?
[3039.14 --> 3040.14]  Hold on.
[3040.14 --> 3041.14]  The Lynxist thing.
[3041.14 --> 3042.14]  So we'll go back to that.
[3042.14 --> 3043.14]  Hold on.
[3043.14 --> 3044.14]  Okay.
[3044.14 --> 3045.14]  The look on your face kind of said it all.
[3045.14 --> 3047.14]  But, uh, so guys, you know what?
[3047.14 --> 3051.14]  I'd love, let's, uh, let's reach out to the Twitch chat for a change.
[3051.14 --> 3052.14]  I love you guys.
[3052.14 --> 3062.14]  Um, so tell us what you think about the Lynxist, uh, the Lynxist deal where they are being,
[3062.14 --> 3068.14]  there we go, where they are being acquired by Belkin.
[3068.14 --> 3071.14]  It just seems like such a strange thing.
[3071.14 --> 3073.14]  So let's scroll down to the bottom.
[3073.14 --> 3075.14]  Someone just said, I hate that Fallout 3 doesn't work on Windows 7.
[3075.14 --> 3076.14]  It does.
[3076.14 --> 3077.14]  Fix it.
[3077.14 --> 3078.14]  Someone doesn't care.
[3078.14 --> 3079.14]  Someone loves bacon.
[3079.14 --> 3081.14]  I think Belkin's a good company.
[3081.14 --> 3083.14]  Cisco, something bankrupt and something.
[3083.14 --> 3084.14]  Holy crap.
[3084.14 --> 3085.14]  Wow.
[3085.14 --> 3088.14]  Now I remember why we don't use the, uh,
[3088.14 --> 3089.14]  Because we can't read it.
[3089.14 --> 3090.14]  Okay.
[3090.14 --> 3092.14]  Lynxist is the whole router co-
[3092.14 --> 3093.14]  Uh, okay.
[3093.14 --> 3094.14]  You know what?
[3094.14 --> 3095.14]  I give up.
[3095.14 --> 3097.14]  Can one of the mods put it on slow mode?
[3097.14 --> 3098.14]  Ah, it's okay.
[3098.14 --> 3099.14]  We're done.
[3099.14 --> 3100.14]  Okay.
[3100.14 --> 3103.14]  That was pretty much it.
[3103.14 --> 3105.14]  I mean, for me, Belkin's, uh, I mean, okay.
[3105.14 --> 3107.14]  So why did Cisco get rid of it?
[3107.14 --> 3113.14]  Because, and see, this is, this is the thing that kind of kills me about the way business
[3113.14 --> 3118.14]  is done versus the way that a normal person might think makes sense.
[3118.14 --> 3125.14]  So Cisco has a certain profit margin that they have to maintain in order to please their
[3125.14 --> 3128.14]  shareholders and to make their numbers look good.
[3128.14 --> 3132.14]  So it doesn't matter how much money they're making in general, it's the percentages in
[3132.14 --> 3133.14]  everything.
[3133.14 --> 3136.14]  It's, it's making sure that those numbers all keep growing.
[3136.14 --> 3137.14]  Yeah.
[3137.14 --> 3139.14]  So you have to grow how much revenue you're doing.
[3139.14 --> 3141.14]  You have to grow your profit margin.
[3141.14 --> 3143.14]  You have to grow your market share.
[3143.14 --> 3144.14]  You have to grow your units sold.
[3144.14 --> 3146.14]  You have to grow them all at the same time.
[3146.14 --> 3150.14]  That's what gives shareholders a big happy smiley face and makes them invest money into
[3150.14 --> 3151.14]  your company.
[3151.14 --> 3157.14]  So if I'm Cisco and I'm like, okay, so I own this Lynxist consumer, consumer brand, and they
[3157.14 --> 3165.14]  sell routers and maybe compared to Cisco equipment, which has well into double digits margins
[3165.14 --> 3171.14]  on it, like well into double digits margins because the actual bomb cost of a high end
[3171.14 --> 3178.14]  Cisco switch is not this, the opposite of that is peanuts compared to the development
[3178.14 --> 3180.14]  and the software that went into it.
[3180.14 --> 3184.14]  So if they can sell, once they're done developing the thing, if they can actually sell any of them,
[3184.14 --> 3197.14]  then they're like,
[3197.14 --> 3202.14]  YAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHMMih!
[3202.14 --> 3205.14]  And the thing is they'll probably sell quite a few.
[3205.14 --> 3206.14]  Yeah.
[3206.14 --> 3209.14]  Whereas with a consumer product, okay, you have to put in all that work developing it.
[3209.14 --> 3213.22]  these back-end programs and you got to deal with end users and they want all
[3213.22 --> 3219.22]  this you know you got people calling you and they're like oh the lights aren't on
[3219.22 --> 3227.68]  did you plug it in? oh no my internet's not working. Do you have internet? Is it the WPS?
[3227.68 --> 3233.56]  Does that open the port? So that's the kind of thing that a company like Cisco
[3233.56 --> 3238.30]  is not really set up for or accustomed to so the amount of overhead that goes
[3238.30 --> 3242.90]  into dealing with retail consumer brands and how low the margins are compared to
[3242.90 --> 3247.84]  their traditional business so if I was sort of the only one making the decision
[3247.84 --> 3254.62]  I'd go okay well are they profitable? yes. Are they doing business? Are they
[3254.62 --> 3259.84]  employing people? Are they providing a good service to their customers? yes yes yes
[3259.84 --> 3266.38]  yes okay leave it alone what's wrong with it? Whereas from a bigger business
[3266.38 --> 3271.12]  perspective are they profitable is not as important as are they growing our profit
[3271.12 --> 3278.02]  margin? So there you go. Belkin on the other hand is accustomed to the low margin
[3278.02 --> 3283.72]  sort of consumer oriented branding business. The one concern I'd have about
[3283.72 --> 3290.98]  Belkin is do they have the do they have the cojones to do the kinds of things that
[3290.98 --> 3298.72]  Linksys did where they had very long term SKUs things like WRT 54 GL ran forever
[3298.72 --> 3305.32]  amazing things like EA 4500 even have a long life cycle compared to what I've seen
[3305.32 --> 3310.30]  from typical Belkin consumer products where they just they're there and then
[3310.30 --> 3317.20]  they kind of they're on fire sale and then they're gone so yeah I'm very very
[3317.20 --> 3320.98]  interested to see how how all of that shapes down I mean it comes down to that
[3320.98 --> 3324.94]  theme that we had when we excuse me when we were talking about motherboards
[3324.94 --> 3328.72]  before where it's that consolidation so how many networking guys are left
[3328.72 --> 3337.60]  compared to how many there were before okay well Cisco doesn't care so just so
[3337.60 --> 3343.54]  you know Cisco did nothing wrong they got rid of an asset it's not their problem
[3343.54 --> 3347.44]  anymore they made a bunch of money selling it and or no they didn't they lost a
[3347.44 --> 3350.26]  lot of money because they acquired it for like five billion or something that
[3350.26 --> 3355.30]  yeah they made instant cash okay yes they have cash in the bank my friends GPU died
[3355.30 --> 3367.96]  out of nowhere sometimes it happens sure why not vector nice scared you click on
[3367.96 --> 3373.12]  buttons man hey he seemed like pretty coherent didn't the last one seem pretty
[3373.12 --> 3378.28]  coherent yeah I think so we all got screamed at 75 to $100 mid tower get a
[3378.28 --> 3381.16]  Define R4
[3381.16 --> 3386.62]  well I know uh GTX 680 now or wait for you know what this is always the eternal
[3386.62 --> 3392.00]  question let me put it this way if you can afford a GTX 680 right now and it
[3392.00 --> 3394.96]  meets your performance requirements go for it
[3394.96 --> 3400.06]  GTX 700 series is gonna be a lot more expensive than you can acquire a 680 for
[3400.06 --> 3405.82]  right now there's a at NCIX this week there's a GTX 670 for what was it to
[3405.82 --> 3414.22]  280 or something it's like 289 or yeah under $300 after a mail-in rebate comes
[3414.22 --> 3420.94]  with a game so yeah will a 700 series perform better yes will it cost probably
[3420.94 --> 3426.04]  double to triple that yes it will so it's up to you man one thing you can always do
[3426.04 --> 3429.88]  is we don't necessarily support it on our forums yet because of multiple reasons but
[3429.88 --> 3434.78]  you can jump on a hardware forum move your card after you buy it and pick up a
[3434.78 --> 3438.22]  higher end one yeah or better yet find someone who's unloading their 680 in
[3438.22 --> 3442.12]  anticipation of 700 series right now yeah I guarantee you they're out there
[3442.12 --> 3443.32]  yeah they're out there
[3443.32 --> 3445.32]  they're out there
[3445.32 --> 3450.76]  I'm looking for a CPU cooler and an SSD I'm a heavy gamer which has absolutely
[3450.76 --> 3456.28]  nothing to do with your CPU cooler or your SSD but grab an H100i and grab either
[3456.28 --> 3463.00]  an 840 Pro 256 gig or a vector 256 gig well Linus it's 1 a.m. here I'm sorry I can't
[3463.00 --> 3467.68]  stay I'm sorry to Brian Linus have my babies it really doesn't work that way
[3467.68 --> 3472.26]  that's not really a tech tip but you'll just have to trust me on this one yes
[3472.26 --> 3479.12]  quickfire TK is a great keyboard for a non-spacious area sorry I don't have time
[3479.12 --> 3483.70]  for that right now hi Puerto Rico please fix the focus of the live stream it's the
[3483.70 --> 3487.12]  focus off I think it's on autofocus so I think it's going back and forth I can
[3487.12 --> 3493.84]  try to fix it sure okay slicks on it is PCIe 3.0 capable AMD motherboards only
[3493.84 --> 3500.14]  compatible with the share architecture ah yes wait what's what the heck is he
[3500.14 --> 3503.84]  talking about the share and bulldozer in the same thing the share is an
[3503.84 --> 3510.76]  architecture made up of bulldozer course so any of the newer FX 83 50 80 or
[3510.76 --> 3514.30]  6300 what am I doing I need you to move into the middle because it seems in when it
[3514.30 --> 3517.60]  focuses move into the middle yeah because I need to be able to see you when it's
[3517.60 --> 3521.02]  trying to focus okay okay
[3521.02 --> 3523.02]  is that better
[3523.02 --> 3529.04]  it's actually hard to make it focus when you're doing that
[3529.04 --> 3532.88]  all right I think that's good though uh slick did you kill pay Arthur at
[3532.88 --> 3538.16]  he says no okay no doesn't melt Belkin still make their own routers isn't this
[3538.16 --> 3540.62]  sort of anti-competitive what do you think Belkin is going to do with it they'll
[3540.62 --> 3543.92]  probably still maintain both brands in much the same way that Cisco never
[3543.92 --> 3549.62]  well they did kind of rebrand all the routers Cisco but those only knew the
[3549.62 --> 3555.16]  end was Apple had a motherboard market okay we're talking guys we're talking
[3555.16 --> 3562.72]  about branded motherboards sold on their own guess I won't buy links this anymore
[3562.72 --> 3569.46]  4500 is still gonna be awesome even when Cisco doesn't own it yes we don't bench on a
[3569.46 --> 3574.16]  C70 we use that as our thermal test bench I still think deep well okay sort of a
[3574.16 --> 3575.16]  bench yeah
[3575.16 --> 3587.08]  so let's just leave that there for a bit oh my god that's awkward um Jason Lee asks why not sell linksys to
[3587.08 --> 3594.12]  d-link or asus my bet would be that they didn't actually have enough money or care to buy it asus is
[3594.12 --> 3598.74]  quickly gaining market share in the networking space they are just rolling
[3598.74 --> 3603.06]  well like everything freaking huge so it kind of makes sense asus is just asus
[3603.06 --> 3606.28]  where you're just kind of like okay the first generation product might not be
[3606.28 --> 3610.62]  perfect and the second generation product might not still be perfect but the
[3610.62 --> 3615.02]  third generation one will just sort of roll everything else and everyone else
[3615.02 --> 3617.82]  might as well just go home they'll take a bit but they'll get it right and then
[3617.82 --> 3622.40]  we'll just crush yeah that's asus for you it's like it's like their their mission
[3622.40 --> 3627.94]  statement much this must just be like take your time go into new categories
[3627.94 --> 3635.64]  question mark destroy because they're asus I mean it's not I'm not saying it's
[3635.64 --> 3639.40]  necessary a bad thing I'm an asus kind of guy
[3639.40 --> 3650.32]  andy when stock clock crisis warhead I don't know about this I'm running away my
[3650.32 --> 3655.56]  friends she oh okay okay I think we we've caught up okay so let's talk about
[3655.56 --> 3662.32]  THQ being gone bye-bye okay so so where did it all go consolidation is the theme of
[3662.32 --> 3669.52]  the night I couldn't find the exact post that I couldn't find the exact post that I
[3669.52 --> 3673.66]  used for our netlinked weekly I don't know I looked for it quite a bit using the exact same
[3673.66 --> 3677.56]  okay we filmed an episode of netlinked weekly today that had all the numbers on it as well
[3677.56 --> 3684.24]  but it might not be live yet yeah um but I do have the company acquisitions so sega acquired relic
[3684.24 --> 3690.48]  who makes company heroes in warhammer um coach media how does sega still exist and THQ doesn't
[3690.48 --> 3695.84]  that's what I want to know it actually kind of blows my mind I have no idea like I think sega
[3695.84 --> 3700.44]  oh like I don't know this I wish I did but I think sega kind of just owns a lot of stuff I
[3700.44 --> 3706.22]  know they do so who cares they're just a they're in their apparent company now it doesn't matter
[3706.22 --> 3713.42]  coach media the guys that bought volition they're a parent company right okay they own the they own
[3713.42 --> 3720.80]  the company that makes Dead Island okay and Dead Island wasn't that just one game okay so it was one
[3720.80 --> 3730.28]  game twice yeah okay so wasn't it like not a very well regarded game some people really liked it I
[3730.28 --> 3734.90]  well I've heard kind of broad ends of the spectrum on each side okay some people liked it a lot or
[3734.90 --> 3739.72]  absolutely hate it I think it had fun multiplayer okay or co-op or something I never actually played
[3739.72 --> 3744.32]  it co-op zombie games it's kind of hard to go wrong yeah so like I think that's kind of their thing
[3744.32 --> 3747.92]  there I'm not entirely sure though coach or cotch or I'm not sure how to say this but cotch media
[3747.92 --> 3756.86]  took out volition which has saints row and they bought metro so 2033 and the rates to 2034 okay
[3756.86 --> 3762.98]  and then cry tech grabbed homefront which I think cry tech is already making homefront 2 so they just
[3762.98 --> 3767.54]  bought the whole thing so now it's theirs instead of buying the rights to do it temporarily okay
[3767.54 --> 3772.64]  instead of being a developer for yeah yeah so now they own the whole thing so they just basically
[3772.64 --> 3777.10]  were like okay we'll take that if you're offering it all right I mean if it's if they knew they were
[3777.10 --> 3781.32]  making actually that's probably a really good sign oh yeah because cry tech knows their business and
[3781.32 --> 3786.74]  if cry tech thinks whatever they're working on is like I'm gonna be good then I sort of trust cry
[3786.74 --> 3793.60]  tech inherently that's good take two who is 2k and rockstar grabbed evolve which is a codename project
[3793.60 --> 3800.90]  so not sure what that is could it be a new uh what was that that game by the sims guy that no one cared
[3800.90 --> 3809.32]  about sports for that maybe it's a new spore probably not I think wasn't that one of like the biggest
[3809.32 --> 3814.48]  devastating I was stoked for that game I bought the like pre-release character creator thing and I
[3814.48 --> 3820.90]  bought the game and it's just like what isn't that bad yeah I paid I played one full time through just
[3820.90 --> 3826.08]  because I was like no I bought both these things I will play it but I just that was a waste of time
[3826.08 --> 3833.78]  huh it's just not like it's war 2 go pre-buy it they developed it for like ridiculous amounts of time
[3833.78 --> 3838.64]  yeah oh yeah I don't remember how long it was and then it was just like devastating oh this feels like
[3838.64 --> 3842.74]  an indie game that you developed in like a couple months well it was one of those like Alan Wake type
[3842.74 --> 3847.62]  things where it's like I'm sorry you were working on this game for how long yeah and then you ended up
[3847.62 --> 3851.88]  with what was apparently I never played it but was apparently a pretty decent game Alan Wake yeah
[3851.88 --> 3858.10]  yeah lots of people like it but I mean they were talking about Alan Wake when I was running a 9600 pro
[3858.10 --> 3863.30]  like I've been talking about this stuff for a long time then it comes out and sucks Ubisoft grabbed
[3863.30 --> 3870.28]  South Park Stick of Truth so have you seen videos for that no it actually looks like the first game
[3870.28 --> 3876.78]  based off like a tv show that I would actually be interested in I did play the South Park game for
[3876.78 --> 3882.12]  N64 though the snowball fight was awesome I think South Park is the only one that can like really
[3882.12 --> 3887.68]  pull it off well they have the like the character style already they adapt very well they have sort
[3887.68 --> 3893.02]  of as long as they've actually got the writing team involved to make it like I think they did
[3893.02 --> 3899.12]  South Park humor like there's been Simpsons games that if I hear correctly are somewhat oh the Simpsons
[3899.12 --> 3904.42]  side-scroller is awesome the old arcade game I've never played it no I've heard of it but I've never played it
[3904.42 --> 3908.70]  oh it's friggin amazing it's like the best side-scroller you're like Barton you're like swinging your
[3908.70 --> 3914.50]  skateboard around and like that's awesome yeah and like bad guys all look like uh Principal Skinner
[3914.50 --> 3920.34]  or whatever like yeah no it's awesome that's sweet so amazing but like actually pretty stoked for that
[3920.34 --> 3927.94]  and then they just completely consumed THQ Montreal they just went like oh I see they were ours now so
[3927.94 --> 3935.38]  yeah there's one wait I don't think you ever said Ubisoft that's what I don't did you say Ubisoft I
[3935.38 --> 3943.86]  think Ubisoft took over South Park Seek of Truth and then they yeah I think there's one title I don't
[3943.86 --> 3949.88]  remember which one it is it's the group that makes Darksiders they have not been purchased yet and that's
[3949.88 --> 3955.54]  because they are not up for sale okay I'm not entirely sure what's going on there I think it might be part
[3955.54 --> 3961.50]  of the bankruptcy deal but they're not up for sale which is kind of sucky because Darksiders was
[3961.50 --> 3965.38]  actually pretty awesome it goes to show you how much money it takes to run a publisher and game
[3965.38 --> 3971.06]  developer because it wasn't that long ago that THQ wasn't it like a month ago THQ ran that in the
[3971.06 --> 3976.04]  humble bundle that yeah that humble bundle they made like a lot of money from it that injected a lot of
[3976.04 --> 3982.06]  cash into the company and they're bankrupt now already yeah like was that did they already know that
[3982.06 --> 3986.82]  it was going down no matter what I think the idea with that because you notice like steam humble
[3986.82 --> 3991.24]  bundle like they picked up a new guy I don't remember who it was and he was like to run their
[3991.24 --> 3996.44]  company from there on because their old guy I don't know if it was the CEO but someone high end
[3996.44 --> 4001.34]  um was like I can't do this anymore and stepped back they picked up a new guy and then he just went
[4001.34 --> 4006.58]  nuts he pushed the humble bundle thing he pushed some crazy aggressive steam sales he just like went
[4006.58 --> 4011.64]  absolutely crazy but I just guess it wasn't enough probably spiraling too hard couldn't pull it out of it
[4011.64 --> 4018.20]  and then they just died I bet you if they were able to survive to things like uh company heroes 2
[4018.20 --> 4023.08]  if they were able to survive to that release they might have been able to pull it back out
[4023.08 --> 4028.00]  right they probably just couldn't live that long which is really unfortunate because THQ is pretty
[4028.00 --> 4034.84]  awesome I'm actually pretty upset that they're gone but some of the acquisitions I'm crisis yeah
[4034.84 --> 4039.88]  or crytech rather crytech ubisoft ubisoft has been doing really great so far okay lately fair enough
[4039.88 --> 4048.60]  except for you play I'm sorry but you plays like oh come on guys do the other day that was oh yeah
[4048.60 --> 4053.16]  we had all the files in the install directory and we went to play the game and it just it just
[4053.16 --> 4058.12]  disappeared had no idea completely gone no idea it was there I mean this is stuff that even uh
[4058.12 --> 4064.84]  even that other one that I even the gross orange circle of origin yeah origin even origin has that
[4064.84 --> 4070.84]  figured out um I haven't set up my entire house with insti on I haven't had time and one of the light
[4070.84 --> 4075.72]  switches I wired wrong so one of my other lights doesn't work so I'm sort of I'm waiting until
[4075.72 --> 4082.68]  that one yeah that's why that's why that doesn't work yeah okay so I'm um I can never find my shoes
[4082.68 --> 4091.88]  my brilliant plan is to go ahead and uh hold off on that for now until I can afford to do the whole
[4091.88 --> 4096.20]  house and have an electrician come in and just do it for me because it'd be pretty cool I don't know
[4096.20 --> 4101.16]  if insti on is the one I'd go with um just because I don't I haven't and I'm not saying I wouldn't
[4101.72 --> 4105.96]  but I haven't even tried yeah I haven't tried anything else and I haven't seen what they have in
[4105.96 --> 4111.08]  terms of like a software interface for managing the whole thing with automated like programmable
[4111.08 --> 4116.12]  events oh okay like the phone app is good and it works and blah blah blah blah like I know it all
[4116.12 --> 4121.72]  works but I need to know if I can program things like while I'm away if I can have random lights
[4121.72 --> 4126.36]  turn on at random intervals just make it look like you're at home yeah yeah so cool cool stuff like
[4126.36 --> 4132.36]  that baby mode would be cool just have everything in the house turn off baby mode yeah be like baby
[4132.36 --> 4140.84]  sleeping mode just like power down everything yeah so then when he cries and I'm trying to go
[4140.84 --> 4146.12]  and get to him then I can trip over his toys and step on his legos and I didn't mean lights you know
[4146.12 --> 4151.96]  what I've made noise calm down the best things that make noise it's completely unrelated to the light
[4151.96 --> 4157.48]  I don't think there's anything in my house that makes noise you have kind of a eerily quiet house yeah my
[4157.48 --> 4163.80]  house is sort of quiet um minus what's the forum server running don't ask me forum server running
[4163.80 --> 4167.96]  what do you mean what do you mean hardware software what are you talking about apache
[4167.96 --> 4177.48]  sent to us apache sent to us uh what boards in there 980x it's a uh 980x on an msi big bang
[4178.20 --> 4185.96]  oh yeah oh yeah big bang x power we had a 650 ti in there that got pulled out and replaced with what
[4185.96 --> 4193.48]  card did you give me uh i think it was a 2600 xt passive passive card yeah passive card pretty cool
[4193.48 --> 4200.52]  um some fsp 400 watt power supply we had a stock cooler in there that uh this was due to slicks utter
[4200.52 --> 4205.32]  incompetence actually you know what i must have had it in there so it's possible it's got plastic push
[4205.32 --> 4210.12]  pins so i think one of them popped out or maybe i didn't have it quite in enough so that was that was
[4210.12 --> 4215.32]  causing some overheating and cpu throttling so we have a stock intel cooler in there that's like one of the
[4215.32 --> 4221.40]  baller ones with the blue led and like the copper all around it and like an extreme edition stock heat
[4221.40 --> 4227.88]  sink to explain a lot of the outages um we now have a new boss mode firewall and since it's been
[4227.88 --> 4232.84]  installed how many times has he said we've been attacked i think it was like 9 000 times that this
[4232.84 --> 4238.84]  one guy like the afternoon after the new firewall was installed it was hit some guy was hitting it like
[4238.84 --> 4244.84]  9 000 times like like that afternoon we're getting ddos right away so like we've been getting hit pretty
[4244.84 --> 4251.72]  hard um we had power issues today oh that was awesome explain what was running on what the
[4251.72 --> 4257.72]  electricians wired up the tech tips studio incorrectly so there's a bank of eight outlets that's supposed
[4257.72 --> 4263.08]  to run all the lights and it's a 30 amp circuit for these eight outlets so it's supposed to run all of
[4263.08 --> 4270.60]  the lights and the test computers and all that stuff and it went out and i'm like what form server goes
[4270.60 --> 4276.20]  down i'm freaking out so 30 amp circuit goes out i mean what were we running off the thing like a
[4276.20 --> 4282.36]  microwave you know 2000 watt like no we didn't have a microwave so i'm like okay so i go down to the
[4282.36 --> 4287.32]  breaker and i call up the warehouse manager i'm like the only one that's tripped is this 15 amp breaker
[4287.32 --> 4292.44]  everything else is fine and he's like no no for sure they hooked up that one to the 30 amp breaker and
[4292.44 --> 4298.76]  the other one to the other thing i'm like so we we dig into it and it turns out that we have basically
[4298.76 --> 4305.96]  the tv in the back of the ncix tech tip set running off of a 30 amp breaker and then we have a 15 amp
[4305.96 --> 4312.20]  breaker for all of our lights and test benches and everything else and the servers and everything and
[4312.20 --> 4316.76]  everything so that happens so the electrician's coming in to switch that around and then we had
[4316.76 --> 4321.32]  to find another circuit we had to run a wire from there to run the server off in the meantime so it
[4321.32 --> 4325.96]  doesn't go down when the electrician comes in and switches it around and then i had to
[4325.96 --> 4335.48]  we i had to take out the 650 ti i had to take out the 660 ti that was in my windows server
[4338.04 --> 4344.84]  this is actually pretty funny i'm gonna show this someone says i found slick and it's uh like
[4344.84 --> 4351.96]  why is that me hold on hold on hold on hold on it's like a meme picture called friend zone uh keep
[4351.96 --> 4357.56]  telling yourself it's better than the motivational yeah it's whatever you're a demotivational poster
[4357.56 --> 4362.04]  it does kind of look like you though actually does it yeah here hold your head above above that guy
[4364.04 --> 4365.88]  i have to go like well now you're so close
[4367.72 --> 4371.64]  yeah see now it totally looks like that's awesome i usually have short hair though i just
[4371.64 --> 4374.52]  haven't gotten a haircut in like seven months yeah
[4374.52 --> 4376.52]  yeah
[4378.04 --> 4381.16]  do you want a beta key for firefall i'm okay
[4383.24 --> 4388.12]  i probably would never play yeah i don't really have no time for mmo you guys all right man i
[4388.12 --> 4393.16]  appreciate it but it would probably be better spent on someone else we appreciate it um do we have any
[4393.16 --> 4398.04]  other topics for tonight i'm sure there was something the far card three benchmark video i want to know if
[4398.04 --> 4402.92]  people are interested okay you talk about that i'll go see if i had any other notes okay so we're planning a
[4402.92 --> 4411.80]  bunch of videos for like actually some of the cards behind me like what card for what card is best
[4411.80 --> 4418.76]  amd versus nvidia so we'll show like the best two cards under different price points uh for far cry 3.
[4418.76 --> 4422.92]  so we're choosing three different price points you guys will see the videos but um i had to set up
[4422.92 --> 4430.36]  the benchmark for it and it's kind of a fun benchmark so what i want to do is show my methodology for the
[4430.36 --> 4436.20]  benchmark so it's if you've played one of the uh if you've played far cry 3 it's one of the trials
[4436.20 --> 4440.20]  and it's the one where you're driving in the jeep and you have to hit everyone you have to run over all the guys
[4440.92 --> 4445.56]  so what my methodology is you drive around you drive up the thing you hit all the time barrels
[4445.56 --> 4450.44]  but the plan is you don't hit any of the guys to make it consistent because it's way easier to not hit the
[4450.44 --> 4455.08]  guys than it is to hit the guys so i was wondering if you guys were interested in
[4455.08 --> 4464.28]  in us posting a video of like linus describing what the benchmark is about showing like me getting
[4464.28 --> 4468.52]  into the game and then showing where where i start the benchmark starting the benchmark going through
[4468.52 --> 4473.32]  the whole thing and ending it and then linus ending off the video if you guys would actually
[4473.32 --> 4479.40]  think that's interesting content we've never shown our benchmarking methodology that deeply before
[4479.40 --> 4484.28]  like we've never shown the actual run fully i don't think uh i think i've done videos where the
[4484.28 --> 4488.36]  camera's over my shoulder shoulder and you're doing the benchmark but we haven't like properly shown the
[4488.36 --> 4493.48]  whole benchmark in fraps like on the screen so you can see it really clearly before and we'd like for
[4493.48 --> 4498.04]  you guys to be able to run it and compare your own systems so you can go okay what kind of performance
[4498.04 --> 4503.64]  do i get versus if i was running a system like what they're running and i think that's cool right yeah and
[4503.64 --> 4509.00]  i think this would be really fun in his uh section of the forum the linus whatever whatever ramblings
[4509.00 --> 4513.24]  section if he posts that video up and then we can show our results and then you guys can show all
[4513.24 --> 4518.44]  your results of your systems yeah that's cool so everyone yeah so everyone can see like okay if i get
[4518.44 --> 4524.36]  this system it will run far cry 3 this well and that's cool because compared to most like reviews or
[4524.36 --> 4531.48]  whatever else where you have whatever their review system was you don't necessarily you need more variety
[4531.48 --> 4536.28]  than that because the way that you do a review is very different from the way that you look at
[4536.28 --> 4542.44]  overall how does this game run on a variety of platforms because you tend to do things like
[4542.44 --> 4548.28]  over ball out the cpu so that you can see the differences between all the graphics cards whereas
[4548.28 --> 4554.60]  if we have people posting their configurations cpu gpu ram um it's probably the only thing that really
[4554.60 --> 4561.16]  matters uh cpu gpu ram and frames per second then that gives us a really clear picture
[4561.16 --> 4565.96]  of which platforms it runs best on and what affects the performance of that particular
[4565.96 --> 4573.00]  uh game yeah and someone someone will post that sometime being like i have a 3570k and a saber
[4573.00 --> 4577.24]  tooth with eight gigs of ram and then everyone will be able to properly see what their system
[4577.24 --> 4585.00]  running yeah that's very whatever graphics card all right so i uh i called the bell customer service
[4585.00 --> 4594.92]  quote uh butt heads unquote on the last live stream and i would just like to say that they have proven
[4594.92 --> 4601.16]  themselves to me and in my in my eyes they have really gone above and beyond the call of duty
[4601.80 --> 4610.20]  and they actually had did i i don't think i even told you this but the guy who called me to follow up
[4610.20 --> 4615.88]  on what was going on so they tracked down my name and my phone number and called me and they were like
[4615.88 --> 4622.92]  is this a good time to talk because our understanding is that you may have had a negative experience with
[4622.92 --> 4628.92]  bell customer service which i should clarify it wasn't quite so much that it was a negative experience
[4628.92 --> 4637.08]  is that it was a complicated and time-consuming experience they um what i was doing was i was
[4637.08 --> 4643.80]  transferring the ownership of a cell phone plan from a corporate account to a personal account
[4643.80 --> 4651.80]  to a different small business account under someone else's existing account so what i was doing was
[4651.80 --> 4659.48]  extremely complicated on top of that i was changing my plan and i was trying to see if i qualified for a
[4659.48 --> 4667.00]  hardware upgrade and i was trying to get a new phone so that's what was going on that's why i was on the
[4667.00 --> 4673.16]  phone with bell customer service for like an entire day um they were more difficult than because
[4673.16 --> 4678.44]  people didn't really understand exactly what i was trying to do and for their small business plans
[4678.44 --> 4684.68]  they're not just on the website you can't actually do like a comparison so everything's verbal so there's
[4684.68 --> 4692.20]  a lot of miscommunication whereas finally i just got in a car and went to the bell store and got someone
[4692.20 --> 4697.56]  to pull out their cheat sheet that only they're allowed to see it says like confidential everything all over the top of it
[4697.56 --> 4702.36]  and i was like look no one can give me a clear idea of exactly what's in this plan
[4702.36 --> 4705.48]  so how about you look that way for a minute i'm gonna take a picture of this
[4705.48 --> 4710.28]  so that if there's ever any debate about what my plan entails we'll all know
[4711.24 --> 4714.44]  so so that that got done and then they clarified everything
[4714.44 --> 4721.48]  and um i was just frustrated because it took so long and i was also frustrated because because of
[4721.48 --> 4729.00]  what the existing owner of the corporate account integrated my phone number had done before i didn't
[4729.00 --> 4733.96]  qualify for a hardware upgrade even though i otherwise would have so uh so that was where some
[4733.96 --> 4739.16]  of the miscommunication was there because they had renewed my agreement when they moved it over to
[4739.16 --> 4743.96]  something else in some way so that's why i didn't qualify for my hardware upgrade so i was frustrated
[4743.96 --> 4749.24]  about that as well but it wasn't actually bell's fault in that case so before you guys sort of go
[4749.24 --> 4754.12]  like oh vinus is paid off by bell i can tell you right now i'm not i pay a bell cell phone bill just
[4754.12 --> 4759.72]  like every other bell customer uh they did clarify a couple of things about my plan that i hadn't managed
[4759.72 --> 4766.44]  to figure out until now um but they were they were sort of deeply concerned that i had you know called
[4766.44 --> 4769.96]  because they didn't say that i called them butt heads but they said that i might have had a
[4769.96 --> 4774.84]  complaint and i couldn't actually remember even mentioning it in the live stream it was slick who
[4774.84 --> 4780.44]  told me that in the live stream i had said something about bell so i had to go back and watch the
[4780.44 --> 4784.76]  archive where i was like oh i called them butt heads that's probably that's probably why they were
[4784.76 --> 4790.84]  upset so our new plan is to call everyone but yeah so we're going to start with intel intel's a bunch
[4790.84 --> 4796.04]  of butt heads they're just all they're all buttheads they're all buttheads the biggest buttheads let's see if i get
[4796.04 --> 4803.80]  a call from oh right so the guy who called me reports directly to the vp at bell or avp anyway
[4803.80 --> 4809.48]  we need to like seriously call everyone buttheads so i need i'm expecting a call from craig barrett
[4809.48 --> 4817.72]  himself at this point you know apologizing for whatever whatever intel did to wrong us
[4819.72 --> 4825.64]  blame you for making good cpus yeah what's your problem you make so many cpus that like
[4825.64 --> 4834.44]  we can't find any other things that are better to buy so there so anyway uh yes i was frustrated
[4834.44 --> 4839.48]  it was probably not very nice of me to call them buttheads because i realize now that i sort of have
[4839.48 --> 4845.16]  a fair number of people watching so you know i'll be fair next time and i'll actually explain what
[4845.16 --> 4850.76]  happened and then i'll let you guys decide if you think that the company in question is buttheads or if
[4850.76 --> 4859.80]  they're not so there you go awesome yeah yeah that was sort of awesome uh so let's do some twitter q a
[4859.80 --> 4862.76]  and then i think we're probably going to wrap it up a little bit early because i think we're both
[4862.76 --> 4870.12]  really tired do i speak for both of us yes but yes you'll have his babies no i was talking about gabriel's
[4870.12 --> 4874.92]  comment go you're talking oh and bring up marius's comment and yes we love pure android compared to
[4874.92 --> 4883.16]  anything else pure android is like everything else should be cleansed yeah no offense to everyone
[4883.16 --> 4891.80]  else who tries to not do pure android i mean marius i love you guys but no no not really maybe a little
[4891.80 --> 4897.40]  bit in some games but for the amount of extra power it's going to consume a 260 with a what did you say
[4897.40 --> 4902.92]  670 yeah that would almost slow it down no a 260 is way fast no slick doesn't know what he's talking about
[4902.92 --> 4910.68]  physics yeah trust me physics only slows down if you use like really old fail stuff like 9600 gt i run
[4910.68 --> 4920.76]  an 8800 with a 460 which is a similar gap and it slowed it down okay it's not about the gap no i know
[4920.76 --> 4926.36]  i'm just yeah it's just about whether the card can get a gtx 260 is still a very capable card
[4928.84 --> 4932.52]  watching from norway at a land party go play games that's what i was saying that's why i said go to
[4932.52 --> 4938.04]  gabriel's oh yeah go play games gabriel i mean you can watch us too just make sure you have two
[4938.04 --> 4942.12]  monitors yeah like a smartphone which most land parties don't allow unless you're at like a buddy's
[4942.12 --> 4947.08]  house no because you could use um here okay you have to buy two seats this is what i used to do
[4947.08 --> 4953.80]  at uh at lands actually buy two seats no okay no no i didn't do that honestly do you think i would pay
[4953.80 --> 4959.16]  for two of anything no but i was thinking maybe a land party exactly so this is what i used to do if i
[4959.16 --> 4964.20]  wanted to have some kind of content that i was listening to at the same time i'd get open earbuds
[4964.20 --> 4971.16]  so not in not iem's but like just earbuds and then i'd wear my gaming headphones over top of them
[4971.16 --> 4977.72]  so that i could listen to music but actually have like my game sound not necessarily so so if i needed
[4977.72 --> 4981.40]  to get rid of them i could i could take them out at a moment's notice that's sort of a so you could have
[4981.40 --> 4986.84]  your smartphone running the live stream here and then uh so that would be on like the wi-fi network which
[4986.84 --> 4992.20]  they probably got segregated and ql s out the ging yang and then uh you could have everything else
[4992.20 --> 4997.72]  sort of running off of your wired connection what are some games you're looking forward to in 2013
[4997.72 --> 5003.56]  i'm looking forward to the star citizen alpha yeah and that's about it star citizen uh
[5006.60 --> 5012.76]  what is it called planetary planetary planetary annihilation planetary annihilation looks sweet does it
[5012.76 --> 5019.48]  yeah it sounds good it's an rts game but you can like expand to the moon and then like shoot like
[5019.48 --> 5024.76]  oh you can grab asteroids and strap rockets to the asteroids and bomb your enemy's base with asteroids
[5024.76 --> 5030.76]  so basically it's civilization except after you make the spaceship but like freaking awesome and like
[5030.76 --> 5038.92]  you can fight people with like planetary objects which is just sweet it brings back to the like 90s level
[5038.92 --> 5045.08]  of just awesome it's like doesn't make any sense but sweet i remain skeptical i think it's gonna be awesome
[5045.08 --> 5050.92]  it's a kickstarter game look it up my 660 keeps crashing usually happens during a visual glitch and comes back in like four seconds
[5050.92 --> 5056.92]  could be a power issue um could be an overall system stability issue may not actually be directly related
[5056.92 --> 5060.92]  uh neither neither of those are neither of those are good solutions
[5060.92 --> 5067.56]  uh what graphics card would you recommend for intense video editing on adobe software any cuda capable card
[5067.56 --> 5073.96]  particularly a quadro far cry 3 bench go got it you still planning on switching the form software due to
[5073.96 --> 5080.92]  all the glitches no we're gonna stick with vbullison 5 there are some issues but uh by and large it
[5080.92 --> 5088.44]  it works works there's a lot of like okay another bajillionth shout out to mr wizard and the rest of the mod team
[5088.44 --> 5096.92]  um but sorry rest of the mod team mainly mr wizard we've been like fighting v bolton 5 to make this
[5096.92 --> 5103.24]  thing work um there have been an incredible amount of problems but we've also made an incredible amount
[5103.24 --> 5109.88]  of progress it's fairly stable right now most of the outages that you see is because like we're running
[5109.88 --> 5113.96]  it in a horrible ghetto state with like hardware that shouldn't have been in there and stuff so today
[5113.96 --> 5118.28]  there were some outages that had to do with power and me moving it across the room to where
[5118.28 --> 5122.52]  it should stay where it should stay forever and like we're still working on the permanent solution
[5122.52 --> 5128.36]  and we got our new firewall so it had to go down while the new firewall was it's like a 1300 firewall
[5128.36 --> 5137.16]  so like yay like we're oh bye bye ddos yeah hopefully they can still happen we're we're moving forward
[5137.16 --> 5142.44]  we're working on things this isn't a huge budget project so we're trying to like yeah you gotta throw
[5142.44 --> 5147.00]  that in hey well i'm not i'm not giving him the budget for rack space is basically what he's not giving
[5147.00 --> 5151.72]  me the budget for any external hosting well we could have done external hosting if it was like
[5151.72 --> 5157.40]  that website hosting plan that included like no storage like how many five gigs of storage or
[5157.40 --> 5161.48]  something no what was it for the database you were allowed to have as many databases as you want but
[5161.48 --> 5166.20]  they couldn't be more than like 10 bags or something or one gig yeah and that was the biggest plan that
[5166.20 --> 5170.84]  was like pretty expensive and he wasn't stoked about yeah and then we had like five gigs of hard drive
[5170.84 --> 5176.28]  storage and like 512 megabytes of ram which is not gonna fly i mean like oh for context the server
[5176.28 --> 5182.68]  has 48 gigs of ram so it's caching a lot of the pages in ram rather than actually running off of the
[5182.68 --> 5192.20]  256 gig ssd that's in there falling back to the one terabyte re4 enterprise level raid one that is
[5192.20 --> 5199.00]  basically backing up everything what we did have budget for was computer hardware yeah we had budget for
[5199.00 --> 5204.68]  that yes because we had it but like oh there's a lot of stuff that still has to get in place one
[5204.68 --> 5208.92]  thing that i'm planning on doing and i've seen posts about this is rolling out ads on that right
[5208.92 --> 5215.40]  side under the thank you ncix label which is like just void space right now there was a poll someone
[5215.40 --> 5220.04]  put up a poll asking really some dude on the forum put up a poll being like we should do this because
[5220.04 --> 5224.84]  they're thinking it'll help with the charity drive okay which it would alleviate costs so it would
[5224.84 --> 5229.00]  well that doesn't necessarily contribute in any way to the charity drive the charity drive is a
[5229.00 --> 5234.28]  different thing but it would help us guys make sure if you're not doing it already just click the like
[5234.28 --> 5240.52]  button on all of our videos because if we hit our target for this month we're going to donate 250
[5240.52 --> 5245.96]  to the charity of your choice if you visit the linus tech tips forum in the charity section uh go there
[5245.96 --> 5250.04]  and then you have an option for a lot of different charities that we can contribute it to it basically
[5250.04 --> 5254.52]  comes directly out of my pocket so which is i think what the poll was about yeah it was about
[5254.52 --> 5259.88]  just helping you in general not necessarily it was a thanks for the charity i'm okay i know but i'm just
[5259.88 --> 5265.00]  they're trying to be nice so they said do you want to put that there and people either said yeah do it or
[5265.80 --> 5270.52]  i don't really care okay no one actually said no so if the forum was ad supported apparently people
[5270.52 --> 5277.24]  don't really get bothered by that no they don't want moving ads okay they don't want flashing like crazy
[5277.24 --> 5282.20]  stuff they want like stable kind of normal looking images so basically they want the ads that they
[5282.20 --> 5288.84]  can ignore no i think they want the ads that aren't like there's a difference there's a big difference
[5288.84 --> 5294.84]  you know which one used to drive me crazy the one where it was uh it was an ad for some smiley package
[5294.84 --> 5301.00]  and the guy says say something yeah do you remember that one yeah ridiculous and the other one that i hate
[5301.00 --> 5306.36]  is the one where it's like move your mouse to like punch george bush or whatever it is because i always just
[5306.36 --> 5310.60]  want to do it yeah i want to click on home but you have to hit usually it's like a target you have
[5310.60 --> 5317.16]  to hit it like three times or something so i'll do it like twice yeah um yes so we'll probably be
[5317.16 --> 5321.72]  rolling out ads not crazy ones i think they just don't ones that like attack your face right but
[5321.72 --> 5326.84]  we'll put like at least fairly passive ads put it on the right side and we'll try and alleviate some of
[5326.84 --> 5332.28]  that uh 2400 people watching tonight so it's a little slower than some other weeks but uh it is what it
[5332.28 --> 5338.12]  is and we're glad that you guys are tuned in we appreciate it 2440 we care about those 40. apparently
[5338.12 --> 5347.88]  his e4200v2 slowed down his internet that is probably something else or like legendarily broken
[5348.92 --> 5355.08]  uh sean why do i hate consoles two words and i will illustrate these words although i'm stoked for
[5355.08 --> 5360.68]  the new playstation new xbox because it'll push ported games to be better okay that yes but okay oh okay
[5360.68 --> 5366.12]  well then more than two words keyboard and mouse are words one and two and then the other things are
[5366.68 --> 5375.08]  holding back game development the only reason we don't have games that have real-time calculations and
[5375.08 --> 5382.44]  physics as part of the core gameplay are because they have to port it to consoles so there that's why
[5382.44 --> 5387.88]  consoles bother me i don't hate consoles he's like think about it nvidia shield is using a controller good
[5387.88 --> 5395.08]  for that i won't play shooters on it i can tell you that right now racing games on consoles yeah racing
[5395.08 --> 5403.56]  games yay um sports games yay i play assassin's creed on the computer but i use an xbox controller rpgs yay
[5403.56 --> 5411.88]  lots of stuff is way better on console compared to computer um yeah not all rpgs are better on console
[5411.88 --> 5418.44]  bird computer i think that okay no no no okay i'm thinking like final fantasy style way way better
[5418.44 --> 5422.12]  way better console like you play it with a controller like there's no reason you'd have to play it with
[5422.12 --> 5429.00]  a keyboard okay um um let's jump back on consoles real quick as far as i've seen both of them are
[5429.00 --> 5435.48]  coming out with eight gigs of ram and eight cores okay so like oh yeah right the xbox uh whatever it's
[5435.48 --> 5441.40]  going to be called specs leak we didn't even talk about that playstation too i heard that there's no
[5441.40 --> 5447.00]  way that that happened at the same time no i think playstation leaked earlier completely intentional
[5447.00 --> 5450.92]  like for them to both be around the same time you know you gotta imagine like both around the same
[5450.92 --> 5457.24]  spec you you gotta imagine like xbox executives and like playstation executives sitting around a table
[5457.24 --> 5462.76]  with like cigars and like playing cards and like discussing you know the schedule on which they'll both
[5462.76 --> 5468.52]  leak things and then this and then launch and like i'm you know i'm not accusing them of actually
[5468.52 --> 5474.76]  doing that because that's not good that's collusion or whatever it is but uh yeah i just you know you
[5474.76 --> 5479.88]  have like that image in your head when these things it's like when you know amd and intel launch cpu
[5479.88 --> 5489.72]  platforms at like the same time or amd and nvidia launch new gpus at like the same time so yeah uh what are
[5489.72 --> 5497.08]  some useful networking programs you suggest um what are you trying to do man windows 8 yeah what are you
[5497.08 --> 5503.88]  trying to do post on the networking forum yeah in linustectips.com benchmarking ideas epic got it
[5504.76 --> 5512.28]  all of my yes got it okay put it two different videos probably not uh h110 coming out coming very soon
[5512.28 --> 5520.44]  um it's different than the h100 because it's more bigger what do i think about w sd keyboards i think
[5520.44 --> 5524.60]  they're supposed to be pretty good never had my hands on one personally i've also not personally used
[5524.60 --> 5528.04]  one and also heard they're pretty good what are the best speakers for games and music for computer
[5528.04 --> 5535.24]  speakers just grab some sp2500s and be done with it have you tried like the clips pro media yeah but
[5535.24 --> 5543.40]  that's the promedia 2.1 is nothing like the promedia 5.1 ultra was though yeah it has a weak sub
[5543.40 --> 5550.92]  compared to the sp2500s okay i'd love to see the methodology awesome come home to australia no too
[5550.92 --> 5559.72]  hot 48 degrees celsius that's ridiculous is that even right no is it right i hope not yeah it's like all
[5559.72 --> 5564.52]  desert down there basically isn't it and it's the opposite season sim city beta is awesome ea didn't
[5564.52 --> 5572.28]  kill that yet all right i heard i've heard opposite really uh on reddit there's a sim city uh reddit
[5572.28 --> 5576.92]  and people are freaking out absolutely freaking out what's the key i haven't played it so i have
[5576.92 --> 5581.32]  no idea so i'm not going against you i'm just saying i've heard opposite i think someone asks this every
[5581.32 --> 5588.92]  live stream what is the keyboard i use on the live stream it is an azio kb178rt some games are not
[5588.92 --> 5595.80]  meant to be played with a controller yeah of course not right yeah uh would you recommend an fx8350 if
[5595.80 --> 5601.80]  you can leverage the course okay apparently the leaked xbox specs were faked all right i don't know man
[5601.80 --> 5607.56]  washington how far from the border is mcix uh depends where you are in washington washington's a big state
[5608.12 --> 5613.48]  all right i think we're pretty much done for the night good night everybody and thank you for tuning in to
[5613.48 --> 5619.40]  the live stream and don't forget to tune in to live streams featuring me
[5622.12 --> 5628.60]  thank you and me yeah you're here too yeah you're fired apparently that was apparently that joke is
[5628.60 --> 5634.60]  old now someone went like crazy defending me on the forum really and i was like thanks bro
[5635.24 --> 5640.28]  i didn't actually say anything but he was like no stop you guys are jerks and i was like that's kind of
[5640.28 --> 5645.72]  cool i appreciate it it's kind of cool but they must know you're not actually fired yeah or are you
[5645.72 --> 5651.80]  but no like it's i think it's not you that he's he was getting after it's the crazy amount of threads
[5651.80 --> 5657.96]  where people say slick is fired on the forum well you were fired a crazy number of times so it makes
[5657.96 --> 5662.76]  sense i heard someone was trying to actually keep track of how many times really fired yeah i haven't
[5662.76 --> 5667.96]  seen that yeah no i think i thought i saw like a tweet about it or something we're gonna try and add
[5667.96 --> 5673.08]  off screen fires them off screen that's gonna be tough because you get fired a lot yeah yeah he gets
[5673.08 --> 5680.28]  fired a lot i mean today oh no yesterday that thing where you ran all of the benchmarks and overclocked
[5680.28 --> 5686.20]  all okay okay so yeah embarrassed okay if he's gonna tell the story about how i threw a usb drive at the
[5686.20 --> 5694.12]  server then i'm gonna tell this story so slick i would like for you to actually tell me how many times you
[5694.12 --> 5704.36]  think i told you to use a cloud storage solution to log his maximum overclocks on this entire table
[5704.36 --> 5708.60]  full of video cards everything else i've ever overclocked while working with you behind us okay
[5709.48 --> 5715.96]  that as well as his results for the far cry three benchmarks he ran for six different cards so this
[5715.96 --> 5721.32]  was probably like four or five hours of testing finding maximum overclocks using crisis which is a good
[5721.32 --> 5728.04]  stress tester and then um and then running benchmarks on far cry three to uh and then making graphs
[5728.04 --> 5731.88]  making nice tidy graphs that we can show you guys in a video that we're going to release soon
[5731.88 --> 5738.36]  how many times did i tell you to save the files to cloud storage that day alone at least six okay
[5739.08 --> 5746.76]  and uh how many cloud storage uh services did you save them to i saved part of them to one okay
[5746.76 --> 5755.24]  and uh what were you saving them to google drive no no oh oh what they were all on was a patriot flash
[5755.24 --> 5760.28]  drive okay what happened to that flash drive i was trying to prep a video for true crypt didn't
[5760.28 --> 5764.68]  realize it was still in the machine and went to encrypt a flash drive encrypted the wrong one and erased
[5764.68 --> 5774.36]  everything so so i go i go so i go to his workstation and i'm like slick what are you doing are you finished the
[5774.36 --> 5783.08]  benchmarks he's like yeah i'm finished but it's all gone and he's trying to use a data recovery program
[5783.08 --> 5790.20]  to get the files back did that work how hard did i rub that you know i don't think i actually fired you
[5790.20 --> 5795.40]  because i think i basically said something like that's your training budget he came over to where i
[5795.40 --> 5800.04]  was and i'm sitting there like i never put the hood up on my sweater he's like he's like okay if he if he
[5800.04 --> 5807.56]  was if he it was warmer he'd have been sweating like how hard he was working at this oh i ended
[5807.56 --> 5813.88]  up running like three different data recovery programs and like oh i was not happy that was
[5813.88 --> 5820.68]  not a good time so i was just like what did we learn okay and the funny thing too is i'm writing him about
[5820.68 --> 5827.16]  it now but the only reason that i gave him such a hard time about this was that i have done it over and
[5827.16 --> 5833.88]  over and over again there's a reason that i harp on redundancy and there's a reason that i harp on
[5833.88 --> 5840.44]  backups there's a reason i have a raid 6 server in my house and an off-site raid 5 that it backs up to
[5840.44 --> 5845.24]  every night because i hate losing data and i've lost a lot of it the kicker that you don't know about is
[5845.24 --> 5851.56]  that drive i have been backing up because i knew it was important so i had everything from before the
[5851.56 --> 5859.64]  far cry 3 benchmarks on it and i had all of that i had just finished moving to drive so everything
[5859.64 --> 5866.52]  that didn't matter was was backed up to my personal pc and backed up to google drive and everything that
[5866.52 --> 5874.84]  currently mattered disappeared so so guys there's the lesson for you cloud is good uh backups in general
[5874.84 --> 5881.88]  are good um accidentally formatting things is bad not good so i i you know what i think i said earlier
[5881.88 --> 5886.52]  that i've never lost my music library that's not true i did lose it once i lost my music library
[5886.52 --> 5893.72]  and my entire photo library once when i was like i must have been grade 10 so when i was about 15 16
[5894.36 --> 5900.92]  and what happened it was an accidental format and i found a tool that recovered some of my pictures my
[5900.92 --> 5905.88]  problem is it wasn't a hard disk it was a flash drive even then like accidentally formatting a volume
[5905.88 --> 5911.56]  though oh yeah so that was actually the way that i've lost data in the past has never been physical
[5912.28 --> 5917.64]  drive failure because i've always used raid i've had one physical drive failure um this was when i was
[5917.64 --> 5923.16]  first i think i've told you about this first moving to my mineral lpc in the middle of building my mineral
[5923.16 --> 5929.00]  lpc and okay um like the hard drive in my mineral lpc sorry there's a piece of hair written for my face
[5929.00 --> 5937.64]  it's still there it's gone i can't see it anymore good enough for me go away the hard drive for my
[5937.64 --> 5945.16]  mineral lpc sat in like the the lid on top so the very last thing you do when you're done building my
[5945.16 --> 5951.32]  design is you put it on the top plug sata plug sata top it you're done that's the last thing in the
[5951.32 --> 5956.44]  whole build so i'm done my hands are covered in mineral oil and i go pick up my hard drive
[5956.44 --> 5963.56]  you see what's happening i'm really tired this build has taken me like 12 hours it's like three
[5963.56 --> 5967.40]  or four in the morning because i didn't realize how long it would take i pick up the drive and like
[5967.40 --> 5973.08]  all my stuff that i was using was on one table and the machine's on the other table so i pick up my drive
[5973.08 --> 5978.36]  and i go to walk over to the other table it's like right out of my hands because mineral oil is so slippery
[5978.36 --> 5984.20]  and the side of a hard drive is just like metal like very smooth metal so i plug it up just and i see it
[5984.20 --> 5990.92]  just hit the ground and i didn't even pick it up i was like nope i have a new drive here i'm just
[5990.92 --> 5996.60]  gonna put that game over man game over i know that's dead there's no point i ended up plugging
[5996.60 --> 6003.56]  it in like a month later it's like okay i think the only hard drive that i ever killed by dropping it
[6003.56 --> 6011.00]  was my old one terabyte external two and a half inch drive that had that awesome custom form factor
[6011.00 --> 6015.80]  like super fake two and a half inch drive i don't even remember where i got that thing from but it
[6015.80 --> 6020.92]  was a beast it was some custom seagate thing that i don't think many people bought them because it was
[6020.92 --> 6028.44]  really uncommon and i was moving a test bench and i used to keep the drive not on like a grippy pad the
[6028.44 --> 6035.24]  way that i do now yeah it was just on top of an optical drive slid out disconnected the wire hit the
[6035.24 --> 6040.76]  ground and well the rest is history but it only had like games on it it was like steam games so i
[6040.76 --> 6048.68]  was still annoyed because it had a lot of like steam games and i was in the middle of benchmarking
[6048.68 --> 6055.16]  the 6870 video the one on the wall of legend and so i that video oh that was one of my most frustrating
[6055.16 --> 6059.32]  videos ever anyway you know what we've run over time good night everybody and we'll see you next week
[6059.32 --> 6064.60]  same bat time same bat channel until we move it and then it will be a different bat time on it well
[6064.60 --> 6069.64]  the same bat channel there are no bats
