[0.00 --> 5.00]  Um, this is setting up a video upload right now.
[5.00 --> 8.00]  Hey, that one's good. Hey! We're in pretty good shape here.
[8.00 --> 11.00]  We got our screen capture, we got our Twitter feed.
[11.00 --> 13.00]  One minute late! Come on, man!
[13.00 --> 16.00]  What are you trying to do to us here?
[16.00 --> 19.00]  Hold on, some of the settings are wrong here. I just gotta tweak the color.
[19.00 --> 24.00]  We're using a different camera tonight. Hopefully that works out pretty well for us in general.
[24.00 --> 26.00]  How's that look? Looks pretty good?
[26.00 --> 27.00]  It's better, at least.
[27.00 --> 30.00]  See, it's that versus that. That's like way better, right?
[30.00 --> 35.00]  I wonder if half the problem was our settings in XSplit, because that looks much more natural.
[35.00 --> 36.00]  Probably.
[36.00 --> 39.00]  Alright, so welcome to the show, guys.
[39.00 --> 42.00]  Um, as you probably know...
[42.00 --> 45.00]  Oh, shoot. Oh, crap. This is on.
[45.00 --> 47.00]  Go away. Go away.
[47.00 --> 50.00]  There. It went away. Okay.
[50.00 --> 53.00]  Uh, okay, you know what? You talk about the end of the world.
[53.00 --> 58.00]  Um, we didn't really prepare anything for this topic, but Linus thought we should talk about the end of the world.
[58.00 --> 61.00]  By the way, my voice is a little bit messed up because I'm pretty sick.
[61.00 --> 66.00]  Uh, I probably won't be talking way too much this stream, but I will try for now.
[66.00 --> 74.00]  Um, as most of you know, it was supposed to have been said that the world ended, uh, today, I think?
[74.00 --> 76.00]  Yeah, midnight tonight or something like that.
[76.00 --> 78.00]  Midnight tonight? I thought it was just today in general.
[78.00 --> 81.00]  Uh, I think it's midnight tonight. I could be wrong, though.
[81.00 --> 87.00]  Okay, okay. So it's supposed to be midnight tonight, but then realistically it's happened a while ago, because of, like, other places in the world.
[89.00 --> 91.00]  Black screen?
[91.00 --> 96.00]  All right. Oh, oh. There we go.
[96.00 --> 99.00]  Alright. Looks like it's going well.
[99.00 --> 103.00]  Volume is a little low. People are complaining about the volume.
[103.00 --> 104.00]  It's probably my voice.
[104.00 --> 107.00]  Oh, okay. Okay! Uh, oh, where's our remote thing?
[108.00 --> 112.00]  You got it.
[112.00 --> 117.44]  Okay, so the end of the world. Stupidest thing I ever heard. Discuss.
[117.44 --> 120.32]  I agree. So this is not going to be that interesting of a discussion.
[120.68 --> 125.22]  But there's multiple things like other places on the planet being at different time zones
[125.22 --> 130.32]  and the fact that leap years exist, which kind of made it bullcrap anyways.
[131.38 --> 137.42]  No, but I thought that the leap year compensation, I thought this is the one that factors in the leap year compensation.
[137.56 --> 139.22]  My calendar, they didn't have leap years then.
[139.54 --> 141.76]  Right, but I thought the world was supposed to end a while ago.
[142.64 --> 144.42]  And then they were like, oh, but wait.
[145.32 --> 146.04]  I don't think so.
[146.04 --> 150.92]  I mean, the thing is that it's not real scientists that are predicting this kind of thing.
[151.48 --> 154.62]  I like Neil deGrasse Tyson. Have you ever heard of him?
[155.26 --> 156.74]  I've heard of him, yeah, yeah.
[156.84 --> 158.74]  He sent out a tweet and he was like, don't worry, guys.
[158.74 --> 161.52]  If the world was going to end, I would tell you how and I would tell you when.
[162.22 --> 162.54]  Excellent.
[162.82 --> 163.64]  I was like, yes.
[163.66 --> 164.06]  Yes.
[166.18 --> 167.16]  That is terrific.
[167.90 --> 170.34]  I'm just going to move this so that I can actually see the screen.
[170.34 --> 170.86]  Sorry, guys.
[170.94 --> 175.24]  We had to tear apart the studio a little bit last weekend.
[175.70 --> 179.52]  And then we're going to have to sort of tear apart again this weekend.
[180.36 --> 185.64]  And yeah, things have gotten pretty real over the last little bit for Linus Tech Tips.
[185.64 --> 189.92]  I'm actually working on my computer again, which is pretty nice.
[190.12 --> 192.36]  I would show you guys the progress, but...
[192.36 --> 194.18]  Oh, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
[194.76 --> 196.74]  Yeah, I see it. No, no, it's okay. I'm not going to move it anywhere.
[197.00 --> 198.32]  We're good. We're good. It's all good.
[198.32 --> 202.06]  So something, something.
[202.14 --> 211.44]  Right. I can't show it to you because I have actually packed it up and I have put it in a box and I'm shipping it out Monday for the powder coating.
[211.44 --> 219.96]  And so basically I figure if nothing else, I will have at least made progress on my computer before the world ends.
[220.42 --> 228.36]  So I'd love to take some tweets on what you guys are doing tonight in preparation for the end of the world.
[228.58 --> 230.90]  So here, we're going to throw Twitter up here.
[231.00 --> 234.36]  We're going to have a look at what people have to say about this.
[234.36 --> 239.22]  Ahem. Wouldn't the end of the world as predicted by the Mayans have to be in their time zone?
[241.30 --> 245.54]  Presumably, yes. I don't know. Did the Mayans have the whole time zone concept down?
[245.66 --> 246.94]  I really, really don't think so.
[247.96 --> 249.90]  But they did know things like, you know...
[249.90 --> 254.74]  But then it would have been like the sun coming up, so it would still be time zone.
[255.46 --> 258.24]  So he does have a point, although it's not exactly a time zone.
[258.36 --> 259.64]  Okay, presumably, yes, then.
[259.64 --> 261.70]  Okay, so presumably, yes.
[261.70 --> 265.14]  I mean, we're talking about very pseudoscience at this point.
[265.30 --> 266.68]  Whole end of the world nonsense.
[266.98 --> 270.38]  Anyway, but Tom says, why is shipping to Australia so expensive?
[271.66 --> 274.22]  Because fuel costs a lot of money.
[275.20 --> 279.78]  And the thing about Australia is that shipping is by air.
[281.00 --> 282.22]  And it's a long flight.
[283.54 --> 284.82]  And fuel is expensive.
[284.82 --> 293.46]  I mean, the exceptions are places like China and Hong Kong, where they, for whatever reason, have like the cheapest post.
[293.54 --> 296.02]  I mean, you know that Deal Extreme ships everything out of Asia, right?
[296.80 --> 299.68]  And you can buy stuff for like $2 that has free shipping.
[299.80 --> 301.04]  And I'm just kind of looking at this going, what?
[301.18 --> 306.70]  Well, if you look into a lot of it, like a lot of it, like someone was recommending that I get an aluminum backing for my S3.
[306.70 --> 310.28]  And I can get one off eBay, and it's like $3.
[310.70 --> 314.46]  And then postage is like $0.50 or $1 or something.
[314.80 --> 316.72]  But they send it to you labeled as a gift.
[317.52 --> 318.92]  Yeah, but even that doesn't make a difference.
[319.20 --> 323.80]  Because the postage still costs the same for that item regardless.
[324.28 --> 327.72]  The only thing they're saving you money on is the import and duties.
[328.08 --> 328.18]  Right.
[328.18 --> 332.72]  So, no, they actually are legit paying $0.50 or $1 for shipping.
[333.14 --> 338.08]  So, I don't quite understand how any of that works.
[338.18 --> 346.02]  Because the reality of it is, the prices of like fossil fuels are dictated by forces that go beyond like cheap labor.
[346.36 --> 346.56]  Yeah.
[347.08 --> 349.22]  So, yeah, I don't quite get that.
[349.22 --> 353.02]  I don't know why it's cheap in some places, but I do understand why it's expensive.
[353.38 --> 354.28]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[354.28 --> 356.76]  I just built a new computer for my brother.
[356.96 --> 358.20]  It plays League on the highest settings.
[358.30 --> 359.54]  It crashes after about 30 minutes.
[359.76 --> 360.26]  Any tips?
[361.04 --> 362.04]  You're the League player here.
[363.50 --> 365.58]  Plays League on the highest settings for about 30 minutes.
[366.02 --> 367.12]  I have no idea.
[367.90 --> 368.36]  Okay, then.
[368.82 --> 370.32]  Is it stressing out his computer?
[370.50 --> 371.80]  Like, we need way more information.
[371.96 --> 372.70]  Yeah, we need more.
[372.74 --> 373.24]  You know what?
[373.30 --> 374.90]  That's actually, that's a good idea.
[374.90 --> 380.22]  You know, what you should find out is you should be monitoring your temps using real temp as well as MSI afterburner.
[380.36 --> 381.82]  Check your CPU and your GPU temps.
[381.82 --> 384.26]  If something's overheating, that can be a symptom.
[384.52 --> 385.52]  Prime 95 it.
[385.98 --> 386.18]  Yeah.
[386.32 --> 387.80]  Make sure the system's actually stable.
[387.94 --> 388.32]  Prime it.
[388.42 --> 389.06]  Mem test it.
[389.28 --> 396.88]  Because it could be that something that happens, like when you're 30 minutes into a game, there's probably, I don't know, more stuff going on.
[397.14 --> 398.06]  Like, I haven't played League.
[398.74 --> 398.94]  Yeah.
[398.94 --> 400.34]  But, you know, more of the map is open.
[400.44 --> 402.30]  More team fights, a lot more graphics going on and whatnot.
[402.42 --> 403.42]  More particle effects.
[403.42 --> 407.38]  Like, it's possible that there's some kind of instability with the system that is being triggered by that.
[408.34 --> 409.70]  Or it could even be leaking RAM.
[411.46 --> 412.18]  Oh, that's true.
[412.28 --> 412.46]  Memory.
[412.58 --> 413.76]  But that would be a software issue.
[414.00 --> 414.90]  So probably not a bad word.
[414.92 --> 417.24]  Yeah, but that's still something to test.
[417.44 --> 419.46]  So you should monitor your memory usage as well.
[420.34 --> 421.56]  Ditching work to watch your live stream.
[421.62 --> 423.34]  Hello from Indonesia and hello back, Indonesia.
[423.46 --> 423.84]  Good work.
[424.70 --> 425.00]  Yes.
[425.56 --> 425.92]  All right.
[426.76 --> 428.88]  What are you guys going to get on the Steam Winter Sale?
[429.04 --> 429.86]  Have you checked it out yet?
[430.34 --> 431.14]  I honestly haven't.
[431.24 --> 431.88]  I've been way too busy.
[431.98 --> 432.94]  I haven't looked at it at all.
[432.94 --> 434.02]  I will check it out, but I haven't yet.
[434.14 --> 437.86]  Guys, I guarantee you that Slick and I will be less busy soon.
[438.38 --> 442.16]  And things will get a lot more lax.
[442.96 --> 446.54]  Nathan says, I know Slick is a hacker, but do you do any programming, Linus?
[446.56 --> 447.64]  The answer would be no.
[448.64 --> 453.34]  I can barely put bold tags on HTML input.
[453.34 --> 456.58]  So, shut up.
[459.96 --> 462.20]  I don't even think that showed up because you Twitter box.
[462.90 --> 463.28]  It's okay.
[463.72 --> 463.98]  Yeah.
[464.10 --> 469.24]  Yeah, he gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder, which I, of course, interpreted as being purely
[469.24 --> 469.74]  platonic.
[470.88 --> 472.72]  Oh, I mean, the box will probably hide this too.
[473.06 --> 473.72]  Oh, whoops.
[473.78 --> 473.98]  Sorry.
[474.06 --> 474.26]  Sorry.
[474.34 --> 474.50]  Sorry.
[474.56 --> 476.34]  I didn't mean for that to...
[478.12 --> 480.28]  My grandpa's probably watching this live stream.
[480.44 --> 480.94]  Hi, grandpa.
[483.34 --> 486.58]  Hey, Slick, is there anything you can recommend for a new Android user?
[486.78 --> 490.40]  Why don't you handle that one while I go get a jacket because I'm freaking freezing.
[490.58 --> 490.70]  Okay.
[490.92 --> 491.82]  It's cold in here.
[492.24 --> 496.78]  First off, if you're a gamer, if you haven't already heard of Humble Bundle, Humble Bundle
[496.78 --> 497.52]  is kind of amazing.
[497.84 --> 502.08]  It's a really cheap way to get a lot of games and support charity, which is just awesome.
[502.08 --> 502.18]  On Android?
[502.80 --> 503.82]  Humble Bundle for Android.
[504.02 --> 504.12]  Yeah.
[504.18 --> 504.36]  Okay.
[504.36 --> 506.80]  They've got Humble Bundle for a bunch of different things.
[506.92 --> 507.86]  There's Humble Indie Bundle.
[507.96 --> 509.84]  Recently, there's Humble THQ Bundle.
[509.94 --> 510.80]  But that can't be Android.
[511.32 --> 512.18]  No, no, no.
[512.18 --> 512.26]  Yeah.
[513.56 --> 515.94]  But then they have specific Android packages.
[516.14 --> 521.00]  So every once in a while, I think the most recent one was Humble Android Bundle 4.
[521.72 --> 522.76]  So I picked that up.
[523.00 --> 524.16]  And just give me one second.
[524.26 --> 525.88]  I'll figure out what games it came with.
[525.88 --> 531.72]  It was super cheap because the whole idea is that it's not that expensive, but you can
[531.72 --> 532.84]  pay however much you want.
[534.16 --> 536.36]  So some people pay tons of money.
[536.46 --> 537.54]  It supports charity and all that kind of stuff.
[537.62 --> 541.02]  Some people, like students and whatnot, maybe won't pay quite as much money.
[541.54 --> 545.50]  But then the companies that develop the games and the charities still make a lot of money
[545.50 --> 547.00]  because there's so many sales that go through.
[548.24 --> 549.14]  Sorry for my voice.
[549.22 --> 550.18]  I'm quite sick right now.
[551.06 --> 555.40]  So in Humble Android Bundle 4, which is, I believe, the one that I'm talking about,
[555.88 --> 563.32]  I got Crayon Physics Deluxe, Euphoria HD, Splice, Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery, Walking Mars,
[563.74 --> 571.02]  Machinarium, Cannabalt, Avedon the Black Fortress, Cogs, Zenbound 2, and Sword and Soldiers HD.
[571.68 --> 573.86]  That's a lot of games and I got it for like six bucks.
[574.06 --> 575.08]  So that's actually pretty epic.
[577.00 --> 579.06]  Another big thing is SwiftKey.
[579.66 --> 581.06]  SwiftKey 3 is what I'm running.
[581.22 --> 583.86]  I believe there's a new one called SwiftKey Flow or something like that.
[583.86 --> 586.38]  It's just a keyboard app, but it's amazing.
[586.62 --> 587.94]  It's so, so, so, so, so good.
[588.08 --> 589.30]  I recommend that completely.
[589.76 --> 594.08]  It learns from like your Twitter, your Facebook, your email and all that kind of stuff.
[594.14 --> 595.26]  And it'll learn how you type.
[595.40 --> 596.04]  So it'll learn.
[596.74 --> 598.04]  Are you talking about that keyboard?
[598.20 --> 598.74]  SwiftKey, yeah.
[598.84 --> 599.36]  Yeah, good work.
[599.36 --> 603.50]  So it'll learn as you type things that you commonly type.
[603.58 --> 606.48]  So it's autocorrects are more tuned for you, which is kind of cool.
[606.68 --> 610.54]  And it's hilarious because it has predictive text every single time you press spacebar.
[610.92 --> 616.20]  So if you just open a new message and just spam spacebar, you get to see like what it thinks you would probably say,
[616.62 --> 617.70]  which can be hilarious.
[617.84 --> 619.02]  And you can start it with the different words.
[619.08 --> 620.92]  You can start with like the instead of just nothing.
[620.92 --> 624.90]  And it'll go off of the and try and figure out what you would say if all you type was the.
[625.14 --> 626.46]  You can just press it like 30 times.
[626.88 --> 627.30]  I don't know.
[627.76 --> 628.94]  Means nothing, but it's hilarious.
[629.06 --> 629.82]  But that's a great app.
[632.32 --> 634.12]  Go SMS Pro is an awesome messaging app.
[634.18 --> 638.50]  It makes it so that if someone messages you and then you unlock your phone,
[639.28 --> 642.58]  instead of going into the messaging app, it's just immediately on the screen.
[642.86 --> 646.42]  And you can just press into the text box and type right there and click send.
[646.56 --> 647.96]  So you don't have to open the app or anything.
[648.42 --> 648.96]  Which is pretty cool.
[649.02 --> 650.30]  It has a lot of other features as well.
[650.30 --> 652.68]  So, okay, let's do our main big topic for the night.
[652.98 --> 654.30]  Our first big topic for the night.
[654.52 --> 658.10]  We didn't talk about this last week and we feel really bad about it.
[658.60 --> 659.12]  We do, right?
[659.34 --> 660.72]  This is mainly your fault, but yes.
[661.28 --> 662.30]  How is it my fault?
[662.34 --> 662.90]  I was in finals.
[663.00 --> 663.70]  I had no topics.
[663.88 --> 664.78]  You're the only one with topics.
[665.10 --> 666.64]  Well, yeah, I had topics.
[667.50 --> 668.04]  Who's fault?
[668.04 --> 668.28]  Okay.
[669.42 --> 675.80]  There was a rumor last week that Intel and NVIDIA were potentially looking at, you know,
[675.80 --> 686.86]  acquiring or merging or somehow becoming a conglomerated company of the two with Jensen Huang at the head as the CEO.
[686.86 --> 692.06]  So, I guess ramifications of that.
[692.68 --> 693.74]  What's your initial thought?
[694.38 --> 694.82]  Besides.
[696.66 --> 699.14]  Yeah, but that in like a scared tone.
[699.32 --> 701.06]  Not necessarily just a holy crap tone.
[701.06 --> 709.24]  Because they both seem to be choking back on the whole overclocking idea and the whole do-it-yourself idea.
[710.32 --> 712.36]  Okay, well here, we should flesh that out a little bit more.
[712.44 --> 713.80]  So, start with how what Intel's doing.
[713.88 --> 715.06]  Because they brought...
[715.06 --> 716.64]  I'm playing devil's advocate a little bit here.
[716.66 --> 717.94]  I don't necessarily disagree with you.
[717.94 --> 721.32]  But they brought K-series CPUs to market in the last little while.
[721.32 --> 729.24]  So, they brought back multiplier unlocks, which were gone since the P4 days.
[730.24 --> 731.60]  P4s had locked multipliers.
[731.82 --> 735.14]  So, before that, early P4s didn't have locked multipliers.
[735.30 --> 736.00]  And then I think the...
[736.00 --> 738.16]  Or, no, was it P3s even that were locked?
[738.48 --> 739.58]  I can't even remember anymore.
[739.64 --> 740.38]  It was a long time ago.
[740.60 --> 741.88]  So, they took that away.
[742.24 --> 743.76]  And now they've given it back to us.
[744.60 --> 745.30]  So, okay.
[745.38 --> 746.10]  So, they're doing that.
[746.10 --> 750.44]  Next is they've got their Intel extended warranty service thing.
[750.90 --> 755.94]  Where for, I think it's an extra 20 bucks or something, you can get an overclocking friendly warranty on your CPU.
[756.16 --> 757.88]  Where they'll replace it, no questions asked.
[762.46 --> 763.28]  All great.
[763.60 --> 764.88]  And a lot of it's marketing.
[765.08 --> 767.00]  But at the same time, they're...
[767.00 --> 771.32]  Like, if any of you have seen the leaked specs for their next launch.
[771.78 --> 773.38]  Like, it's...
[773.38 --> 775.28]  They're not tuning it towards gamers.
[775.28 --> 776.64]  They're not tuning it towards enthusiasts.
[776.88 --> 778.42]  They're not producing for the enthusiasts anymore.
[778.52 --> 782.64]  Yeah, they have these side things like unlocked multipliers and a little bit of extra warranty.
[782.86 --> 783.28]  But there's no, like...
[784.10 --> 785.64]  But that's speculation, too.
[786.20 --> 788.18]  The IPCs could be through the roof.
[788.48 --> 790.36]  But Ivy's was pretty much...
[790.36 --> 794.68]  Like, I know a lot of people that had 2,600Ks did not care when Ivy Bridge came out.
[795.78 --> 796.08]  Okay.
[796.22 --> 796.70]  That's true.
[796.80 --> 800.74]  But, bearing in mind, Ivy was a talk or whichever one is just...
[800.74 --> 801.96]  It was just a process shrink.
[802.08 --> 802.90]  Tick, tock, tick, tock.
[802.90 --> 808.04]  The fact that we got any IPC improvements at all should have been great.
[809.34 --> 809.74]  Right.
[809.92 --> 810.78]  And we did get some.
[810.84 --> 811.92]  We got 10 to 15%.
[811.92 --> 816.26]  So it's not that Intel is necessarily pulling back on the innovation.
[816.72 --> 818.78]  We haven't seen anything like Conroe in a while, though.
[819.26 --> 819.58]  Yeah.
[819.58 --> 824.68]  And, like, there's pretty solid speculation on the next release.
[825.42 --> 825.82]  Yeah.
[826.38 --> 826.74]  Okay.
[827.22 --> 831.98]  Like, it's from pretty reasonable, consistently accurate sources.
[832.24 --> 837.42]  I mean, I would go as far as to say that Haswell looks really good for something like a Steambox, though.
[837.78 --> 838.08]  Yeah?
[838.22 --> 839.14]  Like a big picture Steambox.
[839.14 --> 842.44]  But it's not for really high-end enthusiasts, which is what I care about.
[842.68 --> 842.94]  Okay.
[843.62 --> 843.92]  Okay.
[844.28 --> 846.70]  So what has NVIDIA done to run you in the last little while?
[847.96 --> 849.92]  More than Intel, to be completely honest.
[850.28 --> 850.48]  Okay.
[850.90 --> 859.94]  Just completely dropping all their warranty support for partners that want to include overclocking features, like MSI's triple overvoltage.
[859.94 --> 861.50]  Okay, they cut it back, though.
[862.16 --> 863.24]  They didn't drop it.
[863.40 --> 863.80]  They cut it back.
[863.80 --> 864.86]  They're still allowed to overvolt.
[865.38 --> 866.12]  But not.
[866.42 --> 867.26]  But not as much.
[867.40 --> 867.60]  Yeah.
[867.90 --> 870.66]  And remember, AMD, actually, I talked to AMD about this.
[871.00 --> 875.28]  I don't know if I told you this, but I talked to AMD about Greenlight, and I was just like, have you guys heard of this?
[875.38 --> 877.50]  You know, what are the board partners saying?
[877.90 --> 880.40]  And they were like, no, we haven't heard of this.
[880.40 --> 884.38]  This is the particular guy I was talking to, and he was like, well, we have restrictions, too.
[885.32 --> 885.40]  Yeah.
[885.86 --> 891.72]  So they both do it, but Greenlight has just become a little bit more restrictive.
[892.18 --> 892.38]  Yeah.
[892.62 --> 892.90]  Okay.
[893.10 --> 897.12]  But that's an avenue that they're going down.
[897.30 --> 897.52]  Okay.
[897.66 --> 900.14]  If they continue going down that avenue, in my opinion, that's bad.
[900.24 --> 903.54]  And when they come together, things like that would probably happen faster.
[903.80 --> 904.06]  Okay.
[904.48 --> 906.76]  Okay, what else has NVIDIA done to make you all but hurt?
[907.86 --> 909.08]  Well, that's mainly it.
[909.30 --> 909.88]  That's mainly it.
[909.98 --> 910.06]  Okay.
[910.06 --> 916.74]  And then, like, I find separation in companies is usually just a better thing in general for consumer.
[917.16 --> 918.72]  Maybe not for them, but for us.
[918.94 --> 921.20]  What about the technology they could deliver, though?
[921.20 --> 939.14]  Like, what if Intel and NVIDIA, between NVIDIA's strength in ARM development and GPU on the mobile side, on the notebook side, and I don't, I mean, notebook is technically mobile, but, like, smartphones and tablets, mobile and desktops.
[939.14 --> 942.06]  What could that expertise bring us?
[942.14 --> 946.56]  Because you look at sort of, everyone was really excited about the AMD ATI acquisition.
[947.24 --> 947.34]  Yeah.
[947.34 --> 954.24]  And the problem was that nothing enthusiast-grade really emerged from it.
[954.40 --> 959.24]  But I think we can agree APU is cool for a budget enthusiast.
[959.70 --> 969.48]  If you were actually on the kind of budget that would dictate an APU purchase, would you be pretty excited that you can get graphics performance that's literally double what you can get from Intel?
[969.48 --> 970.34]  Yeah, for sure.
[970.68 --> 971.66]  That's a thing.
[971.80 --> 975.98]  But then, like, with Intel and NVIDIA, yeah, they could release good things like that.
[976.76 --> 978.06]  Which would be great for big picture.
[978.48 --> 978.86]  It would.
[978.92 --> 980.08]  It would be great for stuff like big picture.
[980.08 --> 984.78]  It could resurrect PC gaming as we, maybe not as we know it, but compared to console.
[985.04 --> 990.16]  These are all good possible things, but then a bad possible thing is that they could just outright kill AMD ATI.
[992.12 --> 994.16]  Again, I don't think they would want to.
[994.42 --> 997.64]  No, but they're already doing it without really necessarily wanting to.
[997.68 --> 998.56]  Without teaming up.
[999.48 --> 1002.64]  Which is scary, because you want that AMD ATI.
[1002.78 --> 1003.66]  You want that competitor.
[1003.82 --> 1004.80]  Hopefully they get bigger.
[1005.94 --> 1007.98]  But you want a competitor of some sort.
[1008.60 --> 1008.90]  Right.
[1009.02 --> 1010.62]  We want a competitor of some sort.
[1010.78 --> 1011.06]  Okay.
[1011.78 --> 1014.66]  And, like, Atom, yeah, whatever, so they're not going to become a monopoly.
[1014.86 --> 1017.26]  But you want a, like, market competitor.
[1018.56 --> 1018.96]  Okay.
[1019.12 --> 1023.14]  Well, I'm done playing devil's advocate now, so I guess I'll express what would be my biggest concern.
[1023.54 --> 1027.20]  Like, I don't really see the direction they're headed in terms of development as a problem.
[1027.20 --> 1036.54]  Because I am, and this isn't going to be popular, but I am, I'm kind of on the side of these companies in some ways.
[1036.54 --> 1042.86]  Where I'm saying, you know what, we actually have enough computing power right now on a CPU for our mainstream user.
[1043.14 --> 1043.92]  I think it's enough.
[1043.92 --> 1046.00]  I think it's enough for the next five years at least.
[1047.44 --> 1052.26]  Whereas what I want to see is I want to see the PC mature as a platform.
[1053.18 --> 1055.92]  As a consistent experience.
[1057.44 --> 1057.70]  Right.
[1057.78 --> 1060.66]  But you can develop stuff for both ends of the spectrum.
[1060.92 --> 1064.18]  Like, it's, they seem to be narrowing their product scopes at the same time.
[1064.18 --> 1070.04]  And, like, you can say that, but then there's always going to be the people like me, and I think like you.
[1070.12 --> 1070.24]  Yep.
[1070.70 --> 1071.74]  That are going to want to play.
[1071.74 --> 1073.30]  Hey, you know what my PC spec is.
[1073.52 --> 1074.26]  No, yeah, exactly.
[1074.40 --> 1075.70]  But, like, look at the car aspect.
[1076.22 --> 1078.38]  People build cars that are incredibly fast.
[1078.46 --> 1083.20]  People buy cars that are incredibly fast, and they will never be able to use because it's flat out illegal.
[1084.16 --> 1084.48]  Okay.
[1084.92 --> 1085.18]  Okay.
[1085.28 --> 1091.46]  Either way, I agree that I don't have a problem with, because I don't think they're making a you-go here.
[1091.46 --> 1097.68]  Like, I think that Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge, Haswell, I think all of these architectures are very compelling.
[1098.52 --> 1103.30]  And, I mean, Intel also has to adapt to the slower upgrade cycle of the desktop computer.
[1103.92 --> 1110.32]  So, while they could, if everyone was upgrading their computer every two to three years, they could develop a new CPU every two to three years.
[1110.36 --> 1111.72]  Because all those people are going to come by it.
[1111.86 --> 1119.88]  Whereas if people have slid into a five, six year upgrade cycle, before they make a dramatic, before they even need a dramatic change in performance.
[1119.88 --> 1125.50]  We're talking five years into the last one they made, and people are still kind of just getting to upgrade to that.
[1125.84 --> 1129.24]  Like, you're obviously not, why do you even need to develop anything new?
[1129.26 --> 1131.78]  Because you still have plenty of customers who are going to buy what you developed.
[1132.18 --> 1134.28]  So, I mean, I think it's a response to that.
[1134.62 --> 1136.20]  I think, again, it's not a you-go.
[1136.66 --> 1143.58]  It's more like a Civic, where it's a perfectly functional vehicle that's perfectly good for, you know, even if you want to go fast once in a while.
[1143.58 --> 1146.02]  You know, you've got the SI model of K-Series SI.
[1146.80 --> 1153.82]  My problem with all of this is the, is that longer development cycle.
[1154.18 --> 1157.56]  And I don't know if it's anything that either Intel or NVIDIA can control.
[1157.86 --> 1162.22]  But it seems like they're the ones that are most complacent.
[1162.80 --> 1164.28]  If you look back historically.
[1164.28 --> 1169.46]  So, Jensen, who would be the visionary leader, and he's a visionary leader, there's no doubt.
[1169.88 --> 1181.22]  Having met him only once, I got the honor of sitting at his table when I was at an NVIDIA thing for about 45 minutes.
[1181.76 --> 1186.74]  Just kind of chatting with him a little bit, listening to him talk about the industry and all that kind of stuff.
[1186.84 --> 1189.26]  Sort of in a more intimate setting, not on a stage.
[1189.26 --> 1194.06]  It was very, it was awesome, because he's a pioneer in so many ways.
[1194.42 --> 1197.36]  But, you know, Jensen, if you're watching, you know, you're cool.
[1201.02 --> 1202.50]  So, so him at the helm.
[1203.26 --> 1205.90]  But you look at what they did with something like 8800.
[1206.90 --> 1213.54]  8800 is a great example of when NVIDIA, like, came out of the door just kicking ass and taking names.
[1213.66 --> 1217.12]  8800 destroyed 2900 XT.
[1217.12 --> 1219.82]  Just was like, yeah, whatever.
[1220.50 --> 1226.32]  It was so good that it was still good enough, like, one and a half generations later.
[1226.92 --> 1232.14]  So NVIDIA released the same thing as 9800 GTX.
[1232.28 --> 1236.98]  Then the same thing as a talk as a 9800 GTX Plus.
[1237.36 --> 1238.52]  Just as a die shrink.
[1239.20 --> 1242.92]  Then they released a flagship GPU that was just two of them together.
[1243.30 --> 1244.48]  9800 GX2.
[1244.48 --> 1248.60]  And that was over a course of a very long period of time.
[1248.66 --> 1254.24]  They didn't replace 8800 GTX with Ultra until I think 9 or 10 months into the cycle.
[1255.32 --> 1257.58]  Because AMD had nothing to respond with.
[1257.94 --> 1262.68]  So what I don't like about an AMD, and you look at Intel's complacency with P4.
[1262.68 --> 1268.56]  They were so far ahead of Barton that they were just, like, they were just releasing, like, you know, new Northwood cores.
[1268.90 --> 1273.34]  They were calling these architecturals shifts when all they were doing was bumping the frontside bus.
[1273.42 --> 1275.20]  There wasn't even a performance difference.
[1276.16 --> 1279.20]  Northwood B and C is, like, nothing.
[1279.20 --> 1284.16]  Actually, Northwood A, for that matter, isn't that far off.
[1284.22 --> 1287.92]  We're talking clock speed bumps and, like, you know, cash tweaks here.
[1288.96 --> 1294.32]  So looking back historically, both of these guys are very complacent when nothing happens.
[1294.32 --> 1303.44]  So we'd be taking the two most complacent guys who are already in positions of power, putting them in a position of undisputable power over almost everything.
[1303.70 --> 1304.02]  Oh, yeah.
[1304.22 --> 1308.78]  I mean, we discussed Tegra 4 a little bit today, which is going to be 6x the performance of Tegra 3.
[1308.78 --> 1315.96]  Bearing in mind that, you know, the only real competitor for Tegra right now is going to be, what is it, Crate?
[1316.90 --> 1317.70]  Who is that?
[1318.46 --> 1319.18]  Can't remember.
[1319.44 --> 1320.76]  I know that's the codename.
[1320.86 --> 1321.82]  Yeah, codename Crate.
[1322.44 --> 1325.56]  So they only have a couple real competitors left.
[1325.66 --> 1326.74]  TI's already backed off.
[1328.16 --> 1332.56]  And then Apple's the only other one that's really relevant, but they're always going to be that closed platform anyway.
[1333.16 --> 1335.38]  You know, hippies like you will never be interested in.
[1335.38 --> 1338.92]  So they're going to have that.
[1339.72 --> 1342.46]  They're going to have on the notebook.
[1342.90 --> 1352.04]  I mean, you look at what Intel does with something like an Ultrabook branding, where they lock it down to a CPU, a chipset, a wireless chipset, and a form factor.
[1353.50 --> 1354.54]  And a GPU.
[1355.18 --> 1356.06]  They're going to add that.
[1356.52 --> 1364.54]  However, the experience will be better because something like NVIDIA Optimus, which allows the switchable graphics, is going to be that much cleaner.
[1364.54 --> 1373.56]  In fact, you'll probably have an NVIDIA GeForce chip in sort of two, three years from now on the CPU itself, which would actually be kind of freaking awesome.
[1373.82 --> 1373.94]  Yeah.
[1374.06 --> 1375.66]  Like, there's a lot of cool stuff that they could do.
[1376.06 --> 1381.16]  I just worry about market dominance and complacency and all that kind of stuff that you said.
[1381.30 --> 1386.14]  There's like no desire to push the enthusiast side, which worries me a lot.
[1386.14 --> 1393.38]  I mean, you look at even something like, you look at how quickly NVIDIA rolled out 580 versus 480 because 480 wasn't competitive.
[1393.86 --> 1395.44]  They can turn it on when they want to.
[1395.52 --> 1396.50]  However, it was very expensive.
[1396.66 --> 1398.68]  It cost them a fortune to do it.
[1398.68 --> 1403.04]  So they're capable of like executing, but without the prodding.
[1403.90 --> 1406.36]  We've been sitting on 680 for a while now.
[1407.72 --> 1410.98]  And 780 is going to come kind of sort of whenever.
[1411.80 --> 1417.06]  And, you know, they had a chip they could have released as a 680 or a 685.
[1417.32 --> 1418.02]  They've been sitting on it.
[1418.06 --> 1419.06]  It's a Tesla right now.
[1419.06 --> 1423.56]  That could just as easily be a GeForce GPU if they put it on a PCV with some display output.
[1423.92 --> 1427.14]  So, but it's much more expensive to produce.
[1427.32 --> 1427.46]  Oh, yeah.
[1428.28 --> 1435.78]  On the other hand, I mean, and that's the thing that I guess is frustrating for me is that it's not like an enthusiast isn't willing to pay $1,000 for a GPU.
[1435.92 --> 1436.80]  No, that's, okay.
[1436.88 --> 1439.02]  This is another thing that I meant to bring up but just totally forgot.
[1439.40 --> 1442.36]  What happened to, like, computers used to be really expensive.
[1443.00 --> 1444.38]  And people would go out and buy them.
[1444.38 --> 1448.42]  If they had, like, why not just bring out the extreme branding?
[1449.06 --> 1452.16]  But, like, actually make it extreme branding again.
[1452.76 --> 1455.72]  Instead of the, like, ever so slightly better that it is right now.
[1456.10 --> 1457.56]  Like, actually make it crush stuff.
[1457.80 --> 1459.10]  And, like, have stuff there for NVIDIA.
[1459.22 --> 1463.20]  Have stuff there for everyone where it's just, like, this crazy premier tier of just awesomeness.
[1463.28 --> 1464.22]  Economies of scale.
[1464.50 --> 1469.82]  I mean, you look at what it costs for something like an 8-core Xeon.
[1470.34 --> 1473.80]  Which really is the pinnacle of what Intel can manufacture.
[1475.28 --> 1478.36]  You know, would an enthusiast pay $2,000 or $3,000?
[1479.06 --> 1480.06]  For a CPU.
[1480.40 --> 1484.20]  If the volumes were low enough that for Intel to look at it and go,
[1484.30 --> 1486.28]  Okay, we can justify the development on this.
[1486.34 --> 1489.36]  We have to charge $3,000 per CPU.
[1490.40 --> 1491.30]  Would you today?
[1491.52 --> 1492.84]  Because I'm sure Intel could...
[1492.84 --> 1493.02]  Well, not me.
[1493.18 --> 1494.52]  But I know people that would.
[1494.66 --> 1494.84]  Okay.
[1494.84 --> 1496.58]  And I wonder how many they would need.
[1496.96 --> 1497.44]  Hypothetically.
[1497.44 --> 1501.64]  Let's say they release a CPU with a 210 or 250 watt TDP.
[1501.96 --> 1503.34]  Because no cares were given.
[1504.02 --> 1505.16]  And it's 12 cores.
[1505.48 --> 1507.90]  And it's clocked at 4.5 gigahertz.
[1508.04 --> 1510.66]  And it really is, like, the state-of-the-art modern technology.
[1510.78 --> 1513.84]  They're throwing out three quarters of the dies they produce for this thing.
[1513.88 --> 1514.98]  It costs three to four grand.
[1515.62 --> 1516.96]  How many of those could you sell?
[1517.26 --> 1519.42]  You consult people on a lot of systems.
[1519.42 --> 1521.96]  If they really could have that kind of power.
[1523.84 --> 1527.20]  Personally, I only know one guy that would move for that.
[1527.64 --> 1527.90]  Right.
[1528.02 --> 1530.76]  But then that's my circle of people and I know one guy that would move.
[1530.76 --> 1533.44]  But then I can tell you how many hundreds of 20...
[1533.44 --> 1534.92]  35, 70 Ks you can sell.
[1534.94 --> 1535.52]  Oh, exactly.
[1535.64 --> 1535.80]  Yeah.
[1535.80 --> 1538.30]  But I'm just surprised that they don't have...
[1538.30 --> 1542.66]  Like, a lot of brands, like, having that one line that doesn't necessarily make a lot of money.
[1543.06 --> 1546.36]  But just is there, like, claim to fame of just ultimate badassery.
[1546.48 --> 1547.32]  But you're already Intel.
[1547.96 --> 1549.64]  You're already the ultimate badassery.
[1549.64 --> 1549.70]  I know, I know, I know.
[1549.82 --> 1550.42]  But do you care?
[1550.52 --> 1551.44]  I want that to exist.
[1551.50 --> 1552.34]  You're already NVIDIA.
[1552.50 --> 1554.04]  You already have the GeForce experience.
[1554.24 --> 1555.48]  You already have the 690.
[1555.78 --> 1556.50]  The cream of the cream.
[1556.50 --> 1561.82]  You can already engineer a dual GPU for this current generation that AMD couldn't do.
[1561.82 --> 1566.76]  They handed off 7990 development, like, half finished, to PowerColor.
[1567.00 --> 1568.52]  They were just like, we can't do this.
[1568.72 --> 1569.92]  We give up.
[1570.40 --> 1572.92]  That's why PowerColor is the only 7990 manufacturer.
[1573.30 --> 1576.98]  So, I don't know.
[1576.98 --> 1577.34]  I don't know.
[1578.00 --> 1578.22]  Okay.
[1578.30 --> 1580.32]  We really have no idea until it's released.
[1580.60 --> 1581.12]  Do a couple...
[1581.12 --> 1582.80]  And, yeah, we'll talk about this more.
[1583.02 --> 1585.72]  Maybe, you know, if that rumor becomes more concrete.
[1585.94 --> 1587.40]  Because right now I'm kind of looking at it.
[1587.44 --> 1588.12]  I'm very skeptical.
[1588.72 --> 1591.34]  But here, do you want to do a couple tweets while I find our next topic?
[1591.82 --> 1592.06]  Sure.
[1592.18 --> 1593.46]  Because I do have a few new topics.
[1593.58 --> 1594.92]  I don't have any way to scroll.
[1595.44 --> 1596.02]  It's right here.
[1596.60 --> 1597.44]  Just arrow keys.
[1601.66 --> 1602.24]  Oh, right.
[1602.34 --> 1605.28]  You go up to the top and just see if we've gotten a...
[1605.28 --> 1606.72]  Yeah, 170 new tweets.
[1607.32 --> 1607.74]  So, yeah.
[1609.32 --> 1611.26]  People apparently do want to discuss this.
[1615.26 --> 1616.44]  I don't know how to say your name.
[1616.50 --> 1617.04]  I'm very sorry.
[1617.04 --> 1620.20]  It is technically possible to recover raw data from an SSD.
[1620.58 --> 1622.26]  But it's very unlikely.
[1622.82 --> 1624.60]  And much, much, much, much, much harder.
[1624.90 --> 1629.20]  And many times I've had data recovery guys tell me, for all intents and purposes, it's impossible.
[1629.46 --> 1629.68]  Yeah.
[1629.90 --> 1631.64]  Like, I wouldn't bother.
[1631.90 --> 1633.16]  Like, technically, yes.
[1633.22 --> 1634.48]  But I wouldn't bother even trying.
[1634.72 --> 1635.64]  Like, it's something that...
[1635.64 --> 1635.86]  Sorry.
[1635.96 --> 1636.14]  Okay.
[1636.16 --> 1637.20]  I'll go check a topic after.
[1637.20 --> 1639.64]  Something that they could do is they could re-solder...
[1639.64 --> 1642.64]  Like, if the controller dies, they could re-solder the controller.
[1642.82 --> 1642.94]  Yeah.
[1643.16 --> 1643.86]  And maybe.
[1644.40 --> 1646.92]  But understand that the way SSDs store data...
[1646.92 --> 1648.24]  Even that actually might not work.
[1648.56 --> 1653.82]  Because SSDs inherently write to the flash as randomly as possible.
[1654.30 --> 1660.74]  So, it's not like an SD card where you could take that flash chip, put it into a reader, and pull the data off.
[1660.74 --> 1664.60]  And even then, that's really hard because of the style of data.
[1664.96 --> 1667.90]  Hard disks are not that bad to recover stuff from.
[1668.20 --> 1668.68]  Flash.
[1668.68 --> 1670.02]  Any other type of...
[1670.02 --> 1670.92]  It's just not...
[1670.92 --> 1671.80]  Back up your data.
[1672.02 --> 1672.22]  Sorry.
[1672.40 --> 1672.80]  I'll be back.
[1677.48 --> 1678.80]  Are you excited for CES?
[1678.92 --> 1680.74]  Yes, I'm ridiculously excited for CES.
[1681.00 --> 1684.24]  My voice might not show up right now because I'm ridiculously sick as well.
[1684.50 --> 1686.40]  But CES is going to be amazing.
[1686.40 --> 1691.44]  What new or revolutionary tech is in the works?
[1691.62 --> 1693.64]  I think we will figure that out at CES.
[1694.78 --> 1696.66]  Okay, I'm going to start an argument with you.
[1699.94 --> 1707.68]  I would postulate that the optimal RPM for a fan for a modern gaming system is anywhere from 700 to 800 RPM.
[1708.68 --> 1711.88]  Is that because there's not a huge difference between that and much higher RPMs?
[1712.02 --> 1713.28]  Or is that because you don't like the sound?
[1713.44 --> 1714.22]  I don't like the sound.
[1714.34 --> 1714.70]  It's annoying.
[1714.92 --> 1715.12]  Okay.
[1716.40 --> 1717.86]  I don't care.
[1718.80 --> 1719.94]  I like my CES.
[1720.94 --> 1724.90]  For reference, I have CES AR-15s, which are the 1850 RPM.
[1724.90 --> 1727.20]  Just call them GTs like every normal person.
[1727.34 --> 1727.92]  Whatever, man.
[1728.60 --> 1730.08]  GT 1850 RPM.
[1730.16 --> 1734.26]  The only sound that really comes off them is the whirring sound of the wind.
[1734.52 --> 1735.42]  So it's very smooth.
[1735.58 --> 1737.04]  There's some motor noise.
[1737.38 --> 1737.88]  Not really.
[1738.54 --> 1739.24]  What do you mean not really?
[1739.30 --> 1739.96]  I heard them too.
[1740.04 --> 1740.86]  There's some motor noise.
[1741.04 --> 1743.58]  You hear it when you put it up to your ear, not when it's in a computer.
[1744.04 --> 1745.84]  You put enough of them together, you're going to hear it.
[1745.84 --> 1748.10]  And why do you have to hear the whooshing noise?
[1749.02 --> 1750.16]  I'm not saying you have to.
[1750.72 --> 1752.34]  I'm saying it's technically there.
[1752.46 --> 1756.54]  The second I put headphones on, which I wear headphones 100% of the time that I'm gaming,
[1756.86 --> 1759.36]  if there's any amount of noise coming through to them, I don't hear my system.
[1759.36 --> 1760.12]  Well, here's this.
[1760.60 --> 1763.96]  I would argue that it doesn't matter how loud the computer is when you're gaming,
[1764.06 --> 1765.86]  because when you're gaming, you're focused on something else.
[1765.96 --> 1766.02]  Yeah.
[1766.26 --> 1771.44]  The time when the noise matters to me is more like at idle, or when I'm working on a document,
[1771.74 --> 1775.52]  or if I'm working on something where I don't have sound constantly, like if I'm video editing.
[1776.30 --> 1779.08]  Why would I want to hear the whir of fans?
[1779.32 --> 1780.02]  I don't hear it.
[1780.02 --> 1781.50]  It's totally unnecessary, though.
[1781.96 --> 1788.38]  Tell me a modern component that will actually benefit from you putting higher than 800 RPM fans in your case.
[1788.44 --> 1789.40]  That's not the point, though.
[1789.40 --> 1793.36]  I like playing around with overclocking.
[1793.42 --> 1794.20]  I like playing around with the cooling.
[1794.36 --> 1800.08]  With those AR-15s, whatever, GTs, I can get really, really good temperatures.
[1800.64 --> 1801.44]  I like those fans.
[1801.52 --> 1802.26]  They're really good fans.
[1803.34 --> 1805.24]  The sound does not bother me at all.
[1805.36 --> 1806.12]  Why not turn them down, though?
[1806.12 --> 1807.18]  I don't mind white noise.
[1807.44 --> 1809.44]  If it could be silent, why not have it be silent?
[1809.62 --> 1810.48]  Because I don't care.
[1812.88 --> 1814.06]  I just do not care.
[1814.06 --> 1819.50]  It's a whirring, not annoying sound that's in the background.
[1819.62 --> 1820.32]  It's just white noise.
[1820.62 --> 1821.54]  We're used to white noise.
[1821.78 --> 1823.68]  If you're in absolute silence, you go crazy.
[1825.42 --> 1825.78]  Okay.
[1825.94 --> 1827.32]  And I always listen to music.
[1827.46 --> 1831.34]  Or if I'm video editing, I'm listening to the audio track that's in the background.
[1831.48 --> 1834.12]  Or if I'm playing games, I'm listening to the audio in the game or music.
[1834.46 --> 1835.94]  Or I'm sitting there talking to people on Skype.
[1836.16 --> 1837.40]  There's always sound coming through.
[1837.40 --> 1838.52]  What about people around you, then?
[1839.04 --> 1839.56]  I don't care.
[1839.56 --> 1845.56]  Okay, so basically, the only reason you could possibly disagree with me about this is because
[1845.56 --> 1846.28]  you're inconsiderate.
[1846.88 --> 1847.24]  No.
[1847.68 --> 1850.10]  It's because I don't care and literally no one else does either.
[1851.54 --> 1852.30]  Okay, fine.
[1852.36 --> 1857.50]  I challenge all the silence freaks who are watching to tweet that people do care about
[1857.50 --> 1858.18]  computer noise.
[1858.60 --> 1860.68]  Okay, then why don't you try and silence your fridge?
[1861.52 --> 1862.80]  Or anything else in your house?
[1862.80 --> 1864.10]  Your fridge only goes on sometimes.
[1864.10 --> 1864.72]  Everything makes noise.
[1865.46 --> 1865.62]  So?
[1865.96 --> 1867.48]  Isn't it more annoying that it's not consistent?
[1867.54 --> 1868.86]  I don't hang out in my kitchen.
[1869.56 --> 1872.54]  I mean, I silenced my media PC.
[1873.18 --> 1873.42]  Right?
[1873.60 --> 1874.64]  That makes more sense.
[1874.68 --> 1878.08]  I wouldn't buy a TV or an AV receiver with a fan.
[1878.84 --> 1879.12]  Right.
[1879.20 --> 1880.66]  Would you buy a TV with a fan?
[1880.90 --> 1883.06]  Who's watching TV with their desktop computer?
[1883.10 --> 1883.36]  Okay.
[1883.54 --> 1885.44]  Who's watching TV without the sound on?
[1885.58 --> 1886.34]  By your argument.
[1887.26 --> 1887.56]  What?
[1887.66 --> 1888.68]  Because if you have the sound on, you shouldn't hear the fan.
[1888.68 --> 1890.56]  No, because in movies, there's silent points.
[1891.62 --> 1891.98]  Okay.
[1892.12 --> 1893.64]  In a game, there would be a silent point.
[1894.16 --> 1895.00]  Not that often.
[1895.00 --> 1896.44]  In a video editing sequence?
[1897.40 --> 1899.02]  Video editing sequence, it doesn't really matter.
[1899.56 --> 1902.76]  Totally disagree.
[1902.94 --> 1903.56]  It's unnecessary.
[1904.46 --> 1906.18]  Why do you need the noise?
[1906.54 --> 1907.78]  It's not much noise.
[1908.28 --> 1909.50]  It's not actually loud.
[1910.52 --> 1913.56]  Oh, actually, I have another random topic before we jump into a bigger one.
[1913.56 --> 1915.28]  So, um, sorry.
[1916.06 --> 1921.80]  Mark, Mark Hammer tweeted to me that his wife is 30 months pregnant.
[1922.80 --> 1924.44]  And, 30 months, 30 weeks pregnant.
[1924.46 --> 1924.72]  I was like, whoa.
[1924.98 --> 1927.80]  Yeah, she's like, she's like this big.
[1928.06 --> 1931.64]  And she's like huge and an alien.
[1932.52 --> 1934.34]  And, no, Mark, your wife's not huge.
[1934.34 --> 1935.60]  Unless she is huge.
[1935.60 --> 1938.10]  In which case, like, sorry, man.
[1938.24 --> 1939.24]  But, um.
[1939.24 --> 1940.12]  He might like it.
[1940.26 --> 1941.08]  Yeah, you might be into that.
[1941.08 --> 1941.98]  I can't judge, dude.
[1942.24 --> 1942.48]  All right.
[1942.58 --> 1943.00]  You're right.
[1943.24 --> 1943.72]  You know what?
[1943.82 --> 1944.22]  You're right.
[1944.38 --> 1945.90]  I don't judge you for being into that.
[1949.50 --> 1950.44]  I judge him.
[1952.04 --> 1952.36]  Whatever.
[1953.04 --> 1954.68]  I'm too sick to care right now.
[1954.68 --> 1956.08]  His wife is 30 weeks pregnant.
[1956.32 --> 1957.84]  And she wants to name the baby Linus.
[1959.88 --> 1960.28]  Discuss.
[1962.62 --> 1963.06]  Okay.
[1963.78 --> 1965.58]  It has nothing to do with you, I'm guessing?
[1966.10 --> 1968.20]  No, I probably does.
[1968.42 --> 1968.72]  But, you know.
[1968.82 --> 1969.10]  Oh.
[1969.34 --> 1969.50]  Yeah.
[1969.70 --> 1970.28]  Oh, whatever.
[1970.30 --> 1971.10]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[1972.20 --> 1973.52]  He wants me to.
[1973.56 --> 1973.92]  Hold on.
[1974.42 --> 1975.54]  His tweet says,
[1976.10 --> 1979.80]  Linus, the wife is 30 weeks prego and clearly not thinking straight.
[1980.28 --> 1983.06]  Wants to call the baby Linus on the live cast.
[1983.16 --> 1984.24]  Can you unconvince her?
[1984.68 --> 1988.00]  I'd like your thoughts first.
[1988.18 --> 1991.88]  And remember, whether or not you get fired tonight could hinge on your response here.
[1992.78 --> 1994.70]  I usually get fired three times a night.
[1995.16 --> 1995.54]  That's true.
[1995.66 --> 1996.56]  You haven't fired me yet today.
[1996.58 --> 1997.64]  No, you've been fired once today.
[1997.68 --> 1998.10]  When was that?
[1998.14 --> 1998.88]  You got fired earlier.
[1999.08 --> 1999.30]  When?
[1999.46 --> 2001.84]  When you said you were going to do something that I didn't like.
[2001.88 --> 2003.10]  And I was like, well, I could just fire you.
[2003.20 --> 2003.60]  You're fired.
[2003.98 --> 2004.66]  Oh, I don't remember.
[2005.80 --> 2006.76]  That's how much I cared.
[2009.50 --> 2010.12]  I don't know.
[2010.18 --> 2010.42]  Whatever.
[2010.78 --> 2011.38]  Linus is fine.
[2012.44 --> 2013.70]  At least there's one good person.
[2013.70 --> 2015.08]  You can look up to Linus Torvalds.
[2015.28 --> 2016.72]  That's a cool person that has that name.
[2022.72 --> 2023.08]  Really?
[2023.48 --> 2024.24]  You know what?
[2024.50 --> 2026.92]  This is sort of off that topic.
[2027.42 --> 2032.10]  But I would say Linus Torvalds is far from the most important person to ever bear the name Linus.
[2032.10 --> 2032.70]  Linus.
[2032.70 --> 2033.00]  Ew.
[2033.94 --> 2034.20]  Come on.
[2034.20 --> 2034.96]  I'm sure there's more.
[2035.12 --> 2035.44]  Come on.
[2035.58 --> 2035.92]  Come on.
[2036.00 --> 2036.46]  Come on.
[2036.52 --> 2036.84]  Take a crack at this.
[2036.84 --> 2038.12]  I'm probably just not thinking of it.
[2038.38 --> 2042.10]  Basically, like the father of everything we know about vitamin C.
[2043.02 --> 2044.62]  Oh, I'm not going to remember his last name.
[2045.50 --> 2046.76]  Two Nobel Prizes.
[2046.96 --> 2047.64]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2047.72 --> 2051.30]  One of only, I think, two people to ever win two Nobel Prizes.
[2052.62 --> 2053.26]  Yeah, no, I don't remember.
[2053.26 --> 2054.54]  Okay, Linus Pauling.
[2054.64 --> 2055.08]  There we go.
[2055.18 --> 2057.62]  Who is actually the Linus for whom I'm named.
[2057.88 --> 2058.28]  Oh, really?
[2058.50 --> 2058.78]  Yes.
[2058.92 --> 2059.80]  That's actually kind of cool.
[2060.24 --> 2063.56]  Everyone assumes because I'm a dork that...
[2063.56 --> 2064.68]  It's because of Torvalds?
[2064.86 --> 2065.82]  Yeah, it's because of...
[2065.82 --> 2068.50]  So that it's because of Torvalds, but I'm like, I'm 26.
[2068.74 --> 2070.42]  Yeah, that would have been odd timing.
[2070.72 --> 2071.96]  The timing's not quite right.
[2072.16 --> 2073.32]  He's like first developing...
[2073.32 --> 2075.40]  I would even go as far as to say Torvalds is number three.
[2077.54 --> 2078.62]  Who's after...
[2078.62 --> 2081.96]  Linus Van Pelt, who basically taught us the meaning of Christmas.
[2082.94 --> 2083.22]  Oh.
[2083.96 --> 2085.86]  I didn't know.
[2086.10 --> 2086.32]  Okay.
[2086.64 --> 2087.82]  Okay, well, you know what?
[2087.82 --> 2098.44]  We're going to have to find the YouTube clip for Slick here because he clearly needs a little lesson on sort of the importance of Christmas.
[2099.02 --> 2103.06]  And since we're coming up on Christmas, and yeah, I'm calling it Christmas because holiday is stupid.
[2104.22 --> 2106.38]  Whatever holiday you're currently celebrating.
[2106.40 --> 2107.12]  Whatever holiday.
[2107.22 --> 2108.28]  I'm celebrating Christmas.
[2108.60 --> 2108.72]  Yeah.
[2110.00 --> 2112.12]  Linus, Christmas.
[2113.12 --> 2116.38]  So I would go as far as to say this is the second most important Linus.
[2116.38 --> 2118.36]  Oh, okay.
[2118.78 --> 2119.06]  Yeah.
[2119.32 --> 2119.62]  Okay.
[2119.74 --> 2121.04]  I didn't recognize the name right away.
[2121.48 --> 2122.06]  There we go.
[2122.28 --> 2123.08]  Oh, wrong one.
[2123.72 --> 2124.34]  There we go.
[2125.30 --> 2125.78]  There we go.
[2125.90 --> 2126.54]  I'm going to make it full screen.
[2126.70 --> 2127.48]  I might want it.
[2127.98 --> 2128.26]  Oh, no.
[2128.36 --> 2128.88]  It's low.
[2128.98 --> 2129.22]  It's low.
[2129.30 --> 2129.68]  It should be okay.
[2129.72 --> 2130.34]  Still, it's...
[2130.34 --> 2131.10]  There we go, guys.
[2131.22 --> 2132.90]  So this is the meaning of Christmas.
[2136.42 --> 2137.50]  We're just going to let them watch.
[2137.50 --> 2137.76]  Yeah.
[2138.06 --> 2138.60]  Yeah, I see.
[2147.60 --> 2148.72]  I sure hope there's audio.
[2149.12 --> 2149.44]  Yeah.
[2149.44 --> 2149.84]  Yeah.
[2152.72 --> 2155.02]  This would be a very stale point of the episode.
[2155.02 --> 2159.52]  So behold, I have been trying to great joy, which is me to ask you.
[2159.98 --> 2165.78]  For unto you is full in this day, and you're sitting in the world, and you're saving, which is Christ the Lord.
[2166.68 --> 2168.32]  And this will be a sign unto you.
[2168.98 --> 2172.74]  He shall find the labor after the swaddling clothes, lying in the manger.
[2173.80 --> 2178.24]  Hopefully there was with the angels, and multitude of the heavenly hosts, great in God.
[2179.12 --> 2179.64]  Thank you.
[2179.64 --> 2181.30]  Glory to God in the highest.
[2181.30 --> 2182.30]  Thank you.
[2182.30 --> 2183.30]  Thank you.
[2183.30 --> 2184.30]  Thank you.
[2184.30 --> 2185.30]  Thank you.
[2193.30 --> 2194.16]  So there you go, guys.
[2195.22 --> 2200.66]  If you're not familiar already with Linus from Charlie Brown, who is also not the Linus I'm
[2200.66 --> 2206.44]  named for, although I've had a lot of people assume that, that's the Linus Christmas monologue,
[2206.44 --> 2210.30]  which is probably not as important as Linux, but...
[2210.30 --> 2214.42]  Whatever, man.
[2218.02 --> 2219.24]  I hope there was audio.
[2220.18 --> 2220.44]  Yeah.
[2222.16 --> 2225.20]  No one's saying anything about it, so I guess it was probably okay.
[2226.28 --> 2227.46]  Christmas tips, yeah.
[2228.98 --> 2231.74]  Okay, so why don't we do some tweets for a bit here, guys?
[2231.74 --> 2236.08]  Okay, BitPhoenixRecon, Linus, Linus tips, indeed.
[2236.54 --> 2240.36]  Oh yeah, okay, speaking of other awesome Linuses, there's some soccer player, football, football,
[2240.50 --> 2243.42]  European football, over in Europe somewhere.
[2243.60 --> 2246.08]  And then there's Linus Omar, who plays for the Edmonton Oilers.
[2246.46 --> 2249.68]  Do you, like, have a catalogue of Linuses?
[2249.68 --> 2252.70]  No, but I'm sort of, I notice them.
[2253.38 --> 2256.04]  There's Linus Chan, who goes to, like, SFU or something.
[2256.96 --> 2257.18]  What?
[2257.40 --> 2257.64]  Yeah.
[2257.80 --> 2259.84]  How do you, why would you possibly know that?
[2259.90 --> 2260.20]  Facebook.
[2260.88 --> 2262.40]  I was like, how many Linuses I did?
[2262.62 --> 2262.92]  Oh.
[2263.46 --> 2263.62]  Yeah.
[2263.68 --> 2267.74]  One of my favorite things to say when I call in to, like, Shaw or something is, like,
[2268.10 --> 2270.24]  they're like, can I get your name and phone number?
[2270.24 --> 2272.58]  I'm like, yeah, you can probably search for me by name.
[2272.74 --> 2273.04]  It's okay.
[2273.60 --> 2276.84]  I'm pretty sure I'm the only Linus Sebastian, which is kind of neat.
[2278.70 --> 2279.42]  Uh, okay.
[2279.98 --> 2285.00]  So someone says, you're 26, I thought you were 30 plus.
[2285.48 --> 2286.78]  Do I look that old?
[2287.00 --> 2287.24]  No.
[2288.28 --> 2288.56]  Like.
[2290.22 --> 2291.62]  It's probably just because of your job.
[2292.72 --> 2293.02]  Oh.
[2293.20 --> 2295.48]  Because people knew you were a product manager at NCX.
[2295.76 --> 2296.22]  Oh, okay.
[2296.96 --> 2298.02]  Quiet fan solution.
[2298.12 --> 2298.84]  Quiet fan solution.
[2298.96 --> 2299.70]  Noctua F-Series.
[2299.70 --> 2304.80]  In fact, we got some for the, uh, for the, behind me here is going to be our heat sink
[2304.80 --> 2306.34]  and water cooler test bench.
[2306.58 --> 2311.96]  We are going to switch from using random fans that are included with things to only
[2311.96 --> 2318.58]  using Noctua pressure optimized fans at a fixed RPM that I find acceptable to where
[2318.58 --> 2322.90]  I would say, this is a quiet computer if you configure it like this.
[2323.00 --> 2325.48]  And that's going to be, in his terms, like silent.
[2325.80 --> 2325.92]  Yes.
[2325.92 --> 2326.78]  So that's going to be awesome.
[2326.94 --> 2327.96]  And those are great fans.
[2327.96 --> 2328.26]  Yeah.
[2328.26 --> 2334.04]  So basically what you guys can assume is that if you want a quiet computer and you
[2334.04 --> 2338.52]  get good quality fans and you buy the heat sink that I say gets these temperatures, you
[2338.52 --> 2339.86]  will be able to reproduce our results.
[2340.02 --> 2341.48]  So that's the objective there.
[2341.64 --> 2347.18]  So instead of just it being like random, then, and, and cause so often like you end up,
[2347.18 --> 2350.24]  every heat sink review ends up being the same thing.
[2350.44 --> 2350.56]  Yeah.
[2350.70 --> 2355.06]  It's like, here's the temperature reading and here's the noise reading and you have to decide
[2355.06 --> 2355.86]  what's the trade off.
[2355.90 --> 2360.40]  And it's like in decibels and you're sitting there going, well, a decibels are completely
[2360.40 --> 2363.76]  meaningless to most people because they don't really understand the scale.
[2363.96 --> 2366.42]  Remember every three decibels is a doubling of volume.
[2366.42 --> 2372.64]  Number two is that the quality of the sound is way more important than how loud it is.
[2372.64 --> 2373.08]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[2373.32 --> 2376.98]  Like a light rattle will drive me crazy.
[2377.14 --> 2378.02]  Oh yeah, 100%.
[2378.02 --> 2383.20]  But a low drone, which could actually be like louder, it's fine.
[2383.74 --> 2384.84]  Well, not fine, but.
[2385.16 --> 2385.90]  Fine to me.
[2386.08 --> 2387.40]  Rattling pisses me off too.
[2387.46 --> 2391.38]  There's a difference between, like we were talking earlier about really quiet computers
[2391.38 --> 2392.68]  and then what I was describing.
[2393.08 --> 2396.22]  There's a huge difference between what I was describing and like one that rattles.
[2396.36 --> 2398.02]  If it rattles at all, it'll piss me off.
[2398.08 --> 2402.04]  But a very consistent droning sound, I find perfectly acceptable.
[2402.08 --> 2405.02]  And I mean, lots of little fans are actually not that loud.
[2405.12 --> 2406.98]  Like the 40 mil fan on the Sabertooth.
[2406.98 --> 2408.32]  It actually does pretty okay.
[2408.46 --> 2409.06]  Not loud.
[2409.38 --> 2410.58]  Oh, I think it's annoying.
[2410.98 --> 2414.32]  Well, pretty okay for total audio, but then like you just.
[2414.86 --> 2415.68]  Very high pitched.
[2416.42 --> 2419.06]  So it travels better.
[2419.06 --> 2421.48]  Like the decibels will probably not be that high.
[2422.60 --> 2424.30]  I really don't care about fan noise.
[2424.54 --> 2427.14]  I used to run my GTX 480 with the stock cooler.
[2427.24 --> 2429.34]  Well, yeah, but the stock cooler on the 480 doesn't get that loud.
[2429.62 --> 2430.14]  It's not really loud.
[2430.22 --> 2431.10]  It's really hot.
[2431.28 --> 2431.84]  Yeah, it's okay.
[2431.98 --> 2436.00]  I mean, it's not like, you know, a 4870 X2.
[2436.00 --> 2438.14]  Like, that's a loud card.
[2439.34 --> 2440.82]  What are your favorite 120 mil fans?
[2440.94 --> 2441.72]  Noctua F-Series.
[2442.06 --> 2444.14]  Cooler for i5, 3570K.
[2444.30 --> 2445.78]  I don't know, like Hyper 212.
[2446.64 --> 2447.84]  That's the most common one.
[2447.84 --> 2448.76]  Yeah, Hyper 212.
[2448.90 --> 2450.92]  Or if you want something really nice, Noctua D14.
[2451.64 --> 2451.90]  Yeah.
[2452.36 --> 2452.76]  Yeah.
[2453.76 --> 2454.90]  Yeah, Noctua D14.
[2454.90 --> 2457.18]  Side with Slick as an audio engineer.
[2457.28 --> 2460.12]  I would silence my studio rate, but you just won't hear fan when editing anyway.
[2460.96 --> 2462.70]  What is the PNY Quadro 6000?
[2462.94 --> 2467.24]  It's a workstation graphics card for accelerating things like particle effects when you're doing
[2467.24 --> 2470.76]  after post-processing on video editing and stuff like that.
[2471.32 --> 2472.38]  What does Linus mean?
[2472.38 --> 2477.62]  It means golden or flaxen-haired, which, as you can see, has nothing necessarily to do
[2477.62 --> 2480.08]  with the effect of naming your children Linus.
[2481.36 --> 2481.90]  Oh, okay.
[2481.94 --> 2482.84]  People agree with you.
[2484.10 --> 2484.50]  Oh, yeah.
[2484.58 --> 2487.48]  You were fired today for calling a hockey period halftime.
[2487.72 --> 2489.22]  So that's three so far today.
[2489.68 --> 2492.12]  He called the hockey break halftime.
[2492.32 --> 2492.76]  Okay.
[2493.04 --> 2494.22]  What kind of Canadian are you?
[2494.32 --> 2498.26]  Not only am I horribly sick and not fully at it today, usually the second intermission
[2498.26 --> 2499.74]  is referred to as a halftime.
[2500.28 --> 2501.78]  Did you just call it an intermission?
[2503.74 --> 2504.96]  Oh, okay.
[2505.14 --> 2505.64]  Okay, here.
[2505.78 --> 2506.90]  Let me explain to you something.
[2507.68 --> 2507.84]  Okay.
[2508.32 --> 2509.68]  Hockey has three periods.
[2509.88 --> 2510.06]  Yeah.
[2510.56 --> 2512.40]  No intermission is half.
[2513.50 --> 2513.98]  Okay.
[2514.88 --> 2516.34]  None of them are called halftime.
[2516.48 --> 2517.92]  No, I said referenced as.
[2518.58 --> 2519.00]  No.
[2519.22 --> 2520.92]  Yeah, the second one is often referenced as.
[2520.92 --> 2521.30]  No.
[2521.58 --> 2521.98]  Yeah, it is.
[2521.98 --> 2523.22]  It's only called halftime.
[2523.22 --> 2524.66]  Okay, they're going to rip you apart.
[2524.84 --> 2527.54]  Because it's only called halftime in NBA and NFL.
[2527.78 --> 2528.06]  I know.
[2528.06 --> 2529.42]  Because they have four quarters.
[2529.44 --> 2529.86]  I know.
[2529.96 --> 2530.64]  I played sports.
[2530.76 --> 2531.36]  I played hockey.
[2531.50 --> 2535.24]  Okay, anyone you know who ever called the second period of a hockey game halftime is
[2535.24 --> 2535.68]  a retard.
[2535.98 --> 2538.00]  It's just so you can discern between them easily.
[2538.14 --> 2538.68]  No, it isn't.
[2538.88 --> 2540.64]  It's called the first and second intermission.
[2540.82 --> 2541.12]  Okay.
[2542.92 --> 2543.96]  Settle down, big man.
[2547.34 --> 2548.50]  I'll play you in hockey.
[2548.74 --> 2549.26]  Do it.
[2549.32 --> 2550.08]  I will win.
[2550.42 --> 2551.54]  Actually, I don't want to do that.
[2551.54 --> 2552.90]  I will destroy you.
[2553.28 --> 2553.50]  No.
[2554.80 --> 2556.94]  I'm planning on getting a 3570K.
[2556.94 --> 2558.06]  Is the H100i worth it?
[2558.06 --> 2561.44]  A different cooler will be just fine if you're only planning to go to 4.2.
[2561.80 --> 2565.74]  However, I would go as far as to say that if you're going to 4.2, the overclocking bug
[2565.74 --> 2566.82]  will probably bite you.
[2566.96 --> 2569.78]  So get something better and push it.
[2570.30 --> 2571.58]  Why stop at 4.2?
[2572.38 --> 2573.34]  Low RPM fans rule.
[2573.46 --> 2573.72]  Bam.
[2573.86 --> 2574.54]  Noise blockers.
[2575.24 --> 2576.22]  700 RPM.
[2576.40 --> 2576.78]  Inaudible.
[2576.78 --> 2577.26]  Yes.
[2577.42 --> 2578.70]  And he makes a good point.
[2579.02 --> 2584.58]  I would say you're way better off with 10 low RPM fans than one high RPM fan.
[2585.46 --> 2585.84]  Yeah.
[2585.90 --> 2587.48]  But the same argument as before.
[2587.66 --> 2589.22]  I don't mind the droning noise.
[2589.52 --> 2589.96]  So it doesn't really...
[2589.96 --> 2594.14]  I mean, that's why for those of you who are following my personal rig, even though I'm
[2594.14 --> 2599.70]  a silence freak, I have two 120s in the top, two 92s in the back, so that's 4 so far.
[2599.96 --> 2607.96]  I have another 4 on my radiator at the bottom, another 2 on my radiator at the top, and...
[2607.96 --> 2612.14]  Did I cover the radiator at the front already?
[2612.56 --> 2613.50]  Yeah, I think I did.
[2613.98 --> 2615.96]  So 6 plus 4...
[2616.60 --> 2617.44]  I don't know, like 10?
[2617.58 --> 2618.38]  Why did I say 11?
[2618.82 --> 2619.32]  I don't know, whatever.
[2619.42 --> 2620.04]  A lot of fans.
[2620.26 --> 2624.98]  But I have them controlled with my M3T balancer, so most of them are off a lot of the time.
[2625.30 --> 2630.14]  And then the ones that are on are running at an extremely low RPM, so I can honestly barely
[2630.14 --> 2630.80]  hear my system.
[2631.82 --> 2632.80]  Minus pimp tips.
[2633.10 --> 2637.66]  I have 8 fans in my case and 3 graphics cards, but I don't care, because Battlefield 3 drowns
[2637.66 --> 2637.98]  them out.
[2638.76 --> 2640.56]  Alright, play your precious Battlefield 3.
[2640.96 --> 2642.76]  I like the sound of fans, I can't stand it.
[2644.88 --> 2647.86]  Yeah, Slick, maybe if you put on a jacket you wouldn't get sick.
[2648.36 --> 2649.38]  I'll let you field that one.
[2649.70 --> 2652.20]  That has literally nothing to do with me being sick.
[2655.02 --> 2655.90]  Oh my goodness.
[2656.42 --> 2658.08]  I'm just going to skim over that anyways.
[2658.70 --> 2659.26]  But look it up.
[2659.26 --> 2661.02]  Nope, nope, new big topic.
[2662.46 --> 2664.26]  Instagram owns your photos.
[2665.08 --> 2665.48]  Didn't they?
[2665.56 --> 2666.38]  No, they revoked that.
[2666.68 --> 2666.94]  When?
[2666.94 --> 2668.84]  Like, a couple days ago.
[2668.86 --> 2669.18]  Yesterday?
[2669.88 --> 2671.10]  No, I think it was a few days ago.
[2671.34 --> 2671.66]  Oh.
[2671.96 --> 2676.04]  I don't know the whole story, but they announced the big thing, everyone freaked out, and they
[2676.04 --> 2677.28]  bounced back and forth for a little bit.
[2677.58 --> 2678.84]  I don't know exactly where they are now.
[2678.90 --> 2679.48]  Okay, I don't know.
[2679.52 --> 2679.90]  Let me see.
[2679.94 --> 2680.98]  When did I send that to myself?
[2681.78 --> 2682.82]  That's from three days ago.
[2682.98 --> 2683.66]  So it must have been...
[2683.66 --> 2684.32]  Okay, you know what?
[2684.38 --> 2687.18]  Maybe you guys tweeted us and let us know if it's been retracted.
[2687.18 --> 2687.84]  I could be wrong.
[2687.84 --> 2690.90]  I know they bounced around a little bit after it was originally announced.
[2691.04 --> 2692.78]  Let's pretend for now that it hasn't happened.
[2693.06 --> 2695.40]  That it has happened and they haven't retracted it.
[2695.40 --> 2697.42]  That is the craziest thing ever.
[2698.24 --> 2701.06]  Because basically, their assumption...
[2701.06 --> 2703.16]  Like, they're operating like almost like a...
[2703.16 --> 2705.68]  Like, it's almost a piracy issue at that point.
[2706.00 --> 2717.24]  Because they're operating like a torrent site that was monetizing the movies that they're letting people download.
[2717.24 --> 2718.56]  Like, that's what they're doing.
[2718.62 --> 2720.20]  They're acting as like a...
[2720.20 --> 2722.26]  Except that they're hosting the content too.
[2722.56 --> 2723.76]  So it's like even worse.
[2723.84 --> 2725.78]  But in the agreement, you're giving it to them, aren't you?
[2726.04 --> 2728.02]  You're giving it to them, but it might not be yours.
[2729.74 --> 2730.18]  Right.
[2730.34 --> 2731.92]  Because you could upload whatever there.
[2732.20 --> 2732.64]  Right.
[2732.90 --> 2733.46]  That's interesting.
[2733.46 --> 2742.82]  They would be monetizing and asking for the right to sell something that potentially you don't even own to give them.
[2742.96 --> 2749.16]  Which would either be a liability for them or would actually be a personal liability for whoever uploaded it.
[2749.30 --> 2752.50]  I'm sure they'd find some way to make it a personal liability for the uploader.
[2752.74 --> 2755.74]  And like, photos taken of people within houses and stuff.
[2755.96 --> 2756.14]  Yeah.
[2756.20 --> 2757.14]  You're not allowed to just publish that.
[2757.14 --> 2757.94]  You're not allowed to do that.
[2757.94 --> 2759.74]  You can do it if you're in a public area.
[2760.04 --> 2760.14]  Yes.
[2760.14 --> 2763.26]  But not if you're just randomly in a house or in some type of private area.
[2763.26 --> 2765.02]  And so whose liability is that now?
[2765.18 --> 2766.34]  If you take a picture of someone...
[2766.34 --> 2768.50]  And it's not even just private area like a house.
[2768.90 --> 2770.48]  Like, private area like a library.
[2770.68 --> 2770.98]  Oh, yeah.
[2771.12 --> 2773.26]  Like, not public land.
[2773.52 --> 2776.92]  Like, holy crap.
[2777.30 --> 2777.82]  I was just...
[2777.82 --> 2778.82]  I was looking at that.
[2778.88 --> 2779.52]  I was like, really?
[2780.40 --> 2781.68]  That's just insane.
[2782.34 --> 2785.70]  And it's generated so much bad publicity for Facebook.
[2785.70 --> 2786.56]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[2786.56 --> 2791.84]  Because it just gets people talking about, well, here's all the other, you know, bullcrap things that Facebook's done.
[2792.06 --> 2794.90]  And it just gets that, like, negative buzz.
[2794.96 --> 2796.16]  I mean, will Facebook exist...
[2796.16 --> 2797.32]  Here, here's a discussion topic.
[2797.42 --> 2798.80]  Will Facebook exist in five years?
[2799.10 --> 2800.46]  I find this very interesting.
[2800.58 --> 2801.20]  I have no idea.
[2801.34 --> 2807.76]  I see it like Facebook in everyone's lives as far as I knew used to be so much bigger.
[2808.92 --> 2811.30]  Like, a year, two years ago-ish.
[2811.48 --> 2812.64]  Like, a year and a half, two years ago.
[2812.68 --> 2813.88]  It used to be huge.
[2813.88 --> 2816.34]  And now I see a lot more people going away from it.
[2816.60 --> 2817.76]  What are they going to, though?
[2818.14 --> 2819.38]  Because Google Plus sucks.
[2819.58 --> 2820.12]  Just nothing.
[2820.44 --> 2822.58]  Back to calling and text messages.
[2824.24 --> 2831.24]  Because I think a lot of people are getting on there, getting, like, a thousand friends, and then going, holy crap, I don't know most of these people or care about them.
[2831.70 --> 2833.26]  It's offensive when you delete them.
[2833.26 --> 2836.94]  It just gets kind of, like, this awkward kind of space.
[2837.48 --> 2839.44]  And then you start creeping other people's profiles.
[2839.68 --> 2840.96]  Other people start creeping your profile.
[2841.10 --> 2844.72]  And you're just like, I don't want this to be the way that I figure out who people are.
[2844.92 --> 2847.32]  And I don't want this to be the way that people figure out who I am.
[2847.40 --> 2849.90]  On the other hand, it can be extremely convenient for certain things.
[2849.90 --> 2850.54]  At the same time.
[2850.60 --> 2850.76]  Yeah.
[2850.76 --> 2856.06]  So it's got a lot of pluses and minuses, but I think it's not just like the golden holy grail that it used to be.
[2856.50 --> 2859.44]  I think a lot of people are seeing that they don't necessarily need or want it all the time.
[2859.52 --> 2860.44]  My mom's a teacher.
[2860.44 --> 2871.40]  And her whole thing is that the perception of Facebook is changing to, like, that's something my mom and dad and grandma and grandpa use to get in touch with me.
[2871.46 --> 2874.90]  See, that's more interesting because she's more in tuned with the kids.
[2875.22 --> 2875.48]  Yes.
[2876.26 --> 2880.22]  So that is, to me, I'm looking at that going, okay, well, that's sort of where it's trending.
[2880.22 --> 2891.80]  On the other hand, if older people are using it, then Facebook has managed to be that magical, like, accessible to everyone pervasive thing.
[2892.20 --> 2893.60]  So that's like, yay.
[2893.76 --> 2896.36]  But then the young people moving away from it is like, boom.
[2896.64 --> 2897.06]  And then.
[2897.84 --> 2898.66]  What are they using?
[2898.94 --> 2900.54]  Just like I said, text messages to phone calls?
[2900.66 --> 2902.40]  They text incessantly.
[2902.66 --> 2902.80]  Yeah.
[2904.20 --> 2908.04]  But, I mean, Facebook's great for that, too, because you can message on Facebook.
[2908.04 --> 2911.52]  And I like the integration between private messages and chat.
[2912.22 --> 2914.44]  Personally, I do appreciate it.
[2915.18 --> 2919.94]  But I don't know if it exists in five years.
[2920.02 --> 2921.20]  I don't know in what form.
[2922.74 --> 2927.34]  Because I just have no use for it.
[2928.26 --> 2929.36]  I think it will be there.
[2929.46 --> 2931.22]  I don't think it will do the MySpace dump.
[2931.70 --> 2934.70]  Because they'll have those consistent people.
[2934.70 --> 2939.28]  Like the groups that they have their whole family on there, and that's how their family communicates.
[2939.70 --> 2942.02]  Like, there's a lot of people that are like that.
[2942.38 --> 2944.48]  So I don't think they'll necessarily disappear.
[2944.72 --> 2946.52]  I think it will just be a completely different form.
[2948.72 --> 2950.32]  And then again, it could be the same thing.
[2950.46 --> 2950.74]  I don't know.
[2951.56 --> 2952.42]  I don't remember.
[2954.56 --> 2955.42]  Okay, so at the top.
[2955.42 --> 2957.20]  You tweeted about a gaming giveaway a few days ago?
[2957.34 --> 2957.54]  Later.
[2958.04 --> 2958.74]  It'll come later.
[2959.62 --> 2961.00]  Tuning in at 5 a.m. in Wales.
[2961.22 --> 2961.58]  Yes!
[2961.98 --> 2962.26]  Yeah.
[2962.26 --> 2964.22]  Oh, he's in a hospital bed, though.
[2964.40 --> 2964.70]  Boo.
[2964.90 --> 2965.48]  That's no good.
[2965.58 --> 2966.46]  Sorry to hear that, man.
[2968.06 --> 2970.26]  I only use Facebook to communicate with extended family.
[2970.38 --> 2971.46]  For other purposes, I hate it.
[2971.56 --> 2971.72]  Yeah.
[2971.90 --> 2972.68]  And then anyone who...
[2972.68 --> 2973.08]  Oh, sorry.
[2973.14 --> 2973.88]  We're not showing the tweets.
[2974.48 --> 2981.22]  For anyone who doesn't want to communicate with their extended family, then it's like...
[2981.22 --> 2981.82]  Yeah, whatevs.
[2981.82 --> 2983.10]  I mean, I've always been...
[2983.10 --> 2985.86]  Actually, I mean, I'm tech-savvy in some ways.
[2985.94 --> 2987.52]  But in other ways, I'm very resistant.
[2987.52 --> 2989.04]  Like, I never had a MySpace account.
[2989.58 --> 2992.52]  Never had, like, a Zanga account or...
[2993.52 --> 2994.70]  You know...
[2994.70 --> 2995.90]  I was on the palace.
[2996.38 --> 2997.34]  So that was a long time ago.
[2997.62 --> 3001.32]  I'd love it if anyone who also used the palace tweets because...
[3001.32 --> 3002.28]  I've never even heard of this.
[3002.32 --> 3004.00]  This is before your time, son.
[3004.90 --> 3006.08]  So I was on the palace.
[3006.38 --> 3008.26]  It was basically like a chat room.
[3008.62 --> 3010.36]  And, like, every chat room was just like a...
[3010.36 --> 3011.82]  Like, it was just an image.
[3012.48 --> 3014.36]  And then people's avatars.
[3014.36 --> 3017.14]  You could just kind of move around the room and then there was just little speech bubbles.
[3017.56 --> 3019.70]  The palace is the only reason I learned to touch type.
[3020.48 --> 3022.94]  Because there was no log of messages.
[3023.40 --> 3025.20]  You had to just be looking at the screen and reading.
[3025.60 --> 3027.20]  So if you wanted to say anything...
[3027.20 --> 3027.38]  Yeah.
[3027.62 --> 3028.30]  You had to be quick.
[3028.42 --> 3029.36]  You had to be a touch typist.
[3029.42 --> 3030.16]  You had to be fast.
[3030.36 --> 3031.56]  It's the only reason I know how to type.
[3031.80 --> 3032.22]  That's funny.
[3032.58 --> 3033.62]  So I was on that.
[3033.82 --> 3034.94]  And then I didn't do any...
[3034.94 --> 3036.44]  I used MSN Messenger a lot.
[3037.20 --> 3040.82]  And then I didn't get anything until I finally gave in and got Facebook.
[3040.82 --> 3046.32]  I went from Nexopia, which I very rarely used.
[3046.64 --> 3047.06]  No, I know.
[3047.14 --> 3049.88]  You're fired for having a Nexopia account at some point.
[3049.98 --> 3051.20]  I never had MySpace.
[3051.52 --> 3056.06]  And then I didn't get Facebook until I was in, like, grade nine.
[3056.34 --> 3058.06]  And then I didn't even make my Facebook.
[3058.40 --> 3061.22]  One of my friends made my Facebook and attached it to my email.
[3061.38 --> 3061.52]  Right.
[3061.52 --> 3062.52]  And it was like, log in.
[3062.58 --> 3064.90]  But I think that's how a lot of people got sucked into it.
[3065.84 --> 3066.86]  Yeah, to be honest.
[3067.02 --> 3068.20]  And then I used it for a while.
[3068.20 --> 3071.70]  I mean, the only reason I ever use it is if I get a private...
[3071.70 --> 3074.32]  Like, I only accept real-life acquaintances.
[3074.60 --> 3077.02]  And then if I get a private message, then I'll look at that.
[3077.08 --> 3077.90]  But I don't look at my wall.
[3077.94 --> 3079.46]  I mean, I use Facebook for the fan page.
[3079.74 --> 3080.00]  Right.
[3080.18 --> 3081.30]  Like, I monitor that.
[3081.30 --> 3082.40]  But then you use that.
[3082.50 --> 3082.64]  Yeah.
[3082.74 --> 3087.60]  Like, my personal Facebook, I only use for, like, my little group of gaming friends.
[3087.72 --> 3088.62]  And then school.
[3089.36 --> 3089.90]  That's it.
[3090.44 --> 3091.26]  So, I don't know.
[3091.58 --> 3094.54]  There are some white incinerating lights crawling over Earth.
[3094.62 --> 3094.98]  What do?
[3095.64 --> 3097.06]  Run away from the light.
[3097.06 --> 3098.18]  Don't move towards the light.
[3098.92 --> 3099.14]  Should it...
[3099.14 --> 3099.36]  Nope.
[3099.48 --> 3102.08]  You should not demagnetize your screwdriver before mounting a motherboard.
[3102.46 --> 3104.00]  Thoughts on Alienware laptops?
[3104.30 --> 3105.06]  They're bulky.
[3106.24 --> 3108.32]  And they're not powerful compared to a desktop.
[3108.72 --> 3109.30]  But they're portable.
[3109.78 --> 3110.94]  Which sounds like you already knew.
[3111.20 --> 3112.26]  They heat up a lot, usually.
[3112.30 --> 3112.46]  Yeah.
[3112.52 --> 3113.28]  And they run hot.
[3114.66 --> 3114.94]  Ah!
[3114.98 --> 3118.52]  They went back to their previous policy agreement and added an extra filter to say,
[3118.62 --> 3120.32]  sorry for making you mad.
[3121.58 --> 3122.02]  Okay.
[3122.36 --> 3122.70]  Okay.
[3122.94 --> 3123.40]  There you go.
[3123.48 --> 3124.26]  Apparently it was yesterday.
[3124.26 --> 3125.22]  Yeah.
[3125.34 --> 3126.66]  They won't sell your photos.
[3127.20 --> 3128.68]  You're using your photos for advertising.
[3128.82 --> 3129.36]  You still own them.
[3129.46 --> 3129.68]  Okay.
[3129.90 --> 3130.16]  Good.
[3131.84 --> 3135.58]  From Facebook to potentially Google Plus or whatever that is.
[3136.06 --> 3136.50]  Diaspora.
[3136.66 --> 3137.52]  What's diaspora?
[3137.70 --> 3138.20]  No idea.
[3138.32 --> 3138.52]  Okay.
[3138.56 --> 3138.76]  Cool.
[3139.12 --> 3139.90]  We're just texting.
[3140.12 --> 3140.72]  Facebook sucks.
[3140.80 --> 3141.46]  I hope it dies.
[3141.60 --> 3142.06]  Stab, stab.
[3142.24 --> 3143.98]  What do you think of the new Twitch layout beta?
[3144.10 --> 3144.80]  Haven't seen it.
[3145.02 --> 3145.64]  It's good.
[3145.88 --> 3146.24]  Is it?
[3146.38 --> 3147.80]  We were supposed to use it for this stream.
[3147.86 --> 3148.64]  I forgot to tell you.
[3148.64 --> 3149.42]  Oh.
[3150.26 --> 3153.24]  I think it's just Twitch slash new.
[3154.14 --> 3154.50]  Okay.
[3154.86 --> 3158.72]  But I don't know if they have to set it to that or if we set it to that.
[3158.72 --> 3159.22]  Let's look at it.
[3159.28 --> 3160.34]  Let's see how much we like it.
[3160.42 --> 3162.92]  So we just go to our URL and then slash new.
[3163.06 --> 3164.04]  I'm pretty sure is what it is.
[3164.04 --> 3164.16]  Okay.
[3164.16 --> 3166.06]  Let's make this green here for a sec.
[3166.06 --> 3168.22]  All right.
[3168.38 --> 3171.90]  So there's, you got the chat on the side, which looks pretty normal.
[3172.32 --> 3175.14]  And then you've got like a bunch of other cool stuff on the left.
[3175.30 --> 3175.70]  It's just.
[3176.00 --> 3176.60]  It looks cleaner.
[3176.78 --> 3177.60]  Better usage of space.
[3177.68 --> 3178.16]  Yeah, it's cleaner.
[3178.30 --> 3179.22]  Yeah, it looks a lot cleaner.
[3179.48 --> 3179.66]  Yeah.
[3180.00 --> 3180.62]  It's nice.
[3180.70 --> 3182.78]  Is the size of the player, was it adjustable before?
[3183.54 --> 3186.38]  I don't know, but I think the default size is also larger now.
[3186.54 --> 3186.84]  Cool.
[3187.26 --> 3187.88]  Well, that's great.
[3187.88 --> 3191.72]  I mean, if we're going to stream in 1080p, you might as well be able to, you might as well
[3191.72 --> 3193.38]  be able to actually like see it.
[3193.68 --> 3193.78]  Right.
[3193.90 --> 3195.84]  But I don't know if we set it to that on our end.
[3195.84 --> 3196.90]  I don't think we set it to that.
[3196.94 --> 3198.32]  Well, he's watching us right now.
[3198.48 --> 3198.66]  Yeah.
[3198.74 --> 3199.90]  So the viewer sets it to that.
[3199.98 --> 3204.88]  So if you guys go to your URL bar and type slash new at the end, you'll get the much better
[3204.88 --> 3205.02]  later.
[3205.04 --> 3206.22]  How many viewers do we have tonight?
[3206.48 --> 3206.84]  Oh, wow.
[3206.90 --> 3207.26]  2,100.
[3208.36 --> 3210.14]  Apparently, we don't suck as bad as last week.
[3210.22 --> 3212.00]  Actually, I think last week just people were in finals.
[3212.12 --> 3212.44]  Finals.
[3212.70 --> 3212.88]  Yeah.
[3212.96 --> 3214.38]  And we forgive you, you guys.
[3214.38 --> 3217.98]  We know school is like awesome.
[3218.72 --> 3218.98]  Yeah.
[3221.34 --> 3223.00]  I don't think they even saw our fist bump.
[3223.50 --> 3224.74]  Recreate the fist bump moment.
[3224.74 --> 3225.78]  That hurts.
[3225.88 --> 3226.92]  Your knuckles are so big.
[3227.16 --> 3227.32]  Sorry.
[3227.82 --> 3230.20]  I swear, your knuckles are like twice the size of mine.
[3231.42 --> 3233.04]  It doesn't correlate to anything else.
[3235.22 --> 3236.64]  Greetings from Costa Rica.
[3236.84 --> 3237.70]  Are you still at the office?
[3238.24 --> 3239.38]  Absolutely not.
[3239.80 --> 3240.94]  We are in my garage.
[3240.94 --> 3242.24]  There's an axe on the wall.
[3242.24 --> 3242.48]  Yeah.
[3243.70 --> 3246.90]  The Russian has had a paintball gun at work for like two months.
[3247.12 --> 3247.52]  What?
[3249.98 --> 3251.10]  How is that allowed?
[3251.22 --> 3253.42]  I gave him hell for it earlier this week.
[3253.50 --> 3255.30]  I was like, why is this still here?
[3255.72 --> 3258.74]  Because I think he brought it in as like a Halloween costume or something.
[3258.74 --> 3263.68]  But like early in October and we're like mid-October and we're at like the end of December.
[3263.68 --> 3267.50]  I'm just like, you didn't even end up dressing up in this as a costume.
[3267.88 --> 3268.88]  Take this thing home.
[3269.08 --> 3271.24]  It's bad enough he has a sword in his office.
[3271.44 --> 3271.64]  Yeah.
[3271.78 --> 3272.40]  I saw that too.
[3272.44 --> 3274.50]  But that was, that's NZXT swag though.
[3274.58 --> 3274.80]  Yeah.
[3274.80 --> 3280.68]  That was, that went with the, the sword was part of the same thing that I allowed me
[3280.68 --> 3282.56]  to acquire that helmet right there.
[3282.94 --> 3286.44]  So, I mean the sword I kind of understand because at least it's tech swag.
[3286.84 --> 3291.22]  But like this paintball gun and it's like, it's like a replica style paintball gun.
[3291.30 --> 3294.96]  Like it doesn't just look like, it's not like a spider or something like a goofy little
[3294.96 --> 3295.28]  marker.
[3295.44 --> 3300.32]  Like it's got a stock on it and like, I'm just like, dude, don't do that.
[3300.70 --> 3302.32]  It's like an office.
[3302.32 --> 3306.86]  Like, you know, with all the things that go on in like offices and schools, it's like
[3306.86 --> 3308.16]  people don't want to see that, man.
[3309.70 --> 3312.64]  Oh, speaking of the Russian, did he ever text me tonight?
[3312.72 --> 3316.30]  He was going to tell me they're doing some kind of like game until the world ends event
[3316.30 --> 3317.10]  or something tonight.
[3318.18 --> 3323.28]  I don't know when it runs until, but you, I don't know, go to the, I don't even know
[3323.28 --> 3323.70]  where to go.
[3324.46 --> 3326.30]  There might be a post on the forum or something.
[3326.82 --> 3327.46]  That'd be my guess.
[3328.22 --> 3328.76]  I don't know.
[3328.82 --> 3329.80]  He was like, can you join?
[3329.86 --> 3331.42]  And I'm like, I got my live stream.
[3331.42 --> 3335.60]  And yeah, and I don't have a gaming rig yet, but soon.
[3335.86 --> 3336.26]  Shut up.
[3336.46 --> 3336.84]  Noob.
[3338.24 --> 3340.54]  Did I miss the talk about the Intel NVIDIA thing?
[3340.68 --> 3341.78]  Yes, you did.
[3342.50 --> 3342.90]  But it's okay.
[3343.28 --> 3343.84]  Lightstream archive.
[3343.98 --> 3344.70]  Archive, archive.
[3346.60 --> 3349.24]  What do you, the new 7 series card's going to be like?
[3349.96 --> 3354.08]  I am expecting, I'm expecting like a 480 to 580 bump.
[3354.40 --> 3356.74]  I'm expecting them to be more efficient and a little bit more powerful.
[3358.56 --> 3359.68]  Yeah, I don't.
[3359.68 --> 3360.42]  No guarantees though.
[3361.48 --> 3366.54]  I mean, they might pull, you know, GK110 out of their butts and be like, yeah, whatever.
[3367.34 --> 3368.10]  So, I don't know.
[3368.36 --> 3368.74]  I doubt it.
[3368.94 --> 3369.76]  I don't see that happening.
[3369.90 --> 3370.38]  I don't see that happening.
[3370.38 --> 3370.78]  You never know.
[3371.08 --> 3374.66]  Because if they can sell enough of them for supercomputing, then I'm sure they're fine.
[3375.42 --> 3377.32]  Ah, what do you think of OCZ and the new vector SSD?
[3377.48 --> 3378.98]  Actually, Slick, you benchmarked it today.
[3379.24 --> 3379.64]  How'd it go?
[3379.64 --> 3382.28]  I didn't go way too into data on it.
[3382.54 --> 3383.16]  Oh, you just...
[3383.16 --> 3384.24]  I wasn't done benchmarking.
[3384.30 --> 3384.96]  Oh, okay.
[3385.06 --> 3386.50]  I got like halfway through.
[3386.50 --> 3390.28]  I can tell you from what I've read and from what I've seen, so far it looks reliable.
[3390.78 --> 3392.28]  And the performance is beast.
[3392.92 --> 3398.80]  So, I think I understand a lot of what OCZ was doing with the branding of the vector and
[3398.80 --> 3399.82]  with the way they did the release.
[3399.90 --> 3404.06]  So, number one is they moved away from any of their previous branding conventions.
[3404.06 --> 3410.52]  So, Vertex, the reason they stuck with Vertex for four generations was that Vertex had such
[3410.52 --> 3412.06]  a strong brand.
[3412.58 --> 3417.44]  Like, back in the Agility 1, Vertex 1 days, the performance difference between those drives
[3417.44 --> 3418.50]  was very small.
[3419.10 --> 3423.08]  I mean, we were limited by things that went beyond using sync or async flash.
[3424.02 --> 3426.90]  Controllers, interface, all that stuff.
[3427.88 --> 3433.14]  But, because the Vertex branding was so strong and there were so many reviews and the customer
[3433.14 --> 3436.96]  perception was so good of a Vertex, it outsold Agility.
[3437.08 --> 3441.08]  At least, I'm just speaking from my experience as the OCZ product manager at NCIX.
[3441.48 --> 3443.92]  It outsold Agility like 10, 20 to 1.
[3444.28 --> 3445.34]  Like, huge.
[3445.80 --> 3447.80]  And Vertex 2, I had the same experience.
[3447.90 --> 3449.58]  Vertex 3, same experience.
[3449.74 --> 3454.52]  Agility started to catch up a lot because async flash got really cheaper at times.
[3455.90 --> 3457.44]  Vertex 4, same thing.
[3457.52 --> 3460.90]  But Agility 4 was a legitimately much worse drive than Vertex 4.
[3461.34 --> 3462.96]  So, they went and they changed.
[3462.96 --> 3466.12]  Like, how often do companies do stuff like that?
[3466.28 --> 3469.58]  Like, when did it, like, Intel is still using the Pentium name.
[3469.78 --> 3469.98]  Yeah.
[3470.14 --> 3473.38]  I would say AMD should still be using the Athlon name.
[3473.64 --> 3474.64]  Yeah, like, you know.
[3474.72 --> 3475.34]  Why not?
[3475.56 --> 3477.76]  Like, you have a good branding asset, you use it.
[3477.80 --> 3478.18]  Why not?
[3478.42 --> 3480.08]  As long as you have a good product to go with it.
[3480.32 --> 3482.70]  So, Vector, they're saying, look, we're a new company.
[3483.12 --> 3484.14]  We're doing things differently.
[3484.80 --> 3487.50]  You know, so they're doing long warranty, which they did on Vertex 4.
[3487.50 --> 3489.08]  So, they're continuing that.
[3489.38 --> 3492.68]  They did a much more rigorous testing of the drive.
[3492.78 --> 3495.18]  They validated it in a way that they haven't done in the past.
[3495.36 --> 3497.68]  How long did it take them to bring this one to market?
[3497.92 --> 3498.36]  18 months.
[3498.52 --> 3500.14]  Compared to Vertex?
[3500.36 --> 3501.44]  Less than 12 months.
[3501.56 --> 3501.76]  Yeah.
[3502.00 --> 3502.78]  For previous drives.
[3502.78 --> 3507.80]  Which means they spent at least six months just validating it.
[3507.80 --> 3510.14]  At least half a year more on just the development.
[3510.60 --> 3511.16]  Validating it.
[3511.16 --> 3511.30]  Yeah.
[3511.52 --> 3514.98]  So, I think that they were trying to say, look, we're a new OCZ.
[3515.18 --> 3516.06]  And they really are.
[3516.06 --> 3519.16]  Like, they're people that I've known there.
[3519.72 --> 3526.56]  Like, the CEO, the Chief Sales Officer, or Director of Sales, or I forget, VP of Sales?
[3526.82 --> 3528.56]  I think VP of Sales was his actual title.
[3528.56 --> 3531.10]  So, but like, these guys, they're gone.
[3532.06 --> 3534.98]  And it's a very, very different crew over there.
[3535.00 --> 3535.98]  I can tell you guys that much.
[3536.10 --> 3537.30]  So, yeah.
[3537.78 --> 3538.96]  Very, very positive.
[3539.18 --> 3541.32]  I have a really good feeling about where they're going.
[3541.42 --> 3545.50]  I mean, they've still got some stuff to get figured out on the financial side, on the legal side.
[3546.30 --> 3547.50]  You know, they're a public company.
[3547.64 --> 3549.82]  So, there's a lot of paperwork that goes along with that.
[3549.94 --> 3550.78]  And they've got to figure that out.
[3550.78 --> 3553.82]  But, you know, I hope they land on their feet.
[3554.12 --> 3554.58]  Yeah, me too.
[3554.94 --> 3556.54]  They've been around for a while.
[3556.62 --> 3557.32]  So, it'd be nice to keep them around.
[3557.32 --> 3559.70]  Yeah, I'm, like I said, I'm like halfway done the benchmarks.
[3559.92 --> 3562.50]  So, next, whenever, we'll film it.
[3562.62 --> 3564.16]  And then we'll release it as soon as possible.
[3564.30 --> 3566.30]  I mean, they've done some things wrong over the years.
[3566.72 --> 3568.22]  But, quite frankly, so has everyone.
[3568.74 --> 3569.00]  Yeah.
[3569.34 --> 3570.92]  You know, you look at...
[3571.50 --> 3576.08]  Intel screwed up the firmware on X25 twice.
[3577.04 --> 3577.92]  Do you know about this?
[3577.92 --> 3579.66]  It wasn't into SSDs then, because they were...
[3579.66 --> 3579.96]  Okay.
[3580.50 --> 3584.80]  Crucial screwed up the M4, so it just turned off after a certain number of hours.
[3584.80 --> 3585.06]  Yeah.
[3585.26 --> 3587.52]  You know, you look at things like RAM.
[3588.04 --> 3592.18]  Crucial had a disastrous batch of ballistics back in the DDR2 days.
[3592.28 --> 3594.02]  We were talking like 40% RMA rates.
[3594.02 --> 3594.58]  That I remember.
[3594.90 --> 3597.20]  Bad batches happen to everyone.
[3597.64 --> 3598.50]  Stuff happens.
[3598.92 --> 3601.26]  And OCZ gets a really bad rap sometimes.
[3601.52 --> 3603.08]  Well, because they sell a lot.
[3603.38 --> 3604.02]  They sell a lot.
[3604.06 --> 3605.52]  But I'm talking even other categories.
[3606.06 --> 3609.52]  OCZ power supplies, for whatever reason, have this terrible reputation.
[3609.78 --> 3610.42]  Like on forums.
[3610.42 --> 3612.94]  You look at experienced guys going, oh, I wouldn't touch that.
[3613.56 --> 3614.50]  Let me tell you something.
[3614.58 --> 3618.18]  And I don't normally talk about this kind of stuff, because it's kind of confidential information.
[3618.52 --> 3624.36]  But, the RMA rate back to NCIX on OCZ power supplies was around 2%.
[3624.36 --> 3630.86]  Which, I can tell you guys right now, was number 2 in terms of RMA rates at NCIX.
[3630.86 --> 3634.96]  And we're talking Antec, Seasonic, Corsair.
[3635.40 --> 3638.00]  Two of those three were worse than OCZ.
[3639.18 --> 3641.46]  For the period of time that I was managing it.
[3641.56 --> 3641.74]  Right.
[3642.02 --> 3643.22]  Which was like 3 years.
[3644.12 --> 3645.34]  So, bam.
[3645.34 --> 3652.00]  Like, people sort of talk about it, but it's like, where are they getting this data?
[3653.24 --> 3655.16]  Like, maybe they got bitten by something.
[3655.24 --> 3657.24]  I still have a Game Extreme 600 watt.
[3658.12 --> 3659.64]  And, like, that's a launch unit.
[3659.86 --> 3660.12]  Yeah.
[3660.28 --> 3663.34]  That's running in my work machine at NCIX.
[3663.78 --> 3666.22]  So, this is like, what, 5, 6 years down the road?
[3666.50 --> 3668.68]  It's not like every one of them dies.
[3668.76 --> 3669.94]  And it seems to be the perception.
[3670.04 --> 3670.56]  I don't understand.
[3670.56 --> 3675.20]  And you look at recent products like ZX series, built by a very reputable OEM.
[3675.56 --> 3677.08]  Very high quality power supply.
[3678.26 --> 3678.78]  I don't get it.
[3680.54 --> 3681.52]  Anyway, OCZ.
[3684.56 --> 3685.08]  Um.
[3686.44 --> 3687.80]  Were you ever on GeoCities?
[3687.96 --> 3688.20]  Nope.
[3690.54 --> 3691.42]  Watching from Ecuador.
[3691.72 --> 3692.18]  Yes!
[3692.52 --> 3694.54]  Streaming in 360p like a boss.
[3695.76 --> 3698.58]  Thank you for tolerating our terrible 360p-ness.
[3699.74 --> 3699.96]  No.
[3700.56 --> 3702.50]  No.
[3702.98 --> 3703.82]  Come on!
[3704.20 --> 3704.46]  No.
[3705.10 --> 3707.98]  Ness is a perfectly legitimate suffix.
[3709.58 --> 3710.86]  360p is a real thing.
[3711.12 --> 3711.64]  Okay.
[3713.62 --> 3714.22]  No.
[3714.74 --> 3715.22]  No.
[3715.88 --> 3717.24]  No for that.
[3717.40 --> 3717.92]  Whatever, man.
[3721.16 --> 3721.72]  Okay.
[3723.18 --> 3726.66]  I don't expect Intel and Apple to team up at any point in time.
[3726.66 --> 3729.28]  I think Apple's busy alienating absolutely everyone.
[3729.56 --> 3729.82]  Yeah.
[3729.98 --> 3732.30]  Between the lawsuits against Samsung and...
[3732.30 --> 3733.76]  They're losing a lot of that right now.
[3733.84 --> 3734.40]  Have you heard about that?
[3734.54 --> 3734.92]  I have.
[3735.00 --> 3736.52]  They're losing like crazy left and right.
[3736.60 --> 3737.26]  They're losing everywhere.
[3737.26 --> 3740.84]  And the fact that it's almost like they're kind of going like this at Intel.
[3740.94 --> 3743.94]  You hear the latest thing where Apple says they want to develop their own CPU and move
[3743.94 --> 3745.14]  away from Intel or their notebooks.
[3745.32 --> 3748.36]  It's like, what's the point of even saying something like that?
[3749.36 --> 3749.48]  Look.
[3749.48 --> 3753.48]  I think they're literally just like...
[3753.48 --> 3754.94]  Ever since Steve Jobs passed away...
[3754.94 --> 3756.12]  Like, you look at the history of the company.
[3756.34 --> 3757.28]  Like, Steve Jobs starts the company.
[3757.40 --> 3757.68]  Yeah!
[3758.06 --> 3758.84]  Steve Jobs gets fired.
[3759.72 --> 3760.62]  Steve Jobs comes back.
[3760.68 --> 3760.96]  Yeah!
[3761.24 --> 3762.24]  Steve Jobs passes away.
[3762.66 --> 3763.72]  It's like, come on.
[3763.98 --> 3764.48]  They just...
[3764.48 --> 3768.00]  Like, the second he is gone, they just try and fight everyone?
[3768.26 --> 3770.04]  Like, how does that seem like a good strategy?
[3770.36 --> 3773.54]  Let's just, like, go fist to cuffs with every single company we can possibly do.
[3773.54 --> 3776.04]  Whereas, I mean, Steve Jobs was never afraid to go toe to toe.
[3776.24 --> 3776.52]  No.
[3776.70 --> 3777.96]  He'll go toe to toe with Google.
[3778.12 --> 3781.04]  But did it intelligently and had a plan.
[3781.38 --> 3785.02]  It's not just like throwing punches in every possible direction you can think of.
[3785.02 --> 3786.58]  I mean, why go up against Samsung?
[3787.00 --> 3787.64]  That was stupid.
[3788.00 --> 3788.72]  Like, Samsung.
[3789.16 --> 3789.88]  And like, why...
[3789.88 --> 3794.30]  Why push out Apple Maps when it just doesn't work?
[3795.32 --> 3797.18]  I still haven't upgraded to iOS 6.
[3797.24 --> 3797.72]  I've been lazy.
[3797.90 --> 3799.66]  I tried last night, but I needed a 50...
[3799.66 --> 3800.64]  I know there's a Google Map.
[3800.64 --> 3800.96]  Google Map.
[3800.98 --> 3803.10]  Yeah, that's the only reason I was considering it.
[3803.52 --> 3804.94]  Okay, I'm going to go get another topic.
[3805.04 --> 3805.82]  Maybe do a couple tweets.
[3805.94 --> 3810.06]  Apparently, it costs a dollar to send a private message to a non-friend on Facebook.
[3810.76 --> 3810.94]  Really?
[3811.50 --> 3812.56]  I've never heard of that before.
[3812.78 --> 3813.60]  I've never tried.
[3813.64 --> 3814.12]  I've never tried.
[3814.12 --> 3814.40]  Yeah.
[3814.82 --> 3815.46]  That's interesting.
[3816.64 --> 3818.26]  I wonder how they even work that in.
[3819.74 --> 3822.90]  How do you even send a message to someone who you're not a friend with on Facebook?
[3822.90 --> 3824.78]  I have no idea.
[3824.96 --> 3825.66]  I've never even...
[3825.66 --> 3826.96]  Oh, you're going to love this.
[3827.06 --> 3827.92]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[3828.40 --> 3830.12]  Really cool news.
[3830.84 --> 3836.36]  So, I'll be the first one to say Linux totally doesn't matter because I don't care about it.
[3836.70 --> 3840.20]  It has zero application to my life, but I know you're a bit of a Linux nerd.
[3840.22 --> 3841.60]  You use it every day, whether you...
[3841.60 --> 3843.60]  Okay.
[3843.60 --> 3843.96]  OCZ...
[3843.96 --> 3851.04]  Speaking of OCZ, has launched a beta application that enables SSD caching on Linux.
[3852.14 --> 3852.60]  So, wait...
[3853.38 --> 3854.84]  On regular SSDs.
[3855.00 --> 3856.30]  But I thought you didn't care about it.
[3857.38 --> 3858.90]  Well, I said you should care about this news.
[3859.10 --> 3859.72]  Oh, okay.
[3860.02 --> 3863.58]  You were all excited, so I thought you were like, I don't care about Linux, but I care about this.
[3863.64 --> 3865.46]  No, no, the implications of this are huge.
[3865.52 --> 3866.36]  No, yeah, that's awesome.
[3866.36 --> 3869.36]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, something, something, something.
[3869.74 --> 3876.90]  Aha, beta test program for its Linux acceleration software development and invites its enterprise SSD customers to participate.
[3877.42 --> 3883.84]  So, it's a fast caching storage solution for their SSDs designed specifically for Linux-based physical and virtual environments.
[3884.04 --> 3884.36]  That's awesome.
[3884.36 --> 3886.36]  So, basically, this is kind of like...
[3888.18 --> 3889.64]  This is kind of...
[3889.64 --> 3892.38]  Shoot, what's their accelerator drive called?
[3892.56 --> 3893.30]  The desktop one.
[3893.96 --> 3894.36]  Synapse.
[3894.50 --> 3895.44]  Yeah, Synapse cache.
[3895.44 --> 3899.70]  So, it's kind of like Synapse, except you can use any OCZ Enterprise SSD.
[3900.20 --> 3902.34]  You can cache a magnetic storage solution.
[3902.90 --> 3911.00]  And, unlike, you know, what, you know, Adaptek or, you know, LSI or whatever wants you to believe,
[3911.62 --> 3915.48]  unlike that, they are not locking it down to a hardware platform.
[3917.56 --> 3918.04]  Blah.
[3918.98 --> 3920.48]  If it works out, that's awesome.
[3920.56 --> 3921.34]  That's game-changing.
[3921.58 --> 3921.80]  Yeah.
[3921.80 --> 3922.68]  That's like...
[3922.68 --> 3923.30]  This is like...
[3923.30 --> 3924.76]  This is like the end of...
[3924.76 --> 3927.68]  The end of expensive hardware solutions for this.
[3928.70 --> 3929.22]  Potentially.
[3929.98 --> 3936.14]  Because it doesn't only work with SATA and SAS, it also works with PCI Express SSDs.
[3936.36 --> 3936.94]  Oh, nice.
[3936.98 --> 3937.52]  That's kind of cool.
[3937.52 --> 3941.28]  So, their entire enterprise thing is going to be...
[3941.28 --> 3941.86]  So, basically...
[3941.86 --> 3941.96]  Okay.
[3942.04 --> 3943.08]  So, imagine this server.
[3943.52 --> 3947.60]  Was it you where you were talking about that sort of uber density for you thing?
[3947.68 --> 3947.78]  Okay.
[3947.82 --> 3949.46]  So, what was the density they were able to achieve?
[3949.56 --> 3950.70]  I can't remember, but it was insane.
[3950.78 --> 3951.86]  It's called Red...
[3951.86 --> 3952.28]  Red something.
[3952.42 --> 3956.98]  It's this gigantic red server that just holds a billion hard drives.
[3956.98 --> 3957.28]  Okay.
[3957.36 --> 3958.18]  So, picture this.
[3958.40 --> 3960.70]  Something like that, where maybe you build like...
[3960.70 --> 3964.30]  You have like a 50 or a 100 terabyte storage server.
[3964.62 --> 3965.72]  Then you go, okay.
[3966.06 --> 3969.82]  Seven PCI Express slots with one terabyte of SSD each.
[3970.30 --> 3971.78]  A software-based solution.
[3971.90 --> 3973.14]  So, you don't even have to have...
[3973.14 --> 3979.74]  Like, you don't even have to have any cards in your system other than SSDs running off of wicked fast PCI Express.
[3980.56 --> 3981.62]  And these storage...
[3981.62 --> 3981.92]  Oh, no.
[3981.98 --> 3983.76]  I guess you'd need something to plug storage drives into.
[3984.42 --> 3984.96]  Oh, crap.
[3984.96 --> 3985.60]  Okay.
[3985.66 --> 3986.10]  Well, fine.
[3986.18 --> 3987.00]  So, you have a couple...
[3987.00 --> 3987.52]  Okay, fine.
[3987.56 --> 3988.76]  You have a couple SSDs then.
[3989.20 --> 3989.98]  And you get them to do...
[3989.98 --> 3991.12]  I know they do custom solutions.
[3991.28 --> 3994.12]  So, you go to OCZ and you say, look, we need four terabyte SSDs.
[3994.52 --> 3995.12]  And we need...
[3995.12 --> 3998.04]  So, you have like four running here to connect to all your hard drives.
[3998.10 --> 4000.28]  You have like three running here to be like...
[4000.28 --> 4003.26]  So, like 12 terabytes of like uber cash for the thing.
[4003.84 --> 4004.74]  I mean, that's...
[4004.74 --> 4007.40]  That's a whole new generation of performance, really.
[4007.56 --> 4007.74]  Yeah.
[4008.32 --> 4009.52]  Where instead of...
[4009.52 --> 4013.82]  Like, I remember hearing a really cool stat that Facebook was buying something like...
[4013.82 --> 4016.60]  Like some however many dozen servers every day.
[4016.94 --> 4017.10]  Yeah.
[4017.10 --> 4018.24]  Just to add to their racks.
[4018.72 --> 4022.50]  And I think it's everyone's Facebook front page has to be stored on SSD.
[4022.88 --> 4023.06]  Yeah.
[4023.06 --> 4026.08]  So, if they roll out something...
[4026.08 --> 4028.42]  So, if OCZ basically goes, look, here's our solution.
[4028.98 --> 4032.60]  Buy our SSDs, which are competitively priced as far as enterprise SSDs go.
[4032.70 --> 4034.18]  Because it's flashing a controller.
[4034.30 --> 4035.16]  It's not rocket science.
[4035.80 --> 4036.80]  Buy our SSDs.
[4036.92 --> 4041.64]  We have this Linux SSD caching system that's ready to go.
[4041.96 --> 4043.86]  You just deploy it.
[4044.08 --> 4045.64]  And it'll cache your magnetic storage.
[4045.84 --> 4048.50]  All of a sudden, you don't have to have dedicated SSDs for anything.
[4048.92 --> 4052.12]  It'll automatically cache the most frequently used data.
[4052.62 --> 4053.62]  The first load will be slow.
[4054.16 --> 4055.62]  Facebook would still need it.
[4055.66 --> 4056.80]  Okay, Facebook would still need it.
[4056.82 --> 4059.94]  Stuff that needs the entire thing on a dedicated SSD, yeah.
[4059.94 --> 4060.42]  Okay, yes.
[4060.68 --> 4062.28]  But, yeah.
[4062.88 --> 4063.78]  But, would they?
[4064.22 --> 4066.34]  Okay, front page would have to be on SSD.
[4066.50 --> 4071.00]  But everyone's front pages, after a little while, would eventually end up in the SSD cache anyway.
[4071.80 --> 4072.24]  Everyone's?
[4072.24 --> 4079.86]  Well, if they keep adding blades the way they're adding them, and every single one of them had, like, let's say 10% of the storage in every blade was SSD.
[4081.18 --> 4082.64]  Then, all the, all the, like.
[4082.64 --> 4086.82]  I think, well, like, this would come into tune with the thing that you're saying where you can contact OCZ and get a custom.
[4087.28 --> 4087.52]  Yes.
[4087.58 --> 4088.00]  Syncs up.
[4088.16 --> 4091.62]  So, Facebook would need their own kind of design for everything.
[4091.80 --> 4093.84]  They'd have a completely custom thing, I'm sure.
[4094.02 --> 4094.24]  Oh, yeah.
[4094.24 --> 4099.26]  And then they basically decide what is the appropriate ratio of SSD to hard drive.
[4099.26 --> 4112.28]  And as long as the caching solution is intelligent enough, and we've already seen, I mean, almost every, well, not everyone, but, you know, you look like guys like Dataplex, guys like LSI, Adaptac, all these guys have caching solutions.
[4112.68 --> 4114.28]  That's actually something I didn't think about.
[4114.40 --> 4118.42]  The LSI acquisition of Sandforce probably has huge implications for SSD caching.
[4119.16 --> 4120.42]  I'm sorry, I didn't think of that before.
[4120.42 --> 4124.92]  But anyway, so it's not rocket science at this point, I don't think.
[4125.52 --> 4134.28]  So, if they work it out so that as long as they've got the right ratio of magnetic to solid state storage, they wouldn't have to have dedicated SSD machines anymore, pretty much.
[4135.22 --> 4138.10]  They could just go, okay, put it in autopilot.
[4138.30 --> 4139.06]  Don't touch it anymore.
[4139.50 --> 4140.90]  Because it's all handed by the software.
[4143.06 --> 4147.84]  I think you're still going to want, if you're doing something like that, I think you're still going to want someone managing everything.
[4147.84 --> 4156.52]  But, I mean, okay, you look at stuff like a photo, that people look at once in a while, and if the loading time's a little bit slower, that could sit on magnetic.
[4157.54 --> 4163.08]  And if it could all be dynamically monitored, then great.
[4163.50 --> 4164.66]  Anyway, I thought that was cool.
[4165.22 --> 4167.40]  I thought you'd think it's cooler than you seem to think it is.
[4168.28 --> 4169.58]  I'm just sick.
[4169.58 --> 4171.20]  You're a constant disappointment to me.
[4173.40 --> 4174.14]  You're a jerk.
[4176.08 --> 4177.60]  I'm trying to find the name of that thing.
[4177.72 --> 4182.86]  It's just gigantic for you, and it's painted red, and it just has all the hard drives.
[4183.60 --> 4184.08]  It's ridiculous.
[4185.58 --> 4187.20]  Got any more topics, or should I go to Twitter?
[4190.34 --> 4193.18]  Oh, Intel Ivy Bridge ships made it below 13 watts.
[4193.18 --> 4194.14]  So that's cool.
[4194.92 --> 4206.66]  So we're talking, like, desktop processors that, so step down further, depending on the situation, to as little as 7 watts, which would be amazing for tablets, because I'm super stoked on Windows 8, like proper Windows 8 tablets.
[4206.84 --> 4207.26]  Oh, yeah, 100%.
[4207.26 --> 4208.40]  So that's cool.
[4208.82 --> 4210.96]  But I don't think I want to talk about that for that long.
[4214.88 --> 4215.88]  I don't know, you got anything?
[4217.56 --> 4218.22]  Not really.
[4218.22 --> 4222.22]  I have a suggestion for blah, blah, blah.
[4224.34 --> 4229.00]  Brindic H asks, do you think it's possible for Valve to push the main PC gaming market to Linux?
[4229.76 --> 4230.02]  No.
[4230.50 --> 4230.86]  No?
[4231.00 --> 4231.84]  I don't think so either.
[4232.04 --> 4232.24]  No.
[4232.42 --> 4234.50]  But, how do I bring up...
[4234.50 --> 4236.00]  I love you, Gabe, but it's not going to happen.
[4236.02 --> 4236.34]  There we go.
[4236.98 --> 4238.50]  But I don't think...
[4238.50 --> 4241.06]  I think he's wanting to make it viable for his Steam Box.
[4242.30 --> 4246.38]  Yeah, but even then, like...
[4246.38 --> 4247.98]  I think it'll be viable.
[4248.22 --> 4254.04]  But people are going to use what they're used to, and people are going to use what they currently like, and that's, in the most part, Windows.
[4254.18 --> 4254.98]  And you could...
[4254.98 --> 4265.50]  Okay, even if you were to make the argument that Windows has peaked and is on the downtrend in terms of its market dominance or whatever else, whatever other argument you're going to make,
[4265.50 --> 4274.94]  I would say that the tail on that is so long that Gabe Newell may not even live to see the end of Windows as the dominant gaming platform for the PC.
[4275.20 --> 4275.36]  Yeah.
[4275.36 --> 4285.16]  Like, even if this is the apex, the library and the tool sets and all of this stuff is so deeply entrenched.
[4285.16 --> 4290.22]  For anything but casual, I don't see it happening.
[4290.64 --> 4291.34]  Anytime soon.
[4291.34 --> 4295.90]  Yeah, but then at the same time, you see, like, it's not just Gabe.
[4296.02 --> 4297.04]  It's not just Steam.
[4297.04 --> 4299.16]  Because, um...
[4299.16 --> 4301.26]  You see, like, any Kickstarter game.
[4302.20 --> 4303.26]  Any Kickstarter game.
[4303.34 --> 4308.30]  They push the game, and then there's a billion comments of people asking, like, make a stretch goal for Linux.
[4308.42 --> 4310.86]  And their first stretch goal is, like, always Linux.
[4310.96 --> 4311.74]  Like, people care.
[4312.06 --> 4313.06]  And it's becoming a bigger thing.
[4313.16 --> 4314.04]  And, like, not necessarily...
[4314.04 --> 4315.08]  It's a really vocal minority.
[4315.72 --> 4318.18]  Yes, but then not necessarily just North America.
[4318.96 --> 4319.92]  You gotta think about that, too.
[4320.34 --> 4323.18]  A huge amount of the rest of the world uses a lot of Linux.
[4323.42 --> 4323.94]  Fair enough.
[4325.34 --> 4327.10]  North America, not so much.
[4327.66 --> 4328.16]  Like, at all.
[4328.54 --> 4328.74]  But...
[4328.74 --> 4328.96]  Right.
[4329.28 --> 4335.92]  And bearing in mind that North America, for markets like games, just dwarfs almost everything else.
[4335.98 --> 4336.48]  No, that's true.
[4336.62 --> 4336.90]  I know.
[4336.90 --> 4339.22]  But it's, like, it's happening.
[4340.04 --> 4340.38]  It's...
[4340.38 --> 4341.12]  I agree with you.
[4341.12 --> 4341.94]  But again, long tail.
[4342.02 --> 4342.04]  I agree with you.
[4342.04 --> 4343.46]  Very long tail, but it is happening.
[4343.70 --> 4344.00]  Very long tail.
[4344.00 --> 4347.08]  And I know a ton of people that will get rid of their Windows partition now.
[4347.16 --> 4347.34]  Okay.
[4347.36 --> 4349.60]  But it's more people that are already dual booting with Linux.
[4349.60 --> 4349.84]  Yes.
[4350.10 --> 4354.78]  And which is, like, a sliver of a sliver of computer users.
[4354.78 --> 4356.90]  I'm just saying it will convert some people.
[4356.94 --> 4360.34]  Here's the other thing that will be devastating for something like Linux adoption.
[4360.56 --> 4366.74]  And it comes down to our same conversation about the longer upgrade cycles that people have these days.
[4366.82 --> 4366.94]  Yep.
[4367.04 --> 4373.74]  And that is the fact that so many people are still running Windows XP machines that are fast enough
[4373.74 --> 4377.30]  for every casual game that comes out in the next five to ten years.
[4377.30 --> 4377.64]  Yeah.
[4377.64 --> 4377.70]  Yeah.
[4377.90 --> 4386.02]  So not only does Linux have to go up against the dominance of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows...
[4386.02 --> 4387.26]  Well, Vista to a lesser extent.
[4387.26 --> 4388.12]  But they're out there.
[4388.18 --> 4389.32]  There are Vista machines out there.
[4389.32 --> 4396.70]  But they have to go up against that every game, for however long from now, is going to run on Windows XP.
[4397.64 --> 4400.26]  Like, it's still a requirement.
[4400.54 --> 4400.64]  Yeah.
[4400.64 --> 4404.02]  So it's like, how many platforms do you want to build for?
[4404.78 --> 4405.34]  Yeah, for sure.
[4407.32 --> 4407.72]  Yeah.
[4408.00 --> 4409.66]  Like, that's part of the reason the tail...
[4409.66 --> 4417.26]  So I think that upgrade cycle is going to continue to extend, especially as NVIDIA and Intel slow down their development
[4417.26 --> 4421.64]  and release products less frequently, your computer will be good enough for longer.
[4422.00 --> 4425.94]  And with the quality of the components that, especially on the custom side,
[4426.04 --> 4428.94]  these motherboard manufacturers and VGA manufacturers are using,
[4429.06 --> 4432.46]  it's like, when would I ever have to replace the Maximus 5 formula?
[4432.78 --> 4432.96]  Yeah.
[4432.96 --> 4438.42]  I think every component on that board is rated for something like 15 years of continuous operation.
[4438.62 --> 4439.46]  It's just ridiculous.
[4439.94 --> 4440.90]  And like those new...
[4440.90 --> 4442.64]  The AX power supplies from Corsair.
[4442.76 --> 4442.92]  Yeah.
[4442.92 --> 4447.24]  And like, some of the new SSDs that are coming out, they're all just absolutely ridiculous.
[4447.32 --> 4452.24]  I mean, it used to be that when you bought, like, high-end power supply,
[4452.48 --> 4457.18]  you were paying for the fact that it wouldn't die after three years.
[4457.40 --> 4457.62]  Yeah.
[4458.06 --> 4462.10]  Whereas now, you take for granted that it's going to last five to ten years.
[4462.22 --> 4462.72]  Oh, seriously.
[4462.92 --> 4465.24]  And you've even got, like, seven-year warranties on stuff.
[4465.30 --> 4472.18]  I mean, guys, a manufacturer gives you a warranty that is, like, a fraction of how long they actually expect it to last.
[4472.18 --> 4475.02]  Like, your appliances have a one to two-year warranty.
[4475.38 --> 4477.52]  They expect that thing to last ten plus years.
[4477.64 --> 4479.06]  Think about that in terms of your computer.
[4479.18 --> 4481.18]  If they're giving you a five-year warranty, they...
[4481.74 --> 4483.48]  It's not going to die, basically.
[4483.58 --> 4489.08]  The only thing I can think of that is going the other direction is, like, TVs and monitors.
[4490.28 --> 4491.52]  They're becoming commodity.
[4492.26 --> 4492.44]  Yeah.
[4492.66 --> 4493.38]  I totally agree.
[4493.56 --> 4498.52]  But, like, old-school TVs, like, CRT-style stuff, just, like, still works.
[4498.52 --> 4499.92]  Let me put it this way.
[4500.26 --> 4509.80]  NCIX has a 39-inch LED-backlit 120Hz TV that's going to be in the Boxing Week sale, and you guys didn't hear this from me, at $299.
[4510.36 --> 4510.94]  What?
[4511.78 --> 4512.34]  Wow.
[4512.76 --> 4521.48]  So this is a 39-inch TV, which is 1080p, which basically costs as much as even, like, six months to a year ago.
[4522.36 --> 4523.18]  Oh, yeah.
[4523.26 --> 4524.96]  Like a 22, 23-inch monitor.
[4524.96 --> 4525.74]  Oh, that's crazy.
[4525.74 --> 4526.30]  Yeah.
[4526.96 --> 4531.12]  TVs don't use TN panels, so that's something to bear in mind, too.
[4531.24 --> 4531.56]  Oh, yeah.
[4531.72 --> 4537.16]  So it's not like they get to use a TN panel to cheap out, unless they are, like, super cheap TVs.
[4538.40 --> 4543.74]  And the material costs are obviously higher, because it's just larger.
[4544.00 --> 4546.84]  Yeah, in, like, every possible way of defining that.
[4547.18 --> 4550.66]  Like, just the plastic mold to create the bezel...
[4550.66 --> 4551.28]  Is larger.
[4551.48 --> 4552.02]  ...costs more.
[4552.02 --> 4552.56]  Like, everything is just...
[4552.56 --> 4553.52]  Everything costs more.
[4553.60 --> 4554.06]  Yeah, yeah.
[4554.06 --> 4557.00]  How could they afford to make it last for 10 years?
[4557.46 --> 4557.98]  No, I know.
[4558.14 --> 4562.34]  But I'm just saying, like, that's the only thing I can possibly think of that's going the other way.
[4563.62 --> 4565.60]  Yeah, even things like light bulbs last longer, yeah.
[4565.96 --> 4567.46]  Everything just seems to last longer.
[4567.70 --> 4570.58]  But the only thing I can possibly think of is TVs and screens.
[4571.26 --> 4571.84]  And phones.
[4571.84 --> 4575.10]  Yeah, phones used to be built by tanks.
[4575.28 --> 4575.72]  Oh, my goodness.
[4575.76 --> 4579.48]  That old Nokia one that you could, like, literally drive over with a tank, and it just wouldn't
[4579.48 --> 4579.70]  care.
[4579.80 --> 4580.58]  I think I had that one.
[4580.62 --> 4581.28]  Was it the blue one?
[4581.76 --> 4583.40]  Yeah, it was this very iconic.
[4583.46 --> 4584.34]  Black and white screen, right?
[4584.40 --> 4585.44]  For some reason, I can't remember.
[4585.56 --> 4587.60]  Yeah, it's yellowy kind of...
[4587.60 --> 4588.72]  Or, like, orange backlit.
[4588.82 --> 4589.42]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4589.50 --> 4589.68]  Yeah.
[4589.68 --> 4592.48]  I can't remember the name of it, but it's like...
[4592.48 --> 4593.08]  Okay, I don't know.
[4593.16 --> 4594.00]  I had one, though.
[4594.08 --> 4595.36]  Such a well-known Nokia phone.
[4595.44 --> 4596.84]  But, like, that thing was a beast.
[4597.00 --> 4599.26]  And a lot of old-school phones were just absolute beasts.
[4599.36 --> 4599.56]  Oh, yeah.
[4599.58 --> 4600.72]  I used to drop it all the time.
[4600.78 --> 4604.02]  And now, like, I kind of worry about this one.
[4604.10 --> 4606.16]  And if I had an iPhone, I would just constantly worry about it.
[4606.16 --> 4611.54]  Now they do a drop test on, like, YouTube just to prove that it won't break after one
[4611.54 --> 4611.92]  drop.
[4612.02 --> 4613.56]  Which is brutal.
[4614.68 --> 4616.30]  And they're slipperier than ever.
[4616.60 --> 4616.80]  Yeah.
[4616.80 --> 4619.88]  But you can see, like, I obviously worry.
[4620.04 --> 4622.08]  I have an OtterBox, which is my case.
[4622.26 --> 4624.64]  And that's, like, armor for your phone.
[4624.94 --> 4628.14]  Because I'm just, like, seriously worried that it will just break if I ever do anything
[4628.14 --> 4628.68]  bad to it.
[4629.30 --> 4630.92]  Oh, you know what we can talk about?
[4631.10 --> 4632.28]  How much time do we have left?
[4634.62 --> 4635.20]  It's 10 minutes.
[4635.20 --> 4636.26]  We've got, like, 11 minutes.
[4636.32 --> 4636.48]  Okay.
[4637.16 --> 4638.80]  So I want to talk about a new idea.
[4638.80 --> 4640.66]  I'm thinking I'm going to start this in January.
[4640.94 --> 4643.48]  We'll use the forum as part of a launch thing.
[4643.48 --> 4648.58]  So for all of you guys watching here, I'm assuming if you're tuning in live that you're
[4648.58 --> 4650.92]  probably someone who, you know, watches my videos.
[4655.36 --> 4656.86]  YouTubers need likes.
[4657.52 --> 4658.42]  They need likes.
[4658.54 --> 4659.34]  They need comments.
[4659.44 --> 4660.30]  And they need shares.
[4660.30 --> 4665.54]  One of the biggest things that I've noticed about my videos is a lot of people watch them,
[4665.62 --> 4667.42]  but apparently nobody actually likes them.
[4669.16 --> 4672.56]  Which is, I mean, I hope that's not actually the case.
[4673.40 --> 4675.74]  But if the 3310, okay?
[4675.76 --> 4677.08]  I don't know if that's the one I had or not.
[4677.94 --> 4680.94]  But how do I address this?
[4681.14 --> 4682.78]  I don't want to plead for likes.
[4683.28 --> 4684.18]  I think it's lame.
[4684.88 --> 4688.12]  If you look back at my older videos, I didn't even ask people to subscribe.
[4688.58 --> 4693.18]  Because I always took kind of the, hey, if people want to watch my videos and they want
[4693.18 --> 4694.84]  to subscribe, that's cool.
[4695.28 --> 4696.28]  Sorry for my voice.
[4696.38 --> 4698.22]  Wanted to be the most organic as possible.
[4698.36 --> 4703.26]  Wanted to be people that really actually really desired to see more instead of just felt
[4703.26 --> 4704.52]  incentive to see more.
[4704.52 --> 4708.84]  legit wanting to subscribe or wanting to like the video or whatever else.
[4709.00 --> 4714.02]  But what I'm looking at now is more and more and more YouTube is tweaking their algorithms
[4714.02 --> 4715.64]  to focus on engagement.
[4716.20 --> 4719.84]  So they're looking for how many people like the video, how many people comment on it,
[4720.10 --> 4724.22]  how related the comments are to the keywords and the title and the description,
[4724.54 --> 4729.34]  and how many people are sharing it, whether it's on Facebook or Twitter or on YouTube itself.
[4730.14 --> 4732.88]  And for those of you who are watching right now,
[4732.88 --> 4735.12]  consider this sort of my appeal to you.
[4735.52 --> 4736.78]  It's not that much work.
[4737.02 --> 4737.36]  In fact,
[4737.40 --> 4740.94]  you can download scripts that auto-like the video, every video you watch.
[4741.14 --> 4744.38]  And then you can manually dislike it if you don't like it or unlike it if you,
[4744.88 --> 4746.90]  if it turns out that you don't actually like it.
[4746.90 --> 4749.52]  I would hope you guys will do that.
[4750.02 --> 4756.08]  And so what I'm thinking is I'm actually going to create a program where every month we're
[4756.08 --> 4756.74]  going to contribute.
[4756.90 --> 4761.28]  Because as you guys know, there's ad revenue that goes along with having better search rankings.
[4761.28 --> 4765.96]  So, you know, if you guys are able to help me get better search rankings, get more views,
[4766.60 --> 4769.96]  build this community, build this viewership base,
[4770.36 --> 4772.40]  then I figure I should probably give something back.
[4772.78 --> 4776.66]  So what I'm thinking is we do either monthly or quarterly targets where I basically go,
[4776.66 --> 4782.98]  look, for every like on a Linus Tech Tips video this month,
[4783.12 --> 4786.40]  I'm going to contribute X number of cents.
[4786.64 --> 4789.84]  And it'll probably be like a fraction of a cent because the last thing,
[4789.90 --> 4791.78]  Every single like, that's just insane.
[4791.92 --> 4792.12]  Yeah.
[4792.18 --> 4795.96]  The last thing I need to do is go broke immediately because you guys are so gung-ho.
[4796.08 --> 4796.36]  And I mean,
[4796.38 --> 4797.66]  like I appreciate the support,
[4797.82 --> 4798.82]  but I also,
[4799.02 --> 4799.40]  you know,
[4799.44 --> 4800.56]  have a baby to feed.
[4800.56 --> 4803.24]  So I'm thinking we basically go,
[4803.36 --> 4803.44]  okay,
[4803.52 --> 4804.70]  for every like this month,
[4804.80 --> 4806.28]  we're going to contribute this much.
[4806.50 --> 4808.42]  And then with the forum that we're starting up,
[4808.66 --> 4812.20]  we can let the viewers decide what we do with the money.
[4812.72 --> 4814.16]  So we can basically go,
[4814.30 --> 4814.56]  okay,
[4814.94 --> 4815.98]  you know,
[4816.26 --> 4816.82]  we can,
[4816.86 --> 4818.44]  we can create a vote every month.
[4818.52 --> 4818.90]  We can go,
[4819.02 --> 4819.22]  okay,
[4819.62 --> 4819.90]  this,
[4820.42 --> 4820.72]  you know,
[4820.80 --> 4822.54]  moderator needs a new computer.
[4822.70 --> 4824.06]  Should we contribute to that?
[4824.24 --> 4826.58]  Or there's this charity that,
[4826.68 --> 4827.30]  you know,
[4827.50 --> 4829.68]  like I know particularly slick.
[4829.68 --> 4831.56]  MS is really important to him for,
[4831.68 --> 4832.80]  for some personal reasons.
[4833.42 --> 4833.92]  You know,
[4833.98 --> 4834.48]  for me,
[4834.66 --> 4838.00]  Alzheimer's and dementia is pretty important for some personal reasons.
[4838.56 --> 4839.82]  So there's a lot of different,
[4839.94 --> 4840.84]  different things like that.
[4840.88 --> 4845.50]  So we could basically create a list and let the community decide what we do with the money.
[4845.94 --> 4846.98]  So we can go,
[4847.06 --> 4847.20]  okay,
[4847.20 --> 4847.40]  look,
[4847.46 --> 4850.36]  this month we're going to do this up to a maximum of a thousand dollars.
[4850.54 --> 4851.72]  And then at the end of the month,
[4851.78 --> 4855.18]  you guys get to vote on what you want us to do with that thousand dollars.
[4855.28 --> 4858.06]  BC Children's Hospital is one I'd also really like to contribute to.
[4858.32 --> 4859.36]  We write a check,
[4859.68 --> 4860.52]  we film it,
[4860.64 --> 4861.26]  we mail it.
[4861.52 --> 4862.50]  And that way,
[4862.60 --> 4866.44]  instead of me having to sort of grovel for please like my video,
[4866.52 --> 4867.82]  which I think is just ridiculous.
[4868.34 --> 4872.34]  And I've held out as long as I can before even making any kind of appeal about it.
[4873.34 --> 4878.16]  I think it's a way for you guys to really contribute something by liking the video.
[4878.16 --> 4886.80]  And a way for me to give back to the general world for you guys helping sort of push the popularity of what we're doing up.
[4887.20 --> 4888.92]  So if you guys think that makes sense,
[4889.12 --> 4891.74]  let's take your tweets on that for the rest of the,
[4891.74 --> 4891.92]  uh,
[4891.92 --> 4892.94]  for the rest of the segment here.
[4893.58 --> 4896.12]  And like a lot of that interaction would come through.
[4896.12 --> 4896.58]  Like a lot.
[4898.58 --> 4898.98]  Ah,
[4899.98 --> 4900.58]  I like it.
[4900.66 --> 4900.96]  I like it.
[4901.04 --> 4901.26]  I like it.
[4901.26 --> 4901.70]  Um,
[4901.78 --> 4902.26]  um,
[4902.26 --> 4907.14]  a lot of those interactions would be done through the forum.
[4907.36 --> 4908.70]  I like it like that.
[4909.04 --> 4910.78]  I like it like that.
[4911.66 --> 4912.06]  Um,
[4912.06 --> 4914.36]  so you guys could vote through the forum,
[4914.36 --> 4915.02]  like we were saying.
[4915.50 --> 4916.10]  And like,
[4916.22 --> 4919.44]  say you guys did a Kiva loan or some type of recurring thing that would happen.
[4919.52 --> 4921.64]  You guys could orchestrate that whole process.
[4922.20 --> 4926.20]  So it would be a lot of interaction from you guys and a lot driven through the forum.
[4926.28 --> 4926.88]  And that's the thing.
[4926.94 --> 4927.72]  We need your help.
[4927.80 --> 4928.86]  That's a really good point.
[4929.18 --> 4933.14]  Because my whole thing is I don't want every video to be like,
[4933.48 --> 4935.02]  please like my videos.
[4935.16 --> 4936.70]  My baby needs to eat.
[4937.50 --> 4937.90]  Like I,
[4938.04 --> 4939.80]  it can't be like that.
[4939.86 --> 4940.82]  That's stupid.
[4941.20 --> 4941.90]  It's stupid.
[4941.90 --> 4942.82]  I think it's pathetic.
[4943.32 --> 4945.88]  And for all the other YouTubers who are watching me right now,
[4945.94 --> 4946.70]  I think it's pathetic.
[4946.84 --> 4947.36]  I really do.
[4947.88 --> 4949.16]  Pleading for likes is lame.
[4949.72 --> 4950.08]  Um,
[4950.42 --> 4953.60]  but what I would rely on you guys to do is to advocate.
[4953.90 --> 4954.22]  Like,
[4954.30 --> 4955.78]  I don't want to say in the video,
[4955.90 --> 4956.12]  guys,
[4956.24 --> 4957.90]  like the video and I'll donate to a charity.
[4958.04 --> 4959.18]  I want you guys to drive that.
[4959.58 --> 4960.54]  I want the top,
[4960.86 --> 4966.40]  I want the top rated comment under every video to be about what this month's thing is.
[4966.62 --> 4967.16]  It's like,
[4967.26 --> 4971.42]  like if you guys come up with a personal goal through the forum or something that you guys want to hit,
[4971.42 --> 4971.66]  like,
[4972.06 --> 4972.30]  Oh,
[4972.38 --> 4973.06]  something happened.
[4973.14 --> 4973.30]  Like,
[4973.36 --> 4977.30]  say there's a natural disaster and you guys want to push something towards that natural disaster.
[4977.62 --> 4977.98]  Exactly.
[4978.24 --> 4978.66]  We could,
[4978.74 --> 4982.58]  you guys could push for that and our donations would go towards that if it's the highest voted thing,
[4982.62 --> 4983.68]  which if it was a natural disaster,
[4983.80 --> 4984.42]  it probably would.
[4984.42 --> 4989.12]  And if you guys are all contributing together and supporting each other's ideas in the forum,
[4989.32 --> 4991.56]  which Slick will actually start working on tomorrow.
[4991.78 --> 4993.54]  Tomorrow's the beginning date.
[4993.66 --> 4994.20]  Tomorrow's the day.
[4994.20 --> 4995.04]  Uh,
[4995.04 --> 4995.28]  well,
[4995.52 --> 4996.00]  second day,
[4996.12 --> 4997.84]  but you haven't gotten much done on it yet.
[4997.88 --> 4998.66]  First day wasn't really,
[4998.80 --> 4998.94]  yeah.
[4998.96 --> 4999.12]  Yeah.
[4999.24 --> 4999.68]  First day is kind of a light off.
[4999.68 --> 5000.40]  Finals are over,
[5000.62 --> 5001.08]  basically.
[5001.64 --> 5001.78]  So,
[5001.96 --> 5002.14]  uh,
[5002.14 --> 5002.52]  so yeah,
[5002.62 --> 5002.82]  we're,
[5002.96 --> 5006.60]  I think we're pretty excited about this idea and we need you guys to advocate.
[5007.02 --> 5007.66]  And honestly,
[5007.84 --> 5008.04]  like,
[5008.12 --> 5008.86]  think about it this way.
[5008.86 --> 5010.06]  It really does help me a lot.
[5010.24 --> 5011.42]  The sooner you guys get started,
[5011.98 --> 5013.44]  the better,
[5013.58 --> 5014.28]  the better it will be.
[5014.28 --> 5019.88]  Even though I know we're not doing a target for December and I'm not a hundred percent sure if I'll be able to launch in time for January.
[5020.14 --> 5021.06]  But tell you what,
[5021.12 --> 5021.86]  I'll commit now,
[5022.24 --> 5023.38]  February for sure,
[5023.74 --> 5027.18]  I'll commit at least 500 bucks as like a,
[5027.18 --> 5028.28]  as a ceiling for this,
[5028.36 --> 5029.16]  for this new program.
[5029.28 --> 5031.42]  And then what I'd like is for as,
[5031.64 --> 5034.08]  what I'd like,
[5034.26 --> 5034.44]  uh,
[5034.44 --> 5036.44]  what I'd like is for as we keep going,
[5037.20 --> 5037.48]  you know,
[5037.48 --> 5040.08]  if I'm pushing you guys to hit a bigger and bigger target,
[5040.30 --> 5042.78]  then I want to contribute bigger and bigger amounts of money.
[5043.02 --> 5044.26]  I think that's how this should work.
[5045.10 --> 5045.48]  Okay.
[5045.58 --> 5045.86]  So yeah,
[5045.90 --> 5046.14]  let's,
[5046.24 --> 5047.34]  let's do some tweets about this.
[5047.76 --> 5048.80]  So swag.
[5048.96 --> 5049.28]  Okay.
[5049.44 --> 5049.66]  Cool.
[5050.20 --> 5050.36]  Uh,
[5050.36 --> 5050.88]  do it.
[5051.20 --> 5053.48]  Can you buy front panel cables that are sleeve?
[5053.58 --> 5053.98]  So they don't know,
[5054.02 --> 5054.78]  but you can sleeve them.
[5055.04 --> 5055.22]  Yeah.
[5055.40 --> 5056.06]  You can sleeve them yourself.
[5056.42 --> 5057.18]  Seems legit.
[5057.76 --> 5059.72]  When will the AMD never settle promotion end?
[5059.84 --> 5060.20]  Um,
[5060.28 --> 5062.20]  it's going to end when they run out of codes.
[5062.34 --> 5064.00]  So you should still be okay on boxing day.
[5065.30 --> 5066.40]  Oh my God,
[5066.50 --> 5067.08]  blaze.
[5067.48 --> 5069.44]  I don't know.
[5069.62 --> 5069.86]  Okay.
[5070.20 --> 5072.52]  Can you tell me which components are needed for computer graphics?
[5072.54 --> 5072.56]  Oh,
[5072.56 --> 5073.08]  blaze.
[5073.42 --> 5073.64]  What?
[5074.10 --> 5076.38]  I wonder if that's the name of that server that I'm thinking of.
[5076.60 --> 5077.00]  I don't know.
[5077.08 --> 5077.30]  Whatever.
[5077.50 --> 5078.80]  The big red thing that holds up.
[5078.80 --> 5078.90]  Oh,
[5078.98 --> 5079.14]  okay.
[5079.26 --> 5079.46]  Sure.
[5079.90 --> 5080.66]  That might be something to do with that.
[5080.66 --> 5082.72]  Hardware and software needed for computer graphics?
[5083.10 --> 5083.46]  Uh,
[5083.62 --> 5085.04]  it depends what kind of computer graphics.
[5085.44 --> 5086.74]  We talked about Tegra 4 a little bit.
[5086.78 --> 5088.16]  Looks ballin'.
[5088.16 --> 5088.50]  Yeah,
[5088.60 --> 5089.14]  looks awesome.
[5089.14 --> 5091.50]  I gave away my gunner glasses to Slick.
[5091.58 --> 5093.36]  Should I read between the lines on your opinion on them?
[5093.60 --> 5093.78]  No,
[5093.78 --> 5095.90]  my opinion is that they do reduce eye fatigue.
[5096.12 --> 5096.68]  Hundred percent.
[5096.96 --> 5098.60]  If you sit at your computer for a long time,
[5098.78 --> 5099.44]  they work.
[5099.76 --> 5104.66]  What I didn't like about them is my eyes are sort of going a little bit right now as it is.
[5104.78 --> 5106.78]  They have a bit of magnification on them.
[5107.08 --> 5108.30]  So it's not a prescription.
[5108.30 --> 5110.10]  It is a magnification.
[5110.68 --> 5112.74]  And what I found is that for my eyes,
[5113.04 --> 5114.84]  even though they were much less fatigued,
[5115.10 --> 5118.54]  I was having more trouble focusing on things when I'm not at my computer.
[5119.00 --> 5120.86]  So that was what I didn't like about them.
[5121.20 --> 5121.46]  Um,
[5121.46 --> 5122.42]  when I sit at my computer,
[5122.80 --> 5123.36]  hundred percent,
[5123.54 --> 5123.96]  they help.
[5125.06 --> 5125.40]  Yeah,
[5125.54 --> 5128.36]  I've actually used them and have the exact same use case.
[5129.48 --> 5130.74]  I want to settle a debate.
[5131.04 --> 5131.72]  What memory is better?
[5131.80 --> 5134.78]  Two by four at 1333 or one by eight at 1600?
[5135.00 --> 5136.26]  Two by four at 1333.
[5136.26 --> 5136.62]  However,
[5136.82 --> 5140.60]  I would probably go one by eight at 1600 because it gives you more upgrade options.
[5141.20 --> 5144.54]  And it's not going to make that much of a difference in terms of performance anyway.
[5145.24 --> 5147.04]  What's your favorite apps with your galaxy?
[5148.14 --> 5150.26]  I covered that actually earlier in the episode.
[5150.38 --> 5151.26]  There's a few more.
[5151.54 --> 5152.20]  Watch the archive.
[5152.56 --> 5152.72]  Yeah,
[5152.82 --> 5153.86]  maybe I'll jump on Twitter later.
[5154.02 --> 5155.06]  Favorite mechanical keyboards.
[5155.14 --> 5156.08]  I know we cover this a lot.
[5156.18 --> 5156.74]  Zybul 60.
[5157.96 --> 5158.92]  Big red for you.
[5159.08 --> 5160.02]  Backblaze storage pod.
[5160.10 --> 5160.40]  That's it.
[5160.48 --> 5160.86]  Hundred percent.
[5160.98 --> 5161.28]  Okay.
[5162.56 --> 5163.76]  We were going to get to that.
[5164.46 --> 5165.30]  Oh crap.
[5165.30 --> 5166.16]  We almost forgot that.
[5166.26 --> 5166.78]  Right.
[5167.16 --> 5167.50]  Oh,
[5167.70 --> 5168.00]  yes.
[5168.40 --> 5169.80]  I put it here so I wouldn't forget.
[5169.98 --> 5170.12]  Okay.
[5170.20 --> 5170.36]  Sorry.
[5170.44 --> 5170.58]  Sorry.
[5170.64 --> 5170.76]  Sorry.
[5170.82 --> 5171.56]  We'll go back to it.
[5171.70 --> 5171.92]  Guys,
[5172.08 --> 5176.06]  keep sending in your comments on the money likes thing.
[5176.06 --> 5176.58]  Okay.
[5179.52 --> 5179.72]  So,
[5179.88 --> 5180.88]  did I tell you about this?
[5181.50 --> 5181.68]  You,
[5182.04 --> 5182.16]  I,
[5182.44 --> 5183.40]  these are Twinkies,
[5183.48 --> 5183.58]  right?
[5183.58 --> 5183.86]  Yes.
[5183.96 --> 5184.20]  Okay.
[5184.64 --> 5184.96]  So,
[5185.18 --> 5190.32]  this is the first time I have ever actually received mail from a viewer.
[5191.00 --> 5192.26]  Dear Linus Sebastian,
[5192.26 --> 5192.34]  question.
[5192.62 --> 5195.72]  I heard on one of your live streams that you have never had a Twinkie.
[5196.16 --> 5198.36]  I figured that because it is the Christmas season,
[5198.50 --> 5202.36]  I would give a gift on behalf of all the hard work you do to bring us Linus Tech Tips,
[5202.46 --> 5202.98]  your live stream,
[5203.06 --> 5204.76]  and all the other channels you're associated with.
[5205.00 --> 5208.60]  I hope you enjoy your first Twinkie and have a very Merry Christmas.
[5208.60 --> 5209.96]  Sincerely,
[5210.20 --> 5213.30]  at Ryan9298B2 on Twitter.
[5214.30 --> 5214.90]  Postscript,
[5215.04 --> 5216.10]  RIP hostess.
[5216.82 --> 5217.28]  So,
[5217.42 --> 5218.72]  I don't know if you remember this,
[5218.86 --> 5219.04]  Ryan,
[5219.54 --> 5223.84]  but neither Slick nor I have ever eaten a Twinkie before.
[5223.96 --> 5224.06]  So,
[5224.12 --> 5225.60]  this is a sealed Twinkie box.
[5226.52 --> 5226.78]  Okay.
[5227.20 --> 5227.62]  And guys,
[5227.70 --> 5231.20]  I'm not encouraging everyone to send me mail because I don't need,
[5231.24 --> 5232.10]  I don't need more mail,
[5232.26 --> 5233.22]  to be perfectly honest.
[5233.38 --> 5233.94]  But,
[5234.04 --> 5238.58]  I was really touched because this is the first time I've ever gotten mail from a
[5238.58 --> 5241.22]  from a viewer and it's the Christmas season and all that.
[5241.66 --> 5241.86]  So,
[5242.04 --> 5242.28]  okay,
[5242.36 --> 5242.68]  Twinkie,
[5242.76 --> 5243.80]  live Twinkie unboxing.
[5244.46 --> 5244.70]  So,
[5244.80 --> 5247.78]  let's see what hostess has to say for themselves about the Twinkie.
[5247.90 --> 5251.66]  The product is enlarged to show detail of the texture.
[5252.10 --> 5256.08]  There are 10 individually wrapped cakes with a best before date of December,
[5256.26 --> 5256.38]  oh,
[5256.44 --> 5257.54]  December 14th.
[5257.54 --> 5258.80]  I should have probably eaten it right away.
[5258.82 --> 5259.44]  What year though?
[5259.76 --> 5259.96]  Oh,
[5259.96 --> 5260.38]  I don't know.
[5261.06 --> 5261.48]  This year.
[5261.56 --> 5261.88]  That's okay.
[5261.92 --> 5262.70]  I'm going to eat it anyway.
[5263.20 --> 5264.04]  It's probably fine.
[5264.32 --> 5266.22]  Golden sponge cake with creamy filling.
[5266.72 --> 5267.80]  Follow us on Facebook.
[5267.80 --> 5270.10]  Don't miss out on all the great new recipes,
[5270.26 --> 5271.22]  sweet exclusive offers.
[5271.34 --> 5273.50]  The ingredients include nutritional facts that are,
[5273.60 --> 5273.70]  okay,
[5273.76 --> 5274.84]  I'm sort of skipping through here.
[5275.16 --> 5275.46]  So,
[5275.52 --> 5276.02]  here we go.
[5276.92 --> 5278.14]  When we open up the box,
[5278.40 --> 5279.22]  we discover
[5279.22 --> 5281.72]  that inside,
[5282.16 --> 5283.96]  there are 10 golden treats.
[5283.96 --> 5285.74]  one for you.
[5285.74 --> 5286.06]  Oh,
[5286.06 --> 5286.40]  God.
[5287.04 --> 5288.08]  And one for me.
[5290.92 --> 5291.96]  I have to say,
[5292.04 --> 5295.84]  part of the reason I've never had a Twinkie is it's never really held much appeal for me.
[5296.92 --> 5302.66]  All I remember growing up as a kid is the only thing that lives through a nuclear holocaust is cockroaches and Twinkies.
[5302.66 --> 5304.26]  I was always just like,
[5304.34 --> 5305.62]  I'm okay.
[5306.12 --> 5306.46]  Yeah,
[5306.58 --> 5308.28]  I always sort of took that approach to it too.
[5309.28 --> 5309.48]  So,
[5309.56 --> 5309.98]  here we go.
[5310.14 --> 5311.68]  We're having our first Twinkie experience.
[5311.80 --> 5312.20]  And there's,
[5312.28 --> 5312.56]  of course,
[5312.64 --> 5313.70]  nothing erotic about it.
[5313.70 --> 5322.58]  It's a little dry.
[5325.58 --> 5326.18]  Oh,
[5326.26 --> 5326.46]  cold.
[5327.18 --> 5327.70]  Mmm,
[5327.74 --> 5328.24]  it's cold.
[5328.74 --> 5329.00]  Okay?
[5331.08 --> 5332.06]  It tastes good,
[5332.48 --> 5333.72]  but it also tastes like,
[5334.80 --> 5335.80]  just fat.
[5337.60 --> 5338.04]  Yeah,
[5338.10 --> 5339.26]  it's like bread with,
[5339.34 --> 5339.62]  like,
[5339.82 --> 5340.00]  you know,
[5340.04 --> 5340.96]  fake whipped cream in it.
[5341.30 --> 5342.60]  If I had real whipped cream,
[5343.70 --> 5345.22]  I'm going to finish it though,
[5345.86 --> 5347.00]  just for Ryan's sake.
[5352.62 --> 5353.02]  So,
[5353.08 --> 5353.38]  thank you,
[5353.44 --> 5353.66]  Ryan.
[5356.30 --> 5358.16]  I got a chance to eat a Twinkie,
[5358.80 --> 5360.98]  before they were gone forever.
[5361.62 --> 5361.98]  And,
[5362.66 --> 5363.64]  just for that,
[5364.16 --> 5366.44]  we are going to take one of these Twinkies,
[5366.78 --> 5367.66]  or the box,
[5367.96 --> 5369.54]  and we are putting it on the wall of legend.
[5370.24 --> 5370.64]  Because,
[5371.12 --> 5373.02]  this is the first viewer mail,
[5373.02 --> 5374.80]  that we have ever received.
[5374.88 --> 5375.64]  It was very thoughtful,
[5376.32 --> 5376.66]  and,
[5376.70 --> 5377.54]  thank you very much.
[5377.90 --> 5378.44]  Merry Christmas,
[5378.58 --> 5378.84]  as well.
[5381.14 --> 5381.48]  Yeah,
[5381.52 --> 5382.60]  I guess this is the last stream,
[5382.66 --> 5383.18]  before Christmas.
[5383.54 --> 5384.04]  Sure is.
[5386.52 --> 5386.84]  Okay.
[5388.18 --> 5389.42]  Speaking of Christmas spirit,
[5389.50 --> 5390.20]  and giving all that,
[5390.28 --> 5391.34]  let's go back to our Twitter thing.
[5391.62 --> 5391.88]  Okay.
[5392.88 --> 5393.08]  Oh,
[5393.14 --> 5393.36]  wow.
[5393.94 --> 5394.18]  Yeah,
[5394.18 --> 5396.26]  I'm actually pleasantly surprised.
[5396.34 --> 5396.48]  Which,
[5396.58 --> 5397.30]  it's unfortunate,
[5397.48 --> 5398.54]  that it's kind of growing on me,
[5398.54 --> 5399.04]  as I go.
[5399.36 --> 5400.16]  Because now they're going to be like,
[5400.24 --> 5400.44]  no,
[5400.52 --> 5400.74]  no,
[5400.80 --> 5401.00]  no.
[5402.08 --> 5402.40]  Soon,
[5402.48 --> 5403.98]  it will definitely not be a Twinkie,
[5404.04 --> 5404.40]  up on the wall.
[5404.46 --> 5405.62]  It's going to be the empty box,
[5405.90 --> 5407.14]  after Linus eats the whole thing.
[5408.34 --> 5408.62]  Jeez,
[5408.68 --> 5408.82]  man,
[5408.84 --> 5409.40]  you're giving me away.
[5410.70 --> 5410.96]  Okay,
[5411.18 --> 5412.00]  so come back up to the top.
[5414.22 --> 5415.16]  122 new interactions.
[5415.28 --> 5415.62]  Here we go.
[5416.18 --> 5416.58]  Okay.
[5416.58 --> 5416.62]  Okay.
[5416.62 --> 5417.18]  Okay.
[5417.18 --> 5417.58]  Okay.
[5417.58 --> 5417.94]  Okay.
[5417.94 --> 5418.92]  Info on treating Alzheimer's,
[5418.94 --> 5419.72]  for knowledgeable men.
[5419.90 --> 5420.10]  Okay,
[5420.16 --> 5420.52]  I'm not,
[5420.64 --> 5421.38]  I'm not a doctor.
[5421.48 --> 5422.40]  I'm not trying to treat it.
[5422.50 --> 5423.40]  It's just helpful.
[5424.90 --> 5425.16]  Okay.
[5425.80 --> 5426.16]  Jose,
[5427.04 --> 5428.26]  great suggestion,
[5428.78 --> 5431.14]  but we'll leave it up to the community at large to decide.
[5431.72 --> 5432.00]  I mean,
[5432.24 --> 5432.78]  Slick and I,
[5433.04 --> 5434.14]  might have some influence,
[5434.24 --> 5434.90]  like some months.
[5434.98 --> 5435.54]  We might just say,
[5435.60 --> 5435.72]  look,
[5435.78 --> 5436.40]  we're doing this.
[5437.84 --> 5438.10]  You know,
[5438.10 --> 5438.62]  get on board.
[5438.80 --> 5439.78]  Whereas most of the time,
[5439.78 --> 5441.28]  I'd really like the communicate to do.
[5441.52 --> 5442.68]  The community to decide.
[5442.80 --> 5444.70]  I think a large part of the whole point,
[5444.80 --> 5446.48]  is to have it all community driven,
[5446.48 --> 5448.24]  and a lot of interaction from the fans and whatnot.
[5448.40 --> 5449.56]  Kwame points out,
[5449.66 --> 5450.16]  points out,
[5450.24 --> 5451.92]  points out that the cockroach thing is a myth.
[5452.56 --> 5453.84]  Which I sort of assumed.
[5454.02 --> 5454.18]  Yeah.
[5454.80 --> 5455.98]  Take that Twinkie hard.
[5457.12 --> 5458.62]  What about the upcoming gaming bundle?
[5459.00 --> 5459.32]  No,
[5459.38 --> 5459.44]  no,
[5459.46 --> 5461.14]  I didn't say I'll talk about it before the end of the stream.
[5461.20 --> 5462.12]  I said it's coming later.
[5462.68 --> 5462.84]  No,
[5462.88 --> 5462.96]  no,
[5462.96 --> 5463.40]  that's later,
[5463.48 --> 5463.64]  later.
[5467.32 --> 5468.16]  Best show ever.
[5468.16 --> 5469.26]  Linus Twinkie tips.
[5470.46 --> 5471.60]  Throw away the Twinkie drivers.
[5471.76 --> 5473.32]  Download the latest from hostess.com.
[5473.38 --> 5473.48]  Yeah,
[5473.54 --> 5473.92]  as if.
[5474.90 --> 5475.70]  Twinkies last forever.
[5475.70 --> 5476.98]  What form software are you going to use?
[5477.04 --> 5478.30]  We're going to use vBulletin,
[5478.48 --> 5479.98]  and moderators will be selected,
[5480.10 --> 5482.28]  will be handpicked by me and Slick,
[5482.64 --> 5484.40]  based on how helpful people are,
[5484.46 --> 5485.54]  how positive they are,
[5485.64 --> 5488.64]  as how regularly they're contributing to the community.
[5489.66 --> 5489.90]  And,
[5489.98 --> 5490.36]  yeah,
[5490.56 --> 5492.10]  we're not taking applications.
[5492.76 --> 5496.86]  We are going to look for the people that are really proactive about helping people.
[5497.94 --> 5499.02]  Higher memory on video cards,
[5499.22 --> 5499.50]  yes,
[5499.56 --> 5499.92]  it matters,
[5500.00 --> 5502.32]  but it doesn't help at all for higher refresh rates,
[5502.50 --> 5503.52]  or higher resolutions.
[5503.52 --> 5505.52]  You need more memory for higher resolutions.
[5505.98 --> 5506.18]  Yeah,
[5506.34 --> 5507.62]  and like multi-monitors and stuff.
[5508.42 --> 5509.98]  I will download an auto script.
[5510.22 --> 5510.54]  Excellent.
[5511.74 --> 5513.48]  I don't know if we're allowed saying that.
[5515.12 --> 5516.12]  For liking videos?
[5516.28 --> 5516.48]  Yeah.
[5516.58 --> 5517.58]  We can say there's a script.
[5517.80 --> 5518.14]  I don't know.
[5518.26 --> 5519.22]  We're not providing it to them.
[5519.24 --> 5520.08]  But you're encouraging.
[5520.26 --> 5520.66]  I don't know.
[5520.80 --> 5520.92]  Whatever.
[5520.92 --> 5524.48]  Linus Twinkie tips.
[5524.62 --> 5525.66]  Just changed my fan speed.
[5526.10 --> 5528.60]  I think donating money for likes and shares on your videos is a brilliant idea.
[5528.78 --> 5528.92]  Okay.
[5529.16 --> 5529.38]  Yeah.
[5529.54 --> 5529.72]  See,
[5529.88 --> 5531.16]  that's the attitude.
[5531.64 --> 5533.20]  Helping people for the click of a mouse.
[5533.56 --> 5534.80]  You guys should have to do nothing.
[5535.36 --> 5535.72]  Ultimately,
[5536.08 --> 5536.32]  yes,
[5536.44 --> 5538.32]  I will obtain more advertising revenue,
[5538.52 --> 5540.64]  and then a portion of that gets to go to help people.
[5540.98 --> 5541.16]  So,
[5541.24 --> 5542.28]  I think we all kind of win.
[5542.90 --> 5543.10]  Yeah,
[5543.18 --> 5544.28]  I think it's actually pretty awesome.
[5545.18 --> 5546.40]  Money idea seems good.
[5546.48 --> 5548.06]  Just feels like a lot of people have already done it.
[5548.28 --> 5548.68]  That's okay.
[5548.72 --> 5549.72]  We're going to do it regularly.
[5549.96 --> 5550.58]  And I don't think...
[5550.58 --> 5556.32]  I actually know of no one who does based on likes and does it consistently every month or quarter.
[5556.50 --> 5558.32]  The idea is we'll be doing it all the time.
[5558.72 --> 5558.92]  Yeah.
[5559.10 --> 5561.42]  It's supposed to be like a fairly big part of the...
[5561.42 --> 5562.28]  More of the forum,
[5562.50 --> 5562.88]  I think.
[5563.08 --> 5563.28]  Yeah.
[5563.70 --> 5568.18]  A big part of the community-driven aspect instead of like this random thing.
[5568.58 --> 5571.16]  Thoughts on Gangnam Style reaching 1 billion views.
[5571.36 --> 5571.72]  Incredible.
[5572.16 --> 5573.36]  That's just...
[5573.36 --> 5573.88]  Outstanding.
[5573.88 --> 5574.88]  Within like six months,
[5574.98 --> 5576.44]  it's the most viewed video on YouTube ever.
[5576.44 --> 5577.06]  That's insane.
[5577.24 --> 5578.16]  I don't even know...
[5578.16 --> 5580.02]  That's so much time spent watching a video.
[5580.24 --> 5580.58]  I mean,
[5580.66 --> 5583.88]  I would have thought something like Charlie Bit My Finger was like kind of untouchable.
[5584.40 --> 5586.02]  Just because it's like so legendary.
[5586.26 --> 5588.52]  It's like the first ultra viral video on YouTube,
[5588.74 --> 5589.88]  but...
[5589.88 --> 5591.16]  I was wrong.
[5591.90 --> 5592.90]  I've only watched it once.
[5594.16 --> 5596.64]  The first donation should go for some razors for slick.
[5596.84 --> 5597.20]  Very good.
[5597.68 --> 5598.72]  Money likes being good.
[5598.84 --> 5599.08]  Okay.
[5599.14 --> 5600.44]  Have you tried the program Flux?
[5600.86 --> 5601.16]  Yeah.
[5601.44 --> 5602.10]  Flux is awesome.
[5602.10 --> 5603.34]  I haven't tried it,
[5603.36 --> 5604.48]  but I've heard it's like outstanding.
[5604.66 --> 5604.96]  Awesome.
[5605.14 --> 5607.42]  Unless you're someone who's going to like edit photos or video.
[5607.72 --> 5608.90]  Best red switch keyboard.
[5610.28 --> 5613.98]  That's like asking us like which semi truck has the best mileage.
[5614.12 --> 5615.42]  It's like you could answer the question,
[5615.58 --> 5615.76]  but oh,
[5615.82 --> 5615.90]  well,
[5615.90 --> 5616.04]  no,
[5616.08 --> 5616.52]  that's valid.
[5616.62 --> 5616.90]  Hold on.
[5616.90 --> 5621.14]  It's like asking us which motorcycle has the greatest towing capacity.
[5623.02 --> 5623.62]  It's like,
[5623.78 --> 5624.86]  yeah,
[5624.98 --> 5627.12]  neither slick nor I are really Cherry MX red guys.
[5627.12 --> 5627.14]  Yeah,
[5627.22 --> 5628.64]  I was just going to preface that.
[5628.74 --> 5630.00]  Neither of us are fans of red.
[5630.50 --> 5632.88]  I actually don't know anyone who is,
[5632.98 --> 5633.52]  but like...
[5633.52 --> 5634.08]  You're...
[5634.08 --> 5635.90]  Why are you going to be like that?
[5635.98 --> 5637.52]  I'm sure there are people that are fans of them,
[5637.56 --> 5638.48]  and I would probably ask them.
[5638.48 --> 5638.92]  Yeah,
[5638.92 --> 5641.08]  I'm more of a brown black guy.
[5642.70 --> 5643.48]  I'm more of a blue.
[5643.48 --> 5644.26]  Although based on,
[5644.30 --> 5644.46]  you know,
[5644.50 --> 5645.28]  my choice of white,
[5645.36 --> 5646.66]  you'd think I'd like Cherry MX yellow.
[5649.70 --> 5650.06]  Okay,
[5650.16 --> 5650.64]  moving along.
[5652.48 --> 5654.66]  ITX versus MATX versus ATX.
[5654.76 --> 5655.74]  Size versus expansion.
[5656.60 --> 5657.20]  You know what?
[5657.20 --> 5658.68]  That's not a bad one for maybe next week.
[5658.88 --> 5659.64]  That's a topic.
[5660.00 --> 5660.24]  Yeah,
[5660.28 --> 5661.30]  that's like a whole topic.
[5661.48 --> 5661.64]  Yeah.
[5662.14 --> 5663.78]  Live stream on Twitch TV.
[5664.40 --> 5664.56]  Oh,
[5664.62 --> 5664.98]  now what?
[5665.00 --> 5665.14]  Oh,
[5665.14 --> 5665.36]  okay,
[5665.42 --> 5666.30]  he's just tweeting that he's...
[5666.30 --> 5666.44]  Oh,
[5666.56 --> 5666.96]  thank you.
[5668.10 --> 5669.00]  He's calling us out,
[5669.22 --> 5672.28]  or calling out that he does stuff that involves watching us.
[5672.70 --> 5674.82]  I think there's a super creative way to not grovel for likes.
[5674.90 --> 5675.06]  Yes,
[5675.14 --> 5676.20]  because grovels are stupid.
[5676.86 --> 5678.88]  I have no idea what the scripts do or don't do.
[5679.00 --> 5680.22]  I can't encourage you to use them,
[5680.30 --> 5680.58]  apparently,
[5680.72 --> 5681.96]  and I've never used them myself,
[5682.08 --> 5682.38]  so,
[5682.96 --> 5683.36]  sorry.
[5683.62 --> 5683.80]  Oh,
[5683.90 --> 5684.04]  well,
[5684.04 --> 5684.20]  there.
[5684.36 --> 5684.80]  There you go.
[5685.18 --> 5686.10]  I didn't give you this.
[5689.28 --> 5690.50]  Add a donation button.
[5690.92 --> 5691.44]  You know what?
[5691.56 --> 5693.76]  I'm actually not going to add a donation.
[5693.78 --> 5697.16]  I think that that gets very complicated.
[5697.52 --> 5705.54]  I would like for you guys to find ways to donate that are just liking the videos.
[5705.72 --> 5705.78]  And,
[5705.86 --> 5706.00]  like,
[5706.10 --> 5706.38]  honestly,
[5706.38 --> 5707.44]  if you guys want to donate,
[5707.54 --> 5709.30]  we don't want it to be through us.
[5709.38 --> 5709.54]  Yeah,
[5709.58 --> 5710.96]  you can donate to whatever you want.
[5710.96 --> 5712.16]  We want to have our own pool of money.
[5712.36 --> 5712.78]  That's great.
[5713.10 --> 5715.28]  The accounting gets very complicated,
[5715.42 --> 5715.68]  I think.
[5715.78 --> 5715.96]  Yeah,
[5716.04 --> 5716.24]  yeah,
[5716.30 --> 5716.46]  and,
[5716.56 --> 5716.62]  like,
[5716.64 --> 5717.50]  if you guys want to set up,
[5717.56 --> 5717.68]  like,
[5717.72 --> 5718.88]  I've heard of donation teams.
[5719.42 --> 5719.60]  Like,
[5719.60 --> 5721.04]  there's an OCN group.
[5721.16 --> 5721.24]  Like,
[5721.28 --> 5723.28]  if you guys want to make your own little thing on the forum,
[5723.28 --> 5723.44]  like,
[5723.50 --> 5723.96]  that's awesome.
[5724.16 --> 5724.18]  Like,
[5724.18 --> 5724.62]  that's cool.
[5725.02 --> 5725.18]  But,
[5725.30 --> 5725.94]  just run it,
[5726.12 --> 5726.28]  like,
[5726.36 --> 5728.94]  we don't want to have the accounting stuff on our end,
[5728.98 --> 5730.68]  and we don't want to have the liability on our end.
[5730.70 --> 5730.86]  So,
[5731.04 --> 5733.16]  encourage other people to like our videos,
[5733.26 --> 5736.66]  and you'll be inherently donating to us.
[5736.80 --> 5737.92]  And it won't even cost you anything,
[5738.00 --> 5738.42]  which is great.
[5738.58 --> 5738.74]  Yeah.
[5738.74 --> 5739.78]  And we,
[5739.88 --> 5740.10]  I mean,
[5740.16 --> 5743.38]  we may take donations for the forum in the form of,
[5743.46 --> 5743.54]  like,
[5743.56 --> 5745.74]  a paid account that gives you a special avatar or something.
[5746.20 --> 5746.48]  But,
[5746.64 --> 5747.28]  for that,
[5747.42 --> 5748.60]  we'd be looking at,
[5748.70 --> 5749.00]  sort of,
[5749.04 --> 5751.50]  how much we need to keep the forum running.
[5751.58 --> 5751.90]  And that would be-
[5751.90 --> 5752.78]  Not as a profit center.
[5752.90 --> 5753.02]  Yeah.
[5753.02 --> 5754.16]  And not as a charity thing.
[5754.26 --> 5754.36]  Like,
[5754.42 --> 5754.68]  just,
[5755.16 --> 5756.70]  that would be more like donating to the forum.
[5756.84 --> 5757.00]  Yeah,
[5757.04 --> 5758.28]  that wouldn't be to the charity at all.
[5758.34 --> 5758.52]  Yeah.
[5759.96 --> 5760.28]  Okay.
[5760.28 --> 5762.50]  THQ gone and bought by Ubisoft?
[5763.22 --> 5764.02]  Have you heard about this?
[5764.28 --> 5764.56]  Yes.
[5764.78 --> 5765.80]  I didn't know it was Ubisoft,
[5765.96 --> 5767.16]  but I knew they filed out for bankruptcy,
[5767.34 --> 5769.72]  and I knew there's a very high profile name that was buying them.
[5771.18 --> 5772.18]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[5772.90 --> 5773.14]  Yeah.
[5773.30 --> 5774.22]  Like the donations idea?
[5774.66 --> 5774.98]  Cool.
[5775.60 --> 5775.92]  Yes.
[5776.04 --> 5776.78]  Please do.
[5776.90 --> 5777.60]  Spam the likes.
[5777.72 --> 5778.06]  Thank you,
[5778.10 --> 5778.34]  Brian.
[5778.66 --> 5778.94]  I mean,
[5778.96 --> 5781.20]  if everyone who's watching this live stream right now,
[5781.26 --> 5783.46]  which is 2,200 of you,
[5783.84 --> 5787.02]  if every one of you guys just take two seconds and like every video,
[5787.16 --> 5788.98]  that will make a huge difference for me personally.
[5788.98 --> 5791.10]  Like it actually does.
[5791.16 --> 5791.66]  It shouldn't.
[5791.92 --> 5792.80]  And I kind of hate it.
[5793.12 --> 5793.86]  Like I really do.
[5793.96 --> 5795.78]  Like I think about this guys.
[5795.86 --> 5798.94]  I've gone five years without soliciting likes.
[5799.12 --> 5799.78]  I hate it.
[5799.84 --> 5800.56]  I think it's stupid.
[5800.76 --> 5801.62]  It's actually a big deal.
[5801.70 --> 5802.64]  Ever since I joined on,
[5802.72 --> 5805.00]  he's commented about how he doesn't like asking for likes.
[5805.20 --> 5805.44]  So this,
[5805.60 --> 5805.80]  yeah.
[5806.38 --> 5806.64]  Yeah.
[5807.60 --> 5808.72]  Enjoying the stream.
[5808.90 --> 5810.58]  Linus will be using V bulletin,
[5810.74 --> 5813.12]  downloading an auto like plugin as we speak.
[5813.34 --> 5813.58]  Thanks,
[5813.66 --> 5813.82]  bro.
[5814.56 --> 5815.72]  The idea is great.
[5815.84 --> 5816.56]  And the sooner you guys start,
[5816.64 --> 5817.80]  the sooner we'll support you in every way.
[5817.80 --> 5818.10]  Cool.
[5818.10 --> 5821.04]  And we'll get it going as soon as we like get our stuff together.
[5821.16 --> 5822.34]  We've got CES coming up.
[5822.40 --> 5823.80]  We've both got family stuff for Christmas.
[5824.20 --> 5826.36]  So yeah,
[5827.04 --> 5827.82]  good suggestion.
[5828.38 --> 5828.56]  Okay.
[5828.66 --> 5829.82]  Community involvement is always great.
[5829.92 --> 5832.54]  So it sounds like you guys are totally supportive.
[5833.28 --> 5834.06]  And this,
[5834.24 --> 5834.58]  Alex,
[5834.84 --> 5835.62]  great point.
[5835.88 --> 5836.84]  I think it's a good idea,
[5836.92 --> 5838.80]  but I don't know how many people will hear about it,
[5838.98 --> 5839.80]  but I like the idea.
[5840.04 --> 5840.38]  Alex,
[5840.38 --> 5845.40]  I'm putting you personally in charge of being every single person watching.
[5845.40 --> 5848.42]  You guys are all personally responsible for helping us with this.
[5848.84 --> 5849.44]  Like I said,
[5849.56 --> 5853.70]  I want the top comment on every video to be about this program,
[5854.08 --> 5859.22]  about how liking Linus Tech Tips videos is going to help support this cause with some kind of,
[5859.28 --> 5859.48]  you know,
[5859.52 --> 5862.40]  a link to the forum thread where we're discussing the one for this month.
[5862.40 --> 5866.06]  Like I want you guys to get involved in a way that doesn't cost anything,
[5866.06 --> 5867.02]  but really helps us,
[5867.16 --> 5867.94]  helps out everybody.
[5868.38 --> 5870.92]  So that means if one person comments about it,
[5870.94 --> 5873.20]  you guys all need to glom on and like that comment,
[5873.52 --> 5874.82]  help boost it up to the top,
[5874.90 --> 5878.10]  help get this ball going so that I don't have to plead for likes.
[5878.32 --> 5880.60]  I'm pleading with you now once.
[5881.52 --> 5884.06]  And other than announcing the program on a video on YouTube,
[5884.20 --> 5885.04]  which I'll probably do,
[5885.20 --> 5886.76]  this will be the one time I'm going to do it.
[5886.84 --> 5888.36]  I want you guys to spearhead this.
[5890.90 --> 5891.30]  Okay.
[5892.40 --> 5893.40]  Okay.
[5894.30 --> 5896.08]  I think that's pretty much it for this week.
[5896.32 --> 5896.54]  Yeah.
[5898.94 --> 5899.84]  Thank you for,
[5899.84 --> 5901.42]  for joining us,
[5901.46 --> 5903.08]  even though I know you're like super sick.
[5903.52 --> 5904.90]  I'm going to go home and go to sleep.
[5905.10 --> 5905.36]  Yeah.
[5905.56 --> 5906.06]  Sort of.
[5906.14 --> 5907.00]  Do you want another Twinkie?
[5907.42 --> 5907.74]  No.
[5910.12 --> 5910.58]  All right,
[5910.60 --> 5910.84]  guys.
[5910.92 --> 5911.86]  Thank you for watching.
[5912.02 --> 5912.36]  And yeah,
[5912.46 --> 5917.64]  I super thank you for watching because I think this is one of our highest viewer numbers that we've ever had on the live show.
[5917.76 --> 5918.32]  So yeah,
[5918.34 --> 5920.96]  thank you so much guys for tuning in and good night.
[5921.06 --> 5921.56]  Merry Christmas.
[5921.56 --> 5922.40]  Merry Christmas.
[5922.40 --> 5922.42]  Merry Christmas.
[5922.56 --> 5923.58]  And happy Hanukkah.
[5923.80 --> 5925.18]  And just everything.
[5925.34 --> 5926.74]  Generally sort of,
[5926.84 --> 5927.10]  you know,
[5927.62 --> 5930.14]  happy winter solstice time.
[5931.36 --> 5932.66]  I have to turn this off somehow.
[5932.98 --> 5933.62]  It's way over there.
[5934.18 --> 5934.96]  It's hard to see.
[5935.10 --> 5936.04]  See if I can do it from here.
[5938.26 --> 5939.14]  Wait for it.
[5939.14 --> 5939.64]  Oh,
[5939.64 --> 5940.46]  Oh.
