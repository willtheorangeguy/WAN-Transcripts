[0.00 --> 9.36]  Oh, one minute early. Holy cow, it's almost like we have taken organizational pills.
[10.24 --> 14.66]  And, uh, I don't know where Slick's going. He's apparently totally drunk.
[14.76 --> 20.48]  Oh, no, don't, don't. Oh, wait, white balance. You can do that. Okay, good. Do the thing.
[21.84 --> 23.96]  They're all going to be like, what?
[23.96 --> 31.10]  What? Tune in for Tech Chat. One and a half hours of a white piece of paper. Ooh. Okay, that's worse.
[31.84 --> 33.40]  Is that worse? Yeah, don't worry about it. It's okay.
[36.14 --> 39.76]  Give me a sec. Ah, it's all right. Are we on? Yeah, we're on.
[41.04 --> 44.90]  Hi. Hi, everybody. They can't hear you. You're behind the shotgun mic.
[45.46 --> 49.04]  Uh, we went up when I talked. Yeah, I don't know. Hello, hello, hello. They can definitely hear me.
[49.04 --> 52.98]  Yeah, they can hear you. I know. You know what? Why don't I go make sure the stream's actually working this week?
[52.98 --> 59.24]  For those of you who joined us last week, you'll remember this. For those of you who didn't, this will be a pretty hilarious story.
[59.76 --> 71.20]  Uh, last week we actually talked for about half an hour before we realized that, um, our, our broadcast was not actually on.
[71.62 --> 79.98]  So, this week we are going through the, uh, the precautionary measure, that is, to actually check that we are indeed broadcasting.
[79.98 --> 90.40]  Broadcasting. Because, uh, XSplits being a tool, and, um, uh, oh, our Blackmagic Intensity Pro cards are being tools.
[91.16 --> 98.46]  And, yet again. Um, so yeah, we're, like, done with these. Does anyone want to buy a pair of Blackmagic Intensity Pro capture cards?
[98.46 --> 102.42]  Yes. HDMI capture. Uh, does analog capture as well.
[102.50 --> 104.20]  Don't we still need it for dual camera unboxings?
[105.04 --> 106.22]  No, we don't even use it.
[107.32 --> 108.84]  Right, we just go on SD cards now.
[108.84 --> 115.54]  Yep, let's, let's do a quick discussion of, uh, the new system that is going to be used for unboxings.
[115.60 --> 118.76]  Actually, I think I uploaded the last of the ones with the Gibbled audio.
[119.56 --> 125.38]  And, uh, we are, we are no longer, okay, what we were trying to do was we were trying to use XSplit as a capture.
[125.56 --> 127.20]  So, we were doing what's called Live2Tape.
[127.20 --> 136.84]  So, we had two cameras, and then I was using a switcher to switch, actually, yeah, I was using this exact switcher to switch between scenes in XSplit as we went.
[137.24 --> 144.44]  So, I'd go, blah, blah, blah, something up close, click, and I was like, oh, this is so cool, now we can switch to the close-up camera, that's awesome.
[144.66 --> 149.06]  You know what, it's the stupidest thing ever, because, I mean, okay, XSplit has other advantages.
[149.06 --> 156.62]  Like, we were able to use it to make slight corrections to the color between the two cameras to make sure that they both look as close as possible.
[157.20 --> 158.12]  So, that was cool.
[159.30 --> 162.60]  But the problem is that XSplit does a couple of things.
[162.70 --> 167.64]  Number one, it outputs FLV files, which are ridiculous, because nothing works with them.
[168.08 --> 171.72]  Number two, is it outputs a variable frame rate.
[172.62 --> 173.96]  You hear that, XSplit developers?
[174.48 --> 175.12]  No.
[176.56 --> 177.28]  Bad.
[178.98 --> 179.50]  No.
[180.76 --> 183.94]  So, variable frame rate does a couple of really cool things.
[183.94 --> 191.60]  Number one, is it just has a hissy fit, if you import it into certain video editing programs.
[192.12 --> 198.66]  Even to do something as simple as cut out, slick uttering a swear word in the middle of me trying to film an unboxing.
[199.22 --> 199.86]  What? Really?
[199.94 --> 200.40]  No, I'm not.
[200.84 --> 202.60]  Oh, okay. I was like, when was that?
[203.64 --> 205.88]  So, if you want to cut something out, big problem.
[206.00 --> 207.80]  You want to do anything, big problem.
[207.80 --> 210.54]  Number two, is the audio desyncs.
[210.94 --> 216.66]  Because, like, there was one that I uploaded three times, and I think the viewers were super mad.
[216.76 --> 216.94]  Yeah.
[217.02 --> 220.14]  Because they were like, woo, they can't even fix audio synch...
[220.14 --> 220.74]  You know what?
[220.74 --> 226.88]  I can't fix the audio synchronization when it re-desyncs every, like, half a minute of footage.
[226.88 --> 229.40]  So, I was just like, okay, this is the best I can do.
[229.48 --> 230.48]  I uploaded it, and that was it.
[230.52 --> 231.28]  That was all I could do.
[232.28 --> 232.70]  So, that's...
[232.70 --> 237.70]  I'm like, to even edit really, really, really simple things, we'd have to transcode it.
[238.04 --> 239.48]  Which is just like, why?
[239.68 --> 240.66]  It takes a long time.
[240.88 --> 241.84]  It takes a long time.
[241.94 --> 242.56]  It lowers the quality.
[242.56 --> 245.62]  It runs your computer, lowers the quality, and it's just like, why did I have to do that?
[246.32 --> 256.22]  So, anyway, the new system is we just do a dual cam setup where both of the people are assuming that they're recording...
[256.22 --> 258.92]  Oh, oh, XSplit also borked our audio.
[259.38 --> 264.70]  Because we couldn't monitor the audio properly because of the way that XSplit works,
[265.14 --> 271.26]  which meant that we got out clipping in, like, eight unboxings that we filmed all at the same time.
[271.26 --> 274.84]  And the magic of unboxings is we don't get to re-unbox stuff.
[275.58 --> 277.40]  Like, once it's done, it's done.
[277.52 --> 277.88]  What you got?
[278.98 --> 279.60]  Oh, yeah.
[279.92 --> 280.34]  Oh, yeah.
[280.60 --> 283.26]  The other thing, and this was kind of our bad, is...
[283.78 --> 284.94]  Wait, well, no, this was okay.
[285.32 --> 285.94]  These are fixed in.
[285.94 --> 289.04]  I'm explaining how we sync the audio now in the new videos.
[289.28 --> 289.98]  Oh, right.
[290.08 --> 294.08]  So, with two cameras, how do you make sure that the AV sync is correct?
[294.22 --> 299.26]  So, Slick, go ahead and explain this high-technology device that they've probably never heard of before.
[300.40 --> 301.18]  Well, I don't know.
[301.26 --> 301.80]  Let's hope you're going on.
[301.82 --> 302.38]  I'm just trolling.
[302.46 --> 305.56]  At the beginning of the video, both the cameras start rolling at different times.
[305.68 --> 305.84]  Right.
[305.92 --> 307.20]  Oh, I didn't even explain yet.
[307.60 --> 308.92]  So, we're just recording to SD.
[309.72 --> 309.94]  Yeah.
[309.94 --> 314.50]  And then we drop it in Premiere, and you can just switch between cameras that way, rather
[314.50 --> 316.50]  than trying to do a live-to-tape thing.
[316.58 --> 321.50]  Because then, whoever's editing it can just make decisions about which camera to go to.
[321.80 --> 322.68]  So, audio sync.
[322.68 --> 328.22]  I'll explain the really cool thing in Premiere that you were trying to explain in more depth
[328.22 --> 328.64]  in a second.
[329.04 --> 333.06]  But at the beginning, we don't exactly start recording at the same time, Diesel and I.
[333.50 --> 336.02]  So, line-ups will go like this.
[336.24 --> 339.36]  I'm not going to actually let it drop because I don't know how loud that's going to come
[339.36 --> 339.54]  through.
[339.54 --> 343.24]  But it makes a really loud clicking noise, and everyone goes quiet before and after
[343.24 --> 343.44]  it.
[343.80 --> 347.86]  So, when the editor goes in, you can line up that instead of just trying to eyeball the
[347.86 --> 348.16]  shots.
[348.16 --> 350.44]  Because if you just try and eyeball the shots, it'll never be perfect.
[350.54 --> 351.38]  And that was the problem.
[351.50 --> 357.20]  We were trying to fix audio sync issues without any reference point, and with a variable frame
[357.20 --> 360.20]  rate that varied depending.
[360.42 --> 364.56]  Like, when you dropped it into Premiere, like, Vegas just freaked when you tried to put the
[364.56 --> 365.02]  footage in it.
[365.10 --> 365.96]  It just wouldn't accept it.
[365.96 --> 370.44]  And then Premiere would average out the frame rate of the entire clips.
[370.58 --> 374.18]  You'd get a file that's 28.53 FPS.
[374.92 --> 376.26]  And you're just like, huh?
[376.34 --> 376.70]  What?
[377.22 --> 377.50]  What?
[377.98 --> 379.62]  So, we go and check our XSplit settings.
[379.72 --> 380.64]  We're like, what?
[383.12 --> 384.44]  What is this foodie magic?
[384.56 --> 385.22]  Anyways, yeah.
[385.28 --> 385.72]  We're learning.
[386.30 --> 391.28]  Diesel is showing me, and I still am getting used to Premiere because I'm used to, like,
[391.50 --> 392.34]  new level Vegas.
[392.34 --> 397.62]  But, um, Diesel is showing me this thing where you input both the video files, and then there's
[397.62 --> 399.50]  a window on the right that'll show you both playing.
[399.62 --> 401.82]  And then there's a red box around whatever one you have selected.
[402.20 --> 405.54]  And you just bind one camera to one and the other camera to two.
[405.62 --> 407.28]  And whenever you want to switch, you just do it on your keyboard.
[407.28 --> 412.64]  So, it's what he had to do live, but no longer live and from a third-person view.
[413.02 --> 415.36]  So, it's super easy and way more clean.
[415.84 --> 416.82]  And the color correction.
[416.94 --> 421.50]  We've actually got the cameras tuned pretty close now, whereas we were having a lot of
[421.50 --> 423.44]  trouble getting the colors right.
[423.76 --> 428.84]  I don't know if you guys remember back when we did the, um, Tokyo Flash Japan watch.
[428.84 --> 434.50]  That was the first time we used the FS700 as an A cam and the XA10 as a B cam, which was
[434.50 --> 439.46]  the wrong approach anyway, because the XA10 should be the lock shot, and the FS700 should
[439.46 --> 441.10]  be the up-close one, because it's so gorgeous.
[441.88 --> 444.18]  And, um, something, something, keep going.
[444.28 --> 444.80]  I have a phone call.
[445.90 --> 446.42]  Uh...
[446.42 --> 448.72]  Yes, you are live on the Linus Tech Tips show.
[452.82 --> 453.26]  Hello?
[457.60 --> 458.66]  That was anticlimactic.
[458.68 --> 458.92]  Hello?
[460.06 --> 461.88]  That is continuously anticlimactic.
[462.80 --> 464.50]  You're watching and you're drunk.
[465.30 --> 466.24]  Who is this?
[466.38 --> 467.34]  Yeah, seriously, who is this?
[471.14 --> 472.06]  You're in Iowa.
[472.48 --> 475.20]  All right, well, apparently we have our very first live caller.
[475.36 --> 476.34]  So, hold on, hold on just a minute.
[476.42 --> 482.28]  All right, sorry, um, wait, I'm just going to turn off my speakerphone here.
[482.60 --> 483.84]  Okay, can I get your name, sir?
[487.72 --> 488.42]  I'm sorry?
[492.42 --> 493.52]  Who is this?
[493.66 --> 494.16]  I don't know.
[494.78 --> 496.14]  Do you have a tech question?
[496.14 --> 507.06]  I think he's very, very intoxicated.
[507.12 --> 508.56]  I think he is quite intoxicated.
[508.78 --> 509.64]  Okay, you know what, sir?
[509.90 --> 513.66]  We're going to have to try this again sometime when you're feeling a little bit more up to
[513.66 --> 513.82]  it.
[513.94 --> 516.72]  But, uh, thank, thank, thank you for calling in to Linus Tech Tips.
[517.68 --> 520.82]  So, to be clear, guys, this is not a sports talk radio show.
[520.98 --> 524.68]  And if you call into a show, it's kind of a known thing that you don't listen to the
[524.68 --> 525.20]  show anymore.
[525.38 --> 527.56]  Because it's obviously going to be at different times.
[528.06 --> 529.76]  So, you kind of need to focus on the call.
[529.76 --> 533.12]  So, let everyone watching the show can actually understand what you're trying to say.
[533.12 --> 538.94]  So, I think what happened is he was one of the, uh, 140 or so viewers who caught a video
[538.94 --> 541.22]  that I uploaded that had my phone number in it.
[541.62 --> 545.70]  So, um, I'd appreciate if you guys don't call that number.
[545.80 --> 546.74]  It is my cell phone.
[546.80 --> 548.40]  I do get billed for those calls.
[548.60 --> 550.16]  So, uh, there you go.
[550.22 --> 554.84]  But why don't we dive into some Twitter questions, having gone through that random experience.
[554.84 --> 557.72]  And here we go.
[557.92 --> 559.22]  37 new interactions.
[560.26 --> 562.80]  TechX says, I am lucky I was able to catch this.
[562.88 --> 564.56]  I've been trying to get Windows to work since yesterday.
[564.70 --> 566.42]  Finally fixed it two minutes ago.
[566.84 --> 567.36]  All right.
[568.06 --> 571.52]  Rapid storage technology actually is a bit of a nightmare to deal with sometimes.
[571.52 --> 575.00]  Because you install it once and then everything seems to work.
[575.40 --> 578.96]  And then if you change anything and reboot, it's just like, bleh.
[579.46 --> 579.76]  Nope.
[579.98 --> 580.86]  I don't want to do anything.
[580.86 --> 581.22]  Bleh.
[582.46 --> 583.14]  I quit.
[583.14 --> 587.88]  Yeah, and it just, it can be quite, when it's working, it's great.
[588.26 --> 589.98]  Because everything just kind of works.
[590.06 --> 593.42]  You can hot plug everything and, what do you want about?
[593.68 --> 594.46]  Who wants Twitter stuff?
[594.54 --> 595.16]  All right, all right, all right.
[595.60 --> 599.28]  I spent three hours watching cat videos while waiting for midnight.
[599.28 --> 602.14]  And did you know Crazy Russian is good at dancing?
[602.56 --> 604.54]  The Crazy Russian is excellent at dancing.
[604.66 --> 607.56]  We're all going to visit his YouTube channel together.
[607.94 --> 608.86]  I've never seen this.
[608.92 --> 610.12]  You haven't seen this?
[610.28 --> 611.84]  I always forget to go look.
[612.32 --> 612.96]  Oh, crap.
[613.14 --> 616.84]  Um, B-SOD, I believe.
[617.98 --> 618.62]  B-SOD.
[619.08 --> 620.76]  Uh, hold on, hold on, guys.
[620.82 --> 621.72]  I'm working on this.
[621.78 --> 623.18]  I'm genuinely working on this.
[623.22 --> 624.04]  Maybe just do a search.
[624.08 --> 625.36]  I think it's B-SOD.
[626.24 --> 627.76]  Oh, I spelled dash wrong.
[627.82 --> 628.24]  No, it's okay.
[628.30 --> 628.54]  It's okay.
[628.60 --> 629.00]  Calm down.
[629.14 --> 629.48]  Calm down.
[629.98 --> 630.38]  Bleh.
[633.20 --> 633.84]  There he is.
[633.84 --> 634.58]  Oh, yeah.
[634.58 --> 635.48]  Here we go.
[635.48 --> 635.98]  All right.
[636.28 --> 642.68]  So this is the YouTube channel of the one and only Crazy Russian.
[642.92 --> 643.60]  There's music.
[643.70 --> 645.00]  You'll just have to trust me on this.
[645.12 --> 648.76]  But this is the Russian doing his thing.
[648.76 --> 649.76]  Oh.
[657.66 --> 658.14]  And...
[658.14 --> 658.82]  Okay.
[660.26 --> 661.00]  Here he goes.
[661.10 --> 661.52]  There we go.
[661.56 --> 662.62]  He's doing his thing again.
[662.62 --> 669.32]  He has music actually playing, but I'm going to be the music.
[669.38 --> 669.76]  You want to help me?
[677.54 --> 678.48]  Look at these guys.
[678.48 --> 683.46]  Oh, Russian.
[683.80 --> 685.28]  How I do adore thee.
[687.00 --> 691.10]  So anyway, that is the Crazy Russian's YouTube channel.
[691.58 --> 692.74]  B-SOD.
[693.20 --> 695.70]  B-SOD on the YouTubes.
[695.96 --> 696.66]  East side.
[697.08 --> 698.08]  Or maybe he's west side.
[698.12 --> 698.48]  I don't know.
[699.10 --> 701.68]  But anyway, we love the Russian very dearly.
[701.98 --> 703.02]  So go visit his channel.
[703.16 --> 704.04]  Comment on his videos.
[704.22 --> 706.40]  Tell him Linus sent you and that you enjoy his dancing.
[706.40 --> 708.70]  Zachary asks,
[708.80 --> 709.96]  Best use for home server?
[710.20 --> 712.04]  I use mine to store my data
[712.04 --> 715.64]  and to stream transcoded videos to my portable devices.
[716.08 --> 718.74]  In fact, I mentioned this in my last I Switched video
[718.74 --> 723.02]  where I'm doing my 30 days of Windows Phone 8,
[723.62 --> 724.56]  which is okay.
[724.72 --> 725.16]  Postpone.
[725.26 --> 727.06]  My update is ready to be installed, evidently.
[727.92 --> 728.76]  One sec.
[728.86 --> 729.40]  What are you on about?
[729.60 --> 730.38]  Reading a comment.
[731.08 --> 731.88]  This is public.
[733.44 --> 733.68]  Huh?
[734.10 --> 734.78]  Someone said,
[734.78 --> 736.62]  make sure you post a video saying it's live.
[736.74 --> 739.36]  Oh, it's possible that it was still publishing to everyone.
[740.20 --> 741.36]  What was I talking about?
[741.48 --> 741.78]  Oh, right.
[741.84 --> 741.96]  Yeah.
[742.02 --> 744.52]  So I found a substitute for Air Video,
[744.86 --> 747.48]  which is called a cloud with a Q.
[747.82 --> 749.84]  So you can go to your server
[749.84 --> 751.92]  and then you can, you know,
[751.96 --> 753.04]  go to your videos
[753.04 --> 754.88]  and you can browse your videos.
[755.08 --> 756.08]  So what happens is
[756.08 --> 758.62]  my home server uses its CPU power
[758.62 --> 760.06]  to transcode the video
[760.06 --> 761.06]  into something,
[761.54 --> 762.00]  um,
[762.96 --> 763.66]  something,
[763.78 --> 764.20]  uh,
[764.20 --> 764.60]  smaller
[764.60 --> 766.26]  so that it's easy to beam to you,
[766.30 --> 767.44]  whether it's over regular,
[767.44 --> 767.94]  uh,
[767.94 --> 768.36]  Wi-Fi
[768.36 --> 769.80]  or over your cellular data.
[770.64 --> 771.00]  Okay,
[771.12 --> 772.02]  looking to upgrade
[772.02 --> 773.90]  from a 6770.
[774.12 --> 776.78]  Would a 669 Ti max things out at 720p?
[777.58 --> 777.98]  Yes.
[778.68 --> 780.08]  Did you really just shrug?
[780.34 --> 782.76]  A 660 at 720p?
[782.84 --> 784.14]  Why is he running 720p?
[784.84 --> 785.20]  Yeah,
[785.26 --> 786.70]  why are you running 720p?
[786.72 --> 787.40]  That's my shrug.
[788.64 --> 789.48]  Upgrade your monitor.
[790.16 --> 790.34]  No,
[790.40 --> 792.28]  it's possible he has an older HDTV
[792.28 --> 794.34]  and maybe it's a media PC.
[795.30 --> 795.66]  Sir,
[795.86 --> 796.88]  post this on the forum.
[797.18 --> 797.84]  This is more interesting.
[797.84 --> 797.98]  Yeah,
[798.08 --> 799.92]  post it on the Linus Tech Tips forum.
[800.08 --> 801.02]  We need more details.
[801.42 --> 801.58]  Yeah,
[801.62 --> 802.32]  we need more details.
[802.82 --> 803.62]  Vid is choppy.
[803.72 --> 804.30]  I know,
[804.52 --> 804.92]  uh,
[805.04 --> 805.30]  we,
[805.58 --> 805.96]  yeah,
[806.02 --> 807.16]  we can kind of see it.
[807.56 --> 807.76]  Like,
[807.80 --> 808.54]  there's a little bit of
[808.54 --> 809.62]  choptasticness to it.
[809.68 --> 809.94]  Honestly,
[810.00 --> 810.68]  I don't think there's anything
[810.68 --> 811.42]  we can do about it
[811.42 --> 812.40]  because the black magic
[812.40 --> 813.98]  was just causing outright crashes,
[813.98 --> 814.30]  so.
[814.46 --> 815.62]  We've dropped 71 frames.
[815.74 --> 816.52]  I've never even seen that before.
[816.62 --> 816.86]  Yeah,
[817.08 --> 818.02]  we're dropping frames.
[818.14 --> 818.40]  I don't know,
[818.42 --> 818.80]  it's bizarre.
[819.52 --> 819.96]  Um,
[820.86 --> 821.28]  sorry,
[821.38 --> 822.34]  we don't really do,
[822.34 --> 822.62]  like,
[822.72 --> 823.58]  autographs,
[823.58 --> 824.08]  um,
[824.56 --> 825.74]  just because we're actually
[825.74 --> 826.48]  not that cool.
[827.04 --> 827.34]  I mean,
[827.34 --> 829.08]  you can send something to Slick
[829.08 --> 830.38]  and he can autograph it for you.
[831.16 --> 831.60]  Slick,
[831.76 --> 832.12]  actually,
[832.24 --> 832.32]  here,
[832.40 --> 832.64]  can you,
[832.80 --> 833.22]  here,
[833.54 --> 833.80]  Slick,
[834.24 --> 835.80]  can you autograph my case for me?
[835.80 --> 837.92]  I would never touch that case
[837.92 --> 838.78]  with anything
[838.78 --> 840.06]  that would make a mark on it.
[840.84 --> 841.08]  So,
[841.16 --> 841.50]  guys,
[841.60 --> 844.72]  my TJ07 has arrived.
[845.16 --> 846.86]  I'm actually not done
[846.86 --> 848.36]  putting it back together yet,
[848.72 --> 849.06]  but,
[849.16 --> 849.30]  uh,
[849.30 --> 849.54]  you know,
[849.62 --> 850.64]  do you want to go operate the camera?
[850.70 --> 850.84]  Yeah,
[850.84 --> 851.64]  they can't see the wrinkle.
[851.78 --> 851.96]  Yeah,
[852.02 --> 853.36]  they can't see the black wrinkle finish,
[853.48 --> 853.66]  so,
[853.94 --> 854.08]  here,
[854.14 --> 855.66]  we're going to do a bit of a segment here
[855.66 --> 856.10]  where
[856.10 --> 857.36]  I'm,
[857.36 --> 857.64]  uh,
[857.64 --> 858.66]  going to talk about
[858.66 --> 860.48]  my black wrinkle coated TJ07.
[860.66 --> 860.80]  Okay,
[860.88 --> 862.62]  so the first thing I'd like to address
[862.62 --> 863.66]  is,
[863.80 --> 865.16]  people have asked me,
[865.44 --> 867.02]  why would you strip
[867.02 --> 868.62]  and repaint your TJ07
[868.62 --> 870.32]  instead of just buying a new case?
[870.36 --> 870.52]  Okay,
[870.58 --> 871.28]  so a couple reasons.
[871.74 --> 872.34]  Number one
[872.34 --> 874.28]  is that the TJ07's my favorite case,
[874.32 --> 875.58]  and my wife gave me this one,
[875.58 --> 876.14]  uh,
[876.14 --> 876.96]  back when we were dating.
[877.62 --> 877.98]  Uh,
[877.98 --> 878.66]  number two
[878.66 --> 879.42]  is that,
[879.56 --> 880.72]  think about the cost.
[880.72 --> 882.26]  So I spent $250
[882.26 --> 883.48]  powder coating it.
[883.58 --> 884.80]  I spent about $150
[884.80 --> 886.12]  or $100 and something,
[886.60 --> 886.86]  uh,
[886.94 --> 887.68]  stripping it
[887.68 --> 888.96]  in the first place
[888.96 --> 889.84]  to get it powder coated.
[890.44 --> 891.24]  And so,
[891.44 --> 891.96]  people are like,
[892.00 --> 892.14]  oh,
[892.20 --> 892.32]  well,
[892.32 --> 893.26]  it's so much work
[893.26 --> 894.50]  and you could just buy a new case.
[894.54 --> 894.78]  And I'm like,
[894.84 --> 895.02]  okay,
[895.10 --> 895.34]  yes,
[895.36 --> 896.22]  it's so much work,
[896.36 --> 897.68]  but a new TJ07
[897.68 --> 899.20]  costs around $350
[899.20 --> 901.08]  plus then I'd have to
[901.08 --> 901.96]  powder coat it.
[902.40 --> 902.78]  Now,
[902.86 --> 903.86]  we're looking at
[903.86 --> 904.70]  $600,
[905.16 --> 906.10]  whereas I spent
[906.10 --> 906.90]  $450
[906.90 --> 907.46]  or $500.
[907.46 --> 908.82]  So there,
[909.24 --> 909.98]  that's one reason.
[910.12 --> 910.40]  Also,
[910.50 --> 910.98]  people are like,
[911.04 --> 911.18]  oh,
[911.24 --> 911.96]  all the modifications
[911.96 --> 912.96]  you have to do to this case,
[913.04 --> 914.26]  like cable management holes
[914.26 --> 915.32]  and,
[915.44 --> 915.66]  well,
[915.74 --> 917.16]  mostly the cable management holes,
[917.58 --> 918.44]  you wouldn't have to do that
[918.44 --> 919.12]  on a newer case.
[919.16 --> 919.50]  And I'm like,
[919.54 --> 919.64]  well,
[919.68 --> 919.82]  yeah,
[919.86 --> 921.22]  but I don't like a newer case
[921.22 --> 922.02]  as much as I like
[922.02 --> 923.20]  the TJ07.
[923.76 --> 924.42]  And so,
[924.56 --> 925.88]  if I bought another TJ07,
[925.88 --> 927.00]  I would just have to do
[927.00 --> 928.26]  all those cable management holes
[928.26 --> 929.12]  and stuff like that
[929.12 --> 929.60]  anyway.
[930.18 --> 930.46]  So,
[930.60 --> 931.52]  that is why I decided
[931.52 --> 932.10]  to go this route.
[932.20 --> 932.36]  Okay,
[932.72 --> 933.56]  so let's have a look
[933.56 --> 934.16]  at the finish.
[934.58 --> 934.80]  Uh,
[934.80 --> 935.74]  Mountain Mods did make
[935.74 --> 936.80]  a couple small mistakes,
[936.80 --> 937.72]  but overall,
[937.90 --> 938.58]  I'm still pleased
[938.58 --> 939.12]  with the results.
[939.24 --> 939.98]  So you want to zoom in,
[940.18 --> 940.54]  have a look.
[941.20 --> 942.90]  So this is
[942.90 --> 944.32]  Le Black Wrinkle
[944.32 --> 945.42]  and Slick's working
[945.42 --> 946.04]  on the focus
[946.04 --> 946.76]  so that you guys
[946.76 --> 947.46]  can actually see
[947.46 --> 948.20]  what I'm talking about.
[948.60 --> 948.88]  Oh,
[948.98 --> 949.36]  yes,
[949.48 --> 950.60]  there we go.
[951.30 --> 952.74]  As George Takei
[952.74 --> 953.32]  would say,
[953.54 --> 954.40]  oh my.
[955.48 --> 955.84]  So,
[955.92 --> 956.64]  rather than the
[956.64 --> 957.42]  anodized finish
[957.42 --> 958.18]  that comes stock
[958.18 --> 958.84]  on this case,
[958.90 --> 959.68]  we now have
[959.68 --> 960.64]  kind of a textured
[960.64 --> 961.50]  look
[961.50 --> 962.80]  that is extremely
[962.80 --> 963.38]  resilient
[963.38 --> 964.82]  so it's not
[964.82 --> 966.76]  subject to damage
[966.76 --> 967.52]  very easily
[967.52 --> 969.02]  from sort of
[969.02 --> 970.70]  random scuffs
[970.70 --> 971.24]  when you're,
[971.30 --> 971.46]  you know,
[971.52 --> 972.62]  routing cables around
[972.62 --> 973.52]  and things like that.
[973.60 --> 974.44]  I'm just going to,
[974.44 --> 975.12]  I want to zoom out
[975.12 --> 975.52]  a little bit
[975.52 --> 976.48]  so they can sort of
[976.48 --> 977.22]  see it overall.
[977.36 --> 978.26]  So cable management's
[978.26 --> 978.82]  going to be done.
[979.22 --> 980.12]  I have all,
[980.34 --> 981.80]  not individually,
[982.04 --> 983.12]  but two wires
[983.12 --> 983.88]  per sleeve
[983.88 --> 984.60]  done wires.
[984.60 --> 985.34]  So they're going to
[985.34 --> 985.94]  come out around
[985.94 --> 986.88]  the board this way.
[988.28 --> 989.72]  I still haven't decided
[989.72 --> 990.26]  if I'm going to
[990.26 --> 991.34]  live stream the actual
[991.34 --> 992.38]  building of it yet
[992.38 --> 993.92]  because it's kind of
[993.92 --> 995.98]  a pain to coordinate
[995.98 --> 997.56]  live streaming it,
[997.72 --> 998.48]  especially because
[998.48 --> 999.00]  I'll be kind of
[999.00 --> 999.64]  working at it,
[999.68 --> 1000.40]  working on it
[1000.40 --> 1001.28]  all hours of night.
[1001.40 --> 1002.02]  Let me do a focus
[1002.02 --> 1002.34]  on the board.
[1002.36 --> 1002.80]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1002.94 --> 1003.32]  Don't worry,
[1003.36 --> 1003.76]  that's why I'm bringing
[1003.76 --> 1004.18]  this over here.
[1004.48 --> 1005.38]  I've also got my,
[1005.44 --> 1005.94]  those of you who
[1005.94 --> 1006.76]  follow me on Twitter
[1006.76 --> 1007.86]  will know about this.
[1008.22 --> 1009.16]  So I've also got
[1009.16 --> 1010.22]  the block mounted
[1010.22 --> 1010.84]  on the board.
[1011.20 --> 1012.40]  So I haven't quite decided
[1012.40 --> 1013.18]  if I'm going to go
[1013.18 --> 1014.16]  permanently with the
[1014.16 --> 1014.92]  Crucial Ballistics
[1014.92 --> 1015.58]  Tracer memory
[1015.58 --> 1016.42]  that's in here now.
[1016.78 --> 1017.68]  But that's what
[1017.68 --> 1018.52]  the gold-plated
[1018.52 --> 1019.42]  Apogee HD
[1019.42 --> 1020.66]  with the black
[1020.66 --> 1021.76]  wrinkle painted
[1021.76 --> 1022.46]  hold down.
[1022.56 --> 1023.30]  So that'll actually
[1023.30 --> 1024.60]  match the finish
[1024.60 --> 1025.16]  of the inside
[1025.16 --> 1025.76]  of the case.
[1026.24 --> 1027.32]  Those are BitPhoenix
[1027.32 --> 1029.12]  gold-plated
[1029.12 --> 1030.06]  compression fittings.
[1030.16 --> 1031.98]  Those are 5.8 OD,
[1032.48 --> 1033.62]  3.8 ID.
[1034.12 --> 1035.68]  Did I say BitPhoenix?
[1035.78 --> 1036.54]  I meant Bit's Power.
[1036.70 --> 1037.26]  Sorry, BitPhoenix
[1037.26 --> 1037.82]  doesn't make
[1037.82 --> 1039.24]  compression fittings.
[1039.78 --> 1040.28]  And then,
[1040.28 --> 1041.48]  so that is going
[1041.48 --> 1042.16]  to go in there.
[1042.30 --> 1042.78]  Got my,
[1042.84 --> 1044.14]  got big plans.
[1044.16 --> 1045.26]  Got a lot of
[1045.26 --> 1046.38]  stuff going on.
[1046.92 --> 1047.62]  A lot of
[1047.62 --> 1048.46]  stuff going on.
[1048.56 --> 1049.14]  I get to be the
[1049.14 --> 1049.64]  decider
[1049.64 --> 1050.78]  of this particular
[1050.78 --> 1051.58]  computer here.
[1052.60 --> 1054.00]  So that's exciting.
[1054.34 --> 1055.10]  Finally making
[1055.10 --> 1055.80]  some progress.
[1055.96 --> 1056.54]  I'm hoping
[1056.54 --> 1057.90]  to have a
[1057.90 --> 1058.78]  desktop computer
[1058.78 --> 1059.84]  for the first time
[1059.84 --> 1060.94]  since Slick and I
[1060.94 --> 1061.46]  have been working
[1061.46 --> 1061.96]  together
[1061.96 --> 1064.00]  on my desk
[1064.00 --> 1064.50]  sometime
[1064.50 --> 1065.50]  in the next,
[1065.62 --> 1065.90]  I don't know,
[1065.90 --> 1066.20]  what do you think?
[1066.24 --> 1066.70]  Can I get it done
[1066.70 --> 1067.06]  in a week?
[1069.74 --> 1070.22]  Maybe.
[1071.10 --> 1071.54]  Maybe.
[1071.88 --> 1072.40]  We have a busy
[1072.40 --> 1072.66]  week.
[1073.12 --> 1073.70]  I know.
[1074.12 --> 1074.68]  Like a really
[1074.68 --> 1075.18]  busy week.
[1075.26 --> 1075.92]  I know.
[1076.18 --> 1076.62]  That's the only
[1076.62 --> 1077.22]  reason I'm saying
[1077.22 --> 1077.50]  maybe.
[1077.62 --> 1078.00]  I'm not saying
[1078.00 --> 1078.34]  like, oh,
[1078.38 --> 1079.04]  you can't do it.
[1079.08 --> 1079.72]  Like, I just think
[1079.72 --> 1080.66]  we're really busy.
[1081.32 --> 1081.72]  Um.
[1081.92 --> 1082.54]  And you have
[1082.54 --> 1084.54]  other preoccupations.
[1085.26 --> 1086.22]  Yeah, I know.
[1086.64 --> 1087.44]  I have to work
[1087.44 --> 1088.06]  a Saturday,
[1088.22 --> 1089.18]  which kind of sucks.
[1089.48 --> 1089.74]  Yeah.
[1090.22 --> 1090.98]  But whatever.
[1090.98 --> 1092.66]  So here,
[1092.72 --> 1093.38]  I've got something
[1093.38 --> 1094.14]  you apparently
[1094.14 --> 1094.74]  wanted to talk
[1094.74 --> 1095.32]  about while I
[1095.32 --> 1096.04]  look for something
[1096.04 --> 1096.58]  to talk about.
[1096.60 --> 1096.90]  Ah.
[1097.40 --> 1097.76]  Yes.
[1098.10 --> 1098.32]  Here.
[1098.68 --> 1099.06]  Excited.
[1099.72 --> 1100.62]  So Slick needs
[1100.62 --> 1101.16]  to borrow my
[1101.16 --> 1102.06]  PlayStation 3
[1102.06 --> 1103.16]  that I have used
[1103.16 --> 1104.74]  exactly one time
[1104.74 --> 1106.10]  when I had that
[1106.10 --> 1107.06]  Street Fighter tournament
[1107.06 --> 1107.76]  with Tom,
[1107.86 --> 1109.08]  the NCIX artist.
[1109.80 --> 1110.08]  Okay.
[1110.34 --> 1110.58]  So,
[1111.22 --> 1111.68]  a lot of people
[1111.68 --> 1112.10]  are going to be like,
[1112.18 --> 1112.52]  why the heck
[1112.52 --> 1114.92]  is Slick
[1114.92 --> 1115.90]  excited for a PS3?
[1115.96 --> 1116.08]  Yeah,
[1116.12 --> 1116.88]  why are you excited
[1116.88 --> 1117.66]  about a PS3?
[1117.74 --> 1118.44]  That's a console.
[1118.78 --> 1119.08]  Okay.
[1119.08 --> 1121.52]  You almost smell
[1121.52 --> 1122.20]  worse already.
[1122.28 --> 1123.16]  Just because the PS3
[1123.16 --> 1123.40]  is here?
[1123.44 --> 1123.58]  No,
[1123.64 --> 1123.98]  just because you
[1123.98 --> 1124.72]  don't shower often.
[1124.94 --> 1125.18]  What?
[1127.26 --> 1127.74]  Jerk.
[1128.26 --> 1128.66]  Anyways.
[1130.44 --> 1130.88]  So,
[1131.22 --> 1131.70]  a lot of you
[1131.70 --> 1132.04]  probably know
[1132.04 --> 1132.64]  what EVE is.
[1132.88 --> 1133.28]  The big
[1133.28 --> 1134.98]  spaceship game.
[1135.82 --> 1136.48]  In that,
[1136.66 --> 1137.24]  there's tons
[1137.24 --> 1138.10]  of different styles
[1138.10 --> 1138.60]  of combat
[1138.60 --> 1139.66]  and huge wars
[1139.66 --> 1140.58]  constantly going on.
[1141.28 --> 1141.74]  Anyways,
[1142.22 --> 1142.86]  CCP,
[1143.10 --> 1143.80]  the guys who make EVE,
[1144.06 --> 1144.96]  just finished developing
[1144.96 --> 1145.52]  a game called
[1145.52 --> 1146.42]  Dust 514.
[1146.94 --> 1147.66]  Dust 514
[1147.66 --> 1148.96]  is a first-person
[1148.96 --> 1149.54]  shooter game
[1149.54 --> 1149.96]  that is going
[1149.96 --> 1150.58]  to integrate
[1150.58 --> 1151.46]  with EVE.
[1151.72 --> 1152.04]  So,
[1152.10 --> 1152.96]  the idea is
[1152.96 --> 1153.52]  that you're still
[1153.52 --> 1154.44]  inside the EVE universe
[1154.44 --> 1156.38]  but you are mercenaries
[1156.38 --> 1157.36]  that will fight
[1157.36 --> 1158.60]  on planetary surfaces.
[1159.66 --> 1159.68]  So,
[1160.64 --> 1160.98]  oh,
[1161.14 --> 1161.86]  excited for that.
[1162.78 --> 1163.28]  Like,
[1163.40 --> 1164.04]  big corporations
[1164.04 --> 1164.84]  or little guys
[1164.84 --> 1165.22]  or whatever
[1165.22 --> 1167.50]  can hire you out
[1167.50 --> 1168.18]  as mercenaries
[1168.18 --> 1168.68]  to attack
[1168.68 --> 1169.36]  different targets
[1169.36 --> 1170.88]  and fight
[1170.88 --> 1172.14]  in an FPS game
[1172.14 --> 1173.14]  being hired
[1173.14 --> 1173.80]  by people
[1173.80 --> 1175.06]  in the
[1175.06 --> 1176.00]  spaceship game.
[1176.00 --> 1176.38]  You look a lot
[1176.38 --> 1176.92]  bigger than me.
[1176.92 --> 1177.50]  Can you move back?
[1179.00 --> 1179.54]  There we go.
[1179.60 --> 1179.94]  That's better.
[1180.40 --> 1181.08]  It's still a lot
[1181.08 --> 1181.46]  bigger than me.
[1181.48 --> 1181.62]  Yeah,
[1181.64 --> 1181.84]  I know.
[1181.92 --> 1182.14]  Whatever.
[1182.52 --> 1183.04]  Have I set up?
[1183.54 --> 1184.08]  Why don't you just
[1184.08 --> 1184.56]  talk about your
[1184.56 --> 1184.86]  PlayStation?
[1186.56 --> 1186.96]  But,
[1187.12 --> 1187.92]  unfortunately,
[1188.30 --> 1189.16]  it's only on
[1189.16 --> 1190.14]  freaking PlayStation.
[1192.38 --> 1192.86]  CCCP,
[1193.14 --> 1194.16]  they're a PC developer.
[1194.50 --> 1195.28]  Make it for PC.
[1195.68 --> 1196.24]  What are you doing?
[1196.40 --> 1197.38]  It's a free-to-play game
[1197.38 --> 1198.22]  so I don't have to
[1198.22 --> 1199.40]  invest anything into it
[1199.40 --> 1200.00]  which is nice
[1200.00 --> 1200.82]  but like,
[1200.94 --> 1201.14]  what?
[1201.88 --> 1202.90]  Here's my speculation.
[1204.22 --> 1204.74]  Okay,
[1204.82 --> 1204.96]  okay,
[1205.02 --> 1205.14]  here.
[1205.30 --> 1206.16]  I've been saying
[1206.16 --> 1206.88]  for a while
[1206.88 --> 1208.40]  that one of the reasons
[1208.40 --> 1209.76]  that modern games
[1209.76 --> 1210.96]  are kind of
[1210.96 --> 1211.66]  easier
[1211.66 --> 1212.92]  is because
[1212.92 --> 1213.84]  you have to compensate
[1213.84 --> 1214.38]  for stuff
[1214.38 --> 1215.24]  that we didn't used to.
[1215.72 --> 1215.88]  So,
[1216.04 --> 1217.08]  LCD TVs have
[1217.08 --> 1218.02]  way higher input lag
[1218.02 --> 1219.00]  compared to CRT TVs.
[1219.02 --> 1219.62]  The Mario argument,
[1219.76 --> 1219.88]  yeah.
[1220.68 --> 1221.20]  Yeah,
[1221.26 --> 1222.16]  the Mario thing
[1222.16 --> 1223.12]  that we've talked about before.
[1224.40 --> 1225.26]  Any game
[1225.26 --> 1225.98]  that relies
[1225.98 --> 1227.86]  on an internet connection
[1227.86 --> 1228.78]  that goes beyond
[1228.78 --> 1229.50]  even your own.
[1229.62 --> 1230.56]  Your own internet connection
[1230.56 --> 1231.16]  might be fine
[1231.16 --> 1231.86]  but if it relies
[1231.86 --> 1232.80]  on someone else
[1232.80 --> 1234.68]  with a 250 millisecond ping
[1234.68 --> 1236.40]  the game just has
[1236.40 --> 1237.14]  to be dumbed down.
[1237.66 --> 1237.88]  So,
[1238.02 --> 1238.90]  here's my speculation.
[1239.18 --> 1240.30]  Because the EVE universe
[1240.30 --> 1241.52]  is so large
[1241.52 --> 1242.36]  and so
[1242.36 --> 1243.70]  inherently
[1243.70 --> 1245.38]  probably latency ridden
[1245.38 --> 1246.24]  Easy to run.
[1247.18 --> 1247.28]  Yeah,
[1247.28 --> 1247.88]  but it doesn't matter
[1247.88 --> 1248.52]  if it's easy to run
[1248.52 --> 1249.58]  because it's a latency issue
[1249.58 --> 1250.18]  not a bandwidth issue.
[1250.18 --> 1250.84]  Due to graphics
[1250.84 --> 1252.44]  being so far away
[1252.44 --> 1253.32]  it's not hard to run
[1253.32 --> 1253.86]  there isn't really
[1253.86 --> 1254.80]  that much latency problems
[1254.80 --> 1255.06]  in you.
[1255.50 --> 1255.76]  Okay,
[1255.86 --> 1256.22]  but if it,
[1256.32 --> 1256.50]  okay,
[1256.68 --> 1257.36]  so there aren't
[1257.36 --> 1258.26]  latency problems
[1258.26 --> 1258.54]  Well,
[1258.60 --> 1259.12]  of course
[1259.12 --> 1259.86]  there's latency problems.
[1260.10 --> 1261.02]  A flying perspective
[1261.02 --> 1262.04]  but if it was
[1262.04 --> 1263.48]  a Twitch first person shooter
[1263.48 --> 1265.08]  like a Counter-Strike shooter
[1265.08 --> 1266.06]  You can interface
[1266.06 --> 1267.18]  with the other universe
[1267.18 --> 1267.62]  Yes.
[1268.04 --> 1269.44]  You're not in the other universe.
[1269.54 --> 1269.62]  Oh,
[1269.68 --> 1270.22]  you're not in the other universe.
[1270.22 --> 1270.94]  It's its own game.
[1271.04 --> 1271.90]  It's on a PS3.
[1272.10 --> 1273.12]  It's not the same engine.
[1274.62 --> 1274.94]  Okay,
[1275.04 --> 1276.16]  I thought it was
[1276.16 --> 1277.86]  within the other universe
[1277.86 --> 1278.54]  I don't think so.
[1278.54 --> 1278.72]  Somehow.
[1278.96 --> 1279.50]  I don't think so.
[1279.58 --> 1280.70]  I think they'll probably
[1280.70 --> 1282.00]  I'm certain
[1282.00 --> 1283.08]  they'll talk to each other
[1283.08 --> 1283.52]  of course
[1283.52 --> 1284.04]  they have to
[1284.04 --> 1284.58]  in some way
[1284.58 --> 1285.42]  but they're not
[1285.42 --> 1287.38]  actually the exact same thing.
[1288.10 --> 1288.50]  Okay,
[1288.64 --> 1288.80]  okay.
[1288.80 --> 1289.58]  Because that would be
[1289.58 --> 1290.26]  insane.
[1291.08 --> 1292.12]  So it's free to play
[1292.12 --> 1292.56]  if nothing.
[1292.64 --> 1293.62]  Is it free to play permanently?
[1294.16 --> 1294.60]  Honestly,
[1294.76 --> 1295.68]  this is a lot of stuff
[1295.68 --> 1296.30]  that I picked up
[1296.30 --> 1296.92]  very quickly
[1296.92 --> 1297.74]  off of a website
[1297.74 --> 1298.98]  that I just kind of skimmed.
[1298.98 --> 1301.26]  So I read free to play.
[1301.84 --> 1303.74]  Apparently the financials
[1303.74 --> 1304.46]  that you're dealing with
[1304.46 --> 1305.38]  is Isk and Arum.
[1305.84 --> 1306.80]  Isk is
[1306.80 --> 1307.54]  well,
[1307.68 --> 1308.40]  the game was developed
[1308.40 --> 1308.80]  in Iceland
[1308.80 --> 1310.84]  so Isk is Icelandic money
[1310.84 --> 1312.30]  but Isk in the game
[1312.30 --> 1313.46]  is just normal money.
[1313.86 --> 1315.06]  Arum is money
[1315.06 --> 1315.54]  that you can put
[1315.54 --> 1316.10]  into the game
[1316.10 --> 1318.20]  but they're saying
[1318.20 --> 1319.00]  it's not a pay to win.
[1319.16 --> 1319.92]  I think right now
[1319.92 --> 1320.88]  the Arum is only going
[1320.88 --> 1321.38]  to be used
[1321.38 --> 1322.50]  for cosmetic changes
[1322.50 --> 1323.26]  which is fine.
[1323.82 --> 1324.64]  I have no problem
[1324.64 --> 1325.08]  with that.
[1325.62 --> 1325.88]  Okay.
[1326.28 --> 1327.10]  People will buy it
[1327.10 --> 1327.66]  anyway though
[1327.66 --> 1328.62]  for some reason.
[1328.62 --> 1329.40]  Eve,
[1329.60 --> 1330.60]  when they first
[1330.60 --> 1331.26]  introduced this
[1331.26 --> 1332.40]  had like really
[1332.40 --> 1334.10]  really expensive stuff.
[1335.02 --> 1336.74]  Like $25 jackets
[1336.74 --> 1338.98]  and like
[1338.98 --> 1340.04]  a lot of
[1340.04 --> 1340.90]  really expensive stuff.
[1341.10 --> 1341.80]  Like monocles
[1341.80 --> 1342.40]  that you could buy
[1342.40 --> 1342.82]  that were like
[1342.82 --> 1343.82]  super uber expensive.
[1344.80 --> 1346.18]  Here's a debate for you.
[1348.46 --> 1349.30]  Is it
[1349.30 --> 1350.90]  Okay, okay.
[1350.98 --> 1351.52]  Like you and I
[1351.52 --> 1352.94]  would probably sit privately
[1352.94 --> 1353.58]  and talk about
[1353.58 --> 1354.24]  how it's crazy
[1354.24 --> 1355.18]  to buy an in-game
[1355.18 --> 1356.48]  customization thing
[1356.48 --> 1357.06]  for your character.
[1357.14 --> 1357.74]  I have though.
[1358.02 --> 1358.58]  You have?
[1358.72 --> 1359.38]  Okay, see this
[1359.38 --> 1359.88]  I didn't know.
[1360.50 --> 1361.24]  But I would argue
[1361.24 --> 1361.96]  It is crazy
[1361.96 --> 1362.58]  but I have.
[1362.68 --> 1363.58]  Okay, I would argue
[1363.58 --> 1364.74]  that it's not any different
[1364.74 --> 1366.16]  from buying a cool hoodie
[1366.16 --> 1366.80]  to wear.
[1367.54 --> 1368.48]  Which is why
[1368.48 --> 1369.22]  honestly I have.
[1369.40 --> 1370.34]  My favorite character
[1370.34 --> 1370.86]  in Eve
[1370.86 --> 1371.48]  I have every
[1371.48 --> 1373.22]  favorite character
[1373.22 --> 1373.98]  in League of Legends
[1373.98 --> 1374.50]  there we go
[1374.50 --> 1375.32]  completely different game
[1375.32 --> 1376.62]  I have every single
[1376.62 --> 1377.04]  skin for.
[1377.54 --> 1378.66]  I didn't buy all of them
[1378.66 --> 1379.24]  a couple of them
[1379.24 --> 1379.92]  were gifted to me
[1379.92 --> 1381.06]  but I think I bought
[1381.06 --> 1381.46]  like two.
[1382.16 --> 1382.86]  And like I've played
[1382.86 --> 1383.62]  if you think about it
[1383.62 --> 1384.38]  over the course of
[1384.38 --> 1385.18]  playing that character
[1385.18 --> 1385.86]  I've played like
[1385.86 --> 1387.74]  before they changed
[1387.74 --> 1388.16]  everything
[1388.16 --> 1389.72]  because now you can't
[1389.72 --> 1390.36]  track the amount
[1390.36 --> 1391.38]  of losses and wins
[1391.38 --> 1392.26]  per character
[1392.26 --> 1393.60]  in all of your games.
[1393.74 --> 1393.96]  Really?
[1394.18 --> 1394.88]  You used to be able to
[1394.88 --> 1395.58]  now it's only ranked.
[1395.70 --> 1396.60]  Why would they take that out?
[1396.66 --> 1397.06]  I don't know.
[1397.16 --> 1398.02]  It's really annoying actually.
[1398.24 --> 1399.04]  There might be some
[1399.04 --> 1399.74]  weird funky way
[1399.74 --> 1400.38]  to do it externally
[1400.38 --> 1400.92]  from the game
[1400.92 --> 1401.52]  but not internally.
[1401.90 --> 1402.74]  Anyways, before they
[1402.74 --> 1403.18]  took that out
[1403.18 --> 1404.38]  so pre-season one
[1404.38 --> 1405.34]  we're now in I think
[1405.34 --> 1406.86]  season three or four
[1406.86 --> 1407.76]  I don't really follow
[1407.76 --> 1408.38]  it that much anymore
[1408.38 --> 1409.52]  but pre-season one
[1409.52 --> 1410.98]  I had like 1400 games
[1410.98 --> 1411.26]  played
[1411.26 --> 1412.10]  and each game
[1412.10 --> 1412.94]  is like half an hour.
[1414.20 --> 1416.84]  So I had tons of time
[1416.84 --> 1417.84]  poured into this.
[1418.48 --> 1419.88]  Don't figure it out.
[1420.42 --> 1421.36]  Don't figure it out.
[1421.88 --> 1422.52]  I'm doing it.
[1423.80 --> 1426.46]  Okay, so 1400 games?
[1426.94 --> 1427.42]  Games.
[1427.52 --> 1428.94]  Okay, so times 30
[1428.94 --> 1431.18]  is okay
[1431.18 --> 1433.00]  42,000 minutes
[1433.00 --> 1434.68]  divided by 60
[1434.68 --> 1437.52]  is 700 hours
[1437.52 --> 1438.50]  okay
[1438.50 --> 1440.12]  divided by 24
[1440.12 --> 1441.54]  is
[1441.54 --> 1443.08]  you spent literally
[1443.08 --> 1444.80]  an entire month
[1444.80 --> 1445.80]  of time.
[1445.88 --> 1446.54]  That sounds about right
[1446.54 --> 1446.84]  actually.
[1447.04 --> 1447.34]  Yeah.
[1447.70 --> 1449.04]  Like an entire month
[1449.04 --> 1449.54]  of time
[1449.54 --> 1450.48]  actually like
[1450.48 --> 1452.24]  in matches then.
[1452.98 --> 1453.70]  So not counting
[1453.70 --> 1454.64]  launching the game.
[1454.92 --> 1455.20]  Wait.
[1455.76 --> 1456.38]  Yes, I would.
[1456.50 --> 1457.00]  That would be a day.
[1457.26 --> 1458.06]  Because I'm thinking
[1458.06 --> 1458.70]  well I'm thinking
[1458.70 --> 1459.64]  off my expire time
[1459.64 --> 1460.28]  for a quick second.
[1460.76 --> 1461.16]  Oh, okay.
[1461.16 --> 1461.94]  Because my expire time
[1461.94 --> 1462.40]  is absurd
[1462.40 --> 1463.20]  but I would idle it
[1463.20 --> 1463.84]  for like a day
[1463.84 --> 1464.60]  so it didn't really go.
[1464.60 --> 1464.90]  Right.
[1466.14 --> 1467.12]  I used to play a lot.
[1467.12 --> 1467.94]  I used to be really good.
[1468.06 --> 1469.22]  I'm not really good anymore.
[1469.38 --> 1470.28]  Yeah, you're not really good
[1470.28 --> 1470.58]  anymore.
[1470.58 --> 1470.60]  I'm kind of trash now
[1470.60 --> 1471.26]  but whatever.
[1471.88 --> 1472.48]  Actually you're good
[1472.48 --> 1472.98]  at some things.
[1473.04 --> 1473.58]  That's not fair.
[1476.00 --> 1476.70]  What was I going to say?
[1476.74 --> 1477.48]  Yeah, so I bought skins
[1477.48 --> 1477.80]  for that
[1477.80 --> 1478.72]  but then I played it
[1478.72 --> 1479.46]  so much
[1479.46 --> 1480.42]  that it was like
[1480.42 --> 1480.72]  whatever.
[1480.90 --> 1481.74]  So you justify it
[1481.74 --> 1482.12]  that way.
[1482.26 --> 1483.22]  Yeah, I wanted it
[1483.22 --> 1483.76]  to look cool.
[1483.84 --> 1484.82]  It's a free to play game
[1484.82 --> 1485.72]  if I'm only putting
[1485.72 --> 1486.50]  that much money in
[1486.50 --> 1487.26]  and I used it
[1487.26 --> 1488.24]  for that amount of time
[1488.24 --> 1490.04]  like that's fine.
[1490.26 --> 1490.68]  I don't care.
[1490.68 --> 1492.30]  All right.
[1492.50 --> 1493.46]  DJs joining in
[1493.46 --> 1494.18]  from New Jersey
[1494.18 --> 1495.50]  tuning in live
[1495.50 --> 1496.32]  for the first time
[1496.32 --> 1497.10]  from the UK.
[1497.74 --> 1498.66]  Next gen consoles
[1498.66 --> 1499.48]  will they raise
[1499.48 --> 1500.72]  the hardware market
[1500.72 --> 1502.44]  back to expensive levels?
[1502.58 --> 1503.12]  For example
[1503.12 --> 1504.94]  RAM is way cheaper
[1504.94 --> 1506.26]  than seven years ago.
[1507.78 --> 1508.62]  You know what?
[1508.68 --> 1509.52]  The PC industry
[1509.52 --> 1510.62]  does this to itself
[1510.62 --> 1512.02]  where it keeps
[1512.02 --> 1512.34]  like
[1512.34 --> 1514.12]  They just kill margins.
[1514.46 --> 1514.86]  They just
[1514.86 --> 1515.52]  well what
[1515.52 --> 1516.00]  Okay.
[1516.40 --> 1517.16]  The consumer
[1517.16 --> 1518.74]  says over and over again
[1518.74 --> 1519.36]  more choice
[1519.36 --> 1519.88]  more choice
[1519.88 --> 1520.38]  more choice
[1520.38 --> 1521.12]  more competitors
[1521.12 --> 1522.66]  but I would argue
[1522.66 --> 1523.64]  that in some ways
[1523.64 --> 1524.56]  it can actually
[1524.56 --> 1525.60]  hurt the consumer.
[1526.18 --> 1526.82]  So I know
[1526.82 --> 1527.50]  you don't like
[1527.50 --> 1528.02]  this argument
[1528.02 --> 1528.92]  but we're going
[1528.92 --> 1529.60]  down this path
[1529.60 --> 1530.14]  whether you like it
[1530.14 --> 1530.44]  or not.
[1531.74 --> 1532.76]  Here's an example.
[1533.96 --> 1534.36]  If
[1534.36 --> 1535.50]  there was
[1535.50 --> 1536.90]  two players
[1536.90 --> 1537.48]  in the market
[1537.48 --> 1538.32]  and let's say
[1538.32 --> 1538.90]  they were both
[1538.90 --> 1540.02]  extremely principled
[1540.02 --> 1541.30]  and believed
[1541.30 --> 1541.76]  in building
[1541.76 --> 1543.08]  the highest quality
[1543.08 --> 1543.90]  widget
[1543.90 --> 1545.40]  okay
[1545.40 --> 1546.50]  they both believed
[1546.50 --> 1546.78]  in building
[1546.78 --> 1547.42]  the highest quality
[1547.42 --> 1547.66]  widget
[1547.66 --> 1548.10]  let's say
[1548.10 --> 1548.50]  one of them
[1548.50 --> 1549.90]  had 70% market share
[1549.90 --> 1550.24]  and one of them
[1550.24 --> 1551.46]  had 30% market share
[1551.46 --> 1552.00]  and one of them
[1552.00 --> 1552.32]  you know
[1552.32 --> 1552.92]  tried to do more
[1552.92 --> 1553.34]  promotions
[1553.34 --> 1555.20]  or do whatever else
[1555.20 --> 1557.16]  but by and large
[1557.16 --> 1558.86]  they didn't sort of
[1558.86 --> 1560.12]  bow to shareholder
[1560.12 --> 1560.58]  pressure
[1560.58 --> 1561.80]  to increase
[1561.80 --> 1562.88]  their revenues
[1562.88 --> 1564.04]  X amount percent
[1564.04 --> 1564.86]  year over year
[1564.86 --> 1565.66]  or do whatever else
[1565.66 --> 1566.08]  they need to do
[1566.08 --> 1566.78]  but they believed
[1566.78 --> 1567.52]  in building the best
[1567.52 --> 1567.74]  widget
[1567.74 --> 1568.50]  and making a decent
[1568.50 --> 1568.86]  margin.
[1569.40 --> 1569.82]  Let's say
[1569.82 --> 1570.82]  competitor C
[1570.82 --> 1571.40]  or D
[1571.40 --> 1571.86]  or E
[1571.86 --> 1572.32]  or F
[1572.32 --> 1572.76]  or G
[1572.76 --> 1574.18]  all pile into
[1574.18 --> 1574.70]  this market
[1574.70 --> 1575.66]  and make cheap
[1575.66 --> 1576.30]  ripoffs
[1576.30 --> 1577.66]  all of a sudden
[1577.66 --> 1579.04]  those first two guys
[1579.04 --> 1580.86]  have to compromise
[1580.86 --> 1581.54]  the quality
[1581.54 --> 1583.28]  they have to
[1583.28 --> 1584.46]  this is a new angle
[1584.46 --> 1585.20]  in this argument
[1585.20 --> 1586.24]  that I have to agree with
[1586.24 --> 1587.04]  and we talked about
[1587.04 --> 1587.88]  this a little while ago
[1587.88 --> 1588.38]  when we were
[1588.38 --> 1589.76]  talking about this case
[1589.76 --> 1590.26]  right
[1590.26 --> 1590.80]  I don't want to go
[1590.80 --> 1591.68]  way too into
[1591.68 --> 1593.60]  the TJ07
[1593.60 --> 1595.12]  we both believe
[1595.12 --> 1596.14]  that it's pretty much
[1596.14 --> 1596.92]  the best case
[1596.92 --> 1597.62]  ever made
[1597.62 --> 1599.30]  I mean
[1599.30 --> 1599.78]  there might be
[1599.78 --> 1600.44]  a couple notable
[1600.44 --> 1600.94]  exceptions
[1600.94 --> 1601.60]  you could argue
[1601.60 --> 1602.50]  Charles's mark
[1602.50 --> 1603.18]  2 or mark
[1603.18 --> 1603.70]  3 or whatever
[1603.70 --> 1604.22]  it's called
[1604.22 --> 1605.24]  which is just
[1605.24 --> 1605.84]  an iteration
[1605.84 --> 1606.72]  of the TJ07
[1606.72 --> 1607.78]  is better
[1607.78 --> 1608.30]  in some ways
[1608.30 --> 1608.80]  it's not better
[1608.80 --> 1609.54]  for my purposes
[1609.54 --> 1610.16]  it can't hold
[1610.16 --> 1610.72]  enough drives
[1610.72 --> 1611.28]  for one thing
[1611.28 --> 1612.52]  it's very limited
[1612.52 --> 1613.38]  in terms of
[1613.38 --> 1614.26]  I'm still expecting
[1614.26 --> 1615.24]  to be using this case
[1615.24 --> 1616.06]  five years from now
[1616.06 --> 1616.36]  I don't know
[1616.36 --> 1616.72]  what hardware
[1616.72 --> 1617.34]  is going to look like
[1617.34 --> 1617.58]  I don't know
[1617.58 --> 1618.04]  if it fits
[1618.04 --> 1618.34]  in the way
[1618.34 --> 1618.66]  he's done
[1618.66 --> 1619.40]  his cable management
[1619.40 --> 1620.52]  so there's
[1620.52 --> 1621.26]  all that stuff
[1621.26 --> 1621.90]  very specific
[1621.90 --> 1623.00]  you could argue
[1623.00 --> 1624.16]  the TJ11 is better
[1624.16 --> 1624.80]  because it has
[1624.80 --> 1625.36]  more features
[1625.36 --> 1626.44]  it's newer
[1626.44 --> 1627.68]  I wouldn't necessarily
[1627.68 --> 1628.54]  agree that it's better
[1628.54 --> 1629.96]  I still like this one
[1629.96 --> 1630.34]  more though
[1630.34 --> 1631.24]  and the form factor
[1631.24 --> 1631.76]  is nicer
[1631.76 --> 1632.24]  because it's not
[1632.24 --> 1633.22]  quite so huge
[1633.22 --> 1634.46]  but anyway
[1634.46 --> 1635.08]  we both agree
[1635.08 --> 1635.58]  that it's better
[1635.58 --> 1636.80]  and even this case
[1636.80 --> 1637.46]  so this case
[1637.46 --> 1638.52]  it must be like
[1638.52 --> 1639.48]  a six, seven year old
[1639.48 --> 1640.04]  design now
[1640.04 --> 1641.92]  might even be more than that
[1641.92 --> 1642.46]  because they have
[1642.46 --> 1643.12]  a new iteration
[1643.12 --> 1643.54]  even
[1643.54 --> 1643.96]  yeah
[1643.96 --> 1645.62]  it's an old design
[1645.62 --> 1647.52]  so there's that
[1647.52 --> 1649.42]  and even this case
[1649.42 --> 1651.30]  has been downgraded
[1651.30 --> 1653.74]  because things like metal
[1653.74 --> 1655.32]  are still on the rise
[1655.32 --> 1656.24]  in terms of costs
[1656.24 --> 1657.44]  they're not going to get cheaper
[1657.44 --> 1659.44]  the actual amount
[1659.44 --> 1660.16]  that a consumer
[1660.16 --> 1661.30]  is willing to pay
[1661.30 --> 1662.86]  I mean when you can buy
[1662.86 --> 1664.34]  a BitPhoenix Merc
[1664.34 --> 1665.00]  for $30
[1665.00 --> 1668.44]  I think fewer people
[1668.44 --> 1669.12]  are going to drop
[1669.12 --> 1670.62]  $300 on a TJ07
[1670.62 --> 1671.64]  now you could argue
[1671.64 --> 1672.74]  that's a different customer
[1672.74 --> 1673.68]  however
[1673.68 --> 1674.62]  you could also go
[1674.62 --> 1674.92]  okay
[1674.92 --> 1675.98]  just because a customer
[1675.98 --> 1678.06]  has $300 to blow
[1678.06 --> 1678.60]  on their computer
[1678.60 --> 1679.42]  doesn't mean they drop
[1679.42 --> 1680.12]  it on their case
[1680.12 --> 1682.18]  maybe they put it
[1682.18 --> 1683.14]  into their video card
[1683.14 --> 1683.78]  maybe they decide
[1683.78 --> 1684.30]  okay well
[1684.30 --> 1685.26]  you know case doesn't matter
[1685.26 --> 1686.96]  because a great computer
[1686.96 --> 1687.40]  these days
[1687.40 --> 1688.16]  costs only around
[1688.16 --> 1688.50]  $1,200
[1688.50 --> 1691.00]  so why am I blowing
[1691.00 --> 1691.54]  a ton of
[1691.54 --> 1692.28]  why am I going to spend
[1692.28 --> 1692.72]  $300, $400
[1692.72 --> 1694.08]  on a really nice case
[1694.08 --> 1694.28]  right
[1694.28 --> 1694.78]  because that's
[1694.78 --> 1696.06]  25% of your budget now
[1696.06 --> 1696.74]  whereas when you were
[1696.74 --> 1697.78]  spending $2,000
[1697.78 --> 1698.78]  to get an awesome
[1698.78 --> 1699.46]  gaming machine
[1699.46 --> 1700.62]  $300 for a case
[1700.62 --> 1701.28]  didn't seem like
[1701.28 --> 1702.36]  such a crazy thing
[1702.36 --> 1703.26]  okay
[1703.26 --> 1703.94]  but I mean
[1703.94 --> 1704.80]  you can make the argument
[1704.80 --> 1705.44]  that it's good
[1705.44 --> 1706.44]  for prices to decline
[1706.44 --> 1707.30]  it's good for consumers
[1707.30 --> 1707.92]  to get more
[1707.92 --> 1708.60]  more performance
[1708.60 --> 1709.20]  for their dollar
[1709.20 --> 1711.14]  this comes in
[1711.14 --> 1712.58]  with almost every market
[1712.58 --> 1712.90]  too
[1712.90 --> 1713.56]  we're not even
[1713.56 --> 1714.26]  just saying
[1714.26 --> 1714.92]  VCs
[1714.92 --> 1716.08]  like if you just
[1716.08 --> 1716.84]  look at jeans
[1716.84 --> 1717.56]  how denim
[1717.56 --> 1718.48]  changed over the years
[1718.48 --> 1719.38]  current denim
[1719.38 --> 1719.94]  like if you go
[1719.94 --> 1720.90]  buy Levi's
[1720.90 --> 1721.48]  current denim
[1721.48 --> 1722.72]  is not at the same
[1722.72 --> 1723.96]  quality that it used to be
[1723.96 --> 1724.18]  yeah
[1724.18 --> 1724.86]  it's just
[1724.86 --> 1726.52]  like it's weird
[1726.52 --> 1727.14]  to think about that
[1727.14 --> 1727.90]  like back when shoes
[1727.90 --> 1728.60]  were handmade
[1728.60 --> 1729.16]  yeah
[1729.16 --> 1729.96]  when you compare that
[1729.96 --> 1730.66]  to Nike's
[1730.66 --> 1731.28]  that you had to spend
[1731.28 --> 1732.16]  $100 on
[1732.16 --> 1732.76]  I mean do people
[1732.76 --> 1733.62]  buy Nike's anymore
[1733.62 --> 1734.00]  I don't know
[1734.00 --> 1735.04]  but in the 90s anyway
[1735.04 --> 1735.82]  when I was a kid
[1735.82 --> 1737.06]  I'm 100% sure
[1737.06 --> 1737.96]  Nike's are still popular
[1737.96 --> 1738.88]  but the point is
[1738.88 --> 1739.52]  that when
[1739.52 --> 1740.04]  when
[1740.04 --> 1740.92]  what is it
[1740.92 --> 1741.50]  cobbler
[1741.50 --> 1742.42]  cobbler yeah
[1742.42 --> 1743.40]  when a cobbler
[1743.40 --> 1744.20]  made shoes
[1744.20 --> 1745.36]  out of leather
[1745.36 --> 1746.42]  and like stitched
[1746.42 --> 1747.10]  with hide
[1747.10 --> 1748.06]  like those things
[1748.06 --> 1748.84]  were meant
[1748.84 --> 1749.48]  to last
[1749.48 --> 1750.06]  for years
[1750.06 --> 1750.44]  and like bolts
[1750.44 --> 1751.24]  in your soul
[1751.24 --> 1751.50]  yes
[1751.50 --> 1752.54]  they were heavy
[1752.54 --> 1753.30]  they were uncomfortable
[1753.30 --> 1754.24]  but
[1754.24 --> 1755.40]  but they were built
[1755.40 --> 1756.14]  they were built
[1756.14 --> 1756.52]  so anyway
[1756.52 --> 1756.98]  durable
[1756.98 --> 1758.96]  so there's less incentive
[1758.96 --> 1759.98]  for the manufacturers
[1759.98 --> 1761.18]  to keep iterating
[1761.18 --> 1761.80]  on products
[1761.80 --> 1762.84]  that are inherently
[1762.84 --> 1764.08]  expensive to manufacture
[1764.08 --> 1765.02]  so even this case
[1765.02 --> 1766.04]  has been downgraded
[1766.04 --> 1766.96]  since I bought it
[1766.96 --> 1768.46]  this bend right here
[1768.46 --> 1769.72]  is a perfect curve
[1769.72 --> 1770.16]  for me
[1770.16 --> 1771.56]  on the newer versions
[1771.56 --> 1772.18]  of the case
[1772.18 --> 1773.82]  there's a fold
[1773.82 --> 1774.72]  and then a fold
[1774.72 --> 1775.24]  it's subtle
[1775.24 --> 1775.98]  but it's there
[1775.98 --> 1777.16]  if you look on the inside
[1777.16 --> 1778.40]  rather than bending
[1778.40 --> 1779.16]  it out right
[1779.16 --> 1781.06]  Silverstone now
[1781.06 --> 1782.12]  scores it
[1782.12 --> 1782.76]  twice
[1782.76 --> 1783.72]  in order to get
[1783.72 --> 1785.44]  that almost a perfect
[1785.44 --> 1786.82]  not quite a perfect curve
[1786.82 --> 1788.12]  I think that streamlines
[1788.12 --> 1789.04]  the production process
[1789.04 --> 1789.84]  because it makes it easier
[1789.84 --> 1790.20]  to do
[1790.20 --> 1791.12]  and I think it also
[1791.12 --> 1792.10]  makes it more likely
[1792.10 --> 1793.28]  that the side panels
[1793.28 --> 1793.88]  will fit
[1793.88 --> 1794.92]  from case to case
[1794.92 --> 1796.44]  early TJ07s
[1796.44 --> 1797.48]  you could take the side panels
[1797.48 --> 1797.94]  off one
[1797.94 --> 1798.78]  and put them on another one
[1798.78 --> 1799.90]  they just wouldn't even fit
[1799.90 --> 1801.02]  because it was like
[1801.02 --> 1802.46]  custom done pretty much
[1802.46 --> 1802.74]  yeah
[1802.74 --> 1803.70]  um
[1803.70 --> 1804.98]  so
[1804.98 --> 1805.92]  I don't remember
[1805.92 --> 1806.50]  where we were going
[1806.50 --> 1807.00]  with that
[1807.00 --> 1807.56]  oh yeah
[1807.56 --> 1808.28]  will the hardware
[1808.28 --> 1809.74]  will hardware get more expensive
[1809.74 --> 1810.02]  again
[1810.02 --> 1810.96]  I doubt it
[1810.96 --> 1811.88]  I seriously doubt it
[1811.88 --> 1812.32]  but then
[1812.32 --> 1812.86]  because
[1812.86 --> 1813.26]  oh right
[1813.26 --> 1814.38]  because all the PC guys
[1814.38 --> 1814.94]  they just
[1814.94 --> 1816.16]  you have competitors
[1816.16 --> 1817.80]  A, B, C, D, E, F, and G
[1817.80 --> 1819.58]  all driving price down
[1819.58 --> 1821.74]  because they have to hit revenue targets
[1821.74 --> 1823.04]  and the only way to do that
[1823.04 --> 1824.62]  is to drop the price
[1824.62 --> 1827.06]  if you can sell it for half as much
[1827.06 --> 1827.30]  I mean
[1827.30 --> 1828.74]  and you guys can go
[1828.74 --> 1829.40]  oh well they have
[1829.40 --> 1830.36]  so much margin
[1830.36 --> 1831.06]  they make so much money
[1831.06 --> 1832.46]  no they don't
[1832.46 --> 1833.92]  Hynex went out of business
[1833.92 --> 1835.70]  Kimondo went out of business
[1835.70 --> 1837.14]  there's no money in RAM
[1837.14 --> 1837.92]  like
[1837.92 --> 1838.90]  what are you crazy
[1838.90 --> 1840.72]  you can see what the margins are
[1840.72 --> 1841.72]  they're all public companies
[1841.72 --> 1842.70]  there's no money in it
[1842.70 --> 1844.44]  when they drop their price
[1844.44 --> 1846.64]  and sell it below their manufacturing cost
[1846.64 --> 1848.04]  they are dropping their price
[1848.04 --> 1850.02]  and selling below their manufacturing cost
[1850.02 --> 1852.36]  and when they sell below their manufacturing cost
[1852.36 --> 1855.98]  for something that costs billions in R&D
[1855.98 --> 1858.56]  for every new process node shrink
[1858.56 --> 1860.30]  think about that
[1860.30 --> 1861.58]  yeah
[1861.58 --> 1863.02]  they have to ship like
[1863.02 --> 1865.94]  containers on containers of this stuff
[1865.94 --> 1867.10]  and it's RAM
[1867.10 --> 1868.66]  and when you're at a loss
[1868.66 --> 1871.14]  you don't get to make it up in volume anymore
[1871.14 --> 1871.94]  so
[1871.94 --> 1873.26]  so yeah
[1873.26 --> 1873.80]  no I
[1873.80 --> 1874.64]  I don't know
[1874.64 --> 1875.78]  but they do it to themselves
[1875.78 --> 1877.10]  time and time and time again
[1877.10 --> 1877.46]  so
[1877.46 --> 1878.68]  I don't think they'll learn
[1878.68 --> 1880.52]  uh
[1880.52 --> 1881.62]  got up at 6am
[1881.62 --> 1882.02]  yeah
[1882.02 --> 1885.08]  Chris wants to know if we're live yet
[1885.08 --> 1885.40]  yes
[1885.40 --> 1885.68]  no
[1885.68 --> 1886.52]  no
[1886.52 --> 1887.40]  no we're not here
[1887.40 --> 1888.40]  no we're not here
[1888.40 --> 1889.12]  go away
[1889.12 --> 1889.52]  yep
[1889.52 --> 1892.16]  have you heard about this
[1892.16 --> 1892.60]  no
[1892.60 --> 1893.86]  I should have had this on the news
[1893.86 --> 1894.24]  I didn't
[1894.24 --> 1896.12]  when I saw him say that
[1896.12 --> 1896.40]  I was like
[1896.40 --> 1897.36]  oh yeah
[1897.36 --> 1898.20]  oh
[1898.20 --> 1899.16]  it should have been on the news
[1899.16 --> 1900.88]  well Portal basically was a movie
[1900.88 --> 1902.88]  Portal would make a sweet movie
[1902.88 --> 1903.40]  and Halfway
[1903.40 --> 1905.02]  they're both pretty much movies
[1905.02 --> 1905.72]  yeah pretty much
[1905.72 --> 1906.86]  so like
[1906.86 --> 1907.78]  do it
[1907.78 --> 1908.78]  I'm stoked
[1908.78 --> 1909.80]  I actually like
[1909.80 --> 1911.02]  you both
[1911.02 --> 1911.74]  as the director
[1911.74 --> 1913.22]  uh
[1913.22 --> 1913.80]  wasn't it
[1913.80 --> 1914.52]  uh
[1914.52 --> 1915.72]  no no
[1915.72 --> 1916.62]  I mean I think you should be
[1916.62 --> 1917.62]  oh
[1917.62 --> 1922.32]  yeah
[1922.32 --> 1924.32]  um
[1924.32 --> 1924.86]  I think
[1924.86 --> 1926.42]  I think he's talking to JJ Abrams
[1926.42 --> 1927.44]  oh
[1927.44 --> 1928.02]  legitimately
[1928.02 --> 1930.08]  I think he's talking to JJ Abrams
[1930.08 --> 1930.52]  I read that
[1930.52 --> 1931.20]  I'd be down for that
[1931.20 --> 1931.94]  yeah
[1931.94 --> 1932.76]  no like seriously
[1932.76 --> 1934.10]  that would be sweet
[1934.10 --> 1935.36]  that would be friggin awesome
[1935.36 --> 1936.24]  and it's Gabe Newell
[1936.24 --> 1937.94]  if he really wants JJ Abrams
[1937.94 --> 1939.58]  he can probably get JJ Abrams
[1939.58 --> 1941.12]  like
[1941.12 --> 1942.86]  probably eat JJ Abrams
[1942.86 --> 1944.08]  it's
[1944.08 --> 1944.90]  no
[1944.90 --> 1945.96]  I like Gabe
[1945.96 --> 1947.10]  me too
[1947.10 --> 1949.18]  okay
[1949.18 --> 1949.54]  douche
[1949.54 --> 1950.86]  he's still fat
[1950.86 --> 1953.86]  what was I gonna say
[1953.86 --> 1954.68]  I had something to say
[1954.68 --> 1955.30]  he's brilliant
[1955.30 --> 1958.44]  one of my favorite visionaries
[1958.44 --> 1959.12]  of our time
[1959.12 --> 1960.36]  he's crazy
[1960.36 --> 1961.26]  you gotta watch that
[1961.26 --> 1962.24]  uh presentation
[1962.24 --> 1963.06]  eats babies
[1963.06 --> 1965.74]  you gotta watch his business
[1965.74 --> 1966.20]  presentation
[1966.20 --> 1966.92]  it's really good
[1966.92 --> 1968.14]  alright
[1968.14 --> 1969.86]  James asks
[1969.86 --> 1970.86]  do you think that
[1970.86 --> 1971.64]  current games
[1971.64 --> 1972.56]  or those coming out
[1972.56 --> 1973.22]  will be able to
[1973.22 --> 1974.18]  fully utilize
[1974.18 --> 1975.00]  the increased power
[1975.00 --> 1976.62]  of the GTX 700 series
[1976.62 --> 1977.46]  GPUs
[1977.46 --> 1978.56]  um
[1978.56 --> 1979.48]  okay well let's tie this
[1979.48 --> 1980.28]  into a couple things
[1980.28 --> 1981.52]  if you guys don't already
[1981.52 --> 1982.20]  know about it
[1982.20 --> 1983.60]  basically go buy an AMD
[1983.60 --> 1984.84]  graphics card right now
[1984.84 --> 1985.52]  uh
[1985.52 --> 1986.62]  what games are they doing
[1986.62 --> 1987.44]  so they have another
[1987.44 --> 1988.40]  never settle bundle
[1988.40 --> 1990.74]  for 7900 series
[1990.74 --> 1991.58]  you get
[1991.58 --> 1992.56]  Crysis 3
[1992.56 --> 1993.56]  and
[1993.56 --> 1994.26]  Bioshock
[1994.26 --> 1995.22]  Bioshock Infinite
[1995.22 --> 1997.74]  and for 7800 series
[1997.74 --> 1998.34]  you get
[1998.34 --> 1999.46]  Bioshock Infinite
[1999.46 --> 2000.26]  and Tomb Raider
[2000.26 --> 2001.48]  so my understanding is
[2001.48 --> 2002.26]  Bioshock Infinite
[2002.26 --> 2003.12]  is supposed to be
[2003.12 --> 2004.56]  not a steaming pile
[2004.56 --> 2005.62]  of um
[2005.62 --> 2006.26]  it's a game
[2006.26 --> 2007.64]  complete revamp
[2007.64 --> 2009.02]  like Bioshock 2 was
[2009.02 --> 2009.42]  yeah
[2009.42 --> 2010.26]  Bioshock 1
[2010.26 --> 2010.78]  I loved
[2010.78 --> 2011.42]  Bioshock 2
[2011.42 --> 2012.08]  I made it through like
[2012.08 --> 2012.62]  10 minutes
[2012.62 --> 2013.20]  and I was just like
[2013.20 --> 2013.90]  this is stupid
[2013.90 --> 2014.82]  because of him
[2014.82 --> 2016.16]  I played Bioshock 1
[2016.16 --> 2017.52]  and even though I have it
[2017.52 --> 2017.82]  just
[2017.82 --> 2018.68]  nope
[2018.68 --> 2019.66]  not playing Bioshock 2
[2019.66 --> 2020.24]  no it's not worth it
[2020.24 --> 2020.90]  I just don't want to
[2020.90 --> 2021.28]  ruin it for myself
[2021.28 --> 2022.28]  so I'm super stoked
[2022.28 --> 2023.20]  on Bioshock Infinite
[2023.20 --> 2024.26]  I hope
[2024.26 --> 2025.88]  I'm cautiously optimistic
[2025.88 --> 2026.92]  I wouldn't pre-order it
[2026.92 --> 2027.56]  after my
[2027.56 --> 2028.66]  I pre-ordered Bioshock 2
[2028.66 --> 2029.22]  for those of you
[2029.22 --> 2030.06]  who don't know that
[2030.06 --> 2030.86]  um
[2030.86 --> 2032.22]  but I'm super stoked
[2032.22 --> 2032.70]  on Infinite
[2032.70 --> 2033.96]  and Crysis 3
[2033.96 --> 2035.26]  I am just
[2035.26 --> 2036.06]  like
[2036.06 --> 2036.52]  ugh
[2036.52 --> 2037.38]  awesome
[2037.38 --> 2037.92]  oh
[2037.92 --> 2038.58]  I'm so
[2038.58 --> 2039.84]  I'm so excited about
[2039.84 --> 2040.94]  they've continuously
[2040.94 --> 2041.74]  released quality
[2041.74 --> 2042.34]  yep
[2042.34 --> 2043.16]  yep
[2043.16 --> 2043.88]  I mean
[2043.88 --> 2045.00]  Crysis was awesome
[2045.00 --> 2046.06]  Crysis is one of the few
[2046.06 --> 2046.88]  FPS games
[2046.88 --> 2047.64]  that I've actually played
[2047.64 --> 2048.38]  all the way through
[2048.38 --> 2049.54]  a reasonably long
[2049.54 --> 2050.44]  story mode campaign
[2050.44 --> 2050.72]  yeah
[2050.72 --> 2051.54]  just because mostly
[2051.54 --> 2052.54]  I kind of lose patience
[2052.54 --> 2052.90]  with it
[2052.90 --> 2053.46]  and I'm just like
[2053.46 --> 2054.66]  oh whatever
[2054.66 --> 2055.64]  this hallway is kind of
[2055.64 --> 2056.16]  hard to get through
[2056.16 --> 2056.94]  I don't care anymore
[2056.94 --> 2058.42]  Warhead I wasn't as interested
[2058.42 --> 2059.40]  I didn't play Warhead
[2059.40 --> 2059.76]  sorry
[2059.76 --> 2060.28]  actually
[2060.28 --> 2061.20]  no I didn't play Warhead
[2061.20 --> 2062.36]  I did a little bit of it
[2062.36 --> 2063.30]  and then was like
[2063.30 --> 2063.76]  nah
[2063.76 --> 2064.80]  I heard it was just
[2064.80 --> 2065.66]  kind of the same game
[2065.66 --> 2065.98]  yeah
[2065.98 --> 2067.08]  that's why I wasn't
[2067.08 --> 2067.44]  as interested
[2067.44 --> 2068.56]  but Crysis 1 was epic
[2068.56 --> 2070.22]  and Crysis 2 was really good
[2070.22 --> 2070.72]  nothing
[2070.72 --> 2071.76]  neither of them were as good
[2071.76 --> 2072.48]  as Far Cry though
[2072.48 --> 2073.70]  Far Cry 3 is just like
[2073.70 --> 2074.72]  oh I haven't played
[2074.72 --> 2075.30]  Far Cry 3
[2075.30 --> 2076.54]  I mean Far Cry 1
[2076.54 --> 2077.74]  one of the first things
[2077.74 --> 2078.12]  you have to do
[2078.12 --> 2078.92]  once this is built
[2078.92 --> 2079.90]  is play Far Cry 3
[2079.90 --> 2080.50]  seriously
[2080.50 --> 2080.84]  okay
[2080.84 --> 2081.74]  like seriously
[2081.74 --> 2082.44]  okay alright alright
[2082.44 --> 2083.10]  alright done
[2083.10 --> 2083.80]  um
[2083.80 --> 2085.10]  I will play Far Cry 3
[2085.10 --> 2085.62]  good
[2085.62 --> 2086.70]  it's honestly like
[2086.70 --> 2087.74]  really really really fun
[2087.74 --> 2089.08]  I will run okay on my
[2089.08 --> 2089.50]  on my
[2089.50 --> 2091.22]  people keep making fun of me
[2091.22 --> 2092.22]  for my graphics card
[2092.22 --> 2093.02]  what is up with that
[2093.02 --> 2095.18]  just because it's not current gen
[2095.18 --> 2096.62]  so what
[2096.62 --> 2097.60]  I just
[2097.60 --> 2098.44]  I'm explaining
[2098.44 --> 2101.32]  so what it's not current gen
[2101.32 --> 2101.88]  I'm not the one
[2101.88 --> 2102.68]  making fun of you
[2102.68 --> 2103.86]  what is there to make fun of
[2103.86 --> 2105.06]  about this graphics card
[2105.06 --> 2107.06]  this is a GTX 590
[2107.06 --> 2107.70]  you know what
[2107.70 --> 2109.00]  it's as fast
[2109.00 --> 2109.90]  if not faster
[2109.90 --> 2110.72]  than a 680
[2110.72 --> 2113.02]  and it looks awesome
[2113.02 --> 2114.30]  it's got like
[2114.30 --> 2115.62]  glowing lights on it
[2115.62 --> 2116.12]  it's water cool
[2116.12 --> 2116.52]  and it's like a
[2116.52 --> 2118.28]  sweet water block
[2118.28 --> 2119.62]  it's kind of like
[2119.62 --> 2120.66]  the best water block
[2120.66 --> 2121.18]  actually
[2121.18 --> 2122.50]  it's so beast
[2122.50 --> 2122.94]  awesome
[2122.94 --> 2123.40]  anyway
[2123.40 --> 2124.34]  so this will be going
[2124.34 --> 2124.90]  in my rig
[2124.90 --> 2125.82]  and like this is cool
[2125.82 --> 2126.46]  that's what's actually
[2126.46 --> 2127.18]  going to show
[2127.18 --> 2127.98]  when you put it in your system
[2127.98 --> 2128.76]  I'm not going to show them that
[2128.76 --> 2130.52]  so there's like a glowing
[2130.52 --> 2132.14]  light on the side of it
[2132.14 --> 2132.88]  you can see where that
[2132.88 --> 2134.02]  little silver logo is
[2134.02 --> 2136.02]  so I've got my silver compressions in there
[2136.02 --> 2138.36]  show them what they're actually going to see
[2138.36 --> 2138.84]  there we go
[2138.84 --> 2139.74]  there's the backplate
[2139.74 --> 2141.62]  absolutely gorgeous
[2141.62 --> 2142.96]  brushed aluminum backplate
[2142.96 --> 2144.50]  that I've never once touched
[2144.50 --> 2146.50]  so it doesn't have any stains on it
[2146.50 --> 2148.32]  that's the way to go
[2148.32 --> 2149.50]  okay
[2149.50 --> 2150.46]  so back to
[2150.46 --> 2152.22]  so the Never Settle bundle
[2152.22 --> 2153.28]  looks friggin awesome
[2153.28 --> 2156.08]  but back to GTX 700 series cards
[2156.08 --> 2156.98]  Crysis 3
[2156.98 --> 2159.10]  I think is going to be the one
[2159.10 --> 2161.18]  look at the requirements for it
[2161.18 --> 2162.14]  look how it's running
[2162.14 --> 2164.96]  in alpha on current generation cards
[2164.96 --> 2166.96]  Crysis 3 is going to be the next
[2166.96 --> 2169.02]  can it run Crysis 3
[2169.02 --> 2169.36]  stoked
[2169.36 --> 2169.98]  3
[2169.98 --> 2170.74]  stoked
[2170.74 --> 2172.26]  I love it when there's stuff like that
[2172.26 --> 2173.46]  my favorite period
[2173.46 --> 2175.02]  in like PC building
[2175.02 --> 2175.86]  and PC modding
[2175.86 --> 2176.58]  was Crysis 1
[2176.58 --> 2177.22]  yep
[2177.22 --> 2178.20]  that was like
[2178.20 --> 2179.20]  oh my god
[2179.20 --> 2180.38]  like everything just exploded
[2180.38 --> 2181.18]  everyone like
[2181.18 --> 2182.36]  forums and everything
[2182.36 --> 2182.80]  was just like
[2182.80 --> 2184.52]  because it bent over your system
[2184.52 --> 2186.60]  and then a new generation
[2186.60 --> 2187.52]  of graphics cards
[2187.52 --> 2188.46]  would conquer it
[2188.46 --> 2189.68]  and then a new like
[2189.68 --> 2191.28]  high res texture mod
[2191.28 --> 2191.90]  would come out
[2191.90 --> 2192.38]  it was just like
[2192.38 --> 2192.84]  no
[2192.84 --> 2194.72]  no
[2194.72 --> 2195.72]  no
[2195.72 --> 2196.32]  no
[2196.32 --> 2197.56]  sit
[2197.56 --> 2198.18]  bad
[2198.18 --> 2199.72]  so uh
[2199.72 --> 2200.18]  awesome
[2200.18 --> 2200.56]  yeah
[2200.56 --> 2201.44]  that was so awesome
[2201.44 --> 2202.60]  I'm looking forward to having
[2202.60 --> 2204.10]  some justification
[2204.10 --> 2206.22]  to own a high end PC
[2206.22 --> 2206.72]  again
[2206.72 --> 2207.98]  well like
[2207.98 --> 2209.00]  that's what everyone
[2209.00 --> 2209.96]  kind of did
[2209.96 --> 2210.48]  was they're like
[2210.48 --> 2212.34]  oh I can't run Crysis optimally
[2212.34 --> 2213.76]  time to upgrade
[2213.76 --> 2215.14]  time to finally get
[2215.14 --> 2216.38]  super enthusiastic
[2216.38 --> 2216.84]  about building
[2216.84 --> 2217.36]  time to like
[2217.36 --> 2218.56]  overclock my machine
[2218.56 --> 2219.56]  that I've been sitting here
[2219.56 --> 2220.76]  with it not overclocked
[2220.76 --> 2221.66]  because it doesn't matter
[2221.66 --> 2222.24]  six months
[2222.24 --> 2223.22]  because who cares
[2223.22 --> 2224.20]  I can't tell the difference
[2224.20 --> 2226.08]  between 55 FPS
[2226.08 --> 2227.32]  and 59 FPS
[2227.32 --> 2227.76]  whereas
[2227.76 --> 2229.52]  you can tell the difference
[2229.52 --> 2231.20]  between 24 and 29
[2231.20 --> 2232.02]  oh completely
[2232.02 --> 2232.94]  you can tell the difference
[2232.94 --> 2234.78]  between like 24 and 26
[2234.78 --> 2235.36]  yeah
[2235.36 --> 2236.46]  night and day
[2236.46 --> 2237.08]  so that's
[2237.08 --> 2237.36]  uh
[2237.36 --> 2238.08]  oh
[2238.08 --> 2238.90]  it's exciting
[2238.90 --> 2239.48]  so yes
[2239.48 --> 2240.82]  I do believe
[2240.82 --> 2241.44]  there's hope
[2241.44 --> 2242.16]  for
[2242.16 --> 2243.86]  at least for the near term
[2243.86 --> 2244.70]  PC gaming
[2244.70 --> 2246.46]  um
[2246.46 --> 2247.02]  Slick
[2247.02 --> 2247.62]  do you like the new
[2247.62 --> 2248.36]  ranked system in League
[2248.36 --> 2248.78]  okay
[2248.78 --> 2249.58]  we're moving on
[2249.58 --> 2250.10]  uh
[2250.10 --> 2251.12]  was Slick a part of the
[2251.12 --> 2252.20]  battle of Asakai
[2252.20 --> 2253.92]  yes
[2253.92 --> 2254.58]  hi
[2254.58 --> 2255.68]  I have a Microsoft Surface
[2255.68 --> 2256.70]  and do you know
[2256.70 --> 2258.68]  if I can put iTunes on it
[2258.68 --> 2259.80]  probably not
[2259.80 --> 2260.12]  no
[2260.12 --> 2260.70]  no you can't
[2260.70 --> 2261.80]  don't put iTunes on anything
[2261.80 --> 2262.82]  pro tip
[2262.82 --> 2264.08]  did you fire Slick yet
[2264.08 --> 2265.36]  um
[2265.36 --> 2266.06]  no actually
[2266.06 --> 2266.74]  I haven't fired him
[2266.74 --> 2267.48]  he hasn't done anything
[2267.48 --> 2268.72]  particularly horrible yet
[2268.72 --> 2270.24]  will Slick ever have
[2270.24 --> 2270.86]  a new jacket
[2270.86 --> 2271.94]  also don't forget
[2271.94 --> 2272.78]  the Windows 8 giveaway
[2272.78 --> 2273.60]  okay we won't forget
[2273.60 --> 2274.46]  the Windows 8 giveaway
[2274.46 --> 2275.34]  um
[2275.34 --> 2276.74]  new jacket
[2276.74 --> 2277.34]  show the video
[2277.34 --> 2278.22]  perfect segue
[2278.22 --> 2279.04]  okay
[2279.04 --> 2279.50]  alright
[2279.50 --> 2280.10]  it's not a new jacket
[2280.10 --> 2281.20]  no we're not playing the video
[2281.20 --> 2281.92]  we're not
[2281.92 --> 2283.12]  no they can't see the video
[2283.12 --> 2283.84]  oh but then
[2283.84 --> 2284.56]  what were you gonna do
[2284.56 --> 2285.38]  I was just gonna show them
[2285.38 --> 2285.88]  the screenshot
[2285.88 --> 2286.46]  for those of you
[2286.46 --> 2287.64]  who aren't following on Twitter
[2287.64 --> 2288.08]  alright
[2288.08 --> 2289.84]  yeah sorry guys
[2289.84 --> 2290.76]  we can't share this video
[2290.76 --> 2291.46]  with you yet
[2291.46 --> 2292.58]  it is still
[2292.58 --> 2293.02]  uh
[2293.02 --> 2294.28]  it's still under embargo
[2294.28 --> 2295.08]  for another
[2295.08 --> 2296.72]  I think seven days or so
[2296.72 --> 2297.02]  but
[2297.02 --> 2298.10]  this is something
[2298.10 --> 2298.96]  that Slick
[2298.96 --> 2299.90]  and Diesel
[2299.90 --> 2300.44]  and I
[2300.44 --> 2301.16]  have been
[2301.16 --> 2302.36]  working on
[2302.36 --> 2303.56]  extremely hard
[2303.56 --> 2304.50]  and we are
[2304.50 --> 2305.94]  extremely excited about
[2305.94 --> 2306.86]  so um
[2306.86 --> 2307.94]  I hope you guys
[2307.94 --> 2308.80]  can see this
[2308.80 --> 2309.64]  I think they can see it
[2309.64 --> 2309.80]  right
[2309.80 --> 2310.58]  I don't know if you're
[2310.58 --> 2311.22]  on the right thing
[2311.22 --> 2312.00]  I'll make sure
[2312.00 --> 2312.76]  it's on the right thing
[2312.76 --> 2314.40]  so this is a freeze
[2314.40 --> 2315.64]  this is a still frame
[2315.64 --> 2317.30]  of an upcoming
[2317.30 --> 2317.84]  uh
[2317.84 --> 2318.70]  this is going on
[2318.70 --> 2319.98]  the Tech Quickie channel
[2319.98 --> 2321.94]  so this is a project
[2321.94 --> 2322.84]  that we're producing
[2322.84 --> 2324.52]  for um
[2324.52 --> 2325.70]  you know what
[2325.70 --> 2326.34]  we might as well say
[2326.34 --> 2326.78]  who it's for
[2326.78 --> 2327.46]  because it'll be pretty
[2327.46 --> 2328.46]  obvious based on
[2328.46 --> 2329.36]  the headset I'm wearing
[2329.36 --> 2329.70]  yeah
[2329.70 --> 2330.64]  so that's a
[2330.64 --> 2332.02]  that's a Corsair headset
[2332.02 --> 2332.76]  that is
[2332.76 --> 2333.54]  you know it's blurry
[2333.54 --> 2334.40]  so you guys probably
[2334.40 --> 2335.22]  can't tell exactly
[2335.22 --> 2335.92]  which one it is
[2335.92 --> 2336.68]  but don't worry about it
[2336.68 --> 2337.12]  too much
[2337.12 --> 2339.14]  so this is a video project
[2339.14 --> 2339.76]  we're producing
[2339.76 --> 2340.88]  for Corsair
[2340.88 --> 2342.30]  for this headset
[2342.30 --> 2343.54]  that um
[2343.54 --> 2344.68]  we are just
[2344.68 --> 2345.96]  super excited about
[2345.96 --> 2346.74]  the video is only
[2346.74 --> 2347.30]  about a minute
[2347.30 --> 2348.42]  a minute and a half long
[2348.42 --> 2350.22]  but the sheer amount
[2350.22 --> 2351.04]  of epicness
[2351.04 --> 2351.46]  okay
[2351.46 --> 2353.04]  I took a lot of flack
[2353.04 --> 2354.40]  for buying an FS700
[2354.40 --> 2355.92]  which is an
[2355.92 --> 2357.78]  $8,700
[2357.78 --> 2358.62]  $8,600
[2358.62 --> 2359.44]  basically it's a
[2359.44 --> 2360.70]  $9,000 camera
[2360.70 --> 2360.94]  plus kit
[2360.94 --> 2362.66]  plus all the
[2362.66 --> 2363.26]  yeah
[2363.26 --> 2363.86]  oh right
[2363.86 --> 2364.54]  plus the lights
[2364.54 --> 2364.90]  were another
[2364.90 --> 2365.62]  three grand
[2365.62 --> 2366.12]  plus
[2366.12 --> 2366.58]  plus
[2366.58 --> 2366.92]  plus
[2366.92 --> 2367.20]  plus
[2367.20 --> 2367.50]  plus
[2367.50 --> 2367.84]  plus the mic
[2367.84 --> 2368.80]  plus the new
[2368.80 --> 2369.24]  standard
[2369.24 --> 2369.56]  oh
[2369.56 --> 2369.98]  that was a
[2369.98 --> 2370.32]  plus the
[2370.32 --> 2370.86]  oh that was a lot
[2370.86 --> 2371.24]  of money
[2371.24 --> 2371.88]  plus the
[2371.88 --> 2372.62]  okay you know what
[2372.62 --> 2373.50]  shut up man
[2373.50 --> 2374.92]  shut up man
[2374.92 --> 2375.70]  you're killing me
[2375.70 --> 2376.56]  basically you're poor
[2376.56 --> 2376.84]  now
[2376.84 --> 2377.64]  basically I'm poor
[2377.64 --> 2378.06]  now yes
[2378.06 --> 2379.34]  so I had a lot of
[2379.34 --> 2379.94]  people giving me a
[2379.94 --> 2380.78]  hard time about this
[2380.78 --> 2384.50]  this video is why I did
[2384.50 --> 2385.66]  this because
[2385.66 --> 2386.84]  and it shows
[2386.84 --> 2387.36]  yes
[2387.36 --> 2388.16]  like it's actually
[2388.16 --> 2388.68]  legendary
[2388.68 --> 2390.10]  oh we shot so much
[2390.10 --> 2391.74]  of it at 240 fps
[2391.74 --> 2393.44]  so it's like
[2393.44 --> 2394.48]  like every
[2394.48 --> 2395.68]  like that still frame
[2395.68 --> 2396.42]  you saw there
[2396.42 --> 2397.68]  was like a crappy
[2397.68 --> 2399.26]  capture off of
[2399.26 --> 2399.98]  playing the low
[2399.98 --> 2401.06]  low res version
[2401.06 --> 2401.82]  no no
[2401.82 --> 2402.54]  in its full
[2402.54 --> 2403.86]  1080p glory
[2403.86 --> 2405.30]  in super slow
[2405.30 --> 2405.60]  mo
[2405.60 --> 2406.82]  with water drip
[2406.82 --> 2408.40]  like falling
[2408.40 --> 2409.30]  off the headset
[2409.30 --> 2410.52]  in slow motion
[2410.52 --> 2411.18]  because it's
[2411.18 --> 2412.34]  actually raining
[2412.34 --> 2412.90]  in the sea
[2412.90 --> 2413.24]  yeah
[2413.24 --> 2413.92]  like we
[2413.92 --> 2414.34]  we didn't
[2414.34 --> 2415.40]  like hose it
[2415.40 --> 2415.96]  like we were
[2415.96 --> 2417.02]  actually completely
[2417.02 --> 2417.48]  soaked
[2417.48 --> 2418.28]  it was kind of
[2418.28 --> 2418.62]  uncomfortable
[2418.62 --> 2419.38]  yeah
[2419.38 --> 2420.74]  but it looks good
[2420.74 --> 2421.26]  yeah but it
[2421.26 --> 2421.74]  looked good
[2421.74 --> 2423.08]  and so therefore
[2423.08 --> 2423.76]  it is totally
[2423.76 --> 2424.40]  worth it
[2424.40 --> 2426.42]  yeah we're
[2426.42 --> 2426.98]  really excited
[2426.98 --> 2427.38]  about this
[2427.38 --> 2428.06]  so that actually
[2428.06 --> 2428.94]  leads us into
[2428.94 --> 2429.76]  a discussion
[2429.76 --> 2430.48]  topic that
[2430.48 --> 2431.24]  I would like
[2431.24 --> 2431.96]  to that I
[2431.96 --> 2432.24]  would like
[2432.24 --> 2432.90]  to talk about
[2432.90 --> 2436.36]  so for those
[2436.36 --> 2436.74]  of you
[2436.74 --> 2437.26]  I guess I
[2437.26 --> 2438.24]  haven't really
[2438.24 --> 2439.00]  addressed this
[2439.00 --> 2439.34]  we're gonna
[2439.34 --> 2440.22]  sort of talk
[2440.22 --> 2440.58]  about this
[2440.58 --> 2440.88]  on twitter
[2440.88 --> 2441.22]  for a bit
[2441.22 --> 2441.70]  so guys
[2441.70 --> 2442.92]  do not tweet
[2442.92 --> 2443.58]  anything
[2443.58 --> 2444.74]  that is not
[2444.74 --> 2445.56]  about the thing
[2445.56 --> 2445.96]  that we're gonna
[2445.96 --> 2446.58]  talk about right
[2446.58 --> 2446.76]  now
[2446.76 --> 2447.14]  what's this
[2447.14 --> 2447.42]  what's this
[2447.42 --> 2448.06]  I could've got you
[2448.06 --> 2449.30]  never bring a sword
[2449.30 --> 2450.14]  to a gun fight
[2450.14 --> 2450.40]  slick
[2450.40 --> 2451.32]  actually when you
[2451.32 --> 2451.92]  guys watch the
[2451.92 --> 2452.60]  video you're gonna
[2452.60 --> 2453.80]  see that the
[2453.80 --> 2455.48]  15 to 20 feet
[2455.48 --> 2456.66]  he closes it
[2456.66 --> 2457.36]  fast enough
[2457.36 --> 2458.10]  that if I didn't
[2458.10 --> 2458.62]  if we hadn't
[2458.62 --> 2459.16]  rehearsed it
[2459.16 --> 2459.70]  if I didn't know
[2459.70 --> 2460.22]  he was coming
[2460.22 --> 2460.58]  he'd have
[2460.58 --> 2461.78]  probably gotten me
[2461.78 --> 2465.64]  okay okay here
[2465.64 --> 2466.24]  we'll do a couple
[2466.24 --> 2467.04]  more twitter questions
[2467.04 --> 2467.62]  and then we'll move
[2467.62 --> 2469.24]  into why exactly
[2469.24 --> 2470.16]  we're making a video
[2470.16 --> 2471.04]  for corsair
[2471.04 --> 2471.48]  so
[2471.48 --> 2474.40]  never bring a sword
[2474.40 --> 2475.28]  to a gun fight
[2475.28 --> 2476.40]  build a water
[2476.40 --> 2476.94]  cooling system
[2476.94 --> 2477.58]  as a reference
[2477.58 --> 2478.30]  and then only swap
[2478.30 --> 2478.96]  in one part
[2478.96 --> 2479.46]  so we can get
[2479.46 --> 2479.96]  graphs over
[2479.96 --> 2480.70]  which part is best
[2480.70 --> 2481.90]  the best way
[2481.90 --> 2482.68]  to actually test
[2482.68 --> 2483.20]  water cooling
[2483.20 --> 2483.88]  components against
[2483.88 --> 2484.26]  each other
[2484.26 --> 2485.02]  is in a controlled
[2485.02 --> 2485.48]  environment
[2485.48 --> 2486.44]  and unfortunately
[2486.44 --> 2487.16]  a system
[2487.16 --> 2487.88]  is not a
[2487.88 --> 2488.58]  controlled environment
[2488.58 --> 2489.30]  you need to take
[2489.30 --> 2490.54]  you need to
[2490.54 --> 2491.48]  get pressure curves
[2491.48 --> 2492.06]  you need to get
[2492.06 --> 2492.74]  flow rates
[2492.74 --> 2493.32]  you need to get
[2493.32 --> 2494.64]  thermal transfer
[2494.64 --> 2496.14]  at given flow rates
[2496.14 --> 2497.12]  it's very complicated
[2497.12 --> 2497.78]  stuff and there's
[2497.78 --> 2498.70]  probably only
[2498.70 --> 2499.92]  a handful
[2499.92 --> 2501.76]  of liquid cooling
[2501.76 --> 2502.28]  guys
[2502.28 --> 2503.92]  and so skinny labs
[2503.92 --> 2504.68]  and then probably
[2504.68 --> 2505.68]  swift tech
[2505.68 --> 2506.78]  are the only ones
[2506.78 --> 2507.40]  I can think of
[2507.40 --> 2508.34]  that have proper
[2508.34 --> 2508.96]  year to test
[2508.96 --> 2509.82]  water cooling stuff
[2509.82 --> 2511.20]  I know you said
[2511.20 --> 2511.54]  it before
[2511.54 --> 2512.12]  but what headphones
[2512.12 --> 2512.58]  do you use
[2512.58 --> 2513.78]  steel series 7h
[2513.78 --> 2515.78]  dual 570s
[2515.78 --> 2516.32]  or go with a
[2516.32 --> 2517.42]  single 600 series
[2517.42 --> 2519.20]  you know what
[2519.20 --> 2519.86]  dropping in another
[2519.86 --> 2520.44]  570s
[2520.44 --> 2521.14]  not a bad bet
[2521.14 --> 2521.90]  600 series
[2521.90 --> 2523.62]  was a small
[2523.62 --> 2524.12]  iteration
[2524.12 --> 2526.82]  not a major
[2526.82 --> 2527.76]  architecture change
[2527.76 --> 2529.08]  do you think
[2529.08 --> 2529.88]  8 SSDs
[2529.88 --> 2530.42]  is a good idea
[2530.42 --> 2530.70]  no
[2530.70 --> 2531.44]  because the
[2531.44 --> 2532.18]  onboard LSI
[2532.18 --> 2532.66]  controller
[2532.66 --> 2533.60]  is not bootable
[2533.60 --> 2534.06]  if I recall
[2534.06 --> 2534.30]  oh no
[2534.30 --> 2534.96]  I think it is
[2534.96 --> 2535.88]  but it's
[2535.88 --> 2537.16]  limited in terms
[2537.16 --> 2537.84]  of the maximum
[2537.84 --> 2538.24]  throughput
[2538.24 --> 2539.58]  and if you put
[2539.58 --> 2540.44]  8 SSDs on it
[2540.44 --> 2540.74]  you're going to
[2540.74 --> 2541.50]  just destroy that
[2541.50 --> 2541.76]  max
[2541.76 --> 2542.18]  get yourself
[2542.18 --> 2542.92]  a real raid card
[2542.92 --> 2544.50]  what's your
[2544.50 --> 2545.04]  favorite gaming
[2545.04 --> 2545.50]  motherboard
[2545.50 --> 2546.60]  any motherboard
[2546.60 --> 2548.78]  well okay
[2548.78 --> 2549.22]  I shouldn't say
[2549.22 --> 2549.50]  that
[2549.50 --> 2550.40]  if I had to
[2550.40 --> 2551.16]  pick a favorite
[2551.16 --> 2551.90]  motherboard for
[2551.90 --> 2552.24]  gaming
[2552.24 --> 2552.86]  the things that
[2552.86 --> 2553.52]  I care about
[2553.52 --> 2553.94]  for gaming
[2553.94 --> 2554.52]  are things like
[2554.52 --> 2555.14]  better sound
[2555.14 --> 2556.68]  things like
[2556.68 --> 2557.40]  cool looks
[2557.40 --> 2560.78]  you care too
[2560.78 --> 2561.12]  whatever
[2561.12 --> 2561.90]  yeah no I
[2561.90 --> 2562.38]  wasn't even
[2562.38 --> 2562.86]  hating on that
[2562.86 --> 2563.12]  at all
[2563.12 --> 2564.02]  looks totally
[2564.02 --> 2564.30]  magic
[2564.30 --> 2565.04]  I like having
[2565.04 --> 2565.30]  you know
[2565.30 --> 2566.08]  Intel LAN
[2566.08 --> 2567.04]  like no frills
[2567.04 --> 2567.84]  sort of no
[2567.84 --> 2568.50]  random extra
[2568.50 --> 2569.20]  software that I
[2569.20 --> 2569.62]  have to run
[2569.62 --> 2570.70]  to make things
[2570.70 --> 2570.92]  work
[2570.92 --> 2571.50]  I like having
[2571.50 --> 2572.16]  fan control
[2572.16 --> 2573.62]  like with all
[2573.62 --> 2574.34]  these things in
[2574.34 --> 2575.08]  mind I'd probably
[2575.08 --> 2575.52]  go with something
[2575.52 --> 2576.32]  like an m power
[2576.32 --> 2577.30]  or something like
[2577.30 --> 2579.18]  Maximus 5 formula
[2579.18 --> 2579.90]  yeah
[2579.90 --> 2580.48]  yeah
[2580.48 --> 2582.66]  best fan bearing
[2582.66 --> 2583.04]  type
[2583.04 --> 2583.94]  I don't know
[2583.94 --> 2584.58]  whatever Noctua
[2584.58 --> 2585.14]  uses because
[2585.14 --> 2585.84]  holy crap
[2585.84 --> 2588.50]  why when I
[2588.50 --> 2588.90]  download the
[2588.90 --> 2589.52]  Crysis 3 beta
[2589.52 --> 2590.00]  I launch it
[2590.00 --> 2590.28]  and all I see
[2590.28 --> 2590.66]  is a black
[2590.66 --> 2591.04]  screen with
[2591.04 --> 2591.62]  the mouse cursor
[2591.62 --> 2592.20]  origin
[2592.20 --> 2592.92]  let's just be
[2592.92 --> 2594.00]  done with that
[2594.00 --> 2594.52]  origin
[2594.52 --> 2597.16]  watching live
[2597.16 --> 2597.62]  for the first
[2597.62 --> 2598.04]  time ever
[2598.04 --> 2599.16]  yay Sean Brogan
[2599.16 --> 2599.66]  yeah
[2599.66 --> 2600.48]  I kind of
[2600.48 --> 2600.96]  read that as
[2600.96 --> 2601.60]  Seth Rogen
[2601.60 --> 2602.32]  and I was like
[2602.32 --> 2603.48]  holy crap
[2603.48 --> 2604.68]  Seth Rogen's
[2604.68 --> 2605.32]  watching us
[2605.32 --> 2608.42]  that's not how
[2608.42 --> 2608.96]  it went down
[2608.96 --> 2610.52]  with the new
[2610.52 --> 2611.04]  installment of
[2611.04 --> 2611.82]  DDR4 RAM
[2611.82 --> 2612.58]  and LGA 2011
[2612.58 --> 2614.46]  IVE CPUs
[2614.46 --> 2614.98]  what do you expect
[2614.98 --> 2615.52]  of the upcoming
[2615.52 --> 2616.00]  motherboards
[2616.00 --> 2616.44]  features and
[2616.44 --> 2616.86]  performance
[2616.86 --> 2617.48]  more features
[2617.48 --> 2617.86]  and better
[2617.86 --> 2618.40]  performance
[2618.40 --> 2619.60]  slick ever
[2619.60 --> 2620.08]  end up going
[2620.08 --> 2620.58]  to Gautacon
[2620.58 --> 2621.34]  yep
[2621.34 --> 2622.20]  okay
[2622.20 --> 2623.40]  cool
[2623.40 --> 2624.62]  oh yeah
[2624.62 --> 2625.10]  you won
[2625.10 --> 2625.54]  something at
[2625.54 --> 2625.96]  Gautacon
[2625.96 --> 2626.48]  yeah
[2626.48 --> 2627.34]  I won Battlefield 3
[2627.34 --> 2627.64]  Premium
[2627.64 --> 2628.90]  and like the
[2628.90 --> 2629.34]  whole thing
[2629.34 --> 2630.32]  like Battlefield 3
[2630.32 --> 2631.18]  and Battlefield 3
[2631.18 --> 2631.40]  Premium
[2631.40 --> 2632.46]  some 14 year old
[2632.46 --> 2633.16]  mouthed off to him
[2633.16 --> 2633.56]  or something
[2633.56 --> 2634.02]  so
[2634.02 --> 2635.82]  okay so
[2635.82 --> 2638.98]  I was pretty upset
[2638.98 --> 2641.24]  my brother
[2641.24 --> 2641.88]  a really good
[2641.88 --> 2642.56]  friend of mine
[2642.56 --> 2643.18]  and a buddy
[2643.18 --> 2644.02]  that I've met
[2644.02 --> 2644.70]  over time
[2644.70 --> 2645.86]  were all on one
[2645.86 --> 2646.24]  team
[2646.24 --> 2647.08]  but we didn't have
[2647.08 --> 2647.90]  Battlefield 3
[2647.90 --> 2648.40]  pre-installed
[2648.40 --> 2648.94]  on the computers
[2648.94 --> 2649.30]  that we brought
[2649.30 --> 2649.80]  to the LAN
[2649.80 --> 2650.50]  cool story bro
[2650.50 --> 2651.28]  and we show up
[2651.28 --> 2651.72]  and there's a
[2651.72 --> 2652.20]  Battlefield 3
[2652.20 --> 2652.46]  tournament
[2652.46 --> 2653.26]  so we sign up
[2653.26 --> 2654.08]  but we borrow
[2654.08 --> 2654.54]  other people's
[2654.54 --> 2654.84]  machines
[2654.84 --> 2655.26]  because they have
[2655.26 --> 2655.84]  them pre-installed
[2655.84 --> 2656.66]  I just grab my
[2656.66 --> 2657.02]  peripherals
[2657.02 --> 2657.74]  sit down and go
[2657.74 --> 2658.42]  so we're all
[2658.42 --> 2658.82]  spread out
[2658.82 --> 2659.08]  there at the
[2659.08 --> 2659.50]  LAN party
[2659.50 --> 2660.42]  the other team
[2660.42 --> 2660.84]  is in one
[2660.84 --> 2661.42]  perfect little
[2661.42 --> 2662.18]  row and is all
[2662.18 --> 2662.56]  set up
[2662.56 --> 2664.02]  and we don't
[2664.02 --> 2664.26]  play
[2664.26 --> 2664.90]  my team does
[2664.90 --> 2665.24]  not play
[2665.24 --> 2665.72]  Battlefield 3
[2665.72 --> 2666.08]  together
[2666.08 --> 2667.62]  certain ones
[2667.62 --> 2668.22]  there had never
[2668.22 --> 2668.86]  played a game
[2668.86 --> 2669.22]  together
[2669.22 --> 2670.54]  and we're all
[2670.54 --> 2670.92]  spread out
[2670.92 --> 2671.28]  so we have
[2671.28 --> 2672.10]  very minimal
[2672.10 --> 2672.72]  communication
[2672.72 --> 2673.36]  because like
[2673.36 --> 2673.90]  I didn't have
[2673.90 --> 2674.70]  a working mic
[2674.70 --> 2675.46]  and like
[2675.46 --> 2676.08]  blah blah blah
[2676.08 --> 2676.24]  blah blah
[2676.24 --> 2677.48]  like it wasn't
[2677.48 --> 2678.06]  like we weren't
[2678.06 --> 2678.50]  in the best
[2678.50 --> 2679.00]  situation
[2679.00 --> 2680.10]  we start off
[2680.10 --> 2680.50]  the round
[2680.50 --> 2682.66]  it's 5 to 0
[2682.66 --> 2683.16]  for them
[2683.16 --> 2683.80]  and it's first
[2683.80 --> 2684.70]  group to 20
[2684.70 --> 2685.06]  kills
[2685.06 --> 2685.66]  so we're
[2685.66 --> 2686.40]  not doing
[2686.40 --> 2686.74]  good
[2686.74 --> 2688.30]  and I have
[2688.30 --> 2689.04]  three of those
[2689.04 --> 2689.48]  deaths
[2689.48 --> 2690.28]  so I'm like
[2690.28 --> 2690.68]  I'm going to
[2690.68 --> 2691.24]  single handedly
[2691.24 --> 2691.82]  lose us this
[2691.82 --> 2692.10]  game
[2692.10 --> 2692.78]  and I start
[2692.78 --> 2693.24]  joking around
[2693.24 --> 2693.58]  with the guy
[2693.58 --> 2694.06]  beside me
[2694.06 --> 2695.02]  that because
[2695.02 --> 2695.48]  the team
[2695.48 --> 2695.82]  on the other
[2695.82 --> 2696.06]  side of the
[2696.06 --> 2696.64]  table is using
[2696.64 --> 2697.36]  like code names
[2697.36 --> 2697.92]  for where they
[2697.92 --> 2698.14]  are
[2698.14 --> 2698.64]  code names
[2698.64 --> 2699.38]  for each other
[2699.38 --> 2699.92]  code names
[2699.92 --> 2700.32]  for different
[2700.32 --> 2700.72]  hallways
[2700.72 --> 2701.52]  like serious
[2701.52 --> 2702.04]  business
[2702.04 --> 2702.86]  which is awesome
[2702.86 --> 2703.52]  but we just
[2703.52 --> 2704.36]  weren't
[2704.36 --> 2704.84]  so
[2704.84 --> 2705.62]  this is round
[2705.62 --> 2706.16]  one right
[2706.16 --> 2706.68]  this is round
[2706.68 --> 2706.96]  one
[2706.96 --> 2707.28]  okay
[2707.28 --> 2707.94]  and these guys
[2707.94 --> 2708.56]  were expected
[2708.56 --> 2709.62]  to win
[2709.62 --> 2710.08]  okay
[2710.08 --> 2711.48]  like serious
[2711.48 --> 2711.98]  business
[2711.98 --> 2712.28]  yeah
[2712.28 --> 2713.30]  so I'm sitting
[2713.30 --> 2713.78]  beside a guy
[2713.78 --> 2714.22]  beside me
[2714.22 --> 2717.30]  the guy
[2717.30 --> 2717.70]  beside me
[2717.70 --> 2717.92]  and I
[2717.92 --> 2718.36]  start making
[2718.36 --> 2718.94]  jokes about
[2718.94 --> 2719.46]  how I'm an
[2719.46 --> 2719.96]  extra in a
[2719.96 --> 2720.48]  movie because
[2720.48 --> 2721.06]  I keep dying
[2721.06 --> 2721.56]  so much
[2721.56 --> 2722.56]  and just like
[2722.56 --> 2723.24]  not really
[2723.24 --> 2723.84]  caring that much
[2723.84 --> 2724.30]  at this point
[2724.30 --> 2724.94]  you're ridiculous
[2724.94 --> 2726.28]  and then I'm
[2726.28 --> 2726.68]  sitting at the
[2726.68 --> 2727.16]  bottom of the
[2727.16 --> 2727.70]  stairs just
[2727.70 --> 2728.34]  getting suppressed
[2728.34 --> 2729.14]  and being retarded
[2729.14 --> 2730.18]  and then the
[2730.18 --> 2730.94]  guy sitting
[2730.94 --> 2731.36]  across the
[2731.36 --> 2731.82]  table from me
[2731.82 --> 2732.40]  starts openly
[2732.40 --> 2733.08]  making fun of
[2733.08 --> 2733.70]  me and then
[2733.70 --> 2734.16]  I got pissed
[2734.16 --> 2734.38]  off
[2734.38 --> 2734.90]  yeah that guy
[2734.90 --> 2735.26]  at the bottom
[2735.26 --> 2735.72]  of the stairs
[2735.72 --> 2736.34]  what a loser
[2736.34 --> 2736.94]  what a loser
[2736.94 --> 2737.46]  basically
[2737.46 --> 2738.62]  basically
[2738.62 --> 2740.06]  and then I
[2740.06 --> 2740.42]  ended the
[2740.42 --> 2740.98]  round 16
[2740.98 --> 2741.36]  and 4
[2741.36 --> 2743.72]  so I just
[2743.72 --> 2744.52]  destroyed everyone
[2744.52 --> 2745.06]  and we won
[2745.06 --> 2745.38]  the game
[2745.38 --> 2746.68]  and then top
[2746.68 --> 2747.68]  prizes was
[2747.68 --> 2749.12]  a BitPhoenix
[2749.12 --> 2750.80]  XL for
[2750.80 --> 2751.56]  video games
[2751.56 --> 2752.86]  right so you
[2752.86 --> 2753.16]  took the
[2753.16 --> 2753.78]  Battlefield 3
[2753.78 --> 2754.16]  premium
[2754.16 --> 2756.14]  good choice
[2756.14 --> 2756.96]  mind you
[2756.96 --> 2757.70]  Shinobi XL is
[2757.70 --> 2758.38]  a good case
[2758.38 --> 2759.04]  yeah
[2759.04 --> 2759.78]  okay maybe not
[2759.78 --> 2760.42]  good but it's
[2760.42 --> 2760.98]  not bad
[2760.98 --> 2762.60]  yeah but we
[2762.60 --> 2763.04]  also had to
[2763.04 --> 2763.60]  get it back
[2763.60 --> 2765.12]  right you're
[2765.12 --> 2765.46]  on the island
[2765.46 --> 2766.04]  and three of
[2766.04 --> 2766.56]  us are all
[2766.56 --> 2767.14]  going in the
[2767.14 --> 2768.14]  same vehicle
[2768.14 --> 2768.64]  screw that
[2768.64 --> 2768.88]  noise
[2768.88 --> 2769.58]  like it was
[2769.58 --> 2769.80]  not
[2769.80 --> 2770.40]  the Shinobi XL
[2770.40 --> 2770.96]  is a big
[2770.96 --> 2771.36]  case
[2771.36 --> 2772.82]  we lost
[2772.82 --> 2773.60]  the last round
[2773.60 --> 2774.52]  for clarification
[2774.52 --> 2775.08]  oh did you
[2775.08 --> 2775.58]  we lost the
[2775.58 --> 2775.88]  last round
[2775.88 --> 2776.10]  so you guys
[2776.10 --> 2776.46]  came in second
[2776.46 --> 2776.96]  but we had
[2776.96 --> 2777.52]  actually like
[2777.52 --> 2778.06]  talked about
[2778.06 --> 2778.66]  purposely losing
[2778.66 --> 2779.06]  it we did
[2779.06 --> 2779.62]  not purposely
[2779.62 --> 2780.22]  lose it but
[2780.22 --> 2780.64]  we had talked
[2780.64 --> 2781.12]  about it and
[2781.12 --> 2781.70]  it was 4 in
[2781.70 --> 2782.42]  the morning and
[2782.42 --> 2783.36]  like it was
[2783.36 --> 2783.92]  not a very good
[2783.92 --> 2784.38]  situation
[2784.38 --> 2785.26]  oh so I'm
[2785.26 --> 2785.58]  not worried
[2785.58 --> 2786.10]  about that
[2786.10 --> 2787.52]  okay all right
[2787.52 --> 2787.84]  do you think
[2787.84 --> 2788.18]  you could have
[2788.18 --> 2788.54]  beat them
[2788.54 --> 2789.38]  I think so
[2789.38 --> 2789.58]  yeah
[2789.58 --> 2790.92]  that's what
[2790.92 --> 2791.52]  losers say
[2791.52 --> 2792.18]  we didn't lose
[2792.18 --> 2793.02]  by a huge amount
[2793.02 --> 2794.02]  we didn't lose
[2794.02 --> 2794.66]  by a huge amount
[2794.66 --> 2795.24]  and like my
[2795.24 --> 2795.88]  brother and I
[2795.88 --> 2796.74]  didn't do as
[2796.74 --> 2797.20]  great as we
[2797.20 --> 2797.74]  did the previous
[2797.74 --> 2798.10]  round
[2798.10 --> 2798.44]  okay
[2798.44 --> 2799.36]  and yada yada
[2799.36 --> 2799.58]  yada
[2799.58 --> 2800.96]  um
[2800.96 --> 2803.00]  all right
[2803.00 --> 2804.50]  so okay
[2804.50 --> 2805.32]  so let's talk
[2805.32 --> 2806.44]  about our new
[2806.44 --> 2808.46]  topic which is
[2808.46 --> 2809.34]  why would
[2809.34 --> 2811.30]  I'm listening
[2811.30 --> 2811.94]  I just remembered
[2811.94 --> 2812.54]  what you're talking
[2812.54 --> 2812.84]  about
[2812.84 --> 2814.04]  what
[2814.04 --> 2815.94]  the new topic
[2815.94 --> 2816.84]  yeah the new topic
[2816.84 --> 2817.58]  yeah just remember
[2817.58 --> 2818.64]  just keep going
[2818.64 --> 2819.74]  don't worry about it
[2819.74 --> 2821.08]  good work
[2821.08 --> 2821.82]  okay
[2821.82 --> 2823.76]  so the new topic
[2823.76 --> 2824.52]  is
[2824.52 --> 2826.02]  we want to take
[2826.02 --> 2826.94]  your guys's thoughts
[2826.94 --> 2828.12]  because for those
[2828.12 --> 2829.14]  of you who don't
[2829.14 --> 2829.52]  know
[2829.52 --> 2830.44]  um
[2830.44 --> 2831.18]  one
[2831.18 --> 2833.24]  month and
[2833.24 --> 2834.10]  eight days ago
[2834.10 --> 2835.04]  I
[2835.04 --> 2836.56]  did resign
[2836.56 --> 2837.60]  my position
[2837.60 --> 2839.42]  that I had
[2839.42 --> 2840.74]  for full-time
[2840.74 --> 2842.26]  monetary employment
[2842.26 --> 2843.78]  which is
[2843.78 --> 2845.12]  not the correct
[2845.12 --> 2845.74]  way to say that
[2845.74 --> 2846.82]  but not too
[2846.82 --> 2847.36]  worried about it
[2847.36 --> 2847.78]  at this point
[2847.78 --> 2848.14]  in time
[2848.14 --> 2849.12]  um
[2849.12 --> 2850.54]  so I am now
[2850.54 --> 2852.14]  running my own
[2852.14 --> 2853.18]  company which is
[2853.18 --> 2854.48]  called creatively
[2854.48 --> 2856.18]  Linus Media Group
[2856.18 --> 2856.50]  Inc
[2856.50 --> 2859.32]  I know
[2859.32 --> 2860.22]  it's a stupid name
[2860.22 --> 2861.30]  just calm down
[2861.30 --> 2863.14]  um
[2863.14 --> 2864.32]  at least I don't
[2864.32 --> 2865.60]  work for Linus Media Group
[2865.60 --> 2867.64]  it's words
[2867.64 --> 2868.84]  it's so much
[2868.84 --> 2869.26]  worse
[2869.26 --> 2871.78]  it's so bad
[2871.78 --> 2872.76]  if someone asks me
[2872.76 --> 2873.02]  they're like
[2873.02 --> 2873.68]  oh who do you work for
[2873.68 --> 2873.92]  I'm like
[2873.92 --> 2874.36]  uh
[2874.36 --> 2875.12]  um
[2875.12 --> 2876.94]  Linus Media Group
[2876.94 --> 2877.34]  they're like
[2877.34 --> 2878.28]  oh who's Linus
[2878.28 --> 2878.72]  and I'm like
[2878.72 --> 2880.32]  my boss
[2880.32 --> 2883.00]  don't worry about it
[2883.00 --> 2884.18]  it's okay
[2884.18 --> 2885.48]  so um
[2885.48 --> 2886.08]  so um
[2886.08 --> 2886.10]  so um
[2886.10 --> 2886.64]  so um
[2886.64 --> 2888.08]  so Linus Media Group
[2888.08 --> 2889.54]  so um
[2889.54 --> 2890.36]  I don't know if you guys
[2890.36 --> 2890.72]  know this
[2890.72 --> 2891.60]  but Slick and I
[2891.60 --> 2892.46]  used to
[2892.46 --> 2893.24]  work together
[2893.24 --> 2894.14]  on
[2894.14 --> 2895.34]  on Tech Tips
[2895.34 --> 2895.80]  in general
[2895.80 --> 2896.56]  Linus Tech Tips
[2896.56 --> 2897.52]  NCIX Tech Tips
[2897.52 --> 2898.38]  even cat videos
[2898.38 --> 2899.06]  from time to time
[2899.06 --> 2899.88]  he'd help out with
[2899.88 --> 2901.06]  and
[2901.06 --> 2902.90]  um
[2902.90 --> 2903.14]  so
[2903.14 --> 2903.82]  but he was
[2903.82 --> 2905.06]  he was never actually
[2905.06 --> 2905.90]  he never actually
[2905.90 --> 2906.76]  worked at NCIX
[2906.76 --> 2908.08]  so
[2908.08 --> 2908.78]  uh
[2908.78 --> 2909.58]  so Slick
[2909.58 --> 2910.72]  has joined
[2910.72 --> 2911.48]  um
[2911.48 --> 2913.56]  has joined my new company
[2913.56 --> 2915.40]  Diesel has joined my new company
[2915.40 --> 2917.04]  Diesel is no longer an intern
[2917.04 --> 2918.90]  we still call him Diesel the intern
[2918.90 --> 2919.94]  sort of
[2919.94 --> 2920.22]  you know
[2920.22 --> 2920.72]  casually
[2920.72 --> 2922.50]  but he is not an intern
[2922.50 --> 2923.82]  by any stretch of the imagination
[2923.82 --> 2926.20]  he is very much an important part of our team
[2926.20 --> 2927.20]  and
[2927.20 --> 2927.60]  uh
[2927.60 --> 2929.82]  we are trying to do some interesting stuff
[2929.82 --> 2930.12]  so
[2930.12 --> 2932.60]  I want to be real clear up front with you guys
[2932.60 --> 2934.06]  that Linus
[2934.06 --> 2935.20]  sort of
[2935.20 --> 2936.44]  the productions that we do
[2936.44 --> 2937.30]  whether it's for
[2937.30 --> 2939.98]  so I've been showing previews of this for a long time
[2939.98 --> 2942.20]  this is why I acquired all this gear
[2942.20 --> 2943.06]  um
[2943.06 --> 2945.72]  this is why I was trying to figure out
[2945.72 --> 2948.34]  how to do a more professional style
[2948.34 --> 2950.04]  whether it was the watch
[2950.04 --> 2951.56]  or whether it was the galaxy
[2951.56 --> 2953.80]  tab
[2953.80 --> 2954.64]  2
[2954.64 --> 2956.10]  or whatever that tablet was
[2956.10 --> 2957.04]  or that thing
[2957.04 --> 2958.20]  or the uh
[2958.20 --> 2959.52]  Corsair Survivor Stealth
[2959.52 --> 2960.76]  or even that uh
[2960.76 --> 2961.44]  I know the one
[2961.44 --> 2961.88]  the uh
[2961.88 --> 2963.08]  the camera mount thing
[2963.08 --> 2963.78]  with all the claws
[2963.78 --> 2965.78]  so we were trying different video styles
[2965.78 --> 2968.56]  I think a lot of you probably saw the video we did
[2968.56 --> 2971.40]  on the Corsair Survivor Stealth
[2971.40 --> 2972.98]  the USB 3 drive
[2972.98 --> 2975.34]  that was our first actual project
[2975.34 --> 2976.34]  that we worked on
[2976.34 --> 2977.10]  as uh
[2977.10 --> 2977.90]  as our new
[2977.90 --> 2979.14]  as our new unit
[2979.14 --> 2981.02]  wasn't perfect
[2981.02 --> 2982.28]  by any stretch of the imagination
[2982.28 --> 2982.86]  but
[2982.86 --> 2984.46]  it was uh
[2984.46 --> 2985.42]  it was something that
[2985.42 --> 2985.68]  you know
[2985.68 --> 2986.14]  we could be
[2986.14 --> 2987.00]  we could be proud of
[2987.00 --> 2988.20]  it's not a review
[2988.20 --> 2989.48]  to be very clear
[2989.48 --> 2991.20]  although we still feel
[2991.20 --> 2992.92]  strongly about not saying anything
[2992.92 --> 2993.98]  that we don't believe
[2993.98 --> 2994.82]  is true
[2994.82 --> 2996.42]  and not working with partners
[2996.42 --> 2997.28]  who we believe
[2997.28 --> 2998.84]  deliver shoddy service
[2998.84 --> 2999.72]  or shoddy products
[2999.72 --> 3000.72]  or anything like that
[3000.72 --> 3001.36]  um
[3001.36 --> 3002.64]  so I don't know if you guys have noticed
[3002.64 --> 3004.22]  but the Tech Quickie channel
[3004.22 --> 3005.82]  so that's youtube.com
[3005.82 --> 3007.04]  slash techquickie
[3007.04 --> 3009.82]  is a completely separate stream
[3009.82 --> 3010.74]  for Linus Tech Tips
[3010.74 --> 3012.20]  it's a very different style of content
[3012.20 --> 3014.38]  the fastest possible episodes
[3014.38 --> 3015.88]  are aimed at more like
[3015.88 --> 3017.18]  uh
[3017.18 --> 3019.22]  like quick digestible information
[3019.22 --> 3021.84]  that may be sometimes more complicated
[3021.84 --> 3023.12]  like how to install a CPU
[3023.12 --> 3026.10]  and may sometimes be less complicated
[3026.10 --> 3027.56]  like um
[3027.56 --> 3029.10]  what's USB 3
[3029.10 --> 3030.40]  so it's
[3030.40 --> 3031.72]  it's stuff that you can watch
[3031.72 --> 3033.20]  or stuff that you can share with
[3033.20 --> 3034.86]  your mom when she asks you a question
[3034.86 --> 3035.38]  and
[3035.38 --> 3035.84]  and like
[3035.84 --> 3036.94]  quick reference stuff
[3036.94 --> 3038.52]  like stuff that you're probably gonna have to
[3038.52 --> 3039.26]  repetitively look up
[3039.26 --> 3039.82]  like we have
[3039.82 --> 3040.68]  videos on raid
[3040.68 --> 3041.24]  different
[3041.24 --> 3042.26]  different levels of raid
[3042.26 --> 3042.80]  which like
[3042.80 --> 3044.02]  you're probably not gonna be able to
[3044.02 --> 3046.94]  memorize all that kind of stuff
[3046.94 --> 3048.68]  so if you need to just reference really quick
[3048.68 --> 3049.20]  all the time
[3049.20 --> 3050.32]  you don't wanna like wiki it
[3050.32 --> 3050.64]  and
[3050.64 --> 3051.18]  just look there
[3051.18 --> 3052.92]  some people prefer a video
[3052.92 --> 3054.80]  versus looking it up on wikipedia
[3054.80 --> 3055.42]  or whatever else
[3055.42 --> 3056.28]  some people prefer that
[3056.28 --> 3056.70]  and that's
[3056.70 --> 3057.62]  why we're here
[3057.62 --> 3059.64]  that's why we exist at all
[3059.64 --> 3060.48]  so
[3060.48 --> 3061.18]  um
[3061.18 --> 3062.08]  so right
[3062.08 --> 3062.74]  so there's that
[3062.74 --> 3064.16]  and then the techquickie channel
[3064.16 --> 3065.40]  will also be a repository
[3065.40 --> 3066.36]  for any
[3066.36 --> 3067.18]  uh
[3067.18 --> 3067.86]  any content
[3067.86 --> 3068.52]  that
[3068.52 --> 3069.44]  we are
[3069.44 --> 3071.40]  hired to produce
[3071.40 --> 3073.42]  so that's the survivor stealth
[3073.42 --> 3075.00]  that's the voyager air
[3075.00 --> 3075.46]  of course
[3075.46 --> 3077.16]  they're actually used the voyager air
[3077.16 --> 3078.26]  at their press event
[3078.26 --> 3078.96]  at cds
[3078.96 --> 3080.08]  to launch the product
[3080.08 --> 3081.46]  to the media
[3081.46 --> 3082.52]  which was very cool
[3082.52 --> 3084.16]  one thing that we want to be
[3084.16 --> 3087.40]  absolutely ridiculously clear about
[3087.40 --> 3088.80]  100% clear about
[3088.80 --> 3089.54]  is this
[3089.54 --> 3090.28]  angle
[3090.28 --> 3091.86]  is touching techquickie
[3091.86 --> 3092.90]  this angle
[3092.90 --> 3094.08]  is not
[3094.08 --> 3095.54]  touching Linus Tech Tips
[3095.54 --> 3096.60]  Linus Tech Tips
[3096.60 --> 3097.60]  will remain
[3097.60 --> 3099.98]  just us getting product
[3099.98 --> 3101.86]  editorial content
[3101.86 --> 3102.36]  yeah
[3102.36 --> 3103.76]  us getting product
[3103.76 --> 3104.82]  reviewing the product
[3104.82 --> 3106.12]  unboxing the products
[3106.12 --> 3106.82]  like
[3106.82 --> 3107.24]  yeah
[3107.24 --> 3108.38]  just more kind of
[3108.38 --> 3109.34]  bloggy kind of stuff
[3109.34 --> 3110.70]  us figuring stuff out
[3110.70 --> 3110.98]  like
[3110.98 --> 3112.30]  benchmarking games
[3112.30 --> 3112.62]  yeah
[3112.62 --> 3113.24]  little tips
[3113.24 --> 3113.98]  like the one we did
[3113.98 --> 3114.78]  about True Crypt
[3114.78 --> 3115.78]  not that long ago
[3115.78 --> 3116.56]  so
[3116.56 --> 3117.98]  so keeping it real
[3117.98 --> 3119.20]  on Linus Tech Tips
[3119.20 --> 3120.04]  the only things
[3120.04 --> 3120.84]  that will really change
[3120.84 --> 3121.36]  is hopefully
[3121.36 --> 3122.48]  quality improvements
[3122.48 --> 3123.62]  no like
[3123.62 --> 3124.16]  actual
[3124.16 --> 3125.02]  status
[3125.02 --> 3126.34]  level of the channel
[3126.34 --> 3126.52]  yeah
[3126.52 --> 3126.78]  and I mean
[3126.78 --> 3127.84]  little quality improvements
[3127.84 --> 3128.84]  like dual cam
[3128.84 --> 3129.82]  like
[3129.82 --> 3130.36]  not like
[3130.36 --> 3131.22]  quality improvements
[3131.22 --> 3131.78]  like
[3131.78 --> 3133.02]  you know
[3133.02 --> 3133.54]  a giant
[3133.54 --> 3134.84]  oh I was gonna
[3134.84 --> 3135.36]  take a jab
[3135.36 --> 3135.80]  at someone
[3135.80 --> 3136.64]  but never mind
[3136.64 --> 3138.14]  one thing
[3138.14 --> 3138.74]  we may start
[3138.74 --> 3139.78]  doing Linus Tech Tips
[3139.78 --> 3140.84]  is we may have
[3140.84 --> 3141.78]  we may have
[3141.78 --> 3142.60]  sponsored spots
[3142.60 --> 3143.58]  before in the videos
[3143.58 --> 3144.96]  like we had
[3144.96 --> 3146.40]  on our CES content
[3146.40 --> 3147.62]  where honestly
[3147.62 --> 3148.90]  we can't go to CES
[3148.90 --> 3149.26]  like
[3149.26 --> 3149.78]  I don't know
[3149.78 --> 3150.36]  if you guys know
[3150.36 --> 3151.38]  how expensive it is
[3151.38 --> 3151.94]  it's really expensive
[3151.94 --> 3152.58]  to drag
[3152.58 --> 3154.26]  a number of people
[3154.26 --> 3155.52]  and like
[3155.52 --> 3155.98]  equipment
[3155.98 --> 3156.86]  and
[3156.86 --> 3157.36]  I think people
[3157.36 --> 3158.02]  understand that
[3158.02 --> 3158.82]  it's good that we're
[3158.82 --> 3159.18]  clarifying
[3159.18 --> 3159.70]  but I think people
[3159.70 --> 3159.80]  understand that
[3159.80 --> 3160.34]  well it's more expensive
[3160.34 --> 3161.32]  than they think I bet
[3161.32 --> 3162.20]  true
[3162.20 --> 3163.04]  for sure
[3163.04 --> 3164.34]  so it's very expensive
[3164.34 --> 3165.26]  and without sponsors
[3165.26 --> 3166.10]  we can't do that
[3166.10 --> 3167.04]  and without sponsors
[3167.04 --> 3168.20]  because we're not
[3168.20 --> 3169.42]  we're not actually
[3169.42 --> 3170.42]  necessarily
[3170.42 --> 3171.18]  directly
[3171.18 --> 3173.34]  compensated
[3173.34 --> 3174.18]  by anyone
[3174.18 --> 3175.62]  without sponsors
[3175.62 --> 3176.38]  we won't survive
[3176.38 --> 3178.08]  so we might have
[3178.08 --> 3178.76]  something like
[3178.76 --> 3180.90]  you know
[3180.90 --> 3181.42]  I don't know
[3181.42 --> 3183.40]  this video game
[3183.40 --> 3184.92]  video card roundup
[3184.92 --> 3186.08]  is sponsored by
[3186.08 --> 3186.70]  Intel
[3186.70 --> 3187.62]  why we choose
[3187.62 --> 3188.34]  Intel for our
[3188.34 --> 3189.02]  test platform
[3189.02 --> 3189.82]  and we won't ask
[3189.82 --> 3190.72]  Intel to sponsor it
[3190.72 --> 3191.12]  if we weren't
[3191.12 --> 3191.96]  already going to use
[3191.96 --> 3192.72]  an Intel platform
[3192.72 --> 3193.56]  for our test bench
[3193.56 --> 3194.10]  and one thing
[3194.10 --> 3194.72]  we will likely do
[3194.72 --> 3195.66]  is not for like
[3195.66 --> 3196.56]  video game
[3196.56 --> 3197.58]  video card
[3197.58 --> 3198.32]  head to head
[3198.32 --> 3198.90]  we're probably
[3198.90 --> 3199.46]  not going to pick
[3199.46 --> 3200.12]  in video AMD
[3200.12 --> 3200.52]  that's right
[3200.52 --> 3201.24]  that's why I chose
[3201.24 --> 3201.50]  Intel
[3201.50 --> 3202.18]  we're not going to
[3202.18 --> 3203.18]  pick one of the
[3203.18 --> 3203.78]  things that are
[3203.78 --> 3204.88]  in direct competition
[3204.88 --> 3205.74]  we're going to pick
[3205.74 --> 3206.30]  something like
[3206.30 --> 3207.20]  this is our
[3207.20 --> 3208.04]  video card test bench
[3208.04 --> 3208.74]  right here
[3208.74 --> 3209.76]  our video card test
[3209.76 --> 3210.58]  bench is a static
[3210.58 --> 3211.52]  2011 platform
[3211.52 --> 3212.94]  so picking Intel
[3212.94 --> 3213.44]  as a sponsor
[3213.44 --> 3214.16]  for that video
[3214.16 --> 3215.34]  is non-conflicting
[3215.34 --> 3216.00]  and makes sense
[3216.00 --> 3216.52]  that's right
[3216.52 --> 3217.68]  so whereas
[3217.68 --> 3218.42]  if we were doing
[3218.42 --> 3219.02]  something like
[3219.02 --> 3219.86]  okay something like
[3219.86 --> 3221.16]  my Windows Phone 8
[3221.16 --> 3221.70]  content
[3221.70 --> 3222.70]  we're not going to
[3222.70 --> 3223.44]  have that sponsored
[3223.44 --> 3224.02]  by Microsoft
[3224.02 --> 3225.50]  because they
[3225.50 --> 3226.40]  shouldn't have any
[3226.40 --> 3227.32]  say on what I say
[3227.32 --> 3228.28]  about Windows Phone 8
[3228.28 --> 3229.48]  however my experience
[3229.48 --> 3230.26]  with Windows Phone 8
[3230.26 --> 3230.92]  does happen to be
[3230.92 --> 3231.60]  getting increasingly
[3231.60 --> 3232.04]  positive
[3232.04 --> 3233.14]  but that's
[3233.14 --> 3233.42]  sort of
[3233.42 --> 3234.10]  besides the point
[3234.10 --> 3234.90]  getting used to it
[3234.90 --> 3237.30]  old school
[3237.30 --> 3238.02]  Apple guy
[3238.02 --> 3239.38]  finally getting out
[3239.38 --> 3239.96]  of his little
[3239.96 --> 3240.96]  protective bubble
[3240.96 --> 3241.86]  it's hardly old school
[3241.86 --> 3242.98]  the first Apple product
[3242.98 --> 3243.78]  I ever owned
[3243.78 --> 3244.86]  was an iPhone 4
[3244.86 --> 3245.90]  yeah but what else
[3245.90 --> 3246.54]  have you used
[3246.54 --> 3248.04]  nothing
[3248.04 --> 3249.74]  exactly
[3249.74 --> 3251.08]  so it's not old school
[3251.08 --> 3252.12]  you're finally getting out
[3252.12 --> 3252.46]  of your little
[3252.46 --> 3253.10]  protective bubble
[3253.10 --> 3253.60]  it's okay
[3253.60 --> 3254.36]  screw you
[3254.36 --> 3256.24]  okay so we'd love
[3256.24 --> 3256.94]  to take your guys'
[3256.94 --> 3257.96]  comments on this
[3257.96 --> 3259.20]  whole change in direction
[3259.20 --> 3260.42]  and we will not be
[3260.42 --> 3261.64]  acknowledging any
[3261.64 --> 3263.12]  other questions
[3263.12 --> 3264.44]  for the next
[3264.44 --> 3265.20]  little bit here
[3265.20 --> 3265.98]  hopefully people
[3265.98 --> 3267.16]  said stuff about that
[3267.16 --> 3269.72]  I don't think
[3269.72 --> 3270.42]  they did
[3270.42 --> 3274.22]  Sean asks
[3274.22 --> 3275.22]  is the product
[3275.22 --> 3276.20]  is our product
[3276.20 --> 3276.88]  access going to be
[3276.88 --> 3277.82]  affected by no longer
[3277.82 --> 3279.16]  we are still attached
[3279.16 --> 3279.72]  to NCIX
[3279.72 --> 3280.82]  to make that very clear
[3280.82 --> 3281.40]  our relationship
[3281.40 --> 3282.14]  with NCIX
[3282.14 --> 3283.46]  is really good
[3283.46 --> 3284.08]  and we still do
[3284.08 --> 3284.76]  NCIX tech tips
[3284.76 --> 3285.48]  we still do
[3285.48 --> 3286.38]  NCIX tech tips
[3286.38 --> 3286.88]  I don't know if you
[3286.88 --> 3287.44]  guys have noticed
[3287.44 --> 3288.66]  but NCIX tech tips
[3288.66 --> 3289.72]  is going strong
[3289.72 --> 3291.00]  and it's going to go
[3291.00 --> 3292.02]  for a long time
[3292.02 --> 3293.30]  I mean that was part of
[3293.30 --> 3294.00]  that was something
[3294.00 --> 3294.90]  that was really important
[3294.90 --> 3295.34]  to me
[3295.34 --> 3296.60]  because I don't know
[3296.60 --> 3297.62]  how many of you guys
[3297.62 --> 3298.10]  have been there
[3298.10 --> 3298.78]  from the beginning
[3298.78 --> 3300.46]  but I mean
[3300.46 --> 3301.54]  NCIX tech tips
[3301.54 --> 3302.16]  is my baby
[3302.16 --> 3303.44]  as much as Linus tech tips
[3303.44 --> 3304.76]  I was there from day one
[3304.76 --> 3306.06]  I built them
[3306.06 --> 3307.34]  with these two hands
[3307.34 --> 3312.44]  I built them
[3312.44 --> 3313.38]  with these two hands
[3313.38 --> 3314.44]  and you know
[3314.44 --> 3315.20]  it was really important
[3315.20 --> 3316.24]  to me that I still
[3316.24 --> 3317.46]  am able to work
[3317.46 --> 3318.22]  on that project
[3318.22 --> 3319.42]  so yes
[3319.42 --> 3321.06]  I'm still
[3321.06 --> 3322.36]  you know
[3322.36 --> 3324.08]  NCIX guys
[3324.08 --> 3324.98]  are still my buds
[3324.98 --> 3326.52]  and I'm still their bud
[3326.52 --> 3327.18]  and all that
[3327.18 --> 3327.96]  all that good stuff
[3327.96 --> 3328.88]  and I don't know
[3328.88 --> 3329.38]  if you've noticed
[3329.38 --> 3330.08]  but we've actually
[3330.08 --> 3331.50]  had some pretty cool stuff
[3331.50 --> 3332.36]  that we've unboxed
[3332.36 --> 3332.98]  this last month
[3332.98 --> 3333.54]  I mean remember
[3333.54 --> 3335.12]  this was five weeks ago
[3335.12 --> 3336.12]  that this was effective
[3336.12 --> 3337.32]  so yeah
[3337.32 --> 3338.02]  it's not like we had
[3338.02 --> 3338.62]  all that content
[3338.62 --> 3339.52]  filmed before that
[3339.52 --> 3339.92]  yeah
[3339.92 --> 3342.14]  thank you Ian
[3342.14 --> 3344.04]  thank you
[3344.04 --> 3345.18]  good to know
[3345.18 --> 3348.20]  that's not it
[3348.20 --> 3348.60]  nope
[3348.60 --> 3349.34]  that's not us
[3349.34 --> 3350.06]  I have no idea
[3350.06 --> 3350.72]  what that is
[3350.72 --> 3351.86]  wait
[3351.86 --> 3352.44]  hold on
[3352.44 --> 3353.06]  I'm worried
[3353.06 --> 3354.16]  I'm scared
[3354.16 --> 3354.82]  whenever we open
[3354.82 --> 3355.34]  these things
[3355.34 --> 3356.00]  no no it's okay
[3356.00 --> 3356.28]  they won't see
[3356.28 --> 3356.96]  I guess they can't see
[3356.96 --> 3357.78]  sound
[3357.78 --> 3358.92]  oh okay
[3358.92 --> 3360.50]  no actually
[3360.50 --> 3361.00]  that's
[3361.00 --> 3362.20]  they have cameras too
[3362.20 --> 3363.52]  but that's probably not us
[3363.52 --> 3364.62]  no that's a different company
[3364.62 --> 3365.90]  I think they're based out of New York
[3365.90 --> 3366.88]  I saw them
[3366.88 --> 3367.46]  oh
[3367.46 --> 3368.52]  so Peter asks
[3368.52 --> 3369.94]  what about NCIX Tech Tips
[3369.94 --> 3371.18]  everything is okay
[3371.18 --> 3372.36]  NCIX Tech Tips
[3372.36 --> 3373.54]  is gonna continue
[3373.54 --> 3374.40]  doing what it's doing
[3374.40 --> 3374.94]  in fact
[3374.94 --> 3376.08]  next week
[3376.08 --> 3376.80]  we're gonna be shooting
[3376.80 --> 3377.66]  that BitPhoenix
[3377.66 --> 3378.80]  water cooling guide
[3378.80 --> 3380.14]  the Prodigy water cooling guide
[3380.14 --> 3380.74]  that I promised
[3380.74 --> 3381.60]  ages ago
[3381.60 --> 3383.20]  and as some of you guys know
[3383.20 --> 3385.30]  we've released the
[3385.30 --> 3387.00]  swapping graphics card one right
[3387.00 --> 3388.00]  on the old platform
[3388.00 --> 3389.44]  no I don't think that one's live yet
[3389.44 --> 3391.04]  we've actually got about 10 videos
[3391.04 --> 3391.90]  uploaded that
[3391.90 --> 3393.30]  will be released
[3393.30 --> 3394.08]  sort of when
[3394.08 --> 3394.76]  when they're ready
[3394.76 --> 3398.04]  I do not
[3398.04 --> 3400.14]  oh
[3400.14 --> 3402.00]  I want to clarify the question
[3402.00 --> 3403.40]  well
[3403.40 --> 3404.76]  well okay actually
[3404.76 --> 3405.44]  okay to be clear
[3405.44 --> 3406.08]  I still do
[3406.08 --> 3407.80]  just in a different
[3407.80 --> 3408.28]  different
[3408.28 --> 3409.10]  different capacities
[3409.10 --> 3411.16]  so I am not a product manager anymore
[3411.16 --> 3412.88]  I'm not a product manager
[3412.88 --> 3414.20]  I'm not a category manager
[3414.20 --> 3415.98]  so I don't
[3415.98 --> 3416.96]  I don't have an office
[3416.96 --> 3418.78]  still have a studio there
[3418.78 --> 3419.82]  that we still go to
[3419.82 --> 3420.48]  and we still
[3420.48 --> 3422.36]  work on NCIX Tech Tips
[3422.36 --> 3423.30]  but
[3423.30 --> 3424.36]  this is a different
[3424.36 --> 3425.36]  this is a different direction
[3425.36 --> 3426.12]  we want to do some
[3426.12 --> 3427.04]  kind of different stuff
[3427.04 --> 3428.10]  and
[3428.10 --> 3429.64]  we thought that this was
[3429.64 --> 3431.02]  a good time to do it
[3431.02 --> 3433.56]  well it's not a great time to do it
[3433.56 --> 3434.08]  no
[3434.08 --> 3434.54]  yeah
[3434.54 --> 3435.58]  new baby and all that
[3435.58 --> 3435.90]  but
[3435.90 --> 3437.94]  but it seemed like
[3437.94 --> 3439.08]  the right time to do it
[3439.08 --> 3440.14]  and I think when you guys
[3440.14 --> 3440.90]  see the video
[3440.90 --> 3442.02]  that we previewed
[3442.02 --> 3442.60]  with that
[3442.60 --> 3443.86]  with that picture
[3443.86 --> 3445.38]  this picture
[3445.38 --> 3446.60]  that apparently
[3446.60 --> 3447.52]  can't find
[3447.52 --> 3448.16]  right now
[3448.16 --> 3449.44]  whatever
[3449.44 --> 3450.00]  don't worry about it
[3450.00 --> 3450.56]  it's a cool picture
[3450.56 --> 3452.50]  so that video
[3452.50 --> 3453.14]  that we previewed
[3453.14 --> 3453.72]  should give you guys
[3453.72 --> 3454.20]  some idea
[3454.20 --> 3455.18]  of what we want
[3455.18 --> 3456.20]  to be doing
[3456.20 --> 3456.88]  because
[3456.88 --> 3458.56]  one of my biggest frustrations
[3458.56 --> 3459.96]  always has been
[3459.96 --> 3461.06]  how many different jobs
[3461.06 --> 3461.54]  I've had
[3461.54 --> 3463.00]  so over the years
[3463.00 --> 3464.36]  if you've read the thread
[3464.36 --> 3465.94]  on LinusTechTips.com
[3465.94 --> 3466.60]  with the
[3466.60 --> 3467.42]  my story thread
[3467.42 --> 3467.96]  if you search for
[3467.96 --> 3468.50]  my story
[3468.50 --> 3469.90]  it'll be all the stuff
[3469.90 --> 3470.48]  that I've done
[3470.48 --> 3472.10]  to become a professional
[3472.10 --> 3473.24]  unboxer so to speak
[3473.24 --> 3474.54]  and you know
[3474.54 --> 3475.80]  I've always been a product manager
[3475.80 --> 3478.18]  or in charge of the PC configurations
[3478.18 --> 3480.02]  or you know
[3480.02 --> 3482.34]  doing all the water cooling builds
[3482.34 --> 3484.32]  or like there's always been something
[3484.32 --> 3485.22]  I've never really been able
[3485.22 --> 3486.26]  to focus on video
[3486.26 --> 3487.54]  and I think that
[3487.54 --> 3489.10]  with more time to focus on it
[3489.10 --> 3491.12]  I can be more focused
[3491.12 --> 3496.18]  keep going
[3496.18 --> 3498.36]  which I think will
[3498.36 --> 3499.70]  improve the quality
[3499.70 --> 3500.22]  of the content
[3500.22 --> 3500.94]  and it will
[3500.94 --> 3502.02]  just make it better
[3502.02 --> 3502.98]  for everyone
[3502.98 --> 3503.82]  concerned
[3503.82 --> 3506.40]  I was trying to figure out
[3506.40 --> 3507.02]  why he said
[3507.02 --> 3508.16]  LinusMediaGroup.com
[3508.16 --> 3508.62]  has crashed
[3508.62 --> 3509.60]  and I finally figured it out
[3509.60 --> 3510.76]  oh
[3510.76 --> 3512.34]  oh yeah
[3512.34 --> 3512.88]  because you never
[3512.88 --> 3513.50]  turned it back on
[3513.50 --> 3513.80]  did you
[3513.80 --> 3514.46]  you made me take
[3514.46 --> 3515.16]  the power supply out
[3515.16 --> 3515.76]  oh that's right
[3515.76 --> 3516.42]  yeah
[3516.42 --> 3517.02]  server's down
[3517.02 --> 3518.70]  LinusTechTips.com
[3518.70 --> 3519.16]  is okay though
[3519.16 --> 3519.80]  that server's up
[3519.80 --> 3521.88]  all good luck
[3521.88 --> 3522.54]  thank you
[3522.54 --> 3523.84]  does this mean
[3523.84 --> 3524.66]  no it does not mean
[3524.66 --> 3525.74]  no more NCIXTechTips
[3525.74 --> 3527.50]  lots more NCIXTechTips
[3527.50 --> 3528.48]  I guess that's the only thing
[3528.48 --> 3529.78]  we didn't really clarify
[3529.78 --> 3531.04]  that much
[3531.04 --> 3533.36]  to be honest
[3533.36 --> 3534.24]  I don't like running out
[3534.24 --> 3535.10]  of Linus videos
[3535.10 --> 3536.22]  neither do we
[3536.22 --> 3537.90]  we need more Linus videos too
[3537.90 --> 3539.72]  you're making it
[3539.72 --> 3540.74]  for the YouTube money
[3540.74 --> 3541.66]  you know what
[3541.66 --> 3542.32]  the YouTube money
[3542.32 --> 3543.34]  is not that
[3543.34 --> 3544.10]  yeah
[3544.10 --> 3545.72]  if your name is
[3545.72 --> 3546.76]  Freddie Wong
[3546.76 --> 3548.20]  Phil DeFranco
[3548.20 --> 3549.44]  Ray William Johnson
[3549.44 --> 3550.76]  PewDiePie
[3550.76 --> 3551.40]  is that a name
[3551.40 --> 3551.60]  Jenna Marbles
[3551.60 --> 3552.40]  PewDiePie
[3552.40 --> 3553.14]  Jenna Marbles
[3553.14 --> 3554.48]  if you're one of those
[3554.48 --> 3555.20]  five people
[3555.20 --> 3556.22]  then you can make things
[3556.22 --> 3556.90]  for YouTube money
[3556.90 --> 3557.76]  because it'll actually
[3557.76 --> 3559.86]  be a significant amount
[3559.86 --> 3560.24]  of money
[3560.24 --> 3561.42]  but you know
[3561.42 --> 3562.36]  without disclosing
[3562.36 --> 3563.52]  what the Google
[3563.52 --> 3564.82]  sort of revenue is
[3564.82 --> 3565.74]  because it's part of
[3565.74 --> 3566.46]  the terms of service
[3566.46 --> 3567.56]  that you cannot do that
[3567.56 --> 3569.30]  let me tell you
[3569.30 --> 3570.64]  do the math guys
[3570.64 --> 3571.72]  I have a staff of
[3571.72 --> 3572.42]  three people
[3572.42 --> 3573.26]  including myself
[3573.26 --> 3574.30]  how much money
[3574.30 --> 3575.48]  do you really think
[3575.48 --> 3576.82]  YouTube pays out
[3576.82 --> 3577.74]  and yeah
[3577.74 --> 3578.46]  there you go
[3578.46 --> 3582.78]  now that you're going in
[3582.78 --> 3584.84]  no I haven't
[3584.84 --> 3586.30]  but maybe I'll check that out actually
[3586.30 --> 3589.32]  good luck
[3589.32 --> 3589.90]  thank you
[3589.90 --> 3590.78]  thank you
[3590.78 --> 3593.14]  oh
[3593.14 --> 3594.26]  bought a cursor survivor
[3594.26 --> 3595.28]  still thanks to you
[3595.28 --> 3596.22]  and you know what
[3596.22 --> 3597.48]  this is what we want to do
[3597.48 --> 3599.36]  because as much as
[3599.36 --> 3599.72]  you know
[3599.72 --> 3600.92]  someone could come to us
[3600.92 --> 3601.40]  with
[3601.40 --> 3602.48]  you know
[3602.48 --> 3603.48]  the you know
[3603.48 --> 3604.46]  the Blackmagic
[3604.46 --> 3605.68]  intensity pro
[3605.68 --> 3607.60]  and ask us to come up with
[3607.60 --> 3608.90]  sort of a really cool
[3608.90 --> 3610.28]  ad for it
[3610.28 --> 3611.32]  we actually
[3611.32 --> 3611.84]  put things in
[3611.84 --> 3612.90]  and have them not work
[3612.90 --> 3613.58]  consistently
[3613.58 --> 3614.34]  yeah I know right
[3614.34 --> 3615.12]  be always late
[3615.12 --> 3616.10]  for your live stream
[3616.10 --> 3617.92]  not only not work
[3617.92 --> 3618.50]  consistently
[3618.50 --> 3620.16]  if that's not enough for you
[3620.16 --> 3621.80]  your whole computer can crash
[3621.80 --> 3625.76]  it's been endless hours debugging
[3625.76 --> 3627.82]  how much fun will that be
[3627.82 --> 3630.40]  you're gonna love my nuts
[3630.40 --> 3632.54]  yay Vince
[3632.54 --> 3634.64]  but yeah
[3634.64 --> 3635.94]  we're looking to find things
[3635.94 --> 3637.64]  that we actually do believe in
[3637.64 --> 3638.36]  I mean
[3638.36 --> 3638.88]  okay
[3638.88 --> 3640.08]  you probably haven't heard me
[3640.08 --> 3641.60]  recommend the Vengeance 2000
[3641.60 --> 3643.54]  to a lot of people
[3643.54 --> 3644.70]  but that's not because
[3644.70 --> 3645.56]  it's a bad product
[3645.56 --> 3646.88]  I just happen to have
[3646.88 --> 3647.66]  a personal preference
[3647.66 --> 3648.48]  that's something else
[3648.48 --> 3650.52]  Vengeance 2000 is an excellent product
[3650.52 --> 3651.74]  have you listened to them?
[3652.78 --> 3654.02]  aren't they the same drivers
[3654.02 --> 3655.70]  as the
[3655.70 --> 3656.06]  whatever the heck the other ones
[3656.06 --> 3657.20]  they sounded a little better
[3657.20 --> 3658.40]  than the 1500s to me
[3658.40 --> 3658.76]  I don't
[3658.76 --> 3659.94]  maybe it was my imagination
[3659.94 --> 3661.70]  I have not directly tried the 2000
[3661.70 --> 3662.52]  but it's one of those things
[3662.52 --> 3663.48]  where if people ask me
[3663.48 --> 3664.76]  which wireless headset to buy
[3664.76 --> 3665.78]  well that's what I'll say
[3665.78 --> 3667.48]  depends where their price range is
[3667.48 --> 3667.80]  for me
[3667.80 --> 3669.08]  I think they're around $149
[3669.08 --> 3669.92]  and it depends
[3669.92 --> 3670.94]  are you going for PC
[3670.94 --> 3671.94]  or are you going for
[3671.94 --> 3673.00]  like the home theater
[3673.00 --> 3674.02]  wireless style
[3674.02 --> 3675.38]  because there's a very big difference
[3675.38 --> 3676.72]  and there's a very big price delta
[3676.72 --> 3677.28]  oh yeah
[3677.28 --> 3678.10]  because home theater
[3678.10 --> 3679.82]  wireless stuff is not $150
[3679.82 --> 3681.30]  it's money
[3681.30 --> 3682.50]  and it's one of those things
[3682.50 --> 3683.56]  where you could say
[3683.56 --> 3684.66]  until you're blue in the face
[3684.66 --> 3685.60]  that you know
[3685.60 --> 3686.60]  some component
[3686.60 --> 3688.30]  is optimized for gaming
[3688.30 --> 3689.58]  because it's got like
[3689.58 --> 3690.26]  a stripe on it
[3690.26 --> 3690.94]  or whatever else
[3690.94 --> 3692.26]  but you actually can
[3692.26 --> 3693.22]  optimize a peripheral
[3693.22 --> 3693.76]  for gaming
[3693.76 --> 3694.92]  something like a headset
[3694.92 --> 3695.86]  okay
[3695.86 --> 3697.32]  Corsair might make a compromise
[3697.32 --> 3697.90]  like
[3697.90 --> 3698.88]  we need a slightly lower
[3698.88 --> 3699.70]  latency connection
[3699.70 --> 3700.10]  so
[3700.10 --> 3701.64]  we're going to lose
[3701.64 --> 3702.44]  a little bit of
[3702.44 --> 3702.98]  bandwidth
[3702.98 --> 3704.46]  or whatever other trade-offs
[3704.46 --> 3705.02]  they might make
[3705.02 --> 3705.92]  so that's where
[3705.92 --> 3706.52]  I would actually say
[3706.52 --> 3707.08]  okay yes
[3707.08 --> 3708.42]  go with the actual
[3708.42 --> 3709.74]  gaming wireless headset
[3709.74 --> 3710.80]  if you want wireless
[3710.80 --> 3712.08]  so anyway
[3712.08 --> 3712.50]  yeah
[3712.50 --> 3713.60]  so I'm glad you bought
[3713.60 --> 3714.28]  a Survivor Stealth
[3714.28 --> 3715.82]  because it is a fantastic product
[3715.82 --> 3716.78]  and I'm glad that our video
[3716.78 --> 3717.70]  got that point across
[3717.70 --> 3721.86]  nope
[3721.86 --> 3722.28]  nope
[3722.28 --> 3724.80]  NCIXcom is going strong
[3724.80 --> 3725.70]  so there seems to be
[3725.70 --> 3727.00]  a lot of misconceptions
[3727.00 --> 3728.14]  about that
[3728.14 --> 3729.18]  we just didn't bring it up
[3729.18 --> 3729.94]  there's no intention
[3729.94 --> 3731.42]  of stopping NCIXcom
[3731.42 --> 3731.80]  in fact
[3731.80 --> 3732.84]  not only no intention
[3732.84 --> 3735.08]  there is a long term plan
[3735.08 --> 3736.98]  that it is not going away
[3736.98 --> 3737.42]  yep
[3737.42 --> 3738.54]  um
[3738.54 --> 3740.48]  uh
[3740.48 --> 3740.84]  nope
[3740.84 --> 3742.20]  um
[3742.20 --> 3743.18]  delaying something
[3743.18 --> 3744.40]  to make sure that it's good
[3744.40 --> 3745.08]  is not a problem
[3745.08 --> 3745.46]  yeah that's
[3745.46 --> 3746.00]  that's fine
[3746.00 --> 3747.40]  I would way rather
[3747.40 --> 3748.52]  that they delayed it
[3748.52 --> 3749.52]  and fixed any problems
[3749.52 --> 3750.10]  than releasing
[3750.10 --> 3750.96]  a shoddy
[3750.96 --> 3752.04]  terrible product
[3752.04 --> 3753.18]  this happened
[3753.18 --> 3753.82]  with War Z
[3753.82 --> 3754.76]  have you heard of War Z
[3754.76 --> 3756.48]  they were
[3756.48 --> 3757.28]  it's a video game
[3757.28 --> 3758.00]  based on zombies
[3758.00 --> 3758.40]  whatever
[3758.40 --> 3759.24]  don't worry about it
[3759.24 --> 3759.92]  like Daisy
[3759.92 --> 3762.98]  pretty freaking similar
[3762.98 --> 3763.60]  oh okay
[3763.60 --> 3763.90]  sure
[3763.90 --> 3764.18]  um
[3764.18 --> 3765.66]  Daisy is uh
[3765.66 --> 3766.72]  built into a game
[3766.72 --> 3767.60]  War Z is a standalone
[3767.60 --> 3768.66]  Daisy is a flower
[3768.66 --> 3769.36]  Daisy
[3769.36 --> 3772.38]  uh
[3772.38 --> 3777.20]  Daisy is a mod
[3777.20 --> 3777.92]  for Armour 2
[3777.92 --> 3778.90]  they're planning on
[3778.90 --> 3779.68]  making it a standalone
[3779.68 --> 3780.60]  War Z was
[3780.60 --> 3781.12]  a standalone
[3781.12 --> 3781.62]  I don't even know
[3781.62 --> 3782.34]  if they still exist
[3782.34 --> 3782.86]  anyways
[3782.86 --> 3784.02]  they had a pretty rough
[3784.02 --> 3784.54]  alpha stage
[3784.54 --> 3785.10]  but were doing
[3785.10 --> 3785.82]  pretty okay
[3785.82 --> 3786.68]  a lot of people
[3786.68 --> 3787.40]  kind of liked it
[3787.40 --> 3788.32]  and then they were like
[3788.32 --> 3788.66]  nope
[3788.66 --> 3789.42]  full release
[3789.42 --> 3790.38]  and then it was
[3790.38 --> 3791.38]  so bad
[3791.38 --> 3792.26]  that Steam
[3792.26 --> 3792.82]  pulled it
[3792.82 --> 3794.74]  I don't think
[3794.74 --> 3796.16]  as far as I know
[3796.16 --> 3796.64]  I don't know
[3796.64 --> 3798.06]  I don't know
[3798.06 --> 3798.90]  of any other game
[3798.90 --> 3799.30]  that they have
[3799.30 --> 3800.10]  they probably have
[3800.10 --> 3800.60]  but I don't
[3800.60 --> 3801.26]  I've never heard
[3801.26 --> 3801.86]  of any other game
[3801.86 --> 3802.28]  that Steam pulled
[3802.28 --> 3802.64]  well there was
[3802.64 --> 3803.40]  probably one with
[3803.40 --> 3804.76]  like full frontal nudity
[3804.76 --> 3805.22]  or something
[3805.22 --> 3806.08]  that slipped through
[3806.08 --> 3806.68]  the filter
[3806.68 --> 3807.28]  or something
[3807.28 --> 3807.64]  but like
[3807.64 --> 3808.16]  you know
[3808.16 --> 3809.12]  three people bought it
[3809.12 --> 3809.92]  but not because
[3809.92 --> 3810.70]  Steam was like
[3810.70 --> 3811.94]  this game sucks
[3811.94 --> 3812.74]  too much
[3812.74 --> 3814.24]  like
[3814.24 --> 3815.58]  like
[3815.58 --> 3816.84]  holy cow
[3816.84 --> 3817.88]  so like
[3817.88 --> 3818.64]  I would rather
[3818.64 --> 3819.48]  that you actually
[3819.48 --> 3820.24]  go through
[3820.24 --> 3821.22]  the R&D
[3821.22 --> 3821.78]  I would rather
[3821.78 --> 3822.26]  that you actually
[3822.26 --> 3823.10]  perfected your product
[3823.10 --> 3824.10]  and then released it
[3824.10 --> 3824.56]  instead of
[3824.56 --> 3825.46]  releasing something shiny
[3825.46 --> 3826.12]  and remember guys
[3826.12 --> 3827.20]  it's not like
[3827.20 --> 3828.00]  Nvidia has
[3828.00 --> 3829.10]  700 series
[3829.10 --> 3830.16]  on the shelves
[3830.16 --> 3831.04]  so
[3831.04 --> 3832.60]  okay
[3832.60 --> 3833.38]  so there's no
[3833.38 --> 3834.42]  real pressure
[3834.42 --> 3835.48]  they can still sell
[3835.48 --> 3837.16]  7000 series graphics cards
[3837.16 --> 3838.14]  right now
[3838.14 --> 3839.12]  which is fine
[3839.12 --> 3840.18]  and they delayed that
[3840.18 --> 3840.86]  but dropped their
[3840.86 --> 3842.06]  Never Settle bundle
[3842.06 --> 3842.34]  yeah
[3842.34 --> 3843.22]  which is awesome
[3843.22 --> 3844.24]  which is pretty epic
[3844.24 --> 3844.98]  so which is a pretty good
[3844.98 --> 3845.94]  incentive to go buy
[3845.94 --> 3847.12]  a 7000 series card
[3847.12 --> 3848.12]  as we discussed before
[3848.12 --> 3848.92]  and they're benching
[3848.92 --> 3849.50]  really well
[3849.50 --> 3850.34]  yeah
[3850.34 --> 3851.12]  they're benching
[3851.12 --> 3851.64]  really well
[3851.64 --> 3852.54]  the Far Cry 3
[3852.54 --> 3853.54]  benchmarks we ran
[3853.54 --> 3853.92]  like
[3853.92 --> 3856.74]  at every price point
[3856.74 --> 3857.76]  AMD just
[3857.76 --> 3859.20]  cleaned house
[3859.20 --> 3860.54]  and sneak preview
[3860.54 --> 3860.98]  Starcraft
[3860.98 --> 3861.86]  sneak preview
[3861.86 --> 3862.86]  yeah Starcraft 2
[3862.86 --> 3863.76]  we're doing
[3863.76 --> 3864.60]  the same kind of style
[3864.60 --> 3865.58]  as we did with Far Cry 3
[3865.58 --> 3866.38]  but with Starcraft 2
[3866.38 --> 3866.98]  so we're going to show
[3866.98 --> 3867.82]  head to head competition
[3867.82 --> 3868.36]  and then we're going to
[3868.36 --> 3869.06]  show my benchmark
[3869.06 --> 3869.74]  were you supposed to
[3869.74 --> 3870.52]  get that done this week
[3870.52 --> 3871.82]  it is done
[3871.82 --> 3873.74]  we were supposed to
[3873.74 --> 3874.22]  film it
[3874.22 --> 3876.28]  that's your fault
[3876.28 --> 3877.06]  alright
[3877.06 --> 3878.42]  fine
[3878.42 --> 3880.96]  I was busy
[3880.96 --> 3882.10]  I know
[3882.10 --> 3882.80]  I'm just saying
[3882.80 --> 3884.08]  it's not my fault
[3884.08 --> 3886.12]  so anyway
[3886.12 --> 3886.92]  that's coming
[3886.92 --> 3888.06]  so AMD's doing good
[3888.06 --> 3889.70]  well I mean
[3889.70 --> 3890.52]  maybe not
[3890.52 --> 3891.18]  I guess I'll wait
[3891.18 --> 3891.88]  until it shows up
[3891.88 --> 3892.68]  well yeah but
[3892.68 --> 3894.38]  I mentioned your stream
[3894.38 --> 3895.34]  on Logan's live stream
[3895.34 --> 3896.22]  and he forwarded his viewers
[3896.22 --> 3896.74]  to your stream
[3896.74 --> 3897.28]  when you started
[3897.28 --> 3897.88]  yay Logan
[3897.88 --> 3899.14]  thanks Logan
[3899.14 --> 3899.84]  thanks Logan
[3899.84 --> 3901.76]  for y'all
[3901.76 --> 3902.20]  okay you know
[3902.20 --> 3903.04]  I should probably give him
[3903.04 --> 3904.06]  a proper shout out
[3904.06 --> 3905.16]  let's go to his YouTube channel
[3905.16 --> 3905.82]  for those of you
[3905.82 --> 3906.84]  who don't know
[3906.84 --> 3908.46]  who the Logan is
[3908.46 --> 3909.94]  and we are still working
[3909.94 --> 3912.24]  on sort of rerunning
[3912.24 --> 3913.08]  his experiment
[3913.08 --> 3915.48]  with 8350 versus 3570k
[3915.48 --> 3916.02]  we've just had
[3916.02 --> 3917.08]  a very busy week
[3917.08 --> 3918.42]  praise the world
[3918.42 --> 3919.80]  tax syndicate
[3919.80 --> 3921.76]  praise the world man
[3921.76 --> 3923.66]  I am going to make
[3923.66 --> 3924.74]  that video Logan
[3924.74 --> 3925.82]  if you see this
[3925.82 --> 3926.90]  we've just been
[3926.90 --> 3927.16]  ridiculously busy
[3927.16 --> 3928.08]  probably not watching
[3928.08 --> 3929.32]  why are you so full of yourself
[3929.32 --> 3931.56]  this is your channel
[3931.56 --> 3933.78]  can you make sure
[3933.78 --> 3934.58]  this is still working
[3934.58 --> 3936.46]  what's this doing
[3936.46 --> 3938.26]  boom boom boom
[3938.26 --> 3938.76]  okay
[3938.76 --> 3941.32]  okay
[3941.32 --> 3942.04]  in the meantime
[3942.04 --> 3943.28]  I'm going to
[3943.28 --> 3945.18]  Logan's YouTube channel
[3945.18 --> 3946.56]  where he does his
[3946.56 --> 3947.46]  I wish I was
[3947.46 --> 3947.98]  traditional
[3947.98 --> 3949.12]  well not
[3949.12 --> 3950.16]  more traditional
[3950.16 --> 3951.80]  but his traditional style
[3951.80 --> 3952.44]  where he does
[3952.44 --> 3953.62]  problems
[3953.62 --> 3954.64]  problems?
[3954.94 --> 3955.58]  what problems?
[3956.00 --> 3956.56]  ask
[3956.56 --> 3957.44]  ask you what's up
[3957.44 --> 3958.98]  oh uh oh
[3958.98 --> 3959.90]  wait what
[3959.90 --> 3960.62]  aren't you in the chat?
[3961.02 --> 3961.98]  yeah but I can't
[3961.98 --> 3962.30]  chat
[3962.30 --> 3963.04]  because I'm not logged in
[3963.04 --> 3963.92]  you gotta log into mine
[3963.92 --> 3965.56]  okay apparently
[3965.56 --> 3966.34]  there are problems
[3966.34 --> 3966.94]  but we don't know
[3966.94 --> 3967.48]  what they are
[3967.48 --> 3968.30]  it says we have
[3968.30 --> 3968.60]  viewers
[3968.60 --> 3969.38]  lag whoa
[3969.38 --> 3970.56]  lag?
[3970.82 --> 3971.04]  yeah
[3971.04 --> 3971.96]  oh okay
[3971.96 --> 3972.54]  how about now
[3972.54 --> 3973.48]  fixed?
[3973.48 --> 3976.04]  uh nope
[3976.04 --> 3976.98]  some people are saying
[3976.98 --> 3977.30]  it's fine
[3977.30 --> 3977.86]  some people are saying
[3977.86 --> 3978.38]  it's choppy
[3978.38 --> 3980.14]  it is a little choppy
[3980.14 --> 3981.04]  I don't think
[3981.04 --> 3981.46]  there's anything
[3981.46 --> 3982.28]  we can do about that
[3982.28 --> 3982.66]  though I think
[3982.66 --> 3983.26]  it may actually
[3983.26 --> 3984.16]  be related to
[3984.16 --> 3984.88]  the um
[3984.88 --> 3986.98]  I think it may
[3986.98 --> 3987.82]  actually be related
[3987.82 --> 3989.18]  to the Avermedia card
[3989.18 --> 3990.06]  I think it's just
[3990.06 --> 3991.02]  when you open the browser
[3991.02 --> 3991.98]  is it?
[3992.06 --> 3993.12]  remember how choppy it was
[3993.12 --> 3993.72]  when I tried to do
[3993.72 --> 3994.52]  the 3D thing
[3994.52 --> 3995.04]  okay
[3995.04 --> 3996.30]  so anyway
[3996.30 --> 3997.26]  uh so we're not gonna
[3997.26 --> 3998.42]  do anything in the browser
[3998.42 --> 3999.20]  we're just gonna show you
[3999.20 --> 3999.88]  a static image
[3999.88 --> 4000.20]  but
[4000.20 --> 4001.16]  tech syndicate

[4012.70 --> 4014.42]  he covers all the topics though
[4014.42 --> 4015.00]  I like them
[4015.00 --> 4016.24]  I actually really like them
[4016.24 --> 4016.80]  um okay
[4016.80 --> 4018.32]  so moving right along
[4018.32 --> 4019.70]  uh back to
[4019.70 --> 4020.86]  back to the twitter
[4020.86 --> 4022.96]  uh
[4022.96 --> 4025.12]  congrats on the new
[4025.12 --> 4026.02]  youtube channel
[4026.02 --> 4026.52]  mentioned
[4026.52 --> 4027.98]  okay
[4027.98 --> 4029.36]  what about nvidia titan
[4029.36 --> 4030.20]  okay we did promise
[4030.20 --> 4031.10]  a discussion topic
[4031.10 --> 4031.70]  about this
[4031.70 --> 4033.28]  so what about
[4033.28 --> 4034.46]  nvidia titan
[4034.46 --> 4036.64]  why
[4036.64 --> 4037.34]  what are you doing
[4037.34 --> 4039.42]  that's okay
[4039.42 --> 4040.12]  it's got rubber feet
[4040.12 --> 4040.72]  on the bottom of it
[4040.72 --> 4041.66]  I put it down on top
[4041.66 --> 4043.54]  of my freshly painted case
[4043.54 --> 4044.88]  and yeah
[4044.88 --> 4046.12]  that's really really choppy
[4046.12 --> 4046.96]  guys there's nothing
[4046.96 --> 4047.86]  we can do about it
[4047.86 --> 4049.32]  it's choppy on our screen too
[4049.32 --> 4051.24]  we'll just try to move less
[4051.24 --> 4052.88]  so that it's not as noticeable
[4052.88 --> 4054.32]  but uh
[4054.32 --> 4054.86]  for those of you
[4054.86 --> 4055.60]  who have suggested
[4055.60 --> 4056.52]  some um
[4056.52 --> 4058.28]  alternative broadcasting
[4058.28 --> 4059.26]  software suites
[4059.26 --> 4060.60]  we are considering it
[4060.60 --> 4061.94]  and when we have time
[4061.94 --> 4062.68]  to sit down
[4062.68 --> 4063.70]  and actually try them
[4063.70 --> 4064.58]  we will
[4064.58 --> 4065.80]  we will try and find a way
[4065.80 --> 4066.78]  to get that done
[4066.78 --> 4067.76]  the bad news
[4067.76 --> 4068.76]  is that we can't
[4068.76 --> 4069.86]  just stop the live stream
[4069.86 --> 4070.68]  and start it up again
[4070.68 --> 4071.90]  and see if that fixes it
[4071.90 --> 4073.08]  because then we're gonna
[4073.08 --> 4073.76]  have to convert
[4073.76 --> 4074.50]  all of the media
[4074.50 --> 4075.14]  in order to
[4075.14 --> 4076.94]  put it back together
[4076.94 --> 4077.74]  and upload it after
[4077.74 --> 4078.86]  and we'd really like to
[4078.86 --> 4079.72]  well
[4079.72 --> 4080.84]  Slick needs to go home
[4080.84 --> 4081.38]  and go to bed
[4081.38 --> 4082.26]  and I need to go to bed
[4082.26 --> 4082.54]  so
[4082.54 --> 4083.46]  yeah
[4083.46 --> 4084.76]  um
[4084.76 --> 4085.54]  where were we
[4085.54 --> 4086.26]  Nvidia Titan
[4086.26 --> 4086.62]  right
[4086.62 --> 4088.92]  uh
[4088.92 --> 4089.86]  there's tons of rumors
[4089.86 --> 4090.56]  I've read rumors
[4090.56 --> 4091.34]  saying that it's
[4091.34 --> 4092.96]  a standalone release
[4092.96 --> 4093.60]  I've read rumors
[4093.60 --> 4094.72]  saying that it's 780
[4094.72 --> 4095.36]  I've read
[4095.36 --> 4096.62]  I've read
[4096.62 --> 4096.96]  I've read
[4096.96 --> 4097.26]  I've read
[4097.26 --> 4097.54]  I've read
[4097.54 --> 4097.82]  I've read
[4097.82 --> 4099.18]  I've seen benchmarks
[4099.18 --> 4100.40]  that are apparently it
[4100.40 --> 4101.52]  that are incredible
[4101.52 --> 4102.44]  but who knows
[4102.44 --> 4103.30]  if they're partially
[4103.30 --> 4103.84]  fabricated
[4103.84 --> 4104.66]  who knows if they're real
[4104.66 --> 4105.46]  who knows if blah blah blah
[4105.46 --> 4106.90]  we've received no actual
[4106.90 --> 4107.50]  information
[4107.50 --> 4108.40]  and signed no
[4108.40 --> 4109.46]  non-disclosure agreement
[4109.46 --> 4110.20]  about this product
[4110.20 --> 4110.76]  so we're
[4110.76 --> 4112.60]  we're open to speculate
[4112.60 --> 4113.42]  so
[4113.42 --> 4115.34]  I'm expecting it to be
[4115.34 --> 4116.72]  something along the lines
[4116.72 --> 4118.32]  of what 480 was
[4118.32 --> 4120.04]  it's gonna be
[4120.04 --> 4120.56]  it's gonna have
[4120.56 --> 4121.52]  high power consumption
[4121.52 --> 4122.70]  it's gonna have
[4122.70 --> 4123.54]  a lot of heat output
[4123.54 --> 4124.60]  well it's a GK110
[4124.60 --> 4125.90]  it's a GK110
[4125.90 --> 4126.80]  so yuck
[4126.80 --> 4128.30]  so it's a big old core
[4128.30 --> 4130.14]  on the other hand
[4130.14 --> 4131.60]  GTX 480 was
[4131.60 --> 4133.28]  pretty ballin' fast
[4133.28 --> 4134.18]  compared to the
[4134.18 --> 4135.42]  previous generation 280
[4135.42 --> 4136.58]  I've got kind of a
[4136.58 --> 4137.56]  for GTX 480
[4137.56 --> 4138.72]  that was the biggest
[4138.72 --> 4139.76]  generational leap
[4139.76 --> 4140.38]  we've seen
[4140.38 --> 4141.22]  in a while
[4141.22 --> 4141.80]  since
[4141.80 --> 4143.06]  since probably
[4143.06 --> 4143.76]  8800
[4143.76 --> 4144.42]  yep
[4144.42 --> 4146.34]  so I'm expecting
[4146.34 --> 4146.92]  another
[4146.92 --> 4148.68]  big generational leap
[4148.68 --> 4152.72]  I'm expecting
[4152.72 --> 4154.42]  a big price tag
[4154.42 --> 4156.04]  the rumors
[4156.04 --> 4156.72]  that I've
[4156.72 --> 4157.46]  that I've seen
[4157.46 --> 4158.04]  have
[4158.04 --> 4159.14]  GTX
[4159.14 --> 4160.36]  whatever it's gonna be called
[4160.36 --> 4161.06]  have Titan
[4161.06 --> 4162.14]  coming in
[4162.14 --> 4163.00]  at more like
[4163.00 --> 4163.64]  a replacement
[4163.64 --> 4165.12]  for 690
[4165.12 --> 4166.32]  as opposed
[4166.32 --> 4166.90]  to a replacement
[4166.90 --> 4167.74]  for 680
[4167.74 --> 4169.20]  which doesn't necessarily
[4169.20 --> 4170.18]  indicate anything
[4170.18 --> 4171.16]  about performance
[4171.16 --> 4171.48]  although
[4171.48 --> 4172.14]  maybe
[4172.14 --> 4173.12]  maybe it performs
[4173.12 --> 4173.58]  similarly
[4173.58 --> 4174.66]  but it's a single GPU
[4174.66 --> 4175.66]  so you don't have to deal
[4175.66 --> 4176.68]  with any driver nonsense
[4176.68 --> 4178.92]  I think people are
[4178.92 --> 4179.96]  dropping off the live stream
[4179.96 --> 4180.66]  because of the chop
[4180.66 --> 4181.74]  well it's still 2600
[4181.74 --> 4182.00]  actually
[4182.00 --> 4182.56]  that's not bad
[4182.56 --> 4184.06]  but
[4184.06 --> 4185.74]  I'm expecting it
[4185.74 --> 4186.08]  to come in
[4186.08 --> 4187.00]  at a similar price point
[4187.00 --> 4187.42]  you know
[4187.42 --> 4188.50]  I get people asking me
[4188.50 --> 4189.06]  stuff like this
[4189.06 --> 4189.56]  all the time
[4189.56 --> 4189.88]  minus
[4189.88 --> 4190.72]  how much do you think
[4190.72 --> 4191.42]  Intel's upcoming
[4191.42 --> 4193.06]  4770k will cost
[4193.06 --> 4194.08]  how much do you think
[4194.08 --> 4194.82]  their next generation
[4194.82 --> 4195.40]  extreme edition
[4195.40 --> 4195.94]  will cost
[4195.94 --> 4197.06]  and I can't answer
[4197.06 --> 4197.60]  those questions
[4197.60 --> 4198.48]  because I'm under NDA
[4198.48 --> 4199.64]  but what I can say
[4199.64 --> 4200.24]  like I'm under
[4200.24 --> 4201.46]  sort of a general NDA
[4201.46 --> 4202.96]  because if I could
[4202.96 --> 4203.68]  know the answer
[4203.68 --> 4204.44]  then I could get in
[4204.44 --> 4205.12]  trouble for saying
[4205.12 --> 4205.94]  the actual answer
[4205.94 --> 4207.52]  but come on guys
[4207.52 --> 4208.94]  it's the same thing
[4208.94 --> 4209.88]  every time
[4209.88 --> 4211.02]  like look at what
[4211.02 --> 4212.56]  a 2600k cost
[4212.56 --> 4212.96]  look at what
[4212.96 --> 4214.34]  a 3770k cost
[4214.34 --> 4214.80]  how much do you think
[4214.80 --> 4215.42]  the replacement's
[4215.42 --> 4216.02]  going to cost
[4216.02 --> 4217.90]  approximately the same
[4217.90 --> 4219.54]  like look at what
[4219.54 --> 4220.42]  a 590k cost
[4220.42 --> 4220.74]  look at what
[4220.74 --> 4221.54]  a 690k cost
[4221.54 --> 4222.04]  how much do you think
[4222.04 --> 4222.94]  a Titan's going to cost
[4222.94 --> 4223.58]  999
[4223.58 --> 4226.56]  I don't know
[4226.56 --> 4228.02]  and then I'd expect
[4228.02 --> 4229.08]  performance to be
[4229.08 --> 4229.94]  something along
[4229.94 --> 4230.50]  okay look
[4230.50 --> 4231.66]  look at what
[4231.66 --> 4232.82]  the stack was
[4232.82 --> 4234.08]  designed to be
[4234.08 --> 4234.94]  the code names
[4234.94 --> 4235.68]  tell the story
[4235.68 --> 4237.12]  GK110
[4237.12 --> 4238.78]  was supposed to be
[4238.78 --> 4240.02]  to GK114
[4240.02 --> 4241.56]  what GK100
[4241.56 --> 4242.30]  was
[4242.30 --> 4244.70]  to GK104
[4244.70 --> 4246.26]  oh is that the problem
[4246.26 --> 4248.84]  no that's the audio
[4248.84 --> 4249.34]  problem
[4249.34 --> 4250.26]  there's an audio
[4250.26 --> 4250.68]  problem
[4250.68 --> 4251.24]  has that been open
[4251.24 --> 4251.80]  the whole time
[4251.80 --> 4252.62]  it's been open
[4252.62 --> 4253.44]  since you checked it
[4253.44 --> 4255.90]  oh seriously
[4255.90 --> 4257.64]  oh sorry guys
[4257.64 --> 4258.46]  um
[4258.46 --> 4260.22]  wait where was I
[4260.22 --> 4263.44]  everything's the same
[4263.44 --> 4264.56]  oh yeah
[4264.56 --> 4265.56]  it's the same
[4265.56 --> 4268.28]  yeah
[4268.28 --> 4269.16]  yeah
[4269.16 --> 4271.22]  so right
[4271.22 --> 4272.00]  so how much
[4272.00 --> 4273.16]  is the next generation
[4273.16 --> 4274.14]  one going to cost
[4274.14 --> 4275.06]  it's going to cost
[4275.06 --> 4276.02]  about as much
[4276.02 --> 4276.98]  as that
[4276.98 --> 4278.26]  and then sometimes
[4278.26 --> 4278.70]  there will be
[4278.70 --> 4279.40]  halo parts
[4279.40 --> 4280.48]  and people always
[4280.48 --> 4281.26]  act like it's the
[4281.26 --> 4282.06]  first time they've
[4282.06 --> 4282.68]  seen something
[4282.68 --> 4284.38]  like when GTX 590
[4284.38 --> 4285.04]  launched for a
[4285.04 --> 4285.72]  thousand dollars
[4285.72 --> 4286.34]  people were like
[4286.34 --> 4288.94]  did you forget
[4288.94 --> 4290.18]  about 8800 Ultra
[4290.18 --> 4292.38]  that was a 999
[4292.38 --> 4292.92]  part
[4292.92 --> 4295.32]  did you forget
[4295.32 --> 4297.86]  about 5800 Ultra
[4297.86 --> 4299.66]  I mean that was
[4299.66 --> 4300.94]  what like a 799
[4300.94 --> 4301.86]  part but that was
[4301.86 --> 4302.82]  like 10 12 years
[4302.82 --> 4303.46]  ago however long
[4303.46 --> 4304.08]  ago that was
[4304.08 --> 4305.68]  so yeah
[4305.68 --> 4308.10]  these things happen
[4308.10 --> 4309.68]  things are expensive
[4309.68 --> 4311.20]  but in terms of pricing
[4311.20 --> 4312.32]  they come in at
[4312.32 --> 4313.20]  you know whatever
[4313.20 --> 4314.08]  they're replacing
[4314.08 --> 4315.24]  approximately plus or
[4315.24 --> 4315.52]  minus
[4315.52 --> 4317.28]  because that's
[4317.28 --> 4318.84]  what they do
[4318.84 --> 4319.68]  I don't remember
[4319.68 --> 4320.14]  where I was going
[4320.14 --> 4320.46]  with that
[4320.46 --> 4321.22]  so I'm just kind of
[4321.22 --> 4322.00]  ad-libbing right now
[4322.00 --> 4322.98]  this is pretty much it
[4322.98 --> 4323.18]  though
[4323.18 --> 4324.02]  we haven't we
[4324.02 --> 4324.76]  honestly haven't
[4324.76 --> 4325.50]  received anything
[4325.50 --> 4326.44]  we don't have any
[4326.44 --> 4327.84]  right yes the code
[4327.84 --> 4328.94]  names tell the story
[4328.94 --> 4330.20]  I'm expecting
[4330.20 --> 4332.26]  GK110 to be as
[4332.26 --> 4333.04]  much faster
[4333.04 --> 4335.26]  than GK114
[4335.26 --> 4336.16]  which is what
[4336.16 --> 4337.18]  680, 670
[4337.18 --> 4338.06]  and 660 Ti
[4338.06 --> 4338.72]  are based on
[4338.72 --> 4340.58]  as GK100 was
[4340.58 --> 4342.76]  versus GK104
[4342.76 --> 4345.00]  which is 580, 570
[4345.00 --> 4346.78]  versus 560 Ti
[4346.78 --> 4347.74]  and 560
[4347.74 --> 4349.04]  so that's the
[4349.04 --> 4349.72]  kind of improvement
[4349.72 --> 4350.66]  I'm expecting to see
[4350.66 --> 4351.88]  so that's the same
[4351.88 --> 4352.54]  sort of improvement
[4352.54 --> 4353.40]  we see when we go
[4353.40 --> 4354.76]  from a 480 to a 580
[4354.76 --> 4355.60]  to a 680
[4355.60 --> 4356.90]  except that it's
[4356.90 --> 4357.54]  kind of the same
[4357.54 --> 4358.16]  sort of improvement
[4358.16 --> 4359.34]  you have from a 480
[4359.34 --> 4360.72]  down to a 460
[4360.72 --> 4361.62]  and from a 580
[4361.62 --> 4362.44]  down to a 560
[4362.44 --> 4363.06]  and from a 680
[4363.06 --> 4364.62]  down to a 660
[4364.62 --> 4365.26]  non-Ti
[4365.26 --> 4365.96]  because that's the
[4365.96 --> 4366.60]  one that's an actual
[4366.60 --> 4367.42]  different GPU
[4367.42 --> 4368.68]  which is GK106
[4368.68 --> 4369.46]  which like
[4369.46 --> 4370.94]  so there
[4370.94 --> 4371.96]  I'm expecting it
[4371.96 --> 4372.78]  to be about
[4372.78 --> 4374.66]  80% faster
[4374.66 --> 4377.18]  than a GTX 680
[4377.18 --> 4377.82]  don't quote me
[4377.82 --> 4378.48]  on that though
[4378.48 --> 4380.28]  do you have any
[4380.28 --> 4380.82]  more topics?
[4382.00 --> 4382.74]  not particularly
[4382.74 --> 4383.74]  not kick my case
[4383.74 --> 4384.94]  I don't like that
[4384.94 --> 4385.68]  that thing flaps open
[4385.68 --> 4386.04]  all the time
[4386.04 --> 4386.54]  yeah me neither
[4386.54 --> 4387.36]  I'll have to figure out
[4387.36 --> 4387.96]  what to do about that
[4387.96 --> 4388.48]  I might just put a
[4388.48 --> 4389.10]  stronger magnet
[4389.10 --> 4389.80]  behind the thing
[4389.80 --> 4390.80]  that's probably good
[4390.80 --> 4391.68]  but then it won't be
[4391.68 --> 4392.42]  black wrinkle coated
[4392.42 --> 4393.22]  but if I get something
[4393.22 --> 4393.90]  shiny silver
[4393.90 --> 4394.92]  then it should be okay
[4394.92 --> 4395.92]  should we maybe show them
[4395.92 --> 4396.60]  what we're talking about?
[4396.82 --> 4397.28]  no it's okay
[4397.28 --> 4397.76]  they don't care
[4397.76 --> 4398.72]  you just don't want to
[4398.72 --> 4399.24]  show them the
[4399.24 --> 4400.66]  small imperfection of your case?
[4401.36 --> 4401.94]  should you show them
[4401.94 --> 4402.78]  some people are saying
[4402.78 --> 4404.86]  refresh the Avermedia
[4404.86 --> 4407.08]  a right click
[4407.08 --> 4408.66]  and then click refresh?
[4409.78 --> 4410.90]  yeah there's no refresh
[4410.90 --> 4411.70]  there's no refresh
[4411.70 --> 4414.02]  you know what
[4414.02 --> 4418.80]  and it didn't work
[4418.80 --> 4419.30]  it's okay
[4419.30 --> 4420.04]  don't worry guys
[4420.04 --> 4420.66]  we'll figure it out
[4420.66 --> 4421.14]  some other time
[4421.14 --> 4421.84]  I don't have the latest
[4421.84 --> 4422.20]  drivers
[4422.20 --> 4423.04]  I have the one
[4423.04 --> 4424.48]  I have the last one
[4424.48 --> 4427.98]  so I'm gonna leave you
[4427.98 --> 4428.88]  to just kind of
[4428.88 --> 4429.64]  flounder
[4429.64 --> 4431.82]  oh we should
[4431.82 --> 4432.22]  you know what
[4432.22 --> 4432.96]  we never actually
[4432.96 --> 4434.22]  stopped doing
[4434.22 --> 4435.48]  we never actually
[4435.48 --> 4436.10]  finished doing
[4436.10 --> 4436.76]  as much twitter
[4436.76 --> 4437.58]  as I wanted to do
[4437.58 --> 4438.30]  about the whole
[4438.30 --> 4440.92]  also Windows 8 giveaway
[4440.92 --> 4441.60]  yep we won't forget
[4441.60 --> 4442.14]  about that
[4442.14 --> 4443.68]  you remind me of
[4443.68 --> 4444.14]  Vince from the
[4444.14 --> 4444.96]  Slab Chop commercial
[4444.96 --> 4445.60]  thank you
[4445.60 --> 4446.32]  that's what the quote
[4446.32 --> 4446.74]  is for
[4446.74 --> 4447.06]  yes
[4447.06 --> 4449.00]  can't wait to see
[4449.00 --> 4449.70]  some of the techquickie
[4449.70 --> 4450.02]  videos
[4450.02 --> 4450.56]  well you could go
[4450.56 --> 4451.10]  there right now
[4451.10 --> 4452.10]  youtube.com slash
[4452.10 --> 4452.64]  techquickie
[4452.64 --> 4454.08]  or hopefully in like
[4454.08 --> 4455.46]  17 minutes
[4455.46 --> 4457.70]  yeah hopefully in a little bit
[4457.70 --> 4458.58]  good luck to you
[4458.58 --> 4459.06]  in your new biz
[4459.06 --> 4459.64]  thank you
[4459.64 --> 4460.90]  congrats
[4460.90 --> 4461.64]  thank you
[4461.64 --> 4465.70]  that's not what
[4465.70 --> 4466.00]  they're called
[4466.00 --> 4466.86]  fast as possible
[4466.86 --> 4467.74]  does not actually
[4467.74 --> 4468.64]  shorten to fat
[4468.64 --> 4471.12]  obligatory
[4471.12 --> 4471.78]  what is the status
[4471.78 --> 4472.44]  of the personal rig
[4472.44 --> 4472.72]  upgrade
[4472.72 --> 4473.46]  go back and watch
[4473.46 --> 4473.98]  the archive
[4473.98 --> 4474.80]  because I gave a
[4474.80 --> 4475.60]  nice long update
[4475.60 --> 4476.10]  at the beginning
[4476.10 --> 4476.52]  that's something
[4476.52 --> 4477.32]  they're talking about
[4477.32 --> 4478.86]  oh yeah
[4478.86 --> 4479.84]  Freddy's Kickstarter
[4479.84 --> 4481.50]  you know about this
[4481.50 --> 4482.30]  you guys were talking
[4482.30 --> 4482.72]  about it
[4482.72 --> 4484.26]  oh that makes
[4484.26 --> 4484.82]  a lot more sense
[4484.82 --> 4485.10]  yeah
[4485.10 --> 4485.98]  have you ever seen
[4485.98 --> 4486.72]  video game high school
[4486.72 --> 4487.44]  what
[4487.44 --> 4488.76]  yeah you don't really
[4488.76 --> 4489.42]  know about this
[4489.42 --> 4491.84]  carry on
[4491.84 --> 4493.40]  video game high school
[4493.40 --> 4494.68]  made by Freddy
[4494.68 --> 4495.36]  with a group
[4495.36 --> 4495.86]  that he made
[4495.86 --> 4496.78]  called Rocket Jump
[4496.78 --> 4498.22]  it features the dude
[4498.22 --> 4500.32]  from Epic Mealtime
[4500.32 --> 4500.94]  I can't remember his name
[4500.94 --> 4502.36]  you know what I'm saying
[4502.36 --> 4503.40]  some Canadian guy
[4503.40 --> 4503.92]  he eats bacon
[4503.92 --> 4504.94]  yeah
[4504.94 --> 4505.74]  features him
[4505.74 --> 4506.88]  it features the
[4506.88 --> 4508.76]  Brian Ferenzi
[4508.76 --> 4510.10]  from 5 Second Films
[4510.10 --> 4510.96]  he's freaking awesome
[4510.96 --> 4511.84]  like it's got a whole
[4511.84 --> 4512.30]  bunch of really
[4512.30 --> 4513.06]  really big youtubers
[4513.06 --> 4514.80]  and it's like a
[4514.80 --> 4516.02]  serious business show
[4516.02 --> 4517.04]  that they made
[4517.04 --> 4517.68]  and they made
[4517.68 --> 4518.52]  video game high school
[4518.52 --> 4519.52]  season 1
[4519.52 --> 4520.34]  check it out on
[4520.34 --> 4521.26]  I think just
[4521.26 --> 4522.38]  rocketjump.com
[4522.38 --> 4523.34]  or I think it's
[4523.34 --> 4524.02]  also on YouTube
[4524.02 --> 4525.88]  but they're starting
[4525.88 --> 4526.46]  a kickstarter
[4526.46 --> 4527.84]  to start season 2
[4527.84 --> 4528.58]  and season 2 is
[4528.58 --> 4529.60]  like they're adding
[4529.60 --> 4530.18]  a whole bunch of
[4530.18 --> 4530.56]  schools
[4530.56 --> 4531.50]  so it's not just
[4531.50 --> 4532.20]  video game high school
[4532.20 --> 4532.78]  like it's all these
[4532.78 --> 4533.58]  other different schools
[4533.58 --> 4534.96]  and they're thinking
[4534.96 --> 4535.52]  about spreading it
[4535.52 --> 4536.46]  to more games
[4536.46 --> 4537.50]  for season 1
[4537.50 --> 4538.20]  it was just FPS
[4538.20 --> 4540.48]  so yeah
[4540.48 --> 4541.04]  really interesting
[4541.04 --> 4541.96]  I think they might have
[4541.96 --> 4542.84]  passed their goal already
[4542.84 --> 4544.70]  but helping Freddy
[4544.70 --> 4545.24]  is like
[4545.24 --> 4546.94]  not a bad thing
[4546.94 --> 4547.76]  because he's kind of
[4547.76 --> 4548.32]  awesome
[4548.32 --> 4550.04]  kickstarting things
[4550.04 --> 4550.80]  is just sort of
[4550.80 --> 4551.30]  magical
[4551.30 --> 4552.62]  I love kickstarting
[4552.62 --> 4552.82]  it's like
[4552.82 --> 4553.18]  well
[4553.18 --> 4554.68]  it's fantastic
[4554.68 --> 4555.30]  okay here's what
[4555.30 --> 4555.66]  I don't
[4555.66 --> 4556.26]  okay
[4556.26 --> 4558.28]  it's hard to wrap
[4558.28 --> 4559.10]  my brain around
[4559.10 --> 4561.58]  why people get to
[4561.58 --> 4562.26]  start a business
[4562.26 --> 4563.62]  with just
[4563.62 --> 4564.66]  up front funding
[4564.66 --> 4565.66]  that they actually
[4565.66 --> 4566.98]  don't have to
[4566.98 --> 4568.90]  pay back
[4568.90 --> 4569.64]  in any way
[4569.64 --> 4570.32]  I mean it's like
[4570.32 --> 4570.96]  it's magical
[4570.96 --> 4572.00]  and it's good for
[4572.00 --> 4573.78]  you're buying a product
[4573.78 --> 4574.06]  though
[4574.06 --> 4575.32]  99% of the time
[4575.32 --> 4576.02]  when you do any
[4576.02 --> 4576.76]  kickstarter donation
[4576.76 --> 4577.72]  you're buying something
[4577.72 --> 4578.82]  yeah okay
[4578.82 --> 4579.82]  but you're buying
[4579.82 --> 4580.78]  something that
[4580.78 --> 4581.58]  it's like
[4581.58 --> 4584.12]  that isn't guaranteed yet
[4584.12 --> 4584.52]  yes
[4584.52 --> 4585.34]  no quality guarantee
[4585.34 --> 4585.82]  that kind of stuff
[4585.82 --> 4586.12]  yes
[4586.12 --> 4587.36]  almost every single
[4587.36 --> 4587.78]  kickstarter
[4587.78 --> 4588.60]  like video games
[4588.60 --> 4589.82]  are now not allowed
[4589.82 --> 4591.00]  showing anything
[4591.00 --> 4592.50]  other than
[4592.50 --> 4593.74]  actual what they have
[4593.74 --> 4594.24]  right now
[4594.24 --> 4595.34]  right
[4595.34 --> 4596.16]  so they can't be like
[4596.16 --> 4596.88]  this is theoretical
[4596.88 --> 4597.46]  footage
[4597.46 --> 4599.08]  this is video
[4599.08 --> 4600.02]  that our graphics
[4600.02 --> 4600.76]  designer made
[4600.76 --> 4601.38]  that has nothing
[4601.38 --> 4602.08]  to do with our game
[4602.08 --> 4602.60]  like that was
[4602.60 --> 4603.34]  happening a little bit
[4603.34 --> 4603.70]  at the beginning
[4603.70 --> 4604.18]  of kickstarter
[4604.18 --> 4604.54]  right
[4604.54 --> 4605.04]  and then kickstarter
[4605.04 --> 4605.48]  is just like
[4605.48 --> 4606.06]  no
[4606.06 --> 4607.16]  you can only release
[4607.16 --> 4607.72]  what you have
[4607.72 --> 4608.36]  now
[4608.36 --> 4609.14]  okay
[4609.14 --> 4610.82]  so any assets
[4610.82 --> 4611.42]  that you see on the
[4611.42 --> 4612.20]  page are current
[4612.20 --> 4612.72]  assets
[4612.72 --> 4613.94]  so what a lot of
[4613.94 --> 4614.50]  people have to do
[4614.50 --> 4615.58]  is start everything
[4615.58 --> 4616.12]  like they have to
[4616.12 --> 4616.82]  form their company
[4616.82 --> 4617.38]  they have to hire
[4617.38 --> 4618.10]  all the employees
[4618.10 --> 4619.18]  they have to basically
[4619.18 --> 4619.90]  do everything that
[4619.90 --> 4620.46]  you would have to do
[4620.46 --> 4620.86]  if you're going to
[4620.86 --> 4621.60]  bring something to a
[4621.60 --> 4622.96]  bank for a gigantic
[4622.96 --> 4623.42]  investment
[4623.42 --> 4624.28]  and then they get to
[4624.28 --> 4624.96]  put it on kickstarter
[4624.96 --> 4625.70]  and then they get to
[4625.70 --> 4626.28]  put it on kickstarter
[4626.28 --> 4627.30]  so it's usually
[4627.30 --> 4628.42]  very well
[4628.42 --> 4630.34]  properly organized
[4630.34 --> 4631.38]  pre-done things
[4631.38 --> 4631.96]  that are looking to
[4631.96 --> 4632.84]  funding to finish
[4632.84 --> 4633.46]  their project
[4633.46 --> 4635.28]  not always
[4635.28 --> 4636.74]  but usually
[4636.74 --> 4638.06]  so like
[4638.06 --> 4638.84]  we should do a
[4638.84 --> 4639.24]  kickstarter
[4639.24 --> 4640.78]  for like starting up
[4640.78 --> 4641.66]  a slicks tech tips
[4641.66 --> 4642.02]  channel
[4642.02 --> 4644.16]  we'll set the goal
[4644.16 --> 4644.82]  at something very
[4644.82 --> 4645.20]  reasonable
[4645.20 --> 4646.24]  like $500
[4646.24 --> 4647.32]  I was going to say
[4647.32 --> 4647.58]  $10
[4647.58 --> 4649.24]  it's not like we
[4649.24 --> 4649.84]  pay him much
[4649.84 --> 4650.82]  buy me a sandwich
[4650.82 --> 4651.84]  so I can survive
[4651.84 --> 4652.50]  and then we'll make
[4652.50 --> 4653.58]  a new youtube channel
[4653.58 --> 4654.88]  yeah
[4654.88 --> 4656.06]  no like
[4656.06 --> 4656.42]  okay
[4656.42 --> 4657.08]  when you're going
[4657.08 --> 4657.58]  on kickstarter
[4657.58 --> 4658.48]  kickstarter's awesome
[4658.48 --> 4659.56]  but be careful
[4659.56 --> 4661.06]  read what you're buying
[4661.06 --> 4661.68]  how about like a
[4661.68 --> 4662.12]  kickstarter
[4662.12 --> 4663.04]  for tattooing
[4663.04 --> 4663.80]  slick's face
[4663.80 --> 4664.66]  with like
[4664.66 --> 4665.62]  Darth Maul tattoos
[4665.62 --> 4666.06]  no
[4666.06 --> 4667.98]  unless we get like
[4667.98 --> 4668.80]  what if it was like
[4668.80 --> 4669.72]  a million dollars
[4669.72 --> 4670.50]  would you do it
[4670.50 --> 4672.34]  hmm
[4672.34 --> 4674.34]  hmm
[4674.34 --> 4675.72]  you could just get
[4675.72 --> 4676.44]  tattoo removal
[4676.44 --> 4677.38]  or would there have to
[4677.38 --> 4677.86]  be a thing where I
[4677.86 --> 4678.44]  have to keep it
[4678.44 --> 4678.94]  yeah you probably
[4678.94 --> 4679.62]  have to wear it
[4679.62 --> 4680.10]  for let's say
[4680.10 --> 4680.68]  five years
[4680.68 --> 4683.62]  million bucks
[4683.62 --> 4685.12]  five years
[4685.12 --> 4686.12]  maybe to be honest
[4686.12 --> 4686.74]  because it's one of
[4686.74 --> 4687.36]  those things that's
[4687.36 --> 4687.88]  ridiculous
[4687.88 --> 4688.74]  I could just hide
[4688.74 --> 4689.26]  in my room
[4689.26 --> 4690.24]  and play video games
[4690.24 --> 4691.22]  on the best computer
[4691.22 --> 4691.66]  ever
[4691.66 --> 4692.44]  just be like
[4692.44 --> 4692.82]  yeah
[4692.82 --> 4694.74]  I don't even care
[4694.74 --> 4696.48]  and then just come
[4696.48 --> 4697.00]  out with like
[4697.00 --> 4697.74]  a nice car
[4697.74 --> 4698.80]  and a nice house
[4698.80 --> 4699.66]  already paid off
[4699.66 --> 4700.64]  and just get the
[4700.64 --> 4701.26]  thing taken off
[4701.26 --> 4701.74]  my face
[4701.74 --> 4702.74]  what if they made
[4702.74 --> 4703.26]  you embed the
[4703.26 --> 4703.88]  horns too
[4703.88 --> 4705.54]  oh
[4705.54 --> 4706.66]  you can do that
[4706.66 --> 4706.96]  too
[4706.96 --> 4707.14]  I know
[4707.14 --> 4707.84]  that's a thing
[4707.84 --> 4708.22]  I know
[4708.22 --> 4708.92]  it's like actually
[4708.92 --> 4709.34]  a thing
[4709.34 --> 4709.86]  oh I know
[4709.86 --> 4713.82]  he's thinking
[4713.82 --> 4714.40]  so guys
[4714.40 --> 4715.06]  no I probably
[4715.06 --> 4715.34]  would
[4715.34 --> 4715.90]  let's get this
[4715.90 --> 4716.76]  kickstarter going
[4716.76 --> 4717.92]  I probably would
[4717.92 --> 4718.90]  and I would just
[4718.90 --> 4721.00]  cosplay 100%
[4721.00 --> 4721.50]  of the time
[4721.50 --> 4722.42]  I'm just like
[4722.42 --> 4723.80]  nope screw it
[4723.80 --> 4724.30]  I'm just
[4724.30 --> 4725.06]  I'm Darth Maul
[4725.06 --> 4725.76]  for five years
[4725.76 --> 4727.60]  move to Las Vegas
[4727.60 --> 4729.06]  and then just hang
[4729.06 --> 4730.12]  out on the sidewalk
[4730.12 --> 4732.00]  and augment your
[4732.00 --> 4732.72]  income with like
[4732.72 --> 4733.24]  a tip jar
[4733.24 --> 4734.28]  and like photo ops
[4734.28 --> 4734.58]  yeah
[4734.58 --> 4736.08]  so everyone can
[4736.08 --> 4736.70]  think I'm like
[4736.70 --> 4737.38]  actually trying to
[4737.38 --> 4737.78]  make money
[4737.78 --> 4738.46]  and being legit
[4738.46 --> 4738.90]  about this
[4738.90 --> 4739.56]  but realistically
[4739.56 --> 4740.28]  I just got paid
[4740.28 --> 4740.48]  off
[4740.48 --> 4740.94]  realistically
[4740.94 --> 4741.42]  you're even
[4741.42 --> 4742.04]  more legit
[4742.04 --> 4742.74]  than they know
[4742.74 --> 4744.38]  Samuel
[4744.38 --> 4745.00]  that's not the
[4745.00 --> 4745.92]  case at all
[4745.92 --> 4746.98]  at all
[4746.98 --> 4748.10]  it was definitely
[4748.10 --> 4749.22]  not the back burner
[4749.22 --> 4750.00]  a lot of what I
[4750.00 --> 4750.74]  did at NCIX
[4750.74 --> 4751.52]  wasn't really
[4751.52 --> 4752.70]  visible to customers
[4752.70 --> 4755.08]  well not in a way
[4755.08 --> 4755.74]  that had your name
[4755.74 --> 4756.30]  attached to it
[4756.30 --> 4757.10]  yeah I mean I was
[4757.10 --> 4758.06]  working on pricing
[4758.06 --> 4758.90]  or you know
[4758.90 --> 4760.14]  strategic whatever
[4760.14 --> 4760.64]  the heck
[4760.64 --> 4761.44]  marketing
[4761.44 --> 4763.70]  my baby's name
[4763.70 --> 4764.52]  is not going to
[4764.52 --> 4765.16]  be something that
[4765.16 --> 4765.96]  I'm talking about
[4765.96 --> 4767.90]  Andrew asks
[4767.90 --> 4768.98]  if you get approached
[4768.98 --> 4769.86]  by revision 3
[4769.86 --> 4770.32]  or something
[4770.32 --> 4771.04]  will you let them
[4771.04 --> 4771.48]  eat you
[4771.48 --> 4772.60]  so that's an
[4772.60 --> 4773.28]  interesting question
[4773.28 --> 4774.00]  I have talked
[4774.00 --> 4774.78]  to revision 3
[4774.78 --> 4775.98]  I've talked to
[4775.98 --> 4777.68]  maker studios
[4777.68 --> 4779.14]  I've talked to
[4779.14 --> 4782.14]  one other guy
[4782.14 --> 4783.24]  that's not really
[4783.24 --> 4783.90]  in the youtube
[4783.90 --> 4785.40]  network business
[4785.40 --> 4786.00]  yet but they
[4786.00 --> 4786.62]  might be soon
[4786.62 --> 4787.34]  but they're legit
[4787.34 --> 4788.14]  they're cool guys
[4788.14 --> 4790.96]  so I guess it
[4790.96 --> 4791.54]  just is a matter
[4791.54 --> 4792.08]  of what you mean
[4792.08 --> 4792.64]  by eat you
[4792.64 --> 4793.82]  because revision 3
[4793.82 --> 4794.52]  for example
[4794.52 --> 4796.62]  they don't eat you
[4796.62 --> 4797.18]  they don't dictate
[4797.18 --> 4797.84]  what your content
[4797.84 --> 4798.28]  is going to be
[4798.28 --> 4799.22]  they're not like
[4799.22 --> 4800.02]  oh we don't like
[4800.02 --> 4800.62]  Linus Tech Tips
[4800.62 --> 4801.24]  the way it is
[4801.24 --> 4802.04]  you need to
[4802.04 --> 4803.88]  have monkeys
[4803.88 --> 4805.40]  so what are my
[4805.40 --> 4805.98]  favorite shows
[4805.98 --> 4806.72]  on revision 3
[4806.72 --> 4808.50]  I mean I think
[4808.50 --> 4809.18]  looking at someone
[4809.18 --> 4809.98]  like my fellow
[4809.98 --> 4810.72]  Canadian Lou
[4810.72 --> 4811.70]  from Unbox Therapy
[4811.70 --> 4812.30]  I did a collab
[4812.30 --> 4813.00]  with him not that
[4813.00 --> 4813.48]  long ago
[4813.48 --> 4815.16]  I don't think
[4815.16 --> 4815.92]  that joining
[4815.92 --> 4816.48]  revision 3
[4816.48 --> 4817.06]  has changed his
[4817.06 --> 4818.32]  content mostly
[4818.32 --> 4819.74]  I think his CES
[4819.74 --> 4820.86]  content with that
[4820.86 --> 4821.66]  Ford integration
[4821.66 --> 4823.74]  was a little bit
[4823.74 --> 4824.92]  Fordy
[4824.92 --> 4827.20]  and I mean
[4827.20 --> 4828.10]  I liked the way
[4828.10 --> 4828.96]  that we were able
[4828.96 --> 4830.04]  to do CES
[4830.04 --> 4830.98]  as an independent
[4830.98 --> 4832.40]  where we basically
[4832.40 --> 4833.38]  found sponsors
[4833.38 --> 4834.20]  that we know
[4834.20 --> 4834.78]  and like
[4834.78 --> 4835.94]  so we went with
[4835.94 --> 4836.46]  Corsair
[4836.46 --> 4838.18]  because we love
[4838.18 --> 4838.70]  Corsair
[4838.70 --> 4839.60]  and the stuff
[4839.60 --> 4840.12]  that they do
[4840.12 --> 4840.78]  we went with
[4840.78 --> 4841.30]  Seagate
[4841.30 --> 4841.96]  because
[4841.96 --> 4843.20]  okay so get
[4843.20 --> 4844.06]  I mean the messaging
[4844.06 --> 4845.10]  was Seagate
[4845.10 --> 4846.28]  trusted storage partner
[4846.28 --> 4848.28]  all of our
[4848.28 --> 4849.96]  archived footage
[4849.96 --> 4850.92]  goes on Seagate
[4850.92 --> 4851.30]  drives
[4851.30 --> 4852.58]  on a big fat
[4852.58 --> 4853.28]  RAID controller
[4853.28 --> 4854.44]  in a server
[4854.44 --> 4855.74]  so it's one of
[4855.74 --> 4856.10]  those things
[4856.10 --> 4857.12]  where we're
[4857.12 --> 4857.92]  saying something
[4857.92 --> 4858.82]  we're partnering
[4858.82 --> 4859.64]  with a sponsor
[4859.64 --> 4860.90]  but we're already
[4860.90 --> 4863.38]  utilizing or backing
[4863.38 --> 4864.26]  them in some way
[4864.26 --> 4864.76]  so we're not
[4864.76 --> 4865.46]  worried about that
[4865.46 --> 4865.96]  we're legit
[4865.96 --> 4867.02]  using those drives
[4867.02 --> 4868.10]  and if they all
[4868.10 --> 4868.84]  failed on us
[4868.84 --> 4869.52]  we might be having
[4869.52 --> 4870.52]  a different conversation
[4870.52 --> 4871.20]  about who our
[4871.20 --> 4872.38]  trusted storage partner
[4872.38 --> 4872.70]  is
[4872.70 --> 4873.64]  I mean for that
[4873.64 --> 4874.36]  that said
[4874.36 --> 4875.10]  I'd be comfortable
[4875.10 --> 4876.34]  calling WD a trusted
[4876.34 --> 4877.24]  storage partner too
[4877.24 --> 4878.08]  because I
[4878.08 --> 4879.48]  we also use
[4879.48 --> 4880.80]  WD drives
[4880.80 --> 4881.56]  just not for that
[4881.56 --> 4882.60]  specific purpose
[4882.60 --> 4883.48]  we have
[4883.48 --> 4884.82]  no we have WD drives
[4884.82 --> 4885.82]  in the
[4885.82 --> 4886.80]  iSCSI
[4886.80 --> 4888.20]  I have a Seagate
[4888.20 --> 4889.22]  and a WD drive
[4889.22 --> 4889.82]  in my system
[4889.82 --> 4890.36]  so basically
[4890.36 --> 4890.94]  they're trusted
[4890.94 --> 4891.66]  storage partners
[4891.66 --> 4892.84]  so we don't have
[4892.84 --> 4893.70]  to do a minute
[4893.70 --> 4894.38]  and a half long
[4894.38 --> 4894.80]  commercial
[4894.80 --> 4896.30]  for Seagate
[4896.30 --> 4897.04]  at the end of
[4897.04 --> 4897.90]  you know a video
[4897.90 --> 4898.50]  we just have to
[4898.50 --> 4898.82]  kind of say
[4898.82 --> 4899.22]  look they're our
[4899.22 --> 4899.86]  trusted storage partner
[4899.86 --> 4900.90]  and Linksys same thing
[4900.90 --> 4902.84]  Linksys I think
[4902.84 --> 4903.82]  probably 90%
[4903.82 --> 4904.42]  of the networking
[4904.42 --> 4905.28]  gear in this house
[4905.28 --> 4905.90]  is Linksys
[4905.90 --> 4906.92]  and non-conflicting
[4906.92 --> 4908.40]  and non-conflicting
[4908.40 --> 4909.10]  the triangle
[4909.10 --> 4910.00]  of non-conflicting
[4910.00 --> 4910.44]  brands
[4910.44 --> 4911.20]  yeah so it's not
[4911.20 --> 4912.12]  like we're gonna say
[4912.12 --> 4912.60]  you know
[4912.60 --> 4913.58]  sponsored by Intel
[4913.58 --> 4914.58]  sponsored by AMD
[4914.58 --> 4915.76]  both of which are
[4915.76 --> 4916.82]  you know the best CPU
[4916.82 --> 4917.60]  and you should buy it
[4917.60 --> 4918.10]  because
[4918.10 --> 4919.66]  I mean we're trying
[4919.66 --> 4920.28]  we're trying to pick
[4920.28 --> 4920.84]  and choose things
[4920.84 --> 4922.10]  I mean honestly
[4922.10 --> 4922.86]  when you're starting
[4922.86 --> 4923.28]  a business
[4923.28 --> 4924.52]  you can't necessarily
[4924.52 --> 4925.06]  just say
[4925.06 --> 4926.54]  no I turned my nose
[4926.54 --> 4927.36]  up to you
[4927.36 --> 4928.22]  you know you cannot
[4928.22 --> 4929.28]  sponsor our trip to CES
[4929.28 --> 4929.94]  because we wanted to
[4929.94 --> 4930.46]  go down there
[4930.46 --> 4930.94]  and we wanted to
[4930.94 --> 4931.60]  make that content
[4931.60 --> 4932.76]  so we had to find
[4932.76 --> 4933.38]  a way to do it
[4933.38 --> 4934.50]  but we were lucky
[4934.50 --> 4935.44]  enough to find partners
[4935.44 --> 4936.04]  that we were really
[4936.04 --> 4937.00]  comfortable working with
[4937.00 --> 4938.88]  so revision 3
[4938.88 --> 4940.60]  would allow us
[4940.60 --> 4941.44]  to opt out
[4941.44 --> 4942.06]  of something like
[4942.06 --> 4942.84]  a Ford integration
[4942.84 --> 4943.40]  if we weren't
[4943.40 --> 4944.24]  comfortable with
[4944.24 --> 4945.04]  Ford cars
[4945.04 --> 4945.88]  or whatever else
[4945.88 --> 4947.14]  they don't dictate
[4947.14 --> 4947.66]  your content
[4947.66 --> 4948.92]  they want a watermark
[4948.92 --> 4950.10]  at some point
[4950.10 --> 4951.00]  we will likely partner
[4951.00 --> 4951.60]  with a network
[4951.60 --> 4953.54]  but I don't know
[4953.54 --> 4954.12]  I mean it's
[4954.12 --> 4954.78]  it's something that
[4954.78 --> 4955.54]  I've actually been
[4955.54 --> 4956.58]  working on for more
[4956.58 --> 4957.68]  than six months now
[4957.68 --> 4958.60]  we don't want to
[4958.60 --> 4959.58]  make a bad decision
[4959.58 --> 4960.00]  we don't want
[4960.00 --> 4960.44]  something that will
[4960.44 --> 4961.32]  impact you guys
[4961.32 --> 4962.12]  we don't want
[4962.12 --> 4962.62]  something that's
[4962.62 --> 4963.30]  going to influence
[4963.30 --> 4964.00]  us
[4964.00 --> 4966.66]  yeah exactly
[4966.66 --> 4967.62]  we want it to
[4967.62 --> 4968.18]  stay true
[4968.18 --> 4969.16]  to how it has been
[4969.16 --> 4970.60]  like we said earlier
[4970.60 --> 4971.46]  with the tech
[4971.46 --> 4972.04]  quickie movement
[4972.04 --> 4972.56]  and starting the
[4972.56 --> 4972.94]  company and all
[4972.94 --> 4973.38]  that kind of stuff
[4973.38 --> 4974.66]  like we're changing
[4974.66 --> 4975.30]  things with tech
[4975.30 --> 4975.66]  quickie
[4975.66 --> 4976.46]  we're not changing
[4976.46 --> 4977.24]  anything with
[4977.24 --> 4978.06]  either of the channels
[4978.06 --> 4978.64]  that are already
[4978.64 --> 4979.42]  running because we
[4979.42 --> 4980.34]  know you guys like it
[4980.34 --> 4981.50]  and we hope you
[4981.50 --> 4982.02]  guys like it
[4982.02 --> 4982.82]  we hope you guys
[4982.82 --> 4983.22]  like it
[4983.22 --> 4984.44]  so yeah
[4984.44 --> 4985.30]  if you hate it
[4985.30 --> 4985.74]  we're sorry
[4985.74 --> 4986.70]  I think people
[4986.70 --> 4987.32]  are tuning out
[4987.32 --> 4987.76]  they're bored
[4987.76 --> 4988.84]  no I think they
[4988.84 --> 4989.24]  just hate the
[4989.24 --> 4989.76]  choppy video
[4989.76 --> 4990.34]  actually I don't
[4990.34 --> 4990.56]  know
[4990.56 --> 4991.54]  so let's go back
[4991.54 --> 4992.14]  to Twitter for a
[4992.14 --> 4992.42]  little bit
[4992.42 --> 4992.98]  and then we'll do
[4992.98 --> 4993.62]  our Windows 8
[4993.62 --> 4993.98]  giveaway
[4993.98 --> 4996.56]  Linus says
[4996.56 --> 4997.42]  again funny
[4997.42 --> 4998.80]  good luck
[4998.80 --> 4999.30]  shout out to
[4999.30 --> 4999.92]  PewDiePie
[4999.92 --> 5000.52]  oh man
[5000.52 --> 5002.26]  brave move
[5002.26 --> 5002.96]  thank you
[5002.96 --> 5004.74]  no not a new
[5004.74 --> 5005.44]  baby again
[5005.44 --> 5006.32]  my baby is
[5006.32 --> 5007.76]  nine months old
[5007.76 --> 5009.38]  huh
[5009.38 --> 5009.72]  okay
[5009.72 --> 5010.52]  good question
[5010.52 --> 5011.48]  Linus
[5011.48 --> 5012.56]  does SlickPC
[5012.56 --> 5013.42]  have an important
[5013.42 --> 5014.08]  position in the
[5014.08 --> 5014.32]  company
[5014.32 --> 5014.88]  what is your
[5014.88 --> 5015.48]  position in the
[5015.48 --> 5015.80]  company
[5015.80 --> 5017.46]  my uh
[5017.46 --> 5019.50]  I do all the
[5019.50 --> 5019.94]  things
[5019.94 --> 5022.16]  I don't really
[5022.16 --> 5023.70]  know how to
[5023.70 --> 5024.50]  even say that
[5024.50 --> 5025.32]  my title
[5025.32 --> 5026.60]  my official title
[5026.60 --> 5027.80]  is IT lead
[5027.80 --> 5028.90]  I don't even
[5028.90 --> 5029.62]  think that matters
[5029.62 --> 5030.24]  at this point
[5030.24 --> 5031.18]  um
[5031.18 --> 5032.52]  I don't know
[5032.52 --> 5033.18]  right now
[5033.18 --> 5034.32]  we're three guys
[5034.32 --> 5034.90]  trying to do
[5034.90 --> 5035.30]  everything
[5035.30 --> 5036.26]  so we all
[5036.26 --> 5037.00]  just kind of
[5037.00 --> 5038.00]  do everything
[5038.00 --> 5039.40]  um
[5039.40 --> 5041.02]  positions aren't
[5041.02 --> 5042.52]  really in stone
[5042.52 --> 5043.18]  at the moment
[5043.18 --> 5044.90]  I prep videos
[5044.90 --> 5045.52]  I benchmark
[5045.52 --> 5046.24]  things
[5046.24 --> 5046.96]  I film
[5046.96 --> 5048.76]  I storyboard
[5048.76 --> 5049.20]  stuff
[5049.20 --> 5051.00]  I try and
[5051.00 --> 5051.56]  help orchestrate
[5051.56 --> 5052.00]  shots
[5052.00 --> 5052.72]  I give
[5052.72 --> 5054.74]  feedback on
[5054.74 --> 5055.46]  Diesel's editing
[5055.46 --> 5057.34]  I edit
[5057.34 --> 5058.12]  sometimes
[5058.12 --> 5058.74]  I like
[5058.74 --> 5059.44]  not very well
[5059.44 --> 5060.62]  not that well
[5060.62 --> 5062.10]  but like
[5062.10 --> 5062.76]  I don't know
[5062.76 --> 5063.46]  we all kind of
[5063.46 --> 5064.00]  do everything
[5064.00 --> 5064.96]  so yeah
[5064.96 --> 5066.40]  okay so
[5066.40 --> 5067.18]  let's do
[5067.18 --> 5067.58]  uh
[5067.58 --> 5068.04]  let's do our
[5068.04 --> 5068.84]  windows 8 giveaway
[5068.84 --> 5069.54]  do you have a question
[5069.54 --> 5070.12]  no
[5070.12 --> 5071.58]  do you have a question
[5071.58 --> 5073.78]  okay you go do a question
[5073.78 --> 5074.32]  while I
[5074.32 --> 5075.40]  while I come up with
[5075.40 --> 5075.84]  a topic
[5075.84 --> 5076.44]  well not come up with
[5076.44 --> 5076.70]  a topic
[5076.70 --> 5077.30]  I have a topic
[5077.30 --> 5079.62]  so all along the lines
[5079.62 --> 5081.40]  of monetizing content
[5081.40 --> 5082.50]  and
[5082.50 --> 5083.34]  you know
[5083.34 --> 5084.32]  will someone
[5084.32 --> 5085.88]  buy out your content
[5085.88 --> 5086.76]  and eat you
[5086.76 --> 5087.80]  and all that good stuff
[5087.80 --> 5088.76]  YouTube
[5088.76 --> 5090.24]  has
[5090.24 --> 5091.80]  paywalls
[5091.80 --> 5092.08]  coming
[5092.08 --> 5093.08]  so
[5093.08 --> 5094.12]  this was
[5094.12 --> 5094.46]  this was
[5094.46 --> 5094.70]  oh
[5094.70 --> 5095.46]  can you open up
[5095.46 --> 5096.04]  that page again
[5096.04 --> 5096.84]  where did I see
[5096.84 --> 5097.42]  this article
[5097.42 --> 5099.34]  real seo
[5099.34 --> 5101.10]  r-e-e-l-seo
[5101.10 --> 5102.32]  YouTube will have
[5102.32 --> 5103.18]  paid subscription
[5103.18 --> 5104.26]  channels soon
[5104.26 --> 5105.18]  so this will be
[5105.18 --> 5105.72]  starting
[5105.72 --> 5106.48]  they're sending out
[5106.48 --> 5107.32]  offers apparently
[5107.32 --> 5107.98]  this is all
[5107.98 --> 5108.90]  sort of supposedly
[5108.90 --> 5110.28]  sending out offers
[5110.28 --> 5111.00]  to some
[5111.00 --> 5112.86]  premium content
[5112.86 --> 5113.48]  creators
[5113.48 --> 5114.36]  because part of
[5114.36 --> 5114.74]  the whole
[5114.74 --> 5116.04]  okay and this
[5116.04 --> 5116.30]  this
[5116.30 --> 5117.20]  okay hold on
[5117.20 --> 5117.94]  no I'll launch into this
[5117.94 --> 5118.12]  later
[5118.12 --> 5119.22]  so they're sending out
[5119.22 --> 5120.18]  invitations to some
[5120.18 --> 5120.92]  content creators
[5120.92 --> 5121.38]  to
[5121.38 --> 5123.36]  have premium channels
[5123.36 --> 5124.08]  that will be anywhere
[5124.08 --> 5125.74]  from a dollar to five dollars
[5125.74 --> 5126.88]  a month to subscribe to
[5126.88 --> 5127.54]  which you could kind of
[5127.54 --> 5128.10]  look at and go
[5128.10 --> 5129.06]  okay well if it's someone
[5129.06 --> 5129.68]  that's creating
[5129.68 --> 5131.34]  fantastic content
[5131.34 --> 5132.60]  and you know
[5132.60 --> 5133.40]  I really really really
[5133.40 --> 5134.10]  like it
[5134.10 --> 5134.88]  and
[5134.88 --> 5136.98]  you know
[5136.98 --> 5138.20]  beats watching
[5138.20 --> 5139.90]  reruns of friends
[5139.90 --> 5141.54]  on Friday night
[5141.54 --> 5142.26]  or whatever
[5142.26 --> 5143.36]  whenever reruns of friends
[5143.36 --> 5143.62]  are on
[5143.62 --> 5145.70]  so I could kind of
[5145.70 --> 5147.10]  see people doing it
[5147.10 --> 5150.34]  but it goes against
[5150.34 --> 5151.84]  for me
[5151.84 --> 5152.98]  the philosophy
[5152.98 --> 5153.96]  of internet video
[5153.96 --> 5154.80]  compared to what
[5154.80 --> 5155.60]  we've done in the past
[5155.60 --> 5156.52]  I mean I understand
[5156.52 --> 5157.36]  YouTube's
[5157.36 --> 5159.32]  inherent need
[5159.32 --> 5161.56]  to monetize
[5161.56 --> 5162.22]  the content
[5162.22 --> 5163.22]  in such a way
[5163.22 --> 5163.82]  that it can be
[5163.82 --> 5164.54]  self-sustaining
[5164.54 --> 5165.54]  I don't know that
[5165.54 --> 5166.60]  YouTube's ever made
[5166.60 --> 5167.04]  any money
[5167.04 --> 5168.50]  I really don't think
[5168.50 --> 5168.80]  so
[5168.80 --> 5170.62]  the amount of
[5170.62 --> 5171.82]  bandwidth required
[5171.82 --> 5172.80]  for what they're doing
[5172.80 --> 5173.58]  is
[5173.58 --> 5174.98]  just
[5174.98 --> 5175.72]  ridiculous
[5175.72 --> 5176.36]  the amount of
[5176.36 --> 5177.18]  admin and overhead
[5177.18 --> 5177.80]  that goes into
[5177.80 --> 5178.38]  what they're doing
[5178.38 --> 5179.08]  is ridiculous
[5179.08 --> 5180.46]  and
[5180.46 --> 5181.78]  they're
[5181.78 --> 5183.48]  yeah
[5183.48 --> 5184.44]  so they need ways
[5184.44 --> 5184.86]  to make money
[5184.86 --> 5185.58]  I mean they end up
[5185.58 --> 5186.10]  in sort of the
[5186.10 --> 5186.46]  Facebook
[5186.46 --> 5188.26]  sort of quandary
[5188.26 --> 5188.90]  where Facebook
[5188.90 --> 5189.46]  is like
[5189.46 --> 5190.38]  yeah we have this
[5190.38 --> 5191.46]  huge user base
[5191.46 --> 5191.80]  but
[5191.80 --> 5192.88]  like how do we
[5192.88 --> 5193.48]  turn that into
[5193.48 --> 5194.00]  something that
[5194.00 --> 5194.52]  stockholders
[5194.52 --> 5195.48]  will appreciate
[5195.48 --> 5196.02]  hard to say
[5196.02 --> 5196.66]  so
[5196.66 --> 5198.48]  I would love to hear
[5198.48 --> 5199.86]  what you guys think
[5199.86 --> 5203.16]  of paid subscriptions
[5203.16 --> 5203.66]  to YouTube
[5203.66 --> 5204.48]  so to be clear
[5204.48 --> 5205.78]  I mean I'd say
[5205.78 --> 5207.00]  never with an asterisk
[5207.00 --> 5207.74]  here but
[5207.74 --> 5208.72]  I will never
[5208.72 --> 5209.84]  have a paid channel
[5209.84 --> 5210.92]  it's not really
[5210.92 --> 5211.52]  what we're trying
[5211.52 --> 5212.34]  to do at all
[5212.34 --> 5213.24]  I mean we want
[5213.24 --> 5214.32]  viewers to just
[5214.32 --> 5214.90]  come and watch
[5214.90 --> 5215.36]  the videos
[5215.36 --> 5216.34]  we love that
[5216.34 --> 5218.86]  but I'd love to
[5218.86 --> 5219.68]  hear your thoughts
[5219.68 --> 5220.78]  on paid
[5220.78 --> 5222.26]  YouTube channels
[5222.26 --> 5227.30]  will it just
[5227.30 --> 5228.28]  kill internet video
[5228.28 --> 5229.30]  would you rather
[5229.30 --> 5229.76]  just
[5229.76 --> 5231.14]  I think it's
[5231.14 --> 5231.82]  going to be more
[5231.82 --> 5233.04]  of like TV show
[5233.04 --> 5233.34]  format
[5233.34 --> 5234.94]  right
[5234.94 --> 5235.58]  well yeah
[5235.58 --> 5236.06]  I mean I'm
[5236.06 --> 5236.68]  expecting that to
[5236.68 --> 5237.14]  happen but
[5237.14 --> 5238.40]  people ran away
[5238.40 --> 5239.40]  from TV shows
[5239.40 --> 5240.08]  to watch videos
[5240.08 --> 5240.60]  on the internet
[5240.60 --> 5241.92]  yeah
[5241.92 --> 5242.50]  I don't think
[5242.50 --> 5242.86]  it's going to be
[5242.86 --> 5243.28]  successful
[5243.28 --> 5244.04]  I just think
[5244.04 --> 5244.64]  the only people
[5244.64 --> 5244.94]  that are going to
[5244.94 --> 5245.46]  do it are like
[5245.46 --> 5246.28]  TV show format
[5246.28 --> 5247.40]  I don't think
[5247.40 --> 5248.00]  it's going to be
[5248.00 --> 5249.88]  a very lucrative
[5249.88 --> 5250.48]  move at all
[5250.48 --> 5251.46]  on the other hand
[5251.46 --> 5252.82]  I went to an
[5252.82 --> 5253.60]  interesting conference
[5253.60 --> 5254.48]  where they said
[5254.48 --> 5255.36]  it's something like
[5255.36 --> 5256.28]  seven years
[5256.28 --> 5257.88]  between your first
[5257.88 --> 5259.28]  between a free user
[5259.28 --> 5260.16]  and converting
[5260.16 --> 5260.64]  that person
[5260.64 --> 5261.40]  to a paid user
[5261.40 --> 5263.68]  so if it succeeds
[5263.68 --> 5264.28]  we won't know
[5264.28 --> 5264.62]  immediately
[5264.62 --> 5265.14]  this was
[5265.14 --> 5266.58]  the guy who
[5266.58 --> 5267.46]  started you send it
[5267.46 --> 5269.70]  so he was saying
[5269.70 --> 5271.68]  when they turned on
[5271.68 --> 5272.50]  the paid service
[5272.50 --> 5273.22]  because it was free
[5273.22 --> 5274.00]  for the longest time
[5274.00 --> 5274.44]  at first
[5274.44 --> 5276.16]  someone signed up
[5276.16 --> 5276.96]  almost immediately
[5276.96 --> 5277.80]  but what they found
[5277.80 --> 5278.98]  now with more data
[5278.98 --> 5280.12]  is that between
[5280.12 --> 5280.92]  the first sign up
[5280.92 --> 5281.46]  and when someone
[5281.46 --> 5282.02]  actually goes
[5282.02 --> 5283.02]  I enjoy this service
[5283.02 --> 5283.52]  so much
[5283.52 --> 5284.08]  that I don't mind
[5284.08 --> 5284.86]  paying a couple bucks
[5284.86 --> 5285.22]  for it
[5285.22 --> 5285.92]  to get a couple more
[5285.92 --> 5286.20]  features
[5286.20 --> 5286.52]  this is about
[5286.52 --> 5287.30]  seven years
[5287.30 --> 5289.22]  which is a huge
[5289.22 --> 5289.86]  amount of time
[5289.86 --> 5290.52]  I mean YouTube
[5290.52 --> 5293.20]  will be so different
[5293.20 --> 5294.30]  seven years from now
[5294.30 --> 5295.24]  look how fast
[5295.24 --> 5295.74]  it's changing
[5295.74 --> 5296.44]  all the time
[5296.44 --> 5296.94]  yeah Reddit's
[5296.94 --> 5297.46]  having a problem
[5297.46 --> 5297.82]  with that
[5297.82 --> 5299.32]  they can't necessarily
[5299.32 --> 5300.16]  get people to sign up
[5300.16 --> 5300.76]  for Reddit Gold
[5300.76 --> 5301.96]  because people
[5301.96 --> 5302.62]  don't see the value
[5302.62 --> 5303.06]  in it
[5303.06 --> 5303.38]  yeah
[5303.38 --> 5305.04]  it's taking a really
[5305.04 --> 5305.54]  long time
[5305.54 --> 5306.10]  for them to
[5306.10 --> 5307.26]  get people to move over
[5307.26 --> 5308.14]  and even
[5308.14 --> 5309.48]  hardcore people
[5309.48 --> 5309.94]  are just going
[5309.94 --> 5310.64]  like I don't see
[5310.64 --> 5311.70]  a positive in this
[5311.70 --> 5313.82]  so if YouTube
[5313.82 --> 5314.70]  can figure out
[5314.70 --> 5315.42]  a way to attract
[5315.42 --> 5316.24]  content creators
[5316.24 --> 5317.00]  that will attract
[5317.00 --> 5317.76]  paid subscriptions
[5317.76 --> 5319.40]  you know
[5319.40 --> 5320.14]  good luck to them
[5320.14 --> 5321.20]  and as John here
[5321.20 --> 5321.94]  says please stay
[5321.94 --> 5322.32]  unpaid
[5322.32 --> 5322.84]  don't worry
[5322.84 --> 5323.14]  we're going to
[5323.14 --> 5323.74]  be unpaid
[5323.74 --> 5325.34]  I don't think
[5325.34 --> 5326.50]  that suits our style
[5326.50 --> 5327.18]  it's not really
[5327.18 --> 5327.68]  our style
[5327.68 --> 5328.34]  I don't think
[5328.34 --> 5329.28]  that people watch
[5329.28 --> 5330.08]  Linus Tech Tips
[5330.08 --> 5330.80]  for the sheer
[5330.80 --> 5331.92]  entertainment value
[5331.92 --> 5332.24]  of it
[5332.24 --> 5332.90]  I think it's more
[5332.90 --> 5333.78]  like that's a
[5333.78 --> 5334.32]  cool product
[5334.32 --> 5335.12]  or maybe it's
[5335.12 --> 5335.50]  a little bit
[5335.50 --> 5335.96]  entertaining
[5335.96 --> 5336.72]  or whatever else
[5336.72 --> 5337.08]  I mean we're
[5337.08 --> 5337.74]  here to more
[5337.74 --> 5338.12]  like
[5338.12 --> 5338.92]  the next video
[5338.92 --> 5340.00]  has some serious
[5340.00 --> 5340.76]  entertainment value
[5340.76 --> 5341.94]  yeah I've watched
[5341.94 --> 5342.88]  it at least
[5342.88 --> 5343.84]  30 times already
[5343.84 --> 5344.70]  probably around there
[5344.70 --> 5346.00]  like seriously
[5346.00 --> 5346.72]  this is by
[5346.72 --> 5347.84]  I like fell asleep
[5347.84 --> 5348.70]  watching it last night
[5348.70 --> 5349.16]  I'm going to bring
[5349.16 --> 5349.88]  out that by far
[5349.88 --> 5350.44]  and large again
[5350.44 --> 5351.96]  but this is
[5351.96 --> 5352.74]  seriously by far
[5352.74 --> 5353.02]  and large
[5353.02 --> 5353.86]  the best video
[5353.86 --> 5354.68]  we've made
[5354.68 --> 5355.00]  oh yeah
[5355.00 --> 5355.78]  by a long shot
[5355.78 --> 5356.60]  and it's not done yet
[5356.60 --> 5357.96]  like everything else
[5357.96 --> 5358.52]  we've ever done
[5358.52 --> 5359.58]  is just not good
[5359.58 --> 5361.06]  just low
[5361.06 --> 5361.70]  you can't really
[5361.70 --> 5362.48]  compare to this
[5362.48 --> 5363.50]  you can't see how low
[5363.50 --> 5363.82]  it is
[5363.82 --> 5364.36]  below this line
[5364.36 --> 5365.00]  down here
[5365.00 --> 5365.20]  yeah
[5365.20 --> 5366.24]  there we go
[5366.24 --> 5368.00]  SteelSeries vinyl wrap
[5368.00 --> 5368.62]  on a table
[5368.62 --> 5369.62]  is coming soon
[5369.62 --> 5370.50]  I hope to have
[5370.50 --> 5371.00]  something to show
[5371.00 --> 5371.34]  you guys
[5371.34 --> 5371.80]  in the next
[5371.80 --> 5372.40]  couple weeks
[5372.40 --> 5375.70]  what now
[5375.70 --> 5376.44]  oh yeah yeah yeah
[5376.44 --> 5376.86]  got it
[5376.86 --> 5377.54]  but don't worry
[5377.54 --> 5378.40]  we'll go that
[5378.40 --> 5380.90]  does Slick
[5380.90 --> 5381.46]  change his hair
[5381.46 --> 5381.90]  every day
[5381.90 --> 5382.28]  no
[5382.28 --> 5383.44]  that's just what
[5383.44 --> 5383.84]  it looks like
[5383.84 --> 5384.26]  when he crawls
[5384.26 --> 5384.68]  out of bed
[5384.68 --> 5387.94]  how do you know
[5387.94 --> 5388.48]  when to change
[5388.48 --> 5389.52]  liquid in a loop
[5389.52 --> 5390.28]  black tubes
[5390.28 --> 5390.96]  yeah probably
[5390.96 --> 5392.92]  does the AIO's
[5392.92 --> 5393.54]  coolers last
[5393.54 --> 5394.16]  until the pump
[5394.16 --> 5394.36]  dies
[5394.36 --> 5394.80]  I think they're
[5394.80 --> 5395.30]  supposed to
[5395.30 --> 5395.64]  I think they're
[5395.64 --> 5396.14]  rated for about
[5396.14 --> 5396.76]  five years
[5396.76 --> 5398.16]  of course
[5398.16 --> 5398.60]  don't partner
[5398.60 --> 5399.30]  with Channel Pro
[5399.30 --> 5400.22]  wasn't intending
[5400.22 --> 5400.96]  to
[5400.96 --> 5403.32]  who is the
[5403.32 --> 5404.02]  third man in the
[5404.02 --> 5404.46]  business
[5404.46 --> 5404.98]  Diesel
[5404.98 --> 5406.34]  have you tried
[5406.34 --> 5407.20]  the H10 yet
[5407.20 --> 5408.22]  the H10
[5408.22 --> 5408.68]  H1
[5408.68 --> 5409.22]  or H10
[5409.22 --> 5409.80]  the H110
[5409.80 --> 5410.50]  is installed
[5410.50 --> 5411.30]  in our thermal
[5411.30 --> 5411.74]  test bench
[5411.74 --> 5412.34]  right now
[5412.34 --> 5412.84]  but we haven't
[5412.84 --> 5413.54]  run numbers yet
[5413.54 --> 5414.66]  rather Slick
[5414.66 --> 5415.38]  hasn't run numbers
[5415.38 --> 5415.64]  yet
[5415.64 --> 5417.76]  what
[5417.76 --> 5418.68]  gives me another
[5418.68 --> 5419.14]  job
[5419.14 --> 5419.92]  and then complains
[5419.92 --> 5420.36]  that I didn't
[5420.36 --> 5421.30]  complete the first one
[5421.30 --> 5425.80]  yeah that's not
[5425.80 --> 5426.28]  going to happen
[5426.28 --> 5426.80]  don't worry
[5426.80 --> 5427.34]  we don't have
[5427.34 --> 5427.66]  the same
[5427.66 --> 5428.14]  we wouldn't have
[5428.14 --> 5428.68]  the same kind
[5428.68 --> 5429.10]  of agreement
[5429.10 --> 5431.12]  that Elric
[5431.12 --> 5431.50]  had
[5431.50 --> 5432.58]  so there you
[5432.58 --> 5433.88]  go
[5433.88 --> 5435.92]  wish you guys
[5435.92 --> 5436.36]  had some
[5436.36 --> 5436.84]  merchandise
[5436.84 --> 5438.58]  why is a fish
[5438.58 --> 5439.42]  when it swims
[5439.42 --> 5440.24]  also did you
[5440.24 --> 5440.80]  just start on
[5440.80 --> 5441.28]  the Windows 8
[5441.28 --> 5441.98]  no no we'll do
[5441.98 --> 5442.48]  the Windows 8
[5442.48 --> 5443.24]  giveaway soon
[5443.24 --> 5444.06]  what was that
[5444.06 --> 5444.42]  question
[5444.42 --> 5445.28]  I have no idea
[5445.28 --> 5446.22]  why is a fish
[5446.22 --> 5446.96]  when it swims
[5446.96 --> 5448.22]  the only
[5448.22 --> 5448.92]  okay so
[5448.92 --> 5449.76]  Richard is saying
[5449.76 --> 5450.64]  the only advantage
[5450.64 --> 5451.14]  would come
[5451.14 --> 5452.24]  from no commercials
[5452.24 --> 5453.44]  but that would
[5453.44 --> 5454.16]  again kill
[5454.16 --> 5454.98]  a major income
[5454.98 --> 5455.98]  source for YouTube
[5455.98 --> 5457.48]  but then YouTube
[5457.48 --> 5458.16]  is going to skim
[5458.16 --> 5459.18]  part of the profits
[5459.18 --> 5460.82]  and then the amount
[5460.82 --> 5461.94]  of bidded commercials
[5461.94 --> 5462.54]  will just go to
[5462.54 --> 5463.18]  other channels
[5463.18 --> 5464.06]  there's always
[5464.06 --> 5465.58]  videos on a channel
[5465.58 --> 5466.26]  that don't have
[5466.26 --> 5466.68]  a pre-roll
[5466.68 --> 5467.28]  that could have
[5467.28 --> 5467.74]  a pre-roll
[5467.74 --> 5468.22]  that's true
[5468.22 --> 5468.86]  you can never
[5468.86 --> 5469.98]  have too much
[5469.98 --> 5470.72]  ad inventory
[5470.72 --> 5472.92]  as an ad server
[5472.92 --> 5473.26]  so
[5473.26 --> 5473.50]  yeah
[5473.50 --> 5474.80]  and if you get
[5474.80 --> 5475.22]  too much
[5475.22 --> 5475.96]  people are paying
[5475.96 --> 5476.26]  more
[5476.26 --> 5476.96]  so like
[5476.96 --> 5478.96]  I wouldn't be
[5478.96 --> 5479.42]  worried about it
[5479.42 --> 5479.98]  if I was Google
[5479.98 --> 5481.54]  4chan apparently
[5481.54 --> 5482.80]  offers bypassing
[5482.80 --> 5483.30]  the captcha
[5483.30 --> 5484.08]  with the subscription
[5484.08 --> 5485.94]  okay
[5485.94 --> 5489.22]  which section
[5489.22 --> 5489.56]  of the forum
[5489.56 --> 5490.34]  can I find your story
[5490.34 --> 5490.78]  if you search
[5490.78 --> 5491.70]  for my story
[5491.70 --> 5492.98]  search for
[5492.98 --> 5493.50]  professional
[5493.50 --> 5494.04]  unboxing
[5494.04 --> 5494.64]  and it should
[5494.64 --> 5495.10]  show up
[5495.10 --> 5496.28]  I would pay
[5496.28 --> 5496.74]  a subscription
[5496.74 --> 5497.36]  to see slick
[5497.36 --> 5498.28]  pc bench press
[5498.28 --> 5498.56]  you
[5498.56 --> 5500.56]  oh man
[5500.56 --> 5501.80]  I think it will
[5501.80 --> 5502.76]  crash and burn
[5502.76 --> 5503.86]  I could see
[5503.86 --> 5504.32]  if it was like
[5504.32 --> 5504.90]  a TV show
[5504.90 --> 5505.42]  for example
[5505.42 --> 5505.80]  a video
[5505.80 --> 5506.48]  you could buy
[5506.48 --> 5507.30]  VGHS
[5507.30 --> 5507.98]  I was thinking
[5507.98 --> 5508.46]  about that
[5508.46 --> 5508.90]  but I don't
[5508.90 --> 5509.38]  think that's
[5509.38 --> 5510.04]  Freddy's angle
[5510.04 --> 5510.54]  like if it was
[5510.54 --> 5511.08]  more like a
[5511.08 --> 5511.96]  oh okay
[5511.96 --> 5512.70]  I don't think
[5512.70 --> 5513.26]  Freddy would do
[5513.26 --> 5513.52]  that
[5513.52 --> 5515.00]  considering he
[5515.00 --> 5515.42]  released it
[5515.42 --> 5515.98]  for free
[5515.98 --> 5516.74]  on his own
[5516.74 --> 5517.20]  website
[5517.20 --> 5522.28]  yeah I wonder
[5522.28 --> 5522.98]  what his model
[5522.98 --> 5523.70]  is exactly
[5523.70 --> 5525.24]  tons of views
[5525.24 --> 5526.14]  and epic videos
[5526.14 --> 5526.88]  yeah but tons
[5526.88 --> 5527.34]  of views
[5527.34 --> 5528.10]  don't inherently
[5528.10 --> 5528.86]  pay any money
[5528.86 --> 5530.56]  but he gets
[5530.56 --> 5532.40]  like 9 million
[5532.40 --> 5533.00]  views a video
[5533.00 --> 5533.74]  I know but
[5533.74 --> 5534.34]  no no I mean
[5534.34 --> 5534.92]  no no I
[5534.92 --> 5535.58]  okay yeah
[5535.58 --> 5535.82]  yeah yeah
[5535.82 --> 5536.30]  he gets tons
[5536.30 --> 5536.58]  of views
[5536.58 --> 5536.92]  and all that
[5536.92 --> 5537.52]  but his videos
[5537.52 --> 5538.28]  do cost money
[5538.28 --> 5538.64]  to make
[5538.64 --> 5539.28]  oh yeah
[5539.28 --> 5541.36]  and I think
[5541.36 --> 5542.00]  he's also got
[5542.00 --> 5542.66]  some partnerships
[5542.66 --> 5543.44]  and some sponsorship
[5543.44 --> 5544.62]  spots and some
[5544.62 --> 5547.28]  like in a lot
[5547.28 --> 5547.72]  of his
[5547.72 --> 5548.02]  do they do
[5548.02 --> 5548.40]  any product
[5548.40 --> 5548.68]  placement
[5548.68 --> 5549.76]  I think they
[5549.76 --> 5550.04]  do
[5550.04 --> 5550.90]  I'm pretty
[5550.90 --> 5551.70]  I know they
[5551.70 --> 5552.70]  did in VGHS
[5552.70 --> 5554.30]  like yes
[5554.30 --> 5555.02]  there was product
[5555.02 --> 5556.04]  placement in VGHS
[5556.04 --> 5556.90]  VGHS
[5556.90 --> 5558.06]  definitely Razer
[5558.06 --> 5558.94]  Razer was huge
[5558.94 --> 5559.76]  they all walked
[5559.76 --> 5560.38]  around with
[5560.38 --> 5562.12]  not the new one
[5562.12 --> 5562.64]  but that like
[5562.64 --> 5563.40]  gamepad thing
[5563.40 --> 5564.74]  oh okay
[5564.74 --> 5565.44]  the uh
[5565.44 --> 5565.82]  they walked
[5565.82 --> 5566.16]  around with
[5566.16 --> 5566.34]  those
[5566.34 --> 5566.86]  yeah
[5566.86 --> 5567.44]  and whenever
[5567.44 --> 5567.92]  they'd sit
[5567.92 --> 5568.26]  down to
[5568.26 --> 5568.54]  game
[5568.54 --> 5568.88]  it was like
[5568.88 --> 5569.62]  bam bam
[5569.62 --> 5570.00]  and it was all
[5570.00 --> 5570.22]  like
[5570.22 --> 5570.92]  it was supposed
[5570.92 --> 5571.58]  to be super
[5571.58 --> 5571.86]  epic
[5571.86 --> 5572.62]  but yeah
[5572.62 --> 5573.16]  you'd understand
[5573.16 --> 5573.74]  if you saw it
[5573.74 --> 5574.12]  they do it
[5574.12 --> 5574.48]  really well
[5574.48 --> 5575.14]  it's Freddy
[5575.14 --> 5575.74]  they do it
[5575.74 --> 5576.14]  really well
[5576.14 --> 5578.56]  uh okay
[5578.56 --> 5579.16]  yes we'll do
[5579.16 --> 5579.74]  a 900D
[5579.74 --> 5580.74]  unboxing for sure
[5580.74 --> 5581.90]  if it was
[5581.90 --> 5582.78]  like a TV show
[5582.78 --> 5583.30]  with the exact
[5583.30 --> 5583.88]  same standards
[5583.88 --> 5584.74]  it's not better
[5584.74 --> 5585.38]  like if
[5585.38 --> 5585.92]  Big Bang Theory
[5585.92 --> 5586.54]  was five dollars
[5586.54 --> 5586.82]  a month
[5586.82 --> 5587.28]  then yes
[5587.28 --> 5587.76]  however
[5587.76 --> 5588.46]  the argument
[5588.46 --> 5588.90]  there is
[5588.90 --> 5589.30]  well then why
[5589.30 --> 5589.78]  not just get
[5589.78 --> 5590.16]  a Netflix
[5590.16 --> 5590.70]  subscription
[5590.70 --> 5591.92]  which is
[5591.92 --> 5592.26]  already
[5592.26 --> 5593.34]  already exists
[5593.34 --> 5594.58]  then it's like
[5594.58 --> 5595.56]  15 bucks a month
[5595.56 --> 5595.90]  and you get
[5595.90 --> 5596.56]  absolutely everything
[5596.56 --> 5597.20]  including movies
[5597.20 --> 5597.98]  right
[5597.98 --> 5598.52]  like
[5598.52 --> 5600.72]  I don't know
[5600.72 --> 5601.18]  we'll see
[5601.18 --> 5601.80]  but I don't
[5601.80 --> 5602.18]  really get it
[5602.18 --> 5602.40]  yeah we'll see
[5602.40 --> 5604.28]  it will also attract
[5604.28 --> 5605.12]  major TV networks
[5605.12 --> 5605.56]  to switch
[5605.56 --> 5606.46]  so traditional TV
[5606.46 --> 5606.90]  can finally
[5606.90 --> 5608.18]  actually it won't
[5608.18 --> 5609.84]  traditional TV networks
[5609.84 --> 5610.76]  are going to
[5610.76 --> 5612.22]  fight this move
[5612.22 --> 5614.30]  tooth and nail
[5614.30 --> 5615.88]  because it will
[5615.88 --> 5616.70]  kill
[5616.70 --> 5617.56]  like
[5617.56 --> 5618.46]  okay remember
[5618.46 --> 5619.66]  your cable
[5619.66 --> 5620.22]  your cable provider
[5620.22 --> 5621.24]  is often
[5621.24 --> 5621.80]  affiliated
[5621.80 --> 5622.64]  in some way
[5622.64 --> 5623.76]  to some kind
[5623.76 --> 5624.34]  of a
[5624.34 --> 5625.88]  some kind
[5625.88 --> 5626.30]  of a network
[5626.30 --> 5626.84]  or studio
[5626.84 --> 5628.32]  so that means
[5628.32 --> 5628.98]  that they're
[5628.98 --> 5629.72]  collecting money
[5629.72 --> 5630.82]  at every level
[5630.82 --> 5631.44]  they're collecting
[5631.44 --> 5632.30]  money from the end
[5632.30 --> 5632.62]  user
[5632.62 --> 5633.82]  subscribing to the
[5633.82 --> 5634.20]  content
[5634.20 --> 5635.08]  they're collecting
[5635.08 --> 5636.32]  money from advertisers
[5636.32 --> 5637.38]  paying to be
[5637.38 --> 5638.08]  on the content
[5638.08 --> 5638.94]  so they're sitting
[5638.94 --> 5639.30]  in the middle
[5639.30 --> 5639.88]  going like
[5639.88 --> 5640.48]  yeah
[5640.48 --> 5643.16]  awesome place
[5643.16 --> 5643.54]  to be
[5643.54 --> 5644.78]  if they let
[5644.78 --> 5645.58]  content
[5645.58 --> 5646.62]  if they let
[5646.62 --> 5647.48]  content creators
[5647.48 --> 5648.54]  go to online
[5648.54 --> 5650.02]  and then advertisers
[5650.02 --> 5650.88]  start paying them
[5650.88 --> 5651.34]  directly
[5651.34 --> 5652.26]  and viewers
[5652.26 --> 5653.00]  start paying them
[5653.00 --> 5653.42]  directly
[5653.42 --> 5654.40]  they lose
[5654.40 --> 5656.24]  everything
[5656.24 --> 5657.24]  game over
[5657.24 --> 5658.10]  so they
[5658.10 --> 5658.60]  they will be
[5658.60 --> 5659.30]  they will not
[5659.30 --> 5660.08]  it will not attract
[5660.08 --> 5661.46]  anything from them
[5661.46 --> 5663.34]  I'm subbed to
[5663.34 --> 5664.00]  dozens of major
[5664.00 --> 5664.60]  YouTubers
[5664.60 --> 5665.78]  and if it's like
[5665.78 --> 5666.54]  five dollars a month
[5666.54 --> 5667.24]  each that's a bit much
[5667.24 --> 5667.94]  that's a good point
[5667.94 --> 5669.04]  because it depends
[5669.04 --> 5670.04]  on how they break it down
[5670.04 --> 5671.00]  that was the Netflix point
[5671.00 --> 5671.46]  yeah
[5671.46 --> 5673.28]  it's it's not worth it
[5673.28 --> 5673.54]  like
[5673.54 --> 5674.70]  so if you had
[5674.70 --> 5676.66]  YouTubers that
[5676.66 --> 5677.20]  um
[5677.20 --> 5678.28]  I don't know
[5678.28 --> 5679.32]  like what would it
[5679.32 --> 5680.22]  you know what makes
[5680.22 --> 5680.92]  more sense
[5680.92 --> 5681.44]  yeah
[5681.44 --> 5682.36]  is like paying
[5682.36 --> 5683.28]  per video
[5683.28 --> 5684.24]  because then
[5684.24 --> 5685.64]  people upload movies
[5685.64 --> 5686.10]  to YouTube
[5686.10 --> 5687.12]  it's usually just
[5687.12 --> 5688.70]  like indie stuff
[5688.70 --> 5689.92]  but if people started
[5689.92 --> 5691.24]  releasing serious
[5691.24 --> 5692.14]  business videos
[5692.14 --> 5693.06]  that were attached
[5693.06 --> 5694.02]  to your YouTube account
[5694.02 --> 5694.62]  that you could watch
[5694.62 --> 5695.66]  anywhere at any point
[5695.66 --> 5696.08]  in time
[5696.08 --> 5697.18]  through a really simple
[5697.18 --> 5697.68]  service
[5697.68 --> 5698.18]  just like on demand
[5698.18 --> 5698.62]  yeah
[5698.62 --> 5699.80]  like I think
[5699.80 --> 5700.78]  that might make more
[5700.78 --> 5701.78]  sense than a subscription
[5701.78 --> 5702.92]  so if we did an
[5702.92 --> 5703.68]  unboxing
[5703.68 --> 5704.74]  oh no
[5704.74 --> 5705.24]  okay let's say
[5705.24 --> 5705.98]  we don't do an unboxing
[5705.98 --> 5706.82]  let's say we do an
[5706.82 --> 5708.22]  unboxing of the 900d
[5708.22 --> 5709.14]  and we say
[5709.14 --> 5710.40]  guys we're gonna do
[5710.40 --> 5711.32]  like an epic
[5711.32 --> 5713.50]  cool 900d build video
[5713.50 --> 5714.72]  where it's like
[5714.72 --> 5715.60]  two hours long
[5715.60 --> 5716.30]  we fill the thing
[5716.30 --> 5716.90]  up to the nines
[5716.90 --> 5717.60]  but you have to pay
[5717.60 --> 5718.60]  two dollars to watch it
[5718.60 --> 5719.86]  I think they freak out
[5719.86 --> 5721.80]  I'm
[5721.80 --> 5723.02]  that wasn't the use case
[5723.02 --> 5723.96]  that I proposed at all
[5723.96 --> 5724.82]  this was movies
[5724.82 --> 5726.24]  like movie that's released
[5726.24 --> 5727.10]  in the movie theater
[5727.10 --> 5728.22]  you can then
[5728.22 --> 5729.18]  buy it
[5729.18 --> 5729.82]  on YouTube
[5729.82 --> 5730.74]  and be able to
[5730.74 --> 5731.16]  watch it at
[5731.16 --> 5731.48]  able to
[5731.48 --> 5731.94]  they have that
[5731.94 --> 5732.42]  don't they
[5732.42 --> 5733.40]  do they
[5733.40 --> 5734.10]  I think so
[5734.10 --> 5735.66]  but like who cares
[5735.66 --> 5736.34]  because Netflix
[5736.34 --> 5737.54]  I don't care
[5737.54 --> 5738.08]  that's probably why
[5738.08 --> 5738.84]  I don't know about it
[5738.84 --> 5739.28]  if it exists
[5739.28 --> 5740.22]  but like that's the only
[5740.22 --> 5740.96]  case that I would
[5740.96 --> 5742.28]  see it making sense
[5742.28 --> 5742.82]  I don't know
[5742.82 --> 5744.62]  I think channels
[5744.62 --> 5745.30]  that require paid
[5745.30 --> 5745.76]  subscription
[5745.76 --> 5746.70]  would see a huge
[5746.70 --> 5747.06]  view drop
[5747.06 --> 5747.56]  yeah of course
[5747.56 --> 5748.20]  or that
[5748.20 --> 5748.96]  if you pay for your
[5748.96 --> 5749.34]  subscription
[5749.34 --> 5750.42]  and that takes out ads
[5750.42 --> 5752.36]  just like how Twitch does it
[5752.36 --> 5752.58]  yeah
[5752.58 --> 5754.18]  I wouldn't mind that
[5754.18 --> 5754.72]  yeah
[5754.72 --> 5756.38]  content would have to be
[5756.38 --> 5757.70]  outrageously awesome
[5757.70 --> 5758.20]  yeah
[5758.20 --> 5759.86]  I think we can all agree on that
[5759.86 --> 5761.02]  Vimeo did something similar
[5761.02 --> 5762.00]  first with the tip jar
[5762.00 --> 5763.16]  but meh
[5763.16 --> 5764.04]  you know what
[5764.04 --> 5765.54]  here's the thing
[5765.54 --> 5767.02]  I liked Vimeo's approach
[5767.02 --> 5768.64]  honestly if YouTube had a tip jar
[5768.64 --> 5769.38]  I'd be stoked
[5769.38 --> 5771.28]  because if someone wants to give us a tip
[5771.28 --> 5771.84]  that's great
[5771.84 --> 5773.34]  but it should be voluntary
[5773.34 --> 5775.62]  that to me is more like
[5775.62 --> 5777.38]  the essence of what YouTube is
[5777.38 --> 5779.94]  creating this content voluntarily
[5779.94 --> 5782.28]  and then people supporting it voluntarily
[5782.28 --> 5783.60]  and if they want to support it
[5783.60 --> 5785.14]  with a couple bucks from their pocket
[5785.14 --> 5786.90]  then that's all voluntary too
[5786.90 --> 5788.68]  but making it sort of like
[5788.68 --> 5789.90]  you know
[5789.90 --> 5790.68]  like
[5790.68 --> 5791.62]  oh no
[5791.62 --> 5792.90]  you gotta jump this high
[5792.90 --> 5793.34]  if you wanna
[5793.34 --> 5794.30]  you wanna get the thing
[5794.30 --> 5795.06]  exactly
[5795.06 --> 5796.88]  like to me that's not quite
[5796.88 --> 5799.38]  yeah that's
[5799.38 --> 5800.92]  it's just not what I would like
[5800.92 --> 5801.64]  I like Vimeo
[5801.64 --> 5802.92]  Tommy J asked
[5802.92 --> 5804.46]  what happened to the Unbox Therapy
[5804.46 --> 5805.20]  collab giveaway
[5805.20 --> 5806.30]  it's coming
[5806.30 --> 5808.18]  Lou's been on vacation or something
[5808.18 --> 5809.12]  so when he gets back
[5809.12 --> 5809.66]  we'll pick a winner
[5809.66 --> 5810.26]  we'll announce it
[5810.26 --> 5811.16]  and everything will be good
[5811.16 --> 5812.14]  and hunky dory
[5812.14 --> 5813.08]  so
[5813.08 --> 5814.82]  speaking of giveaways
[5814.82 --> 5815.76]  you know what
[5815.76 --> 5817.00]  you're in charge of the Windows 8 giveaway
[5817.00 --> 5817.66]  because I have to pee
[5817.66 --> 5819.28]  okay
[5819.28 --> 5819.82]  so
[5819.82 --> 5821.14]  the question is
[5821.14 --> 5823.76]  who did Bill Gates buy DOS from
[5823.76 --> 5824.20]  oh
[5824.20 --> 5826.36]  don't announce the winner in real time
[5826.36 --> 5828.08]  because what I discovered last week
[5828.08 --> 5828.74]  is that
[5828.74 --> 5830.02]  who appeared to be the winner
[5830.02 --> 5831.70]  when I went back and looked at the timeline
[5831.70 --> 5832.18]  no I know
[5832.18 --> 5832.60]  yeah
[5832.60 --> 5833.52]  it wasn't right
[5833.52 --> 5833.88]  yeah
[5833.88 --> 5834.64]  okay
[5834.64 --> 5835.56]  so
[5835.56 --> 5836.56]  the question
[5836.56 --> 5837.66]  I guess
[5837.66 --> 5838.28]  you guys
[5838.28 --> 5839.24]  you guys kind of have part of it already
[5839.24 --> 5840.40]  anyways
[5840.40 --> 5841.46]  it's a two part question
[5841.46 --> 5842.56]  so anyone who's answered yet
[5842.56 --> 5843.54]  but let people guess
[5843.54 --> 5844.78]  until you see a correct answer
[5844.78 --> 5846.18]  or something
[5846.18 --> 5846.78]  I don't know
[5846.78 --> 5847.30]  make it fun
[5847.30 --> 5847.94]  I'll figure it out
[5847.94 --> 5850.42]  who did Bill Gates buy DOS from
[5850.42 --> 5851.72]  so you guys know that part already
[5851.72 --> 5854.62]  and what was its original name
[5854.62 --> 5857.06]  that's more probably the difficult one
[5857.06 --> 5861.54]  we've been doing stuff that's kind of newer content for these questions
[5861.54 --> 5863.00]  so I thought I'd jump back a little bit
[5863.00 --> 5864.92]  and hopefully people would appreciate that
[5864.92 --> 5867.46]  I don't want his name
[5867.46 --> 5868.94]  I want the company name
[5868.94 --> 5870.52]  sorry
[5870.52 --> 5871.66]  that was kind of my fault
[5871.66 --> 5872.40]  I should have specified
[5872.40 --> 5874.56]  I want the company name that he bought it from
[5874.56 --> 5876.28]  and not just
[5876.28 --> 5876.72]  I see
[5876.72 --> 5878.64]  person on screen
[5878.64 --> 5880.02]  if I can do this
[5880.02 --> 5880.34]  there
[5880.34 --> 5881.80]  you said
[5881.80 --> 5883.78]  the guy's name
[5883.78 --> 5884.82]  and the company name
[5884.82 --> 5886.14]  I want the name of the program
[5886.14 --> 5887.38]  and the company name
[5887.38 --> 5888.66]  just to be
[5888.66 --> 5890.62]  completely clear on that
[5890.62 --> 5895.00]  alright
[5895.00 --> 5896.36]  we have a correct answer
[5896.36 --> 5897.96]  I don't know if you were the first one
[5897.96 --> 5899.10]  like Linus just said
[5899.10 --> 5900.06]  we're going to review it afterwards
[5900.06 --> 5901.98]  but this guy has a correct answer
[5901.98 --> 5902.96]  it was Seattle Computer
[5902.96 --> 5905.80]  oh no you're wrong
[5905.80 --> 5908.64]  nope
[5908.64 --> 5909.32]  you're wrong
[5909.32 --> 5910.96]  continuing forward
[5910.96 --> 5915.22]  I feel much better
[5915.22 --> 5916.00]  thank you for asking
[5916.00 --> 5918.96]  maybe this is the right name
[5918.96 --> 5921.32]  Seattle Computer Products
[5921.32 --> 5924.04]  a lot of people are saying
[5924.04 --> 5925.16]  Seattle Computer Products
[5925.16 --> 5927.18]  did you have the wrong answer?
[5927.18 --> 5927.96]  I might have
[5927.96 --> 5929.36]  I have Seattle Computing
[5929.36 --> 5932.10]  but it might be Seattle Computer Products
[5932.10 --> 5934.96]  this is what happens
[5934.96 --> 5936.28]  when I put him in charge of things
[5936.28 --> 5937.12]  let me check
[5937.12 --> 5937.64]  you're fired
[5937.64 --> 5938.20]  let me check
[5938.20 --> 5940.52]  no you're fired
[5940.52 --> 5943.74]  this is what happens when you trust Wikipedia
[5943.74 --> 5947.18]  actually you probably didn't even go to Wikipedia
[5947.18 --> 5951.88]  I hope you guys have enjoyed the live stream
[5951.88 --> 5953.50]  I think we're pretty much done for the night
[5953.50 --> 5958.96]  yeah I'm still not sure if I'm going to live stream building my computer
[5958.96 --> 5959.94]  I may just build it
[5959.94 --> 5962.02]  and then shoot videos sort of
[5962.02 --> 5962.58]  yeah
[5962.58 --> 5963.18]  throughout the process
[5963.18 --> 5964.06]  Seattle Computer Products
[5964.06 --> 5965.30]  Seattle Computer Products
[5965.30 --> 5967.70]  so congratulations to everyone who answered correctly
[5967.70 --> 5971.24]  Slick will be responsible for going back and finding who won
[5971.24 --> 5974.60]  and then Slick what you need to do is follow that person on Twitter
[5974.60 --> 5976.28]  and get them to follow you
[5976.28 --> 5978.46]  so that they can message you directly
[5978.46 --> 5980.86]  so that you can send their email to me
[5980.86 --> 5981.74]  so that I can
[5981.74 --> 5983.78]  can I make them message me on the forum?
[5984.62 --> 5985.22]  uh sure
[5985.22 --> 5987.22]  that would be way easier
[5987.22 --> 5988.48]  my name on the forum is Slick
[5988.48 --> 5989.90]  no no get them to do it on Twitter
[5989.90 --> 5991.64]  because then you can validate the username
[5991.64 --> 5992.78]  yep
[5992.78 --> 5995.04]  but you don't have a hundred people messaging you on the forum
[5995.04 --> 5995.48]  yep yep yep
[5995.48 --> 5998.60]  everyone send Slick a private message on the forum
[5998.60 --> 5999.26]  nah
[5999.26 --> 5999.98]  okay
[5999.98 --> 6001.32]  no I'm joking
[6001.32 --> 6002.50]  please don't do that actually
[6002.50 --> 6004.00]  it would explode his inbox
[6004.00 --> 6005.00]  um
[6005.00 --> 6007.70]  my already exploding inbox
[6007.70 --> 6008.94]  yeah pretty much
[6008.94 --> 6011.00]  yeah
[6011.00 --> 6012.24]  where was I going with that?
[6012.52 --> 6012.90]  I don't know
[6012.90 --> 6014.52]  I don't think you were going necessarily anywhere
[6014.52 --> 6014.82]  but
[6014.82 --> 6015.94]  yeah I think we're kind of done
[6015.94 --> 6017.90]  sort of like after party time
[6017.90 --> 6019.68]  after party time?
[6020.06 --> 6020.28]  yeah
[6020.28 --> 6021.84]  we've never had an after party before
[6021.84 --> 6022.16]  no
[6022.16 --> 6023.80]  I think we're usually too tired
[6023.80 --> 6025.42]  are you tired today?
[6026.86 --> 6027.26]  uh
[6027.26 --> 6031.10]  I'm not going to bed right away
[6031.10 --> 6032.42]  seriously?
[6032.58 --> 6033.76]  you're going to play that now?
[6033.76 --> 6034.76]  I want to play 514
[6034.76 --> 6036.20]  and I've got the new stuff
[6036.20 --> 6037.22]  what if you have to work tomorrow?
[6037.22 --> 6038.66]  I'm not going to bed until the new stuff is set up
[6038.66 --> 6039.74]  seriously?
[6039.88 --> 6041.58]  oh you didn't even talk about your new stuff
[6041.58 --> 6042.58]  should I go grab it?
[6042.92 --> 6043.46]  I'm pretty excited
[6043.46 --> 6044.36]  no don't go grab it
[6044.36 --> 6044.72]  you sure?
[6045.72 --> 6046.06]  yes
[6046.06 --> 6047.18]  it's huge
[6047.18 --> 6048.08]  it's right there
[6048.08 --> 6049.90]  it's like 3 huge boxes
[6049.90 --> 6050.52]  I'm huge
[6050.52 --> 6051.28]  I'll go grab one
[6051.28 --> 6051.82]  you talk about it
[6051.82 --> 6052.56]  I'll go grab the next one
[6052.56 --> 6053.94]  what am I going to talk about is your stuff?
[6054.00 --> 6054.80]  okay I'll get it
[6054.80 --> 6055.92]  you talk about your stuff
[6055.92 --> 6057.84]  I don't want to talk about your stuff
[6057.84 --> 6058.48]  whatever man
[6058.48 --> 6059.58]  no it doesn't
[6059.58 --> 6062.02]  you particularly like my stuff
[6062.02 --> 6066.72]  so I bought two new Asus monitors
[6066.72 --> 6068.38]  because I've had some pretty
[6068.38 --> 6071.52]  not so great monitors for a little while
[6071.52 --> 6074.96]  one of them was a present from my dad
[6074.96 --> 6077.24]  when I got my very first computer
[6077.24 --> 6079.18]  like that was my own
[6079.18 --> 6080.68]  I had
[6080.68 --> 6083.36]  you should talk about your overall computer spec too
[6083.36 --> 6085.40]  here's the most exciting thing
[6085.40 --> 6086.04]  oh god
[6086.04 --> 6088.50]  random brown box
[6088.50 --> 6089.66]  with shipping label
[6089.66 --> 6091.56]  no that's not a particular shipping label
[6091.56 --> 6093.98]  I was actually confused when I first saw this
[6093.98 --> 6096.02]  because I bought a monitor arm
[6096.02 --> 6096.82]  for my desk
[6096.82 --> 6098.78]  from Ergotron
[6098.78 --> 6100.82]  but it came in this box
[6100.82 --> 6102.58]  that says juststand.org
[6102.58 --> 6103.14]  and I was like
[6103.14 --> 6104.96]  well I didn't buy it from juststand.org
[6104.96 --> 6106.12]  so
[6106.12 --> 6107.66]  what?
[6107.92 --> 6109.14]  but then on the side of the box
[6109.14 --> 6109.94]  it says Ergotron
[6109.94 --> 6112.00]  so I was pretty happy with that
[6112.00 --> 6113.90]  the idea is
[6113.90 --> 6114.70]  that
[6114.70 --> 6115.70]  ugh
[6115.70 --> 6116.20]  okay
[6116.20 --> 6117.56]  this guy
[6117.56 --> 6119.74]  this 24 inch
[6119.74 --> 6121.24]  freaking beast
[6121.24 --> 6121.98]  that I bought
[6121.98 --> 6123.94]  I have two of them
[6123.94 --> 6125.52]  they're going to go side by side on my desk
[6125.52 --> 6126.88]  these are going to be my main monitors
[6126.88 --> 6129.12]  I'm finally going to have some legit monitors
[6129.12 --> 6130.88]  because I didn't even have 1080p monitors
[6130.88 --> 6132.48]  and one of my monitors is still
[6132.48 --> 6133.68]  square layout
[6133.68 --> 6134.86]  like
[6134.86 --> 6135.92]  ugh
[6135.92 --> 6137.64]  I've been student budget for a long time
[6137.64 --> 6138.44]  so I've been running off
[6138.44 --> 6141.20]  the original monitor that I ever purchased
[6141.20 --> 6142.14]  for quite a while now
[6142.14 --> 6143.58]  um
[6143.58 --> 6145.22]  so those two will be side by side
[6145.22 --> 6146.72]  and then I'm going to be putting on an arm
[6146.72 --> 6147.86]  above those two
[6147.86 --> 6149.24]  um
[6149.24 --> 6151.32]  my old school 18 inch
[6151.32 --> 6153.86]  my old school 18 inch
[6153.86 --> 6154.70]  um
[6154.70 --> 6156.10]  and that is going to be
[6156.10 --> 6157.34]  to monitor servers
[6157.34 --> 6158.74]  instead of being a main monitor
[6158.74 --> 6160.34]  and then
[6160.34 --> 6161.58]  basically I'm replacing things
[6161.58 --> 6162.94]  that are absurdly old
[6162.94 --> 6163.94]  that are on my system
[6163.94 --> 6164.66]  and then
[6164.66 --> 6165.54]  I have had
[6165.54 --> 6166.58]  the same speakers
[6166.58 --> 6169.00]  that my brother and I
[6169.00 --> 6170.78]  we went to the mall
[6170.78 --> 6171.52]  with my mom
[6171.52 --> 6172.86]  and bought them from Staples
[6172.86 --> 6173.44]  aww
[6173.44 --> 6173.58]  with your mom
[6173.58 --> 6174.66]  when I was like
[6174.66 --> 6175.84]  grade 5
[6175.84 --> 6177.28]  because we didn't have any speakers
[6177.28 --> 6177.86]  on our computer
[6177.86 --> 6178.70]  to hear Diablo
[6178.70 --> 6179.50]  so
[6179.50 --> 6180.76]  I'm still running those
[6180.76 --> 6182.30]  like $25 speakers
[6182.30 --> 6187.10]  from however long ago
[6187.10 --> 6187.76]  so
[6187.76 --> 6189.14]  from reading
[6189.14 --> 6190.36]  a crazy amount of reviews
[6190.36 --> 6190.90]  and
[6190.90 --> 6192.06]  apparently
[6192.06 --> 6193.08]  listening to Linus
[6193.08 --> 6193.94]  apparently my
[6193.94 --> 6195.08]  personal endorsement
[6195.08 --> 6195.74]  of this product
[6195.74 --> 6196.90]  was not good enough for him
[6196.90 --> 6197.38]  he's all
[6197.38 --> 6198.30]  he's all hurt
[6198.30 --> 6199.54]  because I read reviews
[6199.54 --> 6200.28]  after he said it was good
[6200.28 --> 6201.24]  why would you read reviews
[6201.24 --> 6202.28]  about it after I told you
[6202.28 --> 6202.74]  to buy it
[6202.74 --> 6203.64]  you told me the 7H
[6203.64 --> 6204.02]  was good
[6204.02 --> 6205.56]  it didn't fit my freaking head
[6205.56 --> 6206.48]  did they
[6206.48 --> 6208.00]  I said they sounded good
[6208.00 --> 6209.96]  they also didn't fit my head
[6209.96 --> 6211.34]  but did they sound good
[6211.34 --> 6211.94]  they did
[6211.94 --> 6212.82]  they sounded very good
[6212.82 --> 6214.16]  they're very good headphones
[6214.16 --> 6215.00]  and I would recommend them
[6215.00 --> 6216.02]  to someone with a smaller head
[6216.02 --> 6216.42]  than me
[6216.42 --> 6218.34]  so basically you're saying
[6218.34 --> 6219.28]  you have too big of an ego
[6219.28 --> 6220.30]  to take my recommendations
[6220.30 --> 6220.96]  no
[6220.96 --> 6222.10]  I'm saying that I'm looking
[6222.10 --> 6223.02]  into anything else
[6223.02 --> 6223.94]  that might be different
[6223.94 --> 6224.74]  about the product
[6224.74 --> 6225.54]  okay so you were worried
[6225.54 --> 6226.08]  these speakers
[6226.08 --> 6226.88]  wouldn't fit your head
[6226.88 --> 6230.32]  that is an ego issue
[6230.32 --> 6231.34]  to be more specific
[6231.34 --> 6232.02]  I was looking up
[6232.02 --> 6232.88]  direct reviews
[6232.88 --> 6233.98]  that were comparing
[6233.98 --> 6235.82]  the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1s
[6235.82 --> 6236.32]  to these
[6236.32 --> 6237.26]  yeah but the Klipsch
[6237.26 --> 6238.64]  I could have told you
[6238.64 --> 6239.90]  the ProMedia 2.1s
[6239.90 --> 6240.78]  are not going to hold up
[6240.78 --> 6241.46]  in terms of bass
[6241.46 --> 6243.26]  my dad has the ProMedia 2.1s
[6243.26 --> 6243.98]  and I really like them
[6243.98 --> 6245.66]  and if you read reviews on it
[6245.66 --> 6246.76]  the ProMedia 2.1s
[6246.76 --> 6248.04]  are better at multiple ranges
[6248.04 --> 6249.12]  but these
[6249.12 --> 6250.16]  have a flat line
[6250.16 --> 6251.12]  I know exactly
[6251.12 --> 6252.84]  how good the ProMedia 2.1s are
[6252.84 --> 6254.16]  because I did a butt ton
[6254.16 --> 6255.14]  of research about them
[6255.14 --> 6256.64]  a billion years ago
[6256.64 --> 6257.52]  when they were released
[6257.52 --> 6258.70]  and you still didn't know
[6258.70 --> 6259.86]  the first thing about computers
[6259.86 --> 6261.04]  they've changed
[6261.04 --> 6261.82]  I know they have
[6261.82 --> 6262.88]  they've gotten like a lot worse
[6262.88 --> 6264.00]  yeah they're a lot worse now
[6264.00 --> 6265.32]  the original ones
[6265.32 --> 6266.26]  I would be
[6266.26 --> 6267.96]  there would be a competition
[6267.96 --> 6269.46]  I just wish I still had
[6269.46 --> 6271.28]  my ProMedia Ultra 5.1s
[6271.28 --> 6271.94]  this is what
[6271.94 --> 6272.94]  I thought by the way
[6272.94 --> 6273.98]  best computer speakers
[6273.98 --> 6274.76]  ever made
[6274.76 --> 6275.92]  bar none
[6275.92 --> 6278.18]  that's a shame
[6278.18 --> 6279.76]  I actually bought a set
[6279.76 --> 6281.18]  of SP2500s too
[6281.18 --> 6282.30]  I already have
[6282.30 --> 6283.48]  SP2500s
[6283.48 --> 6283.98]  but these were
[6283.98 --> 6284.66]  a really good deal
[6284.66 --> 6286.04]  they're like a factory refurb
[6286.04 --> 6287.34]  and it's Corsair
[6287.34 --> 6288.44]  so it can't be that bad
[6288.44 --> 6289.04]  yeah
[6289.04 --> 6290.80]  so I got a set
[6290.80 --> 6291.42]  for my wife
[6291.42 --> 6292.72]  so now she can get rid
[6292.72 --> 6294.42]  of the SphereX Xbox speakers
[6294.42 --> 6295.34]  that she's using now
[6295.34 --> 6296.68]  that have a little bit of hiss
[6296.68 --> 6298.24]  at close range
[6298.24 --> 6298.92]  like it'd be fine
[6298.92 --> 6299.74]  if you were using it
[6299.74 --> 6300.86]  with your entertainment center
[6300.86 --> 6301.28]  see this is
[6301.28 --> 6302.44]  this is what I'm talking about
[6302.44 --> 6304.04]  he brings this up now
[6304.04 --> 6304.62]  do you remember
[6304.62 --> 6305.64]  trying to sell those to me
[6305.64 --> 6306.88]  the SphereX's?
[6306.94 --> 6307.26]  yep
[6307.26 --> 6308.74]  how much was I going to
[6308.74 --> 6309.38]  charge you for them?
[6309.40 --> 6309.70]  you didn't tell me
[6309.70 --> 6310.42]  there was a hiss
[6310.42 --> 6311.52]  are you sure?
[6311.66 --> 6312.36]  100%
[6312.36 --> 6313.86]  I remember you saying
[6313.86 --> 6314.56]  that earlier today
[6314.56 --> 6315.16]  and I was like
[6315.16 --> 6316.26]  huh
[6316.26 --> 6318.04]  oh there's a way
[6318.04 --> 6318.84]  there's a workaround
[6318.84 --> 6319.92]  oh really?
[6320.26 --> 6320.68]  yeah no no
[6320.68 --> 6321.34]  there's a workaround
[6321.34 --> 6322.26]  then why is it a problem
[6322.26 --> 6323.02]  that she has those?
[6323.08 --> 6323.74]  because she's lazy
[6323.74 --> 6324.96]  do the workaround for her
[6324.96 --> 6325.62]  no no no
[6325.62 --> 6326.52]  the workaround is something
[6326.52 --> 6327.64]  you have to do every time
[6327.64 --> 6328.70]  oh that's annoying
[6328.70 --> 6329.90]  you switch to headphone mode
[6329.90 --> 6330.72]  when you're not using them
[6330.72 --> 6331.16]  as speakers
[6331.16 --> 6332.50]  oh
[6332.50 --> 6333.04]  well
[6333.04 --> 6333.42]  yeah
[6333.42 --> 6334.12]  that's
[6334.12 --> 6336.36]  she doesn't want to do it
[6336.36 --> 6337.30]  it's a woman
[6337.30 --> 6338.10]  but
[6338.10 --> 6339.68]  if you're not using
[6339.68 --> 6340.96]  your speakers as speakers
[6340.96 --> 6341.84]  it should always be
[6341.84 --> 6342.48]  in headphone mode
[6342.48 --> 6342.82]  yeah
[6342.82 --> 6344.16]  I don't know man
[6344.16 --> 6346.26]  like I said
[6346.26 --> 6347.14]  there's a workaround
[6347.14 --> 6347.88]  okay
[6347.88 --> 6348.68]  seriously
[6348.68 --> 6350.08]  but she doesn't want to do it
[6350.08 --> 6350.40]  so
[6350.40 --> 6352.36]  so I'm going to get rid of those
[6352.36 --> 6353.66]  and she'll get
[6353.66 --> 6354.80]  SP2500s
[6354.80 --> 6355.62]  which I know
[6355.62 --> 6356.60]  don't have any hiss
[6356.60 --> 6358.54]  I've heard that too
[6358.54 --> 6359.16]  yeah
[6359.16 --> 6359.94]  very very good
[6359.94 --> 6361.22]  you heard that
[6361.22 --> 6361.88]  it wasn't good enough
[6361.88 --> 6362.66]  that I told you that
[6362.66 --> 6365.12]  I read reviews for everything
[6365.12 --> 6365.88]  come on
[6365.88 --> 6366.20]  I do
[6366.20 --> 6367.14]  you read reviews for everything
[6367.14 --> 6368.40]  except the things that I ask you
[6368.40 --> 6369.42]  to read reviews for everything
[6369.42 --> 6371.38]  you did so much research
[6371.38 --> 6372.62]  about the PA series
[6372.62 --> 6374.08]  you found out stuff
[6374.08 --> 6375.34]  that I couldn't figure out
[6375.34 --> 6376.08]  back when I was doing
[6376.08 --> 6376.72]  the unboxings
[6376.72 --> 6377.32]  like the difference
[6377.32 --> 6378.32]  between the R-Skew
[6378.32 --> 6379.42]  and the non-R-Skew
[6379.42 --> 6380.38]  and the QR's
[6380.38 --> 6381.06]  and the R-R-Skew
[6381.06 --> 6381.56]  and the QR's
[6381.56 --> 6382.20]  and the R-R-Skew
[6382.20 --> 6382.98]  I think it took me
[6382.98 --> 6384.12]  forever to figure that out
[6384.12 --> 6385.22]  when I give him something
[6385.22 --> 6385.64]  and I'm like
[6385.64 --> 6386.70]  okay we're doing an unboxing
[6386.70 --> 6387.16]  of this
[6387.16 --> 6387.82]  no no no no
[6387.82 --> 6387.92]  hold on
[6387.92 --> 6388.42]  hold on
[6388.42 --> 6389.58]  I'm gonna find
[6389.58 --> 6390.72]  one of the pieces of paper
[6390.72 --> 6391.40]  you hand me
[6391.40 --> 6392.76]  okay
[6392.76 --> 6394.00]  but he gives me like
[6394.00 --> 6395.04]  two to five minutes
[6395.04 --> 6396.04]  hold on
[6396.04 --> 6396.88]  I'm finding a piece of paper
[6396.88 --> 6398.08]  so it's not exactly fair
[6398.08 --> 6399.30]  that's like two to five minutes
[6399.30 --> 6400.26]  from where we're talking
[6400.26 --> 6401.46]  so by the time I actually
[6401.46 --> 6402.20]  get to the computer
[6402.20 --> 6402.84]  I've got like
[6402.84 --> 6404.54]  one to four minutes left
[6404.54 --> 6405.34]  you come up with like
[6405.34 --> 6406.58]  three facts about it
[6406.58 --> 6407.72]  that are all on the box
[6407.72 --> 6408.70]  when I'm like
[6408.70 --> 6409.04]  no no
[6409.04 --> 6410.04]  the things I need to know
[6410.04 --> 6410.46]  about it
[6410.46 --> 6411.62]  I don't know what's on the box
[6411.62 --> 6412.64]  when I'm looking it up online
[6412.64 --> 6414.88]  maybe you should start
[6414.88 --> 6415.90]  with looking at the box
[6415.90 --> 6416.72]  also it doesn't give me
[6416.72 --> 6417.60]  the box most of the time
[6417.60 --> 6420.04]  not
[6420.04 --> 6421.46]  not fair accusations
[6421.46 --> 6422.96]  this is when I've got
[6422.96 --> 6423.44]  like I
[6423.44 --> 6425.14]  meticulously research products
[6425.14 --> 6425.64]  that I buy
[6425.64 --> 6426.56]  because I want to make sure
[6426.56 --> 6427.50]  that I'm buying the right thing
[6427.50 --> 6428.40]  because the products
[6428.40 --> 6429.78]  he buys matter more to him
[6429.78 --> 6430.38]  than the products
[6430.38 --> 6431.64]  that he's making videos
[6431.64 --> 6432.22]  about for you
[6432.22 --> 6432.54]  no
[6432.54 --> 6434.38]  you only give me
[6434.38 --> 6435.46]  two to five minutes
[6435.46 --> 6436.66]  that's what you just said
[6436.66 --> 6438.10]  I spend hours on these
[6438.10 --> 6440.56]  how do you have time for this
[6440.56 --> 6441.76]  I don't sleep
[6441.76 --> 6443.78]  I told you
[6443.78 --> 6445.40]  there was foreign problems
[6445.40 --> 6445.80]  last night
[6445.80 --> 6446.32]  so I was up until
[6446.32 --> 6446.92]  four in the morning
[6446.92 --> 6449.24]  that kind of stuff happens
[6449.24 --> 6450.62]  so was Mr. Wizard
[6450.62 --> 6451.58]  oh
[6451.58 --> 6452.78]  hi Mr. Wizard
[6452.78 --> 6453.48]  if you're watching
[6453.48 --> 6456.64]  everyone's tuning out
[6456.64 --> 6457.18]  to the live stream
[6457.18 --> 6458.10]  they don't want to watch this
[6458.10 --> 6458.78]  you're boring
[6458.78 --> 6459.86]  you're boring
[6459.86 --> 6460.50]  you're boring them
[6460.50 --> 6461.36]  it's your live stream
[6461.36 --> 6462.14]  that's true
[6462.14 --> 6463.02]  it's my live stream
[6463.02 --> 6464.62]  alright
[6464.62 --> 6465.10]  okay
[6465.10 --> 6465.88]  we're done now
[6465.88 --> 6466.38]  we're done now
[6466.38 --> 6466.90]  okay
[6466.90 --> 6468.22]  goodnight guys
[6468.22 --> 6469.52]  thank you for watching
[6469.52 --> 6470.72]  we'll see you again next time
[6470.72 --> 6471.74]  and as always
[6471.74 --> 6473.28]  stay safe
[6473.28 --> 6475.04]  and don't ride bicycles
[6475.04 --> 6475.72]  at night
[6475.72 --> 6476.64]  with all black clothing
[6476.64 --> 6483.56]  I just figured out
[6483.56 --> 6484.32]  why it was lagging
[6484.32 --> 6485.94]  your local recording
[6485.94 --> 6487.54]  and your recording
[6487.54 --> 6488.72]  yeah
[6488.72 --> 6489.32]  there we go
[6489.32 --> 6490.44]  is that better now
[6490.44 --> 6491.44]  yeah
[6491.44 --> 6492.38]  that's better now
[6492.38 --> 6493.46]  are we still live
[6493.46 --> 6494.28]  does everyone know
[6494.28 --> 6495.32]  that you just did that
[6495.32 --> 6495.58]  yeah
[6495.58 --> 6497.22]  you should probably
[6497.22 --> 6498.16]  turn it off now
[6498.16 --> 6499.56]  I think I'm going to
[6499.56 --> 6499.86]  delay
[6499.86 --> 6501.02]  so you can feel awkward
[6501.02 --> 6502.32]  where do I even go
[6502.32 --> 6502.74]  right here
[6502.74 --> 6503.84]  oh
[6503.84 --> 6505.30]  oh
