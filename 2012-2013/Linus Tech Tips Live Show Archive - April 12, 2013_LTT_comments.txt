Do some research. The important thing is the differences between "domesticated", "tamed" and "trained". A serval can never be domesticated, but it can be tamed making it no more dangerous than a domesticated breed. 
A tiger on the other hand can be trained, but NEVER tamed. It is a predator to the core and you will always look like food to a tiger. Servals hunt small game. People do not look like food to them.

The great thing about 4k is that it's 4x 1080p. That means you could run at 1080p and you'd just effectively have 4x bigger pixels. Scaling with no ugly interpolation artifacts.
