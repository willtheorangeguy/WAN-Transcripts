[0.00 → 6.00] And we're live! Welcome to the live stream guys! We made it!
[8.00 → 18.00] We're here in our new studio space, and we have a new setup and of course that combines extremely well with...
[19.00 → 21.00] What do you want?
[21.00 → 36.00] Okay, so we're here in our new studio with our new setup which includes sort of running our third scene off of my laptop which apparently this is stuck on something.
[37.00 → 40.00] No, I'll just pull on it. That can only end well.
[41.00 → 42.00] That's not going to end well.
[42.00 → 43.00] When in doubt, force it.
[43.00 → 45.00] That's not going to end well! Wait a second!
[45.00 → 46.00] It could end well!
[46.00 → 47.00] No, it works!
[47.00 → 48.00] Yes, it will!
[48.00 → 49.00] See, it ended well.
[49.00 → 50.00] Because I...
[50.00 → 59.00] I pulled on it which caused a problem for you and your sense of the way things should work which meant you rushed over there and fixed it for me. That ended well.
[59.00 → 60.00] Pulling on cables is like...
[61.00 → 64.00] So let's see if this is still working. Hey, hey! That's still working too!
[64.00 → 66.00] Not a very good tech tip. Yank on the cables.
[66.00 → 74.00] Yank on the cables as long as there's someone nearby who cares about that cable and will protect it from you.
[74.00 → 77.00] That's my King. So I kind of...
[77.00 → 80.00] Oh! Oh! And I was going to break the mouse too!
[80.00 → 81.00] Excellent!
[82.00 → 83.00] Really? This is yours?
[83.00 → 84.00] Yeah.
[84.00 → 85.00] Oh!
[86.00 → 87.00] Cool!
[87.00 → 108.00] Alright, so let's go ahead, and I'm going to crack open the Twitch chat. Also, I think we've got a fair bit to talk about this week because you were not here last week. Why don't you update the audience on where you are? Even though I actually think I told them probably about half a dozen times during the stream last week because people kept joining, and then they kept asking. So carry on.
[108.00 → 118.00] You said where I am. So technically I'm in the new studio. But where I was Korea and I didn't actually land when the stream started. I landed like a while after the stream ended.
[118.00 → 119.00] Right.
[119.00 → 120.00] Yeah.
[120.00 → 126.00] Why did we think you were going to be on time for the stream? Because we had your flight details like two, three weeks before we left.
[127.00 → 129.00] Yeah. I don't know what happened.
[129.00 → 131.00] Yeah. I don't know why we thought that was possible.
[131.00 → 146.00] Because I was like hours late. Like hours and hours late. Like I didn't get home until... well we went and had dinner afterwards. But I didn't get home. If I minus the time of dinner I didn't get home until like ten. Which is hours after the stream.
[146.00 → 147.00] Right.
[147.00 → 150.00] When did we... well that would have been okay to join me during the old stream.
[150.00 → 151.00] The old stream.
[151.00 → 152.00] Is that what we were thinking?
[152.00 → 156.00] That might have been it. Because technically we were still in the old stream time when we first started doing the trip details.
[156.00 → 163.00] That might be it. But then we didn't factor in. Okay. So tell us about your trip to... you've told me nothing about your trip to Korea. What happened that first night?
[163.00 → 170.00] The first... uh... I don't know how much I should... have you heard anything about the first night?
[170.00 → 172.00] No. I know nothing.
[172.00 → 174.00] Huh. How into details?
[174.00 → 177.00] I know you were... I know you were stuck in Korea. That's all I know.
[177.00 → 182.00] Okay. I'll go through the play by play. I don't know if I... anyway. Furthermore, I'll just do it. Whatever.
[182.00 → 191.00] Um... so I land... my... I have three phones on me right now. Because I had the Note 1, Blackberry, and my S3.
[191.00 → 192.00] Okay. And I had my laptop. Right?
[192.00 → 193.00] Right.
[193.00 → 202.00] Laptop's dead. Blackberry's dead. Note's dead. S3 has 13%. Or okay. Laptop's not dead. Laptop had about... 15%. S3 had about 10-15%.
[202.00 → 203.00] Okay.
[203.00 → 208.00] So everything's pretty much dead. But my assumption was... a ton of people in Taipei could speak English.
[208.00 → 209.00] Oh yeah.
[209.00 → 211.00] A ton of people. You could get around fairly easily, right?
[211.00 → 213.00] Yeah, but there was a convention in town.
[213.00 → 216.00] But there was a convention in town. But a lot of people that just worked in the stores or whatever...
[216.00 → 217.00] Sure.
[217.00 → 219.00] ...could like at least point you in the right direction.
[219.00 → 220.00] Yeah. However...
[220.00 → 223.00] If you're like, t-shirt! Extra, extra, extra large!
[223.00 → 224.00] They could kinda handle it.
[224.00 → 226.00] They could get you to where you need to go. Sure.
[226.00 → 228.00] Food, water, hotel, whatever kind of work.
[228.00 → 229.00] Yeah.
[229.00 → 230.00] No.
[230.00 → 231.00] Not in Korea.
[231.00 → 232.00] Not in Korea.
[232.00 → 233.00] The airport was good.
[233.00 → 236.00] And when I first landed in the airport, I was like, alright, I'm good. This is good.
[236.00 → 239.00] By the way, when I first landed in the airport, someone ran up to me.
[239.00 → 243.00] Because I'm wearing... it's really bright in the area because there are lights everywhere and white floors.
[243.00 → 246.00] And I just got off a pitch black plane because everyone had their windows closed.
[246.00 → 248.00] So I had my aviators on because my eyes were still readjusting.
[248.00 → 251.00] So I have my aviators on. I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt.
[251.00 → 254.00] And this dude runs up to me, and he's like, military, military, military!
[254.00 → 256.00] And he looks furious.
[256.00 → 257.00] And I'm like, what the heck?
[257.00 → 259.00] And I kinda thought about it and...
[259.00 → 261.00] We had talked about this previously.
[261.00 → 263.00] All the American GIs that are in...
[263.00 → 264.00] Ohhhhhhh.
[264.00 → 266.00] Some of that is being happily accepted.
[266.00 → 269.00] Some of that is not being happily accepted.
[269.00 → 273.00] So I didn't know what this guy's position was, but he was yelling military at me and looked really pissed off.
[273.00 → 277.00] So I flashed my Canadian passport and was like, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[277.00 → 278.00] No, no.
[278.00 → 280.00] Canada has no military.
[280.00 → 281.00] It's okay.
[281.00 → 282.00] We have some rowboats.
[282.00 → 283.00] We make it by.
[283.00 → 286.00] I heard we had a submarine at one point.
[286.00 → 287.00] Really?
[287.00 → 288.00] Like one.
[288.00 → 289.00] Why?
[289.00 → 290.00] I don't know.
[290.00 → 293.00] Anyway, we bought it used from the British or something like that.
[293.00 → 294.00] Seems like a terrible idea.
[294.00 → 296.00] I know, right?
[296.00 → 297.00] Man.
[297.00 → 298.00] Dumb.
[298.00 → 299.00] Anyway.
[299.00 → 301.00] So I flashed my passport, whatever.
[301.00 → 302.00] Get it across that I'm not military.
[302.00 → 309.00] He says okay and actually was nice and ended up escorting me to the express train into Seoul.
[309.00 → 311.00] So I get onto the express train into Seoul.
[311.00 → 312.00] Everything seems fine.
[312.00 → 319.00] I ran into an actually American GI there, so I wasn't surprised that he was asking if I was one.
[319.00 → 322.00] And I get to Seoul Station, which is like Seoul Central Station.
[322.00 → 324.00] It's this huge hub for transit.
[324.00 → 327.00] Tons of trains and everything all there.
[327.00 → 331.00] But then, right when I get to Seoul Central Station, no one speaks English.
[331.00 → 332.00] Right.
[332.00 → 338.00] I try to go get on one of the trains and there's no like coin slot or bill slot or anything.
[338.00 → 339.00] So I have no idea what's going on.
[339.00 → 344.00] I see some people with these like cards that they're hitting against the thing and it beeps.
[344.00 → 346.00] So I'm like, okay, like people have NFC cards.
[346.00 → 347.00] How do I get one of these?
[347.00 → 348.00] Like I have no idea what I'm doing.
[348.00 → 349.00] Okay.
[349.00 → 350.00] I start asking around.
[350.00 → 351.00] I don't know what the currency rate is.
[351.00 → 355.00] And I go to the ATM and go to pull out money and the minimum pull out is like $50,000.
[355.00 → 356.00] Right.
[356.00 → 357.00] Okay.
[357.00 → 358.00] Right.
[358.00 → 363.00] So hopefully the conversion is pretty, uh, pretty scaled out there.
[363.00 → 364.00] Yeah.
[364.00 → 367.00] Because I have no idea how much I'm pulling out of the ATM.
[367.00 → 370.00] Um, and my phone's dead and there's not very much free Wi-Fi.
[370.00 → 371.00] Huh.
[371.00 → 374.00] In Seoul Central Station, there was no free Wi-Fi.
[374.00 → 375.00] Right.
[375.00 → 376.00] Okay.
[376.00 → 377.00] Which is nuts.
[377.00 → 378.00] There's a McDonald's there.
[378.00 → 380.00] There's a bunch of stuff there that I would expect from being in Canada that there
[380.00 → 382.00] would be free Wi-Fi there.
[382.00 → 386.00] So I'm thinking, okay, I might be getting through one of these Wi-Fi portals.
[386.00 → 391.00] I might be able to get Wi-Fi access because some of them I'm clicking random Korean buttons
[391.00 → 392.00] hoping that it works.
[392.00 → 395.00] And like, I think I might be getting through one, but my phone's starting to die because
[395.00 → 396.00] I've been doing this for a while.
[396.00 → 398.00] I've been at Seoul Central Station for a little while now.
[398.00 → 399.00] Okay.
[399.00 → 401.00] So I go to McDonald's hoping that they have Wi-Fi.
[401.00 → 404.00] They don't, but either way, I stash all my stuff.
[404.00 → 408.00] I load up my laptop, put it into sleep and close it so that I can drain the battery from
[408.00 → 409.00] my laptop into my phone.
[409.00 → 411.00] Because at this point in time, I'm like, my phone's more important.
[411.00 → 414.00] And there are no plugs that I can use.
[414.00 → 416.00] Public power management tips right there.
[416.00 → 418.00] Drain your laptop into your phone.
[418.00 → 420.00] Yeah, there's no power plugs I can use.
[420.00 → 421.00] Right, okay.
[421.00 → 422.00] Because I have a North American plug.
[422.00 → 423.00] And you don't have a travel adapter yet.
[423.00 → 426.00] And I don't have a travel adapter because diesel does.
[426.00 → 427.00] Right.
[427.00 → 429.00] And he was supposed to be going before you.
[429.00 → 434.00] But it ended up that I was going before him so I could catch WCS Star Craft.
[434.00 → 439.00] So, sit down in this McDonald's, trying to drain my laptop, trying to listen to people
[439.00 → 443.00] around me and catch keywords to see if I can quickly translate anything on the fly.
[443.00 → 445.00] Like, I'm trying to document everything I can, right?
[445.00 → 446.00] Yeah.
[446.00 → 450.00] I start just writing down random names of the things at McDonald's that I know would
[450.00 → 452.00] be like translations of hamburger.
[452.00 → 453.00] Okay.
[453.00 → 455.00] So I can like to ask for food and stuff.
[455.00 → 457.00] Like, I'm trying to, I'm like, I'm screwed.
[457.00 → 461.00] I need to get whatever information I can because I'm screwed.
[461.00 → 466.00] And, brilliant me, when I was in the airport, someone asked if I wanted a rental phone.
[466.00 → 468.00] But it was 9,000 dollars, or 9,000 won a day.
[468.00 → 469.00] Okay.
[469.00 → 470.00] So it seemed way too expensive.
[470.00 → 473.00] I didn't know the currency conversion, so I didn't get it.
[473.00 → 475.00] So I didn't have a rental phone yet.
[475.00 → 476.00] Awesome!
[476.00 → 481.00] And I knew there was other stuff you could do, and I assumed free Wi-Fi everywhere.
[481.00 → 483.00] And if free Wi-Fi was everywhere, I knew I'd be able to make it by.
[483.00 → 484.00] Right.
[484.00 → 485.00] So I wasn't worried.
[485.00 → 487.00] I could WhatsApp diesel, I could do whatever I could communicate.
[487.00 → 490.00] I really assumed free Wi-Fi everywhere because I'm in Korea, right?
[490.00 → 492.00] Apparently that's not a thing.
[492.00 → 495.00] So I don't have a rental phone, all that kind of stuff.
[495.00 → 498.00] While I'm sitting there, this one chick looks at me, and she's like,
[498.00 → 500.00] Hey, are you new here?
[500.00 → 501.00] In perfect English.
[501.00 → 503.00] And I'm like, yes!
[503.00 → 506.00] You can save me, this is so good!
[506.00 → 511.00] So I start talking to them for a little bit, and then they're like, let's go get food.
[511.00 → 513.00] So I'm like, okay, there's two of them.
[513.00 → 514.00] Yay!
[514.00 → 515.00] We can go get food!
[515.00 → 519.00] So before I leave, I get them to go to the ATM with me and help me figure out what the currency conversion is.
[519.00 → 520.00] Sure, okay.
[520.00 → 521.00] Ends up being super easy.
[521.00 → 522.00] Right.
[522.00 → 524.00] 200,000 is basically 200 bucks.
[524.00 → 525.00] Okay.
[525.00 → 528.00] There's a scale off, like it's probably plus or minus 20 bucks or something.
[528.00 → 529.00] Sure.
[529.00 → 532.00] But it's close enough that it's like somewhere around there, right?
[532.00 → 538.00] So I pull out some money, we go for food, they teach me some of the customs with like eating
[538.00 → 540.00] food and going to restaurants and how to like deal with people and stuff.
[540.00 → 541.00] Okay.
[541.00 → 543.00] They taught me a few words that could help me get by.
[543.00 → 547.00] Like if you're trying to hail someone down, how to do it if it's a guy, how to do it if
[547.00 → 548.00] it's a girl.
[548.00 → 549.00] Okay.
[549.00 → 550.00] Hello.
[550.00 → 551.00] Sure.
[551.00 → 552.00] Just like random little things like that.
[552.00 → 554.00] Like I learned some really basic stuff.
[554.00 → 559.00] Um, and they helped me out and then like we're going around, cruising around, checking out
[559.00 → 560.00] different shops and different restaurants and stuff.
[560.00 → 566.00] And I'm like, okay, I need to get like a hotel because I need to sleep before WCS tomorrow.
[566.00 → 569.00] Because at this point I still want to go to the Star Craft event.
[569.00 → 570.00] Right.
[570.00 → 571.00] I haven't had...
[571.00 → 572.00] That's a high priority.
[572.00 → 573.00] Oh, it is.
[573.00 → 574.00] It's definitely a high priority.
[574.00 → 575.00] Okay.
[575.00 → 579.00] I've had no time online yet since hitting Korea.
[579.00 → 580.00] Right.
[580.00 → 581.00] So I have no idea what's going on.
[581.00 → 582.00] Which explains why I didn't hear from you.
[582.00 → 583.00] Yeah.
[583.00 → 584.00] Okay.
[584.00 → 585.00] Or anyone.
[585.00 → 586.00] Yeah.
[586.00 → 587.00] Like my mom's freaking out.
[587.00 → 588.00] Yeah.
[588.00 → 589.00] You know my mom.
[589.00 → 590.00] Oh, I'm sure your mom was freaking out.
[590.00 → 591.00] Not happy.
[591.00 → 593.00] Um, so I'm cruising around Korea.
[593.00 → 594.00] You know she Face booked me, right?
[594.00 → 595.00] Did she really?
[595.00 → 596.00] Yes.
[596.00 → 597.00] While I was in Korea.
[597.00 → 598.00] Yeah.
[598.00 → 599.00] Asking if you had any info.
[599.00 → 604.00] Saying that because I think by the time I had reached her, she had her phone.
[604.00 → 609.00] So something about the only reason I'm still alive is that she's heard from you by now
[609.00 → 610.00] or something like that.
[610.00 → 611.00] That sounds about right.
[611.00 → 612.00] Okay.
[612.00 → 615.00] Um, so I'm like, hey, I need to get somewhere.
[615.00 → 618.00] I figure out that I'm in like the bottom of Seoul.
[618.00 → 621.00] And where I wanted to end up was way up in the top of Seoul.
[621.00 → 622.00] Okay.
[622.00 → 623.00] At this point in time, transit's down.
[623.00 → 624.00] Sure.
[624.00 → 627.00] Um, like I don't know how to talk to taxis.
[627.00 → 628.00] Like it's not a good situation.
[628.00 → 629.00] Okay.
[629.00 → 631.00] Um, but I don't know how to talk to taxis.
[631.00 → 632.00] Like it's not a good situation.
[632.00 → 633.00] Okay.
[633.00 → 638.00] Um, so the one chick is like, you can just stay at our dorms.
[638.00 → 642.00] That's what my mom did.
[642.00 → 644.00] It ended up being fine.
[644.00 → 645.00] Uh huh.
[645.00 → 651.00] So I crashed on the floor of the one chick's dorm room and then, um, the one girl's boyfriend
[651.00 → 653.00] took me to WCS in the morning.
[653.00 → 654.00] Okay.
[654.00 → 655.00] And then that was great.
[655.00 → 660.00] And then I got to see, I went to GO Studio, which is like my two, two of my favourite casters,
[660.00 → 661.00] Tasteless and Artois.
[661.00 → 662.00] Sure.
[662.00 → 665.00] Not Day9, who is my actual favourite caster, but two of my favourite casters.
[665.00 → 668.00] Um, got to see them do the semifinals, which was great.
[668.00 → 672.00] Um, talked to them, got them to sign my Star Craft box, which I gave to my brother.
[672.00 → 673.00] That was the box with the writing.
[673.00 → 674.00] Okay.
[674.00 → 675.00] Sure.
[675.00 → 676.00] So I brought my Star Craft Heart of the Swarm box.
[676.00 → 680.00] I got both of them to sign it because my brother's a caster, and he loves casters.
[680.00 → 681.00] Right.
[681.00 → 682.00] Okay.
[682.00 → 683.00] So I got them to sign that.
[683.00 → 684.00] I ended up giving that to my brother.
[684.00 → 687.32] And then I talked to them about where the finals actually were because they were casting
[687.32 → 689.00] it as a spectator.
[689.00 → 690.00] Oh, okay.
[690.00 → 691.00] Okay.
[691.00 → 694.00] And then I got on them and a screen in their desk that was the Star Craft.
[694.00 → 695.00] I see.
[695.00 → 696.00] Okay.
[696.00 → 697.00] And when they're casting, most of the time the Star Craft stream is on the screen.
[697.00 → 700.00] So they got to just stare at it and talk about it while it's going on.
[700.00 → 701.00] Right.
[701.00 → 704.00] But they weren't actually live at the event and the event was in Korea.
[704.00 → 706.00] So I got to see the semifinals with them, which was awesome.
[706.00 → 709.00] But then I wanted to go to the big arena event because I was like, okay, I'm in Korea.
[709.00 → 713.00] I got to go to a Star Craft event in an arena because that's awesome.
[713.00 → 719.00] So Tasteless, which is one of the guys who like, I didn't have a marker from to sign
[719.00 → 723.00] my thing because I don't know how to buy a marker in Korea because I like couldn't
[723.00 → 727.00] find a stationery store because I'm like, where the heck am I supposed to go?
[727.00 → 731.00] I mean, I don't want to generalize, but based on all the Korean exchange students that have
[731.00 → 735.00] ever come to my school when I was in like high school and all the stationary that they
[735.00 → 736.00] carry with them.
[736.00 → 737.00] It should be everywhere.
[737.00 → 738.00] I think they have storage for that.
[738.00 → 739.00] It should be everywhere.
[739.00 → 742.00] We ended up, I ended up finding an insane school supply station.
[742.00 → 745.00] Yeah, like they probably have like every colour of everything in a pencil.
[745.00 → 746.00] Oh yeah, it was nuts.
[746.00 → 747.00] But that was a few days down the line.
[747.00 → 748.00] Not that I'm generalizing.
[748.00 → 750.00] It's just, I mean, you can't help but make observations.
[750.00 → 751.00] Anyway, go ahead.
[751.00 → 753.00] Yeah, I did find that place.
[753.00 → 754.00] Okay.
[754.00 → 760.00] Engine, also known as by now Diesel and I call him Proxy, but that's a whole other story.
[760.00 → 761.00] Proxy, sure.
[761.00 → 762.00] Oh, oh, okay.
[762.00 → 763.00] Yeah.
[763.00 → 765.00] That intern guy, yeah, he ended up showing us one.
[765.00 → 766.00] It was awesome.
[766.00 → 767.00] But that was a few days down the line.
[767.00 → 769.00] That's when after I had met up with both of them.
[769.00 → 770.00] Right.
[770.00 → 771.00] This was when I was still on my own.
[771.00 → 777.00] Um, so, Tasteless and I are like pulling out tables and stuff, trying to find, like sliding
[777.00 → 780.00] tables away from walls, trying to open drawers to find, try and find a marker.
[780.00 → 781.00] He was actually pretty awesome.
[781.00 → 784.00] I ended up finding a marker so he signed the box for my brother.
[784.00 → 787.00] I talked to him for a little bit, and then he walked me outside and pointed down a bridge.
[787.00 → 789.00] And was just like, go down there, you'll see arenas.
[789.00 → 791.00] And then it's the one in the back.
[791.00 → 794.00] So I'm like, okay, time to go.
[794.00 → 795.00] I guess.
[795.00 → 800.00] So I just walked down the street, get to the arenas, walk through like some security gate,
[800.00 → 802.00] just pretended that I was totally confident.
[802.00 → 804.00] There was totally nothing wrong with me walking through this security gate.
[804.00 → 807.00] Like, tall white dude in Korea.
[807.00 → 809.00] He's not going to stand out at all.
[809.00 → 810.00] This is obviously fine, right?
[810.00 → 811.00] Like, no big deal.
[811.00 → 812.00] I'm just walking through, no big deal.
[812.00 → 813.00] No one stopped me, which is great.
[813.00 → 814.00] Okay.
[814.00 → 815.00] So I walked through the security gate.
[815.00 → 817.00] There are three huge arenas.
[817.00 → 822.00] And two of them are super, super loud and have tons of cars out of them and are just absolutely massive.
[822.00 → 825.00] And I'm like, I think Star Craft is a little bit smaller than that.
[825.00 → 828.00] Those ended up both being huge baseball games going on at the same time.
[828.00 → 829.00] Okay.
[829.00 → 831.00] And then, so I walked through, go to the one in the very back.
[831.00 → 834.00] So Star Craft isn't quite baseball yet, is what you're trying to say.
[834.00 → 835.00] No, not quite.
[835.00 → 836.00] Gotcha.
[836.00 → 837.00] They're trying though.
[837.00 → 838.00] We go to the back.
[838.00 → 839.00] Admittance was free.
[839.00 → 840.00] Cool.
[840.00 → 843.00] It was a 10 buck deposit that I got back, or 10,000 won.
[843.00 → 844.00] Right.
[844.00 → 848.00] To get a like, little radio thing.
[848.00 → 849.00] Sure.
[849.00 → 851.00] That I wore headphones for that I could get tuned in to the English casters.
[851.00 → 852.00] Right.
[852.00 → 853.00] Because there were the Korean casters.
[853.00 → 856.00] Which honestly, after a while I just took it out because it was kind of cool to listen
[856.00 → 858.00] to the crazy Korean casters.
[858.00 → 859.00] Right.
[859.00 → 860.00] They're nuts.
[860.00 → 862.00] Because I can kind of see what's going on.
[862.00 → 869.00] It's kind of like Badminton, where there's some of the coverage on the Canadian feed had
[869.00 → 870.00] a bad commendation.
[870.00 → 872.00] But it was, like, terrible.
[872.00 → 873.00] Right, right.
[873.00 → 877.00] Whereas I'd rather, honestly, I'd rather listen to it in, like, Danish.
[878.00 → 881.00] Because at least the guys know when to be excited.
[881.00 → 885.00] And, like, the guys who don't really know the sport very well, they'd get, like, super
[885.00 → 886.00] excited about some shot.
[886.00 → 888.00] And I'm like, I can make that shot.
[888.00 → 892.00] Whereas, like, the actual guys who actually know how to play the game, or knew how to play
[892.00 → 893.00] it at some point.
[893.00 → 894.00] They, yeah.
[894.00 → 895.00] Anyway, so yeah.
[895.00 → 896.00] Well, like, okay.
[896.00 → 898.00] Those Star Craft casters were actually good, the English ones.
[898.00 → 899.00] Right.
[899.00 → 901.00] So it's not, I understand that analogy, and I agree, but it didn't really apply.
[901.00 → 902.00] Because they were actually good.
[902.00 → 903.00] Okay, not quite like that, then.
[903.00 → 904.00] Okay.
[904.00 → 906.00] But it was just entertaining to listen to the Korean guys live.
[906.00 → 907.00] Right.
[907.00 → 908.00] Because they're so crazy, right?
[908.00 → 909.00] So it was just kind of cool.
[909.00 → 911.00] And to, like, feel the vibe of the crowd.
[911.00 → 914.00] Because everyone was just way more amped than I've ever seen.
[914.00 → 917.00] Because the only thing I've gone to around here is Warcraft.
[917.00 → 920.00] Which is where people go to a bar, and then all the TVs have Star Craft on them.
[920.00 → 921.00] Right.
[921.00 → 924.00] And that's interesting, but no one's really rowdy.
[924.00 → 925.00] Right.
[925.00 → 926.00] Everyone's crazy in the rain.
[926.00 → 927.00] So that was kind of cool.
[927.00 → 930.00] End up trying to leave there and figure out how the heck I'm supposed to get back to that
[930.00 → 931.00] dorm.
[931.00 → 932.00] Right.
[932.00 → 933.00] Because that's where my luggage is.
[933.00 → 934.00] Right.
[934.00 → 939.00] So, jump on the train, hope I'm going in the right direction, get off at some random
[939.00 → 940.00] stop, figure it out.
[940.00 → 941.00] Ended up getting there.
[941.00 → 942.00] Okay, cool.
[942.00 → 943.00] It actually wasn't that bad.
[943.00 → 944.00] The toll is actually really easy to navigate around.
[944.00 → 945.00] Okay.
[945.00 → 950.00] Because the train system is, like, super intricate, but if you at least know what stop you're
[950.00 → 952.00] supposed to get off on, it can kind of lean you there.
[952.00 → 953.00] Okay, cool.
[953.00 → 954.00] It's not really that big of a deal.
[954.00 → 956.00] Got there eventually, hung out with them for a while.
[956.00 → 961.00] Okay, now this is Sunday, Diesel should be in town.
[961.00 → 965.00] I need to get up to the hotel so I can meet up with him.
[965.00 → 966.00] Right.
[966.00 → 972.00] So, I go around the subway, or yeah, subway really, really quickly, get up there, try
[972.00 → 974.00] and get a cab to Ramadan, where we were staying.
[974.00 → 975.00] Mm-hmm.
[975.00 → 976.00] Took me to Grand Hyatt.
[976.00 → 977.00] Oh, okay.
[977.00 → 978.00] Which is way across town.
[978.00 → 983.00] And then I had to try and get all the way back, eventually made it, that was ridiculous.
[983.00 → 987.00] And then the actual Korea trip started, which was fairly, not very eventful.
[987.00 → 991.00] Except for a changing of the guard ceremony that Diesel and I participated in, which I'll
[991.00 → 992.00] try and get pictures for you.
[992.00 → 995.00] We acted as commanders in the changing of the guard ceremony.
[995.00 → 997.00] It was epic.
[997.00 → 998.00] What?
[998.00 → 999.00] Yeah.
[999.00 → 1004.00] I was Googling out stuff to do in Korea, and they're like, changing the guard ceremony.
[1004.00 → 1006.00] They only do like one person a day, it's like this big thing.
[1006.00 → 1007.00] So I was like, let's do it!
[1007.00 → 1010.00] So I talked to Proxy, and I was like, can we do this?
[1010.00 → 1012.00] So he hooked it all up, and we ended up going.
[1012.00 → 1013.00] No way!
[1013.00 → 1017.00] Put us in full costume with like a real sword and a real bow and arrow and everything.
[1017.00 → 1020.00] And then we like marched out with everyone and had to go through this like cryptic process
[1020.00 → 1022.00] to make sure we were the same people.
[1022.00 → 1025.00] And you like put coins together and make sure they match and check for a key and do all
[1025.00 → 1026.00] this stuff.
[1026.00 → 1027.00] It's crazy!
[1027.00 → 1030.00] And we were in front of all these people that were watching, and it was nuts.
[1030.00 → 1031.00] Wow, that's really cool.
[1031.00 → 1032.00] It was pretty cool.
[1032.00 → 1034.00] Other than that, it was just like shopping.
[1034.00 → 1035.00] Alright!
[1035.00 → 1038.00] So, let's talk Xbox One!
[1038.00 → 1039.00] So this is...
[1039.00 → 1041.00] Xbox One 80!
[1041.00 → 1042.00] Xbox, yeah!
[1042.00 → 1043.00] Xbox One 80!
[1043.00 → 1045.00] Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[1045.00 → 1048.00] So this is from IGN from a couple of days ago.
[1048.00 → 1052.00] You guys have probably heard about this but what you haven't heard is any of Slick's take
[1052.00 → 1057.00] on the whole next gen console Xbox One thing beyond some of the early news that was coming
[1057.00 → 1058.00] out.
[1058.00 → 1061.00] So I'll run you through, quickly through the details of this one.
[1061.00 → 1066.00] So contrary to everything Microsoft has set up till now, they are completely turning around
[1066.00 → 1071.00] on everything so it no longer requires an internet connection to play offline games.
[1071.00 → 1073.00] No longer needs to check in 24 hours a day.
[1073.00 → 1078.00] Now allows game discs to be traded in much the same way that they used to.
[1078.00 → 1085.00] So disc based games operate the way they used to, whereas games that are based around downloads
[1085.00 → 1090.00] will operate according to your account from what I've seen in here.
[1090.00 → 1091.00] What else we got here?
[1091.00 → 1096.00] No restrictions on trade-ins, no region locked consoles.
[1096.00 → 1100.00] Honestly, that was the one where I was just like, is this April Fools?
[1100.00 → 1104.00] You're going to launch a console in like 21, 22 countries, whatever it was?
[1104.00 → 1105.00] I mean that was ridiculous.
[1105.00 → 1106.00] Did you even see that one?
[1106.00 → 1107.00] Yeah, yeah.
[1107.00 → 1108.00] What?
[1108.00 → 1110.00] And it was like a bunch of Asian countries it wasn't being released in?
[1110.00 → 1111.00] Yeah.
[1111.00 → 1112.00] Are you crazy?
[1112.00 → 1114.00] It's like, oh yeah, we don't need to release in China or India.
[1114.00 → 1115.00] Yeah.
[1115.00 → 1117.00] Because China and India don't play video games.
[1117.00 → 1118.00] What?
[1118.00 → 1119.00] Are you nuts?
[1119.00 → 1121.00] Anyway, and I think Japan wasn't even on the list.
[1121.00 → 1123.00] There were a few ones that made me kind of...
[1123.00 → 1126.00] Yeah, honestly, like it looked like they were joking at that point.
[1126.00 → 1130.00] In addition to being available in retail stores, Xbox One games will still be available
[1130.00 → 1133.00] to download on day one and will be playable on any Xbox One console.
[1133.00 → 1136.00] So that sounds like it's account based.
[1136.00 → 1141.00] So here, this is the part that is really most notable to me.
[1141.00 → 1150.00] Since unveiling our plans for Xbox One, my team and I have heard directly from many of you, read your comments and listened to your feedback.
[1150.00 → 1155.00] I would like to take the opportunity today to thank you for our assistance in helping us reshape the future of Xbox One.
[1155.00 → 1159.00] You told us how much you love the flexibility you have today with games delivered on disc.
[1159.00 → 1163.00] The ability to lend, share and resell these games at your discretion is of incredible importance to you.
[1163.00 → 1167.00] Also important is the freedom to play offline for any length of time anywhere in the world.
[1167.00 → 1170.00] I'll let you go first.
[1170.00 → 1176.00] Basically, what I think happened was they were second on Amazon pre-order sales.
[1176.00 → 1180.00] And they were like, oh no, how do we take that first spot?
[1180.00 → 1181.00] Huh.
[1181.00 → 1183.00] I'm not really sure.
[1183.00 → 1185.00] What does everyone like more about the other cons?
[1185.00 → 1186.00] Oh, okay.
[1186.00 → 1190.00] I guess we should maybe change a few things so we can get that top dollar spot.
[1190.00 → 1192.00] I think that's what happened.
[1192.00 → 1196.00] Because that's the only thing, okay, the company's going to change something so they can make more money.
[1196.00 → 1197.00] Okay.
[1197.00 → 1198.00] It's a company.
[1198.00 → 1199.00] You're supposed to try and make more money.
[1199.00 → 1201.00] That's the whole idea of a company.
[1201.00 → 1205.00] So while I don't necessarily think the idea of making more money is evil or bad.
[1205.00 → 1206.00] Nope.
[1206.00 → 1207.00] Linus Media Group needs to make money.
[1207.00 → 1208.00] We need to make more money.
[1208.00 → 1209.00] Just throwing that out there.
[1209.00 → 1211.00] And we will do things that help us make more money.
[1211.00 → 1212.00] Yes.
[1212.00 → 1215.00] I like to think we don't bone our viewers over it.
[1215.00 → 1219.00] Yeah, I was just going to say, they went way too far.
[1219.00 → 1222.00] Like orders of magnitude way too far.
[1222.00 → 1224.00] And then reeled it all the way back.
[1224.00 → 1225.00] Which was a good move.
[1225.00 → 1226.00] I don't know if it's too little too late.
[1226.00 → 1228.00] I don't know if everyone's too angry already.
[1228.00 → 1232.00] Did you hear about the like mass returns of Xbox 360 stuff?
[1232.00 → 1233.00] No.
[1233.00 → 1234.00] Trade in stuff?
[1234.00 → 1236.00] People were trading in everything they had.
[1236.00 → 1237.00] Really?
[1237.00 → 1239.00] Just like, here's my console, here's all my games.
[1239.00 → 1242.00] At like stupid low trade in prices because everyone is doing it.
[1242.00 → 1245.00] So now's a good time to get an Xbox 360 on the cheap.
[1245.00 → 1246.00] Probably.
[1246.00 → 1247.00] Cool.
[1247.00 → 1248.00] I would assume.
[1248.00 → 1249.00] If we wanted to play Xbox 360.
[1249.00 → 1253.00] You know, I had a lot of people criticizing me last week for talking consoles at all.
[1253.00 → 1257.00] Because I said outright the last console game I bought was Mario Kart Wii.
[1257.00 → 1260.00] And then the one before that was probably on this NEW.
[1260.00 → 1264.00] And people were like, well if you don't buy it then you don't have the right to talk about it.
[1264.00 → 1267.00] And I was just kind of like, well...
[1267.00 → 1268.00] Okay.
[1268.00 → 1270.00] You know, duly noted.
[1270.00 → 1276.00] But I don't think playing Gears of War makes me more qualified to talk about an Xbox.
[1276.00 → 1278.00] I think it could help.
[1278.00 → 1280.00] Do you think it could help if I played Gears of War?
[1280.00 → 1281.00] I think it could help.
[1281.00 → 1284.00] Because then you're more in tuned, you know like...
[1284.00 → 1286.00] You're more in tuned with the whole system.
[1286.00 → 1287.00] Mm hmm.
[1287.00 → 1288.00] If you...
[1288.00 → 1289.00] If you...
[1289.00 → 1291.00] Not necessarily the act of purchasing a game.
[1291.00 → 1294.00] But if you actually play on the console you probably have more to say about it.
[1294.00 → 1295.00] Okay.
[1295.00 → 1296.00] That much is true.
[1296.00 → 1298.00] You probably already have a minimum amount to say about it.
[1298.00 → 1299.00] Sure.
[1299.00 → 1301.00] I don't think that's invalid because you don't play on it.
[1301.00 → 1303.00] But I think you could have more to say about it.
[1303.00 → 1307.00] Well they said they wanted to hear from you more because you are an actual gamer.
[1307.00 → 1310.00] So that's why I'm kind of letting you go first here on this one.
[1310.00 → 1311.00] Okay.
[1311.00 → 1314.00] Even though it should be noted, when was the last time you played a game on an Xbox?
[1314.00 → 1315.00] An Xbox?
[1315.00 → 1317.00] Or an Xbox 360.
[1317.00 → 1318.00] Mine broke.
[1318.00 → 1319.00] Yours broke.
[1319.00 → 1320.00] How many times did yours break?
[1320.00 → 1322.00] Four...
[1322.00 → 1323.00] I think.
[1323.00 → 1326.00] I have three on my shelf that are all dead.
[1326.00 → 1328.00] But I think one of them was exchanged for warranty.
[1328.00 → 1329.00] Okay.
[1329.00 → 1331.00] So I think it was four.
[1331.00 → 1333.00] But I currently have three broken ones on a shelf.
[1333.00 → 1334.00] Okay.
[1334.00 → 1335.00] And you don't have a working one?
[1335.00 → 1336.00] No.
[1336.00 → 1337.00] And one of them like...
[1337.00 → 1341.00] So out of the two of us, I'm the only one with a working Xbox 360.
[1341.00 → 1342.00] But I played a lot.
[1342.00 → 1343.00] Okay.
[1343.00 → 1344.00] I played on Xbox 360.
[1344.00 → 1345.00] So there you go guys.
[1345.00 → 1348.00] That's why Slick will do most of our console talk.
[1348.00 → 1350.00] My brother and I took...
[1350.00 → 1351.00] One of them had a dead optical drive.
[1351.00 → 1353.00] The other one had a dead motherboard.
[1353.00 → 1354.00] So we zombie two of them together.
[1354.00 → 1355.00] Right.
[1355.00 → 1358.00] We were riding on that for a little while and then that one kind of died.
[1358.00 → 1359.00] Right.
[1359.00 → 1360.00] Just like...
[1360.00 → 1361.00] Man.
[1361.00 → 1362.00] Okay.
[1362.00 → 1365.00] So here's my take whether you guys think I should be allowed to talk about it or not.
[1365.00 → 1366.00] And I mean, okay.
[1366.00 → 1371.00] Maybe I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt much the same way we've done to EA before.
[1371.00 → 1372.00] And as much as it hurts me...
[1372.00 → 1373.00] I mean, I love Microsoft.
[1373.00 → 1375.00] I love so many of the things they do.
[1375.00 → 1378.00] As much as it hurts me to utter their name under the... in the same breath as EA.
[1378.00 → 1379.00] Yeah.
[1379.00 → 1385.00] It almost feels like what they've done here is intentionally be as terrible as they possibly
[1385.00 → 1395.00] can for all the press and all the talk and all the buzz so that they can have as much impact as possible when they reverse all of it.
[1395.00 → 1399.00] Because if they were really trying to get away with all this stuff, did they have to go...
[1399.00 → 1401.00] You trickle it out.
[1401.00 → 1402.00] Yeah.
[1402.00 → 1404.00] Did they have to go full stop?
[1404.00 → 1405.00] No.
[1405.00 → 1406.00] We're going to go...
[1406.00 → 1408.00] As people have said, this is the Xbox 180.
[1408.00 → 1412.00] Do we need to do a full reversal of absolutely everything?
[1412.00 → 1413.00] Why?
[1413.00 → 1416.00] Why couldn't they still do account based games?
[1416.00 → 1420.00] I actually don't understand why you can't have an account based game.
[1420.00 → 1421.00] I...
[1421.00 → 1422.00] And like...
[1422.00 → 1423.00] Like...
[1423.00 → 1424.00] There's a lot to say on that.
[1424.00 → 1425.00] Okay, there's a lot to say on that.
[1425.00 → 1427.00] I mean, why can't it work something like Steam though?
[1427.00 → 1429.00] That's an account based gaming system.
[1429.00 → 1430.00] Yeah.
[1430.00 → 1432.00] You sign in...
[1432.00 → 1433.00] And then...
[1433.00 → 1434.00] I'm going to keep doing this.
[1434.00 → 1435.00] Look at...
[1435.00 → 1436.00] He looks like he's going to explode.
[1436.00 → 1442.00] So you sign in, and then once you've signed it, so you boot up and sign in, then it's validated
[1442.00 → 1443.00] for a while.
[1443.00 → 1445.00] I actually don't have a problem with that.
[1445.00 → 1446.00] It's never bothered me.
[1446.00 → 1449.00] I've never been offline long enough that it's bothered me.
[1449.00 → 1451.00] I've had my computer offline for insane amounts of time.
[1451.00 → 1453.00] How long is the time frame?
[1453.00 → 1454.00] For Steam?
[1454.00 → 1455.00] Yeah.
[1455.00 → 1456.00] It's...
[1456.00 → 1457.00] I think it's at least a week.
[1457.00 → 1458.00] I...
[1458.00 → 1459.00] Or like five days or three days or something.
[1459.00 → 1460.00] Like it's multiple days.
[1460.00 → 1461.00] I'd be surprised if it was that short.
[1461.00 → 1462.00] It might vary by...
[1462.00 → 1464.00] I think it's pretty freaking long.
[1464.00 → 1465.00] So...
[1465.00 → 1467.00] So if they'd implemented something like that...
[1467.00 → 1470.00] And like another thing though, with Steam, um...
[1470.00 → 1473.00] With their new leaked code thing.
[1473.00 → 1474.00] Oh, yeah.
[1474.00 → 1475.00] No, no, we'll talk about that later.
[1475.00 → 1476.00] Okay, okay.
[1476.00 → 1477.00] But...
[1477.00 → 1478.00] Well, that ties in so well.
[1478.00 → 1479.00] Uh, okay, fine.
[1479.00 → 1480.00] We'll talk about that now, so...
[1480.00 → 1481.00] Okay, okay, okay.
[1481.00 → 1484.00] So there are a few lines of code that came out in a new beta patch.
[1484.00 → 1485.00] Yeah.
[1485.00 → 1491.00] Um, which basically stated in the lines of code, shared game, borrowed game, lending game.
[1491.00 → 1492.00] Apparently it's two weeks.
[1492.00 → 1493.00] This kind of key phrases.
[1493.00 → 1494.00] Two weeks?
[1494.00 → 1495.00] Someone says more than two weeks.
[1495.00 → 1496.00] Either way, it's a long time.
[1496.00 → 1497.00] Go ahead.
[1497.00 → 1498.00] Yeah.
[1498.00 → 1503.00] Um, which basically means there's a high possibility that you are going to be able to lend, share,
[1503.00 → 1505.00] borrow games through Steam.
[1505.00 → 1506.00] So people would be able to...
[1506.00 → 1507.00] That's going to be so cool.
[1507.00 → 1508.00] So cool.
[1508.00 → 1509.00] Yeah.
[1509.00 → 1513.00] So you would be able to, like, I guess temporarily remove your ability to play it from your library
[1513.00 → 1518.00] and allow your friend to play it, which is the exact same thing as taking a disc from
[1518.00 → 1521.00] your house, giving it to your friend, and not being able to play it for a little while.
[1521.00 → 1522.00] Except your friend could live in, like, Sweden.
[1522.00 → 1523.00] Yeah.
[1523.00 → 1524.00] Ah, so cool.
[1524.00 → 1525.00] Which is awesome.
[1525.00 → 1526.00] Yes.
[1526.00 → 1527.00] Like, that's really, really cool.
[1527.00 → 1529.00] Again, uh, one of our mods just said 90 days.
[1529.00 → 1530.00] That sounds more right to me.
[1530.00 → 1531.00] That sounds...
[1531.00 → 1532.00] That sounds too much.
[1532.00 → 1535.00] I've, like, I was pretty sure it's really long.
[1535.00 → 1536.00] Okay.
[1536.00 → 1538.00] Because I've, I've had it be really long before.
[1538.00 → 1539.00] I don't know if that's right or not.
[1539.00 → 1544.00] Anyway, I mean, I think the I think the, the protection from someone like Valve is, well,
[1544.00 → 1547.00] you don't let people log into your Steam account because then you're boned.
[1547.00 → 1548.00] Yeah.
[1548.00 → 1551.00] I mean, and I don't mind that as far as protection goes.
[1551.00 → 1555.00] I mean, use Two-Step because they do use Two-Step when you log in from an unfamiliar place.
[1555.00 → 1556.00] And I love their Two-Step.
[1556.00 → 1557.00] And their Two-Step is great.
[1557.00 → 1558.00] Yeah.
[1558.00 → 1562.00] Like, if Microsoft were to implement it exactly that way, you would not lend your Xbox account
[1562.00 → 1563.00] to someone.
[1563.00 → 1565.00] Like, you just wouldn't.
[1565.00 → 1566.00] So...
[1566.00 → 1567.00] But they should allow the sharing thing.
[1567.00 → 1569.00] But they should allow the sharing thing.
[1569.00 → 1574.00] So, anyway, like, do you think it's just that no press is bad press, and it was, like,
[1574.00 → 1575.00] a strategy?
[1575.00 → 1576.00] I don't think so.
[1576.00 → 1577.00] Or is that just too insane?
[1577.00 → 1578.00] I think it's too insane.
[1578.00 → 1579.00] I think it's too insane.
[1579.00 → 1581.00] Is that any less insane than if they actually did that?
[1581.00 → 1582.00] Than if they actually went ahead with...
[1582.00 → 1583.00] They're pretty close, but...
[1583.00 → 1585.00] Like, what's more insane?
[1585.00 → 1587.00] They developed all these systems.
[1587.00 → 1588.00] I think they were going to try.
[1588.00 → 1590.00] I think they didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal.
[1590.00 → 1592.00] How could they possibly think that?
[1592.00 → 1594.00] Because Xbox is huge.
[1594.00 → 1597.00] So is PlayStation!
[1597.00 → 1598.00] Yeah.
[1598.00 → 1600.00] They have a competitor!
[1600.00 → 1601.00] But...
[1601.00 → 1602.00] Whoop!
[1602.00 → 1604.00] Don't worry about it.
[1604.00 → 1608.00] But at the same time, a lot of people were expecting PlayStation to be at a much higher
[1608.00 → 1609.00] price point.
[1609.00 → 1612.00] And I wonder if Microsoft thought the same thing.
[1612.00 → 1614.00] But even at an equal price point...
[1614.00 → 1615.00] Like...
[1615.00 → 1616.00] PlayStation's cheaper.
[1616.00 → 1617.00] And it's cheaper!
[1617.00 → 1618.00] By a significant amount.
[1618.00 → 1619.00] But a lot of...
[1619.00 → 1620.00] Like...
[1620.00 → 1622.00] PlayStation 3 came out at a huge price point.
[1622.00 → 1623.00] Yeah, that's true.
[1623.00 → 1625.00] So if Microsoft was expecting a similar idea...
[1625.00 → 1627.00] Which they shouldn't have...
[1627.00 → 1631.00] Everyone already knew that both Microsoft and Sony were going to be using pretty much the
[1631.00 → 1632.00] same friggin' hardware.
[1632.00 → 1633.00] Yep.
[1633.00 → 1638.00] Except Sony doesn't have a like, grand scale webcam that comes with it.
[1638.00 → 1639.00] Which people don't want.
[1639.00 → 1640.00] Which people don't want.
[1640.00 → 1641.00] Which people...
[1641.00 → 1642.00] Well, I would probably use it.
[1642.00 → 1644.00] A lot of people don't want.
[1644.00 → 1645.00] Okay.
[1645.00 → 1646.00] Many people don't want.
[1646.00 → 1647.00] But I think...
[1647.00 → 1649.00] I think a lot of the mainstream folks who are not Reddit junkies...
[1649.00 → 1653.00] Yeah, but it's not just Reddit junkies that are scared of the constant surveillance.
[1653.00 → 1654.00] That's true.
[1654.00 → 1655.00] That's true.
[1655.00 → 1658.00] But they've also come out and said a few things about the constant surveillance.
[1658.00 → 1663.00] I mean, having it listening for microphone commands is a little bit different from having
[1663.00 → 1665.00] it recording every conversation and then...
[1665.00 → 1668.00] But then all the same time, all that stuff going on with Prism and everything, you don't
[1668.00 → 1669.00] really know what's happening.
[1669.00 → 1670.00] That's true.
[1670.00 → 1672.00] And I'm like, I don't want to get way into that.
[1672.00 → 1675.00] And we're not saying Microsoft is in any way involved in Prism.
[1675.00 → 1677.00] Just that thing exists.
[1677.00 → 1678.00] Yes.
[1678.00 → 1679.00] And they're a company that has data.
[1679.00 → 1681.00] And, and, and, and, and, and.
[1681.00 → 1682.00] And whatever.
[1682.00 → 1683.00] Um...
[1683.00 → 1685.00] Figure that out on your own, I guess.
[1685.00 → 1686.00] Um...
[1686.00 → 1689.00] But yeah, I'm not way too into that.
[1689.00 → 1690.00] Yeah, okay.
[1690.00 → 1691.00] Alright.
[1691.00 → 1692.00] I don't know.
[1692.00 → 1698.00] So, anyway, yeah, Valve, uh, allowing lending of games potentially at some point.
[1698.00 → 1699.00] That's going to be super cool.
[1699.00 → 1700.00] That's awesome.
[1700.00 → 1704.00] Like, okay, now, I don't think they're going to have the, uh, bring in a friend thing
[1704.00 → 1707.00] that you used to be able to do basically with like Warcraft 3 and stuff.
[1707.00 → 1708.00] Where if you're landing...
[1708.00 → 1709.00] Oh, like spawn install?
[1709.00 → 1710.00] Spawn install, yeah.
[1710.00 → 1711.00] That'd be cool.
[1711.00 → 1712.00] I don't think they're going to be though.
[1712.00 → 1713.00] I doubt it.
[1713.00 → 1714.00] Because that would be way too...
[1714.00 → 1716.00] You'd have to, that would be a licensed, that would be a licensed thing that I'd have
[1716.00 → 1718.00] to figure out on a game by game basis.
[1718.00 → 1719.00] Yeah.
[1719.00 → 1720.00] That would be awesome.
[1720.00 → 1721.00] Like, okay, nothing about this.
[1721.00 → 1723.00] I just randomly brought this up.
[1723.00 → 1724.00] That would be cool though.
[1724.00 → 1727.00] And maybe if you can do it with every person like twice, maybe.
[1727.00 → 1728.00] Right.
[1728.00 → 1729.00] Like, that would be pretty cool.
[1729.00 → 1730.00] Uh...
[1731.00 → 1732.00] Sure.
[1732.00 → 1734.00] That would be pretty cool.
[1734.00 → 1735.00] Just so the person can try out the game.
[1735.00 → 1738.00] Because there are a lot of games I'll talk to my friends about and be like, you've got
[1738.00 → 1739.00] to get this game.
[1739.00 → 1740.00] Yeah.
[1740.00 → 1741.00] It's pretty cheap.
[1741.00 → 1742.00] You should buy it.
[1742.00 → 1743.00] You could lend someone...
[1743.00 → 1748.00] I wonder if the lending will be like a long term lending or if they'll only allow like
[1748.00 → 1749.00] short period lending.
[1749.00 → 1750.00] I mean, it's possible they're just...
[1750.00 → 1754.00] I mean, you look at sort of when Valve announces or starts talking about something, or you catch
[1754.00 → 1755.00] wind of something.
[1755.00 → 1756.00] It might happen in three years.
[1756.00 → 1757.00] Yeah.
[1757.00 → 1758.00] Five years.
[1758.00 → 1759.00] They might still be working on implementation.
[1759.00 → 1762.00] They might have put it in there just to kind of use it internally.
[1762.00 → 1763.00] Maybe they only...
[1763.00 → 1765.00] Maybe they created the tool just for themselves.
[1765.00 → 1767.00] You never know.
[1767.00 → 1768.00] That would be pretty cool.
[1768.00 → 1769.00] Yeah.
[1769.00 → 1770.00] I'm sure they're going to be like that.
[1770.00 → 1772.00] This is all speculation and I really hope it happens.
[1772.00 → 1773.00] Yeah.
[1773.00 → 1774.00] I don't know.
[1774.00 → 1775.00] But I guess we'll find out.
[1775.00 → 1778.00] It's just a few lines of code that a few people found in their new build.
[1778.00 → 1779.00] Right.
[1779.00 → 1780.00] So, it could mean realistically anything.
[1780.00 → 1781.00] Okay.
[1781.00 → 1782.00] So, topic...
[1782.00 → 1783.00] You know what?
[1783.00 → 1785.00] Let's do a Twitter Q&A blitz.
[1785.00 → 1787.00] So, here we go guys.
[1787.00 → 1789.00] Hit us on Twitter.
[1789.00 → 1794.00] Did you hear about the new rumours for Half-Life 3 and I think he means...
[1794.00 → 1795.00] Wait.
[1795.00 → 1796.00] What?
[1796.00 → 1797.00] Source 2?
[1797.00 → 1798.00] Oh, Source 2 Engine.
[1798.00 → 1800.00] I heard it was Half-Life 3 and something else 3.
[1800.00 → 1803.00] Half-Life 3 is on Steam but not for sale.
[1803.00 → 1804.00] Someone just told me.
[1804.00 → 1805.00] What?
[1805.00 → 1806.00] Anyway.
[1806.00 → 1807.00] Have you heard about this?
[1807.00 → 1811.00] I heard that there was a rumour and hold on.
[1811.00 → 1812.00] Holy cow.
[1812.00 → 1814.00] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1814.00 → 1815.00] That's a prank.
[1815.00 → 1816.00] Look at the URL.
[1816.00 → 1818.00] Someone sent it to me too.
[1818.00 → 1819.00] I was like, come on man.
[1819.00 → 1820.00] Aww, Stern Powers.
[1820.00 → 1823.00] Yeah, it's D-E-A-R-N-M or something.
[1823.00 → 1825.00] And you can tell because the picture's all...
[1825.00 → 1827.00] Yeah, no, no, no, no, ignore that.
[1827.00 → 1830.00] There was a rumour though that Half-Life 3 will be coming at some point.
[1830.00 → 1832.00] Someone says, new Star Citizen video.
[1832.00 → 1833.00] Okay, I'll check it out.
[1833.00 → 1834.00] That's cool, yeah.
[1834.00 → 1835.00] Are tablets worth it?
[1835.00 → 1837.00] That totally depends on your use case.
[1837.00 → 1838.00] Subjective.
[1838.00 → 1839.00] Go.
[1839.00 → 1840.00] Subjective.
[1840.00 → 1841.00] So, if...
[1841.00 → 1842.00] Well, it's subjective.
[1842.00 → 1843.00] Yeah, so go.
[1843.00 → 1844.00] What's your subjective?
[1844.00 → 1847.00] Like, if you're someone who wants to hang out on the couch, watch TV a lot, and be able
[1847.00 → 1850.00] to do emails and stuff while you're on the couch, I think that's awesome.
[1850.00 → 1855.00] If you basically need a laptop, I wouldn't suggest buying a tablet as a laptop replacement.
[1855.00 → 1856.00] I would actually just buy a laptop.
[1856.00 → 1859.00] The only time I ever really use my tablet is to watch videos in the bath.
[1859.00 → 1860.00] So, that's a good.
[1860.00 → 1861.00] Yeah.
[1861.00 → 1866.00] Honestly, I see tablets less as a super portable thing, or more as something to carry around the house.
[1866.00 → 1867.00] Or as like, instead of a notepad.
[1867.00 → 1871.00] Like, sometimes I'll set up a tablet on a stand so that I can refer to it during an unboxing.
[1871.00 → 1872.00] Definitely.
[1872.00 → 1875.00] Hey Linus at Computer, did you see the refresher on the 600T?
[1875.00 → 1876.00] I did not, unfortunately.
[1876.00 → 1881.00] My friend bought a Mac Pro for $3,800 and uses it for only Facebook.
[1881.00 → 1883.00] He says Mac is better than PC.
[1883.00 → 1884.00] How hard should I smack him?
[1884.00 → 1888.00] There's no point smacking him because negative reinforcement is not how they learn.
[1888.00 → 1890.00] Positive reinforcement, man.
[1890.00 → 1893.00] Did you sign the petition for Tom Clancy's The Division?
[1893.00 → 1894.00] I did.
[1894.00 → 1895.00] Did you?
[1895.00 → 1896.00] Why?
[1896.00 → 1897.00] Because I want to play Tom Clancy's The Division on PC.
[1897.00 → 1898.00] Okay, cool.
[1898.00 → 1901.00] The petition is to bring Tom Clancy's Division to PC.
[1901.00 → 1902.00] Alright.
[1902.00 → 1905.00] And Ubisoft is pushing it.
[1905.00 → 1907.00] They're like, yeah, yeah, sign it, sign it.
[1907.00 → 1911.00] Do you think Microsoft would do something like releasing a system that's around $400 before Christmas?
[1911.00 → 1915.00] It depends on how hard people don't buy the Xbox One that comes with Kine ct.
[1915.00 → 1919.00] Saw a Vizio 14-inch Ultrabook on the background of your keyboard unboxing.
[1919.00 → 1920.00] Review soon.
[1920.00 → 1921.00] Yes.
[1921.00 → 1926.00] Also, we're going to be doing like a cool lifestyle-y type video that features that particular notebook.
[1926.00 → 1927.00] It isn't an Ultrabook though.
[1927.00 → 1932.00] It's actually a 15-inch, and it's like a super slim touch screen notebook with a quad-core.
[1932.00 → 1934.00] Someone says check this out with no link.
[1936.00 → 1938.00] Half-Life 3 on Steam, not for sale.
[1938.00 → 1939.00] No, it isn't.
[1939.00 → 1941.00] Will there be changes to the Computer giveaways?
[1941.00 → 1943.00] Potentially, but no promises yet.
[1943.00 → 1944.00] So stay tuned for that.
[1944.00 → 1950.00] Will there be any hard drive cage add-ons for the card by 540, possibly to the back, or have to mod it?
[1950.00 → 1954.00] I believe I said in the video that you can add more.
[1954.00 → 1955.00] No, maybe not.
[1955.00 → 1956.00] I don't know.
[1956.00 → 1958.00] So don't quote me on that.
[1958.00 → 1962.00] What do you think of having a code in disk-based games that lets it be account bound if you want?
[1962.00 → 1963.00] You're on.
[1963.00 → 1965.00] Is that not how a lot of them work?
[1965.00 → 1969.00] I think disk-based games are disk-based games according to the article that we had up from IBM.
[1969.00 → 1970.00] For Xbox?
[1970.00 → 1971.00] For Xbox.
[1971.00 → 1973.00] Okay, I didn't realize that was...
[1973.00 → 1974.00] I think he's talking Xbox.
[1974.00 → 1976.00] I snapped to, like, PC stuff right there.
[1976.00 → 1977.00] Sure.
[1977.00 → 1978.00] Um, I don't know.
[1978.00 → 1979.00] If you...
[1979.00 → 1981.00] Options are good, in my opinion.
[1981.00 → 1982.00] Okay.
[1982.00 → 1984.00] If you want it to be account bound, that would be cool.
[1984.00 → 1987.00] But having the option to not apply that code would also be cool.
[1987.00 → 1992.00] According to this post by Valve Employ, offline mode is intended to be basically indefinite now.
[1992.00 → 1993.00] Very cool.
[1993.00 → 1995.00] So you guys can click on that one if you want to check that out.
[1995.00 → 1996.00] Awesome.
[1996.00 → 1997.00] Watching live in the UK.
[1997.00 → 1998.00] Determined to watch all the way through.
[1998.00 → 1999.00] Thanks, man.
[1999.00 → 2000.00] Hello.
[2000.00 → 2003.00] You can buy games from Steam from different retailers, which means discounts.
[2003.00 → 2006.00] You can only buy digital games for Xbox from MS.
[2006.00 → 2009.00] What games for Steam can you buy from different re...
[2009.00 → 2012.00] Okay, yeah, like if it comes with a Steam code in a box.
[2012.00 → 2013.00] Well, no, there's stuff like Humble Bundle.
[2013.00 → 2014.00] Yeah, okay.
[2014.00 → 2016.00] And there are other places that you can get Steam codes for games.
[2016.00 → 2017.00] I think that might be what he means.
[2017.00 → 2018.00] This is true.
[2018.00 → 2019.00] I'm not really sure.
[2019.00 → 2020.00] I mean, I've found...
[2020.00 → 2021.00] It's, uh...
[2021.00 → 2024.00] A lot of the time, Steam's cheaper anyway.
[2024.00 → 2025.00] Yeah, to be honest, they've insane sales.
[2025.00 → 2028.00] Speaking of which, Summer Sale must be coming fairly soon.
[2028.00 → 2029.00] Oh, yeah, Summer Sale.
[2029.00 → 2034.00] The first year they did Summer Sale, I probably spent like a couple of hundred bucks on just a
[2034.00 → 2036.00] bunch of games that I've like never played.
[2036.00 → 2037.00] Never played.
[2037.00 → 2038.00] Yeah, so...
[2038.00 → 2039.00] It's brutal, but the problem is I'll do it again, which is just...
[2039.00 → 2040.00] Oh, I know, right?
[2040.00 → 2041.00] Oh.
[2041.00 → 2042.00] It's kind of ridiculous.
[2042.00 → 2045.00] And like I understand it doesn't make any sense, because I still haven't played a lot
[2045.00 → 2047.00] of games from the last Summer Sale.
[2047.00 → 2049.00] I'm just like, oh, it's a perfect deal.
[2049.00 → 2051.00] It's like 85% off.
[2051.00 → 2054.00] Uh, my 360 has also been Badge.
[2054.00 → 2055.00] Where are you from?
[2055.00 → 2057.00] What does Badge mean?
[2057.00 → 2058.00] I hate it.
[2058.00 → 2059.00] Maybe I should just get a new one.
[2059.00 → 2060.00] I just want Halo.
[2060.00 → 2061.00] That's it.
[2061.00 → 2067.00] Alright, so why don't we move on to our next topic, which happens to be...
[2067.00 → 2070.00] Actually, I'm going to combine this topic with, uh, with another one.
[2070.00 → 2075.00] Microsoft offering schools and colleges 199 Surface RT tablets.
[2075.00 → 2077.00] This article is from Daily Tech.
[2077.00 → 2080.00] So, Windows RT hasn't been the most popular Microsoft product.
[2080.00 → 2083.00] Daily Tech writes, master of the obvious there.
[2083.00 → 2088.00] But, hey, for anyone who hasn't heard of Surface RT, which I think is a lot of people,
[2088.00 → 2090.00] that might be a relevant thing to say.
[2090.00 → 2094.00] Microsoft will soon introduce the Surface for Education limited time offer this month,
[2094.00 → 2098.00] which will offer discounted Surface RTs to schools and colleges interested in adopting the tablet.
[2098.00 → 2102.00] For only 199, the Surface RT retails for 499.
[2102.00 → 2104.00] If schools want blah blah blah, et cetera, et cetera.
[2104.00 → 2105.00] Expected further details.
[2105.00 → 2110.00] And I wanted to tie this into another article that is related.
[2110.00 → 2112.00] Also on Daily Tech at the same time,
[2112.00 → 2117.00] Apple scores $30 million iPad contract from the LA School District.
[2117.00 → 2120.00] Launches Apple Camp for Youngsters.
[2120.00 → 2125.00] The LA Unified School District is paying $678 per iPad,
[2125.00 → 2130.00] which will come preloaded with educational software, but won't include a keyboard.
[2130.00 → 2135.00] They have a three-year warranty that includes free replacement devices up to 5% of the value of the purchase price.
[2135.00 → 2141.00] The $30 million for iPads is a steep contract price, but LA District insisted on the measure
[2141.00 → 2144.00] because new state and national tests will be taken on computers.
[2144.00 → 2147.00] So people have to learn to use computers, et cetera, et cetera.
[2147.00 → 2153.00] That, my friends, is all you need to know about Microsoft Windows RT.
[2156.00 → 2158.00] For one-third of the price.
[2158.00 → 2160.00] Less than one-third of the price.
[2160.00 → 2164.00] And if they bought in that big of bulk, they probably could have got an even better deal.
[2164.00 → 2166.00] Oh, man.
[2166.00 → 2169.00] They still are not winning bids.
[2169.00 → 2170.00] I mean, okay.
[2170.00 → 2174.00] Honestly, that LA School District deal was probably in effect.
[2174.00 → 2176.00] That was probably in talks for a long time.
[2176.00 → 2183.00] And it's not necessarily an indication that LA School District was looking at Surface RT versus iPad
[2183.00 → 2187.00] and ended up going that route in the context of the $199 deal.
[2187.00 → 2189.00] But it's just those two things coming out.
[2189.00 → 2192.00] I think they were posted on Daily Tech on almost the same day.
[2192.00 → 2195.00] I was just kind of looking at it going, wow.
[2195.00 → 2199.00] That's how dominant Apple is in the tablet space.
[2199.00 → 2202.00] I mean, Android has made up enormous ground on phones.
[2202.00 → 2204.00] Android is number one for phones now.
[2204.00 → 2206.00] And that's fantastic.
[2206.00 → 2207.00] And that's cool.
[2207.00 → 2212.00] And as someone who has recently switched to Android and is loving it, I love that too.
[2212.00 → 2215.00] But on the tablet side, what would you use?
[2215.00 → 2218.00] If someone were to give you a tablet.
[2218.00 → 2221.00] But you know I wouldn't use a tablet.
[2221.00 → 2222.00] It doesn't matter.
[2222.00 → 2224.00] They're going to give it to you.
[2224.00 → 2226.00] You don't have to use it, but you have to have one.
[2226.00 → 2227.00] You can give it away.
[2227.00 → 2228.00] You can sell it.
[2228.00 → 2229.00] It doesn't matter.
[2229.00 → 2231.00] I'd like vendor trash pawn it, to be honest.
[2231.00 → 2232.00] I would never use a tablet.
[2232.00 → 2233.00] It doesn't matter.
[2233.00 → 2234.00] Someone's giving it to you for free.
[2234.00 → 2235.00] I hate tablets.
[2235.00 → 2238.00] I'd like to use to give you anything but a tablet.
[2238.00 → 2244.00] And remember, your options are basically Windows 8, Windows RT, and iOS and Android.
[2244.00 → 2246.00] If I could get the full Windows 8 one?
[2246.00 → 2247.00] Okay, no.
[2247.00 → 2248.00] Your options are Windows RT, iOS and Android.
[2248.00 → 2250.00] Let's go with ARM operating systems.
[2250.00 → 2253.00] If I could get the full Windows 8 one, I'd get the full Windows 8 one.
[2253.00 → 2254.00] Hands down.
[2254.00 → 2255.00] It's actually a terrible experience.
[2255.00 → 2256.00] Really?
[2256.00 → 2257.00] It's really terrible.
[2257.00 → 2258.00] I haven't used it.
[2258.00 → 2263.00] The problem is that there's, like, I cannot make myself use modern UI, even on a tablet.
[2263.00 → 2264.00] I just can't do it.
[2264.00 → 2266.00] It's just not very functional.
[2266.00 → 2268.00] But you can install desktop applications.
[2268.00 → 2269.00] Yes, you can.
[2269.00 → 2276.00] But using Windows 8 in desktop mode with a touch screen is really not any better than using Windows 7.
[2276.00 → 2278.00] It's just not.
[2278.00 → 2280.00] The buttons are still tiny.
[2280.00 → 2281.00] The things...
[2281.00 → 2282.00] You can enlarge stuff.
[2282.00 → 2283.00] I know, but it's...
[2283.00 → 2284.00] Okay, you haven't done it.
[2284.00 → 2285.00] I know.
[2285.00 → 2286.00] I'm telling you.
[2286.00 → 2287.00] I know.
[2287.00 → 2288.00] It does weird stuff.
[2288.00 → 2290.00] Like, when you click the...
[2290.00 → 2291.00] Like, when you open up a keyboard...
[2291.00 → 2294.00] And this is weird, because it was doing it on my tablet the other day, when I was trying
[2294.00 → 2295.00] to use it for something.
[2295.00 → 2298.00] You open up the keyboard, it takes your Windows, and it, like, resizes them.
[2298.00 → 2300.00] And then you close the keyboard, and they stay up there.
[2300.00 → 2301.00] And I'm just like, really?
[2301.00 → 2303.00] Like, really?
[2303.00 → 2307.00] And I know it's meant to be used in modern UI, and I understand that.
[2307.00 → 2309.00] But, like, really?
[2309.00 → 2311.00] Also, I'd always have the keyboard camera on.
[2311.00 → 2314.00] Anyway, iPad, hands down for me.
[2314.00 → 2315.00] For tablet experience.
[2315.00 → 2316.00] There is no comparison.
[2316.00 → 2317.00] Whatsoever.
[2317.00 → 2318.00] I don't really have enough experience.
[2318.00 → 2324.00] I would like to say Android, but the one Android tablet that I've used, and only one...
[2324.00 → 2325.00] That's the Transformer, right?
[2325.00 → 2326.00] The original Transformer.
[2326.00 → 2327.00] Yeah.
[2327.00 → 2328.00] Was not a very good use case.
[2328.00 → 2331.00] And, honestly, that had the latest software at the time.
[2331.00 → 2333.00] Like, it wasn't like it was running, like, some stupid...
[2333.00 → 2334.00] At the time, yes.
[2334.00 → 2335.00] But this was a while ago.
[2335.00 → 2336.00] But that was Ice Cream Sandwich.
[2336.00 → 2337.00] Yeah.
[2337.00 → 2338.00] I never liked Ice Cream Sandwich, though.
[2338.00 → 2343.00] I mean, I don't think the tablet experience has changed much since Ice Cream Sandwich, so...
[2343.00 → 2344.00] Yeah.
[2344.00 → 2347.00] And, I mean, yeah, okay, I'm sure there's feature here and feature there, but...
[2347.00 → 2349.00] But, like, I don't like iPad either.
[2349.00 → 2350.00] Okay.
[2350.00 → 2352.00] I don't know.
[2352.00 → 2353.00] I'm not a tablet guy.
[2353.00 → 2358.00] If I'm laying on the couch, and I need to check my email, I'm completely cool with using my phone.
[2358.00 → 2359.00] Okay.
[2359.00 → 2363.00] I don't see why I need this, like, slightly bigger one.
[2363.00 → 2365.00] I actually type faster on a phone than I do on a tablet.
[2365.00 → 2366.00] Yeah, me too.
[2366.00 → 2367.00] That's for sure.
[2367.00 → 2368.00] Yeah.
[2368.00 → 2369.00] So, I don't know.
[2369.00 → 2370.00] I'm really not into tablets.
[2370.00 → 2373.00] Alright, tell us about your NASA, which is completely different from NSA.
[2373.00 → 2375.00] We're not talking about that other thing.
[2375.00 → 2376.00] So, this is kind of cool.
[2376.00 → 2381.00] If you go to a link that's in this article, maybe we can tweet it out or something.
[2381.00 → 2382.00] I'll try and...
[2382.00 → 2383.00] We could just click on it here.
[2383.00 → 2384.00] They're looking at it.
[2384.00 → 2386.00] It's a billion pixels.
[2386.00 → 2387.00] It's a billion...
[2387.00 → 2388.00] Oh, right.
[2388.00 → 2389.00] Okay, so...
[2389.00 → 2390.00] You might not want to click on that.
[2390.00 → 2391.00] That might crash the stream.
[2391.00 → 2392.00] Yeah.
[2392.00 → 2393.00] So, it's...
[2393.00 → 2397.00] I haven't looked at it yet, but it's apparently an awesome semi-panorama, or completely
[2397.00 → 2398.00] panorama pixel...
[2398.00 → 2399.00] Uh, picture.
[2399.00 → 2402.00] Which is a billion pixels, and it's supposed to just look very, very cool of Mars.
[2402.00 → 2406.00] It was where they were picking up some, like, dust and sand and rocks and stuff.
[2406.00 → 2410.00] It's the Curiosity rover, and it's actually pretty freaking cool.
[2410.00 → 2415.00] I like it when NASA sends back, like, a bunch of really cool pictures and stuff.
[2415.00 → 2416.00] I don't know.
[2416.00 → 2419.00] For how little funding they get, they're quite interactive.
[2419.00 → 2421.00] Oh, NASA.
[2421.00 → 2425.00] You used to be everyone's favourite child, and now you're just...
[2425.00 → 2428.00] Just don't get much funding.
[2428.00 → 2429.00] Yeah.
[2429.00 → 2432.00] Alright, why don't we do a Twitter blitz?
[2432.00 → 2435.00] Everyone, hit us on Twitter!
[2435.00 → 2438.00] Actually, what we'll probably end up doing is going through most of the Twitter questions
[2438.00 → 2439.00] we got last time.
[2439.00 → 2443.00] I love how we actually didn't set up a light in here, so we're just relying on the light
[2443.00 → 2449.00] coming in from that window over there, which is actually darkening as the stream goes on,
[2449.00 → 2452.00] making it so that we're getting pretty dark here.
[2452.00 → 2454.00] But, uh, there's, uh, that's fine.
[2454.00 → 2456.00] Alright, how do you like your new Blackberry?
[2456.00 → 2461.00] In two words, three words or fewer.
[2461.00 → 2463.00] The conclusion video isn't out yet.
[2463.00 → 2465.00] Yeah, the conclusion video's not out yet.
[2465.00 → 2466.00] Whatever, just tell them.
[2466.00 → 2468.00] Uh, I will be...
[2468.00 → 2471.00] I can't do...
[2471.00 → 2473.00] Returning to S3.
[2473.00 → 2474.00] Okay, there you go.
[2474.00 → 2476.00] I was thinking I'm not switching would have also worked.
[2476.00 → 2477.00] Okay.
[2477.00 → 2479.00] But, either way, I think we achieved the...
[2479.00 → 2481.00] So, do you know if this is real?
[2481.00 → 2482.00] Okay, I'm not...
[2482.00 → 2483.00] Oh, my goodness.
[2483.00 → 2484.00] How are people...
[2484.00 → 2487.00] Do you not read URLs before you click on them?
[2487.00 → 2488.00] Let me tell you.
[2488.00 → 2491.00] In their defence, the R going to the N does kinda look like an M.
[2491.00 → 2499.00] As a seasoned internet user, I look carefully at that URL before I click it.
[2499.00 → 2502.00] Okay, tuning in from Croatia.
[2502.00 → 2503.00] Sweet!
[2503.00 → 2508.00] I hate that so much, because I have to click on the window in order to use the mouse to scroll,
[2508.00 → 2511.00] or the wheel to scroll, but then it always expands people's tweets.
[2511.00 → 2512.00] What is Rant30?
[2512.00 → 2513.00] I don't know.
[2513.00 → 2514.00] Okay.
[2514.00 → 2515.00] I recognize that.
[2515.00 → 2516.00] Tablet plus NEW emulator.
[2516.00 → 2517.00] Isn't that a thing Logan does?
[2517.00 → 2518.00] Uh, Rant30?
[2518.00 → 2521.00] Well, my inbox, EXE, and the tech are the only ones I know.
[2521.00 → 2522.00] I think he does Rant30.
[2522.00 → 2523.00] Does he do a new Rant thing?
[2523.00 → 2524.00] I think so.
[2524.00 → 2525.00] Oh, okay.
[2525.00 → 2526.00] Let me see.
[2526.00 → 2527.00] You keep going.
[2527.00 → 2529.00] Uh, watching the Linus Tech Tips livestream.
[2529.00 → 2530.00] Yay!
[2530.00 → 2532.00] While finishing up my keyboard.
[2532.00 → 2533.00] Okay!
[2533.00 → 2534.00] Hmm?
[2534.00 → 2536.00] Maybe changing out keycaps or something like that?
[2536.00 → 2537.00] Changing out keycaps, cleaning something.
[2537.00 → 2538.00] Sure.
[2538.00 → 2539.00] Will you purchase either of...
[2539.00 → 2540.00] I still gotta play a Star craft game with you.
[2540.00 → 2541.00] I recognize that, Twitter.
[2541.00 → 2544.00] Will you purchase either of the new consoles?
[2544.00 → 2546.00] Yeah, TechSynicateRant30.
[2546.00 → 2547.00] Um...
[2547.00 → 2548.00] No?
[2548.00 → 2549.00] No?
[2549.00 → 2550.00] Probably not.
[2550.00 → 2551.00] Or I'll wait until like the next iteration.
[2551.00 → 2552.00] Cause there's going to be like the...
[2552.00 → 2553.00] You know it's going to be like 10 years, right?
[2553.00 → 2554.00] Yeah, but it's gonna...
[2554.00 → 2561.00] You're going to be like in your mid-thirties by the time you can buy one of these because
[2561.00 → 2563.00] the new one's out.
[2563.00 → 2568.00] No, I don't mean next iteration as in like PlayStation 4 and Xbox whatever the heck they
[2568.00 → 2569.00] decide to name it.
[2569.00 → 2571.00] I mean like Xbox Elite.
[2571.00 → 2572.00] Oh!
[2572.00 → 2573.00] Oh!
[2573.00 → 2574.00] Oh!
[2574.00 → 2575.00] Oh!
[2575.00 → 2576.00] Okay.
[2576.00 → 2577.00] Like the new model.
[2577.00 → 2578.00] Cause there's always the new model.
[2578.00 → 2581.00] Like the lower power one that comes with all the features the original one should have.
[2581.00 → 2582.00] Yeah, yeah.
[2582.00 → 2583.00] Right, okay.
[2583.00 → 2585.00] So I'm gonna wait for like the nicer models.
[2585.00 → 2586.00] So you're waiting for Surface Pack 1?
[2586.00 → 2587.00] Basically.
[2587.00 → 2588.00] Okay.
[2588.00 → 2590.00] Because then at the same time there will be more games.
[2590.00 → 2591.00] Right, okay.
[2591.00 → 2595.00] Cause buying consoles at release, and as far as I know these will have a huge plethora
[2595.00 → 2596.00] of games.
[2596.00 → 2597.00] Right.
[2597.00 → 2598.00] Which will be nice.
[2598.00 → 2601.00] But buying consoles at release I find there's usually not enough.
[2601.00 → 2604.00] There's going to be a half a dozen games that are maybe worth playing.
[2604.00 → 2605.00] Yeah.
[2605.00 → 2608.00] You know, I'm sticking with my whole thing where I always own like the previous generation
[2608.00 → 2609.00] one.
[2609.00 → 2612.00] So when PS1 came out...
[2612.00 → 2614.00] Actually no, I never did get an N64.
[2614.00 → 2615.00] Okay.
[2615.00 → 2616.00] We're not including Wii U in this.
[2616.00 → 2620.00] But when PS2 came out I got a PlayStation 1 like right at that time.
[2620.00 → 2623.00] When PlayStation 3 came out I got a PlayStation 2.
[2623.00 → 2624.00] Super cheap I guess.
[2624.00 → 2625.00] Boom.
[2625.00 → 2627.00] I've only played like two games on it though.
[2627.00 → 2628.00] I played through all...
[2628.00 → 2629.00] Actually no, more than that.
[2629.00 → 2631.00] I played through all the PS2 Final Fantasies.
[2631.00 → 2632.00] Okay.
[2632.00 → 2634.00] So but honestly they started getting really terrible.
[2634.00 → 2637.00] Like X2 was just awful.
[2637.00 → 2640.00] The Final Fantasy MMO apparently is re-releasing it.
[2640.00 → 2641.00] It's supposed to be way better than it was.
[2641.00 → 2642.00] Whatever, it's an MMO.
[2642.00 → 2644.00] I'm not paying a subscription to play a game.
[2644.00 → 2645.00] Is it a subscription?
[2645.00 → 2646.00] I don't know.
[2646.00 → 2647.00] I don't care.
[2647.00 → 2648.00] Yeah, I'm not really that interested.
[2648.00 → 2649.00] Elder Scrolls Online is coming.
[2649.00 → 2650.00] Elder Scrolls Online is coming.
[2650.00 → 2651.00] Yeah, okay.
[2651.00 → 2652.00] Yeah.
[2652.00 → 2653.00] I won't talk about it.
[2653.00 → 2654.00] Stop talking about it.
[2654.00 → 2658.00] Do you know what's funny is I believe there was a tweet or something in Twitch chat last
[2658.00 → 2660.00] time around that was like, oh Slick's not here.
[2660.00 → 2662.00] We won't have to hear about Elder Scrolls.
[2662.00 → 2664.00] I didn't get in the beta again.
[2664.00 → 2665.00] Anyway.
[2665.00 → 2666.00] Keep going.
[2666.00 → 2667.00] Watching live from Brazil.
[2667.00 → 2668.00] Hello.
[2668.00 → 2669.00] Hello.
[2669.00 → 2671.00] Can you clone your hard drive to an SSD without losing your OS?
[2671.00 → 2672.00] Yes.
[2672.00 → 2673.00] Yep.
[2673.00 → 2674.00] I don't know.
[2674.00 → 2675.00] I don't know.
[2675.00 → 2676.00] I don't know.
[2676.00 → 2677.00] The other thing is that they're going to have to be getting rid of the other ones.
[2677.00 → 2678.00] Yeah.
[2678.00 → 2679.00] I don't know.
[2679.00 → 2680.00] I don't know.
[2680.00 → 2681.00] I don't know.
[2681.00 → 2682.00] I don't know.
[2682.00 → 2683.00] I don't know.
[2683.00 → 2684.00] Left 4 Dead 3.
[2684.00 → 2686.00] That was the other one that was rumoured to be coming.
[2686.00 → 2687.00] Right.
[2687.00 → 2691.00] Although quite frankly, if it's anything like Left 4 Dead 1 to Left 4 Dead 2 in terms of
[2691.00 → 2693.00] changes, then you know what, Valve?
[2693.00 → 2695.00] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2695.00 → 2696.00] That's not a middle finger.
[2696.00 → 2697.00] I guess that's not technically.
[2697.00 → 2698.00] Yeah.
[2698.00 → 2699.00] Alright.
[2699.00 → 2700.00] But either way.
[2700.00 → 2701.00] Yeah.
[2701.00 → 2705.00] That was not worth the 50 bucks or whatever I paid for Left 4 Dead 2.
[2705.00 → 2707.00] It was the same game.
[2707.00 → 2711.00] It was like, yeah, we changed the skin colour of the chick and the dude.
[2711.00 → 2712.00] We swapped them.
[2712.00 → 2713.00] There was a...
[2713.00 → 2714.00] Like, pallet swap.
[2714.00 → 2716.00] I played Left 4 Dead a bit, but I didn't play Left 4 Dead 2.
[2716.00 → 2717.00] It was the same game.
[2717.00 → 2718.00] Wasn't there like a few more different...
[2718.00 → 2719.00] They added some monsters.
[2719.00 → 2721.00] It could have been a DLC.
[2721.00 → 2722.00] How much did it cost?
[2722.00 → 2723.00] For like $4.99.
[2723.00 → 2724.00] It was a full game release.
[2724.00 → 2725.00] Oof.
[2725.00 → 2726.00] Yeah, it was brutal.
[2726.00 → 2729.00] What's a good PSU for a single GPU PC?
[2729.00 → 2730.00] Depends on...
[2730.00 → 2733.00] Right now, that kind of depends on what CPU you're running.
[2733.00 → 2734.00] With Haswell coming around.
[2734.00 → 2735.00] Yeah, that's true.
[2735.00 → 2738.00] Get a Haswell Ready 1 so it supports the deep sleep states.
[2738.00 → 2740.00] And, I don't know, I mean...
[2740.00 → 2743.00] If you're running a Haswell chip, you can get quite low.
[2743.00 → 2745.00] How about what's not a good PSU?
[2745.00 → 2747.00] Really, really, really, really low wattage?
[2747.00 → 2748.00] Yeah, cheap ones.
[2748.00 → 2750.00] Or way, way, way, way, way too high wattage?
[2750.00 → 2752.00] Any good brand name.
[2752.00 → 2757.00] You know, 500 to 600 watt is going to be pretty safe for almost any single GPU.
[2757.00 → 2761.00] You know, Corsair, Cooler Master, Sea sonic, Aztec.
[2761.00 → 2765.00] With Ivy, I saw a lot of people going 600 watt.
[2765.00 → 2766.00] Yeah.
[2766.00 → 2768.00] With Haswell now, I've seen a lot of people dropping it down to 500 watt.
[2768.00 → 2769.00] Yep.
[2769.00 → 2770.00] Everyone seems fine.
[2770.00 → 2773.00] In our Haswell build guide, where we put in a GTX 780.
[2773.00 → 2774.00] Right.
[2774.00 → 2775.00] Yeah.
[2775.00 → 2778.00] We put in what, like a 520 watt power supply?
[2778.00 → 2780.00] Didn't even come close to maxing it out.
[2780.00 → 2781.00] Totally fine, yeah.
[2781.00 → 2782.00] Love the show.
[2782.00 → 2783.00] Thank you!
[2783.00 → 2784.00] Yay.
[2784.00 → 2785.00] Kareem VFX.
[2785.00 → 2787.00] Good morning from Romania.
[2787.00 → 2789.00] Oh, I have actually, this is not related to Twitter.
[2789.00 → 2793.00] We'll get back to Twitter in a moment, but we're looking at potentially adding a call-in
[2793.00 → 2794.00] segment.
[2794.00 → 2795.00] Right.
[2795.00 → 2796.00] Soon.
[2796.00 → 2799.00] So guys, we might, I don't know how long it'll be.
[2799.00 → 2801.00] I don't know exactly how it's going to work yet.
[2801.00 → 2804.00] But we're going to do a trial run next week.
[2804.00 → 2809.00] And then the official one, sponsored by our unnamed sponsor, who will be announced at
[2809.00 → 2811.00] some point, will be probably the following week.
[2811.00 → 2813.00] But we haven't gotten 100% confirmation on that yet.
[2813.00 → 2814.00] Cool.
[2814.00 → 2815.00] That's going to be very cool.
[2815.00 → 2816.00] There we go.
[2816.00 → 2817.00] Good morning from Romania.
[2817.00 → 2818.00] Hi!
[2818.00 → 2819.00] LCD or LED?
[2819.00 → 2820.00] Go watch the video on Tech Quickie.
[2820.00 → 2821.00] LCD versus LED.
[2821.00 → 2824.00] They don't happen to be different things, necessarily.
[2824.00 → 2829.00] Have you seen how to uninstall McAfee antivirus on YouTube?
[2829.00 → 2830.00] No, I haven't.
[2830.00 → 2836.00] If it's anything like the how to install iOS 7 video, it's probably just ridiculous.
[2836.00 → 2837.00] Yeah.
[2837.00 → 2839.00] Left 4 Dead 3.
[2839.00 → 2842.00] Also, why you know, say Linux like your name with an X.
[2842.00 → 2843.00] Oh, Steve.
[2843.00 → 2848.00] That's the worst question I think anyone's ever sent into this show.
[2848.00 → 2851.00] Because it's not my name.
[2851.00 → 2855.00] Well, even the Linux guy's name is Linus the same as mine.
[2855.00 → 2857.00] What kind of question is that?
[2857.00 → 2859.00] Linux isn't a name.
[2859.00 → 2860.00] Yeah.
[2860.00 → 2861.00] Are you leaving?
[2861.00 → 2862.00] Yeah.
[2862.00 → 2863.00] Oh, okay.
[2863.00 → 2865.00] Do you want to pop in and say hi?
[2865.00 → 2867.00] Do you guys want Diesel to pop in and say hi?
[2867.00 → 2868.00] Hold on.
[2868.00 → 2870.00] I'm going to check and see if Twitch chat even wants you to.
[2870.00 → 2871.00] He wants me to knock on the wall.
[2871.00 → 2874.00] No, if they don't want you to, then we're not going to...
[2874.00 → 2875.00] Oh, oh.
[2875.00 → 2876.00] Unanimously, no.
[2876.00 → 2877.00] No.
[2877.00 → 2878.00] No, no.
[2878.00 → 2879.00] They're all saying yes.
[2879.00 → 2880.00] They're all saying yes.
[2880.00 → 2881.00] You can come join us.
[2881.00 → 2883.00] So, guys, if you haven't seen them already...
[2883.00 → 2884.00] Just lean over.
[2884.00 → 2885.00] Get comfy.
[2885.00 → 2886.00] Diesel the intern is joining us.
[2886.00 → 2887.00] Hello.
[2887.00 → 2889.00] Okay, now I'm going to go.
[2889.00 → 2890.00] Okay.
[2890.00 → 2892.00] Alright, can I see you Monday?
[2892.00 → 2893.00] See ya.
[2893.00 → 2896.00] Yeah, for those of you who don't know, we're in the new HQ.
[2896.00 → 2897.00] So, everyone's here.
[2897.00 → 2899.00] We're all working.
[2899.00 → 2904.00] Enjoying our Linus Media Group lucrative, high paying jobs that...
[2904.00 → 2906.00] Shut up.
[2906.00 → 2909.00] That YouTube money, right?
[2909.00 → 2911.00] Whatever, man.
[2911.00 → 2914.00] Khakis is Australian for car keys.
[2914.00 → 2917.00] I actually kind of believe that, although I think you're pulling my leg.
[2917.00 → 2920.00] What fans do you recommend for the H100?
[2920.00 → 2922.00] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2922.00 → 2924.00] You got three guesses and the first two don't count.
[2924.00 → 2925.00] Noctua.
[2925.00 → 2926.00] What model?
[2926.00 → 2927.00] NFF12.
[2927.00 → 2928.00] Noctua NFF12.
[2928.00 → 2929.00] Thank you.
[2929.00 → 2930.00] Same thing.
[2930.00 → 2932.00] Check out our cooling benches.
[2932.00 → 2933.00] They're really freaking good.
[2933.00 → 2934.00] You know what?
[2934.00 → 2939.00] Here is something that I would like to get some feedback from the viewers on.
[2939.00 → 2943.00] And, okay, so we're done with that Twitter blitz for now.
[2943.00 → 2944.00] I know what this is.
[2944.00 → 2947.00] Guys, you know how much I love Noctua.
[2947.00 → 2948.00] Okay.
[2948.00 → 2951.00] So, you probably know how much I love Noctua.
[2951.00 → 2954.00] Noctua doesn't really do a lot of marketing.
[2954.00 → 2956.00] Like, have you ever seen...
[2956.00 → 2957.00] That's an understatement.
[2957.00 → 2959.00] Have you ever seen a Noctua ad?
[2959.00 → 2960.00] Ask yourself that.
[2960.00 → 2964.00] However much you also happen to love Noctua, if you love them as much as we do.
[2964.00 → 2965.00] One quick thing I'm going to jut in.
[2965.00 → 2972.00] When we were going through the computer, like, crazy computer shop area in Korea, there was a store that only sold Noctua products.
[2972.00 → 2973.00] That's awesome.
[2973.00 → 2974.00] It wasn't a Noctua store, but they only sold.
[2974.00 → 2975.00] Was it called the Linus store?
[2975.00 → 2976.00] No.
[2976.00 → 2977.00] Oh, okay.
[2977.00 → 2978.00] It should have.
[2978.00 → 2980.00] It should have been called the Linux store, because apparently that's what you know.
[2980.00 → 2983.00] It sells only fans.
[2983.00 → 2985.00] So, we've been talking to Noctua.
[2985.00 → 2988.00] They know how much we love them and their products.
[2988.00 → 2994.00] We were blown away by the cool friggin' stuff that we saw at their booth at Computer.
[2994.00 → 2999.00] And we basically sat down with them, and we went, look, we love your products.
[2999.00 → 3001.00] We want to pimp your products.
[3001.00 → 3004.00] We pimp your products even though you've never spent a dollar with us.
[3004.00 → 3005.00] Yeah.
[3005.00 → 3006.00] In terms of sponsorship or advertising.
[3006.00 → 3007.00] See a B roll.
[3007.00 → 3019.00] Well, is there any way that you guys would consider sponsoring us in some way so that if we're going to pimp your products anyway, we can at least turn this into some kind of mutually supportive relationship?
[3019.00 → 3026.00] Because let me tell you, Noctua has already noticed how much traffic is coming to their website from Linus Tech Tips Forum.
[3026.00 → 3027.00] Cool.
[3027.00 → 3028.00] And I was like, you know what's funny?
[3028.00 → 3037.00] Is what you've probably seen a lot of is, I think these fans are ugly, but Linus recommends them for some reason.
[3037.00 → 3038.00] So, I might as well look at them.
[3038.00 → 3040.00] So, you should probably buy them.
[3040.00 → 3044.00] And they were, it's funny because their engineer burst out laughing.
[3044.00 → 3046.00] He was like, yeah, that's exactly what they said.
[3048.00 → 3054.00] It's like these ugly fans that inexplicably Linus gets like a raging B word over.
[3054.00 → 3066.00] So, anyway, I was like, I was sitting down with them, and I'm like, how do we make this something that makes sense, that doesn't compromise our integrity, because honestly, I don't want it to be like a paid thing.
[3066.00 → 3067.00] Yeah.
[3067.00 → 3069.00] Because we'll, honestly though, it, it, it.
[3069.00 → 3071.00] And we'll, we'll continue doing it even if they don't give us a dollar.
[3071.00 → 3074.00] Because we do so much already.
[3074.00 → 3077.00] Cooler reviews, anything that ever needs a fan.
[3077.00 → 3080.00] Even in the room tour we shot the other day of this room.
[3080.00 → 3081.00] You brought, I know.
[3081.00 → 3086.00] I'm like, there's my pilot Noctua's that I don't actually use in my own system.
[3086.00 → 3088.00] Oh man, the new black ones though.
[3088.00 → 3089.00] Oh.
[3089.00 → 3090.00] Man.
[3090.00 → 3091.00] I need those.
[3091.00 → 3093.00] They're like $30 a fan.
[3093.00 → 3094.00] People will buy them though.
[3094.00 → 3095.00] I know.
[3095.00 → 3096.00] That's a thing.
[3096.00 → 3097.00] I know.
[3097.00 → 3102.00] And like, okay, I saw one complaint about the brown rubber noise dance thing on the corners.
[3102.00 → 3103.00] They're not that bad.
[3103.00 → 3104.00] And you can take them off.
[3104.00 → 3105.00] You can take them off?
[3105.00 → 3106.00] Yeah.
[3106.00 → 3107.00] Well, you can take them off on the current ones.
[3107.00 → 3108.00] That's true.
[3108.00 → 3109.00] So I'm assuming you can take them off.
[3109.00 → 3110.00] That's true.
[3110.00 → 3111.00] Okay, so guys, we want your feedback.
[3111.00 → 3116.00] How could Linus Tech Tips possibly collaborate with Noctua in some way that wouldn't bother
[3116.00 → 3121.00] you guys, but that would be, you know, somehow help Linus Media Group pay our bills.
[3121.00 → 3122.00] Because we have a lot of them.
[3122.00 → 3123.00] Yeah.
[3123.00 → 3126.00] So I'm going to the Twitter boards, and I'm opening up the Twitch chat, and I'm going to
[3126.00 → 3128.00] look at what you guys have to say.
[3128.00 → 3131.00] I'm going to try and read the Twitch chat, but you all don't have a lot of, uh...
[3131.00 → 3132.00] Oh my.
[3132.00 → 3135.00] Apparently there's like massive horse penises in the Twitch chat.
[3135.00 → 3139.00] So we're going to go to, uh, we're going to go back to Twitter here.
[3139.00 → 3144.00] Uh, I, okay, I have no idea that, anyway.
[3144.00 → 3145.00] Fan controller, yes or no?
[3145.00 → 3149.00] Um, I personally don't like manual fan controllers because I think they're super pointless.
[3149.00 → 3151.00] You're never going to touch it.
[3151.00 → 3152.00] Yeah.
[3152.00 → 3154.00] But automated fan controllers, yay.
[3154.00 → 3155.00] Stuff like T-Balancer, which we both have.
[3155.00 → 3156.00] Did you ever get yours working?
[3156.00 → 3157.00] Yeah.
[3157.00 → 3158.00] Like I sent you the software patch and all that?
[3158.00 → 3159.00] Man, that's ridiculous.
[3159.00 → 3160.00] It's really hard.
[3160.00 → 3161.00] We should do a guide on that.
[3161.00 → 3162.00] I wonder how many...
[3162.00 → 3163.00] I already forgot how to fully do it.
[3163.00 → 3164.00] Me too.
[3164.00 → 3165.00] It took me a while.
[3165.00 → 3170.00] Well, it took me hours the first time, back when I did it like three years ago.
[3170.00 → 3172.00] And then it took me hours the second time.
[3172.00 → 3177.00] Even with your like, kinda ghetto guide thing that you gave me, like it took me a long time.
[3177.00 → 3180.00] Comments on how iOS 7 looks?
[3180.00 → 3183.00] Um, honestly, I am, I find it perfect.
[3183.00 → 3184.00] I'm not sure.
[3184.00 → 3185.00] I'm not sure.
[3185.00 → 3190.00] Honestly, I am, I find it extremely confusing some of the visual changes that they've made
[3190.00 → 3191.00] in iOS 7.
[3191.00 → 3193.00] I don't think it contributes in any meaningful way.
[3193.00 → 3199.00] And Marcus Brownlee, uh, has a fantastic video, sort covering how the innovative features
[3199.00 → 3202.00] in iOS 7, kinda not that innovative.
[3202.00 → 3205.00] To elaborate, I'm running a GTX 570.
[3205.00 → 3206.00] Sorry man, we got that out of order.
[3206.00 → 3208.00] Not much I can do, Seamus.
[3208.00 → 3209.00] I have iOS 7 working fine.
[3209.00 → 3210.00] Cool beans.
[3210.00 → 3212.00] GTX 780 versus 770.
[3212.00 → 3216.00] I don't see a compelling reason to grab a 770 versus a used 680 for example.
[3216.00 → 3220.00] Um, I would grab a 780, however.
[3220.00 → 3221.00] 780's beast.
[3221.00 → 3223.00] If I had the budget for it.
[3223.00 → 3225.00] 780 and 770's not the same ballpark.
[3225.00 → 3227.00] They are not on the same tier.
[3227.00 → 3228.00] Yeah.
[3228.00 → 3230.00] In a way that we actually haven't seen in many generations.
[3230.00 → 3231.00] Yep.
[3231.00 → 3232.00] In fact, I don't think we've ever seen this before.
[3232.00 → 3234.00] Not that big of a spread as far as I know.
[3234.00 → 3235.00] No.
[3235.00 → 3236.00] That's insane.
[3236.00 → 3239.00] Like, even like 9700 Pro, 9500 Pro.
[3239.00 → 3240.00] Same GPU architecture.
[3240.00 → 3241.00] Sure.
[3241.00 → 3242.00] I don't think we've ever seen it.
[3242.00 → 3244.00] Not the same GPU.
[3244.00 → 3246.00] For the top tier and the next tier.
[3246.00 → 3248.00] Well isn't it GK110 and GK104?
[3248.00 → 3249.00] Yeah, yeah.
[3249.00 → 3250.00] Cause the GK1...
[3250.00 → 3251.00] Yeah, I know what you're saying now.
[3251.00 → 3252.00] Like this is the first time we've seen it.
[3252.00 → 3254.00] Sorry, I thought you were saying the exact same one.
[3254.00 → 3256.00] I realize what you're saying now.
[3256.00 → 3258.00] But like, charts break because of it.
[3258.00 → 3259.00] Yeah, I know.
[3259.00 → 3260.00] It's like...
[3260.00 → 3261.00] Boom!
[3261.00 → 3264.00] Yeah, like Slick's having trouble with our...
[3264.00 → 3267.00] 40 new interactions!
[3267.00 → 3269.00] Anything to say about the 8000 series?
[3269.00 → 3270.00] Nope!
[3270.00 → 3274.00] If you make a military build, it's the only way Noctua's look good in a case.
[3274.00 → 3275.00] True that.
[3275.00 → 3278.00] I'm looking for a gaming mouse without a ton of buttons for MMOs.
[3278.00 → 3279.00] Can you recommend me stuff?
[3279.00 → 3281.00] A Corsair M40 actually looks compelling.
[3281.00 → 3283.00] And Death Adder 2013, if you don't mind the hair trigger button.
[3283.00 → 3285.00] Which are driving me crazy.
[3285.00 → 3287.00] If you need a bigger mouse, Funk MS3.
[3287.00 → 3289.00] Funk MS3 is not a bad bet either.
[3289.00 → 3293.00] I would do a build video with all Noctua products and show how to install use, and they sponsor it.
[3293.00 → 3295.00] That's actually not a bad idea.
[3295.00 → 3302.00] Where we do an ultimate silent build, which I think everyone should be on the same page, would contain Noctua products.
[3302.00 → 3303.00] Yeah.
[3303.00 → 3304.00] That's not a bad idea.
[3304.00 → 3305.00] Yeah.
[3305.00 → 3306.00] Okay.
[3306.00 → 3308.00] We need to fight bandwagon and single brand bias.
[3308.00 → 3309.00] You should be impartial.
[3309.00 → 3311.00] Be quiet and fan text is equal more or less.
[3311.00 → 3312.00] No, they're not.
[3312.00 → 3313.00] So, there.
[3313.00 → 3314.00] Um...
[3314.00 → 3317.00] Do you hate Origin or EA?
[3317.00 → 3318.00] Uh...
[3318.00 → 3319.00] Uh...
[3319.00 → 3322.00] Why not make Noctua commercials?
[3322.00 → 3323.00] Your commercials are awesome.
[3323.00 → 3324.00] Ugh.
[3324.00 → 3327.00] The commercials are a huge upfront investment.
[3327.00 → 3331.00] And I think Noctua is looking for more like, you know, um...
[3331.00 → 3332.00] They're very practical.
[3332.00 → 3333.00] Yeah.
[3333.00 → 3336.00] As you may or may not have noticed from the design that goes into their products.
[3336.00 → 3337.00] They're...
[3337.00 → 3342.00] They're going to be more into some type of tech tip or some type of guide or something like that.
[3342.00 → 3343.00] Yeah.
[3343.00 → 3344.00] They're a very technical community.
[3344.00 → 3347.00] Like a guide is more something that I can imagine them being interested in.
[3347.00 → 3348.00] Yeah.
[3348.00 → 3349.00] Where it educates their...
[3349.00 → 3351.00] Their users in some meaningful way.
[3351.00 → 3352.00] Um...
[3352.00 → 3354.00] I only ever use Noctua's as all my case fans.
[3354.00 → 3355.00] Uh...
[3355.00 → 3356.00] What about 29-inch monitors?
[3356.00 → 3359.00] I have no idea how those two things are related.
[3359.00 → 3360.00] Um...
[3360.00 → 3363.00] Ads before actual video content like we normally do wouldn't bother me.
[3363.00 → 3364.00] Okay.
[3364.00 → 3366.00] How about a Linus design fan?
[3366.00 → 3367.00] Like how pro gamers have mice and keyboards.
[3367.00 → 3368.00] You know what?
[3368.00 → 3369.00] Honestly, I pitched it.
[3369.00 → 3370.00] Um...
[3370.00 → 3371.00] Yeah.
[3371.00 → 3372.00] I...
[3372.00 → 3373.00] I wanted to do it.
[3373.00 → 3376.00] I was like, guys, let me add one of your products.
[3376.00 → 3379.00] Let me make some tweaks that I think will make sense visually.
[3379.00 → 3383.00] And, uh, let me turn it into something that I would proudly put in my system.
[3383.00 → 3388.00] Because as much as I love Noctua and I refuse to use anything else on like, test benches or whatever else,
[3388.00 → 3394.00] they still haven't found a home in my system, even though they are superior to every product I use in my system and I know it.
[3394.00 → 3397.00] Because I just can't handle the looks, although the new black ones will...
[3397.00 → 3399.00] They will change all that.
[3399.00 → 3400.00] Oh my goodness, they look so good.
[3400.00 → 3401.00] So, super excited about that.
[3401.00 → 3402.00] Um...
[3402.00 → 3406.00] I feel as though even being paid by Noctua wouldn't be a bad thing as they're a great brand.
[3406.00 → 3407.00] Yep.
[3407.00 → 3408.00] Still though.
[3408.00 → 3411.00] Get Linus to replace the girl in the top corner of Noctua.at.
[3411.00 → 3414.00] Yeah, I'm not as hot as her.
[3414.00 → 3417.00] I haven't seen her, but I'm sure that I'm not as attractive.
[3417.00 → 3418.00] Uh...
[3418.00 → 3423.00] I'm gonna start putting Linus sent me here in my comments for products.
[3423.00 → 3424.00] Very nice.
[3424.00 → 3427.00] Uh, just be like, Linus uses these fans, put them in your build, though.
[3427.00 → 3428.00] I can't!
[3428.00 → 3430.00] I can't until the black ones come!
[3430.00 → 3431.00] Then I will.
[3431.00 → 3432.00] Then I will.
[3432.00 → 3433.00] Mark my words.
[3433.00 → 3434.00] I believe it.
[3434.00 → 3438.00] Have the fans installed in all your cases, water and rads, so more like a product placement thing.
[3438.00 → 3439.00] We already...
[3439.00 → 3440.00] We already kinda do it, even though they...
[3440.00 → 3442.00] We totally don't already do that!
[3442.00 → 3443.00] I know!
[3443.00 → 3444.00] We should totally start doing that!
[3444.00 → 3447.00] Have a contest where you pay to get entered into a Noctua contest.
[3447.00 → 3449.00] I could use some fans, you could use 10 bucks.
[3449.00 → 3451.00] We don't want to take money from the community for this, though.
[3451.00 → 3453.00] No, I don't like this kind of contests at all.
[3453.00 → 3454.00] Yeah.
[3454.00 → 3455.00] They seem so scummy.
[3455.00 → 3456.00] Yeah, I don't... eh.
[3456.00 → 3459.00] Uh, put your face on the fan boxes.
[3459.00 → 3461.00] Have Josh from Fractal as a booth babe show off the Noctua fans.
[3461.00 → 3462.00] Oh my goodness, that would work so well.
[3462.00 → 3465.00] Fractal has fans, so I don't know that they're gonna want to do that.
[3465.00 → 3467.00] Build a comp together, computer together with Noctua.
[3467.00 → 3468.00] You know what?
[3468.00 → 3472.00] Something like a sponsored build, where we do like, ultimate silence build.
[3472.00 → 3473.00] Might make a lot of sense.
[3473.00 → 3475.00] Maybe I'll reach out to them with that.
[3475.00 → 3480.00] Something that could be really cool, it's really far away, and probably super impractical,
[3480.00 → 3484.00] but if you could go to their facility and see how they test like, noise levels and all that other kind of stuff.
[3484.00 → 3486.00] Because we've done that before, but Noctua does it really well.
[3486.00 → 3488.00] That would be phenomenally expensive, though.
[3488.00 → 3489.00] Oh, I know.
[3489.00 → 3491.00] Because you have to fly at least Mi Plus One.
[3491.00 → 3492.00] Like I said, super not practical.
[3492.00 → 3493.00] To Austria.
[3493.00 → 3494.00] Super far away.
[3494.00 → 3495.00] You know what's funny?
[3495.00 → 3496.00] It would just be really cool.
[3496.00 → 3500.00] I'm convinced at this point that all Austrian computer companies know each other.
[3500.00 → 3502.00] Well, they probably do.
[3502.00 → 3503.00] What are you trying to do?
[3503.00 → 3505.00] Here, go do another topic in the meantime.
[3505.00 → 3507.00] Wow, that was random.
[3507.00 → 3510.00] Let me find the topic list and find something to talk about.
[3510.00 → 3515.00] Uh, the the the the the the the the the.
[3515.00 → 3518.00] Wow, I don't have anything on here.
[3518.00 → 3520.00] Sorry guys, give me a second.
[3520.00 → 3525.00] It's open at a tab.
[3525.00 → 3527.00] On yours?
[3527.00 → 3528.00] Yeah.
[3528.00 → 3530.00] Sorry, give me one sec.
[3530.00 → 3532.00] And it's scene three, just push it to the screen.
[3532.00 → 3533.00] Okay.
[3533.00 → 3536.00] I don't know how to do that.
[3536.00 → 3538.00] I'm going to jump into something super random.
[3538.00 → 3542.00] He has it titled as, the the the the the, erotic adventure with Oculus Rift.
[3542.00 → 3546.00] So, basically what's going on is people are developing games for Oculus Rift already.
[3546.00 → 3549.00] Oculus Rift is virtual reality that goes on your head.
[3549.00 → 3550.00] It's freaking awesome.
[3550.00 → 3551.00] I've tried it.
[3551.00 → 3555.00] Check out our, what's it called, Omni Video to see Oculus Rift in action.
[3555.00 → 3556.00] Oculus Rift is very, very cool.
[3556.00 → 3559.00] Another thing to check out on this same topic is EVE VR.
[3559.00 → 3561.00] Or EVE VR.
[3561.00 → 3566.00] It's a dog fighting style space combat game inspired by EVE.
[3566.00 → 3569.00] Made by CCP, which is the guys that make EVE.
[3569.00 → 3571.00] But it's done with Oculus Rift.
[3571.00 → 3574.00] And that with Razor Hydra.
[3574.00 → 3575.00] Ah, that would be so cool.
[3575.00 → 3577.00] I got so excited when I saw that trailer.
[3577.00 → 3580.00] If you haven't seen it yet, and you're interested in VR, definitely check that out.
[3580.00 → 3585.00] But back onto the topic that's in here is Oculus Rift erotic adventure.
[3585.00 → 3593.00] One thing that Linus put in here is how detrimental is this to have it released before the Oculus Rift even hits the market.
[3593.00 → 3600.00] In my opinion, it could get some bad rep for Oculus Rift, and it could get some bad rep for itself.
[3600.00 → 3603.00] Because of certain people that aren't going to want this.
[3603.00 → 3609.00] But if people don't think there is already erotic games, like you're delusional.
[3609.00 → 3610.00] There are tons of them already.
[3610.00 → 3611.00] They're out there.
[3611.00 → 3615.00] People don't have to play them and people won't have to play the one with Oculus Rift.
[3615.00 → 3617.00] It's not a requirement.
[3617.00 → 3622.00] So in my opinion, you probably should have seen this coming.
[3622.00 → 3623.00] It was going to happen.
[3623.00 → 3628.00] If you're a parent, just monitor your kid's game library or whatever.
[3628.00 → 3631.00] Just make sure they don't play it if you don't want them to play it.
[3631.00 → 3634.00] I don't think it's the biggest deal.
[3634.00 → 3639.00] This kind of stuff will happen to everything.
[3639.00 → 3641.00] Everyone saw this coming.
[3641.00 → 3647.00] The fact that it's releasing before Oculus Rift hits the market is interesting, but not that surprising.
[3647.00 → 3650.00] Because they're going to want this available for everyone right away.
[3650.00 → 3653.00] And it's probably not going to have to be the highest quality thing in the world.
[3653.00 → 3655.00] So that's really not that surprising.
[3655.00 → 3657.00] What are you doing?
[3657.00 → 3658.00] That's weird.
[3658.00 → 3659.00] And not in focus.
[3659.00 → 3663.00] Focusing is often my problem.
[3667.00 → 3669.00] So why did you grab the Angel Bird?
[3669.00 → 3670.00] The Angel Bird.
[3670.00 → 3671.00] This is hilarious.
[3671.00 → 3675.00] Because we did an unboxing of this aluminum enclosure.
[3675.00 → 3677.00] I mean the craftsmanship of this thing is outstanding.
[3677.00 → 3678.00] I think we can all agree on that.
[3678.00 → 3682.00] I found out why it uses USB 3 Type A connectors at the back.
[3682.00 → 3683.00] Did I tell you this yet?
[3683.00 → 3689.00] Because, and this is funny because it so validates something I've been ranting about for so long.
[3689.00 → 3703.00] Angel Bird, Austrian company, actually tested every USB 3 connector implementation to find out how many inserts, like in a practical everyday use scenario, how many inserts it was good for.
[3703.00 → 3707.00] And they found that every other connector failed around 350.
[3707.00 → 3708.00] 350?
[3708.00 → 3709.00] Yes.
[3709.00 → 3715.00] Whereas USB A was good for 3500 plus.
[3715.00 → 3722.00] That is why they're using USB 3 on the back, like Type A, on the back of their drive.
[3722.00 → 3725.00] Because they actually validate it, and they actually care.
[3725.00 → 3726.00] Unlike...
[3726.00 → 3727.00] That's beast.
[3727.00 → 3731.00] Cell phone companies, which I find it unbelievable that they all standardized on micro USB.
[3731.00 → 3732.00] Mine is almost kind of broken.
[3732.00 → 3733.00] I've told you about that, right?
[3733.00 → 3734.00] Yeah.
[3734.00 → 3735.00] It's ridiculous.
[3735.00 → 3736.00] It's the worst connector in the world.
[3736.00 → 3737.00] Yep.
[3737.00 → 3739.00] The little contact on the inside of mine is super flimsy.
[3739.00 → 3740.00] Wow.
[3740.00 → 3741.00] Maybe not the worst connector in the world, but it's not good.
[3741.00 → 3742.00] But it's terrible.
[3742.00 → 3743.00] Yeah.
[3743.00 → 3748.00] Expecting it to last, based on that Angel Bird only was able to validate it for around 365,
[3748.00 → 3751.00] and that was the USB 3 one, which is wider.
[3751.00 → 3756.00] I mean, given you have to charge a phone every day, it will not last for three years.
[3756.00 → 3757.00] I have problems with mine.
[3757.00 → 3758.00] Like, it won't.
[3758.00 → 3763.00] Sometimes I have to angle my phone, interestingly, so that it will actually press up against it
[3763.00 → 3764.00] so it will work properly.
[3764.00 → 3768.00] And pushing it in there, sometimes I'm really careful so that I actually get the thing in.
[3768.00 → 3772.00] So, the Angel Bird guys were telling the Noctua guys about our great unboxing, and they're
[3772.00 → 3775.00] like, yeah, he covered our booth too, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3775.00 → 3778.00] So the Angel Bird guy's like, yeah, Jacob from Noctua says hi.
[3778.00 → 3781.00] Like, do you guys all live in the same town or something?
[3781.00 → 3783.00] I'm sure they all talk to each other.
[3783.00 → 3784.00] Anyway, I got a kick out of that.
[3784.00 → 3785.00] That's cool.
[3785.00 → 3786.00] That's pretty cool.
[3786.00 → 3788.00] So, let's talk, oh, wait.
[3788.00 → 3791.00] I was just talking about the Oculus Rift thing, if you want to add comments.
[3791.00 → 3798.00] No, I just think that that's extremely detrimental to sort of the image that VR is going to have
[3798.00 → 3799.00] at the very beginning.
[3799.00 → 3800.00] Oh, it is.
[3800.00 → 3803.00] But at the same time, what I said is everyone should have seen this coming.
[3803.00 → 3807.00] On the other hand, it might push it to mainstream, like, right quick, fast.
[3807.00 → 3808.00] It's also possible.
[3808.00 → 3809.00] Like, POV adventure.
[3809.00 → 3814.00] Yeah, but like, okay, seriously, everyone should have seen this coming.
[3814.00 → 3816.00] They get to every medium.
[3816.00 → 3818.00] You know what, though?
[3818.00 → 3821.00] In terms of PC games, there hasn't been that much.
[3821.00 → 3822.00] They exist, though.
[3822.00 → 3823.00] Okay.
[3823.00 → 3828.00] But there's some, like, if I recall correctly, there were some experienced game devs with
[3828.00 → 3831.00] pretty impressive resumes working on this.
[3831.00 → 3832.00] Was it?
[3832.00 → 3833.00] I haven't looked into it.
[3833.00 → 3836.00] Yeah, no, I did, okay, but anyway, so, okay.
[3836.00 → 3840.00] I wanted to move on to the AMD upcoming CPUs.
[3840.00 → 3841.00] Oh, yeah.
[3841.00 → 3844.00] With the gigahertz race on again.
[3844.00 → 3847.00] AMD releasing the first five gigahertz CPU.
[3847.00 → 3850.00] I talked about it a little bit last week, so I don't know, have you heard anything about
[3850.00 → 3851.00] this?
[3851.00 → 3852.00] No.
[3852.00 → 3853.00] Okay.
[3853.00 → 3854.00] Three things.
[3854.00 → 3856.00] Number one is these are very cherry-picked.
[3856.00 → 3858.00] They are going to be extremely limited in supply.
[3858.00 → 3862.00] Number two is they are not intended to be available in the retail channel.
[3862.00 → 3863.00] Good.
[3863.00 → 3872.00] So the 9590 and the 9570 will be system builder only SKUs, much like the, oh, crap, what was
[3872.00 → 3873.00] it?
[3873.00 → 3877.00] I think it was AMD's first dual GPU card that had the ridiculous, like, handle on it.
[3877.00 → 3878.00] Yeah.
[3878.00 → 3885.00] Or, like, maybe it was, like, the like, was it, like, a 2900 XT overclocked, or an X850 XT,
[3885.00 → 3888.00] like, Platinum Edition, something like, like, AMD's done this before.
[3888.00 → 3889.00] Yeah, yeah.
[3889.00 → 3891.00] Or back then they were ATI, but whatever.
[3891.00 → 3895.00] So, anyway, they've done stuff like this before.
[3895.00 → 3898.00] And so these are going to be system builder only SKUs.
[3898.00 → 3901.00] And last but not least, check this out.
[3901.00 → 3904.00] 220 watt TDP.
[3904.00 → 3906.00] Yeah, I did know that.
[3906.00 → 3910.00] That is the most ludicrous thing that I have ever seen.
[3910.00 → 3916.00] So this was submitted on the forum by Metro P, who has linked here with his own little blurb,
[3916.00 → 3920.00] although we prefer a little bit of a longer write-up than that, guys, if you don't mind.
[3920.00 → 3923.00] And I just zoomed in, and now I'm breaking everything.
[3923.00 → 3929.00] So, anyway, Tokopedia AMD won't sell the 5 GHz and 4.7 GHz CPUs to consumers.
[3929.00 → 3930.00] Two cherry-picked?
[3930.00 → 3931.00] Yeah, two cherry-picked.
[3931.00 → 3933.00] I suspect there just aren't enough of them.
[3933.00 → 3943.00] And, not only that, but they'll ship without cooling solutions, and they will be expecting after market coolers on these things because of the extremely high 220 watt TDP.
[3943.00 → 3955.00] And the funny thing is, most of the people that have sent me messages about this seem to be under the impression that AMD is concerned about the chips not being cooled enough.
[3955.00 → 3959.00] I call bollocks on that because Intel already does it with their 6 core processors.
[3959.00 → 3962.00] All LGA 2011 processors ship with no heat sink.
[3962.00 → 3964.00] These are high TDP chips.
[3964.00 → 3968.00] They are expecting people to put an appropriate cooler on it.
[3968.00 → 3974.00] With that said, it's a different socket, and you'd expect any cooler on LGA 2011 to be appropriate for an LGA 2011 chip.
[3974.00 → 3975.00] But there are quad cores on 2011.
[3975.00 → 3979.00] There are low profile coolers that I kind of look at, and I go, seriously?
[3979.00 → 3980.00] Oh jeez.
[3980.00 → 3981.00] You know that one we have?
[3981.00 → 3982.00] Yeah.
[3982.00 → 3983.00] It's like, really?
[3983.00 → 3985.00] Maybe if the fan goes, weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
[3985.00 → 3987.00] Speaking of Noctua, who I love so dearly.
[3987.00 → 3988.00] They have a low profile cooler coming.
[3988.00 → 3989.00] It looks so sexy.
[3989.00 → 3990.00] Speaking of Noctua, we killed their website.
[3990.00 → 3991.00] It's like, double stack.
[3991.00 → 3992.00] Did we really?
[3992.00 → 3993.00] Yeah.
[3993.00 → 3994.00] Oops.
[3994.00 → 3995.00] Sorry.
[3995.00 → 3996.00] Sorry.
[3996.00 → 3998.00] Sorry.
[3998.00 → 3999.00] Sorry.
[3999.00 → 4000.00] Sorry, Jacob.
[4000.00 → 4006.00] Um, I think the problem is actually to do with the VRM on motherboards.
[4006.00 → 4009.00] Because we've seen this before with AMD.
[4009.00 → 4017.00] When they started releasing some of their high TDP black edition chips, even not 200 plus watt TDP chips.
[4017.00 → 4020.00] So remember, that is going to be pulling a ton of power.
[4020.00 → 4023.00] These are basically overclocked CPUs out of the box.
[4023.00 → 4025.00] Cherry picked and overclocked.
[4025.00 → 4027.00] Um, people were killing boards.
[4027.00 → 4030.00] Because they were putting them on consumer grade boards.
[4030.00 → 4033.00] Remember, AMD doesn't have a socket differentiation strategy.
[4033.00 → 4034.00] Which is cool.
[4034.00 → 4038.00] I believe AMD is concerned not only about consumers putting them on boards that are going to fry,
[4038.00 → 4045.00] but also motherboard manufacturers validating these chips on boards that can't handle them in the long term.
[4045.00 → 4047.00] Intel saw a ton of this.
[4047.00 → 4048.00] Yeah.
[4048.00 → 4049.00] Back in the Prescott days.
[4049.00 → 4057.00] I saw motherboards that had been running for maybe a year and a half, where the entire back of the board along the VRM was brownish black.
[4057.00 → 4058.00] Yeah.
[4058.00 → 4060.00] And they weren't even dead yet.
[4060.00 → 4067.00] They were still running, but lord only knows what kind of voltages they were delivering to the CPU by that point, how damaged they were.
[4067.00 → 4072.00] So this wouldn't be the first time that a CPU manufacturer has gone,
[4072.00 → 4078.00] okay, whoa, hold on, this chip needs a lot of power, maybe we better be really careful what kind of motherboards it's being put in.
[4078.00 → 4082.00] And I know that some of the boards that it's being validated with are things like Crosshair 5,
[4082.00 → 4087.00] where ASUS on their DOG boards overbuilds the VRM to the point where it's just kind of stupid.
[4087.00 → 4088.00] Yeah.
[4088.00 → 4089.00] But that's what they need.
[4089.00 → 4090.00] But that's what they do.
[4090.00 → 4091.00] Yeah.
[4091.00 → 4092.00] And that's what this chip needs.
[4092.00 → 4093.00] So there you go.
[4093.00 → 4095.00] That's my take on that whole thing.
[4095.00 → 4096.00] That's interesting.
[4096.00 → 4097.00] That makes sense.
[4097.00 → 4099.00] TDP, thermal design power.
[4099.00 → 4108.00] So TDP is used a little bit interchangeably with power and thermal output.
[4108.00 → 4110.00] So that is how much heat it generates.
[4110.00 → 4117.00] And the thing is that there does tend to be a correlation between the power consumption of the chip and the heat that it wastes.
[4117.00 → 4121.00] Because efficiency is efficiency across an architecture.
[4121.00 → 4131.00] And so the amount of heat that you're going to generate as waste is going to have something to do with how much power consumption that it's actually using versus how much of it gets expelled as heat.
[4131.00 → 4136.00] And part of the confusion also comes from the fact that watts are used for both heat and power.
[4136.00 → 4144.00] But TDP, strictly speaking, refers to the actual thermal output of a chip or graphics card or whatever else.
[4144.00 → 4151.00] It just happens that, like, it's funny because you look at the TDP of something like a GTX 690 versus a Radeon 7990.
[4151.00 → 4153.00] There's a 75 watt difference.
[4153.00 → 4157.00] It happens that under load, power consumption is a 75 watt difference.
[4157.00 → 4160.00] So you see where the confusion comes from.
[4160.00 → 4161.00] So, yeah.
[4161.00 → 4168.00] So 220 watt TDP means these things bust out a ton of heat, which also affects the VRM solution.
[4168.00 → 4176.00] Because even if you have a beefy VRM, if it doesn't have adequate cooling, and there's this 220 watt heating element, and that's before people overclock them.
[4176.00 → 4181.00] And TDP goes on a curve like this as you start to overclock it.
[4181.00 → 4184.00] There's a lot of heat there that can burn out VRMs as well.
[4184.00 → 4187.00] How bad are Corsair SP120s compared to NFF12s?
[4187.00 → 4188.00] I mean, they're not bad.
[4188.00 → 4192.00] They have a bit more of a ticking noise, particularly when they're undervoted.
[4192.00 → 4194.00] They don't perform as well.
[4194.00 → 4196.00] They look perfect.
[4196.00 → 4198.00] They look way better.
[4198.00 → 4200.00] I think that's where the main competition is.
[4200.00 → 4201.00] There you go.
[4201.00 → 4203.00] People don't like the look of Noctua's, but you see a lot of SP...
[4203.00 → 4206.00] That's why I'm using Gelid wings and AP-121s.
[4206.00 → 4207.00] Yeah.
[4207.00 → 4211.00] Because I can't accept the Noctua's in my personal build, which has a blue and black colour scheme.
[4211.00 → 4214.00] The interchangeable rings on SP120s are awesome.
[4214.00 → 4216.00] That was such an innovation.
[4216.00 → 4217.00] Perfect move.
[4217.00 → 4219.00] It was like the weirdest, smallest thing.
[4219.00 → 4222.00] I didn't think it mattered at first, and then I started seeing different coloured builds, and I was just like...
[4222.00 → 4225.00] They hit the nail on the head with that one. They really did.
[4225.00 → 4226.00] Yeah.
[4226.00 → 4229.00] Hey, Linus, why don't you ever talk about GTX of Funny? Because I just talked about it.
[4229.00 → 4230.00] I don't have one.
[4230.00 → 4240.00] Nvidia never sent me one, because I was literally in a delivery room when the conference call that I had to be on in order to get one was going on.
[4240.00 → 4242.00] Not delivery room as in, like, mail.
[4242.00 → 4243.00] Yeah.
[4243.00 → 4245.00] Like my baby was being born.
[4245.00 → 4252.00] So, I mean, they only have review samples when they have review samples, and it was one of those things where they were just like, dude.
[4254.00 → 4255.00] Sorry, man.
[4255.00 → 4257.00] And I was like, okay.
[4257.00 → 4258.00] Okay.
[4258.00 → 4259.00] Still can't make it, but okay.
[4259.00 → 4264.00] Other than that, we have every Nvidia GPU that they've done over the last however long.
[4264.00 → 4266.00] So, tell us more about the Omni experience.
[4266.00 → 4269.00] It was very cool, but we've talked about it a fair bit.
[4269.00 → 4273.00] We actually have an interview with Jan coming up on the Linus Tech Tips channel soon.
[4274.00 → 4277.00] Is the Asus Sonar something still relevant? Probably.
[4278.00 → 4281.00] I don't know. I can never remember what a DX or an HE or an SO are.
[4281.00 → 4283.00] Sound cards don't seem to move way too fast.
[4283.00 → 4284.00] They don't move too fast.
[4284.00 → 4286.00] Get a Sonar, you'll be happy.
[4286.00 → 4287.00] You'll be good for at least quite a while.
[4287.00 → 4289.00] Yes, I prefer single GPU cards.
[4289.00 → 4290.00] What's up with the 590 in my rig?
[4290.00 → 4291.00] I had a water block.
[4291.00 → 4292.00] I had a 590.
[4292.00 → 4295.00] And they look so good with that water block.
[4295.00 → 4297.00] And they look so good with that water block.
[4297.00 → 4299.00] Like, I use bad components.
[4300.00 → 4306.00] People ask me what's in my personal rig, and I'm almost afraid to tell them sometimes because I use stuff that just makes no sense.
[4306.00 → 4308.00] Yes, but then look at the same time.
[4308.00 → 4311.00] Look at supper, super high-end system builders.
[4311.00 → 4314.00] Like people making stuff for million-dollar PC and stuff.
[4314.00 → 4317.00] If you look at what's in the computer, it's not always that good.
[4317.00 → 4321.00] But the stuff I'm using is like balling, but like makes no sense.
[4321.00 → 4322.00] I have an extreme edition.
[4322.00 → 4323.00] Yeah.
[4323.00 → 4326.00] Like, I don't even have it overclocked that hard for it.
[4326.00 → 4327.00] That's a good point.
[4327.00 → 4334.00] I can literally get a 3930K, overclock it, and get better performance if I just spent a little bit of time tuning it.
[4334.00 → 4342.00] I have two sticks of RAM in an LGA2011 board right now because I just haven't gotten around to moving the RAM that's in that rig over there to my system.
[4342.00 → 4353.00] I have a 590, which makes not an ounce of sense because the power consumption of it, especially compared to 600 series and 7000 series, is terrible at idle.
[4353.00 → 4356.00] The amount of heat it kicks out is just devastating.
[4356.00 → 4358.00] It looks good.
[4358.00 → 4365.00] I have some ludicrous RAID card with eight SSDs in RAID 0, which I do not recommend running.
[4365.00 → 4376.00] The amount of times I've had panic moments because my computer blue screens and the RAID controller has a small breakout and loses my array and I have to swap the cables and it alarms off.
[4376.00 → 4381.00] I mean, I'm running an Kari laser, which is like a five-year-old mouse.
[4382.00 → 4386.00] I was talking to one of the guys that used to be at Bionics, and he was like, really?
[4386.00 → 4387.00] There's way better mice out there.
[4387.00 → 4391.00] And I'm like, I know, but I just love it and I can't change.
[4391.00 → 4392.00] I just can't change.
[4392.00 → 4395.00] I have it dialled in to exactly the settings I like.
[4395.00 → 4396.00] What can I do?
[4396.00 → 4397.00] Changing mice is difficult.
[4397.00 → 4398.00] It really is.
[4398.00 → 4400.00] I'm trying to change to the Death Adder 2013 right now.
[4400.00 → 4402.00] Even just form factor.
[4402.00 → 4403.00] Because, okay, I have a G500.
[4403.00 → 4404.00] Yeah.
[4404.00 → 4406.00] I know that there are problems with the lasers.
[4406.00 → 4407.00] Yeah.
[4407.00 → 4409.00] That is a very well known thing.
[4409.00 → 4411.00] So don't listen to us, basically.
[4411.00 → 4415.00] But if I put my hand on any other mouse, it's like, oh, that's, oh.
[4415.00 → 4416.00] It doesn't feel like a G500.
[4416.00 → 4417.00] Yeah.
[4417.00 → 4421.00] Like I look at like my case makes no sense.
[4421.00 → 4425.00] Like TJ07 that I've probably spent seven to eight hundred dollars on.
[4425.00 → 4428.00] And then I haven't even spent the money in ways that are like good.
[4428.00 → 4436.00] Like instead of buying like a murder mod front panel for it, I got a bunch of Aztec 900 front grills and like powder coated them.
[4437.00 → 4440.00] So that I could put another radiator in the front with like Velcro.
[4440.00 → 4441.00] Let's see.
[4441.00 → 4444.00] What else about my build makes?
[4444.00 → 4447.00] My pump is like five and a half years old.
[4447.00 → 4448.00] And you have newer ones with the same.
[4448.00 → 4450.00] And I have newer ones with the same model.
[4450.00 → 4451.00] But I was just like, oh, I don't know.
[4451.00 → 4452.00] This one's like works.
[4452.00 → 4453.00] It'll probably be fine.
[4453.00 → 4454.00] Should be fine.
[4454.00 → 4455.00] Don't worry about it.
[4455.00 → 4456.00] Hey, girl.
[4456.00 → 4457.00] Yeah.
[4457.00 → 4460.00] So I hate telling people about my rig.
[4460.00 → 4465.00] I'm running a BenQ 24-inch monitor that probably weighs as much as a CRT.
[4465.00 → 4467.00] Because it's so old.
[4467.00 → 4472.00] It's like some slow VA panel because my 30-inch monitor broke, and I don't have money to replace it.
[4472.00 → 4473.00] So, yeah.
[4473.00 → 4474.00] Bike over monitor.
[4474.00 → 4475.00] I should totally do a Kickstarter.
[4475.00 → 4477.00] Buy Linus a new monitor.
[4477.00 → 4479.00] And like, what do you want to do?
[4479.00 → 4481.00] And like, what do you get for doing it?
[4481.00 → 4482.00] You get the lamest Kickstarter ever.
[4482.00 → 4484.00] You get the self-satisfaction.
[4484.00 → 4485.00] That's horrible.
[4485.00 → 4486.00] I'm not going to do it.
[4486.00 → 4487.00] Okay.
[4487.00 → 4488.00] Um.
[4488.00 → 4489.00] Okay.
[4489.00 → 4492.00] There's people tweeting about us crashing Noctua's website.
[4492.00 → 4493.00] Sorry, Noctua.
[4493.00 → 4494.00] Sorry.
[4494.00 → 4495.00] Um.
[4495.00 → 4497.00] What do you think of trackball mice?
[4497.00 → 4498.00] No.
[4500.00 → 4501.00] We probably shouldn't get into this.
[4501.00 → 4502.00] Subjective.
[4502.00 → 4503.00] No.
[4503.00 → 4504.00] Subjective.
[4504.00 → 4505.00] Um.
[4505.00 → 4506.00] In very, very specific use cases.
[4506.00 → 4507.00] Sure.
[4507.00 → 4508.00] I think they can be very cool.
[4508.00 → 4509.00] I think we have to go.
[4509.00 → 4510.00] How long is the stream going to be?
[4510.00 → 4511.00] I'm trying to stay awake.
[4511.00 → 4512.00] It's so early in the morning.
[4512.00 → 4513.00] Thank you for trying.
[4513.00 → 4514.00] I have no idea.
[4514.00 → 4515.00] What time is it?
[4515.00 → 4516.00] I don't know when we started.
[4516.00 → 4517.00] I don't know when we started.
[4517.00 → 4518.00] I don't know what time it is.
[4518.00 → 4519.00] We're really late.
[4519.00 → 4523.00] Why don't we burn through some topics here so that we can, so we can at least end it when
[4523.00 → 4524.00] they're tired of listening to us.
[4524.00 → 4525.00] Okay.
[4525.00 → 4526.00] Um.
[4526.00 → 4527.00] We did a pretty cool article.
[4527.00 → 4528.00] Uh.
[4528.00 → 4529.00] Best CPU.
[4529.00 → 4531.00] Best gaming CPUs for the money 2013.
[4531.00 → 4533.00] Guys, check this out.
[4533.00 → 4536.00] It was submitted on the forum by, excuse me, Samuel.
[4536.00 → 4537.00] Um.
[4537.00 → 4540.00] There were a couple of things in here that I thought were a little bit suspect.
[4540.00 → 4541.00] Um.
[4541.00 → 4542.00] This is by Ian Sutras.
[4542.00 → 4543.00] I believe he's a doctor.
[4543.00 → 4545.00] So I'm going to say Dr. Sutras.
[4545.00 → 4546.00] Um.
[4546.00 → 4547.00] I actually ran into him at Computer.
[4547.00 → 4548.00] Cool.
[4548.00 → 4549.00] Yeah.
[4549.00 → 4550.00] We ran into each other in the Ass Rock booth.
[4550.00 → 4551.00] Cool.
[4551.00 → 4552.00] Um.
[4552.00 → 4555.00] I didn't think he was going to recognize me because I'd only met him once before that.
[4555.00 → 4560.00] I also ran into Anand, and we filmed an interview that all of my editors passive aggressively
[4560.00 → 4566.00] didn't edit and didn't upload because apparently I was fanboying way too hard.
[4566.00 → 4567.00] Holy cow.
[4567.00 → 4570.00] We should release it at least unedited and unlisted.
[4570.00 → 4572.00] I think we should just release it.
[4572.00 → 4574.00] I'm not ashamed to fanboy over Anand.
[4574.00 → 4575.00] He's awesome.
[4575.00 → 4576.00] It was like 40 minutes long.
[4576.00 → 4577.00] Whatever.
[4577.00 → 4578.00] 50 minutes long.
[4578.00 → 4579.00] They don't have to watch the whole thing.
[4579.00 → 4581.00] And then the walkaway was amazing too.
[4581.00 → 4582.00] I filmed part of it.
[4582.00 → 4583.00] I don't think I'm going to release this.
[4583.00 → 4584.00] But I filmed part of it.
[4584.00 → 4585.00] You filmed that?
[4585.00 → 4587.00] With the other two guys in the crew.
[4587.00 → 4590.00] Just like us all talking about you and Anand walking away.
[4590.00 → 4591.00] Whatever.
[4591.00 → 4592.00] It was fantastic.
[4592.00 → 4593.00] And then I drew like fake little love circles.
[4593.00 → 4595.00] I can think of worse people to have on it.
[4595.00 → 4597.00] I can think of worse people to have a bromance with.
[4597.00 → 4598.00] So anyway.
[4598.00 → 4600.00] So their conclusions.
[4600.00 → 4607.00] A8 5600K plus the core parking updates for Windows is their CPU for single GPU gaming.
[4607.00 → 4610.00] Can you still even get those core parking updates?
[4610.00 → 4611.00] I think so, yeah.
[4611.00 → 4612.00] Okay.
[4612.00 → 4614.00] And I think Windows 8 comes with them or something.
[4614.00 → 4615.00] Yeah.
[4615.00 → 4616.00] It's not that bad.
[4616.00 → 4618.00] So interesting choice.
[4618.00 → 4620.00] Makes a lot of sense.
[4620.00 → 4621.00] It does.
[4621.00 → 4622.00] They're overclockable.
[4622.00 → 4623.00] Yep.
[4623.00 → 4628.00] We saw going from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge to Haswell in games.
[4628.00 → 4629.00] What?
[4629.00 → 4630.00] 2, 3 FPS?
[4630.00 → 4631.00] That much.
[4631.00 → 4632.00] You won't notice it.
[4632.00 → 4633.00] That much.
[4633.00 → 4634.00] I love my 2600K.
[4634.00 → 4638.00] Pepsi challenge, TM, R, C, whatever all the things are.
[4638.00 → 4641.00] Pepsi challenge aside, like you'd never know the difference.
[4642.00 → 4643.00] Sitting down in front of them.
[4643.00 → 4645.00] Which is to me the most important thing.
[4645.00 → 4647.00] My 2600K is overclocked quite well.
[4647.00 → 4648.00] Yep.
[4648.00 → 4651.00] And I, yeah, I couldn't bring myself to the screen.
[4651.00 → 4652.00] This CPU costs next to nothing.
[4652.00 → 4653.00] Yep.
[4653.00 → 4654.00] The boards are cheap.
[4654.00 → 4655.00] Super cheap.
[4655.00 → 4656.00] FM2 boards cost nothing.
[4656.00 → 4657.00] 80, 90 bucks?
[4657.00 → 4658.00] Yes.
[4658.00 → 4659.00] For like a pretty good board.
[4659.00 → 4660.00] For a pretty good board.
[4660.00 → 4662.00] And it'll be Crossfire ready or whatever else.
[4662.00 → 4666.00] So I thought that was a fantastic, I thought that was a fantastic choice.
[4666.00 → 4669.00] Um, the next one I thought was a little bit weird.
[4669.00 → 4670.00] 2500K?
[4670.00 → 4672.00] Can you even still get these?
[4672.00 → 4673.00] 2500K?
[4673.00 → 4674.00] Yeah.
[4674.00 → 4677.00] That's actually not a bad choice though.
[4677.00 → 4678.00] Yeah, but...
[4678.00 → 4679.00] I don't know how you could get one.
[4679.00 → 4680.00] Yeah, exactly.
[4680.00 → 4682.00] Like what kind of, what kind of recommendation is that though?
[4682.00 → 4683.00] Let me see real quick.
[4683.00 → 4688.00] And FX8350 to me, really smacks of sort of trying to appease AMD here.
[4688.00 → 4694.00] Because FX8350, because games are not really going to leverage those extra cores in a meaningful way right now,
[4694.00 → 4699.00] um, is not going to perform that much better than the 5600K that they already recommended.
[4699.00 → 4702.00] Especially after you're overclocking that 5600K.
[4702.00 → 4709.00] I think it was almost reaching for like a better CPU to use for dual GPU gaming just so that they could recommend something.
[4709.00 → 4714.00] Because you still feel kind of silly putting a Titan in something like a 5600K system.
[4714.00 → 4716.00] Because it just feels inappropriate.
[4716.00 → 4719.00] But um, I mean, really 2500K?
[4719.00 → 4722.00] Yeah, it's not even listed on NCI.
[4722.00 → 4723.00] It's not listed on New egg.
[4723.00 → 4725.00] Like, where are you going to buy these?
[4725.00 → 4726.00] I mean 3500...
[4726.00 → 4728.00] For 3570K I could kind of see.
[4728.00 → 4730.00] And they do talk about that in the text blurb under it.
[4730.00 → 4732.00] But uh, yeah.
[4732.00 → 4733.00] I think it's a good choice.
[4733.00 → 4736.00] And then the next one was uh, 3770K.
[4736.00 → 4740.00] And I, I kind of had the same, I kind of had the same feeling here.
[4740.00 → 4743.00] Where the this was the triple GPU gaming CPU.
[4743.00 → 4748.00] So they're saying um, or yeah, they're saying 4770K.
[4748.00 → 4750.00] I'm not really convinced.
[4750.00 → 4751.00] Wait.
[4751.00 → 4752.00] Uh, okay.
[4752.00 → 4756.00] And then for quad GPU they say 3770K with a PLX board because...
[4756.00 → 4757.00] Yeah.
[4757.00 → 4760.00] Uh, they haven't had much experience with Z87 boards with PLX chips yet.
[4760.00 → 4761.00] Yeah.
[4761.00 → 4768.00] I mean still, I'm not convinced that a hyper-threaded CPU makes any kind of impact because you have more GPUs.
[4768.00 → 4769.00] Um.
[4769.00 → 4770.00] No.
[4770.00 → 4772.00] We've had great, great results.
[4772.00 → 4774.00] With non-hyper-threaded CPUs with multiple...
[4774.00 → 4775.00] Yeah.
[4775.00 → 4779.00] We don't test multiple graphics cards that much, which is possibly part of that.
[4779.00 → 4780.00] Right.
[4780.00 → 4781.00] Because neither of us like them.
[4781.00 → 4782.00] Yeah.
[4782.00 → 4784.00] Well, it's not so much a like or dislike thing.
[4784.00 → 4790.00] It's just, uh, it's, it's so few people that are actually running these three-way and four-way setups.
[4790.00 → 4791.00] Yeah.
[4791.00 → 4794.00] And with, uh, frame rating and all that other stuff going around.
[4794.00 → 4796.00] But on Nvidia it's relatively not a problem.
[4796.00 → 4797.00] Yeah, that's true.
[4797.00 → 4800.00] Um, I mean, and I've run SLI setups many times.
[4800.00 → 4803.00] For all of my preaching about single, that's another thing.
[4803.00 → 4807.00] For all the preaching I do about Noctua fans and single GPU setups, I'm running Gelid Wings
[4807.00 → 4810.00] and Silverstone Air Penetrators, which are both good fans too, by the way.
[4810.00 → 4812.00] And I'm running a 590.
[4812.00 → 4813.00] And, okay.
[4813.00 → 4816.00] And I ran 7900 GT SLI.
[4816.00 → 4819.00] And I ran 7950 GT SLI.
[4819.00 → 4821.00] And I ran GTX 260 SLI.
[4821.00 → 4825.00] And I ran 8800 GTS 320 gig SLI.
[4825.00 → 4828.00] And I ran...
[4828.00 → 4830.00] No, I think that was it.
[4830.00 → 4835.00] I, I, my buddy Harrison wanted a super, super, super high performance rig.
[4835.00 → 4836.00] Yeah.
[4836.00 → 4838.00] And ended up getting him to get two 660 Ti power editions.
[4838.00 → 4839.00] The original ones.
[4839.00 → 4840.00] Yes.
[4840.00 → 4841.00] And you could overclock them like crazy.
[4841.00 → 4842.00] That was a great card.
[4842.00 → 4843.00] And, like, that was a crazy card.
[4843.00 → 4844.00] Sometimes.
[4844.00 → 4846.00] And you guys slide them, and they're crazy powerful.
[4846.00 → 4847.00] Sometimes it makes a ton of sense.
[4847.00 → 4848.00] Yeah.
[4848.00 → 4849.00] So anyway guys.
[4849.00 → 4850.00] I'm just saying, like, usually you don't.
[4850.00 → 4852.00] Check out the Nantes article.
[4852.00 → 4857.00] Thank you to, uh, to Samuel for submitting that article on the forum in the news section.
[4857.00 → 4862.00] Guys, don't forget if you submit news items in the forum, there is a chance we will feature you on the live stream.
[4862.00 → 4865.00] Which, uh, we don't, it doesn't entitle you to any money.
[4865.00 → 4870.00] But that basically means you're like the rest of the Linus Media Group employees.
[4870.00 → 4875.00] It's got YouTube money, right?
[4875.00 → 4883.00] Uh, NVIDIA licenses out Kepler architecture and future GPU architectures.
[4883.00 → 4884.00] Uh, submitted by Goodbyes.
[4884.00 → 4889.00] This is also an article on Nantes, and I'm not gonna wax on about how Nantes is awesome, and I read it every day.
[4889.00 → 4895.00] Um, but, but, but, that's a preview of the interview with Anand.
[4895.00 → 4898.00] Not only do I read it every day, but I've been reading it every day for years.
[4898.00 → 4900.00] Like, I brought up stuff in the interview.
[4900.00 → 4902.00] He'd be like, yeah, something, something, something.
[4902.00 → 4904.00] I'd be like, yeah, kinda like in that article where you said this.
[4904.00 → 4907.00] And he's just like, how do you possibly?
[4907.00 → 4909.00] You really have been reading me for a long time.
[4909.00 → 4911.00] I'm like, yeah, I've read everything you've ever written.
[4911.00 → 4912.00] Um.
[4912.00 → 4914.00] You should release that interview.
[4914.00 → 4915.00] Yeah, I probably should.
[4915.00 → 4920.00] I was like, yeah, and you went through that phase where you were only interested in like home theatre crap for a while.
[4920.00 → 4922.00] And he's like, yeah, I did.
[4923.00 → 4929.00] I was like, yeah, it was hard to keep reading your articles at that time because home theatre is so far behind in Canada.
[4929.00 → 4932.00] Cause none of the providers, okay, I'm not gonna talk about Nantes anymore.
[4932.00 → 4934.00] Um, so moving on.
[4934.00 → 4936.00] So this to me is bizarre.
[4936.00 → 4944.00] So they'll be licensing out their architecture in much the same way that ARM does for its ARM architecture processors.
[4944.00 → 4946.00] What the devil does this mean?
[4946.00 → 4947.00] Go.
[4947.00 → 4950.00] I, I haven't read enough into it.
[4950.00 → 4951.00] Okay.
[4951.00 → 4952.00] That's just nutting.
[4952.00 → 4953.00] Okay.
[4953.00 → 4964.00] So are, is there potential that we could see an Intel, you know, I don't know, troll bridge CPU at some point with an Nvidia GeForce GPU in it?
[4964.00 → 4965.00] Troll bridge.
[4965.00 → 4966.00] Yes.
[4966.00 → 4967.00] And this is where I think it's interesting.
[4967.00 → 4969.00] Well, it's because I'm kind of trolling because I don't think Intel's going to do it.
[4969.00 → 4970.00] But it could.
[4970.00 → 4971.00] But could we see that?
[4971.00 → 4972.00] Someone else could as well.
[4972.00 → 4977.00] And you look at like, does this work against what Nvidia is trying to do with Terra?
[4977.00 → 4979.00] It feels like it.
[4979.00 → 4982.00] Is, are, are they shifting strategy here?
[4982.00 → 4986.00] Are they giving up on Terra where they design their own complete chip?
[4986.00 → 4989.00] But on the other hand they acquired all those wireless patents.
[4989.00 → 4994.00] So, so I, I, I, are they, are they trying to own, are they trying to spread into the ecosystem?
[4994.00 → 4996.00] Are they hedging their bets?
[4996.00 → 4998.00] Are they going, we're still committed to Terra.
[4998.00 → 5004.00] We still believe according to the code names of Terra CPUs that they are basically our superhero product.
[5004.00 → 5014.00] But are they trying to make it so that there's a possibility that a Samsung or Apple on the down low would put GeForce inside?
[5014.00 → 5020.00] Because we can all agree that Terra graphics have a lot of potential.
[5020.00 → 5022.00] And they can basically compete with themselves at this point.
[5022.00 → 5023.00] Yes.
[5023.00 → 5028.00] Which is interesting because if they're competing with themselves, they're still getting sales on both sides.
[5028.00 → 5029.00] Yes.
[5029.00 → 5031.00] Which is really, perfect.
[5031.00 → 5034.00] Like really, perfect.
[5034.00 → 5036.00] It, it opens the doors to a ton of stuff.
[5036.00 → 5039.00] It could burst money into them, which is also another thing.
[5039.00 → 5040.00] Yeah.
[5040.00 → 5041.00] It could be a really, perfect financial deal.
[5041.00 → 5043.00] Depending on how the licensing deals work.
[5043.00 → 5044.00] The licensing works, all that kind of stuff.
[5044.00 → 5045.00] Who actually buys it?
[5045.00 → 5046.00] We don't know right now.
[5046.00 → 5047.00] Like it could be amazing.
[5047.00 → 5048.00] It could not be amazing.
[5048.00 → 5049.00] I mean.
[5049.00 → 5050.00] It's interesting.
[5050.00 → 5052.00] That is just like bizarre land to me.
[5052.00 → 5053.00] It's weird.
[5053.00 → 5054.00] Did not see this coming.
[5054.00 → 5056.00] Because they've always been so closed doors.
[5056.00 → 5061.00] I mean, if they're talking about, you know, having licensing partners for the GPU tech, I
[5061.00 → 5066.00] mean, at that point, you're going to have to start sharing GPU technology before release.
[5066.00 → 5069.00] They have always been like, nope.
[5069.00 → 5074.00] Like I have a feeling that you could get killed at Nvidia for like releasing.
[5074.00 → 5075.00] I mean, okay.
[5075.00 → 5079.00] If Jensen's watching, I know you wouldn't kill anybody.
[5079.00 → 5080.00] I met him once.
[5080.00 → 5081.00] He's super cool.
[5081.00 → 5084.00] Um, but yeah.
[5084.00 → 5085.00] Yeah.
[5085.00 → 5086.00] I still though.
[5086.00 → 5087.00] That's still.
[5087.00 → 5088.00] They've always been hardcore.
[5088.00 → 5090.00] This is our technology.
[5090.00 → 5092.00] You don't mess with it.
[5092.00 → 5094.00] And, uh, I don't know.
[5094.00 → 5096.00] This is just, uh, this is, this is so bizarre.
[5096.00 → 5100.00] I mean, would they, would they, would they license it to AMD if they wanted to?
[5100.00 → 5104.00] That's one thing I was just thinking, but I don't think so.
[5104.00 → 5107.00] Because at that point, like you just said, they'd have to release stuff before the release.
[5107.00 → 5110.00] And I don't think AMD would actually want it.
[5110.00 → 5115.00] I think they take a lot of pride in what they've done with Radeon over the last little while.
[5115.00 → 5118.00] And they are like, if you look at the architectures, they're really different.
[5118.00 → 5119.00] Yes.
[5119.00 → 5120.00] They're very, very different.
[5120.00 → 5121.00] They're both graphics cards, but they're really different.
[5121.00 → 5127.00] And you look at, I mean, AMD in some ways is, is as ahead of the curve as they've ever
[5127.00 → 5129.00] been in terms of the tech.
[5129.00 → 5130.00] Do they have a competitor for Titan?
[5130.00 → 5134.00] No, but that was never their strategy.
[5134.00 → 5137.00] No, not in the not since they did 3870.
[5137.00 → 5139.00] Has that been their strategy?
[5139.00 → 5143.00] The high end is meant to be addressed by two dual, by a dual GPU card.
[5143.00 → 5146.00] So, so yeah, so there's, so there's that.
[5146.00 → 5151.00] You look at how far ahead they are in terms of open CL performance, which is going to be
[5151.00 → 5153.00] much, very relevant moving forward.
[5153.00 → 5154.00] That's going to be a big deal.
[5154.00 → 5161.00] And it feels like, I mean, particularly with Adobe moving to open CL, it feels like that
[5161.00 → 5163.00] battle is going to be interesting.
[5163.00 → 5164.00] Yeah.
[5164.00 → 5165.00] Open CL versus CUBA.
[5165.00 → 5171.00] Look at how competitive six or 7000 series still is, even though it launched before.
[5171.00 → 5173.00] This is something a lot of people forget.
[5173.00 → 5175.00] 7000 series is old.
[5175.00 → 5179.00] People ask me all the time, Minus, why don't you ever do any coverage of AMD GPUs?
[5179.00 → 5182.00] Well, because they haven't freaking released anything in a long time.
[5182.00 → 5188.00] Because 7000 series was before 600 series and Nvidia is refreshing to 700 series already.
[5188.00 → 5189.00] And they didn't get us a 7,990.
[5189.00 → 5192.00] And they didn't get it, but we have one now.
[5192.00 → 5195.00] The unboxing is shot, and it'll be up soon.
[5195.00 → 5196.00] So there you go.
[5196.00 → 5197.00] So that means I get to...
[5197.00 → 5199.00] And we got a 7790 finally.
[5199.00 → 5202.00] I don't know if there's any point in us benchmarking it.
[5202.00 → 5205.00] Because we don't have a frame rating set up.
[5205.00 → 5206.00] Right.
[5206.00 → 5207.00] I don't know.
[5207.00 → 5210.00] So we'll discuss internally and see what we think makes sense.
[5210.00 → 5215.00] But, yeah, I mean, they're really ahead.
[5215.00 → 5217.00] They're really advanced in a way that...
[5217.00 → 5218.00] And I think it would be a pride thing.
[5218.00 → 5224.00] I don't think AMD would want to take, you know, yeah, help from the green team.
[5224.00 → 5228.00] Then again, I'm not going to speak for AMD's executives.
[5228.00 → 5230.00] There would be interesting technologies at the same time.
[5230.00 → 5232.00] Like, they're trying to get...
[5232.00 → 5233.00] Oh, man.
[5233.00 → 5236.00] Why can't I remember the name of it right now?
[5236.00 → 5237.00] Dress FX?
[5237.00 → 5238.00] Yeah.
[5238.00 → 5239.00] The hair thing?
[5239.00 → 5243.00] They might be able to pull in help by getting some of the technologies from Phys.
[5243.00 → 5244.00] Okay.
[5244.00 → 5245.00] So I don't know.
[5245.00 → 5246.00] Again, pride thing.
[5246.00 → 5250.00] Which is, honestly, as a company, I wouldn't want to be like, hey, we want to, like, figure
[5250.00 → 5251.00] out...
[5251.00 → 5253.00] Yeah, we're going to start, you know, pushing Phys.
[5253.00 → 5254.00] Yeah.
[5254.00 → 5256.00] That doesn't seem like the right move and I don't think they'll do it.
[5256.00 → 5259.00] I just can't imagine AMD putting anything green on their box.
[5259.00 → 5260.00] Yeah.
[5260.00 → 5261.00] No.
[5261.00 → 5263.00] They even moved away from it on the AMD CPU side.
[5263.00 → 5264.00] Yeah.
[5264.00 → 5265.00] Nope, nope.
[5265.00 → 5266.00] Our performance stuff is all red.
[5266.00 → 5267.00] Yeah.
[5267.00 → 5268.00] Done.
[5268.00 → 5269.00] Okay.
[5269.00 → 5271.00] Um, how are the Angel bird internal SSDs?
[5271.00 → 5272.00] Any good?
[5272.00 → 5274.00] They're Sand force SSDs, so they couldn't be bad.
[5274.00 → 5280.00] Um, so far, just based on the sort of fit and finish of this, I would say their attention
[5280.00 → 5282.00] to detail and quality is outstanding.
[5282.00 → 5283.00] And it's been doing great.
[5283.00 → 5284.00] We've actually used it a lot.
[5284.00 → 5285.00] Yeah, we've used it a ton.
[5285.00 → 5286.00] We're using it all day today.
[5286.00 → 5287.00] Um, please do a guide on the T-Balancer.
[5287.00 → 5288.00] Yeah, I know.
[5288.00 → 5291.00] It's for like seven people that need one.
[5291.00 → 5293.00] Um, other than mice causing pregnancy.
[5293.00 → 5294.00] Oh, shoot.
[5294.00 → 5295.00] You guys can't see Twitter right now.
[5295.00 → 5296.00] I'm sorry.
[5296.00 → 5302.00] Uh, let's just say your personal rig is full of things that you take risks on day to day.
[5302.00 → 5303.00] Yes, I do.
[5303.00 → 5308.00] What do you think about Omni and the Elder Scrolls guy working together to make...
[5308.00 → 5309.00] Okay.
[5309.00 → 5311.00] What do you think about Omni and Elder Scrolls?
[5311.00 → 5313.00] Would you play Elder Scrolls with an Omni?
[5313.00 → 5315.00] Uh, if I want to become a marathon runner.
[5315.00 → 5316.00] True that.
[5316.00 → 5317.00] Okay.
[5317.00 → 5318.00] Fast travel, I guess.
[5318.00 → 5319.00] Yeah, but I...
[5319.00 → 5321.00] Okay, I don't want to get into this.
[5321.00 → 5322.00] I'll talk for too long.
[5322.00 → 5323.00] Okay.
[5323.00 → 5325.00] Ivy Bridge uses a very cheap thermal solution under the IHS.
[5325.00 → 5326.00] 2500K is great.
[5326.00 → 5327.00] Good for you.
[5327.00 → 5328.00] But you can't buy one.
[5328.00 → 5329.00] That's what we were talking about.
[5329.00 → 5330.00] He...
[5330.00 → 5331.00] I think...
[5331.00 → 5333.00] I think I saw that tweet too.
[5333.00 → 5334.00] I have one at 5G.
[5334.00 → 5335.00] Oh.
[5335.00 → 5336.00] So he has one already.
[5336.00 → 5337.00] Okay.
[5337.00 → 5338.00] So he's not trying to buy one.
[5338.00 → 5339.00] Oh.
[5339.00 → 5340.00] And you can technically buy them on eBay.
[5340.00 → 5343.00] That's not really relevant for a 2013 buyer's guide though.
[5343.00 → 5344.00] Definitely not.
[5344.00 → 5345.00] Okay.
[5345.00 → 5346.00] But...
[5346.00 → 5347.00] Dell.
[5347.00 → 5349.00] U3011 is worth $1400.
[5349.00 → 5350.00] Depends on what you're doing.
[5350.00 → 5351.00] Um...
[5351.00 → 5352.00] Are you a professional user?
[5352.00 → 5353.00] Yeah.
[5353.00 → 5354.00] Are you a professional...
[5354.00 → 5355.00] Well...
[5355.00 → 5356.00] Yeah.
[5356.00 → 5357.00] Are you a professional user who can't quite afford an ISO?
[5357.00 → 5358.00] EGO?
[5358.00 → 5359.00] How much are I?
[5359.00 → 5360.00] ISO?
[5360.00 → 5361.00] I don't know.
[5361.00 → 5362.00] Super expensive.
[5362.00 → 5363.00] I don't...
[5363.00 → 5364.00] I've never even looked into it.
[5364.00 → 5365.00] Yeah.
[5365.00 → 5366.00] I know...
[5366.00 → 5367.00] I know more than one person that has that monitor because it's amazingly good.
[5367.00 → 5368.00] Yeah.
[5368.00 → 5369.00] I know some graphic designers.
[5369.00 → 5371.00] I bought a 2405 FPW back in the day.
[5371.00 → 5374.00] I picked one up used for $750 or $800 bucks.
[5374.00 → 5377.00] Like, that was the most expensive monitor I've ever bought.
[5377.00 → 5378.00] Even my 30 inch.
[5378.00 → 5380.00] I only spent around $650 bucks on it.
[5380.00 → 5381.00] Um...
[5381.00 → 5382.00] Dell monitors are outstanding.
[5382.00 → 5383.00] Yeah.
[5383.00 → 5387.00] That 2405 FPW, that's an 05 model, is still running.
[5388.00 → 5389.00] And it's starting to fade.
[5389.00 → 5392.00] It's been fading for about a year, but it's still on my wife's desk.
[5392.00 → 5394.00] So, I believe in Dell monitors.
[5394.00 → 5395.00] I'll just put it that way.
[5395.00 → 5396.00] They're really, really, perfect.
[5396.00 → 5397.00] I don't know.
[5397.00 → 5398.00] I have a normal experience.
[5398.00 → 5399.00] Best CPU for 3D rendering and rendering in general?
[5399.00 → 5401.00] I have a 6 core 1090T.
[5401.00 → 5406.00] I mean, 3930K is what I would go.
[5406.00 → 5407.00] Um...
[5408.00 → 5410.00] I think I accidentally scrolled up or something.
[5410.00 → 5413.00] Most embarrassing moment at Computer.
[5413.00 → 5415.00] Was it all the booth babes trying to take pictures with you?
[5415.00 → 5416.00] Yeah, probably.
[5416.00 → 5417.00] That's weird.
[5417.00 → 5419.00] Never happened to me, so...
[5419.00 → 5420.00] I guess, uh...
[5420.00 → 5421.00] I guess that's not a thing.
[5421.00 → 5423.00] We didn't even release the video of the best one.
[5423.00 → 5424.00] Oh, really?
[5424.00 → 5425.00] Oh, that...
[5425.00 → 5426.00] No, it got lost.
[5426.00 → 5427.00] Oh, did it?
[5427.00 → 5428.00] Yeah, it glitched out.
[5428.00 → 5429.00] Ahhhh.
[5429.00 → 5433.00] I pulled the USB drive out of the computer without safely removing, and the file...
[5433.00 → 5434.00] Ohhhh.
[5434.00 → 5435.00] Yeah.
[5435.00 → 5436.00] That one was the best one.
[5436.00 → 5438.00] Oh, B-roll was like, choked.
[5438.00 → 5439.00] So choked.
[5439.00 → 5440.00] He was like...
[5440.00 → 5442.00] I wanted that too.
[5442.00 → 5444.00] I know, I'm sorry.
[5444.00 → 5445.00] It was my bad.
[5445.00 → 5446.00] It was my bad.
[5446.00 → 5448.00] Well, I don't safely remove flash drives either.
[5448.00 → 5449.00] Yeah.
[5449.00 → 5450.00] I can't be that mad.
[5450.00 → 5451.00] You could've just as easily done it.
[5451.00 → 5452.00] Yeah, I can't be that mad.
[5452.00 → 5453.00] Yeah.
[5453.00 → 5454.00] Because he does.
[5454.00 → 5455.00] And he does.
[5455.00 → 5456.00] He does.
[5456.00 → 5457.00] We don't have time.
[5457.00 → 5458.00] We're just like, ah, let's go.
[5458.00 → 5459.00] Go!
[5459.00 → 5460.00] Go!
[5460.00 → 5463.00] The files are of lesser importance than getting this USB drive out as quickly as we can.
[5463.00 → 5464.00] I closed...
[5464.00 → 5465.00] Yeah, that's broken.
[5465.00 → 5466.00] That's like, definitely broken.
[5466.00 → 5467.00] Oh, okay.
[5467.00 → 5470.00] Well, we tried to go to this link, but here you go, guys.
[5470.00 → 5474.00] China now has the world's fastest supercomputer by a long friggin' shot.
[5474.00 → 5476.00] Titan has been surpassed.
[5476.00 → 5481.00] So NVIDIA's going to have to redo all of their marketing around the world's fastest supercomputer and the Titan GPU.
[5481.00 → 5485.00] I mean, it was the world's fastest supercomputer and that whole thing is just a leapfrog race.
[5485.00 → 5487.00] Oh yeah, insanely fast too.
[5487.00 → 5488.00] Yeah.
[5488.00 → 5489.00] And Titan's still fast, don't worry.
[5489.00 → 5494.00] And I mean, China's approach was to throw, what was it, like something like a million plus CPUs at the problem?
[5494.00 → 5495.00] I'm trying to get to it.
[5495.00 → 5502.00] They built their own interconnect to communicate from like node to node and the thing is friggin' beast.
[5502.00 → 5512.00] And it's basically part of China's initiative to be, to have their own IT resources that are just friggin' boss.
[5512.00 → 5517.00] Because when China decides to do something and like, do it hardcore, like look at the Beijing Olympics.
[5517.00 → 5519.00] Everything about it was like, awesome.
[5519.00 → 5527.00] Like, I honestly, living in Vancouver, I just felt embarrassed by things like our opening ceremonies compared to the Beijing one.
[5527.00 → 5531.00] Just like, everything was embarrassing compared to just China's hardcore.
[5531.00 → 5539.00] So, blah, blah, blah, they use, so they're not using their own CPUs, although there are, the, the, the, the, the, the.
[5539.00 → 5547.00] So, yeah, this is, so super, so Titan is just over half of the power of the new, whatever it's called, Titan.
[5547.00 → 5549.00] Not power draw.
[5549.00 → 5554.00] Yeah, power in terms of like, yeah, gun show time.
[5554.00 → 5560.00] So, also known as Milky Way 2, consists of 16,000 nodes inside each node.
[5560.00 → 5571.00] Two Intel Leon Ivy Bridge processors and three Intel Leon Phi processors run the show, adding up to a total of 3.12 million computing cores.
[5571.00 → 5576.00] Okay, then, the machine is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of this year.
[5576.00 → 5581.00] It's something, something, something, so most of the features of the system were developed in China.
[5581.00 → 5583.00] They're using only Intel for the main compute part.
[5583.00 → 5589.00] However, the Interconnect operating system, front-end processors, and software are mainly Chinese.
[5589.00 → 5591.00] Very interesting.
[5591.00 → 5593.00] And the Chinese are looking into making their own processors, right?
[5593.00 → 5594.00] Yeah.
[5594.00 → 5596.00] Like, like, large, large scale.
[5596.00 → 5598.00] In fact, there are...
[5600.00 → 5601.00] Something, where are they?
[5601.00 → 5603.00] Something, something, something, something, something.
[5603.00 → 5604.00] Ah, I can't find it.
[5604.00 → 5612.00] I think there are some Chinese processors in there that they're not even factoring into the power of it from, like, a top 500 supercomputer perspective.
[5612.00 → 5616.00] And it's more specialized for, like, weather predictions or something.
[5616.00 → 5617.00] Oh, interesting.
[5617.00 → 5619.00] I'm pretty sure I read that.
[5619.00 → 5620.00] Anyway.
[5620.00 → 5621.00] This could be a slightly different article.
[5621.00 → 5626.00] I think I clicked on another link within the article and I kind of kept reading about it because I was interested in it.
[5626.00 → 5627.00] But there you go.
[5627.00 → 5636.00] China, dominant in terms of world's fastest, but I think the US still has something ludicrous, like 200 of the top 500 supercomputers, and China has, like, 70 or something like that.
[5636.00 → 5641.00] So it's still, it's still the US, the US show in terms of super computing.
[5641.00 → 5647.00] And let's do Build of the Week, and then I think we're pretty much going to do another Twitter Blitz and wrap this up, folks.
[5647.00 → 5648.00] Build of the Week is a...
[5648.00 → 5649.00] You're up.
[5649.00 → 5650.00] Uh, oh, okay.
[5650.00 → 5652.00] I did a PowerPoint for it.
[5652.00 → 5653.00] Oh, where is it?
[5653.00 → 5654.00] This works.
[5654.00 → 5655.00] It's in the Google Drive.
[5655.00 → 5656.00] Alright, Google Drive.
[5656.00 → 5658.00] Oh, you're showing the Google Drive.
[5658.00 → 5659.00] Whatever.
[5659.00 → 5661.00] Um, what's it called?
[5661.00 → 5663.00] Uh, today's, try today's date with dashes.
[5663.00 → 5664.00] Today's date with dashes?
[5664.00 → 5666.00] Are you, what are you, I?
[5666.00 → 5668.00] I didn't mean type in today.
[5668.00 → 5671.00] 6-21-2013?
[5671.00 → 5672.00] Really?
[5672.00 → 5673.00] Oh, really?
[5673.00 → 5674.00] Yeah.
[5674.00 → 5675.00] Ugh.
[5675.00 → 5676.00] And it's going to look like...
[5676.00 → 5678.00] And your naming thing for the file earlier?
[5678.00 → 5681.00] I was like, yeah, three numbers, that's perfect.
[5681.00 → 5683.00] Alright, so here we go, wow!
[5683.00 → 5684.00] Did we see this?
[5684.00 → 5685.00] I saw that.
[5685.00 → 5687.00] We saw this, yeah, I saw this at Computer.
[5687.00 → 5690.00] Yeah, and it's in, it's in a video that we did of the ECS booth.
[5690.00 → 5691.00] Is this on our forum?
[5691.00 → 5693.00] This is, she posted it on our forum.
[5693.00 → 5694.00] No!
[5694.00 → 5696.00] I told her to while she was there, because there was the five mod men competition, right?
[5696.00 → 5697.00] Yeah.
[5697.00 → 5699.00] She was the only one actively standing by her computer.
[5699.00 → 5700.00] Really?
[5700.00 → 5701.00] And actively talking about her computer.
[5701.00 → 5703.00] So I was like, you should post this on our forum, you'll get tons of traffic.
[5703.00 → 5705.00] She ended up winning a Community Choice Award.
[5705.00 → 5706.00] Cool!
[5706.00 → 5709.00] Which is awesome, and I think, largely driven by our fans.
[5709.00 → 5710.00] Sweet!
[5710.00 → 5711.00] Because it's in our video.
[5711.00 → 5712.00] And that's really, really cool.
[5712.00 → 5713.00] The power supply's in the bottom.
[5713.00 → 5716.00] It's all, she's a gold and silversmith.
[5716.00 → 5717.00] Oh!
[5717.00 → 5718.00] Is it silver?
[5718.00 → 5719.00] No, it's aluminum.
[5719.00 → 5720.00] Oh, okay.
[5720.00 → 5723.00] Um, but like, she has the tools to do that kind of stuff.
[5723.00 → 5724.00] So, what's this?
[5724.00 → 5725.00] Oh, that's the other build of the week.
[5725.00 → 5726.00] Okay.
[5726.00 → 5728.00] So, where do they go to get the links for build of the week?
[5728.00 → 5732.00] The links for this will be in, I'll tweet them out right now, they will be in a forum
[5732.00 → 5738.00] topic on the top of build logs, made by winspeed36, so you'll be able to find these later on.
[5738.00 → 5741.00] Um, he will add them there, and I'll tweet these out.
[5741.00 → 5742.00] But they're both totally awesome.
[5742.00 → 5744.00] This one is user FAT.
[5744.00 → 5747.00] You can find her on the forum, you can check the build logs thread.
[5747.00 → 5749.00] She's still, I think, page one or two.
[5749.00 → 5751.00] And that thing is very, very, very cool.
[5751.00 → 5753.00] Alright, next up.
[5753.00 → 5760.00] This is user RJF049 with the most creative name I've ever seen.
[5760.00 → 5762.00] And it's on a test bench.
[5762.00 → 5765.00] But it's fascinating, I really, really suggest checking out the thread, because while
[5765.00 → 5770.00] this is the most, um, like, pulled out video, uh, picture I could see that really showed
[5770.00 → 5773.00] the whole build, you should really, really see the closer up pictures, because he's got
[5773.00 → 5774.00] really nice sleeving.
[5774.00 → 5777.00] Look at that individually sleeved cabling, it's like perfect.
[5777.00 → 5778.00] Super nice sleeving.
[5778.00 → 5779.00] Yeah.
[5779.00 → 5781.00] Um, and he sleeved his tubes.
[5781.00 → 5782.00] Oh, I've done that.
[5782.00 → 5783.00] And it looks perfect.
[5783.00 → 5784.00] It looks outstanding, yeah.
[5784.00 → 5785.00] It looks really, perfect.
[5785.00 → 5787.00] The test bench is way too big.
[5787.00 → 5788.00] Pfft, I see that.
[5788.00 → 5791.00] It's way too big, and it's a lot bigger.
[5791.00 → 5793.00] That's an HPTX, uh...
[5793.00 → 5797.00] It's one of the, uh, ah, what am I, not Coolie, um...
[5797.00 → 5798.00] Um, Dumas Tech?
[5798.00 → 5799.00] No.
[5799.00 → 5800.00] No.
[5800.00 → 5801.00] No, they do, like, pots or whatever.
[5801.00 → 5802.00] The Fear It think.
[5802.00 → 5803.00] Oh, Phobia.
[5803.00 → 5806.00] Yeah, it's a Phobia test bench, and it's absolutely massive, and...
[5806.00 → 5807.00] I mean, how many slots is this?
[5807.00 → 5808.00] He doesn't use it at all.
[5808.00 → 5813.00] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, like, is that eleven?
[5813.00 → 5814.00] What kind of motherboard does this...
[5814.00 → 5815.00] Okay, anyway.
[5815.00 → 5816.00] Whatever you want.
[5816.00 → 5817.00] Yeah, whatever you want.
[5817.00 → 5818.00] But it's a really, really cool build.
[5818.00 → 5819.00] I've said really, really a ton.
[5819.00 → 5820.00] Um, you do say that a ton.
[5820.00 → 5821.00] Um, I do.
[5821.00 → 5822.00] I fall back on it because...
[5822.00 → 5823.00] You really, really, really do.
[5823.00 → 5826.00] If I say really, really, or very, very, it buys me time so I can figure out what I'm
[5826.00 → 5827.00] going to say next.
[5827.00 → 5828.00] Look how dark we are now.
[5828.00 → 5831.00] Yeah, because it's dimming outside.
[5831.00 → 5832.00] Yeah.
[5832.00 → 5835.00] Um, anyway, guys, check out the builds of the week.
[5835.00 → 5836.00] They're awesome as usual.
[5836.00 → 5837.00] We will be back.
[5837.00 → 5839.00] Oh, no, I said we would do a Twitter Blitz.
[5839.00 → 5841.00] Okay, guys, Twitter Blitz time.
[5841.00 → 5842.00] Slick.
[5842.00 → 5843.00] Thoughts on Elder Scrolls Online coming to consoles?
[5843.00 → 5844.00] No.
[5844.00 → 5845.00] We're not talking about that.
[5845.00 → 5850.00] Um, if you want to talk about that, we'll talk about that later in some medium.
[5850.00 → 5852.00] Either message me on the forum or start a thread or something, I'll show up.
[5852.00 → 5855.00] My PC and everything in it is four slash five years old.
[5855.00 → 5857.00] Is it worth upgrading over time?
[5857.00 → 5858.00] Save for a new build.
[5858.00 → 5859.00] Do that thing.
[5859.00 → 5860.00] Save for a new build.
[5860.00 → 5863.00] It is pretty much always a better choice.
[5864.00 → 5867.00] Will you autograph my side panel if I send it to you?
[5867.00 → 5870.00] That's not really a service we offer.
[5870.00 → 5874.00] Um, honestly, I think you'll be amazed at how expensive it is to-
[5874.00 → 5875.00] Oh, it is expensive.
[5875.00 → 5879.00] I shipped a motherboard to Australia today, and it was $90.
[5879.00 → 5881.00] And that was going through-
[5881.00 → 5884.00] Through the shipping rates that are available at NCI.
[5884.00 → 5885.00] I called in a favour.
[5885.00 → 5889.00] Which is not how much it would have cost if we went normally.
[5889.00 → 5891.00] Yeah, it was like $250, FedEx quoted us.
[5891.00 → 5892.00] Yeah.
[5892.00 → 5894.00] Uh, should I get a H80i or a H100i?
[5894.00 → 5895.00] Get a H100i.
[5895.00 → 5900.00] Haswell E, X99, LGA20113, any news?
[5900.00 → 5901.00] Not really?
[5901.00 → 5903.00] I mean, Ivy Bridge E isn't out yet.
[5903.00 → 5907.00] So, what's up with the PS4 saying it will have DDR5 RAM?
[5907.00 → 5913.00] It has GDDR5 RAM, and it shares that graphics memory, which the main differences between graphics
[5913.00 → 5917.00] memory and system memory are so that it's higher latency and typically higher clock speeds.
[5917.00 → 5920.00] Um, it's going to share that as system memory.
[5920.00 → 5923.00] This is something we've never seen before and everyone is very interested to see how that goes.
[5923.00 → 5924.00] Yeah.
[5924.00 → 5926.00] Are closed loop water coolers generally loud?
[5926.00 → 5930.00] No, but the H60, if you want to overclock, could potentially be.
[5930.00 → 5933.00] Get a H100i or an H110 if you want something really quiet.
[5933.00 → 5934.00] Yeah.
[5934.00 → 5935.00] Do you want to do a few?
[5935.00 → 5937.00] Uh, should I push-pull a heat sink with two different fans?
[5937.00 → 5938.00] No.
[5938.00 → 5942.00] Compression loss-lossy?
[5942.00 → 5945.00] Lossless versus uncompressed files in terms of video audio photos.
[5945.00 → 5948.00] Uh, uncompressed as far as I know.
[5948.00 → 5949.00] It's better.
[5949.00 → 5951.00] I'm not really sure what the question is.
[5951.00 → 5952.00] Yeah, okay, moving on.
[5952.00 → 5953.00] Um, are we?
[5953.00 → 5954.00] I think so.
[5954.00 → 5955.00] We haven't finished yet.
[5955.00 → 5956.00] We're close.
[5956.00 → 5957.00] Okay.
[5957.00 → 5958.00] Okay.
[5958.00 → 5959.00] Okay.
[5959.00 → 5960.00] Is there going to be an after-
[5960.00 → 5961.00] Yes.
[5961.00 → 5962.00] H- uh, H100i.
[5962.00 → 5963.00] H100i.
[5963.00 → 5966.00] If you can fit a H100i, do a H100i.
[5966.00 → 5968.00] Anything new on Nvidia Shadow play?
[5968.00 → 5969.00] Not that I've heard.
[5969.00 → 5970.00] I'm excited.
[5970.00 → 5972.00] Yeah, they're still saying it's coming in the summer sometime.
[5972.00 → 5973.00] Yeah, super excited.
[5973.00 → 5974.00] Uh...
[5974.00 → 5977.00] Presumably Seagate or Western Digital?
[5977.00 → 5978.00] Yeah.
[5978.00 → 5980.00] Yeah, they probably have a perfect deal, actually.
[5980.00 → 5985.00] Is the Haswell on the same line as Intel's Extreme Edition?
[5985.00 → 5988.00] They are using different processor architectures.
[5988.00 → 5992.00] Um, and they are-they have a different number of cores.
[5992.00 → 5994.00] And they're on different platforms.
[5994.00 → 5997.00] Um, performance however is pretty similar.
[5997.00 → 5998.00] Particularly for gaming.
[5998.00 → 6001.00] Not for things like 3D rendering or more professional work.
[6001.00 → 6004.00] Pros and cons of upgrading to a 120Hz monitor.
[6004.00 → 6005.00] Specifically, I'm a gamer.
[6005.00 → 6006.00] Go.
[6006.00 → 6008.00] Do you want like-ugh.
[6008.00 → 6009.00] Are you going for 3D?
[6009.00 → 6012.00] Like, um, this kind of question, I would throw this on the forum.
[6012.00 → 6015.00] Because you can get a lot more in depth than what we're going to get it to now.
[6015.00 → 6017.00] We need to know more of what you're doing.
[6017.00 → 6018.00] Like, yes, you're a gamer.
[6018.00 → 6019.00] But we need to know like, what games.
[6019.00 → 6020.00] What you want to do with it.
[6020.00 → 6021.00] All that kind of stuff.
[6021.00 → 6022.00] So I would recommend posting on the forum.
[6022.00 → 6025.00] Will, and can you do a build video for around 3,000?
[6025.00 → 6026.00] We aren't really planning on that right now.
[6026.00 → 6029.00] But I do have a call with Intel this coming week.
[6029.00 → 6033.00] Where we're going to discuss what we're doing for our next Intel sponsored build guide.
[6033.00 → 6036.00] You can buy new ones.
[6036.00 → 6037.00] Apparently on Amazon.
[6037.00 → 6038.00] Cool.
[6038.00 → 6039.00] Okay.
[6039.00 → 6041.00] It's 230 bucks though.
[6041.00 → 6042.00] Yeah, that's not even a good deal.
[6042.00 → 6043.00] No.
[6043.00 → 6044.00] Okay.
[6044.00 → 6046.00] I'm making an 8 SSD rate array.
[6046.00 → 6048.00] Should I set up a RAM disk?
[6048.00 → 6049.00] Probably not.
[6049.00 → 6052.00] I mean, you can use, um, fancy cache.
[6052.00 → 6053.00] Okay.
[6053.00 → 6055.00] But I think it's still in beta or something.
[6055.00 → 6056.00] Yeah.
[6056.00 → 6057.00] Like, it's one of those things where, yeah, sure, go for it.
[6057.00 → 6058.00] I'd do it.
[6058.00 → 6059.00] But I still wouldn't recommend it.
[6059.00 → 6061.00] All that stuff is a little bit sketch right now.
[6061.00 → 6062.00] But it's fun.
[6062.00 → 6063.00] So, whatever you want to do.
[6063.00 → 6068.00] Well, with the new consoles, how much of the 8 core CPU label will translate into performance
[6068.00 → 6071.00] and how much is just marketing speak?
[6071.00 → 6073.00] I think we'll see when it comes out.
[6073.00 → 6076.00] It depends on how optimized the games are for multicore.
[6076.00 → 6077.00] Yeah.
[6077.00 → 6078.00] Because these are not powerful cores.
[6078.00 → 6079.00] Nope.
[6079.00 → 6082.00] But people are going to be, they optimize like crazy for console.
[6082.00 → 6083.00] Yeah.
[6083.00 → 6086.00] Like, I remember when, um, jumping back to this.
[6086.00 → 6090.00] When they were making Borrowing, they had to move the data that was going to be read more
[6090.00 → 6093.00] closer in the disk so that it could be read faster.
[6093.00 → 6094.00] Oh.
[6094.00 → 6095.00] Oh.
[6095.00 → 6096.00] Excuse me.
[6096.00 → 6097.00] Ah.
[6097.00 → 6098.00] Sorry.
[6098.00 → 6100.00] Will you do a review of the H630?
[6100.00 → 6102.00] Yeah, we actually have one sitting downstairs.
[6102.00 → 6104.00] We just haven't gotten around to it yet.
[6104.00 → 6106.00] Good morning from Israel.
[6106.00 → 6107.00] Hello.
[6107.00 → 6108.00] Hello.
[6108.00 → 6109.00] Good morning.
[6109.00 → 6110.00] Good morning.
[6110.00 → 6111.00] Good morning.
[6111.00 → 6115.00] Do you recommend two 670s or single 770 slash 780?
[6115.00 → 6116.00] Go.
[6116.00 → 6117.00] 780.
[6117.00 → 6118.00] Okay.
[6118.00 → 6119.00] Agreed.
[6119.00 → 6121.00] What would you recommend for a SAD with decent storage and good speed?
[6121.00 → 6125.00] Well, I'd recommend you watch us on your computer and not on your phone for one thing,
[6125.00 → 6126.00] if you want to type correctly.
[6126.00 → 6130.00] Just, ah, SSD with good storage and good speed.
[6130.00 → 6133.00] I don't know, anything from Samsung, Intel, crucial.
[6133.00 → 6138.00] Quite frankly, the Neutron GTX from Corsair is getting rave reviews these days.
[6138.00 → 6140.00] There's a lot of really solid stuff right now.
[6140.00 → 6141.00] Yeah.
[6141.00 → 6142.00] It's not moving super quickly right now.
[6142.00 → 6144.00] Seagate's new stuff is outstanding.
[6144.00 → 6146.00] I mean, you look at how much it's slowed down.
[6146.00 → 6151.00] Sand force SATA 3 is still very relevant, very competitive.
[6151.00 → 6152.00] Yep.
[6152.00 → 6153.00] So, yeah.
[6153.00 → 6156.00] DDR3, DDR5, and the PS4, we already talked about this.
[6156.00 → 6160.00] Gaming monitor 3x23 inch or 21x9 27 inch.
[6160.00 → 6164.00] Both are IPS, 5 millisecond response time, and both solutions are around $600.
[6164.00 → 6165.00] Go.
[6165.00 → 6166.00] So, wait.
[6166.00 → 6169.00] Is he doing one 27 inch or three 23 inch?
[6169.00 → 6175.00] One 21x9 super widescreen 27 inch or three 23-inch monitors in surround.
[6176.00 → 6180.00] Remember we saw one today, the Alienware one.
[6180.00 → 6181.00] Yeah.
[6181.00 → 6183.00] I don't like that, personally.
[6183.00 → 6187.00] I would really recommend trying to go to a store where you can see it in person.
[6187.00 → 6193.00] I find it is very flat, whereas to be an equal distance away from the monitor, you almost...
[6193.00 → 6194.00] A bit of a curvature.
[6194.00 → 6195.00] You almost need some curvature there.
[6195.00 → 6199.00] And we've seen some kind of stuff like that from, I don't remember who, but they made this
[6199.00 → 6201.00] giant curved monitor which was realistically three monitors.
[6201.00 → 6202.00] Right.
[6202.00 → 6203.00] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[6203.00 → 6207.00] My friend needs to format a spare OS drive on Windows, just won't let him format it.
[6207.00 → 6208.00] Any tools to format it.
[6208.00 → 6209.00] Yeah, F disk.
[6209.00 → 6211.00] Within Windows, you can actually force it.
[6211.00 → 6212.00] Yeah.
[6212.00 → 6213.00] Linus...
[6213.00 → 6215.00] Oh, I already got that one.
[6215.00 → 6217.00] I already got that one a few times, I think.
[6217.00 → 6225.00] Can you recommend the Silverstone PS07 or another greater than $70 US case?
[6225.00 → 6228.00] Make an ultimate silence build with Noctua NT balancer?
[6228.00 → 6229.00] You know what?
[6229.00 → 6232.00] I'm not that familiar with the PS07, unfortunately.
[6232.00 → 6234.00] So, I'm sorry.
[6234.00 → 6235.00] What does...
[6235.00 → 6237.00] Okay, we already talked about that.
[6237.00 → 6238.00] Already talked about that.
[6238.00 → 6239.00] Asus Bamboo, really?
[6239.00 → 6242.00] He asked me what laptop I had.
[6242.00 → 6243.00] Oh!
[6243.00 → 6244.00] Okay.
[6245.00 → 6246.00] I'm not suggesting anything.
[6246.00 → 6247.00] Okay!
[6247.00 → 6249.00] Well, I think that's pretty much it.
[6249.00 → 6251.00] Thank you everyone!
[6251.00 → 6252.00] And goodnight!
[6252.00 → 6253.00] Well...
[6253.00 → 6254.00] What?
[6254.00 → 6255.00] Goodnight for now.
[6255.00 → 6256.00] Until After Party.
[6256.00 → 6257.00] Which...
[6257.00 → 6260.00] I don't know how long we'll be able to go tonight.
[6260.00 → 6261.00] It's already 7.30.
[6261.00 → 6264.00] And we kinda have stuff to go do.
[6264.00 → 6265.00] Wow!
[6265.00 → 6266.00] Yeah, okay.
[6266.00 → 6267.00] Maybe we'll just go for...
[6267.00 → 6269.00] We showed up really late, and we went for two hours, I think.
[6269.00 → 6270.00] We went for two hours?
[6270.00 → 6271.00] I think so.
[6271.00 → 6272.00] Oh, okay.
[6272.00 → 6273.00] Okay.
[6273.00 → 6276.00] Well, thank you everyone!
[6276.00 → 6277.00] And...
[6277.00 → 6278.00] Goodnight for real this time.
[6278.00 → 6279.00] Goodnight.
[6279.00 → 6280.00] Thanks for watching.
