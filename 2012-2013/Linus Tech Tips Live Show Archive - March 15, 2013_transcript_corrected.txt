[0.00 → 7.80] Welcome to the live stream guys we've got a ton of cool topics tonight including
[7.80 → 14.04] I don't know what are our topics tonight I have a thing with topics, but I don't remember
[14.04 → 20.28] we've got some blackberry juice we've got we've got one of the most incendiary things I think I've
[20.28 → 24.40] ever heard which is apparently some game developers are running around saying the
[24.40 → 29.34] PlayStation 4 will outperform PCs for years to come which is he doingn't understand anything
[29.34 → 35.40] about performance or hardware anything at all about anything although it's funny
[35.40 → 40.32] because this was what going to be one of our featured news items from the Linus Tech Tips forum and I
[40.32 → 46.20] have to like the guy who posted this one I give him props for posting in our news section
[46.20 → 51.78] because that's great and that is appreciated, but he was a little bit sensationalist about his headline
[51.78 → 59.12] so I will clarify that once we move into that so why don't we start with something a
[59.12 → 65.84] little bit actually we've got a lot of crazy stuff to talk about we're gonna talk about your Windows
[65.84 → 72.62] 8 downgrade we're gonna talk about how I'm actually not going to be moving to Windows 8 on my personal rig
[72.62 → 81.50] I hope that Twitter managed to where the heck is the where's the got it I got it I got if it's always
[81.50 → 87.32] behind yes just always assume that it's fine nope I refuse to do that that is clearly incorrect and
[87.32 → 92.22] a bad thing that I will not be doing at all it's always behind you oh did I leave the twitch stream on
[92.22 → 99.92] they came from behind yes oh yeah we'll be talking Star craft heart of the swarm because we have an actual
[99.92 → 105.14] gamer on the show this week him they fit that in there by the way in the campaign there's a
[105.14 → 112.02] I was so stoked oh I love that so stoked when I heard it they also fit a Wilhelm scream into the
[112.02 → 119.36] trailer oh no yeah a marine gets stepped on, or I can't, I can't do the Wilhelm scream hold on
[119.36 → 125.54] ah no it's like impossible to recreate yeah it's its awesome though if you don't know what Wilhelm scream
[125.54 → 131.84] is YouTube it yeah YouTube it not now because it's in like every movie ever yeah especially Star Wars
[131.84 → 137.00] yeah anything to do with LucasArts every Star Wars every Luke every Indiana Jones every Star Wars video
[137.00 → 144.14] video movie we make videos George Lucas makes movies or at least he did in the 70s and 80s
[144.14 → 153.52] and you could argue some he made some later those are videos oh that's okay I'm not going to get into
[153.52 → 158.60] original trilogy versus new trilogy that would be an interesting live topic we're going to talk
[158.60 → 165.20] batteries we're going to talk about oh okay, so this is this okay here let's kick it off so the've only
[165.20 → 169.30] got 200 and oh okay the viewers are going up a little bit I'm just a little bit confused because I
[169.30 → 175.14] I'm never quite sure if the live stream starting now think do you have to actually specifically
[175.14 → 182.16] announce on Twitch that you're streaming because I think there's like an announcement button, but I don't
[182.16 → 186.80] know how exactly that works you know what I'm not going to worry about it too much I have no idea
[186.80 → 192.80] a few people said nope or not really okay I have to get on this stream jet so lets uh let's
[192.80 → 199.26] get started with the Belching Links acquisition is pretty much done, so I got an email from my Links
[199.26 → 207.26] contact today saying that his email is changing from his name at cisco.com to his name at I think
[207.26 → 212.78] I think it's going to be a Links email now so Belching has come out and said okay we're keeping
[212.78 → 219.10] the two different uh streams of products separate, so product development is still going to be separate
[219.10 → 225.26] um product uh branding is still going to be separate okay so when Cisco did the Links acquisition
[225.26 → 230.50] in fact if I could find a Cisco I see I called it a Cisco router if I could find a Links router
[230.50 → 234.60] lying around here somewhere I'd be able to show you they actually say Cisco right on the top yeah in
[234.60 → 243.82] fact that's what happened when Links asked us to change because we originally oh yeah had our CES
[243.82 → 250.70] content branded Cisco because we couldn't find the Links brand in use anywhere they probably already
[250.70 → 255.80] knew that it was coming soon so they were like uh yeah we saw your first video, and we'd actually
[255.80 → 263.20] uh we'd really like you to change that to uh Links brand and stuff
[263.20 → 269.18] good call taking that out was someone complaining about it uh might have been audible no I heard it
[269.18 → 273.38] anyway so uh so yeah that's probably what happened there so anyway they're going to keep them separate
[273.38 → 280.30] and it's going to be pretty much business as usual for Links as a separate though I think so too
[280.30 → 285.44] because there's nothing wrong with the product no, no like we actually we did some fascinating
[285.44 → 292.98] testing with the EA was it the 42 or the 45 45 versus the with the EA was it the 42 or the 45 45
[292.98 → 300.50] versus the n900 now versus the n900 from WD, and we found that without any optimization or tweaking of the
[300.50 → 306.28] Los at all it was just such a beast for very heavy network loads insane like we did crazier
[306.28 → 312.28] stuff that we do on that network like ever that was probably the hardest load we ever put on it
[312.28 → 320.34] multiple Netflix streams uh Skype call a game stream um and tormenting and tormenting yeah, and we had
[320.34 → 324.76] like six or seven computers going so it was like crazy, and it was like a lot of torrents because we
[324.76 → 329.62] were pushing back and forth from school yeah, so even things like the website are going to stay the same
[329.62 → 335.70] so you're not going to actually know I mean I don't think someone like Belching acquiring a very
[335.70 → 341.08] strong networking brand like Links really wants to mess with it too much whereas with Cisco where
[341.08 → 345.78] they have that more premium branding I can understand why they'd want some trickle-down effect
[345.78 → 350.34] and it's like oh so it should be worth more of a premium because we're we're Cisco and honestly
[350.34 → 357.44] like to most consumers they will probably have no idea that the sale and acquisition ever occurred
[357.44 → 363.36] and that's probably a good thing yeah if they just nope nobody knows and that's exactly what we want
[363.36 → 370.38] yeah absolutely I think not many people are watching yet so uh hopefully this has blasted on Twitter or
[370.38 → 375.48] yeah there it is uh live stream starting now I see it so hopefully people uh tune in pretty quickly here
[375.48 → 381.74] because otherwise it's just us and our 400 most loyal viewers whatever man thank you guys for
[381.74 → 386.68] apparently planning your lives around being here to watch us live on our Friday night when we could
[386.68 → 393.10] otherwise be dating attractive women or eating bacon or eating yeah slick I actually haven't even had
[393.10 → 401.12] one BLT sandwich, and it's not even going to be hot by the time I eat if it's already not yeah oh even mine
[401.12 → 409.06] was like room temperature so disappoint all right so I don't remember what hotkeys we use for um
[409.06 → 417.82] for switching scenes anymore is it like shift is it f keys oh yeah there we go yay twitter okay so it's
[417.82 → 424.30] 2 a.m in Argentina thank you for tuning in can you do live stream at a sensible time for us British
[424.30 → 429.70] European types we will change it eventually yeah the plan is to change the plan is to change it
[429.70 → 436.30] probably time and probably day uh yeah probably day I don't want to do it on Friday nights I don't
[436.30 → 440.70] think most people want to do it on Friday nights because most people like even if you're not going
[440.70 → 447.46] out you're probably wanting to game with your buds so like I want to game with my buds I'm pretty sure
[447.46 → 450.44] they want to game with their yeah I'm pretty sure they want to game with their buds too someone's
[450.44 → 457.06] asking uh where happened to the Acer laptop oh it's still here slicks on my old MSI um like sort of
[457.06 → 462.22] gaming ready model that I try not to use because man is heavy, but it's kind of awesome because it's
[462.22 → 468.58] like quad-core and stuff but uh there we go let's go ahead and go back to our can you please do a video
[468.58 → 475.06] on the HIS 7970 gigahertz edition 3 gig what do you think of this GPU I think it's a 7970 gigahertz
[475.06 → 481.56] edition and I think it has three gigs of RAM and I think HIS put their sticker on it that's what I think
[481.56 → 487.16] bam does it worry you that google has control over your job with AdSense have you thought of
[487.16 → 491.90] setting a paid subscription for your site there is no way we are implementing any kind of paid
[491.90 → 497.80] subscription for our content bye bye every single viewer we have yeah I mean we love you guys and
[497.80 → 505.56] we know that you love us too, but we're pretty sure that we're all like nope premium content five dollar
[505.56 → 510.64] monthly subscription you guys are going to be like yeah I'll just go watch someone else's unboxing video so
[510.64 → 516.48] um I mean we think we make good content and all that good stuff but for us, I mean our value add
[516.48 → 524.06] that will allow us to no longer give google complete control over our livelihoods is our audience and if
[524.06 → 531.54] we alienate the audience than like we suck and on that note a word from our sponsor intel for the
[531.54 → 535.36] live stream what a great segue see I'm getting good at this right I don't like
[540.64 → 550.56] okay we're going to figure out how to play back the sponsor thing in a moment here I'm not quite sure
[550.56 → 555.58] what happened there uh it used to just play automatically okay give us a moment to give
[555.58 → 557.02] you a word from our sponsors
[570.64 → 582.00] this video is brought to you by our trusted partner intel for a limited time only with the
[582.00 → 587.84] purchase of any unlocked core i5 or core i7 intel CPU get a free intel beanie with a chance to win an
[587.84 → 593.28] intel snowboard valid for Canadian and U.S. customers only some restrictions apply for complete details
[593.28 → 601.60] visit intel gaming promo dot com, so the great news guys is that it's mid-March which means we're only
[601.60 → 607.28] going to have the intel snowboard promo running for about another two weeks um and I know some of you
[607.28 → 613.12] might not want to see it anymore hey we have another sponsor so speaking of sponsors and not relying on
[613.12 → 618.32] google forever that's a big part of the reason why we did two things so number one is we're reaching out
[618.32 → 624.72] and getting sponsors like sponsors that we trust that we actually use so if you go you know Linus
[624.72 → 631.44] what CPU are you using in your computer I'm using an intel CPU like at the same time and I've been
[631.44 → 637.12] using it for years not because intel sponsoring tech tips at the same time we're not hitting on AMD
[637.12 → 643.20] and at the same time we're not hitting on AMD in fact AMD particularly on the GPU side has been getting a
[643.20 → 649.52] lot of love lately from us check out the what's the most recent one we did uh battlefield 3.
[649.52 → 655.44] okay battlefield 3 yeah they won battlefield 3. I think they've won every single GPU showdown so
[655.44 → 660.56] far I think they won all of them and then like tied one or something yeah I think uh battlefield 3 was
[660.56 → 666.80] more of a tie and then crisis 3 steamroller but still the top two spots in battlefield 3 if
[666.80 → 670.96] you look at the overall chart that's true which is poked in at the end by a little bit because there
[670.96 → 675.60] isn't really a good vocal segue for me to overlay the overall chart, but it is there so if you guys
[675.60 → 680.24] are watching the battlefield 3 video go somewhere near the end and it just kind of goes hello and
[680.24 → 685.04] then leaves after a little while but check it out that's like the whole like all the cards on one
[685.04 → 689.92] big chart you can see the top two spots are actually MD cards there you go um, although we have a new
[689.92 → 695.92] sponsor so cooler master particularly cm storm gaming peripherals which I think both you and I have been
[695.92 → 701.92] pretty raw raw raw about same factory as filch like you can't really that's all you really need
[701.92 → 708.80] to know you can't even go that wrong I've got a quick fire TK upstairs that I use like whenever
[710.00 → 715.12] whenever your ducky was dead whenever my ducky was dead yeah or when I was swapping the keycaps out of
[715.12 → 720.00] my ducky or like I bring it home if I go to my parents house for weekends it's easier to travel with
[720.00 → 725.76] like it's yeah it's nice and like it's pretty rugged too so cooler master's on board now which
[725.76 → 731.76] we're really excited about and in addition to that we also just signed with twitch.tv as a YouTube network
[731.76 → 737.68] so we won't have to rely on Google's ad sales anymore so twitch is actually going to be responsible
[737.68 → 743.68] for filling our videos but like the regular YouTube pre-rolls with hopefully more relevant ads which I think
[743.68 → 751.28] is important yeah um as well as hopefully you know not making us rely strictly on Google which I mean
[751.28 → 756.32] even now we rely on Google in huge ways just for the infrastructure yeah uh delivering the videos to
[756.32 → 761.20] you guys they make all kinds of mistakes that honestly cost us a lot of money and a lot of headache
[761.76 → 768.72] uh not delivering our videos to our subscribers yeah subscription box I have um my personal YouTube
[768.72 → 776.48] account gets like less than a quarter of the lines tech tips uploads I'm like what I should be getting
[776.48 → 782.64] all of these very frustrating I mean there's that there's the fact that uh YouTube screws up on things
[782.64 → 789.20] like we had a video set to private, and it went public so we accidentally broke embargo on the GTX titan
[789.20 → 794.96] launch which was not cool, and they've had I mean that's been broken for months at a time in the past
[794.96 → 800.88] to the point where it's just kind of ridiculous so uh so yeah we still rely on them in a big way but
[800.88 → 806.40] we're not going to rely on them for our livelihoods which is sort of exciting well not entirely for our
[806.40 → 811.92] livelihoods we'll still rely on them yeah if anyone from Google's watching we'd still love you please
[811.92 → 822.48] don't shut off our channel don't close our channel yes we like our channel um okay so let's talk galaxy s4
[822.48 → 826.00] actually you know what no let's go to let's go to twitter for a little bit of q a here
[826.80 → 831.60] let's see what you guys have to say about the show so far I'm just going to go ahead sorry if people
[831.60 → 836.72] notice that I'm looking down a lot I'm trying to get on twitch but I can't log into my account so
[836.72 → 841.20] oh I'm on twitch over here yeah but I want to be able to monitor it here yeah okay we should just be
[841.20 → 845.20] monitoring it we should be monitoring the chat at all times because you guys notice when anything's
[845.20 → 849.68] wrong right away which is good uh johnny blaze says you should try the new blackberry z10 when you're
[849.68 → 854.72] done with the htc1 I would love to if anyone from blackberry is watching we'd love to hear from you
[854.72 → 860.56] we'd love to have an opportunity to try it out I mean it's funny because we've said that enough times
[860.56 → 865.68] like kind of joking, but then there was that guy from bell who watched, and we called them we said that
[865.68 → 870.56] their customer support with butt heads so he called us and fixed it like fixed everything's
[870.56 → 878.00] perfect now and then um we called our Raul good yeah formerly a voodoo who apparently left a comment
[878.00 → 883.60] on our video um because we said that uh we weren't sure if any of the solid gold cases is sold yes and
[883.60 → 890.80] he was like yes we sold at least one fifty thousand dollars for that gold case which is just unbelievable
[890.80 → 897.68] um, and you know what's what uh I checked it is him I had joshed follow up with him and find out if it was
[897.68 → 902.00] actually him, and it actually was Raul if you're wondering where that comment came from on YouTube
[902.00 → 906.64] you can just set whatever name you want yeah so we've had like Barack Obama comment on our videos
[906.64 → 912.64] I'm like I'm pretty sure it's not bro I'm pretty sure Barry has uh some other videos to
[912.64 → 918.40] watch that are not related to technology and whatnot pretty sure if he wanted a perfect computer he
[918.40 → 923.12] would just kind of have a perfect computer do you think the 7970 is better for battlefield 3 call
[923.12 → 927.92] of duty and Tomb Raider you know what we have to do Tomb Raider yeah I want to wait I want to wait
[927.92 → 932.96] till driver optimization I don't want to do too many beta drivers anymore because all the weird stuff
[932.96 → 937.68] maybe in a couple of weeks so what we're going to do is we're going to wait till AMD and NVIDIA
[938.48 → 944.88] both drop pretty good driver optimization revisions okay then I'll run all the test benches for
[944.88 → 950.72] that bench benchmarks not test benches yeah um we're all running on all the test benches every test
[950.72 → 954.56] bench we have uh I'll run all the benchmarks for that, and then we'll release a video on that right
[954.56 → 960.24] away, and then you'll have your bf3 and Tomb Raider did he mention another game uh battlefield 3 cod and
[960.24 → 965.92] Tomb Raider so I mean cod runs on like an Atari so I wouldn't worry about it man yeah fine it's
[965.92 → 971.76] probably okay just don't stress don't stress Jason it's cool all right speaking of which someone asked
[971.76 → 976.56] for a shout-out to Jason but a different Jason slick could you tell us about your personal rig maybe we'll
[976.56 → 981.60] cover that when we talk about your Windows 8 downgrade someone asked is racer really that bad
[981.60 → 985.04] because from what I hear on the internet it's the worst branding in the world no I don't think that's
[985.04 → 992.64] true at all I mean like any company not every product is perfect but I mean the um orb weaver
[992.64 → 998.96] is by far the best game pad that we've ever encountered uh what was the name of that uh that
[998.96 → 1005.92] controller the safer tube right when we saw at CES it's not tournament ready or is it tournament ready
[1005.92 → 1010.64] the other ones not tournament ready oh that I don't remember it's either the previous racer
[1013.28 → 1018.64] I think it's no orcas a headset I know the one you're onza yeah um it's I can't remember if
[1018.64 → 1023.76] it's the Monza or the new safer tooth well the new one has those buttons on the bottom they're
[1023.76 → 1029.52] removable, or they're not oh no, and they're not macro ready right, so the new one is tournament ready one
[1029.52 → 1034.48] yeah right because you can't rebind all the buttons all over the place yeah so I mean and the build
[1034.48 → 1040.00] quality of it was outstanding especially compared to the older one which wasn't as good I mean
[1040.00 → 1047.12] that black widow ultimate is a very solid mechanical keyboard I mean guys I guess oh yeah and the blade
[1048.24 → 1052.56] the blade is probably right up there with guys like apple in terms of the build quality of that notebook
[1053.28 → 1063.20] all I'm going to say I've owned two racer mycoses or Lachesis neither of them work okay so I think it's a
[1063.20 → 1067.76] mixed bag when you have people that have a bad experience then they're much more likely to talk
[1067.76 → 1074.64] about that than a good experience that's also very true and talking from my NCI experience where i
[1074.64 → 1081.12] know what the sales numbers look like I can tell you right now if you see five complaints about racer
[1081.12 → 1085.36] compared to some other gaming brand it might have something to do with the fact that they're selling
[1086.00 → 1093.44] five times more than them or more right so that's definitely a very valid and very large point I mean
[1093.44 → 1097.92] it was like that with Oct and SSDs for the longest time when people are like all the complaints I see
[1097.92 → 1103.04] about SSDs are Oct well yeah all the SSDs that are selling are Oct so what do you want me to say
[1103.60 → 1109.84] like yeah whatever man uh okay so let's go back I'm working on a prodigy built what does your wife
[1109.84 → 1114.16] think about you using the living room as a workshop for your personal rig I actually am not any more my personal
[1114.16 → 1120.88] rig is almost done I'm working on a prodigy build I thought you finished well I still have to my uh
[1120.88 → 1126.32] the power adapter I made myself I made a left angle power adapter for my optical drive but I used wires
[1126.32 → 1131.12] that were too thin, and they didn't bite into the thing enough so I have to replace that I have to fix
[1131.12 → 1136.08] the extension wire I was using for my four fans on the bottom because it is like broke or something
[1136.64 → 1143.68] decrepit somehow I have to remount the top led strip because the included adhesive with the phobias is not
[1143.68 → 1147.36] holding it in place so I'm going to use my double-sided Velcro yeah and then I have to figure
[1147.36 → 1153.12] out how to bleed that bloody t-virus so it was pretty close was it not it's getting there but I'm
[1153.12 → 1156.96] thinking if I stick like something in there and just kind of swirl it around that might help you can
[1156.96 → 1161.28] do that then you have to take those caps off and that's not always the easiest no no it's easy with the fill
[1161.28 → 1166.40] port yeah you can just stick it through the fill port I think it should be okay you get tied up in the uh
[1167.60 → 1171.36] maybe in the helix I don't know I haven't tried yet either way if you want to do shake
[1171.36 → 1175.60] this is like totally has nothing to do with this I don't want to shake the computer but if you want
[1175.60 → 1180.88] to do shake we can lift it up and I can stabilize it you can shake oh, oh I shudder to think because
[1180.88 → 1185.12] there's enough things that just are broken enough about it um we're not going to talk about a bit torrent
[1185.12 → 1189.68] on the show we like to keep things clean but feel free to talk about a bit torrent somewhere else
[1190.24 → 1195.84] uh thoughts on Eric joining the new egg crew I think it's I think it's a huge benefit for the new
[1195.84 → 1202.40] egg TV guys I mean he brings with him an enormous audience yeah he's got his crew basically like
[1202.40 → 1206.48] he's got all the guys that are going to follow him which is his been around forever I mean you
[1206.48 → 1212.16] look at how quickly tech of tomorrow grew when he departed from motherboards org and channel pro
[1212.72 → 1217.60] it's going to be interesting departing from motherboards.org channel pro yeah going to check
[1217.60 → 1222.80] of tomorrow which he was already kind of he was already kind of running on his own but like boosting it up and then
[1222.80 → 1228.56] ditch boost up he may, I don't know what his plan is I haven't talked to him, he may maintain it but
[1228.56 → 1234.80] because I know kyle and Paul at least have their own channels yes they do awesome sauce news and Paul's
[1234.80 → 1239.76] hardware if you guys want to check them out Paul did a perfect video review of the Leonidas 30 inch
[1239.76 → 1247.12] IPS uh monitor that's available for like 600 700 bucks one bay yeah um, so guys check out his video of
[1247.12 → 1251.28] that if you're looking at a large format display which it happens I am because mine's broken now
[1253.52 → 1258.00] if you want the story on that because he probably doesn't want to reiterate it personal build
[1258.00 → 1263.04] personal rig update 15. It's pretty much the most depressing video I think either of us have ever
[1263.04 → 1271.68] filmed yeah yeah oh spring break is it spring break yes it's been so long since I've been in school i
[1271.68 → 1277.28] don't even think about it any more maybe that's why no one's watching Linus please enable 240p viewing option
[1277.28 → 1283.92] I have no idea how to enable or disable different viewing options I think that's handled by twitch
[1283.92 → 1288.24] we stream at 1080p but I believe you can be downscale it to whatever you want yeah I have no idea how to do
[1288.24 → 1297.92] that yeah no idea um all right so let's move into our next discussion topic should we just let's just
[1297.92 → 1303.92] let's just hit the galaxy s4 now shall we boom so we cheated a little bit in our teaser video for the
[1303.92 → 1310.96] live stream where we said we had a galaxy s4, but actually we don't have this is just a galaxy s3 which
[1310.96 → 1316.16] should give you guys some idea of how different we think the s4 is from the s3 if you look at the front
[1316.16 → 1324.64] of the s4 the camera and these two little LEDs go slightly more vertical and this little indicator led
[1324.64 → 1331.52] is now visible just like these no go slow hold on slow down you're blowing my mind man
[1331.52 → 1336.16] it's visible you can see it's got the black ring just like the other ones it goes slightly more
[1336.16 → 1343.44] vertical, and it comes all the way over here to go right beside the speaker no way hold on beside the
[1343.44 → 1348.00] speaker fan freaking task game changer I don't even know who could have possibly thought about that
[1348.00 → 1356.88] the button is like slightly more squared off hold on there's a button one button you can't
[1356.88 → 1361.68] put more than one button okay although with that said the HTC one does not have a button I don't know
[1361.68 → 1368.08] if you noticed that I did there is no middle button there's a HTC left I'm not sure what to think
[1368.08 → 1374.16] because you know you double tap home to get to your recent apps which is fine which is fine I'm okay
[1374.16 → 1379.60] with a double tap it's fast and the haptic feedback on this thing is outstanding okay let's stay focused
[1379.60 → 1386.56] on s4 focused on s4 okay, okay physical changes carry on the back take it off and show what the inside
[1386.56 → 1394.88] difference is okay, okay here I'll hold this one so back from here all the way up to there is pretty much
[1394.88 → 1405.52] the same okay and then the flashlight goes down under the camera and this disappears okay and that is
[1405.52 → 1410.72] innovation, and it's do you have the specs up on your computer I can get it up yeah get the full
[1410.72 → 1416.16] specs up because I'm going to start I'm gonna talk about sort of the philosophy behind what might
[1416.16 → 1424.80] have driven Samsung to go with a very similar to galaxy s3 design so no matter how much I rag on
[1424.80 → 1429.20] it does kind of make sense yeah it kind of makes sense okay because when you looked at galaxy one
[1429.20 → 1438.32] honestly it wasn't a great phone no wife has one it has not really served her well no I'm not
[1438.32 → 1443.20] going to rag on them or anything, but they knew it wasn't great galaxy s2 came out pretty quickly
[1443.20 → 1452.40] and revamped everything it went AMO led it went uh way faster it had a way better screen it
[1452.40 → 1457.92] was just better in every possible way, and they completely reinvented it with the galaxy s2 then
[1457.92 → 1462.96] galaxy s3 came along and went okay we're going to turn every take everything that was good about the s2
[1462.96 → 1467.92] and keep it we're going to go with a shape that's much nicer to hold did the screen get bigger I don't
[1467.92 → 1473.68] remember I think so I think it did I can't, I can't remember galaxy s2 again though pretty sure it did
[1473.68 → 1479.36] didn't last that long and was replaced by a phone that was significantly better in every possible way
[1479.36 → 1487.04] and replaced it now galaxy s3 hung around with us for a long time I mean this launched we did a video
[1487.04 → 1495.36] back around launch so that's going to give me some idea of when it was but NCI com galaxy
[1496.40 → 1502.72] someone's probably already uh oh galaxy video card eight months ago so this launched almost a year
[1502.72 → 1509.92] ago like nine ten months ago and here we are finally Samsung's replacing it with the s4 which is
[1512.24 → 1518.40] similar but remember this time they're not replacing a phone that was fundamentally flawed in any way
[1518.40 → 1525.20] they're replacing a phone that was I did really well the number one selling smartphone yeah if you're
[1525.20 → 1533.44] Samsung do you reinvent the wheel when the wheel's spinning perfect one thing I brought up when
[1533.44 → 1541.92] we were well not good yeah go ahead um, um sorry that was funny uh we were in the car talking about it
[1541.92 → 1547.60] and I was like okay well if it's really similar form factor and just like awesome sauce specs compared
[1547.60 → 1554.80] to before why don't they take the apple approach and just call it like not an s because it's already
[1554.80 → 1564.08] s because Samsung but like the Samsung GS x right CSX or something like add another thing to the end
[1564.08 → 1568.56] because they're not changing not really changing the form factor of the phone not changing
[1568.56 → 1574.48] stuff like that and then you I mean that's something apple's gets away with though because they've been
[1574.48 → 1582.08] doing it for so long yeah I mean you know what an s means an s means an evolutionary change um I mean
[1582.08 → 1587.12] they've done this with iPad as well where they don't even rebrand the damn thing anymore no they just go
[1587.76 → 1593.76] ipad with retina display so you when you buy an iPad you're buying an iPad unless it's an iPad 2 so
[1593.76 → 1600.24] there was ipad 2 and iPad yeah with retina and i I mean maybe something like that would have been
[1600.24 → 1605.76] appropriate here as a galaxy s3 Uber edition or like whatever the brand likes better branding than
[1605.76 → 1611.92] that but then branding consolidation is a really, really big deal and that brings this into play
[1611.92 → 1616.64] okay let's talk about that later hold on I want to talk specs on this first okay, okay so Samsung's
[1616.64 → 1623.84] either going to have um a what is it snapdragon s600 is it called s600 something snapdragon 600
[1623.84 → 1630.24] something or other um so that's going to be a 1.9 gigahertz quad-core which is pretty similar to the
[1630.24 → 1637.84] 1.7 gigahertz uh, uh snapdragon 600 that's in the htc1 a little bit faster, although it has a beefier
[1637.84 → 1643.76] battery 2600 William hours compared to 2300 or 2350 or something like that um, but there's going to be
[1643.76 → 1649.60] another version that's an outscore Asians or whatever they call their thing uh that's an outscore
[1649.60 → 1656.32] that has four a7 cores and four a15 cores now I would go as far as to say if their intention is to
[1656.32 → 1662.00] use those four cores either for power saving or performance it's still kind of a quad-core can
[1662.00 → 1667.68] NVIDIA get away with calling Terra 3 a five core because they kind of tried it at first and then
[1667.68 → 1671.92] they backed off on it because they have that that low power core and then the four performance ones is
[1671.92 → 1676.72] that exactly how it's supposed to work switching for power saving my understanding is that's how the
[1676.72 → 1681.20] OCTA core is supposed to work come on you're not going to benefit from an OCTA core no like four
[1681.20 → 1686.00] equal cores it's nuts and the OCTA core is clocked at 1.6 gigahertz so it's going to vary depending on
[1686.00 → 1691.44] region what spec you get so the htc1 by contrast you're going to get the same spec regardless of
[1691.44 → 1697.20] region, but there are six different versions supporting different bands for different regions that make
[1697.20 → 1702.24] sense, but you get the same CPU regardless yeah um what else have they changed spec wise so they've added
[1702.24 → 1706.64] so it's a five inch 1080p I keep holding this because for all intents and purposes I'll hold this far
[1706.64 → 1713.12] enough away that you can't tell uh it's a five inch 1080p display AMO led the rumours were that the
[1713.12 → 1719.20] AMO led uh production line wasn't ready yet, and it was going to be LCD but very exciting so you're
[1719.20 → 1724.32] going to get those here deep rich blacks power savings assuming you're not looking at really bright stuff
[1724.32 → 1731.28] all the time that's really exciting um it's going to come with 4.2.2 jellybean ridiculous 12 megapixel
[1731.28 → 1738.00] camera 13 13 13 yeah 13 megapixel camera with two on the front cam and that leads us to another
[1738.00 → 1741.36] sort of comparison point between the s we're not even going to be able to talk about the one because
[1741.36 → 1750.00] we're blending it in here so HTC went for a bold departure from whatever very bold instead of a high
[1750.00 → 1755.52] megapixel rear camera they have a four megapixel rear camera hold on I'm going to let that sink in for a moment
[1755.52 → 1763.36] there, and you know what's kind of stupid is I had all my notes for the HTC uh unboxing that we did
[1763.36 → 1768.48] earlier deleted them all and I deleted them as we went but yes for undo I think I've got it they're
[1768.48 → 1775.04] calling it ultra pixel camera sensor, so this is a four megapixel third inch sensor with an
[1775.04 → 1781.52] f 2.0 lens and optical image stabilization that they're saying because of the larger pixels and the
[1781.52 → 1786.80] large sensor is actually able to capture more light and more detail even though the resolution
[1786.80 → 1792.64] that will appear when you right-click properties resolution is actually lower, and you were drinking
[1792.64 → 1797.04] around with it a little bit in the car on the way back, and it looks like and also based on reviews that
[1797.04 → 1801.28] we're seeing of the phone that might be true it looks perfect more megapixels may not be the
[1801.28 → 1805.36] solution so uh anyway Samsung has a 13 megapixel camera on this bad boy
[1805.36 → 1812.16] um it's available in a variety of different internal storage configurations, and it does have
[1812.16 → 1818.56] a micro SD slot which the one does not that to me is so confusing the way HTC continues to not
[1818.56 → 1824.24] implement micro SD in their high-end phones i personally never actually filled my iPhone 416 gig
[1824.24 → 1830.24] and you don't like but not everyone's like me some people want more storage there's their spot like
[1830.24 → 1834.08] they could have put a spot right on the bottom there just put a micro SD slot there for crying out
[1834.08 → 1841.28] loud like you can't take off the back okay you can't replace the battery okay, okay make an external
[1841.28 → 1846.48] plug-in for it's a tiny chip with that said the one only comes in 32 gig and 64 gig
[1846.48 → 1853.28] configurations big so I would never manage to filter I know that I actually will both of us won't I stream
[1853.28 → 1858.08] video to myself over my data plan I have a pretty generous data plan so I don't worry about it too much
[1858.88 → 1862.80] okay what else they got oh yeah so there you can interact with the touchscreen without quite touching it
[1862.80 → 1867.44] although I don't know how valuable that is uh it apparently pauses video if you look away although
[1867.44 → 1873.12] their camera-based eye tracking features have never necessarily worked for everyone so I don't know
[1873.12 → 1882.32] about that uh s travel trip advisor oh they're adding some of the cool features from the galaxy camera
[1882.32 → 1887.60] which we shot in NCI tech tips of today, and it's actually really cool yeah it's actually pretty awesome
[1887.60 → 1892.80] I just wish it had a phone in it yeah okay we were talking about this the galaxy camera is running
[1892.80 → 1899.92] android yes and android jellybean, and we were thinking if you just add like a speaker and a mic
[1899.92 → 1908.00] yeah it's got it supports um it supports data it supports data with a micro sim yeah, yeah so if
[1908.00 → 1913.04] you're going to have a plan for the stupid thing, and you don't actually and if you're one of the I mean
[1913.04 → 1919.36] let's face it there are people out there who don't care about a thin phone these people exist and the
[1919.36 → 1925.28] galaxy camera is not that thick like it's probably if I took look at all the Samsung product placement
[1925.28 → 1930.24] here Samsung SSDs like if you took sort of a phone and a couple SSDs it's kind of like that without the
[1930.24 → 1935.76] lens sticking out expand your storage today strap a SSD to your phone I might be the kind of person who
[1935.76 → 1940.64] would actually say you know what for the sake of having an awesome camera and video camera as a vlogger
[1940.64 → 1946.96] maybe I don't care about a slim phone anymore if I'm going somewhere I've got my backpack that's right
[1946.96 → 1952.80] would you actually mind putting your phone slash camera in like a drink pouch or something on your
[1952.80 → 1959.84] backpack if you can play games on it, it would be cool if it had the functionality so that I could bounce
[1959.84 → 1967.04] my sim right or just get you can get a supplementary sim yeah or do something like that share the plan
[1967.04 → 1971.76] like that if I could share the plan that would be awesome like a self family plan for your camera and
[1971.76 → 1975.68] your phone and your tablet or something because and your notebook or something like that yeah because
[1975.68 → 1978.96] there are some times that I'm going to go out and I don't have my bag because that's probably where we're
[1978.96 → 1985.28] headed and I see no reason why I shouldn't be able to take a phone call on my notebook if I feel like it
[1985.28 → 1990.00] yeah or on my camera if I feel like it why not and while everyone's talking about everything
[1990.00 → 1996.00] getting smaller and stuff and like phones getting thinner cameras like you need the sensor you need the
[1996.00 → 2001.36] lenses you need the distance you have to have that distance well neither of us are actually experts
[2001.36 → 2007.68] on cameras we know basic physics we know diesel, and we know diesel we knew this before we knew yes
[2007.68 → 2014.80] that's true and making the pixels small enough to the point where like uh like the the the I forget
[2014.80 → 2021.44] what it's called whatever this light wavelengths yeah where the light wavelength actually is not even
[2021.44 → 2026.16] going to be able to hit yeah because the pixel is too small you're trying to go into a box this big
[2026.16 → 2030.80] you're just with wavelengths like this you're just over sampling yeah so, so yeah that's that's an
[2030.80 → 2035.36] exciting departure what else we got from Samsung's phone so they amped up the battery life they amped
[2035.36 → 2040.72] up the GPU in a big way much more powerful should be much more competitive uh Samsung Knox will be
[2040.72 → 2046.08] supported so if you want to bring your own device BYOD is a big trend right now um so you'll have like a
[2046.08 → 2053.04] safety spot verse like where your uh your work can um sort of admin it for you, and you can
[2053.04 → 2058.32] VPN, and then you'll have like a consumer one where your Facebook pictures aren't going to be
[2058.32 → 2063.84] accessible to your office or anything like that however blackberry is moving their secure workstation
[2063.84 → 2070.64] over to iOS and android or secure workspace yeah secure workspace so maybe NOX is coming along at a
[2070.64 → 2076.32] time when it may not even end up mattering, although this is interesting because in my opinion if blackberry
[2076.32 → 2082.48] did this two maybe three years ago I think they would be in a way better position because blackberry's
[2082.48 → 2088.80] whole thing is workplace yep like it's always it's always been like they're they are the business phone
[2088.80 → 2094.00] or at least they were that's the problem a lot of people started moving their blackberry servers
[2094.00 → 2097.36] out and their blackberry security and all that kind of stuff because people weren't using blackberries
[2097.36 → 2102.40] anymore if blackberry rolled this out so that people all the businesses kept their blackberry
[2102.40 → 2108.40] infrastructure, so your theory is that then when blackberry got competitive on hardware again
[2108.40 → 2114.00] they'd be they would be ready easier to reintegrate everywhere right whereas if there's an infrastructure
[2114.00 → 2121.04] change yeah because now people that is a very competitive phone oh yeah for sure um now people that
[2121.04 → 2125.04] ditched businesses that ditched are going to have to if they want to roll out blackberries again
[2125.04 → 2130.08] go back again and doing another change is going to be hard to push through management, and you look
[2130.08 → 2136.56] at how long iOS and android were superior to blackberry and yet how long it took businesses to move away
[2136.56 → 2144.08] from blackberry because it was so good like how how how superior you have to be to drive someone to
[2144.08 → 2151.68] your solution versus how mediocre you can be and coast on it yeah it's ridiculous and like at the same
[2151.68 → 2156.08] time battle but I'm kind of rooting for them yeah I want blackberry to live I really want blackberry to
[2156.08 → 2161.36] live the z10 is an awesome phone I want to actually use it's super light it's kind of like iPhone 5 light
[2161.36 → 2169.28] like just no super like I like uh along those lines the s4 is getting lighter than the s3 and the htc1
[2169.28 → 2178.80] has some heft to it with its like sexy uh aluminum 200 minutes on a machine uh shell that is just blah it's like
[2178.80 → 2185.12] like very premium compared to this was an interesting one quick thing to add about blackberry
[2185.12 → 2190.24] I think if they still like just to bounce back on this again yeah if they still had their servers in
[2190.24 → 2194.80] place so if they gave out their software what they could have done with the z10 release is said look
[2194.80 → 2200.48] now we have another awesome phone with some added features for right blackberry secure workspace so
[2200.48 → 2205.76] they could have differentiated and been a standardized platform which would have driven more sales
[2205.76 → 2212.56] anyway continue right uh okay what else we got here uh s voice blah blah have we missed anything
[2212.56 → 2217.04] oh it has wireless ac although I have no idea what performance is going to be like because
[2217.04 → 2222.64] based on our experience with like an USB ac adapter it probably won't be any different from n it's that's
[2222.64 → 2229.84] my guess and like power hungry I mean the actual full performance ac solutions we run into have
[2229.84 → 2235.60] heat sinks as big as a phone on them a little bit bigger actually yeah so uh we don't have it here
[2235.60 → 2243.36] do we available with 1632 or 64 gigs with plus the micro SD slot and I think that's pretty much it so
[2243.36 → 2250.40] let's wrap up with some of the highlights of the htc1, so this has got the same uh the same snapdragon 600
[2250.40 → 2256.64] processor in it two gigs of ram just like the s4 it's got that ultra pixel camera it's got the ability to
[2256.64 → 2265.92] take Zoe's Zoe Zoe Zoe Zoe Zoe Zoe Zoe Zoe so it's a four to five still frames at a time while
[2265.92 → 2271.84] recording 1080p video which is very cool I think yeah and the idea is that you'll have kind of like
[2271.84 → 2277.76] little talking snippets uh like motion snippets kind of like uh like the newspapers and
[2277.76 → 2282.96] the portraits in Harry Potter daily profit yeah like in the daily profit and I think it's its either
[2282.96 → 2286.96] going to be really neat, or it's going to be kind of gimmicky and I won't end up using it but i
[2286.96 → 2291.44] actually don't know it's not one of those things like um where you look at it, and you're just
[2291.44 → 2295.44] like oh skip through this stuff tell me the spec of the stupid thing because I don't care about these
[2295.44 → 2302.08] gimmicky features so I'm actually willing to give that a shot um boom sound is a huge innovation and
[2302.08 → 2308.40] that's something that Samsung could have done front facing speakers come on guys why did this take so long
[2308.40 → 2313.60] every tablet and every smartphone from now on should have front facing speakers you can write
[2313.60 → 2319.52] me down as having said that because it matters if you actually expect this to be a content consumption
[2319.52 → 2326.16] device music movies games all of them benefit from front facing speakers because cupping your hand
[2326.16 → 2331.84] around the back of a phone to hear it properly is stupid and all the complaints I get from people and
[2331.84 → 2335.68] it's funny I get a lot of complaints about the audio levels being too low which is why we boosted them up
[2335.68 → 2341.44] tonight uh people are like oh I can't hear because I'm on my phone and I'm like oh it's because of
[2341.44 → 2347.04] your stupid crappy Ultrabook or phone speaker that doesn't actually go loud enough and people who reply
[2347.04 → 2351.28] to those people and say oh just turn your volume up they don't understand you guys are on a phone not
[2351.28 → 2355.84] on like a desktop computer where you can just crank it up so we're trying to get that addressed in recent
[2355.84 → 2361.20] videos and I hope we've done a pretty good job of that so uh there's that they have an infrared emitter
[2361.20 → 2365.20] and uh receiver built into the power button which I think is a really elegant way to do that
[2365.20 → 2371.68] so you can use it as uh as a universal remote and of course I mean the chassis is just outstanding
[2371.68 → 2377.20] it's really easy to hold in spite of the fact that it is 4.7 inch and I do have small hands
[2377.20 → 2381.36] uh it goes almost dead to edge, and it is 1080p just like the s4, so this is basically
[2382.32 → 2386.96] I guess it's also not out yet but I think it's going to be out first it's basically like a higher
[2386.96 → 2392.72] end s4 and then slightly lower clocks much better build quality right talking about release dates
[2392.72 → 2397.20] um Samsung s4 is I believe April 20th
[2399.20 → 2405.20] um so coming soon exciting about a month august no it is well that's nope that's something completely
[2405.20 → 2411.20] different okay so I don't know the release dates oh that was saints row four by the way we don't know
[2411.20 → 2416.24] so forget it we have no idea okay, so the last bit about phones we're not going to talk about phones
[2416.24 → 2423.12] anymore after this I don't think is that HTC's CMO actually came out I don't think I told you this yet
[2423.12 → 2429.36] fight words came out and said Samsung's galaxy s4 is quoted unquote more of the same
[2429.36 → 2437.28] whoa looking to grab some headlines there hey boss that might be a good tactic for them right now that
[2437.28 → 2443.92] might be the way to marketing sort of ride on the coattails of the Samsung marketing engine which
[2443.92 → 2448.88] exists now for the mobile product so okay last thing actual last thing so guys for those of
[2448.88 → 2454.08] you who have been asking me to do an I switched for android I am doing it I'm going to be using the
[2454.08 → 2460.80] HTC one as my android weapon of choice I'm done with Windows phone 8 we'll be giving away the 8s
[2460.80 → 2466.80] soon actually as well as a bunch of phones on the forum uh soon uh hopefully next week I guess
[2468.16 → 2471.92] think we can launch it is depends let's try and look we're going to stuff we're going to try and launch it
[2471.92 → 2476.16] next week um but yeah I'm going to do an android I switch and if there's anyone from blackberry watching
[2476.16 → 2480.16] please let me know and I'd love to do a blackberry I switched after that so I can give you guys that
[2480.16 → 2485.52] noob's perspective I've used android pretty extensively on tablet but I haven't used it
[2485.52 → 2490.32] much on a phone yeah, so this should be this should be fun uh why don't we do a little bit of twitter
[2490.32 → 2494.32] and then let's move into your downgrade unless you had something you really wanted to do uh nope but
[2494.32 → 2499.92] considering we peeped at it a second ago saints row 4 is announced I think this is one of if not the
[2499.92 → 2507.92] one of the first games to be announced since the the since the was dissolved people are asking me to do an
[2507.92 → 2514.88] OS 10 I switched yeah over my dead body you can quote me on that too yeah seriously um saints row 4
[2514.88 → 2521.84] release date August 20th in the states August 23rd in Europe oh awesome so i I think that's the first
[2521.84 → 2527.60] game that has been announced since the since the was dissolved I might be wrong so don't quote me on
[2527.60 → 2535.68] that okay cool yeah um blah blah blah blah like first game announced that was a part of the obviously
[2535.68 → 2542.56] can either of you guys recommend that what's that cm storm mouse we use at the office
[2543.92 → 2548.40] spawn oh it's the spawn okay sorry i we haven't tried the sentinel advance 2 mouse, but the spawn is
[2548.40 → 2552.48] actually better way better than I thought it was nice for really nice for claw yeah really nice claw
[2552.48 → 2557.20] tracks well tracks on a variety of surfaces we've used it extensively now because it's hooked up to our
[2557.20 → 2563.68] display computer in the NCI tech tip studio so um yeah let's move into I don't see anything that
[2563.68 → 2570.24] interesting on Twitter so uh let's move on to your downgrade so why don't you start can I actually
[2570.24 → 2574.16] just steal that sandwich from you, and then you can make a new one and I'm going to take a couple bites
[2574.16 → 2578.88] while you talk about your experience with Windows 8 I'd like you to cover it from a number of different
[2578.88 → 2584.64] angles i actually um have them here yeah switch to my laptop just throw it on top of there and I'm
[2584.64 → 2592.24] going to go now down on your sandwich how long using for it each how long using it for each yeah in like
[2592.24 → 2596.40] each of those different scenarios so you used it on notebook desktop, and you haven't really spent much
[2596.40 → 2603.12] time with it on touch, but you spent some right touch okay I've spent basically a completely negligible
[2603.12 → 2608.88] amount start with why you started on Windows 8. okay I started on Windows 8 because uh my laptop was a
[2608.88 → 2614.48] development laptop and I got Windows 8 from school so I was like hey might as well do it so I started
[2614.48 → 2620.00] with the developer preview um it was for a laptop though and all I really did on that laptop was
[2620.64 → 2627.12] basic coding which is in via inside an environment so Windows 8 isn't really gonna mess with that
[2627.12 → 2633.04] much and then I was exporting that and testing it on other machines not my own machine um and then
[2633.04 → 2639.60] basic web browsing like I wasn't doing very much with that laptop at all so didn't really get tons
[2639.60 → 2643.52] of usage out of that and that was not a touch screen laptop you had some frustrations at the beginning
[2643.52 → 2649.28] like shutting down i oh okay I had some frustrations a lot of frustrations shutting down I find getting
[2649.28 → 2654.24] to the charms' menu if you don't have like this is a touch screen Windows 8 laptop that I'm on right now
[2654.24 → 2659.52] if you have a touch screen you just swipe in, and it comes in very nicely, and you swipe out, and it goes
[2659.52 → 2665.44] up very nicely and that's awesome if you don't have a touch screen it sucks um that's mainly to do with
[2665.44 → 2669.36] when it first came out I've noticed got a little bit better but I still don't like it I don't like
[2669.36 → 2677.60] putting my mouse there and like waiting then having it just not come up and then I'm like guys I want to
[2677.60 → 2685.68] can i shut down please and then metro like or I guess not metro modern UI is that its official name
[2685.68 → 2692.00] modern UI is not for me at all I don't like it um again maybe a lot better for touch screen
[2692.88 → 2698.16] almost definitely a lot better for touch screen but I'm not into it as desktop user experience it looks
[2698.16 → 2706.64] amazing it feels perfect, but it takes too long like I just want to press start type in my stuff and
[2706.64 → 2714.16] go for it that was resolved by Windows 8 classic start which I downloaded through night can I uh can I
[2714.16 → 2719.52] chime in on modern UI so one of the issues with modern UI, and you look at even other popular
[2719.52 → 2727.52] touchscreen interfaces like iOS and android they are very touchy very swipe, but they don't actually
[2727.52 → 2732.32] get rid of the folder structure yeah they still have it, and it's still good and that was one of the
[2732.32 → 2737.20] frustrations I had with Windows phone 8 and I think is similar to your frustration with modern UI because
[2737.20 → 2743.84] if modern UI had tiles, but you could actually have sub tiles you probably would use it I would
[2743.84 → 2748.80] probably be fine carry on that probably would not be a big deal at all um I'm kind of a sucker for
[2748.80 → 2755.36] having cool backgrounds um so I like seeing my desktop and I like having a clean desktop I always go
[2755.36 → 2761.04] uh view don't show icons so I can have nice very, very clean backgrounds even on my phone the home
[2761.04 → 2769.84] screen of my phone is completely blank um if I can get past all these pop-ups the home screen of my
[2769.84 → 2773.76] phone is completely blank you can't really see very well right there, but there are no icons except for
[2773.76 → 2776.96] the mandatory ones at the bottom which I can probably get rid of if i room it with something
[2776.96 → 2781.44] weird, but it is not currently wrong with something weird, so there are mandatory icons on the bottom
[2781.44 → 2789.20] um okay, so those are like the initial feelings with my laptop although not a big deal and i just kind
[2789.20 → 2795.92] of left it there because that was not a high usage laptop I'll go into that but I didn't really do that
[2795.92 → 2801.36] way too much on my laptop anyway um then I'm like okay Windows 8 is released I have an official
[2801.36 → 2807.20] version I'm going to try and dive in because i I had to reinstall uh my Windows 7 installation on my
[2807.20 → 2812.56] desktop was pretty messed up and was probably going to stop booting pretty soon because of how messed up
[2812.56 → 2820.08] it was that was my fault by the way I'm not going to go way too into it but yeah um I had to reinstall so i
[2820.08 → 2824.72] was like okay I might as well dive in and try Windows 8 I've got everything on my data drive anyway
[2824.72 → 2828.16] I'm just reinstalling an operating system and basically nonexciting my program so it's not
[2828.16 → 2833.20] really that big of a deal um nine-night by the way if you're wondering why I keep saying this weird word
[2833.20 → 2839.04] it's n-i-n-i-t-e and then just that dot com, and you can go to the website it's really awesome way to
[2839.04 → 2843.36] install a whole bucket full of programs that you usually install when you're setting up a new computer
[2843.36 → 2850.48] anyways, anyways okay so user experience with my desktop a few random problems that I haven't seen a ton of
[2850.48 → 2854.56] people complain about um but I know it's not my hardware because I've tried it with other
[2854.56 → 2861.28] installs with Windows 8 and another uh no I mean uh other installations with Windows 7 sorry it's I get
[2861.28 → 2869.36] random screen flickers where it will just like in about a quarter of a second it'll just invert my
[2869.36 → 2874.88] screen and then flip it back and I'm like whoa what just happened and then other times it'll just go
[2874.88 → 2881.28] completely black screen but only on my main monitor, and it's not my driver I recently like i've done
[2881.28 → 2889.92] tons of troubleshooting for it um then I've got other problems like just, just weird like things
[2889.92 → 2894.64] won't really work very well like have a lot of problems with usb3 uh really you hadn't told me about
[2894.64 → 2901.28] that one i kind of got it working but like it's still just like sometimes it won't detect things um
[2901.28 → 2910.00] and just like weird problems with that some games like I can't play crisis warhead speaking of
[2910.00 → 2916.08] games not being able to be played over here you guys can kind of see it this test bench is I'm doing
[2916.08 → 2923.04] 8350 versus 3570k I've done pretty much all actually yeah all the Windows 7 testing that didn't take me
[2923.04 → 2929.28] very long because everything worked and then I had to set up a new SSD I knew everything with Windows 8 and
[2929.28 → 2932.88] the idea was we're going to do Windows 8 versus Windows 7 we're going to do Windows 8 on its own
[2932.88 → 2938.08] we're going to do like we're going to try and do a bunch of stuff to add on to Logan's
[2938.08 → 2943.04] testing with 3570k versus 8350 so I want to do a bunch of scenarios that he may not have done
[2943.04 → 2946.80] yet so we can just add to the discussion because that's a really interesting good discussion
[2947.44 → 2956.80] um I couldn't play Witcher 2 wouldn't play metro 2033 would not pull any save files from the iSCSI for
[2956.80 → 2967.84] who knows why um dirt 3 wouldn't play like all this stuff would not run at all so I tried reinstalling
[2967.84 → 2974.08] just absolutely everything and I think I'm going to be trying that again on Monday hopefully if I have
[2974.08 → 2978.96] some time I'll probably have some time um, so hopefully that will actually work this time and that's not my
[2978.96 → 2984.64] own personal rig, but that is something I've directly worked on so that is a personal experience um
[2984.64 → 2990.88] uh what were some of the other problems certain programs have weird permission requirements like
[2991.36 → 2998.56] for steam to be able to run you need to run it as an administrator why its steam come on for fire to
[2998.56 → 3006.96] be able to run on startup it needs to be always run as an administrator what why right like why that's so
[3006.96 → 3012.40] weird and like a lot of these problems were like okay I guess I'll go change that and allow this program
[3012.40 → 3017.92] to have administrator rights for whatever reason um, but it's just, and it wasn't that big of a deal
[3017.92 → 3022.96] but it was the screen problems that I had which finally did we get into the bit where we assumed
[3022.96 → 3027.52] Windows 7 and Windows 8 would have equal gaming performance because they're based on the same
[3027.52 → 3031.28] kernel using the same driver pretty much wasn't even going to talk about those numbers, but we can bring
[3031.28 → 3034.88] it up if you don't mind talking about it before the video yeah well we're not let's not go into depth
[3034.88 → 3041.52] but guys we have a Windows 7 versus Windows 8 using intel and AMD I told them set of gaming
[3041.52 → 3048.72] comparisons coming, and we are seeing some pretty interesting weird 20 performance drops going from
[3048.72 → 3053.68] Windows 7 to Windows 8. and then sometimes where sometimes equal and then sometimes where there's a
[3053.68 → 3060.24] huge drop, but then that's without antialiasing and then I add antialiasing and nothing changes for
[3060.24 → 3065.92] frame rates like exact same frame rates re-running these to replicate to see if we can replicate it
[3065.92 → 3070.72] and it's just like bizarre land kind of stuff and re-running them like a lot more than I normally do
[3070.72 → 3075.84] because I'm like no, no no this is weird so with all of that said I think you and I can both still
[3075.84 → 3082.24] agree Windows 8 is optimal for a device like this it's awesome for touch yeah it's great for touch it's
[3082.24 → 3087.12] great for tablets it's awesome all that kind of stuff and I mean if you want a mobile x86 platform so
[3087.12 → 3092.80] this is the iconic w700 we have an unboxing that's going to be uploaded soon outstanding something
[3092.80 → 3098.40] like a touch notebook would you go Windows 7 or Windows 8. for most my use cases for a notebook
[3098.40 → 3101.44] I'm not gaming whoa I totally missed that I'm not gaming
[3104.80 → 3111.68] for most my use cases for a notebook so not gaming um web browsing work in Excel work in PowerPoint
[3111.68 → 3117.20] work in word all that kind of stuff yeah yeah and honestly I love this notebook so much yeah
[3117.20 → 3121.20] in fact I'll take it back from you now um and Windows 8 is part of it the touch screen
[3121.20 → 3125.12] touch screen is one of those things where people say oh I can scroll just as easily with my keyboard
[3125.12 → 3129.12] and mouse you know what you don't necessarily want to sit with your hands on your computer
[3129.12 → 3134.56] while you read an article so maybe you want to rest them, and maybe it's faster to just go scroll
[3134.56 → 3140.88] scroll and sometimes the user experience of just being able to go uh that yeah or I want to do this and
[3140.88 → 3146.56] just like touch the things it's kind of nice instead of using these very interfaces um so
[3146.56 → 3152.32] yeah just to recap I don't hate Windows 8. I don't even dislike if it's just not perfect for my desktop
[3152.32 → 3157.84] user experience I will probably stick with it on my laptop um and I don't have a tablet so yeah i
[3157.84 → 3163.76] probably won't be moving to Windows 8 on my desktop um I just installed Windows 7 last night on my personal
[3163.76 → 3169.76] rig I had to reformat because of a situation where I accidentally unplugged half of my raid array
[3170.40 → 3173.60] while the computer was powered on and that doesn't really work so well with raid zero yeah
[3173.60 → 3180.48] raid zero it's not a good thing um so anyway I went Windows 7 partly because of the gaming experience
[3180.48 → 3184.40] that we're having on the test bench here although I don't know how much of that could be just
[3185.76 → 3190.24] we need to we need to do a lot more we haven't replicated it on a second machine yet
[3190.24 → 3196.32] yeah we can do that as well yeah so you know take all that with a grain of salt um but aside from
[3196.32 → 3201.60] that spending some more time with it on the notebook here I mean I don't like having things like control
[3201.60 → 3207.44] panel moved around on me, I don't like having things like search moved around on me um and the search is
[3207.44 → 3212.32] weird because it can only search in like files settings that's exactly what I meant the categories of
[3212.32 → 3220.16] search I find frustrating like why um the start menu fixes a lot of the issues but not necessarily
[3220.16 → 3224.56] quite all of them, and it has its own kind of problems classic start has its own problems and
[3224.56 → 3230.08] I really like arrow glass yeah which is kind of dorky but I like being able to see through the top of
[3230.08 → 3236.80] things and like you know what's weird you can make a transparency for some of the stuff but not all but
[3236.80 → 3242.48] not everything like the bottom bar the task bar will go transparent yeah, but then the top bar does
[3242.48 → 3248.40] not bars will not yeah and like at first he brought that up he's like oh I miss arrow glass I'm like no
[3248.40 → 3255.60] big deal and then I'm like oh well I use it i kind of want it back I use it I use it to see what's under
[3255.60 → 3261.28] stuff like even just that top bar that little sliver, and it just looks right oh I know it looks so good
[3261.28 → 3266.48] like you should be able to see through it like no I don't know not a big deal one thing that I'm going to miss
[3266.48 → 3272.80] a lot which you again don't care about wait no not the file copy no okay file copy is amazing
[3273.68 → 3279.04] I wish I could just like to download the file copy UI I mean Terra copy is okay, but it's not well
[3279.04 → 3286.72] integrated with windows no not very well and like yeah whatever um and then and then task manager the
[3286.72 → 3291.04] new task manager is no, no I agree 100 new task managers is outstanding so I'm going to miss those two
[3291.04 → 3296.16] things and then one thing that you don't care about at all but if you are running a bunch of
[3296.16 → 3301.60] backgrounds, and you have them switching if you have multiple monitors each one can have its own
[3301.60 → 3307.04] background there has to be some third party there is third party utility is it pay one you have to pay
[3307.04 → 3317.28] for it okay two it just sucks okay so like oh I don't know all right then um yeah so there you go guys
[3317.28 → 3325.36] what are your impressions of heart of the swarm okay so I haven't played enough multiplayer yet the
[3325.36 → 3331.52] campaign is awesome um if you like RTS campaigns especially if you like star craft I suggest going
[3331.52 → 3335.76] and playing it and play it all the way through because the story wraps up kind of nicely there's
[3335.76 → 3341.92] a few times when I'm like really did you really just do that why did you just do that, but it ends up
[3341.92 → 3348.48] wrapping us wrapping up very nicely um multiplayer some of the new units that came out are really cool
[3349.28 → 3354.32] interesting fun all that kind of stuff balance I think might be a little bit odd right now
[3354.32 → 3358.80] weren't they thinking of removing carriers they were going to remove carriers which was going to remove
[3358.80 → 3365.44] me from the game because I just have that's like classic I love carriers man and like whenever I get to
[3365.44 → 3369.76] late game it's always fun to just like play normally and then all of a sudden be like carriers
[3369.76 → 3376.64] because they never expect it oh so much fun um anyway so and like okay the unbalanced thing
[3377.36 → 3382.72] is coming from a person that plays protons and is finding certain units on protests unbalanced in a
[3382.72 → 3388.32] way that they're slightly overpowered so I'm not being biased being like oh taken and zero are overpowered
[3388.32 → 3394.88] like there are certain units on my team that are kind of nuts um there's one flyer unit that has a whole
[3394.88 → 3398.24] bunch of abilities, but you can change its mode talk as if you're talking to them, and they know what you're
[3398.24 → 3402.64] talking about you, you can change its mode which makes it constantly use energy, but that means
[3402.64 → 3408.48] that it can now shoot it can't normally auto attack um, but it's really fast moving, and it doesn't cost
[3408.48 → 3416.40] nearly as much as say a void ray um so you can get it in behind mineral lines you can get it in
[3416.40 → 3421.44] behind mineral lines really quickly activate this energy ability and just decimate mineral lines
[3421.44 → 3426.72] and then fly them away the energy will constantly go down even if you're not shooting so you have to be
[3426.72 → 3432.48] careful with toggling it and stuff but just the speed at which you can clear minion lines or uh
[3433.28 → 3438.32] mineral lines is insane, and they're really fast, and they're not that expensive so you can pump out
[3438.32 → 3443.36] three and then jump behind the guy's mineral line and just like clear it and that's game over they'll
[3443.36 → 3448.72] just be like sup GG noob have fun making a little bit more money not being able to afford anti-air
[3448.72 → 3453.52] turrets and having me just re-wipe your mineral line every time it's their perfect and now like
[3453.52 → 3458.24] I've only played a couple multiplayer games I honestly don't even really know the new units for
[3458.24 → 3462.48] the other races um so I'm probably not the best person to talk to about this and there might be
[3462.48 → 3467.92] perfect counters for them, and realistically they might suck um but every time I've used them
[3467.92 → 3475.76] it's just been kind of ridiculous I've just disallowed the other team from having workers at all so I don't
[3475.76 → 3482.16] know that's kind of cool but not fair so yeah really, really fun I need to get more used to it
[3482.16 → 3487.60] I've been out of star craft for a while I haven't played for a really long time ladder matches last
[3487.60 → 3493.28] night was like the first time I've done ladder matches in months right so I'm pretty out of it but
[3493.28 → 3498.48] maybe next stream I'll be able to come back with a much more knowledgeable opinion on it on the
[3498.48 → 3504.72] multiplayer side at least so overall recommended for 39.99 I was surprised to see a 39.99 price point it's not
[3504.72 → 3509.20] a full price expansion yeah that's awesome that is cool and especially from someone like blizzard
[3509.76 → 3514.64] who's like yeah release full price expansions all the time but then yeah it's not a full price
[3514.64 → 3520.08] expansion the campaign is not short I beat it in two days, but that was like that was two pretty
[3520.08 → 3526.08] intense days I hardly saw him yeah I like would disappear after work and then stay up until like
[3527.76 → 3533.52] five or six in the morning and then come back to work the next day you were so crabby in a couple of
[3533.52 → 3539.36] those mornings um like you're banned I was gonna I was tempted to be like look you can't play star craft
[3539.36 → 3544.80] until that late at night and come to work cranky like that but I beat it that's what was important
[3545.36 → 3551.44] yeah that is the important thing I suppose beating a video game they added a lot of really cool changes
[3551.44 → 3560.00] now um there are levels so you're like your person levels up I guess I think you gain levels depending on
[3560.00 → 3564.96] what race you're playing so like I'm a whatever level protons and I could be a different level zero
[3564.96 → 3570.96] I think and while you're playing like as you spawn units as you kill units as you build buildings you
[3570.96 → 3574.96] gain experience, and then you gain experience depending on like how long the game was and all
[3574.96 → 3580.72] this kind of stuff which adds a cool dynamic which is more fun for not the extremely hardcore players
[3580.72 → 3585.84] right which is like oh cool I'm levelling up everyone loves more stats like stats and achievements
[3585.84 → 3592.48] exactly there's way more of that kind of stuff in the game which honestly it is kind of cheesy but
[3592.48 → 3597.28] I just love if it's cool I like levelling up in star craft I like getting experience in star craft
[3597.28 → 3602.48] because it's just like oh that's cool like I built this unit and then killed this dude so I got experience
[3602.48 → 3607.44] for building the unit and I got experience for killing him like I don't know its kind of cool it is
[3607.44 → 3612.64] cheesy, but it's kind of cool I like it did you ever ah yes we do have a build log of the week okay I'll have
[3612.64 → 3616.72] to I'll have to open that up on there when we get a minute next time you're talking for a bit
[3616.72 → 3622.08] but um why don't we move to twitter we've still got a lot here why don't we burn through some of the
[3622.08 → 3628.72] quick some of the quick discussion topics, so corsair released three gigahertz that's 3000 megahertz
[3628.72 → 3635.28] memory um did you see this yet no okay curiously enough they released it under the vengeance branding
[3635.28 → 3642.40] rather than dominators yeah so they're vengeance modules so they're not using the custom PCB
[3642.40 → 3646.48] they're not using, or they might be using a custom PCB okay that I don't know don't quote me on that
[3646.48 → 3653.84] but they're vengeance modules they are going to be extremely limited production and extreme overclockers
[3653.84 → 3658.96] only need apply because not only do you have to have the three gigahertz memory which is going to be
[3658.96 → 3665.20] really expensive for two four gig dims, but you will also need to have a CPU that can actually handle
[3665.20 → 3671.36] three gigahertz on the uh integrated memory controller and will that they can't all do that will that like
[3671.36 → 3678.64] actually heat up ddr3 probably I can't imagine this is like a stock voltage yeah there's no way
[3678.64 → 3684.00] that's like because ddr3 doesn't heat up that much no but the binning process that's going into
[3685.04 → 3689.12] three gigahertz I don't even want to know that's probably why they're vengeance modules
[3689.92 → 3697.20] because the volume of modules that they would have to build to bin enough three gigahertz kits to ship
[3697.20 → 3701.36] because vengeance are a higher volume part compared to domineer that's probably what happened
[3702.40 → 3707.28] so there you go there's the answer to the question that I couldn't figure out by me yeah yeah someone
[3707.28 → 3712.08] just commented in the twitch chat he's like finally he said something you actually need liquid cooling
[3712.08 → 3716.64] for but I was like yeah you don't really need to cool ram so maybe you will actually have to cool your
[3716.64 → 3722.00] ram I mean these are intended for like liquid nitrogen cooling yeah so they're expecting people to push these
[3722.00 → 3726.80] well beyond three gigahertz oh yeah so that's kind of neat if you're into memory overclocking I think
[3726.80 → 3734.00] very few people are these days though no as far as I know not so much so there's a rumoured oh okay this uh
[3734.00 → 3741.44] oh you know what I wanted to do this I'm going to uh I'm going to go to the Linus tech tips forum and I'm
[3741.44 → 3748.96] going to go to the news section because I do like to check our tech news and reviews section on the forum
[3748.96 → 3756.40] and uh pick out guys who posted news threads that I thought were interesting so our three gigahertz
[3756.40 → 3765.04] memory news post was from same i rebel I don't know whatever I don't know what that is so at only $749.99
[3765.04 → 3772.48] uh this was uh this was posted by one of the members of our forum also there was a post on the AMD
[3772.48 → 3782.56] 7790 and NVIDIA GTX 655 ti that are rumoured to be released at some point so I don't know uh I don't
[3782.56 → 3785.92] know anything about these cards to be perfectly honest I don't know if they're real I don't know
[3785.92 → 3790.00] if they're actually coming but what I would imagine that they are because I don't think there's any new
[3790.00 → 3798.88] architectures coming right now um what I'd imagine they are is they're just overclocked 7770 and uh 650 ti
[3798.88 → 3805.68] probably that makes sense because they both overclock well um like 70 7770 particularly is like
[3805.68 → 3812.00] yeah a beast overclocked so they could just go okay slightly higher power envelope turn the clock
[3812.00 → 3815.92] speed up 7770 is one of my favourite cards to overclock because it's just like
[3818.08 → 3823.44] um so that's probably what's coming on that side now they're likely to line up sort of perfectly with
[3823.44 → 3827.84] each other because they're going to be speed bumps of cards that compare reasonably well although I'd expect
[3827.84 → 3836.80] the 7790 to continue to beat the 655 ti um if that's what they end up being called all this is
[3836.80 → 3840.80] complete speculation and rumours I know nothing about them which is why I can actually talk about them
[3840.80 → 3848.96] right yeah if I knew I wouldn't be able to talk about it um because of our results where our overclocked
[3848.96 → 3855.92] 7770 competes very favourably against the overclocked 650 ti so that's what leads me to believe that
[3855.92 → 3862.80] a higher bin of both versions right would favour AMD so right uh, so there's that one so that one was
[3862.80 → 3872.48] posted by arterial on the forum so let's go ahead and I'm going to like a warrior arterial so he's got
[3872.48 → 3878.40] some sapphire's official Facebook announcement as well as so he's got references to other sites which is
[3878.40 → 3884.48] good we don't want just random rumours that don't refer to anything so that's uh that's exciting so there
[3884.48 → 3892.24] was another one this one was the one aha, so game developers say PlayStation 4 will out power most pcs
[3892.24 → 3898.48] for years to come now when we actually click on it this was started by dragon tail
[3898.48 → 3905.36] that was a bit of a sensationalist headline there because what the game devs actually said if we read
[3905.36 → 3912.56] a little bit further here is recent debate about new console something has developers
[3912.56 → 3918.56] starting to come out and say that the PS4 will outperform entry-level hardware in the pc market
[3919.20 → 3927.60] that includes graphics cards around four gigs of ram for years to come so okay a couple of things here
[3927.60 → 3939.68] um number one is entry-level pc hardware is so far behind high-end pc hardware I mean you look at entry-level
[3939.68 → 3950.56] graphics cards things like a 610 a 610 is still basically a low-end fermi like that was is a 610 I don't think
[3950.56 → 3957.92] 610 is even Kepler I don't think so and even like back when in the 400 series I think they read
[3957.92 → 3963.52] badged 210s at some point and made those 400 series like there's a lot of rebadging that goes on
[3963.52 → 3967.92] happens all the time on the low-end stuff because quite frankly they sell them for so little that it's
[3967.92 → 3972.96] hardly even worth the r d to redevelop the chips the people who are buying these cards are more interested
[3972.96 → 3980.40] in features like multi-monitor than gaming um i I maintain you shouldn't buy a graphics card that's less
[3980.40 → 3984.40] than a hundred dollars if you're spending less than a hundred dollars on a graphics card you might as
[3984.40 → 3990.16] well put it in a piggy bank and save up for a platform upgrade because you can get APU platforms
[3990.16 → 3996.72] you buy a new CPU memory and motherboard for a couple of hundred bucks that are going to outperform an entry-level
[3996.72 → 4001.52] graphics card from either NVIDIA or AMD we have videos from quite a while ago now actually but
[4001.52 → 4007.52] APU videos they do really well yeah like outstanding surprisingly if you want entry-level gaming
[4007.52 → 4012.32] performance don't buy an entry-level gaming graphics card because that isn't what it is bought an APU just
[4012.32 → 4019.92] do it CPU performance is decent it's not it's not on par with intel, but the graphics core is way ahead
[4019.92 → 4024.96] of what intel's delivering right now although Haswell may shift things around a little bit because I was
[4024.96 → 4033.12] looking at the uh the amount of core space that intel is allocating to GPU CPU is like not going up
[4033.12 → 4037.76] at all in terms of the actual size like it's going to be just optimizations from what I can tell but
[4037.76 → 4043.68] then what they're doing on the GPU is they're like doubling it wow like way more die space so that's
[4043.68 → 4049.92] that's exciting well they needed to compete there um so, so anyway so yeah I mean saying something like it
[4049.92 → 4055.12] they'll be competitive with entry I mean Xbox 360 is probably still competitive with entry-level pcs
[4055.12 → 4060.16] that's like a six-year-old console it's like wow how far into your crystal ball did you have to look
[4060.16 → 4066.40] for that with that said the vast majority of people out there are not running gaming computers and that's
[4066.40 → 4071.68] something that we enthusiasts forget about sometimes there's a lot of 8800s there's a lot of 260s there's a
[4071.68 → 4079.52] lot of stuff that's way crappier than that that's true there's a lot of like you know 8600 GTS still
[4079.52 → 4084.80] out there's a lot of 8500s still out there a lot of previous stuff still out there's a lot
[4084.80 → 4090.56] of gamers who are still living at home with their parents using whatever computer their parents bought
[4090.56 → 4096.08] from a big box store one of my like they want to play games but one of my really really perfect
[4096.08 → 4105.60] buddies is running an eco-friendly 8800 that only has one uh PCI Express power plug-in that's exactly
[4105.60 → 4111.68] the same as the regular 8800 there's a little tidbit for you, it was just an uh it was just a revision to
[4111.68 → 4116.80] the core that made it slightly more power efficient its power its performance is exactly the same as a
[4116.80 → 4122.72] non-eco well we've benched it, and they were different that's very strange that's binning or something that happened there
[4122.72 → 4128.88] that's very strange we'll have to look I'll have to look into that outside of the stream
[4128.88 → 4137.52] um but yeah he still plays absolutely everything yep, and you know the reality of it is uh the pcs
[4137.52 → 4142.08] sort of you know the greatest thing about it and the worst thing about it is the flexibility of the
[4142.08 → 4150.00] hardware so you can make a game for pc and if you make a game for 90 of the pcs out there the way blizzard
[4150.00 → 4156.16] do you end up with games like Diablo 3 that look like they're 10 years old but the reality of
[4156.16 → 4162.48] it is that's still a pc game and consoles next generation consoles will be ahead of that level
[4162.48 → 4167.52] for a long time yeah because you can develop for exactly the spec yeah which is nice, so there's
[4167.52 → 4172.80] that optimization that goes on as well um if we don't have anything we should jump on Twitter we
[4172.80 → 4176.56] haven't really been on Twitter yeah sure let's jump on Twitter for a little bit and see if uh
[4176.56 → 4181.76] see if anyone's got any twitter things if I could actually get the window open that would be great
[4182.40 → 4189.20] there we go I do so love this little uh keyboard mouse thing lol my friend got ripped off at fries
[4189.20 → 4195.68] they said 800 watt power supply water cooling etc nope he wasted money on a gt643 gig and that's another
[4195.68 → 4199.92] thing about that statement from the game downs what do you mean a four gigabyte graphics card that doesn't
[4199.92 → 4206.08] mean anything you can put four gigabytes in fact I think someone did put four gigs of memory on a low end
[4206.80 → 4213.36] gt600 series I'm just looking at that come on that card is going to be bottlenecked by the time it
[4213.36 → 4220.72] fills up 512 legs of VRAM because any modern game that actually has high-res textures a turn them off
[4220.72 → 4225.84] because they're not going to run on that card and b you're going to be running at such a low resolution
[4225.84 → 4232.48] you're not going to need the VRAM anyway um we usually mean competitive in terms of performance I think
[4232.48 → 4240.08] rapping that 3200 integrated GPU I think that's an older one from like the express chipsets that's
[4240.08 → 4246.16] not quite the same as an APU just throwing that out there it's me playing games with a 9800 yep 650 ti
[4246.16 → 4252.00] with one or two gigs uh VRAM one gig VRAM is fine for 650 ti this is an interesting
[4252.00 → 4258.08] the t balancer oh can you talk about your t balancer uh I've talked about this on the
[4258.08 → 4263.20] live streams before so I don't want to bore people yeah, but he's saying recommended he's asking if he
[4263.20 → 4266.88] should buy one we've talked about why we liked it we haven't talked about why we don't like if it's
[4266.88 → 4271.84] really hard to configure it's such a pain really hard to even find an English version of the stupid
[4271.84 → 4275.52] software last time I did it which was like a couple of years ago mind you I tried to do it more recently and
[4275.52 → 4280.08] could not get an English version working I think you have to get the German version yeah and then
[4280.08 → 4284.48] you have to figure out how to change it to English within the German version German menus yeah and
[4284.48 → 4289.36] apparently that works so like there's a lot of usability things that are kind of weird but once
[4289.36 → 4295.92] you have it set up it's set and forget you never touch it again I didn't touch it for literally years
[4295.92 → 4299.92] and it just automatically configured everything through multiple rebuilds of my computer i just
[4299.92 → 4303.84] didn't change anything about my t balancer just remembered which fans kind of plugged into what
[4303.84 → 4308.16] yeah and like it's awesome, but you're going to have to fight with it a bit that's all okay we are gonna
[4308.16 → 4312.32] have a featured rig from the forums a featured build log but I don't I don't want to click on anything
[4312.88 → 4318.64] in twitter right now just in case it's like goats or something I'm trying to OC my 7770s but can only
[4318.64 → 4322.64] get a small overclock you got way higher try turning up the voltage that might be something
[4324.72 → 4329.44] oh, oh you know what I think I might have made a mistake pc computer geek might be right we usually line
[4329.44 → 4338.32] up 7770 with the non-ti don't we yes but then I is lined up with do we even I don't remember okay
[4338.32 → 4345.84] you'll have to check that out I'll get that one sec um no we yeah no he's right because it's 650 I'm
[4345.84 → 4350.32] just do we even run 650 ti I don't think we do so there you go we were totally wrong in that whole
[4350.32 → 4357.92] discussion about that any giveaways today probably no giveaways today yeah we run 650 660 660 ti and 670.
[4357.92 → 4363.28] is the Aries 2 all sold probably ATI can only use physics by running calculations about the CPU
[4363.28 → 4368.64] how much of an impact on fps is this well a lot of games it's like kneecapped by the way that physics
[4368.64 → 4375.52] is implemented so yeah you never explained cherry MX green switches in your mechanical keyboard tech
[4375.52 → 4380.32] quickie video can you explain its advantages and disadvantages it's basically a heavier blue
[4380.32 → 4385.68] and the reason we didn't talk about it was because find a keyboard that actually has okay I know there are
[4385.68 → 4391.28] some, but they're very well yeah, but that's not even out, yet we're not they're not even supposed
[4391.28 → 4395.84] to be talking to us about that you're going to get them in trouble they previewed at cis they previewed
[4395.84 → 4401.76] it at CES, but there are very few keyboards out there with cherry MX green, and it may gain some
[4401.76 → 4406.08] popularity moving forward, but they are more expensive, and they are much less rare than the
[4406.08 → 4413.20] usual blue red brown black key switches they have it on their website as new do they're 99 bucks okay well
[4413.20 → 4418.00] there you go okay apparently 99 only is that a tank list oh yeah that's an expensive tank list then
[4418.80 → 4423.76] yeah that's still the keyboard with green switches all right exciting he just said they're heavier blues
[4423.76 → 4429.92] they also have a more accurate actuation point blues have a slight problem that people and like okay this
[4429.92 → 4436.56] I use exclusively blues on everything um, but blues have a slight problem where if you float right under the
[4436.56 → 4443.04] click you can um hit the actuation point repeatedly, so there's double tapping issues that people will
[4443.04 → 4447.60] have if they're trying to click really quickly where they'll accidentally go back down before they
[4447.60 → 4454.32] click, and they'll actuate it too many times, so the actuation point is not exactly on the click
[4454.32 → 4461.28] greens is way more accurate in that aspect in blues now in saying these blues are pretty darn accurate like
[4461.28 → 4466.08] you're not going to have you're not going to have this problem that often, but that is a notable
[4466.08 → 4473.20] difference is the greens do have a more accurate click and actuation point level okay a little bit
[4473.20 → 4479.36] more twitter uh is it worth it to oh uh corsair 200r is a good budget case uh we're using one for our
[4479.36 → 4484.56] video capture pc that we're running on right now is it worth it to get a big bang 2 that supports 128 gigabytes
[4484.56 → 4490.56] of ram I don't know if I would run out where are you going to get 128 gigs of ram on a x79 you need 16 gig dims
[4491.12 → 4499.52] so good luck with that wait rumours of those are they coming soon none 16 gig dims rumours okay i
[4499.52 → 4504.80] don't know I've just read spending a fortune on it by the time you spent that much on 16 gig dims
[4504.80 → 4509.68] if this is for a video editing and rendering station get yourself a dual socket super micro board
[4510.24 → 4515.68] throw a couple of eons in there and then get lower density eight gig dims and fill it up just fill it
[4515.68 → 4520.32] up, and then you can get your 128 gigs of ram and get more processing power in a proper workstation
[4520.32 → 4526.72] platform at the same time probably for a fairly uh not at the price 16 gig dims will probably be
[4526.72 → 4532.00] yeah exactly a fairly competitive price it'll probably be cheaper yeah yeah to be honest Linus
[4532.00 → 4536.72] wanted to get your opinion should I wait for the 900d or get something now like a phantom 630 phantom 630
[4536.72 → 4543.60] is not very comparable to the 900d I mean 900d is a monster 630 is quite like it's a mid-tower, and it's like
[4543.60 → 4548.48] full steel and aluminum isn't it yeah it's like full metal for the 900d whereas a very plastic design
[4548.48 → 4554.24] for the 630 I think you need to decide exactly what you want and then decide what to buy I'd probably
[4554.24 → 4563.20] go with a 79 50 or a 660 ti I mean that's a good uh 34 70 maybe a 660. 660 is a great value or a 78 70
[4563.20 → 4569.60] or 78 50. When is slick going to upload videos to his YouTube channel that is for that channel that you see
[4569.60 → 4575.20] when I comment on YouTube videos is for replying to comments on YouTube videos I am not planning on
[4575.20 → 4580.40] releasing anything on that channel uh slick's personal rig has been updated yep uh people asked
[4580.40 → 4584.24] you to talk about your personal rig, and we never talked about it during the Windows 8 thing okay um
[4584.24 → 4594.32] I'm running I'm water cooling with a t-virus and a 120.3 um pa 120.3 donated by someone very gracious
[4594.32 → 4605.76] uh I'm running a 2600k and moving to a GTX 670 water cooled so it's very it's very short yeah it's
[4605.76 → 4611.68] really short mini card it's literally about this looks tiny in the 800d it's a little bit
[4611.68 → 4617.60] ridiculous um but it actually kind of works for my water loop yeah because it'll be in the right
[4617.60 → 4623.12] position so you won't have to re plummet and buy new tubing so it actually kind of works um
[4624.40 → 4628.56] I have a lot of I don't want to do a personal rig update video because I have a lot of work on that
[4628.56 → 4634.00] rig that I need to do before I want to release a personal update video uh the mineral oil rig had
[4634.00 → 4640.40] enough novelty in it that it was just kind of awesome um but like currently I love the power supply
[4640.40 → 4642.96] that's there's like junk growing in his loop, and he doesn't want to show you guys
[4642.96 → 4649.60] actually that goes away and comes back because of the silver fittings right now it's not there
[4649.60 → 4654.40] is it not there right now no that's weird, but it comes back it's the silver fittings it cleans it and
[4654.40 → 4659.68] then gets dirty it's because I don't think I have enough if I had silver fittings on my d5
[4660.88 → 4667.68] okay I think it would be enough I think my rig has like eight silver fittings in it yeah six yeah okay
[4667.68 → 4672.80] um if and adding in that graphics card might actually solve it okay if I add two more silver
[4672.80 → 4677.36] fittings there that might actually fix my problem okay or I could just add a kill coil or something
[4677.36 → 4682.40] but anyway uh I still need to like sleeve my power supply yeah your power supply looks ghetto it's a
[4682.40 → 4687.28] high current ugly it's an awesome power supply yeah high current pro 1200 watt or something ridiculous
[4687.28 → 4695.28] like that beast and like unnecessary but whatever um but totally beast and ugly hideous so I need to
[4695.28 → 4702.56] sleeve that um I'm in a 800d but like it's the front looks horrible it's a little bit broken there's some
[4702.56 → 4709.52] scratches like I need to be done like it's really beat up um one of my roommates that I had who was
[4709.52 → 4717.28] often under the influence utilized the cardboard panels from the box for my 800d to build something
[4718.56 → 4725.44] I was I came home and I'm just like what and this was like weeks afterwards because I just had the box
[4725.44 → 4729.92] for it in the back room and never really thought about it right and I'm like okay well I can't transport my
[4729.92 → 4736.16] 800d in a box anymore which is so heavy which is insanely really hard to move around and like have
[4736.16 → 4741.92] it not like if it's like once it gains momentum if it starts moving in the back of the car it's
[4741.92 → 4747.68] going to smack and then that creates scratches so like it's its a 800d, but it's like probably one of the
[4747.68 → 4753.92] least attractive 800d's in existence not really um, but it's its not doing so great it's down there it's
[4753.92 → 4757.20] down there it's definitely down there so that needs to be replaced I need to just leave my cables like
[4757.20 → 4760.40] there's work that needs to be done before I want to release, but you're saving for a car
[4761.12 → 4764.96] I'm saving up for a car he's saving for a car so he can drive me around for a change instead of the
[4764.96 → 4772.48] other way around yeah so like it's going to be a while but yeah that's that's my rig can we put like um
[4772.48 → 4778.72] like benchmarked slash programmer slash chauffeur on your business cards when we have them printed
[4778.72 → 4783.20] oh my god we have to do that that would be so amazing that would be perfect we have to have
[4783.20 → 4789.28] chauffeur we should have leaky chauffeur you'll have to yeah his car now actually the roof
[4789.28 → 4794.08] leaks it's a Pontiac which should be all you need to know it's a convertible in bc it got cold and it
[4794.08 → 4799.76] cracked it's a Pontiac it's an old car it probably leaked at the beginning no no no, no no it's an old
[4799.76 → 4805.44] car why do you defend the Pontiac because I like that car what is good about everything about it is
[4805.44 → 4813.36] terrible it doesn't even have cupholders that's stupid it's good what do you mean it's a convertible
[4813.36 → 4820.88] you don't need cupholders anything slides with you, I was hoping you wouldn't notice that that's
[4820.88 → 4827.12] that's like I can't even compare that to anything that's like saying it's its an it's an it's an it's
[4827.12 → 4833.12] it's a rancher it doesn't need uh windows my first car it's got me around, and it's awesome in the summer
[4833.12 → 4838.64] it's amazingly awesome in the summer you know the cruise around with the top down in the summer
[4838.64 → 4847.04] when it's hot it's just kind of awesome okay Pontiac whatever your car really runs oh I need to change
[4847.04 → 4855.60] gears okay we're still moving well maybe if I wasn't driving your huge ass around everywhere
[4856.16 → 4862.32] my car would still run it was broken you weigh about double what I do what I thought we figured out
[4862.32 → 4871.84] and actually no yeah whatever you look like you weigh about twice as hard to look at there bam, bam
[4874.48 → 4879.28] what was I going to say I don't care I can't even remember whatever something about your stupid car
[4879.28 → 4886.00] I like my car um something about your personal rig oh yeah you're saving up for a car so you're not
[4886.00 → 4890.16] going to do all the upgrades right away yeah but I am planning like eventually all this will
[4890.16 → 4895.92] happen and then I will eventually release a rig update but like I wouldn't, I wouldn't hold up for
[4895.92 → 4903.04] it uh new slash more fans for my pc or save up for a GTX 680 lightning I don't know if your computer's
[4903.04 → 4907.28] really loud I've done cooling upgrades as opposed to performance upgrades, but it really depends what
[4907.28 → 4912.72] video card you're running now although 680 lightning isn't necessarily the best choice unless you want to
[4912.72 → 4919.92] run 3d vision or in videos uh or rather uh 3d vision or phys or figure out what games you play
[4919.92 → 4924.48] and then check out some of our videos yeah 79 70 may end up being a better choice for you like something
[4924.48 → 4932.16] like an um shoot what's that Asus one the matrix one matrix 79 70 is awesome card we did a NCI tech tips
[4932.16 → 4937.76] quite a while ago showing that even without the never settle driver it was already the fastest single card
[4937.76 → 4942.80] went overclocked to the max, and we ran into gains to 680 lightning and the never settle driver is like
[4943.68 → 4948.40] kind of big deal yeah kind of a huge deal Sean contributes that Windows 8 has been super shady on
[4948.40 → 4953.52] his grandmother's new computer apparently to run some Microsoft games in Windows 8 you need a new app
[4953.52 → 4958.88] and steam's not providing it so that might be something for you to look into I'm uh we're probably
[4958.88 → 4964.48] not going to do a video on OC basics because we do specific videos on mix tech tips for every new
[4964.48 → 4968.72] platform anyway so just go check out our overclocking guides over there, and you should
[4969.84 → 4976.48] pick up pretty much most of what you need to know my mouse isn't working oh there it goes yay it's back
[4977.20 → 4982.00] honestly the Windows 8 comments like the usability of different things is like I was able to deal with
[4982.00 → 4987.92] that it's the monitor randomly inverting and going black right that I'm not able to deal with because
[4987.92 → 4992.56] like I've died so many times in games just because I'm like oh I have a black screen I can't do anything
[4992.56 → 4997.68] for six or seven seconds and in a lot of games when you can't do anything for six or seven seconds
[4997.68 → 5003.60] you're kind of screwed um okay a little bit more twitter q a so Robert asks if his FX 8350 showing
[5003.60 → 5009.52] four physical cores and eight logical cores on task manager is normal and it I don't know is that normal
[5009.52 → 5015.60] because pile driver pile driver modules have been sort of like a core and a half yeah they're
[5015.60 → 5021.28] they're funky, but it's not quite like not a core at all the way hyper threading is so it's probably
[5021.28 → 5025.68] normal as long as it shows eight logical then it should be fine by the way uh slick's defence
[5027.52 → 5031.84] so basically my car is a Ferrari it's a Pontiac Ferrari built by Pontiac
[5034.80 → 5040.24] slick can drive to wreck beach in his convertible Pontiac exactly that is how classy
[5040.24 → 5050.16] convertible Pontiac is bam and welcome lime fire the Lexus LA has no cupholders, and it's an amazing
[5050.16 → 5054.96] car don't judge a car by its cupholders okay, okay how about this how about the fact that the Pontiac
[5054.96 → 5060.64] has no cupholders and isn't an amazing car how about the cupholders are just one thing for me to
[5060.64 → 5070.08] pick on in like 20 years all it's needed is new spark plugs okay bam and pretty good runs great
[5070.08 → 5076.72] and a serious like non-suckitude makeover uh is slick a family member how is he always with you works me
[5076.72 → 5082.64] way too much yeah that's pretty much it I'm not getting paid right now actually you're not no, no
[5082.64 → 5085.92] although you're salaried so technically you are getting paid right now just not very much
[5085.92 → 5096.24] just like tiny are you planning a project car I can't imagine you're not that mechanically
[5096.24 → 5103.52] inclined are you I do okay I do all right my dad is and then i kind of get some from there my dad's
[5103.52 → 5109.04] kind of wizard when it comes to anything um Chris I don't think we need more heat sink manufacturers
[5109.68 → 5114.16] I think sight exiting the North American market was sort of all we needed to know they had good
[5114.16 → 5120.72] yeah good unique products and couldn't make it over here because we have enough heat sink manufacturers
[5121.52 → 5129.44] be quiet recently moved over even yeah they did recently is hum I have a blah blah blah yep
[5129.44 → 5133.92] definitely go for it Richard do you think Samsung's features are actually useful or just bloatware
[5133.92 → 5137.60] ruining android what monitor are you going to use now that your old one broke
[5138.72 → 5141.12] my mother always told me if you don't have anything nice to say
[5141.12 → 5150.96] don't say anything skip over it and address the next question um I am I don't know he's thinking
[5150.96 → 5156.40] about a Leonidas yeah I'm looking into the Leonidas I'm thinking about getting repaired I would love to
[5156.40 → 5165.36] drop like five grand on sharps 32-inch 4k monitor but I think my wife would kill me like absolutely kill me
[5165.36 → 5174.00] so um yeah I don't know yet if I can repair the 305t for a reasonable price then I'll do that in all
[5174.00 → 5179.12] likelihood just tuned in from England yay hi England uh my main question with the t balancers can it
[5179.12 → 5184.88] actually switch the fans off absolutely the fan curves are fully configurable and fully actually work
[5184.88 → 5189.28] although I'd recommend using voltage control and I probably wouldn't recommend using PWM fans
[5189.28 → 5193.68] have you thought of combining forces with 10 syndicate or do you plan to continue to be
[5193.68 → 5198.40] competitors 10 syndicate well Logan's on the east coast, and we're on the west coast so unless
[5198.40 → 5204.56] hard yeah unless one of us was planning to move I don't think we'd be like merging our companies
[5204.56 → 5209.68] because he's running his own business now too much the same way that I am um however I really don't see
[5209.68 → 5215.12] us as competitor slogan's awesome we like yeah we like Logan like a lot I mean we've emailed him
[5215.12 → 5219.36] we like twitter chatted with him, I've never met him in person unfortunately but I'm hoping to at some
[5219.36 → 5228.48] point but uh yeah we guys hey go subscribe raise the world with a zero not a no um on YouTube tech
[5228.48 → 5233.60] syndicate go subscribe because Logan's a good guy and his format is so different from ours it's good i
[5233.60 → 5240.32] mean I like it, we both do benchmarks, but his new show is much more structured it's more of a recorded show
[5240.32 → 5249.60] whereas our new show is like live q an um subscribing to both channels yeah have that much of a content
[5249.60 → 5254.08] style overlap, and you would probably if and you'll get a couple different perspectives yeah it's cool
[5254.08 → 5260.16] I get mine slick slogan's uh subscribe to Paul hardware as well as uh awesome sauce news
[5260.16 → 5269.60] that's kyle from new egg yeah all good guys uh okay let's see 520 watt 80 plus platinum is that the uh
[5269.60 → 5274.80] the passive one if so good work Melvin because the passive one is cool boss you know what I figured
[5274.80 → 5281.28] out I think that one is built on the same platform as the SFX thousand watt platinum that I'm using
[5281.28 → 5287.92] yeah yeah you told me about that and the fans on my radiator are air penetrators so they're directed
[5287.92 → 5293.28] airflow so if i at least have that one running a little bit I will can have no fan at all in my power
[5293.28 → 5297.76] supply because 520 watts is lots for what I'm doing in fact is it 520 or 550
[5299.20 → 5307.36] 5 520 yeah I can see if it's over there uh how about how is pump rattle in the h100 uh neither of
[5307.36 → 5314.80] our h100s is bad yeah i you I owned an IBM model m for a little while and then someone took it back from
[5314.80 → 5323.28] me after I cleaned it up how many Canadian viewers do you have I don't know four hundred ten thousand
[5324.32 → 5330.96] forty-two five six first time I watched the stream in real time all right can't pronounce your name
[5330.96 → 5338.56] but that's cool is a SLI config of 660 non-ti okay you know what probably not a bad idea 660 is not that
[5338.56 → 5343.92] far behind the ti and as long as you don't need the extra VRAM of getting a higher end card with more video
[5343.92 → 5348.40] memory you should be able to get a pretty significant performance boost to the tune of
[5349.28 → 5356.56] better than you would do by selling a 660 and getting a 670 or something like that um dark gin
[5356.56 → 5363.12] it's not nine night classic start I just download classic start I think it's classic shell for windows
[5363.12 → 5371.04] 8 from the nine night website just want to clarify that uh I'm only 13 I'm not posting strange pictures
[5371.04 → 5373.68] yeah I was a perfect angel on the internet when I was 13 too
[5376.00 → 5381.20] either way we don't want to risk it because yeah we've clicked on stuff that kind of killed people's
[5381.20 → 5388.64] ears before Tim already knows the answer nff12 Logan likes one of your CEST he likes one of our CEST
[5388.64 → 5393.44] we did like 50 what a jerk good enough don't subscribe to Logan I take back everything
[5393.44 → 5398.48] I said before about subscribing to Logan I don't even care I still like Logan whatever man okay let's see
[5398.48 → 5405.60] if we've got oh VGA released their utility for changing the lighting yes 690 and titan so you can
[5406.64 → 5411.04] lower the brightness increase the brightness you can set it to breathing mode which is
[5411.04 → 5416.80] like I love breathing mode for LEDs which is awesome although what I think I would probably do if I was
[5416.80 → 5423.84] balling enough to have a titan is I would set it up depending on GPU load it can go brighter or dimmer so
[5423.84 → 5429.20] cool so cool that's the kind of stuff that really makes me geek out that's awesome I love stuff like
[5429.20 → 5435.92] that that's why I like um uh tactical tracers crucial tactical tracers ram I tried to install
[5435.92 → 5440.64] the application on my computer it just says unsupported motherboard I haven't done a bios update
[5440.64 → 5445.60] though it's still running bios v1, and it's running that weird Leon chipset it's running a workstation
[5445.60 → 5452.80] chipset so I might try taking the modules putting them in a x79 or like a z68 board and then moving
[5452.80 → 5457.20] the back over because I think it's saved on the modules themselves I think so but I think so i
[5457.20 → 5463.44] don't quote either of us on that yeah we don't we don't actually know oh there what was I
[5463.44 → 5468.40] going to say yeah and in combination that would have to be pretty cool oh that'd be so cool
[5470.24 → 5475.12] I'd probably want to do like a LED colour swap on the titan though like if they're doing you could
[5475.12 → 5478.08] probably do it because you could take the green out of the cooler and probably put in blue I bet it's
[5478.08 → 5485.92] not even a coloured led looking at that colour that's not a green LED colour that'd be that looks so good
[5485.92 → 5494.56] like blue GTX that would be cool uh speaking of like mods and rigs and stuff like that I'm actually
[5494.56 → 5499.52] just you should probably not have you sending myself oh yeah guys please don't read my emails
[5500.48 → 5505.20] uh I don't think there's anything here that's that bad, but you've got stuff from like from people so
[5505.20 → 5510.00] their names are there and stuff yeah they might care about that that email from that guy is like
[5510.00 → 5515.20] the most bizarre thing that uh that I've seen in a while I don't even see if it's uh they want us to
[5515.20 → 5522.00] promote some contest or something to win like a TV or something can we talk about the I have no
[5522.00 → 5526.64] idea what you're talking about I don't know if I can talk about here I'll type it one sec are you drunk
[5526.64 → 5533.60] no I just don't know how to describe this sure yeah go for it um I don't even know who it is
[5533.60 → 5539.12] it's uh it's uh oh crap you know what let's just save it then because I can't remember who now they're
[5539.12 → 5545.04] all going to be like what uh we'll talk we'll talk about it later okay, okay so let's do our featured
[5545.04 → 5552.24] build log of the week from the Linus tech tips' forum, so our featured build log is from Joris
[5552.24 → 5559.36] wait a minute didn't we already feature this did we uh oh what you're talking about Willis did we
[5561.12 → 5567.04] you have to log in all right I have to log in to see images uh I can't change that I'm sorry
[5568.16 → 5574.32] I think we already featured this one okay well Joris you're on again because it's too late for me to
[5574.32 → 5587.20] fix it now um uh, uh I had other competitors okay yeah was very rushed today okay I don't remember my
[5587.20 → 5591.36] password for the forum right now so we're not at our best right now here guys
[5594.40 → 5601.68] there we go I'm logged in was this the first one I think yeah i we definitely featured this
[5601.68 → 5607.20] one of those were the completed pictures anyway way to go did you show the wrong pictures when we
[5607.20 → 5612.88] actually featured no oh I might not have showed I might not have showed all the pictures okay fine
[5612.88 → 5617.76] we'll just we're just going to feature York again go to the very last, and we're going to go to the very
[5617.76 → 5629.76] end of his build log okay all right there it goes okay so we're gonna look at his build properly this
[5629.76 → 5634.56] time so slick why don't you cover everything that's good about it here you can use this to uh
[5635.12 → 5641.36] yeah this was apparently featured before sorry guys this was very last minute we didn't have internet
[5641.36 → 5647.04] in the office today that was so fail like and so fail I had to try and find a build log so I was
[5647.04 → 5652.88] trying to find build logs without pictures which is like kind of hard to do you just have to go based
[5652.88 → 5658.08] on memory of build logs you've seen before that are good so i was well I was reading the comments
[5658.08 → 5663.20] and trying to figure out what was going on with this one and I was like this sounds awesome so went
[5663.20 → 5668.72] with this and that apparently didn't work out too great um tell us about the rig though that looks
[5668.72 → 5674.80] awesome it looks amazing it's based on like crop circles that's why it's called phenomenon so kind of
[5674.80 → 5678.96] cool naming to go along with your style a lot of planning that went into this if you look into
[5678.96 → 5686.80] earlier posts like he gets into actually um what uh like I think it's called drafting I don't know if
[5686.80 → 5692.08] that's the official name for what he did specifically, but he drafted out like what he was going to do
[5692.08 → 5697.76] for this crop circle and like the rest of the design of the case um a lot of really, really cool mods that
[5697.76 → 5704.24] went into this it's very clean like you can even see that picture right there that is incredibly clean
[5704.24 → 5712.88] that's outstanding this I never saw so there you go um he uses and pc sleeving md pc oh I'm thinking
[5712.88 → 5719.76] million dollar pc um like just insanely clean everything about it is clean but I love the white
[5719.76 → 5725.28] fittings yeah I was just going to say the white fittings are awesome um the sleeving situation he has
[5725.28 → 5729.36] going on is fascinating because a lot of people will go with nice patterns and stuff like one
