[0.00 → 9.48] uh okay so have we actually been streaming anything because we've been
[9.48 → 18.96] we've been here the entire time live streams not on what the fuck um and I
[18.96 → 24.12] really don't know what's going on because twitch is telling us for streaming
[24.12 → 33.72] online online online online online how long were we gone for okay so
[33.72 → 38.10] we're looking at the twitch chat right now like how long were we how long
[38.10 → 51.96] were we gone for half a what 26 minutes no way we just started yeah I just saw
[51.96 → 58.26] Harrison he's watching he said you just started we've been talking for like 25
[58.26 → 64.86] minutes thinking we were live here is exactly what X split looked like we were
[64.86 → 72.14] we were streaming very much streaming and apparently that was not that was not a
[72.14 → 79.42] thing that was working for us so okay yeah apparently we were never live but I
[79.42 → 83.80] thought I thought I read someone saying something about something that
[83.80 → 86.92] explains why when we were started already someone said we were one minute late
[86.92 → 92.08] because I didn't think we were yeah that's hilarious we were on time this week I
[92.08 → 99.72] know we were actually on time this week so looking at um here sort by date
[99.72 → 108.10] where's our two one so we only have a five Meg file for our initial attempt to
[108.10 → 117.78] stream I think so we were live for oh no this is now that we're back already so okay
[117.78 → 126.96] sorry guys um you're on a weird scene yeah we're here what have we talked about so far
[126.96 → 131.34] we talked about SSD update that we filmed at work today okay well why don't we start
[131.34 → 141.18] with that because like oh okay it's okay so here guys we're sorry we're late we had no
[141.18 → 147.18] idea we were late we turned on streaming, and then we were like we were going so we
[147.18 → 152.58] weren't doing any Twitter questions or anything like that we had absolutely no idea
[152.58 → 160.46] that we were not live at any point in time during the last uh during the last 25 minutes so really
[160.46 → 167.40] really sorry about that uh let's go ahead and put Twitter back up there Linus the stream is not
[167.40 → 173.96] streaming finally live uh okay so we'll start explains why when I checked um when you went to go get
[173.96 → 178.02] your boots I went up to check Twitter and there were two tweets, and I was like why aren't you guys
[178.02 → 183.60] tweeting Linus everybody tweet Linus and then no tweets came in right yeah you know it's funny
[183.60 → 188.82] because I thought we had no technical difficulties tonight we had audio working we had video working
[188.82 → 195.30] I'm actually getting kind of sick of xsplit says it's streaming and just isn't that's what
[195.30 → 202.44] pisses me off I mean okay yeah we have 1700 viewers now if I'd looked and seen that we had zero viewers
[202.44 → 206.58] still 25 minutes into a live stream, but sometimes it takes a really long time to update right I mean
[206.58 → 211.50] I wasn't watching, and it sucks to be like oh is everything okay oh yeah it's okay and then keep
[211.50 → 218.70] talking like it should just work the crazy thing is when I was doing that one little random streaming
[218.70 → 225.60] test yeah um I had to start XSplit and then stop it and then start XSplit, and then it would work
[225.60 → 231.14] it would never work we've never had this problem before no I know but upstairs see that's okay so those of
[231.14 → 235.52] you who are wondering why we always have problems it's always a different problem that's the issue
[235.52 → 242.02] every time we have a problem, and we fix it then we're like yeah we know for next time, and then we're
[242.02 → 247.70] all like fist bump don't worry we got this next time, and then it's like something different like one
[247.70 → 255.14] of the days um one of the one of the SLR what's the one of the SLR inputs on the xa10 camera is dead so
[255.14 → 260.48] one of the days that happened while we were trying to film a live stream so we're like everyone's like no
[260.48 → 266.18] audio no audio the port died how are we supposed to know we always use that port the port died what
[266.18 → 270.26] do you want me to do for reference it's the port that's closest to the back of the camera so by
[270.26 → 274.46] default you just shove it in that port all the time because yeah this makes most sense, and it wasn't a
[274.46 → 278.78] software thing we even had diesel look at it after the fact I mean that's part of the problem too is
[278.78 → 284.66] it's usually me and slick doing this not diesel so okay we had a long day of shooting NCI tech tips
[284.66 → 290.00] today so we got a bunch of cool episodes done one of them was we did a new SSD update so this time we're
[290.00 → 296.12] talking about the Samsung 840 and the Samsung 840 Pro so if you guys don't know already basically
[296.12 → 305.06] these SSDs are balling or less balling but like a good value, so the 840 Pro is pretty much as fast
[305.06 → 310.94] as it gets it's got a five-year warranty it was sat atop our performance charts yep if I recall correctly
[310.94 → 317.30] and I mean it's just it's Samsung everything about it is Samsung, so there's an inherent sort of trust level
[317.30 → 321.68] there I think that comes along with that and it is just straight up looks good oh yeah Samsung's really
[321.68 → 326.48] good at making good-looking stuff and their SSDs are just beautiful yeah it's just like got a nice
[326.48 → 332.00] sort of metal finish on it, and then it's got one orange spot and black and orange is like pretty
[332.00 → 339.74] that's sort of pretty boss yeah it just looks good yeah and then the 840 what's special about that is
[339.74 → 345.68] not so much the performance crown it still performs really well, but it's the first consumer SSD to use TLC
[345.68 → 353.96] flash now TLC flash was traditionally USB drive territory because it wasn't reliable enough to use in a
[353.96 → 359.36] performance application so while it does suffer a bit in terms of write speeds are you just checking
[359.36 → 369.14] the twitch chat oh yeah oh crap we don't have an echo do we doesn't look like it okay are you sure
[369.14 → 377.30] doesn't look like it okay because I see a thing here oh nothing we can do about audio pops right now I don't think
[377.30 → 384.44] hello everyone so it's the first one to use TLC flash which means that higher densities lower
[384.44 → 390.44] prices in the longer run as well as Samsung's claim that what they've done with this drive is they've
[390.44 → 395.72] validated TLC flash to the point where it's usable in a performance application so read speeds are still
[395.72 → 400.16] outstanding but right speeds are a little bit slower however the thing to be aware of is that if
[400.16 → 408.72] you're a gamer or a general desktop user the odds that even 20% of the operations that you do on an
[408.72 → 415.46] SSD are rights like that and most of your rights are going to be big ones like games or programs yeah where
[415.46 → 422.80] it's like okay so okay I just got a long discussion we had before we realized absolutely nobody was
[422.80 → 430.42] watching it was uh Slick's challenge to me that I should tell him my favourite piece of software
[430.42 → 435.84] well we were talking about random stuff and I kind of we were talking about SSDs so whenever I talk about
[435.84 → 440.60] SSDs I'm thinking about new computer builds so what one I would want to put in different price computers
[440.60 → 445.18] and whatnot so then I started thinking about Finite and Finite is my favourite program, so I asked him
[445.18 → 449.76] what his favourite program well hold on what you said before was piece of software yeah I maintain
[449.76 → 454.44] Finite's not really a piece of software it's a script would you call a script software would you call
[454.44 → 462.36] a script software oh come on that's like me saying that I had a really cool uh you know washing machine
[462.36 → 468.52] because it has like a programmable cycle and so that's my favourite piece of software is the software
[468.52 → 473.22] on the washing machine okay that's completely different how is it completely different all Finite
[473.22 → 478.32] does it's not just a script also how is it not just a script they program in specific stuff for
[478.32 → 483.60] each one that's why they don't just have a bazillion you can have a script that programs in specific of
[483.60 → 491.00] course it has script, but there's also core software to it a UI is not a script okay, but an installer is
[491.00 → 498.50] not necessarily a UI there's still a UI to it, I think that I think that I think the washing machine
[498.50 → 505.94] example holds because that software someone coded if it's not just pure scripts it has a UI okay so
[505.94 → 509.96] is your favourite program your washing machine my clothes wouldn't be clean without it is your
[509.96 → 514.28] favourite program you're watching no, but that's my point is your favourite program can't be Finite any
[514.28 → 518.48] more than my favourite program can be my washing machine that's ridiculous it's not ridiculous come
[518.48 → 522.86] up with a real program it's a program why don't you think about one that's like a legitimate program or
[522.86 → 529.40] are you programist yeah that's not a thing okay well the one that I came up with that
[529.40 → 535.78] I think actually is a legitimate okay because you asked piece of software yeah I would not consider
[535.78 → 542.72] like the uh you know the macro functionality on a mouse to be a piece of software okay whatever piece
[542.72 → 547.66] of software the connotation of it I'm holding Finite I'll show my other one that I showed when we
[547.66 → 554.50] weren't streaming to anyone but that's just a function that's like a feature of another piece
[554.50 → 560.08] of software okay you know what fine my favourite piece of software is Windows Home Server because
[560.08 → 565.60] unlike pretty much anything else it actually legitimately made my life better it allowed me to take sort of
[565.60 → 571.48] random hard drives like really random I think I even had 120 gig drives in it before I knew you
[571.48 → 578.80] yeah like ancient stuff that's pretty legit yeah like I had yes I did I had two Max store Diamond
[578.80 → 582.58] Max nines that's the only drive I've ever killed was a Max store that was the one that slipped out of my
[582.58 → 588.58] hand oh nice okay well these were old drives these were SATA 1 back when instead of it
[588.58 → 595.30] being a native SATA controller SATA drives were just IDE drives with a SATA bridge chip so the actual
[595.30 → 603.76] performance bottleneck that didn't exist even then ATA 133 is still almost fast enough for any modern
[603.76 → 610.12] drive something like a WD green three terabytes I think peaks at 125 megabytes per second reads and
[610.12 → 617.86] writes ATA 133 is the ridiculous thing is that we replace it with SATA and then now SATA is almost done but
[617.86 → 623.98] it's because of SSDs I mean ATA would have been held back big time oh yeah of course, but it's just funny how fast that would be
[623.98 → 633.46] yeah SATA is hilarious it's like SATA 150 ATA 100 and 133 yay same thing so anyway I had those in there so
[633.46 → 638.92] what Windows Home Server was it was a way you could mix and match drives and have safe redundant
[638.92 → 645.28] storage, so I and I tested it time and time again because I kept using like random old crappy drives and
[645.28 → 650.22] return drives in it and I kept failing, but I kept not losing any data because of the way that the drive
[650.22 → 655.92] pool worked it was an easy way to manage all of your computers remotely so you could just have one
[655.92 → 661.74] port open UPnP sets it up for you, you don't even have to think about it versus the amount of drinking
[661.74 → 668.28] around in your router and in your OS's or installing you know different applications on the computers for
[668.28 → 673.26] remote access don't have to worry about any of that it's just all native remote desktop connection and it
[673.26 → 677.88] just splits everything out from the one computer and the web portal for accessing your files from
[677.88 → 682.12] anywhere so much better than most NAS's any NAS pretty much that in my opinion was the coolest
[682.12 → 688.98] part just the fact that it worked just like browsing a folder on Windows, and then you transfer files and I
[688.98 → 693.42] mean the only thing I didn't like is if you had a really, really big transfer it just said like
[693.42 → 699.64] transferring files and give you no bar so you had no idea how long far along it was part of the
[699.64 → 704.74] problem was that at the time Slick was using the Windows home server to upload completed Tech Tips
[704.74 → 711.18] episodes off of my horrible archaic internet connection like 512 kilobits up 50 50 kilobit
[711.18 → 717.56] 50 that was the really, really old one we had we've had two-step ups since then are you sure that's when
[717.56 → 723.22] we were on Telus we've had two steps ups since then that's oh that's awful then we moved to Shaw so we got to
[723.22 → 727.66] whatever and then we yeah so not having a progress bar would have been a problem yeah because it would take
[727.66 → 731.22] like the entire night right to upload one video like literally would take the entire night to
[731.22 → 736.32] upload one video or an entire day I mean on the topic of NAS especially back then even a gigabit
[736.32 → 742.12] NAS was going to do 20 30 megabytes per second file copies whereas a Windows home server it's a freaking
[742.12 → 747.80] computer it's fast so yeah it takes care of that stuff all right you can show them what you
[747.80 → 754.54] think passes for this is cool software anyone who does any web development stuff will probably
[754.54 → 762.44] appreciate this if you just go into web developer on Firefox but onto their inspect tool this will
[762.44 → 767.50] be a little bit more I'll go to yeah go to the forum yeah do do you one second
[767.50 → 773.00] something that has actually more things on the page
[773.00 → 781.82] it's going slow why are you going slow right now haha someone's saying you Firefox in the twitch
[781.82 → 789.70] chat you just got burned whatever you got burned like fire whatever, but you're pretty foxy all right
[789.70 → 794.62] so if you go into inspect view most people if you work with web stuff will know what inspect view is
[794.62 → 800.74] so you can see all the different elements then if you click on 3d view you can see all the different
[800.74 → 804.34] elements instead of just highlighting them you can actually see how they stack on each other
[804.34 → 809.26] and you can click on each individual one show them that module where you figured out that it was
[809.26 → 814.84] just like a huge problem because it was like a bazillion dependencies that's changed has it changed yeah
[814.84 → 821.08] okay it's not ridiculous okay so you can see if a module like if it's going to be easy to repair
[821.08 → 826.42] something because you can see how many dependencies each of the things on the page actually has well it's
[826.42 → 830.80] just easier because you can see like what inheritance you can see exactly which element it is, and you can
[830.80 → 836.10] like jump into this and that's okay that's band on my so i can go and find that super easily now and
[836.10 → 843.14] change things and do whatever i want that's just kind of fun it looks kind of cool that's really the
[843.14 → 848.56] main reason why it's awesome I'm not even going to try and hide that it just looks really cool it's like
[848.56 → 855.04] look i can do this it's really not like yeah i don't know it's not exactly needed why don't we do a
[855.04 → 859.14] little bit of twitter questions since apparently that was a big problem for us last time if we've
[859.14 → 864.80] been doing freaking twitter questions we would have known that the stream wasn't working at all
[864.80 → 872.50] uh, so someone says you're sexy I'm with Thomas on this one um what do you think about the rumours of
[872.50 → 877.26] NVIDIA not allowing non-reference boards for gk110 why does NVIDIA hate overclocks NVIDIA doesn't hate
[877.26 → 883.60] overclocks NVIDIA hates dead chips because people overdo it that's what NVIDIA hates which i don't like
[883.60 → 889.82] i don't like dead chips either that's not what i meant i don't like that they're stopping progress
[889.82 → 897.88] okay new GPUs are progress yeah but limiting people's overvoting capabilities is not progress
[897.88 → 901.58] in my opinion i want to have fun with my stuff i don't want to just buy it and be like
[901.58 → 906.66] yeah it's in my system how much fun is your stuff if NVIDIA knows that as the processes keep
[906.66 → 913.10] shrinking overvoting is going to be more okay remember a GPU is not like a CPU where you can
[913.10 → 920.20] do this to it, you can just be like oh yeah CPUs lots more leakage with the new smaller process so
[920.20 → 927.10] we'll just put this on it, and then it's okay GPUs you're limited to this stupid horrible
[927.10 → 933.50] inefficient cooling form factor where i mean putting a fan sideways on something who came up
[933.50 → 940.70] with this is the worst thing ever and guys i know that that's because this slot in type of
[940.70 → 945.18] form factor is not designed for video cards i know they didn't come up with this because they
[945.18 → 948.76] thought it was brilliant they came up with this because it was a means to an end they have to
[948.76 → 954.34] cool the cards somehow but i mean here this is kind of a funny thing is people think
[954.34 → 960.06] that graphics cards output like shed loads of heat because they run really hot
[960.06 → 966.24] they don't if you actually take a like if you take a cooling loop like in the swift tech suite
[966.24 → 973.46] where uh where Gabe from swift tech had a CPU what was it two GPUs i think so two GPUs
[973.46 → 977.80] did he do musically no, no that was a different build a different system yeah okay i think he had
[977.80 → 981.68] a CPU and two GPUs in the one at the end of the table yeah he had two crazy ones i just always get
[981.68 → 986.32] them mixed up so he had a CPU and two GPUs and the actual coolant temperatures were only like four
[986.32 → 991.72] degrees higher and that speaks to the efficiency of the h220 liquid cooler for one thing but it also
[991.72 → 997.46] speaks to the fact that even though GPUs run hot that is not the same thing as outputting a lot of
[997.46 → 1004.26] heat if you guys sort of understand like if you were able to put a cooler like this on a GTX 680 i
[1004.26 → 1009.62] guarantee it would run cooler than a 3570k, so part of the problem is the form factor that they're stuck in
[1009.62 → 1015.02] um where it's yeah they can't just throw more cooling at the problem so i understand their
[1015.02 → 1025.34] perspective there bam okay fine i mean i don't I don't want to see us stuck with reference boards
[1025.34 → 1031.64] which like if those rumours are true that's what we're getting to and while i would prefer
[1031.64 → 1037.14] uh an NVIDIA reference board to an AMD reference board from what I've seen in the past three generations
[1037.14 → 1044.66] i would still like to give guys like Asus the ability to release you know balling republic of
[1044.66 → 1052.40] gamers stuff and I'd like to see guys like MSI releasing lightning cards and uh i mean that yeah
[1052.40 → 1059.08] that that particular reference board is not my cup of tea the 670 reference board actually has more
[1059.08 → 1065.48] coil wine and just sort of is generally like really pathetic looking compared to the 680 one
[1065.48 → 1071.08] um yeah it does make more noise it's not going to be too stoked if they keep going in that direction
[1071.08 → 1079.50] but um yeah slick's hair explain now i got it cut that's horrible what hey slick are you into Linux i
[1079.50 → 1087.10] think he means Linus and yeah he's super into me, it's a typo I'm not perfect with it but i try
[1087.10 → 1093.42] and it's really cool, and it's fun and come closer what just the framing's weird okay I'm going to move
[1093.42 → 1100.24] over too I'm not i don't just want to be close i was like what um yeah Linux is really cool i just wish
[1100.24 → 1108.14] i was better with it uh obs stream software yeah I've heard of it i can turn down the mic um we can
[1108.14 → 1114.76] you know what i can just not yell much that should be fine uh shout out to the Linus tech tips for a
[1114.76 → 1120.36] mod team yay speaking of the forum we actually haven't had any downtime this week
[1120.36 → 1124.62] that i knew about
[1124.62 → 1132.40] when did we have downtime it just kind of flick it out a little bit i don't know if very many people
[1132.40 → 1141.60] actually noticed at all no big deal it came back it's okay, okay well the forum's been way more stable
[1141.60 → 1147.66] we've stopped rolling out every beta release of evil in five that sort of comes across our inboxes
[1147.66 → 1153.34] that wasn't why the forum went down i know, but it couldn't have it was probably stable you know what
[1153.34 → 1161.78] i uh talk about it but when the when the release that fixes the uh the pages comes out
[1161.78 → 1164.94] we're going to go pretty hard for that one we're going to test that one in development, and then we're
[1164.94 → 1168.50] gonna hopefully release that one most of the other ones we're kind of ignoring because a lot of the
[1168.50 → 1176.22] fixes while they would help are not that substantial and bringing down the forum to put it live and then
[1176.22 → 1179.68] running into problems while we're trying to update because everyone runs into problems while they're
[1179.68 → 1183.22] trying to update Bolton 5 right now and then finally getting it live and then running
[1183.22 → 1188.06] into x y and z errors that we haven't seen before and all these people freaking out because
[1188.06 → 1193.68] yeah something doesn't work like that's not really worth it right now where we feel that most of our
[1193.68 → 1198.64] users on the forum are at least getting used to the bugs that are happening yeah people are finding
[1198.64 → 1202.84] their own kind of workarounds, and we posted a workaround for one and like it's becoming
[1202.84 → 1209.76] there we go that's more like it doesn't matter don't worry about it oh my goodness I'm still taller
[1209.76 → 1210.30] than you
[1210.30 → 1217.72] there you're sitting up all straight i can sit up straight too I'll just move closer to the camera
[1217.72 → 1222.28] there we go this is how they filmed the hobbit apparently they just had a bunch of people
[1222.28 → 1226.34] standing closer to the camera see we could make me look like a giant and slick look like a midget
[1226.34 → 1231.10] that's kind of lighting's all weird on your face though they can tell, and they also can tell that
[1231.10 → 1235.38] you just put my chair all the way to the bottom and the bottom of my chair the top of the like
[1235.38 → 1240.28] seat part of my chair they can't see that is at the bottom of his that's that's the smoke and
[1240.28 → 1245.36] mirrors that is that much further down than he is uh what were you what were you talking about
[1245.36 → 1248.04] sorry something about how the forum went down, and it's all your fault
[1248.04 → 1254.82] you're fired uh mods have been great thanks literally everyone on the mod team that's been
[1254.82 → 1259.92] awesome we might actually have some cool new stuff to talk to the mod team about yeah at some point
[1259.92 → 1264.20] we're not going to talk about that now though top secret for now but that could be really fun
[1264.20 → 1270.74] yeah that could be like actually kind of the best thing ever that was a good idea at first i didn't
[1270.74 → 1274.94] think it was a great idea everyone's just wondering what the heck we're talking about now um everyone by
[1274.94 → 1279.30] the way if you see stuff like that's in the wrong forum if you see stuff that's bad there is the flag
[1279.30 → 1283.20] tool at the bottom of the post that works right that is one of the things that works yes right now
[1283.20 → 1288.40] unfortunately there's only two people that see it only the admins can see the flags so not the
[1288.40 → 1293.10] whole mod team gets to see the flags so it will possibly take us a bit because we're working on other
[1293.10 → 1298.72] stuff whatnot but i will, I do get to all the flags that get posted so if you post a flag i will get to
[1298.72 → 1308.90] it uh just found out my WD green external can copy uh okay where the heck is the thing oh, oh yeah
[1308.90 → 1314.16] usb2 that's that's about the max it can do is 35 megabytes per second so I'm pretty sure that's what
[1314.16 → 1318.10] you meant uh what's the difference between sass and SATA that's one of those if you don't know you
[1318.10 → 1322.90] don't really need to know kinds of things sass has some more enterprise level error correction built
[1322.90 → 1327.86] into it um it plays nicely more nicely with things like backplates that'll split it out
[1327.86 → 1335.06] yeah, yeah like SATA supports simple port multipliers but some of the more advanced functionality is um
[1335.06 → 1342.46] yeah sass actually yeah i thought it's sass um he's got some nice sass splitters so we'll get one
[1342.46 → 1346.92] of those that'll show one of the things that you can actually do with it which is actually really cool
[1346.92 → 1353.16] yeah sass is uh sass supports not only sort of splitting out to individual what appear to be
[1353.16 → 1359.74] SATA connectors uh from something like a SFF 8087 which is what this connector is, but it also supports
[1359.74 → 1367.28] direct 8087 connections to like an 8087 compatible backplate and things like that so sass is uh is more
[1367.28 → 1372.18] server professional enterprise level technology whereas SATA is more for consumer level
[1372.18 → 1376.92] um they're not actually any difference in terms of the speed so don't worry about it
[1376.92 → 1383.86] uh is WD ever going to enter the SSD market um i would expect them well they already have
[1383.86 → 1388.90] like two years ago or whenever it was when they released um i don't remember what it was called
[1388.90 → 1396.52] it wasn't very successful weren't they aren't there oh hold on um that whole uh presentation that we
[1396.52 → 1401.12] attended was not talking about that oh okay go ahead uh weren't there like a ton of rumours that they
[1401.12 → 1406.64] were going to acquire Oct there for a while or was that Seagate no that was Seagate oh okay yeah
[1406.64 → 1410.72] because like is it Seagate that's actually like thinking about getting into the SSD game
[1410.72 → 1416.56] um Seagate i had a call with them, but my entire call is under NDA so i can't actually talk about
[1416.56 → 1420.80] this topic, but he doesn't know so he can talk about it as much as he wants, but he doesn't know
[1420.80 → 1425.56] so there's nothing to say yeah yes there were tons of rumours when Oct was kind of in the dumpster
[1425.56 → 1428.78] for a bit that Seagate was going to acquire them Ted says nice beaver haircut
[1428.78 → 1433.26] you're i don't even know what my hair looks no beaver has hair like that now like this you
[1433.26 → 1438.06] basically look like Justin beaver that's unfortunate too bad you don't sound like he's like half my size
[1438.06 → 1445.10] and sounds like a girl he's so dreamy oh no you disgust me trade-offs between multi and single rail
[1445.10 → 1450.54] power supplies i think we've covered this before so I'm going to leave that one um okay, okay okay we're
[1450.54 → 1455.98] risking it we're risking it oh yeah that i do look dodgy, and you do look like you're thinking really hard
[1455.98 → 1462.06] about something thinking long and hard you know what was really creepy i showed Linus's the face
[1462.06 → 1471.42] swap post on the forum oh that is oh god that is just awful here I'm going to go find it oh tech just
[1471.42 → 1481.10] unsettling just face swap it's just weird okay so yeah here it is guys this is the Linus and slick
[1481.10 → 1489.26] face swap thread yeah yeah I'm working out, so this is just like i don't know why it's so creepy but
[1489.26 → 1494.62] it really is seeming really slow right now yeah i know why is the forum so slow slick way to go
[1494.62 → 1499.02] you can give me actual hosting maybe you could be not running me on beta software
[1500.14 → 1505.02] uh maybe give me an actual server you know what that server's not bad yeah that's true
[1505.02 → 1512.14] that's like it's a 980x it's not a bad server by any stretch of the imagination it has like baller 40
[1512.14 → 1520.70] 48 gigs of ram yeah what 48 gigs of none ram but speaking of things that are optimized for
[1520.70 → 1527.34] server and professional applications and not that not optimal for not the like what are they
[1527.34 → 1533.74] they're rip jaws right uh yeah they're skill rip jaws okay so the forum's just apparently not working at
[1533.74 → 1538.06] all nope no wait there go oh no wait yes wait slow
[1541.18 → 1544.30] is everyone hammering the forum because we're talking about it in the live stream
[1545.58 → 1550.70] oh god is it just down yeah weren't we just talking about how it's not down yeah
[1554.06 → 1556.70] is it down or timing out it's
[1556.70 → 1562.38] uh check the twitch chat is anyone on the forum
[1564.38 → 1568.78] like was it up recently a lot of people are saying it's down was it up recently guys
[1570.22 → 1577.74] ah you've got to be kidding me well that's depressing okay well i guess you guys will have to just trust me
[1577.74 → 1585.26] when i say that it's creepy and uh you'll have to sort of look into that so i guess we'll move right
[1585.26 → 1592.14] along in terms of our discussion topics ah yes my personal rig is finally going to be having some
[1592.14 → 1597.74] progress made on it so i got a confirmation from mountain mods that i am going to be getting my case
[1597.74 → 1603.26] back next week so i sent it down there for powder coating it actually was a little bit trickier to do
[1603.26 → 1609.66] the powder coating than they initially thought so they had to um okay the first time i sent my tj07 to
[1609.66 → 1617.42] them i had the anodization left on the side panels and on the unibody frame because it was beautiful it
[1617.42 → 1622.70] was immaculate it was brand new so i only sent them the internals to powder coat with their black wrinkle
[1622.70 → 1627.26] however this time around because I've had my case for a long time now, and it's gotten kind of beat
[1627.26 → 1633.90] up and scuffed and scratched, and these side panels have that that hairline brushed aluminum finish that
[1633.90 → 1640.62] i love but is extremely susceptible to staining like if you just touch it, and you don't wipe it off
[1640.62 → 1644.94] immediately then it'll just leave a stain of a fingerprint that etches itself into the aluminum and
[1644.94 → 1649.74] you can't get rid of afterwards so i had that all over it so i was like okay screw it I'm just going to
[1649.74 → 1655.42] powder coat the whole thing this time so i sent them the entire case and I'm actually uh what's going
[1655.42 → 1663.82] on okay slick just like barrelled out of here so uh i have no idea what's going on but whatever it is
[1663.82 → 1669.50] it's sort of a big deal apparently so anyway my case um was stained to crap so i sent them the whole
[1669.50 → 1674.70] thing I'm actually replacing so not only the finish on the entire thing it's going to be black wrinkle
[1674.70 → 1679.66] um but I'm also replacing the side panel window so instead of using a piece of acrylic which is just
[1679.66 → 1685.50] horrible like acrylic scratches by the time you actually peel the plastic cover off of it
[1685.50 → 1690.46] most of the time and because it's such a static magnet it's always got dust on it and it always
[1690.46 → 1695.42] kind of looks cloudy no matter what you try to do so I'm replacing that with glass as well
[1695.42 → 1700.14] but anyway, so mountain mods found it was kind of tricky because they had to strip off the anodization
[1700.14 → 1707.26] and then the logos on the on that case are actually done with a special epoxy like it's an opaque epoxy
[1707.26 → 1711.02] there's a Silverstone logo at the top and then there's like a power indicator at the bottom so
[1711.02 → 1714.94] they had to get that stripped off as well they had to i think they ended up sanding it off just to get
[1714.94 → 1719.58] rid of it um there's a special remover for it and i know that it's kind of out there in the forums but
[1719.58 → 1724.06] they're just painting the thing anyway so they just scratched it then they had to actually paint it
[1724.06 → 1729.34] and then once it gets back I'm going to find out if i can even put the thing together because i remember
[1729.34 → 1735.66] having a conversation with uh Charles from murder mod back this must have been like four years ago four or five
[1735.66 → 1741.02] years ago wow I've been doing this a long time anyway i had a conversation with Charles from murder mod
[1741.02 → 1746.94] back when he first started up where he said that the issue with powder coating tj07s is that the um
[1746.94 → 1752.46] the tolerances can sometimes be so tight on the side panels that once you add that extra bit of thickness
[1752.46 → 1759.10] to the unibody in the side panel you actually can't mount the thing on anymore so I'm uh I'm a little bit
[1759.10 → 1767.50] worried that that's what's going to happen to mine but if it do, i have a tj11 sort of on standby and
[1767.50 → 1774.14] I'll go ahead and just kind of use that and i won't be too sad about it um speaking of my
[1774.14 → 1781.26] personal rig actually this is really cool i wanted to show you guys this uh we did an unboxing of this
[1781.26 → 1786.86] reservoir earlier this week, so this will be coming soon but if you guys remember I'm using one of the
[1786.86 → 1795.18] limited edition swift tech apogee HD gold-plated blocks they only made 200 um so NCI ordered i think
[1795.18 → 1805.50] NCI placed the second order so NCI got numbers uh 60 to 120 or something like that or like 60 60 to 100
[1805.50 → 1816.54] or i don't know yeah 60 to 120 so i got number 69 and um i wanted to do kind of like a gold themed build so
[1816.54 → 1825.26] i saw this and it kind of caught my eye it is a gold-plated uh cylinder reservoir from uh phobia
[1825.82 → 1830.94] phobia so it's actually got gold-plated plugs that come with it so i was thinking with bits power
[1830.94 → 1838.14] gold-plated compressions this thing would look absolutely amazing but um i just I'm not sure
[1838.14 → 1843.82] is it something like this it is actually like it's heavy too, so the end caps are brass unlike on the t-virus
[1843.82 → 1850.38] reservoir where they're made of uh acetyl or Berlin or um yeah acetyl and Berlin are the most common
[1850.38 → 1855.42] names for it so it actually has some heft to it which i kind of like comes with really, really nice
[1855.42 → 1863.34] mounts so most of these cylinder rises come with sort of cheesy Lexi mounts is it up its like bogged to
[1863.34 → 1870.54] all hell what's wrong with it, i think it might be running a timed backup because they run on hour-based
[1870.54 → 1876.46] cycles not like this time every day because we wanted to have more backups because of last time
[1876.46 → 1881.10] that we lost posts so i think we hit a terrible time because we started talking about stuff in the
[1881.10 → 1886.06] forum and so everyone hit it so it's backing up the database and people are hitting the database
[1886.06 → 1892.14] so it's just like so if the database ran on like SSD then would it just well one of the things that
[1892.14 → 1897.98] we're thinking about doing is making a dedicated my sequel computer right okay this would kind of
[1897.98 → 1902.70] help with that kind of stuff okay yeah because see I've just been killing time here i started talking
[1902.70 → 1909.50] about a reservoir i had nothing i was like i was like whatever he's doing it looks really urgent
[1909.50 → 1914.78] well i started pinging uh i'm pinning i pinged other boxes i thought maybe i thought maybe the Chinese
[1914.78 → 1920.14] guy was back, or something oh god did we ever talk about that i don't think so we got attacked by a
[1920.14 → 1926.54] Chinese guy a Chinese hacker yeah he's a ninja that was nuts and then the well you haven't even talked
[1926.54 → 1931.50] about why it's nuts because anyone can sort of be a script kitty, but this guy was like serious business
[1931.50 → 1936.62] guys knew what he was talking about what happened uh we just got absolutely hammered like harder than
[1937.58 → 1943.02] we've like we've had a few different DDoS attacks before we got the nice firewall and then this guy just
[1943.02 → 1948.06] crushed us like it was ridiculous, and we weren't really getting touched by him at all like the site was
[1948.06 → 1953.26] going fine it was just like in other cases it kind of like sped up i think people were using uh like
[1953.26 → 1959.34] look and stuff which doesn't seem to all hit all at once but this guy was like prepared and angry i
[1959.34 → 1965.18] mean what kind of gear do you figure he had a lot i don't know exactly what he had but a lot so how far
[1965.18 → 1972.46] did he get he was ashing into our Linux box which means he was trying he was like getting
[1972.46 → 1978.22] yeah trying to remote connecting to our box which is like not cool and what's the point there's no
[1978.22 → 1984.30] data on it that's like helpful yeah i guess anyway the point is we have a baller firewall now yeah and
[1984.30 → 1991.34] he's tried again since then and failed and the firewall basically gave him the old nope no, thank you
[1991.34 → 1998.94] please sir thank you bye so uh see you later alligator that was cool actually yeah that's kind of neat
[1999.50 → 2006.70] um so where were we ah yes okay i wanted to do a model numbers rant um that's not really related
[2006.70 → 2012.94] to anything so bring up those SSDs again uh okay I'm going to go get another SSD that's somewhat related
[2012.94 → 2022.14] to this round why am I bringing these up particularly okay here's another one okay so product naming
[2022.14 → 2032.86] consistency this drives me crazy this is a Samsung 830 this is a top of the range performance drive
[2032.86 → 2039.90] that is as good as it gets from its generation i know where you're going with this is a Samsung 840
[2039.90 → 2050.86] this is a mainstream drive okay this is a Samsung 840 pro this is a top of the range performance drive
[2050.86 → 2063.02] why isn't an 840 a continuation of an 830 why isn't this called the 740 i mean that's okay here this is
[2063.02 → 2068.14] this is what makes me crazy, and it's not just them the graphics cards guys do it everyone does it if you
[2068.14 → 2075.66] have a number based naming scheme scale as you go to the right why not just change the number and make
[2075.66 → 2081.90] it is different like okay out of all the numbers out of all the numbers between zero and a thousand Samsung
[2081.90 → 2088.54] has used a grand total of i think four of them why not just call it an 840 and an 835
[2088.54 → 2098.22] or like a 720 or i mean they can't use 520 because intel used that yeah and then there's intel's
[2098.22 → 2105.58] numbers which are just random just two cares like the five it's a 520 it's a 330 and then a 335 i think
[2105.58 → 2112.94] it's just a 330 with like a die shrink or something like that and isn't faster yeah like at all and
[2112.94 → 2118.70] actually you know what no NVIDIA has been sometimes perfect and sometimes super inconsistent like
[2118.70 → 2123.74] i don't know if you remember when they pulled okay this wasn't as bad as what they skipped 300
[2123.74 → 2129.98] yes which just like still blows people's minds skip 300 outright like i always i actually make mistakes
[2129.98 → 2136.38] when I'm talking about how many generations apart graphics cards what happened there they skipped
[2136.38 → 2143.10] they completely skipped 300 and then 200 to 400 was a huge generational leap that could have I mean
[2143.10 → 2147.02] do you think they had a product and then just didn't release it but then why wouldn't you just
[2147.74 → 2153.58] name the new one 300 and like okay and what's up with NVIDIA and sometimes releasing a flagship product
[2153.58 → 2159.42] that is an ultra and sometimes releasing a flagship project that is uh that one five
[2160.30 → 2165.74] then like what happened to all the differentiation between GTX and GTS and GT what happened to gx2
[2165.74 → 2172.38] yeah now that's just a 90 yeah right so they just floated all around they're just and although i
[2172.38 → 2179.66] think AMD was probably the worst one when they went from a 6970 being a top of the range single GPU
[2180.22 → 2190.46] to a 6990 being a dual card to a set no wait which one 5870 right 5970 was a dual GPU card
[2190.46 → 2197.18] right 6970 was a top of the range single GPU i actually never really even thought about that
[2197.18 → 2205.50] and then it was a 6990 it's like, so there's a 20 digit like 20 number separation between a 6970 and a
[2205.50 → 2217.90] 6990 when a 6990 is actually two 6970s before that it was 5850 5870 same kind of thing, and then it was an um
[2217.90 → 2228.38] 5850 was it hold on 5970 wasn't it oh crap now i don't remember Microsoft's terrible for it too
[2228.38 → 2232.30] operating systems I'm just confused see, but this is the kind of confusion that comes around
[2233.42 → 2240.62] operating systems go back and forth in between letters and XP and years and then digits, and it's
[2240.62 → 2247.42] like what instead of having two digits we're going to have one digit yeah, and you go from like years
[2247.42 → 2254.62] to like random small letter combinations to vista which is a word and then yeah number it's like nope
[2255.74 → 2260.30] back down to single number it's like what are you doing like why can't they just make it simple
[2260.30 → 2268.70] for the consumer it's like this is the know botanist thing you know 250 and that's better than the
[2268.70 → 2274.54] botanist thing 200. I don't know even though I don't like them apple does pretty okay they just
[2274.54 → 2282.94] don't care no iPad no, no iPad you know it kind of drives me crazy because I was listening to the
[2282.94 → 2288.94] radio, and they were doing a giveaway for um for an iPad with retina display and I was like which one
[2290.94 → 2296.14] which iPad with retina display that's fantastic I love how they just don't care like nope it doesn't
[2296.14 → 2301.02] have a name and like the worst thing about iPad 3 versus iPad 4 is that the differentiation between
[2301.02 → 2308.70] these two products is so small and so insignificant that like and like the general consumer so
[2308.70 → 2316.38] doesn't care about an a6 or an a8 or an a25 or whatever chip happens to be in it that it's just like
[2316.38 → 2324.06] they're like iPad with retina like it used to be that you could go ipad 2 okay iPad with retina
[2324.06 → 2331.26] now it's like iPad with retina like there 's's no killer feature where you can go yeah
[2331.26 → 2337.18] this is like the one and then but on iPhone they number them except when they put an s on it so
[2337.18 → 2342.62] anyway naming schemes if anyone out there is listening everyone who comes up with naming schemes that make
[2342.62 → 2352.06] no sense is uh is just like needs to not do that any more um speaking of naming schemes that make no
[2352.06 → 2357.18] sense in windows operating systems uh Windows phone 8 actually that makes perfect sense total yeah I know
[2358.38 → 2366.14] don't worry about it so I now have not only the HTC 8x but I've also got my hands on a 8s and i just
[2366.14 → 2371.58] want to say for those of you who have been enjoying my I switched series of videos where I'm logging my
[2371.58 → 2377.82] impressions not necessarily as a total expert because people have been like hardcore criticizing
[2377.82 → 2381.82] the videos going he doesn't know what he's doing yeah that's the point I don't know what I'm doing
[2381.82 → 2389.18] I'm not a phone guy I'm giving you my experience I personally did not find it intuitive to go into my
[2389.18 → 2396.70] contact list like this and okay I find scrolling intuitive I find scrolling on the right-hand side
[2396.70 → 2402.54] like it's done in iOS and android intuitive I do not find it intuitive to click this number sign here
[2402.54 → 2408.94] and have that bring up a menu of numbers that I can or letters that I can skip to I haven't seen this
[2408.94 → 2413.82] yeah this is a button how was I supposed to know that right I asked you what that was I was like you
[2413.82 → 2418.86] have a contact that doesn't have a name well yeah, but it's just their headers so you can click
[2418.86 → 2423.10] i know but i when we first started looking at your phone I was like why do you have a contact
[2423.10 → 2427.26] that doesn't have a name right so anyway I didn't figure that out it's so another thing that I didn't
[2427.26 → 2431.82] and to me that okay yes you could go Linus you didn't do enough research on the phone I go well
[2431.82 → 2437.10] yeah but who does yeah if I'm approaching it as not a phone enthusiast as just a general consumer
[2437.10 → 2441.26] the other one was I complained that notifications that come down from the top don't go away you can't
[2441.26 → 2447.34] just click out of them and so for me as a Windows user if something pops up my first reaction
[2447.34 → 2451.42] is just click somewhere else, and it'll go away, and it doesn't work that way because what you're
[2451.42 → 2457.34] supposed to do is swipe them away to the right that to me was not a natural windows response if
[2457.34 → 2463.26] you're an android user that makes sense but I'm an iOS user didn't know that, so anyway the point is
[2463.26 → 2469.42] most of the issues that I had have been resolved in a big way and the 8s fixes my last problem with the
[2469.42 → 2476.14] Windows 8 platform because it is significantly smaller so the issue I have with the 8x is that I can't
[2476.14 → 2481.98] really I can't really it's a little bit more slippery than the 8s and I can't quite reach the far left
[2481.98 → 2488.86] side while holding on to the phone so the 8s is a four-inch screen versus a 4.3-inch screen so you can
[2488.86 → 2493.10] see it's quite a bit smaller and is much more comfortable it also has a soft touch grip to the
[2493.10 → 2498.30] back and I can reach all the way across of it across it so typing is much easier the one issue I have
[2498.30 → 2504.14] with the 8s is that it's only a four gig phone so I'm going to see if all of my apps fit on the 8s
[2504.14 → 2507.98] and then I might actually switch to if it's expandable, but you can't install apps on the SD
[2507.98 → 2513.42] card oh yeah it has a micro SD whereas the 8x doesn't have a micro SD expansion slot, so there's
[2513.42 → 2518.30] sort of give and takes to both of them and for those of you who are asking why I didn't get a Lucia 920
[2518.30 → 2524.30] it's because I don't have a Lucia 920. HTC sent me these Windows phones in order to do my impressions
[2524.30 → 2528.86] so that I could so that I could make these videos and I mean they knew that it wasn't necessarily going
[2528.86 → 2535.18] to be all roses about the phones because I'd never used Windows phone uh 8 before and self-admittedly
[2535.18 → 2539.58] self-admittedly not a phone guy I even told them I'm like I'm not a phone guy why do you even want
[2539.58 → 2543.66] me to do this that's part of the reason why they're like it's because you're not a phone guy we want to
[2543.66 → 2548.70] find out from a non-phone guy how this whole experience goes and so uh so yeah I thought that
[2548.70 → 2553.74] was pretty cool and I think as I get closer to the end of the 30 days I'm going to be a lot more comfortable
[2553.74 → 2557.50] with it tell them what you said today uh what did I say today when we were walking downstairs and you
[2557.50 → 2562.46] were like I think I might actually I may actually switch yeah so I'm getting to the point where I'm
[2562.46 → 2567.34] I may actually I may actually stick with Windows phone and I'm not going android this comes from
[2567.34 → 2574.70] like a pretty hardcore apple phone guy yeah I pretty I like the iOS a lot yeah yeah I always is good
[2574.70 → 2579.82] I still like iOS, but you know what's funny is when I pick up my iPhone 4 it feels like a brick now
[2579.82 → 2586.70] because the 8x is so much bigger and so much lighter and just like it's sexier and just kind
[2586.70 → 2592.14] of better in uh in every way but yeah I'm not going android I know there are a lot of features that
[2592.14 → 2598.30] android has but I don't like the user experience sorry part of that could be I've said this before but
[2598.30 → 2603.18] part of it could be because I'm more used to android on tablet that's where I've used it mostly and I've
[2603.18 → 2609.74] spent a fair bit of time on android in a tablet environment but i I just don't want that for my phone
[2609.82 → 2614.06] for my phone experience we all know it's totally different, but he's just he's just a hater you
[2614.06 → 2621.50] know what entire conversation is missing now we didn't talk about the Logan thing oh my god I know
[2621.50 → 2628.14] we talked about this for like 10 minutes so Logan made a pretty bold claim uh Logan from tech syndicate
[2628.14 → 2633.42] if you're not subscribed to tech syndicate make sure you are uh it's uh YouTube.com slash raise the world
[2633.42 → 2641.58] where the o in world is a zero um so he made a pretty bold claim that the 80 FX 8350 uh pile driver
[2641.58 → 2649.18] core AMD processor is just as good if not better for gaming in a lot of cases than the 3570k and the
[2649.18 → 2654.70] conventional wisdom on the Internets has been if you're gaming get a 3570k shot up about it and just
[2654.70 → 2660.62] go enjoy your processor so when you guys brought it up on the live stream last week I had initially kind
[2660.62 → 2665.58] of went ah poo, poo no it's not right and that wasn't because I was just being dismissive of someone
[2665.58 → 2672.54] else's results we have tested those chips before um the last time we did a head-to-head was with the 2500k
[2672.54 → 2680.14] and the 8150 but both of those are about 10 slower than the processors that replaced them the 3570 and the
[2680.14 → 2688.46] 8350, and we did not have his experience between those two chips at all and like we didn't run the same
[2688.46 → 2692.14] benchmarks that's true we didn't run the same benchmark the only one that we ran that was the
[2692.14 → 2698.70] same was crisis, and we had a very similar output okay so that could be part of it another part of
[2698.70 → 2705.34] it is that it came to my attention that Logan was using a released and then retracted Windows 7 patch
[2705.34 → 2712.38] that looks like it optimizes the scheduling of uh processes across multiple cores better which would
[2712.38 → 2718.78] obviously be an advantage for the 8350 versus the 3570k which not only has half as many cores well
[2718.78 → 2724.46] sort of half as many cores bulldozer modules are not quite too coarse they're like one and a half course
[2724.46 → 2729.74] so it has fewer cores, and it doesn't even have the benefit of hyper threading like the 3770k does but
[2729.74 → 2734.38] the 3770k is in a different price bracket from an 8350 so we can't make that comparison
[2735.02 → 2741.98] so we kind of went okay let's take all this and let's put a Linus tech tips spin on it so we're not going to
[2741.98 → 2748.22] quite run the exact same thing as him the exact same way we like I sat down and watched all those
[2748.22 → 2753.82] videos and took immense immense immense amounts of notes I have like four or five pages worth of notes
[2753.82 → 2757.82] we paid attention, and we're going to try and do our own thing not copy but do our own thing so we're
[2757.82 → 2760.94] going to do our own thing, and we're going to take a slightly different angle so number one our test
[2760.94 → 2766.22] platforms we're going to keep them as similar as possible we're going to run a 660 ti power edition
[2766.22 → 2771.82] we are going to run what did we decide on the amount of ram what eight gigs oh what ram are we running
[2771.82 → 2779.82] oh okay we're running 16 gigs of uh of ddr3 1600 cl mine ram so just like normal memory we're running
[2779.82 → 2786.86] a crosshair 5 formulae and a Maximus 5 formulae so the most up-to-date highest performance rogue boards for
[2786.86 → 2792.14] each of those platforms okay I guess there's technically a Maximus 5 extreme but yeah but like
[2792.14 → 2797.82] pretty bleeding edge both formula level boards um, and we're going to stick with 1080p because that's
[2797.82 → 2802.94] sort of our tradition most people still aren't really running 1440p particularly gamers if you're
[2802.94 → 2808.14] buying fast TM panels or whatever else um those aren't really out there in 1440. I'm not trying to
[2808.14 → 2813.34] be rude I'm talking to Mr wizard about bringing the forum up and stuff is it still down it's its kind
[2813.34 → 2821.18] of shaky okay so we're I'm I'm not trying to be rude keep going no
[2821.18 → 2829.58] uh where was I right we're going to stick with 1080p one video card we're going to run a variety of
[2829.58 → 2835.18] games and our benchmarking settings for those games will be very similar to tests we've done on
[2835.18 → 2839.82] those games previously we're keeping our kind of style we're going to do our style so I think one of
[2839.82 → 2845.02] the thing slogan did was he maxed he cranked all the settings because he was looking at it from a well
[2845.02 → 2851.02] okay if you've got all the processing power whether it's an 8350 or 3570k we can all agree that they're both
[2851.02 → 2855.82] beast that's fine if you have a high-end video card you're probably going to crank up your settings
[2855.82 → 2860.70] however something that we've observed in the past is that if you crank the settings completely to the max
[2860.70 → 2867.02] some games just break so we've seen games where performance just falls off a cliff disproportionately
[2867.02 → 2872.70] I've seen games where turning on antialiasing past a certain point increases the input lag of the
[2872.70 → 2877.26] game engine itself to the point where it's just totally unplayable so we're going to go for that
[2877.26 → 2883.42] that sort of that realistic yeah we'd actually play like this so if they is one wins over the
[2883.42 → 2888.54] other it's probably going to be the difference between 45 fps and 38 fps so we're going for that
[2888.54 → 2894.22] that playable range rather than just kind of tanking it as hard as we can and seeing what happens
[2894.22 → 2899.34] we are also going to shake up one thing that Logan didn't do, and we're going to change the OS up
[2899.34 → 2904.54] so we're going to do Windows 7 without the patch that you have to get by specifically requesting it
[2904.54 → 2909.34] because it was retracted we're going to do it with the patch on Windows 7, and then we're going to do
[2909.34 → 2915.90] Windows 8 because Windows 8 should have that that logic already built into it so, and we've been
[2915.90 → 2921.26] being I mean people have asked us how many times to do gaming on Windows 7 performance versus gaming on
[2921.26 → 2926.86] Windows 8 performance with the same platform so in this case we're going to do that on intel and on AMD
[2926.86 → 2932.62] separately to say sort of once and for all does the OS impact the gaming performance I can tell you guys
[2932.62 → 2936.94] right now it doesn't very much, but we're going to do a video about it anyway we're going to prove it
[2937.98 → 2941.98] there are some areas where it's better or worse I've seen some other people's benchmarks not a lot
[2941.98 → 2946.38] you're not huge no it's not huge, but it's the kind of thing you'd never notice unless you're testing
[2946.38 → 2952.22] side by side still interesting though okay interesting yes so I'll give it that it is interesting and i
[2952.22 → 2955.98] think you closed up the notebook which is where I had my notes for what I wanted to talk about
[2955.98 → 2962.70] um okay is the forum up enough that we can show them the scary creepy thread now uh it's its kind
[2962.70 → 2967.26] of fluttering in and out we can try let's see if that one thread manages to load so
[2969.66 → 2975.50] everybody cross your fingers is the forum gonna load, and you know of course every time we talk about
[2975.50 → 2979.74] it they're all gonna let's just let it sit okay here I have to go to the washroom so why don't you
[2979.74 → 2989.58] preview this surprise you have for me show them what it is okay, okay oh so oh it's not loading at
[2989.58 → 2995.18] all is it no it just totally failed okay so I can't really show it too much because I don't want to take
[2995.18 → 3001.18] it out of the box I ordered some stuff from China some keyboard stuff um I got a ducky wrist rest
[3003.26 → 3007.26] it's all leather and I'm not really usually a fan of wrist rest because I don't really like the really
[3007.26 → 3014.30] jelly stuff but this one's very kind of hard but then still comfortable so pretty stoked about that
[3014.30 → 3018.30] I do not like wrist rest but I've been using this over the last little while and this is the only one
[3018.30 → 3022.22] I've had that i actually really like but I've never had a really solid wrist rest before so
[3023.10 → 3028.54] not hitting on any other wrist rest and then I'm a fan of keyboards and I wanted to get another one
[3028.54 → 3034.78] and I was going to buy a filch magic touch the uh you can find out it's on CX if it's a special
[3034.78 → 3039.74] edition one, but it has yellow keycaps um and then I decided that I wanted to get a 10 keyless one and
[3039.74 → 3043.58] I was looking around at different keyboards and decided that I might as well get a year of the
[3043.58 → 3048.70] dragon one from ducky let me see right there I'm not going to open it because I'm going to get him to do
[3048.70 → 3056.06] it um so that's pretty cool i kind of wanted to get a year of the dragon one because uh they make year
[3056.06 → 3063.10] of the keyboards kind of fairly consistently um, and they're always pretty cool and like this one's got a
[3063.10 → 3066.30] lot of cool features, and it looks really cool, and they do their own little thing with if it's pretty
[3066.30 → 3071.82] awesome holy crap I bought I brought some of the cool stuff that we're going to be checking out soon
[3071.82 → 3078.70] on the channel so uh all of this arrived today which is kind of sweet so we have a razor orb weaver on
[3078.70 → 3086.14] hand we saw this at CES tell me slick okay as someone who hasn't typically found I mean have you ever
[3086.14 → 3091.58] owned a razor peripheral that you've used for an extended period of time technically yes one okay, okay
[3091.58 → 3097.90] but in general not really much of a razor guy tell me about this and my one razor thing i kind of
[3097.90 → 3104.94] hate it okay, and it's broken to tell me about this um I hate these things not like this one in particular
[3104.94 → 3110.86] but like these little game pads game pad things I've never really okay seen the intrigue about it
[3110.86 → 3115.66] but if I had to get one this one just crushes all the other ones it comes with uh that's important the
[3115.66 → 3126.78] word crush like no competition oh um cherry MX blue key switches all fully mechanical game pad
[3126.78 → 3132.86] which i I mean makes it how much better than everything else just crushes like it's not even
[3132.86 → 3138.30] funny and like I still am not a fan of the platform I don't like the idea I want my full keyboard but
[3138.30 → 3143.58] if is that is the solution that you want that one is the one you should get I'm I'm like so excited about
[3143.58 → 3148.06] this I mean we only got we didn't even get to play a game with it at CES because it was just
[3148.06 → 3151.98] like on here if you want to hold it up that's probably helpful uh because it was just like
[3152.94 → 3159.02] now I can't see it okay well whatever this thing um so we didn't get to play any games because they
[3159.02 → 3165.82] just had it on demo like not actually running any games so what could we do but um we i I got to be
[3165.82 → 3172.06] hands-on with it what was neat about it was it's adjustable enough like some things like I would go as far
[3172.06 → 3177.18] as to say the rat is a little bit over adjustable to the point where no one actually needs to do that
[3177.74 → 3182.86] well whatever I still think it's cool okay fine if no it's cool agree it's cool I don't want one
[3182.86 → 3187.66] personally but I still think it's cool okay, but this is adjustable enough to the point where I can put
[3187.66 → 3193.90] my hands on it, and it works slick put his hands on it, and it still works its still usable no matter
[3193.90 → 3198.38] no matter how you're using if it's fully programmable which is a requirement for something like this
[3198.38 → 3202.54] and it actually has a lot of keys I mean you can complain all you want about how you want your
[3202.54 → 3208.06] full keyboard, but this thing has 20 keys you have huge hands though like I can't reach more
[3208.06 → 3213.50] than this many keys for sure like the size of this thing I can't get any further over than that in all
[3213.50 → 3219.34] likelihood and the d-pad is another big deal as well so I am super excited to check this out and synapse
[3219.34 → 3225.98] has been fixed now to the point where it works offline so yeah that was done pretty quick I hated on that
[3225.98 → 3230.94] pretty hard, but they fixed that pretty quick so I don't know okay so we've got an acer notebook that
[3230.94 → 3238.78] just arrived uh, so this is an Aspire m touch which I hope is uh something that we can talk about
[3240.94 → 3245.10] okay if is it's not then hopefully no one from acer is watching because I don't want to get in trouble
[3245.10 → 3252.86] and then this one is oh this I'm really excited about this is an Aspire s7 13 inch so I've checked
[3252.86 → 3258.30] out the 11 inch before that's the one with the aluminum top that's got like a crosshatch uh brushed
[3258.30 → 3263.90] aluminum pattern on it and is super light this one's a little bit heavier it's a 13 inch but what's
[3263.90 → 3271.58] special about this guy is the fact that it has um a gorilla glass top and looks just absolutely beautiful
[3271.58 → 3279.34] like the acer of sort of you know thin plastic shells and screens that flex like this seems to have just
[3279.34 → 3285.66] been sort of dropped a hole and buried with uh with a notebook like this so I'm really
[3285.66 → 3291.42] excited to check it out I have not been hands-on with the Aspire s7 13 inch yet oh I know what these
[3291.42 → 3295.58] are and this I have a pretty good idea of what it is, but we actually haven't opened it, yet this is from
[3295.58 → 3304.46] corsair so lets uh go ahead and pull out the old knife but I'm hoping that this is corsair's uh this is
[3304.46 → 3313.10] corsair shot across the bow of next because next actually beat them to market on a 140 millimetre and
[3313.10 → 3324.86] 280 millimetre liquid cooler, and it is this is the corsair h110 which is a large and I mean large liquid
[3324.86 → 3331.90] cooler from corsair it's got a 2x140 millimetre fan cooling configuration it uses corsair link which i
[3331.90 → 3336.78] personally consider to be an advantage over the kraken software it's very comprehensive compared
[3336.78 → 3341.34] to what other guys have, and it integrates you know with all your other components which is part of
[3341.34 → 3348.22] what the whole link messaging is about so I am very, very excited to put this on our standardized test
[3348.22 → 3352.46] bench which you can't see but I'm touching right now I assure you it's right there and see how the
[3352.46 → 3357.26] performance how the performance shakes down so that's some of the cool stuff that we're going to have
[3357.26 → 3361.66] coming in the next little bit here and why don't you go ahead and blind side me with the
[3361.66 → 3367.34] surprise i actually legit have no idea what's going on here it's probably stupid just like
[3367.34 → 3374.54] thought it was a good idea okay what is this what is this well just this is separate okay, so this is
[3374.54 → 3379.34] a wrist rest yeah okay but I don't I'm not a huge fan of wrist rest because I don't like really soft
[3379.34 → 3384.06] wrist rest this is really hard though this is and then I don't like really crappy stupid plastique wrist
[3384.06 → 3389.02] rest that usually come with keyboards okay this is a very solid but very good wrist I wish the back was
[3389.02 → 3393.34] grippier I do too and I think I might do some type of mod to change that the first thing that you have
[3393.34 → 3397.66] to do I saw it in a picture and I was like oh that's going to be good because it looks grippy because
[3397.66 → 3401.98] it looks super grippy, but it's not at all yeah okay there you go that's a better angle like it has
[3401.98 → 3408.38] like a texture to it, but it's its more like plastic yeah and I like i read up online and knew it
[3408.38 → 3414.62] wasn't going to be grippy, but that's okay i I'm sure I can do something about that you know what I have some um I have some neoprene
[3414.62 → 3419.50] yeah if you like to take that and then glue it on or something like that I think I have some
[3419.50 → 3423.42] thin neoprene that would be that would probably be perfect because like I knew I'd just do something
[3423.42 → 3428.86] to that, so this is a ducky dk908 did you actually order a new keyboard when did you do this how do you
[3428.86 → 3438.38] have money for this no offence just wait it's pretty cool okay because I'm I'm not if you pulled out of
[3438.38 → 3443.18] sleeve I pulled it, but it like there's a black sleeve there's a black sleeve okay so I have to
[3443.18 → 3448.30] enjoy the full unboxing experience because I'm not really a ducky guy so I legit have no idea what
[3448.30 → 3452.54] this keyboard is, but there's their there's their branding on the front of it wow they actually do
[3452.54 → 3458.30] a really nice job with the packaging this is it's not a standard one this is not a standard one so
[3458.30 → 3464.46] ducky channel.com.tv okay how do you have money for this okay I can already tell from like the way the
[3464.46 → 3469.90] box is uh is shaping up here that this thing's going to be baller in some way or another so here
[3469.90 → 3475.26] can you hold this so that they can see and so that I can uh so that I can work on it here okay
[3475.82 → 3480.22] is this something that I'm like legit going to have to try and jack that is the foam
[3480.22 → 3483.82] doesn't come out so you can take the individual things, so there's a key removal tool that comes
[3483.82 → 3487.74] with it okay so we're not the best kind you want one of the wire ones we should have done an unboxing of this
[3487.74 → 3493.26] but you can't really get them oh remember you can't how did you get it uh you can't buy them from
[3493.26 → 3498.54] standard stores anymore if you go on geek hack there's one dude that has a few left okay so
[3498.54 → 3507.26] there's uh red was keys that are included as well as this the FH like these keys here are because
[3507.26 → 3512.54] in the middle this is a year of the dragon keyboard so 2012 so in the middle there are special keys that
[3512.54 → 3519.42] say 2012. So if you want it to go FHD you can replace it oh it's heavy i love duckies they're so
[3519.42 → 3524.86] well-built ducky and filch and uh cooler master and cooler master cm storm for that matter yeah
[3524.86 → 3532.46] like awesome well-built stuff all right so here it is the ducky year of the j dragon cherry MX
[3532.46 → 3538.62] blue keyboard on the back there's an uh there's a mark that shows you which one it is out of however
[3538.62 → 3545.58] many were produced it looks like so this is number one 86 this is number 186 which is obviously like meant
[3545.58 → 3553.10] to be for me because that's the year i was born 86 but uh okay so here's the uh here's the 2012
[3553.90 → 3558.22] sort of year of the dragon thing there so they've actually changed the text here is this backlit
[3558.22 → 3563.02] this is back what colour blue i guess well oh it's blue back blue backlit okay so we've got a's got
[3563.02 → 3567.02] a bunch of different lighting modes uh one of them is marquee which is more just like you put it
[3567.02 → 3572.06] on a shelf and people can see it so it just looks really cool you ordered this because you didn't
[3572.06 → 3577.02] actually want, so this is why you didn't even care if your old one worked at you no actually this is
[3577.02 → 3584.46] actually for um like i live at one place and then i have my parents place right so when i go home on
[3584.46 → 3591.98] the weekends i use this old gel cap keyboard that i used when i used to play ever quest so i go from my
[3591.98 → 3599.42] awesome ducky where i live and then i have to use this old gel cap keyboard when i go home so i wanted a
[3599.42 → 3603.34] smaller more portable keyboard that i can have at home and then i can kind of haul around with me
[3603.34 → 3609.74] there we go sorry that computer i plugged it into wasn't uh wasn't powered on, so oh looks like it's
[3609.74 → 3615.98] DOA oh wow that is a nice colour yeah, and you can change the brightness levels up here, and you can
[3615.98 → 3622.22] change the modes so function key here's brightness levels okay so it's got a number of different brightness
[3622.22 → 3628.38] levels wow at its brightest that's really nice yeah really vibrant and then there's your 2012
[3628.38 → 3631.98] yeah, and then they've got the dragon key right here which is your function key they've got a
[3631.98 → 3637.74] custom key up here like is that like uh fire from the dragon or something I'm not even entirely sure
[3637.74 → 3641.74] but it kind of looks like if it's not uh it's not consistent with anything that's on here that's
[3641.74 → 3645.82] the dragon right there and then there's uh i don't actually know what this says, but it's Chinese
[3645.82 → 3651.34] writing I'm assuming it says you're the dragon sweet i don't know it wasn't always really look at that
[3651.34 → 3655.42] back and forward oh these are media back and forth yes media back and forth this is all media
[3655.42 → 3663.18] yeah, and then you get into what's cm1 there oh cool because you can have this is like or i don't
[3663.18 → 3665.82] remember actually how to do it you have to like to hold something down for a certain amount of time
[3665.82 → 3670.14] but it's just like the one we saw at CES with corsair where you can like to tell it which ones you want
[3670.14 → 3678.38] lit up okay right, right okay uh the k95 from corsair allows you to just hold down a button and go yeah i
[3678.38 → 3683.90] want these lit, and these not lit, so these are custom lighting patterns that you can have on it
[3683.90 → 3687.50] that's why you can tell it's like striped here except for the 2012 which is solid so it's just
[3687.50 → 3695.98] supposed to kind of look cool and then if we go uh here off that zone like this is all just different
[3695.98 → 3701.02] lighting types oh that's cool i think these are just presets oh yeah so it's breathing right now
[3701.02 → 3704.46] breathing's pretty cool hopefully they can see that i don't think they can see it, but it's
[3704.46 → 3710.46] it's a pretty good effect and then uh i think this is possibly the marquee one okay
[3710.46 → 3717.18] no there we go there we go that's marquee so marquee just kind of like shows it off just wait a
[3717.18 → 3723.66] sec that's very cool it's supposed to do like all the striping is it is might take a little while
[3723.66 → 3727.50] because if it's meant to sit on it's meant to sit on a retail shelf when you're running it in marquee mode
[3727.50 → 3734.38] right so okay um there's one more i have to get it to work sorry it's DOA
[3734.38 → 3741.74] okay for what it's worth guys his old ducky is still working as well uh it's plugged into an usb3
[3741.74 → 3745.26] port so that might be part of the flakiness the computer might have fully booted, and now it's
[3745.26 → 3751.90] all acting up um but the mode that I'm actually most excited for is reactive type so as you press
[3751.90 → 3757.10] down a key that key lights up oh really that's pretty cool that's kind of ridiculous that's pretty
[3757.10 → 3763.50] cool and then on the bottom um there's actually new switches and this is how you set like you can
[3763.50 → 3770.46] disable your Windows key you can swap your control and caps lock you can disable uh something else
[3771.18 → 3775.42] i don't remember them all right now I'm on the spot so the old ducky is going to go back
[3775.42 → 3779.90] to your parents house than probably because I'm very excited for this guy right and then this you can
[3779.90 → 3783.42] decide whether you want to put it on I'm obviously going to put it on, but it's a shield over
[3783.42 → 3788.54] top of this okay so i don't even know why it comes off i don't know there we go that's marquee
[3789.66 → 3794.86] so why 10 keyless um i already have a full-size keyboard and then i have my cooler master that's
[3794.86 → 3799.42] 10 keyless and remember when i thought my ducky was dead i used my cooler master for a while yeah
[3799.42 → 3803.90] i kind of warmed up to it at that point i realized that i got a lot better at typing numbers up here
[3803.90 → 3807.50] i never used to type numbers up there if i ever had to type a number I'd dart over to the number pad and
[3807.50 → 3811.90] keep going okay so i got a lot better at typing numbers up here and then this will be more like
[3811.90 → 3817.10] i go to the island a lot okay whenever i shove my keyboard in my bag it sticks out the top right
[3817.10 → 3821.66] and someone could just go, and it freaks me out the whole time so this is way easier for
[3821.66 → 3826.46] transportation i can just spend it around how much did this cost I'm not going into that this must have
[3826.46 → 3832.14] been at least 200 bones not going into that no come on come on i could figure it out if i
[3832.14 → 3840.22] really needed to no i bet you can't find it okay you might be able to find it in so this is one of
[3840.22 → 3844.30] those things like the m cubed t balancer where i just don't want to talk about how much it costs
[3844.30 → 3849.10] because it's embarrassing because it's just like stupid it's just stupid to spend this much money on
[3849.10 → 3855.90] it okay i want to show the reactive typing mode that's obviously not it that's not it that's
[3856.94 → 3862.06] that may be it there we go okay so it looks like the keys light up there you go you can kind of see
[3862.06 → 3869.02] it now as you touch them which is very very very cool so compared to the electronics that go into
[3869.02 → 3874.70] most keyboards um this is some pretty serious business it's pretty beast stuff that uh that went on in this
[3874.70 → 3880.06] one, and it's cool because it's limited edition and stuff right that's always nice that's very cool
[3880.06 → 3885.10] okay, okay there's not many there's not many computer hardware swags that I'll get pretty jelly
[3885.10 → 3889.90] about but that's uh that's pretty cool and then this is the first wrist rest that I've ever liked in
[3889.90 → 3895.42] my entire life I've actually been using this over the last have you tried the 7g one yeah it just still
[3895.42 → 3901.26] feels plastic really well it is plastique but i find the shape is actually like really i do kind of like
[3901.26 → 3905.66] the shape but i really don't like the plastique feel i like how this one has the leathery
[3905.66 → 3912.30] texture to it because it's real leather um you know what i think i had some i think i had some topics
[3912.30 → 3920.14] that i did want to discuss but um i mean i can't even i can't even really remember what some of them
[3920.14 → 3927.82] were because we didn't manage to launch the uh launch the live stream until we yeah we even talked about
[3927.82 → 3934.62] one of them already but uh I'm trying to find my post that i sent to myself uh patent troll
[3935.18 → 3941.18] new egg shopping cart thing oh yeah right that was awesome okay i can also check yeah why don't
[3941.18 → 3947.74] you uh prep why don't you start talking about that one okay one sec all right so i don't know everything
[3947.74 → 3953.10] behind the story so I'm sorry if i screw something up but if everyone knows what patent trolls are basically
[3953.10 → 3958.46] they either have some ridiculous patent that's just stupid or they buy something up and then just
[3958.46 → 3963.58] try to sue everyone they can and make as much money as they can from suing people because of a patent
[3963.58 → 3968.94] it's not like oh i actually invented this thing, and you're actually screwing me over i want compensation
[3968.94 → 3973.90] for this it's more like let's just gouge everyone we possibly can for as much money as we possibly can
[3973.90 → 3978.94] i bought the guy who actually invented it so now like so now I'm just going to sue everyone
[3978.94 → 3985.26] going to hoard all the like awesomeness for myself, so someone claimed to have a shopping cart patent
[3985.26 → 3991.42] now like i said i don't know everything behind the story, but shopping cart for online carts so just like
[3991.42 → 3999.58] okay let's attack everyone like everyone and then new egg just steps up with lawyer power and just goes
[3999.58 → 4006.22] no and just stops them before he actually got a way able to do pretty much anything new egg kind of
[4006.22 → 4012.14] stood up took the charge and just demolished which is pretty cool because I'm pretty tired of
[4012.14 → 4017.58] patent trolls yeah i mean one of the one of the important things to note about patent trolls is that
[4017.58 → 4023.10] they generally have no intention of actually doing anything with the patent so a great example of that
[4023.10 → 4028.14] would be someone like iambus where they invented a bunch of cool stuff to do with memory and that's cool
[4028.14 → 4033.50] i mean that's fine but the reality of it is that was a long time ago and at this point everyone's using
[4033.50 → 4038.86] the technology and everyone's pretty familiar with how it all works, and you weren't going to build any of
[4038.86 → 4048.78] this stuff anyway so sort of you know pee or get off the pot so to speak um you know calm down
[4048.78 → 4054.62] so don't worry don't worry about it um so actually another topic that i wanted to talk about was the
[4054.62 → 4061.82] German court that ruled internet an essential service, so there was uh there was sort of a
[4061.82 → 4069.98] shenanigans that went down where um a German court actually ruled that the internet is essential enough
[4069.98 → 4079.18] to your life that if an ISP so an internet service provider um causes any downtime in your internet
[4079.18 → 4085.82] service that you should be compensated for it does okay your thoughts i think this is actually kind of
[4085.82 → 4092.78] cool um but come on that's insane but then i worry well there can be seriously critical stuff you can
[4092.78 → 4098.54] not get a job okay you cannot, you can fail an assignment you can like a lot of seriously big time
[4098.54 → 4103.66] things can happen and once you uh bring this to your employer and go all my internet was down even if you
[4103.66 → 4108.70] have evidence they're just like whatever i don't care okay, but it has to be like if there's a
[4108.70 → 4114.30] scheduled downtime then i don't think that should count okay, so the flip side of that argument is
[4115.26 → 4119.82] there are reliable internet connections they're called business internet connections they cost three
[4119.82 → 4123.58] times as much if your internet's that essential to you then you don't mind spending some money on it
[4124.86 → 4132.70] honestly no like really consumer grade basically if you buy a consumer grade okay here you buy a semi truck
[4133.34 → 4139.58] where it's a commercial vehicle the expectation is that thing runs for a million damn miles they put
[4139.58 → 4145.58] lots of maintenance on it, they put lots of maintenance in it, but the maintenance is scheduled maintenance
[4145.58 → 4151.50] that is like it's specced for that maintenance right it's intended to do that if is that truck broke down
[4151.50 → 4157.34] in 300 000 kilometres or 300 000 miles or whatever you don't use kilometres because that's easier for me if it
[4157.34 → 4162.54] broke down in 300 000 kilometres how mad are you pretty freaking mad I'm that expensive
[4162.54 → 4169.58] whereas if you buy a Toyota Corolla, and it runs for 300 000 clicks you're like yeah i got my i got my
[4169.58 → 4176.14] life cycle out of that right if it breaks down, and you have like okay here if a semi breaks down because
[4176.14 → 4182.54] of a shoddy piece of electronics that makes the window not open or like the door lock stopped working
[4182.54 → 4189.26] like my parents SUV the uh the trunk you can't open it because the electronic door doohickey
[4189.26 → 4192.38] doesn't work, and they had to take it back to the dealership and get it serviced a couple of times
[4192.94 → 4201.74] um if that happened on a pro grade vehicle i says pardon yes but at the same time as hey not to
[4201.74 → 4208.86] bring up me being on Telus again and heavy 50 kilobits a second upload, but we would lose internet like
[4209.42 → 4214.38] not like once or twice a month like possibly more than once a day you're on Telus that's what you get
[4215.58 → 4221.26] what the heck why but as a consumer you have the right to change guess how far away the hub is the
[4221.26 → 4226.62] Telus hub i don't even know i could throw something and hit it from my house you're pretty buff though
[4227.82 → 4232.70] that's not the point like it's literally right there like it's like it's across the street and a little
[4232.70 → 4237.98] bit this is consumer grade technology Telus has that's correct telus has professional grade
[4238.54 → 4241.26] uh professional grade service that they provide that is more reliable
[4242.94 → 4247.58] okay you don't there's no point hating on Telus you don't even you're not even a customer of theirs
[4247.58 → 4253.58] any more so there you go i know I'm just like okay here another thing anything pro grade costs more
[4253.58 → 4258.94] and people understand that because well they used to understand that consumer grade stuff doesn't
[4258.94 → 4264.30] entitle you to the same level of reliability that pro grade stuff do i mean a Leon with a super
[4264.30 → 4272.54] micro motherboard with ECC ram that's error checking all the time and like a raid array of boot drives
[4272.54 → 4278.46] with redundant power supplies that thing better not ever turn off unexpectedly, but this is all at the
[4278.46 → 4284.30] same time even with the semi truck this is stuff where it's all on your end you know perform maintenance
[4284.30 → 4288.54] not necessarily you could monitor things you could, you can perform maintenance all you want on that
[4288.54 → 4294.06] consumer grade car it's not going to go a million kilometres it doesn't matter it's just not designed
[4294.06 → 4301.10] to do that yeah and things like a water pump will fail we understand this we accept this in a consumer
[4301.10 → 4307.66] grade motherboard in consumer grade memory that's not doing any error correction and checking um you know
[4307.66 → 4314.22] what you can have a random you can have a random solar flare that blasts it with something flips a bit
[4314.54 → 4320.54] the thing blue screens it turns off we accept this in server grade it's going to find that flip bit
[4320.54 → 4326.46] it's going to say no it's going to flip it back and that computer is not going to turn off most of the
[4326.46 → 4331.34] time okay I'm happy you had it most of the time most of the time, but that's what we're talking about
[4331.34 → 4337.50] professional grade versus consumer grade so an internet connection that is consumer grade should be like
[4337.50 → 4342.54] any other consumer grade thing play devil's advocate this much because i kind of i don't think the
[4342.54 → 4345.50] internet service fighters should actually get in trouble because there are so many things that can
[4345.50 → 4353.50] happen, but it would just be kind of like if internet goes down for a day and there's no like natural
[4353.50 → 4359.18] disaster yeah, and it's just like all their fault maybe you should get a free day i mean the thing that
[4359.18 → 4366.78] I'd like to see is more competition with ISPS yeah so in Canada so while i don't agree that we should be
[4366.78 → 4373.26] penalizing an internet service it's like um there's a there's an um there's like a social what do you
[4373.26 → 4379.90] call them when a group tries to bring change to different institutions and stuff social
[4379.90 → 4385.34] social movement okay there's a social movement called open media in bc that's all about like holy
[4385.34 → 4390.70] crap internet service providers and cell phone providers are just killing everyone yeah, and they're
[4390.70 → 4394.94] like trying to bring reform because we're all just getting decimated with pretty crappy service for
[4394.94 → 4401.98] incredible prices and there's like when there's a social movement being like hey guys what the heck
[4403.02 → 4408.14] and it's similar in a lot of places so while i don't think that we should be able to penalize an
[4408.14 → 4414.54] internet provider for not having service we should be able to switch to someone else that i believe we
[4414.54 → 4420.70] should have the right to choose if they suck and if they annoy enough customers then we should have
[4420.70 → 4425.42] the right to tell them to go shut it somewhere, and we should be able to go to someone else unfortunately
[4425.42 → 4430.22] when there's two because if we have like a restaurant analogy restaurants probably like the perfect way
[4430.22 → 4436.14] to look at is you have a million choices for restaurants if they serve you like poison food like
[4436.14 → 4442.46] if an internet provider somehow like serves you a virus serves you a virus then they owe you something
[4442.46 → 4446.46] but if a restaurant is you go to a restaurant, and they're like we're out of Chicken McNuggets
[4447.10 → 4453.42] and what do you say oh you owe me money for the gas that i spent to come here
[4453.42 → 4458.22] to buy Chicken McNuggets, and you didn't have no they don't which is why i said i can't even really
[4458.22 → 4464.62] play devil's advocate i mean that's just bad luck i like yeah i think like but again like, and you can
[4464.62 → 4471.18] go to a different restaurant yeah, but you can't just flip ISPS every day you can't just be like oh i don't
[4471.18 → 4476.06] have internet today I'm going to flip to tell us for today and then, but the flip side of that is if
[4476.06 → 4481.82] it's so important to you to have internet on that day then you should have a pro grade connection or
[4481.82 → 4485.58] what you should do is you should get a load balancing router they're only about 150 bucks
[4486.46 → 4490.86] and you should have two different ISPS honestly like it's not okay you looked at me like i was
[4490.86 → 4495.90] crazy for saying if it's expensive and a lot of people can't afford that no, but a lot of people can't
[4495.90 → 4501.10] afford semi trucks so they're going to have to figure out how to live without a like i said i don't
[4501.10 → 4507.10] actually really disagree with you, i don't think an ISP should get in like big financial trouble for
[4507.10 → 4513.90] having an outage like and when you consider if they have to compensate i don't know a hundred
[4513.90 → 4521.42] thousand customers for a day or half a day actually that adds up pretty quickly, and it's not like that
[4521.42 → 4525.98] and okay like again I'm not like a bleeding heart oh the poor internet service providers
[4526.70 → 4531.58] they're pretty balling i mean they're pretty balling but the reality of it is they had all their staff
[4531.58 → 4538.38] on that day yeah if it's not like their operation shut down because and if anything their staff were
[4538.38 → 4544.94] working harder that day because things were getting real but then wow does it and wow doesn't make it
[4544.94 → 4551.02] super popular they know a couple different MMOs do it if is it's down for a day you get a day that
[4551.02 → 4556.86] kind of is a thing with some games not all of them with some MMO games right i know wow did it i
[4556.86 → 4562.94] know back when i played EQ now this is all old knowledge because i don't know but like i know EQ way
[4562.94 → 4567.50] back in the day kind of thought about it, i don't remember if they actually ever did but i mean look
[4567.50 → 4572.22] at even something like okay like i would go as far as to say when it comes to ISPS there's almost things
[4572.22 → 4575.98] that they can't control, but that's what i said if it's something like a natural disaster or something
[4575.98 → 4583.42] along those lines okay, okay what if there's just like a power outage because you know someone screwed
[4583.42 → 4590.94] up there isn't usually just random power it can be for what it is it their fault is it bc hydro or is it
[4590.94 → 4597.90] you'll never know like if there's a power outage is bc hydro gonna yeah because i would argue that
[4597.90 → 4602.94] electricity is a much more essential service than in fact i would even argue that electricity is not an
[4602.94 → 4609.26] essential service if it's down for a few hours or even a day depends who you are why what if you're
[4609.26 → 4614.78] living off life okay if you're on life support, but again hospitals are pro-grade, but they have
[4614.78 → 4620.78] generators but not everyone that's running off that like stuff that requires electricity to live is at a
[4620.78 → 4626.14] hospital okay that's true but then at that point what are you going to do give them 50 bucks because
[4626.14 → 4632.14] they died like i don't know I'm just and there i can tell you right now they're using equipment that is
[4632.14 → 4637.26] pro-grade any medical equipment is pro-grade not consumer grade and is, and they've probably got
[4637.26 → 4642.14] battery backups of some sort or a generator or something but I'm just I'm just
[4642.14 → 4646.38] but i would say that for the general I'm trying to keep it interesting by fighting for
[4646.38 → 4651.02] the other side but i don't fully agree with it okay well i don't actually think ISPS should get in
[4651.02 → 4655.66] trouble just for that does anyone dare me to take the legendary axe to his keyboard just to
[4655.66 → 4666.30] totally i think that would be the point where i get fired out of a cannon that would be
[4666.30 → 4672.94] beyond not cool um okay well we're pretty close to wrapping up because i don't know about you but
[4672.94 → 4682.78] I'm getting tired oh sorry um so intel has mSATA 525 SSDs which are basically a tweaked 520 so it's a
[4682.78 → 4688.62] high performance sound force drive which means that you can get up to a 240 gig very high performance
[4688.62 → 4696.46] SSD in almost any form factor now um and along those same lines of shrinking storage to Shiva
[4696.46 → 4704.70] now has an external two and a half inch two terabyte drive usb3 pretty standard that's pretty
[4704.70 → 4709.98] holy crap right that's pretty beast how long ago was it that you could only get two terabytes of
[4709.98 → 4715.18] capacity in a three in fact three and a half inch drives are still maxed out at four terabytes yeah
[4715.42 → 4721.18] yeah i was just going to say that's crazy and like the average one is two i think right now storage
[4721.18 → 4727.58] is just getting so much smaller like it hasn't it's been it wasn't since we went from five and a quarter
[4727.58 → 4732.86] inch being the standard for hard drives down to three and a half inch being the standard for hard drives
[4732.86 → 4739.26] that we've seen a miniaturization of storage devices like this so not only is the performance going like this
[4739.98 → 4746.38] well on SSD it's more like going like this yeah um, but we're actually seeing newer and smaller form
[4746.38 → 4752.06] factors so SSDs brought huge performance in small capacities into these two and a half inch form factors
[4752.06 → 4757.02] now they've taken that same performance, and they've moved it down to mSATA which is absolutely tiny i mean
[4757.02 → 4765.82] Pushkin has a 480 gig mSATA just what madness right do they sell that much no of course because i see i know
[4765.82 → 4770.30] but i see a lot of guys that are just like oh yeah we released this new baller mSATA thing and I'm like
[4770.30 → 4776.38] i don't see mSATA move that much like i never see it on forums' oh it does, but it moves uh mSATA
[4776.38 → 4783.66] sells to a different consumer mSATA is not for uh a desktop hardware enthusiast because what are you gonna
[4783.66 → 4788.54] do with it but there are so many desktop boards that are built in not that many there's like three
[4789.18 → 4793.34] pretty good amount what do you mean that's a pretty good amount it's a pretty good amount for something that I've
[4793.34 → 4800.54] never seen anyone buy it ever okay no mSATA is not for the enthusiast desktop guys because why bother
[4800.54 → 4804.86] you have an enthusiast desktop i know get a two and a half it doesn't make any sense like Velcro it to
[4804.86 → 4809.98] something don't worry about it but then server why don't they just put it in the SSD no, no not for
[4809.98 → 4819.74] server than what for notebooks general consumers the guy who buys a macBook or some Ultrabook and is like
[4819.74 → 4826.70] oh the only way to expand my storage is probably to get a bigger SSD my device only supports mSATA so
[4826.70 → 4832.54] they buy one and these are people who okay, so enthusiasts are more likely to sort of have a
[4832.54 → 4838.46] fast upgrade cycle or whatever else but a general consumer who's not necessarily as educated is more
[4838.46 → 4845.18] likely to see a need find a solution and just act on it because they don't want to do all the research
[4845.18 → 4851.02] that would be involved in setting up a NAS so that they can back up their data there or use a cloud
[4851.02 → 4855.18] service to i mean they don't want to deal with that they just they want a laptop with the hard drive
[4855.18 → 4860.54] and they want it to be bigger that's it and if you look at it from a dollar per gigabyte perspective
[4860.54 → 4867.58] which is how an enthusiast looks at it, you can go oh that's 500 for only 500 gigs instead i could buy
[4867.58 → 4873.66] this drive which is 128 gigs for only 99 dollars at better value whereas if you're a general consumer you're
[4873.66 → 4880.86] going i spent 1500 on this notebook that has a 128 gig storage device or i can spend it by that much
[4880.86 → 4886.30] more two thousand dollars to have four times as much storage device so I'm spending 30 percent more to
[4887.10 → 4891.58] 4x my storage and when that's when that's one of the main specs of the computer you care about i have
[4891.58 → 4897.10] a better notebook now i spent this much more yeah that's another way of looking at it and that might be
[4897.10 → 4902.94] if you bought an equivalent expense notebook you might be happier and get more value out of the one that
[4902.94 → 4907.18] you upgraded because what you actually needed more of was storage space instead of just throwing more
[4907.18 → 4913.74] money at a computer and getting maybe only 50 gigs more did I do my Windows phone 8 talk before or
[4913.74 → 4921.10] after we thought we were streaming oh i don't remember anymore i have no idea we also have to do a giveaway
[4921.10 → 4928.54] oh yeah we have to do a Windows 8 giveaway oh i don't have any questions i don't have any questions
[4928.54 → 4937.18] what should we do let's go with like a Linus tech tips related question what OS did you wait wait wait
[4937.18 → 4938.78] hold on tell me first
[4942.78 → 4947.74] well that's lame i don't I don't even remember what it is i just remember there was that thing like what
[4947.74 → 4960.94] else did we do um you know what um let's let twitch chat tell us uh twitch chat no, no no, no no they're
[4960.94 → 4968.06] not picking the question let's let twitch chat tell us if i ever did the Windows phone 8 things um
[4969.26 → 4974.38] okay i talked about it already okay they say i talked about it already oh okay, okay so I'll pick a
[4974.38 → 4979.18] question while you juggle or something i can't juggle you can't juggle oh well that's a shame
[4980.06 → 4985.26] well everyone's going to be ridiculously bored now no they won't be bored i don't know what you're talking
[4985.26 → 4991.50] about let's go twitch chat what's up how's it going how are you guys you're saying yeah you're not even
[4991.50 → 4998.14] putting the twitch chat up on the thing, so oh press two don't press two over there whatever hey guys

[5008.38 → 5012.70] interesting they're going to say stuff that's inappropriate yeah I've seen some inappropriate
[5012.70 → 5016.62] stuff already hey there's a dog i don't know how that guy did that that was actually pretty cool
[5017.82 → 5022.06] hello from England hi how's it going i don't know what to say you guys saw my keyboard
[5022.06 → 5029.02] that was kind of all i have on my sleeve someone has a dog another person has a person I'm good
[5029.02 → 5034.38] someone asked me how i am destiny's question i didn't see destiny's question read twitter okay

[5052.62 → 5058.86] crisis three beta needs weapons balancing that's not surprising though I'm going to go with like a really
[5058.86 → 5065.02] stupid piece of Linus trivia so I'm actually gonna I'm going to be narcissistic enough to ask a question
[5065.02 → 5075.90] about myself yeah does it have anything to do with windows no that's the point is it not yeah so than
[5075.90 → 5084.94] you're just completely avoiding the point yeah we're deviating from the point okay, okay um how many inches
[5084.94 → 5096.46] taller than me is slick, and you win a copy of Windows 8 i don't even know that okay so we're going to
[5096.46 → 5103.42] twitter we're going to twitter let's see who gets it right first you can only submit one guess each 18 new
[5103.42 → 5108.70] interactions uh oh okay so let's go down i don't I don't know how tall slick is any more okay hold on
[5108.70 → 5120.62] hold on how tall he is can't do math okay so we've got some guesses rolling in okay we've got
[5120.62 → 5127.66] someone saying five inches uh six inches five inches three inches four inches five inches seven inches
[5128.22 → 5135.74] five two inches six seventeen inches come on Brian how short do you really think that i am

[5154.22 → 5158.46] over 9 000 inches i don't know what the answer is so i have no idea if we've seen it or not because i don't
[5158.46 → 5163.82] know how tall you are six foot three inches four inches nine inches eight inches three inches seven
[5163.82 → 5167.82] inches half an inch 20 new interactions no one's got it so far which is kind of funny
[5170.78 → 5175.42] uh what are your thoughts on the FX 8350 yeah we're having a slightly different conversation right now
[5175.42 → 5182.86] which is uh very related to everything nine inches four and a half inches eight inches nine no one's got it
[5182.86 → 5188.22] yet this is fun this is like the stupidest game ever
[5190.86 → 5195.58] nope nobody's caught it yet i like that guy's comment i use a metric system i have no idea

[5220.14 → 5227.42] you in touch with as always our Windows 8 giveaway is sponsored by Timmy tech TV so you can visit YouTube.com
[5227.42 → 5228.38] uh-huh
[5228.38 → 5236.30] Timmy tech TV and uh he has generously donated uh i think a total of five copies of Windows 8
[5236.30 → 5241.50] for us to give away on these live streams thank you so much Timmy that's awesome, and we've done how
[5241.50 → 5249.18] many so far we've done three four i have no idea we're going to keep giving them away until he tells us to
[5249.18 → 5258.30] stop making him broke and giving away his copies of Windows 8 um so i am five foot six inches and slick
[5258.30 → 5265.26] is six four six four, so slick is 10 inches taller than me that's why it always uh that's why it always
[5265.26 → 5272.22] hardcore breaks the uh the framing of any shot that we're both in like when he's been on um net linked weekly
[5272.22 → 5280.62] for example uh IP charger says he said 10 inches first i didn't see it so that's sort of a problem
[5281.34 → 5285.98] uh I'll follow you wait we can check the log that's the great thing about twitter
[5287.02 → 5291.74] um so send me a message, and we'll see if we can, we'll see if we can sort it out if he's the winner
[5291.74 → 5299.10] then he's the winner and i apologize for uh for ruining it for whatever else um speaking of twitter
[5299.10 → 5304.54] unbox therapy is up here so uh unbox therapy is the one that i did the gaming peripheral giveaway with
[5304.54 → 5308.38] i haven't actually talked to him about doing the prize announcement so we'll have to do that very
[5308.38 → 5315.34] very soon uh will we ever utilize eight way SLI probably no time soon the drivers would just be a
[5315.34 → 5322.62] nightmare um i didn't know you were so small or slick so tall not that tall six four is pretty tall it's
[5322.62 → 5328.94] like I'm not even the second-tallest person in my group of friends mutant one of my best friends is
[5328.94 → 5333.34] six five and then one of my good buddies is like six seven when you don't shave you look like a
[5333.34 → 5341.02] Sasquatch it's not even that bad you just don't really grow facial hair well no i oh you mean like
[5341.02 → 5348.54] why are you going to take a cheap shot I'm not even talking you're fired damn it that's twice you guys see
[5348.54 → 5356.62] why i have to fire this guy all the time let's do a little bit more twitter q a how about the
[5356.62 → 5361.34] unofficial tech tips game servers how do i feel about them uh have you even heard about them no
[5361.34 → 5365.82] they're pretty cool and like okay i think he's actually the one to set it up, and it goes like
[5365.82 → 5372.94] Linus tech tips dot com star all capitals unofficial star so they're not trying to like
[5372.94 → 5377.02] be sleazy about it, they're very official very cool as long as they're officially unofficial as long as
[5377.02 → 5382.22] they're unofficial, and it's just you know Linus tech tips dot com forum members, and they are getting
[5382.22 → 5386.94] together and playing some games that's great i mean that's i it got brought up by a mod just
[5386.94 → 5390.38] to make sure that i knew about it, he wasn't like i think this is a bad idea whatever right just so
[5390.38 → 5394.54] that i knew about it and then i checked it out and i was like okay well he put the big star unofficial
[5394.54 → 5399.34] star thing so we don't have to moderate it or anything it's just free roaming and i think it's cool
[5399.34 → 5405.58] that's cool um Logan said he sent the Skyrim mods yes he did so we have the full list of Skyrim mods so we
[5405.58 → 5412.78] can pacify it the same way that he did uh okay there's a whole lot of uh ohs there's a lot of people
[5412.78 → 5416.62] who are saying they said 10 inches first well it didn't show up on Twitter so i don't know we'll have
[5416.62 → 5426.06] to just go back and check it out um okay so i think that's pretty much it for tonight good night everyone
[5426.06 → 5431.58], and thank you for thanking you for bearing with us when we had again more technical difficulties we really
[5431.58 → 5436.86] thought that we finally had made it so that we started on time yeah, and we're really bummed out
[5436.86 → 5442.78] that we were like half an hour late yeah we started on time today we were filming
[5442.78 → 5447.90] and like talking and going through stuff for like half an hour yeah for late for people that just we
[5447.90 → 5452.22] even fist bumped at one point during that half an hour yeah like that's not that's how good of a
[5452.22 → 5456.14] come you guys missed it i mean we enjoyed if it was actually it was pretty all right i enjoy your
[5456.14 → 5462.06] conversation sir it was good I'm not trying to make it awkward no i know and like it was glad you
[5462.06 → 5469.42] really enjoy your oh god it was the first time we talked about a lot of the things we talked about
[5469.42 → 5477.34] we're on the stream so i don't know oh well okay
