[0.00 → 4.32] And like did I show you the registrations? We're live by the way.
[5.04 → 8.24] Oh well it's after party. Yeah, you can show me the registrations though. It's
[9.28 → 15.44] Wow 221 people 239 it just went up to have registered for the forum. This is uh this is
[15.44 → 21.12] fantastic. I mean I think this makes us a pretty significant hardware forum at this point.
[21.84 → 27.92] What? Yeah. Like I was honestly I was at the like I said I was at the Asus Haswell thing where they
[27.92 → 33.60] were showing off all their Z87 boards and like all their cool new technologies that are coming out.
[33.60 → 38.48] Tell me about that trip. We haven't actually talked about that trip at all. It was crazy. Tell me what you
[38.48 → 45.36] can. Yeah, I'll tell you what I can tell you. Um so I mean the trip was good. We were I flew down um
[46.40 → 52.64] in the afternoon in the late afternoon of what was it Tuesday I guess or Monday. I don't even remember
[52.64 → 56.88] it's been such a was such a whirlwind. That was uh Monday. Late afternoon Tuesday.
[58.00 → 64.24] And then the event was Wednesday, and then I flew out 7 a.m. Monday uh Thursday morning and then I was
[64.24 → 71.20] back Thursday afternoon. You know while you were gone I slept for two hours. You know. The entire time
[71.20 → 75.12] that you were gone. While I was gone I think I slept oh no I slept on the plane. I slept on the plane.
[75.12 → 79.60] So I'm going up sometime. But it was only a two-hour flight. Yeah. And it was pretty interrupted sleep.
[81.12 → 87.04] Um you know what on my trip I used uh oh right I saw okay I should tell you about it first.
[87.52 → 93.28] So the trip was good. It was about and it was a day-long thing where we covered DOG. We covered the
[93.28 → 102.48] regular boards. We covered uh tough series. Furthermore, we covered um you know a lot of JJ was there. So I spent you know
[102.48 → 108.64] a good hour and a bit with JJ. Yeah. So talking about the new platform. Some of the. Hmm? Nope. No. I'm
[108.64 → 112.32] trying to figure something out, but I'm listening. Talking about the new platform. Talking about some
[112.32 → 117.12] of the intricacies of overclocking it particularly. How it's going to work. How that's all going to go
[117.12 → 123.28] down. Um you know at ASUS's labs they've spent a lot of time. Like we're talking you know they'll take
[123.28 → 130.96] a sample of hundreds of Haswell's before they draw any kind of conclusions about the platform. Good. So you know how on
[130.96 → 135.20] you know how on motherboards it used to be that you'd turn up the frequency and leave everything
[135.20 → 141.12] on auto, and it would all stay at default. And you know how in the last few generations' auto has turned
[141.12 → 146.80] into let us take care of that for you. Yeah. And the settings are changing. Well I learned a lot
[146.80 → 154.56] about the process. ASUS takes hundreds of chips. Tons of boards. And what they do is they actually like
[155.28 → 159.92] a boatload of memory kits particularly on DOG. They have like a huge list in the BIOS of like
[160.48 → 167.76] memory ICs and like modules and just you just key it in, and it just over clocks it for you. And so
[167.76 → 174.08] that's how they know what the platform is generally capable of. Does they test and test and test and test?
[174.08 → 178.40] That's the best way to do it. And so I spend a lot of time, and they're so educated about it
[178.40 → 182.96] that there's no amount of testing that we could do with our one uh 4770K
[182.96 → 189.52] that could possibly even touch it. So we can take our chip, and we can make our observations
[189.52 → 194.40] but we'll have a much wider breadth of knowledge thanks to ASUS bringing me to this event. And I
[194.40 → 199.36] have full notes by the way that I'll give you. Good. That's like everything. Voltages, expected clock
[199.36 → 206.48] speed. Oh, sweet. Everything. So we basically won't like I sat and watched Andre Yang. You know
[206.48 → 212.00] Andre Yang right? Yeah. Famous overclocked. Yeah. I sat and watched him like to do an overclock. It was
[212.00 → 217.36] actually kind of surreal because I've never met him before. I've seen his name a billion times. Yeah.
[217.36 → 221.20] And I mean it wasn't you know extreme. There was no liquid nitrogen involved, but he was just like
[221.20 → 225.04] this is how to overclock on this platform. He changed like three things. And I'm like wow.
[226.00 → 232.08] That's so easy Slick could do it. Oh, what a jerk. That's so easy I could do it. What a jerk. So uh
[232.08 → 238.56] so that yeah that was really exciting. Um uh they covered some really cool stuff that might not
[238.56 → 243.60] necessarily make it to launch but is going to be coming. That is like stuff people have been demanding
[243.60 → 249.52] and really, really exciting that I cannot talk about at all. So that was really cool. Um. So there's
[249.52 → 253.92] sorry to interject. There's someone from Estonia trying to log into my admin account. It's not
[253.92 → 260.16] going to work. Yeah. Good luck. Stop being a jerk. Leave my stuff alone. I know what you're up to.
[261.76 → 269.04] Sorry keep going. I'm going to go bro. Um. So yeah. So I got to talk to JJ about it. That was really cool.
[269.04 → 273.68] The trip was good. I forget where I was. Great. Okay. So anyway that was the Asus part of the trip.
[273.68 → 279.76] And um so you know those wireless drives that we've made a few videos about now. So Seagate
[279.76 → 286.08] Wireless Plus uh Patriot Aero and the Corsair Voyager Air. We've done three videos on the Tech
[286.08 → 291.04] Quickie channel. Guys if you aren't subscribed to YouTube.com slash Tech Quickie it's basically us
[291.04 → 295.20] and Diesel and B-roll. There's honestly some pretty cool videos. Yeah, there's some pretty cool videos
[295.20 → 301.84] there. Go subscribe because they's going to keep getting content. Um but this was the first time
[301.84 → 307.76] I've ever actually needed one. I was on my way out the door. I didn't have time or space on my
[307.76 → 314.32] phone to put a bunch of adventure time on it. Um so I grabbed the closest wireless drive would
[314.32 → 319.04] happen to be the Seagate Wireless Plus plugged it into my computer dragged and dropped some files
[319.04 → 324.16] and off I went. So I was able to stream wirelessly to myself on the plane which of course I didn't do.
[324.16 → 332.88] No oh no. Nope. Um I was able to stream wirelessly to myself in my hotel room where my internet was
[333.52 → 338.64] terrible. I was able to use it as a wireless hub so that I could have my notebook and my phone
[338.64 → 344.64] on the internet at the same time because it was pay per device at the hotel. Like just wow. Holy crap.
[344.64 → 351.04] That's so cool. Yeah, so I was able to connect with the wireless plus to the hotspot and then connect
[351.04 → 355.84] as through the hub with my other devices so I could at least browse the internet. Wow. Um
[355.84 → 361.68] and then I was able to stream to myself on the way home. And so that was cool. That was awesome. It worked great.
[361.68 → 367.36] That is cool, but I can't even get over pay per device. Oh, yeah it was like just the most ridiculous thing ever.
[367.36 → 374.40] Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Get this though. Okay. Because we'd only ever used the wireless plus to do the uh
[374.40 → 379.84] to do the demo videos, so I never worried about having a password on it. The second I turned it on
[379.84 → 384.64] in the hotel room I was like oh I just realized I don't have a password. You know what probably no one's
[384.64 → 390.88] connected to it. I looked at it two users connected, and I was like okay I better put a password on that.
[390.88 → 398.56] Okay so get this. I'm talking to Logan the next day. It would be. And I was like it would be. I was
[398.56 → 404.16] telling him about this. I was like dude. So Logan from Tech Syndicate uh raised the world with a zero
[404.16 → 408.80] instead of an O. Raised the world on YouTube. Go subscribe because he's awesome. I actually spent a
[408.80 → 414.40] ton of time with him and Lou from Unbox Therapy. Nice. They're both awesome guys. I bet. Even better in
[414.40 → 420.80] person than they are on their YouTube channels. Um so anyway so we're sitting around like the three of
[420.80 → 426.16] us and uh Wendell one of Logan's guys. The four of us are sitting around sort of shooting the breeze
[426.16 → 430.32] and I'm like you know what guys I finally used one of those wireless hard drives and Logan's like
[430.32 → 438.40] yeah me too, and I'm like he's like yeah I thought I was like mine is his wireless plus I connected to
[438.40 → 444.08] it. I was like that was up for like 30 seconds man. He's like yeah I was like creeping it.
[446.32 → 449.84] I was like I locked you out pretty quick. He's like yeah it was just a bunch of stock photos anyway.
[449.84 → 453.12] I was like yeah I had Adventure Time on there. He was like oh I would have totally watched that.
[455.28 → 461.44] Awesome. That's cool. I was like the ninja'd in there so fast. What a boss. I now and then when we
[461.44 → 465.44] went back when we went up to our rooms after the event to drop off our badges and like we went out
[465.44 → 470.40] for dinner um it turned out he was right across the hall because he was like yeah I had five bars.
[470.40 → 479.60] That's awesome. You bastard. What are you doing to me? Like creeping me out here. People in my Wi-Fi
[479.60 → 485.52] and you know stealing my videos. It's like yeah anyway so that's I guess the most eventful
[485.52 → 492.48] part of the trip. Speaking of Adventure Time I'm just going to like segue unleash Linus Fukuyama.
[492.48 → 504.08] Oh. So you went from like a happy discussion topic to rant time. How is okay like okay.
[506.48 → 514.24] So apparently the justification for canning it again is that the um the ratings are inconsistent. So first of
[514.24 → 521.04] all TV's dead. So the fact that the ratings are inconsistent on a show that is beloved by many
[521.04 → 527.20] tech-savvy people um shouldn't surprise you. You have the wrong distribution platform, so I'm sorry
[527.20 → 534.00] that your little scheduled time slot for when you air your little show doesn't work for
[534.00 → 540.24] people anymore. It's not how it's going to work. Ten years from now that'll be dead. Dead. It's going to be
[540.24 → 545.84] completely dead. Move on. So maybe by then the world will be ready for Fukuyama again but um
[547.12 → 551.12] yeah so apparently inconsistent ratings is one of the reasons. Yes it's an extremely expensive show to
[551.12 → 556.88] produce. I understand that. They also have one of the best actors best voice actors ever Billy West on
[556.88 → 564.08] that show who is amazing. Um you know what so he's worth every dime that he pays. I mean all the messaging
[564.08 → 569.20] from the uh the guys who work on the show is yeah we still want to make this, and we're really sad to
[569.20 → 574.00] see it go down. We'd love to come back. Um we won't compromise on the quality. We're really excited
[574.00 → 582.56] for people to see the last episodes that are already produced. Um yeah. That's brutal. Like you've had oh
[583.20 → 589.84] I knew that was going to be hard on him because like I only follow like three shows. Yeah. Four. And
[590.56 → 595.92] always like even the first day I ever worked we had to like stream a video or something. I don't
[595.92 → 601.28] remember what we were doing at all, but it was Fukuyama episodes. And I was like oh so he likes
[601.28 → 604.56] Fukuyama. Like that was like one of the first things I actually figured it out. Like I've even
[604.56 → 610.16] watched the movies which honestly are not that great multiple times uh particularly Beast with a
[610.16 → 616.80] billion backs was not a very good movie but like whatever. Um I thought Bender's big score was all
[616.80 → 620.80] right. That's the one where they go back in time. You know whatever. I haven't seen it. Okay well
[620.80 → 626.08] Fukuyama's awesome. Same kind of deal uh Firefly. They cancelled Firefly. Had a huge following.
[626.08 → 630.96] There's people that like signed petitions to get it back. There are massive fundraisers to get it back.
[630.96 → 634.48] They're just like nope don't care. You can pay for a season. We don't care. That's another thing
[634.48 → 638.48] about Fukuyama is like everyone and their dog seems to be like yeah I'll start a Kickstarter and
[638.48 → 643.28] we'll like to give them the money. How do I get in touch with like Matt Groening and David Expo, and it's like
[643.28 → 650.88] you don't. Like it's not going to happen. They made a decision. It doesn't work that way. Yeah. Like
[650.88 → 655.12] a network cancelled it. Like there are rights involved as well. It's not as simple as like they need the
[655.12 → 658.96] money. Yeah. Yeah, you can't just pay people to randomly do it. Yeah. Someone actually owns this.
[659.68 → 663.92] Um to do a tutorial on how to set up a router in a hotel the way you do. I didn't set up a router.
[663.92 → 669.12] It was a wireless plus um, and it was just a matter of using it as a hub. Watching parts oh I'm sorry I'm
[669.12 → 674.56] I'm on Twitter right now. Watching parts of the stream while in lab. Awesome. You're a boss. Nice.
[674.56 → 678.56] How much of the live stream did I missed which was not loading the video for me. Uh might not have
[678.56 → 683.68] been loading because it was broken for a little bit. So uh that was a bit of a problem that we had.
[684.80 → 689.44] Thoughts on the invite sent out from Microsoft for the press conference on May 21st next generation
[689.44 → 694.56] Xbox reveal. Well we didn't get one so. So thoughts on the invite to send us an invitation. Yeah, if anyone
[694.56 → 698.80] from Microsoft's watching we'd love to have an invitation. Uh although the one guy I know from
[698.80 → 707.52] Microsoft who does watch our stream can't watch because he's at work. So. Sorry man. Sorry Tim.
[709.04 → 714.16] By the way Tim's video on CISA is perfect. Oh. I don't know if you saw it. I didn't see it. Furthermore, I
[714.16 → 718.40] just realized I was still wearing these headphones. I haven't been monitoring for like an hour. Oh, good work.
[721.36 → 728.24] Oh well. Um yeah. Tim released a video talking about what CISA is blah blah blah. It's actually a perfect video.
[728.24 → 734.40] Yeah so uh Timmy Tech TV on YouTube if you guys want to check that out. Um I mean honestly product
[734.40 → 740.96] videos are not really the future. I was looking at one really fast-growing uh YouTuber who focuses
[740.96 → 747.28] most on just sort of demystifying the tech. So you top five you know Android features you wish you knew
[747.28 → 752.24] about. I think I know exactly who you're talking about. His name is um oh crap I tweeted him the other day.
[752.24 → 764.24] We uh he've actually been talking about doing an uh Marcus. Uh yeah yeah Marcus. Um you know what he's got a great energy. He's got great content. He's good. Smart guy.
[764.24 → 794.24] I watched his uh S4 thing. Yep. Because I was like you know what I can read the massive thing, or I can watch the huge press conference, or I can watch this guy's four-minute video, and he'll tell me everything. Yep. So it's like okay. Yep. No he's doing a great job, and he's he's a student right now. I don't think he has a ton of time to do it. So he's just knocking it out of the park. I think he's got about a thousand new subscribers a day at this point. Wow. Huge numbers. He's good. Huge numbers. He's doing all the right things too. And he's doing the right things. And I'm just saying you know.
[794.24 → 803.40] Like Tim's approach is more like hey tackle these issues. Talk about them. Give a new spin on it. Because honestly one of the biggest things that we're doing these days is our live stream.
[804.12 → 813.60] Yep. Every live stream gets three to uh three thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand views. Not including the people who tune in live and uh interact with us on Twitter which I think is great.
[813.60 → 824.52] And it's not because we're like this is the GTX 5200 FX or I mean that's GTX 5200 FX.
[824.52 → 833.78] Well it's FX 5200. It's an old card. Don't worry about it. Um it's not because we're doing that. It's because we're you know talking about things and giving a new spin on you know the news of the week.
[833.78 → 839.92] Or whatever news of the week that we've managed to look at based on that neither of us pretty much slept this week.
[840.86 → 846.88] My news of the week is like this is another feature that I uncovered in the admin control panel of IPS.
[847.40 → 848.98] Hey but there are some cool features.
[849.08 → 852.28] There are tons of them, but I don't even know if I'm like halfway through yet.
[853.04 → 854.24] IPS is going to be so cool.
[854.32 → 859.70] Every once in a while someone's like oh this doesn't work, and I'm like oh that's probably an option that I haven't found yet.
[859.70 → 862.02] Go look for it. Yeah, it is. Enable. Perfect.
[862.02 → 866.02] Unbelievable. So we're going to be able to do all kinds of cool stuff.
[866.02 → 872.82] Um yeah like we're we're we're yeah I can't probably shouldn't give away sort of everything but guys stay tuned.
[873.36 → 874.50] Yeah. Make sure you're on the forum.
[874.68 → 879.94] There are tons of things that are planned. We're not sure how long it's going to take to get it out. Sorry.
[880.42 → 883.58] We have I'm basically doing all of this in my own time.
[884.08 → 892.00] Well okay not launching this forum. I did eight hours of that per day in work time, but then I did almost 16 hours of that per day.
[892.02 → 894.02] Outside work time.
[894.02 → 894.52] Um.
[894.52 → 896.02] It's amazing he's alive.
[896.02 → 897.02] Sometimes.
[897.02 → 900.02] Sometimes it doesn't really make a lot of sense.
[900.02 → 904.02] Um. I have news from Wailer about the folding team.
[904.02 → 905.02] Perfect news.
[905.02 → 906.02] Oh what's up.
[906.02 → 907.02] I just need to get it.
[907.02 → 910.02] Okay in that case I'll why don't I do a couple questions as well.
[910.02 → 911.02] Sure go for it.
[911.02 → 917.02] Uh. Long time list. Oh, hold on. Thoughts on the oh yeah right now. Long time listener first time caller. Hi Lenin.
[917.02 → 919.02] Um. What do you think for a budget build?
[919.02 → 926.02] 6300 with 7950 or non-KI5 with 7870? I'm going to go 6300, 7950.
[926.02 → 930.02] For a gaming build a 6300 is a quad-core. Overclock it.
[930.02 → 931.02] Yeah I was going to say overclock it.
[931.02 → 933.02] Because at stock speed it's not anything special.
[933.02 → 934.02] No.
[934.02 → 941.02] Um. But a 70 more GPU is going to help you more than more CPU in the majority of situations.
[941.02 → 945.02] Um. Does RAM speed make a difference? Depends on the platform.
[945.02 → 946.02] Yeah.
[946.02 → 948.02] So what do you think for GPUs when you're running onboard graphics? Yes.
[948.02 → 952.02] On stuff like the latest generation Intel stuff? Not so much.
[952.02 → 959.02] However, the rumour is that um. That might change, and RAM speeds might be huge and we'll see.
[959.02 → 960.02] Interesting.
[960.02 → 961.02] In the future.
[961.02 → 962.02] Interesting.
[962.02 → 964.02] Okay I'm just going to interject for a quick sec with Wailer's point.
[964.02 → 965.02] Sure.
[965.02 → 972.02] Um. So five of the members from Linus Tech Tips folding team joined up with overclockers.com for the chimp challenge.
[972.02 → 977.02] Basically you try and complete as many, I can't remember what they're called, but they're basically work units.
[977.02 → 978.02] Work units. Okay.
[978.02 → 979.02] Um. As many work units as you can.
[979.02 → 984.02] Um. Within I think a 10-day challenge or a 7, 10 day, yeah.
[984.02 → 986.02] You have 10 days to be as many as you can.
[986.02 → 988.02] And only X amount of teams can join in.
[988.02 → 990.02] So this year our team did not get in.
[990.02 → 993.02] So some of our members, five of them, joined up with overclockers.com.
[993.02 → 995.02] Overclockers.com won.
[995.02 → 996.02] Which is awesome.
[996.02 → 997.02] Cool.
[997.02 → 998.02] It doesn't really mean anything.
[998.02 → 999.02] No.
[999.02 → 1000.02] As far as I know.
[1000.02 → 1001.02] But like.
[1001.02 → 1003.02] But folding completed way more work orders.
[1003.02 → 1004.02] Right.
[1004.02 → 1006.02] Because more people competed.
[1006.02 → 1009.02] It's, it's, it's a contest that only helps things.
[1009.02 → 1010.02] Right.
[1010.02 → 1011.02] So like.
[1011.02 → 1012.02] That's awesome.
[1012.02 → 1013.02] Um.
[1013.02 → 1015.02] It's cool that we contributed to the team that won.
[1015.02 → 1016.02] Um.
[1016.02 → 1018.02] Stanford gets a bunch because they got more work units done.
[1018.02 → 1019.02] Yup.
[1019.02 → 1020.02] Um.
[1020.02 → 1023.02] So our members are going to come and help contribute points for X amount of time.
[1023.02 → 1024.02] Oh cool.
[1024.02 → 1026.02] To the Linus Tech Tips team as a thank-you.
[1026.02 → 1027.02] Because we helped them win.
[1027.02 → 1029.02] And we had like some pretty big dudes go help them win.
[1029.02 → 1030.02] So they are.
[1030.02 → 1031.02] Alright.
[1031.02 → 1032.02] They are extending a thank-you back which is awesome.
[1032.02 → 1033.02] Thank you overclockers.com.
[1033.02 → 1034.02] Um.
[1034.02 → 1037.02] A shout-out to Harmonic.
[1037.02 → 1040.02] Who helped a ton in coordinating the whole thing.
[1040.02 → 1044.02] I think he came over and like helped introduce everyone to it and blah blah blah blah blah.
[1044.02 → 1045.02] So that's really cool.
[1045.02 → 1046.02] Um.
[1046.02 → 1048.02] Right now we have 160 active folders.
[1048.02 → 1049.02] Wow.
[1049.02 → 1051.02] We're one of the largest groups of active folders right now.
[1051.02 → 1054.02] We're in the top 20 of active teams.
[1054.02 → 1055.02] Wow.
[1055.02 → 1056.02] That's crazy.
[1056.02 → 1057.02] Um.
[1057.02 → 1058.02] And right now we have.
[1058.02 → 1060.02] That's based on active folders.
[1060.02 → 1061.02] We're top 20.
[1061.02 → 1062.02] Not in overall.
[1062.02 → 1063.02] Yeah.
[1063.02 → 1064.02] I know.
[1064.02 → 1065.02] Yeah.
[1065.02 → 1066.02] Um.
[1066.02 → 1067.02] And we have over 400 members now.
[1067.02 → 1068.02] Wow.
[1068.02 → 1069.02] So our folding team is like awesome.
[1069.02 → 1071.02] Aren't we top 200 all time for output now?
[1071.02 → 1072.02] I think so.
[1072.02 → 1073.02] I'd have to grab that from Waller.
[1073.02 → 1074.02] Right.
[1074.02 → 1076.02] We were talking about it earlier, but I don't remember the exact number.
[1076.02 → 1077.02] That's unbelievable.
[1077.02 → 1078.02] Um.
[1078.02 → 1080.02] We also have if is folding's not your thing.
[1080.02 → 1082.02] We also have a brink team.
[1082.02 → 1083.02] Uh.
[1083.02 → 1084.02] They're doing great as well.
[1084.02 → 1085.02] They're scaling up really quickly.
[1085.02 → 1087.02] We've got two guys on that team.
[1087.02 → 1089.02] That are just kind of boss mode.
[1089.02 → 1090.02] Right.
[1090.02 → 1092.02] So our brink team is nothing to shake a stick at either.
[1092.02 → 1093.02] They're pretty awesome.
[1093.02 → 1094.02] So whichever way you want to go.
[1094.02 → 1096.02] We're we're kind of 2.30 is.
[1096.02 → 1097.02] Oh 2.30.
[1097.02 → 1098.02] Wow.
[1098.02 → 1099.02] So we're close.
[1099.02 → 1100.02] We're closing in really fast.
[1100.02 → 1102.02] Considering it's been running for less than like four months.
[1102.02 → 1103.02] Yeah.
[1103.02 → 1104.02] And that's all time.
[1104.02 → 1105.02] Yeah.
[1105.02 → 1106.02] So that's like.
[1106.02 → 1108.02] Both teams are doing great.
[1108.02 → 1111.02] Folding just did a bunch of good stuff with Chimp Challenge.
[1111.02 → 1112.02] If you want to check that stuff out.
[1112.02 → 1113.02] That's on the forum.
[1113.02 → 1114.02] Um.
[1114.02 → 1116.02] There are guys that will help you with brink.
[1116.02 → 1119.02] There's a billion and one guys that will help you with folding.
[1119.02 → 1120.02] Yeah.
[1120.02 → 1121.02] Okay.
[1121.02 → 1124.02] I have set an alarm on my phone, so I never miss a stream.
[1124.02 → 1125.02] Awesome.
[1125.02 → 1126.02] Nice.
[1126.02 → 1127.02] And thanks Carson.
[1127.02 → 1128.02] 3,100 viewers.
[1128.02 → 1129.02] Highest I've seen on the stream.
[1129.02 → 1130.02] Yeah.
[1130.02 → 1133.02] That's the highest we've seen except for that one where I think Twitch featured it.
[1133.02 → 1135.02] And I think the first one where you joined.
[1135.02 → 1136.02] Oh no.
[1136.02 → 1137.02] That was 2,500, wasn't it?
[1137.02 → 1138.02] Yeah.
[1138.02 → 1139.02] That was our.
[1139.02 → 1140.02] That was a huge jump.
[1140.02 → 1141.02] That was a big jump back in the day.
[1141.02 → 1142.02] Back in the day.
[1142.02 → 1143.02] When we first started.
[1143.02 → 1144.02] Whereas now.
[1144.02 → 1145.02] I mean you guys have just.
[1145.02 → 1146.02] Yeah.
[1146.02 → 1147.02] You've been overwhelming.
[1147.02 → 1148.02] That's awesome.
[1148.02 → 1149.02] There's a lot of reason for that.
[1149.02 → 1150.02] Um.
[1150.02 → 1151.02] When I up.
[1151.02 → 1152.02] Okay.
[1152.02 → 1155.02] When I upload videos that include a lot of sorts of.
[1155.02 → 1156.02] You know.
[1156.02 → 1159.02] Random Being back and forth between me and Slick at the end.
[1159.02 → 1160.02] And it tends to happen.
[1160.02 → 1161.02] As you can see from the viewer count now.
[1161.02 → 1163.02] Is about 600 people tuned out.
[1163.02 → 1165.02] They weren't that interested in the.
[1165.02 → 1166.02] In the after party.
[1166.02 → 1168.02] So what happens is when I upload that video to YouTube.
[1168.02 → 1169.02] And people tune out.
[1169.02 → 1171.02] For the after party.
[1171.02 → 1172.02] It hurts.
[1172.02 → 1174.02] The ranking of that video.
[1174.02 → 1176.02] The search optimization of that video.
[1176.02 → 1178.02] As well as the.
[1178.02 → 1179.02] Um.
[1179.02 → 1180.02] The monetize ability of that video.
[1180.02 → 1182.02] Because it becomes.
[1182.02 → 1183.02] Instead of like a hot video.
[1183.02 → 1185.02] That people had above average interest in.
[1185.02 → 1186.02] It becomes a cold video.
[1186.02 → 1188.02] That people weren't interested in.
[1188.02 → 1190.02] So if I go with.
[1190.02 → 1192.02] The content chunk of the live stream.
[1192.02 → 1194.02] And then the after party is a separate thing.
[1194.02 → 1196.02] Then it's not going to affect.
[1196.02 → 1198.02] The way that YouTube counts views for it.
[1198.02 → 1200.02] And the way that YouTube prioritizes it.
[1200.02 → 1201.02] Uh.
[1201.02 → 1202.02] When people tune out.
[1202.02 → 1203.02] And so that's.
[1203.02 → 1204.02] That's what I'm trying to prevent.
[1204.02 → 1206.02] I also want the live stream to have a predictable length.
[1206.02 → 1207.02] I think an hour and a half.
[1207.02 → 1209.02] Might even be kind of long.
[1209.02 → 1210.02] I mean.
[1210.02 → 1211.02] We might want to find a way to condense it.
[1211.02 → 1213.02] And then do more after party.
[1213.02 → 1214.02] Afterwards.
[1214.02 → 1215.02] Or something like that.
[1215.02 → 1216.02] But we can talk about that offline.
[1216.02 → 1217.02] Yep.
[1217.02 → 1218.02] But anyway.
[1218.02 → 1219.02] That's why I'm doing it.
[1219.02 → 1220.02] It's.
[1220.02 → 1221.02] Little optimization tricks.
[1221.02 → 1222.02] We're always going to be changing things.
[1222.02 → 1223.02] A little bit.
[1223.02 → 1224.02] Trying to make things better.
[1224.02 → 1226.02] And sometimes those things will hurt.
[1226.02 → 1227.02] In certain ways.
[1227.02 → 1228.02] But help.
[1228.02 → 1229.02] In other ways.
[1229.02 → 1230.02] I don't know.
[1230.02 → 1231.02] Um.
[1231.02 → 1232.02] That's crazy.
[1232.02 → 1233.02] Beast.
[1233.02 → 1234.02] And it's still loaded.
[1234.02 → 1235.02] And it's still loaded.
[1235.02 → 1236.02] Awesome.
[1236.02 → 1237.02] Thanks for it.
[1237.02 → 1238.02] Are you adopting Bitcoin?
[1238.02 → 1239.02] I haven't personally invested anything in it.
[1239.02 → 1240.02] I'm taking a very wait and see approach.
[1240.02 → 1241.02] Wow.
[1241.02 → 1242.02] PayPal.
[1242.02 → 1243.02] PayPal.
[1243.02 → 1244.02] But if PayPal starts accepting it.
[1244.02 → 1245.02] That's huge.
[1245.02 → 1247.02] That's kind of a huge deal.
[1247.02 → 1249.02] You'll be able to buy almost anything with Bitcoin at that point.
[1249.02 → 1250.02] Yeah.
[1250.02 → 1251.02] So.
[1251.02 → 1252.02] Wow.
[1252.02 → 1253.02] That's kind of nuts.
[1253.02 → 1254.02] Uh.
[1254.02 → 1255.02] Bobby says.
[1255.02 → 1256.02] An Intel manager came to his school the other day.
[1256.02 → 1258.02] And he got to see a Core i7 4770K.
[1258.02 → 1260.02] Well don't tell us his name.
[1260.02 → 1261.02] Because he might be in all kinds of trouble.
[1261.02 → 1262.02] Actually.
[1262.02 → 1264.02] I don't think actually showing it is a big deal.
[1264.02 → 1265.02] I actually.
[1265.02 → 1266.02] No.
[1266.02 → 1267.02] Instagrammer a picture of it the other day.
[1267.02 → 1268.02] Yeah.
[1268.02 → 1269.02] Uh.
[1269.02 → 1271.02] There's nothing on the chip itself that's going to tell you anything that's under embargo.
[1271.02 → 1272.02] Yeah.
[1272.02 → 1273.02] Yeah.
[1273.02 → 1276.02] We had a couple other things in the after party plan.
[1276.02 → 1278.02] What else was there?
[1278.02 → 1280.02] I don't know if there was that much.
[1280.02 → 1281.02] Um.
[1281.02 → 1282.02] This week was kind of nuts.
[1282.02 → 1283.02] He was away on his thing.
[1283.02 → 1284.02] Yeah.
[1284.02 → 1285.02] I was like.
[1285.02 → 1286.02] Ah.
[1286.02 → 1287.02] Forum.
[1287.02 → 1289.02] And like email didn't work for a long time.
[1289.02 → 1292.02] So I was constantly manually changing people's passwords.
[1292.02 → 1293.02] Oh.
[1293.02 → 1294.02] Which was crazy.
[1294.02 → 1295.02] We shot a really cool video yesterday.
[1295.02 → 1296.02] I know nothing about this.
[1296.02 → 1297.02] Yeah.
[1297.02 → 1298.02] You weren't even.
[1298.02 → 1301.02] Like were you just like holed up in your room working on the forum?
[1301.02 → 1304.02] I pretty much did not leave for three days.
[1304.02 → 1305.02] Awesome.
[1305.02 → 1306.02] Um.
[1306.02 → 1307.02] So anyway.
[1307.02 → 1308.02] The.
[1308.02 → 1309.02] Wow.
[1309.02 → 1310.02] Anyway.
[1310.02 → 1312.02] The video we shot yesterday was awesome.
[1312.02 → 1313.02] So I had B-roll.
[1313.02 → 1314.02] I had Diesel.
[1314.02 → 1315.02] And I had myself.
[1315.02 → 1317.02] We had an actor.
[1317.02 → 1318.02] And we did this.
[1318.02 → 1319.02] Um.
[1319.02 → 1320.02] It's.
[1320.02 → 1321.02] It's a thing for Samsung.
[1321.02 → 1323.02] So the messaging is going to be kind of like Samsung SSD.
[1323.02 → 1324.02] It's a good option to upgrade your notebook.
[1324.02 → 1326.02] But in particular we are going to.
[1326.02 → 1327.02] Um.
[1327.02 → 1328.02] Yeah.
[1328.02 → 1330.02] But I don't have a pseudonym for him yet.
[1330.02 → 1333.02] So we have a new intern, and he was there too.
[1333.02 → 1336.02] But I don't have like a nickname for him that I can say publicly yet.
[1336.02 → 1337.02] And I don't want to release his real name.
[1337.02 → 1338.02] What about.
[1338.02 → 1339.02] Uh.
[1339.02 → 1340.02] Uh.
[1340.02 → 1341.02] Uh.
[1341.02 → 1343.02] Oh yeah.
[1343.02 → 1345.02] We've referred to him as NG before.
[1345.02 → 1346.02] So I guess yeah.
[1346.02 → 1348.02] I'll go with NG until something better comes along.
[1348.02 → 1349.02] We'll probably come up with something better.
[1349.02 → 1350.02] But for now he's NG.
[1350.02 → 1351.02] He's NG.
[1351.02 → 1352.02] So NG was there too.
[1352.02 → 1354.02] So he mostly operated the boom pole.
[1354.02 → 1356.02] We had our mic on the boom pole.
[1356.02 → 1357.02] So we.
[1357.02 → 1358.02] I felt like a real production crew you know.
[1358.02 → 1359.02] Um.
[1359.02 → 1360.02] So the spin on it is.
[1360.02 → 1362.02] I've got like this hipster friend.
[1362.02 → 1364.02] That calls up.
[1364.02 → 1365.02] And he's like.
[1365.02 → 1367.02] Dude I'm getting a MacBook.
[1367.02 → 1368.02] And then I'm like.
[1368.02 → 1369.02] Voodoo.
[1369.02 → 1372.02] So we do like a slow motion montage.
[1372.02 → 1373.02] Of basically like.
[1373.02 → 1374.02] Me like.
[1374.02 → 1376.02] Smacking into my car on my way to like.
[1376.02 → 1377.02] Go and stop him.
[1377.02 → 1379.02] And like face planting on his driveway.
[1379.02 → 1380.02] And like.
[1380.02 → 1382.02] Epic slow motion leap.
[1382.02 → 1383.02] Over like a plant.
[1383.02 → 1385.02] In his yard.
[1385.02 → 1389.02] And we got like some awesome like slow motion close up footage of like.
[1389.02 → 1390.02] My foot.
[1390.02 → 1392.02] Like skimming the top branch.
[1392.02 → 1393.02] Of the plant.
[1393.02 → 1394.02] As I'm like.
[1394.02 → 1396.02] Voodoo.
[1396.02 → 1398.02] And so I get there.
[1398.02 → 1399.02] And like.
[1399.02 → 1400.02] Dive into his desk.
[1400.02 → 1401.02] And knock the mouse out of his hand.
[1401.02 → 1403.02] Before he can click by.
[1403.02 → 1404.02] And uh.
[1404.02 → 1405.02] So it's just like.
[1405.02 → 1406.02] Epic stupidity.
[1406.02 → 1407.02] Kind of like.
[1407.02 → 1408.02] Like.
[1408.02 → 1409.02] Like montage.
[1409.02 → 1410.02] And then when I get there.
[1410.02 → 1411.02] I explain.
[1411.02 → 1412.02] Instead of paying $600.
[1412.02 → 1414.02] For a 500 gig SSD.
[1414.02 → 1416.02] For your MacBook Pro.
[1416.02 → 1418.02] You could buy this Samsung one.
[1418.02 → 1419.02] It's $400.
[1419.02 → 1420.02] You can swap it.
[1420.02 → 1421.02] It comes with the drive migrate.
[1421.02 → 1423.02] The data migration software.
[1423.02 → 1424.02] You saved yourself.
[1424.02 → 1425.02] A couple of hundred bucks.
[1425.02 → 1427.02] You got a 512 gig SSD.
[1427.02 → 1429.02] You pulled the hard drive out of the MacBook.
[1429.02 → 1430.02] Now you have a spare external hard drive.
[1430.02 → 1431.02] And the SSD is probably faster and better.
[1431.02 → 1433.02] And the SSD is probably faster and better.
[1433.02 → 1434.02] Because it's Samsung anyway.
[1434.02 → 1435.02] Yeah.
[1435.02 → 1436.02] So it's one of those things where.
[1436.02 → 1437.02] Like.
[1437.02 → 1438.02] Yeah.
[1438.02 → 1439.02] It's a commercial.
[1439.02 → 1440.02] But at the end of the day.
[1440.02 → 1441.02] It's a message I feel perfect about.
[1441.02 → 1442.02] Yeah.
[1442.02 → 1443.02] Don't limit yourself.
[1443.02 → 1444.02] To the options that.
[1444.02 → 1445.02] A pre-done computer gives you.
[1445.02 → 1446.02] After market is often better.
[1446.02 → 1447.02] It's a better value.
[1447.02 → 1448.02] It can be better quality.
[1448.02 → 1449.02] And.
[1449.02 → 1450.02] Don't be.
[1450.02 → 1451.02] Don't be a blind consumer.
[1451.02 → 1452.02] Why are you giving Apple.
[1452.02 → 1453.02] Two hundred dollars of extra profit.
[1453.02 → 1454.02] For an SSD.
[1454.02 → 1455.02] Yeah.
[1455.02 → 1456.02] Because I guarantee you.
[1456.02 → 1457.02] They didn't pay more than.
[1457.02 → 1458.02] No, no.
[1458.02 → 1459.02] They're probably buying it bulk.
[1459.02 → 1460.02] And taking.
[1460.02 → 1461.02] Yeah.
[1461.02 → 1462.02] Even more off the top.
[1462.02 → 1463.02] So.
[1463.02 → 1464.02] Why are you paying them for this.
[1464.02 → 1465.02] Why are you giving them money for this.
[1465.02 → 1466.02] It's simple.
[1466.02 → 1467.02] So.
[1467.02 → 1468.02] There's a bit where we show the actual process.
[1468.02 → 1469.02] Of upgrading the MacBook Pro.
[1469.02 → 1471.02] Although it's applicable to pretty much any notebook.
[1471.02 → 1472.02] Yeah.
[1472.02 → 1473.02] And then at the end.
[1473.02 → 1474.02] At the end it gets pretty epic.
[1474.02 → 1475.02] Because.
[1475.02 → 1476.02] He's like.
[1476.02 → 1477.02] Yeah.
[1477.02 → 1478.02] Hey.
[1478.02 → 1479.02] Thanks for helping me.
[1479.02 → 1480.02] I'm like.
[1480.02 → 1481.02] I get like super cereal.
[1481.02 → 1482.02] And I'm like.
[1482.02 → 1483.02] Just remember.
[1483.02 → 1484.02] Always.
[1484.02 → 1485.02] You know.
[1485.02 → 1486.02] I'm like.
[1486.02 → 1487.02] Always.
[1487.02 → 1488.02] You know.
[1488.02 → 1489.02] Exercise the options available to you.
[1489.02 → 1490.02] Don't limit yourself.
[1490.02 → 1491.02] And then I turn around.
[1491.02 → 1492.02] And I'm like.
[1492.02 → 1493.02] Sunglasses.
[1493.02 → 1494.02] And then I like.
[1494.02 → 1496.02] Slow motion walk away.
[1496.02 → 1497.02] But we're shooting it.
[1497.02 → 1498.02] In real.
[1498.02 → 1499.02] Time.
[1499.02 → 1500.02] So I'm just.
[1500.02 → 1501.02] Slow motion walking.
[1501.02 → 1502.02] But then he's in like.
[1502.02 → 1503.02] Real time behind me.
[1503.02 → 1504.02] And he's like.
[1504.02 → 1505.02] And he closes the door.
[1505.02 → 1506.02] And I'm like.
[1506.02 → 1507.02] Sunglasses.
[1507.02 → 1508.02] Cool walk.
[1508.02 → 1509.02] So it's.
[1509.02 → 1510.02] It's like.
[1510.02 → 1511.02] My slow motion walk is terrible.
[1511.02 → 1512.02] I'm a terrible actor.
[1512.02 → 1513.02] Yeah.
[1513.02 → 1514.02] Like.
[1514.02 → 1515.02] We'll be better off.
[1515.02 → 1516.02] Anything that we do.
[1516.02 → 1517.02] But.
[1517.02 → 1518.02] Yeah.
[1518.02 → 1521.02] I'm really excited to show off this project.
[1521.02 → 1522.02] After.
[1522.02 → 1523.02] The funk video.
[1523.02 → 1525.02] Which should come out at the end of the month.
[1525.02 → 1526.02] At the end of the month.
[1526.02 → 1527.02] Yeah.
[1527.02 → 1528.02] That'll be cool.
[1528.02 → 1529.02] That video is sweet.
[1529.02 → 1530.02] That video is amazing.
[1530.02 → 1531.02] Yeah.
[1531.02 → 1532.02] It's amazing.
[1532.02 → 1533.02] That'll be really cool.
[1533.02 → 1534.02] Like.
[1534.02 → 1535.02] I showed that video in it's not finished state.
[1535.02 → 1536.02] To Intel today.
[1536.02 → 1537.02] And they're like.
[1537.02 → 1538.02] Wow.
[1538.02 → 1539.02] This is perfect.
[1539.02 → 1540.02] Yeah.
[1540.02 → 1541.02] Like.
[1541.02 → 1544.02] I think that's going to be the kinds of projects that we're going to be working on.
[1544.02 → 1545.02] And we might have.
[1545.02 → 1547.02] We might have a project coming up.
[1547.02 → 1549.02] A series of three projects.
[1549.02 → 1550.02] Oh my goodness.
[1550.02 → 1551.02] I'm so excited about that one.
[1551.02 → 1553.02] That's going to involve like ninjas.
[1553.02 → 1554.02] Oh my.
[1554.02 → 1555.02] And.
[1555.02 → 1556.02] And guns.
[1556.02 → 1557.02] And like.
[1557.02 → 1558.02] Stealth.
[1558.02 → 1561.02] And I can't say who the company we're going to be working for is yet.
[1561.02 → 1562.02] But.
[1562.02 → 1563.02] It's another one.
[1563.02 → 1564.02] That I'm very comfortable.
[1564.02 → 1566.02] Talking about the quality of the product.
[1566.02 → 1567.02] And the performance of the product.
[1567.02 → 1568.02] Because it's excellent.
[1568.02 → 1570.02] We've been hands-on with it for a while.
[1570.02 → 1571.02] And.
[1571.02 → 1572.02] Yeah.
[1572.02 → 1573.02] I'm super stoked on that.
[1573.02 → 1574.02] It's going to be awesome.
[1574.02 → 1575.02] A lot of fun to make.
[1575.02 → 1576.02] And we have a.
[1576.02 → 1577.02] We have a big enough budget.
[1577.02 → 1578.02] But like.
[1578.02 → 1579.02] We can make what we want to make.
[1579.02 → 1580.02] Not we can make.
[1580.02 → 1582.02] What we can afford to make.
[1582.02 → 1583.02] And maybe.
[1583.02 → 1584.02] Oh.
[1584.02 → 1585.02] Oh.
[1585.02 → 1586.02] I can't say anything.
[1586.02 → 1587.02] But I'm so excited about that video.
[1587.02 → 1588.02] I know.
[1588.02 → 1589.02] Guys.
[1589.02 → 1590.02] If you're not subscribed to Tech Quickie.
[1590.02 → 1591.02] Subscribe to Tech Quickie.
[1591.02 → 1592.02] Because.
[1592.02 → 1593.02] I get the feeling.
[1593.02 → 1595.02] These commercials are going to gradually turn into.
[1595.02 → 1597.02] Us just making videos we want to make.
[1597.02 → 1598.02] And like.
[1598.02 → 1600.02] Having a sponsor message in them.
[1600.02 → 1601.02] Which.
[1601.02 → 1602.02] People like it.
[1602.02 → 1604.02] But that's what we should be doing.
[1604.02 → 1605.02] Exactly.
[1605.02 → 1606.02] And you know.
[1606.02 → 1607.02] Okay.
[1607.02 → 1608.02] Most of the best commercials that are iconic.
[1608.02 → 1609.02] And people know.
[1609.02 → 1610.02] Yep.
[1610.02 → 1611.02] Like.
[1611.02 → 1612.02] Like the Old Spice commercials.
[1612.02 → 1613.02] Yep.
[1613.02 → 1614.02] Come on.
[1614.02 → 1615.02] How much of that is actually Old Spice?
[1615.02 → 1616.02] Yeah.
[1616.02 → 1617.02] Axe commercials.
[1617.02 → 1619.02] It's a bunch of girls running at a guy.
[1619.02 → 1620.02] Yeah.
[1620.02 → 1621.02] Like.
[1621.02 → 1622.02] Has nothing.
[1622.02 → 1623.02] The only.
[1623.02 → 1624.02] The only axe part is the spray.
[1624.02 → 1625.02] Yeah.
[1625.02 → 1626.02] And then you don't actually see it other than that.
[1626.02 → 1627.02] Yeah.
[1627.02 → 1628.02] Like.
[1628.02 → 1629.02] Whatever's.
[1629.02 → 1630.02] I don't know.
[1630.02 → 1631.02] Yeah.
[1631.02 → 1632.02] Someone asked in the Twitch chat.
[1632.02 → 1633.02] Will your commercials ever be broadcast on TV?
[1633.02 → 1634.02] No.
[1634.02 → 1635.02] Probably not.
[1635.02 → 1636.02] None of the ones we've made so far.
[1636.02 → 1637.02] None of the ones we've made so far.
[1637.02 → 1638.02] Because they're way too long.
[1638.02 → 1639.02] But if someone.
[1639.02 → 1640.02] I don't know.
[1640.02 → 1641.02] Maybe.
[1641.02 → 1642.02] In the progress.
[1642.02 → 1643.02] We've made in the last four months.
[1643.02 → 1645.02] In terms of improving our production quality.
[1645.02 → 1647.02] Improving the.
[1647.02 → 1650.02] The relationships we're building as a production company.
[1650.02 → 1651.02] Are an indicator.
[1651.02 → 1652.02] In a couple of years.
[1652.02 → 1653.02] Who knows.
[1653.02 → 1654.02] Who knows.
[1654.02 → 1655.02] But right now.
[1655.02 → 1656.02] Our current content.
[1656.02 → 1657.02] Is not.
[1657.02 → 1658.02] Properly adaptable.
[1658.02 → 1659.02] To go into TV.
[1659.02 → 1660.02] Yeah.
[1660.02 → 1661.02] Because it's way too long.
[1661.02 → 1662.02] Yeah.
[1662.02 → 1663.02] But.
[1663.02 → 1664.02] Like.
[1664.02 → 1665.02] Maybe at some point.
[1665.02 → 1666.02] It's web content for now.
[1666.02 → 1667.02] Yeah.
[1667.02 → 1668.02] But.
[1668.02 → 1669.02] Yeah.
[1669.02 → 1670.02] I mean.
[1670.02 → 1671.02] I had.
[1671.02 → 1672.02] I'd love it if we could make something.
[1672.02 → 1673.02] That goes on TV.
[1673.02 → 1674.02] With that said.
[1674.02 → 1675.02] TV's still a dead platform.
[1675.02 → 1676.02] But.
[1676.02 → 1677.02] You know.
[1677.02 → 1678.02] Yeah.
[1678.02 → 1679.02] It's still that like.
[1679.02 → 1680.02] Milestone.
[1680.02 → 1681.02] Yeah.
[1681.02 → 1682.02] It's still kind of cool.
[1682.02 → 1683.02] Yeah.
[1683.02 → 1684.02] I can show it to my grandpa.
[1684.02 → 1685.02] He can actually watch it.
[1685.02 → 1686.02] Yeah.
[1686.02 → 1687.02] Exactly.
[1687.02 → 1688.02] It's like.
[1688.02 → 1689.02] What.
[1689.02 → 1690.02] YouTube.
[1690.02 → 1691.02] Hopefully his grandpa's not watching.
[1691.02 → 1692.02] He's not.
[1692.02 → 1693.02] It's like on Twitch TV.
[1693.02 → 1694.02] He gave up after a while.
[1694.02 → 1695.02] Did he?
[1695.02 → 1696.02] Oh.
[1696.02 → 1697.02] Okay.
[1697.02 → 1698.02] It's alright.
[1698.02 → 1699.02] So.
[1699.02 → 1700.02] Yeah.
[1700.02 → 1701.02] So.
[1701.02 → 1702.02] Sponsored projects.
[1702.02 → 1703.02] Those are fun.
[1703.02 → 1704.02] Those are cool.
[1704.02 → 1705.02] Someone said maybe it'll be a Twitch ad instead.
[1705.02 → 1706.02] A Twitch ad?
[1706.02 → 1707.02] Yeah.
[1707.02 → 1708.02] Oh.
[1708.02 → 1709.02] Yeah.
[1709.02 → 1710.02] Or like a YouTube pre-roll.
[1710.02 → 1711.02] Or a YouTube pre-roll.
[1711.02 → 1712.02] Yeah.
[1712.02 → 1713.02] Actually.
[1713.02 → 1714.02] I was talking to someone.
[1714.02 → 1715.02] Not that long ago.
[1715.02 → 1716.02] About how.
[1716.02 → 1717.02] You know.
[1717.02 → 1718.02] Like honestly.
[1718.02 → 1719.02] I look at the way that.
[1719.02 → 1721.02] That commercials are done now.
[1721.02 → 1722.02] And it seems so wrong.
[1722.02 → 1727.02] Like it seems like a lot of money gets spent on celebrity endorsements that no one gives
[1727.02 → 1728.02] two craps about.
[1728.02 → 1729.02] No one cares.
[1729.02 → 1730.02] Like.
[1730.02 → 1732.02] You know what the best celebrity endorsement was?
[1732.02 → 1734.02] That dude that did the Old Spice commercials.
[1734.02 → 1736.02] No one really knew who he was before that.
[1736.02 → 1737.02] Now he's huge.
[1737.02 → 1739.02] Make people celebrities through your commercials.
[1739.02 → 1740.02] Yeah.
[1740.02 → 1741.02] Have a good commercial and then you talk.
[1741.02 → 1742.02] Yeah.
[1742.02 → 1743.02] Exactly.
[1743.02 → 1744.02] So I mean.
[1744.02 → 1745.02] I think he already did stuff but yeah.
[1745.02 → 1746.02] Like here.
[1746.02 → 1747.02] Here's.
[1747.02 → 1748.02] Like here's the way I look at it.
[1748.02 → 1749.02] And it's.
[1749.02 → 1750.02] Okay.
[1750.02 → 1754.02] You spend a bunch of money on this content that is.
[1754.02 → 1755.02] Looks really expensive.
[1755.02 → 1758.02] So from a brand image perspective I kind of go.
[1758.02 → 1759.02] Yeah.
[1759.02 → 1760.02] I understand that.
[1760.02 → 1761.02] You want to look like you ball.
[1761.02 → 1762.02] Okay.
[1762.02 → 1765.02] You want to look like you're a legit company.
[1765.02 → 1768.02] And you spent the money to create you know a commercial that's good.
[1768.02 → 1769.02] Okay.
[1769.02 → 1770.02] So I get that.
[1770.02 → 1774.02] But then you know you look at some of the commercials particularly on YouTube.
[1774.02 → 1779.02] When you look at corporate channels where they don't block you from seeing the statistics
[1779.02 → 1780.02] on their videos.
[1780.02 → 1781.02] And you go.
[1781.02 → 1782.02] Okay.
[1782.02 → 1783.02] It's got one and a half million views.
[1783.02 → 1785.02] You know that's a pretty legit number of views.
[1785.02 → 1786.02] That meant.
[1786.02 → 1787.02] That means it was viral right.
[1787.02 → 1788.02] Wrong.
[1788.02 → 1796.34] A lot of the time what that means is that they paid YouTube to pre-roll their video on top
[1796.34 → 1798.48] of all the other videos.
[1798.48 → 1803.74] So you look at something with a million and a half views actually 1.45 million of them were
[1803.74 → 1804.74] paid for.
[1804.74 → 1805.74] So you go.
[1805.74 → 1806.74] Okay.
[1806.74 → 1810.56] So you spent all this money making this video that looks perfect.
[1810.56 → 1812.74] Then you had to pay people to watch it.
[1812.74 → 1814.74] So there you spent a bunch more money.
[1814.74 → 1818.22] And then YouTube is so awesome for this.
[1818.22 → 1822.74] Because the thing about a commercial on TV is you never really get any feedback on it
[1822.74 → 1826.06] 99 times out of 100.
[1826.06 → 1827.74] I mean Super Bowl commercials are an exception.
[1827.74 → 1828.74] Yeah.
[1828.74 → 1829.74] Right?
[1829.74 → 1830.74] Yeah.
[1830.74 → 1831.74] You don't even know how effective it was.
[1831.74 → 1833.74] YouTube is the ultimate feedback mechanism.
[1833.74 → 1843.74] Where you got 1.5 million views and 400 comments.
[1843.74 → 1846.74] It means no one actually watched this.
[1846.74 → 1847.74] Or not even know.
[1847.74 → 1850.22] The one I was looking at was 400 ratings.
[1850.22 → 1851.22] 300 likes.
[1851.22 → 1852.74] 100 dislikes.
[1852.74 → 1853.74] 80 comments.
[1853.74 → 1856.74] Half of which were about how they disliked it.
[1856.74 → 1857.74] Oh my goodness.
[1857.74 → 1859.74] So I look at that and I go.
[1859.74 → 1866.42] If you ever spend that kind of money on a commercial like this ever again, what are you doing?
[1866.42 → 1868.34] You know how much it cost you.
[1868.34 → 1872.54] You know your audience hated it.
[1872.54 → 1873.74] Try something new.
[1873.74 → 1878.80] Try something where maybe you don't throw a butt ton of money at making a super shiny commercial.
[1878.80 → 1880.80] Maybe you take someone with a bit of a fresh idea.
[1880.80 → 1882.48] If anyone from a big brand is watching.
[1882.48 → 1883.48] Linus Media Group is available.
[1883.48 → 1884.48] You know us.
[1884.48 → 1887.58] Maybe you take someone who has a fresh idea.
[1887.58 → 1894.30] Maybe you actually spend some money pumping that content out as a YouTube pre-roll.
[1894.30 → 1896.30] And see if people actually like it.
[1896.30 → 1897.30] Yeah.
[1897.30 → 1898.30] Because that's the problem with commercial.
[1898.30 → 1899.30] You know get this.
[1899.30 → 1902.24] Like here's the thing that I got a total kick out of.
[1902.24 → 1907.58] You know how on YouTube pre-rolls there's that 5 seconds before you can skip?
[1907.58 → 1910.58] And pre-roll commercials that don't tell you anything in the first 5 seconds?
[1910.58 → 1911.58] Yeah you're doomed.
[1911.58 → 1912.58] Yeah.
[1912.58 → 1913.58] Yeah.
[1913.58 → 1915.58] Like what are the odds anybody's going to watch that?
[1915.58 → 1918.58] They have like a fancy intro cinematic.
[1918.58 → 1919.58] Skip.
[1919.58 → 1920.58] Done.
[1920.58 → 1921.58] Never saw anything.
[1921.58 → 1922.58] I saw a pre-roll the other day.
[1922.58 → 1925.58] It was like 8 seconds long or something.
[1925.58 → 1926.58] And there was no skip button.
[1926.58 → 1928.58] But it's just this like chick standing there.
[1928.58 → 1929.58] She talks really, really fast.
[1929.58 → 1930.58] But she gets the point out.
[1930.58 → 1932.58] And then it is just like boom.
[1932.58 → 1934.58] Goes to this thing that shows like a quick shot of the product.
[1934.58 → 1935.58] And it's just gone.
[1935.58 → 1936.58] And I'm always like.
[1936.58 → 1937.58] Whoa!
[1937.58 → 1938.58] It almost startled me.
[1938.58 → 1939.58] But I was like you got everything across.
[1939.58 → 1941.58] I heard everything you had to say.
[1941.58 → 1943.58] It was just insanely fast.
[1943.58 → 1944.58] You got the point.
[1944.58 → 1945.58] Yeah.
[1945.58 → 1946.58] You understand it.
[1946.58 → 1949.58] You have 5 seconds to capture that viewer.
[1949.58 → 1950.58] Yeah.
[1950.58 → 1951.58] And so anyway yeah.
[1951.58 → 1952.58] Yeah.
[1952.58 → 1957.58] Paying for views on stuff that no one wanted to watch is not any better than like not paying
[1957.58 → 1959.58] for the views and no one watched it.
[1959.58 → 1960.58] Yeah.
[1960.58 → 1961.58] Yeah.
[1961.58 → 1962.58] Like if you show them something they hate.
[1962.58 → 1963.58] Like where.
[1963.58 → 1964.58] Is that helping?
[1964.58 → 1965.58] I don't know.
[1965.58 → 1966.58] One thing to add.
[1966.58 → 1968.58] Apparently the guy's name was Terry something.
[1968.58 → 1970.58] And apparently he was big in the states.
[1970.58 → 1971.58] Okay.
[1971.58 → 1972.58] Sure.
[1972.58 → 1973.58] I'd never heard of him.
[1973.58 → 1974.58] I'd never heard of him either.
[1974.58 → 1975.58] Apparently part of that is because we're Canadians.
[1975.58 → 1976.58] But we take so much stuff from the states.
[1976.58 → 1977.58] I don't really know how well that.
[1977.58 → 1979.58] Speaking of commercials.
[1979.58 → 1981.58] Did you hear about the new Kia commercial?
[1981.58 → 1982.58] Kia?
[1982.58 → 1983.58] Was it Kia?
[1983.58 → 1984.58] No.
[1984.58 → 1985.58] Hyundai.
[1985.58 → 1986.58] I think it was Hyundai.
[1986.58 → 1987.58] Hyundai.
[1987.58 → 1988.58] Hyundai.
[1988.58 → 1989.58] Hyundai.
[1989.58 → 1990.58] Sorry.
[1990.58 → 1991.58] Yeah.
[1991.58 → 1992.58] New Hyundai commercial.
[1992.58 → 1993.58] Should we go through it?
[1993.58 → 1994.58] They pulled it off like social media.
[1994.58 → 1995.58] But basically it starts with.
[1995.58 → 1996.58] I don't know.
[1996.58 → 1997.58] Do you want to tell the story?
[1997.58 → 1998.58] Because I've talked a lot, and I'm tired.
[1998.58 → 1999.58] Okay.
[1999.58 → 2000.58] So guy comes into his garage.
[2000.58 → 2001.58] His car's in there.
[2001.58 → 2004.58] And he tapes up a hose to his tailpipe.
[2004.58 → 2006.58] Everyone sees where this is going now.
[2006.58 → 2007.58] Yeah.
[2007.58 → 2008.58] Brings it up to the window.
[2008.58 → 2009.58] Puts it in through the window.
[2009.58 → 2010.58] Gets into his car.
[2010.58 → 2011.58] Turns it on.
[2011.58 → 2012.58] I don't remember exactly.
[2012.58 → 2013.58] Like I might screw up little parts of this.
[2013.58 → 2014.58] Yeah.
[2014.58 → 2015.58] But the general idea is there.
[2015.58 → 2016.58] Turns it on.
[2016.58 → 2017.58] Lights go out or whatever.
[2017.58 → 2018.58] Camera moves to.
[2018.58 → 2019.58] Like it's been an amount of time.
[2019.58 → 2020.58] Like it gets dark.
[2020.58 → 2021.58] Yeah.
[2021.58 → 2022.58] Like it's dark outside now.
[2022.58 → 2023.58] Yeah.
[2023.58 → 2026.58] And then the garage door opens once it's like morning or whatever.
[2026.58 → 2027.58] Like it's been a large period of time.
[2027.58 → 2028.58] It's all foggy in there.
[2028.58 → 2029.58] And it's all foggy in there.
[2029.58 → 2031.58] And he walks out.
[2031.58 → 2032.58] And you're like what?
[2032.58 → 2033.58] And then it's like.
[2033.58 → 2036.58] What does it say?
[2036.58 → 2037.58] 100% water vapour emissions.
[2037.58 → 2039.58] 100% water vapour emissions.
[2039.58 → 2041.58] It's just like wow.
[2041.58 → 2042.58] Edgy.
[2042.58 → 2043.58] Oh my goodness.
[2043.58 → 2044.58] That was on the line.
[2044.58 → 2046.58] Apparently way past the line.
[2046.58 → 2047.58] Apparently past the line.
[2047.58 → 2050.58] Because people did not think it was funny.
[2050.58 → 2051.58] I think it's.
[2051.58 → 2052.58] I think it's effective.
[2052.58 → 2054.58] I think it's impactful.
[2054.58 → 2055.58] I think it's effective.
[2055.58 → 2056.58] I think it's impactful.
[2056.58 → 2057.58] I don't know if I think it's funny.
[2057.58 → 2059.58] It's not sensitive enough.
[2059.58 → 2060.58] Yeah.
[2060.58 → 2061.58] It's not very sensitive.
[2061.58 → 2066.58] I'm amazed a large company like Hyundai didn't run a focus group that told them that
[2066.58 → 2067.58] was a bad idea.
[2067.58 → 2069.58] Anyone can tell you that's a bad idea.
[2069.58 → 2070.58] Yeah.
[2070.58 → 2071.58] Old Spice's new commercial is interesting.
[2071.58 → 2072.58] Have you seen that one yet?
[2072.58 → 2073.58] So they have.
[2073.58 → 2074.58] Which one?
[2074.58 → 2075.58] Uh.
[2075.58 → 2076.58] So many new commercials all the time.
[2076.58 → 2078.58] The new whatever they are.
[2078.58 → 2079.58] I forget.
[2079.58 → 2080.58] The basketball watermelon one?
[2080.58 → 2081.58] The soap one.
[2081.58 → 2082.58] The basketball watermelon.
[2082.58 → 2083.58] Yeah.
[2083.58 → 2084.58] Yeah.
[2084.58 → 2085.58] Where it's just like.
[2085.58 → 2086.58] It's just.
[2086.58 → 2087.58] You know.
[2087.58 → 2088.58] I didn't think it was as good as the.
[2088.58 → 2089.58] As the.
[2089.58 → 2090.58] The older ones.
[2090.58 → 2091.58] Like be a real man.
[2091.58 → 2092.58] No.
[2092.58 → 2093.58] It's just like.
[2093.58 → 2094.58] Yeah.
[2094.58 → 2095.58] It's just like.
[2095.58 → 2096.58] It's just like.
[2096.58 → 2097.58] What?
[2097.58 → 2098.58] Brain explosion.
[2098.58 → 2099.58] Is everything still here?
[2099.58 → 2100.58] I don't know how to react to this.
[2100.58 → 2101.58] I love old spice commercials though.
[2101.58 → 2102.58] Old spice commercials.
[2102.58 → 2103.58] Like there's a few commercials that.
[2103.58 → 2104.58] Just because I find them funny.
[2104.58 → 2105.58] I'll let them roll on YouTube pre-rolls.
[2105.58 → 2106.58] Right.
[2106.58 → 2107.58] Old spice commercials.
[2107.58 → 2108.58] Old spice commercials.
[2108.58 → 2109.58] Right.
[2109.58 → 2110.58] Old spice commercials.
[2110.58 → 2111.58] Usually fit there.
[2111.58 → 2112.58] Somebody's like.
[2112.58 → 2113.58] That's just funny.
[2113.58 → 2114.58] I'll watch this.
[2114.58 → 2115.58] Someone's complaining about the.
[2115.58 → 2116.58] This being.
[2116.58 → 2117.58] Having like a pixel wide thing.
[2117.58 → 2118.58] Our banner at the bottom is terrible.
[2118.58 → 2119.58] Someone made us a new one.
[2119.58 → 2120.58] Yeah.
[2120.58 → 2121.58] Yeah.
[2121.58 → 2122.58] Yeah.
[2122.58 → 2123.58] Yeah.
[2123.58 → 2124.58] Yeah.
[2124.58 → 2125.58] Yeah.
[2125.58 → 2126.58] Yeah.
[2126.58 → 2127.58] Yeah.
[2127.58 → 2128.58] Yeah.
[2128.58 → 2129.58] Yeah.
[2129.58 → 2130.58] Yeah.
[2130.58 → 2131.58] Yeah.
[2131.58 → 2132.58] Yeah.
[2132.58 → 2133.58] Yeah.
[2133.58 → 2134.58] Yeah.
[2134.58 → 2135.58] Yeah.
[2135.58 → 2136.58] Yeah.
[2136.58 → 2137.58] I can't fix it.
[2137.58 → 2138.58] Yeah.
[2138.58 → 2139.58] I can't fix it.
[2139.58 → 2140.58] We plan on swapping it out to some.
[2140.58 → 2141.58] Like honestly some guy sent it to us on Twitter, and it's awesome.
[2141.58 → 2153.58] And it's way better than the thing that Linus spent 10 seconds in paint making.
[2153.58 → 2154.58] But.
[2154.58 → 2155.58] I can't fix it.
[2155.58 → 2156.58] What are you doing?
[2156.58 → 2157.58] I don't think I have the grand.
[2157.58 → 2159.58] Oh, is it good now?
[2159.58 → 2160.58] Yeah.
[2160.58 → 2161.58] Yeah.
[2161.58 → 2162.58] Yeah.
[2162.58 → 2163.58] Yeah.
[2163.58 → 2164.58] Yeah.
[2164.58 → 2165.58] Okay.
[2165.58 → 2166.58] Yeah.
[2166.58 → 2167.58] Yeah.
[2167.58 → 2168.58] Yeah.
[2168.58 → 2169.58] Yeah.
[2169.58 → 2170.58] Yeah.
[2170.58 → 2171.58] Yeah.
[2171.58 → 2173.20] It sucks anyway, and we're planning on changing it.
[2173.20 → 2175.32] Raptor says, Linus, please stream at 1080p.
[2175.46 → 2177.14] It looks like our ISP is throttling us.
[2177.20 → 2177.54] We can't.
[2177.96 → 2178.20] Yeah.
[2178.88 → 2180.52] It shouldn't actually stop it.
[2180.66 → 2183.04] Like, we have the bandwidth to stream at 1080p.
[2183.18 → 2183.32] Yeah.
[2183.46 → 2185.00] We have the hardware to stream at 1080p.
[2185.14 → 2186.28] We have all the bandwidth.
[2186.76 → 2188.64] Shaw apparently does not agree with us.
[2188.74 → 2189.76] Apparently, I'm already on TV.
[2189.88 → 2191.60] Yeah, it actually doesn't work quite like that.
[2194.18 → 2197.12] We want to include someone who's knowledgeable about the subject at hand.
[2197.86 → 2199.34] Hopefully, he's replying to someone.
[2200.24 → 2201.12] I don't think so.
[2201.22 → 2201.42] Nope.
[2201.42 → 2201.88] No idea.
[2202.50 → 2203.88] HP touchpad shout out.
[2205.04 → 2206.40] Commercials on TV are so annoying.
[2207.30 → 2209.20] I think our commercials are better than the ones on TV.
[2209.34 → 2209.56] Yeah.
[2209.86 → 2210.72] They're just long.
[2211.22 → 2211.94] Ah, they're long.
[2212.04 → 2212.32] I know.
[2213.04 → 2214.14] Q&A video series.
[2214.32 → 2214.82] You know what?
[2216.06 → 2220.08] That was what this stream was supposed to be, to be perfectly honest.
[2220.18 → 2223.04] I remember the first ones were Linus Tech Tips Q&A.
[2223.12 → 2226.88] I did an AMA on Reddit to get the questions, and then I just sat and answered questions.
[2227.24 → 2229.74] And I took some more on Twitter, and that's what it was.
[2229.74 → 2232.58] And then it just kind of turned into this.
[2232.58 → 2234.80] Yeah.
[2235.04 → 2235.32] Yeah.
[2235.32 → 2236.58] People seem to like the new format.
[2236.88 → 2239.24] We still try to keep the Q&A there.
[2239.24 → 2242.00] We don't want to actually take it out, really.
[2242.80 → 2244.30] Because we do Twitter questions all the time.
[2244.30 → 2244.60] Yeah.
[2244.60 → 2245.92] I do watch Twitch chat.
[2246.02 → 2248.02] Sometimes it just goes way too fast.
[2248.16 → 2249.70] Usually it goes way too fast.
[2249.88 → 2250.06] Yeah.
[2250.20 → 2250.78] But I do try.
[2250.88 → 2252.44] Like, right now I'm looking at Twitch chat.
[2252.58 → 2254.94] People are saying I miss Q&A and stuff.
[2255.58 → 2256.10] But...
[2256.10 → 2257.54] Well, we're doing some Q&A now.
[2257.84 → 2258.08] Yeah.
[2258.60 → 2259.42] Like, that's one thing.
[2259.54 → 2260.84] Like, we do Q&A through Twitter.
[2260.92 → 2261.88] We do it every single time.
[2261.88 → 2264.98] Yes, we did do a video of the SP120s from Corsair.
[2265.04 → 2267.10] In fact, that's going to be going up on Tech Quickie very soon.
[2268.00 → 2268.86] Live from the UK.
[2269.06 → 2269.46] Hi, UK.
[2270.24 → 2273.46] When you get to the point where Linus doesn't have to be the main actor, put him in the background.
[2273.54 → 2273.92] You know what?
[2274.00 → 2274.80] The funk video.
[2274.94 → 2275.80] I'm not the main actor.
[2276.08 → 2277.16] I'm more of a cameo.
[2277.70 → 2278.52] I play two...
[2278.52 → 2279.74] I do two cameos in it.
[2280.46 → 2281.60] But it's still perfect.
[2281.88 → 2284.48] In fact, it's better for not having me in it, to be perfectly honest.
[2285.10 → 2286.38] What are the best phones I have?
[2286.38 → 2289.28] I think my Sennheiser 555s are the best headphones I have.
[2289.38 → 2290.18] I've heard better.
[2290.64 → 2291.68] I've toyed around with better.
[2292.06 → 2293.18] He has 595s.
[2294.06 → 2294.46] Yeah.
[2294.66 → 2295.50] Which are a little better.
[2296.18 → 2298.60] You can tell the difference, but it's, like, pretty small.
[2298.78 → 2300.42] I got a perfect deal on them.
[2300.66 → 2301.84] That's why I actually have them.
[2303.74 → 2305.36] Amazon, 78% off.
[2306.08 → 2306.32] Right.
[2306.42 → 2308.00] Kind of had to take it style deal.
[2308.98 → 2310.60] Would be a good 512 gig SSD.
[2310.88 → 2312.42] I mean, Ultimate would be 840 Pro.
[2312.96 → 2314.14] I'd go that route, probably.
[2314.38 → 2318.48] Honestly, though, if you don't need the right performance quite as much, 840.
[2318.78 → 2320.04] 840, not a bad bet.
[2320.20 → 2322.16] To get 512 and save a bunch of money.
[2322.26 → 2325.84] Because the 500 gig 840 actually has pretty decent write speeds.
[2325.96 → 2326.06] Yeah.
[2326.30 → 2327.50] 340 megabytes per second write.
[2327.50 → 2328.38] Just compared to the Pro.
[2328.56 → 2328.74] Yeah.
[2328.86 → 2329.94] Compared to the Pro, it's not as good.
[2329.98 → 2332.78] But it's much better than the other sizes of 840.
[2333.12 → 2337.04] I mean, something like an M500 from Crucial is not a bad bet if you want to save a couple bucks as well.
[2338.24 → 2340.68] Should HTC have waited until next year for the one?
[2340.80 → 2341.12] No.
[2341.12 → 2351.50] Because, honestly, just because people's S3 contracts aren't up yet doesn't mean that, you know, there's going to be something better than the one when the S3 contracts are up.
[2351.50 → 2356.26] And by then, the one will be out in the market and everyone who's cool will have one.
[2356.52 → 2358.24] And it'll be the cool thing to get.
[2358.34 → 2359.44] No, I think the timing was great.
[2361.64 → 2365.48] Supposedly, 7990 didn't come out until now because they had been the best of the best at Fiddle or TDP.
[2365.62 → 2366.42] Yeah, it's quite possible.
[2366.42 → 2370.20] These dual GPU cards often end up very limited in terms of production.
[2370.44 → 2377.52] And I've heard of them actually stockpiling chips in order to even make them in the past.
[2380.92 → 2381.66] What happened?
[2382.54 → 2384.22] Did the Twin Frozen 5 Titan?
[2384.34 → 2387.22] I don't know if I ever heard that there was going to be a Twin Frozen 5 Titan.
[2387.22 → 2395.36] I saw that Gigabyte was going to do a Wind Force one, but I think NVIDIA probably laid the hammer down on that one because Titan is a reference-only card.
[2398.06 → 2402.24] As for what's happening with the GTX 700 series family, we don't know.
[2402.66 → 2404.02] It's all just speculation and rumours.
[2404.02 → 2404.86] All speculation.
[2405.02 → 2406.02] Although the speculation...
[2406.60 → 2407.64] Do you have the speculation up?
[2408.04 → 2409.08] No, it's on the forum.
[2409.22 → 2409.94] Check out the news section.
[2410.18 → 2411.30] Yeah, news section in the forum.
[2411.30 → 2414.90] I heard it was going to be a cut-down Titan as a 780 and then...
[2414.90 → 2416.72] 780 is supposed to be a GK110 GPU.
[2417.00 → 2417.58] Yeah, GK110.
[2418.00 → 2422.64] That's what people are speculating, that the Titan LE rumours were actually 780.
[2423.08 → 2424.04] Yeah, that's the speculation.
[2424.38 → 2425.42] We actually don't know.
[2425.48 → 2427.10] If we knew, we wouldn't be able to talk about it.
[2427.18 → 2427.40] Yeah.
[2427.84 → 2432.72] And then the rumour is 770 is going to be a 680 or something.
[2432.74 → 2433.06] Okay.
[2433.48 → 2434.22] Yeah, I don't know.
[2434.24 → 2434.62] I don't know.
[2434.90 → 2438.02] We actually don't know, and even if we did know, we wouldn't be able to say.
[2438.02 → 2438.92] We wouldn't be able to tell you.
[2439.10 → 2439.28] Yeah.
[2439.48 → 2441.02] So, yeah, we'll see what happens.
[2441.02 → 2442.62] I mean, the thing that I...
[2442.62 → 2447.94] The pattern to watch for is that when the rumours start, like, really getting going is
[2447.94 → 2451.10] when it's probably time to start paying attention because it's probably coming at some point.
[2452.28 → 2454.54] It's just the pattern that I've noticed over the years.
[2455.56 → 2455.96] Yeah.
[2456.66 → 2457.02] Okay.
[2457.20 → 2460.80] Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'm probably going to...
[2460.80 → 2462.14] Yes, there's a live stream this week.
[2463.76 → 2465.98] But I think I'm probably going to call it quits.
[2466.06 → 2466.52] We should...
[2466.52 → 2467.32] You know what we should do?
[2467.32 → 2473.26] Is we should schedule our Super Mario World stream as an after party.
[2474.18 → 2475.56] Since it won't be so late at night.
[2476.74 → 2478.38] That could take so long, though.
[2479.30 → 2482.06] We could do it as part one, part two, part three, or something like that.
[2482.20 → 2483.56] So we could do it over a span of...
[2483.56 → 2485.04] Maybe we start doing after...
[2485.04 → 2486.84] Because, like, one person will be playing at a time.
[2486.84 → 2492.30] So maybe we do after party while we're playing Super Mario.
[2492.60 → 2492.82] Yeah.
[2493.18 → 2494.50] Just not have us on screen.
[2494.60 → 2495.30] We're not that interesting.
[2495.42 → 2499.98] So we'll do our stream, and then we'll, like, call the gear over there.
[2500.26 → 2504.68] Or we could even just set it up on a monitor right there.
[2504.92 → 2505.70] Stream the gear...
[2505.70 → 2506.68] Oh, on a monitor?
[2506.90 → 2509.62] No, because we could use BenQ's gaming series one.
[2511.46 → 2511.86] Okay.
[2512.30 → 2512.90] That could work.
[2513.28 → 2514.22] Or that CRT.
[2514.22 → 2515.58] Or the CRT.
[2515.80 → 2516.84] Oh, it's VGA-in only.
[2517.56 → 2518.34] We'd need a converter.
[2519.04 → 2519.46] Super Nintendo.
[2519.56 → 2519.96] Oh, right.
[2520.00 → 2523.44] We could play on a real Super Nintendo.
[2523.90 → 2524.26] Yes.
[2525.62 → 2526.34] You own the game.
[2526.62 → 2527.42] Yeah, I only get...
[2527.42 → 2528.34] No, it's not, technically.
[2528.94 → 2529.78] I didn't say anything.
[2530.12 → 2530.52] What do you...
[2530.52 → 2530.68] What?
[2532.66 → 2533.62] Okay, goodnight, everyone.
[2535.76 → 2537.18] Don't forget to tune in next week.
