[0.00 → 7.00] all right and never live I don't know how much I should really get started at this point given that
[7.00 → 8.00] uh...
[8.00 → 14.00] no one's really tuned in yet and I also don't even know if like my mic is working or anything like that so just as a quick sort of
[14.00 → 17.00] sound check if anyone wants to
[17.00 → 21.00] let me know if it's working on Twitter is Linus tax so if you
[21.00 → 25.00] tuned in then now is the time so I've got twitter open on my other feed
[25.00 → 32.00] and I guess we've got our first question of the night so I'm going to be doing mostly the questions that people posted on the Reddit
[32.00 → 37.00] am a thread so I had an ask me anything thread that got about
[37.00 → 44.00] three hundred comments or so before I even started replying to some of them in there and then I got at least about twenty thirty questions that were perfect and I thought that I would cover on the live stream here
[44.00 → 47.00] so I think that's a great question for you guys
[47.00 → 51.00] and I think that's a great question for you guys
[51.00 → 54.00] so I've got just one twitter question before we really get started and that's uh...
[54.00 → 61.00] running nine hundred p resolution and love my textures is two gig worth it over the one gig sixty-eight fifty sixty-eight seventy so
[61.00 → 64.00] the answer to that's actually pretty simple
[64.00 → 68.00] you're going to be running into uh...
[68.00 → 71.00] a GPU
[71.00 → 73.00] power limitation
[73.00 → 80.00] before you're going to be running into a situation where you need more memory
[80.00 → 87.00] because by the time you start pushing huge textures and huge performance out of a sixty-eight fifty or sixty-eight seventy
[87.00 → 88.00] uh...
[88.00 → 89.00] uh...
[89.00 → 93.00] yeah it's just it's just not going to happen by the time you would need to fill up two gigs of VRAM
[93.00 → 95.00] your GPU would be the limit not the video memory
[95.00 → 98.00] unless you're running like a triple monitor setup
[98.00 → 102.00] and you're running kind of older games so then you'd need more memory and less GPU power but at that point you
[102.00 → 104.00] probably don't even memory anyway so
[104.00 → 107.00] you only really benefit from more memory once you start getting into higher-end video cards
[107.00 → 111.00] so anything higher end than say you like a five seventy-five eighty at this point is where you're really going to see the benefit
[111.00 → 116.00] although I guess on the AMD side, so something like a sixty-nine seventy or up
[116.00 → 119.00] is where you'd see a difference we've got about ten more tweets um...
[119.00 → 126.00] I'm gonna wait till we've got at least around five hundred viewers turned tuned in before I start to do the real questions so
[126.00 → 134.00] I've got some twitter stuff to do uh... what's this headset you're using this is a pc one thirty-one or one sixty-one or something like that's an older one
[134.00 → 141.00] uh... the mic's great it's phenomenally uncomfortable but the mic's great so that's why I'm using it for this
[141.00 → 146.00] I don't really like the mic on this webcam here so
[146.00 → 149.00] uh... what are the specs of my wife's pc
[149.00 → 151.00] I don't remember
[151.00 → 155.00] Von do you remember what CPU I said I put in your computer
[155.00 → 158.00] she doesn't remember either
[158.00 → 161.00] okay so I think I'm going to be able to do that
[161.00 → 164.00] she doesn't remember either okay so I think it's a twenty-six hundred k in there
[164.00 → 176.00] no, no now I remember I totally changed it she's got a nine eighty x with a MSI big bang x power uh... twelve gigs of Oct ddr3 two thousand
[176.00 → 179.00] she's got a fifty-eight seventy with an after market cooler on it
[179.00 → 184.00] and it's all running off of the pc powering cooling six hundred watt power supply
[184.00 → 189.00] um... her boot drive is on Oct vertex four to fifty-six gig
[189.00 → 192.00] so let's see that's a pretty decent machine
[192.00 → 200.00] how much of the difference is there between a fennel two x six at four point six gig or four point five gigahertz over a stock FX eighty-one fifty
[200.00 → 207.00] you know what that's a very specific question almost no one to be able to answer that because it really depends on the application there are some things for fennel
[207.00 → 217.00] twos are actually faster than FX chips and there are other things where the FX chips start to pull away um... due to the fact that they have more power in some ways and less in other ways
[217.00 → 227.00] uh... what I'm really excited to see is what AMD can bring to the table with their upcoming architecture so I don't have sample chips yet but as soon as I get my hands on them, I'll uh...
[227.00 → 235.00] I'll definitely be excited about testing them it's been a while since we've seen a really competitive CPU from AMD so I'm really hoping that they can pull it together on this one
[235.00 → 238.00] how are rocket and rumble they're good
[238.00 → 242.00] shout-outs for jello as well as freezy seven eight six five
[242.00 → 244.00] okay hello
[244.00 → 245.00] you guys got a shout-out
[245.00 → 257.00] uh... I'm going to be building my first build writes in Adam is overclocking that worth it, and it depends do you like performance for free or do you like spending money on it
[257.00 → 264.00] if the answer is you like performance for free then I think you want overclock if the answer is that you want to spend money for your performance then spend more money
[264.00 → 279.00] I don't think there's any sort of mystical art here anything like that overclocking has gotten so simple these days that uh... compared to I mean compared to come on ten fifteen years ago
[279.00 → 286.00] you were like rearranging jumpers on the motherboard to change bus speeds and lower multipliers to make everything balance out and not immediately crash the system compared to now
[286.00 → 291.00] when you just buy a case series or a black edition CPU
[291.00 → 293.00] turn the multiplier up
[293.00 → 295.00] turn the voltage up
[295.00 → 299.00] do some googling around to get some good starting points and your overclock is done so it's
[299.00 → 303.00] very straightforward these days I would definitely suggest overclocking to be worth it also
[303.00 → 307.00] you can check out my uh... my video review of the empowers e77 board
[307.00 → 309.00] that I did quite recently
[309.00 → 310.00] um...
[310.00 → 315.00] the overclocked performance versus stock performance comparison that I do is applicable to almost any board
[315.00 → 319.00] yes that board is you know OC certified, but that's not to say that any z77 board
[319.00 → 322.00] wouldn't have been capable of an overclock like that
[322.00 → 327.00] I have an i5 2320 and an AMD Radeon hd64 50
[327.00 → 346.00] what should be my first upgrade says tanner get rid of that video card it's actually not even that much better than the onboard GPU on your CPU so yeah you definitely need a new graphics card
[346.00 → 354.00] Linus what do you think about the Maximus five extreme I actually don't see the point of the Maximus five extreme over the Maximus five formulae because the formula has that
[354.00 → 361.00] well if you get the thunder FX version it has that awesome external USB sound card with the noise cancellation
[361.00 → 367.00] uh... feature that basically listens to your voice with an external mic and then cancels out the sound of yourself talking
[367.00 → 372.00] through your uh... through your headphones, or maybe it's the other way no, no sorry, sorry
[372.00 → 377.00] it listens to the ambient noise around it and then cancels that out from your voice talking so it's pretty cool
[377.00 → 384.00] uh... for
[384.00 → 386.00] uh...
[386.00 → 395.00] so I'm into extreme overclocking and I was able to push a 6870 to 1.4 gigahertz core how's that compared to a stock 7950
[395.00 → 401.00] uh... if you're into extreme overclocking you should probably already know how to figure that out uh... you want to use something like the orb
[401.00 → 408.00] uh... from future mark and you can benchmark your card, and then you can compare it to other people who have submitted benchmarks from a stock
[408.00 → 416.00] 7970 although I can tell you right now a 6870 is not anywhere near a 7970 no matter how many gigahertz it is with video cards it is
[416.00 → 422.00] never anything to do with what the clock speed is or uh... you know what the memories
[422.00 → 429.00] uh... sorry uh... bus width is its none of that is relevant what's relevant is the architecture that's being used
[429.00 → 434.00] and you can only really compare similar architectures to other similar architectures so
[434.00 → 440.00] for example uh... we were able to easily figure out the performance of GTX 570 versus 480
[440.00 → 444.00] because they used pretty much the same architecture just with some efficiencies added for the 570
[444.00 → 451.00] so that's how people who knew what the spec was before it was released knew it was going to perform pretty much identically to a 480 before it came out
[451.00 → 453.00] which isn't to say
[453.00 → 455.00] that you could have compared the
[455.00 → 458.00] uh... the frequency of the upcoming 670
[458.00 → 464.00] or 680 and thought that maybe that would somehow be comparable to the opens because this is a Kepler architecture
[464.00 → 467.00] not a fermi architecture is totally different
[467.00 → 469.16] just
[469.16 → 474.00] your wife has the Utah
[474.00 → 476.00] 6.7
[476.00 → 478.00] yeah she has an Utah
[478.00 → 482.00] 6.5870, but she's only running a single uh... a single display off of it
[482.00 → 485.00] vertex for verses Samsung eight thirty SSD for gaming
[485.00 → 488.00] your SSD will make exactly this much performance difference for gaming so don't worry too much about it
[489.00 → 491.00] either of those are good choices
[491.00 → 495.00] well no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no
[495.00 → 497.32] those are good choices.
[497.32 → 500.86] Just a reminder for those of you who aren't following on Twitter, I am taking questions
[500.86 → 505.82] via Twitter up until we get 500 viewers, although we just crossed 500 viewers, so I'm at Linus
[505.82 → 509.28] Tech on Twitter, L-I-N-U-S-T-E-C-H.
[509.28 → 512.50] So if you want to submit questions there, as long as it doesn't get too overwhelming,
[512.50 → 515.64] I will try to be answering questions live as well.
[515.64 → 518.36] What's the difference between DPI and CPI in a mouse?
[518.36 → 524.12] CPI is only really used by Steel Series, and it basically can be derived from the DPI of
[524.12 → 529.52] a mouse, so they're not inherently different is my understanding of them.
[529.52 → 533.98] Their philosophy is that CPI is a more accurate measurement of how sensitive the mouse can
[533.98 → 539.18] be, and while they may be right, and they may be wrong, usually it doesn't really come down
[539.18 → 542.74] to what the DPI of the mouse is to determine performance anyway.
[542.74 → 550.28] It's more to do with the quality of the laser and the quality of the components inside when
[550.28 → 551.96] it comes to how well it tracks.
[551.96 → 556.36] So for me, I usually have to sit down with the mouse and kind of play around with it
[556.36 → 557.36] a little bit.
[557.36 → 560.62] Even at the Windows desktop, you can get a perfect feel for how well a mouse's sensor
[560.62 → 565.82] is tracking versus one that's not tracking very well at all.
[565.82 → 568.96] I have an i5-3570K and a 560 Ti.
[568.96 → 570.42] Should I upgrade the GPU?
[570.42 → 574.04] You certainly could, especially if you want to overclock your CPU a little bit, squeeze
[574.04 → 575.32] more performance out of it.
[575.32 → 578.96] Something like a 660 Ti would be a great upgrade from that 560.
[578.96 → 582.36] Speaking of which, I know my 560 numbers were no good in my recent benchmarks.
[582.36 → 586.36] I brought my 560 home this weekend, and I'm going to play around with it a little bit.
[586.36 → 587.62] I think there's something wrong with it.
[587.62 → 592.36] Those are the real numbers I got off of my reference 560 Ti, so I don't know what to tell
[592.36 → 593.36] you guys.
[593.36 → 594.36] It used to work fine.
[594.36 → 598.36] There's no artifacts or anything, but the performance numbers are just abysmal.
[598.36 → 603.16] So, I really don't know what happened with that.
[603.16 → 606.36] Are we going to do any pre-overclocked $2000 machines in the near future?
[606.36 → 607.36] You know what?
[607.36 → 608.76] Email thecrazyrussian at pc at NCIX.com.
[608.76 → 610.76] He'd know better than me.
[610.76 → 614.76] He's handling 99% of the PC stuff at NCI these days.
[614.76 → 619.36] I have very little involvement other than just sort of collaborating with him on it,
[619.36 → 623.86] making sure I do the videos, and making sure that I agree with what he's doing so that
[623.86 → 627.56] when I do the video talking about how great the system is, I actually think it is really
[627.56 → 628.56] great.
[628.56 → 633.36] What wattage do you think I need for 6790s in Crossfire?
[633.36 → 634.36] 6790?
[634.36 → 639.42] I'm going to let you sort of see if you want to correct that because I haven't heard of that
[639.42 → 640.76] card, although maybe it exists.
[640.76 → 644.92] Okay, so we've got so many people watching now that since I started answering questions
[644.92 → 648.94] on Twitter, I have 46 new Twitter questions.
[648.94 → 653.44] So I'm going to have to turn off Twitter for a little bit and let's start addressing some
[653.44 → 658.74] of the questions that came through on the Reddit post in the Ask Me Anything section.
[658.74 → 663.84] So question number one at the top of my list is, hey, it's Linus.
[663.84 → 664.84] This is from Sweet Coffee.
[664.84 → 665.84] Hey, it's Linus.
[665.84 → 667.80] Where did that purple gecko hat go?
[667.80 → 670.24] The purple gecko hat actually hasn't gone anywhere.
[670.24 → 675.40] I just haven't been wearing it because it's, you know, I think it kind of got old a little
[675.40 → 676.40] bit.
[676.40 → 681.24] But for those of you who don't know, this is the legendary purple gecko hat, the horrible,
[681.24 → 688.12] horrible hat that I used to wear in many earlier NCI Tech Tips episodes that have a bit of a
[688.12 → 689.36] special history for me.
[689.36 → 695.08] So this hat was, believe it or not, I think I paid about 25, 35 bucks for it or something
[695.08 → 696.08] like that.
[696.08 → 701.52] This is hand painted, well, hand airbrushed by an artist in Victoria who just was like
[701.52 → 705.16] selling these hats on the sea wall down there.
[705.16 → 706.08] And like this is cool.
[706.08 → 707.08] Like you can, it's washable.
[707.08 → 708.08] It's machine washable.
[708.08 → 709.08] I've washed it.
[709.08 → 711.24] He's using a really high quality fabric paint.
[711.24 → 714.24] And it's actually got like a lot of, you know, cool detail to it.
[714.24 → 715.24] I love airbrushed artwork.
[715.24 → 719.24] So you can see the gecko's giving me kind of the stare-down, and it looks like he's kind
[719.24 → 721.24] of got like a ground thing going on here.
[721.24 → 725.24] You can actually see right through it, like this is not a printed design.
[725.24 → 727.24] This is an airbrushed on design.
[727.24 → 728.24] So the hat hasn't gone anywhere.
[728.24 → 731.24] It's just been living in my nightstand and I haven't really been wearing it.
[731.24 → 732.24] So there you go.
[732.24 → 733.24] That's question number one.
[733.24 → 740.24] Question number two from Neo Vitamin is do you feel that Intel's de facto monopoly on
[740.24 → 742.24] CPUs will hurt the end user?
[742.24 → 743.24] If yes, how?
[743.24 → 744.24] Absolutely.
[744.24 → 749.24] I mean, we saw what happened last time around where Intel's innovation really slowed down.
[749.24 → 756.24] I personally think that if they had more pressure from AMD, they would, I mean, their philosophy
[756.24 → 759.24] right now is a lot to do with performance per watt, which is great.
[759.24 → 761.24] I mean, I'm all about energy efficiency.
[761.24 → 762.24] That stuff's perfect.
[762.24 → 766.24] But I think if there was more pressure from AMD's eight cores, for example, we'd already
[766.24 → 768.24] have an eight core extreme edition.
[768.24 → 776.24] I don't know if you guys know this, but the extreme edition 3960X has eight cores in it.
[776.24 → 778.24] Two of them are turned off.
[778.24 → 784.24] So there are Leon editions using that same architecture that have eight cores, but due to the fact that
[784.24 → 789.24] there's really no pressure and Intel can sort of stick with their design philosophy of keeping
[789.24 → 792.24] within a certain TDP at a certain clock speed.
[792.24 → 795.24] They just haven't felt the need to enable those for enthusiasts.
[795.24 → 801.24] And I would love to see cheaper six cores and available eight cores from Intel, but there's...
[801.24 → 807.24] I mean, we're already seeing the effects, I guess, on Intel's dominance in CPU because they
[807.24 → 808.24] don't... they just don't have to do it.
[808.24 → 809.24] They can keep their yields.
[809.24 → 814.24] So the reality of it is if they're going to sell an extreme edition for a thousand bucks, they're
[814.24 → 820.24] better off to make it easier to make an extreme edition versus having to bin them more carefully
[820.24 → 821.24] to get an extreme edition.
[821.24 → 825.24] If they had to get eight cores at three point whatever gigahertz, then they would be able
[825.24 → 831.24] to use fewer of them for extreme editions versus if they only need six of the cores to be going 100%.
[831.24 → 836.24] A question from divided by 49.
[836.24 → 839.24] How did you come to be the face of NCI?
[839.24 → 843.24] Representing an awesome tech company and making videos for them seems like a dream come true.
[843.24 → 848.24] Well, the sort of realistic answer to that is that there was a lot of luck.
[848.24 → 852.24] I was in the right place at the right time with the right sort of product knowledge.
[852.24 → 855.24] They were looking for someone internally where I was sort of...
[855.24 → 861.24] I was really the only viable candidate who likes to, you know, do this and also, you
[861.24 → 866.24] know, knows the... cares about it, you know, really is passionate about the technology.
[866.24 → 872.24] And I mean, when we started Tech Tips, it was never sales driven.
[872.24 → 876.24] That was one of the things that we learned really early on from Tiger Direct Blog who were
[876.24 → 877.24] the leaders at the time.
[877.24 → 878.24] They had...
[878.24 → 884.24] That was back when Logan was doing it, and they had so much built in...
[884.24 → 886.24] Sorry, I've got to scratch my nose here.
[886.24 → 887.24] Sorry, sorry.
[887.24 → 892.24] They had so much built in viewership, so many subscribers and such huge traffic.
[892.24 → 895.24] And we kind of looked at their formula, and we went, well, that's not really going to work
[895.24 → 900.24] for us anyway because it was very hard sell, and it was very like, whoa, check this out.
[900.24 → 901.24] You got this iPhone.
[901.24 → 902.24] It's perfect.
[902.24 → 905.24] It's cool, and it's $149.99.
[905.24 → 910.24] I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but I almost never talk about prices in my videos
[910.24 → 915.24] because I want the point of my video to be, this is the hat, this is what's good about it.
[915.24 → 918.24] These are some of the things that I don't think are that great about it.
[918.24 → 921.24] And I leave it to you to decide.
[921.24 → 924.24] You go find out how much it costs, and you decide if that's worth it to you.
[924.24 → 928.24] I just want you to understand what it is and what it's about, and then you go make your own
[928.24 → 931.24] decision because I'm not here to sell it to you.
[931.24 → 937.24] So that was my philosophy coming into it and because that worked, the project continued
[937.24 → 943.24] and we got more resources over time and I started to have a lot of fun with it.
[943.24 → 946.24] So I started to try to dedicate more time to it.
[946.24 → 952.24] And, you know, sometimes you don't know exactly what you're creating at the time that you're creating it
[952.24 → 957.24] and it just sort of snowballs out of control and there's almost nothing you can do to stop it.
[957.24 → 959.24] And that's what Tech Tips really ended up being.
[959.24 → 964.24] I mean, if you look back at that first video, which is the Sunbeam Tunic Tower, it's terrible.
[964.24 → 965.24] It's just absolutely terrible.
[965.24 → 971.24] And looking at that, I never would have imagined that we'd go to the point where Linus Tech Tips
[971.24 → 977.24] is close to 200,000 subscribers and NCI Tech Tips is going to be hitting the 150K subscriber
[977.24 → 978.24] marks soon, which is enormous.
[978.24 → 984.24] I mean, I looked at guys with 100,000 subscribers back then and I kind of went, whoa, how do you do
[984.24 → 985.24] that?
[985.24 → 989.24] And it turns out the answer is you just got to keep hammering away at it persistently.
[989.24 → 991.24] I mean, we've been at it five years now.
[991.24 → 992.24] It's not going to happen overnight.
[992.24 → 997.24] I mean, I think people start YouTube channels, and they think, oh, yeah, if I just create this great content,
[997.24 → 999.24] people will just come, and they'll watch it.
[999.24 → 1001.24] And it used to be more true even than it is now.
[1001.24 → 1004.24] Now it's almost impossible to get noticed on YouTube.
[1004.24 → 1008.24] People message me all the time asking me, how do I get started doing what you're doing?
[1008.24 → 1015.24] And so number one, I don't really have any incentive to give you the user's guide on how to do what I'm doing
[1015.24 → 1017.24] because then you'd be a direct competitor to what I'm doing.
[1017.24 → 1019.24] So there's that.
[1019.24 → 1028.24] But even if I did want to help you, I don't know that I could because you have to find your own way of doing things.
[1028.24 → 1037.24] If you try to do things the same as someone else who's already, like if I tried to do a funny spin on the latest news,
[1037.24 → 1042.24] I'd get destroyed by Sexy Phil because he's already been doing it all this time.
[1042.24 → 1043.24] He's got all this momentum.
[1043.24 → 1047.24] Nobody needs my channel about that unless I bring something really new and different to the table.
[1047.24 → 1050.24] So I think I sort of went off on a tangent there.
[1050.24 → 1053.24] But let's get to the next question from C Cipher.
[1053.24 → 1057.24] Do you think that liquid cooling solutions are better than air cooling solutions
[1057.24 → 1060.24] or do the aesthetics of liquid cooling outweigh its cons?
[1060.24 → 1066.24] Now I wasn't quite sure if I understood this question, but yes, liquid cooling solutions are better than air cooling solutions.
[1066.24 → 1069.24] Except for the fact that they do cost more money.
[1069.24 → 1075.24] These pre-done liquid cooling solutions in the single radiator form factor, honestly, other than aesthetics,
[1075.24 → 1078.24] are not that compelling compared to air cooling.
[1078.24 → 1088.24] You're probably better off with a Noctua and HD 14 or something like a Therm alright Silver Arrow versus using one of those single rad ones.
[1088.24 → 1091.24] But when you get up to something like an H100 or a custom loop,
[1091.24 → 1097.24] it will definitely leave behind the performance of an air cooling solution, especially when you're overclocking.
[1097.24 → 1101.24] Something that even Corsair doesn't communicate very well about the H100
[1101.24 → 1107.24] because they've got like performance metrics on the side of the box that go like air cooling this and H100 that.
[1107.24 → 1111.24] Unfortunately, they're using a stock CPU, or it's that stock voltage or something.
[1111.24 → 1116.24] The H100 is way better than is advertised once you start overclocking.
[1116.24 → 1125.24] It'll destroy any air cooling solution once you really start to pump the heat into it because water is so much more efficient at removing heat from the CPU.
[1125.24 → 1129.24] Ahem, from TMPMF, MF.
[1129.24 → 1133.24] OK. I built a computer with a high processor load between 40 and 80 percent.
[1133.24 → 1136.24] OK. This thing was heating up between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius.
[1136.24 → 1139.24] The PC is running 24-7 at those loads.
[1139.24 → 1142.24] I bought a liquid cooling kit and dropped it in.
[1142.24 → 1144.24] The CPU temperature dropped to 40 degrees Celsius.
[1144.24 → 1150.24] The interesting thing is that the copper plate of the cooling heat sink that touches the CPU top had a fairly rough surface.
[1150.24 → 1154.24] Had I used progressively finer lapping paper, I could have improved the heat dissipation even more.
[1154.24 → 1168.24] That is actually a common misconception that it is necessary to lap CPU contact surfaces that look like they have machining marks in them.
[1168.24 → 1181.24] In fact, it's far more important to have a flat or slightly convex surface versus having the most shiny surface because those marks are from machining the base.
[1181.24 → 1184.24] That means it's flat.
[1184.24 → 1190.24] Whereas if you lap it and you accidentally, this happens a lot of the time, you accidentally take off too much from the middle as you go back and forth, back and forth,
[1190.24 → 1194.24] you can actually end up with worse contact even though it looks like a mirror finish.
[1194.24 → 1196.24] So something to be aware of.
[1196.24 → 1202.24] From InMoneyWeTrust, it's Linus, long time watcher, two things.
[1202.24 → 1209.24] One of his questions was dumb, so the question I kept was, your favourite product type to unbox?
[1209.24 → 1210.24] It really depends.
[1210.24 → 1219.24] I think cases are one of the more interesting unboxing because I can really sort of, I can demo the product in a way that can't really be done with pictures or can be done,
[1219.24 → 1222.24] but sort of is more time-consuming than watching a video.
[1222.24 → 1226.24] But the things that I really get most excited about are probably still video cards.
[1226.24 → 1237.24] I mean, I don't have as much time for games as I'd like to anymore, but I'm still, you know, I'm a gamer at heart and I wish I did, so I still drool over the latest video cards.
[1237.24 → 1239.24] I also love new CPU architectures.
[1239.24 → 1245.24] I love doing overclocking videos because even though it's a lot of work that goes into sort of learning the ins and outs,
[1245.24 → 1254.24] or it used to be more work than it is now, nowadays, it's so easy to overclock, but, you know, learning how to overclock this new platform and then educating others,
[1254.24 → 1259.24] I want people to get more for their money, like the way that that's what got me so excited about computers.
[1259.24 → 1267.24] It's also like, oh, wow, I can buy a 2,500 plus, and then I can like overclock it to a 3,200 plus and no application will ever know the difference.
[1267.24 → 1269.24] Holy smokes, why isn't everyone doing this?
[1269.24 → 1274.24] And so I want everyone to have that same experience as me.
[1274.24 → 1279.24] Ah, from Kent Winger.
[1279.24 → 1285.24] There are a lot of mechanical keyboards out there, but from personal experience it seems hard to find the perfect match.
[1285.24 → 1290.24] Specific MX switches, media keys, key layouts, wrist rests, and LED lighting are all things to consider.
[1290.24 → 1294.24] Do you think that with the extra attention that it seems mechanical keyboards have gotten recently,
[1294.24 → 1297.24] that the market for the product will increase with more options available?
[1297.24 → 1304.24] The unfortunate answer, I think, is no, because mechanical keyboards are so much more expensive than membrane keyboards.
[1304.24 → 1310.24] And until people, okay, number one is that people who don't type well will never be able to tell the difference.
[1310.24 → 1316.24] And number two is that even for people who type well, until they really sit down and spend some time with a mechanical keyboard,
[1316.24 → 1318.24] a lot of them don't really see the value of it.
[1318.24 → 1326.24] Now, older generation people who, you know, started using computers with Model M's when they all came with really high quality mechanical key switches,
[1326.24 → 1328.24] will know that that's better.
[1328.24 → 1335.24] But most of the sort of, you know, sorry, sorry kids today, but most of the kids today have probably never touched one,
[1335.24 → 1340.24] unless they have like a keyboard enthusiast friend or something like that who gets them into it.
[1340.24 → 1346.24] So, without that, without that pre-existing knowledge that mechanical keyboards are inherently better, I think, if anything,
[1346.24 → 1349.24] because of the cost, they're going to remain a niche item.
[1349.24 → 1350.24] And we already have a lot of options.
[1350.24 → 1352.24] I mean, you want macro keys, get a Corsair.
[1352.24 → 1358.24] You want LED lighting, get a Leonid or a backlit Ducky or something like that, Corsair.
[1358.24 → 1359.24] We have tons of options.
[1359.24 → 1361.24] I don't really think we need that much more.
[1361.24 → 1362.24] Sorry, I feel like an itch here.
[1362.24 → 1363.24] Looks terrible, doesn't it?
[1363.24 → 1365.24] It's like that Seinfeld episode.
[1365.24 → 1368.24] No, no, it was a scratch, not a pick.
[1368.24 → 1369.24] No pick.
[1369.24 → 1370.24] Love Seinfeld.
[1370.24 → 1373.24] I saw him live in Vancouver, actually.
[1373.24 → 1377.24] What was, wow, it must have been like a year and a half ago, two years ago.
[1377.24 → 1379.24] He was fantastic.
[1379.24 → 1383.24] He wasn't that great, but I just, I love his humour, so I enjoyed it.
[1383.24 → 1386.24] The review in the local paper wasn't that great.
[1386.24 → 1392.24] In your opinion, does adding a sound card and a high-quality headset add to the immersion of games?
[1392.24 → 1398.24] I'm looking at a Sennheiser 350 and an Asus Phoebus, Phobos, Phoebus, some moon, I don't know, I don't remember how to pronounce it.
[1398.24 → 1404.24] Yes, I personally don't like the Sennheiser PC350 that much.
[1404.24 → 1407.24] I'm more of a Steel Series 7H kind of guy.
[1407.24 → 1408.24] I think it sounds better.
[1408.24 → 1410.24] I think it's more comfortable.
[1410.24 → 1416.24] If not a 7H, then something like a Corsair Vengeance 2000 is actually surprisingly good, given that it's wireless.
[1416.24 → 1427.24] And then there's always the option, I mean, this is how I used to game, is I actually had this exact mic hanging around my neck, and then I was using my Sennheiser HD555s.
[1427.24 → 1429.24] And that's an option as well.
[1429.24 → 1438.24] So you can get a real pair of like real good quality headphones and then just a headset mic, you know, or like a desktop mic hanging off your desk and that's a good solution.
[1438.24 → 1440.24] The Asus Phoebus actually is not that great of a value.
[1440.24 → 1448.24] Yeah, it's an DOG product, but you're probably better off with a Sonar STX because it actually uses higher quality components.
[1448.24 → 1454.24] So check out the Hardware Canucks review of the Phoebus if you want to learn more, HardwareCanucks.com.
[1454.24 → 1457.24] What is the main thing that keeps you making new videos?
[1457.24 → 1459.24] Well, I enjoy it for one thing.
[1459.24 → 1472.24] I mean, if I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't be up at, you know, 10.30 at night my time making a video for you guys because I can tell you right now, it's not like it's lucrative.
[1472.24 → 1474.24] I really enjoy the product.
[1474.24 → 1483.24] I mean, that was one of the reasons I really got into Tech Tips was I loved having my hands on and testing and enjoying the latest hardware before anyone else had access to it.
[1483.24 → 1492.24] So, I mean, I was one of the first people to be holding an Intel Extreme Edition on the LGA 1366 platform and that kind of thing is very exciting for me.
[1492.24 → 1494.24] So, I'm still passionate about it.
[1494.24 → 1496.24] I'm passionate about different things these days.
[1496.24 → 1505.24] Like, I'm way more into networking and storage than I used to be, especially because my storage needs are so much more than they were, you know, three, four, five years ago.
[1505.24 → 1516.24] I mean, I archive so much 1080p footage and I do so much video editing over my network that all of a sudden I just have these needs that I didn't have before.
[1516.24 → 1522.24] So, I'm still excited about computer hardware but just different aspects of it.
[1522.24 → 1534.24] From XYtrouble07, Linus, what is truly beneficial in having server hardware-based computers and having a 2011 socket system with two Leon chips, 64 gigs of RAM,
[1534.24 → 1540.24] four-way SLR quad crossfire in Windows 7 instead of Windows Server, what are the disadvantages and advantages of this?
[1540.24 → 1543.24] Server hardware is not different from desktop hardware.
[1543.24 → 1549.24] Eons are the same as Core i's and server motherboards are not better than desktop motherboards.
[1549.24 → 1552.24] In fact, in some ways they're worse because you can't even overclock.
[1552.24 → 1559.24] Most of your desktop applications are not going to benefit from more than even three, two to three cores these days.
[1559.24 → 1570.24] So, if you're getting up to four and six cores plus hyper-threading, I would say for a desktop there's this much benefit to using server-level hardware other than if you just want to spend a lot more money.
[1570.24 → 1576.24] That hardware is for servers and workstations, not for average users and gamers.
[1576.24 → 1582.24] From Lame dog, so what do you do with the products you get unboxed? Do you trash them? No.
[1582.24 → 1589.24] Keep them? Sometimes. Redox them and sell them as unused? No, that doesn't happen.
[1589.24 → 1593.24] Or do you redox them and sell them as refurbished? That does happen from time to time.
[1593.24 → 1596.24] So, there. I hope that answers your question.
[1596.24 → 1601.24] Here are a few questions I would like to ask. Says 191X7.
[1601.24 → 1606.24] What's your opinion on buying a 23-inch 3D120Hz TN panel?
[1606.24 → 1611.24] So that is like the lower colour depth but higher response time, or lower response time,
[1611.24 → 1621.24] higher, faster response panel, a 1080p monitor versus an IPS or PLS 24-inch 1920x1200.
[1621.24 → 1627.24] Okay, well that doesn't make a difference. That small difference in resolution doesn't make a difference.
[1627.24 → 1632.24] So basically what he's asking is what's better, having better colour depth and better viewing angle,
[1632.24 → 1637.24] or having faster pixel response times and the potential for 3D technology?
[1637.24 → 1641.24] Well, it comes down to what you want. Do you want 3D? Then you get a TN,
[1641.24 → 1644.24] because there's no non-TN 3D vision-ready monitors.
[1644.24 → 1650.24] You want better colour accuracy, better colour depth? Then get a PLS and IPV.
[1650.24 → 1655.24] Or an MVA or PVA. So that comes down to the individual user.
[1655.24 → 1661.24] Personally, I use a 30-inch. I use a 30-inch VA panel, and I'm very happy with that.
[1661.24 → 1664.24] I have no desire to go 3D for my daily driver machine.
[1664.24 → 1668.24] I find that the difference in colour depth is just not worth it for me.
[1668.24 → 1671.24] But again, it comes down to the individual user. You guys have to make that choice.
[1671.24 → 1675.24] I can't make it for you. And then he had a follow-up question.
[1675.24 → 1680.24] Would you go for a lower capacity, let's say 64-gig SSD with higher quality flash,
[1680.24 → 1685.24] or a higher capacity async flash drive? Because, and his example is 90 gigs.
[1685.24 → 1688.24] Personally, it depends on the capacities you're looking at.
[1688.24 → 1696.24] If you're looking at like 256 versus 512, then I'd say maybe go with a good quality drive,
[1696.24 → 1701.24] because 256 is already a lot of storage, and the price delta is going to be pretty big.
[1701.24 → 1707.24] If you're looking at like a 60 versus a 90, go with the 90, because 60 is just not enough for anything these days.
[1707.24 → 1712.24] When will you go on the MOD, the Keyboard, Mouse or Die podcast?
[1712.24 → 1717.24] I'm going to get in touch with John, and hopefully sometime in Q4.
[1717.24 → 1721.24] But there's going to be some big announcements coming up over the next couple of months,
[1721.24 → 1723.24] and I'll keep you guys posted.
[1723.24 → 1726.24] But it won't be until after the big announcement.
[1726.24 → 1728.24] So I'm going to go back to Twitter for a little bit here.
[1728.24 → 1730.24] Sorry to have abandoned you guys on Twitter.
[1730.24 → 1731.24] I'm not trying to do that.
[1731.24 → 1735.24] It's just I want to get through all these questions, and we're already half an hour in.
[1735.24 → 1740.24] And I really don't want to go longer than about an hour tonight, because it will already be 11 PM my time.
[1740.24 → 1742.24] So let's do some Twitter questions.
[1742.24 → 1746.24] Arms says, what do you think of the NVIDIA 9800 GT 1 gig?
[1746.24 → 1749.24] I wish I'd read that question before I'd read it out and promised I'd answer it,
[1749.24 → 1752.24] because it's sort of a random question.
[1752.24 → 1753.24] What do I think of it?
[1753.24 → 1754.24] I think it's a video card.
[1754.24 → 1755.24] I think it's an old video card.
[1755.24 → 1759.24] I think it is DirectX 10 ready.
[1759.24 → 1761.24] I don't know what you want me to say about it.
[1761.24 → 1765.24] You can easily find benchmarks of that card, and then you'll know what it is.
[1765.24 → 1767.24] Let's see, hold on.
[1767.24 → 1772.24] I'm going to just read a couple here so that I don't read out any other ones that are sort of random.
[1772.24 → 1779.24] David Print asks, hey Linus, do you know when the NCI US store will offer pre-built systems like on the NCIX.ca site?
[1779.24 → 1781.24] It's coming at some point.
[1781.24 → 1787.24] I think there are some sorts of pricing challenges to do with doing it, as well as the logistics.
[1787.24 → 1790.24] We don't have an assembly department in our US warehouse.
[1790.24 → 1799.24] However, if you email pc at NCIX.com, the crazy Russian himself will personally arrange for US customers to be able to buy a system,
[1799.24 → 1801.24] will ship it to you directly from Canada.
[1801.24 → 1802.24] We don't have to do that.
[1802.24 → 1804.24] It's actually not that much more expensive.
[1804.24 → 1807.24] So if you want an NCI PC, you can get one.
[1807.24 → 1808.24] No problem.
[1808.24 → 1815.24] I'm building an IT PC inside an ammo box and using a Corsair H80.
[1815.24 → 1816.24] Is it possible to shorten the tube?
[1816.24 → 1817.24] It's in Zac.
[1817.24 → 1820.24] Zac, the answer is yes, but it's more work than it's worth.
[1820.24 → 1824.24] Get yourself a custom loop if you want to do a truly custom project.
[1824.24 → 1833.24] What you'd have to do is you'd have to cut them off, and then you'd have to, I don't know the way that they fill the cool-lit ones,
[1833.24 → 1838.24] but I know on the old Acetic ones what you had to do is you actually had to disassemble the pump unit from the baseplate,
[1838.24 → 1843.24] and then you had to fill it like that, and then put the baseplate on and hope you didn't have too much air stuck inside,
[1843.24 → 1845.24] and that was the only way to put in after market tubes.
[1845.24 → 1850.24] I remember because I wanted to swap out the tubes with some UV blue ones for a build I was doing,
[1850.24 → 1853.24] it ended up being way more trouble than it's worth.
[1853.24 → 1856.24] Just like way more trouble than it's worth.
[1856.24 → 1860.24] Linus, should I get a Racer Naga Epic or Leonid 5000?
[1860.24 → 1862.24] I'm only going to play FPS games.
[1862.24 → 1865.24] I love the sensor in the Naga, to be perfectly honest.
[1865.24 → 1870.24] The Leonid 5000 is perfect too, I really like it, but it's not my favourite.
[1870.24 → 1876.24] I don't like the Surface compatibility, at least using the firmware on the one that I have, it's quite an old sample,
[1876.24 → 1879.24] but I love the Naga.
[1879.24 → 1883.24] The only thing I don't like about the Naga is it's quite small, and I have small hands already,
[1883.24 → 1888.24] so unless you've actually tried it in person, then you might want to make sure that you have a chance to actually touch one.
[1888.24 → 1894.24] I have a Logitech G600, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but I'm really excited about that one,
[1894.24 → 1897.24] because I love the G9 laser that I use.
[1897.24 → 1903.24] I love the sensor on the G9, and I'm hoping that they're using something as good or better in the G600.
[1903.24 → 1909.24] And those buttons don't really get in your way the way that they do on the Naga, as well as some of the Steel Series MMO mice,
[1909.24 → 1911.24] and it's a much nicer handshake.
[1911.24 → 1913.24] The ergonomics are outstanding.
[1913.24 → 1915.24] So consider the G600.
[1915.24 → 1921.24] Would you update from an i7-2600K to a 3770K?
[1921.24 → 1923.24] I think the simple answer is no.
[1923.24 → 1928.24] They're very close in terms of performance once you overclock them both to the max.
[1928.24 → 1930.24] Will MIX ever ship computers to the USA?
[1930.24 → 1932.24] Okay, we covered that.
[1932.24 → 1934.24] Hmm.
[1934.24 → 1940.24] Someone's asking if I considered the new MSI Z77 board for my personal build.
[1940.24 → 1942.24] No, I'm using X79.
[1942.24 → 1947.24] I'm not using LGA 1155, although, actually, I'm very excited about this.
[1947.24 → 1948.24] Not this.
[1948.24 → 1949.24] Sorry.
[1949.24 → 1950.24] Move that out of the way.
[1950.24 → 1951.24] This.
[1951.24 → 1952.24] Ah!
[1952.24 → 1959.24] This just arrived, and they have completely redone the way that they're doing, the way that
[1959.24 → 1965.24] they've completely redone their VRM design on this board, compared to their previous
[1965.24 → 1975.24] that there is no, I'm hoping that there's no coil line.
[1975.24 → 1977.24] The colour scheme of the board is excellent.
[1977.24 → 1978.24] You know, the quality is excellent.
[1978.24 → 1983.24] I'll use anything from the big three, ASUS Gigabyte MSI, and I'm super stoked to try that
[1983.24 → 1987.24] one, and hopefully I'll have a real update for you guys soon, because I don't want to start
[1987.24 → 1991.24] reeling holes in the case, so I can't get it painted because I haven't done the holes
[1991.24 → 1995.24] yet, and I don't want to start reeling holes in the case until I've actually decided on a
[1995.24 → 1997.24] board, so, yes.
[1997.24 → 2002.24] The project's been stalled, but hopefully it's going to be back on track pretty soon here.
[2002.24 → 2004.24] Which 660 Ti would you recommend?
[2004.24 → 2005.24] MSI Power Edition.
[2005.24 → 2006.24] Done.
[2006.24 → 2007.24] No-brainer.
[2007.24 → 2014.24] Ah, would you, something, new, new, new, new.
[2014.24 → 2020.24] What's your thought on the Sabertoothed 990FX versus the Crosshair 5 formula?
[2020.24 → 2024.24] I've never used the 990FX, but I can tell you guys the Crosshair 5 is an outstanding board,
[2024.24 → 2028.24] way better than the 990FX boards I've used from the other manufacturers.
[2028.24 → 2033.24] ASUS really set themselves apart on their 990FX implementations.
[2033.24 → 2037.24] But sorry, I can't really comment on the Sabertoothed because I haven't used it.
[2037.24 → 2043.24] Oh, Bradley, Bradley writes in, your test on seeing hertz, so seeing the refresh rate
[2043.24 → 2045.24] of the monitor didn't seem fair.
[2045.24 → 2047.24] The game was only outputting about 70 FPS.
[2047.24 → 2050.24] If you got 120 FPS, wouldn't it be a better test?
[2050.24 → 2054.24] Bradley, I can tell you right now from how many times I've run that benchmark, there are
[2054.24 → 2059.24] plenty of times in that bench when it's well over 60 FPS.
[2059.24 → 2062.24] So, don't worry about it, it's all good.
[2062.24 → 2067.24] However, as for whether it's fair or not, I wasn't really going for fairness.
[2067.24 → 2075.24] I was going for, the point was, is this something that is immediately obvious, or is this not
[2075.24 → 2077.24] something that's immediately obvious?
[2077.24 → 2082.24] And I think what we discovered is that for the average gamer, it's not immediately obvious
[2082.24 → 2087.24] if they don't have any experience already with 120 hertz.
[2087.24 → 2091.24] And I sure hope this livestream's still going, because mine sort of has lagged out for a second here,
[2091.24 → 2095.24] but no one's complained yet, so hopefully we're all right.
[2095.24 → 2101.24] Um, why not? I have a something, yeah, no, not a good question.
[2101.24 → 2106.24] Thoughts about carbon chips? I'm not an engineer, I'm sorry.
[2106.24 → 2111.24] No offence, here's a good one. MC Donald, no offence, but does it annoy you that everyone
[2111.24 → 2115.24] thinks you're gay? Um, no, not at all. I think it's hilarious.
[2115.24 → 2121.24] And in fact, for years, I intentionally went out of my way to never address it at all,
[2121.24 → 2124.24] because it just was way too amusing.
[2124.24 → 2129.24] And honestly, from a sheer YouTuber perspective, anything that generates comments and discussion
[2129.24 → 2132.24] on my videos is, like, thumbs up.
[2132.24 → 2137.24] So if people want to sit and have, like, a long discussion about how I'm gay or not gay,
[2137.24 → 2143.24] like, great, post comments on the video, fantastic, thumbs up, thank you for driving up my YouTube
[2143.24 → 2147.24] search rankings with your totally irrelevant comment. Yay.
[2147.24 → 2154.24] Uh, would you recommend the mechanical keyboard over Logitech G19? Yes.
[2154.24 → 2160.24] New MacBook Pro or Racer Blade? MacBook Pro. Install Windows on it.
[2160.24 → 2166.24] Uh, what else we got here? What's better in your opinion? The 800D or Cosmos 2 for water cooling?
[2166.24 → 2172.24] 800D, hands down. Cosmos 2 is big, but it's actually not particularly well laid out in terms of water cooling.
[2172.24 → 2175.24] The 800D is an excellent, well-thought-out case.
[2175.24 → 2180.24] However, there's already rumours of a 900D on the horizon, so you might want to just sort of hold your horses for a little bit
[2180.24 → 2183.24] and wait and see what happens with that.
[2183.24 → 2190.24] And you might think a 360 rad's enough for you, but what you'll discover is that water cooling is basically like injecting drugs into your veins,
[2190.24 → 2194.24] and you'll find that what once was enough is quickly not enough anymore.
[2194.24 → 2199.24] Reading, reading, reading.
[2199.24 → 2201.24] Will you benchmark Max Payne 3 and Sleeping Dogs?
[2201.24 → 2204.24] You know what, I don't have a copy of Max Payne 3, so I don't really have any intention of doing it.
[2204.24 → 2208.24] Sleeping Dogs I might. I just got a copy today. So if I find some time, then I will.
[2208.24 → 2214.24] But I've got a lot of backlog right now. I've actually got about 15 videos shot, not yet uploaded,
[2214.24 → 2216.24] because I only do one video per day.
[2216.24 → 2221.24] And then I've also got a bunch of stuff that I've committed to the manufacturers to produce.
[2221.24 → 2224.24] Like for example, this I'm really excited about.
[2224.24 → 2231.24] Western Digital managed to get me my hands on this Synology NAS, and four of their new RED drives.
[2231.24 → 2235.24] So we're going to be doing a great episode about their RED, RAID and NAS edition drives,
[2235.24 → 2238.24] and the benefits that they have over their regular drives.
[2238.24 → 2240.24] I mean, I can give you guys a quick summary.
[2240.24 → 2245.24] And the summary is they're using enterprise level validated components,
[2245.24 → 2249.24] because there's a binning process for platters and spindles and hard drives,
[2249.24 → 2253.24] in much the same way that there's a binning process for memory or CPUs or anything else.
[2253.24 → 2257.24] And all they're doing is they are reducing the spindle speed,
[2257.24 → 2260.24] so they're not as fast as their RE series drives.
[2260.24 → 2261.24] They're true enterprise drives.
[2261.24 → 2265.24] But they are operating under a very strict tolerance in terms of their vibrations,
[2265.24 → 2267.24] so they're excellent for RAID operation.
[2267.24 → 2271.24] And honestly, they're fast enough for any NAS out there anyway,
[2271.24 → 2275.24] because you're going to be bottlenecked by the chipset in these inexpensive enclosures,
[2275.24 → 2279.24] or the gigabit Ethernet connection long before you're going to be bottlenecked
[2279.24 → 2284.24] by the performance of the drives themselves if you're running in some kind of RAID.
[2284.24 → 2287.24] By the way, feel free to let me know if this is like totally boring and not interesting,
[2287.24 → 2291.24] because I'm still pretty new to this whole live stream thing.
[2291.24 → 2293.24] So I hope you guys like the way I'm managing questions.
[2293.24 → 2296.24] What I'll probably do is instead of posting an AMA on Reddit next time,
[2296.24 → 2298.24] I'll just post in the PC section.
[2298.24 → 2301.24] And I do want to continue to take Twitter questions.
[2301.24 → 2305.24] It's easier to manage Twitter now that I'm using the browser-based one
[2305.24 → 2307.24] versus trying to do it on my phone,
[2307.24 → 2311.24] because that's how quickly they're coming in, and it's really, really hard to keep up.
[2311.24 → 2315.24] What's your opinion on the Zeeman 9900 CPU cooler?
[2315.24 → 2317.24] Oh man, it is really hard to install.
[2317.24 → 2321.24] It took me and Slick to get that thing installed on a motherboard.
[2321.24 → 2323.24] So it looks great.
[2323.24 → 2327.24] It cools well, but oh man, get something easier to install.
[2327.24 → 2329.24] Noctua is awesome for that.
[2329.24 → 2332.24] You can always replace the fans on a Noctua if you don't like the colour.
[2334.24 → 2338.24] How long do you think until we see $600 to $800 4K monitors?
[2338.24 → 2341.24] No time frame can be soon enough for me.
[2341.24 → 2344.24] I'm very excited about 4K, but unfortunately,
[2344.24 → 2347.24] my crystal ball is not functioning right now,
[2347.24 → 2349.24] so I can't really speculate on that.
[2349.24 → 2352.24] Does a good motherboard make a big difference in gaming?
[2352.24 → 2353.24] No.
[2353.24 → 2354.24] No.
[2354.24 → 2355.24] What do you want me to say?
[2355.24 → 2357.24] It doesn't make any performance difference these days.
[2357.24 → 2360.24] What it comes down to is the features that it has.
[2360.24 → 2362.24] Well, the features that it has.
[2362.24 → 2364.24] Yes, it might last longer.
[2364.24 → 2365.24] Yes, it might be more stable.
[2365.24 → 2367.24] But what you really want to look for is, you know,
[2367.24 → 2370.24] hey, does it come with like a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi adapter?
[2370.24 → 2374.24] Does it have, you know, SAS connectors on it, which is pretty cool?
[2374.24 → 2377.24] Does it support things like quickly charging your iPad
[2377.24 → 2379.24] when you plug it into the front panel ports?
[2379.24 → 2384.24] Does it have support for, you know, three-way SLI if you ever plan to use,
[2384.24 → 2385.24] multiple graphics cards?
[2385.24 → 2387.24] You want to look for the things that matter to you.
[2387.24 → 2391.24] Does it have high-end onboard audio, like something like a Maximus 5 formula?
[2391.24 → 2394.24] Those are the things to really look for when you're choosing a high-end motherboard.
[2394.24 → 2398.24] Me, I pick a motherboard based on is it made by one of the big three manufacturers,
[2398.24 → 2400.24] Asus MSI Gigabyte?
[2400.24 → 2403.24] And does it like match my colour scheme and not make annoying noises?
[2403.24 → 2405.24] So everyone has their own criteria.
[2405.24 → 2408.24] Should I get an SSD or stick with my Velociraptor?
[2408.24 → 2409.24] Get an SSD.
[2409.24 → 2413.24] The answer to anyone who doesn't have an SSD already is got an SSD.
[2413.24 → 2417.24] People who say that SSDs don't make an enormous difference to the performance of your PC
[2417.24 → 2425.24] have never used an SSD, or they're blind or incapable of, I don't know, something.
[2425.24 → 2432.24] They're not paying attention because SSD is the biggest upgrade that you can make to your PC today.
[2432.24 → 2436.24] Upgrading your CPU is going to do almost nothing for the day-to-day usage of your computer
[2436.24 → 2439.24] versus upgrading from a hard drive to an SSD.
[2439.24 → 2442.24] It's like when we went from single core to dual-core.
[2442.24 → 2444.24] Dual core to quad-core was no big deal.
[2444.24 → 2445.24] You can hardly tell the difference.
[2445.24 → 2448.24] Whereas single core to dual-core was amazing.
[2448.24 → 2454.24] I spent $700 on an Athlon 64 X2 4400 plus, and it was worth every penny.
[2454.24 → 2459.24] And I would do the same thing with SSD when it came out because that's how big of a difference it makes.
[2459.24 → 2468.24] Actually, that was the single most expensive component I ever spent my own hard-earned dollars on was that $700 CPU.
[2468.24 → 2474.24] Back on release day, I went to NCI Burnaby and I bought one from Xenon who still works there.
[2474.24 → 2475.24] He's awesome.
[2475.24 → 2476.24] Okay.
[2476.24 → 2478.24] Is your boss a cool guy?
[2478.24 → 2479.24] Yes.
[2479.24 → 2481.24] He is 100% a cool guy.
[2481.24 → 2486.24] I wouldn't still be at NCI if my boss wasn't outstanding.
[2486.24 → 2488.24] I mean, well, it's possible I would.
[2488.24 → 2491.24] I shouldn't say that, but he's one of the big reasons why I'm still there.
[2491.24 → 2493.24] He's just a fantastic boss.
[2493.24 → 2497.24] And I'm not saying that because he's watching.
[2497.24 → 2499.24] I truly believe that.
[2499.24 → 2503.24] So I've made my way through most of the tweets that I had seen.
[2503.24 → 2512.24] So I'm going to go back to some of the pre-scheduled questions from the Reddit thread.
[2512.24 → 2513.24] All right.
[2513.24 → 2516.24] Ivan Less says, Hi Linus.
[2516.24 → 2522.24] More and more people buy tablets and laptops these days paying more to have a mobile work platform.
[2522.24 → 2526.24] PC parts are getting more expensive with the release of cheap tablets and low-end laptops.
[2526.24 → 2531.24] I think what he means to say is relatively more expensive compared to these cheap solutions.
[2531.24 → 2537.24] Is PC in danger being used only by hardcore gamers and people who do programming, networking, and multimedia?
[2537.24 → 2542.24] Instead of going forward and producing cheaper, smaller hardware that is a lot stronger than the last generation was,
[2542.24 → 2548.24] are we going backwards to a time when a good all-around PC is going to be a luxury while consoles and tablets
[2548.24 → 2550.24] take over the everyday use of a PC?
[2550.24 → 2553.24] Gaming surfing, basic editing, and so on.
[2553.24 → 2556.24] Great question.
[2556.24 → 2558.24] Again, it comes down to the crystal ball thing,
[2558.24 → 2564.24] but I personally don't see tablets being able to realistically take over for PC anytime soon.
[2564.24 → 2569.24] I mean, any kind of two-part thing is never going to be a proper replacement for a PC.
[2569.24 → 2576.24] And the demand for a higher performance and more storage and all of these things that enthusiasts desire
[2576.24 → 2578.24] will always continue to trickle down.
[2578.24 → 2585.24] I think what we're really seeing more than a disappearance of the PC is a slowing of the advancement in the technology.
[2585.24 → 2589.24] So what that means is, is not that you're never going to have anything better to upgrade to
[2589.24 → 2595.24] or that you're not going to need a desktop PC anymore, but it means that you might not need to upgrade it as often anymore.
[2595.24 → 2601.24] So it used to be that every new generation that came out like six months after the previous one was like worth upgrading to,
[2601.24 → 2607.24] whereas now we're seeing more like smaller incremental improvements and people aren't upgrading all the time.
[2607.24 → 2612.24] Another thing too is for the everyday like average Joe user, you know, like my parents,
[2612.24 → 2618.24] my parents are running a Fennel X3 and that will be enough for them five years from now.
[2618.24 → 2620.24] They will never need more than that realistically.
[2620.24 → 2623.24] And I know this, you know, oh, Bill Gates, you'll never need more.
[2623.24 → 2626.24] That's a misquote by the way, but they really will.
[2626.24 → 2630.24] They really will never need more than that because they're not going to do more than word process.
[2630.24 → 2636.24] So that's what we've run into where the average user is not getting a huge benefit from a new PC anymore.
[2636.24 → 2641.24] So that's why we're seeing that slowing down, and we're seeing the market shrink a little bit.
[2641.24 → 2648.24] But a PC will still be useful for different things than a tablet.
[2648.24 → 2650.24] You'll never sit and do your homework at a tablet.
[2650.24 → 2655.24] I will peer into my crystal ball that I've referred to a lot already, and I will tell you that.
[2655.24 → 2660.24] It's not going to happen, but just because the screen's not big enough.
[2660.24 → 2662.24] I mean, look how cheap monitors are getting.
[2662.24 → 2665.24] You can get a 27-inch monitor for less than a couple of hundred bucks.
[2665.24 → 2672.24] You can get three of them, and you can have this enormous workspace that you will never have on your phone.
[2672.24 → 2673.24] It's not like so.
[2673.24 → 2676.24] So yes, the desktop will always have a place.
[2676.24 → 2680.24] Well, not always, but it will for a very, very long time.
[2680.24 → 2684.24] Part two of his question was, do you expect AMD's new CPU platform to be closer to Intel?
[2684.24 → 2686.24] I don't want them to be closer to Intel than Cinnamon Bulldozer were.
[2686.24 → 2688.24] And I can't really speculate on upcoming products.
[2688.24 → 2690.24] And the reality of it is I don't know yet.
[2690.24 → 2693.24] I don't have one yet.
[2693.24 → 2697.24] Kodak, Kodak, I don't know how to pronounce that.
[2697.24 → 2701.24] What were the specs of the first PC you built yourself and did anything go wrong?
[2701.24 → 2702.24] No, nothing went wrong.
[2702.24 → 2704.24] I had a very experienced guy helping me out.
[2704.24 → 2708.24] I had like a pro CS player named Kyle helping me.
[2708.24 → 2714.24] And he actually, it's funny because the first PC I built myself was actually built by someone else before I built it myself.
[2714.24 → 2718.24] So he and I did an exchange program thing to Quebec together.
[2718.24 → 2721.24] And he got me sold on this whole idea of building my own computer.
[2721.24 → 2727.24] And so when we got back, I used all the money I earned that summer to buy myself what I thought was a pretty wicked machine.
[2727.24 → 2731.24] So I got myself a 2500 plus, a Sol tech MRN2L.
[2731.24 → 2736.24] So this was like an onboard, but it had GeForce 4 onboard.
[2736.24 → 2737.24] So I figured it was pretty good.
[2737.24 → 2740.24] Okay. So onboard graphics, 512 legs of Samsung Ram.
[2740.24 → 2757.24] And I opted for the 80 gig drive with the 8 Meg cache versus the 120 gig drive with the 2 Meg cache because I was upgrading from like, oh man, it was something pathetic like a 6 gig drive or a 10 gig drive or something.
[2757.24 → 2759.24] So I figured, well, 80 gigs is a lot anyway.
[2759.24 → 2761.24] I want that extra performance from the extra cache.
[2761.24 → 2763.24] I picked myself up.
[2763.24 → 2766.24] I think it was like a BenQ CD burner.
[2766.24 → 2771.24] I got a lot of stuff.
[2771.24 → 2775.24] And it was all in an Aztec Land boy, the original Land boy with the Smart Blue power supply.
[2775.24 → 2776.24] So Kyle actually built the PC for me right in front of me.
[2776.24 → 2781.24] Then I took it, took it home, tore it completely apart, back to scratch, and then put it back together myself.
[2781.24 → 2787.24] So given I had watched an expert do it before I tried to do it myself, I didn't end up having any trouble.
[2787.24 → 2794.24] So if you guys want to take a similar approach, you can actually watch my PC build guide if you search for PC build guide on YouTube.
[2794.24 → 2797.24] And interview from Dec1 app, exciting stuff.
[2797.24 → 2798.24] It also did this right off of my car.
[2798.24 → 2799.24] It's fun.
[2799.24 → 2800.24] Into this KI item.
[2800.24 → 2803.24] So I think I realized I was extremely successful, and I haven't done nine things in this video.
[2803.24 → 2807.24] My vision was thanks to Professor KEM INE, the 2, five tengah�시e bill I've done.
[2807.24 → 2809.24] I'm telling you guys that I haven't done any b menus at any time.
[2809.24 → 2814.24] So when I was surprised I did something I realize with that.
[2814.24 → 2819.24] You mentioned MegaAsian convention and there was the low name of IoT when it had fun.
[2819.24 → 2846.44] much of your place to watch videos on their
[2846.44 → 2848.70] training because I'm in the same room.
[2849.24 → 2855.26] and I didn't and then I didn't change it so I've never really had any backlash on
[2855.26 → 2858.56] as for when I started realizing that your channels were heading for success
[2858.56 → 2863.10] I mean we've always seen growth like this in terms of you know subscribers and uh...
[2863.10 → 2865.42] and views and all that kind of stuff so
[2865.42 → 2868.82] um... you know we we we thought we were headed for success right from the beginning
[2868.82 → 2871.06] but we didn't ever really think it would be this big
[2871.06 → 2874.20] and that's me and cameraman we were the only ones on the project for you know
[2874.20 → 2876.56] three and a half years
[2876.56 → 2881.06] uh... john one six one four okay if you're on a budget what is the least
[2881.06 → 2884.34] important component in the gaming computer to save money on
[2884.34 → 2885.60] uh... your case
[2885.60 → 2889.06] so many people I see configuring eight hundred nine hundred dollar machine of a
[2889.06 → 2890.60] hundred and fifty dollar case
[2890.60 → 2893.44] just spending less than a thousand bucks get a cheap case doesn't help your
[2893.44 → 2895.96] performance
[2895.96 → 2899.90] uh... from f sixty-four looking beyond cloud computing what do you think is the
[2899.90 → 2903.44] next take and or talk in the computer industry
[2903.44 → 2905.08] uh...
[2905.08 → 2906.98] uh... take care from Jason
[2906.98 → 2911.78] in whatever NC USA is I'm sorry my uh... my u.s. geography is not very good
[2911.78 → 2913.20] uh...
[2913.20 → 2914.36] well right now
[2914.36 → 2917.02] i i think it's more of an evolution of cloud
[2917.02 → 2919.98] uh... compared to what we're seeing today like right now cloud
[2919.98 → 2920.90] computing
[2920.90 → 2923.80] isn't really even cloud computing its more like cloud storage
[2923.80 → 2926.36] uh... and that's where we're seeing most of the applications
[2926.36 → 2927.44] uh... in the cloud
[2927.44 → 2931.58] whereas I think cloud computing has yet to really take off where
[2931.58 → 2935.54] with things like uh... with things like online uh... on live
[2935.54 → 2937.92] with their game streaming uh...
[2937.92 → 2941.86] or you know things like I mean Netflix is sort of computing is a little bit of
[2941.86 → 2944.32] computing but again is mostly storage in
[2944.32 → 2946.22] and data distribution so I think
[2946.22 → 2947.48] uh...
[2947.48 → 2951.62] being able to use a thin client whether it's a console or whether it's a pc
[2951.62 → 2955.14] and have all the actual work being done in the cloud in some
[2955.14 → 2956.12] data
[2956.12 → 2960.22] farm somewhere with a billion in video GPU's and a whole lack lose Zion CPUs
[2960.22 → 2964.72] uh... is where we're really headed but before that can happen we're going to need
[2964.72 → 2969.50] to see a huge evolution in that network speeds so networking is really where
[2969.50 → 2974.28] the advancement needs to happen and that's that's fibre because that's the
[2974.28 → 2978.10] only wherever going to get latency is close to where they need to be to truly sit
[2978.10 → 2982.34] down and use a computer and feel like you're using a local machine, but you're
[2982.34 → 2987.18] actually not and especially in places like North America where the landmass is
[2987.18 → 2989.32] the landmass is so big
[2989.32 → 2990.40] uh...
[2990.40 → 2994.34] it'll be uh... and realistically it'll be decades before we get there
[2994.34 → 2998.62] uh... to the point where you know someone who lives in rural Alberta is
[2998.62 → 3002.62] going to be able to use cloud computing in any meaningful way we're still going to
[3002.62 → 3003.28] need
[3003.28 → 3007.40] local computing for a very long time whereas places like Japan
[3007.40 → 3011.10] I mean it could be around the corner because they're so dense so you can spend
[3011.10 → 3014.56] all this money on infrastructure, but you can actually reach like a boatload of
[3014.56 → 3015.42] people with it
[3015.42 → 3019.26] so becomes much more worthwhile than in the U.S. and Canada especially Canada
[3019.26 → 3023.48] where I don't know if you yank realize this but uh... Canada has fewer
[3023.48 → 3026.34] people living in it in the state of California
[3026.34 → 3030.18] is actually a significantly bigger land mass than the entire United States are
[3030.18 → 3031.56] population density is like
[3031.56 → 3047.44] n
[3047.44 → 3049.44] who
[3049.44 → 3054.00] great question because I don't actually get paid to endorse anything I get paid
[3054.00 → 3055.20] by NCI X
[3055.20 → 3058.20] who is partners with almost everybody
[3058.20 → 3061.82] so anyone can have a fair crack at tech tips I mean I don't you guys have
[3061.82 → 3062.60] noticed this
[3062.60 → 3065.74] but will look at a cease motherboards
[3065.74 → 3070.58] all the way down to Buffalo routers you know Buffalo is hardly the Susan
[3070.58 → 3073.76] routers you know that would be a Cisco or links is a dealing
[3073.76 → 3076.92] I'm so everybody has a fair crack at tech tips
[3076.92 → 3080.82] and what I usually do is I'll look at it, and I'll go okay
[3080.82 → 3083.74] on both this is a great example actually where
[3083.74 → 3087.18] WD asked me what nasty want to feature
[3087.18 → 3090.62] are with your WD red showcase so
[3090.62 → 3095.04] why am I doing a red showcase small because these drives are exciting in WD
[3095.04 → 3096.42] wants me to do a red showcase
[3096.42 → 3100.34] why am I using a Synology NAS because I picked a Synology NAS
[3100.34 → 3103.64] so I have a lot of influence in
[3103.64 → 3107.54] which components I'm showcasing because I can go to almost anyone and say okay
[3107.54 → 3108.96] look we want to showcase your part
[3108.96 → 3112.52] on can you support us, and it's not that often that someone turns around and says
[3112.52 → 3112.96] no
[3112.96 → 3116.40] so when you guys see that MSI gets a lot of love
[3116.40 → 3119.38] for their video cards on tech tips is a very good reason for that
[3119.38 → 3123.54] the video cards I get really excited about things like there for 60 cyclone back in
[3123.54 → 3124.04] the day
[3124.04 → 3127.90] or like their hockey dishing cards are the ones that are truly unique and truly
[3127.90 → 3130.08] different from what other people are doing that's why you
[3130.08 → 3135.84] don't actually see a lot of showcases for VGA for example because most of their
[3135.84 → 3136.52] cards are
[3136.52 → 3140.90] kinda reference on and now that they don't really have the lifetime warranty thing
[3140.90 → 3142.96] going on you know I'd rather talk about
[3142.96 → 3146.60] some I'd rather talk about something that I can talk about because I can only
[3146.60 → 3149.84] like motherboards especially are really hard now because
[3149.84 → 3153.86] they're often so similar unless there's something truly different about this one
[3153.86 → 3155.12] that I can really call out
[3155.12 → 3159.16] it's very difficult for me to stand there and talk for six to eight minutes about it
[3159.16 → 3163.72] I'll and fill in the time, so I'd like to, and I prefer to find things that I
[3163.72 → 3164.78] truly think are interesting
[3164.78 → 3168.98] so on the ultimate water cool build I used primarily swift tech
[3168.98 → 3171.72] partly because they were like look will help sponsor the episode
[3171.72 → 3175.66] and partly because I'm a swift tech fanboy you look at the parts I'm using in my
[3175.66 → 3176.28] machine
[3176.28 → 3180.60] I've got a swift tech Apple GHD gold-plated I bought and paid for that was
[3180.60 → 3183.78] totally my own money I've got arm
[3183.78 → 3189.40] I've got a swift tech water cool GTX 590 I've got a swift tech MCP 655 pump and
[3189.40 → 3192.24] I'm using I was using an MC res micro up till recently, and then I'm going to use
[3192.24 → 3193.40] the T virus so
[3193.40 → 3198.34] other than boutique II hardware like my T virus or my thick thermal chill PA 120
[3198.34 → 3200.40] point for my old school one
[3200.40 → 3203.34] down a bit of a swift tech fanboy so what do you want me to say
[3203.34 → 3208.34] okay moving right along let's do another page of these pre-done questions
[3208.34 → 3212.34] before we start to do a little bit more live stuff and hopefully you guys aren't
[3212.34 → 3213.34] bored
[3213.34 → 3216.34] what are my thoughts on steam is one tweet that just came through, and I have a
[3216.34 → 3219.96] full episode on NCI X tech tips about steam I think it's the best thing since
[3219.96 → 3225.34] like this flower jar that is like cow patterned so there you go I love steam
[3225.34 → 3230.34] is amazing and magical it's the best possible implementation of deep tech
[3230.34 → 3235.34] because it delivers compelling value to me as the user as opposed to just
[3235.34 → 3239.34] restricting the way I use the product I have no problem paying for stuff but if
[3239.34 → 3243.34] you DRM it in such a way that it makes it worse than if I pirated it then I get
[3243.34 → 3247.34] upset whereas if you DRM it in a way that makes my life better and easier like the
[3247.34 → 3253.34] way steam does then yay I didn't get my thumb in the right place yay at what point
[3253.34 → 3259.34] did manufacturer start sending review units to you, and I'm not going to be
[3259.34 → 3263.54] good then the affiliate sales Oliver wood is friendly to a developer
[3263.54 → 3266.72] content the software but just kind of getting his own brief
[3266.72 → 3272.06] in that appreciation for data management and the cost of data from fresh
[3272.06 → 3275.12] say that, and they'll use the software is on there in storage to very well
[3275.12 → 3275.34] fast that going into that summer jest
[3275.34 → 3278.64] and it doesn't like human creativity that and that is all right I think
[3278.64 → 3280.28] right now that I think it's very Indian I'Mei
[3280.28 → 3282.34] program you guys online I don't even say it's very valuable I think that the
[3282.34 → 3284.34] best I mean you are going to spend a salmon this year if you're asking
[3284.34 → 3288.34] aura if that like this is going to be just Hindi Cheapening
[3288.34 → 3292.62] uh... here's my value that I'm going to deliver you at least ten thousand or
[3292.62 → 3295.00] twenty thousand three thousand views
[3295.00 → 3298.20] and people are going to comment about your product they want to see that they
[3298.20 → 3299.58] want to know that's going to happen
[3299.58 → 3301.88] unless you can really demonstrate that
[3301.88 → 3303.78] tough luck chuck it's not going to happen
[3303.78 → 3306.74] uh... what advice can I get to a smaller site that may not have the advantage of
[3306.74 → 3307.88] review units
[3307.88 → 3310.56] uh... this is going to sound kind of rough but get a real job
[3310.56 → 3311.78] uh... because
[3311.78 → 3313.66] what I do on the video side
[3313.66 → 3317.36] is not a real job I have a nine-to-five I have
[3317.36 → 3318.68] uh...
[3318.68 → 3322.54] and a product manager at NC i x that's what I do for forty to fifty hours a
[3322.54 → 3323.18] week
[3323.18 → 3324.66] the video thing is
[3324.66 → 3327.26] above and beyond what I do for my real job
[3327.26 → 3329.66] so it's very
[3329.66 → 3332.36] there are very few locker gnomes out there
[3332.36 → 3333.32] my mic move
[3333.32 → 3335.80] uh... there are very few l rick
[3335.80 → 3339.84] l Rick's out there who are actually making a go of this
[3339.84 → 3340.78] uh...
[3340.78 → 3342.16] and there are
[3342.16 → 3346.12] thousands of people who want to be a computer hardware reviewer
[3346.12 → 3347.70] so unless you are
[3347.70 → 3351.22] one of the best you know
[3351.22 → 3353.66] maybe ten
[3353.66 → 3356.74] I'm sorry, but it's uh... it's not realistic and I've done not trying to
[3356.74 → 3358.16] crush your dreams or anything
[3358.16 → 3362.12] feel free to you know what a great example of someone who did kind of pull it off
[3362.12 → 3364.94] without much manufacturer support is pc was kid
[3364.94 → 3366.62] uh... you know i I'd
[3366.62 → 3369.78] I look up to what he did on his own all right because
[3369.78 → 3375.16] he mostly made his success through software tutorials which cost you
[3375.16 → 3379.68] once you just have to access the software and is also easier to solicit
[3379.68 → 3383.42] uh... samples for because software doesn't like physically cost anything
[3383.42 → 3385.86] whereas lake for a three hundred dollar motherboard
[3385.86 → 3389.06] realistically the bomb cost to gigabyte is somewhere in the hundred and fifty to
[3389.06 → 3391.04] two hundred and fifty dollar range
[3391.04 → 3393.96] like it actually cost them something they need to see an ally where software is
[3393.96 → 3394.70] easier
[3394.70 → 3399.42] uh... so that's one of the ways where you can really build up on audience without
[3399.42 → 3402.80] uh... without it being expensive to yourself are expensive to the uh... to
[3402.80 → 3405.38] the software developers
[3405.38 → 3407.00] from dr Kidd
[3407.00 → 3410.98] I'm wondering if I get the same GPU with more memory will I get more fps
[3410.98 → 3413.64] what are the advantages to more memory and GPU you know what i kind of
[3413.64 → 3415.98] covered this earlier in the live stream so I'm just going to do this really
[3415.98 → 3416.68] quick
[3416.68 → 3419.90] uh... unless you're pushing huge textures a huge resolution there's not much of
[3419.90 → 3420.86] an advantage
[3420.86 → 3422.34] and also
[3422.34 → 3423.40] if you're buying lake
[3423.40 → 3426.44] a GT six forty with four gigs of memory
[3426.44 → 3427.20] it will make
[3427.20 → 3429.12] zero difference
[3429.12 → 3432.80] because by the time you're pushing a resolution or a texture quality
[3432.80 → 3434.78] that you'd need that much memory for
[3434.78 → 3436.98] that GPU is choking, and you're running at
[3436.98 → 3439.22] one point five fps so
[3439.22 → 3442.34] uh... on very high-end graphics cards especially in surround
[3442.34 → 3445.30] or are very large monitor large uh...
[3445.30 → 3448.72] uh... high resolution monitors yes there's a benefit
[3448.72 → 3451.84] but uh... it won't matter unless you're running out of memory so a great way to
[3451.84 → 3454.52] find out if you benefit from more memories use afterburner
[3454.52 → 3457.94] to monitor your memory usage and see if you're maxing it out
[3457.94 → 3459.42] uh... minute
[3459.42 → 3460.68] sent in a question
[3460.68 → 3464.16] at what price does one start to get diminishing returns on the quality of a
[3464.16 → 3465.82] home-built gaming pc
[3465.82 → 3466.72] in other words
[3466.72 → 3469.60] say I'm putting aside a hundred dollars a week to save for the parts to build my
[3469.60 → 3470.48] own computer
[3470.48 → 3473.52] around what week do I start getting less improvement in performance than the
[3473.52 → 3475.64] previous weeks
[3475.64 → 3477.56] uh... I'd say you shouldn't be building a gaming computer for less than around
[3477.56 → 3480.52] nine hundred to eleven twelve hundred dollars
[3480.52 → 3482.64] below that you're getting diminishing
[3482.64 → 3484.28] returns on your investment
[3484.28 → 3487.58] because you're getting low quality staff for you getting stuff where if you spent
[3487.58 → 3490.66] twenty percent more you'd get forty percent more performance
[3490.66 → 3494.44] on and then above that you again start to get diminishing returns so
[3494.44 → 3498.20] uh... anything below, so six sixty ti for example is a perfect sweet spot
[3498.20 → 3501.96] anything below a six sixty ti is not as good of a value right now
[3501.96 → 3505.64] anything above the six sixty ti is not as good of a value you can find that sweet
[3505.64 → 3509.32] spot we actually have a great episode on I think shopping for video card
[3509.32 → 3513.08] uh... with the theme of finding the sweet spot on the NCI tech tips channel you
[3513.08 → 3516.60] guys want to subscribe to NCI tech tips you want to check out that episode
[3516.60 → 3521.36] because it really explains how you can shop around and search for benchmarks and
[3521.36 → 3525.74] comparisons and then shop by price and cross-reference those to find what is
[3525.74 → 3528.58] the best value for your dollar
[3528.58 → 3532.64] uh... super ninja with 3d gaming being relatively new and still making
[3532.64 → 3535.86] uh... lots of advancements would you recommend getting into it now or waiting
[3535.86 → 3537.12] until it's more stable
[3537.12 → 3540.00] honestly it's pretty stable NVIDIA's only done
[3540.00 → 3547.70] one revision since they released three division and honestly HDD is told
[3547.70 → 3549.24] that often just
[3549.24 → 3553.38] uh... that it was an awful experience even listed the better middleware of the
[3553.38 → 3554.98] two that work just
[3554.98 → 3555.86] so three vision
[3555.86 → 3558.70] back to three division because that's one that sort of matters
[3558.70 → 3559.94] uh...
[3559.94 → 3562.70] all they've done is they've changed the glasses once which actually did
[3562.70 → 3565.96] money unit change the shape but didn't inherently change the technology
[3565.96 → 3569.20] and they've added light boost to the monitors light boost is outstanding
[3569.20 → 3573.10] uh... light boost makes all the difference in the world to three years is there
[3573.10 → 3576.36] if you do is you get a headache from it then you don't care about three d if you don't
[3576.36 → 3578.74] get a headache from it, you might care about three d
[3578.74 → 3582.68] and uh... there's no reason to not invest in it now because the reality of
[3582.68 → 3586.74] it is a three d monitor at one twenty hertz is a better and smoother gaming
[3586.74 → 3590.28] experience even if you're not in three d if you care about responsiveness
[3590.28 → 3593.54] anyway, so there are lots of reasons to get the three hardware and then after that
[3593.54 → 3596.02] the glasses are only another hundred bucks you can always borrow someone else's
[3596.02 → 3599.58] glasses that you know, and you know try it before you buy I always recommend
[3599.58 → 3603.16] with three d try before you buy it's really important because lots of people just
[3603.16 → 3607.06] get headaches three division v one I get a splitting headache within about five
[3607.06 → 3610.92] seconds of putting on the glasses whereas with light boost and three division
[3610.92 → 3615.50] v two I can go for a long time without actually feeling any discomfort so it's
[3615.50 → 3617.54] pretty much there for me
[3617.54 → 3620.54] I just don't prefer three d two
[3620.54 → 3624.64] large format high resolution monitors so when they can deliver a high resolution
[3624.64 → 3629.04] four k three d monitor to me then thumbs up but for now I'll take my twenty-five
[3629.04 → 3633.00] sixty resolution versus my nineteen twenty by ten eighty-one twenty hertz
[3633.00 → 3636.12] it's a trade-off because there's only so much bandwidth the DVI connection can
[3636.12 → 3637.94] carry
[3637.94 → 3639.02] okay
[3639.02 → 3643.30] Joseph forty-two four just a four rates in hey Linus how do you manage to
[3643.30 → 3644.90] juggle spending time with
[3644.90 → 3646.64] your new child new life
[3646.64 → 3649.72] your job your YouTube channels and leisure and recreation
[3649.72 → 3653.14] uh... it's hard actually to be perfectly honest thank you for asking and thank you
[3653.14 → 3656.44] for understanding that what I'm doing is actually a lot of work uh...
[3656.44 → 3659.24] I don't spend as much time with the baby as I should be doing
[3659.24 → 3662.60] uh... or with the life as I'd probably should be doing however I'll be making
[3662.60 → 3663.80] some adjustments
[3663.80 → 3666.82] this is part of the big announcement coming soon over the next maybe next
[3666.82 → 3667.96] three months or so
[3667.96 → 3669.76] that uh... should help with that
[3669.76 → 3672.94] uh... it's been difficult I mean my job is uh...
[3672.94 → 3675.44] my job stressful my job is not easy
[3675.44 → 3679.96] I'm a product manager and the category manager and I still oversee the pc division
[3679.96 → 3681.44] events x
[3681.44 → 3685.48] and I do this YouTube stuff so it's a lot of work uh...
[3685.48 → 3687.32] it's a lot of our spread
[3687.32 → 3690.18] I'm hopefully going to try and find a way to cut that back a little bit
[3690.18 → 3692.72] gradually here at the YouTube channels again i
[3692.72 → 3695.92] this comes back to why do I keep making videos because I actually do have fun i
[3695.92 → 3697.88] like engaging with you guys I like
[3697.88 → 3700.48] uh... I like educating people I like sharing my passion
[3700.48 → 3701.48] uh...
[3701.48 → 3705.00] as for leisure and recreation I found I've played badminton
[3705.00 → 3708.86] six or seven times since the baby was born so that's in the last four months
[3708.86 → 3713.06] so I haven't found much time for my leisure activities but uh...
[3713.06 → 3716.30] you know again hopefully I'll be able to restore some balance over the next little
[3716.30 → 3718.34] while here
[3718.34 → 3720.30] uh... nor hor
[3720.30 → 3721.52] great name
[3721.52 → 3724.46] what is the difference between the city ports on my motherboard
[3724.46 → 3725.84] there are different speeds
[3725.84 → 3729.18] and that's self-explanatory but I wonder about that some of them are connected to a
[3729.18 → 3733.46] third-party controller and some of them are linked directly to the motherboard chipset
[3733.46 → 3735.18] why aren't they all connected
[3735.18 → 3739.14] to either the motherboard chipset or a third-party controller and which I use for
[3739.14 → 3740.80] normal operation arrayed
[3740.80 → 3745.98] great question because it really depends on the configuration of your board so
[3745.98 → 3749.80] uh... for a single boot drive or like to raid zero boot drives
[3749.80 → 3751.00] always use
[3751.00 → 3752.34] the two intel
[3752.34 → 3754.76] city three sixty-day connect uh... that
[3754.76 → 3758.24] six gigabit per second connections they are the best performing
[3758.24 → 3762.36] and they're not going through any additional PCIE switches or anything like that so they
[3762.36 → 3765.02] have a direct communication path to the CPU
[3765.02 → 3766.92] now the reason that
[3766.92 → 3767.70] excuse me
[3767.70 → 3770.14] many manufacturers are implementing additional
[3770.14 → 3771.70] city ports is because
[3771.70 → 3772.86] intel's chipset
[3772.86 → 3775.88] only supports six ports
[3775.88 → 3777.84] so I'm going to see if I can play at the c there's
[3777.84 → 3779.42] lots more ports there
[3779.42 → 3783.64] uh... so if they want to give users the flexibility or the option to install more
[3783.64 → 3787.06] drives than they have to use their party chipsets
[3787.06 → 3790.18] and it's not simple yeah then the intel chipset only supports two say two three
[3790.18 → 3791.84] six gigabit per second ports
[3791.84 → 3794.62] and then four say two three gigabits per second ports
[3794.62 → 3797.62] so yeah they want to add more than they have to do it through three
[3797.62 → 3798.88] party chipsets
[3798.88 → 3800.40] uh... it comes down to what the
[3800.40 → 3803.78] with the mother or what the chipset manufacturer that is India intel
[3803.78 → 3805.48] aspects in
[3805.48 → 3808.28] so why aren't they all one or the other because
[3808.28 → 3811.04] the motherboard makers think you need more of the'd
[3811.04 → 3813.40] they want you to have more
[3813.40 → 3814.96] okay
[3814.96 → 3817.22] uh... Linus fan double seven wow
[3817.22 → 3818.62] that's uh... not
[3818.62 → 3820.14] you know sucking up at all
[3820.14 → 3823.64] uh... highlight this you know I'm one of your biggest fans I did not know that but
[3823.64 → 3824.38] thank you
[3824.38 → 3828.50] I have seen almost all uploaded YouTube videos, but sadly you have never replied
[3828.50 → 3829.26] to me
[3829.26 → 3831.58] well here's my reply thank you for watching
[3831.58 → 3835.18] anyway can ask your full name, and please mention my name AIF
[3835.18 → 3838.82] near in your q a session and will you upload the session later on YouTube yes i
[3838.82 → 3839.52] will
[3839.52 → 3842.26] and lastly your cats are cute and yes I know thank you
[3842.26 → 3846.26] uh... my phone is minus Sebastian if you'd watch all my videos you'd know that
[3846.26 → 3849.44] because I'm ready to use actually say my full name at the beginning of every
[3849.44 → 3850.56] single one
[3850.56 → 3851.90] uh... so damn
[3851.90 → 3853.18] you just got called out
[3853.18 → 3853.92] soccer
[3853.92 → 3854.78] uh...
[3854.78 → 3856.92] but then you ask to be called out so I think
[3856.92 → 3858.38] we're still we're still cool
[3858.38 → 3859.38] uh...
[3859.38 → 3862.28] last question on my pre-scheduled questions
[3862.28 → 3864.52] from crumpets ninety-five
[3864.52 → 3868.22] what are your reasons for not using dedicated benchmarking software test
[3868.22 → 3869.12] components
[3869.12 → 3872.78] is there a tested reason behind your decision used prefer
[3872.78 → 3874.82] to get more realistic test environments
[3874.82 → 3877.42] would you like to see other tech channels move away from benchmarking
[3877.42 → 3878.30] software
[3878.30 → 3881.14] uh... the reason I stopped using benchmarking software is that it
[3881.14 → 3882.58] is totally meaningless
[3882.58 → 3884.94] uh... there are some things were benchmarking can tell you useful
[3884.94 → 3886.76] information like with storage
[3886.76 → 3888.94] uh... whereas there are other things like video cards
[3888.94 → 3890.96] where all the pre-canned benchmarks
[3890.96 → 3896.06] are so heavily optimized in played around with by both in video and AMD
[3896.06 → 3900.06] that it becomes not a useful comparison of the power of one piece of
[3900.06 → 3901.40] hardware versus the other one
[3901.40 → 3904.80] so that's why the only way to truly gauge the performance of these parts is to use
[3904.80 → 3905.64] real games
[3905.64 → 3908.28] you can't use specs you can't use can benchmark
[3908.28 → 3909.20] forget about it
[3909.20 → 3910.48] use real games
[3910.48 → 3912.08] uh... or your you know
[3912.08 → 3915.12] real menus real games there I'll say that
[3915.12 → 3919.12] so now since I'm done with all the pre-submitted questions on my goodness
[3919.12 → 3924.34] k twitter has checked this out you guys
[3924.34 → 3928.14] three hundred and fifty new interactions this last time I looked at it come on guys
[3928.14 → 3929.24] realistically
[3929.24 → 3934.74] I had not going to be able to answer all of them uh... but I'll hang around for a
[3934.74 → 3935.82] little while longer
[3935.82 → 3939.66] I didn't tend to do only a one-hour live stream, and we're at an hour and five
[3939.66 → 3941.04] minutes but uh...
[3941.04 → 3941.88] so I think it's a good point
[3941.88 → 3946.08] so I'm going to have a look at some of the more recent tweets just because I think the
[3946.08 → 3951.48] odds of some of the earlier tweets still being watching the live stream seems lower I'm actually
[3951.48 → 3955.12] overwhelmed thank you guys for watching by the way because there's two thousand viewers
[3955.12 → 3959.70] right now which is just, just amazing to see the kind of support you guys are giving
[3959.70 → 3963.16] to this kind of new initiative from me
[3963.16 → 3964.56] all right
[3964.56 → 3968.16] hey Linus can you please do an unboxing video on some dell no
[3968.16 → 3970.12] uh... again this
[3970.12 → 3973.94] comes down to you know how much of what I do is sponsored and how much of what I do is my choice
[3973.94 → 3975.00] number one
[3975.00 → 3979.06] by choice I don't really have any interest in dell products beyond their monitors and number two
[3979.06 → 3982.38] dell is a direct competitor for NCI so I have no desire
[3982.38 → 3985.60] as a NCI employee to support them so
[3985.60 → 3986.94] no
[3986.94 → 3989.70] uh... when do you think DisplayPort will become more of a standard
[3989.70 → 3992.46] uh... have no idea arm
[3992.46 → 3995.18] everyone seems very reluctant to
[3995.18 → 4000.20] to move away from DVD and even DGS is on so many things still today I wish it would
[4000.20 → 4001.50] just go away
[4001.50 → 4003.14] uh...
[4003.14 → 4005.46] I mean
[4005.46 → 4010.02] every video card is at a DVD I port for what six seven
[4010.02 → 4012.40] eight years now like every decent video card
[4012.40 → 4014.84] right now it's still only
[4014.84 → 4019.70] especially on the India side the high-end video cards that even have DisplayPort outputs
[4019.70 → 4023.46] so what that means to me is we are nowhere near widespread adoption
[4023.46 → 4035.96] like nowhere even close you look at how long it like will probably have a new standard by the time DisplayPort is completely dominant like the way we had DisplayPort by the time DVI was completely dominant so
[4035.96 → 4038.72] uh...
[4038.72 → 4042.48] uh... get slick to do reviews and unboxing for you so you have more free time
[4042.48 → 4045.24] uh... if slick wanted to be on the camera he could be
[4045.24 → 4046.24] so
[4046.24 → 4047.36] there's that
[4047.36 → 4048.74] I have a VGA monitor
[4048.74 → 4052.04] fourteen forty by nine hundred would it be better investment to buy a ten eighty p monitor
[4052.04 → 4053.82] or upgrading my graphics card
[4053.82 → 4058.24] fps leg in battlefield three get a new graphics card and any monitor but do the graphics card
[4058.24 → 4061.24] first victor
[4061.24 → 4068.24] uh... sabertoothed computing do you think the power cover of seventy-nine ninety will be the GTX six ninety performance wise that's really easy
[4068.24 → 4076.00] do to seventy-nine seventys beat to six eighties performance wise there's no special sauce in these dual GPU cards they're just
[4076.00 → 4078.00] two GPUs and instead of
[4078.00 → 4085.00] an external sly bridge connecting to video cards there's an internal sly bridge on a PCB connecting to graphics chips so
[4085.00 → 4092.00] uh... you can usually deduce how uh... but people been asking me for months how do you think a seventy-nine ninety will perform
[4092.66 → 4097.64] exactly like two seventy-nine seventies, or you know depending on the clock speed or how many
[4097.64 → 4098.56] how many uh...
[4098.56 → 4101.30] shaders they have active or whatever else
[4101.30 → 4106.42] Alexander says I'm looking in buying a keyboard and I'm going to use it for fps games I'm looking at the black widow ultimate or the
[4106.42 → 4112.76] rival sixty get the rival sixty the black will ultimate still quality is near compared to the rival sixty or something from the likes of filch
[4115.00 → 4118.00] uh...
[4118.00 → 4122.00] let's see so I'm going to read these I'm going to try and find some of the more interesting ones so
[4122.00 → 4127.00] all nineteen hundred and twenty-seven of you don't have to sit through really boring stuff
[4127.00 → 4128.00] um...
[4128.00 → 4134.66] minus what are your steps to diagnosing a deal a motherboard or component I have a motherboard I believe is dealt a what would you do I have a video I would watch the video
[4134.66 → 4140.66] it's called no post diagnosis if you search for it on YouTube it's on my NCI dot com channel
[4140.66 → 4144.66] and it should pretty much walk you through the steps that you need to go through to determine what is wrong with your computer
[4144.66 → 4145.66] uh...
[4145.66 → 4146.66] uh...
[4146.66 → 4147.66] uh...
[4147.66 → 4148.66] uh...
[4148.66 → 4149.66] uh...
[4149.66 → 4150.66] uh...
[4150.66 → 4151.66] uh...
[4151.66 → 4152.66] uh...
[4152.66 → 4153.66] uh...
[4153.66 → 4154.66] uh...
[4154.66 → 4155.66] uh...
[4155.66 → 4156.66] uh...
[4156.66 → 4157.66] uh...
[4157.66 → 4158.66] uh...
[4158.66 → 4159.66] uh...
[4159.66 → 4161.66] uh...
[4161.66 → 4162.66] uh...
[4162.66 → 4163.66] uh...
[4163.66 → 4164.66] uh...
[4164.66 → 4165.66] uh...
[4165.66 → 4166.66] uh...
[4166.66 → 4168.66] uh...
[4168.66 → 4169.66] uh...
[4169.66 → 4170.66] uh...
[4170.66 → 4173.18] And then you go, how much can I sell this one for?
[4173.32 → 4174.48] How much is this one going to cost me?
[4174.72 → 4177.44] How much am I paying for per performance increase?
[4177.58 → 4178.54] And you go from there.
[4178.58 → 4179.40] It's not rocket science.
[4180.74 → 4181.10] Okay.
[4181.36 → 4184.00] What power supplies do you think are better, single rail or multiple rail?
[4184.26 → 4186.00] I don't think it makes much of a difference these days.
[4186.14 → 4189.92] Multi-rail power supplies are well laid out so that you're not going to trigger the overcurrent
[4189.92 → 4192.06] protection on any decent multi-rail power supply.
[4192.24 → 4196.88] So go with whatever you think looks good and has a good review at Johnny Guru.
[4197.20 → 4199.36] Basically, the only power supply reviews that matter.
[4199.58 → 4200.16] Johnny Guru.
[4200.66 → 4201.66] Johnny Guru.
[4202.02 → 4203.90] Can I get Gabe Newell on my show?
[4205.00 → 4207.30] Gabe, if you're watching, come on the show.
[4207.62 → 4208.72] Other than that, probably not.
[4212.18 → 4213.86] I've got a question for your live stream.
[4213.92 → 4215.68] What education did you have to get your job?
[4216.00 → 4220.54] Actually, I flunked out of University of British Columbia after a couple of years there.
[4221.16 → 4224.40] I was in the general science program and couldn't cut it.
[4225.72 → 4226.50] Yeah, that's rough.
[4226.50 → 4230.24] So I thought, you know, I tried to help you out a consistent knowledge network that was
[4230.24 → 4231.20] as well.
[4231.20 → 4232.08] What précised work was made?
[4232.08 → 4235.00] So by reimbursement, although you use the 섭 rice, that's an especially good data sector,
[4235.00 → 4242.78] it was space and cones for
[4242.78 → 4243.36] a iOS 25.
[4243.36 → 4244.26] Now the others who werezubák me wooded and didn't know him anything.
[4244.26 → 4251.96] just ludicrous. We're double the average computer cost of almost any other sales guy in the company.
[4252.52 → 4256.84] And they asked me about this. They were like, what are you doing? Like, are you just a fantastic
[4256.84 → 4260.94] sales guy? And I went, well, no, I'm telling people what they need because people come in and
[4260.94 → 4264.44] they're like, yeah, I want to play like Half-Life 2 on max details. And I'm not going to be like
[4264.44 → 4269.46] some dumb sales guy and be like, oh, yeah, you know, I don't know, here's the top thing in like
[4269.46 → 4273.66] the on sale list and, you know, get one of these. I'm going to be like, well, no, you know, you need
[4273.66 → 4278.44] like 27900 GTs in SLI. You want to build like a flight sim computer, and you want to run like,
[4278.86 → 4283.04] you know, triple monitors. I mean, back then it was harder. You need like two of these and this is
[4283.04 → 4287.10] the best value. And if you spend more money on this video card, but then you drop the CPU,
[4287.30 → 4290.86] but then you get a better motherboard, then you'll be able to do this. And then you can add more RAM.
[4290.86 → 4295.72] And so what I really did was I helped me. This is exactly the same thing I do now. I helped people
[4295.72 → 4300.16] configure their machine such that they would come in a week after they got it, and they'd be like, oh,
[4300.16 → 4306.00] man, Linus, I am so happy that I spent the extra here, and I saved the money there. And this computer
[4306.00 → 4311.70] is amazing. And, you know, I'm so glad that you helped me with this. And I always took satisfaction
[4311.70 → 4316.44] from that. So from there, they asked me to come to head office and work on the PC configurations
[4316.44 → 4322.78] on the website. One day I was like, oh, well, why don't we sell any water cooling stuff? And my boss
[4322.78 → 4328.56] at the time said, well, get on it then. So that was how I got into product management. So I was still
[4328.56 → 4332.96] managing the PCs. And then I started contacting all these water cooling suppliers and bringing
[4332.96 → 4336.96] on all this water cooling stuff. And then NCI started to make a bunch of money from that. So
[4336.96 → 4341.34] they went, oh, maybe we should use this guy to do like more product management on higher level
[4341.34 → 4348.74] stuff. And then I was good at that. So then they asked me to manage other people, other product
[4348.74 → 4354.30] managers from a category level while still maintaining my product portfolio. And then somewhere in there,
[4354.30 → 4357.84] all the YouTube stuff started happening. And that's kind of how it happened. I mean, I think
[4357.84 → 4362.14] that, you know, education is important. You know, I can't emphasize that enough, even though
[4362.14 → 4368.62] I don't really have a proper one. But if you are willing to work your bushy off, and if you
[4368.62 → 4373.52] have like a talent and a skill that, and you have a little bit of luck, I mean, it takes luck,
[4373.52 → 4378.12] you know, for someone to even notice you and give you a chance, then you can really do a lot,
[4378.12 → 4389.86] even without the piece of paper. So there, that's how I got my job. Okay. Let me just see if there's
[4389.86 → 4392.20] anything else here that I haven't. Steven.
[4392.20 → 4401.06] Steven, Thank you.
[4401.06 → 4401.48] Stevenson, broadcasting,
[4401.48 → 4406.32] Just introduce Dave to you Jim's of Brockman I can't actually have the app in the list of
[4406.32 → 4409.42] membrane. And Bayard to see if there is a site where I will ἀ gust you click on your
[4409.42 → 4415.32] note. Just a look on a computer page last year but not only in the newsroom case record time
[4415.32 → 4417.66] on that, which likely could be now the price that you are adding more money.
[4418.40 → 4420.56] It most likely does it have to know when.
[4420.56 → 4423.50] another I don't know let's do about another seven minutes here guys, so I'm
[4423.50 → 4425.84] gonna hopefully get to your questions
[4425.84 → 4430.04] ah Maurice writes in what do you think of Korean monitors like the Yamazaki
[4430.04 → 4434.84] cat leap or achieve a shimmy and Linus I think that they are using lower grade
[4434.84 → 4440.90] panels so if you are a super discerning customer then you probably won't be that
[4440.90 → 4444.98] thrilled with it so for me, I looked at them and I considered buying three
[4444.98 → 4450.14] because I love high-res monitors love high pixel density I love multi-monitor
[4450.14 → 4454.70] setups and right now I'm only using a single 30-inch, and I was like okay but
[4454.70 → 4460.66] if I buy three what are the odds I'm going to have bright dots or dead pixels am I
[4460.66 → 4464.78] really happy with the industrial design of this bezel, or would I rather just save
[4464.78 → 4468.20] my pennies for another even if I have to save for another year or two I
[4468.20 → 4472.46] personally believe your monitor is one of the most important things you buy for
[4472.46 → 4478.70] your computer I've bought three monitors in my life for my personal machine I
[4478.70 → 4484.34] have bought a view sonic p95 f plus B that was pretty much the best 19 inches CRT
[4484.34 → 4488.48] you could get it used aperture grill in order to make sure that the geometry was
[4488.48 → 4493.52] perfect it had great colour and my sister in a fit of rage at one point took a
[4493.52 → 4498.44] quarter and scratched the anti-glare coating, and I was devastated because now I
[4498.44 → 4503.48] had to go first to okay, so I had four monitors so after that that monitor I
[4503.48 → 4506.30] didn't really have a lot of money because I hadn't been saving up for a monitor I
[4506.30 → 4512.54] was expecting to have to buy one, and I bought myself an Acer 1916 1916 W or
[4512.54 → 4519.08] something was VGA only it was uh 1440 by 900 res it was a 19-inch LCD, and I was
[4519.08 → 4526.62] just so dissatisfied with um with a value monitor that I vowed, and so I bought
[4526.62 → 4533.12] myself a Dell 2405 FPW I bought it used I paid about 600 bucks for it and that
[4533.12 → 4536.90] monitor is still in use today, so this is about six and a half years down the road
[4536.90 → 4540.44] so this is again this comes back to my philosophy about monitors why do you buy
[4540.44 → 4544.46] a good monitor because it might still be on your desk six seven years down the road
[4544.46 → 4550.94] my wife's still using that monitor and then um three years ago I um I needed a
[4550.94 → 4554.96] monitor for her machine so that she could play games and I decided to save up for a
[4554.96 → 4559.78] while and I got myself a Samsung 305 T Plus, so I got myself a nice this is what I
[4559.78 → 4563.26] really wanted when I bought that 24 inch, but they were like two grand at the
[4563.26 → 4566.56] time so it wasn't going to happen, but finally they'd come down to a price that
[4566.56 → 4570.52] I could that I could save up for and I got myself one of those which I'm still
[4570.52 → 4576.04] using to this day I will not upgrade my monitor again until I can buy 4k at a
[4576.04 → 4581.24] reasonable price um or until I can get some kind of compelling new technology that
[4581.24 → 4585.84] delivers dramatically better brightness or colour something like a MO LED in a 30
[4585.84 → 4591.12] inch or 27 inch high pixel density format, so I believe that um I believe that
[4591.12 → 4595.38] monitors are an investment like speakers and headphones and sound cards, and they're
[4595.38 → 4600.48] not something to be cheaper out on like um you know video cards and CPUs and memory
[4600.48 → 4604.56] you know by only as much memory as you need whereas you should overbuy on your
[4604.56 → 4607.56] monitor and your speakers in your case and the things that are you're going to
[4607.56 → 4612.60] carry with you through multiple builds I mean I've had a dozen video cards in the
[4612.60 → 4616.62] time that I've had two monitors so that should tell you how much of an investment
[4616.62 → 4622.20] a monitor is worth to me versus a video card that said they're a great value so if
[4622.20 → 4624.90] you're looking to save a buck, and you want to experience high-res then hey go
[4624.90 → 4630.96] for it right okay why is there such a performance gap between the AMD 7000 series
[4630.96 → 4634.50] and the 600 series from Nvidia I don't think there is when you overclock them both
[4634.50 → 4639.36] they're actually in a dead heat, so I've got a great video coming out soon with the
[4639.36 → 4648.18] 660 TI 7950 7870, and I think 670, and I overclock them all to the max to see where
[4648.18 → 4652.44] performance actually lines up in the 7950 does really well especially given the
[4652.44 → 4657.96] new pricing that it's at these days okay what's the difference between Sandy
[4657.96 → 4660.52] Bridge and Ivy Bridge, and what's the best for gaming Ivy Bridge is newer and
[4660.52 → 4666.12] faster Sandy Bridge runs a little cooler and is older best for gaming they're pretty
[4666.12 → 4672.12] similar Kyle do I tweet you or do I comment on the YouTube live stream do
[4672.12 → 4674.94] not comment on the YouTube live stream I understand it's probably a little late
[4674.94 → 4678.42] to say this, but those comments come through like 50 at a time I can't read
[4678.42 → 4683.22] them, and I'm not even looking at it Twitter's good, or I'm going to be doing
[4683.22 → 4687.30] before I do any of these live streams I'll be posting on the YouTube channel a
[4687.30 → 4692.52] link to a Reddit thread which will allow people to vote up the comments are the
[4692.52 → 4696.24] questions that they think are our best and that actually worked really well for
[4696.24 → 4700.26] this live stream I think unless you guys have sort of another comment that you
[4700.26 → 4709.14] think it didn't work Anders all usernames are taken okay what do you prefer
[4709.14 → 4714.76] Intel or AMD also in video or AMD ATI some of my most popular videos on YouTube if
[4714.76 → 4720.18] you search for AMD versus Intel or AMD versus Nvidia I have videos on it already so
[4720.18 → 4724.80] go for it check it out that's what I think the answer is there's no answer if
[4724.80 → 4725.58] you want me to cheat
[4725.58 → 4732.30] Nilesh Jayashenka says why are high-end Nvidia Squadron cards more expensive than
[4732.30 → 4736.74] GeForce cards because those customers are willing to pay more and also the
[4736.74 → 4740.82] validation and software development that goes into those cards costs a lot more
[4740.82 → 4746.10] the support that Nvidia has to provide to customers of those cards costs a lot
[4746.10 → 4749.76] more so you know what okay since we still have questions pouring in and
[4749.76 → 4752.76] there's still over 2,000 people watching we're going to keep going a little bit
[4752.76 → 4755.64] longer, but I need to get myself something to drink because I have been
[4755.64 → 4761.16] talking for 80 minutes straight which even for me is like bit of a challenge so
[4761.16 → 4763.98] I'll be back in a sec
[4763.98 → 4775.06] I'll be back in a sec
[4775.06 → 4776.32] I think the numbers go on Manchester United for OC Uber
[4776.32 → 4779.08] and then there's still a bit of a challenge such as we got to go on at least
[4779.08 → 4782.20] in content all number five and ten language able to win and email
[4782.20 → 4791.14] up the landline should also be more defensive and to go for some
[4791.14 → 4797.62] What do you mean no drink for me?
[4798.02 → 4798.98] Yes, drink for me.
[4799.34 → 4802.46] Someone just tweeted no drink for you, but they're wrong.
[4802.98 → 4803.48] Who is that?
[4804.86 → 4806.34] Corey McGrath, you're banned.
[4806.88 → 4811.60] You're no longer invited to view my live stream because I am going to enjoy this Tropical,
[4811.68 → 4812.58] whether you like it or not.
[4813.02 → 4816.56] And yes, Tropical, the best orange juice, something, something, paid product.
[4816.64 → 4817.14] No, I'm just kidding.
[4817.26 → 4818.82] There's no paid product placements here.
[4818.82 → 4824.32] I'm just drinking Tropical because I like it, and my wife bought some.
[4825.30 → 4831.14] And so it's my job to consume it as far as I can tell when she buys things and puts them in the fridge,
[4831.82 → 4832.50] which is amazing.
[4832.82 → 4836.42] So I'm sorry, I'm going to move the mic so that you guys don't have to hear a mic and a drinking noise.
[4843.92 → 4844.42] All right.
[4844.64 → 4847.40] So I'm going to stop looking at some of the older Twitters.
[4847.40 → 4851.28] And let's get to some of the newer ones again.
[4852.96 → 4860.24] So I'm going to look at the 229 new interactions here, and hopefully we'll get some good questions
[4860.24 → 4860.88] that we can answer.
[4862.04 → 4864.94] Alex, really looking forward to Windows 8.
[4865.02 → 4869.22] Does a 10 to 12-inch touchscreen monitor I can put flat on my desk exist?
[4869.58 → 4871.28] Would love that to control Metro.
[4871.92 → 4872.72] Great idea.
[4872.72 → 4873.40] You know what?
[4873.50 → 4876.84] I mean, that's the kind of stuff that Windows 8 is going to enable.
[4876.96 → 4884.10] I'm personally not excited for Windows 8 on my personal desktop, but I'm excited for Windows 8 on different devices.
[4884.28 → 4891.52] And I'm going to cover that in this week's episode of Net linked Weekly, which I actually still have to edit and upload tonight
[4891.52 → 4898.86] because Slick, bless his heart, is at PAX and is therefore not available to me at this point in time.
[4898.98 → 4900.70] So I have to edit it myself.
[4900.80 → 4904.52] Although there's not much editing with Net linked Weekly, and I did have cameraman to help me film it.
[4905.98 → 4909.02] Would I recommend an FX-8150, or should I just wait for Pile driver?
[4909.02 → 4912.36] You should just buy an Intel CPU, to be perfectly honest, at this point in time.
[4913.86 → 4914.48] I know.
[4914.58 → 4919.84] I know it's hard, but just get a 2,500K or a 3,570 and call it a day.
[4921.44 → 4924.62] Phil writes, and what do you think about the whole Samsung-Apple debacle?
[4925.00 → 4926.54] I think they both need to grow up.
[4926.90 → 4928.20] I think they're both wrong.
[4928.34 → 4929.32] I think they're both right.
[4930.00 → 4933.94] I think that that much is clear based on that in certain territories.
[4934.16 → 4934.76] One of them is winning.
[4934.86 → 4936.36] In certain territories, the other one is winning.
[4936.36 → 4942.62] I think that ultimately this is going to be a negative thing for consumers
[4942.62 → 4948.50] because it's going to damage the relationship that these two companies have
[4948.50 → 4952.52] where Samsung provides a lot of the quality components that go in Apple products.
[4953.58 → 4956.50] And, yeah, I think it's just bad for everybody.
[4956.64 → 4957.36] It's bad for innovation.
[4957.58 → 4961.48] It's bad for Apple's bottom line, although I don't know if they're that bad for Apple.
[4961.48 → 4962.48] It seems to be doing okay.
[4966.36 → 4972.54] I mean, that said, I'm with them on certain things where, you know, I don't think it's fair for,
[4972.90 → 4974.40] again, you know, it comes back to any product.
[4974.50 → 4976.68] I don't think it's fair for Synology to develop this NAS
[4976.68 → 4981.46] and for someone else to basically, you know, like use a 3D printer to print out the same thing
[4981.46 → 4986.02] and then, you know, brand it differently and for them to make a bunch of money off the work
[4986.02 → 4989.18] that ultimately someone else did and the branding that someone else did.
[4989.18 → 4996.54] Something that a lot of hardcore IT tech customers don't understand is the amount of work
[4996.54 → 5002.98] and the amount of design and the amount of thought that goes into things that don't actually affect performance.
[5003.52 → 5012.42] Like the amount of engineering that went into Apple determining that this is the ideal shape is phenomenal.
[5012.42 → 5017.24] And I don't think you should be able to patent a shape per se,
[5017.44 → 5022.14] but I also don't think that you should just be, you know, pulling out your telescope and being like,
[5022.18 → 5023.36] oh, what are those guys doing?
[5023.42 → 5026.76] Let's do sort of that because they seem to know what they're doing, and they're making boatloads of money.
[5026.94 → 5029.04] So, again, I don't think anyone's right.
[5029.10 → 5030.18] I don't think anyone's really wrong.
[5033.48 → 5034.08] Let's see.
[5034.20 → 5035.28] Best mechanical keyboard.
[5035.96 → 5037.00] Don't say the Corsair.
[5037.06 → 5037.68] It's too blue.
[5037.94 → 5038.78] This is from Josh.
[5038.78 → 5041.14] I wouldn't have said the Corsair because I don't like red switches,
[5041.36 → 5045.02] but my personal favourite right now is the Leonid Final 60.
[5045.36 → 5047.14] That's the one I'm using on my personal machine.
[5050.24 → 5051.78] Adam Cochin writes in,
[5051.92 → 5054.22] what is the absolute best time to buy computer parts?
[5054.92 → 5056.38] In Canada, Boxing Week.
[5057.10 → 5059.00] In the U.S., probably Black Friday.
[5060.02 → 5061.04] He already knew the answer.
[5061.04 → 5063.76] He asked if those were the right times, and so, yes, they are.
[5066.10 → 5066.70] Teammate says,
[5066.70 → 5068.72] I have a stuck pixel over your face.
[5069.02 → 5070.34] Do you know any way to get rid of stuck pixels?
[5070.56 → 5072.44] Actually, there are a couple tricks.
[5072.52 → 5074.28] They don't always work, but if you look for,
[5074.98 → 5076.42] here, I'm just going to check really quick,
[5076.52 → 5078.56] but I think it's YouTube search.
[5079.18 → 5080.44] What is a dead pixel?
[5081.54 → 5084.08] That should bring up my video about dead pixels and stuck pixels.
[5085.04 → 5086.28] What is a dead pixel?
[5087.42 → 5090.32] And I am hit number one with 120,000 views.
[5090.32 → 5090.68] Bam!
[5090.98 → 5093.98] Take that, everyone else who tried to make a video about dead pixels.
[5093.98 → 5094.96] Ha ha!
[5096.90 → 5098.36] Not that I'm gloating or anything,
[5098.50 → 5100.28] because my YouTube videos are way better than theirs,
[5100.36 → 5101.30] but they are.
[5108.52 → 5109.30] Taylor says,
[5109.42 → 5112.06] Linus, I'm up at 2 a.m. trying to get you to answer.
[5112.28 → 5113.46] Store in Ottawa, possibly.
[5113.86 → 5115.42] Probably not coming anytime soon.
[5115.42 → 5120.14] Any plans to compare the H100 and ELC240?
[5121.78 → 5123.90] Probably not anytime soon.
[5125.26 → 5126.02] I mean, honestly,
[5126.54 → 5129.00] these pre-done liquid coolers aren't rocket science.
[5129.34 → 5132.08] They're all using low-end fantastic CPU blocks,
[5132.20 → 5134.82] so we can assume that they're all kind of similar.
[5135.28 → 5138.76] And then it comes down to how much surface area is the radiator
[5138.76 → 5141.06] and how good are the fans that you put on it.
[5141.06 → 5144.10] And you basically shouldn't use any fans that are included with any of them anyway,
[5144.20 → 5148.10] so just get a good fan and put it on there and call it a day.
[5149.12 → 5149.88] Damian says,
[5150.00 → 5150.96] Dude, I'm late.
[5151.08 → 5151.34] Sorry.
[5152.16 → 5152.74] Then in that case,
[5152.76 → 5154.16] I'm not going to answer your question.
[5154.86 → 5155.50] Actually, I will.
[5156.12 → 5159.00] But did you talk about the 60 hertz versus 120 hertz video yet?
[5159.08 → 5160.92] The game wasn't getting 120 FPS, man.
[5161.70 → 5162.44] It doesn't matter.
[5162.86 → 5164.16] And yes, I did cover this already,
[5164.22 → 5165.62] so I can't really go too far into this,
[5165.66 → 5166.38] but it doesn't matter,
[5166.38 → 5169.50] because you guys will see in the follow-up video
[5169.50 → 5173.36] that whatever you see in the follow-up video makes a difference.
[5173.74 → 5176.18] And that'll be coming hopefully sometime in the next week or so.
[5176.40 → 5178.66] So week or so.
[5178.92 → 5179.72] So stay tuned.
[5181.20 → 5181.56] Matthew,
[5182.04 → 5185.72] what is the max could you have your GTX 660 Ti?
[5185.84 → 5186.54] I just bought one,
[5186.66 → 5187.30] non-overclocked,
[5187.30 → 5187.78] and I was wondering,
[5188.14 → 5189.24] well, it depends on which one you bought.
[5189.28 → 5190.06] If you have a power edition,
[5190.06 → 5193.56] you can probably get another 200 plus megahertz on the boost clock.
[5193.56 → 5195.34] If you didn't buy a power edition,
[5195.46 → 5197.72] then you might get another 80, 90 megahertz.
[5198.70 → 5199.06] Julian,
[5199.22 → 5200.54] will NCI expand to Malaysia?
[5200.70 → 5203.74] We certainly won't physically expand to Malaysia anytime soon,
[5203.78 → 5205.90] but it's possible we'll start shipping there sometime in the future.
[5206.04 → 5208.12] I mean, the world continues to shrink.
[5208.20 → 5209.52] I don't know if you guys saw that news article
[5209.52 → 5213.16] about the plane that they did a test flight of
[5213.16 → 5214.96] and then just dropped it in the ocean at the end.
[5215.00 → 5218.22] It was doing something like three times the speed of sound
[5218.22 → 5219.18] or something along...
[5219.18 → 5219.92] I don't remember.
[5220.04 → 5221.94] It was like quite a few times the speed of sound.
[5221.94 → 5225.40] And the military and Boeing and a bunch of other big names
[5225.40 → 5227.28] are trying to figure out if it's commercially viable.
[5228.04 → 5231.00] Test Tester apparently created a fake Twitter account
[5231.00 → 5232.80] just so that he could follow me and comment to me.
[5232.86 → 5233.88] Thank you for that, I suppose.
[5234.54 → 5235.68] Are you doing more of this later?
[5235.86 → 5236.90] Certainly not later tonight,
[5237.04 → 5240.38] but I will be doing more live streams at some point in the future.
[5240.92 → 5242.58] I haven't decided what kind of schedule
[5242.58 → 5243.64] or what they're going to be about,
[5243.82 → 5244.92] but based on that,
[5244.94 → 5246.80] there's almost 2,100 people watching now.
[5246.84 → 5249.90] I would say that this is good content that people want to see.
[5249.90 → 5251.24] So yeah, I'm going to keep doing it.
[5254.12 → 5256.20] Will you do this for the rest of your life?
[5256.36 → 5257.26] Asks Raul.
[5257.48 → 5259.04] Do you have any long-term plans?
[5259.36 → 5260.66] Do you have any long-term plans?
[5260.68 → 5261.64] He sounds like my dad.
[5263.66 → 5265.90] I have no idea what the future holds.
[5266.04 → 5268.76] I mean, I never would have guessed six years ago
[5268.76 → 5270.22] that I'd be doing this today.
[5270.68 → 5273.60] So six years from now, who knows, man.
[5273.60 → 5276.82] He's on camera phones and down to six years ago.
[5277.04 → 5280.00] And now he's working hard and Jesse says Jason is pretty quick.
[5280.46 → 5281.70] Well, I think he's the first goes.
[5282.24 → 5282.88] He hasn't Seattle.
[5282.90 → 5285.22] He's the second, but were you
[5285.22 → 5286.72] talking to me about the previous time
[5286.72 → 5289.14] he did this case in playing high school and playing high school.
[5289.52 → 5290.66] Jared, and cash Diner.
[5290.68 → 5291.88] I think hood has always been found.
[5292.56 → 5294.14] I'm so excited to be here.
[5294.50 → 5295.66] You know at the time,
[5295.70 → 5298.02] I talked about you about every single PS bars,
[5298.10 → 5300.38] but he's going to play high school
[5300.38 → 5300.60] with unparagene認識.
[5300.70 → 5301.80] He doesn't really Bashkir Hong parties
[5301.80 → 5302.40] He's going to be a deal.
[5302.40 → 5307.94] just because of that PLS panel that it's beautiful
[5307.94 → 5312.32] I'll take a tag or two with a PLS versus a tag or three with an IPS plus
[5312.32 → 5317.02] Deacon what do you think a three-slot graphics cards I think they're fine
[5317.02 → 5321.52] I think that they have their use, but I probably wouldn't use one
[5321.52 → 5325.64] just because it really limits how many expansion cards you can install your
[5325.64 → 5326.32] computer
[5326.32 → 5330.12] so it's great for cooling, but then so is water cooling so
[5330.12 → 5334.08] comes down to personal preference on that one I probably shouldn't even
[5334.08 → 5336.48] answer that question because I can't really say anything
[5336.48 → 5339.66] Timothy what do you think about the cyborg strike seven I think it's
[5339.66 → 5342.66] ridiculous I think it's like a three hundred dollar keyboard, but I'm also
[5342.66 → 5344.28] extremely excited about it so
[5344.28 → 5348.40] I have one inbound I am looking forward to checking it out it's going to come down to
[5348.40 → 5349.08] the software
[5349.08 → 5352.56] if the software makes it like awesome to use then it'll be awesome
[5352.56 → 5355.44] and if the software sucks that it'll suck so
[5355.44 → 5361.22] date I go Julie's
[5361.22 → 5362.82] email if until it gets really wealthier
[5362.82 → 5363.08] said I family
[5363.08 → 5364.02] wasn't a trend
[5364.02 → 5365.78] if that's what I'm
[5365.78 → 5367.68] transformable
[5367.68 → 5369.22] or when I go back and the site
[5369.76 → 5370.88] I'm trying to update their plans
[5371.46 → 5373.20] I feel Morris more freely
[5374.06 → 5376.02] that the stock has come down to health
[5376.02 → 5376.34] I believe that a company onенное
[5376.34 → 5378.68] right now
[5378.68 → 5380.48] that are interesting
[5380.48 → 5385.68] six videos absolutely every once in a while I go back and uh... and check
[5385.68 → 5389.24] out one of the old ones to sit encouraging to see how far we've come
[5389.24 → 5393.50] and also discouraging to see how terrible it wasn't for started but uh...
[5393.50 → 5397.68] notes kinda it's kinda fun uh... I was trying to show slick the episode where
[5397.68 → 5400.92] we did monitor man where I had a big monitor in front of me
[5400.92 → 5404.24] uh... the monitor that ultimately ended up buying in the next to behind it they
[5404.24 → 5406.24] wave my arms around to the side
[5406.24 → 5409.90] it's just totally ridiculous and so uh... we went through some of the older
[5409.90 → 5415.48] videos that is kind of fun it's kind of fun actually
[5415.48 → 5416.20] uh...
[5416.20 → 5417.56] let's see
[5417.56 → 5419.36] got a question for you
[5419.36 → 5421.36] okay not a very good question
[5421.36 → 5424.68] how which games does your wife play do you play Call of Duty black ops or modern
[5424.68 → 5427.06] warfare three noes I don't play Call of Duty
[5427.06 → 5429.98] Call of Duty is for console people sorry Rodrigo
[5429.98 → 5432.74] uh... as for what games my wife plays uh... cheese
[5432.74 → 5434.96] she's played through trying to
[5434.96 → 5437.90] uh... she also used to be pretty into left for dead with me, but we've had so
[5437.90 → 5440.98] little time for gaming once we moved into the new house and then had a baby
[5440.98 → 5442.22] and everything so
[5442.22 → 5446.72] she plays pretty much no games anymore
[5446.72 → 5450.66] uh... Pedro anyway to stop motherboard quail line I used to be easier back when
[5450.66 → 5453.92] the components were actually like coils that you could like seeing you could
[5453.92 → 5456.82] put like you know hot glue on the more nail polish
[5456.82 → 5460.34] uh... these days not really a whole like you do
[5460.34 → 5467.34] who
[5467.34 → 5468.58] yes in the
[5468.58 → 5469.72] deli looper
[5469.72 → 5470.78] the loop
[5470.78 → 5473.40] do you plan on creating a new CX shop in Montreal
[5473.40 → 5477.96] I think it'd be fascinating as there's not much pc shops here at the easy answer is
[5477.96 → 5479.18] probably not
[5479.18 → 5482.70] because uh... Quebec as soon as you have a physical location there
[5482.70 → 5485.22] they want to slap all kinds of regulations on you
[5485.22 → 5486.56] and uh...
[5486.56 → 5490.26] that's not that great
[5490.26 → 5494.08] Curtis how did you meet your wife good question how we met at you at uh... UBC
[5494.08 → 5496.40] university of British Columbia we met in school
[5496.40 → 5500.80] so i we met in some kind of horrible microbiology class that we were both taking
[5500.80 → 5505.66] in
[5505.66 → 5509.66] we got to know each other because I'm not that bright and uh... she was tutoring me in
[5509.66 → 5510.76] math
[5510.76 → 5513.66] and uh... one thing led to another, and now we're married
[5513.66 → 5515.30] atlas
[5515.30 → 5515.86] how
[5515.86 → 5517.66] house like eight years ago now
[5517.66 → 5519.70] crazy
[5519.70 → 5522.70] uh...
[5526.34 → 5527.88] hmm
[5527.88 → 5531.06] yeah I think we're kind of running out of new questions at this point so maybe
[5531.06 → 5535.12] what I'll do is I will uh...
[5535.12 → 5538.34] I'll check out some of the newest tweets and then I think will uh... we'll call this
[5538.34 → 5540.34] quits for tonight
[5548.22 → 5551.82] all right let's go back up to the top two hundred nineteen new interactions apparently
[5551.82 → 5557.02] you guys have not yet tired of sending in tweets
[5557.02 → 5561.34] what does my wife do asks Paul now she's a pharmacist
[5561.34 → 5564.24] and sex store in Alberta uh... you know what
[5564.24 → 5568.14] I can't really comment on future and say I explained the low and say access you know
[5568.14 → 5568.98] what
[5568.98 → 5570.34] Canadian chain so
[5570.34 → 5573.06] it's not impossible
[5573.06 → 5576.34] uh... Sam's idle sixty verses dash keyboard ultimate
[5576.34 → 5580.60] uh... blue verses black switches personally I prefer blues but the too loud
[5580.60 → 5584.20] and the blacks on the side of sixty are felt more like blues than regular blacks
[5584.20 → 5586.48] that have more weight to them if you'll get
[5586.48 → 5588.72] uh... so I'm using as idle sixty
[5588.72 → 5593.20] uh... printed how did slick and I meet and are we good friends yes for friends
[5593.20 → 5597.28] uh... but I'm also his boss, so there's that sort of weird dynamic there
[5597.28 → 5600.72] uh... and we met when I created a video
[5600.72 → 5602.34] uh...
[5602.34 → 5605.86] uh... video sort of call out to my YouTube followers
[5605.86 → 5609.16] that I needed to find the next NCI tech tips assistant
[5609.16 → 5610.96] he was one of the
[5610.96 → 5615.00] I think I got something like sixty seventy eighty applicants
[5615.00 → 5616.32] and uh...
[5616.32 → 5620.62] he was one of the uh... six to eight I forget how many about
[5620.62 → 5626.06] how many did I interview I might have interviewed as many as ten like he was one of about ten people that I interviewed and uh...
[5626.06 → 5630.38] he's his camera work I know is suspect at best
[5630.38 → 5633.22] uh... but he's very technical he's able to help me
[5633.22 → 5638.74] in ways that some of the other people wouldn't have with the prep work that's involved in tech tips which is honestly
[5638.74 → 5644.06] uh... in terms of creating what I believe is better content is more important
[5644.06 → 5645.74] than necessarily
[5645.74 → 5647.38] the perfect camera angle
[5647.38 → 5653.56] or whatever else because what we really want to do is we want to test things and work on things and tell you guys the information you want to know
[5653.56 → 5656.24] uh... and he's better at that
[5656.24 → 5663.14] uh... so, and also we got along really well in the interview so that was one of the other reasons I ended up going with him, although there were at least
[5663.14 → 5666.74] three or four other applicants that honestly I felt terrible
[5666.74 → 5671.96] uh... calling them up and telling them that uh... that they didn't get the job because they would have been
[5671.96 → 5677.18] really, really qualified as well i got a lot of perfect applicants
[5677.18 → 5678.64] uh...
[5678.64 → 5682.64] Linus do you work actively with customers around Vancouver in the NCI shops asks
[5682.64 → 5683.78] Arthur lee
[5683.78 → 5686.62] uh... no I work at a head office
[5686.62 → 5691.78] uh... Mark asks if I can speak French uh... if you put french in front of me
[5691.78 → 5694.58] mighty accent is decent
[5694.58 → 5699.10] uh... however it's been a long time since I've spoken French on a daily basis and all
[5699.10 → 5701.16] lot of it has just disappeared
[5701.16 → 5707.12] uh... if I got immersed again for you know a couple of months that I'd probably be back up to speed but uh...
[5707.12 → 5707.94] right now it's
[5707.94 → 5714.94] pretty rough so I'm not going to try
[5714.94 → 5715.84] uh...
[5715.84 → 5718.74] Sophia asked me to shout out to her brother sound off of it
[5718.74 → 5721.66] he loves my videos high sound
[5721.78 → 5723.78] uh...
[5723.78 → 5729.10] Diaz asks do you visit other NCI stores like Bernabéu and do people recognize you in the supermarket
[5729.10 → 5731.94] that's happened once I was in my full paintball gear
[5731.94 → 5735.02] after a long day of paintball so I looked absolutely terrible
[5735.02 → 5737.98] and some guy walked up to me in superstore of all places
[5737.98 → 5738.78] and was like
[5738.78 → 5739.88] HOI
[5739.88 → 5741.58] you're the NCI YouTube guy
[5741.58 → 5743.58] house like all yeah man hi
[5743.58 → 5745.02] thank you nice to meet you
[5745.02 → 5746.26] and uh...
[5746.26 → 5751.18] and uh... one of the other perfect ones was I was at a badminton tournament when uh...
[5751.18 → 5753.58] some guy like destroyed me
[5753.58 → 5768.58] and uh... me and my partners is a doubles match and at the end of it we go up to the uh... to the net uh... you know shake hands, and you know thanks for you know good game and the guys like all man I had ever since I recognize you on the other side of the court I've wanted to shake your hand is awesome you do those videos I'm like okay
[5768.58 → 5775.58] and it's like embarrassing because now the guy like knows who I am and I just got like crushed in a doubles match and so it's uh...
[5775.58 → 5776.58] uh...
[5776.58 → 5778.58] pretty humiliating but whatever
[5778.58 → 5780.58] it's all good I mean I've gotten more used to it
[5780.58 → 5783.58] uh... it used to be really weird for me
[5783.58 → 5785.50] I think one of maybe the weirdest one still
[5785.50 → 5787.50] was the time that um...
[5787.50 → 5791.50] that I was in a McDonald's and I was actually with the cameraman, and we were getting some food
[5791.50 → 5795.50] and uh... he and I were talking about something totally unrelated to tech tips
[5795.50 → 5798.50] and the guy at the counter turned around
[5798.50 → 5799.50] and went
[5799.50 → 5801.50] is that Linus
[5801.50 → 5802.50] and I was like no way
[5802.50 → 5806.50] he actually recognized me from my voice not from my face which is uh...
[5806.50 → 5810.50] I mean I know I have a bit of a sort of annoying distinctive voice
[5810.50 → 5812.50] since so
[5812.50 → 5815.50] so that was a really weird one
[5815.50 → 5818.50] so that was a really weird one
[5818.50 → 5820.50] and I was like no way
[5820.50 → 5822.50] and I was like no way
[5822.50 → 5823.50] and I was like no way
[5823.50 → 5826.50] I think it's a really weird one
[5826.50 → 5830.50] uh... David asked who's your internet provider and what speed and how much do you pay
[5830.50 → 5834.50] I pay about eighty bucks a month I'm using SHA and I have a fifty megabit down
[5834.50 → 5837.50] I think it's either ten or fifteen megabits up
[5837.50 → 5841.50] um... I needed the better connection for the faster uploads because I'm frequently uploading
[5841.50 → 5843.50] one two gig files
[5843.50 → 5846.50] um... and it was just too slow waiting for the regular broadband connection
[5846.50 → 5849.50] uh... and maybe says can you tweet about these earlier I missed eighty minutes of this one
[5849.50 → 5853.50] mad man i have to tell you I tweeted about this quite a few times over the last few days so make sure you are
[5853.50 → 5857.50] checking your twitter and uh... i also uh...
[5857.50 → 5859.50] uh... I put something in the YouTube feed
[5859.50 → 5860.50] so uh... yeah sorry dude
[5860.50 → 5861.50] uh...
[5861.50 → 5864.50] gotta stay on the ball because I talked about this as not about as much as I can
[5864.50 → 5871.50] uh... without just spamming people all watch the live stream watch the live stream watch the live stream so
[5871.50 → 5875.50] you know I want people to tune in if they wanted to do not tune in because I spammed them
[5875.50 → 5878.50] for the five previous days telling them when the live stream was coming
[5878.50 → 5882.50] Thomas asks does slick live in my house the answer is no
[5882.50 → 5885.50] uh... slick lives uh... about half an hour away from me
[5885.50 → 5887.50] but uh... he ought because he lives
[5887.50 → 5889.50] make he lives here
[5889.50 → 5890.50] and I live here
[5890.50 → 5892.50] and NCI is here
[5892.50 → 5895.50] so he often drives to my house, and then we carpool together to NCI and back
[5895.50 → 5897.50] film a few more videos, and then he goes home so
[5897.50 → 5899.50] so that's why he's often here
[5899.50 → 5901.50] so that's why he's often here
[5901.50 → 5903.50] so that's why he's often here
[5903.50 → 5906.50] so that's why he's often here
[5906.50 → 5909.50] as a baby good thanks for asking the kill
[5909.50 → 5912.50] Alex says you have really waited teeth what's your secret
[5912.50 → 5916.50] um... believe it or not my my my oral hygiene could be better
[5916.50 → 5918.50] um... I only brush my teeth
[5918.50 → 5923.50] uh... I don't like to do anything special I don't use like you know special lighting strips or anything like that
[5923.50 → 5925.50] I use sense of dying
[5925.50 → 5927.50] like the purple one with baking soda
[5927.50 → 5929.50] uh...
[5929.50 → 5930.50] and
[5930.50 → 5931.50] it seems to work
[5931.50 → 5933.50] so they go
[5933.50 → 5936.50] paid product placement for a sense of dying toothpaste
[5936.50 → 5939.50] it's like five dollars a tube though what a scam
[5939.50 → 5940.50] kills me
[5940.50 → 5942.50] I get the big packs at Costco though which helps a little bit
[5942.50 → 5949.50] Brian
[5949.50 → 5951.50] care to talk about your earrings
[5951.50 → 5955.50] I think we are all a bit curious about them and why you chose that style
[5955.50 → 5956.50] I just like them
[5956.50 → 5957.50] um... as for
[5957.50 → 5961.50] as for why I wear uh... as for why I wear hoops
[5961.50 → 5962.50] they're sleepers
[5962.50 → 5965.50] and sleepers are significantly more comfortable because they can spin around
[5965.50 → 5967.50] you can come and sit at your desk and like play with them
[5967.50 → 5970.50] and uh... they don't catch on anything because they don't have
[5970.50 → 5972.50] I don't know how much well you guys are going to be able to see this
[5972.50 → 5974.50] but they don't have an actual hinge
[5974.50 → 5976.50] they're just
[5976.50 → 5979.50] uh... they're just completely round all the way around so the way that they clip together
[5979.50 → 5980.50] for those of you who
[5980.50 → 5982.50] aren't chicks and don't know about earrings
[5982.50 → 5983.50] is uh... is very
[5983.50 → 5984.50] oops
[5984.50 → 5985.50] there's
[5985.50 → 5986.50] oh gross
[5986.50 → 5987.50] there's like skin gunk on it
[5987.50 → 5988.50] sorry for that
[5988.50 → 5991.50] um... so they come together like very cleanly
[5991.50 → 5993.50] and then they come up
[5993.50 → 5994.50] they've got a bit of a clip inside
[5994.50 → 5996.50] so um... they're very comfortable
[5996.50 → 5997.50] um...
[5997.50 → 5999.50] why do I keep the earrings?
[5999.50 → 6000.50] I don't know
[6000.50 → 6001.50] I just like them
[6001.50 → 6024.50] I think this is the works
[6024.50 → 6026.50] of defensiveness
[6026.50 → 6029.08] basically in freaking out for me
[6029.08 → 6031.68] and then I saw a for a free
[6031.68 → 6034.06] or if it did not come across coaching
[6034.06 → 6036.26] on and how to sell your book
[6036.26 → 6039.22] now because I paid a you
[6039.22 → 6040.60] it's very much different
[6040.60 → 6041.36] you're right
[6041.36 → 6043.22] people don't I mean pretty awesome
[6043.22 → 6043.88] anyway
[6043.88 → 6047.80] you know the next option
[6047.80 → 6049.46] can give you one more year
[6049.46 → 6051.34] it turns out all very clean
[6051.34 → 6052.74] somebody won't be mad
[6052.74 → 6054.54] I'm paraglide
[6054.54 → 6064.20] Don't worry too much about it. As for Twitch TV, I mean, I think that even, you know, 2,000 people probably isn't that much for some of the bigger streaming sites.
[6064.48 → 6072.26] So I'd rather, instead of bringing everything outside the Google ecosystem, I prefer to just keep things simpler for myself and use the products that I know how to use.
[6072.60 → 6079.42] Now that I've figured out how to do this whole Hangouts thing, it's not as brutal as it was the first couple times when it was pretty disorganized.
[6079.42 → 6085.42] So I'm going to go ahead and see what I'm going to do with this whole thing.
[6085.42 → 6088.42] Andromeda says, more retro unboxing, please.
[6088.42 → 6092.42] You know what? There's not really any more totally dead stock in the warehouse, otherwise I would.
[6093.42 → 6097.42] That was just some stuff that I randomly found on a shelf, and I was like, oh, I'll unbox it, haha.
[6098.42 → 6102.42] So there isn't really any old stuff there anymore. Sorry, man.
[6103.42 → 6109.42] Ahmed Karma says, what do you think of the Retina Display MacBook Pro? I am so big into dense pixel displays.
[6109.42 → 6117.42] Pixel density is everything to me. I would love to have a MacBook Pro with a Retina Display, but the first thing I do is I'd get OS X off of it, and I'd put it on Windows 7.
[6118.42 → 6136.42] It's a beautiful machine. You know, people who run around and bash Apple saying that it's crap hardware, they don't understand what goes into building a truly beautiful piece of hardware that is solid and well-built, and the only thing I don't like about it is OS X.
[6136.42 → 6143.42] I'd love to have a MacBook. I mean, you know, there's something to be said for this kind of style of device.
[6144.42 → 6160.42] Holy crap, it's like video-caption, right? For this style of device, you know, but you know, you see like that flex, you know, that kind of that cheesiness factor where, you know, it works for me, it works for gamers, but you can't show up at a business meeting with this notebook, guys.
[6160.42 → 6173.42] Like, it's not. It's not right. Travis, I'm building a PC soon. Any tips? Check out my PC build guide. Just search for PC build guide on YouTube. I think I'm the first hit, and those are my tips.
[6173.42 → 6191.42] Wesley wants to know when I'm going to make more videos about my server. Actually, I'm going to be doing a really cool one soon. So I've got two servers now. One of them is the 20 terabyte server that's my home server, and then one of them is an 8 terabyte drive, so I think it works out to about 6 terabytes of actual storage.
[6191.42 → 6215.42] Off-site backup server. So I'm going to show you guys the software configuration, which is only costing me a hundred bucks, that's going to allow me to do nightly sinks from the one server to the other one of my most important data, which means even if someone breaks in and steals my server outright or my house burns down, at least I'll have all of my pictures of my baby and, you know, all my home videos and the stuff that I actually care about somewhere else.
[6215.42 → 6220.42] It'll probably be at, like, my wife's parents' house or my parents' house or something.
[6220.42 → 6243.42] Brock, what's the worst computer experience you've ever had? Oh, man, I wouldn't even be able to begin to tell you because the reality of working with pre-release hardware, with pre-release drivers, and, you know, not having the benefit of being able to Google and see if someone else had the problem because it doesn't exist yet, is that there's no support for problems,
[6243.42 → 6249.42] and problems are frequent at best. Sorry, man, I don't even know.
[6249.42 → 6267.42] Phil Cooper wants to know, are you going to update to a DSLR? Seriously, man, fix that focus. Yes, we'll be getting a better camera at some point. The reality of it is we have a limited budget for tech tips. I try to keep it like a low-cost project, but we will be getting a new camera at some point.
[6267.42 → 6277.42] We thought the Canon AX10 or XA10 or whatever it it was going to be something we could use for everything, but honestly, I hate that thing. It is such a piece of crap. It never remembers our settings.
[6277.42 → 6289.42] The white balance is always all over the place, even though we have it set to a fixed colour temperature. I just hate that camera. So a DSLR is definitely the solution.
[6289.42 → 6299.42] I'm really hoping that I can hold out until I can get something that shoots at 1080p 60fps, but if I can't, then we'll figure out something else sooner.
[6299.42 → 6307.42] Byron, when do you think PC games will start using Intel hyperthreading? They've been using hyperthreading for years.
[6307.42 → 6317.42] Hyperthreading is just leveraging virtual cores, and any game that takes advantage of multiple cores will take advantage of hyperthreading.
[6317.42 → 6323.42] One thing is yourself. I will check out the Raptor Power of Pol predictive mic longtime term and hit an encounter here.
[6323.42 → 6327.42] I can't wait to see ArtPOOOO in mind you are at third party fast.
[6333.42 → 6335.42] Let's move down monitor.
[6335.42 → 6336.42] Wait through.
[6336.42 → 6337.42] dots?
[6337.42 → 6338.42] You got confident.
[6338.42 → 6342.42] But some people get checked out here's it's like, is this great VRI ESO to read heir?
[6342.42 → 6343.32] I am not someone who's happy to read
[6343.32 → 6349.64] really Justin why don't you ask me what's better g4 6 or g4 5
[6349.64 → 6352.64] I'm vertex for is a little bit better
[6352.64 → 6357.02] it's not as much better as we've seen in the past from vertex to vertex 1 in
[6357.02 → 6362.04] 3 to 2, but I'm it's a very reliable drive I can
[6362.04 → 6365.32] say that based on the return data that NCI XC's
[6365.32 → 6369.20] outstanding drives in terms of sheer reliability and I think the
[6369.20 → 6371.14] performance speaks for itself on the vertex 4
[6371.14 → 6374.46] can a 660 Ti hold up
[6374.46 → 6377.76] 3 180 monitors I'm
[6377.76 → 6380.88] physically probably not I'm
[6380.88 → 6384.22] in performance depends what you're playing if you're playing the latest games
[6384.22 → 6388.46] no I'm playing the latest games on 3 1080p monitors get yourself
[6388.46 → 6391.12] dual 680s because that's what it's going to take then
[6391.12 → 6395.90] I'm Quinn will you ever do a text about the Korean panels
[6395.90 → 6400.46] on a sense the X starts selling them because there's no real benefit I don't
[6400.46 → 6403.78] think there's I think it's pretty self-explanatory it's a cheap b-grade
[6403.78 → 6408.08] panel that's cheap and high-res what do you want me to say there's lots of
[6408.08 → 6415.78] reviews on the various forums so yeah Diaz says I have waited for you to reply to me
[6415.78 → 6420.22] could you answer one of them I have posted a lot shouldn't be hard to find here's my
[6420.22 → 6426.96] answer to the one that I did find I have answered one of them yes I will answer it I'm sorry I'm
[6426.96 → 6432.04] answering the most interesting questions that I think will be valid to more users so if yours
[6432.04 → 6434.16] didn't fall under that category then I'm very sorry
[6434.16 → 6439.38] where can you hire both of you on means Lara then what is that related to you guys
[6439.38 → 6441.54] that I have online ή Harald is asking you guys in this ass
[6441.54 → 6444.92] there are no Markite's the variant yeah he isn't a good pick through things
[6445.06 → 6451.28] but so yeah and Nick Morris, and I'm getting customer and she'she
[6451.28 → 6453.86] actually pretty sick of it I'm Joseph it's a good Marianne
[6453.86 → 6457.84] and so you can get it right now as well as we did with Jamie Crus знаю
[6457.84 → 6460.10] for which that covers a resolution for you
[6460.10 → 6467.10] choice
[6468.48 → 6473.22] test tester says just received my maximum pc magazine
[6473.22 → 6475.46] you know the colon d thing
[6475.46 → 6479.40] I'm good for you, I guess really people read magazine still
[6479.40 → 6484.34] are you kidding
[6484.34 → 6487.48] kyle says what do you think is the best case right now
[6487.48 → 6491.20] help yes we cannot hear you, and you put your mic up so about that
[6491.20 → 6494.90] uh... the best case right now is the best case that there's ever been the
[6494.90 → 6498.86] Silverstone TJ o seven and people might not agree with me but I don't care
[6498.86 → 6500.86] because they don't have a YouTube channel
[6500.86 → 6503.44] they can make a YouTube channel they can make videos about how they don't like
[6503.44 → 6506.62] the TJ o seven but no one will watch them because the TJ o sevens the best case
[6506.62 → 6507.34] ever
[6507.34 → 6509.34] TJ elevens just a little bit too big
[6509.34 → 6510.64] cosmos two is
[6510.64 → 6513.16] honestly not that well laid out it under d is
[6513.16 → 6516.34] fairly low cost steel construction compared to the aluminum construction
[6516.34 → 6520.06] of the TJ o seven you know there are lots of cases that people really like war
[6520.06 → 6522.64] keyboard warrior better than two years seven you know it
[6522.64 → 6525.62] once you spend the money on the TJ o seven which I have to
[6525.62 → 6527.24] do things like powder coat it
[6527.24 → 6529.00] you know you've got a couple holes in it
[6529.00 → 6530.40] uh... it's untouchable
[6530.40 → 6533.72] because you can get a quad rat in the bottom you can get
[6533.72 → 6537.06] uh... you do a rat in the front which is all the water cooling you really need
[6537.06 → 6538.30] and it's just
[6538.30 → 6540.64] uh... it's just beautiful
[6540.64 → 6542.76] absolutely beautiful you know the
[6542.76 → 6547.30] the unibody aluminum design that used to be better actually the newer ones use
[6547.30 → 6549.48] like a scoring process
[6549.48 → 6550.66] that the curve
[6550.66 → 6554.20] uh... for that single piece of aluminum that does the top the front the bottom
[6554.20 → 6557.08] uh... whereas the older ones were straight bent
[6557.08 → 6560.10] so it was smoother and I have one of the older ones so
[6560.10 → 6564.80] I pretty much you can't buy what I think is the best case ever
[6564.80 → 6570.00] things like case labs and mountain mods are too big for me
[6570.00 → 6574.56] uh...
[6574.56 → 6575.82] let's see what else we got
[6575.82 → 6579.24] Eric he seemed very busy to have time to play games at all
[6579.24 → 6582.46] hardly at all these days most of the gaming I get in is uh...
[6582.46 → 6587.24] when I'm benchmarking games for like video card reviews
[6587.24 → 6588.20] uh...
[6588.20 → 6591.38] uh... Luke says I'm about to spend eight hundred dollars on it line is what
[6591.38 → 6593.58] performance to expect from a single
[6593.58 → 6597.32] GTX sixty eighty-four gig over surround on ultra with no antialiasing
[6597.32 → 6600.92] really depends on the game, and you're spending way too much on that six eighty
[6600.92 → 6604.56] uh... for that kind of price you can almost get a couple of six seventy-four
[6604.56 → 6609.48] gigs which would give you way better performance Luke
[6609.48 → 6610.56] uh...
[6610.56 → 6614.56] uh...
[6614.56 → 6620.04] mark CHO asks what's faster Usain Bolt or a thirty-seven seventy k
[6620.04 → 6622.70] uh...
[6622.70 → 6625.04] probably you have seen bolt
[6625.04 → 6628.22] because I've never seen thirty-seven seventy k do much of anything I mean thirty
[6628.22 → 6629.36] seven seventy k
[6629.36 → 6631.26] isn't much faster than this SD card
[6631.26 → 6632.98] look how fast it is
[6632.98 → 6634.72] so even moving at all
[6634.72 → 6641.72] useless
[6641.72 → 6645.76] uh...
[6645.76 → 6649.54] no Maquis says could you briefly explain why it should switch me BG eight here big
[6649.54 → 6650.32] three
[6650.32 → 6653.54] uh... well on the video card side it makes less of a difference than motherboards
[6653.54 → 6656.70] because motherboards it comes down to the bios' implementation more than the
[6656.70 → 6657.50] hardware
[6657.50 → 6661.98] so you know someone actually VG is a great example of fantastic hardware on the
[6661.98 → 6662.92] other boards
[6662.92 → 6666.06] and I've never been that impressed with the software side
[6666.06 → 6669.66] uh... whereas the big three have been doing this a really long time they're really
[6669.66 → 6672.90] experienced their teams are outstanding and that's why I stick with them from
[6672.90 → 6674.00] motherboards
[6674.00 → 6678.06] uh... as for why I would explain why you should switch me BG eight of the big
[6678.06 → 6678.70] three
[6678.70 → 6681.54] I would ask you to explain to me why you would
[6681.54 → 6684.00] go with an egg a video card over the big three
[6684.00 → 6686.22] there's nothing wrong with an egg a video card
[6686.22 → 6689.06] there's nothing wrong with an Asus video card
[6689.06 → 6690.36] uh...
[6690.36 → 6693.68] so i just I don't know it's up to you ultimately egg is not manufacturing
[6693.68 → 6695.80] anything I hope you guys know that uh...
[6695.80 → 6700.44] the true manufacturers are at the pc partners of the world so that's your
[6700.44 → 6702.68] uh... your sapphire is an attack
[6702.68 → 6707.72] uh... pine which is SFX uh... issues which is
[6707.72 → 6712.62] issues gigabyte and MSI these are true manufacturers uh...
[6712.62 → 6715.80] galaxy's a true manufacturer as well
[6715.80 → 6719.98] and uh...
[6719.98 → 6722.62] the pc partner yeah yeah that's uh... that's a tech
[6722.62 → 6724.18] uh... wait no maybe not
[6724.18 → 6727.56] maybe this I think I can remember anymore but uh... yeah maybe he doesn't
[6727.56 → 6729.48] manufacture anything so
[6729.48 → 6730.48] uh... it's just something to
[6730.48 → 6731.58] to think about
[6731.58 → 6735.46] uh... as for why I would recommend it was a specific card you know for a six
[6735.46 → 6736.84] sixty ti for example
[6736.84 → 6739.70] I would go with the MSI one specifically because it has better over
[6739.70 → 6744.20] voting options than any other six sixty ti whether it's egg a or Asus or gigabyte
[6744.20 → 6746.10] who are members of the big three
[6746.10 → 6749.16] so uh... it really comes down to the individual product and what you're trying
[6749.16 → 6751.12] to get out of it
[6751.12 → 6755.12] uh... how much does overclocking actually help asks Brandon
[6755.12 → 6757.80] like for the two hundred megahertz you said you could get from that card how much
[6757.80 → 6758.90] does that help
[6758.90 → 6762.26] well it's a pretty simple calculation if your GPU bound in the game, and you go
[6762.26 → 6765.38] from one gigahertz to one point two gigahertz you'll probably get anywhere
[6765.38 → 6766.62] from about a
[6766.62 → 6770.36] twelve to twenty percent performance improvement
[6770.36 → 6774.56] you have to decide if it's worth it, it costs you nothing so
[6774.56 → 6778.38] Salem asked what time it is it's almost midnight so I think we really are done
[6778.38 → 6781.92] at midnight and I've said that a few times, but people keep like tuning in and
[6781.92 → 6784.56] they keep watching so it's like well I don't want to go away if you guys are
[6784.56 → 6785.86] still watching
[6785.86 → 6790.24] uh... but at some point I do have to do it
[6790.24 → 6793.18] uh...
[6793.18 → 6795.32] to do
[6795.32 → 6797.56] show rocket or rumble you know what I don't know where they are they're
[6797.56 → 6802.32] probably sleeping I'm not going to bother them it's really
[6802.32 → 6805.76] uh... mark have you considered Hackintosh in your machine using final cut for
[6805.76 → 6809.84] your editing tasks are yes and at some point i will build a Hackintosh
[6809.84 → 6813.06] and I will try out uh... I will try out final cut
[6813.06 → 6814.10] but uh...
[6814.10 → 6815.58] i just gotta get around to it
[6815.58 → 6818.98] what I really want to do is I want to do it in that prodigy case and uh... Asus says
[6818.98 → 6820.36] they shipped me
[6820.36 → 6824.80] uh... the p AZ seventy-seven i deluxe their it board today
[6824.80 → 6827.82] so I'm super excited about that I can't wait to actually get that done I know i
[6827.82 → 6834.82] promise that double long time ago
[6834.82 → 6838.56] jack are you excited for Microsoft Surface absolutely
[6838.56 → 6842.10] uh... I'm excited just because it's something truly new and innovative and
[6842.10 → 6845.62] different from Microsoft is doing I mean for so long
[6845.62 → 6848.98] they've maintained the status quo and I think they've been afraid to do something
[6848.98 → 6849.72] different
[6849.72 → 6854.46] but truly different I mean the start menu was different back in window at back in
[6854.46 → 6856.46] 1995
[6856.46 → 6859.46] and uh... I think this will be the first time they've done something actually that
[6859.46 → 6861.46] different again
[6861.46 → 6865.46] uh... with the metro but not metro, but you know not yet named interface and I'm not
[6865.46 → 6870.46] I'm very excited to use it and I'm not going to form my opinion based on my first ten minutes
[6870.46 → 6871.46] and that is using it
[6871.46 → 6875.46] what I have to do is I have to get a proper device with a touchscreen sit down and use it
[6875.46 → 6877.46] for a long time and then decide because
[6877.46 → 6878.46] and then decide because
[6878.46 → 6880.46] at first I hated the updated start menu for example in Windows XP
[6880.46 → 6884.46] or was it Windows XP news vista whenever they updated the start menu
[6884.46 → 6888.46] to from the original design to the double width
[6888.46 → 6892.46] and then once i just sort of forced myself to use it I found out all no actually they
[6892.46 → 6895.46] sort of probably did a lot of research on this because it's way better
[6895.46 → 6898.46] uh... and I'm at the point now where I only use uh...
[6898.46 → 6899.46] uh...
[6899.46 → 6902.46] I don't know maybe twenty applications on my computer so
[6902.46 → 6904.46] I mean given a use steam to launch every game
[6904.46 → 6906.46] and you know I've got like office lake
[6906.46 → 6909.46] my video editing software there's not much beyond that so
[6909.46 → 6910.46] do I actually need
[6910.46 → 6917.46] anything other than like sort of a tiled layout that I can sort of scroll between and click on something is that actually slower I don't know so I'll try it out
[6917.46 → 6921.46] Devin wants to know what I think of the fifteen hundred wight VGA power supply
[6921.46 → 6924.46] I think it's a fifteen hundred watt power supply power supplies our power supplies
[6924.46 → 6926.46] uh...
[6926.46 → 6931.46] I go with the one that has good efficiency and has like nice cables and uh... looks good
[6931.46 → 6932.46] you know
[6932.46 → 6936.46] uh... and johnny guru of course will do reviews that actually analyze the performance of it
[6936.46 → 6940.46] so basically doesn't matter what I think it matters what he thinks or Oklahoma wolf is the one doing it
[6940.46 → 6943.46] a lot of things that you can do it
[6943.46 → 6950.46] uh...
[6950.46 → 6954.46] all right there's enough people asking for rocket or rumble I'll go look for the cat okay because
[6954.46 → 6956.46] we're going to know pretty quick and all that
[6956.46 → 6959.46] I don't want to just ignore you guys
[6959.46 → 6962.46] but
[6962.46 → 6965.46] uh...
[6965.46 → 6968.46] uh...
[6968.46 → 6970.46] uh...
[6970.46 → 6973.46] uh...
[6973.46 → 6989.46] uh...
[6989.46 → 6991.46] uh...
[6992.46 → 6993.46] uh...
[6993.46 → 6996.46] uh...
[6996.46 → 7005.64] Oh, there he is.
[7011.28 → 7013.84] Poor guy was sleeping, and I bothered him.
[7014.26 → 7018.34] So you can see he's pretty agitated, and he wants to go back to bed.
[7018.78 → 7023.36] But here's Rocket, and he's pretty cute.
[7023.36 → 7026.36] I'm going to get him to...
[7026.46 → 7029.56] Say hi.
[7030.86 → 7032.12] I hope you guys can hear me.
[7032.50 → 7033.00] Say hi.
[7033.86 → 7037.16] Yeah, you can see he's really wanting to go somewhere else.
[7037.54 → 7039.60] So here, I'll see if he'll sit with me for a little bit.
[7039.98 → 7040.72] Rumble, get down.
[7040.92 → 7041.10] Hey.
[7042.08 → 7043.26] He's not allowed on the counter.
[7043.44 → 7044.72] He was going up on the counter.
[7045.26 → 7047.96] So let's see if we can get a few more questions going here.
[7048.42 → 7052.30] Here, I'll tilt it down, because I know you guys want to see the cat more than you want to see me anyway at this point.
[7052.30 → 7056.16] All right.
[7056.24 → 7057.28] Scrolling back up to the top.
[7057.36 → 7059.58] Let's see if we've got a few more questions to answer.
[7064.20 → 7065.70] You guys freaking serious?
[7066.80 → 7069.40] There's no way I can keep up with you.
[7069.40 → 7072.66] No way I can keep up with you.
[7073.82 → 7074.54] Oh, man.
[7075.14 → 7076.36] Linus, posting it again.
[7076.36 → 7083.52] IX slash Bulldozer versus Leon Option and Squadron Fire Pro versus GeForce Radeon.
[7083.94 → 7086.78] Which one and which circumstances?
[7087.34 → 7090.18] Well, for consumer use, you want to use consumer products.
[7090.32 → 7092.86] And for workstation use, you want to use workstation products.
[7093.00 → 7094.22] So that's not really rocket science.
[7095.20 → 7097.30] Byron asks what kind of car do you have?
[7097.40 → 7099.20] I drive a Honda Civic 2003.
[7099.90 → 7100.80] Manual, of course.
[7100.80 → 7104.80] Kevin.
[7106.00 → 7108.06] Mr. Sebastian, pancakes or waffles?
[7108.66 → 7111.28] And I would refer you to my favourite song, which goes,
[7112.10 → 7112.80] Do you like pancakes?
[7113.48 → 7114.66] Yeah, we like pancakes.
[7114.82 → 7116.08] Do you like French toast?
[7116.20 → 7116.82] Yeah, we like...
[7116.82 → 7117.00] No.
[7117.14 → 7117.66] Is it waffles?
[7118.24 → 7118.80] Do you like...
[7118.80 → 7119.08] I don't know.
[7119.14 → 7119.34] Whatever.
[7119.42 → 7120.18] It's on Newgrounds.
[7120.62 → 7121.88] Anyway, Rocket wants to go now.
[7122.08 → 7125.18] So sorry for subjecting you guys to that.
[7127.08 → 7130.34] So we'll go back to me since he's gone back to his nap.
[7130.34 → 7132.48] Rumble's still hanging around here.
[7133.10 → 7133.74] There he is.
[7134.16 → 7134.56] Hey, Rumble.
[7135.88 → 7136.58] Hi, sweetheart.
[7137.40 → 7138.22] Say hi, everyone.
[7141.94 → 7142.40] Hold on.
[7142.46 → 7143.46] I'll see if I can get him to meow.
[7144.40 → 7144.80] Meow.
[7146.18 → 7146.54] Hey.
[7147.44 → 7147.88] Meow.
[7150.40 → 7150.84] Meow.
[7153.84 → 7154.24] Hey.
[7154.94 → 7155.34] Meow.
[7158.02 → 7158.96] Oh, he's not in the mood.
[7158.96 → 7160.26] Sorry, guys.
[7160.28 → 7160.84] He's not in the mood.
[7161.28 → 7163.04] Usually he'll talk to me if I talk to him.
[7163.58 → 7168.58] And I'm sorry for being such a cat lady here, but I am what I am.
[7171.42 → 7171.78] Okay.
[7171.88 → 7172.62] Moving down.
[7175.82 → 7178.26] Does the size of the motherboard make a difference in performance?
[7178.44 → 7179.16] The answer is no.
[7181.00 → 7186.22] Especially these days with so many high-performance IT boards that can, you know, overclock to the moon and back.
[7186.22 → 7202.32] Joseph wants to know, how do you tell what version of PCIe your motherboard is if it has no indication?
[7202.54 → 7203.84] Usually you can tell by the platform.
[7203.84 → 7208.98] So if you have a P55 motherboard, for example, your PCIe is 2.0.
[7209.74 → 7210.22] That simple.
[7211.30 → 7214.92] Plus Giant wants to know, what are the big three that you mentioned when talking about VGA?
[7215.38 → 7217.16] Asus, Gigabyte, and Asia.
[7217.24 → 7218.24] Those are the big three.
[7218.38 → 7219.24] Those are the tier ones.
[7219.24 → 7227.64] Tor Mundy says, you mentioned the double size bar on Windows 7.
[7227.72 → 7229.54] You can make it regular old school size and properties.
[7230.04 → 7234.74] And I did that for a long time until I realized that, you know, maybe I'll just try it.
[7234.78 → 7235.70] Maybe I'll just give it a shot.
[7235.80 → 7237.74] And then I found out I liked the double width one better.
[7237.86 → 7238.78] So I no longer care.
[7238.78 → 7251.62] Michael, do you ever think about having JJ on an episode?
[7251.88 → 7252.06] Sure.
[7252.20 → 7254.74] He's more than welcome to come join us on an episode.
[7255.30 → 7260.34] I think part of the reason that he does so many episodes on New egg TV is that he works down the street.
[7260.82 → 7267.58] So it's a lot more convenient for him, whereas he would actually have to fly up here in order to hang out with me.
[7267.58 → 7274.40] And I'm not that fun to hang out with, although 2,100 people would say otherwise, apparently.
[7275.14 → 7275.88] Which is cool.
[7276.08 → 7278.08] Thank you guys for all checking out the stream.
[7278.20 → 7279.02] So you know what?
[7279.12 → 7279.70] It's midnight.
[7280.38 → 7284.46] So I think we're going to call it quits at this point in time.
[7285.36 → 7287.28] And so I'll answer one last question.
[7287.40 → 7289.94] Bobby Pope, you can be the last question of the night.
[7290.56 → 7292.48] Do you have a home theatre PC?
[7292.62 → 7294.24] And if not, what's keeping you from building one?
[7294.32 → 7295.70] I do have a home theatre PC.
[7295.70 → 7303.42] I have an awesome, silent IT home theatre PC and a PC Q07 from Liam Lee.
[7303.66 → 7313.30] It's using a Total LGA1156 mini IT P55 board and a core i5 dual-core with the onboard video.
[7313.42 → 7318.96] And then I have like a TV tuner in there that I don't really use anymore because analog TV is totally irrelevant now.
[7318.96 → 7326.42] And I use it to play like emulated ZS and ES games on my TV and to stream media from my home server.
[7326.42 → 7329.94] So good night everyone.
[7330.52 → 7331.76] And thank you for watching.
[7331.98 → 7334.72] And Minecraft Freak is like spamming me.
[7335.06 → 7336.22] What's a good gaming laptop?
[7336.52 → 7338.76] The one with the good spec and the low price.
[7338.88 → 7339.30] Come on, man.
[7340.28 → 7341.22] What do you want me to say?
[7341.32 → 7343.90] There are only a few brands out there that make gaming laptops at all.
[7344.02 → 7345.24] Asus, MSI, Lenovo.
[7345.30 → 7345.76] They're all good.
[7345.82 → 7346.20] What do you want?
[7346.54 → 7347.32] Like, I don't know.
[7347.74 → 7350.54] Find the one that you like that looks good to you and then buy it.
[7350.54 → 7353.24] Bye, everybody.
