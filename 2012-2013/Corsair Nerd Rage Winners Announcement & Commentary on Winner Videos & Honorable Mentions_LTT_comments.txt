How much rage do you think it took to do that to a keyboard? Have you ever seen Law Abiding Citizen? I'm pretty sure that was the reference he was making. For context two goons kill his wife and kid in front of the guy, then he does that to one of them later in the movie.

Trust me. The rage was strong with that one.

I'm sorry the judging panel didn't really enjoy your video. Any one of the judges was allowed to nominate the honourable mentions. I hope you at least enjoyed making the video though!

The contest was "nerd rage", not "keyboard rage".

His video was hilarious. Disgusting and unnecessarily dangours, but hilarious :p
