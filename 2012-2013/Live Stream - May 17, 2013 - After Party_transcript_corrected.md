[0.00 → 4.48] Hopefully this is it now. Are we good? Are we good?
[8.80 → 14.40] Alright, you know what? We're probably just gonna kind of live with that. I hope.
[15.76 → 17.44] Okay, fortress time.
[23.68 → 25.36] I'm probably not going to be able to beat this.
[30.00 → 34.16] Someone wants us to plug in the road mic. Yeah, well...
[36.56 → 39.44] Yeah, we don't actually have that capability right now.
[41.44 → 45.92] Yeah, honestly, we'll... once we're moved into the new place,
[45.92 → 48.72] we will set up a better solution for streaming.
[51.20 → 56.40] Why do I keep doing this? I keep running ahead in this fortress, and it doesn't work.
[56.40 → 61.60] But yeah, we'll have something a lot more permanent that we can...
[65.60 → 68.08] I know, I keep doing it. I can never wait.
[68.08 → 69.68] It's okay.
[71.68 → 73.12] It says game audio loud.
[76.48 → 76.80] Okay.
[80.32 → 81.36] Are you stopping it?
[81.36 → 82.72] No, no. Keep going.
[82.72 → 88.88] I'm just turning off the sound box.
[102.40 → 103.60] What are you trying?
[103.60 → 106.08] I'm just turning off the sound box, so I'm all working.
[106.08 → 106.40] Okay.
[106.40 → 106.96] Okay.
[106.96 → 108.56] Is, uh, my boost on?
[108.56 → 114.64] I don't think so.
[114.64 → 117.92] Because it's in... right now it's in podcast mode.
[117.92 → 120.96] So it's supposed to be a little bit closer to us than I think it is.
[122.16 → 125.04] So I expected it to be quiet.
[126.32 → 126.80] Oh, well, yeah.
[126.80 → 128.08] Oh, your butt was coming to me.
[130.88 → 132.32] I'm expecting it to be a little bit quiet,
[132.32 → 133.68] but everyone's saying it's too loud, right?
[133.68 → 143.60] Yeah, it's like actually not helpful with so many people saying it's good and so many people saying it's not good.
[143.60 → 144.64] Do you want to just tune in?
[145.92 → 146.64] Yeah, I'll do it.
[148.08 → 149.84] Because, yeah, this is kind of ridiculous.
[149.84 → 150.48] I'm sorry, guys.
[150.48 → 154.40] We can't trust you because you don't actually tell us what's going on.
[155.12 → 155.68] Yeah.
[155.68 → 162.24] Half of Twitch chat is trolling us and the other half is trying to tell us what's actually going on.
[162.24 → 165.52] So we can't do anything to fix things if we don't get proper feedback.
[169.84 → 171.12] So, yeah.
[171.68 → 173.12] Don't know what to tell you.
[185.68 → 200.24] I think I've done it without that one.
[200.24 → 201.52] I am.
[204.40 → 205.60] Someone's like, it's getting...
[205.60 → 207.28] Oh, I wasn't even looking.
[207.28 → 209.28] There's one right there?
[209.28 → 210.16] Yeah.
[210.16 → 212.16] Someone's like, oh, it's getting worse.
[212.16 → 212.72] I can't...
[212.72 → 213.20] I don't...
[213.20 → 216.40] I don't understand what could possibly be making it worse at this point.
[216.40 → 217.36] Your...
[217.36 → 218.40] Or what?
[218.40 → 220.80] Is it your laptop fan that it wants to hear?
[220.80 → 221.84] No, I don't think so.
[221.84 → 222.64] It's quite loud.
[225.28 → 226.40] Okay, are you recording it?
[226.40 → 227.20] I don't know, sir.
[228.80 → 229.76] I guess it's fine.
[235.52 → 236.40] Okay, so how are we doing?
[237.44 → 238.96] What seems to be the problem, sir?
[238.96 → 240.96] I don't know.
[240.96 → 243.36] Okay, so how are we doing now?
[243.36 → 243.84] Ooh.
[244.48 → 244.96] Terrible.
[244.96 → 245.44] So what is it?
[247.44 → 248.00] Here, hold on.
[249.68 → 252.56] If I reposition this, is it still pulling audio from the weapon?
[253.60 → 254.64] No, I don't think so.
[258.96 → 259.44] Wow.
[259.44 → 260.64] I just lost all audio.
[260.64 → 262.64] I don't know.
[268.72 → 269.60] Alright, we'll be back.
[275.76 → 276.56] Oh, hey.
[276.56 → 276.88] What?
[276.88 → 278.08] Are we good now?
[280.32 → 281.04] What was the problem?
[283.52 → 284.16] Are we good now?
[284.16 → 285.28] I think we're good now.
[285.28 → 286.16] Okay, what was the problem?
[287.44 → 288.64] I think it's in the wrong mode.
[288.64 → 290.56] Oh, for crying out loud.
[291.28 → 292.00] Okay, well, you're up.
[293.68 → 294.24] Is it?
[294.24 → 295.04] Wait, is it?
[295.04 → 295.76] Let it catch up.
[295.76 → 296.48] It's not caught up.
[296.48 → 298.08] I'm going to change it.
[298.08 → 298.48] I don't know.
[298.48 → 300.48] The voices are apparently too quiet.
[300.48 → 301.52] But I don't know what to do about that.
[301.52 → 303.36] I already want to turn it up all the way over.
[303.36 → 304.08] That's what I mean.
[304.08 → 305.60] The clearest mode is podcast mode.
[305.60 → 306.80] I must have put it in the wrong direction.
[306.80 → 307.84] I thought I put it in the wrong direction.
[307.84 → 309.68] Okay, why don't we just move it closer?
[309.68 → 310.40] That might be.
[312.08 → 312.96] Alright, guys.
[312.96 → 314.56] How are the voices now?
[314.56 → 315.92] Are they to your satisfaction?
[315.92 → 317.04] I can take a little bit.
[317.04 → 318.24] Someone's like turned down game.
[318.24 → 319.68] Do you want to turn down game button?
[328.08 → 328.56] Alright.
[329.52 → 330.88] Maybe we're finally good.
[333.60 → 334.96] We're like, it's still too quiet.
[334.96 → 343.76] I don't know what to do about it being too quiet when we already have the slider at max.
[346.72 → 347.12] Okay?
[347.12 → 348.16] A lot of people are saying perfect now.
[348.16 → 350.16] Remember, the stream is very delayed right now.
[350.16 → 350.72] I don't know.
[350.72 → 350.96] Okay.
[350.96 → 354.16] So, pretty sure that's all we can do.
[354.16 → 354.64] Alright, you're up.
[354.64 → 355.76] A lot of people are saying it's perfect.
[355.76 → 356.16] Go.
[356.16 → 357.68] We can all watch me down.
[357.68 → 359.60] Now I want to actually play video games.
[360.80 → 364.88] So, speaking of playing video games, big news from Nintendo this week.
[367.76 → 369.60] The fact that we're streaming a Nintendo game.
[369.60 → 370.00] Oh!
[370.00 → 371.20] Yeah.
[371.20 → 384.40] So, someone mentioned this on Twitter during the live stream where Nintendo is looking for game
[384.40 → 391.20] streamers who are streaming their games, and they are monetizing those other people's content.
[391.20 → 397.84] Now, the justification for it, so they're claiming the content, so the justification for it is that the
[397.84 → 406.32] game streamers are profiting from Nintendo's IP, so from Nintendo's work, because they're doing these
[406.32 → 409.12] game streams which they obviously can't do without a game.
[410.16 → 410.48] Okay?
[410.48 → 416.56] So, then the flip side of that is that the game streamers are kind of going, well, it's basically
[416.56 → 423.28] free advertising for your game if we do this, so I don't understand why there's a problem with this
[423.28 → 428.16] and why we're having this conversation where you're instead of allowing me to make money by
[428.16 → 431.84] generating free publicity for your game, you are taking the money from me.
[431.84 → 434.00] Are you really that strapped for cash?
[434.64 → 437.44] And I actually take a bit of a different stance on it.
[437.44 → 444.32] So, what we're doing right now I actually don't think is something that they're claiming where it's our...
[444.32 → 444.88] Wait, wait, wait.
[444.88 → 445.52] What does this mean?
[445.52 → 447.36] I can't remember.
[447.36 → 448.56] Should I hit it or...
[448.56 → 448.96] I don't know.
[450.08 → 452.00] I'd take it over there and find out what it does first.
[454.80 → 457.52] Oh, so there's a one up, but it also drops another obstacle.
[459.04 → 459.52] Yay!
[460.16 → 462.08] There's a, uh, there's a feather there.
[463.36 → 466.96] So, okay, so there are two ways that this is being looked at.
[466.96 → 472.16] One is that the game streamers, uh, is that Nintendo's the game streamers a favour,
[472.16 → 479.44] or the game streamers are doing Nintendo a favour just by streaming the game and generating additional exposure for it.
[479.44 → 484.32] Um, with the flip side being that especially things like Lets Plays...
[484.32 → 486.16] Watch this is so bad.
[486.16 → 488.00] If someone just watches a Lets Plays...
[488.00 → 488.96] If someone just watches a Lets Plays...
[488.96 → 492.72] Especially with games these days that aren't really based on difficulty and replayability,
[492.72 → 493.84] but are based on a story...
[493.84 → 498.00] If you just watch a Let's Play, are you actually going to buy the game at all?
[498.00 → 498.64] No!
[498.64 → 505.28] Are you really generating any additional publicity and sales for Nintendo, or are you actually making things worse for them?
[505.28 → 506.24] Yeah, so...
[506.24 → 506.80] So...
[506.80 → 507.36] So...
[507.36 → 509.36] So...
[509.36 → 510.36] So...
[510.36 → 511.36] Yeah...
[511.36 → 514.56] I don't know.
[514.56 → 515.60] What's your take on this?
[515.60 → 516.96] I don't like it.
[516.96 → 519.68] I take the stance of most streamers.
[519.68 → 521.92] Um, because...
[521.92 → 523.52] You're...
[523.52 → 524.88] But you bought the game.
[524.88 → 525.60] Yes.
[525.60 → 526.48] You bought the game.
[526.48 → 527.36] It is yours.
[527.36 → 528.00] You are now...
[528.00 → 529.92] And yes, you're streaming other people's content.
[529.92 → 535.20] And yes, with Lets Plays and stuff, they are getting part of that experience and may not buy the game.
[535.20 → 535.76] Yes.
[535.76 → 540.96] But I think most of the people that are going to watch the game instead of buy the game are people that probably can't afford the game.
[540.96 → 541.44] Sure.
[541.44 → 545.60] And you're getting free advertising where a lot of people are going to watch the game a little bit and be like,
[545.60 → 547.28] Okay, this is something I actually want to buy.
[547.28 → 547.68] Okay.
[547.68 → 548.88] A lot of games don't have demos.
[548.88 → 549.68] Okay.
[549.68 → 550.96] And then they might go out and buy the game.
[550.96 → 551.68] Okay, so I'm gonna...
[551.68 → 551.92] Here.
[551.92 → 553.04] I'm going to flip it around.
[553.04 → 553.36] Okay?
[553.36 → 556.88] Does the game not have a demo because the dev decided they didn't want to do a demo?
[558.32 → 558.88] So there's...
[558.88 → 559.36] Okay.
[559.36 → 559.84] So there's that.
[559.84 → 560.48] Possibly.
[560.48 → 561.04] Next up...
[561.04 → 562.16] Can you flip the thing?
[562.16 → 562.56] Oh, sorry.
[562.56 → 563.68] Next up...
[563.68 → 566.72] What if I'm watching a movie where I'm generating my own content?
[566.72 → 570.96] Because that's one of the arguments I hear is that the streamers are adding their own content to the content.
[570.96 → 571.28] Yes.
[571.28 → 576.24] So you can see this content here in our corner and then there's Nintendo's content over there.
[576.24 → 579.60] Um, so the fact that we're adding our own content to it, does that make it okay?
[579.60 → 585.28] What if I just uploaded movies to YouTube with myself in the corner talking about the movie?
[585.28 → 589.44] Um, am I creating my own content at that point?
[589.44 → 590.56] Interesting.
[590.56 → 596.80] And then the flip side being public exhibition of content has been illegal for the longest time.
[596.80 → 598.00] It's not like that's a new thing.
[598.00 → 598.80] That's true.
[598.80 → 599.84] Those are both good points.
[599.84 → 600.40] I think it's...
[600.40 → 601.28] All three good points.
[601.28 → 602.00] All three good points.
[602.00 → 603.68] Um, I don't know if...
[604.88 → 608.72] I feel the same way about movies as I do about games, but I don't know how you could justify this important.
[608.72 → 610.32] Apparently game audio is still too loud.
[610.32 → 612.32] Is there anything you can...
[612.32 → 613.52] I keep watching the...
[613.52 → 614.80] Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[614.80 → 617.68] Um, I don't know the voice of game.
[619.12 → 620.08] We've turned it down and off.
[620.08 → 620.80] Okay, hold on, hold on.
[620.80 → 622.16] I think I can turn it down on here.
[622.96 → 623.28] Okay.
[623.28 → 624.48] Oh no, no, I can't turn it down.
[624.48 → 626.80] No, because it's this source.
[626.80 → 628.40] So I need to turn it down here.
[634.00 → 634.24] There.
[634.24 → 636.08] That's the last time I'm adjusting the volume.
[636.08 → 637.20] I don't care anymore.
[637.20 → 637.76] Okay, you're up.
[637.76 → 640.88] Okay, so what were we talking about?
[642.24 → 644.08] Right, public streaming of content.
[644.08 → 645.36] Wow, I don't remember this at all.
[645.36 → 646.56] Hello, Mr. Random Man.
[646.56 → 647.52] Can I jump on his head?
[647.52 → 649.68] Yep, but then he turns into a fire reading one.
[649.68 → 651.04] So you have to pop him again.
[651.04 → 651.68] Right.
[652.72 → 653.68] Someone's like too low now.
[653.68 → 654.64] Whatever, I don't care anymore.
[658.88 → 660.56] Oh, I forget what these guys are called.
[660.56 → 662.00] Like Rex or something?
[662.00 → 666.24] Oh, and if you spin jump the big ones, then it's a one hit.
[666.24 → 667.76] Oh.
[667.76 → 668.16] Yeah.
[668.64 → 669.36] And it's a one hit.
[670.80 → 673.12] Did you just pop two at the same time?
[673.12 → 673.52] Yes.
[673.52 → 675.20] Apparently audio is perfect now.
[675.20 → 675.76] So there you go.
[675.76 → 677.44] Yay, we're with audio.
[677.44 → 682.72] I really am looking forward to when we have a proper streaming setup that we actually don't touch.
[682.72 → 683.36] Yeah.
[683.36 → 683.44] Yeah.
[683.44 → 683.84] Yeah.
[683.84 → 685.36] Or at least don't touch much.
[685.36 → 685.84] Yeah.
[685.84 → 687.44] This was completely torn down.
[687.44 → 687.84] Yeah.
[687.84 → 693.44] Because this is in the middle of my living room where, trust me guys, my wife does not want it.
[694.56 → 701.92] We're on the couch and then there's like my coffee table right in front of me that has a CRT monitor and a webcam on it.
[701.92 → 711.12] And then there's like the snowball sitting next to the CRT and then there's a laptop sitting next to the CRT.
[711.12 → 716.40] And then we're actually streaming from my media PC, which is way up there.
[716.40 → 718.40] So that's where we're monitoring the stream from.
[720.40 → 720.80] Nice.
[720.80 → 722.16] You've got your own firepower.
[722.16 → 722.64] Oh.
[722.64 → 729.60] So anyway, I'm going to go ahead and pop up the Twitch chat, and I'd like to hear what you guys think about the whole Nintendo thing.
[729.60 → 737.04] Because one of the responses that I've seen from the streamers or people who are on the streamer's side in all this is,
[738.72 → 742.08] Well, I'm just not going to stream Nintendo games anymore if they're going to monetize the content.
[742.08 → 742.72] Yep.
[742.72 → 747.68] I'm not going to do them any favours. Whereas that assumes that Nintendo feels like it's a favour in the first place.
[748.56 → 756.88] Yeah. I think, uh, wasn't there an official state, I vaguely remember reading something about Nintendo saying that they didn't actually want people to stop streaming.
[758.08 → 759.52] Of course they don't if they're pulling an advert from it.
[759.52 → 760.96] Because they're going to take money from it.
[760.96 → 764.88] Yeah. If they're the ones monetizing the content then, yeah.
[764.88 → 767.20] Holy crap. Dolores.
[769.04 → 769.36] Wow.
[769.36 → 773.28] Uh, oh yeah, that's one way of doing it.
[773.28 → 775.92] You've got to be pretty careful though. He'll stay right on top of you.
[777.04 → 778.64] I've never actually tried this before.
[780.48 → 780.96] Woo!
[780.96 → 782.80] Whoa! Okay.
[782.80 → 785.52] There was definitely some sprite overlap going on there.
[787.28 → 788.32] I'm not going to be able to get...
[788.32 → 790.32] Get up!
[790.96 → 791.28] No!
[792.80 → 793.28] Go away!
[793.28 → 794.64] You might be able...
[794.64 → 795.20] Oh, you died.
[795.20 → 795.76] I think I died.
[795.76 → 796.24] Oh!
[798.00 → 798.40] Crap.
[799.92 → 800.80] Oh, that sucks.
[802.80 → 804.24] If you have a fireball, can you kill them?
[804.24 → 805.36] They come back though, right?
[805.36 → 807.04] I don't think you can...
[807.04 → 807.20] I have no idea.
[807.20 → 809.52] I think there's some way to take them out, but I think they come back.
[809.52 → 810.64] I can't remember.
[810.64 → 811.84] You get a little window or something.
[811.84 → 813.52] Oh yeah, you can take them out with like a star.
[814.24 → 815.20] Like you can definitely...
[815.20 → 817.12] Okay, yeah, but then they come back anyway, right?
[817.12 → 817.28] Yeah.
[817.28 → 817.84] Yeah, okay.
[817.84 → 819.20] So even if you can get rid of them...
[819.20 → 821.28] Someone says Nintendo used EA.
[821.28 → 822.16] It wasn't affected.
[824.16 → 825.20] Yeah, sounds about right.
[825.20 → 826.88] They're only level one EA.
[827.92 → 829.44] So, you're not doing so great.
[831.52 → 832.00] I don't know.
[832.00 → 835.92] Being higher levels of EA do not necessarily mean that you're doing greater.
[837.60 → 838.40] Just saying.
[838.40 → 839.84] Great doesn't determine good or evil.
[840.64 → 841.44] That is true.
[842.16 → 842.72] That is true.
[842.72 → 844.00] You could be...
[844.00 → 847.68] You could be great in a way that's like not useful in a way.
[847.68 → 847.84] Yeah.
[851.44 → 854.00] Like being great at unboxing things.
[859.52 → 860.16] All right.
[860.16 → 863.04] I finally made it through the friggin' saws.
[863.04 → 864.08] More saws!
[864.88 → 865.92] This is ridiculous.
[866.96 → 867.68] I object.
[868.32 → 870.80] And how are there no power-ups in this whole stupid thing?
[870.80 → 872.24] Yeah, I actually noticed that.
[875.44 → 875.92] Very nice.
[876.40 → 876.80] There you go.
[876.80 → 877.92] There's one.
[877.92 → 878.24] All right.
[878.24 → 879.36] My skills are coming back.
[879.36 → 880.56] Because basically that's...
[880.56 → 881.20] That's uh...
[881.92 → 884.72] That segment before was just like how well can you memorize it.
[884.72 → 885.28] It wasn't...
[885.28 → 885.44] Yeah.
[885.44 → 886.00] Yeah.
[886.00 → 887.52] It wasn't a skill-based segment.
[888.00 → 890.00] And I have not memorized it well.
[890.00 → 891.60] I would agree with you on that one.
[891.60 → 892.80] You have to remember like...
[892.80 → 894.56] Okay, I can't go forward on this one.
[894.56 → 896.56] I have to go forward on that one.
[896.56 → 896.80] I have to go forward on that one.
[896.80 → 897.60] Yeah, like...
[897.60 → 898.08] Oh.
[898.08 → 899.60] Oh, I thought that was going to ring around.
[899.60 → 899.68] That's okay.
[899.68 → 900.64] I got this.
[900.64 → 901.28] I got this.
[901.28 → 901.92] I got this.
[901.92 → 902.32] Don't worry.
[902.32 → 904.32] Did the saws ever ring around those platforms?
[904.32 → 905.36] Uh...
[905.36 → 906.08] That's different.
[906.08 → 907.28] There are fireballs that do that.
[907.28 → 907.92] Okay.
[907.92 → 908.64] Oops.
[908.64 → 909.04] Oops.
[909.04 → 909.44] Hang on.
[909.44 → 910.08] Yeah.
[910.08 → 911.60] Yeah, I'm just gonna wait for that.
[911.60 → 912.32] No big deal.
[914.80 → 916.64] Would you consider buying a Project Shield?
[918.96 → 920.08] It's interesting.
[920.08 → 924.64] See, for crazy like brand new attempted to...
[924.64 → 925.36] Oh no!
[925.36 → 926.80] Oh crap!
[926.80 → 927.92] I didn't get enough of a run.
[928.80 → 933.36] For new big like new style, I don't know how else to say this,
[933.36 → 934.40] technology's coming out.
[934.40 → 935.68] I'm more excited for Oculus.
[935.68 → 938.08] Okay.
[938.08 → 943.60] So if I'm going to drop like 300-ish bucks on something, I'm more excited than buying Oculus.
[943.60 → 948.80] So maybe not, but not because I'm not interested in it, just because there's something else
[948.80 → 950.40] that is peeing my attention more.
[950.40 → 952.16] Now, I don't know which one's coming out first.
[955.04 → 956.80] It's definitely possible that...
[956.80 → 957.36] Uh...
[957.36 → 959.36] Oh, I always forget that they turn around.
[960.88 → 964.56] Okay, someone says Nintendo hasn't touched streaming yet, just YouTube.
[965.28 → 969.92] Okay, but the thing about YouTube is that a lot of streamers upload streams to YouTube.
[969.92 → 970.40] Like us.
[970.40 → 971.52] Like us, for example.
[971.92 → 974.40] And you don't really get any monetization from Twitch.
[974.40 → 979.36] Nintendo is currently completely jeopardizing the speed run community's presence on YouTube.
[981.44 → 984.64] Nintendo takes all of it, and it's like the Magikarp of the Pokémon world.
[984.64 → 985.84] EA equals Magikarp.
[985.84 → 986.96] Magikarp is amazing.
[988.00 → 989.12] Magikarp is a beast.
[989.12 → 990.80] Because once you let him a little high enough,
[990.80 → 992.88] you have to carry him a bit.
[992.88 → 995.04] But once you carry him, he will carry the rest of your team.
[995.04 → 996.16] Magikarp is awesome.
[996.16 → 1000.00] Someone says too many companies are taking advantage of streamers and free advertisement streamers.
[1000.00 → 1002.48] But I mean, is it free?
[1002.48 → 1003.52] Is it advertisement?
[1003.52 → 1004.40] I don't know.
[1004.40 → 1006.24] Because I mean, it's not like the streamers aren't getting paid.
[1006.24 → 1007.36] No.
[1007.36 → 1010.64] I mean, we're making money right now, sort of.
[1011.04 → 1013.92] We're not running any ads other than the one to join the stream.
[1013.92 → 1015.52] So trust me, it's not that much.
[1016.08 → 1019.12] But I mean, streamers are getting paid.
[1019.12 → 1021.20] Guys like Day9 are getting paid.
[1021.20 → 1021.68] Oh yeah.
[1021.68 → 1022.16] Trust me.
[1022.16 → 1022.64] Oh yeah.
[1022.64 → 1026.40] He's pretty, oh my goodness, I always forget they turn around.
[1026.40 → 1026.72] Yeah.
[1027.28 → 1028.88] He's pretty bored about that.
[1028.88 → 1032.24] Some streamers are not very bored about themselves getting paid.
[1032.24 → 1035.12] But Day9 has this very obvious, very scripted break.
[1035.68 → 1036.00] Right.
[1036.00 → 1040.00] Where the subscribers get to listen to a song and the other people get to watch another episode.
[1040.00 → 1044.16] Someone says, I'd like to point out that Valve, Moving, Blizzard, and the devs who made FTL
[1044.16 → 1047.60] not only don't mind users making money off their content, but also encourage those
[1048.16 → 1049.84] to make more videos relating to their content.
[1049.84 → 1052.64] So that's one way of looking at it is, is Nintendo wrong?
[1052.64 → 1053.28] Maybe not.
[1053.92 → 1057.92] But are they as grown up as some of the other companies that are really embracing this whole
[1057.92 → 1058.24] thing?
[1058.24 → 1061.44] To fight for the other team a little bit, you can't force people to take different
[1061.44 → 1062.40] marketing perspectives.
[1062.40 → 1062.96] Yes.
[1062.96 → 1064.88] That has to be that brand's decision.
[1065.44 → 1065.68] Yeah.
[1065.68 → 1070.48] It's not like I can just tell Nintendo like, this other company does it this way, so your
[1070.48 → 1074.80] way is wrong, and you're not allowed to do what you want with your content.
[1074.80 → 1076.00] It's their content.
[1076.00 → 1077.36] It's their IP.
[1077.36 → 1078.40] Yeah.
[1078.40 → 1081.20] They created it, so yeah.
[1081.20 → 1087.28] So while I'm on the side of the streamers, we still can't be like, oh well, like I agree,
[1087.28 → 1092.16] Moving, developers of FTL, Steam, all that kind of stuff, or Valve, all that kind of stuff,
[1092.16 → 1095.44] that's awesome, but we can't be like, you're not like them, so you are wrong.
[1095.44 → 1096.40] Yeah.
[1098.24 → 1101.12] And it's one of those things where it's not like the streaming community won't find
[1101.12 → 1102.72] something else to stream.
[1102.72 → 1106.64] One thing interesting that was brought up was speed runs.
[1106.64 → 1108.40] Mario speed runs have kind of been around.
[1108.40 → 1109.60] Yeah, that's a big thing.
[1109.60 → 1110.16] Whatever.
[1110.16 → 1113.60] Someone in Twitch chat said that, so I'm not taking credit for that.
[1113.60 → 1114.16] Yep.
[1114.16 → 1118.00] My favourite speed runs ever are Elder Scrolls speed runs, of course, obviously.
[1118.00 → 1122.64] But how people can beat like, Borrowing, and I think it was like 15 minutes or something.
[1122.64 → 1123.04] Really?
[1123.04 → 1123.52] Yeah.
[1123.52 → 1124.24] That's not even possible.
[1124.24 → 1126.56] There's just some crazy stuff you can do.
[1128.16 → 1128.96] That's kind of ridiculous.
[1128.96 → 1131.84] I can't remember what it was, but I'm pretty sure it was under half an hour.
[1131.84 → 1133.76] You beat Borrowing.
[1133.76 → 1138.32] Obviously you haven't done all the main quests, and you like skip things.
[1138.32 → 1139.12] Yeah.
[1139.12 → 1143.68] And there's like weird ways of doing stuff that isn't proper, but you did technically completely
[1143.68 → 1144.16] do it.
[1144.16 → 1144.56] Right.
[1144.56 → 1145.28] So, alright.
[1145.28 → 1146.72] Like you hit the end sequence.
[1149.52 → 1150.80] Okay, let's see if I can make this.
[1150.80 → 1152.48] So what's the idea here?
[1152.48 → 1153.68] You're skipping the boss door.
[1155.28 → 1155.92] Yeah, there we go.
[1156.72 → 1158.16] No, no, there's another boss door.
[1158.16 → 1158.72] Okay.
[1166.64 → 1167.84] I'm not a very good flyer.
[1167.84 → 1168.80] Oh my goodness.
[1170.16 → 1172.00] I've never been very good at that.
[1172.00 → 1172.56] Wow.
[1172.56 → 1173.76] Oh, so you get all these one-ups?
[1173.76 → 1174.72] Yeah, you get a bunch of one-ups.
[1174.72 → 1176.40] And is it then the same boss door?
[1176.40 → 1177.60] Uh, yeah, same boss.
[1177.60 → 1179.44] That's, wow, that's a lot of one-ups.
[1180.48 → 1182.00] There are other places that are more efficient.
[1182.00 → 1185.44] I probably shouldn't have even bothered doing this because I knew it was a flying thing.
[1186.32 → 1187.52] Well, you only had to try it.
[1187.52 → 1189.28] You only failed once, and you got all these.
[1189.28 → 1190.08] So it was worth it.
[1190.08 → 1192.08] Yeah, I guess so.
[1192.08 → 1193.52] I hate Tenor!
[1195.28 → 1195.84] I hate him!
[1196.72 → 1197.20] Or her.
[1197.20 → 1201.76] Actually, I guess Tenor would be wearing bows if, uh...
[1201.76 → 1202.56] That's how they do.
[1206.96 → 1207.68] Okay, it's all good.
[1207.68 → 1208.40] Don't worry, I got this.
[1208.40 → 1209.36] Holy crap.
[1209.36 → 1211.84] Can you hit the head or no?
[1211.84 → 1213.36] That was like actually stressful.
[1214.40 → 1214.96] Um...
[1214.96 → 1216.56] There we go.
[1217.68 → 1218.24] Sheesh.
[1219.68 → 1220.72] Good job, nice save.
[1222.40 → 1224.24] That was terrible.
[1224.96 → 1225.60] You didn't get hit.
[1226.48 → 1227.12] So...
[1227.12 → 1227.84] That's true.
[1227.84 → 1229.20] I came out of it with a cape.
[1229.20 → 1230.88] I cannot believe I, uh...
[1233.36 → 1233.68] Yeah.
[1237.52 → 1240.08] Someone asks what I think about the Maximus 5 formula.
[1240.64 → 1241.92] I think it's a motherboard.
[1242.80 → 1243.68] I think it's red.
[1244.40 → 1245.92] I think it has good onboard audio.
[1245.92 → 1246.72] I mean, I...
[1246.72 → 1247.20] I don't know.
[1247.20 → 1249.28] I get a little bit confused when people ask me like,
[1249.92 → 1252.40] what do you think about a particular component?
[1252.40 → 1256.24] Because, honestly, a lot of the time it's, um...
[1256.24 → 1258.00] It's not rocket science.
[1258.00 → 1259.20] Asus makes good boards.
[1259.20 → 1260.00] This isn't a secret.
[1260.00 → 1261.12] I don't have to tell you guys that.
[1261.84 → 1264.48] Maximus 5 formula is a very high-end Asus board.
[1264.96 → 1265.28] Okay?
[1265.28 → 1266.56] So Asus makes good boards.
[1266.56 → 1268.40] This is one of the best boards that they can make.
[1269.36 → 1272.24] Is there much for me to contribute to the conversation at this point?
[1272.24 → 1272.88] I don't really know.
[1273.52 → 1276.72] I mean, would I buy a Maximus 5 formula for my system?
[1276.72 → 1276.96] No.
[1278.40 → 1279.76] But I'm not the target audience.
[1279.76 → 1281.36] I already have a great sound card.
[1281.36 → 1283.20] I don't need a Maximus 5 formula.
[1283.20 → 1285.60] And this is another thing that sort of, um...
[1285.60 → 1286.72] A lot of people commented...
[1286.72 → 1288.08] You can jump on them when they're doing that,
[1288.08 → 1289.44] as long as they're not doing it up.
[1289.44 → 1291.52] This is something that a lot of people commented about
[1291.52 → 1294.32] on the system build that we uploaded the other night.
[1294.32 → 1295.92] Is, oh, well, I wouldn't have bought that.
[1295.92 → 1298.88] Or, oh, well, Linus, you bought one of those,
[1298.88 → 1300.00] but you bought a different one.
[1300.00 → 1302.16] So what you're recommending in the system build
[1302.16 → 1302.96] isn't the right thing.
[1302.96 → 1304.64] But that's not necessarily right.
[1304.64 → 1307.52] Because if I recommended exactly what I would buy,
[1307.52 → 1309.60] then we'd end up with kind of stupid system.
[1309.60 → 1310.32] Because...
[1310.32 → 1313.04] There would be one company for every type of product.
[1313.04 → 1313.68] That would be it.
[1314.72 → 1315.60] I would fly this.
[1316.40 → 1317.04] If you can.
[1317.04 → 1319.20] I don't see how you have that.
[1319.20 → 1321.12] Can you?
[1321.12 → 1322.08] Whoa, whoa.
[1322.08 → 1324.72] If you can get the dolphins to stop harassing you
[1324.72 → 1325.68] for long enough time to stay.
[1325.68 → 1326.64] Can I make a full run?
[1326.64 → 1327.68] Sometimes.
[1329.20 → 1329.76] So, yeah.
[1329.76 → 1333.04] I mean, I would blow a bunch of money on a stupid case or something.
[1333.92 → 1337.68] And I would spend a bunch of money on a sound card
[1337.68 → 1339.76] instead of buying a motherboard with good onboard sound.
[1339.76 → 1342.80] Because even the best onboard sound wouldn't be something that I'd be happy with.
[1344.24 → 1345.60] And, yeah.
[1345.60 → 1348.56] I'd just buy a bunch of stuff that not necessarily everyone would want.
[1348.56 → 1352.40] And so I went with what I thought were safe recommendations for most people.
[1352.40 → 1356.72] There were a lot of people questioning the use of the 660 Ti instead of the 7950 as well.
[1356.72 → 1363.36] Because we've shown time and time again on our videos that the 7950 outperforms the 660 Ti when
[1363.36 → 1366.72] they're both overclocked in many scenarios.
[1366.72 → 1369.84] GeForce Experience is going to retroactively go on to...
[1369.84 → 1370.72] Not retroactively.
[1373.68 → 1374.16] Never mind.
[1374.16 → 1374.88] I'm going to stop that.
[1374.88 → 1375.44] Okay.
[1375.44 → 1382.48] But there are benefits other than just to your performance for Nvidia cards.
[1382.48 → 1386.00] So GeForce Experience is in beta right now and keeps your drivers updated.
[1386.64 → 1387.44] The fact that...
[1387.44 → 1387.92] And, okay.
[1387.92 → 1388.48] Remember, guys.
[1388.48 → 1394.48] Part of the point of this system was good performance now, easy degradability later.
[1394.48 → 1398.72] Crossfire is not a good user experience right now.
[1400.48 → 1403.04] Because there's so much stuttering...
[1405.44 → 1411.60] There's so much micro-stuttering with dual AMD graphics card solutions that it's not really
[1411.60 → 1412.96] something that I can recommend.
[1412.96 → 1419.12] And I've had people going, well, oh, Linus, they have a new driver coming that improves it.
[1419.12 → 1419.76] I'm like, okay.
[1420.72 → 1424.08] And then when we make another build guide, then we'll talk.
[1424.08 → 1427.60] But for now, I have to recommend what you're actually buying right now.
[1427.60 → 1435.12] Because AMD's prototype driver is actually based on an ancient, ancient driver that doesn't have
[1435.12 → 1438.80] any optimizations for the latest games and all kinds of stuff like that.
[1440.24 → 1440.48] So...
[1441.76 → 1442.40] Oh, right.
[1442.40 → 1443.12] I don't remember this.
[1444.08 → 1445.36] Oh, where do I need them to go?
[1446.08 → 1447.20] I have to take them somewhere.
[1447.20 → 1447.76] What?
[1447.76 → 1448.56] I don't like that.
[1448.56 → 1449.92] Yeah, I got to bring them over here or something.
[1451.12 → 1451.76] That's crazy.
[1451.76 → 1452.32] Yeah.
[1460.88 → 1464.40] And I mean, Never Settle is a very strong argument for buying AMD cards.
[1465.04 → 1466.24] 100% agree.
[1466.24 → 1468.08] Never Settle is amazing.
[1468.08 → 1476.24] The fact that AMD is giving you the stuff that you actually need and want for your gaming experience
[1476.24 → 1478.56] is fantastic.
[1482.88 → 1483.20] Thanks.
[1483.92 → 1485.36] So, you know what?
[1485.36 → 1485.68] Yeah.
[1485.68 → 1488.16] I mean, Nvidia is doing Metro Last Light, which is great.
[1488.16 → 1491.28] But AMD is giving away like three to four games with a lot of their cards.
[1491.28 → 1491.84] That's really cool.
[1491.84 → 1498.32] But bear in mind, when I do these build guides, I do them as a long-term content thing.
[1498.32 → 1501.36] I don't want to be like, okay, I went with this because you got some free game.
[1502.00 → 1502.32] Okay?
[1502.32 → 1505.84] Because free game chat might not be...
[1506.48 → 1511.84] That exact set of free games might not actually be that great of a set when someone way down the
[1511.84 → 1514.64] road ends up watching the video, and you can buy all those games on Steam for five bucks.
[1514.64 → 1517.84] Or even, I mean, I have no guarantee how Never long Settle is going to be there.
[1517.84 → 1518.96] So maybe Never Settle...
[1518.96 → 1520.16] Don't use any of those.
[1520.16 → 1523.76] So maybe Never Settle, you know, goes away in two weeks.
[1523.76 → 1524.88] So meanwhile, my video...
[1524.88 → 1525.84] Which I was planning.
[1525.84 → 1528.64] I was planning the components for it like three, four weeks ago.
[1528.64 → 1531.20] So maybe by then, by...
[1534.08 → 1537.76] Like maybe by the time I actually end up making the video, it's like gone or something.
[1537.76 → 1539.04] I have no way of knowing that.
[1539.04 → 1542.16] So I try not to plan stuff like that around free games.
[1542.16 → 1548.88] And I've had people saying 7950 is the best price per dollar card out there.
[1548.88 → 1549.60] You should have gone with that.
[1549.60 → 1550.72] No, it isn't.
[1550.72 → 1554.72] The 7850 is probably the best performance per dollar card.
[1554.72 → 1556.16] Or maybe the 7770.
[1556.16 → 1556.64] Oh!
[1556.64 → 1558.08] They're both excellent.
[1558.08 → 1562.56] And you tend not to find the best performance per dollar cards at those higher price points.
[1563.12 → 1569.04] You might have the best performance per dollar for a high price point, high performance card.
[1569.04 → 1573.04] But it won't be like just the highest performance one period necessarily.
[1573.04 → 1573.52] Oh!
[1573.52 → 1574.56] Oh, you got the mushroom.
[1576.08 → 1576.48] Okay.
[1577.04 → 1577.52] Very nice.
[1579.44 → 1581.60] Someone asked if I like jalapeños on my pizza.
[1583.60 → 1584.48] Jalapeños are right.
[1584.48 → 1586.40] Yeah, I like jalapeños.
[1587.92 → 1589.04] I forget how this level works.
[1589.04 → 1590.24] Why are there so many mushrooms?
[1590.24 → 1592.00] This level is kind of tricky.
[1592.00 → 1596.08] Like it's something to do with like the coins or if you don't hit any enemies or something,
[1596.08 → 1598.16] there are two different exits for it.
[1598.16 → 1600.88] I can't remember how it works for the life of me.
[1600.88 → 1604.24] But someone says cyanide and happiness.
[1604.24 → 1606.56] Cyanide and happiness can be funny sometimes.
[1606.56 → 1610.32] It can also be like horribly, horribly disturbing other than what's happening.
[1611.12 → 1611.44] It's okay.
[1611.44 → 1612.16] Just make the jump.
[1612.16 → 1618.32] What the devil is that?
[1621.12 → 1621.60] Just go.
[1630.08 → 1632.08] Someone asks if I finally sold my bike.
[1632.08 → 1634.16] No, but I have someone coming to look at it tomorrow.
[1635.76 → 1636.40] I made it.
[1636.40 → 1644.24] I'm going to see if I can find the stupid exit.
[1644.24 → 1646.16] Yeah, it just goes in a loop.
[1646.16 → 1647.60] Like it's not useful at all.
[1647.60 → 1651.20] But I think you have to not hit any bad guys or something.
[1652.96 → 1654.48] Or like not collect any...
[1654.48 → 1656.64] Oh, maybe you have to not get that thing.
[1656.64 → 1658.48] Like I don't remember some weird thing.
[1658.48 → 1659.52] So I'm going to see if I get it.
[1662.72 → 1663.84] This part was just nuts.
[1663.84 → 1666.24] I was so sad when I lost her.
[1666.24 → 1667.44] Do I have a cape?
[1667.44 → 1667.68] Yeah.
[1668.80 → 1671.04] Oh, I should have done this.
[1672.56 → 1672.88] No.
[1672.88 → 1678.16] Oh yeah, and there's a neat way to do that level with the horrible secret exit.
[1678.16 → 1679.92] Apparently if you fly right at the beginning...
[1679.92 → 1681.92] Yeah, this is the other exit.
[1682.40 → 1684.24] Apparently if you fly right at the beginning...
[1687.92 → 1690.48] And then you just fly the whole time.
[1690.48 → 1695.92] The timing is perfect so you only land on things that Joshi bounces on.
[1696.48 → 1697.20] The whole level.
[1697.20 → 1699.28] It's insane how they did stuff like that.
[1699.28 → 1700.24] Yeah, I know, right?
[1700.24 → 1702.08] Oh, that brings you to a pipe.
[1702.56 → 1703.12] No, no.
[1703.12 → 1703.60] Oh wait.
[1703.60 → 1704.64] Oh, it does go to a pipe.
[1704.64 → 1705.28] Oh, that's right.
[1705.28 → 1706.08] It does do something.
[1706.64 → 1707.28] I can't remember.
[1707.28 → 1709.04] I thought it was one that was just a loop.
[1709.04 → 1710.88] But maybe I'm thinking of Forest of Illusion.
[1710.88 → 1712.24] Do you mind if I go around a pipe?
[1712.24 → 1713.04] I've never done stuff like that.
[1713.04 → 1713.20] Hmm?
[1714.80 → 1715.20] Fine.
[1715.92 → 1716.72] Oh, I thought you said that.
[1716.72 → 1717.44] Steal my thunder.
[1717.44 → 1717.84] I don't care.
[1717.84 → 1718.40] No, that's fine.
[1718.40 → 1718.80] No, no, no.
[1718.80 → 1719.68] I don't care.
[1719.68 → 1720.24] I don't care.
[1720.24 → 1721.68] You have to wait for the animation now.
[1721.68 → 1722.40] Yeah, I know, right?
[1722.40 → 1723.36] Whatever.
[1723.36 → 1724.24] I'll see you.
[1726.40 → 1727.84] I'll see you on the other side.
[1727.84 → 1728.32] Yeah, man.
[1733.12 → 1733.76] Ahhhh.
[1733.76 → 1735.12] The nothing?
[1735.12 → 1735.60] Yeah, the...
[1737.20 → 1738.08] Ah, the graph.
[1739.20 → 1739.84] Where's the graph?
[1739.84 → 1740.80] Oh, it's on Google Drive.
[1741.92 → 1742.16] Yeah.
[1743.60 → 1744.16] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1744.16 → 1745.20] I think you're shared on it.
[1745.20 → 1746.80] I think you're shared on it.
[1746.80 → 1747.20] Okay.
[1748.64 → 1750.24] Is there anything special with these people?
[1751.12 → 1752.64] Or are they just chilling out there for fun?
[1754.32 → 1755.36] Ah, well they're blue.
[1755.36 → 1758.16] So if you had a Joshi, you could eat them and you could get wings.
[1758.16 → 1760.24] You can get down to that from the other side, I think.
[1760.24 → 1761.12] Or you could do it this way.
[1761.12 → 1762.08] That's also fun.
[1762.80 → 1763.52] Look at what this is.
[1764.32 → 1765.52] Feather, yay!
[1765.52 → 1766.88] That might well make this level easier.
[1769.04 → 1771.76] So, um, you need shoes, hey?
[1772.88 → 1773.20] Yeah.
[1773.20 → 1774.72] How's that going?
[1775.76 → 1777.04] What do you mean?
[1777.04 → 1778.64] I thought you were going shopping.
[1778.64 → 1780.16] For running shoes?
[1780.16 → 1780.56] Yeah.
[1780.56 → 1781.36] I already have those.
[1781.36 → 1783.36] Oh, okay.
[1783.36 → 1786.24] Uh, but you're getting new clothes before our Computer trip, right?
[1786.24 → 1786.64] Yes.
[1786.64 → 1786.96] Okay.
[1786.96 → 1788.16] Definitely.
[1788.16 → 1789.84] Are you getting, like, dress shoes?
[1789.84 → 1790.32] Yes.
[1790.32 → 1790.88] Okay.
[1790.88 → 1792.88] So I have...
[1792.88 → 1796.64] I will attempt to not look as hobo as I did at CES.
[1796.64 → 1799.84] Honestly, you were worse dressed than some of the homeless people were.
[1799.84 → 1801.84] That was actually what spurred it all.
[1801.84 → 1803.12] At first I didn't care.
[1803.12 → 1806.16] And then I was like, okay, I'm actually worse dressed than homeless.
[1806.16 → 1810.40] Like, when I call you a hobo, like, I think it didn't sink in because you thought I was just
[1810.40 → 1811.12] trolling you?
[1811.12 → 1813.44] Well, no, I knew I wasn't exactly well-dressed.
[1813.44 → 1814.96] That's never been my...
[1814.96 → 1816.64] Nice.
[1816.64 → 1818.80] That's never been my thing.
[1818.80 → 1824.16] But when I went to Las Vegas and was not as well-dressed as homeless people, I was like,
[1824.16 → 1829.04] oh, I could live in Las Vegas and be a homeless person and be apparently entirely fine.
[1829.04 → 1831.92] So that was a little bit of a, uh...
[1831.92 → 1833.20] Spin, spin.
[1833.20 → 1834.40] Just drop next to it and spin.
[1836.00 → 1837.44] And then recover and glide.
[1837.44 → 1839.52] Okay, we'll do that.
[1839.52 → 1840.56] Oh, and it was just a feather.
[1840.56 → 1841.36] You already have two in there.
[1843.76 → 1844.16] Okay.
[1845.20 → 1845.52] Oh!
[1845.52 → 1848.40] Well, okay, now you have to get at least one of them.
[1849.68 → 1851.04] Okay, good recovery, sort of.
[1855.04 → 1855.36] Okay.
[1856.96 → 1859.28] You are just having some luck here.
[1859.28 → 1866.00] Um, so anyway, you know, I had probably one of the funniest shopping experiences I think I've ever had.
[1866.00 → 1866.72] Let me just wait for it.
[1868.56 → 1873.92] So I was buying badminton shoes and, I mean, sporting apparel is one of the worst offenders
[1873.92 → 1879.84] for just, like, stupid, needless cosmetic upgrades being the thing that prompts, like,
[1879.84 → 1881.12] spending way more money on them.
[1882.24 → 1882.64] Um...
[1885.20 → 1886.80] So anyway, there are two pairs of these shoes.
[1886.80 → 1888.24] Oh, okay, that wasn't the situation.
[1888.88 → 1890.72] There are two pairs of these shoes.
[1890.72 → 1892.32] One of them's blue and one of them's red.
[1892.32 → 1896.08] And the red one's, like, a special edition, like, Team China one or something like that.
[1896.08 → 1897.84] And I'm like, oh, these look really similar.
[1897.84 → 1899.44] So I asked the guy in the shop, I'm like...
[1900.32 → 1903.04] Because, honestly, like, shoe snail... shoe sales?
[1903.04 → 1906.80] Is that the biggest, like, schwa ck of snake oil that ever existed or what?
[1908.00 → 1908.56] Did you see that?
[1908.56 → 1908.72] Yeah.
[1909.60 → 1911.04] That's the one I was thinking of before.
[1911.76 → 1913.44] Where it just trolls you and goes in a circle.
[1913.44 → 1914.40] That's ridiculous.
[1914.40 → 1915.68] Yeah, shoe sales are ignored.
[1915.68 → 1920.00] I mean, some of them, some shoes are legitimately... they weigh, like, nothing.
[1920.00 → 1920.64] So get this.
[1921.36 → 1922.32] I'm like, what's the difference?
[1922.32 → 1925.12] And the guy's like, oh, this one has more technology.
[1925.12 → 1927.92] I'm like, what technology does it have?
[1927.92 → 1930.96] And he's like, oh, it has, uh... it's pretty similar, but it has more technology.
[1930.96 → 1931.52] I'm like, okay.
[1931.52 → 1931.92] That's a lot of shoes.
[1931.92 → 1933.28] You put two of them together in the bag.
[1933.28 → 1934.08] Oh, that's a shoe.
[1934.08 → 1934.64] No, yo, yo!
[1936.16 → 1936.64] That's okay.
[1936.64 → 1937.60] These guys are easier to pick.
[1937.60 → 1941.76] What?
[1941.76 → 1943.44] You're not shared on Google Drive?
[1944.40 → 1944.88] I got it.
[1944.88 → 1945.52] Oh, okay.
[1946.80 → 1949.60] But yeah, I mean, have you guys ever experienced something like that?
[1949.60 → 1951.60] We'd love to hear from Twitch chat.
[1951.60 → 1953.60] I don't buy expensive shoes, so...
[1953.60 → 1954.00] I guess.
[1954.72 → 1958.08] And, like, it was one of those things where it was the difference between, like, $110 and
[1958.08 → 1965.20] $120, but I was just like, why am I going to buy, like, Team China shoes, where they claim it's more
[1965.20 → 1967.60] technology, but it actually makes no difference whatsoever.
[1967.60 → 1968.00] You know what?
[1968.00 → 1971.04] I always try to do this, and I always screw it up, and I can't figure out why.
[1971.04 → 1972.80] Does it slide the whole way?
[1972.80 → 1973.20] Yeah.
[1974.08 → 1975.52] Does it make you jump at the end or something?
[1975.52 → 1976.00] Careful.
[1976.00 → 1977.60] No, it doesn't really do anything, I think.
[1979.52 → 1979.92] You know what?
[1979.92 → 1981.20] Let's just do this.
[1981.20 → 1982.48] This is much more controlled.
[1983.44 → 1985.20] Someone says, steel toes are different.
[1985.20 → 1986.56] Yeah, agreed.
[1986.56 → 1987.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1987.28 → 1991.84] If we're talking, like, safety footwear, we're having a very different conversation.
[1991.84 → 1993.20] You said sports equipment, right?
[1993.20 → 1993.60] Yeah.
[1993.60 → 1994.00] Yeah.
[1994.00 → 1998.32] Talking sporting goods, where a lot of the time it seems to be just snake oil.
[1999.12 → 2001.20] Then again, how much of what we buy isn't snake oil?
[2004.00 → 2005.36] You could probably get one-ups in here.
[2008.96 → 2009.28] Neat.
[2009.92 → 2014.72] I don't know.
[2014.72 → 2015.20] What?
[2015.20 → 2020.00] When I go buy shoes, like, I'm size 13 feet, so when I go buy shoes, it's like, this one
[2020.00 → 2021.20] fits me, and I don't hate it.
[2021.20 → 2021.84] Okay.
[2023.68 → 2025.44] I have found a pair of shoes I will buy.
[2025.44 → 2026.48] Yeah.
[2026.48 → 2028.64] You don't have enough of a choice.
[2028.64 → 2029.44] Oh!
[2029.44 → 2031.36] Speaking of shoes that might not fit you.
[2032.32 → 2036.16] Guys, we're going to be going to Seattle to try out the...
[2036.16 → 2037.28] Oh crap, what's it called?
[2037.28 → 2037.92] The Omni...
[2037.92 → 2038.32] Omni.
[2038.32 → 2038.72] I think it's just...
[2038.72 → 2040.00] What's the company called?
[2040.00 → 2040.64] I think it's just...
[2040.64 → 2041.04] I think it's just...
[2041.04 → 2042.72] I will look it up right now.
[2049.68 → 2050.08] Oh!
[2050.08 → 2050.56] Oh!
[2050.56 → 2051.12] Good job.
[2051.12 → 2052.80] Virtual Omni.
[2052.80 → 2053.92] Yeah, Virtual Omni.
[2053.92 → 2054.80] Yeah!
[2054.80 → 2057.76] So we're going to be trying it out on the 25th.
[2057.76 → 2062.96] Both Slick and B-Roll will be coming down with me to Seattle, where they're doing a special
[2062.96 → 2064.80] demo for us, which is going to be really cool.
[2064.80 → 2070.48] I told Chris Peril lo, Locker Gnome, that we're going to be in town that day, but we haven't
[2070.48 → 2071.52] actually made any plans.
[2071.52 → 2077.60] He asked me to come to Vlogger Fair, and my intention was to see if I could try to make it.
[2077.60 → 2081.60] But the problem is that I'm going to be on a flight back from Computer now that we're going there,
[2082.40 → 2084.56] at the time that Vlogger Fair is running.
[2084.56 → 2089.60] So there's going to be tons of cool video personalities that are going to be there.
[2089.60 → 2090.72] It's going to be really cool.
[2090.72 → 2095.28] Guys, if you're in Seattle, or if you're nearby, check out Vlogger Fair.
[2095.28 → 2098.48] I think it's running on the 11th or something like that.
[2100.96 → 2103.04] So someone says Chris Peril lo is annoying.
[2103.04 → 2103.76] Well, come on.
[2107.04 → 2112.40] He's been around a long time, and he's actually pioneered a lot of the things that us tech
[2112.40 → 2113.36] YouTubers do.
[2114.24 → 2117.84] So yeah, don't knock people too hard.
[2117.84 → 2123.04] Someone asked if the Corsair Vengeance 2000 survived the water when we filmed the banned
[2123.04 → 2123.84] version of the commercial.
[2123.84 → 2124.40] Yes, it did.
[2125.04 → 2127.52] We didn't have it powered on at the time, so that probably helps.
[2127.52 → 2128.48] It didn't really affect that much.
[2128.48 → 2130.48] I think right there, I can move.
[2130.48 → 2131.92] Okay, now I'm just going to walk.
[2131.92 → 2132.88] Oh, okay.
[2132.88 → 2134.40] You got to find a secret exit.
[2134.40 → 2134.88] Yeah.
[2136.80 → 2137.76] Or do I have to not...
[2137.76 → 2138.32] Okay.
[2140.96 → 2141.76] What are we...
[2141.76 → 2142.16] There we go.
[2142.16 → 2144.32] Oh, you can probably fly it.
[2145.68 → 2146.24] Can you fly?
[2146.24 → 2147.36] I'm just going to go for the...
[2148.56 → 2150.64] I don't really remember how, but I'm assuming he's Chris.
[2150.64 → 2151.84] Okay, back.
[2151.84 → 2152.40] There you go.
[2152.40 → 2152.80] Back.
[2152.80 → 2153.20] Rhythm.
[2153.20 → 2154.00] Rhythm.
[2154.00 → 2154.32] Nope.
[2157.52 → 2159.52] Okay, why don't you just do it your way?
[2161.52 → 2165.28] And it's risky because if you go too far trying to fly the whole level,
[2165.92 → 2168.00] then what will happen is...
[2169.68 → 2171.20] I don't remember doing this, but I think I might have.
[2171.84 → 2172.16] Nope.
[2172.72 → 2175.44] If you go too far trying to fly the whole level, you'll miss the secret exit.
[2176.56 → 2179.12] Someone asks, is anything good going on in Vegas in September?
[2179.12 → 2180.56] I have no idea.
[2183.04 → 2184.40] No one's talking in Twitch chat.
[2184.40 → 2185.52] Is anyone even watching?
[2185.52 → 2186.08] Oh, yeah.
[2186.08 → 2187.84] Apparently 1,800 people are watching.
[2187.84 → 2188.64] Wow, thank you guys.
[2188.64 → 2191.44] Everyone's super-duper focused on my spin around the circle.
[2191.44 → 2192.32] No, I don't think they are.
[2192.32 → 2193.12] Can you just go?
[2195.28 → 2196.48] Go!
[2196.48 → 2197.28] Where do I go?
[2198.40 → 2198.88] There we go.
[2201.84 → 2205.20] We totally have to play some older Mario games.
[2206.64 → 2208.40] Because those I'm not good at.
[2209.44 → 2212.24] Like the older ones with the ducks that spit the eggs and stuff.
[2213.12 → 2213.28] Yeah.
[2213.92 → 2214.56] Like I'm not good.
[2214.56 → 2215.36] Okay, watch.
[2215.36 → 2216.08] Wait, wait.
[2216.08 → 2217.60] Okay, see these exit arrows?
[2217.60 → 2218.32] Yeah.
[2218.32 → 2219.12] You want to go this.
[2219.12 → 2220.32] You have to fly.
[2220.32 → 2221.20] I have to fly.
[2221.20 → 2221.44] Yeah.
[2221.44 → 2223.60] Well, kill him first.
[2223.60 → 2225.68] If you had a Joshi here that would actually be kind of awesome.
[2225.68 → 2226.96] I would pick that and get him again.
[2227.68 → 2228.00] There you go.
[2228.88 → 2229.12] Okay.
[2229.68 → 2230.48] So you want to fly.
[2233.04 → 2233.68] Oh, too high.
[2233.68 → 2234.56] Oh wait, no, it's okay.
[2234.56 → 2235.04] Yeah, it's okay.
[2235.04 → 2236.00] No, no, no!
[2236.00 → 2236.48] No!
[2237.28 → 2238.16] What are you doing?
[2238.16 → 2240.00] Well, you said no, so I turned around.
[2240.00 → 2242.32] I thought it was just stupid.
[2242.32 → 2242.72] Oh.
[2244.16 → 2244.72] Dang.
[2245.36 → 2246.24] Oh, man.
[2247.44 → 2249.20] And someone's saying you can play Super Mario.
[2249.20 → 2250.88] Everyone's like OMG.
[2251.68 → 2254.64] People are like you can play Super Mario All-Stars and yes, we can.
[2255.20 → 2260.88] Noob lol LMAO lol total play trolled lol slick you're fired.
[2260.88 → 2263.04] Yeah.
[2263.04 → 2263.60] Yeah.
[2263.60 → 2265.36] Oh, a link to- oh, good work.
[2265.36 → 2265.76] Almost.
[2266.32 → 2267.84] It still doesn't top my first one.
[2267.84 → 2268.56] Oh, I don't care.
[2268.56 → 2269.44] You have to match the middle.
[2269.44 → 2272.72] And you told- I don't even-you told me to turn around, so I turned around.
[2273.52 → 2274.56] I didn't say turn around.
[2274.56 → 2275.28] I said wait, no!
[2275.28 → 2275.84] You said no!
[2275.84 → 2276.88] Or something.
[2276.88 → 2279.52] And when you're going in a direction and someone says no, you turn around.
[2280.32 → 2281.28] Or you stop.
[2281.28 → 2282.64] How are you supposed to stop?
[2282.64 → 2284.64] Let's see who can beat the castle first, you or me.
[2284.64 → 2286.00] Are you on the castle right now?
[2286.00 → 2287.20] Yeah, but I'm bad at this one.
[2291.36 → 2291.92] Aw, crap.
[2293.36 → 2294.24] I hate these guys.
[2295.04 → 2296.08] Just annoying.
[2296.08 → 2300.40] Like I already hated them in- like normally and then now they can throw stuff.
[2300.40 → 2301.12] Yeah, I know, right?
[2302.16 → 2303.76] It's like actually not cool.
[2303.76 → 2305.60] Oh, I thought he's going to throw stuff.
[2305.60 → 2307.68] Yay, he's gone.
[2307.68 → 2309.28] Aw, I hate this castle.
[2309.28 → 2312.80] I'm so crappy at the segment where um-
[2312.80 → 2314.80] Oh no.
[2314.80 → 2316.00] Oh no.
[2316.00 → 2316.80] Oh no!
[2318.80 → 2319.52] What's that one?
[2319.52 → 2320.88] Oh.
[2320.88 → 2322.16] That was explained quickly.
[2323.76 → 2326.80] Oh, I'm not happy about that at all.
[2326.80 → 2327.76] He's okay.
[2327.76 → 2329.04] He's too fine.
[2329.04 → 2332.00] Yeah, he's not as close.
[2336.64 → 2338.16] Oh, I will die for sure.
[2338.16 → 2340.24] I've actually only beaten this castle a couple of times.
[2342.80 → 2344.80] Ooh!
[2351.44 → 2355.60] Like there are ways to make life easier for yourself by running ahead or not running ahead,
[2355.60 → 2360.80] but I haven't memorized it so it's pretty challenging.
[2360.80 → 2361.52] Yeah.
[2361.52 → 2362.88] I think I'm about to get smoked.
[2364.00 → 2364.08] Oh!
[2364.08 → 2367.36] Yeah, if I waited a little bit longer I could have landed it almost.
[2367.36 → 2368.16] I'll just go up there.
[2368.16 → 2368.40] Yeah.
[2374.56 → 2379.20] Is Google Fibre the push that ISPs need to start providing higher speeds and more reasonable prices?
[2379.20 → 2379.52] I mean-
[2379.52 → 2380.16] Okay.
[2380.16 → 2384.96] I don't think it'll make a difference until it's rolled out in enough areas that it actually impacts
[2384.96 → 2389.36] their bottom line because at the end of the day money, money, money, money, money, money.
[2389.36 → 2397.36] So if it's just like, you know, oh, public outrage that the providers are not upgrading their pipes, it's like-
[2397.36 → 2398.00] That's cool, bro.
[2398.00 → 2406.64] Yeah, that's been going on for a long time. People have been mad for a long time. It doesn't seem to matter because you still need it. You still give them money.
[2406.64 → 2407.76] It comes down to-
[2407.76 → 2410.88] See, this is something we were talking about earlier today. I don't remember the context.
[2410.88 → 2411.84] Micro transactions.
[2411.84 → 2419.04] Micro transactions. As long as you're giving them money, they will never, ever, ever listen to you.
[2420.32 → 2427.20] They just won't. Like, I'm unhappy with the fact that Shaw Cable, my local television provider, does not support cable card.
[2427.68 → 2436.40] So cable card would allow me to record TV shows digitally on my computer using a cable card. It's rolled out in the States. There are lots of places where it works.
[2436.40 → 2441.84] Every time they call me and offer me TV service because I have my internet through them, I tell them, not until cable card.
[2442.40 → 2450.40] I'm not going to give them a dollar for TV until they provide the TV that I want. That's the only way to make them understand.
[2450.40 → 2464.40] If everybody cancelled their TV subscriptions with Shaw tomorrow and said, we're not going to pay you until you have cable card, they would find a way to have cable card. Guaranteed. 100%.
[2466.40 → 2469.40] So that's that. Oh, you missed this stuff.
[2469.40 → 2476.40] I didn't know where it was. I just didn't want to go too low and then have it be further away.
[2476.40 → 2478.40] I've never done that before.
[2478.40 → 2484.40] Apparently, Blogger Fair is June 8th tonight from one of the Twitch chat members.
[2484.40 → 2491.40] Someone asked if you'll think Ultrabooks will become cheaper. Not really. What is there to become cheaper about them? You can get like $600, $700 Ultrabooks.
[2491.40 → 2494.40] SSDs will probably become cheaper though, which will maybe inherently be cheaper.
[2494.40 → 2501.40] I don't think they will. Because look at what a hard drive costs. A hard drive isn't cheaper anymore. It's just bigger.
[2501.40 → 2503.40] That much, yeah.
[2503.40 → 2514.40] So, no, I think SSDs are just going to be bigger. I don't think they're going to get cheaper because there's a certain point at which there's a certain like bill of materials that goes into making the things.
[2514.40 → 2523.40] Like you have to make a casing for it, and you have to have a controller, and you have to like manufacture an NAND flash. Like there's a limit.
[2523.40 → 2530.40] You know, hard drives basically run on magic because they have magnets in them so...
[2530.40 → 2533.40] I mean you have to manufacture an NAND. You have to refill your NAND.
[2533.40 → 2534.40] Like...
[2534.40 → 2535.40] You need blue.
[2535.40 → 2538.40] How are they going to pay Harry Potter the salary he deserves?
[2538.40 → 2540.40] There we go.
[2540.40 → 2542.40] Very nice job.
[2542.40 → 2546.40] I think the blue ones don't give you anything.
[2546.40 → 2547.40] I can't reach it.
[2547.40 → 2549.40] Is it just like a jumping spot?
[2549.40 → 2550.40] Perhaps.
[2550.40 → 2551.40] It's kind of nuts.
[2551.40 → 2552.40] Oh, you need it.
[2552.40 → 2553.40] Yeah, it is.
[2553.40 → 2554.40] Wow.
[2554.40 → 2555.40] No, you don't need it.
[2555.40 → 2556.40] I think you can do it without it.
[2556.40 → 2557.40] But it's like...
[2557.40 → 2558.40] Well, you can probably jump from the stone one to the stone one.
[2558.40 → 2559.40] It's probably a lot harder.
[2559.40 → 2560.40] Yeah.
[2560.40 → 2561.40] Yeah.
[2561.40 → 2564.40] Yeah, here I can just kind of chill.
[2564.40 → 2565.40] Yeah.
[2565.40 → 2566.40] And like, no idea.
[2566.40 → 2567.40] Hmm.
[2567.40 → 2569.40] Trying to figure out when the heck you actually want to chill.
[2569.40 → 2570.40] Yeah.
[2570.40 → 2575.40] Yeah, I've really only beat this castle a couple of times.
[2575.40 → 2578.40] This part, I always get hit.
[2578.40 → 2579.40] Like, no matter what.
[2579.40 → 2581.40] For some reason, I just can't get the timing.
[2581.40 → 2585.40] That's not just pretty nice.
[2585.40 → 2586.40] Oh!
[2586.40 → 2587.40] Oh!
[2587.40 → 2588.40] There you go.
[2588.40 → 2589.40] Nice.
[2589.40 → 2593.40] But then there's like, at least I've got the uh, at least I've got the gate.
[2593.40 → 2594.40] Yeah.
[2594.40 → 2595.40] Okay.
[2595.40 → 2596.40] Is...
[2596.40 → 2603.40] Wait, maybe this isn't the one with the like, crazy bit at the end where you have to outrun all
[2603.40 → 2604.40] the crap.
[2604.40 → 2605.40] I don't know.
[2605.40 → 2606.40] I don't remember.
[2606.40 → 2607.40] Uh.
[2607.40 → 2608.40] I hate this guy because he moves so slow.
[2608.40 → 2609.40] And it's like, hard to avoid.
[2609.40 → 2610.40] Get all away!
[2610.40 → 2611.40] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2611.40 → 2612.40] Lumpy space princess.
[2612.40 → 2613.40] Oh, now you have to wait.
[2613.40 → 2614.40] Oh.
[2614.40 → 2615.40] No, it's okay.
[2615.40 → 2616.40] I got lots of time.
[2616.40 → 2617.40] Yeah, I know.
[2617.40 → 2618.40] I think.
[2618.40 → 2619.40] Yeah, I know.
[2619.40 → 2620.40] Wow, I don't have lots of time.
[2620.40 → 2621.40] No, you don't.
[2621.40 → 2622.40] I thought you did.
[2622.40 → 2623.40] There will be time now that I have the midway point though.
[2623.40 → 2624.40] True.
[2624.40 → 2625.40] There will be time now that I have the midway point though.
[2625.40 → 2626.40] But now there will be a lot of time throughout the base.
[2626.40 → 2627.40] There must be like a way faster way to do this, but I don't know.
[2627.40 → 2628.40] So.
[2628.40 → 2629.40] Oh.
[2629.40 → 2630.40] Shoot!
[2630.40 → 2631.40] I remember that too.
[2631.40 → 2632.40] What?
[2632.40 → 2634.40] Do you have to wait for this to be a different spot or something?
[2634.40 → 2635.40] Yeah, I think it looks good.
[2635.40 → 2636.40] Oh.
[2636.40 → 2637.40] Oh.
[2637.40 → 2638.40] Oh.
[2638.40 → 2639.40] Oh.
[2639.40 → 2640.40] Oh.
[2640.40 → 2641.40] Oh.
[2641.40 → 2642.40] Oh.
[2642.40 → 2643.40] Oh.
[2643.40 → 2644.40] Oh.
[2644.40 → 2645.40] Oh.
[2645.40 → 2646.40] Oh.
[2646.40 → 2647.40] Oh.
[2647.40 → 2648.40] Oh.
[2648.40 → 2649.40] Oh.
[2649.40 → 2650.40] Oh.
[2650.40 → 2651.40] Oh.
[2651.40 → 2652.40] Oh.
[2652.40 → 2653.40] Oh.
[2653.40 → 2654.40] Oh.
[2654.40 → 2655.40] Oh.
[2655.40 → 2656.40] Oh.
[2656.40 → 2657.40] Oh.
[2657.40 → 2658.40] Oh.
[2658.40 → 2659.40] Oh.
[2659.40 → 2660.40] Oh.
[2660.40 → 2661.40] Oh.
[2661.40 → 2662.40] Oh.
[2662.40 → 2663.40] What a shame.
[2663.40 → 2666.40] I think this is the last level before you get to the castle though.
[2666.40 → 2667.40] So if you can beat this fortress then you will be fine.
[2667.40 → 2670.40] Then you will actually be in the running.
[2670.40 → 2674.40] And I think you get to start at the halfway point like me as well.
[2674.40 → 2680.40] Maybe at some point I should go and do the star raid.
[2680.40 → 2682.40] so that we can get back to the uh...
[2682.40 → 2684.40] Wait, why is the top speeder there?
[2684.40 → 2686.40] What? That spins, yeah.
[2688.40 → 2690.40] I feel like it didn't hit you, I don't know why.
[2690.40 → 2692.40] This looks all like, why does Y spin?
[2694.40 → 2696.40] These things are stupid because there's so much of them
[2696.40 → 2698.40] that you're allowed to touch, and then it's just like...
[2698.40 → 2700.40] Yeah, I didn't think it was going to hurt me,
[2700.40 → 2702.40] I thought it was just stopping me.
[2702.40 → 2704.40] Yeah, the hit detection around the ends is like,
[2704.40 → 2706.40] kinda dumb.
[2706.40 → 2708.40] Um...
[2712.40 → 2714.40] So it's been kind of a long week, eh?
[2714.40 → 2716.40] What?!
[2716.40 → 2717.40] I've never seen that before.
[2717.40 → 2719.40] Someone told me you could bounce off the saws as well.
[2719.40 → 2720.40] With a spin jump?
[2720.40 → 2721.40] With a spin jump, apparently.
[2721.40 → 2722.40] Didn't know that.
[2722.40 → 2723.40] Me neither.
[2726.40 → 2727.40] Huh.
[2727.40 → 2728.40] That's interesting.
[2728.40 → 2730.40] So spin jump is more useful than I gave it to the camera.
[2730.40 → 2732.40] Spin jump is just like massively a bad...
[2732.40 → 2734.40] Well, I'll rather go that way.
[2734.40 → 2735.40] Oh no!
[2735.40 → 2737.40] That's a shame.
[2737.40 → 2738.40] Oh!
[2738.40 → 2739.40] That's lava by the way.
[2739.40 → 2740.40] It's grey!
[2740.40 → 2741.40] It's chocolate.
[2741.40 → 2742.40] Oh.
[2742.40 → 2743.40] Chocolate.
[2743.40 → 2744.40] Grey chocolate lava.
[2744.40 → 2745.40] You've never heard of grey chocolate before?
[2745.40 → 2746.40] You know what?
[2746.40 → 2750.40] I'm going to give you a chance here because I'm going to go start working on the Star Road.
[2750.40 → 2752.40] Because this is ridiculous.
[2752.40 → 2756.40] Not being able to go and get power-ups in between is kinda killing me.
[2756.40 → 2757.40] Alright.
[2757.40 → 2758.40] Back to the Star Road.
[2758.40 → 2759.40] Um.
[2759.40 → 2760.40] So yeah, this week's been kinda crazy, eh?
[2760.40 → 2761.40] We can't really talk about any of the details, guys.
[2761.40 → 2762.40] But there are a bunch of product launches.
[2762.40 → 2763.40] There's, um, Computer.
[2763.40 → 2764.40] There's, um, Computer.
[2764.40 → 2765.40] There's...
[2765.40 → 2766.40] There's...
[2766.40 → 2767.40] There's...
[2767.40 → 2768.40] There's...
[2768.40 → 2769.40] There's...
[2769.40 → 2770.40] There's...
[2770.40 → 2771.40] There's...
[2771.40 → 2772.40] There's...
[2772.40 → 2773.40] There's...
[2773.40 → 2774.40] There's...
[2774.40 → 2775.40] That build guide took forever.
[2775.40 → 2777.40] There's new forum stuff going on.
[2777.40 → 2778.40] What else has happened this week?
[2778.40 → 2779.40] Hey.
[2779.40 → 2780.40] Is Bell still here?
[2780.40 → 2781.40] I don't know.
[2781.40 → 2782.40] He's probably playing with this stuff.
[2782.40 → 2783.40] I think he is.
[2783.40 → 2784.40] He's probably playing with our new gear.
[2784.40 → 2785.40] Ugh.
[2785.40 → 2786.40] I...
[2786.40 → 2787.40] I would forget.
[2787.40 → 2791.40] I would get, like, to the end of the day and be like, wow, I had a really not so nice
[2791.40 → 2792.40] of a day.
[2792.40 → 2793.40] What did I even do?
[2793.40 → 2796.40] And then sit there for, like, a few minutes and be like, oh, I actually did a lot.
[2796.40 → 2800.40] Because I did, like, so much stuff that I kinda forgot.
[2800.40 → 2802.40] I felt like that some days as well.
[2802.40 → 2803.40] Actually, this week.
[2803.40 → 2804.40] Same thing.
[2804.40 → 2805.40] Yeah.
[2805.40 → 2808.40] It's like, what actually happened today?
[2808.40 → 2809.40] Yeah.
[2809.40 → 2810.40] I don't know.
[2810.40 → 2815.40] What's the red one doing?
[2815.40 → 2822.40] Uh, red one turns every kind of shell into a flame shell.
[2822.40 → 2823.40] Oh, yeah.
[2823.40 → 2824.40] Oh, yeah.
[2824.40 → 2825.40] Wooloo.
[2825.40 → 2827.40] That was good.
[2827.40 → 2828.40] I wanted the...
[2828.40 → 2829.40] Yeah.
[2829.40 → 2830.40] That was not that good.
[2830.40 → 2831.40] Yeah.
[2831.40 → 2832.40] Yeah.
[2832.40 → 2833.40] Yeah.
[2833.40 → 2837.40] Guys, we're gonna just ignore the chat if you're just spamming it with stupid stuff.
[2837.40 → 2838.40] So, yeah.
[2838.40 → 2841.40] Like, we're actually not going to acknowledge it.
[2841.40 → 2843.40] You don't even have the chat open.
[2843.40 → 2844.40] I used to.
[2844.40 → 2845.40] Yeah.
[2845.40 → 2846.40] Fair enough.
[2846.40 → 2847.40] I used to do the first bit, and then I had to share, uh...
[2847.40 → 2848.40] Yeah.
[2848.40 → 2849.40] ...share that document with...
[2849.40 → 2850.40] B-roll.
[2850.40 → 2851.40] Oh, right.
[2851.40 → 2852.40] Oh, right.
[2852.40 → 2855.40] I guess he's still editing that.
[2855.40 → 2856.40] I...
[2856.40 → 2857.40] I...
[2857.40 → 2858.40] I...
[2858.40 → 2861.40] I was pretty sure I had that jump and then just...
[2861.40 → 2863.40] It just stopped me at the pinnacle of the jump.
[2863.40 → 2864.40] Lucky 13 seconds in.
[2864.40 → 2865.40] Yeah.
[2865.40 → 2867.40] Yeah, that was how you knew you were lucky.
[2867.40 → 2868.40] I was pretty sure I had that jump.
[2868.40 → 2869.40] Apparently not.
[2869.40 → 2870.40] My Twitch chat stopped updating.
[2870.40 → 2871.40] Yeah, mine did that earlier today too.
[2871.40 → 2872.40] Did you just request a page and find it?
[2872.40 → 2873.40] So, speaking of Twitch chat, um, I've had a few requests from people that we start using
[2873.40 → 2874.40] YouTube's new, um, new live feature.
[2874.40 → 2875.40] Which we won't be doing by the way because we have, uh, an agreement with Twitch where we're
[2875.40 → 2876.40] using Twitch for a bit, at least.
[2876.40 → 2877.40] So, um, I don't know.
[2877.40 → 2878.40] I don't know.
[2878.40 → 2879.40] I don't know.
[2879.40 → 2880.40] I don't know.
[2880.40 → 2881.40] I don't know.
[2881.40 → 2882.40] I don't know.
[2882.40 → 2883.40] I don't know.
[2883.40 → 2884.40] I don't know.
[2884.40 → 2885.40] I don't know.
[2885.40 → 2886.40] I don't know.
[2886.40 → 2887.40] I don't know.
[2887.40 → 2888.40] I don't know.
[2888.40 → 2889.40] I don't know.
[2889.40 → 2890.40] I don't know.
[2890.40 → 2891.40] I don't know.
[2891.40 → 2892.40] I don't know.
[2892.40 → 2893.40] I don't know.
[2893.40 → 2894.40] I don't know.
[2894.40 → 2895.40] I don't know.
[2895.40 → 2896.40] I don't know.
[2896.40 → 2897.40] I don't know.
[2897.40 → 2903.40] But anyway, uh, it seems to have been upgraded significantly so it's not total, it's not
[2903.40 → 2904.40] totally horrible now.
[2904.40 → 2905.40] Apparently.
[2905.40 → 2908.40] I forget what the things they've upgraded are.
[2908.40 → 2911.40] Maybe Twitch chat remembers, and they can, uh, say something useful.
[2911.40 → 2915.40] All I see is in all capital letters, coloured ketchup.
[2915.40 → 2916.40] Coloured ketchup?
[2916.40 → 2919.40] Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what Google fits about it.
[2919.40 → 2926.40] Um, so yeah, they, uh, what's it gonna change?
[2926.40 → 2936.40] Uh, live hangouts have likes to stuff, that makes some difference.
[2936.40 → 2937.40] Hmm.
[2937.40 → 2938.40] Can't remember.
[2938.40 → 2939.40] Maybe they can remember now.
[2939.40 → 2940.40] Anyway, apparently it's better and yeah.
[2940.40 → 2942.40] It's apparently Google plus Hangouts go live.
[2942.40 → 2943.40] Yeah, they can't remember.
[2943.40 → 2944.40] I don't know.
[2944.40 → 2945.40] I don't know.
[2945.40 → 2946.40] I don't know.
[2946.40 → 2947.40] I don't know.
[2947.40 → 2948.40] I wish there was a better way to do Skype calls.
[2948.40 → 2960.40] Like I think it would actually be kind of cool if we could take live callers.
[2960.40 → 2965.40] Honestly, I think Skype could be a lot better if they just kept innovating and trying new
[2965.40 → 2966.40] things at all.
[2966.40 → 2969.40] I don't think they care because they've got, uh, what is it?
[2969.40 → 2970.40] Lynx or Lynx?
[2970.40 → 2971.40] Lynx.
[2971.40 → 2978.40] Microsoft Lynx is the pro version that does all the things that Skype probably could do,
[2978.40 → 2983.40] but it's like a professional grade software that's meant for like, uh, business conference
[2983.40 → 2985.40] calling and all that kind of stuff.
[2985.40 → 2986.40] And it's a pay product.
[2986.40 → 2990.40] So Skype's as good as they want it to be at this point, I suspect.
[2990.40 → 2991.40] No.
[2991.40 → 2995.40] There's a new startup, um, based out of somewhere.
[2995.40 → 2997.40] Like you went for giving that's not water.
[2997.40 → 2998.40] Somewhere in Europe.
[2998.40 → 2999.40] I wasn't that worried.
[2999.40 → 3001.40] Then I hit it and died, and it was crap.
[3001.40 → 3003.40] Um, they're offering cheaper rates than Skype.
[3003.40 → 3004.40] Oh wow, really?
[3004.40 → 3005.40] And, uh, they're grabbing a lot of back in.
[3005.40 → 3006.40] Because Skype is pretty cheap.
[3006.40 → 3010.40] Skype is pretty cheap, but honestly, does it need to be as expensive as it is?
[3010.40 → 3011.40] No, but it's pretty cheap.
[3011.40 → 3012.40] Okay.
[3012.40 → 3017.40] So it's, it's, it's cheap enough that like, I wouldn't necessarily complain about it.
[3017.40 → 3018.40] I don't know.
[3018.40 → 3019.40] Although, I guess that's not a reason to pee.
[3019.40 → 3020.40] Aw, shoot.
[3020.40 → 3021.40] So, wait, I think you have to wait for that to finish the thing and then hit the pee and
[3021.40 → 3022.40] then that's all we're going to do is solid.
[3022.40 → 3023.40] Yeah.
[3023.40 → 3024.40] Thank you.
[3024.40 → 3025.40] You said I shouldn't defend.
[3025.40 → 3026.40] No, I'm, I'm really close to the edge.
[3026.40 → 3027.40] And you're not.
[3027.40 → 3028.40] You're not.
[3028.40 → 3029.40] I'm not.
[3029.40 → 3030.40] I'm not.
[3030.40 → 3031.40] I'm not.
[3031.40 → 3032.40] I'm not.
[3032.40 → 3033.40] I'm not.
[3033.40 → 3034.40] It's.
[3034.40 → 3035.40] I'm not.
[3035.40 → 3036.40] I'm not.
[3036.40 → 3037.40] I'm not.
[3037.40 → 3038.40] I'm not.
[3038.40 → 3039.40] I'm not.
[3039.40 → 3040.40] I'm not.
[3040.40 → 3041.40] I'm not.
[3041.40 → 3042.40] I'm not.
[3042.40 → 3043.40] I'm not.
[3043.40 → 3048.40] I'm really close to the edge, and you have to walk in order to direct the coins.
[3048.40 → 3049.40] Oh, really?
[3049.40 → 3050.40] Yeah.
[3050.40 → 3051.40] So, maybe.
[3051.40 → 3052.40] That's all.
[3052.40 → 3055.40] I can never get this right on the first try.
[3055.40 → 3057.40] You should see it.
[3057.40 → 3059.40] Last few of the three.
[3059.40 → 3060.40] Aw.
[3060.40 → 3061.40] Whoa.
[3061.40 → 3062.40] Hello.
[3062.40 → 3063.40] Bummer.
[3063.40 → 3067.40] I think I was supposed to go further and not as hard.
[3067.40 → 3068.40] I'm not going to make it.
[3068.40 → 3069.40] Oh.
[3069.40 → 3070.40] Close.
[3070.40 → 3071.40] Too bad.
[3071.40 → 3073.40] Someone says, please answer very important.
[3073.40 → 3093.40] Is a Black Little Ultimate 2013, Razor Goliaths off the control, and a PA238Q a good combo?
[3093.40 → 3099.40] It's a strange combo because it's a keyboard, a mouse pad, and a monitor, which actually couldn't
[3099.40 → 3103.40] have less to do with each other if you tried.
[3103.40 → 3106.40] I don't know what to say.
[3106.40 → 3107.40] Really?
[3107.40 → 3108.40] Yes.
[3108.40 → 3110.40] Like at least, um, yeah, yes.
[3110.40 → 3111.40] 17.
[3111.40 → 3112.40] Um.
[3112.40 → 3121.40] I mean, at least if you had that, like if you were talking about that, oh boy.
[3121.40 → 3126.40] At least if you were talking about that Bionics mouse pad that's like the desk pad, then I
[3126.40 → 3131.40] could be like, yes, the keyboard will go well with the desk pad that it will sit on.
[3131.40 → 3133.40] But if it's like...
[3133.40 → 3136.40] Anyway, the PA238's a very big...
[3136.40 → 3138.40] Oh my goodness, that is exactly the same thing.
[3138.40 → 3139.40] That is not even a hard jump.
[3139.40 → 3140.40] I know.
[3140.40 → 3141.40] I jump way too high.
[3141.40 → 3142.40] I need to not jump as high.
[3142.40 → 3144.40] The PA238Q is not a bad monitor.
[3144.40 → 3147.40] The 23 inch isn't as good as the 24 inch.
[3147.40 → 3153.40] Um, the 24 inch has additional vertical resolution in addition to the fact that it's just generally
[3153.40 → 3154.40] better.
[3154.40 → 3158.40] We run into that a lot though because they usually charge a lot less for the 23 inch.
[3158.40 → 3159.40] Yes.
[3159.40 → 3160.40] So you get...
[3160.40 → 3163.40] I ran into that looking at AC's monitor.
[3163.40 → 3164.40] Right.
[3168.40 → 3170.40] It doesn't help that I can't hear the music right now.
[3170.40 → 3171.40] Right now.
[3171.40 → 3172.40] Now I don't think I'm going up.
[3172.40 → 3173.40] I guess it changes to...
[3173.40 → 3174.40] Oh, I see.
[3174.40 → 3175.40] You're just guessing when it starts to go up.
[3175.40 → 3176.40] Oh no, I'm pressing up.
[3176.40 → 3177.40] Oh, okay.
[3177.40 → 3193.40] Like I'm controlling it, but I can't hear the music that's controlling the thing and like,
[3193.40 → 3196.40] I don't know if I can't hear the music that's great because we don't have really any sound to speak of.
[3196.40 → 3197.40] Yeah.
[3197.40 → 3199.40] You can wear the headphones.
[3199.40 → 3200.40] Ah, okay.
[3200.40 → 3201.40] I can do it.
[3201.40 → 3202.40] I can do it.
[3202.40 → 3204.40] I think you did it.
[3208.40 → 3209.40] Oh!
[3209.40 → 3210.40] Oh!
[3210.40 → 3211.40] Wow, that was really close.
[3211.40 → 3212.40] What a shame.
[3212.40 → 3214.40] What does that bring to you?
[3214.40 → 3215.40] Ah, that's the secret exit.
[3215.40 → 3216.40] Oh, okay.
[3216.40 → 3218.40] Honestly, this exit does nothing.
[3218.40 → 3220.40] I'm just seeing if I can find any power-ups.
[3220.40 → 3221.40] Oh, okay.
[3221.40 → 3222.40] I'll get a Joshi if nothing else.
[3222.40 → 3223.40] Oh, come on.
[3223.40 → 3224.40] Yeah, I'll get a Joshi if nothing else.
[3224.40 → 3225.40] Joshi's like, sup bro?
[3225.40 → 3226.40] I'm up here.
[3226.40 → 3227.40] What do you do?
[3227.40 → 3228.40] What does a yellow Joshi do?
[3228.40 → 3230.40] Yellow Joshi, no matter what you eat, does stomp clouds.
[3230.40 → 3231.40] Oh.
[3231.40 → 3232.40] Or no matter which shell you eat, I mean.
[3232.40 → 3233.40] It's like totally unnecessary.
[3233.40 → 3234.40] It's like the most underpowered Joshi ability in the game.
[3234.40 → 3235.40] Yeah.
[3235.40 → 3236.40] Yeah.
[3236.40 → 3237.40] So dumb.
[3237.40 → 3239.40] Because your timing has to be more perfect than if you just...
[3239.40 → 3240.40] ...you just...
[3240.40 → 3241.40] ...you just...
[3241.40 → 3242.40] ...you just...
[3242.40 → 3243.40] ...you just...
[3243.40 → 3244.40] ...you just...
[3244.40 → 3245.40] ...you just...
[3245.40 → 3246.40] ...you just...
[3246.40 → 3247.40] ...you just...
[3247.40 → 3248.40] ...you just...
[3248.40 → 3249.40] ...you just...
[3249.40 → 3250.40] ...got it.
[3250.40 → 3254.40] Someone says looking for a 24-inch monitor for college.
[3254.40 → 3255.40] The fact that you're going to college doesn't...
[3255.40 → 3256.40] ...what?
[3256.40 → 3257.40] Oh, the secret exit for this one takes you to the middle.
[3257.40 → 3258.40] That's great.
[3258.40 → 3259.40] The fact that you're going to college doesn't really affect your monitor choice too much,
[3259.40 → 3260.40] I don't think.
[3260.40 → 3261.40] It's more to do with the budget and what you're going to be using it for.
[3261.40 → 3262.40] Because you could be going to college for, I don't know, an arts major.
[3262.40 → 3267.40] In which case what you'll need is a monitor that displays a screen on it.
[3267.40 → 3278.40] Or, you could be going to college for, like, graphic design.
[3278.40 → 3279.40] Can you...
[3279.40 → 3281.60] degree to make sense.
[3281.60 → 3286.40] The degree to do, like smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke person
[3286.40 → 3288.40] But, that is the most helpful.
[3288.40 → 3289.40] So, there's a reminder address.
[3289.40 → 3294.68] calibrated or like a gorgeous you know design capable panel so we really need
[3294.68 → 3299.08] more detail than that and so does twitch chat. Someone's looking for a desk?
[3299.08 → 3305.56] Honestly desks are not my strong suit.
[3305.56 → 3309.40] Use a door. I'm sorry? Use a door.
[3309.40 → 3313.40] What? Your desk. Oh, my controller is falling to the left.
[3313.40 → 3318.12] I saw it happen. I don't know why I'm having so much trouble with my level.
[3318.12 → 3322.28] It's not hard. I just keep on screen things up.
[3322.28 → 3325.72] I don't remember. I think this one you have to know where the thing is as well.
[3325.72 → 3327.48] I can't remember where it is.
[3327.48 → 3330.60] So if you jump the wrong side.
[3330.60 → 3333.80] Yeah.
[3333.80 → 3336.28] Can't hurt.
[3339.96 → 3342.60] Wow. So they just want you to take forever.
[3342.60 → 3346.04] Yeah. It's kind of fun.
[3346.04 → 3348.92] If I got rid of Joshi I'd be able to uh...
[3348.92 → 3350.28] Don't tell me what I'm looking for.
[3350.28 → 3351.80] Yeah. Actually I'd probably do that.
[3355.80 → 3357.64] And then there are stars.
[3357.64 → 3359.16] And then you can do this.
[3359.16 → 3362.20] And then I think the idea is you're supposed to get distracted
[3363.08 → 3365.08] chasing stars, and you're supposed to miss it.
[3366.44 → 3367.80] Or chasing uh one-ups.
[3367.80 → 3378.68] I don't know where it is. I thought it was on the left.
[3378.68 → 3380.68] Cock.
[3380.68 → 3382.68] Oh.
[3382.68 → 3386.68] Crap.
[3386.68 → 3389.56] That'll work.
[3389.56 → 3391.24] I'm not sure.
[3391.24 → 3394.20] Oh okay. Apparently you can miss the other scissors.
[3394.20 → 3397.24] Shoot. I think I missed it.
[3400.76 → 3403.56] Ah. Pin to the left.
[3403.56 → 3405.56] Still hasn't killed you, but it's gotten close.
[3405.56 → 3406.76] Yeah. I know right.
[3406.76 → 3408.44] I know right.
[3408.44 → 3409.40] Ah.
[3409.40 → 3410.44] I missed the trailer where it is.
[3410.44 → 3412.44] I'll have to go to the side of it.
[3412.44 → 3414.44] I hope I don't screw up this time.
[3414.44 → 3415.40] Annoying.
[3415.40 → 3418.44] I don't like this first place.
[3426.76 → 3428.44] What do you need for dinner?
[3428.44 → 3429.24] I don't know.
[3429.24 → 3431.48] I think my dad's going to take a hit.
[3431.48 → 3432.20] Oh cool.
[3435.32 → 3435.64] Okay.
[3435.64 → 3436.84] He's playing baseball again.
[3436.84 → 3437.80] Oh yeah?
[3437.80 → 3438.28] Yeah.
[3438.28 → 3444.52] The last game I went to it took um oh my god I always think I can make that jump.
[3445.72 → 3446.68] So annoying.
[3446.68 → 3448.84] It took forever for him to be able to get to the field.
[3448.84 → 3453.48] He finally gets to the field, and he's going up to bat and just kills it.
[3453.48 → 3455.32] Like most of the hits are really, really boring.
[3455.32 → 3461.48] My dad goes up and just destroys it, but it goes on this like huge arc, and I'm like uh oh.
[3461.48 → 3464.60] Because there are people way out there that usually just do absolutely nothing because no
[3464.60 → 3466.04] one's doing it very well.
[3466.04 → 3469.16] Um just right into someone's mitt.
[3469.16 → 3471.88] I was like WWW it's the only time you have to go to bat.
[3471.88 → 3473.00] That's no fun.
[3473.00 → 3473.80] No fun at all.
[3477.80 → 3480.28] It's like oh that's going to go next.
[3481.00 → 3483.24] Yeah it sucks to be like way too good right?
[3483.24 → 3488.52] Someone asks what are your thoughts on the Samsung 840 the TLC version?
[3490.84 → 3491.96] What's your take on it?
[3491.96 → 3492.76] It's nice and cheap.
[3492.76 → 3493.96] It's still really, really fast.
[3493.96 → 3494.92] Yeah it's really cheap.
[3494.92 → 3501.40] Um writes aren't that insane but uh at least for my use case I wouldn't need writes nearly as much.
[3501.40 → 3502.52] I'm not as worried about it.
[3502.52 → 3508.04] I mean people get really worried about the whole limited number of writes that an SSD can withstand but
[3508.84 → 3511.88] honestly it really doesn't feel like that much of a concern to me.
[3511.88 → 3516.68] Like I have a huge RAID 0 SSD array which is like stupid but
[3519.32 → 3521.80] I'm not worried about it because I don't write to it much.
[3521.80 → 3524.68] Yeah I don't write too much, and you can check with a lot of them.
[3524.68 → 3529.88] You can get them a lot of them will have uh software that come with it that can check like
[3530.36 → 3533.72] basically I've done this many writes this is how long until I'll die.
[3533.72 → 3538.68] Yeah exactly. A lot of them don't work when you're running in mode for example.
[3538.68 → 3543.64] So I can't monitor it but like it just doesn't seem like that much of a concern.
[3544.36 → 3552.12] Um because think about how much data you actually write on a consumer computer unless you're using
[3552.12 → 3562.04] your SSD as like um a scratch disk or unless you're for some reason like yeah a server like
[3562.04 → 3567.80] a transactional database server or something stupid like that in which case you better not be buying
[3567.80 → 3573.24] a consumer grade SSD because the enterprise grade stuff will last many times longer. There is no
[3574.76 → 3583.16] good reason why you would actually you can go right to the edge and go.
[3583.16 → 3594.12] Um yeah and they'll last many times longer than the consumer grade ones, so I don't know.
[3594.12 → 3596.36] If you're concerned about it, you can always get an 840 Pro.
[3597.88 → 3599.88] You can stay there you can just back there and go over here.
[3601.56 → 3604.84] Yeah it's weird because if you look at his... what are you doing? Stay there. Yeah, there you go.
[3604.84 → 3610.52] Okay well. I was trying to be fast that was apparently a terrible idea.
[3612.76 → 3617.32] The good news is you can go down there and get things. I think it's the middle one.
[3618.52 → 3619.08] Okay.
[3619.08 → 3636.36] There you go. There you got lots of time. Um someone asked what about page file virtual memory
[3636.36 → 3640.12] writing? If you have a decent amount of memory I really can't imagine that your page file is being
[3640.12 → 3646.60] used that much. Um and if you don't like same thing like if you don't reboot all the time I don't
[3646.60 → 3650.44] imagine it's going to be moved around that much if you cut yeah you can get both of them.
[3650.44 → 3651.80] That's probably used as well.
[3651.80 → 3652.28] Oh okay.
[3657.80 → 3660.76] Who else, what's my dream car? A bike?
[3660.76 → 3671.72] Okay. I guess. What's your dream car?
[3675.48 → 3679.08] Yeah I don't know. I have a lot of cars that I like, but they're all so different.
[3680.28 → 3683.08] You can taunt him by jumping out and then angling back.
[3683.08 → 3694.60] Maybe just try and make it. Oh, there you go. But yeah I um I don't know I'm not really much of a car
[3694.60 → 3700.52] guy. I drive my super civic. It gets me from point A to point B. It's all I've ever really asked for.
[3700.52 → 3706.04] I think even if I had a lot of money I wouldn't buy an expensive car. It's just not a priority for me.
[3707.32 → 3711.64] Oh you ran out of time. There are a lot of things that I'd rather have than
[3713.08 → 3715.64] than expensive. Yeah, people are like 15 seconds, 5 seconds.
[3715.64 → 3720.44] Without the music I don't pay attention to the actual timer. I was not rushing because I was
[3720.44 → 3724.28] like yeah whatever I'm doing fine. I didn't even think about it. Without the music it's weird.
[3724.92 → 3731.48] I don't know like there's so many cars it just feels like it feels like the manufacturer just
[3731.48 → 3735.72] made it because they could not because there was any kind of practical reason for it.
[3735.72 → 3740.84] Yeah but then we're in the computer hardware. That's true. And so much of what makes a car like
[3740.84 → 3746.28] awesome it doesn't actually make it that different from another car. Like for example the whole
[3746.28 → 3753.40] it goes back to the whole Toyota Lexus Honda Acura thing. Okay Acer Gateway.
[3753.40 → 3760.84] Acer Gateway. No okay not just that but just okay where it's actually built on the same platform.
[3760.84 → 3769.64] Right. Like that to me is like yeah same chassis same engine, but it has liked you know an authentic
[3769.64 → 3774.52] wood trim or whatever. That doesn't have a meaning for me. But some people would. You would like a
[3774.52 → 3780.12] computer that had like Titan and one of the reasons why it's so cool is because the heat
[3780.12 → 3787.64] thing that comes on is so boss because it looks so boss. Okay all right. It's just that
[3788.92 → 3794.44] I think I'm probably a little bit more into cars than you. Probably. It's pretty hard to be less
[3794.44 → 3801.08] into cars than me. Yeah, but we're still both not like I wouldn't call myself a car guy. Yeah. So we don't
[3801.08 → 3806.60] see the value in it as much as other people do. I still enjoy like I like cars, but I'm just I
[3806.60 → 3811.08] don't know enough about it to be like oh I'm a car guy I like this car like that car. I have a few
[3811.08 → 3817.40] cars that I like a lot. I like Fox 8 because I find them interesting. They're terrible on gas. The
[3817.40 → 3823.16] wanker engine? Wanker. Wanker. Wanker. Pretty sure it's Wanker. Wanker. Interesting it's a very cool
[3823.16 → 3825.32] car. It's horrible on gas. It's horrible on a bunch of other things, but it's a very cool car. You
[3825.32 → 3831.00] looked at that phone on Wikipedia. It was Wanker. Wanker. Wanker. Wanker. Wanker.
[3833.88 → 3841.88] Um I like ancient like Charger RTs and like dusters and super bees and stuff. You should go so
[3841.88 → 3850.52] that you don't die. Um but like I just like those because they're huge. Right. I don't know if I'd
[3850.52 → 3855.88] ever actually want to have one. I don't know. Furthermore, I mean my mom has a really cool car. She's got a 69
[3855.88 → 3862.04] Beaumont. Right. Which is kind of like it's a Chevelle basically, and it was a Canadian
[3862.04 → 3867.08] made car which is kind of neat and like I can understand it, but it's like it's funny because
[3867.08 → 3871.48] I don't know people who get really into old cars like muscle cars and stuff like that is kind of
[3871.48 → 3878.84] You like retro games. Yeah, I like retro games. Okay, okay hold on. Because she was all like blah
[3878.84 → 3884.44] blah blah it has this many horsepower. I'm like yeah that's cool. Um you know my bike cost a small
[3884.44 → 3895.00] fraction of what that did and goes way faster and consumes less gas and I look really cool when I ride
[3895.00 → 3899.96] it and and and and and and and and and although you look pretty cool driving an older
[3899.96 → 3905.16] car as well. Like every once in a while I'll see something in uh I'll see something in traffic and
[3905.16 → 3914.36] I'll just be like yeah that's really cool. D-pad makes me angry sometimes. Yeah, I agree. Um I don't know.
[3915.24 → 3920.04] But then at the same time speed of engineering. And like oh high performance bikes are so cool
[3920.04 → 3928.60] because like they um oh, oh come on oh, oh high performance bikes are cool because they cost
[3928.60 → 3939.08] practically nothing compared to high performance cars. I can't remember what is happening. Oh
[3943.08 → 3949.96] uh I killed him well crap, and it's pinned to the left uh because the thing about high performance
[3949.96 → 3954.12] bikes and someone made it's pinned to the left I'm going to die. That's going to be the first time. No!
[3955.72 → 3956.20] Oh!
[3959.64 → 3964.52] Ah! There you go. Okay. Okay I got this. Um
[3968.04 → 3976.84] Wow. So like anyway. Oh, that's not really what I meant to do. Okay let's wait for him to come back.
[3977.40 → 3984.12] Because yeah you can get a super high performance bike for like 50 grand. Whereas in the context of car
[3984.12 → 3990.60] and it'll outperform pretty much any car. Yeah. Which to me is way more practical. So cars just yeah
[3990.60 → 3998.52] they just don't feel oh I didn't like for him to go to the right spot. Ah! A lot of cars with um like really really really light
[3998.52 → 4005.80] cars that you wouldn't necessarily call street cars even though they can be. Um with bike engines are
[4005.80 → 4015.08] faster than other normal cars. Okay. Have you seen that or heard of that? Uh not particularly. Because they're super light and the bike engine is super light. You know what I want to try though?
[4015.08 → 4020.84] Have you seen those things that have two front wheels and one back one? Yeah. There's uh there's a dude that lives like three
[4020.84 → 4026.52] doors down from my parents. He has one? Yeah. I've heard they're just whenever I go hang out at their house
[4026.52 → 4035.40] every once in a while. I've heard they're actually less stable than a bike. Yeah, because bikes
[4035.40 → 4043.88] have the benefit of gyroscopic stability whereas that thing does not. Hey B roll. Is everything working
[4043.88 → 4052.20] okay? Is it awesome? Yeah. Is it way more comfortable? Oh, you didn't try the shoulder rig? Oh, you've just been editing?
[4052.84 → 4056.92] Oh so you're going to be working on that now. Are you going to go home at some point? Yeah.
[4059.80 → 4063.08] This food is important. Yeah. I need food too.
[4065.40 → 4068.60] Food's good. I like food. I'm going to crouch this time. Furthermore, I was doing good.
[4069.40 → 4072.04] Someone says canna and spiders are for people with no worms.
[4074.36 → 4078.44] I will have a budget to get... Oh my goodness. I almost just killed myself by crouching again.
[4080.28 → 4085.72] Like when in doubt like stop drop and roll. Well no it's I'm pressing right. It's like volcano.
[4085.72 → 4086.44] Stop drop and roll.
[4086.44 → 4087.64] I don't know your Czech.
[4087.64 → 4097.56] Didn't happen to me.
[4097.56 → 4100.90] Yeah, the adapter should be here soon.
[4101.56 → 4104.46] Oh, we've had a bit of a disaster at Linus Media Group.
[4105.10 → 4112.92] Our cheap lens adapter from Sony to Canon has been destroying the contact points on lenses.
[4113.34 → 4117.84] So we're going to look into seeing if we can get a couple of Diesel's lens contacts replaced.
[4117.84 → 4119.66] I don't know if it actually works that way.
[4120.52 → 4125.18] And if it doesn't, then I guess I'm on the hook for some lenses here.
[4125.18 → 4130.20] And so we have a new adapter that costs triple what the old one did coming.
[4131.40 → 4136.48] But, yeah, not thrilled about that situation.
[4136.92 → 4146.60] So it was like $600 for what's basically a fancy chunk of metal, and you did, that adapts from one point to another one.
[4146.60 → 4155.00] Like we were saying in the live stream, these high-end, professional-grade production things is just...
[4155.00 → 4159.60] Oh, it's like criminal how much money...
[4159.60 → 4169.90] Like, it comes down to the bomb cost conversation, where it's like a Galaxy S4 only costs $237 in terms of the actual materials.
[4169.98 → 4174.26] So, yeah, the materials for manufacturing one of these lens things might be absolutely nothing.
[4174.64 → 4175.82] Or like practically nothing.
[4175.82 → 4183.90] But there was actually design that went into it, which, you know, you have to appreciate as well.
[4184.00 → 4185.54] But still, it just kind of kills me.
[4186.38 → 4191.54] The amount of money that we spend on hunts of metal that just mount stuff to stuff.
[4191.96 → 4195.20] Although what's cool about the ones we're getting, or the one we're getting is...
[4195.20 → 4196.00] What's it called, B-roll?
[4196.26 → 4197.66] It's called a Metabones Speed Booster.
[4197.66 → 4199.78] It's called a Metabones Speed Booster.
[4200.26 → 4206.56] And what it does is it effectively increases the amount of light transmission that actually gets to the sensor on the camera.
[4207.14 → 4212.16] It also widens the field of view on your stock lens.
[4212.16 → 4216.88] So you can get away with cheaper, crappier lenses by using this Speed Booster thing.
[4218.38 → 4221.20] And so, yeah, I thought that was pretty cool.
[4221.20 → 4228.88] So at least I'm getting some benefit out of it other than just, you know, physically adapting the thing to the other thing.
[4232.32 → 4240.52] Yeah, it's not as simple as getting them to see and see an adapter because when you want to adjust the aperture of your lens, there are controls on the camera.
[4240.62 → 4243.70] So there's actual electronics inside as well.
[4244.02 → 4247.20] Adapters are a little bit more complicated than what we were talking about on the live stream.
[4247.28 → 4250.22] On the live stream, we were talking about, like, really basic.
[4250.22 → 4251.52] Yeah, really basic stuff.
[4251.72 → 4253.84] Like a few metal bars with a weight on it.
[4254.04 → 4254.66] How much was that?
[4255.44 → 4255.80] $600?
[4256.48 → 4256.88] $500?
[4258.50 → 4258.90] Yeah.
[4259.16 → 4259.60] $850?
[4259.62 → 4260.06] $850.
[4260.32 → 4262.82] Like, it's actually just a few metal bars with a weight on it.
[4262.90 → 4263.14] Yeah.
[4264.30 → 4265.02] Kind of beautiful.
[4265.14 → 4266.82] It's precision manufactured, mind you.
[4267.00 → 4267.26] Yep.
[4267.38 → 4269.14] You can precision manufacture it with the O.
[4269.96 → 4270.24] O.
[4270.24 → 4270.30] Oh.
[4270.54 → 4270.66] Oh.
[4272.08 → 4274.46] Someone asks, Linus, what should I get?
[4274.56 → 4276.32] A GTX 680 or two?
[4276.58 → 4278.18] I'm getting new 3D vision setups.
[4278.18 → 4281.02] Should I get two GTX 680s or two GTX 780s?
[4281.06 → 4282.60] Why would you even ask me a question like that?
[4282.66 → 4283.74] What's a GTX 780?
[4285.84 → 4286.44] B-roll.
[4286.60 → 4286.82] Shh.
[4289.32 → 4289.58] Uh.
[4292.88 → 4293.78] Stuff and things.
[4293.84 → 4294.06] Yeah.
[4294.44 → 4296.32] Obviously, I can't tell you anything.
[4296.68 → 4297.56] Even if I knew.
[4299.98 → 4301.70] You know how I usually display that?
[4301.78 → 4303.14] Even if I knew, which I don't.
[4305.52 → 4306.48] Reading between the lines.
[4306.48 → 4308.00] Reading between the lines.
[4308.96 → 4309.48] So, yeah.
[4309.54 → 4313.78] You'll have to figure out what makes the most sense for you when you have all the information
[4313.78 → 4319.16] you need, which is going to be pricing and performance of these hypothetical things that
[4319.16 → 4320.96] I guess might or might not exist.
[4321.04 → 4322.78] You had a mushroom up in the top the whole time.
[4323.54 → 4323.72] Yeah.
[4324.86 → 4325.52] I live on the edge.
[4327.20 → 4328.72] I actually had no idea.
[4328.72 → 4330.26] Oh.
[4334.68 → 4335.36] Oh, man.
[4336.08 → 4336.92] Oh, do I have to go?
[4336.92 → 4339.14] Yeah, just go on one of the things and just fight him from the other.
[4339.20 → 4339.90] Don't do that.
[4339.96 → 4340.70] What are you doing?
[4342.22 → 4343.62] Are you high?
[4343.70 → 4344.50] I've never done this.
[4344.56 → 4346.74] Just wait until you're under him when he goes up the other side.
[4346.80 → 4350.28] You just have to dodge the fireballs, which he shouldn't be able to hit you with if you're
[4350.28 → 4350.48] moving.
[4350.48 → 4353.58] So you have to pop him and then land it.
[4355.06 → 4359.64] The only thing that makes Tenor hard is the fact that the platform disappears.
[4359.64 → 4362.14] I thought you could get them all without jumping on the one.
[4362.14 → 4363.98] You can, but you have to ninja it.
[4364.02 → 4364.38] Oh, okay.
[4370.72 → 4372.72] Someone says it's a life or death situation.
[4372.92 → 4377.40] I need a good pain ADP monitor for Cherry MX something.
[4377.68 → 4378.38] It's all in caps.
[4378.48 → 4379.08] It's hard to read.
[4379.22 → 4379.64] It's a shout-out.
[4379.64 → 4381.86] Wait, he needs a Cherry MX keyboard and it's life or death?
[4381.88 → 4382.60] It's life or death.
[4382.84 → 4383.24] Yeah, yeah.
[4383.28 → 4383.48] Okay.
[4386.56 → 4388.28] I'm going to go ahead and ignore that right now.
[4388.92 → 4390.34] I love keyboards, man.
[4390.74 → 4392.06] But that's not life or death.
[4393.02 → 4396.00] I've used gel cat keywords before, and I didn't enjoy it, but I did it.
[4396.52 → 4402.72] Life or death is an actual thing that has an actual meaning that actually means it could
[4402.72 → 4404.60] be the difference between life or death.
[4405.06 → 4409.90] You know how you and I always comment about how the forum's awesome and people will go
[4409.90 → 4411.32] on there and people will answer your question?
[4411.50 → 4411.72] Yes.
[4411.88 → 4412.88] I got a PM on the forum.
[4412.94 → 4413.78] I answered the guy's question.
[4413.78 → 4419.60] I got a PM on the forum with some guy going, I know you said this, but I have a question.
[4419.92 → 4421.22] I don't think people are going to answer it.
[4421.22 → 4425.54] So I answered him, but in my head I'm like, dude, people will answer this question.
[4425.60 → 4427.34] And it was like a pretty good question.
[4427.86 → 4428.12] Right.
[4428.48 → 4433.82] It was about his laptop had a screen attached by someone else and then brightness settings
[4433.82 → 4435.22] were reversed and some weird stuff.
[4435.42 → 4437.66] And he was like, do you think he might have installed it incorrectly?
[4437.66 → 4439.26] I was like, that's possible.
[4441.02 → 4441.78] I don't know.
[4441.90 → 4443.08] I would kind of need to see your laptop.
[4443.40 → 4443.80] I don't know.
[4443.88 → 4449.92] My thing is people, people sometimes do message me and I just say, okay, go post in the forum
[4449.92 → 4452.34] and then if you don't get an answer, then I can try and help you.
[4452.76 → 4456.64] But nine times out of 10, if there wasn't anyone in the forum who could give an answer,
[4456.64 → 4458.60] I usually don't know the answer either.
[4459.46 → 4460.34] To be honest, yeah.
[4460.48 → 4462.02] We have some pretty crazy guys in the forum.
[4462.58 → 4467.22] And we have a lot of guys that if they don't know the question, we'll do amazing amounts
[4467.22 → 4469.04] of research and figure out the answer.
[4469.46 → 4471.12] Which is actually really cool.
[4471.30 → 4471.46] Yeah.
[4471.46 → 4478.02] And is, again, one of the things that makes our forum just amazing and awesome and everyone
[4478.02 → 4479.42] on it is just a boss.
[4479.80 → 4480.06] Yep.
[4480.40 → 4482.30] That post by Khan blew my mind.
[4482.40 → 4484.42] And there's people that have done game giveaways.
[4485.14 → 4488.92] But when he gave away the first game and then a bunch of people were like, we forgot to do
[4488.92 → 4491.08] the meme prize giveaway.
[4491.62 → 4492.88] Okay, we'll have to do it next week.
[4493.00 → 4494.46] I sent you my finalists.
[4494.46 → 4496.34] And you haven't looked at it.
[4496.42 → 4497.06] No, I narrowed it down.
[4497.16 → 4497.48] Did you?
[4497.58 → 4497.70] Yeah.
[4497.70 → 4498.02] Oh, okay.
[4498.16 → 4499.82] I didn't email you back, but I have narrowed it down.
[4499.82 → 4504.10] There was the one with you back when you did the live streams by yourself.
[4504.30 → 4504.94] I don't remember what you've seen.
[4504.94 → 4505.48] Ah, crap.
[4505.54 → 4505.94] I missed one.
[4506.14 → 4507.04] But do you remember that picture?
[4507.50 → 4507.82] Yes.
[4508.20 → 4509.86] That one was one of the ones that I voted for.
[4510.50 → 4512.68] Another, I can't remember the other ones.
[4512.92 → 4514.04] That one was one of them.
[4514.38 → 4516.72] The other, there was, there was one of, there was that one of just you.
[4516.84 → 4517.62] There was one of just me.
[4517.70 → 4520.10] And then there was one of you and me.
[4520.10 → 4526.00] And I think I nominated another one, which was the, the Morgan one, the Star Wars thing.
[4526.30 → 4528.20] Oh, I had that one in my finalists, I think.
[4528.24 → 4528.92] Oh, I didn't see it.
[4528.92 → 4530.90] Unless I screwed up and didn't, uh, didn't have it.
[4530.92 → 4533.28] I didn't see it, so I, it might have been there.
[4533.38 → 4534.42] That one's awesome.
[4534.54 → 4535.10] I love that one.
[4535.14 → 4539.96] Yeah, the Star Wars poster with, like, uh, Diesel as Princess Leia.
[4540.42 → 4541.04] What the?
[4541.84 → 4542.24] Okay.
[4542.64 → 4544.32] I'm sorry?
[4545.92 → 4546.28] Nightmares.
[4546.38 → 4547.52] Yeah, I would have nightmares, too.
[4547.52 → 4550.04] Diesel's face on Princess Leia.
[4550.16 → 4552.62] Like, back when Carrie Fisher, you know, had a body.
[4553.56 → 4554.82] Like, put Diesel's face on it.
[4554.86 → 4556.42] It's, like, not good at all.
[4557.82 → 4560.42] And it's, like, not a flattering picture of Diesel, either.
[4560.98 → 4562.24] No, not at all.
[4562.88 → 4563.42] Poor Diesel.
[4564.00 → 4564.44] Oh!
[4564.86 → 4565.36] That's cool.
[4565.38 → 4565.90] Oh, no.
[4565.90 → 4568.76] I've never seen or done this level.
[4569.46 → 4570.80] 100% never done it.
[4571.10 → 4571.28] Ever.
[4571.82 → 4574.04] Most of these, I'm like, oh, okay, I did this forever ago.
[4574.36 → 4575.88] Someone says 300 bucks to spend.
[4575.96 → 4577.08] What graphics card did you get?
[4578.80 → 4579.96] Single graphics card?
[4580.22 → 4580.56] 79.
[4580.56 → 4580.86] $79.50?
[4580.86 → 4584.54] Yeah, you can get that for 300 bucks.
[4585.40 → 4586.32] Wait for a good sale?
[4586.84 → 4587.50] Yeah, maybe so.
[4587.56 → 4589.02] Because I think they're, like, three night games.
[4589.90 → 4594.66] But if you find a perfect sale, get, like, all the games, which is awesome.
[4594.98 → 4595.24] Right.
[4595.40 → 4596.30] And it's a beast card.
[4596.40 → 4597.06] I love that card.
[4597.60 → 4599.36] Yeah, it overclocks really, really well.
[4599.40 → 4600.06] So well.
[4600.60 → 4603.40] Someone wants to know what happened with the Intel chip and gigabyte board giveaway.
[4603.52 → 4605.12] That was, like, ages ago.
[4605.30 → 4608.06] Yeah, that's been done for a while.
[4608.06 → 4609.12] That's been done for a while.
[4610.86 → 4613.58] Are you putting together the counterweight thing?
[4614.14 → 4615.82] Is it done or is it, like, good?
[4616.14 → 4616.62] No, it's good.
[4616.88 → 4617.28] Is it good?
[4617.44 → 4617.64] Okay.
[4618.72 → 4619.88] I heard that's annoying.
[4620.10 → 4620.70] That's my angel.
[4620.84 → 4621.72] Oh.
[4624.10 → 4624.78] Oh, wow.
[4625.12 → 4625.40] Okay.
[4628.92 → 4630.40] Oh, did I just open a level?
[4630.66 → 4631.50] I don't know what I'm going to do.
[4632.06 → 4633.68] I was just trying to go down the star road.
[4633.70 → 4634.02] I was wondering.
[4634.08 → 4635.96] I was like, oh, there's something I really don't know about.
[4636.54 → 4637.16] Yeah, no, no.
[4637.16 → 4637.78] Star road.
[4637.92 → 4639.18] Star road is star road.
[4640.86 → 4643.74] I wonder if I could beat all the special levels before you beat the game.
[4644.00 → 4644.24] Maybe.
[4645.38 → 4647.12] Because have you ever even done the ghost ship?
[4648.68 → 4649.72] I've beaten the game.
[4649.88 → 4650.90] I don't know why I don't remember this level.
[4651.16 → 4652.52] Remember, I beat it two players.
[4652.92 → 4655.02] So there are levels that I've never played before.
[4655.28 → 4655.80] Right, okay.
[4657.72 → 4658.80] Because I played it with my dad.
[4658.92 → 4660.50] So, like, my dad probably did this level.
[4660.72 → 4662.44] But I don't remember these floating platform things.
[4662.44 → 4664.20] These sketch me out a little bit.
[4664.30 → 4666.90] Because it feels like, because they're slanted, that...
[4666.90 → 4668.00] That you should slide off!
[4668.22 → 4670.94] But you actually just land on them like nothing else.
[4671.28 → 4671.70] Or like...
[4671.70 → 4671.86] Like...
[4671.86 → 4676.32] It's kind of a different feel than anything else in the game.
[4677.28 → 4677.60] Yeah.
[4677.78 → 4680.12] Because most sliding surfaces in the game, you slide.
[4680.58 → 4681.22] Not these.
[4681.68 → 4682.52] I would put it on that.
[4682.64 → 4682.96] Or that.
[4682.96 → 4686.32] Oh, right.
[4687.90 → 4689.04] Do I go on that thing down there?
[4689.06 → 4689.98] Go low, but go fast.
[4691.30 → 4691.90] There you go.
[4692.88 → 4695.02] I think there's probably a charging tuck up here somewhere.
[4696.76 → 4697.74] Why do you bother?
[4697.94 → 4698.64] Like, you've already missed some.
[4698.64 → 4699.32] I was looking.
[4699.54 → 4700.70] I'm trying to get a...
[4700.70 → 4702.60] No, I was wondering if there was, like, power-ups or something.
[4702.60 → 4703.34] Oh, okay.
[4703.34 → 4704.22] I don't care about...
[4704.22 → 4707.46] I'm doing pretty bad for power-ups.
[4707.56 → 4708.54] Should I go try and get those?
[4709.02 → 4709.66] Ah, no.
[4710.06 → 4711.72] No, there's a bunch of one-ups down there, but it doesn't matter.
[4711.72 → 4712.96] We have as many one-ups as we need.
[4713.00 → 4713.68] I have, like, 60.
[4714.24 → 4715.36] I think you have more than that, actually.
[4715.42 → 4717.20] You can transfer them to each other as much as you want.
[4717.22 → 4718.12] I think you have, like...
[4718.12 → 4720.72] Someone asked when the new place is going to be...
[4721.42 → 4724.50] When the new place is going to be going and what the plans are for it.
[4725.00 → 4729.22] Well, the plan is to turn it into a proper headquarters for Linus Media Group.
[4730.52 → 4736.44] To the point where, like, we'll have, you know, a proper place to sit and stream.
[4736.44 → 4741.50] And we'll have a place where, you know, Diesel's workstation can be.
[4741.72 → 4743.78] And he's not in a garage.
[4744.20 → 4745.72] And we'll have, like...
[4746.40 → 4751.72] I want to have a proper green screen so that when we do things, like, fast as possible...
[4751.72 → 4760.60] We don't have to worry about trying to key out a white background, which was, in retrospect,
[4760.84 → 4764.04] not that wise of a thing to do with that wall that I built.
[4764.04 → 4765.64] So, yeah, I want a green screen.
[4766.64 → 4769.70] Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that I want to do.
[4771.36 → 4773.08] I'm happy I made it through that small.
[4773.92 → 4774.14] Yeah.
[4774.14 → 4774.98] I don't want to have any power-ups.
[4776.30 → 4777.00] Good work.
[4777.16 → 4777.46] Yeah.
[4778.00 → 4779.26] You are a beast.
[4779.38 → 4781.00] That mission was actually really easy.
[4781.00 → 4785.10] Oh, people are asking when's your switch to BlackBerry update coming.
[4788.56 → 4790.44] Oh, it's uploaded now, right?
[4790.68 → 4791.48] Is it up, B-Roll?
[4791.82 → 4793.00] Oh, it's not up, apparently.
[4793.10 → 4794.66] B-Roll's going to upload it very, very soon.
[4795.52 → 4795.70] Hmm.
[4795.70 → 4803.16] This next BlackBerry switched is a continuation of the general user experience.
[4803.68 → 4807.40] So the next one will be, like, sideloading Android apps and doing all that kind of stuff.
[4808.16 → 4813.46] So if what you're more interested in is how well it sideloads Android apps and stuff like
[4813.46 → 4816.36] that, you might not be that interested in the next switch.
[4816.94 → 4817.62] Yeah, that's good.
[4817.64 → 4819.28] That's a good way to drive more viewership, Slick.
[4819.76 → 4822.66] I was going to explain more of the rest of the video.
[4822.66 → 4823.16] Yeah.
[4824.34 → 4825.68] Like, how fired are you right now?
[4825.78 → 4827.10] On a scale of 1 to 10.
[4827.32 → 4827.62] Zero.
[4827.76 → 4828.32] Here's a hint.
[4828.92 → 4829.24] 10.
[4830.02 → 4830.80] That's not a hint.
[4832.40 → 4833.54] That's a terrible hint.
[4834.96 → 4836.40] It's a terrible thing to be fired.
[4838.88 → 4840.44] I don't even know what I was going to say.
[4840.92 → 4842.34] I was going to say good things about the video.
[4842.66 → 4846.34] You were going to say good things about the video that's coming later.
[4846.48 → 4846.90] Oh, crap.
[4847.18 → 4848.62] No, the one that's currently there.
[4848.84 → 4849.42] I was going to justify a reason.
[4849.42 → 4849.96] Oh, okay, fine.
[4850.00 → 4850.64] What's good about it?
[4851.12 → 4851.38] Well,
[4851.38 → 4855.72] I used it quite a bit in that little experience.
[4856.06 → 4856.16] So,
[4856.34 → 4858.92] even though you can sideload Android apps and stuff,
[4859.00 → 4861.08] you should still know the general use case of the phone.
[4861.74 → 4861.86] So,
[4861.96 → 4864.38] if all you're really interested in is a sideloaded Android app,
[4864.46 → 4866.34] I would still check out the current video.
[4866.98 → 4869.08] What does your overall take on it so far?
[4869.18 → 4870.80] Would you switch to Android tomorrow?
[4871.24 → 4873.34] If someone offered you a free Zed pen
[4873.34 → 4875.10] in exchange for your S3.
[4875.34 → 4875.44] No.
[4875.44 → 4878.24] Would you consider it?
[4880.06 → 4880.80] Not really.
[4881.00 → 4883.34] Is there a scenario where you would consider it?
[4883.34 → 4889.30] If I can have both phones.
[4890.60 → 4891.96] And that's actually a legitimate thing.
[4892.08 → 4892.82] And I'm not just saying that.
[4892.88 → 4894.28] I would actually carry both phones.
[4894.94 → 4898.84] Because the Blackberry's hub is just absolutely amazing.
[4898.84 → 4900.50] But in my opinion,
[4900.60 → 4902.02] it doesn't have that much else going for it.
[4902.60 → 4902.82] Okay.
[4902.90 → 4904.20] But the hub is great.
[4904.20 → 4904.62] So,
[4904.68 → 4908.38] if I wanted to check updates on any type of notification I could possibly have,
[4908.58 → 4909.50] I would pull up the Blackberry.
[4910.50 → 4914.50] If I wanted to do stuff that doesn't have to do with social media or general notifications,
[4914.70 → 4915.44] I would pull up my S3.
[4915.96 → 4916.28] Right.
[4916.36 → 4916.58] Okay.
[4921.86 → 4922.54] Someone says,
[4922.62 → 4923.58] with Haswell coming out,
[4923.62 → 4924.88] should I wait to build my PC?
[4925.50 → 4925.90] Obviously,
[4926.10 → 4927.44] I can't say anything about that.
[4927.48 → 4931.74] But what I can say is that Tom's Hardware did a preview of Haswell performance.
[4932.42 → 4933.68] And Google is your friend.
[4933.68 → 4936.34] If you want to know what Haswell pricing is going to be like.
[4937.26 → 4941.02] And if you want to know the performance of the current generation stuff,
[4941.14 → 4942.90] then that should be blindingly obvious.
[4943.62 → 4946.86] And if you want to know the prices of the current generation stuff,
[4946.94 → 4948.36] that should be blindingly obvious too.
[4948.86 → 4949.14] So,
[4949.30 → 4950.60] I can't tell you yet.
[4951.16 → 4952.84] But what I can tell you is,
[4952.98 → 4953.14] yeah,
[4953.18 → 4953.78] it ain't that hard.
[4958.28 → 4958.60] Wow.
[4960.10 → 4961.46] And I didn't get the top one.
[4961.46 → 4962.76] Just wow.
[4963.68 → 4965.68] Awesome.
[4965.68 → 4966.16] Awesome.
[4967.26 → 4968.02] That was great.
[4968.14 → 4968.88] You're my hero.
[4969.10 → 4970.06] I'm my hero too.
[4971.02 → 4972.20] I think you're everyone's hero.
[4972.66 → 4972.92] Yep.
[4974.20 → 4974.52] B-World,
[4974.60 → 4975.56] do you want to just move in here?
[4977.14 → 4978.44] To give you guys some idea,
[4978.54 → 4980.06] he started at 8.30 this morning.
[4980.14 → 4981.36] It is now 7.40.
[4981.36 → 4985.74] And he has not shown the slightest indication that he intends to leave my house.
[4988.24 → 4990.26] When we're carpooling to the new place,
[4990.32 → 4991.46] you're leaving one time.
[4992.24 → 4993.64] I hope so.
[4993.64 → 4997.60] Because I'm not staying.
[4997.60 → 5000.44] Someone asks,
[5000.60 → 5002.60] could you use a 690 with a 680?
[5003.10 → 5003.62] No,
[5003.70 → 5004.14] you can.
[5004.60 → 5009.04] AMD does allow the use of different graphics cards together.
[5009.04 → 5014.28] So you can use a 7,990 with a 7,970 in three-way crossfire.
[5014.80 → 5017.66] But Nvidia does not allow that to be done.
[5018.00 → 5020.72] You must use matching graphics cards.
[5022.00 → 5023.50] So 680 with 680,
[5023.60 → 5024.62] 690 with 690,
[5025.10 → 5026.04] two-way SLI,
[5026.16 → 5027.38] or four-way SLI.
[5027.38 → 5028.22] Oh,
[5028.22 → 5028.70] and 680.
[5029.90 → 5030.52] Someone says,
[5030.60 → 5030.84] Linus,
[5030.90 → 5031.66] be more hospitable.
[5032.20 → 5032.60] Um,
[5032.80 → 5033.06] B-World,
[5033.14 → 5033.90] want to get us a snack?
[5035.06 → 5035.34] Oh wait,
[5035.38 → 5036.20] that's sort of the opposite.
[5037.46 → 5038.62] Get your employee,
[5039.08 → 5040.56] who's outside his hours,
[5040.70 → 5042.26] trying to get more used to the new equipment,
[5042.48 → 5045.30] to go get you a snack while you're playing a video game.
[5046.76 → 5047.16] Hey,
[5047.22 → 5048.46] playing video games is hard.
[5048.70 → 5049.32] Hard work.
[5050.66 → 5051.70] Someone has to do.
[5053.88 → 5055.72] 3930k versus 3970x.
[5056.00 → 5056.72] You want to handle that?
[5056.72 → 5058.38] I would go 3930k.
[5058.66 → 5058.92] Yeah.
[5059.08 → 5060.66] Spend the money on anything else.
[5061.48 → 5061.96] Like,
[5062.32 → 5066.00] buy 500 pops.
[5066.34 → 5066.62] Like,
[5066.76 → 5070.64] unless you must have the bragging rights of the 3970x,
[5071.42 → 5072.52] then,
[5073.04 → 5073.60] um,
[5073.78 → 5074.18] Oh,
[5074.74 → 5075.66] that's kind of cool.
[5081.68 → 5082.24] Yeah.
[5085.34 → 5085.78] Oh,
[5085.78 → 5087.02] I know.
[5087.02 → 5087.92] I totally,
[5087.92 → 5091.52] I want to kill them all at the same time.
[5093.96 → 5094.32] Oh,
[5094.46 → 5095.52] you run away.
[5096.88 → 5098.02] That was so unfortunate.
[5098.80 → 5099.16] I know,
[5099.22 → 5100.22] where'd the third one go?
[5100.22 → 5100.54] I don't know.
[5101.20 → 5101.62] It's like,
[5101.72 → 5101.94] really?
[5102.10 → 5102.60] That little,
[5102.72 → 5103.52] that limited memory?
[5104.12 → 5104.66] He's like,
[5104.72 → 5104.92] nope,
[5105.12 → 5106.02] I'm out of here.
[5106.02 → 5109.38] Someone keeps asking what I think about graphing super capacitors.
[5109.52 → 5110.46] I'm not an engineer,
[5110.56 → 5111.06] you guys.
[5111.60 → 5112.52] They're probably cool.
[5112.60 → 5113.18] They sound cool.
[5113.38 → 5113.54] Like,
[5113.58 → 5114.52] people ask me about,
[5114.62 → 5114.86] like,
[5115.30 → 5117.46] what do you think about the future of quantum computing?
[5117.62 → 5118.20] And I'm just like,
[5118.20 → 5119.56] quantum computing is epic.
[5119.88 → 5120.18] Yeah,
[5120.38 → 5121.44] it can be epic all at once.
[5121.44 → 5122.52] In between zeros and ones?
[5123.22 → 5123.58] Okay.
[5123.78 → 5124.36] That's great.
[5125.32 → 5128.88] That doesn't mean that I'm some kind of software engineer that is going to make-
[5128.88 → 5130.32] Multi-processing on a single floor?
[5130.32 → 5131.58] People ask me things like,
[5131.76 → 5132.30] like,
[5132.36 → 5134.04] when do you think quantum computers are coming?
[5134.14 → 5134.50] I'm just like,
[5134.58 → 5135.90] I don't know.
[5136.06 → 5137.12] Always answer with Friday.
[5137.30 → 5137.94] Always Friday?
[5138.04 → 5138.58] Always Friday.
[5139.14 → 5140.40] Quantum computing is coming on Friday.
[5140.76 → 5143.90] The entire planet will be on quantum internet on Friday.
[5146.80 → 5148.46] We're moving to a new place on Friday.
[5149.82 → 5150.26] No,
[5150.32 → 5150.92] we aren't.
[5151.08 → 5151.24] Yeah,
[5151.24 → 5151.52] we are.
[5152.42 → 5153.06] We are.
[5153.62 → 5154.50] It's Friday today.
[5154.88 → 5155.10] Yeah.
[5156.04 → 5156.52] Next Friday.
[5157.88 → 5158.32] So,
[5158.42 → 5159.84] the answer is always next Friday?
[5159.84 → 5160.30] Always next Friday.
[5160.32 → 5170.50] Or you could say there's a 90% chance that it's next Friday.
[5170.70 → 5170.90] Yeah,
[5170.96 → 5171.78] if you're a weatherman.
[5172.80 → 5173.02] Yeah.
[5173.12 → 5176.88] Or you could say that there's a 90% chance that Slick's going to be real unhappy.
[5177.30 → 5177.70] Oh,
[5177.80 → 5178.24] no.
[5180.18 → 5181.36] That's not cool.
[5181.50 → 5182.24] It's your favourite song,
[5182.30 → 5182.44] right?
[5182.54 → 5183.76] That's really not cool.
[5185.84 → 5186.32] Oh,
[5187.20 → 5188.64] that's the least cool thing.
[5188.66 → 5189.54] You know what's hilarious?
[5189.54 → 5190.42] Is,
[5190.42 → 5191.08] um,
[5191.32 → 5192.04] Diesel was like,
[5192.12 → 5193.94] was listening to this song the other day.
[5194.60 → 5195.00] Uh,
[5195.16 → 5196.84] because he actively listens to it.
[5196.86 → 5197.90] Because he actually likes it.
[5198.28 → 5199.68] And I was just like,
[5199.84 → 5200.88] okay.
[5200.88 → 5202.44] And you know what?
[5202.44 → 5205.70] I actually find the beginning of it not that catchy.
[5205.70 → 5206.00] Like,
[5206.04 → 5206.90] I don't mind it.
[5207.52 → 5208.40] And I was like,
[5208.42 → 5208.70] okay,
[5208.86 → 5209.42] I'm going to see,
[5209.52 → 5209.86] I'm going to,
[5209.90 → 5210.62] I'm going to listen to it.
[5210.64 → 5212.00] Because I'd never listened to the whole song.
[5212.32 → 5212.62] So,
[5212.76 → 5213.58] like,
[5213.64 → 5215.00] this rap part comes on.
[5215.18 → 5215.54] And I was like,
[5215.60 → 5215.84] what?
[5216.34 → 5217.54] There's rap in this song?
[5217.88 → 5218.64] Does this go on or no?
[5219.00 → 5219.54] I don't know.
[5219.66 → 5219.86] It's okay.
[5219.86 → 5220.36] Um,
[5220.58 → 5225.74] so I realized that as many times as I've been linked to Friday as a troll or whatever else,
[5225.90 → 5230.24] I had never actually listened to the whole song ever.
[5230.24 → 5231.92] Um,
[5232.32 → 5235.58] and the rap is like two thirds of the way through or half of the way through or whatever.
[5235.72 → 5236.68] What are you doing?
[5236.78 → 5237.74] I don't know where I'm supposed to,
[5237.98 → 5238.32] oh.
[5238.66 → 5238.88] Jump.
[5239.20 → 5239.52] Okay.
[5239.94 → 5241.26] I wasn't sure where I was supposed to go.
[5241.46 → 5241.74] Yay!
[5242.12 → 5242.34] Okay,
[5242.56 → 5246.18] so this is the same as the one that you beat with the wizard guy,
[5246.52 → 5248.66] except that there are two fireballs.
[5249.30 → 5251.06] So you got to hit the right one out of the three.
[5251.24 → 5252.90] I don't entirely remember what you're talking about,
[5252.94 → 5253.22] but I'm sure,
[5253.24 → 5253.52] oh yeah,
[5253.64 → 5253.84] okay.
[5254.96 → 5255.26] I was like,
[5255.30 → 5256.48] I'm sure I'll get it when I see it.
[5256.48 → 5259.82] Linus,
[5259.90 → 5264.52] any way could you let me know if I broke my BIOS after updating it?
[5264.56 → 5266.00] It won't allow me to boot my hard drive,
[5266.08 → 5268.04] won't load Windows 7 from a CD.
[5268.46 → 5268.68] No,
[5268.74 → 5270.28] it won't be anything to do with a BIOS update.
[5270.38 → 5273.20] If you brick your computer during a BIOS update,
[5273.64 → 5274.06] then,
[5274.12 → 5274.54] um,
[5275.58 → 5276.80] like it doesn't post.
[5277.22 → 5277.46] So,
[5278.34 → 5282.92] your problems are deeper than just like your hard drive's not detected or whatever else.
[5283.40 → 5283.62] Nope.
[5283.92 → 5284.16] No!
[5285.60 → 5286.04] Law.
[5286.48 → 5286.66] Oh.
[5292.08 → 5292.64] Someone's like,
[5292.68 → 5293.38] I need an answer.
[5293.48 → 5294.78] New business PC for my mom.
[5294.84 → 5296.22] She wants an SSD solution,
[5296.50 → 5298.62] but also needs data security.
[5298.88 → 5299.12] I,
[5299.18 → 5299.70] I don't know,
[5299.76 → 5299.96] man.
[5300.62 → 5303.18] It depends what you mean by data security on an SSD solution.
[5303.18 → 5304.12] If you want AES encryption,
[5304.30 → 5305.18] you can do that with 840.
[5305.50 → 5305.74] Yeah,
[5305.86 → 5306.00] if you,
[5306.10 → 5306.38] AES,
[5306.42 → 5306.64] okay,
[5306.82 → 5307.00] there.
[5307.14 → 5308.08] If you just mean encryption,
[5308.26 → 5309.10] then 840.
[5310.06 → 5311.72] That's the only way I can properly interpret it.
[5311.72 → 5312.02] Uh,
[5312.02 → 5312.20] the
[5312.20 → 5313.08] the trick with,
[5313.08 → 5313.58] um,
[5313.64 → 5314.58] the trick with AES,
[5314.66 → 5314.86] though,
[5314.90 → 5315.62] a lot of the time,
[5315.62 → 5319.40] is that the motherboard has to support it.
[5319.80 → 5321.64] And a lot of motherboards.
[5321.64 → 5322.70] TPM module.
[5323.14 → 5323.28] Yeah.
[5323.28 → 5324.14] They'll support it,
[5324.18 → 5325.22] but they won't have the module.
[5325.32 → 5327.02] Where do you even buy a TPM module?
[5327.02 → 5327.32] I,
[5327.32 → 5327.56] actually,
[5327.76 → 5328.14] I don't know.
[5328.26 → 5328.80] Check it up online.
[5328.86 → 5329.60] There's probably somewhere.
[5329.60 → 5330.42] like,
[5330.42 → 5330.44] like,
[5330.44 → 5330.46] like,
[5330.46 → 5334.22] has anyone on the consumer side actually cared about this?
[5335.06 → 5335.88] I have no idea.
[5336.48 → 5336.64] Like,
[5336.70 → 5337.98] a lot of fuss gets made about,
[5338.12 → 5338.32] like,
[5338.36 → 5338.60] uh,
[5338.60 → 5339.24] I forget who it was.
[5339.28 → 5339.38] Yeah,
[5339.42 → 5340.64] it was Intel's 520.
[5341.12 → 5341.70] I think.
[5341.94 → 5342.16] Nope,
[5342.22 → 5342.36] nope,
[5342.36 → 5342.54] nope.
[5342.74 → 5343.14] Oh,
[5343.22 → 5343.76] shoot.
[5344.70 → 5345.78] It was Intel's 520,
[5345.84 → 5346.16] I think,
[5346.24 → 5349.04] where the AES wasn't working right or something.
[5349.16 → 5349.82] Someone's drive.
[5350.24 → 5350.74] And there was,
[5350.82 → 5350.90] like,
[5350.92 → 5351.90] a big hubbub about it.
[5351.94 → 5352.22] And I was like,
[5352.24 → 5353.62] has anyone actually used it?
[5355.02 → 5355.42] Nope.
[5355.42 → 5356.30] So,
[5356.38 → 5356.60] yeah.
[5356.84 → 5357.30] It's cool,
[5357.40 → 5358.80] but it doesn't get used that much.
[5360.32 → 5360.76] Yeah.
[5362.92 → 5364.80] I get such a kick out of people who,
[5364.90 → 5365.10] like,
[5365.64 → 5367.62] message me things or call me,
[5367.68 → 5370.00] because I hope they know that no matter what they say,
[5370.24 → 5373.30] I'm blocking every single one of them.
[5374.80 → 5375.98] And they can call me,
[5376.06 → 5376.20] like,
[5376.26 → 5377.80] I'm sure there are ones that,
[5377.80 → 5378.36] like,
[5379.74 → 5380.72] call me more.
[5381.56 → 5381.58] And,
[5381.68 → 5382.28] because it just kicks,
[5382.38 → 5383.64] it just kicks straight to voicemail,
[5383.72 → 5383.82] like,
[5383.82 → 5384.76] as if I didn't get the call.
[5384.96 → 5385.14] Oh,
[5385.20 → 5385.38] okay.
[5385.74 → 5386.86] Can they leave a voicemail,
[5386.94 → 5387.04] though?
[5388.04 → 5388.26] Uh,
[5388.28 → 5388.42] no.
[5389.36 → 5391.96] It just says the cellular customer is away from whatever.
[5392.14 → 5392.46] Oh,
[5392.66 → 5392.84] okay,
[5392.90 → 5393.04] yeah.
[5395.30 → 5395.78] What?
[5396.74 → 5397.88] I didn't see that.
[5399.84 → 5400.52] Someone asks,
[5400.62 → 5400.86] Linus,
[5400.90 → 5404.30] have you tried Crossfire with one of the new APU processors and a graphics card?
[5404.68 → 5406.14] I actually haven't.
[5408.08 → 5409.38] I have not done that,
[5409.56 → 5410.56] because it's dumb.
[5410.56 → 5415.98] just stop.
[5415.98 → 5419.14] Because it's dumb.
[5419.14 → 5420.96] No further explanation.
[5420.96 → 5426.86] because the right answer is run onboard video or don't run onboard video.
[5427.50 → 5431.36] The right answer is not run onboard video and another thing,
[5431.42 → 5436.96] unless you're talking lucid virtue, and you have a power savings that you're getting out of it.
[5436.96 → 5437.50] And that's it.
[5437.50 → 5439.26] And that's it.
[5439.26 → 5440.16] Or like,
[5440.24 → 5440.50] okay,
[5440.68 → 5440.90] okay,
[5440.90 → 5441.96] besides power savings,
[5441.96 → 5445.62] you could also have the benefit of being able to use your onboard graphics,
[5445.62 → 5446.80] like on an Intel platform,
[5446.80 → 5449.90] for video transcoding and using your dedicated graphics for gaming.
[5449.90 → 5451.10] But like,
[5451.10 → 5457.66] actually running games on a hybrid onboard dedicated solution is not,
[5457.66 → 5460.70] not actually the thing to do.
[5460.94 → 5463.14] So you don't really want to do that.
[5463.74 → 5465.82] Now you just screened all the people to tell you.
[5466.24 → 5466.58] Okay,
[5466.70 → 5467.50] I'll just block them all.
[5468.00 → 5468.60] And then that'll be that.
[5470.82 → 5472.16] It looks surprisingly well.
[5472.78 → 5474.36] I love that about Android.
[5475.06 → 5475.82] Just being able to block?
[5475.94 → 5476.18] Yeah.
[5476.18 → 5478.44] Because iOS doesn't have that functionality.
[5479.06 → 5480.56] Or at least it didn't when I was using it.
[5481.98 → 5483.88] But it's just like natively built into the OS.
[5483.98 → 5484.44] That's so cool.
[5490.54 → 5490.90] Okay.
[5491.06 → 5491.56] So I got to,
[5491.66 → 5494.24] it almost seems like if you go through quickly,
[5494.64 → 5496.22] it's time to kill you there.
[5496.72 → 5496.92] Yeah.
[5497.18 → 5499.12] So I think I'll be more careful this time.
[5499.96 → 5500.60] Someone asked,
[5500.70 → 5503.52] how were your 670 attempts when you water cooled it with the H220?
[5503.94 → 5504.74] They were excellent.
[5504.74 → 5507.74] Water cooled graphics cards always have excellent attempts.
[5507.90 → 5515.90] Because the problem with graphics cards and the reason they run so hot is not actually because they kick out so much heat.
[5516.38 → 5523.32] The problem is that the coolers on them have such a terrible form factor that is so not optimal.
[5523.32 → 5528.88] And there's nothing the graphics card companies can do about it unless you're like Asus, and you're like,
[5528.96 → 5529.08] okay,
[5529.16 → 5529.26] well,
[5529.30 → 5533.10] we're just going to do a direct CU triple slot cooler because,
[5533.10 → 5538.28] because we're Asus, and we're going to do a triple slot cooler because it performs better.
[5538.32 → 5539.18] And it does.
[5539.18 → 5540.70] But other than that,
[5540.76 → 5541.90] there's not a lot they can do.
[5542.02 → 5543.88] So the limitation is the form factors.
[5545.46 → 5547.80] So when you go and put water cooling on it,
[5547.86 → 5556.02] even the worst water cooling on a GPU is going to destroy any other kind of cooling solution you can put on it.
[5556.02 → 5558.64] Because you basically are just changing the form factor.
[5558.86 → 5559.02] Yeah.
[5559.08 → 5560.94] Because you're moving the heat dissipation away.
[5562.22 → 5563.56] Which is kind of awesome.
[5564.32 → 5564.72] Someone says,
[5564.80 → 5565.06] Linus,
[5565.10 → 5565.76] look at your feed.
[5565.94 → 5567.18] I'm playing here,
[5567.26 → 5567.56] man.
[5567.56 → 5573.08] Someone wants to know if I'm doing an unboxing of a graphene IBM CPU next Friday.
[5573.76 → 5574.20] You bet.
[5574.64 → 5575.42] That would be awesome.
[5575.60 → 5576.02] We should do that.
[5576.08 → 5576.20] No,
[5576.26 → 5576.92] someone said WAV.
[5577.04 → 5577.20] Sorry,
[5577.28 → 5577.40] WAV.
[5577.56 → 5577.76] Oh,
[5577.88 → 5578.12] okay.
[5578.52 → 5579.98] Someone said TPMs are about 15 bucks.
[5580.04 → 5580.72] I've seen that as well.
[5580.86 → 5581.08] Okay.
[5581.20 → 5582.18] I don't know where you buy them.
[5582.34 → 5583.94] Someone asks personal rig updates soon.
[5583.98 → 5584.34] You know what?
[5584.40 → 5586.06] I'm going to go pick up my window this weekend,
[5586.18 → 5586.38] I hope.
[5587.56 → 5588.86] The only thing I'm waiting on,
[5588.88 → 5589.46] my rig is done.
[5589.58 → 5590.74] I've been using it for weeks.
[5590.96 → 5595.98] The only thing I'm waiting on is my,
[5595.98 → 5597.96] my glass side panel window.
[5598.60 → 5600.10] And then I'm also,
[5600.42 → 5603.68] I need like something cool to cover the holes that are in my side panel.
[5603.90 → 5604.64] It's something decorative.
[5605.10 → 5606.44] And then it's actually done.
[5607.30 → 5607.48] Uh,
[5607.54 → 5607.90] no,
[5608.06 → 5610.42] we don't have any 1150 motherboards yet.
[5610.88 → 5612.04] We actually don't.
[5612.20 → 5613.48] I talked to JJ today though.
[5614.60 → 5615.00] Okay.
[5615.54 → 5616.34] Shipping today.
[5616.68 → 5617.12] Okay.
[5617.66 → 5618.86] We will have motherboards.
[5618.86 → 5619.62] They're freaking out,
[5619.70 → 5619.84] man.
[5619.92 → 5620.14] Yeah.
[5621.44 → 5622.64] Someone says happy birthday,
[5622.74 → 5622.96] Linus.
[5622.98 → 5624.32] My birthday is actually next Friday.
[5624.42 → 5625.12] Should I go this way?
[5625.30 → 5625.50] Yep.
[5625.98 → 5627.20] Sunken ghost ship.
[5627.32 → 5627.56] I know.
[5627.66 → 5628.18] It's a good thing.
[5629.76 → 5630.04] Oh,
[5630.16 → 5630.92] I'm still not a good thing.
[5630.94 → 5631.22] Linus,
[5631.22 → 5632.00] I'm getting a new monitor.
[5632.10 → 5633.84] Would you recommend one of those cheapo,
[5633.86 → 5634.22] uh,
[5634.22 → 5635.50] Korean overclocking monitors?
[5635.62 → 5635.76] Sure.
[5635.80 → 5636.06] Why not?
[5638.40 → 5639.64] It should be noted guys,
[5639.74 → 5641.88] that just because you can turn up the refresh rate of a monitor,
[5641.98 → 5643.82] doesn't mean you can turn up the pixel response times.
[5644.28 → 5648.44] So a lot of the people overclocking these monitors are disappointed because they discover
[5648.44 → 5651.80] that they have a high refresh rate,
[5652.14 → 5654.40] but actually it just looks like a blurry mess.
[5654.40 → 5656.82] And I think some people sort of,
[5657.20 → 5660.14] people don't want to talk about it because they want to feel perfect about their purchase.
[5660.46 → 5661.62] But some of these monitors,
[5661.78 → 5662.88] even when you overclock them,
[5662.92 → 5664.06] you're not having a good,
[5664.42 → 5664.82] Whoa.
[5664.86 → 5666.32] Super responsive experience.
[5666.74 → 5667.46] They go away.
[5667.46 → 5668.24] I'm having fun.
[5668.42 → 5670.14] That was really unfortunate timing.
[5671.42 → 5672.74] Are you having too much fun,
[5672.80 → 5673.04] B-Roll?
[5674.58 → 5675.38] How's the new setup?
[5675.48 → 5676.16] Is it going to be awesome?
[5676.78 → 5678.02] Is it going to be good for Computer?
[5678.42 → 5678.76] Oh,
[5679.16 → 5680.18] I'll be at the same time.
[5680.18 → 5681.80] Yeah,
[5682.00 → 5683.68] CES was not fun.
[5683.86 → 5684.80] The rear gear at the time.
[5684.88 → 5686.18] Were you going to get that camera?
[5686.64 → 5687.10] Which one?
[5687.28 → 5687.72] That one?
[5687.96 → 5688.36] The FS?
[5688.58 → 5689.98] Are we going to be using that that much?
[5690.04 → 5690.36] No.
[5691.02 → 5691.68] That's right.
[5691.78 → 5692.72] You guys are the B team.
[5692.92 → 5693.14] What?
[5693.48 → 5694.92] You guys are DSL Ring it.
[5696.22 → 5697.46] So that'll be me and Diesel.
[5697.72 → 5698.04] Sorry,
[5698.16 → 5698.40] bro.
[5699.08 → 5699.42] Yeah,
[5699.48 → 5700.08] I forgot about that.
[5700.12 → 5700.52] That's funny.
[5701.52 → 5702.04] Yeah.
[5702.04 → 5703.04] Oh,
[5705.28 → 5705.60] this is,
[5705.68 → 5706.12] I forgot.
[5706.26 → 5707.84] This is the only special level
[5707.84 → 5708.90] that you get Joshi in.
[5710.88 → 5711.28] Oh,
[5711.36 → 5711.56] yeah,
[5711.68 → 5713.24] I am fully powered up for this.
[5713.34 → 5714.28] I hate this level.
[5715.62 → 5717.14] Remember when games were so hard
[5717.14 → 5718.52] that you just like hated a level
[5718.52 → 5719.34] but you played it anyway?
[5719.50 → 5719.62] Yeah.
[5720.14 → 5721.20] I don't even remember what I died to.
[5721.64 → 5721.96] Nowadays,
[5722.18 → 5722.64] it's like
[5722.64 → 5724.14] totally easy.
[5726.76 → 5728.00] I haven't tried Dark Souls.
[5728.20 → 5728.38] Don't.
[5729.24 → 5730.28] Is it just ridiculous?
[5730.28 → 5731.98] If we do a Dark Souls livestream,
[5732.16 → 5733.26] that would actually be hilarious
[5733.26 → 5735.68] because we would just spend
[5735.68 → 5737.36] the entire time dying.
[5738.58 → 5738.78] Like,
[5739.18 → 5739.50] oh,
[5739.56 → 5740.42] it's nuts.
[5740.76 → 5741.36] Who said what?
[5742.24 → 5743.80] He said Demon's Souls is even worse.
[5743.80 → 5744.06] Oh.
[5746.48 → 5747.98] I hate this part.
[5748.60 → 5748.90] Yeah,
[5749.02 → 5750.54] I can't believe I just lost
[5750.54 → 5751.56] all of my power-ups.
[5751.66 → 5752.52] It's not that hard.
[5752.68 → 5753.00] It's just
[5753.00 → 5754.74] it's unpredictable.
[5755.08 → 5755.56] Yeah,
[5755.74 → 5756.04] and when they,
[5756.20 → 5756.46] see,
[5756.54 → 5757.62] they can appear on you
[5757.62 → 5758.62] which is the crazy part.
[5758.62 → 5759.24] And when you're swimming,
[5759.38 → 5760.22] it's kind of rubbish.
[5760.54 → 5760.78] Yeah.
[5763.66 → 5764.52] You've got sad.
[5764.58 → 5765.20] I'm going to do it.
[5765.30 → 5765.62] You didn't.
[5766.10 → 5767.40] I didn't know the mechanic.
[5770.24 → 5771.20] In my defence.
[5777.08 → 5777.44] Wait,
[5777.52 → 5778.20] please hold on.
[5779.06 → 5780.50] You can set it up for diesel.
[5782.88 → 5783.32] Whatever,
[5783.44 → 5783.52] I don't know.
[5784.48 → 5786.44] Maybe I should look at it.
[5788.58 → 5788.98] Yeah.
[5791.38 → 5791.82] Okay.
[5791.82 → 5797.82] Communist Russian spy is working for AMD. Apparently I'm exposed. Wow, I was not looking at all there.
[5797.82 → 5799.82] How did you not die?
[5799.82 → 5801.82] Because I'm a ninja, that's why.
[5804.82 → 5808.82] Okay, so then you go down this thing which is really confusing.
[5808.82 → 5811.82] Well, apparently Bill Gates is like the richest man ever again.
[5811.82 → 5813.82] Oh really? Microsoft's Doc went way up.
[5813.82 → 5814.82] Oh cool, okay.
[5814.82 → 5821.82] I like Bill Gates. I'm down for him to be the richest guy ever.
[5821.82 → 5822.82] Me too.
[5823.82 → 5825.82] Hold the money.
[5834.82 → 5838.82] Can someone please tell me when they start streaming? I haven't watched their livestreams in a while.
[5838.82 → 5848.82] We're not streaming right now. This is a recording from three weeks ago.
[5848.82 → 5853.82] Yeah. Wouldn't that be hilarious if we actually just recorded a livestream?
[5853.82 → 5857.82] Tried to guess people's questions and just like randomly answer things that people were...
[5857.82 → 5860.82] That would be amazing because we could actually probably guess a lot of them.
[5860.82 → 5861.82] Yep.
[5861.82 → 5863.82] It's like, oh you have a...
[5863.82 → 5867.82] I'm buying a 3570K and a Sabre 2. What graphics card should I get?
[5867.82 → 5868.82] Yeah.
[5869.82 → 5870.82] That would be a question.
[5873.82 → 5876.82] Linus, will the 4670K be a worthy upgrade from the 3570K?
[5877.82 → 5879.82] Fractal R4 and Corsair 500D.
[5880.82 → 5881.82] Yes.
[5884.82 → 5885.82] All the questions.
[5885.82 → 5887.82] Someone asks if we're going to finish Bowser's Castle tonight.
[5887.82 → 5888.82] That looks boss.
[5888.82 → 5889.82] I have no idea. Probably not.
[5889.82 → 5890.82] That looks super boss.
[5890.82 → 5891.82] Can I see?
[5891.82 → 5892.82] That's awesome.
[5892.82 → 5893.82] Wow, that looks boss.
[5893.82 → 5894.82] Holy cow.
[5894.82 → 5897.82] I love how this is like a $900 chunk of metal.
[5897.82 → 5899.82] It's heavy too, but it's great.
[5899.82 → 5900.82] Oh, it's really heavy.
[5900.82 → 5901.82] It's great.
[5901.82 → 5903.82] Oh wow, the top is so jelly.
[5903.82 → 5904.82] Nice and good.
[5904.82 → 5905.82] Yeah.
[5905.82 → 5906.82] You're up.
[5906.82 → 5907.82] Alright, I'm good.
[5907.82 → 5908.82] So guys, this is our new setup.
[5908.82 → 5911.82] So instead, I was talking about this on the livestream.
[5911.82 → 5913.82] So the ergonomics of this thing is terrible.
[5913.82 → 5914.82] See this?
[5914.82 → 5915.82] Tiny little screen that sits here.
[5915.82 → 5919.82] So when you mount it on your shoulder, that means your option,
[5919.82 → 5925.82] is to like, crank your head to the right and like, look at it like this.
[5925.82 → 5926.82] Which is ridiculous.
[5926.82 → 5932.82] So now, with the small HDAC7, you can mount that right in front of where the camera operator's
[5932.82 → 5933.82] going to be looking.
[5933.82 → 5936.82] We'll actually be able to tell what the focus is like.
[5936.82 → 5939.82] So it's just mounted with bolts to the camera.
[5939.82 → 5942.82] And it'll keep your hands a lot more free.
[5942.82 → 5944.82] Oh, that's way more comfortable.
[5944.82 → 5946.82] That was ridiculous before.
[5946.82 → 5947.82] And you can see so well.
[5947.82 → 5948.82] It balances.
[5948.82 → 5953.82] So there's a huge counterweight on the rig.
[5953.82 → 5954.82] So this was like a 900.
[5954.82 → 5956.82] This was $900, right Tirol?
[5956.82 → 5957.82] Yeah.
[5957.82 → 5959.82] For the stupid rig that's just like basically here.
[5959.82 → 5960.82] Look.
[5960.82 → 5961.82] It's two rods of metal.
[5961.82 → 5962.82] Here and here.
[5962.82 → 5965.82] Then it's like a shoulder pad.
[5965.82 → 5967.82] And then it's like a weight.
[5967.82 → 5968.82] This is actually stupid.
[5968.82 → 5970.82] Why couldn't we have built this?
[5970.82 → 5971.82] Did I buy this?
[5971.82 → 5972.82] Yeah.
[5972.82 → 5973.82] I would do.
[5973.82 → 5974.82] I would do that.
[5974.82 → 5980.82] Oh, what's cool about this one too is it has a remote control for the piece here, for
[5980.82 → 5984.82] the hand piece which normally sticks to the side of the camera.
[5984.82 → 5989.82] So now, because there's a mount there, it's much more ergonomic because normally you'd be
[5989.82 → 5992.82] holding your hand in like here, which is really uncomfortable.
[5992.82 → 5993.82] And instead it's here.
[5993.82 → 5996.82] So you just have like a big old screen in front of your face.
[5996.82 → 6001.82] And you can control your focus with the this is called the follow focus guys for those
[6001.82 → 6003.82] of you who haven't seen one before.
[6003.82 → 6005.82] So it changes the focus of the camera.
[6005.82 → 6007.82] Oh, is the screen not connected?
[6007.82 → 6008.82] Oh, it's okay.
[6008.82 → 6009.82] It doesn't really matter.
[6009.82 → 6012.82] I'm just kind of drinking around with it.
[6012.82 → 6014.82] I wonder if we should have sprung for the AMO LED screen.
[6014.82 → 6016.82] I think it doesn't really matter.
[6016.82 → 6018.82] I heard the LCD is more reliable.
[6018.82 → 6019.82] Have you?
[6019.82 → 6020.82] Yeah.
[6020.82 → 6021.82] More reliable in what way?
[6021.82 → 6024.82] The OLED screen is more reliable.
[6024.82 → 6025.82] Really?
[6025.82 → 6026.82] Yeah.
[6026.82 → 6028.82] Oh, that's interesting.
[6028.82 → 6029.82] Cool.
[6029.82 → 6031.82] This one is really determined.
[6031.82 → 6032.82] This is really heavy.
[6032.82 → 6033.82] Wow.
[6033.82 → 6034.82] I'm excited though.
[6034.82 → 6036.82] Not that worried about the weight.
[6036.82 → 6038.82] And if it's balanced, that will help a lot more.
[6038.82 → 6040.82] Balance weight is way better than no.
[6040.82 → 6041.82] Exactly.
[6041.82 → 6042.82] Can I add this to you?
[6042.82 → 6043.82] Thank you, sir.
[6043.82 → 6045.82] I have no idea where I'm going.
[6045.82 → 6046.82] There we go.
[6046.82 → 6048.82] Oh yeah, down there.
[6048.82 → 6049.82] Whoa, you're going to die.
[6049.82 → 6050.82] Way to go.
[6050.82 → 6051.82] Can I wait?
[6051.82 → 6052.82] Wait, wait.
[6052.82 → 6053.82] You want to try it?
[6053.82 → 6054.82] Yeah.
[6054.82 → 6061.82] I can't believe how expensive that was.
[6061.82 → 6064.82] I'll try it, but it's nice.
[6064.82 → 6065.82] Wow.
[6065.82 → 6067.82] How much better is that?
[6067.82 → 6068.82] Wow.
[6068.82 → 6070.82] Oh, I'm sorry.
[6070.82 → 6071.82] One, two.
[6071.82 → 6073.82] And then, one, two.
[6073.82 → 6075.82] You may explain it to me, but you're not the one.
[6075.82 → 6077.82] You have no choice.
[6077.82 → 6079.14] Yeah, you may explain it to me.
[6079.86 → 6080.26] I don't know.
[6080.26 → 6080.76] I don't know.
[6080.76 → 6080.88] I don't know.
[6080.88 → 6080.96] I don't know.
[6082.96 → 6083.94] Do you have a main tour?
[6085.12 → 6086.12] I don't feel it.
[6087.50 → 6088.34] It's just weird.
[6093.38 → 6094.02] I don't know.
[6094.32 → 6095.30] How does it kind of weigh?
[6095.36 → 6096.42] It doesn't even weigh on it.
[6096.68 → 6098.26] No, it doesn't feel that bad.
[6098.34 → 6099.08] It weighs a lot, I guess.
[6099.14 → 6100.12] But it's not difficult.
[6100.26 → 6102.46] It's still going to suck to carry around all day.
[6103.02 → 6103.92] It's a lot better.
[6104.20 → 6104.82] But, okay.
[6104.96 → 6107.62] The rig that we had for CPS was so much worse.
[6108.48 → 6109.48] That is true.
[6112.20 → 6113.46] Yeah, it was a lot worse.
[6116.98 → 6119.16] Because if you couldn't carry it, it's perfectly weighted.
[6121.86 → 6124.42] Someone says, Linus, we have the same birthday.
[6124.98 → 6127.20] Because I said that my birthday was next Friday.
[6128.70 → 6130.70] Sorry, my birthday isn't next Friday.
[6130.82 → 6133.40] The joke is, everything is next Friday.
[6136.12 → 6137.30] Your birthday is next Friday.
[6137.30 → 6137.72] What are you doing?
[6137.84 → 6141.96] Someone wants to know, Slick, are you going to be doing a Brine your own computer at PAX Prime?
[6142.10 → 6142.74] Yes, I am.
[6142.88 → 6143.20] Are you?
[6143.44 → 6143.66] Yep.
[6146.28 → 6147.70] Assuming you don't have to work, you're up.
[6148.96 → 6151.94] Oh, I don't even want to talk about that.
[6154.10 → 6154.46] Nope.
[6154.64 → 6155.74] That's a conversation for a different time.
[6155.74 → 6157.70] Someone wants to know when did we start streaming.
[6157.78 → 6159.46] We started streaming at 4pm Pacific.
[6161.36 → 6163.72] Someone wants to know how much longer the stream is going for.
[6163.78 → 6164.62] It's already 12 here.
[6164.70 → 6167.14] Well, you don't actually have to watch the whole thing.
[6167.56 → 6169.36] We're actually just playing Mario.
[6169.46 → 6172.98] Yeah, we're like actually just hanging out on a Friday night playing video games.
[6172.98 → 6176.40] It's actually okay if you don't watch it.
[6176.40 → 6176.74] Oh.
[6177.94 → 6178.42] Wow.
[6179.28 → 6180.84] I was trying pretty hard.
[6183.38 → 6183.74] Crap.
[6184.24 → 6187.28] Let's see how many people tune out now that we've informed them that they don't actually
[6187.28 → 6188.22] have to watch it.
[6189.68 → 6191.06] They're all like, oh, what?
[6191.06 → 6192.06] There's bats up there.
[6192.18 → 6192.48] Oh.
[6197.16 → 6197.56] Hmm.
[6197.78 → 6200.14] My badminton group has some messages on WhatsApp.
[6200.92 → 6202.16] I wouldn't mind playing some badminton.
[6203.36 → 6205.16] Someone says I'm being forced to watch.
[6206.02 → 6210.20] Someone says I have my ninth Steam game giveaway for going on the forums.
[6210.32 → 6210.92] That's awesome.
[6210.92 → 6212.66] That guy, his threads are cool.
[6213.08 → 6217.22] I like his threads because it's not like super awesome artists that are winning.
[6217.40 → 6219.00] It's just like, oh, I like that one.
[6219.62 → 6220.90] And they're usually terrible.
[6221.38 → 6222.40] Which is awesome.
[6223.86 → 6224.86] I know exactly.
[6225.12 → 6227.34] I don't know the guy's handle, but I'm terrible with names.
[6227.42 → 6229.04] I know the threads that he's talking about, though.
[6229.72 → 6231.00] Some of them have been hilarious.
[6231.80 → 6236.54] I think all the meme content is kind of like that.
[6236.70 → 6237.62] Where it's just like awful.
[6237.80 → 6240.16] The one that wins is just going to be stupid and terrible.
[6240.78 → 6241.72] There's no way around it.
[6244.32 → 6245.18] I'm not sure yet.
[6245.18 → 6245.46] Okay.
[6245.76 → 6246.40] So let's not.
[6246.64 → 6246.78] Yep.
[6246.78 → 6247.06] Okay.
[6251.06 → 6251.70] Oh, yeah.
[6252.16 → 6253.12] We've had a few.
[6254.16 → 6254.72] See if I can get him.
[6254.78 → 6255.02] Get him.
[6255.24 → 6256.04] Oh, nice try.
[6256.56 → 6257.34] I got him this time.
[6257.40 → 6257.92] I got him this time.
[6258.12 → 6258.48] Boom.
[6260.40 → 6260.80] Boom.
[6261.80 → 6262.24] Boom.
[6262.24 → 6266.96] I don't remember the secret exit on this one.
[6267.96 → 6268.68] I don't know.
[6270.26 → 6270.62] That's.
[6271.06 → 6271.60] Oh, man.
[6271.64 → 6272.98] That monitor is going to be amazing.
[6272.98 → 6278.44] like the counterweight is pretty cool but me actually being able to see anything
[6278.44 → 6282.04] I don't even film that much I'm excited
[6282.04 → 6288.78] I don't remember the secret on this level I remember getting really frustrated with it once
[6288.78 → 6293.54] not that long ago because I was trying to figure out what it was and I couldn't do it
[6293.54 → 6301.72] so apparently tiny tom Logan gave us a shout-out did he yeah that's cool yeah how did you do that
[6301.72 → 6306.70] apparently he likes our work does he yeah it was on his live stream someone told me about it but i
[6306.70 → 6313.62] I was like I forget where i was somewhere like it wasn't happening I wasn't able to tune in
[6313.62 → 6316.98] thanks tiny tom Logan yeah, thank you
[6316.98 → 6324.40] he was the first tech YouTuber that I actually saw a video of
[6324.40 → 6329.06] that's cool but I was the one who captured your heart
[6329.06 → 6336.10] you offered me a job okay yeah there's that that's a way of capturing a heart
[6336.10 → 6337.12] that matters a lot
[6337.12 → 6347.22] yeah okay I don't know I think I can get all the way to both ends
[6347.22 → 6356.90] I don't remember like uh I don't remember where the stupid two things I don't like stuff like this
[6356.90 → 6360.62] where you just have to memorize the whole thing yeah well you don't have to memorize this one but
[6360.62 → 6364.82] you I don't like the stuff where you have to go at their pace right
[6364.82 → 6371.82] that kind of drives me crazy one thing i I know I brought this up a lot the first Mario stream we had but Super Mario brothers new or whatever it's called new Super Mario brothers we there we go the first one that came up for we um that one the levels seem to be designed so that if you feel like just going absolutely insane and just sprinting through everything there is a path for you, it's just like you have to keep on it, and you have to be quick but there usually is a path
[6371.82 → 6397.96] someone asks if I would ever let a fan work for me
[6397.96 → 6404.12] yeah we have to have all so far
[6404.12 → 6406.60] except for b-roll have been watching videos
[6406.60 → 6410.54] oh yeah I guess the b-roll didn't watch any of the videos uh diesel did
[6410.54 → 6413.06] um
[6413.06 → 6416.76] flip did
[6416.76 → 6417.56] whoops
[6417.56 → 6419.30] did it go left
[6419.30 → 6422.40] I don't remember any no it didn't go left that was
[6422.40 → 6425.92] I was like oh well I wonder if there's anything back there
[6425.92 → 6427.92] I thought I had room
[6427.92 → 6429.92] I thought your controller forced you
[6429.92 → 6431.92] uh
[6431.92 → 6433.92] cute
[6433.92 → 6435.92] now I have to do that again
[6435.92 → 6437.92] I wonder if I got oh no we got to that
[6437.92 → 6438.72] perfect
[6438.72 → 6441.92] oh no you have to still have to do that stupid part again
[6441.92 → 6443.92] what a pain
[6443.92 → 6444.92] nope
[6444.92 → 6445.92] okay
[6445.92 → 6447.92] apparently slick's gonna speed run this
[6447.92 → 6451.92] someone says Linus you should show off your rig at the bring your own computer at pax
[6451.92 → 6453.92] you know what my rig won't be impressive by the standards there
[6453.92 → 6455.92] mine won't either
[6455.92 → 6457.92] yeah well yours especially won't yours isn't even as good as mine
[6457.92 → 6459.92] I'm going anyway I don't care
[6459.92 → 6463.92] someone asked how do you feel about the switch 810
[6463.92 → 6465.92] um I feel like
[6465.92 → 6467.92] what are you supposed to do there
[6467.92 → 6469.92] uh you're supposed to wait and go down
[6469.92 → 6471.92] when it's going down okay
[6471.92 → 6473.92] yeah
[6473.92 → 6475.92] it's a case
[6475.92 → 6477.92] switch it in
[6477.92 → 6479.92] yeah it's really plastique
[6479.92 → 6481.92] I mean it's
[6481.92 → 6483.92] we're both into full metal cases
[6483.92 → 6485.92] yeah
[6485.92 → 6487.92] like pretty into metal cases
[6487.92 → 6488.92] yeah
[6488.92 → 6489.92] it's way to go
[6489.92 → 6491.92] way to go
[6491.92 → 6493.92] I mean it's got great features
[6493.92 → 6495.92] yeah
[6495.92 → 6497.92] I've seen some really cool builds in them
[6497.92 → 6501.92] I hope we get some builds in the build blog of the week that aren't our force
[6501.92 → 6503.92] someone tells me to stop streaming
[6503.92 → 6505.92] because I'm wasting people's lives
[6505.92 → 6507.92] you're watching
[6507.92 → 6509.92] um
[6509.92 → 6511.92] he's going to stop watching in a few minutes
[6511.92 → 6512.92] oh okay
[6512.92 → 6513.92] but not right now
[6513.92 → 6514.92] just a few minutes more right now
[6514.92 → 6515.92] just a little bit more
[6515.92 → 6517.92] just a little more level
[6517.92 → 6518.92] I don't know
[6518.92 → 6521.92] I mean quite honestly I haven't made any
[6521.92 → 6525.92] I haven't made it any secret that I don't really get the whole game streaming thing
[6525.92 → 6527.92] um
[6527.92 → 6528.92] I don't know how to do it
[6528.92 → 6529.92] but we're also
[6529.92 → 6530.92] oh you did the same thing I did
[6530.92 → 6531.92] I did the same thing
[6531.92 → 6532.92] wow
[6532.92 → 6533.92] um
[6533.92 → 6534.92] we're also not really
[6534.92 → 6536.92] we're talking about other stuff the whole time
[6536.92 → 6537.92] I guess
[6537.92 → 6541.92] this is kind of just like a super drawn out after party
[6541.92 → 6543.92] but with something in the background
[6543.92 → 6544.92] a foreground?
[6544.92 → 6546.92] I guess we're in the background
[6546.92 → 6547.92] no we're in the foreground
[6547.92 → 6548.92] we're in the foreground
[6548.92 → 6549.92] but we're in like
[6549.92 → 6550.92] small corners
[6550.92 → 6551.92] he's doing something
[6551.92 → 6553.92] he's playing video games
[6553.92 → 6554.92] what? What's your problem?
[6554.92 → 6556.92] he's going to feed that threat
[6556.92 → 6557.92] I know right?
[6557.92 → 6559.92] there we go
[6559.92 → 6562.92] what's a perfect sound dampening and good-looking case?
[6562.92 → 6564.92] okay should we say it in unison?
[6564.92 → 6569.92] fractal design define r4
[6569.92 → 6571.92] you're going to die
[6571.92 → 6576.92] build one and then put it in build logs
[6576.92 → 6577.92] yeah exactly
[6577.92 → 6579.92] someone said line this is exhausted
[6579.92 → 6581.92] yes I am exhausted
[6581.92 → 6582.92] holy crap
[6582.92 → 6587.92] do you know how long it took me to do all the annotations for the build guide?
[6587.92 → 6589.92] dude I was up to like 630 last night or anything
[6589.92 → 6590.92] right okay
[6590.92 → 6591.92] wait
[6591.92 → 6592.92] yeah
[6592.92 → 6593.92] okay
[6593.92 → 6594.92] we both did that
[6594.92 → 6595.92] fine
[6595.92 → 6597.92] do you know how long it took me to do the annotations?
[6597.92 → 6600.92] probably a crazy long time because there's a ton
[6600.92 → 6606.92] chapter navigation and then basic navigation
[6606.92 → 6609.92] each arrow changed at the beginning of the chapters right?
[6609.92 → 6613.92] yeah so I had to find all those timestamps in a 42-minute video
[6613.92 → 6614.92] yeah no that's not cool
[6614.92 → 6615.92] yeah that's not cool
[6615.92 → 6616.92] it was ridiculous
[6616.92 → 6619.92] it took me like almost two hours
[6619.92 → 6620.92] yeah that's not cool
[6620.92 → 6621.92] to just put in annotations for that video
[6621.92 → 6626.92] I mean never mind all the time that it took to make the video
[6626.92 → 6627.92] oh god
[6627.92 → 6629.92] um
[6629.92 → 6630.92] diesel spent days on it
[6630.92 → 6631.92] no, no no
[6631.92 → 6632.92] go when it's up
[6632.92 → 6633.92] yeah go when it's going up
[6633.92 → 6635.92] diesel spent days on it
[6635.92 → 6638.92] uh b-roll and I spent a couple of days filming it
[6638.92 → 6640.92] it was like actually kind of brutal
[6640.92 → 6644.92] someone says Linus why you only answer questions in caps
[6644.92 → 6645.92] uh
[6645.92 → 6648.92] I'm not going to answer the question because he wrote all in caps
[6648.92 → 6649.92] just to prove a point
[6649.92 → 6650.92] cool
[6650.92 → 6653.92] go go go go go go go go
[6653.92 → 6654.92] nope
[6654.92 → 6655.92] there you go
[6655.92 → 6659.92] oh this is he's asked this like 18 times
[6659.92 → 6661.92] what do you think of Daft Punk's new album? I haven't listened to it
[6661.92 → 6664.92] I've heard one song I like it a lot I haven't listened to it in a while
[6664.92 → 6665.92] yeah
[6665.92 → 6670.92] someone asks if I'll be getting a new graphics card for my personal rig
[6670.92 → 6672.92] no I tried to
[6672.92 → 6678.92] given how few video games I play these days honestly this is all the gaming I do every week
[6678.92 → 6682.92] and I think that my GTX 590 can probably handle like
[6682.92 → 6683.92] word
[6683.92 → 6684.92] excel
[6684.92 → 6685.92] and SNES
[6685.92 → 6687.92] yeah and word
[6687.92 → 6689.92] and like chrome and Firefox
[6689.92 → 6692.92] mind you I open a lot of tabs in chrome and Firefox
[6692.92 → 6694.92] yeah but 590 is a lot
[6694.92 → 6696.92] even with graphics acceleration in 1000
[6696.92 → 6700.92] oh yeah does that really like do anything?
[6700.92 → 6701.92] yeah
[6701.92 → 6702.92] okay
[6702.92 → 6703.92] yeah
[6703.92 → 6704.92] 2
[6704.92 → 6705.92] it'll come more into play
[6705.92 → 6706.92] like bigger
[6706.92 → 6708.92] some of the same volume is too low
[6708.92 → 6709.92] yeah we know
[6709.92 → 6710.92] we're not changing this
[6710.92 → 6712.92] yeah we're not going to make any changes right now
[6712.92 → 6715.92] a lot of people have said that it's fine so
[6715.92 → 6716.92] yeah we're sorry
[6716.92 → 6717.92] I don't know
[6717.92 → 6718.92] it's
[6718.92 → 6719.92] WWW
[6719.92 → 6720.92] crap
[6720.92 → 6721.92] WWW
[6722.92 → 6723.92] WWW
[6723.92 → 6726.92] wow I'm just like I'm so actually I'm exhausted
[6726.92 → 6727.92] I am too
[6727.92 → 6729.92] i kinda want to beat this though I don't know why
[6729.92 → 6730.92] me too
[6730.92 → 6731.92] why do I care
[6731.92 → 6732.92] why do I care
[6732.92 → 6733.92] we both
[6733.92 → 6736.92] I was up till 630 you were up till at least 4
[6736.92 → 6740.92] yeah and today's been a long day so I got up at 8
[6740.92 → 6741.92] um
[6741.92 → 6743.92] we got a lot of people who were up to the house
[6743.92 → 6744.92] then packed up we went to
[6744.92 → 6747.92] oh what did we shoot for NCI tech tips today?
[6747.92 → 6749.92] we shot a couple thermal take things
[6749.92 → 6750.92] one thing we're not talking about
[6750.92 → 6751.92] yeah one
[6751.92 → 6752.92] well
[6752.92 → 6755.92] it's a NCI project
[6755.92 → 6756.92] yeah
[6756.92 → 6757.92] it's a NCI project
[6757.92 → 6758.92] don't worry about it
[6758.92 → 6759.92] uh oh okay
[6759.92 → 6761.92] I'm better at coaching this than I am at uh
[6761.92 → 6766.92] someone says get a Joshi and just skip this with the Joshi rings
[6766.92 → 6768.92] that's actually a very good point
[6768.92 → 6770.92] cause this is just stupid
[6770.92 → 6771.92] yeah
[6771.92 → 6772.92] someone asks
[6772.92 → 6773.92] if I die we should go back and do it
[6773.92 → 6776.92] someone wants to know what is a really loud and ugly case
[6776.92 → 6779.92] I'm actually kinda tempted to try and figure that out
[6779.92 → 6781.92] what's like the loudest ugliest case
[6781.92 → 6784.92] that there could possibly be
[6784.92 → 6786.92] you know what
[6786.92 → 6787.92] um
[6787.92 → 6789.92] I'm going to go with the bf85 from tech
[6789.92 → 6792.92] I can't remember what it's called but um
[6792.92 → 6793.92] it's not only
[6793.92 → 6795.92] not the processor but boozer
[6795.92 → 6797.92] I think it's called boozer
[6797.92 → 6799.92] I don't remember who made it
[6799.92 → 6801.92] do I go
[6801.92 → 6803.92] I don't remember who made it
[6803.92 → 6805.92] but it has this stupid ugly front
[6805.92 → 6807.92] and you mount the optical bay
[6807.92 → 6809.92] oh the GMC one
[6809.92 → 6810.92] maybe
[6810.92 → 6812.92] the GMC r4 I think actually
[6812.92 → 6813.92] is what that thing was called
[6813.92 → 6819.92] so it had liked it had like a weird like bulldozer blade in the front and the optical drive was mounted vertically
[6819.92 → 6820.92] yes
[6820.92 → 6821.92] I know the one
[6821.92 → 6822.92] that thing's ridiculous
[6822.92 → 6823.92] yeah it was just actually stupid
[6823.92 → 6826.92] right when 800d came out like way back
[6826.92 → 6828.92] I guess it's not way back but
[6828.92 → 6836.92] right when 800d came out one of my friends I posted 800d and I was like this is awesome because 800d did a lot of things that no one had really done yet right?
[6836.92 → 6837.92] right? Right
[6837.92 → 6840.92] so 800d came out and was like this is awesome this could change everything blah blah blah blah
[6840.92 → 6842.92] I was ranting on about how awesome it was
[6842.92 → 6846.92] he's like uh I like this case more and was completely serious, and he's talking about that one
[6846.92 → 6848.92] dude why do you keep not going
[6848.92 → 6849.92] I was thinking of this
[6849.92 → 6850.92] I was thinking of this
[6850.92 → 6851.92] we have to move it down
[6851.92 → 6854.92] yeah well that thing was ridiculous
[6854.92 → 6855.92] it's terrible
[6855.92 → 6856.92] i never even saw one in real life but I was just like
[6856.92 → 6857.92] I did
[6857.92 → 6858.92] what?
[6858.92 → 6862.92] it was ten times worse in real life, and it was like super plastique and cheap
[6862.92 → 6864.92] it's like you can just tell
[6864.92 → 6866.92] yeah it was brutal
[6866.92 → 6868.92] horrible
[6868.92 → 6869.92] um
[6869.92 → 6871.92] do I keep going? Do I keep going?
[6871.92 → 6872.92] yeah sure go for it
[6872.92 → 6873.92] there
[6873.92 → 6874.92] yeah
[6874.92 → 6886.92] you know what i would I think the df85 is my uh gets my pick because it's not only loud and like ugly, but it's actually just had some terrible design
[6886.92 → 6888.92] like the five and a quarter inch bays that you couldn't
[6888.92 → 6889.92] yeah yeah
[6889.92 → 6890.92] the five and a quarter
[6890.92 → 6891.92] you have to go through the tube
[6891.92 → 6901.92] the five and a quarter inch bays that you couldn't get to unless you opened like this stupid plastic clip that made no sense at all
[6901.92 → 6903.92] just like
[6903.92 → 6904.92] whoa
[6904.92 → 6906.92] yeah keep it yeah there you go
[6906.92 → 6910.92] I didn't realize that was a thing until I was part way across
[6910.92 → 6914.92] let's see if we can figure this out
[6914.92 → 6916.92] if I touch this does it go up
[6916.92 → 6917.92] yeah yeah
[6917.92 → 6918.92] keep going
[6918.92 → 6919.92] go fast
[6919.92 → 6920.92] yeah
[6920.92 → 6923.92] Pooh
[6923.92 → 6926.92] you can stand on this head
[6926.92 → 6931.92] huh good jump
[6931.92 → 6937.92] huh Google Glass has been rooted and hacked through Ubuntu
[6937.92 → 6939.92] sweet
[6939.92 → 6940.92] forum's down apparently
[6940.92 → 6941.92] yep
[6941.92 → 6945.92] guys there's a plan
[6945.92 → 6947.92] that's all we can really say
[6947.92 → 6948.92] because yeah
[6948.92 → 6951.92] it will be down for an hour
[6951.92 → 6952.92] yeah, and then it will be back
[6952.92 → 6953.92] and then it will be back
[6953.92 → 6955.92] I can pretty much guarantee that
[6955.92 → 6957.92] and there is a plan to fix this
[6957.92 → 6959.92] a good plan
[6959.92 → 6961.92] not a bad plan
[6961.92 → 6962.92] not a bad plan
[6962.92 → 6963.92] oh wow
[6963.92 → 6964.92] that was a bad plan
[6964.92 → 6966.92] wow you just beat a level
[6966.92 → 6967.92] what
[6967.92 → 6971.92] it's been a while since you've beat a level that we've both been trying to beat
[6971.92 → 6972.92] uh... have you?
[6972.92 → 6973.92] yeah
[6973.92 → 6974.92] I think I was doing it right
[6974.92 → 6976.92] I got a lot better since the first show
[6976.92 → 6978.92] wow
[6978.92 → 6982.92] i I think I'm actually just like not capable of this right now
[6982.92 → 6983.92] that's embarrassing
[6983.92 → 6984.92] I really want to beat Bowser
[6984.92 → 6989.92] but we can view next after party as the after party that we beat Bowser
[6989.92 → 6990.92] that's true
[6990.92 → 6991.92] I'm pretty tired too
[6991.92 → 6992.92] I would not be against
[6992.92 → 6993.92] okay
[6993.92 → 6994.92] we have been going for a long time
[6994.92 → 6995.92] how many hours is this stream at?
[6995.92 → 6996.92] I don't
[6996.92 → 6997.92] I have no idea
[6997.92 → 6999.92] I don't think we would be doing people a disservice by stopping
[6999.92 → 7000.92] we can let twitch chat vote
[7000.92 → 7001.92] there's still 1500 viewers
[7001.92 → 7002.92] that's pretty cool
[7002.92 → 7003.92] uh... go
[7003.92 → 7004.92] you have to go right
[7004.92 → 7005.92] you have to go right
[7005.92 → 7007.92] you have to go right
[7007.92 → 7008.92] you have to go right
[7008.92 → 7010.92] you have to go right
[7010.92 → 7011.92] you have to go right
[7011.92 → 7012.92] go right
[7012.92 → 7013.92] go right
[7013.92 → 7014.92] oh okay
[7014.92 → 7015.92] well
[7015.92 → 7016.92] you have to hit it first
[7016.92 → 7017.92] and then go right
[7017.92 → 7018.92] go
[7018.92 → 7019.92] go
[7019.92 → 7020.92] just stay
[7020.92 → 7021.92] go
[7021.92 → 7022.92] go more
[7022.92 → 7023.92] no, no
[7023.92 → 7024.92] no just go
[7024.92 → 7025.92] what?
[7025.92 → 7026.92] go
[7026.92 → 7027.92] go
[7027.92 → 7028.92] run
[7028.92 → 7029.92] run
[7029.92 → 7030.92] run
[7030.92 → 7031.92] run
[7031.92 → 7032.92] run
[7032.92 → 7033.92] run
[7033.92 → 7034.92] run
[7034.92 → 7035.92] run
[7035.92 → 7036.92] run
[7036.92 → 7037.92] run
[7037.92 → 7038.92] run
[7038.92 → 7039.92] run
[7039.92 → 7040.92] run
[7040.92 → 7041.92] run
[7041.92 → 7046.92] run
[7046.92 → 7047.92] run
[7047.92 → 7048.92] run
[7048.92 → 7049.92] run
[7049.92 → 7051.92] run
[7051.92 → 7053.92] run
[7053.92 → 7054.92] run
[7054.92 → 7055.92] run
[7055.92 → 7056.68] go
[7056.68 → 7057.92] run
[7057.92 → 7058.92] run
[7058.92 → 7060.92] Actually, that's kind of unacceptable.
[7066.92 → 7068.92] I was like, keep going!
[7068.92 → 7070.92] Someone says, keep going, your death entertains me.
[7070.92 → 7072.92] I didn't die.
[7072.92 → 7074.92] No, just, like, if we just die because...
[7074.92 → 7078.92] Oh, oh, oh, okay. Keep going with the stream.
[7078.92 → 7080.92] Yeah.
[7080.92 → 7082.92] I thought he was referencing my run.
[7082.92 → 7086.92] You know, like, older Mario games weren't even this cushy.
[7086.92 → 7092.92] Like, in an older Mario game, there's no way they're giving you a power-up right at the beginning of the level just because they figured you might need one.
[7094.92 → 7096.92] Very forgiving.
[7096.92 → 7098.92] That shell's gonna...
[7098.92 → 7100.92] Wow, that was a problem.
[7100.92 → 7102.92] I'm so happy with PC.
[7102.92 → 7104.92] Huh.
[7104.92 → 7106.92] I like this level.
[7106.92 → 7108.92] This level? Yeah.
[7108.92 → 7112.92] Why? I don't know. I don't have anything against it. How do you like it?
[7112.92 → 7115.92] Oh, someone in the Twitch chat was saying that they hated it.
[7116.92 → 7118.92] What was that?
[7118.92 → 7119.92] What?
[7119.92 → 7120.92] I don't know.
[7120.92 → 7124.92] Someone says, don't stop believing.
[7124.92 → 7126.92] Hold on to that feeling.
[7126.92 → 7127.92] That was...
[7127.92 → 7129.92] Hold on to that feeling.
[7129.92 → 7131.92] You don't want me to sing.
[7131.92 → 7132.92] Nope.
[7132.92 → 7134.92] Like, you actually don't.
[7134.92 → 7136.92] I'm not a good singer.
[7136.92 → 7138.92] Which I think you both knew already.
[7138.92 → 7139.92] Yep.
[7139.92 → 7144.92] Guys, B-Roll is still here. Tinkering with the camera gear.
[7144.92 → 7146.92] I have to take the phone and come home.
[7146.92 → 7147.92] Whoa.
[7147.92 → 7148.92] You have to take what home?
[7148.92 → 7149.92] I have to take the camera.
[7149.92 → 7150.92] Oh, okay.
[7150.92 → 7152.92] Oh, okay. Apparently he's tinkering with his camera gear now.
[7152.92 → 7153.92] Um...
[7153.92 → 7157.92] Oh, okay. Are you taking all your lenses and stuff?
[7157.92 → 7158.92] Uh...
[7158.92 → 7159.92] No, I don't need them.
[7159.92 → 7160.92] It's okay.
[7160.92 → 7161.92] You're not that.
[7161.92 → 7162.92] Yeah, I know, I know.
[7162.92 → 7163.92] I'm done.
[7163.92 → 7164.92] Yeah, take it, take it.
[7164.92 → 7165.92] Because you can always swap them.
[7165.92 → 7166.92] Oh, I don't even know how to do it.
[7166.92 → 7167.92] You just press select.
[7167.92 → 7168.92] Well, not now.
[7168.92 → 7169.92] Now.
[7169.92 → 7170.92] So if you want to swap it out, just press select and then swap it.
[7170.92 → 7171.92] What is this?
[7171.92 → 7172.92] Fantastic.
[7172.92 → 7173.92] Someone says we smell handsome.
[7173.92 → 7174.92] Actually, I smell terrible.
[7174.92 → 7175.92] I haven't had a shower in three days.
[7175.92 → 7176.92] Oh.
[7176.92 → 7177.92] Yeah, I feel awful.
[7177.92 → 7178.92] Oh, I did not think that was...
[7178.92 → 7179.92] Like, I actually feel disgusting.
[7179.92 → 7180.92] I feel awful.
[7180.92 → 7181.92] I feel awful.
[7181.92 → 7182.92] Oh, I did not think that was...
[7182.92 → 7183.92] Like, I actually feel disgusting.
[7183.92 → 7184.92] I feel awful.
[7184.92 → 7185.92] I feel awful.
[7185.92 → 7186.92] I feel awful.
[7186.92 → 7187.92] I feel awful.
[7187.92 → 7188.92] I feel awful.
[7188.92 → 7189.92] I feel awful.
[7189.92 → 7190.92] Oh, I did not think that was...
[7190.92 → 7193.92] Like, I actually feel disgusting.
[7193.92 → 7195.92] How do you manage to go?
[7195.92 → 7202.92] I, well, last night I wanted to, and then I was up till like whatever o'clock in the morning
[7202.92 → 7207.92] finishing the annotations for the build guide, and it's just like, okay, I can either shower
[7207.92 → 7208.92] or sleep.
[7208.92 → 7210.92] And those are the only options.
[7210.92 → 7212.92] Why would you have to go?
[7212.92 → 7214.92] Yeah, I had to sleep.
[7214.92 → 7217.92] Remember, today I had to be in front of the camera all day.
[7217.92 → 7219.92] Which is actually kind of draining.
[7219.92 → 7220.92] Yeah.
[7220.92 → 7223.92] And if my energy level is not good then I'm gonna sound like this.
[7223.92 → 7225.92] That was pro.
[7225.92 → 7230.92] Okay, you are officially better than me at Mario when we're both sleep surprised.
[7230.92 → 7235.92] Someone says it's okay Linus, I like musk.
[7235.92 → 7240.92] I used to actually be pretty good at most Mario games.
[7240.92 → 7242.92] I don't know why I was so bad at some...
[7242.92 → 7244.92] Yeah, like I...
[7244.92 → 7245.92] Oh, that's awful.
[7245.92 → 7248.92] It's like the worst experience I've ever had.
[7248.92 → 7249.92] I can't...
[7249.92 → 7250.92] I don't think I've...
[7250.92 → 7251.92] Oh no, I beat the first level here.
[7251.92 → 7252.92] Maybe the second one.
[7252.92 → 7253.92] No, you beat the second one.
[7253.92 → 7256.92] I'm not going to beat this without a power up to start.
[7256.92 → 7260.92] I can't see anything.
[7260.92 → 7261.92] Go away Skype!
[7261.92 → 7262.92] Go away Skype!
[7262.92 → 7263.92] Skype!
[7263.92 → 7264.92] Freaking Skype!
[7264.92 → 7265.92] Go away!
[7265.92 → 7267.92] It's like how long...
[7267.92 → 7270.92] You know what kills me about Skype?
[7270.92 → 7271.92] Okay?
[7271.92 → 7277.92] When someone messages you, and you click the message, and it doesn't open up the chat window.
[7277.92 → 7278.92] Come on!
[7278.92 → 7282.92] MSN has worked that way for like what decades?
[7282.92 → 7283.92] Wait, it doesn't open up the chat window.
[7283.92 → 7284.92] Yeah!
[7284.92 → 7285.92] Like if you click on it and then start typing immediately.
[7285.92 → 7286.92] Like there?
[7286.92 → 7287.92] Yeah.
[7287.92 → 7289.92] Like if you click on it, and then you just start typing.
[7289.92 → 7290.92] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[7290.92 → 7292.92] And then you just start typing.
[7292.92 → 7293.92] It searches for a contact.
[7293.92 → 7294.92] It's like no.
[7294.92 → 7305.92] I clicked that person's name in the bottom corner because I wanted to go look for some other random contact that that person signing in reminded me that I wanted to talk to that other person.
[7305.92 → 7306.92] That's what happened Skype.
[7306.92 → 7307.92] That's how it went down.
[7307.92 → 7308.92] No!
[7308.92 → 7309.92] I use groups for everything.
[7309.92 → 7310.92] Like absolutely everything.
[7310.92 → 7311.92] It's like ridiculous.
[7311.92 → 7312.92] So dumb.
[7312.92 → 7313.92] I don't know what's down here.
[7313.92 → 7314.92] Oh!
[7314.92 → 7315.92] Nice.
[7315.92 → 7316.92] Whoa!
[7316.92 → 7317.92] Whoa!
[7317.92 → 7318.92] You!
[7318.92 → 7319.92] Yes!
[7319.92 → 7320.92] Good job.
[7320.92 → 7321.92] Thank you.
[7321.92 → 7322.92] That was actually pretty pro if I do say so myself.
[7322.92 → 7323.92] Yeah.
[7323.92 → 7324.92] Maybe I'm recovering.
[7324.92 → 7325.92] I'm recovering.
[7325.92 → 7326.92] I'm recovering.
[7326.92 → 7327.92] Yeah.
[7327.92 → 7328.92] I'm recovering.
[7328.92 → 7329.92] I'm recovering.
[7329.92 → 7330.92] I'm recovering.
[7330.92 → 7331.92] I'm recovering.
[7331.92 → 7332.92] I'm recovering.
[7332.92 → 7333.92] I'm recovering.
[7333.92 → 7334.92] I'm recovering.
[7334.92 → 7335.92] I'm recovering.
[7335.92 → 7336.92] And you always gotta save Joshi.
[7336.92 → 7337.92] No you don't.
[7337.92 → 7338.92] You do!
[7338.92 → 7339.92] It's so optional.
[7339.92 → 7340.92] Like beyond optional.
[7340.92 → 7341.92] What just happened?
[7341.92 → 7342.92] There's someone knocking on the door.
[7342.92 → 7343.92] That sounded like Easel's dog.
[7343.92 → 7345.92] You want to grab the door?
[7345.92 → 7347.92] I'm busy playing video games.
[7347.92 → 7349.92] This is terribly important.
[7349.92 → 7353.92] Whoever it is told them to duck because when they come in the door they'll be visible on the screen.
[7353.92 → 7354.92] Duck!
[7354.92 → 7355.92] Duck.
[7355.92 → 7356.92] Who is it?
[7356.92 → 7357.92] Duck.
[7357.92 → 7358.92] You don't know.
[7358.92 → 7359.92] You don't know who it is?
[7359.92 → 7360.92] No.
[7360.92 → 7361.92] Yeah.
[7361.92 → 7362.92] Oh.
[7362.92 → 7363.92] Hey.
[7363.92 → 7364.92] Hey.
[7364.92 → 7365.92] Hey.
[7365.92 → 7366.92] You guys still on?
[7366.92 → 7367.92] Yeah we're still on.
[7367.92 → 7368.92] Good job.
[7368.92 → 7369.92] What do you mean good job?
[7369.92 → 7370.92] You told me not to abandon Joshi.
[7370.92 → 7371.92] No but you survived.
[7371.92 → 7372.92] And I abandoned Joshi.
[7372.92 → 7373.92] And you did a good job.
[7373.92 → 7374.92] He was dead no matter what.
[7374.92 → 7375.92] That.
[7375.92 → 7376.92] Oh.
[7376.92 → 7377.92] Oh.
[7377.92 → 7378.92] I need Joshi for this.
[7378.92 → 7379.92] Ha ha ha ha ha.
[7379.92 → 7380.92] Ha ha ha ha.
[7380.92 → 7381.92] Oh that was terrible.
[7381.92 → 7382.92] I was so close.
[7382.92 → 7383.92] I was so close to it.
[7383.92 → 7386.92] I started with nothing, and I was almost through the level with full power ups.
[7386.92 → 7387.92] And I'd be able to get the secret.
[7387.92 → 7388.92] It's all about Joshi.
[7388.92 → 7389.92] That was rubbish.
[7389.92 → 7390.92] It's all about Joshi.
[7390.92 → 7391.92] Oh crap.
[7391.92 → 7392.92] Oh crap.
[7392.92 → 7394.92] Oh, oh that was my worst.
[7394.92 → 7395.92] Okay.
[7395.92 → 7396.92] Okay.
[7396.92 → 7397.92] Well my performance sucks.
[7397.92 → 7398.92] So alright I'll uh see you later I guess.
[7398.92 → 7399.92] Yeah.
