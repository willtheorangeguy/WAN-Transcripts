[0.00 --> 7.86]  Welcome to the live stream everyone. We've got a bit of a different audio setup this time. Maybe
[7.86 --> 12.48]  I'll give you guys a quick tour of what's going on. I've also repositioned the camera and we're
[12.48 --> 17.32]  using a different camera and I know that we do things differently every week and a lot of you
[17.32 --> 21.78]  are probably thinking, Linus are you freaking insane? Why don't you just do the same thing
[21.78 --> 27.28]  every week so that you don't have these problems? To which I would reply, good idea. That is an
[27.28 --> 33.22]  excellent, most excellent suggestion and I should probably should probably get right on that. I have
[33.22 --> 38.44]  made one super awesome addition and that is that I'll be sitting up here with a laptop so that I
[38.44 --> 44.80]  can look at notes and I've created a bit of an agenda for myself which hopefully at some point
[44.80 --> 49.66]  I'll get around to actually sharing with Slick before we start so that he has the advantage of
[49.66 --> 53.38]  knowing what we're going to talk about as well but maybe it'll be more fun to just blindside him.
[53.38 --> 59.32]  So we're going to open up with some Twitter chat. Actually what we're going to open up with is me making sure that
[59.32 --> 69.82]  this is actually public. Oh look at that it didn't accept my my naming for my YouTube thing. I love that.
[69.82 --> 75.74]  That's my favorite thing. You know what when YouTube doesn't take, let's have a bit of a discussion on how
[75.74 --> 82.32]  YouTube just ignores the user's instructions on upload sometimes. Some of you might have noticed that one of my
[82.32 --> 105.32]  one of my Titan videos went up a little bit on the early side. It went up about 45 minutes early or something like that and it was my 1600P performance review and I stand by naming it 1600P even though that's not necessarily sort of what everyone calls it.
[105.32 --> 125.32]  So it's 2560 by 1600P. Which I've been informed by Diesel I should be calling 2.5K but whatever. Anyway the point is it's a greater than HD resolution test and I think it had something along the lines of 300 comments on it or something ridiculous like that before I realized what had happened and I pulled it down.
[125.32 --> 139.32]  So that was as a result of YouTube not for whatever reason gathering that I wanted to set that video to private. Which has happened a number of times in the past.
[139.32 --> 153.32]  So this I'm actually correcting, there we go, I'm correcting one of my videos right now which is announcing the live stream and it just completely ignored me when I put in a bunch of sort of interesting things that I wanted to say about it.
[153.32 --> 165.32]  What video this is and apparently there are zero viewers so I better check that I'm actually even live because that would be even more clever at this point in time.
[165.32 --> 177.32]  Let's check the twitch chat. Let's open firefox randomly. Turn up the mic gain slightly out of focus. Sound is dead. People are saying I am indeed live though.
[177.32 --> 193.32]  Okay sound is not half bad. Live but poor quality. Okay well all I can really do to fix the focus would be to sort of put something where my head is going to be.
[193.32 --> 203.32]  Because Slick is going to be joining me in a minute. I think he's just grabbing some food and bad focus. Yeah I know the focus. Okay you know what I'll try and fix the focus on my own.
[203.32 --> 210.32]  The audio is different this week. Actually you can probably barely hear me right now because, see this? Check it out.
[210.32 --> 217.32]  So we got ourselves. We got ourselves. Come on let's see if I can get that in focus. Let's see if I can get that blue. That blue.
[217.32 --> 233.32]  So we got ourselves a C-stand. There it is. C-stand. Got like a rugged base going on there. So we got a C-stand holding. A boom pole. And then we are using our shotgun mic.
[233.32 --> 240.32]  So while I am over here I might as well bump the ISO a little bit.
[240.32 --> 249.32]  See if we are fixing things any heat. That's probably a touch bright but whatever. Anyway so there is our mic that we usually position on the camera itself.
[249.32 --> 267.32]  So now that's not going to be positioned on the camera. So I'm going to see if I can get this focus just right. So that's behind me. That looks like the chair. That looks like. Why don't we go with the chair. So the craft is in focus. That looks like the chair. Okay. Yeah. There we go. Let's go with that.
[267.32 --> 277.32]  So let's go with that. Let's go off this off. And I'm going to hope that all of that is all good. People are saying they can't hear. No need to point where the camera doesn't go. Lighting much better.
[277.32 --> 296.92]  Okay. So hopefully that's a little bit better for you guys. It looks like the frame rate is going to chop a little bit. But we're still having trouble with the Blackmagic Intensity Pro card. I think it might be related to the AMD motherboard CPU combo that we swapped out for in our streaming rig. Sometimes in spite of PCI Express being a standard and therefore
[296.92 --> 326.90]  standardized. Someone says if you're going to talk about PS4 please keep it short. I actually was planning to keep that very very short. Neither Slick nor I are console guys. The most recently released console. Okay. I own an Xbox 360 and a PS3 to be clear. I do own them. The PS3 has been plugged in once and used once. And the Xbox 360 has been plugged in once and has been used once. So the most recent generation console that I've actually used is a PS2.
[326.92 --> 333.92]  And then the most recent generation console that I've actually used extensively that I own is actually a Super Nintendo. So yeah. There you go.
[333.92 --> 356.90]  What was I saying? Yeah. Right. So because PCI Express is a standard doesn't necessarily mean that everything works perfectly interoperably with everything else. There's actually a lot of testing that goes on particularly at the motherboard manufacturer level and the hardware manufacturer level as well. Although more on that in a moment. To make sure that components will actually work especially if you're going to have a
[356.90 --> 376.90]  more exotic components like RAID cards. High end NIC cards capture cards. Things like that. Where these are bandwidth intensive devices. But not something that your everyday average consumers actually going to be using. So. So. More on the testing. I actually had a really interesting conversation with JJ from ASUS.
[376.90 --> 389.90]  While we were at CES that I haven't briefed you guys on yet. And that was about the amount of testing that ASUS has to do on their motherboards. In order to have their customers have a satisfying experience. So.
[389.90 --> 407.90]  So. So. So. Okay. Are people complaining about the sound still? Okay. I will turn it up a touch. But I really. I really. Check. Check. I really didn't think it was that low. But it actually might be now that I'm looking at it. Okay. Hold on. Let me get that fixed.
[407.90 --> 423.08]  Alright. How are we doing now? Is that better you guys? Hopefully that's a little bit better. So that's. That's. That should be loud now.
[423.52 --> 431.20]  How's the echo though? I'm actually really curious because I don't know if you guys noticed. But I did actually put a bunch of random foam all over the walls and ceiling.
[431.20 --> 442.90]  in order to. To hopefully reduce the echo in here a little bit. And having the sound a little bit. Or having the microphone a little bit closer. It's actually right here. I'm touching it now.
[442.90 --> 458.58]  So that's where the microphone is now. I think that should help reduce the echo as well. And we're trying to gradually improve the production values of this operation overall. But it's. It's taking time. I don't know if you guys saw it. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I got distracted. So anyway. I'm a little bit.
[458.58 --> 469.12]  I'm a little bit. Sort of worried that our AMD platform we're running right now is not compatible with our capture cards. It just doesn't work quite right. They're very high bandwidth devices. Very finicky devices.
[469.60 --> 480.54]  And this brings me to Asus's conversation where they basically. JJ was kind of venting that a lot of the responsibility for this compatibility seems to fall on the motherboard guys.
[480.54 --> 510.54]  Even though.
[510.54 --> 523.78]  And they're going to completely redesign a PCB and chip and all the. All the engineering that goes into that. To make it compatible with. Even more than 80% of motherboards out there. So I think there might be an issue with that. I think we're going to have to change that platform.
[523.78 --> 540.04]  Probably going to move over to. This guy right here. So this is a very high end board from a few generations back. This is a P5. P7 P55 DE premium. So super super high end board. From a few generations ago.
[540.04 --> 555.26]  We didn't want to put it in the test bench just yet though. Because we have a really interesting video coming out. Where we're going to be comparing the 8350. The 3770. The 3930K. And an 875K. So a little bit of an older platform.
[555.38 --> 565.04]  To find out how much of a difference there is on the world's fastest single GPU card. So that is the GTX Titan. With all of these different platforms.
[565.04 --> 582.42]  Are people using an older system going to have an okay experience? What about people using newer systems of various kinds? So that's going to be kind of awesome. Someone's saying don't blame AMD. It works just fine. It might not be AMD's fault. I just said AMD platform. So it could be something to do with ASUS's implementation on that board.
[582.76 --> 593.64]  It could be something to do with Blackmagic being the ones who screwed something up. Or Avermedia. I don't know what the problem is. What I said is the cards aren't working on that particular AMD platform.
[593.64 --> 607.30]  In fact they weren't working. I said the same thing before. When. Oh mute your own screen. Hold on. Is it on? Oh you know what you guys get. It's because of the directionality of the shotgun mic. I have headphones right here. That I use to monitor.
[608.80 --> 617.28]  And you probably can't hear them now. I chucked them away a little bit. So it's probably because the directionality of the shotgun mic is so.
[617.28 --> 625.96]  It looks like you got. Okay. Okay. We'll talk about this after. Someone figures that I got paid to make Titan videos.
[626.68 --> 631.16]  Yeah. We'll definitely cover this. And that's totally not true and absolutely ridiculous.
[632.06 --> 634.06]  So hold on. Moving right along.
[635.82 --> 639.36]  Anyway. Directionality. Shotgun mic. Headphones. Problem.
[639.36 --> 646.62]  So Titan. Did I get paid? Adding that as a discussion topic. Since apparently people do want to talk about that.
[646.64 --> 650.66]  I also had a lot of questions about why I didn't compare Titan to 690.
[650.66 --> 656.24]  There's a lot of conspiracy theorists thinking that I don't want to compare Titan to 690.
[656.40 --> 663.50]  Actually I asked. I've asked Nvidia for a 690 probably a dozen times in the last six months.
[663.50 --> 676.90]  I didn't get one. Or I should say probably about 10 months now. I didn't get one because there was a mandatory briefing that you had to attend to get a GTX 690 when it launched.
[676.90 --> 687.82]  I missed that mandatory briefing because I was literally in an operating room where my wife was undergoing a cesarean section for the delivery of my baby.
[687.82 --> 695.98]  So I missed that briefing and since then they actually haven't. Like they don't really just randomly sample GPUs. You either get one at launch or you don't get one.
[696.20 --> 702.90]  So I asked several times again before Titan came out to get my hands on a 690 so that I could do comparative testing.
[703.28 --> 709.70]  Did not get one. So that is why I didn't test it. Not because anyone didn't want you to see the numbers or anything like that.
[709.86 --> 716.18]  I did do one video with a 690. I borrowed one. I had it for like two days and that was it.
[716.18 --> 724.42]  And then I had to return it. And that was so that I could do that video I did on triple GTX 670 or 660 Ti.
[724.64 --> 729.18]  Something like that. Versus 690 to see what was actually a better value.
[729.74 --> 735.06]  So let's do some Twitter questions for a little bit. I'm just going to find my thing here.
[736.06 --> 743.90]  Someone says 690 is more important than baby. No, no. It was definitely more important to do the whole baby thing.
[743.90 --> 747.72]  Alright. On to Twitter.
[748.62 --> 752.88]  Frank Sirianni says best NAS solution for $400 or less.
[753.24 --> 756.02]  Actually you have a lot of options for a NAS for $400 or less.
[756.08 --> 759.32]  You know what I'd probably do? Is I'd probably get my hands on an old...
[759.32 --> 761.90]  I mean, okay, for $400...
[761.90 --> 763.34]  Yeah, you can do a lot of different stuff.
[763.40 --> 768.28]  I would either go with something like a Synology, which is a very robust NAS solution.
[768.28 --> 770.90]  Actually, I think I have one over here. Yeah, here we go.
[770.90 --> 779.32]  So for that kind of coin, you can get yourself something like this disk station.
[779.90 --> 781.64]  It's a little more than $400, I think.
[781.78 --> 784.84]  But it's extremely robust. So the performance is outstanding.
[785.20 --> 787.90]  One of the things about cheap NASs is that a NAS...
[787.90 --> 790.28]  Or network attached storage, for those of you guys who don't know.
[790.58 --> 794.72]  But a NAS is often sort of priced according to how many drives it accepts...
[794.72 --> 797.00]  And what levels of rate it supports...
[797.00 --> 798.90]  And all of the features that it has.
[798.90 --> 802.80]  Although a lot of the time, especially cheaper NASs, those features don't necessarily work.
[803.22 --> 808.10]  And you can put as many drives as you want in it, but it's so slow that it's unbearable anyway.
[808.10 --> 810.68]  I remember there was a really popular D-Link NAS.
[810.80 --> 812.34]  This must have been 3-4 years ago.
[812.64 --> 813.60]  DNS-323.
[813.98 --> 818.68]  That one was super popular, but it could only do 15 to 25 megabytes per second.
[818.80 --> 819.94]  Actually, I think it was less than 25.
[820.12 --> 823.18]  Like 15 to 22 megabytes per second reads and writes.
[823.26 --> 825.90]  And I was like, okay, so it's got a gigabit port on it, but who cares?
[826.32 --> 830.00]  Because it can only do a fifth of what gigabit is actually capable of.
[830.22 --> 834.02]  So high-performance NASs, like this one, break away from that.
[834.02 --> 839.02]  Because they have the actual processing power on board to take advantage of the gigabit network connections they have.
[839.14 --> 846.26]  And they have very robust firmwares for things like torrenting directly to the NAS without even having a client installed on your PC.
[846.88 --> 856.52]  Things like, you know, rebuilding the array on the fly and just remote access and built-in web servers and all that kind of cool stuff.
[856.74 --> 863.46]  The other option you have for a budget like that is getting your hands on an older, you know, honestly, it doesn't have to be anything special.
[863.46 --> 869.74]  So like an old crappy computer, as long as it has quite a few PCI Express slots, buy some cheap SATA controller cards.
[870.12 --> 877.32]  And then run something like, just run some kind of like a Linux NAS operating system.
[877.32 --> 882.68]  Or even get your hands on a copy of Windows Home Server 2011 or 12 or whatever it is.
[883.08 --> 884.68]  And something like that's an option as well.
[884.68 --> 888.74]  Because you know when you have a PC, it's as customizable as you could possibly want.
[888.90 --> 891.48]  There are so many apps you can run on it.
[891.54 --> 894.58]  That is to say that apps are applications and no more, no less.
[895.22 --> 896.58]  And it gives you a lot of flexibility.
[897.06 --> 898.64]  And so people are asking where Slick is.
[898.68 --> 900.16]  And I'm sort of wondering the same thing.
[900.22 --> 902.38]  So I'm going to go holler and see if he's done eating.
[902.60 --> 907.96]  Because I've been entertaining the audience without him for a while here.
[907.96 --> 910.58]  So give me like one moment and I'll be back.
[910.58 --> 910.64]  Okay.
[910.64 --> 910.68]  Okay.
[937.96 --> 961.38]  So funny.
[961.38 --> 964.42]  Okay.
[964.92 --> 966.86]  I have located Slick.
[966.86 --> 974.60]  And for that one viewer who comments on every live stream that the show would be better without Slick, I'm sorry.
[974.70 --> 977.58]  He has not actually been taken off the show.
[977.72 --> 980.82]  He is very much still going to be joining us on the show.
[981.04 --> 983.78]  But you definitely do amuse me.
[984.18 --> 985.00]  Not him so much.
[985.06 --> 990.50]  But you definitely do amuse me with your weekly comment and suggestion that he should be kicked off.
[991.80 --> 992.56]  You know what?
[992.56 --> 996.60]  I haven't actually done enough looking into Chromebook Pixel to talk about it this week.
[997.06 --> 1000.16]  But there are some other things that we can talk about.
[1000.24 --> 1000.46]  You know what?
[1000.48 --> 1001.56]  I'm actually going to...
[1001.56 --> 1005.90]  Here, let me just mute my headphones there so that you guys definitely can't hear it anymore.
[1006.00 --> 1006.62]  Sorry about that.
[1007.46 --> 1008.12]  All right.
[1008.54 --> 1009.80]  No, Slick is showing up.
[1009.86 --> 1010.66]  Don't worry, you guys.
[1010.78 --> 1011.48]  He's coming.
[1011.62 --> 1012.54]  He's coming eventually.
[1013.70 --> 1017.44]  Hey, Linus, check out this eGPU solution running through Thunderbolt GTX 670.
[1017.60 --> 1018.22]  You know what?
[1019.50 --> 1020.18]  Okay, yeah.
[1020.18 --> 1022.76]  I don't need to check the link because I'm pretty familiar with it.
[1022.76 --> 1023.98]  So there's actually...
[1023.98 --> 1030.74]  We had a Magma Express Box 3T, which is more of an official Thunderbolt to PCI Express bridge solution.
[1030.90 --> 1034.44]  So you've got Thunderbolt and then a box that has PCI Express slots in it.
[1034.44 --> 1042.54]  But it should be mentioned that even though that didn't work because of the lack of official driver support from AMD and NVIDIA,
[1042.70 --> 1044.52]  there are DIY solutions.
[1044.64 --> 1051.30]  The only drawback is most of them are limited to, I think it's PCIe 4X Gen 1 or something like that.
[1051.82 --> 1053.86]  It might be PCIe 1X Gen 2 or something.
[1053.86 --> 1062.50]  Some low bandwidth solution that doesn't really affect performance that much on low end or mid range cards.
[1062.60 --> 1066.60]  But if you were to try to run a high end GPU off of it, it might become a bit of an issue.
[1068.54 --> 1070.42]  Okay, this is from about 10 minutes ago.
[1070.54 --> 1071.78]  Someone complaining about the audio.
[1071.94 --> 1074.52]  I think I fixed that already.
[1074.68 --> 1076.46]  So let's go and have a look at some of the new tweets.
[1077.00 --> 1078.50]  Now that we're doing Twitter Q&A,
[1078.50 --> 1082.36]  Have you heard about Google Fiber opening shop in Ontario?
[1082.58 --> 1092.40]  No, but I'm extremely disappointed to hear that because this will do nothing but cement the impression that Torontonians have
[1092.40 --> 1094.96]  that they do actually exist at the direct center of the universe.
[1095.46 --> 1098.12]  No, no, I'm just messing with you viewers from Toronto.
[1098.54 --> 1100.08]  Although I can't imagine there's that many.
[1100.16 --> 1101.60]  It's like 1230 at night there.
[1101.98 --> 1103.76]  But I know that's incredibly exciting.
[1103.76 --> 1112.16]  I mean, Google Fiber is one of the things that has me geeking out because it's not necessarily just about the gigabit up and down connection speeds,
[1112.30 --> 1117.76]  but about the latencies or lack thereof that Fiber will deliver,
[1118.70 --> 1123.38]  which enables technologies such as cloud gaming.
[1124.02 --> 1126.62]  And welcome, welcome.
[1126.88 --> 1128.70]  I'm glad you decided to show up.
[1128.96 --> 1130.80]  Google Fiber is looking for engineers in Ontario.
[1130.80 --> 1134.80]  Google Fiber is the same thing as well as you do.
[1134.80 --> 1136.80]  Yeah, that was actually a thing that you probably heard on the way in.
[1136.80 --> 1138.80]  Was that your one contribution for a live stream topic?
[1138.90 --> 1140.80]  No, I had the two...
[1140.80 --> 1142.80]  You're not in the frame of squeeze over.
[1142.80 --> 1144.80]  I had the two things that I brought up in that linked weekly.
[1144.80 --> 1145.80]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[1145.80 --> 1146.80]  Why don't we start with...
[1146.80 --> 1147.80]  Okay, you know what?
[1147.80 --> 1149.80]  I moved the camera.
[1149.80 --> 1153.80]  So now because you're sitting in front of me, you actually look like a giant.
[1153.80 --> 1155.14]  No, no, I'm just gonna move a little bit.
[1155.14 --> 1156.04]  Well, I could actually sit up and then...
[1156.04 --> 1157.54]  Well, then you'd look even more like a giant.
[1157.54 --> 1159.90]  We're just going to have to deal with giant slick tonight.
[1160.36 --> 1162.86]  So, yeah, don't worry too much about it.
[1163.56 --> 1166.16]  Okay, that awkward moment when the host is gone.
[1166.30 --> 1170.38]  I went up to go look for you, and I had some success.
[1171.82 --> 1173.96]  Is it bad to suddenly unplug your computer?
[1174.18 --> 1176.06]  Yes, but no, it won't short out your components.
[1176.26 --> 1178.78]  It's mostly bad from a software perspective,
[1179.22 --> 1181.70]  because the components, they get turned off.
[1181.82 --> 1185.40]  The power gets cut to them, regardless of whether you hold the button,
[1185.40 --> 1188.50]  hit the switch on the back of the power supply, or unplug it.
[1188.78 --> 1190.64]  It's the same thing to the components. They don't care.
[1191.12 --> 1194.58]  But if your drive was in the middle of moving,
[1194.82 --> 1198.38]  rearranging some critical file somewhere or something, then you're boned.
[1199.64 --> 1201.26]  It's like as if someone's running down a track,
[1201.34 --> 1203.38]  and you just randomly put a brick wall in front of them.
[1203.92 --> 1205.78]  It's probably just not good.
[1205.86 --> 1206.78]  Is boned a bad word?
[1210.56 --> 1211.32]  I guess?
[1211.76 --> 1213.40]  I don't know. Can I say that on the live stream?
[1213.40 --> 1215.40]  Well, I've never taken it that way,
[1215.52 --> 1218.02]  but I guess if you actually think about it, yes.
[1218.62 --> 1219.60]  Yeah, like it's pretty rude.
[1219.60 --> 1221.40]  But then no one really actually...
[1221.92 --> 1222.66]  Like it's mild.
[1222.86 --> 1224.10]  Like you can say that.
[1224.46 --> 1224.60]  Huh.
[1225.24 --> 1226.68]  Yeah, I guess boned is kind of a bad word.
[1227.64 --> 1229.54]  Does it bother you when people say racket and racket?
[1229.72 --> 1231.38]  Well, if they say racket and racket,
[1231.48 --> 1232.44]  I'll never know the difference.
[1232.74 --> 1234.72]  But if they type R-A-C-K-E-T,
[1234.86 --> 1236.20]  then they're probably from America.
[1237.72 --> 1239.88]  So, yeah, they spell it that way there.
[1239.88 --> 1243.36]  What do you think I should upgrade to?
[1243.46 --> 1245.40]  A 660 Ti, then get another later on?
[1245.52 --> 1247.50]  A 680, or wait and get a Titan?
[1248.28 --> 1249.64]  Out of those three options,
[1249.76 --> 1251.22]  I would go with 660 Ti,
[1251.40 --> 1252.78]  and then get another later on.
[1254.02 --> 1254.38]  Yeah.
[1254.60 --> 1255.86]  I mean, that's the best value.
[1256.36 --> 1257.34]  Although, I mean, you know,
[1257.60 --> 1259.46]  if you want to be like one of the cool kids
[1259.46 --> 1260.30]  and have a Titan,
[1260.44 --> 1261.92]  then you could get a Titan.
[1262.60 --> 1264.96]  But unless it's for bragging rights,
[1265.52 --> 1267.68]  I mean, let's be very clear about what Titan is.
[1267.78 --> 1269.66]  Titan is a $1,000 video card.
[1270.60 --> 1272.92]  I mean, it has some cool features and stuff, but...
[1273.54 --> 1275.64]  Like, it's the kind of thing where, yes,
[1275.70 --> 1279.74]  it delivers the best single GPU gaming experience out there,
[1279.74 --> 1281.42]  and if you get a couple of them,
[1282.14 --> 1287.24]  it delivers hands down the best gaming experience out there.
[1287.58 --> 1290.66]  But in terms of what's the point of buying something like this,
[1290.74 --> 1292.14]  I think you'd be just as well served
[1292.14 --> 1294.54]  buying it to use it as, like, an impressive belt buckle
[1294.54 --> 1296.68]  as putting it in your computer
[1296.68 --> 1299.02]  because it's all about bragging rights.
[1299.12 --> 1300.24]  It's not about price to performance.
[1300.24 --> 1301.80]  I see a lot of people talking about
[1301.80 --> 1304.06]  price to performance ratio of this card,
[1304.80 --> 1307.72]  and, I mean, maybe NVIDIA's dastardly scheme
[1307.72 --> 1309.48]  was to get people talking about
[1309.48 --> 1312.04]  what a good price to performance ratio 690 has.
[1312.60 --> 1314.86]  Yeah, or, like, their other cards in general.
[1314.98 --> 1316.70]  How many comments have you seen on that?
[1317.36 --> 1318.80]  Oh, 690, 690, yeah, yeah.
[1318.80 --> 1319.92]  Yeah, 690, 690, 690.
[1319.92 --> 1321.74]  Oh, this thing's no good compared to 690.
[1322.04 --> 1323.92]  I mean, remember when 690 launched?
[1323.98 --> 1324.76]  Everyone was outraged.
[1324.82 --> 1325.58]  It cost $1,000.
[1326.04 --> 1328.08]  Although something you and I were talking about earlier
[1328.08 --> 1329.94]  that Titan does have going for it
[1329.94 --> 1332.70]  is the frames created,
[1332.84 --> 1334.48]  like, the interval between frames created.
[1334.90 --> 1335.48]  Ah, yes.
[1335.48 --> 1341.40]  So frame times as opposed to frame rates.
[1341.70 --> 1342.42]  So, you know what?
[1342.46 --> 1344.72]  This is probably something that we'll either cover later
[1344.72 --> 1349.10]  on the live stream versus frame rates,
[1349.12 --> 1350.12]  or maybe next week.
[1350.50 --> 1351.90]  No, I don't want to restart right now.
[1352.00 --> 1352.66]  Stupid windows.
[1353.34 --> 1355.50]  Frame times versus frame rates.
[1355.56 --> 1356.42]  And what's the difference?
[1356.54 --> 1358.90]  And why are frame times actually, in some ways,
[1359.28 --> 1360.10]  more important?
[1360.10 --> 1362.48]  So a more consistent frame time
[1362.48 --> 1364.72]  is actually potentially more important
[1364.72 --> 1366.54]  than the overall frame rate.
[1368.36 --> 1371.28]  So let's move into our first real discussion topic
[1371.28 --> 1372.16]  since you've arrived.
[1372.78 --> 1375.52]  Titan, did I get paid to make Titan videos?
[1376.38 --> 1376.78]  No.
[1377.42 --> 1377.74]  Okay.
[1378.46 --> 1380.50]  What evidence do we have to support this theory?
[1380.50 --> 1385.00]  Um, we don't have any extra money.
[1385.60 --> 1386.12]  Well, okay.
[1386.26 --> 1387.18]  That's one thing.
[1388.54 --> 1390.42]  So I'd like to hear your theory as to why...
[1390.42 --> 1392.62]  We're still sitting in a garage without a heater on?
[1397.44 --> 1398.40]  Oh, I know what happened.
[1398.82 --> 1400.02]  You're trying to type stuff in.
[1400.08 --> 1401.02]  Yeah, I'm trying to type stuff.
[1401.14 --> 1401.70]  Sorry, sorry.
[1401.76 --> 1402.14]  We're back.
[1402.22 --> 1402.60]  We're back.
[1402.60 --> 1404.52]  Um, so yeah.
[1404.62 --> 1404.84]  Okay.
[1404.94 --> 1406.84]  So there's the fact that we don't have any extra money.
[1407.60 --> 1411.32]  Um, a previous launch of this graphics card
[1411.32 --> 1413.04]  that you're typing in that they can't see.
[1413.54 --> 1415.22]  We released a ton of videos for as well.
[1416.04 --> 1417.26]  Yes, yes, we did.
[1417.42 --> 1419.78]  So I get accused all the time.
[1419.84 --> 1421.48]  And actually, it's gotten to the point
[1421.48 --> 1423.14]  where it's not actually that funny anymore.
[1423.38 --> 1425.30]  But I get accused all the time
[1425.30 --> 1427.64]  of being some kind of NVIDIA...
[1427.64 --> 1428.64]  Yeah, leave this page.
[1429.42 --> 1430.80]  Uh, fanboy or shell
[1430.80 --> 1433.62]  or whatever else you guys want to sort of call it.
[1434.00 --> 1435.82]  Um, but let's go ahead
[1435.82 --> 1438.88]  and look at the street facts.
[1439.22 --> 1441.12]  This is my launch coverage
[1441.12 --> 1445.10]  for the Radeon HD 6870.
[1445.24 --> 1447.38]  This was a big, important launch for AMD.
[1447.98 --> 1449.10]  And one of the things
[1449.10 --> 1450.64]  that was a little bit different about it
[1450.64 --> 1451.86]  than other AMD launches
[1451.86 --> 1454.68]  is I got a card before launch.
[1455.02 --> 1456.54]  So I had time to prepare
[1456.54 --> 1457.92]  a whole bunch of content.
[1457.92 --> 1460.76]  So the advantage of having a card before launch
[1460.76 --> 1463.34]  is that I can release my videos
[1463.34 --> 1464.92]  at the time of the launch
[1464.92 --> 1466.06]  when it's actually relevant.
[1466.56 --> 1467.88]  If I get a card a week
[1467.88 --> 1469.20]  or two weeks after launch
[1469.20 --> 1470.58]  like I did with 7970,
[1470.76 --> 1471.50]  what am I going to do?
[1471.54 --> 1472.82]  Release 10 videos about it
[1472.82 --> 1474.44]  when no one cares anymore
[1474.44 --> 1475.46]  and everyone who cares
[1475.46 --> 1476.54]  has already read a review
[1476.54 --> 1477.52]  or already watched
[1477.52 --> 1478.94]  someone else's unboxing
[1478.94 --> 1480.16]  or someone else's whatever thing.
[1480.16 --> 1482.40]  So that's the reality of it.
[1483.54 --> 1484.96]  You know, could you consider
[1484.96 --> 1487.14]  something like a GTX 690
[1487.14 --> 1488.38]  or a Titan or whatever?
[1488.60 --> 1489.94]  Could you consider that getting paid?
[1490.00 --> 1490.84]  Yeah, we keep the card.
[1491.22 --> 1492.36]  I mean, this card, this Titan
[1492.36 --> 1493.84]  is not going anywhere.
[1494.16 --> 1495.88]  It stays in our stable of cards
[1495.88 --> 1497.54]  that we are going to be able to
[1497.54 --> 1499.06]  continue to benchmark
[1499.06 --> 1500.20]  against future cards.
[1500.40 --> 1501.36]  Could you consider that
[1501.36 --> 1502.14]  a payment of sorts?
[1502.48 --> 1503.12]  I guess.
[1503.68 --> 1504.32]  But if you were...
[1504.32 --> 1505.16]  Considering we don't get to use it
[1505.16 --> 1506.64]  because it has to sit and wait
[1506.64 --> 1507.86]  for more benchmarks to be ran.
[1507.98 --> 1508.94]  Yeah, it's not like we get
[1508.94 --> 1509.88]  to like sell it.
[1510.30 --> 1511.42]  So, I mean, and here,
[1511.52 --> 1512.38]  if we actually factor,
[1512.46 --> 1513.68]  how many man hours do you think
[1513.68 --> 1515.22]  you and I put into the Titan content?
[1516.08 --> 1517.28]  I almost don't even want to...
[1517.28 --> 1518.16]  Okay, so we sat down...
[1518.80 --> 1519.80]  You're a little close to the mic.
[1520.02 --> 1520.58]  Right there's good.
[1520.90 --> 1521.70]  Actually, if you want to
[1521.70 --> 1522.52]  scooch back a little bit.
[1522.88 --> 1523.26]  There you go.
[1523.74 --> 1525.10]  We sat down before
[1525.10 --> 1526.62]  Titan was released
[1526.62 --> 1527.92]  and planned the videos
[1527.92 --> 1528.62]  that were going to come out
[1528.62 --> 1529.72]  and the previous live stream
[1529.72 --> 1530.04]  we were like,
[1530.10 --> 1531.28]  yeah, it's coming on Saturday.
[1531.92 --> 1533.16]  Didn't come until Monday.
[1533.52 --> 1534.26]  So we had like
[1534.26 --> 1535.70]  what videos we wanted to release
[1535.70 --> 1537.88]  and just kind of like
[1537.88 --> 1539.48]  grinned.
[1540.52 --> 1542.14]  Just was like,
[1542.48 --> 1542.82]  Yay!
[1543.38 --> 1545.14]  Okay, we have like
[1545.14 --> 1546.48]  two days to get
[1546.48 --> 1547.82]  all of this done.
[1547.94 --> 1549.22]  So between the two of us,
[1549.24 --> 1549.92]  I think we pulled
[1549.92 --> 1551.04]  three all-nighters.
[1552.66 --> 1553.68]  Because you pulled two
[1553.68 --> 1554.38]  and I did one.
[1555.04 --> 1556.04]  Okay, so...
[1556.78 --> 1557.04]  That whole...
[1557.86 --> 1558.44]  This whole week
[1558.44 --> 1558.98]  is just kind of
[1558.98 --> 1560.04]  one gigantic blob
[1560.66 --> 1561.00]  of not really...
[1561.00 --> 1561.88]  Is it safe to say
[1561.88 --> 1562.84]  between the two of us
[1562.84 --> 1564.44]  it was probably a good 60 hours
[1564.44 --> 1566.32]  just to get Titan out there?
[1567.46 --> 1568.46]  I think...
[1568.46 --> 1569.90]  I almost pulled 60 hours.
[1570.16 --> 1571.06]  Okay, so...
[1571.06 --> 1572.20]  Let's say it was a lot more
[1572.20 --> 1573.04]  than 60 hours.
[1573.54 --> 1574.78]  So if you went,
[1574.86 --> 1575.74]  okay, yeah, well,
[1575.82 --> 1576.84]  NVIDIA's paying off
[1576.84 --> 1577.58]  Linus to release
[1577.58 --> 1578.06]  a bunch of videos
[1578.06 --> 1578.52]  about the Titan.
[1579.14 --> 1579.90]  Riddle me this.
[1580.18 --> 1581.52]  Would I not be better off
[1581.52 --> 1582.86]  then to just go
[1582.86 --> 1584.24]  flip burgers on weekends
[1584.24 --> 1585.34]  and buy myself
[1585.34 --> 1586.34]  a Titan for $1,000?
[1586.86 --> 1587.76]  We would have made
[1587.76 --> 1588.74]  more money doing that
[1588.74 --> 1589.24]  than we did
[1589.24 --> 1589.98]  from what we made
[1589.98 --> 1591.06]  from the Titan release.
[1591.06 --> 1592.06]  So we're bringing
[1592.06 --> 1592.78]  Titan content
[1592.78 --> 1594.00]  because Titan is important.
[1594.20 --> 1595.26]  Titan is topical.
[1595.38 --> 1595.98]  It is the world's
[1595.98 --> 1597.24]  fastest single GPU card.
[1597.62 --> 1598.84]  And if you actually
[1598.84 --> 1599.34]  go back
[1599.34 --> 1600.78]  and actually look historically
[1600.78 --> 1602.64]  at an AMD graphics card
[1602.64 --> 1604.18]  that I actually got access
[1604.18 --> 1605.14]  to before launch,
[1605.50 --> 1606.96]  here is my full tour
[1606.96 --> 1609.60]  of the triple TV setup
[1609.60 --> 1610.36]  that I did for that
[1610.36 --> 1611.66]  which took freaking forever
[1611.66 --> 1612.80]  to coordinate, by the way.
[1613.16 --> 1614.62]  Here is my performance review.
[1615.08 --> 1616.38]  Here is my noise
[1616.38 --> 1617.44]  and temperature testing.
[1617.90 --> 1619.12]  Here is my power consumption.
[1619.12 --> 1621.10]  Here is showing off a game
[1621.10 --> 1622.88]  on three 46-inch TVs.
[1623.34 --> 1624.08]  Here's another game
[1624.08 --> 1625.36]  with 46-inch TVs.
[1625.92 --> 1626.80]  Here's an unboxing.
[1627.32 --> 1628.64]  Here's an installation guide.
[1628.90 --> 1629.68]  Here's a sneak peek
[1629.68 --> 1630.22]  at the setup.
[1630.70 --> 1631.70]  Here's the bear card
[1631.70 --> 1632.52]  heatsink removal.
[1632.88 --> 1634.06]  Here's the length comparison.
[1634.48 --> 1635.80]  Here's another game with it.
[1636.78 --> 1638.70]  So hopefully I've made my point.
[1639.14 --> 1640.70]  If I get access to the card
[1640.70 --> 1641.78]  in a timely fashion
[1641.78 --> 1643.26]  that allows me to actually
[1643.26 --> 1644.62]  bring the content to you guys
[1644.62 --> 1645.52]  on launch day,
[1645.96 --> 1647.36]  yeah, I'm going to do
[1647.36 --> 1648.42]  everything I can
[1648.42 --> 1649.42]  to bring you guys
[1649.42 --> 1650.34]  the best content
[1650.34 --> 1651.34]  I can on launch day.
[1651.64 --> 1652.66]  Did I get a big check
[1652.66 --> 1653.26]  from NVIDIA?
[1653.42 --> 1653.66]  No.
[1653.90 --> 1654.62]  Did I get a check
[1654.62 --> 1655.92]  from AMD for doing that?
[1656.30 --> 1657.12]  Absolutely not.
[1657.54 --> 1658.68]  That is not to say
[1658.68 --> 1659.56]  that we're not going
[1659.56 --> 1660.62]  to have sponsored content
[1660.62 --> 1661.84]  at some point in the future,
[1662.02 --> 1663.40]  but we're not going
[1663.40 --> 1664.62]  to have sponsored content
[1664.62 --> 1665.40]  on things where
[1665.40 --> 1666.40]  we have to be objective.
[1666.64 --> 1667.52]  So something like
[1667.52 --> 1668.44]  a video card review,
[1668.78 --> 1669.64]  it's never going to be
[1669.64 --> 1670.64]  sponsored by NVIDIA
[1670.64 --> 1671.68]  or sponsored by EVGA
[1671.68 --> 1672.46]  because that's ridiculous.
[1672.70 --> 1674.02]  The Crysis 3 video
[1674.02 --> 1674.62]  is released, right?
[1675.36 --> 1676.36]  No, that's not released yet.
[1676.36 --> 1677.22]  Did you redo the voiceover?
[1678.14 --> 1678.38]  Nope.
[1678.52 --> 1679.04]  Well, that's why
[1679.04 --> 1679.82]  it's not released yet.
[1680.02 --> 1680.96]  Can I talk about it?
[1681.00 --> 1681.78]  Sure, yeah, go for it.
[1681.92 --> 1682.88]  Okay, so we have
[1682.88 --> 1683.58]  a sponsored video
[1683.58 --> 1684.14]  being released
[1684.14 --> 1684.74]  on the channel.
[1685.34 --> 1685.58]  Soon.
[1685.58 --> 1685.90]  Soon.
[1686.74 --> 1687.62]  It is not...
[1687.62 --> 1688.20]  Probably tonight.
[1689.28 --> 1689.88]  Can we do it tonight
[1689.88 --> 1690.14]  or no?
[1690.50 --> 1691.18]  Probably, yeah.
[1691.28 --> 1691.50]  Okay.
[1691.50 --> 1693.08]  It has nothing to do
[1693.08 --> 1694.00]  with the actual benchmarks
[1694.00 --> 1694.72]  of the card.
[1694.88 --> 1696.56]  It's actually...
[1696.56 --> 1698.00]  If you've seen the previous ones,
[1698.10 --> 1700.30]  Far Cry 3 and StarCraft.
[1700.52 --> 1700.80]  Two.
[1701.10 --> 1701.62]  StarCraft 2.
[1701.74 --> 1702.70]  We could do a benchmarking
[1702.70 --> 1703.64]  guide for StarCraft 1.
[1703.88 --> 1704.56]  We should.
[1704.94 --> 1705.40]  That would be awesome.
[1705.40 --> 1706.16]  That would be fantastic.
[1706.64 --> 1707.18]  April Fool's.
[1707.74 --> 1708.52]  It's coming up.
[1708.88 --> 1709.64]  It is, yeah.
[1709.80 --> 1709.98]  Sort of.
[1709.98 --> 1711.94]  So it doesn't have
[1711.94 --> 1715.78]  the card comparison
[1715.78 --> 1716.36]  that we do
[1716.36 --> 1717.40]  for those games yet.
[1717.46 --> 1718.32]  That's coming later.
[1718.32 --> 1719.60]  But it does have
[1719.60 --> 1722.02]  our Crysis 3 walkthrough.
[1722.52 --> 1723.18]  And it's just like
[1723.18 --> 1724.24]  EVGA sponsored
[1724.24 --> 1725.32]  and then us doing
[1725.32 --> 1726.52]  our Crysis 3 walkthrough.
[1726.62 --> 1727.38]  That's all it is.
[1727.48 --> 1728.22]  It's not actually
[1728.22 --> 1729.44]  a comparison
[1729.44 --> 1730.44]  or what we think
[1730.44 --> 1731.06]  about anything
[1731.06 --> 1731.80]  or anything like that
[1731.80 --> 1732.88]  other than Crysis,
[1733.38 --> 1735.28]  which isn't applicable
[1735.28 --> 1736.06]  and doesn't matter.
[1736.76 --> 1736.92]  Yep.
[1737.10 --> 1737.62]  And I mean,
[1737.74 --> 1738.68]  we're comfortable
[1738.68 --> 1740.06]  taking sponsorships
[1740.06 --> 1741.42]  on things like
[1741.42 --> 1743.00]  where we would have been
[1743.00 --> 1743.96]  using the product anyway.
[1744.40 --> 1745.22]  So for example,
[1745.22 --> 1746.08]  if we're comparing
[1746.08 --> 1747.06]  an AMD and an NVIDIA
[1747.06 --> 1747.80]  graphics card,
[1747.80 --> 1748.68]  I have no problem
[1748.68 --> 1749.78]  having an Intel
[1749.78 --> 1751.34]  sponsored spot
[1751.34 --> 1752.76]  because we can just say,
[1752.90 --> 1753.74]  look, we're using Intel
[1753.74 --> 1754.90]  for our test platform,
[1755.10 --> 1755.90]  which we were going
[1755.90 --> 1756.60]  to do anyway
[1756.60 --> 1758.76]  because it's the ideal test platform.
[1758.86 --> 1759.30]  However,
[1760.38 --> 1761.08]  really interesting.
[1761.22 --> 1761.42]  We'll talk,
[1761.50 --> 1762.86]  I have this on my topics list.
[1763.20 --> 1764.54]  Crysis 3 seems to perform
[1764.54 --> 1765.68]  better on AMD CPUs
[1765.68 --> 1766.40]  due to how heavily
[1766.40 --> 1767.28]  multi-threaded it is.
[1767.32 --> 1767.82]  So more discussion
[1767.82 --> 1768.30]  on that later.
[1768.50 --> 1768.78]  Interesting.
[1769.04 --> 1769.68]  But in general,
[1769.80 --> 1770.76]  we use AMD for our,
[1770.84 --> 1772.48]  Intel for our test platform
[1772.48 --> 1773.70]  because it does perform better.
[1773.70 --> 1775.92]  Like Antec or whatever else.
[1775.92 --> 1777.44]  Like as long as it's not,
[1777.74 --> 1778.54]  as long as it doesn't have
[1778.54 --> 1779.28]  anything to do with
[1779.28 --> 1780.18]  the benchmarks
[1780.18 --> 1781.00]  that we're currently running,
[1781.26 --> 1782.62]  it's not really a big deal.
[1782.74 --> 1782.88]  Yeah.
[1783.00 --> 1783.26]  So,
[1783.38 --> 1783.78]  so yeah,
[1783.84 --> 1784.12]  anyway,
[1784.30 --> 1786.14]  so while we will necessarily,
[1786.30 --> 1787.06]  while we will have
[1787.06 --> 1788.38]  sponsored content at times,
[1788.40 --> 1789.78]  it's not going to be things
[1789.78 --> 1792.18]  like graphics card reviews
[1792.18 --> 1793.04]  or anything like that.
[1793.04 --> 1793.86]  So we didn't,
[1793.86 --> 1795.02]  didn't indeed get a check
[1795.02 --> 1795.58]  from NVIDIA.
[1795.70 --> 1796.72]  And you'll always know
[1796.72 --> 1797.78]  because we'll always have
[1797.78 --> 1798.54]  like a pre-roll
[1798.54 --> 1799.44]  or an outro
[1799.44 --> 1800.28]  or something.
[1800.28 --> 1802.86]  like we're not hiding stuff.
[1803.96 --> 1804.44]  Um,
[1805.08 --> 1807.04]  so this is awesome
[1807.04 --> 1809.64]  because I was typing up
[1809.64 --> 1811.36]  an email to myself
[1811.36 --> 1815.00]  to cover all of the
[1815.00 --> 1816.22]  live stream topics
[1816.22 --> 1817.30]  that I wanted to cover.
[1817.46 --> 1818.52]  And did Windows restart on you?
[1818.52 --> 1819.82]  And Windows went and installed
[1819.82 --> 1821.64]  a bunch of Windows updates on me.
[1821.68 --> 1822.46]  You're running Windows 8,
[1822.50 --> 1822.80]  aren't you?
[1823.00 --> 1824.10]  I am running Windows 8.
[1824.16 --> 1825.22]  So you had two days
[1825.22 --> 1826.38]  to run that restart.
[1827.02 --> 1827.92]  I haven't looked at this
[1827.92 --> 1828.82]  computer in two days.
[1828.82 --> 1830.72]  No, but what happened,
[1830.84 --> 1831.28]  here we go,
[1831.32 --> 1831.60]  here we go,
[1831.64 --> 1831.96]  here we go.
[1832.38 --> 1833.68]  Um, what happened was,
[1834.08 --> 1834.82]  it, it, it's,
[1834.82 --> 1835.92]  it's like, um,
[1836.68 --> 1838.64]  which one is it
[1838.64 --> 1839.76]  where it just says,
[1839.84 --> 1840.32]  hey, you've got,
[1840.48 --> 1841.38]  it just brings up
[1841.38 --> 1842.06]  a countdown timer.
[1842.14 --> 1842.96]  You've got five minutes
[1842.96 --> 1844.12]  to tell me not to restart.
[1844.30 --> 1846.28]  And then unlike Windows 7
[1846.28 --> 1847.22]  where it gives you
[1847.22 --> 1847.96]  the option of
[1847.96 --> 1849.08]  delay for an hour,
[1849.22 --> 1849.80]  four hours,
[1849.80 --> 1850.28]  or a day,
[1850.70 --> 1852.68]  there is no delay
[1852.68 --> 1853.20]  for how long.
[1853.22 --> 1853.82]  You just have
[1853.82 --> 1854.44]  that amount of time.
[1854.58 --> 1854.80]  It's like,
[1854.90 --> 1855.66]  which is,
[1855.78 --> 1857.22]  it's inconvenient
[1857.22 --> 1858.72]  for the tech savvy users
[1858.72 --> 1859.58]  who will eventually
[1859.58 --> 1861.46]  put in their updates.
[1862.36 --> 1862.80]  Um,
[1863.32 --> 1864.30]  but I think it's
[1864.30 --> 1865.46]  probably a good thing
[1865.46 --> 1866.68]  for, like,
[1866.72 --> 1867.18]  my mom,
[1867.34 --> 1868.00]  who will have
[1868.00 --> 1869.82]  75 Windows updates
[1869.82 --> 1870.96]  pending when I go over there.
[1870.98 --> 1871.48]  And I'm just like,
[1871.52 --> 1871.74]  ma,
[1872.02 --> 1873.04]  these aren't optional.
[1873.38 --> 1874.22]  Oh, but it says
[1874.22 --> 1874.86]  they're, you know,
[1875.04 --> 1875.58]  recommended.
[1875.78 --> 1876.06]  I'm like,
[1876.10 --> 1876.26]  yeah,
[1876.38 --> 1877.22]  recommended means
[1877.22 --> 1878.02]  just do it.
[1878.40 --> 1879.34]  It doesn't mean
[1879.34 --> 1880.22]  don't do it.
[1880.72 --> 1881.12]  Um.
[1881.12 --> 1882.38]  It's for Bing.
[1884.92 --> 1885.32]  Well,
[1885.58 --> 1886.50]  I don't want to talk
[1886.50 --> 1886.96]  about Bing.
[1888.08 --> 1889.30]  Is this not working?
[1891.40 --> 1891.92]  You're running
[1891.92 --> 1892.32]  batteries?
[1892.84 --> 1893.04]  No.
[1893.04 --> 1893.18]  No.
[1893.64 --> 1894.26]  No, it's working.
[1894.34 --> 1894.74]  It's just not
[1894.74 --> 1895.42]  switching scenes.
[1896.04 --> 1896.72]  That's sort of bizarre.
[1896.92 --> 1897.30]  Okay, well,
[1897.32 --> 1897.64]  there we go.
[1898.06 --> 1898.52]  All right,
[1898.58 --> 1899.34]  so Robert Cook
[1899.34 --> 1900.02]  asks why we didn't
[1900.02 --> 1900.56]  test the Titan
[1900.56 --> 1902.04]  with any GPGPU benchmarks.
[1902.48 --> 1903.22]  We focused on
[1903.22 --> 1903.92]  the gaming aspect
[1903.92 --> 1904.42]  for now.
[1904.52 --> 1905.06]  That's not to say
[1905.06 --> 1905.68]  that there won't be
[1905.68 --> 1906.30]  a follow-up
[1906.30 --> 1907.18]  with GPGPU.
[1907.18 --> 1908.02]  I had someone
[1908.02 --> 1908.64]  send me one
[1908.64 --> 1908.92]  that they,
[1909.04 --> 1909.86]  the Blender one
[1909.86 --> 1910.32]  that we were
[1910.32 --> 1911.10]  thinking of running.
[1911.68 --> 1912.28]  So, yeah,
[1912.50 --> 1913.16]  it might come,
[1913.30 --> 1914.30]  but later.
[1914.90 --> 1915.84]  Kevin asks
[1915.84 --> 1916.70]  what was the case?
[1916.76 --> 1917.08]  It was a
[1917.08 --> 1918.06]  Cubitech Mini Cube.
[1918.66 --> 1919.72]  What does your wife
[1919.72 --> 1920.54]  think of your move
[1920.54 --> 1921.38]  to Linus Media Group?
[1921.44 --> 1922.08]  Is she supportive?
[1922.36 --> 1922.94]  Concerned?
[1923.00 --> 1923.60]  I'd say a little
[1923.60 --> 1924.28]  from column A,
[1924.32 --> 1925.26]  a little from column B.
[1926.70 --> 1927.56]  What's the cheapest
[1927.56 --> 1928.88]  2GB 680 you've seen?
[1928.98 --> 1929.96]  I saw one for $350.
[1930.08 --> 1931.12]  That's a very good price.
[1934.06 --> 1935.36]  That's a really good price.
[1935.48 --> 1936.28]  I think we had one
[1936.28 --> 1936.66]  for,
[1937.18 --> 1938.02]  $350.
[1938.02 --> 1938.42]  Wow.
[1938.62 --> 1939.12]  Yeah, $350.
[1939.50 --> 1940.48]  No, that's really cheap.
[1940.64 --> 1941.66]  I saw a $670
[1941.66 --> 1942.58]  that was under $300
[1942.58 --> 1943.24]  and that was
[1943.24 --> 1943.86]  a really good deal.
[1944.28 --> 1945.30]  Remember that P&Y deal?
[1945.36 --> 1945.56]  Yeah.
[1946.30 --> 1947.16]  We're talking new.
[1947.22 --> 1947.52]  I don't know
[1947.52 --> 1948.00]  what they're like
[1948.00 --> 1948.64]  on the used market.
[1949.90 --> 1951.38]  I have one $660 Ti.
[1951.46 --> 1952.08]  Would it be preferable
[1952.08 --> 1952.56]  to get another
[1952.56 --> 1953.34]  as opposed to a Titan?
[1953.48 --> 1954.00]  Yeah, probably.
[1954.98 --> 1955.84]  Sound is okay.
[1956.62 --> 1957.04]  Great.
[1957.32 --> 1957.86]  Thank you.
[1958.30 --> 1958.66]  No.
[1958.90 --> 1959.52]  Can you put something
[1959.52 --> 1960.42]  that like slicks ducky?
[1960.52 --> 1960.92]  No.
[1961.10 --> 1961.52]  And you spelled
[1961.52 --> 1962.16]  ducky wrong,
[1962.26 --> 1962.82]  so you're not winning
[1962.82 --> 1964.66]  any brownie points
[1964.66 --> 1965.06]  over there.
[1965.06 --> 1968.60]  Should I get a 3D monitor
[1968.60 --> 1969.74]  or get a dual monitor set up?
[1969.78 --> 1970.00]  You know what?
[1970.00 --> 1970.84]  This is a really interesting
[1970.84 --> 1971.56]  discussion topic
[1971.56 --> 1973.40]  that I would love to have
[1973.40 --> 1974.36]  if I could move Twitter
[1974.36 --> 1974.86]  out of the way,
[1974.96 --> 1975.74]  which is not working
[1975.74 --> 1976.66]  with my hotkeys now
[1976.66 --> 1977.26]  for some reason.
[1977.26 --> 1979.56]  You recently upgraded
[1979.56 --> 1979.96]  your monitor.
[1980.06 --> 1980.38]  Why did you do
[1980.38 --> 1980.74]  what you did?
[1980.90 --> 1981.32]  What did you get?
[1982.02 --> 1984.36]  I got two 24-inch
[1984.36 --> 1985.34]  Asus monitors.
[1985.68 --> 1986.52]  ProArt monitors?
[1986.60 --> 1987.18]  ProArt monitors.
[1987.20 --> 1987.54]  You don't give
[1987.54 --> 1988.56]  the necessary information.
[1988.68 --> 1989.36]  That's like all
[1989.36 --> 1990.38]  the information they need.
[1991.10 --> 1991.70]  ProArt.
[1991.92 --> 1992.62]  So friggin' awesome.
[1992.98 --> 1994.88]  The plan was to have
[1994.88 --> 1996.44]  one directly in front of me
[1996.44 --> 1998.10]  and then for like
[1998.10 --> 1999.14]  all my main apps,
[1999.40 --> 2000.20]  or I'm supposed
[2000.20 --> 2000.72]  to be looking there,
[2000.92 --> 2001.72]  all my main apps,
[2001.80 --> 2002.28]  everything that I'm
[2002.28 --> 2003.08]  currently working on,
[2003.14 --> 2003.98]  what I'm currently doing,
[2003.98 --> 2004.92]  and then on the left
[2004.92 --> 2006.16]  was supposed to be
[2006.16 --> 2008.10]  like social media
[2008.10 --> 2009.84]  and audio.
[2010.08 --> 2010.66]  So I have like
[2010.66 --> 2011.50]  my two different
[2011.50 --> 2012.18]  Skypes running,
[2012.62 --> 2013.20]  music,
[2014.18 --> 2014.70]  Xfire,
[2014.88 --> 2015.22]  Steam,
[2015.34 --> 2016.08]  all that kind of stuff
[2016.08 --> 2016.64]  running on my
[2016.64 --> 2017.42]  far left monitor
[2017.42 --> 2018.90]  and then the idea
[2018.90 --> 2019.72]  was that I was supposed
[2019.72 --> 2020.88]  to have a monitor arm
[2020.88 --> 2022.32]  raising another
[2022.32 --> 2023.02]  smaller,
[2023.22 --> 2024.26]  kind of crappier monitor
[2024.26 --> 2025.74]  up and over those two
[2025.74 --> 2027.10]  and pointing down at me
[2027.10 --> 2028.08]  so that I could monitor
[2028.08 --> 2029.70]  my two servers on that
[2029.70 --> 2030.96]  and that was going
[2030.96 --> 2032.10]  to be awesome.
[2032.24 --> 2032.74]  I'm trying to get
[2032.74 --> 2033.96]  to like the undergrads
[2033.98 --> 2035.12]  and gimpy level setup
[2035.12 --> 2036.92]  but not there yet,
[2037.02 --> 2037.46]  getting there.
[2038.66 --> 2039.78]  But then that arm
[2039.78 --> 2041.40]  just sucked.
[2041.84 --> 2042.06]  Yeah.
[2042.34 --> 2042.74]  It failed.
[2043.04 --> 2043.60]  And like the table
[2043.60 --> 2044.10]  was here,
[2044.36 --> 2044.86]  it would be like
[2044.86 --> 2045.62]  oh yeah bro,
[2045.72 --> 2046.32]  the bottom of your
[2046.32 --> 2046.90]  monitor is going
[2046.90 --> 2047.72]  to be here now
[2047.72 --> 2049.18]  which your base
[2049.18 --> 2049.96]  could already do
[2049.96 --> 2050.68]  and I was like
[2050.68 --> 2051.12]  Well you could
[2051.12 --> 2051.88]  reposition it.
[2052.58 --> 2052.98]  The arm?
[2053.46 --> 2053.68]  Yeah.
[2054.10 --> 2054.50]  Barely.
[2054.76 --> 2054.96]  Okay.
[2055.00 --> 2055.32]  Like that,
[2055.44 --> 2055.98]  I'm serious,
[2056.14 --> 2056.50]  like that's,
[2056.86 --> 2057.82]  it didn't get much higher.
[2058.08 --> 2058.92]  It did get higher
[2058.92 --> 2059.92]  but like not really.
[2059.92 --> 2060.48]  So why did you go
[2060.48 --> 2061.10]  dual monitor
[2061.10 --> 2061.88]  as opposed to
[2061.88 --> 2062.78]  some other setup?
[2062.78 --> 2062.84]  Yeah.
[2063.24 --> 2064.22]  Like triple or 3D?
[2064.66 --> 2064.90]  Yeah.
[2065.32 --> 2066.18]  Not interested
[2066.18 --> 2067.60]  whatsoever
[2067.60 --> 2068.86]  in surround gaming.
[2069.40 --> 2069.56]  I,
[2070.00 --> 2071.62]  nope.
[2072.10 --> 2072.96]  Just like,
[2073.40 --> 2074.00]  nope.
[2074.16 --> 2074.84]  I do not like
[2074.84 --> 2075.76]  surround gaming at all
[2075.76 --> 2076.58]  and
[2076.58 --> 2078.50]  3D
[2078.50 --> 2079.82]  gives me headaches
[2079.82 --> 2080.40]  although
[2080.40 --> 2081.04]  when I did
[2081.04 --> 2081.88]  the 3D testing
[2081.88 --> 2083.00]  for
[2083.00 --> 2084.90]  You had never used
[2084.90 --> 2085.84]  3D vision
[2085.84 --> 2086.42]  with light boost?
[2086.42 --> 2087.08]  With light boost.
[2087.08 --> 2087.52]  No.
[2087.92 --> 2088.32]  Ah,
[2088.48 --> 2088.98]  there you go.
[2089.04 --> 2089.98]  It still didn't make
[2089.98 --> 2091.52]  my head feel that great
[2091.52 --> 2092.18]  but when I played
[2092.18 --> 2092.90]  certain games
[2092.90 --> 2093.10]  like,
[2093.24 --> 2093.44]  okay,
[2093.66 --> 2095.02]  with our Skyrim
[2095.02 --> 2095.78]  all modded out
[2095.78 --> 2096.26]  it looked
[2096.26 --> 2097.70]  horrendous.
[2097.86 --> 2098.12]  Oh yeah,
[2098.18 --> 2099.24]  the shadows were all wrong.
[2099.36 --> 2101.28]  But we're 99% sure
[2101.28 --> 2101.66]  that's because
[2101.66 --> 2102.46]  we modded the crap
[2102.46 --> 2102.78]  out of it.
[2103.16 --> 2104.02]  18 mods
[2104.02 --> 2104.86]  from the Steam Workshop.
[2105.30 --> 2105.58]  Yeah,
[2105.76 --> 2106.10]  and like
[2106.10 --> 2106.88]  you can do
[2106.88 --> 2107.62]  way more than that
[2107.62 --> 2108.14]  but just
[2108.14 --> 2109.42]  3D's
[2109.42 --> 2110.58]  not so happy
[2110.58 --> 2111.08]  with that.
[2111.48 --> 2111.86]  But like
[2111.86 --> 2112.68]  Witcher 2,
[2113.48 --> 2114.44]  holy crap.
[2114.44 --> 2115.08]  Well that's a 3D
[2115.08 --> 2115.86]  vision ready title
[2115.86 --> 2116.08]  though,
[2116.12 --> 2116.46]  isn't it?
[2117.00 --> 2117.30]  Yeah.
[2117.44 --> 2117.90]  I think so.
[2117.90 --> 2118.34]  Although
[2118.34 --> 2121.24]  what did NVIDIA rate it?
[2121.32 --> 2121.86]  I think it was just like
[2121.86 --> 2122.16]  fair.
[2122.54 --> 2122.80]  Fair?
[2122.92 --> 2123.06]  Really?
[2123.44 --> 2123.80]  Oh.
[2123.94 --> 2124.42]  I don't remember.
[2124.42 --> 2125.08]  It looks pretty good
[2125.08 --> 2125.18]  in 3D.
[2125.18 --> 2125.80]  I could be remembering
[2125.80 --> 2126.70]  this not very right
[2126.70 --> 2127.82]  because I was really tired
[2127.82 --> 2128.46]  when I did them.
[2128.60 --> 2128.80]  Yeah,
[2128.90 --> 2129.98]  I think he hadn't slept
[2129.98 --> 2130.92]  much in a long time.
[2131.06 --> 2131.26]  Yeah,
[2131.40 --> 2131.68]  so
[2131.68 --> 2132.98]  if it's not fair
[2132.98 --> 2134.76]  don't worry about it.
[2135.14 --> 2135.78]  But like
[2135.78 --> 2136.54]  I'm actually kind of
[2136.54 --> 2137.46]  interested in picking up
[2137.46 --> 2138.24]  Witcher 2 again
[2138.24 --> 2139.26]  and just like
[2139.26 --> 2140.30]  trying to play it 3D
[2140.30 --> 2141.24]  because it looks
[2141.24 --> 2142.20]  so good.
[2142.28 --> 2142.94]  He assumes he gets
[2142.94 --> 2143.70]  to borrow a monitor
[2143.70 --> 2144.18]  I guess
[2144.18 --> 2145.10]  since he just bought
[2145.10 --> 2145.94]  monitors and clearly
[2145.94 --> 2147.10]  isn't buying a 3D monitor.
[2147.56 --> 2148.42]  The assumptions
[2148.42 --> 2149.18]  this guy makes.
[2149.96 --> 2151.26]  So for me
[2151.26 --> 2152.58]  I personally prefer
[2152.58 --> 2154.02]  a single large format
[2154.02 --> 2154.38]  monitor.
[2154.48 --> 2155.88]  He went with dual 24s
[2155.88 --> 2156.88]  whereas I'm using
[2156.88 --> 2157.76]  a 30 inch monitor
[2157.76 --> 2158.24]  right now
[2158.24 --> 2159.32]  and if I was going to
[2159.32 --> 2160.18]  make any changes
[2160.18 --> 2161.02]  to my setup
[2161.02 --> 2162.64]  I would probably
[2162.64 --> 2165.62]  go with 3x2560x1440
[2165.62 --> 2167.54]  or if I can hold
[2167.54 --> 2168.10]  out long enough
[2168.10 --> 2168.52]  I'm going to wait
[2168.52 --> 2169.78]  for a single 4K display
[2169.78 --> 2171.60]  because I don't really
[2171.60 --> 2172.92]  for work
[2172.92 --> 2173.94]  I like having
[2173.94 --> 2174.70]  separate monitors
[2174.70 --> 2176.04]  and that's great
[2176.04 --> 2178.54]  but for play
[2178.54 --> 2179.24]  I'm generally
[2179.24 --> 2180.10]  only really doing
[2180.10 --> 2180.86]  one thing at a time
[2180.86 --> 2182.14]  I'm not copy pasting
[2182.14 --> 2182.98]  a lot of information
[2182.98 --> 2183.64]  from one place
[2183.64 --> 2183.94]  to another
[2183.94 --> 2184.52]  which is the
[2184.52 --> 2185.60]  main benefit
[2185.60 --> 2186.44]  of multiple monitors
[2186.44 --> 2186.70]  to me
[2186.70 --> 2187.88]  is I can read this
[2187.88 --> 2188.70]  while I'm working
[2188.70 --> 2189.28]  on this
[2189.28 --> 2191.08]  and monitoring that.
[2191.08 --> 2193.42]  See my thing is
[2193.42 --> 2193.86]  I like
[2193.86 --> 2195.32]  even if it's just
[2195.32 --> 2195.66]  for play
[2195.66 --> 2196.10]  I like to be able
[2196.10 --> 2196.74]  to see everything
[2196.74 --> 2197.06]  at once
[2197.06 --> 2197.50]  like I said
[2197.50 --> 2198.20]  I have all my
[2198.20 --> 2198.58]  Well then why
[2198.58 --> 2198.86]  don't you get
[2198.86 --> 2199.14]  surrounded?
[2200.38 --> 2201.12]  That doesn't make
[2201.12 --> 2201.44]  any sense
[2201.44 --> 2203.72]  Let me finish talking
[2203.72 --> 2205.78]  See everything at once
[2205.78 --> 2207.40]  not within
[2207.40 --> 2208.54]  the video game
[2208.54 --> 2208.98]  environment
[2208.98 --> 2209.86]  let me get to that
[2209.86 --> 2210.40]  in a moment
[2210.40 --> 2211.20]  sir
[2211.20 --> 2212.24]  first
[2212.24 --> 2213.14]  You're grouchy
[2213.14 --> 2216.98]  First
[2216.98 --> 2218.38]  I want to see
[2218.38 --> 2219.36]  all like
[2219.36 --> 2219.96]  like if someone
[2219.96 --> 2220.88]  messages me on Skype
[2220.88 --> 2221.46]  and I'm in a game
[2221.46 --> 2221.88]  I don't want to
[2221.88 --> 2222.84]  tab out to look at it
[2222.84 --> 2224.20]  I want it to just
[2224.20 --> 2224.80]  be right there
[2224.80 --> 2225.54]  If someone messages me
[2225.54 --> 2225.98]  on Xfire
[2225.98 --> 2226.54]  and I'm in a game
[2226.54 --> 2227.50]  I want it to be right there
[2227.50 --> 2228.74]  If something happens
[2228.74 --> 2229.38]  on one of my servers
[2229.38 --> 2230.30]  I want it to be right there
[2230.30 --> 2230.84]  I want to be able to
[2230.84 --> 2231.44]  see everything
[2231.44 --> 2232.16]  at all points of time
[2232.16 --> 2232.80]  I like that
[2232.80 --> 2233.64]  So basically
[2233.64 --> 2234.44]  you want to be God
[2234.44 --> 2235.00]  Yep
[2235.00 --> 2238.34]  At least you're clear
[2238.34 --> 2238.60]  right?
[2239.72 --> 2240.86]  And then when I'm gaming
[2240.86 --> 2241.90]  I don't really like
[2241.90 --> 2242.92]  anything larger
[2242.92 --> 2243.78]  than a 24 inch
[2243.78 --> 2244.46]  because if
[2244.46 --> 2245.56]  and even 24 inch
[2245.56 --> 2246.46]  is like kind of
[2246.46 --> 2247.74]  borderline for this
[2247.74 --> 2249.28]  is because if I have to
[2249.28 --> 2250.78]  like look
[2250.78 --> 2252.26]  to see something
[2252.26 --> 2254.34]  that probably took too long
[2254.34 --> 2255.88]  and I'm probably dead
[2255.88 --> 2259.56]  Okay
[2259.56 --> 2260.64]  Fine
[2260.64 --> 2261.74]  Okay so basically
[2261.74 --> 2262.60]  neither of us
[2262.60 --> 2263.64]  is necessarily going
[2263.64 --> 2264.70]  3D anytime soon
[2264.70 --> 2265.20]  However
[2265.20 --> 2266.74]  I would definitely
[2266.74 --> 2267.60]  go 3D on a
[2267.60 --> 2268.34]  projector setup
[2268.34 --> 2270.06]  because I find
[2270.06 --> 2271.86]  the pixel response
[2271.86 --> 2272.80]  times on LCD
[2272.80 --> 2274.10]  are still too slow
[2274.10 --> 2276.02]  for me to really enjoy 3D
[2276.02 --> 2277.08]  because I can still see
[2277.08 --> 2277.90]  a little bit of
[2277.90 --> 2279.22]  crosstalk between the images
[2279.22 --> 2281.02]  however on a DLP projector
[2281.02 --> 2283.56]  DLP is fast enough
[2283.56 --> 2285.32]  however the last 3D DLP
[2285.32 --> 2286.44]  I don't think I told you this
[2286.44 --> 2287.74]  I've never seen the rainbow
[2287.74 --> 2288.42]  effect before
[2288.42 --> 2289.26]  on a DLP
[2289.26 --> 2291.44]  the last one that I used
[2291.44 --> 2292.28]  that 3D one
[2292.28 --> 2293.46]  from BenQ
[2293.46 --> 2294.70]  hardcore saw it
[2294.70 --> 2296.44]  so when your eyes
[2296.44 --> 2297.32]  flick from one point
[2297.32 --> 2297.74]  on the screen
[2297.74 --> 2298.18]  to another
[2298.18 --> 2299.68]  you see a rainbow
[2299.68 --> 2301.40]  on any sharp lines
[2301.40 --> 2302.98]  and I was really
[2302.98 --> 2303.62]  really disappointed
[2303.62 --> 2303.96]  with that
[2303.96 --> 2304.74]  because what I'm waiting
[2304.74 --> 2306.60]  for is a 3D solution
[2306.60 --> 2308.60]  an OLED 3D display
[2308.60 --> 2309.20]  would be like
[2309.20 --> 2309.66]  awesome
[2309.66 --> 2310.32]  because the response
[2310.32 --> 2310.94]  times are great
[2310.94 --> 2311.58]  so I'm waiting
[2311.58 --> 2312.40]  for a 3D solution
[2312.40 --> 2313.14]  that I can really
[2313.14 --> 2313.88]  really get into
[2313.88 --> 2315.60]  you know what
[2315.60 --> 2316.16]  let's do
[2316.16 --> 2317.86]  let's do Tesla Model S
[2317.86 --> 2318.86]  so Slick wasn't there
[2318.86 --> 2319.48]  when I was
[2319.48 --> 2320.60]  when I was prepping this
[2320.60 --> 2321.80]  but I had a few people
[2321.80 --> 2323.26]  who were a little bit upset
[2323.26 --> 2325.02]  with how quick we were
[2325.02 --> 2327.58]  to jump on the writer
[2327.58 --> 2329.18]  what was his name again
[2329.18 --> 2329.92]  Broders
[2329.92 --> 2331.42]  to jump on the writer
[2331.42 --> 2332.32]  of the article
[2332.32 --> 2333.78]  that basically
[2333.78 --> 2334.72]  kind of said
[2334.72 --> 2336.06]  Tesla Model S
[2336.06 --> 2337.18]  is not really ready
[2337.18 --> 2337.66]  for
[2337.66 --> 2338.20]  for
[2338.20 --> 2340.10]  what I do
[2340.10 --> 2341.42]  oh there goes my
[2341.42 --> 2342.16]  there goes my list
[2342.16 --> 2342.78]  of stuff again
[2342.78 --> 2343.96]  Tesla Model S
[2343.96 --> 2344.64]  is not ready
[2344.64 --> 2345.68]  for prime time
[2345.68 --> 2347.38]  and you know
[2347.38 --> 2349.24]  the rated range
[2349.24 --> 2349.78]  is not
[2349.78 --> 2350.84]  not what they're saying
[2350.84 --> 2351.32]  it is
[2351.32 --> 2353.06]  where Tesla came back
[2353.06 --> 2353.56]  and said
[2353.56 --> 2354.66]  blah blah blah blah blah
[2354.66 --> 2356.28]  basically called it a fake
[2356.28 --> 2357.70]  CEO of Tesla
[2357.70 --> 2359.10]  well part time CEO of Tesla
[2359.10 --> 2360.26]  called it a fake
[2360.26 --> 2361.44]  and said that the writer
[2361.44 --> 2362.88]  screwed up a bunch of things
[2362.88 --> 2364.68]  so there's more discussion
[2364.68 --> 2365.52]  to be had here
[2365.52 --> 2366.48]  and we shouldn't have
[2366.48 --> 2367.22]  jumped on the writer
[2367.22 --> 2367.84]  so quickly
[2367.84 --> 2370.04]  because it's a week later now
[2370.04 --> 2371.12]  and that was already
[2371.12 --> 2371.80]  going on
[2371.80 --> 2372.66]  for a little bit
[2372.66 --> 2374.60]  and this is still
[2374.60 --> 2375.44]  a pending
[2375.44 --> 2376.52]  like ongoing
[2376.52 --> 2377.16]  thing
[2377.16 --> 2378.12]  because there's more to it
[2378.12 --> 2378.72]  than just that
[2378.72 --> 2379.02]  so
[2379.02 --> 2381.24]  so Tesla is making claims
[2381.24 --> 2381.94]  about the range
[2381.94 --> 2382.32]  saying
[2382.32 --> 2382.88]  you know
[2382.88 --> 2384.24]  the writer should have
[2384.24 --> 2385.58]  driven it in this exact way
[2385.58 --> 2386.32]  and should have done this
[2386.32 --> 2386.98]  and done that
[2386.98 --> 2390.26]  where the writer was more
[2390.26 --> 2391.00]  approaching it
[2391.00 --> 2392.20]  from an everyman perspective
[2392.20 --> 2392.98]  that's sort of the way
[2392.98 --> 2394.04]  that he's presenting this
[2394.04 --> 2394.46]  where he's saying
[2394.46 --> 2395.92]  well what if I wasn't an expert
[2395.92 --> 2397.22]  and what if I didn't
[2397.22 --> 2398.18]  necessarily understand
[2398.18 --> 2399.56]  all the finest details
[2399.56 --> 2400.64]  of the Model S
[2400.64 --> 2401.54]  and how it should be driven
[2401.54 --> 2402.46]  for optimal range
[2402.46 --> 2403.48]  what if I was just a dude
[2403.48 --> 2404.40]  getting in his car
[2404.40 --> 2405.38]  going on a road trip
[2405.38 --> 2406.40]  with the point
[2406.40 --> 2407.80]  Tesla was trying to make
[2407.80 --> 2408.66]  with this demonstration
[2408.66 --> 2409.58]  being that it's
[2409.58 --> 2410.46]  a replacement
[2410.46 --> 2411.88]  for a gasoline car
[2411.88 --> 2415.30]  so was the writer wrong
[2415.30 --> 2415.80]  probably
[2415.80 --> 2416.46]  in fact
[2416.46 --> 2417.28]  New York Times
[2417.28 --> 2417.70]  his editor
[2417.70 --> 2418.64]  has actually come out
[2418.64 --> 2419.12]  and says
[2419.12 --> 2420.44]  his imprecise
[2420.44 --> 2421.66]  and casual notes
[2421.66 --> 2423.78]  left his article
[2423.78 --> 2424.86]  open to criticism
[2424.86 --> 2426.24]  so that's not quite
[2426.24 --> 2427.26]  an admission of fault
[2427.26 --> 2429.10]  but you know
[2429.10 --> 2430.00]  she also believes
[2430.00 --> 2430.58]  that he was taking
[2430.58 --> 2431.60]  the drive in good faith
[2431.60 --> 2433.28]  and okay
[2433.28 --> 2435.12]  so in Tesla's defense
[2435.12 --> 2436.04]  there have actually
[2436.04 --> 2437.00]  been Tesla owners
[2437.00 --> 2437.56]  who have done
[2437.56 --> 2438.38]  that same drive
[2438.38 --> 2439.66]  to see if it can be done
[2439.66 --> 2441.04]  but it's unknown
[2441.04 --> 2442.24]  how much the cold weather
[2442.24 --> 2442.82]  was impacting
[2442.82 --> 2443.66]  the battery life
[2443.66 --> 2444.80]  and it does
[2444.80 --> 2446.72]  and more than Tesla claims
[2446.72 --> 2448.38]  Tesla claims only about 10%
[2448.38 --> 2449.04]  which is the same
[2449.04 --> 2450.00]  as a gasoline engine
[2450.00 --> 2451.54]  but that's been shown
[2451.54 --> 2452.80]  to be not quite true
[2452.80 --> 2454.50]  in a number of different places
[2454.50 --> 2457.10]  so we don't know
[2457.10 --> 2457.58]  how much of it
[2457.58 --> 2458.76]  was the cold weather impact
[2458.76 --> 2459.48]  we don't know
[2459.48 --> 2460.10]  how much of it
[2460.10 --> 2460.88]  might have been
[2460.88 --> 2462.46]  a faulty charging station
[2462.46 --> 2463.20]  because
[2463.20 --> 2463.64]  I don't know
[2463.64 --> 2464.46]  if you know about this
[2464.46 --> 2466.08]  but some of the Tesla owners
[2466.08 --> 2467.90]  who tried to repeat the drive
[2467.90 --> 2469.46]  actually ran into trouble
[2469.46 --> 2470.80]  with one of the charging stations
[2470.80 --> 2471.52]  bricking
[2471.52 --> 2472.82]  and then refusing to charge
[2472.82 --> 2473.56]  a couple of the cars
[2473.56 --> 2474.66]  and Tesla had to
[2474.66 --> 2476.78]  reboot or update the firmware
[2476.78 --> 2477.24]  or something
[2477.24 --> 2478.18]  on the charging station
[2478.18 --> 2478.84]  and those cars
[2478.84 --> 2480.04]  for that whole convoy
[2480.04 --> 2480.74]  to get going again
[2480.74 --> 2482.38]  so it wasn't without hiccups either
[2482.38 --> 2485.16]  so right now
[2485.16 --> 2486.70]  what I would like to say
[2486.70 --> 2488.20]  is I shouldn't have been hasty
[2488.20 --> 2489.48]  and I will avoid doing that
[2489.48 --> 2489.98]  in the future
[2489.98 --> 2491.12]  and this is still
[2491.12 --> 2491.94]  very much ongoing
[2491.94 --> 2493.64]  so we're reserving judgment
[2493.64 --> 2494.60]  but
[2494.60 --> 2496.10]  the writer should have been
[2496.10 --> 2496.58]  more diligent
[2496.58 --> 2497.34]  his own editor
[2497.34 --> 2498.90]  has called him sloppy
[2498.90 --> 2499.46]  and
[2499.46 --> 2500.74]  or imprecise and casual
[2500.74 --> 2501.82]  I don't want to make sure
[2501.82 --> 2502.58]  I use the right words
[2502.58 --> 2503.36]  because that's exactly
[2503.36 --> 2503.98]  what she said
[2503.98 --> 2506.32]  and Tesla also needs to
[2506.32 --> 2507.76]  I think they're playing this up
[2507.76 --> 2508.20]  a little bit
[2508.20 --> 2509.06]  because there's
[2509.06 --> 2509.84]  the saying is
[2509.84 --> 2510.68]  there's no such thing
[2510.68 --> 2511.42]  as bad press
[2511.42 --> 2512.24]  this hype for them
[2512.24 --> 2512.94]  is really good
[2512.94 --> 2513.88]  considering we just
[2513.88 --> 2514.64]  jumped on board
[2514.64 --> 2515.92]  everybody's talking about
[2515.92 --> 2517.08]  the Tesla Model S
[2517.08 --> 2518.14]  in our defense
[2518.14 --> 2519.10]  we've never talked about
[2519.10 --> 2519.78]  a car ever
[2519.78 --> 2520.36]  yeah
[2520.36 --> 2520.72]  yeah
[2520.72 --> 2521.10]  yeah
[2521.10 --> 2522.06]  anyway in our defense
[2522.06 --> 2522.80]  in our defense
[2522.80 --> 2524.26]  when we jumped on this
[2524.26 --> 2525.74]  there was not very much
[2525.74 --> 2526.60]  online about it
[2526.60 --> 2528.70]  I had read about this
[2528.70 --> 2529.90]  like that morning
[2529.90 --> 2531.02]  and then we tried
[2531.02 --> 2532.48]  to come up with something
[2532.48 --> 2533.16]  yeah
[2533.16 --> 2534.56]  we were discussing it
[2534.56 --> 2536.12]  and we tended
[2536.12 --> 2537.20]  to side with
[2537.20 --> 2537.84]  I mean I think
[2537.84 --> 2538.96]  naturally we're both geeks
[2538.96 --> 2539.26]  it was
[2539.26 --> 2540.10]  and it was a
[2540.10 --> 2540.82]  yeah so it's
[2540.82 --> 2541.66]  side with the tech company
[2541.66 --> 2542.28]  we wanted
[2542.28 --> 2544.08]  it was a gawker post
[2544.08 --> 2544.62]  we were reading
[2544.62 --> 2545.02]  yeah
[2545.02 --> 2545.42]  so
[2545.42 --> 2546.58]  so we I mean
[2546.58 --> 2547.54]  we wanted Tesla
[2547.54 --> 2548.62]  to be sort of
[2548.62 --> 2549.20]  you know blameless
[2549.20 --> 2549.68]  and all of this
[2549.68 --> 2550.72]  we want the electric car
[2550.72 --> 2551.20]  to be like
[2551.20 --> 2552.06]  I would love
[2552.06 --> 2552.98]  for the next car
[2552.98 --> 2553.72]  I buy to be electric
[2553.72 --> 2554.66]  yeah that'd be awesome
[2554.66 --> 2555.50]  would love for that
[2555.50 --> 2556.70]  I mean my car right now
[2556.70 --> 2558.66]  is 168,000 kilometers on it
[2558.66 --> 2560.26]  if I can go
[2560.26 --> 2561.28]  the kind of kilometers
[2561.28 --> 2562.14]  I'm putting on it now
[2562.14 --> 2563.86]  if that car goes 200 to 250
[2563.86 --> 2565.30]  I could probably buy
[2565.30 --> 2565.98]  an electric car
[2565.98 --> 2566.98]  feasibly the next time
[2566.98 --> 2567.62]  I buy an automobile
[2567.62 --> 2569.10]  which would be awesome
[2569.10 --> 2570.16]  which would be amazing
[2570.16 --> 2570.52]  because like
[2570.52 --> 2571.38]  you can buy electric cars
[2571.38 --> 2572.12]  right now
[2572.12 --> 2573.18]  and one of my really good
[2573.18 --> 2573.94]  friends has one
[2573.94 --> 2575.26]  but talking to him
[2575.26 --> 2576.34]  about some of the stuff
[2576.34 --> 2577.18]  that he has to go through
[2577.18 --> 2578.26]  to like make sure
[2578.26 --> 2580.02]  that everything will work
[2580.02 --> 2581.56]  you know what would be so cool
[2581.56 --> 2583.20]  wireless charging electric cars
[2583.20 --> 2585.22]  so you pull into
[2585.22 --> 2586.50]  so like you know
[2586.50 --> 2587.42]  high end homes
[2587.42 --> 2588.34]  will have a garage
[2588.34 --> 2588.94]  that's outfitted
[2588.94 --> 2589.66]  with wireless charging
[2589.66 --> 2590.58]  so they could have like
[2590.58 --> 2592.80]  like a human proximity sensor
[2592.80 --> 2593.62]  because I'd imagine
[2593.62 --> 2594.80]  that anything that can provide
[2594.80 --> 2595.66]  that kind of current
[2595.66 --> 2597.44]  over wirelessly
[2597.44 --> 2598.32]  would not necessarily
[2598.32 --> 2598.86]  be that safe
[2598.86 --> 2599.70]  to stand next to
[2599.70 --> 2601.90]  research Tesla sir
[2601.90 --> 2602.72]  well okay
[2602.72 --> 2603.50]  besides that
[2603.50 --> 2604.18]  but has that ever
[2604.18 --> 2605.14]  actually been implemented
[2605.14 --> 2605.82]  in anything
[2605.82 --> 2608.72]  there you go
[2608.72 --> 2609.46]  someone will figure it out
[2609.46 --> 2610.04]  I don't know
[2610.04 --> 2611.20]  I haven't researched it enough
[2611.20 --> 2613.10]  but someone will figure it out
[2613.10 --> 2613.44]  and maybe
[2613.44 --> 2614.18]  someone will figure it out
[2614.18 --> 2614.66]  let's hope
[2614.66 --> 2615.28]  let's hope
[2615.28 --> 2616.54]  and and I mean
[2616.54 --> 2618.24]  if someone can figure out
[2618.24 --> 2618.98]  how to meter it
[2618.98 --> 2619.58]  then great
[2619.58 --> 2621.38]  but until then
[2621.38 --> 2622.50]  it's not a conversation
[2622.50 --> 2622.96]  we're having
[2622.96 --> 2624.32]  so we're going to be looking
[2624.32 --> 2625.08]  at conventional
[2625.08 --> 2626.90]  conventional wireless charging
[2626.90 --> 2628.24]  so if they had something
[2628.24 --> 2629.44]  like a proximity sensor
[2629.44 --> 2630.50]  so there's no one nearby
[2630.50 --> 2632.10]  and it was self-contained
[2632.10 --> 2632.78]  in such a way
[2632.78 --> 2633.36]  that I don't know
[2633.36 --> 2634.16]  you know you put lead
[2634.16 --> 2635.02]  on all sides of it
[2635.02 --> 2635.88]  except the direction
[2635.88 --> 2635.94]  it needs to go
[2635.94 --> 2636.92]  just be in the very floor
[2636.92 --> 2637.94]  and when you drive in
[2637.94 --> 2639.12]  it detects your car is there
[2639.12 --> 2639.40]  and just
[2639.40 --> 2641.08]  or something like that
[2641.08 --> 2641.82]  something like that
[2641.82 --> 2642.32]  or even
[2642.32 --> 2643.96]  I mean who knows
[2643.96 --> 2644.54]  I mean by then
[2644.54 --> 2645.28]  it might be even
[2645.28 --> 2646.24]  cheaper and easier
[2646.24 --> 2647.76]  to build like a robotic arm
[2647.76 --> 2648.58]  that just detects
[2648.58 --> 2649.22]  your cars nearby
[2649.22 --> 2650.34]  finds the outlet
[2650.34 --> 2651.44]  and then latches on
[2651.44 --> 2653.86]  exactly like I don't know
[2653.86 --> 2655.44]  I actually don't know
[2655.44 --> 2656.54]  this is us just kind of
[2656.54 --> 2657.36]  talking about things
[2657.36 --> 2658.42]  that are kind of stupid
[2658.42 --> 2659.64]  I realize at this point
[2659.64 --> 2661.08]  but you know
[2661.08 --> 2662.06]  I'd love for that
[2662.06 --> 2663.14]  you pull into your garage
[2663.14 --> 2663.98]  your car charges
[2663.98 --> 2665.98]  and yeah
[2665.98 --> 2666.98]  because you don't want to
[2666.98 --> 2667.56]  have to think about
[2667.56 --> 2668.40]  the plug every time
[2668.40 --> 2669.40]  because then the one time
[2669.40 --> 2670.94]  you forget about the plug
[2670.94 --> 2672.22]  you can't drive to work
[2672.22 --> 2672.68]  in the morning
[2672.68 --> 2673.40]  and your boss is like
[2673.40 --> 2674.14]  you're fired
[2674.14 --> 2675.72]  that's not very fun
[2675.72 --> 2676.58]  you're fired just for
[2676.58 --> 2677.86]  talking about not being at work
[2677.86 --> 2679.08]  that's the first time today
[2679.08 --> 2680.22]  which by the way
[2680.22 --> 2681.16]  you weren't at work
[2681.16 --> 2681.58]  from the beginning
[2681.58 --> 2682.30]  of the live stream
[2682.30 --> 2683.20]  so you were hardcore
[2683.20 --> 2684.10]  fired for that
[2684.10 --> 2686.16]  like so fired
[2686.16 --> 2688.06]  okay we've got
[2688.06 --> 2689.28]  one more twitter question
[2689.28 --> 2690.16]  here that I did want
[2690.16 --> 2691.16]  to get to
[2691.16 --> 2693.26]  favorite piece
[2693.26 --> 2694.76]  of
[2694.76 --> 2696.88]  I'm trying
[2696.88 --> 2698.52]  trying to scroll down
[2698.52 --> 2701.14]  I know they don't come
[2701.14 --> 2701.98]  with dust out of the box
[2701.98 --> 2702.46]  come on man
[2702.46 --> 2703.88]  favorite piece of technology
[2703.88 --> 2704.84]  you've purchased ever
[2704.84 --> 2706.20]  that's a great question
[2706.20 --> 2709.34]  I'm going to go first
[2709.34 --> 2710.86]  and I'm going to narrow
[2710.86 --> 2712.32]  the scope to computer
[2712.32 --> 2713.60]  technology because that's
[2713.60 --> 2715.26]  mostly what we cover here
[2715.26 --> 2717.34]  so a lot of the stuff
[2717.34 --> 2718.12]  that I have
[2718.12 --> 2719.40]  I didn't purchase
[2719.40 --> 2720.04]  per se
[2720.04 --> 2720.72]  so it's
[2720.72 --> 2721.66]  I mean probably
[2721.66 --> 2722.64]  almost everything you see
[2722.64 --> 2723.70]  on the table behind me
[2723.70 --> 2725.22]  was samples provided
[2725.22 --> 2726.02]  by manufacturers
[2726.02 --> 2727.36]  for us to do testing on
[2727.36 --> 2728.54]  for us to make videos about
[2728.54 --> 2730.14]  for us to just
[2730.14 --> 2730.90]  you know
[2730.90 --> 2731.80]  kind of talk about
[2731.80 --> 2732.74]  so that I'll actually
[2732.74 --> 2733.82]  know what I'm talking about
[2733.82 --> 2735.32]  I mean it's in their best interest
[2735.32 --> 2736.34]  for me to understand
[2736.34 --> 2737.22]  their products well enough
[2737.22 --> 2737.96]  to talk about them
[2737.96 --> 2739.56]  I think sort of at this point
[2739.56 --> 2740.54]  we can all agree on that
[2740.54 --> 2741.12]  so basically
[2741.12 --> 2742.30]  give us a Tesla
[2742.30 --> 2744.04]  yeah basically
[2744.04 --> 2745.02]  basically
[2745.02 --> 2746.88]  we're the only credible source
[2746.88 --> 2747.72]  so you might as well
[2747.72 --> 2748.60]  give us one of the cars
[2748.60 --> 2749.32]  so we can check that
[2749.32 --> 2750.48]  in all seriousness
[2750.48 --> 2751.42]  would we have time
[2751.42 --> 2753.06]  to do a Tesla test drive?
[2753.08 --> 2754.06]  I think if they gave us
[2754.06 --> 2755.04]  a Tesla Model S
[2755.04 --> 2755.68]  we could probably
[2755.68 --> 2756.72]  not even New York Times
[2756.72 --> 2757.54]  got to keep the car
[2757.54 --> 2758.08]  so
[2758.08 --> 2759.56]  no we'd have to
[2759.56 --> 2760.00]  yeah
[2760.00 --> 2761.22]  obviously we have to keep the car
[2761.22 --> 2761.86]  so yeah
[2761.86 --> 2762.58]  I think
[2762.58 --> 2763.96]  this is even stupider
[2763.96 --> 2764.72]  than the conversation
[2764.72 --> 2765.38]  we were having
[2765.38 --> 2766.66]  about the garage charging
[2766.66 --> 2767.86]  by the way
[2767.86 --> 2769.04]  stupider is apparently
[2769.04 --> 2769.86]  becoming a word
[2769.86 --> 2771.52]  yeah
[2771.52 --> 2771.90]  I know
[2771.90 --> 2772.86]  I heard this from my mom
[2772.86 --> 2773.66]  she's one of those
[2773.66 --> 2774.56]  English major
[2774.56 --> 2775.52]  artsy people
[2775.52 --> 2776.72]  who is of course
[2776.72 --> 2777.66]  super offended
[2777.66 --> 2778.48]  about this
[2778.48 --> 2778.82]  but
[2778.82 --> 2779.74]  yep
[2779.74 --> 2780.38]  stupider
[2780.38 --> 2781.50]  stupider is apparently
[2781.50 --> 2782.44]  making its way
[2782.44 --> 2783.22]  to becoming a word
[2783.22 --> 2783.86]  I mean what's next
[2783.86 --> 2784.26]  funner?
[2785.64 --> 2786.12]  seriously
[2786.12 --> 2787.64]  that's the stupidest thing
[2787.64 --> 2788.06]  I ever heard
[2788.06 --> 2789.48]  which also isn't a word
[2789.48 --> 2790.78]  and still
[2790.78 --> 2791.78]  probably isn't a word
[2791.78 --> 2792.52]  did you say
[2792.52 --> 2793.40]  stupiderst?
[2793.40 --> 2794.40]  stupidest
[2794.40 --> 2795.16]  stupidest
[2795.16 --> 2795.94]  also is not a word
[2795.94 --> 2796.78]  it's more stupid
[2796.78 --> 2797.64]  and
[2797.64 --> 2798.98]  yeah
[2798.98 --> 2800.58]  or most stupid
[2800.58 --> 2801.90]  that's pretty much
[2801.90 --> 2803.00]  the only way
[2803.00 --> 2803.68]  that that can be done
[2803.68 --> 2805.26]  what was I even talking about?
[2805.36 --> 2805.46]  right
[2805.46 --> 2805.76]  favorite
[2805.76 --> 2806.88]  so my favorite
[2806.88 --> 2808.24]  technology piece
[2808.24 --> 2809.76]  that I ever actually bought
[2809.76 --> 2810.50]  was my
[2810.50 --> 2811.48]  Athlon 64
[2811.48 --> 2812.04]  X2
[2812.04 --> 2813.22]  4400 plus
[2813.22 --> 2814.38]  that thing was
[2814.38 --> 2815.12]  freaking
[2815.12 --> 2815.88]  awesome
[2815.88 --> 2816.90]  not only
[2816.90 --> 2817.48]  was it
[2817.48 --> 2818.10]  faster
[2818.10 --> 2819.08]  tangibly
[2819.08 --> 2820.02]  in benchmarks
[2820.02 --> 2821.16]  there are
[2821.16 --> 2821.74]  measurably
[2821.74 --> 2822.60]  in benchmarks
[2822.60 --> 2823.72]  than anything else
[2823.72 --> 2824.20]  on the market
[2824.20 --> 2824.98]  by just
[2824.98 --> 2826.16]  a landslide
[2826.16 --> 2827.04]  with the exception
[2827.04 --> 2828.12]  of the 4800 plus
[2828.12 --> 2828.74]  which was slightly
[2828.74 --> 2829.44]  faster than the
[2829.44 --> 2830.26]  4400 plus
[2830.26 --> 2832.78]  what core was that?
[2832.86 --> 2833.18]  that wasn't
[2833.18 --> 2833.66]  claw hammer
[2833.66 --> 2834.22]  was it?
[2834.32 --> 2836.32]  I don't remember anymore
[2836.32 --> 2837.28]  it's been way too long
[2837.28 --> 2838.10]  holy crap
[2838.10 --> 2838.78]  no claw hammer
[2838.78 --> 2839.54]  was before that
[2839.54 --> 2840.00]  claw hammer
[2840.00 --> 2841.46]  was my 3500 plus
[2841.46 --> 2842.18]  I love the name
[2842.18 --> 2842.84]  of them before
[2842.84 --> 2843.42]  I know
[2843.42 --> 2844.22]  back then you were
[2844.22 --> 2845.04]  so cool
[2845.04 --> 2847.28]  sledgehammer
[2847.28 --> 2848.04]  was the original
[2848.04 --> 2848.82]  FX I believe
[2848.82 --> 2849.14]  anyway
[2849.14 --> 2849.62]  you know how
[2849.62 --> 2850.48]  every graphics card
[2850.48 --> 2851.06]  used to come with
[2851.06 --> 2851.96]  the most epic
[2851.96 --> 2853.06]  like box art?
[2853.66 --> 2853.88]  yes
[2853.88 --> 2854.56]  it was just
[2854.56 --> 2855.56]  so cool
[2855.56 --> 2856.14]  and now they're
[2856.14 --> 2857.08]  like super conservative
[2857.08 --> 2858.88]  I actually prefer
[2858.88 --> 2860.00]  the conservative box art
[2860.00 --> 2860.30]  really?
[2860.60 --> 2861.02]  screw you old man
[2861.02 --> 2861.26]  come on
[2861.26 --> 2861.94]  pallet frog
[2861.94 --> 2863.04]  screw you old man
[2863.04 --> 2863.70]  I mean remember
[2863.70 --> 2864.60]  like MSIs
[2864.60 --> 2865.66]  and Asus's old cards
[2865.66 --> 2866.30]  where they just had
[2866.30 --> 2866.90]  like weird
[2866.90 --> 2867.72]  like characters
[2867.72 --> 2868.74]  and armor on the front
[2868.74 --> 2869.14]  and you're just like
[2869.14 --> 2869.90]  that's amazing
[2869.90 --> 2871.10]  that's not even a game
[2871.10 --> 2871.86]  it's not even from
[2871.86 --> 2872.28]  anything
[2872.28 --> 2873.22]  it's not from anything
[2873.22 --> 2874.90]  it's like these
[2874.90 --> 2876.52]  companies had a dedicated
[2876.52 --> 2878.08]  guy on staff
[2878.08 --> 2878.48]  who just
[2878.48 --> 2880.10]  drew random
[2880.10 --> 2882.12]  crap to put on
[2882.12 --> 2882.60]  their box art
[2882.60 --> 2883.24]  it looks like
[2883.24 --> 2884.02]  it could be from
[2884.02 --> 2884.42]  a game
[2884.42 --> 2885.26]  good enough
[2885.26 --> 2886.74]  it's ridiculous
[2886.74 --> 2887.78]  it was cool
[2887.78 --> 2889.68]  anyway the 4400 plus
[2889.68 --> 2890.40]  they're in 90s
[2890.40 --> 2891.58]  changed the way
[2891.58 --> 2892.58]  I used my computer
[2892.58 --> 2893.38]  in a way that
[2893.38 --> 2895.18]  probably nothing else
[2895.18 --> 2896.44]  has since then
[2896.44 --> 2898.32]  SSD was close for me
[2898.32 --> 2899.02]  in fact SSD
[2899.02 --> 2900.18]  was probably a similar
[2900.18 --> 2901.06]  quantum leap
[2901.06 --> 2902.30]  in the responsiveness
[2902.30 --> 2903.12]  of a desktop
[2903.12 --> 2903.62]  computer
[2903.62 --> 2904.90]  but unlike
[2904.90 --> 2906.38]  that processor
[2906.38 --> 2906.92]  that move
[2906.92 --> 2907.40]  from single
[2907.40 --> 2908.28]  to dual core
[2908.28 --> 2909.54]  unlike that
[2909.54 --> 2910.64]  SSD did not
[2910.64 --> 2911.24]  improve gaming
[2911.24 --> 2911.78]  in any way
[2911.78 --> 2913.10]  so that's
[2913.10 --> 2913.54]  or okay
[2913.54 --> 2914.14]  load times
[2914.14 --> 2914.82]  are slightly lower
[2914.82 --> 2916.26]  but it didn't
[2916.26 --> 2917.34]  improve frame rates
[2917.34 --> 2918.88]  so that processor
[2918.88 --> 2920.06]  improved frame rates
[2920.06 --> 2921.06]  in a tangible way
[2921.06 --> 2923.20]  and it just
[2923.20 --> 2924.24]  destroyed
[2924.24 --> 2925.10]  anything else
[2925.10 --> 2925.60]  on the market
[2925.60 --> 2926.58]  from a multitasking
[2926.58 --> 2927.06]  perspective
[2927.06 --> 2927.98]  so it made it
[2927.98 --> 2928.84]  so I was actually
[2928.84 --> 2930.04]  legitimately able
[2930.04 --> 2931.22]  to use my computer
[2931.22 --> 2931.90]  to do multiple
[2931.90 --> 2932.84]  things at a time
[2932.84 --> 2933.74]  in a way that
[2933.74 --> 2934.66]  just wasn't
[2934.66 --> 2935.38]  possible up till
[2935.38 --> 2935.56]  then
[2935.56 --> 2937.28]  so in terms of
[2937.28 --> 2938.04]  and I mean
[2938.04 --> 2938.92]  I bought processors
[2938.92 --> 2940.36]  before and after
[2940.36 --> 2940.76]  that
[2940.76 --> 2942.34]  my Q6600
[2942.34 --> 2943.60]  my E6600
[2943.60 --> 2945.70]  my 3500 plus
[2945.70 --> 2946.78]  my 3200 plus
[2946.78 --> 2948.00]  my 3000 plus
[2948.00 --> 2948.86]  for those of you
[2948.86 --> 2949.14]  oh yeah
[2949.14 --> 2949.66]  for those of you
[2949.66 --> 2950.10]  who figure I'm
[2950.10 --> 2950.52]  some kind of
[2950.52 --> 2951.40]  Nvidia or Intel
[2951.40 --> 2951.90]  fanboy
[2951.90 --> 2952.68]  yeah that's right
[2952.68 --> 2953.34]  that was
[2953.34 --> 2955.42]  five AMD processors
[2955.42 --> 2955.98]  in a row
[2955.98 --> 2956.84]  I replaced my
[2956.84 --> 2957.68]  4400 plus
[2957.68 --> 2959.12]  with an Optron 165
[2959.12 --> 2960.20]  and that was
[2960.20 --> 2961.38]  finally when I
[2961.38 --> 2962.18]  went Intel after
[2962.18 --> 2962.50]  that
[2962.50 --> 2963.80]  no that's
[2963.80 --> 2964.62]  six in a row
[2964.62 --> 2965.02]  because I had
[2965.02 --> 2965.94]  a 2500 plus
[2965.94 --> 2966.56]  before that
[2966.56 --> 2967.52]  the first three
[2967.52 --> 2968.22]  or four processors
[2968.22 --> 2968.78]  that I either
[2968.78 --> 2969.58]  bought for myself
[2969.58 --> 2970.32]  or specced for
[2970.32 --> 2970.84]  other people in
[2970.84 --> 2971.24]  my family
[2971.24 --> 2971.76]  were all AMD
[2971.76 --> 2972.06]  as well
[2972.06 --> 2973.38]  so out of
[2973.38 --> 2974.08]  all of the chips
[2974.08 --> 2974.48]  that I've ever
[2974.48 --> 2974.66]  bought
[2974.66 --> 2975.66]  the 4400 plus
[2975.66 --> 2976.18]  has got to be
[2976.18 --> 2977.06]  my favorite
[2977.06 --> 2978.02]  okay
[2978.02 --> 2978.52]  have you had
[2978.52 --> 2978.90]  any time to
[2978.90 --> 2979.20]  think about
[2979.20 --> 2979.60]  your favorite
[2979.60 --> 2980.36]  piece of technology
[2980.36 --> 2981.48]  for me
[2981.48 --> 2982.40]  you picked a couple
[2982.40 --> 2983.02]  so for me
[2983.02 --> 2983.58]  I'm going to go
[2983.58 --> 2984.02]  with two
[2984.02 --> 2984.60]  one of them
[2984.60 --> 2985.12]  was my
[2985.12 --> 2986.18]  8800 GTS
[2986.18 --> 2986.58]  how did I
[2986.58 --> 2987.10]  pick a couple
[2987.10 --> 2987.56]  I went with
[2987.56 --> 2988.50]  4400 plus
[2988.50 --> 2989.26]  yeah
[2989.26 --> 2989.78]  you're cheating
[2989.78 --> 2991.94]  really 8800 GTS
[2991.94 --> 2992.34]  you're talking about
[2992.34 --> 2992.64]  SSD
[2992.64 --> 2993.50]  okay go ahead
[2993.50 --> 2993.90]  go ahead
[2993.90 --> 2994.72]  just talk at the
[2994.72 --> 2995.00]  camera
[2995.00 --> 2998.44]  every system I had
[2998.44 --> 2999.06]  before I built
[2999.06 --> 2999.58]  the system that
[2999.58 --> 3000.64]  had the 8800 GTS
[3000.64 --> 3001.04]  in it
[3001.04 --> 3002.50]  was like
[3002.50 --> 3003.60]  just dog slow
[3003.60 --> 3004.32]  in everything that
[3004.32 --> 3004.68]  I did
[3004.68 --> 3006.12]  mainly games
[3006.12 --> 3006.94]  so at this point
[3006.94 --> 3007.34]  in time I was
[3007.34 --> 3007.68]  trying to play
[3007.68 --> 3008.06]  WoW
[3008.06 --> 3008.66]  and I was trying
[3008.66 --> 3009.20]  to tank
[3009.20 --> 3009.68]  at about
[3009.68 --> 3010.74]  1 to 3 FPS
[3010.74 --> 3012.20]  and that was
[3012.20 --> 3012.64]  just
[3012.64 --> 3014.02]  kind of
[3014.02 --> 3014.48]  ridiculous
[3014.48 --> 3015.34]  I would go
[3015.34 --> 3016.00]  in vent
[3016.00 --> 3016.40]  and I'd have
[3016.40 --> 3017.02]  two vent windows
[3017.02 --> 3017.26]  open
[3017.26 --> 3017.58]  and another
[3017.58 --> 3017.96]  one would be
[3017.96 --> 3018.54]  with one of my
[3018.54 --> 3019.04]  friends that was
[3019.04 --> 3019.56]  always in the group
[3019.56 --> 3019.88]  with me
[3019.88 --> 3020.58]  and he would be
[3020.58 --> 3020.94]  like hey
[3020.94 --> 3021.58]  you have to move
[3021.58 --> 3022.22]  in like this
[3022.22 --> 3022.64]  direction
[3022.64 --> 3023.42]  because he knew
[3023.42 --> 3024.20]  I couldn't see it
[3024.20 --> 3024.42]  yet
[3024.42 --> 3025.44]  and then I would
[3025.44 --> 3026.30]  move accordingly
[3026.30 --> 3027.34]  that was
[3027.34 --> 3028.50]  ridiculous
[3028.50 --> 3029.24]  and then once I
[3029.24 --> 3030.26]  got my 8800 GTS
[3030.26 --> 3030.92]  it just crushed
[3030.92 --> 3031.38]  everything
[3031.38 --> 3033.12]  and we still
[3033.12 --> 3034.82]  did like a jokes
[3034.82 --> 3035.52]  benchmark the other
[3035.52 --> 3036.14]  day and it ran
[3036.14 --> 3036.66]  Crysis
[3036.66 --> 3037.70]  or Far Cry 3
[3037.70 --> 3038.88]  which is just
[3038.88 --> 3040.88]  absolutely fantastic
[3040.88 --> 3042.80]  like that's so
[3042.80 --> 3043.24]  cool
[3043.24 --> 3044.28]  it's so cool
[3044.28 --> 3044.76]  and it's still
[3044.76 --> 3045.26]  running today
[3045.26 --> 3045.80]  on some
[3045.80 --> 3046.86]  dude's system
[3046.86 --> 3047.46]  it went from
[3047.46 --> 3048.36]  me to a friend
[3048.36 --> 3049.26]  to another friend
[3049.26 --> 3050.38]  to another guy
[3050.38 --> 3051.10]  and it's still
[3051.10 --> 3051.54]  running
[3051.54 --> 3052.00]  and like
[3052.00 --> 3052.88]  that's just
[3052.88 --> 3053.54]  awesome
[3053.54 --> 3054.42]  G80 was kind
[3054.42 --> 3054.78]  of beast
[3054.78 --> 3055.64]  G80 was a
[3055.64 --> 3056.16]  game changer
[3056.16 --> 3056.74]  like
[3056.74 --> 3057.80]  so cool
[3057.80 --> 3058.38]  and then my
[3058.38 --> 3058.92]  other one
[3058.92 --> 3059.50]  and you're
[3059.50 --> 3060.18]  I had two
[3060.18 --> 3061.46]  G80s
[3061.46 --> 3062.58]  screw you man
[3062.58 --> 3065.76]  my other one
[3065.76 --> 3066.12]  which you're
[3066.12 --> 3066.72]  probably going to
[3066.72 --> 3067.24]  frown at
[3067.24 --> 3068.26]  and revolt over
[3068.26 --> 3069.18]  is
[3069.18 --> 3070.08]  you're
[3070.08 --> 3070.54]  preemptively
[3070.54 --> 3070.86]  fired
[3070.86 --> 3071.38]  but go ahead
[3071.38 --> 3072.48]  and like
[3072.48 --> 3072.72]  I didn't
[3072.72 --> 3073.48]  actually use
[3073.48 --> 3074.08]  it way
[3074.08 --> 3074.58]  too much
[3074.58 --> 3075.10]  but I
[3075.10 --> 3075.74]  enjoyed it
[3075.74 --> 3075.96]  and it
[3075.96 --> 3076.40]  was fun
[3076.40 --> 3076.72]  and I
[3076.72 --> 3077.10]  liked it
[3077.10 --> 3077.24]  really
[3077.24 --> 3077.78]  that stupid
[3077.78 --> 3078.22]  phone
[3078.22 --> 3079.24]  what
[3079.24 --> 3079.96]  oh I thought
[3079.96 --> 3080.14]  you were
[3080.14 --> 3080.36]  going to go
[3080.36 --> 3080.80]  with a phone
[3080.80 --> 3081.70]  okay go ahead
[3081.70 --> 3082.54]  Nexus S
[3082.54 --> 3082.84]  yeah
[3082.84 --> 3083.50]  I love that
[3083.50 --> 3083.84]  phone but
[3083.84 --> 3084.24]  no
[3084.24 --> 3084.92]  okay okay
[3084.92 --> 3085.24]  go ahead
[3085.24 --> 3085.72]  no way
[3085.72 --> 3086.90]  um
[3086.90 --> 3087.66]  I'm trying to
[3087.66 --> 3088.08]  guess things
[3088.08 --> 3088.60]  that like
[3088.60 --> 3089.14]  I would be
[3089.14 --> 3089.68]  bothered by
[3089.68 --> 3089.98]  I'm just
[3089.98 --> 3090.24]  going to keep
[3090.24 --> 3090.68]  talking about
[3090.68 --> 3090.86]  it so you
[3090.86 --> 3091.18]  can hopefully
[3091.18 --> 3091.52]  guess
[3091.52 --> 3092.48]  um
[3092.48 --> 3093.52]  because I
[3093.52 --> 3094.82]  liked with
[3094.82 --> 3095.48]  this release
[3095.48 --> 3096.24]  where I
[3096.24 --> 3096.80]  thought PC
[3096.80 --> 3097.20]  stuff was
[3097.20 --> 3097.52]  going
[3097.52 --> 3099.10]  and now
[3099.10 --> 3099.58]  that Oculus
[3099.58 --> 3100.04]  Rift is
[3100.04 --> 3100.52]  coming out
[3100.52 --> 3101.26]  that should
[3101.26 --> 3102.08]  be a hint
[3102.08 --> 3103.22]  um
[3103.22 --> 3103.74]  I'm even
[3103.74 --> 3104.34]  more excited
[3104.34 --> 3104.82]  and once
[3104.82 --> 3105.62]  they like
[3105.62 --> 3106.22]  right now
[3106.22 --> 3107.08]  the pre-purchases
[3107.08 --> 3107.70]  are for the
[3107.70 --> 3108.38]  developer version
[3108.38 --> 3109.10]  once they
[3109.10 --> 3109.96]  release pre-purchases
[3109.96 --> 3110.58]  for the
[3110.58 --> 3111.36]  consumer version
[3111.36 --> 3111.70]  I'm just
[3111.70 --> 3112.10]  going to jump
[3112.10 --> 3112.86]  right on that
[3112.86 --> 3113.24]  because I'm
[3113.24 --> 3113.78]  super excited
[3113.78 --> 3114.12]  for that
[3114.12 --> 3114.86]  Xbox Connect
[3114.86 --> 3115.44]  nope
[3115.44 --> 3118.08]  what
[3118.08 --> 3120.54]  and he
[3120.54 --> 3120.74]  didn't
[3120.74 --> 3121.28]  technically buy
[3121.28 --> 3121.58]  that I
[3121.58 --> 3121.86]  gave him
[3121.86 --> 3122.18]  one which
[3122.18 --> 3123.92]  he wrecked
[3123.92 --> 3124.46]  wrecked
[3124.46 --> 3125.02]  um
[3125.02 --> 3125.56]  good work
[3125.56 --> 3126.18]  Nia
[3126.18 --> 3127.88]  shut up
[3127.88 --> 3129.90]  okay you're
[3129.90 --> 3130.72]  like double
[3130.72 --> 3131.50]  fired that's
[3131.50 --> 3131.94]  like four
[3131.94 --> 3132.66]  firings already
[3132.66 --> 3133.38]  it was cool
[3133.38 --> 3134.08]  it was fun
[3134.08 --> 3134.40]  and just
[3134.40 --> 3134.86]  because you
[3134.86 --> 3135.38]  can't use
[3135.38 --> 3135.78]  it doesn't
[3135.78 --> 3136.06]  mean that
[3136.06 --> 3136.42]  it sucked
[3136.42 --> 3137.02]  I was able
[3137.02 --> 3137.58]  to use it
[3137.58 --> 3137.98]  you said
[3137.98 --> 3138.24]  you could
[3138.24 --> 3138.64]  barely do
[3138.64 --> 3138.80]  anything
[3138.80 --> 3139.28]  I released
[3139.28 --> 3139.68]  a video
[3139.68 --> 3140.00]  where I
[3140.00 --> 3140.46]  used it
[3140.46 --> 3140.82]  probably
[3140.82 --> 3141.20]  poorly
[3141.20 --> 3142.58]  I used
[3142.58 --> 3142.74]  it
[3142.74 --> 3143.04]  I used
[3143.04 --> 3143.28]  to play
[3143.28 --> 3143.56]  cod
[3143.56 --> 3144.34]  with it
[3144.34 --> 3145.98]  why
[3145.98 --> 3146.86]  because it
[3146.86 --> 3147.30]  was fun
[3147.30 --> 3147.92]  and interesting
[3147.92 --> 3149.78]  it's interesting
[3149.78 --> 3150.26]  to have
[3150.26 --> 3151.34]  poorer control
[3151.34 --> 3151.86]  than it
[3151.86 --> 3152.08]  okay
[3152.08 --> 3152.64]  it actually
[3152.64 --> 3153.36]  wasn't that bad
[3153.36 --> 3155.48]  fine so why are you so down on the peregrine glove then
[3155.48 --> 3156.52]  it's slower
[3156.52 --> 3159.02]  how is it slower than stupid Nia
[3159.02 --> 3160.24]  you're sitting here going
[3160.24 --> 3162.64]  and there's too much change in between fingers
[3162.64 --> 3163.52]  they can't even see your hand
[3163.52 --> 3164.88]  see that shows you how much you know
[3164.88 --> 3166.22]  you don't even know how to lift your hand
[3166.22 --> 3167.78]  the peregrine glove
[3167.78 --> 3169.84]  you have your thumb as an actuator
[3169.84 --> 3171.94]  and then a whole bunch of different touch points along your fingers
[3171.94 --> 3172.88]  so here here and here
[3172.88 --> 3173.72]  your hands are too big
[3173.72 --> 3174.08]  and you have to touch
[3174.08 --> 3177.52]  the distance is smaller
[3177.52 --> 3177.92]  bam
[3177.92 --> 3180.22]  it's still slower than just clicking on a keyboard
[3180.22 --> 3183.70]  but you have access to more potential actuation points
[3183.70 --> 3186.02]  it does something what like 15 commands or something stupid like that
[3186.02 --> 3188.60]  it has access to more actuation points than a keyboard
[3188.60 --> 3189.36]  sorry what
[3189.36 --> 3189.98]  yeah
[3189.98 --> 3193.28]  like within easy reach of say for example people who have small hands
[3193.28 --> 3196.34]  okay well I don't have small hands so I don't care
[3196.34 --> 3198.70]  and maybe it's not comfortable to have your arm up like this on a keyboard
[3198.70 --> 3200.58]  so buy a wristband
[3200.58 --> 3201.54]  okay so really really
[3201.54 --> 3201.94]  or raise your chair
[3201.94 --> 3202.40]  honestly
[3202.40 --> 3204.82]  Nia was faster than a peregrine or a keyboard
[3204.82 --> 3205.48]  yes
[3205.48 --> 3207.10]  not a keyboard
[3207.10 --> 3208.16]  well then why are you
[3208.16 --> 3208.50]  okay
[3208.50 --> 3209.18]  okay
[3209.18 --> 3209.84]  awesome
[3209.84 --> 3210.70]  this is perfect
[3210.70 --> 3211.60]  I love it when he does this
[3211.60 --> 3212.94]  so why are you down on
[3212.94 --> 3213.64]  I've done this like once
[3213.64 --> 3215.14]  why are you down on peregrine
[3215.14 --> 3216.52]  for being slower than a keyboard
[3216.52 --> 3217.38]  if your favorite
[3217.38 --> 3220.18]  if your favorite piece of technology of all time
[3220.18 --> 3221.24]  that's what they asked
[3221.24 --> 3222.06]  I said one of them
[3222.06 --> 3222.94]  one of the two
[3222.94 --> 3226.16]  and I said because I liked where it was pushing the industry
[3226.16 --> 3227.00]  it didn't push anything
[3227.00 --> 3228.50]  and I said I didn't use it that much
[3228.50 --> 3229.46]  wow
[3229.46 --> 3231.92]  you know the Russian has my Nia still
[3231.92 --> 3233.40]  if you'd like I can obtain it
[3233.40 --> 3234.20]  re-obtain it for you
[3234.20 --> 3234.92]  I have mine
[3234.92 --> 3235.76]  you have a Nia
[3235.76 --> 3236.80]  you bought a Nia
[3236.80 --> 3238.24]  we've talked about this before
[3238.24 --> 3238.80]  shut up
[3238.80 --> 3239.52]  on the stream
[3239.52 --> 3241.02]  wow
[3241.02 --> 3242.96]  it was like 60 bucks
[3242.96 --> 3246.56]  that you'll never get back
[3246.56 --> 3248.30]  and I don't want it back
[3248.30 --> 3249.30]  because I enjoyed it
[3249.30 --> 3249.70]  oh
[3249.70 --> 3250.58]  okay
[3250.58 --> 3252.20]  well viewers
[3252.20 --> 3253.62]  I'm really disappointed in you
[3253.62 --> 3254.60]  for asking questions
[3254.60 --> 3255.48]  that make him
[3255.48 --> 3256.02]  sort of
[3256.02 --> 3257.08]  talk about
[3257.08 --> 3257.80]  phenomenally
[3257.80 --> 3259.62]  ridiculous stuff
[3259.62 --> 3261.14]  you think playing games
[3261.14 --> 3261.96]  with a freaking glove
[3261.96 --> 3262.68]  is a good idea
[3262.68 --> 3263.62]  other than power glove
[3263.62 --> 3264.80]  which is amazing
[3264.80 --> 3267.04]  I think peregrine looks alright
[3267.04 --> 3267.74]  I'd try it
[3267.74 --> 3268.40]  looks alright
[3268.40 --> 3269.30]  it had nothing to do
[3269.30 --> 3270.14]  with what it looks like
[3270.14 --> 3270.78]  well it doesn't
[3270.78 --> 3271.80]  I don't mean looks alright
[3271.80 --> 3272.40]  as in like
[3272.40 --> 3272.72]  the
[3272.72 --> 3273.30]  you know
[3273.30 --> 3274.30]  artistic design
[3274.30 --> 3275.98]  I'm gonna press A
[3275.98 --> 3276.98]  and then go over here
[3276.98 --> 3278.48]  and press another macro
[3278.48 --> 3280.56]  and just try to be quick
[3280.56 --> 3282.62]  by doing this
[3282.62 --> 3283.92]  and carpal tunnel
[3283.92 --> 3286.80]  probably better than a keyboard
[3286.80 --> 3287.16]  you know what
[3287.16 --> 3288.34]  I don't want to talk about this anymore
[3288.34 --> 3291.74]  what's your all time favorite motherboard
[3291.74 --> 3294.46]  that's not a bad question either actually
[3294.46 --> 3295.64]  all time favorite motherboard
[3295.64 --> 3300.14]  I don't know
[3300.14 --> 3301.10]  I'm gonna be like
[3301.10 --> 3302.14]  kind of bizarre
[3302.14 --> 3304.94]  and I'm gonna go with the P8P800E Deluxe
[3304.94 --> 3307.82]  he has no idea what I'm talking about
[3307.82 --> 3308.82]  10 points if you even know
[3308.82 --> 3309.72]  what platform that's for
[3309.72 --> 3310.16]  nope
[3310.16 --> 3311.86]  yeah it's a 478 board
[3311.86 --> 3314.06]  that thing was a freaking brick
[3314.06 --> 3315.86]  and I don't mean brick like dead
[3315.86 --> 3316.76]  I was like that's a terrible
[3316.76 --> 3317.66]  okay it was a rock
[3317.66 --> 3318.62]  it was a rock
[3318.62 --> 3320.42]  what's the difference between a rock and a brick anyway
[3320.42 --> 3320.68]  shut up
[3320.68 --> 3321.98]  because brick is used as a term
[3321.98 --> 3323.00]  for things that don't work anymore
[3323.00 --> 3324.56]  and can act as a brick in building something
[3324.56 --> 3326.06]  rock could be used for building something
[3326.06 --> 3326.68]  stone wall
[3326.68 --> 3328.30]  stone wall you
[3328.30 --> 3329.16]  with this argument
[3329.16 --> 3330.04]  bam
[3330.04 --> 3330.64]  what
[3330.64 --> 3331.84]  that's a term
[3331.84 --> 3332.76]  I know
[3332.76 --> 3334.78]  it's just kind of sad
[3334.78 --> 3335.50]  you know what
[3335.50 --> 3336.64]  and I didn't use it much
[3336.64 --> 3338.04]  I actually only used it
[3338.04 --> 3339.96]  for some random suicide runs
[3339.96 --> 3341.08]  on a
[3341.08 --> 3342.40]  what was the stepping
[3342.40 --> 3344.16]  it was an M0 or something
[3344.16 --> 3344.90]  or like
[3344.90 --> 3346.76]  it was some ridiculous stepping
[3346.76 --> 3348.76]  of a P4 2.4C
[3348.76 --> 3349.92]  so it was a Northwood core
[3349.92 --> 3352.08]  that I pulled out of an office machine
[3352.08 --> 3352.74]  that I replaced
[3352.74 --> 3353.46]  and they were just like
[3353.46 --> 3353.84]  yeah whatever
[3353.84 --> 3354.76]  just keep the old computer
[3354.76 --> 3355.18]  I was like
[3355.18 --> 3356.28]  holy crap
[3356.28 --> 3357.40]  do you have any idea what this is
[3357.40 --> 3357.96]  they didn't care
[3357.96 --> 3359.44]  so it was
[3359.44 --> 3359.94]  it was like
[3359.94 --> 3361.28]  a legendary stepping
[3361.28 --> 3362.78]  of the 2.4C
[3362.78 --> 3363.68]  Northwood
[3363.68 --> 3364.66]  and that thing
[3364.66 --> 3366.12]  blew
[3366.12 --> 3368.66]  it did like 3.5 plus gigahertz
[3368.66 --> 3369.44]  or something like that
[3369.44 --> 3370.34]  I think I got it up near
[3370.34 --> 3371.26]  3.5
[3371.26 --> 3371.88]  3.8
[3371.88 --> 3372.76]  somewhere in that range
[3372.76 --> 3374.86]  with some crappy Vantec air cooler
[3374.86 --> 3376.44]  and part of it was that
[3376.44 --> 3378.02]  that board was a beast
[3378.02 --> 3379.20]  it was absolutely solid
[3379.20 --> 3380.94]  follow up to that
[3380.94 --> 3381.62]  would probably be the
[3381.62 --> 3383.24]  A8 N32 SLI Deluxe
[3383.24 --> 3384.50]  that board was so far ahead
[3384.50 --> 3385.04]  of its time
[3385.04 --> 3386.82]  I believe that one was
[3386.82 --> 3388.76]  dual 16x SLI
[3389.36 --> 3390.62]  although I could be wrong
[3390.62 --> 3391.82]  it had heat pipe cooling
[3391.82 --> 3393.06]  it had silent cooling
[3393.06 --> 3394.32]  back then everything had
[3394.32 --> 3395.96]  many annoying fans on them
[3395.96 --> 3399.76]  I've had a number of
[3399.76 --> 3401.12]  I've had a number of good boards
[3401.12 --> 3402.78]  I think those
[3402.78 --> 3404.40]  those two are probably my favorites
[3404.40 --> 3405.62]  do you have a favorite motherboard?
[3406.68 --> 3407.96]  you had an Enforce board
[3407.96 --> 3408.78]  that's probably it right?
[3409.70 --> 3410.04]  no
[3410.04 --> 3411.04]  oh okay
[3411.04 --> 3413.42]  although that Enforce board
[3413.42 --> 3415.52]  got so many really really bad reviews
[3415.52 --> 3418.10]  and then I had no problems with it whatsoever
[3418.10 --> 3418.84]  fair enough
[3418.84 --> 3420.34]  I even wrote a poem about
[3420.34 --> 3421.84]  how bad my experience was with it
[3421.84 --> 3423.82]  I overclocked on it
[3423.82 --> 3425.04]  I ran full dims
[3425.04 --> 3426.08]  which you for some reason
[3426.08 --> 3427.14]  thought was miraculous
[3427.14 --> 3429.44]  I did everything I ever wanted to
[3429.44 --> 3429.90]  on that board
[3429.90 --> 3430.56]  and it didn't have a problem
[3430.56 --> 3431.76]  populating all dims
[3431.76 --> 3433.62]  on an Envidia N46 series board
[3433.62 --> 3434.64]  was like unheard of
[3434.64 --> 3435.44]  had no problem
[3435.44 --> 3437.04]  as someone who tried to build
[3437.04 --> 3438.46]  like quite a number
[3438.46 --> 3439.62]  of high performance systems
[3439.62 --> 3440.30]  on those boards
[3440.30 --> 3441.08]  and those were like
[3441.08 --> 3441.94]  beast dominators
[3441.94 --> 3443.20]  and I was running an extreme edition
[3443.20 --> 3443.78]  that was like
[3443.78 --> 3444.98]  insanely overclocked
[3445.80 --> 3446.56]  what do you think about
[3446.56 --> 3447.46]  running a graphics card
[3447.46 --> 3448.80]  without the plastic shroud on it?
[3448.84 --> 3449.94]  this guy says he's getting
[3449.94 --> 3450.60]  better temperatures
[3450.60 --> 3451.56]  I'd say maybe it works
[3451.56 --> 3452.86]  for some cards
[3452.86 --> 3454.10]  but I wouldn't recommend it
[3454.10 --> 3454.86]  for rear exhaust cards
[3454.86 --> 3456.08]  and some like
[3456.08 --> 3458.44]  specific build situations too
[3458.44 --> 3460.40]  wireless charging stations
[3460.40 --> 3460.84]  in development
[3460.84 --> 3461.40]  that's good
[3461.40 --> 3461.92]  great
[3461.92 --> 3462.96]  I have
[3462.96 --> 3464.20]  I'm sorry man
[3464.20 --> 3465.24]  I don't know what exactly
[3465.24 --> 3466.58]  those models are
[3466.58 --> 3467.54]  but it looks like
[3467.54 --> 3469.32]  two 24 inches
[3469.32 --> 3470.34]  and a 23 inch
[3470.34 --> 3471.08]  should I switch that
[3471.08 --> 3472.72]  for another 24 inch
[3472.72 --> 3474.46]  and if you do do that
[3474.46 --> 3474.94]  then yes
[3474.94 --> 3475.62]  I would switch out
[3475.62 --> 3476.38]  your 7850
[3476.38 --> 3477.24]  for something more powerful
[3477.24 --> 3478.10]  matching models
[3478.10 --> 3478.98]  are nice
[3478.98 --> 3480.04]  yeah it's kind of a nice thing
[3480.04 --> 3481.10]  to have everything look the same
[3481.10 --> 3483.22]  advantages and disadvantages
[3483.22 --> 3484.22]  of SLA and crossfire
[3484.22 --> 3484.52]  you know what
[3484.52 --> 3485.34]  I've probably covered that
[3485.34 --> 3486.36]  a lot of times in the past
[3486.36 --> 3487.62]  I'm going to leave that one off
[3487.62 --> 3489.44]  have you tried the light boost hack
[3489.44 --> 3491.32]  on your 140 40 hertz monitor
[3491.32 --> 3492.26]  I haven't
[3492.26 --> 3494.26]  I don't have a 140 4 hertz monitor
[3494.26 --> 3495.16]  I only got that one
[3495.16 --> 3495.88]  to do an unboxing
[3495.88 --> 3496.68]  and then I was
[3496.68 --> 3498.06]  I was done with it
[3498.06 --> 3498.40]  but
[3498.40 --> 3499.48]  what I will do
[3499.48 --> 3500.90]  is I will email that tweet
[3500.90 --> 3501.68]  to
[3501.68 --> 3503.00]  to myself
[3503.00 --> 3504.08]  and then
[3504.08 --> 3504.60]  we will
[3504.60 --> 3505.32]  we will go ahead
[3505.32 --> 3506.14]  and check that out
[3506.14 --> 3507.66]  here
[3507.66 --> 3508.78]  I have more topics
[3508.78 --> 3509.40]  so PS3
[3509.40 --> 3509.70]  have you
[3509.70 --> 3510.28]  have you checked out
[3510.28 --> 3510.96]  the PS3 specs
[3510.96 --> 3511.76]  and all that
[3511.76 --> 3513.26]  PS4
[3513.26 --> 3514.16]  yeah that one
[3514.16 --> 3515.04]  who cares
[3515.04 --> 3515.84]  it doesn't matter anyway
[3515.84 --> 3516.78]  since the initial leak
[3516.78 --> 3517.42]  have they changed
[3517.42 --> 3518.76]  like a while back
[3518.76 --> 3519.60]  there's official specs
[3519.60 --> 3520.02]  yeah
[3520.02 --> 3520.32]  yeah
[3520.32 --> 3521.38]  there's official specs
[3521.38 --> 3521.98]  what do you live under
[3521.98 --> 3522.74]  a brick
[3522.74 --> 3524.62]  well for the last week
[3524.62 --> 3525.56]  I've worked almost
[3525.56 --> 3526.30]  the entire day
[3526.30 --> 3527.10]  working on Titan
[3527.10 --> 3529.40]  screw you
[3529.40 --> 3532.24]  the only two news topics
[3532.24 --> 3533.08]  I have for this week
[3533.08 --> 3534.12]  are from this morning
[3534.12 --> 3535.50]  when I was prepping
[3535.50 --> 3536.30]  Netlinked Weekly
[3536.30 --> 3537.50]  because I have not
[3537.50 --> 3538.60]  been online at all
[3538.60 --> 3539.54]  forum mods
[3539.54 --> 3540.30]  if you're watching
[3540.30 --> 3540.70]  hello
[3540.70 --> 3541.72]  I'm sorry I haven't
[3541.72 --> 3542.50]  been on for a week
[3542.50 --> 3543.82]  I've literally been
[3543.82 --> 3544.54]  sitting here
[3544.54 --> 3545.50]  benchmarking Titan
[3545.50 --> 3547.24]  for the entirety
[3547.24 --> 3547.82]  of the week
[3547.82 --> 3549.62]  ugh
[3549.62 --> 3552.72]  won't block used games
[3552.72 --> 3554.66]  yeah okay
[3554.66 --> 3555.98]  so let's talk about
[3555.98 --> 3556.50]  this very quickly
[3556.50 --> 3557.64]  I don't know the specs
[3557.64 --> 3558.46]  but awesome
[3558.46 --> 3558.72]  someone says
[3558.72 --> 3559.48]  stick to computers
[3559.48 --> 3559.98]  my friend
[3559.98 --> 3560.68]  cars are a whole
[3560.68 --> 3561.32]  different thing
[3561.32 --> 3562.34]  I think that is
[3562.34 --> 3563.92]  probably the most
[3563.92 --> 3565.62]  insightful statement
[3565.62 --> 3566.28]  that I have ever
[3566.28 --> 3566.72]  heard ever
[3566.72 --> 3567.40]  very astute
[3567.40 --> 3568.48]  way to go Jeremy
[3568.48 --> 3569.88]  you are the man
[3569.88 --> 3571.26]  indeed cars are
[3571.26 --> 3571.70]  a whole different
[3571.70 --> 3572.58]  thing from computers
[3572.58 --> 3573.90]  although we're gonna
[3573.90 --> 3574.78]  see more integration
[3574.78 --> 3575.46]  moving forward
[3575.46 --> 3576.84]  than maybe you
[3576.84 --> 3577.50]  would think
[3577.50 --> 3578.40]  is possible
[3578.40 --> 3579.28]  for example
[3579.28 --> 3580.26]  cars may not run
[3580.26 --> 3581.26]  on gasoline in the future
[3581.26 --> 3581.90]  which would make them
[3581.90 --> 3582.64]  more like computers
[3582.64 --> 3583.56]  for example
[3583.56 --> 3584.38]  cars are gonna be
[3584.38 --> 3585.50]  chock full of features
[3585.50 --> 3586.22]  like GPS
[3586.22 --> 3587.48]  and MP3 players
[3587.48 --> 3590.08]  and email capability
[3590.08 --> 3591.20]  and SMS texting
[3591.20 --> 3592.08]  which actually makes them
[3592.08 --> 3593.12]  closer to phones
[3593.12 --> 3593.68]  and computers
[3593.68 --> 3595.06]  than you might actually
[3595.06 --> 3595.30]  think
[3595.30 --> 3596.54]  so who knows
[3596.54 --> 3598.00]  cars may be the domain
[3598.00 --> 3598.90]  of Linus Tech Tips
[3598.90 --> 3599.98]  not that long from now
[3599.98 --> 3600.92]  maybe at some point
[3600.92 --> 3602.06]  we'll be overclocking cars
[3602.06 --> 3602.38]  yeah
[3602.38 --> 3604.04]  maybe we'll be overclocking cars
[3604.04 --> 3604.64]  that would actually
[3604.64 --> 3605.26]  be kind of cool
[3605.26 --> 3606.06]  I mean
[3606.06 --> 3607.02]  you know what
[3607.02 --> 3607.96]  you could probably
[3607.96 --> 3609.00]  overclock a car
[3609.00 --> 3610.00]  as simply as putting
[3610.00 --> 3611.18]  a beefier battery in it
[3611.18 --> 3612.12]  and throwing a beefier
[3612.12 --> 3613.36]  electric motor in it
[3613.36 --> 3614.02]  I can't wait
[3614.02 --> 3615.08]  till there's some gearhead
[3615.08 --> 3615.48]  that's like
[3615.48 --> 3616.48]  yeah I'm gonna overclock
[3616.48 --> 3619.10]  my GT 780 Hemi
[3619.10 --> 3620.88]  yeah
[3620.88 --> 3622.58]  that'd be sweet
[3622.58 --> 3623.46]  I mean
[3623.46 --> 3623.96]  you know what
[3623.96 --> 3625.02]  and the kind of processing
[3625.02 --> 3625.76]  that's gonna go on
[3625.76 --> 3626.16]  in a car
[3626.16 --> 3627.18]  to make it self-driving
[3627.18 --> 3628.10]  would actually make it
[3628.10 --> 3629.28]  more computer than car
[3629.28 --> 3630.68]  I would make that argument
[3630.68 --> 3632.44]  once it's electric
[3632.44 --> 3633.68]  and it's self-driving
[3633.68 --> 3634.02]  yes
[3634.02 --> 3635.52]  then what's actually left
[3635.52 --> 3636.28]  to call it a car
[3636.28 --> 3637.12]  it's basically a computer
[3637.12 --> 3637.62]  on wheels
[3637.62 --> 3639.00]  beast
[3639.00 --> 3639.70]  bam
[3639.70 --> 3640.38]  bam
[3640.38 --> 3640.76]  bam
[3640.76 --> 3641.88]  Jeremy just got told
[3641.88 --> 3642.80]  minus car tips
[3642.80 --> 3643.16]  yeah
[3643.16 --> 3644.06]  minus car tips
[3644.06 --> 3644.38]  hardcore
[3644.38 --> 3645.46]  I've actually already
[3645.46 --> 3646.26]  reserved that channel
[3646.26 --> 3647.02]  minus car tips
[3647.02 --> 3647.58]  2016
[3647.58 --> 3648.38]  yeah
[3648.38 --> 3648.88]  yeah
[3648.88 --> 3649.38]  yeah
[3649.38 --> 3649.94]  yeah
[3649.94 --> 3650.86]  yeah
[3650.86 --> 3652.76]  alright
[3652.76 --> 3653.20]  let's talk
[3653.20 --> 3653.88]  PlayStation 4
[3653.88 --> 3655.30]  so PlayStation 4
[3655.30 --> 3656.08]  is gonna have
[3656.08 --> 3656.90]  okay
[3656.90 --> 3657.74]  first of all
[3657.74 --> 3658.42]  okay we're gonna go
[3658.42 --> 3659.02]  kind of in order
[3659.02 --> 3660.00]  so the CPU
[3660.00 --> 3661.66]  is an x86-64
[3661.66 --> 3662.38]  AMD
[3662.38 --> 3663.60]  Jaguar
[3663.60 --> 3664.62]  8 core CPU
[3664.62 --> 3665.82]  so a couple of things
[3665.82 --> 3668.10]  so people seem to be
[3668.10 --> 3669.14]  really excited
[3669.14 --> 3670.34]  about how games
[3670.34 --> 3670.92]  are gonna be more
[3670.92 --> 3671.96]  multi-threaded now
[3671.96 --> 3673.14]  because it's got a
[3673.14 --> 3674.00]  multi-core CPU
[3674.00 --> 3674.68]  and an x-generation
[3674.68 --> 3674.98]  console
[3674.98 --> 3675.54]  you know what
[3675.54 --> 3677.08]  the last generation
[3677.08 --> 3677.92]  consoles had
[3677.92 --> 3679.26]  multi-core CPUs too
[3679.26 --> 3680.46]  okay
[3680.46 --> 3681.54]  Xbox's processor
[3681.54 --> 3682.48]  is triple core
[3682.48 --> 3683.90]  Cell is what
[3683.90 --> 3684.42]  5 core
[3684.42 --> 3685.00]  or something stupid
[3685.00 --> 3685.34]  like that
[3685.34 --> 3686.32]  I think it's a 5 core
[3686.32 --> 3687.52]  we didn't get better
[3687.52 --> 3688.46]  multi-threading support
[3688.46 --> 3689.44]  except Crysis 3
[3689.44 --> 3690.06]  which is
[3690.06 --> 3691.18]  like
[3691.18 --> 3692.44]  released now
[3692.44 --> 3693.98]  when like
[3693.98 --> 3694.60]  those consoles
[3694.60 --> 3695.30]  are going away
[3695.30 --> 3696.50]  so I don't know
[3696.50 --> 3696.82]  I don't know
[3696.82 --> 3697.46]  where this idea
[3697.46 --> 3697.96]  comes from
[3697.96 --> 3699.36]  one thing I am happy
[3699.36 --> 3699.90]  to see though
[3699.90 --> 3701.22]  is x86 compatibility
[3701.22 --> 3701.96]  because it means
[3701.96 --> 3702.62]  the flexibility
[3702.62 --> 3703.88]  of that operating system
[3703.88 --> 3705.40]  for not necessarily
[3705.40 --> 3705.96]  the flexibility
[3705.96 --> 3706.82]  for Sony
[3706.82 --> 3707.60]  because who cares
[3707.60 --> 3708.30]  about their flexibility
[3708.30 --> 3708.82]  they could do
[3708.82 --> 3709.30]  whatever they wanted
[3709.30 --> 3709.62]  with it
[3709.62 --> 3710.46]  but the flexibility
[3710.46 --> 3711.58]  for guys like
[3711.58 --> 3712.64]  hackers and coders
[3712.64 --> 3713.42]  who want to get in there
[3713.42 --> 3714.22]  and tinker with it
[3714.22 --> 3715.96]  that's pretty exciting
[3715.96 --> 3716.44]  to me
[3716.44 --> 3718.20]  also the ability
[3718.20 --> 3719.64]  to potentially have
[3719.64 --> 3721.36]  easier cross-platform
[3721.36 --> 3721.86]  development
[3721.86 --> 3722.74]  for things that are
[3722.74 --> 3723.24]  going to run on
[3723.24 --> 3723.78]  PS4
[3723.78 --> 3724.30]  computer
[3724.30 --> 3726.80]  intel-powered phones
[3726.80 --> 3727.76]  tablets
[3727.76 --> 3728.92]  maybe this has
[3728.92 --> 3729.68]  something to do
[3729.68 --> 3731.22]  with Bungie's project
[3731.22 --> 3733.48]  that they're just
[3733.48 --> 3734.56]  not really talking about
[3734.56 --> 3735.46]  oh what is it called
[3735.46 --> 3735.76]  again
[3735.76 --> 3737.16]  I'm not going to
[3737.16 --> 3737.60]  remember the name
[3737.60 --> 3738.72]  but it's fairly hush-hush
[3738.72 --> 3739.10]  right now
[3739.10 --> 3741.04]  as far as I've heard
[3741.04 --> 3741.86]  they just released
[3741.86 --> 3742.36]  a like
[3742.36 --> 3744.38]  two and a half minute
[3744.38 --> 3745.32]  kind of big teaser
[3745.32 --> 3745.94]  trailer thing
[3745.94 --> 3746.96]  so maybe there's more
[3746.96 --> 3747.68]  information out there
[3747.68 --> 3748.12]  about it now
[3748.12 --> 3749.08]  but Bungie has this
[3749.08 --> 3749.90]  huge project
[3749.90 --> 3750.48]  because you know
[3750.48 --> 3750.96]  they bumped
[3750.96 --> 3751.86]  Halo 4
[3751.86 --> 3752.72]  to another developer
[3752.72 --> 3754.88]  and then Bungie
[3754.88 --> 3755.24]  was like
[3755.24 --> 3755.50]  nope
[3755.50 --> 3756.04]  we're developing
[3756.04 --> 3757.48]  we're focusing
[3757.48 --> 3758.70]  our entire company
[3758.70 --> 3760.06]  on this huge
[3760.06 --> 3761.00]  new project
[3761.00 --> 3763.20]  and they keep
[3763.20 --> 3763.72]  on bringing this
[3763.72 --> 3764.20]  thing about how
[3764.20 --> 3764.82]  it's going to unfold
[3764.82 --> 3765.82]  over 10 years
[3765.82 --> 3766.94]  and like
[3766.94 --> 3768.18]  all this crazy
[3768.18 --> 3769.00]  sounds like a console
[3769.00 --> 3769.66]  project then
[3769.66 --> 3770.66]  because PS4
[3770.66 --> 3771.46]  if it doesn't last
[3771.46 --> 3771.94]  10 years
[3771.94 --> 3772.94]  I'll be very surprised
[3772.94 --> 3773.68]  yeah
[3773.68 --> 3774.56]  like so
[3774.56 --> 3775.70]  looking at how
[3775.70 --> 3776.88]  the life cycles
[3776.88 --> 3778.24]  of these consoles
[3778.24 --> 3778.86]  keep extending
[3778.86 --> 3779.38]  just getting bigger
[3779.38 --> 3779.68]  and bigger
[3779.68 --> 3780.00]  yeah
[3780.00 --> 3781.26]  okay
[3781.26 --> 3781.80]  so
[3781.80 --> 3782.60]  okay
[3782.60 --> 3783.02]  there you go
[3783.02 --> 3783.54]  the GPU
[3783.54 --> 3783.84]  will be
[3783.84 --> 3785.34]  1.84 teraflops
[3785.34 --> 3785.82]  AMD
[3785.82 --> 3786.86]  next generation
[3786.86 --> 3787.52]  Radeon based
[3787.52 --> 3788.22]  graphics engine
[3788.22 --> 3789.68]  so this sounds
[3789.68 --> 3790.30]  an awful lot
[3790.30 --> 3790.66]  to me
[3790.66 --> 3791.06]  like
[3791.06 --> 3792.26]  probably somewhere
[3792.26 --> 3793.00]  in the neighborhood
[3793.00 --> 3794.40]  of a GTX 660
[3794.40 --> 3795.20]  in terms of power
[3795.20 --> 3796.24]  like a 7850
[3796.24 --> 3797.84]  7870
[3797.84 --> 3798.78]  it's cool that
[3798.78 --> 3799.44]  consoles are getting
[3799.44 --> 3800.44]  over a teraflop
[3800.44 --> 3801.34]  when not way
[3801.34 --> 3802.04]  too long ago
[3802.04 --> 3802.58]  we were talking
[3802.58 --> 3803.22]  about the teraflop
[3803.22 --> 3803.56]  barrier
[3803.56 --> 3804.18]  however
[3804.18 --> 3805.54]  just to be clear
[3805.54 --> 3806.10]  you know
[3806.10 --> 3806.98]  teraflop barrier
[3806.98 --> 3808.44]  has been in the
[3808.44 --> 3808.96]  rearview mirror
[3808.96 --> 3809.68]  for a little while
[3809.68 --> 3809.92]  now
[3809.92 --> 3810.66]  this card is a
[3810.66 --> 3812.36]  4.5 teraflop card
[3812.36 --> 3814.24]  so for those
[3814.24 --> 3815.34]  for those posting
[3815.34 --> 3816.20]  on videos on
[3816.20 --> 3816.46]  YouTube
[3816.46 --> 3817.06]  there seems to be
[3817.06 --> 3817.56]  an awful lot of
[3817.56 --> 3818.14]  people doing this
[3818.14 --> 3819.08]  that PlayStation 4
[3819.08 --> 3819.98]  is going to
[3819.98 --> 3821.04]  revolutionize
[3821.04 --> 3821.80]  HD graphics
[3821.80 --> 3822.52]  and leave the
[3822.52 --> 3823.94]  PC in the dust
[3823.94 --> 3825.14]  and blah blah blah
[3825.14 --> 3825.96]  no it isn't
[3825.96 --> 3826.88]  that won't happen
[3826.88 --> 3827.76]  although it's way
[3827.76 --> 3828.40]  easier for game
[3828.40 --> 3829.00]  developers to
[3829.00 --> 3829.62]  optimize things
[3829.62 --> 3830.06]  for a system
[3830.06 --> 3830.90]  that doesn't change
[3830.90 --> 3832.34]  so graphics
[3832.34 --> 3833.34]  will look a lot
[3833.34 --> 3835.16]  better in relation
[3835.16 --> 3835.78]  yeah it'll look
[3835.78 --> 3836.06]  alright
[3836.06 --> 3836.66]  and apparently
[3836.66 --> 3836.98]  it's going to
[3836.98 --> 3837.56]  have 8 gigs
[3837.56 --> 3838.36]  of DDDR5
[3838.36 --> 3840.16]  so that to me
[3840.16 --> 3841.16]  sounds potentially
[3841.16 --> 3841.92]  4K ready
[3841.92 --> 3844.20]  so the graphics
[3844.20 --> 3844.96]  might actually
[3844.96 --> 3845.72]  not look that much
[3845.72 --> 3846.24]  better in terms
[3846.24 --> 3846.66]  of how many
[3846.66 --> 3847.14]  triangles
[3847.14 --> 3848.22]  and in terms
[3848.22 --> 3848.88]  of the pixel
[3848.88 --> 3849.70]  processing power
[3849.70 --> 3850.44]  but textures
[3850.44 --> 3851.74]  will be
[3851.74 --> 3852.76]  possible
[3852.76 --> 3853.66]  to be loaded
[3853.66 --> 3854.38]  into the memory
[3854.38 --> 3855.28]  to even run
[3855.28 --> 3857.14]  at greater than
[3857.14 --> 3857.86]  HD resolution
[3857.86 --> 3858.46]  so that's pretty
[3858.46 --> 3859.20]  exciting as well
[3859.20 --> 3860.26]  it's still
[3860.26 --> 3860.56]  going to have
[3860.56 --> 3861.08]  a hard disk
[3861.08 --> 3861.80]  and I've seen
[3861.80 --> 3862.48]  some comments
[3862.48 --> 3863.02]  that people
[3863.02 --> 3863.78]  were disappointed
[3863.78 --> 3864.26]  that it didn't
[3864.26 --> 3864.88]  have an SSD
[3864.88 --> 3865.36]  but
[3865.36 --> 3867.00]  I load all my
[3867.00 --> 3867.56]  games onto a
[3867.56 --> 3867.94]  hard disk
[3867.94 --> 3868.96]  and we had
[3868.96 --> 3869.48]  this discussion
[3869.48 --> 3870.16]  actually earlier
[3870.16 --> 3870.82]  on this live stream
[3870.82 --> 3871.70]  completely by accident
[3871.70 --> 3872.78]  an SSD contributes
[3872.78 --> 3873.92]  nothing to your
[3873.92 --> 3874.70]  gaming performance
[3874.70 --> 3875.38]  so
[3875.38 --> 3876.04]  game load
[3876.04 --> 3876.70]  sits in RAM
[3876.70 --> 3877.76]  game load
[3877.76 --> 3878.56]  sits in RAM
[3878.56 --> 3880.98]  it's not like
[3880.98 --> 3881.70]  the console needs
[3881.70 --> 3882.12]  to be moved
[3882.12 --> 3883.00]  around a whole lot
[3883.00 --> 3883.56]  unless you're
[3883.56 --> 3884.12]  sort of a
[3884.12 --> 3885.50]  hardcore LAN
[3885.50 --> 3886.20]  gamer with your
[3886.20 --> 3886.70]  console
[3886.70 --> 3888.12]  like once
[3888.12 --> 3888.60]  the hard drive
[3888.60 --> 3889.14]  parts
[3889.14 --> 3889.90]  yeah
[3889.90 --> 3890.58]  you're probably
[3890.58 --> 3891.00]  fine
[3891.00 --> 3891.40]  it's probably
[3891.40 --> 3891.96]  fine
[3891.96 --> 3893.84]  yeah
[3893.84 --> 3894.30]  read only
[3894.30 --> 3894.94]  optical drive
[3894.94 --> 3895.50]  that sort of
[3895.50 --> 3895.92]  figures
[3895.92 --> 3896.70]  blu-ray
[3896.70 --> 3897.42]  again
[3897.42 --> 3898.12]  super speed
[3898.12 --> 3898.82]  USB 3
[3898.82 --> 3899.36]  great
[3899.36 --> 3900.40]  gigabit
[3900.40 --> 3901.36]  ethernet
[3901.36 --> 3903.46]  802.11n
[3903.46 --> 3903.96]  wireless
[3903.96 --> 3904.58]  that's a little
[3904.58 --> 3905.14]  bit disappointing
[3905.14 --> 3905.90]  especially given
[3905.90 --> 3907.04]  how we've seen
[3907.04 --> 3908.20]  AC outperforms
[3908.20 --> 3908.40]  N
[3908.40 --> 3909.48]  but AC is so
[3909.48 --> 3910.34]  expensive right now
[3910.34 --> 3910.98]  and they'll probably
[3910.98 --> 3912.34]  have dongles
[3912.34 --> 3912.96]  considering they have
[3912.96 --> 3913.74]  USB 3 points
[3913.74 --> 3914.36]  yeah and I think
[3914.36 --> 3914.84]  they're targeting
[3914.84 --> 3915.42]  I think it was
[3915.42 --> 3916.12]  $450
[3916.12 --> 3917.54]  for the price
[3917.54 --> 3917.86]  wow
[3917.86 --> 3918.92]  very aggressive
[3918.92 --> 3919.66]  although that could
[3919.66 --> 3920.30]  end up being
[3920.30 --> 3921.04]  completely revised
[3921.04 --> 3921.50]  or that rumor
[3921.50 --> 3922.00]  could be completely
[3922.00 --> 3922.24]  wrong
[3922.24 --> 3923.06]  wasn't PS3
[3923.06 --> 3923.76]  like a grand
[3923.76 --> 3925.20]  no I think it was
[3925.20 --> 3926.08]  $599 or something
[3926.08 --> 3926.40]  like that
[3926.40 --> 3927.62]  but like not to buy
[3927.62 --> 3928.90]  not to buy the like
[3928.90 --> 3929.82]  super terrible
[3929.82 --> 3930.54]  core edition
[3930.54 --> 3931.78]  like to actually get
[3931.78 --> 3932.40]  a good system
[3932.40 --> 3932.98]  well no the early
[3932.98 --> 3933.96]  PS3s none of them
[3933.96 --> 3934.34]  were bad
[3934.34 --> 3934.74]  they all had
[3934.74 --> 3935.54]  backwards compatibility
[3935.54 --> 3936.24]  for example
[3936.24 --> 3937.26]  okay I know with
[3937.26 --> 3938.46]  Xbox they had
[3938.46 --> 3940.38]  the core edition
[3940.38 --> 3941.56]  yes Xbox had
[3941.56 --> 3942.04]  core edition
[3942.04 --> 3942.72]  yeah and if you
[3942.72 --> 3943.36]  bought the core edition
[3943.36 --> 3943.80]  it was like
[3943.80 --> 3944.50]  it didn't have a
[3944.50 --> 3945.04]  hard drive
[3945.04 --> 3945.78]  didn't have a
[3945.78 --> 3946.62]  hard drive
[3946.62 --> 3948.32]  which made it fail
[3948.32 --> 3948.74]  basically
[3948.74 --> 3949.58]  you couldn't play
[3949.58 --> 3950.14]  a whole bunch of
[3950.14 --> 3950.66]  games on it
[3950.66 --> 3951.14]  but the good news
[3951.14 --> 3952.10]  is it probably died
[3952.10 --> 3952.72]  and got replaced
[3952.72 --> 3953.32]  with a hard drive
[3953.32 --> 3953.84]  model later
[3953.84 --> 3958.60]  that was the strategy
[3958.60 --> 3959.58]  all along
[3959.58 --> 3963.86]  HDMI output of course
[3963.86 --> 3965.44]  analog output still
[3965.44 --> 3966.84]  which is I mean
[3966.84 --> 3967.72]  probably necessary
[3967.72 --> 3968.40]  because not every
[3968.40 --> 3970.08]  I mean North America
[3970.08 --> 3970.96]  is you know fine
[3970.96 --> 3971.46]  and interesting
[3971.46 --> 3972.96]  with HDTVs costing
[3972.96 --> 3973.92]  you know $699
[3973.92 --> 3974.64]  $599
[3974.64 --> 3976.22]  but there's lots
[3976.22 --> 3976.70]  of territories
[3976.70 --> 3977.28]  where lots of people
[3977.28 --> 3977.76]  are still running
[3977.76 --> 3978.02]  analog
[3978.02 --> 3979.22]  so apparently
[3979.22 --> 3980.00]  it's coming this year
[3980.00 --> 3980.62]  they're not going to
[3980.62 --> 3981.48]  block used games
[3981.48 --> 3982.26]  and I think that's
[3982.26 --> 3982.76]  pretty much all we
[3982.76 --> 3983.36]  have to say about it
[3983.36 --> 3984.04]  isn't it like April
[3984.04 --> 3984.46]  or something
[3984.46 --> 3985.08]  you know what
[3985.08 --> 3986.24]  when PS4 comes out
[3986.24 --> 3987.50]  we should do like
[3987.50 --> 3988.38]  like a marathon
[3988.38 --> 3989.34]  live stream
[3989.34 --> 3990.90]  of not lining up
[3990.90 --> 3991.54]  for PS4
[3991.54 --> 3992.40]  and all of the
[3992.40 --> 3992.86]  better things
[3992.86 --> 3993.30]  that we're doing
[3993.30 --> 3993.70]  instead
[3993.70 --> 3995.24]  oh my god
[3995.24 --> 3996.28]  yeah
[3996.28 --> 3996.90]  that would actually
[3996.90 --> 3997.66]  be kind of amazing
[3997.66 --> 3998.40]  so as soon as
[3998.40 --> 4000.04]  as soon as we hear
[4000.04 --> 4001.06]  about a PlayStation 4
[4001.06 --> 4001.40]  lineup
[4001.40 --> 4002.12]  we should just go
[4002.12 --> 4002.58]  do something
[4002.58 --> 4003.56]  that's way more fun
[4003.56 --> 4005.62]  and just stream it
[4005.62 --> 4006.90]  like play PC games
[4006.90 --> 4007.56]  yeah
[4007.56 --> 4009.38]  we should go
[4009.38 --> 4010.12]  to
[4010.12 --> 4011.52]  the PlayStation 4
[4011.52 --> 4011.88]  lineup
[4011.88 --> 4012.66]  with like
[4012.66 --> 4014.20]  a truck or something
[4014.20 --> 4014.68]  yeah
[4014.68 --> 4015.50]  and power our
[4015.50 --> 4016.20]  computers off it
[4016.20 --> 4017.08]  and have a PC LAN
[4017.08 --> 4017.88]  in the very front
[4017.88 --> 4018.62]  of the PS4
[4018.62 --> 4018.64]  lineup
[4018.64 --> 4018.94]  we should just
[4018.94 --> 4019.62]  have a LAN
[4019.62 --> 4020.58]  at a PS4
[4020.58 --> 4020.84]  lineup
[4020.84 --> 4021.12]  yeah
[4021.12 --> 4022.14]  and we'll be like
[4022.14 --> 4022.60]  yeah you know
[4022.60 --> 4023.22]  those graphics
[4023.22 --> 4023.90]  that you're waiting
[4023.90 --> 4024.82]  for so that you
[4024.82 --> 4025.12]  can go
[4025.12 --> 4025.78]  we have to play
[4025.78 --> 4026.30]  games that are
[4026.30 --> 4026.68]  going to be
[4026.68 --> 4028.08]  like launch titles
[4028.08 --> 4028.62]  if they're on
[4028.62 --> 4029.20]  PC already
[4029.20 --> 4030.08]  I really doubt it
[4030.08 --> 4030.70]  probably not
[4030.70 --> 4031.40]  probably because
[4031.40 --> 4031.80]  there won't be
[4031.80 --> 4032.66]  any launch titles
[4032.66 --> 4034.06]  woo
[4034.06 --> 4035.18]  wow
[4035.18 --> 4038.26]  if it's anything
[4038.26 --> 4039.08]  like PS3
[4039.08 --> 4040.44]  I think
[4040.44 --> 4041.54]  I think Watch Dogs
[4041.54 --> 4042.46]  is going to be
[4042.46 --> 4042.82]  a launch title
[4042.82 --> 4043.36]  which is actually
[4043.36 --> 4043.90]  pretty cool
[4043.90 --> 4044.72]  okay whatever
[4044.72 --> 4045.86]  but yeah
[4045.86 --> 4046.44]  I understand
[4046.44 --> 4046.76]  what you're saying
[4046.76 --> 4047.36]  oh maybe they'll
[4047.36 --> 4047.74]  have another
[4047.74 --> 4048.34]  Final Fantasy
[4048.34 --> 4048.92]  where you run
[4048.92 --> 4049.48]  down a corridor
[4049.48 --> 4052.90]  I miss good
[4052.90 --> 4053.56]  Final Fantasy
[4053.56 --> 4055.10]  games so much
[4055.10 --> 4056.26]  they were so
[4056.26 --> 4056.88]  good
[4056.88 --> 4057.76]  they were so
[4057.76 --> 4058.98]  consistently awesome
[4058.98 --> 4059.56]  I tried
[4059.56 --> 4061.66]  5, 6, and 7
[4061.66 --> 4063.04]  were so good
[4063.04 --> 4065.44]  I gotta go back
[4065.44 --> 4066.00]  and play some
[4066.00 --> 4067.12]  I tried 13
[4067.12 --> 4067.52]  did I tell you
[4067.52 --> 4067.88]  about that
[4067.88 --> 4068.26]  oh
[4068.26 --> 4069.64]  why
[4069.64 --> 4070.94]  why even bother
[4070.94 --> 4071.98]  I had it
[4071.98 --> 4072.78]  like a friend
[4072.78 --> 4073.24]  of mine came
[4073.24 --> 4073.84]  over and he
[4073.84 --> 4074.62]  left and kind
[4074.62 --> 4075.14]  of left it at
[4075.14 --> 4075.56]  my house
[4075.56 --> 4076.42]  so I was like
[4076.42 --> 4077.68]  I'm gonna try
[4077.68 --> 4078.10]  13
[4078.10 --> 4079.06]  which console
[4079.06 --> 4079.90]  is 13 for
[4079.90 --> 4080.50]  that's the
[4080.50 --> 4081.68]  okay yeah
[4081.68 --> 4083.02]  and the most
[4083.02 --> 4083.66]  fascinating thing
[4083.66 --> 4084.34]  about it was
[4084.34 --> 4085.08]  there was always
[4085.08 --> 4085.86]  this little button
[4085.86 --> 4086.62]  like kind of
[4086.62 --> 4087.22]  peeking out from
[4087.22 --> 4087.62]  the corner
[4087.62 --> 4088.16]  that I just
[4088.16 --> 4088.72]  kind of ignored
[4088.72 --> 4089.42]  which was like
[4089.42 --> 4090.18]  the I don't
[4090.18 --> 4090.56]  remember what
[4090.56 --> 4091.16]  it actually was
[4091.16 --> 4091.60]  but it's just
[4091.60 --> 4092.04]  basically like
[4092.04 --> 4093.00]  the autoplay button
[4093.00 --> 4094.62]  and at some
[4094.62 --> 4095.08]  point I'm like
[4095.08 --> 4096.04]  just what is
[4096.04 --> 4096.46]  this like
[4096.46 --> 4096.82]  because I'm
[4096.82 --> 4097.28]  going through
[4097.28 --> 4097.78]  and scraping my
[4097.78 --> 4098.36]  battles and I'm
[4098.36 --> 4098.76]  doing pretty
[4098.76 --> 4099.52]  alright and I
[4099.52 --> 4099.94]  clicked that
[4099.94 --> 4100.34]  and I'm like
[4100.34 --> 4101.56]  wow
[4101.56 --> 4102.62]  it kind of like
[4102.62 --> 4103.16]  did all the
[4103.16 --> 4103.96]  right stuff
[4103.96 --> 4105.76]  like really
[4105.76 --> 4106.68]  like what is
[4106.68 --> 4107.14]  this so I
[4107.14 --> 4107.60]  just kept on
[4107.60 --> 4109.08]  like wait
[4109.08 --> 4109.70]  wait this
[4109.70 --> 4110.66]  literally plays
[4110.66 --> 4111.20]  the game for
[4111.20 --> 4112.22]  me it turned
[4112.22 --> 4112.96]  into this like
[4112.96 --> 4113.74]  big rolling
[4113.74 --> 4114.56]  cinematic with
[4114.56 --> 4115.08]  me pressing
[4115.08 --> 4115.90]  buttons like
[4115.90 --> 4116.58]  derped out on
[4116.58 --> 4116.98]  the couch
[4116.98 --> 4117.76]  I mean even
[4117.76 --> 4118.72]  the even the
[4118.72 --> 4119.56]  most strategy
[4119.56 --> 4120.44]  heavy Final
[4120.44 --> 4121.22]  Fantasy games
[4121.22 --> 4121.74]  like some of
[4121.74 --> 4122.14]  the earlier
[4122.14 --> 4122.66]  ones where you
[4122.66 --> 4123.34]  actually had
[4123.34 --> 4123.80]  like you were
[4123.80 --> 4124.64]  in random
[4124.64 --> 4125.48]  encounters you
[4125.48 --> 4126.18]  might actually
[4126.18 --> 4126.92]  die yeah
[4126.92 --> 4127.72]  even some of
[4127.72 --> 4128.30]  those ones
[4128.30 --> 4128.76]  like there
[4128.76 --> 4129.14]  was pretty
[4129.14 --> 4129.62]  much only
[4129.62 --> 4130.18]  one right
[4130.18 --> 4131.10]  move and
[4131.10 --> 4131.88]  any kind
[4131.88 --> 4132.78]  of AI
[4132.78 --> 4133.42]  that's not
[4133.42 --> 4134.12]  powered by
[4134.12 --> 4134.86]  like you
[4134.86 --> 4137.38]  know chimpanzees
[4137.38 --> 4138.26]  is probably
[4138.26 --> 4138.70]  going to do
[4138.70 --> 4139.28]  just fine
[4139.28 --> 4141.20]  so I mean
[4141.20 --> 4142.12]  realistically could
[4142.12 --> 4142.50]  they have
[4142.50 --> 4143.56]  written an
[4143.56 --> 4144.30]  autoplay button
[4144.30 --> 4144.82]  for Final
[4144.82 --> 4145.58]  Fantasy 3
[4145.58 --> 4146.50]  yes
[4146.50 --> 4148.10]  should they
[4148.10 --> 4149.16]  have no
[4149.16 --> 4150.22]  really doesn't
[4150.22 --> 4150.80]  enrich the
[4150.80 --> 4151.74]  gaming experience
[4151.74 --> 4152.02]  no
[4152.02 --> 4153.64]  oh we have
[4153.64 --> 4154.50]  really exciting
[4154.50 --> 4155.12]  news
[4155.12 --> 4156.88]  fractal design
[4156.88 --> 4158.28]  is going to
[4158.28 --> 4159.16]  be joining us
[4159.16 --> 4159.44]  for the
[4159.44 --> 4159.94]  live stream
[4159.94 --> 4160.50]  next week
[4160.50 --> 4161.54]  so Josh
[4161.54 --> 4162.20]  from fractal
[4162.20 --> 4162.82]  design is
[4162.82 --> 4163.38]  going to be
[4163.38 --> 4164.62]  positioned in
[4164.62 --> 4165.38]  between me
[4165.38 --> 4165.86]  and slick
[4165.86 --> 4167.92]  and I mean
[4167.92 --> 4168.50]  if you want to
[4168.50 --> 4169.08]  get closer to
[4169.08 --> 4169.54]  me and have
[4169.54 --> 4169.88]  him on the
[4169.88 --> 4170.26]  other side
[4170.26 --> 4170.64]  that's fine
[4170.64 --> 4170.86]  too
[4170.86 --> 4172.50]  but yeah
[4172.50 --> 4172.90]  we're really
[4172.90 --> 4173.40]  excited about
[4173.40 --> 4174.04]  that so we'd
[4174.04 --> 4174.66]  love for you
[4174.66 --> 4175.58]  guys to go
[4175.58 --> 4176.02]  ahead and
[4176.02 --> 4176.62]  actually if we
[4176.62 --> 4176.94]  could have
[4176.94 --> 4177.80]  someone watching
[4177.80 --> 4178.46]  the live stream
[4178.46 --> 4179.44]  do us a huge
[4179.44 --> 4180.90]  favor and in
[4180.90 --> 4181.90]  the computer cases
[4181.90 --> 4182.70]  section if you
[4182.70 --> 4183.32]  could sticky it
[4183.32 --> 4183.96]  after the live
[4183.96 --> 4185.28]  stream go ahead
[4185.28 --> 4186.54]  and okay please
[4186.54 --> 4187.34]  don't six of
[4187.34 --> 4187.98]  you go create
[4187.98 --> 4189.10]  them now but
[4189.10 --> 4189.58]  go ahead
[4189.58 --> 4190.24]  we've got a
[4190.24 --> 4191.20]  bunch of mods
[4191.20 --> 4192.36]  please guys
[4192.36 --> 4192.74]  yeah
[4192.74 --> 4193.38]  clean this up
[4193.38 --> 4193.92]  merge the
[4193.92 --> 4194.24]  topics
[4194.24 --> 4195.80]  but we'd love
[4195.80 --> 4196.40]  for you guys to
[4196.40 --> 4197.28]  post any questions
[4197.28 --> 4198.04]  that you'd like
[4198.04 --> 4199.02]  Josh to address
[4199.02 --> 4200.08]  about fractal
[4200.08 --> 4201.12]  design cases or
[4201.12 --> 4202.06]  power supplies or
[4202.06 --> 4203.48]  other products and
[4203.48 --> 4204.42]  yeah we're going to
[4204.42 --> 4205.10]  have a really great
[4205.10 --> 4206.08]  discussion we're not
[4206.08 --> 4206.74]  going to be limited
[4206.74 --> 4207.66]  to just fractal
[4207.66 --> 4208.46]  design talk though
[4208.46 --> 4209.52]  we're going to do
[4209.52 --> 4210.52]  our usual thing with
[4210.52 --> 4211.26]  Twitter Q&A and
[4211.26 --> 4211.72]  you guys will be
[4211.72 --> 4212.76]  welcome to sending
[4212.76 --> 4213.56]  questions on Twitter
[4213.56 --> 4214.06]  and we'll try and
[4214.06 --> 4214.62]  get to them if we
[4214.62 --> 4215.26]  can but some
[4215.26 --> 4215.90]  times it can be a
[4215.90 --> 4216.46]  bit of a challenge
[4216.46 --> 4217.94]  but yeah we're
[4217.94 --> 4218.76]  really really excited
[4218.76 --> 4219.44]  about that I think
[4219.44 --> 4219.94]  that's going to be
[4219.94 --> 4220.98]  freaking awesome
[4220.98 --> 4222.02]  I'm just messaging
[4222.02 --> 4222.60]  myself so don't
[4222.60 --> 4223.58]  forget about that
[4223.58 --> 4224.84]  okay good work
[4224.84 --> 4226.56]  you're unfired once
[4226.56 --> 4227.40]  yay
[4227.40 --> 4229.90]  so now I don't get
[4229.90 --> 4230.64]  fired during the day
[4230.64 --> 4231.50]  I only get fired
[4231.50 --> 4232.22]  during live streams
[4232.22 --> 4233.80]  that's true I haven't
[4233.80 --> 4234.42]  fired you at all
[4234.42 --> 4235.16]  at all this week
[4235.16 --> 4235.84]  mind you've been
[4235.84 --> 4236.58]  working really hard
[4236.58 --> 4237.44]  this week on stuff
[4237.44 --> 4238.16]  that I frankly
[4238.16 --> 4238.84]  didn't want to do
[4238.84 --> 4240.34]  so yeah he did
[4240.34 --> 4241.26]  almost all of the
[4241.26 --> 4242.28]  benchmarking for Titan
[4242.28 --> 4243.08]  what did I do
[4243.08 --> 4244.34]  the only things
[4244.34 --> 4245.22]  that I didn't do
[4245.22 --> 4246.86]  was half of the
[4246.86 --> 4249.30]  3770k benchmarks
[4249.30 --> 4249.78]  over there
[4249.78 --> 4250.36]  so you ran
[4250.36 --> 4251.20]  no I did some
[4251.20 --> 4251.88]  of the 1080p
[4251.88 --> 4252.48]  benchmarks while
[4252.48 --> 4253.00]  you were sleeping
[4253.00 --> 4254.44]  didn't you notice
[4254.44 --> 4255.06]  when you came back
[4255.06 --> 4255.50]  a bunch of the
[4255.50 --> 4256.24]  benchmarks were run
[4256.24 --> 4257.84]  not that many
[4257.84 --> 4258.88]  well some of them
[4258.88 --> 4259.60]  were and I did
[4259.60 --> 4260.20]  some of the 3D
[4260.20 --> 4260.94]  benchmarks as well
[4260.94 --> 4261.50]  yes you did
[4261.50 --> 4262.32]  you did one
[4262.32 --> 4263.48]  platform for 3D
[4263.48 --> 4264.42]  one platform for 3D
[4264.42 --> 4264.82]  and then I think
[4264.82 --> 4265.46]  I did a couple of
[4265.46 --> 4266.18]  them on 1080p
[4266.18 --> 4266.74]  so there
[4266.74 --> 4267.34]  bam
[4267.34 --> 4268.34]  I did at least
[4268.34 --> 4270.46]  or like I finished
[4270.46 --> 4271.02]  one and then
[4271.02 --> 4271.66]  finished Titan
[4271.66 --> 4272.24]  or something like
[4272.24 --> 4273.04]  that
[4273.04 --> 4273.68]  yeah that might
[4273.68 --> 4273.92]  have been it
[4273.92 --> 4274.22]  don't worry
[4274.22 --> 4275.00]  Slicks and my
[4275.00 --> 4276.06]  testing methodologies
[4276.06 --> 4276.94]  are still very
[4276.94 --> 4277.66]  very very very
[4277.66 --> 4278.08]  close so it
[4278.08 --> 4278.40]  doesn't matter
[4278.40 --> 4278.86]  who ran the
[4278.86 --> 4279.24]  benchmarks
[4279.24 --> 4280.34]  I trust them
[4280.34 --> 4280.74]  either way
[4280.74 --> 4281.78]  we record our
[4281.78 --> 4282.30]  own benchmarks
[4282.30 --> 4282.92]  and show them
[4282.92 --> 4283.54]  to each other
[4283.54 --> 4284.86]  so the second
[4284.86 --> 4285.76]  like that's where
[4285.76 --> 4286.52]  the idea for
[4286.52 --> 4286.96]  showing our
[4286.96 --> 4287.78]  benchmarks came from
[4287.78 --> 4288.34]  because we do
[4288.34 --> 4288.82]  that to each
[4288.82 --> 4289.52]  other anyways
[4289.52 --> 4290.02]  so we're like
[4290.02 --> 4290.56]  hey we might as
[4290.56 --> 4290.86]  well share it
[4290.86 --> 4291.26]  with everybody
[4291.26 --> 4292.12]  yeah that way
[4292.12 --> 4292.62]  you guys can
[4292.62 --> 4293.06]  test benchmark
[4293.06 --> 4293.74]  although you know
[4293.74 --> 4294.18]  I found out
[4294.18 --> 4294.72]  something funny
[4294.72 --> 4295.08]  about your
[4295.08 --> 4295.72]  Starcraft 2
[4295.72 --> 4296.76]  benching methodology
[4296.76 --> 4297.92]  that map isn't
[4297.92 --> 4298.62]  available in some
[4298.62 --> 4299.00]  regions
[4299.00 --> 4301.14]  oh oh that's
[4301.14 --> 4301.62]  unfortunate
[4301.62 --> 4302.40]  yeah
[4302.40 --> 4303.82]  so people are
[4303.82 --> 4304.46]  like oh I
[4304.46 --> 4305.22]  can't find it
[4305.22 --> 4306.28]  and then someone
[4306.28 --> 4307.10]  else jumped in
[4307.10 --> 4307.44]  and they're like
[4307.44 --> 4307.78]  yeah
[4307.78 --> 4308.96]  I mean the good
[4308.96 --> 4309.92]  news is Starcraft 2
[4309.92 --> 4310.50]  kind of runs on
[4310.50 --> 4311.26]  anything so who
[4311.26 --> 4311.48]  cares
[4311.48 --> 4312.46]  sorry guys
[4312.46 --> 4313.02]  yeah
[4313.02 --> 4313.98]  yeah
[4313.98 --> 4315.28]  sorry for being
[4315.28 --> 4315.82]  noob
[4315.82 --> 4317.12]  at Starcraft 2
[4317.12 --> 4317.48]  what was I
[4317.48 --> 4318.18]  supposed to know
[4318.18 --> 4319.02]  oh man
[4319.02 --> 4319.78]  Jeremy's comment
[4319.78 --> 4320.36]  is so good
[4320.36 --> 4320.98]  cars are different
[4320.98 --> 4321.62]  from computers
[4321.62 --> 4322.32]  I love it
[4322.32 --> 4323.08]  um
[4323.08 --> 4325.30]  hard to say
[4325.30 --> 4326.30]  I would
[4326.30 --> 4326.62]  I
[4326.62 --> 4327.18]  I tend to
[4327.18 --> 4327.70]  prefer single
[4327.70 --> 4328.38]  GPU solution
[4328.38 --> 4328.88]  so Alex
[4328.88 --> 4329.48]  I'd probably
[4329.48 --> 4330.18]  pawn it off
[4330.18 --> 4330.56]  and get a
[4330.56 --> 4330.96]  670
[4330.96 --> 4332.26]  just built
[4332.26 --> 4333.48]  my 5800k
[4333.48 --> 4334.12]  PC in a
[4334.12 --> 4334.44]  Roseville
[4334.44 --> 4335.04]  Challenger
[4335.04 --> 4336.32]  running stock
[4336.32 --> 4336.76]  graphics
[4336.76 --> 4337.28]  what should I
[4337.28 --> 4337.68]  upgrade
[4337.68 --> 4341.86]  lots of things
[4341.86 --> 4343.24]  sorry
[4343.24 --> 4344.04]  um
[4344.04 --> 4345.10]  I guess
[4345.10 --> 4345.42]  grab a
[4345.42 --> 4345.92]  graphics card
[4345.92 --> 4346.10]  I love
[4346.10 --> 4346.98]  I love
[4346.98 --> 4347.52]  how he lists
[4347.52 --> 4348.26]  his DVD drive
[4348.26 --> 4349.16]  get a 7850
[4349.16 --> 4349.50]  or something
[4349.50 --> 4350.18]  like that
[4350.18 --> 4351.20]  best tech
[4351.20 --> 4351.72]  live stream
[4351.72 --> 4352.26]  aww
[4352.26 --> 4353.08]  thank you
[4353.08 --> 4353.68]  yay
[4353.68 --> 4354.66]  is cold SC
[4354.66 --> 4355.00]  a thing
[4355.00 --> 4356.32]  that's my
[4356.32 --> 4357.56]  oh
[4357.56 --> 4358.92]  okay
[4358.92 --> 4360.10]  yay
[4360.10 --> 4360.60]  brother
[4360.60 --> 4361.34]  thank you
[4361.34 --> 4362.00]  hi Richard
[4362.00 --> 4363.48]  I agree with
[4363.48 --> 4363.86]  slick
[4363.86 --> 4365.50]  I knew I'd
[4365.50 --> 4365.96]  heard of it
[4365.96 --> 4366.38]  before
[4366.38 --> 4366.82]  but I didn't
[4366.82 --> 4367.52]  know why
[4367.52 --> 4370.08]  I agree with
[4370.08 --> 4370.50]  I have an
[4370.50 --> 4371.28]  Asus pro art
[4371.28 --> 4371.60]  as well
[4371.60 --> 4372.04]  yes
[4372.04 --> 4373.26]  way to go
[4373.26 --> 4374.18]  they're amazing
[4374.18 --> 4374.96]  I'm so sold
[4374.96 --> 4375.10]  now
[4375.10 --> 4375.70]  before I bought
[4375.70 --> 4376.12]  them I was
[4376.12 --> 4376.64]  like oh
[4376.64 --> 4376.98]  I don't know
[4376.98 --> 4377.62]  if this is worth
[4377.62 --> 4377.92]  it
[4377.92 --> 4378.32]  Corey
[4378.32 --> 4379.34]  Corey gets
[4379.34 --> 4380.34]  a major gold
[4380.34 --> 4380.74]  star
[4380.74 --> 4381.66]  for just being
[4381.66 --> 4382.06]  awesome
[4382.06 --> 4383.08]  getting to listen
[4383.08 --> 4383.72]  to the live stream
[4383.72 --> 4384.04]  with my
[4384.04 --> 4384.90]  ZonarSTX
[4384.90 --> 4385.64]  awesome sound
[4385.64 --> 4385.96]  card
[4385.96 --> 4386.50]  and typing
[4386.50 --> 4386.96]  with the new
[4386.96 --> 4387.26]  ducky
[4387.26 --> 4388.72]  he tweeted
[4388.72 --> 4389.40]  at me earlier
[4389.40 --> 4390.00]  I don't know
[4390.00 --> 4390.92]  what day it was
[4390.92 --> 4391.58]  because this whole
[4391.58 --> 4392.14]  week is one
[4392.14 --> 4393.20]  gigantic blob
[4393.20 --> 4393.94]  saying that he
[4393.94 --> 4394.62]  got that sound
[4394.62 --> 4395.04]  card and got
[4395.04 --> 4395.58]  that keyboard
[4395.58 --> 4395.90]  and I was
[4395.90 --> 4396.56]  like yes
[4396.56 --> 4397.38]  Joshua
[4397.38 --> 4398.22]  had a great
[4398.22 --> 4398.64]  question
[4398.64 --> 4399.20]  can you guys
[4399.20 --> 4399.82]  explain how
[4399.82 --> 4400.28]  to achieve
[4400.28 --> 4401.26]  positive airflow
[4401.26 --> 4402.54]  inside a case
[4402.54 --> 4403.02]  during the live
[4403.02 --> 4403.42]  stream tonight
[4403.42 --> 4403.96]  we'd love to
[4403.96 --> 4405.34]  so I'm gonna
[4405.34 --> 4405.84]  go get some
[4405.84 --> 4406.46]  props while
[4406.46 --> 4407.20]  you get started
[4407.20 --> 4409.16]  I was just
[4409.16 --> 4409.46]  gonna grab
[4409.46 --> 4409.96]  C70
[4409.96 --> 4410.50]  and you're
[4410.50 --> 4410.80]  going over
[4410.80 --> 4410.96]  there
[4410.96 --> 4411.22]  so I don't
[4411.22 --> 4411.42]  know what
[4411.42 --> 4411.72]  you're doing
[4411.72 --> 4412.66]  no I'm
[4412.66 --> 4413.34]  well no you
[4413.34 --> 4413.76]  don't need a
[4413.76 --> 4414.02]  case
[4414.02 --> 4414.80]  just kind of
[4414.80 --> 4415.28]  explain it
[4415.28 --> 4415.62]  I'm looking
[4415.62 --> 4416.14]  for something
[4416.14 --> 4417.08]  the idea of
[4417.08 --> 4417.64]  positive airflow
[4417.64 --> 4418.38]  is to create
[4418.38 --> 4419.98]  a directional
[4419.98 --> 4420.40]  flow through
[4420.40 --> 4420.94]  your case
[4420.94 --> 4421.42]  so that you
[4421.42 --> 4421.90]  don't get
[4421.90 --> 4422.38]  an insane
[4422.38 --> 4422.74]  amount of
[4422.74 --> 4423.06]  dust
[4423.06 --> 4424.42]  and I
[4424.42 --> 4424.68]  believe it
[4424.68 --> 4425.02]  helps with
[4425.02 --> 4425.32]  temperatures
[4425.32 --> 4425.72]  as well
[4425.72 --> 4425.96]  right
[4425.96 --> 4426.76]  it's just
[4426.76 --> 4426.98]  kind of
[4426.98 --> 4427.26]  generally
[4427.26 --> 4427.66]  good
[4427.66 --> 4428.28]  all around
[4428.28 --> 4428.84]  generally
[4428.84 --> 4429.16]  good
[4429.16 --> 4429.52]  to not
[4429.52 --> 4429.80]  have
[4429.80 --> 4430.46]  well they
[4430.46 --> 4430.68]  can't
[4430.68 --> 4430.98]  hear me
[4430.98 --> 4431.20]  because of
[4431.20 --> 4431.50]  the shotgun
[4431.50 --> 4431.72]  mic
[4431.72 --> 4431.98]  but it's
[4431.98 --> 4432.26]  generally
[4432.26 --> 4432.58]  good to
[4432.58 --> 4432.80]  have
[4432.80 --> 4433.24]  positive
[4433.24 --> 4433.80]  airflow
[4437.20 --> 4438.02]  okay yeah
[4438.02 --> 4438.36]  so what
[4438.36 --> 4438.84]  he's generally
[4438.84 --> 4439.36]  saying is
[4439.36 --> 4439.60]  that it
[4439.60 --> 4439.96]  helps with
[4439.96 --> 4440.22]  dust
[4440.22 --> 4440.66]  which in
[4440.66 --> 4440.98]  relation
[4440.98 --> 4441.26]  helps
[4441.26 --> 4441.46]  with
[4441.46 --> 4441.72]  temps
[4441.72 --> 4442.52]  because
[4442.52 --> 4443.72]  if you
[4443.72 --> 4444.02]  don't have
[4444.02 --> 4444.28]  everything
[4444.28 --> 4444.68]  caked in
[4444.68 --> 4445.00]  dust
[4445.00 --> 4445.34]  it's not
[4445.34 --> 4445.52]  going to
[4445.52 --> 4445.80]  get as
[4445.80 --> 4446.08]  hot
[4446.08 --> 4451.40]  they can't
[4451.40 --> 4452.02]  hear you
[4452.02 --> 4452.62]  so oh
[4452.62 --> 4452.80]  well
[4452.80 --> 4453.86]  I think
[4453.86 --> 4454.08]  it should
[4454.08 --> 4454.28]  be out
[4454.28 --> 4454.44]  in the
[4454.44 --> 4454.64]  hallway
[4454.64 --> 4456.82]  probably
[4456.82 --> 4463.20]  so I
[4463.20 --> 4463.44]  was trying
[4463.44 --> 4463.68]  to find
[4463.68 --> 4464.02]  a fan
[4464.02 --> 4464.30]  filter
[4464.30 --> 4464.60]  because
[4464.60 --> 4464.94]  one of
[4464.94 --> 4465.06]  the
[4465.06 --> 4465.42]  key
[4465.42 --> 4465.88]  things
[4465.88 --> 4466.34]  about
[4466.34 --> 4466.80]  creating
[4466.80 --> 4467.22]  positive
[4467.22 --> 4467.42]  air
[4467.42 --> 4467.88]  pressure
[4467.88 --> 4468.04]  in
[4468.04 --> 4468.16]  your
[4468.16 --> 4468.52]  case
[4468.52 --> 4469.20]  is
[4469.20 --> 4469.58]  that
[4469.58 --> 4470.04]  you
[4470.04 --> 4470.48]  should
[4470.48 --> 4470.66]  have
[4470.66 --> 4471.16]  filtered
[4471.16 --> 4471.70]  intakes
[4471.70 --> 4472.00]  on your
[4472.00 --> 4472.24]  case
[4472.24 --> 4472.70]  in fact
[4472.70 --> 4472.86]  you know
[4472.86 --> 4472.98]  what
[4472.98 --> 4473.14]  one of
[4473.14 --> 4473.30]  these
[4473.30 --> 4473.64]  cases
[4473.64 --> 4473.98]  probably
[4473.98 --> 4474.28]  has a
[4474.28 --> 4474.50]  filter
[4474.50 --> 4476.32]  there you
[4476.32 --> 4476.56]  go
[4476.56 --> 4476.94]  yeah
[4476.94 --> 4477.26]  okay
[4477.26 --> 4477.88]  so here's
[4477.88 --> 4478.18]  a filter
[4478.18 --> 4478.54]  from the
[4478.54 --> 4478.74]  bottom
[4478.74 --> 4479.00]  of a
[4479.00 --> 4479.20]  course
[4479.20 --> 4479.36]  air
[4479.36 --> 4479.78]  c70
[4479.78 --> 4480.50]  so
[4480.50 --> 4481.28]  positive
[4481.28 --> 4481.52]  air
[4481.52 --> 4481.94]  pressure
[4481.94 --> 4483.54]  means
[4483.54 --> 4484.50]  okay
[4484.50 --> 4484.86]  okay
[4484.86 --> 4485.48]  so your
[4485.48 --> 4485.74]  case
[4485.74 --> 4485.98]  has
[4485.98 --> 4486.28]  lots
[4486.28 --> 4486.42]  of
[4486.42 --> 4486.80]  openings
[4486.80 --> 4487.60]  it
[4487.60 --> 4487.96]  has
[4487.96 --> 4488.60]  intakes
[4488.60 --> 4489.38]  and it
[4489.38 --> 4489.58]  has
[4489.58 --> 4490.06]  exhaust
[4490.06 --> 4491.42]  so a
[4491.42 --> 4491.62]  lot
[4491.62 --> 4491.70]  of
[4491.70 --> 4491.88]  those

[4493.48 --> 4493.88]  or
[4493.88 --> 4494.04]  they
[4494.04 --> 4494.34]  can
[4494.34 --> 4494.60]  have

[4500.08 --> 4500.26]  has
[4500.26 --> 4500.48]  these
[4500.48 --> 4500.84]  holes
[4500.84 --> 4501.08]  look
[4501.08 --> 4501.24]  I'm
[4501.24 --> 4501.40]  going

[4502.14 --> 4502.30]  these
[4502.30 --> 4502.54]  holes
[4502.54 --> 4502.74]  you
[4502.74 --> 4502.88]  can
[4502.88 --> 4503.06]  put
[4503.06 --> 4503.28]  these
[4503.28 --> 4503.78]  fans

[4510.96 --> 4511.16]  going to
[4511.16 --> 4511.50]  understand
[4511.50 --> 4511.84]  this
[4511.84 --> 4512.06]  but
[4512.06 --> 4512.58]  this
[4512.58 --> 4512.70]  is
[4512.70 --> 4512.84]  a

[4526.30 --> 4526.50]  on
[4526.50 --> 4526.86]  topic
[4526.86 --> 4527.14]  so
[4527.14 --> 4527.36]  your

[4529.20 --> 4529.36]  in
[4529.36 --> 4529.52]  it
[4529.52 --> 4529.90]  some

[4530.08 --> 4530.32]  which
[4530.32 --> 4530.58]  are
[4530.58 --> 4530.76]  the

[4531.10 --> 4531.58]  that
[4531.58 --> 4531.96]  fans
[4531.96 --> 4532.12]  will
[4532.12 --> 4532.30]  go
[4532.30 --> 4532.44]  in
[4532.44 --> 4534.04]  some
[4534.04 --> 4534.44]  of
[4534.44 --> 4534.82]  them
[4534.82 --> 4535.66]  could
[4535.66 --> 4535.84]  be
[4535.84 --> 4536.22]  little
[4536.22 --> 4536.88]  cracks
[4536.88 --> 4537.28]  or

[4539.26 --> 4540.16]  or even
[4540.16 --> 4540.58]  screw
[4540.58 --> 4540.92]  holes
[4540.92 --> 4541.14]  that
[4541.14 --> 4541.32]  aren't
[4541.32 --> 4541.82]  populated
[4541.82 --> 4542.32]  and
[4542.32 --> 4542.76]  those
[4542.76 --> 4543.06]  are
[4543.06 --> 4543.28]  a
[4543.28 --> 4543.84]  major
[4543.84 --> 4544.52]  dust
[4544.52 --> 4544.92]  problem
[4544.92 --> 4545.38]  so
[4545.38 --> 4545.58]  when
[4545.58 --> 4545.72]  you
[4545.72 --> 4546.12]  have
[4546.12 --> 4546.38]  a
[4546.38 --> 4546.78]  case
[4546.78 --> 4547.22]  where
[4547.22 --> 4547.34]  I
[4547.34 --> 4547.46]  mean
[4547.46 --> 4547.74]  lots
[4547.74 --> 4547.84]  of
[4547.84 --> 4548.10]  cases
[4548.10 --> 4548.34]  these
[4548.34 --> 4548.54]  days
[4548.54 --> 4548.86]  have

[4551.24 --> 4551.68]  exhaust
[4551.68 --> 4551.88]  and
[4551.88 --> 4552.00]  what
[4552.00 --> 4552.26]  people
[4552.26 --> 4552.50]  tend
[4552.50 --> 4552.64]  to
[4552.64 --> 4552.76]  do
[4552.76 --> 4552.88]  is
[4552.88 --> 4553.00]  they
[4553.00 --> 4553.14]  tend
[4553.14 --> 4553.24]  to
[4553.24 --> 4553.38]  go
[4553.38 --> 4553.68]  oh
[4553.68 --> 4554.26]  that's
[4554.26 --> 4554.44]  really
[4554.44 --> 4554.82]  close
[4554.82 --> 4555.18]  to

[4555.64 --> 4556.04]  CPU
[4556.04 --> 4556.44]  socket
[4556.44 --> 4556.94]  so
[4556.94 --> 4557.04]  I
[4557.04 --> 4557.20]  should
[4557.20 --> 4557.38]  move
[4557.38 --> 4557.52]  the

[4559.78 --> 4560.08]  there
[4560.08 --> 4560.52]  and
[4560.52 --> 4560.68]  the

[4563.52 --> 4563.86]  air
[4563.86 --> 4565.04]  which
[4565.04 --> 4565.24]  it
[4565.24 --> 4565.56]  will
[4565.56 --> 4566.18]  but
[4566.18 --> 4566.34]  the

[4566.84 --> 4567.08]  with

[4567.36 --> 4567.72]  is
[4567.72 --> 4567.86]  that
[4567.86 --> 4567.96]  it

[4570.74 --> 4571.08]  holes
[4571.08 --> 4571.62]  but
[4571.62 --> 4572.08]  also
[4572.08 --> 4572.54]  from
[4572.54 --> 4572.92]  little

[4583.84 --> 4584.50]  environment
[4584.50 --> 4586.20]  than
[4586.20 --> 4586.62]  it is
[4586.62 --> 4586.94]  if you
[4586.94 --> 4587.10]  have
[4587.10 --> 4587.50]  positive

[4589.64 --> 4589.84]  air
[4589.84 --> 4590.16]  pressure

[4591.56 --> 4592.00]  fans

[4596.32 --> 4596.64]  going
[4596.64 --> 4596.92]  out
[4596.92 --> 4597.36]  so
[4597.36 --> 4597.68]  those
[4597.68 --> 4598.06]  fans
[4598.06 --> 4598.22]  that
[4598.22 --> 4598.32]  are
[4598.32 --> 4598.78]  exhausting
[4598.78 --> 4599.12]  actually
[4599.12 --> 4599.28]  get
[4599.28 --> 4599.38]  a

[4600.26 --> 4600.80]  performance
[4600.80 --> 4601.94]  improvement
[4601.94 --> 4602.46]  because
[4602.46 --> 4603.00]  the air

[4603.98 --> 4604.14]  them
[4604.14 --> 4604.56]  already
[4604.56 --> 4604.82]  when
[4604.82 --> 4604.94]  they
[4604.94 --> 4605.42]  exhaust
[4605.42 --> 4605.84]  and
[4605.84 --> 4605.94]  what
[4605.94 --> 4606.04]  it
[4606.04 --> 4606.30]  also
[4606.30 --> 4606.60]  does
[4606.60 --> 4606.74]  is
[4606.74 --> 4606.80]  it
[4606.80 --> 4607.04]  means
[4607.04 --> 4607.20]  that
[4607.20 --> 4607.42]  all
[4607.42 --> 4607.68]  those
[4607.68 --> 4607.96]  little
[4607.96 --> 4608.36]  holes
[4608.36 --> 4608.52]  in
[4608.52 --> 4608.64]  the
[4608.64 --> 4609.00]  case
[4609.00 --> 4609.76]  whether
[4609.76 --> 4610.10]  it's
[4610.10 --> 4610.84]  a
[4610.84 --> 4611.18]  seam
[4611.18 --> 4611.44]  around
[4611.44 --> 4611.58]  the
[4611.58 --> 4611.72]  edge
[4611.72 --> 4611.80]  of
[4611.80 --> 4611.92]  your
[4611.92 --> 4612.16]  side
[4612.16 --> 4612.48]  panel
[4612.48 --> 4612.62]  or
[4612.62 --> 4612.90]  whatever
[4612.90 --> 4613.28]  else
[4613.28 --> 4613.78]  are
[4613.78 --> 4614.14]  not
[4614.14 --> 4614.48]  going
[4614.48 --> 4614.70]  to
[4614.70 --> 4614.90]  be
[4614.90 --> 4615.26]  sucking
[4615.26 --> 4615.58]  in
[4615.58 --> 4616.02]  dust
[4616.02 --> 4616.80]  you're
[4616.80 --> 4617.36]  essentially
[4617.36 --> 4617.76]  letting
[4617.76 --> 4617.94]  it
[4617.94 --> 4618.22]  float
[4618.22 --> 4618.60]  out
[4618.60 --> 4619.48]  instead
[4619.48 --> 4619.64]  of

[4619.82 --> 4619.94]  it
[4619.94 --> 4620.12]  float
[4620.12 --> 4620.38]  in
[4620.38 --> 4620.74]  yes
[4620.74 --> 4621.22]  so
[4621.22 --> 4621.40]  you're
[4621.40 --> 4621.54]  not
[4621.54 --> 4621.84]  sucking
[4621.84 --> 4622.04]  up
[4622.04 --> 4622.32]  dust
[4622.32 --> 4622.62]  so
[4622.62 --> 4623.00]  that's
[4623.00 --> 4623.48]  why
[4623.48 --> 4623.80]  for
[4623.80 --> 4623.94]  a
[4623.94 --> 4624.34]  positive

[4624.92 --> 4625.42]  set up
[4625.42 --> 4625.60]  to
[4625.60 --> 4625.98]  actually
[4625.98 --> 4626.18]  get
[4626.18 --> 4626.30]  the
[4626.30 --> 4626.48]  most
[4626.48 --> 4626.90]  benefit
[4626.90 --> 4627.32]  you
[4627.32 --> 4627.64]  want
[4627.64 --> 4628.40]  intakes
[4628.40 --> 4628.92]  more
[4628.92 --> 4629.32]  intakes
[4629.32 --> 4629.48]  than
[4629.48 --> 4629.90]  exhaust
[4629.90 --> 4630.14]  and
[4630.14 --> 4630.24]  you
[4630.24 --> 4630.46]  want
[4630.46 --> 4630.66]  those
[4630.66 --> 4630.94]  intakes
[4630.94 --> 4631.08]  to
[4631.08 --> 4631.24]  be
[4631.24 --> 4631.60]  filtered
[4631.60 --> 4632.22]  because
[4632.22 --> 4632.74]  if
[4632.74 --> 4632.90]  you're
[4632.90 --> 4633.14]  using
[4633.14 --> 4633.56]  positive
[4633.56 --> 4633.76]  air
[4633.76 --> 4634.06]  pressure
[4634.06 --> 4634.26]  but
[4634.26 --> 4634.42]  you're
[4634.42 --> 4634.60]  just
[4634.60 --> 4634.84]  sucking
[4634.84 --> 4635.06]  in
[4635.06 --> 4635.32]  dusty
[4635.32 --> 4635.56]  air
[4635.56 --> 4636.52]  anyway
[4636.52 --> 4637.54]  then
[4637.54 --> 4638.12]  yeah
[4638.12 --> 4638.34]  you
[4638.34 --> 4638.54]  won't
[4638.54 --> 4638.70]  get
[4638.70 --> 4638.92]  dust
[4638.92 --> 4639.24]  quite
[4639.24 --> 4639.42]  as
[4639.42 --> 4639.76]  fast
[4639.76 --> 4639.92]  as
[4639.92 --> 4640.04]  if
[4640.04 --> 4640.18]  you're
[4640.18 --> 4640.40]  sucking
[4640.40 --> 4640.62]  air
[4640.62 --> 4640.76]  in
[4640.76 --> 4640.88]  through
[4640.88 --> 4641.02]  the
[4641.02 --> 4641.22]  bottom
[4641.22 --> 4641.34]  of
[4641.34 --> 4641.44]  the
[4641.44 --> 4641.66]  case
[4641.66 --> 4641.82]  where
[4641.82 --> 4641.98]  there
[4641.98 --> 4642.22]  is
[4642.22 --> 4642.40]  more
[4642.40 --> 4642.68]  dust
[4642.68 --> 4643.04]  settling
[4643.04 --> 4643.60]  but
[4643.60 --> 4643.76]  you
[4643.76 --> 4644.04]  will
[4644.04 --> 4644.44]  eventually
[4644.44 --> 4644.70]  get
[4644.70 --> 4644.92]  dust
[4644.92 --> 4645.30]  buildup
[4645.30 --> 4645.68]  a
[4645.68 --> 4646.18]  positive
[4646.18 --> 4646.58]  air
[4646.58 --> 4646.98]  pressure
[4646.98 --> 4648.00]  a
[4648.00 --> 4648.42]  positive
[4648.42 --> 4649.04]  airflow
[4649.04 --> 4649.48]  whatever
[4649.48 --> 4649.66]  you
[4649.66 --> 4649.78]  want
[4649.78 --> 4649.88]  to
[4649.88 --> 4650.02]  call
[4650.02 --> 4650.12]  it
[4650.12 --> 4650.30]  whatever
[4650.30 --> 4650.72]  positive
[4659.90 --> 4660.12]  and
[4660.12 --> 4660.24]  if
[4660.24 --> 4660.42]  you're
[4660.42 --> 4660.66]  worried
[4660.66 --> 4660.88]  about
[4660.88 --> 4661.06]  them
[4661.06 --> 4661.46]  being
[4661.46 --> 4662.28]  as
[4662.28 --> 4662.48]  hard
[4662.48 --> 4662.58]  as
[4662.58 --> 4662.74]  they
[4662.74 --> 4663.12]  are
[4663.12 --> 4663.30]  to
[4663.30 --> 4663.60]  install
[4663.60 --> 4663.82]  which
[4663.82 --> 4663.92]  is
[4663.92 --> 4664.12]  not
[4664.12 --> 4664.42]  hard
[4664.42 --> 4664.74]  you
[4664.74 --> 4664.90]  can
[4664.90 --> 4665.12]  get
[4665.12 --> 4665.62]  these
[4665.62 --> 4666.08]  super
[4666.08 --> 4666.44]  easy
[4666.44 --> 4666.78]  super
[4666.78 --> 4667.22]  intuitive
[4667.22 --> 4667.56]  fan
[4667.56 --> 4667.92]  filters
[4667.92 --> 4669.92]  that
[4669.92 --> 4670.16]  just
[4670.16 --> 4670.42]  like
[4670.42 --> 4671.16]  magnetically
[4671.16 --> 4671.80]  clip on
[4671.80 --> 4672.08]  so you
[4672.08 --> 4672.14]  can
[4672.14 --> 4672.48]  be like
[4672.48 --> 4672.86]  bam
[4672.86 --> 4673.14]  fan
[4673.14 --> 4673.44]  filter
[4673.44 --> 4673.96]  so
[4673.96 --> 4674.74]  those
[4674.74 --> 4674.84]  are
[4674.84 --> 4675.00]  really
[4675.00 --> 4675.22]  cool
[4675.22 --> 4675.56]  another
[4675.56 --> 4676.08]  sort
[4676.08 --> 4676.20]  of
[4676.20 --> 4676.40]  cheap
[4676.40 --> 4676.76]  DIY
[4676.76 --> 4677.28]  solution
[4677.28 --> 4677.44]  is
[4677.44 --> 4677.56]  to
[4677.56 --> 4677.68]  use
[4677.68 --> 4677.92]  black
[4677.92 --> 4678.24]  panty
[4678.24 --> 4678.48]  hose
[4678.48 --> 4679.72]  yes
[4679.72 --> 4681.58]  I've
[4681.58 --> 4681.76]  actually
[4681.76 --> 4681.98]  heard of
[4681.98 --> 4682.08]  that
[4682.08 --> 4682.20]  I've
[4682.20 --> 4682.32]  never
[4682.32 --> 4682.48]  done
[4682.48 --> 4682.66]  that
[4682.66 --> 4682.80]  but
[4682.80 --> 4682.92]  I've
[4682.92 --> 4683.04]  heard
[4683.04 --> 4683.14]  of
[4683.14 --> 4683.32]  that
[4683.32 --> 4685.32]  the
[4685.32 --> 4685.60]  stream
[4685.60 --> 4685.74]  is
[4685.74 --> 4686.08]  choppy
[4686.08 --> 4686.48]  apparently
[4686.48 --> 4687.04]  it's
[4687.04 --> 4687.16]  an
[4687.16 --> 4687.40]  issue
[4687.40 --> 4687.66]  with
[4687.66 --> 4687.82]  the

[4688.30 --> 4688.56]  media
[4688.56 --> 4689.04]  card
[4689.04 --> 4689.32]  I
[4689.32 --> 4690.70]  talked
[4690.70 --> 4690.88]  about
[4690.88 --> 4690.98]  it
[4690.98 --> 4691.08]  at
[4691.08 --> 4691.16]  the
[4691.16 --> 4691.46]  beginning
[4691.46 --> 4692.18]  resetting
[4692.18 --> 4692.34]  it
[4692.34 --> 4692.60]  fixes
[4692.60 --> 4692.80]  it
[4692.80 --> 4692.94]  for
[4692.94 --> 4693.04]  a
[4693.04 --> 4693.14]  little
[4693.14 --> 4693.40]  while
[4693.40 --> 4693.70]  so
[4693.70 --> 4694.30]  there
[4694.30 --> 4694.42]  you
[4694.42 --> 4694.60]  go

[4695.08 --> 4695.20]  we
[4695.20 --> 4695.32]  have
[4695.32 --> 4695.60]  a lot
[4695.60 --> 4695.70]  of
[4695.70 --> 4695.96]  viewers
[4695.96 --> 4696.24]  tonight
[4696.24 --> 4696.52]  thank
[4696.52 --> 4696.68]  you
[4696.68 --> 4697.06]  guys
[4697.06 --> 4697.30]  thank
[4697.30 --> 4697.50]  you
[4697.50 --> 4697.66]  for
[4697.66 --> 4697.92]  tuning
[4697.92 --> 4698.14]  in
[4698.14 --> 4699.58]  oh
[4699.58 --> 4699.94]  my
[4699.94 --> 4700.26]  goodness
[4700.26 --> 4700.52]  it's
[4700.52 --> 4701.14]  1030
[4701.14 --> 4702.26]  the
[4702.26 --> 4702.50]  live
[4702.50 --> 4702.70]  stream
[4702.70 --> 4702.84]  is
[4702.84 --> 4703.26]  technically
[4703.26 --> 4703.62]  over
[4703.62 --> 4703.78]  I
[4703.78 --> 4703.92]  don't
[4703.92 --> 4704.10]  think
[4704.10 --> 4704.26]  we
[4704.26 --> 4705.16]  went
[4705.16 --> 4705.40]  long
[4705.40 --> 4705.66]  last
[4705.66 --> 4705.86]  time
[4705.86 --> 4706.66]  yeah
[4706.66 --> 4706.80]  I
[4706.80 --> 4707.00]  guess
[4707.00 --> 4707.20]  we're
[4713.32 --> 4714.04]  get
[4714.04 --> 4714.22]  it
[4714.22 --> 4714.56]  get
[4714.56 --> 4714.86]  it
[4714.86 --> 4715.88]  double
[4715.88 --> 4716.34]  meaning
[4716.34 --> 4718.18]  yeah
[4718.18 --> 4722.32]  it's
[4722.32 --> 4722.92]  horrible
[4722.92 --> 4723.90]  we're past
[4723.90 --> 4724.30]  our time
[4724.30 --> 4724.76]  doesn't matter
[4724.76 --> 4725.32]  about quality
[4725.32 --> 4726.00]  jokes anymore
[4726.00 --> 4726.50]  yeah that's
[4726.50 --> 4726.68]  right
[4726.68 --> 4727.62]  this is the
[4727.62 --> 4727.98]  after part
[4727.98 --> 4728.50]  where's that
[4728.50 --> 4728.64]  laptop
[4728.64 --> 4728.98]  what are you
[4728.98 --> 4729.44]  scrambling
[4729.44 --> 4729.74]  for
[4729.74 --> 4730.16]  oh I'm
[4730.16 --> 4730.54]  looking for
[4730.54 --> 4731.08]  the S7
[4731.08 --> 4731.48]  did you
[4731.48 --> 4731.78]  move it
[4731.78 --> 4732.06]  over there
[4732.06 --> 4732.44]  no you
[4732.44 --> 4732.76]  did
[4732.76 --> 4734.02]  dang it
[4734.02 --> 4734.50]  I was
[4734.50 --> 4735.28]  wondering why
[4735.28 --> 4736.02]  remember when
[4736.02 --> 4736.26]  I was like
[4736.26 --> 4736.66]  I can go
[4736.66 --> 4736.94]  get this
[4736.94 --> 4737.58]  officially my
[4737.58 --> 4738.20]  favorite laptop
[4738.20 --> 4738.76]  ever by the
[4738.76 --> 4738.92]  way
[4738.92 --> 4739.44]  I love this
[4739.44 --> 4739.72]  thing
[4739.72 --> 4740.50]  Aspire S7
[4740.50 --> 4741.26]  the one thing
[4741.26 --> 4741.70]  that I have to
[4741.70 --> 4742.28]  complain about
[4742.28 --> 4742.96]  is that the
[4742.96 --> 4743.48]  touchpad
[4743.48 --> 4744.44]  is a little
[4744.44 --> 4745.10]  bit on the
[4745.10 --> 4745.94]  a little bit
[4745.94 --> 4746.24]  on the
[4746.24 --> 4746.94]  leggy side
[4746.94 --> 4749.04]  and then
[4749.04 --> 4749.58]  it's multi
[4749.58 --> 4750.32]  it's multi
[4750.32 --> 4751.10]  touch
[4751.10 --> 4751.74]  and I'm not
[4751.74 --> 4752.28]  really used to
[4752.28 --> 4752.50]  it
[4752.50 --> 4753.08]  especially on
[4753.08 --> 4753.52]  Windows 8
[4753.52 --> 4753.96]  you've also
[4753.96 --> 4754.44]  had some
[4754.44 --> 4755.34]  unlucky times
[4755.34 --> 4755.64]  with the
[4755.64 --> 4756.04]  sleep button
[4756.04 --> 4756.50]  on the side
[4756.50 --> 4756.98]  oh yeah
[4756.98 --> 4757.24]  yeah
[4757.24 --> 4759.24]  it's just
[4759.24 --> 4759.40]  sleep
[4759.40 --> 4759.68]  and you know
[4759.68 --> 4760.06]  what it doesn't
[4760.06 --> 4760.52]  bother me that
[4760.52 --> 4760.98]  much because
[4760.98 --> 4761.80]  it's so fast
[4761.80 --> 4762.54]  like it's
[4762.54 --> 4763.24]  SSD based
[4763.24 --> 4763.94]  it's Windows 8
[4763.94 --> 4764.56]  so there you
[4764.56 --> 4765.08]  go I press
[4765.08 --> 4765.38]  the button
[4765.38 --> 4765.82]  for sleep
[4765.82 --> 4766.30]  just now
[4766.30 --> 4767.16]  so it goes
[4767.16 --> 4767.60]  to sleep
[4767.60 --> 4768.18]  I press the
[4768.18 --> 4768.56]  button right
[4768.56 --> 4769.06]  now to wake
[4769.06 --> 4769.40]  it up
[4769.40 --> 4770.32]  so if I
[4770.32 --> 4771.00]  accidentally put
[4771.00 --> 4771.40]  the laptop
[4771.40 --> 4772.06]  into sleep
[4772.06 --> 4772.88]  it takes
[4772.88 --> 4773.62]  exactly
[4773.62 --> 4774.64]  oh actually
[4774.64 --> 4774.94]  I don't know
[4774.94 --> 4775.22]  if it had
[4775.22 --> 4775.70]  finished going
[4775.70 --> 4776.08]  into sleep
[4776.08 --> 4776.28]  oh yeah
[4776.28 --> 4776.66]  there it goes
[4776.66 --> 4777.22]  it takes
[4777.22 --> 4777.94]  exactly this
[4777.94 --> 4778.50]  long to
[4778.50 --> 4778.96]  sort of get
[4778.96 --> 4779.32]  back to
[4779.32 --> 4780.10]  full functionality
[4780.10 --> 4781.04]  so it's
[4781.04 --> 4781.38]  really not
[4781.38 --> 4781.84]  that bad
[4781.84 --> 4784.08]  and it's
[4784.08 --> 4784.32]  the kind of
[4784.32 --> 4784.64]  thing I can
[4784.64 --> 4785.06]  get used to
[4785.06 --> 4785.74]  oh we haven't
[4785.74 --> 4786.20]  forgotten the
[4786.20 --> 4786.60]  Windows 8
[4786.60 --> 4786.88]  giveaway
[4786.88 --> 4788.16]  we are going
[4788.16 --> 4788.74]  to do that
[4788.74 --> 4789.86]  do we have a
[4789.86 --> 4790.14]  question
[4790.14 --> 4790.74]  no
[4790.74 --> 4791.62]  do you want
[4791.62 --> 4792.22]  to formulate
[4792.22 --> 4792.66]  a question
[4792.66 --> 4793.12]  while I talk
[4793.12 --> 4793.40]  about the
[4793.40 --> 4794.08]  HTC One
[4794.08 --> 4795.14]  sure
[4795.14 --> 4795.78]  is this
[4795.78 --> 4796.56]  going to be
[4796.56 --> 4796.90]  something
[4796.90 --> 4797.82]  about our
[4797.82 --> 4798.22]  show
[4798.22 --> 4798.52]  no no
[4798.52 --> 4798.88]  who cares
[4798.88 --> 4800.00]  come up
[4800.00 --> 4800.20]  with a
[4800.20 --> 4800.54]  question
[4800.54 --> 4801.16]  something
[4801.16 --> 4801.62]  preferably
[4801.62 --> 4802.28]  that they can't
[4802.28 --> 4802.58]  easily
[4802.88 --> 4803.50]  so maybe
[4803.50 --> 4804.12]  something related
[4804.12 --> 4804.78]  to our videos
[4804.78 --> 4808.64]  okay
[4808.64 --> 4809.02]  okay
[4809.02 --> 4810.56]  so the
[4810.56 --> 4811.74]  HTC One
[4811.74 --> 4812.66]  I would like to
[4812.66 --> 4813.28]  share a video
[4813.28 --> 4814.08]  with you guys
[4814.08 --> 4814.62]  about the
[4814.62 --> 4815.22]  HTC One
[4815.22 --> 4816.20]  so we've already
[4816.20 --> 4816.80]  seen the
[4816.80 --> 4818.16]  HTC One S
[4818.16 --> 4819.58]  and the One X
[4819.58 --> 4820.68]  which are
[4820.68 --> 4821.54]  some pretty high
[4821.54 --> 4822.64]  end Android phones
[4822.64 --> 4823.30]  well the One S
[4823.30 --> 4823.84]  isn't really that
[4823.84 --> 4824.16]  high end
[4824.16 --> 4824.68]  it's more like
[4824.68 --> 4826.18]  a mainstream
[4826.18 --> 4827.78]  Android phone
[4827.78 --> 4828.92]  well
[4828.92 --> 4830.00]  enthusiast
[4830.00 --> 4830.68]  you know
[4830.68 --> 4831.02]  whatever
[4831.02 --> 4831.38]  I'm going to
[4831.38 --> 4831.66]  give up
[4831.66 --> 4832.34]  on categorizing
[4832.34 --> 4832.50]  it
[4832.50 --> 4832.80]  it's a
[4832.80 --> 4833.52]  pretty nice
[4833.52 --> 4833.76]  phone
[4833.76 --> 4834.74]  metal backing
[4834.74 --> 4835.32]  beautifully
[4835.32 --> 4835.88]  constructed
[4835.88 --> 4837.40]  the HTC One
[4837.40 --> 4838.16]  takes that
[4838.16 --> 4838.94]  and completely
[4838.94 --> 4839.88]  blows it
[4839.88 --> 4840.38]  out of the
[4840.38 --> 4841.12]  freaking water
[4841.12 --> 4841.76]  like it's not
[4841.76 --> 4842.52]  even on the
[4842.52 --> 4842.76]  same
[4842.76 --> 4844.58]  playing field
[4844.58 --> 4845.44]  the One
[4845.44 --> 4846.70]  is HTC
[4846.70 --> 4847.12]  sort of
[4847.12 --> 4847.60]  envisioning
[4847.60 --> 4848.06]  this is all
[4848.06 --> 4848.86]  HTC talk
[4848.86 --> 4849.16]  right now
[4849.16 --> 4849.48]  this is all
[4849.48 --> 4849.68]  from the
[4849.68 --> 4850.14]  press release
[4850.14 --> 4850.70]  I haven't
[4850.70 --> 4851.04]  got my
[4851.04 --> 4851.40]  hands on
[4851.40 --> 4851.74]  one yet
[4851.74 --> 4852.04]  so
[4852.04 --> 4852.68]  yeah
[4852.68 --> 4853.66]  but they're
[4853.66 --> 4854.14]  saying this
[4854.14 --> 4855.16]  is the
[4855.16 --> 4856.34]  reimagining
[4856.34 --> 4857.64]  based on
[4857.64 --> 4858.78]  what they
[4858.78 --> 4859.34]  would really
[4859.34 --> 4860.06]  love for a
[4860.06 --> 4860.56]  phone to be
[4860.56 --> 4861.08]  in an
[4861.08 --> 4862.22]  ideal world
[4862.22 --> 4863.10]  so
[4863.10 --> 4864.86]  oh shoot
[4864.86 --> 4865.26]  I don't think
[4865.26 --> 4865.52]  I'm going to
[4865.52 --> 4865.90]  be able to
[4865.90 --> 4866.52]  sign in to
[4866.52 --> 4867.46]  that email
[4867.46 --> 4868.74]  that I sent
[4868.74 --> 4869.88]  to myself
[4869.88 --> 4871.32]  with the
[4871.32 --> 4873.26]  sure
[4873.26 --> 4873.62]  yeah
[4873.62 --> 4874.18]  that's not
[4874.18 --> 4874.56]  a bad one
[4874.56 --> 4875.42]  I don't know
[4875.42 --> 4875.84]  if anyone's
[4875.84 --> 4876.26]  actually going
[4876.26 --> 4876.48]  to be able
[4876.48 --> 4876.80]  to answer
[4876.80 --> 4877.18]  that though
[4877.18 --> 4877.60]  so come up
[4877.60 --> 4877.86]  with an
[4877.86 --> 4878.16]  alternate
[4878.16 --> 4881.18]  just a lot
[4881.18 --> 4881.34]  of them
[4881.34 --> 4881.56]  are too
[4881.56 --> 4881.86]  easy
[4881.86 --> 4882.90]  I'm really
[4882.90 --> 4883.46]  worried about
[4883.46 --> 4884.42]  in case you
[4884.42 --> 4884.74]  guys were
[4884.74 --> 4885.18]  wondering
[4885.18 --> 4886.20]  the
[4886.20 --> 4886.94]  streaming
[4886.94 --> 4887.42]  live
[4887.42 --> 4887.74]  streaming
[4887.74 --> 4888.14]  live
[4888.14 --> 4888.54]  yeah
[4888.54 --> 4889.34]  the reason
[4889.34 --> 4889.64]  that the
[4889.64 --> 4890.00]  live stream
[4890.00 --> 4890.58]  was so choppy
[4890.58 --> 4890.98]  last week
[4890.98 --> 4891.28]  because I
[4891.28 --> 4891.64]  accidentally
[4891.64 --> 4891.98]  hit a
[4891.98 --> 4892.40]  hotkey
[4892.40 --> 4893.48]  that was
[4893.48 --> 4894.30]  a local
[4894.30 --> 4895.38]  recording
[4895.38 --> 4895.96]  hotkey
[4895.96 --> 4897.32]  for twitch
[4897.32 --> 4898.04]  so I was
[4898.04 --> 4898.74]  live streaming
[4898.74 --> 4899.52]  and local
[4899.52 --> 4900.06]  recording at
[4900.06 --> 4900.72]  the same time
[4900.72 --> 4901.28]  which was
[4901.28 --> 4901.58]  causing
[4901.58 --> 4902.04]  performance
[4902.04 --> 4902.34]  issues
[4902.34 --> 4902.64]  so I'm
[4902.64 --> 4903.08]  really afraid
[4903.08 --> 4903.42]  to type
[4903.42 --> 4903.66]  anything
[4903.66 --> 4904.02]  into a
[4904.02 --> 4904.26]  browser
[4904.26 --> 4904.64]  right now
[4904.64 --> 4904.94]  because I
[4904.94 --> 4905.12]  can't
[4905.12 --> 4905.38]  remember
[4905.38 --> 4905.64]  what my
[4905.64 --> 4905.96]  hotkey
[4905.96 --> 4906.18]  is
[4906.18 --> 4906.92]  but it's
[4906.92 --> 4907.18]  okay
[4907.18 --> 4907.90]  because I
[4907.90 --> 4908.72]  just emailed
[4908.72 --> 4909.98]  to myself
[4909.98 --> 4911.22]  the
[4911.22 --> 4911.66]  the
[4911.66 --> 4911.90]  list
[4911.90 --> 4912.16]  of the
[4912.16 --> 4912.38]  things
[4912.38 --> 4912.72]  that
[4912.72 --> 4913.02]  are
[4913.02 --> 4913.20]  the
[4913.20 --> 4913.56]  link
[4913.56 --> 4913.88]  to this
[4913.88 --> 4914.10]  so
[4914.10 --> 4914.80]  so the
[4914.80 --> 4915.08]  one
[4915.08 --> 4915.46]  changes
[4915.46 --> 4915.74]  a few
[4915.74 --> 4915.98]  things
[4915.98 --> 4916.42]  fundamentally
[4916.42 --> 4916.92]  it has a
[4916.92 --> 4917.34]  unibody
[4917.34 --> 4917.78]  design
[4917.78 --> 4918.82]  which apparently
[4918.82 --> 4919.56]  according to
[4919.56 --> 4920.16]  HTC
[4920.16 --> 4921.28]  is taking
[4921.28 --> 4922.80]  200
[4922.80 --> 4924.42]  machine hours
[4924.42 --> 4925.76]  per chassis
[4925.76 --> 4927.10]  to machine
[4927.10 --> 4927.62]  this thing
[4927.62 --> 4928.24]  okay
[4928.24 --> 4929.30]  so I mean
[4929.30 --> 4930.06]  imagine that
[4930.06 --> 4930.36]  I mean
[4930.36 --> 4931.06]  the cost
[4931.06 --> 4931.82]  of a CNC
[4931.82 --> 4932.32]  machine
[4932.32 --> 4933.26]  is thousands
[4933.26 --> 4933.90]  and thousands
[4933.90 --> 4934.48]  of dollars
[4934.48 --> 4935.26]  so
[4935.26 --> 4935.98]  you know
[4935.98 --> 4936.70]  any time
[4936.70 --> 4937.30]  on a CNC
[4937.30 --> 4937.68]  machine
[4937.68 --> 4938.18]  any rental
[4938.18 --> 4938.52]  time
[4938.52 --> 4939.46]  is expensive
[4939.46 --> 4940.38]  not only
[4940.38 --> 4940.82]  that
[4940.82 --> 4941.36]  but the
[4941.36 --> 4941.74]  blades
[4941.74 --> 4942.68]  do dull
[4942.68 --> 4943.36]  they do
[4943.36 --> 4943.88]  wear out
[4943.88 --> 4945.04]  so you've
[4945.04 --> 4945.28]  got
[4945.28 --> 4946.16]  incremental
[4946.16 --> 4946.66]  additional
[4946.66 --> 4947.12]  cost
[4947.12 --> 4947.50]  in terms
[4947.50 --> 4948.08]  of blades
[4948.08 --> 4948.74]  so I don't
[4948.74 --> 4948.96]  know if
[4948.96 --> 4949.44]  HTC
[4949.44 --> 4949.96]  is outsourcing
[4949.96 --> 4950.60]  the manufacturing
[4950.60 --> 4951.04]  or I don't
[4951.04 --> 4951.36]  know if
[4951.36 --> 4951.84]  they've actually
[4951.84 --> 4952.32]  invested
[4952.32 --> 4953.02]  in the
[4953.02 --> 4953.40]  machinery
[4953.40 --> 4953.84]  it takes
[4953.84 --> 4954.24]  to build
[4954.24 --> 4954.62]  these on
[4954.62 --> 4955.04]  their own
[4955.04 --> 4955.82]  but these
[4955.82 --> 4956.22]  phones
[4956.22 --> 4956.60]  are
[4956.60 --> 4957.46]  freaking
[4957.46 --> 4958.00]  expensive
[4958.00 --> 4958.52]  to make
[4958.52 --> 4959.42]  not even
[4959.42 --> 4959.92]  completely
[4959.92 --> 4960.76]  ignoring
[4960.76 --> 4961.48]  the hardware
[4961.48 --> 4961.86]  specs
[4961.86 --> 4962.44]  hardware
[4962.44 --> 4962.84]  specs
[4962.84 --> 4963.82]  nothing to
[4963.82 --> 4963.96]  do
[4963.96 --> 4964.96]  with it
[4964.96 --> 4966.02]  no that's
[4966.02 --> 4966.22]  boring
[4966.22 --> 4967.66]  nothing to do
[4967.66 --> 4968.04]  with it
[4968.04 --> 4969.10]  it's just
[4969.10 --> 4969.74]  an expensive
[4969.74 --> 4970.32]  slab of
[4970.32 --> 4970.60]  metal
[4970.60 --> 4971.52]  already
[4971.52 --> 4972.00]  totally
[4972.00 --> 4972.32]  custom
[4972.32 --> 4972.64]  finished
[4972.64 --> 4973.00]  then
[4973.00 --> 4973.54]  it's a
[4973.54 --> 4973.92]  very high
[4973.92 --> 4974.08]  end
[4974.08 --> 4974.26]  phone
[4974.26 --> 4974.48]  it has
[4974.48 --> 4975.12]  a 1080p
[4975.12 --> 4975.46]  screen
[4975.46 --> 4976.38]  with 1080p
[4976.38 --> 4977.24]  4.7 inch
[4977.24 --> 4977.54]  screen
[4977.54 --> 4978.50]  which is some
[4978.50 --> 4979.56]  ludicrous
[4979.56 --> 4980.52]  pixel density
[4980.52 --> 4980.98]  like I think
[4980.98 --> 4983.00]  it's 446
[4983.00 --> 4984.46]  pixels per inch
[4984.46 --> 4984.88]  or something
[4984.88 --> 4985.64]  sort of just
[4985.64 --> 4986.42]  ridiculous like
[4986.42 --> 4986.64]  that
[4986.64 --> 4986.98]  I'll have to
[4986.98 --> 4987.40]  look it up
[4987.40 --> 4988.14]  it's in my
[4988.14 --> 4988.46]  notes
[4988.46 --> 4990.38]  it also
[4990.38 --> 4991.36]  pretty much
[4991.36 --> 4992.18]  reimagines
[4992.18 --> 4992.92]  the way that
[4992.92 --> 4993.88]  phone cameras
[4993.88 --> 4994.76]  are going to be
[4994.76 --> 4995.00]  done
[4995.00 --> 4995.84]  and I hope
[4995.84 --> 4996.44]  that this is a
[4996.44 --> 4996.66]  trend
[4996.66 --> 4997.44]  I really do
[4997.44 --> 4998.06]  there's a
[4998.06 --> 4998.70]  really interesting
[4998.70 --> 4999.50]  article actually
[4999.50 --> 5000.26]  on Enantec
[5000.26 --> 5000.70]  right now
[5000.70 --> 5001.08]  it's on the
[5001.08 --> 5001.62]  front page
[5001.62 --> 5003.26]  talking about
[5003.26 --> 5004.46]  how not
[5004.46 --> 5005.40]  only is there
[5005.40 --> 5006.12]  no benefit
[5006.12 --> 5008.80]  to this race
[5008.80 --> 5009.94]  to more megapixels
[5009.94 --> 5011.34]  particularly on
[5011.34 --> 5011.98]  phones because
[5011.98 --> 5012.58]  they're limited
[5012.58 --> 5013.72]  by how big
[5013.72 --> 5014.60]  the sensor is
[5014.60 --> 5015.42]  they're limited
[5015.42 --> 5017.34]  by how big
[5017.34 --> 5018.28]  the optical stack
[5018.28 --> 5018.74]  can be
[5018.74 --> 5019.16]  because it has
[5019.16 --> 5019.72]  to fit in a
[5019.72 --> 5020.20]  phone
[5020.20 --> 5022.40]  it may even
[5022.40 --> 5023.24]  be detrimental
[5023.24 --> 5024.56]  so having
[5024.56 --> 5025.98]  larger pixels
[5025.98 --> 5026.90]  on a CMOS
[5026.90 --> 5027.36]  sensor
[5027.36 --> 5027.96]  versus
[5027.96 --> 5029.32]  smaller pixels
[5029.32 --> 5029.88]  to actually
[5029.88 --> 5030.42]  capture the
[5030.42 --> 5030.80]  light
[5030.80 --> 5031.66]  may actually
[5031.66 --> 5032.54]  be beneficial
[5032.54 --> 5033.28]  because it'll
[5033.28 --> 5033.84]  give you
[5033.84 --> 5035.58]  more dynamic
[5035.58 --> 5036.06]  range
[5036.06 --> 5036.78]  so that is to
[5036.78 --> 5037.08]  say it'll
[5037.08 --> 5037.72]  capture more
[5037.72 --> 5038.40]  detail in the
[5038.40 --> 5038.74]  blacks
[5038.74 --> 5039.40]  and more detail
[5039.40 --> 5039.90]  in whites
[5039.90 --> 5040.82]  in the image
[5040.82 --> 5041.80]  it'll give you
[5041.80 --> 5042.54]  a crisper
[5042.54 --> 5043.06]  overall image
[5043.06 --> 5043.42]  it'll give you
[5043.42 --> 5044.08]  better low light
[5044.08 --> 5044.76]  performance in
[5044.76 --> 5045.08]  general
[5045.08 --> 5047.26]  and just
[5047.26 --> 5048.48]  is pretty much
[5048.48 --> 5048.98]  better in every
[5048.98 --> 5049.46]  possible way
[5049.46 --> 5049.96]  because we were
[5049.96 --> 5050.66]  at the point
[5050.66 --> 5051.62]  where on
[5051.62 --> 5052.72]  the sensors
[5052.72 --> 5053.92]  the tiny sensors
[5053.92 --> 5054.24]  that they're
[5054.24 --> 5054.68]  able to put
[5054.68 --> 5055.28]  in phones
[5055.28 --> 5056.76]  cramming that
[5056.76 --> 5057.22]  many pixels
[5057.22 --> 5057.74]  into it
[5057.74 --> 5058.24]  was getting
[5058.24 --> 5058.70]  to the point
[5058.70 --> 5059.16]  where the
[5059.16 --> 5059.92]  pixels weren't
[5059.92 --> 5060.44]  much bigger
[5060.44 --> 5062.06]  than the
[5062.06 --> 5063.74]  size of
[5063.74 --> 5064.22]  a light
[5064.22 --> 5064.54]  wavelength
[5064.54 --> 5067.36]  of a light
[5067.36 --> 5067.84]  what's it
[5067.84 --> 5068.08]  called
[5068.08 --> 5068.52]  help me
[5068.52 --> 5068.88]  waveform
[5068.88 --> 5069.42]  thank you
[5069.42 --> 5070.48]  you didn't
[5070.48 --> 5070.80]  say that
[5070.80 --> 5071.22]  he didn't
[5071.22 --> 5071.80]  say that
[5071.80 --> 5072.42]  but I
[5072.42 --> 5072.78]  thanked him
[5072.78 --> 5073.06]  anyway
[5073.06 --> 5073.52]  did you
[5073.52 --> 5074.52]  oh I didn't
[5074.52 --> 5075.26]  even hear you
[5075.26 --> 5076.72]  oh you didn't
[5076.72 --> 5077.10]  say it
[5077.10 --> 5079.24]  whatever
[5079.24 --> 5080.40]  so the point
[5080.40 --> 5081.00]  is that
[5081.00 --> 5081.90]  it wasn't
[5081.90 --> 5082.60]  even able
[5082.60 --> 5083.26]  necessarily
[5083.26 --> 5084.10]  to make use
[5084.10 --> 5084.78]  of all
[5084.78 --> 5085.16]  of those
[5085.16 --> 5085.56]  pixels
[5085.56 --> 5086.08]  so it was
[5086.08 --> 5086.62]  it was actually
[5086.62 --> 5087.34]  oversampling
[5087.34 --> 5087.94]  the image
[5087.94 --> 5089.28]  just because
[5089.28 --> 5089.80]  they could
[5089.80 --> 5090.32]  jam more
[5090.32 --> 5090.78]  pixels into
[5090.78 --> 5091.12]  the space
[5091.12 --> 5091.36]  there was
[5091.36 --> 5091.92]  actually no
[5091.92 --> 5093.12]  benefit
[5093.12 --> 5093.48]  from a
[5093.48 --> 5093.70]  physics
[5093.70 --> 5094.10]  standpoint
[5094.10 --> 5094.50]  the
[5094.50 --> 5094.86]  Enantec
[5094.86 --> 5095.12]  article
[5095.12 --> 5095.56]  is excellent
[5095.56 --> 5095.84]  it goes
[5095.84 --> 5096.58]  into much
[5096.58 --> 5097.20]  more detail
[5097.20 --> 5097.86]  than I'm
[5097.86 --> 5098.44]  capable of
[5098.44 --> 5098.80]  because I
[5098.80 --> 5099.18]  don't have
[5099.18 --> 5099.52]  the same
[5099.52 --> 5100.06]  kind of
[5100.06 --> 5100.70]  optical
[5100.70 --> 5101.60]  science
[5101.60 --> 5102.36]  background
[5102.36 --> 5103.02]  that the
[5103.02 --> 5103.38]  writer of
[5103.38 --> 5103.84]  that article
[5103.84 --> 5104.16]  does
[5104.16 --> 5104.88]  so do
[5104.88 --> 5105.26]  check it
[5105.26 --> 5105.38]  out
[5105.38 --> 5105.54]  it's
[5105.54 --> 5105.94]  awesome
[5105.94 --> 5107.42]  but anyway
[5107.42 --> 5108.78]  HTC is
[5108.78 --> 5109.46]  going with
[5109.46 --> 5110.50]  a lower
[5110.50 --> 5111.48]  aperture lens
[5111.48 --> 5111.96]  which is
[5111.96 --> 5112.24]  better
[5112.24 --> 5112.62]  that means
[5112.62 --> 5112.92]  it has
[5112.92 --> 5113.80]  clearer optics
[5113.80 --> 5114.52]  so it'll
[5114.52 --> 5115.00]  capture more
[5115.00 --> 5115.50]  light compared
[5115.50 --> 5116.00]  to pretty much
[5116.00 --> 5116.30]  any other
[5116.30 --> 5116.64]  phone out
[5116.64 --> 5116.76]  there
[5116.76 --> 5116.98]  so it's
[5116.98 --> 5117.90]  an f2.0
[5117.90 --> 5118.60]  they're going
[5118.60 --> 5119.44]  with larger
[5119.44 --> 5119.96]  pixels
[5119.96 --> 5120.86]  fewer larger
[5120.86 --> 5121.26]  pixels
[5121.26 --> 5122.44]  and they've
[5122.44 --> 5123.24]  added a
[5123.24 --> 5124.10]  mode that
[5124.10 --> 5124.86]  is basically
[5124.86 --> 5125.76]  kind of like
[5125.76 --> 5126.30]  taking little
[5126.30 --> 5127.14]  video snippets
[5127.14 --> 5127.84]  instead of
[5127.84 --> 5128.26]  pictures
[5128.26 --> 5129.00]  so they're
[5129.00 --> 5129.70]  calling that
[5129.70 --> 5130.32]  I don't remember
[5130.32 --> 5130.62]  what they're
[5130.62 --> 5131.08]  calling that
[5131.08 --> 5131.42]  but that
[5131.42 --> 5131.82]  sounds kind
[5131.82 --> 5132.06]  of cool
[5132.06 --> 5132.26]  too
[5132.26 --> 5132.66]  not the
[5132.66 --> 5132.88]  kind of
[5132.88 --> 5133.12]  thing I
[5133.12 --> 5133.26]  would
[5133.26 --> 5133.68]  necessarily
[5133.68 --> 5134.04]  use
[5134.04 --> 5134.22]  I'd
[5134.22 --> 5134.58]  probably go
[5134.58 --> 5135.12]  still image
[5135.12 --> 5135.88]  or I'd
[5135.88 --> 5136.18]  take a
[5136.18 --> 5136.40]  longer
[5136.40 --> 5136.70]  video
[5136.70 --> 5137.06]  if I
[5137.06 --> 5137.54]  feel like
[5137.54 --> 5137.76]  it
[5137.76 --> 5138.44]  but
[5138.44 --> 5139.22]  1080p
[5139.22 --> 5139.54]  screen
[5139.54 --> 5140.90]  468 pixels
[5140.90 --> 5141.32]  per inch
[5141.32 --> 5142.26]  200 hours
[5142.26 --> 5142.50]  on the
[5142.50 --> 5142.86]  machine
[5142.86 --> 5144.32]  game changing
[5144.32 --> 5145.50]  f2.0
[5145.50 --> 5146.10]  aperture lens
[5146.10 --> 5146.44]  and larger
[5146.44 --> 5146.88]  pixels
[5146.88 --> 5149.30]  and
[5149.30 --> 5150.48]  finally
[5150.48 --> 5151.52]  front-facing
[5151.52 --> 5152.08]  speakers
[5152.08 --> 5153.16]  why did this
[5153.16 --> 5153.58]  take so
[5153.58 --> 5153.92]  long
[5153.92 --> 5162.54]  why did
[5162.54 --> 5163.48]  take so long
[5163.48 --> 5164.16]  why does
[5164.16 --> 5165.10]  my iPad 2
[5165.10 --> 5166.02]  have one
[5166.02 --> 5167.12]  speaker on
[5167.12 --> 5167.66]  the rear
[5167.66 --> 5169.34]  bottom of
[5169.34 --> 5169.84]  the tablet
[5169.84 --> 5171.42]  why does
[5171.42 --> 5173.08]  why does
[5173.08 --> 5173.82]  this 8x
[5173.82 --> 5174.56]  phone have
[5174.56 --> 5175.30]  one speaker
[5175.30 --> 5175.76]  at the bottom
[5175.76 --> 5176.26]  of the phone
[5176.26 --> 5177.46]  do I ever
[5177.46 --> 5178.34]  watch content
[5178.34 --> 5178.76]  on it
[5178.76 --> 5179.52]  like this
[5179.52 --> 5181.52]  no
[5181.52 --> 5183.00]  does it
[5183.00 --> 5183.80]  already have
[5183.80 --> 5184.18]  a speaker
[5184.18 --> 5184.56]  on this
[5184.56 --> 5184.84]  side
[5184.84 --> 5185.92]  yes
[5185.92 --> 5187.16]  why did
[5187.16 --> 5187.52]  this take
[5187.52 --> 5187.84]  so long
[5187.84 --> 5188.12]  so they're
[5188.12 --> 5188.50]  calling it
[5188.50 --> 5189.06]  boom sound
[5189.06 --> 5189.98]  and it's
[5189.98 --> 5190.64]  different from
[5190.64 --> 5191.56]  their beats
[5191.56 --> 5192.06]  by Dre
[5192.06 --> 5192.58]  which will
[5192.58 --> 5193.12]  still be in
[5193.12 --> 5193.54]  there so
[5193.54 --> 5193.98]  or rather
[5193.98 --> 5194.60]  not by Dre
[5194.60 --> 5195.00]  anymore I
[5195.00 --> 5195.38]  don't think
[5195.38 --> 5195.84]  but their
[5195.84 --> 5196.62]  their beats
[5196.62 --> 5197.22]  audio which
[5197.22 --> 5197.74]  will still be
[5197.74 --> 5198.18]  integrated
[5198.18 --> 5198.94]  in the
[5198.94 --> 5199.48]  in the
[5199.48 --> 5199.74]  phone
[5199.74 --> 5200.12]  through the
[5200.12 --> 5200.64]  headphone jack
[5200.64 --> 5201.04]  presumably
[5201.04 --> 5201.74]  but it will
[5201.74 --> 5202.32]  actually have
[5202.32 --> 5202.64]  two
[5202.64 --> 5203.48]  front-facing
[5203.48 --> 5203.92]  speakers
[5203.92 --> 5205.04]  to work in
[5205.04 --> 5205.46]  stereo
[5205.46 --> 5206.26]  the way that
[5206.26 --> 5206.96]  sound should
[5206.96 --> 5207.14]  be
[5207.14 --> 5207.70]  because how
[5207.70 --> 5208.04]  often
[5208.04 --> 5208.56]  tell me this
[5208.56 --> 5208.78]  guys
[5208.78 --> 5209.26]  here tell
[5209.26 --> 5209.56]  me this
[5209.56 --> 5210.46]  how often
[5210.46 --> 5210.82]  have you been
[5210.82 --> 5211.56]  watching content
[5211.56 --> 5212.18]  on your phone
[5212.18 --> 5213.38]  and cupped your
[5213.38 --> 5214.14]  hand behind the
[5214.14 --> 5215.16]  phone to reflect
[5215.16 --> 5215.78]  the sound at
[5215.78 --> 5216.52]  yourself right
[5216.52 --> 5217.64]  yeah another
[5217.64 --> 5218.30]  thing that I do
[5218.30 --> 5220.24]  is I do alarms
[5220.24 --> 5220.86]  on my phone
[5220.86 --> 5221.64]  for waking up
[5221.64 --> 5222.72]  so I always have
[5222.72 --> 5223.34]  to remember to
[5223.34 --> 5224.04]  flip it upside
[5224.04 --> 5225.14]  down so that I
[5225.14 --> 5225.92]  can actually hear
[5225.92 --> 5227.94]  it because if I
[5227.94 --> 5228.84]  lay down like
[5228.84 --> 5229.38]  this it's all
[5229.38 --> 5230.12]  muffled and I'm
[5230.12 --> 5230.74]  like well okay
[5230.74 --> 5231.78]  I just missed my
[5231.78 --> 5233.44]  alarm and you're
[5233.44 --> 5234.12]  late for work
[5234.12 --> 5235.56]  which happened at
[5235.56 --> 5236.16]  least once this
[5236.16 --> 5236.68]  week I think
[5236.68 --> 5238.88]  I don't even
[5238.88 --> 5241.80]  care I worked
[5241.80 --> 5243.24]  so much over
[5243.24 --> 5245.74]  time I think
[5245.74 --> 5246.42]  what we really
[5246.42 --> 5247.18]  want to do when
[5247.18 --> 5247.86]  we're designing a
[5247.86 --> 5248.32]  phone is
[5248.32 --> 5250.84]  you know what
[5250.84 --> 5251.70]  do you want
[5251.70 --> 5252.96]  to whatever
[5252.96 --> 5254.72]  no don't worry
[5254.72 --> 5255.02]  about it
[5255.02 --> 5255.46]  no no it's
[5255.46 --> 5255.90]  okay it's okay
[5255.90 --> 5256.20]  it's okay
[5256.20 --> 5256.58]  it's okay
[5256.58 --> 5260.74]  okay so this
[5260.74 --> 5261.42]  is the video I
[5261.42 --> 5261.88]  wanted to show
[5261.88 --> 5262.92]  you guys where
[5262.92 --> 5264.12]  HTC is talking
[5264.12 --> 5265.82]  about what went
[5265.82 --> 5266.44]  into the
[5266.44 --> 5267.22]  unibody design
[5267.22 --> 5267.98]  of this particular
[5267.98 --> 5268.38]  phone
[5268.38 --> 5269.88]  so
[5269.88 --> 5276.56]  no I'm actually
[5276.56 --> 5276.96]  just going to
[5276.96 --> 5277.44]  turn him off
[5277.44 --> 5277.88]  and I'm going to
[5277.88 --> 5278.60]  talk so he's
[5278.60 --> 5279.30]  basically talking
[5279.30 --> 5280.04]  about how they
[5280.04 --> 5281.54]  want to completely
[5281.54 --> 5282.60]  change the way
[5282.60 --> 5283.44]  that phone design
[5283.44 --> 5284.32]  is done and then
[5284.32 --> 5285.24]  Jethro comes in
[5285.24 --> 5286.08]  they're kind of
[5286.08 --> 5286.72]  going for that
[5286.72 --> 5287.74]  Apple-esque approach
[5287.74 --> 5288.38]  with this video
[5288.38 --> 5290.08]  which is you know
[5290.08 --> 5290.44]  whatever
[5290.44 --> 5292.66]  I mean hey if
[5292.66 --> 5293.36]  Apple does something
[5293.36 --> 5293.90]  it's probably not
[5293.90 --> 5294.62]  necessarily okay okay
[5294.62 --> 5295.30]  okay check this out
[5295.30 --> 5295.60]  check this out
[5295.60 --> 5296.68]  so they custom
[5296.68 --> 5298.28]  designed the tools
[5298.28 --> 5299.50]  to build this phone
[5299.50 --> 5300.66]  you can see the
[5300.66 --> 5301.96]  water jets that are
[5301.96 --> 5302.72]  cooling the phone
[5302.72 --> 5303.50]  itself so it's made
[5303.50 --> 5304.26]  out of a single
[5304.26 --> 5305.58]  block of aluminum
[5305.58 --> 5306.70]  unibody design
[5306.70 --> 5307.56]  and I mean I'd
[5307.56 --> 5308.28]  like to go back
[5308.28 --> 5309.04]  to that frame
[5309.04 --> 5309.80]  there for a second
[5309.80 --> 5311.00]  because this
[5311.00 --> 5311.80]  should give you
[5311.80 --> 5312.84]  guys some idea
[5312.84 --> 5313.80]  why this takes
[5313.80 --> 5314.76]  200 hours
[5314.76 --> 5315.66]  on a machine
[5315.66 --> 5316.24]  right there
[5316.24 --> 5317.16]  it is not
[5317.16 --> 5317.38]  okay
[5317.38 --> 5318.76]  a unibody design
[5318.76 --> 5319.82]  is not
[5319.82 --> 5320.72]  as simple
[5320.72 --> 5321.54]  as
[5321.54 --> 5323.36]  come on
[5323.36 --> 5324.78]  go YouTube
[5324.78 --> 5326.76]  a unibody design
[5326.76 --> 5327.66]  is not as simple
[5327.66 --> 5328.56]  as just taking a
[5328.56 --> 5329.18]  brick of aluminum
[5329.18 --> 5330.30]  and like hollowing
[5330.30 --> 5330.64]  it out
[5330.64 --> 5331.72]  they have to
[5331.72 --> 5332.48]  actually build a
[5332.48 --> 5332.86]  chassis
[5332.86 --> 5333.66]  that they can
[5333.66 --> 5334.68]  mount a whole bunch
[5334.68 --> 5335.26]  of stuff in
[5335.26 --> 5336.52]  and I mean if
[5336.52 --> 5337.38]  one mistake gets
[5337.38 --> 5338.10]  made it gets
[5338.10 --> 5338.94]  thrown away
[5338.94 --> 5340.32]  and aluminum's
[5340.32 --> 5340.84]  not cheap
[5340.84 --> 5341.82]  and and and
[5341.82 --> 5342.48]  all this stuff
[5342.48 --> 5343.38]  the complexity
[5343.38 --> 5343.96]  that goes into
[5343.96 --> 5344.50]  this is just
[5344.50 --> 5345.00]  outstanding
[5345.00 --> 5346.08]  I'm really looking
[5346.08 --> 5346.54]  forward to getting
[5346.54 --> 5347.18]  my hands on one
[5347.18 --> 5347.48]  of these
[5347.48 --> 5348.20]  the weight of it
[5348.20 --> 5348.54]  will probably
[5348.54 --> 5349.34]  feel really nice
[5349.34 --> 5351.10]  I love the weight
[5351.10 --> 5352.14]  of like the iPhone 4
[5352.14 --> 5352.90]  like I like heavy
[5352.90 --> 5353.88]  phones so I'm
[5353.88 --> 5354.48]  super excited
[5354.48 --> 5355.00]  about this
[5355.00 --> 5355.64]  that's one thing
[5355.64 --> 5356.56]  actually randomly
[5356.56 --> 5357.18]  enough I liked
[5357.18 --> 5357.72]  about the Titan
[5357.72 --> 5358.96]  it actually feels
[5358.96 --> 5359.36]  like something
[5359.36 --> 5359.88]  when you pick it
[5359.88 --> 5360.06]  up
[5360.06 --> 5361.22]  so here he says
[5361.22 --> 5361.94]  some other random
[5361.94 --> 5362.42]  junk here
[5362.42 --> 5362.98]  ah yes
[5362.98 --> 5363.84]  so this is a
[5363.84 --> 5364.62]  custom process
[5364.62 --> 5365.20]  that they
[5365.20 --> 5366.04]  that they used
[5366.04 --> 5367.04]  to get the back
[5367.04 --> 5367.94]  of it to be
[5367.94 --> 5368.70]  in a very sort
[5368.70 --> 5369.24]  of natural
[5369.24 --> 5369.98]  curvature
[5369.98 --> 5370.96]  sort of shape
[5370.96 --> 5371.62]  here they're
[5371.62 --> 5372.00]  showing some
[5372.00 --> 5372.42]  of the final
[5372.42 --> 5373.16]  finishing on the
[5373.16 --> 5373.46]  phone
[5373.46 --> 5375.10]  so spec
[5375.10 --> 5375.98]  spec is
[5375.98 --> 5377.56]  fine details
[5377.56 --> 5378.50]  diamond cut
[5378.50 --> 5379.06]  edges
[5379.06 --> 5380.08]  so spec is
[5380.08 --> 5380.48]  fine and
[5380.48 --> 5380.84]  interesting
[5380.84 --> 5381.44]  and all that
[5381.44 --> 5382.62]  but this
[5382.62 --> 5383.68]  is a truly
[5383.68 --> 5384.58]  premium device
[5384.58 --> 5384.94]  that I'm
[5384.94 --> 5385.36]  really really
[5385.36 --> 5385.92]  excited about
[5385.92 --> 5386.64]  and this is
[5386.64 --> 5387.12]  actually
[5387.12 --> 5387.88]  I don't know
[5387.88 --> 5388.34]  if I've even
[5388.34 --> 5388.90]  told Slick
[5388.90 --> 5389.32]  this yet
[5389.32 --> 5389.88]  okay I'm done
[5389.88 --> 5390.28]  watching this
[5390.28 --> 5390.68]  video now
[5390.68 --> 5392.82]  this is
[5392.82 --> 5393.44]  actually
[5393.44 --> 5394.62]  the phone
[5394.62 --> 5395.06]  that I'll
[5395.06 --> 5395.54]  be using
[5395.54 --> 5396.04]  for my
[5396.04 --> 5396.46]  30 day
[5396.46 --> 5396.74]  Android
[5396.74 --> 5397.12]  trial
[5397.12 --> 5398.12]  you did
[5398.12 --> 5398.84]  did I tell you
[5398.84 --> 5399.06]  this
[5399.06 --> 5399.52]  okay so
[5399.52 --> 5400.20]  I am going
[5400.20 --> 5400.74]  to do
[5400.74 --> 5401.76]  a 30 day
[5401.76 --> 5402.56]  I switched
[5402.56 --> 5403.94]  I think I'm
[5403.94 --> 5404.32]  done with
[5404.32 --> 5405.08]  Windows Phone 8
[5405.08 --> 5405.96]  one thing that I'll
[5405.96 --> 5406.60]  be doing at the
[5406.60 --> 5407.56]  end of my 30 days
[5407.56 --> 5408.36]  with Windows Phone 8
[5408.36 --> 5409.04]  is I will be giving
[5409.04 --> 5410.52]  my HTC 8X
[5410.52 --> 5411.88]  away to someone
[5411.88 --> 5412.42]  in the audience
[5412.42 --> 5413.16]  so we'll either
[5413.16 --> 5413.74]  do that on a
[5413.74 --> 5414.18]  live stream
[5414.18 --> 5415.16]  or we'll do
[5415.16 --> 5415.74]  that you know
[5415.74 --> 5416.10]  what let's do
[5416.10 --> 5416.36]  it on the
[5416.36 --> 5416.78]  live stream
[5416.78 --> 5417.94]  let's make
[5417.94 --> 5419.06]  all 200 people
[5419.06 --> 5419.56]  who have tuned
[5419.56 --> 5420.24]  out since we
[5420.24 --> 5420.90]  since we were
[5420.90 --> 5421.44]  at our peak
[5421.44 --> 5422.46]  regret not
[5422.46 --> 5423.14]  listening to it
[5423.14 --> 5423.38]  we're going to do it right now
[5423.38 --> 5424.58]  no no we're not going to do it now
[5424.58 --> 5425.12]  oh okay
[5425.12 --> 5426.36]  but I'm going to give it away
[5426.36 --> 5426.94]  on the live stream
[5426.94 --> 5428.02]  I'm sorry it won't be a
[5428.02 --> 5428.58]  brand new one
[5428.58 --> 5429.86]  it'll be exactly this one
[5429.86 --> 5430.12]  but
[5430.12 --> 5430.72]  which is just like
[5430.72 --> 5431.76]  slapped against his hand
[5431.76 --> 5432.06]  yeah
[5432.06 --> 5432.38]  like
[5432.38 --> 5434.70]  you looking forward
[5434.70 --> 5435.16]  to using this
[5435.16 --> 5436.78]  don't worry it's okay
[5436.78 --> 5437.66]  it's all solid state
[5437.66 --> 5438.44]  so I'm not actually
[5438.44 --> 5438.88]  wrecking it
[5438.88 --> 5439.74]  there's a couple
[5439.74 --> 5441.02]  micro scratches on the screen
[5441.02 --> 5441.70]  but overall it's in
[5441.70 --> 5442.54]  really really good shape
[5442.54 --> 5443.50]  so yeah
[5443.50 --> 5444.30]  one lucky viewer
[5444.30 --> 5444.96]  will get my
[5444.96 --> 5445.74]  8X
[5445.74 --> 5446.94]  and then I'm going
[5446.94 --> 5447.50]  to move on
[5447.50 --> 5448.44]  I'm going to use
[5448.44 --> 5449.26]  an HTC One
[5449.26 --> 5450.14]  for 30 days
[5450.14 --> 5451.62]  and see if Android
[5451.62 --> 5452.46]  can win me over
[5452.46 --> 5453.34]  however
[5453.34 --> 5454.30]  however
[5454.30 --> 5455.90]  wipe that smirk
[5455.90 --> 5456.36]  off your face
[5456.36 --> 5457.18]  it's not necessarily
[5457.18 --> 5457.60]  going to be
[5457.60 --> 5458.32]  what I stick with
[5458.32 --> 5459.58]  however
[5459.58 --> 5461.52]  I did spend some time
[5461.52 --> 5462.52]  on the
[5462.52 --> 5463.44]  on the One S
[5463.44 --> 5464.02]  just kind of
[5464.02 --> 5464.88]  dinking around with it
[5464.88 --> 5465.36]  and I'm
[5465.36 --> 5466.60]  still not sold
[5466.60 --> 5467.18]  on Android
[5467.18 --> 5468.18]  so we'll see
[5468.18 --> 5468.60]  you're using some
[5468.60 --> 5469.02]  like
[5469.02 --> 5470.76]  go back to default
[5470.76 --> 5472.28]  don't use their
[5472.28 --> 5472.76]  crappy
[5472.76 --> 5473.76]  terrible of S
[5473.76 --> 5474.48]  well
[5474.48 --> 5475.12]  you know what
[5475.12 --> 5476.34]  Sense 4.0 Plus
[5476.34 --> 5476.96]  actually has
[5476.96 --> 5477.34]  some pretty
[5477.34 --> 5478.22]  positive reviews
[5478.22 --> 5479.86]  you don't like it
[5479.86 --> 5480.36]  how much time
[5480.36 --> 5480.68]  have you spent
[5480.68 --> 5481.02]  with it
[5481.02 --> 5481.44]  a bit
[5481.44 --> 5482.38]  okay
[5482.38 --> 5482.84]  well
[5482.84 --> 5483.82]  okay whatever
[5483.82 --> 5484.62]  I'll be trying it
[5484.62 --> 5486.24]  so I will be able
[5486.24 --> 5486.64]  to formulate
[5486.64 --> 5487.74]  an actual opinion
[5487.74 --> 5488.36]  because I'll
[5488.36 --> 5489.16]  actually spend
[5489.16 --> 5489.96]  some time with it
[5489.96 --> 5491.02]  but yeah
[5491.02 --> 5491.72]  we'll go from there
[5491.72 --> 5492.38]  or you could
[5492.38 --> 5493.28]  actually install
[5493.28 --> 5493.92]  something real
[5493.92 --> 5495.58]  and be an actual
[5495.58 --> 5496.32]  Android user
[5496.32 --> 5497.18]  and actually
[5497.18 --> 5498.56]  use and mod
[5498.56 --> 5499.06]  your phone
[5499.06 --> 5502.04]  I'm surprisingly
[5502.04 --> 5502.68]  okay with being
[5502.68 --> 5503.22]  fired at this point
[5503.22 --> 5503.74]  not every
[5503.74 --> 5505.16]  not every Android
[5505.16 --> 5506.36]  user like
[5506.36 --> 5507.12]  roots their phone
[5507.12 --> 5507.46]  and stuff
[5507.46 --> 5507.98]  I'm not saying
[5507.98 --> 5508.50]  root your phone
[5508.50 --> 5509.96]  just change things
[5509.96 --> 5510.54]  okay why don't you
[5510.54 --> 5511.46]  handle the Windows 8
[5511.46 --> 5512.42]  Pro giveaway
[5512.42 --> 5513.76]  I think that'll
[5513.76 --> 5514.60]  probably be pretty much
[5514.60 --> 5514.76]  it
[5514.76 --> 5515.72]  oh we haven't done
[5515.72 --> 5516.48]  we haven't done our
[5516.48 --> 5517.62]  featured build of the week
[5517.62 --> 5518.26]  right
[5518.26 --> 5520.38]  so featured build of the week
[5520.38 --> 5521.96]  from the Linus Tech Tips
[5521.96 --> 5522.36]  forum
[5522.36 --> 5523.30]  is
[5523.30 --> 5524.72]  drumroll
[5524.72 --> 5525.84]  I'm excited
[5525.84 --> 5526.64]  because I've been
[5526.64 --> 5527.48]  totally offline
[5527.48 --> 5529.70]  I think this one's a bit
[5529.70 --> 5530.48]  of an older thread
[5530.48 --> 5531.98]  so here let me just
[5531.98 --> 5533.28]  my hotkeys aren't working
[5533.28 --> 5534.24]  for Twitch
[5534.24 --> 5536.68]  so this is a build
[5536.68 --> 5539.16]  by Gecko
[5539.16 --> 5541.28]  called creatively
[5541.28 --> 5543.98]  my main gaming system
[5543.98 --> 5546.72]  go Gecko
[5546.72 --> 5550.50]  I don't know if anyone
[5550.50 --> 5551.78]  actually ever posted pictures
[5551.78 --> 5552.72]  in the thread itself
[5552.72 --> 5554.82]  but he's got a bunch of pictures
[5554.82 --> 5556.68]  posted I mean look at the way
[5556.68 --> 5557.78]  he's done the management
[5557.78 --> 5559.12]  behind the motherboard tray
[5559.12 --> 5560.92]  I mean yeah
[5560.92 --> 5561.80]  that is freaking
[5561.80 --> 5563.28]  boss
[5563.28 --> 5564.10]  that's awesome
[5564.10 --> 5565.18]  it's not copper tubing
[5565.18 --> 5565.64]  no
[5565.64 --> 5567.32]  but I still love it anyway
[5567.32 --> 5568.34]  because it's just
[5568.34 --> 5570.50]  oh it's just freaking awesome
[5570.50 --> 5572.00]  so you can see he actually
[5572.00 --> 5572.98]  these pictures
[5572.98 --> 5574.36]  sort of go throughout
[5574.36 --> 5575.52]  the building process
[5575.52 --> 5576.48]  so he colors it black
[5576.48 --> 5577.26]  so it looks
[5577.26 --> 5578.42]  it looks really pro
[5578.42 --> 5579.88]  even though it's
[5579.88 --> 5581.58]  it looks like just PVC joints
[5581.58 --> 5584.00]  which I just think is really cool
[5584.00 --> 5585.30]  like actual plumbing stuff
[5585.30 --> 5586.22]  in a computer
[5586.22 --> 5587.32]  sort of
[5587.32 --> 5588.94]  gets me pretty excited
[5588.94 --> 5590.66]  so it's in a Cosmos 2
[5590.66 --> 5593.84]  it's got a Rampage 4 Extreme
[5593.84 --> 5594.26]  in there
[5594.26 --> 5595.02]  so very high in build
[5595.02 --> 5595.54]  and
[5595.54 --> 5597.06]  what I like about this build
[5597.06 --> 5597.98]  in addition to all that
[5597.98 --> 5599.44]  is check out those fans
[5599.44 --> 5601.16]  Noctua baby
[5601.16 --> 5603.60]  not every beautiful build
[5603.60 --> 5604.78]  cannot
[5604.78 --> 5605.34]  or
[5605.34 --> 5605.86]  okay
[5605.86 --> 5607.20]  some beautiful builds
[5607.20 --> 5608.30]  can incorporate
[5608.30 --> 5609.50]  Noctua colors
[5609.50 --> 5610.14]  in spite of their
[5610.14 --> 5611.64]  in spite of their color schemes
[5611.64 --> 5613.24]  I wasn't able to do it
[5613.24 --> 5613.60]  but
[5613.60 --> 5615.92]  big kudos to Gecko
[5615.92 --> 5617.18]  for making it work
[5617.18 --> 5618.30]  because that works
[5618.30 --> 5619.80]  I would love to see
[5619.80 --> 5621.28]  not that it's bad
[5621.28 --> 5621.92]  in any way
[5621.92 --> 5623.00]  but I would love to see
[5623.00 --> 5624.56]  the Noctua dye mod
[5624.56 --> 5626.16]  that a whole bunch of people posted
[5626.16 --> 5626.58]  yeah
[5626.58 --> 5627.08]  me too
[5627.08 --> 5628.08]  that would be very cool
[5628.08 --> 5629.54]  so there you go
[5629.54 --> 5630.28]  more Noctuas
[5630.28 --> 5630.64]  you know what
[5630.64 --> 5631.60]  their newer color scheme
[5631.60 --> 5632.42]  looks better than some
[5632.42 --> 5633.10]  of the older fans
[5633.10 --> 5633.82]  where it's more of a
[5633.82 --> 5634.30]  reddy brown
[5634.30 --> 5634.62]  yeah
[5634.62 --> 5636.26]  the actual brown brown
[5636.26 --> 5637.36]  looks pretty good
[5637.36 --> 5637.54]  yeah
[5637.54 --> 5638.66]  so here it is
[5638.66 --> 5639.44]  getting built up
[5639.44 --> 5640.08]  check out those
[5640.08 --> 5641.30]  individually sleeve cables
[5641.30 --> 5642.64]  looks gorgeous
[5642.64 --> 5644.10]  Corsair Dominators
[5644.10 --> 5644.76]  in there
[5644.76 --> 5645.48]  beast
[5645.48 --> 5646.52]  very very beast
[5646.52 --> 5647.78]  Asus DirectCU
[5647.78 --> 5648.78]  graphics card
[5648.78 --> 5649.72]  just
[5649.72 --> 5650.42]  just a
[5650.42 --> 5651.26]  just a beautiful
[5651.26 --> 5651.80]  beautiful
[5651.80 --> 5652.96]  beautiful machine
[5652.96 --> 5653.38]  yeah
[5653.38 --> 5654.16]  if you did like
[5654.16 --> 5654.54]  red
[5654.54 --> 5655.46]  red blades
[5655.46 --> 5656.36]  of the black housing
[5656.36 --> 5657.02]  yeah
[5657.02 --> 5657.64]  to go along
[5657.64 --> 5658.34]  with the rest of your build
[5658.34 --> 5659.02]  that would look
[5659.02 --> 5660.26]  really really good
[5660.26 --> 5660.96]  I mean
[5660.96 --> 5661.86]  oh you know what
[5661.86 --> 5662.52]  I actually
[5662.52 --> 5663.70]  I actually made a mistake
[5663.70 --> 5664.28]  I called those
[5664.28 --> 5665.08]  water cooling tubing
[5665.08 --> 5666.30]  tubes at the beginning
[5666.30 --> 5666.96]  I think they were just
[5666.96 --> 5667.70]  for cable management
[5667.70 --> 5667.90]  yeah
[5667.90 --> 5669.72]  so yeah
[5669.72 --> 5670.44]  just gorgeous
[5670.44 --> 5671.28]  cable management
[5671.28 --> 5671.96]  just using
[5671.96 --> 5672.20]  you know
[5672.20 --> 5672.54]  simple
[5672.54 --> 5673.58]  Corsair H100
[5673.58 --> 5674.02]  you know
[5674.02 --> 5675.24]  not going over the top
[5675.24 --> 5675.80]  necessarily
[5675.80 --> 5676.74]  in terms of the cooling
[5676.74 --> 5677.58]  or anything like that
[5677.58 --> 5677.98]  but
[5677.98 --> 5679.10]  nice
[5679.10 --> 5679.84]  beautiful
[5679.84 --> 5680.94]  premium components
[5680.94 --> 5682.40]  just gorgeous
[5682.40 --> 5683.34]  gorgeous build
[5683.34 --> 5684.52]  AX1200
[5684.52 --> 5685.20]  great choice
[5685.20 --> 5686.06]  for the power supply
[5686.06 --> 5686.70]  is he going to be
[5686.70 --> 5687.36]  running an extension
[5687.36 --> 5688.04]  for the sound card
[5688.04 --> 5690.54]  I'm not sure
[5690.54 --> 5691.04]  what he's doing
[5691.04 --> 5692.06]  apparently
[5692.06 --> 5692.96]  drunken madness
[5692.96 --> 5693.40]  I don't think
[5693.40 --> 5693.92]  I ever actually
[5693.92 --> 5694.78]  checked the last
[5694.78 --> 5695.48]  the last one
[5695.48 --> 5697.08]  so there's his setup
[5697.08 --> 5699.80]  but yeah
[5699.80 --> 5701.08]  awesome build
[5701.08 --> 5702.66]  absolutely love it
[5702.66 --> 5703.64]  looks beautiful
[5703.64 --> 5705.28]  and very very very
[5705.28 --> 5705.86]  tastefully done
[5705.86 --> 5706.60]  I'm sure he's got a bridge
[5706.60 --> 5707.08]  or an extension
[5707.08 --> 5708.26]  or something for that sound card
[5708.26 --> 5709.04]  so guys
[5709.04 --> 5710.86]  do feel free
[5710.86 --> 5712.08]  to post your builds
[5712.08 --> 5713.12]  make sure they're awesome
[5713.12 --> 5713.90]  I mean if you're going to have
[5713.90 --> 5714.78]  a chance of being featured
[5714.78 --> 5715.40]  on the live stream
[5715.40 --> 5716.44]  but do feel free
[5716.44 --> 5717.38]  to post your builds
[5717.38 --> 5719.02]  in the build blog section
[5719.02 --> 5720.36]  of the Linus Tech Tips forum
[5720.36 --> 5722.02]  and we're going to do
[5722.02 --> 5722.86]  weekly features
[5722.86 --> 5723.86]  of builds
[5723.86 --> 5724.68]  from that section
[5724.68 --> 5725.38]  just because
[5725.38 --> 5726.76]  we'd love to see you guys
[5726.76 --> 5727.68]  get a little bit
[5727.68 --> 5728.28]  more attention
[5728.28 --> 5728.94]  with all the work
[5728.94 --> 5729.92]  you put into your computers
[5729.92 --> 5730.60]  and have people
[5730.60 --> 5731.16]  check them out
[5731.16 --> 5732.14]  so congratulations
[5732.14 --> 5732.92]  to Gecko
[5732.92 --> 5733.64]  for getting chosen
[5733.64 --> 5734.14]  this week
[5734.14 --> 5735.16]  Slick's going to handle
[5735.16 --> 5736.00]  the live stream question
[5736.00 --> 5736.82]  while I go get a copy
[5736.82 --> 5737.30]  of Windows 8
[5737.30 --> 5737.74]  to give away
[5737.74 --> 5738.66]  okay
[5738.66 --> 5739.80]  which one did you want to do
[5739.80 --> 5740.94]  I don't know
[5740.94 --> 5741.70]  try the first one
[5741.70 --> 5742.90]  see if anyone can get it
[5742.90 --> 5743.34]  okay
[5743.34 --> 5745.22]  okay
[5745.22 --> 5746.36]  so let me bring up
[5746.36 --> 5747.92]  Twitter here real quick
[5747.92 --> 5749.36]  and change the theme
[5749.36 --> 5750.16]  which I don't even remember
[5750.16 --> 5750.96]  how to do
[5750.96 --> 5756.02]  what's even going on
[5756.02 --> 5756.56]  right now
[5756.56 --> 5758.58]  sorry guys
[5758.58 --> 5759.96]  I am not good at this
[5759.96 --> 5766.18]  that is not working at all
[5766.18 --> 5766.74]  anyways
[5766.74 --> 5767.62]  the question is
[5767.62 --> 5768.94]  what is the first video
[5768.94 --> 5770.04]  that I filmed
[5770.04 --> 5772.86]  for Linus Tech Tips
[5772.86 --> 5774.96]  first video that I filmed
[5774.96 --> 5775.84]  for Linus Tech Tips
[5775.84 --> 5779.94]  how does he
[5779.94 --> 5782.96]  sorry guys
[5782.96 --> 5783.62]  one second
[5783.62 --> 5790.70]  alright
[5790.70 --> 5793.44]  is it
[5793.44 --> 5794.58]  oh I probably haven't
[5794.58 --> 5795.40]  refreshed it on that one
[5795.40 --> 5795.80]  or something
[5795.80 --> 5798.06]  what do you mean
[5798.06 --> 5798.62]  it's LeBroque
[5798.62 --> 5798.98]  what do you mean
[5798.98 --> 5799.62]  refreshed it
[5799.62 --> 5800.80]  the card
[5800.80 --> 5802.08]  oh no no no
[5802.08 --> 5803.62]  the positioning for Twitter
[5803.62 --> 5805.34]  whatever man
[5805.34 --> 5806.06]  oh well no
[5806.06 --> 5806.56]  it's this
[5806.56 --> 5807.86]  there's your problem
[5807.86 --> 5808.94]  you probably refreshed
[5808.94 --> 5809.80]  the page instead of
[5809.80 --> 5810.80]  just pressing new interactions
[5810.80 --> 5812.20]  no it was just full screen
[5812.20 --> 5813.28]  you're like right under the mic
[5813.28 --> 5813.90]  oh sorry
[5813.90 --> 5816.20]  as much as they love
[5816.20 --> 5817.00]  usually we have it mounted
[5817.00 --> 5817.52]  on the camera
[5817.52 --> 5818.38]  so I'm not used to it yet
[5818.38 --> 5818.82]  yeah I know
[5818.82 --> 5820.18]  but I think they were saying
[5820.18 --> 5821.00]  the audio was like
[5821.00 --> 5822.00]  fracking awesome
[5822.00 --> 5822.52]  sweet
[5822.52 --> 5823.66]  because having it close to us
[5823.66 --> 5824.52]  like this should actually
[5824.52 --> 5825.40]  be a major improvement
[5825.40 --> 5825.82]  cool
[5825.82 --> 5828.78]  I asked it
[5828.78 --> 5829.76]  so check new interactions
[5829.76 --> 5831.20]  see if anyone has
[5831.20 --> 5831.90]  actually got it
[5831.90 --> 5832.70]  alright
[5832.70 --> 5833.62]  someone asks
[5833.62 --> 5835.02]  what GPU should I get
[5835.02 --> 5837.16]  anything around a thousand dollars
[5837.16 --> 5837.60]  is good
[5837.60 --> 5838.40]  holy
[5838.40 --> 5840.24]  pick up three 660TIs
[5840.24 --> 5841.00]  there
[5841.00 --> 5841.96]  or two
[5841.96 --> 5843.24]  and buy some games
[5843.24 --> 5843.88]  just get two
[5843.88 --> 5845.88]  actually 660TIs
[5845.88 --> 5846.44]  is a really good choice
[5846.44 --> 5847.74]  spend some money on some games man
[5847.74 --> 5850.74]  the unboxing of that one motherboard
[5850.74 --> 5852.18]  what was the question again
[5852.18 --> 5855.64]  the unboxing of that one MOBO
[5855.64 --> 5857.92]  no
[5857.92 --> 5858.96]  it was
[5858.96 --> 5860.00]  what was the first video
[5860.00 --> 5860.66]  that I filmed
[5860.66 --> 5861.50]  ah
[5861.50 --> 5862.38]  yes
[5862.38 --> 5864.04]  okay
[5864.04 --> 5865.18]  so this is tough
[5865.18 --> 5866.88]  because the only way to know
[5866.88 --> 5868.14]  which one it was
[5868.14 --> 5870.36]  was to hear me say
[5870.36 --> 5871.24]  that
[5871.24 --> 5872.12]  oh you know what
[5872.12 --> 5872.74]  I did a few
[5872.74 --> 5873.90]  where I said I was interviewing
[5873.90 --> 5875.70]  you didn't post any of them
[5875.70 --> 5876.22]  except for mine
[5876.22 --> 5876.64]  yes I did
[5876.64 --> 5877.56]  I posted them all
[5877.56 --> 5879.00]  I don't think so
[5879.00 --> 5879.40]  oh I did
[5879.40 --> 5880.46]  unless it was after I was
[5880.46 --> 5881.28]  I wouldn't have wasted
[5881.28 --> 5882.52]  unless it was after I was hired
[5882.52 --> 5883.58]  yeah it was after you were
[5883.58 --> 5883.98]  oh okay
[5883.98 --> 5884.58]  it was after you were hired
[5884.58 --> 5885.86]  so this is almost going to be
[5885.86 --> 5886.70]  a bit of a crapshoot
[5886.70 --> 5887.92]  um
[5887.92 --> 5889.44]  so whoever gets it right
[5889.44 --> 5890.28]  so there's ones
[5890.28 --> 5892.08]  where I basically said
[5892.08 --> 5893.10]  ah
[5893.10 --> 5894.12]  that I was in the video
[5894.12 --> 5895.22]  yeah
[5895.22 --> 5896.52]  that I had someone
[5896.52 --> 5897.36]  who was applying
[5897.36 --> 5898.78]  to be my new assistant
[5898.78 --> 5899.68]  filming it
[5899.68 --> 5901.06]  it was one of those ones
[5901.06 --> 5901.84]  it was not
[5901.84 --> 5903.18]  slick soil cooled PC
[5903.18 --> 5904.74]  it was not personal grooming
[5904.74 --> 5905.66]  with the USB shaver
[5905.66 --> 5906.88]  that was a long time ago
[5906.88 --> 5908.38]  um
[5908.38 --> 5908.88]  not
[5908.88 --> 5909.70]  Zybel 60
[5909.70 --> 5911.36]  I don't think anyone's going to get it
[5911.36 --> 5912.64]  I don't think anyone's going to get it either
[5912.64 --> 5913.56]  that's really hard
[5913.56 --> 5914.08]  I know
[5914.08 --> 5915.86]  um
[5915.86 --> 5916.76]  I just
[5916.76 --> 5917.62]  usually we post stuff
[5917.62 --> 5918.46]  that's so easy
[5918.46 --> 5919.70]  whoa
[5919.70 --> 5924.06]  that was it right
[5924.06 --> 5926.12]  no
[5926.12 --> 5926.80]  wasn't it
[5926.80 --> 5927.32]  no
[5927.32 --> 5928.52]  what was the first one you filmed
[5928.52 --> 5931.00]  oh
[5931.00 --> 5932.62]  oh
[5932.62 --> 5934.10]  really close
[5934.10 --> 5935.46]  I'll say that much
[5935.46 --> 5936.96]  so now someone will get it for sure
[5936.96 --> 5937.46]  bam
[5937.46 --> 5938.10]  oh
[5938.10 --> 5939.06]  whoa whoa whoa
[5939.06 --> 5939.74]  there we go
[5939.74 --> 5940.40]  there we go
[5940.40 --> 5941.16]  let's go down a little bit
[5941.16 --> 5941.66]  let's go down a little bit
[5941.66 --> 5943.00]  let's make sure someone else didn't get it
[5943.00 --> 5944.78]  oh
[5944.78 --> 5945.56]  looks like it
[5945.56 --> 5945.98]  he's
[5945.98 --> 5947.16]  oh he's close
[5947.16 --> 5949.00]  what's a Levitron clicker
[5949.00 --> 5951.18]  like he must have meant mechanical keyboard
[5951.18 --> 5952.18]  and like that's very
[5952.18 --> 5954.98]  that looks very specifically copied from a title
[5954.98 --> 5956.04]  yeah sorry man
[5956.04 --> 5956.56]  I don't
[5956.56 --> 5957.78]  I don't think you got it though
[5957.78 --> 5958.64]  it looks like
[5958.64 --> 5959.72]  Jacob
[5959.72 --> 5962.26]  is the big winner
[5962.26 --> 5963.30]  hopefully we're not wrong
[5963.30 --> 5964.46]  and clicker isn't just like
[5964.46 --> 5966.38]  the proper name for a mech 4 or something
[5966.38 --> 5968.06]  I really don't think it is
[5968.06 --> 5968.44]  it's not
[5968.44 --> 5968.46]  it's not
[5968.46 --> 5969.74]  yeah it was the
[5969.74 --> 5972.68]  ASIO Levitron Mech 4 unboxing
[5972.68 --> 5974.50]  so congratulations
[5974.50 --> 5977.30]  this is a copy of Windows Pro
[5977.30 --> 5978.40]  Windows 8 Pro
[5978.40 --> 5979.66]  that I won at CES
[5979.66 --> 5980.68]  at some event
[5980.68 --> 5982.90]  so I will send you the key
[5982.90 --> 5985.84]  hopefully there's a way for you to use the key
[5985.84 --> 5987.08]  careful with the key
[5987.08 --> 5988.24]  don't show it to the stream
[5988.24 --> 5989.44]  there's the key
[5989.44 --> 5990.34]  oh it's not the key actually
[5990.34 --> 5992.62]  so I'm going to follow you on Twitter
[5992.62 --> 5993.84]  so go ahead
[5993.84 --> 5995.00]  make sure you're following me
[5995.00 --> 5996.80]  send me a direct message
[5996.80 --> 5998.88]  to claim your prize
[5998.88 --> 5999.74]  that was tough
[5999.74 --> 6001.58]  I'm impressed that he got it
[6001.58 --> 6002.48]  I'm really impressed
[6002.48 --> 6005.06]  I was fully expecting to need to go to our second question
[6005.06 --> 6005.58]  yep
[6005.58 --> 6005.96]  nope
[6005.96 --> 6009.16]  I'm super super impressed
[6009.16 --> 6010.82]  not only is that old now
[6010.82 --> 6011.58]  yeah ancient
[6011.58 --> 6012.76]  that was like a year ago
[6012.76 --> 6013.16]  yeah
[6013.16 --> 6016.22]  and that was like not a really big thing really
[6016.22 --> 6016.70]  nope
[6016.70 --> 6019.28]  it was just like quickly mentioned at the beginning or end of the video
[6019.28 --> 6019.72]  yep
[6019.72 --> 6020.44]  awesome
[6020.44 --> 6021.50]  okay
[6021.50 --> 6023.90]  do we have anything else that you wanted to cover on the live stream
[6023.90 --> 6025.50]  I think we're getting pretty late here
[6025.50 --> 6025.98]  oh my goodness
[6025.98 --> 6026.60]  it's almost 11
[6026.60 --> 6027.00]  okay
[6027.00 --> 6027.76]  yeah we should go
[6027.76 --> 6030.40]  goodnight everyone
[6030.40 --> 6031.16]  goodnight
[6031.16 --> 6032.32]  we should move that
[6032.32 --> 6033.46]  so that it's closer to the lens
[6033.46 --> 6035.34]  so at least we're not just like blatantly staring
[6035.34 --> 6035.96]  like off camera
[6035.96 --> 6037.20]  it wasn't that bad before either
[6037.20 --> 6038.10]  yeah
[6038.10 --> 6039.50]  it wasn't that far off
[6039.50 --> 6040.44]  even though it seems closer
[6040.44 --> 6041.54]  it wasn't that far off
[6041.54 --> 6042.10]  no
[6042.10 --> 6044.56]  I think it helps that it was closer to us
[6044.56 --> 6045.10]  so
[6045.10 --> 6046.08]  yeah
[6046.08 --> 6046.54]  I don't know
[6046.54 --> 6047.82]  I think the mic was a good idea
[6047.82 --> 6049.08]  but we need to fix this thing
[6049.08 --> 6049.52]  well
[6049.52 --> 6050.70]  this is just where it was
[6050.70 --> 6051.88]  because we moved it out of the way
[6051.88 --> 6054.18]  when we were filming all the Titan stuff
[6054.18 --> 6056.48]  because we were walking back and forth across the room
[6056.48 --> 6056.80]  yeah
[6056.80 --> 6058.36]  it makes sense
[6058.36 --> 6059.90]  yeah
[6059.90 --> 6064.44]  how was dinner?
[6064.98 --> 6066.34]  I didn't eat yet
[6066.34 --> 6067.04]  you didn't eat yet?
[6067.08 --> 6067.26]  no
[6067.26 --> 6068.72]  oh did you end up sleeping?
[6069.18 --> 6069.46]  yeah
[6069.46 --> 6070.00]  oh
[6070.00 --> 6073.50]  the reason why I wasn't on the live stream when we first got back
[6073.50 --> 6075.46]  was I had a brutal splitting headache
[6075.46 --> 6076.06]  so
[6076.06 --> 6078.24]  I crashed for a bit
[6078.24 --> 6078.88]  set an alarm
[6078.88 --> 6081.10]  but apparently I just slept right through my alarm
[6081.10 --> 6082.32]  well you slept through that
[6082.32 --> 6082.66]  and
[6082.66 --> 6082.78]  and
[6082.78 --> 6084.30]  and then you slept through my 10 minutes
[6084.30 --> 6086.14]  10 minutes to live stream warning
[6086.14 --> 6088.04]  and then you slept through my
[6088.04 --> 6088.64]  um
[6088.64 --> 6089.16]  no
[6089.16 --> 6091.14]  I came in and said
[6091.14 --> 6091.60]  hey
[6091.60 --> 6092.28]  uh
[6092.28 --> 6093.54]  we've been live for
[6093.54 --> 6094.10]  we were
[6094.10 --> 6094.36]  oh no
[6094.36 --> 6094.76]  no
[6094.76 --> 6095.16]  no no
[6095.16 --> 6096.04]  10 minutes before
[6096.04 --> 6098.26]  and then I was a little bit late launching the live stream
[6098.26 --> 6099.04]  like 7 minutes
[6099.04 --> 6099.78]  and I was like
[6099.78 --> 6099.96]  hey
[6099.96 --> 6101.40]  we were supposed to be live 7 minutes ago
[6101.40 --> 6102.90]  get your butt in gear
[6102.90 --> 6103.96]  and then
[6103.96 --> 6104.88]  you didn't come down
[6104.88 --> 6105.98]  so then I came and got you
[6105.98 --> 6106.72]  like 20 minutes
[6106.72 --> 6107.12]  half an hour
[6107.12 --> 6108.00]  into live stream
[6108.00 --> 6109.94]  so way to go
[6109.94 --> 6111.06]  so fired
[6111.06 --> 6112.10]  I made it
[6112.10 --> 6113.00]  just so fired
[6113.00 --> 6114.28]  I made it
[6114.28 --> 6115.88]  yeah you made it
[6115.88 --> 6117.48]  that's true
[6117.48 --> 6118.72]  everyone says goodnight
[6118.72 --> 6120.20]  we should see how many people tune out
[6120.20 --> 6121.00]  when we say goodnight
[6121.00 --> 6121.66]  versus how many
[6121.66 --> 6122.76]  how many people tune out
[6122.76 --> 6124.30]  when we actually stop broadcasting
[6124.30 --> 6126.04]  we're doing pretty okay
[6126.04 --> 6127.76]  yeah we're doing pretty okay
[6127.76 --> 6129.32]  thank you guys for all tuning in
[6129.32 --> 6129.72]  oh yeah
[6129.72 --> 6130.08]  this is
[6130.08 --> 6131.00]  this was Slick's
[6131.00 --> 6131.90]  benchmarking field
[6131.90 --> 6132.62]  oh my goodness
[6132.62 --> 6134.66]  how much of this did you eat
[6134.66 --> 6135.84]  about half of it
[6135.84 --> 6137.48]  no I went through
[6137.48 --> 6138.48]  is it a half
[6138.48 --> 6140.16]  wow that's like three quarters
[6140.16 --> 6142.34]  so over like two or three days
[6142.34 --> 6144.04]  I would just sit in here
[6144.04 --> 6145.18]  and I had to keep myself going
[6145.18 --> 6147.06]  so I'm running on pretty much no sleep
[6147.06 --> 6148.00]  at all
[6148.00 --> 6149.14]  this whole time
[6149.14 --> 6151.34]  running just an incredible amount of benchmarks
[6151.34 --> 6153.42]  so I had stone wheat thins crackers
[6153.42 --> 6155.34]  and I went through two entire bags
[6155.34 --> 6156.50]  of stone wheat thins crackers
[6156.50 --> 6157.10]  all for this
[6157.10 --> 6159.58]  and three quarters of a tub
[6159.58 --> 6160.92]  of chunky peanut butter
[6160.92 --> 6162.48]  that's disgusting
[6162.48 --> 6164.12]  which obviously has nothing to do
[6164.12 --> 6165.54]  with why I had a headache today
[6165.54 --> 6167.30]  yeah probably nothing to do
[6167.30 --> 6167.34]  no nothing at all
[6167.34 --> 6168.62]  I mean have you even eaten today
[6168.62 --> 6169.16]  no
[6169.16 --> 6170.34]  did you have breakfast
[6170.34 --> 6171.66]  well remember I like
[6171.66 --> 6173.08]  partially threw up
[6173.08 --> 6174.28]  my first breakfast
[6174.28 --> 6175.16]  oh right okay
[6175.16 --> 6176.14]  and then we had lunch
[6176.14 --> 6176.74]  and then
[6176.74 --> 6176.92]  right
[6176.92 --> 6178.18]  oh but you had lunch
[6178.18 --> 6178.92]  I had lunch
[6178.92 --> 6179.68]  that was like
[6179.68 --> 6180.58]  kind of unsettling
[6180.58 --> 6181.50]  remember I almost like
[6181.50 --> 6182.04]  didn't finish
[6182.04 --> 6182.90]  right okay
[6182.90 --> 6183.74]  so
[6183.74 --> 6186.36]  Titan kind of beat me up
[6186.36 --> 6186.94]  a little bit
[6186.94 --> 6187.46]  um
[6187.46 --> 6188.84]  uh dinner's really good though
[6188.84 --> 6190.24]  yeah
[6190.24 --> 6191.26]  it's uh
[6191.26 --> 6191.82]  like peanut
[6191.82 --> 6192.44]  peanut chicken
[6192.44 --> 6193.12]  thing
[6193.12 --> 6193.72]  and rice
[6193.72 --> 6194.56]  oh
[6194.56 --> 6195.58]  yeah it's kind of awesome
[6195.58 --> 6196.74]  I don't know if it's as good
[6196.74 --> 6197.48]  as the pasta
[6197.48 --> 6198.36]  that we had
[6198.36 --> 6199.18]  the last time though
[6199.18 --> 6199.66]  that was
[6199.66 --> 6200.60]  that was awesome
[6200.60 --> 6201.10]  that was awesome
[6201.10 --> 6201.96]  um
[6201.96 --> 6202.68]  oh here's
[6202.68 --> 6203.70]  here's an interesting tidbit
[6203.70 --> 6204.30]  we actually
[6204.30 --> 6204.88]  um
[6204.88 --> 6205.84]  we did a video
[6205.84 --> 6206.56]  where we showed off
[6206.56 --> 6207.62]  our Titan test bench
[6207.62 --> 6208.56]  um
[6208.56 --> 6210.04]  showing the OCZ
[6210.04 --> 6210.80]  oh
[6210.80 --> 6212.12]  this is very interesting
[6212.12 --> 6212.54]  actually
[6212.54 --> 6213.94]  showing the
[6213.94 --> 6214.72]  whoopsie baby
[6214.72 --> 6216.08]  so many cables
[6216.08 --> 6217.70]  showing the OCZ
[6217.70 --> 6219.96]  ZX1250 watt power supply
[6219.96 --> 6221.32]  as our test bench power supply
[6221.32 --> 6222.58]  we have now officially
[6222.58 --> 6223.92]  retired that power supply
[6223.92 --> 6224.72]  from our test bench
[6224.72 --> 6225.20]  because
[6225.20 --> 6226.22]  it will never return
[6226.22 --> 6226.70]  yeah
[6226.70 --> 6227.58]  it will never be back
[6227.58 --> 6228.28]  it still
[6228.28 --> 6228.86]  you know
[6228.86 --> 6229.60]  outputs power
[6229.60 --> 6230.64]  and it's still very efficient
[6230.64 --> 6231.38]  and it's you know
[6231.38 --> 6232.14]  beautifully sleeved
[6232.14 --> 6232.50]  and all that
[6232.50 --> 6233.28]  but
[6233.28 --> 6234.78]  it makes
[6234.78 --> 6236.06]  our GPUs
[6236.06 --> 6236.72]  coil wine
[6236.72 --> 6238.38]  like crazy
[6238.38 --> 6240.50]  and some of our GPUs
[6240.50 --> 6242.30]  make it coil wine
[6242.30 --> 6243.52]  so coil wine
[6243.52 --> 6244.20]  if you guys don't know
[6244.20 --> 6244.82]  I have a video
[6244.82 --> 6246.42]  demonstrating what coil wine is
[6246.42 --> 6246.80]  called
[6246.80 --> 6248.34]  coil wine
[6248.34 --> 6249.36]  or something along those lines
[6249.36 --> 6250.46]  and
[6250.46 --> 6251.60]  so coil wine
[6251.60 --> 6252.56]  is really really annoying
[6252.56 --> 6253.24]  to me anyway
[6253.24 --> 6254.60]  and
[6254.60 --> 6255.92]  it can often be
[6255.92 --> 6256.96]  not only
[6256.96 --> 6258.34]  one component
[6258.34 --> 6259.74]  so two components
[6259.74 --> 6260.38]  might actually
[6260.38 --> 6260.98]  individually
[6260.98 --> 6261.86]  not coil wine
[6261.86 --> 6262.30]  at all
[6262.30 --> 6263.22]  but when you put them
[6263.22 --> 6263.88]  together
[6263.88 --> 6265.10]  they might coil wine
[6265.10 --> 6266.48]  so this particular
[6266.48 --> 6267.12]  power supply
[6267.12 --> 6269.02]  caused our AMD graphics
[6269.02 --> 6269.92]  cards to coil wine
[6269.92 --> 6271.12]  so here I thought
[6271.12 --> 6272.74]  every AMD card
[6272.74 --> 6273.26]  and
[6273.26 --> 6274.60]  and our NVIDIA ones
[6274.60 --> 6275.08]  which one?
[6275.58 --> 6275.74]  Titan
[6275.74 --> 6278.42]  but very quietly
[6278.42 --> 6278.92]  no
[6278.92 --> 6279.24]  Titan made
[6279.24 --> 6280.36]  this coil wine
[6280.36 --> 6281.08]  oh that's what was
[6281.08 --> 6281.36]  coil whining
[6281.36 --> 6282.28]  that's what was whining
[6282.28 --> 6282.90]  on the bench
[6282.90 --> 6284.06]  when we had Titan on it
[6284.06 --> 6285.22]  that's why I figured it out
[6285.22 --> 6286.14]  because I knew Titan
[6286.14 --> 6286.64]  didn't whine
[6286.64 --> 6287.36]  because I had it on the
[6287.36 --> 6288.12]  other bench over there
[6288.12 --> 6289.32]  with that cheapo
[6289.32 --> 6290.22]  inwind power supply
[6290.22 --> 6291.52]  and I was like
[6291.52 --> 6292.58]  well if it doesn't
[6292.58 --> 6293.76]  makes sense that it's
[6293.76 --> 6294.50]  whining over there
[6294.50 --> 6295.66]  but it didn't whine
[6295.66 --> 6296.16]  over there
[6296.16 --> 6297.22]  but then it did
[6297.22 --> 6298.42]  on our 1250 watt
[6298.42 --> 6299.62]  80 plus gold power supply
[6299.62 --> 6300.04]  and I was like
[6300.04 --> 6300.72]  what?
[6300.72 --> 6301.16]  what?
[6301.66 --> 6301.78]  what?
[6301.78 --> 6304.74]  so we went back
[6304.74 --> 6305.62]  and we realized
[6305.62 --> 6307.90]  that we had to redo
[6307.90 --> 6309.42]  all of our acoustics testing
[6309.42 --> 6311.84]  with a high quality
[6311.84 --> 6312.68]  power supply
[6312.68 --> 6313.60]  so that's an
[6313.60 --> 6313.92]  Antec
[6313.92 --> 6315.48]  high current pro
[6315.48 --> 6316.38]  1000 watt
[6316.38 --> 6317.28]  I have to hold it all
[6317.28 --> 6317.80]  weird like that
[6317.80 --> 6318.20]  so you can actually
[6318.20 --> 6318.60]  read it
[6318.60 --> 6318.82]  sorry
[6318.82 --> 6319.74]  high current pro
[6319.74 --> 6320.52]  1000 watt
[6320.52 --> 6321.46]  80 plus platinum
[6321.46 --> 6322.12]  power supply
[6322.12 --> 6322.68]  this is actually
[6322.68 --> 6323.42]  one of the finest
[6323.42 --> 6324.22]  power supplies
[6324.22 --> 6324.96]  ever made
[6324.96 --> 6325.74]  in terms of
[6325.74 --> 6326.26]  the internal
[6326.26 --> 6327.16]  quality
[6327.16 --> 6328.28]  awesome
[6328.28 --> 6329.42]  power supply
[6329.42 --> 6330.28]  the soldering
[6330.28 --> 6331.34]  is a
[6331.34 --> 6332.18]  I would hang it
[6332.18 --> 6332.58]  on my wall
[6332.58 --> 6332.78]  that's not that one
[6332.78 --> 6333.58]  still
[6333.58 --> 6334.56]  but this one's
[6334.56 --> 6335.38]  actually really good too
[6335.38 --> 6336.02]  still if you look
[6336.02 --> 6336.56]  in the inside
[6336.56 --> 6337.28]  it's just like
[6337.28 --> 6337.98]  perfect
[6337.98 --> 6339.02]  absolutely gorgeous
[6339.02 --> 6340.54]  zero coil whine
[6340.54 --> 6342.14]  zero unnecessary noise
[6342.14 --> 6343.72]  and just
[6343.72 --> 6344.76]  awesome power supply
[6344.76 --> 6345.58]  so we've switched over
[6345.58 --> 6346.78]  to that for our test bench
[6346.78 --> 6348.88]  and so all of our
[6348.88 --> 6349.96]  power consumption numbers
[6349.96 --> 6351.18]  were taken on this one
[6351.18 --> 6352.18]  but all of our
[6352.18 --> 6353.08]  acoustics numbers
[6353.08 --> 6354.08]  were actually taken
[6354.08 --> 6355.36]  on that one
[6355.36 --> 6356.86]  and doing very
[6356.86 --> 6357.84]  very similar benchmarks
[6357.84 --> 6358.88]  to the power consumption
[6358.88 --> 6359.40]  that I did on that
[6359.40 --> 6360.34]  just to make sure
[6360.34 --> 6360.74]  that that was
[6360.74 --> 6361.54]  somewhat accurate
[6361.54 --> 6362.54]  I went back
[6362.54 --> 6363.64]  and while I was
[6363.64 --> 6364.40]  running those ones
[6364.40 --> 6365.28]  would glance down
[6365.28 --> 6365.98]  at load and idle
[6365.98 --> 6366.24]  power
[6366.24 --> 6367.04]  was it about right
[6367.04 --> 6367.56]  and they were
[6367.56 --> 6368.16]  fairly accurate
[6368.16 --> 6369.46]  although there was
[6369.46 --> 6370.10]  something wonky
[6370.10 --> 6370.66]  about our power
[6370.66 --> 6371.30]  consumption numbers
[6371.30 --> 6371.84]  so I don't think
[6371.84 --> 6372.60]  I actually ended up
[6372.60 --> 6373.24]  publishing them
[6373.24 --> 6374.42]  I think that was
[6374.42 --> 6376.10]  that was probably
[6376.10 --> 6376.80]  due to our test
[6376.80 --> 6377.30]  that was a few
[6377.30 --> 6377.82]  different things
[6377.82 --> 6378.58]  our test wasn't
[6378.58 --> 6379.18]  that good
[6379.18 --> 6381.24]  and different
[6381.24 --> 6382.10]  optimization problems
[6382.10 --> 6382.48]  and what not
[6382.48 --> 6382.80]  right
[6382.80 --> 6383.06]  yeah
[6383.06 --> 6384.40]  okay
[6384.40 --> 6384.96]  so yeah
[6384.96 --> 6385.74]  that was interesting
[6385.74 --> 6386.22]  oh
[6386.22 --> 6386.92]  oh
[6386.92 --> 6387.40]  oh
[6387.40 --> 6388.14]  I recovered
[6388.14 --> 6388.86]  the
[6389.40 --> 6390.86]  okay this is the
[6390.86 --> 6391.70]  craziest thing
[6391.70 --> 6392.28]  that the crazy
[6392.28 --> 6393.00]  Russian has ever
[6393.00 --> 6393.28]  done
[6393.28 --> 6395.04]  so I gave him
[6395.04 --> 6396.22]  a 580 to use
[6396.22 --> 6397.80]  and he actually
[6397.80 --> 6398.98]  or rather a 590
[6398.98 --> 6399.42]  to use
[6399.42 --> 6400.60]  my famous
[6400.60 --> 6401.66]  Apple edition
[6401.66 --> 6402.92]  GTX 590
[6402.92 --> 6405.96]  and he actually
[6405.96 --> 6406.72]  asked me
[6406.72 --> 6407.52]  if he could
[6407.52 --> 6408.18]  trade this
[6408.18 --> 6408.90]  back to me
[6408.90 --> 6409.90]  for a 580
[6409.90 --> 6414.78]  590 so boss
[6414.78 --> 6415.44]  I know
[6415.44 --> 6416.64]  590 is boss
[6416.64 --> 6418.44]  590 is most
[6418.44 --> 6419.58]  assuredly faster
[6419.58 --> 6420.32]  than a 580
[6420.32 --> 6421.78]  so he has a
[6421.78 --> 6422.28]  collection
[6422.28 --> 6423.84]  and actually
[6423.84 --> 6424.16]  okay
[6424.16 --> 6424.54]  it's a
[6424.54 --> 6425.40]  in his defense
[6425.40 --> 6425.86]  it's a pretty
[6425.86 --> 6426.82]  impressive collection
[6426.82 --> 6428.38]  of the flagship
[6428.38 --> 6429.32]  card
[6429.32 --> 6430.34]  of every
[6430.34 --> 6430.72]  major
[6430.72 --> 6431.20]  GPU
[6431.20 --> 6431.82]  architecture
[6431.82 --> 6433.36]  so he
[6433.36 --> 6434.60]  needs a 580
[6434.60 --> 6435.44]  for his
[6435.44 --> 6436.34]  flagship
[6436.34 --> 6437.08]  Kepler
[6437.08 --> 6437.58]  GPU
[6437.58 --> 6438.60]  collection
[6438.60 --> 6439.94]  so to add
[6439.94 --> 6440.44]  to his collection
[6440.44 --> 6441.32]  whereas a 590
[6441.32 --> 6442.54]  he doesn't collect
[6442.54 --> 6443.20]  dual GPU
[6443.20 --> 6443.66]  cards
[6443.66 --> 6445.00]  I mean I can see
[6445.00 --> 6445.34]  why
[6445.34 --> 6445.90]  because they're
[6445.90 --> 6446.78]  baller expensive
[6446.78 --> 6448.10]  but so he has
[6448.10 --> 6449.36]  I think he has
[6449.36 --> 6450.18]  either a 9700
[6450.18 --> 6450.90]  pro or a
[6450.90 --> 6451.34]  9800
[6451.34 --> 6451.98]  pro
[6451.98 --> 6453.18]  he has
[6453.18 --> 6456.96]  whatever
[6456.96 --> 6457.60]  he has like
[6457.60 --> 6458.74]  one super
[6458.74 --> 6459.32]  high end
[6459.32 --> 6460.10]  of each
[6460.10 --> 6460.86]  generation of
[6460.86 --> 6461.30]  cards
[6461.30 --> 6461.92]  running down
[6461.92 --> 6462.26]  each
[6462.26 --> 6463.32]  brand
[6463.32 --> 6463.82]  yeah each
[6463.82 --> 6464.14]  side
[6464.14 --> 6465.96]  so he
[6465.96 --> 6466.70]  would rather
[6466.70 --> 6467.56]  have the 580
[6467.56 --> 6468.54]  for the fact
[6468.54 --> 6469.02]  that he can
[6469.02 --> 6469.54]  game on it
[6469.54 --> 6470.32]  now and have
[6470.32 --> 6470.72]  it for his
[6470.72 --> 6471.14]  collection
[6471.14 --> 6472.18]  versus
[6472.18 --> 6473.66]  having a 590
[6473.66 --> 6474.34]  to game on
[6474.34 --> 6475.26]  and have it
[6475.26 --> 6475.96]  not be applicable
[6475.96 --> 6476.24]  to his
[6476.24 --> 6476.52]  collection
[6476.52 --> 6476.92]  so I thought
[6476.92 --> 6477.32]  that was the
[6477.32 --> 6477.92]  craziest thing
[6477.92 --> 6478.66]  I ever heard
[6478.66 --> 6482.18]  so yeah
[6482.18 --> 6482.94]  so anyway
[6482.94 --> 6483.86]  that means
[6483.86 --> 6484.34]  that I could
[6484.34 --> 6485.40]  potentially go
[6485.40 --> 6487.20]  quad SLI
[6487.20 --> 6488.98]  for my personal
[6488.98 --> 6489.76]  rig if I ever
[6489.76 --> 6490.40]  actually finish
[6490.40 --> 6490.94]  building it
[6490.94 --> 6492.02]  or because the
[6492.02 --> 6492.44]  heat output
[6492.44 --> 6492.78]  from that
[6492.78 --> 6493.08]  would be
[6493.08 --> 6493.74]  ridiculous
[6493.74 --> 6494.44]  and summer's
[6494.44 --> 6494.64]  coming
[6494.64 --> 6495.06]  I could
[6495.06 --> 6496.54]  just put this
[6496.54 --> 6496.96]  back into
[6496.96 --> 6497.68]  the benchmarking
[6497.68 --> 6497.92]  pool
[6497.92 --> 6499.18]  so there you
[6499.18 --> 6499.44]  go
[6499.44 --> 6500.58]  the 590
[6500.58 --> 6501.20]  apple edition
[6501.20 --> 6501.62]  has been
[6501.62 --> 6502.02]  recovered
[6502.02 --> 6502.78]  which is not
[6502.78 --> 6503.28]  really related
[6503.28 --> 6503.80]  to anything
[6503.80 --> 6504.36]  but this is
[6504.36 --> 6504.74]  the after
[6504.74 --> 6505.36]  party anyway
[6505.36 --> 6505.86]  so
[6505.86 --> 6507.84]  whatever
[6507.84 --> 6508.38]  happens on
[6508.38 --> 6508.68]  the after
[6508.68 --> 6508.92]  party
[6508.92 --> 6509.40]  happens on
[6509.40 --> 6509.72]  the after
[6509.72 --> 6509.94]  party
[6509.94 --> 6510.18]  yeah
[6510.18 --> 6511.04]  oh yeah
[6511.04 --> 6511.62]  here's all
[6511.62 --> 6512.06]  your dishes
[6512.06 --> 6512.52]  that you
[6512.52 --> 6513.20]  managed to
[6513.20 --> 6513.74]  not put
[6513.74 --> 6514.04]  away
[6514.04 --> 6514.70]  I basically
[6514.70 --> 6515.46]  lived in
[6515.46 --> 6515.86]  here for
[6515.86 --> 6516.26]  a week
[6516.26 --> 6516.98]  it's cold
[6516.98 --> 6517.36]  in here
[6517.36 --> 6517.80]  and it's
[6517.80 --> 6518.44]  cold in here
[6518.44 --> 6518.80]  yeah what's
[6518.80 --> 6519.20]  the temperature
[6519.20 --> 6519.62]  in here right
[6519.62 --> 6519.90]  now it's
[6519.90 --> 6520.56]  freaking cold
[6520.56 --> 6520.92]  right now
[6520.92 --> 6521.20]  it's been
[6521.20 --> 6521.68]  cold today
[6521.68 --> 6522.94]  so it's
[6522.94 --> 6524.12]  11.8 degrees
[6524.12 --> 6524.76]  in here right now
[6524.76 --> 6525.62]  warmer than I thought
[6525.62 --> 6525.86]  it was
[6525.86 --> 6526.46]  yeah it feels
[6526.46 --> 6527.08]  colder than that
[6527.08 --> 6527.54]  maybe it's just
[6527.54 --> 6527.94]  because it was
[6527.94 --> 6528.66]  so wet today
[6528.66 --> 6529.26]  it's so humid
[6529.26 --> 6530.42]  yeah positioning
[6530.42 --> 6530.94]  that actually
[6530.94 --> 6531.24]  isn't going to
[6531.24 --> 6531.76]  make a difference
[6531.76 --> 6532.32]  you should know
[6532.32 --> 6532.90]  the physics of
[6532.90 --> 6533.24]  that well
[6533.24 --> 6533.44]  enough
[6533.44 --> 6533.74]  it just
[6533.74 --> 6533.96]  changed
[6533.96 --> 6535.00]  0.3 degrees
[6535.00 --> 6536.66]  yeah probably
[6536.66 --> 6537.30]  because you
[6537.30 --> 6538.20]  like breathed
[6538.20 --> 6538.48]  on it
[6538.48 --> 6539.08]  it got colder
[6539.08 --> 6540.22]  you got colder
[6540.22 --> 6541.32]  what's up bro
[6541.32 --> 6543.78]  it doesn't work
[6543.78 --> 6544.22]  that way
[6544.22 --> 6545.70]  there's different
[6545.70 --> 6546.38]  temperature zones
[6546.38 --> 6546.98]  within the room
[6546.98 --> 6548.56]  well a little bit
[6548.56 --> 6549.08]  yeah it just
[6549.08 --> 6549.72]  changed
[6549.72 --> 6550.38]  well yeah but
[6550.38 --> 6550.96]  that doesn't
[6550.96 --> 6551.86]  change the fact
[6551.86 --> 6552.68]  that like
[6552.68 --> 6554.30]  okay I guarantee
[6554.30 --> 6554.84]  you wouldn't be
[6554.84 --> 6555.14]  able to feel
[6555.14 --> 6555.52]  the difference
[6555.52 --> 6556.32]  between 0.2 degrees
[6556.32 --> 6557.04]  this is a boring
[6557.04 --> 6558.40]  discussion topic
[6558.40 --> 6558.92]  it's the after
[6558.92 --> 6559.82]  party who cares
[6559.82 --> 6564.08]  okay
[6564.08 --> 6564.74]  are you going
[6564.74 --> 6565.02]  to eat my
[6565.02 --> 6565.38]  peanut butter
[6565.38 --> 6565.98]  no
[6565.98 --> 6571.18]  actually no
[6571.18 --> 6571.98]  we're not going
[6571.98 --> 6572.24]  to have a
[6572.24 --> 6572.60]  peanut butter
[6572.60 --> 6573.28]  fight right now
[6573.28 --> 6577.48]  although that
[6577.48 --> 6577.96]  would be kind
[6577.96 --> 6578.42]  of awesome
[6578.42 --> 6582.04]  and it's
[6582.04 --> 6582.84]  super cold
[6582.84 --> 6583.56]  did I tell you
[6583.56 --> 6583.94]  about trying
[6583.94 --> 6584.32]  to eat
[6584.32 --> 6585.32]  crackers out
[6585.32 --> 6585.58]  of that
[6585.58 --> 6586.04]  no
[6586.04 --> 6587.18]  I had to
[6587.18 --> 6587.88]  stick my
[6587.88 --> 6588.32]  fingers all
[6588.32 --> 6588.46]  the way
[6588.46 --> 6588.70]  down the
[6588.70 --> 6588.96]  crackers
[6588.96 --> 6589.54]  to reinforce
[6589.54 --> 6590.18]  the backs
[6590.18 --> 6590.76]  because it's
[6590.76 --> 6591.50]  frozen
[6591.50 --> 6592.36]  because it's
[6592.36 --> 6592.76]  in here
[6592.76 --> 6594.06]  so at like
[6594.06 --> 6594.58]  4 in the
[6594.58 --> 6594.86]  morning
[6594.86 --> 6595.24]  when I'm
[6595.24 --> 6595.46]  like
[6595.46 --> 6596.22]  oh I want
[6596.22 --> 6596.60]  more peanut
[6596.60 --> 6596.78]  butter
[6596.78 --> 6597.20]  crackers
[6597.20 --> 6597.92]  I have
[6597.92 --> 6598.38]  to like
[6598.38 --> 6599.84]  and you
[6599.84 --> 6600.20]  were so
[6600.20 --> 6600.78]  zoned out
[6600.78 --> 6601.24]  there was
[6601.24 --> 6601.76]  a package
[6601.76 --> 6602.44]  with one
[6602.44 --> 6602.86]  cracker
[6602.86 --> 6603.42]  left in it
[6603.42 --> 6603.74]  that was
[6603.74 --> 6604.12]  sitting there
[6604.12 --> 6604.42]  for like
[6604.42 --> 6604.84]  an entire
[6604.84 --> 6605.18]  day
[6605.18 --> 6605.80]  and I
[6605.80 --> 6606.16]  think you
[6606.16 --> 6606.62]  had actually
[6606.62 --> 6607.24]  started an
[6607.24 --> 6607.80]  entirely new
[6607.80 --> 6608.12]  pack of
[6608.12 --> 6608.48]  crackers
[6608.48 --> 6609.48]  just like
[6609.48 --> 6609.86]  leaving that
[6609.86 --> 6610.08]  one there
[6610.08 --> 6610.44]  I was like
[6610.44 --> 6610.88]  should I
[6610.88 --> 6611.44]  eat it
[6611.44 --> 6612.48]  benchmarking
[6612.48 --> 6613.44]  oh
[6613.44 --> 6614.60]  benchmarking
[6614.60 --> 6616.96]  must get
[6616.96 --> 6617.32]  all the
[6617.32 --> 6617.80]  numbers
[6617.80 --> 6618.30]  I know
[6618.30 --> 6619.00]  the benchmarking's
[6619.00 --> 6619.74]  not even done
[6619.74 --> 6620.22]  yet either
[6620.22 --> 6620.70]  I know
[6620.70 --> 6621.72]  we still have to
[6621.72 --> 6622.98]  do FX8350
[6622.98 --> 6623.38]  and then we're
[6623.38 --> 6623.82]  ready for the
[6623.82 --> 6624.38]  multi-platform
[6624.38 --> 6624.78]  one right
[6624.78 --> 6625.22]  yep
[6625.22 --> 6626.52]  and then is that
[6626.52 --> 6627.08]  kind of it for
[6627.08 --> 6627.68]  benchmarking
[6627.68 --> 6629.30]  maybe redoing power
[6629.30 --> 6630.20]  if people care
[6630.20 --> 6630.88]  yeah we could redo
[6630.88 --> 6631.48]  power I don't think
[6631.48 --> 6632.16]  anyone really cares
[6632.16 --> 6632.54]  that much
[6632.54 --> 6633.22]  if you're buying a
[6633.22 --> 6633.76]  Titan I don't
[6633.76 --> 6634.46]  yeah it's like
[6634.46 --> 6635.20]  you bought a Titan
[6635.20 --> 6636.12]  and you want to know
[6636.12 --> 6637.02]  like how much power
[6637.02 --> 6637.50]  it consumes
[6637.50 --> 6638.42]  you're probably
[6638.42 --> 6638.74]  you're probably not
[6638.74 --> 6639.20]  running your
[6639.20 --> 6639.62]  EPU
[6639.62 --> 6640.50]  pretty sure you
[6640.50 --> 6641.06]  can deal with it
[6641.06 --> 6641.32]  yeah
[6641.32 --> 6642.60]  and then
[6642.60 --> 6643.06]  um
[6643.06 --> 6645.76]  um
[6645.76 --> 6648.48]  yeah
[6648.48 --> 6650.60]  he's finally
[6650.60 --> 6651.32]  going to Android
[6651.32 --> 6654.02]  I'm trying Android
[6654.02 --> 6654.78]  Diesel and I
[6654.78 --> 6656.18]  kind of
[6656.18 --> 6656.98]  have a victory
[6656.98 --> 6657.36]  there
[6657.36 --> 6658.72]  how is it a victory
[6658.72 --> 6661.08]  I've tried Android
[6661.08 --> 6661.18]  before
[6661.18 --> 6662.08]  you made this big
[6662.08 --> 6663.28]  puff when you first
[6663.28 --> 6664.10]  moved to Windows 8
[6664.10 --> 6664.34]  phone
[6664.34 --> 6665.18]  oh I'm never
[6665.18 --> 6666.16]  trying Android
[6666.16 --> 6667.16]  blah blah blah blah
[6667.16 --> 6668.54]  I've tried Android
[6668.54 --> 6669.18]  well you're trying
[6669.18 --> 6669.90]  Android now
[6669.90 --> 6670.72]  you said you weren't
[6670.72 --> 6671.48]  going to again
[6671.48 --> 6672.46]  and you are now
[6672.46 --> 6675.66]  I might have said that
[6675.66 --> 6676.64]  yeah you did
[6676.64 --> 6677.84]  I might have said that
[6677.84 --> 6678.88]  however however
[6678.88 --> 6679.66]  the right device
[6679.66 --> 6680.18]  wasn't there
[6680.18 --> 6681.10]  I wouldn't try Android
[6681.10 --> 6681.72]  on an S3
[6681.72 --> 6683.06]  right
[6683.06 --> 6684.66]  I just wouldn't
[6684.66 --> 6685.30]  build qualities
[6685.30 --> 6686.04]  shite
[6686.04 --> 6687.14]  I love my S3
[6687.14 --> 6688.16]  but the build qualities
[6688.16 --> 6689.38]  like come on
[6689.38 --> 6689.94]  you can't call it
[6689.94 --> 6690.46]  shite
[6690.46 --> 6691.00]  I mean
[6691.00 --> 6693.02]  it's not that good
[6693.02 --> 6694.50]  it has an AMOLED screen
[6694.50 --> 6696.20]  okay
[6696.20 --> 6697.54]  which is
[6697.54 --> 6698.42]  I'm talking about
[6698.42 --> 6700.10]  spec than build quality
[6700.10 --> 6700.36]  I mean
[6700.36 --> 6701.46]  okay
[6701.46 --> 6702.16]  I'm talking about
[6702.16 --> 6703.20]  pure build quality
[6703.20 --> 6703.62]  from Samsung
[6703.62 --> 6704.40]  here's the trade off
[6704.40 --> 6705.16]  okay so let's talk
[6705.16 --> 6706.08]  let's talk build quality
[6706.08 --> 6706.42]  for a minute
[6706.42 --> 6706.86]  because
[6706.86 --> 6709.10]  Samsung made a decision
[6709.10 --> 6710.24]  designing the S3
[6710.24 --> 6711.46]  to have a user
[6711.46 --> 6712.42]  replaceable battery
[6712.42 --> 6713.30]  yeah
[6713.30 --> 6714.60]  that will affect
[6714.60 --> 6716.20]  the build quality
[6716.20 --> 6716.68]  yes
[6716.68 --> 6717.24]  but then
[6717.24 --> 6718.30]  my Nexus S
[6718.30 --> 6718.76]  had a user
[6718.76 --> 6719.50]  replaceable battery
[6719.50 --> 6720.60]  and had a boss
[6720.60 --> 6721.16]  backplate
[6721.16 --> 6721.66]  but it probably
[6721.66 --> 6722.32]  wasn't as thin
[6722.32 --> 6724.88]  I think
[6724.88 --> 6726.10]  actually
[6726.10 --> 6727.34]  maybe similar
[6727.34 --> 6729.18]  either way
[6729.18 --> 6731.22]  it does cost
[6731.22 --> 6731.86]  it was definitely
[6731.86 --> 6732.28]  thicker
[6732.28 --> 6732.88]  but it wasn't
[6732.88 --> 6733.50]  thicker to the point
[6733.50 --> 6734.46]  where it's noticeable
[6734.46 --> 6735.40]  or a problem
[6735.40 --> 6735.82]  yeah but thicker
[6735.82 --> 6736.24]  to the point
[6736.24 --> 6736.88]  where it's noticeable
[6736.88 --> 6737.54]  is not a good
[6737.54 --> 6738.40]  marketing bullet point
[6738.40 --> 6740.28]  you want to be able
[6740.28 --> 6740.66]  to say
[6740.66 --> 6741.98]  this thin
[6741.98 --> 6742.94]  yeah but I
[6742.94 --> 6744.16]  honestly would rather
[6744.16 --> 6744.86]  have a little bit
[6744.86 --> 6745.28]  more bulk
[6745.28 --> 6745.86]  in my phones
[6745.86 --> 6746.74]  that's one of the
[6746.74 --> 6747.22]  reasons why
[6747.22 --> 6747.68]  I never
[6747.68 --> 6749.22]  I do not like
[6749.22 --> 6749.90]  iOS
[6749.90 --> 6750.82]  I don't like
[6750.82 --> 6752.80]  Apple operating systems
[6752.80 --> 6754.10]  but the feel
[6754.10 --> 6755.20]  of iPhones is nice
[6755.20 --> 6755.98]  because they weigh
[6755.98 --> 6756.60]  a little bit
[6756.60 --> 6757.56]  I want to feel like
[6757.56 --> 6758.64]  I'm holding something
[6758.64 --> 6759.72]  like people are showing
[6759.72 --> 6760.84]  the see-through phones
[6760.84 --> 6761.66]  yeah
[6761.66 --> 6762.14]  oh yeah
[6762.14 --> 6763.62]  that looks cool
[6763.62 --> 6764.70]  and like that's cool
[6764.70 --> 6766.10]  but it's gonna suck
[6766.10 --> 6767.04]  when I pull it out of my pocket
[6767.04 --> 6767.42]  I'm like
[6767.42 --> 6767.96]  eh
[6767.96 --> 6769.30]  I need to like
[6769.30 --> 6770.46]  somehow deal with
[6770.46 --> 6771.76]  this tiny fragile thing
[6771.76 --> 6772.58]  which I'm probably
[6772.58 --> 6773.44]  gonna want to put a case
[6773.44 --> 6773.78]  on anyway
[6773.78 --> 6774.46]  so I don't scratch
[6774.46 --> 6774.92]  the screen
[6774.92 --> 6775.84]  yeah that'd be hilarious
[6775.84 --> 6776.64]  a see-through phone
[6776.64 --> 6777.54]  with like an otterbox
[6777.54 --> 6777.88]  on it
[6777.88 --> 6781.78]  with like the otterbox
[6781.78 --> 6782.32]  armors
[6782.32 --> 6784.16]  just like super beast
[6784.16 --> 6784.74]  or a pelican
[6784.74 --> 6785.74]  you know what else
[6785.74 --> 6786.30]  has been kind of
[6786.30 --> 6787.06]  happening right now
[6787.06 --> 6788.08]  is Google Glasses
[6788.08 --> 6788.54]  are getting
[6788.54 --> 6789.52]  or Google Glass rather
[6789.52 --> 6791.28]  is getting previewed
[6791.28 --> 6792.84]  so the Verges editor
[6792.84 --> 6793.58]  has like
[6793.58 --> 6794.60]  a billion tweets
[6794.60 --> 6795.26]  about it
[6795.26 --> 6796.60]  and is sort of
[6796.60 --> 6797.08]  talking about
[6797.08 --> 6798.12]  the user experience
[6798.12 --> 6798.78]  you know
[6798.78 --> 6799.64]  no it's not suitable
[6799.64 --> 6800.30]  for just like
[6800.30 --> 6801.12]  sitting and reading
[6801.12 --> 6801.58]  an article
[6801.58 --> 6802.50]  or reading a book
[6802.50 --> 6803.90]  but yes it's cool
[6803.90 --> 6804.50]  in these ways
[6804.50 --> 6804.94]  and these ways
[6804.94 --> 6805.34]  and these ways
[6805.34 --> 6805.88]  I mean that
[6805.88 --> 6806.86]  is so exciting
[6806.86 --> 6808.28]  I mean Google Glass V1
[6808.28 --> 6810.00]  it'll be a cold day
[6810.00 --> 6811.18]  in hell before I pay for that
[6811.18 --> 6811.86]  I can tell you that
[6811.86 --> 6812.42]  right now
[6812.42 --> 6813.30]  but once it's like
[6813.30 --> 6814.18]  version 6
[6814.18 --> 6815.58]  and actually looks like glasses
[6815.58 --> 6817.34]  and doesn't have this
[6817.34 --> 6818.14]  like crazy arm
[6818.14 --> 6818.90]  that goes around
[6818.90 --> 6819.84]  like once it's actually
[6819.84 --> 6820.78]  just a pair of glasses
[6820.78 --> 6821.54]  that'll be fantastic
[6821.54 --> 6822.34]  like it's like
[6822.34 --> 6823.26]  it's like Bluetooth
[6823.26 --> 6824.46]  earpieces
[6824.46 --> 6825.64]  where like
[6825.64 --> 6826.98]  the first generation ones
[6826.98 --> 6828.04]  when people weren't
[6828.04 --> 6828.50]  used to it
[6828.50 --> 6829.04]  for one thing
[6829.04 --> 6829.88]  so there was a stigma
[6829.88 --> 6830.46]  around it
[6830.46 --> 6831.32]  because you'd be like
[6831.32 --> 6832.20]  and no one was used
[6832.20 --> 6832.92]  to people just walking
[6832.92 --> 6833.80]  around talking on their
[6833.80 --> 6834.58]  phone without an actual
[6834.58 --> 6835.38]  phone next to them
[6835.38 --> 6836.32]  so there was like
[6836.32 --> 6837.10]  the social stigma
[6837.10 --> 6838.02]  that went along with it
[6838.02 --> 6839.78]  Google Glass is gonna be
[6839.78 --> 6840.28]  like that
[6840.28 --> 6841.76]  for a long time
[6841.76 --> 6842.46]  it's gonna be like
[6842.46 --> 6844.10]  a super dork thing
[6844.10 --> 6844.74]  I think
[6844.74 --> 6847.52]  until it's fashionable
[6847.52 --> 6849.02]  until it's a fashion accessory
[6849.02 --> 6850.30]  but geek and nerd
[6850.30 --> 6853.92]  kind of socializing thing
[6853.92 --> 6855.02]  whatever you want to call it
[6855.02 --> 6855.70]  like the
[6855.70 --> 6857.04]  so geek culture
[6857.04 --> 6858.24]  is more socially acceptable
[6858.24 --> 6860.40]  by a long shot
[6860.40 --> 6861.34]  than it was when
[6861.34 --> 6862.48]  Bluetooth headsets came out
[6862.48 --> 6862.90]  that's true
[6862.90 --> 6863.62]  that's true
[6863.62 --> 6864.68]  because it's like
[6864.68 --> 6865.96]  it's actually kind of fashionable
[6865.96 --> 6866.70]  and trendy
[6866.70 --> 6868.18]  to be the nerdy
[6868.18 --> 6869.20]  geeky thing
[6869.20 --> 6871.42]  I would go as far as to say
[6871.42 --> 6872.56]  that Android is still not
[6872.56 --> 6873.58]  fashionable or trendy
[6873.58 --> 6874.94]  I think that changed
[6874.94 --> 6875.60]  S3
[6875.60 --> 6878.00]  I don't know that S3
[6878.00 --> 6879.14]  is fashionable or trendy
[6879.14 --> 6880.94]  I think it's just
[6880.94 --> 6882.54]  like the best choice
[6882.54 --> 6883.06]  and he does not
[6883.06 --> 6884.04]  hit my head on that again
[6884.04 --> 6885.20]  even in like
[6885.20 --> 6886.44]  commercials and stuff now
[6886.44 --> 6887.08]  people are holding
[6887.08 --> 6888.22]  you know how it was always
[6888.22 --> 6889.18]  Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple
[6889.18 --> 6890.68]  people are holding S3s now
[6890.68 --> 6890.78]  okay
[6890.78 --> 6891.86]  Samsung spent like
[6891.86 --> 6892.80]  a billion dollars
[6892.80 --> 6894.02]  on marketing last year
[6894.02 --> 6894.58]  that's true
[6894.58 --> 6895.28]  maybe that has something
[6895.28 --> 6895.96]  to do with it being
[6895.96 --> 6896.86]  fashionable and trendy
[6896.86 --> 6897.68]  at least a little bit
[6897.68 --> 6898.46]  but it is
[6898.46 --> 6899.24]  but I don't think
[6899.24 --> 6900.34]  it's inherently fashionable
[6900.34 --> 6900.86]  or trendy
[6900.86 --> 6902.38]  it's not to the level
[6902.38 --> 6903.74]  it's not a beautiful device
[6903.74 --> 6904.66]  like an iPhone is
[6904.66 --> 6906.16]  no and it's not to the level
[6906.16 --> 6906.66]  of
[6906.66 --> 6907.96]  and like
[6907.96 --> 6908.20]  okay
[6908.20 --> 6908.96]  some of the backs
[6908.96 --> 6909.64]  that you can put on them
[6909.64 --> 6910.20]  are pretty sweet
[6910.20 --> 6911.38]  it's true
[6911.38 --> 6912.10]  but you have to buy it
[6912.10 --> 6912.58]  aftermarket
[6912.58 --> 6913.42]  and then blah blah blah
[6913.42 --> 6914.48]  and I haven't even done
[6914.48 --> 6915.82]  and that's a dorky thing to do
[6915.82 --> 6916.90]  buy it aftermarket
[6916.90 --> 6917.30]  yeah
[6917.30 --> 6918.12]  does that mean
[6918.12 --> 6919.46]  buying cases is dorky
[6919.46 --> 6920.12]  not necessarily
[6920.12 --> 6920.74]  but it's like
[6920.74 --> 6921.80]  buying a fashion case
[6921.80 --> 6922.90]  is not necessarily dorky
[6922.90 --> 6923.60]  buying like
[6923.60 --> 6925.06]  buying a backed plate
[6925.06 --> 6926.56]  so buying a replaceable part
[6926.56 --> 6927.40]  you're saying is dorky
[6927.40 --> 6928.80]  I would say it's more dorky
[6928.80 --> 6929.64]  I don't know
[6929.64 --> 6930.02]  maybe
[6930.02 --> 6931.20]  because okay
[6931.20 --> 6931.92]  I just have no idea
[6931.92 --> 6932.70]  like at a stand
[6932.70 --> 6933.88]  on the Las Vegas Strip
[6933.88 --> 6934.88]  you can get cases
[6934.88 --> 6935.04]  there's like
[6935.04 --> 6936.60]  bejeweled or Hello Kitty cases
[6936.60 --> 6936.88]  yeah
[6936.88 --> 6937.86]  do they have
[6937.86 --> 6938.48]  like
[6938.48 --> 6939.62]  customized back plates
[6939.62 --> 6939.84]  no
[6939.84 --> 6941.04]  that used to be
[6941.04 --> 6941.74]  more of a thing
[6941.74 --> 6942.62]  like I remember
[6942.62 --> 6943.16]  there was a
[6943.16 --> 6944.04]  Sony Ericsson phone
[6944.04 --> 6944.50]  that I used
[6944.50 --> 6945.18]  for a little while
[6945.18 --> 6946.50]  that had like
[6946.50 --> 6947.80]  a billion options
[6947.80 --> 6948.54]  for these like
[6948.54 --> 6949.16]  replaceable plates
[6949.16 --> 6949.70]  and that whole thing
[6949.70 --> 6950.42]  just kind of died
[6950.42 --> 6950.98]  yeah
[6950.98 --> 6952.36]  and then now it seems
[6952.36 --> 6953.26]  to be sort of
[6953.26 --> 6953.76]  back
[6953.76 --> 6954.14]  but
[6954.14 --> 6955.80]  like whether it's cool
[6955.80 --> 6956.68]  again or not
[6956.68 --> 6957.26]  I don't
[6957.26 --> 6957.92]  I don't actually know
[6957.92 --> 6958.60]  I'm not that cool
[6958.60 --> 6959.64]  so it's hard for me to say
[6959.64 --> 6960.80]  yeah
[6960.80 --> 6961.50]  we're both
[6961.50 --> 6962.64]  we're both talking about like
[6962.64 --> 6963.44]  yeah like what's cool
[6963.44 --> 6964.14]  fashion and culture
[6964.14 --> 6964.76]  and we're both like
[6964.76 --> 6965.34]  uh
[6965.34 --> 6966.14]  there's you and like
[6966.14 --> 6967.14]  your team liquid
[6967.14 --> 6967.68]  uh
[6967.68 --> 6968.28]  hoodie
[6968.28 --> 6969.38]  and Assassin's Creed shirt
[6969.38 --> 6970.54]  and like me with like
[6970.54 --> 6971.30]  I have like
[6971.30 --> 6972.36]  uh bleach stains
[6972.36 --> 6973.38]  on my
[6973.38 --> 6974.24]  see here
[6974.24 --> 6974.60]  I got like
[6974.60 --> 6975.20]  and thermal paste
[6975.20 --> 6976.00]  bleach stains
[6976.00 --> 6977.22]  and like this is food
[6977.22 --> 6977.76]  or something
[6977.76 --> 6978.94]  like this stain here
[6978.94 --> 6980.14]  and I have thermal paste
[6980.14 --> 6980.84]  on the insides
[6980.84 --> 6981.40]  of the pockets
[6981.40 --> 6982.24]  from like wiping
[6982.24 --> 6982.80]  thermal paste
[6982.80 --> 6983.46]  off my hands
[6983.46 --> 6983.80]  and like
[6983.80 --> 6985.00]  that's what I'm wearing
[6985.00 --> 6986.28]  like this is what I look like
[6986.28 --> 6987.50]  in my jeans from Costco
[6987.50 --> 6989.10]  these are jeans that I bought
[6989.10 --> 6989.82]  in like grade 9
[6989.82 --> 6990.46]  yeah
[6990.46 --> 6991.28]  well
[6991.28 --> 6992.26]  mine are from Costco
[6992.26 --> 6992.96]  and I own like
[6992.96 --> 6993.86]  six or seven pairs
[6993.86 --> 6994.70]  of the same jeans
[6994.70 --> 6995.56]  that's fantastic
[6995.56 --> 6996.88]  I actually don't own
[6996.88 --> 6997.40]  other jeans
[6997.40 --> 7000.68]  and you know what the funny
[7000.68 --> 7001.26]  thing is too
[7001.26 --> 7003.60]  the funny thing about pants
[7003.60 --> 7004.58]  is that
[7004.58 --> 7005.60]  you know how many times
[7005.60 --> 7006.32]  I've been called out
[7006.32 --> 7007.42]  for wearing the same shirt
[7007.42 --> 7008.24]  over and over again
[7008.24 --> 7008.68]  on an unboxing
[7008.68 --> 7009.50]  but no one will call you
[7009.50 --> 7010.14]  out for pants
[7010.14 --> 7010.40]  okay
[7010.40 --> 7011.76]  so the shirt
[7011.76 --> 7012.90]  usually is because
[7012.90 --> 7014.32]  I do a batch of unboxings
[7014.32 --> 7014.80]  at a time
[7014.80 --> 7015.86]  not because I wear the same
[7015.86 --> 7016.48]  shirt every day
[7016.48 --> 7017.70]  but if you look back
[7017.70 --> 7018.92]  at probably
[7018.92 --> 7020.42]  out of the
[7020.42 --> 7022.30]  1700 or so videos
[7022.30 --> 7023.14]  I've uploaded
[7023.14 --> 7024.28]  in the last five years
[7024.28 --> 7026.18]  maybe the last three years
[7026.18 --> 7027.60]  I'm wearing the exact
[7027.60 --> 7028.44]  same pants
[7028.44 --> 7030.26]  in every single one
[7030.26 --> 7031.42]  and here comes an influx
[7031.42 --> 7032.28]  of change your pants
[7032.28 --> 7033.12]  yeah
[7033.12 --> 7034.54]  but I will not change
[7034.54 --> 7035.10]  my pants
[7035.10 --> 7036.30]  and yeah
[7036.30 --> 7036.88]  so I just
[7036.88 --> 7038.48]  I have a pair of pants
[7038.48 --> 7039.38]  for every day of the week
[7039.38 --> 7040.40]  and they're all the same
[7040.40 --> 7041.34]  actually one of them
[7041.34 --> 7041.96]  is slightly darker
[7041.96 --> 7042.50]  than the others
[7042.50 --> 7043.42]  and then one of them
[7043.42 --> 7044.06]  is hemmed
[7044.06 --> 7044.52]  and the others
[7044.52 --> 7045.14]  are all shredded
[7045.14 --> 7045.80]  at the bottom
[7045.80 --> 7050.40]  so a fashion icon
[7050.40 --> 7051.16]  I am not
[7051.16 --> 7051.88]  my favorite
[7051.88 --> 7053.30]  like story
[7053.30 --> 7054.12]  about how we're not
[7054.12 --> 7054.86]  fashion icons
[7054.86 --> 7055.20]  was
[7055.20 --> 7056.84]  Diesel joining the crew
[7056.84 --> 7057.70]  and then
[7057.70 --> 7058.76]  us being down in Vegas
[7058.76 --> 7060.46]  and him being so upset
[7060.46 --> 7061.46]  and distraught
[7061.46 --> 7062.36]  with the fact
[7062.36 --> 7063.36]  that I looked so
[7063.36 --> 7064.84]  horribly homeless
[7064.84 --> 7065.96]  yeah but I was a little
[7065.96 --> 7066.94]  upset and distraught
[7066.94 --> 7067.64]  with how homeless
[7067.64 --> 7068.36]  you looked too
[7068.36 --> 7069.58]  it was kind of embarrassing
[7069.58 --> 7071.24]  so Diesel bought me jeans
[7071.24 --> 7071.26]  we're like
[7071.26 --> 7072.20]  we're going to meetings
[7072.20 --> 7072.54]  right
[7072.54 --> 7073.88]  like we're in meetings
[7073.88 --> 7075.52]  and he's part of my crew
[7075.52 --> 7077.68]  even hosting some of the videos
[7077.68 --> 7078.22]  right
[7078.22 --> 7079.54]  and the guy
[7079.54 --> 7080.50]  is wearing like
[7080.50 --> 7081.48]  ripped jeans
[7081.48 --> 7083.06]  in like business meetings
[7083.06 --> 7083.60]  I'm just like
[7083.60 --> 7085.50]  I asked him to dress decent
[7085.50 --> 7086.52]  and he even said
[7086.52 --> 7087.44]  he was going to buy clothes
[7087.44 --> 7088.14]  before the trip
[7088.14 --> 7088.94]  did not
[7088.94 --> 7090.14]  I brought my nicest pair
[7090.14 --> 7090.24]  of jeans
[7090.24 --> 7091.48]  Diesel looked so pro
[7091.48 --> 7092.44]  I brought my nicest pair of jeans
[7092.44 --> 7093.76]  I looked somewhere in between
[7093.76 --> 7095.40]  and then you looked like
[7095.40 --> 7096.04]  I swear
[7096.04 --> 7097.30]  there were hobos there
[7097.30 --> 7098.38]  that were dressed better than you
[7098.38 --> 7098.92]  they were
[7098.92 --> 7099.92]  I was kind of upset
[7099.92 --> 7101.56]  there were legitimately hobos there
[7101.56 --> 7102.82]  that were dressed better than him
[7102.82 --> 7103.50]  and by like
[7103.50 --> 7104.96]  a couple tiers above
[7104.96 --> 7105.92]  this is not like
[7105.92 --> 7106.50]  like
[7106.50 --> 7107.66]  like if I'm entry level
[7107.66 --> 7108.16]  they're like
[7108.16 --> 7109.30]  yeah
[7109.30 --> 7110.10]  yeah
[7110.10 --> 7110.78]  that was bad
[7110.78 --> 7111.66]  that was just embarrassing
[7111.66 --> 7113.50]  I bet you if I sat down with a cup
[7113.50 --> 7115.20]  I would have made the most money in Vegas
[7115.20 --> 7118.84]  probably more money than I paid you in Vegas
[7118.84 --> 7119.42]  probably
[7119.42 --> 7122.44]  oh
[7122.44 --> 7123.56]  oh
[7123.56 --> 7124.06]  yeah
[7124.06 --> 7126.12]  you know it's funny
[7126.12 --> 7127.50]  I've had some people comment
[7127.50 --> 7128.00]  that
[7128.00 --> 7129.36]  that I must be a baller
[7129.36 --> 7130.84]  because of all the YouTube money
[7130.84 --> 7131.80]  and sort of everything
[7131.80 --> 7133.22]  and I think one of the things
[7133.22 --> 7134.54]  they actually don't factor in
[7134.54 --> 7134.94]  is that
[7134.94 --> 7136.42]  we have an entire staff
[7136.42 --> 7137.16]  of three people
[7137.16 --> 7138.08]  at Linus Media Group
[7138.08 --> 7140.04]  so however much money you think
[7140.04 --> 7141.82]  that ad revenue pays out
[7141.82 --> 7142.60]  let me tell you
[7142.60 --> 7143.02]  I'm like
[7143.02 --> 7143.66]  it is
[7143.66 --> 7146.10]  it is not enough for three people to survive
[7146.10 --> 7147.66]  we're not like Jenna Marbles
[7147.66 --> 7148.38]  yeah
[7148.38 --> 7149.44]  who's a solo crew
[7149.44 --> 7150.38]  as far as I can tell
[7150.38 --> 7151.72]  and has a bajillion
[7151.72 --> 7152.06]  of bajillion views
[7152.06 --> 7153.32]  her boyfriend helps her I think
[7153.32 --> 7154.20]  and then his boy
[7154.20 --> 7155.20]  her boyfriend's channel
[7155.20 --> 7155.86]  is like
[7155.86 --> 7157.08]  as big as Linus Tech Tips
[7157.08 --> 7158.04]  they're not
[7158.04 --> 7158.76]  yeah
[7158.76 --> 7160.96]  they're not what
[7160.96 --> 7161.88]  they're not together anymore
[7161.88 --> 7162.18]  oh
[7162.18 --> 7162.90]  okay well whatever
[7162.90 --> 7164.60]  I couldn't care less about Jenna Marbles
[7164.60 --> 7165.46]  to be perfectly honest
[7165.46 --> 7166.66]  do you really follow Jenna Marbles
[7166.66 --> 7168.62]  I watch her every once in a while
[7168.62 --> 7168.92]  really
[7168.92 --> 7169.58]  those are pretty funny
[7169.58 --> 7171.84]  some of them are pretty funny
[7171.84 --> 7172.70]  a lot of the time
[7172.70 --> 7173.36]  some of them are like oh
[7173.36 --> 7174.82]  she goes just kind of crude
[7174.82 --> 7175.96]  for the sake of being crude
[7175.96 --> 7178.18]  I think that's her though
[7178.18 --> 7178.88]  yeah
[7178.88 --> 7180.78]  you're pretty crude
[7180.78 --> 7183.44]  yeah not unnecessarily
[7183.44 --> 7184.72]  sometimes
[7184.72 --> 7185.36]  on YouTube
[7185.36 --> 7186.26]  sometimes
[7186.26 --> 7187.84]  okay that's not the conversation
[7187.84 --> 7188.98]  we're having in the after party
[7188.98 --> 7191.64]  but I would say
[7191.64 --> 7192.98]  she goes like
[7192.98 --> 7193.50]  too crude
[7193.50 --> 7194.36]  just for shock value
[7194.36 --> 7195.00]  a lot of the time
[7195.00 --> 7195.78]  sometimes
[7195.78 --> 7196.80]  and I don't find that funny
[7196.80 --> 7198.16]  but she also does like skit videos
[7198.16 --> 7199.22]  okay yes
[7199.22 --> 7200.62]  which it makes more sense
[7200.62 --> 7201.34]  in skit videos
[7201.34 --> 7201.76]  okay
[7201.76 --> 7202.86]  I like I definitely see
[7202.86 --> 7203.46]  where you're coming from
[7203.46 --> 7204.42]  but yeah
[7204.42 --> 7205.48]  like I have a professional
[7205.48 --> 7206.36]  demeanor to maintain
[7206.36 --> 7207.84]  so obviously I'm not gonna
[7207.84 --> 7208.34]  say
[7208.34 --> 7214.70]  alright live stream is over
[7214.70 --> 7217.14]  every time
[7217.14 --> 7217.28]  Aww
[7217.28 --> 7217.66]  then I can do it
[7217.66 --> 7219.40]  I mean that my
[7219.40 --> 7220.48]  opposition
[7220.48 --> 7221.36]  there
[7221.36 --> 7222.42]  I think it's
[7226.52 --> 7227.00]  in скit videos
[7227.00 --> 7227.50]  as well
[7227.50 --> 7228.42]  uh
[7228.42 --> 7231.36]  the
[7231.42 --> 7231.98]  there
[7231.98 --> 7232.86]  is
[7232.86 --> 7234.10]  a
[7234.10 --> 7234.26]  there
[7234.26 --> 7234.84]  me
[7234.84 --> 7235.14]  that
