[0.00 → 6.32] Okay guys, we're live in the middle of the night and Slick is just joining me fresh from the washroom.
[6.32 → 7.86] I'm pretty sure he didn't wash his hands.
[7.86 → 10.56] I just did. I definitely did.
[10.76 → 12.80] I'm pretty sure he didn't wash his hands.
[12.80 → 13.96] I just did. Oh, god.
[14.44 → 19.10] Now he's tripping all over anything trying to defend his unhygienic behaviour.
[21.96 → 24.94] Alright, we're going to get the YouTube video live here.
[24.94 → 38.44] And this is going to be pretty fun you guys because we are going to go through a lot of the honourable mentions that we really enjoyed from the keyboard rage contest.
[38.44 → 44.44] A lot of these honourable mentions that we really enjoyed from the keyboard rage contest.
[44.44 → 50.84] There we go. Sorry about that guys. Fixed, fixed, fixed, fixed. It's all good, it's all good.
[50.84 → 54.84] Okay, let's see how many people are tuned in. Apparently we have three viewers.
[54.84 → 55.84] 67.
[55.84 → 61.84] So, yeah. Okay, let's kick this off. Nerd Rage style.
[61.84 → 68.84] Here is our playlist of the honourable mentions starting with this guy.
[68.84 → 73.84] You know what, let's not do it like that. Let's do it like this.
[73.84 → 77.84] So, if I... Actually, you guys can see the whole thing. There we go.
[80.84 → 81.84] Audio, remember?
[81.84 → 82.84] Oh yeah, audio.
[82.84 → 84.84] Oh no, they can hear it.
[84.84 → 85.84] Cool.
[87.84 → 90.84] So this is Gandalf the White, apparently.
[91.84 → 95.84] And, uh, Slick, feel free to put your commentary in here.
[95.84 → 105.84] This was nice and creative, but I had a problem with it being environmentally friendly because of this part.
[105.84 → 108.84] And in the rules we did say it had to be environmentally friendly.
[108.84 → 110.84] But still, I enjoyed it.
[110.84 → 111.84] But still, it was perfect.
[111.84 → 112.84] Honourable mention.
[112.84 → 113.84] Yeah.
[113.84 → 122.84] This one same thing, we had a bit of an environmental friendliness problem going on here.
[122.84 → 123.84] Just a bit.
[123.84 → 125.84] But this guy's awesome.
[125.84 → 126.84] So epic.
[126.84 → 127.84] So epic.
[130.84 → 131.84] Paywall.
[132.84 → 133.84] Just...
[133.84 → 134.84] That's amazing.
[134.84 → 135.84] That's the environmental issue.
[135.84 → 140.84] He says he cleaned up all the pieces, but, um, I'm pretty sure burning computers is...
[141.84 → 142.84] He drags it away.
[143.84 → 144.84] So good, but...
[144.84 → 147.84] Yeah, burning computers is bad for the environment.
[147.84 → 148.84] Yeah.
[148.84 → 149.84] Like, pretty bad.
[149.84 → 151.84] Hold on, I'm going to put this here.
[151.84 → 153.84] Uh, yeah, and yeah, we're tired.
[153.84 → 155.84] And yes, Slick has IBS.
[157.84 → 158.84] Yeah, that's a Game Boy Advance.
[158.84 → 160.84] You know what, here, you should come sit over here.
[160.84 → 161.84] And then we'll just kinda...
[161.84 → 163.84] We'll kinda get all cozy.
[163.84 → 167.84] So that they can see both of us and the videos at the same time.
[167.84 → 168.84] Let's go to the next video.
[168.84 → 169.84] I love this one.
[169.84 → 170.84] His facial expression is so good.
[170.84 → 171.84] Oh.
[171.84 → 172.84] I love this one.
[172.84 → 173.84] I love this one.
[173.84 → 175.84] His facial expression is so good.
[175.84 → 176.84] Oh.
[176.84 → 177.84] Oh.
[177.84 → 178.84] Oh.
[178.84 → 179.84] Oh.
[179.84 → 180.84] Oh.
[180.84 → 182.84] Oh.
[182.84 → 183.84] Oh.
[183.84 → 184.84] Oh.
[184.84 → 185.84] Oh.
[185.84 → 186.84] Sorry guys.
[186.84 → 187.84] I'm really sorry.
[187.84 → 188.84] I have to pause this.
[188.84 → 202.84] I just realized on the YouTube video announcing us doing this, I didn't put the link to the Twitch stream.
[202.84 → 215.84] To the Twitch stream.
[215.84 → 217.84] To the Twitch stream.
[217.84 → 219.84] Oh.
[219.84 → 223.84] Save changes.
[223.84 → 230.84] Let's see how many people have complained about it already.
[230.84 → 241.84] Okay, people are just saying that Slick is sexy. 10 out of 10. Okay, yup. Okay then.
[241.84 → 247.84] It's all good. And back to the video.
[247.84 → 253.84] Hey! Linus. What? GTX 680. No! What? Aw, crap.
[253.84 → 258.84] I don't think I like that one quite as much as Slick. Here, you should move over a little bit.
[258.84 → 262.84] Your face is cut off, and I don't want to put my arm around.
[262.84 → 266.84] That one was really creative. I thought it was perfect.
[266.84 → 270.84] It's also 39 seconds long. Yeah.
[270.84 → 274.84] And I just didn't like it as much as you did, but it was funny. It made me smile.
[274.84 → 278.84] I like Garry's Mod stuff. It was way too long. I liked it a lot.
[278.84 → 282.84] Hello again, I'm Rodney Renner. Welcome to another video review.
[282.84 → 284.84] Unfortunately, the motherboard tray is not removable.
[284.84 → 287.84] I'm not going to talk about Linus at all. I'm not going to talk about the quality of his videos.
[287.84 → 289.84] I'm not going to talk about the quantity of his videos.
[289.84 → 292.84] Hey guys, it's Tiny Tom Logan back with another video for you.
[292.84 → 297.84] And today we're going to be taking a look at the Corsair Vengeance K90.
[297.84 → 302.84] While Linus is up there, he's got so many subscribers. He does a perfect job. I have a lot of respect for him.
[302.84 → 312.84] So yeah... that one was...
[312.84 → 317.60] That one was kind of hilarious because of seeing all the other YouTubers.
[317.60 → 319.46] Yeah, a lot of inside jokes.
[319.46 → 320.46] Yeah.
[320.46 → 322.46] That made it tough.
[322.46 → 323.46] Yeah.
[323.46 → 324.46] But no nerve rage.
[324.46 → 325.46] No rage.
[325.46 → 326.46] Yeah, there's no rage in that one.
[326.46 → 328.46] So it's pretty challenging.
[328.46 → 330.46] It's hard to make that the winner.
[330.46 → 332.46] Okay, next one.
[332.46 → 334.46] Yeah, there's a lot of cool inside jokes in there.
[334.46 → 337.46] Yeah, especially the removable motherboard trays.
[337.46 → 340.46] I thought this was a normal live in this video.
[340.46 → 341.46] Oh, this one's good.
[341.46 → 343.46] Oh, hold on, we have to go back to the beginning.
[343.46 → 344.46] This one's amazing.
[344.46 → 348.46] You thought this was a normal Linus video?
[348.46 → 351.46] You thought wrong.
[351.46 → 356.46] Linus Sebastian actually worships the devil.
[356.46 → 362.46] The proof is everywhere.
[362.46 → 369.46] Mother of God.
[369.46 → 370.46] Oh, this is amazing.
[370.46 → 371.46] This is amazing.
[371.46 → 372.46] This is amazing.
[372.46 → 373.46] This is amazing.
[373.46 → 376.46] This is amazing.
[376.46 → 378.46] So good.
[378.46 → 381.46] Oh, again, no rage.
[381.46 → 384.46] But just friggin' amazing.
[384.46 → 385.46] Just awesome.
[385.46 → 386.46] I loved it.
[386.46 → 387.46] Yeah.
[387.46 → 388.46] Yeah.
[388.46 → 389.46] Yeah.
[389.46 → 390.46] Yeah.
[390.46 → 391.46] Yeah.
[391.46 → 392.46] Okay.
[392.46 → 393.46] Let's go to the next one.
[393.46 → 394.46] So good.
[394.46 → 395.46] So good.
[395.46 → 396.46] So good.
[396.46 → 401.46] This one's just so creepy.
[401.46 → 403.46] So creepy, guys.
[403.46 → 405.46] Okay, so hold on.
[405.46 → 407.46] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[407.46 → 408.46] There was like three white dudes.
[408.46 → 409.46] Oh, no.
[409.46 → 411.46] There was a white dude, an Asian guy, and a white dude.
[411.46 → 414.46] And now there's like a girl, a black guy, and a white guy.
[414.46 → 416.46] It's like, what just happened?
[420.46 → 421.46] See, look at the hands.
[421.46 → 424.46] And there we go.
[424.46 → 425.46] There we go.
[425.46 → 426.46] And like laptops and stuff like that.
[426.46 → 427.46] Dude, you saw hard at soul.
[427.46 → 428.46] It's not me.
[428.46 → 429.46] It's my keyboard.
[429.46 → 430.46] I come here from Korea to lose.
[430.46 → 431.46] Who are you?
[431.46 → 432.46] Who are you?
[432.46 → 433.46] Who are you people?
[434.46 → 436.46] The boss and ninja!
[436.46 → 438.46] The boss and ninja!
[443.46 → 445.46] So this is ridiculous.
[447.46 → 448.46] Yeah.
[448.46 → 450.46] I mean, what do we say?
[450.46 → 453.46] The randomness level is pretty high.
[453.46 → 454.46] So much random.
[454.46 → 457.46] Yeah, so very much random.
[457.46 → 458.46] Okay, next one.
[458.46 → 459.46] These are all...
[459.46 → 460.46] Okay, to be clear, guys.
[460.46 → 463.46] These are all honourable mansions.
[463.46 → 464.46] These are not the winners.
[476.46 → 478.46] The peace player, double arrow shot.
[478.46 → 479.46] Easy.
[479.46 → 480.46] Ah!
[480.46 → 485.46] This part was really well done.
[485.46 → 490.46] I love that.
[490.46 → 491.46] Massive jumps, though.
[491.46 → 492.46] Yeah, I really enjoyed this one.
[492.46 → 493.46] It's just the...
[493.46 → 494.46] I mean, when you guys see the winners, you'll see what we mean.
[494.46 → 495.46] I mean, I wish we could give a keyboard to everyone.
[495.46 → 496.46] We're giving...
[496.46 → 498.46] Yeah, we ended up giving away more than five keyboards, even though I have no idea where the
[498.46 → 500.46] other two are going to come from.
[500.46 → 501.46] All right, here we go.
[501.46 → 502.46] Next one.
[502.46 → 503.46] Oh, this guy.
[503.46 → 504.46] Oh, okay.

[509.46 → 510.46] This guy.
[510.46 → 511.46] This guy.
[511.46 → 512.46] Oh, this guy.
[512.46 → 513.46] Okay, this one, like, there was no rage, but it's so cool.
[513.46 → 514.46] Yeah.
[514.46 → 515.46] It's just so cool.
[515.46 → 516.46] Check this out.
[516.46 → 517.46] Oh, volume up.
[517.46 → 519.46] Nice for unboxing using Omni.

[521.46 → 544.46] Knife for unboxing using only PC parts, such as this old broken disc, this PSU, and this
[544.46 → 545.46] RAM.
[545.46 → 555.96] So I'm plugging in, and let's start.

[566.46 → 567.46] I know.
[567.46 → 570.46] That guy's really cool, but it just wasn't applicable.
[570.46 → 571.46] It wasn't really rage.
[571.46 → 572.46] Yeah.

[605.46 → 606.46] That was epic.
[606.46 → 607.46] This one's just kinda creepy.
[607.46 → 608.46] Hello, my sacrifice.

[636.58 → 637.68] to-
[637.68 → 638.30] keep in the hallways.
[638.30 → 645.30] like bread

[657.30 → 659.30] ok next one
[659.30 → 670.30] this one's probably pretty hard to follow watching it in a little window here but
[670.30 → 674.30] it's like a pokey battle between a mouse and a keyboard
[674.30 → 677.30] and a mouse is hard
[677.30 → 682.30] oh no chicken he hit himself in the green
[682.30 → 687.30] or strangle his not made right there
[687.30 → 690.30] he's a netball

[697.30 → 700.30] ok next one here we go
[700.30 → 702.30] oh
[702.30 → 706.30] and since I stopped using the pieces
[706.30 → 709.30] i just always chop the fuck-up
[709.30 → 712.30] to the piece of little hand
[712.30 → 714.30] and then my keyboard will be enough
[714.30 → 717.30] to the house
[717.30 → 718.30] to the house
[718.30 → 719.30] to the house

[737.30 → 738.30] yeah
[738.30 → 740.30] I always typed with my butt
[740.30 → 742.30] I always typed with my butt too
[742.30 → 745.30] welcome to this great tech tips video on this generic membrane keyboard
[745.30 → 749.30] this keyboard features sticky nonvolatile keys with no wrist rests or backlit keys
[749.30 → 750.30] and the build quality on this thing is really poor, so there's no way you can kill man with it
[750.30 → 757.30] this keyboard is meant for your cheapos out there who do not want to buy a quality keyboard and
[757.30 → 758.30] what's that camera
[758.30 → 759.30] what's that guy
[759.30 → 761.30] so apparently this keyboard is not going to be sold anymore because of how much it sucks
[761.30 → 765.30] so I guess you guys are going to have to go out there and buy a quality enthusiast keyboard such as the Coimbra came out here
[765.30 → 778.30], so thank you for watching, and please subscribe to grant tech tips for more unboxing reviews and other computer videos
[778.30 → 780.30] the use of the background music

[783.30 → 785.30] the um
[785.30 → 787.30] a lot of little inside things
[787.30 → 791.30] the little thing almost everything he said has come out of my mouth at some point during a video
[791.30 → 792.30] the keyboard killing thing
[792.30 → 793.30] yep
[793.30 → 795.30] whispering cameraman like everything was
[795.30 → 799.30] the one thing he screwed up is he had a proper transition when he did a random cut
[799.30 → 801.30] because I never do
[801.30 → 805.30] we are more ghetto than him in this place
[805.30 → 812.30] oh this one I really like this was one of the earliest entries but some of the stuff that came along after it was better
[812.30 → 814.30] ok here we go

[818.30 → 820.30] nerd base
[820.30 → 821.30] style
[821.30 → 828.30] you know this one probably would have done better if it was a good one of the most
[828.30 → 830.30] um
[830.30 → 835.30] like timed the cuts with the music a little bit better like been a little bit more polished
[835.30 → 837.30] it seemed a little bit rushed but I just thought it was pretty funny I mean Gangnam Style
[837.30 → 839.30] is hard to give points for creativity
[839.30 → 841.30] right
[841.30 → 842.30] yeah
[842.30 → 843.30] yeah
[843.30 → 845.30] yeah
[845.30 → 846.30] yeah
[846.30 → 847.30] yeah
[847.30 → 848.30] yeah
[848.30 → 849.30] yeah
[849.30 → 850.30] yeah
[850.30 → 851.30] yeah
[851.30 → 852.30] yeah
[852.30 → 853.30] yeah
[853.30 → 854.30] yeah
[854.30 → 855.30] yeah
[855.30 → 856.30] yeah
[856.30 → 857.30] yeah
[857.30 → 858.30] yeah
[858.30 → 859.30] yeah
[859.30 → 860.30] yeah
[860.30 → 861.30] yeah
[861.30 → 862.30] yeah
[862.30 → 863.30] yeah
[863.30 → 868.30] yeah
[868.30 → 882.30] yeah
[882.30 → 883.30] yeah
[883.30 → 885.30] yeah
[885.30 → 886.30] yeah
[886.30 → 905.90] I really liked that one, that was perfect.
[905.90 → 910.14] He's one of a couple entries that I'm sort of afraid if I would have to tell him in person
[910.14 → 910.82] that I didn't win.
[912.86 → 914.36] But I really enjoyed it.
[914.36 → 916.36] Yeah.
[916.36 → 921.52] It's not a family guy rip off, man.
[921.52 → 922.52] Come on, man.
[922.52 → 924.92] We're not watching all the videos now.
[924.92 → 926.72] Yeah, no, we're not watching all the videos.
[926.72 → 928.04] This is just the honourable mentions.
[928.04 → 929.10] We got a playlist going here.
[929.10 → 933.92] We got about 12 more videos to go, and then we're going to move on to the winners.
[933.92 → 934.92] Yeah.
[934.92 → 940.92] So you guys can't really see this, but he's trying to type awesome, and it's MZ.
[940.92 → 950.92] It seems like the obvious solution.
[950.92 → 958.08] It's the obvious solution about that.
[958.08 → 965.24] I can't believe it actually does.
[965.24 → 970.24] I liked the music and the timing of how he puts everything on the table.
[970.24 → 971.24] Yeah.
[971.24 → 972.40] I liked the style.
[972.40 → 973.40] It was fun.
[973.40 → 974.40] I enjoyed it.
[974.40 → 975.40] But like I said, the winners are very strong entries.
[975.40 → 976.40] Yeah.
[976.40 → 983.40] Okay, so we unclip these, and then I guess it will extend for us.
[983.40 → 984.40] Oh, there we go.
[984.40 → 985.40] There we go.
[985.40 → 986.40] That's better.
[986.40 → 987.40] Once we unclip those, we can get a better idea.
[987.40 → 988.40] What kind of height we're going to see with this thing.
[988.40 → 989.40] Okay.
[989.40 → 991.40] You guys might not be able to see this, but this is someone ragging on me for wearing socks
[991.40 → 992.40] and sandals.
[992.40 → 993.40] It's just a huge wall of socks and sandals text.
[993.40 → 994.40] Underrated, right?
[994.40 → 995.40] Underrated like you have.
[995.40 → 999.40] Leave Linus tech tips alone.
[999.40 → 1001.40] It's the middle of winter.
[1001.40 → 1005.40] You can't wear sandals without socks.
[1005.40 → 1017.40] Just leave him alone.
[1017.40 → 1028.40] Yeah, it's an older reference, but always a good one.
[1028.40 → 1030.40] Good old Chris Cocker.
[1030.40 → 1031.40] He did it, really well.
[1031.40 → 1034.40] Oby the Queen.
[1034.40 → 1041.40] Kevin looks like on a normal day he'd clean up pretty nice and be kind of respectable looking.
[1041.40 → 1043.40] But then with like this.
[1043.40 → 1047.40] He's ridiculous.
[1047.40 → 1051.40] Okay, here we go. Next one.
[1064.40 → 1070.40] On this star pool.
[1070.40 → 1082.40] And the answers that you feel are probably ready.
[1082.40 → 1085.40] I love the style of this one. It's so good.
[1085.40 → 1091.40] And honestly, Lifetime Productions is one of my favourite entries over a couple of contests now.
[1091.40 → 1093.40] Yeah, we should show you some of them.
[1093.40 → 1096.40] Yeah, I'm gonna play this one. This was from the Unbox Yourself video.
[1096.40 → 1099.40] Linus showed me a bunch of them.
[1099.40 → 1101.40] This one was my favourite one.
[1101.40 → 1102.40] Very good.
[1114.40 → 1116.40] I love your books.
[1121.40 → 1136.40] Oh my goodness. So good.
[1136.40 → 1140.40] And I feel bad. He kind of narrowly missed the cut again.
[1140.40 → 1144.40] But there is a consolation prize. There is a consolation prize again.
[1144.40 → 1148.40] And he got a consolation prize last time. I think he won like a $50 gift card.
[1148.40 → 1150.40] And this is a pretty epic consolation prize.
[1150.40 → 1151.40] Yeah, it's pretty good.
[1158.40 → 1159.40] I like this one.
[1159.40 → 1160.40] I like this one.
[1160.40 → 1162.40] AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
[1165.40 → 1167.40] Because guitars need RAM.
[1167.40 → 1168.40] Right?
[1170.40 → 1171.40] There's more latency on his fingers.
[1171.40 → 1172.40] Of course.
[1172.40 → 1173.40] It's a Cas9.
[1173.40 → 1174.40] Cas8.
[1178.40 → 1182.40] I forgot what that tape is.
[1182.40 → 1183.40] Oh yeah.
[1183.40 → 1184.40] What's wrong with this keyboard?
[1184.40 → 1185.40] Oh I like...
[1186.40 → 1188.40] Oh my God.
[1190.40 → 1191.40] ZEN.
[1191.40 → 1198.40] Oh yeah, what's wrong with this keyboard?
[1198.40 → 1200.40] Oh, I like this one.
[1200.40 → 1203.40] Oh my god.
[1203.40 → 1205.40] Oh my god.
[1205.40 → 1207.40] Sam, come here.
[1207.40 → 1208.40] What?
[1208.40 → 1209.40] Come here, Sam.
[1209.40 → 1211.40] I found the problem with the keyboard.
[1211.40 → 1212.40] You see the crack inside?
[1212.40 → 1213.40] That?
[1213.40 → 1214.40] That crack right there?
[1214.40 → 1215.40] Yeah.
[1215.40 → 1216.40] Right there.
[1216.40 → 1219.40] You didn't get a Corsair.
[1219.40 → 1222.40] The voice acting and the timing were perfect.
[1222.40 → 1224.40] Yeah, the timing's great.
[1224.40 → 1226.40] I love the concept.
[1226.40 → 1228.40] Just love the timing more than anything else.
[1228.40 → 1230.40] It's like overreaction much.
[1230.40 → 1232.40] Yeah, right there.
[1234.40 → 1236.40] Alright, next one.
[1236.40 → 1237.40] Here we go.
[1237.40 → 1238.40] Seven more.
[1238.40 → 1239.40] Seven more.
[1239.40 → 1243.40] Yes, I like this one.
[1243.40 → 1244.40] You failed.
[1244.40 → 1247.40] I never really was on your side.
[1247.40 → 1261.40] I should have done this long ago.
[1261.40 → 1262.40] Um.
[1262.40 → 1264.40] What the fuck?
[1264.40 → 1271.40] I liked this one, I think more.
[1271.40 → 1272.40] Um.
[1272.40 → 1275.40] I really liked the WTF boom reference.
[1275.40 → 1276.40] Yeah.
[1276.40 → 1277.40] That was awesome.
[1277.40 → 1280.40] And I liked people that did their own animations.
[1280.40 → 1281.40] Yeah.
[1281.40 → 1283.40] I thought this one was perfect as well.
[1283.40 → 1285.40] Okay, next one.
[1285.40 → 1286.40] Here we go.
[1286.40 → 1287.40] Pausing.
[1287.40 → 1290.40] Oh, this one I really liked the style.
[1290.40 → 1291.40] He did all the artwork himself.
[1291.40 → 1293.40] All the posters.
[1293.40 → 1295.40] Yeah, all the posters.
[1295.40 → 1299.40] He's like photoshopped them to work in the word Corsair, which is pretty neat.
[1299.40 → 1302.40] It's like classic movies and stuff.
[1302.40 → 1303.40] Very cool.
[1303.40 → 1305.40] And then Raging in Progress.
[1305.40 → 1307.40] How could we know this amazing video?
[1307.40 → 1308.40] Either Wolf or Ornate Pops is ASEM, you can reboot the dot com.
[1308.40 → 1310.40] How could we know that little ruler hangs out?
[1310.40 → 1311.40] How could we know this?
[1311.40 → 1314.40] How could we know when we have gotten going to the top?
[1314.40 → 1315.40] How could we know it now?
[1315.40 → 1320.40] How chant in the world we're seeing these videos, this is the most 다양한 archetypes when understanding
[1320.40 → 1321.40] of everything.
[1321.40 → 1323.40] And then when we're finding out options.
[1323.40 → 1328.40] Next time, Builds, I have a place somewhere.
[1328.40 → 1329.38] Do we know that a neat thing?
[1329.40 → 1331.38] Way to help the audience?
[1331.38 → 1332.38] How could we know that?
[1332.38 → 1333.38] Listen, our businesses swing answers.
[1333.38 → 1338.54] I like that, like, go to his description.
[1338.54 → 1339.54] Yeah, here.
[1339.54 → 1348.14] So he says, uh, vocals and lyrics are by him, animations by him, um, music by, um, see this
[1348.14 → 1351.66] one I don't know where it came from, but overall I just really enjoyed that video.
[1351.66 → 1354.42] He did a lot of it and the posters were perfect.
[1354.42 → 1355.70] Yeah, it was a nice touch.
[1355.70 → 1357.70] It was just those little things, right?
[1357.70 → 1358.70] Yeah.
[1358.70 → 1360.70] Uh, let's go up and touch.
[1360.70 → 1361.70] Okay, five more videos.
[1363.38 → 1365.38] Ahhhh!
[1365.38 → 1366.38] Ahhhh!
[1366.38 → 1368.38] Ahhhh!
[1368.38 → 1369.38] Ahhhh!
[1369.38 → 1370.38] Ahhhh!
[1370.38 → 1374.38] That sounds so random.
[1374.38 → 1375.38] Yeah!
[1375.38 → 1380.38] Ahhhh!
[1380.38 → 1384.38] I can't believe I can be a person.
[1384.38 → 1386.38] Ahhhh!
[1386.38 → 1387.38] Ahhhh!
[1387.38 → 1388.38] Ahhhh!
[1388.38 → 1390.38] Ahhhh!
[1390.38 → 1391.38] Ahhhh!
[1391.38 → 1392.38] Ahhhh!
[1392.38 → 1396.22] I guess there was a plot here that we had a little bit of trouble following.
[1396.22 → 1397.22] Yeah.
[1397.22 → 1399.50] I mean, the effects were obviously awesome.
[1399.50 → 1401.14] I don't know what he bombs at the end.
[1401.14 → 1402.14] There's nothing there.
[1402.14 → 1403.70] It's like an intersection or something.
[1403.70 → 1405.70] Then he just kills someone's random car.
[1405.70 → 1406.70] Yeah.
[1406.70 → 1408.70] Well, I mean, it's rage.
[1408.70 → 1409.70] Right, right.
[1409.70 → 1412.70] But it's more like an act of terrorism at that point.
[1412.70 → 1414.70] He's trying to start a war.
[1414.70 → 1415.70] He's really mad.
[1415.70 → 1420.70] We liked it again, but the panel of judges couldn't agree on this one, so we're moving
[1420.70 → 1421.70] on.
[1421.70 → 1425.02] This one I really liked.
[1425.02 → 1426.02] Right now.
[1426.02 → 1428.22] Okay, for me, it's just a timing thing.
[1428.22 → 1431.46] And this was one of the first submissions again, but just some of the stuff that came along
[1431.46 → 1434.02] later was pretty good, but yeah.
[1434.02 → 1439.38] Okay, I better turn the volume down a little bit on this one.
[1439.38 → 1442.38] Right now.
[1442.38 → 1443.94] This is Sparta!
[1443.94 → 1444.94] Yeah.
[1444.94 → 1445.94] Yeah.
[1445.94 → 1447.26] I loved this one.
[1447.26 → 1448.78] The timing was perfect.
[1448.78 → 1449.78] Yeah.
[1449.78 → 1450.58] The timing was good.
[1450.58 → 1451.58] He was really quick to get it and put together.
[1451.58 → 1455.90] He uploaded it on October 21st, which was the same day or next day.
[1455.90 → 1456.90] Yeah.
[1456.90 → 1457.90] Crazy.
[1457.90 → 1458.90] The next one.
[1458.90 → 1461.22] This one was so good, but not really great.
[1461.22 → 1462.22] I love this one.
[1462.22 → 1465.54] So what can you do with your own keyboard if you get a brand new Corset Vengeance K90?
[1465.54 → 1468.86] Well, you can hang it on your wall.
[1468.86 → 1469.86] That smells so good.
[1469.86 → 1470.86] So good.
[1470.86 → 1471.86] So good.
[1471.86 → 1472.86] You can make a blending keyboard.
[1472.86 → 1473.86] Oh yeah.
[1473.86 → 1474.86] Yeah.
[1474.86 → 1475.86] This is the same.
[1475.86 → 1477.86] If you get a brand new Corset Vengeance K90, you can hang it on your wall.
[1477.86 → 1478.86] That smells so good.
[1478.86 → 1479.86] So good.
[1479.86 → 1481.86] You can make a blending keyboard.
[1481.86 → 1482.86] You can make a blending keyboard.
[1482.86 → 1483.86] Yeah.
[1483.86 → 1484.86] It's the same.
[1484.86 → 1485.86] You can do it with your own keyboard.
[1485.86 → 1487.86] It was a good idea.
[1487.86 → 1488.86] I really did.
[1488.86 → 1489.86] It was a good idea.
[1489.86 → 1490.86] Yeah.
[1490.86 → 1491.86] I really did.
[1491.86 → 1492.86] I really did.
[1492.86 → 1493.86] That's a good idea.
[1493.86 → 1494.86] Yeah.
[1494.86 → 1495.86] I really did.
[1495.86 → 1496.86] I really did.
[1496.86 → 1497.86] Yeah.
[1497.86 → 1508.86] a bling, or a key bling, or a key bracelet, or whatever you want.
[1508.86 → 1512.86] I really liked that one.
[1512.86 → 1518.86] It was like so, the style was awesome and just, yeah I really liked it.
[1518.86 → 1520.86] Please enjoy the consolation prize.
[1520.86 → 1526.86] Yeah, please enjoy the consolation prize really, because it was awesome, there wasn't really any rage in it.
[1526.86 → 1532.86] Yeah, like he took apart a keyboard, but he didn't destroy it, he could have easily put it back together.
[1532.86 → 1534.86] Well, yeah, there's just no anger.
[1534.86 → 1538.86] I didn't even say, people didn't have to destroy keyboards, they just had to be angry.
[1538.86 → 1540.86] That's true, very true.
[1540.86 → 1542.86] Or rage, nerd rage.
[1542.86 → 1543.86] They had to be mad.
[1543.86 → 1545.86] But that was more like nerd, awesome creativity.
[1545.86 → 1547.86] Yeah, yeah.
[1547.86 → 1550.86] Rock it, shh.
[1552.86 → 1555.86] Oh, I really liked this one.
[1555.86 → 1556.86] Oh, yeah.
[1556.86 → 1557.86] Hi.
[1557.86 → 1559.86] It's the kid's up and leaves.
[1559.86 → 1560.86] I don't know.
[1560.86 → 1561.86] The irony is how many times I've had that happen with the K90.
[1561.86 → 1562.86] It's a USB keyboard.
[1562.86 → 1563.86] Yeah.
[1563.86 → 1564.86] Some other boards don't like it, you can't get into the box.
[1564.86 → 1565.86] It's the K90.
[1565.86 → 1566.86] It's the K90.
[1566.86 → 1567.86] It's the K90.
[1567.86 → 1568.86] It's the K90.
[1568.86 → 1569.86] OK.
[1569.86 → 1570.86] What it's for?
[1570.86 → 1571.86] Yeah.
[1571.86 → 1585.86] So it's–
[1585.86 → 1586.86] Oh, you're trying to get this is!
[1586.86 → 1587.86] There's not that planet.
[1587.86 → 1589.86] Yeah, why were we thus if you realized that someone's a billionayeaudio, right?
[1589.86 → 1591.86] Some other boards don't like it
[1591.86 → 1593.12] You can't get into the BIOS
[1593.12 → 1594.44] No matter how many times you press it
[1594.44 → 1597.10] You're just trying to install an operating
[1597.10 → 1598.62] Or you're trying to change settings
[1598.62 → 1599.96] But it just keeps going on the OS
[1599.96 → 1604.30] Okay, last one for the honourable mentions here guys
[1619.86 → 1634.94] Okay, and then his description
[1634.94 → 1635.98] Yeah, his description
[1635.98 → 1639.00] He specifically says he did not use WD-40
[1639.00 → 1641.16] Because air dusters are ozone-friendly
[1641.16 → 1643.64] And he figured out how to make it there without that
[1643.64 → 1644.82] So that's pretty cool
[1644.82 → 1647.24] That's in line with sort of our theme
[1647.24 → 1649.40] About how things have to be somewhat eco-friendly
[1649.40 → 1654.36] Well, not blatantly destroying the environment at least
[1654.36 → 1656.58] Like the one who kind of lit the whole thing on fire
[1656.58 → 1657.96] And dragged it behind the truck
[1657.96 → 1660.52] Okay
[1660.52 → 1662.14] Winner's circle
[1662.14 → 1664.88] It is time to move on
[1664.88 → 1667.58] To the winners
[1667.58 → 1672.64] Yeah, winners
[1672.64 → 1673.24] Here we go
[1673.24 → 1674.86] So how do I
[1674.86 → 1675.54] Oh yeah, play all
[1675.54 → 1677.20] First one
[1677.20 → 1707.18] Oh yeah, play all
[1707.20 → 1710.66] Okay, I don't know if you guys can read that at the end
[1710.66 → 1713.82] But the keyboard letters
[1713.82 → 1715.54] Say help
[1715.54 → 1717.62] That one was just like
[1717.62 → 1719.20] This one was just so disturbing
[1719.20 → 1721.72] There's a help at the end there
[1721.72 → 1724.74] The only thing that could have made it creepier
[1724.74 → 1726.72] Is if he had like blood splatters around
[1726.72 → 1727.94] Or something, yeah
[1727.94 → 1730.94] It's like what could make someone angry enough to do that
[1730.94 → 1731.22] Yeah
[1731.22 → 1732.06] To a keyboard
[1732.06 → 1732.74] That's like
[1732.74 → 1735.12] If anyone has seen Law-Abiding Citizen
[1735.12 → 1736.36] That's like the scene where he
[1736.36 → 1736.66] Yes
[1736.66 → 1736.94] Yeah
[1736.94 → 1737.80] Yes, I have
[1737.80 → 1738.22] Yeah
[1738.22 → 1739.80] And that's why this is
[1739.80 → 1741.28] Like it fit
[1741.28 → 1744.16] Our big things were creativity, style and
[1744.16 → 1744.76] Humour
[1744.76 → 1745.22] Humour
[1745.22 → 1746.48] There was no real humour
[1746.48 → 1747.02] But
[1747.02 → 1747.04] But
[1747.04 → 1747.06] But
[1747.06 → 1748.26] Oozed
[1748.26 → 1749.36] Style and creativity
[1749.36 → 1750.72] Really liked the style
[1750.72 → 1751.32] Really, really, really did
[1751.32 → 1754.86] Yeah
[1754.86 → 1761.86] Alright, here we go
[1761.86 → 1762.54] Next one
[1762.54 → 1766.76] Oh my goodness, I love this one.
[1767.60 → 1768.32] Okay, okay.
[1768.98 → 1771.80] Okay, it's just, guys, stick with this one until the end.
[1771.92 → 1775.52] Because it starts out kind of lame, and then it gets just perfect.
[1775.74 → 1776.54] The timing's perfect.
[1782.54 → 1782.78] What?
[1782.78 → 1812.76] Oh.
[1812.76 → 1816.52] So no one else really got into the consequences of destroying your keyboard?
[1816.86 → 1817.54] Yeah, yeah.
[1817.82 → 1820.36] And the timing here at the end is just perfect.
[1820.52 → 1821.50] Facial expression and everything.
[1822.86 → 1823.62] Oh, where's my keyboard?
[1825.66 → 1825.90] Oh.
[1827.64 → 1832.66] Yet is still enough of a nerd to keep using the computer.
[1832.66 → 1833.46] Keep using the computer.
[1833.94 → 1834.62] Don't give up.
[1835.04 → 1835.68] Just use the...
[1835.68 → 1839.94] I mean, if you've ever used the on-screen keyboard on your desktop, it's like the worst thing ever.
[1841.44 → 1841.92] Great.
[1842.14 → 1842.66] Love it.
[1842.76 → 1843.30] Perfect.
[1843.62 → 1843.90] Yeah.
[1846.80 → 1847.78] Okay, next one.
[1848.56 → 1849.10] Oh, wrong one.
[1849.20 → 1849.50] Wrong one.
[1849.58 → 1850.02] Ah, ah.
[1850.28 → 1850.76] Ah, ah.
[1851.32 → 1851.54] Okay.
[1851.78 → 1852.60] This one was epic.
[1853.38 → 1853.86] Oh, I know.
[1857.44 → 1858.18] You know what?
[1858.22 → 1860.96] We should really be doing the winners in full screen.
[1861.86 → 1862.42] All right, yeah.
[1863.10 → 1863.94] Where's my full screen?
[1864.10 → 1864.50] There we go.
[1865.84 → 1866.14] Okay.
[1866.30 → 1867.70] Winners in full screen from now on.
[1869.50 → 1870.14] Can we do HD?
[1870.76 → 1871.04] Yep.
[1871.04 → 1871.78] Do HD.
[1871.78 → 1872.92] Here we go.
[1873.06 → 1873.38] Here we go.
[1873.38 → 1880.68] How sweet it is to be loved by you.
[1882.04 → 1883.32] I'm great, calculator.
[1885.64 → 1887.04] Aw, I love you too.
[1887.72 → 1888.20] All right.
[1888.36 → 1890.02] Are you ready to do some calculations?
[1890.02 → 1894.28] What's that calculator?
[1894.28 → 1894.96] What?
[1894.96 → 1895.96] What?
[1895.96 → 1898.90] No, that's wrong.
[1899.32 → 1900.50] I thought you were my friend.
[1900.50 → 1905.88] And he killed me.
[1905.88 → 1906.84] Well, guess that happens.
[1906.84 → 1907.50] No, no, no, no, no.
[1907.54 → 1908.28] I don't want autoplay.
[1908.60 → 1909.64] How do I turn off autoplay?
[1910.18 → 1910.82] Guess that happens.
[1911.60 → 1912.28] It's off.
[1912.64 → 1913.10] That's weird.
[1913.28 → 1914.26] Yeah, that's bizarre.
[1914.36 → 1914.56] Okay, okay.
[1914.86 → 1915.20] Okay.
[1915.48 → 1916.24] So let's go back.
[1916.42 → 1916.76] Let's go back.
[1918.14 → 1918.80] Wait, hold on.
[1919.54 → 1920.02] There we go.
[1920.02 → 1922.54] Which scene?
[1922.54 → 1923.14] Okay.
[1928.04 → 1929.12] I'm confused.
[1929.46 → 1930.46] My scenes aren't working.
[1931.82 → 1932.18] Oh, yeah.
[1932.24 → 1932.64] There we go.
[1932.76 → 1933.30] Okay, we're back.
[1933.82 → 1935.46] So, yeah.
[1935.64 → 1938.18] A couple of things that I loved about this one.
[1938.56 → 1940.78] Right at the beginning, there's a bunch of Corsair stuff under his bed.
[1940.86 → 1941.20] Right there.
[1941.20 → 1941.40] Yeah, see?
[1941.76 → 1943.10] A pile of Corsair stuff under his bed.
[1943.10 → 1944.02] Old school Dominators.
[1944.16 → 1944.36] Yep.
[1944.72 → 1946.32] Old DDR2 Dominators.
[1946.50 → 1946.66] Yeah.
[1946.98 → 1947.16] Okay.
[1948.14 → 1948.50] Here.
[1948.76 → 1949.16] Hold on.
[1949.40 → 1949.92] Portal Gun.
[1950.64 → 1951.70] What else we got here?
[1951.80 → 1952.66] That's epic.
[1953.42 → 1953.98] Nothing yet.
[1954.06 → 1954.46] Okay, hold on.
[1954.48 → 1955.14] I think it's really Portal Gun.
[1955.18 → 1955.60] Here we go.
[1955.82 → 1956.32] Wait for it.
[1957.84 → 1958.36] It's awesome.
[1958.48 → 1960.30] Just like awesome Lego going on here.
[1960.42 → 1961.96] Oh, did we miss the...
[1961.96 → 1962.14] Yeah.
[1962.38 → 1962.52] Yeah.
[1963.04 → 1963.66] Oh, hold on.
[1963.70 → 1964.08] Hold on.
[1964.44 → 1968.28] When he enters into the keyboard, you plus me equals 69.
[1968.88 → 1969.56] Very nice.
[1970.26 → 1970.76] Good time.
[1970.78 → 1971.30] But it's subtle.
[1971.44 → 1972.14] It's very fast.
[1973.10 → 1975.02] Okay, hold on.
[1975.12 → 1975.78] You know, the mind...
[1975.78 → 1977.30] This guy's just like such a nerd.
[1977.44 → 1977.86] Look at this.
[1977.96 → 1978.92] Minecraft pickaxe.
[1978.98 → 1979.62] Planet's poster.
[1979.82 → 1980.54] Planet's poster.
[1980.82 → 1984.74] It's like some certificate of achievement from like Typing Tutor or something.
[1985.52 → 1986.66] It looks like that kind of thing.
[1987.18 → 1987.92] Then check this out.
[1988.80 → 1989.28] Oh, it's cute.
[1989.32 → 1989.70] Look at that.
[1989.74 → 1991.26] See, he's got a professional unboxed shirt.
[1991.36 → 1996.12] He actually ordered a professional unboxed shirt from, uh...
[1996.12 → 1996.50] What's it called?
[1996.56 → 1997.18] Café Press.
[1997.32 → 1997.48] Yeah.
[1997.48 → 2001.22] I don't get any money for them, but it still warms my heart to see people wearing them.
[2001.22 → 2008.72] I just enjoyed the overall nerdiness of this video.
[2008.82 → 2009.90] There's a Corsair mouse there.
[2010.04 → 2010.22] Yeah.
[2011.14 → 2013.58] It moves when he goes to this frame, but who cares?
[2013.70 → 2014.18] Yeah, it's okay.
[2014.46 → 2015.36] Continuity points.
[2015.56 → 2017.14] He gets a few docked, but...
[2017.14 → 2019.40] The nerdiness level is amazing.
[2019.64 → 2025.46] And for that style of a nerd to rage, that's just exactly what I envisioned them to do.
[2025.46 → 2025.96] It's just...
[2025.96 → 2031.48] Really, perfect.
[2031.78 → 2032.76] Yeah, I enjoyed that one.
[2033.64 → 2034.04] Okay.
[2035.28 → 2035.90] Here we go.
[2037.06 → 2037.92] You have HD on.
[2037.98 → 2039.02] Yeah, I'm leaving HD on.
[2039.02 → 2041.20] When you play HD, a lot of people lag.
[2041.46 → 2041.88] Oh, it's okay.
[2041.94 → 2042.56] You'll get over it.
[2043.42 → 2044.56] Um, okay.
[2045.18 → 2047.24] We'll go 720p HD, okay, guys?
[2047.68 → 2048.20] Full screen.
[2048.68 → 2049.20] This one...
[2049.20 → 2050.76] This one is friggin' awesome.
[2050.90 → 2051.00] Yeah.
[2051.10 → 2051.40] Here we go.
[2051.48 → 2052.30] And he killed me.
[2052.48 → 2053.52] Well, guess that happens.
[2056.20 → 2056.60] Outside.
[2057.32 → 2057.80] Now.
[2057.80 → 2057.94] Now.
[2057.94 → 2058.94] You.
[2067.12 → 2069.04] Linus, is that you?
[2069.16 → 2069.56] Juiced.
[2069.74 → 2070.94] Computer steroids.
[2071.32 → 2071.80] Of course.
[2072.00 → 2073.00] Why didn't I think of that?
[2073.14 → 2074.00] Oh, that's useful.
[2074.22 → 2074.50] Hey!
[2079.22 → 2081.72] Now you will know the meaning of...
[2081.72 → 2082.72] Oh.
[2083.44 → 2084.58] Shoot, I think we screwed up.
[2084.64 → 2087.20] I don't think we actually changed the view for them.
[2087.94 → 2089.16] Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
[2089.24 → 2090.20] I'm sure you're raging in the...
[2090.20 → 2091.10] Yeah, yeah, there you go.
[2091.14 → 2092.38] Okay, we have to try that one more time.
[2092.68 → 2094.20] I'm sorry, this one's worth seeing, guys.
[2094.36 → 2095.86] Here, let me figure out what scene that is.
[2095.90 → 2096.46] It's four.
[2096.70 → 2097.20] Yeah, there we go.
[2097.64 → 2098.16] Okay, full screen.
[2098.60 → 2099.26] Try that one more time.
[2099.30 → 2100.10] And he killed me.
[2100.28 → 2101.30] Well, guess that happens.
[2104.06 → 2104.42] Outside.
[2105.10 → 2105.62] Now.
[2114.36 → 2114.72] Juiced.
[2115.00 → 2116.82] Linus, is that you?
[2116.96 → 2117.36] Juiced.
[2117.36 → 2117.72] Juiced.
[2117.84 → 2118.68] Computer steroids.
[2119.08 → 2119.60] Of course.
[2119.82 → 2120.80] Why didn't I think of that?
[2120.92 → 2121.80] Oh, that's useful.
[2122.02 → 2122.28] Hey!
[2126.70 → 2129.58] Now you will know the meaning of...
[2129.58 → 2131.14] Angels.
[2132.58 → 2133.54] Ah, ah.
[2134.02 → 2134.94] Stupid autoplay.
[2135.18 → 2135.82] Not working properly.
[2136.42 → 2137.86] Okay, let's go back to our...
[2137.86 → 2138.14] Okay.
[2139.42 → 2140.24] So, uh...
[2140.24 → 2141.46] So that one we both...
[2141.46 → 2143.28] We both really, really enjoyed...
[2143.28 → 2144.60] ...and thought it was awesome.
[2145.00 → 2146.36] Just the, uh...
[2146.36 → 2148.00] It was just...
[2148.00 → 2149.30] Everything was just good.
[2149.64 → 2149.82] Yeah.
[2149.90 → 2151.62] The reason for him raging was perfect.
[2151.74 → 2152.04] Yeah.
[2152.04 → 2153.00] Because he's, like, a good guy.
[2153.22 → 2154.64] And the other guy was just...
[2154.64 → 2155.76] Such a douche.
[2155.88 → 2158.08] I don't know if you guys could read the message that the other guy...
[2158.08 → 2158.46] But it's like,
[2158.54 → 2160.30] OMG, if you knew Pony...
[2160.30 → 2160.42] Yeah.
[2160.50 → 2160.82] Whatever.
[2160.82 → 2166.08] And then grabbing the very specific audio bytes was just impressive.
[2166.30 → 2166.50] Yeah.
[2166.70 → 2167.58] Yeah, that was very good.
[2168.70 → 2169.28] Oh, okay.
[2169.34 → 2171.94] Apparently you guys really hate if I go full screen.
[2172.02 → 2172.48] Okay, fine.
[2172.86 → 2173.28] I'll stop.
[2174.44 → 2174.86] Uh...
[2174.86 → 2175.62] What can we do then?
[2175.66 → 2177.38] Can we make it a little bit bigger even?
[2177.82 → 2178.96] Maybe I can...
[2178.96 → 2179.14] Here.
[2179.56 → 2180.54] Let me remove that.
[2180.66 → 2182.40] I'm going to add a screen region.
[2182.40 → 2186.64] I'll just make it a little bit more specific so we can make it as big as we need to.
[2186.96 → 2187.54] There we go.
[2188.78 → 2189.12] Okay.
[2189.34 → 2191.78] Is it okay if I do this?
[2192.56 → 2194.28] I'm just going to make it bigger that way?
[2194.72 → 2195.76] Let's just check with them.
[2195.94 → 2197.08] Yeah, let's see what Twitch says.
[2197.46 → 2197.98] Is that okay?
[2199.26 → 2199.58] Okay.
[2199.96 → 2200.26] Yeah.
[2200.46 → 2200.70] Yeah.
[2200.92 → 2201.14] Yeah.
[2201.26 → 2201.52] Yeah.
[2201.72 → 2201.94] Yeah.
[2202.12 → 2202.44] Okay.
[2203.22 → 2203.52] Yeah.
[2203.70 → 2204.00] Okay.
[2205.68 → 2206.08] Okay.
[2206.32 → 2206.78] That's fine.
[2206.78 → 2208.40] So we'll go with that.
[2210.62 → 2211.42] We'll go with...
[2211.42 → 2211.56] Yeah.
[2211.68 → 2212.38] These two scenes.
[2212.64 → 2212.80] Okay.
[2213.90 → 2216.54] So here we go.
[2217.22 → 2218.02] Next winner.
[2218.46 → 2219.26] This one...
[2219.26 → 2220.86] Actually, I think this one was my favourite.
[2222.08 → 2222.60] So...
[2222.60 → 2223.44] Really, really, perfect.
[2223.68 → 2224.64] Yeah, this one's perfect.
[2228.30 → 2228.90] I know.
[2228.96 → 2230.86] These graphics are, like, just the best.
[2231.56 → 2233.76] Have you ever tried playing a game on a freaking PC?
[2235.30 → 2236.18] Console gamers.
[2236.48 → 2236.76] God.
[2236.78 → 2237.72] The graphics are horrible.
[2237.74 → 2238.48] Oh my God.
[2238.82 → 2239.68] Okay, that's it.
[2240.30 → 2241.10] Dude, what are you doing?
[2241.40 → 2241.96] Dude, stop.
[2242.06 → 2242.24] Stop.
[2242.32 → 2242.52] Dude.
[2242.92 → 2243.84] Dude, what is your problem?
[2244.96 → 2245.76] What are you doing?
[2253.44 → 2254.78] What am I supposed to do with this?
[2254.78 → 2255.78] Play real games.
[2261.78 → 2263.02] Oh my goodness.
[2263.16 → 2264.18] That was just so good.
[2264.30 → 2266.76] The sincerity of the play real games was epic.
[2266.78 → 2269.68] Play real games.
[2272.30 → 2273.56] I'm an Xbox gamer.
[2273.68 → 2275.04] What am I supposed to do with this thing?
[2275.16 → 2276.14] It's a mouse.
[2276.24 → 2277.18] I'm too confused.
[2277.18 → 2277.88] Oh my goodness.
[2277.88 → 2278.18] Oh my goodness.
[2278.18 → 2278.28] I'm so good.
[2278.28 → 2280.08] I'm so good.
[2280.08 → 2281.08] I'm so good.
[2281.08 → 2281.66] I'm so good.
[2281.66 → 2282.08] I'm so good.
[2282.08 → 2283.08] I'm so good.
[2283.08 → 2284.08] I'm so good.
[2284.08 → 2285.08] I'm so good.
[2285.08 → 2286.08] That was awesome.
[2286.08 → 2287.08] Love it.
[2287.08 → 2288.08] I'm pretty sure that was my favourite.
[2288.08 → 2288.64] It's amazing.
[2288.64 → 2289.20] Yeah.
[2289.20 → 2291.42] It's like just awesome.
[2291.80 → 2293.80] Here, check this out if you guys didn't see this.
[2294.38 → 2295.30] What am I supposed to do with this?
[2295.30 → 2297.34] See, look at the mic up here.
[2297.86 → 2298.56] It's awesome.
[2299.58 → 2300.08] Okay, okay.
[2300.12 → 2301.08] Punchline one more time.
[2301.08 → 2306.96] What am I supposed to do with this?
[2307.08 → 2308.48] Play real games.
[2310.00 → 2310.90] So good.
[2314.48 → 2315.54] Oh my goodness.
[2315.54 → 2316.26] Very awesome.
[2318.02 → 2318.40] Okay.
[2318.98 → 2319.80] Here we go.
[2320.42 → 2336.50] You're welcome.
[2336.50 → 2340.68] Now,
[2340.68 → 2345.46] You're welcome.
[2345.46 → 2354.84] I think that one was probably my personal favourite.
[2354.84 → 2357.40] That one was just done so well.
[2357.40 → 2360.58] The transitions were so good, the audio was so good.
[2360.58 → 2361.58] The audio was amazing.
[2361.58 → 2363.52] The style was probably the best.
[2363.52 → 2364.52] Oh yeah.
[2364.52 → 2366.52] Like out of everything we got, it was outstanding.
[2366.52 → 2368.98] That one was just straight up epic.
[2368.98 → 2372.46] And that was just, yeah, that was outstanding.
[2372.46 → 2373.46] Yeah.
[2373.46 → 2374.46] Yeah.
[2374.46 → 2377.60] Like how many times have you had that happen where you just want to, you need to do something
[2377.60 → 2379.80] on your computer and Adobe's like, oh, I need to do it.
[2379.80 → 2382.60] Door, door, door, door.
[2382.60 → 2383.60] Screw you Adobe.
[2383.60 → 2384.60] Yeah.
[2384.60 → 2385.60] That one was outstanding.
[2385.60 → 2386.60] Yeah.
[2386.60 → 2387.60] So good.
[2387.60 → 2388.60] Okay.
[2388.60 → 2389.60] Here we go guys.
[2389.60 → 2390.60] Last winner.
[2390.60 → 2394.98] And this one you guys probably aren't going to like as much as some of the other ones.
[2394.98 → 2396.98] But I think it's pretty funny.
[2396.98 → 2397.98] Gotcha!
[2397.98 → 2400.12] God, stop!
[2400.12 → 2403.32] I need to triple A batteries.
[2403.32 → 2406.32] My keyboard died, and I just want to finish my game.
[2406.32 → 2407.12] I got an idea.
[2407.12 → 2408.26] The best idea.
[2408.26 → 2422.26] Thanks dad, this will work perfect.
[2422.26 → 2423.40] Tell him about the blooper.
[2423.40 → 2424.40] Tell him about the blooper.
[2424.40 → 2425.40] Tell him about the blooper.
[2425.40 → 2426.40] Okay.
[2426.40 → 2427.40] Okay.
[2427.40 → 2428.40] So like, hold on, hold on.
[2428.40 → 2429.40] Let's go back for a second.
[2429.40 → 2430.40] Okay.
[2430.40 → 2431.40] So it's like, yeah.
[2431.40 → 2432.40] Thanks dad.
[2432.40 → 2433.40] Thanks Paul.
[2433.40 → 2434.40] Great.
[2434.40 → 2435.40] Love it.
[2435.40 → 2436.40] I love it so much.
[2436.40 → 2453.48] And there's a making of video on Redneck Rackham's channel, and he's like, he shows the injury
[2453.48 → 2456.40] to his son from filming that.
[2456.40 → 2457.40] It's awesome.
[2457.40 → 2458.40] So good.
[2458.40 → 2461.40] You can see him get hit, and then he goes like, ah, at the end of the video.
[2461.40 → 2462.40] Oh, I know.
[2462.40 → 2463.40] Oh, I know.
[2463.40 → 2464.40] Absolutely.
[2464.40 → 2465.40] Okay, hold on, hold on.
[2465.40 → 2466.40] This is important.
[2466.40 → 2467.40] One of the best parts.
[2467.40 → 2468.40] Yeah, so check this out.
[2468.40 → 2472.40] So when he's looking for the batteries, let's have a look at where he tries to get them from.
[2472.40 → 2475.40] Okay, so he's going through the drawers looking for electrons.
[2475.40 → 2476.40] Okay.
[2476.40 → 2477.40] What did he find?
[2477.40 → 2478.40] What was that?
[2478.40 → 2480.40] That he tries to take batteries out.
[2480.40 → 2481.40] Is that...
[2481.40 → 2482.40] Because he's reluctant.
[2482.40 → 2483.40] He's very reluctant.
[2483.40 → 2484.40] Yeah, he doesn't want to touch that.
[2484.40 → 2485.40] What is that?
[2485.40 → 2487.40] Oh, oh, oh, that doesn't look good.
[2487.40 → 2488.40] And you can tell like, okay, go back for a second.
[2488.40 → 2489.40] Yeah.
[2489.40 → 2490.40] Oh, I didn't go back for a second.
[2490.40 → 2499.40] You can tell very obviously like the guy's side of the room and then heart, like you
[2499.40 → 2501.40] can tell it's the lady's side of the room.
[2501.40 → 2503.40] Yeah, I think we all know what that is.
[2503.40 → 2504.40] There's a control pillow right there.
[2504.40 → 2505.40] It's awesome.
[2505.40 → 2506.40] Like the redneck ness is unprecedented.
[2506.40 → 2508.40] You were dying, and I just want to finish my game.
[2508.40 → 2509.40] I got an idea.
[2509.40 → 2510.40] Oh, yeah, you do.
[2510.40 → 2511.40] There's a new car battery.
[2511.40 → 2512.40] Oh, thanks dad.
[2512.40 → 2513.40] This will work perfect.
[2513.40 → 2514.40] You can look at you like, it goes where it goes.
[2514.40 → 2526.40] I think my favourite part is that they just embraced the whole idea so much.
[2526.40 → 2527.40] I know.
[2527.40 → 2528.40] It just went for gold.
[2528.40 → 2529.40] That was perfect.
[2529.40 → 2530.40] It was great.
[2530.40 → 2534.40] So, I think that's pretty much it guys.
[2534.40 → 2537.40] Thanks for checking out this video on the winner announcements.
[2537.40 → 2540.40] And yeah, no, it's not a flashlight.
[2540.40 → 2541.40] It is a dildo.
[2541.40 → 2544.40] So, here we go guys.
[2544.40 → 2546.40] We ended up picking seven winners.
[2546.40 → 2555.40] So, all seven of those winners get a K90 keyboard and a copy of Assassin's Creed 3.
[2555.40 → 2560.40] All the runner-ups get a copy of Assassin's Creed 3.
[2560.40 → 2563.40] So, thank you guys all for participating.
[2563.40 → 2567.40] I was overwhelmed again by how many awesome submissions I got.
[2567.40 → 2570.40] I mean, it's the same thing I've run into before where I'm just...
[2570.40 → 2575.40] I mean, this time I wanted to make sure that I had at least five prizes to give away.
[2575.40 → 2585.40] Because in the past when I've had one prize to give away, it's just been devastating to have to narrow it down to just one person.
[2585.40 → 2586.40] Because there's so many.
[2586.40 → 2589.40] Narrowing it down to one would have been ridiculous.
[2589.40 → 2590.40] Yes.
[2590.40 → 2592.40] Even narrowing it down to what we did was ridiculous.
[2592.40 → 2593.40] It was really hard.
[2593.40 → 2596.40] And I especially felt bad for...
[2596.40 → 2597.40] What's his name?
[2597.40 → 2598.40] The guy that made the last one?
[2598.40 → 2599.40] Oh, Large Hard Productions.
[2599.40 → 2600.40] Yeah.
[2600.40 → 2601.40] I know.
[2601.40 → 2603.40] Because he's a runner-up now like twice in a row.
[2603.40 → 2604.40] Yeah.
[2604.40 → 2605.40] But it's...
[2605.40 → 2606.40] Yeah, I love his videos.
[2606.40 → 2607.40] It's just...
[2607.40 → 2610.40] It's hard because we have to pick winners somehow.
[2610.40 → 2613.40] And, yeah, I know we had a lot of fun judging them.
[2613.40 → 2619.40] I think we probably laughed more in the last few hours here than any other time.
[2619.40 → 2622.40] So, thank you guys.
[2622.40 → 2625.40] And, hey, we'll have more contests coming up.
[2625.40 → 2628.40] Hopefully I can get some cool prizes for you guys.
[2628.40 → 2631.40] I hope you guys understand why I do this the way I do.
[2631.40 → 2633.40] I don't do like comment on the video to win.
[2633.40 → 2634.40] I want to...
[2634.40 → 2635.40] I want to see...
[2635.40 → 2639.40] I mean, honestly the ones that made me the happiest are the ones where people post under the video, and they say,
[2639.40 → 2641.40] This is my first YouTube video.
[2641.40 → 2644.40] Or, like, this is my first time doing this type of video.
[2644.40 → 2645.40] Or whatever else.
[2645.40 → 2646.40] I want you guys to try things.
[2646.40 → 2647.40] I want you guys to have fun.
[2647.40 → 2648.40] And, uh...
[2648.40 → 2654.40] I will post this video to YouTube with a summary under the video of all the winning videos and all the runner-up videos.
[2654.40 → 2655.40] So...
[2655.40 → 2656.40] Yeah, we should link your playlist.
[2656.40 → 2657.40] I think you can send out...
[2657.40 → 2658.40] Oh, yeah.
[2658.40 → 2659.40] We'll just show the...
[2659.40 → 2660.40] We'll throw the playlists in there.
[2660.40 → 2662.40] So you can see the winner playlist and the...
[2662.40 → 2663.40] And the, uh...
[2663.40 → 2665.40] Honourable Mentions playlist.
[2665.40 → 2666.40] Yeah.
[2666.40 → 2667.40] Thanks guys.
[2667.40 → 2668.40] And goodnight everyone.
[2668.40 → 2669.40] Goodnight guys.
