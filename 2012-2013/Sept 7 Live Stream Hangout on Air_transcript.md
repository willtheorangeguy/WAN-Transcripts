[0.00 --> 14.60]  Okay, so in theory we're live, and wow, that's broken.
[15.36 --> 18.50]  So, fascinating.
[18.80 --> 22.00]  Hopefully my microphone is working, although I don't know which one.
[22.26 --> 23.38]  Oh, good, it's this one.
[23.38 --> 30.74]  So I'll probably wait to get started until we'll actually join the live segment here.
[31.24 --> 34.64]  Let's just get the broadcaster going.
[35.02 --> 39.38]  Let's get the hangout going over here.
[39.54 --> 42.44]  Actually, what I should really do is I should load up the YouTube channel.
[43.48 --> 45.74]  And I've got a bunch of tweets coming in already.
[46.64 --> 48.70]  Hello there, Linus. Can I have a shout-out?
[48.70 --> 51.06]  asks DK Nyan. He's from Malaysia.
[51.66 --> 52.14]  Sweet.
[53.38 --> 54.62]  Malaysia is cool.
[55.44 --> 57.80]  I have family in Malaysia, sort of, apparently.
[58.64 --> 62.58]  I have in-law family in Malaysia.
[63.18 --> 64.94]  So that sort of counts, right?
[65.70 --> 68.26]  I'm going to move this over, and I'm going to move.
[68.44 --> 71.68]  So guys, I'm using a new video broadcasting system tonight.
[71.74 --> 73.18]  I was just using my webcam before.
[73.18 --> 80.22]  Actually, here, let me center my webcam so that this doesn't drive me crazy for the rest of the broadcast here.
[80.22 --> 84.52]  So I'm using XSplit, which is sort of neat because I can do this.
[85.06 --> 89.50]  And now you guys can actually see the Twitter feed as things come in.
[89.84 --> 91.98]  So I think that's pretty cool.
[92.16 --> 93.80]  I got myself a license for this.
[93.86 --> 95.00]  It's actually not that expensive.
[95.00 --> 97.92]  So I can just press a hotkey, and then I can switch between...
[97.92 --> 98.56]  Actually, here, here.
[98.64 --> 99.06]  Check this out.
[99.12 --> 99.52]  Check this out.
[99.60 --> 103.26]  So this is the webcam built into my notebook.
[103.26 --> 108.46]  So you can see that it's pretty clear which one we'd rather be using at this point.
[108.60 --> 111.44]  I can do, like, little transitions, and you guys can see the Twitter feed.
[112.18 --> 113.18]  What mic am I using?
[113.26 --> 115.16]  I'm using the mic built into my headset here.
[115.20 --> 116.12]  Is there a problem with it?
[116.56 --> 121.90]  You guys should let me know right away so that I can potentially fix that if there's any kind of an issue.
[122.44 --> 123.66]  And Amir's in California.
[123.80 --> 125.06]  He wants to know if he gets a shout-out.
[125.78 --> 127.08]  The answer is no, Amir.
[127.14 --> 127.68]  You do not.
[128.40 --> 129.48]  It's bad quality.
[129.56 --> 130.50]  We can't see the writing.
[130.50 --> 133.04]  You know what, there's nothing I can do about that for now.
[134.18 --> 136.28]  You'll just have to kind of take my...
[136.28 --> 139.40]  Actually, you know what, I could probably change it.
[140.30 --> 140.64]  Here.
[140.86 --> 143.64]  Let's see if we can fix this up a little bit here.
[144.20 --> 146.10]  So let's take this one out.
[146.74 --> 149.44]  Let's add a new screen region.
[150.60 --> 153.96]  Let's make it just the top tweets, maybe.
[156.22 --> 159.88]  And let's see if this is easier for you guys to read.
[159.88 --> 160.60]  Actually, no.
[160.70 --> 166.40]  Before we do that, we should maybe take the browser and control plus plus a little bit.
[166.62 --> 168.00]  I'm sorry the quality is so bad.
[168.36 --> 172.38]  In future, what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be switching over to...
[172.38 --> 174.16]  What's it called again?
[175.04 --> 175.68]  That thing.
[175.82 --> 176.30]  Twitch TV.
[176.58 --> 179.24]  So I'm going to be using Twitch TV instead of Google Hangouts on Air.
[179.24 --> 185.38]  It sounds like there's a lot of advantages, including that I will be able to...
[185.38 --> 186.06]  Sorry, guys.
[186.08 --> 188.64]  I'm just sort of trying to do this right now.
[188.84 --> 191.20]  And then we will sort of know what's going on here.
[197.56 --> 198.22]  There we go.
[198.28 --> 199.90]  Let's try moving that around.
[200.34 --> 204.02]  So I'm going to switch to Twitch TV, which will allow me to broadcast in HD.
[204.02 --> 207.84]  Let me know if that's easier to read or if it's just still terrible.
[213.84 --> 216.00]  I believe I've increased the font size again.
[216.38 --> 218.98]  Sorry, I'm not really getting started with any Q&A yet here.
[219.90 --> 221.66]  Just working on technical difficulties.
[222.08 --> 224.06]  This is going to be happening for a while, you guys.
[224.16 --> 225.78]  There's really nothing I can do about it.
[225.78 --> 230.06]  We're going to be making a lot of changes over the next little while.
[230.10 --> 232.78]  I'm really hoping Slick's going to join us for the live stream today.
[232.86 --> 233.96]  He's actually...
[233.96 --> 238.78]  We've got a filming session tomorrow, and he's coming over to...
[239.64 --> 243.64]  Because he doesn't have a car, because he's some kind of homeless person.
[244.62 --> 247.56]  And so we're driving in tomorrow together.
[247.68 --> 251.72]  He wasn't able to make it today, so we have to film on a Saturday, which sort of sucks.
[251.72 --> 254.46]  But then it's a break.
[254.54 --> 263.64]  Someone's got to make videos about GTX, non-disclosure, whatever might be coming out at some point or might not.
[263.94 --> 266.42]  And I guess that person's got to be me.
[267.40 --> 269.12]  Okay, let's see if this works this time.
[269.18 --> 272.94]  I've increased the font size as big as I can realistically get.
[273.26 --> 277.34]  And let's see if that works for you guys here.
[278.12 --> 278.80]  We good now?
[278.80 --> 281.96]  Okay, I'm getting tweets that say, that's a bit better, Linus.
[282.16 --> 284.90]  Let's go ahead and refresh those tweets and see if this works.
[285.00 --> 289.52]  I'm, like, super excited about this whole XSplit broadcaster thing.
[289.60 --> 289.82]  Ha!
[289.86 --> 290.50]  That works!
[290.92 --> 291.32]  Yes!
[291.90 --> 292.86]  All right, we have success.
[293.76 --> 297.96]  So I'm going to switch back to my Google Hangout really quick there, so I can actually see how many people are tuned in.
[298.00 --> 299.58]  So why don't we start doing a little bit of Q&A?
[299.58 --> 303.60]  Okay, and I will go back to the Connect tab here.
[304.48 --> 308.88]  You guys can sort of check that out with me, assuming that it'll ever actually load.
[308.96 --> 309.36]  There we go.
[309.74 --> 314.80]  Oh, and now it's in the wrong spot, which just freaking figures.
[314.94 --> 316.46]  Here, let's see if we can play around with this.
[317.04 --> 317.86]  Looks amazing.
[318.04 --> 319.60]  Joseph, you look amazing.
[319.60 --> 323.08]  So that is all there is to say about it.
[325.56 --> 326.76]  All right, here we go.
[328.56 --> 330.60]  CWGO wants to know...
[330.60 --> 337.36]  There we go.
[337.88 --> 341.62]  CWGO wants to know what is the best upgrade for a laptop besides an SSD.
[341.62 --> 343.82]  Well, CW, great question.
[343.94 --> 346.04]  The best upgrade for a laptop is an SSD.
[346.98 --> 349.74]  There isn't really a whole lot else you can do to upgrade a laptop.
[349.96 --> 354.72]  I mean, some notebooks do use MXM modules, so you have potentially upgradable graphics,
[354.96 --> 357.48]  but we're not going to see any kind of widespread adoption of that.
[357.78 --> 362.28]  What I'm really excited about is external Thunderbolt graphics cards.
[362.68 --> 368.92]  Then we will be able to truly talk about, you know, notebooks like this, this HP right here,
[368.92 --> 372.86]  that are completely business class, totally useless for gaming.
[373.16 --> 377.68]  If they come equipped with Thunderbolt, all of a sudden we're going to be able to just plug in an external Thunderbolt thing
[377.68 --> 382.92]  when we get to our actual desktop, you know, in your dorm or in your room or in your house or whatever else the case may be.
[383.48 --> 389.00]  And you'll be able to run games almost as well as a desktop because those notebook processors,
[389.52 --> 395.06]  some of the dual cores especially, are using the same architecture with the same memory bandwidth that the desktop ones are.
[395.06 --> 397.78]  And if you've got a dual core, they're going to be clocked quite high,
[397.78 --> 401.98]  which for any game other than a select few is way more than enough anyway.
[402.12 --> 403.52]  So I'm really excited about that.
[403.64 --> 405.50]  But right now we don't have many options.
[405.58 --> 408.42]  You can upgrade your RAM, but RAM is so cheap these days.
[408.50 --> 411.66]  You've got notebooks coming with 8 or 16 gigs of RAM right out of the box.
[411.76 --> 414.38]  So what else can you really do?
[416.12 --> 421.22]  Okay, let's see if there's any other questions we got right at the beginning here that I can potentially answer.
[421.34 --> 422.66]  Okay, Hugh. Hugh has a question.
[422.66 --> 429.78]  So 120 mil plus 240 millimeter rad combo versus a single 360 for cooling an i7-920.
[430.00 --> 437.90]  Okay, number one is that just to cool a CPU, either of those solutions are totally overkill unless you want to use very quiet fans.
[438.00 --> 439.78]  Now personally, I'm a big fan of quiet cooling.
[439.78 --> 445.04]  So to cool a single CPU and a single GPU, I'm using a dual and a triple.
[445.44 --> 447.50]  And then I'm running at very, very low fan speeds.
[448.98 --> 457.42]  I would personally go for the single 360 just for the lower pressure drop because the more bends you do in your water cooling loop,
[457.68 --> 460.70]  the more the pressure is going to drop, the more your flow rate is going to reduce.
[460.78 --> 462.52]  It doesn't make that big of a difference to performance.
[462.52 --> 468.24]  But if you want to be getting the best of the best out of your system, then go for the single 360.
[468.84 --> 475.14]  And then if you really want to get the best of the best, add more radiators anyway because more radiators is always better.
[476.48 --> 479.78]  Tenassus says it's still unreadable, but some people are saying that they can read it.
[479.84 --> 481.00]  So that's all I can really do.
[481.10 --> 481.24]  Okay.
[481.98 --> 484.22]  And I just accidentally did that.
[484.32 --> 485.98]  So let's go ahead and widen that again.
[486.46 --> 487.54]  52 new interactions.
[487.54 --> 488.86]  Let's have a look at some of these tweets.
[488.96 --> 493.76]  So guys, don't be upset if I can't answer every tweet on the live hangout here.
[493.98 --> 499.52]  I'm sorry, but there's so many that it's pretty hard for me to get to them all.
[500.72 --> 501.58]  Let's start.
[503.06 --> 504.14]  More live Q&A.
[504.22 --> 504.54]  Love them.
[504.64 --> 505.04]  Thank you.
[505.66 --> 506.10]  Raina?
[506.84 --> 508.58]  I'm going to try and do that.
[508.68 --> 511.44]  Actually, I'm going to try and have a regularly scheduled time every week.
[511.58 --> 516.92]  So it would be great if you guys gave me some feedback in terms of what you think would be a good regularly scheduled time
[516.92 --> 519.66]  because I think that would really help people know when to tune in.
[519.74 --> 524.68]  I've got a lot of complaints that people didn't know that I was doing a live stream
[524.68 --> 528.34]  and they would have loved to have tuned in, but they weren't able to because they didn't know about it.
[528.76 --> 530.82]  So I do announce them on Twitter.
[530.96 --> 536.56]  I do announce them on YouTube, but not everybody is glued to their phone like this, like me.
[537.00 --> 542.04]  So yeah, if we have a regularly scheduled segment, then I think it'll be much easier.
[543.78 --> 544.62]  BJ wants to know,
[544.62 --> 548.90]  Hey Linus, I've asked a few times already, but do you know if the 7970 is better than the 7970?
[562.90 --> 563.38]  Okay.
[574.62 --> 575.62]  Thank you.
[604.62 --> 605.62]  Thank you.
[634.62 --> 635.62]  Thank you.
[664.62 --> 665.62]  Thank you.
[694.62 --> 695.62]  Thank you.
[724.62 --> 725.62]  Thank you.
[754.62 --> 755.62]  Thank you.
[784.62 --> 785.62]  Thank you.
[814.62 --> 815.62]  Thank you.
[844.62 --> 845.62]  Thank you.
[845.62 --> 846.08]  Thanks.
[846.56 --> 849.62]  Thanks.
[849.80 --> 862.62]  Have a great day.
[862.62 --> 863.90]  Thank you.
[864.62 --> 867.20]  Thank you.
[869.94 --> 871.62]  Bye.
[871.62 --> 872.62]  Bye.
