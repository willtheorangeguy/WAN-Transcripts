[0.00 --> 6.84]  Are we starting? We're starting. Welcome to the live stream everyone. We have a special guest
[6.84 --> 12.12]  tonight. This is Josh from Fractal Design. Josh, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself
[12.12 --> 16.62]  that they can't tell just from looking at you, like the fact that you're some kind of gigantic
[16.62 --> 21.78]  monster person. The fact that I'm incredibly awesome. I mean, I think that's a given. So yeah,
[21.78 --> 28.08]  I am the VP of Marketing for North America for Fractal Design and I guess prior to that I was a
[28.08 --> 32.70]  boutique system builder. So I know a few things about computer cases and stuff like that, but
[32.70 --> 39.70]  it's all up in the air. I bored you off already, huh? No, no, it's my notebook no longer has a picture
[39.70 --> 45.30]  on the screen. So maybe you could actually help me with some diagnostic diagnostic testing procedures.
[45.30 --> 51.14]  Let's plug it in. Well, it's clearly plugged in. It is plugged into the wall. Okay. Let's see if Josh
[51.14 --> 55.80]  can handle this because this will determine whether he's actually worthy to appear on the Linus Tech
[55.80 --> 59.58]  Tips live stream. Although he's here already anyway. Yeah, exactly. It was a long, long drive.
[59.58 --> 66.90]  Okay. What do you got? What do you got? Okay. It looks like it's off. Okay. Let's try pressing the
[66.90 --> 71.98]  button. Okay. Power button. I'm pressing the power button. We are getting, we are getting a battery
[71.98 --> 77.04]  indicator here. Battery indicator. What do you got next? It means you have a battery. It means I have a
[77.04 --> 80.20]  battery. Okay. You know what? I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna give him the answer
[80.20 --> 85.18]  because I need to get my notebook up and running. It has an extended battery pack and the battery pack
[85.18 --> 90.16]  charges before it actually passes through to the notebook. So I have to plug the notebook in
[90.16 --> 95.38]  directly. I'm just gonna take my stupid battery pack off so that I can actually have my notebook.
[95.38 --> 100.78]  So, so Josh, the, the boutique system builder that you, I mean, you, you were like an assembly guy
[100.78 --> 107.98]  there or something, right? Yeah. I was a janitor. I've been a janitor quite a few places actually. Yeah. So the name of the
[107.98 --> 112.48]  company was biohazard computer systems. We just did mainly like really high end PC. Hold on,
[112.48 --> 116.80]  before we go any further, I want to take, I want to take some, I want to take some Twitter feedback
[116.80 --> 122.14]  here and I want to turn this keyboard on first so that it actually works and like does things.
[122.14 --> 133.24]  Need help with that too? Slick, we got, we got trouble here. Is this plugged in? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe not.
[133.24 --> 141.74]  Okay, cool. So let's go to Twitter guys. There we go. Six new interactions. You who have heard of
[141.74 --> 148.18]  biohazard. Oh jeez. It's been a while, man. Come on. I would like you to tune in and let us know,
[148.18 --> 154.06]  let us know your thoughts about, about biohazard computers. Remember you got 140 characters. Tweet
[154.06 --> 159.46]  at Linus Tech on Twitter. My, my Twitter sort of tag thing isn't here but I suspect most of you are
[159.46 --> 165.40]  probably following already anyway. It would make Josh feel a lot better. What, that your fans can
[165.40 --> 172.22]  use Google really quick? Okay guys, we want people who have legitimately heard of biohazard before.
[172.22 --> 175.72]  That's what, that's what we're especially looking for here. That's what you're looking for. That's
[175.72 --> 181.06]  what, yeah, I'm just stalling for time while I figure out what this company did. Talk amongst yourselves,
[181.06 --> 190.72]  we'll give you a topic, biohazard go. Ah yes, there we go. Talk about the 900D tonight please. That's the first tweet.
[190.72 --> 199.00]  Yes. There we go. Okay. Are you allowed to talk about competitors cases on the live stream? Because we had a list of things that we weren't allowed to talk about.
[199.00 --> 203.00]  Bunnies. Sorry, what? Bunnies. Bunnies. Can't talk about bunnies. Can't talk about bunnies.
[203.00 --> 212.56]  Especially brown ones. Yeah, unicorns are okay. Unicorns are okay. Of course, our competitors cases. Are you allowed to talk about them? Sure. Sure. Okay. Okay.
[212.56 --> 219.76]  So, he wants us to talk about the 900D. Have you seen the 900D? Have you seen my video about the 900D? The case, yes. Your video, no.
[219.76 --> 230.60]  Ouch. What do you think? As, as, put on your ex boutique system builder hat rather than your fractal design hat. What do you think?
[230.60 --> 248.60]  Now, I said I could talk about it. Of course, I'm going to be very politically correct. It's a case that's made out of metal. And, no, it's a sizable case. I think that they, you know, the biggest thing is, people seem to think that a lot of people in the industry don't like each other because somebody's a competitor.
[248.60 --> 258.60]  But I think you have to have some mutual respect there. You know, it's like, they do what they do. They've gotten to the size that they've gotten to because of the fact they've been able to make good products. So, there's respect.
[258.60 --> 268.60]  Wow. You actually didn't talk about the 900D. I know. Did you see how I just like went all the way around it? Yeah, but see, I was, I was, I was, I could. You didn't ask me if I would.
[268.60 --> 281.60]  Dolphins versus unicorns. I, you know, I think dolphins are an obvious choice because unlike unicorns, dolphins will actually heal any ailments of the body without harvesting the horn.
[281.60 --> 291.60]  They cannot shoot rainbows. No, dolphins cannot shoot rainbows. But everyone knows that dolphins, much like a Nyan cat, can actually trail a rainbow behind them when they swim. You just can't see it because they're in the water.
[291.60 --> 297.60]  Yeah, but you know, unicorns like Highlander. There's only one. If you've played Red Alert 2, you can also strap lasers to the head of dolphins.
[297.60 --> 305.60]  That's true. That's true. I mean, if you, I mean the, the unicorn, by the time the unicorn actually gets to you and impales you in the chest.
[305.60 --> 309.60]  It doesn't have to touch you. It can shoot the rainbow. That's what I'm saying.
[309.60 --> 312.60]  Yeah. Cause what's a rainbow going to do? Like change your sexual orientation?
[312.60 --> 314.60]  You ever watch Freddie W?
[314.60 --> 315.60]  Uh, okay. Yes.
[315.60 --> 316.60]  Okay. So, okay.
[316.60 --> 317.60]  Okay.
[317.60 --> 323.60]  Okay. All right. So moving on to the next day, Slick and you are too casual. Go put on a coat.
[323.60 --> 327.60]  Yeah. Yeah. No, it's not, it's not a dress up thing. It's a temperature thing.
[327.60 --> 333.60]  Yeah. It's actually pretty chilly in here. I'm wearing like snow boots cause it's freezing in here.
[333.60 --> 336.60]  It's like the, it's like the tundra, the great white North up here.
[336.60 --> 340.60]  All right. So question you, have you been, have you been keeping up with the video card tech?
[340.60 --> 344.60]  Cause I'd love to have you answer some of the questions since you used to know something about like computers.
[344.60 --> 351.60]  I used to, I used to, I shifted my focus. So yes, to a certain degree, but you're just going to correct me and make me look like an idiot anyway.
[351.60 --> 356.60]  So. Okay. So should I get a 660 Ti or wait till the 670s price drops or the 700 series comes out?
[356.60 --> 361.60]  Personally, if you can afford a 670, go for it. If not, grab the 660 Ti, be happy with it.
[361.60 --> 371.60]  I don't think anyone knows when 700 series is coming out. So, and if we did know, then we'd probably talk about the mutual respect that we have for competitors.
[371.60 --> 373.60]  Exactly. I'm just saying, but that's legit though.
[373.60 --> 374.60]  Just deflect.
[374.60 --> 376.60]  Yeah. Deflect, deflect. It's all centrifuge.
[376.60 --> 378.60]  Correction. What's biohazard?
[378.60 --> 379.60]  Hmm.
[379.60 --> 380.60]  Hmm.
[380.60 --> 381.60]  I don't know.
[381.60 --> 383.60]  Biohazard. You forgot.
[383.60 --> 384.60]  Biohazard. You forgot.
[384.60 --> 385.60]  Biohazard. We had everything.
[385.60 --> 388.60]  Yeah. What's, what's biohazard? Oh no.
[388.60 --> 390.60]  It's like word association now.
[390.60 --> 394.60]  Oh, okay. This is good. Biohazard's dead. He thought you were still in business.
[394.60 --> 396.60]  Uh, I'm not.
[396.60 --> 398.60]  Is biohazard still around?
[398.60 --> 399.60]  No, shouldn't be.
[399.60 --> 400.60]  Oh.
[400.60 --> 403.60]  I don't know. Maybe now I need to go Google something myself. It's like I need to sue somebody.
[403.60 --> 404.60]  Oh, fascinating.
[404.60 --> 406.60]  So I might be retiring fairly early.
[406.60 --> 410.60]  Okay. Just to let you know, there's a bit of a latency for them actually seeing the live stream.
[410.60 --> 417.60]  So these next new 17 interactions could actually, okay. Something about me wearing the same pants all the time.
[417.60 --> 424.60]  Linus, change your pants. Okay. Here's, here's a question. Why didn't fractal include sound deadening in the new Arc MIDI R2?
[424.60 --> 431.60]  Well, the reason we didn't do that is that the Define series is our silent, our quiet PC case line.
[431.60 --> 434.60]  Yes. If I could put a panel up right here, this would go a lot better.
[434.60 --> 437.60]  But, uh, you know, Arc is all about airflow.
[437.60 --> 440.60]  So basically if you want high airflow case, you go with the Arc.
[440.60 --> 444.60]  If you want airflow plus sound deadening, you go with the Define series.
[444.60 --> 446.60]  Okay. Well, that was pretty straightforward.
[446.60 --> 447.60]  I think that pretty much took care of it.
[447.60 --> 452.60]  Uh, should I get a 79 70? Oh wow. A GTX 70. Okay. He's just trolling.
[452.60 --> 457.60]  Okay. How is slick wearing shorts and short sleeves? I don't know. He's some kind of.
[457.60 --> 459.60]  Need a coat. I got one.
[459.60 --> 464.60]  I have never heard of robot dolphin attack. Thus unicorns. There will never be glitter.
[464.60 --> 473.60]  Props to the fractal guy. Look at all professional. Well, you know, it's funny because he was asking if he was overdressed to which I didn't really listen.
[473.60 --> 479.60]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought this was going to be professional. My bad. No.
[479.60 --> 486.60]  What would you say to a friend who says power supplies are a lie and all the power goes raw to your components?
[486.60 --> 488.60]  Slick, why don't you handle that one?
[488.60 --> 497.60]  I, uh, maybe just don't be friends with him anymore. Maybe that has to, like, you have to draw a line somewhere.
[497.60 --> 509.60]  And maybe it has to be a logical one. Like, it's one thing if he plays Black Ops night and day on a PS3 and, you know, has, like, the special PlayStation 3 monitor that is somehow special from the other monitors.
[509.60 --> 515.60]  And then it's another thing if you, if he thinks you want to plug, like, individual cables to each one of your components from the wall. That's just.
[515.60 --> 516.60]  You could do that once.
[516.60 --> 519.60]  I've actually met people like that.
[519.60 --> 525.60]  Who think that power bars are, like, bad and you have to plug each component separately to the wall?
[525.60 --> 530.60]  Although I think my personal favorite, this was, uh, hopefully my mother-in-law isn't watching.
[530.60 --> 534.60]  Because one of my favorites was, you know, that little LED light on power bars?
[534.60 --> 535.60]  Yeah.
[535.60 --> 536.60]  Yeah.
[536.60 --> 547.60]  Yeah. Um, she would insist on not only turning off all of the electronics, but also switching off the power bar to preserve the light, the electricity that was being consumed powering the light.
[547.60 --> 549.60]  High wattage LED that's on there.
[549.60 --> 555.60]  And, and, and it's not even just like, okay, and I know some devices, like, they'll, they'll draw power at idle.
[555.60 --> 556.60]  Hmm.
[556.60 --> 563.60]  We know this. And so everything would be unplugged from the power bar. It still needed to be turned off to conserve the power.
[563.60 --> 569.60]  When I was in college, actually my business partner at the time, you know, typical geek setup, LEDs flashing everywhere up, all kinds of devices.
[569.60 --> 573.60]  And then on the smoke alarm on the ceiling, he had a piece of black tape over the one LED.
[573.60 --> 580.60]  I'm like, it looks like the New York city skyline over there. You can sleep with that. But that one LED smoke alarm is killing you for some reason.
[580.60 --> 589.60]  Oh nerds. How we are so like you. And yet we make fun of you. Gigabit Ethernet. How much would you pay for a month?
[589.60 --> 595.60]  This is actually a good question. How much would you pay per month for gigabit, gigabit up, down like Google, whatever it's called. Google fiber fiber.
[595.60 --> 596.60]  Google fiber.
[596.60 --> 597.60]  Google fiber.
[597.60 --> 598.60]  $11.
[598.60 --> 601.60]  $11. Perfect. Thank you. How much would you pay?
[601.60 --> 606.60]  Were you going to say the exact, you guys are, are you guys like a bunch of Tolkien fans around here?
[606.60 --> 608.60]  We're just awesome by nature.
[608.60 --> 609.60]  He does that, doesn't he?
[609.60 --> 610.60]  11T?
[610.60 --> 612.60]  Yeah. He's a, whatever. The Hobbit is 11T something.
[612.60 --> 614.60]  11T or 11T?
[614.60 --> 615.60]  Well, it's kind of similar.
[615.60 --> 620.60]  It's 111 something. I don't remember what it is, but it's a hundred and something.
[620.60 --> 621.60]  11T something.
[621.60 --> 622.60]  Yeah. Yeah.
[622.60 --> 624.60]  Okay. Well, whatever. How much would you pay for Google fiber?
[624.60 --> 625.60]  11T dollars.
[625.60 --> 626.60]  11T.
[626.60 --> 630.60]  Okay. Well, I'm going to actually give a useful answer.
[630.60 --> 634.60]  Probably I wouldn't pay that much more than the internet plans that are available now.
[634.60 --> 641.60]  So in my area, you can get 250 down 15 up for around 120 bucks a month.
[641.60 --> 650.60]  So I'd say if I was going to get that kind of an up speed, I would probably pay 200 to 250, but I wouldn't want it to start creeping up into the same class as business tier.
[650.60 --> 651.60]  Internet service plans.
[651.60 --> 656.60]  I would like it to be available so that hopefully it would be cheaper, but I wouldn't pay that much.
[656.60 --> 659.60]  You wouldn't pay? How much? Okay, then why don't you give a real answer?
[659.60 --> 661.60]  I don't know, but not 250 dollars a month.
[661.60 --> 662.60]  Okay.
[662.60 --> 665.60]  That's like enough insurance to put a car on the road.
[665.60 --> 666.60]  That's true.
[666.60 --> 669.60]  Where can we go to watch your live stream? Good question.
[669.60 --> 673.60]  If you're not watching it, then you're not going to hear this answer.
[673.60 --> 676.60]  Twitch.tv slash Minus Tech.
[676.60 --> 682.60]  All right. Let's see if we have any. Hey, hey, hey.
[682.60 --> 686.60]  We got Paul from Newegg.
[686.60 --> 690.60]  Tell Josh it was 29C in Southern California today.
[690.60 --> 691.60]  Hey, Paul.
[691.60 --> 692.60]  We'll see you next week.
[692.60 --> 696.60]  So really, we're just a stopover for you on the way to go visit Newegg TV.
[696.60 --> 697.60]  Oh, it's a publicity tour.
[697.60 --> 698.60]  This should be a shout out to Logan, right?
[698.60 --> 700.60]  Just the fact that I'm wearing like a sport coat.
[700.60 --> 701.60]  Now, here's the other thing.
[701.60 --> 702.60]  Degrees Celsius.
[702.60 --> 703.60]  I understand.
[703.60 --> 707.60]  Like, so I'm from the States, but I understand that when it comes to processors.
[707.60 --> 712.60]  But when I got in the rental car and I'm trying to set the temperature, I'm like, is 18 good?
[712.60 --> 715.60]  Or do I want to be at 12 or 26?
[715.60 --> 717.60]  26 is good and then I'm sweating bullets.
[717.60 --> 720.60]  Yeah, it was just throwing me off.
[720.60 --> 721.60]  26 is a little hot for the car.
[721.60 --> 722.60]  Yeah, it is.
[722.60 --> 723.60]  It is actually.
[723.60 --> 724.60]  You know, it's not that cold up here.
[724.60 --> 731.60]  And then that gets you all sweaty so that when you arrive here, you get to walk into our garage, which is not warm.
[731.60 --> 732.60]  And then it starts to freeze.
[732.60 --> 733.60]  Yeah.
[733.60 --> 734.60]  Yeah.
[734.60 --> 735.60]  So there's a whole phase change thing going on right here.
[735.60 --> 737.60]  So what are you not going on with Newegg TV?
[737.60 --> 738.60]  I'm curious.
[738.60 --> 740.60]  There's that one of the things you can't talk about.
[740.60 --> 741.60]  Top secret.
[741.60 --> 742.60]  Give away all of Paul's.
[742.60 --> 746.60]  Hey, never said I was going directly to Newegg TV, but I might be in that general area.
[746.60 --> 747.60]  Ah.
[747.60 --> 748.60]  A little secret agent thing.
[748.60 --> 754.60]  I can either confirm or deny that I might be in LA sometime in the next two to three years.
[754.60 --> 755.60]  Thank you for that.
[755.60 --> 756.60]  This guy's just evasive.
[756.60 --> 758.60]  We just shouldn't ask him anything.
[758.60 --> 759.60]  It's working.
[759.60 --> 760.60]  Yes.
[760.60 --> 762.60]  Do you know of any problems with YouTube today?
[762.60 --> 763.60]  Sorry, I don't.
[763.60 --> 767.60]  There are probably problems with YouTube today because it's YouTube.
[767.60 --> 768.60]  Yeah.
[768.60 --> 769.60]  Oh, you skip over that one.
[769.60 --> 770.60]  Hi, here we go.
[770.60 --> 772.60]  Adam S says, Josh, the R4 changed my life.
[772.60 --> 773.60]  Also, the note is amazing.
[773.60 --> 775.60]  How would you like to address that?
[775.60 --> 776.60]  You're amazing.
[776.60 --> 777.60]  That's awesome.
[777.60 --> 778.60]  Yeah.
[778.60 --> 779.60]  That's what we do.
[779.60 --> 781.60]  I mean, honestly, like when we make this stuff, it's awesome to hear that because believe
[781.60 --> 784.60]  it or not, a lot of work goes into designing a case.
[784.60 --> 789.60]  It's very hard to differentiate on such a standard platform.
[789.60 --> 792.60]  This is actually a great discussion topic.
[792.60 --> 797.60]  Why don't you tell us a little bit about the process that Fractal and probably any case manufacturer
[797.60 --> 799.60]  goes through to bring something to market?
[799.60 --> 802.60]  So, you know, there's multiple stages that it goes through.
[802.60 --> 804.60]  I mean, the first thing is always listening, right?
[804.60 --> 806.60]  You want to hear what everybody wants.
[806.60 --> 807.60]  It's my listening face.
[807.60 --> 808.60]  Yeah, I can tell.
[808.60 --> 809.60]  Yeah.
[809.60 --> 814.60]  So the difficult thing about making a case or making any product for that matter is you
[814.60 --> 818.60]  basically have to appease as many people as possible and knowing that you're probably
[818.60 --> 819.60]  going to alienate some.
[819.60 --> 822.60]  It'd be like 20 people trying to order one pizza, right?
[822.60 --> 823.60]  You can't go, everybody want crust.
[823.60 --> 824.60]  Okay.
[824.60 --> 825.60]  Yeah, we're good with that.
[825.60 --> 826.60]  Everybody wants sauce.
[826.60 --> 827.60]  We're good with that.
[827.60 --> 828.60]  Pepperoni.
[828.60 --> 829.60]  No.
[829.60 --> 830.60]  Okay.
[830.60 --> 831.60]  Cheese.
[831.60 --> 832.60]  No.
[832.60 --> 833.60]  Okay.
[833.60 --> 834.60]  So you kind of have to look at what-
[834.60 --> 835.60]  To be clear, your pizza has sauce and crust, but no cheese.
[835.60 --> 836.60]  Pepperoni.
[836.60 --> 837.60]  You need to follow.
[837.60 --> 838.60]  You need to focus.
[838.60 --> 840.60]  But yeah, so I mean, there's a lot of it that goes through it.
[840.60 --> 844.60]  There's a lot of internal back and forth and getting input from people and, you know,
[844.60 --> 848.60]  and then also we kind of go out to experts in the industry, other experts in the industry.
[848.60 --> 849.60]  They never ask me anything.
[849.60 --> 850.60]  Yeah, it's okay.
[850.60 --> 852.60]  Cause we know what the answer is going to be, you know?
[852.60 --> 857.60]  But you know, it's, it's very much taking feedback and that's why you see like an R4 and
[857.60 --> 859.60]  there was an R3 before that and an R2.
[859.60 --> 860.60]  It's like each one of those is an evolution.
[860.60 --> 863.60]  We've taken feedback in and same thing with the XLR2.
[863.60 --> 868.60]  We moved away from the thermal chamber design and we caught some flack for it from some
[868.60 --> 869.60]  people.
[869.60 --> 870.60]  And then we had other people like, Oh, thank God.
[870.60 --> 871.60]  This is exactly what I wanted.
[871.60 --> 872.60]  I wanted a big open case.
[872.60 --> 875.60]  I wanted plenty of room to mount water cooling gear.
[875.60 --> 879.60]  So, and then you go into prototyping and then you go into getting your first batch run and
[879.60 --> 880.60]  make sure everything's right.
[880.60 --> 882.60]  Tell us about the prototyping process.
[882.60 --> 886.60]  I mean, just so they have some context, you don't have to give an exact number, but to
[886.60 --> 892.60]  get the first case back, the first physical case, give me, you can give me a huge range.
[892.60 --> 896.60]  Like it could, you know, be like, you know, enormous range, but give me some kind of a range.
[896.60 --> 901.60]  What does it actually cost a manufacturer to get that first case that doesn't even look
[901.60 --> 903.60]  right and doesn't fit together properly?
[903.60 --> 904.60]  Yeah.
[904.60 --> 907.60]  There's, so there's not an exact dollar amount because it's kind of amortized over the whole
[907.60 --> 908.60]  production cost.
[908.60 --> 913.60]  So basically it's built into the fact that you're going to be making 11 teen of these,
[913.60 --> 914.60]  you know, right?
[914.60 --> 919.60]  So, but to give you an idea sometimes of like how special it is, like sometimes we'll fly
[919.60 --> 924.60]  someone to the factory and it'll come back in the seat next to them on the plane, you know,
[924.60 --> 926.60]  because you want to make sure that like, okay, this is what came off.
[926.60 --> 927.60]  Is everything right?
[927.60 --> 930.60]  You don't want to be like, okay, first production sample, ship it out.
[930.60 --> 932.60]  And then it's like, oh, that's what Brown did for me.
[932.60 --> 936.60]  It just totally trashed the production sample and now it set us back four weeks.
[936.60 --> 937.60]  So, right.
[937.60 --> 941.60]  Not only that, but yeah, I mean with the communication with the factory, you could have something like,
[941.60 --> 944.60]  oh no, no, it was fine before we sent it.
[944.60 --> 945.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[945.60 --> 946.60]  You don't have to redo that.
[946.60 --> 947.60]  Yeah.
[947.60 --> 948.60]  Yeah.
[948.60 --> 950.60]  It was flat when we sent it, that's just how we did it.
[950.60 --> 953.60]  But yeah, it's, so it's, it's very much a very tricky process.
[953.60 --> 958.60]  And then you have to, it'll be the little things that will get you to, you know, things that
[958.60 --> 962.60]  aren't really revolutionary that there's so many things to check on a case because physically
[962.60 --> 963.60]  it's a large object, right?
[963.60 --> 965.60]  So it's like, are all the bends, right?
[965.60 --> 966.60]  All the creases, right?
[966.60 --> 967.60]  Do all the panels fit, right?
[967.60 --> 970.60]  And something as small as making panels fit can be, okay.
[970.60 --> 971.60]  It's the radius of the bend.
[971.60 --> 973.60]  It's the type of metal that you use.
[973.60 --> 974.60]  It's.
[974.60 --> 977.60]  Well, Silverstone never got it figured out with a case like the TJ07, where every TJ07,
[977.60 --> 981.60]  actually has side panels that are fitted to it.
[981.60 --> 986.60]  And they, they haven't actually managed to make, cause you can't necessarily take the
[986.60 --> 988.60]  panels off one TJ07 and put them on another one.
[988.60 --> 992.60]  So that should give you guys some idea how tricky that might actually be.
[992.60 --> 993.60]  Yeah.
[993.60 --> 996.60]  And then you add sound deadening material to it and mass production to it.
[996.60 --> 997.60]  Yeah.
[997.60 --> 1001.60]  And everything has to be, you know, a lot of times we'll get stuff like, why don't you
[1001.60 --> 1002.60]  add this?
[1002.60 --> 1003.60]  Why don't you add this?
[1003.60 --> 1004.60]  Why don't you add that?
[1004.60 --> 1006.60]  And it's like, yeah, everything does add to the cost of the case.
[1006.60 --> 1009.60]  Um, so again, we're always trying to hit a good value point.
[1009.60 --> 1013.60]  So we want to try and offer as many features as possible without like, you know, breaking
[1013.60 --> 1014.60]  the bank for a lot of people.
[1014.60 --> 1017.60]  So we would try and go with the key features that we think are important.
[1017.60 --> 1021.60]  And you know, our Facebook page, we get tons of input from our fans all the time about,
[1021.60 --> 1022.60]  Hey, I like this.
[1022.60 --> 1023.60]  Could you change this?
[1023.60 --> 1024.60]  Could you do that?
[1024.60 --> 1028.60]  And believe it or not, as hokey as it sounds, all that does make it back to our production
[1028.60 --> 1029.60]  team.
[1029.60 --> 1030.60]  We do take everything back.
[1030.60 --> 1031.60]  All right.
[1031.60 --> 1034.60]  We do have a couple of, we do have a couple of questions from the forum thread.
[1034.60 --> 1038.60]  So I've got one guy who's asking a couple of things.
[1038.60 --> 1043.60]  So why move the reset switch to the top of the R4 instead of being covered by the door?
[1043.60 --> 1046.60]  And his other question, actually here, I'll give you that question first.
[1046.60 --> 1048.60]  So what's, what's the reasoning behind that?
[1048.60 --> 1049.60]  Thank you, by the way.
[1049.60 --> 1050.60]  Okay.
[1050.60 --> 1051.60]  Yeah.
[1051.60 --> 1052.60]  See, there you go.
[1052.60 --> 1053.60]  There's the answer, right?
[1053.60 --> 1057.60]  Um, you know, we do take feedback, uh, and we look at the overall feedback and you know,
[1057.60 --> 1062.60]  if we get like 85% feedback on something, we'll say, okay, you know, as much as we thought
[1062.60 --> 1065.60]  it was a good idea to begin with, maybe that's not where the industry's at now.
[1065.60 --> 1068.60]  Or at the very least, if our customers are talking, we want to listen.
[1068.60 --> 1072.60]  So we had strong feedback that people wanted it on the top of the case.
[1072.60 --> 1074.60]  So there you go.
[1074.60 --> 1075.60]  Okay.
[1075.60 --> 1079.60]  Demos asks from the forum threads, guys, there's a forum thread in the cases and power supply
[1079.60 --> 1083.60]  section on linustech tips.com, uh, where we had taken questions for Josh from last week's
[1083.60 --> 1084.60]  live stream.
[1084.60 --> 1089.60]  Uh, would switching from a fractal arc MIDI to a define R4 bring about a significant
[1089.60 --> 1090.60]  noise reduction?
[1090.60 --> 1091.60]  Yes.
[1091.60 --> 1092.60]  There you go.
[1092.60 --> 1093.60]  Yeah.
[1093.60 --> 1094.60]  You're, you're moving into our silent case.
[1094.60 --> 1097.60]  Uh, so there's gonna be a couple of different things going on there.
[1097.60 --> 1101.60]  You're gonna have the sound deadening capabilities of the, you know, insulation material, the bitumen
[1101.60 --> 1102.60]  that we have.
[1102.60 --> 1105.60]  And then you're also going to have the mod event blocks for the fan vents that you're not
[1105.60 --> 1106.60]  using.
[1106.60 --> 1108.60]  So you can actually block off the vent.
[1108.60 --> 1110.60]  So sounds not escaping from there.
[1110.60 --> 1111.60]  All right.
[1111.60 --> 1112.60]  So future lives.
[1112.60 --> 1113.60]  Let's go to some Twitter questions here.
[1113.60 --> 1115.60]  Future live stream guest suggestion.
[1115.60 --> 1116.60]  Alex from MSI.
[1116.60 --> 1117.60]  He seems funnier than the fractal guy.
[1117.60 --> 1118.60]  That is entirely possible.
[1118.60 --> 1120.60]  You know, you know, Alex, right?
[1120.60 --> 1121.60]  Yeah.
[1121.60 --> 1122.60]  Yeah.
[1122.60 --> 1123.60]  Okay.
[1123.60 --> 1124.60]  Yeah.
[1124.60 --> 1125.60]  I think Alex is funnier than you.
[1125.60 --> 1126.60]  I get that all the time.
[1126.60 --> 1127.60]  Okay.
[1127.60 --> 1128.60]  Josh, what is your favorite fractal design case?
[1128.60 --> 1129.60]  Hmm.
[1129.60 --> 1131.60]  Uh, personally, ArcMidi R2.
[1131.60 --> 1132.60]  Why?
[1132.60 --> 1133.60]  It's just so awesome.
[1133.60 --> 1138.60]  I mean, I'm, I've always been more of like a, uh, high performance, you know, computer
[1138.60 --> 1139.60]  enthusiast.
[1139.60 --> 1141.60]  So for me, I liked the, the flexibility with it.
[1141.60 --> 1144.60]  Although the XLR2 does have a lot of options for liquid coins.
[1144.60 --> 1149.60]  So those two are the top, but probably ArcMidi R2.
[1149.60 --> 1153.60]  So tell us a little bit about the kinds of systems that Biohazard used to build.
[1153.60 --> 1156.60]  You say that you're, you know, a little thing or two about high performance.
[1156.60 --> 1158.60]  So, so what was the price range?
[1158.60 --> 1163.60]  Uh, the average sales price was in the eight to $12,000 range.
[1163.60 --> 1166.60]  So go ahead and start flaming me right now for being overpriced and stuff like that.
[1166.60 --> 1167.60]  Yeah.
[1167.60 --> 1168.60]  I'm used to it.
[1168.60 --> 1169.60]  I'm used to it.
[1169.60 --> 1170.60]  Yeah.
[1170.60 --> 1173.60]  But what we did is, you know, we focused a lot on liquid cooling and high performance cooling.
[1173.60 --> 1176.60]  So we did everything from air cooling to liquid.
[1176.60 --> 1178.60]  We played with, uh, techs and pelts for a while.
[1178.60 --> 1183.60]  Um, and then we got into phase change and then we had, uh, one of the only multi evaporator
[1183.60 --> 1185.60]  phase change systems on the market.
[1185.60 --> 1188.60]  So basically it's just very high end custom stuff.
[1188.60 --> 1193.60]  Most of our stuff was one offs and it'd be, you know, I guess bleeding edge hardware.
[1193.60 --> 1194.60]  Cause if you're spending that much money, why not?
[1194.60 --> 1195.60]  Right.
[1195.60 --> 1196.60]  Right.
[1196.60 --> 1197.60]  Okay.
[1197.60 --> 1198.60]  Here we go.
[1198.60 --> 1202.60]  Any, how does Swedish design contribute to fractals approach to cases?
[1202.60 --> 1207.60]  So why don't, why isn't it missing one screw when you try to put it together?
[1207.60 --> 1209.60]  I guess it's the question he's trying to ask.
[1209.60 --> 1210.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[1210.60 --> 1213.60]  We're in a lot of our, uh, instructions and pictures and stuff like that.
[1213.60 --> 1214.60]  And it's shipped flat.
[1214.60 --> 1216.60]  No, we, uh, yeah.
[1216.60 --> 1219.60]  So where it really comes in is a lot of the design cues, the visual design.
[1219.60 --> 1223.60]  I mean, you know, the fact that design is part of our name shows how much we focus on that.
[1223.60 --> 1225.60]  It's going to be much more minimalistic.
[1225.60 --> 1231.60]  Uh, you know, we obviously have, um, I guess more of a subdued appearance than some cases
[1231.60 --> 1232.60]  out there.
[1232.60 --> 1233.60]  And it's not saying that the other ones are bad.
[1233.60 --> 1237.60]  It's just that you're going to see people gravitate towards different things.
[1237.60 --> 1241.60]  What I liked when I first got into the PC industry is not exactly what I like right now.
[1241.60 --> 1246.60]  So yeah, you see a lot more in the design of the white and the black and that sort of thing.
[1246.60 --> 1250.60]  What case is your personal computer in?
[1250.60 --> 1252.60]  My personal computer is in an R4.
[1252.60 --> 1253.60]  Is it?
[1253.60 --> 1254.60]  Yes.
[1254.60 --> 1255.60]  Really?
[1255.60 --> 1256.60]  Yes.
[1256.60 --> 1257.60]  Why?
[1257.60 --> 1261.60]  I just, I would have expected you to have a case that is more, that is more water cooling friendly.
[1261.60 --> 1263.60]  Do you not water cool anymore?
[1263.60 --> 1266.60]  So, uh, no, I don't.
[1266.60 --> 1267.60]  Really?
[1267.60 --> 1268.60]  Because I do not have the time.
[1268.60 --> 1273.60]  And you know, liquid cooling is so awesome until something goes wrong and you start getting
[1273.60 --> 1276.60]  that drip and that little puddle sitting on your video card and you're like, oh crap.
[1276.60 --> 1280.60]  Well, you know, Asus had that, uh, I think they had a couple motherboards that allowed you
[1280.60 --> 1283.60]  to individually turn off the PCIe slots for diagnostics.
[1283.60 --> 1284.60]  Mm-hmm.
[1284.60 --> 1287.60]  So I think it was about a 400, $450 board or something like that.
[1287.60 --> 1290.60]  So you're trying to tell me you don't have one of those then?
[1290.60 --> 1291.60]  No, no, I don't.
[1291.60 --> 1293.60]  Because my, my computer at home.
[1293.60 --> 1295.60]  So actually I have multiple, right?
[1295.60 --> 1298.60]  Because just like you, I don't know if they can see if you get, you know, peers all over
[1298.60 --> 1299.60]  the place, same sort of thing.
[1299.60 --> 1302.60]  It's like, I have a media center PC in my bedroom.
[1302.60 --> 1303.60]  How lame is that?
[1303.60 --> 1305.60]  You know, so I can Netflix stream.
[1305.60 --> 1306.60]  Yeah.
[1306.60 --> 1308.60]  And a wife that puts up with it, which is, you know, probably even better.
[1308.60 --> 1309.60]  That's like half the battle.
[1309.60 --> 1310.60]  Yeah.
[1310.60 --> 1311.60]  That's, that's like three quarters of the battle.
[1311.60 --> 1312.60]  Yeah.
[1312.60 --> 1313.60]  Yeah.
[1313.60 --> 1317.60]  It's like, we have all the toys that we're allowed to have is basically what it boils down to.
[1317.60 --> 1318.60]  So yeah.
[1318.60 --> 1322.60]  What's the spec of your personal rig?
[1322.60 --> 1324.60]  Find any time for gaming anymore?
[1324.60 --> 1325.60]  Uh, yes.
[1325.60 --> 1326.60]  Yes.
[1326.60 --> 1327.60]  Sometime.
[1327.60 --> 1328.60]  Um, it's usually switching.
[1328.60 --> 1330.60]  Um, right now though, it's old.
[1330.60 --> 1337.60]  It's a 2,500 K and I'm running, um, 279 70s.
[1337.60 --> 1338.60]  Yeah.
[1338.60 --> 1339.60]  That's really old.
[1339.60 --> 1340.60]  That's really crappy.
[1340.60 --> 1341.60]  Older.
[1341.60 --> 1342.60]  Older.
[1342.60 --> 1345.60]  Now some parts of it are old, you know, and some parts of it are.
[1345.60 --> 1346.60]  Yeah.
[1346.60 --> 1347.60]  The Define R4 is really old.
[1347.60 --> 1348.60]  When was that released?
[1348.60 --> 1349.60]  A month ago?
[1349.60 --> 1351.60]  Uh, no, actually July 20th roughly.
[1351.60 --> 1352.60]  Oh.
[1352.60 --> 1353.60]  Why don't I have one yet?
[1353.60 --> 1355.60]  Uh, cause I saw your unboxing video on it.
[1355.60 --> 1356.60]  Oh.
[1356.60 --> 1357.60]  Okay then.
[1357.60 --> 1358.60]  Shucks.
[1358.60 --> 1359.60]  That makes sense.
[1359.60 --> 1365.60]  Uh, speaking of gaming, we were talking about Assassin's Creed 3 at our office today.
[1365.60 --> 1368.60]  Or Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag.
[1368.60 --> 1370.60]  Um, what's your favorite game series?
[1370.60 --> 1371.60]  Or game?
[1371.60 --> 1373.60]  So, game series, franchises, whatever.
[1373.60 --> 1376.60]  Uh, so Hitman, awesome.
[1376.60 --> 1378.60]  Absolution, kinda lost me a little bit.
[1378.60 --> 1381.60]  Uh, Bioshock, I'm looking forward to Infinite.
[1381.60 --> 1382.60]  And then Assassin's-
[1382.60 --> 1383.60]  Really?
[1383.60 --> 1384.60]  Yes.
[1384.60 --> 1385.60]  It was so bad.
[1385.60 --> 1386.60]  Yes, but you don't get-
[1386.60 --> 1387.60]  Okay, did you play it?
[1387.60 --> 1388.60]  Yes.
[1388.60 --> 1389.60]  How far in did you get?
[1389.60 --> 1390.60]  I actually finished it.
[1390.60 --> 1391.60]  No!
[1391.60 --> 1395.60]  I'm like, Christ- or, I'm like, was it- was it the original Crisis?
[1395.60 --> 1396.60]  I didn't finish that.
[1396.60 --> 1397.60]  You didn't finish that?
[1397.60 --> 1398.60]  No.
[1398.60 --> 1399.60]  The original Crisis wasn't bad.
[1399.60 --> 1400.60]  I mean-
[1400.60 --> 1402.60]  It went all- yeah, but it went all aliens and stuff.
[1402.60 --> 1403.60]  Oh, the aliens-
[1403.60 --> 1405.60]  And then it was like, okay, they jumped the shark, you know?
[1405.60 --> 1408.60]  I know, okay, the alien bit wasn't actually a lot of fun.
[1408.60 --> 1413.60]  But the- I didn't mind- I- I know a lot of people complained about the carrier bit at the
[1413.60 --> 1414.60]  end.
[1414.60 --> 1415.60]  I didn't mind it.
[1415.60 --> 1418.60]  Were you- were you fighting- I mean, it was really hard and I died a lot, but it's-
[1418.60 --> 1423.60]  Like, a final boss- a final boss fight is supposed to be difficult.
[1423.60 --> 1424.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[1424.60 --> 1425.60]  Right.
[1425.60 --> 1426.60]  So I- I don't actually have a problem with that.
[1426.60 --> 1427.60]  But, okay, fine, whatever.
[1427.60 --> 1432.60]  This killed the easy level on how- if Linus can beat it or not.
[1432.60 --> 1434.60]  If it takes him about four or five times, it's the easy level.
[1434.60 --> 1435.60]  Thank you.
[1435.60 --> 1436.60]  You know what-
[1436.60 --> 1437.60]  You're blood for punishment.
[1437.60 --> 1439.60]  He's never actually played games with me, so he doesn't-
[1439.60 --> 1440.60]  I have.
[1440.60 --> 1441.60]  I played you in Battlefield 3.
[1441.60 --> 1443.60]  Okay, but I don't play Battlefield.
[1443.60 --> 1446.60]  Okay, whatever, man.
[1446.60 --> 1449.60]  Yeah, so Assassin's Creed, though.
[1449.60 --> 1451.60]  Yeah, that's always been a favorite franchise there.
[1451.60 --> 1452.60]  Yeah, me too.
[1452.60 --> 1454.60]  You know, the best thing is, like, you know, if you can't get past a certain area or whatever
[1454.60 --> 1455.60]  and you get so pissed off-
[1455.60 --> 1456.60]  You can just hit the easy button?
[1456.60 --> 1457.60]  Is that- is that it, you guys?
[1457.60 --> 1458.60]  No.
[1458.60 --> 1459.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[1459.60 --> 1460.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[1460.60 --> 1462.60]  You know, it's like, I'll just check out your aggression on somebody else.
[1462.60 --> 1463.60]  You know?
[1463.60 --> 1468.60]  Okay, speaking of the Crysis series, so you're running a 2500K.
[1468.60 --> 1471.60]  You've been keeping up with the Intel, AMD, arms race.
[1471.60 --> 1473.60]  Have you seen the PS4 specs?
[1473.60 --> 1477.60]  No, because I saw all the negative publicity from everybody that watched the announcement
[1477.60 --> 1478.60]  and everything like that.
[1478.60 --> 1479.60]  I actually didn't watch the announcement.
[1479.60 --> 1480.60]  No pictures of the actual system.
[1480.60 --> 1481.60]  Yeah, I heard it was just terrible.
[1481.60 --> 1482.60]  Yeah, the controller was it.
[1482.60 --> 1483.60]  I think that's all they showed.
[1483.60 --> 1488.60]  And the controller just looks like some kind of weird, like, space-age six-axis.
[1488.60 --> 1489.60]  You're just kind of like-
[1489.60 --> 1492.60]  It's like a six-axis, but slap a touchscreen right in the middle.
[1492.60 --> 1493.60]  Yeah.
[1493.60 --> 1494.60]  Yeah.
[1494.60 --> 1495.60]  It's like, yeah.
[1495.60 --> 1496.60]  Victory.
[1496.60 --> 1503.60]  So, okay, so if you could have the perfect- what do you think is missing from PC games
[1503.60 --> 1505.60]  that- and, sorry, I'm going somewhere with this.
[1505.60 --> 1510.60]  So the PS4 has an x86 multi-core processor, so it's going to be as close to a PC as a PC
[1510.60 --> 1514.60]  as we've been since probably the original Xbox.
[1514.60 --> 1515.60]  Mm-hmm.
[1515.60 --> 1519.60]  Because it's got an AMD Radeon class graphics card, it's got a bunch of GDDR5, it's got
[1519.60 --> 1522.60]  an x86 processor, and it made by AMD.
[1522.60 --> 1527.60]  So no funny power cell nonsense, none of that.
[1527.60 --> 1531.60]  What do you hope that this affects?
[1531.60 --> 1534.60]  And I'll let you answer this one, too, because I don't know if you weighed in last time.
[1534.60 --> 1536.60]  What do you hope this affects for PC gaming?
[1536.60 --> 1538.60]  Because do you own a console?
[1538.60 --> 1541.60]  Yeah, I own an Xbox 360 Kinect and that's mainly for my kids.
[1541.60 --> 1542.60]  Right, okay.
[1542.60 --> 1543.60]  So about right then.
[1543.60 --> 1544.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[1544.60 --> 1549.60]  Like you, like I think I've played it maybe like three times, unless I'm doing like Wii
[1549.60 --> 1551.60]  Dance 2 or something, you know, rocking out to the X-dance.
[1551.60 --> 1553.60]  Yeah, by the way, Wii Dance actually isn't for Xbox 360.
[1553.60 --> 1558.60]  No, not Wii Dance, like the Wii Dance, I can't remember what it is.
[1558.60 --> 1561.60]  But yeah, I don't know.
[1561.60 --> 1568.60]  I mean, the thing is like with, I'm such a PC gamer that it's hard for consoles to excite
[1568.60 --> 1569.60]  me.
[1569.60 --> 1573.60]  You know, I look at it's like, you know, flash in the pan is going to be good for the first
[1573.60 --> 1575.60]  year and then it gets eclipsed.
[1575.60 --> 1576.60]  Right.
[1576.60 --> 1579.60]  You know, and then it's like, for the first year you're going to hear all the crap about,
[1579.60 --> 1582.60]  oh, PC games dead, look at the graphics, look at this, look at that.
[1582.60 --> 1584.60]  And it's like, yeah, that's good.
[1584.60 --> 1588.60]  And then year two rolls around and it's like, still holding its own pretty good.
[1588.60 --> 1591.60]  And year three rolls around, it's like, okay, yeah, it's starting to look like crap.
[1591.60 --> 1592.60]  Okay.
[1592.60 --> 1595.60]  So tell him the news that you told me the other night.
[1595.60 --> 1597.60]  That's actually just freaking amazing.
[1597.60 --> 1601.60]  One thing personally, I'm vicariously happy for console gamers.
[1601.60 --> 1604.60]  They can finally get something that doesn't look like poop because it's been a really long
[1604.60 --> 1605.60]  time.
[1605.60 --> 1606.60]  Yeah.
[1606.60 --> 1613.60]  But companies like Ubisoft are basically going, oh, we're sorry, PC gamers, that we've just
[1613.60 --> 1615.60]  like been porting you crap for years.
[1615.60 --> 1616.60]  Yes.
[1616.60 --> 1620.60]  Now that everything is x86 based for me developing for PC and porting down.
[1620.60 --> 1621.60]  Awesome.
[1621.60 --> 1623.60]  So that is just kind of fantastic.
[1623.60 --> 1627.60]  Which as much as I love the Assassin's Creed franchise, it's like, okay, why do I do
[1627.60 --> 1631.60]  have to wait three months after the console launch date for a port?
[1631.60 --> 1634.60]  That, which is horrible and it sucks waiting.
[1634.60 --> 1638.60]  And then I just played on my PC with the controller anyways, because the controls for keyboard and
[1638.60 --> 1640.60]  mouse are just so whacked out and weird.
[1640.60 --> 1644.60]  What was it like revelations or whatever, where they'd still pop up like the icons from
[1644.60 --> 1645.60]  like the console game.
[1645.60 --> 1646.60]  Yeah.
[1646.60 --> 1647.60]  Press x.
[1647.60 --> 1648.60]  Is that a GW?
[1648.60 --> 1649.60]  What the, you're trying to get it, you don't know what's going on.
[1649.60 --> 1650.60]  Yeah.
[1650.60 --> 1655.60]  It's like, how much work would it have been to just have like the game actually check and
[1655.60 --> 1658.60]  see what the key binding is before telling me to press something.
[1658.60 --> 1659.60]  It's not a lot of work.
[1659.60 --> 1662.60]  Can you do me the common decency and just lying to me for a little bit and make it seem
[1662.60 --> 1665.60]  like you developed this from the ground up or at least didn't last minute port it.
[1665.60 --> 1667.60]  It gets ugly, but yeah.
[1667.60 --> 1672.60]  And like, it's not just Ubisoft too, but at least there's now a company and like, okay,
[1672.60 --> 1676.60]  they're saying it now that it's easy, but like hopefully everyone's going to try and take
[1676.60 --> 1680.60]  this angle now where you develop first for PC and then chop down and port down.
[1680.60 --> 1681.60]  Mm-hmm.
[1681.60 --> 1683.60]  Because they're also saying like Watch Dogs, which is coming out soon.
[1683.60 --> 1688.60]  It's coming out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PC and I think Xbox maybe too or whatever,
[1688.60 --> 1691.60]  but I'm just giving that scale because that's the one that matters for this story.
[1691.60 --> 1693.60]  PlayStation 3 is a chopped down version.
[1693.60 --> 1697.60]  If you played on PlayStation 3 versus PlayStation 4, there's way more objects in the game.
[1697.60 --> 1698.60]  Gotcha.
[1698.60 --> 1700.60]  There's way more everything in the game.
[1700.60 --> 1701.60]  Graphically it looks way better.
[1701.60 --> 1702.60]  There's more stuff.
[1702.60 --> 1703.60]  It's just great.
[1703.60 --> 1707.60]  And then they haven't mentioned anything about PC directly, but I'm assuming it's the PlayStation 4 level.
[1707.60 --> 1708.60]  That should be the PlayStation, right.
[1708.60 --> 1709.60]  Yeah.
[1709.60 --> 1710.60]  Yeah.
[1710.60 --> 1715.60]  I mean, the other thing that excites me because I mean, we've pretty much gotten to the limit
[1715.60 --> 1719.60]  in terms of how far we can push a single core on a CPU.
[1719.60 --> 1722.60]  I mean, both AMD and Intel have basically just gone, yeah, we don't care anymore.
[1722.60 --> 1728.60]  Let's add more cores to them because it's way more power efficient and other platforms are going to push that trend as well
[1728.60 --> 1733.60]  because on things like tablets or game consoles, all of a sudden power consumption and cooling,
[1733.60 --> 1738.60]  it's like way more important than it is on a desktop PC where you've got all this like space.
[1738.60 --> 1739.60]  Yeah.
[1739.60 --> 1740.60]  Because you're spending $8,000.
[1740.60 --> 1743.60]  So the tower better be like the size of a grown man, right?
[1743.60 --> 1744.60]  Or half grown.
[1744.60 --> 1745.60]  Or half, yes.
[1745.60 --> 1746.60]  Thank you for that.
[1747.60 --> 1757.60]  So multi-core optimizations are one of the things that I think is really exciting about seeing an x86 CPU inside a next generation console,
[1757.60 --> 1762.60]  because all of a sudden we won't have to rely on proprietary technologies like Nvidia PhysX,
[1762.60 --> 1770.60]  because that to me is the Holy Grail of a truly next generation game where glass behaves like glass,
[1770.60 --> 1776.60]  not because it's scripted to behave like glass, but because it has all the attributes and properties of glass and therefore behaves like...
[1776.60 --> 1779.60]  Well, you could do splash damage, right? Legitimate splash damage.
[1779.60 --> 1780.60]  Legitimate splash damage.
[1780.60 --> 1782.60]  People could get cut by the glass. I mean...
[1782.60 --> 1783.60]  Yeah.
[1783.60 --> 1784.60]  That would be truly different.
[1784.60 --> 1789.60]  Yeah, you blow on a wall and the bullet doesn't take you out. It's the brick flying in from the RPG or something like that.
[1789.60 --> 1796.60]  Right, exactly. Where you could actually make it an integral part of gameplay, because we have the CPU power for it.
[1796.60 --> 1798.60]  Some rudimentary stuff anyway.
[1798.60 --> 1801.60]  Well, like back when Aegea was around, they always call it like a physics kill, right?
[1801.60 --> 1806.60]  Like if you could, you know, do something like that and hit a brick and there you like chop a tree down and then it falls on the hut.
[1806.60 --> 1816.60]  But it was always like, okay, I'm two feet away from it and I died. Or it's like I'm directly under it and get completely clobbered and you just somehow survive.
[1816.60 --> 1818.60]  Like, don't hit my ankle, I'm good. I'm gonna walk it off.
[1818.60 --> 1819.60]  Yeah.
[1819.60 --> 1820.60]  And it's always been kind of kludgy.
[1820.60 --> 1821.60]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[1821.60 --> 1822.60]  Yeah.
[1822.60 --> 1829.60]  And like games where they've implemented it, it's like, I mean, that's the thing that sort of kills me about PhysX is that the other platforms are not ready.
[1829.60 --> 1836.60]  So it's never going to be implemented in a way that's really compelling because I would love, I mean, that and then VR.
[1836.60 --> 1839.60]  Yeah. Oh, Oculus Rift with physics.
[1839.60 --> 1840.60]  Would be.
[1840.60 --> 1843.60]  With like that level of physics, it's just going to be absolutely fantastic.
[1843.60 --> 1844.60]  Yeah.
[1844.60 --> 1848.60]  So, you know, while we're all just kind of sitting here having.
[1848.60 --> 1849.60]  Put our own thing.
[1849.60 --> 1850.60]  Yeah.
[1850.60 --> 1854.60]  I guess, yeah, we could sort of see if anyone has anything to, uh, you guys should invite again.
[1854.60 --> 1855.60]  Wow.
[1855.60 --> 1856.60]  Look at this.
[1856.60 --> 1860.60]  The only thing people want to talk about when we bring you on as a guest is all the other people we should invite.
[1860.60 --> 1861.60]  I know, I know.
[1861.60 --> 1862.60]  I'm setting the bar so low.
[1862.60 --> 1864.60]  But, you know, I'm doing that for you.
[1864.60 --> 1869.60]  Um, for the fractal guy, do you guys offer modded parts like the panels I painted?
[1869.60 --> 1871.60]  Probably not, I would think.
[1871.60 --> 1873.60]  But, uh, hey, that looks pretty good.
[1873.60 --> 1875.60]  Yeah, it looks like you, uh, oh, the mesh.
[1875.60 --> 1876.60]  Yeah.
[1876.60 --> 1886.58]  Anything out, we're always looking at doing new stuff and some things may or may not be in the
[1886.58 --> 1887.58]  room.
[1887.58 --> 1888.58]  It works.
[1888.58 --> 1889.58]  Is that vague enough?
[1889.58 --> 1890.58]  That's vague enough.
[1890.58 --> 1891.58]  Vague, okay.
[1891.58 --> 1892.58]  All right.
[1892.58 --> 1897.58]  We already have, uh, oh, I think that's sort of a scary, uh, scary topic.
[1897.58 --> 1899.58]  Five times.
[1899.58 --> 1902.58]  30 inch monitors, five by one portrait or three by one landscape.
[1902.58 --> 1903.58]  Pros and cons?
[1903.58 --> 1908.58]  Portrait looks kind of cool in pictures, but then you have like, like if you talk about
[1908.58 --> 1913.58]  bezel space, like dead space for bezel space, if you look in those pictures and pay attention,
[1913.58 --> 1919.58]  there's like chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk all along your now landscape level view.
[1919.58 --> 1922.58]  Have you ever gamed in five plus five by one portrait?
[1922.58 --> 1924.58]  Limited, but yes.
[1924.58 --> 1926.58]  What would you say about the experience?
[1926.58 --> 1927.58]  Yeah.
[1927.58 --> 1931.58]  I, I did not thoroughly enjoy it.
[1931.58 --> 1934.58]  I would definitely go with like three by one landscape personally.
[1934.58 --> 1935.58]  Yeah.
[1935.58 --> 1936.58]  I'm going to have to say the same thing.
[1936.58 --> 1940.58]  We actually did an NCIX tech tips on five by one portrait.
[1940.58 --> 1944.58]  Um, and bezels were a definite issue.
[1944.58 --> 1946.58]  Uh, the other issue was game support.
[1946.58 --> 1948.58]  That is a weird resolution.
[1948.58 --> 1949.58]  Like.
[1949.58 --> 1950.58]  Yeah.
[1950.58 --> 1953.58]  Isn't there like a website like widescreen gaming or something like that?
[1953.58 --> 1954.58]  That like has all the hacks to where you can like.
[1954.58 --> 1956.58]  He had never heard of that before.
[1956.58 --> 1957.58]  I hadn't.
[1957.58 --> 1958.58]  Really?
[1958.58 --> 1963.58]  And even then there's fairly popular titles like Skyrim, for example, does not support
[1963.58 --> 1964.58]  surround period.
[1964.58 --> 1965.58]  Yeah.
[1965.58 --> 1969.58]  Even like normal surround three by 1080 does not support it.
[1969.58 --> 1973.58]  So if you're, so, so you're going to take that subset of games that work with surround
[1973.58 --> 1978.58]  and you're going to get a subset of games that work with your weird surround.
[1978.58 --> 1980.58]  Well, the problem is a lot of people don't have the money.
[1980.58 --> 1983.58]  Like I never knew about widescreen gaming because I have one monitor.
[1983.58 --> 1984.58]  Yeah.
[1984.58 --> 1985.58]  It never really mattered.
[1985.58 --> 1988.58]  And I had a square monitor for so long.
[1988.58 --> 1989.58]  Like, yeah, he wasn't cool.
[1989.58 --> 1991.58]  He didn't adopt a widescreen early on.
[1991.58 --> 1994.58]  Like I did with my Acer 1916 W.
[1994.58 --> 1996.58]  Blinging.
[1996.58 --> 1999.58]  Do you remember that monitor?
[1999.58 --> 2000.58]  Yeah.
[2000.58 --> 2001.58]  It was cheap.
[2001.58 --> 2002.58]  It was 200 bucks.
[2002.58 --> 2008.58]  It was a 1440 by 900 or some stupid resolution like that, where it was actually like, it was
[2008.58 --> 2011.58]  too, it was too small vertically to be useful for anything.
[2011.58 --> 2012.58]  Yeah.
[2012.58 --> 2013.58]  It's like Lamar Burton's.
[2013.58 --> 2014.58]  Yeah.
[2014.58 --> 2015.58]  Yeah.
[2015.58 --> 2016.58]  It was, it was basically like that.
[2016.58 --> 2021.58]  And then it was just, it was VGA only, which meant like awesome image quality.
[2021.58 --> 2022.58]  Yeah, exactly.
[2022.58 --> 2023.58]  8 bit.
[2023.58 --> 2025.58]  Well, you know, to kick it back real far for you.
[2025.58 --> 2027.58]  So like back when I was at Biohazard, we had-
[2027.58 --> 2028.58]  Yeah, you're old, hey?
[2028.58 --> 2029.58]  I know, I know.
[2029.58 --> 2035.58]  We had actually, one of the first 30 inch displays at 2560 by 1600.
[2035.58 --> 2038.58]  So if you remember when they first came out, it was like Dell and Apple.
[2038.58 --> 2039.58]  Apple.
[2039.58 --> 2040.58]  Yeah.
[2040.58 --> 2041.58]  Dell and Apple, the only two that had it.
[2041.58 --> 2046.58]  And then Samsung came out with one and they were gracious enough to let us use it for CES.
[2046.58 --> 2049.58]  And it was like back then, like all the system angerators were freaking out.
[2049.58 --> 2051.58]  Like, thank God I don't have to buy a Dell monitor.
[2051.58 --> 2054.58]  Now if there's anything wrong with that, but like, you know, when you have your own branded system,
[2054.58 --> 2055.58]  the last thing you want to be is like, and Dell.
[2055.58 --> 2056.58]  Yeah.
[2056.58 --> 2057.58]  And Apple.
[2057.58 --> 2058.58]  Yeah.
[2058.58 --> 2059.58]  And my competitors.
[2059.58 --> 2060.58]  Next time buy from them.
[2060.58 --> 2061.58]  Was that really, that was it?
[2061.58 --> 2062.58]  That was where you were-
[2062.58 --> 2063.58]  Yeah, that was it.
[2063.58 --> 2065.58]  And then the awkward pause.
[2065.58 --> 2068.58]  I'm beginning to think you're doing this on purpose.
[2068.58 --> 2069.58]  What?
[2069.58 --> 2070.58]  No.
[2070.58 --> 2072.58]  It's gotta be a production quality thing.
[2072.58 --> 2078.58]  Alright, so GTA, you guys should invite a game Dell developer guy.
[2078.58 --> 2079.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[2079.58 --> 2083.58]  I hope people realize they can play all their Xbox and PlayStation games on PC in the future.
[2083.58 --> 2085.58]  Okay, we're not talking about emulation.
[2085.58 --> 2088.58]  This is not a, we're not talking about emulators.
[2088.58 --> 2095.58]  What do you think of revolutionary case designs like Silverstone's 90 degrees, like the Fortress and the TJ-11?
[2095.58 --> 2096.58]  It's been around.
[2096.58 --> 2098.58]  Yeah, it's been around for a while, but-
[2098.58 --> 2103.58]  I mean, does the, okay here.
[2103.58 --> 2106.58]  Does the ATX form factor need a shakeup?
[2106.58 --> 2110.58]  Or was BTX's failure all the proof we really needed that it doesn't?
[2110.58 --> 2113.58]  Yeah, so we dealt with BTX back on as a system integrator.
[2113.58 --> 2115.58]  I mean, it's-
[2115.58 --> 2117.58]  Hold on, history lesson, guys, sorry.
[2117.58 --> 2127.58]  BTX was a standard from Intel that instead of having a standard power supply top, motherboard with the CPU here, the RAM here, and the slots here with the coolers facing down,
[2127.58 --> 2128.58]  that's ATX.
[2128.58 --> 2137.58]  BTX basically took that, brrrr it, and then it had standards for the CPU being located closer to the center, and then having intake specifically positioned over it.
[2137.58 --> 2138.58]  So, sorry, go ahead.
[2138.58 --> 2139.58]  So you dealt with that as a system-
[2139.58 --> 2144.58]  Yeah, but the problem there was like that heat pipes on like North Bridges and stuff weren't wicked.
[2144.58 --> 2151.58]  They were designed to work in the standard ATX form factor, so when you'd flip them over, all of a sudden it wouldn't work because it's gravity-fed.
[2151.58 --> 2153.58]  So that was just one of the issues.
[2153.58 --> 2156.58]  You know, the thing is like with, I guess what you'd call like revolutionary designs-
[2156.58 --> 2157.58]  Get it revolutionary?
[2157.58 --> 2159.58]  Yeah, ooh, you've got to revolve it.
[2159.58 --> 2170.58]  You know, the thing is, personally, for me, as long as it's done for like a legitimate reason, that makes sense, but if you're doing it just to do something different, then I think that pans out pretty quickly.
[2170.58 --> 2174.58]  You know, it's good to have change.
[2174.58 --> 2191.58]  You know, some things like, okay, so small form factor used to be like really hot for like a year and a half when it first came out, but like way back when, way back in my day, you know, there was like no performance hardware that small, and the cases were so cramped.
[2191.58 --> 2199.58]  And then now you see like, for example, like our Node 304 and other mini-ITX cases, you can get a pretty impressive system slammed into a small case.
[2199.58 --> 2205.58]  But it still comes down to like a usage scenario thing, right? Like some people, it's like, I don't care, I still want a full tower, you know?
[2205.58 --> 2209.58]  And some people like, I want to build the fastest system I can and like the smallest possible footprint.
[2209.58 --> 2219.58]  Okay, what about the argument that I should build an ITX machine such as a Node 304 or a BitPhoenix Prodigy or something in that sort of size class?
[2219.58 --> 2222.58]  What about the argument that I should build something like that for LAN gaming?
[2222.58 --> 2226.58]  Okay, so, you know, it makes sense, you know, for transportation portability.
[2226.58 --> 2229.58]  Obviously, we have a lot of people that buy them for that reason.
[2229.58 --> 2242.58]  But if you go to your local LANs, I think you see just as many people, like when we were at NetWare LANs, you know, we saw, you know, I think a couple XLs and you know, you see 800Ds and stuff like that.
[2242.58 --> 2244.58]  So it's like, yeah, lots of 800Ds at LANs.
[2244.58 --> 2253.58]  Yeah, there's just as many, you know, gamers out there that want to run a full tower because, you know, to them it's like, you know, 29 days of the month, I'm sitting next to my desk.
[2253.58 --> 2258.58]  And that's one of the things like, okay, so here, let me spin this into talking about myself.
[2258.58 --> 2260.58]  You know, like the XL, right?
[2260.58 --> 2266.58]  The Defiant XL and now the XLR2 are heavier cases because they're big and they're made out of steel.
[2266.58 --> 2272.58]  And the thing was, when I was a system integrator, we'd always get told that company X or Y had such light cases.
[2272.58 --> 2276.58]  And it's like, okay, good for you. Now fill it full of gear. How light is it?
[2276.58 --> 2279.58]  It's like empty. Okay. It's half the weight of this other case.
[2279.58 --> 2284.58]  Full, it's five pounds less at a 50 pound mark. So it's not as much of a big push.
[2284.58 --> 2290.58]  I see. So it's kind of, you have to look at it inside the product envelope of how is it going to be used in usage scenarios.
[2290.58 --> 2296.58]  Although there are extreme examples. I mean, your brother has a modded out Cosmos R2. What does that thing weigh?
[2296.58 --> 2301.58]  It's like 110 pounds or something. I'd have to get the actual weight from him.
[2301.58 --> 2307.58]  But he put a crossbar on it and the kind of the running joke is he's the only person who can pick it up realistically.
[2307.58 --> 2313.58]  Like I can pick it up, but I'm like, Oh God. He can kind of just beast mode it, pick it up and walk around.
[2313.58 --> 2318.58]  So the idea is if he goes to a land, he can just put it wherever and it's not a big deal because no one can steal it.
[2318.58 --> 2320.58]  Right. Okay.
[2320.58 --> 2323.58]  They'd need like a bobsled team of like four people to come and-
[2323.58 --> 2328.58]  But it'd be so awesome to be like at the land, put like a Kensington lock on it to the table just in case.
[2328.58 --> 2330.58]  He has like a dragon the whole table with it.
[2331.58 --> 2335.58]  Would the Kensington lock hold up? That is the real question here.
[2335.58 --> 2339.58]  That'd be a- Yeah, hang it from the ceiling. Just don't sit underneath it, you know? That'd be a stress test.
[2339.58 --> 2340.58]  Yeah.
[2340.58 --> 2342.58]  Probably just pull the whole ceiling down though. You know, like the raptors would come out.
[2342.58 --> 2347.58]  Oh, that thing is so heavy. Like I, like honestly, I had trouble moving Cosmos 2 around without anything in it.
[2347.58 --> 2356.58]  And part of it is the weight. It weighs 50 pounds. But the reality of it is, I can take a 30 pound case, fill it full of hardware to the point where it weighs 50 pounds.
[2356.58 --> 2359.58]  I can move that around no problem. Part of the problem with the-
[2359.58 --> 2360.58]  It's huge.
[2360.58 --> 2369.58]  Dude, it's my entire wingspan large. So I can't really like get it. And in the box, I actually, did I show you how close it was to not fitting in the trunk of my car?
[2369.58 --> 2370.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[2370.58 --> 2379.58]  Like you have to actually borrow a minivan to buy one. And like, like we water cooled it. We, there's a couple of hard drives in there. Like, like it's not-
[2379.58 --> 2380.58]  Hard drives out up fast, hey?
[2380.58 --> 2387.58]  That's why I mentioned it. They have real quick. Like even something like a node 304 or an array R2. I remember I loaded up an array R2, which is-
[2387.58 --> 2388.58]  Yeah.
[2388.58 --> 2394.58]  Their older six drive ITX chassis. And I put six hard drives in it. I was like, oh!
[2394.58 --> 2396.58]  Yeah, yeah. It gets pretty beefy pretty quick.
[2396.58 --> 2397.58]  Yeah.
[2397.58 --> 2401.58]  These things are ridiculous. You should just do away with them and use only SSDs.
[2401.58 --> 2403.58]  Get right on that.
[2403.58 --> 2404.58]  That's what I do.
[2404.58 --> 2405.58]  Yeah.
[2405.58 --> 2406.58]  Popping geek tags again.
[2406.58 --> 2410.58]  Yeah, exactly. Popping geek tags. No thrift shop for Linus, you know.
[2410.58 --> 2421.58]  I'm a bit disappointed with Sony's big controller redesign. Okay. Should have replaced the D-pad with a rubber touch pad. Ooh, I don't know about that. Here's, oh, here's a controversial one. Is this-
[2421.58 --> 2427.58]  Calling out. Yeah. Was Biohazard better than Voodoo PC? So here's the deal.
[2427.58 --> 2428.58]  Raul might be watching. Yeah.
[2428.58 --> 2430.58]  He's actually a big Linus Tech Tips fan.
[2430.58 --> 2436.58]  Yeah, and I know Raul, so if you are, hey Raul, what's up? Not better, different. So that sounds like-
[2436.58 --> 2437.58]  Oh, come on.
[2437.58 --> 2438.58]  No, but listen.
[2438.58 --> 2439.58]  Don't cop out on this one.
[2439.58 --> 2442.58]  You have to be this tall to give me crap, okay? So here's the thing.
[2442.58 --> 2443.58]  I'm that tall.
[2443.58 --> 2444.58]  Okay.
[2444.58 --> 2445.58]  You want me to see that?
[2445.58 --> 2446.58]  No.
[2446.58 --> 2455.58]  But yeah, so here's the thing. You know, back when I was doing it, it was actually awesome. Like, there was mutual respect between all of the high-end boutique guys.
[2455.58 --> 2462.58]  Whether it was Raul at Voodoo, Kelt at Falcon, Wallace at Main Gear, Al when he was at Hypersonic, Mario when he was at Overdrive.
[2462.58 --> 2472.58]  I mean, like, we all knew each other. We'd all go to these events and hang out together. And it was kind of like, it was almost like a car club thing. Like, hey man, I wouldn't have chosen to do a Nova, but you did it pretty awesome. I'd choose to do something else.
[2472.58 --> 2479.58]  So there's always this mutual respect of like, you know, I like what you do. I just choose to do mine this way.
[2479.58 --> 2480.58]  Yeah.
[2480.58 --> 2486.58]  And then the thing is like, when new technology would come out, we'd actually talk to each other like, hey, are you planning on using this? Because I don't want to snipe it if you're using it.
[2486.58 --> 2500.58]  Or, I remember we started using like, like, like a version of like Icy Docks back in the day, like the hot swap drives. And Mario from Overdrive was using them at the time. So I called him up and like, hey dude, we have a customer that wants these. We're thinking about running with them. But I know you started using them first. Are you cool with that? And he's like, yeah, no problem. I mean, but it was the fact that I was going to do something else.
[2500.58 --> 2507.58]  Yeah, no problem. I mean, but it was the fact that like, we weren't trying to snipe each other. It wasn't this cutthroat industry. It was just like, you know, like a guy's club.
[2507.58 --> 2509.58]  The car show was a good analogy.
[2509.58 --> 2513.58]  Yeah. Yeah. It's like we have mutual respect. Maybe I wouldn't have gone with that one, but you know, more power to you.
[2513.58 --> 2514.58]  Yeah.
[2514.58 --> 2522.58]  So that's the answer. It was just different. You know, we went more with like a hardcore cooling stance. And like, you know, Kelto always had like really awesome paint jobs at Falcon.
[2522.58 --> 2523.58]  Yeah.
[2523.58 --> 2529.58]  He had some really sick stuff there. We did some of that, but you know, I think everybody has to a certain degree, but we each kind of had our niche and that's what we focused on.
[2529.58 --> 2531.58]  Whereas Voodoo had the gold plated case.
[2531.58 --> 2536.58]  Yeah. Yeah. See, yes. I remember he had the picture of the white glows, getting it out. I actually saw that at CPU magazine.
[2536.58 --> 2541.58]  I was out there taking one of our systems out and they had it set up there doing a photo shoot of it.
[2541.58 --> 2548.58]  And the one thing that Raul always did really well was like the divider plate in the Lian Li case that he used was polished like so perfectly.
[2548.58 --> 2551.58]  Oh, I know. It looked like a mirror. I'm like, he's got two motherboards in there. What? Oh, that's a reflection.
[2551.58 --> 2555.58]  That looks so good. And then he had the lighting on the bottom.
[2555.58 --> 2558.58]  Yeah. Yep. And then he had like the front etched out with, you know, like the tiki.
[2558.58 --> 2559.58]  The laser cut thing. Yep.
[2559.58 --> 2564.58]  Yeah. So no, it was awesome. But yeah, I mean, like I've known Raul for years and, you know, we all still stay in touch.
[2564.58 --> 2569.58]  At last CES, we ran into Wallace and the guys from Ingear. So it's, it's just a respect thing. So.
[2569.58 --> 2574.58]  How much did he charge for the gold plated case? Was it 10 grand or 25 grand? I can't remember.
[2574.58 --> 2575.58]  Oh, there's more than that. I think.
[2575.58 --> 2576.58]  Was it 25?
[2576.58 --> 2578.58]  It was up there. Yeah. I think. I can't remember.
[2578.58 --> 2582.58]  Yeah. Something along those lines. Do you know if he ever sold any?
[2582.58 --> 2588.58]  I believe he did like a one off. Like I know at least one of them was like a one off for like some Prince in Dubai or something.
[2588.58 --> 2591.58]  I can't remember. But. Yeah, I know. It's like, man.
[2591.58 --> 2593.58]  Of course it's a Prince in Dubai.
[2593.58 --> 2595.58]  Yeah. Or a guy in Jersey. One of the two. I don't know.
[2595.58 --> 2598.58]  The Dubai Prince, if you're watching, let us know if you still have your friends.
[2598.58 --> 2600.58]  Let us know if you still have your gold plated voodoo.
[2600.58 --> 2602.58]  Yeah. Or was it made of gold?
[2602.58 --> 2604.58]  No. Well, gold would be too malleable.
[2604.58 --> 2608.58]  Yeah. So it had to be plated, but still that much plating would be.
[2608.58 --> 2611.58]  And plating aluminum is not easy. Yeah.
[2611.58 --> 2616.58]  That's actually like, like a thing. Plating aluminum with gold. I tried to have, I tried to have.
[2616.58 --> 2617.58]  It's like alchemy.
[2617.58 --> 2627.58]  The, well, yeah, sort of. Oh, here these. So I have some Mushkin copperheads here that I tried to have the tops, the top pieces.
[2627.58 --> 2634.58]  Cause I thought they were brass. Yeah. So I tried to have these gold plated to go along with my gold plated apogee HD water block.
[2634.58 --> 2638.58]  And they told me when we thought it was. Popping nerd tags again. Just popping nerd tags. But go for it.
[2638.58 --> 2642.58]  When we thought it was, when we thought it was brass, it was going to be no problem.
[2642.58 --> 2647.58]  But as soon as they found out it was aluminum, they said actually it's much more challenging and much more of a problem.
[2647.58 --> 2650.58]  Yeah. I'm sure it'd be like a more chemical process. Yeah.
[2650.58 --> 2653.58]  Yeah. Involving like chemists.
[2653.58 --> 2654.58]  Stuff that we don't know.
[2654.58 --> 2656.58]  Stuff that we don't understand at all.
[2656.58 --> 2660.58]  So actually going back to our topic with multi-core gaming a little bit.
[2660.58 --> 2664.58]  So Crysis 3, the rumor on the street, and we've actually done some testing.
[2664.58 --> 2666.58]  I'll probably let you talk about that a little bit.
[2666.58 --> 2674.58]  Crysis 3, the rumor is, runs better on AMD 830, 8350 FX versus the 3570K.
[2674.58 --> 2677.58]  Remember these are equivalently priced processors.
[2677.58 --> 2683.58]  The difference being that the 3570K is cut down and does not have hyper threading compared to the 3770K.
[2683.58 --> 2688.58]  And the 8350 is AMD's flagship FX series processor and has eight physical cores.
[2688.58 --> 2697.58]  Well, like sort of like four plus half of four kind of, you know, bulldozer modules.
[2697.58 --> 2702.58]  Four bulldozer modules, which are each sort of one and a half actual physical cores.
[2702.58 --> 2706.58]  So, Slick, are you, are you ready to...
[2706.58 --> 2708.58]  I don't remember my actual numbers.
[2708.58 --> 2709.58]  You don't remember the actual numbers.
[2709.58 --> 2710.58]  Okay.
[2710.58 --> 2711.58]  I'm not looking at my numbers.
[2711.58 --> 2713.58]  Well, at any rate, we actually did test these.
[2713.58 --> 2716.58]  We ran them with a GeForce GTX Titan.
[2716.58 --> 2717.58]  Wait, no we didn't.
[2717.58 --> 2719.58]  We ran them with the 660 Ti, right?
[2719.58 --> 2722.58]  With the Titan, it was 8350 versus 3770K.
[2722.58 --> 2723.58]  Ah, that's right.
[2723.58 --> 2724.58]  Okay.
[2724.58 --> 2727.58]  So with the Titan, we ran 3770K versus 8350.
[2727.58 --> 2730.58]  So that's the hyper threaded one versus the 8350.
[2730.58 --> 2733.58]  And the 3770K kind of ran away with that one, right?
[2733.58 --> 2734.58]  Yes.
[2734.58 --> 2739.58]  So in that case, it looks like a Crysis 3 is heavily multicore optimized.
[2739.58 --> 2745.58]  But when we tried 3570K versus 8350 with a GTX 660 Ti, which is a much more reasonable
[2745.58 --> 2747.58]  class of video card that many more gamers are running.
[2747.58 --> 2752.58]  I mean, Titans cost a thousand bucks, which I guess means nothing to you, Mr. $8,000 computers
[2752.58 --> 2753.58]  and all that.
[2753.58 --> 2755.58]  Yeah, I've got three of them sitting on the dashboard of my car right now.
[2755.58 --> 2756.58]  Yeah.
[2756.58 --> 2757.58]  Just make it rain.
[2757.58 --> 2758.58]  Yeah.
[2758.58 --> 2759.58]  Make it rain, make it rain Titans up in here.
[2759.58 --> 2760.58]  Yeah.
[2760.58 --> 2761.58]  Yeah.
[2761.58 --> 2765.58]  So running with a much more realistic card, we actually ran into a situation where, what
[2765.58 --> 2766.58]  were the numbers?
[2766.58 --> 2767.58]  The averages are very similar.
[2767.58 --> 2768.58]  The averages were very similar.
[2768.58 --> 2772.58]  But when we hit one intensive spot, and actually in our video review, which is coming out soon,
[2772.58 --> 2777.58]  I think we said it looked like a blip, but we've rerun it since then and validated it.
[2777.58 --> 2783.58]  As the physics effects go crazy, the Intel CPU actually got less bogged down than the AMD CPU.
[2783.58 --> 2789.58]  So what it looks like to us is there was an event in the game that wasn't threaded, and that's
[2789.58 --> 2791.58]  where the Intel CPU was able to pull ahead.
[2791.58 --> 2796.58]  So our minimum frames per second dipped when, what are you doing in that spot?
[2796.58 --> 2799.58]  So, for anyone who's seen the benchmarking guide, if you haven't, this will hopefully
[2799.58 --> 2803.58]  describe it enough, we go from a very calm, literally just walking through a tunnel part
[2803.58 --> 2806.58]  of the benchmark to the action part of the benchmark.
[2806.58 --> 2811.58]  And I come up to the top of stairs, pull both explosive arrows, and just start hammering
[2811.58 --> 2812.58]  at a turret.
[2812.58 --> 2813.58]  So there's three or four guys.
[2813.58 --> 2814.58]  How do you hammer with a bow and arrow?
[2814.58 --> 2815.58]  Oh my god.
[2815.58 --> 2817.58]  There's three or four guys shooting at me.
[2817.58 --> 2818.58]  He's stupid.
[2818.58 --> 2819.58]  There's a turret going off.
[2819.58 --> 2822.58]  I'm blowing the turret up with explosive arrows.
[2822.58 --> 2826.58]  I'm moving quickly all at the same time, and you can always feel the whole computer gets
[2826.58 --> 2830.58]  really sluggish right when that happens on almost every platform I've ran it on.
[2830.58 --> 2832.58]  Okay, Slick, I have two choices for you.
[2832.58 --> 2833.58]  Oh my god.
[2833.58 --> 2836.58]  Which of these is more appropriate for hammering something?
[2836.58 --> 2840.58]  No, no, you clearly don't know that because, sorry, what did you say before?
[2840.58 --> 2843.58]  Hold on, let's see if Josh can figure this out.
[2843.58 --> 2845.58]  Josh, which is more appropriate?
[2845.58 --> 2846.58]  For hammering?
[2846.58 --> 2847.58]  For hammering, yes.
[2847.58 --> 2848.58]  A turret.
[2848.58 --> 2849.58]  Yes, hammering a turret.
[2849.58 --> 2851.58]  Hammering a turret.
[2851.58 --> 2854.58]  I would still have to go with probably the hammer.
[2854.58 --> 2855.58]  Okay, you're both wrong.
[2855.58 --> 2857.58]  You have a bow and arrow?
[2857.58 --> 2858.58]  Because the only-
[2858.58 --> 2860.58]  But a bow and arrow still has a striking motion.
[2860.58 --> 2861.58]  Nope, you're both wrong.
[2861.58 --> 2862.58]  A saw does not have a striking motion.
[2862.58 --> 2866.58]  Because this is the only tool appropriate for hammering a turret.
[2866.58 --> 2867.58]  You could still hammer with that.
[2867.58 --> 2868.58]  Hold on, ten points, ten points.
[2868.58 --> 2869.58]  What am I referring to?
[2869.58 --> 2873.58]  What do hammer turrets with wrenches?
[2873.58 --> 2874.58]  Oh, no.
[2874.58 --> 2876.58]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[2876.58 --> 2877.58]  Did you ever play Team Fortress 2?
[2877.58 --> 2878.58]  No.
[2878.58 --> 2879.58]  Oh, that's disappointing.
[2879.58 --> 2881.58]  That was a lot of lead up to-
[2881.58 --> 2885.58]  That was a huge amount of lead up for one not the greatest point.
[2885.58 --> 2887.58]  Yeah, that joke fell kind of flat, didn't it?
[2887.58 --> 2889.58]  But you invested a lot of time in it though.
[2889.58 --> 2890.58]  Yeah.
[2890.58 --> 2891.58]  A for effort.
[2891.58 --> 2892.58]  Thank you.
[2892.58 --> 2894.58]  A for effort with biohazard.
[2894.58 --> 2895.58]  Sorry, are they still in business?
[2895.58 --> 2898.58]  Oh, man, you just got to keep digging on me like that, don't you?
[2898.58 --> 2900.58]  Oh, I see how it is.
[2900.58 --> 2902.58]  It's going to get real in here pretty quick.
[2902.58 --> 2905.58]  Sorry, were you done?
[2905.58 --> 2907.58]  I don't even know.
[2907.58 --> 2909.58]  Oh, yeah, you were hammering on the turret and then-
[2909.58 --> 2911.58]  I'm pretty sure I finished while you were being annoying.
[2911.58 --> 2912.58]  Oh, okay, cool.
[2912.58 --> 2914.58]  Which is a long period of time.
[2914.58 --> 2917.58]  Yeah, that could have happened at any point.
[2917.58 --> 2921.58]  Okay, so you know what?
[2921.58 --> 2924.58]  I'm going to go back to that forum thread called questions for Josh
[2924.58 --> 2927.58]  and see if we can find any other good fractal design questions
[2927.58 --> 2928.58]  because I think we've-
[2928.58 --> 2933.58]  Some guys from Mexico wants to know how the heck he can buy a fractal design case.
[2933.58 --> 2939.58]  Book a flight to the US and pick one up here.
[2939.58 --> 2942.58]  No, we are officially not in Mexico.
[2942.58 --> 2946.58]  Although we will get tech support calls from Mexico so it can be done.
[2946.58 --> 2949.58]  I mean, you know, like, okay, how'd you get that?
[2949.58 --> 2952.58]  Okay, well, anyway, here's what you do to fix this, fix that.
[2952.58 --> 2956.58]  But, yeah, so we're always looking at new markets.
[2956.58 --> 2957.58]  I'll put it that way.
[2957.58 --> 2958.58]  There's a great question.
[2958.58 --> 2959.58]  What are the complications?
[2959.58 --> 2965.58]  Because, I mean, from the layman's perspective, it's as simple as, oh, find a store there,
[2965.58 --> 2968.58]  ship them a bunch of cases, and then they sell them.
[2968.58 --> 2969.58]  What are the complications?
[2969.58 --> 2970.58]  That's all we got to do?
[2970.58 --> 2971.58]  Yeah, I know, right?
[2971.58 --> 2972.58]  Should have done that.
[2972.58 --> 2977.58]  So, honestly, a large part of it comes into, like, import tax.
[2977.58 --> 2980.58]  You know, you have to validate any market that you want to move into,
[2980.58 --> 2983.58]  make sure there's a customer base there, and that it's sustainable.
[2983.58 --> 2988.58]  Certain countries will have, like, a 300% import tax on...
[2988.58 --> 2990.58]  That's common in South America, correct?
[2990.58 --> 2991.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[2991.58 --> 2996.58]  And then so it's like, okay, now all of a sudden your case is three times what it was in the States,
[2996.58 --> 3001.58]  which is okay as long as everybody else's case is three times what it was, you know,
[3001.58 --> 3002.58]  because then people are used to paying that.
[3002.58 --> 3006.58]  But then if there's, like, say, a local manufacturer where they don't have the importation,
[3006.58 --> 3008.58]  then there's no way you can possibly compete.
[3008.58 --> 3015.58]  Or if it's a market like South America where it's dominated by low-end parts because everything's so expensive.
[3015.58 --> 3019.58]  You know, it's funny because people often, I get messages all the time,
[3019.58 --> 3022.58]  why are NCIX's prices so low?
[3022.58 --> 3024.58]  They're so low compared to in my country.
[3024.58 --> 3027.58]  I wish NCIX could sell to me here, to which I would reply, well, they could,
[3027.58 --> 3033.58]  but you're just going to pay it on the tax on the receipt rather than to the retailer itself.
[3033.58 --> 3038.58]  And I mean, Europeans often look at the prices on NCIX and go, oh, the prices are so low.
[3038.58 --> 3039.58]  Because you don't have VAT over here and stuff like that.
[3039.58 --> 3041.58]  Because we don't have a value-add tax.
[3041.58 --> 3043.58]  That's what it's called, right? Value-add tax or something like that.
[3043.58 --> 3044.58]  I believe so.
[3044.58 --> 3045.58]  And then, you know, shipping too, right?
[3045.58 --> 3047.58]  It's like, okay, yeah, it's like the price is cheap.
[3047.58 --> 3048.58]  They're going to pay just that much in shipping.
[3048.58 --> 3049.58]  That's right.
[3049.58 --> 3050.58]  You get it there.
[3050.58 --> 3051.58]  And then, you know, then you have import duties too.
[3051.58 --> 3053.58]  It's like, can you please ship it to me?
[3053.58 --> 3054.58]  Market as gift.
[3054.58 --> 3055.58]  Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
[3055.58 --> 3056.58]  Business can't do that.
[3056.58 --> 3057.58]  Yeah, yeah, that's a big problem.
[3057.58 --> 3061.58]  Well, another thing is there's, you know, there's different desires in different regions.
[3061.58 --> 3069.58]  I mean, if you look at probably, you know, some of the most popular cases in the US are not always the most popular versions in Europe or other parts of the world.
[3069.58 --> 3072.58]  So there's definitely different tastes in different regions and things like that.
[3072.58 --> 3082.58]  I remember there was a big disparity back when you were telling me that ArcMidi was way more popular than one of the other cases that NCIX was outselling ArcMidi with 5 to 1.
[3082.58 --> 3088.58]  And I mean, that is something where you can have a difference like that across a border like US-Canada.
[3088.58 --> 3089.58]  Yeah.
[3089.58 --> 3092.58]  Where the, I mean, the needs are pretty similar.
[3092.58 --> 3096.58]  I mean, tell, okay, here, tell me the weirdest one that you've seen.
[3096.58 --> 3103.58]  Like a territory that for some reason has a huge appetite for a particular case that's not popular somewhere else or less popular.
[3103.58 --> 3108.58]  Um, like we've had, you know, I guess I don't want to call it any specific regions because they're all different.
[3108.58 --> 3116.58]  I'm not sure if I remember correctly, but there's one of the European regions where it's like, for example, the Core 1000 was doing okay.
[3116.58 --> 3119.58]  And then like the Define XL, like they just didn't like it.
[3119.58 --> 3122.58]  And then like over here, the Define XL had always been like one of our top four cases.
[3122.58 --> 3125.58]  And like the sales figures, it was just like staggering.
[3125.58 --> 3132.58]  It's like, you would think that just by like, you know, normal aggregate sales, you'd get more than what you're getting on that one.
[3132.58 --> 3134.58]  But then, you know, they'd have another case that here did okay.
[3134.58 --> 3137.58]  And over there, it was just like, you couldn't find them on the shell there.
[3137.58 --> 3138.58]  They were gone so quick.
[3138.58 --> 3139.58]  So.
[3139.58 --> 3146.58]  It's interesting how different brand choices and even individual, like not within brands, different choices that happen.
[3146.58 --> 3150.58]  It just region to region, especially on forums, you'll find like, oh, wow.
[3150.58 --> 3156.58]  People in say Germany, like this, like crazy silence optimized case that just doesn't really sell in North America.
[3156.58 --> 3163.58]  Well, you know, one of the unique things too, is just if you look at the usage habits of people in different regions, like, and a liquid coins always been very popular in Europe.
[3163.58 --> 3170.58]  Like, yeah, I mean, they have entire companies over there that I, I mean, I used to product manage water cooling at NCIX.
[3170.58 --> 3172.58]  I'd try to bring in these product lines.
[3172.58 --> 3174.58]  I couldn't sell a single unit.
[3174.58 --> 3175.58]  I'd have to give them away.
[3175.58 --> 3176.58]  I'd have to sell them at a loss.
[3176.58 --> 3179.58]  And yet these are huge companies in Europe selling tons of gear.
[3179.58 --> 3180.58]  Yeah.
[3180.58 --> 3183.58]  And usually it's like, it's fairly expensive gear because it's pretty high end, you know, it's refined and stuff over there.
[3183.58 --> 3185.58]  And it's manufactured in Europe a lot of the time as well.
[3185.58 --> 3186.58]  Yeah.
[3186.58 --> 3187.58]  Which is even more costly.
[3187.58 --> 3188.58]  Yeah.
[3188.58 --> 3189.58]  Yeah.
[3189.58 --> 3194.58]  You know, so what you look at is, is you see that and you see it's like, it's a different culture, at least as far as the usage scenario goes.
[3194.58 --> 3198.58]  So you have guys that like their whole thing is setting up a custom liquid cooling loop.
[3198.58 --> 3203.58]  And then like in the States it's popular, but it seems like it's not as popular to go the full custom loop route.
[3203.58 --> 3207.58]  I think that's why you see like the self-contained liquid coolers are really popular.
[3207.58 --> 3208.58]  A lot of H100s.
[3208.58 --> 3209.58]  Yeah.
[3209.58 --> 3213.58]  Because the thing is, it's like at the end of the day, it's like, you can set up this really, you know, awesome liquid cooling loop.
[3213.58 --> 3218.58]  And then you fire up the pump, start priming the tubes and everything, and then drip, drip, drip.
[3218.58 --> 3221.58]  So then you got to go and try and tighten everything down and it's...
[3221.58 --> 3222.58]  You must not be very good at water cooling.
[3222.58 --> 3223.58]  No, I'm not.
[3223.58 --> 3225.58]  I didn't even have a business that I was good at.
[3225.58 --> 3229.58]  But you know, it's like, so you know, the thing is like, you'll do that or it's like, you know, you go to do a computer upgrade, right?
[3229.58 --> 3235.58]  It's like, you know, cause usually if you tend to be a liquid cooling guy, you're kind of like an early adopter or at least you're into tech.
[3235.58 --> 3239.58]  And it's like, I'm going to cool liquid card for the next four months.
[3239.58 --> 3249.58]  And then the best part is when you get that new card and it ends up having some kind of an issue and then you end up wanting to swap to the red or the green team solution.
[3249.58 --> 3250.58]  Yep.
[3250.58 --> 3253.58]  And so you actually end up changing it more often than every upgrade cycle.
[3253.58 --> 3254.58]  Oh crap.
[3254.58 --> 3255.58]  Well, one card wasn't good enough.
[3255.58 --> 3256.58]  I need two.
[3256.58 --> 3258.58]  So I guess I better drain and redo the whole thing.
[3258.58 --> 3271.58]  I mean, honestly, part of the reason that my personal rig has taken so long is that everything I do is not like where I put my cutouts in the motherboard tray is not based on the motherboard I'm using now.
[3271.58 --> 3278.58]  It's based on what could I possibly foresee happening such that I wouldn't have to redo this.
[3278.58 --> 3283.58]  By the time you're done, it's going to be a bunch of zip ties holding the motherboard up because you're going to Swiss cheese your motherboard tray.
[3283.58 --> 3285.58]  It's got no rigidity.
[3285.58 --> 3287.58]  Do not look at the case too hard.
[3287.58 --> 3288.58]  Yeah.
[3288.58 --> 3292.58]  Well, no, what I'm hoping is that the motherboard will actually support the motherboard tray.
[3292.58 --> 3293.58]  It's a balancing act.
[3293.58 --> 3295.58]  Do not breathe on the system.
[3295.58 --> 3298.58]  A really good question.
[3298.58 --> 3306.58]  Will the sound dampening on an R4 adequately block the high pitched sound frequency of a D5 pump on setting five?
[3306.58 --> 3307.58]  Okay.
[3307.58 --> 3309.58]  So that's a very specific question.
[3309.58 --> 3310.58]  Yeah.
[3310.58 --> 3311.58]  Yeah.
[3311.58 --> 3312.58]  It depends.
[3312.58 --> 3314.58]  It depends on placement.
[3314.58 --> 3319.58]  So I met with Mike Chen from Silent PC Review this morning.
[3319.58 --> 3320.58]  We were talking.
[3320.58 --> 3327.58]  Well, basically he was talking and I was just sitting there slack jawed trying to understand all the stuff that he was spouting about, you know, sound waves and things like that, because that's where he's very good.
[3327.58 --> 3337.58]  But, um, yeah, it generally what you're looking at when you come from like a sound deadening principle and kind of the way we do what we do is.
[3337.58 --> 3342.58]  Um, there's like echo canceling and then there's like sound deadening.
[3342.58 --> 3346.58]  Like when you see like the soft eggshell foam, like inside recording studios.
[3346.58 --> 3347.58]  Yeah.
[3347.58 --> 3348.58]  That's not sound deadening.
[3348.58 --> 3350.58]  That's designed to like mitigate echoing.
[3350.58 --> 3351.58]  Disperse sound.
[3351.58 --> 3352.58]  Yeah.
[3352.58 --> 3354.58]  So like I saw a blog where they explained it very well.
[3354.58 --> 3359.58]  Where it's basically like if you went to like a racquetball court, you know, hard walls everywhere, take like a handful like high bounce balls and just chuck them.
[3359.58 --> 3361.58]  They're going to bounce around forever.
[3361.58 --> 3362.58]  Right?
[3362.58 --> 3365.58]  Now, if you go put like that foam on the wall, you know, they're going to hit it, boom and drop.
[3365.58 --> 3367.58]  So same sort of thing with sound waves.
[3367.58 --> 3371.58]  Now, if like you want to sound dead in something that usually comes in like wall construction, thickness, things like that.
[3371.58 --> 3377.58]  So, you know, if you just had a standard drywall with that eggshell crepe foam on one side and your buddies on the outside.
[3377.58 --> 3378.58]  That's nothing.
[3378.58 --> 3379.58]  Yeah.
[3379.58 --> 3380.58]  Does nothing.
[3380.58 --> 3381.58]  It's not going to stop it.
[3381.58 --> 3382.58]  Plus it's more porous.
[3382.58 --> 3384.58]  It's, it has like a narrow band of what it will stop.
[3384.58 --> 3385.58]  Can be flammable.
[3385.58 --> 3386.58]  Could be.
[3386.58 --> 3387.58]  Yeah.
[3387.58 --> 3390.58]  And then the, the, the good stuff is, and what we have in here probably is.
[3390.58 --> 3391.58]  Yeah.
[3391.58 --> 3394.58]  I'm starting to feel real safe right about now, but you know, so then when it comes to
[3394.58 --> 3398.58]  actually sound deadening, like if you're, again, if you're looking at room analogy, that
[3398.58 --> 3401.58]  comes into like the construction of the wall itself, how thick the wall is, how thick the
[3401.58 --> 3402.58]  materials are.
[3402.58 --> 3406.58]  And then you could still have it sound deadened, but the inside of the room would be very echoey.
[3406.58 --> 3407.58]  Yeah.
[3407.58 --> 3411.58]  So where that comes back into case design is our material is more dense, our bitumen.
[3411.58 --> 3413.58]  So it's designed much more at.
[3413.58 --> 3414.58]  Deadening.
[3414.58 --> 3415.58]  Towards sound deadening.
[3415.58 --> 3419.58]  And then it also has to do with, you know, mitigating vibration on the actual panel itself.
[3419.58 --> 3424.58]  Because what you see a lot of times is it's like, you might not be hearing the sound you're
[3424.58 --> 3426.58]  hearing, you know, the remnants of the sound echoing through the panel.
[3426.58 --> 3428.58]  That's where like good panel fits come in.
[3428.58 --> 3433.58]  So as far as the pump goes, um, high pitch stuff is kind of harder to grab.
[3433.58 --> 3438.58]  That's why my voice tends to get picked up by the mic better than either of theirs, because
[3438.58 --> 3442.58]  my voice carries, cause it's, uh, not quite as deep and manly.
[3442.58 --> 3443.58]  See, I can't even fake it.
[3443.58 --> 3444.58]  Yeah.
[3444.58 --> 3445.58]  Your voice cracked.
[3445.58 --> 3446.58]  It's not as deep and manly.
[3446.58 --> 3447.58]  Why?
[3447.58 --> 3452.58]  When I was doing videos, I thought that I could get the microphone a little bit further
[3452.58 --> 3454.58]  away from me, a little bit closer to you.
[3454.58 --> 3455.58]  Okay.
[3455.58 --> 3460.58]  You'd have like lapel mics like, well, Linus, you know, the problem actually is very white
[3460.58 --> 3461.58]  on it.
[3461.58 --> 3464.58]  Um, so yeah, it's hard to stop that high frequency sound.
[3464.58 --> 3469.58]  And also, I mean, this is one of the things that I tell people over and over again, get
[3469.58 --> 3474.58]  a silent case all you want, but don't imagine that you can buy a silent case.
[3474.58 --> 3476.58]  You like how I've had that little comment there for a little while?
[3476.58 --> 3477.58]  You like that?
[3477.58 --> 3478.58]  Yeah.
[3478.58 --> 3482.58]  I, uh, I'll put that away.
[3482.58 --> 3483.58]  Okay.
[3483.58 --> 3485.58]  Don't imagine you're going to buy a Define R4.
[3485.58 --> 3489.58]  You're going to put Delta fans in it and it's going to be a quiet system.
[3489.58 --> 3494.58]  Your system is as quiet as the quietest component or as the loudest component you have in it.
[3494.58 --> 3495.58]  Okay.
[3495.58 --> 3496.58]  So wrap your mind around that.
[3496.58 --> 3499.58]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no perfected the black hole case.
[3499.58 --> 3500.58]  Yes.
[3500.58 --> 3501.58]  It's just a complete vacuum.
[3501.58 --> 3505.58]  I mean, it is, it's a product of its environment and what it's designed to do is mitigate noise
[3505.58 --> 3506.58]  as much as possible.
[3506.58 --> 3510.58]  But obviously if you put in a much higher noise source, it can only mitigate that so much.
[3510.58 --> 3513.58]  And I've had people message me, Oh, I bought a silent case.
[3513.58 --> 3518.58]  I bought a, you know, NZXT H2, which is very different from the Define series.
[3518.58 --> 3523.58]  And I put, uh, I, I took out all of the, do they have, do they have events and theirs as well?
[3523.58 --> 3524.58]  I can't remember.
[3524.58 --> 3525.58]  Okay.
[3525.58 --> 3526.58]  Let's go with Ninoxia then.
[3526.58 --> 3528.58]  So then that Ninoxia case.
[3528.58 --> 3534.58]  So I, I opened up all of the, uh, I opened up all the vents and I put these high performance
[3534.58 --> 3536.58]  fans, I'm getting great temps, but it isn't very quiet.
[3536.58 --> 3539.58]  It's all about using the thing the way it's supposed to be used.
[3539.58 --> 3544.58]  You buy a Define R4, you put some sweet ass Noctua fans in there.
[3544.58 --> 3547.58]  You put a nice silent cooler, you get like a nice quiet GPU.
[3547.58 --> 3549.58]  You're going to have a quiet computer.
[3549.58 --> 3553.58]  Well, yeah, generally your, your biggest sources of noise are going to be hard drives, graphics
[3553.58 --> 3556.58]  card, and then obviously fans, you know, and that's why we had the Modj event.
[3556.58 --> 3559.58]  So it's like, you know, if you're not using that, you're at least blocking off one area
[3559.58 --> 3560.58]  where the sound can get out.
[3560.58 --> 3565.58]  And there's, there's always got to be a design principle trade off where you have to have
[3565.58 --> 3567.58]  airflow and then you have to have some sound.
[3567.58 --> 3570.58]  And it's like, yeah, if you were going to make basically a box and weld it shut.
[3570.58 --> 3571.58]  Okay.
[3571.58 --> 3574.58]  That's gonna be like the most silent case you're going to have, but then, you know, airflow tends
[3574.58 --> 3576.58]  to suffer a little bit when you can't breathe.
[3576.58 --> 3578.58]  So, yeah, there's a lot of things that go into the design of it.
[3578.58 --> 3581.58]  Not that we've, I guess, necessarily pioneered it.
[3581.58 --> 3586.58]  Not that it's exclusive IP, but there's just things where if you look at the layout of a
[3586.58 --> 3588.58]  case, you can kind of understand what we're doing and why we're doing it.
[3588.58 --> 3593.58]  The other thing to be aware of is that the D5, unless you're running like six water blocks
[3593.58 --> 3597.58]  in it, anywhere from one to five, you're looking at maybe a one degree difference.
[3597.58 --> 3598.58]  You stole my point.
[3598.58 --> 3599.58]  Well, here's another thing.
[3599.58 --> 3603.58]  I'll steal, you know, maybe another point, but when, back when we were in liquid cooling,
[3603.58 --> 3604.58]  We're leaving no points for you.
[3604.58 --> 3605.58]  There's no points.
[3605.58 --> 3606.58]  There's zero points.
[3606.58 --> 3609.58]  You know, the other thing I've heard a lot about with liquid cooling is like, oh, where
[3609.58 --> 3610.58]  do you place your radiator?
[3610.58 --> 3613.58]  You know, cause I want my radiator right in front of my outlet to my, my CPU.
[3613.58 --> 3614.58]  So my CPU gets coolest water.
[3614.58 --> 3616.58]  It's like, that's not how it works.
[3616.58 --> 3621.58]  Uh, you know, with people that I dealt with in the industry, it's basically the loop on a liquid
[3621.58 --> 3624.58]  cooling system is so short and it moves so fast.
[3624.58 --> 3627.58]  Your radiator basically just brings down the overall temperature of the loop.
[3627.58 --> 3628.58]  Yeah.
[3628.58 --> 3632.58]  So it's like, maybe it goes into the radiator at like 40 degrees and comes out at like 39.9998.
[3632.58 --> 3634.58]  It's actually higher than that.
[3634.58 --> 3635.58]  Yeah.
[3635.58 --> 3637.58]  I've seen as much as about half of a degree.
[3637.58 --> 3638.58]  Okay.
[3638.58 --> 3639.58]  But again, 0.75 of a degree.
[3639.58 --> 3641.58]  And then we're talking about benchmark numbers, right?
[3641.58 --> 3645.58]  You know, it's like, okay, it's the difference between like, okay, driving a Ferrari that has
[3645.58 --> 3646.58]  400 horsepower and 450.
[3646.58 --> 3648.58]  It's like on the street, are you going to be able to tell difference?
[3648.58 --> 3649.58]  Probably not on a dyno.
[3649.58 --> 3650.58]  Yes.
[3650.58 --> 3651.58]  But are you going to drive it on a dyno?
[3651.58 --> 3652.58]  Are you going to drive it on the street?
[3652.58 --> 3654.58]  So you got to look like the real world application of what you're doing.
[3654.58 --> 3657.58]  If I had a Ferrari, I'd do nothing but dyno it.
[3657.58 --> 3659.58]  And I wish I had a color to pop right now.
[3659.58 --> 3660.58]  That sort of works, right?
[3660.58 --> 3661.58]  Like the hood.
[3661.58 --> 3663.58]  Just build a dyno in your own garage.
[3663.58 --> 3665.58]  So you don't even have to like go out.
[3665.58 --> 3666.58]  Just be like, sup.
[3666.58 --> 3667.58]  Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
[3667.58 --> 3668.58]  But you totally nerd it out though.
[3668.58 --> 3671.58]  You'd have like a five to one, you know, portrait display in front.
[3671.58 --> 3672.58]  It's like I'm driving.
[3672.58 --> 3673.58]  Why is there a road out there?
[3673.58 --> 3675.58]  Yeah, but the graphics are so real in here.
[3675.58 --> 3676.58]  It's so awesome.
[3676.58 --> 3677.58]  Kaboosh!
[3677.58 --> 3678.58]  You physics!
[3678.58 --> 3679.58]  Yeah.
[3679.58 --> 3681.58]  Okay then.
[3681.58 --> 3687.58]  There's a lot of questions here in the thread about future upcoming Fractal Design products.
[3687.58 --> 3691.58]  I'm not even asking Josh because I know he can't answer those questions.
[3691.58 --> 3693.58]  Is there a new Define Mini?
[3693.58 --> 3694.58]  How is this Q&A?
[3694.58 --> 3695.58]  Oh, here's a good one.
[3695.58 --> 3696.58]  How is this Q&A possible?
[3696.58 --> 3702.58]  Is Josh Linus' friend and doing it as a friend or is he just representing Fractal Design?
[3702.58 --> 3704.58]  Representing poppin' tags.
[3704.58 --> 3705.58]  So, are we friends?
[3705.58 --> 3706.58]  I don't know.
[3706.58 --> 3707.58]  You're not very nice to me.
[3707.58 --> 3709.58]  Oh yeah, because you started it.
[3709.58 --> 3710.58]  Geez.
[3710.58 --> 3712.58]  No, yeah, we've known each other for a while.
[3712.58 --> 3714.58]  Much to each other's chagrin, I would say.
[3714.58 --> 3717.58]  And I guess, yes, I'm representing Fractal.
[3717.58 --> 3718.58]  Although I should do like the disclaimer.
[3718.58 --> 3720.58]  All thoughts and ideas are my own.
[3720.58 --> 3721.58]  Except for the ones I stole.
[3721.58 --> 3723.58]  So, I'm representing me.
[3723.58 --> 3724.58]  That's what I'm doing.
[3724.58 --> 3728.58]  Here's a question from Emikrian.
[3728.58 --> 3730.58]  When will you guys update the Prodigy?
[3730.58 --> 3731.58]  Let me think about it.
[3731.58 --> 3736.58]  It's going to be a little bit yet, but you know, we'll work on it.
[3736.58 --> 3737.58]  All right.
[3737.58 --> 3738.58]  You know what?
[3738.58 --> 3742.58]  Why don't we take some, let's take some Twitter questions for a second.
[3742.58 --> 3743.58]  Question for Josh.
[3743.58 --> 3746.58]  Why don't you guys have Southeast Asian branch selling via distributors?
[3746.58 --> 3748.58]  It's very irritating due to markups.
[3748.58 --> 3749.58]  You know what?
[3749.58 --> 3751.58]  I think that pretty much happens everywhere.
[3751.58 --> 3755.58]  Distributors exist because they distribute things and they-
[3755.58 --> 3759.58]  Because it's not financially feasible for everybody to have direct operations set up.
[3759.58 --> 3760.58]  Yeah.
[3760.58 --> 3765.58]  And distributors need to mark things up so that they don't, so that their babies don't starve.
[3765.58 --> 3766.58]  Okay.
[3766.58 --> 3767.58]  Wow.
[3767.58 --> 3770.58]  No, we're going to put that away for now.
[3770.58 --> 3771.58]  With the personal rig one?
[3771.58 --> 3772.58]  Yeah.
[3772.58 --> 3773.58]  Huh?
[3773.58 --> 3774.58]  What?
[3774.58 --> 3775.58]  Okay.
[3775.58 --> 3776.58]  Here.
[3776.58 --> 3777.58]  You know what?
[3777.58 --> 3780.58]  I'm going to let both of you guys address this one while I work on something on my computer.
[3780.58 --> 3785.58]  How many years do you think desktop computers have before laptops or tablets basically make
[3785.58 --> 3786.58]  them a non-factor?
[3786.58 --> 3789.58]  And you guys are both hardcore gamers, so I'm sure whatever you say is going to be what
[3789.58 --> 3790.58]  they want to hear, but-
[3790.58 --> 3794.58]  Personally, I think the form factor and usability of a PC will always be there.
[3794.58 --> 3799.58]  There's always that like feeling you can use a laptop like he is right now and be cramped
[3799.58 --> 3802.58]  up and hate everything about what you're doing.
[3802.58 --> 3803.58]  Yay!
[3803.58 --> 3804.58]  Yay!
[3804.58 --> 3805.58]  It's a lean forward device.
[3805.58 --> 3806.58]  Yeah, it's like, yeah.
[3806.58 --> 3811.58]  Then you can go and sit on your desktop and have your full nice feeling hopefully mechanical keyboard.
[3811.58 --> 3813.58]  I'm sorry, does your desktop fit in my lap?
[3813.58 --> 3814.58]  No.
[3814.58 --> 3815.58]  Because it wanted to be in my lap.
[3815.58 --> 3816.58]  That sounds like an incredibly awkward question.
[3816.58 --> 3821.58]  Is that slang for something?
[3821.58 --> 3822.58]  Oh yes.
[3822.58 --> 3823.58]  Oh my.
[3823.58 --> 3827.58]  So yeah, I think form factor will keep it there.
[3827.58 --> 3831.58]  I think the enthusiast crowd will always be there in some degree.
[3831.58 --> 3834.58]  I think it might get smaller over the years.
[3834.58 --> 3837.58]  But there will always be people that like to tinker with things.
[3837.58 --> 3838.58]  So, yeah.
[3838.58 --> 3842.58]  So I will carry that flag and that torch for you as well.
[3842.58 --> 3843.58]  So here's my thing.
[3843.58 --> 3846.58]  Like when I use my desktop, I feel like I'm at like 100% efficiency, right?
[3846.58 --> 3847.58]  Yeah.
[3847.58 --> 3849.58]  Then when I move to my laptop, I'm at like 75.
[3849.58 --> 3851.58]  Then when I move to a tablet, I'm at like 50.
[3851.58 --> 3853.58]  And on my phone, I'm at like 25.
[3853.58 --> 3858.58]  It's like, yes, I can technically thumb through an Excel spreadsheet on my Galaxy S3.
[3858.58 --> 3859.58]  Do I want to?
[3859.58 --> 3860.58]  No.
[3860.58 --> 3861.58]  No.
[3861.58 --> 3862.58]  Do I do it on my phone?
[3862.58 --> 3863.58]  When?
[3863.58 --> 3864.58]  Because I have to, right?
[3864.58 --> 3865.58]  If I'm in an airport or something.
[3865.58 --> 3870.58]  The thing is the desktop being dead, the PC being dead has been, that's been around for years.
[3870.58 --> 3871.58]  I mean, they've been saying it forever.
[3871.58 --> 3872.58]  Yeah.
[3872.58 --> 3874.58]  When you started Biohazard, was that already a thing?
[3874.58 --> 3879.58]  Oh, it was already a thing because notebooks were just going to kill the desktop.
[3879.58 --> 3880.58]  And then like netbooks came out.
[3880.58 --> 3884.58]  Netbooks were going to kill, you know, notebooks because they were smaller, more portable.
[3884.58 --> 3885.58]  I know.
[3885.58 --> 3887.58]  People didn't need high end processing power.
[3887.58 --> 3891.58]  And then tablets were going to kill the netbook, which they did.
[3891.58 --> 3894.58]  But then they were also going to kill laptops and they were going to kill.
[3894.58 --> 3895.58]  They were right.
[3895.58 --> 3896.58]  They were right.
[3896.58 --> 3897.58]  They got it right.
[3897.58 --> 3898.58]  One out of four times, 25% ain't bad, you know.
[3898.58 --> 3899.58]  But that's the thing.
[3899.58 --> 3904.58]  It's like, you know, if you look at the usage scenario, it's not so much are we going to change.
[3904.58 --> 3907.58]  It's the new market that's coming out.
[3907.58 --> 3908.58]  So my wife is a teacher.
[3908.58 --> 3913.58]  Their school went one to one where each kid has their own, you know, device.
[3913.58 --> 3914.58]  Now what's that device?
[3914.58 --> 3915.58]  It's an iPad.
[3915.58 --> 3916.58]  Why?
[3916.58 --> 3919.58]  Because Apple's ingenious about, you know, subsidizing things like that.
[3919.58 --> 3920.58]  And then what are they doing?
[3920.58 --> 3923.58]  They're creating the next generation of computer users to be Apple users.
[3923.58 --> 3926.58]  So when those kids get out of school, they're going to go with what they know.
[3926.58 --> 3932.58]  So I don't think it's so much an issue of like the three of us are going to decide desktop suck and move on.
[3932.58 --> 3937.58]  I think it's going to be the generation that comes next is just going to be used to not using one, you know.
[3937.58 --> 3941.58]  Now you're always going to have them around to a certain degree from like professional applications.
[3941.58 --> 3947.58]  I mean, like hardcore video editing, like, you know, gas modeling, all those like high end things like that.
[3947.58 --> 3948.58]  But yeah, I don't know.
[3948.58 --> 3950.58]  I mean, I don't think it's going to be dead tomorrow.
[3950.58 --> 3953.58]  But if you read it, it should have been dead for the past eight years.
[3953.58 --> 3960.58]  And it could slowly turn more into like our usage scenario might become basically gigantic docking stations.
[3960.58 --> 3967.58]  But yeah, that's because I mean, that actually brings us to the the item that we had not that long ago,
[3967.58 --> 3973.58]  because I would make the argument that unless applications get dramatically more multi threading aware,
[3973.58 --> 3978.58]  which is starting to happen finally, but they've been saying it's happening since the Athlon 64 X2 launch.
[3978.58 --> 3979.58]  Yeah.
[3979.58 --> 3985.58]  So finally happening a bit to me doesn't necessarily equate to I'm celebrating just yet.
[3985.58 --> 3988.58]  So where am I going with this?
[3988.58 --> 3989.58]  Right.
[3989.58 --> 3997.58]  I would make the argument that anything but a super slim ultra book actually has a powerful enough CPU for anything but a hardcore video editor,
[3997.58 --> 3999.58]  someone who's really, really hitting it.
[3999.58 --> 4002.58]  So like a gamer, especially as multi threading.
[4002.58 --> 4006.58]  Actually, this probably helps my point rather than hinders it as multi threading gets better.
[4006.58 --> 4011.58]  And we start seeing four, six, eight core CPUs and notebooks that maybe aren't clocked that high,
[4011.58 --> 4013.58]  but they're very power efficient and they can dissipate the heat.
[4013.58 --> 4016.58]  And maybe it's, you know, a gaming form factor notebook.
[4016.58 --> 4021.58]  Now picture this because the big issue that gamers have with notebooks is graphics cards, right?
[4021.58 --> 4022.58]  Yeah.
[4022.58 --> 4031.58]  So we had a Magma Express box 3T, which is an external Thunderbolt enclosure that runs off to three PCI Express slots.
[4031.58 --> 4040.58]  So you could, if the drivers were enabled and right now Nvidia and AMD, I think don't want to open up the poop storm that will be,
[4040.58 --> 4045.58]  if people buy these things, spend a thousand dollars on this box, plug their GPU in and it doesn't work.
[4045.58 --> 4049.58]  All of a sudden they're rewriting their driver for like that one dude.
[4049.58 --> 4050.58]  Yeah.
[4050.58 --> 4056.58]  I think they're just afraid to enable it, but there's no reason because Thunderbolt is basically PCI Express.
[4056.58 --> 4065.58]  There's no reason why we couldn't have a native pass through solution to a single PCI Express slot, like a simpler solution where the drivers are simpler,
[4065.58 --> 4070.58]  or maybe they'll get their act together and do the drivers where we could actually have all this high performance junk,
[4070.58 --> 4078.58]  like our sound cards and, you know, a raid enclosure and a video card running off of a single Thunderbolt connection.
[4078.58 --> 4080.58]  Then does the desktop die?
[4080.58 --> 4087.58]  If you could have a notebook that you plunk down and have a gigantic docking station that has three GeForce GTX Titans in it.
[4087.58 --> 4090.58]  Then you wonder, is that as elegant as someone wants it?
[4090.58 --> 4092.58]  Well, and that's kind of like my argument.
[4092.58 --> 4097.58]  So like you see like the thinning lights and stuff like this, you know, so it's always a thing.
[4097.58 --> 4099.58]  Were you gesturing to me or the notebook?
[4099.58 --> 4100.58]  Definitely the notebook.
[4100.58 --> 4103.58]  Oh, cause I was about to get all flattered and stuff.
[4103.58 --> 4104.58]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[4104.58 --> 4105.58]  It's popping some tech.
[4105.58 --> 4108.58]  I feel the cashmere, even though it's not cashmere.
[4108.58 --> 4109.58]  No, it's not actually.
[4109.58 --> 4110.58]  It's not very nice.
[4110.58 --> 4111.58]  No, it's from Sears actually.
[4111.58 --> 4113.58]  I just, I picked it up on the way here.
[4113.58 --> 4115.58]  I had to roll a homeless guy to get it, but it's okay.
[4115.58 --> 4123.58]  So, the thing is, like, what I always thought was funny is like, as products came out and they were thinner and they were lighter and you know, like sexy products,
[4123.58 --> 4125.58]  it's like, oh, it's going to be so awesome.
[4125.58 --> 4126.58]  It's going to be so light.
[4126.58 --> 4127.58]  You don't have to lug around that much weight.
[4127.58 --> 4128.58]  It's like, where does it usually end up?
[4128.58 --> 4130.58]  In a backpack with a power brick.
[4130.58 --> 4133.58]  And then since you've got a backpack, you probably got some other crap in there.
[4133.58 --> 4134.58]  You got your headphones.
[4134.58 --> 4135.58]  Got my screwdriver.
[4135.58 --> 4136.58]  Yeah.
[4136.58 --> 4142.58]  So, by the end of the day, it's like, okay, my super thin and light, you know, you know, notebook is now sitting in like a 15 pound backpack.
[4142.58 --> 4146.58]  My battery dock or my extended battery that goes with my thin and light.
[4146.58 --> 4147.58]  Yeah.
[4147.58 --> 4148.58]  Trying to drive that point home.
[4148.58 --> 4149.58]  Well, and that's the same thing.
[4149.58 --> 4154.58]  It's like, or like, you know, like in the airport, you'll see this, like guys that have like the latest galaxy S3 thin phone.
[4154.58 --> 4156.58]  And then it's like in this like Otter box.
[4156.58 --> 4157.58]  Where's your phone?
[4157.58 --> 4158.58]  Yeah.
[4158.58 --> 4159.58]  Right there.
[4159.58 --> 4161.58]  And then a case like that's, oh, it's something in like, or like an iPad.
[4161.58 --> 4165.58]  And then it's in like some triple fold leather thing that where it's like back to this thick.
[4165.58 --> 4170.58]  I have a, I have a Pelican iPad case in the hallway out there.
[4170.58 --> 4171.58]  It's about this thick.
[4171.58 --> 4176.58]  I mean, you could probably run over it with a car, but someone will carry their iPad around in it.
[4176.58 --> 4179.58]  To which I would go, why don't you just carry a notebook?
[4179.58 --> 4183.58]  Well, you know, by the time it gets there, it's like, why don't you just use another iPad as your iPad case?
[4183.58 --> 4185.58]  Like, so like when the one side breaks, you just flip it over.
[4185.58 --> 4186.58]  There you go.
[4186.58 --> 4187.58]  That's revolutionary.
[4187.58 --> 4192.58]  Asus has that with their Tai Chi, the flippable thing.
[4192.58 --> 4193.58]  Yeah.
[4193.58 --> 4194.58]  Yeah.
[4194.58 --> 4198.58]  See, so you, if one screen wears out, you just, I mean, screen protectors just have like more.
[4198.58 --> 4199.58]  Disposable screens.
[4199.58 --> 4200.58]  Disposable screens.
[4200.58 --> 4202.58]  That's how nerdy I am.
[4202.58 --> 4205.58]  It's like, I could fix that, but I'll just rip it off.
[4205.58 --> 4206.58]  Okay.
[4206.58 --> 4212.58]  So let's do our featured system build of the week.
[4212.58 --> 4217.58]  I hadn't quite decided on which one I wanted to feature this week.
[4217.58 --> 4221.58]  I was looking for one in a fractal case, but I couldn't find anything nice enough.
[4221.58 --> 4225.58]  So we're going to go with, we're going to go with my personal favorite case.
[4225.58 --> 4229.00]  This one's not done yet, but this is one to keep it in mind.
[4232.58 --> 4245.58]  And which, as I've mentioned many times in the past is my personal favorite case.
[4245.58 --> 4246.58]  So that's the one.
[4262.58 --> 4263.58]  What if a coach Chen we lost?
[4263.58 --> 4264.58]  Sophie.
[4264.58 --> 4265.58]  She by the gym, that might have some anatomical clothes.
[4265.58 --> 4266.58]  At the book is that you actually see people in the past.
[4266.58 --> 4267.58]  It's the best way out of this one.
[4267.58 --> 4268.58]  All right.
[4268.58 --> 4269.58]  That's it.
[4269.58 --> 4270.58]  Could you choose your style?
[4270.58 --> 4275.58]  If there's some sort of fear in my life when my husband Travis was exploring that.
[4275.58 --> 4276.58]  Questioner 1 is again heading into radio.
[4276.58 --> 4277.58]  So this is nobody.
[4277.58 --> 4278.64] trees trying to go with my bedroom and my restaurants.
[4278.64 --> 4279.64]  That's what we do.
[4279.64 --> 4280.64]  Before we go, please.
[4280.64 --> 4283.08]  How did you do this stuff about Katta,
[4283.10 --> 4283.80]  medicine bonus stuff.
[4283.80 --> 4284.86]  How are you from Sven?
[4284.86 --> 4286.12]  That's great.
[4286.12 --> 4287.32]  Wow.
[4287.32 --> 4288.78]  I'm coming to you fromanny dispensite service,
[4290.28 --> 4291.32] ницы are the làm mensen.
[4291.32 --> 4298.72]  I feel like this change is the one we're doing because it's always a bit difficult time
[4298.72 --> 4305.72]  so I guess what's our thing when I left....
[4305.72 --> 4311.08]  Usually I actually walk through myaising 하고
[4311.08 --> 4315.64]  but it seems like I could have said that
[4315.64 --> 4318.24]  Apparently we lost sound and switch it quickly
[4318.24 --> 4322.80]  deepest and most sincere apologies so I'm gonna go ahead and fix that for you
[4322.80 --> 4327.36]  guys while I explain what I was actually talking about
[4332.12 --> 4338.96]  and we're back okay so I was showing you guys a TJ07 build that I really liked
[4338.96 --> 4345.00]  and how I thought that that one was was pretty cool and then I wanted to switch
[4345.00 --> 4349.24]  over to which one's the one I have open yeah so they didn't hear the dig about your system then did
[4349.24 --> 4353.64]  no they didn't need to hear that that's you can repeat it okay so then basically what happened was
[4353.64 --> 4356.44]  Linus said something about that being the best case waiting for fractal to come out with something
[4356.44 --> 4359.64]  like that that he would use and I said why does it matter you'll never finish your system anyway
[4359.64 --> 4365.72]  thank you for summarizing that so succinctly yes uh so this is a switch 810 build now I'm gonna
[4365.72 --> 4369.72]  come right out and I'm gonna say the switch 810 is not my personal favorite case I've had a lot of
[4369.72 --> 4374.76]  people ask me why I didn't use the switch 810 for my personal rig and the reason is that it's made of
[4374.76 --> 4381.08]  plastic and I personally find that to be not necessarily my favorite thing so this is a build from
[4381.08 --> 4391.80]  Yuck Rick who is maybe from Singapore probably not possibly I'm thinking not from Singapore and he has got
[4391.80 --> 4398.76]  some seriously cool stuff going on in here and the pictures are not showing up on our live stream computer
[4398.76 --> 4406.76]  which is a big problem for me so I'm gonna look for the picture that really uh do you have HDMI out on
[4406.76 --> 4414.04]  that on that laptop there I don't believe that I do so I'm gonna look for the keyword that I really
[4414.04 --> 4420.76]  really liked this picture right here ah yes so very very tasteful if there was one thing that I would
[4420.76 --> 4427.32]  critique about Yuck Rick's build it's that that power supply really doesn't go with that coolant
[4427.32 --> 4433.56]  and it's all about the details but it looks just very very very clean I'm one of those sort of freaks
[4433.56 --> 4441.08]  of nature that actually prefers uh thin thin water cooling tubes to the sort of the thick ones remember
[4441.08 --> 4448.44]  when that half inch id three quarters inch od tubing was in vogue oh yeah why routing was a pain routing
[4448.44 --> 4454.84]  was terrible remember that uh that danger den block that had the what was it the uh mdx with the inlet
[4454.84 --> 4461.64]  and the two outlets yeah yeah yeah the three bar yeah people would stuff like three two and then it would
[4461.64 --> 4466.60]  they like they'd come out and like you couldn't even like the clamps on it to keep everything on the bar
[4466.60 --> 4469.80]  because it's like everything was touching it's like I'll just clamp all of them at the same time
[4469.80 --> 4473.96]  and hope that well that's why your system leaked well I didn't do it I didn't say I used it
[4473.96 --> 4479.08]  do you remember when danger dan had like solid silver blocks oh that's so cool yeah it was like 0.99
[4479.08 --> 4483.08]  troy ounce whatever silver it's like from a little liberian mint or whatever performance
[4484.28 --> 4489.24]  like made no difference it was like two degrees yeah see see it's all about it's all about the
[4489.24 --> 4493.24]  you know what you know what I would ask okay if there's anyone watching who has one of these
[4493.24 --> 4501.32]  consider this an active bid on it I'll pay 500 for a cathar storm block in silver for one of the
[4501.32 --> 4505.64]  ones it's actually made by cathar and if you guys have one then there's no way you'd sell it to me
[4505.64 --> 4513.48]  for 500 so it's uh so it's it's do you remember those though oh I have I have a swift tech storm rev too
[4513.48 --> 4519.72]  that's the closest I have to that sort of monument of water cooling achievement yeah no cathars sort of like
[4519.72 --> 4525.24]  if there if there was an actual overclocking or water cooling guru guy it wouldn't be that weirdo
[4525.24 --> 4532.04]  who ran that weird computer company on the east coast what was it hazard bo east coast yeah yeah
[4532.04 --> 4539.64]  east coast in the middle of the u.s is close to the east coast um so so yeah that's like taking your
[4539.64 --> 4547.08]  armrest by the way just move over why do you want me so close to me pecking order are you i'm just
[4547.08 --> 4551.48]  asserting my dominance yeah yeah he went all alpha male on you he's trying to huddle yeah he's trying
[4551.48 --> 4557.80]  to huddle um yeah if there was anyone that i looked up to more than cathar i think it'd be it'd be
[4557.80 --> 4563.96]  tough to find it'd be tough to find that that person because he basically killed every liquid cooling myth
[4563.96 --> 4571.64]  did you ever see the test he did on quarter inch versus three eighths versus seven sixteenths versus
[4571.64 --> 4577.32]  half inch with all these different scenarios where at the end of it all he basically went yeah unless
[4577.32 --> 4581.88]  you go down to a quarter where you might drop a degree and a half the difference between three
[4581.88 --> 4588.20]  eighths and a half inch is actually really difficult to measure yeah um well it's all perception versus
[4588.20 --> 4593.72]  reality right like you think if this is good that's better so on and the realities i don't mean to pick on
[4593.72 --> 4599.64]  you or anything but it really felt like an american thing well like we started it no like bigger as
[4599.64 --> 4603.80]  well because it never took off in europe in europe they were using quarter inch tubing until like two
[4603.80 --> 4608.92]  three years ago how'd it go here oh in america it was like they skipped everything else and went
[4608.92 --> 4615.24]  straight to half inch tubing yeah that was always though it was always like yeah quarter inch like was
[4615.24 --> 4619.96]  like the thinner tubing was like a lot more popular in europe and then really popular in europe i always
[4619.96 --> 4626.92]  preferred like three eighths thick wall right yeah yeah see the right balance the thin stuff's like
[4626.92 --> 4631.88]  good until it warms up and then it goes yeah yeah exactly so yeah i was always three eighths because
[4631.88 --> 4635.80]  it's like part of it was a compromise because like that really fat tubing it's like oh and then
[4635.80 --> 4639.88]  depending what type of tubing you have it stick to itself yeah you know it's like oh man it's just
[4639.88 --> 4645.96]  such a pain and the fatter tubing actually looked uglier when it clouded and it all did in those days all that like
[4645.96 --> 4653.48]  like whatever claims people made my taigon never cloud yes it did yeah well yes it did they'd use
[4653.48 --> 4657.80]  like the different like i have a copper block and an aluminum block i got a blast brass block it's
[4657.80 --> 4661.32]  like okay get ready for some chemical reaction to be going on in there and it's like what's all that
[4661.32 --> 4669.08]  clouding stuff it's called science oh the early days of water cooling oh here's one for you do you
[4669.08 --> 4674.44]  know what the uh the first liquid cooling radiator actually was uh yeah it was uh everyone was using
[4675.24 --> 4682.12]  car heater cores heater core out of like a ford escort yeah yeah i never went that route i came along
[4682.12 --> 4688.20]  right when guys like hardware lab like swift tech was bringing their radiators to market and hardware labs
[4688.20 --> 4694.36]  was now pretty established so my first radiator actually i had some people asking a question why am i
[4694.36 --> 4701.64]  using that old scuffed up beat up stupid looking radiator in the front of my tj07 personal rig it's
[4701.64 --> 4707.56]  a black ice pro 2 and that was like right when that came out that was like the bee's knees and it was
[4707.56 --> 4715.16]  revolutionary because it had a very very uh open thin arrangement so it was optimized for quiet fans
[4715.16 --> 4719.88]  because up till then everyone was using heater cores if you didn't put deltas on the thing it wasn't
[4719.88 --> 4725.96]  going to perform yeah and then now it's all like triple cross path flow blah blah blah yeah yeah so
[4725.96 --> 4730.52]  that's why i'm using it in my personal rig that's the first radiator i bought for my first water cooling
[4730.52 --> 4738.28]  system so i still have my apogee upstairs um i still have no actually my mcp6 uh 350 which is what i got
[4738.28 --> 4743.16]  for my first loop is gone but i still have that radiator in my system so that still remains so it's just
[4743.16 --> 4749.16]  it's one of those relic type things so let's talk chromebook pixel people have requested this topic
[4749.16 --> 4754.92]  have you guys got any familiarity with the chromebook pixel wow you guys just don't get out much
[4755.80 --> 4757.16]  we're sitting in your garage
[4759.40 --> 4763.72]  studio yeah would you have known about it if people didn't ask you to know about it
[4764.84 --> 4771.48]  no i would have known of it but i wouldn't have actually yeah i know yeah okay so i will i'll brief
[4771.48 --> 4778.68]  you guys on this so are you what i learned three hours ago actually three days ago oh okay yes
[4779.32 --> 4785.16]  and have forgotten most of six let me just bring some stuff up yeah i'm gonna use the power of the
[4785.16 --> 4791.72]  internet which i will harness now on my uh by the way very convenient hunched over computer no
[4791.72 --> 4798.20]  anything i can't go i use my level 10 paraphrasing skills oh speaking of that yeah i mean i love this
[4798.20 --> 4803.16]  thing i actually really do aspire s7 is the first notebooks that's actually gotten me excited
[4803.16 --> 4811.24]  um i mean have you ever seen me excited about a notebook no yeah love this notebook however there
[4811.24 --> 4818.76]  are some obstacles so today our wireless went down and i didn't have an ethernet jack and today we what
[4818.76 --> 4825.64]  was the other issue i had oh yeah i had to plug in no micro hdmi out and i needed i didn't have the cable
[4825.64 --> 4830.76]  and then the other issue was i needed to plug a bunch of peripherals into it to test the included software to do
[4830.76 --> 4837.24]  some stuff and it only has two usb ports but other than those five things and the battery ran out
[4837.24 --> 4843.96]  today six things so i had to put my thing on it and well it's a little loud it's pretty loud it's not
[4843.96 --> 4850.12]  loud now right now yeah mind you it's like 11 degrees in here yeah exactly i do this thing called ambient
[4850.12 --> 4855.72]  cooling i just go outside when it gets warmed up okay so are you guys familiar with the original chromebook
[4855.72 --> 4861.72]  where it was that google chrome browser yeah super cheapo machine like like like you could kind of
[4861.72 --> 4866.20]  like you could kind of put your teeth on it and pry up the plastic holding down the keyboard now it's
[4866.20 --> 4871.32]  got like crazy good resolution and all this kind of stuff so the chromebook pixel has a 1080p screen
[4872.44 --> 4880.20]  beautiful beautiful ips panel it has an aluminum body this is a chromebook pixel it has a premium feeling
[4880.20 --> 4886.28]  keyboard it has like sort of all the bells and whistles it feels like a premium ultra book but
[4886.28 --> 4891.32]  it's a chromebook so chromebook if you guys don't remember all the details basically just runs a chrome
[4891.32 --> 4897.08]  browser and that's it yeah it's over a thousand dollars and it's but it has nice like i think the
[4897.08 --> 4906.68]  screen's like 233 ppi or something does it matter no personally i don't really care about you're gonna
[4906.68 --> 4911.96]  you're you're sort of a crappy co-host if you don't elaborate beyond no okay just no okay it's a
[4911.96 --> 4916.84]  thousand dollars did you ever play that game guess who where the one chick is mrs no or something like
[4916.84 --> 4923.08]  that always answers no no matter what yeah so if you're like do you have uh brown eyes no do you have
[4923.08 --> 4929.00]  not brown eyes no everyone always gets that one right away anyway go ahead um okay so it might be
[4929.00 --> 4934.92]  applicable in some places you know the game right yeah yes i've actually never played it oh it's awesome
[4934.92 --> 4940.20]  i've heard of it and i've seen it but i've never played it um great commercials great commercials
[4944.20 --> 4949.72]  connect four is an awesome game too we should get a copy we should oh that's got a copy look
[4954.60 --> 4959.00]  download the latest drivers for my computer so i can play connect four anyway awesome game we should
[4959.00 --> 4964.92]  get like a game have a championship yeah you'd fly out here for a connect four championship yeah
[4964.92 --> 4970.52]  yeah yeah exactly that'd be a good thing to justify the expensive for connect four championship the
[4970.52 --> 4978.44]  lightest the best thing is i can beat you because i can reach the top of it oh sorry wow oh hey just
[4978.44 --> 4985.08]  back and forth at least my company is still operational which one the one that you're participating in right
[4985.08 --> 4990.04]  now well yeah we're hey we're working in six weeks right now you're doing good that's a long track
[4990.04 --> 4996.28]  record actually we're closer to nine weeks oh see that's me just being bad with math are we closer to
[4996.28 --> 5001.40]  nine weeks yeah this anniversary should we go out for like a blizzard or something yeah yeah nine week
[5001.40 --> 5006.36]  anniversary what anniversary is that paper you brought it you brought a gift
[5006.36 --> 5011.32]  value menu ice cream cone no i think aluminum is an anniversary so it'd have to be like uh like
[5011.32 --> 5017.40]  dishrag anniversary like table scraps anniversary you're gonna finish that thanks baby there's no
[5017.40 --> 5023.40]  scraps left over because the only food we can afford to buy we eat it all i remember that like when i
[5023.40 --> 5026.76]  have my own business like we'd be out doing something i was like just expensive i'm like i work for
[5026.76 --> 5031.32]  myself you know it's like that kind of comes right back to me it's like it's like kiting a check like
[5031.32 --> 5037.00]  like sure hope that doesn't hit the bank first it's like gee i wonder if my boss is gonna approve
[5037.00 --> 5043.08]  this when i get back from the trip boss is a jerk yeah we're talking about something i don't know
[5043.08 --> 5049.08]  probably wasn't it was his opinion oh yeah you're crashing it yeah i'm not that excited i don't know
[5049.08 --> 5054.28]  it's a lot of money for something that's just not super awesome i i found it was in a weird space when
[5054.28 --> 5060.28]  it was first released too the original chromebook because it's like who's actually going to look at all
[5060.28 --> 5064.04]  the options that they have and go okay i want a chromebook and i've heard that they've done really
[5064.04 --> 5068.68]  really good in different regions yeah because they're low cost yeah but this one doesn't have
[5069.64 --> 5074.60]  but it's a premium it's a low it's a low cost premium it almost sounds like a product that was
[5074.60 --> 5078.76]  developed and then they tried to find a market for it yeah you know it's like we made this no who's
[5078.76 --> 5085.64]  gonna use hopefully this guy like okay well here riddle me this then what would you need to do
[5085.64 --> 5091.00]  on a notebook i mean bearing in mind your notebook doesn't run games anyway no yeah okay and i was
[5091.00 --> 5095.80]  gonna say like at the same time we're moving a lot towards cloud storage like uh we don't even use
[5095.80 --> 5101.32]  flash drives anymore within the last month we've gone from like we all carried 64 gig fly i carried
[5101.32 --> 5107.96]  two 64 gig flash drives you carry i carried 164 gig 132 gig and 216 gigs and like in my pockets all the
[5107.96 --> 5113.48]  time and that went from from that to all all cloud within the last month i still carry mine because i'm
[5113.48 --> 5118.44]  hardcore but i actually haven't used mine's in my cart hard for like you get a geek check on the
[5118.44 --> 5126.12]  street yeah how big is yours whip it out i have a three terabyte thumb drive top secret can't talk
[5126.12 --> 5132.44]  about it moving on go yeah did that run on your uh you know your phase change cooling that blew yeah it
[5132.44 --> 5136.52]  did there was like there's a wagon behind me all the time i was dragging around a really long extension
[5136.52 --> 5141.80]  cord but you know it still worked yeah usb thumb drive that's actually just a usb cord that runs to like
[5141.80 --> 5147.64]  a backpack how awesome would that be like a battery powered like you know hard drive on your back and
[5147.64 --> 5153.24]  it's like but it comes out into a usb cable it's got wi-fi too and it probably like plugs into your
[5153.24 --> 5158.92]  like google glass glasses and powers that too so you get a reasonable battery life on those augmented
[5158.92 --> 5163.72]  reality for like it looks like i'm really looking through a file folder right now so cool you know
[5163.72 --> 5169.56]  what maybe this is the future wearable batteries that wirelessly charge all of the devices you're
[5169.56 --> 5176.04]  carrying all at the same time huh don't know what huh should we patent it now don't get wet yeah
[5176.04 --> 5180.44]  don't get wet well hopefully see a bunch of people hiding when it rains lithium battery over would not
[5180.44 --> 5185.40]  be the best test base for no probably not yeah but i would still definitely volunteer because that sounds
[5185.40 --> 5190.92]  fantastic yeah and if they could make them bulletproof then it would be that much then you can survive
[5190.92 --> 5201.08]  through wars and use your cell phone kevlar battery vest why because those are two needs that you have
[5201.08 --> 5205.48]  right next to each other it's like man that guy's shooting at me and i really need to transfer that
[5205.48 --> 5212.60]  file i gotta i gotta tweet this man just a second i said just a second like mark marcus phoenix pulls
[5212.60 --> 5218.92]  out like a smartphone on the battlefield master chief's like oh oh cortana cortana i'm i'm running
[5218.92 --> 5226.52]  out of battery you're gonna cortana's gone yeah if only he worn his battery pack vest so you know
[5226.52 --> 5230.84]  what point in time though is like to go from like a battery pack to like just like a taser when it gets
[5230.84 --> 5237.48]  wet it's like yeah laser tag screw that taser tag yeah you know there would be some hack to like take the
[5237.48 --> 5244.60]  cable from your crazy battery pack and just like jam it into someone would you play okay i i mean is
[5244.60 --> 5249.48]  wood okay like not with real taser like incapacitating bowel loosening tasers like
[5250.04 --> 5254.20]  not not the ones with the darts right because it's like i become a sissy when darts get involved
[5254.20 --> 5260.84]  right it's really gonna hurt yeah it's okay so if you could actually play laser tag with tasers that hurt
[5260.84 --> 5265.24]  like hurt to the point where you get hit in the arm and all your muscles seize up you punch yourself in the
[5265.24 --> 5273.08]  of your gun and just push oh your butt stroking yourself wonderful it's like if only i could
[5273.08 --> 5280.04]  stop pistol whipping myself self-induced pistol whip stop it dude come on if you could play laser tag with
[5280.04 --> 5285.24]  tasers would that be that different from paintball and would you do it i would do it yeah you know
[5285.24 --> 5289.16]  we're all like yeah we try it it's just like when you're playing paintball for the first time the whole
[5289.16 --> 5293.48]  time you're out there i kind of want to get shot to see what it feels like but i kind of don't you know
[5293.48 --> 5296.84]  then you get like it hurts then like the first time you get hit that somehow misses your mask and
[5296.84 --> 5300.52]  hits you in the neck oh okay i don't want to play anymore i'm kind of an idiot about that kind of
[5300.52 --> 5305.88]  stuff though i'll self-admitted i told you my story about breaking my arm you broke your arm playing
[5305.88 --> 5311.40]  paintball my wrist oh you're an idiot so i'm up on the hill so this is not at all related not at all
[5311.40 --> 5317.08]  really like pain induced don't really care just want to still have fun it's i'm up on the hill and i have
[5317.08 --> 5321.08]  really thin bones because i grew really fast i haven't grown since like grade seven or something but i lean back
[5321.08 --> 5325.56]  into the snow and my wrist got really badly sprained so i went to the doctor guy on the hill because i'm
[5325.56 --> 5329.96]  on a school trip and he's like oh sounds like a doctor guy on the hill in a van down by the river
[5329.96 --> 5336.44]  he basically he was drunk there were no windows there you go win yes um he wasn't feeling anything he
[5336.44 --> 5340.04]  splints it and he's like yeah okay don't go back on the hill so i obviously go back on the hill come
[5340.04 --> 5347.72]  back down he's like okay well it's worse now don't go back up i go back up go back down because i screwed up
[5347.72 --> 5352.84]  again and then he's like okay well it's fractured now don't go back up on the hill so i go back up
[5352.84 --> 5357.88]  on the hill it just progressively gets worse and worse so i i would probably play that game you'd
[5357.88 --> 5362.12]  probably play that game because that would be only someone told you not to do it though right because
[5362.76 --> 5367.24]  let me tell you actually compared to paintball which is more like uh it's like a sharp famous pain
[5367.24 --> 5371.56]  it's like clicking in the ear right compared to a paintball an electric have you ever been zapped
[5371.56 --> 5377.56]  by like a pretty decent electric shock i was yes i had my hand pinned between someone like hit me
[5377.56 --> 5382.04]  while i was trying to plug something in and my hand got pinned between a big socket and the wall
[5382.04 --> 5386.68]  but they punched you what were you trying to plug in he was trying to be a joke so he came up and
[5386.68 --> 5392.60]  kidney shot at me while i was trying to plug in a vacuum and it was pretty bad how about you you
[5392.60 --> 5397.00]  ever had any significant electric shock i mean those high-powered computers you built probably what
[5397.00 --> 5403.00]  what they run on like you know 60 volts ac yeah we basically had to have our own separate ups's
[5403.00 --> 5407.32]  behind and everything that's just how we roll do you wear the ups in a backpack yeah i did i did
[5407.32 --> 5411.56]  actually that's how ba i was you know it's like a full proof background it looked like a mech walking
[5411.56 --> 5416.60]  through the living room you know stomping around but no i've never been tasered i did pepper spray myself
[5416.60 --> 5421.40]  one time but other than that was that to find out what it felt like no no i did find out what it felt
[5421.40 --> 5426.60]  like though no it was a thing in college and i was a security guard and the safety on that thing was just
[5426.60 --> 5434.12]  got there i kind of accidentally pepper sprayed half of a mcdonald's so okay so this is totally
[5434.12 --> 5439.48]  unrelated but i might as well explain this now so okay i was a security guard at mcdonald's so yeah
[5439.48 --> 5445.48]  i was getting all the ladies and uh you know something i take your order and kick you out of the restaurant
[5445.48 --> 5451.88]  excuse me my job is to observe okay i'm not going to interact just observe but like you know i'm sitting
[5451.88 --> 5457.72]  there and it's on my duty belt which is a glorious term for security you know duty belt and i go to
[5457.72 --> 5462.44]  lean forward and they have those slatted chairs and i lean forward here all of a sudden you're like what
[5462.44 --> 5467.64]  the and i see like this cloud of pepper spray go up so what do i do you know i'm like i could warn
[5467.64 --> 5474.28]  people no i i move around you know it's like the first thing you want to do is like like that could have
[5474.28 --> 5479.80]  been me i was over here just disperse it but like as i'm walking back to the bathroom i feel my eyes
[5479.80 --> 5484.20]  kind of start to like oh you know but then i'm like i can't be the pepper sprayed security guard at
[5484.20 --> 5487.96]  the mcdonald's right because that would just be even more pathetic than just being the security guard
[5487.96 --> 5493.00]  at the mcdonald's you know so needless to say here people start coughing and stuff then i come back out
[5493.00 --> 5497.48]  of the bathroom like what's going on out here someone sprayed pepper spray i'll find them they're
[5497.48 --> 5505.00]  probably outside in my car let me go drive down to the store and i'll find them yeah so i did that
[5505.00 --> 5509.80]  never never been and that kind of might have happened twice the other time i was in a call
[5509.80 --> 5515.24]  center and i kind of got like i got rid of that pepper spray because it was a bad can it was empty by
[5515.24 --> 5521.08]  the two i pepper sprayed 47 people in two incidents i mean honestly like what type of a group kill is that
[5521.08 --> 5526.52]  i should get like some sort of award for that yeah that must be an achievement and then i actually had to
[5526.52 --> 5531.16]  get pepper sprayed not because of bad behavior but like in police academy i had to get like
[5531.16 --> 5536.12]  sensitivity training right yeah okay yeah so that one was legitimate but they didn't taser you in the
[5536.12 --> 5541.32]  police training because i heard that's a thing that's a thing now we didn't have electricity back then
[5542.44 --> 5548.92]  and pepper spray just throwing peppers at people i mean all Flintstones and stuff so okay okay well you
[5548.92 --> 5554.36]  know what my plan was to tell a stupid story about myself but that like just that i went ahead and
[5554.36 --> 5560.28]  just did that for you yeah i got nothing so i was gonna say my my best shocked experience was
[5560.28 --> 5566.76]  actually an electric fence uh so it was a horse electric fence so did you pee on it it's not it's
[5566.76 --> 5573.08]  not as i know i didn't that's what we all want to know yes not what happened so a horse electric fence
[5573.08 --> 5579.80]  so those i mean they're not as hardcore as house current um but they're a lot worse than the pig ones
[5579.80 --> 5586.44]  and like they're designed for a horse to be like oh no thank you and uh so anyway i um i'd never
[5586.44 --> 5591.40]  actually how they rate them though like do you want pig fence or horse fence yeah i want buffalo fence
[5591.40 --> 5596.76]  you know absolutely absolutely really yeah yeah so the way an electric fence works is it's not uh it's
[5596.76 --> 5601.72]  not a constant current the way that house current is so you have an opportunity to to move away from it
[5601.72 --> 5605.56]  it's like so you're not stuck on it so you're not stuck on it because it causes your muscles to
[5605.56 --> 5609.88]  clench up right all your muscles to clench up but you couldn't pass a vowel movement if you
[5609.88 --> 5616.20]  their life depended on it anyway um so wonderful visual coming in right about how flying is hanging
[5616.20 --> 5621.88]  on to a fence yeah let's talk horse bowels for a moment folks uh it sounds like a public service
[5621.88 --> 5627.32]  announcement it's like we need to talk about horse bowel movements horse bowels want you it's a very
[5627.32 --> 5632.68]  serious problem affecting many horses and some weird people probably your state oh really i didn't even
[5632.68 --> 5636.84]  know what the classifications electric fence were i don't even know what state you're from so that's
[5636.84 --> 5643.40]  good whatever so anyway they they have jolts that come through sort of once in a while and um so
[5643.40 --> 5647.88]  electric electric shock it's not so much a sharp pain like a paintball but it's more of like uh like
[5648.52 --> 5653.88]  like it like it feels like like a like a dull pain so i was feeding the horses and i had one of the
[5653.88 --> 5659.32]  buckets and i was i was hanging up one bucket and i was one of the other buckets was sort of off to
[5659.32 --> 5664.44]  the side while i hung we had two horses when i was growing up so um and also the way an electric shock
[5665.08 --> 5669.88]  works is it has an entry point and an exit point and the one you tend to feel the most is the exit
[5669.88 --> 5676.20]  point so i had a friend with me and um i'm sitting there hanging out the buckets and i turn around i'm
[5676.20 --> 5686.12]  like dude what's your problem don't and he's like what and so i'm like so i turn back and like and and he
[5686.12 --> 5693.00]  kicks me in the butt and i'm like dude i said not to do that and then he's like what and i finally
[5693.00 --> 5698.92]  the third time i'm like what is your problem and then as i'm turned around looking at me he's clearly
[5698.92 --> 5706.60]  not kicking me i feel it again i'm like oh i have the metal strap or the metal hanger for the bucket
[5706.60 --> 5713.16]  up against the fence and it really did feel like someone heaving with like with all of his force and
[5713.16 --> 5718.76]  kicking me right in the rear and i was like what is wrong with this guy like he's like mild-mannered
[5718.76 --> 5723.40]  guy never done anything like that before horses make him snap that's i'm kicking someone's butt
[5723.40 --> 5729.64]  tonight absolutely psycho i just hate horses so much the fact that you're feeding them at all just and
[5729.64 --> 5733.08]  you know when you looked and you saw he's too far away to do it for a split second oh my god is he
[5733.08 --> 5738.28]  telekinetic how is he doing that from over there how is he reaching me this is scary your story was way more
[5738.28 --> 5743.24]  stupid though and that just made my story just terrible so chromebook pixel overpriced under
[5743.24 --> 5749.16]  functional and uh personally i don't think i'd buy one it's after 10 30 so the live stream's over
[5749.16 --> 5753.32]  guys you can leave although we kind of started the after party early tonight because we just
[5753.32 --> 5758.36]  completely stopped talking about computer hardware it all started with the taser tag yeah taser well
[5758.36 --> 5762.28]  taser i i still maintain taser tag would be awesome i think it would you know you know like any guy
[5762.28 --> 5766.92]  would do it just to like you know taser tag and you know what the problem is with i mean both laser
[5766.92 --> 5772.60]  tag and paintball is people who don't report hits if they had to twitch on the ground a little there
[5772.60 --> 5779.00]  could be no question okay legitimate taser though that's insane yeah not quite not quite it'd have to
[5779.00 --> 5783.48]  be to it but they i mean they have to be like a kid friendly taser yes kid friendly and you'd want
[5785.08 --> 5791.24]  and you know what i've always felt that this is pretty stupid about paintball gun hits should not count
[5792.28 --> 5798.28]  okay yeah gun hits shouldn't count why do gun hits count well they should count for something for
[5798.28 --> 5803.56]  what well geez i mean if you take a gun hit in real life you have an odds are it's not going to go so
[5803.56 --> 5806.92]  well for you yeah at the very least you're going to be out right you should have to do something and
[5806.92 --> 5812.36]  if you're firing while it's going off and it hits your barrel you're screwed okay but you're still alive
[5812.36 --> 5817.24]  so fine maybe if you take a shot after you've taken a bullet hit to your barrel you might still be alive
[5817.24 --> 5823.72]  okay hold on hold on okay so let's say gun hit you know you can you can you put it down you if you
[5823.72 --> 5831.56]  can manage to get back to base you can get another gun okay taser tag gun hits wouldn't count but yeah
[5831.56 --> 5835.96]  you might feel them a little bit yeah i'd probably carry right through yeah yeah it'd probably be even
[5835.96 --> 5840.12]  worse it's like you've got to stroke yourself in the face yeah i think distance the exit points further
[5840.12 --> 5844.92]  away yeah that's that's that's actually quite true so i don't really think that we should talk about
[5844.92 --> 5854.60]  that anymore because your point was disproven okay um now you're using a define r4 i think we could
[5854.60 --> 5858.68]  it's probably safe to say that's a bit of a compromise because you're old and you can't see very well
[5858.68 --> 5865.48]  to build a proper computer these days with full liquid cooling all that stuff so but mine runs how's
[5865.48 --> 5874.68]  yours doing oh mine oh the trailer queen out there is that what you're talking about wow you know what i did
[5874.68 --> 5879.40]  a video about that build and people liked it so there you go is it really did you finish the video
[5881.08 --> 5889.80]  yeah i finished the video at least you got one thing done okay what would you want in a truly high
[5889.80 --> 5896.04]  end case would you still to this day if you had let's say you had like a week to sit and build it
[5896.04 --> 5900.60]  and no one else you weren't allowed to do anything else that week what would you want like how many
[5900.60 --> 5906.52]  radiator spots would you want knowing what you know about the actual case design process how crazy
[5906.52 --> 5913.88]  would you go would you put phase in it would you do tech no no um would you go water even
[5915.00 --> 5920.60]  probably yeah like you know if time was no object yeah i'd go i'd go water which case on the market
[5920.60 --> 5925.64]  today sort of fractal hat off if you can do that which case on the market today is the closest to what
[5925.64 --> 5930.92]  you would use for an extreme liquid cool build that you had a week to sit down and work on because
[5930.92 --> 5935.88]  i mean fractal cases are great don't get me wrong my wife uses a fractal case and it's awesome it's
[5935.88 --> 5941.16]  quiet it's she's got great taste good air force something she has good taste in most things and um
[5941.80 --> 5946.44]  but it's not really it's not as modern friendly because there's a lot more tear down that would have
[5946.44 --> 5952.36]  to be done to to paint it for example um it's not as water cooling friendly it's not like fractals
[5952.36 --> 5958.44]  doesn't have a case that fits a quad rad they just they just don't that's reality so how crazy would
[5958.44 --> 5962.28]  you go how many radiators where would you put them see that that's my thing yeah it's going to be a
[5962.28 --> 5969.00]  little bit more of a realist um yeah i'm bringing a pimp myself here i would still say like an xlr2 would
[5969.00 --> 5974.84]  probably do most of what i would need to do uh you know because it can support fat rads which i would
[5974.84 --> 5979.80]  still i'd still rather do like a fat rad than have like you know a 480 or whatever the heck it is you
[5979.80 --> 5986.28]  know okay 480. you know um the other thing is too it's like yeah i don't know i mean
[5987.88 --> 5993.24]  whether i go dual loop or single loop or how i'd go about it a loop is so unnecessary i know but you
[5993.24 --> 5996.60]  know it could be something too like if you're gonna upgrade graphics frequently if you just want to do
[5996.60 --> 6000.84]  that you don't have to drain your whole loop that's true you know i'd probably have like redundant pumps
[6001.80 --> 6006.76]  so okay yeah stuff like that but i mean that's the thing it's like it wouldn't need to be something
[6006.76 --> 6011.32]  the size and i'm not knocking it but like like the 900d i mean it would it could be something like
[6011.32 --> 6016.36]  the size of like an xl you know i i've honestly also wanted to play with like liquid cooling like
[6016.36 --> 6023.96]  a node 304. that would be cool yeah i mean you can support like a you know like a what h80 antek 620
[6023.96 --> 6028.92]  whatever you know even in push pull you know okay but like if i actually went like full open loop and i
[6028.92 --> 6033.48]  know i've seen some guys on forums are starting to play with it um res placement might be a little bit
[6033.48 --> 6037.80]  tricky but i've got some ideas on that you could t line it yeah yeah you could do that you could go
[6037.80 --> 6043.16]  old school yeah you could go old school delrin t line it yeah you know um i remember when the colored
[6043.16 --> 6050.28]  t lines came out yeah do you want to anodize yeah i'll pay an extra 10 bucks for that why but um yeah i mean
[6050.28 --> 6055.16]  i'd like to do that i'd like to do like a liquid coin in a in a no 304 i think just to try it tell me
[6055.16 --> 6060.52]  something though is that the kind of thing you'd build just to try it or is it the kind of thing you'd
[6060.52 --> 6065.16]  build to actually use as your daily driver for the next two years daily driver for the next two
[6065.16 --> 6070.52]  years me personally would probably be like an xlr2 if i was going to liquid cool if you're going to
[6070.52 --> 6074.92]  like if i was going to liquid cool if you're going to air cool what would you pick hmm i'd probably go
[6074.92 --> 6079.00]  like an arc midi r2 you know the thing for me is like he's not going to pick anything that's not
[6079.00 --> 6083.00]  fractal he knows there are other oh man it's almost like i work in marketing what are you thinking
[6083.00 --> 6088.44]  but no seriously i mean for me though i'm happy with what we make like when i uh when i looked at
[6088.44 --> 6091.96]  joining the company that's what i did is i went out and like read all the reviews on the cases to
[6091.96 --> 6095.64]  see honestly if it's good stuff because i wouldn't be able to like go out and speak about stuff i thought
[6095.64 --> 6099.48]  was crap you're not a proper marketing guy at all then yeah i know i have a you're not supposed to
[6099.48 --> 6103.48]  well i guess i don't have a soul because i'm a ginger right yeah well you never stood a chance yeah
[6103.48 --> 6110.60]  exactly exactly i'm a little bit darker than you though but anyway the lights in this garage they're not
[6110.60 --> 6116.04]  tanning lights no they're really not exactly it's like we all look sickly we're all like i really just need
[6116.04 --> 6122.60]  some penicillin and a sandwich you know but yeah i think like for the reason i want to go with the xlr2
[6122.60 --> 6127.32]  is just like there's so much room in it you know they're committee r2 works really well would you cut
[6127.32 --> 6131.24]  up the xlr2 like would you make any modifications to it that's the thing is like it's like the awesome
[6131.24 --> 6137.08]  like blank canvas right i mean and that's like like we got voted in on like i think like overclock.net
[6137.08 --> 6142.12]  awards um the community choice awards for like the different categories like one of them's uh
[6142.12 --> 6147.32]  like most moddable case and it's like we get a lot of appreciation from the modding community for like
[6147.32 --> 6152.84]  the r4 just being so minimalistic right like it's such a blank canvas like you can do whatever you
[6152.84 --> 6157.32]  want to like there's not even like branding on it right i mean we don't even have a logo on it and
[6157.32 --> 6162.04]  actually with arc meteor too the logo is easily removed if you want to do that so we okay yeah so
[6162.04 --> 6166.60]  we've gone that route but yeah i probably would now would i have the ability to really heavily mod it
[6167.16 --> 6171.40]  probably not i'm not like a dremel king or anything like that probably go like bill owen or someone
[6172.76 --> 6179.96]  but what about you uh well if you were going to finish a build what would you do thank you for that
[6182.44 --> 6188.52]  i'm liking these these are good you can stay we need more guests whatever man
[6188.52 --> 6192.44]  i love how he's just he's like i hate you i'm looking dodges off goes through his laptop yeah
[6193.40 --> 6195.56]  like for a typical anti-social behavior
[6196.60 --> 6199.88]  hunchover yeah i have better friends on the internet
[6199.88 --> 6204.04]  they're nice to me they send me twinkies
[6206.92 --> 6211.08]  all right so this is something actually sorry i am gonna i'm gonna kill the after party because these
[6211.08 --> 6214.20]  guys are poor sports and i'm gonna move into another topic that i wanted to talk about
[6214.84 --> 6220.60]  megapixels on cell phones is that something that's been driving you crazy for the last few years how it
[6220.60 --> 6226.20]  keeps going like this yeah and the benefit keeps doing what yeah i know well and like the thing is like
[6226.20 --> 6232.20]  when like when the new phones come out i mean like 13 megapixel camera yeah and like who is it that
[6232.20 --> 6236.92]  had like the the kit where you could like slap the lens on the back of your phone there's a lot of
[6236.92 --> 6240.76]  people there's a lot of those and it doesn't even matter what phone you get there's third parties
[6240.76 --> 6245.48]  it'll be like like and stuff like that like i'm gonna go ahead and put a 700 lens on the back of my
[6245.96 --> 6251.24]  galaxy s3 did you ever see the uh the holder for iphone that's like a yeah
[6253.00 --> 6258.92]  like the shoulder pod holder for iphone yeah yeah i saw some guy who came with a custom made one he went to pax and he was reporting on it
[6259.08 --> 6264.68]  and he had a mic done up through this weird like crazy setup that went through usb to his phone
[6265.40 --> 6269.40]  and then he had like a shoulder pod for it and it was like a shoulder pod but not like
[6269.40 --> 6273.88]  the like presses against your shoulder one that we have it was like a rides on his shoulder shoulder
[6273.88 --> 6279.24]  one yeah like the one that like hangs yeah yeah and i was like that is fantastic because you have this
[6279.24 --> 6284.60]  tiny little phone with like all this crap i can you know it comes back to the thin and light thing right
[6284.60 --> 6288.36]  it only weighs like seven grams but you know everything else with it weighs 42 pounds
[6288.36 --> 6294.20]  one little like metal pipe handle that is a component of this huge elaborated elaborate thing
[6294.20 --> 6300.28]  weighs 10 times more than the phone so guys more megapixels on phones is not necessarily a good thing
[6300.28 --> 6307.24]  because sensor size is everything you can't change physics the bigger the object that you get to blast
[6307.24 --> 6313.64]  with light the more light it can capture period i mean you can throw bigger lenses on it to capture more
[6313.64 --> 6318.92]  light and bring that down to a small object but the ability of that object to capture more light
[6318.92 --> 6324.04]  depends on the size of the sensor at the end of the day and phone sensors while they've been finding
[6324.04 --> 6329.24]  ways to manufacture them with more megapixels that is to say more capture points in that tiny little
[6329.24 --> 6334.12]  spot actually haven't really been getting any bigger and the lenses in front of them are always going
[6334.12 --> 6342.36]  to be garbage i mean garbage compared to obviously a lens this big because the lens stack is like this and it's not
[6342.36 --> 6347.88]  like you can build them out of the highest quality glass optics because like what would that add to
[6347.88 --> 6353.40]  the bomb cost of a phone like yeah you get the photo version it's like an upcharge of 1200 bucks or like
[6353.40 --> 6358.36]  another seven years contract however they want to go about it it's like it's like really yeah are you
[6358.36 --> 6362.60]  kidding when you don't make the lens out of plastic it's a big problem well and really all that for
[6362.60 --> 6373.32]  drunken bar photos that you put on facebook yeah duck face um get out of the mirror yeah so so okay
[6373.32 --> 6380.28]  so the new htc1 is actually the first phone that's trying to say okay we're not going to play the megapixel
[6380.28 --> 6384.76]  race anymore or we're not going to participate in the megapixel race anymore so they've taken their new
[6384.76 --> 6392.04]  phone and i believe it has did it did it did it did it did it um what was it oh crap i can't remember
[6392.04 --> 6398.52]  how many megapixels it is but it's actually less than current generation phones whereas we have actually
[6398.52 --> 6405.32]  like 13 megapixel phones coming out in the market because they're saying that with the larger pixels
[6405.32 --> 6410.76]  you're actually able to capture more light per pixel which is giving better low light performance versus
[6410.76 --> 6414.84]  if you have these little little little tiny pixels that actually individually can't capture much light
[6415.48 --> 6419.72]  so i'd like you guys to check out these photos which i will of course increase the brightness on
[6419.72 --> 6425.00]  my monitor so you can actually see them uh maybe i should show maybe i should show them so this is a
[6425.00 --> 6431.88]  low light scenario competitor one competitor two in the htc one uh part of part of an interesting article
[6431.88 --> 6439.56]  on enantech that i saw was about how is it actually possible for these 13 megapixel tiny sensors hopefully you
[6439.56 --> 6444.60]  guys can see this the top one's brighter that's pretty much the point um is it possible just make
[6444.60 --> 6451.00]  it up for these tiny foam sensors that are 13 megapixels to even resolve like are they as big as
[6451.00 --> 6459.88]  the amplitude of a light wave right and they were smaller so wait when you're when your pixel is actually
[6459.88 --> 6464.68]  smaller than the thing that's supposed to hit it what you're actually doing is you're just over sampling
[6464.68 --> 6469.00]  yeah because it's going to hit three of them at a time they're all going to capture the same thing
[6469.00 --> 6475.56]  so you're just sampling something multiple times it's like if you had a monitor that was uh 1600 by
[6475.56 --> 6482.52]  1200 and then you were going to run 400 by 300 content on it it's exactly the same thing the problem
[6482.52 --> 6489.00]  with this though is conveying that to the public properly because like 90 billion percent photo dorks
[6489.00 --> 6495.32]  already knew this i know but photo dorks aren't 99 how do you convince your mom that her new cell phone
[6495.32 --> 6499.48]  doesn't have to be and how do you convince someone that when they're looking at a spec list for phones
[6499.48 --> 6505.40]  that a higher number isn't better so i think basically i i admire what they're trying to do
[6505.40 --> 6510.68]  because anyone who's trying to buck the the trend that's just like sort of a death spiral trend
[6510.68 --> 6514.76]  where the the higher the megapixels go actually the worse the experience is going to be
[6515.40 --> 6520.44]  um i i i kind of i give kudos to them for having the guts to take a flagship phone
[6520.44 --> 6525.00]  and say no look we're actually going to do what's better for the user experience versus
[6525.00 --> 6529.64]  what's not i mean unlike what his systems always did where they just took the most expensive stupid
[6529.64 --> 6533.88]  thing threw it together in a box and then sold it to some poor sap who doesn't know what to do with
[6533.88 --> 6539.64]  his money or yours where they don't yeah exactly ours ran step number one we beat you
[6542.84 --> 6548.12]  we could benchmark ours but you know the thing is that that's going on you know the age-old perception
[6548.12 --> 6553.40]  versus reality right if two is good four is better eight is you know better so it's easier to play
[6553.40 --> 6557.96]  on that than to try and go in and like challenge established norms you know because you know in
[6557.96 --> 6562.20]  marketing that's where you constantly have problems is you only have people's attention span
[6562.20 --> 6567.48]  for such a short period of time how do you convey that complex of an idea or an idea that flies in
[6567.48 --> 6573.72]  the face of what is conventional wisdom whether it's right or not so how do you do that okay here
[6573.72 --> 6581.16]  tell me something what's a trend that fractal has bucked that you've had trouble convincing people is
[6581.16 --> 6586.44]  good i'll let you think about that for a moment while we do some twitter questions because this is
[6586.44 --> 6591.80]  actually this is something i'm actually interested in getting a real answer to uh what is slick's real
[6591.80 --> 6595.88]  first name he looks like holy crap can you believe he got that right that's incredible
[6595.88 --> 6604.12]  yeah yeah pretty sweet stream especially because i watched it live but so much off topic yeah we know
[6604.12 --> 6614.36]  it's yeah it's me it's always me josh looks like the steel series guy okay mix paintball with laser tag
[6615.08 --> 6622.76]  with water or conductive with taser tag with conductive fluid paint balls like your grenadier has like
[6622.76 --> 6633.80]  saline bombs sean awesome oh okay i was wrong sorry the chrome pixel is 1700 p so it's a super high
[6633.80 --> 6637.88]  resolution actually i don't know if that's right but it's some super high resolution per inch is pretty
[6637.88 --> 6643.64]  amazing yeah it's it's outstanding and there's uh there's a bunch of bunch of like cloud storage
[6643.64 --> 6649.96]  that's included you know what they include three years of one terabyte cloud storage to me it's almost
[6649.96 --> 6657.08]  like the it's like that first hit of like crack where it's like suck you in yeah it's trying to
[6657.08 --> 6661.96]  get you dependent on cloud storage i love cloud storage i use cloud storage all the time we use
[6661.96 --> 6666.36]  almost exclusively you're still thinking about that right yes okay we use almost exclusively cloud
[6666.36 --> 6673.88]  storage internally at uh at my company which is better than biohazard um for any kind of sharing
[6673.88 --> 6679.08]  documents or backups because it is extremely handy to be able to access it anywhere i don't think i'm at the
[6679.08 --> 6683.00]  point where i would pay for cloud cloud storage and i was just going to say in saying that what
[6683.00 --> 6689.32]  we're using for our backups and internal documents is just that internal documents yes we don't upload
[6689.32 --> 6694.36]  anything other than like excel spreadsheets and powerpoint because look at it this way if i was
[6694.36 --> 6700.52]  were to go oh i want to keep my games in the cloud hello it's called steam you download them whenever you
[6700.52 --> 6706.12]  want oh i want to keep my music in the cloud hello it's called itunes or microsoft service whatever that
[6706.12 --> 6712.76]  subscription based one for 100 bucks a year you play whatever you want like the cloud goes way is
[6712.76 --> 6718.12]  way better than some goofy folder somewhere that you drop things into you're not going to use that
[6718.12 --> 6721.88]  what you should be doing is building yourself a nas with that money because as soon as you make
[6721.88 --> 6727.00]  yourself dependent on a cloud storage solution like google drive for only ten dollars a month you can
[6727.00 --> 6733.00]  get this oh you need more oh now it's thirty dollars a month oh now it's forty dollars a month oh wait you
[6733.00 --> 6738.60]  just spent five hundred dollars this year guess how many terabytes of hard drives you can buy for
[6738.60 --> 6744.12]  five hundred dollars at this point okay let's even say two hundred dollars two hundred dollars buys you
[6744.12 --> 6750.60]  a raid 5 array that's probably about six terabytes you know how hard it is to set up like a share on your
[6750.60 --> 6755.56]  computer that you can access from anywhere so cloud storage is great cloud storage is cool but i don't
[6755.56 --> 6761.72]  like the idea of tying myself to that's that's why google wants you to buy a chromebook because then all of a
[6761.72 --> 6766.52]  sudden you are a lifer customer for the entire lifetime of that device which has no storage and
[6766.52 --> 6770.68]  if you think about it you know it's like say you managed to even get like half a terabyte into the
[6770.68 --> 6774.44]  cloud and your three years is up are you gonna switch like no i'm not gonna try and download half
[6774.44 --> 6779.80]  a terabyte of data and put it somewhere else yeah you're gonna stick with it it's gonna be easier for
[6779.80 --> 6784.20]  you to spend that monthly fee and just be like oh i'll do it next month and then it comes up it's like
[6784.20 --> 6789.56]  oh i'll do it and then even when you go oh i don't really have the money right now maybe what i'll do
[6789.56 --> 6795.56]  is i'll i'll download everything and then i'll oh wait because you haven't been buying hard drives
[6795.56 --> 6801.96]  all this time you don't have any space to download i've got 112 thumb drives over here then i'm gonna
[6801.96 --> 6807.08]  start splitting everything on and then that becomes a disaster because you are going to lose a file
[6807.08 --> 6813.48]  100 when you go from one backup solution to another anything that takes longer than like an hour you're
[6813.48 --> 6817.40]  going to create a new revision of some file that you're going to forget which one you backed it up to
[6817.40 --> 6820.68]  you're going to overwrite something yeah unless you're just something enterprise classing like
[6820.68 --> 6825.56]  auto verse or something that does like file checking and basically redundancy and it ages all your files
[6825.56 --> 6830.36]  and it's like okay so then if you go ahead and pull in that enterprise class solution then the free
[6830.36 --> 6837.32]  cloud storage that you had for three years is null and void because i hired a consultant to come in
[6837.96 --> 6843.40]  and a data recovery team seven thousand dollars later i'm glad i got the free three years of one
[6843.40 --> 6848.44]  terabyte storage so i mean cloud is cool and i mean things like my phone you know what it's really
[6848.44 --> 6853.96]  neat you know uh picking up a new iphone plugging it into itunes and going or not plugging it into
[6853.96 --> 6858.76]  itunes rather using icloud and go all your stuff's on it don't worry about it linus we got this taken
[6858.76 --> 6865.24]  care of but i mean seriously how hard would it be to just plug it into itunes and then have it download
[6865.24 --> 6871.80]  all the apps and transfer my music back over like really so i saved myself an hour what's your time worth
[6871.80 --> 6875.80]  to you how often are you going to do that well and i'll tell you like the funny thing too is about
[6875.80 --> 6880.44]  you know anything cloud-based is it's awesome you know i do the same thing for a lot of our files
[6880.44 --> 6883.56]  especially when you have like disparate devices like if i'm on the road it's like oh i want to be able
[6883.56 --> 6888.52]  to grab something off my dropbox or whatever and then you don't have internet access and then all of
[6888.52 --> 6893.16]  a sudden the cloud sucks really hard yeah you know it's like okay that's great that i have it remote
[6893.16 --> 6898.12]  but i you know at least with dropbox you usually have like a local solution but you know pure cloud it's like
[6898.12 --> 6902.76]  it's great until there's some sort of problem with internet until you have like you know a 500 meg
[6902.76 --> 6909.48]  file that you have to tether your phone to download your data charges oh dear god it's not so free
[6909.48 --> 6917.96]  anymore now so yeah and i mean that and i i have my own sort of misgivings about cloud in general for
[6917.96 --> 6922.52]  those of you who don't know i my youtube account got hijacked uh i guess it must have been a couple years
[6922.52 --> 6928.92]  ago at this point and it kind of drove home oh if something goes wrong with a cloud storage solution
[6928.92 --> 6934.52]  whether it's someone obtaining my login somehow or whether it's you know what nobody's nothing's
[6934.52 --> 6942.92]  infallible if something disastrous happened stuff can go down you never had any control over it with
[6942.92 --> 6948.12]  my backup solution mine's kind of extreme where i have an eight drive raid 6 here and then i have an
[6948.12 --> 6954.36]  eight drive raid 5 somewhere else with nightly sinks that's a little extreme but you can use something
[6954.36 --> 6959.64]  like what's that freaking thing called that uh that that cheap solution where you just have two friends
[6959.64 --> 6965.88]  and you run it on each other's computers and then you back up to each other uh i don't remember i don't
[6965.88 --> 6971.00]  remember but whatever it's i mean that's as cheap as you know getting together with a buddy and being like
[6971.00 --> 6977.00]  hey if i buy a hard drive and you buy a hard drive let's back up to each other and let's you know for 50 bucks or 60
[6977.00 --> 6981.72]  bucks we can back up more than we'd be able to do with you know a few months of what we'd have paid
[6981.72 --> 6986.04]  for cloud storage until you have a fight with that buddy and we know where well i wouldn't back up the
[6986.04 --> 6991.88]  pictures of your girlfriend to it oh i appreciate that i didn't mean your girlfriend i mean i wasn't
[6991.88 --> 6995.96]  going to mention your girlfriend on the stream because your wife might see it yeah i know i know i
[6995.96 --> 7001.00]  haven't even met her yet but you know is your wife watching the stream or was she too starstruck by my
[7001.00 --> 7005.96]  celebrity and the fact that i still have a company that i'm running and you don't starstruck or nauseous i don't
[7005.96 --> 7010.92]  know and you know the fact that it's two hours ahead no she's not watching this in fact she has
[7010.92 --> 7018.84]  taste she's not watching this uh 2560 by 1700 okay there you go i was wrong but it's definitely not
[7018.84 --> 7025.24]  worth 1300 bucks yeah good point uh yep what happened to your video the unboxing of the windows surface rt
[7025.24 --> 7032.28]  it's gone no it isn't must be the cloud probably you too blame it on the cloud um wrong resolution on
[7032.28 --> 7037.00]  pixel yep sorry my bad you need to be log into the forum to be able to load the picture so that's
[7037.00 --> 7044.20]  stupid can we change that uh maybe okay cool that must be a new thing with vb5 gold yeah right we're
[7044.20 --> 7051.24]  running vbulletin 5 gold which is their out of beta release there's still like what 400 pending things
[7051.24 --> 7060.20]  there's there's a lot of stuff still broken vb5 gold come on guys please fix your stuff just let you
[7060.20 --> 7066.36]  know oh okay when you swap the browser view yep yep yep got it i got it cool well let's see if there's
[7066.36 --> 7074.28]  any more twitter questions and sort of cool do i own ncix if so you must be rich i own ncix do you own ncix
[7074.28 --> 7080.20]  like the uh you can be a co-owner if you want actually no you can be a co-owner oh why yeah done
[7080.20 --> 7087.24]  good dude cool exactly so the nerdy computer interactor interactive alliance the x is for
[7087.24 --> 7093.16]  alliance like is that what you own or no no no it's the whole thing the whole thing it's like when x can
[7093.16 --> 7100.04]  replace anything uh x name tom please call me x x is a variable yeah exactly it can literally replace
[7100.04 --> 7105.80]  anything mr not so good at math guy right a little tidbit doesn't the x and ncix just literally not
[7105.80 --> 7110.44]  stand for anything yeah it actually literally doesn't stand it's nothing so i was i was borrowing
[7110.44 --> 7115.08]  a page from their playbook no i do not own ncix in fact i don't work there anymore so
[7117.32 --> 7124.20]  definitely don't own it um with the ps4 having 8 gigs of gddr5 by the way do you think the next 10
[7124.20 --> 7129.40]  blah blah blah will support ddr5 no they won't because this was gddr5 which we already have so the ps4 is
[7129.40 --> 7135.16]  actually going to be sharing that 8 gigs between the cpu and the graphics card so this is the first
[7135.16 --> 7143.96]  time i've heard of an x86 cpu using gddr memory so that must have taken some kajiggering yeah apple
[7143.96 --> 7148.20]  talked about how more pixels isn't better when they introduced iphone 4s and continue okay all right
[7148.20 --> 7154.76]  all right well apple setting the trends as usual i suppose just do a home server it's your own personal
[7154.76 --> 7163.24]  cloud yes uh what should i get skype scythe mine 2 or antax 620 closed loop cooler uh 620 is a thin rad
[7163.24 --> 7168.92]  i would probably get a get a decent air cooler rather than rather than going that route unless you want
[7168.92 --> 7177.00]  like um more heat and better looks yeah you want a water heater you know i mean honestly uh you know have
[7177.00 --> 7185.40]  we added a thin rad liquid cooling loop to our results um spreadsheet don't think so not particularly
[7185.40 --> 7191.80]  thin okay we should probably do that because i think people are going to be pretty um surprised
[7191.80 --> 7197.64]  there's a we can bring up we're going to be retesting a whole bunch of the stuff with the h220 yes swift
[7197.64 --> 7205.16]  tech h220 we're gonna so swift tech is pretty adamant that there's no way that there's a 20 degree celsius
[7205.16 --> 7212.60]  difference between their helix fans and our noctua nff12s and i actually agree that's kind of insane
[7212.60 --> 7216.60]  like i looked at slick's numbers because he's the one who actually ran the test and i went
[7217.48 --> 7223.40]  that can't be right so i kind of stood there and supervised and then it was right but we were having
[7223.40 --> 7230.36]  some issues there was pump problems yeah with the pump running at full speed it never actually managed
[7230.36 --> 7236.20]  to properly bleed the loop so you always had air switching through through the pump so swift tech
[7236.84 --> 7243.32]  was like oh well that wouldn't cause a 20 degree swing to which i actually don't i don't agree with
[7243.32 --> 7251.24]  that at all because i've seen air trapped in a pump and no bleeding yeah i mean it's it's a liquid
[7251.24 --> 7256.12]  cooler for a reason if you have air in it you know you're losing capacity right well that and i i've seen
[7256.12 --> 7261.00]  pumps in the past that actually pretty much stop working at all if they have a reasonable size air
[7261.00 --> 7268.84]  bubble caught in them where they'll be moving mcfluid around but it's like yeah like yeah so i think
[7268.84 --> 7273.96]  it's possible that by running the pump so high because remember the h220 doesn't have a dedicated
[7273.96 --> 7279.16]  res it's not as easy to bleed the air from it it's got a res that's built into the radiator so
[7279.16 --> 7287.56]  maybe the pump got burned so bad by well not burned it didn't burn but it got i don't know
[7287.56 --> 7293.88]  whatever gingered so bad that it wasn't working properly to the point where temperatures went
[7293.88 --> 7300.04]  completely out of control so you know we're going to retest everything we're going to test not only
[7300.04 --> 7305.64]  uh helix fans and and we did speak about not releasing those results yeah like internally we
[7305.64 --> 7308.60]  discussed just going well you know what our standard test bench is knocked to us
[7310.84 --> 7315.72]  yeah the um the reason why linus decided to actually end up releasing those results was
[7315.72 --> 7320.44]  because we just thought we would show all of our work and we did mention that pump was on full speed
[7320.44 --> 7326.92]  we did mention that we were using stock fans but it was still not conveyed properly from us i guess in
[7326.92 --> 7331.80]  the end what was actually going on in that test so we're going to do a bunch more tests and try and be
[7331.80 --> 7337.96]  more concise here's a great question from bob and i know it's about uh it's about future products so
[7337.96 --> 7342.92]  in theory you couldn't answer it but uh he asks the question are you guys planning on making a case
[7342.92 --> 7347.40]  that could hold two atx motherboards i think you probably have a pretty safe answer to that one
[7349.56 --> 7356.44]  unless you are man how does he know no uh at this time i can tell you there's no plans for that
[7356.44 --> 7365.96]  so the reply as to why anyone would want that is one system for gaming and one for linux
[7367.88 --> 7370.28]  and having them in two cases would save space
[7372.20 --> 7376.84]  or when one case would save space yeah two cases wouldn't save any space at all no probably not
[7377.64 --> 7381.72]  space seems powerful enough that it doesn't need to be saved well it's been around for a while
[7381.72 --> 7387.40]  captain planet didn't care about space at all did he if it was a great show if you're running a
[7387.40 --> 7390.76]  whole system for gaming and then your second system for linux what are you running on there
[7390.76 --> 7395.32]  if the really low-end system just build a tiny little computer yeah get like a raspberry pi
[7396.28 --> 7401.40]  well it might be running a little bit heavier than that slick's not a big fan of the raspberry
[7401.40 --> 7405.80]  pi would you care to elaborate i've it's unpopular opinion by the way so be ready for that
[7405.80 --> 7410.76]  just all hate you well kind of threw me on the spot i don't have one so i haven't actually tested
[7410.76 --> 7414.68]  that's the spot where i like to throw you anyways yeah i see it coming right now yeah
[7415.80 --> 7424.12]  um i just i'm not a huge fan of the really really low power low-end computer little micro thing i like
[7424.12 --> 7428.52]  arduino controllers because there's interesting functionality that you can get from them and
[7428.52 --> 7432.92]  they're kind of like just placing different circuit boards together and creating something awesome
[7432.92 --> 7437.32]  and it's usually creating more of a hardware controller aspect the raspberry pi is a little
[7437.32 --> 7445.32]  linux computer just not super interested in a super low power super low-end computer okay tell me this
[7445.32 --> 7451.56]  what are your feelings on tool-less versus screwed-in designs for cases uh this is a really good point
[7451.56 --> 7457.48]  that one of the uh one of the forum members made where he goes i have a define r3 and a node 304
[7457.48 --> 7464.76]  so he's seriously a fractal user good job um but putting in and removing hard drives is a bit of a
[7464.76 --> 7469.16]  pain so he actually counts how many screws he has to remove to get a hard drive in and out of either
[7469.16 --> 7474.12]  of those systems and it's eight and eleven so he asks are you guys planning to go tool list for your
[7474.12 --> 7479.08]  entire range of products now i should be careful josh cannot say anything about plans for future
[7479.08 --> 7484.84]  products but how would you personally feel about tool-less designs versus tooled designs and i'll i'll
[7484.84 --> 7489.00]  pitch in my own two cents here at some point as well okay uh you know anything that's going to be
[7489.00 --> 7497.08]  done should be done well um there are a lot of really crappy tool-less designs out there just
[7497.08 --> 7502.28]  terrible that i mean it runs the range from like they don't work the way they should when you're trying
[7502.28 --> 7506.84]  to get something out to where you almost have to go get a tool to pry the dang thing out i've done that
[7506.84 --> 7511.96]  yeah to ones where remember the old thermal take one that green and purple one yeah well and then
[7511.96 --> 7517.00]  there's things where it's like the flip side is okay the ones that like basically have no retention
[7517.00 --> 7521.80]  mechanism whatsoever like the teeth barely engage and then it's like okay your system's fine as long
[7521.80 --> 7526.92]  as you don't move it or pick it up or try and transport it somewhere you have hard drives sliding out so
[7527.80 --> 7533.08]  you know with us we we generally try and perfect everything before we kick it out so we're really i
[7533.08 --> 7541.40]  guess really picky in that regard um i wouldn't say that we're not looking at that um yeah i can't yeah
[7541.40 --> 7547.16]  obviously go into details about what we are we are not doing but you know we've heard that a lot so
[7547.72 --> 7553.32]  it's it's always on the drawing board so here's my take uh personally if i was to contribute something
[7553.32 --> 7560.76]  to fractals plans um particularly for hard drives i actually haven't seen a tool-less mechanism that i
[7561.96 --> 7566.44]  okay there's one that's pretty good cooler masters is pretty good because the sleds are very lightweight
[7567.32 --> 7571.48]  they actually don't stick in very well until you put a hard drive in them and then they're extremely
[7571.48 --> 7577.00]  solid and i can't remember if cooler masters does or not but there are ones that besides being tool-less
[7577.00 --> 7581.72]  give you the option to pop a screw or two into them which i really do like so if you have tool-less
[7581.72 --> 7588.28]  i'd love for it to also accommodate tools um and the reality of it is i haven't encountered a single
[7588.28 --> 7595.88]  tool-less design that actually holds the hardware in as safely and as well as a good old-fashioned screw
[7596.44 --> 7600.76]  well and you know honestly myself it's like you know i tend to swap out components quite a bit and
[7600.76 --> 7606.28]  obviously this might be a different usage scenario but you know it's not something i'm doing every day
[7606.28 --> 7610.12]  you know it's not something where it's such a routine thing that it's that big of a pain for me
[7610.12 --> 7614.04]  now obviously you know if a lot of our customers feel that way you know let us know hit us up on
[7614.04 --> 7619.72]  facebook or wherever but you know it's it's one of this guy pimping his facebook here why do you even
[7619.72 --> 7625.80]  have it posted up no you don't i see how you are but no what speaking of speaking okay you know what
[7625.80 --> 7631.72]  we actually i forgot to do this at all tonight so here we go
[7631.72 --> 7652.44]  this video is brought to you by our trusted partner intel for a limited time only with the

[7664.04 --> 7672.68]  visit intel gaming promo.com yay sponsored spot okay so sorry you were saying something interesting
[7672.68 --> 7678.20]  uh probably not interested but i was saying something um yeah so i gotta figure out how to make that smoother
[7678.20 --> 7685.88]  well the segway and segway yeah yeah you should have like a side of this segway in case you're
[7685.88 --> 7690.12]  curious boom this is what we're doing but you know i think you know what it comes down to is you know
[7691.32 --> 7695.48]  you know let us know honestly if you guys really want toolist stuff i mean we've obviously we've
[7695.48 --> 7700.28]  always looked at how hard is it to go grab a screwdriver so here's been my thing for the longest time and
[7700.28 --> 7703.88]  someone's always going to argue whatever i say because there's always some situation out there where you
[7703.88 --> 7707.96]  don't it's like okay when's the last time you put a motherboard in and not use a screwdriver you know and
[7707.96 --> 7712.76]  it's like you okay you can use some screws and do whatever you want to do oh come on you could i'm
[7712.76 --> 7717.72]  just saying someone's probably gonna say that you could but but you should not yeah and i mean
[7717.72 --> 7722.92]  honestly what are the odds of getting your fingers in there anyway okay well you can't see but there's
[7722.92 --> 7727.40]  like a heat sink here it's like by the time you fight with that you could have gone and gotten a
[7727.40 --> 7733.64]  screwdriver and done it properly yeah personally i like screwing in hard drives anyways because the
[7733.64 --> 7738.76]  second you try and put on some stupid flimsy toolist thing i'm worried about my hard drive
[7738.76 --> 7744.20]  yeah i'm just i want to just screw it in i don't know i'm not a fan of toolist stuff at all yeah so
[7744.20 --> 7749.24]  it's one of those things like it seems like it makes things a lot quicker but i guess you know again
[7749.24 --> 7752.84]  at the end of the day for me it's not something that i swap out a lot and generally the feedback
[7752.84 --> 7757.48]  we've gotten from most of our customers up until now has been you know it's not that big of a thing
[7757.48 --> 7761.72]  it seems honestly like it's more like a bullet point feature point on a product list than like an
[7761.72 --> 7765.72]  actual usability feature because again you know if it doesn't work right then it's just going to be
[7765.72 --> 7771.96]  a source of frustration you know and i mean the only really good tool-less implementations i've seen
[7771.96 --> 7778.36]  even for things like side panels i think corsair 600t is actually a great tool a side panel implementation
[7778.36 --> 7785.80]  two nice solid latches they are solid they actually clip into place i mean tool-less it doesn't hold the
[7785.80 --> 7791.16]  side panel on as well as tooled most as screws most of the time so if you're like jamming cables behind
[7791.16 --> 7794.68]  the motherboard tray and you're trying to get a tool-less panel back on it's just not going to
[7794.68 --> 7800.20]  work uh whereas with that one you actually like it clipped into place and like the clips on the
[7800.20 --> 7807.88]  bottom were solid um it looks ugly it's in the way it's all over your side panel and that was what
[7807.88 --> 7814.52]  people complained about with that case so you look at it and you go okay well like what's the balance
[7814.52 --> 7818.76]  between something that's highly visible and something that's convenient i don't remember li and lee you know
[7818.76 --> 7822.12]  back in the day they used to do it where they had like the captive thumb screw that was attached to
[7822.12 --> 7827.00]  the rail so it's like you don't do the thumb screen you'd slide the rail back and you pop out like the
[7827.00 --> 7831.88]  teeth that was so finicky though but yeah and it was and it was still like okay get the panel on you
[7831.88 --> 7836.52]  kind of push on a little bit and kind of hammer on it right and then yeah so it was made of aluminum so
[7836.52 --> 7841.24]  if you pressed on it too hard the stupid thing on the back bent and and that's the thing and then it
[7841.24 --> 7846.28]  like had a little loop like in case you wanted to lock your side panel on like that's a concern but you
[7846.28 --> 7850.92]  know the thing is there there's a lot of ideas out there that are they're very good on paper but
[7850.92 --> 7856.12]  in practice they just don't pan out because like you said like to do it securely enough you know
[7856.12 --> 7860.76]  it's probably not the most visually pleasing solution and to do the most visually pleasing
[7860.76 --> 7865.96]  solution is probably not secure enough and if you end up with like a themed case like this one so this
[7865.96 --> 7873.96]  is a vengeance c70 from uh some other case company uh from corsair so if you're doing a themed build where you can go oh yeah
[7873.96 --> 7875.96]  you know well let's make it look like an ammo box
[7879.32 --> 7883.08]  that's a way that you can build something that's actually solid enough
[7885.00 --> 7890.12]  holds the panel in place and doesn't look out of place but let's face it swedish design would that
[7890.12 --> 7895.80]  allow for uh clips like this on the side of the case well you know and honestly i think that most
[7895.80 --> 7901.96]  designs you always want to incorporate whatever you can and keep that whole design ethos going right
[7901.96 --> 7907.80]  whether it's more of like a blingy case or you know a flamboyant gaming case or whatever but yeah
[7907.80 --> 7914.60]  it's it's definitely still going to fit the overall theme of what you're doing so yeah it's very it seems
[7914.60 --> 7919.16]  like it'd be something to be very easy to implement and it is but to implement it right is a is a whole
[7919.16 --> 7926.12]  other thing so anything tool-less basically amounts to a lever or a latch somewhere and minimalistic design
[7926.84 --> 7931.64]  is not necessarily conducive to that well if we could do it in a way that you know fit the design
[7931.64 --> 7935.40]  scheme you could have like a lever like a latch on the bottom of the case something like that could
[7935.40 --> 7942.36]  work like a side panel that actually opened up from the bottom out yeah or or or or something sliding
[7942.36 --> 7947.80]  like that or i mean if you could make it still look clean then that might be the solution but i think
[7947.80 --> 7951.88]  it's probably getting pretty late so there's a couple more comments from viewers unless you guys had any
[7951.88 --> 7960.04]  other topics you wanted to discuss i'm tired you must be tired actually do you sleep not usually no i
[7960.04 --> 7971.32]  have a flight in seven hours all right there you go found it um do you use a cm storm trigger could you
[7971.32 --> 7978.52]  recommend it no it's okay uh greetings from germany i just got up and it's 7 30 here thank you for joining
[7978.52 --> 7987.24]  us ah here sean o says just made a build with the r4 amazing case thank you sean we've got a tech
[7987.24 --> 7991.72]  quickie yeah we've got to actually if you guys are not already subscribed to the youtube channel tech
[7991.72 --> 7999.88]  quickie go subscribe i have a video coming out about exactly this topic right here um i still do work for
[7999.88 --> 8007.72]  ncix i still do do work for them although i um how do i i i i do ncix tech tips for them yes
[8008.36 --> 8014.36]  there you go uh i should do more outdoor unboxings yeah it's really cold and really wet
[8015.00 --> 8019.08]  i know ncix handles the gift card giveaways but i still haven't gotten my gift card you should contact
[8019.08 --> 8023.16]  them about it how do you learn about computer hardware besides being a slave like slick
[8023.16 --> 8043.16]  you kind of work me ridiculous hours i work you doesn't feed that sounded just wrong we're done
