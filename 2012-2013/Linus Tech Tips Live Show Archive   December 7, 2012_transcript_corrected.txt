[0.00 → 4.08] Hey guys can you guys tell me how the audio is?
[4.08 → 7.08] Is the audio working fine everybody?
[7.08 → 9.08] Gotta make sure.
[9.08 → 13.08] Yeah that seems like a good idea right about now.
[13.08 → 15.08] Were you even streaming?
[15.08 → 17.08] No, no that was just me.
[17.08 → 20.08] I don't know where I copied.
[20.08 → 22.08] I'm not sure if it's working it shows zero viewers.
[22.08 → 23.08] Oh no it's working it takes a while.
[23.08 → 25.08] It's like the YouTube viewer where it just.
[25.08 → 26.08] And no one hears.
[26.08 → 27.08] Oh here we go.
[27.08 → 28.08] Yeah it just takes a little bit.
[28.08 → 30.08] So I don't know where I copied that to.
[30.08 → 32.04] Let's go ahead and move this here.
[32.04 → 36.92] Hold on guys I'm just trying to find the right file for.
[36.92 → 38.16] Okay guys we have.
[38.16 → 41.44] Yep there we go that's the one I copied the wrong one before.
[41.44 → 43.80] So let's go ahead and paste that there.
[43.80 → 45.36] And we're back.
[45.36 → 46.76] Yay.
[46.76 → 48.76] And yes Slick shaved.
[48.76 → 51.68] He doesn't look like a homeless person anymore.
[51.68 → 53.68] It's amazing.
[53.68 → 56.04] That was disgusting man.
[56.04 → 57.56] It's just terrible.
[57.56 → 62.52] It definitely decreased your sex appeal by at least 18 notches.
[62.52 → 63.52] Okay.
[63.52 → 67.40] I mean did you notice that no one on the live streams was even saying you were hot anymore?
[67.40 → 72.40] I mean that should be all you need to know.
[72.40 → 74.36] I think it's just a little bit.
[74.36 → 75.36] I think it's just a little bit.
[75.36 → 76.36] I think it's just a little bit.
[76.36 → 78.32] I think it's just a little bit.
[78.32 → 79.32] I think it's just a little bit.
[79.32 → 80.32] I think it's just a little bit.
[80.32 → 81.32] That's about right?
[81.32 → 82.28] Everyone says that's good?
[82.28 → 83.28] Is that good?
[83.28 → 84.28] No.
[84.28 → 85.28] I'm just kidding.
[85.28 → 86.28] I'm just kidding.
[86.28 → 87.28] I'm just kidding.
[87.28 → 88.28] I'm just kidding.
[88.28 → 90.24] We're all done with that.
[90.24 → 91.24] All done with that.
[91.24 → 92.24] Yeah.
[92.24 → 93.24] All done with that.
[93.24 → 94.24] How's that?
[94.24 → 95.24] How's that?
[95.24 → 96.24] Should be pretty good?
[96.24 → 99.84] You look devilishly handsome, but there's nothing I can do about the lighting right now.
[99.84 → 103.36] It's done, and I'm like super in the white.
[103.36 → 104.00] Okay fine.
[104.00 → 106.16] There's something I will do about the lighting because it's me.
[106.16 → 109.36] But if it's a problem with you then I think you'll just have to live with it.
[109.36 → 110.56] Yeah.
[110.56 → 111.20] There we go.
[111.20 → 111.84] All right.
[111.84 → 115.28] So welcome to the live stream you guys.
[115.28 → 116.76] I'm at Linus Tech on Twitter.
[116.76 → 118.80] He's at Slick PC on Twitter.
[118.80 → 121.72] So you guys do feel free to.
[122.10 → 125.80] Someone's asking us to remove all the moderators from your Twitch chat.
[125.80 → 129.40] And reassign mods based on a screening process.
[129.40 → 130.76] I'm tired of 12-year-old mods.
[130.76 → 131.02] You know what?
[131.02 → 132.40] That's probably not a bad idea.
[132.40 → 133.92] What do you think?
[133.92 → 139.36] First order of business once we get the forum up and running is got sort of forum contributors
[139.36 → 142.72] as Twitch mods as well as being forum mods.
[142.72 → 146.28] Because honestly I haven't even been paying that close attention to what they've been doing.
[146.28 → 147.28] Have you?
[147.28 → 148.28] No.
[148.28 → 149.28] Not at all.
[149.28 → 150.28] I have no idea.
[150.28 → 151.28] I have no idea whatsoever.
[151.28 → 152.28] I do have something really cool.
[152.28 → 158.56] So just before we actually get started with anything, this is something that I've been
[158.56 → 160.10] incredibly excited about.
[160.10 → 161.88] If you guys follow me on Twitter then you'll...
[161.88 → 162.88] Ow.
[162.88 → 163.88] Oh.
[163.88 → 166.22] I'm breaking everything.
[166.22 → 168.30] If you guys follow me on Twitter then you'll already know about this.
[168.30 → 169.38] But check this out.
[169.38 → 170.88] This is a Thunderbolt enclosure.
[170.88 → 171.88] See?
[171.88 → 173.80] There's Thunderbolt interface at the back there.
[173.80 → 174.80] You guys can't really see it.
[174.80 → 175.80] It's not in focus.
[175.80 → 176.80] It's okay.
[176.80 → 177.80] Don't worry about it.
[177.80 → 179.18] There are a lot of express slots in there.
[179.18 → 187.20] So this is the Magma 3T which is a PCI Express Thunderbolt expansion box that I was hoping
[187.20 → 191.86] I could use to run external graphics on a notebook or on...oh here hold on.
[191.86 → 192.86] Yeah it's okay.
[192.86 → 193.86] I got it.
[193.86 → 194.86] That's just a DisplayPort cable.
[194.86 → 198.74] I've been trying things and trying other things.
[198.74 → 200.94] Seeing if I can get a graphics card going with it.
[200.94 → 207.38] So it's been suggested to me that perhaps the sort of camera should be not pointed at the
[207.38 → 208.38] back of that monitor.
[208.38 → 209.38] There we go.
[209.38 → 210.38] Let's move over a bit.
[210.38 → 213.88] That if I try certain video cards or other video cards.
[213.88 → 221.90] A Squadron 4000 was the one where I was eventually told that I should be able to get it working.
[221.90 → 224.98] Drivers in OS X and there should be no issues.
[224.98 → 225.98] But I tried it.
[225.98 → 231.38] Obviously I don't have OS X, so I...what?
[231.38 → 232.38] Echo?
[232.38 → 235.92] Oh yeah the small echo was my headphones that I was using to make sure that the sound was
[235.92 → 237.58] actually working this time.
[237.58 → 244.68] Because I don't actually have speakers on this computer that I use to stream because if I
[244.68 → 249.04] had speakers playing back everything then you'd get an echo!
[249.04 → 250.04] It works.
[250.04 → 251.04] Yay!
[251.04 → 253.10] So why did I not notice the audio issue?
[253.10 → 255.22] Because I didn't notice the audio issue.
[255.22 → 256.22] Because we have no audio.
[256.22 → 259.18] I guess the real question is why don't I ever notice the audio issue?
[259.18 → 260.62] What's your theory?
[260.62 → 265.44] Well the like incredible amount of times that you've left a stream open is kind of bad.
[265.44 → 266.44] A stream?
[266.44 → 267.44] A stream in the background.
[267.44 → 268.44] Your own stream.
[268.44 → 269.44] Oh my own stream.
[269.44 → 270.44] Yeah.
[270.44 → 271.94] But like that one...
[271.94 → 276.50] I'm there because I'm trying to open the Twitch chat and then while I'm going there to open
[276.50 → 279.22] the Twitch chat the stream's not on so it doesn't occur to me.
[279.22 → 283.18] And again because I don't have any audio speakers on it.
[283.18 → 284.18] I don't realize...
[284.18 → 290.64] Maybe the trick is getting like some closed headphones and then using those to something
[290.64 → 291.64] or something.
[291.64 → 294.40] We could have just something set up at the beginning of any stream.
[294.40 → 295.40] Yeah.
[295.40 → 296.40] Like we could...
[296.40 → 297.40] Oh!
[297.40 → 298.40] We could document processes.
[298.40 → 299.40] Check this out.
[299.40 → 300.40] Check this out.
[300.40 → 301.40] I created a video publication guide.
[301.40 → 302.40] Here.
[302.40 → 304.40] You can read through, and you can actually do all those things now.
[304.40 → 306.40] Slick's just as bad as me just so you guys know.
[306.40 → 309.16] Most of our editing mistakes are actually made by him.
[309.16 → 310.16] Not by me.
[310.16 → 311.16] And see?
[311.16 → 312.16] Look at...
[312.16 → 313.16] No.
[313.16 → 314.16] This has good stuff in it.
[314.16 → 315.16] So...
[315.16 → 316.16] I'll read it later.
[316.16 → 317.16] See?
[317.16 → 320.16] This is the kind of attitude I have to deal with.
[320.16 → 325.16] People who are supposed to be helping me bring you guys the best tech content on the internet.
[325.16 → 327.16] And he's all like, yeah I'll read it later.
[327.16 → 332.16] But you can't just ignore the current goal which is producing a live stream which we're
[332.16 → 333.16] not really doing right now.
[333.16 → 336.16] I'm producing a live stream.
[336.16 → 338.16] At the start it wasn't a very good one.
[338.16 → 339.16] Mind you.
[339.16 → 343.16] So yeah, I mean honestly I'm sorry guys.
[343.16 → 345.16] I'm sorry for all the audio issues.
[345.16 → 352.16] Right now part of the problem is that I'm either using the shotgun mic on the XA-10 or
[352.16 → 355.16] I'm using the lapel mic on the XA-10.
[355.16 → 361.16] It actually bewilders me how many people tell me to use a lapel mic in videos where I am clearly
[361.16 → 363.16] wearing a lapel mic.
[363.16 → 364.16] Have you seen that before?
[364.16 → 365.16] Yeah.
[365.16 → 366.16] Like...
[366.16 → 368.16] And it wasn't even subtle.
[368.16 → 372.16] I'm wearing like not a black t-shirt, and it's like clipped in the middle of a t-shirt.
[372.16 → 374.16] And people are like, why does you really invest in a good lapel?
[374.16 → 377.16] I have a $700 lapel mic.
[377.16 → 383.16] The problem is that it's wireless and particularly in the old tech tips room, a little bit in
[383.16 → 387.16] the new tech tips room and not pretty much at all in this room.
[387.16 → 391.16] There's some random interference, and I've tried changing channels.
[391.16 → 396.16] But every once in a while like I've started putting some bloopers into some of the videos
[396.16 → 401.16] that I've been editing because Slick apparently can't be arched to edit videos these days.
[401.16 → 405.16] And you see some of the horrible like...
[405.16 → 409.16] Like noises that we get, and they'll just destroy shots.
[409.16 → 410.16] Like...
[410.16 → 413.16] We've had to stop shooting because of it so many times.
[413.16 → 414.16] Yeah.
[414.16 → 415.16] It's ridiculous.
[415.16 → 420.16] So the ones that you guys hear are A, not as bad as what we're usually dealing with.
[420.16 → 426.16] And B, I've also gone in the video editing process, and I've taken that like frame or two frames
[426.16 → 433.16] and dialled the volume down to like one tenth so that they're a lot less obnoxious and like ear...
[433.16 → 434.16] Like...
[434.16 → 435.16] Piercing?
[435.16 → 436.16] Ear piercing?
[436.16 → 437.16] Yeah.
[437.16 → 438.16] Piercing.
[438.16 → 439.16] That's the word I was looking for.
[439.16 → 440.16] Um...
[440.16 → 442.16] So yes, I'm sorry for the audio issues.
[442.16 → 445.16] We're going to figure out how to resolve it at some point.
[445.16 → 450.16] Part of the problem is Easel's figuring out all of his finals right now, and we don't have...
[450.16 → 451.16] Um...
[451.16 → 454.16] We don't have any help whatsoever and uh...
[454.16 → 455.16] Yeah, things are...
[455.16 → 456.16] Things are bad.
[456.16 → 458.16] Things are just sort of generally bad.
[458.16 → 459.16] So...
[459.16 → 461.16] Greg, what's our first discussion topic?
[461.16 → 462.16] Uh...
[462.16 → 463.16] Let me see.
[463.16 → 464.16] One sec.
[464.16 → 465.16] Sorry.
[465.16 → 467.16] Well, Intel.
[467.16 → 468.16] Yeah!
[468.16 → 471.16] Okay, well do we want to start that one before the YouTubers sort of tune in?
[471.16 → 473.16] Let me just see if the uh...
[473.16 → 475.16] Let me see if the announcement video is live.
[475.16 → 479.16] Because I'm sure a lot of them saw the original announcement video, and they were like...
[479.16 → 480.16] Um...
[480.16 → 482.16] Yeah, I guess.
[482.16 → 487.16] Are we talking about AC Rotors?
[487.16 → 488.16] Or I guess uh...
[488.16 → 490.16] Oh, that's not a bad one.
[490.16 → 491.16] Yeah.
[491.16 → 492.16] Yeah, you know what?
[492.16 → 496.16] Let's give them a couple of minutes because I think the first comment on that is a minute ago.
[496.16 → 497.16] And so obviously...
[497.16 → 504.16] You know, did you guys know that every person who posts first on one of my videos, I personally email them and I send them a video card?
[504.16 → 508.16] That's why people keep doing it.
[508.16 → 509.16] I can't think of another reason.
[509.16 → 512.16] What about the time you commented first?
[512.16 → 513.16] Well, I sent myself a video card.
[513.16 → 514.16] You sent yourself a video card?
[514.16 → 515.16] Is that how you got your 590?
[515.16 → 517.16] Yeah, I need a video card once in a while.
[517.16 → 519.16] And because I'm me, I can game the system.
[519.16 → 522.16] I can be like, when's the real baller video card coming?
[522.16 → 525.16] And then I'll just be like, oh, sniped first.
[525.16 → 526.16] Nice.
[526.16 → 527.16] You don't even have to like, make a fake account.
[527.16 → 529.16] You just comment first on your own account.
[529.16 → 530.16] Yeah.
[530.16 → 531.16] On your own video.
[531.16 → 533.16] And get this, I save on the shipping too.
[533.16 → 534.16] Right, because then it's free.
[534.16 → 536.16] Yeah, these people live all over the place.
[536.16 → 537.16] I mean, I can just...
[537.16 → 539.16] Like this is how I ship myself a video card.
[539.16 → 541.16] I'm just like, hey Linus, you want a video card?
[541.16 → 542.16] I'm like, yeah Linus, sure, no problem.
[542.16 → 543.16] Oh, whoa, okay.
[543.16 → 544.16] It's okay.
[544.16 → 545.16] It's only an uh...
[545.16 → 546.16] What is this?
[546.16 → 547.16] I don't even know.
[547.16 → 549.16] It's a 650 power edition.
[549.16 → 550.16] It's okay.
[550.16 → 551.16] All is well.
[551.16 → 552.16] Don't worry about it.
[552.16 → 557.16] It would be even better if you went to the post office and then shipped it to yourself.
[557.16 → 560.16] So you could like, get a present at the door.
[560.16 → 562.16] I do love receiving parcels.
[562.16 → 564.16] That is one of the most satisfying things.
[564.16 → 565.16] It's actually so awesome.
[565.16 → 568.16] Remember, you're, you're, okay.
[568.16 → 572.16] Slick's younger than me, but I mean, do you remember getting letters?
[572.16 → 573.16] No.
[573.16 → 574.16] Oh.
[574.16 → 576.16] Well, okay, I get letters from like, my grandma.
[576.16 → 579.16] But I don't remember getting, like, I don't just get letters from friends.
[579.16 → 583.16] Well, like, it wasn't often, but like, when, when you're like 10, and like, even when I
[583.16 → 585.16] got like a bank statement or something.
[585.16 → 586.16] Yeah.
[586.16 → 589.16] Like, just when your parents are like going through the mail, and they're like, oh, one for
[589.16 → 590.16] you.
[590.16 → 591.16] Oh, this is for you.
[591.16 → 592.16] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[592.16 → 593.16] It's exciting.
[593.16 → 594.16] Yeah.
[594.16 → 595.16] It's way better than email.
[595.16 → 596.16] I hate email now.
[596.16 → 597.16] You just get like 30 a day.
[597.16 → 599.16] Email should just die in a fire.
[599.16 → 601.16] Speaking of email that should die in a fire.
[601.16 → 602.16] Okay.
[602.16 → 609.16] Do you know anyone who uses their ISPs email account?
[609.16 → 616.16] Like, do you know anyone who actually, like my, my aunt, for example, not super tech-savvy.
[616.16 → 618.16] It's her name at shaw.ca.
[618.16 → 622.16] And I'm just like, now what are you going to do?
[622.16 → 627.16] I know someone whose super tech-savvy that uses it.
[627.16 → 628.16] Because I was thinking about this today.
[628.16 → 634.16] Like, I don't know if you guys know this, but your Google account is tied permanently
[634.16 → 638.16] to your YouTube account, unless you have a much older account, and you get grandfathered
[638.16 → 639.16] in.
[639.16 → 644.16] In fact, I changed the YouTube or the Google account associated with NCI tech tips at one
[644.16 → 645.16] point.
[645.16 → 652.16] Because it, I was trying to get it integrated with AdSense and something, something, something.
[652.16 → 654.16] But now I think they're locked in.
[654.16 → 659.16] And the tech quickie channel that I recently acquired, I had to acquire the Gmail account
[659.16 → 660.16] as well.
[660.16 → 663.16] And so, so that got me thinking.
[663.16 → 668.16] Because I was thinking about this, and I was like, I actually recently bought a domain
[668.16 → 671.16] and I've set up an email for myself under that domain.
[671.16 → 672.16] More about that later, by the way.
[672.16 → 674.16] Fascinating email I just got from Google.
[674.16 → 675.16] Yeah, like awesome.
[675.16 → 680.16] So, so I set that up, and I was like, what if I forget to pay for this domain?
[680.16 → 681.16] Like I'll be stuck.
[681.16 → 686.16] And I'm like, well, it's not as bad as those guys who are using their internet service provider.
[686.16 → 691.16] I mean, what if you actually used AOL for dial up back in the day?
[691.16 → 694.16] Or like my family, we used Sprint.
[694.16 → 700.16] My family actually used the email address, sea lion1 at sprint.ca.
[700.16 → 704.16] And I'm like, I mean, at the time I didn't know that that was such a terrible idea.
[704.16 → 707.16] But I mean, what does it say about you?
[707.16 → 711.16] I've never used an ISP motorist.
[711.16 → 712.16] Not once.
[712.16 → 713.16] Even when I was a kid.
[713.16 → 714.16] I mean, is there...
[714.16 → 715.16] My family didn't either.
[715.16 → 716.16] Is there...
[716.16 → 717.16] I bet they did.
[717.16 → 718.16] Yes, they did.
[718.16 → 719.16] I bet your parents shared it.
[719.16 → 720.16] Yes, they did.
[720.16 → 721.16] Way back.
[721.16 → 722.16] You know what?
[722.16 → 723.16] Here's our discussion topic.
[723.16 → 725.16] And I'd love to take this to Twitter, you guys.
[725.16 → 726.16] Email best practices.
[726.16 → 728.16] Things that just irk you.
[728.16 → 733.16] Like, why is it that old people don't understand that you don't forward chain letters?
[733.16 → 734.16] Well, there's that...
[734.16 → 736.16] Oh, what is his name?
[736.16 → 738.16] He makes comics...
[738.16 → 739.16] Oh my goodness.
[739.16 → 740.16] The oatmeal?
[740.16 → 741.16] The oatmeal, yes.
[741.16 → 742.16] The oatmeal is amazing.
[742.16 → 743.16] And I...
[743.16 → 745.16] Go to the oatmeal.com right now.
[745.16 → 746.16] Yeah.
[746.16 → 749.16] I promise it is not bikini clad women fighting an oatmeal.
[749.16 → 752.16] Although that would be fine too.
[752.16 → 754.16] I mean, it's the internet.
[754.16 → 758.16] There's probably a site for it.
[758.16 → 764.16] But he goes and talks about how there's pretty much whatever email you have, and you're in
[764.16 → 765.16] the crap list.
[765.16 → 767.16] And then there's the people that have Gmail.
[767.16 → 769.16] And then there's the people that have their own domain.
[769.16 → 770.16] Right, okay.
[770.16 → 772.16] So I don't think I've seen that one.
[772.16 → 773.16] It's pretty good.
[773.16 → 774.16] I do love him.
[774.16 → 776.16] Although I still have a Hotmail account.
[776.16 → 777.16] Right.
[777.16 → 779.16] But there's a legitimate reason for that.
[779.16 → 782.16] I used MSN a lot back in the day.
[782.16 → 783.16] Yeah.
[783.16 → 784.16] Back in the day.
[784.16 → 785.16] Yeah.
[785.16 → 786.16] I...
[786.16 → 789.16] Like it's tied into like forum accounts that are like eight years old.
[789.16 → 790.16] Yeah.
[790.16 → 791.16] For really legacy stuff.
[791.16 → 793.16] But usually you can change the email that's attached to it.
[793.16 → 795.16] You can, but it's like just too much work.
[795.16 → 796.16] What am I going to do?
[796.16 → 797.16] I'm going to go in and like change it.
[797.16 → 799.16] I moved everything to my new Gmail.
[799.16 → 803.16] But I have a Hotmail and I have a Hotmail.co.uk, and I have an Outlook.
[803.16 → 804.16] I have a Hotmail.ca.
[804.16 → 806.16] I have Linus Sebastian at Hotmail.ca.
[806.16 → 807.16] I have CA as well.
[807.16 → 808.16] Basically...
[808.16 → 809.16] So you're just domain squatting.
[809.16 → 810.16] Basically.
[810.16 → 811.16] Like email squatting.
[811.16 → 812.16] Yeah.
[812.16 → 813.16] I want my naming convention.
[813.16 → 814.16] Okay.
[814.16 → 815.16] So email best practices.
[815.16 → 816.16] Things that...
[816.16 → 817.16] Things that irk you.
[817.16 → 818.16] Old people who don't understand chain letters.
[818.16 → 819.16] Chain letters in general.
[819.16 → 820.16] Health advice.
[820.16 → 821.16] Oh.
[821.16 → 822.16] Like...
[822.16 → 824.16] You know what I got from my aunt once?
[824.16 → 825.16] My...
[825.16 → 826.16] I'm sorry.
[826.16 → 828.16] I know my aunt comes up a lot, but she's probably one of the least tech-savvy people
[828.16 → 829.16] I know.
[829.16 → 830.16] She actually sent me...
[830.16 → 831.16] I swear.
[831.16 → 832.16] I swear to God.
[832.16 → 835.16] Someone had a 25 Megabyte attachment.
[835.16 → 839.16] It was a PowerPoint presentation of pictures of adorable animals.
[839.16 → 846.16] And I'm just like, this is the least efficient possible distribution medium for this.
[847.16 → 849.16] And why are you emailing this to me?
[849.16 → 851.16] And she was just like, I hope it made you...
[851.16 → 852.16] And the worst part is she'll actually call me.
[852.16 → 859.72] actually call me like and like to ask me if I read these emails I'm just like no I did not read that
[859.72 → 866.00] email because it's horrible my grandpa sends out a lot of chain mails, but then he doesn't send them
[866.00 → 871.88] to like my brother my dad or myself he'll send them to my mom and then my mom will like filter
[871.88 → 877.02] through them and then just pass forward the okay ones and then that's actually okay, but that's
[877.02 → 881.78] having like a human filter on part of it right and human filter is not a bad thing I mean I don't
[881.78 → 887.60] mind being someone's human filter like again my aunt oh man I have a feeling I'm going to be picking
[887.60 → 893.70] on her a lot here but from time to time she'll get one of those that's like virus alert holy crap
[893.70 → 899.38] your entire internet could be downloaded into the hard drive of the mainframe, and you need to
[899.38 → 903.20] back up your data now and like that kind of stuff she'll forward it to me, she'll be like is this
[903.20 → 911.60] legit, and invariably I'm like no and stop using the internet please um she figured out text messaging
[911.60 → 916.84] on her own at one point anyway let's let's go to let's go to Twitter and let's have a look at what
[916.84 → 923.88] you guys think are some pretty irritating email best practices ah that's a good one okay yes will
[923.88 → 930.54] miracle here squeeze over so we can both share the spotlight I don't think I'm going to make my arm
[930.54 → 936.10] yeah why are you so wide why are you so well it's because I have to move closer to the camera the more
[936.10 → 941.10] I move over here, but I'm obviously not okay well here that day just well okay whatever then just I
[941.10 → 945.96] don't think it's a big deal okay I'll do Q&A, or I'll do I'll do this okay, so Will says I hate when
[945.96 → 952.32] people have goofy email addresses that they give up during a job interview as someone who knows the HR
[952.32 → 960.28] manager at NCI let me tell you if your email address on your resume is like cutiepie69 at hotmail.com or
[960.28 → 965.62] something you are not getting a job like call it discrimination call it whatever you want you're
[965.62 → 970.42] they're not going to email you they're not going to type that into a browser and email
[970.42 → 977.26] that address not going to happen great one Will uh Isaac says five pages with absolutely no punctuation
[977.26 → 983.76] you know what that goes beyond email etiquette that is internet etiquette I am actually okay I try not
[983.76 → 989.28] that's etiquette no punctuation that's just life that's just rude yeah that's just like rude and
[989.28 → 996.48] horrible and speaking of things that are rude and horrible yay I got my remote control now um I mean
[996.48 → 1001.82] I try not to tweet like phenomenally stupid PMs that people send me but did you get the one I
[1001.82 → 1007.62] tweeted the other day oh it was awesome it was like there was no punctuation it was about this long
[1007.62 → 1012.78] and the guy basically bought some core 2 duos or something, and he was asking me if I could do an
[1012.78 → 1019.06] overclocking guide and like a tutorial for like how to use like this motherboard and the CPU I'm just like
[1019.06 → 1025.30] and then he wanted me to send email him the video once I was done making it, and I was just like oh dude
[1025.30 → 1031.16] okay for one thing subscribe I'm not emailing you when I'm finished making a video like what am I
[1031.16 → 1037.26] going to do email 230,000 people every time I make a video I've never made videos and then number two
[1037.26 → 1043.68] there's no punctuation and like it's like this old stuff, and I'm just like oh come on like come on
[1043.68 → 1048.80] man what am I what am I supposed to do to help you with this to help you to on Twitter sometimes I can
[1048.80 → 1053.50] excuse little things like punctuation if you're hitting your character count if like you need that
[1053.50 → 1058.34] one character where the period could be or the comma like yes but if you're is it's a short one
[1058.34 → 1064.24] there are some that are still inexcusable I will never accept d-a as a shortened form of the yeah
[1064.24 → 1070.12] I agree no, no I actually ignore those tweets I won't read them I'd rather squeeze words together
[1070.12 → 1075.36] and just capitalize the second word yeah like I don't mind you for you, I don't mind like uh you
[1075.36 → 1081.08] know bc for because like there's there are ones that it's just like that's okay but don't pretend to
[1081.08 → 1088.18] be a thug on the internet because you aren't you're not a thug and if you're a thug then please don't come
[1088.18 → 1096.34] for me, but I have slick to defend me he's very large he played football once for like eight years
[1096.34 → 1101.34] that's a long time to play football you must have gotten exhausted
[1101.34 → 1109.34] um okay there's some general q and a there I hate when people get long emails from you ah yes
[1109.34 → 1116.24] we're getting perfect ones tonight Dylan says I hate when people receive a page-long email from you
[1116.24 → 1122.86] and they respond with okay or lol that's rude and that you know what actually email I don't run into
[1122.86 → 1127.30] that as much, but I am like when you're having a long conversation with like your girlfriend or
[1127.30 → 1132.32] your boyfriend or something is a perfect example where you can tell like you'll be like having a
[1132.32 → 1136.16] conversation and then all of a sudden you send them like this long-drawn-out thing, and they're
[1136.16 → 1140.36] like lol, and you're like you're watching a video on your computer right now, and they're like yeah
[1140.36 → 1146.84] one thing um I was called out for that at one point in time um for just saying k way too much
[1146.98 → 1152.60] even though like hey and uh one thing I did to actually make it better was just I say right
[1152.60 → 1160.94] that's not better, but a lot of people don't pull that with me, I do you oh crap it just you
[1160.94 → 1166.54] automatically perceive it's longer so you automatically are that why you do OK instead of k OK yeah you know
[1166.54 → 1172.62] what that one I noticed of course that one's not really trying but like so that means it wasn't even
[1172.62 → 1178.80] worth the effort to type five characters because you were only willing to go for two of the same
[1178.80 → 1182.70] well no I say right when I'm typing on a keyboard if I'm typing on my phone I say OK
[1182.70 → 1186.08] because I usually need to type on my phone with one hand yeah you're fired
[1186.08 → 1193.82] it's a twice today yeah twice twice today you've been fired no that's a good one oh
[1193.82 → 1203.42] this is a great topic I love this um my parents use ISP I told them to stop yeah I know I play way
[1203.42 → 1208.02] too many why do we have so many emails combine them all into one you know what that's actually
[1208.02 → 1212.62] something I'm guilty of I do that though kind of because okay I have like a huge list of emails
[1212.62 → 1218.04] but they all port towards one my Gmail and then whenever I respond as that email and
[1218.04 → 1223.50] everything so it's I use one email, so I don't do that because I don't know how, and I could figure
[1223.50 → 1228.80] it out if I took like 10 minutes, but I just haven't it takes no time I know I know so to be
[1228.80 → 1234.12] perfectly honest like for years now I've just been using my NCI email as my primary email for
[1234.12 → 1240.94] everything which is the same problem which is way worse than an ISP based one like
[1240.94 → 1246.66] way worse because with an ISP at least you can be like oh yeah I'm going to cancel my service in six
[1246.66 → 1250.94] months, and I'll, you know figure everything out whereas it is like it's its a job they can just
[1250.94 → 1260.80] turn off your email wow not only that but because NCI uses google apps I have like Google Docs that
[1260.80 → 1267.96] have like all my game CD keys and stuff that are tied to my NCI way to be a hypocrite gee I know no, no I
[1267.96 → 1272.82] fixed it all recently, but I was doing that for the longest time and so people wouldn't know where to
[1272.82 → 1277.94] email me because my personal email address is my personal email address, but I never check it
[1277.94 → 1284.10] like by the time I cleaned it up like a few months ago that's something like 7,000 unread emails most
[1284.10 → 1289.62] of them were like newsletters from motorcycle gear shops and stuff like nothing relevant and then I
[1289.62 → 1294.14] have ones that I've just opened and then used once and then never looked at again, and then I've got all
[1294.14 → 1298.70] of the actual no I legit need a lot of email accounts because I have all of my Gmail accounts
[1298.70 → 1302.66] that are tied to YouTube accounts right so how many people does that apply I have like eight of them
[1302.66 → 1311.10] but like not that many people have that many YouTube accounts right so, so yeah that's that's
[1311.10 → 1314.18] a perfect one people have too many email accounts, and you never know how to reach them
[1314.18 → 1319.60] all right I guess I'm screwed as mine is I play way too many video games people who fanboy over
[1319.60 → 1322.96] things because their product is mainstream and his picture is a character from legal legends
[1322.96 → 1328.42] and you're saying legal I don't think legal legends is mainstream it's the most played game in history
[1328.42 → 1334.30] that doesn't make it mainstream necessarily actually no, no see this is no this is a good topic I
[1334.30 → 1339.30] would if you need a jacket it's right there I'm fine I would make the argument that mainstream is
[1339.30 → 1345.30] something like Internet Explorer whereas Internet Explorer actually is not the number one in terms of
[1345.30 → 1351.42] market share okay, so I would say that again like the default MOB if someone's gonna play at MOB
[1351.42 → 1359.04] they're going to okay NHL 2012 is mainstream but League of Legends I would say is more of like a hardcore
[1359.04 → 1366.36] style game that lots of people play okay but if you play pc games because you're basically
[1366.36 → 1371.24] pulling out just console games right now okay hold on let me find a pc game for you um
[1371.24 → 1374.14] people
[1374.14 → 1382.66] it's a game plants versus zombies you play people plants versus zombies you play plants
[1382.66 → 1386.92] versus zombies I don't think plants bring it on is nearly as mainstream as League of Legends
[1386.92 → 1392.62] okay hold on let me think of a mainstream piece of crap this is terrible I mean that's the state of pc
[1392.62 → 1398.46] gaming you can't even come up with a mainstream pc game if you try that's like just pc game yeah
[1398.46 → 1407.78] wow okay your fine good thank you completely different genre doesn't matter we're talking we're
[1407.78 → 1413.46] talking yeah, but you can have a genre of movie that's like you can have like you can have
[1413.46 → 1419.50] an obscure action movie that lots of people watched like I would argue Blade Runner is relatively is not
[1419.50 → 1423.56] mainstream even though lots of people watch pretty much everyone's heard of it so does that make it
[1423.56 → 1429.78] mainstream no not necessarily I would say because okay here example of a mainstream movie would be
[1429.78 → 1434.64] some something like dumb and dumber that is a mainstream movie, so tons of people watched it
[1434.64 → 1440.04] so I guess it's like not necessarily but you, but it's like it's everyone's heard of
[1440.04 → 1442.32] League of Legends it's got like Jim Carrey in it everyone's heard of League of Legends
[1442.32 → 1445.80] I guarantee you my wife hasn't heard of League of Legends
[1445.80 → 1454.16] not mainstream, but she'll have heard of an NHL game well it's freaking NHL game right, but that's
[1454.16 → 1458.72] what she's heard of World of Warcraft, but she has not heard of League of Legends I wouldn't be too
[1458.72 → 1462.20] surprised if she has heard of League of Legends League of Legends is freaking huge you know what
[1462.20 → 1463.68] we're doing this
[1463.68 → 1467.00] oh my goodness
[1467.00 → 1472.26] hey Vaughn are you feeding the baby can you come here for a minute thanks hon
[1472.26 → 1473.88] you're going to bring her on camera
[1473.88 → 1475.68] she doesn't have to go on camera
[1475.68 → 1478.76] just stand at the door if you don't want to go on camera
[1478.76 → 1480.24] it can kind of see the door
[1480.24 → 1481.28] what?
[1481.54 → 1482.44] it can kind of see the door
[1482.44 → 1485.32] no, no it's okay if she doesn't come through the door then it should be fine
[1485.32 → 1486.08] I'll just stand here
[1486.08 → 1488.68] I hope the audio still picks up okay from here
[1488.68 → 1490.42] are you scrolling through?
[1490.42 → 1492.42] no, no don't go to the top we were getting good ones
[1492.42 → 1494.42] those are all the ones about the email thing
[1494.42 → 1497.42] okay here okay so we have to settle a dispute
[1497.42 → 1500.42] have you heard of the game World of Warcraft?
[1500.42 → 1503.42] can you talk loud so they can hear you?
[1503.42 → 1503.92] yes
[1503.92 → 1506.42] okay have you heard of the game League of Legends?
[1506.42 → 1507.42] yes
[1507.42 → 1510.42] thanks for that
[1510.42 → 1511.42] why?
[1511.42 → 1513.42] I lost
[1513.42 → 1515.42] it's so ridiculously well known
[1515.42 → 1517.42] wait what hold on what?
[1517.42 → 1520.42] how could you possibly have heard of League of Legends?
[1520.42 → 1521.42] I heard them talk about it
[1521.42 → 1522.42] oh she heard
[1522.42 → 1524.42] no she heard Slick talk about it
[1524.42 → 1525.42] that does not count
[1525.42 → 1526.42] that totally counts
[1526.42 → 1527.42] no it doesn't
[1527.42 → 1528.42] that totally counts
[1528.42 → 1529.42] you're a total gamer nerd
[1529.42 → 1530.42] it doesn't matter
[1530.42 → 1531.42] so the fact that you talk about it
[1531.42 → 1533.42] everyone knows a total gamer nerd
[1533.42 → 1534.42] oh no they don't
[1534.42 → 1535.42] yeah they do
[1535.42 → 1536.42] no they don't
[1536.42 → 1537.42] yeah they do
[1537.42 → 1538.42] oh
[1538.42 → 1539.42] I'm eating my mangoes
[1539.42 → 1540.42] okay let's find
[1540.42 → 1541.42] let's find some more
[1541.42 → 1544.42] oh yes when people type every word with a capital letter
[1544.42 → 1545.42] that's the worst thing ever
[1545.42 → 1546.42] yeah
[1546.42 → 1547.42] that's just wrong
[1547.42 → 1548.42] my grandpa does that
[1548.42 → 1550.42] oh the beginning of
[1550.42 → 1552.42] he means the beginning of every word
[1552.42 → 1553.42] yeah
[1553.42 → 1555.42] my grandpa just caps locks
[1555.42 → 1556.42] oh uh, uh
[1556.42 → 1557.42] absolutely everything
[1557.42 → 1558.42] no caps lock is like
[1558.42 → 1559.42] it feels like he's yelling at me
[1559.42 → 1560.42] that's terrible
[1560.42 → 1562.42] you know what's another one that irks me?
[1562.42 → 1564.42] when people share emails
[1564.42 → 1565.42] old people
[1565.42 → 1566.42] oh and Facebook's
[1566.42 → 1567.42] oh my goodness
[1567.42 → 1568.42] like I don't care that you just got married
[1568.42 → 1569.42] you're just
[1569.42 → 1570.42] I don't care
[1570.42 → 1572.42] just keep your separate freaking Facebook's
[1572.42 → 1573.42] yes
[1573.42 → 1574.42] I know
[1574.42 → 1575.42] it's like
[1575.42 → 1577.42] it's like combining email is like
[1577.42 → 1578.42] it's like the new like
[1578.42 → 1579.42] getting a joint bank account
[1579.42 → 1580.42] yeah
[1580.42 → 1581.42] it's like
[1581.42 → 1584.42] no actually I emailed
[1584.42 → 1586.42] like my guy friend
[1586.42 → 1588.42] part of this couple
[1588.42 → 1590.42] because that's who I want to talk to
[1590.42 → 1591.42] that's who this email is relevant to
[1591.42 → 1592.42] yeah
[1592.42 → 1593.42] that's what email is
[1593.42 → 1594.42] and then
[1594.42 → 1595.42] I mean think of
[1595.42 → 1596.42] remember
[1596.42 → 1597.42] email
[1597.42 → 1598.42] electronic mail
[1598.42 → 1600.42] when was the last time you addressed a letter to two people
[1600.42 → 1601.42] that's anything other than a Christmas card
[1601.42 → 1602.42] that's what the
[1602.42 → 1603.42] a card or like an invitation
[1603.42 → 1604.42] it's called CC
[1606.42 → 1608.42] oh that one drives me crazy
[1608.42 → 1609.42] okay
[1609.42 → 1610.42] I love this topic of conversation
[1610.42 → 1612.42] and hopefully everyone else likes it as much as I do
[1612.42 → 1613.42] but
[1613.42 → 1614.42] they seem to
[1614.42 → 1615.42] it's quite possible that they don't
[1615.42 → 1616.42] so
[1616.42 → 1617.42] you know what you want to check the Twitch chat really quick
[1617.42 → 1619.42] and just make sure they don't hate it
[1619.42 → 1620.42] it's one of the uh
[1620.42 → 1621.42] yeah
[1621.42 → 1622.42] yeah
[1622.42 → 1626.42] seems like it's all good
[1626.42 → 1627.42] can you make it go away now
[1627.42 → 1628.42] thank you
[1628.42 → 1629.42] alright
[1629.42 → 1630.42] what else we got
[1630.42 → 1633.42] stuff people hate about emails
[1633.42 → 1634.42] putting stupid email addresses on business cards
[1634.42 → 1635.42] yes
[1635.42 → 1636.42] although I haven't
[1636.42 → 1637.42] yeah
[1637.42 → 1638.42] that's it
[1638.42 → 1639.42] that's right up there with resume
[1639.42 → 1640.42] have you seen it though?
[1640.42 → 1641.42] I have
[1641.42 → 1642.42] you get way more business cards than I do
[1642.42 → 1643.42] yes
[1643.42 → 1644.42] yeah
[1644.42 → 1645.42] yeah
[1645.42 → 1646.42] oh I've seen it
[1646.42 → 1647.42] particularly like
[1647.42 → 1649.60] weird guy running around who does
[1649.60 → 1651.14] game casting or
[1651.14 → 1655.58] some weird media thing where it's
[1655.58 → 1657.68] one guy or two guys, and they think
[1657.68 → 1659.86] it's hip to have
[1659.86 → 1661.34] an email address that's like
[1661.34 → 1663.66] I don't care about authority
[1663.66 → 1665.90] at their domain.com or something like that
[1665.90 → 1667.16] it's a business card
[1667.16 → 1668.56] it's like professional
[1668.56 → 1671.74] although Diesel had a mock-up
[1671.74 → 1673.20] business card that he created for our class
[1673.20 → 1674.96] that was really cool, that was hilarious
[1674.96 → 1677.40] what did it say on it? I don't remember what it all said
[1677.40 → 1678.50] but it was perfect
[1678.50 → 1681.08] I think it sometimes said
[1681.08 → 1684.04] I think it sometimes said I don't eat people
[1684.04 → 1685.02] or something like that
[1685.02 → 1686.44] it was just ridiculous
[1686.44 → 1689.60] and he wasn't being serious
[1689.60 → 1691.30] he wasn't handing me his business card
[1691.30 → 1692.38] he was like
[1692.38 → 1694.34] yeah I think this is funny
[1694.34 → 1695.72] this is a project I was working on
[1695.72 → 1698.56] okay
[1698.56 → 1699.40] so
[1699.40 → 1701.50] what push-pull can
[1701.50 → 1705.16] I get a new email every 5 minutes
[1705.16 → 1707.62] Pming with in-law
[1707.62 → 1708.22] phone rings
[1708.22 → 1708.74] it's her
[1708.74 → 1710.10] yeah
[1710.10 → 1711.80] yeah that's a good one
[1711.80 → 1713.62] yeah
[1713.62 → 1714.46] funny pictures
[1714.46 → 1715.34] that were posted
[1715.34 → 1717.16] like a billion years ago
[1717.16 → 1721.56] John Paul's with me
[1721.56 → 1722.20] about his aunt
[1722.20 → 1722.84] okay
[1722.84 → 1725.42] hey Patrick
[1725.42 → 1726.34] call out
[1726.34 → 1727.02] shout out to you
[1727.02 → 1728.18] for tuning in on your birthday
[1728.18 → 1729.02] awesome
[1729.02 → 1730.94] and these aren't candies
[1730.94 → 1731.80] they're dried mangoes
[1731.80 → 1732.88] they're absolutely amazing
[1732.88 → 1733.86] but they're like $13
[1733.86 → 1735.46] this is the first time I bought them
[1735.46 → 1736.26] in like two years
[1736.26 → 1741.38] you know what
[1741.38 → 1742.36] I don't have any comments
[1742.36 → 1744.18] on the 8970 or the 8990
[1744.18 → 1745.88] we'll comment when the embargo lifts
[1745.88 → 1747.62] once we've actually got the card in hand
[1747.62 → 1748.76] and we've like tested it
[1748.76 → 1751.68] oh my goodness
[1751.68 → 1753.04] G-Force Experience
[1753.04 → 1754.16] we didn't talk about this
[1754.16 → 1755.14] last week did we
[1755.14 → 1757.28] have you heard of the G-Force Experience
[1757.28 → 1757.74] no
[1757.74 → 1758.82] oh
[1758.82 → 1760.28] I've been in like
[1760.28 → 1761.30] school zone for a while
[1761.30 → 1763.54] you know the internal code name
[1763.54 → 1764.44] for it at NVIDIA
[1764.44 → 1765.72] was the GF Experience
[1765.72 → 1768.70] wait for it
[1768.70 → 1769.26] ah
[1769.26 → 1772.00] yeah
[1772.00 → 1774.26] but anyway
[1774.26 → 1775.44] the G-Force Experience
[1775.44 → 1776.90] or the GF Experience
[1776.90 → 1778.36] is really cool
[1778.36 → 1778.70] so
[1778.70 → 1779.70] what it does
[1779.70 → 1780.80] is its basically
[1780.80 → 1782.14] like a driver download
[1782.14 → 1783.40] that babysits
[1783.40 → 1784.88] your entire computer for you
[1784.88 → 1785.54] so
[1785.54 → 1786.42] think of it
[1786.42 → 1787.50] in terms of
[1787.50 → 1788.84] like an optional setting
[1788.84 → 1790.50] so it's not the same conversation
[1790.50 → 1791.16] we had last week
[1791.16 → 1791.62] about like
[1791.62 → 1792.64] soldered CPUs
[1792.64 → 1793.96] where it takes the choice away
[1793.96 → 1795.34] it's an optional thing
[1795.34 → 1796.54] you don't have to install it
[1796.54 → 1798.74] that will configure your system
[1798.74 → 1800.06] according to what CPU
[1800.06 → 1801.62] and what GPU you have
[1801.62 → 1802.86] for every game
[1802.86 → 1805.04] and it will optimize the settings
[1805.04 → 1806.48] so that you don't end up
[1806.48 → 1808.48] playing at a rubbish frame rate
[1808.48 → 1810.40] or with crap details
[1810.40 → 1811.36] and 200 FPS
[1811.36 → 1812.54] because you don't know any better
[1812.54 → 1815.02] it automatically keeps your drivers updated
[1815.02 → 1817.90] and it just makes all these changes
[1817.90 → 1818.74] completely in the background
[1818.74 → 1819.18] without you knowing
[1819.18 → 1820.88] I remember going over to my little brother's house
[1820.88 → 1821.42] yeah exactly
[1821.42 → 1822.40] that's what I was going to bring up
[1822.40 → 1824.48] he has a GTX 275
[1824.48 → 1827.24] and he was running some crap Call of Duty game
[1827.24 → 1828.80] at 1680 by 1050
[1828.80 → 1829.88] low details
[1829.88 → 1831.28] because he didn't know any better
[1831.28 → 1832.62] I turned it all up for him
[1832.62 → 1833.00] he was like
[1833.00 → 1834.54] whoa this looks way better now
[1834.54 → 1836.84] and that's what happens
[1836.84 → 1839.58] I think people not configuring games properly
[1839.58 → 1840.84] is killing PC gaming
[1840.84 → 1841.90] is one of the things
[1841.90 → 1842.98] that's killing PC gaming
[1842.98 → 1844.88] disagree or agree?
[1845.14 → 1845.94] it could totally be
[1845.94 → 1846.68] because a lot of people
[1846.68 → 1847.70] are worried about their FPS
[1847.70 → 1849.04] so they just crank it to the bottom
[1849.04 → 1849.64] and let it rip
[1849.64 → 1851.40] and people who don't think
[1851.40 → 1852.38] the graphics on PC
[1852.38 → 1854.02] are better than the graphics on a console
[1854.02 → 1855.42] which is completely wrong
[1855.42 → 1856.80] which is completely wrong
[1856.80 → 1857.96] and even COD games
[1857.96 → 1858.92] look better on a PC
[1858.92 → 1859.38] okay
[1859.38 → 1860.22] you have to see
[1860.22 → 1860.94] I'll show you like
[1860.94 → 1862.04] after the live stream or something
[1862.04 → 1863.52] some guy posted
[1863.52 → 1865.24] I'm not gonna necessarily say where
[1865.24 → 1865.66] but whatever
[1865.66 → 1867.60] Skyrim after 100 mods
[1867.60 → 1870.50] and you download 100 mods
[1870.50 → 1871.80] that changed just like
[1871.80 → 1872.66] little tiny tweaks
[1872.66 → 1873.64] of how the graphics work
[1873.64 → 1875.84] it's incredible
[1875.84 → 1876.96] like it's like
[1876.96 → 1877.90] hard to reference
[1877.90 → 1878.98] that it's the same game
[1878.98 → 1879.78] just because the details
[1879.78 → 1881.56] are so freaking amazing
[1881.56 → 1882.24] really?
[1882.44 → 1883.24] and like he's like
[1883.24 → 1883.88] oh yeah
[1883.88 → 1885.32] that was perhaps box right?
[1885.68 → 1886.44] no PC
[1886.44 → 1887.52] but he's got like
[1887.52 → 1888.14] he has three?
[1888.14 → 1889.86] just kidding
[1889.86 → 1891.62] he's got like a pretty
[1891.62 → 1892.56] sick rig
[1892.56 → 1894.04] and it pushes it pretty hard
[1894.04 → 1895.68] but it looks incredible
[1895.68 → 1897.72] best looking game I've ever seen
[1897.72 → 1899.04] after Skyrim after 100 mods
[1899.04 → 1899.44] which is like
[1899.44 → 1900.94] that's a crazy amount of mods
[1900.94 → 1902.06] but still you can do it
[1902.06 → 1903.24] and that's the other thing too
[1903.24 → 1904.16] is GeForce Experience
[1904.16 → 1905.32] should be able to predict
[1905.32 → 1906.76] with a reasonable degree of accuracy
[1906.76 → 1907.22] remember
[1907.22 → 1908.80] Nvidia has like
[1908.80 → 1910.54] some kind of super computer thing
[1910.54 → 1911.00] going on
[1911.00 → 1912.80] where it's capable of simulating
[1912.80 → 1914.22] any graphics card
[1914.22 → 1915.86] any configuration
[1915.86 → 1916.64] do you know about this?
[1916.78 → 1917.06] yeah yeah
[1917.06 → 1917.50] I've heard of it
[1917.50 → 1917.70] yeah
[1917.70 → 1919.10] so for those of you
[1919.10 → 1919.50] who don't know
[1919.50 → 1920.36] they have like
[1920.36 → 1921.92] this Uber configuration
[1921.92 → 1923.78] that can just emulate
[1923.78 → 1925.04] any computer ever
[1925.04 → 1926.24] and that's how they do
[1926.24 → 1926.80] their validation
[1926.80 → 1927.86] for graphics drivers
[1927.86 → 1928.84] and for
[1928.84 → 1930.00] for testing things
[1930.00 → 1930.88] like GeForce Experience
[1930.88 → 1931.54] to find out
[1931.54 → 1932.92] they can run any game
[1932.92 → 1933.32] on this
[1933.32 → 1934.24] on any configuration
[1934.24 → 1935.50] and then they can just
[1935.50 → 1936.78] create their own internal
[1936.78 → 1938.86] what makes it look best
[1938.86 → 1940.30] and they actually do
[1940.30 → 1940.92] they have people
[1940.92 → 1941.68] hands-on
[1941.68 → 1942.84] tweaking it as well
[1942.84 → 1944.48] which is really, really cool
[1944.48 → 1946.26] so they can
[1946.26 → 1946.98] they can predict
[1946.98 → 1948.00] with a reasonable degree
[1948.00 → 1948.42] of accuracy
[1948.42 → 1949.14] how it's going to run
[1949.14 → 1950.90] and then what I'd love to see
[1950.90 → 1951.82] for something like this
[1951.82 → 1952.24] in the future
[1952.24 → 1952.74] because remember
[1952.74 → 1954.12] out of everyone
[1954.12 → 1955.76] who has more invested
[1955.76 → 1956.78] in the PC
[1956.78 → 1958.06] as a hardcore gaming platform
[1958.06 → 1958.56] than Nvidia
[1958.56 → 1959.10] yeah
[1959.10 → 1960.68] yeah for sure
[1960.68 → 1961.56] they don't even have
[1961.56 → 1962.38] a CPU business
[1962.38 → 1963.14] to fall back on
[1963.14 → 1963.40] no
[1963.40 → 1964.36] they have Terra now
[1964.36 → 1966.30] but unlike AMD
[1966.30 → 1968.74] they've got gamers
[1968.74 → 1969.32] I mean they have
[1969.32 → 1970.12] things like Tesla
[1970.12 → 1972.00] but gamers
[1972.00 → 1972.90] are still what drives
[1972.90 → 1973.50] that development
[1973.50 → 1974.70] of GeForce graphics cards
[1974.70 → 1976.26] of GeForce processors
[1976.26 → 1977.12] so
[1977.12 → 1979.34] you look at it
[1979.34 → 1979.58] and you go
[1979.58 → 1980.10] so what
[1980.10 → 1980.96] next generation
[1980.96 → 1982.10] maybe they figure out
[1982.10 → 1982.80] oh you've got
[1982.80 → 1983.58] graphics horsepower
[1983.58 → 1984.10] to spare
[1984.10 → 1985.06] let's
[1985.06 → 1985.82] you know
[1985.82 → 1986.54] let's
[1986.54 → 1987.64] suggest some mods
[1987.64 → 1988.02] for you
[1988.02 → 1989.50] and then all of a sudden
[1989.50 → 1990.20] you could turn this
[1990.20 → 1990.94] into a platform
[1990.94 → 1992.12] that not only optimizes
[1992.12 → 1992.86] your driver setting
[1992.86 → 1993.36] for a game
[1993.36 → 1994.60] but actually optimizes
[1994.60 → 1996.60] the PC gaming experience
[1996.60 → 1997.54] so you don't
[1997.54 → 1998.52] so you never have to
[1998.52 → 1999.00] deal with
[1999.00 → 1999.86] ever again
[1999.86 → 2000.66] something like
[2000.66 → 2001.56] launching a game
[2001.56 → 2003.00] which then
[2003.00 → 2004.60] launches at 800 by 600
[2004.60 → 2005.46] and you have to go
[2005.46 → 2006.42] manually like
[2006.42 → 2007.06] it doesn't like
[2007.06 → 2007.76] properly detect
[2007.76 → 2008.98] it would be nice too
[2008.98 → 2009.74] because like
[2009.74 → 2010.54] not even for
[2010.54 → 2011.40] we're talking about
[2011.40 → 2012.10] our own use
[2012.10 → 2013.18] but realistically
[2013.18 → 2013.74] you and me
[2013.74 → 2014.26] are probably going to
[2014.26 → 2014.92] want to configure it
[2014.92 → 2015.20] ourselves
[2015.20 → 2016.30] I'll probably change it
[2016.30 → 2016.50] anyway
[2016.50 → 2016.90] because I
[2016.90 → 2018.38] I have sort of a
[2018.38 → 2019.08] I have a pretty
[2019.08 → 2019.94] crap tolerance
[2019.94 → 2020.94] for frame dips
[2020.94 → 2022.56] so I won't be looking
[2022.56 → 2023.68] at what's my FPS
[2023.68 → 2024.26] right now
[2024.26 → 2025.06] while I'm doing nothing
[2025.06 → 2025.78] I'll be like
[2025.78 → 2026.62] did I see it dip
[2026.62 → 2027.74] crank everything back down
[2027.74 → 2028.26] and that'll be
[2028.26 → 2029.10] slightly different for me
[2029.10 → 2029.84] because in
[2029.84 → 2031.42] in single player games
[2031.42 → 2032.76] I don't actually care
[2032.76 → 2033.48] quite as much
[2033.48 → 2035.38] I want it to look amazing
[2035.38 → 2036.06] still drives me crazy
[2036.06 → 2036.66] and then in like
[2036.66 → 2037.42] FPS games
[2037.42 → 2038.40] or multiplayer games
[2038.40 → 2039.88] I usually drop quite a bit
[2039.88 → 2040.74] just so that I never see
[2040.74 → 2041.44] a frame rate loss
[2041.44 → 2042.20] or anything like that
[2042.20 → 2042.58] but then
[2042.58 → 2043.48] this is going to be
[2043.48 → 2044.36] awesome for like
[2044.36 → 2045.40] oh I just built the
[2045.40 → 2046.56] computer for my buddy
[2046.56 → 2048.66] who wants to start
[2048.66 → 2049.22] playing
[2049.22 → 2050.40] freaking whatever
[2050.40 → 2051.38] Star Citizen with me
[2051.38 → 2052.14] but is going to start
[2052.14 → 2052.86] playing everything
[2052.86 → 2054.84] I want to just load
[2054.84 → 2055.66] this piece of software
[2055.66 → 2056.88] and just forget about it
[2056.88 → 2057.66] and he's going to be good
[2057.66 → 2058.48] like that'll be cool
[2058.48 → 2060.18] and this is the kind of thing
[2060.18 → 2060.98] that really is going to be
[2060.98 → 2062.22] the future of how guys
[2062.22 → 2063.18] like NVIDIA and AMD
[2063.18 → 2063.90] are going to differentiate
[2063.90 → 2064.82] themselves from each other
[2064.82 → 2065.78] because you look at what
[2065.78 → 2066.64] AMD is doing right now
[2066.64 → 2067.32] with Never Settle
[2067.32 → 2068.38] where you're getting
[2068.38 → 2069.18] Far Cry 3
[2069.18 → 2070.32] Hitman Absolution
[2070.32 → 2072.26] and Sleeping Dogs
[2072.26 → 2073.56] with a high-end card
[2073.56 → 2075.34] plus 20% off
[2075.34 → 2076.62] the upcoming Medal of Honour game
[2076.62 → 2078.04] which is insane
[2078.04 → 2079.50] like seriously guys
[2079.50 → 2080.96] if you don't have
[2080.96 → 2081.80] a high-end graphics card
[2081.80 → 2083.82] go buy a 7950 right now
[2083.82 → 2084.66] because it comes with
[2084.66 → 2085.74] three games that are worth
[2085.74 → 2086.32] over $100
[2086.32 → 2088.10] in total
[2088.10 → 2088.86] like you could agree
[2088.86 → 2089.38] that's $100
[2089.38 → 2090.66] they're both $60
[2090.66 → 2092.68] they're all three of them
[2092.68 → 2093.42] no Sleeping Dogs
[2093.42 → 2094.24] I think is now $49
[2094.24 → 2094.72] yeah
[2094.72 → 2095.72] the other two are both $59
[2095.72 → 2096.22] yeah
[2096.22 → 2097.72] so like crazy value
[2097.72 → 2098.56] and I think that
[2098.56 → 2099.74] the entire internet agrees
[2099.74 → 2100.52] that Far Cry 3
[2100.52 → 2101.34] is just outstanding
[2101.34 → 2102.00] it's amazing
[2102.00 → 2102.96] oh my goodness
[2102.96 → 2103.86] so that alone
[2103.86 → 2105.14] like if you're a gamer
[2105.14 → 2105.82] you should be playing
[2105.82 → 2106.50] that game right
[2106.50 → 2107.64] it's so much fun
[2107.64 → 2108.24] yeah
[2108.24 → 2108.78] I don't know
[2108.78 → 2109.28] it's perfect
[2109.28 → 2110.76] so basically
[2110.76 → 2110.98] yeah
[2110.98 → 2112.38] go buy a 7950 right now
[2112.38 → 2113.54] but on the other hand
[2113.54 → 2114.72] you look at what NVIDIA
[2114.72 → 2115.20] is doing
[2115.20 → 2116.20] where I think they're
[2116.20 → 2117.38] bundling Assassin's Creed 3
[2117.38 → 2118.06] and Borderlands 2
[2118.06 → 2118.72] which are both
[2118.72 → 2120.28] legit enough titles
[2120.28 → 2122.32] with some cards
[2122.32 → 2123.62] some cards
[2123.62 → 2124.64] and it depends on the retailer
[2124.64 → 2125.38] like NCI
[2125.38 → 2126.30] I know has some cards
[2126.30 → 2126.96] that come with both
[2126.96 → 2129.44] so they're doing that
[2129.44 → 2130.40] and then they're driving
[2130.40 → 2131.54] things like Stereo 3D
[2131.54 → 2133.14] which whether you like it or not
[2133.14 → 2135.28] Stereo 3D is not going away
[2135.28 → 2136.76] I mean the form of it
[2136.76 → 2137.30] might change
[2137.30 → 2138.98] but it's not going away
[2138.98 → 2140.76] and they have way better support
[2140.76 → 2141.24] than AMD
[2141.24 → 2143.20] things like GeForce Experience
[2143.20 → 2144.40] things like Phys
[2144.40 → 2145.44] so they're pushing
[2145.44 → 2146.46] like the technology
[2146.46 → 2147.14] and it'll be interesting
[2147.14 → 2148.36] to see which one works out
[2148.36 → 2149.54] better in the long run
[2149.54 → 2153.58] but I don't have a clear answer for that
[2153.58 → 2154.10] so yeah
[2154.10 → 2154.84] GeForce Experience
[2154.84 → 2156.38] I haven't tried the beta yet
[2156.38 → 2157.90] and I've heard there are still some issues
[2157.90 → 2159.70] but it's in beta
[2159.70 → 2161.78] and based on where NVIDIA
[2161.78 → 2163.66] like NVIDIA doesn't always do everything perfect
[2163.66 → 2164.30] the first time
[2164.30 → 2164.72] I mean
[2164.72 → 2167.00] look at how long it's taken Phys
[2167.00 → 2169.38] to have a serious impact on a game
[2169.38 → 2171.08] like it does in Borderlands 2
[2171.08 → 2172.10] or in Arkham City
[2172.10 → 2174.26] well Borderlands 2 is kind of
[2174.26 → 2176.44] it makes a difference
[2176.44 → 2177.08] yeah but
[2177.08 → 2178.78] whether you like how they're doing it or not
[2178.78 → 2181.78] but the technology making a difference
[2181.78 → 2182.74] and them going through
[2182.74 → 2183.98] and manually removing things
[2183.98 → 2184.66] for certain people
[2184.66 → 2184.96] okay
[2184.96 → 2186.84] so that's a whole other debate
[2186.84 → 2188.70] but I guess okay
[2188.70 → 2190.02] but something like GeForce Experience
[2190.02 → 2190.62] I don't mind
[2190.62 → 2193.18] because it's not like an AMD card user
[2193.18 → 2194.72] is going to install GeForce Experience
[2194.72 → 2196.62] which will file down all their settings
[2196.62 → 2198.10] although
[2198.10 → 2202.16] that'd be hilarious
[2202.16 → 2203.26] that'd be so hilarious
[2203.26 → 2204.06] if they just like
[2204.06 → 2205.78] set all your settings to minimum
[2205.78 → 2209.60] and every NVIDIA fanboy
[2209.60 → 2210.86] on the entire internet
[2210.86 → 2213.12] found a way to take every like
[2213.12 → 2215.02] AMD card user's computer
[2215.02 → 2217.98] and secretly install the GeForce Experience on it
[2217.98 → 2220.24] so the game just crashes
[2220.24 → 2221.46] and then like
[2221.46 → 2222.88] a legit looking error message
[2222.88 → 2223.86] comes up, and it's like
[2223.86 → 2225.54] it looks like you're not running
[2225.54 → 2226.98] a GeForce graphics card
[2226.98 → 2229.06] and then there's like a link to buy one
[2229.06 → 2232.18] on sale now
[2232.18 → 2234.42] not good
[2234.42 → 2235.40] not right
[2235.40 → 2238.78] not how it needs to work
[2238.78 → 2242.78] hey this is a perfect point from Jared
[2242.78 → 2245.04] I work for our country's largest ISP
[2245.04 → 2247.22] and I hate supporting ISP mail
[2247.22 → 2248.26] it's useless
[2248.26 → 2249.64] leave it to the pros
[2249.64 → 2252.20] and I think the problem with supporting ISP mail
[2252.20 → 2254.10] is the people who are using it
[2254.10 → 2256.04] more than anything else
[2256.04 → 2256.66] it's like
[2256.66 → 2259.16] how do I integrate this into Outlook Express
[2259.16 → 2260.98] and they'll like to call you right
[2260.98 → 2261.48] it's like
[2261.48 → 2264.08] leave me alone
[2264.08 → 2266.40] why are you using Outlook Express
[2266.40 → 2272.40] my mom used to use Outlook Express
[2272.40 → 2276.08] okay I think we're down to where we left off
[2276.08 → 2277.48] so does this have a page up
[2277.48 → 2278.38] oh it does
[2278.38 → 2278.78] no way
[2278.78 → 2280.08] so cool
[2280.08 → 2281.00] oh my goodness
[2281.00 → 2281.86] look at all these emails
[2281.86 → 2283.72] this thing has a mouse on it
[2283.72 → 2284.50] emails
[2284.50 → 2285.44] are a tweet
[2285.44 → 2287.10] how did you not know that had a mouse on it?
[2287.10 → 2287.60] you know what
[2287.60 → 2288.24] screw you
[2288.24 → 2289.98] you use that all the time
[2289.98 → 2291.32] well no I don't
[2291.32 → 2293.16] I only ever used it as like a remote
[2293.16 → 2295.04] remember I opened the package for this
[2295.04 → 2295.66] right
[2295.66 → 2297.16] the first day we recorded on the thing
[2297.16 → 2299.20] did you have a different one that had a little mouse on it though?
[2299.34 → 2300.58] that's not even like the same thing
[2300.58 → 2301.54] no, no that's Su deco
[2301.54 → 2302.36] oh okay
[2302.36 → 2303.52] and that one's like an air mouse
[2303.52 → 2304.48] so you just go like this
[2304.48 → 2305.00] oh okay
[2305.00 → 2305.46] point at that stuff
[2305.46 → 2305.70] okay
[2305.70 → 2306.50] okay
[2306.50 → 2307.82] uh you know what
[2307.82 → 2310.20] okay let's do some more Twitter Q&A for a little bit
[2310.20 → 2312.28] and then you get started with Twitter Q&A
[2312.28 → 2313.76] and then I'm going to go find
[2313.76 → 2314.90] I had a couple other topics
[2314.90 → 2315.96] I really wanted to talk
[2315.96 → 2318.12] oh we have to do the Intel one
[2318.12 → 2318.78] and Intel
[2318.78 → 2319.66] oh and AC
[2319.66 → 2320.34] and the new YouTube
[2320.34 → 2321.48] okay no we got lots of topics
[2321.48 → 2321.80] okay
[2321.80 → 2322.98] okay don't worry guys
[2322.98 → 2323.44] lots of topics
[2323.44 → 2324.80] nah you do Twitter Q&A for a bit
[2324.80 → 2326.00] I'm hungry anyway
[2326.00 → 2326.84] go take my seat
[2326.84 → 2329.06] I'll be back
[2329.06 → 2332.22] how do you even
[2332.22 → 2333.44] you guys have to tweet me
[2333.44 → 2335.10] if he says anything rude or disrespectful
[2335.10 → 2336.08] about me while I'm gone
[2336.08 → 2338.60] oh my goodness
[2338.60 → 2340.76] you can't read from there can you?
[2340.76 → 2341.90] no I have terrible eyes
[2341.90 → 2343.86] do you need your glasses?
[2344.12 → 2344.96] I don't have them here
[2344.96 → 2345.92] I'll make do
[2345.92 → 2349.38] sorry
[2349.38 → 2352.38] best onboard audio I've ever heard on a laptop
[2352.38 → 2354.32] was probably the MSI
[2354.32 → 2355.32] Ice Power
[2355.32 → 2356.06] is it called Ice Power?
[2356.06 → 2357.18] uh Dine Audio
[2357.18 → 2357.86] Dine Audio
[2357.86 → 2358.74] who's got Ice Power?
[2358.86 → 2359.42] way better
[2359.42 → 2360.36] I don't know what Ice Power
[2360.36 → 2361.88] I don't remember who has Ice Power
[2361.88 → 2362.48] but uh
[2362.48 → 2363.90] the MSI Dine Audio one
[2363.90 → 2364.56] is like
[2364.56 → 2365.44] super legit
[2365.44 → 2367.02] way better than anything else
[2367.02 → 2367.64] I'd encounter
[2367.64 → 2368.84] I've never heard
[2368.84 → 2369.64] I've never heart Beats Audio though
[2369.64 → 2372.16] um I've got a friend at school
[2372.16 → 2372.68] that has one
[2372.68 → 2374.24] it isn't one of the high-end laptops
[2374.24 → 2375.50] it's one of the
[2375.50 → 2377.00] more business oriented laptops
[2377.00 → 2378.26] and I didn't really notice a difference
[2378.26 → 2379.64] but it has like
[2379.64 → 2382.36] bass on the bottom
[2382.36 → 2383.42] but
[2383.42 → 2384.04] like a sub?
[2384.24 → 2384.56] yeah
[2384.56 → 2387.60] but
[2387.60 → 2389.02] if I'm on my laptop
[2389.02 → 2390.98] I'm probably listening to headphones anyway
[2390.98 → 2391.88] so it doesn't really help
[2391.88 → 2393.88] what do you mean it doesn't help?
[2393.88 → 2394.88] I've
[2394.88 → 2396.62] having a subwoofer on the bottom?
[2396.62 → 2397.38] oh, oh okay
[2397.38 → 2398.16] well no, but I mean
[2398.16 → 2400.52] it would help if the audio chipset was better
[2400.52 → 2400.98] yeah
[2400.98 → 2402.06] no that's what I'm saying
[2402.06 → 2403.22] but I didn't notice a difference with
[2403.22 → 2405.04] there's a cat
[2405.04 → 2406.74] look at the camera
[2406.74 → 2409.96] this is not why I haven't actually left yet
[2409.96 → 2411.40] the cat got into the garage
[2411.40 → 2413.20] okay let's see
[2413.20 → 2415.84] no I do not think the world will end
[2415.84 → 2419.12] I'm surprised that was actually a question
[2419.12 → 2421.16] can you post Skyrim thing
[2421.16 → 2422.12] video description on YouTube?
[2423.22 → 2424.12] um I don't think
[2424.12 → 2425.84] I don't think we'll post it on YouTube
[2425.84 → 2428.54] um but if people spam me on Twitter
[2428.54 → 2429.26] so I don't forget
[2429.26 → 2431.50] I will post a link to the guy's
[2431.50 → 2433.22] blog or whatever it is
[2433.22 → 2434.50] that has the 100 mods
[2434.50 → 2435.52] because it's pretty epic
[2435.52 → 2437.52] I'm planning that as a project
[2437.52 → 2438.98] over Christmas break
[2438.98 → 2440.98] I want to set up my Skyrim with 100 mods
[2440.98 → 2443.98] and just look at how ridiculously fantastic it is
[2443.98 → 2445.98] um
[2445.98 → 2450.98] getting
[2450.98 → 2452.92] get an Asus Zone STX
[2452.92 → 2454.32] Alex at Chicken wind
[2454.32 → 2455.92] that card is amazing
[2455.92 → 2457.62] I have 595s
[2457.62 → 2458.14] which are
[2458.14 → 2460.88] pretty damn close to 598s
[2460.88 → 2461.38] and
[2461.38 → 2461.98] um
[2461.98 → 2463.94] we did some sound card testing
[2463.94 → 2465.14] and I could tell a difference
[2465.14 → 2467.00] moving up to the Zone STX
[2467.00 → 2468.86] with most lower end headphones
[2468.86 → 2469.94] I couldn't really tell a difference
[2469.94 → 2470.68] moving up to that
[2470.68 → 2471.86] high end of a sound card
[2471.86 → 2472.20] but
[2472.20 → 2474.86] with something like 598s
[2474.86 → 2475.74] or 595s
[2475.74 → 2477.44] uh you can really tell a difference
[2477.44 → 2478.68] uh
[2478.68 → 2480.28] when are you going to do
[2480.28 → 2481.18] promise response time?
[2482.62 → 2483.78] uh that response time video
[2483.78 → 2484.34] will happen
[2484.34 → 2486.52] uh we're just really busy right now
[2486.52 → 2487.32] I'm in finals
[2487.32 → 2487.84] I've got
[2487.84 → 2489.54] tons of finals next week
[2489.54 → 2489.68] um
[2489.68 → 2491.36] once that's over with
[2491.36 → 2492.44] we'll probably look into more
[2492.44 → 2493.62] of the
[2493.62 → 2493.96] the
[2493.96 → 2494.54] the
[2494.54 → 2495.90] that style of content videos
[2495.90 → 2496.68] that we've been talking about
[2496.68 → 2497.26] for a long time
[2497.26 → 2498.78] move into a lot of those
[2498.78 → 2507.40] console and PC gamer rant?
[2507.58 → 2508.22] I don't know
[2508.22 → 2508.90] um
[2508.90 → 2511.58] there's reason for both
[2511.58 → 2512.64] and like
[2512.64 → 2513.74] the thing is
[2513.74 → 2514.38] it's pointless
[2514.38 → 2515.66] because everyone likes
[2515.66 → 2516.62] their medium more
[2516.62 → 2517.24] because of
[2517.24 → 2518.80] x or y reason
[2518.80 → 2519.60] so
[2519.60 → 2520.50] there's no really point
[2520.50 → 2521.42] in arguing with that person
[2521.42 → 2522.32] because they like it for
[2522.32 → 2523.42] whatever preference it is
[2523.42 → 2524.24] so just
[2524.24 → 2525.14] I don't know
[2525.14 → 2526.38] let them enjoy it
[2526.38 → 2527.18] it's a video game
[2527.18 → 2529.06] we should all be happy gamers
[2529.06 → 2529.46] anyway
[2529.46 → 2530.34] but oh well
[2530.34 → 2533.62] uh
[2533.62 → 2534.48] the the the the the
[2534.48 → 2539.74] download a GeForce experience today
[2539.74 → 2540.64] it actually worked pretty good
[2540.64 → 2541.24] with my games
[2541.24 → 2542.26] I can tell a different
[2542.26 → 2542.74] difference
[2542.74 → 2543.88] that's pretty good to hear
[2543.88 → 2544.82] um
[2544.82 → 2546.62] I'm definitely going to look into
[2546.62 → 2547.76] grabbing it and trying it out
[2547.76 → 2548.56] at least so that I can
[2548.56 → 2550.16] tell people my opinion on it
[2550.16 → 2551.34] um
[2551.34 → 2552.64] but again I'm going to final scenes
[2552.64 → 2553.78] so probably after that
[2553.78 → 2554.50] I'm
[2554.50 → 2556.36] 100% sure we'll do a video on it
[2556.36 → 2557.28] when it's actually released
[2557.28 → 2558.48] we might even do a video on it
[2558.48 → 2559.08] while it's in beta
[2559.08 → 2560.26] not entirely sure
[2560.26 → 2561.98] um
[2561.98 → 2569.40] not entirely sure what you're talking about
[2569.40 → 2570.10] Kearns Null
[2570.10 → 2573.42] am I doing a video about Windows 8
[2573.42 → 2574.46] and Steam shortcuts
[2574.46 → 2578.48] I don't know
[2578.48 → 2581.36] new YouTube layout is horrible
[2581.36 → 2582.70] oh my goodness
[2582.70 → 2584.76] I don't usually like the YouTube layout changes
[2584.76 → 2585.30] um
[2585.30 → 2586.68] Facebook changes are usually alright
[2586.68 → 2588.04] but YouTube layout changes
[2588.04 → 2589.14] I've never really liked
[2589.14 → 2591.02] talking about YouTube layout changes
[2591.02 → 2593.64] how'd you get on a topic without me?
[2593.86 → 2594.38] someone asked
[2594.38 → 2595.22] someone asked?
[2595.42 → 2595.62] yep
[2595.62 → 2597.26] just because someone asked something
[2597.26 → 2597.88] now all of a sudden
[2597.88 → 2598.66] we're going to talk about it
[2598.66 → 2599.28] what do you think this is?
[2599.28 → 2600.32] some kind of Q&A session?
[2600.58 → 2600.78] yeah
[2600.78 → 2601.86] oh this is weird
[2601.86 → 2602.60] I'm on your side
[2602.60 → 2604.26] it's like
[2604.26 → 2605.82] now you look so small
[2605.82 → 2609.08] okay good
[2609.08 → 2613.26] okay not to get into
[2613.26 → 2613.82] sort of too much
[2613.82 → 2614.86] wow we look the same size
[2614.86 → 2617.08] you're so large
[2617.08 → 2619.42] not to get into too much detail
[2619.42 → 2620.32] but like have you ever
[2620.32 → 2621.50] switched sides in the bed?
[2623.08 → 2623.48] um
[2623.48 → 2623.98] yeah
[2623.98 → 2625.08] yeah it's weird right?
[2626.54 → 2627.90] no when Yvonne was pregnant
[2627.90 → 2630.02] she couldn't lay on one side
[2630.02 → 2630.50] or something
[2630.50 → 2631.86] because of like the baby
[2631.86 → 2632.46] or something
[2632.46 → 2633.84] like it makes it so it can't breathe
[2633.84 → 2634.64] or like it's heart
[2634.64 → 2635.04] something
[2635.04 → 2635.46] oh okay
[2635.46 → 2636.88] like it blocks an artery or something
[2636.88 → 2638.54] like you have to sleep a certain way
[2638.54 → 2640.22] during certain parts of the pregnancy
[2640.22 → 2642.10] I'm sorry if this is too much detail for you guys
[2642.10 → 2643.24] but um
[2643.24 → 2645.32] like we had to switch sides
[2645.32 → 2646.64] and I was just like
[2646.64 → 2648.02] sitting there in bed
[2648.02 → 2648.44] and I'm like
[2648.44 → 2649.02] whoa, whoa
[2649.02 → 2651.52] I don't understand how there are words
[2651.52 → 2653.06] okay here's another one
[2653.06 → 2653.54] have you ever
[2653.54 → 2654.82] have you ever drink from the faucet?
[2654.98 → 2656.26] like just turn it on and just drink from it?
[2656.36 → 2656.48] yeah
[2656.48 → 2656.92] okay
[2656.92 → 2658.20] pretend this is a faucet
[2658.20 → 2659.00] go ahead drink from it
[2659.00 → 2659.50] okay
[2659.50 → 2661.66] try this tonight
[2661.66 → 2663.04] put your head the other way
[2663.04 → 2666.56] I already know it's going to be weird
[2666.56 → 2667.18] oh no
[2667.18 → 2667.68] it's like
[2667.68 → 2668.72] you know how it's weird
[2668.72 → 2669.94] when you fold your hands the wrong way?
[2670.08 → 2671.38] it's ten times weirder than that
[2671.38 → 2672.18] cause you like
[2672.18 → 2672.78] you'll be like
[2672.78 → 2675.26] you won't know how to get the heart
[2675.26 → 2676.26] I swear
[2676.26 → 2678.04] go ahead you guys
[2678.04 → 2679.82] those of you watching the live stream
[2679.82 → 2682.94] maybe after we have the YouTube layout changes topic
[2682.94 → 2683.74] discussion
[2683.74 → 2685.06] but go try this
[2685.06 → 2686.22] go find a sink
[2686.22 → 2687.44] and put your head the wrong way
[2687.44 → 2688.34] because it's ridiculous
[2688.34 → 2690.34] okay
[2690.34 → 2690.84] let's
[2690.84 → 2693.44] how far have you gotten into YouTube layout changes?
[2693.60 → 2694.22] I just started
[2694.22 → 2695.06] okay just started
[2695.06 → 2696.18] YouTube layout changes
[2696.18 → 2698.04] are the most ridiculous thing ever
[2698.04 → 2699.32] and I'm going to show you why
[2699.32 → 2700.20] tunnel
[2700.20 → 2701.16] infinite tunnel
[2701.16 → 2702.76] yeah I'm sorry for that you guys
[2702.76 → 2703.30] uh
[2703.30 → 2703.78] oh right
[2703.78 → 2704.64] no that's not what to do
[2704.64 → 2708.34] I understand why this isn't working
[2708.34 → 2709.72] there we go
[2709.72 → 2710.80] alright so
[2710.80 → 2712.72] number one
[2712.72 → 2712.94] you don't even sign in
[2712.94 → 2713.58] you don't even sign in
[2713.58 → 2714.44] oh I'm not signed in
[2714.44 → 2716.38] you have to be signed in for it to be as horrible as it is
[2716.38 → 2717.30] well it's still horrible
[2717.30 → 2717.82] oh I know
[2717.82 → 2721.94] I love how my 24-inch monitor has all this blank space here
[2721.94 → 2723.74] which is flipping brilliant
[2723.74 → 2725.10] and uh
[2725.10 → 2727.16] oh what account am I going to be able to sign in to?
[2727.28 → 2728.40] yeah they justify left
[2728.40 → 2731.36] they just like shove everything lay off into the left
[2731.36 → 2732.72] uh
[2732.72 → 2733.84] I don't think
[2733.84 → 2734.60] uh
[2734.60 → 2736.56] I think I have two-step on this
[2736.56 → 2739.78] I don't care if they email me here
[2739.78 → 2741.04] I'm just going to ignore it you guys
[2741.04 → 2741.62] just so you know
[2741.62 → 2743.02] I will not read your email
[2743.02 → 2744.88] I don't even check this email
[2744.88 → 2747.04] actually going back to our multiple emails' thing
[2747.04 → 2747.42] yeah
[2747.42 → 2748.94] I use this email once
[2748.94 → 2750.30] for like contest submissions
[2750.30 → 2752.80] and he doesn't even push emails to a different email
[2752.80 → 2754.28] so he will legitimately not get that
[2754.28 → 2756.60] yeah I actually legit won't get it
[2756.60 → 2759.14] you know what's actually really cool
[2759.14 → 2760.46] if you want to throw away email address
[2760.46 → 2761.48] that actually will work
[2761.48 → 2763.44] like you can register on websites with it and stuff
[2763.44 → 2764.44] um
[2764.44 → 2765.16] not
[2765.16 → 2767.28] go to not sharing my dot info
[2767.28 → 2768.20] it's an actual
[2768.20 → 2769.20] website
[2769.20 → 2771.34] and you can sign up for email accounts that are
[2771.34 → 2772.82] some random username
[2772.82 → 2774.92] at not sharing my dot info
[2774.92 → 2776.78] and they're legitimate email accounts
[2776.78 → 2777.62] so you can use them for like
[2777.62 → 2778.70] oh you might have a problem
[2778.70 → 2781.00] oh never mind it's okay
[2781.00 → 2784.44] because I was thinking maybe that was why this wasn't working
[2784.44 → 2787.20] because I'm pretty sure
[2787.20 → 2789.80] I'm pretty sure I'm entering the right password here
[2793.44 → 2795.16] what the heck
[2795.16 → 2798.18] oh I entered the wrong username
[2798.18 → 2800.44] her deep
[2800.44 → 2805.06] there we go
[2805.06 → 2807.32] if you're tuning in now
[2807.32 → 2809.24] we'll be talking about YouTube UI
[2809.24 → 2809.98] very soon
[2809.98 → 2811.04] yeah very soon
[2811.04 → 2811.74] as soon as
[2811.74 → 2812.66] here
[2812.66 → 2814.40] let me go get that code
[2814.40 → 2815.02] in the meantime
[2815.02 → 2815.72] you entertain
[2815.72 → 2816.66] do a dance or something
[2816.66 → 2817.56] I've no
[2817.56 → 2819.00] I'll pass
[2819.00 → 2820.38] same
[2820.38 → 2821.32] no
[2821.32 → 2823.88] twitter
[2823.88 → 2825.72] one second guys
[2825.72 → 2826.22] sorry
[2826.22 → 2830.72] I'm drinking both sides depending on where I am
[2830.72 → 2831.86] oh I should probably move
[2831.86 → 2834.30] hello
[2834.30 → 2835.66] you're back already
[2835.66 → 2836.34] yeah I'm back already
[2836.34 → 2836.84] yeah I'm good
[2836.84 → 2838.82] why do you keep taking my chair
[2838.82 → 2839.70] because I
[2839.70 → 2841.84] like you're some kind of homeless person
[2841.84 → 2845.60] and all I have to do is move away from my house for like two seconds, and you like to take it
[2845.60 → 2847.52] imagine people just stole houses
[2847.52 → 2849.84] that would actually
[2849.84 → 2851.70] that's the smartest thing ever
[2851.70 → 2853.40] why do we even make YouTube videos
[2853.40 → 2854.56] let's just steal houses
[2854.56 → 2855.20] yeah
[2855.20 → 2856.80] just flip houses that we steal
[2856.80 → 2857.34] yeah
[2857.34 → 2858.46] sounds legit
[2858.46 → 2860.78] uh okay
[2860.78 → 2862.46] switch again
[2862.46 → 2863.10] because this is weird
[2863.10 → 2864.94] it feels like I just switched sides in the bed with you
[2864.94 → 2866.40] okay
[2866.40 → 2867.60] back to uh
[2867.60 → 2869.64] back to why the YouTube is horrible now
[2869.64 → 2872.68] alright
[2872.68 → 2874.00] sweet
[2874.00 → 2874.96] there we go
[2874.96 → 2876.06] let me just check on Twitch
[2876.06 → 2876.90] make sure we got the
[2876.90 → 2877.52] our uh
[2877.52 → 2878.08] on play
[2878.08 → 2878.66] alright
[2878.66 → 2879.28] so
[2879.28 → 2880.44] what's horrible about this
[2880.44 → 2881.06] number of things
[2881.06 → 2881.98] so now that I'm signed in
[2881.98 → 2883.96] you can see there's actually more blank space here
[2883.96 → 2884.98] which is amazing
[2884.98 → 2886.82] I love what to watch
[2886.82 → 2888.52] I actually went through this earlier today
[2888.52 → 2889.26] so
[2889.26 → 2890.70] it's got my other channel
[2890.70 → 2891.92] it's got something from Logan
[2891.92 → 2892.72] which is fine
[2892.72 → 2893.50] I got no problem with that
[2893.50 → 2894.72] it has some old video
[2894.72 → 2895.32] from Logan
[2895.32 → 2896.44] which is like
[2896.44 → 2897.66] this is a couple of months old
[2897.66 → 2898.10] at this point
[2898.10 → 2898.68] I'm like okay
[2898.68 → 2900.48] how is this at the very top of my feed
[2900.48 → 2901.80] um
[2901.80 → 2903.10] there was some other stupid stuff
[2903.10 → 2903.76] check this out
[2903.76 → 2905.60] my own video
[2905.60 → 2907.82] recommended for me
[2907.82 → 2911.18] my own video
[2911.18 → 2914.32] I mean you were in it
[2914.32 → 2914.74] like
[2914.74 → 2915.78] guys
[2915.78 → 2916.62] it's actually hilarious
[2916.62 → 2917.54] I turned it to them on
[2917.54 → 2918.24] guys
[2918.24 → 2919.92] my own video
[2919.92 → 2920.88] recommended for me
[2920.88 → 2921.88] brilliant right
[2921.88 → 2924.12] it's sort of your video too
[2924.12 → 2924.72] you were in it
[2924.72 → 2924.96] but
[2924.96 → 2926.68] ridiculous
[2926.68 → 2927.16] okay
[2927.16 → 2927.90] so let's keep going
[2927.90 → 2929.54] like I actually spent a fair bit of time
[2929.54 → 2930.34] playing with this today
[2930.34 → 2931.18] prepping this topic
[2931.18 → 2932.04] because it's just
[2932.04 → 2932.84] ridiculous
[2932.84 → 2933.84] so
[2933.84 → 2934.36] you know
[2934.36 → 2935.70] channels that I have
[2935.70 → 2937.20] as like my recommended channels
[2937.20 → 2938.26] so it's kind of like
[2938.26 → 2939.68] yeah I'm aware of this channel already
[2939.68 → 2939.98] like
[2939.98 → 2941.00] like I know about
[2941.00 → 2941.80] Linus Cat Tips
[2941.80 → 2942.54] but thank you
[2942.54 → 2943.76] um
[2943.76 → 2944.48] wait
[2944.48 → 2945.24] wrong thing
[2945.24 → 2945.54] there
[2945.54 → 2946.36] I hope
[2946.36 → 2947.00] ah shoot
[2947.00 → 2948.00] see I can't
[2948.00 → 2948.32] uh
[2948.32 → 2949.26] I can't monitor
[2949.26 → 2951.08] I can't monitor XSplit
[2951.08 → 2951.52] when we're
[2951.52 → 2951.96] there we go
[2951.96 → 2952.84] we should get a second monitor
[2952.84 → 2953.36] I know
[2953.36 → 2954.04] I know
[2954.04 → 2954.80] we totally need one
[2954.80 → 2956.20] okay, so there are some badminton videos
[2956.20 → 2956.82] that's fine
[2956.82 → 2958.50] but I'm subscribed to that
[2958.50 → 2959.30] and check this out
[2959.30 → 2961.16] 10 months ago
[2961.16 → 2962.16] this video is from
[2962.16 → 2962.74] wow
[2962.74 → 2963.86] this is in the top
[2963.86 → 2965.48] of my what I should watch feed
[2965.48 → 2967.42] like is it paying attention at all
[2967.42 → 2969.58] some NCI X Tech Tips thing
[2969.58 → 2971.40] it's got stuff I've watched already
[2971.40 → 2973.44] it knows I've watched it
[2973.44 → 2974.68] and it's from
[2974.68 → 2975.56] two days ago
[2975.56 → 2977.04] and it's apparently way down here
[2977.04 → 2978.28] and something
[2978.28 → 2979.54] um
[2979.54 → 2980.22] so yeah
[2980.22 → 2981.50] I think the worst part
[2981.50 → 2982.62] is recommending me
[2982.62 → 2983.70] to watch my own video
[2983.70 → 2984.04] okay
[2984.04 → 2985.26] my least favourite thing
[2985.26 → 2985.68] okay
[2985.68 → 2987.30] if you look on the left here
[2987.30 → 2988.00] my subscriptions
[2988.00 → 2988.48] yes
[2988.48 → 2989.64] if you go there
[2989.64 → 2991.38] and then you check
[2991.38 → 2991.98] where is it
[2991.98 → 2992.82] uploads only
[2992.82 → 2994.12] okay
[2994.12 → 2996.00] it's already two full loads
[2996.00 → 2996.82] that I have to go through
[2996.82 → 2997.92] and then if
[2997.92 → 2999.58] not now because audio issues
[2999.58 → 2999.90] and whatnot
[2999.90 → 3001.20] if you click on a video
[3001.20 → 3002.54] and then go back
[3002.54 → 3004.24] it loses this preference
[3004.24 → 3005.66] and you have to click on
[3005.66 → 3006.22] my subscriptions
[3006.22 → 3006.78] well here let's do it
[3006.78 → 3007.24] yeah we'll do it
[3007.24 → 3008.78] okay so we go back
[3008.78 → 3010.34] unless they already fixed it
[3010.34 → 3011.64] unless they already fixed that
[3011.64 → 3012.16] hold on
[3012.16 → 3013.58] my subscriptions
[3013.58 → 3014.18] uploads only
[3014.18 → 3015.40] so they must have already fixed it
[3015.40 → 3015.70] okay
[3015.70 → 3016.54] I did that like immediately
[3016.54 → 3017.26] on rollout
[3017.26 → 3018.18] ah
[3018.18 → 3020.02] okay, okay hold on
[3020.02 → 3020.42] I've got
[3020.42 → 3021.20] I've got some good ones
[3021.20 → 3021.90] I've got some good ones
[3021.90 → 3022.06] okay
[3022.06 → 3023.42] so when you go to the homepage
[3023.42 → 3026.08] where's the
[3026.08 → 3027.60] where's the viral videos
[3027.60 → 3029.12] oh there you go
[3029.12 → 3030.42] see this is my homepage
[3030.42 → 3030.90] there you go
[3030.90 → 3031.52] if you go to the homepage
[3031.52 → 3032.82] where
[3032.82 → 3034.64] so you have to go
[3034.64 → 3035.06] like
[3035.06 → 3035.88] I don't know
[3035.88 → 3036.78] okay so where
[3036.78 → 3039.06] where are my viral videos
[3039.06 → 3039.34] you guys
[3039.34 → 3040.72] like where's the Ray William Johnson
[3040.72 → 3041.74] video that's hot today
[3041.74 → 3042.92] where's the
[3042.92 → 3043.44] you know
[3043.44 → 3044.24] video about
[3044.24 → 3045.26] some world event
[3045.26 → 3045.98] that's going on
[3045.98 → 3046.38] that's
[3046.38 → 3047.32] that's hot today
[3047.32 → 3047.76] that's trending
[3047.76 → 3048.92] it's because the default menu
[3048.92 → 3049.92] is not my subscriptions
[3049.92 → 3050.96] and the default menu
[3050.96 → 3051.54] is not
[3051.54 → 3052.28] even than
[3052.28 → 3053.94] even if it was my subscriptions
[3053.94 → 3055.12] that's terrible too
[3055.12 → 3056.12] because what if it's a channel
[3056.12 → 3057.18] I'm not subscribed to
[3057.18 → 3058.54] what if I just want to see
[3058.54 → 3059.36] what's hot on YouTube
[3059.36 → 3059.92] right now
[3059.92 → 3061.88] oh, oh and recommended channels
[3061.88 → 3062.44] this is great
[3062.44 → 3064.10] so my top recommended channel
[3064.10 → 3064.86] is gay penis
[3064.86 → 3066.84] which I clicked on
[3066.84 → 3068.20] just because I was curious
[3068.20 → 3069.88] why is this recommended for me
[3069.88 → 3071.24] he has one video
[3071.24 → 3072.48] called ear rape
[3072.48 → 3073.54] and it's just like
[3073.54 → 3074.64] a horrible noise
[3074.64 → 3075.54] and I'm like
[3075.54 → 3075.94] why would
[3075.94 → 3076.90] doesn't he only have
[3076.90 → 3078.60] 674 subscribers
[3078.60 → 3078.90] yes
[3078.90 → 3080.74] so how did that possibly
[3080.74 → 3080.98] do
[3080.98 → 3081.12] okay
[3081.12 → 3082.42] then there's my own channel
[3082.42 → 3084.08] then there's
[3084.08 → 3084.80] something
[3084.80 → 3085.94] I don't know what this is
[3085.94 → 3086.44] Tim Minchin
[3086.44 → 3087.74] I've watched a bunch of his videos
[3087.74 → 3089.64] so that one's the one legit one
[3089.64 → 3090.72] tech of tomorrow
[3090.72 → 3091.10] okay
[3091.10 → 3091.62] legit
[3091.62 → 3092.48] I'm a tech guy
[3092.48 → 3092.72] so
[3092.72 → 3094.28] and then Verbal Space Program
[3094.28 → 3095.38] which it's like
[3095.38 → 3096.36] irrelevant
[3096.36 → 3097.58] it's that stupid game
[3097.58 → 3098.36] that like you
[3098.36 → 3099.60] make the Verbal Space Program
[3099.60 → 3099.76] yeah
[3099.76 → 3101.84] so okay
[3101.84 → 3102.08] okay
[3102.08 → 3102.36] okay
[3102.36 → 3102.90] so there's that
[3102.90 → 3103.28] there's that
[3103.28 → 3104.06] now get this
[3104.06 → 3105.18] so then there's my subscriptions
[3105.18 → 3106.50] which seems to be broken too
[3106.50 → 3107.66] because it's not
[3107.66 → 3109.52] all the latest ones
[3109.52 → 3110.48] like I'm pretty sure
[3110.48 → 3112.20] New egg TV has had more stuff
[3112.20 → 3112.96] in the last two days
[3112.96 → 3113.40] than that
[3113.40 → 3116.20] okay
[3116.20 → 3117.66] so fine
[3117.66 → 3118.58] social
[3118.58 → 3119.26] get this
[3119.26 → 3121.02] so this is the most blatant
[3121.02 → 3122.52] horrible integration
[3122.52 → 3123.88] of Google Plus
[3123.88 → 3125.14] that I've yet seen
[3125.14 → 3127.56] like Gmail doesn't have anything like this
[3127.56 → 3129.30] what the heck is this
[3129.30 → 3132.18] like what is this
[3132.18 → 3133.18] I haven't looked at it
[3133.18 → 3134.18] no it's terrible
[3134.18 → 3135.68] basically it's just
[3135.68 → 3137.60] random like Google Plus
[3137.60 → 3138.06] crap
[3138.06 → 3139.66] that if I really wanted to know
[3139.66 → 3141.54] if someone on my Google Plus
[3141.54 → 3143.16] liked something
[3143.16 → 3144.22] on Google Plus
[3144.22 → 3144.82] on YouTube
[3144.82 → 3146.80] I would go to Google Plus
[3146.80 → 3147.64] and I would look at that
[3147.64 → 3148.08] like
[3148.08 → 3149.08] this is just
[3149.08 → 3150.32] just blatant
[3150.32 → 3151.78] just blatant
[3151.78 → 3152.76] integration of
[3152.76 → 3153.92] something nobody wants
[3153.92 → 3155.56] into something that everyone wants
[3155.56 → 3156.96] and I mean
[3156.96 → 3158.14] I understand why they're doing it
[3158.14 → 3158.38] but
[3158.38 → 3159.02] well it's
[3159.02 → 3160.72] it's buried in a sub menu though
[3160.72 → 3161.16] yes
[3161.16 → 3162.76] so at least it doesn't bug you
[3162.76 → 3163.18] meanwhile
[3163.18 → 3164.60] there's fundamental stuff
[3164.60 → 3165.32] that's still broken
[3165.32 → 3166.38] this kills me
[3166.38 → 3167.04] this is why
[3167.04 → 3167.32] guys
[3167.32 → 3169.32] this is why I hate YouTube PMs
[3169.32 → 3170.12] so check this out
[3170.12 → 3171.74] this is how many PMs I get
[3171.74 → 3173.88] this is going back to the fifth
[3173.88 → 3175.04] so in the last two days
[3175.04 → 3176.24] I've gotten this many PMs
[3176.24 → 3177.52] which is
[3177.52 → 3179.46] worse when I'm replying to them
[3179.46 → 3180.38] like when I reply to them
[3180.38 → 3181.18] they come in really fast
[3181.18 → 3182.76] we're all the way back to the fourth now
[3182.76 → 3184.44] so a hundred PMs
[3184.44 → 3185.22] in the last sort of
[3185.22 → 3186.16] four or five days
[3186.16 → 3188.30] that plus Twitter
[3188.30 → 3189.24] plus email
[3189.24 → 3190.56] plus everything
[3190.56 → 3191.48] it just adds up
[3191.48 → 3193.44] so this is what I hate about this
[3193.44 → 3193.90] remember
[3193.90 → 3195.58] this is the company that brought you Gmail
[3195.58 → 3197.62] the conversation based
[3197.62 → 3199.18] email thread thing
[3199.18 → 3199.78] okay
[3199.78 → 3202.22] why is it
[3202.22 → 3202.62] that here
[3202.62 → 3203.40] I'm going to find something
[3203.40 → 3204.16] that's a reply
[3204.16 → 3204.82] here
[3204.82 → 3206.32] why does this not have
[3206.32 → 3207.84] any other information in it
[3207.84 → 3209.52] you can't expand
[3209.52 → 3210.52] you can't view
[3210.52 → 3211.90] other messages or anything
[3211.90 → 3212.70] so guys
[3212.70 → 3214.52] don't message me
[3214.52 → 3215.36] on YouTube
[3215.36 → 3217.22] do not do it
[3217.22 → 3218.58] because what happens
[3218.58 → 3219.70] is I might reply to you
[3219.70 → 3220.96] and you'll say something like
[3220.96 → 3221.86] hey Linus
[3221.86 → 3223.12] here's my configuration
[3223.12 → 3224.54] what video card should I get
[3224.54 → 3225.66] to which I will reply
[3225.66 → 3227.92] 7770 for example
[3227.92 → 3229.88] and then you'll reply to me
[3229.88 → 3230.98] a few days later
[3230.98 → 3231.44] remember
[3231.44 → 3232.96] I've read another 80
[3232.96 → 3235.02] YouTube messages alone by then
[3235.02 → 3236.02] let alone
[3236.02 → 3237.12] with something like
[3237.12 → 3237.86] thousand Twitter messages
[3237.86 → 3238.70] and whatever else
[3238.70 → 3240.52] but is my power supply enough for that
[3240.52 → 3241.30] and I'll be like
[3241.30 → 3241.70] guy
[3241.70 → 3243.64] I have no idea what you're asking me
[3243.64 → 3245.66] I have no idea what power supply you have me
[3245.66 → 3247.80] so then I have to send back another message
[3247.80 → 3249.22] typing out
[3249.22 → 3250.14] explaining
[3250.14 → 3252.36] that I'm not going to be able to help you
[3252.36 → 3254.46] and then you have to send me another message
[3254.46 → 3255.08] and all of a sudden
[3255.08 → 3256.36] this is why we need a forum
[3256.36 → 3258.12] like then I'm just going to send
[3258.12 → 3260.20] like a copy and paste reply
[3260.20 → 3261.42] to everyone who messages me
[3261.42 → 3261.92] join the forum
[3261.92 → 3262.50] join the forum
[3262.50 → 3263.04] join the forum
[3263.04 → 3265.32] because I can't manage this
[3265.32 → 3266.94] like it's totally impossible
[3266.94 → 3268.86] and I think I just messed up
[3268.86 → 3269.20] but nope
[3269.20 → 3269.68] there we go
[3269.68 → 3270.48] by the way
[3270.48 → 3271.24] forum's coming
[3271.24 → 3272.96] I need to at least
[3272.96 → 3274.16] like finish finals first
[3274.16 → 3275.88] which are coming up soon
[3275.88 → 3277.18] once I finish finals
[3277.18 → 3277.98] work on the forum
[3277.98 → 3279.04] we'll start up again
[3279.04 → 3279.70] okay
[3279.70 → 3280.60] so meanwhile
[3280.60 → 3282.66] they're not even fixing fundamental stuff
[3282.66 → 3284.68] like how broken private messaging is
[3284.68 → 3285.42] oh yeah
[3285.42 → 3286.42] here's another good one
[3286.42 → 3287.16] this is
[3287.16 → 3288.26] this is frigging awesome
[3288.26 → 3290.84] so I think I have to go back to messages
[3290.84 → 3292.30] ah yes
[3292.30 → 3293.98] contact notifications
[3293.98 → 3295.10] I have 1500 of them
[3295.10 → 3295.70] watch what happens
[3295.70 → 3297.26] if I actually try to accept them
[3297.26 → 3300.70] it only adds that little bit
[3300.70 → 3302.52] yeah it adds like two or three or something
[3302.52 → 3303.58] and it's like
[3303.58 → 3304.10] great
[3304.10 → 3304.80] thanks for that
[3304.80 → 3305.66] so that's broken
[3305.66 → 3306.40] comments
[3306.40 → 3307.84] shows me only a small fraction
[3307.84 → 3308.82] of the actual comments
[3308.82 → 3309.86] that get posted on my video
[3309.86 → 3310.82] which is fine I guess
[3310.82 → 3311.30] because
[3311.30 → 3313.86] it's unmanageable anyway
[3313.86 → 3315.38] shared with you
[3315.38 → 3316.52] I totally ignore those
[3316.52 → 3318.28] yeah
[3318.28 → 3319.34] so ridiculous
[3319.34 → 3320.56] okay so back to the homepage
[3320.56 → 3321.96] back to other things that are wrong
[3321.96 → 3323.68] ah
[3323.68 → 3324.48] watch later
[3324.48 → 3325.00] watch history
[3325.00 → 3325.22] right
[3325.22 → 3326.72] so I can't find anything viral
[3326.72 → 3327.72] social I would have thought
[3327.72 → 3328.82] would have been like viral stuff
[3328.82 → 3330.10] manage subscriptions is fine
[3330.10 → 3331.34] browse channels
[3331.34 → 3332.42] this is the kicker
[3332.42 → 3333.98] and this is where it went
[3333.98 → 3334.84] from being annoyed
[3334.84 → 3336.46] to being mad
[3336.46 → 3337.16] like
[3337.16 → 3337.84] okay here
[3337.84 → 3339.94] I cannot emphasize enough
[3339.94 → 3341.02] how mad I am about
[3341.02 → 3342.78] what you guys are about to see
[3342.78 → 3343.52] so get this
[3343.52 → 3345.68] so we've got a bunch of different topics
[3345.68 → 3347.00] it's always been sorted by topic
[3347.00 → 3347.34] and it
[3347.34 → 3349.26] I mean do you remember when there used to be awards
[3349.26 → 3351.06] like there was like top 10 in Canada
[3351.06 → 3351.60] or top
[3351.60 → 3352.22] that was really cool
[3352.22 → 3353.26] those were really cool
[3353.26 → 3353.86] I liked those
[3353.86 → 3354.86] because I always won them
[3354.86 → 3356.46] but they were never accurate
[3356.46 → 3357.30] so I don't know if I
[3357.30 → 3358.50] ever legit
[3358.50 → 3359.34] actually won them
[3359.34 → 3361.16] like I was number one most viewed in Canada once
[3361.16 → 3361.94] and there's no way
[3361.94 → 3363.72] like there's just no way
[3363.72 → 3367.04] okay so we got recommended for you
[3367.04 → 3367.90] we got animation
[3367.90 → 3368.56] automotive
[3368.56 → 3369.20] beauty and fashion
[3369.20 → 3369.86] oh really
[3369.86 → 3371.00] no way
[3371.00 → 3372.36] this is in alphabetical order
[3372.36 → 3374.94] that is the worst way of sorting things ever
[3374.94 → 3377.56] oh I didn't even notice that before
[3377.56 → 3379.10] that's terrible
[3379.10 → 3380.58] oh
[3380.58 → 3381.44] okay
[3381.44 → 3382.30] so top gear
[3382.30 → 3382.86] motor train
[3382.86 → 3383.44] car and driver
[3383.44 → 3383.88] these are all
[3383.88 → 3384.64] these all make sense
[3384.64 → 3385.28] beauty and fashion
[3385.28 → 3387.14] I have no idea which ones are the good ones
[3387.14 → 3388.62] celebrities and gossip
[3388.62 → 3390.32] okay so we got Ray William Johnson there
[3390.32 → 3391.66] film and entertainment
[3391.66 → 3393.36] we got Ray William Johnson there
[3393.36 → 3394.92] loss and internet
[3394.92 → 3396.46] we got Ray William Johnson
[3396.46 → 3399.50] what category is he not in
[3399.50 → 3400.96] okay, so there's that
[3400.96 → 3401.98] now get this
[3401.98 → 3403.04] uh
[3403.04 → 3405.30] comedy doesn't have Ray William Johnson for some reason
[3405.30 → 3406.64] but does have epic meal time
[3406.64 → 3408.30] which I would argue is not really very funny
[3408.30 → 3409.94] but is definitely cooking
[3409.94 → 3411.22] and definitely not health
[3411.22 → 3413.20] okay, so there's that
[3413.20 → 3414.56] um
[3414.56 → 3417.90] there were some glaring omissions that I noticed
[3417.90 → 3418.90] from TV
[3418.90 → 3419.26] gaming
[3419.26 → 3420.74] where is PewDiePie
[3420.74 → 3423.08] isn't he the most
[3423.08 → 3424.54] like biggest person on YouTube
[3424.54 → 3426.90] he is number 10
[3426.90 → 3428.70] for most subscribed on YouTube
[3428.70 → 3430.10] he is number 2
[3430.10 → 3431.18] for the gaming category
[3431.18 → 3433.02] behind only Machining at this point
[3433.02 → 3433.44] oh okay
[3433.44 → 3434.36] he is the fastest
[3434.36 → 3435.12] I mean okay
[3435.12 → 3435.48] like
[3435.48 → 3437.36] I can't watch his videos
[3437.36 → 3438.18] let me make that clear
[3438.18 → 3438.86] I'm not a bro
[3438.86 → 3439.74] ugh
[3439.74 → 3440.12] okay
[3440.12 → 3440.76] not a bro
[3440.76 → 3441.22] ugh
[3441.22 → 3442.24] I hate them
[3442.24 → 3442.84] however
[3442.84 → 3444.88] you can't argue with results
[3444.88 → 3447.18] he is the fastest growing channel on YouTube
[3447.18 → 3448.54] even bigger than
[3448.54 → 3448.82] uh
[3448.82 → 3449.18] what's her name
[3449.18 → 3449.74] Jenna Marbles
[3449.74 → 3451.16] who is number 2 right now
[3451.16 → 3452.62] and
[3452.62 → 3453.78] somehow
[3453.78 → 3456.52] YouTube has overlooked him in the gaming category
[3456.52 → 3457.78] where is he exactly?
[3457.78 → 3459.18] there are channels here
[3459.18 → 3460.52] that have literally
[3460.52 → 3462.04] one quarter
[3462.04 → 3463.16] to one eighth
[3463.16 → 3464.66] as many subscribers as he does
[3464.66 → 3466.50] daily views for him
[3466.50 → 3468.16] is in the millions
[3468.16 → 3471.02] like 4 or 5 million views per day
[3471.02 → 3472.16] and somehow
[3472.16 → 3473.06] he is not a top
[3473.06 → 3474.30] featured gaming channel
[3474.30 → 3474.60] let's say
[3474.60 → 3474.90] it is like
[3474.90 → 3475.34] okay
[3475.34 → 3477.28] that makes a lot of sense
[3477.28 → 3478.24] um
[3478.24 → 3478.72] music
[3478.72 → 3479.52] okay
[3479.52 → 3481.10] you can say whatever you want
[3481.10 → 3482.00] about Justin Bieber
[3482.00 → 3482.96] and
[3482.96 → 3484.16] where are they?
[3484.24 → 3484.76] but he should be there
[3484.76 → 3486.18] but he should be there
[3486.18 → 3487.86] he is the number one music channel
[3487.86 → 3488.98] behind Universal Music
[3488.98 → 3490.62] like I actually pay attention
[3490.62 → 3491.18] to this stuff
[3491.18 → 3492.84] where is Justin Bieber here?
[3493.26 → 3493.96] not there
[3493.96 → 3495.06] um
[3495.06 → 3495.62] okay
[3495.62 → 3496.78] now this is the part
[3496.78 → 3497.06] that
[3497.06 → 3497.76] okay here here here
[3497.76 → 3498.30] get this
[3498.30 → 3498.70] okay so
[3498.70 → 3499.84] it should be noted
[3499.84 → 3501.22] that I'm on location Canada
[3501.22 → 3502.84] and the results change a little bit
[3502.84 → 3503.58] if I go to worldwide
[3503.58 → 3505.00] here's another glaring omission
[3505.00 → 3506.10] where is the USA?
[3507.10 → 3507.54] what?
[3508.92 → 3511.54] you cannot manually select USA
[3511.54 → 3512.44] as a location
[3512.44 → 3514.92] no it's not there
[3514.92 → 3515.44] trust me
[3515.44 → 3517.04] it is not there
[3517.04 → 3519.76] okay so let's go worldwide
[3519.76 → 3520.80] just for loss
[3520.80 → 3523.16] actually
[3523.16 → 3523.72] oh no
[3523.72 → 3524.04] no, no
[3524.04 → 3524.44] hold on
[3524.44 → 3524.80] oh shoot
[3524.80 → 3525.08] no, no
[3525.08 → 3525.56] let's go back
[3525.56 → 3526.36] I want to stay
[3526.36 → 3527.60] I want to stay Canada for now
[3527.60 → 3528.40] sorry guys
[3528.40 → 3528.80] trust me
[3528.80 → 3529.78] I'm going somewhere with this
[3529.78 → 3530.92] I'm getting to the part
[3530.92 → 3531.66] that made me mad
[3531.66 → 3532.08] soon
[3532.08 → 3534.04] okay Canada
[3534.04 → 3535.50] uh
[3535.50 → 3536.22] here
[3536.22 → 3536.98] so back to Canada
[3536.98 → 3537.48] alright
[3537.48 → 3538.04] so
[3538.04 → 3538.94] so we've established
[3538.94 → 3539.86] that there seem to be
[3539.86 → 3540.66] some omissions
[3540.66 → 3541.90] in terms of the rankings
[3541.90 → 3542.28] of things
[3542.28 → 3543.54] so let's go back to
[3543.54 → 3544.22] ah tech
[3544.22 → 3545.22] so
[3545.22 → 3546.84] I'm not here
[3546.84 → 3547.92] I can swallow that
[3547.92 → 3548.28] I guess
[3548.28 → 3549.54] although this creators project
[3549.54 → 3551.44] thing with 43,000 subscribers
[3551.44 → 3552.52] seems kind of
[3552.52 → 3552.98] sort of
[3552.98 → 3554.22] like it doesn't need to be there
[3554.22 → 3556.24] okay, so I'm
[3556.24 → 3557.12] location Canada
[3557.12 → 3557.70] where am I
[3557.70 → 3561.56] where am I
[3561.56 → 3561.80] slick
[3561.80 → 3562.68] I just
[3562.68 → 3563.94] I'm not there
[3563.94 → 3564.56] I didn't know
[3564.56 → 3565.52] technical was Canada
[3565.52 → 3567.34] I don't think any of these
[3567.34 → 3567.88] things are Canada
[3567.88 → 3568.74] I noticed all of
[3568.74 → 3569.70] Google's channels are here
[3569.70 → 3570.98] Justine is very
[3570.98 → 3572.38] definitely not Canada
[3572.38 → 3573.48] very definitely not Canada
[3573.48 → 3574.02] very definitely
[3574.02 → 3574.68] soldier knows best
[3574.68 → 3575.22] is not
[3575.22 → 3576.52] very definitely not Canada
[3576.52 → 3576.88] indeed
[3576.88 → 3577.52] um
[3577.52 → 3578.44] you know what else is missing
[3578.44 → 3579.64] so they've got HTC
[3579.64 → 3580.52] where's Samsung Mobile
[3580.52 → 3584.12] we've got Newegg.com
[3584.12 → 3585.12] which is clearly
[3585.12 → 3585.88] not Canada
[3585.88 → 3587.42] so you could make the argument
[3587.42 → 3587.70] okay
[3587.70 → 3588.66] so one of the things
[3588.66 → 3589.52] that was suggested to me
[3589.52 → 3590.34] was well Linus
[3590.34 → 3591.96] you're logged in as yourself
[3591.96 → 3593.24] obviously
[3593.24 → 3594.50] it's not there
[3594.50 → 3594.96] and I went
[3594.96 → 3595.32] okay
[3595.32 → 3597.24] where's Sitcom
[3597.24 → 3599.64] where's the other channel
[3599.64 → 3600.20] I maintain
[3600.20 → 3600.54] the other channel
[3600.54 → 3601.38] but I am clearly
[3601.38 → 3602.10] not
[3602.10 → 3603.86] logged in as
[3603.86 → 3604.88] and like
[3604.88 → 3605.74] you can say
[3605.74 → 3606.78] oh you're just complaining
[3606.78 → 3607.38] about your own thing
[3607.38 → 3608.84] but there's a billion people
[3608.84 → 3609.02] here
[3609.02 → 3610.40] okay there are guys with like
[3610.40 → 3612.66] 39,000 subscribers here
[3612.66 → 3613.40] 39,000
[3613.40 → 3614.12] 41,000
[3614.12 → 3614.96] I mean there was one
[3614.96 → 3615.72] that I was looking at
[3615.72 → 3616.88] I forget which one it was
[3616.88 → 3617.94] um
[3617.94 → 3618.72] shoot
[3618.72 → 3619.62] I don't even remember
[3619.62 → 3621.44] but it was one that's getting like
[3621.44 → 3622.66] like a thousand views a day
[3622.66 → 3623.64] like we're talking a channel
[3623.64 → 3625.12] that is one hundredth the size
[3625.12 → 3625.94] of what I'm doing
[3625.94 → 3627.26] on one of my channels alone
[3627.26 → 3629.16] so about one two hundredth
[3629.16 → 3630.04] of what they're doing together
[3630.04 → 3630.82] so I'm like
[3630.82 → 3631.40] okay where am I
[3631.40 → 3631.94] so I kind of went
[3631.94 → 3632.34] okay
[3632.34 → 3634.22] well they've clearly got the regions
[3634.22 → 3634.96] all mixed up
[3634.96 → 3635.80] so let's go ahead
[3635.80 → 3637.20] and change to location worldwide
[3637.20 → 3637.72] shall we
[3637.72 → 3640.50] so this is how broken this is
[3640.50 → 3641.52] where's Justin Bieber
[3641.52 → 3642.78] where is
[3642.78 → 3644.98] like where's PewDiePie
[3644.98 → 3646.36] they're in there by the way
[3646.36 → 3647.30] so now
[3647.30 → 3647.94] where am I
[3647.94 → 3649.46] oh
[3649.46 → 3650.80] still not there
[3650.80 → 3652.14] we have stuff in here
[3652.14 → 3653.58] with 5,000 subscribers
[3653.58 → 3655.38] there's a channel called
[3655.38 → 3656.82] Samsung Galaxy S2
[3656.82 → 3658.42] with 5,000 subscribers
[3658.42 → 3659.04] it's in here
[3659.04 → 3661.04] 7,000
[3661.04 → 3661.82] yes
[3661.82 → 3663.64] there are incredibly small channels
[3663.64 → 3664.18] neither
[3664.18 → 3665.16] Minus Tech Tips
[3665.16 → 3666.56] nor Sitcom
[3666.56 → 3667.28] are in here
[3667.28 → 3669.72] that's crazy
[3669.72 → 3670.54] isn't it
[3670.54 → 3672.50] so I actually sent an email
[3672.50 → 3673.44] to partner support today
[3673.44 → 3674.06] I was just like
[3674.06 → 3675.14] oh guys
[3675.14 → 3676.54] I couldn't help noticing
[3676.54 → 3678.16] that I've been a YouTube partner
[3678.16 → 3678.74] for like
[3678.74 → 3679.84] you know
[3679.84 → 3680.44] three and a half
[3680.44 → 3681.16] four years now
[3681.16 → 3682.48] and my channel's
[3682.48 → 3683.80] not a recommended channel
[3683.80 → 3684.32] under tech
[3684.32 → 3685.14] which is sort of
[3685.14 → 3686.38] clearly the category
[3686.38 → 3686.88] that I'm in
[3686.88 → 3688.92] so yeah
[3688.92 → 3689.94] that sort of
[3689.94 → 3691.48] that was a shot
[3691.48 → 3691.86] through the heart
[3691.86 → 3692.86] because I'm very sure
[3692.86 → 3693.94] that people use this
[3693.94 → 3695.00] to find channels
[3695.00 → 3695.42] oh yeah
[3695.42 → 3696.88] so they've totally
[3696.88 → 3697.70] screwed up
[3697.70 → 3698.60] the regionality
[3698.60 → 3699.84] they've totally
[3699.84 → 3700.42] screwed up
[3700.42 → 3701.46] as far as I can tell
[3701.46 → 3702.42] the channels
[3702.42 → 3702.98] that are actually
[3702.98 → 3703.64] showing up here
[3703.64 → 3704.08] because
[3704.08 → 3705.22] like some of these
[3705.22 → 3706.70] see Samsung Mobile's here now
[3706.70 → 3708.04] now that we're here
[3708.04 → 3709.40] Apple's here
[3709.40 → 3710.10] Google's here
[3710.10 → 3711.10] I mean that's the thing
[3711.10 → 3711.92] about Samsung too
[3711.92 → 3712.32] is it's like
[3712.32 → 3712.64] I guess
[3712.64 → 3713.76] I guess I shouldn't
[3713.76 → 3714.70] necessarily be that
[3714.70 → 3715.44] butt hurt about it
[3715.44 → 3715.76] because
[3715.76 → 3717.68] if they left out Samsung
[3717.68 → 3718.84] who's one of Google's
[3718.84 → 3719.70] key partners
[3719.70 → 3721.32] like key strategic partners
[3721.32 → 3722.34] for the future
[3722.34 → 3723.52] of Android
[3723.52 → 3724.90] then it's
[3724.90 → 3725.80] it's probably not
[3725.80 → 3726.26] something where
[3726.26 → 3726.64] they were like
[3726.64 → 3727.24] oh yeah
[3727.24 → 3728.00] well that minus
[3728.00 → 3728.64] Tech Tubes guy
[3728.64 → 3729.12] I think we'll just
[3729.12 → 3729.52] pull him out
[3729.52 → 3730.26] but I think it's just
[3730.26 → 3731.00] that's how broken
[3731.00 → 3731.90] the algorithm is
[3731.90 → 3734.88] I mean
[3734.88 → 3735.64] Ray William Johnson
[3735.64 → 3736.50] is in three different
[3736.50 → 3737.02] categories
[3737.02 → 3738.24] and I'm not in
[3738.24 → 3739.04] the tech category
[3739.04 → 3740.14] it's like
[3740.14 → 3740.76] well what are you guys
[3740.76 → 3741.32] doing over there
[3741.32 → 3741.70] and like well
[3741.70 → 3742.66] Ray should definitely
[3742.66 → 3744.64] be in at least one
[3744.64 → 3745.22] but still
[3745.22 → 3746.32] but only one
[3746.32 → 3747.28] you don't get to be
[3747.28 → 3748.08] in like six different
[3748.08 → 3748.58] categories
[3748.58 → 3749.00] it's like
[3749.00 → 3750.52] so if I make one video
[3750.52 → 3751.08] about makeup
[3751.08 → 3752.38] and I have 200,000
[3752.38 → 3752.80] subscribers
[3752.80 → 3753.50] should I demand
[3753.50 → 3754.24] to be under makeup
[3754.24 → 3755.08] because I have a bunch
[3755.08 → 3755.50] of subscribers
[3755.50 → 3757.24] like I know
[3757.24 → 3757.74] it's ambiguous
[3757.74 → 3758.44] sometimes
[3758.44 → 3759.50] but jeez
[3759.50 → 3760.58] I mean there's stuff
[3760.58 → 3761.22] in here that isn't
[3761.22 → 3761.54] tech
[3761.54 → 3762.40] the slo-mo guys
[3762.40 → 3763.34] is not a tech channel
[3763.34 → 3764.72] and here it is
[3764.72 → 3765.64] it's listed under tech
[3765.64 → 3766.38] I don't understand
[3766.38 → 3767.12] how that makes
[3767.12 → 3768.46] any sense whatsoever
[3768.46 → 3769.74] so there
[3769.74 → 3771.46] I hope that wasn't
[3771.46 → 3772.52] too boring for you guys
[3772.52 → 3773.22] I hope you guys
[3773.22 → 3773.92] found it interesting
[3773.92 → 3775.30] that is my take
[3775.30 → 3776.34] on how
[3776.34 → 3777.16] friggin'
[3777.16 → 3777.66] broken
[3777.66 → 3779.28] YouTube
[3779.28 → 3780.34] it's new
[3780.34 → 3780.96] horrible
[3780.96 → 3781.68] horrible
[3781.68 → 3782.64] horrible layout
[3782.64 → 3782.96] is
[3782.96 → 3784.08] here let's go to
[3784.08 → 3784.42] actually
[3784.42 → 3784.98] oh this is
[3784.98 → 3786.08] no this is another one
[3786.08 → 3786.46] ugh
[3786.46 → 3788.08] okay so we'll go look
[3788.08 → 3788.94] at an actual video
[3788.94 → 3789.28] now
[3789.28 → 3789.56] pause it
[3789.56 → 3789.82] pause it
[3789.82 → 3790.64] pause what
[3790.64 → 3791.22] oh yeah right
[3791.22 → 3791.62] thank you
[3791.62 → 3792.66] good work
[3792.66 → 3794.42] so we'll go look
[3794.42 → 3795.36] at an actual video
[3795.36 → 3796.82] maximize
[3796.82 → 3797.84] there we go
[3797.84 → 3798.86] so we got all this
[3798.86 → 3799.52] blank space over here
[3799.52 → 3800.30] that's not that bad
[3800.30 → 3801.68] I read the comments
[3801.68 → 3802.28] on my videos
[3802.28 → 3803.04] I really do
[3803.04 → 3803.74] I think a lot of
[3803.74 → 3804.46] YouTubers don't
[3804.46 → 3804.96] and I think they're
[3804.96 → 3805.50] missing out
[3805.50 → 3806.54] I read them too
[3806.54 → 3806.98] yep
[3806.98 → 3808.14] it's a great way
[3808.14 → 3808.72] to find out
[3808.72 → 3809.46] what the audience
[3809.46 → 3810.24] actually thinks
[3810.24 → 3810.84] of your content
[3810.84 → 3811.68] when I click
[3811.68 → 3812.42] all comments
[3812.42 → 3814.18] do you like how much
[3814.18 → 3814.70] of my screen
[3814.70 → 3815.40] I'm using now
[3815.40 → 3816.94] we're down to like
[3816.94 → 3817.38] a third
[3817.38 → 3819.52] and on the monitor
[3819.52 → 3820.14] that I have
[3820.14 → 3820.80] that I usually
[3820.80 → 3821.72] read comments on
[3821.72 → 3822.82] it's 2560
[3822.82 → 3823.70] by 1440
[3823.70 → 3824.76] which means
[3824.76 → 3825.20] I'm using
[3825.20 → 3825.72] a quarter
[3825.72 → 3826.30] of the monitor
[3826.30 → 3827.38] because it just
[3827.38 → 3828.46] mashes everything
[3828.46 → 3829.82] over to that corner
[3829.82 → 3830.74] and it's
[3830.74 → 3831.70] absolutely ridiculous
[3831.70 → 3833.54] so yeah
[3833.54 → 3834.28] how much do I like
[3834.28 → 3835.14] the new YouTube layout
[3835.14 → 3836.42] not a whole
[3836.42 → 3836.90] buggy
[3836.90 → 3838.16] buggy lot
[3838.16 → 3838.68] here
[3838.68 → 3840.12] sorry let's go ahead
[3840.12 → 3841.04] and kill that
[3841.04 → 3842.18] sorry that ended up
[3842.18 → 3843.36] being like my tirade
[3843.36 → 3844.16] and not so much
[3844.16 → 3846.52] not so much
[3846.52 → 3847.58] sort of conversation
[3847.58 → 3848.24] between us
[3848.24 → 3849.90] but I'm sorry for that
[3849.90 → 3850.74] no, no that's fine
[3850.74 → 3851.38] but yeah
[3851.38 → 3852.32] I hadn't checked it out
[3852.32 → 3852.78] way too much
[3852.78 → 3853.54] so I was
[3853.54 → 3855.02] I'm super
[3855.02 → 3855.78] super lamed
[3855.78 → 3857.34] ah
[3857.34 → 3860.00] no
[3860.00 → 3860.94] okay
[3860.94 → 3861.84] is slick
[3861.84 → 3862.48] take
[3862.48 → 3863.06] I didn't know
[3863.06 → 3863.70] what that meant
[3863.70 → 3864.50] until
[3864.50 → 3865.10] I had to ask
[3865.10 → 3865.50] one of my friends
[3865.50 → 3865.88] at school
[3865.88 → 3867.72] um
[3867.72 → 3869.02] I'm not like
[3869.02 → 3870.16] I'm still not entirely
[3870.16 → 3872.06] in full understanding
[3872.06 → 3872.42] of it
[3872.42 → 3873.08] but it means like
[3873.08 → 3874.06] huge fan of anime
[3874.06 → 3874.92] oh okay
[3874.92 → 3875.70] I watched one
[3875.70 → 3877.00] I need to eat
[3877.00 → 3877.66] so go ahead
[3877.66 → 3877.94] you're
[3877.94 → 3878.06] you're
[3878.06 → 3878.36] you're
[3878.36 → 3879.38] we'll switch sides
[3879.38 → 3880.00] in the bed again
[3880.00 → 3881.94] I watched one
[3881.94 → 3882.76] I pre-warmed it for you
[3882.76 → 3883.06] which
[3883.06 → 3883.68] oh god
[3883.68 → 3884.54] uh
[3884.54 → 3885.98] which as some people
[3885.98 → 3886.44] figured out
[3886.44 → 3887.16] from some of the videos
[3887.16 → 3887.76] my background
[3887.76 → 3888.26] on my laptop
[3888.26 → 3889.20] um
[3889.20 → 3890.66] it's Sword Art Online
[3890.66 → 3891.34] one of my friends
[3891.34 → 3892.58] drew that picture
[3892.58 → 3893.52] that's why it's the background
[3893.52 → 3894.00] on my laptop
[3894.00 → 3895.18] but anyway
[3895.18 → 3897.00] um
[3897.00 → 3898.34] if it's any consolation
[3898.34 → 3899.76] you came up first page
[3899.76 → 3901.66] if it's any consolation
[3901.66 → 3903.26] you come up on first page
[3903.26 → 3904.36] when you search for tech
[3904.36 → 3906.76] search for tech
[3906.76 → 3907.72] okay so that I
[3907.72 → 3908.18] I don't know
[3908.18 → 3908.68] I didn't see
[3908.68 → 3910.58] all I saw was the
[3910.58 → 3910.74] uh
[3910.74 → 3911.60] the recommended channels
[3911.60 → 3912.44] anyway I'm eating now
[3912.44 → 3913.14] so go ahead
[3913.14 → 3913.38] you
[3913.38 → 3913.82] right
[3913.82 → 3916.46] you have to pay
[3916.46 → 3917.22] Google to be there
[3917.22 → 3918.06] I've heard about
[3918.06 → 3918.96] search ranking stuff
[3918.96 → 3919.88] where you have to pay them
[3919.88 → 3920.70] but I don't
[3920.70 → 3921.68] suspect that
[3921.68 → 3923.34] guy with 5000 subscribers
[3923.34 → 3925.86] got there because of that
[3925.86 → 3927.06] um
[3927.06 → 3928.60] Unbox Therapy was there
[3928.60 → 3930.50] on international
[3930.50 → 3931.48] I don't think it was there
[3931.48 → 3931.88] on Canada
[3931.88 → 3932.12] no
[3932.12 → 3932.72] no
[3932.72 → 3933.72] not on international
[3933.72 → 3935.84] yes international
[3935.84 → 3936.62] no Canada
[3936.62 → 3937.48] even though he's based
[3937.48 → 3937.94] out of Toronto
[3937.94 → 3938.50] right
[3938.50 → 3938.84] okay
[3938.84 → 3940.56] uh
[3940.56 → 3942.84] what is the final
[3942.84 → 3943.54] platform for the
[3943.54 → 3944.04] forum
[3944.04 → 3945.38] uh
[3945.38 → 3945.78] bulletin
[3945.78 → 3947.82] yeah
[3947.82 → 3950.76] we paid for it
[3950.76 → 3951.60] already when you guys
[3951.60 → 3952.14] were sending your
[3952.14 → 3952.66] recommendations
[3952.66 → 3953.28] so we're not
[3953.28 → 3954.14] changing it now
[3954.14 → 3955.16] and bulletin's good
[3955.16 → 3956.10] we're going with
[3956.10 → 3956.52] bulletin
[3956.52 → 3959.02] um
[3959.02 → 3959.54] please talk about
[3959.54 → 3960.04] Intel already
[3960.04 → 3961.06] only 30 minutes left
[3961.06 → 3963.52] okay get started
[3963.52 → 3964.22] so I just bring it up
[3964.22 → 3964.40] okay
[3964.40 → 3965.66] Intel released a
[3965.66 → 3966.36] statement saying that
[3966.36 → 3967.12] they will
[3967.12 → 3968.10] well I'm still eating
[3968.10 → 3968.68] but whatever
[3968.68 → 3969.66] Intel released a statement
[3969.66 → 3970.20] saying that they're
[3970.20 → 3971.54] committed to LGA
[3971.54 → 3972.72] um
[3972.72 → 3973.50] although it was
[3973.50 → 3974.94] fairly kind of
[3974.94 → 3976.90] airy
[3976.90 → 3978.34] it wasn't like
[3978.34 → 3979.08] down to the point
[3979.08 → 3979.74] like oh
[3979.74 → 3981.74] 1155 tier
[3981.74 → 3982.90] and 2011 tier
[3982.90 → 3983.86] will always be LGA
[3983.86 → 3984.46] blah blah blah blah
[3984.46 → 3985.78] as we were all
[3985.78 → 3986.34] kind of hoping
[3986.34 → 3987.16] it was more just
[3987.16 → 3987.90] there will always be
[3987.90 → 3988.32] a socket
[3988.32 → 3990.34] so that could easily
[3990.34 → 3991.28] mean that
[3991.28 → 3992.72] exactly what we were
[3992.72 → 3993.30] saying before
[3993.30 → 3994.10] where they're getting
[3994.10 → 3995.44] rid of the 1155 tier
[3995.44 → 3996.02] could happen
[3996.02 → 3997.46] although I
[3997.46 → 3998.80] yeah
[3998.80 → 3999.52] explain tiers
[3999.52 → 4001.52] so there's
[4001.52 → 4002.00] we used to have
[4002.00 → 4002.76] one socket guys
[4002.76 → 4003.40] remember we used to
[4003.40 → 4004.62] have LGA 775
[4004.62 → 4006.42] LGA 771
[4006.42 → 4007.20] which was server
[4007.20 → 4007.72] only
[4007.72 → 4010.10] now it's just like
[4010.10 → 4011.14] uh workstation
[4011.14 → 4011.92] and really
[4011.92 → 4012.86] high-end enthusiast
[4012.86 → 4014.06] which is 2011 tier
[4014.06 → 4015.08] and then like
[4015.08 → 4015.96] average consumer
[4015.96 → 4016.78] average gamer
[4016.78 → 4017.60] not even average
[4017.60 → 4017.82] gamer
[4017.82 → 4018.50] pretty much every
[4018.50 → 4018.82] gamer
[4018.82 → 4019.64] which is
[4019.64 → 4021.12] 1155 tier
[4021.12 → 4022.24] um
[4022.24 → 4023.02] and you know what
[4023.02 → 4024.24] they've done that
[4024.24 → 4024.90] very gracefully
[4024.90 → 4026.00] because when they
[4026.00 → 4026.70] first introduced
[4026.70 → 4027.38] the dual socket
[4027.38 → 4027.84] system
[4027.84 → 4030.88] they launched
[4030.88 → 4031.68] the new processors
[4031.68 → 4032.62] on 1366
[4032.62 → 4034.38] and for quite a while
[4034.38 → 4035.58] if you didn't want
[4035.58 → 4036.54] to buy 1366
[4036.54 → 4037.58] enthusiast class
[4037.58 → 4037.98] platform
[4037.98 → 4038.42] you were still
[4038.42 → 4039.22] stuck with 775
[4039.22 → 4041.08] than finally
[4041.08 → 4043.28] 1156 rolled out
[4043.28 → 4044.80] and kind of
[4044.80 → 4045.30] caught up
[4045.30 → 4045.92] to the point
[4045.92 → 4046.28] where they were
[4046.28 → 4046.86] very close
[4046.86 → 4047.92] and then over
[4047.92 → 4048.42] the last
[4048.42 → 4048.96] almost what
[4048.96 → 4049.42] four or five
[4049.42 → 4049.96] years now
[4049.96 → 4051.34] Intel has slowly
[4051.34 → 4053.50] de-emphasized
[4053.50 → 4054.54] having the gamers
[4054.54 → 4055.14] and enthusiasts
[4055.14 → 4056.02] on that higher
[4056.02 → 4056.46] end platform
[4056.46 → 4056.90] to the point
[4056.90 → 4057.30] where when's
[4057.30 → 4057.84] the last time
[4057.84 → 4058.68] you saw a
[4058.68 → 4059.28] gaming rig
[4059.28 → 4060.66] that's not like
[4060.66 → 4061.88] just sort of
[4061.88 → 4062.64] because I can
[4062.64 → 4063.52] rig with like
[4063.52 → 4064.04] a six core
[4064.04 → 4064.98] but like a
[4064.98 → 4065.86] properly optimized
[4065.86 → 4066.40] gaming rig
[4066.40 → 4067.04] that's got a
[4067.04 → 4067.66] 2011 motherboard
[4067.66 → 4068.34] in it
[4068.34 → 4068.86] uh
[4068.86 → 4069.98] no one really
[4069.98 → 4070.60] because everyone
[4070.60 → 4071.32] that I know
[4071.32 → 4071.88] if they're building
[4071.88 → 4072.78] a 2011 system
[4072.78 → 4073.36] and they're a
[4073.36 → 4073.58] gamer
[4073.58 → 4075.00] it's also because
[4075.00 → 4075.64] they're like
[4075.64 → 4076.44] a programmer
[4076.44 → 4077.56] or a system
[4077.56 → 4077.96] guy
[4077.96 → 4078.92] or something
[4078.92 → 4079.50] where they want
[4079.50 → 4080.70] to run VMs
[4080.70 → 4081.40] that's the main
[4081.40 → 4081.90] reason why I
[4081.90 → 4082.52] actually see people
[4082.52 → 4083.74] run 2011 boards
[4083.74 → 4084.48] is because they
[4084.48 → 4085.98] want to run VMs
[4085.98 → 4086.30] uh
[4086.30 → 4087.28] because all the RAM
[4087.28 → 4087.88] all the additional
[4087.88 → 4088.68] processing power
[4088.68 → 4089.66] uh threads
[4089.66 → 4090.44] everything is really
[4090.44 → 4090.82] really helpful
[4090.82 → 4092.12] for VMs
[4092.12 → 4093.04] um but yeah
[4093.04 → 4093.62] pretty much
[4093.62 → 4094.28] anyone I know
[4094.28 → 4094.66] that's like
[4094.66 → 4095.32] yeah I'm a gamer
[4095.32 → 4096.44] it's just a 155
[4096.44 → 4098.08] which means that
[4098.08 → 4099.08] that really common
[4099.08 → 4100.24] socket is still
[4100.24 → 4102.48] under threat
[4102.48 → 4103.04] realistically
[4103.04 → 4103.78] because Intel
[4103.78 → 4104.50] hasn't completely
[4104.50 → 4104.94] cleared it
[4104.94 → 4105.90] AMD was like
[4105.90 → 4107.04] sockets all the way
[4107.04 → 4107.90] and they released
[4107.90 → 4108.86] this huge press thing
[4108.86 → 4109.46] about how
[4109.46 → 4110.32] uh
[4110.32 → 4110.92] all the rumours
[4110.92 → 4111.68] surrounding Intel
[4111.68 → 4112.24] and all that kind
[4112.24 → 4112.48] of stuff
[4112.48 → 4113.28] they just didn't care
[4113.28 → 4113.82] and were always
[4113.82 → 4114.34] going to support
[4114.34 → 4115.00] the do-it-yourself
[4115.00 → 4115.36] enthusiasts
[4115.36 → 4116.06] which is awesome
[4116.06 → 4116.92] that's really cool
[4116.92 → 4118.54] um but Intel
[4118.54 → 4119.14] is still
[4119.14 → 4119.92] even though they
[4119.92 → 4120.48] released a statement
[4120.48 → 4121.12] saying that they're
[4121.12 → 4122.00] dedicated to sockets
[4122.00 → 4123.30] I think
[4123.30 → 4124.44] they were dedicated
[4124.44 → 4125.22] to sockets anyway
[4125.22 → 4126.16] because if you move
[4126.16 → 4126.88] away from sockets
[4126.88 → 4127.98] the big server guys
[4127.98 → 4129.16] are not really
[4129.16 → 4129.70] going to be okay
[4129.70 → 4130.06] with that
[4130.06 → 4130.36] lol
[4130.36 → 4131.68] like at all
[4131.68 → 4133.52] so they're still
[4133.52 → 4134.86] definitely going to
[4134.86 → 4135.36] support sockets
[4135.36 → 4135.46] I mean you look
[4135.46 → 4135.92] at supercomputer
[4135.92 → 4136.94] projects like
[4136.94 → 4137.30] um
[4137.30 → 4138.44] crap what's that one
[4138.44 → 4139.08] that just rolled out
[4139.08 → 4139.84] all those Teslas
[4139.84 → 4140.66] and Aztec did an
[4140.66 → 4141.36] article about it
[4141.36 → 4142.48] I don't know
[4142.48 → 4143.02] the name of it
[4143.02 → 4143.42] I don't remember
[4143.42 → 4144.28] but they constantly
[4144.28 → 4144.78] swap them
[4144.78 → 4145.42] they upgraded all
[4145.42 → 4146.16] their CPUs at the
[4146.16 → 4146.66] same time
[4146.66 → 4147.80] yeah they have like
[4147.80 → 4149.42] guys whose job it
[4149.42 → 4150.26] is to just like
[4150.26 → 4151.88] mass socket swap
[4151.88 → 4152.90] CPUs so like
[4152.90 → 4154.80] they weren't going to
[4154.80 → 4155.64] just ditch it
[4155.64 → 4156.68] and they're basically
[4156.68 → 4157.38] just saying yeah
[4157.38 → 4157.90] we're not going to
[4157.90 → 4158.72] just completely ditch
[4158.72 → 4160.54] it but no total
[4160.54 → 4161.20] promises on the
[4161.20 → 4162.44] whole idea
[4162.44 → 4163.70] so they could still
[4163.70 → 4165.12] roll out the
[4165.12 → 4165.96] 1155 tier
[4165.96 → 4166.88] and go with
[4166.88 → 4167.60] BGA
[4167.60 → 4168.08] but
[4168.08 → 4169.44] I would argue
[4169.44 → 4170.12] AMD didn't have
[4170.12 → 4170.76] any choice but
[4170.76 → 4171.28] to say that
[4171.28 → 4172.68] I mean you look
[4172.68 → 4173.60] at how they behaved
[4173.60 → 4174.14] like yes
[4174.14 → 4175.24] they could kind of
[4175.24 → 4175.66] go like
[4175.66 → 4176.48] rah rah rah
[4176.48 → 4177.48] we support
[4177.48 → 4178.18] overclockers
[4178.18 → 4178.78] we have unlocked
[4178.78 → 4179.44] CPUs
[4179.44 → 4179.84] we have this
[4179.84 → 4180.42] we have that
[4180.42 → 4181.24] but
[4181.24 → 4182.46] okay
[4182.46 → 4183.76] look at back
[4183.76 → 4184.12] when they were
[4184.12 → 4184.64] riding high
[4184.64 → 4185.76] they had one
[4185.76 → 4186.52] unlocked CPU
[4186.52 → 4187.52] it cost a
[4187.52 → 4188.20] thousand dollars
[4188.20 → 4189.76] okay
[4189.76 → 4191.96] you look at
[4191.96 → 4192.56] how long it
[4192.56 → 4193.12] took them to
[4193.12 → 4193.98] roll out that
[4193.98 → 4195.16] unlocking all the
[4195.16 → 4195.62] way down
[4195.62 → 4196.74] I think what was
[4196.74 → 4197.32] the original
[4197.32 → 4199.14] I think it was a
[4199.14 → 4199.92] Phantom X4
[4199.92 → 4200.72] we finally got a
[4200.72 → 4201.20] black edition
[4201.20 → 4201.78] yeah
[4201.78 → 4202.60] or was it an
[4202.60 → 4203.24] original Phantom
[4203.24 → 4203.60] what were the
[4203.60 → 4204.28] original Phenoms
[4204.28 → 4205.44] was there a 940
[4205.44 → 4205.80] black
[4205.80 → 4207.28] I'm not sure
[4207.28 → 4209.46] I think there
[4209.46 → 4210.02] might have been a
[4210.02 → 4210.64] 940 I can't
[4210.64 → 4211.50] remember I'm
[4211.50 → 4212.00] sorry I can't
[4212.00 → 4212.56] remember but
[4212.56 → 4214.58] they took quite a
[4214.58 → 4215.50] while until we
[4215.50 → 4216.00] got to the point
[4216.00 → 4216.42] where anything
[4216.42 → 4216.98] other than the
[4216.98 → 4217.88] flagship whatever
[4217.88 → 4218.56] price that was
[4218.56 → 4219.26] coming in at
[4219.26 → 4220.54] was unlocked
[4220.54 → 4221.66] to where now
[4221.66 → 4222.72] every FX is
[4222.72 → 4223.64] unlocked all the
[4223.64 → 4224.04] way down to
[4224.04 → 4224.48] like a hundred
[4224.48 → 4224.94] and whatever
[4224.94 → 4225.34] dollars
[4225.34 → 4225.78] yeah, but that's
[4225.78 → 4226.30] also a bit of
[4226.30 → 4226.62] theme
[4226.62 → 4228.50] yeah, but it's a
[4228.50 → 4228.88] theme that they
[4228.88 → 4229.66] had to implement
[4229.66 → 4230.44] yeah
[4230.44 → 4230.98] they didn't have
[4230.98 → 4231.42] a choice
[4231.42 → 4232.42] so I mean it's
[4232.42 → 4233.00] all fine and good
[4233.00 → 4233.68] for them to say
[4233.68 → 4234.26] you know rah, rah
[4234.26 → 4234.90] rah we're supporting
[4234.90 → 4235.36] the socket
[4235.36 → 4235.98] rah rah rah
[4235.98 → 4236.54] we're supporting
[4236.54 → 4237.32] overclocking and
[4237.32 → 4237.84] modding and all
[4237.84 → 4239.32] that but what else
[4239.32 → 4239.84] can they say at
[4239.84 → 4240.24] this point
[4240.24 → 4242.80] oh discussion
[4242.80 → 4243.50] topic though
[4243.50 → 4244.82] and this was
[4244.82 → 4245.36] something that I
[4245.36 → 4245.86] tweeted about
[4245.86 → 4246.30] already
[4246.30 → 4247.64] do you know
[4247.64 → 4248.14] what an Avalon
[4248.14 → 4248.80] MP is
[4248.80 → 4249.80] no
[4249.80 → 4251.32] oh okay
[4251.32 → 4252.48] can I take my
[4252.48 → 4253.10] last bite first
[4253.10 → 4253.62] yeah
[4253.62 → 4254.42] okay should I
[4254.42 → 4254.82] ask them
[4254.82 → 4255.52] probably
[4255.52 → 4256.60] guys can I
[4256.60 → 4257.28] just do this
[4257.28 → 4258.42] they said no
[4258.42 → 4276.42] no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no that's disgusting I'm going to eat move my goodness I need toilet paper
[4276.42 → 4282.76] that's actually how did you even manage that for my hands not for that no, but how did you manage to get all of that all over your hand
[4282.76 → 4290.22] because I put the wrap down in the plate that already had the drippings from the last wrap I ate so the outside of it was covered in grease
[4290.22 → 4294.22] you know like you know like you just after you flip it over, and you know like you just after you flip it over, and it doesn't drip out
[4294.22 → 4298.02] I have no idea what you're talking about
[4298.02 → 4299.28] don't worry about it
[4299.28 → 4307.24] okay so yeah we all know AMD's sort of you know hard times right now and all that
[4307.24 → 4313.02] and like okay jumping back a little bit you can say yeah they had to say that but they still said it and you can't just completely
[4313.02 → 4317.02] devalue something because you see that it was necessary
[4317.02 → 4317.60] yes I can
[4317.60 → 4323.70] if I have like that axe to your throat and I say tell me you think I'm like hot and sexy and awesome and funny
[4323.70 → 4326.08] and you say that do I believe you
[4326.08 → 4327.68] um
[4327.68 → 4329.08] no
[4329.08 → 4331.58] I would argue AMD has an axe to their throat right now
[4331.58 → 4333.32] have you seen their stock price
[4333.32 → 4334.08] no
[4334.08 → 4335.50] I'm sure it's horrible
[4335.50 → 4336.94] they're going to be a penny stock in no time
[4336.94 → 4337.86] so
[4337.86 → 4338.60] yeah
[4338.60 → 4340.42] they're
[4340.42 → 4341.14] come on
[4341.14 → 4343.22] still they've been taking that angle before
[4343.22 → 4345.08] it isn't exactly new
[4345.08 → 4346.98] and like you're saying the unlock processor thing but
[4346.98 → 4349.88] that was a whole market slow movement
[4349.88 → 4352.50] Intel was pretty slow about that too
[4352.50 → 4357.06] yeah they were slow about it, but they were selling plenty of CPUs at the time like they
[4357.06 → 4360.44] when Intel rolled out K-series they didn't have to
[4360.44 → 4361.46] right
[4361.46 → 4363.78] whereas when AMD was doing it had to
[4363.78 → 4365.96] so who do I trust more inherently here
[4365.96 → 4368.32] right, but it's also been a really, really long time
[4368.32 → 4369.56] yeah it took a long time
[4369.56 → 4370.40] okay right
[4370.40 → 4375.82] so the artificial locking of multipliers goes right way back to the Barton days
[4375.82 → 4377.22] that was when AMD started doing it
[4377.22 → 4379.84] in fact early 2500 pluses were unlocked
[4379.84 → 4381.80] and later 2500 pluses weren't
[4381.80 → 4386.60] when I resold my original my first DIY computer I built for myself had a 2500 plus
[4386.60 → 4390.20] and when I sold it I actually got more than I paid for it
[4390.20 → 4397.74] because it was an older unlocked one and AMD had started locking multipliers so guys in case you don't know this locking the multiplier is an artificial thing that's done
[4397.74 → 4407.60] it is a product differentiation strategy that allows them to sell something for more when the product actually isn't any different
[4407.60 → 4408.60] so they both do it
[4408.60 → 4410.50] and there's a lot of stuff that's like that
[4410.50 → 4411.34] things like cash
[4411.34 → 4419.88] your 3930k has just as much cash on it as a 3970x, but they've turned off some of it, or it was defective or whatever else
[4419.88 → 4423.26] okay so multiplier unlocking
[4423.26 → 4426.74] here's another artificial limitation
[4426.74 → 4429.72] so any CPU these days whether it's from Intel or AMD
[4429.72 → 4435.66] has all the key communication bus built right into the CPU
[4435.66 → 4440.18] whether it's a front side bus or a hyper transport or a CPI or whatever else
[4440.18 → 4445.26] so what they've been doing since before my day
[4445.26 → 4448.12] so a little bit before Athlon XP
[4448.12 → 4454.42] is they've been artificially limiting the ability for two sockets and a motherboard to communicate with each other
[4454.42 → 4457.42] so great examples of this are things like Skull Trail
[4457.42 → 4461.58] things like VGA SR2 and SRX
[4461.58 → 4467.56] where the only CPUs that work in these configurations are Eons
[4467.56 → 4471.70] or the only CPUs that work in a dual CPU configuration are Operons
[4471.70 → 4476.10] and you know what I think it's time for us all to just call BS on that
[4476.10 → 4481.40] because there are so many applications that scale well with cores now, and I'm not talking games no gaming here
[4481.40 → 4485.40] but 3d rendering, video editing, after effects
[4485.40 → 4488.40] all this kind of stuff scales incredibly well of course
[4488.40 → 4493.40] we can build awesome multicore CPUs these days that have great single threaded performance
[4493.40 → 4501.70] and we've got both AMD and Intel basically giving us the old, you know, it's the wrong finger, but you get the point
[4501.70 → 4507.00] if we actually want to just take two CPUs on the cheap, throw them in a machine
[4507.00 → 4510.00] and go okay, I don't care about single thread performance that much
[4510.00 → 4514.00] I want two lower clock CPUs and I want them to just be like
[4514.00 → 4518.00] wicked fast for some kind of maybe I want to run a bunch of virtual machines
[4518.00 → 4519.30] again for a ton
[4519.30 → 4523.30] yeah, I was just saying, dedicating an entire CPU to like two virtual machines would be amazing
[4523.30 → 4527.30] we have desktop platforms now that are capable of 64 gigs of RAM
[4527.30 → 4528.80] I was running that in the one behind you
[4528.80 → 4531.80] if I could throw two CPUs in there for a total of 12 cores
[4531.80 → 4535.30] or even two cheap quad cores for a total of 8 cores
[4535.30 → 4538.30] like, frigging awesome, right?
[4538.30 → 4539.30] that's like, what's that?
[4539.30 → 4543.00] like 8 gigs of RAM per core that you could run virtual machines on
[4543.00 → 4551.60] that would bring back a like, weird performance scramble that we haven't really seen in like, custom computers in a really long time
[4551.60 → 4558.80] right, okay, so the Athlon MP was a cheapo Athlon CPU, not a server grade CPU
[4558.80 → 4563.30] that actually had like a cheapo dual socket platform, remember this is socket A
[4563.30 → 4566.40] that was capable of running two CPUs
[4566.40 → 4568.80] I remember seeing one in London Drugs
[4568.80 → 4574.10] before I was into DIY, when I thought shopping at London Drugs was a good idea for computer stuff
[4574.10 → 4578.40] and it was just, it occurred to me the other day, it's like
[4578.40 → 4580.90] okay, well TDPs are going down
[4580.90 → 4584.60] so in terms of board design limitations
[4584.60 → 4586.60] it shouldn't really be anything that complicated
[4586.60 → 4590.40] because we don't have to deal with these hot, hot CPUs anymore
[4590.40 → 4594.40] core counts and single threaded performance continue to go up
[4594.40 → 4597.00] why not enable this?
[4597.00 → 4598.70] if AMD, like, okay
[4598.70 → 4603.50] AMD needs to sell CPUs to enthusiasts, which they can't do right now
[4603.50 → 4606.70] they need to sell more CPUs, which they can't do right now
[4606.70 → 4611.20] they need to gain back some mind share with something other than an empty press release
[4611.20 → 4614.50] about, you know, something that they had to say anyway
[4614.50 → 4616.80] because realistically, what were they going to do?
[4616.80 → 4620.00] it's like, oh, we're committed to the socket, because that's on their roadmap
[4620.00 → 4622.00] probably because they didn't think of it first
[4622.00 → 4625.60] and wait, AMD actually only said until 2014
[4625.60 → 4626.60] what?
[4626.60 → 4628.60] so there you go
[4628.60 → 4632.60] and 2014 is, I think, when, that's when Pile driver is supposed to last till
[4632.60 → 4636.60] so they haven't even committed an AM4 socket or anything like that
[4636.60 → 4638.60] until they did the same thing
[4638.60 → 4642.80] yeah, so if they wanted to basically go, look, we care about this again
[4642.80 → 4647.60] give us a multiprocessor-capable desktop platform
[4647.60 → 4648.60] why not?
[4648.60 → 4651.10] I don't know
[4651.10 → 4654.70] because a Phenom 2, or an FX rather, an FX8 series
[4654.70 → 4656.70] is good enough for gaming
[4656.70 → 4658.70] from a single core perspective
[4658.70 → 4664.70] whereas, like, any affordable Leon is clocked at like 2, 2.3 gig, like it's slow
[4664.70 → 4666.70] whereas you could overclock these things
[4666.70 → 4667.70] because they're FX's
[4667.70 → 4669.70] I mean, they tried to do this with 4x4
[4669.70 → 4671.70] or whatever that ended up getting called
[4671.70 → 4675.30] yeah, I don't remember
[4675.30 → 4678.90] 4x4 at first, that dual FX, dual-core thing
[4678.90 → 4682.50] but in that case, they made the platform so expensive
[4682.50 → 4685.10] and like, the CPUs were so power hungry
[4685.10 → 4686.10] and blah blah blah
[4686.10 → 4688.10] like, make it a cheap chipset
[4688.10 → 4689.10] cheap chipset
[4689.10 → 4693.10] let guys like Asus Gigabyte MSI come to market with cheapo motherboards
[4693.10 → 4696.10] that can take two sockets, it's fast enough for gaming
[4696.10 → 4699.10] and you would just have, like, horsepower
[4699.10 → 4701.20] to just throw at whatever you could
[4701.20 → 4702.70] you could never slow down that system
[4702.70 → 4705.70] you throw a couple SSDs in their in RAID
[4705.70 → 4707.70] you throw a couple, like, wicked graphics cards in there
[4707.70 → 4709.50] there is nothing that system couldn't do
[4709.50 → 4711.10] it would be a folding monster
[4711.10 → 4714.10] I think the reason why they don't is
[4714.10 → 4717.70] maybe you get a rush in sales right away
[4717.70 → 4719.10] well, it might hurt Operon in the long run
[4719.10 → 4719.90] but that's what I mean
[4719.90 → 4722.10] but then you've got that system that can do everything
[4722.10 → 4724.30] and you've got the problem which we have right now
[4724.30 → 4725.70] but we're already there
[4725.70 → 4726.70] oh, I know, but...
[4726.70 → 4727.70] like, we're already there, so...
[4727.70 → 4728.70] you would just make it worse, though
[4728.70 → 4731.10] but at least they could sell two CPUs to every person
[4731.10 → 4732.70] who upgrades their computer instead of one
[4732.70 → 4733.50] right, right
[4733.50 → 4734.10] I mean...
[4734.10 → 4737.70] but, like, we've got the problem where everyone is running a 260
[4737.70 → 4739.70] or everyone is running an 8800
[4739.70 → 4741.70] and they just don't care because it still runs everything
[4741.70 → 4744.70] like, some guy asked me, I don't remember exactly what games he listed
[4744.70 → 4748.70] but he's like, what graphics card will run this, this, this, this, all fine
[4748.70 → 4749.70] I'm like...
[4749.70 → 4750.70] take your pick?
[4750.70 → 4752.70] yeah, like, whatever you want, man
[4752.70 → 4754.70] I was like, uh, 260
[4754.70 → 4755.70] because I know from personal experience
[4755.70 → 4756.70] because I used to run a 260
[4756.70 → 4760.70] uh, some guy that comments on a lot of my stuff was named his graphics card
[4760.70 → 4762.70] and he's like, I've been running this forever, and it runs everything
[4762.70 → 4763.70] and I'm like...
[4763.70 → 4764.70] yup
[4764.70 → 4765.70] like...
[4765.70 → 4766.70] what...
[4766.70 → 4767.70] yeah, good job
[4767.70 → 4769.70] but, like, at the same time
[4769.70 → 4771.70] like, okay, Cry Engine 3
[4771.70 → 4773.70] ah, I'm so excited for Cry Engine 3
[4773.70 → 4774.70] but the specs have been released
[4774.70 → 4775.70] I know, they look good
[4775.70 → 4778.70] they do, but everyone's like, oh, look at the minimum requirement
[4778.70 → 4779.70] it's not that high
[4779.70 → 4781.70] but realistically, it's going to be trash
[4781.70 → 4782.70] okay, yes
[4782.70 → 4783.70] it's going to be absolutely trash
[4783.70 → 4785.70] I mean, have you run Crisis 1 at minimum details?
[4785.70 → 4786.70] it's horrible
[4786.70 → 4787.70] it looks like Halo 1
[4787.70 → 4788.70] it's terrible
[4788.70 → 4790.70] and you still lag like crazy
[4790.70 → 4791.70] it doesn't even matter
[4791.70 → 4793.70] like, minimum spec
[4793.70 → 4797.70] does not equate what you should actually be running it at
[4797.70 → 4799.70] and that's one thing I think people don't really care about
[4799.70 → 4801.70] and what I love about that too
[4801.70 → 4803.70] this is the best part
[4803.70 → 4806.70] is that the like, the baller recommended spec
[4806.70 → 4807.70] 680
[4807.70 → 4808.70] is maximum stuff
[4808.70 → 4809.70] which basically means
[4809.70 → 4810.70] it doesn't exist
[4810.70 → 4812.70] because if there was something better
[4812.70 → 4813.70] they'd probably go with that
[4813.70 → 4816.70] I think when Crisis was released
[4816.70 → 4817.70] it was, uh...
[4817.70 → 4819.70] and Cry Engine 3 is supposed to scale too, right?
[4819.70 → 4820.70] yes
[4820.70 → 4822.70] so if you throw in, like, their high-end performance ones
[4822.70 → 4824.70] they're like, oh, 680 or equivalent
[4824.70 → 4827.70] if you throw 2 in, it's going to scale up
[4827.70 → 4829.70] so here, guys
[4829.70 → 4831.70] this is what, um...
[4831.70 → 4833.70] this is what Crisis called for
[4833.70 → 4834.70] back when it was released
[4834.70 → 4836.70] so it asked for
[4836.70 → 4838.70] uh...
[4838.70 → 4839.70] do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[4839.70 → 4841.70] minimum system requirements
[4841.70 → 4843.70] like a 6800 GT or greater
[4843.70 → 4845.70] 9800 Pro it was asking for
[4845.70 → 4849.70] which is, like, was not that great of a card back then
[4849.70 → 4851.70] and then recommended
[4851.70 → 4853.70] it was asking for an 8800 GTS
[4853.70 → 4855.70] 640
[4855.70 → 4856.70] which...
[4856.70 → 4857.70] that would cry
[4857.70 → 4858.70] running that game
[4858.70 → 4859.70] yes
[4859.70 → 4860.70] that would get crushed
[4860.70 → 4861.70] running that game
[4861.70 → 4862.70] I had an 8800 GTS running it
[4862.70 → 4864.70] I had a gigabyte 8800 GTS
[4864.70 → 4865.70] and I tried to run Crisis
[4865.70 → 4866.70] and just...
[4866.70 → 4868.70] medium settings maybe
[4868.70 → 4869.70] not even 1080p
[4869.70 → 4870.70] even on medium
[4870.70 → 4871.70] and I was running 1080p
[4871.70 → 4872.70] so on medium settings
[4872.70 → 4874.70] it, like, just balled its eyes out
[4874.70 → 4875.70] it would get crushed
[4875.70 → 4876.70] so I am super hopeful
[4876.70 → 4877.70] about Crisis 3
[4877.70 → 4879.70] I mean, people were tweeting me
[4879.70 → 4881.70] they're like, oh, we saw the Crisis 3 specs
[4881.70 → 4883.70] and oh, it doesn't look like it's going to be
[4883.70 → 4884.70] oh, yeah, it's going to be demanding
[4884.70 → 4886.70] I'm super excited
[4886.70 → 4888.70] I can't wait until
[4888.70 → 4890.70] I need to upgrade that 480
[4890.70 → 4892.70] and I love how they have 4 different tiers
[4892.70 → 4893.70] it's like minimum
[4893.70 → 4894.70] something
[4894.70 → 4895.70] like maximum
[4895.70 → 4896.70] and you're like
[4896.70 → 4898.70] even once you start getting into recommended
[4898.70 → 4900.70] it starts asking for pretty good hardware
[4900.70 → 4901.70] so...
[4901.70 → 4902.70] and not to mention
[4902.70 → 4903.70] like, there's going to be guys
[4903.70 → 4905.70] there's going to be mods for it in all likelihood
[4905.70 → 4907.70] if they're sticking to what they said
[4907.70 → 4908.70] where it's going to be a proper PC title
[4908.70 → 4911.70] so, yeah, people are going to find ways to amp up the textures
[4911.70 → 4912.70] and everything else
[4912.70 → 4913.70] well, Star Citizen
[4913.70 → 4914.70] Star Citizen
[4914.70 → 4915.70] so, other games
[4915.70 → 4916.70] modded servers
[4916.70 → 4917.70] modded whole servers
[4917.70 → 4918.70] other games running the engine
[4918.70 → 4919.70] could even bring more
[4919.70 → 4921.70] I mean, remember, this is just an FPS
[4921.70 → 4922.70] with some jungle or something
[4922.70 → 4924.70] you want like a friggin' universe running the engine
[4924.70 → 4926.70] you're probably going to need some more horsepower
[4926.70 → 4928.70] well, EVE isn't that hard to run on the universe
[4928.70 → 4930.70] well, yeah, but it's also not running Cry Engine 3
[4930.70 → 4931.70] I agree
[4931.70 → 4932.70] so, bam
[4932.70 → 4935.70] and I think the action bits
[4935.70 → 4939.70] I think the action bits of Star Citizen are going to be a little bit more intense
[4939.70 → 4940.70] than...
[4940.70 → 4941.70] do you know he played EVE for years?
[4941.70 → 4942.70] yeah
[4942.70 → 4943.70] I love EVE
[4943.70 → 4944.70] we should all just yell at him
[4944.70 → 4945.70] EVE's good
[4945.70 → 4946.70] EVE is good
[4946.70 → 4947.70] EVE is good
[4947.70 → 4948.70] EVE is good
[4948.70 → 4949.70] just because you can't handle it
[4949.70 → 4950.70] doesn't mean it's a bad game
[4951.70 → 4952.70] BOO
[4953.70 → 4954.70] do all you want, EVE is good
[4955.70 → 4956.70] whatever man
[4956.70 → 4957.70] I've been thinking about getting back into it
[4957.70 → 4958.70] oh, no, don't do it
[4958.70 → 4959.70] don't do it
[4959.70 → 4960.70] don't do it
[4960.70 → 4961.70] no, don't do it
[4961.70 → 4962.70] don't do it
[4962.70 → 4963.70] it's not worth it, man
[4963.70 → 4965.70] you know it's not worth it
[4965.70 → 4966.70] I know
[4966.70 → 4967.70] but I just...
[4967.70 → 4969.70] you're going to have a full-time job
[4969.70 → 4970.70] soon, so...
[4970.70 → 4971.70] yeah
[4972.70 → 4973.70] okay, we talked about Intel
[4973.70 → 4975.70] we talked about the YouTube layout
[4976.70 → 4977.70] there was...
[4977.70 → 4978.70] uh... AC
[4979.70 → 4980.70] ah, wireless AC!
[4981.70 → 4986.70] so, we were playing around with our first wireless AC router and client
[4987.70 → 4988.70] in the Tech Tips lab today
[4988.70 → 4989.70] and...
[4989.70 → 4990.70] um...
[4991.70 → 4992.70] well...
[4992.70 → 4993.70] how'd it go?
[4993.70 → 4995.70] it's kinda terribly
[4996.70 → 4997.70] yeah
[4998.70 → 4999.70] yeah
[4999.70 → 5002.70] we tested a 1 gigabyte file transfer, and it took...
[5003.70 → 5004.70] uh...
[5004.70 → 5005.70] about 30% longer? 20% longer?
[5005.70 → 5007.70] took N plus a minute and a half
[5008.70 → 5009.70] N450
[5009.70 → 5010.70] N450
[5010.70 → 5011.70] yeah
[5011.70 → 5012.70] N450 it took a minute and a half
[5012.70 → 5014.70] on the same router, on the AC router
[5014.70 → 5015.70] yep
[5015.70 → 5017.70] and then on AC it took...
[5017.70 → 5018.70] two...
[5019.70 → 5020.70] two minutes?
[5020.70 → 5021.70] two minutes?
[5021.70 → 5024.70] it was like 158 or 159 or something like that
[5024.70 → 5025.70] yeah
[5025.70 → 5028.70] so this was an AC router that was 1200 AC 450N
[5029.70 → 5030.70] yeah
[5030.70 → 5033.70] so in theory it should've been three times faster
[5033.70 → 5034.70] but we were using...
[5034.70 → 5037.70] what was our actual dongle? 1200 or something, right?
[5037.70 → 5038.70] 1200
[5038.70 → 5039.70] 1200
[5039.70 → 5042.70] so in theory 1200, so it should've been three times faster almost
[5043.70 → 5044.70] oh, yeah, almost
[5044.70 → 5045.70] almost
[5045.70 → 5046.70] not quite
[5046.70 → 5047.70] two and a half times faster
[5047.70 → 5048.70] yeah
[5048.70 → 5049.70] so that was not our experience with it
[5050.70 → 5054.70] so I guess the real question is, is now the time to upgrade to an AC router?
[5054.70 → 5059.70] because, bearing in mind, that AC router with maybe better clients are coming that will support...
[5059.70 → 5061.70] like more clients are coming...
[5061.70 → 5063.70] because right now you almost can't buy anything with AC
[5063.70 → 5065.70] there's like some media bridges
[5065.70 → 5067.70] there's this one USB adapter
[5067.70 → 5069.70] and that's another funny thing is like
[5069.70 → 5070.70] pop quiz
[5070.70 → 5073.70] what is the maximum throughput of USB 2?
[5077.70 → 5078.70] you don't remember, do you?
[5078.70 → 5079.70] is it 480?
[5079.70 → 5081.70] yeah, 480 megabits per second
[5081.70 → 5084.70] so if I'm going to be like, yeah, wireless AC!
[5084.70 → 5086.70] I didn't realize you were asking me
[5086.70 → 5088.70] yeah, them, you, doesn't matter
[5088.70 → 5092.70] yeah, AC! 1200 megabits per second on a USB adapter
[5092.70 → 5093.70] yeah
[5093.70 → 5094.70] yay
[5094.70 → 5096.70] because it came with USB 2
[5096.70 → 5098.70] which was just flabbergasting
[5098.70 → 5101.70] so, so, okay, so like real clients
[5101.70 → 5103.70] I mean that might have been the problem
[5103.70 → 5104.70] I don't know
[5104.70 → 5105.70] I don't think it was
[5105.70 → 5106.70] I seriously doubt it
[5106.70 → 5107.70] because it was slower
[5107.70 → 5108.70] it doesn't really make any sense
[5108.70 → 5109.70] but there's a lot of overhead
[5109.70 → 5110.70] still
[5110.70 → 5111.70] yeah
[5111.70 → 5113.70] it was slower by 30 seconds on a scale of 2 minutes
[5113.70 → 5114.70] okay
[5114.70 → 5115.70] that's pretty bad
[5115.70 → 5116.70] okay
[5116.70 → 5117.70] um
[5117.70 → 5119.70] so, so, right
[5119.70 → 5121.70] better clients are probably coming
[5121.70 → 5122.70] more clients are probably coming
[5122.70 → 5124.70] the routers obviously not crap
[5124.70 → 5125.70] because those were pretty good end speeds
[5125.70 → 5126.70] yep
[5126.70 → 5127.70] if I recall correctly
[5127.70 → 5128.70] um
[5130.70 → 5131.70] but
[5131.70 → 5132.70] is, right
[5132.70 → 5133.70] is now the time to upgrade
[5133.70 → 5134.70] because
[5134.70 → 5135.70] you can still get an AC router
[5135.70 → 5137.70] that is a good end access point
[5137.70 → 5139.70] so if you're buying a new router today
[5139.70 → 5141.70] do you buy AC?
[5141.70 → 5142.70] personally, no
[5142.70 → 5143.70] personally, no
[5143.70 → 5144.70] okay, why?
[5144.70 → 5145.70] EA 4500
[5145.70 → 5146.70] oh, I know
[5146.70 → 5147.70] I know, I know
[5147.70 → 5148.70] I know
[5148.70 → 5149.70] you love the EA
[5149.70 → 5150.70] I love the EA 4500 too
[5150.70 → 5151.70] everyone should love the EA 4500
[5151.70 → 5152.70] it's like $200 though
[5152.70 → 5153.70] my, my, my, my, so, these
[5153.70 → 5154.70] but it's amazing
[5154.70 → 5155.70] Black Friday sale it was like $140
[5155.70 → 5156.70] was it really?
[5156.70 → 5157.70] I was really tempted
[5157.70 → 5158.70] that's a perfect deal
[5158.70 → 5159.70] I know
[5159.70 → 5160.70] you already have a 3500
[5160.70 → 5161.70] I know
[5161.70 → 5165.70] don't just buy extra routers
[5165.70 → 5166.70] I didn't
[5166.70 → 5167.70] how many times have we been through this?
[5167.70 → 5171.70] he wanted to buy a new keyboard
[5171.70 → 5173.70] just to have one that's loud and one that's quiet
[5173.70 → 5174.70] I'm probably still going to
[5174.70 → 5175.70] oh
[5175.70 → 5177.70] you're killing me here
[5177.70 → 5178.70] um
[5178.70 → 5179.70] okay
[5179.70 → 5181.70] well what if your phone supported AC?
[5181.70 → 5182.70] which it doesn't
[5182.70 → 5183.70] I mean hopefully phones are coming soon
[5183.70 → 5184.70] but then what?
[5184.70 → 5185.70] um
[5185.70 → 5188.70] I'd want to see the actual effect of throughput
[5188.70 → 5190.70] because if it's kind of like what we saw in the office then no
[5190.70 → 5199.70] I had an interesting conversation with Links where they basically said that there was one out of a big box chain
[5199.70 → 5203.70] I'm not going to say who it was, but it was like Future Shop Best Buy Staples like it was one of those guys
[5203.70 → 5210.70] out of one out of a big box chain there was one store that had their, their return rate for tablets was like one third of all the other stores
[5210.70 → 5219.70] and when asked how the heck are you getting people to keep their tablets because it's big box people just buy this stuff, and they're like oh Android I can't figure it out
[5219.70 → 5220.70] they take it back right
[5220.70 → 5221.70] um
[5221.70 → 5226.70] they were like oh well when people come back they just ask them when's the last time you updated your router
[5226.70 → 5232.70] and when they upgrade to an M router they have a way better experience with it, they don't find it so slow, and they end up keeping them
[5232.70 → 5234.70] and um
[5234.70 → 5236.70] my response to that was
[5236.70 → 5239.70] my iPhone 4 has wireless end
[5239.70 → 5244.70] and when I actually just do like oh my battery ran out because people tweeted me too much
[5244.70 → 5250.70] when I actually do just like a raw file transfer it peaks around 1 megabyte 1.2 megabytes per second
[5250.70 → 5252.70] have you tested your galaxy s3?
[5252.70 → 5255.70] uh if I'm transferring to my computer I do it through a cable
[5255.70 → 5256.70] through a cable
[5256.70 → 5259.70] because it's better for your battery to charge your phone through your computer not a wall plug
[5259.70 → 5261.70] so I always charge it through my computer anyway
[5261.70 → 5262.70] okay
[5262.70 → 5264.70] okay then
[5264.70 → 5265.70], so would you mean
[5265.70 → 5266.70] so no I am
[5266.70 → 5267.70] okay well fine
[5267.70 → 5273.70] so right 1 megabyte per second what's that translate to in sort of megabit
[5273.70 → 5274.70] 8 megabit?
[5274.70 → 5275.70] yeah so that's about 8 megabit
[5275.70 → 5280.70] which means even after all the overhead there's really no reason why wireless G shouldn't be fast enough for that
[5280.70 → 5282.70] and I mean we're
[5282.70 → 5286.70] the tablet spec the tablet stat I'm talking about is from like a year and a half ago 2 years ago
[5286.70 → 5289.70] or like whenever Terra 2 launched
[5289.70 → 5290.70] yeah
[5290.70 → 5291.70] so whenever that was
[5291.70 → 5292.70] a year ago?
[5292.70 → 5293.70] whatever
[5293.70 → 5294.70] so something
[5294.70 → 5295.70] something ago
[5295.70 → 5296.70] and um
[5296.70 → 5298.70] I would make the argument a couple of things
[5298.70 → 5301.70] so number one is that wireless G should have been plenty fast
[5301.70 → 5305.70] number two is that there shouldn't have really been any processor and any tablet at that time
[5305.70 → 5307.70] that was that much faster than what's in here
[5307.70 → 5308.70] well okay
[5308.70 → 5310.70] um to add to this argument maybe that's why
[5310.70 → 5311.70] uh
[5311.70 → 5316.70] maybe that's a huge part of the reason why WRT-54G lasted so long with better firmware
[5316.70 → 5317.70] right
[5317.70 → 5318.70] with tomato
[5318.70 → 5320.70] because people could make it good enough
[5320.70 → 5321.70] right
[5321.70 → 5323.70] and G has really, really good range too
[5323.70 → 5324.70] I know
[5324.70 → 5325.70] G has amazing range
[5325.70 → 5326.70] that's another thing about AC
[5326.70 → 5331.70] AC relies on 5 gigahertz which means less interference but actually less range as well
[5331.70 → 5332.70] yeah yeah
[5332.70 → 5335.70] and I already drop wireless in my house using wireless N all the time
[5335.70 → 5336.70] if uh
[5336.70 → 5338.70] if you can get in range though
[5338.70 → 5339.70] then
[5339.70 → 5340.70] 5 gigahertz is like
[5340.70 → 5341.70] primo
[5341.70 → 5342.70] absolutely primo
[5342.70 → 5343.70] I love 5 gigahertz
[5343.70 → 5344.70] but you can get 5 gigahertz N
[5344.70 → 5345.70] yeah
[5345.70 → 5346.70] which is what I'm running at home right now
[5346.70 → 5347.70] right
[5347.70 → 5348.70] so
[5348.70 → 5350.70] so that's not a strong argument for AC either
[5350.70 → 5351.70] um
[5351.70 → 5352.70] so anyway
[5352.70 → 5357.70] I would make the argument that if I can only do 1 megabyte per second sustained throughput on this guy
[5357.70 → 5358.70] over wireless
[5358.70 → 5360.70] and this is like at a reasonable distance from my access point
[5360.70 → 5364.70] like I'm not right next to it, but I'm also not 8 rooms over either
[5364.70 → 5370.70] I don't think there's anything yet in a mobile handheld that's more what 3 times faster than this
[5370.70 → 5375.70] so that would give us maximum like 3 megabytes per second throughput
[5375.70 → 5377.70] and if you're getting 3 legs per second on your phone
[5377.70 → 5382.70] and we're not talking artificial speed test I'm talking I'm actually downloading a file from my server
[5382.70 → 5384.70] to my phone on Wi-Fi
[5384.70 → 5386.70] I wish I had more
[5386.70 → 5391.70] because I can't even really say anything because I haven't done like actual legit file transfers
[5391.70 → 5392.70] right
[5392.70 → 5395.70] and I haven't timed any downloads over LTE
[5395.70 → 5397.70] but I've had stuff come down pretty freaking fast
[5397.70 → 5401.70] let's have people on Twitter see if they just totally disagree with me
[5401.70 → 5403.70] no one's talking about it
[5403.70 → 5404.70] oh we can
[5404.70 → 5407.70] this is a good Q&A question though we'll cover that one after
[5407.70 → 5411.70] so okay I would make the argument that wireless AC will do absolutely nothing for phones
[5411.70 → 5413.70] because wireless N
[5413.70 → 5418.70] like wireless N 1 antenna is already 150 megabits
[5418.70 → 5422.70] so even if your phone is 3 times faster than this one
[5422.70 → 5427.70] that means still you're talking 25 megabit or so real world is all you really need
[5427.70 → 5429.70] were you doing a file transfer from your own PC?
[5429.70 → 5430.70] yeah
[5430.70 → 5431.70] from my home server
[5431.70 → 5433.70] not the bottleneck
[5433.70 → 5434.70] I want to actually try this
[5434.70 → 5436.70] maybe we should do a video on it sometime or something
[5436.70 → 5439.70] because I haven't tried it at all with my phone, so I don't really want to comment
[5439.70 → 5440.70] so I don't know
[5440.70 → 5442.70] I don't know what's going to drive AC adoption
[5442.70 → 5446.70] because what seems to me that people complain about for wireless is mostly range
[5446.70 → 5448.70] reliability
[5448.70 → 5453.70] so AC will address some reliability, but you can just as easily do that with a 5 GHz wireless N
[5453.70 → 5454.70] oh yeah
[5454.70 → 5457.70] and range is not going to be helped by AC
[5459.70 → 5461.70] speed would be another one
[5461.70 → 5466.70] but based on our experience it's not there yet in terms of like the hardware actually
[5466.70 → 5468.70] we're also in like draft, pre-draft range
[5468.70 → 5469.70] yes
[5469.70 → 5470.70] so
[5470.70 → 5472.70] and I mean the chipsets run so hot and consume so much power
[5472.70 → 5475.70] it's going to be a while before we see it properly implemented on like Ultrabook
[5475.70 → 5480.70] and phones which are the most Wi-Fi reliant platforms
[5480.70 → 5481.70] yeah
[5481.70 → 5484.70] I would argue that the processor in your phone
[5484.70 → 5485.70] sometime in the next
[5485.70 → 5487.70] it'll take what maybe another 3, 4, 5 years
[5487.70 → 5490.70] before it even remotely requires AC speeds
[5490.70 → 5494.70] I mean it's not usually my thing
[5494.70 → 5497.70] minus tech tips to be like yeah you really don't need this
[5497.70 → 5498.70] yeah
[5498.70 → 5500.70] but when it comes to
[5500.70 → 5501.70] but at the same time
[5501.70 → 5502.70] okay yeah
[5502.70 → 5503.70] we have to be realistic about it
[5503.70 → 5504.70] yeah
[5504.70 → 5505.70] um AC maybe not
[5505.70 → 5509.70] but at the same time I think it is realistic for people to look into options like EA 4500
[5509.70 → 5513.70] instead of their like random green stripe
[5513.70 → 5517.70] kind of trashy rotor that they just buy because they think it's going to do the job
[5517.70 → 5521.70] like there is legitimately way better experiences than you're having right now
[5521.70 → 5522.70] right
[5522.70 → 5526.70] because I'm sure most of the people watching do not have something like an EA 4500
[5526.70 → 5529.70] and slits coming from a very heavy usage household
[5529.70 → 5536.70] I mean if it's like two people then you know what use the stupid wireless router that came with your modem because who cares
[5536.70 → 5537.70] yeah
[5537.70 → 5539.70] but I mean how many people are in your house right now
[5539.70 → 5541.70] we've got four people all of which are gamers
[5541.70 → 5544.70] there are a lot of file transfers that happen
[5544.70 → 5545.70] a lot of watching streams
[5545.70 → 5547.70] a lot of gaming
[5547.70 → 5548.70] a lot of
[5548.70 → 5550.70] and on a residential just normal internet connection
[5550.70 → 5553.70] your router actually makes a huge difference
[5553.70 → 5554.70] yeah
[5554.70 → 5557.70] so any multi multi-person household I could see it making a big difference
[5557.70 → 5558.70] yeah
[5558.70 → 5559.70] you know what let's wrap up with a little Q&A
[5559.70 → 5561.70] I actually didn't realize it's almost 11 o'clock
[5561.70 → 5562.70] so
[5562.70 → 5563.70] oh wow
[5563.70 → 5564.70] like wow
[5564.70 → 5566.70] so great question from Fade
[5566.70 → 5567.70] why is it better to charge your battery over USB
[5567.70 → 5568.70] well
[5568.70 → 5569.70] okay they're all over USB
[5569.70 → 5573.70] but why is it better to charge your battery from your computer versus from the AC wall outlet
[5573.70 → 5574.70] take it away
[5574.70 → 5577.70] when you plug your phone into the wall compared to
[5577.70 → 5579.70] when you plug it into a computer you might notice it charges slower
[5579.70 → 5581.70] that's actually a good thing
[5581.70 → 5585.70] because when you trickle charge something it keeps its total capacity for a longer period of time
[5585.70 → 5589.70] so over a year your total capacity of your battery is going to go down
[5589.70 → 5592.70] but if you trickle charge it says through a computer which isn't exactly trickle charging
[5592.70 → 5594.70] but its more trickle charging than plugging it into a wall
[5594.70 → 5595.70] slower
[5595.70 → 5596.70] yeah
[5596.70 → 5600.70] it'll hold that total capacity at least better than when you plug it into a wall
[5600.70 → 5604.70] if you're plugging into a wall all the time it's just throwing so much power at it at all points in time
[5604.70 → 5606.70] that your total capacity actually
[5606.70 → 5608.70] there's grass word online you can look this up
[5608.70 → 5612.70] will kind of be okay for a little while but then will tank really, really hard
[5612.70 → 5614.70] now modern batteries handle it better
[5614.70 → 5615.70] yep
[5615.70 → 5617.70] than older batteries, but it's still a factor
[5617.70 → 5621.70] and something else that this is just my sort of common sense alarm going off
[5621.70 → 5623.70] I don't know if there's any validity to this but
[5623.70 → 5624.70] um
[5624.70 → 5628.70] okay think about the power that's being delivered over this medium
[5628.70 → 5631.70] so for USB you've got it going through
[5631.70 → 5635.70] so you've got your AC power which is going into hopefully a UPS
[5635.70 → 5636.70] but probably not
[5636.70 → 5643.70] but into a computer power supply which has very strict regulations in terms of the voltage fluctuations and all of that
[5643.70 → 5646.70] which is then going through your motherboard which is regulating again
[5646.70 → 5649.70] you're getting 5 volts come hell or high water
[5649.70 → 5652.70] to that device which charges off 5 volts
[5652.70 → 5657.70] now whether you bought an iPhone or a cheapo phone or a Samsung phone the reality of it is
[5657.70 → 5660.70] that little power brick you have they optimized it for two things
[5660.70 → 5662.70] space savings and cost
[5662.70 → 5666.70] someone in Xinjiang China or somewhere is making that adapter
[5666.70 → 5673.70] at a spec of space and cost and not necessarily at a spec of exactly the right output voltage
[5673.70 → 5675.70] or no fluctuation whatsoever
[5675.70 → 5679.70] a power supply is an incredibly complex piece of electronics
[5679.70 → 5681.70] and think about it
[5681.70 → 5684.70] why is it that your power supply for your computer costs a hundred dollars
[5684.70 → 5688.70] and this thing costs like you know 30 cents to make
[5688.70 → 5692.70] which one is giving you cleaner power to your sensitive electronic device
[5692.70 → 5694.70] I would argue probably the computer
[5694.70 → 5695.70] yeah
[5695.70 → 5696.70] so I don't know if there's any truth to that
[5696.70 → 5697.70] but it's just sort of
[5697.70 → 5699.70] it's just probably
[5699.70 → 5701.70] yeah
[5701.70 → 5704.70] uh okay I have the Apple aluminum keyboard
[5704.70 → 5709.70] oh people buying multiple keyboards for their acoustics
[5709.70 → 5711.70] Ashley Craddock
[5711.70 → 5716.70] is there any good after market air coolers for the 7970 core edition
[5716.70 → 5717.70] um
[5717.70 → 5720.70] you know what I really just don't recommend after market
[5720.70 → 5722.70] graphics card coolers anymore
[5722.70 → 5724.70] I rarely I would just block it
[5724.70 → 5727.70] yeah get a water block or get a good graphics card in the first place
[5729.70 → 5730.70] um
[5730.70 → 5732.70] you should use your own router the extreme computing
[5732.70 → 5733.70] that's a decent router
[5733.70 → 5739.70] I hate that it's not possible to just a page and post something just by typing something, and it will automatically find the box
[5739.70 → 5746.70] what? What? I hate that it's not possible to just um
[5746.70 → 5748.70] okay moving along
[5748.70 → 5749.70] yeah
[5749.70 → 5752.70] Angel if you could only use one OS would you stay with Windows 7 or Windows 8?
[5752.70 → 5755.70] you know what we did an episode today that's going to be up hopefully soon
[5755.70 → 5757.70] where we added the start menu to Windows 8
[5757.70 → 5760.70] and I thought I didn't miss it, and then I was sure I missed it
[5760.70 → 5762.70] and then I thought maybe I could get used to not having it
[5762.70 → 5763.70] and then we put it in
[5763.70 → 5765.70] and I was like yeah this helps
[5765.70 → 5768.70] Windows 8 is snappier
[5768.70 → 5771.70] it has more up-to-date functionality like storage spaces
[5771.70 → 5772.70] it's quick
[5772.70 → 5773.70] it's just better
[5773.70 → 5775.70] and then you add start menu to it
[5775.70 → 5777.70] and the one on NineNight.com
[5777.70 → 5781.70] you can add the XP, the Vista or the classic start menu to it
[5781.70 → 5783.70] and you can change all the options
[5783.70 → 5784.70] it's very customizable
[5784.70 → 5787.70] you can go to like what is the little button called? View all options or something?
[5787.70 → 5788.70] yes
[5788.70 → 5791.70] and you get like two complete rows of toolbar tabs
[5791.70 → 5793.70] that are full of like customization
[5793.70 → 5794.70] it's kind of amazing it's perfect
[5794.70 → 5795.70] yeah it's awesome
[5797.70 → 5801.70] people who played Crisis 3 Alpha must not tell you anything about it
[5801.70 → 5804.70] but if they were allowed 7970 Ultra 27
[5804.70 → 5805.70] but if they are
[5805.70 → 5806.70] interesting
[5806.70 → 5808.70] interesting point Xavier
[5809.70 → 5812.70] he's saying he can't tell us anything about the FPS
[5812.70 → 5813.70] but if he could
[5814.70 → 5815.70] then that would be very surprising
[5815.70 → 5816.70] right
[5816.70 → 5818.70] Sonar DX for 20 bucks
[5819.70 → 5822.70] about a 1mm gap from the graphics card fan
[5822.70 → 5824.70] I would recommend finding another slot if you can
[5825.70 → 5827.70] I've been thinking about getting back into EVE as well
[5828.70 → 5829.70] guys don't do it
[5829.70 → 5830.70] yeah see DS Barlow
[5830.70 → 5831.70] don't do it
[5831.70 → 5832.70] don't do it
[5833.70 → 5835.70] Pellet wings are awesome
[5835.70 → 5837.70] I use those on my front radiator in my system
[5838.70 → 5840.70] and they undervolt really well
[5840.70 → 5841.70] yes Zach
[5841.70 → 5842.70] okay
[5842.70 → 5843.70] fine
[5843.70 → 5845.70] last conversation topic
[5845.70 → 5847.70] fan specs that matter
[5847.70 → 5849.70] okay so CFM and static pressure
[5849.70 → 5850.70] these are both important things
[5851.70 → 5852.70] noise
[5852.70 → 5853.70] these are important things
[5853.70 → 5854.70] but for me
[5855.70 → 5856.70] those take a secondary role
[5857.70 → 5858.70] to how gracefully they undervolt
[5858.70 → 5862.70] remember there's a lot more to a fan's noise signature
[5862.70 → 5863.70] it's noise characteristics
[5863.70 → 5867.70] than just how much noise it makes on a decibel meter
[5868.70 → 5869.70] okay
[5869.70 → 5870.70] think about that for a minute
[5870.70 → 5871.70] because if there's like a
[5872.70 → 5873.70] versus a
[5874.70 → 5875.70] which one's more annoying
[5875.70 → 5876.70] if there's like a
[5877.70 → 5879.70] very obnoxious
[5879.70 → 5881.70] whereas if it's just a low hum
[5881.70 → 5883.70] those can both read exactly the same
[5883.70 → 5884.70] on a sound meter
[5885.70 → 5886.70] but in actuality
[5886.70 → 5888.70] some of them are much more annoying than others
[5888.70 → 5890.70] that's why I'm kind of
[5890.70 → 5891.70] a huge fan of
[5892.70 → 5893.70] Chisel Typhoons
[5893.70 → 5894.70] Air penetrators are good too
[5894.70 → 5895.70] I'm not
[5895.70 → 5896.70] yeah
[5896.70 → 5897.70] did you ever try air penetrators?
[5897.70 → 5898.70] no I did
[5898.70 → 5899.70] I did
[5899.70 → 5900.70] I really like them
[5900.70 → 5901.70] F-Series Noctua?
[5901.70 → 5902.70] also very good
[5902.70 → 5903.70] Pellet wings?
[5903.70 → 5904.70] I cannot stand the
[5904.70 → 5905.70] beige and brown
[5905.70 → 5906.70] I love Noctua
[5906.70 → 5907.70] and like
[5908.70 → 5909.70] NH-D14s
[5909.70 → 5910.70] I put them in so many systems
[5910.70 → 5911.70] but then they're just
[5911.70 → 5912.70] ugh
[5912.70 → 5914.70] why are you beige and brown?
[5914.70 → 5915.70] like they look okay in C70s
[5915.70 → 5917.70] because they give it like a weird
[5917.70 → 5918.70] military camo kind of look
[5918.70 → 5919.70] and it's kind of cool
[5919.70 → 5920.70] but other than that
[5920.70 → 5921.70] it's just like
[5921.70 → 5922.70] ugh
[5922.70 → 5923.70] this is their old colour scheme
[5923.70 → 5925.70] it actually wasn't quite as bad
[5925.70 → 5926.70] that's not nearly as bad
[5926.70 → 5927.70] this is uh
[5927.70 → 5930.70] this is from back when their first heat sink launched
[5930.70 → 5931.70] before they even had a pressure fan
[5931.70 → 5932.70] so it's more of a white
[5932.70 → 5934.70] and it's a darker brown
[5934.70 → 5936.70] whereas now it's kind of a Reddy brown
[5936.70 → 5937.70] yeah
[5937.70 → 5938.70] and it's like
[5938.70 → 5939.70] it's like a kind of weirder beige too
[5939.70 → 5940.70] yeah
[5940.70 → 5942.70] yeah they've actually done quite a few revisions on the colours
[5942.70 → 5943.70] I've seen them over the years
[5943.70 → 5944.70] they've changed a fair bit
[5944.70 → 5945.70] but like air penetrators
[5945.70 → 5946.70] gentle typhoons
[5946.70 → 5947.70] all these
[5947.70 → 5949.70] like the sound that you get from them
[5949.70 → 5950.70] even if it's
[5950.70 → 5951.70] even if it's a little bit loud
[5951.70 → 5952.70] like if you're running some fast ones
[5952.70 → 5954.70] and you're not downvoting them or anything
[5954.70 → 5955.70] um
[5956.70 → 5957.70] it's just
[5957.70 → 5959.70] like a woo shy air sound
[5959.70 → 5960.70] yeah
[5960.70 → 5961.70] like you just kind of hear the air flow
[5961.70 → 5963.70] you don't necessarily hear a ticking or a buzz
[5963.70 → 5964.70] or anything like that
[5964.70 → 5965.70] which is great
[5965.70 → 5966.70] and a lot of people ask me about like
[5966.70 → 5968.70] oh what's a good fan to buy
[5968.70 → 5969.70] this one's got perfect pressure
[5969.70 → 5970.70] or whatever it is
[5970.70 → 5972.70] Linus I see you never recommend this fan
[5972.70 → 5973.70] but it's got perfect specs
[5973.70 → 5974.70] it performs perfect
[5974.70 → 5975.70] usually
[5975.70 → 5976.70] um
[5976.70 → 5977.70] you know I take sort of
[5977.70 → 5978.70] if I don't have anything nice to say
[5978.70 → 5979.70] I don't really say anything at all
[5979.70 → 5981.70] approach about products
[5981.70 → 5982.70] um
[5982.70 → 5983.70] so if you see me recommending
[5983.70 → 5984.70] Gelid Wings
[5984.70 → 5985.70] gentle typhoons
[5985.70 → 5986.70] air penetrators
[5986.70 → 5987.70] and
[5987.70 → 5988.70] what was the last one I like
[5988.70 → 5989.70] oh right
[5989.70 → 5990.70] an Optus F series
[5990.70 → 5991.70] aww
[5991.70 → 5992.70] if you see me recommending those
[5992.70 → 5993.70] just buy them
[5993.70 → 5995.70] don't
[5995.70 → 5997.70] don't ask me if this other one is good
[5997.70 → 5998.70] because I'm going to be like
[5998.70 → 5999.70] eh it's okay
[5999.70 → 6000.70] because it is
[6000.70 → 6001.70] it's probably fine
[6001.70 → 6002.70] it's a fan
[6002.70 → 6003.70] I mean it's a motor
[6003.70 → 6004.70] and like blades
[6004.70 → 6005.70] and it moves air
[6005.70 → 6006.70] I mean it's not like rocket science
[6006.70 → 6007.70] but
[6007.70 → 6008.70] there's usually a reason
[6008.70 → 6010.70] that I'm recommending a specific fan
[6010.70 → 6011.70] over something else
[6011.70 → 6012.70] and I'm not
[6012.70 → 6013.70] okay I need to like
[6013.70 → 6014.70] make sure
[6014.70 → 6016.70] I'm not trashing on Noctua at all
[6016.70 → 6017.70] I love their fans
[6017.70 → 6018.70] I'm just not a huge fan of the uh
[6018.70 → 6019.70] I'm not a huge fan of the uh
[6019.70 → 6020.70] ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[6020.70 → 6021.70] oh my god
[6021.70 → 6022.70] yeah you're fired
[6022.70 → 6023.70] I'm not
[6023.70 → 6024.70] I'm not a huge fan of the colour scheme
[6024.70 → 6025.70] that's all
[6025.70 → 6027.70] other than that they're absolutely amazing
[6027.70 → 6028.70] I mean some fans
[6028.70 → 6029.70] perfect specs
[6029.70 → 6030.70] perfect noise
[6030.70 → 6031.70] um
[6031.70 → 6032.70] you know perfect pressure
[6032.70 → 6034.70] don't undervolt gracefully
[6034.70 → 6035.70] so what that means is
[6035.70 → 6036.70] they'll have some ticking
[6036.70 → 6037.70] or some buzzing
[6037.70 → 6038.70] or
[6038.70 → 6040.70] some PWM noise
[6040.70 → 6041.70] ah that's one
[6041.70 → 6042.70] sometimes fans
[6042.70 → 6043.70] if you control them with PWM
[6043.70 → 6044.70] they just
[6044.70 → 6045.70] crap the bed
[6045.70 → 6046.70] and they hate it
[6046.70 → 6048.70] and they'll make whining noises
[6048.70 → 6049.70] like coil whine
[6049.70 → 6050.70] so guys
[6050.70 → 6052.70] the fans I recommend
[6052.70 → 6053.70] just buy them
[6053.70 → 6054.70] and be happy
[6054.70 → 6056.70] don't ask me about other ones
[6056.70 → 6058.70] I think that's pretty much it
[6058.70 → 6060.70] thank you for the live
[6060.70 → 6061.70] tuning in tonight
[6061.70 → 6062.70] look at that
[6062.70 → 6063.70] I think we had 2200 people
[6063.70 → 6064.70] at the peak tonight
[6064.70 → 6065.70] yeah
[6065.70 → 6066.70] that's very good
[6066.70 → 6067.70] I think that's
[6067.70 → 6068.70] is that a best?
[6068.70 → 6069.70] I think that's a tie
[6069.70 → 6070.70] for the first time I came on
[6070.70 → 6071.70] so what you're gonna just
[6071.70 → 6072.70] give all the credit to yourself now?
[6072.70 → 6073.70] no
[6073.70 → 6074.70] do I need to remind you
[6074.70 → 6075.70] this is called
[6075.70 → 6076.70] Minus Tech Channel
[6076.70 → 6078.70] I was using that as like a point in time
[6078.70 → 6079.70] how else am I supposed to specify?
[6079.70 → 6080.70] you're fired
[6080.70 → 6081.70] that's three times
[6081.70 → 6082.70] he's so fired
[6082.70 → 6083.70] no I think that's four
[6083.70 → 6084.70] I don't know
[6084.70 → 6085.70] there's one
[6085.70 → 6086.70] one on the stairway
[6086.70 → 6087.70] yeah
[6087.70 → 6088.70] and then there's one when we first started live stream
[6088.70 → 6089.70] and then that
[6089.70 → 6091.70] no I fired you twice in the last like 30 seconds
[6091.70 → 6092.70] oh
[6092.70 → 6093.70] yeah
[6093.70 → 6094.70] I don't remember that
[6094.70 → 6095.70] they were separate
[6095.70 → 6096.70] they were discrete firings
[6096.70 → 6097.70] oh okay
[6097.70 → 6098.70] so yeah
[6098.70 → 6099.70] four times
[6099.70 → 6100.70] alright actually there's one more twitter question that I liked here
[6100.70 → 6101.70] I do have a 480
[6101.70 → 6102.70] that was the one
[6102.70 → 6103.70] Christopher really?
[6103.70 → 6104.70] yeah slick has a 480
[6104.70 → 6105.70] yeah I have a 480
[6105.70 → 6106.70] okay
[6106.70 → 6107.70] C70 or half
[6107.70 → 6108.70] go half XP
[6108.70 → 6111.70] Max Payne 3 also has top products as recommended
[6111.70 → 6112.70] okay
[6112.70 → 6113.70] older generation can still run
[6113.70 → 6115.70] why would you even ask a question like that?
[6115.70 → 6119.70] which older generation graphics card can still run modern games like Battlefield 3?
[6119.70 → 6120.70] good ones?
[6122.70 → 6123.70] my uh
[6123.70 → 6126.70] my 260 before I got rid of it ran Battlefield 3 but
[6126.70 → 6129.70] would kinda get upset at certain points in time
[6129.70 → 6133.70] if I mailed you a 2600 Pro and a 6600 GT
[6133.70 → 6135.70] would you send me a random card in return?
[6135.70 → 6139.70] it wouldn't be random, but it'd be something crappier than those for sure
[6139.70 → 6140.70] let's do that trade
[6140.70 → 6144.70] I love that I don't even have to commit to what I'm going to send them
[6144.70 → 6146.70] could AMD go bankrupt?
[6146.70 → 6147.70] they'd get bought
[6147.70 → 6148.70] yeah
[6148.70 → 6154.70] well we went over quite a bit tonight what we want AMD to do
[6154.70 → 6157.70] we talked a lot about Intel last week so
[6157.70 → 6160.70] I want to upgrade from 1156, and I can't decide between 1155 or FM2
[6160.70 → 6161.70] get 1155
[6161.70 → 6165.70] if one person yawns you do it too
[6165.70 → 6166.70] well yeah I know
[6166.70 → 6167.70] I do that so much
[6167.70 → 6169.70] I built my first machine when I was 12
[6169.70 → 6171.70] around my age Ben
[6171.70 → 6172.70] okay
[6172.70 → 6173.70] oh no
[6173.70 → 6174.70] okay well here
[6174.70 → 6175.70] we're going to wrap up with this
[6175.70 → 6176.70] careful
[6176.70 → 6179.70] just get ready to close it
[6179.70 → 6185.70] okay that's not too bad
[6185.70 → 6187.70] that's not too inappropriate
[6187.70 → 6188.70] alright goodnight everybody
[6188.70 → 6189.70] bye guys
[6189.70 → 6190.70] bye guys
