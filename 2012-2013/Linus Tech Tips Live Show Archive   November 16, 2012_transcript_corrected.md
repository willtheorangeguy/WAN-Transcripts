[0.00 → 2.70] Blah blah blah thing, a live stream of your broadcast.
[3.42 → 5.32] Why is it giving me these messages now?
[5.38 → 6.60] It's never shown me these before.
[6.84 → 7.60] Just go for it.
[7.88 → 9.54] Oh, it's recording anyway, so.
[10.50 → 10.66] Yeah.
[10.72 → 11.24] Oh, we're live?
[11.40 → 13.62] Yeah, Twitch is giving me some, or rather,
[13.96 → 17.06] XSplit is giving me some error that you have the stage,
[17.22 → 18.58] here, I'll show you guys the error,
[18.68 → 21.20] because this is a stupid, stupid, stupid error.
[21.62 → 22.26] Check this out.
[22.58 → 26.76] You have a stage resolution set to over 1920 by,
[27.46 → 28.46] oh, that's weird.
[28.78 → 29.56] Look at that.
[29.56 → 31.82] I'm dragging the window around, but you guys can't see it.
[31.86 → 34.50] It looks like XSplit hides itself from itself,
[35.02 → 36.92] so that it won't interfere with itself.
[37.42 → 40.30] And, of course, I've screwed up the hotkeys for tonight,
[40.48 → 43.48] so I cannot use my keyboard to switch from one view to another.
[43.84 → 44.72] Hi, I'm Linus.
[45.02 → 45.76] Hi, I'm Slick.
[46.84 → 47.20] See?
[47.76 → 49.02] Linus Tech on Twitter.
[49.30 → 50.32] Slick PC on Twitter.
[50.56 → 52.14] If you guys are following on Twitter,
[52.24 → 56.20] you'll already know that we had some technical difficulties tonight,
[56.20 → 58.62] so I'm going to sort of share those with you really quick,
[58.62 → 62.60] because, oh, man, it involved some not cool stuff.
[63.04 → 66.40] So, number one is that that is my dinner,
[66.66 → 67.56] which I have been eating,
[68.04 → 74.60] and number two is that there SSD right there has Windows 8 on it,
[74.84 → 77.52] which wouldn't normally have been a problem for us,
[77.52 → 80.30] except that we didn't have any of our software set up properly,
[80.30 → 88.34] and we were not able to get that there Black magic Intensity Pro Capture card working with it.
[88.34 → 93.12] So then we had some issues with the Squadron card here outputting to DisplayPort,
[93.30 → 98.22] which we thought would work fine with a perfectly DisplayPort.
[98.32 → 99.38] See that DisplayPort in?
[99.62 → 102.48] Enabled monitor, but it ended up not working.
[102.48 → 104.42] So then what happened next?
[107.08 → 109.70] We couldn't find any drivers for the motherboard.
[110.04 → 112.88] We couldn't find any drivers for the motherboard's LAN for that one,
[112.94 → 114.06] so I had to bust out my laptop,
[114.62 → 118.14] but then we switched back to the shuttle anyway and just tried to fix it,
[118.20 → 119.54] and then we couldn't get that to work,
[119.70 → 122.76] and then I touched the keyboard, and it just worked.
[122.76 → 126.30] Yeah, I mean, this is kind of like last time I got the Black magic card working,
[126.40 → 127.76] where I was in the middle of...
[127.76 → 131.94] I spent, I think, over a course of two days,
[132.04 → 134.18] a grand total of about seven hours on it,
[134.28 → 138.00] and what finally happened, like, I tried changing every setting,
[138.26 → 140.64] and then what finally happened was I changed one setting,
[140.96 → 143.22] and then the system blue-screened,
[143.22 → 147.58] and then it rebooted, and everything worked perfectly,
[147.68 → 149.36] and I was like, this is bad,
[149.60 → 152.26] because it's the very worst kind of troubleshooting,
[152.26 → 155.12] when you actually don't know what you did to fix it.
[155.34 → 155.56] Yeah.
[155.74 → 157.32] Because then when you have the issue again,
[157.54 → 160.06] you end up 35 minutes late for a live stream.
[160.44 → 160.84] Sorry.
[161.54 → 162.82] It's all his fault, you know.
[163.14 → 163.50] No.
[164.22 → 165.06] Okay, hold on.
[165.72 → 168.54] Okay, who removed the A-Data drive?
[168.60 → 169.54] You told me to remove it.
[169.76 → 171.40] I didn't know that was only one that was set up for it.
[171.40 → 172.10] Who removed it?
[172.10 → 172.88] Who removed it?
[172.88 → 173.80] I removed it.
[173.94 → 175.74] You removed it from the P280.
[176.26 → 179.38] So whose fault is it that we didn't have our streaming computer?
[179.38 → 183.78] I didn't realize that we wouldn't have a backup of the only drive that we have set up for streaming.
[184.62 → 186.80] Because I'm not the one that's done every single stream.
[187.30 → 188.74] Well, you were there for what?
[188.86 → 189.38] You know what?
[189.44 → 190.54] I don't think there's any ramp.
[191.20 → 194.16] I don't think I'm going to be able to successfully blame this on you.
[194.16 → 196.52] I can try, though.
[198.52 → 199.00] All right.
[199.06 → 204.96] I'm just signing in to Twitch TV so we can have a look at the chat and see if we have any audio issues
[204.96 → 209.66] that we're, of course, not aware of at all because we haven't even looked at it yet.
[211.40 → 211.80] Here.
[211.94 → 212.34] Hold on.
[212.40 → 212.82] Hold on.
[212.96 → 213.28] Channel.
[213.44 → 213.72] Channel.
[213.84 → 214.64] Go to the channel.
[215.14 → 217.26] Of course, I have to click this to show you guys.
[217.38 → 218.28] Oh, oh, oh.
[218.36 → 219.20] That's going to be a problem.
[219.68 → 220.30] There we go.
[220.40 → 221.08] Got that fixed.
[221.14 → 221.94] No audio issues.
[221.94 → 225.60] Hey, guys, speaking of audio issues, is the audio level okay tonight?
[226.16 → 227.50] Oh, funny story.
[227.66 → 228.84] Actually, awesome story.
[228.92 → 229.86] Did I tell you about this?
[230.02 → 230.50] I don't think so.
[230.50 → 236.06] So, I was telling Diesel, people are complaining about the audio levels on this camera.
[236.54 → 237.82] It's driving them crazy.
[238.76 → 242.86] And he's like, oh, that's funny.
[243.30 → 249.34] It's an $8,000 camera and a $300 or $200 or whatever dollar microphone.
[249.34 → 252.04] There should be no audio level issues, right?
[252.24 → 252.40] No.
[252.96 → 253.94] And I'm like, no, no.
[254.02 → 255.22] They're complaining about it.
[255.40 → 256.10] And I tried it.
[256.18 → 260.04] I cranked the dials all the way up to 10, and it didn't do anything.
[260.24 → 261.22] It didn't help at all.
[261.58 → 264.58] And he's like, oh, yeah, that's really weird.
[264.94 → 268.84] And then he's like, oh, you know you have the audio input level set to auto, right?
[268.84 → 272.86] And I was like, what do you mean set to auto?
[272.92 → 273.88] He's like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[273.94 → 278.06] If you want to use the manual dials, you have to turn it off auto mode.
[278.12 → 281.44] I'm like, what do you mean I have to turn it off auto mode?
[283.22 → 283.58] Nice.
[283.58 → 293.94] Yeah, so it took him a matter of like 15 seconds to embarrass me and not be stumped at all by
[293.94 → 296.78] the thing that had been driving me and the audience crazy for ages.
[297.04 → 300.98] So what all did we film today?
[302.36 → 303.40] Storage spaces.
[303.90 → 305.50] Okay, so Windows 8 storage spaces.
[305.60 → 306.38] We filmed that today.
[306.52 → 307.76] Western Digital Green Drives.
[308.02 → 308.48] Oh, yeah.
[308.64 → 310.32] WD has a new green drive, you guys.
[310.40 → 312.22] Maybe we'll talk a little bit about that on the live stream.
[312.22 → 313.18] Pretty cool.
[313.34 → 313.90] Do you think it's cool?
[314.24 → 315.00] Yeah, it's a lot faster.
[315.22 → 316.20] Yeah, way faster.
[316.30 → 317.30] Way faster green drive.
[317.38 → 317.82] Good stuff.
[317.96 → 319.90] And 3D balancing is always good.
[320.14 → 320.30] Yeah.
[320.50 → 322.02] What else did we film?
[322.14 → 323.44] I think, what, five episodes today?
[323.68 → 325.38] You finished off the tablet.
[325.94 → 326.44] Oh, yeah.
[326.50 → 328.48] We did a closer look at the Asus Vivo.
[329.56 → 330.00] Wow.
[330.20 → 332.04] The table was almost just knocked over.
[333.00 → 333.44] Excellent.
[334.32 → 334.64] Yeah.
[334.76 → 335.08] Yes.
[337.10 → 338.20] The HP Elite book.
[338.56 → 340.22] Yeah, we checked out an HP Elite book.
[340.22 → 342.24] So I did an unboxing of that Elite book already.
[342.38 → 344.68] But we did kind of just like a closer look at it.
[344.78 → 347.12] You know, some glamour shots of it with the better camera.
[348.50 → 349.70] I think there was one more.
[351.54 → 352.24] Extreme edition.
[352.56 → 353.78] 3960 versus 3970.
[354.04 → 354.36] Yes.
[354.62 → 355.58] New extreme edition.
[355.58 → 360.14] So we did five NCI Tech Tips episodes today.
[360.32 → 373.56] And then we rushed home, driving safely, at exactly the speed limit, in my car, navigating carefully between all the other cars.
[374.14 → 375.98] Got here as quickly as we could.
[376.48 → 378.76] And then I was like, Slick, you idiot.
[379.04 → 380.78] You took the boot camp over here.
[380.78 → 383.96] I'm not going to let you blame me for that.
[384.04 → 384.92] It's not my fault.
[387.02 → 388.70] So anyway, we're live.
[389.06 → 389.74] We're good.
[390.32 → 391.10] Everything's cool.
[391.70 → 393.06] And here you go.
[393.14 → 395.44] If you're not following us on Twitter, make sure you're following us on Twitter.
[395.86 → 396.90] Oh my goodness.
[397.06 → 398.06] You know what I just realized?
[398.70 → 406.88] Remember how I said we had to put together the judging for the keyboard nerd rage contest?
[406.88 → 407.48] You know what?
[407.64 → 408.76] We can announce it immediately after.
[409.28 → 409.56] Yeah.
[409.80 → 410.60] You know what, guys?
[410.90 → 413.12] We are going, we did a boo-boo.
[413.24 → 418.54] Because we were supposed to sit together for a few hours today and do all the judging for the contest.
[418.98 → 420.94] And we got tied up filming content.
[421.16 → 422.64] And then we got tied up doing this.
[423.08 → 424.84] So, tell you what, guys.
[425.42 → 432.34] Right after this live stream, which ends, unfortunately, which ends in about, we go to what, 9 till 10.30.
[432.54 → 434.18] So we'll maybe go to like 10.45 today.
[434.18 → 435.22] So ends in about an hour.
[435.56 → 436.64] We will judge them.
[436.72 → 445.34] And we will upload a video immediately to the Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel announcing the five winners of Corsair K90 keyboards.
[445.80 → 448.06] So I'm very sorry for that, guys.
[448.40 → 450.08] But, yes, that will be coming.
[451.26 → 455.74] Let's do a little bit of Twitter interaction before we go much further here.
[457.18 → 457.58] Ah.
[458.04 → 459.24] Yeah, we need cat tips.
[459.28 → 460.30] Okay, I'll bring in the cat.
[460.88 → 461.18] Rocket.
[462.02 → 462.50] Come here.
[462.50 → 463.00] Come here.
[463.76 → 464.36] Where's Rumble?
[464.70 → 465.28] Yeah, where's Rumble?
[465.38 → 465.66] Rumble!
[468.24 → 468.98] Oh, here it comes.
[469.18 → 469.64] Good boy.
[469.74 → 470.10] Come here.
[470.72 → 471.26] Come on.
[471.86 → 472.38] Come on.
[473.44 → 473.96] Come here.
[474.62 → 474.94] Rumble.
[475.12 → 475.38] Come on.
[475.54 → 475.98] There you go.
[476.16 → 476.42] Okay.
[476.62 → 477.52] We're bringing the cats.
[478.06 → 478.30] Okay.
[478.76 → 480.60] The cats have officially joined the live stream.
[480.70 → 481.16] There we go.
[481.62 → 481.88] Okay.
[481.98 → 484.70] So no more complaints about not enough cats, of course.
[485.38 → 487.08] Have you heard of a program, Start 8?
[487.08 → 488.96] It brings the Start Menu back to Windows 8.
[489.50 → 492.48] Actually, there are a few things that bring the Start Menus back to 8.
[492.54 → 494.22] Samsung has a proprietary thing.
[494.76 → 496.34] Slick heard about something as well.
[496.44 → 496.90] What was it called?
[497.24 → 498.20] Someone posted on my Twitter.
[498.28 → 502.74] I don't remember the exact name of it, but I think it was made by either Rocket Doc or Stardom.
[503.40 → 504.72] And it's supposed to just be amazing.
[505.00 → 507.54] I haven't tried it yet, but I'm planning to.
[507.86 → 508.12] Okay.
[508.28 → 509.44] So we'll give that a try.
[509.52 → 510.48] We'll see if we can figure it out.
[510.48 → 517.70] Honestly, the issue we had with Windows 8 tonight was related more to, I think, the Black magic card not having...
[517.70 → 518.42] Instead of Windows 8.
[518.56 → 521.70] ...maybe quite the right thing going on.
[521.72 → 522.74] Comedy stuff.
[522.90 → 523.12] Yeah.
[523.40 → 526.14] I think it barely kind of works with Windows 7.
[526.26 → 527.96] It's not surprising it has problems with Windows 8.
[527.96 → 532.20] I mean, we did some playing around with an Aver Media card, the LiveGamerHD.
[532.56 → 533.60] Was that Wednesday?
[534.52 → 535.08] It was Wednesday.
[535.10 → 535.78] That was Wednesday.
[536.52 → 538.50] Honestly, holy crap.
[539.16 → 540.58] Like, we...
[540.58 → 547.96] NCI Tech Tips episode, but I swear, we shot most of it in real time because it was just like...
[547.96 → 548.70] It just worked.
[548.86 → 550.20] It just worked right away.
[550.48 → 550.76] Yeah.
[551.20 → 556.86] And, like, we went from streaming from a PC to streaming from an Xbox, and it was literally just unplug, plug, instantly working.
[556.86 → 558.86] Yeah, that was just incredible.
[559.68 → 568.62] And it has the benefit of doing on-the-fly H.264 encoding for the content so you don't end up with, like, huge, huge, huge, huge files, which is really, really cool.
[569.28 → 570.84] Slick, good question for you.
[570.96 → 573.52] Will you be getting a new oil-cooled PC?
[574.46 → 575.96] No time in the near future.
[576.44 → 581.00] If I do, I have, like, a grand plan for what I want to do with the oil-cooled PC.
[581.00 → 584.92] While I had it, I had a lot of people saying, oh, why don't you put fish in it?
[585.02 → 586.42] Yeah, because fish can survive in oil.
[586.82 → 590.90] But what I actually really want to do is mount a smaller fish tank.
[590.90 → 591.98] Don't make fun of the viewers.
[592.62 → 594.20] It wasn't the viewers saying that, though.
[594.26 → 596.08] It was, like, friends of mine, which is embarrassing.
[596.08 → 607.08] But you can mount a smaller fish tank within a much larger fish tank and mount it up on, like, say, a plexiglass block or something and have a water fish tank with the mineral oil fish tank within it.
[608.30 → 613.72] So for those of you who haven't seen Slick's old oil-cooled PC, I'm running it in the window next to him here.
[614.22 → 614.92] Very, very cool.
[614.96 → 618.76] You want to just do a quick run-through explaining sort of what these guys are looking at right here?
[619.10 → 619.62] Stock cooler.
[619.76 → 620.52] Stock Intel cooler.
[620.60 → 620.98] Are you serious?
[621.48 → 621.68] Yeah.
[621.82 → 622.36] No, it's fine.
[622.48 → 623.14] It's absolutely fine.
[623.14 → 624.72] I had a custom cooler in there.
[624.78 → 626.18] It made absolutely no difference, actually.
[627.88 → 629.06] Oh, look at that ugly guy.
[630.04 → 630.28] There we go.
[630.28 → 631.92] Let's go back to the cool computer.
[632.20 → 634.12] I can't actually point at it because my hand goes off the screen.
[634.66 → 635.74] I'll point with the mouse here.
[635.82 → 635.94] See?
[636.12 → 637.28] Okay, so the white label.
[637.80 → 638.28] Yeah, here?
[638.36 → 638.94] That's a pump.
[639.36 → 640.06] Yeah, okay.
[640.30 → 642.10] Just pushes the oil back in.
[642.18 → 642.92] Dominator memory.
[643.08 → 643.82] Dominator memory.
[643.94 → 644.60] Like a boss.
[644.72 → 645.38] What board is this?
[646.50 → 648.46] The 750i for the win.
[648.62 → 649.50] Ah, yes.
[650.78 → 651.10] 750i.
[651.20 → 652.16] So LGA 775.
[652.16 → 654.46] Don't worry, we've upgraded Slick's machine since then.
[654.70 → 654.84] Yes.
[654.92 → 656.16] What about some of the...
[656.16 → 658.86] I mean, okay, talk about the challenges of running an oil-cooled computer.
[659.84 → 662.60] Okay, I ran it for like four years.
[662.90 → 666.62] Some people message me, and they're like, oh, I built an oil-cooled PC, and then I took it
[666.62 → 668.78] down two months later, and I had no problems, and it's really easy.
[669.06 → 673.10] When you start moving it around all the time, like I moved to Victoria and back with this,
[673.16 → 675.50] like I carried it in my arms on the ferry.
[677.20 → 678.56] How much did this thing weigh?
[678.56 → 679.56] A lot.
[679.72 → 684.74] I never actually like weighed it, but it weighed a ton and like I had to carry it with the
[684.74 → 686.98] radiator attached and everything on the ferry.
[687.74 → 689.54] Oh, I should show them.
[689.64 → 691.38] I should try and find the radiator here.
[691.78 → 692.76] Yeah, see there, there.
[692.84 → 693.32] Look guys.
[693.58 → 694.78] So the radiator's here.
[694.88 → 696.76] That's a quad 120 mid radiator.
[696.76 → 700.92] And so it's just not like permanently attached.
[700.92 → 701.22] It's not fixed.
[701.34 → 701.50] Yeah.
[701.50 → 702.42] It's not fixed in any way.
[702.48 → 703.62] It's just hanging with the tubes there.
[703.70 → 709.16] So I had to one arm the entire computer and all the oil and then like hold the radiator
[709.16 → 711.12] there so it didn't torque the hell out of my tubing.
[711.82 → 718.20] And then like some random stuff like oil hardens like cables and plastics, and it will climb
[718.20 → 718.94] when it heats up.
[718.98 → 719.68] I'm looking down there.
[720.98 → 722.62] And it'll climb when it heats up.
[722.88 → 727.34] So I had the IO for my computer coming up the top of the tank as you can see in the video.
[727.40 → 728.18] Oh, they can't see anymore.
[728.18 → 728.74] Okay, fine.
[728.84 → 728.94] There.
[729.06 → 729.64] There's IO.
[729.64 → 731.40] There's the IO and my hard drive.
[731.40 → 737.46] So the oil would climb up out of the top of the computer and go along the cables and
[737.46 → 739.60] like a little bit of it would get on my table.
[739.78 → 740.86] All the cables would harden.
[741.28 → 748.08] Like my cables for my ducky, which is so unfortunate, the nice detachable cable for my ducky is completely
[748.08 → 750.84] solid and in this like slightly snake formation.
[751.08 → 751.44] Awesome.
[751.84 → 754.42] So what would happen if you actually tried to...
[754.42 → 754.94] It would break.
[755.18 → 755.98] It would straight up break.
[756.06 → 756.24] Right.
[756.32 → 756.50] Okay.
[756.78 → 758.52] The plastic cracking on the outside would break.
[758.52 → 761.90] The wires on the inside are fine, but like exposing them is a terrible idea.
[762.24 → 762.50] Right.
[762.56 → 762.82] Okay.
[763.22 → 763.52] Right.
[763.72 → 766.76] So what you're saying is you'd never do it again.
[767.16 → 767.98] I would, actually.
[768.42 → 770.54] But there's the big plan.
[770.56 → 771.54] It's so much work.
[771.64 → 771.90] Yes.
[771.98 → 774.78] But this would be once I have a house, so I'm not moving it.
[775.16 → 775.40] Okay.
[775.54 → 775.70] Yeah.
[775.76 → 776.00] See.
[776.20 → 777.64] And this would be a way bigger budget.
[777.64 → 780.46] So I can add different things in like shielding, so the oil can't climb.
[780.48 → 780.62] No.
[780.80 → 781.42] Stupid project.
[781.76 → 788.40] Because it is no better than doing something like three triple radiators in a rad box and
[788.40 → 789.98] then water cooling every possible component.
[790.24 → 792.02] But it's fun and different and interesting.
[792.54 → 793.16] And I can have fish on it.
[793.16 → 794.02] So is having a huge rad box.
[794.10 → 794.98] And I can have fish on it.
[794.98 → 795.08] Yeah.
[795.12 → 798.96] But if you used a rad box, then you could run it outside.
[800.58 → 802.90] Then you have like the best temperatures possible.
[803.18 → 807.10] Because it never gets cold enough here in Vancouver that it would actually freeze if you're
[807.10 → 808.24] actually running it all the time.
[808.40 → 808.54] That's true.
[808.54 → 808.60] That's true.
[808.76 → 809.62] So you could have like...
[809.62 → 810.48] I can do that too.
[811.14 → 813.14] I'm not saying that I'll actually do an oil computer.
[813.26 → 815.28] Oil will get way too viscous if it gets that cold.
[815.42 → 816.38] So I won't put it outside.
[816.38 → 818.16] I meant I could do that as well.
[818.22 → 819.52] But then your temperatures would suck.
[820.48 → 821.26] Compared to water.
[821.34 → 821.76] But it's...
[821.76 → 822.90] I can put it on...
[822.90 → 823.86] Like I can...
[823.86 → 824.64] They can't see that.
[825.10 → 825.56] I'm going to show up.
[826.60 → 828.60] No one even cares because your idea is bad.
[828.76 → 829.36] No, it's cool.
[830.12 → 831.52] So like something like this.
[832.14 → 833.20] I guess if it was shorter.
[833.34 → 837.00] You could put a fish tank in that little alcove and then put the computer within it.
[837.38 → 838.38] And then you could hook that up to...
[839.82 → 840.38] The TV.
[840.38 → 841.34] Oh, okay.
[841.34 → 845.10] So you're just going to run a big fat HDMI cable all the way across like what?
[845.18 → 845.56] Your ceiling?
[845.66 → 848.36] Then you'll have like big ugly fixtures on your ceiling like that.
[850.12 → 850.52] See?
[850.86 → 853.46] That's what happens when you run cables all over your living room.
[853.56 → 854.92] You don't have to run it all over your living room.
[854.92 → 859.78] If you're doing a crazy setup like that, I'm pretty sure you could afford one red mirror cable.
[860.02 → 861.62] And you could afford to go into the wall.
[861.62 → 864.12] I'm pretty sure that the...
[864.12 → 864.68] Okay, fine.
[864.88 → 866.48] Let's talk about your dead graphics card now.
[869.18 → 872.10] As I pulled everything out of my system, my 260 died.
[872.34 → 872.58] Yeah.
[872.74 → 873.42] Oh, it died.
[873.54 → 873.74] Really?
[873.82 → 876.92] Do you think that was related to running it under oil for two and a half years?
[877.80 → 879.18] It was longer than that.
[879.26 → 880.10] But yeah, probably.
[880.32 → 881.18] That's probably true.
[881.34 → 881.68] Oh, gee.
[881.74 → 883.30] 260 is still a decent card.
[883.80 → 884.82] That's a real shame.
[884.82 → 885.14] Yeah.
[885.38 → 888.54] If nothing else, it could be a dedicated Fizz X card.
[888.54 → 891.72] Borderlands 2?
[893.06 → 893.42] What?
[893.66 → 894.74] Borderlands 2 is ridiculous.
[894.94 → 897.06] You can run it on anything at ridiculous high setting.
[897.52 → 898.88] And still get crazy frames made.
[898.94 → 901.42] But you'd get dedicated Fizz X.
[901.58 → 902.30] Who cares?
[902.66 → 903.52] Batman Arkham City?
[903.74 → 904.44] Who cares?
[904.92 → 905.46] Okay, well...
[905.46 → 907.68] We have the same view on that as me, so I don't even...
[907.68 → 912.14] Well, I think that a live video card is better than a dead one.
[912.14 → 912.78] I agree.
[913.10 → 914.26] And I wish I had my 260.
[914.52 → 914.78] I do.
[915.02 → 915.14] Yeah.
[915.56 → 916.10] It's fun.
[916.22 → 917.54] You have to do some fun stuff.
[917.54 → 921.22] Going for a performance all the time is awesome, and I'm doing that with my current computer.
[921.62 → 921.80] Right.
[921.82 → 925.76] And I want to always have one of those, but it's fun to also have little fun project computers
[925.76 → 926.16] as well.
[926.98 → 927.38] Okay.
[927.54 → 927.96] All right.
[928.02 → 931.66] Well, I think that you and I can agree to disagree about your bad idea.
[931.98 → 933.62] But we can both agree is terrible.
[935.50 → 936.78] It's not the great...
[936.78 → 939.10] I'm just going to cover you up with three questions now.
[940.52 → 942.12] Okay, let's move on.
[942.78 → 943.56] Okay, I think...
[943.56 → 943.88] Yeah, okay.
[944.02 → 944.66] Real conclusion.
[944.78 → 945.38] Real conclusion.
[945.38 → 946.54] I would never do...
[946.54 → 948.50] Okay, I told myself...
[948.50 → 948.78] I was...
[948.78 → 951.38] Because I have three PA120.3s upstairs.
[952.06 → 956.24] I have a baller pump that I paid like $250 for.
[956.64 → 959.38] And I was going to build myself like an outdoor...
[960.26 → 960.90] You showed me.
[961.04 → 962.58] Yeah, I showed you what I was going to do.
[962.74 → 968.64] So I was going to build myself a 120 by 9 rad box thing with the pump housing in it and all the
[968.64 → 970.66] like push-pull, and it was going to be awesome.
[971.04 → 976.26] And then I was going to run one set of tubing into like two computers that are next to each
[976.26 → 979.58] other and cool the whole thing because it'd have tons of heat capacity for it.
[979.58 → 986.90] And what I realized is that once you move into a house, your time gets consumed with like cleaning the kitchen.
[987.06 → 987.76] Well, you also have a baby.
[988.50 → 988.88] Well, yeah.
[988.94 → 993.16] But I didn't have a baby for the first year and a half that I was here.
[993.84 → 996.96] But it's just like there's so many stupid things.
[997.76 → 999.62] Like furniture shopping is the worst thing ever.
[999.74 → 1000.92] Like guys, am I right?
[1001.46 → 1003.78] Like furniture shopping is the stupidest thing ever.
[1003.78 → 1004.28] Like furniture.
[1005.46 → 1006.26] It's like horrible.
[1006.54 → 1007.14] I just don't do it.
[1007.20 → 1007.78] And when you take...
[1007.78 → 1009.74] Well, yeah, but you'll need furniture at some point.
[1010.50 → 1012.92] And like a girl will make you shop for furniture.
[1014.18 → 1015.32] Yeah, yeah, okay.
[1015.54 → 1022.66] And based on the feedback of our viewers last week, Slick should have no trouble attracting
[1022.66 → 1024.68] plenty of the ladies.
[1025.08 → 1027.86] At least if the ladies are our viewers.
[1028.16 → 1029.04] So check this out.
[1029.04 → 1034.40] We're going to do highlights of comments from last week's live stream.
[1034.84 → 1036.36] Always thought that Slick was a little...
[1036.36 → 1036.70] I'm going to...
[1036.70 → 1037.08] Here, you know what?
[1037.10 → 1040.52] I'm going to move this so you guys can all admire Slick while we do this.
[1040.86 → 1042.22] You have to sit up properly then.
[1042.32 → 1047.12] Always thought that Slick was like a little weak teenager that followed Linus around.
[1047.64 → 1048.00] Okay.
[1048.42 → 1049.20] Something, something.
[1049.70 → 1050.52] Something, something.
[1051.24 → 1051.92] Where's the...
[1051.92 → 1052.48] Here, hold on.
[1052.56 → 1052.88] Hold on.
[1053.32 → 1053.80] Where's the...
[1053.80 → 1054.00] Okay.
[1054.46 → 1055.06] Hot, hot.
[1055.06 → 1055.72] Oh, man.
[1055.82 → 1057.66] Why am I not a hot nerd like Slick?
[1057.66 → 1059.12] Hi, new guy.
[1059.24 → 1059.88] You're hot.
[1060.68 → 1062.68] Slick, so freaking hot.
[1062.80 → 1064.06] 42 thumbs up.
[1064.84 → 1065.52] Uh, hotel.
[1065.90 → 1066.12] No.
[1066.46 → 1067.36] Slick is hot.
[1067.74 → 1069.26] I can't decide who's hot or Linus.
[1069.38 → 1071.06] Yeah, see, one person gives me props.
[1071.34 → 1072.78] Thank you for that, viewer.
[1073.28 → 1074.20] Slick is hot.
[1074.36 → 1075.20] Slick's a hottie.
[1076.76 → 1077.24] Okay.
[1077.50 → 1077.86] Okay.
[1077.96 → 1079.98] Now let's try keyword Slick.
[1079.98 → 1080.02] Slick.
[1081.02 → 1083.58] Uh, okay, okay.
[1083.78 → 1085.52] Uh, okay, okay.
[1085.74 → 1086.62] Slick made me gay.
[1086.62 → 1088.08] Slick made me gay.
[1088.70 → 1089.26] Nice.
[1092.44 → 1093.84] Uh, Slick.
[1093.84 → 1095.68] DA-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[1095.90 → 1097.28] DA-da-da-da-da-da.
[1097.36 → 1098.28] Because, okay.
[1098.74 → 1099.58] Slick is hot.
[1099.72 → 1100.26] Slick's hot.
[1100.38 → 1101.12] Slick's big.
[1101.78 → 1103.36] Slick's big and manly and hot.
[1103.36 → 1109.00] So, uh, so I think that, uh, I think that sooner than later you should be running into
[1109.00 → 1112.54] a situation where, where you're, you're going to have to go shopping with a girl.
[1112.68 → 1112.88] Right.
[1113.02 → 1114.56] Mind you, you almost met a girl at school.
[1114.64 → 1115.44] Do you want to tell that story?
[1116.36 → 1117.28] Okay, okay, okay.
[1117.38 → 1119.66] I dated the same girl for about four and a half years.
[1119.94 → 1121.98] Uh, I got, that relationship ended.
[1122.24 → 1125.00] Went out with another girl for about four months that I was introduced to for a friend.
[1125.38 → 1130.10] So to give you a time frame, didn't, like, actively go and try and find women for about
[1130.10 → 1130.64] five years.
[1131.30 → 1133.24] Right, so you took her into men during that five years.
[1133.36 → 1137.66] My left arm, as you guys probably saw on the last livestream, was slung up.
[1137.74 → 1139.06] It still hurts like hell, but it's fine.
[1139.54 → 1142.46] Um, and I was walking down the hallway, and I was carrying something in my right hand.
[1142.84 → 1147.60] So I go, I have to go through one of the doors and, um, she opens the door for me.
[1148.04 → 1151.64] And I walk through, say thank you, and then she walks, like, right beside me down that
[1151.64 → 1153.18] completely empty corridor hallway.
[1153.36 → 1153.92] Oh, yeah, okay.
[1153.92 → 1157.88] So I'm like, I should probably say something, but I just keep walking, so I'm like, whatever.
[1158.34 → 1161.60] And then as I go to walk away, I'm like, okay, bye, and just walk down the hallway.
[1161.60 → 1162.92] Go buy two Nanaimo bars.
[1163.02 → 1163.86] I'm doing a project for school.
[1163.94 → 1165.10] I had to take pictures of Nanaimo bars.
[1165.66 → 1166.48] Start pulling them back.
[1166.58 → 1168.82] Seriously? That's what passes for post-secondary education now?
[1168.82 → 1169.50] It's pretty sad.
[1169.56 → 1172.62] We're in this, like, full programming course and we have digital media.
[1173.14 → 1175.54] And it's just, like, making web pages and stuff.
[1175.80 → 1178.84] Me and my partner decided to make web pages about Nanaimo bars and vanishes, so we had
[1178.84 → 1179.70] excuses to buy them.
[1179.70 → 1184.64] Anyway, so I'm coming back down the hallway, and she's still there.
[1184.96 → 1187.06] So when I come back, I'm like, oh, hey, do you want a Nanaimo bar?
[1187.38 → 1188.82] And she's like, oh, sure, blah, blah, blah.
[1188.92 → 1190.80] And we stand there for a second, she eats a Nanaimo bar.
[1191.12 → 1193.82] And I'm like, okay, bye, and just walk away.
[1196.22 → 1199.68] And she was, like, looking at me expectantly, like, I'm supposed to say something, and I
[1199.68 → 1200.78] definitely should have said something.
[1200.92 → 1203.48] And you were going to totally get, like, sympathy attention.
[1203.48 → 1206.34] Oh, it was, like, the perfect storm of good situations.
[1206.40 → 1207.20] Arm in a sling.
[1207.32 → 1210.14] Oh, but to be clear, she was, like, hideous and nerdy, right?
[1210.32 → 1210.54] No.
[1210.68 → 1210.98] No.
[1211.16 → 1211.70] Yeah, see?
[1211.90 → 1212.14] No.
[1212.84 → 1216.74] So Slick may be as hot as you guys think he is, but he's, uh...
[1216.74 → 1217.78] I've been out of the game for a while.
[1217.88 → 1220.00] He's been out of the game for a while.
[1221.40 → 1224.36] Yeah, my theory is that had nothing to do with it.
[1224.40 → 1226.14] He's just not really into that sort of thing.
[1227.64 → 1230.18] Which is fine, which is good, you know?
[1231.66 → 1232.24] That's cool.
[1232.24 → 1233.90] What do you think of the H80i?
[1234.00 → 1235.98] I think it's an H80 with an on the end.
[1236.16 → 1237.64] I think the new mounting should be good.
[1237.74 → 1239.42] I think that performance should be pretty similar.
[1241.00 → 1245.78] Ah, got a Z9PED8 mobile with LSI controller.
[1245.88 → 1247.08] What kind of storage array should I get?
[1247.28 → 1250.98] Honestly, hard to answer that question, because it really depends on what you need.
[1251.34 → 1254.00] Are you looking for mass storage, in which case you want hard drives?
[1254.06 → 1257.16] Are you looking for ball and SSDs, in which case get SSDs?
[1257.62 → 1258.24] Sorry, guys.
[1258.24 → 1261.16] We are announcing the winners of the Nerd Rage giveaway later tonight.
[1261.16 → 1265.46] We will do the final judging later tonight, and we will get that done for you.
[1265.54 → 1267.46] We'll start watching them immediately after.
[1267.58 → 1269.24] Yeah, yeah, we'll start watching them right away after.
[1269.32 → 1269.52] Okay.
[1269.86 → 1274.52] I'm almost afraid to click this link, because it can never be a good thing to click random
[1274.52 → 1276.38] links that people on the internet send you.
[1276.38 → 1277.74] But, uh...
[1277.74 → 1279.52] Oh, oh, oh...
[1279.52 → 1280.48] Oh...
[1280.48 → 1291.40] Okay, well, we just got trolled pretty good right there.
[1291.76 → 1293.18] Sorry for that, guys.
[1293.34 → 1294.70] That was not a good thing.
[1296.10 → 1297.44] Okay, Shane, you're banned.
[1297.74 → 1298.68] How do I ban people?
[1299.20 → 1300.62] I don't know how to ban people.
[1302.46 → 1304.66] Shane, full profile.
[1304.78 → 1305.76] He has three tweets.
[1306.88 → 1307.72] Yeah, he's banned.
[1308.00 → 1308.52] Blocked.
[1309.08 → 1309.50] Bam!
[1309.72 → 1310.08] Okay.
[1310.48 → 1311.58] Can you please announce the winners?
[1311.76 → 1312.38] I'm sorry.
[1312.52 → 1312.92] We will.
[1313.04 → 1313.52] We will.
[1314.24 → 1314.72] Livestream.
[1314.82 → 1315.28] I'm watching.
[1315.48 → 1316.80] Will these water cooling parts go good?
[1316.90 → 1317.48] Sorry, Freddy.
[1317.58 → 1318.96] No time to look at that right now.
[1320.42 → 1321.22] Okay, here.
[1321.34 → 1321.86] Good question.
[1322.52 → 1325.70] Why are you trying to increase the professionalism of your show?
[1325.96 → 1327.14] Some viewers like it as is.
[1327.22 → 1327.50] Personal.
[1328.24 → 1331.34] So, I guess I'll field this one.
[1331.48 → 1333.84] So, there is a need for both things.
[1333.84 → 1337.18] I don't know if you guys all know this, but I maintain two channels.
[1337.18 → 1343.62] My personal one, Linus Tech Tips, as well as a second one, NCI Comm for NCI, the store that I work at.
[1344.06 → 1350.74] It's a different viewer base, and people have a different expectation for the kind of content they want, the kind of professionalism level.
[1350.74 → 1355.26] So, I am not going to stop making casual videos.
[1355.68 → 1369.38] In fact, if you've noticed, for every experiment or professional style video I upload, I also am continuing to upload every single day one of my normal style content videos.
[1369.38 → 1374.14] So, it's not like I'm dialling back the production on the videos that you guys like.
[1374.40 → 1376.46] I'm just increasing what I'm doing.
[1377.00 → 1378.62] Why am I renovating my garage?
[1378.76 → 1379.98] Why did I invest in new equipment?
[1380.48 → 1381.92] That will become clear later.
[1382.14 → 1385.00] I can tell you right now that Slick and I are going to be at CES this year.
[1385.06 → 1386.52] We're going to be doing some really cool coverage.
[1387.00 → 1390.78] That's going to involve the new equipment as well, and there are lots of cool projects coming up.
[1391.18 → 1393.72] But, can't say more for now.
[1393.92 → 1394.80] So, there you go.
[1395.40 → 1395.96] But don't worry.
[1396.24 → 1396.62] Don't worry.
[1396.62 → 1398.66] The good stuff you like is not going away.
[1400.14 → 1402.02] You should switch jobs for a day.
[1402.42 → 1404.34] Slick as presenter and Linus as cameraman.
[1405.78 → 1406.78] Not a bad idea.
[1407.44 → 1408.54] Linus Tech and Slick PC.
[1408.66 → 1410.16] Who wins in an arm wrestling match?
[1410.28 → 1410.62] Seriously?
[1411.10 → 1414.44] Okay, let's just do a quick bicep comparison here.
[1415.00 → 1415.50] Yeah, see?
[1416.34 → 1417.26] Here, here, here, here.
[1417.52 → 1419.44] That should be pretty much all you need to know.
[1420.30 → 1424.90] I think his forearm is probably about the same size.
[1424.90 → 1426.34] Here, just put it next to it.
[1426.76 → 1429.18] Yeah, his forearm is bigger than my bicep.
[1429.38 → 1434.46] So, that, yeah, is not something that is that great.
[1434.68 → 1439.16] You know what I found out, actually, not that long ago, is Slick's kind of bully.
[1439.84 → 1447.80] He was telling me about this roommate he had at the University of Victoria that he used to throw at the wall.
[1447.80 → 1451.12] Pick him up and throw him at the wall.
[1451.44 → 1453.40] Can you explain why you might do such a thing?
[1454.20 → 1455.30] Football players, right?
[1455.30 → 1457.50] I'm usually quite a nice guy.
[1457.70 → 1460.24] I've never had someone I would call a mortal enemy before.
[1460.24 → 1470.80] But when you get drunk and pick up my mineral oil computer and drop it and crack the whole non-replaceable case and are the reason why it dies later down the line.
[1470.80 → 1472.80] I'm kind of mad.
[1472.80 → 1473.80] I'm kind of mad.
[1473.80 → 1474.80] I'm kind of mad.
[1474.80 → 1476.80] So what you're saying is you've got a temper.
[1476.80 → 1479.64] It can be triggered.
[1479.76 → 1481.58] So you threw him at the wall.
[1482.26 → 1483.98] Did he do anything else to deserve this?
[1484.88 → 1486.84] Yes, he did many things.
[1487.78 → 1490.44] I'm not entirely sure if we could go through this.
[1490.44 → 1495.68] I used to have my desktop in my buddy Harrison's dorm.
[1496.16 → 1498.14] He threw rocks through our window once.
[1499.50 → 1502.60] Hitting both of our monitors, which is beyond not okay.
[1504.96 → 1505.64] There's what?
[1505.80 → 1506.12] Okay.
[1507.22 → 1508.96] I really don't think I should go through that.
[1509.32 → 1510.58] There's another huge reason.
[1510.78 → 1511.94] Why don't we just put it this way?
[1512.02 → 1513.22] It involved a tie on the door.
[1513.42 → 1513.78] Yes.
[1514.08 → 1516.16] And someone entering who should not have entered.
[1516.62 → 1516.94] Right.
[1516.94 → 1520.70] So you're saying that he deserved to be thrown at the wall.
[1520.80 → 1523.34] He definitely deserved to be thrown at the wall.
[1523.88 → 1525.32] He also attacked me first.
[1526.36 → 1526.46] Yeah.
[1529.66 → 1534.68] I don't think I have my email with all of my planned topics here.
[1534.76 → 1536.06] So I'm going to have to open up my Gmail.
[1536.26 → 1539.20] So I'm going to get Slick to bring up one of his topics for the live stream tonight.
[1539.90 → 1541.84] And don't worry, we've got some good stuff.
[1542.02 → 1542.52] Dan the Man.
[1542.94 → 1544.10] Yes, Dan the Man.
[1544.28 → 1544.56] Okay.
[1544.56 → 1545.92] I hope he's still watching.
[1545.92 → 1551.62] Dan the Man, if you're on the Twitch chat, I want you to say something if you're there
[1551.62 → 1554.10] because you are awesome.
[1554.42 → 1556.10] You are Dan the Man.
[1556.22 → 1561.70] And you are the man because we, honestly, Slick and I have been super busy today.
[1561.84 → 1566.64] We haven't had as much time to pay attention to our Twitter as we would like.
[1567.34 → 1569.02] Everyone's saying they're Dan the Man now.
[1569.92 → 1570.06] So.
[1570.70 → 1571.20] Oh, yeah.
[1571.24 → 1571.72] There's a couple.
[1572.08 → 1575.48] Go back to the tweets from before the live stream started.
[1575.48 → 1576.28] You should be able to find them.
[1576.28 → 1577.10] I can't.
[1577.14 → 1578.08] I won't be able to find them.
[1578.26 → 1578.56] All right.
[1578.82 → 1580.18] But yeah, whoever.
[1580.44 → 1580.60] Okay.
[1580.68 → 1581.22] Dan the Man.
[1581.32 → 1586.88] If you're actually here, you're awesome because Dan was taking care of all the people asking
[1586.88 → 1588.30] when the live stream was starting.
[1588.38 → 1589.86] Although we didn't end up starting at that time.
[1589.92 → 1590.16] No.
[1590.42 → 1591.00] Sorry, Dan.
[1591.78 → 1592.40] Sorry, Dan.
[1592.46 → 1594.00] We made you look dumb, unfortunately.
[1594.00 → 1600.36] And he was also taking care of all the people who were asking about how to join the live
[1600.36 → 1600.62] stream.
[1600.76 → 1601.72] So that was awesome.
[1601.84 → 1603.32] He replied to like a ton of tweets.
[1603.82 → 1604.80] So thank you, Dan.
[1605.12 → 1605.80] What else we got?
[1607.00 → 1607.86] Vimeo tip jar.
[1608.52 → 1609.72] Oh, Vimeo tip jar.
[1609.88 → 1610.10] Okay.
[1610.72 → 1611.72] Have you guys heard of this?
[1611.78 → 1612.40] Have you heard of this?
[1612.48 → 1612.64] No.
[1612.98 → 1613.28] Okay.
[1613.54 → 1613.82] All right.
[1613.90 → 1616.74] We brought, like I just told him the topic, but I didn't actually give him the details.
[1616.88 → 1621.20] So Vimeo has introduced what's called a tip jar for content creators.
[1621.84 → 1628.40] And so instead of being an ad driven thing, and instead of being like, oh, her de deep de
[1628.40 → 1628.70] deep.
[1628.88 → 1635.32] Like, I know there was one tech video guy on YouTube that used to turn off comments on
[1635.32 → 1640.24] all of his videos and just say, if you want to comment on the video, go to my website.
[1640.24 → 1644.16] So he was trying to drive traffic away from YouTube, which is very difficult to do.
[1645.32 → 1649.38] You know if you want to go to my website and view, and then he gets like advertising
[1649.38 → 1650.26] revenue there.
[1650.90 → 1653.58] So that's, that was one way to get money.
[1653.74 → 1654.86] And it's just not very effective.
[1654.94 → 1656.00] And people don't like it.
[1656.20 → 1662.44] Whereas if you make it voluntary, I don't think people have a problem saying, you know,
[1662.48 → 1664.60] hey, this is someone that I enjoy watching.
[1665.16 → 1667.96] And, you know, here's a dollar or here are two dollars.
[1667.96 → 1674.08] I mean, it's a good platform, especially for tip based stuff.
[1674.30 → 1677.04] So like, you don't know how to do something, you look it up, they answered your question.
[1677.24 → 1677.42] Yeah.
[1677.42 → 1678.72] Oh, there's a buck or two.
[1678.82 → 1678.98] Yeah.
[1679.08 → 1681.38] I mean, it's something that for what I'm doing online is tech tips.
[1681.46 → 1682.88] It probably doesn't make that much sense.
[1682.94 → 1687.46] I don't think people will tip me for unboxing, like, you know, my apple juice.
[1687.46 → 1696.06] But for something like where, or even like comics or people who are producing web series,
[1696.32 → 1697.48] that could be just awesome.
[1697.66 → 1700.04] Like, what's his name?
[1700.12 → 1700.52] Freddie Wong.
[1701.02 → 1701.28] Yeah.
[1701.40 → 1701.90] Someone like Freddie Wong.
[1701.90 → 1703.10] Freddie Wong's videos are epic.
[1703.44 → 1703.56] Yeah.
[1703.56 → 1705.74] And yeah, they deserve, they deserve credit.
[1706.62 → 1708.82] I mean, Freddie Wong, I think, is doing okay for himself.
[1708.86 → 1709.16] Yeah.
[1709.30 → 1710.04] I'm sure he is.
[1710.10 → 1710.84] Aside from that.
[1710.84 → 1711.86] Yeah, but still.
[1713.94 → 1715.34] But yeah, I think it's a great idea.
[1715.44 → 1722.68] I mean, that's, the problem is I don't see realistically anyone but YouTube actually ending up existing
[1722.68 → 1723.52] at the end of all this.
[1724.20 → 1725.42] Vimeo's been around for quite a while.
[1725.48 → 1725.80] I know.
[1725.88 → 1726.82] Vimeo's, I mean, okay, okay.
[1726.96 → 1728.66] Vimeo's been around for, they're not even number two, though.
[1729.64 → 1732.84] Number two is Dailymotion.
[1733.60 → 1734.08] Oh, yeah.
[1734.26 → 1738.52] Yeah, Dailymotion, I think, is about a quarter the size of YouTube or something like that.
[1738.52 → 1744.48] And it's, I mean, for the North American viewers, you know, hey, feel free to tweet at us or,
[1744.60 → 1749.86] or actually here, well, we'll have a quick look at the okay, the Twitch chat has disappeared.
[1750.04 → 1750.74] There it is.
[1751.00 → 1752.44] We'll have a quick look at the Twitch chat.
[1753.32 → 1758.24] And guys, what, what was I saying?
[1760.20 → 1761.98] You're saying that Dailymotion was number two.
[1762.00 → 1762.20] Yeah.
[1762.26 → 1764.26] Have you ever watched a video on Dailymotion?
[1764.42 → 1766.24] I think it's more of a European thing.
[1766.24 → 1772.68] And, uh, here, we'll, uh, we'll go back to, we'll go back to the Twitch chat and let you guys, uh, let you guys see what you think.
[1772.78 → 1776.56] No, no, uh, lol, you porn.
[1776.80 → 1777.62] Come on, guys.
[1778.70 → 1779.06] Ah.
[1780.20 → 1782.50] No, Dailymotion is not a cheap ad site.
[1782.60 → 1785.86] It's actually, all of my videos get syndicated over to Dailymotion as well.
[1786.12 → 1792.34] But they don't get a lot of views over there just because no one, uh, oh, he says, oh, okay.
[1792.34 → 1799.26] Apparently, apparently, Dailymotion is popular because it has soft core porn on it.
[1802.32 → 1807.16] Apparently, that guy random shot TV video shows inappropriate videos as well.
[1807.52 → 1807.88] Oh.
[1808.32 → 1808.80] Okay.
[1808.94 → 1812.52] Well, I guess now we know why Dailymotion is one quarter of the size of YouTube.
[1812.52 → 1818.38] Because if YouTube wanted to double their traffic tomorrow, we know what they could do.
[1819.22 → 1820.52] I think that would have more than double it.
[1823.58 → 1825.02] Okay, then.
[1825.52 → 1827.22] Why don't we just move right along?
[1827.24 → 1827.44] All right.
[1827.54 → 1828.06] New topic.
[1828.18 → 1828.78] New topic.
[1829.86 → 1831.62] We're going to move away from that topic.
[1832.72 → 1833.12] Um.
[1833.12 → 1837.96] I wanted to make a comment about the Android tablet versus Apple tablet last stream.
[1838.22 → 1838.92] Oh, come on.
[1838.96 → 1839.94] You're not going to bring that up again.
[1840.02 → 1843.30] We were, okay, we were talking about performance and I got a bunch of tweets about people
[1843.30 → 1848.38] saying that they were now having a hard time deciding because they love their Android phone
[1848.38 → 1852.34] and they love their Android everything, and they're going to go buy a new Android tablet
[1852.34 → 1853.18] and now they're unsure.
[1853.58 → 1855.78] Because we said Android tablets aren't that great.
[1855.84 → 1856.92] Because they don't perform very well.
[1856.92 → 1863.94] But if you're a huge Android fan and love everything to do with Android, don't just go buy an Apple tablet
[1863.94 → 1864.56] because it's fast.
[1864.66 → 1865.16] Okay, hold on.
[1865.30 → 1865.92] But, uh, hold on.
[1866.46 → 1872.66] Okay, what you're about to say sounds an awful lot like, well, if you happen to be a huge
[1872.66 → 1876.24] Justin Bieber fan, you should probably download the Boyfriend single.
[1878.10 → 1878.70] Boyfriend single?
[1878.90 → 1879.78] Yeah, it's a terrible song.
[1879.98 → 1880.70] You know his songs?
[1881.26 → 1883.40] No, I listened to it because, uh.
[1883.42 → 1883.56] What?
[1884.64 → 1885.80] Why did you listen to it?
[1885.80 → 1886.90] I thought you were there.
[1887.58 → 1889.50] Remember, didn't I play it during, uh.
[1889.50 → 1890.00] I don't remember.
[1890.56 → 1891.80] We searched for it on YouTube.
[1891.96 → 1893.36] We were testing a tablet or something.
[1894.06 → 1894.60] Oh, this is being a while ago.
[1894.60 → 1896.56] And it was like the front page or something.
[1896.66 → 1898.30] So I was just like, oh, Justin Bieber, Boyfriend.
[1898.64 → 1899.98] And you were, I think, you were there.
[1900.10 → 1900.64] Yeah, you were there.
[1900.96 → 1902.32] You were like, oh, that's a terrible song.
[1902.36 → 1903.24] I'm like, it couldn't be that bad.
[1903.30 → 1903.90] It's Justin Bieber.
[1904.04 → 1904.50] It should be okay.
[1904.62 → 1906.10] It's Canadian and all that.
[1906.88 → 1908.20] But, uh, no, it was bad.
[1908.52 → 1909.40] It was not good.
[1909.54 → 1911.30] It was like, it was like bad.
[1911.38 → 1913.30] It was like, just bad.
[1913.30 → 1916.38] For the true Justin Bieber fans only.
[1917.26 → 1917.36] Right.
[1917.54 → 1918.74] You know what my mom was telling me?
[1919.16 → 1924.78] Is the surest way to find out if it's Justin Bieber's birthday is to go into any middle school.
[1925.20 → 1928.64] And if all the girls are wearing purple, then it's Justin Bieber's birthday.
[1928.84 → 1930.34] Because apparently it's his favourite colour.
[1930.72 → 1932.86] And all the tween girls wear purple on his birthday.
[1935.64 → 1937.00] Why don't you finish your story?
[1937.36 → 1938.66] I don't even remember what I was talking about.
[1938.66 → 1939.66] You were talking about how you...
[1939.66 → 1940.38] Oh, oh, oh.
[1940.38 → 1940.70] Yeah.
[1940.84 → 1944.38] Just, like, if you love the Android experience, if you're into rooting, if you're into changing
[1944.38 → 1946.84] out ROMs, if you're into all that kind of stuff, maybe don't change.
[1948.46 → 1949.66] Just buy an Android tablet.
[1950.30 → 1950.58] Okay.
[1950.70 → 1952.40] I mean, you can get faster Android tablets.
[1952.66 → 1955.38] Galaxy Note 10.1 is using a newer, faster processor.
[1955.68 → 1955.94] Right.
[1956.66 → 1957.56] It's a little heavy.
[1957.78 → 1959.08] But then again, so is iPad 3.
[1959.48 → 1961.28] I think, and 4, for that matter.
[1961.46 → 1962.62] The slightly faster one.
[1964.36 → 1964.68] Anyway.
[1965.50 → 1966.52] I can pull another topic.
[1966.62 → 1967.28] No, I got another one.
[1967.28 → 1971.34] So, The Verge did a fantastic article on AMD.
[1971.72 → 1974.74] We're not going to spend long on this one, but I'm just going to show this to you guys.
[1975.00 → 1976.90] If you're not familiar with The Verge, great site.
[1978.24 → 1979.30] Theverge.com.
[1980.66 → 1981.36] Actually, you know what?
[1981.38 → 1982.70] It's probably easier to just do this.
[1984.06 → 1984.94] Verge, AMD.
[1985.98 → 1987.22] What happened to AMD?
[1987.38 → 1993.40] This is a great look at what the heck happened to AMD over the last little while.
[1993.40 → 1998.88] I don't know if you guys have seen this, but AMD's stock is at pretty much an all-time low.
[1998.96 → 2004.30] I think there was one point in 2008 when the recession really, really hit that they were
[2004.30 → 2008.40] a little bit lower than this, but they're down to $1.86 per share.
[2008.90 → 2010.44] I don't know if you guys are going to be able to see this.
[2010.72 → 2011.80] It's going to focus or not.
[2011.80 → 2013.06] They can kind of see the line.
[2013.18 → 2014.02] Go Hero camera.
[2014.58 → 2014.80] Whatever.
[2014.94 → 2016.44] You can see the trend line on the bottom.
[2016.54 → 2017.50] That's kind of all you need to know.
[2017.72 → 2019.80] So, they're down to $1.86 per share.
[2019.94 → 2025.76] When they were riding high, I mean, it wasn't that long ago that every gamer had an Athlon
[2025.76 → 2028.72] 64 or an Athlon 64X2 in their ring.
[2028.92 → 2029.36] I had one.
[2029.58 → 2030.24] I had...
[2030.24 → 2030.74] I had...
[2030.74 → 2031.30] Blah.
[2031.30 → 2032.68] Actually, I technically had two.
[2033.22 → 2035.64] Here, let's see who had the most Athlon 64s.
[2035.70 → 2035.82] I had two.
[2036.26 → 2036.72] You had two?
[2036.86 → 2037.02] Yeah.
[2037.02 → 2038.22] I had a 3,000 plus.
[2038.68 → 2040.88] Then I upgraded to a 3,200 plus.
[2041.20 → 2043.18] Then I got a 3,500 plus.
[2043.48 → 2043.88] Claw hammer.
[2044.18 → 2044.36] Wow.
[2045.36 → 2047.22] Then I got a 4,400 plus.
[2047.74 → 2053.68] Then I got an Option 165, which was just a 4,400 plus, but it overclocked a little better.
[2054.80 → 2058.08] And I think from there I went to a Core 2 Duo.
[2058.68 → 2060.44] So, I had like five of them.
[2060.44 → 2060.68] Right.
[2061.30 → 2062.52] And that, yeah.
[2063.26 → 2065.30] So, I had a 754 rig.
[2065.38 → 2066.50] I had a 939 rig.
[2066.78 → 2067.42] I had several...
[2067.42 → 2069.02] How many boards did I have?
[2069.44 → 2071.64] I had an MSI 754 board.
[2072.06 → 2075.10] Then I had an ASUS 754 board.
[2075.58 → 2078.12] Then I had on 939, I had an ASUS one.
[2078.56 → 2079.68] Then I had an A-Bit one.
[2079.78 → 2080.02] All right.
[2080.14 → 2080.64] Oh, oh.
[2081.02 → 2082.78] Oh, I had an AS Rock one.
[2083.14 → 2087.46] Do you remember that Epic board that had AGP and PCI Express?
[2087.84 → 2088.08] Yeah, yeah.
[2088.08 → 2092.84] I had my X800 XT Platinum Edition AGP card in there.
[2093.00 → 2098.00] And then I was ready for my 7800 GT upgrade when I was done with that.
[2098.08 → 2101.14] My favourite board for FL64 was my DFI LAN Party.
[2101.30 → 2102.18] DFI LAN Party.
[2102.30 → 2102.50] Okay.
[2102.94 → 2103.68] You know what?
[2103.68 → 2106.68] It's probably the most legendary board that I've never owned.
[2107.00 → 2107.60] Yeah, yeah.
[2107.98 → 2109.76] Other than maybe like IC7 Max.
[2110.16 → 2110.52] Yeah.
[2110.52 → 2113.46] That's another like super legendary board.
[2114.22 → 2115.54] But anyway, sorry.
[2115.76 → 2117.56] So anyway, great article you guys.
[2118.36 → 2122.58] Do check it out because it's a perfect look at sort of what's happened over the last
[2122.58 → 2122.98] little while.
[2123.08 → 2124.24] What kind of new steps there have been.
[2124.30 → 2128.34] I mean, they went seven months without any clear leadership in the company, which is really
[2128.34 → 2128.96] hard to do.
[2129.12 → 2129.24] Yeah.
[2129.24 → 2131.20] And still know what's going on.
[2131.24 → 2135.22] They've gone through a 30% reduction in staff under a month ago.
[2136.02 → 2140.58] So it's, you know, I think we all hope for the sake of keeping Intel in line.
[2140.66 → 2144.90] I think we've seen what's happened over the last three years or so where we're getting like
[2144.90 → 2149.66] these small iterations on the CPU side.
[2149.66 → 2152.20] I mean, where's my eight core processor?
[2154.06 → 2154.78] It's there.
[2155.00 → 2156.92] They just haven't unlocked it because they don't have to.
[2158.00 → 2162.14] So, so yeah, I think we're all rooting for them, but it's tough right now.
[2162.60 → 2164.82] So yeah, moving right along.
[2164.92 → 2167.40] Let's go back to, wait, you had a topic, right?
[2167.90 → 2170.48] I've got a couple, but we can go back to Twitter or something.
[2172.32 → 2173.24] No, no, no.
[2173.26 → 2174.40] Let's, let's do that for now.
[2174.52 → 2175.12] I've got all this.
[2176.22 → 2177.48] Oh, holy crap.
[2177.54 → 2177.72] Yeah.
[2177.72 → 2178.98] We have a lot of topics.
[2179.66 → 2180.10] Okay.
[2180.50 → 2181.32] Oh yes.
[2181.44 → 2181.80] Okay.
[2182.30 → 2183.78] Explain this, the fourth one.
[2184.68 → 2189.50] And I think that, I think that we're all going to completely disagree with you because you're
[2189.50 → 2189.72] wrong.
[2190.48 → 2193.20] Actually, no, it's probably, probably they'll agree with you.
[2193.64 → 2193.88] Okay.
[2193.94 → 2195.08] So hackers versus crackers.
[2195.56 → 2197.16] I brought this up with Linus today.
[2197.82 → 2198.26] Okay.
[2198.30 → 2200.04] First, we should start with your position.
[2200.12 → 2201.30] What would you consider yourself?
[2201.86 → 2205.34] Just so you guys know, Slick's actually a lot more technical than me, especially on the
[2205.34 → 2206.02] software side.
[2206.02 → 2209.70] Like I can barely make something bold with HTML tags.
[2212.96 → 2213.40] What?
[2214.28 → 2215.46] I can't remember.
[2215.86 → 2220.18] I can never remember if it's like brackets and then the slash or if it's these things
[2220.18 → 2221.18] and then the slash.
[2221.46 → 2224.26] And sometimes it's one, and sometimes it's the other.
[2224.52 → 2225.06] W3 schools.
[2225.20 → 2226.26] You'll be done in like 10 minutes.
[2226.74 → 2227.02] What?
[2227.02 → 2229.10] W3 schools, amazing website.
[2229.24 → 2232.48] If you're looking into really basic starter coding, go there.
[2232.78 → 2233.66] Even more advanced stuff.
[2233.98 → 2234.44] They're perfect.
[2234.96 → 2237.36] Anyway, I would consider myself a hacker.
[2238.08 → 2238.40] Okay.
[2239.16 → 2240.78] Hackers are not bad.
[2240.86 → 2241.78] Yeah, you're a bad person.
[2241.86 → 2242.10] No.
[2242.20 → 2246.12] So you're basically one of those, you're one of those jackasses who's in like Call of Duty.
[2246.48 → 2246.66] No.
[2246.66 → 2247.52] And like running around.
[2247.52 → 2247.80] No.
[2248.42 → 2248.90] No.
[2249.56 → 2252.20] Wrong terminology is used almost all the time.
[2253.28 → 2256.40] Most of the Call of Duty guys are what's called the script kitty.
[2256.58 → 2260.26] They're just using programs written by other people and those other people are crackers.
[2260.74 → 2263.52] Crackers are people that attack things and try to...
[2264.06 → 2264.50] Correction.
[2264.62 → 2265.54] Crackers are white people.
[2265.80 → 2266.22] Go ahead.
[2266.68 → 2269.52] Crackers are people who try to attack things and try to...
[2269.52 → 2271.72] Why are you generalizing about my people?
[2277.16 → 2278.78] Sorry, I'm racist against white people.
[2279.82 → 2282.52] I can understand that because you're clearly not white yourself.
[2284.24 → 2284.68] Clearly.
[2285.88 → 2286.92] What was I even going to say?
[2287.16 → 2289.74] Yeah, crackers are people that will attack something maliciously.
[2290.02 → 2295.16] Hackers are people that will take something and try to change it in certain ways to make it better.
[2295.16 → 2298.88] Okay, but do they ever do this to their own advantage?
[2299.52 → 2301.34] Well, that's kind of the point all the time.
[2301.44 → 2304.58] Okay, but is it ever to the detriment of whoever they're...
[2304.58 → 2306.96] If it's to the detriment of someone else, you're cracking.
[2307.18 → 2307.74] You're cracking.
[2308.32 → 2310.52] Because it should never really influence anyone else.
[2311.02 → 2313.24] Okay, what if it was a tiny influence?
[2313.72 → 2320.88] Like what if, say for example, you were gaining access to someone's Wi-Fi or something.
[2320.88 → 2321.94] You cracked into their Wi-Fi.
[2322.12 → 2323.34] You cracked into their Wi-Fi.
[2323.68 → 2326.02] Okay, what if you gained access to...
[2326.02 → 2328.16] You cracked the password to get into their Wi-Fi.
[2328.44 → 2328.74] Okay.
[2328.74 → 2330.74] So...
[2331.96 → 2338.74] What if you gained access to a folder somehow, and you never actually looked at any of the files in it?
[2338.82 → 2339.78] Are you a hacker or a cracker?
[2340.08 → 2343.92] That's gaining access to something that you're not allowed access to.
[2343.96 → 2344.20] Okay.
[2344.34 → 2344.62] That's cracking.
[2344.72 → 2345.26] That's cracking.
[2345.38 → 2348.86] So what do hackers even do then, besides sit on their thumbs and theorize?
[2348.86 → 2350.06] Well, like Arduino controllers.
[2350.18 → 2351.36] Have you ever heard of an Arduino controller?
[2351.36 → 2352.36] Someone...
[2352.36 → 2356.36] It's this like little electronic board that you can...
[2356.36 → 2359.20] You hack with it and make little things for yourself.
[2359.82 → 2360.06] Mm-hmm.
[2360.78 → 2362.06] So have you made any of those?
[2362.60 → 2363.88] Not personally, but I'd like to.
[2364.20 → 2364.50] Okay.
[2364.72 → 2366.00] You can make like little random things.
[2366.08 → 2368.20] You can connect it to your washing machine.
[2368.20 → 2371.28] So that'll email you when your wash is done.
[2372.36 → 2373.74] Like random little stuff like that.
[2374.50 → 2374.92] But then...
[2374.92 → 2375.62] That's hacking then.
[2375.72 → 2376.76] That's not just coding.
[2377.32 → 2377.50] Yeah.
[2378.20 → 2379.20] But then it's coding.
[2379.32 → 2380.46] Like there's so many different...
[2380.46 → 2382.46] It's so confusing because there's a lot of different terminology.
[2382.84 → 2385.70] There's also black hat, gray hat, and white-hat hackers.
[2385.70 → 2387.98] And then white-hat hackers are good hackers.
[2388.44 → 2391.18] Gray hat hackers are kind of in between.
[2391.38 → 2392.66] And then black-hat hackers are bad.
[2393.12 → 2395.70] And then the blue hat hackers are...
[2396.44 → 2397.42] That's the intel team.
[2397.56 → 2401.48] Taking the ability of the monsters and turning it around and using it on them.
[2402.90 → 2404.30] Oh no, I'm thinking mages.
[2404.40 → 2404.86] Yeah, yeah.
[2405.14 → 2405.88] Okay, sorry.
[2405.94 → 2407.30] It's really confusing, but yeah.
[2407.38 → 2408.90] That's basically just what we were talking about today.
[2409.24 → 2409.56] Okay.
[2410.26 → 2410.86] So what...
[2410.86 → 2412.56] So basically hackers are mages.
[2414.12 → 2414.52] Yeah.
[2414.84 → 2415.24] Okay.
[2415.70 → 2416.88] And computers are magic.
[2417.62 → 2419.18] And then if the blue dust...
[2419.18 → 2422.12] If the blue smoke comes out, then the magic is gone.
[2422.20 → 2423.72] It has been released, and it can't work anymore.
[2423.76 → 2426.24] The power that comes from the wall and your power supply is mana.
[2426.78 → 2428.66] Your power supply is your mana pool.
[2430.18 → 2431.10] Yeah, there you go.
[2431.16 → 2434.94] So from now on, we no longer do unboxing of power supplies.
[2436.14 → 2442.80] This is officially a 1250 watt mana source.
[2443.06 → 2443.16] Yeah.
[2443.60 → 2443.92] Okay.
[2443.92 → 2444.36] Okay.
[2444.46 → 2450.76] So to be clear, if I just hook this up to you, like, would that do anything?
[2451.02 → 2451.94] Or does it have to have the blue smoke?
[2451.94 → 2454.80] See, but I'm like a summoner from League of Legends.
[2455.30 → 2455.56] Okay.
[2455.64 → 2458.14] I utilize someone who would utilize this.
[2458.22 → 2460.60] And the thing that I utilize that utilizes this is the computer.
[2460.80 → 2461.10] Right.
[2461.30 → 2461.56] Right.
[2461.56 → 2464.00] But the computer has to contain the magic blue smoke.
[2464.14 → 2464.40] Yeah.
[2465.04 → 2465.48] Got it.
[2465.54 → 2466.98] Do you contain magic blue smoke?
[2467.22 → 2467.98] Unfortunately, no.
[2468.08 → 2468.56] Are you sure?
[2468.78 → 2470.34] Because I conveniently have a knife on him.
[2470.34 → 2474.52] What else is there?
[2474.52 → 2477.66] Do you think he'd hit me if I just, like, jabbed him?
[2478.62 → 2479.04] You know what?
[2479.14 → 2479.72] Let's...
[2479.72 → 2483.36] He'd probably throw me at the wall because he's a big bully.
[2483.86 → 2484.10] Okay.
[2484.10 → 2485.46] Let's do some Twitter questions here.
[2486.60 → 2489.04] You can find other topics while we're looking at some Twitter questions.
[2489.04 → 2489.90] I've already got other topics.
[2490.16 → 2490.52] Okay.
[2490.62 → 2491.76] Someone loves Arduino.
[2492.06 → 2492.54] There you go.
[2492.66 → 2493.54] He found...
[2493.54 → 2493.74] Yay!
[2493.74 → 2494.88] Duncan Chanukah.
[2495.40 → 2497.04] Thank you for agreeing with Slick.
[2498.26 → 2498.92] W3 School.
[2499.08 → 2499.44] W3 School's the best.
[2499.46 → 2499.58] Yeah.
[2500.58 → 2500.98] All right.
[2501.06 → 2501.34] Curtis.
[2501.60 → 2504.78] What are your three favourite games?
[2506.04 → 2506.56] Go.
[2507.08 → 2507.86] My three favourite games?
[2507.88 → 2508.12] Yeah.
[2508.34 → 2508.82] Yeah.
[2508.82 → 2509.76] Your three favourite games.
[2510.42 → 2510.90] Borrowing.
[2511.58 → 2512.10] Bastion.
[2513.62 → 2514.10] Bastion.
[2515.68 → 2516.28] And...
[2516.28 → 2516.82] Assassin's Creed?
[2517.50 → 2517.94] Yeah.
[2518.72 → 2521.06] But I'm trying to pick an individual Assassin's Creed.
[2521.24 → 2521.70] So that's all like...
[2521.70 → 2523.36] If I can answer series,
[2523.74 → 2524.82] I know it's all RPGs.
[2525.06 → 2526.22] But the thing is with shooters,
[2526.46 → 2528.12] with shooters it moves so quickly.
[2528.82 → 2530.26] There are new shooters all the time.
[2530.26 → 2530.50] Okay.
[2530.54 → 2533.12] But there's no shooter you could single out as being like your favourite shooter.
[2533.74 → 2534.02] Like...
[2534.02 → 2534.32] Okay.
[2534.32 → 2535.24] If I had to pick a shooter,
[2535.24 → 2540.30] I would probably say either CS 1.6 or Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
[2540.40 → 2541.66] Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
[2542.22 → 2542.78] One of those two.
[2543.06 → 2543.50] Really?
[2543.76 → 2547.04] COD 4 Modern Warfare 3 favourite games?
[2547.84 → 2548.06] No.
[2548.06 → 2548.30] No.
[2548.46 → 2548.54] No.
[2548.56 → 2549.16] You ask shooters.
[2549.26 → 2550.70] This is all newer stuff though.
[2550.72 → 2550.74] Yeah.
[2550.74 → 2551.04] You ask shooters specifically.
[2551.22 → 2553.72] You don't have any like more classic games that are your favourite games?
[2553.74 → 2554.74] Yeah.
[2554.74 → 2555.74] I mean...
[2555.74 → 2556.40] Okay, here.
[2556.40 → 2557.56] Why don't I start with my three favourite games?
[2557.56 → 2558.46] We didn't have much money though.
[2558.46 → 2561.12] I didn't get very many games until I was quite a bit older.
[2561.12 → 2561.32] Okay.
[2561.42 → 2562.04] To be clear,
[2562.52 → 2563.40] I owned...
[2563.40 → 2564.96] For my Super Nintendo...
[2564.96 → 2565.30] Again,
[2565.42 → 2566.16] like we didn't...
[2566.16 → 2567.44] We didn't have a ton of money growing up.
[2567.56 → 2568.86] I owned Super Mario World,
[2569.62 → 2571.02] Final Fantasy 3 or 6,
[2571.48 → 2572.32] and Pilotings.
[2572.32 → 2577.30] I actually only owned three games for my Super Nintendo the entire time I owned the console.
[2578.22 → 2581.98] But, but, but, but, they were probably the best games for that console.
[2582.26 → 2582.70] There's...
[2582.70 → 2583.04] There's...
[2583.04 → 2587.02] The problem is I've played so many games that I cherish so much that it would be easier
[2587.02 → 2589.02] to ask like, what is your favourite game of this genre?
[2589.20 → 2590.70] Or what is your favourite game for this console?
[2590.86 → 2593.00] Or what is your favourite game for all this other stuff?
[2593.04 → 2594.18] Because like Lost Vikings...
[2594.18 → 2594.96] Did you ever play Lost Vikings?
[2595.18 → 2596.20] I actually didn't.
[2596.44 → 2597.84] Lost Vikings was amazing.
[2598.32 → 2599.38] I loved that game.
[2599.84 → 2600.92] Lost Vikings was so good.
[2600.92 → 2603.46] We owned Super Mario World and Lost Vikings.
[2603.98 → 2604.22] Okay.
[2604.50 → 2605.16] And that was like...
[2605.16 → 2605.40] Okay.
[2606.30 → 2607.46] Super Mario World was kind of...
[2607.46 → 2610.54] You know, we should get together, and we should just plow through Super Mario World sometime.
[2610.76 → 2612.28] We could probably stream it.
[2612.42 → 2613.76] That would actually be kind of amazing.
[2613.88 → 2614.08] Okay.
[2614.38 → 2615.46] We'd love you guys' input.
[2615.70 → 2618.38] Do you want to see me and Slick finish to 96?
[2618.66 → 2619.46] That's the max, right?
[2619.56 → 2620.24] I think it's 96.
[2620.54 → 2621.00] I think so.
[2621.08 → 2621.66] I think it's 96.
[2621.82 → 2624.74] Finish to 96, Super Mario World, and one long gaming session.
[2624.98 → 2625.58] Let us know.
[2625.96 → 2626.72] We can stream it.
[2626.78 → 2628.20] We have the Aver Media card.
[2628.20 → 2630.82] The Aver Media card can stream SNES, I think.
[2631.28 → 2631.86] There's a dongle.
[2631.94 → 2633.64] Or if not, the Black Magic can.
[2634.16 → 2634.42] Cool.
[2634.72 → 2634.88] Yeah.
[2634.98 → 2636.94] There's a dongle kit that comes with it.
[2637.02 → 2637.30] Okay, so...
[2637.30 → 2639.88] Either way, we could get a TV without and just push.
[2640.50 → 2641.20] Oh, can we do that?
[2641.36 → 2641.86] I'm pretty sure.
[2642.26 → 2643.60] I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure.
[2643.72 → 2645.58] I want to use a CRT if we can.
[2645.88 → 2646.64] That would be way more legit.
[2646.64 → 2647.10] I know.
[2647.22 → 2647.72] I know.
[2647.72 → 2648.68] I've got one at home.
[2648.90 → 2649.16] I know.
[2649.16 → 2649.74] I know you have one.
[2649.98 → 2650.68] Well, wait, like...
[2650.68 → 2651.24] I was...
[2651.24 → 2651.80] Okay, guys.
[2652.14 → 2653.90] Huge problem with modern LCDs.
[2653.92 → 2654.92] This drives me crazy.
[2655.40 → 2657.08] There is so much input lag.
[2657.58 → 2658.34] I mean...
[2658.34 → 2663.34] I was looking into IPS monitors last night and found one that I was really interested in.
[2663.62 → 2664.46] 18 milliseconds.
[2665.50 → 2666.56] I was like, oh, no.
[2666.56 → 2671.72] But the specs are meaningless because I guarantee you that if it says 18 milliseconds, it's like
[2671.72 → 2672.58] 50 milliseconds.
[2672.76 → 2672.90] Yeah.
[2672.98 → 2673.86] Or 80 milliseconds.
[2674.02 → 2674.16] Yeah.
[2674.40 → 2675.58] Because the specs don't mean anything.
[2675.88 → 2678.54] And honestly, monitors are fast enough for me now.
[2678.98 → 2680.38] I can get by with a monitor.
[2680.38 → 2685.76] Like my wife's old 24-05 FPW, that one is a little bit slow for me.
[2685.98 → 2687.78] And the pixel response times are a little bit slow.
[2687.86 → 2693.48] But even my 305T, which is not a fast monitor, I can live with something like a 24-20T, the
[2693.48 → 2693.92] BenQ one.
[2693.98 → 2696.06] Have you ever noticed any problem with it?
[2696.06 → 2696.16] Not really.
[2696.16 → 2697.40] Lightning fast.
[2697.48 → 2701.04] But then the thing is, you go back to old consoles, and it almost doesn't even matter.
[2701.26 → 2704.70] It has to be the shortest input lag possible.
[2704.76 → 2708.46] I think we could probably play on a 120Hz monitor.
[2708.92 → 2711.56] But on TVs, it's terrible.
[2712.10 → 2712.96] Like it's unplayable.
[2713.06 → 2719.04] I was playing Mario on the TV that's over there, Super Mario World, and I was like, jump,
[2719.56 → 2723.68] adjust in midair, and then it's like, second later, adjust in midair.
[2723.68 → 2726.84] Like it's so modern games have gotten crappier.
[2727.14 → 2727.60] And you know what?
[2727.60 → 2729.30] You can't even blame it just on consoles.
[2729.70 → 2731.26] Because Super Nintendo is a console.
[2731.92 → 2732.10] Yeah.
[2732.16 → 2733.16] No, it's the TVs.
[2733.64 → 2734.80] It's not even just TVs.
[2735.14 → 2735.66] A couple of things.
[2736.66 → 2737.78] Input lag on TVs.
[2738.70 → 2739.06] Hold on.
[2739.20 → 2740.14] Let me see if I have one here.
[2740.78 → 2741.52] Yeah, I don't have one.
[2741.78 → 2742.62] Wireless controllers.
[2742.62 → 2743.20] Wireless controllers, yeah.
[2743.46 → 2744.16] Wireless controllers.
[2744.26 → 2746.82] Back when we had CRT TVs for instant...
[2746.82 → 2748.22] I feel ancient right now.
[2748.22 → 2759.22] Well, back in my day, we had CRTs, and we had the scan line, and the motion blur, and the...
[2759.22 → 2760.90] Pilot wings.
[2761.78 → 2763.00] My pilot wings.
[2763.12 → 2764.62] Pilot wings was a great game.
[2764.76 → 2764.98] Don't even...
[2764.98 → 2766.20] I'm not talking it down.
[2766.38 → 2767.92] Don't be down on pilot wings.
[2768.06 → 2769.14] Because screw you.
[2769.62 → 2770.70] That's what I say.
[2772.04 → 2772.88] Screw you.
[2773.22 → 2774.36] Pilot wings is amazing.
[2774.36 → 2782.72] I love how we're crazy, high-end hardware enthusiasts, and our first gaming livestream is going to be Super Mario.
[2783.06 → 2786.30] That's because Super Mario World is one of the most hardcore games ever.
[2786.76 → 2786.98] Yeah.
[2787.72 → 2788.70] Actually, okay, I would...
[2788.70 → 2789.70] They still do speed runs for it.
[2789.86 → 2792.70] I would argue Super Mario Bros. 3 is actually a harder game, though.
[2793.02 → 2793.58] But, yeah.
[2793.92 → 2794.08] Yeah.
[2794.26 → 2795.62] But I don't think it was as good.
[2796.18 → 2797.32] I didn't enjoy it as much.
[2797.42 → 2798.36] It wasn't as varied.
[2798.50 → 2799.86] It just didn't feel as...
[2799.86 → 2801.88] I mean, it probably doesn't help that we're a little bit younger.
[2802.22 → 2803.94] So you probably played Super Mario World first.
[2803.94 → 2804.24] I did.
[2804.46 → 2804.90] Yeah, me too.
[2805.60 → 2809.00] So if that were the case, then...
[2809.00 → 2813.78] There's nothing better than that very first level of Super Mario World getting the one-up by hitting the shell and all the things.
[2814.36 → 2818.20] Like, there's that one upper layer of Koo pas, and you throw the shell at them, and you get the one-up.
[2818.28 → 2823.10] Did you know there's a three-up moon in the other first level?
[2823.80 → 2824.10] Really?
[2824.28 → 2824.54] Yeah.
[2825.06 → 2827.28] Because you have to go back with the cape, and you have to get it.
[2827.50 → 2828.74] You have to fly to get it.
[2829.62 → 2830.46] I had no idea.
[2830.64 → 2830.78] Yeah.
[2830.90 → 2831.62] Anyway, sorry.
[2831.84 → 2832.34] You know what?
[2832.42 → 2833.28] We digress.
[2833.28 → 2833.32] Yes.
[2833.86 → 2835.50] So, moving right along.
[2836.00 → 2836.52] You know what?
[2836.52 → 2837.02] I'm barely even answering.
[2837.02 → 2839.40] I might as well do my three favourite games since we're at it.
[2839.46 → 2841.12] So it'd have to be Final Fantasy VI.
[2841.18 → 2841.36] Yeah.
[2841.58 → 2842.04] That's all that kind of thing.
[2842.04 → 2844.04] Which is just...
[2844.04 → 2844.24] Oh.
[2845.04 → 2845.58] Tie Fighter.
[2846.94 → 2848.86] Tie Fighter is right up there.
[2849.10 → 2851.70] That may be my second all-time favourite game.
[2852.10 → 2852.68] Did you ever...
[2852.68 → 2853.46] Have you ever played this?
[2853.60 → 2853.76] Oh.
[2854.12 → 2854.58] See, guys.
[2854.70 → 2854.86] Okay.
[2854.92 → 2856.94] I know I talk about this a lot, but Star Citizen.
[2857.22 → 2857.90] Go look at it.
[2857.90 → 2858.08] Yeah.
[2858.24 → 2859.00] Go contribute.
[2859.26 → 2859.46] Yes.
[2859.46 → 2860.50] I am...
[2860.50 → 2861.78] We should stream that the day it comes out.
[2861.96 → 2863.28] It's not going to be for a really long time.
[2863.40 → 2864.32] Well, it'll be an alpha.
[2864.48 → 2865.82] I think there's like NDAs and stuff.
[2866.04 → 2867.72] But like 2014, the game will be out.
[2867.88 → 2876.38] We will stream that because I am planning at this time to drop the $250 on the RSI Constellation
[2876.38 → 2879.00] ship, which is a multi-man ship.
[2879.72 → 2885.44] So you have a co-pilot and a gunner in this ship, and you can like cargo freight stuff
[2885.44 → 2887.40] and attack stuff and...
[2887.40 → 2889.58] Oh, I'm like so stoked.
[2890.54 → 2892.24] And then the third favourite game.
[2893.66 → 2894.18] You know what?
[2894.20 → 2895.06] I actually don't know.
[2895.74 → 2896.88] I guess it probably wouldn't hurt.
[2897.08 → 2897.34] Okay.
[2897.44 → 2897.58] No.
[2897.66 → 2897.98] Hold on.
[2898.12 → 2900.34] Like maybe something more modern that I really enjoyed.
[2900.48 → 2901.18] Probably Left 4 Dead.
[2901.28 → 2903.40] I'm surprised you haven't mentioned Halo for PC.
[2903.82 → 2904.46] Halo for PC?
[2904.60 → 2905.98] You know, I never played it that much.
[2905.98 → 2907.74] Left 4 Dead, I played a lot.
[2908.00 → 2913.72] Like I played it five, six nights a week, two, three hours a night for like a long time.
[2914.24 → 2916.70] I had liked my crew, and we were playing a lot of Left 4 Dead.
[2917.62 → 2918.56] So yeah, it was good.
[2918.70 → 2919.06] It was good.
[2919.16 → 2919.64] Good stuff.
[2920.84 → 2921.20] Okay.
[2922.22 → 2924.66] How about the topic of Hostess Company going out of business?
[2924.78 → 2925.06] You know what?
[2925.08 → 2925.72] Yeah, a number of Twinkles.
[2925.88 → 2931.10] That's not really up our alley, but I'd love to talk about Danger Den going out of business.
[2931.72 → 2934.66] So Slick actually hadn't heard about this until I mentioned it very briefly.
[2934.66 → 2940.04] I don't know if you guys know what Danger Den is, but they did water cooling, water blocks.
[2940.14 → 2943.76] They've been around since pretty much day one of PC water cooling.
[2943.92 → 2944.02] Yeah.
[2944.02 → 2948.48] Going back to the White Water, I believe was their first block.
[2948.52 → 2949.04] Oh crap.
[2949.20 → 2953.06] I hope I'm not making myself look stupid here.
[2953.22 → 2954.48] I think it was the White Water.
[2954.78 → 2955.28] I don't know.
[2955.28 → 2955.86] Little River.
[2956.04 → 2957.42] No, that was a Cathar thing.
[2957.42 → 2959.80] And Baby's crying.
[2960.80 → 2962.00] And he's crying.
[2963.52 → 2963.92] Awkward.
[2966.62 → 2968.14] So yeah, Danger Den.
[2968.22 → 2968.86] They're out of business.
[2969.36 → 2972.38] They blew everything out at like 30% of retail.
[2973.12 → 2974.64] Oh, are they still doing that?
[2974.68 → 2975.04] No.
[2975.52 → 2975.96] Thanks.
[2975.96 → 2980.48] No, the entire thing, their entire inventory was gone within a matter of hours.
[2980.64 → 2981.02] Well, yeah.
[2981.34 → 2983.04] And they're moved on to other things.
[2983.46 → 2985.36] So yeah, that's very sad.
[2985.48 → 2985.64] I mean.
[2985.74 → 2986.48] Sad, yeah.
[2986.84 → 2988.38] Water cooling is so niche though.
[2988.78 → 2989.10] I mean.
[2989.10 → 2991.86] Yeah, but to lose someone like Danger Den just sucks.
[2992.38 → 2995.46] It's been a long time since they've been a front-runner on anything though.
[2995.52 → 2996.52] It still just sucks.
[2997.02 → 2997.34] I know.
[2998.30 → 3000.96] Yeah, it was four brothers actually that ran the business.
[3001.22 → 3004.18] So it was like a family business and all that good stuff.
[3004.50 → 3005.92] So yeah, bummer about that.
[3005.92 → 3010.48] And they were the only one left that was still actually trying to manufacture anything in North America.
[3011.26 → 3013.28] Which might be part of the problem.
[3013.28 → 3013.98] Part of the reason, yeah.
[3014.22 → 3017.00] I mean, Swift Tech does all their production overseas now.
[3017.00 → 3019.34] All their blocks, everything is produced overseas.
[3019.46 → 3021.90] EK is obviously based out of Slovenia.
[3022.04 → 3024.32] Cheap Eastern European everything.
[3024.88 → 3025.82] Except currency.
[3026.38 → 3027.70] But I think they do okay.
[3029.94 → 3030.42] Yeah.
[3030.64 → 3031.84] So anyway, moving right along.
[3032.98 → 3034.66] Do you like the switches on the Black Widow Ultimate?
[3035.82 → 3039.50] They're blues, but honestly the build of the keyboard is not my favourite.
[3039.78 → 3041.20] The travel seems short.
[3041.20 → 3044.08] It doesn't feel quite right to me.
[3044.72 → 3046.12] One quick shout out to somebody.
[3046.12 → 3047.64] This guy tweets at me all the time.
[3047.72 → 3048.12] How's it going?
[3048.82 → 3052.58] First though, they're not true blues.
[3052.90 → 3053.20] They aren't?
[3053.44 → 3053.66] No.
[3053.84 → 3054.50] I didn't know that.
[3055.12 → 3056.60] Razor's done something with them.
[3056.72 → 3061.34] I remember reading, I don't own one, and I've never used one in excess.
[3061.58 → 3062.34] I've used one a little bit.
[3062.42 → 3064.34] And like you said, it feels a little bit different.
[3064.36 → 3064.88] Yeah, it doesn't feel quite the same.
[3064.90 → 3065.66] The travel feels a little bit different.
[3065.90 → 3066.08] Yeah.
[3066.08 → 3069.16] I read a huge post on OCN.
[3069.28 → 3070.16] I'm calling it OCN again.
[3071.84 → 3073.40] Huge thread on it on OCN.
[3073.46 → 3077.46] And if you check out the mechanical keyboard guide on OCN, which is awesome, scroll all the
[3077.46 → 3079.64] way down and look at different keyboards in the guide.
[3079.86 → 3081.02] Black Widow Ultimate is one of them.
[3081.02 → 3083.44] And they reference the build quality of it.
[3083.76 → 3085.02] They have their own, like...
[3085.02 → 3086.02] You look...
[3087.46 → 3088.98] I'm just joking.
[3090.74 → 3093.42] Like, the build quality is just not quite there, in my opinion.
[3093.68 → 3095.68] But it's still a nice keyboard.
[3097.30 → 3099.10] But the keys, they're slightly different.
[3099.22 → 3102.10] They're not really the standard blues you look for.
[3102.10 → 3105.10] Can be just...
[3105.10 → 3109.96] Oh, Robert.
[3110.94 → 3112.00] You rascal.
[3114.82 → 3117.96] Is there any particular reason that Slick PC has been unveiled?
[3121.06 → 3121.50] No.
[3122.10 → 3123.04] No, not really.
[3125.14 → 3126.52] What's a good power line adapter?
[3126.66 → 3127.58] Trend Net has a good one.
[3128.34 → 3131.32] They're 400 megabit or whatever.
[3131.32 → 3133.30] The 405e something.
[3133.46 → 3133.68] Whatever.
[3133.76 → 3134.30] They're all good.
[3137.98 → 3138.42] Okay.
[3138.84 → 3140.22] Just installed something.
[3141.90 → 3143.30] This is an interesting question.
[3143.44 → 3145.24] I don't hate anything about AS Rock.
[3146.50 → 3149.00] And, I mean, asking someone a question like,
[3149.22 → 3152.20] why don't you like the products of Company X if you have owned one,
[3152.46 → 3154.98] is sort of pretty self-explanatory.
[3155.70 → 3157.14] So why don't we just leave it at that?
[3157.16 → 3159.18] Also, companies, even if you don't...
[3159.18 → 3161.48] Even if you claim to not necessarily like that company,
[3161.78 → 3164.80] they can still come up with a couple of things that are perfect.
[3165.00 → 3165.70] Yeah, absolutely.
[3166.12 → 3169.16] You can't judge a company on a couple different items.
[3169.60 → 3171.78] Most people have at least something that's keeping them alive.
[3172.62 → 3173.60] Alan, good question.
[3173.60 → 3179.22] I wouldn't recommend the Half LB for a home server because of the lack of 3.5-inch drive cages.
[3179.32 → 3180.12] It's only got two.
[3181.22 → 3184.04] Not really something that I'd consider to be that interesting.
[3184.38 → 3184.82] You know what?
[3184.96 → 3188.40] This is actually kind of a funny conversation topic.
[3188.62 → 3190.40] You just jumped over at the last guy that asked.
[3190.40 → 3193.40] I know, but I changed...
[3193.40 → 3196.10] No, because he specifically mentioned Twinkles.
[3196.22 → 3196.44] Okay.
[3196.54 → 3197.66] I have never eaten a Twinkle.
[3197.76 → 3198.90] I've also never eaten a Twinkle.
[3199.00 → 3200.34] Maybe this is why they're going out of business.
[3203.50 → 3208.60] It's funny because I really like the old 80s comic Bloom County.
[3209.36 → 3210.08] I don't know if you have...
[3210.08 → 3210.56] Okay, forget it.
[3210.56 → 3211.44] I've read a lot of comics.
[3211.54 → 3212.40] Not comic books.
[3212.74 → 3213.82] I'm a comic guy.
[3214.08 → 3214.22] Right.
[3214.22 → 3214.66] Which is different.
[3214.76 → 3215.66] So like newspaper comics?
[3215.66 → 3221.28] Yeah, like Foxtrot, Peanuts, that, you know, for better or for worse, those kinds of comics.
[3223.02 → 3227.86] And they talk a lot about Twinkles because there's like a cockroach character.
[3228.24 → 3230.14] And so you know the whole thing.
[3230.20 → 3232.04] The only thing that survives a nuclear holocaust is...
[3232.04 → 3232.96] It's Twinkles and cockroaches.
[3233.00 → 3233.76] Twinkles and cockroaches.
[3233.76 → 3235.80] And ironically, Twinkles...
[3235.80 → 3236.60] Have not survived.
[3236.64 → 3239.80] Have not survived any kind of nuclear holocaust.
[3241.68 → 3242.56] So, yeah.
[3242.72 → 3243.34] I just, yeah.
[3243.62 → 3245.26] So it's just one of those weird factoids.
[3245.26 → 3247.06] It's like my mom has never eaten a Big Mac.
[3247.98 → 3250.76] And it's just like, how do you go through life without having eaten a Big Mac?
[3251.66 → 3253.16] You know what kind of kills me?
[3253.22 → 3254.50] Is Wagon Wheels hostess?
[3256.12 → 3257.54] A lot of stuff is hostess.
[3257.66 → 3259.34] Let's find out who made Wagon Wheels.
[3260.06 → 3261.56] Wagon Wheel Manu fact...
[3261.56 → 3264.20] We're going to end up with all kinds of stupid crap in this search.
[3264.70 → 3266.24] Hanson Wheel and Wagon Shop.
[3267.84 → 3270.10] Wagon Wheel Manufacturers on Alibaba.
[3270.70 → 3270.94] Okay.
[3271.16 → 3271.70] Like Treats or something.
[3271.70 → 3274.56] Yeah, Wagon Wheel Treat Manufacturer, Wikipedia.
[3275.26 → 3276.58] Wagon Wheels are...
[3276.58 → 3277.62] Oh, interesting.
[3277.98 → 3280.20] These aren't available in a lot of different places.
[3280.98 → 3282.00] Yeah, there's a Wagon Wheel.
[3283.16 → 3288.82] So, we're created by something Weston, something, production and size, blah, blah, blah.
[3288.82 → 3292.52] Uh, the Australian equivalent.
[3293.42 → 3294.00] Burton's Foods.
[3294.08 → 3295.24] Okay, apparently not related.
[3295.62 → 3297.86] But did you ever have a Wagon Wheel when you were a kid?
[3298.30 → 3298.50] Yeah.
[3299.24 → 3301.58] Weren't they just a hundred times more delicious than they are now?
[3301.58 → 3302.48] They are now, yeah.
[3302.68 → 3304.00] They taste like crap now.
[3304.02 → 3304.52] Yeah, they do.
[3304.86 → 3306.38] They just taste like cardboard.
[3306.66 → 3306.84] Yeah.
[3306.84 → 3309.76] With, like, it's not even, I don't think it's even real marshmallow anymore.
[3310.32 → 3313.72] Which is horrible because marshmallows are the cheapest thing on the face of the earth.
[3313.78 → 3315.08] How do you cheap out on marshmallows?
[3315.26 → 3316.04] Don't find a way.
[3316.28 → 3320.36] I think that comes into, like, everything seems to be ever so slightly lower build quality.
[3321.60 → 3322.40] Halloween candy.
[3322.64 → 3323.50] But lower build quality.
[3323.62 → 3326.72] Halloween candy this year was smaller than I've ever seen it.
[3327.24 → 3330.88] Kit Kats, like the Halloween Kit Kats used to be about this big.
[3330.88 → 3333.28] And they were four sticks.
[3334.00 → 3336.26] This year, they were, like, this big.
[3336.78 → 3337.50] Like, this long.
[3338.00 → 3339.32] And they're, like, two sticks.
[3339.54 → 3341.30] I don't actually ever remember them being four sticks.
[3341.32 → 3341.98] Two small sticks.
[3342.16 → 3345.08] Oh, when I was a little kid, they were four sticks.
[3346.02 → 3347.40] It's like, okay.
[3348.10 → 3348.48] Alright.
[3348.90 → 3349.70] Yeah, I guess.
[3350.20 → 3351.32] They're so small.
[3351.64 → 3353.40] The arrows are tiny.
[3353.66 → 3354.94] Arrows were, like, multi-segment.
[3355.18 → 3356.96] Now they're just two segments, and they're, like, this big.
[3357.00 → 3357.62] Yeah, yeah.
[3357.62 → 3359.00] And the coffee crisps.
[3359.00 → 3363.02] The coffee crisps used to be short, but they used to be the right dimension for a coffee.
[3363.08 → 3363.76] Or, like, close.
[3363.92 → 3364.14] Right.
[3364.26 → 3365.84] Now they're, like, these tiny little things.
[3368.38 → 3371.34] We're having a really hard time staying on topic tonight.
[3372.98 → 3374.08] I blame you.
[3376.16 → 3378.90] I stayed on topic before you joined the live streams.
[3380.44 → 3381.32] Ah, yes.
[3381.44 → 3382.00] Good question.
[3382.50 → 3382.74] Okay.
[3382.88 → 3384.12] I'll let Slick field this one.
[3385.36 → 3386.60] Yeah, they're going to be awesome.
[3386.60 → 3388.86] I was excited about the new...
[3388.86 → 3389.34] I was over there.
[3389.36 → 3390.22] I was excited for Surface.
[3390.58 → 3394.02] And then it came out, and I was excited for, like, 12 to 24 hours.
[3394.18 → 3395.44] And then I was like, I want Pro.
[3396.22 → 3396.56] Yeah.
[3396.70 → 3397.80] No longer super excited.
[3397.92 → 3398.42] Just want Pro.
[3398.54 → 3400.04] Surface is amazing and awesome.
[3400.20 → 3400.42] RT.
[3400.62 → 3401.16] Surface RT.
[3401.22 → 3401.70] Surface RT.
[3401.98 → 3402.18] Sorry.
[3402.34 → 3403.48] It's amazing and awesome.
[3403.60 → 3408.72] But you can just feel that there's something, like, waiting to actually show up.
[3408.80 → 3409.86] Like, it could be awesome.
[3410.00 → 3412.54] It could just be even more awesome.
[3412.54 → 3414.24] Yeah, I'm pretty stoked on Pro.
[3414.24 → 3417.54] I mean, we played around with that Samsung Windows 8 tablet.
[3417.54 → 3417.72] Yeah.
[3417.72 → 3418.66] Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[3418.82 → 3419.88] It's pretty thick.
[3420.34 → 3421.22] And it's pretty heavy.
[3422.38 → 3422.82] Yep.
[3422.90 → 3424.00] But it was pretty powerful.
[3425.02 → 3426.02] And it's pretty...
[3426.02 → 3428.12] And it's awesome being able to have full desktop apps.
[3428.50 → 3428.88] Yeah.
[3429.58 → 3430.18] I mean, you could...
[3430.18 → 3430.84] I mean, think about it.
[3430.84 → 3431.88] You could run anything on it.
[3432.42 → 3432.72] Yeah.
[3433.32 → 3434.40] I guess that's sort of the point.
[3434.62 → 3434.82] Yeah.
[3436.66 → 3437.02] Good job.
[3437.34 → 3437.78] Thank you.
[3439.88 → 3440.90] Yeah, moving on.
[3440.90 → 3442.62] I'm gonna hide now.
[3444.56 → 3445.84] Let's keep going here.
[3445.90 → 3446.96] Let's see if there's anything that interesting.
[3447.38 → 3448.48] Just got fibre optic.
[3448.62 → 3449.34] Wow, you suck.
[3450.64 → 3454.14] Actually, Kevin, Kevin, I envy you.
[3454.24 → 3454.84] You don't suck.
[3454.92 → 3455.68] I just envy you.
[3456.52 → 3457.00] That's...
[3457.00 → 3461.34] It's an honour to have my name on the show.
[3461.40 → 3462.44] I don't think that's the right person.
[3462.44 → 3463.50] But it said that...
[3463.50 → 3465.68] His actual Twitter name was Dan the Man.
[3466.14 → 3470.76] Was dreaming of Slick PC, so played him a song called Boyfriend.
[3470.90 → 3471.32] Hmm.
[3473.96 → 3474.40] Okay.
[3475.42 → 3476.84] Building of something, something.
[3477.08 → 3478.38] Nexus 10, an iPad 3.
[3478.42 → 3478.68] You know what?
[3478.70 → 3480.46] I don't have a Nexus 10, unfortunately.
[3481.54 → 3484.02] Did you hear about the Queen using a Galaxy 10.1?
[3484.14 → 3484.90] No, I did not.
[3486.36 → 3488.58] Have any plans for doing a custom case build?
[3488.72 → 3489.16] No.
[3489.78 → 3492.72] Other than just cutting holes in my own, that's all I'm really planning.
[3492.86 → 3496.36] And then Slick's already done his oil machine, which is about as custom as it gets.
[3497.24 → 3497.56] Okay.
[3497.90 → 3500.66] Here is a helpful tip for everyone.
[3502.74 → 3505.06] Thanks for that, InkBot2000.
[3505.86 → 3506.20] All right.
[3506.38 → 3507.02] Let's go back up.
[3507.12 → 3510.38] What do you say we grab another topic off the old phone there?
[3510.62 → 3512.38] I think the main ones left are gaming topics.
[3512.60 → 3513.18] Gaming topics?
[3513.30 → 3518.14] Well, gaming topics are fine, because technically we're on Twitch TV, as people are so eager to point out to me,
[3518.36 → 3522.10] why are you doing a talk show on Twitch TV if you're not streaming games?
[3522.78 → 3527.28] Other than my two gaming topics, we've got the inconvenience of Garage Studio.
[3527.28 → 3529.38] Oh, I heard Black Ops 2 isn't good.
[3530.64 → 3530.84] What?
[3531.90 → 3532.80] Just in general.
[3533.72 → 3534.20] The new one.
[3535.62 → 3538.84] I heard that there were Mass Effect 2 discs in the box.
[3539.46 → 3539.88] Yes.
[3540.38 → 3540.86] Yes.
[3541.60 → 3542.80] That's actually hilarious.
[3542.90 → 3545.00] I heard they got the wrong game.
[3545.16 → 3546.88] That wasn't actually just Mass Effect.
[3547.18 → 3551.64] That was, I think that was at least one other game had that problem, within the same time frame.
[3552.12 → 3556.02] I don't remember who it was, but I saw it online and there was a ton of them.
[3556.02 → 3557.20] Just the wrong disc.
[3557.28 → 3559.94] No, I heard it was something like a million copies or something like that.
[3560.08 → 3560.62] Like, huge.
[3561.04 → 3566.78] And BioWare, in response, gave out, I don't remember how many people it was.
[3566.96 → 3569.66] They should have just been like, we're sorry you bought Black Ops 2.
[3569.76 → 3571.30] Here's a more enjoyable game instead.
[3571.74 → 3573.10] Yeah, they let them keep it.
[3573.28 → 3575.56] They let them keep it, and then they got another Black Ops.
[3575.62 → 3576.80] So they got free Mass Effect 2.
[3577.28 → 3582.20] Also, an X amount of people, I don't remember who it was, that sent them, I think it was an email,
[3582.20 → 3584.82] of a picture of them holding their disc 2 from Black Ops,
[3584.82 → 3590.24] and the error screen showing that it was Mass Effect, got the entire suite of Mass Effect games in all DLC.
[3590.96 → 3591.36] Wow.
[3591.54 → 3591.70] Yeah.
[3592.24 → 3593.92] Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3 in all DLC.
[3594.00 → 3598.88] I guess it's good publicity for BioWare and Mass Effect, because everyone's talking about it.
[3598.96 → 3599.52] Yep, yep.
[3599.52 → 3602.40] In other news, I heard Halo 4 is awesome.
[3603.30 → 3606.62] Yeah, actually, I was a huge fan of Halo 1.
[3607.00 → 3608.46] I was a massive fan of Halo 2.
[3608.52 → 3609.22] I played it forever.
[3610.04 → 3614.66] And then Halo 3 came out, and just all the disappointment, all of it.
[3614.74 → 3616.14] I was so not happy with that game.
[3616.48 → 3620.94] And then Reach came out, and I was like, I'll try it at a friend's house, because I was so disappointed with 3.
[3621.38 → 3622.76] Again, all the disappointment.
[3623.00 → 3624.04] Was not excited for it.
[3624.04 → 3626.30] And Halo 4, again, tried it as a friend's.
[3626.30 → 3627.06] It was pretty fun.
[3627.74 → 3628.18] It was cool.
[3628.30 → 3631.82] I had someone trying to tell me that the pregame cinematic are rendered in real time.
[3633.18 → 3634.06] Did you see them?
[3635.02 → 3635.34] No.
[3635.46 → 3636.30] They're crazy.
[3636.58 → 3637.62] They're like crazy.
[3637.80 → 3640.04] Like, GTX 680 might be able to handle it.
[3640.32 → 3640.60] Wow.
[3640.82 → 3641.04] Yeah.
[3641.32 → 3642.96] And I was like, yeah, no, no, it isn't.
[3644.62 → 3645.30] Like, yeah, that's...
[3645.30 → 3645.36] No.
[3646.02 → 3647.14] Good for you, but no.
[3647.38 → 3648.06] No, just no.
[3649.12 → 3649.90] Yeah, no, it's fun.
[3650.08 → 3650.44] It's really fun.
[3650.46 → 3651.38] Okay, what was our other topic?
[3651.66 → 3652.20] Do you have it?
[3652.20 → 3652.76] I thought we were going to do it.
[3652.82 → 3653.58] Do I have Halo 4?
[3653.78 → 3654.66] I thought we were going to do it once.
[3654.66 → 3657.24] No, we were going to do an unboxing at Halo 4.
[3657.32 → 3659.30] I unboxed it on my live stream before you joined me.
[3659.32 → 3659.48] Okay.
[3659.68 → 3661.84] And then I licked the disc and I gave it to my co-worker.
[3662.52 → 3663.94] I don't think he ever found out.
[3664.12 → 3664.82] It was awesome.
[3665.94 → 3668.88] Okay, so other than that, I've got YouTube money slash effort.
[3669.34 → 3670.60] No, we shouldn't cover that.
[3670.68 → 3672.40] Okay, so Tomb Raider revamp.
[3672.52 → 3673.26] Have you heard about that at all?
[3673.38 → 3673.70] Really?
[3674.26 → 3675.34] No, it actually looks perfect.
[3676.70 → 3677.92] Tomb Raiders, okay, Tomb Raiders.
[3678.08 → 3679.32] Yeah, Lara Croft looks perfect.
[3679.38 → 3680.10] That doesn't make a Tomb Raider even good.
[3680.10 → 3682.22] Exactly, but they're trying to get away from that.
[3683.02 → 3685.24] Their whole thing with the new Tomb Raider is trying to get away from that.
[3685.34 → 3688.68] She's still obviously attractive because she's a female main character, but they're taking
[3688.68 → 3691.90] a lot from Drake's Fortune, and they're supposed to be taking a lot from Assassin's Creed.
[3692.10 → 3692.68] Yeah, but Drake's...
[3692.68 → 3695.00] And they're completely rebooting the whole series.
[3695.00 → 3700.18] Didn't they just reboot the whole series not that long ago and remake the first game or
[3700.18 → 3700.40] whatever?
[3701.12 → 3702.66] It's not a remake of the first game though.
[3702.68 → 3703.54] It's a full reboot.
[3703.68 → 3705.08] They're not just like remaking stuff.
[3705.32 → 3707.50] They're actually changing the whole storyline.
[3708.18 → 3711.82] She's still obviously a Tomb Raider, but like she starts off as...
[3711.82 → 3714.32] I don't remember exactly what it is, but it's fairly innocent.
[3715.08 → 3716.32] And then there's...
[3716.32 → 3719.20] It's much more storyline based instead of just like, oh, I have big boobs.
[3719.42 → 3722.04] Did you hear about how she had big boobs and how that actually happened?
[3722.18 → 3722.46] No.
[3722.46 → 3727.18] The main artist was like working on the model for Laura Croft.
[3727.70 → 3731.18] Investor meeting comes in, and they come to go look at the model for Laura Croft and he
[3731.18 → 3735.44] mixed up the shape for her boobs with a traffic cone.
[3736.54 → 3740.16] And when they saw it, he's like, oh no, no, this is like the general idea of her, but her
[3740.16 → 3740.98] boobs are just kind of messed up.
[3741.04 → 3742.16] I screwed that up with the traffic cone.
[3742.32 → 3743.20] I'll fix it right now.
[3743.38 → 3743.94] He fixed it.
[3744.02 → 3745.08] They said, no, put it back.
[3746.00 → 3749.36] They moved it back to a traffic cone, released the game, and it did really well.
[3749.36 → 3752.60] You know what was the cruelest internet rumour ever?
[3753.08 → 3756.12] That there was a nude raider hack for a Tomb Raider.
[3757.12 → 3763.96] Because I swear, like me and a friend when we were in like grade seven or something, spent
[3763.96 → 3769.92] like unimaginable amounts of time trying to find it because people claimed it was real,
[3769.92 → 3772.12] but that was, it was all a ruse.
[3772.74 → 3773.56] It was not real.
[3775.38 → 3777.18] I mean, you know, 12-year-olds.
[3777.18 → 3777.94] But no, seriously.
[3779.00 → 3782.60] I watched the video for Tomb Raider, and it actually looks perfect now.
[3782.72 → 3784.34] And I've never been interested in that series.
[3784.52 → 3785.56] Would you buy it at launch?
[3786.70 → 3788.06] I don't buy many things at launch.
[3788.80 → 3789.14] Okay.
[3789.92 → 3793.74] You bought Halo 2 at launch because you were excited about it.
[3793.74 → 3795.26] You bought Halo 3 at launch probably, right?
[3795.34 → 3795.56] Yeah.
[3795.56 → 3795.68] Yeah.
[3796.00 → 3796.28] Okay.
[3796.60 → 3797.16] But I learned more about it.
[3797.16 → 3799.64] Do you have any faith in the Tomb Raider franchise?
[3799.94 → 3801.86] I actually do have some faith in the Tomb Raider franchise.
[3802.34 → 3806.32] See, you know, the last time I bought a game at launch, actually I bought two games around
[3806.32 → 3806.96] the same time.
[3807.18 → 3809.12] I bought Bios hock 2 as a pre-order.
[3811.72 → 3814.88] I pre-ordered, oh, I didn't even take that in fully.
[3815.22 → 3815.74] I'm sorry.
[3816.54 → 3817.42] That's depressing.
[3817.42 → 3820.70] No, the good news was I had never played Bios hock and I didn't have it.
[3820.88 → 3823.34] And the Bios hock 2 pre-order came with Bios hock.
[3823.34 → 3823.70] Okay.
[3823.82 → 3825.80] So I played Bios hock all the way through.
[3826.10 → 3828.48] Mind you, it was like a $15 title by that time.
[3828.58 → 3828.76] Yeah.
[3828.88 → 3829.04] Yeah.
[3829.22 → 3831.76] But I did get some value for it.
[3832.28 → 3835.52] They're calling Infinite the true sequel to Bios hock 1.
[3835.70 → 3836.02] Okay.
[3836.68 → 3838.74] I don't think Bios hock 1 needed a sequel.
[3839.40 → 3839.82] No, I know.
[3839.88 → 3844.14] But it's not supposed to be, as far as I've seen, it's a completely different storyline.
[3844.62 → 3846.58] It's just similar gameplay and similar idea.
[3847.50 → 3847.82] Okay.
[3847.98 → 3848.86] Well, okay.
[3848.86 → 3850.26] It also looks pretty okay.
[3850.58 → 3853.94] The other game that I pre-ordered at the same time was Left 4 Dead 2.
[3854.44 → 3854.68] Oh.
[3855.80 → 3859.38] Left 4 Dead, you know, I put so many hundreds of hours into Left 4 Dead 1.
[3859.60 → 3861.28] Left 4 Dead 2 should have been a DLC for $10.
[3861.76 → 3861.92] Yeah.
[3861.92 → 3862.60] $15, maybe.
[3862.82 → 3867.14] It's just, what was it, four new maps and different characters that honestly I hated.
[3867.64 → 3868.94] Like I didn't like any of them.
[3869.16 → 3871.82] But they didn't try and hide that though.
[3872.62 → 3873.80] They called it 2.
[3874.36 → 3874.72] Right.
[3874.72 → 3875.44] That's bad enough.
[3875.46 → 3878.10] But if you do like any minor amount of research on the game.
[3879.72 → 3880.04] Okay.
[3880.38 → 3880.80] Yes.
[3880.92 → 3886.26] But it was not clear before release the extent to which it was just a copy-paste of Left 4
[3886.26 → 3886.60] Dead 1.
[3887.26 → 3887.80] With like what?
[3887.88 → 3889.76] I think it was like with the spinner.
[3889.76 → 3890.42] Two new monsters.
[3890.42 → 3891.82] Two new monsters or something.
[3892.48 → 3893.22] And it was...
[3893.22 → 3894.66] I was not...
[3894.66 → 3895.60] Are you getting melee weapons?
[3897.16 → 3897.86] If you care.
[3897.96 → 3898.30] I don't know.
[3898.62 → 3899.72] I don't think it mattered.
[3899.92 → 3901.82] Like I don't think it affected gameplay that much.
[3901.82 → 3902.56] I liked...
[3902.56 → 3904.02] I didn't really play Left 4 Dead 2.
[3904.28 → 3905.82] So I don't really have a lot of input.
[3905.98 → 3906.98] I played Left 4 Dead 1 though.
[3907.34 → 3909.10] Left 4 Dead 1 was phenomenally well-balanced.
[3909.38 → 3910.28] I mean that's everything.
[3910.42 → 3912.10] It's like Team Fortress 2.
[3912.32 → 3913.44] I mean what's great about it?
[3913.56 → 3914.40] It's not innovative.
[3914.94 → 3917.50] Team Fortress has existed for years before Team Fortress 2.
[3917.68 → 3918.88] Hats didn't change a lot.
[3919.46 → 3920.54] The graphics are way better.
[3920.64 → 3921.76] The gameplay did change a bit.
[3921.90 → 3923.28] Graphics being better is an innovation.
[3923.58 → 3925.28] But the graphics completely changed.
[3925.38 → 3926.44] And they scrapped the whole...
[3926.44 → 3927.80] They were almost done Team Fortress 2.
[3927.88 → 3930.08] And then scrapped the entire project because they didn't like the style.
[3930.42 → 3931.12] And remade it.
[3931.12 → 3932.68] Because it was too serious.
[3933.00 → 3933.46] Either way.
[3933.60 → 3934.62] The balance is everything.
[3935.54 → 3936.40] And I didn't...
[3936.40 → 3936.74] Yeah.
[3936.86 → 3938.04] I just didn't like Left 4 Dead 2.
[3938.96 → 3939.34] Alright.
[3939.44 → 3941.40] Let's have a look at some new interactions here.
[3941.64 → 3941.88] Oh.
[3941.98 → 3943.16] We're not getting into that, Jacob.
[3945.62 → 3946.90] Joe wants to know...
[3946.90 → 3948.10] How tall are you?
[3948.56 → 3949.60] I slouch a lot.
[3949.68 → 3950.58] But I'm 6'3".
[3950.58 → 3951.86] Are you really 6'3"?
[3951.86 → 3954.46] So he's like 9 inches taller than me.
[3954.84 → 3955.48] But that's okay.
[3955.54 → 3956.42] Because I got it where it counts.
[3958.20 → 3958.60] Yeah.
[3958.68 → 3959.72] Laugh all you want.
[3959.72 → 3961.68] One of these days...
[3961.68 → 3963.00] We'll compare in the live stream.
[3963.18 → 3963.62] For $12.
[3964.00 → 3964.18] Yeah.
[3964.22 → 3964.64] For $12.
[3965.56 → 3965.92] Wait.
[3966.02 → 3966.86] What's this about $12?
[3966.96 → 3967.08] Oh.
[3967.28 → 3968.82] Bios hock 2 was awesome for $12.
[3969.94 → 3971.70] Bios hock 2 was unplayable.
[3972.14 → 3973.32] It was totally unplayable.
[3973.42 → 3974.98] I made it through about 15 minutes.
[3975.50 → 3976.28] I was just like...
[3976.28 → 3977.66] This is terrible.
[3977.66 → 3979.50] I'm playing through Bios hock 1 right now.
[3980.14 → 3982.92] I have no interest in playing Bios hock 2 from what I've heard.
[3982.96 → 3984.48] I have time to play through Bios hock 1.
[3984.56 → 3986.50] You haven't edited any episodes in weeks.
[3986.50 → 3989.08] I've been playing through Bios hock 1 for the last like 6 months.
[3989.22 → 3989.54] Okay.
[3990.28 → 3990.64] Yeah.
[3990.70 → 3991.14] Fair enough.
[3993.22 → 3994.28] Nude Raider was real.
[3994.44 → 3994.80] He claims...
[3994.80 → 3994.92] No.
[3995.00 → 3995.60] You know what Adam?
[3995.64 → 3997.04] I'm not falling for it this time.
[3997.16 → 3997.94] Maybe you just failed.
[3998.12 → 3998.70] Maybe it is real.
[3998.80 → 3999.94] Maybe you can just...
[3999.94 → 4000.18] Okay.
[4000.30 → 4002.00] Even if it was real, would it matter?
[4002.60 → 4004.26] I mean the pixels were like this big.
[4004.58 → 4005.48] You cared at the time.
[4005.48 → 4006.06] Yes, I cared.
[4006.08 → 4006.60] I was 12.
[4010.44 → 4011.24] I was 12.
[4011.24 → 4016.66] And like having a video card at that time that could output like 16-bit colour was a big deal.
[4017.10 → 4018.56] So, you know.
[4020.18 → 4022.14] 660 Ti or 7950 with the new drivers.
[4022.22 → 4022.62] You know what?
[4022.82 → 4025.18] We're hoping to check this out not that long from now.
[4026.52 → 4028.44] Because honestly right now we don't know.
[4028.52 → 4031.68] Because they both got new drivers that increased performance dramatically.
[4032.10 → 4033.00] So, yeah.
[4034.06 → 4035.12] Jake, good question.
[4035.12 → 4040.08] Why is everyone so excited about Windows 8 tablets when there were Windows 7 tablets out years ago?
[4040.28 → 4042.90] Because Windows 7 is terrible for touch.
[4044.18 → 4045.74] And they were huge.
[4046.02 → 4046.90] Yeah, they were huge.
[4047.44 → 4048.16] And terrible.
[4048.86 → 4049.12] I mean...
[4049.68 → 4050.56] And like...
[4050.56 → 4051.94] It comes down to the devices.
[4052.12 → 4053.64] Like why is Windows 8 touch so good?
[4053.70 → 4056.24] Because you have devices like Surface that are freaking awesome.
[4056.76 → 4060.08] And like have accurate touch screens and multitouch and fast interfaces.
[4060.26 → 4062.08] Windows 7 is unusable.
[4062.08 → 4063.08] They didn't have...
[4063.08 → 4065.04] There wasn't a huge budget in making tablets.
[4065.20 → 4065.30] No.
[4065.30 → 4067.48] There wasn't hordes of people going out and buying tablets.
[4067.60 → 4070.00] So why would a company poor enough money to make something awesome?
[4070.22 → 4070.58] That's right.
[4070.66 → 4072.86] And the problem is like a Windows 7 tablet...
[4073.58 → 4074.38] You couldn't even take...
[4074.38 → 4074.54] Okay.
[4074.62 → 4076.10] Windows 8 tablet you take for granted.
[4076.28 → 4077.64] It's capacitive multitouch.
[4077.64 → 4079.24] Windows 7 tablets?
[4079.38 → 4079.64] I mean...
[4080.36 → 4080.86] Like...
[4080.86 → 4082.56] You might have multitouch.
[4082.98 → 4084.64] Or you might have single-point touch.
[4084.76 → 4085.90] And it might not be accurate.
[4086.50 → 4087.18] At all.
[4087.64 → 4091.46] It was more like a niche thing for like contractors who must have a tablet.
[4091.46 → 4092.46] So...
[4092.46 → 4094.46] Um...
[4094.46 → 4096.02] Lou asks...
[4096.02 → 4097.42] Why do I not live stream to YouTube?
[4097.64 → 4098.60] I am a YouTube partner.
[4098.74 → 4099.82] I am a YouTube partner.
[4100.18 → 4102.24] I don't live stream to YouTube because it's terrible.
[4102.78 → 4103.96] And the quality is terrible.
[4103.96 → 4107.36] So I might as well stream here and then upload it to YouTube after.
[4108.20 → 4109.88] I haven't painted my case again yet.
[4109.90 → 4111.40] But it's going to cost me a couple of hundred bucks.
[4113.04 → 4115.58] Opinion on HIS Ice-Q AMD cards?
[4115.80 → 4116.20] Well...
[4116.20 → 4116.98] They're made by HIS.
[4117.18 → 4119.26] And they have Ice-Q coolers on them which are quiet.
[4120.24 → 4121.08] And they're AMD cards.
[4121.30 → 4121.62] I mean...
[4121.62 → 4122.88] There's not a lot to say these days.
[4122.96 → 4126.12] The board partners aren't able to differentiate in that many ways.
[4127.92 → 4129.06] Hi FBI and Lao.
[4129.30 → 4129.80] Thank you.
[4130.28 → 4131.98] I'm glad to hear I have fans in Asia too.
[4133.96 → 4137.30] Why didn't you and Slick play Black Ops?
[4137.72 → 4141.86] Don't you use trackers like all the people I can give you a file list invite?
[4143.04 → 4144.04] I don't understand.
[4145.92 → 4146.68] Do you understand?
[4149.12 → 4151.26] Oh, is he asking why we don't torrent it or something?
[4151.40 → 4151.88] I think so.
[4152.00 → 4153.34] Oh, well because we buy games?
[4154.62 → 4155.70] I have Black Ops too.
[4155.94 → 4156.94] Do you have Black Ops too?
[4157.44 → 4158.84] Why do you have Black Ops too?
[4158.94 → 4160.04] Harrison bought it for me from a birthday.
[4160.04 → 4160.44] Oh.
[4161.34 → 4161.64] Right.
[4161.74 → 4163.26] And you were like...
[4163.26 → 4163.80] Bang.
[4163.80 → 4165.32] My hand doesn't work.
[4166.04 → 4166.80] Oh yeah, that too.
[4168.00 → 4169.48] He has a mapping injury.
[4170.22 → 4170.66] No.
[4172.32 → 4175.14] Watch the last live stream if you want to know what happened there.
[4175.66 → 4177.12] Yeah, you can watch him injure it.
[4177.12 → 4183.26] Yeah, see?
[4183.60 → 4186.12] Oil-cooled computers are a bad idea.
[4186.28 → 4187.10] What have you washed?
[4187.22 → 4187.78] How far have I been?
[4188.12 → 4190.90] How did you wash your motherboard when you took apart the oil-cooled machine?
[4191.32 → 4191.80] I didn't bother.
[4191.90 → 4192.42] I just dripped right it.
[4192.82 → 4194.34] I didn't need it right away, so I was like, book.
[4194.72 → 4195.54] And how long does it take?
[4196.12 → 4197.62] I left it for a while.
[4197.92 → 4198.44] Oh, okay.
[4199.22 → 4199.86] Like a week?
[4200.48 → 4201.14] Somewhere around there.
[4201.26 → 4201.50] Okay.
[4201.50 → 4202.56] It was ready pretty good.
[4202.58 → 4203.98] Like, I could have used it right away.
[4204.08 → 4205.32] It would have just dripped more.
[4205.46 → 4207.12] Because oil doesn't come off stuff very quickly.
[4208.38 → 4213.40] Will a 200-watt power supply be enough for a custom NAS box, i.e. small form factor with
[4213.40 → 4214.44] four or six hard drives?
[4214.82 → 4215.90] I'll let you field that one.
[4215.94 → 4216.66] I'm going to run to the washer.
[4217.62 → 4217.98] Yes?
[4219.02 → 4219.34] Okay.
[4219.50 → 4221.18] You might have to find more questions to answer that.
[4223.18 → 4223.74] One sec.
[4225.28 → 4226.86] Maybe do another discussion topic.
[4227.96 → 4229.00] Another discussion topic?
[4229.00 → 4229.94] Oh, okay.
[4231.24 → 4232.42] Give me one moment, guys.
[4233.78 → 4235.00] I think I've got one more on here.
[4235.12 → 4235.36] Okay.
[4235.62 → 4237.02] Massive League of Legends changes.
[4237.16 → 4239.58] He probably wouldn't care about this anyway, so I'll jump into it right now.
[4239.92 → 4244.00] I don't know how many viewers are into League of Legends, but considering it's a massive freaking
[4244.00 → 4245.20] game, I'm sure tons of you are.
[4245.74 → 4249.74] If you guys haven't checked this out yet, go to surrenderat20.net, I believe it is, or
[4249.74 → 4250.94] just Google Surrenderat20.
[4251.64 → 4252.38] You'll find it.
[4252.38 → 4257.50] They have the posts for tons of new items, tons of item changes.
[4257.50 → 4262.24] Like revamped items, new items, new item tiers.
[4262.66 → 4264.06] Boots are getting huge changes.
[4264.68 → 4270.62] They're taking 25 speed across the board off all the boots and adding it to champions.
[4271.32 → 4276.44] There's now tier three boots, but what the tier three boots are is they're actually enchantments
[4276.44 → 4277.14] that you put on your boot.
[4277.28 → 4281.38] So it's not like you buy another tier that only is a linear tier.
[4281.38 → 4285.12] There's, I think, five different types of enchantments that you can place however you
[4285.12 → 4286.12] want on any of the boots.
[4287.14 → 4288.36] I'm trying to remember some of them.
[4288.88 → 4290.52] Alacrity increases your movement speed.
[4291.76 → 4292.78] There's another one.
[4292.82 → 4294.96] I don't remember the names of all these, but one of them increases your movement speed
[4294.96 → 4295.52] while in combat.
[4295.72 → 4298.92] One of them increases your teammates' movement speeds while they're moving towards you.
[4298.98 → 4299.96] I think that one's called Captain.
[4300.46 → 4301.52] There are a bunch of other ones.
[4301.52 → 4303.52] There's some minor map changes.
[4304.96 → 4307.10] Huge, huge patch coming fairly soon.
[4307.16 → 4309.52] I think it's on the test realm right now.
[4309.66 → 4309.96] So, yeah.
[4310.88 → 4311.78] Sounds fascinating.
[4315.18 → 4318.82] If Steam makes their own OS, would it be as popular as Linux?
[4319.50 → 4322.42] I think it would be much less popular than Linux.
[4323.88 → 4328.02] Unless there's like a dedicated device that they're going to sell on the cheap that like
[4328.02 → 4328.78] runs it or something.
[4328.78 → 4331.72] Yeah, but if Steam makes their own OS, it's probably going to be Linux.
[4331.84 → 4333.22] Well, that and Steam wouldn't make an OS.
[4333.34 → 4334.32] Valve would make an OS.
[4334.78 → 4335.48] Well, yeah.
[4335.72 → 4337.50] But if they, whatever.
[4338.84 → 4339.30] Just saying.
[4339.32 → 4341.30] If they did, well, I was just going off of what he said.
[4341.52 → 4344.38] Anyway, if they did, it would probably be Linux anyway.
[4344.56 → 4346.36] It would just probably be their own adaptation of Linux.
[4348.06 → 4349.36] Brendan says, hi, Linus.
[4349.42 → 4351.92] I wish I was on your Twitter list on your live stream.
[4352.16 → 4352.82] Okay, Brendan.
[4352.82 → 4359.16] Yes, but you have to replace it once in a while.
[4360.82 → 4363.10] I actually don't know.
[4363.20 → 4364.16] I think it's probably close.
[4364.80 → 4366.40] It should be a little bit better than Linfield.
[4367.16 → 4368.60] Coffee crisp are awesome.
[4369.88 → 4373.04] And Wonder Bars and Old Dutch ketchup chips are awesome too.
[4374.20 → 4374.48] Whoa!
[4374.86 → 4376.74] Star Citizen reached 4 million today?
[4376.92 → 4381.38] Yeah, I don't think it displays on their Kickstarter page because Kickstarter doesn't show all of their forms of funding.
[4381.38 → 4382.32] No, but I didn't look at that.
[4382.38 → 4385.72] I looked at Robert's Space Industries.
[4385.72 → 4386.44] Don't you get the emails?
[4387.12 → 4388.24] I guess you get a billion emails.
[4388.56 → 4388.84] Yeah, I get two million emails.
[4388.84 → 4390.24] You haven't actually bought it yet.
[4390.40 → 4391.26] No, I haven't bought it yet.
[4391.26 → 4393.14] If you buy it, you get constant updates.
[4393.38 → 4393.44] Yeah.
[4394.20 → 4395.20] Over 4 million!
[4396.50 → 4397.38] Holy crap.
[4397.70 → 4399.02] So this is that game I'm talking about.
[4399.10 → 4399.96] The Star Citizen game.
[4400.28 → 4402.38] So over 4 million means that...
[4402.38 → 4403.62] Should I just...
[4403.62 → 4404.46] Should I do it now?
[4405.18 → 4405.76] Should I do it now?
[4405.86 → 4406.66] My wife will kill me.
[4407.92 → 4408.52] Should I just...
[4408.52 → 4409.36] Should I just get it?
[4409.98 → 4410.86] I'm not saying anything.
[4410.86 → 4411.74] I don't want her to hate me.
[4411.92 → 4414.64] She's not watching this livestream right now, so she'd never know.
[4414.88 → 4415.76] Except when she sees...
[4415.76 → 4416.02] New ship!
[4416.22 → 4416.52] New ship!
[4416.60 → 4416.86] New ship!
[4417.02 → 4417.88] Whoa, there's a new ship?
[4418.20 → 4418.66] Is it bigger?
[4418.84 → 4419.58] Oh no, I think...
[4419.58 → 4420.58] Is it the Constellation?
[4421.08 → 4422.06] Drake Cutlass?
[4422.18 → 4422.42] Or...
[4422.42 → 4422.80] I don't know.
[4422.82 → 4423.34] There's no picture.
[4423.50 → 4424.96] Oh, it's probably not one of the...
[4424.96 → 4426.28] It's probably just a new ship in the game.
[4426.40 → 4426.54] Sorry.
[4427.16 → 4427.48] Okay.
[4427.92 → 4428.24] Okay.
[4428.42 → 4428.72] Anyway.
[4428.94 → 4429.92] So yeah, anyway.
[4430.06 → 4431.16] Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[4431.24 → 4433.24] We'll stop talking about Star Citizen now.
[4433.32 → 4434.06] Should I just do it now?
[4435.14 → 4435.80] Are you sure?
[4436.58 → 4437.14] She's gonna...
[4437.14 → 4438.28] Oh, she's going to kill me, man.
[4438.28 → 4440.38] Okay, learn more.
[4441.04 → 4441.66] Okay, reserve...
[4441.66 → 4442.44] Okay, okay, okay.
[4442.52 → 4443.10] I'll do...
[4443.10 → 4443.42] Okay.
[4443.84 → 4447.50] I'll do this after the stream, but yeah, okay.
[4447.60 → 4448.12] I'm going to do it.
[4448.20 → 4448.48] I'm going to do it.
[4448.50 → 4449.54] We're going to have a Constellation.
[4449.80 → 4451.54] Okay, we have to make a video.
[4451.70 → 4452.24] We're gonna...
[4452.24 → 4452.94] We should make a video?
[4453.00 → 4453.54] We should make a video.
[4453.74 → 4454.30] We should make a video?
[4454.40 → 4457.90] Okay, we're going to ball out a Constellation, and yeah.
[4458.00 → 4459.52] Slick's going to be my co-pilot.
[4459.66 → 4460.40] He's my Chewbacca.
[4460.96 → 4462.46] Let's hear your best Chewbacca noise.
[4462.56 → 4463.44] I can't do Chewbacca.
[4463.74 → 4465.26] I know it seems like I can...
[4465.26 → 4466.22] I can't actually...
[4466.22 → 4469.62] See, I can't do it.
[4469.64 → 4470.68] That was more like a...
[4470.68 → 4471.44] I know, I know.
[4471.54 → 4472.12] I can't do it.
[4472.18 → 4472.58] I can't do Chewbacca.
[4472.58 → 4473.30] That was terrible.
[4474.16 → 4475.02] It's depressing.
[4475.16 → 4476.48] That was actually terrible.
[4476.48 → 4476.84] I know.
[4476.94 → 4477.60] I can't do Chewbacca.
[4477.62 → 4478.78] That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
[4479.90 → 4480.60] You're fired.
[4482.50 → 4483.56] Freddie, no!
[4483.56 → 4488.56] Listening to...
[4489.32 → 4490.42] No, no, I haven't.
[4490.50 → 4490.72] Sorry.
[4491.66 → 4492.82] What's your editing process like?
[4492.86 → 4493.74] Who makes the big decisions?
[4495.08 → 4497.06] Yeah, it's called Linus Tech Tips.
[4497.96 → 4499.12] Like, just saying.
[4499.76 → 4500.54] He sucks at editing.
[4500.70 → 4501.12] So do I.
[4501.52 → 4501.74] Yeah.
[4501.96 → 4503.24] Oh, Diesel makes the call.
[4504.10 → 4505.70] I was like, what are you trying to say?
[4506.12 → 4506.86] We're both terrible.
[4508.86 → 4510.56] What's the cheapest Thunderbolt motherboard?
[4510.56 → 4512.88] I think Gigabyte has an MATE one.
[4512.88 → 4514.12] I haven't seen the pricing on it.
[4514.12 → 4514.20] Really?
[4514.20 → 4515.28] It's not available in North America.
[4515.46 → 4516.30] Oh, well, okay.
[4516.44 → 4517.16] Yeah, Murcia.
[4517.80 → 4518.16] MUR.
[4518.22 → 4518.88] North America.
[4520.00 → 4523.42] You heard anything about the G75VX with the 670MX?
[4523.52 → 4524.28] Like, when it'll be released?
[4524.34 → 4524.76] I'm stressing.
[4524.90 → 4525.44] No, I'm sorry.
[4525.50 → 4525.90] I haven't.
[4526.64 → 4527.34] Ah, yes.
[4527.86 → 4528.74] Verdi bags.
[4529.24 → 4530.02] Here, Slick.
[4530.52 → 4531.16] Take it away.
[4533.10 → 4536.44] How much stuff can you fit in an Verdi bag?
[4536.68 → 4538.34] I don't, like, everything.
[4538.66 → 4539.52] It's kind of ridiculous.
[4540.00 → 4540.72] The camera's over there.
[4540.72 → 4541.48] It's kind of ridiculous.
[4541.48 → 4543.04] Let's just, like, random.
[4543.16 → 4544.12] Here, you have to bring it up on your lap.
[4544.62 → 4544.92] Okay.
[4545.10 → 4545.66] Okay, seriously?
[4545.76 → 4546.52] You have your helmet in there?
[4546.62 → 4547.44] I have my helmet in there.
[4548.40 → 4549.08] Bike helmet.
[4549.76 → 4549.98] Okay.
[4549.98 → 4551.12] Power cable.
[4551.42 → 4551.62] Sure.
[4552.90 → 4553.60] Power bar.
[4553.64 → 4554.08] Power bar.
[4554.18 → 4554.66] Ethernet cable.
[4554.66 → 4556.16] You never know when you'll need a power bar.
[4556.94 → 4557.66] My sling.
[4558.02 → 4558.88] Sling for the arm.
[4559.04 → 4559.38] Yeah, okay.
[4559.60 → 4560.68] A book for my mom.
[4562.16 → 4565.42] Uh, the weather shield that goes on it.
[4565.42 → 4566.80] I wear this when I'm on my bike.
[4567.40 → 4570.06] Because my bike doesn't have weather guard over the tires.
[4570.24 → 4571.40] This is all just a ploy.
[4571.50 → 4572.50] Your arm isn't injured at all.
[4572.56 → 4573.46] You're just trying to get chicks.
[4574.36 → 4575.78] I should walk around like this.
[4576.26 → 4578.14] You already have a...
[4578.14 → 4578.60] Anyway.
[4579.32 → 4579.96] Multiple screwdrivers.
[4579.96 → 4581.32] I was talking about baby chickens.
[4581.86 → 4582.26] Okay.
[4582.40 → 4583.34] What were you talking about?
[4584.50 → 4585.22] I don't know.
[4585.22 → 4587.24] Uh, batteries for a wireless mouse.
[4587.58 → 4587.98] Seriously?
[4588.68 → 4590.08] G7 mice in his backpack.
[4590.28 → 4591.18] True nerd or what?
[4592.14 → 4592.80] Beep, rather.
[4593.00 → 4594.68] Another screwdriver thing.
[4596.46 → 4598.06] OCC screwdriver, no less.
[4598.42 → 4600.02] Notepad from Be Quiet.
[4600.96 → 4601.42] Seriously?
[4601.80 → 4602.02] Yep.
[4602.12 → 4603.32] Where'd you get all this swag?
[4603.70 → 4605.00] NVIDIA wrist strap.
[4606.92 → 4608.20] Where did you get this?
[4609.00 → 4609.54] I don't know.
[4610.52 → 4611.52] I don't even remember.
[4612.34 → 4612.82] Let's see.
[4613.02 → 4613.38] Let's see.
[4614.00 → 4615.36] Uh, thermal paste.
[4615.48 → 4616.24] Thermal paste.
[4616.44 → 4616.84] Nice.
[4617.48 → 4618.22] Very nice.
[4618.28 → 4619.82] I could go for a really, really long time.
[4619.82 → 4620.66] Is your laptop in there?
[4620.88 → 4621.80] My laptop's in there.
[4621.84 → 4622.08] Oh, yeah.
[4622.14 → 4622.42] Of course.
[4622.52 → 4623.48] Laptop's got to be in there.
[4623.98 → 4624.22] Okay.
[4624.28 → 4624.84] Laptop.
[4624.94 → 4625.54] There we go.
[4626.38 → 4627.66] What other cool stuff we got here?
[4628.28 → 4629.14] Tons of different papers.
[4629.14 → 4631.14] Oh, is this the new Joan Rowling book?
[4631.32 → 4631.50] Yep.
[4632.12 → 4633.06] Oh, I haven't...
[4633.06 → 4634.86] I didn't even know it was out yet.
[4636.24 → 4636.64] Oh.
[4636.80 → 4637.02] Oh.
[4637.26 → 4637.56] Yes.
[4638.02 → 4638.38] Yes.
[4638.88 → 4639.58] No way.
[4639.58 → 4639.94] Yeah.
[4640.88 → 4641.86] You're such a dark...
[4641.86 → 4646.98] You know, when he showed up for his job interview, he had a Super Nintendo with him.
[4647.74 → 4649.44] Like, carrying it under his arm.
[4650.74 → 4651.66] What do you get there?
[4651.74 → 4652.70] Oh, they won't be able to see it.
[4652.78 → 4653.14] What is that?
[4653.14 → 4653.84] It's Pokémon Blue.
[4653.98 → 4654.14] Pokémon Blue.
[4654.14 → 4655.86] It's my original one from when I was a little kid.
[4655.92 → 4657.04] That's why you probably can't read it.
[4657.04 → 4658.04] Oh.
[4658.04 → 4659.04] Wow.
[4659.04 → 4660.28] My new computer case for my S3.
[4660.40 → 4661.12] The box for it.
[4661.12 → 4662.12] Oh.
[4662.12 → 4663.12] Oh.
[4663.12 → 4664.12] Pills.
[4664.12 → 4665.12] Oh.
[4665.12 → 4666.12] Oh.
[4666.12 → 4667.12] Oh.
[4667.12 → 4668.12] Oh.
[4668.12 → 4669.12] Oh.
[4669.12 → 4670.12] Oh.
[4670.12 → 4671.12] Oh.
[4671.12 → 4672.12] It's...
[4672.12 → 4673.12] Oh.
[4673.12 → 4674.12] Oh.
[4674.12 → 4675.12] Oh.
[4675.12 → 4676.12] Oh.
[4676.12 → 4677.12] Oh.
[4677.12 → 4678.12] Oh.
[4678.12 → 4679.12] Oh.
[4679.12 → 4680.12] Oh.
[4680.12 → 4681.12] Oh.
[4681.12 → 4682.12] I'm not actually that worried about that.
[4682.12 → 4684.12] That's still my original one too anyway.
[4684.12 → 4685.12] Ribbon, Ethernet cable.
[4685.12 → 4686.12] Ew.
[4686.12 → 4687.12] My mouth is probably dirty.
[4687.12 → 4688.12] Oh.
[4688.12 → 4689.12] These are the best.
[4689.12 → 4690.12] Yup.
[4690.12 → 4691.12] Is this the one I gave you?
[4691.12 → 4692.12] Yup.
[4692.12 → 4693.12] Notebook.
[4693.12 → 4694.12] So.
[4694.12 → 4695.12] Ever key bags.
[4695.12 → 4696.12] Yay or nay?
[4696.12 → 4698.12] Can we give it the old yay?
[4698.12 → 4702.12] I could probably keep going for like 10 minutes, and it's not even half full.
[4702.12 → 4703.12] NCI lanyard.
[4703.12 → 4704.12] That's interesting.
[4704.12 → 4705.12] More glasses.
[4705.12 → 4706.12] That got awkward.
[4706.12 → 4707.12] Real fast.
[4707.12 → 4708.12] Okay.
[4708.12 → 4709.12] Note to self.
[4709.12 → 4710.12] Don't look in another dude's bag.
[4710.12 → 4711.12] Yeah.
[4711.12 → 4712.12] There are tons of stuff.
[4712.12 → 4713.12] Can you solve a Rubik's Cube?
[4713.12 → 4714.12] Me?
[4714.12 → 4715.12] Yeah.
[4715.12 → 4716.12] I have before.
[4716.12 → 4717.12] I can't.
[4717.12 → 4718.12] I'm not very fast because I don't know like...
[4718.12 → 4719.12] It's all mathematics.
[4719.12 → 4720.12] I don't understand it at all.
[4720.12 → 4721.12] You can...
[4721.12 → 4722.12] There's like a formula for solving the whole thing.
[4722.12 → 4723.12] I can't.
[4723.12 → 4724.12] I can't.
[4724.12 → 4725.12] I can't.
[4725.12 → 4726.12] I can't.
[4726.12 → 4727.12] There's like a formula for solving the whole thing.
[4727.12 → 4728.12] Do you even lift?
[4728.12 → 4729.12] Yes.
[4729.12 → 4730.12] I even lift.
[4730.12 → 4731.12] Not that often.
[4731.12 → 4732.12] Not as much as I should.
[4732.12 → 4737.12] I'm sort of a Shaw guy myself.
[4737.12 → 4738.12] I'm Shaw too.
[4738.12 → 4740.12] It depends on where you are.
[4740.12 → 4741.12] I think.
[4741.12 → 4747.12] I think this is ridiculous.
[4747.12 → 4752.12] Because the OS is so big on a Windows tablet that there's not that much storage space left
[4752.12 → 4753.12] over.
[4753.12 → 4754.12] So?
[4754.12 → 4755.12] So you should just return it.
[4755.12 → 4756.12] Yeah.
[4756.12 → 4757.12] Not sue.
[4757.12 → 4758.12] Yeah.
[4758.12 → 4759.12] Yeah.
[4759.12 → 4760.12] Yeah.
[4760.12 → 4761.12] America.
[4761.12 → 4762.12] America.
[4762.12 → 4763.12] You're an American citizen right?
[4763.12 → 4764.12] I'm an American citizen.
[4764.12 → 4765.12] So we can...
[4765.12 → 4767.12] Well you can say that.
[4767.12 → 4768.12] Yeah you can.
[4768.12 → 4769.12] Okay.
[4769.12 → 4770.12] Is that like the...
[4770.12 → 4771.12] Yeah.
[4771.12 → 4772.12] That's the rules.
[4772.12 → 4773.12] Yeah.
[4773.12 → 4774.12] Yeah.
[4774.12 → 4775.12] Yeah.
[4775.12 → 4776.12] Yeah.
[4776.12 → 4777.12] Like I can make fun of Canadians all I want.
[4777.12 → 4780.12] Canadians don't know anything about anything other than like hockey and beer and like lumber jacking.
[4780.12 → 4781.12] Lumber jacking.
[4781.12 → 4782.12] Lumber jacking.
[4782.12 → 4783.12] And that's what it should be called.
[4783.12 → 4785.12] Logging should be called lumber jacking.
[4785.12 → 4786.12] That would be epic.
[4786.12 → 4787.12] And like lumber jacking could...
[4787.12 → 4788.12] You know what?
[4788.12 → 4789.12] Okay.
[4789.12 → 4790.12] Get this.
[4790.12 → 4791.12] New video game concept.
[4791.12 → 4794.12] You're like this lumberjack, and you like...
[4794.12 → 4797.12] It's like Grand Theft Auto except you're like...
[4797.12 → 4800.12] You take over like barges and stuff.
[4800.12 → 4801.12] And you just...
[4801.12 → 4805.12] Like it's a sandbox game where like the...
[4805.12 → 4808.12] You're like part of the underworld of like lumber jacking.
[4808.12 → 4812.12] And you like steal cars, and you steal other people's trees and stuff.
[4812.12 → 4813.12] You know...
[4813.12 → 4814.12] You smuggle shipments of hemp.
[4814.12 → 4816.12] It could be an MMO.
[4816.12 → 4817.12] Whole economy.
[4817.12 → 4820.12] I mean if the economy of BC could be based on lumber...
[4820.12 → 4823.12] The lumber industry then it's certainly a game.
[4823.12 → 4825.12] Raid the Hydro Dam.
[4825.12 → 4826.12] Yeah.
[4826.12 → 4827.12] That'd be awesome.
[4827.12 → 4828.12] Okay.
[4828.12 → 4830.12] Would you guys buy lumber jacking the game?
[4830.12 → 4831.12] Please.
[4831.12 → 4832.12] Do tweet.
[4832.12 → 4833.12] Or let us know in the Twitch chat.
[4833.12 → 4834.12] Kickstarter.
[4834.12 → 4835.12] Yeah Kickstarter.
[4835.12 → 4839.12] If Slick and I made lumber jacking the game.
[4839.12 → 4842.12] I need to change it.
[4842.12 → 4844.12] Hi Marius.
[4844.12 → 4846.12] Slick what do you think about Linux?
[4846.12 → 4847.12] He likes it.
[4847.12 → 4848.12] I won't let him answer.
[4848.12 → 4849.12] Okay.
[4849.12 → 4851.12] Fred wants to know how old we are.
[4851.12 → 4853.12] I've said this multiple times.
[4853.12 → 4854.12] I'm 11 teen.
[4854.12 → 4855.12] 11 teen?
[4855.12 → 4860.12] So that's 21.
[4860.12 → 4863.12] I'm not 21.
[4863.12 → 4864.12] I know.
[4864.12 → 4865.12] Okay.
[4865.12 → 4866.12] I don't understand.
[4866.12 → 4868.12] Okay well I'm 26 at any rate.
[4868.12 → 4870.12] And he's younger than me but not by much.
[4870.12 → 4871.12] So there you go.
[4871.12 → 4872.12] Yeah see?
[4872.12 → 4873.12] Jordan's with us.
[4873.12 → 4875.12] Wagon wheels used to be good, and they do-
[4875.12 → 4877.12] Oh man that thing tasted funky.
[4877.12 → 4878.12] It's-
[4878.12 → 4879.12] Seriously.
[4879.12 → 4883.12] Like that game cartridge left a terrible taste in my mouth.
[4883.12 → 4885.12] I've had that since I was like what?
[4885.12 → 4886.12] 12?
[4886.12 → 4887.12] Okay.
[4887.12 → 4890.12] Yeah wagon wheels suck now.
[4890.12 → 4892.12] Slick how's your hand?
[4892.12 → 4893.12] Um.
[4893.12 → 4896.12] It looks like this.
[4896.12 → 4898.12] That's not very good.
[4898.12 → 4899.12] Whatever.
[4899.12 → 4900.12] It still hurts like hell.
[4900.12 → 4902.12] My knuckles are all messed up still but eh.
[4902.12 → 4903.12] Best way to learn to overclock?
[4903.12 → 4904.12] Trial and error?
[4904.12 → 4905.12] Overclock.
[4905.12 → 4906.12] Overclock.
[4906.12 → 4907.12] There we go.
[4907.12 → 4908.12] We'll see you at the end.
[4908.12 → 4909.12] Read some posts.
[4909.12 → 4910.12] Yup.
[4910.12 → 4911.12] Um.
[4911.12 → 4912.12] What is that?
[4912.12 → 4913.12] Okay.
[4913.12 → 4915.12] Okay why don't we do-
[4915.12 → 4917.12] Do we have any other cool topics or are we pretty much out of topics?
[4917.12 → 4919.12] I covered I think my last one.
[4919.12 → 4922.12] Oh we never talked about the green drive update.
[4922.12 → 4923.12] Okay.
[4923.12 → 4924.12] So we'll go really fast.
[4924.12 → 4925.12] Green drives are faster now.
[4925.12 → 4926.12] Yeah.
[4926.12 → 4930.12] They went from 125 megabytes per second writes to 150 megabytes per second writes and they
[4930.12 → 4931.12] went from-
[4931.12 → 4932.12] Yeah.
[4932.12 → 4933.12] And it was about the same for reads.
[4933.12 → 4934.12] Yeah.
[4934.12 → 4935.12] The scaling was about the same.
[4935.12 → 4938.12] So it was about an outright 20% improvement in performance.
[4938.12 → 4939.12] Yeah.
[4939.12 → 4940.12] Like across the board which is awesome.
[4940.12 → 4942.12] And now they come with 3D balance.
[4942.12 → 4943.12] Yeah.
[4943.12 → 4945.12] Which means they don't vibrate, and they should in theory last longer.
[4945.12 → 4946.12] Yup.
[4946.12 → 4947.12] Um.
[4947.12 → 4949.12] They have a way more advanced head technology now.
[4949.12 → 4953.12] It's similar to what WD's been using in enterprise drives which is cool.
[4953.12 → 4954.12] One terabyte platters.
[4954.12 → 4955.12] Which is good.
[4955.12 → 4958.12] Fewer moving parts is always better for mechanical things.
[4958.12 → 4962.12] I mean look how many moving parts you have and look how defective you are.
[4962.12 → 4963.12] Look at your arm.
[4963.12 → 4964.12] Look at your arm.
[4964.12 → 4965.12] Whatever man.
[4965.12 → 4966.12] I can do this.
[4966.12 → 4967.12] Bam.
[4967.12 → 4968.12] Yeah.
[4968.12 → 4969.12] Wrong arm.
[4969.12 → 4970.12] Oh yeah?
[4970.12 → 4971.12] I can do this.
[4971.12 → 4972.12] Oh.
[4972.12 → 4973.12] I lose.
[4973.12 → 4974.12] Okay.
[4974.12 → 4975.12] If you two-
[4975.12 → 4976.12] Oh here we go.
[4976.12 → 4977.12] Here we go.
[4977.12 → 4978.12] Here we go.
[4978.12 → 4983.12] If we made lumber jacking the game, Christo92355052 would buy it.
[4983.12 → 4984.12] Excellent.
[4984.12 → 4985.12] If you guys make it, I'll buy it.
[4985.12 → 4986.12] Awesome.
[4986.12 → 4987.12] We should totally make lumber jacking the game.
[4987.12 → 4988.12] Thanks guys.
[4988.12 → 4989.12] Uh, can you, uh, Ever key Beacon for the win?
[4989.12 → 4990.12] Yup.
[4990.12 → 4991.12] Yup.
[4991.12 → 4992.12] Yup.
[4992.12 → 4993.12] Yup.
[4993.12 → 4994.12] Yup.
[4994.12 → 4995.12] Yup.
[4995.12 → 4996.12] Yup.
[4996.12 → 4997.12] Yup.
[4997.12 → 4998.12] Yup.
[4998.12 → 4999.12] Yup.
[4999.12 → 5000.12] Yup.
[5000.12 → 5001.12] Awesome.
[5001.12 → 5003.12] There's a game called Woodcutting Simulator 2012.
[5003.12 → 5005.12] There are so many of these simulator games.
[5005.12 → 5006.12] You have got to be kidding me.
[5006.12 → 5011.12] Farm Simulator 2012 or 2013 or something beat out, uh, Modern Warfare 3.
[5011.12 → 5012.12] Okay.
[5012.12 → 5013.12] Is this real?
[5013.12 → 5014.12] Yeah.
[5014.12 → 5015.12] No way.
[5015.12 → 5016.12] I'm pretty sure it is.
[5016.12 → 5017.12] Look up Farm Simulator-
[5017.12 → 5018.12] Multiplayer edition?
[5018.12 → 5021.12] Look up, um, Farm Simulator versus Modern Warfare 3.
[5021.12 → 5022.12] Okay.
[5022.12 → 5026.12] Um, are you sure that's not fake?
[5026.12 → 5027.12] I'm pretty damn sure.
[5027.12 → 5028.12] Okay, Wood, Wood.
[5028.12 → 5029.12] No, Farm Simulator.
[5029.12 → 5030.12] No, no, I want to look this up.
[5030.12 → 5031.12] Oh, this.
[5031.12 → 5032.12] This I have no idea.
[5032.12 → 5033.12] 20- There's a demo.
[5033.12 → 5034.12] No way.
[5034.12 → 5035.12] There is a demo.
[5035.12 → 5038.12] Oh, my goodness.
[5038.12 → 5040.12] Okay, extreme woodcutting.
[5040.12 → 5041.12] You might want to be.
[5041.12 → 5042.12] Oh, sorry, sorry.
[5042.12 → 5044.12] Okay, extreme woodcutting.
[5044.12 → 5045.12] It's not muted, it's just left.
[5045.12 → 5046.12] No.
[5046.12 → 5047.12] Freaking.
[5047.12 → 5048.12] Way.
[5048.12 → 5050.12] He's not lined up properly.
[5050.12 → 5052.12] Come on, this guy's a noob.
[5052.12 → 5053.12] No.
[5053.12 → 5054.12] Freaking.
[5054.12 → 5055.12] Way.
[5055.12 → 5058.12] You are not in the-
[5058.12 → 5059.12] No.
[5059.12 → 5060.12] Freaking.
[5060.12 → 5061.12] Way.
[5061.12 → 5062.12] This does not exist.
[5062.12 → 5063.12] Okay.
[5063.12 → 5068.12] Okay, well, it looks like I've been beat to the punch here.
[5068.12 → 5071.12] With my epic woodcutting, simulate lumber jacking idea.
[5071.12 → 5072.12] It's even multiplayer.
[5072.12 → 5073.12] How is this-
[5073.12 → 5074.12] But it's not GTA version.
[5074.12 → 5075.12] You can't steal.
[5075.12 → 5076.12] Not good enough.
[5076.12 → 5077.12] How is this even a game?
[5077.12 → 5078.12] I'm serious.
[5078.12 → 5079.12] Okay, fine, fine, fine.
[5079.12 → 5080.12] Farm simulator.
[5080.12 → 5081.12] I don't know which one.
[5081.12 → 5084.12] Farm simulator versus Modern Warfare 3.
[5084.12 → 5085.12] Okay.
[5085.12 → 5086.12] Farming simulator epic ness.
[5086.12 → 5087.12] No, there's no way that's right.
[5087.12 → 5090.12] Okay, we can check out the farm simulator epic ness though.
[5090.12 → 5091.12] I'll try to find it.
[5091.12 → 5092.12] Okay.
[5092.12 → 5093.12] Come on.
[5093.12 → 5094.12] So you dirt bike around?
[5094.12 → 5095.12] Is that what this is?
[5095.12 → 5097.12] This is epic ness, so it's probably not what it's intended for.
[5097.12 → 5098.12] It doesn't even fall.
[5098.12 → 5099.12] Look at the physics.
[5099.12 → 5100.12] Look at the physics.
[5100.12 → 5101.12] He's riding a motorcycle sideways.
[5101.12 → 5103.12] The graphics kind of remind me of our-
[5103.12 → 5104.12] What is he doing?
[5104.12 → 5105.12] I don't know.
[5105.12 → 5106.12] This is terrible.
[5106.12 → 5108.12] This is terrible.
[5108.12 → 5110.12] This is terrible, I can't watch this.
[5110.12 → 5111.12] My head just wants to explode now.
[5111.12 → 5116.12] Okay, well, bah.
[5116.12 → 5122.12] ALO like.
[5122.12 → 5127.12] You Atari is the head of your-
[5127.12 → 5131.12] Oh, hey, the athlete Errol.
[5131.12 → 5139.68] Okay, I can't handle this anymore.
[5139.68 → 5142.90] Okay I think we're done for the livestream for tonight guys.
[5142.90 → 5144.80] Thank you for watching, thank you for tuning in.
[5144.80 → 5146.18] Slick are you going to be joining us next week?
[5146.18 → 5147.18] What do you think?
[5147.18 → 5148.18] Yeah, I plan to.
[5148.18 → 5151.80] Okay, so Slick is planning to continue to join the livestreams, so that's going to be
[5151.80 → 5153.56] good, that's going to be fun.
[5153.56 → 5156.18] And we will check out the contest.
[5156.18 → 5160.06] Okay, yes, we're going to deal with the contest entries now.
[5160.06 → 5165.52] I would love for you guys to tweet at me or, what's the other ways people can...
[5165.52 → 5169.24] Tweet at Slick, at Slick PC, the thing here, see that one.
[5169.24 → 5175.46] At Slick PC, it's like pointing at your crotch, it's like, tweet there.
[5175.46 → 5180.88] Tweet at Slick PC if you think we should spend more or less time on Twitter Q&A, or if you
[5180.88 → 5184.94] prefer the more like panel discussion things on the topics that we come up with.
[5184.94 → 5189.24] Or should we follow on focus topics like we think of, or just random stuff like we seem
[5189.24 → 5190.24] to do.
[5190.24 → 5194.70] Yeah, guys, we want your input on the show because ultimately the idea is we want to
[5194.70 → 5199.76] have an awesome livestream for you every week, so let us know what you want, and thank you,
