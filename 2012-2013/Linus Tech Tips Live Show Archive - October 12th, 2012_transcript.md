[0.00 --> 7.60]  And we're hopefully actually live this time. I guess you guys in the Twitch chat will have to let me know how we're doing here.
[9.12 --> 10.30]  Are we live?
[13.62 --> 21.24]  Blind says we're just seeing the Linus Jobs image. Wait, hold on. Some people are seeing it. I'm getting nopes. I'm getting one person said it's up.
[21.30 --> 25.78]  But sometimes that's just trolling and that's not actually helpful.
[26.26 --> 28.34]  Wait, now there's more people saying it's up.
[28.34 --> 34.34]  Yes, we're live. Awesome. Okay, which means that now I have to go and...
[35.54 --> 42.34]  Oh, live stream is on after all. Join us.
[43.34 --> 49.00]  And I'm going to change the name of the video that I created on YouTube so that people would be able to join the live stream.
[49.00 --> 53.78]  And I changed it then to Twitch TV is having problems and so the live stream is cancelled.
[53.78 --> 59.78]  So pretty much everyone who looked at that video is now not going to join the live stream anymore.
[59.78 --> 61.78]  And...
[61.78 --> 65.78]  Oh, what a shame. What a shame. What a shame.
[65.78 --> 71.78]  So hopefully you guys have noticed that I have a completely new setup tonight.
[71.78 --> 78.78]  So I am no longer using a webcam. In fact, the webcam that I was using is not even here anymore.
[78.78 --> 86.78]  And not only is the webcam not here anymore, but this sound card and the other sound cards and the onboard sound that drove me crazy.
[86.78 --> 89.78]  None of that... I don't even need this anymore. Why am I even wearing this?
[89.78 --> 98.78]  Pointless. Okay, so the sound card that I was using before, the microphones, everything you guys have been complaining about is fixed. Totally fixed.
[98.78 --> 104.78]  Now I haven't done much in terms of tweaking the actual streaming quality within Twitch TV.
[104.78 --> 112.78]  But what I have done is I have upgraded my camera. I have upgraded my microphone. I have upgraded my lighting.
[112.78 --> 115.78]  Is the lighting okay? Because I can turn it up. I can turn it down.
[115.78 --> 120.78]  I have upgraded my capture device. So I'm going to give you guys a...yeah.
[120.78 --> 125.78]  See? Everyone on Twitch chat is going crazy. They're saying it's outstanding. So it's great, right?
[125.78 --> 129.78]  It's good. It looks like...like...like production quality kind of thing.
[130.78 --> 131.78]  Yes! Alright!
[132.78 --> 138.78]  That is fantastic. I'm so happy to hear that because I know I've been promising you guys...
[139.78 --> 142.78]  I'm promising you guys that I'm going to upgrade the equipment.
[142.78 --> 144.78]  And don't worry, we're not going to be stuck with this forever.
[144.78 --> 148.78]  I mean, remember how my face used to have like this deathly power of whiteness?
[148.78 --> 156.78]  Because basically all I could do with my countertop set up here was have my laptop sitting here.
[156.78 --> 163.78]  And then I could just turn on all the lights in this room which is really not enough for like a production environment.
[163.78 --> 167.78]  And then like my face was always whited out because the camera was way too close.
[167.78 --> 172.78]  But I couldn't move any further away and just...everything was bad and everything was terrible.
[172.78 --> 177.78]  And Diesel's texting me right now. He's asking, did you change the picture profile?
[177.78 --> 180.78]  And I don't know, man. I don't know what's going on.
[180.78 --> 184.78]  And all I know is you guys are saying that everything is good.
[184.78 --> 190.78]  No! Tool1289 cannot have my old equipment because we will still be using the old equipment.
[190.78 --> 195.78]  Now, a lot of people on my unboxing of the FS700 were a little bit critical.
[195.78 --> 199.78]  They were a little bit critical of how much money I spent on a camera for YouTube unboxings.
[199.78 --> 205.78]  However, there are big plans that involve far more than just unboxings on YouTube.
[205.78 --> 208.78]  That is the tip of the iceberg.
[208.78 --> 212.78]  That is not what the plan is for this uber expensive camera.
[212.78 --> 214.78]  Okay?
[214.78 --> 217.78]  Um, and but we will still be using the XA10.
[217.78 --> 220.78]  We'll still be using the other equipment just in different ways.
[220.78 --> 222.78]  So I want like a dual camera set up.
[222.78 --> 224.78]  I want an A roll and a B roll.
[224.78 --> 227.78]  I want the A roll to be awesome.
[227.78 --> 234.78]  When the 4K firmware upgrade comes out for this camera, you guys can bet I will be upgrading it to it immediately.
[234.78 --> 238.78]  So that we can start capturing 4K video.
[238.78 --> 243.78]  Whether it's Linus Tech Tips or whether it's, you know, cats or any other channel.
[243.78 --> 245.78]  You know, depending on what we end up doing.
[245.78 --> 252.78]  But I want to be the first one to bring 4K video of all kinds of cool stuff to the YouTubes in a blog style.
[252.78 --> 257.78]  Which means, you know, we'll actually have sort of volume of content going on.
[257.78 --> 264.78]  So we're trying to get together the resources to put together like an editing machine and capture machine that can actually capture.
[264.78 --> 271.78]  Like, honestly guys, I've got a velociraptor in the machine that I'm using right now to capture the HDMI stream.
[271.78 --> 275.78]  In fact, I'll give you guys a tour of the new setup very shortly here.
[275.78 --> 277.78]  But I've got a velociraptor that I'm using for that.
[277.78 --> 284.78]  And, um, when I ran the test with the Blackmagic Intensity Pro card, it basically gave me like a...
[284.78 --> 288.78]  Oh, this isn't good enough to capture 1080p.
[288.78 --> 294.78]  Okay, so 4K is going to be about 4 times the bandwidth requirements of 1080p.
[294.78 --> 297.78]  Which means I would basically need, like the velociraptor is so borderline.
[297.78 --> 305.78]  So I would basically need, like, a couple SSDs in RAID 0 to capture it per stream.
[305.78 --> 307.78]  And who knows, we might have more than one stream.
[307.78 --> 313.78]  Okay, so I'd need a couple of those or I'd need like 4 hard drives in RAID 0 just to capture this footage.
[313.78 --> 323.78]  And when I captured about 45 seconds of HDMI 1080p, sorry, HDMI 1080p footage, I was getting like 1 plus gigabyte file sizes.
[323.78 --> 328.78]  So when we're capturing 4K, every minute should be about 8 gigs.
[328.78 --> 333.78]  And yes, Tetraski, I know that MaxRes on YouTube is 1080p.
[333.78 --> 336.78]  4K filming can be pointless all you want.
[336.78 --> 343.78]  However, YouTube is capable of outputting, I believe, it's 2.5K.
[343.78 --> 349.78]  And downsampled 4K will always look better than something that was captured at 1080p.
[349.78 --> 359.78]  You can say it's useless all you want, but the future is something that we have to actually plan for around here.
[359.78 --> 369.78]  So I'm not going to invest in equipment that when 4K gets enabled, when everyone can actually afford to buy a 4K TV, I'm going to be ready for it.
[369.78 --> 371.78]  So, exciting, exciting stuff.
[371.78 --> 374.78]  So yeah, I'll give you guys a tour of the new setup.
[374.78 --> 381.78]  So first of all, there's this. Check this out.
[381.78 --> 386.78]  So this is like the case that my new lights came in. Like this is the case.
[386.78 --> 391.78]  I got the kit, so it comes with pretty much everything you need, except, I mean of all things, it doesn't come with bulbs.
[391.78 --> 395.78]  So I had to actually buy bulbs. So there's that. Okay.
[395.78 --> 399.78]  And then I'm going to just go ahead and, oh, check this out. You guys are going to love this. You guys are going to love this.
[399.78 --> 406.78]  So we've got a new tripod. Now, I hope I don't mess it up. I think I'm on autofocus right now. So let me see.
[406.78 --> 410.78]  Yeah, I'm on autofocus right now, so it should be fine. So check out the new tripod.
[410.78 --> 418.78]  This is like how smoothly I can pan around. And I'm not nearly as good at this stuff as diesel.
[418.78 --> 425.78]  But our new Manfrotto tripod is awesome. Maybe I'll give you guys a quick tour of my kitchen here.
[425.78 --> 432.78]  So that's where I keep my glassware. And then this is where I keep other glassware and like cups and stuff.
[432.78 --> 439.78]  And this is my microwave. And this right here is the meat for my dinner, which I have.
[439.78 --> 445.78]  And this is my dinner, which I haven't had a chance to eat yet because I love you guys more than I love nourishing my body.
[445.78 --> 453.78]  And there's a pot with the curry that I'm going to eat tomorrow in it, which is super exciting because it's my favorite thing ever.
[453.78 --> 463.78]  This is my fridge. I just I love this new setup so much, so very much. It's just way too awesome.
[463.78 --> 473.78]  There's my little like glass roof sort of breakfast nook thing that's going on. There's my classic AMD 64 water bottle that I covered in AMD stickers.
[473.78 --> 479.78]  These are the new lights. So I've got two of these. These are Kino Flow something or others, 40 something.
[479.78 --> 486.78]  Diva light. Diva light 4-0 something, I think. And they're awesome. And then over there is my water cooler.
[486.78 --> 492.78]  And then here's my dishes and my there's my breakfast cereal. Apple cinnamon Cheerios for the win. Am I right?
[492.78 --> 504.78]  See, there's more IT branded water bottles. Got my Asus water bottle. And I think we're pretty much done here except for the most exciting part, which is my capture PC.
[504.78 --> 511.78]  So the capture PC. Let's go ahead and test it with zoom here. So I just got the kit lens for the FS 700, which means that it does have a zoom on it.
[511.78 --> 523.78]  It was only about a $600 adder. So let's get in pretty close there. So there on the left hand side is the Blackmagic Intensity Pro.
[523.78 --> 533.78]  So there's my HDMI in. And then on the right hand side is an Avermedia Live Gamer HD. So the Intensity Pro isn't quite working yet with my XA10.
[533.78 --> 539.78]  So I'm hoping that if that doesn't work, then I can either use the Avermedia or Avermedia has another one. So look at this.
[539.78 --> 547.78]  Even when I'm zoomed right in, I can still pan reasonably well. Although it's not that great. So let's have a look at the I.O.
[547.78 --> 554.78]  Let's see how the audio focus does here. Oh, that looks so good. Like how much better is this than what we've been doing in the past, you guys?
[558.78 --> 565.78]  And then we can see like, I don't know, pieces for the camera that are over here. I mean, now I'm just playing.
[565.78 --> 575.78]  But yeah, let's go ahead and go back to back to the normal shot. So right about there. Hopefully this is right.
[575.78 --> 582.78]  It might not be right. So I really hope you guys have enjoyed the actual little. Oh, yeah. See, I didn't get it right.
[582.78 --> 588.78]  I got my head cut off, which is not a good thing. But it goes to show you guys like, okay, camera's important.
[588.78 --> 593.78]  Like, yes, we did invest a lot on the camera. But lights are like equally important.
[593.78 --> 600.78]  I mean, people freaked out when I did the FS700 unboxing. I'm like, yeah, we spent $8,500 on a camera.
[600.78 --> 606.78]  But actually those lights just for two of them was over three grand as well, which makes a huge difference.
[606.78 --> 613.78]  But if you get lights that can be easily adjusted to these have dimmers built in, you can use four or two lights at a time, whatever you want.
[613.78 --> 619.78]  They're very portable. They come with transportation. You don't have to adjust the color temperature really.
[619.78 --> 629.78]  They're very much like a natural studio light. Whereas the ones we use for NCIX Tech Tips are not as...
[629.78 --> 636.78]  They're like a very yellow light. They're incandescent, which is, I guess, nice because you don't get any flicker no matter what you're doing.
[636.78 --> 643.78]  But it's just... There's other challenges associated with it. So yeah, that's cool. Everything's cool.
[643.78 --> 648.78]  Oh, oh, I have to show you guys this. Okay, so sorry. I actually don't have Twitch set up properly
[648.78 --> 652.78]  because the stream sort of started at the last minute tonight and everything was a bit of a disaster.
[652.78 --> 657.78]  So bear with me. We're gonna have a black screen for a second here. No, we apparently aren't.
[678.78 --> 679.78]  10. Okay.
[679.78 --> 680.78]  Be careful.
[680.78 --> 681.78]  I want me to...
[681.78 --> 682.04]  10.
[682.04 --> 682.78]  0 friends
[682.78 --> 683.78]  Caesar
[683.78 --> 684.78]  So maybe you.
[684.78 --> 685.78]  It's gonna have gypsy.
[685.78 --> 686.88]  All right there.
[686.88 --> 687.78]  Again, you're exactly my parents.
[687.78 --> 688.78]  Now you have to answer somebody here at!!!
[688.78 --> 689.78]  And cuz I was sitting here at their lives.
[689.78 --> 690.78]  When I came up with this simple fazer mall centro of florida.
[690.78 --> 691.78]  I'll침量 canyon.
[691.78 --> 692.78]  I was gonna have the pods consolida.
[692.78 --> 693.78]  Now you can answer Santa in their pocket.
[693.78 --> 694.78]  It's gonna have to.
[694.78 --> 695.78]  They owe me two shorts.
[695.78 --> 696.78]  I kept going put on the top 정ование just below ...
[696.78 --> 697.78]  I was gonna have to win and then give up.
[697.78 --> 700.78]  It's gonna make fun work.
[700.78 --> 701.78]  So then you can answer my parents we gotta h—
[701.78 --> 703.78]  It's gonna show you guys.
[703.78 --> 704.78]  Yeah, everybody.
[704.78 --> 705.78]  You can answer your parents.
[705.78 --> 717.74]  ...due to my computer right now, but like how freaking awesome is this new camera?
[717.74 --> 729.46]  You know, I didn't even realize that the slow-mo guys on YouTube, I thought they had like a 25,000 FPS camera or something like that in order to capture some of the stuff that they're doing.
[729.46 --> 744.86]  But what I've realized now is that they've only got a 2500 FPS camera, which means we can capture in broad daylight when we can keep the color quality reasonably good, we can capture up to 960 FPS at one quarter of 1080p.
[744.86 --> 751.86]  So I'll let you guys process that for a minute. We can do a two second burst and someone can't hear the sound? Oh yeah, there's no sound on that video guys.
[751.86 --> 762.26]  Okay, so we can do a two second burst at 960 FPS, we can do a four second burst at 480 FPS. So that's what you guys saw in that video there, which is amazing.
[762.26 --> 767.86]  I mean, I know the color kind of sucks, but we were in the Tech Tips studio where we didn't have the best lighting, it wasn't outdoors.
[767.86 --> 777.86]  So that means we can do kind of a fifth to a third, sort of, of what they're able to do in terms of slow motion capture, which is really exciting because I love slow-mo.
[777.86 --> 789.86]  Slow-mo is so cool. Like, okay, we're just, you know what? We're just gonna, we're gonna go back, we're gonna go back and, uh, line of slow-mo, yeah, line of slow-mo tips, indeed.
[789.86 --> 817.86]  There's something like that.
[817.86 --> 825.86]  There's something like that. So it's no surprise that the table almost buckled under the strain of supporting his enormous weight.
[825.86 --> 833.86]  And that's possible he's watching this and, uh, two dads lick your fat and there's, there's nothing else really to say about it.
[833.86 --> 835.86]  Now, hold on. Give me, give me a sec here, guys.
[835.86 --> 843.86]  I've forgotten how to do this because I always had it sort of set up and then I never really thought about it.
[843.86 --> 859.86]  Uh, remove. Okay, so we'll switch to, we'll switch to this one now and then I'm gonna just remove this one and I'm gonna zoom in on my Twitter.
[859.86 --> 877.86]  And we're almost actually set up. I'm so sorry that I'm not as prepared as, as I would have liked to be tonight.
[877.86 --> 885.86]  But it was all about getting this new camera going for me here, guys. So I really, really, really wanted to do that tonight.
[885.86 --> 895.86]  And I honestly didn't get home until about 7.30. So I basically said hi to the baby and then, uh, hi to my wife.
[895.86 --> 904.86]  And, um, then I came down here and I got everything set up. I actually have not managed to even, to even eat yet.
[904.86 --> 914.86]  But you guys know that, uh, you guys know I love you and I'm trying to bring you guys like the best and most awesome live streams that I possibly can.
[914.86 --> 924.86]  I have one challenge here which is that now that, um, now that the way that I'm positioned is a little bit different, I don't know where I'm gonna, you know what, maybe I'll put Twitter on this side tonight.
[924.86 --> 929.86]  I'm breaking the mold here. Things are getting crazy now.
[929.86 --> 934.86]  Okay. Can you guys read that okay? I'm just gonna check the, uh, I'm gonna check the Twitch chat really quick.
[934.86 --> 939.86]  And see if you guys can, uh, can actually see that alright.
[939.86 --> 943.86]  Thanks for the effort. Nice for, okay. Yeah, yeah, you guys saw it. Okay.
[943.86 --> 949.86]  So let's get to some Twitter Q&A. I'm just gonna slide my chair over here which is super awkward the way that I'm doing it here.
[949.86 --> 953.86]  And let's get to it. So 69 new interactions.
[953.86 --> 956.86]  You guys know what that's about.
[956.86 --> 962.86]  Alright, like the quality. Okay, Oliver has a question about video cards.
[962.86 --> 966.86]  Video cards are something I get a ton of questions about.
[966.86 --> 968.86]  And I would love to answer your question, Oliver.
[968.86 --> 974.86]  Should I get a second 6870 or a new 7970? Best price to performance ratio.
[974.86 --> 980.86]  Okay. It is always a challenge to calculate the price to performance ratio of a crossfire setup.
[980.86 --> 989.86]  Because in one game, you might have a situation where the crossfire setup destroys an equivalently priced single card.
[989.86 --> 992.86]  And I think someone's texting me over and over again.
[992.86 --> 994.86]  Oh, Slick says...
[994.86 --> 999.86]  Let's see if it focuses on that. Come on, camera. You can do it.
[999.86 --> 1002.86]  Yeah, whatever. He says, well, you're small.
[1002.86 --> 1007.86]  Because apparently he's sort of upset about how I would call him fat.
[1007.86 --> 1009.86]  But I guess he is watching tonight.
[1009.86 --> 1015.86]  Right. So you'll run into situations where in game X, the crossfire setup destroys the single card.
[1015.86 --> 1019.86]  And in game Y, the crossfire setup doesn't work at all.
[1019.86 --> 1021.86]  And the single card setup is way better.
[1021.86 --> 1030.86]  So it basically comes down to the games you play and looking at it in terms of like, sort of a general rule.
[1030.86 --> 1031.86]  A general rule.
[1031.86 --> 1035.86]  So general rule for me is unless you're talking two high-end cards.
[1035.86 --> 1042.86]  7900 series, 660 Ti and up for the Nvidia side, get a single card.
[1042.86 --> 1046.86]  Do not run crossfire with lower-end cards because it's usually not a great value.
[1046.86 --> 1048.86]  Because when it doesn't work, it's not working.
[1048.86 --> 1053.86]  And when it does work, well, you could have gotten 90% of that performance with the single card solution.
[1053.86 --> 1059.86]  So, yes. Get a 7970. Sell your old 6870. And be happy.
[1059.86 --> 1063.86]  Can't hear you whenever you switch from the camera view to desktop.
[1063.86 --> 1066.86]  My audio cuts out. Okay. Well, I'll figure that out.
[1066.86 --> 1070.86]  Brian. Brian, it's funny you should bring that up.
[1070.86 --> 1074.86]  I actually didn't troll Elric with the Ivy Bridge thing.
[1074.86 --> 1081.86]  He released a video where he received from Linus Tech Tips in the mail this box that was labeled Ivy Bridge.
[1081.86 --> 1082.86]  And this was prior to the embargo.
[1082.86 --> 1088.86]  And then inside, there was like a little model bridge covered with Ivy.
[1088.86 --> 1090.86]  And then he was like, haha, Linus trolled me.
[1090.86 --> 1092.86]  I actually had no involvement in that.
[1092.86 --> 1095.86]  I mean, I don't mind. I don't care. It doesn't matter to me.
[1095.86 --> 1097.86]  Like, it's... I thought it was pretty funny.
[1097.86 --> 1100.86]  But I actually had zero involvement with it.
[1100.86 --> 1107.86]  So, it was just... it was kind of confusing because I had people congratulating me on my awesome prank
[1107.86 --> 1112.86]  before I actually managed to find out what I had pranked.
[1112.86 --> 1118.86]  So, yeah. I don't know. It was confusing. It was confusing.
[1118.86 --> 1121.86]  Good morning. It's 7 in the morning here.
[1121.86 --> 1125.86]  Greetings from Lithuania. Greetings back Lithuania.
[1125.86 --> 1129.86]  I am thrilled that you... that you managed to tune in here.
[1129.86 --> 1133.86]  Joel says, the slow-mo guys use a 10,000 FPS Phantom Flex.
[1133.86 --> 1136.86]  Okay. It's possible I was looking at one of their older videos.
[1136.86 --> 1142.86]  I was looking at the stomach punch one where they say it was captured at 2,500 FPS.
[1142.86 --> 1145.86]  Maybe it's possible that their camera goes higher than that,
[1145.86 --> 1150.86]  but they capture it at that frame rate for better quality or whatever else the case may be.
[1150.86 --> 1153.86]  Either way, I know it's a very, very expensive camera.
[1153.86 --> 1156.86]  But either way, I'm excited about what we can do with the FS700.
[1156.86 --> 1163.86]  Because I'm pretty impressed with Slick's impact on the table there and how good that looked.
[1163.86 --> 1166.86]  Someone wanted me to call out that Slick is really sexy.
[1166.86 --> 1169.86]  So, for the sake of Slick and his largeness,
[1169.86 --> 1172.86]  apparently one of our viewers also thinks he's sexy.
[1172.86 --> 1174.86]  So, good job Slick.
[1176.86 --> 1180.86]  Alright. Jose Perez. Jose Perez?
[1180.86 --> 1189.86]  HD capture card or RAID 0 SSDs using FRAPs for recording and editing gameplay and short films.
[1189.86 --> 1191.86]  Now, it depends what you mean by short films.
[1191.86 --> 1193.86]  Because if short films...
[1193.86 --> 1196.86]  Okay, you probably mean like Gary's Mod short films.
[1196.86 --> 1197.86]  Okay.
[1197.86 --> 1199.86]  So, let's assume you're talking gameplay capture.
[1199.86 --> 1200.86]  This is a cool product.
[1200.86 --> 1202.86]  The one that I have behind me here.
[1202.86 --> 1205.86]  I'm just going to run and grab the package.
[1205.86 --> 1207.86]  This is a very cool product for a couple of reasons.
[1207.86 --> 1217.86]  So, number one is that because of the fact that it's doing H.264 encoding on the fly, you have much smaller file sizes.
[1217.86 --> 1227.86]  Okay. So, smaller file sizes are beneficial because with a smaller file size, you don't need like a dual SSD RAID 0 in order to actually capture 1080p footage.
[1227.86 --> 1234.86]  Okay. The other cool thing about the on the fly encoding is that you can play at 1080p and then you can actually stream...
[1234.86 --> 1242.86]  Like what you actually capture or stream can be at 720p because it's doing that conversion in real time.
[1242.86 --> 1243.86]  So, that's really cool.
[1243.86 --> 1258.86]  However, as with any capture card, my experience with this one has been fraught with difficulties and it hasn't been the easiest experience in the world to figure out how to get it going properly.
[1258.86 --> 1261.86]  So, the answer is...
[1261.86 --> 1262.86]  I don't know.
[1262.86 --> 1266.86]  Fraps is a great solution in that it's flexible.
[1266.86 --> 1268.86]  You can easily move it around from machine to machine.
[1268.86 --> 1270.86]  It doesn't require any kind of dedicated hardware.
[1270.86 --> 1271.86]  The software is very mature.
[1271.86 --> 1272.86]  It's very awesome.
[1272.86 --> 1278.86]  But, the challenge is again, you need that beefy PC.
[1278.86 --> 1280.86]  Also, it's very CPU intensive.
[1280.86 --> 1281.86]  Right.
[1281.86 --> 1291.86]  Benefit number three of using something like that Avramedia Live Gamer HD capture card is that it's not going to affect your game performance.
[1291.86 --> 1298.86]  So, you can run your PC at exactly the same performance as if you weren't recording but you are recording.
[1298.86 --> 1299.86]  It offloads everything.
[1299.86 --> 1300.86]  So, that's really cool as well.
[1300.86 --> 1305.86]  So, if you're techy enough, if you think you can handle it, get the Live Gamer HD.
[1305.86 --> 1308.86]  Be done with it because you're going to be able to run at a higher FPS.
[1308.86 --> 1312.86]  You're going to not have to worry about a really high-end storage system.
[1312.86 --> 1315.86]  And, yeah, I think that's going to be a better solution for you.
[1315.86 --> 1316.86]  However, it's a $200 investment.
[1316.86 --> 1317.86]  Oh, yeah, FRAPS is free.
[1317.86 --> 1324.86]  But, then again, buying two SSDs for FRAPS is another $200 investment by the time you have any decent capacity SSDs.
[1324.86 --> 1334.86]  Logan asks, Linus, I was designing a computer and I wondered what is the difference between a 3770K, a 3770, and a 3770S?
[1334.86 --> 1337.86]  If I recall correctly, and guys, please correct me.
[1337.86 --> 1339.86]  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
[1339.86 --> 1342.86]  The 3770S should be a low power variant.
[1342.86 --> 1351.86]  The 3770 is a slightly overclockable 3770 in that you can go, I think it's a few steps above the maximum turbo multiplier.
[1351.86 --> 1353.86]  You can still get pretty decent clock speeds out of it.
[1353.86 --> 1356.86]  I've got a 3770 that I was playing around with and I was just kind of like, oh, okay.
[1356.86 --> 1363.86]  Well, you can turn the QPI up to kind of 105-ish and then that gives you some additional couple hundred megahertz.
[1363.86 --> 1366.86]  And then plus, you can turn the multipliers up pretty high.
[1366.86 --> 1376.86]  I mean, by the time you sort of max out how high you can turn it up, you're getting to the point where you're starting to have to feed it more voltage than you'd probably like anyway.
[1376.86 --> 1381.86]  So 3770 is not a bad solution, but the K will go a little bit further.
[1381.86 --> 1382.86]  Alright, guys?
[1382.86 --> 1383.86]  Something I wanted to clarify.
[1383.86 --> 1385.86]  I made a mistake on the live stream last week.
[1385.86 --> 1392.86]  Intel's Haswell CPUs are coming for LGA 1150, not 1155.
[1392.86 --> 1397.86]  So I get a lot of questions about socket 2011 versus socket 1155.
[1397.86 --> 1401.86]  So the premium enthusiast socket versus the mainstream socket for Intel.
[1401.86 --> 1403.86]  And remember, there's a third socket on that.
[1403.86 --> 1412.86]  Well, okay, 2011 is also a server socket, but completely different platform in terms of the motherboard and the CPUs for the server side.
[1412.86 --> 1414.86]  So we're talking consumer and workstation.
[1414.86 --> 1416.86]  So 2011 advantages.
[1416.86 --> 1417.86]  More than four cores.
[1417.86 --> 1419.86]  And that doesn't mean just six cores.
[1419.86 --> 1429.86]  We've got six cores and eight cores now, but Intel has already said that when Ivy Bridge E comes, we're going to have 10 to 12 cores in a single socket.
[1429.86 --> 1436.86]  High performance Ivy Bridge cores, which is like getting my geek on as far as 2011 goes.
[1436.86 --> 1441.86]  Intel has also come out and said LGA 1155 is never getting more than four cores.
[1441.86 --> 1448.86]  Now, I don't know how many cores LGA 1150 is going to get, but I'm falling asleep.
[1448.86 --> 1449.86]  Take off your shirt.
[1449.86 --> 1450.86]  All right.
[1450.86 --> 1451.86]  All right.
[1451.86 --> 1452.86]  Well, someone asked for it.
[1452.86 --> 1455.86]  So I'm getting, no, I'm not really going to do that.
[1455.86 --> 1458.86]  So LGA 1150, I don't know how many cores it's going to get.
[1458.86 --> 1460.86]  It will get the Haswell architecture.
[1460.86 --> 1462.86]  1155 is a dead end now.
[1462.86 --> 1468.86]  You will never get anything faster than an Ivy Bridge CPU with four cores and hyperthreading.
[1468.86 --> 1469.86]  So which one should you get?
[1469.86 --> 1470.86]  Okay.
[1470.86 --> 1472.86]  So 2011, you got more memory capacity.
[1472.86 --> 1473.86]  You got more memory bandwidth.
[1473.86 --> 1483.86]  You have more PCIe lanes, although I think I've covered in depth enough times that more PCIe lanes actually doesn't make much difference to gaming performance, especially with a two way card configuration.
[1483.86 --> 1498.86]  And then on LGA 1155, you've got this dead end platform, but the performance is actually in gaming better than 2011 because 2011 is still running the Sandy Bridge architecture and we're now on Ivy Bridge on LGA 1155.
[1498.86 --> 1501.86]  So if you're not planning to upgrade your CPU and let's face it guys.
[1501.86 --> 1502.86]  Okay.
[1502.86 --> 1503.86]  Okay.
[1503.86 --> 1504.86]  Okay.
[1504.86 --> 1505.86]  We're going to do a quick poll.
[1505.86 --> 1506.86]  Poll here.
[1506.86 --> 1507.86]  So you can respond in Twitch.
[1507.86 --> 1508.86]  You can respond in Twitter.
[1508.86 --> 1509.86]  I'm going to go ahead.
[1509.86 --> 1512.86]  I'm going to give you guys sort of like 30 seconds to reply to this poll.
[1512.86 --> 1528.86]  Have you ever after a year with a computer, whether it's a laptop, whether it's a desktop, bought a new CPU based on a new architecture and then dropped it in as a replacement to your existing one?
[1528.86 --> 1532.86]  And in fact, I don't want you guys to say how, if you ever, I want you to say how many times you've done it.
[1532.86 --> 1536.86]  If you've never done it, just type zero or, or, or a zero.
[1536.86 --> 1539.86]  And if you've ever done it, then, then type how many times you've actually done it.
[1539.86 --> 1543.86]  Cause I think, I think I did it once.
[1543.86 --> 1548.86]  I think one time I went on socket 754.
[1548.86 --> 1557.86]  I went from a 3000 plus to a 3500 plus because I got like a fantastic deal or something stupid like that.
[1557.86 --> 1560.86]  I think that's the only time I ever did it.
[1560.86 --> 1562.86]  And the results are piling in.
[1562.86 --> 1565.86]  I'm going to go ahead and move Twitch over here so you guys can kind of see it.
[1565.86 --> 1568.86]  And then we'll do a Twitter, Twitter result later.
[1568.86 --> 1573.86]  So does it matter that LG 1155 doesn't have an upgrade platform?
[1573.86 --> 1574.86]  I don't think so.
[1574.86 --> 1578.86]  Because you can always sell your 1155 kit.
[1578.86 --> 1581.86]  So your motherboard, your CPU, it'll still perform pretty good.
[1581.86 --> 1584.86]  Like we're seeing pretty small generational performance improvements.
[1584.86 --> 1585.86]  Yeah.
[1585.86 --> 1588.86]  So lots of zeros, ones, twos, lots of zeros.
[1588.86 --> 1593.86]  So you can always sell it and then buy a new one and you'll probably take a 50 to a 100 dollar hit.
[1593.86 --> 1603.86]  Which is pretty close to the 50 dollar hit that you'd take by upgrading your existing 2011 CPU or even a 100 dollar hit or whatever you take.
[1603.86 --> 1611.86]  Like the loss you take selling and rebuying hardware, I really don't think is that different however you go about it.
[1611.86 --> 1616.86]  So I'm not really sold on sockets and platforms as upgrade potential.
[1616.86 --> 1619.86]  I mean AMD's done a good job of it.
[1619.86 --> 1629.86]  So AM3 is cool because you can install an 1100T, an FX8150 and an FX8350 in the same board.
[1629.86 --> 1631.86]  Which is, that's pretty cool.
[1631.86 --> 1634.86]  It's three generational changes.
[1634.86 --> 1641.86]  So they went from this socket having nothing higher end than a 6 core to all of a sudden having an 8 core and then an 8 core with a new architecture.
[1641.86 --> 1651.86]  So, um, so yeah, I mean that's cool but I think most people just haven't really, haven't really sort of done that.
[1651.86 --> 1654.86]  So let's have a look at what the Twitter, what the Twitter responses were.
[1654.86 --> 1655.86]  I've done it.
[1655.86 --> 1656.86]  One inch, two.
[1656.86 --> 1658.86]  Okay, I have no idea what that means.
[1658.86 --> 1659.86]  Never.
[1659.86 --> 1660.86]  Always upgrade to a new architecture.
[1660.86 --> 1661.86]  Whole new platform.
[1661.86 --> 1670.86]  Because here's another thing to consider is when the new CPU comes out, often the aging platform that is compatible with it isn't really a perfect choice.
[1670.86 --> 1674.86]  Because, okay, let's look at Ivy Bridge for example.
[1674.86 --> 1678.86]  Okay, so Z68 motherboards have support for Ivy Bridge CPUs.
[1678.86 --> 1679.86]  Mostly.
[1679.86 --> 1682.86]  I found one that doesn't and I'm like super mad about it because I have one of these boards.
[1682.86 --> 1684.86]  And I'm like, what do you mean you didn't upgrade it for Ivy Bridge?
[1684.86 --> 1685.86]  Anyway, sorry, an aside.
[1685.86 --> 1696.86]  But, um, they're compatible but you don't get the benefit of, if I recall correctly, Virtue MVP, which I'm not entirely sold on anyway, but whatever.
[1696.86 --> 1697.86]  Okay, so you don't get the benefit.
[1697.86 --> 1705.86]  You don't get the benefit of, um, PCI Express 3.0, which again, I don't, I'm not sure if I really care that much about anyway.
[1705.86 --> 1714.86]  But, the point is if you want to get the most out of that new CPU you bought, you're probably better off just buying a new motherboard to go with it anyway.
[1714.86 --> 1725.86]  Because you're going to want, by that time, you're going to want your dual thunderbolt output and you're going to want your all USB 3 implementation instead of having USB 2 mixed in there.
[1725.86 --> 1729.86]  There's going to be some kind of other cool crazy thing that is going to be good.
[1729.86 --> 1741.86]  Like, the new motherboards are going to have better onboard sound, better, like, who knows, maybe 10 gigabit LAN by the time, you know, we're two years down the road and it's time to upgrade from an Ivy Bridge, from an Ivy Bridge platform.
[1741.86 --> 1744.86]  So, so that's where we're at with all of this.
[1744.86 --> 1749.86]  Uh, right, so let's, you know, let's just go through and do some sort of shout outs for people here.
[1749.86 --> 1751.86]  Am I excited about the upcoming FX80 350?
[1751.86 --> 1754.86]  I'm always excited about new CPUs and video cards.
[1754.86 --> 1756.86]  CPUs, video cards, and SSDs.
[1756.86 --> 1759.86]  Those are my favorite things to like, get excited about.
[1759.86 --> 1761.86]  Uh, zero, zero.
[1761.86 --> 1763.86]  Yes, once, says Matthew.
[1763.86 --> 1765.86]  Zero, zero, zero.
[1765.86 --> 1767.86]  Only once, one.
[1767.86 --> 1769.86]  How are you doing tonight?
[1769.86 --> 1772.86]  My question, should I get rid of my dedicated PhysX card?
[1772.86 --> 1774.86]  Yes, sell your 570.
[1774.86 --> 1778.86]  Your 660Ti can handle the PhysX on its own, Anders.
[1778.86 --> 1781.86]  I went to the elementary school with a guy named Anders.
[1781.86 --> 1784.86]  Anders, um, who's his last name?
[1784.86 --> 1785.86]  I don't remember.
[1785.86 --> 1786.86]  It doesn't really matter.
[1786.86 --> 1789.86]  You said that you could film Hertz and refresh rates of monitors with a new cam.
[1789.86 --> 1790.86]  I think that would be an awesome idea.
[1790.86 --> 1791.86]  Thank you, Alexander.
[1791.86 --> 1793.86]  We are not planning to film.
[1793.86 --> 1794.86]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[1794.86 --> 1801.86]  So, I want to talk a little bit about one of the plans I have for this new camera that is capable of filming at 960 FPS.
[1801.86 --> 1813.86]  What I want to do is I want to take two displays, a CRT and an LCD, and then I want to clone the display out from a gaming PC.
[1813.86 --> 1816.86]  And then we put a microphone right next to the mouse.
[1816.86 --> 1817.86]  So, we got our mouse here.
[1817.86 --> 1819.86]  We put a microphone right next to it.
[1819.86 --> 1831.86]  And then what we do is we hit the mouse with a hard object so that we can use the sound recording as an indicator of when we sent the signal to the LCDs.
[1831.86 --> 1832.86]  And it won't be exact.
[1832.86 --> 1833.86]  Come on, guys.
[1833.86 --> 1840.86]  But we can then use the CRT to see the instant response because CRTs don't have input lag.
[1840.86 --> 1851.86]  Then we can see the LCD to see how many more frames, because we can throw it in a video editor and actually measure frame by frame how many more frames it takes for the LCD to react.
[1851.86 --> 1856.86]  Then we can go multiply how many frames it is by however many, whatever.
[1856.86 --> 1857.86]  We'll do the math.
[1857.86 --> 1860.86]  I can't do it in my head right now, but I can do it on paper.
[1860.86 --> 1870.86]  So, we'll go, okay, so if it was 5 frames and it's 960 frames per second, then we can go, okay, so it's 5 960th of a second of input lag compared to CRT.
[1870.86 --> 1871.86]  Which is really, really cool.
[1871.86 --> 1872.86]  Really exciting.
[1872.86 --> 1880.86]  So, we'll be able to tell you guys definitively if an LCD is awesome for gaming and has input lag or if it doesn't have input lag.
[1880.86 --> 1884.86]  And whoever thinks I'm streaming with a webcam, you weren't on time tonight.
[1884.86 --> 1886.86]  Mind you, I wasn't on time tonight.
[1886.86 --> 1890.86]  But, yes, it is an $8,500 camera.
[1890.86 --> 1895.86]  It is not a webcam tonight with an all new audio setup and everything.
[1895.86 --> 1898.86]  So, Madness says stupid idea, Linus.
[1898.86 --> 1899.86]  Well, too bad.
[1899.86 --> 1900.86]  We're going to try it and we're going to see if it works.
[1900.86 --> 1902.86]  And if it does, then the joke's on you.
[1902.86 --> 1904.86]  And now he says joke.
[1904.86 --> 1906.86]  Okay, so let's read some more Twitter here, guys.
[1906.86 --> 1907.86]  Greetings from Egypt.
[1907.86 --> 1909.86]  It's 6 30 AM.
[1909.86 --> 1910.86]  You know what?
[1910.86 --> 1911.86]  This?
[1911.86 --> 1913.86]  This is a cookie jar.
[1913.86 --> 1916.86]  And this is me taking out a cookie.
[1916.86 --> 1920.86]  Or, well, actually it's one of those sweet and sour sauce containers from Microsoft.
[1920.86 --> 1921.86]  But, whatever.
[1921.86 --> 1926.86]  You get an internet cookie for tuning in at 6 30 AM.
[1926.86 --> 1928.86]  Because you are amazing.
[1928.86 --> 1930.86]  6 30 in the morning.
[1930.86 --> 1931.86]  You're amazing.
[1931.86 --> 1932.86]  Okay?
[1932.86 --> 1934.86]  I'm doing some upgrades early next year.
[1934.86 --> 1939.86]  Should I get a second 7970 or sell my current one and upgrade to an 8970 if it's out by then?
[1939.86 --> 1941.86]  I can't speculate on upcoming products.
[1941.86 --> 1944.86]  So, I don't know how an 8970 is going to perform.
[1944.86 --> 1946.86]  I don't know how much it's going to cost.
[1946.86 --> 1948.86]  So, I can advise you on that.
[1948.86 --> 1952.86]  If you're not happy with your 7970 now, maybe try another one.
[1952.86 --> 1954.86]  If you are happy with it, then hold off.
[1954.86 --> 1957.86]  I mean, that's all I can really say when people ask me, is it time to upgrade?
[1957.86 --> 1959.86]  And I just say, look, are you happy with your system?
[1959.86 --> 1961.86]  Are you not happy with your system?
[1961.86 --> 1963.86]  Oh, heavy, heavy, heavy.
[1963.86 --> 1964.86]  Okay, heavy.
[1964.86 --> 1966.86]  We have a lecture to give you.
[1966.86 --> 1971.86]  Heavy HDX says, I have a Core 2 Quad and 4GB of DDR2.
[1971.86 --> 1976.86]  What do you think about buying a DDR3 socket 775 board and putting 8GB of RAM in it?
[1976.86 --> 1982.86]  Heavy, LGA 775 processors were not even remotely optimized for DDR3.
[1982.86 --> 1991.86]  In fact, since LGA 775, we haven't seen a significant performance increase on the Intel side of things
[1991.86 --> 1994.86]  from increasing RAM speed or increasing RAM bandwidth.
[1994.86 --> 2003.86]  Even LGA 1366 and 2011 have almost no benefit in many applications, in real world applications,
[2003.86 --> 2008.86]  from going from dual channel memory, you can install dual channel memory, to triple, to quadruple.
[2008.86 --> 2012.86]  When we went from DDR2 to DDR3, we also added an integrated memory.
[2012.86 --> 2019.86]  I mean, even the LGA 775 processors, they saw almost zero performance impact going from DDR2 to DDR3.
[2019.86 --> 2027.86]  Remember, DDR3, even more dramatically than what DDR2 did, added a phenomenal amount of latency to the memory interface.
[2027.86 --> 2032.86]  Yes, it's more bandwidth, but the latency is higher, so it's almost a trade-off.
[2032.86 --> 2038.86]  Do not do it unless it's super cheap, unless someone gave you a DDR3 board.
[2038.86 --> 2049.86]  I mean, DDR3 is cheap, so the advantage is if you could find a DDR3 board for like 50 bucks, then the difference in price between buying four more gigs of DDR2 versus eight gigs of DDR3,
[2049.86 --> 2054.86]  I mean, I don't know, you do the math, but that might be a way to, uh, that might be a way to sort of justify it.
[2054.86 --> 2057.86]  But you're not going to see a performance increase unless you need more RAM.
[2057.86 --> 2061.86]  I have people commenting on my shirt. This is like my favorite shirt ever. I actually have two of them.
[2061.86 --> 2067.86]  So I got this at a badminton tournament. So it doesn't say, everyday I'm shufflin', it says, everyday I'm shuttlin'.
[2067.86 --> 2074.86]  And see, he has badminton birdies for feet, and then he has a badminton racket for his, uh, for his hand there.
[2074.86 --> 2081.86]  So, everyday I'm shuttlin', and I actually have two of them, and I, uh, I love this shirt, and I am not taking it off again,
[2081.86 --> 2086.86]  because I, I, I think you guys saw enough of my nipples earlier in this livestream.
[2086.86 --> 2094.86]  Nathan asks, which would you pick? The new Samsung 9 Series 27-inch PLS or the new ASUS 27-inch PLS?
[2094.86 --> 2098.86]  You know what? I don't have experience with the new Samsung 27-inch.
[2098.86 --> 2105.86]  Or do I? Yes, I do! That's the one with the full glass front panel. I just wish it was touch screen.
[2105.86 --> 2116.86]  You know what? For the difference in price, I'm gonna go with the ASUS. That's the P, uh, PB27 something Q or something like that.
[2116.86 --> 2123.86]  It's amazing. I love that monitor. And because it doesn't have a glossy screen, it has a matte screen, PLS panel,
[2123.86 --> 2131.86]  very little input lag, motion blur, I couldn't feel it, which is sort of the only subjective way I have of measuring it now.
[2131.86 --> 2137.86]  I love that ASUS monitor. It's outstanding. So go with the ASUS one. It's great.
[2137.86 --> 2143.86]  Please Linus, DXTORY is way better than Fraps. The difference from recording is like 1 FPS.
[2143.86 --> 2148.86]  Okay, I haven't validated this. I don't know, but Victor says it. So there you go.
[2148.86 --> 2152.86]  Hi again. Would you recommend the Corsair SP2500s for Music and Gaming?
[2152.86 --> 2160.86]  Yes, I am using Corsair SP2500s. I actually had an Onkyo receiver, and then I had a couple of very premium capped speakers
[2160.86 --> 2167.86]  that I was using for my audio setup on my gaming machine before. And, uh, and I was so impressed with the Corsairs
[2167.86 --> 2174.86]  that I actually didn't really notice that much of a difference when I moved my Onkyo setup downstairs to where my TV is,
[2174.86 --> 2180.86]  and I took the caffs, and then I, and I used the Corsairs on my, on my main machine. So, awesome.
[2180.86 --> 2187.86]  I'm super impressed with the 2500s. They actually, like, I, I wish more people bought them because, as you guys know, I'm,
[2187.86 --> 2193.86]  I'm not like a complete audio nerd. I'm not into like changing the, you know, the op amps on my sound cards,
[2193.86 --> 2199.86]  and I don't, I don't get into like the $500 headphones, and I have like six pairs of them depending on what kind of music I'm listening to.
[2199.86 --> 2210.86]  I'm not that sophisticated, but I do believe in reasonable quality audio, and onboard sucks, and 99% of PC speakers sucks, you know.
[2210.86 --> 2222.86]  If anyone here who ever heard Monsoon MM2000s, like, raise your hand. I bought the last set of MM2000s. These were gorgeous.
[2222.86 --> 2232.86]  Flat panel speakers. They were about this thin. It was a 4.1 setup, and I returned them to the store for Logitech Z680s.
[2232.86 --> 2238.86]  And it was like the saddest thing ever. So get this, get this. I returned them to the store, and they were super reluctant about it,
[2238.86 --> 2247.86]  because they were the last ones they had. Yeah! BPTES says, I have MM2000s. You have them from 1999. They're amazing. Yes, they are.
[2247.86 --> 2254.86]  Okay, so I returned them to the store, and I bought Z680s. I regretted it so much. They were so boomy. The bass was so ugly.
[2254.86 --> 2266.86]  The flat panel sounds so good. And I, uh, I tried to return the Z680s. I bought them because they were digital, and they were 5.1, and I was, I...
[2266.86 --> 2272.86]  I bought into the hype, you guys. I bought into the hype. Everyone was a noob at some point. I was a noob back then.
[2272.86 --> 2278.86]  And when I went back to the store that I bought the Monsoons at, London Drugs, actually, I went back there, and they were like,
[2278.86 --> 2285.86]  Oh, we don't... I tried to buy them again. I wanted to buy them back, because what bothered me about them is they had a bit of a hiss from them, and they were 4.1.
[2285.86 --> 2293.86]  Anyway, they had thrown them away, because Monsoon had gone out of business. I had no way to obtain these speakers ever again.
[2293.86 --> 2299.86]  And they had thrown them in a dumpster after I returned them, because of...
[2299.86 --> 2303.86]  Like, they just didn't have anything to do with them. And I was like, really?
[2303.86 --> 2312.86]  So then I was stuck with the Z680s. Until then, I ended up blowing just a ton of money on my Clips ProMedia Ultra 5.1s.
[2312.86 --> 2320.86]  Those were awesome speakers. They were the best PC speakers. And I say that without...
[2320.86 --> 2326.86]  Really, this is not open for debate. Not open for debate. The Clips ProMedia Ultra 5.1s were the best speakers.
[2326.86 --> 2334.86]  Mine did not have the subwoofer issue. So mine ran 24-7 for 3 plus years, and I got a lot of use out of them.
[2334.86 --> 2344.86]  And I actually, just so that I would know, so that I would know for sure, I actually bought some Creative Gigawerts S700s.
[2344.86 --> 2349.86]  And I auditioned them side by side, because I wanted to know I had the best possible experience.
[2349.86 --> 2355.86]  And you know what? The Gigawerts satellites were actually outstanding, and maybe a little bit of an Eclipse,
[2355.86 --> 2361.86]  but the Klipsch sub was just, for 600 bucks, it was untouchable. This kit was untouchable.
[2361.86 --> 2365.86]  And then it wasn't until I had to get rid of my Klipsch's, long story.
[2365.86 --> 2370.86]  But then I upgraded to my Onkyo's, and now I'm back to the Corsairs. The Corsairs are great.
[2370.86 --> 2375.86]  And I became more of a headphone guy, because I moved in with... This is kind of embarrassing.
[2375.86 --> 2383.86]  But I lived with my wife's parents for like three years. So I moved into their house, which meant I couldn't crank my Klipsch's,
[2383.86 --> 2390.86]  or anything that I had set up. So I ended up becoming a headphone guy, and then I got my Sennheiser HD 555s,
[2390.86 --> 2398.86]  and then I moved on to my current favorite headphone set. And again, like I said, I don't really get into the $500 stuff,
[2398.86 --> 2406.86]  but these are the SteelSeries 7H's. These are hands down, like, I would say, five to ten times better in terms of audio quality
[2406.86 --> 2412.86]  than any gaming headset. I'm going to let that sink in for a moment.
[2412.86 --> 2414.86]  And I'm going to have people saying,
[2414.86 --> 2421.86]  what about the 7.1 Sycos, or 5.1s, or whatever they are. You know what? Surround headphones are not a good experience,
[2421.86 --> 2425.86]  because you're better off with bigger drivers than lots of little tinny ones.
[2425.86 --> 2427.86]  Okay? So forget about your surround headphones.
[2427.86 --> 2435.86]  And, Linus, what about the Carkarius, or the this, or the that, or the Siberia V2?
[2435.86 --> 2440.86]  Where do people keep hearing that Siberia V2s are good headphones?
[2440.86 --> 2444.86]  Where is this misinformation coming from? Okay, we're going back to Twitter here.
[2444.86 --> 2452.86]  I want you guys to explain to me, if you have heard that Siberia V2s are good headphones, where you heard that from.
[2452.86 --> 2459.86]  Great headset, comfortable, mics great, retractable mic is a great feature, they look fantastic,
[2459.86 --> 2469.86]  but the sound quality is terrible. It's worth the extra, I think it's only an extra 20, 30 bucks to get the 7Hs.
[2469.86 --> 2473.86]  They're a little heavier, they're not as comfortable, they don't have as big earpieces,
[2473.86 --> 2477.86]  they have that fragile micro USB thing going on here, but if you're careful with it, mine are fine,
[2477.86 --> 2483.86]  I've been using them for over two years now, but the sound quality is night and day.
[2483.86 --> 2488.86]  It is so much better. So we're going to the Twitter boards.
[2488.86 --> 2492.86]  Oh, come on guys, this isn't even related to what I asked.
[2492.86 --> 2497.86]  At Linus Tech on Twitter. You guys aren't even answering my questions.
[2497.86 --> 2500.86]  Okay, we're going to go back to the Siberias, we're going to go back to the Siberias later.
[2500.86 --> 2505.86]  So 7H are awesome, and then the other great solution is getting something like a Sennheiser 555s,
[2505.86 --> 2513.86]  and people keep telling me that there's a couple of other brands, I can't remember for the life of me right now.
[2513.86 --> 2522.86]  But, no, PC350, do not like PC350. I'm sorry. My wife loves the PC350s. I am not sold on PC350 at all.
[2522.86 --> 2525.86]  I haven't heard the 360s. Apparently they're a lot better.
[2525.86 --> 2527.86]  But, um...
[2527.86 --> 2531.86]  Aww, Human Plow is leaving! Bye, I will finish this on YouTube.
[2531.86 --> 2536.86]  I'm actually very sorry to hear that. I love it when you guys tune in live, because it's much more interactive,
[2536.86 --> 2539.86]  and it puffs up my ego that you guys tune in.
[2539.86 --> 2541.86]  So, uh...
[2541.86 --> 2547.86]  Yeah, I've... Oh yeah, Audio Technica. Thank you. That's the brand that people keep telling me is great.
[2547.86 --> 2550.86]  I have no experience with them though, so I don't really know what to tell you guys.
[2550.86 --> 2553.86]  But, uh, yeah, great. The other solution is getting a pair of headphones,
[2553.86 --> 2559.86]  and then getting like a desktop microphone, or like a clip-on microphone that you can put on your shirt or whatever else.
[2559.86 --> 2561.86]  So that's, uh, that's all good.
[2561.86 --> 2566.86]  Alright! So what about Astros? Okay, they are good for reasons other than the sound.
[2566.86 --> 2572.86]  Avery, you are correct. They are comfortable. The mic is great, and they're a good value. They're very light.
[2572.86 --> 2575.86]  But, I'm all about sound quality, personally.
[2577.86 --> 2581.86]  Uh, you know what? I'm not sold on the G600. I haven't played around with it enough,
[2581.86 --> 2583.86]  but it feels a little laggy on my 30-inch.
[2583.86 --> 2589.86]  Really, the test of a mouse for me, and this could be just the weirdest thing ever,
[2589.86 --> 2593.86]  but I find the higher resolution panel I'm using it on,
[2593.86 --> 2597.86]  the more noticeable any kind of lagginess or inaccuracy is.
[2597.86 --> 2603.86]  And I love the G9X. I am like a Logitech guy when it comes to peripherals.
[2603.86 --> 2607.86]  Here's my G15 Gen 1. Gen 1, you guys!
[2607.86 --> 2611.86]  G15 Gen 1 was a beast keyboard. I bought three,
[2611.86 --> 2614.86]  because I never wanted to run out of Gen 1 G15s.
[2614.86 --> 2617.86]  I still use them for like secondary applications and all that.
[2617.86 --> 2620.86]  But I'm not that sold on the G600 yet. Give me more time.
[2620.86 --> 2623.86]  Okay, give me more time, and I will play around with it some more.
[2623.86 --> 2626.86]  And I will come back with some kind of commentary on it. Okay, guys?
[2627.86 --> 2630.86]  Uh, can you give me any stream tips on this build?
[2630.86 --> 2633.86]  You know what, Brendan? I'm sorry, I can't look at builds right now,
[2633.86 --> 2635.86]  just because everyone has to watch.
[2635.86 --> 2638.86]  John from Twitch praised the Siberia V2s.
[2638.86 --> 2641.86]  I hope John's tuned in tonight. John, you're wrong.
[2641.86 --> 2644.86]  And Siberia V2s and Psychos are terrible.
[2644.86 --> 2646.86]  So, no.
[2646.86 --> 2649.86]  Friend who owned a pair hated the sound quality.
[2649.86 --> 2652.86]  Yeah, I have a question. Are the fans on the 650D good,
[2652.86 --> 2654.86]  or should I replace them? No, they're not good.
[2654.86 --> 2656.86]  They're just stock case fans.
[2656.86 --> 2657.86]  I love Noctua fans.
[2657.86 --> 2660.86]  Corsair even has better higher-end fans these days.
[2660.86 --> 2663.86]  So, yes, there's lots of better solutions out there.
[2663.86 --> 2666.86]  They're horrible. I use them now. The mic sucks.
[2666.86 --> 2669.86]  You know what? There's probably something wrong with your sound setup other than that,
[2669.86 --> 2671.86]  because the Siberia V2s do have a good mic.
[2671.86 --> 2673.86]  I guarantee it.
[2673.86 --> 2675.86]  If you have a good sound card, you have a good...
[2675.86 --> 2678.86]  Oh, Ask Dr. Stupid.
[2678.86 --> 2681.86]  There's some sort of something fitting for you guys.
[2681.86 --> 2685.86]  Ask Dr. Stupid says something about Beats being the best headphones.
[2685.86 --> 2687.86]  He's just trolling whoever said that.
[2687.86 --> 2690.86]  X-Ray says, can you make a motorcycle video?
[2690.86 --> 2693.86]  I made a motorcycle video once. I did an unboxing of my motorcycle.
[2693.86 --> 2697.86]  So, that was a long time ago. That was back when I got it.
[2697.86 --> 2700.86]  Wow, we've got quite a turnout tonight.
[2700.86 --> 2704.86]  In spite of the errors earlier on in the stream, we've got 1,700 people watching.
[2704.86 --> 2709.86]  So, let's take a minute here guys and just thank you so much for tuning into the stream.
[2709.86 --> 2711.86]  This is outstanding.
[2711.86 --> 2714.86]  You guys are actually just the best.
[2714.86 --> 2718.86]  And you know what else I noticed?
[2718.86 --> 2724.86]  Ever since I uploaded that, you know, thank you for 200,000 subscribers, my subscriber rate has actually gone like this.
[2724.86 --> 2730.86]  So, you guys are... I don't know what you guys are doing, but you're spreading the word and you're like, you know, bringing people into the channel.
[2730.86 --> 2735.86]  So, yep. It's awesome. Everything is awesome.
[2735.86 --> 2736.86]  So, you guys are amazing.
[2736.86 --> 2744.86]  I know I'm behind all my tweets and I'm sorry, but you know, actually there's been a lot of stuff going on lately and things are crazy.
[2744.86 --> 2747.86]  Jose says, does NCIX sell that capture card?
[2747.86 --> 2752.86]  Yes, NCIX does sell that capture card. It's the Live Gamer HD.
[2752.86 --> 2757.86]  Foxington Fox, what is my server hardware specs? I've done videos about that.
[2757.86 --> 2764.86]  So, if you search for a minus personal server, you should be able to come up with some of the videos I've done while...
[2764.86 --> 2767.86]  About my server.
[2767.86 --> 2773.86]  Stevie! Not being able to sleep and catching the live stream.
[2773.86 --> 2776.86]  Thank you for tuning in, Stevie. That is amazing.
[2776.86 --> 2780.86]  6 a.m. and he's still awake watching the live stream.
[2780.86 --> 2784.86]  And like I said, I have like the best followers. You guys are amazing.
[2784.86 --> 2788.86]  Because I know, I know that actually for probably here...
[2788.86 --> 2790.86]  We're gonna lose Twitter for a second here.
[2790.86 --> 2796.86]  I know that for probably 90% of you guys, this time slot is terrible.
[2796.86 --> 2798.86]  But there's really nothing I can do about it.
[2798.86 --> 2801.86]  My wife wants me on the weekends, which I understand.
[2801.86 --> 2807.86]  And then I work 9 to 5, well, more like, you know, sort of 9.30, 10 to like 7 or 8.
[2807.86 --> 2810.86]  Which means I don't get home until this.
[2810.86 --> 2817.86]  However, sometime in the future, I will find a way to switch to like an afternoon my time.
[2817.86 --> 2822.86]  Because late night my time means that on the East Coast of North America, you guys are screwed.
[2822.86 --> 2826.86]  Because by the time I finish my live stream, it's like 1.30. Sorry guys.
[2826.86 --> 2828.86]  Europe! You guys are screwed.
[2828.86 --> 2831.86]  Because you're just waking up. And you don't want to get up at 6.
[2831.86 --> 2834.86]  I mean, you know, all you guys who are tuned in, you guys are awesome.
[2834.86 --> 2837.86]  But I know you don't want to get up at 6 to tune into the live stream.
[2837.86 --> 2839.86]  The only ones who it works for...
[2839.86 --> 2841.86]  Again, yeah, Tom Cam here...
[2841.86 --> 2843.86]  Oh, sorry, wrong one.
[2843.86 --> 2845.86]  Tom Cam here in the Twitch chat says,
[2845.86 --> 2847.86]  Yeah, well it's 3.58 in Melbourne.
[2847.86 --> 2853.86]  Yeah, I was just going to say, the one demographic that this works for is the viewers in Australia.
[2853.86 --> 2856.86]  And then I don't think I have a ton of viewers in Asia.
[2856.86 --> 2860.86]  But, yeah, the viewers in Australia, this works for them.
[2860.86 --> 2863.86]  But everyone else pretty much gets the shaft on this starting time.
[2863.86 --> 2868.86]  So, at some point I'll move it and we'll figure out a way to make that work for everyone.
[2868.86 --> 2875.86]  Alright, Facundo Castells says, I don't know if I did that right,
[2875.86 --> 2881.86]  14 milliseconds for an IPS monitor is good enough for gaming or will I have very hard ghosting?
[2881.86 --> 2883.86]  You know what? That spec is probably meaningless.
[2883.86 --> 2888.86]  Best thing is find other people who have that exact monitor, ask them what they think,
[2888.86 --> 2894.86]  find out if it's going good for them, because the spec is measured a lot of different ways, totally meaningless.
[2894.86 --> 2896.86]  So that's the only way to know for sure.
[2896.86 --> 2902.86]  Adam Lee says, I have two 550 Ti's. Only difference is VRAM, 1 and 2 gig.
[2902.86 --> 2904.86]  There is no option for SLI.
[2904.86 --> 2909.86]  Like I said, on I think one of my previous videos, you need matching cards for SLI.
[2909.86 --> 2911.86]  That means the same GPU.
[2911.86 --> 2917.86]  And although in theory, I've seen evidence from, like I've seen NVIDIA posts at some point, this was years ago though,
[2917.86 --> 2927.86]  that you can SLI mismatched memory cards. The last time I tried it was with an 8800 GTS 320 and an 8800 GTS 640.
[2927.86 --> 2932.86]  These were identical cards, save for the amount of RAM, and I wasn't able to enable SLI.
[2932.86 --> 2935.86]  So my personal experience is that it doesn't work.
[2935.86 --> 2938.86]  Jonathan, you better not be doing that.
[2938.86 --> 2942.86]  That is not cool, man. Not cool, man.
[2942.86 --> 2946.86]  Hey, Amintha says, hey from Edmonton!
[2946.86 --> 2948.86]  Hey from Edmonton too!
[2948.86 --> 2957.86]  I guess it's good to be in Edmonton this year because the Vancouver Canucks don't have to kick the Oilers' butt so hard in hockey for the entire season.
[2958.86 --> 2961.86]  And I just lost a viewer from Edmonton.
[2961.86 --> 2969.86]  But seriously guys, I mean I don't know how many Canadians there are here, but this is the third work stoppage that we've had in the NHL.
[2969.86 --> 2974.86]  The third work stoppage in the NHL since Gary Bettman has been commissioner.
[2974.86 --> 2977.86]  And I personally am like super steamed up about this.
[2977.86 --> 2980.86]  I know you guys did not tune in for Sports Talk Radio.
[2980.86 --> 2981.86]  That is not what you're into.
[2981.86 --> 2982.86]  But come on!
[2982.86 --> 2984.86]  Okay, so a few different things.
[2984.86 --> 2988.86]  If you guys aren't in Canada or you don't care and you're not familiar with the lockout.
[2988.86 --> 2995.86]  Okay, so basically, there was a collective bargaining agreement back in 2004 that everyone signed.
[2995.86 --> 2999.86]  Okay, the league signed, the players signed.
[2999.86 --> 3004.86]  Okay, now it's renegotiation time and the league, the players made a lot of concessions last time.
[3004.86 --> 3010.86]  The league is basically going, okay, whatever share of the profits you guys were getting before, we're cutting that.
[3010.86 --> 3014.86]  I think it's about by 20%, so it's a huge cut from the players.
[3014.86 --> 3017.86]  Because we have to control the expenditures and the cost.
[3017.86 --> 3019.86]  The league is making more money than they ever have before.
[3019.86 --> 3021.86]  They're doing great as a whole.
[3021.86 --> 3023.86]  Yes, some teams aren't doing well.
[3023.86 --> 3024.86]  But you know what?
[3024.86 --> 3032.86]  Maybe it's time to man up, be like the NFL and implement revenue sharing from the premium teams that are doing really well to the dog teams that aren't doing really well.
[3032.86 --> 3034.86]  Okay, so maybe that's the solution.
[3034.86 --> 3036.86]  The league is doing great as a whole.
[3036.86 --> 3039.86]  So this time around, they're saying, okay, yeah, we can't afford to pay you this much.
[3039.86 --> 3040.86]  Now, here's the kicker.
[3040.86 --> 3042.86]  Here's what kills me about this whole thing.
[3042.86 --> 3052.86]  In the time between the end of last season and the lockout commencing, we had huge, huge mega contracts being signed with players.
[3052.86 --> 3057.86]  We're talking like huge long-term contracts worth 20, 30, 50 million dollars.
[3057.86 --> 3058.86]  Can't remember the details.
[3058.86 --> 3065.86]  I just remember that I was super mad about it because here are the owners and the league saying, oh, we have to control player salaries.
[3065.86 --> 3069.86]  So we have to cut down how much we can pay the players in order to reach an agreement here.
[3069.86 --> 3076.86]  And then here's the, here's on the other hand, they're saying, oh, here's a whole bunch of money to aging players.
[3076.86 --> 3080.86]  And we, so do you want to keep your payroll under control?
[3080.86 --> 3083.86]  Do you not want to keep your payroll under control?
[3083.86 --> 3090.86]  I don't know what the answer is, but we're going back to tech because hockey is stupid and there's no hockey and this year.
[3090.86 --> 3094.86]  And that makes me very sad, but it gives me more time for benchmarking video cards.
[3094.86 --> 3097.86]  So I guess it worked out for all of us.
[3097.86 --> 3098.86]  Moving right along here.
[3098.86 --> 3102.86]  So sorry for the hockey rant for those of you who aren't interested in hockey.
[3102.86 --> 3108.86]  Linus, I see you have a Zonar Sense in your rig and I'm planning to get one, but why aren't you using the PC 350 headset?
[3108.86 --> 3109.86]  Because I hate it.
[3109.86 --> 3110.86]  Because I don't like it.
[3110.86 --> 3117.86]  Because the Zonar Sense is a great sound card and the PC 350 my wife is using because she has funny shaped ears and it fits on her head or something.
[3117.86 --> 3118.86]  So there you go.
[3118.86 --> 3119.86]  All right.
[3119.86 --> 3120.86]  Here are questions.
[3120.86 --> 3124.86]  HeavyHD says, I love when someone responds to my tweets and live streams.
[3124.86 --> 3125.86]  You're welcome.
[3125.86 --> 3130.86]  I recently bought an agility for 128 gig and I'm only getting around 250 megabyte reads and write.
[3130.86 --> 3132.86]  That's probably about right actually.
[3132.86 --> 3137.86]  Agility for 128 gig, especially once you fill it up more than half, is not that fast of a drive.
[3137.86 --> 3147.86]  The InderLynx controller, Marvell controller that's powered by InderLynx firmware, is not as fast once the drive gets more full as it is when the drive is empty.
[3147.86 --> 3148.86]  Something to be aware of.
[3148.86 --> 3152.86]  Jamie, when do you think Thunderbolt is going to be coming to the PC?
[3152.86 --> 3155.86]  Can you explain why it's still absent on the PC?
[3155.86 --> 3160.86]  Jamie, my main man, Thunderbolt is here.
[3160.86 --> 3163.86]  I have done like six videos about it.
[3163.86 --> 3164.86]  Check this out.
[3164.86 --> 3170.86]  You can get a Thunderbolt enabled motherboard from MSI for, is this the cheap one?
[3170.86 --> 3171.86]  Yeah, I think this is the one.
[3171.86 --> 3173.86]  For under $200 now.
[3173.86 --> 3175.86]  Thunderbolt, MSI motherboard, under $200.
[3175.86 --> 3177.86]  It's so new there isn't a picture.
[3177.86 --> 3181.86]  This is a brand new SKU, 77016 on NCIX.
[3181.86 --> 3183.86]  Z77A, G45 Thunderbolt.
[3183.86 --> 3185.86]  Thunderbolt is here.
[3185.86 --> 3187.86]  And Thunderbolt may actually end up coming in handy for me.
[3187.86 --> 3194.86]  Because I think in order to capture the kind of 1080p and 4K streams I'm going to want to do,
[3194.86 --> 3200.86]  I'm going to need like multiple WD dual Thunderbolt enclosures with velociraptors in them.
[3200.86 --> 3202.86]  I'm going to need to raid zero a whole whack of them.
[3202.86 --> 3206.86]  And things are going to get crazy.
[3206.86 --> 3209.86]  Can you give a shout out to North Van?
[3209.86 --> 3211.86]  I can! Shout out to North Van.
[3211.86 --> 3213.86]  Oh! You know what?
[3213.86 --> 3220.86]  I promised, I promised someone who actually requested, and this doesn't happen that often,
[3220.86 --> 3225.86]  but someone requested that I autograph something for them and send it to them.
[3225.86 --> 3228.86]  And they're in like Europe or something.
[3228.86 --> 3231.86]  So I was just like, oh, you know what?
[3231.86 --> 3236.86]  I don't think it's realistic for me to autograph something and ship it there.
[3236.86 --> 3240.86]  I mean, you know, it's really cool that you asked and I'm super flattered and all of that.
[3240.86 --> 3250.86]  But I promised that I would give a shout out in this live stream to my very special viewer.
[3250.86 --> 3254.86]  Hold on. Where is it? Where is it?
[3254.86 --> 3256.86]  Do do do do do do do do.
[3258.86 --> 3260.86]  Here we go.
[3260.86 --> 3262.86]  Michael Warchal.
[3262.86 --> 3264.86]  Warchal? Oh boy.
[3264.86 --> 3265.86]  He's from Poland.
[3265.86 --> 3269.86]  And I promised I would give a big shout out to Michael.
[3269.86 --> 3273.86]  Thank you for watching Tech Tips, Michael, and all of that good stuff.
[3273.86 --> 3275.86]  And that goes along with my shout out to North Van.
[3275.86 --> 3278.86]  Linus, I have 269.50, soon to be 3.
[3278.86 --> 3279.86]  Oh, please don't have a third one.
[3279.86 --> 3281.86]  Do you think I should upgrade to dual 79 70s?
[3281.86 --> 3282.86]  Yes.
[3282.86 --> 3286.86]  Two cards is always better than 3, in much the same way that one card is usually better than 2.
[3286.86 --> 3287.86]  No pin.
[3287.86 --> 3288.86]  Do you get Poison Ivy, Linus?
[3288.86 --> 3292.86]  Well, when I walk around in Poison Ivy, yes, I do.
[3292.86 --> 3293.86]  I have another question.
[3293.86 --> 3295.86]  Is that wireless headset good?
[3295.86 --> 3296.86]  Oh, okay.
[3296.86 --> 3297.86]  Corsair 2000 wireless headset.
[3297.86 --> 3301.86]  If you want a wireless headset, actually it's about as good as I could recommend.
[3301.86 --> 3303.86]  It's a great value for the price.
[3303.86 --> 3308.86]  The USB sound card is probably better than your crappy on-board sound, but not nearly as good as a dedicated sound card.
[3308.86 --> 3312.86]  But, for the convenience of wireless, not a bad value at all.
[3312.86 --> 3313.86]  What's a better case?
[3313.86 --> 3314.86]  The 600T or the 650D?
[3314.86 --> 3316.86]  I love the look of the 650D.
[3316.86 --> 3322.86]  The 600T is probably a little bit cooler in terms of temperatures, and probably a little bit easier to build in.
[3322.86 --> 3325.86]  But, personally, I'd go 650D, because I'm all about aesthetics.
[3325.86 --> 3328.86]  SR2 versus SRX, which one to get?
[3328.86 --> 3329.86]  Don't get either of them.
[3329.86 --> 3334.86]  Get a 2011 board, like a proper single socket 2011 board, or get an LGA 1155 board.
[3334.86 --> 3343.86]  The CPUs for those sockets cannot be overclocked, which means you will get more performance, unless you're doing heavy workstation usage out of a desktop board.
[3343.86 --> 3347.86]  What power supply would you recommend for this configuration right here?
[3347.86 --> 3353.86]  I would recommend probably in the neighborhood of a good quality 850 to 1000W power supply.
[3353.86 --> 3358.86]  Something like a High Current Pro 1000 Platinum, or an XFX 1000 Platinum.
[3358.86 --> 3364.86]  Basically, you want efficiency. You want about 850 to 1000W for a configuration like that.
[3364.86 --> 3370.86]  Building a new PC. Single 680 or 2660 Ti is an SLI. 2660 Ti is an SLI.
[3370.86 --> 3377.86]  660 Ti is so close to 670 and 680 in performance, and so much less in price, that it's actually an outstanding value.
[3377.86 --> 3386.86]  Just now, you said about platform and socket. What would you recommend for people who are building a performance PC, year-end, middle of next year?
[3386.86 --> 3390.86]  No idea for middle of next year. I can't remember when Haswell is coming out, but year-end now?
[3390.86 --> 3393.86]  Build an LGA 1155 system.
[3393.86 --> 3396.86]  Peyton says, give me my boyfriend back.
[3396.86 --> 3399.86]  That's a very strange thing to say.
[3399.86 --> 3403.86]  Who is your boyfriend? I'm really curious now.
[3403.86 --> 3407.86]  Alex says, what are your thoughts on how Fraps compares to XSplit?
[3407.86 --> 3409.86]  They're totally different. XSplit is for streaming.
[3409.86 --> 3418.86]  XSplit is what I'm using to broadcast this live video based on an HDMI input to my broadcasting PC to my viewers all around the world.
[3418.86 --> 3424.86]  Fraps is for recording something to a hard drive and then doing something with it later.
[3424.86 --> 3426.86]  Totally, totally different.
[3426.86 --> 3431.86]  Separate your audio stream from HDMI so we can still hear even when your video stream is hidden.
[3431.86 --> 3433.86]  Yes, I can look into doing that next week.
[3433.86 --> 3439.86]  Alternately, what I can do is I can kind of cheat and I can just throw the video in the background of the desktop capture one,
[3439.86 --> 3442.86]  so you can't see it, but the audio will still be there, so we'll figure out something.
[3442.86 --> 3445.86]  Something will work. Don't worry, guys.
[3445.86 --> 3449.86]  Oh, her boyfriend is watching my live stream. I understand now.
[3449.86 --> 3454.86]  What does overclocking Ram do? Who's your favorite pony?
[3454.86 --> 3461.86]  I had a pony growing up. His name was Bobby. He's probably dead now, but he will always be my favorite.
[3461.86 --> 3463.86]  Bobby was a white pony and was awesome.
[3463.86 --> 3466.86]  Oh, Stu Wachowski.
[3466.86 --> 3470.86]  Linus, I'm still running on my old socket 478 Pentium 4.
[3470.86 --> 3473.86]  Thoughts on the AMD 3870K as an upgrade?
[3473.86 --> 3481.86]  Okay, Stu, first things first. Don't get FM1. Get an FM2 board and CPU because you will have an upgrade path.
[3481.86 --> 3488.86]  FM1 is a dead platform. And second of all, an APU will be an excellent upgrade path for you if you're planning on using the onboard graphics.
[3488.86 --> 3499.86]  If you're not planning on using the onboard graphics, an older FENM 2 or a lower end FX chip is going to be an awesome option as well, or even something like a Core i3.
[3499.86 --> 3504.86]  Seth asks, do you think resolutions past 2560 by 1600 will be available soon?
[3504.86 --> 3512.86]  I sure hope so, Seth. I sure hope so because I really, really want higher resolution panels.
[3512.86 --> 3521.86]  And, I mean, the technology is there. If they can do this kind of pixel density, then why can't they just do a bigger one?
[3521.86 --> 3532.86]  I'll pay for it. I mean, an iPad screen isn't even expensive. So if we just kind of went, okay, so, you know, we'll 4X or 6X the size and then the yields will go down by this much.
[3532.86 --> 3538.86]  And, you know, it'll cost $1,000 or $2,000. I actually don't care. If you can deliver me a 4K 30-inch monitor.
[3538.86 --> 3548.86]  Here, any manufacturers watching this stream tonight, if you guys can deliver me a 4K 30-inch monitor, I will personally commit to spending $2,500 on one.
[3548.86 --> 3551.86]  Because I want one. So there, bam.
[3551.86 --> 3556.86]  Ah, should I upgrade my two Velociraptors to two SSDs?
[3556.86 --> 3558.86]  Which SSD?
[3558.86 --> 3560.86]  Lots of good choices right now.
[3560.86 --> 3566.86]  Samsung 830 is a great choice. The new 840 Pro is coming. That's an awesome choice.
[3566.86 --> 3572.86]  Vertex 4 is a great choice. Crucial M4 is a great choice. These are all great choices.
[3572.86 --> 3580.86]  And, you don't even need two SSDs to replace your two Velociraptors because one Velociraptor will destroy your...
[3580.86 --> 3588.86]  Or rather, one. One SSD will destroy your two Velociraptors. You are going to wonder how you ever tolerated Velociraptors.
[3588.86 --> 3593.86]  And you might not notice right away, but you'll notice when you go back and try to use Velociraptors.
[3593.86 --> 3600.86]  I have problems with Molex plugs to control my fans. Jared, the problem is that you're using Molex plugs to control your fans.
[3600.86 --> 3607.86]  You're going to want to get like inline 3-pin resistors or a fan controller in order to control your fans.
[3607.86 --> 3612.86]  Gary says, do you recommend the GTX 660 Ti from MSI or the Galaxy 3 gig?
[3612.86 --> 3614.86]  I know that the MSI is triple overvolting.
[3614.86 --> 3620.86]  First of all, if you watched last week's livestream, you'll know that the triple overvolting has gotten pretty complicated now.
[3620.86 --> 3625.86]  And then the other thing is, whether you need 3 gigs or not really depends on the resolution you're running.
[3625.86 --> 3632.86]  3 gigs is not going to be useful unless you're running like 2560 by 1440 or you're running multiple 1080p panels.
[3632.86 --> 3637.86]  Kyle, have you seen the Murder Box, Murder Mod? Do you have any plans of making your TJ07 like them?
[3637.86 --> 3643.86]  No. I'm more of a simple guy. I'm just kind of drumming holes in my TJ07 and then I'm just going to powder coat it and call it a day.
[3643.86 --> 3654.86]  I'm too cheap for that. However, I don't know if you've seen the new MK3 that Charles has brought into this world, but it is amazing.
[3654.86 --> 3659.86]  Murder Box MK3, I think that's what it's called. Here it is.
[3659.86 --> 3669.86]  So this case costs something ludicrous. Like, I think it's like well over a thousand dollars. It's like fifteen hundred dollars or something like that.
[3669.86 --> 3677.86]  But it's just amazing. Modular drive structure assembly. Printed circuit board for distributing power and data to all of your drives.
[3677.86 --> 3685.86]  It's got like a really unique top grill. I've seen one of these in person. I actually saw the prototype one at CES last year.
[3685.86 --> 3689.86]  It's got the serpentine thing going down the back. It's just awesome.
[3689.86 --> 3693.86]  And who's asking if I'm using Internet Explorer? This is Firefox. Get over yourself.
[3693.86 --> 3703.86]  Yeah, it's awesome. So basically it's a TJ07 but modded at the factory level by Charles, the murder guy.
[3703.86 --> 3715.86]  So there you go. So yeah, I love it but there's no way I'm gonna spend the money, I guess, to go for that.
[3715.86 --> 3723.86]  But hey, Joel says it's okay to eat while you live stream. You know what? You guys, think of it this way.
[3723.86 --> 3730.86]  I have almost eighteen hundred people now tuning in to watch me do something that hopefully is entertaining.
[3730.86 --> 3737.86]  I owe it to you guys to pay attention so that you have my full and undivided attention during that time.
[3737.86 --> 3743.86]  Okay? So I'm not gonna do that. You guys, I'm gonna take Twitter questions for the rest of the night.
[3743.86 --> 3747.86]  So if you guys aren't interested in Twitter questions then I guess you can tune out now.
[3747.86 --> 3749.86]  But I hope you guys are interested.
[3749.86 --> 3752.86]  Jared, USB headset better than onboard? Yes.
[3752.86 --> 3758.86]  However, solutions like this are awesome. This is the Zonar U3. So this is just a little USB sound card.
[3758.86 --> 3764.86]  If you're using a laptop that you can't add a sound card to or if you don't want to invest a ton of money into a proper sound card,
[3764.86 --> 3774.86]  this is a great solution. It actually has an amped output. I mean, not, I think it's up to 150 ohm resistance for the headphones.
[3774.86 --> 3780.86]  It has a great microphone in, very clean, great solution. But yes, the USB headset is better.
[3780.86 --> 3785.86]  Albin says, what is good for editing video cards? Priority for the processor first, then the graphics card.
[3785.86 --> 3790.86]  Okay, couple things. If you're using Adobe, you want a CUDA capable graphics card. Diesel taught me this.
[3790.86 --> 3795.86]  You must have CUDA because it does real-time acceleration for all kinds of great stuff in Adobe.
[3795.86 --> 3799.86]  You don't even need a workstation card. So priority number one, make sure you got a CUDA card.
[3799.86 --> 3806.86]  Priority number two, well, almost priority one slash two for both of these. Beast CPU because video encoding,
[3806.86 --> 3811.86]  video exporting from video editing applications is still heavily CPU dependent.
[3811.86 --> 3817.86]  You will also need boatloads of RAM, at least 16 gigs of RAM in a 1080p, reasonably high-end editing machine
[3817.86 --> 3823.86]  where you're doing any kind of After Effects. 32 gigs even preferred, but 16 gigs should be great.
[3823.86 --> 3836.86]  And then finally, if I was going to do a final upgrade, I would go to a Quadro card with a full, high, whatever it is, full spectrum, whatever, more color depth.
[3836.86 --> 3842.86]  So Quadro cards can output deep color and then you can get monitors that have 8-bit panels in them
[3842.86 --> 3846.86]  so that you can actually see to a greater degree of accuracy what you're working on.
[3846.86 --> 3853.86]  So that's where I would get into a more professional editing setup.
[3853.86 --> 3857.86]  I'm in Ontario. Canada Computers is beating NCI-X prices 80% of the time.
[3857.86 --> 3862.86]  Will you guys price match? Absolutely. NCI-X price matches every day, all day, all the time.
[3862.86 --> 3867.86]  Walk in, show them the price on the computer, done. It will price match it for you.
[3867.86 --> 3870.86]  Dragon says, what do you think of the Plex store M5 SSDs? They're outstanding.
[3870.86 --> 3874.86]  Again, I'm sorry I missed them. I should have mentioned them. Great options.
[3874.86 --> 3878.86]  Plex store has done an amazing job of optimizing their firmwares.
[3878.86 --> 3884.86]  So I don't know if you guys know this, but Plex store is a major manufacturer and they are all about QC.
[3884.86 --> 3889.86]  I mean, even going back to optical drives, Plex store was all about the best quality.
[3889.86 --> 3892.86]  So their SSDs are outstanding. So there you go.
[3892.86 --> 3895.86]  Joe, what are the specs of your streaming PC? Oh, funny you should ask.
[3895.86 --> 3900.86]  Okay, it's got a 2500K that I've overclocked just a little bit in a Shuttle Z68.
[3900.86 --> 3905.86]  It's got 8 gigs of RAM and it's got two HDMI capture cards.
[3905.86 --> 3910.86]  I'm using onboard video because I want to at some point, okay, I'm really excited about this.
[3910.86 --> 3912.86]  So right now we're doing a single camera.
[3912.86 --> 3917.86]  Realistically, for this live show, once we get a proper set, now that we've got a camera,
[3917.86 --> 3921.86]  I want two HDMI streams coming in, I want a dual camera setup.
[3921.86 --> 3925.86]  So we have a lock shot, just a single sort of fixed camera angle there.
[3925.86 --> 3930.86]  And then we can have like a floating cameraman who can, we can have guests and they can come get different angles
[3930.86 --> 3932.86]  or they can come look at close ups of what I'm looking at.
[3932.86 --> 3937.86]  And that's what I really want. I want more like a broadcast experience for the live streams here.
[3937.86 --> 3943.86]  So that's why I went with dual capture cards and a reasonably beefy PC.
[3943.86 --> 3947.86]  But I still haven't figured out how I'm going to get all of that data off of a computer.
[3947.86 --> 3953.86]  I mean, I might end up with like an eSATA output to like a tower for one of the streams
[3953.86 --> 3957.86]  and then a USB 3 output to a tower for the other. I don't know how I'm going to do that.
[3957.86 --> 3959.86]  We'll get to that. We'll get to that.
[3959.86 --> 3965.86]  What about the Razer Tiamat? The Razer Tiamat is a gaming headset. I haven't heard it. It might be great, but I just sort of doubt it.
[3965.86 --> 3968.86]  David, do you think there will be more multi-touch desktop monitors?
[3968.86 --> 3972.86]  Absolutely. I am super excited about desktop multi-touch monitors.
[3972.86 --> 3978.86]  I did another episode of NCI's Tech Tips that will be coming out soon with the Acer 10-point multi-touch monitor.
[3978.86 --> 3985.86]  Just a guide on the gestures you can use in Windows 8. I am just super excited about the whole touchscreen experience.
[3985.86 --> 3990.86]  Nathaniel says, I'm a Toronto fan, so it doesn't really bother me.
[3990.86 --> 3993.86]  Oh, I think he's talking about the hockey talk.
[3993.86 --> 3996.86]  But anyways, do you have recommendations for routers?
[3996.86 --> 4002.86]  Right now, I'm using an EA 4500 with the non-Cisco Cloud firmware. Super happy with it.
[4002.86 --> 4013.86]  Although WD's new MyNet routers look very exciting, especially the 900 series with the on-the-fly adaptive quality of service,
[4013.86 --> 4019.86]  I haven't actually tried it yet though, so give me a little while and I will try it out.
[4019.86 --> 4022.86]  And I'm super, super excited to try that out.
[4022.86 --> 4025.86]  So those are the two that I would sort of look at.
[4025.86 --> 4029.86]  You can't go wrong with Linksys. It's just, yeah, you can't go wrong.
[4029.86 --> 4032.86]  Connor says, when do you think they'll make OLED monitors?
[4032.86 --> 4038.86]  Connor, not soon enough. I want my 4K 30-inch OLED monitor and I'm super excited.
[4038.86 --> 4042.86]  I'm just, I'm so sad that Canon SED never made it.
[4042.86 --> 4045.86]  I mean, this was exciting stuff.
[4045.86 --> 4048.86]  Canon was developing this in collaboration with someone.
[4048.86 --> 4052.86]  It was supposed to bring, yeah, see SED is dead. Thanks a lot for that.
[4052.86 --> 4055.86]  Surface or something, whatever. They had prototypes.
[4055.86 --> 4058.86]  It was going to be as thin as LCD at the time.
[4058.86 --> 4063.86]  It was going to have the response times of CRT, the contrast ratios, the colors of CRT.
[4063.86 --> 4067.86]  And it was like, yeah, matrix of tiny cathode ray tubes.
[4067.86 --> 4069.86]  It was too expensive. It never happened.
[4069.86 --> 4073.86]  And I'm just, oh, I read about that and I was so excited.
[4073.86 --> 4075.86]  I wanted SED so bad.
[4075.86 --> 4078.86]  And I'm, yeah, OLED is what I'll settle for.
[4078.86 --> 4082.86]  I have two 560 Ti's and two SLI's. Should I upgrade to a single 680?
[4082.86 --> 4085.86]  You know what? You will have a better gaming experience on the single 680.
[4085.86 --> 4089.86]  However, I'd probably go for a slightly better value. Go with the 670.
[4089.86 --> 4091.86]  You'll still get a great experience.
[4091.86 --> 4095.86]  Gary, I have no experience with the 360's unfortunately.
[4095.86 --> 4096.86]  I've heard they're way better.
[4096.86 --> 4099.86]  Alright, Matthew. Let's check out your TJ07.
[4099.86 --> 4101.86]  I don't usually indulge with, wow, that looks really nice.
[4101.86 --> 4103.86]  This is a great build.
[4103.86 --> 4107.86]  When I have a forum, we're going to have to have like a poster build section
[4107.86 --> 4113.86]  so you guys can all just check out the, they have like fantastic and awesome builds that you all do.
[4113.86 --> 4115.86]  So we're going to, let's look at this a little bit bigger here.
[4115.86 --> 4119.86]  Really? That's Facebook's idea of, oh, there we go.
[4119.86 --> 4122.86]  Okay, well, I'm seeing it in full screen, but you guys are probably getting it cut off.
[4122.86 --> 4123.86]  That is outstanding.
[4123.86 --> 4125.86]  Great cable sleeving.
[4125.86 --> 4127.86]  Two GTX 680's.
[4127.86 --> 4131.86]  LGA 1155 platform, which is, okay, yeah, I'll have full screen.
[4131.86 --> 4132.86]  Okay, let's close that.
[4132.86 --> 4135.86]  LGA 1155 platform, which is smart.
[4135.86 --> 4142.86]  Not what I ended up going with for my sort of enthusiast class machine, but it's smart.
[4142.86 --> 4145.86]  You had all the performance and that, yeah, that looks outstanding.
[4145.86 --> 4146.86]  Great build.
[4146.86 --> 4148.86]  There's no way I'm putting that much work into mine.
[4148.86 --> 4154.86]  I love the, I love the clean mid plate, but I'm just kind of looking at it going like, eh, I can get one cut.
[4154.86 --> 4160.86]  I can get it powder coated after I drill some holes and stuff, but I'm just, I upgrade my rig so often
[4160.86 --> 4165.86]  and I'm always tinkering around with it, that it's actually more work than it's worth for me to have tubes, like, routed through holes and stuff.
[4165.86 --> 4167.86]  So I'm just going to leave the stock mid plate.
[4167.86 --> 4174.86]  Ash wants to know, is it even possible to have a resolution of 2560 by 1600 that runs on 120 Hertz?
[4174.86 --> 4176.86]  The problem right now is DVI.
[4176.86 --> 4185.86]  DVI can't carry any more than 1920 by 1200 120 Hertz or 2560 by 1600 60 Hertz.
[4185.86 --> 4191.86]  So DisplayPort will have a way for us to make things more better.
[4191.86 --> 4195.86]  Foxington Fox, do you think that dual socket is worth it for rendering video, etc?
[4195.86 --> 4200.86]  It can be, but you've got to be working on really high end stuff in order for that to start to make a difference.
[4200.86 --> 4202.86]  What do you think about the 558s?
[4202.86 --> 4204.86]  Haven't tried them unfortunately.
[4204.86 --> 4205.86]  Sorry man.
[4205.86 --> 4207.86]  Best gaming headset, price no object.
[4207.86 --> 4210.86]  7H, same answer as before.
[4210.86 --> 4216.86]  What do you think about two caviar black hard drives in RAID 0, not for holding vital info, just for speed?
[4216.86 --> 4219.86]  You're not going to get a great speed experience out of it man, I'm sorry.
[4219.86 --> 4222.86]  SSD is the way to go for speed.
[4222.86 --> 4231.86]  People who think that hard drives are almost as fast as SSDs because of the sequential megabyte per second ratings of them are kidding themselves.
[4231.86 --> 4234.86]  It's not about that at all.
[4234.86 --> 4236.86]  Not about that at all.
[4236.86 --> 4241.86]  So yes, it's all about random, which SSD is way better for.
[4241.86 --> 4244.86]  Are you really running an AGP video card?
[4244.86 --> 4246.86]  I'm sorry man, I'm very sorry to hear that.
[4246.86 --> 4248.86]  WinFour 3 or TwinFros are 5?
[4248.86 --> 4249.86]  Hard to say.
[4249.86 --> 4258.86]  Part of the problem with these brandings, so DirectCU, WinForce and TwinFroser, is that a lot of the time it's actually a different cooler on every given card.
[4258.86 --> 4260.86]  Different number of heat pipes, different fans.
[4260.86 --> 4262.86]  What do you want me to say?
[4262.86 --> 4265.86]  It comes down to the individual cards.
[4265.86 --> 4266.86]  Who's my favorite My Little Pony?
[4266.86 --> 4268.86]  You know what, I was never actually into My Little Pony.
[4268.86 --> 4271.86]  I know I mention it from time to time, but I'm just joking.
[4271.86 --> 4273.86]  Is a 600Hz TV good for gaming?
[4273.86 --> 4275.86]  Not that I will go over 140.
[4275.86 --> 4278.86]  A 600Hz TV is not a 600Hz display.
[4278.86 --> 4282.86]  And it's probably fine for gaming because a 600Hz TV is bound to be a pretty high end one.
[4282.86 --> 4283.86]  Unless it's a plasma.
[4283.86 --> 4285.86]  In which case, yes, plasmas are great for gaming.
[4285.86 --> 4292.86]  The only disadvantage of plasma these days is that it's not as good in a bright environment.
[4292.86 --> 4294.86]  So you have to have a darker room.
[4294.86 --> 4299.86]  Tester says, I'm interested in this YouTube thing and I'm thinking about starting a channel.
[4299.86 --> 4300.86]  Can you give me tips for that?
[4300.86 --> 4301.86]  Minus YouTube tips.
[4301.86 --> 4310.86]  My tip would be that, um, what do I say without sort of being discouraging?
[4310.86 --> 4313.86]  How do you, people ask me this all the time.
[4313.86 --> 4315.86]  How do I do this YouTube thing?
[4315.86 --> 4316.86]  And I don't have a good answer.
[4316.86 --> 4324.86]  So, priority number one is however much energy you think you're projecting, amp it up by five times.
[4324.86 --> 4331.86]  Because there's all those jokes about how the camera adds 10 pounds or, you know, takes off 2 inches or whatever the camera does.
[4331.86 --> 4338.86]  The camera tones down your energy level to about a quarter or a tenth of what you're actually doing.
[4338.86 --> 4344.86]  If I were to talk the way I actually talk to a person, like the way I talk to someone in real life, this is what I'd sound like.
[4344.86 --> 4348.86]  I'd be like, okay, yeah, hey, how's it going and this is how I talk to people.
[4348.86 --> 4350.86]  It's not very interesting.
[4350.86 --> 4357.86]  You, you, people who, you know, put on their headset mic and they're like, yeah, so on, I'm doing a live stream right now.
[4357.86 --> 4362.86]  I'm streaming my gaming, you know, I ran across the bridge and oh man, there was like a troll underneath.
[4362.86 --> 4374.86]  And the problem with the way you talk to talk to a person is that it assumes that they are making eye contact with you, that they are engaging in your facial expressions and your gestures.
[4374.86 --> 4379.86]  And that they can see the context of everything around you and it keeps them engaged.
[4379.86 --> 4385.86]  Okay, they're also there in person. They can smell you, they can hear you, they can see you, they can use their senses.
[4385.86 --> 4393.86]  When you're on video, when you're on video, they don't have the benefit of all of that.
[4393.86 --> 4395.86]  Every gesture has to be way bigger.
[4395.86 --> 4399.86]  That's why on a stage or on a movie, the actors wear all this makeup.
[4399.86 --> 4409.86]  Like, have you ever gone to a play and seen any of the actors after the performance and when you see them up close, they've got like this makeup caked onto their faces and their eyes are painted up like you wouldn't believe.
[4409.86 --> 4423.86]  Because when you're further away, when you don't have that context, you have to emphasize things so much more for people to get the point, to get engaged, to be excited, to be amped up the same way that you are.
[4423.86 --> 4435.86]  So that's tip number one. And that is not a grow up. This is a fig tree. It's a fig tree. It doesn't even look like a marijuana plant. This is the leaf. What are you talking about?
[4435.86 --> 4438.86]  Geez. Kids today, that's what I say.
[4438.86 --> 4442.86]  Okay, tip number two is you're not going to make it alone.
[4442.86 --> 4449.86]  For every Jenna Marbles, there are... I mean at this point, there's so many YouTube users. There's probably like...
[4449.86 --> 4457.86]  For every Jenna Marbles, there's probably a million people who are getting 10 to 15 views on every video that they put out.
[4457.86 --> 4461.86]  The way that I made it was with a partnership.
[4461.86 --> 4468.86]  So, I had a retailer that I was partnered with that gave me access to the hardware, gave me access to the equipment I needed.
[4468.86 --> 4475.86]  I don't know if I could have done this 100% on my own or at least I wouldn't have the momentum that I have.
[4475.86 --> 4483.86]  So that's another thing, is figure out partnerships. Don't try to do it alone. Don't try and be like the lone wolf.
[4483.86 --> 4487.86]  And no, I don't watch Jenna Marbles. I can't stand her videos.
[4487.86 --> 4493.86]  I made it about a third of the way through one not that long ago and I was just kind of like, okay.
[4493.86 --> 4501.86]  So she swears. She's kind of crude. She's a lot more popular than I am. So, you know, full points for that. That's cool.
[4501.86 --> 4508.86]  But it just doesn't really do it for me. I don't know. I just... Yeah, it just didn't really do it for me.
[4508.86 --> 4512.86]  Okay, so anyway, that's all the tips I have for YouTube for tonight.
[4512.86 --> 4516.86]  Try to say my name? Mattias Brandolini. That's not hard.
[4516.86 --> 4519.86]  For Mattias, Mattias, Brandolini.
[4519.86 --> 4523.86]  I actually went to school with a girl last name Brandolini.
[4523.86 --> 4527.86]  What do I think of the Triton AX Pro? I don't think much of it. I think that you should get...
[4527.86 --> 4531.86]  The thing about audio is you want to go with a company that understands audio. Someone like Sennheiser.
[4531.86 --> 4534.86]  Okay, shout out to Matthew from Australia. But that's it for the shout outs. No more shout outs tonight.
[4534.86 --> 4544.86]  Thomas asks what monitor I'm using right now. This is a Samsung Sync Master 215TW. Super old, but my personal philosophy, anything but TN.
[4544.86 --> 4550.86]  The input lag on this thing is terrible. It's hardly even usable. But I hate TN monitors. I won't use them.
[4550.86 --> 4555.86]  Unless they're 120Hz and they're 3D ready, in which case you don't really have a choice because there's nothing else.
[4555.86 --> 4561.86]  Thomas says, just got this error. Windows detected hard drive failure. I don't have enough storage to back up till tomorrow.
[4561.86 --> 4567.86]  What to do now? Shut down, Thomas. Shut down right now and hope that it still works.
[4567.86 --> 4576.86]  Oh, I'm sorry. Twitter's not up. There you go, guys. I hope that it stays working long enough for you to sort of do okay with that.
[4576.86 --> 4583.86]  Joseph, when using quiet fans on a triple rad, is it better for the radiator to be thin or thicker? Does it really matter?
[4583.86 --> 4587.86]  You want the lowest restriction possible if you're looking for a quiet setup.
[4587.86 --> 4596.86]  So that means you either want a thick rad with very, very loose, thin spacing, or you want a thin rad so that you'll still be able to get air to move through the radiator.
[4596.86 --> 4599.86]  It's just not going to get, like, stocked out right.
[4599.86 --> 4605.86]  Okay. Please read. Which is your favorite 680 brand? What do I think about the GA GTX 680s?
[4605.86 --> 4614.86]  A 680 is kind of a 680 for me until they put on a custom cooler or throw some additional warranty support at it or design a custom PCB.
[4614.86 --> 4618.86]  I'm pretty big into MSI's lightning cards. Love their lightning cards.
[4618.86 --> 4623.86]  Though it's hard to go wrong with EVGA, especially on their very high-end cards where they still have lifetime warranties.
[4623.86 --> 4625.86]  So, there you go.
[4625.86 --> 4631.86]  Kurtz, would you ever branch out into gaming or any genre of gaming for your channels? It'd be cool to see your hardware choices for games.
[4631.86 --> 4636.86]  My hardware choices are almost always catered to gamers.
[4636.86 --> 4640.86]  That's one of the reasons I'm here on Twitch as opposed to being somewhere else random.
[4640.86 --> 4644.86]  Because everything I talk about hardware-wise is all about the gaming experience.
[4644.86 --> 4648.86]  I mean, yeah, I can give tips on things like video editing or whatever else.
[4648.86 --> 4652.86]  But, um, yeah.
[4652.86 --> 4655.86]  I'm probably not going to do any game, gameplay videos.
[4655.86 --> 4657.86]  But it's possible that Slick will do some at some point.
[4657.86 --> 4660.86]  My understanding is he's pretty good at Dota.
[4660.86 --> 4663.86]  Ah, Boston Stabler.
[4663.86 --> 4666.86]  Linus, you should unbox upside down after you have read the info.
[4666.86 --> 4669.86]  So you don't have to flip the unboxed product to make it up right.
[4669.86 --> 4671.86]  I've had a lot of people suggest that to me.
[4671.86 --> 4673.86]  Yes, I know I could do that.
[4673.86 --> 4677.86]  The reason I do it the way I do it is because when I'm storing the packages,
[4677.86 --> 4679.86]  the handles are usually on the top of the box.
[4679.86 --> 4684.86]  So if I always have the top of the box open, then I'll always have the handles in the right place.
[4684.86 --> 4686.86]  For boxes where it doesn't have handles and it doesn't matter,
[4686.86 --> 4690.86]  it's just helpful for me visually to know when I'm picking up a box,
[4690.86 --> 4692.86]  which end is the end that's open.
[4692.86 --> 4695.86]  So I always open up the top as opposed to anywhere else.
[4695.86 --> 4698.86]  Linus, something being delayed.
[4698.86 --> 4700.86]  Something's being delayed?
[4700.86 --> 4702.86]  Sorry guys, I don't know what's being delayed.
[4702.86 --> 4709.86]  I know that you guys don't see the stream until sort of a little while later when I sort of see that you saw it,
[4709.86 --> 4711.86]  but there's not a whole lot I can do about it.
[4711.86 --> 4713.86]  Linus, what are your thoughts on Microsoft Surface?
[4713.86 --> 4715.86]  I'm super excited about it.
[4715.86 --> 4717.86]  Very, very excited.
[4717.86 --> 4719.86]  What SSD would I recommend?
[4719.86 --> 4722.86]  120GB under $100, get an M4 or get an 830?
[4722.86 --> 4724.86]  Um...
[4724.86 --> 4731.86]  Have you ever mistered a man of a Mr. Man?
[4731.86 --> 4732.86]  Wait a minute.
[4732.86 --> 4734.86]  Are you talking about...
[4734.86 --> 4735.86]  Hold on.
[4735.86 --> 4738.86]  I might actually know what you're talking about.
[4738.86 --> 4742.86]  I'm not sure if I know what you're talking about, Kinjiro.
[4742.86 --> 4748.86]  But I have a random stuff folder in my photos here.
[4748.86 --> 4750.86]  Sorry, large icons.
[4750.86 --> 4754.86]  And I think I know the thing you're talking about.
[4754.86 --> 4755.86]  Uh...
[4755.86 --> 4756.86]  Okay.
[4756.86 --> 4758.86]  No, no, not that one.
[4758.86 --> 4760.86]  And then might be...
[4760.86 --> 4761.86]  Oh, might be this one.
[4761.86 --> 4762.86]  Maybe this one.
[4762.86 --> 4763.86]  Hold on.
[4763.86 --> 4764.86]  Hold on.
[4764.86 --> 4765.86]  I'm sorry guys.
[4765.86 --> 4766.86]  Bear with me here.
[4766.86 --> 4767.86]  This won't take long.
[4767.86 --> 4768.86]  Oh, that's not it.
[4768.86 --> 4771.86]  Oh, I might not be able to find it, but I think you can create like a Mr. Man of yourself
[4771.86 --> 4773.86]  on like the Mr. Man website.
[4773.86 --> 4776.86]  And I think that's what he's referring to.
[4776.86 --> 4778.86]  But I cannot find it.
[4778.86 --> 4779.86]  Alas.
[4779.86 --> 4780.86]  So...
[4780.86 --> 4781.86]  Yes, I have then.
[4781.86 --> 4782.86]  Dolly.
[4782.86 --> 4783.86]  Hello there.
[4783.86 --> 4786.86]  Installing a CPU water cooler for my friend.
[4786.86 --> 4788.86]  Any advice for a first timer with water cooling?
[4788.86 --> 4790.86]  With the pre-done kits, it's really simple.
[4790.86 --> 4792.86]  With the non-pre-done kits, watch my guide.
[4792.86 --> 4798.86]  I did a four-part video that covers selecting components, installing it, maintaining it.
[4798.86 --> 4800.86]  All good stuff.
[4800.86 --> 4801.86]  Uh...
[4801.86 --> 4803.86]  Will I ever tell my baby's name?
[4803.86 --> 4804.86]  I haven't decided yet.
[4804.86 --> 4809.86]  For now, I'm keeping his name quiet because, you know, as much as you guys might see baby
[4809.86 --> 4814.86]  pictures of him on Twitter or whatever else, I, you know, I don't want him to be in a situation
[4814.86 --> 4819.86]  where he goes to kindergarten and like, you know, people sort of know who he is already
[4819.86 --> 4820.86]  and it's kind of weird.
[4820.86 --> 4822.86]  So, uh...
[4822.86 --> 4823.86]  Yeah.
[4825.86 --> 4826.86]  Um...
[4827.86 --> 4828.86]  Yeah, that was...
[4828.86 --> 4830.86]  That was a picture of my wife, guys.
[4830.86 --> 4831.86]  That's not...
[4831.86 --> 4832.86]  That's not a...
[4832.86 --> 4833.86]  That's not a porn stash.
[4833.86 --> 4834.86]  That's...
[4834.86 --> 4835.86]  That's my wife.
[4839.86 --> 4840.86]  That's an old picture of her.
[4840.86 --> 4841.86]  That's when she was in, uh...
[4841.86 --> 4842.86]  She was in high school.
[4842.86 --> 4844.86]  Super, super photoshopped.
[4844.86 --> 4845.86]  But, uh...
[4845.86 --> 4846.86]  Yes.
[4846.86 --> 4847.86]  No lies.
[4847.86 --> 4848.86]  And, hey!
[4848.86 --> 4849.86]  Inappropriate.
[4849.86 --> 4850.86]  Whoever was saying that.
[4850.86 --> 4851.86]  Be appropriate.
[4851.86 --> 4852.86]  You guys.
[4852.86 --> 4853.86]  Um...
[4853.86 --> 4854.86]  Slick...
[4854.86 --> 4859.86]  Did Slick actually create a Twitch channel?
[4859.86 --> 4862.86]  I don't know if this is actually him.
[4862.86 --> 4865.86]  It looks like he's following me, but it could be anybody.
[4865.86 --> 4866.86]  Following Johnny Chu.
[4866.86 --> 4867.86]  I don't know if that's actually Slick.
[4867.86 --> 4868.86]  You should tweet him.
[4868.86 --> 4870.86]  Tweet him at SlickPC to find out if that's actually him.
[4870.86 --> 4871.86]  But if it is, then cool.
[4871.86 --> 4872.86]  Vincent!
[4872.86 --> 4873.86]  Greetings from Delta!
[4873.86 --> 4874.86]  I grew up in Delta, actually.
[4874.86 --> 4875.86]  In Ladner.
[4875.86 --> 4876.86]  And I think we're almost done.
[4876.86 --> 4880.86]  So I'm gonna find one more fantastic question to answer for you guys.
[4880.86 --> 4881.86]  Can we see how...
[4881.86 --> 4882.86]  Okay.
[4882.86 --> 4883.86]  This one I'll do.
[4883.86 --> 4884.86]  Okay.
[4884.86 --> 4886.86]  Can we see how fast you can do the ABCs in ASL?
[4886.86 --> 4891.86]  I'm really slow.
[4891.86 --> 4892.86]  There.
[4892.86 --> 4894.86]  That's how fast I can do them in ASL.
[4894.86 --> 4896.86]  I used to be a lot faster.
[4896.86 --> 4897.86]  Um...
[4897.86 --> 4898.86]  Okay.
[4898.86 --> 4900.86]  I'm gonna upgrade to a something something.
[4900.86 --> 4904.86]  Will MSI void my GPU warranty if I install an aftermarket water block?
[4904.86 --> 4905.86]  Not if they don't know about it.
[4905.86 --> 4906.86]  Um...
[4906.86 --> 4907.86]  Linus, do you think motherboard ATX...
[4907.86 --> 4912.86]  Uh, EVGA did one board with the ATX pin at a right angle.
[4912.86 --> 4913.86]  I don't think it matters, personally.
[4913.86 --> 4914.86]  I don't think it's a factor.
[4914.86 --> 4915.86]  Uh...
[4915.86 --> 4917.86]  Get the Lightning Brandon.
[4917.86 --> 4920.86]  I can play Battle of the ATX.
[4920.86 --> 4922.86]  I can play Battle of the ATX.
[4922.86 --> 4925.86]  I can play Battle of the ATX.
[4925.86 --> 4929.86]  I can play Battlefield 3 at 1080p on high with a 550 Ti.
[4929.86 --> 4930.86]  Yes.
[4930.86 --> 4933.86]  A 650 Ti would probably bump you up to ultra.
[4933.86 --> 4935.86]  Real life differences between DVI variations.
[4935.86 --> 4936.86]  No difference.
[4936.86 --> 4937.86]  Uh...
[4937.86 --> 4938.86]  Actually, I did...
[4938.86 --> 4939.86]  I did a display...
[4939.86 --> 4941.86]  I did a display thing.
[4941.86 --> 4942.86]  Youtube.com...
[4942.86 --> 4943.86]  Hold on.
[4943.86 --> 4944.86]  Uh...
[4944.86 --> 4947.86]  NCIX, DVI, VGA, something like that.
[4947.86 --> 4948.86]  I think they're...
[4948.86 --> 4949.86]  Yup.
[4949.86 --> 4951.86]  Display interfaces round up with 163,000 views.
[4951.86 --> 4956.86]  I talk about all the differences and all the different display technologies.
[4956.86 --> 4957.86]  Uh...
[4957.86 --> 4960.86]  Brendan, can you suggest a microphone for game commentary?
[4960.86 --> 4963.86]  I hear a lot about some snowball thing, but I've never actually used it.
[4963.86 --> 4970.86]  Jordan, you are forgiven for insulting how short I am.
[4970.86 --> 4977.86]  I'm in the market for a good laptop and I'm thinking of getting a MacBook Pro, but they're extremely expensive.
[4977.86 --> 4980.86]  Yes, they are expensive, but they are good laptops.
[4980.86 --> 4984.86]  Lewis, yes, this is madness.
[4984.86 --> 4986.86]  Tyrone asks if I've ever been to jail.
[4986.86 --> 4987.86]  No, I have not, actually.
[4987.86 --> 4988.86]  Um...
[4988.86 --> 4991.86]  That's a very strange question.
[4991.86 --> 4993.86]  Have you seen the leap motion?
[4993.86 --> 4996.86]  I vaguely remember something about it, but I'm sorry.
[4996.86 --> 4999.86]  What are your thoughts on the Vulcans versus the 7H?
[4999.86 --> 5000.86]  Um...
[5000.86 --> 5001.86]  Vulcans are awesome.
[5001.86 --> 5003.86]  The noise cancellation is outstanding.
[5003.86 --> 5007.86]  The Vulcans are the closest to the 7H that I have yet encountered.
[5007.86 --> 5008.86]  They're awesome.
[5008.86 --> 5009.86]  They're a little bit heavy.
[5009.86 --> 5012.86]  I personally find them not as comfortable as the 7Hs.
[5012.86 --> 5016.86]  The audio quality is not quite as good, but the sound isolation is amazing.
[5016.86 --> 5017.86]  It's outstanding.
[5017.86 --> 5019.86]  Very good product.
[5019.86 --> 5020.86]  Um...
[5020.86 --> 5024.86]  Angel, you can donate your MacBook Pro to me.
[5024.86 --> 5025.86]  I'd love to have a 2010 MacBook Pro.
[5025.86 --> 5029.86]  I'd install Windows on it, mind you, but, you know.
[5029.86 --> 5030.86]  Um...
[5030.86 --> 5033.86]  Dali, what do I use to do my watts up a wall?
[5033.86 --> 5034.86]  I use a little power meter.
[5034.86 --> 5035.86]  I got it at Canadian Tire.
[5035.86 --> 5037.86]  It was like 30 bucks.
[5037.86 --> 5038.86]  Um...
[5038.86 --> 5041.86]  What reservoir are you using?
[5041.86 --> 5044.86]  I'm using a T-Virus reservoir for my personal rig.
[5044.86 --> 5045.86]  Um...
[5045.86 --> 5050.86]  No, I'm not planning to be at the Radion Extravalanza, but you guys should definitely check it out.
[5050.86 --> 5053.86]  So, it's AMD Extravalanza.
[5053.86 --> 5055.86]  It's gonna be in Toronto.
[5055.86 --> 5059.86]  I think it's actually at the AMD headquarters, which is kinda cool, so you can check that out.
[5059.86 --> 5061.86]  So, it's there on Facebook.
[5061.86 --> 5062.86]  You can attend.
[5062.86 --> 5064.86]  I think it looks like 50 people are going.
[5064.86 --> 5065.86]  Um...
[5065.86 --> 5066.86]  Crazy Russian will be there.
[5066.86 --> 5068.86]  And NCIX Esther will be there.
[5068.86 --> 5072.86]  So, if you guys do go, we will have people there.
[5072.86 --> 5073.86]  Chris Lim!
[5073.86 --> 5075.86]  I remember you!
[5075.86 --> 5078.86]  Trial cameraman from the Zyxel videos.
[5078.86 --> 5079.86]  Hope to see you again soon.
[5079.86 --> 5081.86]  I'm planning to be Esther's new cameraman.
[5081.86 --> 5082.86]  That's awesome!
[5082.86 --> 5083.86]  Oh!
[5083.86 --> 5084.86]  That's...
[5084.86 --> 5085.86]  You know what's funny?
[5085.86 --> 5088.86]  I actually went through all of the...
[5088.86 --> 5089.86]  Uh...
[5089.86 --> 5090.86]  Um...
[5090.86 --> 5092.86]  Esther was asking me for some advice on finding...
[5092.86 --> 5093.86]  Uh...
[5093.86 --> 5094.86]  Finding an assistant.
[5094.86 --> 5095.86]  And I was like, oh, okay.
[5095.86 --> 5096.86]  Well, here's all of the applications I received.
[5096.86 --> 5097.86]  And I...
[5097.86 --> 5099.86]  I actually saw your application I was going through.
[5099.86 --> 5102.86]  And I was like, oh, yeah, you know, maybe I should give her these and see if she wants
[5102.86 --> 5104.86]  to get in touch with some of these guys.
[5104.86 --> 5107.86]  Cause these are the guys that I already filtered down to be like the best of the best.
[5107.86 --> 5111.86]  And, uh, everyone I interviewed was outstanding to be perfectly honest.
[5111.86 --> 5112.86]  But, uh...
[5112.86 --> 5113.86]  Hey!
[5113.86 --> 5114.86]  That's awesome!
[5114.86 --> 5115.86]  Hi Chris!
[5115.86 --> 5117.86]  Chris, I actually interviewed for Slick's position.
[5117.86 --> 5118.86]  But Slick, uh...
[5118.86 --> 5119.86]  Slick won out for...
[5119.86 --> 5120.86]  You know, and it was...
[5120.86 --> 5121.86]  Honestly, it was really close.
[5121.86 --> 5122.86]  It was like...
[5122.86 --> 5124.86]  I was...
[5124.86 --> 5125.86]  I...
[5125.86 --> 5128.86]  It was really hard making some of the calls for the people that I thought were...
[5128.86 --> 5129.86]  Were really good.
[5129.86 --> 5130.86]  And I couldn't, uh...
[5130.86 --> 5131.86]  I couldn't hire them.
[5131.86 --> 5133.86]  John, my favorite switches are blues.
[5133.86 --> 5136.86]  However, they're a little bit loud for my living situation with a baby.
[5136.86 --> 5138.86]  So I'm using Blacks right now.
[5138.86 --> 5141.86]  For my favorite mechanical switches.
[5141.86 --> 5142.86]  Um...
[5142.86 --> 5145.86]  Not a big fan of the Razer Black Widow keyboards.
[5145.86 --> 5146.86]  Um...
[5146.86 --> 5147.86]  They're great on paper, but I...
[5147.86 --> 5148.86]  Just using them.
[5148.86 --> 5149.86]  Keyboards are so personal.
[5149.86 --> 5152.86]  Don't like the travel distance, and I don't like the overall feel of the keyboard.
[5152.86 --> 5154.86]  Not my favorite.
[5154.86 --> 5156.86]  Alright...
[5156.86 --> 5159.86]  You know what?
[5159.86 --> 5162.86]  I think we're gonna have to call it quits for tonight, guys.
[5162.86 --> 5163.86]  Thank you!
[5163.86 --> 5164.86]  So much!
[5164.86 --> 5165.86]  To all...
[5165.86 --> 5167.86]  This is one of my best turnouts yet.
[5167.86 --> 5169.86]  Over 1800 people tuned in tonight.
[5169.86 --> 5171.86]  Thank you so much for watching.
[5171.86 --> 5175.86]  And I hope you guys have enjoyed the improved video quality.
[5175.86 --> 5176.86]  And the...
[5176.86 --> 5177.86]  Is the audio quality better tonight?
[5177.86 --> 5178.86]  Like is it...
[5178.86 --> 5179.86]  Is it good?
[5179.86 --> 5180.86]  Is it really good?
[5180.86 --> 5181.86]  I hope so.
[5181.86 --> 5182.86]  I hope you guys have enjoyed it.
[5182.86 --> 5183.86]  I have...
[5183.86 --> 5184.86]  I...
[5184.86 --> 5185.86]  I want you guys to know this.
[5185.86 --> 5186.86]  That camera...
[5186.86 --> 5187.86]  This is my wallet.
[5187.86 --> 5189.86]  This is where the camera and the audio gear came from.
[5189.86 --> 5193.86]  I am serious about improving the quality of everything that we do.
[5193.86 --> 5195.86]  I know that it's...
[5195.86 --> 5196.86]  You know...
[5196.86 --> 5197.86]  Gonna take time.
[5197.86 --> 5199.86]  But I hope you guys are gonna stick with me.
[5199.86 --> 5200.86]  Keep watching.
[5200.86 --> 5201.86]  Stay subscribed.
[5201.86 --> 5202.86]  Spread the word.
[5202.86 --> 5203.86]  Tune into the live streams.
[5203.86 --> 5204.86]  It means a lot to me.
[5204.86 --> 5205.86]  And...
[5205.86 --> 5206.86]  Good night everyone.
[5206.86 --> 5207.86]  Oh.
[5207.86 --> 5220.86]  I didn't manage to turn it off yet.
[5220.86 --> 5221.86]  Fail.
