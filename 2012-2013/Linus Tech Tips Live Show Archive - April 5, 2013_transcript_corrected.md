[0.00 → 7.00] Welcome to the Linus Tech Tips live stream you guys.
[7.00 → 11.16] Thank you for joining us and I feel joining us again because the odds are
[11.16 → 14.88] seem pretty excellent that well a lot of you at least a thousand of you had
[14.88 → 19.72] already joined us for our pre-test. Now I can promise no technical difficulties
[19.72 → 24.24] tonight because I can pretty much promise that there will be something
[24.24 → 30.00] because we're going to have as promised Ryan Shout from PC Perspective joining
[30.00 → 33.42] us through Skype we already know that he's not going to be able to join us
[33.42 → 39.22] through video because for some reason video calls between our streaming machine
[39.22 → 50.10] and him are not working at all so yeah that's like not so good yeah so if
[50.10 → 54.66] nothing else we'll have a little avatar of Ryan right here and then hopefully we'll
[54.66 → 59.40] be able to use the Blue Yeti mic here to get audio from Ryan and then this audio
[59.40 → 62.82] to get audio to you guys if not we could be like one of those ancient
[62.82 → 67.20] school radio shows where it's like you ask a question, and then it like goes to
[67.20 → 72.24] the reporter in the field and the guy's just like okay I think that's probably a
[72.24 → 77.54] TV show not a radio show but oh I meant yeah you know even on like even CBC even
[77.54 → 81.90] like five six seven years ago they still had that where you'd see them kind of
[81.90 → 86.82] going like oh they're waiting for the great question Tom just let me go ahead and answer
[86.82 → 89.82] that for you, it's like even if you connected through cell you should be
[89.82 → 97.62] fine come on could that work if we call him over a cell phone no because how are
[97.62 → 102.30] they going to hear his audio yeah that's the challenge and I actually have no
[102.30 → 107.62] idea how that's gonna work but we did test a Skype call on our own we could have no mic
[107.62 → 113.34] plugged in right watch the stream right or you could talk to him on a cell phone we
[113.34 → 118.26] could have no mic plugged in, and he could answer through Skype I mean yeah I may end
[118.26 → 123.36] up being what we do so we've got a huge agenda for you guys tonight we've got our
[123.36 → 128.64] special guest we've got the Bios hock Infinite audio quality difference on PC and
[128.64 → 132.66] console the new Android technology providing info while pausing video or
[132.66 → 144.88] music uh OUA appears to be um a bit of a fiasco oh yeah oh yeah uh new Blackberry alerts
[144.88 → 151.50] might be telling your friends that it's uh happy time so that's a big problem it's probably oh no
[151.50 → 154.62] that's not the worst thing that's happened on the stream what is the worst thing that's happened
[154.62 → 159.40] on the stream you said you were going to throw a bottle of something at me oh yeah that was gross
[159.40 → 166.84] um in-game footage versus pre-rendered cinematic show I got scammed on v bulletin 5 and how that ties
[166.84 → 172.96] into people getting scammed on games that they're showing cinematic we'll get into oh trust me we're
[172.96 → 177.14] getting into that we're gonna we're going to try and yeah stop ourselves from hurting yeah things hurting
[177.14 → 182.84] like each other and ourselves in our rage yeah um Facebook phone images start to surface so uh the
[182.84 → 189.20] rumour is HTC is the OEM Disney shuts down LucasArts the military robot jellyfish that will rule the
[189.20 → 194.48] world um, and then we've got some Linus Tech Tips news items including a wind force cool GTX Titan
[194.48 → 202.34] Unreal 4 engine comparison with PS4 versus PC and hybrid memory cubes which are looking like they're
[202.34 → 208.48] going to be 15 times better than DDR3 fascinating we've actually got two build logs of the week this
[208.48 → 214.40] week yep, yep so what I was I got some feedback from some community members, and they're saying okay
[214.40 → 221.30] build logs are ridiculously high-end sometimes sponsored a lot of times out of reach of most of
[221.30 → 225.22] the community members on the forum and that was kind of true a lot of them were pretty elaborate
[225.22 → 232.42] build logs so what we're doing is one like kind of insane level build with um hardware requirements that
[232.42 → 237.20] a lot of people won't have access to, so things like CNC machines or incredible amounts of money or
[237.20 → 243.50] things like that, and then we're going to do a more like that's just awesome level build, so I don't
[243.50 → 249.82] want to spoil it, but we've got two really awesome builds this week one kind of insane high-end required
[249.82 → 255.92] a lot of ridiculously custom work with some really impressive nice tooling and then one like you could
[255.92 → 262.50] go do it if you had the inspiration and had the original idea, but this guy actually did so yeah
[262.50 → 268.94] all right, so why don't we get into our first uh our first topic I guess we don't have it open on
[268.94 → 274.16] there necessarily yet so we can't really we can't really show the screenshot, so why don't you talk
[274.16 → 278.42] about it let's do uh bios hock infinite audio quality, and I'll bring it up on the screen okay
[278.42 → 281.88] bios hock infinite audio quality this green you'll have to hear it through this and that might be
[281.88 → 286.90] sketchy because you're hearing audio through another yeah it's okay we'll just we'll give them the link
[286.90 → 290.12] and you can check it on yourself but bios hock infinite they should be able to hear it
[290.12 → 294.52] yeah you're in well though I tested it yeah it should be good okay so guys we're gonna we're
[294.52 → 298.80] gonna play this for you about how long is if it's pretty long and there's like an intro and stuff
[298.80 → 301.78] but you might be able to skip to the part where it actually plays okay I'll get you to handle that
[301.78 → 306.42] so guys we're going to open this up and uh I saw it once a week ago so hopefully I remember oh there's an
[306.42 → 311.54] ad wow the ad was two seconds long that's weird that's the very best type of it oh man it's the same
[311.54 → 317.22] all time is it okay there's a comparison video one thing that I 1080p that affects audio bit rates
[317.22 → 320.50] that's going to be really good yeah
[320.50 → 329.42] okay pc version oh yeah here you can skip around, so then there's uh pc version
[329.42 → 331.16] okay
[331.16 → 339.72] this next clip is on the Xbox 360 in the exact same position yeah someone just knocked on the garage
[339.72 → 344.54] why don't I go find out what's going on um in the meantime let's talk about the uh new android
[344.54 → 351.14] are you gonna yeah I'll go find out who that is okay what am I supposed to talk about new android tech
[351.14 → 355.74] new android okay so android you should probably check the crotch
[355.74 → 361.64] oh I can't open if it's disconnected okay whatever um so android is releasing a new thing I don't know
[361.64 → 366.88] if it's out already I haven't been able to you should probably go get that yes yes
[366.88 → 373.76] I haven't been able to replicate this um on my own, but apparently android is releasing a new thing
[373.76 → 379.20] can they see this yeah okay so as you can see here the guy paused the video with Jack Black on the screen
[379.20 → 383.70] right there, and then it gives you information about Jack Black on the right what movies he's been in whom
[383.70 → 389.50] he is his age all that kind of stuff this is supposed to work for movies this is also supposed to work
[389.50 → 395.70] for music, so I think the idea is you can be watching pretty much anything pause it and get tons of
[395.70 → 399.40] different information I think that's really, really cool because if you're watching a movie and you
[399.40 → 404.06] really like one of the actors you can see the actor list at the end it might not actually be clear
[404.06 → 408.76] enough for you to figure out who it is so this way you can just pause it while it's live and there's
[408.76 → 414.26] some cool information I don't know that's pretty cool um let's move on what else was there to talk
[414.26 → 420.54] about oh yeah back to bios hock infinite because we didn't actually really get to see that that well
[420.54 → 424.58] um you should check out that video I'll post a link about it on my twitter or somewhere later on or
[424.58 → 433.38] maybe I'll get one of the mods to post it up later um what um, so this is probably the most surreal
[433.38 → 440.70] experience that I've had in a while um I'm just going to go ahead and sort of steal the street the uh
[440.70 → 446.44] so uh you know like those pranks where people order pizza and send it to your house, and you're like
[446.44 → 452.98] I didn't order any pizza um so someone actually not well not just anyone hold on here I'm going to go
[452.98 → 457.84] ahead, and I'm going to let you read out the note it took me and I didn't realize you can order pizza
[457.84 → 465.94] for someone and uh what oh it's the red yeah please knock on garage door could you also write
[465.94 → 469.14] on the box with love the mod team
[469.14 → 482.30] so they sent us a medium pizza with Italian thin crust, and they removed mozzarella and pepperoni and
[482.30 → 489.10] oh wait no they removed mozzarella and added pepperoni and Italian sausage and um beautiful
[489.10 → 496.42] I mean okay they got it almost right because we didn't order anything else
[496.42 → 500.76] so we wanted pizza to come with something we didn't order anything but
[500.76 → 501.52] oh okay
[501.52 → 505.24] um thank you very much guys
[505.24 → 509.54] that was actually fantastic
[509.54 → 513.02] yeah have we ever actually been properly trolled on the live stream before
[513.02 → 514.92] um other than the drunk guy
[514.92 → 516.06] you called me once
[516.06 → 517.46] I was helping you though
[517.46 → 518.78] you were well you were trying to help
[518.78 → 519.08] your stream was broken
[519.08 → 521.06] you're okay that's probably true
[521.06 → 526.58] well one way or another I'm going to let you take over and keep talking about this, and I'm gonna
[526.58 → 529.32] I finished talking about that actually I jumped back to Bios hock
[529.32 → 532.18] so we should find out if this pizza is any good at least
[532.18 → 533.50] here you go
[533.50 → 535.44] they put like everything on it
[535.44 → 536.60] here have a piece
[536.60 → 540.44] hopefully you guys will excuse us for eating on the live stream because our forum
[540.44 → 543.22] moderation team has sent us pizza
[543.22 → 549.10] which apparently made him throw up
[549.10 → 553.02] really you don't like it
[553.02 → 560.06] it all came off
[560.06 → 562.68] it's too hot, so the cheese just kept going
[562.68 → 563.88] mm-hmm
[563.88 → 565.06] that is a problem
[565.06 → 568.08] what did they put on there?
[568.08 → 569.64] I am actually not sure
[569.64 → 571.12] what tastes really weird
[571.12 → 572.60] add pepper
[572.60 → 573.20] oysters
[573.20 → 574.56] oh oysters
[574.56 → 577.94] that is a unique pizza
[577.94 → 579.00] so this is uh
[579.00 → 580.72] I was like what is that?
[580.72 → 585.52] it does have a bit of a does have a bit of an oyster taste to it so
[585.52 → 587.12] remove mozzarella
[587.12 → 588.76] add pepperoni
[588.76 → 589.96] add Italian sausage
[589.96 → 591.08] add green pepper
[591.08 → 593.12] um add oysters
[593.12 → 594.96] and add blend
[594.96 → 596.70] I think blend is cheese
[596.70 → 597.86] blend is cheese
[597.86 → 601.62] that is some of the weirdest tasting pizza I think I've ever had
[601.62 → 602.02] yeah
[602.02 → 602.78] yeah it is
[602.78 → 604.14] so um
[604.14 → 608.24] thank you mod team
[608.24 → 609.68] um
[609.68 → 614.58] I'm just lost now
[614.58 → 616.44] so take over on Bios hock Infinite
[616.44 → 618.44] where was I?
[618.84 → 619.32] um
[619.32 → 622.02] okay so in the video you have to watch it in 1080p
[622.02 → 624.42] because that does actually increase audio bitrate on YouTube
[624.42 → 626.32] so if you're going to watch the video
[626.32 → 628.52] with which I'll try and release the link at some point
[628.52 → 629.48] um
[629.48 → 631.66] make sure you actually do watch it in 1080p
[631.66 → 632.64] that actually does matter
[632.64 → 633.54] um
[633.54 → 636.70] and there's a noticeable audio difference between PC and console
[636.70 → 639.40] which is kind of weird
[639.40 → 640.50] um
[640.50 → 643.86] yeah like I can imagine there being a video quality difference
[643.86 → 644.54] in fact we
[644.54 → 646.76] well I mean if there wasn't a video quality difference
[646.76 → 648.54] then they probably broke their computer somehow
[648.54 → 648.86] but
[648.86 → 649.46] yeah
[649.46 → 650.24] um
[650.24 → 652.30] but apparently this is repeatable
[652.30 → 653.42] I read around a little
[653.42 → 654.34] a little bit about it
[654.34 → 657.10] the only guy that I could actually see showing a real review about it
[657.10 → 658.08] was the one that I got in
[658.08 → 660.08] as a link here
[660.08 → 661.78] but I'm sure there's probably more now
[661.78 → 664.56] because I jumped on this like right after Bios hock was released
[664.56 → 664.94] right
[664.94 → 666.90] um then I haven't looked into it since then
[666.90 → 667.76] because I've been working a lot of time
[667.76 → 668.46] um
[668.46 → 671.54] dealing with forum issues V Bolton
[671.54 → 672.58] anyway
[672.58 → 673.48] yeah more on that later
[673.48 → 675.08] um
[675.08 → 675.46] yeah
[675.46 → 675.94] so
[675.94 → 677.32] interesting
[677.32 → 678.88] another reason to play on PC
[678.88 → 680.46] although I don't understand why
[680.46 → 681.52] but I
[681.52 → 682.26] that's cool
[682.26 → 683.16] but like
[683.16 → 684.52] okay
[684.52 → 686.80] had some pretty awesome audio come from games on consoles before
[686.80 → 687.76] I don't understand
[687.76 → 689.16] why that matters
[689.16 → 689.56] but
[689.56 → 691.64] but there is a very noticeable difference
[691.64 → 692.36] so if you check that out
[692.36 → 692.98] it's pretty interesting
[692.98 → 694.78] okay
[694.78 → 696.62] so we've got about 15 minutes
[696.62 → 698.62] so why don't we talk about OUA
[698.62 → 700.34] and then do some Twitter Q&A
[700.34 → 701.96] so guys get your Twitter questions in
[701.96 → 702.54] uh
[702.54 → 704.72] if you haven't heard of OUA already
[704.72 → 705.82] it is
[705.82 → 706.24] uh
[706.24 → 706.46] well
[706.46 → 707.58] it promised to be
[707.58 → 708.02] it was one
[708.02 → 709.64] it was a record-breaking Kickstarter
[709.64 → 710.98] so here we go
[710.98 → 712.24] I'm just going to open this up for you
[712.24 → 714.84] OUA promises improved responsiveness
[714.84 → 716.88] simplified game installations for June retail launch
[716.88 → 717.06] so
[717.06 → 719.28] it was a record-breaking Kickstarter
[719.28 → 720.36] they destroyed
[720.36 → 721.68] their target
[721.68 → 723.14] it was intended to be
[723.14 → 724.16] a small
[724.16 → 725.02] sleek
[725.02 → 726.30] Android-based
[726.30 → 726.92] gaming
[726.92 → 727.90] device
[727.90 → 730.36] that was looking to go up against
[730.36 → 732.24] bigger consoles for room
[732.24 → 733.28] in your home theatre
[733.28 → 734.32] and
[734.32 → 735.70] the idea was
[735.70 → 736.94] Android has
[736.94 → 737.48] oh
[737.48 → 738.60] this is your sleep
[738.60 → 739.26] your Skype
[739.26 → 740.56] the idea is that
[740.56 → 741.48] Android has
[741.48 → 742.10] a mature
[742.10 → 743.16] gaming platform
[743.16 → 744.04] in terms of
[744.04 → 744.56] the
[744.56 → 746.04] library of games
[746.04 → 746.64] that are available
[746.64 → 748.54] in terms of compatibility of games
[748.54 → 749.56] so they were going to go
[749.56 → 749.82] okay
[749.82 → 750.22] well here
[750.22 → 751.32] we're going to give you like
[751.32 → 751.98] a controller
[751.98 → 753.44] so you can enjoy those games
[753.44 → 754.06] on your couch
[754.06 → 755.52] without some of the
[755.52 → 756.54] sludgier solutions
[756.54 → 757.80] that involve doing things
[757.80 → 758.48] like plugging
[758.48 → 760.20] micro HDMI cables
[760.20 → 761.78] into your
[761.78 → 762.98] you know
[762.98 → 763.56] your tablet
[763.56 → 765.40] and then running a long
[765.40 → 766.52] sort of like a
[766.52 → 767.44] what are you going to do
[767.44 → 769.22] micro HDMI into your tablet
[769.22 → 770.62] wireless controller
[770.62 → 771.80] to your tablet
[771.80 → 773.28] and then like to run a cable
[773.28 → 774.02] to the back of your
[774.02 → 774.68] like come on
[774.68 → 775.10] who does that
[775.10 → 775.40] then you'd have to
[775.40 → 775.98] charge it
[775.98 → 777.30] there's like the four people
[777.30 → 777.94] because it's going to die
[777.94 → 778.56] in like ten minutes
[778.56 → 778.94] who do that
[778.94 → 780.12] well there are docks
[780.12 → 780.86] right
[780.86 → 782.08] you can get docks
[782.08 → 784.08] and all 12 people
[784.08 → 784.72] who bought a dock
[784.72 → 785.34] for their tablet
[785.34 → 786.76] are probably really offended
[786.76 → 788.02] that I think that it's so unrealistic
[788.02 → 788.68] right now
[788.68 → 790.96] but let's face it
[790.96 → 791.74] no one was going to do that
[791.74 → 792.62] so the idea was to have
[792.62 → 793.28] an inexpensive
[793.28 → 794.34] $99.99
[794.34 → 795.64] $100 box
[795.64 → 796.58] that you could have
[796.58 → 797.66] as an Android based
[797.66 → 798.32] game console
[798.32 → 799.94] they promised the world
[799.94 → 800.86] they were going to have
[800.86 → 802.38] hardware that was going to be
[802.38 → 803.32] you know
[803.32 → 804.42] upgraded over time
[804.42 → 805.18] it was going to be
[805.18 → 805.76] responsive
[805.76 → 806.94] it was going to be awesome
[806.94 → 808.40] but I think
[808.40 → 809.20] it should have been
[809.20 → 810.12] fairly obvious
[810.12 → 811.88] that $99.99
[811.88 → 813.48] wasn't enough
[813.48 → 814.66] to deliver on this promise
[814.66 → 816.48] and there's a
[816.48 → 817.56] fair bit of backlash
[817.56 → 818.78] that's going on
[818.78 → 819.48] as it
[819.48 → 820.38] approaches
[820.38 → 822.28] a large scale
[822.28 → 823.14] retail launch
[823.14 → 823.94] that
[823.94 → 826.06] I think the people
[826.06 → 827.14] who kickstarted
[827.14 → 827.58] the project
[827.58 → 828.12] are feeling like
[828.12 → 828.48] they're not getting
[828.48 → 829.00] their money's worth
[829.00 → 829.84] yeah
[829.84 → 831.48] one thing
[831.48 → 832.14] from the reviews
[832.14 → 832.90] is that everything's
[832.90 → 833.34] still in like
[833.34 → 833.80] pretty beta
[833.80 → 835.64] I personally think
[835.64 → 836.34] they maybe should have
[836.34 → 836.92] waited longer
[836.92 → 837.68] but I think
[837.68 → 838.60] they may have
[838.60 → 839.36] like
[839.36 → 840.50] locked into a launch
[840.50 → 840.72] date
[840.72 → 842.00] when they made
[842.00 → 842.50] their kickstarter
[842.50 → 843.48] and the problem
[843.48 → 844.38] with launching
[844.38 → 844.68] okay
[844.68 → 845.50] two problems
[845.50 → 846.30] so the problem
[846.30 → 846.80] with locking
[846.80 → 847.38] in a launch
[847.38 → 847.66] date
[847.66 → 848.98] is that
[848.98 → 851.86] you might launch
[851.86 → 852.58] before you're ready
[852.58 → 853.52] and the problem
[853.52 → 854.32] with not locking
[854.32 → 855.02] in a launch date
[855.02 → 855.64] is that you might
[855.64 → 856.54] end up in a situation
[856.54 → 857.52] where the hardware
[857.52 → 858.44] that you've spent
[858.44 → 859.12] all this money
[859.12 → 859.62] developing
[859.62 → 861.54] is completely
[861.54 → 862.62] freaking obsolete
[862.62 → 863.70] and totally useless
[863.70 → 864.96] by the time it
[864.96 → 866.00] ever reaches market
[866.00 → 867.82] I mean
[867.82 → 868.34] who can we
[868.34 → 868.80] who can we
[868.80 → 869.36] really like
[869.36 → 870.22] point at
[870.22 → 871.22] who did that
[871.22 → 872.76] I don't know
[872.76 → 873.64] I know there's a few
[873.64 → 874.40] I just can't think of them
[874.40 → 875.48] it's happened a number
[875.48 → 875.96] of times
[875.96 → 876.78] where it's a
[876.78 → 877.16] it's like
[877.16 → 878.46] it's a complicated project
[878.46 → 879.38] that involves a lot
[879.38 → 880.28] of software and hardware
[880.28 → 881.32] that has to work together
[881.32 → 882.56] and then by the time
[882.56 → 883.56] it actually reaches the market
[883.56 → 883.98] there's something
[883.98 → 884.42] that's cheaper
[884.42 → 884.78] and better
[884.78 → 885.30] and faster
[885.30 → 886.46] so OUA
[886.46 → 887.34] is going to be
[887.34 → 888.56] running up against
[888.56 → 889.84] a Terra 4 launch
[889.84 → 891.28] which is going to mean
[891.28 → 891.92] there are going to be
[891.92 → 892.50] phones
[892.50 → 893.26] that are going to
[893.26 → 894.46] perform better than OUA
[894.46 → 896.00] and with standards
[896.00 → 897.08] like wireless HDMI
[897.08 → 898.32] becoming lower latency
[898.32 → 899.04] all the time
[899.04 → 900.60] I mean depending on
[900.60 → 901.18] the kind of games
[901.18 → 901.54] you're playing
[901.54 → 902.20] would I be playing
[902.20 → 903.18] a Twitch first person
[903.18 → 903.52] shooter
[903.52 → 904.52] no
[904.52 → 905.96] would I be playing
[905.96 → 906.76] a Twitch first person
[906.76 → 907.64] shooter on an Android
[907.64 → 908.28] device anyway
[908.28 → 909.34] no
[909.34 → 910.68] one thing is emulators
[910.68 → 912.42] okay yes
[912.42 → 914.00] and emulators are a big deal
[914.00 → 914.92] but on the other hand
[914.92 → 916.42] even playing natively
[916.42 → 917.56] on the same device
[917.56 → 918.42] without even a wireless
[918.42 → 918.94] controller
[918.94 → 920.04] I haven't found an emulator
[920.04 → 920.92] that will allow me to play
[920.92 → 921.66] Super Mario World
[921.66 → 922.32] reasonably well
[922.32 → 922.62] so
[922.62 → 923.98] not really
[923.98 → 924.90] and like
[924.90 → 927.62] it's still a newer TV
[927.62 → 928.70] you're not going to go
[928.70 → 929.90] HDMI to an old enough TV
[929.90 → 930.50] where it'll
[930.50 → 932.60] yeah HDMI to CRT
[932.60 → 933.32] I mean that's not even
[933.32 → 933.94] the problem though
[933.94 → 934.74] there's enough latency
[934.74 → 935.90] in the emulator itself
[935.90 → 936.38] no I know
[936.38 → 936.78] I know
[936.78 → 938.14] I mean maybe Terra 4
[938.14 → 939.10] will address it
[939.10 → 940.08] but even then
[940.08 → 941.10] you've got the latency
[941.10 → 941.90] of emulation
[941.90 → 943.34] Terra 4 not Terra 3
[943.34 → 944.18] we're still dealing
[944.18 → 945.06] with Terra 3
[945.06 → 945.60] it's new yeah
[945.60 → 945.96] right
[945.96 → 946.84] right right right
[946.84 → 947.04] right
[947.04 → 947.48] so
[947.48 → 947.94] it's just kind of
[947.94 → 949.12] in an awkward spot
[949.12 → 950.18] and it's release time
[950.18 → 951.22] is at an awkward spot
[951.22 → 952.04] that they probably
[952.04 → 952.52] wouldn't have been
[952.52 → 953.18] able to know about
[953.18 → 954.04] so it's just
[954.04 → 955.54] awkward spot
[955.54 → 956.46] over awkward spot
[956.46 → 956.92] and then they
[956.92 → 958.46] threw beta stuff
[958.46 → 959.20] out to reviewers
[959.20 → 960.36] and then that didn't go well
[960.36 → 960.94] because reviewers
[960.94 → 961.46] aren't going to fight
[961.46 → 962.16] with it for that long
[962.16 → 963.02] no they're not
[963.02 → 963.52] if you're just going to
[963.52 → 963.82] plug it in
[963.82 → 964.34] it's not going to work
[964.34 → 964.82] and they're going to be like
[964.82 → 965.28] lol
[965.28 → 966.96] and so many Android games
[966.96 → 968.14] I mean part of it is that
[968.14 → 969.46] while it's ready
[969.46 → 970.76] to be a more
[970.76 → 973.08] mainstream gaming platform
[973.08 → 974.16] in terms of the breadth
[974.16 → 974.86] of games available
[974.86 → 976.00] how many of those games
[976.00 → 976.86] are actually designed
[976.86 → 977.54] to be sat and played
[977.54 → 978.18] with a controller
[978.18 → 980.14] but percentage wise
[980.14 → 982.16] less than 50 for sure
[982.16 → 982.90] not the actual
[982.90 → 984.54] probably less than 20%
[984.54 → 985.82] are actually intended
[985.82 → 986.42] to be played
[986.42 → 988.10] with that kind of controller
[988.10 → 988.66] and I mean
[988.66 → 989.86] the promise was
[989.86 → 990.96] oh well it'll be hackable
[990.96 → 991.62] so you know
[991.62 → 992.48] the emulation crowd
[992.48 → 993.56] is going to be big into that
[993.56 → 996.10] but as hackable as it is
[996.10 → 997.28] if it's not a satisfactory
[997.28 → 998.42] gaming experience
[998.42 → 998.84] then
[998.84 → 1000.38] there's already
[1000.38 → 1001.26] like there's already a group
[1001.26 → 1002.38] that came out with a
[1002.38 → 1003.48] OUA compatible
[1003.48 → 1005.28] N64 kind of controller thing
[1005.28 → 1006.32] that's pretty cool
[1006.32 → 1007.16] that's pretty cool
[1007.16 → 1008.08] they kickstarted as well
[1008.08 → 1009.12] I don't know if they made it
[1009.12 → 1010.64] but I saw them on Kickstarter
[1010.64 → 1011.58] I know they kickstarted as well
[1011.58 → 1012.64] and like stuff like that's cool
[1012.64 → 1013.60] and I'm interested
[1013.60 → 1014.62] if it's their own OS
[1014.62 → 1015.62] planned obsolescence
[1015.62 → 1016.64] probably isn't going to be
[1016.64 → 1018.68] quite as intense
[1018.68 → 1019.78] right okay
[1019.78 → 1021.66] so maybe it'll be able
[1021.66 → 1022.98] to last as like
[1022.98 → 1024.80] I think the whole thing
[1024.80 → 1025.28] is going to bounce
[1025.28 → 1025.78] on emulation
[1025.78 → 1027.44] because new Android games
[1027.44 → 1028.00] are going to be focused
[1028.00 → 1028.52] on Terra 4
[1028.52 → 1029.28] yep
[1029.28 → 1030.28] harnessing Terra 4
[1030.28 → 1031.02] so boom
[1031.02 → 1031.46] OUA's done
[1031.46 → 1032.26] NVIDIA's going to push
[1032.26 → 1033.20] so hard for that
[1033.20 → 1033.68] of course
[1033.68 → 1034.10] yeah
[1034.10 → 1035.08] so that's brutal
[1035.08 → 1036.84] but if OUA can actually
[1036.84 → 1038.28] capture and harness
[1038.28 → 1039.34] the emulation crowd
[1039.34 → 1041.46] that might kind of work
[1041.46 → 1042.52] because if you can buy
[1042.52 → 1043.60] for 99 bucks
[1043.60 → 1044.58] plus a controller
[1044.58 → 1045.44] so like
[1045.44 → 1046.72] I'm guessing 120
[1046.72 → 1047.54] 130 bucks
[1047.54 → 1047.80] yeah
[1047.80 → 1048.96] a console that you
[1048.96 → 1049.36] and your buddy
[1049.36 → 1049.92] can sit down
[1049.92 → 1050.94] and play old school games on
[1050.94 → 1051.70] you don't have to
[1051.70 → 1052.46] whip out of your old consoles
[1052.46 → 1053.00] that barely work
[1053.00 → 1053.34] tell you what
[1053.34 → 1054.04] I'm going to go ahead
[1054.04 → 1055.08] and play devil's advocate here
[1055.08 → 1055.78] and say you could get
[1055.78 → 1056.60] a hundred dollar computer
[1056.60 → 1057.18] on Craigslist
[1057.18 → 1058.12] that'll emulate just fine
[1058.12 → 1058.80] yeah
[1058.80 → 1061.28] my parents old Pentium 4
[1061.28 → 1063.32] with onboard freaking graphics
[1063.32 → 1064.14] Pentium 4
[1064.14 → 1064.88] I'm trying to find reasons
[1064.88 → 1066.74] 2.4 gigahertz
[1066.74 → 1067.42] P4
[1067.42 → 1068.42] P4A
[1068.42 → 1069.00] so we're talking
[1069.00 → 1069.64] Willamette core
[1069.64 → 1070.78] that thing was a piece
[1070.78 → 1071.68] okay
[1071.68 → 1073.74] was able to emulate
[1073.74 → 1074.78] PS1 games
[1074.78 → 1076.42] couldn't do PS2
[1076.42 → 1076.84] but
[1076.84 → 1078.18] I'm willing to
[1078.18 → 1079.40] this will be
[1079.40 → 1080.24] an interesting challenge
[1080.24 → 1081.24] we should see
[1081.24 → 1082.70] if we can go on Craigslist
[1082.70 → 1083.18] or
[1083.18 → 1084.26] Red Flag deals
[1084.26 → 1084.90] or eBay
[1084.90 → 1086.42] and piece together
[1086.42 → 1087.02] the components
[1087.02 → 1087.82] for a computer
[1087.82 → 1088.76] that could emulate
[1088.76 → 1089.52] PS2
[1089.52 → 1090.12] and back
[1090.12 → 1091.92] I've probably got
[1091.92 → 1092.54] stuff at home
[1092.54 → 1093.40] probably doable
[1093.40 → 1094.36] for that kind of price
[1094.36 → 1094.78] though right
[1094.78 → 1095.26] yeah
[1095.26 → 1097.20] so do you want
[1097.20 → 1098.28] an Android based
[1098.28 → 1098.68] device
[1098.68 → 1100.34] where quite frankly
[1100.34 → 1101.06] the emulators
[1101.06 → 1102.04] are not as mature
[1102.04 → 1102.94] as they are on PC
[1102.94 → 1103.26] yep
[1103.26 → 1105.20] on top of that
[1105.20 → 1105.80] I mean PC
[1105.80 → 1106.64] has the
[1106.64 → 1107.58] the flexibility
[1107.58 → 1108.80] of being able
[1108.80 → 1109.72] to not only run
[1109.72 → 1110.86] old school emulated games
[1110.86 → 1111.44] but you could run
[1111.44 → 1112.56] old school PC games
[1112.56 → 1114.12] get yourself a couch master
[1114.12 → 1115.02] with the money
[1115.02 → 1115.66] that you saved
[1115.66 → 1116.72] buying a bunch of
[1116.72 → 1117.16] like
[1117.16 → 1118.92] controllers and accessories
[1118.92 → 1120.02] because let's face it
[1120.02 → 1120.68] any console
[1120.68 → 1121.32] coming to market
[1121.32 → 1122.08] at $99.99
[1122.08 → 1123.12] the intention
[1123.12 → 1123.78] is to make money
[1123.78 → 1124.38] on accessories
[1124.38 → 1125.34] I think
[1125.34 → 1126.14] after
[1126.14 → 1127.78] filling it
[1127.78 → 1128.30] filling it out
[1128.30 → 1128.80] with controllers
[1128.80 → 1129.44] I think it's like
[1129.44 → 1129.70] $200
[1129.70 → 1130.46] right
[1130.46 → 1131.08] I remember
[1131.08 → 1131.74] pricing it out
[1131.74 → 1132.02] because
[1132.02 → 1132.44] okay
[1132.44 → 1133.18] couch master's
[1133.18 → 1133.72] not that cheap
[1133.72 → 1134.00] but
[1134.00 → 1135.10] couch master's so cool
[1135.10 → 1135.68] if you're in Europe
[1135.68 → 1135.88] though
[1135.88 → 1136.64] it's quite a bit
[1136.64 → 1137.56] easier to get your hands on
[1137.56 → 1137.94] that's true
[1137.94 → 1138.62] so couch master
[1138.62 → 1139.14] for you guys
[1139.14 → 1139.56] who don't know
[1139.56 → 1140.22] we did an unboxing
[1140.22 → 1140.80] of it before
[1140.80 → 1141.74] where it's like
[1141.74 → 1142.30] a plank
[1142.30 → 1143.82] with two cushions
[1143.82 → 1145.08] that sits and holds
[1145.08 → 1145.90] a keyboard and mouse
[1145.90 → 1146.72] that doesn't sound
[1146.72 → 1147.44] nearly as awesome
[1147.44 → 1147.96] as it is
[1147.96 → 1148.38] no it's
[1148.38 → 1149.36] it's really awesome
[1149.36 → 1150.06] and it's like
[1150.06 → 1150.48] sturdy
[1150.48 → 1151.26] and it comes with
[1151.26 → 1152.02] an extension cord
[1152.02 → 1152.44] so you can have
[1152.44 → 1153.08] all your peripherals
[1153.08 → 1153.52] and your headset
[1153.52 → 1154.18] everything like
[1154.18 → 1155.14] running off there
[1155.14 → 1156.28] and it's like
[1156.28 → 1157.52] actually awesome
[1157.52 → 1158.38] so
[1158.38 → 1161.28] I don't know
[1161.28 → 1162.30] I would go PC
[1162.30 → 1163.90] I still would too
[1163.90 → 1164.46] I'm just trying to
[1164.46 → 1165.46] find a reason for it
[1165.46 → 1165.98] and like
[1165.98 → 1166.26] okay
[1166.26 → 1167.36] to give some context
[1167.36 → 1168.22] I'm kind of crazy
[1168.22 → 1168.74] into Kickstarter
[1168.74 → 1169.54] I'm on there
[1169.54 → 1170.74] pretty much every single day
[1170.74 → 1171.18] and I've spent
[1171.18 → 1171.82] too much money
[1171.82 → 1174.22] I love Kickstarter
[1174.22 → 1174.70] it's cool
[1174.70 → 1175.94] but I did not
[1175.94 → 1176.82] Kickstarter OUA
[1176.82 → 1178.38] because I saw this coming
[1178.38 → 1179.84] how close are we
[1179.84 → 1180.70] to a smart TV
[1180.70 → 1181.42] that just has
[1181.42 → 1182.34] a Terra 4 in it
[1182.34 → 1183.40] or whatever
[1183.40 → 1184.12] the next stage is
[1184.12 → 1184.66] or whatever
[1184.66 → 1185.00] like
[1185.00 → 1185.74] all it takes
[1185.74 → 1186.76] is one
[1186.76 → 1187.86] of the TV makers
[1187.86 → 1189.08] to pull their head
[1189.08 → 1190.12] out of their
[1190.12 → 1191.08] pocketbook
[1191.08 → 1192.10] or something
[1192.10 → 1193.00] outside the
[1193.00 → 1194.54] outside their pocketbook
[1194.54 → 1196.06] that might be
[1196.06 → 1197.24] outside the range
[1197.24 → 1198.66] of a lot of people's
[1198.66 → 1199.56] pocketbooks
[1199.56 → 1200.78] because it might be
[1200.78 → 1201.22] too expensive
[1201.22 → 1202.32] for someone who would be
[1202.32 → 1202.66] in the market
[1202.66 → 1203.78] might be too expensive
[1203.78 → 1204.52] my balls
[1204.52 → 1205.90] because it's not
[1205.90 → 1206.30] that expensive
[1206.30 → 1206.52] okay
[1206.52 → 1207.12] look at someone
[1207.12 → 1207.72] like Samsung
[1207.72 → 1209.04] what do they have
[1209.04 → 1209.36] to get
[1209.36 → 1209.58] okay
[1209.58 → 1210.18] smart TV
[1210.18 → 1210.92] is a huge push
[1210.92 → 1211.28] for them
[1211.28 → 1211.68] yeah
[1211.68 → 1212.38] they actually
[1212.38 → 1213.04] don't need to
[1213.04 → 1214.02] use a Terra processor
[1214.02 → 1214.70] they have their own
[1214.70 → 1215.56] processors that they
[1215.56 → 1216.24] could throw in there
[1216.24 → 1216.92] why
[1216.92 → 1218.20] why don't they
[1218.20 → 1219.80] put a proper Android
[1219.80 → 1220.72] build a tablet
[1220.72 → 1221.36] into their TV
[1221.36 → 1221.90] and then they'll
[1221.90 → 1222.66] probably make it
[1222.66 → 1223.68] a premium price
[1223.68 → 1224.64] well yes
[1224.64 → 1225.60] that's why it's
[1225.60 → 1226.12] probably going to be
[1226.12 → 1226.56] out of the price
[1226.56 → 1227.28] bracket of most people
[1227.28 → 1227.72] it's probably going to be
[1227.72 → 1228.78] an over $2000 TV
[1228.78 → 1230.00] right
[1230.00 → 1230.88] because who cares
[1230.88 → 1231.92] if it's fairly cheap hardware
[1231.92 → 1233.12] you put it in a TV
[1233.12 → 1233.96] no one else has it
[1233.96 → 1234.78] I guess that's pretty much it
[1234.78 → 1235.36] why do we need
[1235.36 → 1236.30] OUA to do this
[1236.30 → 1238.14] I mean all it takes
[1238.14 → 1238.98] is one of those guys
[1238.98 → 1239.50] that's building
[1239.50 → 1240.68] cheap Android sticks
[1240.68 → 1241.92] that you plug in
[1241.92 → 1242.94] via HDMI
[1242.94 → 1245.60] and put a GPU in it
[1245.60 → 1247.02] and you've got an OUA
[1247.02 → 1248.18] because there's nothing
[1248.18 → 1249.42] actually special about it
[1249.42 → 1249.90] other than that
[1249.90 → 1251.02] it has a reasonable spec
[1251.02 → 1251.70] and it's Bluetooth
[1251.70 → 1252.22] and so
[1252.22 → 1253.26] I mean they've
[1253.26 → 1253.66] they've
[1253.66 → 1254.50] they've developed
[1254.50 → 1254.84] there
[1254.84 → 1256.44] they've developed a product
[1256.44 → 1257.54] that's going to lead them
[1257.54 → 1258.88] down the path of
[1258.88 → 1260.20] of easy
[1260.20 → 1261.00] accessibility
[1261.00 → 1262.02] to other things
[1262.02 → 1262.48] that are better
[1262.48 → 1263.04] and faster
[1263.04 → 1265.32] so soon
[1265.32 → 1266.44] that it
[1266.44 → 1267.42] it's going to be relevant
[1267.42 → 1268.32] for like a couple of months
[1268.32 → 1268.96] it's going to be like
[1268.96 → 1271.10] like I almost want to
[1271.10 → 1271.82] compare it to Wii
[1271.82 → 1272.62] where it's like
[1272.62 → 1273.74] really cool for a bit
[1273.74 → 1274.30] and then
[1274.30 → 1275.44] I still liked Wii
[1275.44 → 1276.50] yeah I know
[1276.50 → 1277.42] I actually played Wii
[1277.42 → 1278.56] more than I played PS3
[1278.56 → 1279.44] or Xbox 360
[1279.44 → 1280.18] you need friends
[1280.18 → 1280.84] to enjoy Wii
[1280.84 → 1282.18] I have lots of family members
[1282.18 → 1283.64] so I enjoyed Wii
[1283.64 → 1284.24] with my family
[1284.24 → 1290.30] that's awkward
[1290.30 → 1293.82] hey
[1293.82 → 1294.62] there's nothing
[1294.62 → 1295.38] more bonding
[1295.38 → 1296.50] than like
[1296.50 → 1297.22] peeing together
[1297.22 → 1298.56] so there
[1298.56 → 1300.34] yeah
[1300.34 → 1301.30] I took it there
[1301.30 → 1302.58] oh my goodness
[1302.58 → 1303.20] alright
[1303.20 → 1303.98] let's do some
[1303.98 → 1304.60] let's do some
[1304.60 → 1305.32] Twitter Q&A
[1305.32 → 1305.98] since we're
[1305.98 → 1307.04] apparently due
[1307.04 → 1308.78] OUA needs to be
[1308.78 → 1309.70] a smart TV in a box
[1309.70 → 1310.10] as well
[1310.10 → 1310.44] you know what
[1310.44 → 1310.94] it could be
[1310.94 → 1311.44] you just throw
[1311.44 → 1312.12] Plex on there
[1312.12 → 1312.90] something like that
[1312.90 → 1313.60] I'm sure they could do it
[1313.60 → 1314.14] pretty easily
[1314.14 → 1315.14] yeah I mean it's Android
[1315.14 → 1316.12] so installing
[1316.12 → 1316.82] it's as simple as
[1316.82 → 1317.58] installing apps
[1317.58 → 1318.40] and it could become
[1318.40 → 1319.00] a nice environment
[1319.00 → 1319.82] because it's Android
[1319.82 → 1320.68] so it could become
[1320.68 → 1322.06] like your home theatre
[1322.06 → 1323.00] PC for a hundred bucks
[1323.00 → 1323.24] yep
[1323.24 → 1324.64] and maybe you don't
[1324.64 → 1325.22] want to buy like
[1325.22 → 1325.86] a P4 and everything
[1325.86 → 1326.84] because the box is too big
[1326.84 → 1327.92] and OUA is silent
[1327.92 → 1328.64] as far as I know
[1328.64 → 1329.12] and small
[1329.12 → 1330.12] and looks kind of good
[1330.12 → 1331.08] so it has that kind of
[1331.08 → 1331.78] stuff going for it
[1331.78 → 1333.12] you could stream to it
[1333.12 → 1333.72] from other computers
[1333.72 → 1334.02] in the house
[1334.02 → 1334.68] because it's networkable
[1334.68 → 1335.40] all that kind of stuff
[1335.40 → 1336.10] it's just
[1336.10 → 1337.22] it doesn't seem
[1337.22 → 1338.38] that ridiculously special
[1338.38 → 1339.08] but then it is
[1339.08 → 1340.06] that ridiculously cheap
[1340.06 → 1341.96] how has the Apple TV
[1341.96 → 1342.82] been thus far
[1342.82 → 1343.84] I actually have only
[1343.84 → 1344.92] used it once
[1344.92 → 1346.30] since we filmed the video
[1346.30 → 1347.14] that we needed it for
[1347.14 → 1347.74] it's the only reason
[1347.74 → 1348.28] I got one
[1348.28 → 1350.36] PC per trolled the couch master
[1350.36 → 1351.04] well we'll give Ryan
[1351.04 → 1351.80] a hard time for that
[1351.80 → 1353.20] when he comes on
[1353.20 → 1354.18] CPUs in 10 years
[1354.18 → 1354.76] what are your thoughts
[1354.76 → 1355.68] I'm not an engineer
[1355.68 → 1357.84] what do you think
[1357.84 → 1358.70] will be the next thing
[1358.70 → 1359.58] to go on the wall
[1359.58 → 1360.44] no idea
[1360.44 → 1361.64] what do you think
[1361.64 → 1362.48] of YouTube's
[1362.48 → 1363.28] April Fool's flop
[1363.28 → 1364.00] I actually tweeted
[1364.00 → 1365.00] about this on the first
[1365.00 → 1365.50] I thought it was
[1365.50 → 1366.56] absolutely ridiculous
[1366.56 → 1367.50] it was unfunny
[1367.50 → 1368.08] at the start
[1368.08 → 1369.58] and then it was just
[1369.58 → 1371.60] it got funnier
[1371.60 → 1372.50] and funnier
[1372.50 → 1373.20] throughout the day
[1373.20 → 1374.00] I actually don't even
[1374.00 → 1374.70] know how it ended
[1374.70 → 1375.88] because I just
[1375.88 → 1377.34] completely tuned out
[1377.34 → 1378.06] did you hear about it?
[1378.06 → 1378.70] the event of shutting it down
[1378.70 → 1379.02] or whatever?
[1379.22 → 1379.50] yeah
[1379.50 → 1380.44] and they actually
[1380.44 → 1382.22] streamed for hours
[1382.22 → 1384.06] announcing all the
[1384.06 → 1385.26] entries for the best
[1385.26 → 1386.08] video ever
[1386.08 → 1388.36] like they took it
[1388.36 → 1389.34] so far
[1389.34 → 1389.88] and I think
[1389.88 → 1391.14] I think what YouTube
[1391.14 → 1392.30] forgot is that
[1392.30 → 1392.88] April Fool's
[1392.88 → 1393.62] ends at noon
[1393.62 → 1395.30] all the jokes
[1395.30 → 1395.82] yes
[1395.82 → 1396.74] April Fool's Day
[1396.74 → 1397.46] is only the morning
[1397.46 → 1398.84] of April 1st
[1398.84 → 1399.28] that should be
[1399.28 → 1399.98] April Fool's morning
[1399.98 → 1401.10] well whatever
[1401.10 → 1403.22] that's like saying
[1403.22 → 1403.74] hockey night
[1403.74 → 1404.74] oh they do call it
[1404.74 → 1405.46] hockey night
[1405.46 → 1407.12] it should be
[1407.12 → 1407.68] April Fool's morning
[1407.68 → 1408.00] although
[1408.00 → 1409.22] hockey night in Canada
[1409.22 → 1410.28] often has shows
[1410.28 → 1411.02] like all day
[1411.02 → 1411.62] like during
[1411.62 → 1412.84] HIC day
[1412.84 → 1414.12] and like pre-show
[1414.12 → 1414.92] and all that kind of stuff
[1414.92 → 1416.26] yeah YouTube's thing
[1416.26 → 1417.70] was absolutely ridiculous
[1417.70 → 1419.28] Gmail Blue
[1419.28 → 1420.02] was awesome
[1420.02 → 1421.64] Gmail Blue
[1421.64 → 1421.86] what?
[1422.26 → 1422.70] did you hear about
[1422.70 → 1423.10] Gmail Blue?
[1423.24 → 1423.50] no
[1423.50 → 1424.62] they released this video
[1424.62 → 1425.24] and they were like
[1425.24 → 1426.54] we had to figure out
[1426.54 → 1427.20] how to change
[1427.20 → 1428.18] everything
[1428.18 → 1429.44] while changing
[1429.44 → 1430.56] nothing
[1430.56 → 1431.78] and like just
[1431.78 → 1432.22] it was like
[1432.22 → 1433.10] super epic
[1433.10 → 1434.12] they're slamming
[1434.12 → 1435.14] Windows Blue?
[1436.26 → 1437.16] I don't think so
[1437.16 → 1437.52] actually
[1437.52 → 1438.14] oh okay
[1438.14 → 1439.18] because then
[1439.18 → 1439.96] what they went on to
[1439.96 → 1440.40] was like
[1440.40 → 1441.44] now everything's
[1441.44 → 1441.86] blue
[1441.86 → 1442.96] the italics button
[1442.96 → 1443.70] blue
[1443.70 → 1444.90] the compose button
[1444.90 → 1445.48] oh boy
[1445.48 → 1446.12] blue
[1446.12 → 1447.30] the bold button
[1447.30 → 1448.08] blue
[1448.08 → 1448.84] your font
[1448.84 → 1450.08] blue
[1450.08 → 1450.90] it's like
[1450.90 → 1451.58] really?
[1451.84 → 1452.72] and you could enable
[1452.72 → 1453.12] Gmail Blue
[1453.12 → 1453.38] blue
[1453.38 → 1453.86] and it just made
[1453.86 → 1454.40] everything blue
[1454.40 → 1454.84] you know
[1454.84 → 1456.12] people who
[1456.12 → 1458.08] write in fonts
[1458.08 → 1459.18] I'm about to offend
[1459.18 → 1460.04] a lot of our viewers
[1460.04 → 1460.46] I'm sure
[1460.46 → 1461.16] but people who write
[1461.16 → 1461.98] emails and anything
[1461.98 → 1462.70] other than black
[1462.70 → 1463.16] you know what
[1463.16 → 1464.18] stop it
[1464.18 → 1465.98] why?
[1467.50 → 1468.00] you?
[1468.24 → 1469.30] your MSN font
[1469.30 → 1469.96] was pink
[1469.96 → 1470.70] and like
[1470.70 → 1471.40] Comic Sans
[1471.40 → 1472.32] that's an instant
[1472.32 → 1473.02] messenger
[1473.02 → 1474.00] oh whatever
[1474.00 → 1474.74] what do you mean
[1474.74 → 1475.36] whatever
[1475.36 → 1476.80] it's not an email
[1476.80 → 1477.36] it was pink and Comic Sans
[1477.36 → 1477.96] you know what
[1477.96 → 1479.72] it's kind of
[1479.72 → 1480.70] it's one of those things
[1480.70 → 1481.04] where it's like
[1481.04 → 1482.04] email is a replacement
[1482.04 → 1482.90] for mail
[1482.90 → 1484.08] mail is right in there
[1484.08 → 1485.16] would you send someone
[1485.16 → 1486.12] a letter in crayon?
[1488.44 → 1488.76] right?
[1488.76 → 1489.10] you're like
[1489.10 → 1490.52] passing notes in class
[1490.52 → 1491.62] passing notes in class
[1491.62 → 1492.44] but instead of writing
[1492.44 → 1492.96] with a pen
[1492.96 → 1493.68] like a normal person
[1493.68 → 1494.66] like crayon
[1494.66 → 1496.40] and it's in Comic Sans
[1496.40 → 1497.30] so I can make that voice
[1497.30 → 1497.82] because you're like
[1497.82 → 1499.16] you know what
[1499.16 → 1500.52] Comic Sans is very popular
[1500.52 → 1500.94] you're like
[1500.94 → 1501.64] read my note
[1501.64 → 1502.60] it took a page
[1502.60 → 1504.70] I wrote three words
[1504.70 → 1505.28] you know what
[1505.28 → 1506.42] Comic Sans doesn't take up
[1506.42 → 1507.14] that much space
[1507.14 → 1508.74] next time I chat with you
[1508.74 → 1509.50] I'm using Wingdings
[1509.50 → 1510.24] so there you go
[1510.24 → 1511.18] it's like
[1511.18 → 1512.02] who didn't
[1512.02 → 1513.28] at some point
[1513.28 → 1514.92] switch someone else's computer
[1514.92 → 1515.98] in typing class
[1515.98 → 1516.72] to Wingdings
[1516.72 → 1517.78] only to have them try
[1517.78 → 1518.88] like if you were like
[1518.88 → 1520.64] insert and Wingdings
[1520.64 → 1521.50] I guarantee you
[1521.50 → 1522.62] you could mess people up
[1522.62 → 1523.40] like pretty good
[1523.40 → 1525.36] so we're going to go ahead
[1525.36 → 1526.40] and answer
[1526.40 → 1528.36] our special guest's
[1528.36 → 1529.22] video call
[1529.22 → 1531.40] do do
[1531.40 → 1531.90] do
[1531.90 → 1533.26] oh
[1533.26 → 1533.72] oh yeah
[1533.72 → 1534.12] plug it in
[1534.12 → 1534.56] plug it in
[1534.56 → 1535.52] uh oh
[1535.52 → 1536.74] I think we missed the call
[1536.74 → 1537.54] how did
[1537.54 → 1538.24] didn't you plug it
[1538.24 → 1538.98] click plug it in
[1538.98 → 1539.60] plug it in
[1539.60 → 1541.18] it's gonna mess up
[1541.18 → 1541.88] until you click it though
[1541.88 → 1543.32] okay
[1543.32 → 1544.90] give us a moment here guys
[1544.90 → 1546.00] we're going to get brutal echoing
[1546.00 → 1546.44] for a while
[1546.44 → 1546.90] okay
[1546.90 → 1548.24] call
[1548.24 → 1551.12] there we go
[1551.12 → 1554.20] and make sure that we have
[1554.20 → 1554.88] the correct
[1554.88 → 1556.84] audio device
[1556.84 → 1557.68] oh, oh
[1557.68 → 1558.96] he apparently didn't pick up
[1558.96 → 1561.24] answer
[1561.24 → 1561.96] answer
[1561.96 → 1567.20] oh
[1567.20 → 1569.22] we have problem
[1569.22 → 1571.22] okay
[1571.22 → 1576.46] our skype doesn't want to pick up our mic here
[1576.46 → 1578.02] oh
[1578.02 → 1578.04] oh
[1578.04 → 1578.98] oh
[1578.98 → 1580.10] oh
[1580.10 → 1582.42] uh
[1582.42 → 1584.00] oh you know what I bet it is
[1584.00 → 1584.80] I know what it is
[1584.80 → 1586.72] recording devices
[1586.72 → 1588.64] blue snowball disabled
[1588.64 → 1590.18] enable
[1590.18 → 1591.60] yeah
[1591.60 → 1592.74] now call quick
[1592.74 → 1594.14] because it's going to be terrible echo
[1594.14 → 1594.74] options
[1594.74 → 1595.34] hold on
[1595.34 → 1596.20] I'm going to do this first
[1596.20 → 1597.10] I'm sure it auto picked up
[1597.10 → 1597.52] yeah just
[1597.52 → 1597.74] okay
[1597.74 → 1598.94] call
[1598.94 → 1600.54] all right
[1600.54 → 1601.86] we're going to have it this time guys
[1601.86 → 1603.68] all right
[1603.68 → 1605.12] um
[1605.12 → 1607.00] get out in our headphones
[1607.00 → 1608.06] Brian
[1608.06 → 1608.66] can you
[1608.66 → 1609.56] can you hear us
[1609.56 → 1610.24] are you there
[1610.24 → 1612.26] yes
[1612.26 → 1613.76] you can hear us
[1613.76 → 1614.30] all right
[1614.30 → 1616.02] I guess the real question is
[1616.02 → 1618.44] can we hear you on the live stream
[1618.44 → 1620.74] because we weren't quite sure how well this was gonna work
[1620.74 → 1625.30] I did do some research and I found out what our video problem was
[1625.30 → 1630.90] and it has to do with the very latest version of Skype which I'm guessing you have installed
[1630.90 → 1642.02] are you on the clip chat are we are they able to hear Ryan
[1642.02 → 1642.96] yeah
[1642.96 → 1645.30] okay
[1645.30 → 1656.28] hold on a second
[1656.28 → 1661.28] There we go.
[1661.28 → 1663.78] How about now?
[1663.78 → 1665.16] Ryan, say something.
[1665.16 → 1667.00] OK, let's see if they can hear us.
[1667.00 → 1667.90] They can hear me.
[1667.90 → 1671.36] There we go.
[1671.36 → 1673.40] Anything?
[1673.40 → 1677.44] Oh, boy.
[1677.44 → 1679.84] Is this our first attempt at a Skype colon?
[1679.84 → 1683.80] This actually is our first attempt at a Skype colon.
[1683.80 → 1685.08] It can get complicated.
[1685.08 → 1686.58] We're apparently very quiet.
[1686.58 → 1691.58] So, um, huh.
[1691.58 → 1694.58] Can you send me a message?
[1694.58 → 1697.16] All right.
[1697.16 → 1700.46] And apparently about, OK, guys, stop adding me to Skype right
[1700.46 → 1701.86] now because it's not helping.
[1701.86 → 1704.54] A bunch of people picked up my Skype username and are adding
[1704.54 → 1706.96] me to Skype, so that's actually not very helpful.
[1706.96 → 1711.04] .
[1711.04 → 1714.98] If we turn up our master volume, that may actually
[1714.98 → 1716.48] help.
[1716.48 → 1717.48] .
[1717.48 → 1718.48] Wow.
[1718.48 → 1722.48] That's giving me multiple things here.
[1722.48 → 1723.48] That's great.
[1723.48 → 1724.48] What are you using to stream?
[1724.48 → 1725.48] Are you using XSplit or something?
[1725.48 → 1727.06] Yeah, we are using XSplit.
[1727.06 → 1730.06] Ryan's audible, but we're not.
[1730.06 → 1731.06] .
[1731.06 → 1732.40] All right.
[1732.40 → 1733.90] Ryan, someone says good.
[1733.90 → 1734.90] .
[1734.90 → 1735.90] We're good?
[1735.90 → 1737.90] Yeah, we're getting the go-ahead.
[1737.90 → 1738.90] .
[1738.90 → 1739.90] All right.
[1739.90 → 1740.90] Hey, OK.
[1740.90 → 1741.90] Ryan, welcome to the live stream.
[1741.90 → 1746.90] Tell our audience a little bit about yourself, who you are, what you do, and why the heck you're
[1746.90 → 1747.90] here.
[1747.90 → 1748.90] Who invited you anyway?
[1748.90 → 1750.40] I was one of you guys, I guess.
[1750.40 → 1761.40] So I've been doing PC hardware reviews since late 1999 and several websites throughout the
[1761.40 → 1762.40] build-up to that.
[1762.40 → 1767.40] I did AMDMB.com, which is actually a website, as you might have guessed, that focuses on AMD
[1767.40 → 1769.40] hardware, AMD motherboards, and that kind of thing.
[1769.40 → 1770.40] .
[1770.40 → 1771.40] .
[1771.40 → 1773.40] I didn't figure that out.
[1773.40 → 1775.40] Yeah, no, yeah, AMD MB motherboards.
[1775.40 → 1776.90] It made sense at the time.
[1776.90 → 1780.40] When I graduated from college, though, I decided I was like, I want to make this my full-time
[1780.40 → 1783.40] gig, and I didn't want to be bottlenecked into AMD stuff.
[1783.40 → 1788.40] So we changed the name over to PC Perspective and started going in that direction where we
[1788.40 → 1793.40] started covering all aspects of it, graphics cards, Intel parts, notebooks, all that kind
[1793.40 → 1794.40] of stuff.
[1794.40 → 1797.40] And it has been successful.
[1797.40 → 1801.40] But I haven't had to get another job yet, so that's a good sign.
[1801.40 → 1802.40] Awesome.
[1802.40 → 1807.90] So I think that what everyone is most eager to hear about is actually your recent series
[1807.90 → 1810.90] of articles, which are about what is called frame rating.
[1810.90 → 1816.90] So I'm going to give you a challenge, because your articles were about one light year in total
[1816.90 → 1818.90] length in compact text.
[1818.90 → 1825.90] So I want you to, in like two minutes, explain to our viewers tonight what frame rating is
[1825.90 → 1830.90] versus the more traditional frame rate when we're measuring graphics card performance.
[1830.90 → 1831.90] Okay.
[1831.90 → 1837.90] So most previous testing was done using an application called Fraps, which measures frame rates and
[1837.90 → 1844.90] frame times very, very close to where the game engine decides when to render frames.
[1844.90 → 1849.90] It records it locally on the machine, and it gets data very close to the game engine.
[1849.90 → 1854.90] Frame rating uses a completely different system that actually captures the output from the
[1854.90 → 1857.90] graphics card as if it was a monitor.
[1857.90 → 1862.90] So we're capturing, you know, the 60 hertz signal coming out of the DVI connection of your
[1862.90 → 1863.90] graphics card.
[1863.90 → 1867.90] There's an overlay that we apply to the game at the same location as Fraps, but that's the
[1867.90 → 1870.90] only thing that happens on the actual testing system.
[1870.90 → 1873.90] And then what we do is we capture that data.
[1873.90 → 1879.90] It's a huge amount of data, like 500 megabytes per second worth of writing, of writes.
[1879.90 → 1889.90] And it requires a very fast storage system to do this as well as a pretty expensive capture card that can do up to 2560 by 1440 at 60 hertz.
[1889.90 → 1896.90] So we capture all this data, and then we do post-processing analyzation on those coloured overlay bars that we have placed on the video.
[1896.90 → 1902.90] And when we do that, we can measure frame rates, frame times in a completely different fashion.
[1902.90 → 1911.90] If you go to our very first frame rating story, well, the first full release of data, it's called frame rating dissected at PCPer.com.
[1911.90 → 1917.90] You'll see, you know, we give you screenshots of what we're doing and what we're attempting to do.
[1917.90 → 1922.90] And there's one specific diagram that will show you this is where Fraps measures and this is where frame rating measures.
[1922.90 → 1928.90] And you'll see that frame rating is basically measuring what the gamer sees on their screen.
[1928.90 → 1939.90] So it takes into account any driver hiccups, any driver advantages, any changes that happen throughout the DX pipeline that Fraps would otherwise completely miss.
[1939.90 → 1944.90] Frame rating is able to measure the output as the user sees it.
[1944.90 → 1954.90] And what's important about that is when we look at Fraps data versus frame rating data, there are differences and there are significant differences in some cases on what those performance results look like.
[1954.90 → 1967.90] Hey, Ryan, I'd like to grab your screenshot of the heaven benchmark where you've got blue, green and red frames in the in the field of view at the same time.
[1967.90 → 1981.90] And I'd like you to explain why frame rating is more of a measure of what the gamer will actually see, whereas a frame rate in the traditional sense is a measure of what the game rate or what the gamer is supposed to be seeing.
[1981.90 → 1984.90] So I'm going to throw that up right now.
[1984.90 → 1998.90] So the if you're showing the screenshot of heaven with the coloured overlays, you know, so what we are actually still measuring frame rates and frame times, but we are measuring them at the same point that the user actually sees it.
[1998.90 → 2007.90] Right. So what Fraps tends to measure is very close to what the game engine thinks it's outputting, but it may not actually be what is outputting to the screen.
[2007.90 → 2012.90] There's a huge amount of steps that still occur from the time the game engine lets go of the data.
[2012.90 → 2018.90] It goes into the graphics. It goes into the driver. It goes to the direct X pipeline. Furthermore, it goes through the operating system.
[2018.90 → 2022.90] There's a bunch of steps that has to go through before it's actually outputted to the screen.
[2022.90 → 2029.90] So what you're seeing in that screenshot is a version of the overlay that actually displayed it across the whole frame.
[2029.90 → 2038.90] We now just use a left-hand column that applies it. So you can see that the blue colour there is one frame coming from the game engine.
[2038.90 → 2042.90] The green is another frame from the game engine and the red is another frame.
[2042.90 → 2049.90] Now on your monitor, what you're used to seeing is sometimes you'll see that V-Sync tearing, kind of the horizontal tearing in games.
[2049.90 → 2055.90] And that is because of the different frames being applied at the same refresh cycle of your monitor.
[2055.90 → 2063.90] And so basically all we are doing is applying these coloured overlays to those frames so that in post-processing with this captured video,
[2063.90 → 2071.90] we can analyze those colours because we have predetermined what colour sequence it should come in.
[2071.90 → 2076.90] So we know if there's a missing colour in the sequence that would result in a drop frame.
[2076.90 → 2082.90] And then we can measure the height of that blue or the height of that green or the height of that red colour bar.
[2082.90 → 2088.90] And we can say, okay, this was on the screen for, let's say, 100 scan lines, 100 pixels tall.
[2088.90 → 2094.90] So we know exactly what amount of time that frame was actually displayed on the screen.
[2094.90 → 2102.90] And that helps us get a frame rate and a frame time that we can then bring into all kinds of other data analysis scenarios, I guess.
[2102.90 → 2111.90] So basically what this is doing then is it is actually quantifying that difference in smoothness that gamers would sometimes perceive,
[2111.90 → 2116.90] where if they went from one solution to another, they might go, oh, well, my benchmarks look great.
[2116.90 → 2123.90] But the actual choppiness of the gameplay experience, which can be caused by tearing, as you mentioned before,
[2123.90 → 2126.90] where the frame rate is higher than the refresh rate of the monitor.
[2126.90 → 2132.90] So inherently you're going to be displaying sort of half a frame on the top and half a frame on the bottom.
[2132.90 → 2136.90] And there's going to be that kind of disjointed chunk in between them.
[2136.90 → 2143.90] But in this case, it's happening regardless of what performance you have and what your refresh rate happens to be.
[2143.90 → 2147.90] Yeah, no, that's accurate.
[2147.90 → 2154.90] And what the frame rating system, this whole capture method of graphics performance is supposed to do,
[2154.90 → 2164.90] is it's supposed to let us get us closer to being able to put a quantifiable numeric value on the real-world performance that you see.
[2164.90 → 2174.90] The fraps-based testing, which I keep using that term, but it's a very popular piece of software that gamers use to capture their gameplay video,
[2174.90 → 2180.90] but bench markers and reviewers have used for years and years to measure performance of graphics cards.
[2180.90 → 2182.90] And it would tell you a different story.
[2182.90 → 2184.90] It would say that everything looks fine.
[2184.90 → 2185.90] Your average frame rate is great.
[2185.90 → 2188.90] You know, your average frame rate per second looks pretty good.
[2188.90 → 2194.90] But when you play the game or if you watch video of the gameplay, you see something doesn't seem right.
[2194.90 → 2197.90] It seems like the animation isn't as smooth as it should be.
[2197.90 → 2205.90] And by capturing the data with these overlays and doing analysis after the fact, we can look at it in a completely different light.
[2205.90 → 2216.90] And what's happened is the biggest offender, the biggest problem that we've found is with some AMD Crossfire combinations where you get these things called runs.
[2216.90 → 2220.90] It's hard to maybe explain without a diagram or visual cue.
[2220.90 → 2221.90] But if you look...
[2221.90 → 2224.90] Can we get into runs in maybe about three more minutes?
[2224.90 → 2225.90] Yeah.
[2225.90 → 2230.90] Because I want to make sure that everyone fully understands that graphic that we showed before.
[2230.90 → 2232.90] So guys, when...
[2232.90 → 2234.90] Ryan, can you explain?
[2234.90 → 2240.90] When Fraps was telling you, let's say, 60 frames per second,
[2240.90 → 2250.90] what it meant was that the game engine called for 60 frames to be drawn, but that may not actually be what's displayed.
[2250.90 → 2256.90] So let's go back to that blue, green and red image and tell me how many...
[2256.90 → 2264.90] What kind of difference could there actually be between what Fraps is reporting and what the gamers actually seeing
[2264.90 → 2270.90] where some of those frames might have been a tiny little slice that they barely even got any benefit from?
[2270.90 → 2272.90] That's the difference, right?
[2272.90 → 2274.90] So when you...
[2274.90 → 2279.90] Say you run a benchmark for 60 seconds, you can get one number out of it.
[2279.90 → 2281.90] You know, 10 years ago, that's how we ran benchmarks.
[2281.90 → 2287.90] Over 60 seconds, you would say my average frame rate in Quake 3 was 112 frames per second.
[2287.90 → 2288.90] Okay?
[2288.90 → 2291.90] And then years after that, we stretched out a little bit further.
[2291.90 → 2295.90] We said, okay, well now show me that average frame rate every second of that 60 seconds.
[2295.90 → 2297.90] And you would get different kinds...
[2297.90 → 2299.90] You would get a bar graph of frame rate over time.
[2299.90 → 2303.90] And now what we're looking at is what is the instantaneous frame rate
[2303.90 → 2308.90] inside that time period, that single second of time.
[2308.90 → 2312.90] And that is where the real difference between what Fraps sees
[2312.90 → 2315.90] and what the frame rating capture system sees.
[2315.90 → 2320.90] Because even though you might get 60 frames a second,
[2320.90 → 2324.90] if half of those frames are what we call runt frames,
[2324.90 → 2326.90] where they're very thin slivers of colour.
[2326.90 → 2330.90] So if we look at that heaven screenshot there,
[2330.90 → 2335.90] imagine if the green was a fifth of that size or a quarter of that size.
[2335.90 → 2337.90] We might consider that a runt frame.
[2337.90 → 2341.90] And a runt frame is a frame that is displayed on the screen.
[2341.90 → 2343.90] It's not dropping the frame completely.
[2343.90 → 2345.90] But it takes up so little real estate on your monitor
[2345.90 → 2351.90] that its effect on the animation and smoothness of the gameplay is negligible.
[2351.90 → 2357.90] So what we decided to do, and this is all kind of our decision and based on analysis of gameplay,
[2357.90 → 2359.90] is let's take that frame out of the picture.
[2359.90 → 2363.90] We don't think that that frame is worth noting,
[2363.90 → 2368.90] worth counting in our new observed frame rate system.
[2368.90 → 2372.90] And when we take those out, you get a much different average frame rate.
[2372.90 → 2375.90] So instead of getting 60 frames per second,
[2375.90 → 2380.90] what you're actually perceiving may be 40 or 35 frames per second.
[2380.90 → 2385.90] And that is kind of the new performance metric we are trying to kind of push out there
[2385.90 → 2388.90] and get feedback on and get gamers to really take notice of.
[2388.90 → 2394.90] Because some games and some graphics cards will space out the frames evenly.
[2394.90 → 2396.90] It'll be a nice smooth animation.
[2396.90 → 2397.90] You won't have any stutter.
[2397.90 → 2402.90] In some games, you know, you're running every other frame is a runt frame.
[2402.90 → 2406.90] So you're actually kind of seeing perceived half frame rate
[2406.90 → 2408.90] than what Fraps may have been telling you before.
[2408.90 → 2415.90] And have you seen anything that extreme where the difference might actually be like a one over two
[2415.90 → 2420.90] where you're actually only getting a benefit from half of the frames that your video card worked on?
[2420.90 → 2429.90] Yeah, it's actually the AM Crossfire configurations in single monitor situations.
[2429.90 → 2432.90] 1920 by 1080 we've tested and 2560 by 1440.
[2432.90 → 2437.90] Most of the time in a GPU bottleneck situation.
[2437.90 → 2443.90] So take Battlefield 3, Crisis 3, Sleeping Dogs, Far Cry 3, those types of games.
[2444.90 → 2451.90] Many times Crossfire is showing every other frame as a runt frame.
[2451.90 → 2458.90] And the difference between what AMD is doing with Crossfire and what NVIDIA is doing with SLI, and it's a very important distinction,
[2458.90 → 2463.90] is that NVIDIA has been including what they call hardware frame metering technology.
[2463.90 → 2469.90] It started in the G80 architecture, and it's in the Kepler architecture today as well, of course.
[2469.90 → 2477.90] And they have an algorithm that attempts to space out the frames in an even pattern based on what the game engine is telling it.
[2477.90 → 2482.90] Whereas AMD on the other hand is simply spitting out frames as quickly as they can render them.
[2482.90 → 2492.90] And the result is sometimes you'll see a 50%, essentially 50% drop in perceived or observed frame rate when using Crossfire.
[2492.90 → 2498.90] If you look through the frame rating dissected article, and you take a look at some of the
[2498.90 → 2506.90] if you look at Battlefield 3 results, it compares a 7970 and a GTX 680 in single and multi-GPU configurations.
[2506.90 → 2509.90] In single GPU, both cards look great.
[2509.90 → 2515.90] They're evenly distributed frame rates and in frame times, and it's a smooth animation and the frame,
[2515.90 → 2519.90] the FRAPS frame rate is the same as the observed frame rate.
[2519.90 → 2529.90] When we look at multi-GPU, Crossfire versus SLI, you'll see in Battlefield 3 that Crossfire has almost every other frame as a run.
[2529.90 → 2532.90] SLI has no runs.
[2532.90 → 2539.90] Other games like Skyrim that are mostly CPU limited on these high-end graphics cards don't exhibit this problem with Crossfire.
[2539.90 → 2545.90] So it's game dependent, which is making it difficult to kind of, you know, nail down 100%.
[2545.90 → 2555.90] Now is this something that gamers have been potentially interpreting as that stigma of multi-GPU configurations called micro-stuttering?
[2555.90 → 2558.90] Yes. And I believe that's...
[2558.90 → 2566.90] I also believe we've always seen report that I added an extra graphics card to my system and nothing feels faster.
[2566.90 → 2573.90] Right? And perhaps maybe reporting that it's faster, the in-game benchmark, like if you run DIRT 3, and it has an in-game benchmark,
[2573.90 → 2579.90] or Tomb Raider, and it has an in-game benchmark, it's going to show that it's running 80% faster, but it doesn't feel faster.
[2579.90 → 2586.90] And what it may actually be doing is it may be throwing so much more graphics horsepower at the system that you are now CPU bound,
[2586.90 → 2588.90] which may help smooth it out anyway.
[2588.90 → 2589.90] Correct. Yeah.
[2589.90 → 2592.90] Even...so it's like one bug fixing another bug.
[2592.90 → 2597.90] Yeah, exactly. That's right. And it's something that's never been...
[2597.90 → 2607.90] Nobody's been able to really capture what it is that people are seeing and what they're experiencing until we started doing this.
[2607.90 → 2613.90] Okay, we're going to actually...you know, the first idea was to use high-speed cameras to capture the screen footage
[2613.90 → 2616.90] and then measure the coloured overlays in the same way.
[2616.90 → 2621.90] But we were able to actually get a capture card that could capture at a high enough resolution and refresh rate
[2621.90 → 2625.90] that we could keep that, you know, a more scientific kind of fixed result.
[2625.90 → 2632.90] If you go to that Dissected article, we actually posted a video comparing side-by-side Crossfire versus SLI,
[2632.90 → 2637.90] I think on five or six different games, that we had recorded a bunch of videos.
[2637.90 → 2642.90] Because, I mean, for this process, we're recording 500 legs a second.
[2642.90 → 2646.90] We have a one-terabyte Thunderbolt RAID 0 array of SSDs.
[2646.90 → 2652.90] And I bet when we're testing all day, we fill it up three times before we have to dump it off someplace else.
[2652.90 → 2653.90] Awesome.
[2653.90 → 2656.90] There are tons of data being generated with this.
[2656.90 → 2659.90] So tell me something.
[2659.90 → 2663.90] What do you see as the future of video card benchmarking?
[2663.90 → 2667.90] So say, for example, someone like me who might not have two grand to drop on the capture card
[2667.90 → 2671.90] and certainly doesn't have access to the custom software tools that you're using.
[2671.90 → 2676.90] If you want this to be a standard, how are you going to achieve that?
[2676.90 → 2679.90] That will be difficult.
[2679.90 → 2688.90] I think over time the capability of this capture card that we have will become a lot cheaper.
[2688.90 → 2694.90] But I think there's always going to be two mindsets in terms of performance metric.
[2694.90 → 2697.90] There's still going to be people that do the fraps testing.
[2697.90 → 2701.90] There's still going to be people that use the in-game benchmarks that help everyday consumers
[2701.90 → 2707.90] that just want to see how their cards and their games compared to other people's cards and games.
[2707.90 → 2710.90] But that number may not be right at all.
[2710.90 → 2712.90] It might just be random.
[2712.90 → 2714.90] And that depends.
[2714.90 → 2718.90] And that's where people who kind of do this professionally,
[2718.90 → 2723.90] where I was willing to invest the money and the time and the resources in this to kind of say,
[2723.90 → 2727.90] okay, you know what, in this game the benchmarks match perfectly.
[2727.90 → 2730.90] So feel free to use those metrics.
[2730.90 → 2732.90] In this game it doesn't match up at all.
[2732.90 → 2735.90] And it's something that AMD is hoping to fix, right?
[2735.90 → 2736.90] They know about this problem now.
[2736.90 → 2738.90] They've known about it for a month or so.
[2738.90 → 2745.90] And in my communications with them, they think they will be able to fix it probably in the summer of this year.
[2745.90 → 2752.90] So we may, you know, move away from this particular problem and then go on to find other problems.
[2752.90 → 2757.90] Because I think the future of graphics testing is more about stuff like this.
[2757.90 → 2762.90] What the gamer sees versus what a software tool can tell you.
[2762.90 → 2764.90] And it's getting more complicated.
[2764.90 → 2773.90] And that's because when we get into an era where almost all computing devices, processors or graphics cards are, quote, good enough, right?
[2773.90 → 2776.90] If you're running a 1080p screen, do you need a GTX 680?
[2776.90 → 2777.90] Do you need a GTX 690?
[2777.90 → 2778.90] Maybe not.
[2778.90 → 2783.90] But maybe so once we start to get into these other kind of performance metrics, right?
[2783.90 → 2789.90] So the average frame rate looked great comparing a $200 card and a $350 card.
[2789.90 → 2795.90] But maybe the smoothness of the $200 card and the $350 card are very different.
[2795.90 → 2797.90] Right. I see. Okay.
[2797.90 → 2800.90] So...
[2800.90 → 2802.90] The biggest thing for me is the runs.
[2802.90 → 2807.90] Because it actually, like, not only does it give you a higher number when it's not really looking better,
[2807.90 → 2809.90] but it legitimately makes it look worse.
[2810.90 → 2818.90] You know what I would like to do is I'd like to go to Twitter, and I'd like to pick out a couple top questions for Ryan and have him address those.
[2818.90 → 2819.90] Sure.
[2819.90 → 2822.90] Um, I'm just looking right now.
[2822.90 → 2823.90] Okay.
[2824.90 → 2825.90] Wow.
[2825.90 → 2828.90] It looks like nobody has sent in any questions.
[2828.90 → 2829.90] Okay, guys.
[2829.90 → 2831.90] Send in some questions for Ryan.
[2831.90 → 2835.90] Because as far as experts on this whole frame rating thing goes,
[2835.90 → 2840.90] he's pretty much one of the top sort of two or three, maybe half a dozen guys.
[2840.90 → 2843.90] I don't know how many guys are really prominent in all of this.
[2843.90 → 2846.90] But he's one of the top guys, and he knows a lot about it.
[2846.90 → 2849.90] He's one of the few guys who has the actual hardware to test it.
[2849.90 → 2853.90] So, guys, we've got him on for another at least eight minutes here.
[2853.90 → 2855.90] So, hit me.
[2855.90 → 2868.90] While we wait for a question to come in, I know we just finished putting out today all of our results from basically the entire lineup of the 7000 series Radeon cards and the X600 series cards from NVIDIA.
[2868.90 → 2872.90] And now we're going to move on to some feedback we've gotten, right?
[2872.90 → 2880.90] So, there are some third party applications that can enable frame rate limiting on Radeon Crossfire configurations.
[2880.90 → 2882.90] And what kind of effect does that have?
[2882.90 → 2888.90] How dramatic of an effect does enabling or disabling different versions of vertical sync and V-Sync affect things?
[2888.90 → 2893.90] A lot of people are saying settings within the AMD driver can help improve things.
[2893.90 → 2894.90] Okay.
[2894.90 → 2901.90] So, the first question from MissionCode45 is, is this just going to be a driver fix and then the whole thing goes away?
[2903.90 → 2909.90] I think that it will be a driver fix, but I still think there will be differences.
[2909.90 → 2914.90] Because NVIDIA used to do their frame metering in software in a driver.
[2914.90 → 2931.90] As of the Kepler architecture, they moved it onto hardware, which enables it to be faster, it can be more efficient, and it can change dynamically as the game changes, as the game engine rate changes, much more quickly than if it has to go through the operating system hooks.
[2931.90 → 2946.90] And I also think that if it's done in software, there's more likelihood that we will have to keep a vigilant eye on AMD's team for not hacking away.
[2946.90 → 2953.90] You know, they could easily change a driver and make our graphs look better, but not improve the gameplay experience.
[2953.90 → 2961.90] So, we're already looking at new ways to adjust and check for those types of cheating.
[2961.90 → 2983.90] Like, the biggest thing we're trying to do now is input latency testing, because that is where I think if you hack your way around this runt issue, what they can officially introduce latency into the frames, which will make our graphs look prettier, but will actually introduce more latency into your mouse keyboard movements on the screen, which will adversely affect gameplay more.
[2983.90 → 2984.90] So, that's cool.
[2984.90 → 2993.90] So, for, oh, sorry, for our viewers who don't know what input latency is, it's a combination between the signal delays that all occur.
[2993.90 → 3004.90] So, the delay between when you move your mouse and when your computer receives that signal, between when your computer receives that signal, and it processes it and sends it to your monitor.
[3004.90 → 3012.90] When your monitor receives the signal, changes over the pixels, and then when it waits for the next actual refresh rate to finally display something to your eyes.
[3012.90 → 3017.90] And I missed a bunch of steps, because I'm doing this off the cup, but that's basically what it means.
[3017.90 → 3020.90] And there's a delay in the actual graphics card itself.
[3020.90 → 3028.90] So, what Ryan's saying is that AMD could just kind of go, it could, they could queue up frames, and then they could display them to you later.
[3028.90 → 3039.90] But that could be adding as much as another, I mean, even if they queued up two frames, that would add another 33 milliseconds of latency, which is very detectable to the unseated eye.
[3039.90 → 3048.90] Yeah, yeah, no, it can be. And we're trying to work on another version of an overlay that might be able to help us detect these types of things.
[3048.90 → 3057.90] But it gets, it's even more complicated, because now we have to somehow match what the user is actually inputting on a mouse keyboard versus what's happening on the screen.
[3057.90 → 3063.90] Now, an Aztec's article was more from AMD's perspective, and yours was more from Nvidia's perspective.
[3063.90 → 3071.90] And they seem to be taking the angle, at least in their presentation, that AMD is acknowledging this, and they're committed to fixing it.
[3071.90 → 3089.90] And that's all seems like it's very positive for the gamer. But you seem to be preemptively gearing up for another arms race, the likes of which we haven't seen since probably the 3DMark 2001 era, when there were driver optimizations all over the place, trying to fake performance.
[3089.90 → 3091.90] Do you see that happening?
[3091.90 → 3111.90] I do think that it could happen, right? So if the backlash from these risks and this kind of issues, crossfire and infinity that we're seeing, get to be very bad, you know, a VP at AMD can tell the driver team, I don't care what you got to do, fix this in two weeks.
[3111.90 → 3117.90] And that's when you get into that issue of, you know, hacks and cheats and that kind of stuff.
[3117.90 → 3122.90] Because the people I talk to, the engineers I talk to at AMD, they don't want to do that.
[3122.90 → 3127.90] They see the problems, they want to fix it long term now that they see the results.
[3127.90 → 3133.90] Nobody was testing for this before. Like, AMD just kind of assumed that their way was working just fine.
[3133.90 → 3140.90] And it wasn't until we started to get some of these results and say, hey guys, look at this, this is going to be a big problem.
[3140.90 → 3149.90] You need to start looking at this. And I don't, I don't, I don't think it will turn into that because luck favours the prepared.
[3149.90 → 3150.90] Yeah.
[3150.90 → 3152.90] All right. Gotcha.
[3152.90 → 3154.90] So sorry, go ahead.
[3154.90 → 3160.90] I just going to say, I don't think it'll turn into that because, because we have the capability now to watch for that.
[3160.90 → 3165.90] And we have a whole, I have spent a lot of money on this system. We're going to use it.
[3165.90 → 3167.90] So all right, fair enough.
[3167.90 → 3174.90] Now, given that Nvidia has fixed the problem in hardware and AMD's in software right now and becoming aware of it now.
[3174.90 → 3180.90] How long do you think it'll be before AMD can release a GPU that actually builds this into hardware?
[3180.90 → 3186.90] I mean, I know how long a hardware development cycle is, but I think a lot of our viewers probably don't understand that
[3186.90 → 3191.90] because they see the kind of secrecy and cloak and dagger that goes into a GPU launch.
[3191.90 → 3196.90] And it seems like kind of Nvidia's worried that if AMD founds out about something two weeks earlier,
[3196.90 → 3201.90] they might somehow be able to engineer a new GPU to combat it at launch.
[3201.90 → 3207.90] So how long is it going to be before AMD can address this to the same level that Nvidia has already?
[3207.90 → 3212.90] You know, you've got to wait for the 8000 series to get by and maybe in the 9000.
[3212.90 → 3214.90] So, I mean, you're exactly right.
[3214.90 → 3219.90] So Nvidia's had this technology for a while, and they've never talked about it.
[3219.90 → 3227.90] Even behind closed doors, really, like editors and media, they've never, it's been like a feather in their cap that they never really discussed
[3227.90 → 3235.90] because they were waiting for a time when it was really going to be necessary, or maybe they had nothing else left to throw at the, you know, to throw at their enemy.
[3235.90 → 3238.90] And now they have this idea, okay, let's, let's use this now.
[3238.90 → 3242.90] But as soon as, you know, the cat's out of the bag, AMD is going to try to replicate it.
[3242.90 → 3245.90] And they've got smart guys, they've got smart engineers, they'll be able to do it.
[3245.90 → 3250.90] But for, you know, the Sea Islands architecture, that's already shipping, that's not going to happen.
[3250.90 → 3256.90] The next major iteration of Radeon won't have it either.
[3256.90 → 3264.90] So we may be looking at two years before you see a true hardware implementation of frame metering.
[3264.90 → 3271.90] Now, that doesn't mean it can't make it better in software, but, you know, we run, there is the potential for more issues.
[3271.90 → 3277.90] Just like, you know, we've seen issues with infinity and Crossfire scaling because of the composite engine that they're still using.
[3277.90 → 3281.90] And there are other things that can creep up when you're using this software.
[3281.90 → 3284.90] Okay, I'd like to take a few more Twitter questions now.
[3284.90 → 3286.90] And let's try to get through these quite quickly.
[3286.90 → 3292.90] Mike would know asks which game had the least discrepancy between fraps and your method?
[3292.90 → 3296.90] Probably that would be Skyrim.
[3296.90 → 3298.90] It's the most CPU bound game.
[3298.90 → 3303.90] And so there was very little difference between what fraps saw and what our capture method saw.
[3303.90 → 3311.90] However, that might change and be turned completely on its ear if you were to add a bunch of visually quality enhancing mods to it.
[3311.90 → 3313.90] Yeah, that's true. That's true.
[3313.90 → 3318.90] If you're one of those guys that does all the mods to Skyrim, yes, that could shift.
[3318.90 → 3320.90] So bear that in mind, guys.
[3320.90 → 3321.90] Here we go.
[3321.90 → 3325.90] Do you think when GPUs are powerful... Oh.
[3325.90 → 3328.90] No, hold on. That's not a very good question.
[3328.90 → 3330.90] Sorry.
[3330.90 → 3336.90] Brobrat137 asks, with people aware of this new testing method,
[3336.90 → 3343.90] Fraps benchmarking results will now be subject to a lot of fanboy infighting.
[3343.90 → 3354.90] How do you plan to educate and combat this so that people fully understand why this new method needs to be developed?
[3354.90 → 3359.90] So one of the ways that I'm doing that is by doing things like coming on your show, right?
[3359.90 → 3366.90] We want everybody to understand these differences, even if they're not already readers of PC perspective
[3366.90 → 3370.90] and they're not already really hardcore GPU geeks.
[3370.90 → 3373.90] They're not hanging out at the Beyond 3D forums or something like that.
[3373.90 → 3378.90] We want people to understand that be careful of these benchmarks you're looking at now
[3378.90 → 3381.90] because there are issues that are going to crop up.
[3381.90 → 3384.90] And I think it takes...
[3384.90 → 3385.90] You know, it's going to take...
[3385.90 → 3386.90] We plan on...
[3386.90 → 3389.90] I plan on writing a lot more about this throughout the spring and the summer, right?
[3389.90 → 3393.90] We're going to do a lot more research on it, a lot more publication of numbers.
[3393.90 → 3398.90] We've had lots of requests for specific, you know, try this, try that type options.
[3398.90 → 3403.90] And then, you know, we hope to be able to bring it to, you know, your readers and your viewers
[3403.90 → 3409.90] in any way we can and anybody else's readers or viewers to kind of explain it as we go.
[3409.90 → 3413.90] Because I know it's very complicated, and I know it's very different from what's happened before.
[3413.90 → 3417.90] And I totally understand, you know, the confusion behind it.
[3417.90 → 3421.90] That first article, that frame rating dissected article was 17,000 words.
[3421.90 → 3426.90] And a lot of people want to sit there and read that about that much about GPUs.
[3426.90 → 3427.90] What's sitting?
[3427.90 → 3432.90] Well, I'm going to confess, I made my way through your article and probably about...
[3432.90 → 3437.90] I read it a couple of times so that I could make sure that I fully understand it.
[3437.90 → 3441.90] Because I didn't want to have you on and then just totally not understand anything that you wrote about.
[3441.90 → 3443.90] Because that would be really embarrassing.
[3443.90 → 3449.90] But I'm going to be honest and tell you that even for me, and I've been following this stuff for quite a long time,
[3449.90 → 3453.90] it was difficult to fully wrap my head around it.
[3453.90 → 3458.90] So, I mean, I think it's great that you're coming onto our show and that you're explaining this.
[3458.90 → 3461.90] And I think stuff like this is going to go a long way towards helping people understand.
[3461.90 → 3463.90] So I think it's great.
[3463.90 → 3465.90] I'm going to kick off with another Twitter question here.
[3465.90 → 3467.90] I don't know how much longer you have.
[3467.90 → 3471.90] Guys, I hope you really appreciate Ryan joining us because he's on the East Coast.
[3471.90 → 3475.90] So he's actually three hours ahead of us, meaning it's one in the morning right now.
[3475.90 → 3478.90] And I'm sure he's tired, but this is absolutely fantastic.
[3478.90 → 3480.90] So Bresson Franco asks,
[3480.90 → 3488.90] Is it possible to define a frame rate where the GPU will force itself to stay without going any higher?
[3488.90 → 3491.90] And I think what he might be talking about is sync,
[3491.90 → 3495.90] but maybe without using sync.
[3495.90 → 3500.90] So that's actually a fascinating topic.
[3500.90 → 3505.90] If you look at most game engines today, just kind of go as fast as they can.
[3505.90 → 3506.90] There's no fixed clock.
[3506.90 → 3511.90] And it is the fact that there's no fixed time counter in a game engine
[3511.90 → 3514.90] that is essentially causing these problems in the long run.
[3514.90 → 3519.90] It's why if you look at a console, console games don't typically have this problem
[3519.90 → 3523.90] because developers know exactly what hardware it's going to go on so they can create
[3523.90 → 3526.90] regardless of whether the GPU wanted it to or not.
[3526.90 → 3535.90] And if you ever played Rage and you saw a lot of the issues that came up with texture tearing, texture draw in,
[3535.90 → 3538.90] where people were complained about how if you spun around really quick,
[3538.90 → 3542.90] the image behind you wasn't as sharp as it was or as it should be.
[3542.90 → 3544.90] And it came in over the course of a half a second or so.
[3544.90 → 3549.90] And that was because the game engine sent a new frame every 60th of a second,
[3549.90 → 3552.90] even if the rest of the pipeline wasn't ready.
[3552.90 → 3555.90] And because of that, you didn't have any input latency issues.
[3555.90 → 3558.90] You didn't have any of these potential stutter issues.
[3558.90 → 3560.90] But what you ran into were these quality.
[3560.90 → 3561.90] Hold on, Ryan.
[3561.90 → 3563.90] We might have dropped.
[3563.90 → 3564.90] Just a sec.
[3564.90 → 3565.90] Okay.
[3565.90 → 3568.90] Uh, that's weird.
[3568.90 → 3571.90] I saw, I see an ad on the screen now.
[3571.90 → 3572.90] Yeah, me too.
[3572.90 → 3574.90] Well, here, go here.
[3574.90 → 3575.90] Hold on.
[3575.90 → 3578.90] Ad will end in zero seconds.
[3578.90 → 3580.90] Is it going to bring us back?
[3580.90 → 3581.90] Oh, that's weird.
[3581.90 → 3582.90] Okay, we're back.
[3582.90 → 3585.90] So sorry, can you back up a little bit and...
[3585.90 → 3586.90] Oh, shoot.
[3586.90 → 3587.90] You were talking...
[3587.90 → 3588.90] Right, okay.
[3588.90 → 3593.90] So you were talking about Rage and how John Carmack decided that one frame every 60 seconds
[3593.90 → 3598.90] is what they need and the texture issues that came along with that.
[3598.90 → 3599.90] Please go ahead.
[3599.90 → 3602.90] So, the game Rage kind of flipped it.
[3602.90 → 3606.90] John Carmack, being the kind of guy that he is, just wrote an engine that said,
[3606.90 → 3611.90] I don't care what your graphics card does, I'm going to give you a frame to render every once
[3611.90 → 3614.90] or 60 times a second, I should say.
[3614.90 → 3624.90] And that is why you saw some visual graphical quality issues, because the game engine was spitting out a frame at a fixed pattern.
[3624.90 → 3638.90] It was not going to deviate from that because they wanted the user experience of smooth frame rates, low input latency, to be of the highest priority, as opposed to image quality as the highest priority.
[3638.90 → 3643.90] And so that is an example of a game, it's the only one in recent memory that's really done that.
[3643.90 → 3650.90] And you can see that while it fixed stutter and input latency, it caused graphical issues, right?
[3650.90 → 3653.90] Because that's not how PC games are really developed.
[3653.90 → 3658.90] They're not used to having a fixed render time on the graphics card.
[3658.90 → 3662.90] Some frames take longer to render than others if there's a big explosion or something like that.
[3662.90 → 3667.90] And that feedback was just interpreted differently in the Rage engine.
[3667.90 → 3670.90] So is this something that could work itself out in time?
[3670.90 → 3677.90] If game developers started building in technology like that, maybe a more refined version of that,
[3677.90 → 3686.90] and graphics cards continue to get fast enough that older games that didn't have this technology implemented could all be rendered completely smoothly, easily anyway.
[3686.90 → 3692.90] Ten years from now, if no one makes any changes on the hardware side, could this just go away?
[3692.90 → 3695.90] It could. I also think that it would be...
[3695.90 → 3699.90] All this takes really is a couple of API changes.
[3699.90 → 3705.90] If Recto implements the capability for the graphics engine and the graphics...
[3705.90 → 3712.90] I'm sorry, for the game engine and the graphics card to communicate on what time it is currently,
[3712.90 → 3715.90] when did you actually display that frame?
[3715.90 → 3720.90] I will adjust my in-game timers for where these physical objects should be accordingly.
[3720.90 → 3729.90] If that gets implemented, game engines and GPU drivers can be written in a way that it would possibly just completely eliminate this issue.
[3729.90 → 3732.90] But it's not in DX11. It's not in DX11.1.
[3732.90 → 3736.90] It's not on the current slate for the next version of Recto either.
[3736.90 → 3738.90] I don't really know why.
[3738.90 → 3741.90] I think maybe just because this issue hasn't been getting enough attention,
[3741.90 → 3750.90] and maybe Microsoft and those guys will take this a little bit more seriously and implement something like that going forward.
[3750.90 → 3754.90] But that is what I think the actual answer is.
[3754.90 → 3757.90] Maybe not ten years from now, but maybe three years from now.
[3757.90 → 3763.90] And then we can still have improved hardware performance, and we don't have to worry about having a static hardware environment.
[3763.90 → 3766.90] We can still count on improvements.
[3766.90 → 3771.90] Okay, so I'm going to take two more questions.
[3771.90 → 3774.90] Here we go.
[3774.90 → 3777.90] What are the maximum minimum differences you've seen?
[3777.90 → 3786.90] Here's a question from Tyler Wire.
[3786.90 → 3791.90] He asks, have you had a chance to test any laptop GPUs?
[3791.90 → 3793.90] And would you expect it to be better or worse?
[3793.90 → 3796.90] I haven't actually tested any laptop GPUs yet.
[3796.90 → 3802.90] And it will be more difficult because we either have to connect an external display
[3802.90 → 3806.90] or start to get into the high-speed frame, high-speed camera capture methods.
[3806.90 → 3808.90] I don't expect it would be any different though.
[3808.90 → 3810.90] The architectures are fundamentally the same.
[3810.90 → 3812.90] The drivers are fundamentally the same.
[3812.90 → 3817.90] But the benefit in most cases, except for the really high-end gaming laptops,
[3817.90 → 3818.90] that they're single GPU.
[3818.90 → 3822.90] And in single GPU configurations, we don't really see this problem.
[3822.90 → 3827.90] So it would eliminate a major portion of the problems.
[3827.90 → 3832.90] Okay, I've got two more things for you here.
[3832.90 → 3836.90] One more question and then one comment that I thought was perfect.
[3836.90 → 3843.90] So Guitar iPod asks, could you write a Coles Notes or Cliff Notes version of your article
[3843.90 → 3848.90] where you explain it for a complete non-techie, maybe a one-page primer?
[3848.90 → 3851.90] Do you think that's even possible?
[3851.90 → 3853.90] I think that's possible.
[3853.90 → 3858.90] And it's probably something that we need to do that we can then include at the beginning
[3858.90 → 3861.90] of all of our future frame-rating articles.
[3861.90 → 3865.90] The other thing would be if people are interested, if they don't want to read all that,
[3865.90 → 3870.90] I did attempt to kind of sum it up in a video that we posted on our YouTube channel.
[3870.90 → 3872.90] It was about 20 minutes long.
[3872.90 → 3877.90] Look at this guy pimping his YouTube channel here as a friggin' competitor and trying to –
[3877.90 → 3878.90] no, I'm kidding.
[3878.90 → 3879.90] Just go ahead.
[3879.90 → 3883.90] We did like a 20-minute video that attempts to explain the whole process
[3883.90 → 3889.90] and go over what graphs we present and what data that actually – what it means
[3889.90 → 3892.90] so that it gives you a primer to then go into the rest of our articles,
[3892.90 → 3898.90] look at all the results accordingly, and have an understanding of it.
[3898.90 → 3899.90] But I do like that idea.
[3899.90 → 3904.90] That's a good idea to kind of have – see if we can sum it up in 500 words
[3904.90 → 3908.90] or 1,000 words for a one-pager type presentation.
[3908.90 → 3911.90] So I think this is the last question I'm going to take right now.
[3911.90 → 3913.90] Sorry, it's not really a question.
[3913.90 → 3917.90] So Brobrat137 says he doesn't have any questions because between the article
[3917.90 → 3921.90] and your explanation tonight, he feels completely educated on the subject.
[3921.90 → 3926.90] So I just want to – if you don't have anything else to add, do you have anything else
[3926.90 → 3928.90] you wanted to cover really quick?
[3928.90 → 3933.90] No, I think that's – you know, I feel like I've tried to explain what it is.
[3933.90 → 3939.90] And we go on in the weeks ahead if we want to meet up again and talk.
[3939.90 → 3941.90] I'm more than happy to.
[3941.90 → 3945.90] I can't do every Friday night at midnight.
[3945.90 → 3948.90] It starts to get a little angry.
[3948.90 → 3950.90] I do enjoy coming on and discussing it.
[3950.90 → 3953.90] It's something that I have been working on for like 18 months.
[3953.90 → 3958.90] We were really excited to finally release all of this data that we had been gathering for so long.
[3958.90 → 3962.90] So it's a topic I take a lot of interest in.
[3962.90 → 3963.90] Okay.
[3963.90 → 3965.90] Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight, Ryan.
[3965.90 → 3973.90] Guys, if you are not already aware, it's at Paper on Twitter, and it's YouTube.com slash Paper.
[3973.90 → 3974.90] Is that correct, Ryan?
[3974.90 → 3975.90] Yep, that's the one.
[3975.90 → 3976.90] Okay.
[3976.90 → 3977.90] And then it's also PCPer.com.
[3977.90 → 3978.90] It's really hard to remember.
[3978.90 → 3980.90] P-C-P-E-R.
[3980.90 → 3981.90] Yep, very cool.
[3981.90 → 3987.90] I appreciate you having me on, and hopefully we'll bring you back on our podcast sometime
[3987.90 → 3988.90] soon as well.
[3988.90 → 3989.90] All right, cool.
[3989.90 → 3990.90] Thanks for joining us.
[3990.90 → 3992.90] And to all the viewers, I'm sorry for the technical difficulties.
[3992.90 → 3997.90] Next time we'll spend some more time practicing Skype calls before we get this show on the road.
[3997.90 → 3998.90] We'll have the answer.
[3998.90 → 3999.90] All right, take care.
[3999.90 → 4000.90] Good night, Ryan.
[4003.90 → 4007.90] All right, so we can finally take these headphones off.
[4007.90 → 4011.90] I hope you guys did find that to be educational in spite of the...
[4011.90 → 4012.90] Oh, yeah, there, that's done.
[4012.90 → 4018.90] I hope you guys found that to be educational in spite of some of the glitches that we did endure.
[4018.90 → 4020.90] I don't know what was up with that ad.
[4020.90 → 4021.90] Like, are we...
[4021.90 → 4022.90] Yeah.
[4022.90 → 4024.90] No, the ad wasn't only it though.
[4024.90 → 4027.90] I think the stream went offline, so Twitch rolled the ad.
[4027.90 → 4029.90] Because Twitch will roll ads while the stream is offline.
[4029.90 → 4030.90] I see.
[4030.90 → 4031.90] So Twitch rolled the ad in a reaction.
[4031.90 → 4033.90] Twitch didn't push the ad.
[4033.90 → 4034.90] Ah, fascinating.
[4034.90 → 4035.90] Okay.
[4035.90 → 4037.90] So if we check our recordings...
[4037.90 → 4038.90] Our recordings probably clean.
[4038.90 → 4041.90] So if you want to see what you missed during the downtime...
[4041.90 → 4042.90] Yes.
[4042.90 → 4045.90] I'm not sure from what I got from Twitch chat and whatnot.
[4045.90 → 4048.90] If, like, I think for the most part, the video might have just cut out.
[4048.90 → 4049.90] Got it.
[4049.90 → 4050.90] I think they might have still been able to hear the audio.
[4050.90 → 4052.90] But when the ad rolled, obviously...
[4052.90 → 4054.90] Things got a little bit messy.
[4054.90 → 4055.90] So, guys, yeah.
[4055.90 → 4058.90] Do check out the archive if there was anything you missed during that segment.
[4058.90 → 4060.90] But I hope you found it educational.
[4060.90 → 4065.90] Honestly, for the time being, we're still going to be testing using Fraps because we don't have...
[4065.90 → 4074.90] It's a $2,000 capture card that Ryan's using in a separate PC that's hooked up to a 1TB RAID 0 SSD array.
[4074.90 → 4078.90] To give you guys some idea of the magnitude of hardware it takes to capture...
[4078.90 → 4083.90] To capture these frames as they're being displayed to the user.
[4083.90 → 4084.90] The way that he's doing it.
[4084.90 → 4086.90] He explains it fully in his articles.
[4086.90 → 4087.90] Yeah.
[4087.90 → 4088.90] So, yeah.
[4088.90 → 4092.90] We don't have that capture card, and we probably aren't investing in one anytime very soon.
[4092.90 → 4094.90] So we'll be using Fraps for now.
[4094.90 → 4096.90] However, we don't do much dual GPU testing.
[4096.90 → 4103.90] And as he mentioned, with single GPU, it's a much more accurate reflection than it is with dual GPU, particularly in Crossfire.
[4103.90 → 4107.90] If you check out his graphs, he shows the difference of...
[4107.90 → 4111.90] Like, he'll show width on each one of the bars as it goes along the graph.
[4111.90 → 4113.90] And the wider it is, the worse it is.
[4113.90 → 4116.90] And you see the AMD dual GPU is quite large.
[4116.90 → 4120.90] NVIDIA dual GPU is not that much bigger, but it's still noticeably bigger.
[4120.90 → 4122.90] And then the single GPUs are actually pretty tight.
[4122.90 → 4123.90] So, yeah.
[4123.90 → 4126.90] So, make of that what you will.
[4126.90 → 4128.90] And I'm going to be just...
[4128.90 → 4131.90] Let's do a little bit of Twitter chat since I'm just sort of tired.
[4131.90 → 4134.90] Okay, here we go.
[4134.90 → 4139.90] Keenan Myers asks if we can discuss DDoSing in a live stream or tech quickie.
[4139.90 → 4140.90] You know what?
[4140.90 → 4141.90] Why don't we discuss it right now?
[4141.90 → 4146.90] Slick, in a nutshell, if you had to explain it in 30 seconds or less, what is a DDoS?
[4146.90 → 4148.90] DDoS is distributed denial of service.
[4148.90 → 4154.90] Distributed denial of service means you lose internet because most likely your ISP is cutting it off from you because you are receiving way too many packets.
[4154.90 → 4156.90] An example of this was...
[4156.90 → 4160.90] I don't remember what they're actually called, but it's the guys that stop all the ridiculous things that are called.
[4160.90 → 4165.90] All the ridiculous, like, Viagra pills spam that you get in your email boxes.
[4165.90 → 4168.90] They were smashed at 300 gigabits per second.
[4168.90 → 4171.90] This was the largest recorded DDoS in history.
[4171.90 → 4172.90] Wow.
[4172.90 → 4174.90] And they just got crushed by someone.
[4174.90 → 4175.90] I don't...
[4175.90 → 4176.90] I haven't followed it up, so I don't know who it is.
[4176.90 → 4178.90] Or if they ever figured out who it was.
[4178.90 → 4183.90] But they basically were able to keep kind of going, but what I'm thinking is they were using an off-site.
[4183.90 → 4187.90] Because 300 gigabits per second, like, I don't know how you survive through that.
[4187.90 → 4190.90] Nothing else is going to squeeze out of your internet connection.
[4190.90 → 4191.90] Let's put it that way.
[4191.90 → 4198.90] The idea is that you're flooding the connection with packets from elsewhere, most likely with a botnet, which is just a gigantic link of computers.
[4198.90 → 4201.90] You've gone over 30 seconds, by the way, but carry on.
[4201.90 → 4208.90] Anyway, you're basically just disallowing someone to connect to the internet in a very intricate or not intricate way.
[4208.90 → 4211.90] And it's very frowned upon.
[4211.90 → 4212.90] It's not so good.
[4212.90 → 4214.90] You're not... you shouldn't do that.
[4214.90 → 4215.90] It's a bad thing.
[4215.90 → 4216.90] No.
[4216.90 → 4225.90] And it can be something as... like, it can be a botnet, which is what Slick alluded to, where you've got multiple computers that you control, and you're telling them all to slam it at the same time.
[4225.90 → 4233.90] Or it could even be something as simple as if I was on a live stream and I went, hey, everyone, go hit this website and start F5-ing.
[4233.90 → 4235.90] That would be a DDoS attack, essentially.
[4235.90 → 4237.90] And you're not... you're not really supposed to do that.
[4237.90 → 4238.90] Yeah, you're not allowed to do that.
[4238.90 → 4240.90] So that's a terrible thing.
[4240.90 → 4244.90] Why don't we move into our next discussion topic?
[4244.90 → 4246.90] And I think you know where I'm going with this.
[4246.90 → 4250.90] Tell me... you know what?
[4250.90 → 4251.90] Best segue ever.
[4251.90 → 4259.90] I would like them to watch this video and tell me if they think that the LinusTechTips.com forum is anything like this video.
[4259.90 → 4266.90] So let's just go check out... so this is vbulletin.com.
[4270.90 → 4273.90] All right, so view the video.
[4281.90 → 4282.90] Shut up!
[4282.90 → 4283.90] Bye.
[4283.90 → 4286.90] San jong Moon,
[4286.90 → 4309.90] Beat SPEAK bike
[4309.90 → 4339.58] That would be cool if that actually happened.
[4339.58 → 4341.58] Yeah, that would be a great cool forum.
[4341.72 → 4344.76] So I'm going to use this as my opportunity to announce
[4344.76 → 4348.42] that we are going to be migrating off of bulletin 5.
[4348.48 → 4351.84] I've asked them for a refund based on the fact that
[4351.84 → 4355.36] that demo has been up on their site since I purchased the software
[4355.36 → 4357.10] four months ago.
[4358.18 → 4362.50] Most of the functionality you saw there either isn't there at all
[4362.50 → 4363.82] or doesn't work correctly.
[4363.82 → 4368.24] Or barely works and Mr. Wizard and I have it hobbling along
[4368.24 → 4369.30] so that it somewhat works.
[4369.30 → 4375.04] Like with actual changes to the code of the forum software.
[4375.36 → 4377.78] Not to mention the admin tools they showed there.
[4377.84 → 4378.56] Weren't those great?
[4378.68 → 4379.50] Oh, they're fantastic.
[4379.78 → 4380.08] They didn't work.
[4380.18 → 4382.70] I'm pretty sure it's just actually done in Flash.
[4383.16 → 4386.76] And like just actually they just made a fake video of it.
[4386.92 → 4390.62] One of our mod team members even figured out like this weird
[4390.62 → 4393.78] backdoor way of like doing a few things in a certain order
[4393.78 → 4396.58] to be able to actually do something which they can't normally
[4396.58 → 4400.08] actually do which is just absurd.
[4400.26 → 4402.06] But like oh, it's horrible.
[4402.26 → 4403.46] So it barely works.
[4403.64 → 4404.66] It dies all the time.
[4404.94 → 4405.94] The thing just breaks.
[4406.22 → 4407.62] The database schema is terrible.
[4407.80 → 4409.96] So it just breaks and is huge.
[4409.96 → 4415.70] It sends 100 queries to my database every single time you load a page.
[4417.42 → 4419.50] Like let that sift through your brain for a second.
[4419.70 → 4421.08] Like the thing's just messed.
[4421.24 → 4424.30] So we're working with a few different other forum pieces of software.
[4424.44 → 4424.62] Yep.
[4424.62 → 4428.12] We're trying to get our forum so that it can be converted.
[4428.36 → 4431.60] No one right now can convert vBulletin5 to another software.
[4432.04 → 4435.58] Partly because of the issues that there are with it.
[4435.76 → 4440.78] I mean to give you guys some idea how unstable the vBulletin5 forum.
[4440.94 → 4445.42] There's probably LinusTechTips.com is the largest forum on the internet
[4445.42 → 4446.68] running vBulletin5.
[4447.08 → 4447.94] Running vBulletin5.
[4448.00 → 4448.12] Yeah.
[4448.24 → 4449.16] We're not actually the line.
[4449.16 → 4453.98] And probably the second-largest forum running vBulletin5 is actually their own forum.
[4454.60 → 4459.30] And I mean if anywhere near the kind of traffic that hits our forum,
[4459.58 → 4461.72] hit their forum, I suspect it would just die.
[4462.38 → 4464.00] So yeah.
[4464.38 → 4465.46] So basically, right.
[4465.70 → 4468.58] So I asked for a refund on the basis that A,
[4469.10 → 4472.20] it didn't deliver what I asked for or what they promised.
[4472.68 → 4475.42] I mean when we were in beta, it was one thing.
[4476.32 → 4478.52] Slick was working directly with their devs,
[4478.52 → 4480.48] daily communication pretty much, correct?
[4480.70 → 4480.80] Pretty much.
[4481.22 → 4482.06] Submitting bug reports.
[4482.18 → 4484.38] I submit so many bug reports I can't even remember.
[4484.56 → 4484.86] Hundreds.
[4485.64 → 4488.14] Slick had access to the change logs
[4488.14 → 4490.56] so that he could actually see what was being worked on,
[4490.62 → 4491.38] see what was fixed.
[4492.00 → 4493.96] And like the best part was like,
[4494.06 → 4497.28] okay, like frequent forum members will know this.
[4497.34 → 4498.78] If you go to a thread,
[4499.34 → 4501.36] it will show like one page.
[4501.42 → 4503.24] You click next, it's like 17 pages
[4503.24 → 4505.66] because their page thing just doesn't work properly.
[4505.80 → 4507.64] There are tons of other problems with their page thing.
[4507.64 → 4508.18] It's incredible.
[4510.52 → 4515.42] And like that got moved from like log to log
[4515.42 → 4516.32] with them saying,
[4516.66 → 4519.06] oh yeah, this is fixed and working in the dev environment.
[4519.34 → 4521.04] And then the patch comes out, and it's like,
[4521.14 → 4522.80] oh weird, I don't see this in the patch notes.
[4522.96 → 4525.08] And then you see the work log for the next one
[4525.08 → 4526.30] and that's back in there.
[4526.36 → 4527.42] It's like, oh, it's not working.
[4528.32 → 4530.34] And then right before that patch gets released,
[4530.46 → 4532.06] this is working in the dev environment.
[4532.28 → 4534.54] Right when that patch actually hits your computer,
[4534.54 → 4536.22] you check the changelog again, it's not there.
[4536.52 → 4538.88] You check the work log for the next patch,
[4539.28 → 4539.90] not working.
[4540.48 → 4542.82] Every single time the page thing still doesn't work
[4542.82 → 4543.78] and we're in gold release.
[4543.92 → 4544.78] This isn't gold release.
[4544.88 → 4546.00] This is like alpha.
[4546.26 → 4548.14] This is, yeah, it's not gold release.
[4548.44 → 4550.90] So in beta, we were putting up with it
[4550.90 → 4552.22] because we were like, okay, well,
[4552.22 → 4555.22] we understand that when we paid for the software,
[4555.44 → 4559.04] it was a Bulletin 4 and Bulletin 5 license.
[4559.18 → 4561.70] We decided to go for gold with Bulletin 5
[4561.70 → 4562.68] and see if we could get it going
[4562.68 → 4565.04] based on that it was supposed to do all the things
[4565.04 → 4567.02] that we saw in the demo video, which it didn't.
[4569.40 → 4572.46] And pretty much when it hit gold
[4572.46 → 4575.10] and it still didn't work at all,
[4575.18 → 4577.12] that was when we got pretty upset.
[4577.38 → 4580.04] And then Slick's contacts on the dev team
[4580.04 → 4581.48] started just disappearing.
[4581.70 → 4584.04] So one guy that I was in direct email contact with
[4584.04 → 4585.72] through their ticketing system,
[4585.82 → 4587.38] but their ticketing system just pushes the email,
[4587.50 → 4588.24] direct email contact,
[4588.52 → 4589.98] just stopped answering straight up.
[4590.20 → 4592.98] And then my access to the tracker,
[4593.70 → 4595.52] which is their like changelog
[4595.52 → 4598.28] and what we're currently working on
[4598.28 → 4601.24] and like the way I submit bug reports,
[4601.34 → 4602.10] I think there's another way,
[4602.18 → 4603.52] but that's how I would submit bug reports
[4603.52 → 4604.90] just kind of disappeared.
[4606.06 → 4607.86] And like there's a lot of people going like,
[4607.98 → 4609.16] where's the tracker guys?
[4609.16 → 4611.44] So, yeah.
[4611.62 → 4614.48] So basically they're refusing to issue a refund
[4614.48 → 4617.16] because they don't issue refunds
[4617.76 → 4620.38] in spite of the fact that just in the
[4620.44 → 4623.56] like in the dollars that I pay Slick alone,
[4624.28 → 4626.60] I've spent more than the $250
[4626.60 → 4628.78] that their stupid worthless software costs.
[4629.16 → 4631.70] And just in the dollars that Slick's devoted
[4631.70 → 4633.88] his own time to just keeping the forum working
[4633.88 → 4636.04] for our community who we're still dedicated
[4636.04 → 4638.30] to delivering an awesome forum to at some point.
[4638.54 → 4639.54] Just in terms of that,
[4639.60 → 4640.24] I mean, how much,
[4640.56 → 4642.26] how much money do they owe us?
[4642.68 → 4643.38] Oh, ridiculous.
[4643.58 → 4646.48] I've spent hours every day after work
[4646.48 → 4647.54] just trying to make stuff works.
[4647.96 → 4649.26] And I mean,
[4649.32 → 4651.06] in the amount of dev work
[4651.06 → 4652.76] that we've actually contributed
[4652.76 → 4655.02] to making Bulletin 5 work.
[4655.02 → 4655.88] And beta testing.
[4656.00 → 4657.36] We've submitted so many bug reports.
[4657.36 → 4661.00] The $250 should be actually not that big of a deal
[4661.00 → 4661.88] and it's pretty upsetting.
[4662.02 → 4662.14] I mean,
[4662.20 → 4663.88] I didn't really want to talk about this,
[4664.38 → 4666.80] but I've had a few emails back and forth
[4666.80 → 4668.02] with their support team
[4668.02 → 4669.54] where I emailed in saying,
[4669.70 → 4669.84] look,
[4669.88 → 4671.30] I really think this is ridiculous.
[4671.48 → 4672.58] Here are all the reasons why.
[4673.06 → 4674.58] We are abandoning ship
[4674.58 → 4675.60] because quite frankly,
[4675.72 → 4677.06] you guys released a gold release
[4677.06 → 4678.42] that is totally unacceptable
[4678.42 → 4680.00] and doesn't work.
[4680.22 → 4682.04] Basic things like being able to navigate
[4682.04 → 4683.68] to a different page in a forum thread
[4683.68 → 4684.64] need to just work.
[4684.98 → 4685.82] Do you want to hear something funny?
[4686.02 → 4686.24] Sure.
[4686.32 → 4687.64] My mod team just told me this.
[4687.74 → 4688.72] Apparently it's a new thing
[4688.72 → 4689.88] that they figured out very recently.
[4690.00 → 4690.66] I didn't know this.
[4691.24 → 4692.60] Mods can make themselves
[4692.60 → 4694.72] through the mod control panel admins.
[4695.40 → 4695.78] Oh yeah.
[4696.30 → 4697.00] Which is just like,
[4697.44 → 4697.60] what?
[4697.84 → 4698.40] That's like,
[4698.48 → 4700.82] that's a complete forum breaking bug.
[4700.82 → 4703.30] Like luckily all my mods
[4703.30 → 4705.02] are good guys.
[4706.08 → 4706.56] But like,
[4706.80 → 4707.34] that's brutal.
[4707.80 → 4708.32] For instance,
[4708.50 → 4709.56] some people were wondering like,
[4709.62 → 4711.00] why don't we just burn and run?
[4711.72 → 4713.40] I do not want to do that.
[4713.50 → 4714.74] I want to try and convert the forum
[4714.74 → 4715.92] as hard as we possibly can
[4715.92 → 4718.06] because we have 15,000 users
[4718.06 → 4720.30] and it doesn't really feel like it,
[4720.36 → 4722.50] but we have 112,000 posts
[4722.50 → 4723.58] on the forum.
[4723.74 → 4724.74] So that's an average
[4724.74 → 4726.90] of about 1,000 posts a day
[4726.90 → 4727.68] since we launched.
[4727.80 → 4729.26] It's an extremely active forum.
[4729.68 → 4730.48] Our forum members
[4730.48 → 4731.96] are doing such an awesome job
[4731.96 → 4732.76] helping each other,
[4732.88 → 4733.78] supporting each other.
[4734.14 → 4734.44] I mean,
[4734.50 → 4735.82] the goal was to make it
[4735.82 → 4737.64] a truly friendly place
[4737.64 → 4738.98] to ask a question
[4738.98 → 4740.54] and get an answer
[4740.54 → 4741.28] without,
[4741.50 → 4741.76] you know,
[4741.84 → 4742.88] that snobby attitude.
[4742.88 → 4744.26] That's still what I envision
[4744.26 → 4744.94] for this forum
[4744.94 → 4746.64] and people have just been so awesome
[4746.64 → 4747.66] that it would be,
[4747.68 → 4748.70] it would be devastating
[4748.70 → 4750.12] to everyone involved
[4750.12 → 4751.34] to have that wiped out
[4751.34 → 4752.30] and to have to start over
[4752.30 → 4753.76] and I don't want to ask you guys
[4753.76 → 4754.22] to do that.
[4754.34 → 4755.36] And the mini communities
[4755.36 → 4756.04] that have built out
[4756.04 → 4756.66] of little forums
[4756.66 → 4757.84] like the folding forum,
[4757.84 → 4758.84] build logs,
[4759.12 → 4760.20] operating systems,
[4760.40 → 4761.86] like everyone,
[4762.12 → 4762.46] basically,
[4762.56 → 4763.20] the mini communities
[4763.20 → 4764.02] that have been created
[4764.02 → 4765.42] to lose some of those posts
[4765.42 → 4766.24] would just be brutal.
[4766.66 → 4767.50] And like losing people's
[4767.50 → 4768.36] entire user accounts,
[4768.48 → 4769.68] everyone losing their post counts,
[4769.80 → 4770.48] post counts matter.
[4770.66 → 4771.24] Their PMs?
[4771.30 → 4772.42] Even though Bulletin
[4772.42 → 4775.08] is not accurate at all
[4775.08 → 4776.22] when it calculates post counts,
[4776.30 → 4777.00] they still matter
[4777.00 → 4777.52] because they're still
[4777.52 → 4778.48] somewhere around
[4778.48 → 4780.22] generally where your post count
[4780.22 → 4780.88] probably is,
[4780.96 → 4782.04] plus or minus like 600,
[4782.22 → 4782.60] but whatever.
[4782.60 → 4784.96] I'm done raging
[4784.96 → 4785.88] at Bulletin's database.
[4786.00 → 4786.48] Probably not,
[4786.60 → 4787.30] but still.
[4787.68 → 4787.98] So,
[4788.78 → 4791.56] let's change,
[4791.66 → 4792.22] let's take this
[4792.22 → 4793.04] into our discussion
[4793.04 → 4795.14] about why you shouldn't
[4795.14 → 4795.82] buy a game
[4795.82 → 4797.26] based on pre-rendered cinematic.
[4798.40 → 4798.84] Okay.
[4799.00 → 4799.28] So,
[4799.44 → 4800.02] you know what?
[4800.58 → 4802.48] I've ranted about this before.
[4802.84 → 4803.06] I've,
[4803.10 → 4804.32] how many times have I said
[4804.32 → 4805.86] it totally doesn't matter
[4805.86 → 4806.82] because it's a pre-game,
[4807.02 → 4807.34] it's a
[4807.40 → 4807.88] it's a
[4807.88 → 4808.52] it's a rendered,
[4808.78 → 4809.64] pre-rendered cinematic.
[4809.96 → 4810.78] It's funny because you're,
[4811.00 → 4811.20] yeah,
[4811.26 → 4811.66] I know,
[4811.66 → 4811.96] I know,
[4812.02 → 4813.26] this is going to be a burn on me.
[4813.36 → 4813.66] I know.
[4814.74 → 4815.62] You've said that a lot.
[4815.72 → 4816.68] Pretty much every single time
[4816.68 → 4817.98] I look at like anything
[4817.98 → 4818.68] to do with a game
[4818.68 → 4819.38] that's not released yet.
[4819.42 → 4819.68] He's like,
[4819.74 → 4819.92] oh,
[4820.36 → 4821.20] is that in-game cinematic?
[4821.34 → 4821.64] And I'm like,
[4822.16 → 4822.46] no.
[4822.72 → 4822.96] He's like,
[4823.00 → 4823.66] then it sucks.
[4823.76 → 4824.12] He'll talk,
[4824.20 → 4825.18] he'll talk about an event.
[4825.26 → 4825.58] He'll be like,
[4825.62 → 4825.70] yeah,
[4825.70 → 4826.30] I'm going to PAX.
[4826.34 → 4826.86] And I'll be like,
[4827.18 → 4827.48] so?
[4828.00 → 4828.66] They're going to show you
[4828.66 → 4829.32] a bunch of stuff
[4829.32 → 4830.20] that actually probably
[4830.20 → 4831.12] has nothing to do
[4831.12 → 4832.30] with the actual release game.
[4832.40 → 4832.56] Ah,
[4832.56 → 4833.32] hold on.
[4833.54 → 4834.80] PAX has a lot of playable stuff.
[4834.92 → 4835.12] Okay,
[4835.18 → 4835.84] playable stuff,
[4835.92 → 4836.48] but that doesn't be,
[4836.48 → 4836.74] I mean,
[4836.82 → 4837.06] okay,
[4837.42 → 4837.60] hey,
[4837.76 → 4838.44] key example,
[4838.78 → 4839.80] V Bulletin 5.
[4840.56 → 4841.48] It wasn't playable.
[4841.84 → 4842.12] Okay,
[4842.26 → 4843.44] it all looked pretty playable.
[4844.08 → 4844.52] Anyway,
[4844.82 → 4845.78] the point is,
[4846.22 → 4847.06] this is,
[4847.38 → 4848.00] for the
[4848.44 → 4849.18] you know what,
[4849.20 → 4850.18] I don't think I got sucked in
[4850.18 → 4850.94] with Bios hock 2
[4850.94 → 4851.56] by Cinematic.
[4852.56 → 4853.04] You got sucked in
[4853.04 → 4853.70] because Bios hock 1
[4853.70 → 4854.12] was so good.
[4854.16 → 4854.30] Well,
[4854.30 → 4855.52] I hadn't played Bios hock 1 yet,
[4855.56 → 4856.46] but I'd heard it was great.
[4856.86 → 4858.58] So I bought Bios hock 2
[4858.58 → 4859.56] because Bios hock 1
[4859.56 → 4860.22] was supposedly great.
[4860.26 → 4860.48] Anyway,
[4861.00 → 4862.80] so this is the first time
[4862.80 → 4863.82] in my life
[4863.82 → 4864.86] that I have been
[4864.86 → 4865.68] hardcore
[4866.48 → 4868.14] in by pre-rendered cinematic.
[4868.76 → 4869.88] V Bulletin 5,
[4870.44 → 4871.56] gold star for you,
[4871.78 → 4872.42] you got me
[4872.42 → 4873.78] because pre-rendered cinematic
[4873.78 → 4874.34] are stupid
[4874.34 → 4875.50] and that video
[4875.50 → 4876.66] we showed you guys earlier
[4876.66 → 4877.84] was basically,
[4878.20 → 4879.14] it should have said,
[4879.38 → 4880.04] asterisk,
[4880.40 → 4881.66] not in-game footage
[4881.66 → 4882.86] in the bottom right corner
[4882.86 → 4883.98] because it wasn't.
[4884.80 → 4885.98] It's basically like
[4885.98 → 4886.76] as if I bought
[4886.76 → 4888.32] the new Final Fantasy game
[4888.32 → 4889.22] because it had
[4889.22 → 4890.00] a great trailer.
[4890.86 → 4892.16] No offence to Square Enix,
[4892.24 → 4893.10] but you guys have become
[4893.10 → 4893.96] a trailer company.
[4895.10 → 4896.24] And I mean like
[4896.24 → 4896.78] trailer,
[4897.08 → 4897.94] like that you park
[4897.94 → 4898.50] at a park.
[4899.74 → 4900.14] No,
[4900.20 → 4900.72] because they still
[4900.72 → 4901.50] ball so hard
[4901.50 → 4901.96] because they get
[4901.96 → 4902.50] so much money
[4902.50 → 4902.86] from people
[4902.86 → 4903.58] who keep buying them.
[4904.14 → 4905.32] I haven't played
[4905.32 → 4906.04] the recent ones,
[4906.10 → 4907.14] so I cannot comment
[4907.14 → 4907.72] on this because
[4907.72 → 4908.28] I have not played
[4908.28 → 4909.12] the new Final Fantasy.
[4909.12 → 4910.04] I actually haven't
[4910.04 → 4911.54] bought a Final Fantasy game
[4911.54 → 4912.28] since 6.
[4914.16 → 4914.56] How?
[4915.08 → 4915.52] What?
[4915.52 → 4916.58] How can you comment then?
[4916.62 → 4917.46] I borrowed 7.
[4918.36 → 4920.28] I borrowed 9.
[4920.60 → 4920.92] Okay.
[4921.38 → 4922.82] I borrowed 10.
[4923.84 → 4924.30] But I mean,
[4924.36 → 4924.82] quite frankly,
[4924.90 → 4925.06] okay,
[4925.12 → 4925.84] I should have paid money
[4925.84 → 4926.98] for 9 because 9 was awesome.
[4927.12 → 4927.56] I played,
[4927.72 → 4928.74] I don't remember the name.
[4929.30 → 4929.50] 8?
[4929.64 → 4930.06] It sucks.
[4930.18 → 4930.54] No, no, no,
[4930.54 → 4930.90] not that.
[4931.06 → 4931.90] Final Fantasy 8.
[4931.90 → 4933.30] I played a fairly new one.
[4933.62 → 4934.36] I think it might have been 11.
[4935.30 → 4935.90] I never played 11.
[4935.90 → 4936.24] I don't remember the number,
[4936.44 → 4937.50] but I played it on a console
[4937.50 → 4938.64] and there was the like
[4938.64 → 4939.66] autoplay button.
[4939.88 → 4940.56] Did you ever play Tactics?
[4940.56 → 4941.48] I crushed my soul.
[4942.08 → 4942.50] Yes.
[4942.74 → 4943.44] I like Tactics.
[4943.68 → 4944.74] Final Fantasy Tactics
[4944.74 → 4945.66] is the opposite
[4945.66 → 4946.64] of the autoplay button.
[4946.80 → 4947.66] It actually makes
[4947.66 → 4948.86] turn-based combat
[4948.86 → 4951.06] just ridiculously fun
[4951.06 → 4951.60] and challenging.
[4951.80 → 4952.50] Wait, before we continue,
[4952.68 → 4953.52] I need to pause.
[4953.72 → 4954.34] Are we going to hit
[4954.34 → 4955.12] V-Bullets in 5
[4955.12 → 4956.14] with how much we hate them again?
[4956.32 → 4956.94] No, I'm going to hit
[4956.94 → 4957.92] one of my mods
[4957.92 → 4958.40] with like,
[4958.48 → 4959.24] thank you, dude.
[4959.60 → 4960.12] For the pizza?
[4960.68 → 4960.86] No.
[4960.86 → 4961.50] The oyster pizza?
[4961.84 → 4962.74] That was really
[4962.74 → 4963.66] kind of rank-tasting,
[4963.84 → 4964.10] actually,
[4964.20 → 4964.72] if we're going to be
[4964.72 → 4965.60] completely honest.
[4965.94 → 4966.60] Knowing Pan ago,
[4966.70 → 4967.24] those might be
[4967.24 → 4968.06] old oysters.
[4968.82 → 4969.12] Oh.
[4969.64 → 4969.86] Yeah.
[4969.86 → 4970.70] Maybe that's the issue.
[4970.70 → 4971.58] That might be part of the problem
[4971.58 → 4972.44] or all the problem.
[4972.58 → 4973.16] It is Pan ago.
[4973.44 → 4973.98] It's Pan ago.
[4974.28 → 4974.44] Yeah.
[4974.54 → 4974.98] Either way,
[4975.08 → 4976.38] we do really appreciate
[4976.38 → 4976.84] the thought
[4976.84 → 4977.60] and it was hilarious.
[4977.88 → 4979.02] That was legitimately
[4979.02 → 4979.32] really fun.
[4979.32 → 4979.82] For those of you
[4979.82 → 4981.02] who weren't on the live stream yet,
[4981.08 → 4981.74] our mod team
[4981.74 → 4982.80] sent us pizza
[4982.80 → 4984.10] because we had had
[4984.10 → 4984.86] a discussion about
[4984.86 → 4985.48] how when you order
[4985.48 → 4986.14] things online
[4986.14 → 4986.74] it should like
[4986.74 → 4987.46] come with a pizza.
[4987.72 → 4987.88] Yeah.
[4988.00 → 4989.24] Anyway, carry on.
[4989.34 → 4990.14] Okay, so
[4990.14 → 4991.82] Winspeed36
[4991.82 → 4992.84] on the forums
[4992.84 → 4994.34] has stepped up
[4994.34 → 4995.38] and is going to help us
[4995.38 → 4996.74] host our forum
[4996.74 → 4997.52] when we get our new
[4997.52 → 4998.36] software running up.
[4998.36 → 5000.08] So whoever we end up
[5000.08 → 5000.60] going with,
[5000.70 → 5001.74] whoever we convert
[5001.74 → 5002.82] our forum to,
[5003.32 → 5005.14] Win speedy's going to host
[5005.14 → 5005.68] the new forum
[5005.68 → 5006.34] because right now
[5006.34 → 5007.06] we have it running
[5007.06 → 5009.44] on a dusty rack
[5009.44 → 5010.64] in a corner
[5010.64 → 5012.16] of the NCI warehouse.
[5012.96 → 5015.00] So that kind of works.
[5015.20 → 5015.94] And I can throw
[5015.94 → 5017.02] USB drives at it
[5017.02 → 5017.40] from there
[5017.40 → 5018.32] so that's a big problem.
[5018.48 → 5020.16] And that can shut it down.
[5021.52 → 5022.46] Which is not good.
[5022.46 → 5026.10] So we're going to get
[5026.10 → 5026.62] rack space
[5026.62 → 5027.30] which is like
[5027.30 → 5029.44] absolutely fantastic.
[5029.58 → 5030.06] The rack space
[5030.06 → 5030.84] will be in the States.
[5030.86 → 5031.02] What is it like
[5031.02 → 5032.30] 100 up, 100 down
[5032.30 → 5032.84] or something stupid
[5032.84 → 5033.18] like that?
[5033.20 → 5034.10] It's just so beast.
[5034.22 → 5034.32] Yeah.
[5034.50 → 5035.36] And like it has
[5035.36 → 5036.54] its own power supply.
[5037.22 → 5037.56] Eight cores.
[5038.68 → 5039.08] Boost.
[5039.30 → 5040.54] It has its own power supply
[5040.54 → 5041.74] and an uninterruptible
[5041.74 → 5042.38] power supply
[5042.38 → 5043.06] and then a
[5043.06 → 5044.76] gas backup?
[5045.06 → 5045.28] Diesel.
[5045.54 → 5046.12] Diesel backup.
[5046.32 → 5046.68] I don't remember
[5046.68 → 5047.18] which one it was.
[5047.96 → 5048.94] So it's just like
[5048.94 → 5049.70] holy cow
[5049.70 → 5050.52] power shouldn't
[5050.52 → 5051.32] really be a problem.
[5051.60 → 5052.84] It's a green power place
[5052.84 → 5053.82] so they get a lot of
[5053.82 → 5055.30] energy from wind and solar
[5055.30 → 5055.92] which is also
[5055.92 → 5056.62] kind of cool
[5056.62 → 5057.58] because that matters.
[5058.18 → 5058.42] Earth.
[5058.42 → 5059.14] A lot of power.
[5059.32 → 5059.68] Fire.
[5060.34 → 5060.68] Wind.
[5061.08 → 5061.40] Water.
[5061.68 → 5062.04] Heart.
[5062.36 → 5063.34] What kind of power
[5063.34 → 5063.98] is heart?
[5064.98 → 5065.98] I mean come on.
[5066.74 → 5067.74] I mean, and he was like
[5067.74 → 5068.42] The power of love.
[5068.84 → 5069.82] Do you know the reference?
[5069.94 → 5070.48] I think so.
[5070.50 → 5071.16] Yeah Captain Planet?
[5071.24 → 5071.42] Yeah.
[5071.50 → 5072.12] Okay yeah yeah
[5072.12 → 5072.60] I mean come on
[5072.60 → 5073.54] heart power?
[5073.78 → 5074.40] And then in the
[5074.40 → 5075.42] in the intro sequence
[5075.42 → 5076.30] he like takes his ring
[5076.30 → 5076.72] and what is he
[5076.72 → 5077.28] points it at like
[5077.28 → 5078.10] two rats, and they're
[5078.10 → 5078.64] fighting and then
[5078.64 → 5079.06] they're not or
[5079.06 → 5079.84] something stupid like
[5079.84 → 5080.06] that.
[5080.54 → 5081.58] Absolutely ridiculous.
[5081.82 → 5082.94] It's like earth,
[5083.08 → 5084.70] water, wind, fire
[5084.70 → 5085.46] and like
[5085.46 → 5087.60] heart.
[5087.90 → 5088.26] Love.
[5088.76 → 5090.22] So anyway yeah.
[5090.36 → 5090.66] It's like he's
[5090.66 → 5091.16] like he's probably
[5091.16 → 5091.64] a barony.
[5093.56 → 5094.40] If that was even
[5094.40 → 5095.04] a thing at the time.
[5095.06 → 5095.56] He predates
[5095.56 → 5096.10] bronzes.
[5096.26 → 5096.94] He was the
[5096.94 → 5097.88] original barony.
[5097.90 → 5098.24] The original barony.
[5099.52 → 5100.36] He should become
[5100.36 → 5101.14] their poster boy.
[5101.32 → 5102.00] Anyway thanks
[5102.00 → 5102.40] Wind speed.
[5102.92 → 5103.86] Way to go Wind speed.
[5103.96 → 5104.50] Once the new
[5104.50 → 5105.24] forum software is
[5105.24 → 5106.10] running up and once
[5106.10 → 5106.82] we're on a rack
[5106.82 → 5108.08] that should be like
[5108.08 → 5108.66] solid.
[5108.66 → 5109.48] Kind of the end
[5109.48 → 5110.58] of the issues.
[5110.66 → 5111.48] I will finally be
[5111.48 → 5112.06] able to be proud
[5112.06 → 5112.60] of my forum.
[5112.96 → 5113.60] Not that I'm not
[5113.60 → 5114.14] proud of my forum.
[5114.26 → 5115.08] I'll finally be able
[5115.08 → 5116.02] to look at my forum
[5116.02 → 5117.44] and have it be online.
[5117.66 → 5118.44] Sorry whose forum now?
[5118.48 → 5119.18] For the entirety.
[5119.72 → 5120.36] Oh come on.
[5120.82 → 5122.00] It has my name on it.
[5122.00 → 5123.46] I dev'd the whole thing
[5123.46 → 5124.48] and Mr. Wizard.
[5124.62 → 5125.22] How about we agree
[5125.22 → 5125.96] that we'll share it.
[5126.06 → 5126.28] Okay.
[5126.42 → 5126.70] Okay.
[5126.98 → 5127.20] Okay.
[5127.32 → 5127.68] There you go.
[5127.68 → 5129.68] So I'd like to move
[5129.68 → 5130.70] on to our next topic
[5130.70 → 5132.84] which is that Slick
[5132.84 → 5133.92] is fired for thinking
[5133.92 → 5135.20] my forum belongs to him
[5135.20 → 5137.36] but also that your
[5137.36 → 5139.02] new Blackberry could
[5139.02 → 5139.80] be telling your
[5139.80 → 5140.72] friends that you're
[5140.72 → 5141.68] watching porn.
[5142.08 → 5143.10] So this was an
[5143.10 → 5143.62] article on
[5143.62 → 5145.46] geektown.ca where
[5145.46 → 5147.64] they showed how
[5147.64 → 5149.34] the, ahem, so it
[5149.34 → 5150.34] was posted by a user
[5150.34 → 5151.50] at crackberry.com
[5151.50 → 5153.24] and a screen grab on
[5153.24 → 5154.66] the site, on the
[5154.66 → 5155.66] site, no it's a good
[5155.66 → 5156.66] site, on the site
[5156.66 → 5157.54] shows that someone's
[5157.54 → 5158.52] status was updated
[5158.52 → 5159.46] with what they were
[5159.46 → 5160.54] watching or listening
[5160.54 → 5161.68] to using their
[5161.68 → 5162.12] Blackberry.
[5162.22 → 5162.92] So there were status
[5162.92 → 5163.48] updates like
[5163.48 → 5164.00] listening to
[5164.00 → 5165.52] tube8.com or
[5165.52 → 5166.34] is listening to
[5166.34 → 5168.10] Pornhub and what
[5168.10 → 5168.96] the problem stems
[5168.96 → 5169.58] from the fact that
[5169.58 → 5170.56] the latest Blackberry
[5170.56 → 5171.90] OS offers to share
[5171.90 → 5173.22] your music listening
[5173.22 → 5174.24] habits to your
[5174.24 → 5174.98] Blackberry Messenger
[5174.98 → 5175.82] contacts.
[5176.34 → 5177.34] And I mean, I'm not,
[5177.44 → 5178.04] I don't know anyone
[5178.04 → 5178.72] who's still using
[5178.72 → 5179.44] Blackberry Messenger
[5179.44 → 5181.04] but if you were
[5181.04 → 5182.92] then you, and you
[5182.92 → 5183.88] were doing anything
[5183.88 → 5184.92] untoward on your
[5184.92 → 5186.02] phone, it would just
[5186.02 → 5187.18] be blasting that out
[5187.18 → 5187.92] to all of your
[5187.92 → 5188.12] friends.
[5188.20 → 5189.06] So if you're using
[5189.06 → 5189.78] a Blackberry and
[5189.78 → 5190.42] you've enabled that
[5190.42 → 5190.88] option and you
[5190.88 → 5191.62] haven't already done
[5191.62 → 5193.68] this, then please,
[5194.04 → 5195.82] please disable that
[5195.82 → 5198.78] option or go to a
[5198.78 → 5199.46] different website
[5199.46 → 5200.76] because holy crap,
[5200.84 → 5201.36] that's awesome.
[5201.90 → 5203.02] So I'm assuming it's
[5203.02 → 5203.86] just grabbing anything
[5203.86 → 5204.70] you stream at that
[5204.70 → 5204.92] point.
[5205.04 → 5205.26] Yes.
[5205.40 → 5206.16] And it just grabs
[5206.16 → 5207.48] the initial URL.
[5207.86 → 5208.12] Yes.
[5208.66 → 5209.48] So it just tells you
[5209.48 → 5209.94] the site.
[5210.06 → 5211.08] So as long as the
[5211.08 → 5212.42] porn you're watching
[5212.42 → 5213.46] is from like
[5213.46 → 5218.14] happyadventuretimechannel.com
[5218.14 → 5219.64] Happy Adventure Time?
[5219.80 → 5221.00] Okay, well, you know
[5221.00 → 5221.10] what?
[5221.10 → 5221.50] I don't want to know
[5221.50 → 5222.58] what that, I don't
[5222.58 → 5223.24] know.
[5223.36 → 5224.24] Okay, well that could
[5224.24 → 5224.98] be a porn site.
[5225.24 → 5226.28] Leave Finn alone.
[5226.64 → 5227.92] Leave Bubblegum alone.
[5228.02 → 5228.82] No, I didn't even mean
[5228.82 → 5229.70] that Adventure Time.
[5229.80 → 5230.46] Oh, that would be
[5230.46 → 5230.84] terrible.
[5231.88 → 5232.70] That's horrible.
[5232.82 → 5233.48] There needs to be,
[5233.48 → 5234.60] there needs to be no
[5234.60 → 5235.38] DeviantArt.
[5235.62 → 5236.08] No.
[5236.68 → 5237.10] Anything.
[5237.42 → 5237.64] No.
[5238.04 → 5238.96] There probably is.
[5239.32 → 5240.18] I don't, I don't
[5240.18 → 5240.74] want to know.
[5240.78 → 5241.60] That's the saddest
[5241.60 → 5241.84] thing.
[5242.00 → 5242.76] It's like their limbs
[5242.76 → 5243.96] aren't even anatomically
[5243.96 → 5244.38] correct.
[5244.62 → 5245.86] They can stay away.
[5246.72 → 5248.76] I will stay here and
[5248.76 → 5249.60] I will be fine.
[5250.32 → 5251.24] Mr. Bub, Mrs.
[5251.32 → 5252.18] Bubblegum can stay
[5252.18 → 5252.54] fine.
[5252.84 → 5253.46] Finn can stay fine.
[5253.46 → 5254.06] It's not Mrs.
[5254.12 → 5254.70] Bubblegum, it's
[5254.70 → 5255.66] Princess Bubblegum.
[5255.86 → 5256.48] Princess Bubblegum.
[5256.50 → 5257.50] Get her sort of.
[5257.92 → 5258.32] Waters.
[5258.50 → 5259.32] Right, right.
[5259.56 → 5260.34] Oh, come on.
[5260.86 → 5261.66] I've been signed
[5261.66 → 5262.82] to, sign in to your
[5262.82 → 5263.34] account for my other
[5263.34 → 5263.54] title.
[5263.68 → 5264.12] I guess I don't even
[5264.12 → 5264.46] have to.
[5265.54 → 5267.68] Um, ah, Facebook
[5267.68 → 5268.66] phone images have
[5268.66 → 5269.46] started to surface.
[5269.86 → 5270.98] So this is pretty
[5270.98 → 5271.80] cool, guys.
[5271.88 → 5272.42] We're going to go
[5272.42 → 5273.14] back to the
[5273.14 → 5273.66] live streamer.
[5273.70 → 5274.06] You know what?
[5274.24 → 5274.84] I'm just going to do
[5274.84 → 5275.06] this.
[5275.08 → 5275.78] I'm going to grab a
[5275.78 → 5276.66] screen region here
[5276.66 → 5277.12] and I'm going to go
[5277.12 → 5277.50] like that.
[5277.58 → 5278.06] There we go.
[5278.64 → 5279.00] Bam.
[5280.00 → 5281.42] So the, uh, the
[5281.42 → 5282.58] Facebook phone, which
[5282.58 → 5283.58] was rumoured for a
[5283.58 → 5283.92] long time.
[5283.96 → 5284.46] I'm just going to sit
[5284.46 → 5284.68] up here.
[5284.94 → 5285.66] You're almost like
[5285.66 → 5286.42] Wilson from home
[5286.42 → 5286.66] moving.
[5286.70 → 5286.94] Success.
[5287.04 → 5287.38] Yeah, I know.
[5287.50 → 5288.30] You'll never see my,
[5288.34 → 5288.96] you'll never see my
[5288.96 → 5289.18] mouth.
[5289.30 → 5290.48] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[5290.52 → 5291.00] I'm spinning.
[5291.42 → 5291.94] I can't stop
[5291.94 → 5292.22] spinning.
[5292.80 → 5294.14] Um, so this was
[5294.14 → 5295.14] rumoured for a long
[5295.14 → 5296.94] time when the face,
[5296.94 → 5297.50] there was going to
[5297.50 → 5298.28] be a Facebook phone
[5298.28 → 5299.52] and it looks like it
[5299.52 → 5300.86] has materialized in a
[5300.86 → 5301.54] hardware form.
[5301.60 → 5302.00] It's going to be
[5302.00 → 5303.56] available in red,
[5303.70 → 5304.86] silver, and a light
[5304.86 → 5305.18] blue.
[5305.44 → 5307.08] And this is where I
[5307.08 → 5308.00] think Apple may
[5308.00 → 5309.16] actually have some
[5309.16 → 5310.12] ground to stand on
[5310.12 → 5310.90] because that thing
[5310.90 → 5311.56] looks like a
[5311.56 → 5312.34] freaking iPhone.
[5314.58 → 5315.02] Yeah.
[5315.34 → 5316.42] It also has the
[5316.42 → 5317.16] two soft buttons on
[5317.16 → 5317.32] the side.
[5317.36 → 5318.08] Oh, is that a hard
[5318.08 → 5318.62] button in the middle?
[5318.96 → 5319.84] Yeah, I don't know,
[5319.92 → 5321.18] but it looks an awful
[5321.18 → 5322.00] lot like it.
[5322.02 → 5322.40] Look at where the
[5322.46 → 5323.02] look at the lock
[5323.02 → 5323.40] button.
[5324.52 → 5325.58] It also looks an
[5325.58 → 5326.36] awful lot like an
[5326.36 → 5326.90] Android phone.
[5326.94 → 5327.12] though.
[5327.42 → 5328.32] Yeah, but okay,
[5328.40 → 5328.70] come on.
[5328.78 → 5329.42] It's a smartphone.
[5329.60 → 5330.22] It looks an awful
[5330.22 → 5331.02] lot like all the
[5331.02 → 5331.42] other smartphones.
[5331.42 → 5332.66] Okay, okay, okay,
[5332.72 → 5334.10] okay, but I would
[5334.10 → 5335.34] go as far as to say
[5335.34 → 5336.74] that this is, okay,
[5336.86 → 5337.52] okay, I mean, some
[5337.52 → 5338.34] of the argument could
[5338.34 → 5339.60] have been before that
[5339.60 → 5340.32] this phone was in
[5340.32 → 5341.26] development before we
[5341.26 → 5342.22] saw that or whatever
[5342.22 → 5342.60] else.
[5342.90 → 5343.42] I hate stuff.
[5343.42 → 5344.34] This thing looks
[5344.34 → 5345.26] like an iPhone 4.
[5345.48 → 5346.42] I hate stuff where
[5346.42 → 5347.76] it's like, the power
[5347.76 → 5348.68] button's on the top,
[5348.98 → 5351.00] patents, like screw
[5351.00 → 5351.44] off.
[5351.50 → 5353.06] Okay, yeah, but not
[5353.06 → 5353.78] only is the lock
[5353.78 → 5354.26] It has rounded
[5354.26 → 5354.68] corners.
[5355.04 → 5355.74] I don't care.
[5355.74 → 5356.76] Not only is the lock
[5356.76 → 5358.24] button on the top, but
[5358.24 → 5359.12] it's on the top in the
[5359.12 → 5359.92] same position.
[5360.80 → 5362.14] There's a tell me it
[5362.14 → 5362.94] doesn't look like an
[5362.94 → 5363.20] iPhone.
[5363.38 → 5363.94] Don't care.
[5364.28 → 5364.90] Tell me it doesn't
[5364.90 → 5365.72] look more, okay, hold
[5365.72 → 5365.80] on.
[5365.80 → 5366.26] Three soft buttons.
[5366.30 → 5366.72] How about this?
[5367.00 → 5367.72] Does it have glass on
[5367.72 → 5368.02] the back?
[5368.08 → 5369.06] We can't see the back.
[5369.06 → 5370.22] Does it look more like an
[5370.22 → 5371.44] iPhone than any other
[5371.44 → 5371.84] smartphone?
[5376.42 → 5377.10] I don't know.
[5377.18 → 5377.70] Probably close.
[5379.02 → 5380.06] What looks more like an
[5380.06 → 5380.74] iPhone than that?
[5381.14 → 5381.30] There.
[5381.70 → 5381.84] Bam.
[5381.84 → 5382.64] It doesn't look that
[5382.64 → 5383.44] close to an iPhone.
[5384.52 → 5384.92] Ooh.
[5385.42 → 5385.96] I don't know.
[5386.20 → 5386.88] Okay, anyway.
[5387.06 → 5388.10] Because it has a circular
[5388.10 → 5389.00] button in the middle, it
[5389.00 → 5389.60] looks like an iPhone.
[5389.88 → 5390.88] And because there's a
[5390.88 → 5391.86] button up there at the
[5391.86 → 5392.12] top.
[5392.52 → 5393.22] Like, people just need to
[5393.22 → 5393.86] get over it.
[5393.86 → 5395.50] You look like an
[5395.50 → 5395.74] iPhone.
[5396.40 → 5396.76] Yes.
[5397.38 → 5398.70] I look close enough like
[5398.70 → 5399.50] an iPhone by their
[5399.50 → 5399.86] definition.
[5400.02 → 5401.32] I have rounded corners.
[5401.56 → 5401.98] Well, whatever.
[5402.04 → 5402.58] They should be able to
[5402.58 → 5402.90] sue me.
[5402.96 → 5403.54] It's going to be an
[5403.54 → 5405.16] Android-based device, but
[5405.16 → 5407.42] Facebook is going to, it
[5407.42 → 5408.12] looks like it's going to
[5408.12 → 5409.28] be heavily modified
[5409.28 → 5410.20] Android without a
[5410.20 → 5411.64] complete sort of
[5411.64 → 5412.26] rewrite.
[5412.48 → 5413.52] So it's not going to be
[5413.52 → 5415.20] like just kind of based on
[5415.20 → 5416.00] the same kernel, but
[5416.00 → 5417.08] completely different phone.
[5417.58 → 5419.08] The main feature is going
[5419.08 → 5420.54] to be tighter integration
[5420.54 → 5421.20] with all of your
[5421.20 → 5422.68] Facebook stuff, which
[5422.68 → 5423.74] honestly, I can't
[5423.74 → 5424.50] figure out why anyone
[5424.50 → 5425.08] would want.
[5425.48 → 5427.76] I couldn't care less.
[5427.76 → 5428.92] I haven't used Facebook
[5428.92 → 5430.76] since I got my HTC One.
[5431.56 → 5432.88] And since I replaced
[5432.88 → 5433.90] everything I do on
[5433.90 → 5435.18] Facebook with WhatsApp,
[5436.24 → 5440.78] Twitter, email, and
[5440.78 → 5442.28] LinkedIn, quite frankly.
[5442.56 → 5443.76] All of those things do
[5443.76 → 5444.88] everything Facebook does
[5444.88 → 5445.54] and Skype.
[5445.90 → 5446.74] Skype's the last one.
[5446.98 → 5448.04] All of those things take
[5448.04 → 5448.96] everything Facebook does
[5448.96 → 5449.72] and they do it better.
[5450.02 → 5451.50] And, I mean,
[5451.60 → 5452.72] integration is great,
[5452.72 → 5453.60] but what if I don't
[5453.60 → 5454.28] want to?
[5454.80 → 5455.62] What if I don't want
[5455.62 → 5456.72] signing in to Facebook to
[5456.72 → 5457.86] mean anyone with my
[5457.86 → 5459.10] freaking Facebook account
[5459.10 → 5459.80] can message me?
[5460.54 → 5461.26] I mean, it got to the
[5461.26 → 5462.04] point where I had to
[5462.04 → 5463.34] cull my Facebook account
[5463.34 → 5464.00] because I used to just
[5464.00 → 5464.86] kind of add anyone who
[5464.86 → 5465.34] added me.
[5465.68 → 5466.48] Oh, because you filled
[5466.48 → 5466.84] up, right?
[5466.90 → 5468.14] So I had lots of people
[5468.14 → 5469.22] adding me from the
[5469.22 → 5470.16] YouTube videos and stuff
[5470.16 → 5470.58] like that.
[5470.66 → 5471.72] And what I realized is
[5471.72 → 5472.98] Facebook keeps changing
[5472.98 → 5474.16] their privacy settings.
[5474.42 → 5475.20] So bull.
[5475.32 → 5476.08] And they'll like reset
[5476.08 → 5476.82] them when they change
[5476.82 → 5477.34] them and stuff.
[5477.34 → 5479.90] So it's not only like,
[5480.08 → 5481.00] you know, because it's
[5481.00 → 5481.96] not just about me.
[5482.02 → 5482.86] Quite frankly, I don't
[5482.86 → 5483.90] put anything on Facebook.
[5483.90 → 5484.84] I don't put anything on
[5484.84 → 5485.48] Facebook that I don't
[5485.48 → 5486.14] want you guys to know.
[5486.22 → 5487.16] I have way more personal
[5487.16 → 5488.32] stuff on Twitter and
[5488.32 → 5489.54] YouTube than I've ever
[5489.54 → 5490.20] put on Facebook.
[5490.44 → 5491.60] It's not about me.
[5491.90 → 5493.46] It's about like the
[5493.46 → 5495.18] people who have their
[5495.18 → 5496.82] privacy settings to set
[5496.82 → 5497.88] to friends of friends.
[5498.02 → 5499.16] So all of a sudden,
[5499.38 → 5501.46] everyone can see my
[5501.46 → 5502.28] grandma's Facebook.
[5502.28 → 5502.36] Facebook?
[5503.16 → 5504.30] Like, she doesn't know
[5504.30 → 5504.78] any better.
[5504.96 → 5505.64] It's ridiculous.
[5506.24 → 5507.60] So Facebook phone,
[5507.82 → 5509.38] I'm going to sort of
[5509.38 → 5511.76] preemptively say, you
[5511.76 → 5513.00] know, good luck with
[5513.00 → 5513.32] that.
[5515.20 → 5516.72] Firefox is also doing a
[5516.72 → 5518.86] like similar idea where
[5518.86 → 5520.54] it's Android, but then
[5520.54 → 5521.60] it's like Firefox
[5521.60 → 5522.00] Android.
[5522.54 → 5522.90] Seriously?
[5523.16 → 5524.22] And they're doing a...
[5524.22 → 5524.96] This is like Chromebook.
[5525.08 → 5526.38] I don't need my device to
[5526.38 → 5527.14] be taken over by a
[5527.14 → 5527.40] browser.
[5528.04 → 5528.62] I don't...
[5528.62 → 5529.36] I'm not that browser.
[5529.48 → 5529.74] Okay.
[5530.24 → 5531.28] How much of the time on
[5531.28 → 5531.90] your phone do you think
[5531.90 → 5532.98] you actually spend in a
[5532.98 → 5533.22] browser?
[5534.22 → 5534.82] Percentage-wise.
[5535.44 → 5536.32] Not that long, to be
[5536.32 → 5536.50] honest.
[5537.12 → 5537.88] For me, it's less than
[5537.88 → 5538.92] 5% for sure.
[5541.04 → 5541.70] That could be
[5541.70 → 5542.28] accurate, yeah.
[5542.78 → 5543.94] So, I'm sorry, why do
[5543.94 → 5544.46] I need a browser?
[5544.58 → 5545.36] Why do I need a browser
[5545.36 → 5545.60] phone?
[5545.64 → 5546.34] Why do I need a browser
[5546.34 → 5546.66] notebook?
[5547.42 → 5548.44] I don't really care.
[5548.54 → 5549.74] The Firefox one, I know
[5549.74 → 5551.34] they're adding in...
[5551.34 → 5551.72] Uh-oh.
[5551.90 → 5552.50] Are we getting troll
[5552.50 → 5552.74] called?
[5553.02 → 5553.28] Maybe.
[5553.98 → 5554.22] Oh.
[5554.62 → 5554.94] I don't know.
[5554.96 → 5555.46] It's my wife.
[5557.06 → 5557.42] Yes?
[5558.36 → 5558.72] Cats?
[5559.48 → 5560.06] Oh, really?
[5560.44 → 5560.84] Cats.
[5561.90 → 5562.18] Oh.
[5562.88 → 5563.26] Cats.
[5563.38 → 5564.30] Okay, do you need me
[5564.30 → 5564.48] now?
[5565.78 → 5566.14] Cats.
[5567.96 → 5568.32] Okay.
[5569.04 → 5569.40] All right.
[5569.80 → 5570.22] I'm out.
[5573.18 → 5573.98] Not cats.
[5574.26 → 5574.66] Oh.
[5575.06 → 5576.10] Yeah, I have to do the
[5576.10 → 5577.38] documentation and stuff
[5577.38 → 5577.90] for you.
[5577.94 → 5578.78] We'll announce what's
[5578.78 → 5579.64] exciting about that later
[5579.64 → 5579.94] anyway.
[5580.30 → 5581.62] I guess you're on your
[5581.62 → 5582.46] own for the rest of the
[5582.46 → 5582.94] live stream.
[5583.10 → 5584.62] So, guys, the topics that
[5584.62 → 5586.22] are remaining are...
[5586.22 → 5588.22] I'm done ranting about the
[5588.22 → 5589.74] Facebook phone, but I mean,
[5589.84 → 5591.24] one thing that's exciting is
[5591.24 → 5592.82] HTC is going to be Deming it,
[5592.88 → 5594.44] and if it's anywhere near as
[5594.44 → 5595.46] good as the build quality on
[5595.46 → 5596.70] the HTC One, which is by
[5596.70 → 5598.12] far my favourite device that
[5598.12 → 5599.50] I've ever put in my pocket...
[5599.50 → 5600.50] Well, okay, second favourite
[5600.50 → 5601.52] device I've ever had in my
[5601.52 → 5601.78] pocket.
[5605.38 → 5606.10] Who knows?
[5606.20 → 5607.72] It may actually be a solid
[5607.72 → 5608.10] phone.
[5608.50 → 5610.16] So, hey, that might be a
[5610.16 → 5610.48] good thing.
[5610.64 → 5611.02] I'm good.
[5611.02 → 5612.38] Disney...
[5612.38 → 5613.64] Oh, I want to talk about
[5613.64 → 5614.40] Disney shutting down
[5614.40 → 5615.22] LucasArts.
[5615.32 → 5615.90] You have to go.
[5615.96 → 5616.42] I know.
[5616.68 → 5617.20] I got this.
[5617.22 → 5618.26] And the military robot
[5618.26 → 5618.96] jellyfish.
[5619.16 → 5620.16] That I don't get.
[5620.86 → 5621.20] Okay.
[5621.26 → 5622.16] We found this thing on a
[5622.16 → 5623.02] military robot jellyfish.
[5623.18 → 5624.02] I can talk about it a bit,
[5624.12 → 5625.54] but it's a military robot
[5625.54 → 5625.92] jellyfish.
[5625.94 → 5627.04] Well, okay, they want to
[5627.04 → 5627.52] militarize...
[5627.52 → 5628.22] Someone wants to
[5628.22 → 5629.16] militarize it, but it's a
[5629.16 → 5631.12] jellyfish that the intention
[5631.12 → 5631.92] is that...
[5631.92 → 5632.84] Because it swims like a
[5632.84 → 5633.94] jellyfish, it looks like a
[5633.94 → 5635.12] jellyfish to sonar or
[5635.12 → 5635.82] whatever else, and the
[5635.82 → 5637.36] intention is that it would
[5637.36 → 5638.16] be able to...
[5638.16 → 5639.00] Because it uses such an
[5639.00 → 5639.98] efficient mode of
[5639.98 → 5640.44] propulsion,
[5640.44 → 5641.76] it would be able to be
[5641.76 → 5643.48] deployed for long periods
[5643.48 → 5645.08] of time to collect things
[5645.08 → 5646.78] like scientific data or
[5646.78 → 5647.32] spy data.
[5647.80 → 5648.20] Wouldn't...
[5648.20 → 5649.26] Wouldn't they be able to
[5649.26 → 5650.22] be like, that's metal?
[5650.48 → 5651.12] Anyway, it's on the
[5651.12 → 5652.98] register.co.uk,
[5653.34 → 5654.30] Virginia Tech Robot
[5654.30 → 5655.12] Jellyfish, if you check
[5655.12 → 5655.44] that out.
[5655.48 → 5656.52] I'll let Slick deal with
[5656.52 → 5657.28] Disney shutting down
[5657.28 → 5658.72] LucasArts, our news
[5658.72 → 5659.46] items of the week from
[5659.46 → 5660.68] linustechtips.com, and
[5660.68 → 5661.50] our build logs of the
[5661.50 → 5661.64] week.
[5661.74 → 5662.58] So, good night, you guys,
[5662.72 → 5664.66] and Slick, carry on,
[5664.72 → 5664.96] told you.
[5665.08 → 5665.38] Already.
[5665.68 → 5666.80] I'm going to get more
[5666.80 → 5667.48] centred here.
[5667.76 → 5668.86] That pizza looks tasty.
[5669.96 → 5670.26] Ugh.
[5670.72 → 5671.68] Okay, so first thing I'm
[5671.68 → 5672.54] going to jump into is
[5672.54 → 5673.32] LucasArts.
[5673.44 → 5674.44] I don't know how well I'm
[5674.44 → 5675.08] going to be able to get this
[5675.08 → 5675.84] on the screen, but you can
[5675.84 → 5676.78] Google it quite easily.
[5677.22 → 5678.38] Disney has decided to
[5678.38 → 5679.44] shut down the LucasArts
[5679.44 → 5680.20] dev studio.
[5681.20 → 5681.94] For all the people
[5681.94 → 5682.90] possibly screaming out
[5682.90 → 5683.64] there, it's not the
[5683.64 → 5683.94] movies.
[5684.48 → 5685.30] Don't worry about that
[5685.30 → 5685.52] yet.
[5686.90 → 5688.04] It's not Industrial
[5688.04 → 5688.68] Light and Magic.
[5688.90 → 5689.54] Industrial Light and
[5689.54 → 5690.10] Magic's okay.
[5690.50 → 5690.70] Yeah.
[5691.08 → 5692.04] It's just like...
[5692.78 → 5694.12] Oh, I rolled over my
[5694.12 → 5694.48] headphones.
[5694.62 → 5695.18] That's unfortunate.
[5695.18 → 5696.82] It's 1313.
[5697.04 → 5697.86] Star Wars 1313.
[5698.12 → 5699.04] Which is really
[5699.04 → 5699.94] depressing to me because
[5699.94 → 5700.98] I've been following 1313
[5700.98 → 5702.58] for a while and was
[5702.58 → 5704.64] actually, like, quite
[5704.64 → 5705.64] excited for it.
[5705.80 → 5707.00] So, thank you.
[5707.26 → 5708.20] So the fact that
[5708.20 → 5710.02] dev cycle is going to end
[5710.02 → 5710.42] is...
[5711.42 → 5712.32] I don't know.
[5712.58 → 5713.24] Not so good.
[5713.28 → 5713.84] I just unplugged my
[5713.84 → 5714.32] headphones, and I'm
[5714.32 → 5715.04] watching the Twitch stream.
[5715.18 → 5715.96] I have to close that.
[5716.26 → 5717.00] Sorry, Twitch chat.
[5717.20 → 5718.36] I can't bro with you
[5718.36 → 5718.88] while they're talking
[5718.88 → 5719.82] about graphics card
[5719.82 → 5720.32] stuff anymore.
[5720.32 → 5722.38] So, yeah.
[5722.48 → 5723.86] That's kind of crap.
[5723.96 → 5724.56] LucasArts has been
[5724.56 → 5725.12] around forever.
[5725.26 → 5725.70] I've been playing
[5725.70 → 5727.18] LucasArts games since
[5727.18 → 5728.76] I started playing games.
[5729.06 → 5730.86] So, I don't know.
[5731.24 → 5732.20] It's disappointing.
[5732.90 → 5733.68] Kind of sad with
[5733.68 → 5734.42] Disney right now.
[5734.58 → 5735.22] Haven't been super
[5735.22 → 5735.96] stoked on a lot of
[5735.96 → 5736.66] their decisions in the
[5736.66 → 5737.12] last while.
[5737.76 → 5739.22] I was kind of excited
[5739.22 → 5740.18] when they acquired
[5740.18 → 5741.00] LucasArts and
[5741.00 → 5741.54] everything that came
[5741.54 → 5741.86] with it.
[5742.36 → 5743.42] I know George Lucas
[5743.42 → 5744.44] was...
[5744.44 → 5745.40] Well, maybe he knew
[5745.40 → 5746.24] that might be a good
[5746.24 → 5746.92] idea for him.
[5747.26 → 5748.32] Also not that stoked.
[5748.84 → 5749.66] But I was kind of
[5749.66 → 5750.30] excited because I
[5750.30 → 5750.94] knew Disney would
[5750.94 → 5751.50] have the budget
[5751.50 → 5752.38] and I knew Disney
[5752.38 → 5753.46] would try really hard
[5753.46 → 5754.44] and I knew with
[5754.44 → 5755.66] the recent comic book
[5755.66 → 5756.10] movies that were
[5756.10 → 5756.62] coming out that
[5756.62 → 5757.14] Disney was doing
[5757.14 → 5757.82] quite well with
[5757.82 → 5758.08] movies.
[5758.20 → 5758.58] So, I was kind of
[5758.58 → 5759.20] excited for that.
[5760.42 → 5761.30] But really, I...
[5761.30 → 5762.20] When I first found
[5762.20 → 5763.04] the article, I was
[5763.04 → 5763.54] the one that added
[5763.54 → 5764.18] this to the live
[5764.18 → 5764.58] stream list.
[5764.80 → 5765.70] When I first found
[5765.70 → 5766.34] the article for
[5766.34 → 5767.02] LucasArts, I kind
[5767.02 → 5767.78] of just...
[5767.78 → 5769.84] Like, completely
[5769.84 → 5770.62] dazed out for a
[5770.62 → 5771.08] little while and I
[5771.08 → 5772.08] was like, really?
[5772.98 → 5773.64] LucasArts just
[5773.64 → 5774.20] got closed?
[5775.10 → 5775.86] Like, honestly?
[5776.56 → 5777.20] I don't know.
[5777.36 → 5777.86] I don't see how
[5777.86 → 5778.26] that was a good
[5778.26 → 5778.52] idea.
[5778.92 → 5780.10] 1313 has so much
[5780.10 → 5781.42] positive hype.
[5782.06 → 5782.76] Like, a lot of
[5782.76 → 5783.52] Star Wars games
[5783.52 → 5784.46] don't necessarily get
[5784.46 → 5785.64] that much positive
[5785.64 → 5786.74] hype, but 1313
[5786.74 → 5787.54] looked amazing.
[5789.30 → 5790.16] Games are up for
[5790.16 → 5791.62] grabs, so other
[5791.62 → 5792.46] studios can pick
[5792.46 → 5792.78] them up.
[5792.84 → 5793.64] They are looking for
[5793.64 → 5794.76] outside development,
[5794.96 → 5796.06] but how many times
[5796.06 → 5796.78] does it happen where
[5796.78 → 5797.62] they actually, like,
[5797.68 → 5798.66] cut a project and
[5798.66 → 5799.22] then someone else
[5799.22 → 5800.34] properly picks it up?
[5800.34 → 5801.98] I don't know.
[5801.98 → 5804.06] I don't know.
[5804.42 → 5805.48] Not too stoked on that
[5805.48 → 5805.68] one.
[5805.88 → 5806.52] Let me check out for
[5806.52 → 5806.96] other things.
[5807.24 → 5807.72] Okay, so this
[5807.72 → 5808.92] military robot jellyfish.
[5809.84 → 5811.06] Again, I think what
[5811.06 → 5811.94] I'll do is here, I'm
[5811.94 → 5813.12] going to start pasting
[5813.12 → 5814.28] these links to my
[5814.28 → 5815.94] mod team, and then
[5815.94 → 5817.22] hopefully my mod team
[5817.22 → 5818.10] can then distribute
[5818.10 → 5819.56] them to the rest of
[5819.56 → 5819.70] you.
[5819.78 → 5820.80] So I just pasted them
[5820.80 → 5822.00] the LucasArts link
[5822.00 → 5822.94] that I have, so you
[5822.94 → 5823.50] guys should get that
[5823.50 → 5823.88] soon.
[5824.72 → 5825.22] And then I'm
[5825.22 → 5825.64] going to, because I
[5825.64 → 5826.08] had to close the
[5826.08 → 5826.76] stream or else it
[5826.76 → 5827.30] would make noise on
[5827.30 → 5827.70] my laptop.
[5828.22 → 5828.84] I'm going to paste
[5828.84 → 5829.54] them now, the
[5829.54 → 5831.22] robot jellyfish link.
[5831.36 → 5832.10] Quite a few different
[5832.10 → 5833.50] news websites have
[5833.50 → 5834.26] the robot jellyfish
[5834.26 → 5835.20] thing, so I wouldn't
[5835.20 → 5835.80] worry too much about
[5835.80 → 5835.90] it.
[5835.96 → 5836.44] You can probably just
[5836.44 → 5836.76] Google it.
[5836.92 → 5839.42] But basically, it's
[5839.42 → 5841.62] eight mechanical arms
[5841.62 → 5842.80] that just kind of
[5842.80 → 5844.98] and the jellyfish has a
[5844.98 → 5845.88] gigantic silicone
[5845.88 → 5847.04] sheet on top of it,
[5847.16 → 5847.96] and it just kind of
[5847.96 → 5848.38] floats around.
[5850.12 → 5850.98] I don't know why
[5850.98 → 5852.12] Linus was that
[5852.12 → 5852.94] interested in this.
[5852.94 → 5854.22] it's a robot that
[5854.22 → 5854.76] just kind of goes
[5854.76 → 5855.56] like this in water
[5855.56 → 5856.28] and has a silicone
[5856.28 → 5856.98] sheet on top of it.
[5857.06 → 5858.00] It weighs like 175
[5858.00 → 5859.34] pounds and has tons
[5859.34 → 5859.78] of metal.
[5860.48 → 5862.12] So I don't think
[5862.12 → 5862.72] this would be that
[5862.72 → 5863.48] hard to detect
[5863.48 → 5864.04] underwater.
[5864.22 → 5865.64] But I guess its
[5865.64 → 5867.10] more immediate plan
[5867.10 → 5867.72] would be to help
[5867.72 → 5868.34] with North Korea.
[5869.42 → 5870.34] So North Korea
[5870.34 → 5871.06] probably can't see it
[5871.06 → 5871.76] underwater because
[5871.76 → 5872.56] North Korea, as far
[5872.56 → 5873.16] as I know, still
[5873.16 → 5875.26] runs like P2s.
[5875.74 → 5877.42] So that's not that
[5877.42 → 5878.12] interesting, I guess.
[5879.14 → 5879.90] What else do we
[5879.90 → 5880.64] have here?
[5880.64 → 5881.64] There.
[5883.42 → 5884.30] Scroll down.
[5884.56 → 5885.26] Unreal 4 engine
[5885.26 → 5887.00] comparison, PS4 and
[5887.00 → 5887.50] PC.
[5887.74 → 5888.20] I'm going to paste
[5888.20 → 5888.88] this one to my
[5888.88 → 5889.74] mods as well.
[5890.46 → 5891.08] Hopefully they can
[5891.08 → 5891.72] throw that up.
[5891.76 → 5892.10] Oh, I've been
[5892.10 → 5892.58] throwing in the
[5892.58 → 5893.76] wrong chat.
[5894.04 → 5895.92] Where's my...
[5895.92 → 5896.70] Here we go.
[5897.94 → 5898.54] There you go.
[5898.96 → 5899.46] Pasted in the
[5899.46 → 5900.48] actual correct chat.
[5900.84 → 5901.44] Sorry about that,
[5901.50 → 5901.66] guys.
[5901.66 → 5905.24] Okay, so this video
[5905.24 → 5907.70] shows PS4 and PC for
[5907.70 → 5908.86] Unreal 4 engine.
[5909.86 → 5910.80] It's pretty cool.
[5911.32 → 5912.52] They're pretty close.
[5913.52 → 5915.06] Which is like I'm
[5915.06 → 5916.22] always on the PC side.
[5916.44 → 5917.56] So that might sound a
[5917.56 → 5918.14] little bit weird coming
[5918.14 → 5919.02] from me, but they are
[5919.02 → 5920.14] actually pretty close.
[5920.14 → 5923.20] I can definitely tell
[5923.20 → 5923.94] that the PC one's
[5923.94 → 5925.52] nicer, but for a
[5925.52 → 5926.66] console, I'm pretty
[5926.66 → 5927.10] impressed.
[5927.26 → 5927.84] So that's kind of
[5927.84 → 5928.50] cool because it's
[5928.50 → 5928.98] kind of...
[5928.98 → 5930.20] It's nice to see that
[5930.20 → 5931.20] consoles are able to
[5931.20 → 5932.64] do this stuff because
[5932.64 → 5933.78] then as people are
[5933.78 → 5934.82] developing for consoles
[5934.82 → 5936.22] and PC, we will see
[5936.22 → 5937.34] even better stuff on
[5937.34 → 5937.62] PC.
[5937.98 → 5939.26] So it's good to see the
[5939.26 → 5940.16] consoles do well
[5940.16 → 5942.22] because that means we
[5942.22 → 5943.40] will also do much
[5943.40 → 5943.66] better.
[5944.14 → 5946.04] So I'm not worried
[5946.04 → 5946.88] about PC in this
[5946.88 → 5947.24] aspect.
[5947.46 → 5948.34] It's an engine that
[5948.34 → 5949.08] they made for both.
[5949.46 → 5950.72] It's obviously going to
[5950.72 → 5951.40] look perfect on the
[5951.40 → 5952.48] other one as well, but
[5952.48 → 5953.14] it looks great.
[5953.26 → 5954.24] PC looks better,
[5954.36 → 5954.68] obviously.
[5954.92 → 5955.96] I just expected a
[5955.96 → 5956.66] little bit more scale
[5956.66 → 5957.28] than was actually
[5957.28 → 5957.52] there.
[5959.38 → 5960.80] Hybrid memory cube.
[5961.22 → 5962.52] This was...
[5963.80 → 5967.10] Oh, wait one second.
[5967.24 → 5967.88] I'm actually not going
[5967.88 → 5969.02] to do hybrid memory cube
[5969.02 → 5969.50] right away.
[5969.92 → 5971.60] These are news items
[5971.60 → 5972.26] of the week, by the
[5972.26 → 5972.40] way.
[5972.48 → 5973.18] Sorry, I jumped into
[5973.18 → 5974.12] Unreal Engine 4 without
[5974.12 → 5974.94] actually saying that it
[5974.94 → 5975.60] was news item of the
[5975.60 → 5975.74] week.
[5975.98 → 5977.04] These are news items of
[5977.04 → 5978.04] the week, so the
[5978.04 → 5978.52] links are going to
[5978.52 → 5979.12] bring you to Linus
[5979.12 → 5980.18] Tech Tips Forum, and
[5980.18 → 5980.76] then you can launch
[5980.76 → 5981.88] from there with the
[5981.88 → 5982.60] links that the people
[5982.60 → 5983.36] that posted these
[5983.36 → 5985.06] things have to the
[5985.06 → 5986.76] actual original post.
[5987.40 → 5988.56] So the next thing
[5988.56 → 5988.96] we're going to talk
[5988.96 → 5990.08] about is a wind force
[5990.08 → 5990.94] cooled Titan.
[5992.12 → 5993.00] So this is
[5993.00 → 5993.96] interesting.
[5995.26 → 5997.96] Personally, I like the
[5997.96 → 5998.58] stock cooler.
[5999.20 → 5999.98] I really do.
[6000.10 → 6001.04] I don't like that many
[6001.04 → 6001.60] stock coolers.
[6001.66 → 6002.96] Do I have it within
[6002.96 → 6004.44] grabbable range?
[6004.44 → 6012.22] wingspan.
[6012.22 → 6013.38] There we go.
[6013.64 → 6013.82] Okay.
[6016.30 → 6016.62] Titan.
[6017.18 → 6018.40] It looks awesome.
[6019.20 → 6020.06] There's a little window
[6020.06 → 6020.80] where you can see your
[6020.80 → 6021.28] heat sink.
[6021.38 → 6022.60] The fan looks great.
[6022.70 → 6023.58] There are tons of metal.
[6023.72 → 6024.74] It weighs a perfect
[6024.74 → 6025.12] amount.
[6025.56 → 6026.64] It just looks really
[6026.64 → 6026.84] good.
[6026.92 → 6027.88] It says Titan on there.
[6027.88 → 6029.98] This GeForce GTX at the
[6029.98 → 6031.78] top glows, and you can
[6031.78 → 6033.90] control this through
[6033.90 → 6035.36] software and make it
[6035.36 → 6037.44] either pulse or be
[6037.44 → 6039.38] solid or go with how
[6039.38 → 6040.44] fast the graphics card
[6040.44 → 6041.42] is calculating things.
[6041.84 → 6043.10] So the stock cooler is
[6043.10 → 6043.68] awesome.
[6045.28 → 6046.20] And the wind force
[6046.20 → 6047.20] cooler looks really
[6047.20 → 6048.10] beefy, so you might be
[6048.10 → 6048.50] able to get better
[6048.50 → 6049.28] performance out of it.
[6049.38 → 6050.28] So there's that.
[6050.70 → 6051.68] But personally, if I'm
[6051.68 → 6052.56] going for a build that's
[6052.56 → 6055.16] all about looks, and by
[6055.16 → 6056.08] the time you have a Titan,
[6056.08 → 6058.50] honestly, personally,
[6058.68 → 6059.64] this thing would crush
[6059.64 → 6061.58] pretty much everything
[6061.58 → 6062.02] I do.
[6062.40 → 6063.40] So I wouldn't be way
[6063.40 → 6064.10] too worried about
[6064.10 → 6065.26] overclocking it a ton.
[6065.50 → 6066.76] I can tell you already
[6066.76 → 6067.86] because of my benchmark
[6067.86 → 6069.08] numbers with this
[6069.08 → 6069.50] cooler on it.
[6069.50 → 6070.38] This cooler is quite
[6070.38 → 6071.30] beefy already.
[6071.98 → 6073.58] It overclocks quite
[6073.58 → 6075.12] well, so I'm not that
[6075.12 → 6075.72] worried about that.
[6076.28 → 6076.90] Like, you might be able
[6076.90 → 6077.44] to squeeze out a bit
[6077.44 → 6078.18] more with the wind force,
[6078.52 → 6079.98] but personally, I
[6079.98 → 6080.84] really, really like the
[6080.84 → 6081.32] look of the stock
[6081.32 → 6082.10] cooler, so I don't know.
[6082.78 → 6083.76] But it's interesting.
[6084.04 → 6084.46] Check it out.
[6085.14 → 6085.82] Pretty cool article.
[6087.08 → 6088.72] The next news item
[6088.72 → 6090.32] of the week is the
[6090.32 → 6091.80] Hybrid Memory Cube.
[6094.80 → 6095.74] Hybrid Memory Cube.
[6095.84 → 6096.76] I haven't read enough
[6096.76 → 6097.30] into this.
[6097.60 → 6098.54] I grabbed this one
[6098.54 → 6098.98] from the forum
[6098.98 → 6099.58] actually today.
[6099.70 → 6100.28] I think it's been up
[6100.28 → 6100.88] there longer than that,
[6100.92 → 6101.56] but I grabbed it just
[6101.56 → 6102.64] today while we were
[6102.64 → 6103.94] working on NCI stuff
[6103.94 → 6105.30] because we only do
[6105.30 → 6106.10] that one day a week.
[6106.74 → 6107.70] So I haven't really
[6107.70 → 6108.30] been able to read it
[6108.30 → 6108.70] that much.
[6109.14 → 6110.72] But the bidirectional
[6110.72 → 6111.74] bandwidth increase is
[6111.74 → 6112.24] insane.
[6112.74 → 6113.88] DDR3 is 11 gigabytes
[6113.88 → 6116.40] per second and the cube
[6116.40 → 6117.42] is 160.
[6118.54 → 6119.48] Holy crap!
[6120.64 → 6121.90] Okay, again, I haven't
[6121.90 → 6122.64] read into this enough,
[6122.96 → 6123.90] so sorry if I'm wrong,
[6124.24 → 6125.60] but if it's, like,
[6125.68 → 6126.48] pre-soldered onto the
[6126.48 → 6127.22] board, I'm going to be
[6127.22 → 6127.70] pretty sad.
[6128.56 → 6129.20] I'm just going to come
[6129.20 → 6129.80] right out and say that.
[6129.86 → 6131.88] That will not be that cool.
[6133.48 → 6134.98] I like changing things.
[6135.32 → 6136.70] I like being able to be
[6136.70 → 6137.34] modular with things.
[6137.48 → 6138.58] If this is able to be
[6138.58 → 6139.52] taken off the board
[6139.52 → 6140.42] and replaced really
[6140.42 → 6142.14] simply like DR RAM is
[6142.14 → 6143.56] right now, that's great.
[6143.56 → 6145.38] I don't know how many of
[6145.38 → 6146.04] you guys out there are
[6146.04 → 6146.86] Ani morphs fans.
[6147.76 → 6148.70] This is pretty old.
[6149.44 → 6150.48] But I can't remember the
[6150.48 → 6151.56] guy's name, but he was,
[6151.72 → 6153.30] he was, like, the horse
[6153.30 → 6154.72] guy, the alien with tons
[6154.72 → 6155.16] of fingers.
[6155.72 → 6156.58] Wow, I totally don't
[6156.58 → 6157.08] remember his name.
[6157.68 → 6159.46] But his technology had
[6159.46 → 6160.98] cubes that they would put
[6160.98 → 6161.68] in things that were,
[6161.80 → 6163.42] like, insane data storage.
[6163.96 → 6165.92] So the second I read
[6165.92 → 6166.42] this, I was like,
[6166.72 → 6167.70] yes, futuristic
[6167.70 → 6169.20] technology, cubes that
[6169.20 → 6169.82] store things.
[6170.12 → 6170.90] I'm stoked.
[6171.18 → 6171.70] So I don't know.
[6171.80 → 6172.32] I thought that was kind
[6172.32 → 6173.94] of cool read up on it
[6173.94 → 6174.72] because I can't tell you
[6174.72 → 6175.38] that much about it.
[6175.52 → 6176.18] Sorry about that.
[6177.60 → 6178.62] Build logs of the week.
[6178.70 → 6179.78] So I mentioned earlier
[6179.78 → 6181.78] in the stream that we're
[6181.78 → 6182.68] going to do two different
[6182.68 → 6183.20] build logs.
[6183.54 → 6185.60] So there's the crazy,
[6185.74 → 6186.74] crazy, ridiculous one
[6186.74 → 6188.00] that took, I believe,
[6188.12 → 6189.72] CNC work and just
[6189.72 → 6191.60] generally a ton of
[6191.60 → 6192.64] ridiculous modding.
[6193.16 → 6194.48] That's Project Zoe.
[6194.84 → 6196.12] I just pasted that to
[6196.12 → 6197.00] the mod.
[6197.08 → 6197.68] So hopefully you guys
[6197.68 → 6198.26] can look at it.
[6198.54 → 6200.64] Sorry, again, I'm really
[6200.64 → 6201.90] not very familiar with
[6201.90 → 6203.04] Linus's scene setup
[6203.04 → 6204.22] that he has through
[6204.22 → 6205.78] XSplit over here.
[6206.04 → 6207.40] So I'm just pasting it
[6207.40 → 6208.36] to my mods and hopefully
[6208.36 → 6209.02] you guys can check it
[6209.02 → 6209.42] on your own.
[6209.66 → 6210.64] Sometimes the stream
[6210.64 → 6212.02] lags out when we view
[6212.02 → 6213.28] pictures in a browser
[6213.28 → 6213.70] anyway.
[6214.02 → 6214.78] So it might even be
[6214.78 → 6215.22] for the better.
[6215.92 → 6217.46] But Project Zoe is just
[6217.46 → 6219.42] kind of fantastic.
[6219.68 → 6221.40] Like, it's a really,
[6221.52 → 6222.26] really, really, really
[6222.26 → 6224.18] nice custom-built PC.
[6224.60 → 6225.32] And a lot of the times
[6225.32 → 6226.42] when you run into this,
[6226.42 → 6230.44] like, they're huge.
[6231.12 → 6232.08] A lot of times these
[6232.08 → 6232.90] custom-built PCs are
[6232.90 → 6233.78] just massive.
[6233.98 → 6234.44] So if you're checking
[6234.44 → 6235.02] out the pictures,
[6235.36 → 6235.90] you're going to notice
[6235.90 → 6237.00] pretty quick it's not
[6237.00 → 6237.64] that big.
[6238.20 → 6239.30] And it's designed for
[6239.30 → 6239.60] landing.
[6239.68 → 6240.32] And he shows pictures
[6240.32 → 6241.36] with himself actually
[6241.36 → 6242.82] at a LAN party with it.
[6242.86 → 6243.64] So it's fascinating
[6243.64 → 6245.10] to see a ridiculously
[6245.10 → 6246.22] high-end machine
[6246.22 → 6248.56] actually get used
[6248.56 → 6252.54] instead of, like,
[6252.60 → 6253.10] some of the machines
[6253.10 → 6253.72] you see out there
[6253.72 → 6254.24] where it's like,
[6254.50 → 6255.18] okay, this machine
[6255.18 → 6256.96] was built, overclocked,
[6257.18 → 6257.96] and then, like,
[6258.20 → 6259.16] locked away where
[6259.16 → 6260.10] no one can ever use it
[6260.10 → 6261.14] because that kind of
[6261.14 → 6261.66] sometimes happens
[6261.66 → 6262.70] or it gets disassembled
[6262.70 → 6263.36] immediately.
[6263.92 → 6264.82] The Ultimate Water
[6264.82 → 6265.34] Cooling Guide
[6265.34 → 6266.24] that we filmed a while
[6266.24 → 6267.16] back but still gets
[6267.16 → 6267.78] tons of views
[6267.78 → 6268.24] so you might be
[6268.24 → 6269.22] fairly familiar with it
[6269.22 → 6270.54] in the TJ-11.
[6271.00 → 6272.08] We built that,
[6272.38 → 6272.80] filmed it,
[6272.86 → 6273.42] and took it apart.
[6275.16 → 6275.90] That's exactly
[6275.90 → 6276.32] what happened.
[6276.48 → 6277.62] So that was a really
[6277.62 → 6278.54] cool build that got
[6278.54 → 6279.92] just torn apart
[6279.92 → 6280.34] right away.
[6280.54 → 6283.26] So it's nice to see
[6283.26 → 6283.80] it in action.
[6284.06 → 6284.80] It's nice to see
[6284.80 → 6285.72] that much attention
[6285.72 → 6286.26] to detail.
[6286.54 → 6287.40] It's nice to see, like,
[6287.56 → 6288.64] all the custom work
[6288.64 → 6289.46] he did was amazing
[6289.46 → 6290.10] and it's just,
[6290.30 → 6290.68] I don't know,
[6290.80 → 6292.06] very, very, very cool build.
[6292.28 → 6293.22] Make sure that you
[6293.22 → 6293.76] check that out.
[6294.14 → 6294.60] I just heard from
[6294.60 → 6295.16] one of my mods
[6295.16 → 6298.18] that the forums
[6298.18 → 6298.60] are getting
[6298.60 → 6299.72] completely overloaded
[6299.72 → 6300.64] so maybe check
[6300.64 → 6301.38] that out later.
[6302.72 → 6303.24] I don't know.
[6303.40 → 6304.16] That might be a good idea
[6304.16 → 6306.00] but you have the link.
[6306.22 → 6306.70] Save the link.
[6306.82 → 6307.32] Bookmark it.
[6307.40 → 6307.64] Something.
[6307.84 → 6308.38] Check it out later.
[6308.76 → 6309.20] I'm going to post
[6309.20 → 6309.82] another link
[6309.82 → 6310.74] so hopefully the forum
[6310.74 → 6311.68] doesn't just completely
[6311.68 → 6312.44] die this time.
[6312.44 → 6313.92] but this
[6313.92 → 6315.54] was called
[6315.54 → 6316.92] Cheap Test Bench.
[6318.26 → 6319.38] Maybe not as cool
[6319.38 → 6320.30] as Project Zoe
[6320.30 → 6322.18] but Cheap Test Bench.
[6322.50 → 6323.94] It's a custom-built
[6323.94 → 6324.48] test bench
[6324.48 → 6325.02] that the guy made
[6325.02 → 6325.80] for four bucks
[6325.80 → 6326.46] and random things
[6326.46 → 6326.88] that was laying
[6326.88 → 6327.42] around his house.
[6327.76 → 6328.80] So we have test benches
[6328.80 → 6329.64] all over the place
[6329.64 → 6330.82] and people often ask us
[6330.82 → 6331.74] where we get them from.
[6331.90 → 6332.16] Honestly,
[6332.26 → 6332.74] can't remember the name
[6332.74 → 6333.38] of the website right now
[6333.38 → 6334.24] but they're fantastic
[6334.24 → 6335.72] and fantastically expensive.
[6336.52 → 6337.46] For what they are,
[6337.56 → 6338.56] they're really expensive.
[6338.74 → 6339.38] We got them sponsored
[6339.38 → 6340.10] from NCI-X
[6340.10 → 6341.34] quite a while ago
[6341.34 → 6344.66] so that was nice
[6344.66 → 6345.54] because we didn't pay
[6345.54 → 6345.84] for them
[6345.84 → 6347.62] but they're awesome
[6347.62 → 6348.04] and expensive
[6348.04 → 6348.80] and he makes his own
[6348.80 → 6349.60] for four bucks
[6349.60 → 6350.34] and it's like
[6350.34 → 6351.42] pretty much the same thing.
[6351.90 → 6352.30] Realistically,
[6352.48 → 6353.42] what we use on here
[6353.42 → 6354.64] is just the two platforms.
[6355.12 → 6355.96] Some of them will have
[6355.96 → 6356.16] like,
[6356.72 → 6357.08] I don't know
[6357.08 → 6357.98] if you can really see this.
[6358.56 → 6358.88] No.
[6359.14 → 6360.48] This is too plugged in.
[6361.28 → 6361.46] Actually,
[6361.54 → 6361.92] you know what's good?
[6362.14 → 6362.60] Give me a second.
[6363.08 → 6364.02] I will unplug this
[6364.02 → 6364.72] but basically,
[6364.94 → 6365.84] some of them come
[6365.84 → 6367.96] with additional rails.
[6368.18 → 6368.36] Oh,
[6368.48 → 6368.60] no,
[6368.64 → 6369.72] the computer's actually on.
[6370.66 → 6371.60] I'm going to leave that
[6371.60 → 6372.78] because it might be
[6372.78 → 6373.38] running something.
[6373.70 → 6374.76] There are additional rails
[6374.76 → 6375.28] on the bottom
[6375.28 → 6375.80] where you can put
[6375.80 → 6376.94] sometimes like optical drives
[6376.94 → 6377.46] or hard drives
[6377.46 → 6377.98] or SSDs
[6377.98 → 6378.30] or whatever.
[6378.62 → 6379.42] We don't actually use
[6379.42 → 6380.00] any of that
[6380.00 → 6380.82] because our test benches
[6380.82 → 6382.16] have to be so modular
[6382.16 → 6384.88] that we just,
[6385.14 → 6385.96] it doesn't make any sense.
[6386.02 → 6386.12] Yeah,
[6386.18 → 6386.78] it's running stuff.
[6388.72 → 6389.12] So,
[6389.26 → 6390.28] because we're constantly
[6390.28 → 6391.22] taking out SSDs
[6391.22 → 6392.00] that have different software
[6392.00 → 6392.66] on them or whatever
[6392.66 → 6395.34] so we just let them hang
[6395.34 → 6397.58] because whatever,
[6397.70 → 6398.18] it's an SSD.
[6398.48 → 6399.56] I can flail this around
[6399.56 → 6400.08] and there isn't
[6400.08 → 6400.92] really any problem
[6400.92 → 6402.12] and we don't really run
[6402.12 → 6402.82] hard drives anymore
[6402.82 → 6405.02] because we have
[6405.02 → 6405.72] network storage
[6405.72 → 6407.64] and then software
[6407.64 → 6408.56] that's actually on the SSD
[6408.56 → 6409.30] really doesn't take up
[6409.30 → 6409.80] that much space
[6409.80 → 6410.92] so it's not really
[6410.92 → 6411.30] a big deal.
[6412.16 → 6412.48] So,
[6412.58 → 6412.70] yeah,
[6412.80 → 6413.46] if you just have
[6413.46 → 6414.28] two platforms,
[6414.92 → 6415.98] it's good enough.
[6416.18 → 6416.98] One thing that you might
[6416.98 → 6417.60] want to look into
[6417.60 → 6418.64] which I didn't see
[6418.64 → 6419.26] earlier
[6419.26 → 6420.20] and I can't see it now
[6420.20 → 6420.84] because I honestly
[6420.84 → 6421.38] can't load it
[6421.38 → 6421.84] on our forum
[6421.84 → 6423.16] is a bar
[6423.16 → 6424.72] for mounting cards.
[6425.94 → 6426.68] That might be
[6426.68 → 6427.24] a little bit more
[6427.24 → 6427.90] difficult to make
[6427.90 → 6428.64] but doable.
[6429.16 → 6430.04] If he just sets up
[6430.04 → 6430.80] a bunch of cards
[6430.80 → 6431.02] there,
[6431.10 → 6431.74] he can just drill
[6431.74 → 6432.38] through the hole
[6432.38 → 6433.20] that's already in the card
[6433.20 → 6434.12] and make a perfect lineup.
[6435.22 → 6436.26] Just take a tiny bit
[6436.26 → 6436.70] more wood
[6436.70 → 6437.64] so that shouldn't really
[6437.64 → 6438.38] be that big of a deal.
[6441.28 → 6442.04] I can take
[6442.04 → 6443.18] Twitter questions
[6443.18 → 6444.66] but
[6444.66 → 6446.02] you have to tweet
[6446.02 → 6446.72] at me
[6446.72 → 6448.46] so
[6448.46 → 6449.26] add slick PC
[6449.26 → 6451.14] this one.
[6451.72 → 6452.18] If you tweet
[6452.18 → 6452.48] at me
[6452.48 → 6452.96] I will try
[6452.96 → 6453.22] and take
[6453.22 → 6453.90] your Twitter
[6453.90 → 6454.32] questions.
[6455.28 → 6455.58] I know
[6455.58 → 6455.92] that's
[6455.92 → 6456.54] a little bit
[6456.54 → 6456.76] weird
[6456.76 → 6457.28] because we
[6457.28 → 6457.82] normally tweet
[6457.82 → 6458.30] at Linus
[6458.30 → 6459.22] but
[6459.22 → 6461.18] not much
[6461.18 → 6461.50] I can do
[6461.50 → 6462.00] about that.
[6462.86 → 6463.18] So yeah,
[6463.36 → 6463.68] tweet at me
[6463.68 → 6463.94] if you have
[6463.94 → 6465.12] any questions.
[6465.60 → 6465.96] See someone
[6465.96 → 6466.58] saying talk
[6466.58 → 6467.36] about LucasArts.
[6467.46 → 6467.86] I think that
[6467.86 → 6468.34] was probably
[6468.34 → 6468.86] from a while
[6468.86 → 6469.14] ago.
[6469.94 → 6470.52] That's really
[6470.52 → 6470.92] depressing.
[6472.92 → 6473.36] One thing
[6473.36 → 6473.94] to talk about
[6473.94 → 6474.66] Bastion,
[6474.78 → 6475.14] the creators
[6475.14 → 6475.78] of Bastion,
[6475.78 → 6477.06] oh my goodness
[6477.06 → 6477.38] that's like
[6477.38 → 6477.62] one of my
[6477.62 → 6477.80] favourite,
[6478.06 → 6479.34] not Little
[6479.34 → 6479.66] Giant,
[6480.14 → 6480.64] one second.
[6480.90 → 6481.20] The creators
[6481.20 → 6481.74] of Bastion
[6481.74 → 6482.32] I can't remember
[6482.32 → 6482.66] their name
[6482.66 → 6482.98] right now
[6482.98 → 6483.40] which is
[6483.40 → 6484.76] kind of shame
[6484.76 → 6486.40] but they're
[6486.40 → 6486.66] coming out
[6486.66 → 6486.96] with a new
[6486.96 → 6487.22] game.
[6487.32 → 6487.78] They're developing
[6487.78 → 6488.32] a new game
[6488.32 → 6488.48] now.
[6488.58 → 6489.36] Supergiant Games
[6489.36 → 6490.10] not Little
[6490.10 → 6490.38] Giant.
[6490.52 → 6490.72] Okay,
[6490.82 → 6491.26] there we go.
[6491.64 → 6492.24] Supergiant Games
[6492.24 → 6492.72] is developing
[6492.72 → 6493.36] a new game.
[6493.82 → 6494.10] Honestly,
[6494.20 → 6494.46] can't remember
[6494.46 → 6494.72] the name
[6494.72 → 6495.00] of it right
[6495.00 → 6495.24] now.
[6495.54 → 6496.06] Looks like
[6496.06 → 6496.78] Transistor
[6496.78 → 6497.42] might be it.
[6497.62 → 6497.94] I'm going to
[6497.94 → 6498.72] post the
[6498.72 → 6499.88] link to their
[6499.88 → 6500.42] page
[6500.42 → 6503.00] right here.
[6503.70 → 6504.02] Bam,
[6504.24 → 6504.88] Supergiant Games
[6504.88 → 6505.38] they're developing
[6505.38 → 6505.94] a new game.
[6506.08 → 6506.62] Bastion was
[6506.62 → 6507.22] amazing.
[6507.42 → 6507.72] If you haven't
[6507.72 → 6508.30] played Bastion
[6508.30 → 6508.60] yet,
[6509.30 → 6510.02] go try it.
[6510.06 → 6510.60] It's awesome.
[6510.72 → 6511.10] It's always
[6511.10 → 6511.78] in Steam sales.
[6512.38 → 6512.94] If you don't
[6512.94 → 6513.32] have it yet
[6513.32 → 6513.70] and it's too
[6513.70 → 6513.92] much,
[6514.00 → 6514.70] just wait
[6514.70 → 6514.96] for the
[6514.96 → 6515.42] summer sale.
[6515.58 → 6515.86] It'll go
[6515.86 → 6516.44] on sale there.
[6517.14 → 6517.82] It gained
[6517.82 → 6518.78] huge popularity
[6518.78 → 6519.42] when it came
[6519.42 → 6520.70] out in a
[6520.70 → 6522.02] Humble Bundle.
[6522.22 → 6522.68] By the way,
[6522.80 → 6523.16] there's Humble
[6523.16 → 6523.60] Bundles going
[6523.60 → 6524.00] on right now.
[6524.28 → 6524.54] Trying to
[6524.54 → 6524.92] think of new
[6524.92 → 6525.58] topics as I
[6525.58 → 6525.74] go.
[6526.30 → 6526.90] One big
[6526.90 → 6527.24] thing,
[6528.22 → 6528.72] you won't
[6528.72 → 6529.06] be able to
[6529.06 → 6529.44] see it right
[6529.44 → 6529.84] now because
[6529.84 → 6530.28] as far as
[6530.28 → 6530.50] I know
[6530.50 → 6530.88] the forums
[6530.88 → 6531.40] are dead.
[6532.32 → 6533.02] That's probably
[6533.02 → 6533.82] because we
[6533.82 → 6534.28] were talking
[6534.28 → 6535.16] about DDoSing
[6535.16 → 6535.96] earlier and
[6535.96 → 6536.48] someone felt
[6536.48 → 6537.20] like flexing,
[6538.20 → 6538.66] which I
[6538.66 → 6539.64] should have
[6539.64 → 6539.96] known was
[6539.96 → 6540.20] coming,
[6540.36 → 6540.74] but whatever.
[6541.16 → 6541.72] That wasn't
[6541.72 → 6542.38] my idea for
[6542.38 → 6542.76] a topic.
[6544.48 → 6545.20] Is that
[6545.20 → 6546.10] Win speed has
[6546.10 → 6546.68] set up a
[6546.68 → 6547.60] thread for
[6547.60 → 6548.08] Build Logs
[6548.08 → 6548.38] of the Week.
[6548.50 → 6548.88] So the two
[6548.88 → 6549.32] guys I just
[6549.32 → 6549.74] talked about
[6549.74 → 6550.22] and everyone
[6550.22 → 6550.56] we have
[6550.56 → 6550.92] previously
[6550.92 → 6551.50] talked about
[6551.50 → 6552.20] will be on
[6552.20 → 6552.60] this thread.
[6552.70 → 6552.98] This thread
[6552.98 → 6553.22] will be
[6553.22 → 6554.16] stickier on
[6554.16 → 6554.82] the top of
[6554.82 → 6555.42] the Build Logs
[6555.42 → 6555.70] section.
[6556.58 → 6557.20] Good idea to
[6557.20 → 6557.54] check it out.
[6557.60 → 6557.88] There's some
[6557.88 → 6558.36] really cool
[6558.36 → 6558.86] builds in there
[6558.86 → 6559.48] and the
[6559.48 → 6560.06] comments of
[6560.06 → 6560.46] those builds
[6560.46 → 6560.86] are awesome
[6560.86 → 6561.14] too.
[6561.46 → 6561.86] People will
[6561.86 → 6562.94] post tons
[6562.94 → 6563.42] of pictures
[6563.42 → 6563.86] normally,
[6564.48 → 6565.12] like tons
[6565.12 → 6565.56] of pictures
[6565.56 → 6566.04] of the
[6566.04 → 6566.74] entirety of
[6566.74 → 6567.20] the progress
[6567.20 → 6567.54] of their
[6567.54 → 6567.78] build,
[6568.10 → 6568.46] which is
[6568.46 → 6568.86] great.
[6569.84 → 6570.44] People will
[6570.44 → 6570.92] comment about
[6570.92 → 6571.14] things,
[6571.22 → 6571.38] people will
[6571.38 → 6571.60] give them
[6571.60 → 6571.98] tips.
[6572.42 → 6573.06] A lot of
[6573.06 → 6573.38] times with
[6573.38 → 6573.64] the ones
[6573.64 → 6573.88] that are in
[6573.88 → 6574.34] the Build Logs
[6574.34 → 6574.62] of the Week
[6574.62 → 6574.96] there isn't
[6574.96 → 6575.38] that many
[6575.38 → 6575.98] tips because
[6575.98 → 6576.30] they made
[6576.30 → 6576.52] it to the
[6576.52 → 6576.84] Build Logs
[6576.84 → 6577.08] of the Week
[6577.08 → 6577.86] for a very,
[6578.18 → 6578.82] very good
[6578.82 → 6579.20] reason.
[6580.36 → 6580.96] But yeah,
[6581.30 → 6581.84] go check
[6581.84 → 6582.34] those out.
[6583.08 → 6583.46] Tell them
[6583.46 → 6583.92] they're awesome
[6583.92 → 6584.42] because they
[6584.42 → 6584.98] deserve it.
[6585.08 → 6585.38] They made it
[6585.38 → 6585.86] to Build Logs
[6585.86 → 6586.16] of the Week
[6586.16 → 6586.80] which is cool.
[6586.96 → 6587.26] Most of them
[6587.26 → 6587.84] have quite a few
[6587.84 → 6588.60] comments but
[6588.60 → 6589.86] every thank you
[6589.86 → 6590.38] matters to
[6590.38 → 6590.76] these guys.
[6591.80 → 6592.54] I used to
[6592.54 → 6593.02] try and get
[6593.02 → 6594.40] OCN's build
[6594.40 → 6595.14] of the whatever.
[6595.36 → 6595.74] I don't remember
[6595.74 → 6596.26] what theirs is
[6596.26 → 6597.14] based on but
[6597.14 → 6597.90] I never actually
[6597.90 → 6598.30] got it.
[6598.62 → 6599.38] I didn't actually
[6599.38 → 6599.84] deserve it.
[6600.10 → 6600.58] I tried with
[6600.58 → 6601.16] my Mineral Oil
[6601.16 → 6601.46] PC.
[6602.74 → 6603.42] You won't be
[6603.42 → 6603.82] able to find
[6603.82 → 6604.18] this thread.
[6604.26 → 6604.70] You can try
[6604.70 → 6605.04] but you won't
[6605.04 → 6605.28] be able to
[6605.28 → 6605.68] find this thread.
[6605.94 → 6606.76] It is on OCN.
[6606.86 → 6607.68] My Build Log
[6607.68 → 6608.36] for my Mineral Oil
[6608.36 → 6609.40] PC was on OCN
[6609.40 → 6609.96] at one point in
[6609.96 → 6610.18] time.
[6610.58 → 6611.34] I think I pulled
[6611.34 → 6612.04] it down now.
[6612.56 → 6613.00] But you can
[6613.00 → 6613.42] check out the
[6613.42 → 6613.84] video.
[6614.56 → 6615.22] That I'm not
[6615.22 → 6615.50] going to be able
[6615.50 → 6615.92] to get a link
[6615.92 → 6616.70] for but Mod
[6616.70 → 6617.18] Team if you're
[6617.18 → 6617.90] listening try and
[6617.90 → 6618.44] get that video
[6618.44 → 6618.86] and link it
[6618.86 → 6619.28] in the Twitch
[6619.28 → 6619.64] comments.
[6619.76 → 6620.02] That would be
[6620.02 → 6620.32] great.
[6622.24 → 6622.96] That PC
[6622.96 → 6624.10] shouldn't have
[6624.10 → 6624.32] won.
[6624.90 → 6625.50] The guy that I
[6625.50 → 6625.96] was up against
[6625.96 → 6627.40] was way
[6627.40 → 6628.10] legitimately better
[6628.10 → 6628.42] than mine.
[6629.10 → 6629.72] That was my
[6629.72 → 6630.32] first time ever
[6630.32 → 6630.96] experimenting with
[6630.96 → 6631.48] something like a
[6631.48 → 6632.14] Mineral Oil PC.
[6632.82 → 6633.50] Honestly if I had
[6633.50 → 6634.74] a bigger tank I
[6634.74 → 6635.40] ran out of budget
[6635.40 → 6636.92] which sucked.
[6637.04 → 6637.60] And honestly if I
[6637.60 → 6638.18] had the budget I
[6638.18 → 6638.66] still don't know if
[6638.66 → 6639.04] I would have beat
[6639.04 → 6639.64] the guy that won.
[6640.20 → 6641.32] He was kind of
[6641.32 → 6642.30] awesome in the
[6642.30 → 6642.92] running that I was
[6642.92 → 6643.10] in.
[6644.16 → 6644.70] And I never
[6644.70 → 6645.50] reposted it because
[6645.50 → 6645.96] I lost.
[6646.16 → 6646.48] So I was like
[6646.48 → 6647.04] whatever I'm not
[6647.04 → 6647.48] going to be a sore
[6647.48 → 6648.00] loser and just
[6648.00 → 6648.66] keep reposting
[6648.66 → 6649.34] until I hopefully
[6649.34 → 6649.66] win.
[6649.80 → 6650.28] But whatever.
[6651.46 → 6652.30] If I had a bigger
[6652.30 → 6653.20] tank I would have
[6653.20 → 6653.94] been able to
[6653.94 → 6654.58] cable route
[6654.58 → 6655.06] properly.
[6655.46 → 6656.12] If you watch the
[6656.12 → 6656.76] video my cables
[6656.76 → 6657.18] are just like
[6657.18 → 6657.64] meh.
[6657.88 → 6658.70] I had no space
[6658.70 → 6659.04] behind my
[6659.04 → 6659.40] motherboard.
[6659.58 → 6660.08] My tank was
[6660.08 → 6660.76] not big enough.
[6661.36 → 6661.94] One thing you'll
[6661.94 → 6662.52] notice is the
[6662.52 → 6663.36] power supply housing
[6663.36 → 6663.88] has been ripped
[6663.88 → 6664.70] off entirely.
[6665.88 → 6666.58] That was actually
[6666.58 → 6667.30] physically ripped
[6667.30 → 6667.58] off.
[6667.64 → 6668.30] I had no cutters
[6668.30 → 6668.98] which was really
[6668.98 → 6669.40] unfortunate.
[6670.10 → 6670.90] I had to tear
[6670.90 → 6671.48] the metal in
[6671.48 → 6671.68] half.
[6671.84 → 6672.64] That was my
[6672.64 → 6673.96] hands hurt for
[6673.96 → 6674.56] like a long
[6674.56 → 6674.86] time.
[6674.86 → 6678.84] Yeah I had to
[6678.84 → 6679.42] rip the metal
[6679.42 → 6679.78] off the power
[6679.78 → 6680.24] supply because
[6680.24 → 6681.08] if you see how
[6681.08 → 6681.44] it goes down
[6681.44 → 6682.06] the ram is
[6682.06 → 6683.32] horizontally right
[6683.32 → 6683.96] above the power
[6683.96 → 6684.22] supply.
[6684.86 → 6685.12] And what
[6685.12 → 6685.82] happened was the
[6685.82 → 6686.84] casing was going
[6686.84 → 6687.30] to push the
[6687.30 → 6687.78] ram up.
[6688.90 → 6689.58] Because I did
[6689.58 → 6690.40] most my
[6690.40 → 6691.72] I did all of
[6691.72 → 6692.88] my CAD
[6692.88 → 6693.94] calculations with
[6693.94 → 6694.72] the fish tank
[6694.72 → 6695.24] and with all my
[6695.24 → 6695.74] parts and everything
[6695.74 → 6696.64] without fish rocks
[6696.64 → 6697.06] in the bottom.
[6697.52 → 6698.00] And I ended up
[6698.00 → 6698.66] putting fish rocks
[6698.66 → 6699.10] in the bottom.
[6699.72 → 6700.62] So what I had to
[6700.62 → 6701.96] do was kind of
[6701.96 → 6702.62] try and sift them
[6702.62 → 6702.90] away.
[6702.90 → 6703.82] But while I
[6703.82 → 6704.44] submerged the
[6704.44 → 6705.56] whole slate of
[6705.56 → 6706.72] everything that
[6706.72 → 6707.70] like the plexiglass
[6707.70 → 6708.44] shield that was in
[6708.44 → 6709.56] it the rocks would
[6709.56 → 6710.14] sift back.
[6710.56 → 6711.38] So at least one
[6711.38 → 6712.04] would get under the
[6712.04 → 6712.56] power supply and
[6712.56 → 6713.18] keep it a little
[6713.18 → 6713.88] bit up which
[6713.88 → 6714.24] means it would
[6714.24 → 6715.08] hit the ram a
[6715.08 → 6715.70] little bit which
[6715.70 → 6716.38] would bend it up
[6716.38 → 6717.40] which is just not
[6717.40 → 6717.86] very cool.
[6718.20 → 6718.70] So I ripped the
[6718.70 → 6719.62] outer housing of
[6719.62 → 6720.12] the power supply
[6720.12 → 6720.66] off and honestly
[6720.66 → 6721.74] it looks kind of
[6721.74 → 6722.02] awesome.
[6722.34 → 6723.50] So that was a
[6723.50 → 6724.44] mistake that ended
[6724.44 → 6725.04] up being quite
[6725.04 → 6725.36] cool.
[6726.10 → 6727.28] Although I really
[6727.28 → 6728.26] really don't
[6728.26 → 6728.84] recommend taking
[6728.84 → 6729.46] your power supply
[6729.46 → 6729.76] apart.
[6730.16 → 6731.34] Especially do not
[6731.34 → 6732.06] mess with what's
[6732.06 → 6732.66] inside there.
[6732.90 → 6733.26] after you take
[6733.26 → 6733.76] your power supply
[6733.76 → 6734.00] apart.
[6734.42 → 6734.92] I've got some
[6734.92 → 6735.66] Twitter interactions
[6735.66 → 6736.08] now.
[6736.76 → 6737.20] Take Bantus'
[6737.32 → 6737.98] laptop and do
[6737.98 → 6739.50] the pro...
[6739.50 → 6739.86] Ooh.
[6741.62 → 6742.44] See okay the
[6742.44 → 6743.76] problem with my
[6743.76 → 6744.44] melter program.
[6744.90 → 6746.56] One I don't want
[6746.56 → 6747.16] to do that prank
[6747.16 → 6747.42] anymore.
[6747.54 → 6748.00] I know I talked
[6748.00 → 6748.48] to the streamer
[6748.48 → 6749.02] about pranking
[6749.02 → 6749.90] him but the
[6749.90 → 6750.56] prank was about
[6750.56 → 6751.18] melting his
[6751.18 → 6751.48] screen.
[6751.98 → 6752.48] Now it's
[6752.48 → 6753.34] software melting.
[6754.08 → 6755.00] So the second I
[6755.00 → 6755.50] have it programmed
[6755.50 → 6757.18] in this program
[6757.18 → 6757.92] is really not that
[6757.92 → 6758.44] hard to make.
[6760.24 → 6761.14] Like honestly it's
[6761.14 → 6761.72] really not that
[6761.72 → 6762.16] hard to make.
[6762.50 → 6763.00] If you just press
[6763.00 → 6764.06] escape it'll close
[6764.06 → 6764.22] it.
[6764.70 → 6765.52] But the program
[6765.52 → 6766.22] all it does is
[6766.22 → 6767.26] just take random
[6767.26 → 6768.22] slice frames of your
[6768.22 → 6768.98] screen and droop
[6768.98 → 6769.50] them at random
[6769.50 → 6769.84] intervals.
[6770.14 → 6771.10] It's honestly not
[6771.10 → 6771.72] that complicated.
[6773.10 → 6774.08] And it just droops it,
[6774.14 → 6774.64] droops it, droops it
[6774.64 → 6775.24] and then if you just
[6775.24 → 6775.82] press escape it
[6775.82 → 6776.10] closes.
[6776.46 → 6777.52] So the idea is that
[6777.52 → 6778.34] it makes your screen
[6778.34 → 6779.34] look like it's
[6779.34 → 6780.24] melting but the
[6780.24 → 6780.78] second you press
[6780.78 → 6781.40] escape it closes
[6781.40 → 6782.48] the program which
[6782.48 → 6784.12] just then shows
[6784.12 → 6784.88] everything properly.
[6785.18 → 6785.50] So it doesn't
[6785.50 → 6786.26] actually do anything
[6786.26 → 6786.66] wrong to your
[6786.66 → 6786.88] screen.
[6786.88 → 6788.02] Now I don't
[6788.02 → 6788.76] want to do this
[6788.76 → 6789.52] because he had
[6789.52 → 6790.28] his awesome,
[6790.68 → 6791.54] awesome monitor
[6791.54 → 6793.14] and his cat jumped
[6793.14 → 6793.98] on top of it and
[6793.98 → 6794.66] it cracked and
[6794.66 → 6795.56] ruined the monitor.
[6796.00 → 6797.10] So if I do that
[6797.10 → 6797.60] to one of his
[6797.60 → 6799.22] devices now that's
[6799.22 → 6800.28] more of a like
[6800.28 → 6802.26] brutal not funny
[6802.26 → 6803.86] blow instead of
[6803.86 → 6804.78] before where it
[6804.78 → 6805.64] was just like ha
[6805.64 → 6806.96] ha it was funny
[6806.96 → 6807.46] you just press
[6807.46 → 6808.02] escape and then
[6808.02 → 6808.74] it was fine no
[6808.74 → 6809.26] big deal.
[6809.64 → 6810.22] Now it's like
[6810.22 → 6812.84] not cool not
[6812.84 → 6813.16] funny.
[6813.74 → 6815.34] Okay so probably
[6815.34 → 6816.12] not doing that.
[6816.12 → 6817.16] I did fix my
[6817.16 → 6817.76] ducky wrist rest
[6817.76 → 6818.10] problem.
[6818.44 → 6818.94] I don't remember
[6818.94 → 6820.20] the solution stuff
[6820.20 → 6820.94] that I sprayed on
[6820.94 → 6821.74] and this is not
[6821.74 → 6822.22] going to narrow it
[6822.22 → 6822.80] down enough but
[6822.80 → 6823.28] one of my friends
[6823.28 → 6823.80] that's perfect
[6823.80 → 6824.94] with cars I
[6824.94 → 6825.96] explained it to
[6825.96 → 6827.00] him he sprayed
[6827.00 → 6827.58] some stuff on the
[6827.58 → 6828.42] bottom and now
[6828.42 → 6829.04] it doesn't slide
[6829.04 → 6829.32] around.
[6829.76 → 6830.84] That was probably
[6830.84 → 6831.74] the least descriptive
[6831.74 → 6832.50] thing I've ever
[6832.50 → 6833.38] said in my entire
[6833.38 → 6835.06] life, but it's
[6835.06 → 6835.72] awesome and it
[6835.72 → 6837.40] works so yeah
[6837.40 → 6838.06] that was fixed.
[6838.14 → 6838.80] My keyboard also
[6838.80 → 6839.68] works perfectly fine
[6839.68 → 6840.34] now if anyone's
[6840.34 → 6840.54] wondering.
[6840.54 → 6845.48] I just got a
[6845.48 → 6846.18] mechanical keyboard
[6846.18 → 6847.24] and now I know
[6847.24 → 6847.74] why you keep
[6847.74 → 6848.28] saying they're so
[6848.28 → 6848.56] good.
[6849.32 → 6849.82] They are.
[6849.90 → 6850.42] They're amazing.
[6850.54 → 6850.82] If you don't have
[6850.82 → 6851.38] a mechanical keyboard
[6851.38 → 6852.22] at least try one
[6852.22 → 6852.60] out you'll be
[6852.60 → 6853.18] sold right away.
[6853.72 → 6854.10] Where do you get
[6854.10 → 6854.88] your keycaps from
[6854.88 → 6855.12] though?
[6855.44 → 6856.54] Some of my keycaps
[6856.54 → 6859.74] my PBT keycaps
[6859.74 → 6860.10] were from
[6860.10 → 6861.28] mechanicalkeyboards.com
[6861.28 → 6862.22] I bought the
[6862.22 → 6862.74] ducky kit.
[6862.84 → 6863.42] I like the ducky
[6863.42 → 6864.08] kit because it
[6864.08 → 6865.42] comes like even if
[6865.42 → 6865.76] you don't have a
[6865.76 → 6866.76] ducky although some
[6866.76 → 6867.90] might not be
[6867.90 → 6868.22] compatible.
[6868.22 → 6869.56] Make sure you do
[6869.56 → 6870.06] your research and
[6870.06 → 6870.80] buy the right kit
[6870.80 → 6871.18] that's fully
[6871.18 → 6871.62] compatible with
[6871.62 → 6872.04] your keyboard.
[6873.90 → 6874.86] The ducky has
[6874.86 → 6875.68] really nice quality
[6875.68 → 6876.74] PBT space bars.
[6877.28 → 6877.92] If you're buying a
[6877.92 → 6881.22] PBT kit imperfections
[6881.22 → 6882.10] are quite common
[6882.10 → 6883.82] so be pretty careful
[6883.82 → 6884.38] when you're actually
[6884.38 → 6885.06] looking into that
[6885.06 → 6886.44] because it's really
[6886.44 → 6887.38] really easy to have
[6887.38 → 6888.04] pretty serious
[6888.04 → 6888.88] problems with your
[6888.88 → 6890.24] space bars and other
[6890.24 → 6891.54] larger keys like
[6891.54 → 6892.42] bumping or rippling
[6892.42 → 6893.70] or whatever or even
[6893.70 → 6894.94] just like drastic
[6894.94 → 6895.64] imperfections.
[6896.08 → 6896.88] Anyway I'm going to
[6896.88 → 6897.30] get off that.
[6897.30 → 6898.76] WAS keys.
[6899.56 → 6902.60] I think AFTER keys.
[6903.16 → 6904.52] Mechanicalkeyboards.com
[6904.52 → 6906.04] There's quite a few
[6906.04 → 6906.62] places to buy
[6906.62 → 6907.08] keycaps.
[6910.64 → 6911.74] Looking through some
[6911.74 → 6912.38] more questions.
[6914.72 → 6915.66] How long have I been
[6915.66 → 6916.10] with Linus?
[6916.16 → 6916.96] I've been with Linus
[6916.96 → 6922.46] since November 2011.
[6923.90 → 6924.52] Is that right?
[6924.52 → 6928.26] Yeah.
[6928.94 → 6930.48] Like November 10th?
[6930.48 → 6931.04] 2011?
[6931.32 → 6931.68] That might be
[6931.68 → 6932.00] accurate.
[6932.96 → 6933.60] What's up?
[6934.24 → 6934.48] Hey.
[6934.74 → 6935.22] I'm joining.
[6935.44 → 6937.12] I went through all
[6937.12 → 6937.98] the topics, so I'm
[6937.98 → 6938.38] just going through
[6938.38 → 6939.00] Twitter right now.
[6939.32 → 6939.90] But I had everyone
[6939.90 → 6940.60] go to my Twitter
[6940.60 → 6941.44] because I can't
[6941.44 → 6942.12] figure out your
[6942.12 → 6943.08] crazy scene things.
[6943.22 → 6943.82] Your Twitter?
[6944.06 → 6944.28] Yeah.
[6944.72 → 6945.08] What?
[6945.32 → 6945.54] Yeah.
[6945.68 → 6946.24] We can go back
[6946.24 → 6946.66] to your Twitter.
[6946.66 → 6947.80] So between Ryan
[6947.80 → 6948.84] pimping his YouTube
[6948.84 → 6949.96] channel on my
[6949.96 → 6951.22] live stream and you
[6951.22 → 6952.14] pimping your Twitter
[6952.14 → 6953.26] on my live stream.
[6953.26 → 6954.44] I have good reason
[6954.44 → 6955.02] to pimp my own
[6955.02 → 6955.26] Twitter.
[6955.66 → 6956.14] That's true.
[6956.20 → 6956.66] You're just like
[6956.66 → 6957.44] whatever I don't
[6957.44 → 6958.04] really care about
[6958.04 → 6958.84] live stream I'm going
[6958.84 → 6959.38] to go do other
[6959.38 → 6960.22] things that matter.
[6960.38 → 6961.44] And your Twitter I
[6961.44 → 6962.38] actually care about
[6962.38 → 6963.70] people following because
[6963.70 → 6964.40] you're awesome.
[6965.06 → 6965.30] Oh.
[6965.30 → 6967.80] Where is the thing?
[6967.96 → 6968.82] I couldn't find it.
[6968.96 → 6969.52] That's how I was
[6969.52 → 6970.38] going to control the
[6970.38 → 6970.70] computer.
[6971.32 → 6971.78] Oh look.
[6972.16 → 6973.08] Oh that's fantastic.
[6973.36 → 6973.68] Oh.
[6974.04 → 6974.24] Oh.
[6974.68 → 6975.12] Oh.
[6975.52 → 6976.18] You hid it.
[6976.40 → 6977.38] I didn't hide it.
[6977.92 → 6978.84] No idea what you're
[6978.84 → 6979.44] talking about.
[6980.06 → 6980.40] Okay.
[6980.72 → 6982.64] So Twitter.
[6983.68 → 6984.62] So basically what
[6984.62 → 6985.38] you do is you take
[6985.38 → 6986.94] Twitter and you tuck
[6986.94 → 6988.38] it over here and then
[6988.38 → 6989.28] you go here and you
[6989.28 → 6989.90] go scene two.
[6990.04 → 6990.30] Bam.
[6991.08 → 6991.60] All right.
[6991.90 → 6992.52] Why do we need
[6992.52 → 6993.34] USB 3?
[6993.82 → 6994.56] What else is this
[6994.56 → 6995.56] technology good for
[6995.56 → 6996.68] other than USB flash
[6996.68 → 6997.52] drives and external
[6997.52 → 6998.24] SSD drives?
[6998.32 → 6998.92] Well external hard
[6998.92 → 6999.56] drives for one thing.
[6999.68 → 7000.48] External anything
[7000.48 → 7001.98] drive storage.
[7002.42 → 7003.48] USB 3 is already
[7003.48 → 7003.96] like.
[7005.64 → 7006.64] It's really.
[7006.90 → 7007.46] Yeah it's awesome.
[7007.60 → 7008.02] It's annoying
[7008.02 → 7008.76] transferring things
[7008.76 → 7009.62] through USB 2 now.
[7009.66 → 7010.48] Yeah I get frustrated.
[7010.90 → 7011.62] Like why is this
[7011.62 → 7012.44] taking so long?
[7012.52 → 7013.24] It can go so much
[7013.24 → 7013.62] faster.
[7013.74 → 7014.52] All my flash drives
[7014.52 → 7015.56] are USB 3 and
[7015.56 → 7016.50] quite frankly I mean
[7016.50 → 7017.38] do we need reasons
[7017.38 → 7018.42] other than that for
[7018.42 → 7018.90] USB 3?
[7019.36 → 7020.26] I mean not only that
[7020.26 → 7021.24] but you can have other
[7021.24 → 7022.30] high throughput devices
[7022.30 → 7023.16] things like capture
[7023.16 → 7024.08] cards can be run off
[7024.08 → 7024.64] USB 3.
[7024.72 → 7025.26] Really, really high
[7025.26 → 7026.12] resolution webcams?
[7026.30 → 7026.46] Yeah.
[7026.66 → 7027.50] Super high resolution.
[7027.50 → 7028.24] Yeah what if we could
[7028.24 → 7029.22] have a 4K webcam?
[7033.70 → 7034.56] Reasons will come.
[7034.84 → 7035.50] Some reasons are
[7035.50 → 7036.00] already here and
[7036.00 → 7036.58] other reasons will
[7036.58 → 7037.18] come as we go.
[7037.66 → 7038.44] Wow look at that.
[7038.58 → 7039.48] All the viewers didn't
[7039.48 → 7040.52] just abandon it when I
[7040.52 → 7040.78] left.
[7041.48 → 7042.24] You did good.
[7042.34 → 7043.14] They don't all hate me.
[7043.30 → 7043.62] It's all right.
[7043.68 → 7044.10] That's true.
[7044.20 → 7044.96] No it's just the one
[7044.96 → 7045.82] guy that hates you.
[7046.24 → 7047.94] Yeah the one dude that
[7047.94 → 7050.36] like really hates
[7050.36 → 7050.72] me.
[7050.78 → 7050.96] Yeah.
[7051.10 → 7052.30] Like whoa.
[7052.48 → 7052.80] It's okay.
[7053.00 → 7054.30] If that one guy is
[7054.30 → 7055.70] watching I am not
[7055.70 → 7057.34] actually firing slick.
[7057.58 → 7059.32] If I have my way a
[7059.32 → 7060.96] year from now he will
[7060.96 → 7062.82] still be live-streaming
[7062.82 → 7063.28] with me.
[7063.40 → 7064.04] So there you go.
[7064.16 → 7064.48] Yay.
[7066.54 → 7066.98] Pounding.
[7067.98 → 7069.10] Someone asks how was
[7069.10 → 7070.24] the booty call Linus?
[7070.80 → 7072.34] Guys if I could do a
[7072.34 → 7073.50] booty call that quickly
[7073.50 → 7076.34] then I wouldn't have the
[7076.34 → 7077.58] reputation that I have.
[7077.58 → 7082.62] Okay you know what?
[7082.68 → 7083.06] What the hey.
[7083.16 → 7084.00] I might as well I might
[7084.00 → 7084.92] as well spill the beans.
[7085.46 → 7085.58] Oh.
[7087.26 → 7088.46] Linus Media Group is
[7088.46 → 7089.06] going to have a new
[7089.06 → 7089.54] headquarters.
[7089.78 → 7090.60] I was signing the
[7090.60 → 7091.02] documents.
[7091.46 → 7092.74] We won't be in a garage.
[7093.14 → 7094.32] We won't be in a garage
[7094.32 → 7094.92] anymore.
[7095.18 → 7096.28] It won't be freezing.
[7096.40 → 7097.58] My toes won't be numb.
[7097.78 → 7098.96] That is what I was
[7098.96 → 7100.46] actually doing just now.
[7100.62 → 7101.98] The realtor showed up so
[7101.98 → 7102.98] there was no such thing
[7102.98 → 7106.04] as you know tell him I'm
[7106.04 → 7106.40] busy.
[7106.84 → 7107.00] Yeah.
[7107.00 → 7108.50] Fish posh.
[7108.92 → 7110.26] So the closing date was
[7110.26 → 7111.64] is midnight tonight so we
[7111.64 → 7112.56] had to get the documents
[7112.56 → 7114.46] signed and initialled and
[7114.46 → 7115.68] dated and all that good
[7115.68 → 7116.04] stuff.
[7116.48 → 7117.92] So we're moving into our
[7117.92 → 7119.70] new headquarters in a
[7119.70 → 7121.20] couple of months which is
[7121.20 → 7123.04] extremely exciting.
[7123.26 → 7124.38] We're going to have more
[7124.38 → 7124.96] space.
[7125.10 → 7127.26] We're going to have better
[7127.26 → 7127.70] sets.
[7127.80 → 7128.32] We're going to be able to
[7128.32 → 7128.92] be a little bit more
[7128.92 → 7130.04] organized because I'm not
[7130.04 → 7131.78] going to be having so much
[7131.78 → 7133.28] overlap between my personal
[7133.28 → 7134.84] life and my personal stuff
[7134.84 → 7136.36] and my work life and my
[7136.36 → 7137.06] work stuff.
[7138.16 → 7140.14] So it's going to be yeah
[7140.14 → 7140.82] it's just going to be good
[7140.82 → 7141.20] for everyone.
[7141.32 → 7142.08] Slick's going to have a
[7142.08 → 7143.68] proper test bench that's not
[7143.68 → 7145.40] just like that it's not
[7145.40 → 7146.60] something that doubles as a
[7146.60 → 7148.92] video filming set and is like
[7148.92 → 7150.92] six feet away from Diesel's
[7150.92 → 7153.16] editing station and then is
[7153.16 → 7155.28] like six feet away from our
[7155.28 → 7156.78] filming set on the other side.
[7156.78 → 7158.78] I can almost physically reach
[7158.78 → 7160.38] like all the different main
[7160.38 → 7161.40] areas of this room.
[7161.66 → 7161.82] Yeah.
[7162.24 → 7164.60] So that's extremely exciting
[7164.60 → 7166.12] and so I thought I'd share
[7166.12 → 7167.00] that with you guys.
[7168.90 → 7171.82] Right we're back on Linus's
[7171.82 → 7173.06] Twitter by the way.
[7173.28 → 7174.72] So tweet Linus.
[7174.82 → 7176.24] Hey Luke I am your father.
[7177.58 → 7178.12] Excellent.
[7179.40 → 7180.64] Everyone thinks I was
[7180.64 → 7181.50] grabbing a quickie.
[7181.82 → 7182.50] Look at this.
[7182.50 → 7186.12] Also I'm way out of shape.
[7186.20 → 7187.10] I'd be way more tired.
[7191.96 → 7192.66] Oh man.
[7192.72 → 7193.48] Can you use Twitter on your
[7193.48 → 7193.70] Facebook?
[7193.70 → 7194.78] You're getting dad arms
[7194.78 → 7195.02] though.
[7195.14 → 7196.30] I am getting dad arms
[7196.30 → 7196.58] though.
[7196.74 → 7198.36] So my one arm is getting
[7198.36 → 7198.58] more.
[7199.42 → 7199.76] Well.
[7199.76 → 7202.00] That's not what I was doing
[7202.00 → 7202.28] either.
[7203.88 → 7205.28] I wasn't sure if that was a
[7205.28 → 7206.60] thing because my dad has
[7206.60 → 7208.16] always had like ridiculously
[7208.16 → 7210.36] bulky arms, and I've just
[7210.36 → 7212.14] been like how is that
[7212.14 → 7213.60] possible, and then you're just
[7213.60 → 7214.66] like yeah.
[7215.10 → 7215.94] I hold a baby.
[7216.14 → 7216.38] Yeah.
[7217.10 → 7218.70] You notice the difference in
[7218.70 → 7219.50] my arms though right?
[7219.50 → 7220.20] It's kind of ridiculous.
[7220.20 → 7220.70] Particularly this one.
[7221.14 → 7223.16] Like not only is it bigger but
[7223.16 → 7224.54] it's also firmer and the
[7224.54 → 7226.88] muscle like ripples just from
[7226.88 → 7228.40] like bobbing a baby.
[7228.40 → 7229.76] It's because it's endless
[7229.76 → 7230.16] reps.
[7230.28 → 7231.56] There's no such thing as oh
[7231.56 → 7232.18] my arm's tired.
[7232.28 → 7232.86] I'm going to stop doing
[7232.86 → 7233.18] reps.
[7233.30 → 7234.44] I'm just going to drop baby
[7234.44 → 7234.70] now.
[7234.84 → 7235.00] Yeah.
[7235.06 → 7236.38] It's like the baby's not
[7236.38 → 7237.02] sleeping yet.
[7237.36 → 7238.38] You keep doing reps.
[7238.52 → 7239.80] Because you would rather
[7239.80 → 7241.18] destroy your arm.
[7241.62 → 7241.86] Yes.
[7242.40 → 7243.90] Than not sleep for the 18th
[7243.90 → 7243.92] time in a row.
[7243.92 → 7245.00] Than listen to that noise.
[7245.44 → 7245.72] Yeah.
[7246.40 → 7246.88] Uh.
[7246.88 → 7247.36] Uh.
[7249.30 → 7249.60] Uh.
[7249.60 → 7250.84] The Facebook phone is the
[7250.84 → 7252.70] HTC first and Facebook is
[7252.70 → 7253.82] developing an Android skin
[7253.82 → 7254.26] around it.
[7254.30 → 7254.48] Okay.
[7254.56 → 7255.22] Well maybe there's some
[7255.22 → 7256.42] more news.
[7257.04 → 7257.38] Uh.
[7257.44 → 7258.88] An iPhone looks more like an
[7258.88 → 7259.88] iPhone than the Facebook
[7259.88 → 7260.30] phone.
[7260.66 → 7261.40] Ha ha.
[7262.12 → 7263.16] Very funny.
[7264.16 → 7265.32] The Z10 doesn't look that
[7265.32 → 7265.96] much like an iPhone.
[7265.96 → 7266.04] Uh.
[7267.00 → 7268.54] Kind of more like iPhone 5 I
[7268.54 → 7268.72] guess.
[7269.06 → 7269.88] They're all so similar.
[7270.50 → 7271.88] This comment is kind of
[7271.88 → 7272.22] interesting.
[7272.58 → 7273.48] It's only the perfect PC
[7273.48 → 7275.10] because consoles in their
[7275.10 → 7276.90] idea when you're developing
[7276.90 → 7277.96] a game it's perfect.
[7278.12 → 7279.16] Because it's one set of
[7279.16 → 7279.52] hardware.
[7280.38 → 7281.64] Later on down the line when
[7281.64 → 7282.72] the PC is so much
[7282.72 → 7283.80] ridiculously faster than
[7283.80 → 7285.04] PS4 which will probably
[7285.04 → 7286.74] happen faster than you
[7286.74 → 7287.50] think considering it's
[7287.50 → 7288.10] already so much
[7288.10 → 7288.82] ridiculously faster.
[7288.94 → 7290.40] But like when the scale
[7290.40 → 7291.30] is even more ridiculous
[7291.30 → 7292.46] like it is right now with
[7292.46 → 7294.10] Xbox 360s and
[7294.10 → 7294.96] PlayStation 3s.
[7295.52 → 7295.90] Um.
[7296.80 → 7297.70] It'll change a bit.
[7297.70 → 7298.90] It'll still be easier for
[7298.90 → 7299.86] them to develop for
[7299.86 → 7300.64] it because it's one
[7300.64 → 7301.82] singular set of hardware
[7301.82 → 7303.62] which is why he's saying
[7303.62 → 7304.70] perfect PC again.
[7305.18 → 7307.74] But PC will always rock.
[7307.88 → 7308.78] True PCs will always
[7308.78 → 7309.08] rock.
[7310.16 → 7311.40] You should sue V-Bulletin
[7311.40 → 7312.34] as if it was that
[7312.34 → 7312.68] simple.
[7313.50 → 7313.74] Yeah.
[7314.44 → 7316.22] Ahmed says I just saw
[7316.22 → 7317.26] Lou from Unbox from
[7317.26 → 7318.34] Inbox Therapy.
[7318.52 → 7319.26] Oh Ahmed.
[7319.40 → 7320.84] It's L-E-W for one
[7320.84 → 7321.58] thing because it's short
[7321.58 → 7322.12] for Lewis.
[7322.58 → 7323.86] And then it's Unbox
[7323.86 → 7325.14] Therapy not Inbox
[7325.14 → 7327.00] Therapy, but it's okay.
[7327.00 → 7327.70] It's an understandable
[7327.70 → 7328.12] mistake.
[7328.64 → 7329.52] I didn't know what to
[7329.52 → 7329.80] say.
[7329.92 → 7330.80] How awkward is it
[7330.80 → 7331.98] when people see you?
[7332.74 → 7333.28] I don't know.
[7333.40 → 7333.94] It's like you've been
[7333.94 → 7334.64] there a couple of times.
[7334.72 → 7335.52] How awkward is it when
[7335.52 → 7336.32] people run into me on
[7336.32 → 7336.66] the street?
[7337.26 → 7337.62] Um.
[7337.78 → 7339.88] It's scaled entirely.
[7340.38 → 7341.40] There's been the times
[7341.40 → 7342.90] where it's like oh um
[7342.90 → 7343.48] hmm.
[7344.38 → 7344.82] Okay.
[7345.28 → 7346.10] And then there's also
[7346.10 → 7346.76] been the times when
[7346.76 → 7347.42] it's like oh that guy
[7347.42 → 7348.30] was genuinely cool.
[7348.74 → 7350.26] So I don't know.
[7350.48 → 7351.66] The first time I think
[7351.66 → 7353.52] it was really
[7353.52 → 7354.36] awkward, but it was
[7354.36 → 7355.10] because of me.
[7355.10 → 7356.82] because I was just in
[7356.82 → 7358.42] a mall and the guy
[7358.42 → 7359.24] was like hey it's
[7359.24 → 7360.18] Linus from NCI
[7360.18 → 7360.66] Tech Tips.
[7360.66 → 7360.78] Oh the first time for
[7360.78 → 7361.20] you ever?
[7361.20 → 7361.74] Yeah the first time for
[7361.74 → 7363.30] me ever was uh
[7363.30 → 7363.86] was a little bit
[7363.86 → 7364.38] awkward because the
[7364.38 → 7364.86] guy was like hey
[7364.86 → 7365.70] it's Linus from NCI
[7365.70 → 7366.06] Tech Tips.
[7366.06 → 7366.54] I'm like.
[7367.56 → 7367.80] No.
[7370.58 → 7371.56] I'm just gonna I'm just
[7371.56 → 7372.24] gonna I'm just going to go
[7372.24 → 7372.52] over here.
[7372.70 → 7373.70] Well no I was genuinely
[7373.70 → 7374.82] weirded out because it
[7374.82 → 7376.02] never happened before.
[7376.38 → 7377.38] When I started Tech Tips
[7377.38 → 7378.32] it was supposed to be like
[7378.32 → 7379.38] me talking about how to
[7379.38 → 7380.02] mount a heat sink.
[7380.10 → 7380.92] It wasn't supposed to be
[7380.92 → 7383.10] like you know a thriving
[7383.10 → 7383.98] YouTube channel with
[7383.98 → 7384.48] hundreds of thousands
[7384.48 → 7385.00] of subscribers.
[7385.10 → 7385.90] It was never the plan.
[7387.20 → 7388.30] You know maybe here I'll
[7388.30 → 7389.12] go through some of the
[7389.12 → 7390.12] some of the funniest ones.
[7390.82 → 7393.14] So um one of the
[7393.14 → 7395.08] the funniest ones for me was
[7395.08 → 7396.34] uh this guy that used to
[7396.34 → 7397.46] work at the McDonald's
[7397.46 → 7399.84] in uh Richmond where I'd
[7399.84 → 7400.94] go there after badminton
[7400.94 → 7402.42] every Thursday night or
[7402.42 → 7403.12] Tuesday whenever I used
[7403.12 → 7403.62] to play badminton
[7403.62 → 7405.10] Wednesday night um and
[7405.10 → 7406.10] I'd get a free iced tea.
[7406.52 → 7407.78] So that is the only time
[7407.78 → 7409.48] that my celebrity status
[7409.48 → 7411.20] my internet famousness
[7411.20 → 7413.26] has uh actually amounted
[7413.26 → 7414.20] to free swag.
[7414.34 → 7414.82] It's going to be cool.
[7414.88 → 7416.02] Outside of computer
[7416.02 → 7417.68] hardware which is like I
[7417.68 → 7418.30] mean I'm generating
[7418.30 → 7419.26] exposure for it so it's
[7419.26 → 7419.98] not quite free.
[7420.42 → 7421.06] I could just
[7421.06 → 7422.56] we directly work for it
[7422.56 → 7422.94] it's not really.
[7423.22 → 7424.22] I could buy it in the
[7424.22 → 7425.06] time like just flipping
[7425.06 → 7426.22] burgers I could buy the
[7426.22 → 7427.04] hardware and the time it
[7427.04 → 7427.90] takes to actually make
[7427.90 → 7428.70] content about it.
[7429.32 → 7430.74] Um so that was that
[7430.74 → 7431.22] was a neat one.
[7431.42 → 7432.70] Probably the weirdest one
[7432.70 → 7434.88] I was at McDonald's with
[7434.88 → 7436.32] the old MIX
[7436.32 → 7436.94] cameraman.
[7437.32 → 7437.80] The cameraman.
[7438.58 → 7440.54] Um and someone turned
[7440.54 → 7442.48] around and went I'd
[7442.48 → 7443.48] recognize that voice
[7443.48 → 7443.84] anywhere.
[7444.84 → 7447.66] And I was like hey.
[7448.22 → 7448.78] Hello.
[7449.12 → 7450.00] Yep it's me.
[7450.00 → 7453.10] So he actually hadn't seen
[7453.10 → 7453.36] me.
[7453.74 → 7455.10] He just recognized my voice
[7455.10 → 7456.12] because of its annoying
[7456.12 → 7458.12] high-pitched timber.
[7458.68 → 7459.60] Honestly though like
[7459.60 → 7461.10] before I joined this
[7461.10 → 7462.32] doing the show if I
[7462.32 → 7463.44] watched them I'd usually
[7463.44 → 7465.04] like go to a different
[7465.04 → 7465.76] tab or something.
[7466.04 → 7466.54] No offence.
[7466.70 → 7467.22] Thanks for that.
[7467.30 → 7467.78] I'm just saying.
[7472.26 → 7473.50] What graphics card would
[7473.50 → 7474.52] you recommend for an Uber
[7474.52 → 7475.42] cheap budget build?
[7476.40 → 7477.60] 7770.
[7478.00 → 7478.40] Yes.
[7480.32 → 7481.78] Um someone keeps asking
[7481.78 → 7483.70] me about like CPU
[7483.70 → 7484.48] architectures.
[7484.56 → 7485.66] Guys I am not an
[7485.66 → 7486.12] engineer.
[7486.50 → 7487.68] Do I think 10 nanometre
[7487.68 → 7488.58] or less architecture
[7488.58 → 7489.86] CPUs are possible?
[7490.08 → 7490.72] I don't know.
[7491.22 → 7492.34] All I can tell you is
[7492.34 → 7493.52] Moore's Law keeps going
[7493.52 → 7494.86] and whenever I talk to
[7494.86 → 7495.86] anyone at Intel they're
[7495.86 → 7497.12] like yep we're going to keep
[7497.12 → 7497.62] doing it.
[7497.84 → 7498.92] So there you go.
[7499.10 → 7500.02] AMD's trying to call it
[7500.02 → 7501.60] that Moore's Law is gonna
[7501.60 → 7503.20] not be true soon.
[7503.54 → 7504.58] Maybe for AMD it isn't.
[7504.58 → 7505.46] I read some random
[7505.46 → 7506.42] post about that.
[7506.42 → 7506.44] Whoa.
[7507.00 → 7507.36] Which.
[7508.52 → 7509.98] That was a serious
[7509.98 → 7510.32] burn.
[7510.60 → 7511.40] I read some random
[7511.40 → 7512.30] post about that
[7512.30 → 7513.80] might not have even
[7513.80 → 7514.68] been a real quote.
[7514.74 → 7515.46] Yeah they just got
[7515.46 → 7516.30] pwned so hard.
[7516.30 → 7516.92] Don't quote me on that
[7516.92 → 7517.08] either.
[7517.18 → 7518.90] That was pretty brutal.
[7520.40 → 7521.26] But okay.
[7521.36 → 7521.84] Thank you, Joe.
[7522.18 → 7522.96] Quantum computing
[7522.96 → 7524.86] minicomputers like
[7524.86 → 7526.40] not now but maybe.
[7526.72 → 7527.40] Yeah at some point.
[7527.52 → 7527.68] Who knows.
[7527.68 → 7528.28] In a really far distant
[7528.28 → 7528.60] future.
[7529.24 → 7530.22] Ask Slick where is
[7530.22 → 7530.54] Walter?
[7530.54 → 7543.88] Will asks, so how will
[7543.88 → 7545.14] the new Linus media group
[7545.14 → 7546.04] change things moving
[7546.04 → 7546.38] forward?
[7546.46 → 7547.16] Well it's not that new
[7547.16 → 7547.50] anymore.
[7547.72 → 7548.46] It's been three months
[7548.46 → 7548.72] now.
[7550.14 → 7551.50] So I mean we're hoping
[7551.50 → 7552.30] to amp up the
[7552.30 → 7553.48] professionalism sort of
[7553.48 → 7554.18] at some point.
[7554.18 → 7559.00] I had to actually
[7559.00 → 7560.06] take a second to be
[7560.06 → 7560.92] like wait what?
[7561.38 → 7561.92] And then I was like
[7561.92 → 7563.10] is this an is it is
[7563.10 → 7563.42] serious?
[7563.70 → 7564.40] Is it jokes?
[7565.44 → 7566.58] But seriously I mean
[7566.58 → 7567.18] the Tech Quickie
[7567.18 → 7568.26] channel will continue
[7568.26 → 7569.62] to provide more
[7569.62 → 7571.06] more professional style
[7571.06 → 7571.68] content.
[7571.88 → 7573.52] Content that
[7573.52 → 7575.64] some vendors are
[7575.64 → 7576.58] actually paying us to
[7576.58 → 7576.84] produce.
[7577.00 → 7577.80] We have a really
[7577.80 → 7579.00] exciting video coming
[7579.00 → 7580.52] out for Seagate about
[7580.52 → 7581.34] their wireless plus
[7581.34 → 7581.66] drive.
[7581.78 → 7583.50] It's kind of like we're
[7583.50 → 7584.50] done now, and it's the
[7584.50 → 7585.58] project's been it's been
[7585.58 → 7587.30] approved so it's going
[7587.30 → 7588.38] to be posted soon but
[7588.38 → 7589.46] we did a day in the
[7589.46 → 7590.22] life of someone who
[7590.22 → 7591.14] owns a wireless plus
[7591.14 → 7591.90] and you know what we
[7591.90 → 7592.82] don't get into the
[7592.82 → 7593.56] nitty-gritty of the
[7593.56 → 7594.42] technical the way that
[7594.42 → 7594.94] we would in an
[7594.94 → 7596.20] unboxing or a review
[7596.20 → 7597.56] on Linus Tech Tips
[7597.56 → 7598.34] which will always be
[7598.34 → 7599.34] the editorial side.
[7600.20 → 7601.92] But we did do kind of
[7601.92 → 7603.18] a fun video where it's
[7603.18 → 7604.20] about three minutes long
[7604.20 → 7605.40] and I play the
[7605.40 → 7605.88] protagonist.
[7606.38 → 7607.82] I'm like a star and
[7607.82 → 7608.60] then he's like the
[7608.60 → 7609.98] creepy stalker on the
[7609.98 → 7610.32] street.
[7611.72 → 7613.40] It's so bad.
[7613.86 → 7614.26] Okay.
[7614.48 → 7615.38] You're so creepy.
[7615.60 → 7616.14] It's its.
[7616.94 → 7618.14] The funny thing is I
[7618.14 → 7619.22] told him to dress like a
[7619.22 → 7620.34] scrub, and he wore all
[7620.34 → 7621.24] his normal clothes.
[7621.32 → 7621.90] No I didn't.
[7621.96 → 7623.02] Yes you did.
[7623.04 → 7623.82] I didn't even put a
[7623.82 → 7624.16] shirt on.
[7624.16 → 7625.14] Diesel and I were
[7625.14 → 7627.20] like yeah he just looks
[7627.20 → 7628.50] the same as every day.
[7628.52 → 7629.46] I didn't even put a
[7629.46 → 7629.94] shirt on.
[7629.96 → 7630.94] Whatever go watch the
[7630.94 → 7632.16] video and tell me you
[7632.16 → 7633.24] actually look any
[7633.24 → 7633.56] different.
[7634.66 → 7636.12] In a few shots you can
[7636.12 → 7636.76] tell it's just an
[7636.76 → 7637.24] undershirt.
[7637.38 → 7638.56] In a few shots.
[7638.68 → 7639.96] In like one of them.
[7639.96 → 7641.20] Your hair looks the
[7641.20 → 7641.58] same.
[7642.08 → 7643.24] Your beard scruffiness
[7643.24 → 7644.60] is not any different
[7644.60 → 7646.46] today than it was that
[7646.46 → 7646.84] day.
[7647.16 → 7648.06] No it was longer then
[7648.06 → 7648.80] because you had me
[7648.80 → 7649.42] grow it up for like a
[7649.42 → 7649.58] week.
[7649.66 → 7650.92] That ratty hoodie that
[7650.92 → 7652.72] you wore you wear all
[7652.72 → 7653.52] the time.
[7653.66 → 7654.02] Yes.
[7654.18 → 7655.32] I love that hoodie.
[7656.02 → 7657.22] It's also the worst one
[7657.22 → 7657.62] that I own.
[7657.82 → 7659.74] You only own one pair of
[7659.74 → 7660.90] pants as far as I can
[7660.90 → 7662.38] tell and that's the one
[7662.38 → 7663.24] you were wearing.
[7663.24 → 7666.90] So anyway we had a lot
[7666.90 → 7667.88] of fun filming it.
[7667.98 → 7668.74] It's going to be really
[7668.74 → 7670.26] entertaining to watch and
[7670.26 → 7671.24] I mean it shows you a
[7671.24 → 7672.12] little bit about these
[7672.12 → 7673.32] wireless expansion drives
[7673.32 → 7674.50] particularly the wireless
[7674.50 → 7675.28] plus from Seagate.
[7679.38 → 7680.34] We were just like talking
[7680.34 → 7680.64] about it.
[7680.66 → 7681.30] It's like yeah he just
[7681.30 → 7681.94] doesn't look any better.
[7682.34 → 7682.54] No.
[7682.94 → 7683.98] I told you that when I was
[7683.98 → 7684.34] leaving though.
[7684.42 → 7684.96] I was like I don't want to
[7684.96 → 7686.56] put on because all my
[7686.56 → 7687.38] worst stuff is what I wear
[7687.38 → 7687.72] all the time.
[7687.80 → 7688.56] Don't worry John.
[7688.62 → 7689.32] We're going to make a cool
[7689.32 → 7689.72] background.
[7690.16 → 7690.56] You know what I'm
[7690.56 → 7691.82] thinking we might do is
[7691.82 → 7692.84] there's a little spot
[7692.84 → 7694.76] that's going to be like
[7694.76 → 7697.32] Slick's benching cave.
[7697.82 → 7698.70] So I was thinking what
[7698.70 → 7699.74] we could do is we could
[7699.74 → 7701.64] set up a table that we
[7701.64 → 7702.50] could put just in front
[7702.50 → 7703.28] of the benching cave and
[7703.28 → 7704.00] then we could sit behind
[7704.00 → 7704.24] it.
[7704.44 → 7705.14] It's a pretty cool
[7705.14 → 7705.48] backdrop.
[7705.66 → 7706.88] Yeah the legit benching
[7706.88 → 7708.12] cave is like a great thing
[7708.12 → 7709.06] to have behind us because
[7709.06 → 7710.44] that's where all the work
[7710.44 → 7711.24] actually happens.
[7711.42 → 7712.28] And we've always kind of
[7712.28 → 7713.48] had it like this is my
[7713.48 → 7714.56] current benching cave.
[7714.68 → 7714.80] Yep.
[7714.94 → 7715.90] So if we just have it in
[7715.90 → 7717.40] my next current benching
[7717.40 → 7717.68] cave.
[7717.72 → 7718.34] Yeah I think that's cool.
[7718.52 → 7718.92] What else?
[7719.18 → 7719.96] So yeah we'll see how it
[7719.96 → 7720.22] goes.
[7721.92 → 7722.82] One more question.
[7722.84 → 7723.80] One thing I want to
[7723.80 → 7724.64] throw in before we do
[7724.64 → 7725.30] one more question.
[7725.46 → 7725.66] Sure.
[7725.80 → 7726.72] Is there's a guy on our
[7726.72 → 7727.06] forum.
[7727.46 → 7728.30] I think he's called the
[7728.30 → 7729.08] Norwegian guy.
[7729.26 → 7730.20] Yeah the Norwegian guy.
[7730.56 → 7731.70] He's been developing a mod
[7731.70 → 7733.40] for Skyrim and I mean
[7733.40 → 7734.22] Borrowing.
[7734.36 → 7734.50] Whoa.
[7734.76 → 7735.38] And he's planning on
[7735.38 → 7736.04] developing mods for
[7736.04 → 7736.88] Oblivion Skyrim soon.
[7736.96 → 7737.76] He posted on there.
[7738.10 → 7739.32] They had a server drop
[7739.32 → 7740.96] through an attic in I
[7740.96 → 7742.94] think 2007 and all their
[7742.94 → 7743.78] hard drives died.
[7743.78 → 7746.02] So they lost all their data
[7746.02 → 7747.22] for their mod, and it's like
[7747.22 → 7748.82] 50 to 80 hours of
[7748.82 → 7750.52] additional gameplay and
[7750.52 → 7751.98] they finally got it like
[7751.98 → 7752.98] enough recovered that
[7752.98 → 7753.72] they're restarting to
[7753.72 → 7754.30] development.
[7754.96 → 7756.22] He posted some they're
[7756.22 → 7757.04] making like their own
[7757.04 → 7757.88] OST for it and
[7757.88 → 7758.22] everything.
[7758.60 → 7759.80] 58 hours gameplay their
[7759.80 → 7761.34] own OST like it's
[7761.34 → 7762.54] amazing, and they lost
[7762.54 → 7763.22] pretty much all of it
[7763.22 → 7764.56] but they got most of it
[7764.56 → 7764.84] back.
[7764.92 → 7765.64] The good news is they
[7765.64 → 7766.98] developed it for Borrowing
[7766.98 → 7768.50] which is probably as far as
[7768.50 → 7770.42] games that old go the one
[7770.42 → 7772.02] that people are most likely
[7772.02 → 7773.20] to actually go back and
[7773.20 → 7773.42] play.
[7773.52 → 7774.08] Especially because of
[7774.08 → 7775.30] mods like Sky wind which
[7775.30 → 7776.26] make it look amazing
[7776.26 → 7777.58] because they're using like
[7777.58 → 7778.16] Skyrim stuff.
[7778.30 → 7778.44] Whatever.
[7778.94 → 7779.84] Anyway he's on our
[7779.84 → 7780.10] forum.
[7780.48 → 7780.96] Check it out.
[7781.10 → 7781.84] He's got a thread about
[7781.84 → 7782.02] it.
[7782.52 → 7783.22] Go watch his video.
[7783.58 → 7784.02] Cool stuff.
[7784.22 → 7784.60] I'm not going to talk
[7784.60 → 7785.06] about it for way too
[7785.06 → 7785.78] long but cool stuff.
[7786.72 → 7787.32] Is it true that you
[7787.32 → 7788.16] don't work for NCI
[7788.16 → 7788.50] anymore?
[7788.62 → 7789.78] I still make videos on
[7789.78 → 7790.70] NCI Tech Tips.
[7790.82 → 7792.00] You probably see them.
[7792.30 → 7793.06] They're still being
[7793.06 → 7794.86] uploaded every week but I
[7794.86 → 7795.78] am no longer in a
[7795.78 → 7797.16] product management or
[7797.16 → 7798.72] general management position
[7798.72 → 7799.24] there anymore.
[7800.54 → 7801.38] Didn't you like working
[7801.38 → 7801.78] at home?
[7801.78 → 7802.68] Yeah it's nice to roll
[7802.68 → 7803.64] out of bed and be at
[7803.64 → 7804.54] work but.
[7805.04 → 7806.30] You're also at work at
[7806.30 → 7806.48] home.
[7807.00 → 7808.74] I also work stupid hours
[7808.74 → 7809.92] like I'm going to get off
[7809.92 → 7811.68] this live stream having
[7811.68 → 7812.78] worked a full day already
[7812.78 → 7814.28] not having done anything
[7814.28 → 7815.44] but work, and then I'm
[7815.44 → 7816.48] going to go upload some
[7816.48 → 7817.74] videos and work more and
[7817.74 → 7818.28] then I'm going to sleep.
[7818.54 → 7820.08] For context for us
[7820.08 → 7822.16] Fridays are usually 16 to
[7822.16 → 7822.98] 18-hour days.
[7823.34 → 7824.24] When will Slick get a
[7824.24 → 7825.56] promotion, and what will he
[7825.56 → 7826.28] have to do for it?
[7826.34 → 7827.18] Oh I know what he'll have
[7827.18 → 7827.52] to do.
[7827.82 → 7828.54] Oh no.
[7828.74 → 7830.06] Oh you didn't even just.
[7830.06 → 7832.22] Oh no.
[7833.02 → 7833.96] Oh that's horrible.
[7834.32 → 7835.06] Do you think your benches
[7835.06 → 7836.00] will change with warmer
[7836.00 → 7836.50] temperatures?
[7836.72 → 7837.26] No not really.
[7838.98 → 7840.02] Don't fire Slick.
[7840.08 → 7841.30] He did a great job while he
[7841.30 → 7841.78] was alone.
[7842.26 → 7842.58] Thanks man.
[7842.58 → 7843.82] I know how good of a job he
[7843.82 → 7844.52] does when he's alone.
[7845.68 → 7846.38] Come on.
[7846.64 → 7847.60] Thank you by the way.
[7847.66 → 7848.28] I appreciate that.
[7848.52 → 7849.74] Make your garage in the
[7849.74 → 7850.34] new place.
[7851.42 → 7853.86] Oh I don't know.
[7854.44 → 7855.54] I think we can do better
[7855.54 → 7856.14] than this.
[7857.48 → 7858.74] As much as I love our
[7858.74 → 7858.98] garage.
[7859.02 → 7860.52] We get the new place and
[7860.52 → 7862.52] just like board up all the
[7862.52 → 7863.52] doors and windows and like
[7863.52 → 7864.56] no one goes in there.
[7864.70 → 7865.68] We work in the garage.
[7865.86 → 7867.10] Speaking of how bad a job
[7867.10 → 7868.12] we did at the garage didn't
[7868.12 → 7869.04] you spend thousands of
[7869.04 → 7869.88] dollars upgrading your
[7869.88 → 7870.00] garage.
[7870.00 → 7871.24] No I spent like 300
[7871.24 → 7871.64] bucks.
[7872.16 → 7872.94] And that was mostly on
[7872.94 → 7873.44] like paint.
[7873.84 → 7874.52] Yeah paint.
[7874.62 → 7875.68] To do like that red.
[7875.76 → 7875.88] Yeah.
[7876.02 → 7876.98] The funny thing is my
[7876.98 → 7878.20] garage is going to be so
[7878.20 → 7879.48] ridiculous now because
[7879.48 → 7880.70] like.
[7880.80 → 7881.24] There's going to be this
[7881.24 → 7882.80] like random red wall.
[7883.06 → 7883.30] So here.
[7883.72 → 7884.38] You're going to have to
[7884.38 → 7884.64] yeah.
[7888.54 → 7889.68] Here you'll have to give
[7889.68 → 7891.04] them like the walkthrough.
[7891.14 → 7892.02] So this is the tech
[7892.02 → 7892.58] quickie set.
[7893.00 → 7893.74] Hold on hold on.
[7893.84 → 7895.10] You're going really fast.
[7895.24 → 7896.34] So this is the pile of
[7896.34 → 7896.64] garbage.
[7896.64 → 7898.42] This is the storage slash
[7898.42 → 7901.12] pile of garbage slash like
[7901.12 → 7902.06] random things that we
[7902.06 → 7904.12] haven't worked on etc.
[7904.82 → 7906.06] This is like where we keep
[7906.06 → 7906.76] a lot of the camera
[7906.76 → 7907.14] equipment.
[7907.62 → 7908.48] Hold on I'm going to
[7908.48 → 7909.54] unlock it so that I can.
[7909.72 → 7910.86] He's doing something one
[7910.86 → 7910.98] sec.
[7911.10 → 7911.82] That's where we keep
[7911.82 → 7912.82] miscellaneous camera
[7912.82 → 7913.96] equipment that isn't like
[7913.96 → 7916.18] in use or sitting on a
[7916.18 → 7917.12] desk because someone forgot
[7917.12 → 7917.64] to put it there.
[7918.02 → 7919.94] Those are grills to go
[7919.94 → 7920.72] over top of our Kino
[7920.72 → 7921.24] Flow lights.
[7921.58 → 7922.82] That's some random thing
[7922.82 → 7923.72] that we were probably
[7923.72 → 7925.00] working on at some point.
[7925.00 → 7925.98] That was on the stream
[7925.98 → 7926.48] last week.
[7926.80 → 7927.60] It's the Mine N900.
[7927.96 → 7928.58] That's not the one we
[7928.58 → 7929.00] gave away though.
[7929.02 → 7929.66] You can't see it.
[7929.96 → 7930.52] No I can't.
[7932.58 → 7933.80] I have terrible eyes.
[7933.88 → 7934.96] My glasses are shattered.
[7935.82 → 7936.88] This is the tech quickie
[7936.88 → 7937.94] set so that white background
[7937.94 → 7939.24] you see is that.
[7940.82 → 7941.18] Anyway.
[7941.70 → 7942.94] And then we get to
[7942.94 → 7944.36] Check out the gap in the
[7944.36 → 7944.68] wall.
[7944.76 → 7945.68] The epic like
[7945.68 → 7946.54] The paint.
[7946.80 → 7947.98] Linus decided to stop
[7947.98 → 7949.40] painting gap which is
[7949.40 → 7950.94] just fantastic.
[7951.32 → 7952.46] Then it gets to the red
[7952.46 → 7953.84] background which is like
[7953.84 → 7954.72] Try not to show the
[7954.72 → 7955.06] ceiling.
[7955.60 → 7956.08] Because the ceiling is
[7956.08 → 7956.22] terrible.
[7956.44 → 7957.24] Check out that cloth.
[7957.50 → 7958.28] He thought that was such
[7958.28 → 7959.46] a fantastic idea because
[7959.46 → 7960.44] he's like oh it'll help
[7960.44 → 7961.30] the lighting in the room.
[7961.44 → 7963.04] I said maybe it'll help
[7963.04 → 7964.08] the lighting in the room.
[7964.50 → 7965.36] And he dropped some
[7965.36 → 7966.16] pins while he was doing
[7966.16 → 7967.16] it so we all just like
[7967.16 → 7968.14] fear for our feet the
[7968.14 → 7968.64] entire time.
[7968.92 → 7969.62] There's some graphics
[7969.62 → 7971.32] cards in a bin under my
[7971.32 → 7971.66] desk.
[7972.32 → 7973.22] There's one of my
[7973.22 → 7973.48] desks.
[7973.54 → 7974.06] I was talking about
[7974.06 → 7974.74] Titan for a little bit
[7974.74 → 7975.20] while you were gone.
[7975.20 → 7977.78] There's my benching
[7977.78 → 7979.14] area which is just like
[7979.14 → 7980.28] in the middle of a set.
[7982.16 → 7982.60] No.
[7983.00 → 7984.16] You always do this.
[7984.74 → 7985.54] Go away.
[7987.90 → 7988.68] Unhappy slick.
[7989.46 → 7990.56] There's like random
[7990.56 → 7991.54] mic stuff.
[7992.02 → 7992.56] I can't really move
[7992.56 → 7992.96] that out of the way.
[7993.16 → 7994.10] There's NZXT helmet
[7994.10 → 7995.02] that's on top of part of
[7995.02 → 7995.68] the set stuff.
[7996.06 → 7996.68] Some more random
[7996.68 → 7997.04] things.
[7997.04 → 7998.02] We try to keep that
[7998.02 → 7999.34] shelf populated although
[7999.34 → 8001.02] it is actually partially
[8001.02 → 8002.42] legitimate storage.
[8003.74 → 8004.74] His gel.
[8005.20 → 8006.32] Because he always has
[8006.32 → 8007.42] to do his hair before
[8007.42 → 8009.08] I'm trying to get
[8009.08 → 8009.38] out of the way.
[8009.64 → 8010.12] Because he always has
[8010.12 → 8011.02] to do his hair before
[8011.02 → 8011.98] Tech Quickie episodes.
[8013.24 → 8014.88] More random actual
[8014.88 → 8015.30] storage.
[8016.78 → 8017.84] This is a lot of
[8017.84 → 8018.54] footage of a shelf.
[8019.52 → 8019.74] Probably.
[8019.88 → 8020.04] Oh.
[8020.72 → 8021.36] There we go.
[8022.32 → 8022.76] Stop.
[8024.40 → 8025.16] There's Diesel's
[8025.16 → 8025.94] workstation and the
[8025.94 → 8026.38] garage door.
[8026.54 → 8027.50] Again Linus decided to
[8027.50 → 8028.52] stop painting which is
[8028.52 → 8029.06] fantastic.
[8029.32 → 8030.60] There's his camera so
[8030.60 → 8031.38] he can make sure we
[8031.38 → 8032.32] don't screw around.
[8033.56 → 8035.18] It's a very police
[8035.20 → 8035.98] state up in here.
[8036.76 → 8037.22] Anyway.
[8038.04 → 8038.94] Diesel's workstation
[8038.94 → 8040.22] that is behind.
[8040.56 → 8041.28] This is the streaming
[8041.28 → 8041.64] PC.
[8042.84 → 8044.56] With all of its input
[8044.56 → 8045.22] and output cards.
[8046.60 → 8047.62] Which is just kind of
[8047.62 → 8048.06] fantastic.
[8048.80 → 8049.34] And then.
[8051.50 → 8053.14] This is anti-static
[8053.14 → 8053.88] hard drive foam.
[8054.76 → 8055.86] That we decided to
[8055.86 → 8056.58] nail to the ceiling.
[8056.84 → 8057.54] Some of it's partially
[8057.54 → 8058.22] falling off.
[8058.48 → 8059.88] This is to help stop
[8059.88 → 8060.48] echoing.
[8061.00 → 8061.36] Theoretically.
[8061.66 → 8061.96] Although.
[8062.54 → 8063.16] That's a pretty bad
[8063.16 → 8063.48] theory.
[8063.72 → 8064.30] Because I don't think
[8064.30 → 8064.68] it works.
[8064.84 → 8065.14] At all.
[8065.50 → 8065.68] But.
[8066.16 → 8066.56] Anyway.
[8066.96 → 8067.54] We're getting back to
[8067.54 → 8068.00] storage there.
[8068.20 → 8068.70] Show them your
[8068.70 → 8069.76] scientific set.
[8069.90 → 8071.16] That's his stringing
[8071.16 → 8071.44] machine.
[8072.44 → 8074.04] So under that is his
[8074.04 → 8074.32] stringing machine.
[8074.32 → 8074.80] Do you want me to go
[8074.80 → 8075.54] take the cover off?
[8075.62 → 8075.64] Yeah.
[8076.44 → 8077.10] Under that is his
[8077.10 → 8077.66] stringing machine.
[8077.66 → 8078.46] So he uses that to
[8078.46 → 8079.48] string badminton rackets.
[8080.88 → 8081.62] Fairly expensive.
[8081.76 → 8082.28] But worth it.
[8082.34 → 8082.82] If you string a
[8082.82 → 8083.66] badminton racket a lot.
[8084.24 → 8084.84] There's the green
[8084.84 → 8085.38] screen that we use
[8085.38 → 8086.00] for a lot of stuff.
[8086.30 → 8087.14] And there's the like
[8087.14 → 8087.86] quote unquote
[8087.86 → 8088.88] scientific area.
[8088.98 → 8089.54] Oh that's his
[8089.54 → 8089.84] chiller.
[8090.78 → 8091.36] That's his chiller.
[8091.46 → 8092.16] So that's a
[8092.16 → 8093.72] currently dead project
[8093.72 → 8095.42] that he used to
[8095.42 → 8097.38] cool a computer
[8097.38 → 8098.26] ridiculously well.
[8098.58 → 8100.24] But it's kind of
[8100.24 → 8100.74] a lot of work.
[8100.84 → 8101.38] And kind of not
[8101.38 → 8102.00] entirely working.
[8102.18 → 8103.22] So maybe someday.
[8104.06 → 8105.04] But looking at the
[8105.04 → 8105.70] progress of his
[8105.70 → 8106.28] current rig.
[8106.34 → 8107.38] Maybe not someday.
[8107.66 → 8108.70] This is cable salad
[8108.70 → 8109.40] because we have
[8109.40 → 8110.32] cable salad everywhere.
[8110.62 → 8111.82] Because I don't know
[8111.82 → 8112.64] how you can't have
[8112.64 → 8113.46] cable salad where you
[8113.46 → 8114.40] have to film everything
[8114.40 → 8115.24] and there's technology
[8115.24 → 8115.68] everywhere.
[8118.24 → 8119.86] I would like to have
[8119.86 → 8121.54] an actually like
[8121.54 → 8123.00] well cabled room.
[8123.24 → 8124.18] But in a temporary
[8124.18 → 8125.08] garage setup that's
[8125.08 → 8125.58] not going to happen.
[8125.68 → 8126.56] Maybe our new set.
[8126.80 → 8127.64] I want to like
[8127.64 → 8128.66] actually run certain
[8128.66 → 8129.68] cables along the roof
[8129.68 → 8130.32] and like actually
[8130.32 → 8131.00] strap things down
[8131.00 → 8131.34] properly.
[8131.46 → 8132.10] But that'll have to
[8132.10 → 8134.04] be the new set.
[8134.18 → 8134.38] Later.
[8134.78 → 8134.98] Bro.
[8135.24 → 8136.26] Not in this temporary
[8136.26 → 8137.64] area which should
[8137.64 → 8138.58] actually be used
[8138.58 → 8139.14] as a garage.
[8139.14 → 8140.10] My garage is going
[8140.10 → 8141.50] to look so ridiculous
[8141.50 → 8142.26] when I pull all
[8142.26 → 8142.98] this stuff out of it.
[8143.06 → 8144.20] You should actually
[8144.20 → 8145.56] like repaint it.
[8146.46 → 8146.86] Why?
[8146.94 → 8147.76] It's a garage.
[8148.64 → 8149.22] But like.
[8150.24 → 8150.54] Oh.
[8150.90 → 8151.32] I know.
[8151.38 → 8151.96] It's going to look
[8151.96 → 8153.14] absolutely ludicrous.
[8153.18 → 8153.56] Just so weird.
[8153.56 → 8153.98] When I pull those
[8153.98 → 8155.02] walls out and like
[8155.02 → 8155.82] it's just like this
[8155.82 → 8156.86] red and blue thing.
[8156.86 → 8157.50] So weird.
[8158.00 → 8158.62] I mean if we'd at
[8158.62 → 8159.32] least gone with like
[8159.32 → 8160.44] a clean line there
[8160.44 → 8161.12] it might have helped.
[8161.30 → 8162.12] But yeah.
[8162.12 → 8163.12] Anyway.
[8163.30 → 8163.84] I think that's it
[8163.84 → 8164.52] for the live stream
[8164.52 → 8165.08] tonight guys.
[8165.20 → 8166.02] Thank you so much
[8166.02 → 8166.58] for watching.
[8166.74 → 8169.18] You're all awesome.
[8169.90 → 8170.42] Thanks for hanging
[8170.42 → 8171.34] through my solo part.
[8172.56 → 8173.02] For the most part.
[8173.04 → 8173.68] He was like riding
[8173.68 → 8175.02] solo like Jason Derulo.
[8176.16 → 8177.26] You kind of look like him.
[8177.46 → 8177.70] Do I?
[8178.00 → 8178.54] Except your white.
[8178.76 → 8179.76] I actually have no idea
[8179.76 → 8180.40] who that is.
[8180.42 → 8180.84] I don't even know
[8180.84 → 8181.36] if he's white.
[8182.48 → 8183.34] No idea who you're
[8183.34 → 8183.60] talking about.
[8183.60 → 8184.28] I've heard his song.
[8184.82 → 8185.52] It's like a lot of
[8185.52 → 8186.02] auto-tune.
[8186.10 → 8186.70] It's not very good.
[8186.84 → 8188.06] I don't really listen
[8188.06 → 8188.84] to music like that.
[8189.16 → 8189.48] Yeah.
[8189.76 → 8190.06] No.
[8190.06 → 8194.06] How do we turn this off?
[8194.28 → 8195.34] We've got to click a thing
[8195.34 → 8195.96] at some point.
[8196.20 → 8197.28] Thanks for tuning in.
[8197.58 → 8198.36] Tune in next week.
[8199.14 → 8200.28] Same bat time.
[8200.76 → 8202.06] Same bat channel.
[8203.80 → 8204.68] Same bat man.
[8206.56 → 8207.70] We might replace you.
