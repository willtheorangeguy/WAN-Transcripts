[0.00 → 8.88] All right, I think that we're up and running. Here's your controller, sir. I think we're up and running.
[9.84 → 15.06] And apparently I only have eight left. Oh, my controller's not working. I thought you said you configured this.
[15.86 → 16.16] I did.
[17.64 → 21.86] Oh, are you player one now? Okay, go ahead. You're Mario then. Fine.
[22.02 → 23.34] Cool. What are we up here?
[23.34 → 31.74] I no longer care at this point in time. Yeah, it's just not possible to care that much anymore.
[31.96 → 38.94] I'm moving the monitor a bit. It'll be nice to play with no lag, though. Apparently there are zero viewers. Everyone tuned out.
[39.84 → 45.64] So 720p is up. And yeah, we're only doing 720p because I am on power line.
[45.64 → 50.14] And yeah, the game probably looks the same anyway. I just can't imagine there was that much of a difference.
[50.14 → 59.18] Wow. That piece of glass right there, right on the edge, is right in my calf. That's going to be a problem.
[59.70 → 62.66] Unless I just kind of do this. There we go. Sort of.
[63.72 → 71.10] So people keep telling us to use Open Broadcaster. Guys, XSplit was not the problem. Our emulator was not the problem.
[71.10 → 78.88] The problem was actually caused by, it looks like, here, I'm just going to grab it while Slick tries to be the ghost house.
[78.96 → 79.78] Good luck with that, Slick.
[79.78 → 101.20] Good luck with that.
[101.20 → 103.04] I was actually doing okay, and then you did that.
[104.04 → 105.08] Did I ruin everything?
[105.78 → 108.22] I was actually finally doing okay.
[110.48 → 112.58] I'm sorry. I don't even know if they have sound.
[113.42 → 116.04] Let me just go make sure that the default device is okay.
[119.56 → 122.38] I'm sorry. I actually couldn't sit like that with my ankle.
[123.24 → 123.68] Like that.
[124.44 → 126.32] Like that was not going to be a good thing.
[126.32 → 128.40] Okay.
[129.54 → 130.80] Uh, oh, okay.
[132.42 → 133.98] It's going to default device.
[135.78 → 136.94] It's going to default device.
[137.02 → 137.74] Okay, is this going to be a...
[137.74 → 138.74] You know what? Here we go.
[139.78 → 140.60] Is it working?
[140.60 → 140.86] We're on the webcam.
[141.06 → 141.52] Is it working?
[141.68 → 142.26] We're on the webcam.
[142.58 → 143.64] I think there's sound.
[143.88 → 145.54] I think there's sound from the webcam.
[145.98 → 147.26] It's recording something.
[147.74 → 148.86] I don't know if it's working.
[149.46 → 150.44] I don't know if it's working.
[151.34 → 152.30] I don't know if it's working.
[153.26 → 153.88] It's good.
[154.18 → 154.52] Yes.
[155.04 → 155.92] Game audio is low.
[155.92 → 156.38] You know what?
[156.42 → 157.34] I don't care, you guys.
[159.40 → 162.08] I'm not able to address that right now.
[163.34 → 163.74] Oh.
[164.84 → 165.24] Wow.
[165.28 → 166.30] Are you still alive?
[166.50 → 166.76] Yeah.
[167.02 → 167.94] I don't know where I'm going though.
[168.02 → 169.02] That is unbelievable.
[169.28 → 170.74] I can control it a lot better this time.
[170.82 → 173.62] I'm also not having a headache the entire time.
[173.88 → 174.52] Yeah, that's good.
[175.18 → 176.88] Wasn't that awful last week?
[176.96 → 177.80] That was actually terrible.
[178.02 → 180.22] Like it was beyond not playable.
[180.42 → 182.10] It was just actually not locatable.
[182.10 → 183.10] Wow.
[183.10 → 183.48] I don't know where I'm going.
[183.48 → 184.48] I don't know where I'm going.
[184.48 → 186.40] You're not only alive, but you're like big.
[186.78 → 186.98] Whoa.
[187.28 → 187.40] Oh.
[187.96 → 188.08] Oh.
[188.08 → 188.12] Oh.
[188.12 → 188.16] Oh.
[188.22 → 191.26] See, when you first unplugged the mic and knocked the monitor, I was going down that ramp.
[191.48 → 194.24] So I hit one of them, and I was like, no way.
[195.24 → 197.46] Because I was actually doing pretty okay at that point.
[197.46 → 198.82] It's like actually how I roll.
[199.78 → 200.26] Rumble, come here.
[200.26 → 202.28] I have no idea where I'm going though.
[202.48 → 203.26] Rumble, come here.
[204.02 → 205.36] Now I'm going to let you try and figure it out.
[205.38 → 206.14] I played this section right.
[206.20 → 206.42] All right.
[206.78 → 207.10] Rumble.
[209.10 → 210.30] Are you going to join us?
[210.30 → 210.96] I hate these things.
[211.00 → 212.84] People keep asking for the cat to join us.
[212.88 → 213.72] You freaked him out.
[214.30 → 214.80] I know.
[214.88 → 216.76] Well, I yelled at him because he was-
[216.76 → 217.88] Oh, Rumble, I'm sorry, baby.
[217.98 → 218.42] Come here.
[218.80 → 219.22] Come on.
[219.40 → 219.58] Here.
[219.68 → 220.62] I'll make room for you on my lap.
[220.76 → 221.02] Come here.
[221.74 → 222.20] Come on.
[222.64 → 223.36] Come on, sweetheart.
[223.62 → 224.64] There you go.
[225.86 → 226.84] Say hi, everyone.
[227.46 → 228.66] Say hi, Rumble cat.
[229.30 → 230.82] I got pretty mad at him when-
[230.82 → 231.60] That was a bad idea.
[233.84 → 233.88] When-
[233.88 → 235.26] Oh, Rumble.
[235.36 → 235.64] No, no.
[236.00 → 237.52] Oh, he's nuzzling my laptop.
[237.70 → 239.16] He's going to knock it off the couch.
[239.50 → 244.28] I got pretty mad at him when I was trying to adjust the cables at the front of the computer
[244.28 → 244.78] over there.
[244.96 → 249.58] And he kept walking by with his tail and snuggling up against me and making me unplug cables.
[250.04 → 254.24] And then it didn't help that my headphones were stuck under something.
[254.52 → 255.68] Oh, you have to go through that one.
[255.68 → 256.94] So you have to clear those coins before you-
[256.94 → 258.74] So I have to clear the coins and then go through it.
[259.58 → 260.64] So I was like, Rumble!
[261.16 → 262.00] Get out of here!
[262.96 → 263.68] Oh, I'm sorry.
[263.74 → 264.06] No, baby.
[264.12 → 265.30] I'm not yelling at you right now.
[265.42 → 265.86] I'm sorry.
[266.26 → 266.62] I'm sorry.
[266.62 → 267.36] He's like, what?
[267.60 → 267.84] What?
[268.24 → 268.74] He looks up.
[268.82 → 269.74] He's like, no!
[270.48 → 271.68] What did I do wrong?
[271.96 → 272.76] What did I do?
[274.12 → 276.94] Do we have any topics for this at all?
[276.96 → 277.76] We kind of do.
[277.80 → 278.46] We kind of do.
[278.54 → 278.66] Do you have-
[278.66 → 280.22] I wrote some random stuff in there.
[280.30 → 281.04] Oh, Rumble.
[281.04 → 281.56] Okay.
[282.04 → 283.52] Either sit or go.
[283.68 → 283.82] Okay.
[286.24 → 289.98] Because I have no idea what our topics are for the after party.
[290.56 → 292.36] Oh, we wanted to talk about yoga pants.
[293.16 → 293.36] Yeah.
[293.60 → 294.70] Yoga pants are a scam.
[296.64 → 297.56] Oh, do you not need that?
[298.08 → 298.68] I don't remember.
[299.26 → 299.78] That's quints.
[299.92 → 300.14] Quints.
[300.32 → 300.78] Go, go, go.
[300.82 → 302.38] You've got like 48 seconds left, you know?
[302.54 → 303.64] Yeah, I didn't know where I was going.
[303.96 → 304.54] Oh, okay.
[305.06 → 305.82] I know where I'm going now.
[305.88 → 306.60] Okay, you know where to go?
[306.64 → 307.92] Do you think you can do it in 40 seconds?
[308.10 → 308.34] Maybe.
[308.34 → 310.32] Well, if not like that, you're not.
[312.06 → 313.22] Oh, you've got to get under that one.
[313.28 → 313.90] Go, go, go, go, go.
[314.28 → 314.64] Oh!
[314.94 → 315.40] That's okay.
[315.44 → 315.70] It's okay.
[315.72 → 315.96] It's okay.
[315.98 → 316.42] Don't worry about it.
[316.42 → 316.86] Don't worry about it.
[317.68 → 318.72] Oh, oh, oh.
[318.82 → 319.56] Wow, that was close.
[319.74 → 319.98] Timing.
[320.54 → 321.16] Wait, wait.
[321.26 → 321.62] You're on timing.
[321.62 → 323.12] That was fluke timing.
[323.28 → 324.54] That wasn't like intentional timing.
[324.68 → 324.90] No.
[325.98 → 326.64] Yeah, there you go.
[327.86 → 330.96] But yeah, yoga pants are a big scam because they make things look good.
[331.14 → 332.52] Oh, you forgot to clear the coins.
[332.58 → 333.36] You would have even made it.
[333.44 → 334.36] I cleared them last time.
[334.58 → 334.80] Oh.
[335.10 → 335.96] Oh, one second.
[336.06 → 337.00] Oh, my goodness.
[337.80 → 338.26] And you died.
[338.26 → 339.26] Oh, my goodness.
[339.26 → 339.62] Wow.
[340.50 → 342.40] I had to make that run like three times.
[342.48 → 343.92] Just wow.
[345.00 → 345.76] Time's up.
[346.46 → 346.90] Poop.
[347.70 → 350.22] How disappoint is that?
[350.98 → 352.10] Everyone's like, whoa.
[353.48 → 355.34] Okay, well, just to be...
[355.34 → 357.04] Wait, my controller's not working still.
[357.44 → 357.80] Why?
[358.10 → 358.52] I don't know.
[359.10 → 359.66] Let's find out.
[359.66 → 360.22] Input.
[361.06 → 361.38] Input.
[362.72 → 363.00] To.
[363.24 → 364.16] Oh, you set it to none.
[364.16 → 364.48] No.
[364.48 → 365.66] No.
[365.80 → 367.14] You watched me set it up.
[367.64 → 368.58] Okay, well, don't worry about it.
[368.58 → 369.04] I got this.
[369.66 → 370.38] I got this.
[370.44 → 371.06] I got this.
[371.06 → 372.04] I got this under control.
[372.32 → 372.88] What happened?
[373.24 → 376.46] Because you said, after I set it, you said I could just close the window, so I just closed
[376.46 → 376.72] the window.
[376.88 → 377.82] Do you have to save it or something?
[377.94 → 378.12] No.
[379.16 → 379.92] I don't know what happened.
[379.98 → 380.96] I'm not worried about it right now.
[381.20 → 384.58] I'm really looking forward to having proper SNES controllers for this, though.
[384.78 → 384.98] Yeah.
[385.14 → 386.10] And I really wish...
[386.10 → 386.22] Oh.
[386.44 → 389.58] Without the input lag, it's way better, but this D-pad still sucks, so it would be nice
[389.58 → 390.02] to have...
[390.02 → 394.94] And for all the helpful suggestions out there, which are helpful, that we should stream
[394.94 → 400.88] directly from a Super Nintendo, we know we don't have a streaming device that is capable
[400.88 → 404.32] of accepting an old composite input.
[404.56 → 405.56] That is the problem.
[405.72 → 407.14] Not that I don't have a Super Nintendo.
[407.42 → 408.60] Not that I don't have the game.
[408.90 → 413.86] I don't have the actual hardware that I need to do that.
[413.86 → 418.10] So I was trying to get my hands on a Ha page...
[418.10 → 419.52] Oh, crap.
[419.64 → 419.78] Whoops.
[420.76 → 426.78] I was trying to get my hands on a Ha page HD PVR Gamer Edition or whatever...
[426.78 → 427.34] Oh, crap.
[428.18 → 429.54] Or whatever it is.
[430.00 → 434.34] And I did not manage to do that, so...
[434.34 → 435.48] So, yeah.
[435.62 → 438.18] That's why we don't have that solution going.
[438.18 → 439.32] Otherwise, honestly, yeah.
[439.40 → 443.78] I would just be streaming directly from the Super Nintendo.
[443.86 → 444.86] So...
[444.86 → 446.80] You have to work with what you got.
[447.06 → 450.70] So we had a Live Gamer Portable, which might be dead, might not be dead.
[450.98 → 455.88] I didn't have time to re-download the drivers for that one and download the drivers for the
[455.88 → 460.26] Live Gamer HD, which is the PCIe card, which is now in my media PC.
[460.54 → 464.16] So we can actually monitor the stream up there on the TV while we sit here and play it.
[464.16 → 465.32] But, yeah.
[465.32 → 467.60] I didn't have time to try both.
[467.60 → 468.44] So I was like, okay.
[468.60 → 470.62] I'm going to go with the solution I know works.
[470.86 → 472.30] I'm going for the Live Gamer HD.
[472.64 → 474.60] And it turns out it's a bigger driver package.
[474.72 → 475.60] It's like 90 legs.
[476.58 → 477.60] Which shouldn't be that big.
[478.88 → 479.24] Terrible.
[479.36 → 480.20] It is when you have...
[480.20 → 482.54] But it is when their server's incredibly slow.
[483.08 → 483.28] Yeah.
[483.28 → 486.46] So, yeah.
[486.82 → 488.08] So I went to get that.
[488.54 → 489.02] And then...
[489.02 → 490.62] What were some of the other problems we had?
[491.08 → 491.64] I don't know.
[491.68 → 492.14] There were a few.
[492.64 → 493.54] The USB hub.
[493.80 → 494.14] Oh, yeah.
[494.22 → 495.02] The USB hub.
[495.40 → 499.88] For all I know, the USB hub might have been part of the problem with the Live Gamer Portable.
[500.28 → 505.28] And then we also have a special HDMI cable that uses Red Mirror technology, which is an active
[505.28 → 508.66] technology, to reach its, like, 50-foot length.
[509.54 → 510.94] So there's that.
[511.18 → 512.14] Maybe that worked.
[512.26 → 513.68] The Live Gamer Portable or something.
[513.80 → 514.42] I don't know.
[514.72 → 516.56] So we had all these different things that we were doing.
[516.66 → 522.06] Like, the way it was supposed to work was I was going to use the two notebooks to stream.
[522.18 → 526.34] But then that wasn't gonna work because my wireless was flaking out.
[526.86 → 530.66] And so I wasn't sure if the stream would be good enough.
[530.66 → 535.56] We're actually streaming at 720p right now because, one, Shaw's been throttling us at 1080p.
[535.56 → 539.30] And number two is that I'm on Power line.
[539.38 → 542.12] And my Power line on that computer over there has been a little bit flaky.
[542.36 → 545.16] So I'm not sure if it's 100% okay.
[545.60 → 545.94] So, yeah.
[546.00 → 551.58] I guess since I don't really talk to Twitch chat much during the actual live streams,
[552.02 → 553.20] I'm gonna pop out Twitch chat.
[553.28 → 555.78] And maybe we're going to spend some time chatting with the Twitch chat.
[556.28 → 559.56] Because you guys don't get nearly the love that you guys deserve.
[559.56 → 567.02] You guys are awesome, and we can't be live streamers without people who actually watch us do this thing.
[567.36 → 569.66] So I'm going to put less strain on the...
[569.66 → 574.66] I didn't even realize I had the stream running on my laptop here, which probably isn't helping things.
[575.72 → 577.46] Someone asks if we watch anime.
[578.00 → 578.80] I don't.
[578.94 → 580.96] I think anime is phenomenally lame.
[580.96 → 587.02] It's like they just cheap out, and they don't bother animating any frames in between.
[587.14 → 590.50] My wife was watching old episodes of Sailor Moon the other day with the baby.
[591.02 → 595.22] And I was just like, okay, why do they even call it anime?
[595.48 → 598.24] They should call it like drawing still frames me.
[598.34 → 598.66] Draw me?
[598.92 → 599.76] Draw me.
[600.06 → 601.96] Because, yeah, it's like not...
[601.96 → 605.42] I watched Sword Art Online.
[605.56 → 606.96] I think that's the only...
[607.84 → 608.50] State? Start?
[612.82 → 613.22] Okay.
[613.48 → 615.22] Okay, well, something works there.
[615.88 → 617.10] You have all my lives.
[617.22 → 620.22] Oh, I transferred all my lives to you last time, but now I'm Luigi.
[620.54 → 620.76] Yeah.
[621.04 → 622.10] So I have all the lives.
[622.22 → 622.32] Yeah.
[622.64 → 622.96] All right.
[623.38 → 624.18] Vanilla Secret 1.
[624.36 → 625.98] I'll race you to Castle 4.
[626.60 → 627.58] Oh, that's weird.
[627.86 → 628.64] Whoa, what's going on?
[629.18 → 630.34] My control's messed up.
[630.34 → 632.66] I can't move to the left.
[632.72 → 633.00] Hold on.
[633.82 → 634.06] Oh.
[634.66 → 635.06] Okay.
[635.84 → 638.24] Well, everything I own was in a box to the left there.
[639.44 → 641.48] I don't remember the secret for this level.
[642.10 → 642.74] I...
[642.74 → 647.58] Like, I actually legitimately don't remember it.
[647.60 → 648.24] That's sort of weird.
[648.74 → 650.94] I know for sure I don't want a Fire Flower, though.
[651.94 → 653.10] So let's do this.
[653.34 → 655.30] Especially in a jumping level like this.
[655.82 → 657.18] That won't help me, like, at all.
[657.18 → 658.42] I think there's something here.
[659.76 → 660.20] Book, book.
[660.34 → 661.76] Oh, there it is.
[663.34 → 664.34] That memorization.
[664.78 → 665.72] I think there's probably...
[665.72 → 665.86] Yeah.
[667.38 → 667.98] Okay.
[668.98 → 674.86] Oh, I hate this.
[675.40 → 677.80] Oh, yeah.
[677.80 → 679.96] Oh, yeah.
[682.96 → 683.76] Not there.
[687.56 → 689.10] Okay, what's going on here?
[689.40 → 690.88] I can't remember.
[692.02 → 692.42] I know.
[692.54 → 693.72] I think I've missed it already.
[694.18 → 696.06] Like, I'm actually pretty sure I've missed it already.
[696.32 → 696.68] Yeah.
[696.68 → 697.98] Yeah, this is the normal end.
[698.04 → 699.04] I'll have to figure that out.
[701.48 → 703.98] 7870 Crossfire versus single 7970.
[704.20 → 704.84] You know what?
[704.88 → 706.82] I would probably go 7870 Crossfire.
[706.94 → 708.00] If you're worried about frame rating, though.
[708.48 → 709.00] Oh, right.
[709.10 → 710.18] Frame rating is a big issue.
[710.60 → 715.56] Not to mention the 7970 has three gigs of graphics memory, which is going to be better for high-res gameplay.
[715.56 → 715.60] Okay.
[717.70 → 718.34] You know what?
[718.42 → 719.58] I guess neither.
[719.84 → 720.88] Single 7950.
[722.80 → 723.16] Right?
[723.36 → 723.54] Yeah.
[723.88 → 724.12] Yeah?
[724.34 → 724.58] Yeah.
[725.24 → 725.58] Yeah.
[725.58 → 728.58] I mean, there's very little justification for buying the very premium.
[728.74 → 729.74] What are you doing, exactly?
[730.18 → 731.10] I'm trying to figure out.
[731.62 → 732.36] There's nothing there.
[732.42 → 732.80] Okay, yeah.
[732.88 → 735.42] No, my controls felt kind of weird for a sec, but I think I'm just crazy.
[737.88 → 741.72] The game I always used to play with myself on this level was tried to stand on the shaking skull,
[741.86 → 743.78] because for some reason there's always a shaking one.
[745.86 → 747.14] It's not something I would...
[747.14 → 748.32] It's like the game within the game.
[748.38 → 749.10] You don't have to do it.
[749.22 → 749.40] Right.
[749.82 → 753.92] But, yeah, there's very little justification for buying the very high-end cards.
[753.92 → 755.32] I mean, the thing about...
[755.32 → 761.62] Even the 7950 is not as good of a value as something like a 7870 or a 7850, for that matter.
[762.42 → 764.68] But it's a much better value than the 7970.
[764.78 → 770.28] I mean, we were looking at about a 30% increase in price, or like 25% increase in price last time we tested it,
[770.40 → 772.88] and we got, what, a 10% improvement in performance?
[773.80 → 774.16] 15%?
[774.52 → 775.58] That's usually where it sits.
[775.70 → 775.80] Yeah.
[775.88 → 778.14] So the value per dollar starts to go down a lot.
[778.14 → 787.46] Will asks if he should buy an HD 558 Sennheiser headphones.
[788.34 → 790.00] I love my 555s.
[790.02 → 792.32] The 558s, from what I've seen, are more of the same.
[793.06 → 794.52] Yeah, that was a good guess.
[795.12 → 795.90] You shouldn't spin jump.
[796.02 → 796.92] Spin jumping is bad.
[799.02 → 799.42] Okay.
[799.42 → 803.62] What if it's for a jump that you can no matter what make with either?
[804.66 → 806.40] But then it messes with, like, you're timing.
[807.52 → 807.80] I don't know.
[807.84 → 808.42] Just go forward.
[808.50 → 808.80] It's okay.
[809.32 → 810.50] 558s are good.
[811.24 → 814.44] But, yeah, so I figure more of the same.
[814.66 → 815.12] Should be good.
[815.96 → 817.32] Someone asked how badminton went.
[817.52 → 818.62] The first day was perfect.
[818.70 → 818.96] Go up.
[819.04 → 819.28] Go up.
[820.20 → 820.56] Doubles.
[821.12 → 823.92] Doubles was awesome.
[823.92 → 827.92] We didn't win our event, but we won the...
[828.60 → 832.84] So we lost our second match, which put us in B flight.
[833.00 → 834.90] So it was an BCD flight-style tournament.
[835.94 → 837.90] And so everyone starts in A flight.
[838.04 → 840.32] If you lose your first match, you go down to C flight.
[840.78 → 843.30] If you lose your second in a row, you go down to D flight.
[843.58 → 846.28] If you win one, then lose one, you go to B flight,
[846.40 → 849.66] which is the better tier of anyone who lost a round.
[849.96 → 852.84] So we won our first and lost our second.
[852.84 → 853.80] So we were in B flight.
[854.00 → 857.76] But the guys who won A flight, the guys who won the whole thing,
[857.90 → 861.02] and this is at the intermediate tier of the entire tournament in general.
[861.16 → 863.52] Like, we weren't playing at the very, like, elite level.
[864.10 → 870.50] But the guys who beat us in Red Shell, which is the tier we were in,
[870.74 → 873.80] won A flight, and we were the only ones who took them to three sets.
[874.06 → 875.72] We won our first set with them.
[876.00 → 880.14] And then our second set, we were actually up, like, 17 to 12
[880.14 → 882.36] or something stupid like that, and we let it get away from us.
[882.36 → 883.26] We should have won it.
[883.98 → 886.30] But they came back hard.
[886.54 → 887.18] They beat us.
[887.78 → 889.32] But it would have been a lot of fun.
[889.68 → 894.10] It's always good if you lose to, like, the people that just wreck everything.
[894.26 → 895.04] Lose to the guys.
[895.12 → 896.78] They beat everyone else two sets.
[896.88 → 897.42] They won the event.
[897.60 → 898.02] Yeah, yeah.
[898.18 → 899.92] And they even said at the end, they were like,
[900.14 → 902.46] it's funny, one of the guys was a Linus Tech Tips fan.
[902.60 → 902.82] Really?
[902.90 → 907.60] At the end, he's like, because he asked his partner if it was me,
[907.60 → 910.12] and then his partner's just like, dude, I don't know.
[910.68 → 912.82] And so his partner walks up to the net.
[913.04 → 915.34] It's like, hey, are you the guy from the NCI videos?
[915.72 → 916.92] And I'm like, yes.
[916.98 → 918.42] He's like, yeah, my partner's a fan.
[918.66 → 921.54] And then the guy's, like, so embarrassed at that point, right?
[922.90 → 923.74] That's pretty funny.
[923.96 → 925.02] Yeah, it was kind of awesome.
[925.16 → 926.82] And at the end, he's like, yeah, I watch all your videos.
[926.94 → 927.68] I'm like, that's cool.
[928.32 → 929.50] It's kind of neat, hey?
[929.90 → 930.10] Yeah.
[930.10 → 931.00] At first, it was weird.
[931.68 → 933.34] But you've had people talk to you, right?
[933.54 → 933.74] Yep.
[935.02 → 935.62] I don't know.
[935.80 → 936.54] I didn't think it was that weird.
[936.72 → 939.30] But I've been to more, like, events and stuff.
[939.90 → 941.00] Like, lands and stuff.
[941.04 → 941.80] Lands and stuff.
[944.30 → 946.42] More places that I would, like, kind of expect it.
[946.46 → 948.88] You're way better without the input lag, by the way.
[949.12 → 949.86] And without a headache.
[950.26 → 951.62] I honestly think it's more the headache.
[951.96 → 952.24] Right.
[952.90 → 954.32] Because, yeah, I mean, dying on two...
[954.32 → 956.80] Like, I still don't like this controller, but it's...
[956.80 → 958.66] Two Switch Palaces in a row dying?
[958.92 → 959.94] That's, like, a bad thing.
[959.96 → 960.34] No, I know.
[960.64 → 960.80] Yeah.
[961.48 → 964.66] I still don't like the controller, but at least I'm not, like, constantly crouching all the time,
[964.72 → 965.74] like I was with input lag.
[965.94 → 966.44] Do you remember that?
[966.58 → 966.74] Mm-hmm.
[966.78 → 968.52] I'm actually able to avoid that now.
[968.66 → 968.82] Right.
[968.82 → 969.76] That it's not being weird.
[970.02 → 971.48] It'd be so nice to have SNES controllers.
[971.48 → 972.54] Oh, for sure, yeah.
[972.68 → 973.42] That's going to be awesome.
[973.52 → 974.88] So we're racing to Castle 4, right?
[975.64 → 975.98] Sure.
[976.12 → 976.50] I don't even...
[976.50 → 977.90] I don't remember any...
[977.90 → 978.28] All right.
[978.54 → 979.70] Can you go down?
[979.86 → 980.78] You go down, don't you?
[980.84 → 982.10] I go up, you go down.
[982.30 → 983.54] But then you go down after.
[984.00 → 985.34] I'm not good at these levels, though.
[985.34 → 986.14] I haven't played them much.
[988.96 → 989.32] What?
[989.32 → 993.66] Your version with Super Mario World of not played much is probably still quite a bit.
[994.34 → 996.36] Well, I've, like, played them before.
[1001.46 → 1004.22] As he goes, like, guy to guy.
[1004.22 → 1004.90] Oh, crap.
[1004.90 → 1006.06] You almost had that.
[1006.40 → 1006.68] Didn't...
[1006.68 → 1007.98] You needed, like, one or two more.
[1007.98 → 1009.72] I did a couple more before I could get a win.
[1010.00 → 1010.24] Yeah.
[1011.18 → 1013.08] I should have left the tall one that time.
[1013.90 → 1014.58] Oh, oh!
[1015.06 → 1015.76] There you go.
[1016.66 → 1017.02] Yeah!
[1017.80 → 1018.44] Oh, no!
[1018.44 → 1018.74] No!
[1019.26 → 1020.38] Oh, I can still get the one up!
[1021.34 → 1022.14] Oh, whatever.
[1022.98 → 1024.14] Okay, why don't I just play the level?
[1024.14 → 1025.14] Oh, no!
[1025.88 → 1026.16] Ooh!
[1028.56 → 1029.04] Oh!
[1030.20 → 1030.68] Oh!
[1031.38 → 1033.10] I actually do want Joshi for this.
[1033.72 → 1034.08] Oh!
[1035.70 → 1036.78] Never abandon Joshi!
[1037.78 → 1038.22] Crap!
[1039.02 → 1039.68] There you go.
[1039.78 → 1040.04] Whatever.
[1040.50 → 1041.36] You got Joshi, though.
[1041.44 → 1042.00] That's what matters.
[1042.28 → 1043.18] Actually, it doesn't.
[1043.60 → 1045.96] I wish I had my capes rather than Joshi.
[1046.44 → 1047.52] Never abandon Joshi.
[1047.52 → 1055.76] Oh, I forgot about the bombs.
[1056.64 → 1057.66] Um, okay.
[1057.80 → 1059.10] Well, let's do this.
[1059.74 → 1060.48] Can I eat him?
[1060.60 → 1061.06] Yeah, I can.
[1061.94 → 1062.72] Oh, crap.
[1063.12 → 1063.86] Go away, bombs.
[1065.34 → 1066.68] I don't remember if there's a thing here.
[1067.74 → 1068.02] Nope.
[1068.26 → 1068.70] Boom!
[1069.60 → 1070.06] Oh, no.
[1070.12 → 1070.88] This must be, uh...
[1070.88 → 1072.48] Isn't there something to do with the notes or something?
[1073.10 → 1073.36] No.
[1073.64 → 1073.84] Oh!
[1074.18 → 1074.46] Whoa!
[1074.70 → 1075.38] Feather, thank you.
[1077.52 → 1079.56] I vaguely remember there being something in the notes.
[1079.68 → 1080.88] But I don't even know if that's this level.
[1081.20 → 1082.82] It might be a different level I'm remembering.
[1082.82 → 1084.14] Could be a completely different level.
[1084.36 → 1086.56] Or even a completely different game.
[1086.64 → 1088.00] That's actually possible.
[1088.20 → 1089.70] It could be a different Super Mario.
[1091.20 → 1092.02] Silver coins.
[1094.74 → 1096.44] Do you have to eat them all or you just...
[1096.44 → 1097.16] Oh, my goodness.
[1097.26 → 1098.66] My controller's pinned to the left again.
[1099.22 → 1099.74] Oh, crap.
[1099.86 → 1100.74] What did we do last time?
[1100.80 → 1101.20] Did you escape?
[1101.30 → 1102.16] Yeah, escape and escape.
[1105.38 → 1105.70] Nope.
[1105.78 → 1106.76] I'm still pinned to the left.
[1107.52 → 1108.12] Hold on.
[1108.18 → 1109.28] Let me just mash it a bit.
[1109.38 → 1109.54] Okay.
[1109.66 → 1110.02] Try it.
[1111.00 → 1111.62] There we go.
[1112.26 → 1113.24] Do you think it's the controller?
[1113.36 → 1113.82] Can I get it?
[1113.88 → 1114.84] Yes, I got two up.
[1115.34 → 1115.64] Nice.
[1116.06 → 1116.38] Sorry.
[1116.48 → 1116.80] Go ahead.
[1117.18 → 1117.50] Ah, yeah.
[1117.58 → 1118.26] I think it's the controller.
[1118.54 → 1119.38] That's kind of poppy.
[1120.20 → 1120.52] Oh, no.
[1120.52 → 1121.14] He's going to split.
[1121.56 → 1121.92] Aw.
[1123.60 → 1125.00] I never understood that mechanic.
[1125.74 → 1126.18] The split?
[1126.40 → 1126.62] Yeah.
[1127.74 → 1128.62] It's like...
[1128.62 → 1129.50] No.
[1129.80 → 1131.90] Football players don't turn into multiple people.
[1132.22 → 1132.64] They can.
[1133.44 → 1133.84] What?
[1133.84 → 1133.90] What?
[1133.90 → 1135.90] Whee!
[1142.36 → 1142.84] Boom.
[1143.22 → 1143.86] There we go.
[1144.20 → 1145.30] Aw, I'm at 97.
[1145.42 → 1146.36] I get to play the bonus game.
[1148.30 → 1150.84] Someone says, I never knew Linus did live-streaming.
[1151.28 → 1155.48] Well, you are not alone because we don't do live-streaming much.
[1155.72 → 1156.94] I wouldn't even call this.
[1156.94 → 1161.54] Bum Troll just got a Sennheiser 363D with a Sonar sound card.
[1161.62 → 1162.06] Very nice.
[1162.26 → 1162.52] Beast.
[1162.68 → 1163.64] Sorry, you wouldn't call this what now?
[1163.82 → 1165.64] I don't even know if I'd call this proper game streaming.
[1166.80 → 1167.20] Proper game streaming?
[1167.20 → 1169.78] I guess we're game streaming, but we're not like game streamers.
[1169.78 → 1169.96] Aw, I'm missed.
[1171.00 → 1172.08] They're starting to get a lot of them.
[1172.38 → 1174.50] I know, but it only counts if you get them all.
[1176.04 → 1176.74] Come on.
[1176.74 → 1182.34] Got my one-ups.
[1182.94 → 1184.56] Now I have 44 lives.
[1184.64 → 1186.22] We're like not even finished Vanilla Dome.
[1188.14 → 1190.42] And I haven't even been like spamming anything.
[1190.74 → 1190.92] No.
[1191.80 → 1192.54] All right, you're up.
[1196.42 → 1198.48] Someone says Slick wears awesome shorts.
[1198.92 → 1199.36] Shorts?
[1199.36 → 1200.72] Please answer this.
[1200.82 → 1201.90] Beats or Parrot Zeke?
[1202.78 → 1204.78] Well, for one thing, not Beats.
[1204.84 → 1206.16] Who's not looking at the screen?
[1206.20 → 1211.40] For another thing, the Parrot Zeke's really aren't the best audio quality you can get at the price point.
[1211.64 → 1214.84] But what's cool about them is the fact that they are wireless.
[1215.02 → 1218.02] They have the touch control, which honestly, I don't have them anymore.
[1218.18 → 1221.94] I gave them to the old NCI cameraman when I was done with them.
[1223.46 → 1226.46] But don't go down for that.
[1226.46 → 1230.90] But yeah, the thing about the Parrot Zeke's is that the touch control...
[1230.90 → 1232.44] You're going to get spammed here.
[1233.00 → 1234.46] The touch control is...
[1235.14 → 1237.20] You can keep going forward, but it's going to come soon.
[1237.58 → 1238.86] The touch control is really cool.
[1239.02 → 1241.52] And it was the one thing about them that I really found myself missing.
[1241.64 → 1245.08] Like the app is cool with audio control, but you can get...
[1245.08 → 1247.40] I mean, I'm using Power Amp right now for Android.
[1248.12 → 1254.32] And you can get stuff with a decent EQ, so you don't really need to adjust it inside your fancy pants headphones.
[1254.90 → 1256.18] Battery life was good.
[1256.18 → 1259.46] Audio quality was pretty darn good, especially when they're powered.
[1259.54 → 1261.34] When they weren't powered, they were nothing special.
[1261.76 → 1263.30] So you've got to make sure you keep them charged.
[1263.58 → 1267.78] But that touch control was actually really cool, and I miss that.
[1268.12 → 1272.72] But I'm more of an IEM guy just because, for me, headphones aren't really a fashion statement.
[1273.20 → 1275.90] So much as they are like, I want good quality.
[1276.02 → 1276.92] I want something convenient.
[1276.92 → 1279.82] And I'm so often on the go.
[1279.98 → 1281.28] Like, I'm all over the place.
[1281.28 → 1288.30] That it's much easier to not have things just get in my way and just carry Items in my pocket.
[1288.40 → 1291.14] So I'm using Steel Series Flux in your pros now.
[1291.54 → 1292.66] Really happy with them.
[1292.88 → 1298.36] Although I really don't find them that much better than the Fluxes in terms of, I don't know, just in general.
[1298.70 → 1300.90] But comply tips are cool, but they wear out so fast.
[1301.14 → 1302.14] Oh, so fast.
[1302.48 → 1305.76] Well, especially for you, with you leaving them out and the cats chewing them.
[1305.78 → 1306.22] The cats chewing them.
[1306.42 → 1308.76] But still, they do wear out quite quickly.
[1309.30 → 1310.10] Yoga pants tip.
[1310.16 → 1311.56] So yeah, yoga pants are deceptive.
[1311.80 → 1313.34] We never did even talk about this.
[1313.66 → 1316.44] Where it's just like, you look at them, and you're like, yeah, that could be nice.
[1316.46 → 1318.40] And then you're just like...
[1318.40 → 1318.70] Nope.
[1318.92 → 1319.24] Nope.
[1319.52 → 1319.76] Nope.
[1319.82 → 1320.02] Nope.
[1320.26 → 1321.32] It's like a bra for your butt.
[1321.48 → 1322.50] Yeah, bra for the butt.
[1322.78 → 1324.90] What's your opinion of the Sennheiser HD 590?
[1325.00 → 1325.64] You never used them.
[1326.06 → 1326.76] Wait, yes I have.
[1326.84 → 1328.46] Oh, wait, no, you have 595s.
[1328.56 → 1329.46] No, those are older, right?
[1329.70 → 1329.84] Yeah.
[1329.84 → 1333.34] Someone asks if I like the G700S.
[1333.48 → 1334.08] You know what?
[1334.50 → 1336.36] No leg, which is nice.
[1337.34 → 1338.42] G700 had a bit, right?
[1340.18 → 1341.46] G600 was the one that was leg.
[1341.56 → 1342.30] G600, right.
[1342.38 → 1342.74] Okay, yeah.
[1343.52 → 1344.08] And feather.
[1345.38 → 1346.18] I hate this level.
[1346.26 → 1346.64] Oh my god, dolphins!
[1347.44 → 1351.44] I love how these guys merited a mention in the manual, even though they're in like two levels.
[1353.48 → 1356.12] But yeah, G700S has perfect feel to it.
[1356.16 → 1356.92] Great ergonomics.
[1356.92 → 1363.72] Although I didn't like it quite as much as I like my Kari Laser, which is still my mouse of choice.
[1363.92 → 1364.94] I love the Kari...
[1364.94 → 1365.52] Oh, crap.
[1365.64 → 1365.84] Whoops.
[1366.26 → 1367.42] I'm pinned to the left again.
[1367.84 → 1368.10] Oh, really?
[1368.22 → 1368.38] There it goes.
[1368.42 → 1368.90] No, there it goes.
[1368.94 → 1369.22] It's okay.
[1369.28 → 1369.52] It's okay.
[1371.80 → 1375.62] I think I can take off here if I get the timing right.
[1377.56 → 1378.22] There we go.
[1378.48 → 1378.70] Nice.
[1378.70 → 1386.02] Um, yeah, my Kari Laser has just been my weapon of choice for so long that it's really hard to change.
[1386.52 → 1388.24] They discontinued it in our region, though.
[1388.26 → 1389.06] I don't know if you know that.
[1389.42 → 1393.02] Yeah, but I told you, like, I actually almost thought you were going to buy it.
[1393.18 → 1394.70] There was one at...
[1395.26 → 1397.70] One of my buddies was at a Best Buy, and there was one there.
[1397.70 → 1400.24] I would have considered buying it.
[1400.34 → 1400.90] I told you.
[1401.34 → 1405.92] The other one I'm really mad at myself for not buying is the G9X, because I have a G9,
[1406.10 → 1409.96] but NCI-X had a G9X Modern Warfare Edition for, like, $30.
[1410.64 → 1414.06] I should have just bought three of them, because the G9X is awesome.
[1414.76 → 1414.88] Yeah.
[1414.88 → 1417.76] Someone says, Linus, so what should I get?
[1417.80 → 1419.98] I got $500, but I don't know...
[1419.98 → 1424.00] I don't know what they were asking about, so I...
[1424.00 → 1427.74] Someone says, I've got $1,500 for a PC.
[1427.88 → 1429.08] Should I build on my own or buy one ready?
[1429.28 → 1430.58] Definitely build one on your own.
[1430.84 → 1433.36] We actually have a build guide coming really soon.
[1433.56 → 1437.64] That's a $1,500 PC, and it's basically just what you should buy.
[1437.64 → 1441.00] It's a $3570K H100i.
[1441.86 → 1442.62] You're going to want to get it.
[1442.62 → 1442.90] What?
[1442.90 → 1445.02] This is a tough castle.
[1445.46 → 1446.10] $35...
[1446.10 → 1446.56] Yeah, you're done.
[1447.70 → 1449.38] $3570K H100i.
[1451.76 → 1452.80] Don't spin jump.
[1453.06 → 1454.40] Why do you spin jump?
[1454.86 → 1455.94] You're going to die.
[1457.20 → 1458.66] Spin jump is no control.
[1462.68 → 1463.72] $660 Ti.
[1464.32 → 1465.04] We went with...
[1465.04 → 1465.26] Nope.
[1465.38 → 1466.26] That was probably terrible.
[1466.26 → 1472.76] We went with a 180GB SSD with a 3TB drive, because that gives you a lot of really poor...
[1472.76 → 1473.00] No.
[1473.00 → 1474.84] ...flexibility in terms of what you can do.
[1474.84 → 1490.24] You can go 180GB boot drive, 3TB storage drive, or you can go 120GB boot drive, 60GB cache for your 3TB storage drive, and then you can have your main applications in your OS running purely off SSD.
[1490.24 → 1500.04] Your main favourite games and chief applications running off of cached hard drive, and then you can have your bulk storage running off of a hard drive.
[1500.04 → 1502.16] And all of that fit within our budget pretty nicely.
[1502.16 → 1503.72] We went with a CM Storm Scout 2.
[1503.72 → 1509.22] Basically, Intel's only requirement for this build guide was, please use an Intel CPU.
[1510.72 → 1514.56] But other than that, I was given the flexibility to pick all my own components.
[1514.56 → 1526.38] And rather than finding other sponsors, particularly for the first time around, what I decided to do was only offer manufacturers the opportunity to sponsor it by sending hardware.
[1526.84 → 1529.12] So no cash sponsorship.
[1529.44 → 1533.62] Intel gave us money to make it sponsored by Intel, but that was it.
[1533.90 → 1535.40] So it's sponsored by Intel.
[1535.40 → 1540.16] It's not a purely paid project like some of the stuff that we're doing on Tech Quickie.
[1540.16 → 1543.22] So I wanted to keep it really clean.
[1543.42 → 1547.52] I wanted to make sure that there was no confusion over why we picked any of the components.
[1547.64 → 1550.94] It was all picked because these are components that I genuinely like.
[1551.00 → 1552.54] I got criticized for the Scout 2.
[1553.18 → 1557.10] But you know what I went through to get that Scout 2 for the sponsorship.
[1557.72 → 1562.42] I had to have Cooler Master overnight it in order to get it here in time.
[1563.68 → 1564.64] I like Scout 2.
[1564.90 → 1567.36] One of my good buddies has the original one.
[1567.82 → 1568.68] And it's actually really nice.
[1568.68 → 1570.36] If you go to lands a lot, it's pretty awesome.
[1570.76 → 1572.58] The bar is really, really, really steady.
[1572.58 → 1574.32] I love the build quality of the Scout 2.
[1574.40 → 1581.02] The only thing that I didn't actually like about the Scout 2 was the fact that your H100i has to be a little bit external.
[1581.22 → 1582.24] I showed you how it's installed.
[1582.40 → 1583.44] It's not that bad.
[1584.08 → 1585.22] But it's not perfect.
[1585.40 → 1587.06] No, I would take that label off the one end.
[1587.20 → 1588.16] I think that would help it a lot.
[1588.28 → 1589.26] Yep, that'll clean it up a lot.
[1590.44 → 1591.68] Oh, I hate Tenor.
[1592.26 → 1593.76] Oh, I hate Tenor with a cape.
[1594.04 → 1594.38] Oh, crap.
[1594.40 → 1594.94] Do you remember his name?
[1596.20 → 1596.52] Yeah?
[1596.54 → 1597.14] That's awesome.
[1597.14 → 1598.98] Shoot.
[1600.18 → 1600.74] That's okay.
[1600.78 → 1601.26] I got this.
[1602.30 → 1603.96] Oh, I hate fighting this guy.
[1604.36 → 1605.10] I actually...
[1605.10 → 1605.64] Whoops.
[1605.82 → 1606.46] Wow, that was close.
[1606.70 → 1609.12] I actually find him more difficult than most of the Koo pas.
[1609.60 → 1609.80] Yeah?
[1610.66 → 1610.88] Yeah.
[1610.88 → 1611.14] You got him.
[1611.30 → 1611.46] Whatever.
[1611.46 → 1614.20] Line is 660 versus 660 Ti Boost 2 gig.
[1614.60 → 1616.78] Great episode of NCI Tech Tips coming.
[1616.84 → 1617.22] 650 Ti Boost?
[1617.22 → 1618.78] What?
[1619.04 → 1619.46] No, yeah.
[1619.58 → 1621.80] 660 versus 650 Ti Boost.
[1621.80 → 1622.12] There we go.
[1623.34 → 1624.82] Great episode coming on this.
[1625.14 → 1631.44] Should you buy a beefed up lower end GPU or a vanilla higher end GPU?
[1631.78 → 1634.68] And the answer is higher end GPU no matter what.
[1634.94 → 1635.10] Yep.
[1635.16 → 1638.52] Get the cheapest higher end GPU versus a beefed up lower end GPU.
[1638.52 → 1640.46] We tested this on NCI Tech Tips.
[1640.76 → 1642.46] That episode's going to be coming pretty soon.
[1643.24 → 1644.58] So we're pretty excited about that.
[1645.22 → 1646.92] If he hits the thing, then you can fall through.
[1647.06 → 1647.26] Yeah.
[1648.72 → 1649.68] You're so done, though.
[1651.04 → 1651.36] Probably.
[1652.00 → 1655.92] You need to get a mushroom at some point because there's no way you're going to beat this boss without a mushroom.
[1656.10 → 1656.44] Here it is.
[1657.52 → 1657.70] Okay.
[1657.74 → 1659.28] Stay on the other side so that he hits the thing.
[1660.28 → 1661.42] Oh, he has good aim.
[1661.52 → 1661.64] Right.
[1661.68 → 1662.56] I forgot he had shots.
[1662.74 → 1663.00] Sorry.
[1663.58 → 1665.92] That was like 100% my bad.
[1666.88 → 1667.58] What does this do?
[1667.94 → 1669.74] That gives you a halfway point.
[1670.38 → 1671.92] So if you can get through there.
[1672.00 → 1673.16] I think that does that right there.
[1673.34 → 1673.62] Yes.
[1674.56 → 1675.74] I don't know if you can get in.
[1676.26 → 1680.24] So if you hit that door, then you get a halfway marker so that you don't have to.
[1680.24 → 1680.66] Just go.
[1680.66 → 1681.48] You can sprint it.
[1681.58 → 1682.02] You can sprint it.
[1682.08 → 1682.56] Go, go, go.
[1685.36 → 1688.32] But yeah, it makes it so that you don't have to go through this beginning part again.
[1689.28 → 1690.54] Go, go, go, go, go.
[1691.12 → 1691.86] You're almost there.
[1693.16 → 1693.48] Nice.
[1693.52 → 1694.48] I don't have a mushroom, though.
[1694.58 → 1695.46] Is he in this part?
[1695.66 → 1696.08] What's in this part?
[1696.10 → 1696.86] You can get a mushroom here.
[1696.90 → 1697.30] Wait, wait.
[1697.42 → 1697.64] Lava.
[1697.80 → 1698.02] Lava.
[1698.84 → 1700.40] What do you think of Cherry MX Greens?
[1700.68 → 1702.10] We only tried them very briefly.
[1702.22 → 1703.52] I thought they were a little bit too heavy.
[1703.64 → 1703.86] Slick?
[1704.38 → 1707.96] I liked them, but like he said, we only tried them very briefly.
[1707.96 → 1713.16] I didn't actually get any extended use with it, so I don't know if I would like them for an extended period of time.
[1713.36 → 1714.26] A lot of people say they're heavy.
[1714.40 → 1715.82] I don't think I'm going to have a problem with that.
[1717.24 → 1717.98] So, yeah.
[1718.20 → 1718.54] I don't know.
[1718.54 → 1720.82] Maybe if your hands didn't weigh a billion pounds, it wouldn't matter.
[1720.82 → 1723.08] Maybe if my hands didn't weigh a billion pounds.
[1724.20 → 1728.54] Someone asks, would you ever do a live Skype call with Logan, Paul, and Kyle?
[1728.66 → 1730.10] Talk about tech like you normally do.
[1730.40 → 1730.88] You know what?
[1730.92 → 1734.60] The kinds of conversations Logan, Paul, Kyle, and I...
[1734.60 → 1735.96] Oh, I don't think you can make it unless...
[1735.96 → 1736.38] There you go.
[1736.38 → 1737.38] Have...
[1737.38 → 1737.50] Have...
[1737.50 → 1739.60] Are probably not appropriate for streaming.
[1739.60 → 1740.60] I can do something.
[1742.14 → 1742.66] Um...
[1742.66 → 1744.90] I can do something.
[1745.26 → 1745.62] Oh!
[1745.88 → 1746.48] I missed something.
[1746.62 → 1748.92] Someone had a pretty good question, and I think I missed it.
[1749.72 → 1750.10] Oh, yeah.
[1750.16 → 1753.60] Someone was asking if the Sensei Raw is pretty equivalent to the Kari Laser.
[1753.94 → 1754.32] You know what?
[1754.32 → 1761.56] The thing that I love so much about the Kari Laser is the CPI granularity down to one CPI.
[1761.56 → 1761.80] Yeah.
[1761.94 → 1764.24] And I think only their very high-end mice have that.
[1764.38 → 1767.68] And I think the Raw doesn't count, but I may be mistaken.
[1768.12 → 1769.14] I haven't tried the Sensei Raw.
[1769.14 → 1772.02] I remember we checked this out with a few of them, but I don't remember which ones.
[1772.12 → 1776.34] Yeah, I remember being confused because there was one that I unboxed that didn't have the
[1776.34 → 1779.12] individual CPI adjustment.
[1779.28 → 1779.70] And you thought it was going to.
[1779.76 → 1781.46] And I thought it was going to, but then it didn't.
[1781.68 → 1782.90] I don't remember which one that was, though.
[1784.84 → 1785.86] I hope I can make this next...
[1785.86 → 1786.34] Oh, crap.
[1787.08 → 1787.56] Come down!
[1787.66 → 1788.06] Come down!
[1788.14 → 1788.52] Come down!
[1788.60 → 1789.04] Come down!
[1789.04 → 1789.08] Come down!
[1790.74 → 1792.04] There we go.
[1793.42 → 1794.92] It's all about staying at the very front.
[1796.18 → 1796.50] Whoops.
[1798.50 → 1798.86] Yay!
[1798.86 → 1799.26] Safety!
[1799.62 → 1800.72] Oh, no!
[1801.18 → 1802.72] No, no, no, no, no, no!
[1803.06 → 1803.42] Boo!
[1804.26 → 1804.50] Whoops!
[1805.88 → 1807.80] Oh, it looks like I could have...
[1807.80 → 1808.54] I don't know what up here.
[1808.70 → 1808.90] Oops.
[1809.42 → 1810.12] Forgot about that.
[1812.68 → 1814.16] I love the music on these levels.
[1814.24 → 1814.82] It's so upbeat.
[1816.94 → 1819.90] I'll miss Nintendo when they don't exist anymore because of the Wii U.
[1820.40 → 1822.24] Oh, we didn't talk about that, did we?
[1822.24 → 1822.56] I know.
[1822.66 → 1823.48] We didn't talk about them last year.
[1823.48 → 1824.46] That's a brutal coin.
[1824.88 → 1826.18] Oh, I guess you have to bounce over with it.
[1826.18 → 1827.80] Yeah, I'm not going to go for it.
[1827.94 → 1828.84] I don't care about the Dragon Ball.
[1828.86 → 1829.20] I don't care about the breaking point.
[1829.20 → 1830.52] I'm not that hardcore.
[1830.78 → 1830.96] Oh.
[1831.52 → 1832.88] I put it on Do Not Disturb.
[1833.24 → 1834.28] I'm going to go Skype.
[1834.66 → 1835.54] I did put it on Do Not Disturb.
[1835.54 → 1837.88] Maybe if we were using Racer Come, we wouldn't have this problem.
[1838.10 → 1838.40] That's true.
[1838.40 → 1839.74] I should just use Racer Come for everything.
[1839.80 → 1841.22] Actually, I think we might still have that problem.
[1842.98 → 1843.56] Come on!
[1843.60 → 1844.22] Where's my feather?
[1844.54 → 1845.40] I need my feather!
[1845.40 → 1848.14] How are you supposed to do a jumping level without a feather?
[1851.52 → 1853.06] Someone said something about the Wii U.
[1853.82 → 1855.92] Rumours that the Wii U is going to be overclocked.
[1856.02 → 1857.66] I think it's totally irrelevant.
[1858.34 → 1860.10] Someone's asking about some rumour or something.
[1860.10 → 1860.60] Okay.
[1860.60 → 1864.16] I can't imagine it making any difference whatsoever.
[1864.78 → 1866.32] Because remember, guys, these are consoles.
[1867.70 → 1869.80] The software is made for the hardware.
[1869.94 → 1871.22] The hardware is made for the software.
[1872.16 → 1876.08] It's not like more FPS is going to be better in some way.
[1877.08 → 1878.32] Oh, is there not a...
[1878.32 → 1880.08] Oh, I was trying to stay up in case I...
[1880.08 → 1883.42] Okay, so apparently the way these work is if you get a certain number of coins throughout.
[1883.80 → 1884.30] I heard...
[1884.30 → 1887.50] I saw one person say you have to get 30, and I saw one person say you have to get all of them.
[1888.02 → 1888.44] I don't know.
[1889.22 → 1889.54] Okay.
[1892.06 → 1894.24] Paul said he would join the livestream if he was invited.
[1895.54 → 1897.06] Oh, I just heard back from Corsair.
[1898.88 → 1899.16] Um...
[1899.16 → 1899.48] Oh.
[1901.04 → 1901.40] Ooh.
[1902.10 → 1905.12] Apparently we might be getting K70 and K95 samples soon.
[1905.50 → 1905.80] Two.
[1905.80 → 1909.40] Our contact is placing an order for us to get that going.
[1910.56 → 1912.82] Oh, oh, someone says it's 5 a.m. there.
[1912.90 → 1913.24] Good night.
[1913.42 → 1914.20] Good night, sir.
[1914.50 → 1915.44] You are a trooper.
[1916.06 → 1918.10] I can't believe you stuck with us for so long.
[1918.66 → 1919.50] You are awesome.
[1920.84 → 1921.26] I'm not...
[1921.26 → 1921.50] You know what?
[1921.52 → 1923.26] We have 1,800 live viewers right now.
[1923.44 → 1924.90] Oh, my God.
[1925.32 → 1926.08] Isn't that crazy?
[1926.56 → 1926.86] Are you...
[1926.86 → 1927.88] Wait, is that about the viewers?
[1927.88 → 1929.24] That's about me just dying.
[1929.34 → 1929.70] Oh, it's about me.
[1929.70 → 1932.78] I thought I could make the jump over the flame, but I guess that's not really a thing.
[1933.24 → 1933.74] At least for me.
[1933.76 → 1935.58] Did I not beat this level just last time?
[1936.04 → 1936.60] Did I die?
[1938.10 → 1938.90] Why am I here?
[1939.92 → 1941.10] I don't remember you dying.
[1941.42 → 1942.52] I don't remember dying either.
[1942.86 → 1943.34] What is this?
[1944.80 → 1945.32] Oh, no.
[1945.36 → 1945.90] This is a different level.
[1945.90 → 1946.38] It's not the same level.
[1946.72 → 1946.86] Oh, yeah.
[1947.00 → 1947.64] Oh, dear.
[1948.22 → 1948.90] Oh, hold on.
[1949.00 → 1949.70] I can't get Joshi.
[1950.98 → 1952.30] I need another feather first.
[1952.30 → 1955.70] Oh, because you crushed him if you had Joshi?
[1955.88 → 1956.02] Yep.
[1956.14 → 1956.62] Yeah, okay.
[1959.32 → 1959.76] Don't...
[1959.76 → 1960.18] No!
[1961.18 → 1962.98] I think there might be another Joshi in this.
[1963.14 → 1964.00] Oh, no!
[1966.18 → 1966.58] Wow.
[1967.96 → 1969.38] That was not cool.
[1972.34 → 1973.74] Can I get on one of these...
[1973.74 → 1974.44] Oh, look at that.
[1974.52 → 1974.78] It's back.
[1974.92 → 1975.48] Throw it back up.
[1975.58 → 1975.76] Yeah.
[1976.08 → 1976.92] There's my feather.
[1976.92 → 1979.54] That seems like that was done on purpose.
[1982.38 → 1982.78] Okay.
[1984.78 → 1985.22] Book.
[1985.84 → 1987.14] Let's see how many one-ups I can get.
[1987.78 → 1988.22] Hey, B-roll.
[1988.58 → 1988.86] Hello.
[1988.86 → 1990.52] Are you still here?
[1990.78 → 1990.98] Yeah.
[1992.06 → 1992.74] Um...
[1992.74 → 1993.04] Stop.
[1993.78 → 1994.88] Oh, thank you.
[1995.38 → 1995.82] Um...
[1995.82 → 1999.56] Having an issue with me being encouraged, I'll just wait till the next time it's ready.
[1999.90 → 2000.58] Oh, okay.
[2000.72 → 2000.96] No, no.
[2003.10 → 2003.74] All right.
[2003.82 → 2004.36] Thanks, boss.
[2005.08 → 2006.38] You are the man, by the way.
[2006.78 → 2007.50] You're welcome.
[2011.50 → 2012.18] So elite!
[2012.36 → 2013.04] Oh, no!
[2013.62 → 2015.54] It's a terrible timing to say so elite.
[2015.78 → 2016.48] So elite!
[2016.58 → 2017.34] No, I'm still elite.
[2017.82 → 2018.18] Whatever.
[2018.86 → 2023.02] Part of being elite at Mario is, like, reacting to the bad things that happen.
[2023.14 → 2025.22] It's not all about, like, having nothing bad happen.
[2025.62 → 2025.92] Good point.
[2026.28 → 2026.72] And see?
[2026.84 → 2029.22] Yeah, see, I'm getting that itchiness as well.
[2030.04 → 2030.60] What itchiness?
[2030.94 → 2031.66] Uh, crouching.
[2032.24 → 2032.48] Yeah?
[2032.86 → 2033.62] Yeah, that's annoying.
[2033.66 → 2034.44] There's my Joshi.
[2035.10 → 2038.46] It's all about finishing the level with more power-ups than you started with.
[2038.56 → 2040.04] Did you see that started happening to me again?
[2040.04 → 2042.98] It hasn't been nearly as big of an issue, but I've been...
[2042.98 → 2043.52] Yeah, I saw it.
[2043.52 → 2044.22] ...crouching again.
[2046.74 → 2047.18] Whoops.
[2047.18 → 2049.64] Sorry, Joshi.
[2049.96 → 2052.02] Just ditches Joshi right away, like a jerk.
[2052.02 → 2052.44] Oh, yes.
[2053.74 → 2054.14] Boom.
[2054.90 → 2056.04] Haven't gotten a 50 yet.
[2056.96 → 2059.70] Uh, someone wants to know if I'll ever introduce us to my family.
[2059.70 → 2066.28] Um, actually, in the Corsair Voyager Air video, my baby and my wife are both in it.
[2067.28 → 2069.26] Uh, that's on the Tech Quickie channel.
[2069.48 → 2070.28] Oh, did I get another one?
[2070.48 → 2070.62] Yep.
[2071.06 → 2072.18] Okay, where's my mushroom?
[2072.48 → 2072.98] Right here.
[2074.12 → 2074.54] Boom.
[2074.64 → 2075.08] Right there.
[2075.92 → 2076.28] One.
[2076.76 → 2077.98] Oh, too much delay!
[2078.62 → 2079.54] Oh, no!
[2079.54 → 2080.72] The cape!
[2081.04 → 2081.80] The cape!
[2082.60 → 2084.62] Ah, I got it with the cape almost last time.
[2084.68 → 2085.88] It's easier without the cape, though.
[2085.88 → 2086.06] Yeah.
[2086.24 → 2087.16] Let's see if I can get a couple.
[2087.44 → 2087.86] There we go.
[2089.12 → 2089.44] Ah!
[2090.16 → 2090.48] Disgusting.
[2090.64 → 2091.96] Oh, I'm disgusted with myself.
[2092.04 → 2092.74] That's only one.
[2092.74 → 2098.48] Oh, and my sister's in the Voyager Air one.
[2098.68 → 2099.70] I think my brother's in it, too.
[2099.72 → 2101.04] Oh, no, my brother, my dad's in it.
[2101.66 → 2104.26] My brother was in one of the takes we didn't end up using.
[2104.64 → 2104.88] Oh.
[2106.06 → 2107.44] Go get power-ups first.
[2107.62 → 2107.98] Never mind.
[2108.32 → 2108.54] Oh.
[2108.68 → 2109.62] They're going to run out of lives.
[2110.04 → 2110.30] Oh.
[2111.22 → 2114.26] Someone asked what gaming laptop I'd recommend for a budget of $2,000.
[2114.34 → 2114.58] You know what?
[2114.58 → 2115.52] It's so hard to save.
[2116.14 → 2116.76] Build a desktop.
[2117.14 → 2119.62] Every gaming laptop has so many compromises.
[2119.62 → 2122.92] Buy a cheap Ultrabook and buy a cheap gaming desktop.
[2123.44 → 2123.68] Yep.
[2123.88 → 2124.72] Like, actually.
[2125.34 → 2125.66] Yep.
[2126.42 → 2127.02] You know?
[2128.06 → 2128.46] Right?
[2129.52 → 2129.92] Yep.
[2130.76 → 2131.90] Like, it's just...
[2131.90 → 2133.74] If you're in, like, high school or something anyway...
[2133.74 → 2133.98] Oh.
[2134.30 → 2135.54] If you touch him, you die?
[2135.74 → 2136.00] Oh, yeah.
[2136.18 → 2137.48] Oh, I thought if you just touch the...
[2137.48 → 2138.24] You can bop him.
[2138.98 → 2139.26] Really?
[2139.40 → 2140.76] But he only dies for a little bit.
[2141.34 → 2141.92] Then he comes back.
[2142.08 → 2142.80] Then he comes back.
[2142.86 → 2143.92] I thought I could run through him.
[2143.96 → 2144.52] That's kind of poop.
[2144.86 → 2149.14] Anyway, if you're in high school or whatever, and you're thinking of buying a gaming laptop,
[2149.62 → 2152.96] you'll be happy with yourself if you buy, like, a business-grade laptop and just a gaming
[2152.96 → 2153.88] PC now anyway.
[2154.00 → 2154.90] Because then they'll both...
[2154.90 → 2154.92] Yeah.
[2154.92 → 2155.62] Because you'll use it...
[2155.62 → 2157.48] You'll be able to use that laptop later.
[2157.72 → 2158.00] Yeah.
[2158.22 → 2161.58] And the gaming PC will probably at least be usable for a lot longer.
[2161.86 → 2162.08] Yeah.
[2162.64 → 2165.28] I mean, honestly, so many gaming notebooks have...
[2165.28 → 2165.48] Whoa.
[2166.32 → 2167.68] So many compromises.
[2168.62 → 2171.52] Like, the Asus 14-inch one is really cool.
[2171.52 → 2174.18] But the thing I don't like about it...
[2174.18 → 2174.74] Oh, crap.
[2176.48 → 2177.62] Oh, come on!
[2178.02 → 2181.40] The thing I don't like about it is there's no replaceable battery, which, admittedly,
[2181.44 → 2183.50] I've never replaced a battery in a laptop before.
[2184.04 → 2184.34] I have.
[2185.42 → 2186.64] I mean, cooling's good.
[2187.20 → 2187.62] Oh, shoot.
[2187.70 → 2189.84] I don't really like having a feather here.
[2189.98 → 2190.38] That's okay.
[2192.28 → 2192.64] Shoot.
[2193.86 → 2194.36] That's okay.
[2194.42 → 2195.22] I can get power up later.
[2195.22 → 2198.72] I'll put off.
[2198.96 → 2199.82] It just makes it go back up.
[2201.50 → 2202.16] Yeah, I'm right.
[2203.58 → 2204.92] Yeah, so many compromises.
[2205.06 → 2207.42] And, I mean, the high-end ones are so heavy.
[2207.52 → 2211.40] Like, I have an MSI gaming laptop, which, honestly, I love.
[2211.46 → 2212.62] And I still use...
[2212.62 → 2213.08] Left.
[2213.48 → 2213.68] Pinned.
[2213.92 → 2214.58] We're using it right now.
[2214.68 → 2215.86] I still use a lot of the time.
[2215.90 → 2219.28] We're using it right now because it just has so much more I.O.
[2219.50 → 2222.46] than an Ultrabook, which is great.
[2222.46 → 2223.94] It has so much more power.
[2223.94 → 2227.54] Like, I can actually do rudimentary video editing on it, which is fantastic.
[2228.04 → 2230.64] So, there's something to be said for the whole gaming laptop thing,
[2230.72 → 2232.88] but so many compromises, especially in weight.
[2233.12 → 2236.42] I carried that thing around CES with me a couple of times.
[2236.62 → 2236.78] Brutal.
[2236.88 → 2239.12] It's brutal going anywhere with it.
[2239.26 → 2242.08] I also didn't realize you could just sit on the head.
[2242.62 → 2242.78] Oh.
[2242.78 → 2243.96] But you had to punch into the thing.
[2246.44 → 2246.80] Uh.
[2253.94 → 2257.96] Oh, it counts as a chain as long as you're on the thing?
[2258.14 → 2258.40] Oh, yeah.
[2258.84 → 2261.46] Uh, you have to be on the same side as the baddies.
[2261.64 → 2261.94] Okay.
[2262.58 → 2263.10] But, wait.
[2263.22 → 2263.42] Okay.
[2263.64 → 2268.70] So, the way it counts, because you can punch them, or you can bop them.
[2268.96 → 2269.14] Yeah.
[2269.14 → 2271.70] So, as long as you punch every time or bop every time.
[2271.72 → 2272.38] Or bop every time.
[2272.46 → 2272.56] Okay.
[2272.76 → 2272.78] Yeah.
[2272.82 → 2273.38] Then it's okay.
[2273.74 → 2277.40] So, you can actually switch sides in the castles where you can switch sides.
[2277.46 → 2279.60] As long as you continue doing the same action.
[2279.64 → 2280.60] As long as you do the same thing.
[2280.64 → 2280.80] Okay.
[2281.02 → 2281.16] Yeah.
[2281.94 → 2286.14] Once I actually ran out of time in this castle, because I spent so much time going around in...
[2286.14 → 2287.28] Well, that's awesome.
[2287.40 → 2289.74] Once you get your chain going, you just get a bazillion lives.
[2289.74 → 2294.60] But, we're coming up on Forest of Illusion, which is basically, like, Free Life Central,
[2294.74 → 2295.00] anyway.
[2295.96 → 2298.16] Oh, I kind of wish I had a power-up to fight Ludwig.
[2300.94 → 2301.96] I guess it doesn't really matter.
[2302.28 → 2302.98] I don't think I've died...
[2302.98 → 2304.10] Oh, I'm pinned to the left!
[2304.22 → 2304.58] No!
[2305.58 → 2307.60] I guess it doesn't really matter as long as it's, uh...
[2307.60 → 2309.18] At least you've been pretty lucky with those.
[2310.66 → 2311.26] Aw, crap.
[2311.30 → 2311.56] Oh.
[2311.90 → 2313.04] This is the first time I've died.
[2313.50 → 2313.74] Yep.
[2313.86 → 2314.34] I think so.
[2314.42 → 2315.34] Aw, crap.
[2317.18 → 2317.90] Then there's me.
[2319.74 → 2320.66] Oh, crap.
[2321.50 → 2322.40] I screwed up.
[2322.76 → 2323.60] Guys, tell us.
[2323.68 → 2325.26] I'm looking at Twitch chat right now.
[2325.34 → 2325.82] Oh, I should have gone.
[2325.92 → 2326.46] I got power-ups.
[2326.70 → 2327.80] I'm looking at Twitch chat.
[2327.88 → 2328.18] Tell me.
[2328.42 → 2329.56] What do you think of...
[2329.56 → 2333.58] Oh, Sony FS700 versus Red Scarlet versus Black magic 4K.
[2333.78 → 2336.94] I actually already talked to B-Roll about this, so I don't have to ask him.
[2337.76 → 2341.06] Basically, the new Black magic 4K is really inexpensive.
[2341.44 → 2342.48] It shoots 4K.
[2342.68 → 2344.28] It's really lightweight and small.
[2344.82 → 2346.46] But, it only does 30 FPS.
[2346.46 → 2352.46] So, if you're trying to shoot, like, cinematic stuff, 24 or 30 FPS, the new Black magic is amazing.
[2353.32 → 2356.24] If you want to do slo-mo, buy an FS.
[2356.56 → 2361.06] It's really the only option at that kind of price range.
[2361.06 → 2364.38] The Red Scarlet, on the other hand, is really expensive.
[2364.38 → 2372.04] But the problem is not so much the cost of the camera, but actually more to do with the cost of all the stuff that you need with it in order to shoot red.
[2372.66 → 2375.02] So, lots of challenges.
[2375.56 → 2380.34] The FS, we really felt, was the best in between.
[2380.34 → 2388.94] And, um, when we thought we wrecked our FS when it got wet, we had some internal discussion about if we have to replace it.
[2389.04 → 2389.84] Wait, wait.
[2390.92 → 2391.28] Go.
[2391.96 → 2393.34] If he spawns up there, it's really hard.
[2393.34 → 2400.20] So, we had some internal discussion about what would we get if we, uh, if the FS is dead.
[2400.26 → 2402.58] And we figured, well, we'll just buy an FS again, I guess.
[2403.86 → 2405.10] Someone wants to know how many lives I have.
[2405.14 → 2405.92] I think it's like 57.
[2406.32 → 2406.70] So, yeah.
[2406.74 → 2408.40] Are we any good at live-streaming, you guys?
[2408.52 → 2409.06] Let us know.
[2409.14 → 2411.62] Because, honestly, I've never really watched a live stream before.
[2411.72 → 2414.12] And I've certainly never really done it before beyond this.
[2414.48 → 2416.82] So, I actually don't know if I'm really doing it right.
[2417.68 → 2418.70] Like, is this what you do?
[2419.28 → 2421.38] I, I don't live stream.
[2421.38 → 2422.72] You don't live stream?
[2422.90 → 2423.08] No.
[2423.44 → 2424.68] Well, you do now, apparently.
[2424.98 → 2425.26] I got it.
[2425.28 → 2426.60] You almost died.
[2426.98 → 2428.42] That was so close.
[2429.02 → 2430.96] You just live on the edge, don't you, Slick?
[2431.04 → 2431.38] I do.
[2432.56 → 2433.82] I'd like to live dangerously.
[2433.90 → 2435.96] Someone says, not conventional, but good.
[2437.04 → 2439.56] Is conventional necessarily a good thing?
[2439.58 → 2442.32] We're going to mostly talk text still, I think, anyway.
[2443.36 → 2443.90] But, uh.
[2444.12 → 2446.58] Someone says, you guys are pretty good compared to most streamers.
[2446.66 → 2447.12] Go all the way through.
[2447.18 → 2447.58] Go all the way through.
[2447.64 → 2448.08] You can make it.
[2449.80 → 2450.22] Pop them.
[2450.22 → 2451.56] You can go on that one.
[2451.60 → 2451.86] It's okay.
[2451.96 → 2452.34] Go, go.
[2452.54 → 2453.10] Yeah, you're good.
[2453.42 → 2453.86] Okay, wait.
[2455.46 → 2455.78] Wait.
[2456.98 → 2457.46] Okay, go.
[2459.84 → 2460.56] Mushroom, wait.
[2461.70 → 2462.62] I can hang out down here.
[2462.68 → 2463.20] It's not going to go through.
[2463.52 → 2466.06] Someone says, are the Corsair Vengeance 2000 worth it?
[2466.52 → 2468.36] I'm stuck on that Corsair Survivor.
[2468.36 → 2469.80] Well, those aren't really the same thing.
[2470.16 → 2473.38] The Survivor is a USB drive and the Vengeance is a 2000, or is a headset.
[2473.38 → 2476.76] Honestly, Vengeance 2000s, if you...
[2476.76 → 2477.12] No!
[2481.00 → 2481.96] Vengeance 2000s.
[2481.96 → 2482.82] What do I wait for there?
[2483.00 → 2486.48] You wait for it to go down, and then all the stairs come back up, and you can just walk over.
[2486.94 → 2487.42] Oh, okay.
[2487.94 → 2495.00] Vengeance 2000s are, if you want Dolby headphones, so you want that surround software mixing, then, yeah, there's that.
[2495.00 → 2497.70] Oh, this is a lot harder without a cape.
[2497.86 → 2498.08] Crap.
[2498.24 → 2498.46] Yeah.
[2500.00 → 2500.70] Oh, shoot.
[2501.10 → 2501.94] Died twice now.
[2503.14 → 2503.88] They're comfortable.
[2504.02 → 2504.44] They're lightweight.
[2504.64 → 2505.68] The battery life is decent.
[2505.82 → 2506.66] They sound not bad.
[2506.70 → 2507.28] Have you listened to them?
[2507.48 → 2507.94] No, actually.
[2508.00 → 2508.56] I've never used them.
[2508.86 → 2509.84] Yeah, they're not bad.
[2510.48 → 2511.40] B-roll is going to...
[2511.40 → 2513.96] B-roll, you're going to have to duck by the door if you don't want to be seen.
[2514.10 → 2514.74] Oh, okay.
[2514.82 → 2515.44] Just letting you know.
[2515.70 → 2515.92] Yeah.
[2516.34 → 2516.92] It's up to you.
[2517.12 → 2518.54] Someone says Gelid versus Noctua.
[2518.54 → 2524.66] I use Gelid in my own machine just because looks, but in terms of actual performance and silence
[2524.66 → 2530.02] and undervoting and just how, like, oh, build quality, Noctua's are so nice.
[2531.24 → 2532.46] Like, so nice.
[2533.12 → 2538.10] Someone says the Logitech 930s have tiny drivers and the Vengeance 2000s have single 50mm drivers.
[2538.56 → 2539.80] This much is a fact.
[2539.86 → 2541.44] I have to pee, so you're on.
[2542.92 → 2544.22] Hopefully you can handle...
[2544.22 → 2545.90] I don't even remember what you were talking about.
[2545.90 → 2548.84] Getting power-ups and not dying at the same time.
[2549.92 → 2550.24] Yeah.
[2550.74 → 2551.78] Doesn't that end my turn, though?
[2552.70 → 2553.00] Nope.
[2553.20 → 2553.52] Nope.
[2553.52 → 2554.82] Apparently it doesn't.
[2556.04 → 2559.10] Sorry for my apparent ignorance of Super Mario World.
[2559.88 → 2560.24] Everybody.
[2562.84 → 2565.56] I don't know what he was talking about or else I would try to complete it.
[2565.66 → 2567.18] I know it was something to do with Vengeance 2000.
[2567.80 → 2571.40] I know he said they have 50mm drivers, which as far as I know is the truth.
[2571.76 → 2573.70] Other than that, though, I really have no idea.
[2575.84 → 2576.56] Oh, God.
[2579.02 → 2580.38] I did not mean to do this.
[2580.38 → 2580.42] I did not mean to do this.
[2580.42 → 2584.50] That worked out, I guess.
[2586.30 → 2586.78] Oh, yeah.
[2586.88 → 2590.46] Apparently, like, commercial breaks are a thing in Twitch streams.
[2591.24 → 2591.84] Commercial breaks?
[2591.84 → 2592.02] Yeah.
[2592.06 → 2594.58] You're supposed to just, like, be like, oh, we'll be back in 30 seconds.
[2594.64 → 2595.78] And you run, like, a commercial break?
[2596.36 → 2598.24] I think Day9 does that.
[2598.36 → 2598.46] Yeah.
[2598.46 → 2600.34] But then subscribers don't.
[2601.34 → 2601.90] They don't see it?
[2601.90 → 2603.56] Subscribers just listen to music, I think.
[2603.84 → 2604.14] Okay.
[2604.18 → 2604.72] I think he streams.
[2605.00 → 2605.20] Oh.
[2607.20 → 2607.52] Yeah.
[2607.58 → 2607.84] I don't know.
[2607.88 → 2608.80] Apparently that's a thing, though.
[2609.40 → 2612.20] But I've never really been that good at monetizing content.
[2612.70 → 2613.60] I'm good at sponsors.
[2613.98 → 2617.18] But I'm not perfect at, like, remembering to run ads and stuff.
[2617.18 → 2621.36] Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2622.00 → 2623.36] You can make it, but go fast.
[2623.44 → 2623.76] There you go.
[2624.96 → 2626.72] Someone says, how to reset a BIOS password.
[2626.82 → 2628.68] You'll have to clear the CMOS if you can't remember it.
[2629.10 → 2632.58] So there's usually a button either on the motherboard itself or on the back of the motherboard.
[2633.14 → 2634.60] And then if not, there will be a jumper.
[2634.74 → 2635.38] It'll be in your manual.
[2636.76 → 2638.28] I don't know if we've ever done a guide on that.
[2639.06 → 2640.52] I don't think so either.
[2640.62 → 2641.26] Yeah, I don't think so.
[2641.28 → 2641.94] Maybe we should do that.
[2641.98 → 2642.76] Maybe we should do that, yeah.
[2643.70 → 2645.08] Someone asks what we're playing on.
[2645.26 → 2646.36] And yes, I washed hands.
[2646.68 → 2647.18] See, they're wet.
[2647.54 → 2647.92] Yay.
[2648.52 → 2649.26] I proved it.
[2650.40 → 2650.76] Except.
[2651.88 → 2652.82] Would you lie for me?
[2653.56 → 2654.74] You can kill him when he's down.
[2655.78 → 2656.14] Spin him.
[2657.46 → 2659.38] Yeah, capes are the only way to kill them permanently.
[2661.12 → 2663.02] Someone wants me to talk about cloud gaming.
[2663.22 → 2664.32] I don't think I'm going to do that.
[2664.68 → 2665.70] I do that so many times.
[2665.72 → 2667.48] Yeah, we've talked about cloud gaming a lot.
[2667.48 → 2672.10] Basically, I think it's happening, and it's probably ultimately in the end.
[2672.10 → 2673.84] Not necessarily a terrible thing.
[2673.94 → 2674.70] Slip thinks it's horrible.
[2675.10 → 2675.58] Go all the way through.
[2675.74 → 2676.12] All the way through.
[2677.26 → 2677.76] There you go.
[2677.92 → 2678.38] Spin, spin.
[2678.72 → 2678.92] Spin.
[2680.44 → 2680.76] Jeez.
[2680.94 → 2681.48] Go, go, go.
[2681.52 → 2682.12] Quick, quick, quick.
[2682.78 → 2682.96] Up.
[2683.80 → 2684.12] Wait.
[2684.98 → 2685.30] Down.
[2686.48 → 2687.16] Don't get the mushroom.
[2687.44 → 2687.78] Keep going.
[2688.82 → 2690.22] And then wait on the top step here.
[2691.92 → 2692.40] Just wait.
[2692.46 → 2693.28] It doesn't go to the bottom.
[2693.30 → 2693.56] Oh, I see.
[2693.78 → 2694.06] Okay.
[2695.10 → 2696.46] See, I was like, oh, I have to run.
[2697.46 → 2698.62] HTC1 or Galaxy S4?
[2698.62 → 2702.24] Uh, personally, I've been suggesting the one.
[2702.62 → 2702.94] Me too.
[2703.82 → 2705.28] It's built so well.
[2705.76 → 2706.00] Yeah.
[2706.22 → 2707.62] It's built very, very well.
[2707.76 → 2708.86] It's just so nice.
[2709.84 → 2711.00] Someone says, greetings from Dubai.
[2711.14 → 2712.16] Greetings back, Dubai.
[2714.44 → 2716.04] Um, something, something.
[2716.38 → 2718.72] Someone, uh, someone said something.
[2718.76 → 2718.98] Oh, yeah.
[2719.02 → 2719.62] Someone asked what I thought of the...
[2719.62 → 2719.96] Does this roll all the way down?
[2719.96 → 2720.34] Nope.
[2720.48 → 2720.56] Nope.
[2720.74 → 2722.34] Someone asked what I thought of the 350D.
[2722.44 → 2723.56] Honestly, it looks outstanding.
[2723.88 → 2724.92] I like the huge window.
[2724.96 → 2725.58] Have you seen it yet?
[2725.58 → 2728.78] Uh, glimpses while you guys were working on it.
[2728.84 → 2729.18] Oh, okay.
[2729.24 → 2730.22] Yeah, we unboxed it already.
[2730.36 → 2733.50] But the, uh, the big window's nice in a small case like that.
[2733.82 → 2734.18] Keep going.
[2734.26 → 2734.84] Yeah, you got him.
[2735.18 → 2736.20] Uh, looks very clean.
[2737.10 → 2737.46] Um.
[2739.54 → 2739.86] Yeah.
[2740.08 → 2740.82] Yeah, I really like it.
[2740.84 → 2741.46] That's another feather.
[2741.54 → 2742.08] You're going to want that.
[2743.10 → 2744.02] Uh, this boss.
[2744.18 → 2744.34] Please.
[2744.62 → 2745.74] There's, uh, decoy ones.
[2745.80 → 2746.66] And then there's the real guy.
[2746.84 → 2748.52] And then there's, like, a flame bouncing around.
[2748.60 → 2751.98] So you want to, uh, you have to bop the real guy, or it doesn't count.
[2752.30 → 2752.60] Okay.
[2752.60 → 2755.30] Okay, so avoid the flame.
[2755.80 → 2756.44] And then wait.
[2756.88 → 2757.68] They're gonna pop up.
[2757.98 → 2758.46] Over left.
[2758.86 → 2759.12] Okay.
[2760.44 → 2760.96] There you go.
[2761.00 → 2761.86] You have to have it three times.
[2764.72 → 2765.08] Yep.
[2765.76 → 2766.32] There you go.
[2766.84 → 2767.36] One more.
[2768.06 → 2768.68] You got this.
[2770.06 → 2770.62] Far left.
[2770.70 → 2771.30] You're not going to make it.
[2771.60 → 2772.04] Yeah, you can't.
[2772.10 → 2772.60] Just wait there.
[2772.60 → 2776.94] I didn't, um.
[2777.20 → 2777.58] There you go.
[2777.64 → 2778.00] Oh.
[2779.86 → 2780.32] Far left.
[2780.34 → 2780.84] No, don't go.
[2781.04 → 2781.24] Oh.
[2781.64 → 2782.00] Okay.
[2782.12 → 2782.70] Very nice.
[2783.08 → 2783.40] Yay.
[2783.90 → 2784.92] I wasn't waiting there.
[2785.04 → 2786.36] When I get hit, it, like, stuns me.
[2786.48 → 2787.40] I think that's normal, though.
[2787.66 → 2790.72] Someone says, Linus, any tips for a Bit Phoenix Prodigy water cooling kit?
[2790.84 → 2794.94] Uh, we did a full Bit Phoenix Prodigy liquid cooling guide on NCI Tech Tips.
[2795.44 → 2796.88] So feel free to check it out.
[2797.10 → 2797.52] Pretty Beast.
[2797.52 → 2798.16] Pretty Beast machine, actually.
[2798.16 → 2801.78] I haven't experienced the cracking issue with the Vengeance 2000.
[2802.38 → 2803.26] So I have one.
[2803.56 → 2804.60] I haven't used it a ton.
[2804.86 → 2805.18] Crackling.
[2805.32 → 2806.16] Is it like a...
[2806.16 → 2806.70] Oh, no.
[2806.76 → 2808.24] I think it's the physical cracking issue.
[2808.42 → 2808.58] Sorry.
[2809.08 → 2809.34] Oh.
[2809.68 → 2811.70] Um, ours haven't broken, but I haven't used them a ton.
[2811.78 → 2812.90] Wow, my nose is itchy.
[2813.66 → 2813.96] Oh.
[2814.58 → 2815.24] There we go.
[2815.42 → 2816.64] It's driving me crazy.
[2820.60 → 2822.48] Someone says, Linus is a college dropout.
[2822.62 → 2824.50] Actually, there's a big difference.
[2824.50 → 2826.74] Um, I did not drop out of college.
[2826.94 → 2827.66] I flunked out.
[2828.16 → 2830.74] That's, uh, worse.
[2831.44 → 2832.92] I didn't say it wasn't worse.
[2833.70 → 2834.72] I said it's different.
[2836.52 → 2838.36] I put Skype on, do not disturb.
[2839.94 → 2841.94] Oh, I should have just gone back for power-ups.
[2842.26 → 2843.06] I'm just going to die.
[2845.24 → 2846.54] I'll go superconservative.
[2846.90 → 2848.44] I won't be able to get a bunch of one-ups, though.
[2849.80 → 2850.74] I won't have much time.
[2850.98 → 2852.16] This is a really short castle.
[2853.44 → 2853.80] Yeah.
[2853.80 → 2855.20] Like, time-wise.
[2855.52 → 2856.36] They don't give you a lot of time.
[2856.66 → 2856.86] Yeah.
[2859.18 → 2861.22] I can go get my mushroom, and that'll be good.
[2862.16 → 2863.06] Go get mushroom.
[2863.58 → 2867.26] The one nice thing about being small is you can stand so close to things, and it's just like,
[2867.30 → 2867.58] eh.
[2867.92 → 2868.72] Like that.
[2869.04 → 2869.68] It's like, eh.
[2869.90 → 2870.38] I'm okay.
[2870.38 → 2873.34] I'm not even going to bother with the one-ups up there.
[2875.66 → 2876.06] Mural.
[2876.40 → 2876.76] Whoa!
[2879.64 → 2881.74] That's fine control when I jump in there.
[2883.44 → 2884.60] Does it go past the button?
[2885.36 → 2885.90] I'm sorry?
[2886.06 → 2886.84] Does it go past the button?
[2886.84 → 2887.04] Oh, yeah.
[2887.04 → 2889.40] I don't know how I don't remember any of this.
[2893.48 → 2895.06] Someone asks if I've ever been to Germany.
[2895.18 → 2895.68] I have not.
[2896.44 → 2898.20] I have been to the Netherlands.
[2898.44 → 2899.94] I have been to France.
[2900.28 → 2901.92] I have been to Switzerland.
[2902.56 → 2903.72] I have not been to Germany.
[2903.82 → 2905.26] That was all on one trip with my mom.
[2906.18 → 2913.72] My mom's whole thing is that when we graduated from high school, she'd take us on a trip anywhere.
[2913.72 → 2917.04] So we get a ticket and a place to stay anywhere.
[2917.38 → 2919.86] So I chose Paris, and then we ended up sort of...
[2919.86 → 2921.44] Rocket, shut up!
[2922.54 → 2922.82] Wow!
[2926.78 → 2928.04] Okay, baby, come here.
[2928.42 → 2928.82] Rocket.
[2930.16 → 2930.88] Come here.
[2931.74 → 2932.14] Honey.
[2933.72 → 2934.46] Come here.
[2937.94 → 2939.04] Man, that cat.
[2939.44 → 2941.20] He does it at, like, three in the morning.
[2941.20 → 2944.08] It's like he wants attention.
[2944.20 → 2944.52] He does.
[2944.60 → 2946.96] If I go over there and pet him, he'll be super happy about it.
[2947.62 → 2950.78] But he just doesn't ask nicely, you know?
[2950.80 → 2951.48] You got him this time.
[2952.06 → 2952.34] Oh, yeah.
[2952.56 → 2952.78] Oh, yeah.
[2953.08 → 2953.62] Ludwig's done.
[2956.04 → 2956.64] Oh, crap.
[2957.16 → 2957.54] Go, go.
[2959.00 → 2960.22] I'm assuming he slams.
[2961.22 → 2962.22] But you're just not going to say it.
[2962.28 → 2962.54] All right.
[2964.14 → 2966.80] If you're on the ground, when he touches the ground there, does it stun you?
[2966.94 → 2967.32] Oh, probably.
[2967.42 → 2968.20] Oh, no, it doesn't stun.
[2968.20 → 2973.30] Advanced gameplay mechanics were not a Super Nintendo thing.
[2973.38 → 2973.86] Oh, crap.
[2974.40 → 2975.20] You still got it.
[2978.14 → 2980.76] I have, like, a booger loose in my nose or something.
[2980.86 → 2981.52] That's unfortunate.
[2981.60 → 2982.54] Yeah, it won't come out.
[2983.98 → 2984.76] You want to get that for me?
[2986.94 → 2987.30] Horrible.
[2988.26 → 2990.58] Someone asked, Sandy Bridge E or Ivy Bridge E?
[2990.76 → 2992.00] Well, depends on when you buy it.
[2992.16 → 2994.88] If you buy it now, then Sandy Bridge E will be your only option.
[2994.88 → 2999.26] If you buy it once Ivy Bridge E comes out, then you'll basically be dumb to buy Sandy Bridge E.
[2999.96 → 3000.86] So, there you go.
[3002.96 → 3004.38] Someone says, Linus, what should I get?
[3004.50 → 3005.78] $500 for headphones?
[3006.14 → 3006.52] I don't know.
[3006.58 → 3007.86] Whatever you want, pretty much?
[3008.58 → 3012.48] Honestly, that's outside my price range, so I have very little experience.
[3012.48 → 3025.44] What we found, even comparing something like Sennheiser's HD 555s to 558s, is that the difference in audio quality goes like this, and then really, like, levels off a lot.
[3025.52 → 3031.44] Because even comparing 558s to HD 800s...
[3031.44 → 3032.26] You mean 595?
[3032.60 → 3035.26] Yeah, 595s to HD 800s.
[3035.26 → 3036.28] It's like, yeah, it's better.
[3036.72 → 3038.26] But it's not...
[3038.26 → 3042.98] The thing I liked about the 800s, though, was the like, auditorium on your ear feel.
[3043.80 → 3044.96] Yeah, that was very cool.
[3044.96 → 3047.90] The environmental feel and the environmental sound that you get.
[3048.34 → 3049.16] That was very cool.
[3050.74 → 3053.82] Someone says, apparently, my dad is his math teacher next semester.
[3054.68 → 3054.96] Really?
[3055.88 → 3056.42] That's cool.
[3057.74 → 3058.40] He's pretty cool.
[3059.62 → 3060.90] He helped me fix my car.
[3061.44 → 3064.44] My dad is a math teacher, so I don't totally not believe it.
[3066.14 → 3067.58] Someone says I have a good gaming desktop.
[3067.58 → 3067.86] Oh!
[3068.94 → 3071.64] But I want a gaming laptop for LAN's without playing my desktop.
[3071.64 → 3075.30] I just pressed the wrong button, which made me spin jump off Joshi.
[3075.60 → 3077.78] Joshi jumped off the map, and I jumped off the map.
[3077.94 → 3078.24] Excellent.
[3079.14 → 3080.52] You're my hero, by the way.
[3082.02 → 3084.56] I'm going to come back, because I'm, like, way ahead of you now.
[3084.96 → 3086.20] I'm so used to...
[3086.20 → 3088.60] I'm using an Xbox controller, so A's jump.
[3088.82 → 3089.12] Right.
[3089.34 → 3090.02] In my head.
[3090.20 → 3090.66] It's not.
[3090.94 → 3092.98] Someone asked if the HTC One is heating up.
[3093.26 → 3095.70] Yes, the HTC One does run pretty warm.
[3096.44 → 3100.92] But it doesn't run so warm that it overheats.
[3100.92 → 3106.14] And, if anything, having that nice aluminum backing on there seems to prevent it from throttling,
[3106.50 → 3110.22] from some of the anecdotal sort of evidence that I've encountered.
[3111.20 → 3113.20] So, yeah, it's like a big heat sink.
[3113.20 → 3115.74] And it's not so hot that it's, like, uncomfortable.
[3116.02 → 3116.98] Yeah, like, it's...
[3116.98 → 3117.88] Well, yeah, it's warm.
[3117.94 → 3119.02] It's just noticeably warm.
[3119.24 → 3119.42] Yeah.
[3122.28 → 3123.20] Oh, come on!
[3124.48 → 3125.22] Almost died.
[3126.44 → 3126.72] Meow.
[3129.84 → 3130.20] Wow.
[3130.56 → 3132.54] I'm not going to have time to look for the secret in here.
[3133.46 → 3133.86] Whoa.
[3133.86 → 3137.48] I really can't remember.
[3138.76 → 3139.46] Don't ask me.
[3141.22 → 3141.94] Yeah, I know.
[3143.40 → 3144.12] Oh, hold on.
[3144.16 → 3144.88] That might be a power-up.
[3146.00 → 3148.78] If I recall correctly, there are plenty of power-ups on this level.
[3150.46 → 3151.56] So Linus played League of Legends.
[3152.20 → 3152.94] Oh, yeah, I did.
[3154.08 → 3155.22] I played the lol.
[3155.22 → 3157.56] I played one round.
[3158.24 → 3159.08] I was pretty good.
[3159.64 → 3161.00] I basically carried the team.
[3162.98 → 3164.20] That was so random.
[3164.62 → 3165.22] When it ended...
[3166.48 → 3166.80] What?
[3166.92 → 3167.74] Oh, I had to go.
[3168.64 → 3169.34] No, no, no, no.
[3169.36 → 3170.28] Not when you left.
[3170.46 → 3171.76] Oh, the way the game ended?
[3171.96 → 3172.26] Yeah.
[3172.78 → 3175.62] Like, they just surrendered when it looked pretty even, right?
[3175.80 → 3177.38] It was pretty even, yeah.
[3177.38 → 3182.90] And, like, if they had ever at any point figured out how terrible I was, they would have been able to pick on me pretty hard for...
[3182.90 → 3183.36] Oh, crap!
[3183.36 → 3184.46] They were still picking on you.
[3187.66 → 3189.18] But not, like, enough.
[3189.26 → 3191.12] Because we had people coming down to save you and stuff.
[3192.36 → 3193.18] Oh, there it is.
[3193.18 → 3193.28] Oh!
[3193.72 → 3194.34] Ah, white.
[3194.84 → 3196.42] Do you need those blue blocks?
[3196.50 → 3197.26] They're in a weird spot.
[3198.22 → 3199.14] No, I don't think so.
[3199.62 → 3200.42] Pretty weird spot.
[3200.56 → 3201.22] Why don't they're there for?
[3202.74 → 3204.14] Do you put it on the bouncy thing?
[3204.86 → 3205.62] Oh, crap.
[3205.70 → 3206.34] You might need it.
[3206.34 → 3208.08] I might at least need a feather.
[3208.20 → 3209.20] Oh, do you put...
[3209.20 → 3209.98] Oh, I see.
[3210.44 → 3211.12] That makes sense.
[3212.60 → 3214.00] Yeah, I might need a feather at least.
[3214.08 → 3215.64] Or you can put the bouncy thing on the blue blocks.
[3215.80 → 3218.62] Well, yeah, but we don't get those till the Forest of Illusion, which is where you are.
[3219.12 → 3219.40] Okay.
[3220.66 → 3220.86] Shoot!
[3222.16 → 3224.48] I wonder if there's a feather higher up, and I can come back down.
[3224.90 → 3225.38] That'd be cool.
[3227.42 → 3228.12] I don't remember.
[3230.20 → 3230.56] Whoa!
[3236.34 → 3239.50] Luigi, you span.
[3239.50 → 3242.24] Nothing here.
[3242.24 → 3242.62] Okay.
[3248.62 → 3249.52] Dragon coin?
[3249.64 → 3250.32] Who cares?
[3252.08 → 3252.52] Okay.
[3252.88 → 3253.70] I give up.
[3253.70 → 3262.44] Linus, would you recommend a 120 or 144 hertz monitor?
[3262.60 → 3263.36] Is it really worth it?
[3264.08 → 3265.94] 450 bucks in Sweden for the Asus one.
[3265.98 → 3267.12] Are you really going back for power-ups?
[3267.28 → 3267.40] Yeah.
[3270.22 → 3272.72] People like you are infuriating to play with.
[3272.94 → 3273.20] Why?
[3274.00 → 3275.52] I'm going to do it every single time now.
[3275.70 → 3275.96] Oh!
[3276.26 → 3277.14] You shouldn't have told me that.
[3277.14 → 3281.82] Someone said I meant wireless headphones.
[3282.16 → 3283.68] Yeah, Vengeance 2000 is a good choice.
[3283.84 → 3285.60] There's not that many options for wireless headphones.
[3285.60 → 3286.18] There really isn't.
[3288.18 → 3288.58] Yeah.
[3292.30 → 3293.18] Where was I?
[3293.96 → 3295.06] I don't remember what I was talking about.
[3297.34 → 3298.14] I'm just going to...
[3298.90 → 3300.10] Yeah, I don't remember anymore.
[3300.20 → 3301.48] I'm just going to jump around here for a little bit.
[3301.58 → 3302.24] I'm kind of getting tired.
[3302.48 → 3304.32] Someone asked what my favourite food is.
[3304.32 → 3309.46] It used to be lasagna.
[3309.90 → 3312.94] These days, I'd have to say my wife's curry because it's so good.
[3313.02 → 3313.60] Oh my goodness.
[3314.04 → 3315.10] Like, it's so good.
[3316.00 → 3316.94] My graphics card broke.
[3317.00 → 3318.48] I'm currently using a 260.
[3318.72 → 3323.06] Could you offer any suggestions to upgrade with all the new cards that are out?
[3323.12 → 3324.74] I haven't really been paying attention to new releases.
[3324.86 → 3327.84] If you want something that's sort of similar tier as your 260,
[3329.28 → 3332.16] get like a 660 or a 660 Ti.
[3332.32 → 3333.66] It'll be a significant upgrade for you.
[3334.32 → 3336.96] Oh yeah, I was going to talk about 120 and 140 hertz.
[3337.00 → 3337.86] That's what I did last time.
[3337.88 → 3339.34] Yeah, I told you, don't spin jump.
[3339.40 → 3339.86] No, no, no.
[3340.18 → 3340.78] It's...
[3340.78 → 3341.06] Ah!
[3342.66 → 3348.32] Personally, I prefer the better colour reproduction and better viewing angles of an IPS monitor.
[3352.54 → 3354.58] Joshi can hop on those saws.
[3354.58 → 3355.46] So if you're ever desperate.
[3355.46 → 3355.72] Oh really?
[3355.72 → 3357.32] Yeah, it's good to know.
[3357.32 → 3358.10] That's a beast.
[3358.10 → 3364.56] So I prefer the better colours to the fast response times and fast refresh rates because it's very...
[3364.56 → 3369.52] The colour depth really goes away, and I find it hurts the experience.
[3369.82 → 3377.42] Perfect quality IPS or PLS or even VA monitors are going to deliver a perfect gaming experience.
[3377.42 → 3379.14] It's like Slick's using PA...
[3379.14 → 3379.96] 248s.
[3379.96 → 3380.06] 248s.
[3380.06 → 3380.80] 248s.
[3380.80 → 3381.02] Yeah.
[3381.46 → 3383.14] Which are actually the...
[3383.14 → 3384.14] Um...
[3384.14 → 3385.28] The not as good one.
[3386.28 → 3387.44] It's not a 10-bit panel.
[3387.60 → 3388.52] Yeah, not a 10-bit panel.
[3388.90 → 3390.56] And Diesel the Intern has...
[3390.56 → 3390.80] Oh, no.
[3390.84 → 3392.36] I have a 246.
[3392.52 → 3393.06] Yeah, you have 246.
[3393.06 → 3393.82] So it's an 8-bit panel.
[3393.82 → 3395.12] No, you have 248s.
[3395.86 → 3398.10] And there's no way you ponied up for 246s.
[3398.16 → 3398.70] I don't think you did.
[3398.92 → 3399.44] I don't remember.
[3399.54 → 3400.42] It's a weird...
[3400.42 → 3400.60] Oh!
[3402.92 → 3403.60] That's a thing.
[3403.70 → 3404.16] You have...
[3404.16 → 3408.36] You have 248s, which are not 8-bit panels.
[3408.50 → 3408.70] Okay.
[3408.80 → 3412.46] And then Diesel has an 8-bit panel on his workstation, the 246.
[3412.70 → 3413.68] PA246.
[3414.04 → 3414.60] You can fly.
[3414.70 → 3414.88] What?
[3415.00 → 3415.42] B, B, B.
[3415.60 → 3416.10] Fly, fly, fly.
[3416.10 → 3416.22] Okay.
[3416.78 → 3417.26] Um...
[3417.26 → 3418.86] So, so yeah.
[3418.94 → 3423.80] So Diesel's workstation and Slick's computer both have reasonably good payments.
[3423.82 → 3424.68] Pixel response times.
[3424.78 → 3425.78] Not too much motion blur.
[3426.28 → 3427.70] Great gaming experience.
[3428.90 → 3431.62] But, um, great colour depth.
[3431.88 → 3433.88] Very, just, oh, it looks so good.
[3434.38 → 3436.90] Joshi can bop those, so you don't have to worry about hitting them from the top.
[3437.00 → 3437.22] Okay.
[3438.12 → 3439.64] This is messed.
[3439.86 → 3440.82] I've never done this before.
[3441.56 → 3443.12] If you make it, I'll be pretty impressed.
[3444.46 → 3448.00] I mean, you haven't gotten any of the dragon coins, which is sort of the point of this, but...
[3448.00 → 3449.36] I thought we didn't care about dragon coins.
[3449.48 → 3449.88] I don't.
[3450.28 → 3451.18] Oh, okay.
[3452.02 → 3452.86] I thought we were just...
[3452.86 → 3455.22] I think you get to keep blue Joshi if you get to the end.
[3455.58 → 3456.20] I'm not sure, though.
[3456.26 → 3456.68] That'd be pretty good.
[3456.68 → 3456.86] Go down.
[3457.64 → 3457.90] Oh.
[3459.92 → 3462.48] See, last time I assumed that I just jumped off something, I died.
[3462.96 → 3465.78] So I was not stoked for that.
[3465.88 → 3467.02] Well, you beat the level at any rate.
[3467.40 → 3467.64] Yay.
[3467.84 → 3468.32] You know what?
[3468.36 → 3469.92] I'm gonna just be a butthead.
[3470.02 → 3470.70] I'm going to do it too.
[3470.70 → 3471.28] I'm...
[3471.28 → 3471.74] Oh, okay.
[3472.52 → 3473.88] I hate people that do that.
[3474.26 → 3476.84] Well, I specifically need a cape for this level.
[3476.84 → 3478.60] There's only one there.
[3478.78 → 3482.12] If I get hit again, my left arrow's not working out at all.
[3482.12 → 3483.22] I don't care at all.
[3483.36 → 3484.32] Can't wait for...
[3484.32 → 3485.50] This controller's so old.
[3485.50 → 3486.40] That sucks, yeah.
[3487.06 → 3487.54] It's ancient.
[3487.54 → 3489.76] Not like our SNES controllers aren't going to be old.
[3489.92 → 3490.78] Yeah, but they work.
[3490.88 → 3491.46] Yeah, no, I know.
[3491.66 → 3491.76] I know.
[3491.76 → 3492.80] Oh, did you see it?
[3492.80 → 3494.90] Just like, take me flying off the screen there?
[3494.98 → 3495.24] Yeah.
[3495.42 → 3495.58] Yeah.
[3495.58 → 3496.12] Is it still going?
[3496.40 → 3496.84] I don't know.
[3497.48 → 3498.18] Guess we'll find out.
[3498.36 → 3499.46] Yeah, that's so crappy.
[3501.40 → 3502.12] It's an amazing idea.
[3502.12 → 3503.18] Oh, tell me the book.
[3503.20 → 3504.12] Come on!
[3505.28 → 3506.14] No, it doesn't help.
[3506.20 → 3506.80] It's the controller.
[3507.00 → 3507.26] Oh, okay.
[3507.34 → 3507.94] I don't think that is...
[3507.94 → 3509.54] But you can mash it while I do that.
[3509.98 → 3510.72] It shouldn't do anything.
[3511.42 → 3511.82] Oh, okay.
[3512.94 → 3513.52] Sorry, what'd you say?
[3513.54 → 3515.10] Did you tell them about the converters that you got?
[3515.88 → 3516.28] Yeah.
[3516.44 → 3516.98] Yeah, I already did.
[3517.10 → 3517.28] Okay.
[3517.44 → 3519.44] Oh, and we got a Racer...
[3519.44 → 3521.18] Oh, crap.
[3521.26 → 3521.78] Not the blade.
[3522.84 → 3523.78] What's the tablet called?
[3523.86 → 3524.08] Edge.
[3524.10 → 3525.00] We got a Racer Edge.
[3525.58 → 3528.04] So, guys, we're going to be doing a video about the Racer Edge soon.
[3528.10 → 3529.74] I'm going to be spending some time with it this weekend.
[3529.84 → 3531.26] I'm super excited about that.
[3531.96 → 3534.48] So, that's the gaming-grade tablet from Racer.
[3534.80 → 3537.80] It's really exciting, some of the stuff that they're doing on the system side.
[3537.80 → 3543.98] Because, I mean, say whatever you want about sort of the original blade particularly,
[3544.26 → 3546.86] where it wasn't perfect by any stretch.
[3547.66 → 3549.92] But the second-gen one was kind of awesome.
[3549.92 → 3556.42] And, you know, say whatever you want about the first-gen Edge.
[3557.14 → 3559.10] But, like, they are innovating.
[3559.78 → 3560.88] They're innovating in a...
[3560.88 → 3562.60] Come on, I'm pinned to the left.
[3562.66 → 3562.92] I can't.
[3562.92 → 3563.54] You deserve it.
[3563.68 → 3564.34] You ditched Joshi.
[3565.20 → 3565.94] Oh, okay.
[3566.72 → 3569.14] I mean, say whatever you want about...
[3569.14 → 3570.08] Oh, you're going to want a duck.
[3570.48 → 3570.98] Who is that?
[3571.60 → 3571.98] It's me.
[3572.30 → 3572.72] Oh, okay.
[3572.74 → 3572.90] Hi.
[3572.90 → 3574.36] Your side paddle is pulling my card.
[3574.92 → 3575.70] Oh, thank you.
[3575.88 → 3576.08] Yeah.
[3577.42 → 3579.30] Say whatever you want about the first-gen ones.
[3579.44 → 3580.18] You know, they're not perfect.
[3580.34 → 3582.82] But think of an Edge with Haswell.
[3583.64 → 3584.04] Yeah.
[3584.64 → 3588.20] Like, the way Haswell is shaping up in terms of power consumption.
[3588.38 → 3588.58] Yep.
[3589.14 → 3589.94] Like, oh, man.
[3590.16 → 3591.02] Oh, my goodness.
[3591.16 → 3594.72] It is going to be really hard for me to keep playing like this if it keeps being this bad.
[3597.26 → 3597.96] So, yeah.
[3598.76 → 3599.60] Incredibly exciting.
[3600.88 → 3601.64] Incredibly exciting.
[3601.64 → 3610.12] And it's really cool to see someone doing like what Apple's doing in terms of build quality and industrial design on the PC side.
[3610.36 → 3616.04] We should be acknowledging what Racer's doing and, like, giving them the old thumbs up because it's really cool.
[3620.54 → 3621.24] So, yeah.
[3621.32 → 3622.62] I'm excited to check it out.
[3623.08 → 3626.54] What I recall from CES is that it does run a little warm.
[3627.12 → 3628.48] It isn't really super lightweight.
[3628.88 → 3629.30] But...
[3629.30 → 3630.36] You're up.
[3630.36 → 3634.32] It was legitimately running games, which most tablets won't do.
[3634.96 → 3635.36] So...
[3635.36 → 3636.76] So what's going on now?
[3637.56 → 3638.94] You have to beat levels.
[3639.18 → 3641.52] You've got to stop pressing that button.
[3641.52 → 3644.52] No, how do I, uh...
[3644.52 → 3646.74] What?
[3647.10 → 3647.98] So he's just purple.
[3648.16 → 3648.30] Oh, yeah.
[3648.36 → 3649.10] He's blue.
[3649.34 → 3650.30] If you...
[3650.30 → 3653.02] Stop pressing A!
[3653.68 → 3653.96] Go!
[3655.24 → 3657.34] If you eat any shell, you'll fly.
[3657.92 → 3658.58] Oh, that's cool.
[3660.16 → 3661.42] You're going to want to get out of there.
[3661.92 → 3662.28] Whoa.
[3663.20 → 3663.74] Don't do it.
[3663.74 → 3664.64] Go hit him.
[3664.86 → 3665.56] Okay, too late.
[3666.04 → 3667.26] Go hit him fast this time.
[3668.74 → 3669.36] There you go.
[3670.20 → 3670.34] Yeah, you're...
[3670.34 → 3670.62] No!
[3671.20 → 3671.48] No!
[3673.14 → 3673.54] Oh!
[3674.64 → 3675.04] Uh...
[3675.04 → 3677.12] Z10 switch update should be coming pretty soon.
[3677.16 → 3678.28] Are you around this weekend or no?
[3679.34 → 3679.82] Uh...
[3679.82 → 3680.46] Maybe Sunday.
[3680.70 → 3685.56] Okay, so maybe we'll film one this weekend and then, uh...
[3685.56 → 3686.14] Um...
[3686.14 → 3688.04] That'll be a day seven, I guess, by that time.
[3688.60 → 3688.78] Yeah.
[3688.80 → 3690.30] Because we filmed day one last weekend.
[3691.56 → 3691.88] Uh...
[3691.88 → 3693.26] Slit's got lots of notes about it.
[3693.26 → 3694.62] You can spin those, guys, with the cape.
[3695.24 → 3695.52] Yeah.
[3695.66 → 3695.76] Okay.
[3695.76 → 3699.12] So yeah, Slit's got lots of notes about it, so it actually should be a perfect update.
[3699.74 → 3700.14] Uh...
[3700.14 → 3701.66] You left your file back there.
[3701.68 → 3701.98] It's gone.
[3703.10 → 3704.00] And it's gone!
[3705.86 → 3708.92] We have 1775 viewers already.
[3709.34 → 3710.14] Watching me fail.
[3710.14 → 3712.22] Watching you fail at Super Mario Bros.
[3713.38 → 3714.44] Or Super Mario World.
[3714.62 → 3715.32] Super Mario World.
[3715.48 → 3717.12] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[3717.78 → 3718.72] Is there anything in these?
[3718.72 → 3719.66] I think so.
[3720.80 → 3721.52] Yeah, there's something.
[3723.54 → 3723.98] Damn it.
[3724.56 → 3725.56] What a power up.
[3726.26 → 3726.62] Yay!
[3726.72 → 3727.34] Oh, is that it?
[3727.34 → 3728.50] There might be something over there.
[3728.78 → 3729.20] You should check.
[3729.88 → 3730.84] I think you can make that jump.
[3731.56 → 3732.46] If you have the skills.
[3733.70 → 3734.36] Oh, wow.
[3734.52 → 3735.40] I can't go...
[3735.40 → 3736.22] Okay, don't worry about it.
[3736.50 → 3738.60] If you have the skills to pay the bills, you can make that jump.
[3738.60 → 3740.46] How long has it been since anyone said that to you?
[3740.46 → 3741.38] You're going to run out of time.
[3742.02 → 3743.00] Time is your enemy.
[3743.78 → 3745.04] I almost did a spin jump.
[3745.76 → 3746.32] Would you have raged?
[3746.78 → 3747.40] Would you have raged?
[3747.48 → 3748.88] I would have raged so hard.
[3749.26 → 3751.56] It's so nice playing this on a CRT.
[3752.26 → 3752.96] What is this?
[3752.96 → 3754.64] What?
[3755.02 → 3755.46] What do I do?
[3755.56 → 3756.46] Oh, go left.
[3757.02 → 3757.42] What?
[3758.18 → 3759.50] And beware the puffer fish.
[3759.56 → 3760.20] You're going to die.
[3762.02 → 3762.72] You're going to die.
[3763.66 → 3764.18] I do.
[3764.24 → 3764.90] Go fast.
[3766.34 → 3767.14] Jump over him.
[3767.24 → 3767.60] Or under.
[3767.84 → 3769.52] Oh, innovative strategy, sir.
[3769.82 → 3770.16] Yeah.
[3772.96 → 3774.24] That was so sketch.
[3774.60 → 3775.02] Do this fall?
[3775.08 → 3775.46] Do this fall?
[3775.88 → 3776.18] Ah!
[3776.48 → 3776.76] No.
[3777.02 → 3777.30] Okay.
[3778.30 → 3779.38] Oh, get it, get it.
[3780.18 → 3780.80] Okay, keep going.
[3780.86 → 3782.28] You've actually gone backwards in the level.
[3782.28 → 3783.48] Oh, no!
[3785.82 → 3787.08] No way.
[3788.50 → 3790.94] Someone says they're waiting on a quad config of Titans.
[3791.06 → 3792.26] Nearly got enough to order them.
[3792.62 → 3795.88] The best advice I can give you, man, is do not order them.
[3796.14 → 3796.34] Yeah.
[3796.86 → 3797.94] Sorry, but don't.
[3798.04 → 3798.60] Get two.
[3799.26 → 3802.46] Get two and treat yourself to, like, a 4K monitor or something.
[3803.50 → 3806.74] Like, enhance your gaming experience in some other way,
[3806.82 → 3809.28] because quad SLI is not the answer.
[3809.54 → 3811.36] Unless he's doing something other than gaming.
[3811.36 → 3814.66] Yeah, unless it's for, like, computer programming or something.
[3814.66 → 3817.12] Unless it's for something else, but, like, dude,
[3817.30 → 3819.54] like, you're not actually going to feel the increase there.
[3819.64 → 3820.14] Sorry, man.
[3820.30 → 3820.48] Yeah.
[3820.48 → 3825.64] And even Nvidia has some micro stuttering with huge multi-way configurations.
[3825.64 → 3826.10] Yeah.
[3826.10 → 3826.58] Yeah.
[3826.76 → 3827.14] Yeah.
[3827.14 → 3834.60] This is how I show off my mad skills.
[3834.60 → 3840.82] I wish life really worked that way.
[3841.16 → 3841.74] Yeah, I know, right?
[3842.08 → 3842.40] Physics?
[3842.62 → 3843.02] Just...
[3843.02 → 3844.18] I'm going to go to work.
[3844.46 → 3844.60] Yeah.
[3844.82 → 3845.48] Perpetual motion.
[3846.06 → 3846.76] Don't worry about it.
[3847.02 → 3848.34] You know if you had thermals, it would work.
[3849.66 → 3850.64] That's how eagles soar.
[3852.10 → 3852.72] No, really!
[3852.72 → 3853.46] Yeah, I know, I know.
[3854.86 → 3856.02] You don't want thermals.
[3858.18 → 3859.82] Yeah, no, it's...
[3859.82 → 3861.42] Do you know the secret on the bridge down there?
[3861.58 → 3861.88] No.
[3862.04 → 3863.22] Oh, okay, I'll go do it after.
[3863.62 → 3863.92] Okay.
[3865.92 → 3867.02] Do you know the secret?
[3867.02 → 3869.36] Someone asks if that's an Emery shirt.
[3870.18 → 3870.40] What?
[3871.26 → 3871.66] Emery?
[3872.16 → 3872.84] I don't think so.
[3873.04 → 3873.24] No.
[3873.36 → 3873.54] Okay.
[3873.82 → 3874.44] He doesn't know.
[3874.56 → 3875.44] I got it in, like, grade 8.
[3875.88 → 3876.72] So...
[3876.72 → 3878.28] Someone says, what's the deal with delisting?
[3878.42 → 3880.66] Would it help tamp some of my 3570K with an H100?
[3881.06 → 3882.92] Honestly, it's probably not worth it.
[3884.60 → 3885.72] 3570K, that would make a difference.
[3885.90 → 3889.34] It would make a difference, but he's going to have to modify the hold-down bracket on his
[3889.34 → 3889.74] motherboard.
[3891.76 → 3896.62] He's going to have to make sure that his H100i makes correct contact because the screws are
[3896.62 → 3898.68] tuned for having an IHS.
[3899.28 → 3899.42] Yep.
[3899.52 → 3903.96] Like, it's one of those things where if you're running, like, custom liquid cooling and you
[3903.96 → 3908.12] want to get every last drop of performance out of it, go for it.
[3908.24 → 3911.30] If you have a particularly bad CPU, go for it.
[3911.54 → 3915.14] But it's not something that I really recommend, like, everyone run out and do.
[3915.60 → 3916.86] Can you swallow the big dudes?
[3917.94 → 3919.26] Someone says pepperoni or ham and cheese.
[3919.32 → 3919.72] Yes, you can.
[3919.96 → 3921.24] And you've got to stop pressing that.
[3921.24 → 3921.68] James!
[3923.34 → 3924.50] Ham and cheese for me.
[3924.50 → 3927.04] Although what I really like is bacon and pineapple.
[3928.22 → 3932.16] Or grilled chicken and raw tomato.
[3932.48 → 3933.94] Like, cooked tomato, but not dried tomato.
[3934.62 → 3935.22] Just go across.
[3935.86 → 3936.96] You don't need that for anything.
[3939.36 → 3940.80] Pepperoni, bacon, chicken.
[3941.26 → 3941.84] Oh, God.
[3941.92 → 3943.20] What are you doing?
[3945.18 → 3946.72] Now I think you're just doing it on purpose.
[3946.74 → 3947.40] I'm not!
[3947.40 → 3949.64] Okay, bop it, and then you've got to jump across to get it.
[3949.64 → 3953.36] Yeah, you've got to hit it on the third one.
[3956.58 → 3957.92] Now, go get it.
[3958.56 → 3959.00] There you go.
[3959.46 → 3961.00] Uh, pepperoni, bacon, chicken.
[3961.00 → 3961.68] Three of them coming up.
[3961.76 → 3962.90] Eat the second one and the third one.
[3963.14 → 3963.46] There you go.
[3964.40 → 3965.34] Pepperoni, bacon, chicken?
[3965.98 → 3969.36] Pepperoni, bacon, chicken, jalapeño white sauce, green peppers, and red onions.
[3969.78 → 3970.50] That's expensive.
[3970.76 → 3971.54] I'm too cheap for that.
[3971.54 → 3975.76] Okay, you want a star, so you've got to hit it when it's a feather, and you've got to get it right away.
[3977.08 → 3978.14] Not a case, I'm going to get it right away.
[3979.64 → 3981.92] You have to get it, like, before it even goes.
[3982.22 → 3983.42] Yeah, you've got it pretty quick.
[3985.34 → 3986.58] Those aren't blocks.
[3987.20 → 3988.60] No, you can't get all the free locks here.
[3990.06 → 3992.40] Someone asked, what are the specs of the first PC I built?
[3992.40 → 3995.18] I had a Barton 2500K.
[3995.76 → 4001.60] I had 512 legs of Samsung DDR2.
[4001.84 → 4003.32] Or, uh, Samsung DDR.
[4003.50 → 4004.22] It was, like, OEM.
[4005.86 → 4007.46] Um, generic DDR.
[4007.80 → 4008.60] Samsung brand.
[4009.46 → 4016.52] Um, I got myself a Sol tech MRN2L, which was the onboard graphics version of the FRN2L.
[4016.58 → 4016.90] Get that?
[4017.38 → 4017.90] Get it?
[4018.00 → 4018.54] And then go left.
[4018.62 → 4018.90] Go left.
[4018.98 → 4019.50] Left down.
[4019.58 → 4019.98] Left down.
[4020.08 → 4020.76] Okay, it's way too late.
[4020.92 → 4021.26] What?
[4021.34 → 4022.08] Left and down.
[4022.08 → 4023.08] See if you can make it.
[4023.40 → 4023.56] What?
[4023.76 → 4024.28] Well, not now.
[4024.30 → 4024.84] Too late.
[4025.00 → 4025.58] Okay, go forward.
[4026.56 → 4032.10] Um, I had an 80 gig with 8 Meg cash.
[4033.06 → 4034.32] Max store, Diamond Max.
[4034.64 → 4036.68] Ew, I don't remember what Diamond Max it was.
[4036.70 → 4036.96] Oh, God.
[4037.50 → 4038.42] It's okay, you can get your mushroom.
[4038.50 → 4039.18] You can still make this.
[4040.42 → 4045.28] Um, and it was either that one or it was the 120 gig with 2 legs of cash.
[4045.74 → 4046.66] You've got to bop them from the bottom.
[4048.54 → 4051.48] And, uh, you're going to want to go back up on that tube so you can get on it.
[4052.08 → 4055.66] Um, what else did I have?
[4055.72 → 4056.86] I didn't have a video card.
[4056.90 → 4061.48] I was using onboard GeForce 4 MX because I thought that GeForce meant good.
[4062.48 → 4063.70] Oh, cool.
[4063.70 → 4067.70] You're going to try and get it at the very bottom?
[4067.82 → 4068.10] Oh, okay.
[4068.98 → 4069.68] Uh, what else do I have?
[4069.70 → 4071.08] That doesn't give you anything good.
[4071.12 → 4072.86] I had an Aztec Land boy with Smart Blue.
[4073.00 → 4073.70] No, it doesn't do anything.
[4073.76 → 4074.08] Yeah, I didn't.
[4074.60 → 4076.02] Aztec Land boy with Smart Blue.
[4076.02 → 4080.82] I had, um, I can't remember what all the specs are.
[4081.06 → 4082.46] Got myself a CD router.
[4083.34 → 4083.78] Yeah.
[4083.94 → 4085.82] I mean, this isn't the first computer I owned.
[4085.92 → 4089.92] The first computer that was mine was, oh, nope.
[4090.24 → 4090.54] Too late.
[4090.96 → 4095.40] Uh, the first computer that was mine was a Pentium 166 that I inherited from my uncle.
[4095.44 → 4097.64] And I played myself some Soul Reader on that thing.
[4097.68 → 4097.86] Oh.
[4097.86 → 4098.64] Very nice.
[4098.74 → 4099.00] Almost.
[4106.52 → 4111.90] Anyway, the way I learned to build my first computer, that one, was I watched a buddy that
[4111.90 → 4114.78] I went to on an exchange to Quebec with.
[4115.76 → 4118.50] And, uh, I basically had him help me pick all the stuff.
[4119.66 → 4123.30] And he, um, built it for me.
[4123.58 → 4126.08] And then I promptly, oh, the left.
[4126.58 → 4127.22] The left.
[4127.22 → 4130.50] And then I promptly went home and rebuilt the computer myself.
[4131.16 → 4134.76] So I took it all apart and rebuilt it again after having just watched him build it.
[4135.02 → 4136.68] And that was how I learned to build my first computer.
[4136.84 → 4137.48] That's a good way to do it.
[4137.86 → 4138.12] Yeah.
[4138.48 → 4139.56] It worked out pretty unwell.
[4139.76 → 4142.64] My dad gave me this old broken computer and was like, here, figure it out.
[4143.48 → 4147.22] So I just, like, tore the thing apart and learned about different parts.
[4148.26 → 4148.94] Very nice.
[4150.18 → 4151.54] I need a new game controller.
[4151.86 → 4152.34] Yeah, you do.
[4152.54 → 4154.80] How have we never gotten any samples of game controllers?
[4154.80 → 4158.56] Well, we kind of did, but it doesn't really count.
[4158.62 → 4160.34] Yeah, we got the Steel Series free, but it's Bluetooth.
[4160.56 → 4161.76] It's not really optimal for...
[4161.76 → 4163.14] Oh, wow.
[4164.36 → 4165.36] Oh, nice.
[4165.54 → 4166.20] Oh, nice.
[4166.62 → 4168.16] I thought this is a feather again.
[4168.20 → 4168.46] Something.
[4168.68 → 4169.12] There you go.
[4169.12 → 4172.24] Oh, oh, oh.
[4172.56 → 4172.92] Nice.
[4174.92 → 4175.28] Yeah.
[4175.54 → 4176.08] Yeah, I don't know.
[4176.42 → 4176.80] Not so much.
[4176.88 → 4178.18] And my hands would be like...
[4178.18 → 4180.56] Yeah, the free's a little small for you, especially you.
[4181.78 → 4185.06] It's a little bit better than actually using a touchscreen, but it doesn't work in the game.
[4185.06 → 4185.86] I should go on Logitech.
[4185.88 → 4186.70] In, like, the only game I ever heard.
[4186.70 → 4188.54] See if they'll, like, sponsor our livestream.
[4189.04 → 4189.52] You know what's funny?
[4189.52 → 4193.12] So many people ask me how to get sponsors on, like...
[4193.12 → 4195.14] We're terrible at that, so...
[4195.14 → 4196.48] We're terrible at it, for one thing.
[4196.54 → 4199.48] And the other thing is you have to actually have viewers first.
[4199.86 → 4202.82] No one's going to sponsor you just to be, like...
[4202.82 → 4203.14] Yeah.
[4203.60 → 4210.24] ...your sponsor because you featured them on your, like, game streaming channel that gets, like, four views.
[4210.30 → 4212.22] And I mean, I'm not meaning to be discouraging or anything.
[4212.30 → 4213.22] It just is what it is.
[4213.22 → 4216.88] If you were a sponsor, would you sponsor that guy?
[4217.08 → 4219.86] Or would you try to sponsor, I don't know, like, PewDiePie or something?
[4219.96 → 4223.12] I've had a lot of people ask how they get sponsors for computer builds.
[4223.52 → 4224.60] That's probably even harder.
[4225.12 → 4226.20] That's really hard.
[4226.32 → 4226.82] And...
[4226.82 → 4227.86] So competitive.
[4228.02 → 4231.44] You're going to have to be super beast to be able to actually get it.
[4231.56 → 4232.00] Oh, crap!
[4233.26 → 4234.90] I think I screwed this up.
[4235.00 → 4235.22] Screwed.
[4235.24 → 4236.04] What are you trying to do?
[4237.08 → 4237.56] Secret?
[4237.74 → 4238.44] I need Joshi.
[4239.70 → 4240.64] Are you trying to get a secret?
[4241.00 → 4241.36] Yeah.
[4241.36 → 4243.22] You have to go under.
[4243.92 → 4244.16] Oh.
[4244.96 → 4246.08] So if I can...
[4246.08 → 4247.72] Wait, how do you get Joshi through this level?
[4248.40 → 4249.26] How do you get this?
[4249.32 → 4250.02] I guess you can fly.
[4250.02 → 4251.80] You can platform the whole way, couldn't you?
[4253.14 → 4254.56] Oh, no, because the ropes.
[4254.74 → 4255.62] Oh, you have the ropes at the end.
[4255.66 → 4256.90] I can't remember how to do this.
[4257.84 → 4258.58] Yeah, you have to...
[4258.58 → 4259.84] Okay, apparently you have to fly under.
[4260.98 → 4262.90] Can I get that far enough to fly?
[4262.90 → 4264.18] Oh, that's unfortunate.
[4265.58 → 4265.94] Okay.
[4266.44 → 4266.86] You're up.
[4267.08 → 4268.06] Does that not take a life?
[4268.78 → 4270.64] No, I exited before I died.
[4270.64 → 4271.54] That's hacks.
[4272.62 → 4273.02] Wow.
[4273.16 → 4274.92] You can only do it on levels that you've already beat, though.
[4275.38 → 4275.76] Oh, okay.
[4275.82 → 4276.38] That's not that hacks.
[4277.12 → 4278.10] What is this?
[4280.86 → 4282.20] Stupid underwater ones.
[4282.88 → 4283.36] Oh, yeah.
[4283.44 → 4286.02] You can use the rope to drop, then jump under.
[4290.02 → 4290.38] Sure.
[4291.30 → 4292.22] Can I kill this guy?
[4292.22 → 4294.50] Uh, no.
[4295.44 → 4296.36] That's so unfortunate.
[4297.10 → 4298.26] Yeah, I hate this secret.
[4298.36 → 4301.64] I'm going to have to go back and get myself a couple capes and take another crack at it.
[4303.34 → 4304.68] Someone asks what car I have.
[4304.78 → 4307.44] I drive a 2003 Honda Civic Super Civic.
[4308.74 → 4309.06] Super mobile.
[4309.48 → 4310.32] Well, and...
[4310.32 → 4311.14] Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[4312.04 → 4313.48] That was a terrible idea.
[4313.58 → 4314.80] I should not have listened to you.
[4316.48 → 4317.06] Oh, God.
[4317.20 → 4318.06] You go so slow.
[4318.06 → 4320.30] Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[4320.30 → 4324.32] Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[4324.42 → 4325.92] Someone asked if I speak French.
[4326.32 → 4327.54] Used to speak a little French.
[4327.64 → 4328.32] Not so much anymore.
[4329.00 → 4330.02] You speak more than I do.
[4330.36 → 4331.28] Yeah, I speak more than you do.
[4336.22 → 4336.74] Get that.
[4336.78 → 4337.10] That's good.
[4338.36 → 4338.78] Relay.
[4342.48 → 4343.86] I'm, like, sleepy now.
[4344.36 → 4345.20] I'm actually exhausted.
[4345.20 → 4345.48] Wait, no.
[4345.48 → 4345.82] Go left.
[4345.90 → 4346.24] Go left.
[4347.82 → 4348.72] Go left and go down.
[4348.72 → 4355.72] I can't remember if it's here or not but feel that guy. No it's not here yet. Keep going.
[4355.72 → 4363.72] Can I ride above him? No. Oh, I'll just wait. I wouldn't. Crap I might have taken you the wrong way.
[4363.72 → 4375.72] Let it fall! Awesome! Someone asked 4 GHz pile driver or wait for steamroller.
[4375.72 → 4382.72] Wait. I can't remember.
[4382.72 → 4387.72] It was bulldozer pile driver steamroller. Yeah, that's right.
[4387.72 → 4393.72] Wow I don't know if there's any real news on AMD's next architecture when it's coming out.
[4393.72 → 4398.72] It's not something I'd recommend waiting for. You're going to go left at some point though.
[4398.72 → 4403.72] Am I? Yeah, down. Yeah, no trust me.
[4403.72 → 4407.72] Like down? Yeah, like down.
[4407.72 → 4410.72] Cause the secret exit is somewhere down there.
[4410.72 → 4415.72] Nope. Oh, wait. Yeah, go left. I think it's over here.
[4415.72 → 4421.72] No? Really? No go right. Go right. Go up and right.
[4421.72 → 4424.72] Don't worry you're not far now.
[4424.72 → 4426.72] Ah.
[4426.72 → 4434.72] Ah yes okay so once you go through here then you go down and then left.
[4434.72 → 4436.72] You got time don't worry don't rush.
[4436.72 → 4438.72] I'm not really rushing. That was all crazy.
[4438.72 → 4440.72] Can you tell that you're almost out of time?
[4440.72 → 4442.72] I can hear the music. Left left left. Go go go.
[4442.72 → 4444.72] Nope don't worry about it.
[4444.72 → 4446.72] Boy can't. Ohhhh.
[4446.72 → 4450.72] Can't get the key and carry the door.
[4450.72 → 4452.72] There you go.
[4452.72 → 4454.72] Oh man.
[4454.72 → 4456.72] Someone says hey Linus can I trust refurbished SSDs?
[4456.72 → 4458.72] I'm running eight of them in raid 0.
[4458.72 → 4460.72] And they're doing pretty good.
[4460.72 → 4462.72] And they've been doing it for a while.
[4462.72 → 4464.72] I'm not a heavy user on them though.
[4464.72 → 4466.72] That's true. But gamers aren't heavy users on them either.
[4466.72 → 4471.72] That's true. I mean people who are sitting there worried about the longevity of SSDs guys.
[4471.72 → 4473.72] If you're not using it as like a scratch disk.
[4473.72 → 4474.72] Yeah.
[4474.72 → 4475.72] You're probably good man.
[4475.72 → 4478.72] You're probably not actually writing much.
[4478.72 → 4480.72] So yeah.
[4480.72 → 4483.72] Honestly I like my configuration quite a bit.
[4483.72 → 4486.72] If I added a caching SSD then it would be primo.
[4486.72 → 4489.72] Just like a pretty big SSD.
[4489.72 → 4490.72] Right.
[4490.72 → 4493.72] To run all your programs except for games.
[4493.72 → 4496.72] Because I have way too many games.
[4496.72 → 4498.72] And then a hard drive for everything else.
[4498.72 → 4499.72] Right.
[4499.72 → 4501.72] And like adding a cache to that would be.
[4501.72 → 4502.72] That would be pretty nice.
[4502.72 → 4503.72] Would be nice.
[4504.72 → 4507.72] If I like raid 0.2 SSDs that would be kind of cool.
[4507.72 → 4508.72] If I don't really need it.
[4508.72 → 4510.72] Probably wouldn't notice it that much.
[4510.72 → 4511.72] But still notice it but.
[4511.72 → 4515.72] It's one of those things where I didn't realize that I missed my raid 0 SSD array
[4515.72 → 4518.72] until I sat back down in front of it after being away for a long time.
[4518.72 → 4520.72] And I was just like oh wow.
[4520.72 → 4522.72] You definitely notice it, but I don't know if it's worth.
[4522.72 → 4523.72] For me, I don't think it's worth.
[4523.72 → 4525.72] And part of it I think is I'm running eight of them.
[4525.72 → 4526.72] Yeah.
[4526.72 → 4528.72] So it's that much of a difference.
[4528.72 → 4530.72] Oh I can fly from here.
[4530.72 → 4531.72] Okay.
[4531.72 → 4532.72] Oh crap.
[4532.72 → 4533.72] I don't know if I can do this.
[4533.72 → 4535.72] This guy ditches all the Yogis.
[4535.72 → 4536.72] What do you mean?
[4536.72 → 4539.72] Oh crap down down.
[4539.72 → 4540.72] Oh no!
[4540.72 → 4543.72] I think you have to go like quite a bit further, didn't you?
[4543.72 → 4544.72] Yeah maybe I have to take off here.
[4544.72 → 4545.72] I screwed up.
[4545.72 → 4546.72] This one I've only actually done it a couple of times.
[4546.72 → 4547.72] Oh god.
[4547.72 → 4548.72] You want to see if you die in the switch palace again?
[4548.72 → 4549.72] Oh man.
[4549.72 → 4550.72] Okay there's different coloured switches.
[4550.72 → 4552.72] You know what if you just go to the end you'll be fine.
[4552.72 → 4553.72] Just don't worry about it.
[4553.72 → 4554.72] Why would you press any of the switches?
[4554.72 → 4559.72] Uh just it's okay you can get a one up by collecting all the silver coins that the
[4559.72 → 4560.72] guys turned into.
[4560.72 → 4561.72] Just don't worry about it.
[4561.72 → 4562.72] Man.
[4562.72 → 4563.72] Man.
[4563.72 → 4564.72] Directly right.
[4564.72 → 4566.72] My guy just crouched three times in a row.
[4566.72 → 4568.72] It hasn't happened to the point where it's killed me this time.
[4568.72 → 4569.72] Right.
[4569.72 → 4570.72] And you're going left all the time.
[4570.72 → 4571.72] Like we're just not in good shape.
[4571.72 → 4572.72] That can be crazy.
[4572.72 → 4573.72] Someone says they're waiting for my turn.
[4573.72 → 4574.72] Oh yeah.
[4574.72 → 4575.72] Oh yeah.
[4575.72 → 4576.72] Oh yeah.
[4576.72 → 4577.72] Oh yeah.
[4577.72 → 4578.72] Oh yeah.
[4578.72 → 4579.72] Oh yeah.
[4579.72 → 4580.72] Oh yeah.
[4580.72 → 4581.72] Oh yeah.
[4581.72 → 4582.72] Oh yeah.
[4582.72 → 4583.72] Oh yeah.
[4583.72 → 4584.72] Oh yeah.
[4584.72 → 4585.72] Oh yeah.
[4585.72 → 4586.72] Oh yeah.
[4586.72 → 4587.72] Oh yeah.
[4587.72 → 4588.72] Oh yeah.
[4588.72 → 4589.72] Oh yeah.
[4589.72 → 4590.72] Oh yeah.
[4590.72 → 4591.72] Oh yeah.
[4591.72 → 4594.72] Because they're waiting for my build update.
[4594.72 → 4599.80] I was close to being able to do another one because I was going to go get my glass today
[4599.80 → 4601.80] but we ran out of time.
[4601.80 → 4603.80] But then traffic and then traffic.
[4603.80 → 4604.80] Yeah.
[4604.80 → 4606.08] Traffic was bad.
[4606.08 → 4609.08] Someone asks if I've tried the MCP35X pump before.
[4609.08 → 4610.08] Oh you know what?
[4610.08 → 4612.08] I have a feather up there.
[4612.08 → 4615.08] Personally I prefer 655's.
[4615.08 → 4616.08] Whoa.
[4616.08 → 4618.28] Find room for a 655.
[4618.28 → 4621.90] The other ones are just not quiet enough for me
[4621.90 → 4624.40] The 350 and the 355
[4624.40 → 4626.12] I really want to try and get my dad's
[4626.12 → 4628.12] I can't use it
[4628.12 → 4632.76] Okay, so let's see if I can get this
[4632.76 → 4634.44] I really want to try and get my dad's help
[4634.44 → 4635.92] My dad's a crazy good handyman
[4635.92 → 4639.18] And see if I can thread a 655
[4639.18 → 4640.06] Okay, what do you think?
[4640.56 → 4642.18] Should I try to fly it?
[4642.70 → 4644.18] I don't know if I can fly it
[4644.18 → 4645.04] I don't know if it works that way
[4645.04 → 4646.52] I think you're supposed to jump off the rope
[4646.52 → 4647.50] Twitch chat
[4647.50 → 4649.74] Apparently you need Joshi
[4649.74 → 4652.54] I thought so
[4652.54 → 4654.94] But I don't know how to get through this level with Joshi
[4654.94 → 4656.50] You can get through all this
[4656.50 → 4660.28] Do you have to jump on all the tops of the saws?
[4660.30 → 4661.06] Yes you do!
[4661.28 → 4662.16] That's right!
[4662.68 → 4664.70] Because remember you told me you could jump on the saws
[4664.70 → 4666.58] Yep, that's what to do
[4666.58 → 4667.54] Okay, then I'll be fine
[4667.54 → 4673.36] Someone says apparently you can fly through the whole stage
[4673.36 → 4674.52] And dive bomb under the bar
[4674.52 → 4676.68] But that's really tricky
[4676.68 → 4677.72] You'd need perfect timing
[4677.72 → 4679.34] That sounds pretty nuts
[4679.34 → 4682.24] Here?
[4682.44 → 4682.62] Yep
[4682.62 → 4685.12] You need the super deck set
[4685.12 → 4686.60] With the floating thing
[4686.60 → 4689.34] I have no idea what you're talking about
[4689.34 → 4691.92] How is there
[4691.92 → 4693.78] How can you have no idea what I'm talking about?
[4693.90 → 4695.56] You float with the thing, and you go under the thing
[4695.56 → 4696.78] Alright
[4696.78 → 4697.62] I'll show you
[4697.62 → 4701.12] Oh, I remember that thing
[4701.12 → 4703.08] I don't know where I was supposed to go through
[4703.08 → 4706.80] Oh boy
[4706.80 → 4708.46] It's cool
[4708.46 → 4711.10] Rumble!
[4711.46 → 4712.02] Are you here?
[4713.60 → 4714.44] Did we go up there?
[4715.38 → 4715.86] I'm not sure
[4715.86 → 4717.66] Wow, it's weird
[4717.66 → 4718.16] That's like
[4718.16 → 4718.98] Oh, it's paused
[4718.98 → 4720.12] That's why it seems delayed
[4720.12 → 4721.92] Yay!
[4722.60 → 4723.18] I'm hungry
[4723.18 → 4724.02] Do we have any snacks?
[4724.02 → 4725.02] Uh
[4725.02 → 4728.86] I don't think so
[4728.86 → 4730.38] Do we still have pickles?
[4731.16 → 4732.36] No, there's like two left
[4732.36 → 4734.50] Whoa
[4734.50 → 4735.02] You don't need that
[4735.02 → 4735.68] Just jump over
[4735.68 → 4737.18] I didn't mean to jump on it
[4737.18 → 4738.12] Oh boy
[4738.12 → 4739.52] You think you can get this again?
[4740.00 → 4740.28] Maybe
[4740.28 → 4741.60] Third line
[4741.60 → 4742.10] Bop
[4742.10 → 4742.66] Nope
[4742.66 → 4743.20] What?
[4743.68 → 4744.62] You have to bop it when it's
[4744.62 → 4744.80] Yep
[4744.80 → 4747.40] Do you remember that toy?
[4747.68 → 4748.08] Bop it!
[4748.34 → 4748.76] Twist it!
[4748.86 → 4749.44] Pull it!
[4749.44 → 4751.10] Goodness, I hated that thing
[4751.10 → 4752.46] One of my friends bought it
[4752.46 → 4752.86] And I was like
[4752.86 → 4753.26] Oh, cool
[4753.26 → 4753.74] I can try it out
[4753.74 → 4754.16] Nope
[4754.16 → 4754.86] Terrible
[4754.86 → 4756.52] Hated it instantly
[4756.52 → 4756.92] I was like
[4756.92 → 4758.12] This thing is so dumb
[4758.12 → 4759.28] Simon was awesome
[4759.28 → 4760.28] Just shut up
[4760.28 → 4762.10] As fast as you possibly can
[4762.10 → 4762.84] Oh my goodness
[4762.84 → 4763.54] I missed it again
[4763.54 → 4764.70] Oh, wife
[4764.70 → 4766.04] Hey
[4766.04 → 4769.16] Uh, yeah
[4769.16 → 4770.92] We're just doing the after party right now
[4770.92 → 4771.96] So I guess we're almost done
[4771.96 → 4777.30] Yeah, it took us like an hour to get it going
[4777.30 → 4778.48] Uh
[4778.48 → 4779.34] On account of
[4779.34 → 4781.80] Random technical difficulties as usual
[4781.80 → 4782.60] So you need to get to there
[4782.60 → 4783.92] Oh
[4783.92 → 4788.80] Where is it even?
[4788.90 → 4789.94] Um, do you want to go out tonight?
[4793.48 → 4794.52] So this is it, right?
[4794.94 → 4795.56] Get off, Joshi
[4795.56 → 4796.66] Um
[4796.66 → 4798.80] Yeah
[4798.80 → 4800.32] We'll need the baby
[4800.32 → 4801.68] Is this
[4801.68 → 4805.02] And then he'll want to sleep
[4805.02 → 4805.94] Um
[4805.94 → 4807.10] Do you want me to go out and get something now?
[4809.34 → 4810.50] I don't have a car
[4810.50 → 4810.96] Right
[4810.96 → 4811.54] Um
[4811.54 → 4812.80] Um
[4812.80 → 4813.80] Okay
[4813.80 → 4816.50] I'm open to brilliant ideas
[4816.50 → 4817.38] It just fades
[4817.38 → 4817.80] Okay
[4817.80 → 4820.76] Okay, what can I make?
[4820.76 → 4826.68] Uh, what do we have?
[4826.68 → 4832.64] Do we have wraps?
[4834.26 → 4835.26] Oh
[4835.26 → 4836.80] Oh, ghost house
[4836.80 → 4837.76] Hmm
[4837.76 → 4839.22] Okay
[4839.22 → 4839.30] Okay
[4839.30 → 4840.22] Um
[4840.22 → 4845.56] Can I make like chicken pasta?
[4846.22 → 4846.90] Do we have, uh
[4846.90 → 4847.44] Do we have veggies?
[4847.44 → 4854.90] Do we have a pepper?
[4854.90 → 4859.90] Do we have, uh
[4859.90 → 4861.26] Do we have red sauce?
[4861.26 → 4865.62] Okay
[4865.62 → 4866.22] Okay, that could work
[4866.22 → 4872.72] Um
[4872.72 → 4873.34] Um
[4873.34 → 4877.00] It's up to you
[4877.00 → 4877.36] I can
[4877.36 → 4877.80] I can
[4877.80 → 4878.72] I can deal with it
[4878.72 → 4889.20] Okay
[4889.20 → 4890.00] Okay, maybe do that then
[4890.00 → 4892.58] Um
[4892.58 → 4893.00] Honestly
[4893.00 → 4893.74] I'm easy
[4893.74 → 4894.62] Anything's fine
[4894.62 → 4895.44] I'll have what you have

[4910.66 → 4912.66] Sure
[4912.66 → 4913.66] Um
[4913.66 → 4919.52] This is obviously
[4919.52 → 4920.58] The most interesting part
[4920.58 → 4921.30] Of the stream
[4921.30 → 4922.16] Hold on
[4922.16 → 4922.90] I have to find out
[4922.90 → 4923.70] If there's a
[4923.70 → 4926.16] Thing
[4926.16 → 4931.04] Sorry for that everyone

[4945.72 → 4946.46] Ah, there it is
[4946.46 → 4955.32] Wait a second
[4955.32 → 4958.50] Nothing on the

[4966.92 → 4967.80] Stop trying to
[4967.80 → 4967.88] Stop trying to
[4967.88 → 4968.00] Stop

[4984.62 → 4985.26] There's one
[4985.26 → 4985.82] Uh

[4986.32 → 4986.74] Right at
[4986.74 → 4987.42] Coquitlam Centre
[4987.42 → 4991.38] 1175
[4991.38 → 4992.26] Johnson Street
[4992.26 → 4992.42] No
[4992.42 → 4993.04] I don't think so
[4993.04 → 4998.72] It's um
[4998.72 → 4999.98] It's north of the mall
[4999.98 → 5001.10] So it's kind of like
[5001.10 → 5002.02] Where my parents post is
[5002.02 → 5007.24] 1175
[5007.24 → 5008.58] Johnson Street

[5022.88 → 5023.46] And knocked over
[5023.46 → 5023.64] Two things

[5030.04 → 5031.52] And started screaming at me
[5031.52 → 5032.92] Of course he did
[5032.92 → 5033.20] I was like

[5079.84 → 5080.56] Six drumsticks
[5080.56 → 5081.00] Spicy
[5081.00 → 5083.16] Okay

[5102.62 → 5103.40] Okay I couldn't remember
[5103.40 → 5103.68] How to
[5103.68 → 5105.08] Jump off Joshi
[5105.08 → 5107.02] So this is
[5107.02 → 5107.62] The secret
[5107.62 → 5107.94] Oh
[5107.94 → 5109.38] That's cool
[5109.38 → 5109.96] Yeah
[5109.96 → 5110.80] How are you supposed
[5110.80 → 5111.76] To figure that out
[5111.76 → 5112.58] Uh by being
[5112.58 → 5113.70] A freaking genius
[5113.70 → 5114.64] Someone showed me this
[5114.64 → 5115.26] When I did not
[5115.26 → 5115.96] Figure this out
[5115.96 → 5116.64] That's okay
[5116.64 → 5117.46] Oh no the way
[5117.46 → 5117.98] You're supposed to
[5117.98 → 5118.50] Figure it out
[5118.50 → 5119.36] Is when you go
[5119.36 → 5120.08] Through the exit
[5120.08 → 5121.70] You can see the other one
[5121.70 → 5122.26] Hero yes
[5122.26 → 5123.16] Ah okay
[5123.16 → 5123.76] And I was like
[5123.76 → 5124.82] Yeah because I would
[5124.82 → 5125.70] Notice that
[5125.70 → 5126.40] Yeah that's nuts
[5126.40 → 5127.12] Because like
[5127.12 → 5128.24] Yeah
[5128.24 → 5129.44] Whatever
[5129.44 → 5130.80] I used to spend
[5130.80 → 5132.08] Days literally
[5132.08 → 5133.36] Glitching in Halo 2
[5133.36 → 5134.36] This is like
[5134.36 → 5135.18] Right when Halo 2
[5135.18 → 5135.64] Came out
[5135.64 → 5136.58] I used to do things
[5136.58 → 5137.48] Did you ever play Halo 2
[5137.48 → 5138.16] Like at all
[5138.16 → 5138.62] Or much
[5138.62 → 5140.32] Um
[5140.32 → 5141.46] Halo 2
[5141.46 → 5141.70] No
[5141.70 → 5142.04] Yeah
[5142.04 → 5142.78] Okay
[5142.78 → 5143.44] Yes
[5143.44 → 5144.66] That's probably
[5144.66 → 5145.48] The hardest secret
[5145.48 → 5145.70] In the game
[5145.70 → 5146.14] This is cool
[5146.14 → 5147.18] I've never seen this
[5147.18 → 5147.94] Like I
[5147.94 → 5148.64] It's just
[5148.64 → 5150.02] Access to the star road
[5150.02 → 5150.70] I'm going to go
[5150.70 → 5151.50] Put on some fries
[5151.50 → 5152.24] Alright
[5152.24 → 5154.50] Oh I'm not excited
[5154.50 → 5154.96] For this
[5154.96 → 5156.88] Anyway
[5156.88 → 5157.32] For anyone who
[5157.32 → 5157.82] Played Halo 2
[5157.82 → 5158.16] I don't remember
[5158.16 → 5158.92] The name of the level
[5158.92 → 5159.96] But it's the alien ship
[5159.96 → 5160.78] You know the floating
[5160.78 → 5161.56] Platform in the middle
[5161.56 → 5162.40] You can take two
[5162.40 → 5163.54] Of the gigantic boxes
[5163.54 → 5164.30] And spend like
[5164.30 → 5164.84] Half an hour
[5164.84 → 5165.46] Blowing them up
[5165.46 → 5165.94] With grenades
[5165.94 → 5166.90] So you can get them
[5166.90 → 5167.78] All the way up to the top
[5167.78 → 5168.92] If you put them on
[5168.92 → 5170.02] At the exact same time
[5170.02 → 5170.68] It'll sink the bottom
[5170.68 → 5171.20] Into the floor
[5171.20 → 5173.40] Yup
[5173.40 → 5174.44] I spent too much time
[5174.44 → 5175.02] Doing that
[5175.02 → 5177.86] How do I
[5177.86 → 5178.38] Okay
[5178.38 → 5183.08] Whoa
[5183.08 → 5184.88] No
[5184.88 → 5186.90] If you die
[5186.90 → 5187.50] You're going to be on
[5187.50 → 5188.20] French fry duty
[5188.20 → 5189.76] Uh
[5189.76 → 5190.46] That means I'm probably
[5190.46 → 5190.82] Going to be on
[5190.82 → 5191.46] French fry duty
[5191.46 → 5200.70] I have no idea
[5200.70 → 5201.68] How to do this part
[5201.68 → 5204.02] Aw yeah
[5204.02 → 5204.58] We have the
[5204.58 → 5205.74] King Super Spirals
[5205.74 → 5207.08] King Super Spirals
[5207.08 → 5207.60] Are the best
[5207.60 → 5208.74] I think I'm screwed
[5208.74 → 5209.46] I'm just going to run
[5209.46 → 5210.02] Right through it
[5210.02 → 5218.80] When there is no other way
[5218.80 → 5219.66] Surge forward
[5219.66 → 5221.00] I'm sorry
[5221.00 → 5223.08] I couldn't forget
[5223.08 → 5223.78] How to beat this part
[5223.78 → 5224.36] So I just ran
[5224.36 → 5224.98] Through a ghost
[5224.98 → 5226.08] Oh excellent
[5226.08 → 5226.62] Yup
[5226.62 → 5228.50] Good strategy
[5228.50 → 5229.30] Oh I know
[5229.30 → 5230.38] the Best strategy
[5230.38 → 5231.92] We should start
[5231.92 → 5233.00] A new YouTube channel
[5233.00 → 5234.50] Slick ghost hunting tips
[5234.50 → 5235.48] Slick ghost hunting tips
[5235.48 → 5237.28] Ram your face into it
[5237.28 → 5238.48] And that's good
[5238.48 → 5239.30] I guess none of them
[5239.30 → 5240.06] Can hear you
[5240.06 → 5241.04] Anyway
[5241.04 → 5241.46] Whatever
[5241.46 → 5242.30] It's like you believe
[5242.30 → 5243.16] In ghosts right
[5243.16 → 5243.66] No
[5243.66 → 5245.86] Twitch chat
[5245.86 → 5246.60] Says you're wrong
[5246.60 → 5247.82] Twitch chat
[5247.82 → 5248.44] Isn't even
[5248.44 → 5250.16] You can't read it
[5250.16 → 5250.68] For one
[5250.68 → 5252.40] And for two
[5252.40 → 5252.80] They probably
[5252.80 → 5253.76] Can't even hear you
[5253.76 → 5260.80] He's getting taller
[5260.80 → 5261.38] Okay
[5261.38 → 5263.28] I need that
[5263.28 → 5264.34] Ah
[5264.34 → 5265.88] Ah
[5265.88 → 5269.46] I got it
[5269.46 → 5272.76] Oh no
[5272.76 → 5276.20] Maybe I'll go pee too
[5276.20 → 5278.32] Holy crap
[5278.32 → 5280.54] I have so much ice cream today
[5280.54 → 5283.72] Ugh
[5283.72 → 5285.40] How are you supposed to do this
[5285.40 → 5287.12] I want this down here
[5287.12 → 5288.80] Sure
[5288.80 → 5290.68] I don't think that was right
[5290.68 → 5291.64] Pretty sure that was
[5291.64 → 5292.38] Definitely wrong
[5292.38 → 5293.00] Damn
[5293.00 → 5299.56] Whoa
[5299.56 → 5304.78] That was fantastic
[5304.78 → 5307.52] Okay
[5307.52 → 5308.74] So it is this one
[5308.74 → 5315.32] Are you still alive?
[5315.66 → 5315.90] Yeah
[5315.90 → 5317.12] How's that even possible?
[5317.32 → 5317.78] I don't know
[5317.78 → 5321.72] Just jump through all the ghosts
[5321.72 → 5322.74] Don't worry about it
[5322.74 → 5326.84] I've partially employed that strategy
[5326.84 → 5327.22] Okay
[5327.22 → 5329.02] So where do I need to go?
[5329.20 → 5329.52] Hit it
[5329.52 → 5330.64] Go
[5330.64 → 5331.08] Yay
[5331.08 → 5332.94] Is that the end of it?
[5333.16 → 5333.44] Oh
[5333.44 → 5334.14] Can't remember
[5334.14 → 5334.96] I think I go
[5334.96 → 5335.54] Yeah left
[5335.54 → 5336.32] I have to go left
[5336.32 → 5338.40] Whoa
[5338.40 → 5340.36] All right bro
[5340.36 → 5341.94] Didn't think there was going to be anyone up here
[5341.94 → 5342.76] You still got lots of time
[5342.76 → 5343.36] No, no no
[5343.36 → 5344.06] Keep going
[5344.06 → 5344.40] Keep going
[5344.40 → 5349.04] This one?
[5349.12 → 5349.86] Hold on I'm not sure
[5349.86 → 5350.36] Keep going
[5350.36 → 5351.22] Yeah this one
[5351.22 → 5352.20] Yeah
[5352.20 → 5352.84] Yeah that one
[5352.84 → 5356.48] There you go
[5356.48 → 5357.66] What is this thing?
[5357.74 → 5358.16] Free up men
[5358.16 → 5360.10] That's kind of cool
[5360.10 → 5361.60] What is this thing?
[5362.24 → 5363.48] I don't remember those at all
[5363.48 → 5364.62] There aren't many of them
[5364.62 → 5367.54] There's one in the initial stages
[5367.54 → 5368.44] Really?
[5368.58 → 5369.42] Wow it's getting dark
[5369.42 → 5370.36] And romantic
[5370.36 → 5371.46] Do you want to hit the light?
[5375.46 → 5375.86] Oh
[5375.86 → 5377.42] Oh that wasn't the right exit
[5377.42 → 5377.90] I'm sorry
[5377.90 → 5379.08] Dave
[5379.08 → 5380.88] Whatever
[5380.88 → 5382.74] Crap
[5382.74 → 5383.90] I'll have to remember
[5383.90 → 5386.12] I smashed my face through a ghost
[5386.12 → 5387.54] And I ended up living through the level
[5387.54 → 5388.58] So I'm pretty
[5388.58 → 5390.04] Okay with that
[5390.04 → 5393.40] Did it go anywhere?
[5394.16 → 5394.54] Uh no
[5394.54 → 5395.02] What?
[5395.24 → 5396.28] It went back to the same thing
[5396.28 → 5397.22] Well it's the first of illusions
[5397.22 → 5398.28] So there's always like
[5398.28 → 5399.44] So poppy
[5399.44 → 5400.34] Nonsense
[5400.34 → 5401.06] It's pulling back
[5401.06 → 5401.48] A little bit
[5401.48 → 5402.46] Oh really?
[5403.20 → 5404.02] So annoying
[5404.02 → 5405.42] Come on
[5405.42 → 5407.42] Never mind being able to like
[5407.42 → 5408.16] Win a level
[5408.16 → 5408.88] I can't even
[5408.88 → 5410.64] It hasn't happened that much
[5410.64 → 5412.08] In super critical situations though
[5412.08 → 5412.66] That's true
[5412.66 → 5413.16] Yeah
[5413.16 → 5416.90] But it will
[5416.90 → 5417.66] At some point
[5417.66 → 5418.48] It will kill you
[5418.48 → 5419.08] At some point
[5419.08 → 5420.46] Someone says they know my address
[5420.46 → 5421.42] Because uh
[5421.42 → 5423.28] Yeah that wasn't my address
[5423.28 → 5423.96] That was uh
[5423.96 → 5424.68] Church's chicken
[5424.68 → 5425.54] You can
[5425.54 → 5426.52] You can go there
[5426.52 → 5427.46] And you'll probably be pleased
[5427.46 → 5427.96] With the output
[5427.96 → 5429.42] But it's not his address
[5429.42 → 5436.02] I don't know if I'm supposed to like
[5436.02 → 5437.04] Directly attack people
[5437.04 → 5438.12] But people that call
[5438.12 → 5439.94] Linus' phone
[5439.94 → 5441.36] Like
[5441.36 → 5442.40] What are you doing?
[5445.40 → 5445.80] Really?
[5446.18 → 5446.58] Oh
[5446.58 → 5447.54] Wow
[5447.54 → 5449.26] That's why I had to smash my face
[5449.26 → 5449.92] Against the guy
[5449.92 → 5450.86] Because I was like
[5450.86 → 5451.76] I don't know how to get through this
[5451.76 → 5452.82] So I just smashed my face
[5452.82 → 5453.40] Into the big guy
[5453.40 → 5453.96] And ran through
[5453.96 → 5454.88] Um
[5454.88 → 5456.04] It's just a timing thing
[5456.04 → 5457.16] Yeah I know
[5457.16 → 5458.14] But I screwed it up
[5458.14 → 5458.76] And I
[5458.76 → 5460.12] I let him get too far over
[5460.12 → 5461.12] And then it was like
[5461.12 → 5462.34] Me and him in the big tunnel
[5462.34 → 5465.06] He's literally the size of the tunnel
[5465.06 → 5466.16] The second one has a turret
[5466.16 → 5467.26] Um
[5467.26 → 5467.80] So I was like
[5467.80 → 5468.96] It's not going to happen
[5468.96 → 5471.90] It actually gets pretty easy
[5471.90 → 5472.28] From here
[5472.28 → 5472.56] I don't
[5472.56 → 5475.52] It's just that first big guy
[5475.52 → 5476.48] Hmm
[5476.48 → 5479.52] I just wish I could remember
[5479.52 → 5483.00] What to do for this one
[5483.00 → 5483.76] It might be
[5484.48 → 5485.84] Is it one of those
[5485.84 → 5486.70] Where you have to go through the door
[5486.70 → 5487.40] Multiple times
[5487.40 → 5488.64] And then the outcome changes
[5488.64 → 5489.20] No
[5489.20 → 5490.44] That's the vanilla dome
[5490.44 → 5490.90] Okay
[5490.90 → 5494.36] That happens a lot
[5494.36 → 5495.36] In the more modern ones
[5495.36 → 5495.74] As well
[5495.74 → 5497.06] Is it something to do with that?
[5498.62 → 5499.02] Um
[5499.02 → 5501.22] I can't remember
[5501.22 → 5503.46] I'm going to bet it's something to do with that
[5503.46 → 5505.02] Let's go through this door
[5505.02 → 5505.82] Just to see
[5505.82 → 5506.20] Sure
[5506.20 → 5507.84] No that's a
[5507.84 → 5508.20] Oh
[5508.20 → 5512.46] Oh no this just brings you back to the normal level
[5512.46 → 5512.86] Doesn't it?
[5513.44 → 5513.74] Yeah
[5513.74 → 5514.20] Maybe
[5514.20 → 5515.46] Do you have to fly?
[5516.20 → 5516.54] Woof
[5516.54 → 5517.26] Good dodge
[5517.26 → 5519.60] Woof
[5519.60 → 5520.88] Crazy man
[5520.88 → 5524.06] I don't think so
[5524.06 → 5526.24] They give you a fire flower
[5526.24 → 5528.04] Yeah
[5528.04 → 5529.68] So I don't think you have to fly
[5529.68 → 5532.94] Yeah, but they also give you a cape
[5532.94 → 5534.36] Do they?
[5534.80 → 5535.10] Yeah
[5535.10 → 5537.82] There
[5537.82 → 5538.16] Okay
[5538.16 → 5539.60] Hmm
[5539.60 → 5541.62] Maybe you have to fly a little bit further
[5541.62 → 5542.28] Like up here
[5542.28 → 5545.14] I don't think so
[5545.14 → 5547.88] I still think it's something to do with this thing up here
[5547.88 → 5549.04] That
[5549.04 → 5550.74] Whoa
[5550.74 → 5553.40] Do you have to be small?
[5555.40 → 5555.80] Maybe
[5555.80 → 5557.22] Aw crap
[5557.22 → 5558.14] Well there you go
[5558.14 → 5559.32] Problem solved
[5559.32 → 5560.24] Nope
[5560.24 → 5561.08] That's a one up
[5561.08 → 5563.68] Ah
[5563.68 → 5566.06] Let's just get them to cluster over here
[5566.06 → 5566.68] Thank you
[5566.68 → 5569.10] Come on
[5569.10 → 5571.68] No
[5571.68 → 5572.20] No
[5572.20 → 5574.78] You can survive
[5574.78 → 5576.78] What happens if I go through this one?
[5577.14 → 5578.10] I think that just brings it
[5578.10 → 5578.36] Yeah
[5578.36 → 5580.68] Okay
[5580.68 → 5582.04] Maybe it's just the first door
[5582.04 → 5584.74] Is it the first door?
[5585.32 → 5586.16] No you know what I mean?
[5586.18 → 5586.48] Yeah I know
[5586.48 → 5588.34] It might just be the first door
[5588.34 → 5590.70] We might be massively overthinking this
[5590.70 → 5593.08] I don't think so
[5593.08 → 5594.14] Like I actually
[5594.14 → 5595.28] What do you think that door brings you?
[5595.32 → 5595.74] Just back?
[5596.00 → 5596.46] Not sure
[5596.46 → 5597.36] I guess we'll find out
[5597.36 → 5600.58] Twitch chat's probably telling us
[5600.58 → 5600.96] Yeah
[5600.96 → 5601.72] Probably stupid
[5601.72 → 5602.34] It's okay
[5602.34 → 5603.68] I'd rather figure it out
[5603.68 → 5604.32] I agree
[5604.32 → 5605.58] Oh no
[5605.58 → 5606.68] Okay that's a problem
[5606.68 → 5607.92] No you'll be fine
[5607.92 → 5608.44] There's no idea
[5608.44 → 5610.10] Yeah, but I wanted the cape
[5610.10 → 5611.42] Of course
[5611.42 → 5612.96] It makes my life better
[5612.96 → 5616.84] You got this
[5616.84 → 5618.56] Do I have to go like back or something?
[5621.06 → 5621.76] You can't
[5621.76 → 5623.12] You can't dig them through doors right?
[5623.28 → 5624.14] That is just drops?
[5624.30 → 5624.50] Yeah
[5624.50 → 5625.14] No
[5625.14 → 5634.94] It must be that second door
[5634.94 → 5637.88] I mean first door
[5637.88 → 5643.68] I don't have much time left
[5643.68 → 5645.56] You have two minutes
[5645.56 → 5646.12] You'll be fine
[5646.12 → 5652.34] Okay fine
[5652.34 → 5653.04] I'll try it your way
[5653.04 → 5655.26] I have no idea
[5655.26 → 5655.86] If it's going to be right
[5655.86 → 5656.12] But
[5656.12 → 5659.00] I just think we might be overthinking it
[5659.00 → 5659.86] Okay
[5659.86 → 5661.42] Yeah we'll try it
[5661.42 → 5664.02] No
[5664.02 → 5664.10] No
[5664.10 → 5664.60] No
[5664.60 → 5665.32] Good jump
[5665.32 → 5667.88] There you go
[5667.88 → 5675.16] Super speed
[5675.16 → 5689.64] Just kidding
[5689.76 → 5690.04] You
[5690.04 → 5709.04] Yeah. Well, maybe. We will see I guess. You've got a thing. You hit on it everywhere. There
[5709.04 → 5716.04] you go. Oh, I have a cape again. Oh, poop. Is there any way to jump without activating
[5716.04 → 5730.04] it? Apparently. Yeah, you just have to like just touch it. Ah! Almost. Big Papa says Linus what's
[5730.04 → 5739.04] your favourite old computer parts? Mine's a stick of DDR PC400 from OCT. PC3200. DDR400 by the
[5739.04 → 5745.04] way. From OCT with a golden heat sink. Those were awesome. I think technically that one
[5745.04 → 5750.04] counts as an exit though. So you have to find both of them in order to 96 it. Oh, okay.
[5750.04 → 5754.04] That's cool I guess. So you can either go water level or this way. We still need the other
[5754.04 → 5759.04] solution for the water level. Whatever. I hate water levels but it's all good. Someone
[5759.04 → 5764.04] says Slick what programming languages do you know? Oh! I don't know if I would call it no.
[5764.04 → 5776.04] I practice quite a few programming languages. I made a... my like claim to fame is I made
[5776.04 → 5783.04] a 3D first-person shooter in C++ in like grade 11 or something. Wow, I really thought I could
[5783.04 → 5796.04] hit that K. So that's C++. I did embed... oh this is bad. This is bad. This is bad. This
[5796.04 → 5801.04] is bad. This is bad. I did embed C for a crane. I programmed the motor for a crane. That
[5801.04 → 5809.04] was pretty cool. But then you get him to build a simple forum and... Don't even. And that's
[5809.04 → 5815.04] mostly Mr. Wizard. I can't take credit for that. Mr. Wizard did amazing. Also, that's not much real
[5815.04 → 5820.04] programming. That's more just configuring things. Random troubleshooting. Random troubleshooting
[5820.04 → 5827.04] and configuring things. Yeah. Because Envision Power Services did programming for that. Someone
[5827.04 → 5832.04] asks headset from your stream Linus. Did we ever wear a headset? Earlier you were wearing Taken
[5832.04 → 5837.04] Motion in the announcement. Taken Motion Pulse Wave. Oh, yeah the Pulse Waves. They're actually not that bad.
[5837.04 → 5842.04] But they're really warm. They make your head really warm. But they sound not bad considering.
[5842.04 → 5847.04] Apparently EA knows my address. That's going to be a real problem. Someone asked what do I think
[5847.04 → 5857.04] about the Steel Series 4HD. It's priced appropriately. I had one. I gave it to my wife's parents for
[5857.04 → 5864.04] Skype calls. Mic's great. All Steel Series products have good mics. So there's that. You're going to want to drop.
[5864.04 → 5870.04] Yeah. Just sketch because there's two of the homing guys and I don't have five. They won't get you until your
[5870.04 → 5876.04] leg back goes. There's another mushroom down there too. So you can grab that so that you have some safety.
[5876.04 → 5882.04] Someone says good lord how long have you guys been going at it. Someone says what forum? Really?
[5882.04 → 5892.04] LinusTechTips.com. What forum? LinusTechTips.com. The best forum. Yeah. Don't do it. Not worth it. Just go.
[5892.04 → 5900.04] Good work. Someone asked what I think of the Vulcan Pro. They're excellent. Wait. What's a Vulcan Pro?
[5900.04 → 5906.04] Is that the new one? I think you're thinking of Orion Pro or Vulcan ANC. Those are the actual options. Yeah.
[5906.04 → 5914.04] I just realized that this hasn't been sized correctly this whole time. I really like the Vulcan ANC's.
[5914.04 → 5926.04] There we go. Yeah. Yeah. Vulcan ANC's are outstanding. Yeah. Quite good. I'm not a huge fan of closed headphones in general.
[5926.04 → 5933.04] You want to field this one? Trading card games? What do you think? I liked the original Pokémon. Other than that, I'm not way into it.
[5933.04 → 5948.04] I don't mind the culture. The thing, the one thing that I do like about like, see, trading card games, like, is that magic? Or is magic just called a card game?
[5948.04 → 5958.04] Do you trade them? I don't know. I think so. Furthermore, I know people buy them. Furthermore, I don't know if you like actively trade them, but I know people buy them, so I would assume there's at least some trading that goes on.
[5958.04 → 5971.04] Hmm. Or are they talking about like, uh... I would assume they mean more purely, like, trading games. Trading games. Okay. I have no idea, though. I'm not into that at all.
[5971.04 → 5977.04] Yeah, I mean, yeah. If they're talking about magic, I'm not personally into it.
[5977.04 → 5981.04] Do you believe in magic? Well, I hope you do.
[5981.04 → 5994.04] And I like things that bring nerds together, because nerds don't come together enough. Seriously. Land parties used to be kind of be a thing, but now that the internet is so awesome, land parties are less of a thing. So that's kind of disappointing.
[5994.04 → 6006.04] Yeah, well, it depends on where. I mean, here in Canada, anyway, land parties are not much of a thing. At least here in our city. Yeah. We don't really have any major huge lands or anything like that.
[6006.04 → 6012.04] Not really. Like, we have some okay ones, but they're not that wide spread. But they're really not that big.
[6012.04 → 6017.04] But yeah, I support things that bring nerds together, so magic is... that's cool enough. I'm just not into it personally.
[6017.04 → 6023.04] Someone wants to know if they should go for a top of the line 840 Pro or something mid-range coming from a 5400 RPM drive.
[6023.04 → 6028.04] You know what? Get whatever, because it's going to be... 5400 RPM.
[6028.04 → 6034.04] It's going to be so much faster than what you're using that it's not even funny. While they're still in the bubble, you can touch them.
[6034.04 → 6043.04] Okay. But then as soon as they come out of the bubble... Like face on? Yeah. As soon as they come out of the bubble, though, they're active. And remember, the bombs blow up after a bit.
[6043.04 → 6053.04] So if I let him blow up, then can I go get the... Yep. So that's their blast radius. Someone says, what about MATE boards? I don't know, man. What about MATE boards?
[6053.04 → 6065.04] What about MATE boards? They get no love! Well, they're smaller than regular boards. And it also means that you don't get that until you touch it twice.
[6065.04 → 6068.04] Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. So they're smaller. Whoa!
[6068.04 → 6076.04] Um, yeah. I'm surprised you didn't kill me. It doesn't make any difference to performance. Just keep knowing you don't need it.
[6076.04 → 6081.04] I just wanted to see if that would work. Oh, I guess you do need it. Oh, that's poop.
[6081.04 → 6092.04] Just eat it and then... There you go. You got this. Someone's asking about quantum internet. I wonder how this works.
[6092.04 → 6102.04] So it can only go one-to-one. Quantum internet can only go one-to-one properly because if you try to reroute it to anything, it breaks it.
[6102.04 → 6104.04] Shhh.
[6104.04 → 6105.04] Shhh.
[6105.04 → 6106.04] Pfft.
[6106.04 → 6107.04] Pfft.
[6107.04 → 6108.04] Pfft.
[6108.04 → 6109.04] Pfft.
[6109.04 → 6110.04] Um, so it can only go one-to-one.
[6110.04 → 6112.04] You and all your stuff down the hole.
[6112.04 → 6117.04] Which makes it very secure because if someone tries to reroute it, it breaks the whole thing.
[6117.04 → 6118.04] Which is nice.
[6118.04 → 6120.04] Um, so...
[6120.04 → 6125.04] But then it's not nice because you can only have one packet go to one person, and it has to be a direct line.
[6125.04 → 6128.04] So the second it touched a router and...
[6128.04 → 6132.04] Basically, if you try to figure out where it's going, you will break it.
[6132.04 → 6136.04] Um, so it has to just be sent and just end up where it's supposed to.
[6136.04 → 6139.04] You can't have any network interfaces in between.
[6139.04 → 6147.04] Um, which is great for security on like a closed network, but is not really great for how the internet works.
[6147.04 → 6152.04] Um, but people are working on new types of routers to make this a thing.
[6152.04 → 6153.04] Shoot!
[6153.04 → 6155.04] Ooh, at least you got that.
[6155.04 → 6158.04] Um, which should help.
[6158.04 → 6162.04] And basically how the router works is...
[6162.04 → 6163.04] I'm not going to explain this properly.
[6163.04 → 6166.04] I need an image to explain it properly.
[6166.04 → 6167.04] Uh, maybe we'll do a...
[6167.04 → 6170.04] Maybe I'll get way more information about it, and we'll do it as fast as possible.
[6170.04 → 6171.04] Sure.
[6171.04 → 6172.04] Cool.
[6172.04 → 6174.04] So we'll try and do one of those.
[6174.04 → 6175.04] Because I like...
[6175.04 → 6176.04] I don't know.
[6176.04 → 6180.04] I don't know enough about it to explain it without an image that I can like to point at, so...
[6180.04 → 6181.04] Right.
[6181.04 → 6182.04] Yeah.
[6182.04 → 6186.04] Source Fed actually did a perfect cover of it, which is very basic.
[6186.04 → 6192.04] So you won't get like all the information you could want from it, but it's good enough that you can understand the concept.
[6192.04 → 6193.04] Hard to go wrong with Source Fed.
[6193.04 → 6195.04] Yeah, they're kind of awesome.
[6195.04 → 6196.04] Oh!
[6196.04 → 6199.04] I thought you hit that.
[6199.04 → 6201.04] Is that the secret for this one?
[6201.04 → 6203.04] You're just going to go over?
[6203.04 → 6204.04] I don't know.
[6204.04 → 6205.04] I don't remember.
[6205.04 → 6208.04] I don't think so because it doesn't show another arrow.
[6208.04 → 6211.04] And if you go over, doesn't it usually just end?
[6211.04 → 6213.04] Oh no, this one doesn't have a secret exit.
[6213.04 → 6214.04] Did I die on this right?
[6214.04 → 6215.04] I jumped down a hole.
[6215.04 → 6216.04] Yeah, that was awesome.
[6216.04 → 6220.04] Someone asked what MATE boards I recommend.
[6220.04 → 6221.04] Good ones?
[6221.04 → 6226.04] That have the ports that you need?
[6226.04 → 6228.04] Is what I find to be quite optimal.
[6228.04 → 6229.04] No!
[6229.04 → 6230.04] Wow!
[6230.04 → 6231.04] There you go.
[6231.04 → 6232.04] Looks like you can just wait for it on that thing.
[6232.04 → 6233.04] Oh.
[6233.04 → 6234.04] Why do you, like, do these things?
[6234.04 → 6235.04] Do what things?
[6235.04 → 6236.04] I don't know.
[6236.04 → 6238.04] Spin jump around and almost die from like the most mundane things.
[6238.04 → 6240.04] I don't usually die from the crazy stuff.
[6240.04 → 6241.04] That's what throws me off the most.
[6241.04 → 6243.04] Like, if it's super complicated, I'm usually fine.
[6243.04 → 6244.04] But if it's super basic.
[6244.04 → 6245.04] I just die.
[6245.04 → 6246.04] It's like, oh.
[6246.04 → 6247.04] Wow.
[6247.04 → 6248.04] You just jumped down a hole on you own will.
[6248.04 → 6249.04] Yeah!
[6249.04 → 6250.04] Wow.
[6250.04 → 6251.04] That's what's really cool.
[6251.04 → 6252.04] Right.
[6252.04 → 6253.04] I'm not going to go down a hole on you.
[6253.04 → 6254.04] Just die.
[6254.04 → 6255.04] I don't usually die from the crazy stuff.
[6255.04 → 6256.04] That's what throws me off the most.
[6256.04 → 6258.04] Like, if it's super complicated, I'm usually fine.
[6258.04 → 6259.04] But if it's super basic, I die.
[6259.04 → 6260.04] Just die.
[6260.04 → 6261.04] It's like, oh.
[6261.04 → 6268.00] basic I just died it's like oh well you just jumped down a hole on your own will
[6268.00 → 6273.58] someone asks if we're going to do an unboxing of the k-70 we do like every
[6273.58 → 6280.42] Corsair product like every single they send us everything yeah so yes we will
[6280.42 → 6283.60] always cover pretty much everything from Corsair I mean it's pretty
[6283.60 → 6289.36] straightforward just you can kick that at the other guy you know that didn't
[6289.36 → 6295.54] work well this is the ball apparently you don't always live through the crazy
[6295.54 → 6300.10] stuff can you flip the fries yeah someone asked for an SNES unboxing you
[6300.10 → 6305.80] still have one in box right I have two in box I hate this fortress this is one of
[6305.80 → 6312.46] the hardest levels in the game if I recall correctly I don't know
[6319.36 → 6332.32] I'll flip them in and put them in for another eight minutes oh I'm going to die
[6332.32 → 6338.98] like I am actually Wow I didn't die
[6338.98 → 6352.72] your belief will make me do well if only that were true this fortress is like
[6352.72 → 6357.52] impossible if you don't have all the switch palaces yet like it's actually
[6357.52 → 6363.60] just kind of ridiculous oh I forgot you can't creep forward on that one shoot
[6363.60 → 6367.98] I didn't even know how to get to half of them so apparently at one point in my life I was perfect
[6367.98 → 6370.60] does not happen
[6370.60 → 6373.60] hmm
[6373.60 → 6385.36] someone asked why 660 ti instead of 7950 for the $1500 build honestly they're very
[6385.36 → 6392.34] they're very equal options and I went GeForce for this particular build because I it
[6392.34 → 6398.34] was the point of the build was $1500 gets you great performance now and
[6398.34 → 6404.22] potential to upgrade to SLI later so we went with like the best value board we
[6404.22 → 6408.30] could that support SLI we went with a 700 watt power supply that was pretty
[6408.30 → 6413.34] inexpensive reasonably efficient and was powerful enough for SLI, although you need
[6413.34 → 6418.02] to use adapters for six pins and right now Prosper isn't a great solution so if
[6418.02 → 6424.02] the idea was dual GPU upgrade path in the future without breaking the bank then
[6424.02 → 6426.02] 660 ti was the right choice
[6426.02 → 6430.02] yes please, and you're up
[6430.02 → 6438.02] someone asked would I recommend the GT 70 gaming laptop from MSI yeah sure absolutely
[6438.02 → 6444.02] MSI's gaming laptops are great no complaints here
[6444.02 → 6450.02] I'm probably just going to die again just wait on the middle one or the thing on the
[6450.02 → 6456.02] right wait on the yellow one just wait don't move yeah sorry
[6456.02 → 6470.02] someone says Gigabyte and MSI have always made good products sure
[6470.02 → 6476.02] actually Gigabyte's motherboards weren't that great for a little while there long time ago pre-p65 days
[6476.02 → 6493.02] they had some they had some AMD boards back on 939 that were really nothing special and that colour scheme they had going on back there oh man I remember doing some liquid cooling builds for people back then, and it was like no matter what you put in it is just looked like butt
[6493.02 → 6497.02] yeah
[6497.02 → 6498.02] yeah
[6498.02 → 6499.02] yeah
[6499.02 → 6500.02] told you it worked
[6500.02 → 6501.02] why didn't it work last time I hit him
[6501.02 → 6503.02] get out of here
[6505.02 → 6507.02] like I definitely hit him
[6507.02 → 6510.02] I don't remember the secret in this one
[6510.02 → 6512.02] I think I already got it didn't I
[6512.02 → 6513.02] no
[6513.02 → 6516.02] because I think this accent takes you like backwards
[6516.02 → 6519.02] um what was I going to say
[6519.02 → 6521.02] what's your favourite colour scheme on a motherboard ever
[6521.02 → 6527.02] uh not like I would like to put this in my build
[6527.02 → 6528.02] like just most epic
[6528.02 → 6529.02] what most epic?
[6529.02 → 6530.02] yeah
[6530.02 → 6531.02] that's the same answer
[6531.02 → 6533.02] lam party UV green
[6533.02 → 6534.02] yeah
[6534.02 → 6535.02] love it
[6535.02 → 6536.02] beast
[6537.02 → 6539.02] mine's the uh rainbow MSI boards
[6539.02 → 6540.02] the rainbow ones?
[6540.02 → 6541.02] yeah
[6541.02 → 6543.02] which ones are the rainbow MSI boards?
[6543.02 → 6548.02] they were like pink and yellow and blue and all this it was crazy
[6548.02 → 6550.02] all the RAM slots were like all ridiculous
[6550.02 → 6554.02] do you remember the MSI boards that had that little roller coaster heat pipe on it?
[6554.02 → 6555.02] yeah
[6555.02 → 6557.02] I think that was uh
[6557.02 → 6560.02] 965 days?
[6560.02 → 6562.02] maybe slightly after that?
[6562.02 → 6564.02] it was 775 for sure
[6564.02 → 6569.02] smooth
[6569.02 → 6570.02] smooth
[6570.02 → 6571.02] smooth
[6571.02 → 6572.02] that looked like you touched
[6572.02 → 6573.02] that's awesome
[6573.02 → 6574.02] whatever man
[6574.02 → 6579.02] apparently you didn't so I don't know I'm just saying it looked like it did
[6579.02 → 6582.02] beast
[6582.02 → 6584.02] come on
[6584.02 → 6585.02] not beast
[6585.02 → 6586.02] no
[6586.02 → 6590.02] someone says get it to you now it's 611 in the morning there
[6590.02 → 6593.02] we've been going for a really long time
[6593.02 → 6596.02] someone says how do you like the HTC one do they all come carrier unlocked?
[6596.02 → 6598.02] I like it, they don't all come carrier unlocked
[6598.02 → 6604.02] so we've been either streaming or trying to be streaming for like 5 hours
[6604.02 → 6605.02] 5 hours
[6605.02 → 6606.02] 5 hours
[6606.02 → 6608.02] do you want to finish this one? The uh the normal way?
[6608.02 → 6609.02] uh sure
[6609.02 → 6612.02] you just have to go through the level I already did the secret exit
[6612.02 → 6613.02] alright
[6613.02 → 6614.02] every-
[6614.02 → 6615.02] don't get that
[6615.02 → 6616.02] puffy
[6616.02 → 6617.02] I don't know man
[6617.02 → 6619.02] it looks like a good idea
[6619.02 → 6621.02] yeah you're like done
[6621.02 → 6628.02] this level's really hard with him chucking crap at you
[6628.02 → 6629.02] OOP
[6629.02 → 6630.02] get a star get a star
[6630.02 → 6631.02] don't
[6631.02 → 6632.02] okay
[6632.02 → 6633.02] yeah you got this
[6633.02 → 6636.02] can I have that please? Thank you
[6636.02 → 6638.02] that was ridiculous
[6638.02 → 6639.02] uh
[6639.02 → 6642.02] oh I crouched
[6642.02 → 6644.02] did you see that?
[6644.02 → 6645.02] no
[6645.02 → 6647.02] that was so crappy
[6647.02 → 6650.02] I would keep moving as much as possible
[6651.02 → 6652.02] oh wow
[6652.02 → 6653.02] I was wrong
[6654.02 → 6655.02] sort of
[6657.02 → 6660.02] because if you let them accumulate they will take you out so fast
[6660.02 → 6661.02] right
[6663.02 → 6664.02] you can't get up there no feather
[6664.02 → 6665.02] no
[6665.02 → 6667.02] oh maybe you can go back
[6667.02 → 6668.02] I would go back
[6669.02 → 6670.02] oh yeah that's right
[6672.02 → 6676.02] apparently it's 6am in Croatia
[6676.02 → 6678.02] someone asks us to do a tech quickie
[6678.02 → 6679.02] no, no don't do it
[6679.02 → 6680.02] go just go
[6680.02 → 6682.02] someone asks us to do a tech quickie on downloading RAM
[6682.02 → 6683.02] oh

[6763.02 → 6764.02] shhh
[6768.02 → 6772.02] just because I haven't memorized the level and I happen to survive doesn't mean that I'm bad
[6772.02 → 6774.02] that means you're lucky
[6774.02 → 6779.02] when you haven't memorized the level and your skills are questionable
[6779.02 → 6780.02] oh okay
[6780.02 → 6781.02] jerk
[6781.02 → 6782.02] jerk

[6787.02 → 6788.02] nope
[6788.02 → 6789.02] alright it's not bad
[6791.02 → 6792.02] nope
[6793.02 → 6794.02] cause in
[6794.02 → 6797.02] ha it always drives me crazy cause in Iggy's castle
[6797.02 → 6799.02] you can move forward
[6799.02 → 6800.02] ah
[6800.02 → 6801.02] I just
[6801.02 → 6803.02] I always want to be at the front
[6803.02 → 6808.02] because I've played that castle countless times, but I've only played the stupid fortress a couple of times
[6808.02 → 6809.02] right
[6809.02 → 6816.02] do you have to get this one to go down or what's going on? Why can't we go to five?
[6816.02 → 6818.02] oh no you can go go go
[6818.02 → 6819.02] yeah you can try and beat the castle
[6819.02 → 6820.02] how do we do that?
[6820.02 → 6822.02] you have to beat the uh that one yeah
[6822.02 → 6823.02] okay
[6823.02 → 6826.02] you have to beat it the real way and I can't remember that one so good luck
[6826.02 → 6827.02] oh
[6827.02 → 6828.02] the real way?
[6828.02 → 6830.02] yeah you have to beat it the secret way
[6830.02 → 6831.02] oh the secret way
[6831.02 → 6832.02] yeah
[6832.02 → 6833.02] I'm not going to find this
[6833.02 → 6834.02] you might
[6834.02 → 6835.02] it might just be like down a pipe or something
[6835.02 → 6836.02] okay
[6836.02 → 6839.02] just try every pipe because I didn't see anything that reminded me of anything
[6840.02 → 6842.02] it probably won't be at the very beginning of the level
[6842.02 → 6843.02] I might as well check them all
[6843.02 → 6845.02] fair enough
[6845.02 → 6848.02] okay
[6848.02 → 6849.02] okay
[6849.02 → 6858.02] someone says if my cat has the flu go to the vet
[6858.02 → 6859.02] just like
[6859.02 → 6860.02] yes
[6860.02 → 6863.02] yeah he does that's good he doesn't have the flu he just is a butthead
[6863.02 → 6865.02] definitely just purring like crazy
[6866.02 → 6867.02] oh
[6867.02 → 6868.02] probably not it
[6868.02 → 6869.02] oh
[6869.02 → 6870.02] okay
[6870.02 → 6871.02] not a bad thing
[6871.02 → 6872.02] but you'll get to skip a little bit of the level
[6872.02 → 6873.02] that too
[6873.02 → 6874.02] okay
[6874.02 → 6875.02] okay, okay here we go here we go

[6877.02 → 6878.02] oh
[6878.02 → 6879.02] oh
[6879.02 → 6880.02] no it's going to be the right
[6880.02 → 6881.02] oh
[6881.02 → 6884.02] like I said there's some algorithm to it right?
[6884.02 → 6885.02] yeah
[6885.02 → 6887.02] but apparently like trying to figure it out on the fly
[6887.02 → 6889.02] it's getting crazy crazy crazy hard
[6889.02 → 6890.02] yeah
[6890.02 → 6891.02] wow I got one

[6901.02 → 6902.02] just wait there for it
[6903.02 → 6904.02] you were going to do that anyway weren't you?
[6904.02 → 6905.02] yes
