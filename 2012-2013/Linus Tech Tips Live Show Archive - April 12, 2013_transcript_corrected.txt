[2.20 → 2.56] Alright.
[3.68 → 6.42] Welcome to the Linus Tech Tips live stream.
[7.16 → 10.12] We just had a pre-show for those of you who are confused
[10.12 → 12.74] where we were trying to make sure that the audio is...
[12.74 → 14.20] Oh, slick the camera's crooked.
[15.68 → 17.18] You helped me line it up.
[17.70 → 20.42] No, I can clearly see that you aligned it
[20.42 → 21.48] so that you'll appear taller.
[22.38 → 22.90] What?
[23.46 → 26.88] Why is everything an ego measuring contest with you?
[26.90 → 27.20] What?
[28.70 → 29.30] Unbelievable.
[30.00 → 31.22] I mean, it's just immature.
[31.66 → 33.22] That doesn't even make sense.
[33.24 → 34.92] I'll forgive you if you eat this thermal paste.
[35.22 → 36.68] You set that up, didn't you?
[36.90 → 37.64] The whole thing.
[37.72 → 39.02] No, I actually didn't.
[39.30 → 40.06] No, I'm just...
[40.06 → 42.02] Do you see how crooked it is?
[42.04 → 44.22] I do, but you were the one helping me line it up.
[44.32 → 46.02] For those of you who are wondering...
[46.02 → 46.72] Okay, okay.
[46.88 → 49.48] So, I spend...
[49.48 → 50.92] How much did I spend on this thing?
[51.92 → 54.78] I spent like a few hundred bucks on...
[54.78 → 55.44] No, the tripod.
[55.90 → 56.24] Oh.
[56.86 → 57.94] Maybe it was like 500?
[57.94 → 58.50] I don't know.
[58.56 → 59.12] It was expensive.
[59.12 → 61.64] So, I spend like hundreds of dollars on a tripod
[61.64 → 64.94] that has like a fluid head and like, you know,
[65.00 → 67.10] a bubble level inside it.
[67.30 → 68.82] And then Slick's just like,
[69.14 → 69.98] yeah, legs out.
[71.42 → 72.36] Pointed at the thing.
[73.00 → 75.36] In his defence, we've been in a bit of a hurry.
[75.82 → 77.20] We had a disaster.
[77.40 → 78.00] Oh, God.
[78.00 → 81.28] The likes of which we have rarely encountered.
[81.42 → 82.34] So, it's not...
[82.34 → 82.78] You know what?
[82.82 → 88.44] I'm not usually one to call out a manufacturer on a product where I'm just like,
[88.80 → 90.90] why did this ever make it to market?
[91.04 → 94.02] I can usually see the positive about almost anything.
[94.10 → 97.22] It's like, okay, here's what they were thinking.
[97.22 → 99.78] And I understand why they did this.
[99.84 → 101.40] Even if I don't agree with it.
[101.40 → 107.46] Whereas, this one is just something that never, ever needed to exist.
[107.58 → 109.32] The Aztec Cooler Box.
[110.12 → 113.18] This is what happened to our Aztec Cooler Box.
[113.18 → 115.56] This is a fan blade.
[116.56 → 119.90] It broke off, causing our fan to destabilize.
[119.96 → 123.24] If you guys have ever heard what a destabilized fan sounds like,
[123.28 → 123.96] you're a little...
[123.96 → 125.24] Wow, you're heavy.
[125.82 → 129.60] If you guys have ever heard what a destabilized fan blade sounds like,
[129.66 → 132.20] it is a loud, obnoxious thing.
[133.28 → 136.86] And so our fan blade just came off.
[137.94 → 139.20] And that...
[139.20 → 140.56] Just...
[140.56 → 143.14] It sounded like there was a lawnmower in our computer.
[143.26 → 143.48] Yeah.
[143.74 → 148.08] Which basically, given that the mic sits about a meter and a half away from the computer,
[148.16 → 150.72] would have been a bit of a problem for our live stream tonight.
[150.78 → 154.04] So that was about 12 minutes before we were due to come live?
[154.14 → 154.40] Nine.
[154.74 → 155.34] Nine minutes.
[155.40 → 156.88] Nine minutes we had to fix it.
[157.30 → 158.90] So the cooler box.
[159.34 → 159.54] Okay.
[159.54 → 164.78] It hit the market at a time when Noctua already had the NHU-12P.
[165.40 → 166.96] SE, I think, by that time.
[167.36 → 167.60] Okay.
[167.60 → 168.20] It...
[168.20 → 170.64] Which has an excellent mounting mechanism.
[170.64 → 172.24] Was similarly expensive.
[172.38 → 173.40] I mean, especially when it launched.
[173.46 → 176.88] I think Aztec thought they were going to get $59.99 for it or something ridiculous like that.
[177.68 → 181.64] The cooler box has the worst mounting hardware I think I've ever seen on a cooler.
[181.72 → 182.68] Have you ever seen anything worse?
[183.24 → 184.38] Maybe that Kalman one.
[184.84 → 186.24] That Kalman one could compete.
[186.24 → 188.30] You couldn't mount on anything.
[188.66 → 188.82] Okay.
[188.88 → 192.20] But this one had these custom little like...
[192.20 → 193.50] So it was a tower cooler.
[193.58 → 197.68] But you know how a lot of tower coolers, they'll have like a hold down plate in the middle.
[197.90 → 200.24] And then the fan slides out so you can screw it in.
[200.28 → 201.24] And it holds the whole thing in.
[201.28 → 202.98] And you have like a square bracket underneath.
[203.92 → 208.08] Or I've seen ones that actually have a hole right down the middle of the heat sink.
[208.18 → 210.22] Like I think the tunic tower had that.
[210.22 → 214.42] I've seen ones that have it, and they come with a screwdriver so that you can install the thing.
[214.76 → 215.06] No, no.
[215.42 → 220.14] The cooler box has Phillips head screws under fins.
[221.16 → 224.08] And then the Phillips head screws have knurls on them.
[224.14 → 225.44] So you can turn them by hand.
[225.44 → 228.70] As if you could tighten a heat sink by hand.
[229.26 → 232.08] And then they also have wrenched.
[232.42 → 234.40] Sort of wrench hex around them.
[234.58 → 236.46] So you can get in there with a little wrench.
[236.60 → 239.00] Because you're using this after market cooler.
[239.00 → 242.82] On some motherboard that doesn't have VRM cooling.
[243.46 → 243.90] Right?
[244.84 → 247.68] It actually took me probably about an hour to install that cooler.
[247.98 → 250.16] And I've installed a number of coolers in my life.
[250.26 → 250.36] Yeah.
[250.70 → 253.72] And to take it off the board is going to take forever.
[254.04 → 256.64] So you guys aren't even going to believe what we have right now.
[256.84 → 260.24] Since I have to fix Slick's horrible camera mounting job.
[260.38 → 261.82] I might as well show you guys this.
[261.92 → 263.36] I still don't think that was my problem.
[263.48 → 264.48] I'm still pretty sure.
[264.56 → 265.48] Okay, who set up the tripod?
[266.02 → 266.74] I set up the tripod.
[267.34 → 267.68] Okay.
[269.00 → 270.84] And I was like, alright is that framed good?
[270.88 → 272.82] And you told me to move it because it was too far over.
[272.88 → 273.92] And you told me to zoom in and stuff.
[273.98 → 275.28] Because you can see it on the big monitor.
[277.66 → 277.98] Okay.
[278.16 → 279.06] So check this out guys.
[279.94 → 280.88] Check this out.
[280.88 → 281.44] This is awesome.
[281.44 → 282.36] This is unbelievable.
[282.58 → 283.56] They can't hear you very well.
[283.68 → 284.18] But this is awesome.
[284.26 → 286.46] So there's the ghetto mounted fan on top.
[286.58 → 288.40] Basically there's supposed to be a fan in the middle.
[288.82 → 290.22] Right behind where it says Aztec.
[290.22 → 291.80] And that's where the fan that we had broken.
[292.14 → 293.26] We unplug that one.
[293.60 → 296.70] Put up a Belief Aztec Driscoll on top.
[297.64 → 299.82] And just have it on pushing air through it.
[299.92 → 301.22] So its super ghetto mounted.
[301.58 → 303.54] So tell them this one is disconnected.
[303.64 → 304.44] That one is disconnected.
[304.60 → 306.18] He's trying to point at the fan that's disconnected.
[306.46 → 308.00] You can't really see it very easily.
[308.20 → 309.28] You kind of see it through there.
[309.62 → 310.46] But it's in there.
[310.54 → 311.72] And one of those blades is broken.
[311.88 → 313.42] And then there's one ghetto mounted on top.
[313.54 → 314.34] It's not even mounted.
[314.34 → 317.38] It's ghetto mounted as in didn't do anything.
[317.54 → 318.56] Just put it on top.
[318.96 → 319.40] Yeah.
[319.56 → 321.32] So that's currently our streaming machine.
[321.56 → 324.60] For anyone wondering about how unstable it might be.
[324.78 → 327.10] The camera looks terrible now.
[328.88 → 330.04] Hopefully it autocorrects itself.
[330.16 → 330.90] Yay camera!
[331.24 → 331.82] No, that's me.
[331.92 → 332.52] I just did the game.
[332.62 → 333.06] Oh, okay.
[333.22 → 333.58] Never mind.
[334.66 → 335.36] But yeah.
[335.56 → 339.24] So that's pretty much the stability of our rig right now.
[339.34 → 340.98] So I think we'll be totally fine.
[341.14 → 342.58] I don't actually really think it's a problem.
[344.34 → 346.18] That's...
[346.18 → 351.00] Without the like not moving fan in the middle impeding airflow and all this other stuff.
[351.10 → 356.84] That's like everything that's wrong with our live stream is the philosophy that that's probably not going to be a problem.
[356.86 → 357.80] It's probably okay.
[358.06 → 358.72] It's probably fine.
[358.80 → 359.56] Don't worry about it.
[359.90 → 363.62] So I just realized now that I haven't been looking at Twitch chat or Twitter.
[363.62 → 366.60] So we could have all kinds of issues with our stream at this point.
[367.54 → 368.62] I've been paying attention.
[368.72 → 369.06] Good work.
[369.32 → 369.54] Yeah.
[369.86 → 371.28] You can be not fired today.
[371.52 → 371.80] Yay.
[371.80 → 378.34] Speaking of which, we had a pretty good day at the NCI studio today.
[378.42 → 379.16] Because of B-roll.
[379.48 → 379.72] Yep.
[379.76 → 385.24] Because of our new addition to the team who goes by the name B-roll.
[387.02 → 387.44] What's up?
[387.60 → 388.04] Awesome.
[388.34 → 388.64] I can't.
[388.64 → 390.08] I'm not a gangster.
[390.08 → 391.02] See guys, okay.
[391.16 → 393.50] It's funny because it's like thug sounding.
[393.90 → 394.16] B-roll.
[394.16 → 396.02] But also it's like camera terminology.
[396.18 → 396.96] It's also the B-roll.
[397.56 → 399.90] So he is a friend of Diesel the interns.
[400.36 → 405.32] And so they have a pretty good like teamwork relationship going on.
[405.42 → 409.00] They're not debating every possible aspect of the camera.
[409.00 → 413.72] They go on and on and on about like, I mean get this.
[413.84 → 414.52] Okay, get this.
[415.16 → 415.32] Okay.
[415.52 → 415.68] Okay.
[415.80 → 415.92] Okay.
[416.04 → 416.14] Okay.
[416.14 → 416.16] Here.
[416.16 → 416.90] Are you going to grab their lenses?
[417.22 → 419.60] Oh, I'm doing that.
[420.06 → 420.28] Okay.
[420.70 → 426.64] So this right here, this is the kit lens that comes with the Sony FS700.
[426.84 → 427.32] You know what?
[427.56 → 431.84] As far as kit lenses go, it's a very solidly built little lens.
[432.08 → 433.82] It's not bad.
[434.18 → 441.50] It's, I mean, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they have both refused
[441.50 → 447.10] to use it to the point where Diesel brought all of his own lenses into work and just leaves
[447.10 → 454.34] them here because I don't think he has time to do any viewing outside of work these days.
[454.34 → 457.16] And then get this, get this.
[457.40 → 462.84] B-roll starts on his very first day, shows up, brings all his own lenses.
[463.04 → 466.62] They both refuse to even use each other's fancy lenses.
[467.64 → 471.50] Not, not to, I mean, aside from refusing to use my lens.
[472.76 → 476.78] I'm just like, okay, I guess it means I don't have to buy lenses, which is nice.
[477.34 → 482.26] And now we understand what random people feel like when Linus and I are jabbering on about
[482.26 → 482.82] random things.
[482.82 → 484.46] Memory timings or like...
[484.46 → 488.42] Because they're sitting there arguing about stuff, and we're both just like, I have no
[488.42 → 489.62] idea what's going on.
[489.82 → 491.02] It's like, really?
[491.36 → 492.68] What are they even talking about?
[492.82 → 493.84] It's like, I have no idea.
[493.90 → 500.92] And I mean, the funny thing is, it's, uh, it's all the kind of stuff that no real person
[500.92 → 504.16] watching a video would ever appreciate.
[504.16 → 509.16] Like the actual difference between what they're doing and what could have been done with some
[509.16 → 509.96] cheapo thing.
[510.96 → 512.70] Like I would never notice.
[512.70 → 517.62] And they actually can't even believe that I cannot tell the difference between...
[517.62 → 518.30] 24 and 29?
[518.30 → 521.00] Uh, 24 FPS and 30 FPS.
[521.40 → 524.84] Except that 24 just kind of looks like crappier and blurrier to me.
[525.56 → 528.10] Like, they're just like, oh, it's more cinematic.
[528.30 → 530.26] I'm like, what is, what do you mean more cinematic?
[530.48 → 531.44] What does that even mean?
[532.08 → 532.94] I think you mean there's...
[532.94 → 535.54] I've asked a few times, actually, and I'm still awaiting the answer.
[535.68 → 537.86] What's actually better about 24?
[537.86 → 543.34] Okay, the actual explanation is that for the longest time, films were shot at 24 FPS.
[543.42 → 548.02] Not because they wanted to, I'm pretty sure, but because it was a technological limitation
[548.02 → 548.66] at the time.
[549.04 → 552.46] Because I think before that it was like 20 or something for silent.
[552.88 → 556.94] And then it was like a big deal when it went up to 24 and then sound and then something.
[556.94 → 558.10] Like, there's some kind of history.
[558.26 → 561.36] I'm sure Diesel told me at some point.
[561.36 → 563.34] And I was, I was like kind of half listening.
[564.48 → 570.86] And so the idea, sort of the philosophy, is that we've been trained to watch movies at
[570.86 → 572.20] 24 frames per second.
[572.76 → 575.16] And that is why that looks better to us.
[576.04 → 577.02] Oh, that's so lame.
[577.60 → 579.44] And I totally don't buy it.
[579.52 → 580.46] That's so lame.
[580.60 → 582.20] Smoother motion is smoother motion.
[582.32 → 584.28] It's not like your eyes operate at 24 FPS.
[584.42 → 588.66] And anyone who tells you that there's some kind of like FPS limit to what your eyes can
[588.66 → 588.94] see.
[588.94 → 592.00] Okay, there's a limit to what you can perceive.
[592.12 → 593.46] But it's not in FPS.
[594.48 → 596.94] It just doesn't work that way.
[597.04 → 597.52] It's not.
[598.04 → 599.20] Our eyes aren't going.
[599.38 → 600.42] Your eyes aren't digital.
[600.62 → 601.40] It's not frames.
[601.52 → 602.08] There's no shutter.
[602.72 → 604.74] So it's not quite like that.
[604.74 → 612.18] And while I do agree that there are, at very high frame rates, there are sorts of unnatural
[612.18 → 613.50] looking things.
[613.80 → 617.00] But I don't think that's necessarily to do with high frame rate content.
[617.26 → 622.86] I think that's to do with the tricks that go on to make content look higher frame rate
[622.86 → 623.40] than it is.
[623.40 → 629.56] So if you look at something like Samsung's clear motion TVs, which operated up to 960
[629.56 → 632.62] virtual hertz, where it just looks bizarre.
[632.96 → 634.34] You're like, okay.
[634.68 → 638.46] It's because they're taking 30 or 60 hertz content.
[638.46 → 646.22] Remember, guys, P, like progressive, is the same as FPS, is the same as hertz in the context
[646.22 → 648.96] of it's just how many per second of something.
[649.40 → 650.72] So hertz is cycles per second.
[651.16 → 654.70] P usually refers to progressive frames per second.
[654.84 → 656.40] And then frames per second is frames per second.
[656.40 → 662.48] So if they were to all align, if you had 60 hertz, a 60 hertz TV, it would be doing 60 image
[662.48 → 663.44] refreshes per second.
[663.68 → 667.84] With 60p or 60fps content, you'd be getting new content on every cycle.
[668.12 → 673.42] Whereas these clear motion TVs use backlight flickering, as well as frame rate refreshes,
[673.44 → 677.52] as well as some processing to guesstimate what an in-between frame would look like.
[677.58 → 682.18] So if frame one is here and frame two is here, it'll kind of create a fake frame here,
[682.26 → 682.76] hear, hear.
[682.76 → 686.54] And so it ends up looking kind of weird, but I'm not convinced it would look that weird
[686.54 → 688.16] if we actually shot at...
[688.16 → 691.24] Another thing that kind of blows me out of the water a little bit is like some companies,
[691.58 → 697.64] like gaming companies, will make incredibly awesome in-game cinematic that run at really,
[697.78 → 700.96] really high FPS because they're actively rendered, and they don't look weird.
[702.14 → 706.04] So I don't think I'm that trained to look at 24 FPS.
[706.24 → 709.70] So there's 16 new Twitter interactions, and I'd like to make a bet with you.
[712.00 → 712.70] Diesel's one of them.
[712.76 → 714.14] No, no, no, I don't think so.
[714.46 → 715.68] I don't think he watches the last stream.
[715.68 → 716.30] I don't think so either.
[717.24 → 718.48] I'm not that...
[718.48 → 720.48] My ego isn't that...
[720.48 → 721.36] Okay.
[722.36 → 730.74] Five bucks says, out of those 20 that are there now, at least three of them are defending 24 FPS.
[732.54 → 733.64] What do you think?
[735.52 → 736.52] That's interesting.
[736.52 → 741.90] I'm saying more than 10% are going to defend 24 FPS.
[741.90 → 742.50] See, I'm hedging a little bit.
[742.58 → 742.82] Oh, there's 30 now.
[742.82 → 743.68] Oh, now there's 30.
[743.80 → 744.06] Uh-oh.
[744.14 → 744.90] See, now...
[744.90 → 748.76] If we let this drag on for too long, then they're just going to decide who they want to win.
[748.98 → 749.72] Oh, okay.
[749.80 → 750.90] Because I was going to say no.
[750.90 → 752.10] Okay, I'm still willing to say five.
[752.18 → 752.92] Okay, let's just go see.
[752.98 → 753.52] Let's go for it.
[753.56 → 754.16] Let's go for it.
[754.16 → 754.60] Okay.
[754.72 → 756.10] Unban Barack Obama.
[757.10 → 757.44] Okay.
[757.58 → 758.18] That's him.
[760.16 → 762.34] YT Jackson, 10-10-2.
[762.70 → 763.70] I know who you are.
[764.94 → 766.92] Sabre tooth Z77 or M-Power.
[767.08 → 767.40] Okay.
[767.58 → 768.34] Oh, I might...
[768.34 → 770.04] Oh, I think I'm about to lose this one.
[770.52 → 772.22] Glossy versus matte monitor finish.
[773.30 → 775.26] You can't calibrate your monitor on a website.
[775.42 → 776.74] You need an actual tool for that.
[777.04 → 782.28] See, because the reason why I was going to go against you, actually, is because I think a lot of these are from before.
[782.94 → 783.38] Oh.
[783.38 → 783.68] Oh.
[784.16 → 785.34] We started talking about the topic.
[785.52 → 786.56] The live stream is delayed.
[787.04 → 787.98] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[788.12 → 791.84] Now that we're past, like, the first five or ten, they're probably from before.
[791.84 → 792.88] So I'm in trouble.
[793.52 → 796.62] Mineral oil cooled servers, if it's professionally done, it's probably fine.
[796.72 → 797.94] That's professionally done.
[798.00 → 799.30] Mineral oil cooled servers are a thing.
[799.72 → 801.76] But you can't just, like...
[801.76 → 802.00] Yeah.
[802.08 → 802.30] Yeah.
[802.48 → 804.60] It's not just, like, throwing mineral oil at a server.
[804.72 → 804.94] No.
[805.08 → 806.50] They have that vented to the roof.
[806.78 → 807.34] Like, it's...
[807.34 → 807.86] Hardcore.
[807.94 → 809.82] There's other stuff going on than just the mineral oil.
[810.24 → 812.08] Was Diesel's editing machine built by him?
[812.20 → 813.16] No, I built it.
[813.16 → 815.10] And B-Roll has an editing machine.
[815.20 → 820.86] He actually uses the Steel Series Showcase PC.
[820.86 → 826.62] So it's got an 875K in it, 16 gigs of RAM, GTX 285 for CUBA acceleration.
[827.58 → 829.32] What's the game with the best AI you've played?
[829.36 → 831.82] I really enjoyed the Fear AI, actually.
[831.82 → 837.86] But it got kind of samey eventually, because their tactics were pretty, well, samey.
[838.24 → 838.88] Yes, they are.
[838.96 → 839.90] Uh, Litter Quitter.
[840.16 → 841.90] Uh, I will have an update soon, actually.
[841.96 → 843.58] I finally got footage of the cat using it.
[843.96 → 846.14] The last stage has to be the slowest one, right?
[846.74 → 847.52] Last stage of what?
[847.62 → 848.68] The last stage of Litter Quitter?
[849.80 → 850.04] No.
[850.04 → 850.86] That's the one that takes the longest?
[850.86 → 851.04] Oh, no.
[851.26 → 851.82] It's done.
[851.86 → 852.34] It's ready to go.
[852.34 → 854.82] I've just been waiting to catch the cat using it on the camera.
[855.16 → 855.38] Oh.
[855.60 → 858.52] So are you going to the like, are you going to No Litter Quitter, though?
[858.60 → 858.82] Yeah.
[859.56 → 859.82] Cool?
[860.04 → 860.26] Yeah.
[860.34 → 861.74] That's going to be the most interesting part.
[861.82 → 862.30] I think so.
[862.30 → 862.96] Um.
[864.60 → 864.82] What?
[865.14 → 865.38] Oh.
[865.60 → 865.90] Okay.
[866.02 → 866.24] Nope.
[866.92 → 868.10] Chat's messed up, Linus.
[868.16 → 869.20] The pizza is missing.
[870.50 → 871.32] Oyster pizza.
[871.52 → 873.14] That is quite the thing.
[874.80 → 876.38] That is quite the thing.
[877.66 → 880.46] Uh, please focus the camera on us and not the background.
[880.60 → 882.18] I think we're in focus pretty well tonight.
[882.32 → 883.40] People said this last time, too.
[883.40 → 887.24] I think part of the problem is that he's up here, and I'm back here.
[887.32 → 890.24] Oh, someone says, just for the record, you didn't announce the live stream.
[890.24 → 896.02] Oh, well, that video is supposed to be up and apparently YouTube's just taking its, uh,
[896.34 → 900.98] sweet monkey time to go ahead and get that, to get that going for us.
[901.02 → 902.02] So, I mean, I don't know.
[902.06 → 903.58] Honestly, we're, we start the live stream.
[903.68 → 908.22] It used to be that I'd kind of wait for YouTube peeps to join us.
[908.46 → 912.98] Whereas now, I mean, I figure, um, the people who really want to tune into the live stream
[912.98 → 917.66] are here and the people who want to wait until the YouTube announcement comes out, well,
[917.70 → 920.22] they can wait until the YouTube announcement comes out, and they can join when they join.
[920.24 → 920.94] And that'll be that.
[922.10 → 923.02] Uh, all right.
[923.80 → 925.76] Here's AI is just clever level design.
[925.92 → 926.14] No.
[926.88 → 929.42] Oh, no, no, don't, don't do mineral oil.
[930.26 → 930.66] No.
[932.66 → 935.60] We're going to talk about the Black magic 4K camera a little bit later.
[936.94 → 937.34] Okay.
[937.42 → 942.74] So why don't we dive into our first topic since no one defended 24 FPS and no one even like
[942.74 → 944.60] came to my rescue here.
[944.84 → 946.80] Well, so apparently I owe you five bucks.
[947.42 → 948.60] Was that the yes.
[948.60 → 950.42] Yeah, whatever.
[951.36 → 953.56] You can, uh, you can put it on my tab.
[955.22 → 955.88] Pretty much.
[956.22 → 956.46] Yeah.
[956.94 → 959.12] Um, all right.
[959.48 → 961.22] So what do you get for your first topic?
[961.26 → 961.96] What do you want to talk about?
[962.10 → 962.90] What do you want to do?
[963.18 → 964.48] We can jump right into that.
[964.68 → 964.90] Yeah.
[964.90 → 966.04] Why don't we get into 4K?
[966.18 → 966.34] Okay.
[966.50 → 971.82] So, um, for those of you who, who don't know, I guess it's not in here, but I'll, I'll hold
[971.82 → 973.40] up, I'll hold up the lens as a prop.
[973.90 → 975.30] So I invested in.
[975.62 → 976.30] One quick second.
[976.42 → 980.06] I'm going to be tweeting out links to where we got our topics from the whole night.
[980.06 → 981.42] Oh, okay.
[981.52 → 983.10] So follow at Slick PC on Twitter.
[983.52 → 985.88] If you want to see links to where we got our information from.
[985.88 → 986.12] Yes.
[986.22 → 986.68] References.
[986.68 → 994.60] So Black magic has a, uh, a 4K camera that, well, first they did their, their 2.5K, uh,
[994.60 → 999.90] cinema camera, which was meant to just kind of turn, uh, the entire industry on its head
[999.90 → 1003.40] because it was super compact, and it was, uh, relatively inexpensive.
[1004.20 → 1007.74] And, uh, the only problem was they couldn't produce them because they had issues with the
[1007.74 → 1008.00] sensor.
[1008.10 → 1013.54] The sensor was adapted from some other kind of imaging technology and yields were something
[1013.54 → 1014.56] and such and such and such.
[1014.56 → 1017.40] Anyway, so the prototypes worked, and then the production ones didn't.
[1017.46 → 1019.10] And then they had to revise a bunch of things.
[1019.14 → 1022.28] Anyway, they're shipping them now, but they've announced two new cameras.
[1022.58 → 1028.04] One of them is a mini version of the other one that instead of shooting at 2.5K only shoots
[1028.04 → 1029.68] at 1080p, but I mean, it's full HD.
[1030.34 → 1035.48] Um, but it's tiny, super, tiny and only a thousand bucks.
[1035.72 → 1037.42] This is like almost GoPro sizing, right?
[1037.70 → 1041.56] It's, I mean, it's bigger than a GoPro, but it's like, it's getting there.
[1041.56 → 1047.74] It's got pro grade features in a camera that's like, like, like smaller than a DSLR, which
[1047.74 → 1048.60] is crazy.
[1048.60 → 1056.92] And then they also announced a 4K camera that has a price point of $4,000, which may actually
[1056.92 → 1063.16] turn the industry on its head because the 4K camera I invested in, which is an $8,000 camera,
[1063.66 → 1066.88] um, that was supposed to get a firmware update to make it 4K ready.
[1066.88 → 1067.08] Okay.
[1067.08 → 1069.26] So it's, it's not known at this point.
[1069.58 → 1074.64] First, it was supposed to be coming soon when I bought the camera, which was six
[1074.64 → 1077.28] months ago, and it's now coming soon.
[1077.68 → 1078.78] And you have to pay for it.
[1079.18 → 1080.04] No, not necessarily.
[1080.60 → 1083.08] They don't know if it's pay or not pay yet.
[1084.04 → 1089.30] Also, it requires not one, but two additional pieces of hardware to actually record 4K.
[1089.48 → 1090.62] Which you do have to pay for.
[1090.62 → 1092.60] So, which you, which you do have to pay for.
[1092.60 → 1098.74] So it's going to cost probably like six grand plus Sony's hardware requires a proprietary,
[1098.74 → 1105.68] um, format of, uh, of card to go into it to record to 4K.
[1105.80 → 1107.10] So they have to buy their data storage.
[1107.24 → 1108.54] Whereas Black magic.
[1109.04 → 1109.26] Yeah.
[1109.26 → 1109.46] Okay.
[1109.50 → 1112.48] With that said, the, the FS is going to do slow motion 4K.
[1112.80 → 1113.00] Yeah.
[1113.02 → 1114.14] Which is kind of a big deal.
[1114.44 → 1114.82] Okay.
[1114.82 → 1118.38] But, but Black magic is 30 FPS 4K.
[1118.38 → 1125.62] You can record to standard SD cards or not SD cards, SSDs, uh, any SSD you want, hopefully,
[1125.82 → 1127.02] but we don't know that for sure.
[1127.32 → 1128.84] Uh, you never know.
[1129.14 → 1129.80] Cross your fingers.
[1129.98 → 1131.24] Uh, compression is a problem.
[1131.60 → 1134.42] Um, if your SSD does on the, oh, okay.
[1134.42 → 1137.66] So not on a San Force SSD, but pretty much anything else.
[1137.84 → 1141.06] As long as the sustained data rates are high enough.
[1141.06 → 1145.76] Um, and wait, I think that was the big deal.
[1145.98 → 1146.12] Yeah.
[1146.28 → 1147.56] 4K, it's $4,000.
[1147.76 → 1148.34] You can record.
[1148.46 → 1148.70] Oh yeah.
[1148.72 → 1149.96] And it connects via Thunderbolt as well.
[1150.30 → 1153.52] So you can output via Thunderbolt, which is very, very, very cool.
[1154.00 → 1163.10] Um, so this sort of led me to the realization that 4K is, um, going to come down in price
[1163.10 → 1165.50] faster than a lot of stuff did before.
[1165.50 → 1169.60] Like, do you remember how much a 1080p LCD TV cost at first?
[1169.82 → 1170.14] So much.
[1170.42 → 1176.00] And now you can get like a 1080p fairly nice big LCD TV for like 700 bucks.
[1176.10 → 1177.68] But how long did that take?
[1178.48 → 1180.02] Even like, um.
[1180.02 → 1180.84] Four years, five years?
[1181.64 → 1182.16] Exactly.
[1182.82 → 1186.54] So the first 4K TV really hit the market last year.
[1186.84 → 1187.04] Yeah.
[1187.18 → 1190.24] Sony had a $25,000 4K TV.
[1190.24 → 1191.30] All right.
[1191.66 → 1197.44] Sony, and this is tied into another one of our news items, is releasing a $5,000 4K TV
[1197.44 → 1198.26] this year.
[1198.44 → 1203.66] So we've seen a one-fifth slash in pricing within one year.
[1204.20 → 1204.84] All right.
[1204.94 → 1206.72] So what that tells us is a couple of things.
[1206.80 → 1211.26] Number one is people aren't willing to pay a stupid premium for home entertainment gear
[1211.26 → 1212.88] anymore, which I guess we kind of already knew.
[1212.88 → 1217.90] Like there's, there's one guy who bought that TV and like, dude, you did good.
[1217.90 → 1219.90] Sony's really happy about it.
[1219.90 → 1220.46] You probably enjoyed that for your year.
[1220.94 → 1221.92] It was probably cool.
[1222.16 → 1224.60] Like the one 4K thing that you found to watch on it.
[1224.74 → 1224.92] Yeah.
[1225.22 → 1227.12] For additional reference, they're pretty similar spec.
[1227.50 → 1227.86] Yes.
[1228.84 → 1229.92] They're quite similar.
[1230.04 → 1230.94] Like pretty similar spec.
[1231.10 → 1231.50] Um.
[1232.34 → 1237.52] So, so they've realized that people aren't willing to actually pay extra for that anymore,
[1237.80 → 1241.50] which is sort of, well, which we learned again with three, which we've learned already
[1241.50 → 1242.04] with 3D.
[1242.18 → 1244.84] But I think part of it was like, oh, well, people don't like 3D.
[1244.94 → 1246.50] So maybe that's why they're not willing to pay more.
[1246.50 → 1249.24] But, uh, people always like more resolution.
[1249.40 → 1250.48] So maybe they're willing to pay more for this.
[1250.52 → 1251.30] It looks like not.
[1251.86 → 1255.40] Um, and, where was I going with this?
[1256.20 → 1256.38] Right.
[1256.46 → 1258.14] 4K is coming, and it's going to be cheap fast.
[1258.20 → 1258.34] Right.
[1258.52 → 1259.06] People aren't willing.
[1259.14 → 1262.70] I don't think you're ever going to convince consumers that it's, that a TV is worth more
[1262.70 → 1263.66] than a thousand dollars again.
[1263.90 → 1264.60] Because, right, right, right.
[1264.64 → 1268.16] So the like the four or five-year cycle that it took 1080p to get from super expensive,
[1268.16 → 1269.18] I think it was longer than that.
[1269.18 → 1273.02] Super expensive to just super affordable.
[1273.98 → 1278.70] Um, whereas 4K, I bet it does it in like three years.
[1279.10 → 1280.74] Like you look at what happened with 3D TVs.
[1280.86 → 1282.22] Remember how much those cost at first?
[1282.24 → 1283.24] Yeah, they were stupid.
[1283.32 → 1284.12] Five, six grand.
[1284.24 → 1285.20] And no one cared.
[1285.34 → 1286.84] And no one cared.
[1286.84 → 1287.72] 3D kind of sucks.
[1287.94 → 1296.08] And there's like, the only movies you can watch in 3D are like, Avatar, animated movies,
[1297.38 → 1299.26] name something else.
[1299.90 → 1302.26] Does behind the scenes Avatar have 3D?
[1302.26 → 1305.32] Like, there's not that many.
[1305.32 → 1306.78] Like, The Hobbit, The Hobbit's coming.
[1307.08 → 1311.36] But anyone who paid $6,000 for their TV two years ago to watch The Hobbit now.
[1311.40 → 1312.18] It's pretty upset.
[1312.20 → 1313.00] Sort of got boned.
[1313.08 → 1316.26] Because they could have just gone to the theatre and watched it a hundred times.
[1317.84 → 1318.36] Yes.
[1319.50 → 1320.90] Wow, that's a perfect point.
[1321.00 → 1323.16] You could just go to theatre with a better experience anyway.
[1324.30 → 1326.60] And take all your friends with you.
[1326.98 → 1328.02] Every time.
[1328.54 → 1329.54] Like, many, many, many times.
[1329.54 → 1331.84] Go see it over and over again.
[1332.04 → 1333.10] With everyone.
[1333.38 → 1335.36] Until you're just tired of it.
[1336.48 → 1343.06] Part of this, I think, comes into like the longevity expectation of the old big CRT TVs.
[1343.34 → 1343.90] Like the big...
[1343.90 → 1348.24] It used to have like a wooden cabinet around them that was like nicely crafted and stuff.
[1348.44 → 1350.92] Like the longevity expectation of that was huge.
[1351.02 → 1353.24] So your dad would save up for that forever.
[1353.42 → 1355.00] And then he'd bring it home, and he'd be all stoked.
[1355.00 → 1356.42] And he'd be like, kids, colour.
[1356.84 → 1359.02] Everyone would hang around the colour TV.
[1359.30 → 1359.78] And it was like...
[1359.78 → 1360.30] More inches.
[1360.30 → 1360.54] It is.
[1360.70 → 1361.00] Yeah.
[1361.16 → 1362.48] It was a huge deal.
[1362.64 → 1363.74] It's not anymore.
[1363.98 → 1365.42] TVs are so commodity.
[1365.92 → 1369.94] And so I had recently been considering buying a 4K monitor.
[1370.18 → 1371.64] And there were a couple of reasons for this.
[1371.70 → 1374.92] Number one is my 30-inch monitor died, and I need a replacement anyway.
[1374.92 → 1381.24] Number two was that I want to be able to run 4K benchmarks.
[1381.38 → 1383.62] And number three is I really, really want one.
[1384.72 → 1385.90] Sort of the biggest one.
[1386.68 → 1388.40] So I was looking at buying one.
[1388.46 → 1389.98] I can get one for about $4,500.
[1390.52 → 1394.30] The Sharp PK321 or something like that is the part number.
[1394.30 → 1398.10] But what I realized is a couple of things.
[1398.24 → 1405.88] And this is the biggest thing that I think is going to drive 4K to cascade down in pricing much more quickly.
[1406.18 → 1409.82] Is the technology to produce it is so mature.
[1411.02 → 1413.52] Back when LCDs and...
[1413.52 → 1414.32] Yeah, I'm getting there.
[1414.32 → 1419.22] Back when LCDs or plasmas or anything...
[1419.22 → 1422.46] Like it was actually a new, innovative, exciting technology.
[1422.86 → 1423.42] Especially plasma.
[1423.42 → 1424.88] Especially plasma.
[1425.10 → 1426.18] Man, those were expensive.
[1426.36 → 1431.10] But they were like weird and experimental almost and like hard to do.
[1431.36 → 1431.70] Yes.
[1431.80 → 1432.50] Like, blew.
[1432.66 → 1436.80] Whereas the technology to just make a TV higher res?
[1437.54 → 1438.60] It's like, come on!
[1439.36 → 1442.10] Okay, this phone is 1080p.
[1442.82 → 1445.28] Riddle me this, manufacturers.
[1445.78 → 1450.46] Why exactly, if you can make a 4.7-inch 1080p device,
[1450.46 → 1453.56] can't you make a 9.2-inch 4K device?
[1455.96 → 1459.14] Or a 19-inch 8K device?
[1459.14 → 1461.48] Like, you might have slightly more failure rates, but...
[1461.48 → 1463.80] But why actually can't you do that?
[1463.84 → 1465.30] Yeah, you could definitely...
[1465.30 → 1470.64] Because if you can charge $800 for a phone that actually has a processor,
[1471.24 → 1475.32] and some RAM, and some flash storage, and some cameras...
[1475.32 → 1476.34] Well, we got fairly funky...
[1476.34 → 1476.94] We kind of...
[1476.94 → 1478.38] I don't know if you remember this, but...
[1478.38 → 1480.02] I don't know if it was me or you or one of us,
[1480.10 → 1482.28] but we asked while we were at CES,
[1483.02 → 1484.88] from a couple of the 4K manufacturers,
[1484.98 → 1487.00] when are we going to see these in like 24-inch monitors?
[1487.00 → 1491.76] And everyone gave us this just kind of like weird answers.
[1492.24 → 1494.32] Like, why don't they want to talk about this?
[1494.34 → 1495.78] They do not want to talk about it.
[1495.78 → 1497.36] Like, they were all really weird answers.
[1497.52 → 1500.14] I don't know, the funny thing to me too, though, is like...
[1500.14 → 1503.18] It's not like they're making any money on 1080p monitors anymore.
[1503.28 → 1503.82] I know this.
[1503.94 → 1504.62] It's a commodity.
[1504.84 → 1506.98] The LG 1080p IPS panel.
[1507.02 → 1508.44] The $16499.
[1508.96 → 1509.62] $159 now.
[1509.88 → 1510.22] Really?
[1510.30 → 1510.86] It dropped again?
[1510.86 → 1511.08] It went down again.
[1511.54 → 1512.90] I didn't want to put it in the weekly sale,
[1512.90 → 1514.24] because I've done it like twice already.
[1514.24 → 1517.08] I'm just like, uh, it dropped again.
[1517.18 → 1517.56] I don't know.
[1517.76 → 1518.42] Like, it's unbelievable.
[1518.84 → 1520.58] So if they could even get, you know,
[1520.68 → 1525.16] like $500, $600, $700 bucks for a 4K monitor, why not?
[1525.62 → 1526.00] Yes.
[1526.26 → 1530.48] So anyway, I have put off my 4K monitor purchase,
[1530.68 → 1534.20] because guys like Black magic are coming in
[1534.20 → 1538.66] and destroying the artificial margin
[1538.66 → 1542.94] that's been built up for 4K production equipment.
[1542.94 → 1544.92] So we're going to start seeing content.
[1545.52 → 1549.00] Also, you've got guys like Sony realizing...
[1549.00 → 1550.34] Yeah, that's coming.
[1550.64 → 1552.82] You've got guys like Sony realizing that,
[1552.90 → 1554.74] oh, people aren't going to pay $25,000 for a 4K.
[1554.78 → 1555.84] Okay, let's try 5K.
[1555.90 → 1557.92] I think next year they're going to realize that didn't work either.
[1557.98 → 1558.78] It's going to be $3,500.
[1558.78 → 1561.16] So as that happens,
[1561.32 → 1563.22] the undercutting is going to come really fast
[1563.22 → 1564.66] because the technology is so mature.
[1565.14 → 1567.22] Everyone in their dog could manufacture
[1567.22 → 1570.06] a 30-inch 4K display at this point.
[1571.20 → 1572.54] Like, not everyone in their dog.
[1572.64 → 1573.44] Like, Slick couldn't do it.
[1573.46 → 1573.84] No offence.
[1574.04 → 1574.20] No.
[1574.36 → 1575.20] Like, you're a cool guy.
[1575.32 → 1575.78] You couldn't do it.
[1575.78 → 1576.86] I respect you and appreciate you.
[1576.96 → 1577.90] I couldn't do it either.
[1578.48 → 1580.54] But, oh yeah, the other thing is,
[1580.80 → 1583.50] right now, Sharp pretty much has a monopoly
[1583.50 → 1585.14] on professional 4K monitors
[1585.14 → 1587.52] that don't cost $30,000 like in ISO.
[1588.60 → 1589.52] I was like, what?
[1589.56 → 1590.82] You want $30,000 for it?
[1590.82 → 1591.76] Are you guys drunk?
[1591.90 → 1595.92] With Sharp releasing a $4,500 competitor, like, now?
[1596.78 → 1597.14] Anyway.
[1599.42 → 1604.58] So Sony is prototyping a 30-inch 4K OLED display.
[1604.96 → 1605.60] With that said,
[1605.66 → 1607.80] I don't know if I'm sold on OLED on the desktop.
[1608.74 → 1609.50] It's kind of weird.
[1609.74 → 1611.38] They'd have to put, like, a backplate on it,
[1611.38 → 1613.56] which would just kind of defeat their purpose.
[1613.74 → 1615.70] And I'd have to know that...
[1616.56 → 1619.84] I'd have to know that it's actually
[1619.84 → 1622.14] that many of each colour
[1622.14 → 1623.52] by that many of each colour.
[1623.60 → 1625.60] Like, I don't want to see any sort of tomfoolery
[1625.60 → 1627.42] like what Samsung did with S3
[1627.42 → 1629.58] where your text doesn't look crisp anymore.
[1629.64 → 1631.38] I mean, the whole point of a high-res monitor
[1631.38 → 1633.80] or display is crisp image.
[1634.22 → 1635.70] And if you're using any weird interpolation
[1636.48 → 1637.40] or anything like that,
[1637.44 → 1639.66] you're going to end up with a negative experience.
[1639.98 → 1640.98] Can I use your...
[1640.98 → 1641.92] I can't even copy links.
[1642.60 → 1643.90] Sorry, completely unrelated.
[1644.92 → 1647.56] Slick needs my sexy Aspire S7
[1647.56 → 1648.68] that I still love,
[1649.36 → 1650.78] even though it's not perfect.
[1651.32 → 1651.70] You know what?
[1651.74 → 1653.08] I don't think that YouTube announcement
[1653.08 → 1654.40] has gone out yet for some reason.
[1655.00 → 1656.92] We're having some problems with Google tonight.
[1657.50 → 1657.90] Yeah.
[1658.36 → 1660.24] Google's not so happy with us, I think.
[1660.72 → 1662.20] That's just bizarre.
[1662.58 → 1664.78] I mean, should I just try re-uploading it or something?
[1665.56 → 1665.92] Maybe.
[1666.98 → 1667.98] That's weird.
[1668.32 → 1669.32] Should I give them context
[1669.32 → 1670.50] so they know even what's going on?
[1670.54 → 1671.12] Yeah, sure.
[1671.32 → 1671.50] Okay.
[1671.50 → 1673.56] So I prepared a document,
[1673.76 → 1676.72] a Google document for us earlier today
[1676.72 → 1677.54] for the live stream
[1677.54 → 1678.78] with all of our topics and everything.
[1679.38 → 1680.84] And then when we got back here,
[1681.24 → 1682.86] I went to go try and add some things to it
[1682.86 → 1683.94] and couldn't edit the document
[1683.94 → 1685.26] even though it was under my name.
[1685.84 → 1686.90] Tried on another computer,
[1687.14 → 1688.04] under my name again,
[1688.34 → 1689.54] couldn't edit the document again.
[1689.70 → 1690.68] Like, I'm on the right account.
[1690.78 → 1691.46] Everything's fine.
[1691.54 → 1692.42] I can't edit the document.
[1693.04 → 1693.86] Linus goes on.
[1693.86 → 1695.32] It was shared to him.
[1695.70 → 1697.32] He was able to edit the document.
[1697.80 → 1698.30] Kind of weird.
[1698.60 → 1699.70] But I was still able to, like,
[1699.86 → 1701.64] check links and open links and do stuff.
[1701.94 → 1704.32] Now I can't even, like, copy things.
[1704.58 → 1705.46] I can't copy things.
[1705.54 → 1706.26] I can't open links.
[1706.32 → 1706.84] I can't do anything.
[1706.94 → 1707.66] So that's weird.
[1708.44 → 1710.46] Now we tried uploading a video
[1710.46 → 1711.56] and it's just hanging
[1711.56 → 1713.00] right at the completion part
[1713.00 → 1714.84] and it's not actually uploading the video.
[1714.94 → 1715.06] Yeah.
[1715.06 → 1716.88] So it's been sitting there for half an hour
[1716.88 → 1719.08] because that video should have actually been live
[1719.08 → 1720.42] around the time we launched the live stream.
[1720.46 → 1721.00] Either way,
[1721.28 → 1722.66] for our loyal viewers,
[1722.78 → 1724.32] all 1,500 of you
[1724.32 → 1726.44] who didn't need us to launch
[1726.44 → 1727.70] a YouTube announcement video,
[1727.86 → 1729.46] thank you so much for tuning in
[1729.46 → 1730.96] because otherwise it would just be
[1730.96 → 1733.68] me and you're sitting here
[1733.68 → 1735.22] talking to each other.
[1735.30 → 1736.12] Alone in the garage.
[1736.30 → 1737.26] Alone in the garage.
[1739.84 → 1740.24] Okay.
[1740.30 → 1740.86] It wouldn't be so bad.
[1743.22 → 1744.30] We can't do that a lot.
[1744.30 → 1745.16] Yeah, I know, right?
[1745.68 → 1746.84] All right, what's our next topic?
[1746.94 → 1747.68] So yeah, 4K.
[1747.82 → 1748.72] Don't invest yet
[1748.72 → 1751.26] because it's going to go like this
[1751.26 → 1752.90] and even faster than before
[1752.90 → 1754.72] because it used to be consumer electronics
[1754.72 → 1756.68] and the companies behind them
[1756.68 → 1758.30] were perfect at
[1758.30 → 1761.38] artificially maintaining margin
[1761.38 → 1763.92] compared to sort of computer industry
[1763.92 → 1764.90] where it's just like,
[1764.96 → 1766.76] take everything.
[1767.06 → 1768.18] Free fall forever.
[1769.12 → 1771.04] And then if you make any slight increases
[1771.04 → 1771.86] like RAM,
[1772.26 → 1772.72] just the
[1772.72 → 1774.60] everyone is just like,
[1774.68 → 1775.64] no,
[1776.06 → 1778.42] it's $10 more than it was before.
[1778.68 → 1778.86] Yeah.
[1779.18 → 1780.86] Stop buying RAM.
[1782.04 → 1783.44] So they used to be good at that.
[1783.50 → 1784.42] I don't think they are anymore.
[1784.52 → 1785.28] I think it's over.
[1785.38 → 1786.34] I think people being willing
[1786.34 → 1787.94] to pay a premium for it is over.
[1788.36 → 1790.78] And the desperation will set in
[1790.78 → 1792.82] because the reality of it is
[1792.82 → 1795.08] you cannot have factories sitting idle.
[1795.08 → 1798.18] It will not work.
[1798.34 → 1799.88] That will destroy you faster
[1799.88 → 1801.90] than producing product at a loss,
[1802.04 → 1803.16] believe it or not.
[1803.90 → 1806.46] So there you go.
[1807.46 → 1808.10] It's true.
[1808.36 → 1808.54] Yeah.
[1808.54 → 1809.08] It's completely true.
[1809.54 → 1810.66] We can do Google Buy and WhatsApp
[1810.66 → 1811.68] or Intel Muzzle.
[1811.68 → 1812.32] Here,
[1812.38 → 1814.24] why don't we do a little bit of Twitter Q&A
[1814.24 → 1816.28] since these are apparently
[1816.28 → 1819.96] our most loyal followers here.
[1821.38 → 1821.76] All right,
[1821.84 → 1824.42] just get 3 by the 27-inch Korean IPS display.
[1824.50 → 1825.20] It's not a bad idea,
[1825.28 → 1826.54] although I'd probably go 30 inch
[1826.54 → 1828.74] just because 16 by 9 drives me crazy.
[1829.64 → 1831.38] Bios hock Infinite was amazing.
[1832.02 → 1832.34] Yo.
[1833.14 → 1833.50] Like,
[1833.94 → 1834.36] who.
[1835.10 → 1836.18] Possibly the best game I've played
[1836.18 → 1836.88] in a really long time.
[1837.72 → 1837.92] Like,
[1838.00 → 1839.42] Bios hock Infinite was actually amazing.
[1839.52 → 1839.86] The ending,
[1839.96 → 1840.88] I'm not going to spoil anything,
[1841.04 → 1841.38] but just,
[1842.12 → 1844.08] it's so awesome.
[1844.40 → 1846.24] I replayed the segment again
[1846.24 → 1847.36] just so I could go through everything
[1847.36 → 1849.38] and make sure that I actually got
[1849.38 → 1850.90] every single one of the just
[1850.90 → 1852.44] insane amounts of brain explosions
[1852.44 → 1853.90] that go on for about half an hour.
[1854.38 → 1855.72] They just don't stop.
[1855.94 → 1856.08] Like,
[1857.66 → 1858.10] it's just,
[1858.48 → 1858.64] oh,
[1858.64 → 1859.10] it's amazing.
[1859.32 → 1859.78] So good.
[1860.38 → 1860.94] So good.
[1861.02 → 1861.94] I'm partially doing this
[1861.94 → 1863.02] just because he hasn't played it yet.
[1863.50 → 1864.62] But amazing.
[1865.62 → 1866.00] And like,
[1866.10 → 1867.38] huge fan of Bios hock 1.
[1868.72 → 1869.06] And,
[1869.66 → 1869.96] oh.
[1870.12 → 1870.64] No time.
[1871.20 → 1871.98] So good.
[1873.44 → 1873.80] Yeah.
[1874.02 → 1875.48] Speaking of him not
[1875.48 → 1877.34] sort of doing any spoilers,
[1877.56 → 1878.86] I did get called out
[1878.86 → 1880.06] for Harry Potter spoilers
[1880.06 → 1881.38] in a previous live stream.
[1881.40 → 1881.92] Pretty hardcore.
[1882.16 → 1882.42] I,
[1882.48 → 1883.76] I got an email
[1883.76 → 1885.24] probably about this long
[1885.24 → 1886.12] explaining to me
[1886.12 → 1886.94] that not everyone
[1886.94 → 1888.02] has read Harry Potter
[1888.02 → 1889.38] and watched the movies.
[1889.80 → 1890.28] And apparently,
[1890.50 → 1891.90] I hardcore wrecked the ending.
[1892.52 → 1892.76] So,
[1892.92 → 1894.62] yeah.
[1895.46 → 1896.32] And I think,
[1896.38 → 1897.28] I think the other one
[1897.28 → 1897.88] about me,
[1898.98 → 1900.58] someone said I should have
[1900.58 → 1901.38] spoiler alerted
[1901.38 → 1902.62] my thing about Star Wars.
[1903.06 → 1903.86] I think that one
[1903.86 → 1904.58] might have been a troll.
[1905.14 → 1906.38] But I'm not 100% sure.
[1906.46 → 1907.36] But the Harry Potter one,
[1907.42 → 1908.22] I wanted to apologize
[1908.22 → 1909.80] to all the people
[1909.80 → 1911.90] who I ruined the ending for.
[1913.00 → 1913.36] Uh,
[1913.68 → 1914.12] what do you guys,
[1914.26 → 1914.60] oh yeah,
[1914.70 → 1914.84] okay,
[1914.84 → 1916.06] we already covered that.
[1916.64 → 1917.44] There's one.
[1917.58 → 1918.20] There you go.
[1918.66 → 1919.18] One of what?
[1919.34 → 1920.14] It's coming up.
[1920.84 → 1921.02] Oh.
[1921.02 → 1923.52] actually 24.97 FPS
[1923.52 → 1924.00] that matters.
[1924.10 → 1924.28] Well,
[1924.38 → 1924.86] thank you.
[1926.14 → 1926.70] Um,
[1926.82 → 1927.50] 50 inch,
[1927.58 → 1929.30] $1,200 4K TV.
[1930.02 → 1930.46] Seiko,
[1930.70 → 1931.14] 50 inch,
[1931.24 → 1931.68] see,
[1931.78 → 1932.80] it was a matter of time
[1932.80 → 1933.28] before,
[1933.50 → 1933.74] like,
[1934.00 → 1934.88] that's exactly it.
[1934.88 → 1938.08] some random underdog
[1938.08 → 1939.80] random brand
[1939.80 → 1941.14] because it's not
[1941.14 → 1942.44] actually difficult
[1942.44 → 1943.24] to manufacture
[1943.24 → 1945.56] is gonna just do it.
[1945.56 → 1946.60] And then everyone
[1946.60 → 1948.06] will have to follow.
[1948.72 → 1948.84] So,
[1948.94 → 1949.82] Engadget's reporting
[1949.82 → 1952.44] from SEIKO.
[1952.96 → 1953.96] They've got a 50 inch
[1953.96 → 1955.08] 4K TV for $1,200.
[1955.52 → 1955.54] I think we saw them.
[1955.54 → 1955.90] They're a thing.
[1956.32 → 1957.12] We saw them in CES.
[1957.18 → 1957.38] Okay.
[1957.62 → 1958.14] I think so.
[1958.46 → 1958.66] Well,
[1958.76 → 1958.94] yeah,
[1959.06 → 1959.46] so like,
[1959.50 → 1960.22] like there's no,
[1960.34 → 1960.58] I mean,
[1960.60 → 1961.34] think about it this way,
[1961.38 → 1961.54] guys.
[1961.60 → 1962.88] What costs money to make?
[1962.88 → 1963.56] Is it pixels?
[1963.86 → 1965.04] Is it physical size?
[1965.56 → 1965.80] So,
[1965.98 → 1966.82] if you had,
[1967.06 → 1967.46] um,
[1967.96 → 1968.20] okay,
[1968.28 → 1969.32] so 50 inch diagonal.
[1969.62 → 1969.90] So,
[1969.94 → 1971.34] if you had a 27 inch
[1971.34 → 1972.20] LCD monitor,
[1972.42 → 1973.12] say for example,
[1973.56 → 1974.44] at 1080p,
[1974.54 → 1975.48] what does that cost to buy?
[1975.58 → 1975.96] $250?
[1977.10 → 1977.82] 27 inch?
[1977.88 → 1978.04] Yeah.
[1978.32 → 1978.72] If that,
[1978.96 → 1979.22] $300?
[1979.58 → 1979.82] TN?
[1980.08 → 1980.32] IPS?
[1980.80 → 1981.08] Oh,
[1981.08 → 1982.20] let's say not TN.
[1983.04 → 1983.48] Ooh,
[1983.48 → 1983.96] maybe $350?
[1983.96 → 1984.28] A bit more then,
[1984.36 → 1984.64] probably.
[1984.94 → 1985.20] Okay.
[1985.30 → 1985.42] So,
[1985.46 → 1986.00] if you can produce
[1986.00 → 1986.66] four of those
[1986.66 → 1988.16] for $350 each,
[1988.20 → 1989.04] then you can probably
[1989.04 → 1990.02] make a 4K TV
[1990.02 → 1990.74] for $1,200.
[1990.74 → 1992.58] And so,
[1992.72 → 1992.94] that's,
[1993.00 → 1993.36] that's,
[1993.38 → 1994.18] that's how
[1994.18 → 1995.22] things need to go.
[1995.82 → 1996.74] Slick has different
[1996.74 → 1997.58] clothes today.
[1998.14 → 1998.40] Oh,
[1998.46 → 1998.90] Slick.
[1999.84 → 2000.46] Got it for free
[2000.46 → 2001.02] from my grandpa.
[2002.36 → 2003.64] And that is how
[2003.64 → 2004.74] all of your clothes
[2004.74 → 2005.40] were acquired.
[2006.02 → 2006.54] It's either
[2006.54 → 2007.82] someone gave it to me
[2007.82 → 2008.32] as a gift
[2008.32 → 2009.42] or I got it from Pax,
[2009.56 → 2009.80] so.
[2010.82 → 2011.10] Yeah,
[2011.16 → 2011.36] I mean,
[2011.38 → 2011.72] it's not like
[2011.72 → 2012.42] every industry
[2012.42 → 2013.26] hasn't gotten in trouble
[2013.26 → 2014.02] for price fixing
[2014.02 → 2014.68] at some point
[2014.68 → 2015.10] or another,
[2015.26 → 2015.50] but,
[2015.60 → 2015.88] uh,
[2016.20 → 2016.54] I mean,
[2016.58 → 2016.78] it's,
[2016.82 → 2017.60] it's not even
[2017.60 → 2018.82] always about price fixing.
[2018.82 → 2019.54] A lot of the time
[2019.54 → 2020.20] it's just,
[2020.20 → 2021.26] like,
[2021.44 → 2022.46] maintaining margin
[2022.46 → 2023.16] because you,
[2023.18 → 2024.40] you actually do need
[2024.40 → 2024.96] to make money
[2024.96 → 2025.58] as a company.
[2026.42 → 2026.70] Like,
[2026.80 → 2028.04] if Linus Media Group
[2028.04 → 2029.28] operated on
[2029.28 → 2030.44] no margin
[2030.44 → 2031.04] for anything
[2031.04 → 2031.76] that we did,
[2032.18 → 2033.22] he wouldn't get paid
[2033.22 → 2034.30] and I wouldn't get paid
[2034.30 → 2035.98] and we wouldn't eat
[2035.98 → 2037.94] and we'd go to business.
[2038.22 → 2038.32] Well,
[2038.32 → 2039.36] we don't charge anything
[2039.36 → 2040.70] for our content.
[2041.22 → 2041.38] Well,
[2041.38 → 2042.32] we don't charge viewers.
[2043.24 → 2043.36] Yeah,
[2043.58 → 2044.34] we barely charge.
[2044.44 → 2044.88] However,
[2045.08 → 2046.42] you had a brilliant idea
[2046.42 → 2047.16] for how viewers
[2047.16 → 2047.80] can contribute
[2047.80 → 2048.84] to Linus Media Group
[2048.84 → 2049.62] without actually
[2049.62 → 2050.56] giving us any money.
[2051.40 → 2052.10] Bitcoin mining.
[2052.98 → 2053.26] Okay,
[2053.42 → 2054.12] so other people
[2054.12 → 2054.68] have done this.
[2054.82 → 2056.00] This isn't an original idea,
[2056.50 → 2057.00] um,
[2057.22 → 2057.48] but,
[2057.94 → 2058.82] and people have suggested
[2058.82 → 2059.46] this on the forum.
[2059.76 → 2061.38] There's Bitcoin mining pools
[2061.38 → 2062.18] and if you join a pool
[2062.18 → 2063.04] you can join up
[2063.04 → 2063.64] with a bunch
[2063.64 → 2064.24] of other people,
[2064.70 → 2065.20] join together
[2065.20 → 2066.54] and try and calculate Bitcoins.
[2067.22 → 2067.62] Um,
[2067.82 → 2068.42] the problem is
[2068.42 → 2069.06] when an organization
[2069.06 → 2070.14] runs it like us,
[2070.28 → 2070.92] the only way
[2070.92 → 2072.24] to really legitimately do it
[2072.24 → 2073.42] is if we take everything.
[2074.32 → 2075.16] And we've noticed
[2075.16 → 2076.20] that a few other people
[2076.20 → 2076.76] that are doing it
[2076.76 → 2078.88] aren't that transparent
[2078.88 → 2079.76] about that point.
[2080.90 → 2081.30] Um,
[2081.30 → 2081.82] they're just like,
[2081.86 → 2082.06] yeah,
[2082.22 → 2083.20] join our Bitcoin mining tool.
[2083.34 → 2084.60] Some people spell it out
[2084.60 → 2085.24] but not everyone.
[2085.78 → 2086.14] Um,
[2086.46 → 2086.74] so,
[2086.94 → 2087.64] Like for example,
[2087.92 → 2088.94] Logan from Tech Syndicate
[2088.94 → 2090.12] has a similar thing going
[2090.12 → 2091.16] and it's called out
[2091.16 → 2091.78] specifically.
[2091.78 → 2092.16] It is,
[2092.28 → 2092.52] yes.
[2092.88 → 2093.76] Bitcoin mining
[2093.76 → 2095.04] for Tech Syndicate
[2095.04 → 2096.40] is to benefit
[2096.40 → 2097.08] Tech Syndicate.
[2097.24 → 2097.40] Yeah,
[2097.82 → 2099.12] and if we started one
[2099.12 → 2099.86] it would be
[2099.86 → 2100.66] to benefit us
[2100.66 → 2101.22] because it's,
[2101.34 → 2101.64] it's,
[2102.54 → 2103.56] I don't exactly know
[2103.56 → 2104.22] how it all works
[2104.22 → 2105.06] but to be able to make it
[2105.06 → 2105.54] so that there's like
[2105.54 → 2106.44] equal payouts and everything
[2106.44 → 2107.00] we would have to,
[2107.06 → 2108.44] I think we have to be doing it too
[2108.44 → 2109.66] and like pretty hardcore
[2109.66 → 2110.48] and,
[2110.84 → 2111.32] But that's fine
[2111.32 → 2111.88] because we can.
[2112.36 → 2112.68] We can.
[2112.68 → 2113.44] We can turn it on.
[2113.70 → 2114.34] We can turn it on
[2114.34 → 2115.10] and we probably will
[2115.10 → 2115.92] at some point.
[2116.24 → 2116.56] Um,
[2116.70 → 2117.40] We probably should
[2117.40 → 2117.98] at some point.
[2118.06 → 2118.60] I mean it feels,
[2118.74 → 2120.38] even with the volatility lately,
[2120.74 → 2121.34] I mean,
[2121.46 → 2122.28] It's going to stay around
[2122.28 → 2122.60] I think.
[2122.66 → 2123.40] There's a few of them
[2123.40 → 2124.02] that seem to be
[2124.02 → 2124.60] kind of popping up
[2124.60 → 2125.00] and disappearing
[2125.00 → 2126.22] but Bitcoin seems to be
[2126.22 → 2126.80] kind of staying around.
[2126.80 → 2128.24] The thing I like about Bitcoin
[2128.24 → 2130.06] is not the anonymity,
[2130.22 → 2130.60] actually.
[2130.94 → 2131.08] I mean,
[2131.14 → 2131.86] It's not anonymous.
[2132.08 → 2132.58] That's what,
[2132.78 → 2133.22] Oh,
[2133.36 → 2133.94] a lot of it is.
[2133.94 → 2134.76] You can track transactions
[2134.76 → 2135.36] 100%.
[2135.36 → 2136.62] There's a permanent log
[2136.62 → 2137.44] of every single transaction.
[2137.80 → 2138.16] Okay,
[2138.30 → 2139.28] Every single person
[2139.28 → 2140.00] knows everything
[2140.00 → 2140.64] that's going on.
[2143.14 → 2143.62] Bam.
[2144.40 → 2146.14] That's not the impression
[2146.14 → 2146.78] that I'm under.
[2147.12 → 2148.20] That's 100% it.
[2148.50 → 2149.64] Attaching the ID
[2149.64 → 2150.84] to your actual person
[2150.84 → 2151.28] is hard
[2151.28 → 2151.86] but if you're,
[2151.92 → 2152.18] Okay,
[2152.22 → 2152.60] well that,
[2152.78 → 2153.02] there,
[2153.12 → 2154.18] that's what I'm talking about.
[2154.32 → 2154.50] Okay,
[2154.56 → 2154.82] hold on,
[2154.88 → 2155.06] hold on.
[2155.06 → 2156.28] Personal anonymity?
[2156.28 → 2156.44] Yeah,
[2156.54 → 2157.62] so it's a way
[2157.62 → 2158.68] to electronically
[2158.68 → 2159.74] still be anonymous
[2159.74 → 2161.14] without doing a cash deal.
[2161.28 → 2161.50] Right,
[2161.60 → 2161.80] okay.
[2161.94 → 2162.62] That's what I mean by,
[2162.62 → 2162.98] I didn't,
[2162.98 → 2163.22] No,
[2163.32 → 2163.98] I didn't mean like,
[2164.08 → 2165.36] protecting your unique IDs
[2165.36 → 2165.62] and stuff.
[2165.62 → 2165.76] No,
[2165.76 → 2165.88] no,
[2165.88 → 2166.06] no,
[2166.06 → 2166.20] no,
[2166.20 → 2166.32] no,
[2166.32 → 2166.40] no,
[2166.40 → 2166.50] no,
[2166.50 → 2166.52] no,
[2166.52 → 2166.60] no,
[2166.60 → 2166.74] no,
[2166.74 → 2167.68] so the anonymity,
[2167.76 → 2168.32] I don't know
[2168.32 → 2169.24] if I like that much.
[2169.32 → 2169.62] I mean,
[2169.74 → 2169.94] the
[2170.04 → 2170.60] the
[2170.60 → 2170.92] the
[2170.92 → 2172.50] It's going to happen anyway.
[2172.66 → 2172.88] Personally,
[2172.92 → 2173.48] I don't care.
[2173.94 → 2174.30] Okay,
[2174.50 → 2175.28] yes.
[2175.64 → 2176.58] Massive transactions,
[2176.78 → 2177.76] people always call them out.
[2178.40 → 2178.56] Yes.
[2178.56 → 2178.90] So it's going to be
[2178.90 → 2179.78] fairly small transactions
[2179.78 → 2180.46] which are pretty easy
[2180.46 → 2181.34] to do under the table anyway.
[2181.44 → 2182.06] I really don't think
[2182.06 → 2182.56] it'll change anything.
[2182.56 → 2182.58] Okay,
[2182.58 → 2183.28] this is true,
[2183.72 → 2185.42] but the thing that I do like about it
[2185.42 → 2186.58] compared to other currencies
[2186.58 → 2187.88] is you can't print more.
[2188.66 → 2188.84] Yeah,
[2188.90 → 2189.38] there's a fixed amount.
[2190.12 → 2191.78] There's a fixed number of bitcoins,
[2191.88 → 2193.08] so the curve goes like this,
[2193.30 → 2194.34] how many can exist,
[2194.54 → 2195.30] and then it maxes.
[2195.36 → 2195.54] I think,
[2195.60 → 2195.86] what is it,
[2195.90 → 2196.76] 30 million bitcoins
[2196.76 → 2197.42] or something like that?
[2197.46 → 2198.98] I can't remember the number,
[2199.10 → 2199.50] it's something,
[2199.66 → 2199.88] some,
[2199.88 → 2201.04] some number of bitcoins,
[2201.50 → 2202.04] and so,
[2202.22 → 2202.48] I mean,
[2202.48 → 2203.54] that's the thing
[2203.54 → 2205.32] that makes something like gold
[2205.32 → 2206.70] actually valuable
[2206.70 → 2209.04] is that you actually can't
[2209.04 → 2210.52] just cut down a few more trees
[2210.52 → 2213.12] and manufacture a bit more ink
[2213.12 → 2215.06] and make more of it
[2215.06 → 2217.50] because there's a finite amount
[2217.50 → 2218.26] on the earth
[2218.26 → 2219.36] and it's actually,
[2219.36 → 2219.84] like,
[2219.96 → 2220.76] useful for something.
[2220.92 → 2222.18] And that's the one disadvantage
[2222.18 → 2223.28] bitcoin has against gold.
[2223.40 → 2224.18] It's not actually useful.
[2224.24 → 2225.90] Gold is actually useful.
[2226.20 → 2226.26] Like,
[2226.36 → 2226.48] it's,
[2226.64 → 2228.42] you manufacture things.
[2228.42 → 2228.44] Like,
[2228.44 → 2229.44] you're going to consume it
[2229.44 → 2229.84] in some way.
[2229.86 → 2232.08] And people just intrinsically value it
[2232.08 → 2234.34] because it's inert
[2234.34 → 2235.88] and it doesn't corrode
[2235.88 → 2237.64] and it's great for,
[2237.80 → 2238.20] it's,
[2238.32 → 2239.36] all these different things.
[2239.98 → 2240.34] Um,
[2240.70 → 2241.72] it doesn't corrode
[2241.72 → 2242.50] and all that kind of stuff.
[2243.22 → 2244.20] Bitcoins aren't going to corrode.
[2244.26 → 2244.66] Okay,
[2244.76 → 2245.94] you can lose them though.
[2246.48 → 2247.82] You can legitimately lose bitcoins
[2247.82 → 2248.88] and then they're gone forever.
[2249.90 → 2250.18] Okay,
[2250.40 → 2250.52] fair enough.
[2250.52 → 2250.98] So the
[2250.98 → 2252.36] the fixed maximum
[2252.36 → 2254.02] is actually going to dip
[2254.02 → 2254.64] a little bit.
[2254.96 → 2255.06] Right.
[2255.06 → 2256.50] But the amount that it's going to be measurable
[2256.50 → 2257.58] because most people are going to be
[2257.58 → 2258.58] really careful with their bitcoins.
[2258.82 → 2259.38] Because basically,
[2259.58 → 2260.78] if you have your wallet,
[2260.78 → 2262.18] because you locally store your wallet
[2262.18 → 2263.54] or you can store it in the cloud,
[2263.62 → 2265.28] but then that's not guaranteed in any way.
[2265.58 → 2266.98] And if they run with all your bitcoins
[2266.98 → 2269.36] or if they just close at all,
[2269.42 → 2269.96] it's just like,
[2270.02 → 2270.18] oh,
[2270.64 → 2271.44] that's unfortunate.
[2271.72 → 2273.04] So I just wouldn't do that.
[2273.08 → 2273.30] No.
[2273.42 → 2274.48] So if you locally store it
[2274.48 → 2275.40] and your drive dies,
[2276.34 → 2277.04] your bitcoins are gone.
[2277.44 → 2277.76] Right.
[2278.22 → 2279.24] So back up your data.
[2279.42 → 2281.46] Yet another back up your data lesson.
[2281.66 → 2281.96] Yeah.
[2282.30 → 2283.32] Back up your money.
[2283.60 → 2283.92] Back up,
[2283.92 → 2284.78] back up your,
[2284.92 → 2285.72] back up your money.
[2286.96 → 2287.36] Yeah,
[2287.52 → 2287.82] that.
[2287.82 → 2288.14] Okay.
[2288.26 → 2289.34] So I'm going to be really interested.
[2289.70 → 2290.32] It's finally out.
[2290.66 → 2290.94] Okay.
[2291.02 → 2291.30] Finally.
[2291.52 → 2291.68] Yeah.
[2291.76 → 2293.14] I'm going to be interested into
[2293.14 → 2295.42] the first time that there's a huge
[2295.42 → 2296.86] e-heist
[2296.86 → 2298.32] on bitcoins.
[2298.76 → 2301.22] When someone jacks like a bunch of bitcoins.
[2301.24 → 2302.06] It'll happen at some point.
[2302.06 → 2303.20] There's tracked transactions.
[2303.42 → 2305.20] So I'm wondering how that's actually going to go down.
[2305.44 → 2306.00] But then like,
[2307.28 → 2307.98] oh man,
[2308.30 → 2308.60] I think,
[2308.74 → 2310.14] I'm sure it'll happen at some point.
[2310.36 → 2311.44] Someone will figure something out.
[2311.54 → 2313.88] Like nothing's completely infallible.
[2313.88 → 2314.22] I mean,
[2314.26 → 2315.82] you look at why it,
[2315.86 → 2316.14] uh,
[2316.14 → 2317.44] why it fell so dramatically.
[2317.44 → 2318.24] It was because,
[2318.24 → 2318.90] uh,
[2319.00 → 2319.30] Mt.
[2319.38 → 2321.12] Go or whatever they call themselves,
[2321.24 → 2325.10] the biggest Bitcoin exchange was getting DDoSed for like a couple of days.
[2325.44 → 2328.06] And that caused just mass panic.
[2328.06 → 2332.26] And the Bitcoin fell to almost half of its recent previous high.
[2332.34 → 2332.92] With that said,
[2332.94 → 2333.68] it was on a bubble.
[2333.68 → 2336.26] So who knows sort of what's going on.
[2336.34 → 2336.96] So it'll be,
[2337.58 → 2338.12] honestly,
[2338.52 → 2339.92] still label me a skeptic.
[2340.24 → 2343.20] I'm still a skeptic about the whole virtual currency thing.
[2343.20 → 2347.92] I still think gold and diamonds and actually probably diamonds to a lesser extent,
[2347.92 → 2351.72] because if anyone ever figures out how much diamond there actually is out there,
[2351.76 → 2353.22] I suspect the value is going to go like this.
[2353.92 → 2354.10] But,
[2354.14 → 2354.38] uh,
[2354.44 → 2354.64] but,
[2354.76 → 2355.62] but gold to a
[2355.62 → 2356.86] gold to a greater extent,
[2356.86 → 2360.62] I think is going to still be just like it was a thousand years ago.
[2360.70 → 2362.46] And a thousand years before that,
[2362.52 → 2364.00] it'll be a thousand years from now,
[2364.06 → 2364.74] still a currency.
[2364.74 → 2365.52] So there,
[2365.80 → 2366.80] you can quote me on that.
[2368.08 → 2368.48] Um,
[2369.06 → 2370.48] so anyway,
[2370.58 → 2371.86] if it's not a currency,
[2371.86 → 2372.88] it'll be highly valued,
[2373.14 → 2374.22] valued and tradable,
[2374.36 → 2375.32] just like bitcoins are.
[2375.42 → 2375.72] Tradable.
[2375.90 → 2376.04] Yes.
[2376.04 → 2376.70] So it's,
[2376.82 → 2377.36] yeah.
[2377.58 → 2377.76] Yeah.
[2377.86 → 2379.54] You'll be able to get currency for it.
[2379.88 → 2380.64] Apparently you play,
[2380.74 → 2381.82] got hacked by some Russians.
[2382.04 → 2382.14] You play,
[2382.18 → 2383.18] did get hacked by some Russians.
[2383.30 → 2387.28] They unlocked all their available games, and they got a playable version of Blood Dragon.
[2388.22 → 2388.60] Really?
[2388.88 → 2389.12] Yeah.
[2389.54 → 2391.14] So there's some leaked footage online.
[2391.24 → 2393.02] So be careful if you're worried about spoilers.
[2393.52 → 2396.00] Blood Dragon isn't being released until May 1st.
[2396.00 → 2397.90] So if you're waiting for it,
[2398.34 → 2399.70] we might as well talk about Blood Dragon.
[2399.86 → 2400.06] Okay.
[2400.26 → 2400.54] So,
[2400.92 → 2401.54] um,
[2402.26 → 2402.54] it's,
[2402.62 → 2404.66] it's called Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon,
[2404.88 → 2409.10] but has nothing to actually do with Far Cry 3 other than like the back end.
[2409.28 → 2411.18] And you'll notice like if you knife some guy,
[2411.24 → 2412.44] it's the exact same animation.
[2412.90 → 2416.14] And like sometimes you'll see people running around, and it's the exact same thing.
[2416.14 → 2419.34] And a lot of the enemies are done with like the exact same AI,
[2419.54 → 2420.76] the exact same movement patterns,
[2420.98 → 2421.58] like the exact same,
[2421.66 → 2422.26] all that kind of stuff.
[2422.26 → 2424.68] But the whole idea of the game,
[2424.78 → 2425.62] the layout of the game,
[2425.72 → 2426.70] the timeframe of the game,
[2427.20 → 2428.46] all that kind of stuff is different.
[2428.64 → 2430.42] When you're like roaming around in free roam,
[2430.78 → 2432.46] there's still like jaguars and stuff,
[2432.82 → 2434.96] but now they're like robotic and have laser eyes.
[2436.72 → 2438.26] So Blood Dragon is...
[2438.88 → 2438.98] Oh,
[2439.38 → 2441.00] that's like headache inducing.
[2441.44 → 2443.74] It's like everything that was bad about gaming.
[2444.16 → 2444.44] It's,
[2444.44 → 2445.78] it's almost the 80s.
[2445.92 → 2448.48] So all the cut scenes and everything are like brutal 8-bit.
[2448.92 → 2452.10] Your guy is called like Rex Colt,
[2452.10 → 2453.30] Sergeant Rex Colt,
[2453.38 → 2455.82] which is like just the best name ever.
[2456.32 → 2456.56] It's,
[2456.62 → 2458.56] it's kind of amazing.
[2458.66 → 2460.04] The whole thing is an homage to the 80s.
[2460.32 → 2460.88] It's like,
[2461.56 → 2462.70] if you've ever heard of Kandinsky,
[2463.20 → 2464.50] the like techno artist,
[2464.78 → 2465.92] electronic artist guy,
[2466.24 → 2467.80] like everything is in that style.
[2467.90 → 2469.16] There are crazy lights everywhere.
[2469.30 → 2470.40] LEDs are on everything.
[2470.80 → 2471.62] Every single ladder,
[2471.76 → 2473.64] the sidebars are like covered in LEDs
[2473.64 → 2475.20] and the crossbars are covered in LEDs.
[2475.20 → 2477.92] And your guns shoot like tracer.
[2478.10 → 2479.16] Everything shoots tracer.
[2479.52 → 2481.54] There's just like,
[2481.96 → 2482.08] your,
[2482.20 → 2485.00] your like blade just has a big light on it
[2485.00 → 2487.10] because it's the 80s.
[2487.26 → 2490.72] And we're talking about in the future in 2007.
[2491.28 → 2491.70] Blah,
[2491.72 → 2491.86] blah,
[2491.92 → 2492.06] blah.
[2492.12 → 2494.70] Like the whole thing is supposed to be in the future in 2007.
[2494.92 → 2495.78] So it's in the past now,
[2495.86 → 2496.02] whatever.
[2496.38 → 2497.98] It looks really cool.
[2498.50 → 2501.02] You can probably only seriously appreciate it
[2501.02 → 2503.10] if you played games from back in the day.
[2503.30 → 2504.04] 15 bucks.
[2505.10 → 2505.32] Yeah,
[2505.50 → 2506.24] it's 15 bucks.
[2506.34 → 2506.82] It's standalone.
[2507.04 → 2508.36] So you don't need to own Far Cry 3.
[2508.54 → 2510.18] If you were in the
[2510.18 → 2510.58] um,
[2510.60 → 2511.30] never settle bundle,
[2511.88 → 2512.76] you just get it.
[2512.94 → 2513.30] Every,
[2513.40 → 2514.98] every single possible bundle level.
[2515.08 → 2516.60] So don't worry about which bundle level you're on.
[2516.74 → 2519.16] You just get retroactively.
[2519.36 → 2519.68] You get it.
[2519.74 → 2520.44] So that's awesome.
[2520.80 → 2521.60] That's amazing.
[2521.84 → 2522.10] Yeah.
[2522.34 → 2523.76] What AMD is doing with their never settle bundle.
[2523.86 → 2524.66] We've talked about this before,
[2524.66 → 2525.70] but that's just crazy.
[2525.86 → 2525.96] Yeah.
[2525.96 → 2528.24] We'll give them some more attention yet again.
[2528.80 → 2530.22] That's a 79 70.
[2530.38 → 2533.72] If you bought that or anything remotely like it in the last few months,
[2533.72 → 2536.88] you're probably going to get a copy of Far Cry,
[2537.36 → 2537.68] uh,
[2537.68 → 2539.02] or Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
[2539.18 → 2540.76] So there you go.
[2540.84 → 2541.12] Very,
[2541.24 → 2541.78] very cool.
[2541.92 → 2542.40] And I mean,
[2542.40 → 2542.62] it's,
[2542.62 → 2547.92] it's so rare to take a customer that you already got their money and give more
[2547.92 → 2549.76] things to them, and they bought a graphics card.
[2549.76 → 2554.14] So it's not like they're going to be a customer again for a bit until they're done
[2554.14 → 2555.22] with that graphics card.
[2555.96 → 2557.04] And just be like,
[2557.16 → 2557.46] okay,
[2557.68 → 2558.12] here you go.
[2558.42 → 2560.22] Here's like a
[2560.30 → 2563.80] what is probably going to sell incredibly well additional adder.
[2564.06 → 2564.36] Yes.
[2564.60 → 2565.32] And it's like,
[2565.36 → 2567.50] it's not like it doesn't cost AMD anything.
[2567.50 → 2574.20] Like guys do not underestimate how much it costs manufacturers to include a game
[2574.20 → 2575.72] with your piece of hardware.
[2575.72 → 2577.44] One of the most confusing things I saw,
[2577.60 → 2578.58] this was on the forum actually,
[2578.64 → 2580.34] I don't remember who it was or what thread it was in or anything,
[2580.64 → 2581.42] but someone was like,
[2581.64 → 2582.02] um,
[2582.38 → 2586.34] I don't take games into consideration when buying graphics cards because I'm just
[2586.34 → 2587.30] going to buy them anyway.
[2587.56 → 2588.08] And I was like,
[2588.08 → 2590.60] Oh my goodness.
[2591.48 → 2594.04] Like you're going to buy that anyway.
[2594.20 → 2598.28] Having it come with your graphics card is literally only saving money.
[2598.28 → 2599.66] It's like cash.
[2599.80 → 2601.42] It's pretty much putting cash in your pocket.
[2601.42 → 2603.02] Especially if you were going to buy it anyway.
[2603.08 → 2604.28] If you weren't going to buy it anyway,
[2604.28 → 2606.08] then maybe you don't factor it in.
[2606.08 → 2606.58] Don't really factor it in.
[2606.78 → 2606.92] Yeah.
[2606.92 → 2607.56] Wow.
[2607.72 → 2608.12] Really?
[2608.58 → 2609.00] A hundred percent.
[2609.10 → 2611.10] And I was just all my confusion.
[2611.50 → 2611.72] Yeah.
[2611.80 → 2612.32] And I mean,
[2612.40 → 2612.52] I,
[2612.66 → 2612.82] you know,
[2612.86 → 2614.64] honestly I've heard this argument before too.
[2614.72 → 2615.14] People are like,
[2615.18 → 2615.26] Oh,
[2615.30 → 2618.64] well the game manufacturer should just give the game to the graphics card guys to
[2618.64 → 2619.56] like get it out there.
[2619.58 → 2620.20] And I'm just like,
[2620.44 → 2622.54] that's like the most asinine thing I've ever heard.
[2622.60 → 2624.04] If they give you like a discount code.
[2624.16 → 2624.30] Yeah.
[2624.36 → 2625.18] It's that's like,
[2625.40 → 2627.44] that's like saying that,
[2627.44 → 2627.78] uh,
[2627.82 → 2628.06] you know,
[2628.14 → 2628.58] red,
[2628.90 → 2629.06] the
[2629.10 → 2629.24] uh,
[2629.24 → 2633.90] the camera company that makes super high end 4k cameras should just give their cameras to
[2633.90 → 2635.96] every studio to use to get their name out there.
[2635.96 → 2637.18] That's their customer.
[2637.82 → 2642.74] It's the only customer they have like some new game with some fancy engine.
[2642.96 → 2645.94] Like if they gave it to everyone who bought a new graphics card,
[2646.02 → 2648.66] they just gave it to everyone who could possibly buy it.
[2648.82 → 2649.92] Like that's not,
[2650.04 → 2651.60] that's not getting your name out there.
[2651.66 → 2652.10] That's just,
[2652.20 → 2654.42] that's just giving away potential sales.
[2654.60 → 2656.24] That's not how marketing works.
[2656.32 → 2656.96] Not at all.
[2657.38 → 2658.18] Like at all.
[2658.60 → 2659.20] So yeah,
[2659.36 → 2660.14] blood dragon looks amazing.
[2660.22 → 2661.10] It's 15 bucks.
[2661.24 → 2662.46] So it's like nothing.
[2662.78 → 2664.94] If you can't afford 15 bucks right now,
[2664.94 → 2665.96] wait for the summer sale.
[2666.16 → 2667.36] It'll probably go on sale.
[2667.62 → 2667.76] Yeah,
[2667.76 → 2668.10] probably.
[2668.26 → 2670.32] So if you're worried about the 15 bucks now,
[2670.34 → 2672.80] it'll probably be 10 or eight or something.
[2674.48 → 2676.40] Or it'll come like bundled with something else.
[2676.58 → 2677.40] It's like cool.
[2677.58 → 2678.56] Considering it already is.
[2678.72 → 2679.04] I don't know.
[2679.10 → 2679.58] Um,
[2679.64 → 2680.72] back up your money and data.
[2680.84 → 2681.12] Yes.
[2681.46 → 2682.62] YouTube announcement just went up.
[2682.68 → 2682.82] Yeah,
[2682.82 → 2683.22] we know.
[2684.18 → 2684.70] Uh,
[2685.12 → 2686.58] apparently it's sunny in the
[2686.62 → 2686.80] uh,
[2686.80 → 2687.68] in the down under town.
[2687.74 → 2689.56] It's raining like crazy here.
[2689.66 → 2690.22] So it sucks.
[2690.22 → 2690.58] Yeah.
[2691.00 → 2691.40] Um,
[2691.60 → 2695.16] bitcoins are obtained by basically calculating numbers.
[2695.50 → 2698.84] You do calculations and the calculations are getting harder all the time.
[2698.94 → 2699.14] At the
[2699.14 → 2699.68] at the beginning,
[2700.04 → 2703.46] anyone with any random CPU could start calculating getting bitcoins.
[2703.66 → 2706.96] It has now become to the point where if you actually expect to get bitcoins,
[2707.08 → 2709.06] you better be CPU and GPU mining.
[2709.06 → 2713.46] And it's going to get to the point soon where if you actually expect to be getting bitcoins,
[2713.54 → 2715.12] you better be running a seek miner.
[2715.58 → 2716.48] And after that,
[2716.56 → 2717.56] I don't even know what to expect.
[2718.96 → 2719.56] But yeah,
[2719.64 → 2722.92] it's getting brutal because everyone is jumping on this.
[2723.34 → 2727.62] And like just solo mining by yourself with a CPU is like,
[2727.76 → 2729.84] if you get bitcoins,
[2730.10 → 2732.08] like good job.
[2732.18 → 2732.92] That was pretty lucky.
[2732.92 → 2739.06] Because it's basically only the last person to finish the final number crunch,
[2739.14 → 2739.68] so to speak,
[2740.10 → 2743.60] actually gets the benefit of all the work that went into creating that Bitcoin.
[2743.84 → 2745.54] I took this analogy from someone else.
[2745.64 → 2747.40] So this isn't my idea,
[2747.50 → 2748.28] but I don't remember the guy's name.
[2748.34 → 2749.20] So I can't actually quote him.
[2749.36 → 2749.58] Sorry.
[2749.98 → 2754.10] But the way he described it, and it was perfect is it's a gigantic mine at the beginning.
[2754.46 → 2757.04] And all the top is just covered in bitcoins.
[2757.14 → 2758.04] And as you go down,
[2758.12 → 2762.00] there's less and less and fewer bitcoins and the rock and everything gets denser and denser and denser.
[2762.00 → 2763.98] So it's harder to get and there's less.
[2764.30 → 2765.30] The calculations are harder,
[2765.44 → 2766.48] the calculations take longer,
[2766.64 → 2767.80] and there's less of them.
[2767.92 → 2769.58] So as we go down and down and down and down,
[2769.88 → 2773.94] it's going to become almost impossible for people running just CPU mining to get anything.
[2774.32 → 2774.44] Yeah.
[2775.62 → 2778.72] Here, let's move into another one of our discussion topics for the night.
[2778.80 → 2783.54] Why don't we talk about the increases in speed for a couple cool interfaces.
[2783.96 → 2784.30] All right.
[2784.38 → 2789.94] So USB 3.0 is going to apparently be increasing their spec to 10 gigabits per second.
[2789.94 → 2792.88] And Thunderbolt is next-gen Thunderbolt.
[2792.98 → 2794.26] It's supposed to be two times faster.
[2794.82 → 2796.30] So 20 gigabit per second.
[2796.46 → 2796.60] Yeah.
[2796.76 → 2801.48] So the arms race between USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt is in full force.
[2801.82 → 2803.50] So for those of you who don't know,
[2803.64 → 2807.10] I guess let's do a little bit of discussion about USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt.
[2807.24 → 2807.98] So right now,
[2808.42 → 2814.12] they're rated at 5 gigabits per second for USB 3.0 and 10 gigabits per second for Thunderbolt.
[2814.12 → 2819.62] Now, you know, this is kind of funny because I've heard the argument that USB 3.0 is inferior,
[2820.08 → 2822.88] just in general, because much like USB...
[2822.88 → 2826.12] So remember the old USB 2.0 versus FireWire argument?
[2827.14 → 2827.36] Yeah.
[2827.52 → 2830.14] Where FireWire was 400 megabits per second,
[2830.30 → 2832.24] USB 2.0 was 480 megabits per second,
[2832.28 → 2833.30] but it was a shared bus.
[2833.84 → 2836.38] So all the USB 2.0 ports had to share that bandwidth,
[2836.52 → 2838.50] but FireWire was a dedicated point-to-point,
[2838.70 → 2840.02] you have this no matter what.
[2840.32 → 2840.76] You know what?
[2840.76 → 2842.44] I call bollocks on that argument.
[2842.58 → 2843.58] That's a stupid argument.
[2844.08 → 2846.46] And I've heard the same one for Thunderbolt versus USB 3.0
[2846.46 → 2847.90] because quite frankly,
[2848.40 → 2851.70] who is the only person in the world
[2851.70 → 2854.44] who has plugged so many USB 3.0 devices in
[2854.44 → 2856.20] that they've saturated them to the point
[2856.20 → 2858.42] where they're not fast enough with 5 gigabits shared?
[2859.88 → 2861.56] How many devices do you need
[2861.56 → 2863.66] that are very demanding and very intensive
[2863.66 → 2865.40] plugged into a computer at a time?
[2865.48 → 2866.34] No average user,
[2866.92 → 2868.28] but they've got like a keyboard, a mouse,
[2868.74 → 2870.42] maybe a standalone mic.
[2870.42 → 2872.26] And then some kind of storage thing.
[2872.40 → 2873.02] Maybe a storage thing.
[2873.02 → 2874.04] Or like a capture thing.
[2874.62 → 2875.70] And that's probably it.
[2875.78 → 2877.88] And then they've still got like tons of headroom.
[2877.98 → 2879.58] And there's still headroom, for sure.
[2879.72 → 2882.20] Unless we're talking like 4K capture
[2882.20 → 2883.14] or something like that.
[2883.18 → 2884.72] In which case, you know what?
[2884.82 → 2886.98] You should probably just be recording
[2886.98 → 2888.72] to an SSD directly anyway
[2888.72 → 2890.48] over a real storage interface.
[2890.52 → 2892.34] Or have like a standalone added card.
[2892.54 → 2894.16] Because the problem with Thunderbolt
[2894.16 → 2896.58] is that it's actually not,
[2896.76 → 2898.22] it doesn't perform that great.
[2899.02 → 2901.78] Back when we tested USB 3 versus Thunderbolt
[2901.78 → 2903.88] with dedicated storage devices,
[2904.00 → 2906.38] in fact, I think one of them's on the wall behind us,
[2906.44 → 2907.22] kind of right there.
[2907.40 → 2907.56] Sorry.
[2907.64 → 2908.94] No, I'm trying to point in the camera.
[2909.14 → 2910.50] I know, but you poked my head.
[2910.50 → 2914.00] What we found was that USB 3
[2914.00 → 2915.72] was better optimized for random IO.
[2916.32 → 2918.72] Which means it's more like SATA than Thunderbolt
[2918.72 → 2920.62] and actually performs better
[2920.62 → 2923.36] unless the data is entirely sequential
[2923.36 → 2924.46] than Thunderbolt.
[2926.36 → 2928.06] Which is just, it's better optimized,
[2928.20 → 2928.70] in my opinion.
[2929.04 → 2930.02] And I mean, to me,
[2930.14 → 2931.84] I mean, yeah, Thunderbolt is interesting
[2931.84 → 2934.04] as like a single sort of point to point.
[2935.04 → 2935.72] And it's kind of nice
[2935.72 → 2938.10] if you have like two baller monitors.
[2938.68 → 2938.96] Yeah.
[2938.96 → 2939.72] And it's like, door.
[2940.22 → 2942.82] But I mean, even that is like, why?
[2943.14 → 2943.52] I don't care.
[2943.52 → 2944.48] Does it actually matter?
[2944.56 → 2947.84] And the fact that the bandwidth drops
[2947.84 → 2949.26] after each daisy chain
[2949.26 → 2950.66] means you've probably lost
[2950.66 → 2952.58] a good 25 to 30% of it
[2952.58 → 2954.68] by the time you reach that fifth or sixth device.
[2955.72 → 2958.20] We've measured about a 10% drop each time.
[2958.20 → 2961.98] And that's not even in bottlenecked situations.
[2961.98 → 2965.16] So that's us taking just like two hard drives
[2965.16 → 2966.62] and going, how fast is this one now?
[2966.70 → 2967.84] Just going off the second one.
[2967.98 → 2969.84] So there's nothing going on with the first one.
[2969.92 → 2971.04] Nothing going on with the first one.
[2971.10 → 2974.30] So it's like, it's not, it's not that great.
[2974.48 → 2976.42] I'm not that sold on this whole Thunderbolt thing.
[2976.46 → 2977.68] I mean, if it was actually optical
[2977.68 → 2979.10] the way that it was supposed to be.
[2979.46 → 2979.74] Yeah.
[2980.02 → 2981.18] And it could do distance,
[2981.72 → 2982.78] then that'd be cool.
[2983.12 → 2985.40] But USB 3 with an active cable.
[2985.40 → 2987.48] Because yeah, we've got powered,
[2987.86 → 2989.52] like awesome, or not powered,
[2989.64 → 2991.54] but like chips on each end, active cables.
[2991.54 → 2993.14] You can do 10 meters, no problem.
[2993.44 → 2993.58] Yeah.
[2993.90 → 2995.06] That's pretty far.
[2995.16 → 2995.92] It's quite substantial.
[2996.12 → 2997.58] That's as far as I can imagine
[2997.58 → 3000.50] most things you plug into a computer needing to go.
[3000.66 → 3002.64] So, I mean, I think Thunderbolt
[3002.64 → 3004.70] is probably going to go the way of FireWire.
[3004.94 → 3005.10] There.
[3005.46 → 3006.54] You can quote me on that.
[3007.48 → 3010.92] Unless it gains such widespread adoption
[3010.92 → 3014.88] that, you know, your entire system
[3014.88 → 3017.88] is connected to the entire everything else
[3017.88 → 3018.54] via Thunderbolt.
[3018.54 → 3021.12] But then you've got 50 bucks a cable.
[3021.78 → 3022.84] No, well, they'll be cheap by then.
[3023.30 → 3024.06] In all likelihood.
[3024.30 → 3025.36] It's taken a long time.
[3025.48 → 3026.86] It hasn't been out that long.
[3026.92 → 3027.90] It's been out like a year and a half.
[3028.00 → 3028.24] Come on.
[3028.42 → 3029.86] Still, there's still 50 bucks a cable
[3029.86 → 3030.72] than they were when they came out.
[3030.90 → 3031.44] Well, okay.
[3031.52 → 3032.84] Yeah, but it's not mainstream.
[3033.00 → 3033.58] It's still niche.
[3033.78 → 3035.26] But then it has to get mainstream.
[3035.58 → 3037.42] It has to get mainstream somehow.
[3037.66 → 3038.64] USB 3 is just...
[3038.64 → 3042.00] It may just be doomed to be just niche
[3042.00 → 3043.54] and that'll be that forever.
[3043.54 → 3046.28] And the unfortunate thing about Thunderbolt
[3046.28 → 3048.56] is that it requires compatibility
[3048.56 → 3051.36] through the chipset itself,
[3051.50 → 3051.84] through the CPU.
[3051.94 → 3053.80] Like, Thunderbolt will not work
[3053.80 → 3055.32] on an X79 platform
[3055.32 → 3056.92] because it has to be integrated
[3056.92 → 3057.72] with DisplayPort,
[3057.82 → 3058.92] which means it has to have
[3058.92 → 3060.34] an onboard video component.
[3060.96 → 3061.94] So the only way Thunderbolt
[3061.94 → 3063.22] is going to be able to be implemented
[3063.22 → 3065.20] on computers is going to be...
[3065.20 → 3066.02] Not like FireWire,
[3066.12 → 3066.84] where you can just put
[3066.84 → 3067.98] an add-in FireWire card.
[3068.06 → 3069.18] You can't do that with Thunderbolt.
[3069.26 → 3069.78] You have to have
[3069.78 → 3071.14] a supporting infrastructure as well.
[3071.24 → 3072.32] So I think that's going to be
[3072.32 → 3075.10] a major, major stopping point
[3075.10 → 3075.70] for it as well.
[3075.78 → 3076.80] I mean, think about it this way.
[3076.88 → 3078.22] The only real application
[3078.22 → 3079.54] I can think of for Thunderbolt,
[3079.72 → 3081.00] even at 10 gigabits per second,
[3081.12 → 3081.70] never mind 20,
[3082.08 → 3082.98] is something like
[3082.98 → 3084.34] professional video capture.
[3084.58 → 3084.76] Yeah.
[3085.18 → 3086.64] And maybe it's just the industry I'm in,
[3086.68 → 3087.38] but that's the only thing
[3087.38 → 3088.14] I can really think of
[3088.14 → 3089.68] or any kind of mass data
[3089.68 → 3091.16] professional capture.
[3091.88 → 3092.22] Okay.
[3092.42 → 3093.18] But then you're at like
[3093.18 → 3094.90] super niche professional level anyway.
[3095.04 → 3095.24] Yes.
[3095.46 → 3097.30] And does super niche professional level
[3097.30 → 3099.62] anything use a single socket
[3099.62 → 3101.12] consumer grade machine?
[3103.72 → 3105.56] Oh, that's a perfect point
[3105.56 → 3107.90] because now they have to use USB 3.
[3110.42 → 3110.86] Interesting.
[3110.86 → 3110.90] Right?
[3110.90 → 3112.72] Because that didn't clear right away.
[3112.80 → 3114.86] X79 doesn't support Thunderbolt.
[3114.86 → 3115.04] It won't have it.
[3115.24 → 3116.68] And then the second you go to dual CPU,
[3116.90 → 3118.70] it's not going to have onboard graphics.
[3118.78 → 3119.24] That's right.
[3119.68 → 3121.44] Well,
[3122.04 → 3122.58] so I don't know.
[3122.58 → 3123.50] There's some, I guess.
[3123.86 → 3124.96] We'll see what happens.
[3125.10 → 3125.42] And I mean,
[3125.50 → 3126.56] the problem with
[3126.56 → 3128.06] sort of Thunderbolt
[3128.06 → 3129.26] sort of connecting everything
[3129.26 → 3130.32] is why
[3130.32 → 3131.82] and how long is it going to take?
[3131.88 → 3133.72] We still have VGA cables around
[3133.72 → 3134.66] for crying out loud.
[3134.76 → 3135.62] Do you know a single
[3135.62 → 3136.96] dual CPU board
[3136.96 → 3138.18] that has DisplayPort?
[3138.46 → 3139.38] Because there are some servers,
[3139.60 → 3140.34] like servers will have
[3140.34 → 3140.98] onboard graphics,
[3141.04 → 3141.68] but I don't know any
[3141.68 → 3142.14] that have DisplayPort.
[3142.14 → 3143.58] Most of them have VGA still.
[3143.58 → 3144.60] Yeah, not DisplayPort.
[3144.60 → 3146.38] Like you look at how slow
[3146.38 → 3147.64] professional grade equipment
[3147.64 → 3148.52] actually moves.
[3148.90 → 3150.42] Why would you have a server
[3150.42 → 3151.24] with DisplayPort?
[3151.36 → 3152.14] That's ridiculous.
[3152.32 → 3152.46] Anyway,
[3153.02 → 3154.18] that's why I like,
[3154.24 → 3155.38] that's why I would never see it.
[3155.44 → 3156.22] Or like a high-end
[3156.22 → 3157.96] workstations type of device.
[3158.10 → 3158.36] I mean,
[3158.44 → 3158.94] maybe,
[3159.36 → 3159.62] but,
[3159.62 → 3161.02] but we're talking so niche
[3161.02 → 3161.90] for so long
[3161.90 → 3162.72] that by then it just
[3162.72 → 3164.16] might not actually be relevant.
[3164.48 → 3164.86] I mean,
[3164.94 → 3166.90] if USB 3 was able to react
[3166.90 → 3167.72] with a speed bump
[3167.72 → 3168.58] this quickly,
[3168.76 → 3169.98] is there another one in there?
[3170.70 → 3171.58] It's USB.
[3171.90 → 3172.68] They move pretty quick.
[3173.68 → 3173.88] I mean,
[3173.90 → 3174.22] they were,
[3174.28 → 3175.68] they were slow with USB 2.
[3175.76 → 3177.04] That kind of stuck around forever.
[3177.38 → 3178.62] But USB 2 was kind of
[3178.62 → 3179.38] that golden medium
[3179.38 → 3180.12] at the same time.
[3180.28 → 3181.06] Everyone loved it.
[3181.52 → 3182.06] It was cheap.
[3182.06 → 3182.40] And it won.
[3183.12 → 3184.16] And it just kind of hung out.
[3184.38 → 3185.04] I still wish
[3185.04 → 3186.84] every keyboard was PS2 though.
[3187.74 → 3188.18] Yeah.
[3188.42 → 3189.24] I wish every board
[3189.24 → 3190.54] had like 100%.
[3190.54 → 3191.94] I couldn't be more with you
[3191.94 → 3192.26] on that one.
[3192.28 → 3193.02] It needs to be PS2.
[3193.26 → 3193.94] Oh my goodness.
[3194.52 → 3195.68] 27 and 30 inch
[3195.68 → 3196.64] mono price monitors
[3196.64 → 3197.42] are a good value.
[3197.68 → 3199.16] They're basically just like,
[3199.46 → 3200.58] you know,
[3200.64 → 3201.76] North American QC
[3201.76 → 3203.36] on those cheapo Korean panels.
[3204.02 → 3205.46] 100 watts over USB.
[3206.04 → 3206.38] Wow.
[3207.24 → 3207.72] Fascinating.
[3208.48 → 3209.62] Hadn't heard about that yet.
[3210.88 → 3211.20] Cool.
[3211.82 → 3213.36] So you're not only
[3213.36 → 3214.02] going to be able
[3214.02 → 3215.32] to transfer massive data
[3215.32 → 3215.98] over USB,
[3216.12 → 3216.82] but you're going to be able
[3216.82 → 3218.16] to like to keep your drink warm.
[3218.16 → 3219.76] That's actually pretty crazy.
[3220.56 → 3221.68] TP-Link products.
[3222.46 → 3225.22] I've never really gotten into it
[3225.22 → 3226.20] to be perfectly honest.
[3226.28 → 3227.20] I've never actually
[3227.20 → 3228.18] held one in my hands
[3228.18 → 3230.34] unless I unboxed one once.
[3230.34 → 3230.36] I have.
[3230.36 → 3231.52] I'm pretty sure we have.
[3231.82 → 3232.20] Did we?
[3232.34 → 3232.52] Okay.
[3232.58 → 3233.36] I know I have,
[3233.46 → 3234.56] but it was outside of work.
[3234.66 → 3235.28] Inside of work,
[3235.34 → 3236.46] I think we have at least once.
[3236.50 → 3237.42] Not memorable then.
[3238.54 → 3239.16] Will we ever see
[3239.16 → 3239.82] external graphics
[3239.82 → 3240.28] through Thunderbolt?
[3240.40 → 3240.78] Yes.
[3241.10 → 3242.34] So that's an application
[3242.34 → 3243.48] where it could be a big deal.
[3243.72 → 3244.16] Do we still,
[3244.22 → 3244.82] no we don't still have that.
[3244.82 → 3245.76] No, I sent it back.
[3245.90 → 3246.10] Okay.
[3246.34 → 3247.66] We had a magma enclosure,
[3247.82 → 3248.34] but it's not,
[3248.48 → 3249.74] the drivers are not enabled
[3249.74 → 3251.08] by AMD and NVIDIA yet.
[3251.34 → 3251.90] It'll get there.
[3252.04 → 3253.68] Does get a sound card
[3253.68 → 3255.28] in your,
[3257.34 → 3257.64] no,
[3257.78 → 3258.44] no, of course not.
[3259.72 → 3260.46] Thank you so much
[3260.46 → 3260.90] for the help.
[3261.22 → 3261.82] Before Linus,
[3261.82 → 3263.10] what is one of your
[3263.10 → 3264.12] all-time favourite
[3264.12 → 3264.72] childhood games?
[3264.82 → 3265.36] TIE Fighter,
[3265.64 → 3266.50] Final Fantasy VI.
[3268.32 → 3268.76] Mora wind,
[3268.90 → 3269.34] but I don't know
[3269.34 → 3269.86] if that counts
[3269.86 → 3270.94] as far enough back
[3270.94 → 3271.80] to say childhood.
[3272.12 → 3273.94] So Red Alert 1,
[3274.02 → 3274.48] Red Alert 2,
[3274.58 → 3275.00] Diablo 1,
[3275.08 → 3275.48] Diablo 2.
[3275.90 → 3276.26] Oh yeah,
[3276.34 → 3277.16] and Teenage Mutant,
[3277.24 → 3278.34] Ninja Turtles on NEW.
[3278.62 → 3278.86] Oh,
[3279.06 → 3279.90] that was such a good game.
[3279.96 → 3280.10] Oh,
[3280.10 → 3280.86] that's so good.
[3281.98 → 3283.44] Can you do sound card reviews?
[3283.52 → 3284.14] Not really.
[3284.82 → 3286.30] The problem with sound cards
[3286.30 → 3287.66] is beyond me just saying,
[3287.82 → 3288.28] holy crap,
[3288.36 → 3288.94] this sounds good,
[3288.98 → 3289.24] it's great,
[3289.30 → 3289.80] go buy it.
[3289.80 → 3291.78] There are tons of really,
[3291.98 → 3293.32] really hard to do
[3293.32 → 3294.06] in-depth things
[3294.06 → 3294.72] that you'd have to do
[3294.72 → 3296.06] to actually review it accurately.
[3296.28 → 3296.46] Yeah.
[3296.62 → 3297.14] And it would take
[3297.14 → 3298.42] a huge amount of time.
[3298.44 → 3298.92] Like actually,
[3299.16 → 3300.38] I don't think anyone
[3300.38 → 3301.86] actually has the gear
[3301.86 → 3302.74] to properly do
[3302.74 → 3303.54] a sound card review.
[3304.04 → 3304.70] Where if you were
[3304.70 → 3305.84] taking the
[3305.84 → 3306.26] the sound card review,
[3313.26 → 3314.64] looks like we're live again.
[3314.94 → 3315.38] Yay!
[3316.24 → 3316.76] So,
[3316.92 → 3317.70] I don't know.
[3318.22 → 3318.56] There's,
[3318.56 → 3320.04] it's the universal fix,
[3320.18 → 3320.74] which is,
[3320.82 → 3321.10] sorry,
[3321.18 → 3321.34] sorry,
[3321.34 → 3323.12] a little comedic break.
[3323.56 → 3325.40] One of my forum moderators
[3325.40 → 3327.22] just added a plus side
[3327.22 → 3328.14] to this whole situation
[3328.14 → 3328.56] that,
[3328.84 → 3328.94] well,
[3329.00 → 3329.84] the stream is down,
[3330.28 → 3331.70] the forum's actually up.
[3332.74 → 3333.02] So,
[3333.24 → 3333.74] so,
[3334.16 → 3335.88] yeah!
[3335.88 → 3336.28] Yeah!
[3339.24 → 3339.76] Yes!
[3339.82 → 3340.14] Oh,
[3340.20 → 3340.56] man.
[3340.80 → 3342.12] 0.1 for A team.
[3342.26 → 3342.42] So,
[3342.52 → 3342.82] hopefully,
[3342.94 → 3343.88] it stays up this time.
[3343.96 → 3345.04] It looks like the problem
[3345.04 → 3346.58] was related to us,
[3346.58 → 3347.14] somehow.
[3347.70 → 3348.96] All I did to fix it
[3348.96 → 3350.36] was power cycled the router,
[3350.54 → 3352.60] which reminds me of that
[3352.60 → 3353.54] South Park episode
[3353.54 → 3354.74] where the entire internet
[3354.74 → 3356.28] in all of America
[3356.28 → 3356.98] goes down,
[3357.08 → 3357.80] and it turns out
[3357.80 → 3358.70] that it just needs to be
[3358.70 → 3359.92] unplugged and plugged back in.
[3360.94 → 3361.38] So,
[3361.64 → 3362.46] so there you go.
[3362.96 → 3364.28] Not sure exactly
[3364.28 → 3365.04] what was going on
[3365.04 → 3365.46] because,
[3365.88 → 3366.82] for whatever reason,
[3367.20 → 3368.52] I was able to load
[3368.52 → 3369.78] web pages like YouTube
[3369.78 → 3370.40] and Twitter,
[3370.40 → 3371.28] like I was tweeting
[3371.28 → 3372.44] while our internet
[3372.44 → 3373.82] was out
[3373.82 → 3375.20] and we were not
[3375.20 → 3376.50] able to stream on Twitch.
[3376.64 → 3376.84] So,
[3377.28 → 3377.62] very,
[3377.76 → 3378.22] very bizarre.
[3378.70 → 3379.52] I'm just going to tweet
[3379.52 → 3380.04] that we're,
[3380.04 → 3380.74] we're back up.
[3381.58 → 3381.94] So,
[3382.08 → 3382.78] at least I think
[3382.78 → 3383.40] we're back up.
[3383.46 → 3384.30] We have 12 viewers,
[3384.46 → 3385.62] so all 12 of you
[3385.62 → 3387.10] who hung with us here,
[3387.20 → 3388.02] thank you very much.
[3388.24 → 3388.50] So,
[3388.56 → 3389.06] I want to pick up
[3389.06 → 3389.92] where we left off
[3389.92 → 3391.34] on the Haswell
[3391.34 → 3393.74] integration of the RM
[3393.74 → 3394.44] into the CPU.
[3394.88 → 3395.08] So,
[3395.22 → 3395.94] it used to be
[3395.94 → 3397.44] that motherboard manufacturers
[3397.44 → 3399.26] could differentiate themselves
[3399.26 → 3400.04] both in terms of
[3400.04 → 3400.70] keeping out
[3400.70 → 3401.86] on voltage regulation
[3401.86 → 3403.06] and
[3403.06 → 3403.82] in terms of putting
[3403.82 → 3405.50] really premium voltage regulation
[3405.50 → 3406.50] on their high-end boards
[3406.50 → 3406.84] because
[3406.84 → 3408.16] the more stable
[3408.16 → 3409.24] the voltage you can deliver
[3409.24 → 3409.98] to the CPU,
[3410.38 → 3412.52] the better the overclocking experience
[3412.52 → 3414.70] because you're able
[3414.70 → 3416.54] to reach those higher frequencies
[3416.54 → 3418.04] and not have it just,
[3418.22 → 3418.36] like,
[3418.72 → 3419.38] freak out
[3419.38 → 3419.52] and,
[3419.70 → 3420.06] I mean,
[3420.10 → 3421.40] especially burn out over time.
[3421.92 → 3422.22] So,
[3422.40 → 3422.66] by,
[3422.84 → 3424.06] by putting this
[3424.06 → 3424.74] on the CPU,
[3425.00 → 3426.10] Intel's done a couple of things.
[3426.18 → 3426.60] The number one
[3426.60 → 3427.54] is they've prevented
[3427.54 → 3430.28] cheapo motherboard manufacturers
[3430.28 → 3431.24] from making
[3431.24 → 3432.30] their,
[3432.30 → 3434.00] their CPUs look unstable
[3434.00 → 3434.66] and crappy
[3434.66 → 3436.38] by not building
[3436.38 → 3437.08] a good enough board
[3437.08 → 3437.70] to go with it,
[3437.78 → 3439.10] but they've also removed
[3439.10 → 3439.66] the ability
[3439.66 → 3440.86] of motherboard manufacturers
[3440.86 → 3441.66] to differentiate
[3441.66 → 3442.52] from each other
[3442.52 → 3444.10] in yet another way.
[3444.60 → 3445.96] What's actually left?
[3446.44 → 3446.98] What will,
[3447.16 → 3448.60] what will Gigabyte
[3448.60 → 3449.52] or Asus
[3449.52 → 3450.60] or MSI
[3450.60 → 3451.22] or some premium
[3451.22 → 3452.58] motherboard manufacturer
[3452.58 → 3453.04] do
[3453.04 → 3454.76] to make their board premium?
[3455.06 → 3455.48] We've got,
[3455.58 → 3455.82] like,
[3456.64 → 3457.58] built-in Wi-Fi,
[3457.88 → 3458.58] which is already,
[3458.58 → 3458.86] like,
[3458.94 → 3459.40] pretty niche
[3459.40 → 3460.26] on a desktop motherboard.
[3460.38 → 3461.22] They can't change
[3461.22 → 3462.22] RAM performance.
[3463.50 → 3463.90] Oh,
[3464.00 → 3464.22] oh,
[3464.30 → 3464.54] okay.
[3464.68 → 3464.84] What,
[3464.98 → 3466.52] that's weird.
[3466.72 → 3467.22] You asked me
[3467.22 → 3468.12] what they could do.
[3468.20 → 3468.68] Let's say,
[3468.76 → 3468.92] okay,
[3469.00 → 3470.04] let's take all the
[3470.14 → 3470.42] well,
[3470.88 → 3471.28] okay,
[3471.36 → 3472.10] what they could do
[3472.10 → 3472.60] was going to be
[3472.60 → 3473.44] a very short list,
[3473.52 → 3474.40] so I was going to go
[3474.40 → 3475.60] with what they can't do.
[3475.60 → 3477.28] So they can't change
[3477.28 → 3478.04] RAM performance
[3478.04 → 3478.98] because it's all
[3478.98 → 3479.94] on the IMC.
[3480.28 → 3481.32] They can't change
[3481.32 → 3482.18] graphics performance
[3482.18 → 3483.52] because the only thing
[3483.52 → 3484.64] they can do now even
[3484.64 → 3484.86] is,
[3485.02 → 3485.24] on board.
[3485.70 → 3486.04] Is,
[3486.20 → 3486.58] um,
[3486.80 → 3487.00] what?
[3487.42 → 3487.82] They can't,
[3487.82 → 3488.46] they can't change
[3488.46 → 3489.16] graphics performance
[3489.16 → 3489.50] in general.
[3489.58 → 3490.14] What are they going to do?
[3490.26 → 3490.40] Yeah,
[3490.46 → 3490.80] but like,
[3490.92 → 3491.94] they can put more PLX
[3491.94 → 3492.96] splitter chips on,
[3493.04 → 3493.14] go,
[3493.38 → 3493.40] oh,
[3493.46 → 3496.20] we have four-way 16X,
[3496.24 → 3497.24] but really what they're doing
[3497.24 → 3498.26] is they're taking those
[3498.26 → 3499.32] two 8X
[3499.32 → 3499.88] and they're just
[3499.88 → 3500.88] splitting them.
[3501.00 → 3501.62] Which is brutal.
[3501.62 → 3503.92] Which is not actually
[3503.92 → 3505.16] increasing the bandwidth.
[3506.28 → 3507.46] Just so you know.
[3508.32 → 3509.10] It's really,
[3509.30 → 3510.82] it's kind of not that good.
[3511.06 → 3512.38] It's like if you have,
[3512.44 → 3513.00] like a
[3513.16 → 3514.28] it's like if you have a funnel
[3514.28 → 3516.10] and you turn it upside down.
[3516.56 → 3516.84] It's like,
[3516.90 → 3517.02] yeah,
[3517.04 → 3518.04] it's really wide here,
[3518.24 → 3519.56] but you can only get
[3519.56 → 3520.82] this much water through it,
[3520.86 → 3521.70] so who cares?
[3522.16 → 3523.32] And it actually increases
[3523.32 → 3524.18] latencies as well.
[3524.34 → 3525.46] So they can't differentiate
[3525.46 → 3526.56] on graphics performance.
[3526.88 → 3527.92] They can't differentiate
[3527.92 → 3529.42] on overclocking anymore.
[3529.70 → 3530.28] Which is
[3530.28 → 3531.94] brutal.
[3532.10 → 3532.74] Which is about all
[3532.74 → 3533.00] that's left right now.
[3533.00 → 3533.90] Because the biggest thing
[3533.90 → 3534.42] has been like
[3534.42 → 3536.32] overclocking motherboards.
[3536.96 → 3537.56] Now it's just going to
[3537.56 → 3538.36] turn it into like
[3538.36 → 3539.34] lifestyle motherboards.
[3539.50 → 3540.46] They can't differentiate
[3540.46 → 3542.18] on I.O. really
[3542.18 → 3543.14] because
[3543.14 → 3544.68] Wi-Fi,
[3544.84 → 3545.62] Wi-Fi Bluetooth.
[3546.46 → 3547.10] Which like
[3547.10 → 3548.22] everyone's going to do it now
[3548.22 → 3549.50] because it's one of the few
[3549.50 → 3550.02] things you can do
[3550.02 → 3551.12] to make a premium motherboard.
[3552.48 → 3552.92] And
[3552.92 → 3553.98] what else is there?
[3554.70 → 3555.30] Wi-Fi Bluetooth.
[3555.90 → 3556.30] Thunderbolt.
[3556.84 → 3557.14] Duh,
[3557.28 → 3557.74] Thunderbolt.
[3559.16 → 3559.90] Really nice
[3559.90 → 3560.50] built-in sound.
[3560.70 → 3561.58] USB 3s
[3561.58 → 3562.64] still is built
[3562.64 → 3563.52] into the new chipset.
[3563.72 → 3564.30] So they don't even
[3564.30 → 3564.96] get to differentiate
[3564.96 → 3565.56] by being like
[3565.56 → 3567.18] we have lots of USB 3.
[3568.12 → 3568.78] What do you think
[3568.78 → 3569.50] is going to be next?
[3569.62 → 3570.12] I kind of think
[3570.12 → 3570.72] it might be sound.
[3571.60 → 3571.96] Sound?
[3572.54 → 3573.24] You know what?
[3573.32 → 3574.58] The problem with sound
[3574.58 → 3575.90] is that most people
[3575.90 → 3576.78] don't even get it.
[3576.98 → 3577.64] They don't even
[3577.64 → 3578.30] appreciate it.
[3579.02 → 3579.92] They don't even know
[3579.92 → 3580.18] they need it.
[3580.18 → 3580.90] Yeah, but what else
[3580.90 → 3581.14] is there?
[3581.20 → 3581.76] They're going to take
[3581.76 → 3582.44] another thing off
[3582.44 → 3583.22] on the next generation.
[3583.22 → 3586.50] Honestly though,
[3586.54 → 3587.80] MSI's gaming motherboards
[3587.80 → 3589.22] have E2200
[3589.22 → 3590.20] Killer Nick Gaming.
[3592.24 → 3593.42] I'm still not convinced
[3593.42 → 3594.02] it does anything.
[3594.82 → 3596.24] I like Intel LAN.
[3596.36 → 3597.48] Intel LAN's solid.
[3599.28 → 3599.76] Yeah,
[3600.14 → 3600.84] it kind of is.
[3601.28 → 3601.50] So,
[3602.12 → 3602.66] I mean,
[3602.74 → 3603.38] colour schemes
[3603.38 → 3604.58] would actually still
[3604.58 → 3605.84] sway my buying decision.
[3606.60 → 3607.00] Sales teams
[3607.00 → 3607.80] could totally do it.
[3608.02 → 3608.04] Like,
[3608.18 → 3609.74] that one's not it.
[3609.78 → 3610.40] That one's on a bench.
[3610.66 → 3610.96] Dang.
[3610.96 → 3612.78] the ASUS DOG logo
[3612.78 → 3613.56] that can like breathe
[3613.56 → 3614.02] and stuff.
[3614.18 → 3614.30] Yeah,
[3614.40 → 3615.16] that's cool.
[3615.36 → 3615.90] Lighting effects.
[3616.04 → 3616.78] The lighting effect
[3616.78 → 3618.32] on that motherboard
[3618.32 → 3619.24] where it kind of like
[3619.24 → 3619.92] looks as if
[3619.92 → 3620.84] the one corner's like
[3620.84 → 3621.60] cracked where the
[3621.60 → 3622.38] sound section is.
[3622.50 → 3622.54] Like,
[3622.60 → 3623.08] that's cool.
[3623.20 → 3624.30] Someone needs to bring back
[3624.30 → 3625.62] UV reactive motherboards
[3625.62 → 3626.06] as well.
[3626.16 → 3626.82] That would be like
[3626.82 → 3627.32] balling.
[3627.44 → 3628.04] MSI should come up
[3628.04 → 3628.94] with a rainbow board again.
[3629.08 → 3629.48] And you know what
[3629.48 → 3630.40] the funny thing is?
[3630.46 → 3631.70] Is they're going to have
[3631.70 → 3633.42] all this extra space
[3633.42 → 3634.18] on the PCB
[3634.18 → 3636.20] where no traces
[3636.20 → 3637.42] are actually routing
[3637.42 → 3639.24] to build in like
[3639.24 → 3640.60] random extra functionality.
[3640.60 → 3642.14] That always looks so awkward.
[3642.42 → 3642.82] I know.
[3643.06 → 3643.90] Some company
[3643.90 → 3644.86] just for jokes
[3644.86 → 3645.42] should just like
[3645.42 → 3646.50] fill it with capacitors
[3646.50 → 3647.14] that go nowhere.
[3648.70 → 3649.10] Like,
[3649.16 → 3650.18] they're not even capacitors.
[3650.36 → 3651.06] They're just like
[3651.06 → 3651.86] shells.
[3652.02 → 3652.14] Like,
[3652.20 → 3652.74] they look like
[3652.74 → 3653.86] little Pepsi cans
[3653.86 → 3654.32] or something.
[3654.88 → 3655.70] It's just like
[3655.70 → 3657.00] MSI could do like
[3657.00 → 3657.70] shell casings.
[3658.00 → 3658.18] Yeah.
[3658.18 → 3658.78] They just have a fake
[3658.78 → 3659.94] pile of shell casings
[3659.94 → 3660.36] in the corner
[3660.36 → 3661.10] that does nothing.
[3661.16 → 3661.26] Like,
[3661.26 → 3661.64] on the board.
[3661.72 → 3661.84] Like,
[3661.88 → 3662.86] it's not a heat sink.
[3663.02 → 3663.36] It's not...
[3663.36 → 3664.32] It's just sitting there.
[3664.34 → 3664.52] Yeah.
[3664.74 → 3665.52] It does nothing.
[3666.22 → 3667.08] That would be fantastic.
[3667.36 → 3668.12] It can light up.
[3668.12 → 3669.32] I mean,
[3669.38 → 3670.36] that's pretty much
[3670.36 → 3671.88] where we're heading though
[3671.88 → 3672.58] because...
[3672.58 → 3673.10] We can bring back
[3673.10 → 3673.94] onboard speakers
[3673.94 → 3674.34] and when you go
[3674.34 → 3675.16] into overclocking mode
[3675.16 → 3675.52] it can like
[3675.52 → 3676.28] rev up or something.
[3676.36 → 3677.16] So here's the thing
[3677.16 → 3677.64] is I mean,
[3677.96 → 3678.54] I don't know
[3678.54 → 3679.68] if I brought this up to you
[3679.68 → 3681.02] but one of Intel's engineers
[3681.02 → 3682.62] didn't ask me anything
[3682.62 → 3683.04] on Reddit.
[3683.24 → 3683.62] Yeah, yeah.
[3683.62 → 3684.96] And what he said
[3684.96 → 3685.96] was that Haswell
[3685.96 → 3687.28] would be an overclocked's delight
[3687.28 → 3688.68] and a lot of people
[3688.68 → 3689.52] interpreted that
[3689.52 → 3690.12] to mean that
[3690.12 → 3691.40] unlike Ivy Bridge
[3691.40 → 3691.98] which really
[3691.98 → 3693.68] because it didn't overclock
[3693.68 → 3694.78] to the same frequencies
[3694.78 → 3695.72] as Sandy Bridge
[3695.72 → 3696.90] about 10% lower
[3696.90 → 3698.98] its 10% improvement
[3698.98 → 3699.82] in IPC
[3699.82 → 3700.70] that is the performance
[3700.70 → 3701.38] per clock
[3701.38 → 3702.62] actually was offset
[3702.62 → 3703.72] making them
[3703.72 → 3704.72] for an overclocked
[3704.72 → 3705.70] perform equally
[3705.70 → 3706.50] so there was no
[3706.50 → 3707.24] performance improvement.
[3707.52 → 3708.32] So what a lot of people
[3708.32 → 3709.64] interpreted this Haswell
[3709.64 → 3710.50] comment to mean
[3710.50 → 3711.52] was that
[3711.52 → 3712.36] Haswell would be
[3712.36 → 3713.42] some kind of beast
[3713.42 → 3714.60] amazing overclocked
[3714.60 → 3715.42] that would bring
[3715.42 → 3716.40] IPC improvements
[3716.40 → 3717.84] and improved frequencies
[3717.84 → 3718.46] and we don't know
[3718.46 → 3719.18] that it won't
[3719.18 → 3720.00] because I don't think
[3720.00 → 3720.98] anyone has their hands
[3720.98 → 3721.56] on anywhere near
[3721.56 → 3722.42] production silicone
[3722.42 → 3723.76] silicon yet
[3723.76 → 3725.68] what we
[3725.68 → 3728.40] what I think he meant
[3728.40 → 3729.36] is that
[3729.36 → 3730.30] Haswell will be
[3730.30 → 3730.90] overclockable
[3730.90 → 3731.60] on any platform
[3731.60 → 3734.24] on any cheapo board
[3734.24 → 3736.24] so all of a sudden
[3736.24 → 3737.76] you can buy
[3737.76 → 3740.42] $119.99 board
[3740.42 → 3741.48] and you'll get
[3741.48 → 3742.80] exactly
[3742.80 → 3744.26] the same performance
[3744.26 → 3744.84] as someone
[3744.84 → 3745.38] who just blew
[3745.38 → 3746.54] $400 on their motherboard
[3746.54 → 3749.10] exactly the same performance
[3749.10 → 3750.40] which is
[3750.40 → 3751.36] just kind of nuts
[3751.36 → 3751.82] you know
[3751.82 → 3753.10] one of the interesting
[3753.10 → 3753.88] value adds
[3753.88 → 3754.26] too
[3754.26 → 3755.94] is that you can
[3755.94 → 3756.90] overclock your computer
[3756.90 → 3758.04] with a mobile device
[3758.04 → 3759.32] and
[3759.32 → 3760.16] they're no longer
[3760.16 → 3760.94] locking down
[3760.94 → 3762.06] base clock overclocking
[3762.06 → 3762.48] the same way
[3762.48 → 3762.98] they used to
[3762.98 → 3763.38] right
[3763.38 → 3763.84] yeah
[3763.84 → 3765.06] what are the new tiers
[3765.06 → 3765.92] 100
[3765.92 → 3766.38] 125
[3766.38 → 3767.84] and 166
[3767.84 → 3768.64] or something like that
[3768.64 → 3769.34] if I recall correctly
[3769.34 → 3770.60] so you're not going to be locked
[3770.60 → 3771.58] because it used to be
[3771.58 → 3773.26] only on unlocked chips
[3773.26 → 3774.58] you could boost up the multi
[3774.58 → 3776.30] now you're going to be able
[3776.30 → 3777.34] to set different
[3777.34 → 3778.26] base clock levels
[3778.26 → 3779.18] in much the same way
[3779.18 → 3780.22] that we used to be able
[3780.22 → 3781.10] to do with
[3781.10 → 3783.52] oh crap
[3783.52 → 3784.50] I can't even remember
[3784.50 → 3785.70] it was like
[3785.70 → 3787.44] hyper transport multi
[3787.44 → 3788.26] or something stupid
[3788.26 → 3788.76] like that
[3788.76 → 3789.58] on AMD chips
[3789.58 → 3790.32] I don't remember
[3790.32 → 3791.10] what it was anymore
[3791.10 → 3791.86] but you could actually
[3791.86 → 3793.16] overclock the system bus
[3793.16 → 3793.96] in some weird way
[3793.96 → 3795.96] but there were different
[3795.96 → 3796.96] actual starts
[3796.96 → 3797.68] oh it's kind of like
[3797.68 → 3798.36] a RAM divider
[3798.36 → 3798.74] there
[3798.74 → 3799.92] so it's
[3799.92 → 3800.82] sort of like
[3800.82 → 3801.66] a RAM divider
[3801.66 → 3801.94] where
[3801.94 → 3803.74] it'll turn up
[3803.74 → 3804.94] with the rest of the system
[3804.94 → 3806.12] but
[3806.12 → 3807.62] you could clock it
[3807.62 → 3808.64] you could bring it back
[3808.64 → 3809.52] and then it would still be
[3809.52 → 3810.28] within threshold
[3810.28 → 3811.60] so I think it's going to be
[3811.60 → 3812.14] kind of like that
[3812.14 → 3813.18] but it remains to be seen
[3813.18 → 3814.02] I haven't actually
[3814.02 → 3815.06] played around with it yet
[3815.06 → 3817.50] so
[3817.50 → 3818.50] so that's
[3818.50 → 3819.64] that's
[3819.64 → 3820.22] exciting
[3820.22 → 3821.04] someone's asking
[3821.04 → 3821.92] why I'm hating
[3821.92 → 3823.38] on my international viewers
[3823.38 → 3824.24] I'm just looking at
[3824.24 → 3824.98] Twitter right now
[3824.98 → 3825.66] I don't know
[3825.66 → 3826.08] what
[3826.08 → 3827.04] I don't know how I hate
[3827.04 → 3827.94] international viewers
[3827.94 → 3829.22] I love international viewers
[3829.22 → 3830.04] you guys are awesome
[3830.04 → 3831.16] we're streaming at a time
[3831.16 → 3831.84] that should be like
[3831.84 → 3832.34] easier
[3832.34 → 3833.82] no actually it's not
[3833.82 → 3834.54] no
[3834.54 → 3835.62] it's like 4 in the morning
[3835.62 → 3836.60] in some parts of Europe
[3836.60 → 3837.90] we're hitting like
[3837.90 → 3838.80] right in the Atlantic Ocean
[3838.80 → 3839.12] aren't we
[3839.12 → 3839.48] yeah
[3839.48 → 3841.12] for like prime time
[3841.12 → 3842.40] prime time is like
[3842.40 → 3843.28] oh no the other way
[3843.28 → 3843.72] there's like
[3843.72 → 3844.92] one dude
[3844.92 → 3846.10] somewhere in the
[3846.10 → 3847.06] on an island
[3847.06 → 3847.94] Japan and Russia
[3847.94 → 3848.56] that's like the
[3848.56 → 3849.42] no even
[3849.42 → 3850.10] even Japan
[3850.10 → 3851.16] is at the same time zone
[3851.16 → 3851.70] as Australia
[3851.70 → 3853.18] oh brutal
[3853.18 → 3854.28] yeah so it's like
[3854.28 → 3855.38] early afternoon
[3855.38 → 3856.74] so we're literally
[3856.74 → 3857.26] hitting like
[3857.26 → 3858.22] on the water
[3858.22 → 3858.62] yes
[3858.62 → 3859.72] god that's bad
[3859.72 → 3860.38] so it's like
[3860.38 → 3861.28] it's like someone's
[3861.28 → 3862.28] watching us at breakfast
[3862.28 → 3863.26] in like
[3863.26 → 3864.48] the Middle East
[3864.48 → 3867.50] and then someone's
[3867.50 → 3868.26] watching us
[3868.26 → 3869.68] at like prime time
[3869.68 → 3870.50] in the middle of the
[3870.50 → 3871.24] Pacific Ocean
[3871.24 → 3872.08] beautiful
[3872.08 → 3872.54] yeah
[3872.54 → 3873.76] we're going to change our time
[3873.76 → 3874.30] at some point
[3874.30 → 3875.92] not even at some point
[3875.92 → 3876.38] we're gonna
[3876.38 → 3877.54] change our stream time
[3877.54 → 3878.02] very soon
[3878.02 → 3878.84] my wife's going back
[3878.84 → 3879.22] to work
[3879.22 → 3880.18] her maternity leave
[3880.18 → 3881.28] is over in a couple
[3881.28 → 3881.74] of weeks
[3881.74 → 3883.58] and her new shift
[3883.58 → 3884.54] schedule is gonna
[3884.54 → 3885.54] have her coming home
[3885.54 → 3886.80] at 9.30 on Friday
[3886.80 → 3887.22] nights
[3887.22 → 3888.14] which means
[3888.14 → 3889.26] Slick and I will not
[3889.26 → 3889.92] be able to start
[3889.92 → 3890.80] streaming at 9 o'clock
[3890.80 → 3891.46] on a Friday night
[3891.46 → 3892.30] because I will have
[3892.30 → 3892.68] the baby
[3892.68 → 3894.80] so we are going to
[3894.80 → 3895.50] move it in the next
[3895.50 → 3896.02] two weeks
[3896.02 → 3896.48] in fact
[3896.48 → 3897.36] you know what we should
[3897.36 → 3897.92] do is we should
[3897.92 → 3898.86] create a forum thread
[3898.86 → 3899.74] we should create a poll
[3899.74 → 3900.22] definitely
[3900.22 → 3901.30] okay we're going to create
[3901.30 → 3902.26] a poll on the forum
[3902.26 → 3903.88] we want you guys to vote
[3903.88 → 3904.96] for what time you want
[3904.96 → 3905.88] us to do the live stream
[3905.88 → 3906.62] we'll come up with
[3906.62 → 3907.36] a couple options
[3907.36 → 3907.88] yeah we'll come up
[3907.88 → 3908.44] with some options
[3908.44 → 3909.88] that actually work for us
[3909.88 → 3910.74] hopefully the poll
[3910.74 → 3911.74] actually works for us
[3911.74 → 3913.40] no no last one did
[3913.40 → 3914.14] okay
[3914.14 → 3914.52] it's all good
[3914.52 → 3915.42] did you add things to it
[3915.42 → 3916.04] did you add more than
[3916.04 → 3916.20] three
[3916.20 → 3916.84] yes tons
[3916.84 → 3917.30] okay
[3917.30 → 3918.02] so it's all good
[3918.02 → 3920.30] but we'd love for you guys
[3920.30 → 3921.38] to help us pick
[3921.38 → 3922.94] the optimal stream time
[3922.94 → 3924.42] so that you guys can
[3924.42 → 3925.28] actually
[3925.28 → 3927.26] actually tune in
[3927.26 → 3928.30] someone asked
[3928.30 → 3929.04] what if Thunderbolt
[3929.04 → 3930.26] is in a dedicated GPU
[3930.26 → 3931.28] it doesn't work that way
[3931.28 → 3932.96] Thunderbolt has to be
[3932.96 → 3934.44] has to be tied in
[3934.44 → 3935.72] very tightly
[3935.72 → 3937.32] to the platform itself
[3937.32 → 3939.80] someone just tweeted at me
[3939.80 → 3941.04] telling me to check chat
[3941.04 → 3941.82] chat
[3941.82 → 3943.06] for us to be able
[3943.06 → 3944.40] it's nearly impossible
[3944.40 → 3944.92] for us to be able
[3944.92 → 3945.56] to check up with chat
[3945.56 → 3946.32] we're not always looking
[3946.32 → 3946.84] at the screens
[3946.84 → 3947.48] we're often looking
[3947.48 → 3947.96] at the camera
[3947.96 → 3949.44] I try to check things
[3949.44 → 3950.40] as often as I can
[3950.40 → 3951.36] but it's mainly for stability
[3951.36 → 3952.04] twitch chat moves
[3952.04 → 3952.84] like this
[3952.84 → 3954.46] it's insanely fast
[3954.46 → 3955.94] if you tell me to check chat
[3955.94 → 3956.66] I have no idea
[3956.66 → 3957.34] what you're talking about
[3957.34 → 3958.54] and I mean we've talked
[3958.54 → 3959.38] about what to do
[3959.38 → 3959.92] about this
[3959.92 → 3960.70] and we don't know
[3960.70 → 3961.78] because slow mode
[3961.78 → 3962.68] everyone hates
[3962.68 → 3964.34] honestly I think slow mode
[3964.34 → 3965.02] is kind of stupid
[3965.02 → 3967.02] it's really slow
[3967.02 → 3967.76] if you actually have
[3967.76 → 3968.40] stuff to say
[3968.40 → 3969.32] it allows for no
[3969.32 → 3970.00] back and forth
[3970.00 → 3970.88] no conversation
[3970.88 → 3972.00] between viewers
[3972.00 → 3973.22] and it's really difficult
[3973.22 → 3974.98] because we still have
[3974.98 → 3976.30] tons of people in the chat
[3976.30 → 3977.58] so it's still going fast
[3977.58 → 3978.36] but now none of the
[3978.36 → 3979.48] conversations make any sense
[3979.48 → 3979.88] yes
[3979.88 → 3982.20] subscriber mode
[3982.20 → 3983.36] once we have a
[3983.36 → 3984.14] subscriber button
[3984.14 → 3985.86] is ridiculous
[3985.86 → 3986.16] because
[3986.16 → 3986.98] I don't like it
[3986.98 → 3988.62] only paying people get it
[3988.62 → 3988.88] yeah
[3988.88 → 3989.88] and we only stream
[3989.88 → 3990.50] once a week
[3990.50 → 3991.64] so if we were asking
[3991.64 → 3992.00] what is it
[3992.00 → 3992.78] five bucks a month
[3992.78 → 3993.80] it's five bucks a month
[3993.80 → 3994.52] and we only stream
[3994.52 → 3995.02] once a week
[3995.02 → 3995.72] which is ridiculous
[3995.72 → 3996.16] already
[3996.16 → 3996.98] so that would basically
[3996.98 → 3997.88] work out to like
[3997.88 → 3999.30] a buck 25 a stream
[3999.30 → 4000.66] which honestly isn't
[4000.66 → 4000.98] that bad
[4000.98 → 4001.56] but like
[4001.56 → 4002.28] but it's for the
[4002.28 → 4003.40] privilege of being able
[4003.40 → 4004.64] to talk to other people
[4004.64 → 4005.66] who paid a buck 25
[4005.66 → 4006.68] to watch the stream
[4006.68 → 4007.60] which is just kind of
[4007.60 → 4007.74] nuts
[4007.74 → 4008.64] so that's not okay
[4008.64 → 4010.26] and then full flowing
[4010.26 → 4011.74] is also not really okay
[4011.74 → 4012.34] not okay
[4012.34 → 4014.68] so my solution is
[4014.68 → 4015.86] guys get off the twitch chat
[4015.86 → 4016.48] and get on Twitter
[4016.48 → 4018.10] because Twitter is manageable
[4018.10 → 4018.94] at least
[4018.94 → 4020.54] at least I can keep on
[4020.54 → 4021.42] reloading my twitter
[4021.42 → 4022.96] and then slowly read through it
[4022.96 → 4023.68] as I look down
[4023.68 → 4025.26] it's a lot easier to deal with
[4025.26 → 4026.64] like I can go like this
[4026.64 → 4027.16] and I can go
[4027.16 → 4029.48] okay here's some of the twitter stuff
[4029.48 → 4030.48] here's the most relevant
[4030.48 → 4031.90] it gives me a time stamp
[4031.90 → 4032.72] so I can actually
[4032.72 → 4033.98] it doesn't move
[4033.98 → 4035.18] as I'm trying to read it
[4035.18 → 4035.94] which is really nice
[4035.94 → 4036.46] so guys
[4036.46 → 4038.10] however much you might
[4038.10 → 4040.34] oh I don't use Twitter
[4040.34 → 4042.56] because celebrities use Twitter
[4042.56 → 4043.70] or whatever reason you have
[4043.70 → 4044.26] for not doing
[4044.26 → 4044.86] using Twitter
[4044.86 → 4045.72] get over it
[4045.72 → 4047.52] because it's actually useful
[4047.52 → 4049.52] follow like two people
[4049.52 → 4050.58] and just log into it
[4050.58 → 4051.04] on Fridays
[4051.04 → 4052.10] for an hour and a half
[4052.10 → 4054.30] use it for nothing else
[4054.30 → 4056.10] that's fine
[4056.10 → 4057.94] use it for nothing else
[4057.94 → 4059.08] I actually don't care
[4059.08 → 4059.60] you don't even have to
[4059.60 → 4060.16] follow us
[4060.16 → 4060.90] just tweet at us
[4060.90 → 4061.74] I have a lot of people
[4061.74 → 4062.30] that are like
[4062.30 → 4063.30] oh I wish I
[4063.30 → 4064.04] you know what's funny
[4064.04 → 4064.78] is on my Facebook
[4064.78 → 4066.70] it says don't message me here
[4066.70 → 4067.28] I have a hundred
[4067.28 → 4068.72] unread messages
[4068.72 → 4069.38] in my inbox
[4069.38 → 4069.82] that are from like
[4069.82 → 4070.48] the last few weeks
[4070.48 → 4072.54] it says don't message me here
[4072.54 → 4073.84] message me on Twitter
[4073.84 → 4075.24] I don't check these messages
[4075.24 → 4077.22] I get messages from people
[4077.22 → 4077.84] that say
[4077.84 → 4079.90] I know it says
[4079.90 → 4081.02] not to message you here
[4081.02 → 4081.76] but I don't have
[4081.76 → 4082.42] a Twitter account
[4082.42 → 4082.94] so this
[4082.94 → 4084.20] and I'm like
[4084.20 → 4085.18] wow
[4085.18 → 4086.54] just wow
[4086.54 → 4088.00] twitter is free
[4088.00 → 4090.22] if it's actually
[4090.22 → 4091.40] if you actually
[4091.40 → 4092.30] want a response
[4092.30 → 4093.28] actually following
[4093.28 → 4094.10] the instructions
[4094.10 → 4094.64] that I give
[4094.64 → 4095.66] is probably helpful
[4095.66 → 4096.56] so
[4096.56 → 4098.30] some guy just tweeted me
[4098.30 → 4099.18] why don't you use
[4099.18 → 4099.70] tweet deck
[4099.70 → 4100.40] adjustable columns
[4100.40 → 4101.28] make it easier to monitor
[4101.28 → 4101.98] we're not complaining
[4101.98 → 4102.66] about Twitter being
[4102.66 → 4103.72] easy to monitor man
[4103.72 → 4104.62] yeah twitter is easy
[4104.62 → 4105.02] to monitor
[4105.02 → 4105.66] we like it
[4105.66 → 4106.12] we're complaining
[4106.12 → 4106.82] about twitch chat
[4106.82 → 4107.24] it's good
[4107.24 → 4108.20] um okay
[4108.20 → 4109.48] so won't power features
[4109.48 → 4110.30] play a big part
[4110.30 → 4110.90] for Haswell boards
[4110.90 → 4111.42] and overclocking
[4111.42 → 4112.12] absolutely not
[4112.12 → 4113.14] because power is now
[4113.14 → 4113.68] on the chip
[4113.68 → 4115.68] will a 65 watt
[4115.68 → 4116.90] Cameron or a Pentium
[4116.90 → 4118.32] get as hot as a 65 watt
[4118.32 → 4119.12] core i3 at full load
[4119.12 → 4120.02] it really depends
[4120.02 → 4120.52] I mean
[4120.52 → 4121.64] TDP is one of those
[4121.64 → 4122.18] things that's been
[4122.18 → 4122.88] measured a billion
[4122.88 → 4123.54] different ways
[4123.54 → 4124.46] by a billion different
[4124.46 → 4124.96] companies
[4124.96 → 4126.04] at every different
[4126.04 → 4126.68] point in time
[4126.68 → 4127.62] because it's all about
[4127.62 → 4128.38] how they want to
[4128.38 → 4129.10] present the data
[4129.10 → 4130.50] there were Prescott
[4130.50 → 4131.46] CPUs
[4131.46 → 4132.56] that kicked out
[4132.56 → 4133.76] a lot of heat
[4133.76 → 4135.82] and were rated at
[4135.82 → 4136.76] this GDP
[4136.76 → 4137.76] because
[4137.76 → 4138.46] that's
[4138.46 → 4139.22] whenever you talk
[4139.22 → 4139.44] about
[4139.44 → 4140.04] whenever anyone
[4140.04 → 4140.54] talks about
[4140.54 → 4142.54] for some reason
[4142.54 → 4143.60] that series of CPUs
[4143.60 → 4143.90] I always
[4143.90 → 4144.88] whenever I hear the
[4144.88 → 4145.50] name I always think
[4145.50 → 4145.80] of like
[4145.80 → 4146.72] an old man
[4146.72 → 4147.20] in a suit
[4147.20 → 4149.04] it was named
[4149.04 → 4149.78] after some kind
[4149.78 → 4150.28] of like
[4150.28 → 4151.54] war dude
[4151.54 → 4151.94] or something
[4151.94 → 4154.16] apparently
[4154.16 → 4154.64] was like
[4154.64 → 4155.36] a bad dude
[4155.36 → 4156.06] if I recall
[4156.06 → 4156.52] correctly
[4156.52 → 4156.82] yeah
[4156.82 → 4157.82] it wasn't a good
[4157.82 → 4158.08] thing
[4158.08 → 4158.56] I remember
[4158.56 → 4159.06] it was off
[4159.06 → 4159.42] some
[4159.42 → 4159.90] yeah
[4159.90 → 4160.58] but yeah
[4160.58 → 4161.00] anyway
[4161.00 → 4161.78] apparently
[4161.78 → 4162.24] it's breakfast
[4162.24 → 4163.10] time in Denmark
[4163.10 → 4163.96] awesome
[4163.96 → 4164.52] Denmark
[4164.52 → 4165.22] it's like
[4165.22 → 4166.16] sad badminton
[4166.16 → 4166.96] news all over
[4166.96 → 4167.54] the place
[4167.54 → 4168.52] Peter Data
[4168.52 → 4169.44] retired not that
[4169.44 → 4169.90] long ago
[4169.90 → 4170.34] and I saw
[4170.34 → 4171.02] he was doing
[4171.02 → 4171.84] training
[4171.84 → 4173.08] for
[4173.08 → 4173.98] what's your
[4173.98 → 4175.06] name's
[4175.06 → 4176.28] farewell match
[4176.28 → 4176.66] as well
[4176.66 → 4177.10] so one of
[4177.10 → 4177.58] their premier
[4177.58 → 4178.52] lady players
[4178.52 → 4179.54] is retiring
[4179.54 → 4180.00] as well
[4180.00 → 4180.78] and there's
[4180.78 → 4180.98] like
[4180.98 → 4182.16] not that
[4182.16 → 4182.50] they have
[4182.50 → 4182.90] a doubles
[4182.90 → 4183.18] pair
[4183.18 → 4183.62] that's
[4183.62 → 4184.56] sort of
[4184.56 → 4185.34] performed
[4185.34 → 4185.80] really well
[4185.80 → 4186.28] at the Olympics
[4186.28 → 4186.96] and is fairly
[4186.96 → 4187.38] well regarded
[4187.38 → 4187.94] you don't care
[4187.94 → 4189.84] no idea
[4189.84 → 4190.44] yay
[4190.44 → 4191.08] Denmark
[4191.08 → 4191.92] badminton
[4191.92 → 4193.78] 6am in Ireland
[4193.78 → 4194.82] okay that's
[4194.82 → 4195.32] pretty early
[4195.32 → 4195.88] for breakfast
[4195.88 → 4196.40] I don't eat
[4196.40 → 4197.40] breakfast at 6am
[4197.40 → 4198.02] I'm sleeping
[4198.02 → 4198.70] screw that
[4198.70 → 4199.82] probably just
[4199.82 → 4200.34] actually you're
[4200.34 → 4201.86] probably not
[4201.86 → 4202.74] asleep yet
[4202.74 → 4204.94] actually I've
[4204.94 → 4205.34] seen like
[4205.34 → 4205.88] two videos
[4205.88 → 4206.56] from the slo-mo
[4206.56 → 4206.92] guys
[4206.92 → 4208.56] oh my
[4208.56 → 4209.18] gosh
[4209.18 → 4210.72] oh crap
[4210.72 → 4211.14] I can't
[4211.14 → 4211.58] remember the
[4211.58 → 4211.94] name of the
[4211.94 → 4212.30] company
[4212.30 → 4213.10] phantom
[4213.10 → 4214.16] phantom
[4214.16 → 4214.84] cameras
[4214.84 → 4215.84] they have a
[4215.84 → 4216.56] 4k
[4216.56 → 4217.94] thousand fps
[4217.94 → 4218.58] camera
[4218.58 → 4219.14] what
[4219.14 → 4219.48] that they
[4219.48 → 4219.92] were showing
[4219.92 → 4220.32] off
[4220.32 → 4221.44] how much
[4221.44 → 4222.02] does that
[4222.02 → 4222.54] cost
[4222.54 → 4222.86] oh
[4222.86 → 4224.34] 160 grand
[4224.34 → 4227.58] my goodness
[4227.58 → 4228.38] what I
[4228.38 → 4228.92] wouldn't
[4228.92 → 4229.26] give
[4229.26 → 4229.94] like
[4229.94 → 4230.72] if I could
[4230.72 → 4231.22] if I could
[4231.22 → 4231.78] give up a
[4231.78 → 4232.36] part of my
[4232.36 → 4232.80] body
[4232.80 → 4233.62] to have
[4233.62 → 4233.92] one of
[4233.92 → 4234.18] those
[4234.18 → 4236.26] I wonder
[4236.26 → 4236.62] what it
[4236.62 → 4237.16] would be
[4237.16 → 4238.24] if you
[4238.24 → 4238.54] could give
[4238.54 → 4238.68] up
[4238.68 → 4239.40] what would
[4239.40 → 4239.70] you give
[4239.70 → 4239.84] up
[4239.84 → 4240.26] yeah
[4240.26 → 4241.22] like what's
[4241.22 → 4241.68] the most
[4241.68 → 4242.02] that you'd
[4242.02 → 4242.36] be okay
[4242.36 → 4242.68] you know
[4242.68 → 4242.92] what
[4242.92 → 4244.06] if I
[4244.06 → 4244.60] personally
[4244.60 → 4245.44] nothing
[4245.44 → 4246.42] not interested
[4246.42 → 4246.80] I would
[4246.80 → 4247.06] give a
[4247.06 → 4247.30] single
[4247.30 → 4247.82] testicle
[4247.82 → 4252.28] what
[4252.28 → 4253.22] you only
[4253.22 → 4253.48] need
[4253.48 → 4254.70] one
[4254.70 → 4257.08] I
[4257.08 → 4261.36] would
[4261.36 → 4261.52] give
[4261.52 → 4261.64] a
[4261.64 → 4261.88] kidney
[4261.88 → 4262.26] there
[4262.26 → 4262.72] a
[4262.72 → 4262.98] kidney
[4262.98 → 4263.36] yeah
[4263.36 → 4263.66] you'd
[4263.66 → 4263.82] give
[4263.82 → 4263.96] a
[4263.96 → 4264.20] kidney
[4264.20 → 4264.50] over
[4264.50 → 4264.70] a
[4264.70 → 4265.20] testicle
[4265.20 → 4265.82] yes
[4265.82 → 4266.58] why
[4266.58 → 4266.88] because you
[4266.88 → 4267.18] don't need
[4267.18 → 4267.36] both
[4267.36 → 4267.48] your
[4267.48 → 4267.76] kidneys
[4267.76 → 4268.18] but you
[4268.18 → 4268.66] actually
[4268.66 → 4269.08] don't need
[4269.08 → 4269.28] both
[4269.28 → 4269.50] of your
[4269.50 → 4270.02] testicles
[4270.02 → 4270.68] I'd
[4270.68 → 4271.14] rather give
[4271.14 → 4271.26] up
[4271.26 → 4271.40] one
[4271.40 → 4271.54] of my
[4271.54 → 4271.80] kidneys
[4271.80 → 4272.36] why
[4272.36 → 4272.76] I don't
[4272.76 → 4272.88] know
[4272.88 → 4273.02] it's
[4273.02 → 4273.14] just
[4273.14 → 4273.46] weird
[4273.46 → 4274.20] because
[4274.20 → 4274.38] a
[4274.38 → 4274.70] kidney
[4274.70 → 4275.06] okay
[4275.06 → 4275.58] the thing
[4275.58 → 4275.74] about
[4275.74 → 4275.92] a
[4275.92 → 4276.18] kidney
[4276.18 → 4276.72] is
[4276.72 → 4276.86] if
[4276.86 → 4277.00] your
[4277.00 → 4277.18] other
[4277.18 → 4277.50] kidney
[4277.50 → 4278.00] fails
[4278.00 → 4278.74] then
[4278.74 → 4278.86] you
[4278.86 → 4279.08] only
[4279.08 → 4279.48] have
[4279.48 → 4279.84] one
[4279.84 → 4279.96] and
[4279.96 → 4280.08] you're
[4280.08 → 4280.18] going
[4280.18 → 4280.42] die
[4280.42 → 4280.76] unless
[4280.76 → 4281.50] you
[4281.50 → 4281.84] get
[4281.84 → 4282.74] a
[4282.74 → 4283.10] donor
[4283.10 → 4283.64] whereas
[4283.64 → 4283.84] a
[4283.84 → 4284.36] testicle
[4284.36 → 4284.64] if
[4284.64 → 4284.78] your
[4284.78 → 4284.96] other
[4284.96 → 4285.46] testicle
[4285.46 → 4286.04] fails
[4286.04 → 4286.80] your
[4286.80 → 4287.34] hypothetical
[4287.34 → 4287.98] children
[4287.98 → 4289.06] that
[4289.06 → 4289.88] you
[4289.88 → 4290.26] now
[4290.26 → 4290.48] don't
[4290.48 → 4290.64] have
[4290.64 → 4290.76] to
[4290.76 → 4290.96] worry
[4290.96 → 4291.36] about
[4291.36 → 4292.52] no one
[4292.52 → 4292.64] will
[4292.64 → 4293.38] care
[4293.38 → 4293.74] and
[4293.74 → 4294.02] no one
[4294.02 → 4294.48] will die
[4294.48 → 4295.42] I just
[4295.42 → 4295.84] I just
[4295.84 → 4297.66] people
[4297.66 → 4297.92] with
[4297.92 → 4298.32] knives
[4298.32 → 4298.72] can just
[4298.72 → 4299.28] stay away
[4299.28 → 4299.58] from that
[4299.58 → 4299.88] area
[4299.88 → 4300.32] that's
[4300.32 → 4300.82] that's
[4300.82 → 4301.86] nope
[4301.86 → 4302.38] just
[4302.38 → 4303.14] go away
[4303.14 → 4303.86] that's
[4303.86 → 4304.22] all I have
[4304.22 → 4304.58] to say
[4304.58 → 4305.12] I just
[4305.12 → 4305.56] no
[4305.56 → 4306.00] just leave
[4306.00 → 4306.30] that part
[4306.30 → 4306.44] of me
[4306.44 → 4306.76] alone
[4306.76 → 4307.76] huh
[4307.76 → 4308.14] he's
[4308.14 → 4308.48] good
[4308.48 → 4309.58] everybody
[4309.58 → 4309.78] else
[4309.78 → 4309.90] is
[4309.90 → 4310.20] good
[4310.20 → 4312.62] that's
[4312.62 → 4312.94] very
[4312.94 → 4313.50] interesting
[4313.50 → 4316.20] that's
[4316.20 → 4316.68] just
[4316.68 → 4317.34] oh
[4317.34 → 4317.52] but
[4317.52 → 4318.24] I mean
[4318.24 → 4318.54] kidneys
[4318.54 → 4319.20] are useful
[4319.20 → 4319.70] they actually
[4319.70 → 4320.42] do stuff
[4320.42 → 4321.52] yeah
[4321.52 → 4322.18] yeah
[4322.18 → 4322.74] like they
[4322.74 → 4323.18] filtered
[4323.18 → 4323.52] like
[4323.52 → 4324.26] you know
[4324.26 → 4324.74] bad
[4324.74 → 4325.26] things
[4325.26 → 4325.88] from your
[4325.88 → 4326.16] pee
[4326.16 → 4328.94] two is
[4328.94 → 4329.42] better than
[4329.42 → 4329.62] one
[4329.62 → 4330.18] you know what I would do too
[4330.18 → 4331.26] after I gave one away
[4331.26 → 4332.08] just sell the camera
[4332.08 → 4333.46] just sell the camera
[4333.46 → 4334.66] so you're saying
[4334.66 → 4335.28] okay, okay
[4335.28 → 4336.06] so hold on a second
[4336.06 → 4336.56] you're saying
[4336.56 → 4337.10] you would put
[4337.10 → 4337.80] so you'd put
[4337.80 → 4338.96] a cash money price
[4338.96 → 4339.56] okay
[4339.56 → 4340.12] well okay
[4340.12 → 4340.98] this doesn't work
[4340.98 → 4342.58] if you're only looking at it as cash
[4342.58 → 4344.46] the idea is that the phantom
[4344.46 → 4345.72] thousand fps camera
[4345.72 → 4347.24] has some intrinsic value to me
[4347.24 → 4349.06] because it's this super high-end piece of kit
[4349.06 → 4350.68] that you could do really crazy cool stuff with
[4350.68 → 4351.98] okay how about this
[4351.98 → 4353.24] um
[4353.24 → 4356.40] if you could have
[4356.40 → 4357.38] let's see
[4357.38 → 4359.52] what's like something that you really care about
[4359.52 → 4363.04] if you could
[4363.04 → 4364.10] I don't know
[4364.10 → 4367.82] apprentice under Gabe Newell
[4367.82 → 4369.76] for the rest of his career or something
[4369.76 → 4370.72] oh
[4370.72 → 4373.86] like you could just kind of follow him around every day
[4373.86 → 4375.00] he might not even talk to you
[4375.00 → 4376.40] but you just get to kind of hang with him
[4376.40 → 4377.82] okay fine
[4377.82 → 4378.70] he talks to you
[4378.70 → 4381.18] okay am I apprenticing under Gabe Newell
[4381.18 → 4382.90] or am I sheepishly following around
[4382.90 → 4384.54] a little from column A
[4384.54 → 4385.48] a little from column B
[4385.48 → 4385.98] going you
[4385.98 → 4387.04] what
[4387.04 → 4389.36] how does that even make any sense
[4389.36 → 4390.32] okay, okay
[4390.32 → 4391.28] you're you're uh
[4391.28 → 4392.48] okay fine let's say not forever
[4392.48 → 4393.14] let's say a year
[4393.14 → 4394.10] oh
[4394.10 → 4395.86] a year is a lot
[4395.86 → 4397.46] but he actually gives you attention
[4397.46 → 4398.60] if he had like
[4398.60 → 4399.60] and like tries to
[4399.60 → 4400.50] teach me and train me
[4400.50 → 4401.44] and like pass on with
[4401.44 → 4401.88] testicle
[4401.88 → 4403.32] probably
[4403.32 → 4406.84] that would be so cool
[4406.84 → 4411.80] I would have to buy like the most experimental no sleep drugs ever
[4411.80 → 4415.12] just so that I could just not sleep for a year
[4415.12 → 4417.08] and just absorb all possible information
[4417.08 → 4419.78] and then try to get a job at Valve
[4419.78 → 4424.30] because like what else do you do at that point
[4424.30 → 4425.40] okay so same thing
[4425.40 → 4426.04] okay fine
[4426.04 → 4427.32] without the Gabe Newell apprenticeship
[4427.32 → 4428.92] let's say you don't even get to talk to Gabe
[4428.92 → 4430.32] but you get to work at Valve
[4430.32 → 4431.06] testicle
[4431.06 → 4432.54] very possibly
[4432.54 → 4434.42] that company is just a cool company
[4434.42 → 4437.00] and like just so awesome
[4437.00 → 4438.38] that is a very cool company
[4438.38 → 4440.50] honestly I don't want kids
[4440.50 → 4443.30] so realistically this situation is not that difficult to choose
[4443.30 → 4445.48] but a camera I just don't care about
[4445.48 → 4445.94] right
[4445.94 → 4448.74] but oh think of all the cool slo-mo stuff
[4448.74 → 4449.34] don't
[4449.34 → 4449.98] don't care
[4449.98 → 4450.92] a thousand FPS
[4450.92 → 4451.92] meh
[4451.92 → 4452.60] oh
[4452.60 → 4454.38] I have no like
[4454.38 → 4455.32] okay that's cool
[4455.32 → 4458.40] I can film like my dog jumping for a ball
[4458.40 → 4460.34] no, no no, no
[4460.34 → 4461.46] at a thousand FPS
[4461.46 → 4462.50] you can
[4462.50 → 4464.28] you can film like a sneeze
[4464.28 → 4464.92] you can do a lot of stuff
[4464.92 → 4465.30] yeah
[4465.30 → 4466.08] and like
[4466.08 → 4467.18] and that's pretty cool
[4467.18 → 4468.32] and I'll watch that on YouTube
[4468.32 → 4469.92] from the slo-mo guys
[4469.92 → 4470.72] or whoever it is
[4470.72 → 4472.12] and I'll watch a few videos
[4472.12 → 4472.86] and then get bored
[4472.86 → 4474.04] because they're all the same
[4474.04 → 4475.04] and then not care
[4475.04 → 4476.34] which is exactly what would happen
[4476.34 → 4477.04] if I owned the camera
[4477.04 → 4478.40] the punch in the stomach is pretty good
[4478.40 → 4479.70] the punch in the stomach
[4479.70 → 4481.46] have you seen the slo-mo guy's stomach punch?
[4481.46 → 4482.80] I don't think so
[4482.80 → 4483.54] it's kind of amazing
[4483.54 → 4484.38] yeah
[4484.38 → 4485.08] of course
[4485.08 → 4485.38] yeah
[4485.38 → 4485.68] yeah
[4485.68 → 4487.62] it's like actually kind of awesome
[4487.62 → 4488.36] that's pretty cool
[4488.36 → 4489.92] okay
[4489.92 → 4492.48] so what other discussion topics do we have here
[4492.48 → 4493.62] because honestly the Twitter
[4493.62 → 4495.48] the Twitter questions are pretty weak tonight
[4495.48 → 4496.96] no offence guys
[4496.96 → 4497.68] okay
[4497.68 → 4497.96] so
[4497.96 → 4499.88] I'm just going to jump into
[4499.88 → 4500.26] sure
[4500.26 → 4502.42] the Bethesda announcement
[4502.42 → 4503.50] so Bethesda announced
[4503.50 → 4504.74] that they were going to announce
[4504.74 → 4506.00] an announcement
[4506.00 → 4508.78] I think we went one too far
[4508.78 → 4509.68] but that's
[4509.68 → 4509.96] no, no
[4509.96 → 4510.74] they announced
[4510.74 → 4511.54] that they were gonna
[4511.54 → 4512.40] oh no yeah you're right
[4512.40 → 4512.72] they announced
[4512.72 → 4514.12] that they were going to announce something
[4514.12 → 4516.60] it's not anything to do
[4516.60 → 4517.28] with Elder Scrolls Online
[4517.28 → 4518.90] it's not anything to do
[4518.90 → 4519.46] with Dishonoured
[4519.46 → 4521.14] if you look at their other IPs
[4521.14 → 4522.34] they're not going to be doing anything
[4522.34 → 4523.80] with the Elder Scrolls
[4523.80 → 4524.92] other than the Elder Scrolls Online
[4524.92 → 4526.18] for a while
[4526.18 → 4527.60] so that's pretty much off the table
[4527.60 → 4528.34] hold on
[4528.34 → 4530.98] do you think it has something to do
[4530.98 → 4532.42] with some LucasArts thing
[4532.42 → 4533.02] that they've acquired
[4533.02 → 4536.04] I wonder
[4536.04 → 4537.56] that's interesting
[4537.56 → 4539.72] that's quite different
[4539.72 → 4541.34] from what they do
[4541.34 → 4542.72] so
[4542.72 → 4544.86] but that doesn't matter
[4544.86 → 4546.36] it could mean that they do it
[4546.36 → 4547.66] that's actually fascinating
[4547.66 → 4549.32] what a lot of people are speculating
[4549.32 → 4549.94] and I would agree
[4549.94 → 4551.20] is that it might be
[4551.20 → 4553.62] another thing in the Fallout series
[4553.62 → 4555.84] because it's about the right amount of time
[4555.84 → 4556.82] not that long ago
[4556.82 → 4557.82] they're hiring developers
[4557.82 → 4558.60] for a new game
[4558.60 → 4560.86] it just kind of makes sense
[4560.86 → 4561.76] it slots properly
[4561.76 → 4562.88] so it kind of makes sense
[4562.88 → 4563.86] so it's very possibly Fallout
[4563.86 → 4565.26] but with everything
[4565.26 → 4566.54] that just happened with Star Wars
[4566.54 → 4568.50] that's fascinating
[4568.50 → 4570.46] and Disney does like
[4570.46 → 4572.04] they just said
[4572.04 → 4573.34] we're going to outsource crap
[4573.34 → 4574.12] we're going to outsource crap
[4574.12 → 4575.74] and when Disney does that
[4575.74 → 4576.60] they outsource everything
[4576.60 → 4577.30] and they get it done
[4577.30 → 4578.72] it's not like a lot of IPs
[4578.72 → 4579.16] where they're like
[4579.16 → 4580.66] oh yeah we're not going to develop this
[4580.66 → 4581.92] but someone can pick it up
[4581.92 → 4582.56] and it dies
[4582.56 → 4584.80] Disney actually tries to outsource things
[4584.80 → 4586.08] so this actually might happen
[4586.08 → 4587.98] and that would be really interesting
[4587.98 → 4590.22] a Bethesda Star Wars thing
[4590.22 → 4591.52] I still think
[4591.52 → 4592.32] that would be
[4592.32 → 4593.24] actually
[4593.24 → 4594.06] potentially
[4594.06 → 4595.18] really cool
[4595.18 → 4596.24] because I kind of maintain
[4596.24 → 4596.92] that Fallout
[4596.92 → 4598.24] and Elder Scrolls
[4598.24 → 4599.26] are kind of the same thing
[4599.26 → 4600.02] in a different setting
[4600.02 → 4600.80] oh yeah
[4600.80 → 4603.54] what if it was in a Star Wars setting
[4603.54 → 4604.60] Fallout 3
[4604.60 → 4605.12] and Elder Scrolls
[4605.12 → 4605.48] are very similar
[4605.48 → 4605.96] yeah
[4605.96 → 4607.38] that would be pretty cool
[4607.38 → 4608.14] and like
[4608.14 → 4609.08] they could change it up
[4609.08 → 4609.66] they've changed it up
[4609.66 → 4611.24] Dishonoured's very different
[4611.24 → 4612.64] compared to
[4612.64 → 4614.14] that would actually be like
[4614.14 → 4615.08] the coolest thing ever
[4615.08 → 4618.30] I still think it's
[4618.30 → 4619.06] probably not
[4619.06 → 4620.34] Habit Jedi
[4620.34 → 4623.20] what?
[4623.70 → 4625.00] it's like they already have
[4625.00 → 4626.22] cat-like reflexes
[4626.22 → 4627.28] so they'd be like
[4627.28 → 4627.94] that much better
[4627.94 → 4629.62] you just love Habit
[4629.62 → 4630.76] predictively cat-like
[4630.76 → 4631.72] I just like cats
[4631.72 → 4632.58] Habit
[4632.58 → 4633.28] whatever man
[4633.28 → 4634.18] which they came up with
[4634.18 → 4634.72] servals
[4634.72 → 4635.76] serval Jedi's
[4635.76 → 4636.54] serval Jedi's
[4636.54 → 4637.04] yeah
[4637.04 → 4637.90] for those of you
[4637.90 → 4638.50] who don't know
[4638.50 → 4640.20] my goal in life
[4640.20 → 4641.86] provided my wife
[4641.86 → 4642.80] doesn't figure out
[4642.80 → 4643.50] how to shut it down
[4643.50 → 4645.14] is to get a serval
[4645.14 → 4646.88] which is an African wildcat
[4646.88 → 4648.82] that gives anywhere
[4648.82 → 4651.98] from 25 to about 40 pounds
[4651.98 → 4653.30] depending on the
[4653.30 → 4655.68] depending on the serval itself
[4655.68 → 4657.94] so if you haven't seen one before
[4657.94 → 4660.86] they look a little something like
[4660.86 → 4662.38] I hope I'm switching
[4662.38 → 4663.52] to the right view here
[4663.52 → 4664.48] so they look a little
[4664.48 → 4665.68] something like this
[4665.68 → 4667.62] so they are
[4667.62 → 4669.24] they are like a serious business
[4669.24 → 4670.60] wildcat
[4670.60 → 4671.26] like not
[4671.26 → 4672.10] not a house cat
[4672.10 → 4672.96] I almost just said
[4672.96 → 4674.20] they have a weird form factor
[4674.20 → 4675.52] their body looks
[4675.52 → 4676.24] kind of
[4676.24 → 4677.32] chunky
[4677.32 → 4678.94] there's another one
[4678.94 → 4680.46] yeah
[4680.46 → 4681.20] they have kind of
[4681.20 → 4681.96] a strange build
[4681.96 → 4682.50] they have
[4682.50 → 4683.16] they have long legs
[4683.16 → 4683.60] so they
[4683.60 → 4685.16] they hunt small animals
[4685.16 → 4685.98] in tall grass
[4685.98 → 4686.92] so that's
[4686.92 → 4687.28] see here
[4687.28 → 4688.54] that's probably a serval
[4688.54 → 4689.92] in kind of its natural habitat
[4689.92 → 4690.46] that makes sense
[4690.46 → 4692.02] so their ears are big like this
[4692.02 → 4693.10] so that they can hear
[4693.10 → 4694.94] so they actually hear their prey
[4694.94 → 4696.34] they don't really rely on seeing it
[4696.34 → 4697.90] and then they
[4697.90 → 4700.78] that also helps with heat dissipation
[4700.78 → 4703.10] form factors and heat dissipation
[4703.10 → 4704.82] see we can't get away from PC talk
[4704.82 → 4705.82] no matter how hard we try
[4705.82 → 4707.52] and then they have kind of a short tail
[4707.52 → 4708.72] they're not climbers
[4708.72 → 4710.58] so they don't use their tail for balance
[4710.58 → 4711.90] the way that a lot of cats do
[4711.90 → 4714.86] and then they have long legs for jumping
[4714.86 → 4715.82] so here
[4715.82 → 4716.28] oh yeah
[4716.28 → 4717.56] this is a good one to give you an idea
[4717.56 → 4718.58] of how big a serval is
[4718.58 → 4720.00] so that's a grown human being
[4720.00 → 4721.58] and that's a serval next to
[4721.58 → 4722.98] next to them
[4722.98 → 4725.22] here's someone cuddling their serval
[4725.22 → 4726.82] so yeah
[4726.82 → 4728.44] I would really like to have one of these
[4728.44 → 4730.62] they are not a domesticated cat
[4730.62 → 4732.08] by any stretch of the imagination
[4732.08 → 4732.86] but
[4732.86 → 4734.56] if you adopt them very young
[4734.56 → 4736.80] and there are breeders here in Canada
[4736.80 → 4738.48] that are actually not that far away
[4738.48 → 4740.70] you can tame them
[4740.70 → 4742.50] which is different from domestication
[4742.50 → 4743.80] I guess no one knows
[4743.80 → 4744.82] what I was just laughing at
[4744.82 → 4746.06] what were you laughing at?
[4746.28 → 4747.90] you struggling so hard
[4747.90 → 4749.16] to close that window
[4749.16 → 4750.18] and then move it over to Twitter
[4750.18 → 4750.72] oh I know
[4750.72 → 4752.70] it's like the stupid ball thing
[4752.70 → 4754.46] it's not actually that easy to use
[4754.46 → 4755.46] you can't use it at all
[4755.46 → 4756.14] not at all
[4756.14 → 4757.08] you shouldn't be laughing
[4757.08 → 4757.84] I was just laughing
[4757.84 → 4758.52] because it was funny
[4758.52 → 4759.62] I knew how difficult it was
[4759.62 → 4760.94] we should do
[4760.94 → 4762.64] we should do the last news item
[4762.64 → 4763.36] of the week
[4763.36 → 4764.56] we've done all of them
[4764.56 → 4764.90] nope
[4764.90 → 4766.20] EA worst company of the year
[4766.20 → 4766.84] we should do that
[4766.84 → 4767.86] so we can finish up
[4767.86 → 4768.66] news items of the week
[4768.66 → 4771.06] yeah, so EA is the worst company of the year
[4771.06 → 4772.48] for the second time running
[4772.48 → 4774.18] I don't buy it
[4774.18 → 4775.86] neither of us do
[4775.86 → 4777.56] like yeah
[4777.56 → 4779.00] EA kind of screws around a lot
[4779.00 → 4780.24] we've ripped on them a lot
[4780.24 → 4780.68] on the street
[4780.68 → 4781.82] yeah we actually like
[4781.82 → 4782.56] I don't think
[4782.56 → 4784.44] probably more than anyone else
[4784.44 → 4785.26] we've ripped on EA
[4785.26 → 4786.68] probably because there's that little stint
[4786.68 → 4789.78] but they do not deserve that
[4789.78 → 4791.64] to be completely frank
[4791.64 → 4794.04] I mean what's the worst thing they can do
[4794.04 → 4797.04] they can have like inconsistent servers
[4797.04 → 4798.64] or like a bad patch
[4798.64 → 4799.50] bad patches
[4799.50 → 4799.96] and like
[4799.96 → 4800.36] or like
[4800.36 → 4801.52] release like
[4801.52 → 4801.88] oh
[4801.88 → 4803.94] release day DLC
[4803.94 → 4806.88] see like this is all horrible stuff
[4806.88 → 4808.30] first world problems
[4808.30 → 4809.92] but they're not BP oil
[4809.92 → 4810.84] yes
[4810.84 → 4811.40] they're not
[4811.40 → 4812.24] Bank of America
[4812.24 → 4814.16] they're not a private military company
[4814.16 → 4815.58] they're not insurance companies
[4815.58 → 4816.44] they're not oil companies
[4816.44 → 4817.64] they're not prostitution rings
[4817.64 → 4818.50] they're not like
[4818.50 → 4821.46] like actually bad things
[4821.46 → 4823.92] so like
[4823.92 → 4824.84] yeah guys
[4824.84 → 4825.72] they're not healthcare
[4825.72 → 4826.16] they're not
[4826.16 → 4826.92] okay I mean remember
[4826.92 → 4828.18] it's the worst American company
[4828.18 → 4829.30] they're not like
[4829.30 → 4830.56] healthcare insurers
[4830.56 → 4832.22] that just bone you
[4832.22 → 4832.98] like
[4832.98 → 4834.62] like there's actually
[4834.62 → 4836.64] worse companies
[4836.64 → 4838.76] but I think it's just a bunch of like
[4838.76 → 4839.44] sorry about that
[4839.44 → 4841.06] I think it's just like a bunch of
[4841.06 → 4842.90] sort of butt hurt internet people
[4842.90 → 4844.20] that vote on this
[4844.20 → 4845.12] it's a bunch of gamers
[4845.12 → 4846.26] like it makes sense
[4846.26 → 4848.32] and like I understand why you guys are voting for EA
[4848.32 → 4849.78] they've probably wronged you
[4849.78 → 4851.44] but come on
[4851.44 → 4853.88] Bank of America was on that list
[4853.88 → 4856.76] like there's some really brutal companies
[4856.76 → 4857.76] that were on that list
[4857.76 → 4860.96] and like companies that should have been on that list
[4860.96 → 4861.66] but weren't
[4861.66 → 4862.30] but weren't
[4862.30 → 4863.94] and like just
[4863.94 → 4867.20] in terms of the actual impact of what EA does
[4867.20 → 4871.30] if tomorrow EA did the worst thing they could possibly do
[4871.30 → 4872.64] to every single one of their customers
[4872.64 → 4875.28] it wouldn't be anywhere near the impact of one tanker spill
[4875.28 → 4879.00] that could have been prevented by some kind of negligence
[4879.00 → 4879.78] or whatever else
[4879.78 → 4881.34] and anything EA does
[4881.34 → 4882.64] I don't think any of its malicious
[4882.64 → 4885.04] I think it's misguided and negligent
[4885.04 → 4887.66] and they're doing things
[4887.66 → 4890.06] that they should probably read into their market more
[4890.06 → 4891.78] and figure out they shouldn't do
[4891.78 → 4892.70] negligence
[4892.70 → 4892.92] yeah
[4892.92 → 4894.12] again same thing
[4894.12 → 4895.10] they're trying to grab money
[4895.10 → 4896.62] everyone tries to grab money
[4896.62 → 4898.26] they're just doing it in very poor ways
[4898.26 → 4899.08] and they need to fix that
[4899.08 → 4899.86] but like it's not
[4899.86 → 4901.80] but at least the way that they grab money
[4901.80 → 4905.08] isn't you need gasoline to get to work
[4905.08 → 4905.74] therefore
[4905.74 → 4906.92] let's kill you
[4906.92 → 4907.56] gouge you
[4907.56 → 4907.94] double the price
[4907.94 → 4908.56] and then
[4908.56 → 4910.36] Scrooge out on our
[4910.36 → 4910.92] like
[4910.92 → 4912.44] big offshore
[4912.44 → 4914.42] like oil drilling facilities
[4914.42 → 4916.06] so that they spill oil all in the ocean
[4916.06 → 4916.32] like
[4916.32 → 4917.92] that's a lot worse
[4917.92 → 4919.54] like actually bad stuff
[4919.54 → 4920.56] for the world
[4920.56 → 4922.00] that's like bad
[4922.00 → 4923.36] so
[4923.36 → 4924.10] yeah
[4924.10 → 4925.46] yeah
[4925.46 → 4926.22] pretty brutal
[4926.22 → 4926.86] so guys
[4926.86 → 4928.12] big picture here
[4928.12 → 4930.02] EA's not that bad
[4930.02 → 4931.86] people are going to think that we're like
[4931.86 → 4933.40] EA sponsored at some point
[4933.40 → 4933.98] no
[4933.98 → 4935.62] I don't think either of us are really
[4935.62 → 4936.32] exactly
[4936.32 → 4938.18] fans at this point
[4938.18 → 4939.88] I was kind of excited for SimCity
[4939.88 → 4941.24] I played SimCity a lot when I was a kid
[4941.24 → 4941.60] and I think
[4941.60 → 4943.74] the most recent one was a massive letdown
[4943.74 → 4944.82] more in just their servers
[4944.82 → 4946.30] but in the gameplay elements
[4946.30 → 4947.22] as an entirety
[4947.22 → 4947.78] as a whole
[4947.78 → 4948.26] all together
[4948.26 → 4948.92] there you go
[4948.92 → 4949.80] we're not sponsored by EA
[4949.80 → 4951.18] I would love to be
[4951.18 → 4952.20] yeah
[4952.20 → 4953.90] if anyone from EA is watching
[4953.90 → 4956.74] battlefield 4
[4956.74 → 4957.48] let's get it done
[4957.48 → 4963.52] we haven't talked about CISA yet either
[4963.52 → 4964.56] right
[4964.56 → 4965.96] if you sponsor us EA
[4965.96 → 4968.44] we can help you fix these bad launches
[4968.44 → 4969.02] that we've got
[4969.02 → 4969.62] you could just
[4969.62 → 4971.74] we'll work as consultants for you
[4971.74 → 4972.22] 100%
[4972.22 → 4974.48] to tell you all the things you're doing wrong
[4974.48 → 4975.66] that are actually obvious
[4975.66 → 4976.92] this is a fixable
[4976.92 → 4981.18] it's a very fixable situation
[4981.18 → 4983.08] so CISA
[4983.08 → 4984.50] yay
[4984.50 → 4984.82] so
[4984.82 → 4986.24] SOPA's sort aback
[4986.24 → 4987.62] passed behind closed doors
[4987.62 → 4988.66] and actually like
[4988.66 → 4989.84] like actually back
[4989.84 → 4991.00] like done back
[4991.00 → 4994.24] passed behind closed doors
[4994.24 → 4995.50] Google is like
[4995.50 → 4997.04] fighting
[4997.04 → 4998.28] aggressively
[4998.28 → 4999.56] to stop it
[4999.56 → 5000.18] which is
[5000.18 → 5000.90] good
[5000.90 → 5001.86] because
[5001.86 → 5003.86] while Google is realistically
[5003.86 → 5004.20] doing it
[5004.20 → 5005.16] that's what they're basically doing
[5005.16 → 5005.96] but I'm not going to do that
[5005.96 → 5006.62] on our live stream
[5006.62 → 5008.72] because I'm much more polite than that
[5008.72 → 5008.82] did you actually
[5008.82 → 5009.10] no I
[5009.10 → 5009.62] I almost
[5009.62 → 5011.34] I almost lifted one finger
[5011.34 → 5012.78] it's the like slow
[5012.78 → 5013.56] but it was this one
[5013.56 → 5014.68] it will have happened
[5014.68 → 5014.88] yeah
[5014.88 → 5016.36] it might have happened
[5016.36 → 5016.88] um
[5016.88 → 5019.82] the the the the the
[5019.82 → 5021.08] what was the
[5021.08 → 5021.76] the trumpet one
[5021.76 → 5022.18] from
[5022.18 → 5023.08] uh
[5023.08 → 5024.16] Almighty something
[5024.16 → 5025.74] oh
[5025.74 → 5027.20] you're not talking about
[5027.20 → 5028.04] Bruce Almighty
[5028.04 → 5028.48] are you
[5028.48 → 5028.54] yeah
[5028.54 → 5029.52] I saw the preview
[5029.52 → 5031.18] I saw the preview
[5031.18 → 5031.88] for that movie
[5031.88 → 5033.14] and it was all I needed to know
[5033.14 → 5034.42] I did not see that movie
[5034.42 → 5035.20] it looked ridiculous
[5035.20 → 5036.68] but what's his name is God
[5036.68 → 5037.74] Jim Carrey
[5037.74 → 5038.32] no
[5038.32 → 5038.86] what
[5038.86 → 5039.16] who
[5039.16 → 5039.94] he's not God
[5039.94 → 5041.22] oh no he's Bruce
[5041.22 → 5041.96] it doesn't
[5041.96 → 5042.88] I think Bruce
[5042.88 → 5044.00] I think God gives him
[5044.00 → 5045.66] powers for like a few days
[5045.66 → 5045.86] or something
[5045.86 → 5046.78] it doesn't matter
[5046.78 → 5048.82] it looked so stupid
[5048.82 → 5050.24] the premise was stupid
[5050.24 → 5051.54] I don't even remember
[5051.54 → 5052.14] if I liked him
[5052.14 → 5052.56] and I even
[5052.56 → 5054.22] I even like Jim Carrey
[5054.22 → 5054.72] like
[5054.72 → 5055.36] he's awesome
[5055.36 → 5056.84] he's like one of my
[5056.84 → 5057.76] dirty little secrets
[5057.76 → 5058.24] you know
[5058.24 → 5059.52] like guilty pleasure
[5059.52 → 5060.98] I like Jim Carrey
[5060.98 → 5061.60] he's awesome
[5061.60 → 5062.94] that's a weird way to describe it
[5062.94 → 5063.92] but that movie
[5063.92 → 5065.88] was not going to be watchable for me
[5065.88 → 5066.74] I know this
[5066.74 → 5067.88] I was like
[5067.88 → 5069.74] yeah that's going to be a cable guy moment for me
[5069.74 → 5071.08] and I'm not going to be able to sit through it
[5071.08 → 5071.72] so
[5071.72 → 5072.06] no
[5072.06 → 5072.88] I couldn't do it
[5072.88 → 5074.06] wasn't there like a
[5074.06 → 5074.68] Morgan Freeman
[5074.68 → 5076.54] oh Morgan Freeman's amazing
[5076.54 → 5077.10] I love Morgan Freeman
[5077.10 → 5078.26] Morgan Freeman was God
[5078.26 → 5080.82] that's like enough of a reason to go watch it
[5080.82 → 5081.74] it doesn't matter
[5081.74 → 5083.52] Morgan Freeman is God
[5083.52 → 5085.10] you could cast like
[5085.10 → 5087.12] you could cast Tom Hanks as like
[5087.12 → 5087.64] you know
[5087.64 → 5088.26] um
[5088.26 → 5089.58] I don't know
[5089.58 → 5091.74] Hercules
[5091.74 → 5094.18] well actually you probably shouldn't
[5094.18 → 5095.34] but
[5095.34 → 5096.20] what?
[5096.54 → 5097.54] I still wouldn't see it
[5097.54 → 5098.56] even though I love Tom Hanks
[5098.56 → 5100.10] if Tom Hanks was cast as Hercules
[5100.10 → 5101.46] you would probably watch that
[5101.46 → 5102.50] I probably would
[5102.50 → 5104.88] just for the sheer spectacle of it
[5104.88 → 5105.54] because it's like wait
[5105.54 → 5108.30] why is Tom Hanks cast as Hercules?
[5108.74 → 5109.38] can you imagine
[5109.38 → 5110.76] what would Tom Hanks look like
[5110.76 → 5112.10] if he is like worked out hardcore?
[5112.88 → 5113.90] well that could be like
[5113.90 → 5114.80] old Hercules
[5114.80 → 5115.30] yeah
[5115.30 → 5116.20] old Hercules
[5116.20 → 5117.94] who's like all decrepit now
[5117.94 → 5119.18] and he's like funny
[5119.18 → 5120.10] and cheers people up
[5120.10 → 5120.74] you know
[5120.74 → 5121.60] for whatever reason
[5121.60 → 5122.66] it's kind of crazy
[5122.66 → 5124.08] like going back and watching
[5124.08 → 5125.26] movies that
[5125.26 → 5126.12] these actors made
[5126.12 → 5127.10] when they were super young
[5127.10 → 5128.32] like looking at someone like
[5128.32 → 5130.18] like watching old Bond movies
[5130.18 → 5131.18] with Sean Connery
[5131.18 → 5132.58] and then watching something like
[5132.58 → 5133.10] The Rock
[5133.10 → 5134.54] and you're just like
[5134.54 → 5136.06] wow
[5136.06 → 5138.38] like I've actually
[5138.38 → 5138.98] because
[5138.98 → 5140.04] because of movies
[5140.04 → 5140.86] and because you can
[5140.86 → 5142.44] you can capture someone's likeness
[5142.44 → 5143.16] so well
[5143.16 → 5144.30] sort of that
[5144.30 → 5145.38] that long ago
[5145.38 → 5145.70] and
[5145.70 → 5147.20] and it's been so long
[5147.20 → 5148.32] you can actually watch
[5148.32 → 5149.30] someone's entire
[5149.30 → 5150.54] kind of life
[5150.54 → 5151.70] and it's kind of bizarre
[5151.70 → 5152.18] like you see
[5152.18 → 5153.92] you see Tom Hanks in Big
[5153.92 → 5154.96] and then you see him today
[5154.96 → 5155.32] and you're like
[5155.32 → 5155.72] oh
[5155.72 → 5156.20] yeah
[5156.20 → 5156.80] yeah
[5156.80 → 5158.16] he was like a super young guy
[5158.16 → 5158.70] at one point
[5158.70 → 5159.40] holy crap
[5159.40 → 5161.06] it's just weird to realize
[5161.06 → 5161.70] that actually
[5161.70 → 5163.24] those people are actually people
[5163.24 → 5164.34] and like Matthew Broderick
[5164.34 → 5165.42] when he did that
[5165.42 → 5166.68] Ferris Bueller's Day Out
[5166.68 → 5168.04] commercial for the Super Bowl
[5168.04 → 5169.34] and I was just like
[5169.34 → 5170.96] now he's just kind of like
[5170.96 → 5171.78] a weird looking
[5171.78 → 5172.64] middle-aged dude
[5172.64 → 5173.72] it's like
[5173.72 → 5175.36] no wonder his acting career
[5175.36 → 5176.22] sort of disappeared
[5176.22 → 5177.28] the hype around that
[5177.28 → 5177.68] sorry Matthew
[5177.68 → 5178.32] if you're watching
[5178.32 → 5179.38] the hype around that
[5179.38 → 5180.04] coming back
[5180.04 → 5181.24] was insane
[5181.24 → 5183.10] everyone thought it was going to be
[5183.10 → 5184.26] I didn't enjoy the movie
[5184.26 → 5186.30] did not enjoy
[5186.30 → 5187.24] Ferris Bueller's Day Off
[5187.24 → 5187.74] I don't even know
[5187.74 → 5188.30] if I've seen it
[5188.30 → 5189.32] it's just stupid
[5189.32 → 5190.14] which is brutal
[5190.14 → 5191.12] I haven't seen a lot of movies
[5191.12 → 5191.50] but whatever
[5191.50 → 5192.26] but like the
[5192.26 → 5193.14] did you see the hype
[5193.14 → 5195.00] around Ferris Bueller's Days Off 2
[5195.00 → 5195.42] or whatever
[5195.42 → 5196.22] no
[5196.22 → 5196.80] that everyone thought
[5196.80 → 5197.34] was going to come
[5197.34 → 5198.10] after that commercial
[5198.10 → 5198.62] and stuff
[5198.62 → 5200.60] it was insane
[5200.60 → 5202.52] they should have just done it
[5202.52 → 5203.54] after they saw that hype
[5203.54 → 5204.28] they should have just been like
[5204.28 → 5204.66] okay
[5204.66 → 5206.28] we'll make tons of money
[5206.28 → 5207.42] on like
[5207.42 → 5208.52] the worst movie ever
[5208.52 → 5209.36] because a sequel
[5209.36 → 5210.46] about a movie
[5210.46 → 5211.58] where the entire premise
[5211.58 → 5212.64] is just like
[5212.64 → 5214.06] someone pretends to be sick
[5214.06 → 5214.66] and they're not
[5214.66 → 5215.86] well they would have just done
[5215.86 → 5216.76] he pretends to be sick
[5216.76 → 5217.50] at his job
[5217.50 → 5219.06] and it's the same thing
[5219.06 → 5220.04] like honestly
[5220.04 → 5221.28] they would have just done that
[5221.28 → 5222.24] and like you know what
[5222.24 → 5223.20] they could have made it
[5223.20 → 5224.20] funny enough
[5224.20 → 5225.26] that people didn't hate it
[5225.26 → 5226.26] and they could have made
[5226.26 → 5227.96] tons of money
[5227.96 → 5229.80] like they should have just done it
[5229.80 → 5232.32] yeah
[5232.32 → 5233.24] anyway
[5233.24 → 5233.76] it doesn't
[5233.76 → 5234.82] everyone's sequels
[5234.82 → 5236.06] we're supposed to be talking
[5236.06 → 5236.78] about CISA
[5236.78 → 5237.60] and we're talking about
[5237.60 → 5238.86] bad movies that we hated
[5238.86 → 5241.44] so pretty much
[5241.44 → 5242.42] what this will do
[5242.42 → 5243.34] is it will allow
[5243.34 → 5244.52] the US government
[5244.52 → 5245.20] to
[5245.20 → 5247.08] without your knowledge
[5247.08 → 5248.72] force your
[5248.72 → 5250.00] internet service provider
[5250.00 → 5250.60] or
[5250.60 → 5252.34] someone who's providing you
[5252.34 → 5253.12] any kind of service
[5253.12 → 5253.72] over the internet
[5253.72 → 5254.50] to provide your
[5254.50 → 5255.94] it's basically like a warrant
[5255.94 → 5257.26] for being able to see
[5257.26 → 5257.86] your information
[5257.86 → 5258.90] that you don't even get
[5258.90 → 5259.48] to know about
[5259.48 → 5260.36] and no one can do
[5260.36 → 5260.90] anything about
[5260.90 → 5262.24] yeah
[5262.24 → 5263.18] and it's passed
[5263.18 → 5265.10] it's like actually done
[5265.10 → 5268.02] so Google's giving
[5268.02 → 5268.84] the US government
[5268.84 → 5270.46] the old screw off
[5270.46 → 5272.04] and Microsoft's
[5272.04 → 5272.78] apparently going along
[5272.78 → 5273.14] with it
[5273.14 → 5275.68] which is
[5275.68 → 5276.76] but they did with Skype
[5276.76 → 5277.06] too
[5277.06 → 5279.00] they just kind of go
[5279.00 → 5279.68] okay
[5279.68 → 5281.26] okay
[5281.26 → 5282.62] they're just going along
[5282.62 → 5283.04] with the law
[5283.04 → 5283.64] Google's
[5283.64 → 5284.84] Microsoft doesn't really
[5284.84 → 5285.40] fight anyone
[5285.40 → 5287.82] if you look into it
[5287.82 → 5288.36] like they're just
[5288.36 → 5288.86] kind of like
[5288.86 → 5289.56] oh
[5289.56 → 5290.70] we'll just stay out of this
[5290.70 → 5291.76] pretty much every time
[5291.76 → 5292.50] you know it's funny
[5292.50 → 5293.42] because Microsoft
[5293.42 → 5294.54] I mean
[5294.54 → 5295.16] what
[5295.16 → 5297.04] what made Windows
[5297.04 → 5297.60] great
[5297.60 → 5298.98] was the flexibility
[5298.98 → 5300.82] and let's face it
[5300.82 → 5301.82] flexibility is just
[5301.82 → 5303.08] another word for piracy
[5303.08 → 5304.54] like
[5304.54 → 5306.22] Windows was
[5306.22 → 5307.30] the platform
[5307.30 → 5308.26] that just kind of
[5308.26 → 5309.54] supported every app
[5309.54 → 5310.50] for
[5310.50 → 5314.40] getting stuff
[5314.40 → 5316.12] doing things
[5316.12 → 5318.06] and gaming
[5318.06 → 5318.82] and
[5318.82 → 5320.16] and as soon as
[5320.16 → 5320.38] like
[5320.38 → 5321.78] there's no reason
[5321.78 → 5322.40] why Microsoft
[5322.40 → 5323.88] couldn't have just
[5323.88 → 5324.80] sort of
[5324.80 → 5327.10] gone along
[5327.10 → 5327.54] with
[5327.54 → 5328.48] continuing down
[5328.48 → 5329.14] that path
[5329.14 → 5329.82] and been
[5329.82 → 5330.72] because they had
[5330.72 → 5331.28] to get support
[5331.28 → 5331.78] because they were
[5331.78 → 5332.40] so dominant
[5332.40 → 5333.46] in terms of market share
[5333.46 → 5334.40] so no one could
[5334.40 → 5334.92] ignore them
[5334.92 → 5335.70] and then once
[5335.70 → 5336.40] they got that big
[5336.40 → 5336.92] all of a sudden
[5336.92 → 5337.52] they started playing
[5337.52 → 5338.08] by the rules
[5338.08 → 5339.40] and sort of
[5339.40 → 5340.62] cooperating with
[5340.62 → 5341.56] guys who want to
[5341.56 → 5342.04] protect the content
[5342.04 → 5342.62] and they got into
[5342.62 → 5343.46] the content distribution
[5343.46 → 5344.24] business themselves
[5344.24 → 5344.86] which is probably
[5344.86 → 5345.68] a big part of it
[5345.68 → 5346.84] but I have to wonder
[5346.84 → 5347.72] if they would be
[5347.72 → 5348.54] faltering the way
[5348.54 → 5349.36] that they are now
[5349.36 → 5350.80] if they were still
[5350.80 → 5352.10] supporting the same
[5352.10 → 5352.74] kind of
[5352.74 → 5354.04] free exchange of
[5354.04 → 5354.78] ideas
[5354.78 → 5356.20] that they used to
[5356.20 → 5357.66] and still allow
[5357.66 → 5358.36] I mean even things
[5358.36 → 5359.14] like things like
[5359.14 → 5360.86] the media centre PC
[5360.86 → 5363.28] would have taken off
[5363.28 → 5363.86] if
[5363.86 → 5365.48] if it was piracy
[5365.48 → 5366.04] easy
[5366.04 → 5367.80] absolutely
[5367.80 → 5368.84] I mean so many
[5368.84 → 5369.88] huge things
[5369.88 → 5370.76] have only really
[5370.76 → 5371.44] become mainstream
[5371.44 → 5371.76] because
[5371.76 → 5373.38] why did people
[5373.38 → 5374.64] like Android phones
[5374.64 → 5375.62] early ones
[5375.62 → 5376.52] weren't good
[5376.52 → 5378.94] but they liked
[5378.94 → 5379.76] that they could
[5379.76 → 5380.30] do whatever
[5380.30 → 5380.92] they wanted
[5380.92 → 5381.46] with the hardware
[5381.46 → 5382.58] which lets face it
[5382.58 → 5384.38] the thing people
[5384.38 → 5384.94] want to do
[5384.94 → 5385.66] with the hardware
[5385.66 → 5386.58] is
[5386.58 → 5389.10] yes and no
[5389.10 → 5390.00] customizability
[5390.00 → 5390.62] does not
[5390.62 → 5391.62] actually mean piracy
[5391.62 → 5391.88] no
[5391.88 → 5393.18] but a lot of the time
[5393.18 → 5394.04] for people
[5394.04 → 5394.56] it can
[5394.56 → 5395.84] someone who's not
[5395.84 → 5397.12] like a developer
[5397.12 → 5398.18] who's actually able
[5398.18 → 5398.62] to code things on their phone
[5398.62 → 5399.24] but a lot of these
[5399.24 → 5400.20] developers are alive
[5400.20 → 5401.42] because X amount of people
[5401.42 → 5402.62] are buying it
[5402.62 → 5403.24] that's true
[5403.24 → 5404.82] like people still
[5404.82 → 5405.70] are going to buy it
[5405.70 → 5405.96] it's not
[5405.96 → 5407.20] like every single person
[5407.20 → 5407.96] you pass on the street
[5407.96 → 5408.42] is just like
[5408.42 → 5409.12] zero morals
[5409.12 → 5410.42] about actually owning licenses
[5410.42 → 5410.82] like
[5410.82 → 5412.02] a lot of piracy
[5412.02 → 5412.86] just does happen
[5412.86 → 5413.26] but like
[5413.26 → 5414.08] on Android
[5414.08 → 5415.26] people develop those apps
[5415.26 → 5415.66] because
[5415.66 → 5417.14] they were going to make money
[5417.14 → 5418.70] there was going to be
[5418.70 → 5419.64] tons of piracy
[5419.64 → 5420.72] but there was enough there
[5420.72 → 5421.86] that they were going to make money
[5421.86 → 5423.74] like it happens
[5423.74 → 5424.06] and
[5424.06 → 5425.44] to avoid piracy
[5425.44 → 5425.76] and stuff
[5425.76 → 5426.82] just put ads in it
[5426.82 → 5427.92] that happened a lot too
[5427.92 → 5428.64] sure
[5428.64 → 5429.40] you know what
[5429.40 → 5430.34] we won't charge you
[5430.34 → 5430.74] for the game
[5430.74 → 5431.64] you're going to pirate it anyway
[5431.64 → 5432.34] just take it
[5432.34 → 5433.48] there's going to be an ad there
[5433.48 → 5434.12] like
[5434.12 → 5435.36] I don't know
[5435.36 → 5436.00] that kind of bones
[5436.00 → 5437.18] you're paying customers though
[5437.18 → 5438.70] or you mean like
[5438.70 → 5440.18] like cell phone games
[5440.18 → 5440.70] oh okay
[5440.70 → 5441.42] I thought you meant
[5441.42 → 5442.30] like product placements
[5442.30 → 5443.08] in AAA titles
[5443.08 → 5443.34] oh no
[5443.34 → 5444.58] I don't actually really
[5444.58 → 5445.56] this is a completely
[5445.56 → 5446.02] different topic
[5446.02 → 5447.00] but maybe I should
[5447.00 → 5447.60] just save it for later
[5447.60 → 5447.86] nope
[5447.86 → 5448.76] we're sticking on CISA
[5448.76 → 5449.24] okay
[5449.24 → 5451.26] I guess that was pretty much
[5451.26 → 5451.78] my whole thing
[5451.78 → 5452.66] guys it's bad
[5452.66 → 5453.46] um
[5453.46 → 5454.16] yeah
[5454.16 → 5455.70] I mean it's one of those things
[5455.70 → 5456.20] it's like
[5456.20 → 5457.16] the way that
[5457.16 → 5458.98] the US is moving backwards
[5458.98 → 5460.52] in terms of legislation
[5460.52 → 5461.78] is sort of alarming
[5461.78 → 5462.86] like things like
[5462.86 → 5463.64] they're doing the same thing
[5463.64 → 5464.80] someone brought this up
[5464.80 → 5465.50] I read this somewhere
[5465.50 → 5466.54] they're doing the exact same
[5466.54 → 5467.96] they're going in the exact same
[5467.96 → 5469.00] footsteps Rome did
[5469.00 → 5469.92] right before they crashed
[5469.92 → 5471.38] that's interesting
[5471.38 → 5472.28] which is fascinating
[5472.28 → 5473.04] I mean
[5473.04 → 5473.82] things like
[5473.82 → 5474.96] cell phone unlocking
[5474.96 → 5475.74] being illegal
[5475.74 → 5476.40] like
[5476.40 → 5477.58] why did that even happen
[5477.58 → 5479.74] how is that even possible
[5479.74 → 5481.50] why does anyone even care
[5481.50 → 5483.42] I mean
[5483.42 → 5485.28] the crazy thing
[5485.28 → 5486.70] is the amount of money
[5486.70 → 5487.40] being spent
[5487.40 → 5488.64] on things that don't matter
[5488.64 → 5490.06] it's like
[5490.06 → 5491.14] the amount of money
[5491.14 → 5491.88] that got spent
[5491.88 → 5492.90] preventing people
[5492.90 → 5494.60] from using their phone
[5494.60 → 5495.52] on a different network
[5495.52 → 5496.24] like
[5496.24 → 5497.28] between lobbying
[5497.28 → 5498.08] and between
[5498.08 → 5499.04] people that
[5499.04 → 5500.22] the public is paying
[5500.22 → 5500.80] to sit around
[5500.80 → 5501.50] and debate it
[5501.50 → 5502.00] and lawyers
[5502.00 → 5502.78] who are consulting
[5502.78 → 5503.42] those people
[5503.42 → 5504.88] and all that stuff
[5504.88 → 5505.78] it goes all the way down
[5505.78 → 5506.46] it's just sort of baffling
[5506.46 → 5507.32] did you hear about
[5507.32 → 5509.58] oh crap
[5509.58 → 5510.04] what's her name
[5510.04 → 5510.92] I can't remember
[5510.92 → 5511.76] all famous singers
[5511.76 → 5512.78] are sort of the same to me
[5512.78 → 5513.06] but
[5513.06 → 5515.34] someone refused
[5515.34 → 5516.42] a million dollars
[5516.42 → 5517.14] to sing
[5517.14 → 5518.14] at one of the
[5518.14 → 5519.30] republican conventions
[5519.30 → 5520.56] during the last election
[5520.56 → 5521.70] and I'm just like
[5521.70 → 5523.76] if you have a million dollars
[5523.76 → 5524.38] to spend
[5524.38 → 5525.48] on having a singer
[5525.48 → 5526.74] perform at your rally
[5526.74 → 5528.32] maybe you should worry
[5528.32 → 5529.02] about the debt
[5529.02 → 5529.88] your country's in
[5529.88 → 5531.08] which is kind of insane
[5531.08 → 5531.44] maybe
[5531.44 → 5531.86] yeah
[5531.86 → 5532.48] you know what
[5532.48 → 5534.32] the US needs
[5534.32 → 5535.16] a third party
[5535.16 → 5536.18] that goes
[5536.18 → 5537.72] we want the exact
[5537.72 → 5538.78] same campaign budget
[5538.78 → 5539.74] as the other two
[5539.74 → 5540.42] and we're going to
[5540.42 → 5541.40] dump the entire thing
[5541.40 → 5542.82] into actually something useful
[5542.82 → 5544.16] so elect us
[5544.16 → 5544.78] because of that
[5544.78 → 5545.56] and other than that
[5545.56 → 5546.30] we're just going to shut up
[5546.30 → 5547.02] and not say anything
[5547.02 → 5548.12] because we can't afford it
[5548.12 → 5548.84] people bring this up
[5548.84 → 5549.32] all the time
[5549.32 → 5549.92] they should have
[5549.92 → 5551.42] the candidates
[5551.42 → 5553.16] just like NASCAR drivers
[5553.16 → 5554.54] wear all the logos
[5554.54 → 5555.16] for all the companies
[5555.16 → 5555.76] that sponsor them
[5555.76 → 5556.58] that would be great
[5556.58 → 5557.70] it's actually really smart
[5557.70 → 5558.66] and that isn't like a
[5558.66 → 5560.14] like a liberal democratic
[5560.14 → 5561.38] like that's just
[5561.38 → 5562.70] no that's interesting
[5562.70 → 5563.70] I actually just
[5563.70 → 5564.68] am interested
[5564.68 → 5565.68] because I'm not going to say
[5565.68 → 5567.68] oh no you can't sponsor them
[5567.68 → 5568.72] because that's just
[5568.72 → 5569.22] kind of weird
[5569.22 → 5570.00] and under the table
[5570.00 → 5571.20] stuff will happen anyway
[5571.20 → 5571.90] you're not actually
[5571.90 → 5572.66] stopping anything
[5572.66 → 5573.80] but I'm just interested
[5573.80 → 5574.54] into what
[5574.54 → 5576.48] like who is sponsoring
[5576.48 → 5576.94] this guy
[5576.94 → 5577.66] is it NASCAR
[5577.66 → 5578.46] that would be cool
[5578.46 → 5579.74] like I don't know
[5579.74 → 5580.42] it's just interesting
[5580.42 → 5581.16] if anyone's wondering
[5581.16 → 5582.22] who our sponsors are
[5582.22 → 5582.88] it's Intel
[5582.88 → 5583.38] AMD
[5583.38 → 5583.88] Nvidia
[5583.88 → 5584.82] Steel Series
[5584.82 → 5585.62] Cooler Master
[5585.62 → 5587.46] crap I'm sure
[5587.46 → 5588.38] I'm forgetting someone
[5588.38 → 5590.44] we already said
[5590.44 → 5591.68] I'm trying to think
[5591.68 → 5592.56] of all the pre-rolls
[5592.56 → 5593.42] that I've put on things
[5593.42 → 5594.90] uh fractal design
[5594.90 → 5595.26] Corsair
[5595.26 → 5596.06] Corsair
[5596.06 → 5597.66] there you go
[5597.66 → 5598.62] there's probably
[5598.62 → 5599.84] I'm sure I'm missing someone
[5599.84 → 5601.24] we're sorry
[5601.24 → 5601.98] we're sorry
[5601.98 → 5602.98] you're probably not
[5602.98 → 5603.62] watching anyway
[5603.62 → 5605.22] but Matthew Broderick
[5605.22 → 5605.84] probably is
[5605.84 → 5607.24] Matthew Broderick
[5607.24 → 5607.90] sponsors us
[5607.90 → 5609.16] yeah Matthew Broderick
[5609.16 → 5610.70] with all of his money
[5610.70 → 5611.48] all of his money
[5611.48 → 5611.98] yeah
[5611.98 → 5613.56] which explains why
[5613.56 → 5614.00] we're streaming
[5614.00 → 5614.92] out of our garage
[5614.92 → 5616.84] wow
[5616.84 → 5620.26] oh yeah
[5620.26 → 5621.08] the topic that I
[5621.08 → 5621.86] almost went on
[5621.86 → 5623.44] um I don't even mind
[5623.44 → 5624.44] product placement
[5624.44 → 5624.90] of things
[5624.90 → 5626.28] as long as it's
[5626.28 → 5626.94] at least
[5626.94 → 5629.02] moderately enough
[5629.02 → 5629.42] subtle
[5629.42 → 5631.24] like unless it's like
[5631.24 → 5632.76] Pepsi
[5632.76 → 5633.98] okay
[5633.98 → 5635.06] it's not really a big deal
[5635.06 → 5635.52] someone says
[5635.52 → 5636.40] not trying to defend
[5636.40 → 5636.96] BP oil
[5636.96 → 5637.56] but technically
[5637.56 → 5638.50] they're not an American company
[5638.50 → 5639.18] of course they're not
[5639.18 → 5639.82] sorry British
[5639.82 → 5640.68] uh
[5640.68 → 5641.44] and the vote was
[5641.44 → 5642.36] for the past year
[5642.36 → 5642.90] and the oil spill
[5642.90 → 5643.62] happened in 2010
[5643.62 → 5645.96] it doesn't make
[5645.96 → 5646.54] companies
[5646.54 → 5647.14] sort of like
[5647.14 → 5647.92] less horrible
[5647.92 → 5649.08] in general
[5649.08 → 5649.56] but okay
[5649.56 → 5649.94] yes
[5649.94 → 5650.44] you're right
[5650.44 → 5650.80] BP
[5650.80 → 5652.10] but any oil company
[5652.10 → 5653.08] the general point
[5653.08 → 5653.52] fine
[5653.52 → 5654.20] let's talk
[5654.20 → 5655.04] ExxonMobil
[5655.04 → 5655.42] then
[5655.42 → 5656.56] it doesn't matter
[5656.56 → 5657.30] pick anyone
[5657.30 → 5658.12] or someone
[5658.12 → 5658.82] and they're
[5658.82 → 5659.58] they're all
[5659.58 → 5660.84] much more destructive
[5660.84 → 5661.64] than EA
[5661.64 → 5662.34] could ever be
[5662.34 → 5663.00] and they all
[5663.00 → 5664.20] do the same practices
[5664.20 → 5665.06] that BP did
[5665.06 → 5665.62] and just because
[5665.62 → 5666.54] it happened to BP
[5666.54 → 5667.26] doesn't mean that
[5667.26 → 5667.72] it's not going to
[5667.72 → 5668.58] happen to someone else
[5668.58 → 5669.46] BP was just
[5669.46 → 5670.30] the unlucky group
[5670.30 → 5671.02] when they all
[5671.02 → 5671.58] cheap out
[5671.58 → 5672.50] on the exact same
[5672.50 → 5673.38] way as BP does
[5673.38 → 5674.86] yeah
[5674.86 → 5678.74] Caleb says
[5678.74 → 5679.14] I don't know
[5679.14 → 5679.88] if this is correct
[5679.88 → 5680.62] in fact I suspect
[5680.62 → 5681.10] it's not
[5681.10 → 5682.04] but 50% of
[5682.04 → 5683.02] American tax dollars
[5683.02 → 5683.74] go to collection
[5683.74 → 5684.62] of the next year's
[5684.62 → 5685.06] taxes
[5685.06 → 5686.00] it's like
[5686.00 → 5688.98] it is like
[5688.98 → 5690.48] 57% goes to military
[5690.48 → 5690.76] or something
[5690.76 → 5691.78] I do believe
[5691.78 → 5692.62] that a significant
[5692.62 → 5693.36] amount of it
[5693.36 → 5694.24] probably does get
[5694.24 → 5694.94] blown on that
[5694.94 → 5696.02] but there you go
[5696.02 → 5696.56] on collecting more
[5696.56 → 5696.86] tax dollars
[5696.86 → 5697.26] we should do
[5697.26 → 5698.22] build guides
[5698.22 → 5698.50] yeah
[5698.50 → 5699.66] builds of the week
[5699.66 → 5700.84] so here
[5700.84 → 5701.82] I think I have
[5701.82 → 5703.22] oh here it is
[5703.22 → 5704.54] continuing with the theme
[5704.54 → 5705.82] we have two build guides
[5705.82 → 5706.24] this week
[5706.24 → 5707.08] we went with
[5707.08 → 5707.90] build logs
[5707.90 → 5708.66] build logs
[5708.66 → 5709.00] sorry
[5709.00 → 5710.02] build logs of the week
[5710.02 → 5710.88] so from the Linus
[5710.88 → 5711.38] you should probably
[5711.38 → 5712.18] explain what we're doing
[5712.18 → 5713.14] from the Linus
[5713.14 → 5713.98] tech tips' forum
[5713.98 → 5714.82] we feature
[5714.82 → 5716.50] two builds every week
[5716.50 → 5717.66] and
[5717.66 → 5718.62] that's exactly
[5718.62 → 5719.36] what I was doing
[5719.36 → 5720.00] okay fine
[5720.00 → 5720.40] you do it
[5720.40 → 5721.16] because I have to log in
[5721.16 → 5722.06] we feature two
[5722.06 → 5723.26] build logs of the week
[5723.26 → 5723.94] we do one
[5723.94 → 5724.68] that is
[5724.68 → 5725.36] like
[5725.36 → 5727.00] awesome
[5727.00 → 5727.64] but at least
[5727.64 → 5728.30] in range
[5728.30 → 5729.16] of the average person
[5729.16 → 5730.20] and then we do one
[5730.20 → 5730.84] that's
[5730.84 → 5731.66] like
[5731.66 → 5733.62] you kind of have to be nuts
[5733.62 → 5735.28] to be able to
[5735.28 → 5736.08] go there
[5736.08 → 5736.64] to be
[5736.64 → 5739.68] he's
[5739.68 → 5740.92] he's built his login name wrong
[5740.92 → 5741.54] sorry one second
[5741.54 → 5743.22] you have to be kind of nuts
[5743.22 → 5743.74] to be able to do it
[5743.74 → 5744.86] so we have one that's like
[5744.86 → 5746.34] really, really awesome
[5746.34 → 5746.92] and would take
[5746.92 → 5747.84] like time
[5747.84 → 5748.46] and planning
[5748.46 → 5749.38] and awesomeness
[5749.38 → 5750.48] and then we have one
[5750.48 → 5751.22] that's time
[5751.22 → 5751.70] and planning
[5751.70 → 5752.36] and awesomeness
[5752.36 → 5752.90] and money
[5752.90 → 5754.02] and insanity
[5754.02 → 5755.78] so yeah
[5755.78 → 5757.10] once Linus
[5757.10 → 5758.24] can log in
[5758.24 → 5759.32] which hopefully
[5759.32 → 5760.38] you don't get locked out here
[5760.38 → 5762.14] we will actually show you
[5762.14 → 5763.46] pictures of
[5763.46 → 5765.78] project snowflake
[5765.78 → 5767.68] there we go
[5767.68 → 5768.62] project snowflake
[5768.62 → 5769.68] hopefully the pictures load
[5769.68 → 5770.34] fast enough
[5770.34 → 5770.88] scroll down
[5770.88 → 5771.66] pictures are there
[5771.66 → 5775.70] oh they're big
[5775.70 → 5776.60] yeah
[5776.60 → 5777.44] they're all pretty big
[5777.44 → 5778.76] this is an important step
[5778.76 → 5779.96] of any water cooling build
[5779.96 → 5780.64] the reason he has
[5780.64 → 5781.38] paper towels
[5781.38 → 5782.18] he actually probably doesn't
[5782.18 → 5782.90] have enough in there
[5782.90 → 5784.86] paper towels are
[5784.86 → 5786.08] because you want to do
[5786.08 → 5787.20] a leak testing run
[5787.20 → 5788.64] in case there are any drips
[5788.64 → 5789.60] before you trust
[5789.60 → 5790.42] your water cooling
[5790.42 → 5791.12] it's a good idea
[5791.12 → 5792.64] nice white fittings
[5792.64 → 5794.26] oh just wait till you get
[5794.26 → 5794.90] a bigger shot
[5794.90 → 5795.80] it's amazing
[5795.80 → 5796.76] he's just doing some
[5796.76 → 5797.66] close-ups of some good
[5797.66 → 5798.28] looking stuff here
[5798.28 → 5799.30] he continues with the
[5799.30 → 5799.92] white and blue theme
[5799.92 → 5800.78] this is his tube
[5800.78 → 5801.58] running from
[5801.58 → 5802.66] yeah I don't know
[5802.66 → 5803.78] but like oh
[5803.78 → 5805.10] very nice
[5805.10 → 5806.34] just looks perfect
[5806.34 → 5807.54] very slick
[5807.54 → 5808.84] totally went for gold
[5808.84 → 5809.86] with the like
[5809.86 → 5810.74] not gold colour
[5810.74 → 5811.80] but he just went for
[5811.80 → 5812.58] awesomeness with his
[5812.58 → 5813.06] colour scheme
[5813.06 → 5813.94] stuck with it
[5813.94 → 5814.92] got really, really good
[5814.92 → 5815.84] parts that all worked
[5815.84 → 5816.26] together
[5816.26 → 5817.46] it just
[5817.46 → 5818.80] man it looks good
[5818.80 → 5819.30] yeah that looks
[5819.30 → 5819.88] outstanding
[5819.88 → 5822.06] very beautiful machine
[5822.06 → 5822.38] and like
[5822.38 → 5823.48] interesting pump choice
[5823.48 → 5824.20] yeah
[5824.20 → 5825.88] all the cable runs
[5825.88 → 5826.86] that you can see
[5826.86 → 5827.80] are nice and short
[5827.80 → 5828.52] right
[5828.52 → 5828.96] and then he's got
[5828.96 → 5829.48] the long one
[5829.48 → 5829.96] but it's kind of
[5829.96 → 5830.58] hidden in the top
[5830.58 → 5831.08] so you don't really
[5831.08 → 5831.48] see it
[5831.48 → 5832.24] you mean the tubing
[5832.24 → 5832.56] runs
[5832.56 → 5833.28] yeah
[5833.28 → 5833.94] what did I say
[5833.94 → 5834.60] cable runs
[5834.60 → 5834.98] ugh
[5834.98 → 5836.26] saying all the wrong
[5836.26 → 5836.74] stuff tonight
[5836.74 → 5837.52] I'm tired
[5837.52 → 5838.46] it's been a long week
[5838.46 → 5838.48] I'm tired too
[5838.48 → 5839.68] and dyslexia
[5839.68 → 5840.68] the entire house
[5840.68 → 5841.34] has been sick
[5841.34 → 5841.92] which has just
[5841.92 → 5842.66] kind of sucked
[5842.66 → 5843.22] for me
[5843.22 → 5844.86] and then Slick
[5844.86 → 5845.64] doesn't sleep
[5845.64 → 5846.92] because of
[5846.92 → 5848.28] working on
[5848.28 → 5849.14] migrating the
[5849.14 → 5849.90] Linus Tech Tips
[5849.90 → 5850.88] forum at some point
[5850.88 → 5851.24] so
[5851.24 → 5852.64] great build
[5852.64 → 5853.54] Project Snowflake
[5853.54 → 5854.32] so that one's just
[5854.32 → 5855.74] just kind of awesome
[5855.74 → 5856.46] and then this one
[5856.46 → 5857.24] is just absolutely
[5857.24 → 5857.76] ridiculous
[5858.52 → 5859.30] make you envy
[5859.30 → 5860.48] because it's a TJ07
[5860.48 → 5862.56] yeah my TJ07 build
[5862.56 → 5863.24] is still not done
[5863.24 → 5864.48] and it's not this good
[5864.48 → 5864.78] either
[5864.78 → 5865.90] Project Lazy
[5865.90 → 5866.66] I've been waiting
[5866.66 → 5867.94] for more complete
[5867.94 → 5868.56] he says he's still
[5868.56 → 5868.86] going to be doing
[5868.86 → 5869.40] stuff to it
[5869.40 → 5870.24] and I believe him
[5870.24 → 5870.96] because he's nuts
[5870.96 → 5872.66] but like
[5872.66 → 5874.08] this is amazing
[5874.08 → 5875.48] that's beautiful
[5875.48 → 5876.78] look at the
[5876.78 → 5877.24] look at the
[5877.24 → 5878.28] suspended fans up here
[5878.28 → 5878.94] that's like
[5878.94 → 5879.98] MK2
[5879.98 → 5881.88] murder box style
[5881.88 → 5882.38] yeah
[5882.38 → 5883.72] very, very nice
[5883.72 → 5884.18] so nice
[5884.18 → 5885.26] little custom panels
[5885.26 → 5886.48] like painted
[5886.48 → 5887.04] everything
[5887.04 → 5887.56] he's got
[5887.56 → 5888.42] wow
[5888.42 → 5889.30] yeah
[5889.30 → 5892.78] I love
[5892.78 → 5893.40] round locks
[5893.40 → 5894.58] they're so unnecessary
[5894.58 → 5895.82] but they look really nice
[5895.82 → 5896.24] I know
[5896.24 → 5897.56] but they're so unnecessary
[5897.56 → 5899.36] but I just love them
[5899.36 → 5900.52] you can't even like
[5900.52 → 5901.26] debate that
[5901.26 → 5902.68] those are gorgeous fittings
[5902.68 → 5903.14] yeah
[5903.14 → 5904.18] I don't think I've seen
[5904.18 → 5905.50] EK's compressions in person
[5905.50 → 5906.74] those are really nice
[5906.74 → 5907.48] they're not that common
[5907.48 → 5908.36] yeah
[5908.36 → 5909.44] those are nice
[5909.44 → 5911.72] there's a big
[5911.72 → 5912.78] more wide out shot
[5912.78 → 5913.20] somewhere
[5913.20 → 5915.16] I think we missed it
[5915.16 → 5915.78] there we go
[5915.78 → 5916.48] oh that's the one
[5916.48 → 5916.72] yeah
[5916.72 → 5917.32] so there you go
[5917.32 → 5919.76] sorry this mouse
[5919.76 → 5920.84] really is super hard
[5920.84 → 5921.18] to control
[5921.18 → 5921.42] yeah
[5921.42 → 5922.16] I don't blame him
[5922.16 → 5922.34] at all
[5922.34 → 5923.04] it's really difficult
[5923.04 → 5924.34] so there you go
[5924.34 → 5925.22] that's just kind of awesome
[5925.22 → 5926.36] that doesn't look lazy
[5926.36 → 5926.76] at all
[5926.76 → 5927.62] to be perfectly honest
[5927.62 → 5927.94] no
[5927.94 → 5929.10] I think he's calling it
[5929.10 → 5929.90] lazy because it's been
[5929.90 → 5930.74] taking him quite a while
[5930.74 → 5931.58] but I think
[5931.58 → 5932.84] from beginning to end
[5932.84 → 5933.70] it probably took about
[5933.70 → 5934.54] at least the quarter
[5934.54 → 5935.04] the amount of time
[5935.04 → 5935.62] it took for yours
[5935.62 → 5936.66] yeah
[5936.66 → 5937.64] I know
[5937.64 → 5939.18] come on
[5939.18 → 5940.78] my rig looks pretty nice too
[5940.78 → 5942.30] I'm just bugging you
[5942.30 → 5942.72] I know
[5942.72 → 5944.56] my rig looks pretty
[5944.56 → 5945.92] okay it's not as good as this
[5945.92 → 5947.62] but it's not bad
[5947.62 → 5948.48] it's kind of awesome
[5948.48 → 5949.96] my rig
[5949.96 → 5950.86] I know thank you
[5950.86 → 5951.98] I was talking about
[5951.98 → 5952.50] Project Lazy
[5952.50 → 5954.34] but your rig is awesome too
[5954.34 → 5954.86] that's okay
[5954.86 → 5955.40] thank you
[5955.40 → 5956.26] if you want to check out
[5956.26 → 5956.94] these guys' builds
[5956.94 → 5958.02] I will tweet them both out
[5958.02 → 5959.92] but they are both going to be
[5959.92 → 5962.10] in Win speed's sticky
[5962.10 → 5963.66] at the top of the build log section
[5963.66 → 5964.44] on the forum
[5964.44 → 5966.50] so you can check those out later
[5966.50 → 5967.56] or you can check them out now
[5967.56 → 5969.14] whatever you want to do
[5969.14 → 5970.60] those are our build logs of the week
[5970.60 → 5973.62] thank you for making those build logs
[5973.62 → 5977.14] do we have any other topics?
[5977.30 → 5978.06] I guess we're like
[5978.06 → 5979.12] after party mode now
[5979.12 → 5979.50] yeah
[5979.50 → 5981.92] I kind of have to pee
[5981.92 → 5984.62] so I'm going to do that
[5984.62 → 5985.20] alright
[5985.20 → 5986.26] are you coming back?
[5986.58 → 5986.76] yeah
[5986.76 → 5987.04] sure
[5987.04 → 5987.62] okay
[5987.62 → 5989.38] it'll take a while
[5989.38 → 5990.58] if I drop my phone in the toilet
[5990.58 → 5991.02] or something
[5991.02 → 5991.50] okay
[5991.50 → 5992.52] that would be really unfortunate
[5992.52 → 5993.28] you should probably not do that
[5993.28 → 5993.82] that's a one
[5993.82 → 5995.44] yeah why don't I leave my phone with you
[5995.44 → 5995.96] okay
[5995.96 → 5996.54] thanks
[5996.54 → 5997.16] okay cool
[5997.16 → 5997.80] thanks Rob
[5997.80 → 5999.46] that shouldn't actually be a thing
[5999.46 → 6000.16] that you're worried about
[6000.16 → 6001.42] you should talk about the NED tech one
[6001.42 → 6002.36] oh you didn't read it did you?
[6002.72 → 6003.30] not really
[6003.30 → 6003.70] no
[6003.70 → 6005.46] anyway
[6005.46 → 6007.50] so if I have anything to talk about
[6007.50 → 6009.18] that isn't anything to do with
[6009.18 → 6010.78] anything that we've talked about so far
[6011.00 → 6013.60] it's an awesome member of our forum
[6013.60 → 6015.28] watcher of the live stream
[6015.28 → 6016.98] follower of me on Twitter
[6016.98 → 6017.92] etc
[6017.92 → 6020.82] offered to send me a model M
[6020.82 → 6021.76] and did so
[6021.76 → 6024.26] and I'm ridiculously stoked for that to show up
[6024.26 → 6026.42] it was supposed to show up
[6026.42 → 6027.44] and then they held it
[6027.44 → 6030.54] and said that the address was wrong
[6030.54 → 6032.10] and then I called them
[6032.10 → 6032.64] and was like
[6032.64 → 6033.52] hey what's up
[6033.52 → 6035.10] the address is definitely right
[6035.10 → 6036.64] we get stuff shipped here all the time
[6036.64 → 6037.26] what's going on
[6037.26 → 6039.28] and they're like
[6039.28 → 6039.66] oh
[6039.66 → 6042.62] your name's Slick
[6042.62 → 6043.78] and I was like
[6043.78 → 6045.10] uh
[6045.10 → 6045.90] uh
[6045.90 → 6046.50] yeah
[6046.50 → 6048.60] like okay we don't have a phone number for you
[6048.60 → 6049.94] okay
[6049.94 → 6050.90] give them my phone number
[6050.90 → 6051.32] whatever
[6051.32 → 6053.60] that conversation's done
[6053.60 → 6054.34] hang up
[6054.34 → 6055.64] it's supposed to show up on Thursday
[6055.64 → 6056.50] doesn't show up
[6056.50 → 6057.08] okay
[6057.08 → 6057.70] that's random
[6057.70 → 6058.98] it's supposed to show up on Friday
[6058.98 → 6060.00] today
[6060.00 → 6061.28] doesn't show up
[6061.28 → 6062.48] what?
[6062.64 → 6063.36] I get a call
[6063.36 → 6064.18] check my voicemail
[6064.18 → 6065.78] because I was in the middle of a shot
[6065.78 → 6066.62] and
[6066.62 → 6067.48] they
[6067.48 → 6068.08] are
[6068.08 → 6068.96] holding it
[6068.96 → 6069.84] for a reason
[6069.84 → 6070.86] where the guy goes
[6070.86 → 6072.34] yeah we're holding it at customs
[6072.34 → 6072.72] because
[6072.72 → 6075.46] literally
[6075.46 → 6075.94] like
[6075.94 → 6076.82] growling
[6076.82 → 6078.28] no words were made out
[6078.28 → 6079.16] at all
[6079.16 → 6079.54] like
[6079.54 → 6081.24] fairly monotone growling
[6081.24 → 6083.06] and then right when he's done explaining it
[6083.06 → 6083.26] goes
[6083.26 → 6084.60] you can contact us at
[6084.60 → 6085.24] phone number
[6085.24 → 6085.88] like
[6085.88 → 6086.46] perfect
[6086.46 → 6087.22] perfectly
[6087.22 → 6088.94] done English
[6088.94 → 6089.84] before and after
[6089.84 → 6091.34] the description of what's wrong
[6091.34 → 6092.38] which is just growling
[6092.38 → 6093.52] so
[6093.52 → 6096.30] I have no idea what's going on
[6096.30 → 6097.46] but thanks UPS
[6097.46 → 6098.50] oh
[6098.50 → 6100.26] I'm so excited about this keyword
[6100.26 → 6100.98] like
[6100.98 → 6101.80] for instance
[6101.80 → 6103.84] I was sitting right here
[6103.84 → 6104.72] bench working
[6104.72 → 6107.12] I'm trying to do the updated H220 thing
[6107.12 → 6109.66] because we finally have everything figured out for that
[6109.66 → 6111.78] so that should be coming out early next week by the way
[6111.78 → 6112.86] um
[6112.86 → 6114.32] I'm trying to do that
[6114.32 → 6115.48] and I hear a doorbell
[6115.48 → 6117.80] and I jump up out of my seat and run
[6117.80 → 6118.80] uh
[6118.80 → 6120.18] Diesel comes in behind me
[6120.18 → 6122.54] B-roll and Linus come from other parts of the house
[6122.54 → 6124.04] and everyone funnels into the door
[6124.04 → 6125.72] because Linus is trying to beat me
[6125.72 → 6126.64] because he's trying to troll me
[6126.64 → 6127.64] and
[6127.64 → 6129.14] what is
[6129.14 → 6130.02] what is this
[6130.02 → 6132.04] you have something secret
[6132.04 → 6133.96] uh
[6133.96 → 6135.04] anyway
[6135.04 → 6136.74] so everyone's trying to beat me to the door
[6136.74 → 6137.82] and
[6137.82 → 6140.02] I have something behind my back
[6140.02 → 6141.24] but the only way you'll know what it is
[6141.24 → 6142.20] is to smell my finger
[6142.20 → 6142.66] what?
[6142.82 → 6143.14] no
[6143.14 → 6143.74] what?
[6144.02 → 6144.34] no
[6144.34 → 6147.60] that's disgusting
[6147.60 → 6149.92] that's actually disgusting
[6149.92 → 6152.54] you're not going to win this
[6152.54 → 6154.86] you know how to get out of these right?
[6154.86 → 6155.42] yeah
[6155.42 → 6155.96] okay
[6155.96 → 6156.46] that's just
[6156.46 → 6158.98] well I'm trying to hold something behind my back
[6158.98 → 6160.02] that has to stay level
[6160.02 → 6161.44] but you can just turn your wrist
[6161.44 → 6162.40] yeah you can turn your
[6162.40 → 6164.38] I need a little bit of
[6164.38 → 6165.16] no you go the other way
[6165.16 → 6165.42] other way
[6165.42 → 6166.66] and then go thin
[6166.66 → 6167.48] and then go through
[6167.48 → 6168.48] the problem is that
[6168.48 → 6169.44] you're strong enough
[6169.44 → 6171.00] that I would need some body momentum
[6171.00 → 6172.08] in order to make it happen
[6172.08 → 6173.32] and I'm trying to keep this level
[6173.32 → 6174.28] ah
[6174.28 → 6174.74] stop
[6174.74 → 6176.38] besides I can just trick you
[6176.38 → 6178.80] get here
[6178.80 → 6179.76] I love pickles
[6179.76 → 6180.20] oh pickles
[6180.20 → 6180.60] yeah
[6180.60 → 6182.46] hi what did you think it was?
[6182.46 → 6184.06] I don't know
[6184.06 → 6185.30] I don't want to smell your fingers
[6185.30 → 6187.08] so our 900D arrived today
[6187.08 → 6187.84] oh
[6187.84 → 6188.78] yeah that's nice
[6188.78 → 6189.58] one sec
[6189.58 → 6190.86] I just want to finish my story real quick
[6190.86 → 6192.06] so we all rushed to the door
[6192.06 → 6192.72] opened the door
[6192.72 → 6193.36] super excited
[6193.36 → 6194.14] and it's FedEx
[6194.14 → 6194.74] not UPS
[6194.74 → 6195.76] so we got a different shipment
[6195.76 → 6196.60] that was awesome
[6196.60 → 6198.44] I was pretty much the saddest person on the planet
[6198.44 → 6200.36] I was hoping it was UPS too
[6200.36 → 6201.60] so that I could take the keyboard
[6201.60 → 6202.28] and hide it somewhere
[6202.28 → 6203.54] and tell him it was someone else
[6203.54 → 6207.06] I would have actually paid the import duties
[6207.06 → 6209.84] just to see the look on his face
[6209.84 → 6211.64] or oh it would be greatest
[6211.64 → 6212.90] if I like rejected it or something
[6212.90 → 6213.88] oh my goodness
[6213.88 → 6214.82] oh my god
[6214.82 → 6216.32] I would have been so upset
[6216.32 → 6217.98] if I beat you to the door when they come
[6217.98 → 6218.94] and I reject it
[6218.94 → 6219.60] what would you do?
[6220.70 → 6221.30] probably just
[6221.30 → 6222.50] I don't even
[6222.50 → 6223.64] I would just explode
[6223.64 → 6224.18] because
[6224.18 → 6227.16] like I'm so excited about this keyboard
[6227.16 → 6229.58] I wanted a Model M for so long
[6229.58 → 6232.06] oh I'm so stoked for this keyboard
[6232.06 → 6234.84] man I ran quick
[6234.84 → 6236.34] you were a lot closer than I was
[6236.34 → 6237.04] and I beat you
[6237.04 → 6238.62] it only
[6238.62 → 6240.32] but it took me a while to think
[6240.32 → 6242.00] of trolling you
[6242.00 → 6244.18] so I didn't move for the door immediately
[6244.18 → 6245.78] it wasn't something I was planning to do
[6245.78 → 6246.30] okay
[6246.30 → 6248.50] oh man
[6248.50 → 6249.98] I was so upset
[6249.98 → 6252.68] anyway
[6252.68 → 6253.88] we have a 900D
[6253.88 → 6254.72] it just showed up
[6254.72 → 6255.92] I thought the box was
[6255.92 → 6257.94] like the actual box that 900D comes in
[6257.94 → 6260.18] I thought was the outside container
[6260.18 → 6261.64] because it's so beefy
[6261.64 → 6262.70] with the box inside
[6262.70 → 6263.06] yeah
[6263.06 → 6263.48] yeah
[6263.48 → 6264.62] it's so big
[6264.62 → 6265.78] and it's so beefy
[6265.78 → 6267.70] and it has like the support things on the corners
[6267.70 → 6269.20] which aren't actually part of the box
[6269.20 → 6271.54] those are extra I think
[6271.54 → 6272.24] but yeah
[6272.24 → 6272.84] I know
[6272.84 → 6274.26] but like it's still
[6274.26 → 6275.26] I don't know
[6275.26 → 6277.00] like it looked like an outer crate almost
[6277.00 → 6277.30] yeah
[6277.30 → 6278.44] like
[6278.44 → 6280.10] oops
[6280.10 → 6281.56] sorry about that
[6281.56 → 6282.66] so that's kind of ridiculous
[6282.66 → 6283.56] and
[6283.56 → 6284.32] yeah
[6284.32 → 6285.12] we haven't heard a D
[6285.12 → 6286.32] we can't do anything with it yet
[6286.32 → 6286.56] oh
[6286.56 → 6287.78] B-roll's here
[6287.78 → 6290.22] he has to pick up that hiking backpack
[6290.22 → 6291.68] that we used for the Patriot video
[6291.68 → 6292.24] oh
[6292.24 → 6293.96] oh yeah Patriot's another sponsor we have
[6293.96 → 6295.08] should I talk
[6295.08 → 6296.56] can I talk about the video
[6296.56 → 6296.88] sure
[6296.88 → 6297.80] okay
[6297.80 → 6298.42] so we're filming
[6298.42 → 6299.60] how in depth can I go
[6299.60 → 6302.90] uh well we're going to be releasing it soon
[6302.90 → 6303.38] so I don't care
[6303.38 → 6303.90] okay
[6303.90 → 6304.48] okay
[6304.48 → 6306.72] so we're filming a video for Patriot
[6306.72 → 6307.40] um
[6307.40 → 6309.34] it's another one of the tech cookie videos
[6309.34 → 6310.72] so it's higher production quality
[6310.72 → 6311.38] has like
[6311.38 → 6312.36] storyline
[6312.36 → 6314.04] if you can call it that
[6314.04 → 6316.16] and the idea is that
[6316.16 → 6317.80] Linus and I are needing out
[6317.80 → 6318.86] and chilling on a couch
[6318.86 → 6319.80] he's playing Super Nintendo
[6319.80 → 6320.78] I'm reading on a tablet
[6320.78 → 6322.68] and then we find this thing called
[6322.68 → 6323.66] the adventurer's wiki
[6323.66 → 6324.92] and decide to go on an adventure
[6324.92 → 6325.80] so
[6325.80 → 6327.28] we go out into the forest
[6327.28 → 6328.02] and film us
[6328.02 → 6328.92] kind of going around
[6328.92 → 6329.54] doing whatever
[6329.54 → 6330.84] and then
[6330.84 → 6331.88] um
[6331.88 → 6334.28] the idea is
[6334.28 → 6335.66] once we're done travelling
[6335.66 → 6336.44] to our destination
[6336.44 → 6337.80] we sit down
[6337.80 → 6338.90] pull out some food
[6338.90 → 6339.34] do whatever
[6339.34 → 6340.18] and then talk about
[6340.18 → 6341.00] what we're going to do next
[6341.00 → 6343.00] and kind of go into a daydream sequence
[6343.00 → 6344.32] about doing manly things
[6344.32 → 6345.52] because that's what the adventure wiki
[6345.52 → 6346.24] is a part of
[6346.24 → 6347.18] um
[6347.18 → 6348.36] and just go around
[6348.36 → 6348.64] like
[6348.64 → 6350.28] we threw an axe at stuff
[6350.28 → 6351.34] we jumped over stuff
[6351.34 → 6352.06] we climbed stuff
[6352.06 → 6353.24] like we do manly things
[6353.24 → 6354.44] but it's just a dream sequence
[6354.44 → 6355.76] and then we snap out of it
[6355.76 → 6356.86] and decide we're just going to watch
[6356.86 → 6357.38] movies
[6357.38 → 6358.32] and then that's where
[6358.32 → 6359.76] the Patriot thing
[6359.76 → 6360.32] comes
[6360.32 → 6361.84] comes into play
[6361.84 → 6363.48] and allows us to actually see our content
[6363.48 → 6364.48] so
[6364.48 → 6365.36] yeah
[6365.36 → 6366.40] that'll come out
[6366.40 → 6367.86] apparently we're introducing
[6367.86 → 6368.64] the newest member
[6368.64 → 6369.46] of the Tech Tips group
[6369.46 → 6369.72] oh cool
[6369.72 → 6371.10] hello
[6371.10 → 6373.08] so this is our
[6373.08 → 6374.38] this is our newest member
[6374.38 → 6375.70] of Linus Media Group
[6375.70 → 6377.40] so he is
[6377.40 → 6377.70] uh
[6377.70 → 6378.28] the assistant
[6378.28 → 6379.76] to Diesel the Intern
[6379.76 → 6380.74] oh it's like a weird
[6380.74 → 6382.22] it's delay
[6382.22 → 6383.34] you probably don't want to look at it
[6383.34 → 6383.54] yeah yeah yeah
[6383.54 → 6384.20] yeah no
[6384.20 → 6384.70] this is
[6384.70 → 6385.48] this is him
[6385.48 → 6387.06] watching them watch us
[6387.06 → 6387.58] basically
[6387.58 → 6388.16] it's like
[6388.16 → 6388.18] nice
[6388.18 → 6389.74] sort of creep-tactic
[6389.74 → 6391.32] so say hi to the viewers
[6391.32 → 6392.22] hi
[6392.22 → 6393.52] I hope you guys like
[6393.52 → 6395.46] everything that you're watching so far
[6395.46 → 6396.90] wow
[6396.90 → 6399.28] just wow man
[6399.28 → 6399.98] oh
[6399.98 → 6401.60] he was a big part of the video
[6401.60 → 6402.40] that I was just talking about
[6402.40 → 6403.06] the Patriot video
[6403.06 → 6403.52] yeah
[6403.52 → 6404.42] hopefully that turns out well
[6404.42 → 6405.16] yeah
[6405.16 → 6406.26] no it did turn out well
[6406.26 → 6407.90] have you seen the finished one yet
[6407.90 → 6408.60] no I haven't
[6408.60 → 6409.12] oh
[6409.12 → 6411.40] have you even seen the cut together one
[6411.40 → 6413.54] oh I saw like the first half of it
[6413.54 → 6414.02] no
[6414.02 → 6415.20] you haven't seen it yet
[6415.20 → 6415.30] no
[6415.30 → 6416.60] oh it's awesome
[6416.60 → 6417.66] I'll see what everyone else does
[6417.66 → 6418.32] yeah okay
[6418.32 → 6418.76] all right
[6418.76 → 6419.48] yeah
[6419.48 → 6421.88] that's the thing about the guys who operate the camera
[6421.88 → 6422.32] goodnight
[6422.32 → 6425.14] is a lot of the time they actually don't
[6425.14 → 6427.80] get to see the fruit of their labours until
[6427.80 → 6429.54] like
[6429.54 → 6430.56] yeah
[6430.56 → 6431.52] it's got to go through editing
[6431.52 → 6431.90] yeah
[6431.90 → 6434.52] and Diesel's still our main
[6434.52 → 6435.54] editor-in-chief
[6435.54 → 6436.84] primo editing guy
[6436.84 → 6439.48] does he even have a job title?
[6441.88 → 6442.50] does he?
[6442.76 → 6443.18] do I?
[6443.34 → 6443.70] do you?
[6444.18 → 6444.50] do I?
[6444.50 → 6444.62] do you?
[6445.98 → 6446.16] does
[6446.16 → 6447.42] well I call myself
[6447.42 → 6448.36] president and CEO
[6448.36 → 6449.90] that's
[6449.90 → 6451.20] fine and dandy
[6451.20 → 6452.24] does he?
[6453.08 → 6455.40] I think he's assistant to Diesel the intern
[6455.40 → 6457.38] so Diesel is intern
[6457.38 → 6458.64] that's his job title
[6458.64 → 6459.52] yeah
[6459.52 → 6461.16] that's not really a job title
[6461.16 → 6462.24] and it's not what he actually is
[6462.24 → 6464.00] because he doesn't actually fetch coffee
[6464.00 → 6465.62] and he's not actually an intern
[6465.62 → 6467.02] yeah he's not actually an intern
[6467.02 → 6468.02] hmm
[6468.02 → 6470.68] fascinating
[6470.68 → 6478.24] do you have to be a
[6478.24 → 6480.60] like officially public company to be a CEO?
[6481.38 → 6481.70] no
[6481.70 → 6482.96] you don't have to be public
[6482.96 → 6484.44] but I think
[6484.44 → 6485.90] is it just corporation?
[6485.90 → 6487.34] yeah you should be incorporated I think
[6487.34 → 6489.28] so it's just incorporated makes it so you're your CEO
[6489.28 → 6493.88] well I guess you could make yourself the CEO of your own privately held company
[6493.88 → 6497.22] like individual business if you wanted to
[6497.22 → 6499.06] you could make yourself whatever title you want
[6499.06 → 6502.90] but I don't remember what the rules are
[6502.90 → 6503.98] like you know how there are directors
[6503.98 → 6505.38] and that's like an official thing
[6505.38 → 6507.14] not just like a placed title
[6507.14 → 6508.66] is CEO an official thing
[6508.66 → 6510.16] or is that a placed title?
[6510.56 → 6511.00] I think so
[6511.00 → 6512.56] I don't remember anymore
[6512.56 → 6514.82] doesn't really matter
[6514.82 → 6516.58] I looked all this stuff up back when
[6516.58 → 6517.64] when you were starting it
[6517.64 → 6518.76] back when I was starting it
[6518.76 → 6519.04] when it mattered
[6519.04 → 6520.52] and that was like five months ago
[6520.52 → 6522.32] and by now my brain's just gone
[6522.32 → 6523.54] blew and flushed it away
[6523.54 → 6524.50] blew I don't care
[6524.50 → 6527.46] why aren't you having any pickles?
[6527.70 → 6528.26] they're delicious
[6528.26 → 6529.56] because I don't want to be rude
[6529.56 → 6530.50] and eat on the live stream
[6530.50 → 6535.24] but they're so good
[6535.24 → 6536.24] but I don't want to be rude
[6536.24 → 6537.18] and eat on the live stream
[6537.18 → 6537.94] I don't think they care
[6537.94 → 6538.76] I
[6538.76 → 6541.14] actually I'm pretty sure some of them do
[6541.14 → 6542.68] but you know what
[6542.68 → 6544.38] I worked all day today
[6544.38 → 6546.70] I worked all week this week
[6546.70 → 6547.76] in spite of being sick
[6547.76 → 6548.52] and
[6548.52 → 6548.80] you know what
[6548.80 → 6550.54] they probably worked all week this week too
[6550.54 → 6551.50] I earned this pickle
[6551.50 → 6556.60] they probably worked all week this week too
[6556.60 → 6558.30] and I bet you some of them were sick
[6558.30 → 6559.08] while they were doing it
[6559.08 → 6560.32] probably more sick than you
[6560.32 → 6562.08] there's at least one dude out there
[6562.08 → 6563.54] that's more sick and worked all week
[6563.54 → 6565.24] and is watching this live stream
[6565.24 → 6566.40] and his throat hurts
[6566.40 → 6567.36] and he can't anything
[6567.36 → 6568.34] but he's hungry
[6568.34 → 6569.54] and he's pretty upset
[6569.54 → 6570.40] that you're eating a pickle
[6570.40 → 6571.76] pretty upset that I'm eating a pickle
[6571.76 → 6574.18] how many of our viewers think it's weird
[6574.18 → 6575.36] to just sit and eat pickles
[6575.36 → 6577.46] do you know that that's actually a thing
[6577.46 → 6578.28] people think is weird
[6578.28 → 6580.96] like people think that pickles
[6580.96 → 6582.96] are just for like putting on other stuff
[6582.96 → 6585.24] no I love pickles
[6585.24 → 6586.74] they have to be the right ones
[6586.74 → 6587.76] yeah like lots
[6587.76 → 6588.76] most pickles are gross
[6588.76 → 6589.08] yeah
[6589.08 → 6589.78] yeah
[6589.78 → 6592.78] there's like specific pickles
[6592.78 → 6593.74] that are really, really good
[6593.74 → 6594.50] to just chomp on
[6594.50 → 6597.10] but most of them suck
[6597.10 → 6598.66] wow
[6598.66 → 6602.64] I didn't even think that was that close
[6602.64 → 6603.94] wow just wow
[6603.94 → 6604.80] I said chomp
[6604.80 → 6606.06] yeah I don't know
[6606.06 → 6606.78] whatever man
[6606.78 → 6607.86] that wasn't even that close
[6607.86 → 6608.20] okay
[6608.20 → 6609.28] you can't spin that properly
[6609.28 → 6609.56] all right
[6609.56 → 6610.00] okay
[6610.00 → 6610.42] yeah
[6610.42 → 6610.96] okay
[6610.96 → 6611.84] um
[6611.84 → 6613.62] so anyway
[6613.62 → 6614.54] let's see
[6614.54 → 6615.68] let's see if anyone on
[6615.68 → 6616.98] on Twitter is upset
[6616.98 → 6619.26] hmm
[6619.26 → 6622.28] it's David Isaacson's birthday today
[6622.28 → 6623.42] and he's watching our live stream
[6623.42 → 6625.70] happy birthday David Isaacson
[6625.70 → 6626.80] happy birthday indeed
[6626.80 → 6628.50] that's a case
[6628.50 → 6630.08] I don't really have anything else
[6630.08 → 6631.10] to talk about at this point
[6631.10 → 6632.32] um
[6632.32 → 6633.46] we're doing issue 20 next week
[6633.46 → 6634.54] oh yeah
[6634.54 → 6635.20] that's uh
[6635.20 → 6636.10] that's something that's nice
[6636.10 → 6636.84] to kind of get done
[6636.84 → 6637.84] uh
[6637.84 → 6639.22] 7790
[6639.22 → 6640.38] mm-hmm
[6640.38 → 6641.28] hopefully
[6641.28 → 6642.06] hopefully
[6642.06 → 6643.02] we should be able
[6643.02 → 6643.96] yeah I should have time
[6643.96 → 6644.80] oh no we will
[6644.80 → 6646.20] because we actually have a card now
[6646.20 → 6646.52] yeah
[6646.52 → 6648.50] we should kind of have a card
[6648.50 → 6649.90] yeah we have uh
[6649.90 → 6650.88] we have a MSI card
[6650.88 → 6652.24] temporarily maybe have a card
[6652.24 → 6654.02] yeah we temporarily have a MSI card
[6654.02 → 6655.16] we were supposed to get
[6655.16 → 6656.34] a card from Asus
[6656.34 → 6657.28] but it hasn't uh
[6657.28 → 6658.56] hasn't materialized yet
[6658.56 → 6658.98] so
[6658.98 → 6662.16] we'll be um
[6662.16 → 6663.16] we'll be pretty happy
[6663.16 → 6664.60] to bring you sort of that
[6664.60 → 6666.12] once we have it
[6666.12 → 6667.12] um
[6667.12 → 6668.34] someone brings up
[6668.34 → 6669.22] that it was actually
[6669.22 → 6670.90] the BP thing was caused
[6670.90 → 6672.26] by Halliburton's concrete
[6672.26 → 6672.68] so
[6672.68 → 6673.42] okay fine
[6673.42 → 6674.70] then Halliburton's a bad company
[6674.70 → 6675.24] it doesn't matter
[6675.24 → 6675.62] someone
[6675.62 → 6676.56] anyone who knew
[6676.56 → 6677.82] ahead of time
[6677.82 → 6678.64] that that was bad
[6678.64 → 6679.34] um
[6679.34 → 6680.16] is worse than Ea
[6680.16 → 6681.76] I don't really eat pickles
[6681.76 → 6682.22] that often
[6682.22 → 6682.90] but I do the same
[6682.90 → 6683.78] with hot dog sausages
[6683.78 → 6685.34] I think lots of people
[6685.34 → 6686.30] just eat hot dogs
[6686.30 → 6687.92] in fact it's like
[6687.92 → 6688.54] pretty common
[6688.54 → 6689.52] like especially for
[6689.52 → 6689.58] pickles
[6689.58 → 6690.94] pickles you can just whip
[6690.94 → 6691.52] out of the fridge
[6691.52 → 6692.74] no like hot dogs and ketchup
[6692.74 → 6693.78] oh cold hot dogs
[6693.78 → 6694.94] oh I do cold hot dogs
[6694.94 → 6695.12] really
[6696.12 → 6697.80] it's not dangerous
[6697.80 → 6698.54] I just don't think
[6698.54 → 6698.98] it would be very
[6698.98 → 6700.00] like it tastes better
[6700.00 → 6700.50] when it's warm
[6700.50 → 6701.02] well I mean it's not
[6701.02 → 6701.60] any more dangerous
[6701.60 → 6702.68] than any other hot dog
[6702.68 → 6704.60] I'm convinced that
[6704.60 → 6705.92] hot dogs do kill you
[6705.92 → 6706.90] they're terrible
[6706.90 → 6707.68] yeah
[6707.68 → 6709.72] simple bob says
[6709.72 → 6711.06] force slick to eat the pickle
[6711.06 → 6712.68] that is the worst advice
[6712.68 → 6713.84] I've ever heard
[6713.84 → 6717.46] I mean that's going to be illegal
[6717.46 → 6722.00] live stream where we talk
[6722.00 → 6723.36] about donating testicles
[6723.36 → 6724.22] to be Gabe Newell's
[6724.22 → 6725.42] apprentice and eating pickles
[6725.42 → 6727.22] um
[6727.22 → 6728.50] Joe
[6728.50 → 6729.50] Joe
[6729.50 → 6731.14] Vicente
[6731.14 → 6732.10] Wayland
[6732.10 → 6733.32] wow
[6733.32 → 6734.24] John M.
[6734.40 → 6734.88] Wound
[6734.88 → 6735.64] or Wound
[6735.64 → 6736.10] okay
[6736.10 → 6736.82] John
[6736.82 → 6737.58] uh
[6737.58 → 6738.70] RAM capacity
[6738.70 → 6740.94] versus speed for gaming
[6740.94 → 6741.74] and working
[6741.74 → 6742.38] please
[6742.38 → 6746.18] I don't
[6746.18 → 6747.16] I don't follow cars
[6747.16 → 6747.52] sorry
[6747.52 → 6748.66] I couldn't possibly care
[6748.66 → 6749.84] it's some other car
[6749.84 → 6750.64] that absolutely
[6750.64 → 6751.52] no one can afford
[6751.52 → 6752.18] and
[6752.18 → 6753.32] it probably looks really nice
[6753.32 → 6754.34] it probably goes really fast
[6754.34 → 6755.60] and I'll probably never afford it
[6755.60 → 6755.90] yeah
[6755.90 → 6756.60] um
[6756.60 → 6757.14] that's for RAM
[6757.14 → 6758.74] get 8 gigs of something that runs
[6758.74 → 6759.88] yeah
[6759.88 → 6761.86] unless you're doing
[6761.86 → 6762.82] sort of pro work
[6762.82 → 6763.68] like video editing
[6763.68 → 6764.84] or After Effects
[6764.84 → 6765.74] or APU stuff
[6765.74 → 6766.56] 3D rendering
[6766.56 → 6767.02] or
[6767.02 → 6767.60] uh
[6767.60 → 6768.10] yeah honestly
[6768.10 → 6769.10] on an AM APU
[6769.10 → 6769.42] then
[6769.42 → 6770.12] you know
[6770.12 → 6771.20] 1600 megahertz
[6771.20 → 6772.50] 1866 megahertz
[6772.50 → 6773.40] is probably beneficial
[6773.40 → 6774.60] but to give you some idea
[6774.60 → 6775.58] um
[6775.58 → 6776.04] you know
[6776.04 → 6777.50] in Diesel's workstation
[6777.50 → 6778.82] 1333
[6778.82 → 6782.04] he has lots of RAM
[6782.04 → 6783.00] 32 gigs
[6783.00 → 6784.60] but there isn't
[6784.60 → 6785.68] actually a benefit
[6785.68 → 6786.58] to higher speed memory
[6786.58 → 6787.76] for most things
[6787.76 → 6788.84] on the desktop anyway
[6788.84 → 6789.34] because
[6789.34 → 6790.64] the only thing that
[6790.64 → 6791.70] higher frequency does
[6791.70 → 6792.72] is giving you more bandwidth
[6792.72 → 6793.96] and especially
[6793.96 → 6796.16] on these multichannel platforms
[6796.16 → 6796.78] like triple
[6796.78 → 6798.04] quad-channel platforms
[6798.04 → 6798.84] there's
[6798.84 → 6800.02] lots of bandwidth
[6800.02 → 6801.00] for a single CPU
[6801.00 → 6802.16] anyway
[6802.16 → 6803.54] so it's uh
[6803.54 → 6804.34] it's not
[6804.34 → 6805.48] it's not a big deal
[6805.48 → 6806.82] um
[6806.82 → 6808.50] what happened to RAM prices
[6808.50 → 6809.34] someone asks
[6809.34 → 6810.80] every once in a while
[6810.80 → 6812.26] RAM prices go up
[6812.26 → 6813.26] I think they're allocating
[6813.26 → 6814.30] more of the fab time
[6814.30 → 6815.28] to other stuff
[6815.28 → 6816.68] it usually happens
[6816.68 → 6817.40] leading up into
[6817.40 → 6818.84] every summer
[6818.84 → 6820.18] as the manufacturers
[6820.18 → 6821.70] move over to more flash
[6821.70 → 6822.50] because people are gonna
[6822.50 → 6823.60] buy SD cards
[6823.60 → 6825.14] so that they can take
[6825.14 → 6825.82] pictures
[6825.82 → 6827.64] and that kind of stuff
[6827.64 → 6828.48] companies decide
[6828.48 → 6829.50] that they want to make
[6829.50 → 6830.62] more than five cents
[6830.62 → 6831.24] per dim
[6831.24 → 6832.40] yeah
[6832.40 → 6834.12] mind you
[6834.12 → 6836.50] usually it isn't even that
[6836.50 → 6837.66] apparently we're cool
[6837.66 → 6838.56] and he loves pickles
[6838.56 → 6839.00] says
[6839.00 → 6841.08] ASIA on YouTube
[6841.08 → 6842.86] where do you get
[6842.86 → 6844.26] AMD branded coolers
[6844.26 → 6845.40] on AMD graphics cards
[6845.40 → 6846.16] like in the pictures
[6846.16 → 6847.10] on AMD's website
[6847.10 → 6847.68] oh sorry
[6847.68 → 6848.84] I'm not even showing you guys
[6848.84 → 6849.44] these tweets
[6849.44 → 6850.08] what do you mean
[6850.08 → 6850.70] um
[6850.70 → 6851.64] you can't really
[6851.64 → 6852.44] for the most part
[6852.44 → 6853.94] unless you're like
[6853.94 → 6855.14] a reviewer publication
[6855.14 → 6856.06] or someone like us
[6856.06 → 6857.16] then AMD can send it
[6857.16 → 6857.72] to you directly
[6857.72 → 6858.98] is there such thing
[6858.98 → 6859.94] as a cheap gaming PC
[6859.94 → 6860.44] yes
[6860.44 → 6862.38] um
[6862.38 → 6864.06] chomp chomp chomp
[6864.06 → 6864.88] alright
[6864.88 → 6866.38] see no one cares
[6866.38 → 6866.90] about the pickle
[6866.90 → 6868.18] um
[6868.18 → 6869.12] now that it's summers
[6869.12 → 6869.86] you should ride your bike
[6869.86 → 6871.26] actually I'm selling my bike
[6871.26 → 6872.46] even if I don't end up
[6872.46 → 6873.54] getting the 4k monitor
[6873.54 → 6874.68] the bike is uh
[6874.68 → 6876.06] the bike is probably
[6876.06 → 6877.32] done for at this point
[6877.32 → 6878.42] so it's on Craigslist
[6878.42 → 6879.72] as we speak
[6879.72 → 6881.76] that's one way
[6881.76 → 6882.92] to push your ad
[6882.92 → 6883.86] Hunter says
[6883.86 → 6884.46] yeah I know right
[6884.46 → 6885.88] if anyone wants to buy
[6885.88 → 6887.74] a Suzuki SV650S
[6887.74 → 6890.88] 24,000 kilometres
[6890.88 → 6891.68] great condition
[6891.68 → 6892.04] silver
[6892.04 → 6892.62] 2003
[6892.62 → 6894.54] no crashes
[6894.54 → 6895.74] nah several
[6895.74 → 6896.22] no
[6896.22 → 6897.58] insignificant ones
[6897.58 → 6898.32] small ones
[6898.32 → 6899.44] small
[6899.44 → 6902.98] yeah I'm tired
[6902.98 → 6903.58] I'm done
[6903.58 → 6907.14] wow
[6907.14 → 6908.56] wow
[6908.56 → 6910.50] that was fantastic
[6910.50 → 6912.24] what does this think
[6912.24 → 6913.10] apparently we missed
[6913.10 → 6914.24] part of Project Snowflake
[6914.24 → 6916.60] someone freaked out at me
[6916.60 → 6917.86] apparently it's
[6917.86 → 6919.62] all my fault
[6919.62 → 6920.58] and I'm a terrible person
[6920.58 → 6921.86] but we should go to page 4
[6921.86 → 6923.24] um
[6923.24 → 6923.78] okay
[6923.78 → 6926.04] what is this
[6926.04 → 6926.48] oh yeah
[6926.48 → 6927.94] someone's running an GPU
[6927.94 → 6929.68] using Thunderbolt
[6929.68 → 6930.52] and a MacBook Pro
[6930.52 → 6931.56] yes it's possible
[6931.56 → 6932.70] it's just
[6932.70 → 6934.26] mostly kludge solutions
[6934.26 → 6934.84] right now
[6934.84 → 6935.70] it's very DIY
[6935.70 → 6936.58] compared to
[6936.58 → 6937.24] something like
[6937.24 → 6938.42] an external box
[6938.42 → 6939.40] that's actually designed
[6939.40 → 6940.26] for running external
[6940.26 → 6940.94] graphics cards
[6940.94 → 6941.54] over Thunderbolt
[6941.54 → 6943.76] let's go back to Project Snowflake
[6943.76 → 6945.28] let's see this page 4
[6945.28 → 6946.74] page 4
[6946.74 → 6947.88] Project Snowflake
[6947.88 → 6948.54] here we go
[6948.54 → 6949.20] alright
[6949.20 → 6950.10] let's go ahead
[6950.10 → 6951.88] and make that big
[6951.88 → 6953.14] and switch to that
[6953.14 → 6955.08] and
[6955.08 → 6957.46] page 4
[6957.46 → 6958.58] right
[6958.58 → 6959.80] our broken form
[6959.80 → 6961.14] that doesn't work properly
[6961.14 → 6962.20] way to go slick
[6962.20 → 6963.38] uh no
[6963.38 → 6965.26] I'm not taking credit for that
[6965.26 → 6966.38] so probably page 2
[6966.38 → 6967.32] because you probably have more
[6967.32 → 6968.22] pace per page
[6968.22 → 6969.04] oh god
[6969.04 → 6969.74] this is going to be interesting
[6969.74 → 6971.46] uh
[6971.46 → 6979.72] are you logged in?
[6980.12 → 6980.28] yeah
[6980.28 → 6983.14] okay
[6983.14 → 6984.74] so that's back panel
[6984.74 → 6986.72] hard drive
[6986.72 → 6987.46] just use page now
[6987.46 → 6988.86] this works
[6988.86 → 6989.76] fine
[6989.76 → 6990.92] and it doesn't do that
[6990.92 → 6991.62] crazy skipping thing
[6991.62 → 6991.96] that you did
[6991.96 → 6993.24] that's a pretty artistic picture
[6993.24 → 6996.06] nice white fangirls
[6996.06 → 6997.14] how many times have you seen that?
[6997.92 → 6998.42] not often
[6998.42 → 7000.20] I wonder if he painted them
[7000.20 → 7002.46] they look perfect
[7002.46 → 7003.46] oh those are
[7003.46 → 7004.82] what?
[7004.90 → 7006.04] I thought he had different fans
[7006.04 → 7009.30] I was pretty sure
[7009.30 → 7010.16] when I saw them before
[7010.16 → 7011.28] they were a bit phoenix fan
[7011.28 → 7011.94] mm
[7011.94 → 7012.76] remember?
[7013.00 → 7013.84] so those have been changed
[7013.84 → 7014.90] to Corsair SPs?
[7015.14 → 7015.72] apparently they've been changed
[7015.72 → 7016.20] to Corsair SPs
[7016.20 → 7016.88] they look good
[7016.88 → 7019.72] or maybe it's a different part
[7019.72 → 7020.10] of the build
[7020.10 → 7020.60] that has the
[7020.60 → 7021.46] wow white fluid
[7021.46 → 7022.04] very nice
[7022.04 → 7024.78] okay a bunch of things changed
[7024.78 → 7025.46] gorgeous
[7025.46 → 7027.54] whoa
[7027.54 → 7031.00] what's going on there?
[7031.84 → 7032.70] balling res
[7032.70 → 7033.50] with like
[7033.50 → 7034.88] marble white fluid
[7034.88 → 7036.64] I wonder how long that
[7036.64 → 7037.48] white tubing
[7037.48 → 7038.56] I wonder how long that effect
[7038.56 → 7039.10] will last
[7039.10 → 7041.04] sometimes it likes to go away
[7041.04 → 7041.84] mm
[7041.84 → 7044.54] whoa
[7044.54 → 7046.46] that looks so cool
[7046.46 → 7049.32] that does look perfect
[7049.32 → 7051.84] he's also changed his pump now
[7051.84 → 7053.62] he's changed quite a few things
[7053.62 → 7055.08] 30 drops of ocean blue
[7055.08 → 7055.52] apparently
[7055.52 → 7056.80] very cool
[7056.80 → 7060.34] very similar picture
[7060.34 → 7061.12] or the same
[7061.12 → 7061.46] white
[7061.46 → 7062.30] 80-ish drops
[7062.30 → 7063.18] okay so he increased
[7063.18 → 7064.56] that's why it looks a little bit
[7064.56 → 7065.06] more intense
[7065.06 → 7065.38] right
[7065.38 → 7066.54] white painted
[7066.54 → 7069.92] power heat sinks now
[7069.92 → 7071.98] oh yeah
[7071.98 → 7073.98] cool
[7073.98 → 7076.70] yeah
[7076.70 → 7081.08] dip shop
[7081.08 → 7082.02] with full colour
[7082.02 → 7082.88] okay
[7082.88 → 7083.32] cool
[7083.32 → 7085.30] all right
[7085.30 → 7086.10] there we get to see it
[7086.10 → 7087.50] without all the paper towel
[7087.50 → 7087.98] all over it
[7087.98 → 7088.36] beautiful
[7088.36 → 7089.16] that's awesome
[7089.16 → 7090.44] looks great in the SLI bridge
[7090.44 → 7090.76] as well
[7090.76 → 7091.98] looks so good
[7091.98 → 7093.14] that's really, really cool
[7093.14 → 7093.40] in fact
[7093.40 → 7095.02] he ditched the water cooling
[7095.02 → 7095.42] on ramp
[7095.42 → 7096.62] oh okay
[7096.62 → 7098.02] which I actually might have liked to see
[7098.02 → 7098.56] just because
[7098.56 → 7100.52] not because of anything to do with performance
[7100.52 → 7101.62] just because it's like
[7101.62 → 7102.50] looks awesome
[7102.50 → 7104.24] but he might have done that for cable runs or something
[7104.24 → 7106.62] why do I keep on saying cable runs
[7106.62 → 7107.30] tubing runs
[7107.30 → 7109.42] that looks pretty cool
[7109.42 → 7110.70] that's outstanding
[7110.70 → 7116.96] finished
[7116.96 → 7120.26] the computer was off
[7120.26 → 7121.78] that's why it's not swirling so much
[7121.78 → 7122.66] right
[7122.66 → 7124.56] some of those runs are nice
[7124.56 → 7126.14] I can see that cable going right through there
[7126.14 → 7128.74] I think part of what makes the swirling effect work for him
[7128.74 → 7130.42] is the fact that he has such a tall re
[7130.42 → 7131.66] yeah it's just huge
[7131.66 → 7134.78] so that'll keep it from agitating so much
[7134.78 → 7136.00] that the effect just goes away
[7136.00 → 7137.04] especially up near the top
[7137.04 → 7137.66] that's very cool
[7137.66 → 7138.22] yeah
[7138.22 → 7138.92] there you go
[7138.92 → 7139.44] see that
[7139.44 → 7140.92] because you can see at the bottom
[7140.92 → 7141.88] it doesn't look good at all
[7141.88 → 7143.94] but then up near the top of the res
[7143.94 → 7145.84] it gets that really cool looking effect
[7145.84 → 7146.12] yeah for sure
[7146.12 → 7149.40] wow that's really cool
[7149.40 → 7151.50] are the wires by the power supply
[7151.50 → 7152.74] going through individual holes
[7152.74 → 7154.04] that's ridiculous
[7154.04 → 7155.82] did he make those?
[7156.10 → 7156.42] not to
[7156.42 → 7158.52] did he change his case?
[7159.84 → 7161.84] he was a switch 810
[7161.84 → 7162.76] at the beginning
[7162.76 → 7163.56] I think
[7163.56 → 7166.82] huh
[7166.82 → 7168.10] very cool build
[7168.10 → 7169.64] he changed a lot of things
[7169.64 → 7171.52] I think that's still a switch 810
[7171.52 → 7172.56] yeah okay
[7172.56 → 7173.94] he just must have modded out
[7173.94 → 7175.00] this part where the rod is
[7175.00 → 7177.28] because he had the angular fan there before
[7177.28 → 7178.28] mm-hmm
[7178.28 → 7180.38] power supply looks great now
[7180.38 → 7183.92] I don't think he had like the white plate and stuff on it before
[7183.92 → 7188.20] because that's his 1200 eye still
[7188.20 → 7191.22] wow
[7191.22 → 7192.78] shouldn't drink that
[7192.78 → 7196.84] oh he's changing his liquid
[7196.84 → 7198.40] I know he said before
[7198.40 → 7200.70] that the swirl effect was kind of going away after time
[7200.70 → 7202.10] but it still looked perfect
[7202.10 → 7203.22] because remember when you were like
[7203.22 → 7204.74] you can't really tell at the bottom quite as much
[7204.74 → 7206.76] that's where he said the swirl effect was going away
[7206.76 → 7208.28] but it still looked perfect
[7208.28 → 7208.68] right
[7208.68 → 7210.16] but anyway he's looking at different fluid
[7210.16 → 7211.76] with a white build like this
[7211.76 → 7214.54] where the only colour realistically is coming from the fluid
[7214.54 → 7215.48] changing out your fluid
[7215.48 → 7217.76] like
[7217.76 → 7218.64] waters
[7218.64 → 7219.48] that's cool I guess
[7219.48 → 7221.92] both of those look great
[7221.92 → 7223.18] I like the blueberry
[7223.18 → 7224.44] so do I yeah
[7224.44 → 7225.70] but they both look great
[7225.70 → 7228.32] oh that's cool
[7228.32 → 7231.82] new liquid
[7231.82 → 7232.86] apparently he went with blueberry
[7232.86 → 7234.18] alright
[7234.18 → 7235.08] perfect
[7235.08 → 7236.32] I don't think that looks as good
[7236.32 → 7236.82] even without
[7236.82 → 7238.40] no I like the swirls
[7238.40 → 7238.96] yeah me too
[7238.96 → 7240.56] it still looks perfect
[7240.56 → 7242.78] huh
[7242.78 → 7243.32] cool
[7243.32 → 7244.54] I'm happy we went back to that
[7244.54 → 7246.60] I don't know how to change back to your thing
[7246.60 → 7247.42] so there you go
[7247.42 → 7248.02] function one
[7248.02 → 7249.02] book
[7249.02 → 7251.12] there we go
[7251.12 → 7256.44] see even when I say like I'm done
[7256.44 → 7257.38] and I'm like leaving
[7257.38 → 7259.10] everyone just stays and keeps watching
[7259.10 → 7260.18] thank you guys
[7260.18 → 7261.50] we appreciate it
[7261.50 → 7262.12] we do
[7262.12 → 7265.06] do we have any interesting like Linus Media Group stuff to talk about
[7265.06 → 7266.64] other than introducing our new employee
[7266.64 → 7268.54] we have another one
[7268.54 → 7271.02] yeah we have an intern starting on Monday
[7271.02 → 7273.74] we haven't come up with a nickname for him yet
[7273.74 → 7275.26] but I'm thinking Engine
[7275.26 → 7277.46] that's not bad
[7277.46 → 7280.92] I came up with it just now
[7280.92 → 7284.14] it might be Engine
[7284.14 → 7284.58] yeah
[7284.58 → 7285.20] it might be
[7285.20 → 7286.66] I think it's probably going to be Engine
[7286.66 → 7288.46] there it's Engine
[7288.46 → 7290.08] so Engine is starting on Monday
[7290.08 → 7294.08] oh my goodness
[7294.08 → 7295.90] yeah
[7295.90 → 7297.36] Engine is starting on Monday
[7297.36 → 7297.96] that's cool
[7297.96 → 7298.80] that's going to be cool
[7298.80 → 7300.82] I have to build him a workstation
[7300.82 → 7304.04] we're such a sausage fest
[7304.04 → 7305.46] we're going to be five dudes
[7305.46 → 7309.22] we're doing computer hardware videos
[7309.22 → 7309.66] right
[7309.66 → 7311.04] what do you want
[7311.04 → 7314.82] do I have to be the one who represents our female viewers
[7314.82 → 7316.62] and comes and calls you out
[7316.62 → 7317.56] for the first time ever
[7317.56 → 7319.36] if we get an applicant
[7319.36 → 7319.92] no you know what
[7319.92 → 7322.56] every time I talk about how no females watch our show
[7322.56 → 7324.36] one of them like tweets at me
[7324.36 → 7326.16] if we ever get a female applicant
[7326.16 → 7327.58] I have no idea who this is
[7327.58 → 7328.54] so I'm just going to answer it
[7328.54 → 7330.54] you're live online as Tech Tips
[7330.54 → 7337.00] hello
[7337.00 → 7339.48] is it just dead
[7339.48 → 7341.42] they may be stunned
[7341.42 → 7343.12] maybe they'll call back
[7343.12 → 7345.86] okay
[7345.86 → 7349.02] if we ever get a female applicant
[7349.02 → 7350.98] for any position we've ever posted
[7350.98 → 7353.54] then there you go
[7353.54 → 7355.46] I don't know what else to say
[7355.46 → 7356.40] it's never happened
[7356.40 → 7359.26] so female viewers aside
[7359.26 → 7361.10] which I do try and sometimes defend
[7361.10 → 7363.70] we have never had a female applicant
[7363.70 → 7366.44] so they don't actually exist
[7366.44 → 7368.14] yeah we haven't
[7368.14 → 7368.44] no
[7368.44 → 7368.96] actually
[7368.96 → 7371.72] so that demographic actually doesn't exist
[7371.72 → 7373.70] who is this
[7373.70 → 7374.46] I don't know
[7374.46 → 7376.80] you're online as Tech Tips Live
[7376.80 → 7379.40] hello
[7379.40 → 7380.02] hello
[7380.02 → 7391.40] hello
[7391.40 → 7392.16] hello Linus
[7392.16 → 7393.58] bye
[7393.58 → 7395.34] I have a weird feeling
[7395.34 → 7396.16] it's Mr. Wizard
[7396.16 → 7398.32] uh
[7398.32 → 7399.44] what's his number
[7399.44 → 7402.60] let me figure this out
[7402.60 → 7403.80] he's not responding
[7403.80 → 7405.28] but I actually think it's Mr. Wizard
[7405.28 → 7406.84] for any amount of backlog
[7406.84 → 7408.38] Mr. Wizard is my
[7408.38 → 7410.16] admin helper sir
[7410.16 → 7411.30] that goes on
[7411.30 → 7411.92] the forum
[7411.92 → 7412.90] and it's the only reason
[7412.90 → 7413.94] that our kludge solution
[7413.94 → 7414.44] of a forum
[7414.44 → 7415.48] is even currently running
[7415.48 → 7416.86] calling again
[7416.86 → 7417.22] no, no
[7417.22 → 7418.24] this is someone new
[7418.24 → 7419.88] see he could be calling
[7419.88 → 7420.34] from his
[7420.34 → 7423.50] caller you're live online
[7423.50 → 7424.04] as Tech Tips
[7424.04 → 7430.50] oh that didn't work
[7430.50 → 7432.86] unless that's another one
[7432.86 → 7434.50] oh boy
[7434.50 → 7436.00] this is out of control
[7436.00 → 7436.86] oh my goodness
[7436.86 → 7437.70] what the heck
[7437.70 → 7439.40] uh okay
[7439.40 → 7439.80] so anyway
[7439.80 → 7440.56] this is the uh
[7440.56 → 7441.20] this is the one
[7441.20 → 7447.98] oh no
[7447.98 → 7448.96] lol
[7448.96 → 7450.16] oh no
[7450.16 → 7451.64] that's what it actually is
[7451.64 → 7452.32] yeah that's what happened
[7452.32 → 7454.02] you're never going to stop
[7454.02 → 7454.86] getting phone calls
[7454.86 → 7455.34] yeah
[7455.34 → 7456.20] oh that's
[7456.20 → 7457.28] that's the end of that
[7457.28 → 7460.82] oh god
[7460.82 → 7466.62] and that was when
[7466.62 → 7467.48] he changed his number
[7467.48 → 7469.46] yeah you probably have to
[7469.46 → 7469.74] yeah
[7469.74 → 7471.32] alright well
[7471.32 → 7472.60] I'll have a new number
[7472.60 → 7473.58] sometime next week
[7473.58 → 7473.96] I guess
[7473.96 → 7474.76] but that was fun
[7474.76 → 7475.32] while it lasted
[7475.32 → 7478.56] come on
[7478.56 → 7478.84] like
[7478.84 → 7479.84] oh
[7479.84 → 7480.60] why
[7480.60 → 7483.22] why would you
[7483.22 → 7484.36] actually call
[7484.36 → 7486.06] not to like
[7486.06 → 7487.48] directly attack people
[7487.48 → 7488.06] that are possibly
[7488.06 → 7488.86] watching right now
[7488.86 → 7489.72] but why would you
[7489.72 → 7490.84] actually call
[7490.84 → 7493.06] like man
[7493.06 → 7493.90] and if you're gonna call
[7493.90 → 7495.10] at least have your phone work
[7495.10 → 7496.52] yeah they wanted to be online
[7496.52 → 7497.04] as Tech Tips
[7497.04 → 7498.20] I can't really blame them
[7498.20 → 7498.76] but okay
[7498.76 → 7501.16] at least have your phone work
[7501.16 → 7501.84] for one
[7501.84 → 7502.64] and for two
[7502.64 → 7503.86] say something
[7503.86 → 7505.50] like
[7505.50 → 7507.02] you're the one person
[7507.02 → 7507.94] that got through
[7507.94 → 7508.76] it's like
[7508.76 → 7509.46] it's like
[7509.46 → 7510.52] calling
[7510.52 → 7510.90] it's like
[7510.90 → 7511.46] hi
[7511.46 → 7518.18] like
[7518.18 → 7518.84] say something
[7518.84 → 7519.78] if you're going to troll
[7519.78 → 7520.96] at least be successful
[7520.96 → 7521.50] yeah
[7521.50 → 7524.00] at least actually troll us
[7524.00 → 7524.60] in some way
[7524.60 → 7526.14] instead of just
[7526.14 → 7526.92] spamming a phone
[7526.92 → 7528.40] at least actually buy my bike
[7528.40 → 7532.86] you're going to go to the ad
[7532.86 → 7533.64] to buy it at least
[7533.64 → 7533.96] yeah
[7533.96 → 7534.90] man I really thought
[7534.90 → 7535.94] that was Mr. Wizard
[7535.94 → 7537.28] because he always says that
[7537.28 → 7537.54] he's like
[7537.54 → 7538.64] oh I'm going to get drunk
[7538.64 → 7539.32] and call in
[7539.32 → 7540.30] and troll you guys
[7540.30 → 7541.22] and I'm like
[7541.22 → 7541.98] no you're not
[7541.98 → 7543.84] you probably will actually
[7543.84 → 7544.44] at some point
[7544.44 → 7545.06] at some point
[7545.06 → 7546.62] I'm so annoyed
[7546.62 → 7547.60] that the stream died
[7547.60 → 7548.40] in the middle tonight
[7548.40 → 7549.18] because it means
[7549.18 → 7550.02] I'm going to have to use
[7550.02 → 7551.14] Windows Live Movie Maker
[7551.14 → 7551.96] to fix it again
[7551.96 → 7554.04] which is just so pathetic
[7554.04 → 7555.20] and you know what this means
[7555.20 → 7556.54] this means now
[7556.54 → 7557.78] on top of all the other
[7557.78 → 7558.84] like ritualistic things
[7558.84 → 7559.76] that we do before the stream
[7559.76 → 7560.66] to make sure things work
[7560.66 → 7562.14] like switching on and off
[7562.14 → 7563.38] what is it even called
[7563.38 → 7564.36] attenuation
[7564.36 → 7565.46] attenuation on the mic
[7565.46 → 7566.52] so it actually sounds proper
[7566.52 → 7568.40] and like all that crap
[7568.40 → 7569.50] to just turn things off
[7569.50 → 7569.96] and on again
[7569.96 → 7570.72] to make sure they work
[7570.72 → 7571.78] now we have to like
[7571.78 → 7572.52] reset the router
[7572.52 → 7573.28] every single time
[7573.28 → 7573.88] we do a stream
[7573.88 → 7574.94] you know what
[7574.94 → 7575.88] it's been flaking out
[7575.88 → 7576.36] a little bit
[7576.36 → 7577.68] over the last little while
[7577.68 → 7580.64] so I guess it was just due
[7580.64 → 7583.36] but still like
[7583.36 → 7585.06] we just need to switch
[7585.06 → 7586.62] to a DDWRT router
[7586.62 → 7587.60] and be done with it
[7587.60 → 7589.24] we gave the last one
[7589.24 → 7590.12] we had speaking of
[7590.12 → 7591.12] Mr. Wizard to him
[7591.12 → 7591.50] so
[7591.50 → 7594.20] yeah that was like
[7594.20 → 7594.66] a compatible
[7594.66 → 7595.58] it was a buffalo one
[7595.58 → 7596.26] it had like
[7596.26 → 7597.86] Uber powerful antennas
[7597.86 → 7599.52] and was DDWRT
[7599.52 → 7599.92] although
[7599.92 → 7601.72] we have one of the new
[7601.72 → 7603.86] Links EA6500s coming
[7603.86 → 7604.60] oh cool
[7604.60 → 7605.64] so that's their AC router
[7605.64 → 7606.34] I'm really excited
[7606.34 → 7606.86] to try it out
[7606.86 → 7607.82] with the HTC One
[7607.82 → 7609.94] because it does support
[7609.94 → 7610.60] wireless AC
[7610.60 → 7611.42] right
[7611.42 → 7612.86] which is awesome
[7612.86 → 7614.82] and so does HTC One
[7614.82 → 7615.62] although I'm kind of
[7615.62 → 7616.24] skeptical about
[7616.24 → 7617.36] wireless AC on phones
[7617.36 → 7618.44] apparently
[7618.44 → 7619.70] an Aztec saw
[7619.70 → 7622.46] up to 285 megabit
[7622.46 → 7623.52] real world
[7623.52 → 7624.52] throughput
[7624.52 → 7625.24] have they done
[7625.24 → 7625.72] S4 yet?
[7626.02 → 7626.50] I don't know
[7626.50 → 7628.10] but S4 is AC as well
[7628.10 → 7629.06] using the same chipset
[7629.06 → 7629.70] so it'll probably be
[7629.70 → 7629.96] similar
[7629.96 → 7632.06] but that's outstanding
[7632.06 → 7633.08] that's huge
[7633.08 → 7634.56] speaking of the HTC One
[7634.56 → 7635.54] and the Aztec review
[7635.54 → 7636.96] go to Aztec
[7636.96 → 7639.80] because their review
[7639.80 → 7640.50] is outstanding
[7640.50 → 7641.54] and the phone is
[7641.54 → 7642.04] outstanding
[7642.04 → 7643.40] and it's absolutely
[7643.40 → 7643.90] awesome
[7643.90 → 7645.26] so yes
[7645.26 → 7645.90] go there
[7645.90 → 7646.70] read the review
[7646.70 → 7648.36] it's an awesome phone
[7648.36 → 7650.90] and it pretty much
[7650.90 → 7652.16] negates any reason
[7652.16 → 7652.82] you might have
[7652.82 → 7653.68] for buying an S4
[7653.68 → 7654.80] unless you really
[7654.80 → 7656.20] need that micro SD slot
[7656.20 → 7657.62] and you really plan
[7657.62 → 7658.54] to replace your battery
[7658.54 → 7659.14] at some point
[7659.14 → 7659.92] speaking of which
[7659.92 → 7660.82] how's your S3 battery
[7660.82 → 7661.30] holding out?
[7661.58 → 7662.22] it came back
[7662.22 → 7662.98] did I talk to you about this?
[7662.98 → 7663.82] did it come back to life?
[7664.04 → 7665.06] like now it lasts
[7665.06 → 7665.94] again for like
[7665.94 → 7666.62] two days
[7666.62 → 7668.72] with very mild use
[7668.72 → 7669.42] I don't use my phone
[7669.42 → 7669.76] that much
[7669.76 → 7670.94] for like two days
[7670.94 → 7672.10] that's with like
[7672.10 → 7674.00] on my phone
[7674.00 → 7674.68] for about half an hour
[7674.68 → 7675.10] every night
[7675.10 → 7675.96] right as I go to bed
[7675.96 → 7677.02] and like texting
[7677.02 → 7677.48] throughout the day
[7677.48 → 7677.98] a little bit
[7677.98 → 7678.66] but not a ton
[7678.66 → 7680.66] very mild anything else
[7680.66 → 7681.30] I probably didn't
[7681.30 → 7682.58] listen to music on it
[7682.58 → 7682.90] awesome
[7682.90 → 7685.28] like where this is
[7685.28 → 7685.74] coming from
[7685.74 → 7686.98] is for a while there
[7686.98 → 7687.92] my phone was lasting
[7687.92 → 7689.14] for like two hours
[7689.14 → 7692.18] I permanently had to
[7692.18 → 7692.70] walk around with
[7692.70 → 7693.34] battery packs
[7693.34 → 7694.04] I was going through
[7694.04 → 7695.14] multiple battery packs
[7695.14 → 7696.08] like a day
[7696.08 → 7697.88] which was nuts
[7697.88 → 7699.14] my brother had
[7699.14 → 7700.46] similar battery problems
[7700.46 → 7701.60] not to quite the same
[7701.60 → 7702.46] degree but very similar
[7702.46 → 7703.34] battery problems
[7703.34 → 7704.56] he also has an S3
[7704.56 → 7705.98] and at right around
[7705.98 → 7706.80] the same time
[7706.80 → 7708.70] they both just
[7708.70 → 7709.44] healed themselves
[7709.44 → 7709.98] so
[7709.98 → 7710.98] it's funny because
[7710.98 → 7711.66] Samsung released
[7711.66 → 7712.12] an update
[7712.12 → 7712.96] but wasn't it an update
[7712.96 → 7713.82] for like their weird
[7713.82 → 7715.06] S whatever software
[7715.06 → 7716.32] some random piece
[7716.32 → 7716.66] of software
[7716.66 → 7717.06] and they haven't
[7717.06 → 7717.72] released a new
[7717.72 → 7718.42] update for it
[7718.42 → 7719.36] so
[7719.36 → 7721.04] I don't even know
[7721.04 → 7721.56] if that's it
[7721.56 → 7722.32] I have no idea
[7722.32 → 7722.78] what happened
[7722.78 → 7723.44] but my phone
[7723.44 → 7724.26] became almost
[7724.26 → 7725.30] impossible to use
[7725.30 → 7726.20] for about a week
[7726.20 → 7726.64] or two
[7726.64 → 7728.22] and like my battery
[7728.22 → 7729.10] app that I have
[7729.10 → 7729.52] monitoring
[7729.52 → 7730.22] and I still have
[7730.22 → 7730.68] it monitoring
[7730.68 → 7731.22] and that battery
[7731.22 → 7732.08] app has not been
[7732.08 → 7732.42] updated
[7732.42 → 7733.20] so it's not that
[7733.20 → 7735.00] would report
[7735.00 → 7735.56] it would be like
[7735.56 → 7736.18] yeah you have
[7736.18 → 7736.60] what was that
[7736.60 → 7737.34] screenshot I had
[7737.34 → 7738.60] yeah it was like
[7738.60 → 7739.70] 25% battery
[7739.70 → 7740.58] five minutes left
[7740.58 → 7741.42] five minutes left
[7741.42 → 7741.84] it's like
[7741.84 → 7742.68] okay
[7742.68 → 7743.80] oh god
[7743.80 → 7744.92] that's not good
[7744.92 → 7746.50] speaking of the S4
[7746.50 → 7747.18] though we're going to be
[7747.18 → 7748.00] hands on with it
[7748.00 → 7748.58] next Wednesday
[7748.58 → 7749.62] awesome
[7749.62 → 7750.40] that'll be really cool
[7750.40 → 7751.90] so weeks after
[7751.90 → 7752.52] everyone else
[7752.52 → 7753.00] but we should
[7753.00 → 7754.16] do a test
[7754.16 → 7754.50] where I have to
[7754.50 → 7755.24] hold both my hands
[7755.24 → 7755.60] and try and figure
[7755.60 → 7756.18] out which ones which
[7756.18 → 7757.20] oh
[7757.20 → 7758.56] I don't know if
[7758.56 → 7759.34] Samsung wants us
[7759.34 → 7760.02] to do that test
[7760.02 → 7764.50] I wonder if I could
[7764.50 → 7765.24] did any buttons
[7765.24 → 7765.78] actually change
[7765.78 → 7766.16] position
[7766.16 → 7768.28] I know the
[7768.28 → 7769.56] middle button thing
[7769.56 → 7770.74] is slightly different
[7770.74 → 7771.60] like I actually
[7771.60 → 7772.30] don't remember
[7772.30 → 7773.86] every so slightly
[7773.86 → 7774.06] different
[7774.06 → 7774.60] Google bought
[7774.60 → 7774.90] WhatsApp
[7774.90 → 7775.88] or is buying
[7775.88 → 7776.10] WhatsApp
[7776.10 → 7776.36] yeah
[7776.36 → 7777.00] they're in
[7777.00 → 7777.74] negotiation to
[7777.74 → 7778.18] buy WhatsApp
[7778.18 → 7779.06] for a billion
[7779.06 → 7779.72] dollars
[7779.72 → 7780.78] all the money
[7780.78 → 7782.16] but for
[7782.16 → 7783.54] potential integration
[7783.54 → 7784.28] with their own
[7784.28 → 7784.76] services
[7784.76 → 7785.70] obviously there's
[7785.70 → 7786.86] a huge number
[7786.86 → 7787.42] of people that
[7787.42 → 7788.18] use WhatsApp
[7788.18 → 7791.06] I mean
[7791.06 → 7792.44] obviously they
[7792.44 → 7793.10] don't expect to
[7793.10 → 7793.56] get the money
[7793.56 → 7794.30] back in terms
[7794.30 → 7794.76] of actual
[7794.76 → 7795.22] revenue
[7795.22 → 7795.96] because WhatsApp
[7795.96 → 7796.46] only even
[7796.46 → 7797.16] costs money
[7797.16 → 7797.70] on iOS
[7797.70 → 7799.00] and so even
[7799.00 → 7799.72] if like
[7799.72 → 7801.34] one-sixth
[7801.34 → 7801.82] of the people
[7801.82 → 7802.52] on earth
[7802.52 → 7803.18] bought it
[7803.18 → 7803.74] for their
[7803.74 → 7804.30] iPhones
[7804.30 → 7806.40] they wouldn't
[7806.40 → 7807.08] even get back
[7807.08 → 7808.08] in terms of
[7808.08 → 7808.82] sheer revenue
[7808.82 → 7809.32] the amount
[7809.32 → 7809.80] that they spent
[7809.80 → 7810.46] on the acquisition
[7810.46 → 7810.92] but
[7810.92 → 7813.46] I mean
[7813.46 → 7813.96] waters
[7813.96 → 7814.32] I'm sure
[7814.32 → 7815.02] they plan to
[7815.02 → 7815.24] I mean
[7815.24 → 7816.06] here's the thing
[7816.06 → 7816.72] would you want
[7816.72 → 7817.26] Google reading
[7817.26 → 7818.14] your SMS messages
[7818.14 → 7819.68] your telco
[7819.68 → 7820.40] already can
[7820.40 → 7821.18] so
[7821.18 → 7822.66] there's that
[7822.66 → 7823.14] it's not like
[7823.14 → 7823.68] it's like
[7823.68 → 7824.38] encrypted
[7824.38 → 7825.28] it's not technically
[7825.28 → 7825.90] SMS though
[7825.90 → 7827.06] isn't it
[7827.06 → 7828.72] come on though
[7828.72 → 7829.40] same idea
[7829.40 → 7829.88] but like
[7829.88 → 7830.40] okay yeah
[7830.40 → 7831.18] basically it is
[7831.18 → 7832.12] I was just
[7832.12 → 7833.14] clarifying
[7833.14 → 7834.56] because it's over
[7834.56 → 7835.08] whatever
[7835.08 → 7836.36] no
[7836.36 → 7837.12] but
[7837.12 → 7838.50] this ties into
[7838.50 → 7838.94] the stance
[7838.94 → 7839.34] that Google
[7839.34 → 7839.82] was taking
[7839.82 → 7840.72] against CISA
[7840.72 → 7841.66] where
[7841.66 → 7842.74] I'd rather
[7842.74 → 7843.38] they read it
[7843.38 → 7843.94] than some other
[7843.94 → 7844.24] people
[7844.24 → 7844.94] because I would
[7844.94 → 7845.68] rather Google
[7845.68 → 7846.98] tuned advertisements
[7846.98 → 7847.52] to me
[7847.52 → 7848.14] than someone
[7848.14 → 7849.06] actually
[7849.06 → 7850.68] actually stalked me
[7850.68 → 7851.60] right
[7851.60 → 7852.52] so while
[7852.52 → 7853.00] no
[7853.00 → 7853.82] I do not want
[7853.82 → 7854.30] Google reading
[7854.30 → 7855.00] my text messages
[7855.00 → 7855.70] no I do not
[7855.70 → 7856.34] want them reading
[7856.34 → 7856.80] my emails
[7856.80 → 7858.24] no I do not
[7858.24 → 7858.98] want them reading
[7858.98 → 7859.76] anything else
[7859.76 → 7861.20] at this point in time
[7861.20 → 7862.10] no matter how
[7862.10 → 7863.32] evil Google can be
[7863.32 → 7864.26] they're almost
[7864.26 → 7864.78] looking like
[7864.78 → 7865.24] the lesser
[7865.24 → 7866.24] of multiple evils
[7866.24 → 7867.98] because
[7867.98 → 7868.84] like
[7868.84 → 7869.96] it's just getting
[7869.96 → 7870.58] kind of brutal
[7870.58 → 7871.86] everyone's reading
[7871.86 → 7872.20] your email
[7872.20 → 7873.10] Microsoft isn't
[7873.10 → 7873.74] but then Microsoft
[7873.74 → 7874.74] filters everything
[7874.74 → 7875.52] through servers
[7875.52 → 7876.08] in the states
[7876.08 → 7877.90] right
[7877.90 → 7878.62] so it's like
[7878.62 → 7879.08] oh
[7879.08 → 7880.98] you're not
[7880.98 → 7881.66] but someone
[7881.66 → 7882.80] who's telling you
[7882.80 → 7883.92] to is
[7883.92 → 7884.58] right
[7884.58 → 7886.90] I don't know
[7886.90 → 7888.68] privacy is becoming
[7888.68 → 7889.76] such a weird
[7889.76 → 7890.78] area
[7890.78 → 7892.78] as like
[7892.78 → 7893.54] every country
[7893.54 → 7894.20] ever just
[7894.20 → 7895.74] goes after
[7895.74 → 7896.20] everyone
[7896.20 → 7896.88] including their own
[7896.88 → 7897.28] citizens
[7897.28 → 7898.22] you know what's
[7898.22 → 7898.70] kind of weird
[7898.70 → 7899.36] about Twitch
[7899.36 → 7902.06] they run ads
[7902.06 → 7902.94] on your content
[7902.94 → 7904.40] before you're
[7904.40 → 7905.06] actually
[7905.06 → 7908.36] like a
[7908.36 → 7908.74] partner
[7908.74 → 7909.84] like I don't
[7909.84 → 7910.34] think YouTube
[7910.34 → 7911.40] runs ads on
[7911.40 → 7912.12] videos where
[7912.12 → 7912.46] you're not
[7912.46 → 7913.04] getting a cut
[7913.04 → 7913.58] of it do they
[7913.58 → 7914.20] don't think so
[7914.20 → 7915.10] speaking of
[7915.10 → 7915.80] being a Twitch
[7915.80 → 7916.42] partner we
[7916.42 → 7917.36] are launching
[7917.36 → 7917.76] our Twitch
[7917.76 → 7918.18] partnership
[7918.18 → 7918.72] very soon
[7918.72 → 7919.08] actually I
[7919.08 → 7919.32] heard from
[7919.32 → 7919.70] them today
[7919.70 → 7921.48] so yeah
[7921.48 → 7922.62] so the ads
[7922.62 → 7923.56] will support
[7923.56 → 7924.80] will support
[7924.80 → 7926.02] Linus Tech Tips
[7926.02 → 7926.60] at some point
[7926.60 → 7928.36] so there you go
[7928.36 → 7932.20] yeah
[7932.20 → 7934.08] but I don't know
[7934.08 → 7934.60] I just I loaded
[7934.60 → 7935.16] up the Twitch
[7935.16 → 7936.32] stream and I
[7936.32 → 7936.84] saw an ad
[7936.84 → 7937.32] and I was like
[7937.32 → 7938.82] oh that's cool
[7938.82 → 7939.24] I mean that's
[7939.24 → 7939.78] good but it
[7939.78 → 7940.52] says right under
[7940.52 → 7941.20] it this ad
[7941.20 → 7941.92] supports Linus
[7941.92 → 7942.62] Tech level up
[7942.62 → 7942.90] your Twitch
[7942.90 → 7943.46] experience
[7943.46 → 7944.28] but it doesn't
[7944.28 → 7944.52] yet
[7944.52 → 7945.20] so did they
[7945.20 → 7946.04] did it say
[7946.04 → 7946.74] that before
[7946.74 → 7947.60] because it's
[7947.60 → 7948.14] possible they've
[7948.14 → 7948.68] turned us on
[7948.68 → 7949.28] now like I
[7949.28 → 7949.62] don't know
[7949.62 → 7950.12] like we're
[7950.12 → 7951.30] actually like
[7951.30 → 7952.14] I have no
[7952.14 → 7952.62] idea
[7952.62 → 7953.90] um
[7953.90 → 7954.66] Twitch chat
[7954.66 → 7955.22] do you know
[7955.22 → 7955.78] did it say
[7955.78 → 7956.38] that before
[7956.38 → 7956.66] yeah
[7956.66 → 7957.40] say this ad
[7957.40 → 7958.22] directly sponsors
[7958.22 → 7959.60] Linus Tech
[7959.60 → 7962.02] people are still
[7962.02 → 7962.72] posting your
[7962.72 → 7963.90] Craigslist ad
[7963.90 → 7965.18] god
[7965.18 → 7969.08] oh my goodness
[7969.08 → 7971.74] I should probably
[7971.74 → 7972.38] edit that
[7972.38 → 7976.46] honestly though
[7976.46 → 7976.94] if I sell my
[7976.94 → 7977.54] bike out of this
[7977.54 → 7977.94] then that'll be
[7977.94 → 7978.18] good
[7978.18 → 7979.74] that'll be
[7979.74 → 7980.24] hilarious

[8013.58 → 8014.36] by the way
[8014.36 → 8016.10] um
[8016.10 → 8022.12] okay we should
[8022.12 → 8023.42] set an actual
[8023.42 → 8023.86] date
[8023.86 → 8026.22] to actually do
[8026.22 → 8027.32] our Super Mario
[8027.32 → 8027.94] World
[8027.94 → 8028.72] stream
[8028.72 → 8030.10] we've been
[8030.10 → 8030.78] promising that
[8030.78 → 8031.76] for months
[8031.76 → 8033.64] do you want
[8033.64 → 8033.90] to do it
[8033.90 → 8034.46] during the week
[8034.46 → 8034.82] or on a
[8034.82 → 8035.12] weekend
[8035.12 → 8036.74] um
[8036.74 → 8037.52] whatever let's
[8037.52 → 8037.86] do it
[8037.86 → 8038.14] do you want
[8038.14 → 8038.34] to do it
[8038.34 → 8038.86] right now
[8038.86 → 8039.32] do you want
[8039.32 → 8039.68] to figure it
[8039.68 → 8040.30] out right now
[8040.30 → 8041.56] no oh like
[8041.56 → 8042.12] figure out the
[8042.12 → 8042.80] actual time
[8042.80 → 8044.38] yeah um
[8044.38 → 8045.08] I did I
[8045.08 → 8045.54] didn't mean
[8045.54 → 8046.16] play the whole
[8046.16 → 8046.70] thing now
[8046.70 → 8047.98] we have to
[8047.98 → 8049.08] sleep at some
[8049.08 → 8049.60] point yeah
[8049.60 → 8050.44] I was going to say
[8050.44 → 8051.08] I don't really
[8051.08 → 8051.88] know about that
[8051.88 → 8053.62] but uh
[8053.62 → 8055.34] what do you
[8055.34 → 8055.88] think weekday
[8055.88 → 8056.36] or weekend
[8056.36 → 8057.04] probably we're
[8057.04 → 8057.60] not going to get
[8057.60 → 8058.38] get done on a
[8058.38 → 8059.06] weekday no
[8059.06 → 8059.90] quite realistically
[8059.90 → 8060.82] we're gonna work
[8060.82 → 8061.70] till like eight
[8061.70 → 8062.20] anyway
[8062.20 → 8062.94] yeah
[8062.94 → 8063.64] and then I'll
[8063.64 → 8064.44] continue and so
[8064.44 → 8065.56] will you realistically
[8065.56 → 8066.26] so no
[8066.26 → 8067.10] what about like a
[8067.10 → 8068.04] Saturday during a
[8068.04 → 8069.74] day am I if my
[8069.74 → 8070.24] wife can let me
[8070.24 → 8070.72] get away with that
[8070.72 → 8071.00] though
[8071.00 → 8073.80] do you think the
[8073.80 → 8074.46] rest of Linus
[8074.46 → 8075.14] media group would
[8075.14 → 8076.00] just freak if you
[8076.00 → 8076.68] and I spent an
[8076.68 → 8077.68] entire work day
[8077.68 → 8078.78] playing Super Mario
[8078.78 → 8079.14] World
[8079.14 → 8079.98] yeah
[8079.98 → 8082.12] I don't know how
[8082.12 → 8082.86] okay that would
[8082.86 → 8083.64] be
[8083.64 → 8084.26] um
[8084.26 → 8086.16] can
[8086.16 → 8086.82] can
[8086.82 → 8088.60] little baby man
[8088.60 → 8089.88] be offloaded to
[8089.88 → 8090.88] grandparents
[8090.88 → 8092.52] that's actually
[8092.52 → 8093.26] not a bad idea
[8093.26 → 8094.32] but if that was
[8094.32 → 8095.14] to happen
[8095.14 → 8095.78] maybe
[8095.78 → 8095.82] maybe
[8095.82 → 8096.84] Mrs.
[8096.92 → 8097.40] wife can
[8097.40 → 8098.76] take a day
[8098.76 → 8101.36] go hang out
[8101.36 → 8101.92] with some friends
[8101.92 → 8102.60] or do something

[8107.34 → 8108.30] so she can do
[8108.30 → 8108.52] that
[8108.52 → 8109.08] not this weekend
[8109.08 → 8109.74] well no I have to
[8109.74 → 8110.70] be there smart guy
[8110.70 → 8111.42] no she can
[8111.42 → 8112.54] she can help prep
[8112.54 → 8112.88] for that
[8112.88 → 8113.68] I meant like
[8113.68 → 8115.52] yeah but then
[8115.52 → 8116.80] oh, and then you're
[8116.80 → 8117.62] saying I drop the
[8117.62 → 8118.24] baby with the
[8118.24 → 8118.68] grandparents
[8118.68 → 8119.96] and then we do
[8119.96 → 8120.24] our super
[8120.24 → 8120.96] so she takes a
[8120.96 → 8122.02] day baby goes
[8122.02 → 8122.48] off hangs out
[8122.48 → 8122.62] with the
[8122.62 → 8123.00] grandparents
[8123.00 → 8123.42] how long do you
[8123.42 → 8123.84] think it'll take
[8123.84 → 8124.48] us to beat it
[8124.48 → 8125.84] I don't know
[8125.84 → 8127.16] it's been so long
[8127.16 → 8128.90] oh come on
[8128.90 → 8131.84] come on
[8131.84 → 8132.86] wow
[8132.86 → 8133.78] wow
[8133.78 → 8135.10] just wow
[8135.10 → 8135.84] it's the after
[8135.84 → 8136.78] party those jokes

[8137.40 → 8137.70] out
[8137.70 → 8138.40] yeah
[8138.40 → 8139.08] they have to come
[8139.08 → 8139.36] out
[8139.36 → 8141.28] anyway
[8141.28 → 8142.66] how long do you
[8142.66 → 8143.08] think it would
[8143.08 → 8143.70] take us to
[8143.70 → 8144.78] complete the game
[8144.78 → 8146.02] um
[8146.02 → 8147.08] because I can burn
[8147.08 → 8148.02] through probably
[8148.02 → 8150.28] everything up to
[8150.28 → 8151.56] chocolate island
[8151.56 → 8152.02] like
[8152.02 → 8153.86] first try
[8153.86 → 8154.76] maybe second try
[8154.76 → 8155.96] like I can get
[8155.96 → 8156.56] through most of
[8156.56 → 8157.12] that stuff pretty
[8157.12 → 8157.44] quick
[8157.44 → 8158.46] some of the stuff
[8158.46 → 8159.16] is kind of tricky
[8159.16 → 8159.62] I don't forget
[8159.62 → 8160.40] I don't remember
[8160.40 → 8161.14] if it's the cheese
[8161.14 → 8161.72] bridge or one of
[8161.72 → 8162.18] the other ones
[8162.18 → 8162.62] where it's like
[8162.62 → 8163.30] I can never
[8163.30 → 8163.94] remember where
[8163.94 → 8164.90] that stupid
[8164.90 → 8165.66] secret is
[8165.66 → 8166.36] to get down
[8166.36 → 8166.86] to the star
[8166.86 → 8167.42] road from the
[8167.42 → 8167.78] bridge
[8167.78 → 8169.22] um
[8169.22 → 8169.98] are we doing
[8169.98 → 8170.24] like
[8170.24 → 8171.60] what
[8171.60 → 8172.12] to what
[8172.12 → 8172.78] point are we
[8172.78 → 8173.02] getting
[8173.02 → 8174.00] well we have
[8174.00 → 8174.48] to go 96
[8174.48 → 8175.22] oh okay
[8175.22 → 8175.48] yeah
[8175.48 → 8175.98] oh yeah
[8175.98 → 8176.80] so, and I mean
[8176.80 → 8177.44] the special
[8177.44 → 8178.04] levels are
[8178.04 → 8178.84] ridiculous
[8178.84 → 8179.82] I don't remember
[8179.82 → 8180.32] where everything
[8180.32 → 8180.58] is
[8180.58 → 8181.16] it's half
[8181.16 → 8181.66] luck
[8181.66 → 8182.60] so the special
[8182.60 → 8183.16] levels are the
[8183.16 → 8183.60] ones at the
[8183.60 → 8184.02] centre of the
[8184.02 → 8184.52] star road
[8184.52 → 8185.86] no like I know
[8185.86 → 8186.70] but like I mean
[8186.70 → 8187.48] like within levels
[8187.48 → 8187.88] and stuff
[8187.88 → 8188.64] like it's been
[8188.64 → 8189.26] a really long
[8189.26 → 8189.88] I can remind
[8189.88 → 8190.22] you though
[8190.22 → 8192.52] I did it a
[8192.52 → 8193.24] year or two
[8193.24 → 8193.52] ago
[8193.52 → 8194.58] oh I haven't
[8194.58 → 8195.12] done it since
[8195.12 → 8195.68] I was a kid
[8195.68 → 8196.62] yeah no I
[8196.62 → 8197.66] I've actually done
[8197.66 → 8198.42] it not that
[8198.42 → 8198.96] long ago
[8198.96 → 8200.12] it's actually
[8200.12 → 8200.72] been like
[8200.72 → 8201.96] it's been a
[8201.96 → 8202.74] really long time
[8202.74 → 8203.08] since I've
[8203.08 → 8203.50] played a Mario
[8203.50 → 8204.06] game I love
[8204.06 → 8204.50] playing old
[8204.50 → 8204.92] school games
[8204.92 → 8205.32] but I've been
[8205.32 → 8205.92] trying to go
[8205.92 → 8206.42] back and play
[8206.42 → 8206.96] old school games
[8206.96 → 8207.56] that I haven't
[8207.56 → 8208.14] played yet
[8208.14 → 8209.38] right so stuff
[8209.38 → 8210.12] like Mario is
[8210.12 → 8210.72] not coming up
[8210.72 → 8211.18] I haven't played
[8211.18 → 8211.80] Mario since I was
[8211.80 → 8212.08] a kid
[8212.08 → 8213.06] right okay
[8213.06 → 8213.54] so I'm probably
[8213.54 → 8214.04] going to suck
[8214.04 → 8214.46] which will be
[8214.46 → 8215.14] kind of entertaining
[8215.14 → 8215.54] anyway
[8215.54 → 8216.56] you'll probably be
[8216.56 → 8217.34] okay you know
[8217.34 → 8218.10] what I found is
[8218.10 → 8218.98] actually having
[8218.98 → 8220.00] gone so many
[8220.00 → 8220.62] years without
[8220.62 → 8221.26] playing a Mario
[8221.26 → 8222.22] game I actually
[8222.22 → 8223.12] still had pretty
[8223.12 → 8223.68] much all my
[8223.68 → 8223.98] skills
[8223.98 → 8225.60] like it and
[8225.60 → 8226.30] it came back
[8226.30 → 8227.70] like really
[8227.70 → 8228.90] fast you know
[8228.90 → 8229.18] what might
[8229.18 → 8229.88] actually be more
[8229.88 → 8231.48] fun like original
[8231.48 → 8232.10] Super Mario
[8232.10 → 8233.58] Brothers because
[8233.58 → 8234.62] that would be
[8234.62 → 8235.64] infuriating
[8235.64 → 8237.02] especially so
[8237.02 → 8238.52] difficult yeah it
[8238.52 → 8239.28] gets really tough
[8239.28 → 8240.02] towards the end
[8240.02 → 8241.06] although at least
[8241.06 → 8242.02] Bowser's always
[8242.02 → 8243.90] like what would
[8243.90 → 8245.28] it is so waited
[8245.28 → 8246.14] till he jumps so
[8246.14 → 8247.14] so jump get him
[8247.14 → 8247.96] to get him to
[8247.96 → 8248.96] jump over the
[8248.96 → 8249.82] fireball go under
[8249.82 → 8250.42] him and then kill
[8250.42 → 8250.96] him every time
[8250.96 → 8252.98] my favourite thing
[8252.98 → 8254.00] is this picture
[8254.00 → 8255.00] that is like this
[8255.00 → 8255.98] is the exact key
[8255.98 → 8256.66] combination you
[8256.66 → 8257.34] need to beat the
[8257.34 → 8258.06] entire game
[8258.06 → 8260.44] which one is it
[8260.44 → 8261.04] there 's's a
[8261.04 → 8261.74] picture online
[8261.74 → 8262.66] that's like hold
[8262.66 → 8263.40] arrow press this
[8263.40 → 8263.92] button press this
[8263.92 → 8264.44] button press this
[8264.44 → 8264.98] button hold arrow
[8264.98 → 8266.04] press this like and
[8266.04 → 8266.56] it goes through the
[8266.56 → 8267.14] entire thing it's
[8267.14 → 8268.00] about like yay
[8268.00 → 8269.00] long with like
[8269.00 → 8270.10] tiny little icons
[8270.10 → 8270.70] but it's like if
[8270.70 → 8271.40] you type in this
[8271.40 → 8272.82] key combination and
[8272.82 → 8273.30] wait for load
[8273.30 → 8274.08] screens in between
[8274.08 → 8275.10] you will beat the
[8275.10 → 8275.68] entire game
[8275.68 → 8278.44] really I didn't
[8278.44 → 8278.84] even know that
[8278.84 → 8279.56] because those crazy
[8279.56 → 8280.74] speed runners they
[8280.74 → 8281.64] like have it down
[8281.64 → 8282.52] to like a rhythm
[8282.52 → 8283.66] right
[8283.66 → 8284.96] nuts
[8284.96 → 8286.18] yeah well we
[8286.18 → 8286.68] won't be doing
[8286.68 → 8287.92] any kind of uh
[8287.92 → 8289.32] any kind of uh
[8289.32 → 8290.68] speed runs so
[8290.68 → 8292.42] there you go
[8292.42 → 8297.14] someone in twitch
[8297.14 → 8297.84] chat just says
[8297.84 → 8298.46] Linus what's your
[8298.46 → 8299.00] opinion on the
[8299.00 → 8299.94] Nintendo 64
[8299.94 → 8301.34] you know what I
[8301.34 → 8302.12] never had one
[8302.12 → 8303.12] really although
[8303.12 → 8304.42] um although
[8304.42 → 8306.06] Mario Kart 64
[8306.06 → 8306.64] is one of my
[8306.64 → 8307.32] favourite all-time
[8307.32 → 8308.08] games it's
[8308.08 → 8308.68] outstanding
[8308.68 → 8309.50] I'm not very good
[8309.50 → 8309.90] at it but I
[8309.90 → 8310.40] love that game
[8310.40 → 8311.42] actually spent like
[8311.42 → 8312.26] five bucks to get
[8312.26 → 8312.68] it in the Wii
[8312.68 → 8313.10] marketplace
[8313.10 → 8314.06] nice
[8314.06 → 8315.52] haven't you haven't
[8315.52 → 8316.14] we played it
[8316.14 → 8317.16] yeah we did one
[8317.16 → 8318.00] day one time
[8318.00 → 8318.94] we should oh we
[8318.94 → 8319.36] should play
[8319.36 → 8320.22] I'm terrible
[8320.22 → 8320.84] my wife's not
[8320.84 → 8322.98] bad and besides I
[8322.98 → 8323.50] don't mind winning
[8323.50 → 8324.22] all the time so
[8324.22 → 8325.18] it's fine I don't
[8325.18 → 8325.86] care if you suck
[8325.86 → 8328.92] if you want we
[8328.92 → 8329.74] can play some FPS
[8329.74 → 8330.22] I was just gonna
[8330.22 → 8330.92] say let's go play
[8330.92 → 8331.94] battlefield again or
[8331.94 → 8332.90] something or like
[8332.90 → 8333.56] yeah star cut
[8333.56 → 8334.36] people are upset I
[8334.36 → 8335.44] never had a n64
[8335.44 → 8336.32] it's okay because my
[8336.32 → 8337.56] best friend had a n64
[8337.56 → 8338.94] and I'd always go
[8338.94 → 8339.52] over to his house
[8339.52 → 8340.20] that's always yeah
[8340.20 → 8340.98] with his babysitter
[8340.98 → 8342.26] after school, so I
[8342.26 → 8343.88] played a lot of n64
[8343.88 → 8344.84] played a ton of
[8344.84 → 8346.32] perfect dark played a
[8346.32 → 8348.26] ton of gold my played
[8348.26 → 8349.80] a ton of Mario Kart
[8349.80 → 8351.52] um played a ton of
[8351.52 → 8352.46] that oh what was that
[8352.46 → 8353.48] terrible I think it was
[8353.48 → 8355.80] NHL 2007 where it was
[8355.80 → 8356.98] like everything was
[8356.98 → 8358.22] like multicoloured and
[8358.22 → 8359.38] it was like that
[8359.38 → 8360.82] down at ice level view
[8360.82 → 8361.78] and it was just an
[8361.78 → 8362.92] absolute piece of crap
[8362.92 → 8363.84] played a lot of that
[8363.84 → 8365.28] because my friend
[8365.28 → 8365.98] really liked playing
[8365.98 → 8366.72] hockey games
[8366.72 → 8368.84] laptop gun perfect dark
[8368.84 → 8369.70] the coolest thing ever
[8369.70 → 8371.46] anyway I didn't have a
[8371.46 → 8372.64] original Nintendo but
[8372.64 → 8373.46] one of my buddies did
[8373.46 → 8374.58] and one of my buddies
[8374.58 → 8377.98] had and they probably
[8377.98 → 8378.72] didn't even hear that
[8378.72 → 8379.80] and one of my buddies
[8379.80 → 8381.18] had like satellite or
[8381.18 → 8381.78] whatever at the time
[8381.78 → 8382.66] that I didn't have so
[8382.66 → 8383.74] he could watch Pokémon
[8383.74 → 8385.04] so I go to his house
[8385.04 → 8386.06] all the time to play
[8386.06 → 8387.32] Nintendo and watch
[8387.32 → 8389.40] Pokémon nice it was
[8389.40 → 8390.52] awesome he was okay I
[8390.52 → 8391.66] guess but Nintendo and
[8391.66 → 8393.42] Pokémon that's what's up
[8393.42 → 8395.30] someone just suggested
[8395.30 → 8396.98] that we play slender a
[8396.98 → 8397.98] first person horror game
[8397.98 → 8399.00] you know I think the
[8399.00 → 8400.46] whole horror game
[8400.46 → 8401.64] streaming on YouTube
[8401.64 → 8403.22] thing has been done to
[8403.22 → 8404.74] death and not interested
[8404.74 → 8406.44] at all because it's so
[8406.44 → 8408.68] dumb and slender is not
[8408.68 → 8411.80] scary like what the heck
[8411.80 → 8413.08] guys you know what we
[8413.08 → 8414.18] could we should totally
[8414.18 → 8415.26] do like a PewDiePie
[8415.26 → 8415.70] parody
[8415.70 → 8423.46] you didn't fall off your
[8423.46 → 8424.22] chair dude if you're
[8424.22 → 8425.30] watching I'm sorry but
[8425.30 → 8426.26] that's basically what you
[8426.26 → 8427.00] look like you didn't fall
[8427.00 → 8427.80] off your chair I know
[8427.80 → 8428.62] right it's not good enough
[8428.62 → 8429.76] I have a laptop that I
[8429.76 → 8430.84] actually don't want to
[8430.84 → 8432.04] destroy in my lap, so I
[8432.04 → 8432.80] don't want to fall off
[8432.80 → 8434.68] you know I'm not going to
[8434.68 → 8436.18] do that, but that guy is
[8436.18 → 8438.76] balling like ridiculous
[8438.76 → 8440.48] like yeah headphone users
[8440.48 → 8441.90] are unhappy at the moment
[8441.90 → 8445.84] um but like slender is not
[8445.84 → 8448.24] scary play it or watch a
[8448.24 → 8451.10] video what like no that
[8451.10 → 8452.96] game is not scary at all
[8452.96 → 8456.22] oh I'm sorry you guys
[8456.22 → 8459.22] everyone's unhappy oh I
[8459.22 → 8459.72] thought we turned
[8459.72 → 8462.34] attenuation on yeah it's
[8462.34 → 8463.10] on I guess it didn't
[8463.10 → 8465.62] work I think that might
[8465.62 → 8466.32] have been a little bit
[8466.32 → 8467.30] well like attenuation
[8467.30 → 8468.02] will keep it from
[8468.02 → 8468.80] peaking, but it's still
[8468.80 → 8470.28] ridiculously loud yeah I
[8470.28 → 8474.14] guess my bad yeah I
[8474.14 → 8476.04] mean honestly PewDiePie's
[8476.04 → 8477.70] thing like where it's
[8477.70 → 8480.32] like why okay PewDiePie's
[8480.32 → 8482.58] freaking out is cheesy
[8482.58 → 8484.14] so cheesy might be true but
[8484.14 → 8485.74] it's cheesy it's not true
[8485.74 → 8487.56] I really don't think it
[8487.56 → 8489.70] is at all oh I don't
[8489.70 → 8491.06] just I'm talking more
[8491.06 → 8491.92] about I don't care about
[8491.92 → 8493.06] whatever PewDiePie okay
[8493.06 → 8495.62] whatever slender that's
[8495.62 → 8496.30] what I'm actually talking
[8496.30 → 8497.66] about slender is not a
[8497.66 → 8499.84] scary game what is a scary
[8499.84 → 8501.48] game to you Linus what is
[8501.48 → 8502.82] your opinion on pubes asks
[8502.82 → 8503.64] one of the viewers in
[8503.64 → 8507.86] twitch chat I think they're
[8507.86 → 8509.00] curly these are technically
[8509.00 → 8510.38] they're kind of curly or
[8510.38 → 8513.52] kinky or yeah no I
[8513.52 → 8515.20] actually mean like kinked
[8515.20 → 8516.32] yeah because the female
[8516.32 → 8517.42] version is kinked and then
[8517.42 → 8518.46] the male version is curly
[8518.46 → 8519.16] it's for a friction
[8519.16 → 8521.82] reduction I'm actually not
[8521.82 → 8524.48] even joking I just didn't
[8524.48 → 8525.24] think we were going to get
[8525.24 → 8530.48] into this wow um I don't
[8530.48 → 8531.52] know I haven't really
[8531.52 → 8532.28] played any that have
[8532.28 → 8533.26] legitimately scared me
[8533.26 → 8534.90] because they're mostly
[8534.90 → 8537.50] fairly obvious, but there's
[8537.50 → 8538.66] some I'm trying to think
[8538.66 → 8540.38] of the name fear is pretty
[8540.38 → 8541.90] good the little girl when
[8541.90 → 8542.74] you come down the ladder
[8542.74 → 8543.50] and the turn she's right
[8543.50 → 8545.24] like that's that's actually
[8545.24 → 8547.40] like okay yeah that's cool
[8547.40 → 8550.12] slender's not no um the
[8550.12 → 8551.30] thing that made fear scary
[8551.30 → 8553.72] was that you were never
[8553.72 → 8554.74] quite because you know okay
[8554.74 → 8555.76] you know how some scary
[8555.76 → 8557.98] games will have like scary
[8557.98 → 8560.04] cut scenes, but it's just a
[8560.04 → 8561.14] cut scheme you're always in
[8561.14 → 8562.32] the game with nothing can
[8562.32 → 8563.98] hurt you in a cut scene in
[8563.98 → 8565.12] fear some of the freaking
[8565.12 → 8567.14] cut scenes can kill you yeah
[8567.14 → 8567.90] and it's not even like
[8567.90 → 8569.16] quick time event like press the
[8569.16 → 8570.62] button to not die it's like
[8570.62 → 8573.22] figure out what to do now
[8573.22 → 8575.06] while everything is just
[8575.06 → 8577.20] messed up yeah to not die
[8577.20 → 8578.42] see like that was still
[8578.42 → 8580.28] might die, but it might be
[8580.28 → 8581.74] okay, or it might not you
[8581.74 → 8582.60] might actually be dead I
[8582.60 → 8584.80] don't know the uncertainty
[8584.80 → 8585.72] is what made it scary to
[8585.72 → 8588.48] me yeah yeah definitely um
[8588.48 → 8591.34] Alan Wake I might be naming
[8591.34 → 8592.44] the wrong game I know Alan
[8592.44 → 8593.56] Wake is a horror game I
[8593.56 → 8594.32] might be naming the wrong
[8594.32 → 8595.52] game though Dead Space I
[8595.52 → 8599.64] haven't played me either I
[8599.64 → 8601.68] heard Dead Space 1 is what
[8601.68 → 8602.68] you should play if you want
[8602.68 → 8603.62] to play Dead Space not
[8603.62 → 8604.58] necessarily Dead Space 2 or
[8604.58 → 8605.62] 3, but I haven't played any
[8605.62 → 8606.38] of them and these are just
[8606.38 → 8608.06] rumours, so I don't know but
[8608.06 → 8608.78] I've heard they're not very
[8608.78 → 8612.28] good um Power Shock Infinite
[8612.28 → 8614.88] had a scare moment did it
[8614.88 → 8617.06] uh I definitely played the
[8617.06 → 8618.50] entire game and was probably
[8618.50 → 8621.22] as thorough as possible I
[8621.22 → 8622.12] don't remember there being a
[8622.12 → 8622.96] scare moment someone asks how
[8622.96 → 8624.40] my pickle is my pickles
[8624.40 → 8625.24] wonderful thank you
[8625.24 → 8633.64] yeah I don't know I've also
[8633.64 → 8635.08] never understood the point of
[8635.08 → 8636.98] scary games though Michael
[8636.98 → 8638.14] asks if we're not running the
[8638.14 → 8639.66] Intel ad today the snowboard
[8639.66 → 8640.84] promo is over we're going to have
[8640.84 → 8642.08] a new Intel promo running
[8642.08 → 8643.16] sometime in the next little bit
[8643.16 → 8646.14] here, but we haven't we haven't
[8646.14 → 8650.40] got it going, yet this face is
[8650.40 → 8651.84] startling okay that is a
[8651.84 → 8653.62] difference, so this is a great
[8653.62 → 8656.00] tweet Linus you scared the
[8656.00 → 8657.40] living Japanese out of me
[8657.40 → 8659.98] that scream yo the guy's name
[8659.98 → 8663.14] is Striking to scare the
[8663.14 → 8664.66] Japanese out of someone named
[8664.66 → 8667.58] Striking is sort of impressive
[8667.58 → 8669.92] good job very effective
[8669.92 → 8677.80] Mario Kart is a rip-off of the
[8677.80 → 8678.92] older wacky wheels well
[8678.92 → 8680.10] whatever it's a good rip-off
[8680.10 → 8682.34] I don't I don't and Joshi's a
[8682.34 → 8684.60] boss if Mario Kart is a rip-off of
[8684.60 → 8685.92] older wacky wheels then every
[8685.92 → 8687.18] single kart game ever and
[8687.18 → 8689.02] there are tons are all a rip
[8689.02 → 8690.62] rip-off of everything else as
[8690.62 → 8691.60] well yeah you know it's a great
[8691.60 → 8693.70] game rock and roll racing have
[8693.70 → 8695.68] you ever played it no oh it's
[8695.68 → 8698.96] like a top-down racing game for
[8698.96 → 8701.96] SNES with like you know rockets
[8701.96 → 8704.70] and like it's kind of like if
[8704.70 → 8706.38] twisted metal was like a top-down
[8706.38 → 8709.22] racing game it's kind of awesome
[8709.22 → 8710.84] that's pretty cool, and it's like
[8710.84 → 8712.34] it's just super, super fun and it
[8712.34 → 8714.00] has like great music like rock and
[8714.00 → 8715.48] roll music nice that's one thing
[8715.48 → 8717.60] another thing about blood dragon is
[8717.60 → 8721.68] just epic music a while ago on
[8721.68 → 8723.84] some other stream I brought up that I
[8723.84 → 8725.60] had never played the Mega Man series I
[8725.60 → 8726.72] got a little bit of flack for that I
[8726.72 → 8728.84] never had the money to acquire Mega
[8728.84 → 8729.84] Man games I'm sorry
[8729.84 → 8733.70] since then I have gone out I have
[8733.70 → 8736.74] gotten a PS2 Slim a controller memory
[8736.74 → 8738.78] card all that kind of stuff and a disk
[8738.78 → 8741.60] that is like the 10-year anniversary or
[8741.60 → 8743.50] something whatever year anniversary of
[8743.50 → 8745.84] Mega Man, and it has Mega Man 1 through
[8745.84 → 8748.24] 8 and two non-North American releases on
[8748.24 → 8749.60] it and I have started playing through
[8749.60 → 8752.06] them those games are difficult but
[8752.06 → 8754.16] they're so much fun that's one thing
[8754.16 → 8756.86] that's kind of actually gone away is the
[8756.86 → 8759.14] games that are just insanely difficult
[8759.14 → 8760.82] like they pop up every once in a
[8760.82 → 8762.94] while in major releases but insanely
[8762.94 → 8766.16] difficult pretty short but long because
[8766.16 → 8768.86] it's like you're going to die probably a lot
[8768.86 → 8771.70] right like well there was that there was
[8771.70 → 8773.74] that impossible Mario or whatever you
[8773.74 → 8775.42] sent me the other day oh my goodness
[8775.42 → 8777.46] I've actually played that before so it's
[8777.46 → 8780.86] basically a Mario like clone unfair
[8780.86 → 8784.52] Mario where just like you'll make a jump
[8784.52 → 8786.80] but then that section of the floor like
[8786.80 → 8788.34] right there is the only one that
[8788.34 → 8789.92] actually doesn't just disappear when you
[8789.92 → 8792.28] land on it so it's not actually an
[8792.28 → 8794.58] exercise in playing the game it's an
[8794.58 → 8796.94] exercise in memorizing the right spaces
[8796.94 → 8798.32] to go and the only way to make it
[8798.32 → 8801.34] through is sheer trial and error so a
[8801.34 → 8803.36] bunch of people posted Hotline Miami
[8803.36 → 8805.18] Hotline Miami is amazing game it can be
[8805.18 → 8809.16] disturbing so if you're is you're not so
[8809.16 → 8811.36] into disturbing games maybe don't play it
[8811.36 → 8813.64] because certain elements of Hotline Miami
[8813.64 → 8817.18] are kind of messed up I don't want to
[8817.18 → 8819.28] give any spoilers so don't go into it but
[8819.28 → 8821.42] like if you want like really fast if
[8821.42 → 8823.46] you're okay with gore and disturbing
[8823.46 → 8825.44] things because there's lots of it even
[8825.44 → 8827.36] though it's mostly like 8-bit is style
[8827.36 → 8831.14] not actually 8-bit but like old
[8831.14 → 8835.64] school graphics not 8-bit it's its kind
[8835.64 → 8837.80] of just it's a perfect game the
[8837.80 → 8839.88] play style is awesome it's superfast
[8839.88 → 8841.78] pace when you die it's just like bam
[8841.78 → 8844.68] you're back but like incredibly fast
[8844.68 → 8846.98] bam you're back, but it's also insanely
[8846.98 → 8849.24] hard at the same time so you're expected
[8849.24 → 8851.10] to die like a bunch of times
[8851.10 → 8852.84] getting through a single level Oregon
[8852.84 → 8856.66] trail yay or nay Oregon yeah there's
[8856.66 → 8859.66] Oregon trail now too like organs like
[8859.66 → 8862.32] like like like zombie version of Oregon
[8862.32 → 8864.36] trail no way yeah it's on steam it got
[8864.36 → 8866.30] green-lighted Oregon trail, and it's all
[8866.30 → 8868.32] like zombies and stuff did you ever play
[8868.32 → 8871.08] Odell lake no, but I did play Oregon
[8871.08 → 8873.12] trail oh, and I liked it back in the day
[8873.12 → 8874.86] I did at school did you play Yukon trail
[8874.86 → 8879.00] I think so Dino Park Tycoon no oh you
[8879.00 → 8880.08] didn't play do you know Dino Park
[8880.08 → 8881.82] Tycoon I've heard of it yeah oh so
[8881.82 → 8883.98] amazing and Dino Park Tycoon was just
[8883.98 → 8886.62] random like you could do exactly the same
[8886.62 → 8888.12] thing every time at your park and
[8888.12 → 8889.80] sometimes lots of people would come to
[8889.80 → 8890.92] your park and other times they just
[8890.92 → 8893.52] wouldn't like the like it wasn't
[8893.52 → 8895.48] actually like you know if you built a
[8895.48 → 8896.86] good park people would come to if it was
[8896.86 → 8898.60] just like if you were lucky people would
[8898.60 → 8900.10] come to your park, and then you could
[8900.10 → 8902.32] build it up perfect it's just so
[8902.32 → 8905.44] stupid that's so messed up yeah I love to
[8905.44 → 8907.12] Dino Park Tycoon it came on two floppy
[8907.12 → 8909.82] discs nice you know what I really liked
[8909.82 → 8911.74] was that era where the game would come
[8911.74 → 8913.54] out on floppy disks, and it was like
[8913.54 → 8915.10] pretty good then they'd have a like
[8915.10 → 8918.52] exact same thing CD yeah I know right
[8918.52 → 8921.24] like you know what TIE fighter the CD
[8921.24 → 8923.82] version had a great soundtrack sometimes
[8923.82 → 8925.32] they have like increased
[8925.32 → 8927.48] quality or whatever my five floppy disk
[8927.48 → 8930.12] version did not yeah exactly and TIE
[8930.12 → 8931.38] fighter I think had like some
[8931.38 → 8933.06] cinematic and stuff on this yeah
[8933.06 → 8934.80] sometimes it did add things sometimes
[8934.80 → 8936.56] it was just a direct copy I know like
[8936.56 → 8940.32] yeah I'm going to come up I'm going to forget
[8940.32 → 8942.00] proper references, but it was usually
[8942.00 → 8943.86] around where games are about five or six
[8943.86 → 8946.26] floppy disks it was when CD games
[8946.26 → 8948.18] started becoming really popular that was
[8948.18 → 8950.22] really cool someone needs to hardcore
[8950.22 → 8952.68] like ask LucasArts now that they
[8952.68 → 8954.66] apparently don't give two craps anymore
[8954.66 → 8956.28] ask Disney rather since LucasArts
[8956.28 → 8957.96] doesn't exist anymore if they can just
[8957.96 → 8959.94] remake TIE fighter with modern graphics
[8959.94 → 8962.70] honestly there are so many things Disney
[8962.70 → 8964.62] should do with that franchise I know
[8964.62 → 8967.50] remake TIE fighter like no one's gonna
[8967.50 → 8970.08] be upset that you just revamped graphics
[8970.08 → 8972.78] and really released the game like it
[8972.78 → 8975.28] doesn't matter
[8978.18 → 8983.58] okay I have both I have starred I have two
[8983.58 → 8987.24] of the Star Fox games you know I didn't
[8987.24 → 8991.74] enjoy Star Fox or Star Fox 64 didn't do
[8991.74 → 8993.36] anything I was a lot more into Star Fox
[8993.36 → 8998.04] 64 but just didn't do it I liked it but I
[8998.04 → 9000.38] think there were games of similar style
[9000.38 → 9002.60] that were higher calibre in my opinion I
[9002.60 → 9005.06] can see where it's a great game but I
[9005.06 → 9007.34] would rather play other games if I want
[9007.34 → 9009.56] that type of experience, but I did
[9009.56 → 9012.06] really like Star Fox 64
[9012.06 → 9018.02] didn't do it for me just okay well good
[9018.02 → 9020.72] night everyone this is probably our
[9020.72 → 9022.58] the longest live stream ever yeah I'm like
[9022.58 → 9024.20] super, super tired and I need to go to
[9024.20 → 9027.38] sleep yeah something I just said rogue
[9027.38 → 9029.96] squadron greater than Star Fox 64 like
[9029.96 → 9032.06] there were games that I personally would
[9032.06 → 9034.46] have rather played, but I played Star Fox 64
[9034.46 → 9037.88] and it was amazing good night everyone
[9037.88 → 9043.10] I'm going to bed are you going to bed are
[9043.10 → 9045.70] you coming to bed
[9045.70 → 9049.70] that was that too far you turn it off
[9049.70 → 9053.78] I think that's the most forward I've
[9053.78 → 9056.22] ever been
