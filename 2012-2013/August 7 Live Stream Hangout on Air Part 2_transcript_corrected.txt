[0.00 → 11.00] Okay, are we back?
[11.00 → 26.04] Of course there are no viewers now because everyone is gone.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 62.00] Thank you.
[90.00 → 92.00] Thank you.
[92.00 → 94.00] Thank you.
[94.00 → 96.00] Thank you.
[96.00 → 98.00] Thank you.
[98.00 → 100.00] Thank you.
[100.00 → 102.00] Thank you.
[102.00 → 104.00] Thank you.
[104.00 → 106.00] Thank you.
[106.00 → 108.00] Thank you.
[108.00 → 110.00] Thank you.
[110.00 → 112.00] Thank you.
[112.00 → 114.00] Thank you.
[114.00 → 116.00] Thank you.
[116.00 → 118.00] Good to sit.
[118.00 → 120.00] No beverages, no sleep, can you ask?
[120.00 → 122.00] No conditions.
[122.00 → 124.00] You're dirty.
[124.00 → 126.00] You're not covered, no questions.
[126.00 → 128.00] I would feel good.
[128.00 → 130.00] I can take the Jukebox team and don't think you would fall loose.
[130.00 → 134.00] And I think Vegas soon we wouldn't roles except forBB2,
[134.00 → 136.00] And new opportunities.
[136.00 → 165.98] Thank you.
[166.00 → 195.98] Thank you.
[196.00 → 225.98] Thank you.
[226.00 → 228.00] Thank you.
[234.00 → 234.92] Are we back?
[236.30 → 237.44] I have moved.
[238.84 → 240.04] I am live again.
[240.24 → 240.66] Excellent.
[241.04 → 241.40] Okay.
[241.40 → 247.44] So I don't know what caused that exactly, but I am definitely not using Google Hangouts
[247.44 → 248.38] on Air anymore.
[248.38 → 264.78] I am back tweeting it, and that'll probably affect viewership over the next little while
[264.78 → 265.36] here tonight.
[265.36 → 269.26] Let's get my, get everything all set up again.
[269.40 → 271.26] So I'm in my computer room now.
[271.32 → 273.92] You can see I've got a cat lounging up there.
[274.02 → 280.14] I've tried to put on some lights that might make the video quality somewhat acceptable.
[280.14 → 283.78] I don't know what this is.
[285.92 → 288.32] Apparently Firefox is, oh no, Firefox is good.
[288.52 → 288.80] Okay.
[289.20 → 289.76] All right.
[290.10 → 290.74] We're back.
[294.20 → 295.04] Are we back?
[295.18 → 295.86] I think we're back.
[295.86 → 300.22] Let me just sort of adjust the thing, because I'm sitting in a chair that's a different
[300.22 → 300.76] height here.
[302.00 → 305.68] And I, like I don't, okay, guys, tell me something really quick here.
[305.68 → 315.66] Is there, is there any, like is the, is the original live stream, live stream part one,
[315.74 → 318.98] I guess I'll have to call it now, is that one still showing up anywhere?
[320.22 → 323.86] Or is the default one, when you look at the channel, live stream part two?
[326.08 → 328.56] Let's check the video manager here.
[328.96 → 329.50] That over.
[331.06 → 333.14] Live stream, Hangout on Air.
[334.50 → 335.00] Yeah.
[335.20 → 335.60] Okay.
[336.36 → 336.68] Okay.
[338.42 → 342.54] So, you know, I'm not going to be able to get away with doing a half hour segment here,
[342.62 → 346.34] because by the time it's half an hour in, we're going to have barely answered any questions.
[347.96 → 350.52] All right.
[350.58 → 352.32] So, let's get back to some questions here, shall we?
[353.06 → 353.86] Where did we leave off?
[353.92 → 355.24] Live stream says we'll be right back.
[355.30 → 355.50] Yep.
[356.42 → 357.20] Yeah, I broke Google.
[357.38 → 357.82] I know.
[358.00 → 358.32] Okay.
[358.46 → 359.56] I'm scrolling down some more.
[360.56 → 361.46] She read my comment.
[362.68 → 363.64] Massive phantasm.
[363.86 → 365.56] Thank you, Raina, for that.
[365.68 → 370.54] Stream is offline.
[370.54 → 371.04] Stream is offline.
[371.40 → 372.82] How did I get into motorcycling?
[372.90 → 373.22] You know what?
[373.30 → 374.24] Great question, Chris.
[374.24 → 379.16] I started riding a bike when I was very, very young.
[379.26 → 380.36] You know, one of these kinds.
[380.60 → 381.24] No, I'm just kidding.
[381.30 → 382.22] That's not how I got into the middle.
[382.66 → 383.36] My dad.
[383.46 → 384.70] My dad had a motorcycle.
[384.88 → 386.86] Just a little 250cc.
[387.24 → 388.68] It was like Nighthawk or something.
[388.68 → 393.66] You know what's great about this whole, like, browser sharing thing is I can probably actually
[393.66 → 398.20] find what bike he had, and I can show you guys.
[398.32 → 402.96] So, it was a Honda Nighthawk 250, I think.
[402.96 → 405.28] So, I used to ride on the back of this.
[405.96 → 406.68] And, oh, right.
[406.74 → 412.06] I can't press that, too, because that'll change my audio settings.
[413.14 → 413.78] So, there we go.
[414.78 → 416.68] At least I hope that's working now.
[416.86 → 417.00] Yeah.
[417.10 → 417.56] There we go.
[418.04 → 418.38] Okay.
[418.46 → 418.66] Oops.
[419.14 → 420.36] Honda Nighthawk 250.
[420.68 → 421.66] So, we'll search for that.
[422.12 → 422.40] Yeah.
[422.76 → 423.06] Okay.
[423.10 → 424.28] Let's search for a red one, though.
[424.78 → 425.18] Red.
[426.00 → 426.84] And images.
[428.36 → 428.82] There we go.
[428.90 → 433.84] So, I used to ride on the back of one of these little guys with my dad.
[434.94 → 437.52] And, you know, that was fun.
[437.92 → 441.32] And so, I decided at some point that I wanted to get myself a bike.
[441.32 → 446.68] So, when I, you know, grew up and moved out and got my own money, I bought myself an SV650.
[446.68 → 451.18] Took some classes, you know, making sure I actually know how to ride on one.
[451.38 → 453.84] And, yeah, I've been having a blast with it.
[453.92 → 458.88] I haven't actually written it as much as I would have liked this year.
[458.96 → 460.94] But I've been on it for this past week.
[461.00 → 461.68] So, it's been great.
[462.60 → 465.52] Minus, why do gamers love quiet computers and loud keyboards?
[465.70 → 466.50] Great question.
[467.16 → 469.58] Because loud keyboards are a necessary evil.
[469.76 → 473.46] If you want that tactile feedback when you're typing, it makes you faster and more accurate.
[473.86 → 475.90] Whereas loud computers are just annoying.
[476.68 → 479.92] Or, for me personally, it doesn't serve any kind of function.
[480.16 → 482.90] So, it doesn't really float my boat.
[484.70 → 486.84] I should use Metro Twitter as my desktop Twitter app.
[486.88 → 487.46] You're probably right.
[487.54 → 491.92] I have so little experience with Twitter still at this point that I'm learning a lot all the time.
[492.38 → 494.10] So, this is the best I can do right now.
[494.16 → 495.62] So, you're just going to have to live with it.
[497.14 → 499.16] Apparently, I can barely keep my live stream up.
[499.26 → 505.14] So, you guys should be like, you guys should be amazed that I can even manage to show you a Twitter feed.
[505.14 → 507.72] Because in the past, I've always just done this.
[507.82 → 509.94] And just held Twitter up to the screen.
[510.06 → 514.32] And hope that it will magically focus, and you'll be able to see stuff.
[515.26 → 516.62] And hello, show us your cat.
[516.72 → 517.98] So, I don't think I'm going to be able to.
[518.08 → 518.62] Because he's...
[518.62 → 518.96] Well, yeah.
[519.02 → 519.50] Actually, no.
[519.56 → 519.74] There.
[520.90 → 521.26] There.
[521.46 → 522.22] That is my cat.
[522.38 → 522.86] That's Rocket.
[522.86 → 526.86] He's just sort of hanging out on top of the bookshelf.
[526.96 → 527.94] He loves it up there.
[530.40 → 531.02] All right.
[531.32 → 532.62] Kindly lower the quality.
[532.74 → 533.92] I can't stream that fast.
[535.32 → 537.18] Dude, I don't know what to tell you.
[537.60 → 540.50] I can barely figure out how to get it working.
[540.50 → 545.78] So, I don't think I can figure out how to adjust quality.
[546.66 → 546.88] Okay.
[547.48 → 549.38] So, let's go to some of the new questions.
[550.36 → 552.18] And what do I write today?
[552.22 → 553.58] I'm still on the SV650.
[554.92 → 557.42] Oh, that won't work for me.
[558.06 → 561.10] You are just going to have to be banned forever.
[562.18 → 563.62] If there's a way to do that.
[564.18 → 564.90] Ah, yes.
[565.08 → 565.98] You are blocked.
[566.28 → 566.58] Goodbye.
[566.58 → 569.06] Thank you for playing.
[569.78 → 571.10] So, let's move down.
[572.32 → 574.16] Linus, do you prefer Intel or AMD?
[574.66 → 575.38] You know what?
[575.64 → 576.12] Santiago.
[576.36 → 579.12] You're going to have to check out my Intel vs. AMD video.
[579.60 → 584.64] In fact, if you search on YouTube for YouTube.com.
[585.70 → 586.86] Intel vs. AMD.
[587.08 → 589.22] I believe I am actually the first hit.
[590.28 → 593.62] So, there's no excuse for not having searched for this.
[594.00 → 594.52] Oh, no.
[594.60 → 594.96] I'm not.
[595.10 → 595.54] I'm hitting...
[595.54 → 595.80] Oh, no.
[595.80 → 596.56] That's a featured video.
[596.64 → 597.30] That doesn't count.
[597.84 → 599.66] But I'm hit number...
[599.66 → 600.00] Hey, look.
[600.08 → 601.86] I can point at stuff.
[602.24 → 603.20] I'm hit number two.
[603.72 → 606.90] So, if you watch that video, which has 400,000 views.
[607.04 → 607.24] Wow.
[607.36 → 608.28] People care about this.
[608.60 → 611.60] Then you will know that there is no such thing as Intel vs. AMD.
[611.80 → 612.92] And one of them is better than the other.
[613.18 → 614.96] It comes down to each individual product.
[616.14 → 617.06] Sabertoothed X79.
[617.22 → 617.80] Does it coil line?
[617.80 → 619.56] I don't have a Sabertoothed X79.
[619.74 → 621.10] So, I haven't actually tried it.
[622.72 → 623.50] Wei Ming Zhao.
[623.50 → 626.74] Is it possible to do a video comparing onboard audio to a dedicated...
[626.74 → 632.50] I've heard a lot, just subjectively for myself.
[633.14 → 641.88] But, unfortunately, there's not much you can do in terms of empirical benchmarks for audio quality,
[641.88 → 643.52] because so much of it is personal taste.
[643.52 → 648.58] So, what I can tell you guys is that my personal taste is to not use horrible, horrible onboard audio.
[650.28 → 652.20] And if you want to do it, then that's fine.
[652.32 → 654.62] But a dedicated card is definitely better.
[655.18 → 657.04] Have I tried out the G600 mouse yet?
[657.08 → 658.00] I have, actually.
[658.52 → 661.52] So, to give you guys some idea what my impressions were like...
[662.20 → 665.24] That is my Atari laser.
[665.24 → 669.28] And that is the G600.
[670.00 → 670.72] No, that is.
[671.44 → 673.38] That's a Naga, which I like as well.
[673.86 → 674.24] G600.
[675.34 → 678.22] I haven't tried installing the drivers properly for it or anything yet,
[678.26 → 681.24] but my initial impression is that the...
[682.24 → 684.44] There's some delay.
[684.58 → 687.28] There's some input lag that I'm really, really displeased with,
[687.34 → 689.84] that I don't experience with the Naga or with the Atari laser.
[689.84 → 693.50] So, I'm going to give it a chance once I've had some time to install the drivers
[693.50 → 695.30] and actually fire up a game with it.
[695.32 → 696.66] I've had so little time lately.
[698.84 → 699.28] Yeah.
[700.06 → 704.42] Damien, what is the most scary moment in your tech slash computer career?
[705.46 → 706.26] Scary moment?
[708.58 → 709.22] I don't know.
[709.26 → 709.82] It's hard to say.
[709.92 → 716.14] Probably when I braked really hard, and I had an entire tray of OEM AMD processors,
[716.30 → 719.10] unreleased processors, and I braked really hard,
[719.10 → 721.56] and it fell off the back seat down below.
[722.16 → 726.02] And about half a dozen of them, somewhere between three and six of them,
[726.34 → 727.46] ended up with bent pins.
[727.60 → 731.36] One of them was bent so badly that I ended up breaking the pin when I tried to use it.
[731.64 → 734.22] And that was the one I really needed for the Tech Tips video I was doing.
[734.22 → 740.00] So, that's the origin of the legendary broken pins.
[740.66 → 742.96] Cameraman's epic grammar.
[744.94 → 745.42] Here.
[746.00 → 747.72] Fixing a bent slash broken pins.
[747.72 → 749.68] Uh, pin.
[750.24 → 751.88] But that's where that episode came from,
[751.92 → 757.00] because it was an impromptu episode we did when I broke the bent pin as I was trying to unbend it.
[757.46 → 759.68] And we ended up being able to fix it.
[759.68 → 762.66] And that CPU is still running to this day in my parents' computer.
[763.00 → 764.26] So, there you go.
[765.28 → 767.16] Linus, do I have a Linux box?
[767.28 → 768.10] Do I have a Linux computer?
[768.10 → 769.46] I do not, actually.
[769.62 → 771.42] I'm a strictly Windows guy.
[773.26 → 773.58] Ah.
[775.02 → 775.88] Calling Ross.
[775.98 → 779.32] How important is cast latency and memory timings to gaming performance?
[779.50 → 781.34] It makes almost no difference these days.
[781.34 → 793.00] Um, the general rule of thumb is if you go from 99927 down to 88824, that's about the same as going from 1333 to 1600.
[793.00 → 795.68] And both of those differences are very minute.
[795.88 → 805.46] So, if you go from, like, 1333, like, cast 9 memory up to, like, 1866 cast 9 memory, you'll get maybe a couple percent,
[805.46 → 811.00] which will be equivalent to, like, a third of a frame or, you know, like, one extra FPS.
[811.20 → 812.40] You're never going to notice the difference.
[813.18 → 818.84] Usually when people ask me about memory, my suggestion to them is bought the RAM that, like, looks cool with your system
[818.84 → 825.64] because that's about the only thing that matters these days unless you're really out there trying to set performance records
[825.64 → 831.48] and you're really into benchmarking and overclocking your memory and all that kind of jazz.
[831.48 → 835.38] So, I'm thinking of a new build.
[835.46 → 841.92] Would you recommend an i5-3570K and a GTX 660 Ti Power Edition and a BioStar?
[842.20 → 846.36] Okay, well, you had me at the i5 and the GTX 660 Power Edition.
[847.04 → 848.20] I'm a big three guy.
[848.46 → 851.46] If it's not ASUS, Gigabyte, or MSI, I'm really not that interested.
[851.90 → 854.98] So, I would go with anything from those three guys.
[855.60 → 858.28] I can't, guys, Dylan particularly.
[858.56 → 859.94] Dylan, that's you.
[859.94 → 871.52] I can't really answer every question about a particular configuration and I can't walk you, like, I can't hold your hand through overclocking over YouTube.
[871.74 → 873.30] That's just not going to work.
[873.88 → 875.22] Or over private messages.
[875.32 → 877.22] I have so many people message me every day.
[877.28 → 878.44] Linus, I have this configuration.
[878.76 → 883.22] They send me, like, these pager-long YouTube private messages that are like, here's my configuration.
[883.40 → 884.26] Here's all the things I've tried.
[884.36 → 885.18] Can you walk me through this?
[885.18 → 894.14] I'm like, no, I'm sorry, I can't because if I walked everyone who asked me through overclocking, then that would be all I would do all day, every day.
[894.18 → 898.84] And I don't think anyone's going to, like, feed my baby for doing that.
[898.84 → 900.70] So, it's just not that realistic.
[900.88 → 915.44] However, usually, if you search for overclocking guide, if you search for some kind of overclocking guide on YouTube, I will have some kind of guide up there.
[915.44 → 922.70] So, it might help a little bit to throw in the NCI keyword.
[924.68 → 925.42] There you go.
[925.58 → 929.18] AMD Phenom 2 X6 overclocking tutorial with 400,000 hits.
[929.72 → 940.18] So, Dylan, you've got to find these videos as opposed to sort of asking me on Twitter because it's, yeah, I could help you overclock 140 characters at a time,
[940.18 → 942.06] but it's not that doable.
[943.70 → 944.06] Hmm.
[944.54 → 947.50] Wow, it's really warm in this room with all these lights and computers.
[947.72 → 962.22] I've got my test bench running with my 7 hard drive RAID and 512 gig Samsung 830 SSD as a cache running on an Adapted RAID card.
[962.22 → 972.38] I've got that going on in here, and that's producing some heat, and then I've got, sorry, I'm just trying to, got my wife's computer there,
[972.68 → 982.48] then I've got my computer there, and then I've got this laptop here, and then I've got that light and that light, and that door,
[982.64 → 987.98] that door needs to remain pretty closed because there's a baby sleeping on the other side of it.
[987.98 → 994.98] That's why I really wanted to do this downstairs in the kitchen, but if he wakes up, then I guess maybe he'll join us.
[995.14 → 996.72] So that'll be, that'll be fun for everyone.
[1000.08 → 1005.14] For a computer to record music in, what is the thing I can cheap out on, and what is the must for me?
[1005.58 → 1011.84] Well, if you're going to be doing any music edit, like serious, like multi-track music editing, you'll need a decent processor, you'll need a decent amount of RAM.
[1011.84 → 1019.66] You don't need a video card pretty much. Make sure it's quiet, though, because the worst thing in the world is to be trying to do music recording,
[1019.80 → 1026.26] and you've got fans going in the background, so yeah, definitely spend money on making sure it's really silent.
[1027.40 → 1029.60] Are Ducky Shines good mechanical keyboards? Yes.
[1029.60 → 1038.36] I haven't used one extensively myself, but Slick swears by it, and his opinion is pretty much all I need to hear for most things.
[1038.56 → 1039.66] He's very knowledgeable.
[1044.28 → 1052.10] You know what? Why don't we have a look at some of the newer, 161 new interactions?
[1052.10 → 1052.74] Alright, awesome.
[1056.58 → 1061.00] 172 new interactions. Okay, you guys are, you guys are, you guys are killing me here.
[1064.96 → 1066.50] This is interesting.
[1068.04 → 1072.64] 7A wants to know what chair I would suggest for sitting done for a long period of time.
[1073.48 → 1074.74] A comfortable one.
[1075.24 → 1079.82] The great thing about chairs is that they are really easy to try before you buy,
[1079.82 → 1085.32] so you take your butt, and you put it in the chair and you sort of wiggle around a little bit
[1085.32 → 1090.84] and you see if it's compatible, you know, if there's like a good surface contact
[1090.84 → 1094.40] between the bum and the chair cushions, and
[1094.40 → 1096.96] I mean, come on now, what do you want me to say?
[1097.44 → 1099.90] This is like tech Q&A, not like chairs.
[1104.80 → 1106.14] I don't listen to Daft Punk.
[1106.32 → 1108.22] I don't have any computer programming knowledge.
[1108.22 → 1113.10] In fact, I can hardly, I can hardly, like, make things bold when I'm trying to do
[1113.10 → 1118.70] merchandising on NCI, like with the, you know, the little thing and like the B in the middle
[1118.70 → 1119.88] and then like the slash B.
[1120.62 → 1121.28] Sorry, guys.
[1121.38 → 1123.26] I'm pretty much a strict hardware guy.
[1124.58 → 1127.68] Julian, did you ever think you'd be doing what you do for a living?
[1128.18 → 1130.96] If the whole YouTube thing failed, where do you think you'd be now?
[1131.12 → 1133.62] Believe it or not, I don't do YouTube for a living, so
[1133.62 → 1137.96] did I ever think I'd be a product manager for a living?
[1138.24 → 1139.76] No, that wasn't what I was expecting.
[1140.40 → 1144.80] I was expecting to be a sales guy, and then I wasn't really sure what would happen from there,
[1144.92 → 1148.50] and so the whole product management thing really fell into my lap.
[1150.10 → 1151.50] And it's been good.
[1151.58 → 1151.94] It's been good.
[1151.94 → 1154.40] But no, YouTube is, YouTube is not a real job, actually.
[1154.48 → 1158.60] This is something that I wanted to talk about a fair bit because I had someone send me,
[1159.14 → 1162.62] send me a private message on YouTube about their attempts.
[1163.20 → 1167.04] They're trying to do like those gameplay videos, which honestly, guys, I mean,
[1167.06 → 1171.58] if you can enlighten me, I really don't understand the charm and the appeal of this whole like,
[1171.94 → 1175.10] I'm playing video games, and I'm rambling into my mic about like,
[1175.10 → 1180.00] oh, the thing blew up and like, oh man, that reminds me of the time that I was, you know,
[1180.58 → 1182.08] chasing my cat and it blew up.
[1182.22 → 1183.56] Like, I don't really understand.
[1185.28 → 1188.34] So he's doing these gameplay videos, and he sends me this message.
[1188.44 → 1190.34] It was very, it was very heartfelt.
[1190.64 → 1195.28] So I actually, I read the whole thing and I watched a couple of his videos and he's like,
[1195.34 → 1196.50] dude, I want to do YouTube.
[1196.60 → 1197.32] I want to do YouTube.
[1197.56 → 1198.60] Like, this is my calling.
[1199.22 → 1203.14] And he's been at it for about five years now, and he's got 4,000 subscribers,
[1203.14 → 1207.30] but I don't think many of them are that active because new videos are only getting about 30 views.
[1207.84 → 1214.86] So for context, I've got around almost 200,000 subscribers and every video gets around, you know,
[1214.90 → 1218.42] at least 30,000 views, which means a lot of that's coming from the subscribed viewers.
[1219.10 → 1221.80] So I'm just kind of looking at this and going, man, what do you want me to tell you?
[1221.84 → 1223.64] Because YouTube is not a real job.
[1223.74 → 1227.38] There are very few guys out there who don't need a day job anymore.
[1227.48 → 1230.90] I mean, if your name isn't Philip DeFranco, Ray William Johnson,
[1230.90 → 1236.08] some of these, some of these like game streaming guys who are very popular
[1236.08 → 1240.32] and it really can't figure it out, you have a real job, or you're, you know,
[1240.38 → 1242.50] going to school, or you're doing something else.
[1242.52 → 1243.36] You have another plan.
[1243.50 → 1246.10] YouTube, I mean, YouTube can go away as fast as it came.
[1246.98 → 1249.42] It's, it's, I was kind of marvelling the other day.
[1249.48 → 1251.06] YouTube started up in what, 2004?
[1251.96 → 1252.86] That's eight years ago.
[1252.98 → 1253.56] That's nothing.
[1253.96 → 1257.24] I mean, if you're planning a career, like my wife's a pharmacist.
[1257.24 → 1259.58] So that, that is a career.
[1259.96 → 1262.24] YouTube, YouTube is not a career.
[1262.40 → 1263.68] I mean, I do this because it's fun.
[1263.74 → 1266.54] I do this because I like to educate people.
[1268.90 → 1270.10] Yeah, I enjoy it.
[1270.12 → 1270.78] I love the hardware.
[1270.96 → 1274.66] I mean, I love playing with, you know, the latest like cool stuff
[1274.66 → 1277.16] and just kind of having it sitting there, you know,
[1277.30 → 1283.42] getting like Linus edition RAM that doesn't exist outside the six sticks of it that I own.
[1283.42 → 1286.54] I mean, that kind of stuff really gets me excited, so that's why I do it, not because,
[1286.72 → 1288.32] not because it's a career.
[1288.84 → 1290.40] And where do I think I'd be now without YouTube?
[1290.58 → 1291.80] Well, I'd be just product managing.
[1292.22 → 1295.90] And I wouldn't have all of you fun people to talk to on my Friday night.
[1296.60 → 1301.80] It's funny because I was, when I was, when I was figuring out when to,
[1301.86 → 1306.12] when to schedule these live streams on a weekly basis, I was like, oh, what night works?
[1306.20 → 1310.12] I was like, oh, you know, Friday night should be pretty good because at the end of the work week,
[1310.12 → 1314.04] you know, I'm pretty tired and, you know, it might be nice to just kind of hang out
[1314.04 → 1316.24] and sit and stream in front of the camera for a bit.
[1316.86 → 1320.18] And it didn't even occur to me that, you know, people go out on a Friday night.
[1320.58 → 1323.68] And the funny thing is, you guys apparently don't go out on a Friday night either.
[1324.04 → 1328.74] Although, it's okay, I'm just messing with you because I'm sure a lot of you are actually located,
[1328.92 → 1331.44] you know, around the globe and it's not Friday night.
[1331.68 → 1335.10] It's like Saturday morning or whatever else.
[1335.26 → 1337.08] Oh, someone wants me to show the Linus RAM again.
[1337.08 → 1340.14] This is the Linus edition RAM. It has a special colour scheme.
[1340.84 → 1344.72] My understanding is this never actually existed anywhere else.
[1345.38 → 1346.88] Yes, I've heard of the Raspberry Pi.
[1347.02 → 1348.92] However, I haven't actually physically seen one yet.
[1348.98 → 1352.54] And I don't get too excited about hardware that doesn't physically exist yet
[1352.54 → 1359.86] because I've got way too many, like, fascinating things that do exist that I can focus on.
[1360.34 → 1362.32] Okay, Curtis has a question. Curtis, right there.
[1362.92 → 1365.36] AS Rock isn't part of the big three. What's good about their products?
[1365.36 → 1367.54] You're right. AS Rock isn't part of the big three.
[1367.78 → 1371.16] And you will find no AS Rock motherboards deployed in anything that I do.
[1371.64 → 1375.00] I did try out their Extreme 11 just to find out if it had coil line.
[1375.16 → 1381.92] But as I've found so many times in the past, with anything but a tier one motherboard,
[1382.52 → 1386.30] there's some sort of nagging thing that isn't going to work for me.
[1386.30 → 1388.98] So on that one, it was the loud chipset fan.
[1389.06 → 1394.24] And I had a lot of people send me links to MCW-30s or other generic chipset coolers.
[1394.36 → 1395.70] And I appreciate the help.
[1395.84 → 1398.34] But believe it or not, it did occur to me.
[1398.98 → 1402.40] I have an MCW-30 sitting in that room over there.
[1402.68 → 1403.80] See? Behind that door.
[1403.80 → 1407.16] It's not like I don't know what it is.
[1407.88 → 1412.50] And MCW-30 won't help because there are four chips under that heat sink.
[1412.74 → 1413.88] Four. Not just one.
[1413.94 → 1415.84] And MCW-30 is big enough to cover one.
[1416.28 → 1420.08] So there are two PLX chips which need to be actively cooled.
[1420.44 → 1426.16] There is one SAS controller from LSI that probably needs to be actively cooled.
[1426.26 → 1427.18] And then there's the self-bridge.
[1427.18 → 1430.30] So unless there's a custom block, not happening.
[1432.18 → 1434.92] Can I recommend a headset for around $50 to $150?
[1435.50 → 1436.42] That's quite the range.
[1436.60 → 1438.42] I would recommend the Steel Series 7H.
[1438.78 → 1442.78] If you don't mind dealing with the sort of foobar connector here,
[1442.82 → 1444.08] if you're willing to be careful with it,
[1444.38 → 1447.26] it's the best balance between comfort and sound quality and price.
[1447.38 → 1448.46] That's out there pretty much.
[1448.78 → 1451.96] If you want something wireless, the Vengeance 2000 is a very good choice from Corsair.
[1452.80 → 1455.70] If you don't want something wireless, Vengeance 1300 is not a bad bet either.
[1457.18 → 1468.40] And if you don't mind letting it be, you know,
[1468.48 → 1470.06] in order to Douay with your kitchen,
[1470.28 → 1472.44] if you're interested in playing sort of like,
[1472.74 → 1474.58] you're playing your Anime D so it's basically on one-click.
[1474.68 → 1479.22] For individual criticized, at least that camera user feeds you,
[1479.30 → 1482.02] what is a release out of include an Android dashboard?
[1482.18 → 1485.26] That's one of the best areas that you'd like to have to do after.
[1485.26 → 1487.26] stand behind their products.
[1487.26 → 1490.88] Yeah, what else is there to say?
[1490.88 → 1493.40] They have some products that do have a lifetime warranty still.
[1493.40 → 1496.50] Anything with AR and the part number does have a lifetime warranty.
[1496.50 → 1499.64] They have other cool warranty perks that other guys don't necessarily have, so they have
[1499.64 → 1506.80] a global warranty that is based on the purchase date and serial number, not based on the invoice,
[1506.80 → 1509.94] which means that you can resell your VGA card, and they will still honour the warranty
[1509.94 → 1511.68] on it, which is pretty cool.
[1511.68 → 1513.68] Not everyone does that.
[1513.68 → 1519.08] This is a good question down there.
[1519.08 → 1520.54] A lot of people ask me this.
[1520.54 → 1526.02] Should I run two SSDs in RAID 0, or should I resell my current one and buy a bigger SSD?
[1526.02 → 1530.80] For 99.9% of people, a single SSD is going to be the solution you want.
[1530.80 → 1536.68] I know I run eight SSDs in RAID 0, but I have almost zero important data that I actually
[1536.68 → 1538.92] keep on my computer, like nothing.
[1538.92 → 1540.88] So I'm not worried about it.
[1540.88 → 1546.28] I do nightly backups, and I run almost everything directly off of my Windows Home Server.
[1546.28 → 1553.82] So RAID does increase the chances that you will suffer a catastrophic data failure.
[1553.82 → 1556.34] So I'd say why chance it?
[1556.34 → 1562.74] I personally can't really feel the difference between like a low performance SSD and a high
[1562.74 → 1567.54] performance SSD and like a daily driver type of usage scenario and I doubt you can either.
[1567.54 → 1570.84] And it's kind of the same thing when you go from a single high performance SSD to a RAID
[1570.84 → 1572.74] 0 configuration.
[1572.74 → 1574.68] I don't know what I'm looking for.
[1574.68 → 1575.64] I mean, we're going to do this for 20 more minutes here, guys.
[1575.64 → 1578.14] I think we're going to call it quits after 20 more minutes so it would be like midnight
[1578.14 → 1588.64] snack time, if nothing else, instead of lunchtime.
[1588.64 → 1592.46] be like midnight snack time, if nothing else, instead of lunchtime.
[1596.30 → 1598.86] Okay, so apparently that didn't work last time.
[1600.54 → 1604.86] Apparently, I don't know how to block people on Twitter, so...
[1604.86 → 1608.86] Blocked.
[1609.00 → 1611.72] Okay, so hopefully we won't see anything else from this character.
[1612.72 → 1614.92] What do I hope my son's first words are?
[1615.82 → 1618.54] Hopefully like dad or mom, something along those lines.
[1618.90 → 1620.06] Keep it simple.
[1622.08 → 1624.06] My favourite hockey team is the Vancouver Canucks.
[1624.14 → 1624.86] Thank you for asking.
[1625.38 → 1630.44] Although I am super, super disappointed that it looks like the NHL's going to go to a lockout this year.
[1630.92 → 1636.92] I think that's just far more devastating to the sport than Commissioner Gary Batsman thinks.
[1637.96 → 1642.58] And yeah, that guy's such a yahoo.
[1645.26 → 1648.06] Jen Ends wants to know what I think about that leaked iPhone 5 video.
[1648.06 → 1650.20] You know, I honestly haven't seen it, and I really don't care.
[1650.68 → 1654.18] Like I said, I don't have that much interest in hardware that I can't actually touch.
[1654.86 → 1659.68] So yeah, when I can actually get my hands on an iPhone 5 and play with it, then I'll definitely
[1659.68 → 1662.00] be interested to check it out.
[1662.58 → 1664.28] Oh, Slick is apparently here.
[1664.36 → 1664.90] Yeah, come on in.
[1664.90 → 1667.84] Apparently he's right outside the door there.
[1670.86 → 1672.78] Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1672.82 → 1673.60] We can't show his face.
[1673.68 → 1674.28] We can't show his face.
[1674.36 → 1674.90] No, no, it's okay.
[1674.96 → 1675.22] It's okay.
[1675.30 → 1675.60] Come on.
[1676.06 → 1677.08] Just don't...
[1677.08 → 1677.52] Oh, look.
[1677.56 → 1678.18] There's Rumble, too.
[1678.62 → 1679.12] There's my kitty.
[1680.46 → 1680.78] See?
[1680.92 → 1681.24] Hi, kitty.
[1682.42 → 1682.68] Hey.
[1683.20 → 1683.90] Yeah, he's...
[1683.90 → 1684.60] Who are you talking to?
[1685.70 → 1686.26] There he goes.
[1687.26 → 1687.80] Oh, oh, oh.
[1687.86 → 1688.34] We almost...
[1688.34 → 1688.86] Oh, oh, oh.
[1688.94 → 1689.20] I don't...
[1689.20 → 1690.10] I think it's too low res.
[1690.16 → 1692.86] I don't think you guys will be able to make out any details, but there's Slick in the window.
[1693.76 → 1694.50] Everyone loves that.
[1694.68 → 1694.80] See?
[1694.96 → 1697.00] This is how the cats get up on the bookshelf, by the way.
[1697.88 → 1698.32] There you go.
[1699.02 → 1699.24] See?
[1699.54 → 1700.46] Up on the bookshelf there.
[1700.50 → 1701.18] It's pretty good stuff.
[1701.96 → 1704.02] Okay, so let's go back to the live stream.
[1704.02 → 1705.88] So I sent Slick a message.
[1706.24 → 1710.04] I don't know if you've read my email that I sent you like an hour ago.
[1710.84 → 1711.04] Okay.
[1711.62 → 1717.32] So Slick, I have tasked him with the task of coming up with a more effective way for
[1717.32 → 1721.08] us to test SSDs, because, like, look at all these SSDs we've got here.
[1721.44 → 1725.92] We've got, like, the Crucial one, and we've got, like, the Plex store one, and I'm going
[1725.92 → 1729.38] to rip the Vertex 4 out of my wife's computer so that we can test that, too.
[1730.60 → 1736.30] And the problem is that PC Mark 7 is not cooperating with us all the time, so we definitely want
[1736.30 → 1736.70] a...
[1736.70 → 1739.46] We definitely want a better way to benchmark stuff.
[1739.46 → 1743.76] And Slick finally brought back the 3570K that he borrowed.
[1743.86 → 1744.94] How long ago did you borrow this?
[1745.56 → 1746.32] Two months ago?
[1746.58 → 1747.42] Three months ago?
[1747.90 → 1748.58] So here.
[1748.70 → 1753.40] He has brought this back to me after much nagging.
[1753.94 → 1754.14] See?
[1754.32 → 1754.92] Intel Confidential.
[1754.92 → 1757.46] You guys aren't going to be able to read this, but it says Intel Confidential.
[1757.50 → 1758.40] You're going to have to trust me.
[1758.68 → 1761.30] And it's a 3570K, and I finally have it back.
[1761.62 → 1764.46] So, yeah.
[1765.94 → 1766.68] Exciting somehow.
[1766.68 → 1767.68] Okay.
[1767.80 → 1769.04] Let's see if we can find some more tweets.
[1769.94 → 1770.66] So check this out.
[1770.66 → 1772.48] I'm using XSplit.
[1772.74 → 1773.54] So I can actually...
[1773.54 → 1774.42] This is my live stream.
[1774.50 → 1779.96] So I can stream, like, tweets, so people can see what I'm answering at the same time that
[1779.96 → 1780.58] I'm answering it.
[1780.64 → 1781.06] Isn't that great?
[1781.42 → 1782.38] Slick's giving me the nod.
[1782.42 → 1783.48] He doesn't look that impressed, though.
[1783.48 → 1784.48] So...
[1784.48 → 1787.34] Kyle.
[1787.34 → 1792.14] Thank you, Kyle.
[1792.40 → 1794.86] And, you know, hail Victoria and all of that.
[1795.52 → 1796.08] Good stuff.
[1797.42 → 1800.84] Well, Victoria's not the island, but I'm just assuming you live in Victoria, because you probably
[1800.84 → 1803.90] wouldn't have an internet connection if you weren't in Victoria.
[1805.18 → 1805.76] I'm sorry.
[1805.82 → 1806.04] I'm sorry.
[1806.10 → 1807.44] It's not total wilderness over there.
[1807.48 → 1809.76] I'm sure that there's lots of civilized something.
[1809.76 → 1811.20] Eric Bentley.
[1811.46 → 1815.00] If I'm not gaming, but using applications like Premiere and After Effects, will Squadron
[1815.00 → 1816.82] cards give me a great benefit on rendering?
[1817.24 → 1817.68] You know what?
[1817.72 → 1821.16] There are a lot of great articles out there about the benefits of Squadron cards.
[1821.62 → 1822.44] So if you're...
[1822.44 → 1824.48] I actually was doing some reading about this recently.
[1824.60 → 1829.94] So if you're doing editing in 4K, for example, it can accelerate the playback process, so you
[1829.94 → 1832.72] can play back a lot of what you're working on.
[1832.78 → 1835.62] You can preview it in real time as opposed to rendering it first.
[1835.62 → 1841.74] So it has some really cool benefits, but nothing for gaming whatsoever.
[1842.20 → 1842.96] So you know what?
[1843.12 → 1845.92] Do some research specifically on Premiere and After Effects.
[1846.06 → 1850.84] Find out if it accelerates the things that you're doing, and if it does, then yes, go
[1850.84 → 1851.10] for it.
[1851.12 → 1851.76] Get a Squadron.
[1852.92 → 1856.66] And I'm probably going to be looking into one in the near future for some upcoming projects
[1856.66 → 1859.94] as well, so you and I can be learning how to use Squadron bodies.
[1860.72 → 1863.46] Amir wants to know if I've ever tried liquid nitrogen overclocking.
[1863.46 → 1864.56] I actually have not.
[1864.56 → 1873.82] The most I've done is around minus 20 to minus 25 degrees with a chilled windshield de-ice.
[1874.64 → 1876.98] So that's what I was into for a little bit.
[1877.06 → 1878.56] That was on my...
[1878.56 → 1880.92] What were they called?
[1881.02 → 1882.98] Core 2 Duo E6600.
[1883.38 → 1885.60] And I had that thing at 4 gigahertz.
[1886.12 → 1886.56] Stable.
[1886.84 → 1887.94] 24-7 stable.
[1888.28 → 1889.94] On my P5WDH.
[1890.42 → 1891.14] It was boss.
[1891.14 → 1897.34] And the air conditioner unit that sat next to my computer actually weighed far more than
[1897.34 → 1897.88] the computer.
[1898.56 → 1902.22] And I hardcore destroyed that board with all the insulation that I put on it and everything.
[1902.50 → 1904.50] It was fun, but it's the kind of thing you do once.
[1904.98 → 1907.58] Kind of like Slick's oil-cooled computer, which recently died.
[1907.96 → 1909.12] Slick, can I get a sad face?
[1909.52 → 1910.70] He's given me the sad face.
[1910.84 → 1912.28] So it died, and it's gone.
[1912.28 → 1914.10] And he's not going to do it again, but it was fun.
[1917.44 → 1919.24] Linus, I saw a meal on your picture feed.
[1919.26 → 1919.86] It looked vegan.
[1920.20 → 1920.98] I am not vegan.
[1921.38 → 1922.96] And I have no idea what you're talking about.
[1923.30 → 1925.22] Because everything I eat has meat in it.
[1926.28 → 1928.28] But seriously, I actually don't know.
[1928.40 → 1929.92] I mean, I take out pictures of a lot of food.
[1930.08 → 1932.26] Like, I think I took a picture of, like, cereal.
[1932.26 → 1935.86] And so, oh, no, that's not vegan anyway, because milk is delicious.
[1937.04 → 1939.90] Actually, milk's not delicious, but cereal's really gross without it.
[1941.70 → 1943.04] So that's where we're at.
[1943.94 → 1945.16] I actually hate milk.
[1945.78 → 1947.84] But have you ever tried apple juice and cereal?
[1948.22 → 1949.04] Because I have.
[1950.66 → 1951.66] It was awful.
[1952.28 → 1953.78] Apple juice and Rice Kris pies.
[1954.20 → 1957.40] And because I poured it, my mom made me finish eating it.
[1957.40 → 1962.28] It was the worst experience ever.
[1962.46 → 1963.50] So it got so soggy.
[1964.40 → 1966.02] I'm, like, taking these bites.
[1966.30 → 1969.50] I'm, like, mom, don't make me eat this anymore.
[1970.08 → 1971.34] I'm, like, four, right?
[1971.74 → 1974.66] But these are the kinds of traumatic memories that stick with you.
[1976.92 → 1978.70] Thank you for reminding me of that.
[1978.92 → 1980.50] I'm, like, tearing up now.
[1980.62 → 1981.28] It's fantastic.
[1982.52 → 1986.60] Right wants to know if I know that Raptor Gaming Peripheral's brand has been acquired by Corsair.
[1986.60 → 1987.22] I did know that.
[1987.40 → 1991.10] It's a lower-cost brand that they can bring lower-cost referrals to the market under.
[1991.70 → 1994.94] And I've got a good buddy of mine who's the general manager of Corsair in Canada.
[1995.08 → 1997.44] So he let me know all about it.
[1997.46 → 1999.30] And I was, like, okay, cool.
[2000.04 → 2002.04] And that's pretty much where the conversation went.
[2003.52 → 2006.44] Diego, can you announce your hangouts a few days earlier on your Tech Tips channel?
[2006.92 → 2007.34] I do.
[2009.24 → 2012.36] But I know that not everybody sees everything.
[2012.36 → 2021.62] Do you know what?
[2022.04 → 2022.14] Okay.
[2022.56 → 2023.64] Oh, McHale.
[2023.82 → 2024.88] Yes, I've chosen a motherboard.
[2025.00 → 2030.56] I'm going to be using it as Gigabyte X79S UD5P or something along those lines.
[2031.56 → 2032.04] UD5P?
[2032.04 → 2033.06] Yeah, I think something like that.
[2033.10 → 2035.24] The new C606 chipset one.
[2035.74 → 2036.50] It's outstanding.
[2036.74 → 2039.80] All-new power design that doesn't squeal.
[2040.00 → 2040.64] It's awesome.
[2040.64 → 2048.98] As for all the people who were upset about sort of how picky I was about my high-end products
[2048.98 → 2052.60] and whether they make whining noises or not, you know, people are calling me a diva and
[2052.60 → 2052.82] whatnot.
[2053.00 → 2053.94] Okay, maybe I'm a diva.
[2054.24 → 2059.98] But if you spend $300 on something, do you expect it to be perfect when it's a motherboard
[2059.98 → 2062.98] and its sole purpose is to plug in other things?
[2063.06 → 2064.52] It actually doesn't do anything else.
[2064.52 → 2070.14] It does not contribute to the performance of your computer beyond making sure it's using,
[2070.24 → 2075.66] you know, a reasonably good sound chipset or LAN chipset or whatever else.
[2076.00 → 2077.40] So, yeah, yeah.
[2077.62 → 2080.36] It's unacceptable to me if it makes weird, obnoxious noises.
[2080.56 → 2081.80] So, there you go.
[2082.16 → 2082.42] No.
[2082.82 → 2085.84] I think we should all hold the hardware manufacturers to higher standards.
[2085.84 → 2093.30] I want some true tests on a 7970 toxic because no one has done an empirical test.
[2093.74 → 2095.88] Joseph, it's totally irrelevant because...
[2095.88 → 2096.90] Here, Joseph, right there.
[2097.26 → 2104.86] Because a 7970 at clock speed X and Y for the core and the memory equals some other 7970
[2104.86 → 2106.98] at core speed X and memory Y.
[2107.10 → 2111.50] So, find some guy who has one and who's willing to benchmark it at the same as the toxic default
[2111.50 → 2114.34] clocks, and you'll know exactly how well it will perform.
[2114.34 → 2115.60] There is no voodoo magic.
[2116.28 → 2120.22] Clock speed equals clock speed when we're using the same GPU with the same frame buffer.
[2121.84 → 2125.52] Linus, do you think we are ever going to see DDR4 and is there a possibility that single
[2125.52 → 2126.70] sticks could hold 16 gigs?
[2127.86 → 2129.08] Oh, cool, J0.
[2129.28 → 2133.28] That's about like asking me if we're ever going to see processors that perform better than
[2133.28 → 2133.94] the ones today.
[2134.68 → 2135.58] Yes, of course we will.
[2139.86 → 2143.84] Linus, I'd like to know if I'm better off going with an i5 or i7 third generation for
[2143.84 → 2144.70] gaming and some rendering.
[2145.18 → 2147.88] If you're doing rendering, you want the i7 with hyperthreading.
[2148.12 → 2150.16] If you're just gaming and i5 will do you just fine.
[2151.64 → 2156.18] Brandon Olson, will I ever interview Linus Torvalds for a video called Linus on Linus?
[2156.44 → 2160.80] I can tell you right now, if I ever did, the video would not be called Linus on Linus because
[2160.80 → 2161.68] that's just terrible.
[2165.78 → 2166.98] You guys are killing me here.
[2166.98 → 2169.52] See, look, you're killing me again.
[2170.22 → 2171.40] 476 new interactions.
[2172.72 → 2178.42] Okay, next week we're going to switch to Twitch TV, and we are definitely going to change the
[2178.42 → 2182.70] format of the questions people are sending in because I'm going to use slow mode so that
[2182.70 → 2185.86] people can't send me the same questions over and over again because it really makes it
[2185.86 → 2188.84] harder for me to get to everybody's questions.
[2190.44 → 2191.60] Here we've got Amir.
[2191.80 → 2192.92] How much is my electricity bill?
[2192.92 → 2193.54] I don't know.
[2193.54 → 2194.60] My wife deals with it.
[2195.66 → 2196.60] So, yeah.
[2196.92 → 2197.46] There you go.
[2199.36 → 2200.04] All right.
[2201.06 → 2205.18] So, yeah.
[2205.28 → 2207.02] This guy's really ruining it for everyone here.
[2207.78 → 2208.62] That's a real shame.
[2210.50 → 2211.24] B-roll.
[2211.96 → 2213.70] Best headset for gaming and music.
[2213.80 → 2214.22] 7H.
[2214.56 → 2214.84] Done.
[2214.84 → 2219.86] And anything with a clip-on mic is...
[2219.86 → 2220.38] Oh, oh.
[2220.46 → 2222.62] Use a headset with a built-in mic or headphones with a clip-on mic.
[2222.68 → 2224.18] That depends on your...
[2224.18 → 2225.14] Well, it depends on what you want to do.
[2225.22 → 2226.54] You want to use headphones with a clip-on mic?
[2226.60 → 2226.88] Do that.
[2227.30 → 2229.50] There's much better headphones out there than there are headsets.
[2229.58 → 2230.88] Most headsets are not very good.
[2231.42 → 2232.24] Especially these.
[2232.30 → 2233.30] They're incredibly uncomfortable.
[2236.90 → 2237.26] Okay.
[2237.26 → 2237.52] Okay.
[2237.52 → 2247.04] Luke wants to know, DOG for gaming or not?
[2247.30 → 2248.52] The answer is...
[2249.38 → 2253.22] So, you're asking me if a Republic of Gamers product is for gaming.
[2254.08 → 2254.50] Yes.
[2255.04 → 2257.40] Do you want to spend the extra on an DOG product?
[2257.50 → 2257.94] It depends.
[2258.06 → 2258.82] They have some perks.
[2258.94 → 2262.40] They have some extra stuff that you might like.
[2262.44 → 2264.02] And if you like it, then you should buy one.
[2264.30 → 2266.08] And if you don't like it, then you probably shouldn't.
[2266.08 → 2270.30] I mean, I think there are so many articles and so many reviews
[2270.30 → 2273.78] and so many forum threads about all of these products
[2273.78 → 2278.82] that it's really not that complicated to figure out if it makes sense for you.
[2279.22 → 2280.24] If you know you need...
[2280.24 → 2281.26] I guess here's the answer.
[2281.36 → 2285.78] If you know you need the features on a Rampage or Maximus-level board,
[2286.32 → 2287.20] then buy one.
[2287.20 → 2288.98] And if you don't know that you need it,
[2289.10 → 2290.72] then the answer is that you probably don't.
[2291.12 → 2294.68] And ASUS has lots of other fantastic products that are not DOG branded.
[2294.68 → 2297.80] If you like the colour scheme, there's another reason you might want to buy one.
[2300.96 → 2305.54] Should I get a GTX 690 or a GTX 680?
[2306.60 → 2308.32] You have a 1440 screen.
[2308.54 → 2311.58] You should get a 660 Ti.
[2312.40 → 2313.90] Oh, you mean...
[2313.90 → 2317.68] Ah, see, I thought you meant 1440 by 900 or whatever that weird resolution is.
[2317.68 → 2321.96] No, you mean 2560 by 1440.
[2323.08 → 2323.66] I don't know.
[2323.70 → 2324.26] Get a 680.
[2324.42 → 2325.78] If you don't like it, get another 680.
[2325.86 → 2327.80] It'll be the same net result as your 690.
[2328.98 → 2330.58] One of my favourite Cherry MX keys.
[2330.80 → 2331.90] Generally speaking, blues.
[2332.06 → 2334.90] However, I really like the blacks on the Neon ix Xbox 60.
[2336.04 → 2337.34] Slick's giving me the thumbs up.
[2337.66 → 2339.10] He's such a keyboard diva.
[2339.10 → 2345.66] If we're holding out for 4K monitors, should we wait until next time to operate our GPS?
[2347.22 → 2349.24] I don't know, man.
[2349.76 → 2352.82] I mean, most of the current stuff does support 4K.
[2353.24 → 2358.62] However, 4K is going to be very, very demanding.
[2358.62 → 2362.16] And it's anyone's yes, and I'm crystal ball.
[2362.30 → 2364.12] I don't know.
[2364.54 → 2364.92] I don't know.
[2365.90 → 2372.48] You could probably look at benchmarks people are doing on triple 1080
[2372.48 → 2376.94] to give you some idea of how a card is going to perform at super hot resolution.
[2377.68 → 2385.90] And then you can look at how a card scales from 1080 to 2560 to triple 1080.
[2385.90 → 2390.46] And then you can probably extrapolate that out to how approximately perform at 4K.
[2390.64 → 2392.86] But it's nothing where you don't really have to do math.
[2392.96 → 2396.64] Because that's not math that I'm doing right now in this live stream.
[2398.48 → 2400.46] Is it worth investing in 3D Vision 2?
[2402.04 → 2402.96] Or should I wait?
[2403.32 → 2406.00] I don't know anything coming in the future for 3D Vision.
[2406.24 → 2408.00] Like 3D Vision 3 or anything like that.
[2408.32 → 2409.32] And the light boost is amazing.
[2409.46 → 2414.20] It makes the 3D Vision experience 100 times better than it was.
[2414.20 → 2416.00] So, yeah.
[2416.42 → 2420.96] 3D Vision really doesn't do it for me compared to better colour depth and higher resolution.
[2421.38 → 2423.96] So that's why I'm running a 3D inch on my own PC over there.
[2424.42 → 2428.44] But if you don't mind 1080p, then go for it.
[2428.60 → 2428.98] I mean, yeah.
[2429.12 → 2431.48] Run 3D Vision.
[2431.66 → 2433.00] It's a very new experience.
[2433.56 → 2433.98] But I should...
[2433.98 → 2434.28] Oh, yeah.
[2434.46 → 2435.58] Always try it before you buy it.
[2435.70 → 2436.56] I've always got it.
[2436.62 → 2437.64] I'm in a store where they have it.
[2437.74 → 2438.00] I don't know.
[2438.00 → 2441.12] Because it still gives people some...
[2441.12 → 2442.60] It still gives people headaches sometimes.
[2443.54 → 2444.60] I feel like I sound like a robot.
[2444.96 → 2446.42] Does it help me find this a little closer?
[2446.64 → 2447.02] I don't know.
[2447.76 → 2448.62] It's my pleasing.
[2448.76 → 2449.20] Thank you.
[2449.90 → 2450.12] Yeah.
[2450.28 → 2450.58] I don't know.
[2451.08 → 2451.72] Sorry, guys.
[2452.14 → 2453.70] We've had enough technical difficulties.
[2453.70 → 2458.46] It's been more complicated than the microphone.
[2458.64 → 2460.24] If you guys can hear me, we're going to have a light.
[2460.34 → 2460.80] I'm not sure.
[2461.54 → 2463.78] Nathan wants to know my Fire and Steam name.
[2463.78 → 2466.26] I don't really use Fire and Steam name.
[2466.48 → 2467.30] This is actually full.
[2467.80 → 2468.46] So, sorry.
[2469.32 → 2470.62] I gain very little these days.
[2472.60 → 2475.46] As a fairly private person, question mark,
[2475.54 → 2477.66] how do you react to your interest in your personal life?
[2478.16 → 2479.02] Humble weirdo.
[2479.68 → 2483.44] I'm going to tell you right now that it was really weird at first.
[2484.40 → 2487.34] And I got more used to it over time.
[2487.34 → 2494.78] I mean, there are certain things that I still don't really want to talk about too much.
[2494.90 → 2496.52] I mean, I did post the...
[2496.52 → 2499.64] I thought of it for a long time before I posted a link video online.
[2500.58 → 2504.36] But overall, the community has been very supportive.
[2505.06 → 2509.60] And I think that the people who follow my perspectives, for the most part,
[2509.86 → 2513.12] are representative of sort of the better part of the internet,
[2513.46 → 2514.22] especially YouTube.
[2514.22 → 2519.32] YouTube is like the biggest community of general internet scrubs.
[2519.52 → 2521.88] And I know there are places like 4chan,
[2522.02 → 2526.18] where it's like sort of the concentration of scrubs is higher.
[2526.60 → 2530.34] But because YouTube is so much bigger than something like 4chan could ever be,
[2531.28 → 2533.06] there's still just my sheer volume.
[2533.34 → 2537.70] There's so many people there who are just brutal.
[2537.70 → 2542.52] And I think that the tech tips of all the community does a great job of moderating those guys
[2542.52 → 2545.88] and largely ignoring them and not engaging with them.
[2546.04 → 2550.44] So it makes me more comfortable releasing content while my personal life
[2550.44 → 2553.70] because I think that you guys are more supportive
[2553.70 → 2555.72] than have a half of their connection overall
[2555.72 → 2558.70] than the general internet user up there.
[2558.70 → 2561.16] So three more minutes.
[2562.24 → 2562.84] Tech tips.
[2563.50 → 2564.96] Why do I hide those faces all the time?
[2565.04 → 2565.88] Because he's a camera guy.
[2566.00 → 2568.70] It's not that professional for camera people to...
[2570.14 → 2571.34] Show up their face.
[2572.04 → 2572.36] Right.
[2572.66 → 2573.16] Oh, dude.
[2573.66 → 2574.70] Do you watch wrestling?
[2574.96 → 2575.60] Like WWE?
[2576.74 → 2577.08] Really?
[2578.70 → 2579.34] Oh, man.
[2581.00 → 2581.86] Oh, man.
[2583.12 → 2583.52] Okay.
[2583.52 → 2583.62] Okay.
[2583.62 → 2586.80] Scott.
[2587.76 → 2589.44] I accidentally put unfollow.
[2589.58 → 2590.20] You forgive me.
[2590.90 → 2592.48] But really, I think that's a good question.
[2592.94 → 2593.54] Right there.
[2593.98 → 2596.88] Is there a real difference in our main rates between brands?
[2597.26 → 2598.84] Yes, of course there is.
[2599.38 → 2600.22] Because...
[2600.22 → 2603.38] And it can often be a real difference in our main rates between products.
[2603.54 → 2605.18] I mean, there's a lot of information out there.
[2605.66 → 2608.26] And the challenge is that sometimes...
[2608.26 → 2608.42] Oh.
[2609.28 → 2611.84] Yeah, apparently the microphone is even more problematic.
[2611.84 → 2612.46] And you know what?
[2612.46 → 2613.86] We're two minutes away from the end here, guys.
[2613.96 → 2618.90] So I think we're just totally done with Google Hangouts.
[2619.22 → 2623.10] And hopefully next time around this can be better overall.
[2623.24 → 2624.40] Because we're going to be using TV.
[2625.54 → 2628.12] And so let's try and get back to the real art main rates.
[2628.22 → 2628.92] Yes, there is.
[2629.66 → 2631.12] You can do a lot of research out there.
[2631.22 → 2634.02] And you can find the products pretty easily.
[2634.36 → 2637.48] Generally speaking, although it can be hard to figure out sometimes.
[2637.70 → 2640.70] Because you can see a lot of complaints about our products.
[2640.70 → 2643.26] But that might not be related to the actual failure rate.
[2643.64 → 2645.40] But it might just be a top seller.
[2645.92 → 2647.66] Like an example of the OCC or text.
[2648.08 → 2650.76] People think that it's like this problematic SSD.
[2650.98 → 2652.78] Because there are a lot of complaints about it.
[2653.30 → 2656.96] But the reality of it is, it helps solves almost every other SSD.
[2657.12 → 2658.14] But it's at a large margin.
[2658.50 → 2660.42] And even if they had exactly the same RMA rate,
[2660.50 → 2662.24] there would still be five times as many complaints.
[2662.24 → 2668.04] So, yeah, it can be pretty tough to figure out.
[2668.24 → 2669.14] Okay, last question.
[2669.22 → 2669.74] Last question.
[2670.04 → 2674.30] What minus do you prefer a good TN panel or an Android Loll IPS panel?
[2674.64 → 2677.92] For me personally, anything that's TN.
[2678.82 → 2680.98] Unless you must have 120 nerds.
[2681.06 → 2685.44] Because there's nothing 3D version certified out there that's anything but TN.
[2685.44 → 2696.84] The viewing angles, the colour reproduction, the colour depth is much lower compared to any VA or IPS or KLS panel.
[2697.34 → 2702.08] So, yes, I will take an entry level a little higher end panel first.
[2702.34 → 2703.98] And, yeah, I can't really think it sounds terrible.
[2704.22 → 2704.54] And I'm sorry.
[2704.74 → 2706.66] There's nothing I can do.
[2706.66 → 2709.80] And that pretty much does it for tonight.
[2711.36 → 2712.04] Good night, everyone.
[2712.90 → 2713.28] Peace.
[2713.68 → 2715.82] And maybe this time we're actually not.
[2715.94 → 2718.42] Stay tuned on Twitter as well as on YouTube.
[2718.54 → 2719.40] And I'll let you guys know.
[2719.94 → 2720.60] Signing out.
[2721.92 → 2722.52] And broadcast.
