[0.00 --> 2.00]  We might be live now.
[2.00 --> 4.00]  Yeah, we might.
[4.00 --> 5.00]  Maybe.
[5.00 --> 7.00]  We're not sure.
[11.00 --> 15.00]  Um, so guys, I'm gonna head over to the Twitch chat here.
[15.00 --> 17.00]  Oh, I'm like really far over.
[17.00 --> 19.00]  Oh, we moved the camera.
[19.00 --> 21.00]  Makes a difference.
[21.00 --> 24.00]  Okay. Twitch chat.
[24.00 --> 34.00]  Cause if I sing along with that, then there's a delay.
[34.00 --> 50.00]  Okay. Sorry it took us a while.
[50.00 --> 53.00]  If I talk and type at the same time, that won't be annoying, right?
[53.00 --> 58.00]  And that'll be totally different timing cause the type will go through way faster.
[58.00 --> 61.00]  Yeah. How's the, uh, the thing?
[61.00 --> 63.00]  With the stream?
[63.00 --> 65.00]  How's the audio?
[65.00 --> 67.00]  It sounds good to me.
[67.00 --> 71.00]  Apparently there's bloody echo.
[71.00 --> 74.00]  Bloody echo? Bloody echo?
[74.00 --> 76.00]  Alright then.
[76.00 --> 79.00]  Hmm.
[79.00 --> 81.00]  Where would the echo come from?
[81.00 --> 84.00]  We've got a lot of things going all over the place.
[84.00 --> 85.00]  I'm not sure.
[85.00 --> 86.00]  Here.
[88.00 --> 89.00]  Well.
[89.00 --> 91.00]  That was a motherboard.
[91.00 --> 92.00]  I can't-
[92.00 --> 93.00]  Okay.
[93.00 --> 98.00]  I don't see anything that looks like...
[98.00 --> 101.00]  Echo on Razor comms?
[101.00 --> 102.00]  Oh.
[102.00 --> 103.00]  Hold on.
[103.00 --> 104.00]  Let's check comms.
[104.00 --> 105.00]  So if we mute myself?
[105.00 --> 106.00]  You're not talking.
[106.00 --> 107.00]  Yeah.
[107.00 --> 108.00]  Doesn't make any sense.
[108.00 --> 110.00]  Someone says there's no echo.
[110.00 --> 111.00]  Echo's gone.
[111.00 --> 112.00]  Okay.
[112.00 --> 113.00]  Okay.
[113.00 --> 114.00]  No echo.
[114.00 --> 115.00]  No echo.
[115.00 --> 116.00]  Okay.
[116.00 --> 117.00]  Okay.
[117.00 --> 118.00]  No echo.
[118.00 --> 119.00]  Okay.
[119.00 --> 120.00]  No echo.
[120.00 --> 121.00]  Okay.
[121.00 --> 122.00]  Okay.
[122.00 --> 123.00]  Cool.
[123.00 --> 124.00]  Nope.
[124.00 --> 125.00]  Clean.
[125.00 --> 126.00]  It's quiet now.
[126.00 --> 127.00]  Okay.
[127.00 --> 128.00]  It's magically fixed itself.
[128.00 --> 129.00]  Oh.
[129.00 --> 130.00]  I think I know what it might be.
[130.00 --> 131.00]  I'm going to turn the volume down of my headphones.
[131.00 --> 157.54]  These aren't very noise isolating headphones so it's possible that it's actually picking
[157.54 --> 160.54]  up this through the mic.
[160.54 --> 162.54]  So if I turn this down...
[162.54 --> 165.54]  Apparently it's still there.
[165.54 --> 166.54]  Oh.
[166.54 --> 167.54]  Wait.
[167.54 --> 168.54]  No.
[168.54 --> 169.54]  I have an idea.
[169.54 --> 170.54]  How about now?
[170.54 --> 171.54]  Are we good?
[171.54 --> 173.54]  I bet we're good.
[173.54 --> 174.54]  I think we're good.
[174.54 --> 177.54]  Because we shouldn't actually be using the microphone in.
[177.54 --> 178.54]  Yeah.
[178.54 --> 179.54]  Because he was saying the echo is ahead of you.
[179.54 --> 180.54]  Yeah.
[180.54 --> 181.54]  So it was pulling from...
[181.54 --> 182.54]  Oh.
[182.54 --> 183.54]  Okay.
[183.54 --> 184.54]  Alright.
[184.54 --> 185.54]  Alright.
[185.54 --> 186.54]  We're good.
[186.54 --> 188.54]  So do we try the comms thing first or should we play games first?
[188.54 --> 189.54]  I think we should try the comms thing first.
[189.54 --> 190.54]  Let's try the comms thing first.
[190.54 --> 191.54]  Alright.
[191.54 --> 192.54]  So...
[192.54 --> 193.54]  I guess we just pick up?
[193.54 --> 194.54]  How do we do it?
[194.54 --> 195.54]  I think we just pick up.
[195.54 --> 196.54]  Okay.
[196.54 --> 197.54]  So we pick up.
[197.54 --> 198.54]  Bleep bleep bleep.
[198.54 --> 199.54]  Can you hear them?
[199.54 --> 200.54]  Can they hear us?
[200.54 --> 201.54]  Hello?
[201.54 --> 202.54]  I can't hear them.
[202.54 --> 203.54]  Can't hear them.
[203.54 --> 204.54]  They are talking.
[204.54 --> 205.54]  They're talking.
[205.54 --> 206.54]  Hmm.
[206.54 --> 207.54]  You can hear other stuff through the computer though, right?
[207.54 --> 208.54]  Yeah.
[208.54 --> 209.54]  I can't hear them.
[209.54 --> 210.54]  Can't hear them.
[210.54 --> 211.54]  They are talking.
[211.54 --> 212.54]  They're talking.
[212.54 --> 213.54]  Hmm.
[213.54 --> 216.54]  You can hear other stuff through the computer though, right?
[216.54 --> 217.54]  Yeah.
[217.54 --> 220.54]  I can hear everything else through the computer.
[220.54 --> 222.54]  Speakers, Blackmagic audio.
[222.54 --> 223.54]  There's the problem.
[223.54 --> 224.54]  So speakers...
[224.54 --> 226.54]  Whoa, hi everyone.
[226.54 --> 227.54]  Speakers...
[227.54 --> 228.54]  Whoa, hi everyone.
[228.54 --> 230.54]  Okay, hey guys.
[230.54 --> 233.54]  When you're talking to us, turn down your speakers, eh?
[233.54 --> 235.54]  When you're talking to us, turn down your speakers, eh?
[235.54 --> 236.54]  Oh.
[236.54 --> 239.54]  Mute the stream, please.
[239.54 --> 241.54]  Mute the stream, please.
[241.54 --> 243.54]  Mute the stream, please.
[243.54 --> 244.54]  Ow.
[244.54 --> 245.54]  Okay.
[245.54 --> 246.54]  So that...
[246.54 --> 247.54]  That is why...
[247.54 --> 256.54]  That is why radio shows have people mute the stream when stuff happens.
[256.54 --> 261.54]  Okay, so guys, please tell me you're wearing headphones now.
[261.54 --> 262.54]  Yeah.
[262.54 --> 263.54]  Mute the stream.
[263.54 --> 264.54]  All right, there we go.
[264.54 --> 266.54]  I didn't even have the stream going, so...
[266.54 --> 267.54]  All right.
[267.54 --> 269.54]  I didn't even have the stream going, so...
[269.54 --> 270.54]  All right.
[270.54 --> 271.54]  I didn't even have the stream going, so...
[271.54 --> 274.54]  Someone's got speakers on, guys.
[274.54 --> 275.54]  No speakers.
[275.54 --> 276.54]  Someone's got speakers on, guys.
[276.54 --> 277.54]  No speakers.
[277.54 --> 282.54]  Who is it?
[282.54 --> 283.54]  Is it Whaler?
[283.54 --> 284.54]  It's Whaler.
[284.54 --> 285.54]  Whaler, dude.
[285.54 --> 287.54]  Okay, Winspeed.
[287.54 --> 290.54]  Let's see if everyone can hear you really well.
[290.54 --> 294.54]  I am on Australian internet, so that could be a problem.
[294.54 --> 295.54]  All right.
[295.54 --> 299.54]  Guys, can you hear our admin, Winspeed?
[299.54 --> 301.54]  Or, admin, moderator, moderator.
[301.54 --> 303.54]  I just gave you a promotion.
[303.54 --> 304.54]  Sweet.
[304.54 --> 306.54]  I'll be happy with that.
[306.54 --> 308.54]  All right.
[308.54 --> 309.54]  That's fantastic.
[309.54 --> 315.54]  So, everyone who's still watching the stream, this is how we plan to do it.
[315.54 --> 320.54]  We're going to have people be able to call in live and talk live on the show.
[320.54 --> 324.54]  We're actually going to have the moderation team handle patching people through.
[324.54 --> 325.54]  And...
[325.54 --> 326.54]  I knew that would happen.
[326.54 --> 327.54]  I haven't talked to them about that yet.
[327.54 --> 328.54]  Oh, really?
[328.54 --> 329.54]  Oh.
[329.54 --> 334.54]  I was going to ask if they didn't mind.
[334.54 --> 335.54]  Oh.
[335.54 --> 338.54]  Well, all right then.
[338.54 --> 341.54]  You guys cool with that?
[341.54 --> 342.54]  Yeah.
[342.54 --> 343.54]  I'm fine.
[343.54 --> 347.54]  I think Dim will be asleep for most of it.
[347.54 --> 349.54]  Dave's probably going to nod off, but I'm around, so...
[349.54 --> 350.54]  Fantastic.
[350.54 --> 351.54]  What did he say?
[351.54 --> 352.54]  He said, uh, should be fine.
[352.54 --> 353.54]  All right, cool.
[353.54 --> 354.54]  He says the others probably will be asleep.
[354.54 --> 355.54]  Yeah.
[355.54 --> 356.54]  But sleeping is for the week anyway.
[356.54 --> 357.54]  Uh, Dave usually comes on right about the time the after party starts.
[357.54 --> 358.54]  I see.
[358.54 --> 359.54]  Okay.
[359.54 --> 360.54]  Because he's...
[360.54 --> 361.54]  Yeah.
[361.54 --> 362.54]  Uh, okay.
[362.54 --> 363.54]  Well, let's, uh, why don't we get started?
[363.54 --> 364.54]  I insisted to slick...
[364.54 --> 365.54]  Anyway, okay, so that was it.
[365.54 --> 366.54]  That was our test.
[366.54 --> 367.54]  Okay.
[367.54 --> 368.54]  Okay.
[368.54 --> 369.54]  Okay.
[369.54 --> 370.54]  Okay.
[370.54 --> 371.54]  Okay.
[371.54 --> 374.54]  Well, let's, uh, why don't we get started?
[374.54 --> 376.54]  I insisted to slick...
[376.54 --> 377.54]  Anyway, okay, so that was it.
[377.54 --> 378.54]  That was our test.
[378.54 --> 379.54]  So that was it, right?
[379.54 --> 380.54]  We're good?
[380.54 --> 381.54]  I think so.
[381.54 --> 382.54]  Okay.
[382.54 --> 384.54]  Are we done with that then?
[384.54 --> 385.54]  Um, yeah.
[385.54 --> 386.54]  I think that's it.
[386.54 --> 388.54]  Let's play some Super Mario Brothers.
[388.54 --> 393.54]  I want to play battle mode because I like battle mode and I know that slick isn't good
[393.54 --> 394.54]  at it.
[394.54 --> 396.54]  Because I've never played it once.
[396.54 --> 397.54]  You've never played battle mode?
[397.54 --> 398.54]  Never.
[398.54 --> 400.54]  Oh, battle mode is awesome.
[400.54 --> 403.54]  I know what you do because I've seen it, but I've never played it.
[403.54 --> 407.54]  Oh, that is, uh, that is very encouraging indeed.
[407.54 --> 409.54]  Someone's like, you guys lost 2,000 people.
[409.54 --> 411.54]  Yeah, we were, we were kind of expecting that.
[411.54 --> 414.54]  We're going for a long time and the after party is not as popular.
[414.54 --> 415.54]  Yeah.
[415.54 --> 419.54]  The after party is way, way less popular than the other.
[419.54 --> 422.54]  The large part of the reason that we do after parties is so that we can play video games.
[422.54 --> 423.54]  Yeah.
[423.54 --> 424.54]  Okay.
[424.54 --> 425.54]  So five games to win.
[425.54 --> 426.54]  Round one.
[426.54 --> 427.54]  Here we go.
[427.54 --> 428.54]  Bring it on.
[428.54 --> 429.54]  Okay.
[429.54 --> 430.54]  Well, that's pretty rude.
[430.54 --> 431.54]  There we go.
[431.54 --> 432.54]  Go away.
[432.54 --> 433.54]  Okay.
[433.54 --> 435.54]  You're going to be like that.
[435.54 --> 437.54]  You're going to be like that about it.
[437.54 --> 438.54]  That's fine.
[438.54 --> 439.54]  Bring it on, Hoser.
[439.54 --> 441.54]  I didn't know that was a thing, man.
[441.54 --> 444.54]  So is it first person to get like a whole bunch of coins or?
[444.54 --> 445.54]  Uh, yeah.
[445.54 --> 446.54]  You want to get coins.
[446.54 --> 447.54]  Coins are good.
[447.54 --> 448.54]  Yeah.
[448.54 --> 449.54]  Oh crap.
[449.54 --> 453.54]  I just thought it was more, or like if you die, what happens?
[453.54 --> 454.54]  Mushrooms are good.
[454.54 --> 456.54]  Oh wow.
[456.54 --> 458.54]  This is not going well.
[458.54 --> 459.54]  Um.
[459.54 --> 461.54]  Someone says the webcam screen is too big.
[461.54 --> 462.54]  Did I break it?
[462.54 --> 463.54]  Did I break it?
[463.54 --> 465.54]  No, you didn't break anything.
[465.54 --> 466.54]  You won.
[466.54 --> 468.54]  Have you ever seen Grandma's Boy?
[468.54 --> 469.54]  What?
[469.54 --> 470.54]  You haven't seen Grandma's Boy?
[470.54 --> 471.54]  No.
[471.54 --> 472.54]  Wow.
[472.54 --> 473.54]  That's a good movie.
[473.54 --> 476.54]  Hey, why don't you just cut it out?
[476.54 --> 481.54]  Well, oh you can go through the side.
[481.54 --> 482.54]  Yeah.
[482.54 --> 483.54]  That's cool.
[483.54 --> 484.54]  Boom.
[484.54 --> 485.54]  One coin.
[485.54 --> 487.54]  Are you just going to camp the coin spawn?
[487.54 --> 488.54]  Yeah, I'm going to camp.
[488.54 --> 489.54]  Well, they don't spawn.
[489.54 --> 492.54]  You have to kill a dude to make the coins.
[492.54 --> 493.54]  Oh.
[493.54 --> 495.54]  Oh crap.
[495.54 --> 497.54]  Oh, wow.
[497.54 --> 500.54]  This is not a good thing.
[500.54 --> 505.54]  I'm going to just hang here.
[505.54 --> 509.54]  So you're going to be like that about it, eh?
[509.54 --> 511.54]  I don't even know what I'm doing.
[511.54 --> 512.54]  What do you mean you're going to be like that?
[512.54 --> 513.54]  I'm just running around.
[513.54 --> 516.54]  Okay, basically you want coins.
[516.54 --> 517.54]  You don't want to get hit by dudes.
[517.54 --> 519.54]  Oh, I thought I was going to go through the pipe.
[519.54 --> 520.54]  Okay.
[520.54 --> 526.54]  Okay, so all the ways that the other guy can die is you can get five coins first or the other
[526.54 --> 528.54]  guy can die.
[528.54 --> 532.54]  And then the other way to die is to something.
[532.54 --> 533.54]  I'm busy.
[533.54 --> 534.54]  I'm busy.
[534.54 --> 535.54]  Ah, there we go.
[535.54 --> 536.54]  Okay, I'm just going to steal that damn mushroom.
[536.54 --> 537.54]  Oh no!
[537.54 --> 540.54]  And the mushroom was too little too late.
[540.54 --> 541.54]  Okay, I'm out of here.
[541.54 --> 542.54]  Whoa, go away.
[542.54 --> 543.54]  Oh, it's a fast duck.
[543.54 --> 544.54]  Oh, I'm dead.
[544.54 --> 545.54]  Okay, so why don't we have a look at the Twitch chat and see if they have anything to talk
[545.54 --> 546.54]  about.
[546.54 --> 547.54]  Hey guys.
[547.54 --> 549.54]  Would I be able to ask a short and fast question about hardware related stuff?
[549.54 --> 553.54]  Well, you certainly could have and I would have to go through the chat.
[553.54 --> 554.54]  Okay, I'm out of here.
[554.54 --> 555.54]  Oh, I'm dead.
[555.54 --> 556.54]  Okay, I'm out of here.
[556.54 --> 557.54]  Oh, go away.
[557.54 --> 559.54]  Oh, it's a fast duck.
[559.54 --> 560.54]  Oh, I'm dead.
[560.54 --> 570.54]  Okay, so why don't we have a look at the Twitch chat and see if they have anything to talk
[570.54 --> 571.54]  about.
[571.54 --> 572.54]  Hey guys.
[572.54 --> 575.54]  Would I be able to ask a short and fast question about hardware related stuff?
[575.54 --> 578.54]  You certainly could have and I would have read it if you'd done it for that message.
[578.54 --> 582.54]  Should I get a Fractal Design Define R4 or the Arc MIDI?
[582.54 --> 583.54]  You know what?
[583.54 --> 589.54]  Either of them are very legitimate choices and I would personally probably go for the Define
[589.54 --> 593.54]  R4 just because I really like the Define R4.
[593.54 --> 594.54]  Or an Arc MIDI?
[594.54 --> 596.54]  Yeah, Arc MIDI is a good choice too though.
[596.54 --> 597.54]  It is.
[597.54 --> 601.54]  One thing I would do is just check out how many builds on the build log section are in
[601.54 --> 603.54]  R4s to know how much people like R4s.
[603.54 --> 604.54]  Yeah, like all of them.
[604.54 --> 605.54]  What?
[605.54 --> 606.54]  What just happened?
[606.54 --> 607.54]  Oh, the touch pad.
[607.54 --> 608.54]  Oh, that's...
[608.54 --> 611.54]  That's okay, we can still play on the ring.
[611.54 --> 612.54]  I jumped it!
[612.54 --> 613.54]  Yes!
[613.54 --> 618.54]  I thought I might have jumped it but I wasn't entirely sure.
[618.54 --> 619.54]  Go away.
[619.54 --> 620.54]  Oh, I didn't see the ghost.
[620.54 --> 621.54]  Oh, I didn't see the ghost.
[621.54 --> 622.54]  Yeah, that's right.
[622.54 --> 623.54]  Bring it.
[623.54 --> 625.54]  Oh, bring on my coins.
[625.54 --> 626.54]  Oh, bring on my coins!
[626.54 --> 627.54]  Thank you for the coins!
[627.54 --> 628.54]  Boom!
[628.54 --> 629.54]  Uh...
[629.54 --> 634.54]  Can you play Super Mario Kart Multiplayer on SNES?
[634.54 --> 635.54]  Yeah, we should totally do that.
[635.54 --> 636.54]  Hi, Shane!
[636.54 --> 639.54]  Why hasn't Slick fired the short guy yet?
[639.54 --> 640.54]  The short guy?
[640.54 --> 641.54]  Uh, I...
[641.54 --> 642.54]  He works for me.
[642.54 --> 643.54]  Linus is short.
[643.54 --> 644.54]  Not the other way around.
[644.54 --> 645.54]  Just saying.
[645.54 --> 646.54]  Oh, he's...
[646.54 --> 648.54]  I thought he might have been referencing someone else.
[648.54 --> 649.54]  Are you gonna camp that?
[649.54 --> 650.54]  Yeah, I'm gonna camp that.
[650.54 --> 651.54]  That's how I roll.
[651.54 --> 652.54]  Wow!
[652.54 --> 654.54]  You called me lame for doing that and then you go and do it.
[654.54 --> 655.54]  Just like...
[655.54 --> 656.54]  Just like...
[656.54 --> 657.54]  Just like...
[657.54 --> 658.54]  That.
[658.54 --> 659.54]  That is how it's done, folks.
[659.54 --> 660.54]  What a hypocrite!
[660.54 --> 661.54]  That's not fun.
[661.54 --> 662.54]  Oh, crap.
[662.54 --> 663.54]  Forgot what those ones did.
[663.54 --> 664.54]  Oh, no!
[664.54 --> 665.54]  Whoa.
[665.54 --> 666.54]  It's been a while.
[666.54 --> 669.54]  People are like, that controller sounds like a crisp packet.
[669.54 --> 670.54]  A lot of these ones do.
[670.54 --> 672.54]  And I think by crisp they mean potato chip.
[672.54 --> 673.54]  But they're from one of those...
[673.54 --> 674.54]  A lot of these ones do.
[674.54 --> 676.54]  One of those parts of the world where they call them crisps.
[676.54 --> 677.54]  That's a shame.
[677.54 --> 682.54]  Yeah, I guess it probably does.
[682.54 --> 685.54]  These are real SNES controllers that we're using now.
[685.54 --> 690.54]  We got an adapter on Amazon that is actually, like, pretty balling.
[690.54 --> 692.54]  And we're pretty happy with it.
[692.54 --> 695.54]  Pretty happy to be using a proper SNES controller.
[695.54 --> 697.54]  Yeah, you could just not do that.
[697.54 --> 699.54]  That would be kinda cool.
[699.54 --> 700.54]  That would be kinda cool.
[700.54 --> 701.54]  Wow, what just happened there?
[701.54 --> 702.54]  That was bizarre.
[702.54 --> 704.54]  That shell just hardcore hit me.
[704.54 --> 706.54]  Yeah, and then came down and hit me.
[706.54 --> 707.54]  And actually hit me.
[707.54 --> 708.54]  That was awesome.
[708.54 --> 710.54]  That was awesome and I loved it.
[710.54 --> 711.54]  Totally not awesome.
[711.54 --> 712.54]  Oh no, the ghost.
[712.54 --> 713.54]  The ghost?
[713.54 --> 715.54]  Yeah, the ghost.
[715.54 --> 716.54]  The ghost.
[716.54 --> 717.54]  The ghost.
[717.54 --> 718.54]  The ghost.
[718.54 --> 719.54]  Okay, we have a problem.
[719.54 --> 721.54]  And I'm gonna solve it with a duck.
[721.54 --> 722.54]  Okay.
[722.54 --> 725.54]  I wasn't sure where that was gonna go.
[725.54 --> 728.54]  I basically just watched it the whole time.
[728.54 --> 729.54]  Ah, no.
[729.54 --> 730.54]  There's my coin.
[730.54 --> 731.54]  Where's my coin?
[731.54 --> 732.54]  There's my...
[732.54 --> 733.54]  Oh no!
[733.54 --> 736.54]  No, I was right there.
[736.54 --> 742.54]  Someone asks if I've used PrimoChill SysPrep on a system yet.
[742.54 --> 743.54]  The answer is no.
[743.54 --> 749.54]  I actually just got my first pack of PrimoFax LRT that has SysPrep and I am not gonna use
[749.54 --> 750.54]  it.
[750.54 --> 755.54]  Because I already know and trust LRT on its own.
[755.54 --> 760.54]  So, I tend not to change things that aren't broken because I'm old fashioned like that.
[760.54 --> 762.54]  So, yeah.
[762.54 --> 763.54]  Boom!
[763.54 --> 765.54]  Two coins!
[765.54 --> 766.54]  Boom!
[766.54 --> 767.54]  Three coins!
[767.54 --> 768.54]  Go away!
[768.54 --> 769.54]  Go away!
[769.54 --> 770.54]  Yeah, that's right.
[770.54 --> 771.54]  I got it.
[771.54 --> 772.54]  Oh no, I'm dead.
[772.54 --> 774.54]  Oh, now I'm really dead.
[774.54 --> 775.54]  No, that's you.
[775.54 --> 776.54]  Oh crap!
[776.54 --> 777.54]  Wow!
[777.54 --> 778.54]  I'm actually losing hardcore!
[778.54 --> 779.54]  I think you just lost actually.
[779.54 --> 780.54]  I think I actually did just lose.
[780.54 --> 781.54]  Okay.
[781.54 --> 782.54]  I'm gonna lose.
[782.54 --> 783.54]  I'm gonna lose.
[783.54 --> 784.54]  I think I actually did just lose.
[784.54 --> 786.54]  Okay, well you get one star for that.
[786.54 --> 787.54]  Apparently.
[787.54 --> 788.54]  Alright.
[788.54 --> 789.54]  Bring it on.
[789.54 --> 791.54]  I'm gonna win this next one.
[791.54 --> 792.54]  Okay.
[792.54 --> 795.54]  Uh, someone asked what headphones are those.
[795.54 --> 799.54]  Uh, honestly they aren't really that special so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[799.54 --> 802.54]  But they're the Tekken Motion something or other.
[802.54 --> 804.54]  Like, uh, what are they?
[804.54 --> 806.54]  Like dubstep optimized headphones or something?
[806.54 --> 807.54]  Something weird like that.
[807.54 --> 808.54]  Yeah.
[808.54 --> 810.54]  They're DJ headphones of some sort.
[810.54 --> 811.54]  Hey!
[811.54 --> 812.54]  Hey!
[812.54 --> 813.54]  Cut it out!
[813.54 --> 814.54]  Ha ha!
[814.54 --> 815.54]  You got nothing.
[815.54 --> 816.54]  You got nothing.
[816.54 --> 817.54]  What?
[817.54 --> 818.54]  Except for a star.
[818.54 --> 819.54]  No results.
[819.54 --> 820.54]  I heard that counts for something.
[820.54 --> 821.54]  A star?
[821.54 --> 822.54]  Yeah.
[822.54 --> 823.54]  Oh, well, no.
[823.54 --> 824.54]  Those don't count for anything.
[824.54 --> 825.54]  That's actually all.
[825.54 --> 827.54]  Oh, come on!
[827.54 --> 829.54]  Why can't I do this?
[829.54 --> 830.54]  What is that?
[830.54 --> 832.54]  Whoa, it's a ghost!
[832.54 --> 833.54]  Ha ha ha!
[833.54 --> 838.54]  I saw it like spinning on the tube and I was like, what the heck does that do?
[838.54 --> 839.54]  At least I know what ghosts do.
[839.54 --> 840.54]  They haunt things.
[840.54 --> 841.54]  Yeah, but it's-
[841.54 --> 842.54]  It's not exactly a secret deal.
[842.54 --> 844.54]  No, it doesn't start as a ghost.
[844.54 --> 845.54]  Mushroom!
[845.54 --> 847.54]  It doesn't start as a ghost.
[847.54 --> 849.54]  It starts as like this little spinning wisp thing.
[849.54 --> 853.54]  Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger,
[853.54 --> 859.54]  badger, badger, mushroom, a badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger.
[859.54 --> 860.54]  Someone's like, shut up.
[860.54 --> 863.54]  Snake, it's a snake.
[863.54 --> 864.54]  What's that?
[864.54 --> 865.54]  That's the same song.
[865.54 --> 866.54]  No, it isn't.
[866.54 --> 867.54]  Yes, it is.
[867.54 --> 869.54]  How is that the same song?
[869.54 --> 870.54]  Wow.
[870.54 --> 873.54]  Oh, later in the song.
[873.54 --> 874.54]  Yes.
[874.54 --> 875.54]  Yeah, you're right.
[875.54 --> 880.54]  Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[880.54 --> 884.54]  Well, I only like the badger, mushroom part, so there, whatever.
[884.54 --> 887.54]  Me too, to be honest, but it's still part of the song.
[887.54 --> 890.54]  Oh, okay, well, you can have that one.
[890.54 --> 891.54]  No!
[891.54 --> 892.54]  Is that your first coin?
[892.54 --> 893.54]  Like, honestly?
[893.54 --> 894.54]  No.
[894.54 --> 895.54]  Honestly, no.
[895.54 --> 896.54]  See?
[896.54 --> 897.54]  No, no, it's not.
[897.54 --> 898.54]  What, the ghosts?
[898.54 --> 899.54]  Yeah, they start as a twirling thing.
[899.54 --> 900.54]  I know what they do!
[900.54 --> 904.54]  I mean, I forgot some things, with my old age.
[904.54 --> 905.54]  Like, snake.
[905.54 --> 907.54]  Like, well, yeah, I like that.
[907.54 --> 908.54]  Go away.
[908.54 --> 909.54]  Go away.
[909.54 --> 910.54]  Go away!
[910.54 --> 914.54]  Nope, not interested in dealing with you right now.
[914.54 --> 915.54]  Oh, okay.
[915.54 --> 917.54]  I see how it's gonna be.
[917.54 --> 920.54]  Alright, yeah, oh, boom.
[920.54 --> 921.54]  Yes!
[921.54 --> 922.54]  Oh, you got it!
[922.54 --> 923.54]  Okay.
[923.54 --> 925.54]  Battle mode is so awesome.
[925.54 --> 928.54]  I forgot in this game you can't pick up turtles.
[928.54 --> 930.54]  Yeah, you just kick them.
[930.54 --> 932.54]  That is, oh, crap.
[932.54 --> 934.54]  I've already had problems with that, actually.
[934.54 --> 935.54]  Oh!
[935.54 --> 937.54]  Trying to grab it and pick it up and throw it at you,
[937.54 --> 939.54]  I've done that, like, three times and just kicked it.
[939.54 --> 940.54]  And I'm like, dang.
[940.54 --> 941.54]  Someone says, Linus, shut up.
[941.54 --> 942.54]  Okay, you talk then.
[942.54 --> 943.54]  Uh...
[943.54 --> 945.54]  Maybe if Slick actually had the Twitch chat open,
[945.54 --> 946.54]  he could answer some questions.
[946.54 --> 947.54]  Cause I'm...
[947.54 --> 948.54]  Ugh.
[948.54 --> 949.54]  Cause you just are...
[949.54 --> 950.54]  See?
[950.54 --> 951.54]  That's why I'm losing.
[951.54 --> 953.54]  Cause you're putting all your focus on the game,
[953.54 --> 955.54]  and I'm actually trying to pay attention to the audience.
[955.54 --> 958.54]  That, by the way, sustains us in a big way.
[958.54 --> 959.54]  Oh, my.
[959.54 --> 961.54]  If we didn't have the audience, we'd be nothing,
[961.54 --> 962.54]  but you just don't have a proper...
[962.54 --> 963.54]  Oh, my.
[963.54 --> 964.54]  ...healthy respect for the audience, Dad.
[964.54 --> 965.54]  Not at all.
[965.54 --> 967.54]  That is what I think the problem...
[967.54 --> 968.54]  I know, not at all.
[968.54 --> 969.54]  That's exactly what I said.
[969.54 --> 971.54]  I was monitoring our mods who was helping with the comms chat,
[971.54 --> 973.54]  and then after monitoring our mods,
[973.54 --> 976.54]  I was talking to one of the IRS team members who wanted to check in.
[976.54 --> 979.54]  So what, if you're not monitoring people and like being a bossy pants,
[979.54 --> 982.54]  then you don't like do it, and it's not worthwhile?
[982.54 --> 983.54]  What?
[983.54 --> 984.54]  I see how it's gonna be.
[984.54 --> 985.54]  Don't even...
[985.54 --> 986.54]  Oh, I missed it.
[986.54 --> 987.54]  Oh, I'm...
[987.54 --> 989.54]  They went through the two...
[989.54 --> 990.54]  Okay, I just...
[990.54 --> 993.54]  I should stay focused on the game as much should actually happen right now.
[997.54 --> 998.54]  Ohhhh.
[998.54 --> 1001.54]  I'm gonna try and tune in, Twitch chat.
[1001.54 --> 1002.54]  Hmm.
[1002.54 --> 1006.54]  Someone's asking about new 990FX boards.
[1006.54 --> 1007.54]  I'm not aware of any.
[1008.54 --> 1011.54]  Like, what would be a new 90FX board that you can think of?
[1011.54 --> 1012.54]  I don't...
[1012.54 --> 1013.54]  I don't know.
[1013.54 --> 1014.54]  I'm not aware of any.
[1014.54 --> 1015.54]  Can you troll that a little less?
[1015.54 --> 1016.54]  Troll what?
[1016.54 --> 1018.54]  Like, can you actually be less annoying, please?
[1018.54 --> 1019.54]  About what?
[1019.54 --> 1020.54]  About everything.
[1020.54 --> 1024.54]  Maybe if you were just less annoying in general, people would like you more.
[1024.54 --> 1025.54]  Wow!
[1027.54 --> 1029.54]  Oh, I thought I could jump on his head.
[1029.54 --> 1030.54]  Nope, not that one.
[1030.54 --> 1032.54]  Nope, is the blue one not like that?
[1032.54 --> 1034.54]  I don't think you can jump on the other ones either.
[1034.54 --> 1037.54]  I think contact is death with any of this stuff.
[1037.54 --> 1038.54]  You have to bop them from below.
[1038.54 --> 1039.54]  Hmm.
[1039.54 --> 1040.54]  Okay.
[1040.54 --> 1041.54]  You have to...
[1041.54 --> 1043.54]  You have to be on the bottom.
[1043.54 --> 1044.54]  Oh, I ghost.
[1044.54 --> 1045.54]  Whaaa!
[1045.54 --> 1046.54]  No.
[1046.54 --> 1047.54]  Thank you.
[1047.54 --> 1048.54]  Thank you.
[1048.54 --> 1051.54]  Someone says what's up with the audio.
[1051.54 --> 1052.54]  Oh, can you turn off your stick?
[1052.54 --> 1053.54]  Yeah, I'm doing that right now.
[1053.54 --> 1054.54]  Okay.
[1054.54 --> 1055.54]  I'll go win while you're doing that.
[1055.54 --> 1056.54]  That's cool.
[1056.54 --> 1057.54]  That'd be pretty cool.
[1057.54 --> 1060.54]  So, um, we've been thinking for a little bit.
[1060.54 --> 1061.54]  I mean, one thing that we've actually...
[1061.54 --> 1065.54]  We talked about this a little bit, I think, in the context of the Noctua discussion last
[1065.54 --> 1066.54]  week.
[1066.54 --> 1071.54]  But we've wanted for a little while to do like a section of the forum almost, or like a post
[1071.54 --> 1079.54]  on, um, on like particular sub-forums where we actually talk a fair bit about the hardware
[1079.54 --> 1081.54]  products that we like best.
[1081.54 --> 1086.54]  And we were thinking we'll call it like Linus' likes and Slick's deals or something like
[1086.54 --> 1087.54]  that.
[1087.54 --> 1090.54]  Would you guys like to see posts in the forum where we really talk about the hardware that
[1090.54 --> 1091.54]  we like best?
[1091.54 --> 1095.54]  Because the problem with it is a lot of the time it won't be very... it won't be very objective,
[1095.54 --> 1096.54]  for one thing.
[1096.54 --> 1099.54]  Because sometimes the things we like are just...
[1099.54 --> 1100.54]  Because we like them.
[1100.54 --> 1102.54]  Yeah, it's not always...
[1102.54 --> 1104.54]  Or something that's very opinion based.
[1104.54 --> 1105.54]  Yeah.
[1105.54 --> 1106.54]  Boom.
[1106.54 --> 1107.54]  Oh!
[1107.54 --> 1108.54]  You were...
[1108.54 --> 1110.54]  Okay, I lucked out there.
[1110.54 --> 1112.54]  You were so lucky right there.
[1112.54 --> 1114.54]  People are saying yes, they would like that.
[1114.54 --> 1115.54]  Um...
[1115.54 --> 1116.54]  So, okay.
[1116.54 --> 1117.54]  But how would...
[1117.54 --> 1118.54]  Okay.
[1118.54 --> 1121.54]  The main problem is how we're gonna implement it.
[1121.54 --> 1124.54]  And we don't want it to... we don't want it to be something that like vendors are paying
[1124.54 --> 1125.54]  us for.
[1125.54 --> 1127.54]  We want it to be something that's really genuine.
[1127.54 --> 1131.54]  But the problem is we're gonna end up with a lot of like discontinued stuff that you can't
[1131.54 --> 1132.54]  buy.
[1132.54 --> 1134.54]  Or we're gonna end up with like...
[1134.54 --> 1136.54]  Like we're gonna end up with a lot of stupid stuff on the list.
[1136.54 --> 1137.54]  That's the issue.
[1137.54 --> 1140.54]  And so that's our concern about it right now.
[1142.54 --> 1143.54]  Go away, go away.
[1144.54 --> 1145.54]  Go away, go away.
[1145.54 --> 1146.54]  Boom!
[1146.54 --> 1147.54]  One coin!
[1147.54 --> 1148.54]  Two coins!
[1148.54 --> 1149.54]  That's right.
[1149.54 --> 1152.54]  That is how it is done, good sir.
[1152.54 --> 1154.54]  Have you won with coins in this?
[1154.54 --> 1155.54]  If I... yeah.
[1155.54 --> 1156.54]  I think once.
[1156.54 --> 1157.54]  I have won with coins.
[1157.54 --> 1158.54]  Once?
[1158.54 --> 1159.54]  What was the question?
[1159.54 --> 1161.54]  The question was, have you won with coins?
[1161.54 --> 1162.54]  The answer was yes.
[1162.54 --> 1163.54]  True.
[1163.54 --> 1166.54]  That was the question, and that was the...
[1166.54 --> 1167.54]  Oh!
[1167.54 --> 1168.54]  Shoot.
[1168.54 --> 1169.54]  Thank you!
[1169.54 --> 1171.54]  Okay, I'm good.
[1171.54 --> 1172.54]  Okay.
[1172.54 --> 1174.54]  Coins are good.
[1174.54 --> 1175.54]  Whoops.
[1175.54 --> 1176.54]  Okay.
[1176.54 --> 1178.54]  Well, I'm just gonna show over here.
[1178.54 --> 1179.54]  Okay, we gotta...
[1179.54 --> 1180.54]  What's going on up there in the top left?
[1180.54 --> 1182.54]  I don't know, a bit of a ton of a ton of a ton of a ton of a ton of a ton of a ton of
[1182.54 --> 1183.54]  things going on there.
[1183.54 --> 1184.54]  No.
[1184.54 --> 1185.54]  Alright, here we go.
[1185.54 --> 1186.54]  Time for some slick style trolling.
[1186.54 --> 1187.54]  Boom!
[1187.54 --> 1188.54]  Go away.
[1188.54 --> 1189.54]  Boom!
[1189.54 --> 1190.54]  Go away!
[1190.54 --> 1191.54]  Okay.
[1191.54 --> 1192.54]  Got that guy.
[1192.54 --> 1193.54]  Whoa!
[1193.54 --> 1194.54]  Hello!
[1194.54 --> 1195.54]  Oh, shoot!
[1195.54 --> 1196.54]  Nice!
[1196.54 --> 1197.54]  Oh!
[1197.54 --> 1198.54]  Oh!
[1198.54 --> 1199.54]  Oh!
[1199.54 --> 1200.54]  Oh!
[1200.54 --> 1201.54]  Oh!
[1201.54 --> 1202.54]  Oh!
[1202.54 --> 1203.54]  Oh!
[1203.54 --> 1204.54]  Oh!
[1204.54 --> 1205.54]  Oh!
[1205.54 --> 1206.54]  Oh!
[1206.54 --> 1207.54]  Oh!
[1207.54 --> 1208.54]  Oh!
[1208.54 --> 1209.54]  Oh!
[1209.54 --> 1210.54]  Oh!
[1210.54 --> 1211.54]  Nice!
[1211.54 --> 1212.54]  Oh!
[1212.54 --> 1213.54]  Nice jump!
[1213.54 --> 1215.54]  I still think that you can hit their heads.
[1215.54 --> 1216.54]  That's why I keep screwing up.
[1216.54 --> 1219.54]  K10Beaster says, I've had the worst day ever.
[1219.54 --> 1221.54]  That's unfortunate.
[1221.54 --> 1222.54]  What's the hissing?
[1222.54 --> 1223.54]  Is Skype still...
[1223.54 --> 1224.54]  Is comms still on?
[1224.54 --> 1226.54]  Can we just turn comms off?
[1226.54 --> 1227.54]  Yeah.
[1227.54 --> 1228.54]  Yeah, we should just...
[1228.54 --> 1229.54]  Probably these guys.
[1229.54 --> 1230.54]  So we gotta make sure...
[1230.54 --> 1231.54]  You know what?
[1231.54 --> 1232.54]  People are just gonna get...
[1232.54 --> 1233.54]  No, no, no.
[1233.54 --> 1234.54]  Here.
[1234.54 --> 1235.54]  Just...
[1235.54 --> 1236.54]  Just...
[1236.54 --> 1237.54]  Sure.
[1237.54 --> 1238.54]  People are just going to get kicked from calling in.
[1238.54 --> 1239.54]  If you don't have a good mic.
[1239.54 --> 1240.54]  And your setup isn't...
[1240.54 --> 1241.54]  Your hardcore gonna get...
[1241.54 --> 1242.54]  Your hardcore just gonna get kicked.
[1242.54 --> 1243.54]  Like, right away.
[1243.54 --> 1245.54]  Like, we can't have everyone listening to your static.
[1245.54 --> 1248.54]  If your audio quality isn't good, it just...
[1248.54 --> 1250.54]  Yeah, it's just not gonna happen.
[1250.54 --> 1251.54]  Can you...
[1251.54 --> 1253.54]  Can you not bother me, please?
[1253.54 --> 1254.54]  Oh!
[1254.54 --> 1255.54]  Shoot.
[1255.54 --> 1256.54]  So, there.
[1256.54 --> 1257.54]  Are we good?
[1257.54 --> 1258.54]  Uh, yeah.
[1258.54 --> 1261.54]  Calling in will not be done, uh, yet.
[1261.54 --> 1264.54]  It will be done, uh, next week.
[1264.54 --> 1266.54]  So we are really excited about it.
[1266.54 --> 1269.54]  We are gonna give full instructions on how to do it next week.
[1269.54 --> 1273.54]  When, uh, when such an option will actually be available.
[1273.54 --> 1274.54]  So, yes.
[1274.54 --> 1275.54]  Extremely exciting.
[1275.54 --> 1276.54]  We...
[1276.54 --> 1279.54]  We think it's gonna be really cool and really fun and interactive and all that stuff.
[1279.54 --> 1280.54]  So, yeah.
[1280.54 --> 1281.54]  Check it.
[1281.54 --> 1282.54]  Check it out.
[1282.54 --> 1286.54]  I need that coin and I didn't need that mushroom, but I took it.
[1286.54 --> 1287.54]  No!
[1287.54 --> 1288.54]  That's my roll.
[1288.54 --> 1290.54]  Thank you for the star.
[1290.54 --> 1291.54]  Linus...
[1291.54 --> 1292.54]  Digital Craver asks,
[1292.54 --> 1296.54]  Linus, any fans better than... or just as good as not to a fans?
[1296.54 --> 1298.54]  Not that I know of.
[1298.54 --> 1301.54]  Someone says, if we call in with comms, are we supposed to, like, ask about technology?
[1301.54 --> 1302.54]  Sure.
[1302.54 --> 1306.54]  Or we could do, like, calls about, uh, you know, given topics.
[1306.54 --> 1310.54]  I think we're probably gonna have a hard limit to how long a call can last because it's,
[1310.54 --> 1315.54]  um, like, on a lot of radio shows, the way that they tend to work is they just kinda
[1315.54 --> 1319.54]  cut people off and it's, it feels kinda mean sometimes.
[1319.54 --> 1320.54]  And I don't want it to...
[1320.54 --> 1323.54]  Oh, you piece of crap.
[1323.54 --> 1327.54]  Like, you actual piece of actual human garbage.
[1327.54 --> 1329.54]  You've done that to me!
[1329.54 --> 1331.54]  I can't believe you just did that to me.
[1331.54 --> 1332.54]  You've done that to me!
[1332.54 --> 1334.54]  Yeah, you're getting a pay cut.
[1334.54 --> 1335.54]  What?!
[1335.54 --> 1338.54]  This is what happens when you play video games with your boss.
[1338.54 --> 1339.54]  Oh!
[1340.54 --> 1341.54]  Shoot.
[1341.54 --> 1342.54]  Um...
[1343.54 --> 1346.54]  Someone asks, if I drive to you, will you sign my side...
[1346.54 --> 1349.54]  We don't really sign things.
[1349.54 --> 1356.54]  Like, you could ask, like, Tom Cruise for a signature when you visit him at the crazy house.
[1356.54 --> 1360.54]  Like, real celebrities give autographs.
[1360.54 --> 1363.54]  Like, it's not really a thing that we do.
[1363.54 --> 1364.54]  Uh, oh yes, mushroom.
[1364.54 --> 1365.54]  Very nice.
[1365.54 --> 1367.54]  So, I mean...
[1367.54 --> 1368.54]  Whoa!
[1368.54 --> 1369.54]  Yeah, it's not...
[1369.54 --> 1372.54]  Like, part of the reason why we're telling people, sort of, I feel like we're trying to
[1372.54 --> 1375.54]  tell them kinda politely, no, we don't really do that.
[1375.54 --> 1381.54]  Part of the reason for that is just that, like, it feels kinda weird to be, like, signing stuff.
[1381.54 --> 1382.54]  Thank you!
[1382.54 --> 1383.54]  Wow, perfect timing.
[1383.54 --> 1384.54]  I appreciated that.
[1384.54 --> 1387.54]  That was actually kinda cool.
[1387.54 --> 1391.54]  You're good at dodging the, uh, the shells there.
[1391.54 --> 1392.54]  Oh, shoot.
[1392.54 --> 1393.54]  No!
[1393.54 --> 1394.54]  Thank you!
[1394.54 --> 1395.54]  See?
[1395.54 --> 1396.54]  You just did it to me!
[1396.54 --> 1397.54]  Boom!
[1397.54 --> 1398.54]  Boom!
[1398.54 --> 1399.54]  Yeah, you're done.
[1399.54 --> 1400.54]  You're done.
[1400.54 --> 1401.54]  You're done.
[1401.54 --> 1402.54]  Uh, someone wants us to sell merchandise.
[1402.54 --> 1405.54]  I mean, the problem with selling merchandise is that it's, um...
[1405.54 --> 1407.54]  Actually hard to do.
[1407.54 --> 1408.54]  Yeah!
[1408.54 --> 1412.54]  Not only do you have to design merchandise that isn't, like, only cool to people who actually
[1412.54 --> 1417.54]  watch Linus Tech Tips, which is, like, a pretty limited number of people.
[1417.54 --> 1423.54]  I mean, I love the fans and the people who watch the show and, like, that's all, like, super cool.
[1423.54 --> 1429.54]  But the cold hard truth, for me, is not that many people watch Linus Tech Tips.
[1429.54 --> 1431.54]  Oh, I like that one too crafted my shirt.
[1431.54 --> 1432.54]  That's so unfortunate.
[1432.54 --> 1434.54]  And, like, most people won't get much out of it.
[1434.54 --> 1438.54]  Unless we make shirts that are also just kinda cool.
[1438.54 --> 1439.54]  Oh.
[1439.54 --> 1441.54]  I hate you.
[1441.54 --> 1442.54]  Oh!
[1442.54 --> 1443.54]  Thank you.
[1443.54 --> 1446.54]  Uh, so it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be tough.
[1446.54 --> 1449.54]  Will you have to pay to call in or is it free?
[1449.54 --> 1451.54]  It is definitely free.
[1451.54 --> 1452.54]  $400.
[1452.54 --> 1453.54]  Um...
[1453.54 --> 1454.54]  Minus $400.
[1454.54 --> 1456.54]  Someone wants us to talk about Star Citizen.
[1456.54 --> 1460.54]  I mean, they have a Star Citizen stream right now that we're obviously not watching.
[1460.54 --> 1466.54]  So the latest Star Citizen news, we're not really up on it so much as if we were actually
[1466.54 --> 1469.54]  watching the stream like good Star Citizen fans would.
[1469.54 --> 1470.54]  Alright.
[1470.54 --> 1473.54]  Oh, oh no!
[1473.54 --> 1474.54]  Oh no!
[1474.54 --> 1475.54]  Oh no!
[1475.54 --> 1476.54]  Oh no!
[1476.54 --> 1477.54]  Oh no!
[1477.54 --> 1480.54]  I don't know what that is.
[1480.54 --> 1482.54]  Is that from something?
[1482.54 --> 1483.54]  Nope.
[1483.54 --> 1484.54]  Oh my.
[1484.54 --> 1486.54]  Would be, like, Captain Zulu.
[1486.54 --> 1487.54]  No!
[1487.54 --> 1489.54]  Oh crap, what's his name?
[1489.54 --> 1490.54]  Shoot.
[1490.54 --> 1491.54]  Oh!
[1491.54 --> 1492.54]  Awesome.
[1492.54 --> 1494.54]  Uh, shoot, what's his name?
[1494.54 --> 1495.54]  Captain Zulu?
[1495.54 --> 1496.54]  Captain Zulu?
[1496.54 --> 1497.54]  Captain Sulu.
[1497.54 --> 1498.54]  Sulu?
[1498.54 --> 1499.54]  From, uh, from Star Trek.
[1499.54 --> 1500.54]  The actor.
[1500.54 --> 1501.54]  Isn't it just...
[1501.54 --> 1502.54]  Oh, he...
[1502.54 --> 1503.54]  I don't know.
[1503.54 --> 1504.54]  I don't know actor names.
[1504.54 --> 1505.54]  Ah, someone's...
[1505.54 --> 1506.54]  Yeah, George Takei.
[1506.54 --> 1507.54]  Thank you.
[1507.54 --> 1508.54]  He's not just an actor.
[1508.54 --> 1509.54]  He's like a gay rights activist and stuff now.
[1509.54 --> 1510.54]  I don't know people's names.
[1510.54 --> 1511.54]  Yeah, okay, I know.
[1511.54 --> 1512.54]  I mean, come on.
[1512.54 --> 1513.54]  Like...
[1513.54 --> 1514.54]  Nope.
[1514.54 --> 1515.54]  Do you know who Mark Hamill is?
[1515.54 --> 1518.54]  If you say the person's name, I'll know who they are.
[1518.54 --> 1519.54]  Boom!
[1519.54 --> 1520.54]  You ask who somebody is.
[1520.54 --> 1522.54]  Laying the smack down.
[1522.54 --> 1523.54]  Stealing the...
[1523.54 --> 1524.54]  Oh, wow.
[1524.54 --> 1526.54]  Oh, you just got comboed right there.
[1526.54 --> 1528.54]  You didn't even intentionally do that.
[1528.54 --> 1529.54]  I was attacking you.
[1529.54 --> 1530.54]  No, I hit...
[1530.54 --> 1531.54]  And I bumped into you.
[1531.54 --> 1532.54]  No, I hit that whole thing at the end.
[1532.54 --> 1533.54]  Yeah.
[1533.54 --> 1535.54]  Oh no, but the shell and stealing the mushroom were both on purpose.
[1535.54 --> 1538.54]  Stealing the mushroom, you bounced off, went that way, and then the mushroom spawned out.
[1538.54 --> 1539.54]  No, no.
[1539.54 --> 1540.54]  I hardcore stole that mushroom.
[1540.54 --> 1541.54]  No, you had no idea.
[1541.54 --> 1542.54]  That was so intentional that you don't...
[1542.54 --> 1543.54]  No, it wasn't.
[1543.54 --> 1548.54]  You can't even begin to premeditate the kind of premeditation that that was.
[1548.54 --> 1549.54]  Pffft.
[1551.54 --> 1557.54]  Like, you'd have to meditate like a Buddhist in order to understand that kind of level of meditation.
[1560.54 --> 1561.54]  Boom!
[1561.54 --> 1562.54]  No, no.
[1562.54 --> 1563.54]  Boom!
[1563.54 --> 1564.54]  Go away.
[1565.54 --> 1567.54]  Oh, oh, oh, crab.
[1567.54 --> 1568.54]  Okay.
[1568.54 --> 1570.54]  Got some crab cakes going on here.
[1570.54 --> 1572.54]  Oh, thank you for killing yourself.
[1572.54 --> 1573.54]  That was premeditated too.
[1573.54 --> 1574.54]  Was it?
[1574.54 --> 1575.54]  Right there.
[1575.54 --> 1577.54]  Someone says, I am Buddhist.
[1577.54 --> 1579.54]  I don't mean to be offensive in any way.
[1579.54 --> 1581.54]  But just like meditation is like...
[1581.54 --> 1582.54]  Is it your meditation awesome then?
[1582.54 --> 1583.54]  My meditation?
[1583.54 --> 1586.54]  He's got like a meditation skill of 99 because he's Buddhist.
[1586.54 --> 1588.54]  99 might not be that high depending on the game.
[1588.54 --> 1590.54]  What game is it that maxes out at 255?
[1590.54 --> 1592.54]  I think Final Fantasy 6 does.
[1592.54 --> 1593.54]  Something.
[1593.54 --> 1594.54]  Oh, wow.
[1594.54 --> 1595.54]  Is that how it's gonna be?
[1595.54 --> 1596.54]  What?
[1596.54 --> 1597.54]  How did that not work?
[1597.54 --> 1598.54]  Because the game does not condone that kind of...
[1598.54 --> 1599.54]  Whoa!
[1599.54 --> 1600.54]  The slide in this is kinda...
[1600.54 --> 1601.54]  Douchebaggery.
[1601.54 --> 1602.54]  Douchebaggery.
[1602.54 --> 1603.54]  Douchebaggery.
[1603.54 --> 1604.54]  I love how you do the exact same things.
[1604.54 --> 1605.54]  Um, yes.
[1605.54 --> 1614.54]  Apparently Oblivion also maxes out at 255 and thinking that 99 is the max means you're basically
[1614.54 --> 1615.54]  a RuneScape player.
[1615.54 --> 1616.54]  What?
[1616.54 --> 1618.54]  There's other games that have 99 as the max, by the way.
[1618.54 --> 1619.54]  Can you not?
[1619.54 --> 1621.54]  Like, can you actually just not do that?
[1621.54 --> 1622.54]  Fine, stay there.
[1622.54 --> 1623.54]  I don't care.
[1623.54 --> 1624.54]  Sup, yo.
[1624.54 --> 1625.54]  Oh, no.
[1625.54 --> 1626.54]  Oh, no.
[1626.54 --> 1627.54]  Oh, no.
[1627.54 --> 1628.54]  Oh, no.
[1628.54 --> 1629.54]  Oh, no.
[1629.54 --> 1630.54]  Oh, no.
[1630.54 --> 1631.54]  Oh, no.
[1631.54 --> 1632.54]  Oh, no.
[1632.54 --> 1633.54]  Oh, no.
[1633.54 --> 1634.54]  Oh, no.
[1634.54 --> 1635.54]  Oh, no.
[1635.54 --> 1636.54]  Oh, no.
[1636.54 --> 1637.54]  Oh, no.
[1637.54 --> 1638.54]  Oh, no.
[1638.54 --> 1639.54]  Oh, no.
[1639.54 --> 1640.54]  Oh, no.
[1640.54 --> 1641.54]  Oh, no.
[1641.54 --> 1642.54]  Oh, no.
[1642.54 --> 1643.54]  Oh, no.
[1643.54 --> 1644.54]  Oh, no.
[1644.54 --> 1645.54]  Okay.
[1645.54 --> 1646.54]  Go for it.
[1646.54 --> 1647.54]  Good job.
[1647.54 --> 1648.54]  No.
[1648.54 --> 1649.54]  Cool strategy.
[1649.54 --> 1650.54]  Bro.
[1650.54 --> 1651.54]  Uh, someone says, where's the Techno episode?
[1651.54 --> 1652.54]  I don't know.
[1652.54 --> 1653.54]  I thought Logan streams on Fridays or something.
[1653.54 --> 1655.54]  I could have misunderstood.
[1655.54 --> 1673.54]  I still think Logan and I should do something like super collaborative at some point, because
[1673.54 --> 1674.54]  we never really have.
[1674.54 --> 1676.54]  Like, even me and Unbox Therapy, we did a giveaway at one point.
[1676.54 --> 1677.54]  Mm-hmm.
[1677.54 --> 1680.54]  But we've never done anything with Logan, really.
[1680.54 --> 1683.54]  He's super cool.
[1683.54 --> 1684.54]  Yep.
[1684.54 --> 1686.54]  I like him.
[1686.54 --> 1690.54]  He gets a Linus Tech Tips gold star of approval.
[1690.54 --> 1691.54]  Oh.
[1691.54 --> 1694.54]  Maybe that should be our merch item.
[1694.54 --> 1695.54]  A gold star of approval?
[1695.54 --> 1697.54]  A Linus Tech Tips gold star of approval.
[1697.54 --> 1698.54]  Oh, no.
[1698.54 --> 1699.54]  I do.
[1699.54 --> 1700.54]  Yes.
[1700.54 --> 1701.54]  Thank you for the mushroom.
[1701.54 --> 1702.54]  Oh, also, here you go.
[1702.54 --> 1703.54]  Oh, no.
[1703.54 --> 1704.54]  Okay.
[1704.54 --> 1705.54]  Well, sort of worked.
[1705.54 --> 1706.54]  Okay.
[1706.54 --> 1708.54]  I'm down with it at that point.
[1708.54 --> 1709.54]  Okay.
[1709.54 --> 1712.54]  I'm out of here.
[1712.54 --> 1714.54]  You can hang down there.
[1714.54 --> 1716.54]  Yeah, that does kind of suck.
[1716.54 --> 1717.54]  Here's a shelf for you.
[1717.54 --> 1718.54]  Good luck getting up here.
[1718.54 --> 1721.54]  Oh, there's a mushroom.
[1721.54 --> 1722.54]  Thank you.
[1722.54 --> 1724.54]  Maybe I should come down there and bully you.
[1724.54 --> 1725.54]  I think that's what I'll do.
[1725.54 --> 1727.54]  Because that's what you would do.
[1727.54 --> 1728.54]  Yes!
[1728.54 --> 1729.54]  Fast hurdle for the win.
[1732.54 --> 1733.54]  Okay.
[1733.54 --> 1736.54]  I'll remind you that I wasn't the person to start the bullying.
[1736.54 --> 1737.54]  To start the bullying?
[1737.54 --> 1738.54]  Yeah.
[1738.54 --> 1740.54]  You went straight for the pow in the middle and did not lay off it.
[1740.54 --> 1741.54]  Because I didn't know what it did.
[1741.54 --> 1743.54]  Because you didn't know what it did?
[1743.54 --> 1745.54]  That is a bald-faced lie.
[1745.54 --> 1747.54]  I've never played this game before.
[1747.54 --> 1750.54]  You have never played Super Mario World 3.
[1750.54 --> 1754.54]  I've never played this battle mode thing.
[1754.54 --> 1755.54]  You've never played battle mode?
[1755.54 --> 1756.54]  No!
[1756.54 --> 1757.54]  I said that at the start!
[1757.54 --> 1758.54]  Yeah, but I wasn't listening!
[1758.54 --> 1759.54]  Yes, you were!
[1759.54 --> 1760.54]  Well, I don't care!
[1760.54 --> 1762.54]  You said I can't believe you never played battle mode.
[1762.54 --> 1763.54]  That means you were obviously listening.
[1763.54 --> 1765.54]  I can't believe it still.
[1765.54 --> 1767.54]  Wow.
[1767.54 --> 1769.54]  Oh, fast turtle.
[1769.54 --> 1773.54]  When their feet are moving faster, when they come out of the tube, it means they're fast turtles.
[1773.54 --> 1774.54]  Okay.
[1774.54 --> 1776.54]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[1776.54 --> 1778.54]  Okay, we have a situation.
[1778.54 --> 1781.54]  And I just totally handed you that.
[1781.54 --> 1782.54]  I handed you that.
[1782.54 --> 1784.54]  I could be like, you would be, thank you!
[1784.54 --> 1785.54]  Thank you so much!
[1785.54 --> 1786.54]  Oh, you're welcome.
[1786.54 --> 1787.54]  That was fantastic.
[1787.54 --> 1790.54]  See, that is how you graciously accept someone's thanks.
[1790.54 --> 1792.54]  You're welcome, Slick.
[1792.54 --> 1794.54]  I both like and respect you.
[1794.54 --> 1797.54]  You've said opposite during this very after party.
[1797.54 --> 1800.54]  Yeah, but see, it's not always, oh, that's mine.
[1800.54 --> 1802.54]  It's not always about that.
[1802.54 --> 1804.54]  It's not always about what you say.
[1804.54 --> 1805.54]  It's what you mean.
[1805.54 --> 1807.54]  Okay.
[1807.54 --> 1808.54]  You wouldn't understand.
[1808.54 --> 1809.54]  No?
[1809.54 --> 1810.54]  No.
[1810.54 --> 1811.54]  Whoa!
[1811.54 --> 1812.54]  Oh, no!
[1812.54 --> 1813.54]  Okay, that was sort of boomed.
[1813.54 --> 1814.54]  Doomed.
[1814.54 --> 1815.54]  Boomed?
[1815.54 --> 1817.54]  Well, it was boomed and doomed.
[1817.54 --> 1818.54]  Someone says, can you switch games now to Super Mario Kart?
[1818.54 --> 1819.54]  This is getting boring.
[1819.54 --> 1820.54]  I told you.
[1820.54 --> 1822.54]  We can play Super Mario Kart.
[1822.54 --> 1823.54]  We can play Super Mario Kart.
[1823.54 --> 1824.54]  Someone says, how can I call in?
[1824.54 --> 1825.54]  We're not doing call-ins today.
[1825.54 --> 1826.54]  Unfortunately, we are.
[1826.54 --> 1829.54]  We are not doing that today, but we will do that later.
[1829.54 --> 1830.54]  Like, next week.
[1830.54 --> 1831.54]  Next week specifically, isn't it?
[1831.54 --> 1832.54]  We're doing it next week?
[1832.54 --> 1833.54]  Yes.
[1833.54 --> 1834.54]  Well, it should be.
[1834.54 --> 1835.54]  Like, next week.
[1835.54 --> 1836.54]  We're doing it next week.
[1836.54 --> 1837.54]  Well, it should be.
[1837.54 --> 1838.54]  Like, next week.
[1838.54 --> 1839.54]  Yeah.
[1839.54 --> 1840.54]  Yeah.
[1840.54 --> 1841.54]  Yeah.
[1841.54 --> 1842.54]  Yeah.
[1842.54 --> 1843.54]  Yeah.
[1843.54 --> 1844.54]  Yeah.
[1844.54 --> 1845.54]  Yeah.
[1845.54 --> 1846.54]  Yeah.
[1846.54 --> 1847.54]  Yeah.
[1847.54 --> 1848.54]  Yeah.
[1848.54 --> 1849.54]  Yeah.
[1849.54 --> 1850.54]  Yeah.
[1850.54 --> 1851.54]  Yeah.
[1851.54 --> 1852.54]  Yeah.
[1852.54 --> 1853.54]  99 percent.
[1853.54 --> 1855.54]  Oh, mushroom, mushroom.
[1855.54 --> 1856.54]  Badger, badger.
[1856.54 --> 1857.54]  Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger.
[1857.54 --> 1858.54]  Badger, badger, badger, badger.
[1858.54 --> 1860.46]  ung Бeer,
[1860.46 --> 1861.46]  badger.
[1861.46 --> 1862.46]  soulshell!
[1862.46 --> 1866.42]  badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, BRADGER.
[1866.42 --> 1867.42]  Oh.
[1867.42 --> 1868.42]  Here we go.
[1868.42 --> 1870.42]  Boom!
[1870.42 --> 1872.42]  Okay.
[1872.42 --> 1873.42]  I'm gonna win by coins this time.
[1873.42 --> 1876.96]  If I can even do that in the time it takes you to kill yourself.
[1876.96 --> 1877.96]  Boom!
[1877.96 --> 1878.96]  Oh, I know.
[1878.96 --> 1879.96]  Okay.
[1879.96 --> 1880.96]  Ah, shoot.
[1880.96 --> 1881.96]  Okay.
[1881.96 --> 1888.40]  Oh no, oh no.
[1889.20 --> 1889.56]  Okay.
[1890.42 --> 1890.92]  Yeah, we...
[1890.92 --> 1895.56]  You know, I haven't actually played Mario Kart for Super Nintendo that much.
[1895.56 --> 1895.66]  Ah.
[1897.12 --> 1898.94]  We've played Mario Kart in general a lot, though.
[1899.20 --> 1902.24]  Someone says Linus, you and Slick should play multiplayer games with us.
[1902.36 --> 1905.58]  We were supposed to do that this stream, and then he decided that we were doing this.
[1905.96 --> 1908.72]  Well, actually, I thought it was a group decision that was made.
[1908.72 --> 1909.22]  No, it wasn't.
[1909.24 --> 1909.72]  On the way here.
[1909.90 --> 1910.48]  No, it wasn't.
[1910.50 --> 1911.38]  That was a team decision.
[1911.38 --> 1912.12]  On the way here?
[1912.14 --> 1912.86]  And now...
[1912.86 --> 1913.64]  On the way here.
[1913.70 --> 1913.98]  Because...
[1913.98 --> 1916.32]  When you're riding your bike by yourself, it was a group decision?
[1916.88 --> 1919.66]  Well, I mean, I could have been on the phone with you.
[1920.44 --> 1922.60]  But that would be terrible and not legal.
[1923.14 --> 1926.60]  It's not like anything else I did to get here on time for the stream was legal.
[1927.42 --> 1927.82]  Whoa.
[1932.06 --> 1935.30]  I mean, like, you're not allowed to run over nuns, right?
[1937.16 --> 1939.18]  I actually didn't run over a nun, you guys.
[1939.20 --> 1940.30]  That would be horrible.
[1941.38 --> 1943.04]  Yeah, what did nuns ever do to us?
[1943.96 --> 1947.84]  Hey, that was actually my coin, which I did not give you permission to have.
[1949.04 --> 1949.68]  I'm sorry.
[1950.10 --> 1950.88]  You're not sorry.
[1951.42 --> 1952.46]  Oh, wow.
[1952.76 --> 1954.40]  So you're going to camp the POW.
[1954.98 --> 1956.22]  That's how it's going to be.
[1956.36 --> 1957.70]  You made me go down there.
[1957.70 --> 1960.02]  I made you go down there.
[1960.06 --> 1962.58]  I was up here and then you threw a shell at me like you just did, so I went down.
[1962.70 --> 1964.02]  Well, that is how it's done.
[1965.06 --> 1966.70]  Someone wants to know...
[1966.70 --> 1968.76]  Okay.
[1969.00 --> 1969.68]  Last round.
[1969.82 --> 1970.18]  Last round.
[1971.18 --> 1972.66]  Winner takes all on this one, okay?
[1972.72 --> 1972.96]  Oh, my God.
[1973.70 --> 1974.46]  We got this.
[1975.46 --> 1977.82]  Someone says they want to kick Linus' face.
[1978.16 --> 1979.46]  Or lick his face.
[1979.60 --> 1980.68]  I'm not sure which one that is.
[1980.68 --> 1982.00]  I'm going to go with kick.
[1982.10 --> 1983.68]  That actually makes me more comfortable.
[1987.82 --> 1991.44]  Okay, so what makes the coins even come out?
[1991.52 --> 1992.24]  You have to kill a dude.
[1993.22 --> 1994.16]  Oh, okay.
[1994.50 --> 1997.68]  Anytime a dude dies, then the next thing that comes out of the tube will be a coin.
[1997.68 --> 2001.18]  Oh, crap.
[2002.44 --> 2004.40]  Wow, that was actually kind of lucky right there.
[2007.30 --> 2008.68]  Oh, that was lucky, too.
[2009.14 --> 2009.58]  Anytime...
[2009.58 --> 2009.88]  Oh, wait.
[2009.98 --> 2010.64]  I'm Mario.
[2010.78 --> 2011.20]  Oh, wow.
[2011.28 --> 2013.60]  I was controlling the wrong guy that whole time.
[2013.78 --> 2015.22]  I think I might have been as well.
[2016.44 --> 2017.14]  I just...
[2017.14 --> 2017.48]  I got mixed up.
[2017.48 --> 2019.86]  Not a few times, but you just get figured out pretty quick.
[2019.86 --> 2023.92]  I wish the characters looked a little different.
[2024.50 --> 2025.40]  Oh, crap.
[2025.64 --> 2026.44]  Stupid fast noodles.
[2026.44 --> 2029.18]  I'm wondering if they can play multiplayer games with us.
[2029.26 --> 2030.36]  I think that'll be really cool.
[2030.66 --> 2031.22]  Someone...
[2031.22 --> 2032.44]  We talked about this already.
[2032.64 --> 2033.10]  On the stream?
[2034.00 --> 2034.70]  I'm pretty sure.
[2034.90 --> 2036.20]  No, we talked about it offline.
[2037.22 --> 2037.78]  So, yeah.
[2037.90 --> 2038.44]  We do want to do that.
[2038.44 --> 2041.90]  No, we definitely bring it up during the stream because someone messaged me showing me how to do it.
[2041.98 --> 2043.74]  We were asking how we should do it.
[2044.78 --> 2045.24]  Yeah, no.
[2045.26 --> 2046.20]  I think that'd be really cool.
[2046.20 --> 2053.60]  We should play, like, good games that are retro and are obviously games that we've both played
[2053.60 --> 2055.74]  because you've obviously played this before.
[2055.74 --> 2056.80]  No, I haven't!
[2056.96 --> 2058.00]  I don't believe you.
[2058.72 --> 2059.24]  Wow.
[2064.26 --> 2070.38]  So, anyway, we were discussing earlier the Linus' likes and Slick's deals sections of the forum.
[2071.24 --> 2077.04]  Why don't we go over what we would want as, like, our optimal Linus' like and, like, Slick's deal things.
[2077.12 --> 2077.52]  Like...
[2077.52 --> 2078.14]  Oh, my God.
[2078.18 --> 2079.46]  I can never leave this place.
[2079.46 --> 2082.74]  What do you mean?
[2082.84 --> 2085.52]  Like, what things we would pick or how we want to distribute it?
[2085.90 --> 2086.24]  Yeah.
[2086.24 --> 2088.74]  Like, what would you pick for, like...
[2088.74 --> 2096.80]  Because, okay, stuff like graphics cards is really hard because there's so little differentiation from graphics card to graphics card that I just...
[2096.80 --> 2099.30]  Like, I don't know how exactly you would...
[2099.30 --> 2103.00]  Maybe for graphics card we would do, like, uh...
[2103.00 --> 2104.30]  No, instead of, um...
[2106.36 --> 2107.64]  Like, a specific card.
[2108.32 --> 2110.24]  Ah, but then sometimes I would want to do that, too.
[2110.28 --> 2112.06]  Yeah, sometimes you'd want to pick a specific card.
[2112.14 --> 2112.40]  Like, remember...
[2112.40 --> 2114.86]  Maybe it doesn't have to be fixed like that.
[2115.42 --> 2118.50]  Like, 7970 Matrix was amazing.
[2118.82 --> 2119.78]  That was a really cool card.
[2120.08 --> 2121.64]  Overclocked, like, a champ.
[2121.64 --> 2123.54]  660 Ti Power Edition Original.
[2123.54 --> 2125.40]  Yep, 660 Ti Power Edition Original.
[2126.40 --> 2127.40]  That was awesome.
[2128.88 --> 2129.52]  Um...
[2129.52 --> 2130.46]  Oh, wow.
[2130.70 --> 2133.44]  There's been other stuff, too, but then sometimes it's a category.
[2134.06 --> 2136.12]  Someone wants a StarCraft free-for-all.
[2136.82 --> 2140.46]  It would be, like, me and, like, four other people versus someone decent.
[2141.00 --> 2141.40]  That's...
[2141.40 --> 2142.86]  That is the support I would need.
[2143.58 --> 2146.58]  I've played two rounds of StarCraft II.
[2147.00 --> 2147.48]  Total.
[2147.48 --> 2151.76]  And I haven't played since, like, Wings of Liberty launched.
[2151.78 --> 2153.60]  Do you have, uh, Heart of the Storm?
[2153.72 --> 2153.90]  Nope.
[2154.48 --> 2154.72]  Okay.
[2154.90 --> 2155.74]  I only have Wings of Liberty.
[2155.86 --> 2159.24]  I think there's some, like, grandfathering thing you can do now or whatever.
[2159.62 --> 2159.92]  Oh, yeah?
[2160.06 --> 2161.18]  So you don't have to have both?
[2161.38 --> 2164.02]  I think you can invite someone into the...
[2164.02 --> 2164.70]  It's like, uh...
[2164.70 --> 2165.38]  Oh, like spawning.
[2165.60 --> 2165.76]  Yeah.
[2166.28 --> 2167.44]  It's like modern spawning.
[2167.58 --> 2168.82]  They enabled it about that long ago.
[2168.86 --> 2169.18]  Boom!
[2169.18 --> 2169.48]  Oh!
[2170.96 --> 2171.62]  You're welcome.
[2173.04 --> 2173.32]  Whoop!
[2174.22 --> 2175.16]  Wow, okay.
[2176.10 --> 2176.68]  Oh, shoot.
[2176.68 --> 2176.76]  No!
[2176.76 --> 2176.84]  Boo!
[2177.20 --> 2177.70]  Oh, cool.
[2178.14 --> 2178.52]  Oh, boo.
[2181.46 --> 2185.24]  Wow, the POW actually, uh, kills ghosts.
[2185.54 --> 2186.12]  Does it?
[2186.24 --> 2187.32]  I did not know that.
[2187.44 --> 2187.86]  That's cool.
[2188.16 --> 2188.46]  Yeah.
[2189.34 --> 2190.46]  It kills them dead.
[2191.14 --> 2192.36]  I've always wondered about that.
[2192.40 --> 2194.38]  Like, you know the expression, like, kill them dead?
[2194.68 --> 2196.84]  Like, what other kind of killing can you do?
[2198.50 --> 2200.40]  Like, kill them senile?
[2202.74 --> 2203.48]  Sure, go ahead.
[2203.56 --> 2204.64]  Is this even possible?
[2204.64 --> 2205.48]  Does that...
[2205.48 --> 2207.14]  Does that work?
[2208.28 --> 2210.98]  Yeah, I was really expecting you to get hit at the same time.
[2211.70 --> 2212.66]  Which would have been better.
[2215.32 --> 2216.52]  Gotcha with the shell again.
[2217.04 --> 2220.12]  I was pretty sure I hit the top of that, considering I died above it.
[2220.12 --> 2224.90]  I'm pretty sure that in-game physics were pretty advanced when this game was new.
[2225.08 --> 2225.68]  It's not physics.
[2225.90 --> 2226.98]  It's whether or not I hit the top.
[2226.98 --> 2230.94]  I'm pretty sure that hit detection was actually pretty advanced when this game was new.
[2231.70 --> 2235.86]  So, uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure that whatever you think happened is not what actually happened.
[2235.86 --> 2238.36]  You're welcome.
[2238.36 --> 2238.96]  What the...
[2238.96 --> 2240.22]  Oh, it changes position?
[2240.68 --> 2242.56]  Position and status.
[2243.14 --> 2246.48]  But it didn't change position before, so it must be if you're both full it changes position.
[2246.48 --> 2247.20]  It might do one or the other.
[2247.40 --> 2247.64]  Yeah.
[2247.82 --> 2249.84]  Because it's a question mark, not like a...
[2249.84 --> 2250.78]  So you're not really sure.
[2250.78 --> 2252.08]  A changing...
[2252.08 --> 2252.36]  Yeah.
[2253.02 --> 2254.14]  That was kind of cool, though.
[2254.54 --> 2254.86]  What?
[2254.96 --> 2256.26]  Because I had no idea what was going on.
[2256.28 --> 2257.34]  It just, like, bopped you one.
[2258.58 --> 2259.50]  There's another one for you.
[2259.50 --> 2261.34]  No way!
[2262.00 --> 2263.12]  That was pretty neat, though.
[2263.14 --> 2264.20]  I've done that a couple times.
[2265.96 --> 2267.04]  Uh, where'd it go?
[2267.44 --> 2269.70]  It just went out one of the tubes and didn't come back.
[2269.80 --> 2270.76]  Now there's a fast Koopa.
[2271.16 --> 2271.96]  What the...
[2271.96 --> 2274.16]  Yeah, that's what happens when they go in...
[2274.16 --> 2277.18]  Uh, when they go in fast and they come out, like, walking fast.
[2277.66 --> 2278.18]  That's...
[2278.18 --> 2278.80]  Oh, God.
[2279.34 --> 2279.98]  I can't...
[2279.98 --> 2281.90]  These guys are...
[2281.90 --> 2282.24]  Move.
[2282.52 --> 2283.16]  I can go this way.
[2284.04 --> 2284.74]  No, you can't.
[2284.86 --> 2285.38]  Oh, no.
[2285.64 --> 2285.94]  No, no.
[2286.06 --> 2286.34]  Get him.
[2286.46 --> 2286.70]  Get him.
[2286.84 --> 2287.10]  Get him.
[2288.60 --> 2289.08]  Chase him.
[2289.16 --> 2289.48]  Chase him.
[2290.02 --> 2290.74]  Need more shells.
[2290.92 --> 2291.64]  More shells!
[2292.04 --> 2292.40]  Ah!
[2293.48 --> 2294.52]  Oh, you're big now.
[2295.80 --> 2296.64]  You lucked out.
[2296.96 --> 2297.72]  Oh, my...
[2297.72 --> 2300.36]  Anytime I win, it's skill, and anytime you win, it's luck.
[2300.44 --> 2301.08]  Just remember that.
[2301.18 --> 2301.32]  Yeah.
[2301.44 --> 2302.02]  And you'll be fine.
[2302.28 --> 2302.48]  Okay.
[2302.64 --> 2303.08]  Boom!
[2305.72 --> 2308.16]  You've never really played video games with me much, have you?
[2308.54 --> 2309.60]  It's kind of unpleasant.
[2309.90 --> 2310.72]  You're very obnoxious.
[2311.60 --> 2314.32]  Is it any different from how I am at all other times?
[2315.08 --> 2315.44]  Really?
[2317.40 --> 2317.80]  Slightly.
[2318.44 --> 2318.80]  Slightly?
[2318.80 --> 2319.24]  Yes.
[2319.24 --> 2320.06]  But in a good way.
[2320.42 --> 2320.66]  No.
[2321.04 --> 2321.28]  No.
[2321.44 --> 2321.66]  Okay.
[2322.42 --> 2324.18]  Someone says, play a different game.
[2324.70 --> 2326.94]  This is probably not that entertaining to watch.
[2327.00 --> 2327.68]  I like this game.
[2327.68 --> 2329.16]  Especially because we probably both suck at it.
[2329.56 --> 2330.12]  I'm good.
[2330.34 --> 2331.48]  I've never played before.
[2331.48 --> 2332.44]  Oh, and the screen's off.
[2332.44 --> 2334.00]  And you're not beating me by that much.
[2334.10 --> 2335.16]  That's not a good sign.
[2335.16 --> 2340.34]  Well, actually, that could be a good sign because it could mean that the game is well designed.
[2341.02 --> 2342.42]  Easy to learn, difficult to master.
[2342.54 --> 2343.58]  That's the mark of a good game.
[2343.58 --> 2346.80]  So you're like the learner and I'm like the master.
[2347.26 --> 2348.68]  But there's just not that much difference.
[2348.70 --> 2349.52]  Except there's not much of a difference.
[2349.62 --> 2349.82]  Yeah.
[2350.60 --> 2351.78]  That's what I'm talking about.
[2354.60 --> 2356.36]  Someone says there's no sound for the game.
[2357.30 --> 2358.26]  Someone says play Minecraft.
[2358.62 --> 2358.88]  Okay.
[2359.02 --> 2359.24]  Okay.
[2359.34 --> 2361.80]  Last round because Slick's not going to win it.
[2362.42 --> 2364.14]  Because my perfection is too complete.
[2364.14 --> 2370.14]  Actually, it's not perfect if you lose one, is it?
[2370.58 --> 2370.76]  No.
[2370.82 --> 2371.68]  Do you want to play some Mortal Kombat?
[2373.22 --> 2374.66]  Also, never really played those kind of final games.
[2374.66 --> 2375.02]  Me neither.
[2375.34 --> 2375.86]  Okay, perfect.
[2376.14 --> 2376.34]  Yeah.
[2376.66 --> 2379.14]  So, no, this is going to be like the ultimate noob fest.
[2379.70 --> 2381.52]  I thought you were going to hit by that crab.
[2383.32 --> 2385.16]  If there's anyone here with crabs, it's you.
[2387.28 --> 2389.16]  That's not even a funny joke.
[2389.26 --> 2389.84]  That's horrible.
[2390.00 --> 2391.10]  You're talking about crabs.
[2391.38 --> 2392.08]  That's horrible.
[2392.24 --> 2393.46]  But I don't have that crab.
[2393.46 --> 2394.94]  You're hit by that crab.
[2395.52 --> 2397.60]  Well, if you get hit by crabs, you probably have it.
[2399.10 --> 2400.18]  You're talking about that one.
[2400.44 --> 2400.66]  Yeah.
[2400.78 --> 2401.86]  You just jumped out of context.
[2402.38 --> 2402.70]  Right.
[2403.74 --> 2405.74]  Well, what kind of crabs did you think I was talking about?
[2406.02 --> 2406.54]  Oh, crap.
[2406.60 --> 2407.04]  I pressed start.
[2407.74 --> 2408.10]  Okay.
[2408.24 --> 2409.48]  So, guys, we're going to switch games.
[2409.54 --> 2410.22]  We'll be back in a moment.
[2411.50 --> 2412.64]  Do we have to just...
[2412.64 --> 2413.74]  Oh, I guess kind of.
[2414.74 --> 2415.48]  No, we're...
[2415.48 --> 2415.90]  See, we're here.
[2416.12 --> 2416.64]  Okay, cool.
[2416.70 --> 2417.82]  So, we're going to switch games, guys.
[2418.52 --> 2419.52]  See, I'm ready for this.
[2419.52 --> 2421.32]  We're taking out the cartridge right now.
[2421.42 --> 2421.62]  Yep.
[2422.00 --> 2423.20]  Taking out the cartridge.
[2423.72 --> 2424.28]  Oh, hold on.
[2424.32 --> 2425.30]  This other one's kind of dusty.
[2425.44 --> 2425.78]  Give me...
[2425.78 --> 2426.00]  Yeah.
[2426.84 --> 2428.66]  I had the exact same thought.
[2429.72 --> 2430.08]  Yes!
[2430.38 --> 2431.42]  Ew, you're sweaty.
[2431.52 --> 2432.18]  So are you.
[2432.66 --> 2433.74]  Not as sweaty as you.
[2434.58 --> 2435.02]  I don't know.
[2435.12 --> 2436.50]  I'm pretty sure that was your sweat.
[2436.50 --> 2436.76]  I kind of splashed a little bit.
[2436.80 --> 2437.86]  Because your sweat's cold.
[2438.00 --> 2438.82]  That's how I can tell.
[2438.82 --> 2446.32]  There's definitely two different parts of sweat there.
[2446.64 --> 2447.54]  Because that is...
[2447.54 --> 2448.62]  This is disgusting, man.
[2448.72 --> 2450.58]  Well, I'm sweaty, but it's not my hands.
[2450.62 --> 2451.56]  It's like my butt crack.
[2451.98 --> 2454.22]  Well, then, were you wiping your butt crack with your hands?
[2454.24 --> 2455.24]  That's very possible.
[2456.20 --> 2456.96]  Here, you know what?
[2456.96 --> 2458.14]  I'm going to consult the Twitch chat.
[2458.20 --> 2458.96]  What game should we play?
[2459.92 --> 2461.32]  We're not playing Pokemon Stadium.
[2461.86 --> 2463.22]  It has to be an SNES game.
[2463.22 --> 2467.62]  Okay, there's a lot of people asking for Mario Kart.
[2469.00 --> 2471.22]  A lot of people asking for Mario Kart.
[2471.66 --> 2472.16]  Mortal Kombat.
[2472.86 --> 2473.60]  Mortal Kombat.
[2474.48 --> 2475.98]  No one's really asking for Mortal Kombat.
[2476.04 --> 2476.90]  Oh, is my Twitch...
[2476.90 --> 2478.50]  I think my Twitch chat's not working.
[2480.58 --> 2482.84]  Yeah, my Twitch chat is not doing anything.
[2484.58 --> 2486.66]  So, we're going to rely on you here.
[2487.28 --> 2488.04]  Okay, what do they want?
[2488.52 --> 2491.78]  There's a lot of Mario Kart, but I'm not necessarily feeling Mario Kart.
[2491.86 --> 2493.14]  You're not feeling the Mario Kart?
[2493.22 --> 2493.60]  Not really.
[2493.70 --> 2495.36]  Should we go with, like, Mortal Kombat 1?
[2495.56 --> 2496.36]  I'm down with that.
[2496.54 --> 2497.34]  Mortal Kombat 1?
[2497.58 --> 2499.52]  We're both going to be terrible, and it's going to be awesome.
[2499.58 --> 2501.30]  Yeah, it's going to be kind of cool.
[2501.88 --> 2503.78]  Or kind of just stupid.
[2504.08 --> 2505.40]  My laptop's going to die soon.
[2506.08 --> 2508.40]  Is there a plug near here, or do I have to go...
[2510.02 --> 2510.50]  Yes!
[2511.22 --> 2512.40]  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[2513.18 --> 2515.56]  I plugged in the stream computer this time,
[2515.66 --> 2517.38]  so we don't have to worry about that one running out of battery.
[2520.58 --> 2521.26]  And, oh!
[2521.46 --> 2523.00]  The week that you weren't here...
[2523.00 --> 2524.62]  Um...
[2524.62 --> 2525.52]  The camera.
[2525.72 --> 2526.96]  Like, hardcore ran out of battery.
[2527.30 --> 2527.60]  Really?
[2527.72 --> 2527.92]  Yeah.
[2528.38 --> 2529.82]  At the end of the stream, I was just like,
[2529.86 --> 2530.48]  Okay, it's over.
[2532.76 --> 2534.50]  Okay, did you blow up the cartridge?
[2534.60 --> 2535.20]  Is it working now?
[2535.38 --> 2535.56]  Yeah.
[2535.68 --> 2536.18]  It's working now?
[2536.18 --> 2536.72]  Yeah, it's good.
[2537.06 --> 2537.58]  Okay, cool.
[2537.88 --> 2540.22]  So let's just switch to that there,
[2540.34 --> 2541.32]  Mortal Kombat cartridge.
[2541.98 --> 2542.68]  There we go.
[2542.68 --> 2544.86]  Doop, doop, doop, doop.
[2546.12 --> 2546.52]  Awesome.
[2547.72 --> 2550.48]  I, I, like, really haven't played this game much.
[2550.64 --> 2552.16]  I legit have never played this one.
[2552.28 --> 2553.44]  You have never played Mortal Kombat 1?
[2553.44 --> 2556.88]  I have played these type of fighters a few times at friends' houses.
[2557.06 --> 2559.24]  I've never owned one, and I've never played Mortal Kombat 1.
[2559.24 --> 2563.82]  Okay, well, I, uh, only owned one when I got this cartridge so we could stream with it.
[2564.66 --> 2565.50]  Uh, yes.
[2565.64 --> 2567.06]  Other than that, I never owned one.
[2567.64 --> 2568.04]  Yes.
[2569.14 --> 2569.54]  Options.
[2572.04 --> 2574.16]  My internet's just, like, not working in general.
[2575.28 --> 2575.54]  Really?
[2576.22 --> 2578.08]  Okay, game mode, I don't know.
[2578.62 --> 2580.84]  Uh, player one.
[2580.96 --> 2582.12]  Oh, oh, there's handicaps.
[2582.32 --> 2582.60]  Okay.
[2583.88 --> 2585.50]  Um, how do you go back?
[2585.86 --> 2586.32]  Whoop, whoop.
[2586.54 --> 2586.80]  Normal.
[2587.84 --> 2588.24]  Normal.
[2588.52 --> 2588.80]  Okay.
[2589.28 --> 2590.32]  Apparently all the buttons.
[2590.86 --> 2591.86]  Okay, you press start.
[2592.90 --> 2593.84]  Start to go back.
[2594.08 --> 2594.30]  Got it.
[2594.60 --> 2595.26]  Okay, so tournament.
[2595.50 --> 2599.48]  And, uh, alright.
[2599.96 --> 2600.54]  So press start.
[2600.92 --> 2604.14]  I think that's how, yep, there we go, because it works, like, hardcore arcade style.
[2604.58 --> 2605.62]  Okay, I'm going with Raiden.
[2606.18 --> 2607.92]  I just, oh, that, hmm.
[2608.76 --> 2610.46]  I just went with the first one that my selector was on.
[2610.48 --> 2611.38]  Sub-Zero's awesome, though.
[2611.40 --> 2611.60]  Yeah.
[2611.94 --> 2612.62]  Okay, here we go.
[2612.72 --> 2613.30]  Battle 1.
[2614.06 --> 2615.60]  He was the only one that I knew, actually.
[2616.00 --> 2616.92]  I knew he was Sub-Zero.
[2616.98 --> 2618.26]  Someone says game music, please.
[2618.78 --> 2621.34]  No, the, the thing about Raiden is he's the only one that I know a move for.
[2621.78 --> 2622.78]  And I don't really know it.
[2622.78 --> 2622.84]  Okay.
[2622.84 --> 2626.52]  Wow.
[2627.30 --> 2627.90]  This is going to be...
[2627.90 --> 2628.48]  Yeah, there we go.
[2628.68 --> 2629.12]  What?
[2630.16 --> 2630.52]  Yeah.
[2630.86 --> 2631.34]  Oh, shoot.
[2631.42 --> 2631.68]  Go away.
[2633.88 --> 2634.28]  Ah.
[2634.64 --> 2635.12]  Wow.
[2635.62 --> 2636.18]  Ah.
[2636.62 --> 2638.00]  That's totally not cool.
[2638.22 --> 2638.70]  Yes.
[2638.98 --> 2639.46]  Wow.
[2641.18 --> 2642.30]  That's ridiculous.
[2642.60 --> 2643.50]  Flawless victory.
[2643.50 --> 2644.50]  Okay.
[2647.16 --> 2648.48]  Can I, like, can I even duck it?
[2648.50 --> 2649.08]  Try it right now.
[2649.16 --> 2649.68]  Can I even duck it?
[2649.68 --> 2649.92]  Try it?
[2651.30 --> 2651.62]  No.
[2651.92 --> 2652.24]  Yes.
[2652.42 --> 2652.78]  Wow.
[2652.78 --> 2653.48]  Try jumping over it.
[2654.70 --> 2655.22]  Yeah, you could...
[2655.22 --> 2656.18]  There's such a delay.
[2656.32 --> 2658.54]  You could, like, jump better, and then you wouldn't have this problem.
[2658.92 --> 2659.48]  There we go.
[2659.54 --> 2659.92]  There you go.
[2661.36 --> 2663.06]  You could stop that anytime now.
[2663.06 --> 2663.60]  That'd be cool.
[2663.60 --> 2666.26]  You're just going to do your fly thing, and it's totally not going to matter.
[2666.26 --> 2667.26]  God.
[2671.58 --> 2672.80]  That's so annoying.
[2674.78 --> 2675.18]  Wow.
[2675.42 --> 2676.84]  Hey, you were the one who picked Mortal Kombat.
[2678.80 --> 2679.90]  Hey, stop it.
[2681.18 --> 2683.42]  Yours is way more annoying than me kicking.
[2683.56 --> 2684.58]  That's all I have to say.
[2686.42 --> 2686.86]  Wow.
[2687.12 --> 2687.82]  Round three.
[2688.20 --> 2688.58]  Fight.
[2689.64 --> 2692.18]  See, people are asking for sound, but we can just do it ourselves.
[2692.18 --> 2697.76]  So our legs never actually hit each other.
[2697.86 --> 2698.70]  Apparently, that's a thing.
[2699.34 --> 2699.56]  There you go.
[2699.56 --> 2700.34]  Oh, my.
[2701.02 --> 2703.20]  So I'm just going to do this, and then this.
[2705.68 --> 2707.30]  Why does your leg hit mine?
[2707.40 --> 2708.48]  Like, do you have, like, an attack?
[2708.62 --> 2709.02]  Oh, wow.
[2709.06 --> 2709.48]  I did a throw.
[2710.06 --> 2710.42]  Boom.
[2712.06 --> 2712.68]  Oh, okay.
[2713.96 --> 2715.12]  My guy is all, like...
[2715.12 --> 2716.74]  Yeah, I'll just materialize at a nothing.
[2717.98 --> 2718.98]  It's all, like, yeah, whatever.
[2719.32 --> 2720.04]  I'm just, like...
[2720.04 --> 2722.12]  You know, that's the stupidest thing ever in fighting games.
[2722.24 --> 2722.84]  Jump Punch.
[2723.12 --> 2723.52]  Look at him.
[2724.04 --> 2724.48]  Look at him.
[2727.96 --> 2731.00]  I don't know any of the, like, finishing moves.
[2731.14 --> 2731.30]  Yeah.
[2731.66 --> 2732.86]  They're cool, but I don't know.
[2734.50 --> 2734.82]  Okay.
[2735.28 --> 2736.70]  All right, I'm going to go with a different character.
[2736.86 --> 2739.10]  That's legitimately the only one...
[2739.10 --> 2739.60]  That's nuts.
[2739.72 --> 2740.60]  ...that I know any moves for.
[2740.60 --> 2743.60]  It would probably be a lot more entertaining to watch if we both knew any moves at all.
[2744.04 --> 2744.80]  No, probably not.
[2744.86 --> 2745.38]  I don't think so.
[2745.40 --> 2745.82]  Oh, okay.
[2745.92 --> 2746.08]  Yeah.
[2746.46 --> 2748.48]  I think half the point is that we totally suck.
[2748.58 --> 2749.28]  Oh, you press start.
[2749.32 --> 2750.20]  Press start, because you're dead.
[2750.80 --> 2751.06]  Oh.
[2751.06 --> 2753.20]  I think you have to, like, re-challenge me.
[2753.96 --> 2754.22]  What?
[2754.72 --> 2754.90]  What?
[2755.80 --> 2757.08]  Because it's an arcade game.
[2757.28 --> 2757.84]  So press start.
[2758.80 --> 2759.50]  I've been...
[2759.50 --> 2760.08]  Yeah, there you go.
[2760.68 --> 2761.04]  Okay.
[2761.04 --> 2765.54]  So, like, you died, and then, I guess, didn't insert a token.
[2765.84 --> 2767.52]  So you have to press start before...
[2767.52 --> 2767.56]  Oh!
[2768.06 --> 2769.22]  I want to be Sub-Zero this time.
[2769.52 --> 2770.20]  Sub-Zero's awesome.
[2771.20 --> 2772.50]  Sub-Zero wins.
[2772.76 --> 2774.08]  Did you ever watch the Mortal Kombat movie?
[2775.30 --> 2775.66]  No.
[2775.80 --> 2777.28]  It was total trash, but I loved it.
[2777.58 --> 2779.96]  I have the theme song for it, like, on my phone.
[2780.26 --> 2780.84]  And I...
[2780.84 --> 2781.92]  It's, like, in my playlist.
[2782.04 --> 2783.06]  Like, I legit listen to it.
[2783.12 --> 2783.32]  Awesome.
[2783.58 --> 2784.74]  It's so amazing.
[2784.74 --> 2786.98]  Hold on.
[2787.80 --> 2789.48]  I'm just gonna, like, button mash here.
[2790.50 --> 2791.08]  Hey, stop it.
[2791.70 --> 2792.34]  Hey, stop it!
[2793.16 --> 2794.56]  I'm not gonna get beat up by a girl.
[2794.64 --> 2795.30]  This is BS.
[2797.02 --> 2797.50]  Button mash!
[2797.56 --> 2798.00]  Button mash!
[2798.16 --> 2798.70]  Button mash!
[2798.76 --> 2799.22]  Button mash!
[2799.34 --> 2799.80]  Button mash!
[2799.88 --> 2800.30]  Button mash!
[2800.30 --> 2801.16]  Oh, Sonya wins.
[2801.32 --> 2801.50]  Okay.
[2803.02 --> 2803.42]  Okay.
[2803.60 --> 2804.14]  That's cool.
[2805.48 --> 2807.60]  Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B.A.?
[2807.60 --> 2809.68]  Because I went to the right and pressed a button.
[2812.22 --> 2814.14]  I wouldn't think too far into it, man.
[2814.44 --> 2815.20]  Because I didn't.
[2816.44 --> 2817.08]  Did I...
[2817.08 --> 2817.74]  Did you hit me?
[2818.20 --> 2819.84]  Does Sub-Zero have really long reach?
[2820.04 --> 2820.26]  No.
[2820.26 --> 2821.36]  Because I was able to hit Raiden.
[2822.32 --> 2823.52]  When Raiden couldn't hit me.
[2823.56 --> 2825.36]  No, I think Sonya has better reach than Sub-Zero.
[2825.52 --> 2825.70]  Yeah?
[2826.30 --> 2827.06]  Well, maybe not.
[2827.16 --> 2827.50]  I don't know.
[2827.50 --> 2831.78]  At least, like, Sub-Zero's moves look like real moves.
[2831.86 --> 2833.16]  Unlike that Raiden jump punch.
[2833.22 --> 2834.30]  Hold on, let's see his jump punch.
[2835.04 --> 2835.30]  See?
[2835.46 --> 2836.80]  He makes it look cool.
[2837.16 --> 2839.14]  He's all, like, flying jump punch.
[2841.46 --> 2842.46]  Raiden's like...
[2842.46 --> 2844.64]  Yeah, it's like flying monkey punch.
[2844.76 --> 2848.14]  I'm gonna put my arm in between my knees and hope it hits you.
[2849.02 --> 2851.74]  Someone's trying to buy a Z77 motherboard in the Twitch chat.
[2851.80 --> 2852.36]  Good luck with that.
[2855.14 --> 2856.00]  Oh, come on.
[2856.00 --> 2860.04]  Wow, uppercuts are way OP.
[2861.72 --> 2862.48]  Okay, then.
[2862.90 --> 2864.02]  Apparently it works for you, too.
[2865.44 --> 2865.84]  Aww.
[2866.76 --> 2867.64]  Press all the buttons.
[2869.62 --> 2870.96]  Like, block?
[2871.26 --> 2874.14]  And then just, like, left jab to the face.
[2876.28 --> 2876.68]  Awesome.
[2878.40 --> 2878.80]  Okay.
[2879.02 --> 2880.88]  If I press start, then I get to continue.
[2881.08 --> 2881.32]  Okay.
[2881.44 --> 2881.92]  There we go.
[2882.02 --> 2882.24]  Okay.
[2882.44 --> 2882.80]  Okay.
[2882.96 --> 2883.52]  You know what?
[2883.52 --> 2885.68]  Um, I'm gonna go with Johnny Cage.
[2885.70 --> 2886.56]  I'm gonna play this one now.
[2886.86 --> 2888.06]  I'm just gonna slowly go around.
[2888.06 --> 2889.28]  You know their names, at least, right?
[2889.94 --> 2890.76]  Not most of them.
[2890.82 --> 2891.04]  Really?
[2891.14 --> 2892.00]  You know this guy, right?
[2892.68 --> 2894.24]  Uh, no.
[2894.78 --> 2895.10]  What?
[2895.28 --> 2896.36]  I never played these games.
[2896.58 --> 2897.48]  But that's Scorpion.
[2898.58 --> 2899.00]  I know...
[2899.00 --> 2899.76]  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2899.76 --> 2900.70]  I thought you were talking about Cage.
[2900.76 --> 2901.34]  Oh, no, no, no.
[2901.34 --> 2901.96]  I know Scorpion.
[2902.58 --> 2902.76]  No.
[2902.76 --> 2905.74]  I'm like, I kind of know Cage, but if someone asks me off the spot, I...
[2905.74 --> 2908.02]  No, no, the only reason I know all the names is from the song.
[2909.52 --> 2909.88]  Oh.
[2910.12 --> 2913.84]  I know Scorpion because he's, like, very iconic.
[2914.52 --> 2916.26]  I knew Sub-Zero because he's very iconic.
[2916.62 --> 2921.24]  But I don't know these names from memorization from playing the game because that was never a thing that I did.
[2921.24 --> 2921.90]  Oh, come on.
[2921.94 --> 2923.06]  How was my timing off...
[2923.06 --> 2923.54]  There we go.
[2923.82 --> 2924.58]  Can I keep you in the air?
[2925.02 --> 2925.50]  There we go.
[2925.60 --> 2926.28]  Yes, throw!
[2926.48 --> 2926.76]  Throw?
[2926.90 --> 2927.56]  That was a lot of damage.
[2927.64 --> 2928.50]  And he puts on sunglasses.
[2928.50 --> 2929.06]  How do you throw?
[2929.44 --> 2929.74]  I have no idea.
[2929.74 --> 2930.74]  Does he put it on when he wins?
[2930.74 --> 2931.02]  Yeah.
[2931.24 --> 2931.60]  Awesome.
[2931.74 --> 2932.74]  Yeah, he's, like, um...
[2933.38 --> 2935.12]  That guy from the detective show.
[2935.12 --> 2935.26]  Yeah.
[2936.82 --> 2940.20]  Except, like, way cooler because he predates them by, like, ten years.
[2940.48 --> 2941.68]  And he's Johnny Cage.
[2942.56 --> 2943.30]  Johnny Cage.
[2943.36 --> 2944.80]  He's supposed to be, like, the American, right?
[2945.16 --> 2947.24]  Oh, I have no idea, but he sounds pretty American.
[2950.08 --> 2950.44]  Okay.
[2951.58 --> 2953.06]  Oh, I should have just uppercut there.
[2953.10 --> 2953.94]  I was trying to experiment.
[2954.14 --> 2954.62]  Yes!
[2954.76 --> 2955.58]  Flying Punch!
[2957.32 --> 2958.08]  Cage Punch!
[2958.88 --> 2959.24]  Elbow!
[2959.24 --> 2959.44]  Oh!
[2960.18 --> 2960.66]  Oh!
[2961.66 --> 2963.28]  Uppercuts are, like, brutal!
[2965.04 --> 2965.56]  Come close.
[2965.76 --> 2966.04]  Come on.
[2966.38 --> 2966.98]  Come on!
[2967.16 --> 2968.38]  Do not want...
[2968.38 --> 2971.92]  Do your flying thing.
[2972.68 --> 2973.42]  That's Raiden.
[2974.14 --> 2974.72]  I don't have that.
[2974.90 --> 2975.10]  So, okay.
[2975.72 --> 2976.70]  But, wouldn't...
[2976.70 --> 2976.90]  Hmm.
[2979.26 --> 2979.74]  Oh.
[2980.02 --> 2980.54]  Sweet.
[2981.54 --> 2981.90]  Whatever.
[2983.56 --> 2984.08]  Oh!
[2984.08 --> 2984.44]  Oh!
[2985.34 --> 2988.28]  I know why I'm probably not getting any of the combos.
[2988.28 --> 2991.94]  Because I'm not using, like, L or R buttons at all.
[2992.08 --> 2992.58]  Whoa!
[2992.66 --> 2993.14]  What's this?
[2994.84 --> 2995.28]  What?
[2995.76 --> 2997.00]  What the heck is that?
[2999.42 --> 3000.78]  What's that supposed to do?
[3001.88 --> 3002.36]  Whoa!
[3003.16 --> 3003.64]  Whoa!
[3003.70 --> 3004.26]  That was cool.
[3004.48 --> 3005.64]  He started off with a kick.
[3005.64 --> 3010.34]  You could just, like, not cheat when we're trying to figure things out.
[3010.78 --> 3012.90]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[3013.56 --> 3015.20]  Didn't even mean to do that.
[3016.94 --> 3017.90]  Yeah, that's right.
[3018.12 --> 3019.06]  How do you like them apples?
[3021.06 --> 3021.54]  Whoa!
[3021.68 --> 3022.32]  That was...
[3022.32 --> 3022.68]  Whoa!
[3022.68 --> 3022.80]  Whoa!
[3023.96 --> 3025.04]  There, I did it again.
[3025.54 --> 3026.80]  He's like breakdancing.
[3026.80 --> 3028.62]  Do, do, ch.
[3028.80 --> 3030.26]  Do, do, do, ch.
[3030.68 --> 3034.26]  You know, the difference between, uh...
[3034.26 --> 3036.30]  Like, martial arts and dancing.
[3036.60 --> 3038.56]  I'm not convinced that they're that different.
[3038.58 --> 3040.98]  Well, some of them are forms of dance, are they not?
[3041.88 --> 3042.52]  Um...
[3042.52 --> 3044.26]  I think that's less common.
[3044.26 --> 3044.46]  Capoeira.
[3046.04 --> 3048.74]  Capoeira was used because they were enslaved or something,
[3048.92 --> 3050.22]  so they wanted to train themselves to fight,
[3050.30 --> 3053.38]  but they had to not show that they were training themselves to fight.
[3053.40 --> 3054.20]  This is awesome.
[3054.20 --> 3056.34]  Someone's like, what's wrong with the textures?
[3057.66 --> 3057.94]  What?
[3058.40 --> 3060.60]  We're playing a SNES game, yo.
[3060.82 --> 3061.14]  What?
[3061.68 --> 3063.24]  It's a SNES game.
[3063.56 --> 3065.86]  They're, they're, yeah, the textures are not a thing.
[3066.42 --> 3068.00]  Okay, which selection box am I?
[3068.24 --> 3068.64]  You too.
[3068.76 --> 3069.30]  Okay, there we go.
[3069.54 --> 3071.00]  This guy has not been played yet, right?
[3071.00 --> 3071.86]  This is Cage.
[3072.52 --> 3073.28]  People are talking...
[3073.28 --> 3074.72]  We should talk about the forum being down.
[3074.76 --> 3075.32]  That's Liu Kang.
[3075.66 --> 3077.68]  People are talking about the forum being down in Europe.
[3078.62 --> 3080.18]  There's something going on in the Netherlands.
[3080.88 --> 3081.08]  Yeah.
[3081.08 --> 3081.74]  I have no idea.
[3081.86 --> 3082.78]  It could be on our end.
[3082.78 --> 3086.94]  I've gone through a ton of stuff that is telling me that it's not,
[3087.36 --> 3088.64]  but it still could be.
[3089.04 --> 3090.24]  I am looking into it.
[3091.82 --> 3093.10]  Apparently, this has always been a thing.
[3093.10 --> 3094.22]  Come on, Sub-Zero, do something.
[3095.42 --> 3097.26]  Oh, what a lazy piece of crap.
[3099.48 --> 3100.94]  Like, freeze him or something.
[3101.42 --> 3101.74]  Oh.
[3102.94 --> 3103.60]  So sorry.
[3103.82 --> 3105.04]  Apparently, that wasn't all it was.
[3105.10 --> 3105.74]  Flawless victory.
[3105.94 --> 3106.56]  Yeah, there we go.
[3106.56 --> 3108.56]  Um...
[3108.56 --> 3109.64]  Yeah.
[3109.84 --> 3110.24]  I don't know.
[3110.28 --> 3111.26]  I am looking into it.
[3111.30 --> 3112.32]  I'm not just ignoring it.
[3113.82 --> 3114.30]  Um...
[3114.30 --> 3115.10]  There we go.
[3116.00 --> 3116.36]  Boom!
[3116.54 --> 3117.22]  Flying punch!
[3117.40 --> 3117.70]  Oh!
[3118.08 --> 3118.58]  Sweep kick!
[3118.60 --> 3119.90]  I think he does have bigger range.
[3119.92 --> 3120.20]  Boom!
[3120.28 --> 3120.94]  Flying punch!
[3121.58 --> 3122.26]  Oh, okay.
[3122.48 --> 3124.02]  I was going for the sweep there, but that didn't work.
[3124.80 --> 3125.84]  Okay, how do you block?
[3126.26 --> 3126.72]  That's a block.
[3126.72 --> 3127.68]  It's one of the buttons.
[3128.68 --> 3128.96]  Okay.
[3129.30 --> 3130.32]  Boop, boop, boop.
[3131.60 --> 3133.14]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[3133.64 --> 3133.86]  What?
[3134.00 --> 3134.08]  Oh.
[3134.38 --> 3134.62]  Oh.
[3138.86 --> 3140.12]  I was watching the stream.
[3140.24 --> 3141.36]  That's not the right one to watch.
[3143.06 --> 3144.24]  Guys, we have another...
[3144.24 --> 3146.80]  We have a screen for the stream over there.
[3147.22 --> 3148.92]  And I was trying to...
[3148.92 --> 3150.88]  We both looked at the stream, and it was like,
[3150.94 --> 3153.44]  wait, that's not what's happening.
[3153.84 --> 3154.24]  Wow.
[3154.38 --> 3156.10]  I am getting owned here.
[3156.32 --> 3156.58]  Wood.
[3156.68 --> 3156.82]  Oh.
[3157.60 --> 3157.80]  What?
[3157.80 --> 3159.68]  Which one do we press?
[3159.70 --> 3160.32]  I don't know.
[3161.50 --> 3161.92]  Ah!
[3163.30 --> 3163.92]  I won.
[3164.82 --> 3166.46]  I don't think either of us won.
[3166.48 --> 3167.54]  Test your might.
[3168.18 --> 3170.16]  So they're just not even going to go.
[3172.54 --> 3173.66]  We're so bad.
[3174.74 --> 3175.14]  Okay.
[3175.44 --> 3178.50]  I need to do the freezing thing once.
[3178.50 --> 3180.16]  I've played almost every different person.
[3180.28 --> 3181.24]  That is all I need.
[3181.46 --> 3182.32]  I just wanted to bring that up.
[3182.62 --> 3183.44]  Three wins in a row.
[3183.62 --> 3183.96]  Champ.
[3184.76 --> 3186.62]  That doesn't actually make you a champ.
[3186.62 --> 3188.52]  You have to beat...
[3188.52 --> 3191.06]  You have to beat someone who's a champ to be a champ.
[3191.18 --> 3191.40]  Sure, sure.
[3191.56 --> 3193.44]  I am anything but a Mortal Kombat champ.
[3193.46 --> 3193.58]  Sure.
[3194.14 --> 3194.78]  Whatever you say.
[3195.84 --> 3197.80]  Can you just let me try things?
[3197.84 --> 3198.66]  Whoa, that was cool.
[3199.36 --> 3199.98]  Did you see that?
[3199.98 --> 3201.40]  Raiden's badass.
[3203.54 --> 3205.46]  I didn't know it was spelled like that, though.
[3206.68 --> 3207.52]  That's interesting.
[3208.00 --> 3209.58]  For reasons that won't be clear.
[3209.58 --> 3210.58]  Ha ha ha ha.
[3215.20 --> 3216.66]  Does it change later on, maybe?
[3216.96 --> 3217.50]  I doubt it.
[3219.46 --> 3220.64]  Maybe it does change.
[3220.64 --> 3220.96]  Ha ha ha.
[3220.96 --> 3222.76]  Ha ha ha.
[3222.76 --> 3223.36]  Ha ha ha.
[3223.36 --> 3223.92]  Ha ha ha.
[3223.92 --> 3224.48]  Ha ha ha.
[3224.48 --> 3224.58]  Ha ha ha.
[3224.58 --> 3225.00]  Ha ha ha.
[3225.00 --> 3225.50]  Ha ha ha.
[3225.50 --> 3227.00]  Ha ha ha.
[3227.00 --> 3227.08]  Ha ha ha.
[3227.08 --> 3227.14]  Ha ha ha.
[3227.14 --> 3228.74]  I'm trying to play the game.
[3228.74 --> 3230.74]  Ha ha ha.
[3230.74 --> 3233.10]  Okay, well, I at least don't want him to get a flawless victory.
[3233.10 --> 3234.14]  Come on, here we go.
[3234.14 --> 3235.82]  There we go.
[3235.82 --> 3236.18]  That...
[3236.18 --> 3237.02]  Knee to the face.
[3237.02 --> 3238.78]  His teleport thing is pretty cool.
[3238.78 --> 3240.78]  Knee to the face.
[3240.78 --> 3241.90]  Or a kick to the face.
[3241.90 --> 3242.66]  Something to the face.
[3242.66 --> 3243.66]  Hit him in the face.
[3243.66 --> 3245.18]  Oh, come on.
[3245.18 --> 3248.18]  Ha ha ha.
[3248.18 --> 3252.58]  Someone says, Linus, have you seen the Last of Us graphics with horrible jagged edges?
[3252.58 --> 3253.70]  Hi, Scuzzy.
[3253.70 --> 3257.30]  If you overclocked the SNES, it wouldn't lag.
[3258.74 --> 3260.74]  The...
[3260.74 --> 3262.74]  Our SNES is old.
[3262.74 --> 3263.74]  Okay.
[3263.74 --> 3265.74]  Yeah, our SNES is kinda laggy.
[3265.74 --> 3268.74]  Alright, I'm going for, uh, I'm going for Liu Kang this time.
[3268.74 --> 3269.74]  I've almost gone through every person.
[3269.74 --> 3271.74]  I don't know his name.
[3271.74 --> 3272.74]  I...
[3272.74 --> 3273.74]  I don't know, man.
[3273.74 --> 3276.74]  I think the problem is probably this game and we might want to switch to...
[3276.74 --> 3277.74]  Metal...
[3277.74 --> 3278.74]  Metal face man.
[3278.74 --> 3280.74]  We might want to dust off the Mortal Kombat 2 cartridge.
[3280.74 --> 3281.74]  Is that...
[3281.74 --> 3282.74]  Are you better at that one?
[3282.74 --> 3283.74]  Uh, no.
[3283.74 --> 3284.74]  That was kinda interesting.
[3284.74 --> 3285.74]  There we go.
[3285.74 --> 3286.74]  Wow.
[3286.74 --> 3287.74]  Boom.
[3287.74 --> 3288.74]  See?
[3288.74 --> 3292.74]  Like, your cheap, stupid tactics that evidently work.
[3292.74 --> 3293.74]  Hey, can you just stop that?
[3293.74 --> 3294.74]  What were you just saying?
[3294.74 --> 3295.74]  What were you saying?
[3295.74 --> 3296.74]  I was saying your...
[3296.74 --> 3297.74]  What were you saying?
[3297.74 --> 3298.74]  What were you just saying?
[3298.74 --> 3300.74]  I said your cheap, stupid tactics.
[3300.74 --> 3302.74]  That's all this game's about.
[3302.74 --> 3304.74]  Someone's asking me for workout methods.
[3304.74 --> 3305.74]  I thought, at least.
[3305.74 --> 3308.74]  I think that is probably a mistake.
[3308.74 --> 3310.74]  Like, an actual error.
[3310.74 --> 3313.74]  Was it actually you?
[3313.74 --> 3314.74]  Or was it someone in the chat?
[3314.74 --> 3317.74]  No, someone in the chat was asking me for workout methods.
[3317.74 --> 3319.74]  But like, asking you specifically, not asking the chat.
[3319.74 --> 3320.74]  Okay.
[3320.74 --> 3321.74]  Yeah.
[3321.74 --> 3322.74]  That's probably the wrong thing to do.
[3322.74 --> 3323.74]  Yeah.
[3323.74 --> 3324.74]  Linus doesn't work out.
[3324.74 --> 3325.74]  He plays badminton.
[3325.74 --> 3326.74]  Which is a workout method, by the way.
[3326.74 --> 3327.74]  Which is a workout method, by the way.
[3327.74 --> 3329.74]  But like, if you want his workout tip, it's good for badminton.
[3329.74 --> 3330.74]  Yeah.
[3330.74 --> 3331.74]  They'll play badminton and get good at it.
[3331.74 --> 3332.74]  Someone's like, Linus, do you even lift?
[3332.74 --> 3333.74]  Yes.
[3333.74 --> 3334.74]  No.
[3334.74 --> 3335.74]  I think it's just like, you know, what I'm saying is, have a baby.
[3335.74 --> 3336.74]  I lift my baby.
[3336.74 --> 3337.74]  Daddy arms.
[3337.74 --> 3338.74]  Daddy arms are a thing.
[3338.74 --> 3339.74]  Daddy arms are a definite thing.
[3339.74 --> 3342.74]  Anyone who thinks daddy arms are not a thing is wrong.
[3342.74 --> 3346.74]  And plumber arms, apparently, because my dad's a beast.
[3346.74 --> 3350.74]  Well, I think anyone who really works manually in a big way.
[3350.74 --> 3351.74]  See, isn't this frustrating?
[3351.74 --> 3352.74]  Isn't this frustrating?
[3352.74 --> 3353.74]  Isn't that frustrating?
[3353.74 --> 3354.74]  You like that?
[3354.74 --> 3355.74]  You like that?
[3355.74 --> 3356.74]  No!
[3356.74 --> 3357.74]  No!
[3357.74 --> 3358.74]  Yeah!
[3358.74 --> 3359.74]  Flying punch!
[3359.74 --> 3360.74]  And...
[3360.74 --> 3361.74]  Punch to the face.
[3361.74 --> 3362.74]  Punch to the face.
[3362.74 --> 3363.74]  Yes!
[3363.74 --> 3364.74]  The best fatality ever.
[3364.74 --> 3365.74]  Left jab.
[3365.74 --> 3366.74]  I jumped vertically instead of over.
[3366.74 --> 3367.74]  No.
[3367.74 --> 3368.74]  Okay.
[3368.74 --> 3369.74]  And the kill streak is broken.
[3369.74 --> 3370.74]  So I'm going back to...
[3370.74 --> 3371.74]  I'm going back to...
[3371.74 --> 3372.74]  I'm going...
[3372.74 --> 3373.74]  You know, I'm going back to Sub-Zero.
[3373.74 --> 3374.74]  I have now...
[3374.74 --> 3375.74]  This will be...
[3375.74 --> 3376.74]  I have played every single person this round.
[3376.74 --> 3377.74]  Okay.
[3377.74 --> 3378.74]  New champ.
[3378.74 --> 3379.74]  New champ.
[3379.74 --> 3380.74]  Being a new champ is better than being an old champ, because when you're an old champ,
[3380.74 --> 3381.74]  you're old.
[3381.74 --> 3382.74]  But you're old.
[3382.74 --> 3383.74]  And I'm dead.
[3383.74 --> 3384.74]  Is that why you don't like being an old champ?
[3384.74 --> 3385.74]  Is it because you have the experience of being an old champ?
[3385.74 --> 3386.74]  Is that why you don't like being an old champ?
[3386.74 --> 3388.74]  Is it because you have the experience of being an old champ?
[3388.74 --> 3389.74]  There it is!
[3389.74 --> 3391.74]  Okay, now I have to replicate that.
[3391.74 --> 3392.74]  What?
[3392.74 --> 3393.74]  Neither of us moved!
[3393.74 --> 3395.74]  That is such BS.
[3395.74 --> 3396.74]  Oh my gosh.
[3396.74 --> 3397.74]  I don't know if you have the chance to get up.
[3397.74 --> 3398.74]  I'm just kidding.
[3398.74 --> 3399.74]  That was a bad trick!
[3399.74 --> 3400.74]  In the last time I had to go.
[3400.74 --> 3401.74]  You don't know what I had to go.
[3401.74 --> 3402.74]  There it is!
[3402.74 --> 3403.74]  I think that's...
[3403.74 --> 3404.74]  You're old.
[3404.74 --> 3405.74]  You're old.
[3405.74 --> 3406.74]  Oh my gosh.
[3406.74 --> 3407.74]  I know.
[3407.74 --> 3408.74]  You're old.
[3408.74 --> 3409.74]  You're old.
[3409.74 --> 3410.74]  But you're old.
[3410.74 --> 3411.74]  And I'm dead.
[3411.74 --> 3413.74]  Is that why you don't like being an old champ?
[3413.74 --> 3414.74]  Is it because you have the experience of being old already?
[3414.74 --> 3415.74]  There it is!
[3415.74 --> 3417.74]  Okay, well, now I have to replicate that.
[3417.74 --> 3422.02]  Oh, come on!
[3423.10 --> 3423.92]  Serious question.
[3424.06 --> 3426.42]  Why don't you unbox and review Asrock Motherboards?
[3426.48 --> 3427.52]  They get good ratings all the time.
[3428.04 --> 3431.76]  We actually just had a pretty good meeting with Asrock at Computex,
[3432.02 --> 3432.98]  so who knows?
[3433.04 --> 3435.18]  You might see some Asrock Motherboard videos on our channel.
[3436.00 --> 3441.48]  But the situation before was just that we didn't really have an existing relationship with them.
[3441.48 --> 3449.12]  I think Uppercut's the only move we can execute consistently.
[3450.44 --> 3452.46]  I'm not even necessarily sure what it is.
[3452.56 --> 3453.48]  I just kind of think I know.
[3453.48 --> 3455.14]  Apparently, whatever you're doing blocks it.
[3455.90 --> 3456.12]  Really?
[3456.52 --> 3457.76]  Well, yeah, because there's like...
[3457.76 --> 3458.56]  It punches faster.
[3458.76 --> 3459.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[3459.32 --> 3459.86]  That makes sense.
[3461.54 --> 3462.54]  Oh, come on!
[3462.56 --> 3465.48]  I have a terrible...
[3466.00 --> 3468.56]  I have a terrible record here.
[3469.06 --> 3470.80]  Someone says Slick looks like Johnny Cage.
[3470.80 --> 3472.02]  What was that, being about a new champ?
[3472.30 --> 3475.12]  Something about new champ being better...
[3475.12 --> 3477.60]  Yeah, it's better than being an old champ, but I wasn't even an old champ.
[3477.66 --> 3478.38]  I was never a champ.
[3479.34 --> 3480.12]  So, yeah.
[3480.14 --> 3481.10]  You were a new champ, weren't you?
[3481.20 --> 3483.00]  Okay, I want to shoot the ice thing again.
[3483.12 --> 3483.98]  I want to hit you this time.
[3484.02 --> 3484.94]  I don't know who I want to play.
[3485.02 --> 3485.52]  I've played everyone.
[3486.00 --> 3486.56]  Who should I play?
[3486.96 --> 3487.40]  Twitch chat.
[3488.46 --> 3490.14]  You know, there's like a five-second delay
[3490.14 --> 3492.38]  while everyone gets to wait for you to read the thing.
[3492.54 --> 3493.28]  Wait for it.
[3493.30 --> 3494.74]  Cage looks like Rick Astley.
[3494.86 --> 3495.10]  Kano?
[3496.00 --> 3496.98]  Actually, kind of.
[3497.24 --> 3497.52]  Raiden.
[3498.10 --> 3498.42]  Scorpion.
[3499.08 --> 3499.80]  Sonia, the girl.
[3499.80 --> 3501.70]  It's tied between like a lot of people.
[3502.02 --> 3502.30]  Yeah.
[3502.64 --> 3503.84]  Someone says play my genitals.
[3504.02 --> 3505.38]  Okay, the most I got was Sonia.
[3505.80 --> 3506.16]  Okay.
[3507.06 --> 3507.74]  In a row.
[3507.92 --> 3510.00]  The most I got in a row was Sonia, which was two.
[3510.44 --> 3510.74]  Okay.
[3510.86 --> 3512.16]  But I don't know who else to count it.
[3512.16 --> 3514.16]  Well, getting two Sonias in a row couldn't be a bad thing.
[3516.24 --> 3516.60]  Yeah.
[3521.44 --> 3522.08]  Go away.
[3522.08 --> 3525.50]  Why are you so aggressive?
[3526.00 --> 3526.82]  Why not?
[3526.88 --> 3528.08]  It's a fighting game.
[3528.14 --> 3529.70]  I want to punch you in the face.
[3530.34 --> 3530.68]  That's the boy.
[3530.68 --> 3532.06]  Why do you want to punch me in the face?
[3532.08 --> 3533.56]  Because it's a fighting game.
[3533.88 --> 3535.40]  You don't play fighting games right.
[3536.18 --> 3537.46]  But I'm killing you.
[3537.88 --> 3538.12]  No.
[3541.12 --> 3542.90]  Someone says, geez, this bores me.
[3542.98 --> 3544.04]  Do Mario Kart already.
[3544.36 --> 3547.34]  I don't see how Mario Kart is going to be more interesting than this.
[3547.34 --> 3551.98]  It's going to be just me owning Slick as hard as he's owning me right now.
[3552.30 --> 3552.64]  Yeah.
[3552.84 --> 3555.78]  Is there a game that we could actually be equally good at?
[3556.46 --> 3557.48]  I don't think so.
[3558.86 --> 3560.34]  What about like...
[3560.34 --> 3561.04]  Oh.
[3562.46 --> 3563.58]  No, the timing.
[3563.76 --> 3563.96]  No.
[3564.14 --> 3564.58]  Yes.
[3565.10 --> 3565.66]  What about what?
[3565.76 --> 3567.34]  What about like...
[3568.00 --> 3573.94]  For like almost every game, it's either single player or one of us has played it more than
[3573.94 --> 3574.42]  the other one.
[3575.08 --> 3576.90]  By like a lot, not a little bit.
[3576.90 --> 3580.06]  Well, we could do like a co-op side-scroller game, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or
[3580.06 --> 3580.28]  something.
[3580.42 --> 3583.96]  We could do anything co-op, but you like doing competitive stuff.
[3584.48 --> 3586.66]  Well, I think competitive is more interesting to watch.
[3587.68 --> 3589.04]  It's like watching people cooperate.
[3589.54 --> 3589.66]  Yeah.
[3589.80 --> 3594.20]  Let's have a new form of Olympics where it's like the Cooperation Olympiad.
[3597.80 --> 3598.54]  The Cooperation Olympiad?
[3598.54 --> 3599.28]  Who would watch that?
[3600.68 --> 3603.06]  I guess there's competitive co-op.
[3603.60 --> 3604.46]  Competitive co-op?
[3604.46 --> 3607.62]  Well, there's some Olympics groups, which is multiple people per team, but there's multiple
[3607.62 --> 3607.98]  teams.
[3608.78 --> 3609.40]  Go, go, go, go.
[3609.40 --> 3610.24]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[3610.44 --> 3610.76]  Oh, wait.
[3610.78 --> 3611.04]  I'm out?
[3611.14 --> 3611.48]  It's done?
[3612.24 --> 3613.24]  I maxed out already.
[3613.64 --> 3614.46]  Did I...
[3614.46 --> 3616.16]  I can't even get into the line.
[3616.26 --> 3617.10]  We suck.
[3617.56 --> 3618.58]  We're terrible.
[3618.58 --> 3621.04]  90s gamers were so much better than us.
[3621.04 --> 3621.54]  Oh, I know.
[3621.78 --> 3623.24]  Someone says play Goof Troop together.
[3623.42 --> 3624.60]  Actually, that's an awesome game.
[3624.66 --> 3625.30]  Did you ever play Goof Troop?
[3625.32 --> 3626.04]  I've never played Goof Troop.
[3626.22 --> 3627.96]  It's surprisingly good.
[3628.02 --> 3628.22]  Okay.
[3628.52 --> 3629.60]  Last match, I get Raiden.
[3631.18 --> 3632.76]  I don't know who to play.
[3633.64 --> 3634.60]  You can play Raiden, too.
[3634.92 --> 3636.46]  I'll tell you the move, and then it can be equal.
[3637.62 --> 3638.30]  What is it?
[3638.52 --> 3639.40]  It's back, back, forward.
[3641.28 --> 3642.36]  That's what I like about it.
[3642.36 --> 3643.36]  It's so quick to execute.
[3643.68 --> 3643.88]  Nah.
[3644.24 --> 3644.68]  Really?
[3644.96 --> 3645.28]  Yeah.
[3645.46 --> 3646.92]  Because you know I'm going to totally own you.
[3646.92 --> 3648.98]  But playing two of the same person is boring.
[3649.92 --> 3650.32]  Really?
[3650.60 --> 3650.92]  Yeah.
[3651.20 --> 3651.64]  How so?
[3651.70 --> 3653.88]  Because you're equally pitted against each other.
[3653.96 --> 3654.54]  Mirror matches.
[3654.74 --> 3655.88]  I'm not too into mirror matches.
[3656.70 --> 3656.98]  What?
[3657.06 --> 3658.96]  I watch too much Starcraft to enjoy mirror matches.
[3660.40 --> 3661.64]  Because I'm just going to do this.
[3670.22 --> 3671.50]  I can dance all day!
[3672.72 --> 3673.62]  What was that?
[3673.88 --> 3674.48]  I don't know!
[3675.04 --> 3675.74]  Well, there you go.
[3676.08 --> 3676.48]  Boom!
[3679.84 --> 3680.24]  Whoops.
[3682.30 --> 3682.70]  Whatever.
[3682.88 --> 3684.64]  I hardcore uppercutted before you did that.
[3685.74 --> 3686.30]  There we go.
[3686.30 --> 3686.36]  No!
[3686.76 --> 3687.16]  Raiden!
[3687.30 --> 3688.00]  I got to get halves.
[3688.20 --> 3689.10]  That was better than I did before.
[3689.40 --> 3689.88]  That's true.
[3689.96 --> 3691.58]  I had a flawless victory the first time.
[3691.60 --> 3691.76]  Yeah.
[3692.08 --> 3696.10]  Which is kind of cheap, because if you don't know any combos, it's basically like having
[3696.10 --> 3697.52]  a tiger fight against a bunny.
[3698.52 --> 3699.80]  I mean, it's entertaining, but...
[3699.80 --> 3701.42]  I also don't know any combos right now, though.
[3701.42 --> 3705.36]  No, I mean, but yeah, but I only know one.
[3705.56 --> 3706.88]  I don't know what else to do.
[3707.16 --> 3707.42]  Can I even...
[3709.94 --> 3712.50]  Oh, you executed a little faster than me.
[3713.50 --> 3713.84]  There we go.
[3713.84 --> 3714.98]  Oh, that was nasty.
[3715.64 --> 3715.86]  There.
[3716.00 --> 3716.14]  Oh.
[3717.18 --> 3717.50]  Oh.
[3718.14 --> 3718.94]  Oh, yeah.
[3718.94 --> 3720.76]  Your recovery time from that's so fast, too.
[3720.76 --> 3721.18]  Oh, I know.
[3721.36 --> 3722.08]  It's like stupid.
[3722.08 --> 3722.10]  What?
[3725.74 --> 3726.18]  Man.
[3726.32 --> 3726.76]  There we go.
[3726.94 --> 3727.28]  Boom!
[3727.38 --> 3728.00]  That's nuts!
[3728.00 --> 3729.84]  And I can hit you when you're on the ground.
[3730.26 --> 3730.82]  Oh, oh, wow.
[3730.94 --> 3731.30]  Okay, okay.
[3731.32 --> 3731.56]  Hold on.
[3731.62 --> 3731.84]  Hold on.
[3731.94 --> 3732.34]  Fitting end.
[3732.36 --> 3732.60]  Can you do it?
[3732.92 --> 3733.34]  Oh, no!
[3733.40 --> 3734.54]  I wanted to monkey punch you!
[3734.82 --> 3735.18]  No!
[3739.90 --> 3740.90]  Oh, we tried.
[3741.06 --> 3741.98]  Oh, monkey punch.
[3742.06 --> 3744.20]  Monkey punch or just a single left hook.
[3744.50 --> 3745.72]  Both of those would have been perfect.
[3746.84 --> 3748.18]  That would have been way better.
[3749.06 --> 3749.50]  Oh, well.
[3749.56 --> 3751.12]  I wonder how many people are even watching.
[3752.68 --> 3753.04]  Okay.
[3753.24 --> 3754.78]  I don't know because I can't move this.
[3755.02 --> 3755.78]  Oh, 2,000.
[3756.04 --> 3757.70]  2,000 people are watching this?
[3758.20 --> 3758.56]  Apparently.
[3758.68 --> 3759.38]  I love you guys.
[3759.54 --> 3760.26]  That's awesome.
[3760.42 --> 3763.50]  Okay, let's go ahead and change games.
[3763.60 --> 3765.40]  So get the Twitch chat to vote.
[3765.68 --> 3766.10]  Oh, what?
[3766.84 --> 3767.20]  Huh?
[3767.68 --> 3768.24]  I already did it.
[3768.56 --> 3768.86]  Okay.
[3768.98 --> 3770.18]  Let's get some votes here, guys.
[3770.18 --> 3770.68]  Let's get some votes.
[3770.68 --> 3771.32]  What do you guys want to play?
[3771.38 --> 3772.20]  What do you guys want to see?
[3773.86 --> 3774.84]  Killer Instinct?
[3775.38 --> 3776.78]  That's just another fighting game, though.
[3777.42 --> 3778.14]  Metal Slug?
[3778.14 --> 3779.82]  I think that's another fighting game.
[3779.82 --> 3780.44]  Bummer Man.
[3780.62 --> 3782.10]  I want Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[3782.18 --> 3782.98]  We keep asking them.
[3783.16 --> 3784.30]  Then we just pick something.
[3786.24 --> 3788.08]  Okay, blow it out before you put it in.
[3788.74 --> 3789.10]  Okay.
[3789.30 --> 3790.32]  It's probably old.
[3790.82 --> 3792.00]  And probably hasn't been done.
[3792.02 --> 3793.24]  We want Turtles in Time, right?
[3794.16 --> 3794.60]  I don't know.
[3794.60 --> 3796.16]  I think I have that one, so.
[3796.94 --> 3797.36]  I can't.
[3797.46 --> 3798.42]  I don't think I've played it.
[3798.88 --> 3799.92]  You don't think you've played it?
[3800.08 --> 3800.44]  Oh, it's okay.
[3800.48 --> 3801.08]  It's a co-op game.
[3801.26 --> 3801.54]  Sweet.
[3801.64 --> 3802.16]  So you'll be fine.
[3802.80 --> 3803.38]  I might have.
[3803.46 --> 3806.78]  Is this one where you go to the Apple right away?
[3807.16 --> 3808.06]  New York Apple or whatever?
[3808.44 --> 3808.96]  I have no idea.
[3810.34 --> 3811.60]  I'll know once we get in.
[3811.78 --> 3814.16]  I've played a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[3814.20 --> 3815.86]  I haven't played this game for a long time.
[3815.86 --> 3816.68]  Someone said Sims.
[3817.06 --> 3818.10]  Oh, my God.
[3818.10 --> 3818.50]  Sims.
[3819.56 --> 3821.72]  I play Sims, and we'll both become computers people.
[3821.82 --> 3822.66]  I'm so sweaty.
[3822.74 --> 3823.12]  It's gross.
[3823.18 --> 3824.30]  It is disgusting in here.
[3824.40 --> 3824.92]  I have to pee.
[3825.14 --> 3825.78]  Do you want to make the game started?
[3825.78 --> 3825.84]  Do you want to make the game started?
[3825.84 --> 3825.86]  Do you want to make the game started?
[3825.86 --> 3825.88]  Do you want to make the game started?
[3825.88 --> 3825.90]  Do you want to make the game started?
[3825.90 --> 3825.96]  Do you want to make the game started?
[3825.96 --> 3827.84]  Oh, okay.
[3828.04 --> 3828.42]  There you go.
[3828.94 --> 3829.92]  It's probably fairly self-school.
[3829.92 --> 3831.34]  I actually don't know how easy it's going to be.
[3831.34 --> 3832.28]  Castle Crashers.
[3832.34 --> 3833.28]  That would be pretty cool.
[3833.28 --> 3834.70]  Oh, hold on.
[3834.84 --> 3836.86]  We should show them the state of this room right now.
[3836.96 --> 3837.70]  I'll use the webcam.
[3838.58 --> 3840.34]  Because the webcam's, like, on the floor.
[3840.50 --> 3841.48]  Switch to scene 12.
[3841.94 --> 3843.58]  Oh, but you have to add...
[3843.58 --> 3844.28]  Add, um...
[3853.18 --> 3853.54]  Okay.
[3854.10 --> 3854.46]  Okay.
[3854.46 --> 3855.88]  Can I make the thing small?
[3856.02 --> 3856.40]  There we go.
[3856.44 --> 3857.26]  Where is it?
[3858.14 --> 3858.58]  It's on the floor somewhere.
[3858.58 --> 3860.78]  It's looking at cables and a chair wheel.
[3860.92 --> 3862.16]  Yeah, but that could be anywhere.
[3862.18 --> 3862.56]  Chair wheel.
[3862.56 --> 3863.64]  Chair wheel?
[3863.80 --> 3864.00]  Yeah.
[3864.26 --> 3864.52]  Yeah.
[3864.72 --> 3865.48]  Like the rolly chair.
[3865.68 --> 3866.16]  Like the...
[3866.16 --> 3867.32]  Well, I'm at the rolly chair.
[3867.40 --> 3867.64]  I don't see...
[3867.64 --> 3868.22]  Oh, here it is.
[3868.26 --> 3868.54]  Here it is.
[3868.56 --> 3868.90]  I got it.
[3869.88 --> 3870.24]  Yeah.
[3871.30 --> 3871.66]  Okay.
[3872.02 --> 3872.44]  Hey, everyone.
[3873.12 --> 3875.22]  So, this is the state of our streaming room.
[3875.38 --> 3879.84]  If you're wondering why it takes us so long to switch things around, it's because we can
[3879.84 --> 3880.96]  hardly move in here.
[3882.04 --> 3882.62]  Hold on.
[3882.70 --> 3883.00]  Hold on.
[3883.32 --> 3884.00]  Shakey cam.
[3884.20 --> 3884.76]  Shakey cam.
[3884.88 --> 3885.58]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[3886.16 --> 3886.70]  I'm sorry.
[3886.84 --> 3888.20]  Do you have WDM2 in the background?
[3888.30 --> 3888.84]  Yeah, it's there.
[3888.92 --> 3889.14]  Okay.
[3889.36 --> 3890.06]  What movie is this?
[3890.24 --> 3890.56]  Cloverfield.
[3890.56 --> 3892.20]  Okay.
[3892.48 --> 3893.26]  So, here's our light.
[3893.48 --> 3895.24]  Let me know if I'm, like, pointing at the right stuff.
[3895.54 --> 3896.00]  Yep, light.
[3896.18 --> 3896.30]  Yep.
[3896.30 --> 3897.46]  Here's our stream camera.
[3897.66 --> 3897.86]  Yep.
[3898.62 --> 3898.98]  Okay.
[3899.42 --> 3900.12]  Here, okay.
[3900.32 --> 3902.66]  So, this is the monitor for the live stream.
[3903.58 --> 3903.90]  Okay?
[3903.98 --> 3905.02]  For monitoring the live stream.
[3905.08 --> 3905.30]  See it?
[3905.34 --> 3906.48]  We got Razercoms over there.
[3906.54 --> 3907.06]  We got all that.
[3907.06 --> 3910.40]  This is our CRT that we use to play, so there's no input lag.
[3910.86 --> 3917.16]  This is the computer we're running our SNES hooked up to the Aver Media Capture card, which
[3917.16 --> 3917.94]  of course would work.
[3918.50 --> 3920.12]  The SNES is under the table.
[3920.12 --> 3921.08]  The SNES is under the table.
[3921.50 --> 3924.34]  That's my Aspire S7 that I use to monitor Twitch chat.
[3924.92 --> 3927.30]  There's Slick's Bamboo that he uses to monitor Twitch chat.
[3927.30 --> 3930.58]  So, that's at least four computers.
[3931.32 --> 3933.44]  And then on top of that, this is Slick's test bench room.
[3933.56 --> 3938.82]  So, there's a bench, bench, bench, and thermal test bench.
[3938.88 --> 3939.74]  I really have to pee now.
[3939.80 --> 3941.20]  So, we're in the third floor of a house.
[3941.76 --> 3944.24]  So, heat is definitely up here.
[3944.50 --> 3945.74]  It's super hot today.
[3945.74 --> 3950.10]  And there's all this stuff in here generating heat, like the lights in there.
[3950.10 --> 3951.94]  And CRTs are kind of a problem with that.
[3952.30 --> 3954.02]  Yeah, and CRTs are not so good at that.
[3954.56 --> 3955.98]  Two players versus...
[3955.98 --> 3956.72]  What?
[3957.92 --> 3959.02]  Two players...
[3959.02 --> 3960.48]  Oh, these are four different options.
[3960.66 --> 3960.80]  Okay.
[3961.38 --> 3961.78]  Two players.
[3965.00 --> 3966.34]  I think I've played this one.
[3967.00 --> 3968.40]  Pretty sure I've played this one.
[3970.08 --> 3971.28]  Which one do I want to be?
[3975.74 --> 3978.16]  This guy.
[3978.60 --> 3979.94]  Oh, that's not my controller.
[3980.64 --> 3980.96]  This guy.
[3982.88 --> 3983.54]  Battle toads?
[3983.60 --> 3984.34]  That's not a bad idea.
[3985.16 --> 3989.92]  Hey, if I didn't wash my hands when I went to the bathroom, and I took one of your Twizzlers,
[3990.08 --> 3990.96]  could I have the rest of them?
[3991.26 --> 3992.02]  There's no more Twizzlers.
[3992.24 --> 3992.66]  Oh, okay.
[3992.76 --> 3993.12]  Ha-ha!
[3994.30 --> 3995.44]  I guess the joke's on me.
[3995.46 --> 3995.94]  Is it still on?
[3996.30 --> 3996.84]  I think so.
[3996.94 --> 3997.28]  Oh, okay.
[3997.52 --> 3998.30]  Then there's our mic.
[3998.46 --> 3999.86]  Oh, I guess I could have switched streams.
[4000.02 --> 4002.22]  See, there's our mic attached to a C-stand.
[4005.74 --> 4006.72]  Okay, I'm coming back.
[4007.56 --> 4010.38]  Scene one, scene two, scene three, scene three.
[4010.64 --> 4011.20]  Scene four.
[4011.60 --> 4012.00]  Scene four?
[4012.22 --> 4012.42]  Yeah.
[4012.76 --> 4013.06]  Scene four.
[4013.18 --> 4016.06]  Scene four is a very slightly edited version of scene three.
[4016.20 --> 4016.90]  Well, whatever, man.
[4017.56 --> 4018.86]  Um, okay.
[4019.10 --> 4019.44]  What?
[4019.62 --> 4020.34]  You're Donatello?
[4022.28 --> 4023.40]  I want to be Donatello.
[4023.72 --> 4024.00]  What?
[4024.24 --> 4026.36]  Well, Leonardo's the leader anyway, so I guess I should be Leonardo.
[4027.74 --> 4028.86]  Ha-ha-ha.
[4028.86 --> 4034.08]  So, do you think they've clued in as to why we keep asking them what game we should play
[4034.08 --> 4035.46]  and then just playing whatever game anyway?
[4036.02 --> 4037.84]  It's because we only have certain games?
[4037.90 --> 4038.10]  Yeah.
[4038.42 --> 4039.78]  For our Super Nintendo?
[4040.10 --> 4041.86]  When people suggest games, we might not own it.
[4042.18 --> 4042.44]  Yeah.
[4042.98 --> 4044.34]  And that would be a big problem.
[4044.76 --> 4045.88]  So, you recognize this game, right?
[4046.30 --> 4047.20]  Yes, yes, I've played this.
[4047.66 --> 4047.96]  Okay.
[4048.12 --> 4048.22]  Yeah.
[4048.78 --> 4049.34]  Let's jump.
[4049.48 --> 4050.18]  Okay, here we go.
[4050.26 --> 4051.02]  Ah, there we go.
[4051.08 --> 4051.46]  There we go.
[4051.46 --> 4053.84]  It's all about the jump kick for this game.
[4053.84 --> 4063.52]  See, I'm going to get so confused because I've, like, never played as anyone other than Donatello.
[4063.76 --> 4063.98]  Oh.
[4072.72 --> 4074.14]  Is it all about that thing?
[4074.74 --> 4075.28]  Which one?
[4075.54 --> 4078.86]  The, when you, like, get them stuck on your weapon and flop them back and forth.
[4078.96 --> 4080.16]  No, because it takes too long.
[4080.16 --> 4083.96]  So, it locks you in one spot to a certain extent as well.
[4085.22 --> 4087.14]  Right, but then you're creaming everyone around you.
[4087.30 --> 4090.90]  Right, but the, uh, the, uh, the flying kick, I think, is a two-hit kill.
[4091.40 --> 4092.86]  So, you only have to hit them twice.
[4093.02 --> 4096.86]  And it also takes them out of the fight while they're, like, falling away.
[4097.14 --> 4099.18]  So, you can just, like, run around and do that.
[4099.54 --> 4101.70]  And then it just kind of owns them pretty good.
[4102.08 --> 4103.24]  Oh, wow.
[4103.42 --> 4104.88]  You lose a lot of health for that, I think.
[4105.76 --> 4106.24]  I'm getting rekt.
[4106.24 --> 4107.22]  You're getting hit by the wrecking ball.
[4108.36 --> 4109.32]  Yeah, I got rekt.
[4109.32 --> 4110.44]  Have you, like...
[4110.44 --> 4110.88]  I got wrecking ball.
[4112.46 --> 4114.44]  You got wrecked by the wrecking ball?
[4115.38 --> 4116.04]  Yeah, yeah.
[4116.64 --> 4117.92]  Like a boss.
[4118.76 --> 4121.18]  Like a, like a wrecking boss.
[4121.80 --> 4123.60]  Like a wrecking boss.
[4124.96 --> 4125.28]  Yeah.
[4126.56 --> 4130.80]  And the other thing, too, is, uh, particularly later on, I think they use them more, but they
[4130.80 --> 4134.48]  have flying attacks that they can come in and mess you up when you're holding still for
[4134.48 --> 4134.96]  a long time.
[4135.20 --> 4135.76]  Pizza, pizza!
[4136.48 --> 4137.86]  Did you just eat the pizza?
[4137.86 --> 4138.30]  Pizza?
[4138.30 --> 4138.48]  I didn't...
[4138.48 --> 4139.48]  You have full health.
[4139.48 --> 4140.38]  I didn't mean to.
[4140.88 --> 4141.66]  You have...
[4141.66 --> 4142.68]  I didn't mean to.
[4143.58 --> 4144.28]  Do you know how rare...
[4144.28 --> 4146.10]  I was just jumping and doing this thing.
[4146.16 --> 4147.94]  Do you know how rare health is in this game?
[4149.54 --> 4150.42]  Whoa, that's cool.
[4150.78 --> 4151.10]  Oh, yeah.
[4151.14 --> 4154.24]  That's the other thing about the flying kick is you can take out, like, five guys at
[4154.24 --> 4155.24]  once if they're all in one place.
[4156.00 --> 4157.18]  Oh, how do you do the throw?
[4157.24 --> 4157.78]  I don't remember.
[4157.92 --> 4158.10]  I don't...
[4158.10 --> 4160.62]  I think it's just spamming attack and it's a chance, isn't it?
[4161.02 --> 4161.92]  I don't think so.
[4161.92 --> 4163.98]  I just did it twice, so I'm pretty sure.
[4164.88 --> 4165.42]  Oh, okay.
[4166.24 --> 4166.78]  Oh, right.
[4166.88 --> 4168.60]  And then when they're frozen, I think you can, like...
[4168.60 --> 4169.38]  Yeah, there, that one.
[4169.60 --> 4171.20]  And that one does splash damage.
[4171.20 --> 4172.04]  That's what I was saying, though.
[4172.08 --> 4174.26]  When you whack them back and forth, isn't that good?
[4174.34 --> 4175.28]  That's what I meant, was...
[4175.28 --> 4175.60]  Oh!
[4176.18 --> 4176.62]  That's...
[4176.62 --> 4177.76]  When you, like, flop them.
[4178.00 --> 4180.06]  Oh, you wanted to know about whacking them back and forth.
[4181.78 --> 4184.12]  I don't know how to differentiate between the moves, man.
[4184.12 --> 4187.86]  You mean that whacking back and forth.
[4188.14 --> 4190.96]  Not the other, more different whacking back and forth.
[4191.54 --> 4191.94]  Whacking.
[4196.06 --> 4197.62]  Don't your parents still watch this stream?
[4197.84 --> 4198.04]  Yep.
[4198.36 --> 4198.56]  Yeah.
[4199.66 --> 4200.54]  What the heck?
[4200.60 --> 4201.58]  Why can't I do it anymore?
[4201.80 --> 4202.30]  There we go.
[4203.58 --> 4204.40]  Doesn't this guy shoot us?
[4204.40 --> 4204.88]  Don't get hit by the lasers.
[4205.34 --> 4205.54]  Whoops.
[4205.54 --> 4206.60]  I almost got hit by the lasers.
[4206.60 --> 4207.56]  Is it, like, insta-kill?
[4208.12 --> 4209.02]  No, it's just...
[4209.02 --> 4209.42]  Yeah, that.
[4209.76 --> 4210.54]  And I'm dead.
[4212.12 --> 4213.84]  Oh, that's all it's good.
[4214.12 --> 4214.60]  Wow.
[4214.78 --> 4215.14]  Oh, shoot.
[4215.26 --> 4215.94]  I was stuck.
[4216.38 --> 4217.98]  You can save me when I'm stuck, by the way.
[4218.14 --> 4218.40]  Okay.
[4218.78 --> 4219.52]  If you want to.
[4219.54 --> 4220.40]  Just hit the guys that are grabbing me?
[4220.58 --> 4220.80]  Yeah.
[4223.08 --> 4224.02]  Defending my honor.
[4227.52 --> 4230.72]  I don't like that one.
[4231.38 --> 4232.04]  Which one?
[4233.48 --> 4234.30]  The jump ship?
[4234.30 --> 4235.54]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4236.08 --> 4237.72]  Oh, that one's for stars.
[4239.30 --> 4240.86]  I've never actually beat this game.
[4241.82 --> 4242.86]  I don't know if I have.
[4242.90 --> 4243.50]  I didn't own it.
[4243.50 --> 4245.50]  I played it as a friend's host, like, once or twice.
[4245.50 --> 4247.40]  Based on how good you are at it, you haven't beat it either.
[4247.66 --> 4247.90]  No.
[4248.36 --> 4249.08]  Like, it's...
[4249.08 --> 4250.36]  Actually, yeah, I did.
[4251.24 --> 4252.24]  Did you use cheats, though?
[4252.48 --> 4252.76]  Nope.
[4252.88 --> 4254.12]  Or did you have, like, a lead friend?
[4254.12 --> 4255.00]  I think I had a lead friend.
[4255.14 --> 4255.66]  Yeah, okay.
[4256.32 --> 4257.42]  I don't know if that...
[4257.42 --> 4257.62]  Okay.
[4258.00 --> 4258.36]  So, here.
[4258.62 --> 4260.44]  Let's get the Twitch chat's take on this.
[4260.62 --> 4263.90]  Did you beat a game if you were there while a lead friend...
[4263.90 --> 4264.46]  If you got carried.
[4264.46 --> 4265.56]  ...beat it, basically.
[4265.56 --> 4265.74]  If you got carried.
[4265.74 --> 4266.24]  Yeah.
[4266.24 --> 4268.04]  And...
[4268.04 --> 4268.78]  Did you watch?
[4272.78 --> 4274.16]  I think I might have been okay.
[4275.16 --> 4275.50]  Oh!
[4275.50 --> 4276.56]  Oh, wait.
[4276.62 --> 4278.20]  No, you should have taken the pizza that time.
[4278.30 --> 4279.22]  Okay, that was my bad.
[4279.22 --> 4283.68]  It's hard to, uh...
[4283.68 --> 4286.60]  It's hard to monitor Twitch chat when...
[4286.60 --> 4288.20]  When there's just constant fighting?
[4288.98 --> 4289.64]  Yeah, when there's...
[4289.64 --> 4292.60]  And I think they're just spamming that stupid thing right now.
[4292.60 --> 4293.44]  Raise your donors.
[4294.22 --> 4294.82]  That's cool.
[4295.88 --> 4296.68]  Yeah, that's kind of annoying.
[4297.00 --> 4303.00]  Uh, guys, anytime that happens in the chat, uh, the mods have full go-ahead to just turn on subscriber-only mode.
[4303.06 --> 4304.24]  Because it's just kind of annoying.
[4304.48 --> 4304.88]  Ah!
[4305.30 --> 4305.96]  So, yeah.
[4306.14 --> 4308.18]  That's not gonna be a thing in our Twitch chat.
[4308.18 --> 4309.52]  At all.
[4311.18 --> 4314.14]  You know, that's always something that I kind of wondered about.
[4314.48 --> 4317.18]  Like, on the home console version of these arcade games...
[4318.06 --> 4320.18]  Why they don't just...
[4321.10 --> 4322.76]  The bosses.
[4322.96 --> 4323.92]  The bosses are the killer.
[4324.64 --> 4325.22]  In this game.
[4326.30 --> 4328.18]  Uh, but why they don't just, um...
[4329.56 --> 4331.26]  Let you have as many lives as you want.
[4332.00 --> 4332.58]  Because it's...
[4332.58 --> 4333.68]  Like, otherwise you just...
[4333.68 --> 4334.80]  You have no choice at all.
[4335.40 --> 4336.44]  So what are you supposed to do?
[4338.18 --> 4339.84]  And I love how the hit bar...
[4339.84 --> 4340.46]  The, uh...
[4340.46 --> 4342.14]  The life bars for him are just...
[4342.14 --> 4343.14]  Completely meaningless.
[4345.84 --> 4346.16]  Woo!
[4350.82 --> 4353.68]  It's really hard to tell where people are, like, aiming and stuff.
[4354.34 --> 4355.28]  I remember that.
[4355.28 --> 4361.06]  What the heck is that thing supposed to be?
[4361.96 --> 4364.66]  Like, what the heck is that?
[4366.24 --> 4366.96]  There we go.
[4367.90 --> 4370.44]  And I love how they can just break stun locks.
[4370.96 --> 4371.78]  Just every time.
[4372.10 --> 4373.44]  And we just can't at all.
[4373.88 --> 4376.38]  And I think that thing takes off, like, a full two bars.
[4376.58 --> 4377.72]  Or, like, two or something.
[4377.94 --> 4380.76]  And I thought I was you for a bit there, so I had no idea what was going on.
[4380.76 --> 4384.94]  Yeah, that's kind of annoying, Baxter.
[4385.32 --> 4388.50]  You know, I think I have a Baxter action figure somewhere.
[4389.50 --> 4389.90]  Yeah.
[4390.34 --> 4390.98]  Well, why not?
[4391.78 --> 4392.40]  Oh, yeah, he's dead.
[4392.64 --> 4393.26]  He's dead.
[4393.34 --> 4394.22]  Because he's, like, a...
[4394.22 --> 4394.52]  Bud.
[4399.16 --> 4400.58]  What CRT is that?
[4400.72 --> 4404.58]  It's an LG Flatron T910 BU.
[4404.58 --> 4407.74]  Oh, yeah, we got it for free.
[4412.66 --> 4416.10]  Yep, runes now in subscriber-only mode.
[4416.50 --> 4416.90]  Bam!
[4417.48 --> 4418.42]  We hate doing that.
[4418.58 --> 4422.18]  And we generally actually tell our Twitch mods to never, ever do that,
[4422.22 --> 4423.04]  because it's terrible.
[4423.30 --> 4428.14]  But if you guys are just going to spam, raise your dongers, then...
[4428.14 --> 4429.76]  Yeah, it's just kind of annoying for everyone.
[4429.92 --> 4430.42]  So, yeah.
[4431.06 --> 4432.10]  We're kind of done with that.
[4432.74 --> 4433.60]  Can you break these?
[4433.60 --> 4434.00]  Yeah.
[4435.12 --> 4436.22]  Is it every time you hit it?
[4436.30 --> 4436.56]  Nope.
[4436.86 --> 4440.60]  It's probably, like, a physics-based mechanism.
[4441.00 --> 4441.44]  Oh, sorry.
[4441.94 --> 4442.94]  I was trying to save you.
[4443.48 --> 4446.26]  I was trying to defend your honor from the guys who were grabbing you.
[4447.76 --> 4448.40]  Wearing purple.
[4451.18 --> 4451.54]  Jumpsuits.
[4452.54 --> 4453.70]  They're kind of ninjas.
[4453.70 --> 4459.70]  You know, I am surprised that that's not really much more of a thing than it is.
[4459.70 --> 4462.16]  Cosplaying as...
[4462.16 --> 4462.24]  Cosplaying as...
[4462.24 --> 4463.94]  Oh, what are they?
[4464.00 --> 4464.40]  Foot soldiers.
[4466.84 --> 4467.88]  That's what they were called, right?
[4468.18 --> 4468.52]  The foot?
[4469.80 --> 4470.14]  Maybe.
[4471.30 --> 4472.16]  I don't remember now.
[4472.16 --> 4474.18]  Like, where do you get a foot soldier outfit?
[4475.48 --> 4476.54]  It's pretty simple.
[4476.96 --> 4478.30]  I know, but, like, I've never seen one.
[4478.30 --> 4479.08]  Pretty sure you can just make your own.
[4479.50 --> 4480.18]  That's a good point.
[4480.98 --> 4482.16]  Like, stormtroopers, yes.
[4482.26 --> 4482.96]  Foot soldiers, no.
[4483.06 --> 4483.32]  Why?
[4487.46 --> 4488.98]  Stormtroopers is huge, too.
[4489.64 --> 4489.80]  Yeah.
[4489.80 --> 4492.42]  Stormtroopers probably gets done more than anything else from that.
[4492.42 --> 4493.92]  And, I mean, these are really iconic.
[4494.10 --> 4495.38]  Like, they'd be very recognizable.
[4496.34 --> 4497.16]  Uh, yes and no.
[4497.36 --> 4497.88]  They're ninjas.
[4498.82 --> 4505.78]  Yeah, but, I mean, if you're, like, a purple ninja with, like, that outfit, I think people
[4505.78 --> 4507.10]  are going to know what you're going for there.
[4507.68 --> 4508.18]  I don't know.
[4508.26 --> 4509.68]  Are ninja turtles just not cool anymore?
[4510.66 --> 4511.02]  They're...
[4511.02 --> 4511.20]  Oh.
[4511.28 --> 4511.78]  Oh, I fell.
[4512.46 --> 4514.04]  Oh, do you lose a whole life for that?
[4514.28 --> 4515.26]  I have no idea.
[4515.40 --> 4516.46]  I thought that was me that fell.
[4516.46 --> 4522.72]  Because I did a dive kick to, like, pretty much the same location.
[4522.90 --> 4524.64]  What I want to know is why they don't fall in it.
[4524.84 --> 4525.40]  Dive kick!
[4525.68 --> 4526.14]  Oh, yeah.
[4526.34 --> 4530.02]  There's a game, I think it was announced at E3, called Dive Kick.
[4530.50 --> 4531.02]  Dive kick.
[4531.12 --> 4532.22]  And it's a fighter game.
[4532.36 --> 4534.28]  Like, we were playing, like, Mortal Kombat style.
[4535.18 --> 4536.64]  But it's one-shot death.
[4537.62 --> 4538.02]  Oh.
[4538.50 --> 4541.28]  So it's kind of like Bushido Blade, where it's, like, realistic.
[4541.60 --> 4542.82]  Press start to continue, quick.
[4543.72 --> 4544.62]  Oh, okay.
[4544.62 --> 4548.28]  So it's kind of like Bushido Blade, then, where it's, like, the thing with that one
[4548.28 --> 4555.76]  is, like, you can only take a realistic number of, like, slices with a sword.
[4556.34 --> 4557.08]  Wow, so none.
[4558.14 --> 4561.88]  Yeah, or, like, and then when you get hit, you're, like, hurt really bad.
[4561.96 --> 4562.22]  Oh, okay.
[4562.22 --> 4563.06]  And you can barely move and stuff.
[4563.72 --> 4564.08]  Interesting.
[4564.58 --> 4565.78]  Yeah, no, I like that game.
[4565.82 --> 4566.18]  It's fun.
[4566.66 --> 4567.68]  We should play that sometime.
[4568.24 --> 4568.66]  Is that...
[4568.66 --> 4569.74]  I think it's PS1.
[4570.80 --> 4571.40]  PS2, maybe?
[4571.68 --> 4572.12]  I don't.
[4572.32 --> 4573.38]  I have a PlayStation 2.
[4573.70 --> 4574.38]  Okay, cool.
[4574.62 --> 4577.94]  I have a PlayStation 2 as well, but no games except for the Mega Man pack.
[4578.92 --> 4579.28]  Hmm.
[4581.42 --> 4581.86]  Hmm.
[4582.40 --> 4583.14]  I'm sure I could...
[4583.14 --> 4587.92]  Well, if we blew the dust out of them, maybe we could find some games that work.
[4588.06 --> 4588.38]  Definitely.
[4588.92 --> 4590.28]  We'd just have to blow the dust out of them.
[4590.34 --> 4590.50]  Yep.
[4592.14 --> 4593.06]  Along with consoles.
[4594.26 --> 4594.56]  What?
[4594.60 --> 4595.46]  No, I have all the consoles.
[4595.60 --> 4596.08]  That would matter.
[4596.68 --> 4598.32]  What consoles would we need?
[4598.32 --> 4602.12]  I'm just saying, if we needed more consoles, we could just blow the dust out of them and
[4602.12 --> 4602.58]  let it be fun.
[4602.94 --> 4605.00]  Well, that just heals all old games, right?
[4605.00 --> 4605.18]  Yeah.
[4605.40 --> 4605.52]  Yeah.
[4606.72 --> 4607.94]  That you own already.
[4608.20 --> 4608.44]  Yeah.
[4608.44 --> 4613.20]  I think we're on slow mode now.
[4614.24 --> 4615.32]  For the Twitch chat?
[4615.50 --> 4615.70]  Yeah.
[4615.82 --> 4619.46]  I also am not a huge fan of slow mode, but with those spamming, it works.
[4619.84 --> 4620.66]  Because it's like...
[4620.66 --> 4620.90]  God.
[4620.90 --> 4625.98]  If you ask a question, and then someone answers it, and then you have to reply with either
[4625.98 --> 4628.30]  a further question or a thank you or something, you just can't.
[4629.24 --> 4630.30]  Oh, don't get that pizza.
[4630.52 --> 4631.20]  That's bad pizza.
[4631.54 --> 4632.22]  It's bomb pizza.
[4632.84 --> 4633.08]  Yeah.
[4634.30 --> 4637.20]  That's not the kind of pizza that we want to come with our online purchases.
[4638.92 --> 4640.30]  We haven't used that joke in a while.
[4640.46 --> 4640.66]  No.
[4640.84 --> 4641.54]  That was awesome.
[4641.54 --> 4642.12]  That was awesome.
[4642.12 --> 4644.48]  I think that might have been the finest moment on the live stream.
[4645.04 --> 4645.40]  Possibly.
[4645.50 --> 4647.48]  That or the AR drone fight thing.
[4648.66 --> 4650.10]  I think that one went on a little long.
[4650.66 --> 4650.78]  Yeah.
[4650.90 --> 4655.44]  Absolutely.
[4680.66 --> 4680.68]  Yeah.
[4680.68 --> 4683.68]  dos
[4710.68 --> 4732.04]  Oh, That's fool
[4740.68 --> 4770.66]  Thank you.
[4770.68 --> 4800.66]  Thank you.
[4800.68 --> 4801.68]  Thank you.
[4801.68 --> 4802.68]  Thank you.
[4802.68 --> 4803.68]  Amazing.
[4803.68 --> 4804.68]  Oh, they like, whoa even when you jump kick.
[4804.68 --> 4812.10]  Oh yeah, no they're just like, they probably have magnets, which are basically magic.
[4812.10 --> 4814.82]  They're not science at all, they're just magic.
[4814.82 --> 4818.48]  Harry Potter, every special effect in those movies, not computers.
[4818.48 --> 4819.48]  Magicks.
[4819.48 --> 4820.48]  I mean, maybe it's.
[4820.48 --> 4821.48]  They're the same thing.
[4821.48 --> 4822.48]  Well, yeah, it's a synonym, so.
[4822.48 --> 4823.48]  Yeah, yeah.
[4823.48 --> 4824.48]  What was that?
[4824.48 --> 4825.48]  I have no idea.
[4825.48 --> 4826.48]  It was a mystery.
[4826.48 --> 4827.48]  Whoa!
[4827.48 --> 4828.48]  And you just got owned.
[4828.48 --> 4829.48]  And you just got owned.
[4829.48 --> 4830.48]  And you didn't get owned.
[4830.48 --> 4831.48]  I was still under effect from the first one.
[4831.48 --> 4833.48]  Whoa, mines, mines, mines, mines.
[4833.48 --> 4834.48]  Okay.
[4834.48 --> 4835.48]  I got this.
[4835.48 --> 4836.48]  I got this.
[4836.48 --> 4837.48]  Oh, okay.
[4837.48 --> 4838.48]  Apparently that's a thing.
[4838.48 --> 4840.48]  Oh, you can just jump over there.
[4840.48 --> 4842.48]  Oh, and onto another one.
[4842.48 --> 4844.48]  Wow, I just lost like half my health.
[4844.48 --> 4846.48]  If you get the foot thing, whoa.
[4846.48 --> 4847.48]  Okay.
[4847.48 --> 4848.48]  Whoa.
[4848.48 --> 4850.48]  Yeah, those aren't a rip off of alien.
[4850.48 --> 4854.48]  Can we go in the bottom here for this one?
[4854.48 --> 4856.48]  Yes, so there's middle.
[4856.48 --> 4857.48]  So we can just hide here.
[4857.48 --> 4859.48]  Well, there's top middle and there's probably a bottom one.
[4859.48 --> 4861.48]  This isn't really how you're supposed to.
[4861.48 --> 4862.48]  Yup.
[4862.48 --> 4864.48]  Are you supposed to fight them?
[4864.48 --> 4865.48]  Oh yeah, you can.
[4865.48 --> 4866.48]  Oh.
[4866.48 --> 4867.48]  Okay.
[4867.48 --> 4868.48]  Dodging them seems easier to me.
[4868.48 --> 4869.48]  Yeah, I think so.
[4869.48 --> 4870.48]  Oh.
[4870.48 --> 4871.48]  Those are weird.
[4871.48 --> 4872.48]  Oh, wait.
[4872.48 --> 4873.48]  What is the...
[4873.48 --> 4874.48]  What is this?
[4874.48 --> 4875.48]  Oh.
[4875.48 --> 4877.48]  I remember that zone.
[4877.48 --> 4879.48]  I don't remember this at all.
[4879.48 --> 4881.48]  Like, is there a real level now?
[4881.48 --> 4883.48]  Is there a boss?
[4883.48 --> 4885.48]  Oh, hey, I have more kills than you.
[4885.48 --> 4886.48]  That's cool.
[4886.48 --> 4889.48]  We should keep track now, now that I'm winning.
[4889.48 --> 4891.48]  First the sewers.
[4891.48 --> 4893.48]  Then the world.
[4893.48 --> 4894.48]  In the world.
[4894.48 --> 4897.48]  Yeah, that's probably how I would approach that problem.
[4897.48 --> 4899.48]  Pretty sure you're supposed to hit the break point.
[4899.48 --> 4901.48]  I'm pretty sure that those are mines.
[4901.48 --> 4904.48]  And the thing about mines is they're not yours.
[4907.48 --> 4908.48]  Hit the break point.
[4908.48 --> 4909.48]  There's no break point.
[4909.48 --> 4910.48]  It's right here.
[4910.48 --> 4911.48]  Oh.
[4911.48 --> 4912.48]  It's in the same spot regardless, I think.
[4912.48 --> 4913.48]  Oh.
[4913.48 --> 4914.48]  Let's see if we can jump kick it.
[4914.48 --> 4917.48]  Well, it's an old game.
[4917.48 --> 4924.48]  It's not like they had, like, fancy pants, you know, computer malized graphics that...
[4924.48 --> 4925.48]  Oh, I'm gonna die.
[4925.48 --> 4926.48]  I'm gonna die.
[4926.48 --> 4927.48]  I'm gonna die.
[4927.48 --> 4929.48]  Is there technically computer malized graphics?
[4929.48 --> 4931.48]  Well, not good computers.
[4931.48 --> 4932.48]  Oh, I died.
[4932.48 --> 4934.48]  Okay, avenge me.
[4934.48 --> 4935.48]  I'm back.
[4935.48 --> 4938.48]  Avenge me.
[4938.48 --> 4940.48]  I'm completely alive.
[4940.48 --> 4943.48]  I love how he's just not hitting me and he's only hitting you.
[4943.48 --> 4944.48]  Yeah, that was kinda weird actually.
[4944.48 --> 4945.48]  That was awesome.
[4945.48 --> 4948.48]  I just got wrecked but he died so it's cool.
[4950.48 --> 4951.48]  I'm getting confused.
[4951.48 --> 4953.48]  People are telling me different stuff like H80.
[4953.48 --> 4959.48]  Is anyone old enough to recognize the reference Fancy the Bard from EverQuest?
[4959.48 --> 4962.48]  Does anyone, does anyone else, does anyone in the chat get that reference?
[4962.48 --> 4963.48]  Fancy from EverQuest.
[4963.48 --> 4964.48]  He was a bard.
[4964.48 --> 4965.48]  Let's kick shell.
[4965.48 --> 4967.48]  I hope someone gets it.
[4967.48 --> 4968.48]  Someone said yes.
[4968.48 --> 4969.48]  He's famous.
[4969.48 --> 4970.48]  Yes!
[4970.48 --> 4971.48]  Fancy the famous bard!
[4971.48 --> 4972.48]  Someone gets it!
[4972.48 --> 4973.48]  That's amazing.
[4973.48 --> 4974.48]  You win an internet from me, sir.
[4974.48 --> 4975.48]  You wanna hear something really crazy right now?
[4975.48 --> 4976.48]  What?
[4976.48 --> 4977.48]  My, uh, my thumb is callusing.
[4977.48 --> 4978.48]  What?
[4978.48 --> 4979.48]  From this?
[4979.48 --> 4981.48]  It has been that long since I have, like, done anything with a controller.
[4981.48 --> 4982.48]  My hands don't callus from controllers.
[4982.48 --> 4984.48]  I have never had a callus from a controller, so...
[4984.48 --> 4985.48]  I don't know.
[4985.48 --> 4986.48]  I don't know.
[4986.48 --> 4987.48]  I don't know.
[4987.48 --> 4988.48]  I don't know.
[4988.48 --> 4989.48]  I don't know.
[4989.48 --> 4990.48]  I don't know.
[4990.48 --> 4991.48]  I don't know.
[4991.48 --> 4992.48]  I don't know.
[4992.48 --> 4993.48]  I don't know.
[4993.48 --> 4994.48]  I don't know.
[4994.48 --> 4995.48]  I don't know.
[4995.48 --> 4996.48]  I don't know.
[4996.48 --> 4997.48]  I don't know.
[4997.48 --> 4998.48]  Controller, so...
[4998.48 --> 4999.48]  Well, I mean, come on.
[4999.48 --> 5002.48]  The old controllers were pretty not ergonomic.
[5002.48 --> 5003.48]  Yeah, I...
[5003.48 --> 5005.48]  Yeah, I played with them.
[5005.48 --> 5007.48]  Not as much as you, but I did.
[5007.48 --> 5009.48]  I mean, I used to have thumb calluses.
[5009.48 --> 5011.48]  I've never had thumb calluses.
[5011.48 --> 5014.48]  Even when I played Halo 1 for, like, eight hours a day.
[5014.48 --> 5018.48]  Which, yes, that controller had way softer buttons than this, but still.
[5018.48 --> 5019.48]  Yeah, I mean, these are just plastic.
[5019.48 --> 5020.48]  Oh, and it's off.
[5020.48 --> 5021.48]  Go, go, jump.
[5021.48 --> 5022.48]  Just jump around.
[5022.48 --> 5023.48]  Jump, jump.
[5023.48 --> 5024.48]  Everybody jump.
[5024.48 --> 5025.48]  Jump.
[5025.48 --> 5026.48]  Jump.
[5026.48 --> 5027.48]  Speaking of the 90s.
[5027.48 --> 5028.48]  I love that saw.
[5028.48 --> 5029.48]  Me too.
[5029.48 --> 5030.48]  Ah, don't let those guys get you.
[5030.48 --> 5033.48]  They, like, bite you and then they're bad.
[5033.48 --> 5035.48]  Someone's telling me to up my game.
[5035.48 --> 5037.48]  I'm Leonardo, just so you know.
[5037.48 --> 5040.48]  Leonardo, the one with 137 kills to Donatello's 96.
[5040.48 --> 5041.48]  Also more lives.
[5041.48 --> 5042.48]  Boom.
[5042.48 --> 5043.48]  Wow, I ran for a second there.
[5043.48 --> 5044.48]  I don't know how to do that.
[5044.48 --> 5045.48]  Oh, oh, no, no.
[5045.48 --> 5046.48]  Oh, it bit me.
[5046.48 --> 5047.48]  Bit me.
[5047.48 --> 5048.48]  Got it, got it.
[5048.48 --> 5049.48]  Got it.
[5049.48 --> 5050.48]  I got it.
[5050.48 --> 5052.48]  Oh, I got bit like three times.
[5052.48 --> 5053.48]  Meanwhile, you're over there like, fighting ninjas with like, a side.
[5053.48 --> 5054.48]  I killed four of the dogs.
[5054.48 --> 5056.48]  I killed my entire, there was equal amount of dogs on.
[5056.48 --> 5057.48]  I killed the dog.
[5057.48 --> 5059.48]  The dog, I killed the dog, I killed the dog.
[5059.48 --> 5060.48]  And the dog, I killed the dog.
[5060.48 --> 5061.48]  It was the dog, I killed the dog.
[5061.48 --> 5062.48]  It was the dog, but it was the dog.
[5062.48 --> 5063.48]  The dog, I killed the dog.
[5063.48 --> 5064.48]  But no, it's the dog.
[5064.48 --> 5065.48]  It was the dog.
[5065.48 --> 5066.48]  That's the dog.
[5066.48 --> 5067.74]  I killed four of the dogs.
[5069.46 --> 5070.52]  I killed my entire...
[5070.52 --> 5072.04]  There was equal amount of dogs on each side.
[5072.10 --> 5073.32]  I killed my whole side of dogs.
[5073.44 --> 5074.74]  I still have 20 more kills than you.
[5075.90 --> 5076.98]  Go get the pizza.
[5078.90 --> 5081.18]  Oh, I thought I was...
[5081.18 --> 5083.84]  Wow.
[5085.22 --> 5085.62]  Wow.
[5086.32 --> 5087.48]  That was awesome.
[5087.60 --> 5088.32]  I'm sorry.
[5088.76 --> 5090.38]  I thought I was the other guy.
[5090.68 --> 5091.16]  Cool.
[5093.16 --> 5096.46]  Oh, your kills restart when you die.
[5097.48 --> 5097.80]  Oh.
[5101.32 --> 5102.24]  Oh, go get the pizza.
[5103.34 --> 5104.48]  Okay, now I'm trolling you.
[5106.42 --> 5107.12]  These guys.
[5107.28 --> 5107.76]  What's up with that?
[5107.78 --> 5108.48]  Hit him in the back.
[5108.58 --> 5109.06]  Hit him in the back.
[5110.24 --> 5111.44]  If you just use the kick.
[5111.80 --> 5112.62]  I bet the kick will work.
[5112.84 --> 5113.00]  Wow.
[5113.14 --> 5115.80]  He can block a kick with his hand up like that.
[5115.88 --> 5116.78]  It's a thing, isn't it?
[5116.82 --> 5117.62]  He's holding something.
[5118.26 --> 5119.10]  So what?
[5119.44 --> 5121.58]  So it's a super magical power ninja block.
[5121.58 --> 5124.44]  The kick of like a 240 pound turtle.
[5124.44 --> 5126.60]  Super magical power ninja block.
[5126.60 --> 5127.34]  Like coming flat.
[5127.40 --> 5128.98]  I haven't killed anything in so long.
[5129.04 --> 5131.20]  You can't argue with the super magical power ninja block.
[5131.40 --> 5132.40]  I can argue with it.
[5132.56 --> 5132.72]  Nope.
[5132.72 --> 5133.34]  I just won't win.
[5133.42 --> 5133.98]  It's infallible.
[5135.64 --> 5137.30]  It's not as infallible as your face.
[5137.58 --> 5138.00]  That's true.
[5138.00 --> 5139.38]  Wow.
[5139.78 --> 5142.64]  I actually haven't killed anything in a really long time.
[5142.74 --> 5143.76]  I'm at 141.
[5144.32 --> 5146.64]  Remember when I was trolling you about being 20 behind?
[5147.84 --> 5150.36]  I guess we'll never know if that math would have worked.
[5156.00 --> 5156.92]  Stop moving.
[5157.12 --> 5157.52]  There we go.
[5158.34 --> 5158.96]  Get out of here.
[5158.96 --> 5161.80]  See, I soften them up for you.
[5161.88 --> 5162.64]  That's sort of my role.
[5162.72 --> 5163.30]  That's it?
[5163.56 --> 5163.74]  Yeah.
[5164.34 --> 5166.22]  That's the one we usually fight on different parts of the screen.
[5166.68 --> 5168.82]  Yeah, I soften them up so that when they...
[5168.82 --> 5170.18]  That doesn't look like something we can go through.
[5170.18 --> 5170.38]  No, no.
[5170.42 --> 5171.18]  These are bad.
[5171.26 --> 5175.32]  These are like a bunch of those stupid guys with the whip things come out of here.
[5176.04 --> 5176.94]  Fight what, April?
[5177.38 --> 5178.96]  I can't go through the...
[5178.96 --> 5179.84]  I don't want to...
[5179.84 --> 5180.06]  Oh.
[5180.24 --> 5180.56]  Oh.
[5180.56 --> 5180.72]  Oh.
[5180.96 --> 5181.36]  Oh.
[5181.36 --> 5182.40]  Oh, this is boss.
[5182.52 --> 5182.84]  Never mind.
[5183.46 --> 5184.86]  Master say have fun.
[5185.86 --> 5186.30]  Fun.
[5186.30 --> 5186.86]  Fun.
[5186.86 --> 5187.22]  Fun.
[5187.38 --> 5187.62]  Fun.
[5190.02 --> 5190.42]  Okay.
[5190.80 --> 5193.14]  And so that one has a freezing ray, evidently.
[5194.68 --> 5195.08]  No.
[5198.76 --> 5200.54]  Oh, and if you touch the thing, that's bad.
[5200.58 --> 5201.70]  Can we make them do that?
[5202.04 --> 5202.64]  I don't...
[5202.64 --> 5203.46]  I kind of doubt it.
[5204.02 --> 5206.40]  That would require some serious NVIDIA physics.
[5206.78 --> 5207.08]  Oh, no.
[5207.12 --> 5208.02]  We're both going to die soon.
[5208.52 --> 5208.82]  No.
[5208.92 --> 5209.40]  I'm down.
[5209.52 --> 5210.00]  You're down.
[5210.54 --> 5212.34]  Does that make us, like, super loose?
[5212.44 --> 5212.64]  No.
[5212.84 --> 5213.36]  No, I haven't...
[5213.36 --> 5213.82]  Oh, wow.
[5213.86 --> 5214.82]  You can change your character.
[5215.24 --> 5215.92]  I didn't even know that.
[5215.92 --> 5216.88]  Yeah, in between.
[5217.14 --> 5217.82]  That's pretty cool.
[5218.08 --> 5218.34]  Yeah.
[5220.32 --> 5221.42]  Let's kill Rahazar.
[5223.52 --> 5224.06]  Uh-oh.
[5229.78 --> 5231.04]  Oh, are they zapped now?
[5231.12 --> 5231.40]  Oh, look.
[5231.44 --> 5231.80]  It's a dog.
[5232.40 --> 5233.08]  Because he...
[5233.08 --> 5233.70]  When he died.
[5235.56 --> 5236.26]  Wow, really?
[5238.10 --> 5239.78]  This guy will turn into a little thing, too.
[5240.26 --> 5240.50]  Yeah.
[5240.96 --> 5241.32]  Hey, look.
[5241.36 --> 5241.88]  It's a squid.
[5242.34 --> 5242.66]  Turtle?
[5243.00 --> 5243.30]  No.
[5243.30 --> 5243.90]  Okay.
[5243.90 --> 5243.92]  Okay.
[5251.44 --> 5253.14]  Those fire effects are tops.
[5254.34 --> 5254.66]  Whoa!
[5254.90 --> 5255.54]  Where is he, guys?
[5255.74 --> 5256.26]  Oh, yeah.
[5256.34 --> 5256.56]  Sorry.
[5256.66 --> 5257.28]  I was, uh...
[5257.28 --> 5258.46]  Okay, so who should take the pizza?
[5258.64 --> 5258.94]  Oh, me.
[5259.14 --> 5259.32]  Okay.
[5259.78 --> 5260.38]  I got it.
[5260.76 --> 5261.16]  Don't worry.
[5261.20 --> 5261.68]  I got this.
[5262.08 --> 5262.30]  Okay.
[5262.30 --> 5263.58]  I'm good at getting the pizza.
[5263.82 --> 5264.32]  I noticed.
[5265.88 --> 5270.08]  Okay, now I'm gonna have to actually up my game a little bit here because we died at the same
[5270.08 --> 5271.46]  time, so...
[5271.46 --> 5274.58]  The count may actually be accurate right now.
[5274.58 --> 5278.30]  Here, I'll just, uh...
[5278.30 --> 5278.84]  I'll help you.
[5279.76 --> 5280.12]  What?
[5280.44 --> 5281.38]  Look at that dude.
[5281.78 --> 5283.10]  He's just like...
[5283.10 --> 5284.64]  I'm gonna watch all my buddies die.
[5284.88 --> 5285.70]  No big deal.
[5287.02 --> 5288.06]  I love henchmen.
[5288.14 --> 5288.68]  They're hilarious.
[5288.90 --> 5289.30]  I'm helping.
[5290.38 --> 5290.94]  Are you?
[5291.08 --> 5291.28]  Yeah.
[5291.38 --> 5293.28]  I think I got, like, quite a few kills there.
[5293.34 --> 5294.34]  No, I'm pretty sure I was helping.
[5294.40 --> 5295.06]  I think you got two?
[5295.10 --> 5296.40]  I'm pretty sure that I softened them.
[5296.64 --> 5297.22]  Soften them up.
[5298.04 --> 5299.18]  Oh, I hate these things.
[5299.18 --> 5299.62]  I hate these things.
[5300.62 --> 5301.80]  I hate these things.
[5302.34 --> 5304.60]  See, I take care of all the tough guys while you're busy dying.
[5304.62 --> 5305.76]  You let me take the hit.
[5311.50 --> 5313.72]  Someone's like, those are some sweet 64-bit colors.
[5314.18 --> 5317.84]  I think 64-bit is a bit of an overestimation there.
[5319.66 --> 5322.80]  Them be not 64-bit much of anything.
[5326.96 --> 5328.72]  Maybe if you weren't kill-stealing all the time.
[5328.72 --> 5333.14]  You know, my understanding is that in gamer culture, that's actually looked down upon.
[5334.30 --> 5338.64]  I mean, I'm not an expert or anything, but it's just, like...
[5338.64 --> 5339.40]  I'd say.
[5340.76 --> 5341.76]  I got nine kills.
[5344.62 --> 5345.02]  Whoa.
[5345.88 --> 5346.86]  I hate these guys.
[5346.94 --> 5347.06]  Okay.
[5347.14 --> 5348.06]  Phase through the ground.
[5352.10 --> 5353.42]  That seemed to work out.
[5353.74 --> 5355.04]  I don't even know what happened there.
[5355.04 --> 5355.92]  Yeah, me neither.
[5358.72 --> 5361.26]  Someone says the SNES was only capable of producing 80 colors.
[5361.26 --> 5362.06]  Isn't this, like, it?
[5362.70 --> 5363.68]  No, I don't think so.
[5363.86 --> 5364.56]  Oh, really?
[5364.90 --> 5365.22]  Maybe.
[5365.62 --> 5366.92]  I kind of think this is it.
[5367.94 --> 5369.40]  So what are we supposed to do?
[5369.86 --> 5370.82]  Kill the dudes, probably.
[5371.04 --> 5372.46]  And then he'll probably shoot something at...
[5372.46 --> 5373.90]  Oh, are we supposed to hit the hand?
[5374.62 --> 5375.40]  Maybe not hit the hand.
[5375.40 --> 5376.02]  There's a hand?
[5376.02 --> 5376.66]  He just...
[5376.66 --> 5377.70]  Look, he just shot out his...
[5377.70 --> 5378.66]  Okay, it's not really a hand.
[5378.72 --> 5379.32]  It's a claw thing.
[5379.82 --> 5380.62]  Yeah, okay.
[5380.70 --> 5382.58]  I don't know what kind of hands you have, but...
[5382.58 --> 5388.12]  I'm going to go ahead and make some assumptions that they're not the kind that, like, a girl wants
[5388.12 --> 5388.84]  to be involved in.
[5390.80 --> 5393.44]  Because if they're claws, then that would be a little...
[5393.44 --> 5393.84]  Awful.
[5394.24 --> 5394.58]  Wow.
[5396.08 --> 5396.52]  Wow.
[5396.52 --> 5397.96]  Shield.
[5398.44 --> 5399.24]  How do we bring down...
[5399.24 --> 5399.70]  Oh, shred.
[5401.14 --> 5401.50]  Um...
[5401.50 --> 5402.22]  How do we hit him?
[5402.30 --> 5402.56]  Oh!
[5403.52 --> 5404.78]  I almost didn't come back.
[5405.04 --> 5406.78]  So he has, what, like, machine guns?
[5407.74 --> 5410.20]  And, like, scary claw things.
[5410.46 --> 5410.94]  Am I hitting it?
[5410.98 --> 5411.90]  I don't think I'm hitting him.
[5412.04 --> 5413.38]  I have no idea how to do this.
[5413.54 --> 5414.38]  I don't know how to hit him.
[5414.50 --> 5415.48]  What does Twitch chat say?
[5415.88 --> 5416.50]  Twitch chat!
[5416.96 --> 5417.88]  Tell us what to do!
[5417.90 --> 5419.20]  I'm getting wrecked while I'm trying to read.
[5419.26 --> 5420.52]  You guys have to throw...
[5420.52 --> 5421.76]  Oh, we have to throw guys at him!
[5422.04 --> 5423.52]  Oh, I don't know how to do that throw.
[5423.60 --> 5424.44]  Me neither, actually.
[5424.94 --> 5426.32]  But sometimes it just works.
[5426.32 --> 5427.66]  So I'm just gonna hit people.
[5428.04 --> 5428.60]  I died again.
[5428.68 --> 5429.52]  Oh, that guy grabbed me.
[5431.48 --> 5432.86]  Fortunately, it wasn't with the claw hand.
[5433.00 --> 5433.36]  There we go.
[5433.62 --> 5433.90]  Yeah!
[5435.08 --> 5437.08]  That didn't even do a full bar damage.
[5437.46 --> 5438.14]  So...
[5438.14 --> 5439.88]  This is gonna be real fun.
[5440.70 --> 5441.52]  Oh, those are guns.
[5442.58 --> 5443.92]  Yeah, he has a machine gun.
[5444.16 --> 5445.20]  I thought we covered this.
[5445.64 --> 5447.04]  I know, but he hadn't shot it yet, really.
[5447.54 --> 5448.36]  Yeah, he was.
[5448.50 --> 5449.62]  He's been shooting the whole time.
[5449.92 --> 5450.28]  Nice!
[5451.14 --> 5451.56]  Okay, not a bar yet.
[5451.56 --> 5453.12]  That still wasn't a full bar.
[5453.12 --> 5453.52]  Okay.
[5456.32 --> 5460.48]  Wow, you don't have a lot of time to maneuver here.
[5460.94 --> 5462.14]  Okay, is there actually...
[5462.14 --> 5464.48]  Twitch chat, is there actually a combo to make it throw?
[5464.80 --> 5465.62]  Yes, there is.
[5465.70 --> 5466.70]  I used to know how to do it.
[5466.96 --> 5467.62]  I got another one.
[5467.84 --> 5469.60]  I'm not sure what the combo is.
[5470.14 --> 5470.66]  There we go.
[5470.78 --> 5470.82]  Nice.
[5470.82 --> 5472.08]  I think it's like down and throw.
[5473.42 --> 5474.62]  Down and why?
[5475.16 --> 5477.22]  Yeah, down and why, but you gotta be in close.
[5478.50 --> 5479.22]  Yeah, there we go.
[5479.22 --> 5481.88]  Oh, I flopped it.
[5482.14 --> 5483.16]  So you gotta be in close too?
[5483.34 --> 5483.94]  Proximity is pretty?
[5483.94 --> 5484.38]  Yeah, you gotta be...
[5484.38 --> 5484.98]  Hey, we got a bar.
[5487.42 --> 5487.74]  Okay.
[5487.86 --> 5488.06]  Yeah!
[5489.52 --> 5490.10]  Oh, shoot.
[5490.20 --> 5491.04]  I killed the guy by accident.
[5492.78 --> 5494.14]  Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[5494.32 --> 5494.98]  Oh, oh.
[5495.24 --> 5495.92]  We got another bar.
[5496.06 --> 5496.62]  We got another bar.
[5496.70 --> 5497.32]  Okay, we got this.
[5498.88 --> 5499.20]  Bro!
[5499.76 --> 5500.08]  Yes!
[5500.70 --> 5500.92]  Yeah!
[5501.68 --> 5502.00]  Alright.
[5502.88 --> 5504.20]  Okay, let's see who can get the kill.
[5506.40 --> 5507.34]  Because it's a competition.
[5507.66 --> 5508.26]  It's always a competition.
[5508.38 --> 5508.64]  Boom.
[5509.02 --> 5510.04]  Oh, he's down to zero bars.
[5510.22 --> 5510.60]  I got him.
[5510.80 --> 5511.54]  Oh, okay.
[5511.60 --> 5511.92]  Good job.
[5512.04 --> 5512.32]  Good job.
[5512.98 --> 5516.22]  We should pant shredder.
[5516.26 --> 5517.88]  And I completely died during that fight.
[5518.32 --> 5518.88]  I gotta continue.
[5520.78 --> 5522.66]  My patience is wearing thin.
[5522.74 --> 5523.96]  I'm banishing you to a time warp?
[5524.26 --> 5525.82]  That was the prologue.
[5528.02 --> 5528.42]  Oh.
[5529.08 --> 5530.62]  Maybe I haven't beat this game.
[5530.92 --> 5532.96]  I kind of thought that was the end.
[5533.78 --> 5537.04]  Someone asked, where is our K-95 unboxing?
[5537.50 --> 5538.48]  Definitely coming.
[5539.86 --> 5543.18]  Wait, there's like, isn't it the future, but there's like dinosaurs and stuff?
[5544.56 --> 5544.96]  BC.
[5545.36 --> 5547.08]  It could be the past, but there are dinosaurs.
[5547.24 --> 5547.60]  What is that?
[5547.66 --> 5548.02]  25?
[5548.64 --> 5549.58]  What is this?
[5550.22 --> 5550.98]  Hold on.
[5551.22 --> 5553.50]  1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[5553.82 --> 5557.48]  So that's 2 trillion 500 billion years ago?
[5557.48 --> 5559.12]  I thought he said future.
[5560.92 --> 5564.02]  Someone says everyone thinks this is the end.
[5565.02 --> 5565.46]  Oh, do they?
[5565.46 --> 5566.40]  I'm kind of bored of this game now.
[5567.20 --> 5567.64]  Whoa.
[5567.64 --> 5567.80]  Whoa.
[5569.30 --> 5570.80]  I want the ninjas back.
[5571.12 --> 5571.82]  I kind of hate that.
[5571.82 --> 5573.82]  Why do the rocks explode?
[5573.82 --> 5577.20]  Let's keep moving forward now.
[5577.20 --> 5578.48]  How do you run?
[5579.08 --> 5579.72]  I don't know.
[5580.20 --> 5580.78]  Okay, well the ninjas are back.
[5580.78 --> 5581.62]  Yeah, the ninjas are back.
[5582.38 --> 5584.96]  Okay, and now that we know how to throw them at the screen, that's kind of neat.
[5585.18 --> 5585.44]  Yep.
[5585.44 --> 5590.16]  It's kind of cool.
[5590.90 --> 5592.82]  It's kind of cool not being able to see anything.
[5594.36 --> 5600.36]  We've got to dust off some of our other consoles so we can play some more advanced games than
[5600.36 --> 5600.64]  this.
[5601.64 --> 5603.02]  Because I mean, this is cool and all that.
[5603.02 --> 5606.96]  We'll end up playing...
[5606.96 --> 5607.46]  Oh, man.
[5608.20 --> 5610.86]  Trying to save you and then something hit me behind that stupid pillar.
[5611.10 --> 5612.54]  We should just play some Zelda.
[5612.98 --> 5615.04]  And then the other person can just eat.
[5615.26 --> 5615.96]  You can play the games.
[5616.04 --> 5616.30]  I'll eat.
[5617.54 --> 5618.20]  I'm hungry.
[5620.72 --> 5622.54]  And my wife's not making me dinner tonight.
[5622.86 --> 5624.16]  I'm supposed to be the one making dinner.
[5624.16 --> 5628.20]  I love how we just don't change the time out on the screen.
[5628.76 --> 5632.20]  And we just let it happen every time.
[5632.58 --> 5634.38]  I think if you just hold it for a...
[5634.38 --> 5635.30]  Oh, that's cool.
[5635.62 --> 5636.20]  Which one was that?
[5636.22 --> 5639.90]  If you charge at someone and then attack them, because you're so close, he just grabs them
[5639.90 --> 5640.38]  and throws them.
[5640.90 --> 5644.38]  And to charge, you just hold a direction for a while.
[5644.44 --> 5648.68]  Oh, you can also charge at them and shoulder them.
[5649.58 --> 5650.38]  Yeah, how do you shoulder?
[5650.82 --> 5652.70]  You just hit Y when you're in close.
[5652.94 --> 5653.60]  Yeah, that's what I meant.
[5653.60 --> 5654.56]  That's what I...
[5654.56 --> 5656.04]  Oh, I got knocked over.
[5659.20 --> 5661.16]  I think I have an action figure of this, too.
[5661.94 --> 5663.22]  What is he even supposed to be?
[5663.28 --> 5664.02]  He's a rock dude.
[5664.58 --> 5665.30]  He has a helmet.
[5665.84 --> 5667.48]  Why would a rock dude wear a helmet?
[5667.70 --> 5668.00]  Seriously.
[5668.72 --> 5670.82]  Like, is he afraid that he's going to fall off the stage?
[5670.94 --> 5673.48]  Like, it looks like he has a helmet and boots, so I was wondering...
[5673.48 --> 5677.36]  Wow.
[5677.82 --> 5681.32]  So I was wondering for a second there if he was supposed to be, like, a football player.
[5682.24 --> 5683.26]  A football player.
[5683.26 --> 5684.28]  Hey man, Mario did it.
[5685.44 --> 5685.80]  That's...
[5685.80 --> 5686.96]  You can see that about pretty much everything.
[5686.98 --> 5689.20]  Okay, Charging Chuck is not a football player.
[5689.60 --> 5690.28]  He looks like a...
[5690.28 --> 5691.22]  He does not.
[5691.60 --> 5697.18]  He looks like a bat catcher, a football player, and a baseball player combined.
[5697.64 --> 5700.62]  Because he wears a bat catcher's, like, chest thing.
[5701.18 --> 5701.78]  Football helmet.
[5701.78 --> 5703.64]  Oh, I thought I was playing you, and I took a bunch of damage.
[5704.96 --> 5707.42]  Oh, because that's how you would be about it?
[5707.50 --> 5709.64]  If you were playing me, you'd just take damage on purpose?
[5710.34 --> 5710.68]  No!
[5711.80 --> 5712.80]  I was just in a...
[5712.80 --> 5714.94]  If you charge these guys, they can't block it.
[5715.54 --> 5715.86]  Oh.
[5715.86 --> 5716.26]  Whoa.
[5717.96 --> 5718.28]  Whoa.
[5718.48 --> 5719.08]  What was that?
[5719.32 --> 5720.42]  That's what happens with my wife.
[5721.24 --> 5722.98]  She charges things, and I can't stop her.
[5723.70 --> 5724.08]  Get it?
[5724.14 --> 5724.62]  Credit cards?
[5724.74 --> 5725.64]  Because wives use your money.
[5725.82 --> 5726.82]  I thought you were going somewhere else.
[5726.82 --> 5728.30]  She makes more money than me, but, you know.
[5728.30 --> 5735.80]  Oh, I think down and throw is the, like, toss around.
[5736.14 --> 5736.24]  What's throw?
[5736.58 --> 5736.86]  Why?
[5737.40 --> 5738.60]  It's, like, the attack button.
[5738.74 --> 5739.22]  Okay, yeah.
[5739.46 --> 5741.46]  Because you keep on saying, like, down and...
[5741.46 --> 5742.84]  Left and charge, and down and throw.
[5742.84 --> 5748.26]  Okay, well, down and throw implies that they, um...
[5749.46 --> 5750.72]  That they're also nearby.
[5753.40 --> 5753.80]  Right?
[5755.26 --> 5755.66]  Yeah.
[5755.66 --> 5759.66]  But it's not necessarily throw if it's universal.
[5760.74 --> 5762.14]  But it's not not throw.
[5762.42 --> 5762.88]  That's true.
[5763.38 --> 5764.58]  Look at the way he runs.
[5765.16 --> 5765.52]  Man!
[5766.18 --> 5767.90]  Is that how people ran in the 90s?
[5768.80 --> 5770.98]  Man, people did everything better in the 90s.
[5772.88 --> 5773.32]  Aw.
[5773.48 --> 5773.60]  Oh.
[5773.60 --> 5773.66]  Oh.
[5774.58 --> 5774.88]  Okay.
[5775.52 --> 5775.98]  Oh, wait.
[5776.38 --> 5776.84]  Oh, okay.
[5777.20 --> 5777.58]  Never mind.
[5777.82 --> 5778.70]  I was going to say...
[5778.70 --> 5779.60]  Wow.
[5779.60 --> 5780.24]  Whoa.
[5780.44 --> 5781.92]  We're getting wrecked.
[5782.56 --> 5784.32]  Half of our lives.
[5785.22 --> 5785.62]  Wow.
[5786.44 --> 5788.28]  Uh, you can go where the way.
[5788.28 --> 5789.28]  That's...
[5789.28 --> 5790.10]  Okay, that's pretty even.
[5790.10 --> 5792.10]  Why don't we see who's worse off by the end of this scene?
[5794.30 --> 5795.96]  I like to be fair about things, you know?
[5797.14 --> 5799.52]  Fair like, you know, a beautiful maiden is fair.
[5800.00 --> 5801.24]  That's the kind of fair I am.
[5802.82 --> 5804.72]  But wouldn't you not want to be that fair?
[5805.10 --> 5805.72]  That fair?
[5806.10 --> 5806.30]  Yeah.
[5806.30 --> 5810.30]  Being fair is actually a good thing in many cultures.
[5811.80 --> 5813.06]  Uh, I think we had it equal.
[5813.18 --> 5813.50]  Okay, here.
[5813.58 --> 5815.48]  We'll start at either end of the screen and then we'll race to it.
[5816.76 --> 5817.80]  Well, that's kind of cheating.
[5818.14 --> 5818.74]  Okay, hold on.
[5819.36 --> 5819.64]  Ready?
[5819.82 --> 5820.96]  Wait, you're closer again.
[5821.04 --> 5821.62]  Go further away.
[5821.82 --> 5821.98]  Okay.
[5821.98 --> 5822.08]  Okay.
[5822.76 --> 5822.98]  No.
[5823.24 --> 5824.42]  Turn the other way.
[5824.82 --> 5825.04]  Ready?
[5825.30 --> 5825.54]  Set?
[5825.68 --> 5825.88]  Draw!
[5826.44 --> 5827.08]  Yeah, I got it.
[5827.30 --> 5829.04]  Because I predicted when I was going to say draw.
[5830.12 --> 5830.56]  What?
[5831.70 --> 5833.04]  That's so not fair.
[5833.90 --> 5837.14]  I already knew it wasn't fair, but like, did you go early?
[5837.46 --> 5837.68]  Yeah.
[5838.06 --> 5838.50]  What?
[5839.22 --> 5840.20]  Well, it's like...
[5840.20 --> 5841.54]  Okay, look at it this way.
[5841.66 --> 5846.56]  Like, in an Olympic event, is it a false start if they go at exactly the time the whistle goes
[5846.56 --> 5847.40]  because they predicted it?
[5847.40 --> 5850.06]  No, but they're not the person following the whistle.
[5853.58 --> 5854.82]  Oh my goodness.
[5856.56 --> 5857.36]  Oh man.
[5857.52 --> 5858.64]  What's coming, boss?
[5858.90 --> 5859.18]  Okay.
[5859.42 --> 5860.84]  Oh no, I think I remember this.
[5860.88 --> 5861.50]  This is brutal.
[5862.02 --> 5863.42]  You're a history, slime balls.
[5863.60 --> 5864.30]  Slime balls!
[5864.40 --> 5865.50]  Turtles aren't even slimy.
[5865.70 --> 5867.48]  That's the thing that's confusing to me about this.
[5868.44 --> 5871.08]  That's one of the things that's confusing to me about a whole bunch of turtles.
[5871.08 --> 5872.34]  Oh, I changed characters by accident.
[5872.52 --> 5873.98]  Oh, I should die so I can take Donatello.
[5874.12 --> 5874.70]  I like Donatello.
[5874.86 --> 5875.52]  Hope I die first.
[5875.58 --> 5876.18]  He was my favorite.
[5876.18 --> 5878.18]  Purple was like my favorite color when I was going up.
[5878.48 --> 5878.88]  That's cool.
[5878.98 --> 5879.50]  He's blocking.
[5879.62 --> 5880.14]  We're not hitting him.
[5880.40 --> 5880.62]  Nope.
[5881.30 --> 5882.48]  Oh, so we should go on either side.
[5883.06 --> 5883.28]  Yep.
[5883.30 --> 5885.04]  How would you be supposed to beat this on your own?
[5885.24 --> 5886.12]  Probably really hard.
[5888.74 --> 5889.06]  Really?
[5889.12 --> 5889.68]  From this game?
[5893.74 --> 5895.10]  Why do you have to take everything there?
[5896.12 --> 5896.36]  Me?
[5899.04 --> 5900.22]  Okay, we should pick sides.
[5900.30 --> 5900.80]  You're on the right.
[5901.34 --> 5901.66]  What?
[5901.98 --> 5902.60]  You're on the right.
[5902.66 --> 5903.88]  I'm on the left so that we can hit him.
[5904.16 --> 5904.40]  Oh.
[5904.40 --> 5907.56]  Wait, he can block from every direction at once.
[5907.56 --> 5909.08]  You have to get him at certain times.
[5911.12 --> 5911.80]  Like that.
[5912.22 --> 5913.48]  And then you can hit him for a little while.
[5913.74 --> 5913.90]  Yeah.
[5914.02 --> 5915.16]  For a really little while.
[5915.62 --> 5918.72]  So what other than that, you basically have to just let him have his way with you?
[5918.72 --> 5923.00]  Oh, you took it there.
[5923.80 --> 5924.00]  What?
[5924.06 --> 5924.38]  How?
[5925.38 --> 5925.94]  I don't know.
[5926.00 --> 5926.70]  You find a way.
[5926.88 --> 5927.46]  Every time.
[5929.06 --> 5929.74]  Every time.
[5930.84 --> 5932.00]  When you hit him, he bends over.
[5932.54 --> 5932.72]  See, like...
[5932.72 --> 5933.62]  Wow!
[5933.62 --> 5935.22]  Look at the look on his face.
[5936.98 --> 5937.48]  Hold on.
[5937.52 --> 5937.72]  Hold on.
[5937.78 --> 5938.06]  Wait for it.
[5938.20 --> 5938.40]  Wait for it.
[5938.40 --> 5938.78]  Wait for it.
[5940.34 --> 5942.50]  Oh, wow.
[5942.62 --> 5944.48]  His sword has kind of better reach than ours.
[5946.58 --> 5949.78]  Maybe if you didn't carry around dinky little forks, we wouldn't have this problem.
[5949.78 --> 5951.28]  I think I'm doing better than you.
[5954.56 --> 5955.62]  I'm taking Donatelo.
[5955.80 --> 5956.10]  Oh, no.
[5956.14 --> 5956.84]  That wasn't a continue.
[5959.24 --> 5959.68]  Forks.
[5960.26 --> 5961.38]  How are those even weapons?
[5961.84 --> 5965.66]  I mean, it's better than Michelangelo, who carries around, like, two sausages tied together.
[5968.62 --> 5969.66]  Those can hurt me.
[5970.34 --> 5972.14]  They can hurt, but, like, do they kill?
[5973.00 --> 5973.32]  Potentially.
[5973.48 --> 5974.06]  Blood force trauma.
[5974.68 --> 5974.88]  Who?
[5975.08 --> 5976.02]  Blood force trauma.
[5976.54 --> 5979.48]  That seems less effective than, like, a blowtorch.
[5980.24 --> 5982.10]  I mean, what about the turtle that had the blowtorch?
[5983.52 --> 5984.36]  Or a flamethrower.
[5984.42 --> 5985.46]  That's the word I was looking for.
[5985.62 --> 5987.94]  Because a blowtorch wouldn't really be that great for killing people.
[5988.50 --> 5993.22]  I mean, you could kill someone with a blowtorch in much the same way you could kill them with a fork or a sausage.
[5993.60 --> 5994.72]  Or a piece of paper or a water.
[5995.02 --> 5995.20]  Yeah.
[5995.70 --> 5996.98]  No water works.
[5997.16 --> 5997.86]  Drowning's a thing.
[5998.04 --> 5998.22]  Yeah.
[5998.22 --> 6001.14]  How would you kill someone with a piece of paper?
[6002.22 --> 6003.14]  Paper cut on the throat.
[6005.36 --> 6007.36]  That's asking for a lot of stars to align there.
[6007.38 --> 6007.72]  It is.
[6007.84 --> 6008.44]  Still possible.
[6009.54 --> 6009.88]  Okay.
[6011.56 --> 6013.06]  Can you attack more?
[6013.54 --> 6015.16]  I've attacked plenty.
[6016.32 --> 6018.90]  Maybe if you weren't wasting all of our lives.
[6019.40 --> 6019.84]  Well, whatever.
[6019.94 --> 6020.74]  I have Donatello now.
[6020.84 --> 6022.96]  So now we're going to see what's up.
[6023.02 --> 6024.70]  Because Donatello has all the reach.
[6025.54 --> 6025.90]  See?
[6026.02 --> 6026.86]  I'm going to kill him now.
[6027.14 --> 6027.32]  See?
[6027.34 --> 6027.72]  I got him.
[6027.72 --> 6028.24]  I got him.
[6028.24 --> 6028.78]  You know he's dead, right?
[6028.90 --> 6029.90]  He was already dead.
[6030.30 --> 6031.44]  Like a while ago.
[6032.28 --> 6034.22]  Someone says you can't burn someone with a fork.
[6036.64 --> 6038.04]  When did we say that?
[6040.22 --> 6041.92]  Linus, do you watch Girl Gone Gamer?
[6042.14 --> 6042.48]  No.
[6042.68 --> 6043.60]  What even is that?
[6043.60 --> 6044.60]  I have no idea?
[6044.60 --> 6045.22]  I have no idea.
[6045.22 --> 6045.32]  I have no time.
[6045.32 --> 6045.34]  I have no time.
[6045.34 --> 6046.94]  So I don't really watch anything.
[6048.60 --> 6052.78]  Except like, um, I should come up with something that I can watch.
[6055.24 --> 6055.64]  You.
[6056.36 --> 6056.68]  Oh.
[6056.92 --> 6057.10]  Tube?
[6059.10 --> 6059.80]  No, like them.
[6060.00 --> 6060.34]  I know.
[6060.34 --> 6061.16]  Oh.
[6061.16 --> 6061.18]  Oh.
[6061.18 --> 6061.20]  Oh.
[6063.02 --> 6063.34]  EA.
[6063.34 --> 6063.42]  Yeah.
[6065.68 --> 6067.58]  Every fist bump's going to have that set up now.
[6067.72 --> 6071.48]  Like, it could be a positive fist bump or it could be like, yeah, you're an idiot fist bump.
[6071.86 --> 6073.38]  I don't want to be this guy anymore.
[6073.66 --> 6074.34]  Yeah, he sucks.
[6075.44 --> 6076.70]  He like, hardcore sucks.
[6077.08 --> 6078.94]  That's why you were getting all the kills.
[6080.26 --> 6081.04]  Donatello's awesome.
[6081.18 --> 6082.04]  He has all the reach.
[6082.08 --> 6082.90]  I forgot about this.
[6082.92 --> 6086.82]  He gets to stand like eight feet away and bat people with a stick.
[6087.36 --> 6090.00]  Like, look how much closer you have to be.
[6090.02 --> 6090.82]  You've gotten two kills.
[6090.86 --> 6091.50]  I've gotten six.
[6092.28 --> 6093.10]  I have 26.
[6093.60 --> 6095.68]  Yeah, but I died.
[6095.68 --> 6097.44]  That's actually not the way the math works.
[6097.92 --> 6098.32]  What?
[6098.78 --> 6100.18]  In a period of time.
[6101.26 --> 6101.66]  Yeah.
[6101.92 --> 6105.38]  Like, rates are not calculated by periods of time.
[6106.70 --> 6107.86]  What?
[6110.66 --> 6114.06]  Rates are calculated by, like, how much money it costs over a period.
[6116.46 --> 6117.06]  Okay, hold on.
[6117.10 --> 6119.70]  I'm trying to come up with something that's a rate that doesn't have a period of time.
[6119.88 --> 6120.84]  You're just wrong.
[6120.92 --> 6123.88]  No, rates are, um, rates are a method of...
[6123.88 --> 6124.38]  Oh, my God.
[6124.48 --> 6126.06]  How do you tell which things are going to...
[6126.06 --> 6126.98]  Oh, there's a little bit.
[6128.30 --> 6128.66]  Okay.
[6134.16 --> 6135.50]  Be aggressive.
[6135.86 --> 6136.06]  Be.
[6136.28 --> 6136.48]  Be.
[6136.94 --> 6137.22]  Aggressive.
[6137.44 --> 6139.42]  If I cheerlead, then I don't actually have to do anything.
[6139.64 --> 6140.92]  At least that's what those girls think.
[6143.24 --> 6144.46]  The girls that are cheerleaders.
[6144.56 --> 6145.60]  They're not even helping win.
[6150.06 --> 6151.58]  Bunch of lazy layabouts.
[6153.38 --> 6154.66]  I want to see you do that.
[6155.00 --> 6155.36]  Cheerleading?
[6155.60 --> 6155.80]  Yeah.
[6155.94 --> 6156.64]  I could cheerlead.
[6157.56 --> 6158.94]  Are you going to do, like, the pickups?
[6159.02 --> 6159.56]  I just said it.
[6159.62 --> 6161.12]  I was like, be aggressive.
[6161.36 --> 6162.36]  It's not just chanting.
[6162.62 --> 6163.10]  Yeah, it is.
[6163.24 --> 6163.80]  No, it's not.
[6164.04 --> 6165.50]  I've never seen them do anything.
[6165.50 --> 6166.94]  They do, like, crazy pyramids and stuff.
[6166.94 --> 6168.04]  Have they ever gotten a touchdown?
[6168.92 --> 6171.00]  Can you get a pyramid by getting a touchdown?
[6171.16 --> 6172.86]  Can you get a pyramid by getting a touchdown?
[6172.98 --> 6173.16]  Yeah.
[6173.16 --> 6175.98]  That's judging the wrong team there.
[6176.56 --> 6177.72]  Judging the wrong team?
[6177.84 --> 6180.36]  Yeah, you're saying, can you get a pyramid by getting a touchdown?
[6180.52 --> 6182.36]  Well, can you get a pyramid by being a cheerleader?
[6182.92 --> 6184.20]  Because I bet they all get them.
[6185.02 --> 6185.34]  Wow.
[6187.42 --> 6188.38]  You're horrible.
[6188.94 --> 6189.88]  Come on, that was pretty good.
[6191.22 --> 6191.58]  Man.
[6191.58 --> 6193.30]  Now we're going to see who was carrying the team.
[6193.46 --> 6194.52]  I almost caught up to you.
[6194.52 --> 6197.90]  I am going to be playing for, like, ten more minutes on my...
[6197.90 --> 6204.76]  Get that pizza box.
[6204.96 --> 6205.64]  Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[6205.66 --> 6206.20]  That's a good idea.
[6206.32 --> 6207.46]  I'm going to do that right now.
[6207.50 --> 6208.56]  It blows up everyone on the screen.
[6208.64 --> 6209.16]  That's why it's a bomb.
[6209.24 --> 6210.12]  Yeah, that's why it's a bomb.
[6210.28 --> 6211.04]  That's why you're the bomb.
[6211.04 --> 6215.70]  These are the worst arrows ever.
[6215.82 --> 6216.14]  Look at them.
[6216.18 --> 6217.22]  They only go, like, three feet.
[6219.50 --> 6221.36]  They don't even try and, like, aim.
[6221.50 --> 6222.66]  They just shoot directly across.
[6222.72 --> 6224.24]  See, I don't even have to kill guys to win.
[6224.60 --> 6226.02]  I'm just, you know...
[6226.02 --> 6226.38]  Uh-oh.
[6227.08 --> 6227.76]  That'll be a problem.
[6228.88 --> 6229.50]  I want to kill them.
[6230.00 --> 6230.98]  Oh, oh, and...
[6230.98 --> 6231.96]  Oh, oh, wow.
[6232.32 --> 6232.68]  Wow.
[6233.60 --> 6235.20]  That was brutal.
[6235.58 --> 6236.64]  Screen went dark.
[6236.82 --> 6237.80]  Not my fault.
[6237.80 --> 6240.06]  I think we can all agree that that was Slick's fault.
[6240.06 --> 6242.22]  Because it's him who configured that computer.
[6243.06 --> 6244.28]  That's your computer.
[6244.72 --> 6246.10]  That's actually your computer.
[6246.10 --> 6248.36]  So I think the real question here is, why were you touching it?
[6248.78 --> 6249.90]  Because I was helping you.
[6250.56 --> 6252.14]  So you admit that you configured the computer.
[6252.14 --> 6252.62]  You just picked up the bomb.
[6252.62 --> 6253.54]  What am I doing?
[6253.90 --> 6255.04]  So the bomb is a buff.
[6255.38 --> 6255.74]  Oh.
[6256.14 --> 6257.34]  Wow, you troll.
[6257.62 --> 6258.42]  No, I didn't know.
[6258.76 --> 6261.46]  I was legit not picking it up, even though you weren't here.
[6263.06 --> 6263.42]  Wow.
[6263.94 --> 6265.88]  I haven't played this game in a while, all right?
[6267.80 --> 6268.56]  Oh, man.
[6268.56 --> 6271.46]  Someone asked if we've been in contact with the Illuminati.
[6272.50 --> 6272.86]  Yeah.
[6273.40 --> 6273.68]  Yes.
[6273.68 --> 6276.08]  Slick and I are like hardcore members of the Illuminati.
[6277.36 --> 6279.48]  Like the, like, Turtles in Time Illuminati.
[6281.16 --> 6283.30]  Ninja Turtles Illuminati should be a thing.
[6283.78 --> 6288.18]  That's why we have, like, seeing eye symbols all over our live streams and stuff.
[6288.72 --> 6289.08]  Do we?
[6289.40 --> 6289.70]  No.
[6289.88 --> 6291.38]  Did you put them there without me seeing them?
[6291.72 --> 6294.30]  I wouldn't be a very good Illuminati if I didn't notice things like that.
[6294.36 --> 6295.94]  Wow, how are they, like...
[6295.94 --> 6297.32]  Their timing is, like, flawless.
[6297.32 --> 6297.52]  Flawless.
[6299.68 --> 6300.50]  Flawless victory.
[6301.98 --> 6303.14]  Those things are pretty crazy.
[6303.48 --> 6306.00]  Yeah, they need to, like, not hit you both ways.
[6307.44 --> 6308.46]  And throwing stars?
[6308.94 --> 6311.72]  Yeah, they apparently just are, like, completely over...
[6311.72 --> 6312.82]  And they kick?
[6313.18 --> 6314.66]  What kind of ninja kicks?
[6314.66 --> 6316.66]  Cheating.
[6320.98 --> 6321.30]  Cheating.
[6322.28 --> 6324.38]  They should have to use their hands, just like me.
[6326.16 --> 6327.88]  Oh, and these ones have bazookas.
[6328.30 --> 6329.74]  Yeah, because that makes a lot of sense.
[6329.78 --> 6331.22]  Who would bring a bazooka to a fight?
[6336.06 --> 6336.38]  Idiots.
[6337.88 --> 6338.58]  And we're dead.
[6339.28 --> 6340.20]  Can we come back in?
[6340.20 --> 6341.68]  No, I don't think so.
[6342.82 --> 6343.72]  Oh, apparently.
[6344.62 --> 6346.26]  Oh, I'm kind of done with this one anyway, aren't you?
[6346.68 --> 6347.02]  Sure.
[6347.16 --> 6348.84]  Should we blow out another thing?
[6349.34 --> 6350.14]  Maybe one last game?
[6350.54 --> 6350.78]  Sure.
[6350.92 --> 6353.26]  All right, why don't we actually listen to the Twitch chat this time?
[6353.26 --> 6359.62]  If everyone's wondering what the heck was just going on, I grabbed my power brick from my laptop,
[6359.86 --> 6364.62]  and it's, like, practically on fire because it was pinched in between a pillow, and that was terrible.
[6366.56 --> 6366.96]  Pillows.
[6367.14 --> 6369.56]  So I was freaking out a little bit.
[6370.46 --> 6370.86]  Wow.
[6373.86 --> 6375.18]  Okay, what game should we play?
[6375.42 --> 6376.06]  Power brick?
[6377.26 --> 6378.00]  This thing.
[6379.88 --> 6381.10]  I don't know what a power brick is.
[6381.44 --> 6383.06]  The guy was like, power brick?
[6383.70 --> 6384.86]  Like, yeah, power brick.
[6385.24 --> 6385.52]  Oh.
[6386.14 --> 6387.96]  No, they don't call them that everywhere.
[6388.60 --> 6389.34]  They call them that.
[6389.50 --> 6390.50]  I know you call them that.
[6390.72 --> 6392.06]  I think that was implied.
[6393.46 --> 6394.92]  You know what was a really good game?
[6395.08 --> 6397.28]  The Power Rangers game for Sega Game Gear.
[6397.96 --> 6399.60]  I played that so much.
[6400.46 --> 6402.18]  I've never played a Sega Game Gear.
[6402.48 --> 6403.22]  Unbelievable amount.
[6403.68 --> 6405.14]  Have they given any input?
[6406.10 --> 6410.22]  Super Smash Brothers, Final Fantasy, Donkey Kong.
[6410.22 --> 6414.18]  People have been asking for Mario Kart sort of all night.
[6414.58 --> 6415.62]  Should we just do Mario Kart?
[6415.70 --> 6416.32]  I don't want to.
[6416.40 --> 6416.80]  Okay, whatever.
[6416.96 --> 6418.58]  Yeah, I don't really want to play Mario Kart either.
[6418.70 --> 6419.14]  Okay, hold on.
[6419.16 --> 6419.68]  What else they got?
[6420.44 --> 6421.50]  We could do Super Punch Out.
[6422.70 --> 6423.06]  Sure.
[6423.06 --> 6424.06]  I...
[6424.06 --> 6425.92]  Alright, let's go with Super Punch Out.
[6426.66 --> 6427.38]  Alright, can you go...
[6427.38 --> 6427.86]  Don't go get the...
[6427.86 --> 6428.82]  Can you go dust it off?
[6433.00 --> 6433.70]  There we go.
[6434.20 --> 6434.78]  We're good.
[6436.06 --> 6436.82]  It'll, uh...
[6436.82 --> 6437.64]  It should work now.
[6437.74 --> 6438.76]  Yeah, you blew it really well.
[6438.94 --> 6439.40]  Yeah, I did.
[6440.50 --> 6441.10]  You know, say...
[6441.10 --> 6442.30]  Blowing it is another thing...
[6442.30 --> 6443.24]  It's another way of saying failure.
[6445.50 --> 6446.76]  That's the other thing that that means.
[6446.76 --> 6447.26]  Wow.
[6450.92 --> 6451.98]  I'm on fire today.
[6452.56 --> 6453.70]  Terrible, terrible fire.
[6455.26 --> 6456.80]  You're like that fire in Tomb Raider.
[6458.16 --> 6460.74]  Yeah, the fire in Tomb Raider is awful.
[6461.10 --> 6462.26]  It's just like...
[6462.26 --> 6463.50]  It's just like...
[6463.50 --> 6464.74]  A flowing, like, texture...
[6466.24 --> 6466.74]  On, like...
[6466.74 --> 6467.92]  What, I think...
[6467.92 --> 6469.00]  Might as well be red water.
[6469.20 --> 6469.52]  Yeah.
[6469.92 --> 6470.86]  It's ridiculous.
[6471.38 --> 6472.58]  Her hair is, like, awesome.
[6472.84 --> 6475.38]  And then right beside it, it's like, oh, that doesn't look very good.
[6475.38 --> 6475.86]  That fire.
[6476.78 --> 6477.58]  That fire.
[6477.82 --> 6478.48]  Super punch-up.
[6478.96 --> 6479.36]  Oh!
[6480.16 --> 6480.84]  Yeah, this game.
[6480.92 --> 6481.58]  I've never played it.
[6482.00 --> 6482.96]  I know this game, though.
[6482.98 --> 6483.12]  Oh, name registration.
[6483.82 --> 6484.76]  Are poo and ass taken?
[6485.88 --> 6486.28]  Wow.
[6486.44 --> 6487.12]  I'm gonna go with...
[6487.12 --> 6488.00]  It's a Simpsons quote.
[6495.58 --> 6495.90]  Okay.
[6496.28 --> 6497.30]  Button setting mode?
[6498.18 --> 6499.06]  Mode select.
[6499.16 --> 6499.48]  Hold on.
[6501.22 --> 6501.62]  What?
[6501.86 --> 6502.56]  Is there not a versus?
[6502.72 --> 6504.22]  I was pretty sure there was a versus in this game.
[6504.62 --> 6505.46]  Just try pressing start.
[6505.46 --> 6506.08]  I did.
[6506.42 --> 6507.18]  I pressed things.
[6508.86 --> 6510.44]  Is this game not two-player?
[6511.92 --> 6512.90]  I thought it was.
[6513.18 --> 6514.56]  You know what's a really good game?
[6515.12 --> 6517.62]  The WWF game for NES.
[6518.50 --> 6519.72]  Have you ever played it?
[6521.26 --> 6522.10]  Holy crap.
[6522.22 --> 6523.08]  It's awesome.
[6523.58 --> 6524.54]  Do you have it?
[6524.96 --> 6527.16]  People are like, no, this is one player.
[6527.50 --> 6527.78]  Oh.
[6528.04 --> 6529.32]  No, no, I don't have it.
[6529.36 --> 6532.20]  We'll have to get it from a game store so we can dust it off next week.
[6532.20 --> 6532.52]  Yeah.
[6533.00 --> 6533.74]  Oh, wow.
[6533.88 --> 6534.70]  Remind me, though.
[6535.04 --> 6536.26]  It is so good.
[6536.48 --> 6536.72]  Okay.
[6536.84 --> 6537.90]  I'll try to remember.
[6538.02 --> 6539.30]  It might not be WWF.
[6539.36 --> 6539.96]  It's just like...
[6539.96 --> 6540.66]  Oh, sorry.
[6540.74 --> 6540.96]  Hold on.
[6541.04 --> 6542.08]  My dust got caught there.
[6542.08 --> 6546.14]  It might just be like some random wrestling game.
[6546.54 --> 6546.74]  Okay.
[6546.74 --> 6548.62]  Let's find something else to dust off.
[6548.96 --> 6549.88]  What do they want?
[6550.06 --> 6550.60]  Should we just...
[6550.60 --> 6550.92]  Should we just...
[6550.92 --> 6554.54]  WrestleMania 2000, Bomberman, Contra...
[6554.54 --> 6557.26]  I don't really know Contra.
[6557.60 --> 6558.02]  Star Fox.
[6558.02 --> 6559.00]  Star Fox is single player.
[6559.70 --> 6561.86]  We don't have any other consoles here right now, guys.
[6561.92 --> 6565.20]  The SNES is like under the table, so there wasn't any room for anything else.
[6565.46 --> 6565.70]  Yeah.
[6566.10 --> 6567.08]  So bear with us here.
[6567.52 --> 6569.38]  Planeside 2 is not a SNES game.
[6569.90 --> 6570.30]  Yeah.
[6570.48 --> 6572.60]  We're going to stick with SNES games for today.
[6573.52 --> 6573.92]  Oh!
[6575.16 --> 6576.08]  NHL PA 93.
[6576.48 --> 6577.06]  Never played it.
[6577.14 --> 6577.28]  Let's do it.
[6577.28 --> 6577.40]  What?
[6577.48 --> 6578.00]  Yes, you have.
[6578.08 --> 6579.30]  It's the one with the wraparounds.
[6581.64 --> 6582.76]  Wasn't that on computer as well?
[6582.78 --> 6583.14]  Nope.
[6584.00 --> 6584.32]  Okay.
[6584.44 --> 6585.68]  The one I was talking about was on computer.
[6585.86 --> 6587.12]  Or NHL 94.
[6587.90 --> 6589.40]  I love this game.
[6589.42 --> 6592.34]  Some NHL game that I played on computer had that exact same move.
[6592.62 --> 6592.86]  Okay.
[6592.88 --> 6593.74]  That's the one I was talking about.
[6593.74 --> 6595.98]  I'm pretty sure it wasn't on computer.
[6597.22 --> 6598.08]  There was an NH...
[6598.08 --> 6598.50]  I don't...
[6598.50 --> 6599.60]  I'm not saying it was this one.
[6599.76 --> 6604.96]  There's just an NHL game that we had on our computer that my dad and my brother and I used to play like crazy.
[6605.50 --> 6605.90]  Oh, wait.
[6605.98 --> 6606.14]  What?
[6606.36 --> 6607.64]  Is this the right game?
[6608.06 --> 6609.48]  No, I don't think this is the right one.
[6609.98 --> 6611.60]  It should be the NHL PA one.
[6613.82 --> 6614.44]  We, uh...
[6614.44 --> 6614.84]  We have...
[6614.84 --> 6616.88]  I can't believe we just had an EA logo on our stream.
[6616.98 --> 6617.64]  That's just...
[6617.64 --> 6618.58]  That was gross.
[6618.72 --> 6619.64]  That was back when they were good.
[6620.44 --> 6621.48]  Were they good at this point?
[6621.48 --> 6622.02]  I don't know.
[6622.02 --> 6625.16]  I don't know, but that's not the game that I...
[6625.16 --> 6627.66]  They were good when they used to make Need for Speed like it should be.
[6629.30 --> 6629.66]  Yeah.
[6629.86 --> 6631.82]  They destroyed that franchise for me.
[6632.14 --> 6634.58]  I used to buy every single Need for Speed game that came out.
[6634.76 --> 6635.22]  Every single one.
[6635.22 --> 6636.04]  There it is.
[6636.68 --> 6638.02]  NHL PA Hockey 93.
[6638.68 --> 6639.04]  Boom.
[6640.04 --> 6641.40]  Someone said Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
[6641.84 --> 6642.88]  I thought that was a NES game.
[6642.88 --> 6645.16]  Uh, I thought that was a book.
[6646.06 --> 6646.68]  Underground 2!
[6646.78 --> 6648.26]  Underground 2 was sick.
[6649.38 --> 6649.92]  There we go.
[6650.02 --> 6650.38]  Underground 2 was so good.
[6650.88 --> 6652.36]  I dusted off the right one this time.
[6652.46 --> 6653.36]  Carbon was good too.
[6653.88 --> 6655.60]  NHL PA Hockey 93.
[6656.62 --> 6659.26]  Pretty much the best game ever made.
[6660.20 --> 6661.06]  Okay, here we go.
[6661.22 --> 6661.74]  Pick your team.
[6662.38 --> 6663.54]  And back then the...
[6663.54 --> 6664.10]  Oh, oh yeah.
[6664.16 --> 6664.82]  Don't change all that.
[6665.26 --> 6665.62]  Hold on.
[6666.26 --> 6666.44]  Okay.
[6666.56 --> 6667.06]  Oh, wait.
[6667.14 --> 6667.28]  Here.
[6667.34 --> 6667.84]  Let me do this.
[6667.84 --> 6668.28]  Let me do this.
[6668.28 --> 6669.16]  Okay.
[6669.58 --> 6670.82]  Uh, regular season.
[6671.16 --> 6671.42]  Yep.
[6672.40 --> 6673.14]  Uh, players.
[6674.18 --> 6674.94]  Head to head.
[6675.48 --> 6675.64]  Okay.
[6675.74 --> 6676.58]  Team 1 is me.
[6677.24 --> 6681.24]  So, I'm gonna be Vancouver because I just refuse to give up on my Canucks even though they're
[6681.24 --> 6682.24]  not actually good in this game.
[6682.96 --> 6684.48]  Uh, teams that are good.
[6685.12 --> 6686.50]  Uh, the Rangers are good.
[6686.58 --> 6687.24]  Here, flip through them.
[6688.78 --> 6689.98]  Uh, Ottawa sucks.
[6690.36 --> 6691.24]  Philadelphia sucks.
[6691.68 --> 6692.00]  Pittsburgh.
[6692.20 --> 6692.80]  Pittsburgh's good.
[6692.80 --> 6695.18]  They have, like, Lemieux and stuff at this point in time.
[6695.60 --> 6695.96]  Sweet.
[6696.16 --> 6696.92]  Okay, so period.
[6696.92 --> 6697.20]  Yeah.
[6697.56 --> 6697.92]  Yeah.
[6698.28 --> 6699.22]  Five minutes.
[6699.40 --> 6699.80]  Penalties.
[6700.02 --> 6700.54]  Only fighting.
[6700.80 --> 6701.46]  Line changes.
[6702.06 --> 6702.34]  On?
[6702.62 --> 6703.60]  Now let's go off, I guess.
[6703.72 --> 6707.24]  Only fighting should just, like, remove the entire game and just make it so that you only
[6707.24 --> 6707.52]  fight.
[6711.14 --> 6712.34]  You had higher numbers.
[6712.92 --> 6713.26]  Unfair.
[6713.86 --> 6714.60]  Okay, here we go.
[6714.62 --> 6715.36]  I don't know how to do anything.
[6715.58 --> 6722.28]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
[6722.28 --> 6723.44]  dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[6723.44 --> 6724.34]  How do I even check?
[6724.94 --> 6725.56]  Uh, I don't know.
[6726.60 --> 6727.42]  A is shoot.
[6727.42 --> 6728.10]  A is pass.
[6728.10 --> 6728.76]  I know that much.
[6728.76 --> 6729.20]  A is shoot.
[6729.20 --> 6729.68]  B is pass.
[6729.68 --> 6729.90]  Okay.
[6729.90 --> 6734.38]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
[6734.38 --> 6737.86]  Oh, and B also passes, like, the, uh, the control of the player.
[6737.86 --> 6742.44]  So I'm going to use, like, Cliff Ronning to check you because that makes a ton of sense.
[6742.44 --> 6743.44]  Go, Linden!
[6743.44 --> 6743.86]  Go, Linden!
[6743.86 --> 6744.02]  Go, Linden!
[6744.02 --> 6745.46]  Slap shot!
[6745.46 --> 6748.04]  Oh, holding A does a bigger shot.
[6751.20 --> 6751.64]  Oh.
[6752.44 --> 6753.24]  Oh, whoops.
[6753.38 --> 6754.22]  That was not good.
[6754.80 --> 6757.88]  That's, uh, that's, uh, Yarmir Jaeger, if I recall correctly.
[6758.70 --> 6760.84]  The guy that I passed the puck to with my goalie.
[6762.18 --> 6762.54]  No!
[6762.54 --> 6762.74]  Oh!
[6764.30 --> 6764.70]  Shoot!
[6764.84 --> 6766.12]  Shoot, Cordell, you loser!
[6767.04 --> 6767.32]  Oh!
[6767.32 --> 6767.50]  Oh!
[6767.50 --> 6768.10]  Gully fell down!
[6768.22 --> 6768.62]  Oh!
[6772.28 --> 6774.64]  Oh, yeah, and check, I think, is, uh, Y.
[6775.22 --> 6775.58]  Y?
[6775.72 --> 6775.92]  Okay.
[6777.92 --> 6779.18]  Jeff Cordell coming on the wing!
[6779.26 --> 6779.54]  Boom!
[6780.28 --> 6780.64]  No?
[6780.80 --> 6781.04]  Okay.
[6781.62 --> 6782.34]  That's how it's going to be.
[6783.22 --> 6783.54]  What the?
[6784.54 --> 6785.28]  Go, Babich!
[6785.32 --> 6787.82]  Babich is, like, the slowest player in the game, as far as I can tell.
[6788.40 --> 6788.72]  Icing.
[6788.92 --> 6789.24]  Icing?
[6789.56 --> 6790.66]  Oh, yeah, icing's a thing.
[6792.50 --> 6795.98]  Someone's like, I'm calling it quits, I'm so tired, and the stream is so boring.
[6796.24 --> 6798.12]  The stream has been super long, too.
[6798.30 --> 6800.92]  He left that, he left the boring part out, but I'm pretty sure it was in pride.
[6801.22 --> 6802.22]  I'm like, go, Yurki Lume!
[6802.40 --> 6802.74]  Yes!
[6802.92 --> 6805.92]  He raced for the icing, even though he's, like, the second slowest player in the game.
[6807.56 --> 6809.80]  The Canucks actually aren't bad in this game.
[6810.06 --> 6810.80]  They're just not that great.
[6812.46 --> 6813.34]  Cliff running, checking!
[6813.82 --> 6814.16]  Yeah!
[6814.16 --> 6815.16]  Oh, whatever!
[6815.80 --> 6816.16]  Bam!
[6816.16 --> 6818.58]  See, your team is so stacked.
[6818.96 --> 6820.04]  I had lower numbers than you.
[6822.14 --> 6822.76]  I think.
[6823.18 --> 6824.04]  I only read the first few.
[6824.74 --> 6825.22]  Are there numbers?
[6825.82 --> 6826.10]  Yeah.
[6826.44 --> 6828.82]  Oh, I just always played Canucks, because they're, like, my team.
[6830.60 --> 6831.40]  Oh, no.
[6832.90 --> 6834.14]  Okay, that makes sense.
[6834.24 --> 6834.94]  How is that not icing?
[6835.08 --> 6835.64]  Go, Cliff running!
[6836.10 --> 6836.70]  Oh, it is.
[6836.78 --> 6837.78]  You just have to get to it.
[6837.84 --> 6838.04]  Oh.
[6838.72 --> 6839.58]  I should start a fight.
[6840.18 --> 6840.54]  Do it.
[6840.58 --> 6841.04]  I don't know how.
[6841.08 --> 6841.74]  I don't know how, either.
[6841.74 --> 6846.12]  I never figured that out in, like, the actual years I played this game.
[6846.46 --> 6847.66]  Never figured that out.
[6851.04 --> 6852.72]  I just pressed Y, like, a billion times.
[6852.84 --> 6853.36]  I think you're right.
[6853.42 --> 6855.32]  I think it is checked, but I think it's just not really.
[6855.42 --> 6855.48]  Oh.
[6855.48 --> 6856.38]  Yeah, it's not that effective.
[6856.92 --> 6857.80]  Oh, you held it for too long.
[6857.96 --> 6858.14]  Oh.
[6858.80 --> 6859.58]  Okay, here we go.
[6859.60 --> 6860.44]  I got a chance to score.
[6860.44 --> 6863.16]  Someone's cheering for me.
[6863.30 --> 6864.18]  Someone says, go Lemieux.
[6864.42 --> 6865.06]  Lemieux's not me.
[6865.48 --> 6866.36]  Come on!
[6867.36 --> 6867.68]  Oh.
[6869.64 --> 6870.16]  Oh, what?
[6871.46 --> 6873.50]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6873.60 --> 6873.76]  Oh.
[6874.36 --> 6874.52]  Oh.
[6875.42 --> 6875.62]  Oh.
[6876.42 --> 6876.74]  Okay.
[6876.92 --> 6877.90]  Let's have a look at the stats.
[6878.00 --> 6880.62]  The stats are an important part of the game.
[6881.24 --> 6882.92]  12 shots to four.
[6883.84 --> 6884.58]  Attacking zone.
[6884.80 --> 6886.50]  I can't believe they got rid of that stat.
[6886.88 --> 6890.14]  But I've had, I don't think it counts, but I've had blind people in front,
[6890.14 --> 6891.48]  and I've taken big slap shots.
[6891.58 --> 6892.06]  You just keep going.
[6893.06 --> 6894.34]  That's the way to score in this game.
[6894.42 --> 6894.82]  I know.
[6896.20 --> 6896.98]  But still.
[6898.22 --> 6900.96]  I've actually had, like, planned shots and stuff.
[6901.56 --> 6902.18]  Okay, well, it's okay.
[6902.24 --> 6903.06]  I have a plan.
[6903.68 --> 6904.46]  I have a plan.
[6907.74 --> 6908.78]  You're going to wrap around.
[6909.60 --> 6910.74]  That's your whole plan.
[6911.88 --> 6912.80]  Get out of here.
[6913.88 --> 6915.32]  How can we not check you?
[6915.40 --> 6916.78]  There's four of us on you.
[6917.02 --> 6917.94]  See your goalie glitches.
[6918.68 --> 6919.00]  Whatever.
[6919.00 --> 6919.36]  Yeah.
[6920.14 --> 6922.14]  Awesome.
[6925.20 --> 6925.46]  Oh, God.
[6925.46 --> 6928.52]  And it's, like, a huge advantage to be a way team in this game.
[6929.04 --> 6932.46]  Because, like, you get the other end of the ice twice.
[6933.74 --> 6934.60]  Oh, God.
[6935.64 --> 6938.90]  Oh, man.
[6941.90 --> 6942.30]  Okay.
[6942.46 --> 6943.64]  EA was good at this point.
[6943.88 --> 6946.28]  For anyone who's wondering what I thought of EA at this point.
[6946.28 --> 6949.86]  Because this game's awesome in spite of its, like, glitched out goalies.
[6951.78 --> 6952.14]  No.
[6952.14 --> 6953.74]  Oh, stopped it again.
[6954.16 --> 6956.46]  You stopped my unstoppable move twice.
[6956.88 --> 6958.26]  Cliff running body check for the win.
[6958.28 --> 6959.64]  How does he keep on missing those?
[6960.34 --> 6960.58]  What?
[6960.94 --> 6961.18]  What?
[6961.18 --> 6961.28]  I see.
[6962.56 --> 6963.66]  You, uh, you dumped it in.
[6963.66 --> 6965.72]  I thought you grabbed it before the line.
[6966.34 --> 6966.94]  Ah, I don't know.
[6967.44 --> 6968.46]  The game doesn't work very well.
[6968.52 --> 6968.76]  It's EA.
[6971.18 --> 6972.00]  Ah, come on.
[6973.42 --> 6975.14]  The cheap wraparound has to go the other way.
[6975.18 --> 6976.00]  I'm kind of doing it wrong.
[6976.00 --> 6982.44]  Wow, if I only manage to score one cheap wraparound goal here, I'm actually kind of in a little bit of trouble.
[6985.28 --> 6986.52]  No, go, Cortnall.
[6987.04 --> 6987.62]  You bum.
[6988.52 --> 6989.70]  Go, Lume, you bum.
[6990.24 --> 6990.64]  Wow.
[6991.24 --> 6992.48]  Way to go, McClane.
[6994.14 --> 6995.36]  Wow, your players suck.
[6995.54 --> 6997.48]  They can't even score on, like, an empty net.
[6997.72 --> 6999.56]  That was pretty much empty, too.
[7000.16 --> 7000.68]  Here we go.
[7001.44 --> 7001.88]  No!
[7003.32 --> 7005.64]  I swear, they fixed the AI for the goalies.
[7006.00 --> 7012.78]  That would have been kind of cool if that weren't there.
[7012.78 --> 7012.86]  What?
[7013.02 --> 7013.80]  What was that?
[7014.06 --> 7014.98]  I have no idea.
[7015.90 --> 7018.22]  All right, Yurki Lume, defenseman of the year.
[7018.98 --> 7023.90]  I don't think he was actually defenseman of the year, but he'd be my defenseman of the year if he scored there.
[7025.42 --> 7025.86]  What?
[7026.32 --> 7027.96]  You just got flattened.
[7027.96 --> 7028.58]  How do you hit?
[7028.66 --> 7030.32]  I just passed into your net.
[7030.96 --> 7031.28]  Wow.
[7032.12 --> 7033.40]  EA goalie AI.
[7033.40 --> 7033.52]  What?
[7033.52 --> 7037.84]  That was ridiculous.
[7038.04 --> 7038.82]  That was a pass.
[7038.88 --> 7042.94]  Not only was it pretty much from the red line, but it was a pass, and it went in the net.
[7043.68 --> 7045.12]  No, that wasn't even from the red line.
[7045.20 --> 7046.54]  That was from my zone, I think.
[7047.68 --> 7049.42]  Okay, stats report, stats report.
[7049.78 --> 7050.10]  Wow.
[7050.10 --> 7053.28]  So the trick is to not shoot at all, or body check.
[7054.02 --> 7054.68]  You're reading.
[7055.52 --> 7056.42]  No, I'm Vancouver.
[7056.58 --> 7058.50]  See, you got more shots in that period than I did.
[7059.00 --> 7059.98]  And more body checks.
[7060.18 --> 7061.98]  Because we were tied for body checks before.
[7062.16 --> 7062.52]  Fourteen, nine.
[7062.68 --> 7063.92]  No, no, but that wasn't for the period.
[7064.00 --> 7064.60]  That's total now.
[7064.68 --> 7065.08]  That's cumulative.
[7065.32 --> 7066.02]  Oh, okay, okay.
[7066.38 --> 7066.66]  Yeah.
[7067.00 --> 7069.44]  Whereas I only got like three shots that period.
[7069.50 --> 7070.56]  It said third...
[7070.56 --> 7071.66]  Oh, I guess we weren't in.
[7071.84 --> 7072.00]  Okay.
[7072.30 --> 7074.00]  Yeah, it's the third period upcoming.
[7074.22 --> 7074.36]  Yeah.
[7074.36 --> 7077.02]  This is...
[7077.02 --> 7079.38]  Seriously, this is golden age stuff right here.
[7080.46 --> 7082.64]  Like back when gaming was awesome.
[7083.84 --> 7087.02]  Well, back when I knew how to play games, which makes it awesome to me.
[7087.92 --> 7089.76]  Okay, McLean, get in your net, please.
[7089.76 --> 7090.26]  What the...
[7090.26 --> 7091.80]  That was a pass for my team.
[7091.82 --> 7092.82]  Oh, oh, running too fast for you.
[7092.98 --> 7093.74]  Running too fast for you.
[7093.74 --> 7094.80]  That was a pass for my team.
[7094.80 --> 7095.44]  Running too fast for you.
[7095.46 --> 7096.70]  So passes for your team's score.
[7096.80 --> 7097.72]  Running too fast.
[7098.84 --> 7099.36]  Goal!
[7099.36 --> 7099.72]  Yeah!
[7101.26 --> 7101.70]  Goal!
[7102.06 --> 7102.46]  Unassisted!
[7102.66 --> 7103.38]  Clef running!
[7103.38 --> 7106.64]  My goalie was the first one to get there and it just teleported in the net.
[7107.16 --> 7108.22]  You know running's like my height?
[7108.44 --> 7109.34]  That's why he's my hero.
[7110.06 --> 7110.40]  Wow.
[7110.44 --> 7111.46]  Because he actually like...
[7111.46 --> 7112.30]  That's a weird reason to have a hero.
[7112.50 --> 7114.76]  Well, he plays in the NHL and he's like five six.
[7114.78 --> 7116.06]  I don't have any heroes that are specifically my height.
[7117.06 --> 7121.18]  Well, your height is like less exceptional in a sport.
[7123.88 --> 7126.88]  It's not like a weird thing to be like six foot.
[7126.88 --> 7129.66]  So you have a hero because you share a common weird thing?
[7129.92 --> 7133.36]  No, because he like worked really hard and against all odds.
[7133.38 --> 7135.06]  He's like able to be an NHLer even though he's small.
[7135.06 --> 7136.60]  So you're saying that your height is a handicap.
[7136.92 --> 7138.94]  I'm saying that to be an NHL...
[7138.94 --> 7140.24]  So basically you're handicapped.
[7140.30 --> 7145.44]  I'm saying that to be an NHL star, yes, it would be a disadvantage to have less reach
[7145.44 --> 7146.26]  than everyone else.
[7146.68 --> 7150.92]  That's not exactly an enlightening thing that like you've never heard of.
[7152.50 --> 7155.28]  McLean, you have got to be kidding me.
[7155.98 --> 7157.28]  How far behind is the stream?
[7157.34 --> 7157.90]  Are you still monitoring?
[7158.76 --> 7159.56]  I was kind of.
[7160.02 --> 7160.56]  Oh, okay.
[7160.94 --> 7164.18]  By the way, I would just like to say I haven't done your cheat wraparound thing at all.
[7165.02 --> 7166.06]  Yeah, and that's why I'm going to win.
[7166.80 --> 7167.84]  Cheating is the way to win.
[7168.08 --> 7169.30]  Actually, I only got one.
[7169.50 --> 7176.22]  So if it's 3-2, then I think that'll prove that the cheat did not cause me to win.
[7176.22 --> 7176.42]  Oh.
[7179.66 --> 7180.14]  Oh.
[7180.48 --> 7182.14]  You also have the way better team.
[7182.26 --> 7183.88]  The Penguins are stacked as balls.
[7183.88 --> 7185.92]  I'm pretty sure yours had higher numbers.
[7186.16 --> 7188.00]  I'm pretty sure that you have...
[7188.00 --> 7189.78]  Okay, okay, here's something to bear in mind too, though.
[7189.80 --> 7190.88]  We're playing no line changes.
[7191.66 --> 7195.36]  So your top line has Jaromir, Jaeger, and Mario Lemieux.
[7197.82 --> 7198.82]  Just saying.
[7199.88 --> 7201.14]  Like, just saying.
[7201.14 --> 7207.44]  My top line's like Cliff Ronning, Trevor Linton, and Jeff Cortnall.
[7207.82 --> 7209.62]  It's like, how many of these guys are Hall of Famers?
[7211.36 --> 7212.10]  Go Ronning!
[7212.48 --> 7213.32]  Come on!
[7213.42 --> 7214.14]  Come on!
[7215.84 --> 7216.46]  Oh, what?
[7216.78 --> 7217.92]  That was a pass.
[7218.88 --> 7220.40]  You know what's my favorite part of this game?
[7220.68 --> 7223.14]  When you win, you can run around and, like, hit the other guys.
[7223.58 --> 7224.54]  That was what was so great about Blitz.
[7224.54 --> 7225.62]  No, no, when you lose, you can.
[7225.72 --> 7226.22]  Oh, right.
[7226.74 --> 7228.04]  Well, I didn't win much, so I wasn't sure.
[7228.08 --> 7228.84]  Did you play Blitz?
[7229.26 --> 7229.56]  No.
[7229.56 --> 7231.20]  Blitz football was amazing.
[7231.34 --> 7232.74]  After every...
[7232.74 --> 7233.70]  My laptop just died.
[7234.02 --> 7234.46]  Oh, did it?
[7235.50 --> 7236.74]  Okay, want to do one more?
[7237.44 --> 7238.38]  You want to pick a different team?
[7238.72 --> 7240.10]  It's like 840.
[7240.24 --> 7240.72]  Is it really?
[7240.74 --> 7242.68]  We've been streaming for, like, four hours.
[7242.78 --> 7243.02]  Okay.
[7244.14 --> 7244.84]  Good night, everyone.
[7245.42 --> 7246.16]  Bye, guys.
[7247.02 --> 7248.34]  That game's so fun, though.
[7248.36 --> 7250.20]  It is fun, but I want to go somewhere that's colder.
[7250.82 --> 7251.60]  It's really warm in here.
[7251.60 --> 7253.36]  It's really freaking hot in here.
[7253.72 --> 7254.46]  What teams are good?
[7256.42 --> 7257.78]  You can't even check the numbers?
[7257.78 --> 7259.76]  No, there are no stats.
[7260.28 --> 7262.64]  Okay, Los Angeles is terrible at this point.
[7263.32 --> 7266.64]  Long Island is, like, the worst team in the game, if I recall correctly.
[7267.88 --> 7268.70]  Hartford's terrible.
[7269.50 --> 7270.80]  Edmonton, I think, is terrible.
[7271.20 --> 7272.24]  Detroit's probably decent.
[7273.12 --> 7274.30]  I think Chicago's pretty good.
[7275.08 --> 7275.74]  Calgary's decent.
[7276.74 --> 7278.28]  Oh, yeah, and you can play all-stars teams.
[7278.28 --> 7280.28]  Okay.
[7282.52 --> 7283.24]  Are we done yet?
[7283.74 --> 7284.16]  I don't know.
[7284.22 --> 7284.74]  Oh, it's still on?
[7285.00 --> 7285.68]  It is still on.
[7286.00 --> 7286.22]  Oh.
[7289.18 --> 7289.78]  It's hot.
[7291.94 --> 7293.96]  I'm dusting off some cartridges for next week.
[7294.32 --> 7296.58]  We keep them all strategically off-camera.
[7296.90 --> 7297.12]  Yeah.
[7297.48 --> 7298.72]  Well, why would you bother?
[7298.88 --> 7300.16]  We've got motherboards on camera.
[7300.32 --> 7300.76]  That's true.
[7300.84 --> 7302.32]  This is a computer tech show.
[7302.46 --> 7302.98]  That's true.
[7303.52 --> 7304.68]  We're not even a gaming show.
[7304.94 --> 7305.12]  No.
[7308.74 --> 7309.80]  Is that a gaming shirt?
[7310.18 --> 7310.96]  Does that say buddy?
[7311.44 --> 7311.76]  Burton.
[7312.20 --> 7312.42]  Oh.
[7313.22 --> 7313.86]  I didn't buy it.
[7315.40 --> 7316.30]  I don't buy shirts.
[7316.58 --> 7317.18]  I know you don't.
[7318.64 --> 7319.88]  Have you bought a shirt?
[7320.40 --> 7323.96]  Technically, because I bought a lot of stuff for the freaking Computex.
[7324.08 --> 7324.44]  Right.
[7324.44 --> 7328.32]  So you bought nice clothes, but have you bought a t-shirt in the last five years?
[7333.96 --> 7334.32]  No.
[7334.82 --> 7339.10]  Does it count as buying a t-shirt if you enter a tournament that you paid to enter and they
[7339.10 --> 7340.12]  give you a t-shirt for entering?
[7344.54 --> 7346.62]  If that's a yes, then yes.
[7346.70 --> 7348.16]  If that's a no, then no.
[7349.44 --> 7349.80]  What?
[7350.18 --> 7351.92]  Because I've gotten shirts from tournaments.
[7351.92 --> 7352.40]  No, no.
[7352.44 --> 7353.22]  I mean for myself.
[7353.34 --> 7354.56]  I'm trying to figure out if I've bought a shirt.
[7354.70 --> 7355.62]  I would say no.
[7355.80 --> 7356.30]  You'd say no.
[7356.40 --> 7356.88]  That doesn't count.
[7357.04 --> 7358.06]  Is that your badminton shirt?
[7358.18 --> 7358.36]  Yeah.
[7358.62 --> 7358.90]  Yeah.
[7359.02 --> 7361.98]  No, I'd say no because what you're paying for is to participate in the tournament.
[7362.08 --> 7363.80]  You're not like, I don't want to do this.
[7363.86 --> 7364.56]  Oh, there's a shirt.
[7364.70 --> 7365.54]  Yeah, I'm going to do this.
[7365.92 --> 7366.14]  Okay.
[7366.14 --> 7367.44]  I'm pretty sure you're doing it for the tournament.
[7368.84 --> 7369.54]  I don't know.
[7370.30 --> 7372.02]  Did you play in that tournament for the shirt?
[7372.14 --> 7372.46]  No.
[7372.88 --> 7373.20]  Exactly.
[7373.50 --> 7376.16]  No, the tournament, they give you a different color shirt if you win.
[7376.40 --> 7377.52]  Those are the shirts you play for.
[7378.12 --> 7378.36]  Oh.
[7379.36 --> 7379.72]  Oh.
[7379.94 --> 7380.06]  Still no then.
[7380.06 --> 7381.26]  So there's a participation shirt.
[7381.26 --> 7382.00]  Still no then.
[7382.00 --> 7382.32]  Okay, okay.
[7382.38 --> 7382.90]  So still no.
[7383.38 --> 7388.70]  These Zotac shirts, I own like four of them because there was like a pile and I was like,
[7388.78 --> 7389.78]  oh, these are kind of nice.
[7390.48 --> 7390.84]  Yoink.
[7390.98 --> 7391.24]  Yeah.
[7392.46 --> 7394.70]  And then my everyday I'm shuttling shirts.
[7394.88 --> 7395.84]  Those are badminton shirts.
[7396.50 --> 7398.28]  My game over shirt was given to me.
[7398.70 --> 7399.60]  Everyday I'm shuttling.
[7399.98 --> 7401.14]  I thought you bought that though.
[7401.36 --> 7401.60]  Nope.
[7402.10 --> 7402.68]  That was from a tournament?
[7402.88 --> 7403.06]  Yep.
[7403.30 --> 7403.50]  Cool.
[7403.50 --> 7403.58]  Cool.
[7403.58 --> 7406.36]  Do do do do do do do do.
[7406.36 --> 7408.26]  Do do do do do do.
[7408.66 --> 7409.86]  Do do do do do do.
[7410.86 --> 7411.02]  Do do do do do do.
[7411.02 --> 7411.56]  Do do do do do.
[7411.56 --> 7413.14]  So it goes like streams not on YouTube.
[7413.14 --> 7418.50]  We've been here the whole time.
[7419.46 --> 7419.74]  Wow.
[7419.74 --> 7421.34]  Look at look at Ottawa's stats.
[7422.38 --> 7422.78]  Wow.
[7422.88 --> 7423.88]  See, I told you there was stats.
[7423.92 --> 7424.40]  Oh, no, no.
[7424.48 --> 7425.16]  I believe you.
[7425.22 --> 7426.86]  It's just that your top line was stacked.
[7426.92 --> 7427.10]  Yeah.
[7427.82 --> 7427.96]  Yeah.
[7429.06 --> 7429.46]  Wow.
[7429.60 --> 7432.80]  Fighting for everything else.
[7433.00 --> 7433.22]  Wait.
[7433.26 --> 7435.52]  Do you really think they have individual stats for players?
[7435.62 --> 7436.16]  I doubt that.
[7436.22 --> 7436.46]  Mm-hmm.
[7436.78 --> 7437.08]  Really?
[7437.42 --> 7437.76]  Yeah.
[7438.00 --> 7438.32]  Wow.
[7438.44 --> 7439.94]  That's surprisingly advanced.
[7440.02 --> 7442.60]  Remember I was telling you like some of my players were like really slow?
[7443.30 --> 7443.66]  Right.
[7443.72 --> 7444.66]  Some of them have better shots.
[7444.82 --> 7444.94]  Right.
[7444.94 --> 7446.36]  Some of them have more powerful checking.
[7446.74 --> 7447.18]  Interesting.
[7447.38 --> 7447.58]  Yeah.
[7448.54 --> 7451.54]  They should totally release like a roster update for this game.
[7452.36 --> 7453.82]  That would be awesome.
[7454.06 --> 7455.52]  How would you even do it though?
[7455.70 --> 7457.68]  You could do it as like a virtual console game.
[7458.38 --> 7458.78]  Oh, yeah.
[7458.78 --> 7458.96]  Okay.
[7458.96 --> 7462.40]  And you could do like original roster, new NHL roster.
[7463.22 --> 7463.54]  Oh.
[7464.68 --> 7466.18]  That would be so awesome.
[7466.46 --> 7466.94]  Oh, sweet.
[7467.04 --> 7469.94]  Like playing as like Sidney Crosby in like...
[7469.94 --> 7475.46]  I love how the graphics for fans like haven't even gotten that much better than this.
[7476.88 --> 7479.62]  At least there are more different sprites now.
[7479.92 --> 7481.24]  See, because there's like four.
[7481.62 --> 7481.88]  Yeah.
[7482.12 --> 7484.06]  Okay, so there's an old dude with gray hair.
[7484.48 --> 7488.82]  And then there's an older lady with a yellow shirt.
[7491.52 --> 7495.50]  There's a younger lady with brown hair and a white shirt.
[7496.46 --> 7499.52]  And all the players are like the same.
[7500.76 --> 7501.70]  Like look at the bench.
[7501.90 --> 7503.04]  Yeah, the bench is awesome.
[7503.26 --> 7505.36]  Zero activity on the bench whatsoever.
[7506.88 --> 7509.24]  But seriously, there's some sports games.
[7509.24 --> 7512.62]  There's some sports games where they're just like, you can't really see them.
[7513.02 --> 7514.62]  Some of them, I love it when they're 2D.
[7515.22 --> 7515.38]  Yeah.
[7515.48 --> 7521.40]  So like, especially racing games, when the fans are 2D and you're like coming along and you're like, yeah, I can see through you right now.
[7521.40 --> 7521.50]  That's weird.
[7521.50 --> 7524.88]  It's only when you're looking at them dead on that they're somewhat convincing.
[7525.36 --> 7527.30]  This is what consoles do to us.
[7528.58 --> 7529.38]  Except for this one.
[7529.42 --> 7530.88]  Except for this console, which was awesome.
[7532.12 --> 7533.38]  Apparently that's the trick.
[7533.84 --> 7535.00]  See, you're watching the demo.
[7535.10 --> 7535.98]  They just go in circles.
[7536.50 --> 7537.34]  That's D-King.
[7537.34 --> 7540.82]  You know, it's funny because the reason I like...
[7540.82 --> 7540.96]  Whoa!
[7541.10 --> 7542.78]  He just shot back!
[7543.78 --> 7545.12]  Almost hit the net too.
[7546.34 --> 7550.14]  What if everyone was your pass from like your zone that just went in?
[7550.24 --> 7551.44]  Hey, that was the game winning goal.
[7553.62 --> 7554.10]  Awesome.
[7555.34 --> 7557.10]  It's kind of why I like old games though.
[7557.24 --> 7558.34]  It's like...
[7558.34 --> 7560.96]  It's not actually as calculated.
[7560.96 --> 7562.96]  New games are so like...
[7562.96 --> 7563.02]  And it is calculated.
[7563.02 --> 7563.36]  It's weird.
[7563.80 --> 7568.04]  Like you can actually set up like passing plays in new NHL games.
[7568.14 --> 7569.22]  I'm just like...
[7569.22 --> 7572.28]  I actually don't understand the sport well enough to play this game.
[7572.38 --> 7573.34]  I'm just trying to play a game.
[7573.90 --> 7576.24]  Like I just want to like skate the guy down.
[7576.54 --> 7577.96]  End to end with the defenseman.
[7579.28 --> 7579.96]  Cheap wraparound.
[7580.68 --> 7581.98]  And I should get a goal for that.
[7583.44 --> 7584.22]  It's like...
[7584.22 --> 7586.32]  I can defend both though.
[7586.56 --> 7587.86]  But it would be nice if there's like...
[7587.86 --> 7588.96]  There should be noob mode.
[7589.60 --> 7590.32]  Like noob mode?
[7590.32 --> 7591.26]  There might even be.
[7591.38 --> 7595.00]  Where the AI just like all gets hit in the head with like a hammer.
[7596.54 --> 7597.94]  It's like a derp.
[7598.52 --> 7600.08]  Randomly runs into boards and stuff.
[7600.38 --> 7601.62]  It would be cool if there was noob mode.
[7601.72 --> 7602.16]  Because like...
[7602.16 --> 7603.60]  Okay, I don't really play sports games.
[7604.14 --> 7606.86]  I would rather go play this board or play other types of video games.
[7606.94 --> 7607.24]  Personally.
[7607.80 --> 7609.52]  I understand why people do.
[7609.60 --> 7610.66]  I'm just not super into it.
[7611.04 --> 7611.32]  But like...
[7611.86 --> 7612.66]  Maybe there is.
[7612.72 --> 7613.54]  Maybe there isn't noob mode.
[7613.62 --> 7615.36]  But like my favorite football game was Blitz.
[7615.88 --> 7617.22]  It's the only football game I ever really played.
[7617.28 --> 7619.02]  Because it was just nuts.
[7619.02 --> 7619.06]  Blitz.
[7619.88 --> 7621.70]  Like it wasn't realistic football at all.
[7621.80 --> 7623.26]  You could just destroy people.
[7623.60 --> 7628.14]  And after every single play, if you just spammed all your buttons, everyone would just basically kill each other.
[7628.96 --> 7631.22]  Like everyone would just go nuts and dive all over the place.
[7631.30 --> 7634.88]  So after every single play when you're playing someone, everybody would just be flattened all of a sudden.
[7634.88 --> 7639.46]  Nowadays, everyone worries about like, you know, the sportsmanship and like...
[7639.46 --> 7640.28]  Yeah, because...
[7640.28 --> 7640.86]  The perception.
[7641.16 --> 7645.96]  A future version of Blitz, if one of your guys got injured, you could just like tell him to take morphine and go out into the game.
[7646.44 --> 7649.08]  And then he could get more injured and like break a leg and stuff.
[7649.16 --> 7650.68]  And he'd just be like, oh, you just lost a player.
[7650.88 --> 7652.14]  And everyone freaked out.
[7652.22 --> 7653.48]  But like, that's Blitz.
[7654.18 --> 7655.40]  To me, that's Blitz.
[7655.44 --> 7656.74]  Because you're just...
[7656.74 --> 7657.32]  You're nuts.
[7657.42 --> 7659.32]  I mean, that's why they can't make Carmageddon again.
[7661.32 --> 7661.72]  Like...
[7661.72 --> 7664.24]  The steroid simulator.
[7664.44 --> 7665.20]  Yeah, NFL Blitz.
[7665.30 --> 7666.00]  The steroid simulator.
[7666.22 --> 7667.60]  It's basically just crazy.
[7668.06 --> 7669.18]  Or like Bad News Bears.
[7669.50 --> 7671.48]  Like, can you imagine if someone made that movie today?
[7673.60 --> 7679.04]  Like, it's funny because they're allowed to be classics because, oh, it was a different time back then.
[7679.04 --> 7681.92]  But like now, like, can you imagine?
[7682.08 --> 7682.76]  Have you seen the movie?
[7683.26 --> 7683.88]  I think so.
[7684.14 --> 7685.40]  I think it's just been a really long time.
[7685.40 --> 7689.80]  It's like racist and sexist and it's like...
[7689.80 --> 7690.38]  It's just...
[7690.38 --> 7692.80]  It's Walter Matthau being like Walter Matthau.
[7692.90 --> 7694.74]  Apparently they are making Carmageddon again.
[7694.86 --> 7695.84]  It'll probably be super...
[7695.84 --> 7697.28]  No, it's a Kickstarter or something.
[7697.60 --> 7697.68]  Like...
[7697.68 --> 7698.10]  Oh, okay.
[7698.18 --> 7701.16]  Like, no actual studio would fund that game.
[7701.52 --> 7702.86]  Because they'd be just terrified.
[7704.08 --> 7706.20]  Like, first Australia would ban it.
[7706.56 --> 7708.98]  And then everyone would ban it.
[7709.76 --> 7711.00]  Well, they wouldn't ban it.
[7711.04 --> 7712.24]  But it would just be...
[7712.24 --> 7712.50]  Yeah.
[7712.64 --> 7715.38]  I thought it would have been so interesting if Australia and Germany...
[7715.38 --> 7717.12]  Germany banned Xbox One.
[7717.38 --> 7718.02]  Did you hear about that?
[7718.26 --> 7721.78]  Yeah, I heard Germany was going to because you couldn't turn off...
[7721.78 --> 7722.98]  You couldn't turn off the thing.
[7722.98 --> 7723.52]  And like...
[7723.52 --> 7724.62]  Privacy something rather.
[7724.78 --> 7725.02]  Yeah.
[7725.36 --> 7726.60]  That would have been so interesting.
[7727.16 --> 7727.58]  Yeah.
[7731.16 --> 7734.90]  Because not only would that have created the dynamic of like, oh, wow, you created something
[7734.90 --> 7737.06]  that got banned in two major countries.
[7737.62 --> 7740.22]  But users in those countries that would have wanted it.
[7741.46 --> 7743.14]  And the fact that it was going to be region locked.
[7743.22 --> 7744.06]  I mean, that was the craziest thing.
[7744.30 --> 7744.74]  You know what's funny?
[7744.78 --> 7747.54]  A lot of people brought up when I was talking about like China.
[7748.04 --> 7748.94]  And like region locking.
[7749.06 --> 7749.72]  And I was like, what?
[7749.76 --> 7750.80]  You're not going to sell it in China?
[7750.98 --> 7751.26]  I know.
[7751.36 --> 7751.54]  Yeah.
[7751.90 --> 7752.92]  Consoles are banned in China.
[7753.00 --> 7753.60]  You can't buy them.
[7753.64 --> 7754.54]  But come on!
[7755.84 --> 7756.14]  Yeah.
[7756.14 --> 7758.12]  People don't own consoles in China.
[7758.22 --> 7759.32]  Are you frigging kidding me?
[7759.84 --> 7762.62]  The gray market for consoles in China is like...
[7762.62 --> 7763.64]  Probably huge.
[7763.76 --> 7764.56]  ...through the roof.
[7764.58 --> 7764.80]  Yeah.
[7765.02 --> 7766.44]  There are plenty of consoles in China.
[7766.56 --> 7767.42]  Let me tell you.
[7768.28 --> 7770.24]  I'll tell you what, Hank Hill style.
[7771.52 --> 7773.14]  It's like, you don't think there's consoles?
[7773.26 --> 7774.06]  That's asinine.
[7776.36 --> 7778.16]  I can't do a good Hank Hill voice though.
[7779.02 --> 7779.90]  This is great.
[7780.00 --> 7784.24]  Having the stream playing over there is like instant replay built in to...
[7784.24 --> 7787.82]  Everyone should just get two TVs and put one on a time delay.
[7788.02 --> 7789.38]  That way if you miss anything...
[7789.38 --> 7789.98]  You can just...
[7789.98 --> 7790.06]  You can just...
[7790.06 --> 7792.06]  You can just...
[7792.06 --> 7796.08]  You can just start selling time delay TVs that you can like attach to the side of your TV.
[7796.16 --> 7796.46]  Yeah.
[7796.84 --> 7797.38]  So it's like...
[7797.38 --> 7798.86]  It doesn't have to be as big really.
[7798.94 --> 7800.64]  And then you should just have like an audio switcher.
[7801.34 --> 7802.76]  So if you're just like, oh, I missed that.
[7802.96 --> 7804.60]  You switch over to the delay TV.
[7804.94 --> 7805.12]  Yeah.
[7805.54 --> 7806.42]  And then...
[7806.42 --> 7807.50]  Oh, but then what would you do?
[7807.56 --> 7811.06]  The delay TV would have to like automatically play...
[7811.06 --> 7811.74]  Replace the other one.
[7811.74 --> 7816.70]  No, it would have to play at like 20% faster until it catches up.
[7816.80 --> 7819.32]  And then you could switch back to your main TV because your delay TV would be smaller.
[7820.30 --> 7821.96]  Well, you could have your stream swap.
[7823.72 --> 7824.08]  Oh, like you actually switch.
[7824.08 --> 7826.88]  So while you're watching the delay TV, you could pop it over.
[7827.08 --> 7828.62]  Oh, you could catch up during a commercial break.
[7828.98 --> 7829.22]  Yeah.
[7829.98 --> 7832.38]  So you could have your delay TV switch over to your main one.
[7832.44 --> 7833.76]  Your main one switch over to delay TV.
[7833.94 --> 7835.62]  I think what we're describing is called TiVo.
[7836.44 --> 7836.94]  Is it?
[7837.20 --> 7837.70]  Kind of.
[7837.92 --> 7838.26]  Yeah.
[7838.26 --> 7839.86]  Like being able to rewind.
[7839.86 --> 7841.76]  But then you don't have to actually...
[7841.76 --> 7843.32]  You don't actually have to rewind.
[7845.32 --> 7846.88]  Why all this extra hardware?
[7847.62 --> 7849.68]  The laziest TiVo ever.
[7850.24 --> 7851.30]  Yeah, I don't want to rewind.
[7851.48 --> 7852.88]  I want it to be all live.
[7852.88 --> 7854.50]  Yeah, rewinding is for chumps.
[7854.74 --> 7854.84]  Yeah.
[7855.02 --> 7858.38]  It's like, I haven't rewound anything since VHS days.
[7858.38 --> 7860.38]  What?
[7861.10 --> 7862.12]  Oh, we have game sound now.
[7862.18 --> 7863.42]  I think, like, the stream broke.
[7864.04 --> 7864.84]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7864.86 --> 7867.10]  Because when that thing changes over.
[7867.50 --> 7868.84]  That's what the game sound sounds like.
[7868.88 --> 7869.36]  It's awesome.
[7869.56 --> 7870.02]  Like, boo.
[7870.80 --> 7871.02]  Boo.
[7872.02 --> 7872.34]  Boo.
[7872.34 --> 7872.74]  Ah.
[7873.60 --> 7873.88]  Ah.
[7875.76 --> 7876.16]  TiVo.
[7876.20 --> 7878.30]  Everyone's confused as to what TiVo is.
[7878.36 --> 7878.72]  TiVo?
[7878.80 --> 7879.64]  It's just a DVR.
[7879.76 --> 7879.96]  Yeah.
[7880.34 --> 7880.78]  PVR.
[7881.48 --> 7881.84]  Whatever.
[7882.06 --> 7882.72]  It's a VR.
[7883.20 --> 7884.36]  Not virtual reality.
[7884.72 --> 7885.30]  I wish it was.
[7885.36 --> 7885.96]  Yeah, I think we're done.
[7886.38 --> 7886.62]  Yeah.
[7886.92 --> 7887.44]  Good night, everyone.
[7887.44 --> 7888.38]  Thanks for watching.
