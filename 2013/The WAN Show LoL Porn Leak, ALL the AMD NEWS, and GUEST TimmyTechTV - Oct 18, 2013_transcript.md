[0.56 --> 6.40]  Alright, I do believe we're live and tried to be two minutes beforehand just like last
[6.40 --> 12.64]  week but almost failed because our person that does the art things decided to kind of
[12.64 --> 14.90]  not do the art things this week.
[14.90 --> 19.02]  So I had to kind of ghetto rig a picture together for our guest.
[19.02 --> 24.96]  So if you look at the guest picture, it's actually the same one from last week.
[24.96 --> 26.68]  This one's wrong unfortunately.
[26.68 --> 29.64]  The Linus Tech thing is wrong unfortunately.
[29.64 --> 34.76]  And then that's actually TotalBiscuits picture and I added another source file and then
[34.76 --> 39.52]  like sized it over top of that one and then I did a screen capture of the TimmyTechTV
[39.52 --> 43.80]  thing and then added that one and like resized it and put it on top and I like...
[43.80 --> 45.02]  Looks good though.
[45.02 --> 46.02]  It's super ghetto rigged.
[46.02 --> 47.02]  End result.
[47.02 --> 48.02]  Doesn't matter.
[48.02 --> 49.02]  End result.
[49.02 --> 50.02]  It worked.
[50.02 --> 51.02]  Wins.
[51.02 --> 52.02]  We're good.
[52.02 --> 53.02]  Yeah.
[53.02 --> 54.02]  So I was pretty happy with that which is cool.
[54.02 --> 57.02]  Um, we've got some really interesting stuff this week.
[57.02 --> 58.42]  Like seriously interesting stuff.
[58.42 --> 59.30]  The GPU wars.
[59.30 --> 60.46]  Like we talked about this last week.
[60.46 --> 61.46]  The GPU wars.
[61.46 --> 62.46]  Uh huh.
[62.46 --> 63.66]  Where it was a big thing last week.
[63.66 --> 66.70]  This week the GPU wars are on a completely different level.
[66.70 --> 67.70]  Like they're...
[67.70 --> 70.98]  Last week they were like, hmm yes, dueling gloves.
[70.98 --> 75.54]  This week they're like grunge, gorilla fighting, we're gonna kill you all.
[75.54 --> 76.54]  It's ridiculous.
[76.54 --> 77.54]  Um...
[77.54 --> 78.70]  They're macroing pretty hard.
[78.70 --> 79.70]  They're macroing pretty hard.
[79.70 --> 80.78]  They're microing also there though.
[80.78 --> 81.78]  They're not just macroing.
[81.78 --> 82.78]  They're not just macroing.
[82.78 --> 83.78]  They're starting to show up.
[83.78 --> 84.78]  They're not just macroing for a long time.
[84.78 --> 86.82]  That was when they were building the graphics cards.
[86.82 --> 88.82]  They're making the graphics cards.
[88.82 --> 89.82]  But now they're both releasing.
[89.82 --> 90.82]  So they're doing the microing.
[90.82 --> 93.82]  They're trying to get all the cards to all the different stores and position them and
[93.82 --> 94.82]  everything.
[94.82 --> 95.82]  They haven't started trading yet though.
[95.82 --> 96.82]  We'll have to see.
[96.82 --> 98.54]  Yeah, they haven't been trading much.
[98.54 --> 101.66]  For people that are wondering about the rocket info, that's Linus' cat.
[101.66 --> 103.06]  He is home.
[103.06 --> 105.02]  The whole operation is complete.
[105.02 --> 109.82]  We contacted the dude that got us in contact with the girl and then I got Linus' wife in
[109.82 --> 114.10]  contact with the girl and Linus' wife went down there immediately and got the cat.
[114.10 --> 116.06]  He's very thin.
[116.06 --> 117.06]  Like incredibly thin.
[117.06 --> 121.82]  But he's home and he's happy and he's hanging out with Rumble and Rumble is all ridiculously
[121.82 --> 122.82]  happy.
[122.82 --> 123.82]  So the cats are all happy.
[123.82 --> 124.82]  The cats are all together.
[124.82 --> 126.82]  We're going to get him fed.
[126.82 --> 127.82]  Yeah.
[127.82 --> 128.82]  Apparently he's pretty skinny right now.
[128.82 --> 129.82]  So yeah.
[129.82 --> 133.82]  We're going to get him fed a lot hopefully so he can get some of that weight back because
[133.82 --> 138.44]  he's at an unhealthy, probably unhealthy level of weight right now which is not good.
[138.44 --> 140.74]  But the cat's back.
[140.74 --> 142.68]  The GPU wars are on.
[142.68 --> 148.06]  Some dude that plays League of Legends leaked his girlfriend's photos on his Facebook.
[148.06 --> 149.20]  Are we starting with that right away?
[149.20 --> 150.58]  No, we're not starting with that right away.
[150.58 --> 151.58]  I'm just doing the talking topics.
[151.58 --> 152.58]  Oh, okay.
[152.58 --> 153.58]  My bad.
[153.58 --> 156.58]  I'm going to talk about that later because I'm assuming you're on the same team as me.
[156.58 --> 157.58]  Yeah.
[157.58 --> 158.58]  Move a little closer.
[158.58 --> 159.58]  I feel like I'm dominating the...
[159.58 --> 160.58]  Hey buddy.
[160.58 --> 161.58]  How's it going?
[161.58 --> 163.58]  And then Blizzard's dropping bombs.
[163.58 --> 165.58]  So I think those are our main topics.
[165.58 --> 166.58]  I'm really excited about that.
[166.58 --> 167.58]  The cat's back.
[167.58 --> 168.58]  GP wars are on.
[168.58 --> 173.58]  Blizzard's dropping bombs and some jerk face posted his girlfriend's pictures on the Facebook.
[173.58 --> 175.58]  So we're going to run the intro and hope it works.
[175.58 --> 176.58]  And it didn't.
[176.58 --> 188.58]  I know why that didn't work too.
[188.58 --> 192.76]  It didn't work because it's trying to run off of something that it's no longer connected
[192.76 --> 198.58]  to because Linus was running media files off the server instead of off the local computer.
[198.58 --> 199.58]  Which is like...
[199.58 --> 201.58]  I was trying to figure out why.
[201.58 --> 202.58]  Probably not the best idea.
[202.58 --> 203.58]  I should probably just have a little bit of it.
[203.58 --> 204.58]  We just went with it.
[204.58 --> 205.58]  There we go.
[205.58 --> 206.58]  Oh!
[206.58 --> 207.58]  Oh!
[207.58 --> 208.58]  Oh!
[208.58 --> 209.58]  Oh!
[209.58 --> 210.58]  Oh!
[210.58 --> 211.58]  Oh!
[211.58 --> 212.58]  Oh!
[212.58 --> 213.58]  Oh!
[213.58 --> 214.58]  Oh!
[214.58 --> 215.58]  Oh!
[215.58 --> 216.58]  Oh!
[216.58 --> 217.58]  Oh!
[217.58 --> 218.58]  Oh!
[218.58 --> 219.58]  Oh!
[219.58 --> 220.58]  Oh!
[220.58 --> 221.58]  Oh!
[221.58 --> 222.58]  Oh!
[222.58 --> 223.58]  Oh!
[223.58 --> 224.58]  Oh!
[224.58 --> 225.58]  Oh!
[225.58 --> 226.58]  Oh!
[226.58 --> 227.58]  Oh!
[227.58 --> 228.58]  Oh!
[228.58 --> 229.58]  Oh!
[229.58 --> 230.58]  Oh!
[230.58 --> 231.58]  I don't have Razer comms anymore.
[231.58 --> 232.58]  No.
[232.58 --> 235.58]  But we still kind of have their branding everywhere because that art dude.
[235.58 --> 236.58]  Too lazy.
[236.58 --> 237.58]  I swear.
[237.58 --> 240.58]  Um, that's why I wear my Beardynamics now.
[240.58 --> 241.58]  No big deal.
[241.58 --> 244.58]  Um, I got a lot of call outs for that last week.
[244.58 --> 245.58]  I love these.
[245.58 --> 246.58]  They're awesome.
[246.58 --> 247.58]  The bass is incredible.
[247.58 --> 248.58]  The bass is incredible.
[248.58 --> 250.58]  And the bass port is really cool too.
[250.58 --> 255.58]  And as someone who has always idolized bass, someone who might have two 12s in his truck,
[255.58 --> 259.58]  that's, uh, you know, having a bass style headphone is really cool.
[259.58 --> 262.58]  They sound not as good as your open ear Sennheiser.
[262.58 --> 263.58]  Yeah.
[263.58 --> 264.58]  I forget which model number.
[264.58 --> 265.58]  Um, 595s.
[265.58 --> 270.58]  But basically, if, don't necessarily buy 595s, buy the 555s and then remove the little thing
[270.58 --> 271.58]  and they're the same.
[271.58 --> 272.58]  You got some sales in your chair.
[272.58 --> 275.58]  I got a crazy sale so they were cheaper than 555s, which is redonkey dink and that doesn't
[275.58 --> 276.58]  actually really happen.
[276.58 --> 278.58]  So, that was lucky.
[278.58 --> 282.58]  Um, let's jump below the guest topics and talk first about Riva Tuner.
[282.58 --> 287.58]  Before we actually get into like the juicy GPU versus GPU wars that we're going to be
[287.58 --> 290.58]  getting in and talking about later, we're going to start with Riva Tuner.
[290.58 --> 295.58]  So, what Riva Tuner is, is basically it's the back end for a lot of what you guys use
[295.58 --> 296.58]  for graphics card overclocking.
[296.58 --> 300.58]  So, I'm going to actually just focus on two right now, but it's basically the back end
[300.58 --> 301.58]  for everything.
[301.58 --> 305.58]  Um, afterburner and EVGA's Precision.
[305.58 --> 306.58]  There we go.
[306.58 --> 307.58]  X-Precision thing.
[307.58 --> 309.58]  Um, I couldn't remember what it was called for a second.
[309.58 --> 317.58]  So, the news going on about this is that it's Riva Tuner won't support 64-bit or X64.
[317.58 --> 320.58]  It will support 64-bit.
[320.58 --> 321.58]  You can still overclock your graphics card.
[321.58 --> 325.58]  What won't work, there was a bunch of hype about that, what won't work is the overlay
[325.58 --> 328.58]  I was wondering why there's so much hype about that.
[328.58 --> 330.58]  I was like, dude, we've had 64-bit operating systems.
[330.58 --> 333.58]  You're probably running one right now.
[333.58 --> 335.58]  And you're probably overclocking on it right now.
[335.58 --> 336.58]  Why are you freaking out?
[336.58 --> 337.58]  Yeah.
[337.58 --> 338.58]  Anyways, so, no big deal.
[338.58 --> 344.58]  But, what's not going to work is the OSD, the on-screen display in the top left-hand corner.
[344.58 --> 349.58]  Which, while that does kind of suck, is not like super big deal.
[349.58 --> 350.58]  It's not breaking.
[350.58 --> 351.58]  No.
[351.58 --> 355.58]  I really don't feel like it's, you know, and a lot of people look for FPS.
[355.58 --> 356.58]  Stuff like that.
[356.58 --> 357.58]  Fraps is a great way.
[357.58 --> 358.58]  Fraps shows FPS.
[358.58 --> 361.58]  There was one thing that was suggested by the person who posted this on the forum.
[361.58 --> 364.58]  Actually, if we can jump, if you can bring it up, that would be great.
[364.58 --> 369.58]  That is the, if you scroll up a little bit and go to the Riva Tuner thing right under guest topics.
[369.58 --> 371.58]  So go down below guest topics.
[371.58 --> 372.58]  Sorry guys.
[372.58 --> 374.58]  Riva Tuner right there.
[374.58 --> 375.58]  Yep.
[375.58 --> 376.58]  And bring up the post on the forum.
[376.58 --> 380.58]  Just because I want to give a shout out to the dude who actually posted this on the forum.
[380.58 --> 381.58]  Once it loads.
[381.58 --> 382.58]  Sorry guys.
[382.58 --> 385.58]  I actually, I guess while it's loading, I had everything open.
[385.58 --> 387.58]  Then I realized there was no way I could navigate through all these tabs.
[387.58 --> 388.58]  Yeah.
[388.58 --> 389.58]  Yeah.
[389.58 --> 390.58]  Here we go.
[390.58 --> 391.58]  We, we have made it.
[391.58 --> 395.58]  Chris XLX Cross, I believe is the name of the guy that posted on the forum.
[395.58 --> 398.58]  And he had a suggestion and that was Play Claw.
[398.58 --> 400.58]  Uh, you can find it by going to playclaw.com.
[400.58 --> 403.58]  I checked it out very briefly by looking at the video and stuff.
[403.58 --> 404.58]  Fairly interesting.
[404.58 --> 408.58]  Um, I haven't actually installed it, but it's fairly interesting.
[408.58 --> 412.58]  And the, the guy that made Riva Tuner, which you guys can see on screen right now and still
[412.58 --> 417.58]  maintains it, has basically said he's busy working on a whole bunch of other stuff.
[417.58 --> 420.58]  And while this is in his pipeline, it's very low priority in his pipeline.
[420.58 --> 421.58]  So it will be done eventually.
[421.58 --> 430.58]  Um, but as there's not a ton of 64-bit required games, um, it's just, it's just not a huge deal
[430.58 --> 431.58]  right now.
[431.58 --> 436.58]  He's focusing on other stuff like prepping for, um, the Hawaii cards, which he's still, I'm
[436.58 --> 439.58]  refining things for, and NVIDIA's new stuff that's coming out.
[439.58 --> 443.58]  780 Ti, which we get to talk about slightly, although we know nothing about it.
[443.58 --> 447.58]  So slightly is basically what I just said.
[447.58 --> 450.58]  It kind of exists and that's, yeah.
[450.58 --> 452.58]  So moving on from Riva Tuner.
[452.58 --> 455.58]  Blizzard All-Stars, now Heroes of the Storm.
[455.58 --> 462.58]  I love this topic because they basically said nothing in the biggest possible way.
[462.58 --> 464.58]  But it's kind of Blizzard style.
[464.58 --> 467.58]  It's really not something you should be confused about if you are used to them.
[467.58 --> 468.58]  Mm-hmm.
[468.58 --> 469.58]  You know, a little name change.
[469.58 --> 470.58]  That's all we're doing.
[470.58 --> 472.58]  You know, a little, they don't really rush anything.
[472.58 --> 474.58]  Um, but I'm extremely, extremely excited.
[474.58 --> 475.58]  I think it's going to be really cool.
[475.58 --> 478.58]  One thing that I liked actually is that the video for this, if you want to bring it up.
[478.58 --> 479.58]  Yep.
[479.58 --> 485.58]  Is, um, created by this, what is it, Carbot Animations.
[485.58 --> 490.58]  It's not even like a super crazy, they didn't spend tons of crazy amounts of money.
[490.58 --> 494.58]  They probably threw him something and it's just kind of awesome.
[494.58 --> 495.58]  Go to play the video for him.
[495.58 --> 499.58]  I'm going to make sure it's not way too astronomically loud for anybody.
[499.58 --> 502.58]  Oh, oh, there we go.
[502.58 --> 506.58]  Oh, oh, there we go.
[506.58 --> 507.58]  I mean!
[507.58 --> 523.58]  I'm kidding!
[523.58 --> 528.58]  You have to miss your consciences.
[528.58 --> 533.58]  Mm-hmm.
[533.58 --> 535.58]  Yes!
[535.58 --> 536.58]  Yes!
[536.58 --> 537.20]  Hmmm.
[538.04 --> 538.58]  Ha!
[539.96 --> 540.86]  UUR detal窓
[541.12 --> 541.78]  H 선생님
[545.44 --> 546.44]  He R U land
[548.56 --> 550.16]  Br seconds
[561.22 --> 563.84]  Apparently, the sound was way out of sync but you guys got the point.
[563.84 --> 568.00]  it's not exactly a super complicated video they just basically show some heroes and then heroes
[568.00 --> 573.30]  of the storm is now a thing so they're going to be showing that off at blizzcon yeah so this
[573.30 --> 577.06]  blizzcon is actually gonna be pretty intense yeah i would if if you could pick any blizzcon to go to
[577.06 --> 581.66]  this would be the one i i would love to go to blizzcon this year because you've got you've got
[581.66 --> 586.88]  hearthstone which is like gonna be huge i'm having tons of fun with hearthstone it's gonna be huge
[586.88 --> 590.66]  and it's one thing with hearthstone that's interesting is like okay there's magic which is
[590.66 --> 596.08]  massive but it has all the people that are already into card games i think hearthstone is
[596.08 --> 600.26]  going to bring people into card games that have never played card games before exactly and people
[600.26 --> 604.18]  from the warcraft universe such as such as us you know talk about vanilla wow we'll get into that a
[604.18 --> 609.50]  little bit yeah but guys like us who played a lot of warcraft you know warcraft i wish i played two
[609.50 --> 614.70]  yeah it's sad to say i only played three so warcraft three and and sunk a lot of time into world of
[614.70 --> 620.30]  warcraft especially vanilla wow burning crusade stuff like that um it really pulls us in and i
[620.30 --> 624.02]  remember we were talking you know the artwork is fantastic yeah as we're used to just being in
[624.02 --> 629.26]  the blizzard universe you're starting to read one of the novels i'm i'm three novels in right now
[629.26 --> 633.70]  uh landcouver an event we went to that actually gave away blizzard novels yeah so read the first
[633.70 --> 637.96]  free one ended up buying two more um going down to the states tomorrow to do some shopping i'll be
[637.96 --> 643.38]  buying at least three is my plan so you know the war the warcraft universe is really really cool
[643.38 --> 647.74]  really good lore and it's like you said it's pulling in the guys that have played card games before
[647.74 --> 651.52]  and the guys who haven't you know the guys who are used to magic and the guys who are used to
[651.52 --> 659.14]  uh warcraft and who are in the blizzard universe lots of money oh seriously and then like it pulls
[659.14 --> 663.88]  in the warcraft fans like us like we both really like the lore and we've played the games both
[663.88 --> 669.18]  versions kind of the game the rts and the mmo um and then you jump into the card game and you're
[669.18 --> 674.68]  like oh everything's familiar it's not scary i'm putting down raid leaders and murlocs like this is fine
[674.68 --> 679.20]  and then the people that are into card games the names of the cards aren't very important
[679.20 --> 685.40]  exactly not at all pre-knowing warcraft is not important at all so jumping into hearthstone is
[685.40 --> 691.96]  actually not difficult to do and quite easy it's it's i also find it much more uh noob friendly than
[691.96 --> 699.14]  something like uh magic because magic is really deep and really complicated and there's like so many
[699.14 --> 705.72]  ridiculous layers of strategy and of course there is with hearthstone still but the the um ease of
[705.72 --> 711.36]  entry and learning how to start i don't find to be that difficult yeah um so that's basically all we
[711.36 --> 717.90]  really have for blizzard all-stars is there's a name yeah hooray there's a name and something we
[717.90 --> 722.78]  mentioned it's the first time they've done anything except for starcraft warcraft or dablo
[722.78 --> 727.68]  yeah even though they're pulling off those the universe you know we mentioned like a mixture
[727.68 --> 732.80]  but it is a different game you have to understand this is one of the biggest companies to exist that
[732.80 --> 737.90]  has essentially three titles that have all existed for since the 90s well one thing one thing you could
[737.90 --> 744.00]  say that warcraft 3 was a rts and then they made an mmo which is that's true that's true that is true
[744.00 --> 748.38]  but then this one this is the first time they've had like uh universe crossovers as far as i know other
[748.38 --> 752.54]  than like joke stuff which they've definitely had but it was more on such a good point
[752.54 --> 756.34]  i've never even that's very obvious but i've never made the mental connection because because
[756.34 --> 761.16]  it happened so long ago yeah and it happened definitely an rts yeah and definitely went to
[761.16 --> 765.46]  an mmo there's no it was like the one of the biggest possible changes they could have done yeah
[765.46 --> 771.72]  but then like it happened so like what was it 2004 i want to say i think it was 2004 for vanilla
[771.72 --> 778.40]  wow 2006 for burning crusade or no no no no burning crusade was definitely later 2007 i want to say
[778.40 --> 784.34]  it was pre-2008 was it pre-2008 yeah because i know 2005 was the year i graduated and we were
[784.34 --> 788.20]  definitely playing warcraft then and when i went to school we were still playing warcraft and i was
[788.20 --> 795.56]  still rating mc and you know bwl and all that kind of stuff so yeah it must have been somewhere around
[795.56 --> 802.40]  2008 2000 maybe later 2007 i'm pretty sure about that i want to i just want to know just because i'm
[802.40 --> 807.00]  interested because it ties into a topic later on so the release date in north america for the actual
[807.00 --> 814.94]  full game was 2004 that makes a lot of sense and then burning crusade was oh snap burning crusade was
[814.94 --> 822.56]  january 2007 and wrath of lich came was november 2008 january 2007 yeah okay beginning of 2007 yeah
[822.56 --> 828.30]  okay that makes sense um so yeah it's actually quite old now you're looking at almost 10 years yeah
[828.30 --> 835.82]  because it's the recent 2004 it's 2013 now that's actually pretty ridiculous um i'm gonna jump one
[835.82 --> 839.78]  because i think that could be a lot no we'll actually do that right now um apple is pushing up
[839.78 --> 846.14]  resolutions so let's jump to bring that up on your screen i'll bring that up so apple is with their
[846.14 --> 852.18]  apple tv going to be pushing 4k soon and they're basically doing a resolution refresh or not necessarily
[852.18 --> 857.60]  refresh a they're pushing resolutions pretty hard on devices pretty much all across the board
[857.60 --> 863.00]  so this is pretty interesting it's from uh mac rumors i believe the person who posted on the forum
[863.00 --> 869.72]  was kirihuna i hope i'm saying that right uh that would be my guess yeah it's posted on mac rumors and
[869.72 --> 876.30]  honestly just like a lot of the like computer hardware sites if it's posted on mac rumors it's usually
[876.30 --> 881.74]  pretty correct or pretty close to correct so i wouldn't be surprised so you can see on there apple tv
[881.74 --> 889.24]  55 inch and 65 inch 4k that's beast that is i'm happy to see it and now a lot of people in the
[889.24 --> 895.42]  audience are i'm sure if i check twitch chat right now wherever it is um apple wow what the hell why
[895.42 --> 901.52]  is this apple um i'm not gonna buy one i'm not interested in buying one i'm not interested in
[901.52 --> 906.70]  buying one either but i already know what you're gonna say i'll i'll let you lead into it it's it's
[906.70 --> 911.34]  gonna push all the people who i'm gonna buy stuff from to make it better exactly which is the thing
[911.34 --> 915.66]  that i like about apple and which is why i like them hanging around is because the longer they're
[915.66 --> 922.18]  around the longer they push stuff the longer the stuff i get is not going to suck because we can
[922.18 --> 927.46]  look at samsung s3s and how much plastic is in this but i don't think something like the htc1
[927.46 --> 932.38]  would have ever come around if it wasn't for an iphone yeah absolutely yeah absolutely because we'd
[932.38 --> 937.36]  have more plasticky cheapy stuff which is good because we can afford it there's still the debate
[937.36 --> 942.64]  because we this is something we flexibility thing we agree on many many of things one thing we disagree
[942.64 --> 948.40]  on is this back yeah you just like it i like it i like the one of my main problems with this back
[948.40 --> 953.94]  is that there's not very many clips so it just like it comes off way too easy like i don't even have
[953.94 --> 965.90]  to try in the slightest one thing i noticed with some other phone that i don't have it's a little
[965.90 --> 974.76]  bit is maybe it it's maybe more difficult in theory it could be possibly more difficult to take off
[974.76 --> 984.94]  if you were to do that if that was a thing if you have done that that may um apple anyways it's i
[984.94 --> 988.88]  think it's good what they're doing but just to get i'm gonna i'm gonna no can't reach it too far
[988.88 --> 993.56]  the thing is when i bought my s3 i have an otterbox case on it not the crazy one i don't even remember
[993.56 --> 1000.14]  the name but i can't use my phone without that otterbox case on you know so the back to me that's
[1000.14 --> 1005.38]  just where we differ you like to have no case with my day job i gotta have a case on that thing
[1005.38 --> 1009.82]  yeah i used to carry a case it's just a different when i went to school and stuff i had a case if
[1009.82 --> 1014.90]  you're gonna go no case i personally think the htc1 is could be just a better way to go although
[1014.90 --> 1018.84]  you lose the functionality of changing out the battery and the sd cards like i love the fact that
[1018.84 --> 1023.34]  with samsung phones you can just take that off i have an extra battery in my backpack at all times
[1023.34 --> 1031.38]  i tried that's another thing i tried to um swap the battery on this phone i don't know if you
[1031.38 --> 1034.90]  remember that i tried to swap the battery because i thought that was the problem with my phone having
[1034.90 --> 1041.14]  so many battery problems and then uh that didn't help then i went on cyanogen mod and that helped
[1041.14 --> 1045.72]  best thing ever so because even though you can't change the battery you can still go cyanogen mod on
[1045.72 --> 1052.46]  htc1 that's true so i would almost see that would be a like bigger improvement actually um just one
[1052.46 --> 1060.32]  second this actually go live yes it did um yeah where's timmy is he supposed to be calling us or
[1060.32 --> 1065.72]  uh i thought you said five o'clock right i believe you said five originally yeah i thought he was just
[1065.72 --> 1070.90]  gonna hang out in the channel i was hoping so he's he's he's been too many ways there's the shout out
[1070.90 --> 1076.64]  for timmy so he's hopefully coming back but we are going to jump on to the next topic for now
[1076.64 --> 1082.32]  secure u.s government numbers leaked on 4chan it's like the scariest title
[1082.32 --> 1089.10]  i've read in so long 4chan will never quit it's it's yeah it's just yeah so this is from anime
[1089.10 --> 1097.06]  wolf kid um and the article is found on daily caller something do do do do yeah daily caller.com
[1097.06 --> 1103.14]  and basically numbers were leaked like a while ago and then leaked again recently and the numbers
[1103.14 --> 1108.14]  include this is a long list so give me a second the white house situation room the direct line to
[1108.14 --> 1113.04]  the u.s department of state operations center senior watch officer that's the longest thing ever
[1113.04 --> 1119.18]  um the national military command center at the pentagon the u.s strategic command bunker the
[1119.18 --> 1125.38]  campisi alert facility the operations room for the national airborne operations center the raven rock
[1125.38 --> 1133.68]  mountain complex the active control room of the 91st operations group the 740th missile squadron
[1133.68 --> 1141.94]  and the kirtland underground munition storage complex that's a lot of things so the numbers were
[1141.94 --> 1148.64]  originally posted on september 13th and they reposted on october the 13th and basically it's ridiculous
[1148.64 --> 1155.74]  it's 4chan so what they did is they called in and they asked about battletoads because it's 4chan
[1155.74 --> 1162.90]  what do you want them to do so so expect really yeah i was actually kind of this is going to sound
[1162.90 --> 1168.48]  bad you shouldn't call the pentagon but when but when i read this and i was like they asked for
[1168.48 --> 1173.78]  battletoads i was kind of happy because i was like the internet's never really gonna change we're always
[1173.78 --> 1178.18]  going to want more battletoads yeah we're always going to ask for more battle battle toads will always
[1178.18 --> 1182.84]  be in demand they will be this is something we know yeah one of my comments here is i love how people
[1182.84 --> 1186.50]  received information like this and their knee-jerk reaction was to ask about battletoads
[1186.50 --> 1191.12]  because that's like like the first thing they do after they get it is oh do you have battletoads it's
[1191.12 --> 1196.32]  like what there's no way um anyways that was pretty awesome if you guys want to hear i think there's
[1196.32 --> 1201.28]  three of the recordings were posted online on giazo or whatever so if you want to hear those if you
[1201.28 --> 1205.06]  check out the wanshow document which will be in the description of this video after it is uploaded
[1205.06 --> 1209.78]  as an archive on youtube you can check that out and in there there's the three links to hear the
[1209.78 --> 1215.44]  recordings uh two of them don't have the other line recorded so they're kind of boring and that
[1215.44 --> 1220.38]  dude just asked about uh battletoads the third guy has the other line recorded but all you can hear
[1220.38 --> 1226.68]  from him is uh he's a little bit hard to understand i and he has a pretty heavy accent and then he says
[1226.68 --> 1232.86]  like a whole bunch of code words so it sounds super serious and then just hangs up um is timmy in the
[1232.86 --> 1242.18]  team speak now timmy is in the team speak there we go hello timmy hello timmy
[1242.18 --> 1251.12]  hey how's it going there we go we can hear do you have your headphones i do one second timmy
[1251.12 --> 1259.80]  i am here sorry guys i should have had this ready oh it's all good um do do do do do
[1259.80 --> 1268.38]  all right timmy do you want to introduce yourself tell people where they can find you tell them who
[1268.38 --> 1275.90]  you are what you do what's a youtube blah blah blah so i'm just a small youtube channel um this is a
[1275.90 --> 1282.36]  hobby it's timmy tech tv up on youtube so it's you forward slash timmy tech tv um and mainly i'm trying
[1282.36 --> 1292.46]  to do unboxings of stuff and more from a user perspective you know rather than i don't know i
[1292.46 --> 1297.80]  guess the polish that you guys put on stuff i just kind of do it as a hobby and it's mostly stuff that
[1297.80 --> 1305.40]  i buy or that you know i build for people as a system builder so that's cool um sorry we're fooling
[1305.40 --> 1311.16]  around there a little bit uh all right so we're going to jump into our first topic
[1311.16 --> 1319.10]  do do do do which timmy chose and that is the r9 290x launch has been postponed now i found this
[1319.10 --> 1323.20]  pretty interesting because one of timmy's tweets actually made it into the article so make sure you
[1323.20 --> 1328.16]  bring up both there we're going to jump to the laptop screen and basically as you can see right
[1328.16 --> 1332.42]  there timmy's tweet down there at the bottom um it's been delayed a whole bunch what do you have
[1332.42 --> 1338.14]  to say about this uh first i'm famous and i didn't even know it until i saw the link you posted there
[1338.14 --> 1347.14]  but um the i think this is a game of of one upsmanship i think um that maybe amd found out
[1347.14 --> 1354.56]  that nvidia was hosting that event this weekend and decided to hold off um you know this is a lot of
[1354.56 --> 1360.12]  leaks have come out about you know how it compares to the the 780 when it's in quiet mode
[1360.12 --> 1366.62]  right i'm curious i'm just kind of curious if they're going to want everybody to rerun
[1366.62 --> 1374.38]  against the 780 ti before they release the embargo that's not a bad point because it's been really
[1374.38 --> 1379.34]  confusing from the reviewer's end because like we get this card and they're like yeah here's your
[1379.34 --> 1385.44]  release date and then right before the release date it's like nope nope don't do it this is your
[1385.44 --> 1389.40]  new release nope this is your new nope this is your new release date it's like what are you doing
[1389.40 --> 1395.50]  stop um yeah well and i thought i thought it was really interesting that they actually let the one
[1395.50 --> 1403.70]  stat come out but nothing else yeah the one stat going out nothing else and then they're gonna have a
[1403.70 --> 1407.98]  not necessarily hands-on as in i don't know if people can use it but they have that event coming up
[1407.98 --> 1415.82]  the public event right by the nvidia event that's going on right now like that's ballsy i yeah i
[1415.82 --> 1420.66]  thought that was actually really awesome to be honest with you because usually it's video trolling
[1420.66 --> 1427.20]  amd yeah so i thought the uh hey we're just gonna set up it across the street from you and show you how
[1427.20 --> 1431.86]  awesome ac4 looks and 4k you know surround
[1431.86 --> 1438.00]  yeah it's kind of cool i thought that was pretty crazy and then they had 780s there too
[1438.00 --> 1444.12]  so you could see the 290x and then you could see a 780 playing the same game so like that was
[1444.12 --> 1448.26]  really aggressive in my opinion because they they could have gone with just their card and been like
[1448.26 --> 1454.18]  look how well it works but no right beside the nvidia event that is press only they had an open to
[1454.18 --> 1459.04]  the public event where you could see both cards so like they're doing this stuff behind doors we'll do
[1459.04 --> 1463.10]  it right here i think it's what timmy said they're just one upping each other yeah you know to make
[1463.10 --> 1467.12]  another starcraft analogy because that's all i seem to do you know they they're seeing their
[1467.12 --> 1470.52]  opponent take a third base well i'll take a fourth i'll take you know i'll take a fifth i'll take more
[1470.52 --> 1474.96]  i'll do this you know i'm gonna sit back a little bit i'm gonna grow stronger and stronger and stronger
[1474.96 --> 1479.06]  before we end up you know really getting into it and really start swinging at each other
[1479.06 --> 1484.06]  but what a cool idea out to the public here's theirs here's ours and it's interesting
[1484.06 --> 1491.24]  no go i was gonna say to be fair that from what i heard from people is that there was somebody at
[1491.24 --> 1496.84]  the door asking people if they were media and then gently reminding them that nvidia did invite them
[1496.84 --> 1502.84]  and they shouldn't come in so they weren't like hey all you media guys come on over and you know
[1502.84 --> 1508.92]  check this out that's interesting that's kind of cool yeah some respect there for sure that is
[1508.92 --> 1514.50]  actually pretty cool to be honest um it's yeah the whole one-upping thing i was actually pretty
[1514.50 --> 1519.78]  surprised at the 780 ti announcement yeah no kidding when people were talking about rumors going
[1519.78 --> 1525.76]  on that were about stuff that was going to come out of this nvidia event i expected uh other ti series
[1525.76 --> 1530.48]  for the 700 series to be announced the 780 ti i wasn't sure if they had it sitting there or not
[1530.48 --> 1537.06]  because the 780 and titan are actually pretty close to be completely honest and the 780 ti segment
[1537.06 --> 1542.54]  might make a lot of sense especially if they do a price drop on 780 so they're uh more competitive
[1542.54 --> 1546.16]  or whatever so it's gonna be interesting what's happening now because nvidia basically is sitting
[1546.16 --> 1552.28]  there with this card that as far as i know no one has yet going you don't know what this is yeah you're
[1552.28 --> 1556.74]  about to release your new big card what if this crushes you yeah and it puts amd in a pretty awkward
[1556.74 --> 1563.12]  spot but then amd responds by going here everybody try it whatever so it's gonna be really interesting
[1563.12 --> 1568.52]  the gpu wars were kind of dead there for a little while if people watched our streams from back when
[1568.52 --> 1573.60]  we were in the garage you could probably see the it was just dominated the dim and grim let's be honest
[1573.60 --> 1579.04]  yeah yeah we were we were pretty much just talking about like will amd still be a company next well
[1579.04 --> 1582.94]  last time we were on the show we were saying you know amds you know they're really picking up some
[1582.94 --> 1587.84]  some speed i remember talking about that they're really coming together and and in the few weeks it
[1587.84 --> 1593.06]  hasn't even been that long you've seen incredible developments and what we both said was you know we
[1593.06 --> 1598.76]  feel like nvidia is really the big guys and just like we're talking about with apple you know we
[1598.76 --> 1605.10]  want them to push the industry amd is now absolutely pushing the industry whether if you're a fan of amd
[1605.10 --> 1610.66]  obviously that's great if you're not a fan of amd that's also great that's great yeah this is a win-win
[1610.66 --> 1616.58]  for consumers yep because stuff like 780ti will actually become a thing now exactly what are you
[1616.58 --> 1622.32]  you know and the other thing is there's a lot of you know any reviewer gets accused of this oh
[1622.32 --> 1628.24]  you're a you know nvidia fanboy oh you're an amd fanboy in my personal systems i tend to use more
[1628.24 --> 1634.62]  nvidia parts but for friends and family i tend to recommend more amd parts and for everybody in
[1634.62 --> 1640.76]  general you know people need to realize a strong amd makes nvidia better and a strong amd makes intel
[1640.76 --> 1645.12]  better because they can't sit on their hands and not give us the products that they've been
[1645.12 --> 1649.48]  developing for the last five years absolutely it's a super good point so if they do better on
[1649.48 --> 1653.52]  the gpu side that will hopefully just have more money flowing through the company in general
[1653.52 --> 1659.72]  and will help the cpu side too so this is actually just generally just it's all wins for us yeah it's
[1659.72 --> 1665.28]  literally good what's going on yeah for the consumers and especially who knows if that 780ti was meant
[1665.28 --> 1670.78]  to be an 800 series card and they pulled it back a generation just to compete exactly whether it was
[1670.78 --> 1674.84]  like an 870 or that is not something i would have thought of that's really interesting it's they do
[1674.84 --> 1679.46]  that a lot though they'll take a make a slightly higher tier card and they'll drop it down one tier
[1679.46 --> 1683.64]  and then just release it in the next series so that's actually a really good point it could have been
[1683.64 --> 1689.46]  what we were looking at for the 870 or something like that but we have no idea um more at the nvidia
[1689.46 --> 1697.20]  event uh nvidia g-sync s-y-n-c this is pretty crazy when i first read the article about it on
[1697.20 --> 1705.26]  um video cards.com if you can jump that right so nope up it's in the guest topics
[1705.26 --> 1714.08]  right there um so when i first read this i was like oh that's pretty cool but no one's gonna care
[1714.08 --> 1719.32]  because you're locked down to nvidia setup and like who knows what's actually gonna work where
[1719.32 --> 1723.16]  and it's so proprietary it's locked down blah blah blah and those were all the immediate thoughts
[1723.16 --> 1728.14]  that came to my mind um and whatever improvements it could be and i read about how it's it's syncing
[1728.14 --> 1732.24]  the refresh rate with how your graphics card is performing at the time and it's supposed to make
[1732.24 --> 1735.74]  it smoother and stuff and i was like ah it's basically making the refresh rate dynamic would
[1735.74 --> 1741.52]  that be a good way to yeah yeah um but i was wondering like i was just saying like how much is
[1741.52 --> 1746.36]  that really gonna do yeah like is that really gonna help it that much and how much is it gonna cost in
[1746.36 --> 1749.26]  the end then how much is it gonna cost you because you got to invest in this new monitor
[1749.26 --> 1754.02]  because it's not gonna it's it's built into the monitor and by in the end i mean you know when you
[1754.02 --> 1758.92]  eventually take that like we do you know when that system becomes you know split up into two other
[1758.92 --> 1765.32]  systems or whatever happens how is that going to work yeah yeah so i was i was pretty drawn back about
[1765.32 --> 1769.42]  this and then i got a call from linus those of you that were watching the pre-show know that that
[1769.42 --> 1774.82]  happened and i was kind of wondering what he was on about um it was g-sync and he has used it and in
[1774.82 --> 1782.32]  his words he is where is it he is completely mind blown and he gushed pretty hardcore while he's on
[1782.32 --> 1788.80]  the phone and his comparative was you go watch a movie and it looks really really good but it's at a
[1788.80 --> 1792.48]  much lower frame rate than what you're used to it's at less than half usually because it's usually
[1792.48 --> 1799.04]  running about 24 fps and we're gonna just consider that everyone's running at 60 fps in games all the
[1799.04 --> 1804.12]  time which is really not something we could do but whatever everyone's running at 60 fps all the time
[1804.12 --> 1811.34]  um this is supposed to make it seem more like a movie it's supposed to be way more smooth because
[1811.34 --> 1817.62]  the refresh rate of your monitor will adaptively change to your gpu so there won't be as much
[1817.62 --> 1822.72]  tearing there won't be as much chopping it'll be much smoother no matter what happens and coming from
[1822.72 --> 1827.18]  linus's mouth saying he's completely mind blown is a really big deal i can't really say much else
[1827.18 --> 1832.24]  other than linus said he was completely mind blown because i haven't seen it you had it on speakerphone yeah
[1832.24 --> 1838.00]  he was extremely excited that's i just want to emphasize that he was very excited sounded very
[1838.00 --> 1842.72]  genuinely impressed he was not on a stream you know he didn't have that energy of trying to be on
[1842.72 --> 1848.22]  camera he was just talking to you on the phone and was was was very excited it's it's it's probably the
[1848.22 --> 1852.88]  most mind blown i've ever heard him what are you gonna say to me i caught a little of the stream this
[1852.88 --> 1858.96]  morning and especially the after kind of the after event where they had the panel but right before that
[1858.96 --> 1865.46]  he walked over to tim and tim was just had walked over to one of those uh g-sync uh computer systems
[1865.46 --> 1870.88]  and you could see him like messing around you know like he made it the absolute worst case it could be
[1870.88 --> 1876.54]  yeah and you could once in a while see a little tiny and that's real time you know rendering on that
[1876.54 --> 1882.52]  display yeah you every once in a while you could see a little a little tiny jitter where it you could
[1882.52 --> 1887.02]  tell that the frame rate was dropping a little bit but it wasn't going all the way down but you could
[1887.02 --> 1895.74]  always read the text that was on the pendulum and it there was never any tearing if you really paid
[1895.74 --> 1900.96]  attention you could see it down shifting in frames but right never saw tearing you never saw artifacts
[1900.96 --> 1906.22]  so i can see why he's excited about it i think the same thing that you guys already said which is
[1906.22 --> 1912.96]  you know i'm scared that this is another one of those proprietary you know products where you know i
[1912.96 --> 1919.30]  have a 30 inch ips panel yeah do i want to pay you know a thousand dollars for another 30 inch ips panel
[1919.30 --> 1926.52]  just so that i can use this um so that's kind of scary but if they can talk you know tv manufacturers
[1926.52 --> 1934.18]  into shipping with that part it's a huge win and there was something in the stream and i may have
[1934.18 --> 1939.42]  misheard them but they seem to allude to it was a product that they were going to license
[1939.42 --> 1947.56]  as well so i don't know if that means that you know what that means but oh are you saying as in
[1947.56 --> 1955.68]  that amd could utilize it uh because i wouldn't go that far but they seem to allude to that it was
[1955.68 --> 1961.06]  like because physics there are some things that the the two companies do where they do share the
[1961.06 --> 1966.28]  technology because it's better for you know all of pc sales right even though they don't really want
[1966.28 --> 1971.40]  you to know that they do every once in a while work together for the betterment of everybody you
[1971.40 --> 1978.40]  know all the users yeah but it'd be interesting to see if that's the tact you know who knows you know
[1978.40 --> 1983.98]  two three years down the road if you know if nvidia adopts something like mantle or two three years down
[1983.98 --> 1988.68]  the road that amd adopts something like g-sync it's it's going to be pretty interesting one thing
[1988.68 --> 1996.52]  to note with this too is um as a complete i have two uh pa248 qs big ips panels and i know you just
[1996.52 --> 2003.32]  said you had a 30 inch ips panel this will only be working on tn yeah that was the other thing yeah
[2003.32 --> 2010.10]  so so while i'm excited about it and all the guys that have those like super quick benq monitors that
[2010.10 --> 2013.82]  they're using the light boost trick and all that kind of stuff on i think those guys would be really
[2013.82 --> 2022.22]  interested in that but um ips lovers i don't know i'm still not completely sold because if i have to
[2022.22 --> 2029.02]  go buy a tn panel i'm just going to look at it and be sad all the time to be like why does this exist
[2029.02 --> 2036.18]  i really felt like when i saw this it was like wow that's an awesome technology and there's like a
[2036.18 --> 2043.60]  50 chance it's doa yeah yeah there's a pretty big chance who's going to use it other than you know
[2043.60 --> 2049.42]  high-end gamers you know we'll see what else they can do with it you know if they can work
[2049.42 --> 2056.38]  you know because tvs they they may put this in tvs at some point right and if if that is part of
[2056.38 --> 2062.34]  you know like the whole streaming experience right so now you could stream to your tv and not just your
[2062.34 --> 2068.60]  shield then it makes a lot of sense but i think they're just going into the tn panels honestly to
[2068.60 --> 2073.28]  start there and get a footprint and then i think you're going to see it yeah i think you're going
[2073.28 --> 2077.60]  to see it distributed more widely at some point but i'm wondering if there's some type of technical
[2077.60 --> 2082.54]  limitation because there's actually quite a big difference between tn and ips panels um less of
[2082.54 --> 2089.56]  which between ips and pls in my mind just how it kind of works um because they are a lot faster
[2089.56 --> 2093.20]  so i wonder if that's part of has something to do with the refresh rate switching
[2093.20 --> 2097.92]  but maybe that's something they can fix in the end they did say that they've been working on this
[2097.92 --> 2104.24]  for about five years yeah yeah so that's that's actually quite interesting it'll it'll be really
[2104.24 --> 2108.10]  interesting to see what's going on with g-sync hopefully we get a sample here so we can try it
[2108.10 --> 2113.98]  out and do some videos on it because with our slow-mo camera we could show comparisons between a g-sync
[2113.98 --> 2119.28]  monitor and a non-g-sync monitor in the same situations yeah hopefully i know there's a few games
[2119.28 --> 2124.38]  actually that i can make tear because i know certain parts that are hard for it so if i jump
[2124.38 --> 2128.60]  and turn in the right motion i'll see it tear like crazy so i'll try and show g-sync comparative
[2128.60 --> 2133.90]  against that and then oh yeah just hopefully we get one so we can show it off because that would be
[2133.90 --> 2140.58]  really cool um what happened my power cable for my laptop there it is sorry we're probably going to
[2140.58 --> 2145.30]  jump into more topics than what's just in the guest topic list but now we should jump up to
[2145.30 --> 2152.26]  blizzard free at last so this is really interesting so i think it was a joint venture between the
[2152.26 --> 2159.04]  company and the ceo and one other guy which is kind of interesting because the ceo and another dude
[2159.04 --> 2165.30]  paid in a whole bunch into this but basically put by put up on the forum by each on though
[2165.30 --> 2172.86]  we're going to jump onto that screen now um blizzard is no longer under vivendi
[2172.86 --> 2177.96]  and this is really interesting because one thing that richard was actually talking about earlier
[2177.96 --> 2184.10]  is we were huge fans of vanilla wow and burning crusade and cod for which were all created before
[2184.10 --> 2191.14]  vivendi owned blizzards okay are you ready i'm ready go for gold those were the best games that were
[2191.14 --> 2198.34]  vanilla wow it's so much better than any other wild expansions that came out items sets should not be
[2198.34 --> 2205.24]  four pieces i wear four pieces of clothing that are not a set i go together sets should be eight pieces
[2205.24 --> 2211.96]  tier 0.5 is amazing tier 0.5 is what you get from going into five mans and some pieces you need
[2211.96 --> 2217.78]  from a 10 man dungeon that was called ubers you got a tier 0.5 and why you did that is because you
[2217.78 --> 2224.20]  went and got your tier 0.5 so that you could say to this guild that goes hardcore that does work in
[2224.20 --> 2229.00]  40 man raid and says you know what i'm a decent candidate for your guild because i have gathered
[2229.00 --> 2235.28]  my tier 0.5 gear i know what i'm doing and i'm getting myself into it it's not all purple because
[2235.28 --> 2241.00]  purple is supposed to be rare and things that are rare means not everyone has them i know video games
[2241.00 --> 2247.78]  are trying to teach kids differently these days but rare means scarce not extraordinarily common
[2247.78 --> 2253.40]  which games are games are kind of sorry timmy i'm kind of going on a bit of a rant here but vanilla
[2253.40 --> 2260.30]  and 40 man raids the way that loot was done the difficulty was insane people used to go against mc for
[2260.30 --> 2266.94]  weeks before you know you could finish molten core and bwl oh my goodness you know the dragons in there
[2266.94 --> 2271.54]  the coordination of the very i'm i'm i'm embarrassing myself because i don't remember the very first
[2271.54 --> 2277.72]  dragon but the coordination of the fight the hunters literally running around the outside pulling dragons
[2277.72 --> 2282.62]  with them ads and everyone was in different locations the difficulty the very first boss the
[2282.62 --> 2287.80]  very first you just walk in the door and they're like here you go maybe in a month maybe in a month
[2287.80 --> 2292.50]  we'll practice enough to get this done because you cannot just walk through the door press three
[2292.50 --> 2297.70]  macros be on your second monitor watching youtube and still win it doesn't work like that anymore
[2297.70 --> 2304.62]  cod 4 is the best call of duty ever made i think some people will debate you about cod 2 versus that
[2304.62 --> 2309.36]  but that would be a good argument that would be an argument in which i would disagree but respect
[2309.36 --> 2317.32]  the other side if you argue black ops or something like that this is the thing in one thing from my
[2317.32 --> 2322.14]  casting i'm getting a little more energetic now but in my casting i do take punctual opinions
[2322.14 --> 2325.54]  something i've a little stayed a little bit away from in my last time but on this one i definitely
[2325.54 --> 2332.82]  will cod 4 was the last time call of duty has also had dedicated servers now i hope everyone in the pc
[2332.82 --> 2337.44]  world am i right about that i think they're no i don't necessarily modern warfare 2 did not
[2337.44 --> 2341.72]  um but they might have gone back to that now that i'm thinking about it they might have gone back to
[2341.72 --> 2346.86]  it i think there's been a one at least i think there's been at least one since cod 4 the twitch chat will
[2346.86 --> 2352.16]  tell me we're waiting on the twitch we'll have to see um og black ops did yeah i remember yeah i
[2352.16 --> 2359.18]  was gonna say yeah black ops 2 sorry my my problem is i fell off the bones and i did not yeah but they
[2359.18 --> 2365.64]  was they changed it over from from dedicated servers to modern warfare 2 had the same matchmaking xbox
[2365.64 --> 2374.82]  terrible that was feels bad can't customize the game has bad hosting has a so many more limits um i know
[2374.82 --> 2378.38]  we used to play on one server in cod 4 specifically where you could take a helicopter down with a
[2378.38 --> 2382.96]  single bullet yeah because they just didn't want the helicopter in the game which if you feel like
[2382.96 --> 2386.38]  playing with no helicopters jump on their server you feel like playing a different way jump on their
[2386.38 --> 2391.76]  server and it was just it was excellent i apologize i did by the time black ops came around i'm i'm just
[2391.76 --> 2395.70]  off the boat yeah so someone said uh i never actually played modern warfare 3 but apparently
[2395.70 --> 2399.88]  modern warfare 3 also had unranked servers but it's like i don't know the server support and the
[2399.88 --> 2405.28]  customizability was also at a different level i think i also liked how i don't really it was it
[2405.28 --> 2410.82]  was more simple it was more of a counter-strike idea um in the in the manner that not everything
[2410.82 --> 2418.60]  exploded and not everything was fireworks and flying this blowing up that dogs and there's just um i
[2418.60 --> 2426.04]  remember when i was learning website design i want to say in like 2000 everything was like two flashy
[2426.04 --> 2431.58]  and blah but we were told not to hollywood in class she made our teacher our tech teacher made a
[2431.58 --> 2438.34]  very specific point of saying do not flashy everywhere or you will lose marks and you know keep it keep
[2438.34 --> 2444.18]  it simple and simplistic and that's something that cod 4 did i think the best uh just an unbelievable
[2444.18 --> 2450.62]  very meticulous uh very good gameplay but i'm gonna breathe for a second i'm gonna let timmy talk
[2450.62 --> 2458.72]  i'm uh i'm uh so i like call of duty 4 but 2 was my favorite you play 2 and veteran was awesome
[2458.72 --> 2465.18]  where it's a one where it was a one shot and if you could get through that that campaign mode in
[2465.18 --> 2473.16]  veteran you were the boss because there were some parts where the nazis were just cool uh the trench
[2473.16 --> 2478.76]  warfare in that game is like i went to bed at night like having nightmares about you know being in world
[2478.76 --> 2485.86]  war 2 but the uh i so i was i had to mute myself because i was laughing about the wow stuff so i
[2485.86 --> 2492.78]  was a day one wow guy um you know 40 man raids um you know doing the five mans where it's like
[2492.78 --> 2498.52]  oh i have three of the four pieces can i please join your guild yeah they're like nope nope you have to go
[2498.52 --> 2503.54]  get the pants right you know yeah yeah but you know i was a warrior back in those days and you know
[2503.54 --> 2508.74]  that was when it was hard mode man that was there was no joking around like you didn't just play for
[2508.74 --> 2514.92]  a little while i'm like oh look i have bull it was like oh my god a blue yeah yeah yeah get it
[2514.92 --> 2518.84]  get it i remember when the first dude in our guild got full epics everyone just kind of like stood
[2518.84 --> 2524.20]  around and was like well the tank from flying hellfish the top rank gill on kiljaden which one
[2524.20 --> 2529.94]  was was which was one and i still probably is i think it is one of the best north american servers
[2529.94 --> 2536.58]  he would i forget his name oh regardless he would sit in the bank in orgrimmar when there was one
[2536.58 --> 2541.82]  bank and not two cities in one city um he would sit on the bank and people would just surround him
[2541.82 --> 2547.06]  because he had all the rare items which were actually rare yeah and he was he was the main
[2547.06 --> 2553.26]  tank and the guild leader of the top ranked guild and it showed which was awesome oh i know his name
[2553.26 --> 2558.94]  i don't know what it was it was back back in the days when it was uh you know might was the big you
[2558.94 --> 2566.26]  know the tier one set yeah then you we always called it the um when you started to get the tier two set
[2566.26 --> 2572.30]  the wrath set you get all the warriors had the little you know crescent helmet which was hysterical but
[2572.30 --> 2580.68]  yeah i think so back on topic away from wow i guess yes yes good idea i'm really excited about the fact
[2580.68 --> 2586.88]  that they see what's happening the corruption that's happening to their company because
[2586.88 --> 2593.46]  when you know this is like bungie is no longer a part of microsoft right yeah this is what happens
[2593.46 --> 2601.14]  when you have a game studio above you that their only goal is to make money off of you right so you saw
[2601.14 --> 2607.00]  before where you know it may have taken blizzard 10 years to release something like they were working
[2607.00 --> 2613.94]  on world of warcraft for as long as i can remember yep so it i feel like even though they took forever
[2613.94 --> 2625.36]  on like um uh diablo 3 that they would have never in that like micro uh transaction system if it had been
[2625.36 --> 2632.46]  just blizzard yeah right that to me the whole auction house you could use real money to buy things
[2632.46 --> 2636.72]  in the game was the most ridiculous thing i'd ever seen because i played that game for like 10 minutes it
[2636.72 --> 2643.26]  was like i'm done i can if i can buy it with real money it's not a real game yeah yeah that drives me
[2643.26 --> 2649.40]  crazy as well um but i still i still remember the heyday of you know like when the original starcraft
[2649.40 --> 2654.76]  came out like i still love that game i still go back and play that game it's like the graphics are
[2654.76 --> 2661.02]  horrible now but the gameplay is just you know wicked yeah it's i actually the first time i ever saw
[2661.02 --> 2666.32]  starcraft before broodware come out was at a buddy's house you know kind of the old story of you know he had a
[2666.32 --> 2670.42]  computer and uh i think we had a computer back then but it wasn't very strong he had a new one
[2670.42 --> 2674.64]  and uh he went and bought it from costco or something like that his mom bought it but uh
[2674.64 --> 2679.24]  and we just played through the single player and we took turns playing it and i'm actually still
[2679.24 --> 2685.56]  friends with him um he is a volunteer firefighter at the same hall i'm at so it's kind of kind of cool
[2685.56 --> 2691.34]  um yeah but that that's where my first starcraft experience uh that came from we are gonna work on
[2691.34 --> 2697.02]  the leg here guys i'm trying to figure it out keep going keep going um but oh and one of the big
[2697.02 --> 2702.88]  things to me i i glad you kind of sounds like you came from the same roots in these games that uh slick
[2702.88 --> 2706.36]  and i did and one thing that's really exciting was seeing blizzard on its own as you were saying
[2706.36 --> 2712.80]  they can make their own choices um is with both of their new games coming out it's it's huge now that
[2712.80 --> 2717.28]  they own themselves and they're going on this on this new path with new games i just kind of want
[2717.28 --> 2722.76]  to find out what you think about that yeah i just think it's you know it's nice to see them go back
[2722.76 --> 2729.62]  to i guess what i felt like made them a successful company and you know they're they're the classic
[2729.62 --> 2735.30]  story of like hey there's a blizzard game coming out and everybody's really really really really
[2735.30 --> 2741.60]  excited for it and they released like you know some 30 second rendered video and and then five years
[2741.60 --> 2747.40]  later the game comes out yeah right yeah but we always used you know you'd be like oh blizzard
[2747.40 --> 2752.90]  and then when that game came out one the waiting made it even better but two you knew it was going
[2752.90 --> 2758.56]  to be good exactly you know even wow with all the technical difficulties they had in like the very early
[2758.56 --> 2763.38]  days you know and even with the you know some of the bugs that were in there it was still
[2763.38 --> 2769.62]  like mind-blowingly better than anything that had come out before absolutely and i think they'll be
[2769.62 --> 2774.30]  able to go back to that you know if it's the right thing to delay a shipment by six months so that
[2774.30 --> 2778.64]  they can finish something that they really want in the game now they'll be able to do that again
[2778.64 --> 2785.62]  exactly and here's an interesting thing uh there's they're going to make a warcraft movie um not sure
[2785.62 --> 2789.88]  if you're aware of that and i i work in the film industry here in vancouver vancouver is signed up
[2789.88 --> 2793.96]  vancouver is going to be making well not vancouver is going to be making but they're going to be making
[2793.96 --> 2798.86]  the warcraft movie in vancouver um everyone i work with is very excited to be completely honest
[2798.86 --> 2803.80]  not many of them play games the reason they're excited is there's a ton of movies being made in
[2803.80 --> 2809.94]  vancouver i work i took the day off to do this stream i work a ton um and it's they are projecting
[2809.94 --> 2817.42]  that is going to absolutely without a doubt be by significant margin the highest budgeted movie ever
[2817.42 --> 2823.36]  created in canada um which is which is pretty big uh they call vancouver holly or california north
[2823.36 --> 2828.64]  yeah um i think we are maybe we're third now but i believe we're second north america
[2828.64 --> 2833.20]  uh for producing movies and tv shows so everyone's really excited about that because the budget is
[2833.20 --> 2836.96]  going to be huge and one thing that i was explaining to them is if it is blizzard running
[2836.96 --> 2840.80]  it i'm not exactly sure maybe they i hope they didn't sell the rights or something like that but
[2840.80 --> 2845.62]  if it is blizzard controlling it they will delay this movie until they have decided it is
[2845.62 --> 2850.32]  perfection which you know what if it takes years i'm okay with that because like you said
[2850.32 --> 2856.02]  it will be amazing and it will be worth it yep i think we should probably stop talking about wow now
[2856.02 --> 2862.08]  because i think we've been talking about wow for 15 minutes uh yeah the chat has renamed this the wow
[2862.08 --> 2868.76]  show we've yeah i think they've been renaming it the wow show for a little while um i think one of the
[2868.76 --> 2874.96]  editors at the lioness media group head office is uploading videos right now which is i think maybe why
[2874.96 --> 2879.42]  we're lagging for the people that are saying we're lagging i'm trying to get in contact with him
[2879.42 --> 2885.68]  without screaming because that would come through the mic terribly um but i've messaged him he has not
[2885.68 --> 2890.98]  messaged back hopefully he responds because i'm pretty sure he's uploading videos that he has finished
[2890.98 --> 2898.82]  rendering and i'm pretty sure that's why we are continually dropping frames so we are lagging um but
[2898.82 --> 2908.18]  yeah i can't kick him off unfortunately maybe call him call it's i just it's not multiple reasons that i
[2908.18 --> 2914.10]  can't do it though oh because i don't have my work account linked into this phone yet so i don't have
[2914.10 --> 2919.04]  his phone number blah blah blah blah i could mute the mic not really actually because of how the new
[2919.04 --> 2926.52]  audio set of oh yes i can no i can't why is that unplug the snowball but that could be creative it's not
[2926.52 --> 2933.50]  the snowball it's that mic that's oh that's right that's right um but yeah hopefully it stops hopefully
[2933.50 --> 2938.22]  the video is no it's we're definitely lagging we're dropped we're legitimately dropping frames so
[2938.22 --> 2943.80]  there's frames that the video is recording that are not making it to you guys so while it might not be
[2943.80 --> 2948.60]  too bad for certain people that probably have better connections um it's definitely dropping frames
[2948.60 --> 2954.82]  um i can mute this is for someone who just said your audio setup is retarded if you can't mute
[2954.82 --> 2960.12]  i agree i can't mute because of the mixers on the other side and i can't press the thing and the
[2960.12 --> 2964.64]  reason why it's over there is because the power cord for the mixer is so ridiculously terrible and low
[2964.64 --> 2971.82]  quality anyways we're gonna move forward if i can find this one um back on the amd graphics that
[2971.82 --> 2977.84]  we're talking about earlier amd graphics gets a massive performance increase in linux 3.1
[2977.84 --> 2984.42]  um 0.2 more specifically i believe but this even freaked out and surprised the guys that work on
[2984.42 --> 2990.42]  the amd driver for linux they were like holy crap is this actually real um if you can grab the pc per
[2990.42 --> 2998.58]  article um basically there's not a lot to say about it apparently um but like pc pers i think this is one
[2998.58 --> 3002.92]  of the shortest articles i've seen on pc per because one thing i noticed that he likes to do is write
[3002.92 --> 3007.66]  the longest articles ever but i guess this isn't by the main dude so that makes sense
[3007.66 --> 3013.88]  um but basically there's a one to fifty percent improvement in most games and in some select few
[3013.88 --> 3020.28]  games up to ninety percent improvement on graphics performance like what the hell just happened
[3020.28 --> 3025.70]  so there's in the game man there's well linux kernel updates it wasn't even amd that's the crazy part
[3025.70 --> 3033.20]  the amd driver guys were surprised they were like what the heck they're super stoked because it's so
[3033.20 --> 3041.90]  much better um it was a kernel update that was crazy so in my mind how this went down no idea if
[3041.90 --> 3046.52]  this is how it actually worked but in my mind how this went down is linus torbos was pissed at
[3046.52 --> 3053.16]  nvidia and then nvidia's like oh we're gonna come back now that dyson valve care about you um and
[3053.16 --> 3057.82]  he's basically like uh he gave him the finger in a press conference press conference and said
[3057.82 --> 3064.26]  sorry they were uh linus torbos yeah yeah yeah gave nvidia the finger really and this was a bit ago
[3064.26 --> 3069.58]  basically saying because nvidia is the hardest hardware manufacturer of any hardware manufacturer
[3069.58 --> 3074.28]  for them to work with really apparently they just refuse to be helpful in any way so linus torbos
[3074.28 --> 3077.34]  gave them the finger and they're like yeah they're incredibly difficult to work with blah blah blah
[3077.34 --> 3082.44]  they have an independent team that works on their driver and like all this it's crazy um
[3082.44 --> 3086.76]  and then if he did it's like oh we're coming back because people care about you now and then
[3086.76 --> 3093.56]  nvidia goes and goes oh but we're gonna take support away from the driver for like crazy amounts of gp uh
[3093.56 --> 3099.88]  monitors and make it three because we don't want to compete with windows too much so i think in my
[3099.88 --> 3103.66]  mind there must have been something going on behind the scenes and linus torbos was probably like you
[3103.66 --> 3109.90]  know what screw you power turtle update boom i hope there's something like that that went down because
[3109.90 --> 3115.10]  this is awesome what do you think about this well the so the thing i think definitely i think you
[3115.10 --> 3122.70]  hit the nail on the head there because nvidia didn't give a crap about no linux right and all of a sudden
[3122.70 --> 3130.08]  the quote-unquote third console is coming out yeah right because steam box it's a pc but you know let's
[3130.08 --> 3136.96]  call it the third console yeah from a chip standpoint sure and when they made that decision to go linux
[3136.96 --> 3144.08]  all of a sudden they decided to video decided to like oh crap we're gonna have a third place that
[3144.08 --> 3150.36]  our cards and chips aren't gonna be yeah i mean imagine the coup would have been if if only amd would
[3150.36 --> 3156.02]  have worked that yeah yeah seriously right um people were even worried at the start of the steam machine
[3156.02 --> 3161.44]  thing because all the all the pre-done specs for all the steam machines had nvidia cards but nope not
[3161.44 --> 3165.22]  only are they fully modular so you can change it however you want but valve has already said that they
[3165.22 --> 3170.04]  will be shipping steam machines with amd cards in them yeah that's what i saw that uh right when it
[3170.04 --> 3176.16]  came out everybody was like oh my god they're only uh nvidia cards and immediately valve comes out and
[3176.16 --> 3181.78]  goes no no no no no that's just what we put in these 300 machines like it's really okay yeah yeah
[3181.78 --> 3190.22]  that's awesome and then yeah it'll be interesting to see um but i i think you're right i think this is uh
[3190.22 --> 3196.04]  you know somebody pissed somebody off and somebody decided that they were gonna show
[3196.04 --> 3201.88]  a certain company what happens when you piss him off yeah yeah exactly if it's your company if you
[3201.88 --> 3207.94]  are a huge piece of linux power to you and i absolutely you know what if they're not cooperating
[3207.94 --> 3212.90]  with you i you know i try to be a nice guy but if they're not if they're not giving you something
[3212.90 --> 3219.82]  why should you you know it's it's it's uh push pull and it's super exciting because gaming on linux
[3219.82 --> 3225.12]  to be completely honest and i i know there's going to be linux lovers out there i love linux deep down
[3225.12 --> 3231.24]  it's great but honestly guys it wasn't that good gaming on linux was not that good we could wine
[3231.24 --> 3235.92]  whatever we wanted um wine was this little application so you could run windows programs and
[3235.92 --> 3241.14]  stuff but it was mainly used for games i used to try and run wow through wine and we can do whatever
[3241.14 --> 3247.96]  we wanted but it was really not that good so it's nice that this kind of stuff is happening now
[3247.96 --> 3251.76]  because it's going to be the performance is going to be there because one thing that linux has always
[3251.76 --> 3256.26]  been known for is this beast performance because it's so lightweight so if you get even more like
[3256.26 --> 3260.96]  this it's just oh that's awesome steam box around the corner steam machine sorry and all this other
[3260.96 --> 3266.06]  kind of stuff dice backing up linux like crazy valve backing up linux like crazy this is good i'm excited
[3266.06 --> 3271.00]  i'm really excited windows hopefully it works for microsoft this is awkward windows
[3271.00 --> 3275.88]  hopefully takes notes and pays a little attention to what's going on and we're going to switch
[3275.88 --> 3282.20]  topics because that just got really awkward anyways uh i will say one thing real quick i actually i know
[3282.20 --> 3290.50]  quite a few people that um you know like me personally i'm going to try to get uh the steam machine to
[3290.50 --> 3297.88]  run in a vt right in a virtual session yeah because i don't want to you know windows is where most
[3297.88 --> 3304.04]  people do their productivity right i've used adobe for linux and it's junk and i need adobe on my pc
[3304.04 --> 3309.98]  right i just need that productivity software that does really well on the console that it's or on the
[3309.98 --> 3315.36]  platform that it's written for the thing where you know but at the same time i don't want to have to
[3315.36 --> 3321.64]  have two pcs if i have to run you know linux and windows to do work i just have like a 30 foot
[3321.64 --> 3328.16]  hdmi cable that runs to my tv and when i want to game uh with my xbox controller i just you know
[3328.16 --> 3334.50]  sit down and flip the input over to my tv um you know if i can do that and still be able to switch
[3334.50 --> 3341.04]  back and forth between uh linux and windows i think everybody wins in reality because it's going to drive
[3341.04 --> 3347.96]  pc sales which is good for microsoft it's going to drive gaming which is good for all of us yeah
[3347.96 --> 3355.12]  um and it it helps an open platform that you know realistically guys they don't make any money
[3355.12 --> 3360.54]  off of that open platform i have friends that do open gl and open cl stuff um you know that could be
[3360.54 --> 3367.82]  making lots of money at nvidia or amd and they just do it for fun so i used to try now i was terrible so i
[3367.82 --> 3372.50]  don't even know if i did anything constructive but i used to try and help with the wine project
[3372.50 --> 3377.54]  um mainly what i would do is testing but yeah like talking to some of the guys in there
[3377.54 --> 3381.78]  there were some pretty high-end guys that worked for some pretty high-end companies and put in
[3381.78 --> 3387.00]  beastly amounts of time in their spare time trying to help work all this stuff there's a lot of
[3387.00 --> 3391.44]  companies out there that aren't profitable really that put towards this open open platform movement
[3391.44 --> 3395.86]  so it's actually quite interesting that it's now becoming it's now likely to become much more
[3395.86 --> 3405.14]  mainstream um one other thing that i found really funny that's in here actually i wanted to touch on
[3405.14 --> 3409.00]  this but i don't i have no idea where this conversation is going to go um it wasn't in
[3409.00 --> 3414.18]  the guest topics but i wanted to bring it up now problems with journalism now a hilarious reason
[3414.18 --> 3419.24]  why this is coming up right now is that we okay i slightly screwed up earlier when we're talking about
[3419.24 --> 3426.00]  the blizzard free at last um the title and what was in that post was a little bit confusing so when i
[3426.00 --> 3430.48]  skimmed over it i didn't properly read it so it's more activision that freed itself not
[3430.48 --> 3436.54]  blizzard specifically it's more specifically activision so we're going to jump back to the
[3436.54 --> 3442.62]  next topic which is hilariously the next topic because it's about the sun talking about serif
[3442.62 --> 3450.66]  industries a company in deus x which made um cybernetic implants so if we jump to your screen
[3450.66 --> 3456.96]  it's in the newspaper and they're talking about cybernetic implants from serif industries the best
[3456.96 --> 3462.22]  part is that it's printed on the thing in the picture serif and if you google it it's very
[3462.22 --> 3467.42]  obviously from a game but they start talking about serif industries there's even well yeah this isn't
[3467.42 --> 3472.52]  the sun's website right right yeah yeah so um so yeah and they're talking about how it's serif
[3472.52 --> 3476.96]  industries a u.s firm blah blah blah has developed an eyeball implant blah blah blah like it's not a
[3476.96 --> 3482.96]  super big article but it's just kind of hilarious it's in the sun but honestly it really shows what a
[3482.96 --> 3488.26]  joke news is today yeah that's that's we're kind of getting to like personal beliefs right now but i
[3488.26 --> 3494.20]  have strayed away from listening to the news because you know i'd rather get my fiction from something
[3494.20 --> 3499.46]  like a warcraft novel you know um like if we if we look like there was an article that came out saying
[3499.46 --> 3506.26]  in toronto started on some forum um what they did do and i i can't remember what level it was but
[3506.26 --> 3511.10]  um some sort of community soccer where kids just kind of show up and play i'm not sure if it was at
[3511.10 --> 3516.42]  school or not but they they didn't keep score that's that's totally cool that's totally fine
[3516.42 --> 3522.64]  and then an article came out saying on cbc which if you live in canada that's kind of our government
[3522.64 --> 3528.90]  news network um saying that they took the ball away to make it you know no one scores it's like
[3528.90 --> 3534.10]  they they're supposed to imagine that the ball is there not true didn't happen but someone wrote it
[3534.10 --> 3540.28]  on the internet and cbc said it was true another thing that happened because breaking bad is really
[3540.28 --> 3545.80]  popular i thought i thought the cbc thing was an elaborate troll by cbc wasn't an elaborate troll i
[3545.80 --> 3552.20]  heard they just report it wrong either way because the guys that elaborate troll cbc you should not do
[3552.20 --> 3557.94]  that you are you should not be trolling you are a nationwide news network i agree so if if you are
[3557.94 --> 3562.42]  correct shame on them still there was another article that came right out of vancouver uh this was about
[3562.42 --> 3568.10]  two weeks ago a rv was driving over one of the many bridges we have it was on fire and it was
[3568.10 --> 3573.72]  immediately reported on all the news networks that it was a meth lab on fire why because breaking bad
[3573.72 --> 3581.04]  just ended a week earlier guess what not a meth lab nothing to do with meth they stole the gas they
[3581.04 --> 3587.38]  stole gas not a meth lab because gas is like expensive and worth a lot we are actually living
[3587.38 --> 3593.60]  in the most expensive city for gasoline or petrol the lower mainland has all 10 of the most expensive
[3593.60 --> 3599.54]  cities to buy gas in north america yeah thanks for tax but it's just yeah it just goes to say that
[3599.54 --> 3605.66]  news these days my goodness ridiculous and like we screwed up but i don't think we screwed up as bad as
[3605.66 --> 3609.46]  that i don't know either way um i just thought that was actually pretty hilarious i had something
[3609.46 --> 3615.56]  oh yeah the sun is apparently just a joke in general like i read the comments on this article
[3615.56 --> 3619.84]  and it was just ridiculous and i talked to some people from where it's actually published and they
[3619.84 --> 3624.70]  said yeah that magazine's just ridiculous but how do these things exist like you go to the grocery
[3624.70 --> 3629.48]  store and you always see them on the rack as you're leaving and it's like two aliens found in the desert
[3629.48 --> 3634.04]  dissected and we're gonna die in two days and it's like how is that newspaper even if you look i'm gonna
[3634.04 --> 3638.80]  switch back even if you look at this article that you can see picture it's talking something about its
[3638.80 --> 3645.60]  vehicle right uses lasers google maps satellites complex algorithms and a tremendous amount of data 750
[3645.60 --> 3653.64]  megabytes per second to navigate the road ahead well and the next one is star trek tricorder so
[3653.64 --> 3660.46]  yeah yeah it's so this whole article is uh this is but how do these how are they still around
[3660.46 --> 3667.20]  i don't there's so many things so many things like the tabloidy magazines that you see in the
[3667.20 --> 3673.60]  marketplace that everyone knows are just completely bullshit how is that still a thing cyrus makes music
[3673.60 --> 3679.42]  we'll never know we'll never know how things work out i don't even mind her song that much the music
[3679.42 --> 3686.24]  video is just ridiculous you know what the song you know the song's not even bad segue until she the
[3686.24 --> 3691.10]  chorus i don't like like the wrecking ball part but the leading she's actually a talented singer and
[3691.10 --> 3695.68]  there's an amazing clip that you can find um i won't go bring it up you can go search for yourself
[3695.68 --> 3701.74]  but miley cyrus is a good-looking lady besides when she cuts her hair and sticks her tongue out and does all
[3701.74 --> 3707.86]  these crazy things and there's a clip going she says i love when i watch videos of uh a celebrity
[3707.86 --> 3712.02]  she's saying this and you go what you know what you used to be so beautiful what what did you do to
[3712.02 --> 3717.64]  yourself and you're just like oh damn you know the rage comics where the face goes like way out of it
[3717.64 --> 3725.36]  that's what i want to do that's fine all right so now next topic which again we do like we do a
[3725.36 --> 3730.56]  topic let me talk about amd let me do a topic let me talk about amd um so we're going to talk about
[3730.56 --> 3737.66]  amd again um amd swings a profit in quarter three of 48 million dollars now this might if you're
[3737.66 --> 3744.86]  looking at like the scale of how big this company is that might not seem that ridiculous but they
[3744.86 --> 3751.10]  haven't been swinging profits for kind of a long time so it's really nice to see them back in the
[3751.10 --> 3756.38]  game we've seen a lot of news this week about them being back in the game so it's kind of awesome to
[3756.38 --> 3760.44]  see them pulling a profit because the more they actually pull a profit instead of you losing all
[3760.44 --> 3764.96]  the millions ever like they've been doing for a long time they can actually start getting more
[3764.96 --> 3770.10]  money into that rnd they can start getting more money into the cpu side the gpu side everything
[3770.10 --> 3775.64]  i'm interested to see what timmy thinks about this yeah yeah well the first thing i think as a amd
[3775.64 --> 3781.04]  stockholder is that the good god they lost 56 cents a share today that yeah
[3781.04 --> 3790.88]  yeah so that's got you know almost 14 percent down um it's this is the one of those things where
[3790.88 --> 3798.82]  like everybody's like oh my god the world is ending pcs are dying right nobody's buying pcs anymore but
[3798.82 --> 3805.60]  10 years ago how many people did you know that had a five-year-old pc like almost nobody now how many
[3805.60 --> 3810.80]  people you know how many do you know that have a five-year-old pc like everybody i know that's not
[3810.80 --> 3816.56]  me almost right i mean because if you're not doing like you know rendering or hardcore gaming there's
[3816.56 --> 3821.38]  you know your xp system is probably still just fine for your email and playing pogo on the internet
[3821.38 --> 3828.30]  right i mean so i think the problem with analysts in this situation is that they're looking at like
[3828.30 --> 3836.60]  you know where's the pc market in you know 10 years well if video games are easier to port to the pc
[3836.60 --> 3844.36]  and make look better and the steam pc come or the steam uh os comes out and you get all this stuff
[3844.36 --> 3850.96]  where you know you can see the trend right now is people are shifting back from consoles to the pc
[3850.96 --> 3857.00]  yeah yeah and i think you know the fact that this is i think somebody i was reading one of the articles
[3857.00 --> 3862.62]  on this where they were saying uh it was like two quarters earlier than they thought that they were
[3862.62 --> 3868.32]  going to make a profit again yeah right so they were they were projecting like q1 of next year
[3868.32 --> 3876.72]  the to make a profit basically when all the consoles start selling right yeah so i think some of this
[3876.72 --> 3881.78]  48 million is because of the consoles that have already been made yeah definitely right i think i think
[3881.78 --> 3890.18]  that's some of it but long term i think especially from you know the value that you get from their product i
[3890.18 --> 3895.22]  i don't think they're going away and i think they're just going to keep kind of shifting to be
[3895.22 --> 3900.76]  more profitable i i think they're headed back in the right direction and one thing that i want to
[3900.76 --> 3905.26]  segue out of what you just said actually is the whole thing with pc gaming not necessarily going
[3905.26 --> 3910.18]  away it's just people aren't upgrading as fast is the graphic that is on screen right now that was
[3910.18 --> 3913.88]  actually put up by nvidia i know we're talking about amd right now but who cares we're fans of both
[3913.88 --> 3919.70]  um and this is interesting now i don't know if all these specs are pc gaming by itself because they
[3919.70 --> 3924.24]  bring up stuff like uh call of duty or if that's all of it i don't remember the numbers for call
[3924.24 --> 3929.24]  of duty but i'm i think that might be all of call of duty not just the pc side uh but they're showing
[3929.24 --> 3939.24]  like the 2013 stanley cup final got 8.2 million viewers the 2012 lol championship got 8.3 million
[3939.24 --> 3946.82]  viewers is that supposed to be the 2013 lol championship um it's nvidia graphics so what it says on the
[3946.82 --> 3951.54]  nvidia graphics is the 2012 lol championship 2013 was pretty recent yeah so they might not have the
[3951.54 --> 3956.08]  numbers on that i'm not well actually no they probably do maybe i'm not sure when either either
[3956.08 --> 3963.26]  way um like like a pc gaming tournament beat out the 2013 stanley cup final and league has only grown
[3963.26 --> 3968.82]  so you would imagine that probably only going to is higher yeah yeah so that's monstrous and the nfl
[3968.82 --> 3975.02]  more than nfl nfl is huge and an amazing amazing industry in the states if you don't know much about
[3975.02 --> 3979.82]  the nfl you don't even have to know about sports they actually run on a socialist ideal um they
[3979.82 --> 3984.40]  share money amongst teams that's why they're so incredibly successful as opposed to mlb which
[3984.40 --> 3989.12]  always has the same teams winning essentially you know what i mean it's always new york just has too
[3989.12 --> 3997.96]  much money and um but nfl revenue nine and a half billion dollars virtual goods 15 15 billion dollars
[3997.96 --> 4006.56]  billion dollars just ridiculous hours played quarter one 2013 13.5 billion for just the top 20 games
[4006.56 --> 4014.62]  netflix was four billion yeah like holy crap i had that was the one that i was gonna say out of all of
[4014.62 --> 4020.52]  these that was the number that made me go like whoa the 13.5 billion hours yeah yeah that was
[4020.52 --> 4026.20]  because everybody i know watches netflix yeah me too and like we'll idle it quite often and just have
[4026.20 --> 4030.98]  it in the background or whatever so like that's insane so all the people that think pc gaming is
[4030.98 --> 4036.66]  dying check out this little graphic i have never people jump on the dying boat so quickly yeah i've
[4036.66 --> 4044.50]  never been on it i have never thought pc game was dying truly because we get a lot of the games that
[4044.50 --> 4048.92]  the console gamers get you know they make them for all titles and we get so many games that are to our
[4048.92 --> 4053.74]  own like we're gonna jump back to it for a second but i'm just doing it for the numbers world of
[4053.74 --> 4058.84]  warcraft's not mentioned on here what is the revenue for that game over the past decade
[4058.84 --> 4064.14]  monstrous oh my goodness i don't even want to throw a number because it'd be too small someone in the
[4064.14 --> 4071.40]  chat just said 13.5 billion hours filthy casuals yes i do agree you're navigating away and you're on
[4071.40 --> 4078.78]  sorry sorry okay um but yeah so the one okay so pc gaming in my mind didn't it hasn't necessarily
[4078.78 --> 4085.54]  died but it did kind of dwindle for a bit xbox 360 and ps3 rained pretty hard there for a while
[4085.54 --> 4091.98]  it's true but we're getting out of that swing and pc gaming is back baby unlike that guy because he
[4091.98 --> 4097.36]  didn't really come back properly but i think pc gaming came back properly well and i think you know if
[4097.36 --> 4103.70]  you eventually see you know they have developer connects for pc right but you can't really play
[4103.70 --> 4108.10]  games with those i think if you saw something like the connect come out for the pc as well
[4108.10 --> 4116.20]  or the steam box or whatever that you would see those casual gamers starting to say why do i need a
[4116.20 --> 4122.08]  console when my pc can actually do everything i want it to do yeah that's a really good point and i think
[4122.08 --> 4128.02]  there's going to be i think new things are going to drive a lot of hype for pc gaming as well like
[4128.02 --> 4134.62]  uh we've seen stuff like oculus rift i know that's definitely not as mass consumer friendly as say a
[4134.62 --> 4141.12]  connect um by mass consumer friendly i mean the the random people aren't going to go to a store and be
[4141.12 --> 4145.64]  like oh what should i buy for my kid i'm gonna buy him an oculus rift i don't think that's going to
[4145.64 --> 4150.04]  happen quite yet because it's a little bit more hardcore a connect you can put up in your room and it's a
[4150.04 --> 4153.70]  family room or whatever and it's a very casual situation so it's going to be open to more people
[4153.70 --> 4158.96]  that way but if you're a gamer a pretty hardcore gamer and you've been on console for a while but
[4158.96 --> 4163.80]  you liked pc in the past and you want to try something new you're probably going to go for pc
[4163.80 --> 4172.88]  and an oculus rift so i do think like not necessarily um just games just big mmos and stuff that can only
[4172.88 --> 4177.68]  be released on a pc are going to be what's going to drive stuff onto pc obviously mobas right now
[4177.68 --> 4182.84]  is happening huge it's helping everyone's making one at pax yeah you know there they must have been
[4182.84 --> 4191.32]  what three mobas right really smite blizzard's new thing uh what's uh the one with heroes of new earth
[4191.32 --> 4197.74]  there was one right the superhero ones yeah the superhero one that had ax laugh and axle toss
[4197.74 --> 4203.14]  casting i can't even remember what it was called which is so it was like dc heroes or something something
[4203.14 --> 4207.92]  yeah i was just there to meet them and get their signature i wasn't really sure what the mob was
[4207.92 --> 4212.58]  about but i definitely wanted to meet uh both those guys apparently me cracking my neck hurt people's
[4212.58 --> 4218.42]  ears oh really sure as you i've done i've done a couple good pops oops probably both have i just
[4218.42 --> 4222.92]  went yeah i just went for a go maybe it might have been you actually now what we were talking about
[4222.92 --> 4230.38]  with the oculus rift and um oh shoot help me for one second oculus rift pc the xbox connect connect
[4230.38 --> 4234.54]  thank you i don't know why that happened um but something i've said since the beginning of the
[4234.54 --> 4238.58]  connect and the oculus rift i'm going to make myself unpopular for a second hopefully just for a second
[4238.58 --> 4245.68]  but i am not hugely into that technology yet but i'm extraordinarily excited to see where it's going
[4245.68 --> 4250.02]  to go version two or whatever yeah i got an oculus rift coming i have a dev kit it should be coming this
[4250.02 --> 4254.70]  month they're they're cool don't get me wrong but i'm not like oh my god all i want to do today is go
[4254.70 --> 4259.84]  play my oculus i'm not really there yet and the connect isn't really i am i a lot of people are
[4259.84 --> 4262.68]  oculus rift that's what i'm that's what i'm saying i'm going to make myself a little bit
[4262.68 --> 4265.78]  unpopular there might be some people with agree with me and if you're on the boat right now that's
[4265.78 --> 4271.56]  awesome i support you but i'm just i'm not necessarily totally jumping into the pool yet
[4271.56 --> 4276.92]  i'm but i'm really excited to see where it's going to go because it is only going to develop
[4276.92 --> 4282.72]  exponentially yeah and i'm totally with you guys no go for it did you guys check out uh well
[4282.72 --> 4289.60]  winas did that video on the omni right yep that thing is cool that's really cool you know the fact
[4289.60 --> 4296.56]  that you have like positioning and the oculus rift and you can run and jump and turn
[4296.56 --> 4303.12]  um you know with an actual you know gun that's basically your controller that's using
[4303.12 --> 4310.54]  um tracking to know where you're pointing uh my only comment was does it come in 3xl but
[4310.54 --> 4317.88]  i'm with you buddy yeah no i actually when we went to go test it i don't know if you saw this footage
[4317.88 --> 4326.02]  but i tried it out too and uh it at that point in time was not in 3xl if we can say it was not
[4326.02 --> 4332.50]  tall enough actually my waist was too high and my feet were too big so i had to go with i think i
[4332.50 --> 4338.02]  was in my socks or no they found shoes that fit me if i wore them as if i was a rock climber so my
[4338.02 --> 4341.96]  toes were like that in the end which was terrible and then it was too high so i couldn't wear the belt
[4341.96 --> 4346.12]  so i was trying to go around in the omni while just like holding on to it my hand to support my
[4346.12 --> 4349.60]  that's that's a different topic i kind of i don't want to include that in what i was saying
[4349.60 --> 4353.90]  with because that is really if i could play that every day i probably would that's not something
[4353.90 --> 4358.52]  everyone can put in their living room exactly yeah it's too it's one of the problems with that is
[4358.52 --> 4365.16]  it's too big so it has that the it has the adaptation problem that oculus rift does but in
[4365.16 --> 4371.18]  a different way oculus rift is quite hardcore um omni is still really hardcore but at least your
[4371.18 --> 4377.30]  open area which automatically makes things a little bit more easy to adopt um but it's big
[4377.30 --> 4381.80]  and it's not really collapsible so you need kind of a dedicated area for it to go which is interesting
[4381.80 --> 4387.32]  someone wants to know what size your shoes are what are they 13 13 13 13 yeah um they're not like
[4387.32 --> 4394.34]  monstrous but when in in like the kit that they brought to our meeting they didn't have any in
[4394.34 --> 4400.72]  there yet i i'm like 99.9 sure you can get shoes big enough for me i'm bigger now um but they only
[4400.72 --> 4409.30]  had like three different kinds of shoes there 13 is the sandals for lions do they have sandals for
[4409.30 --> 4415.38]  linus uh i don't think they did actually i can't remember what they had built in socks with sandals
[4415.38 --> 4422.12]  built built it wow that's fantastic um specially developed sebastian sandals that's what they're
[4422.12 --> 4426.94]  called he had converse they had converse shoes for linus and converse was like wow this isn't even
[4426.94 --> 4431.40]  a company anymore where do you find these and i was like wow i'm not up on fashion but you have no
[4431.40 --> 4436.84]  idea what you're talking about yeah converse is definitely yeah definitely a thing i was like i don't
[4436.84 --> 4446.58]  often go out you actually just don't go out at all like jeez man oh jeez okay so give me one sec
[4446.58 --> 4449.94]  and i think we can jump into the other topic unless one of you guys have more to say
[4449.94 --> 4458.88]  i'm pretty good all right so what do we have now um nexus 5 leaked on the play store there isn't a ton
[4458.88 --> 4466.08]  of information about this but it's back soon for the wan show just the title i could change that
[4466.08 --> 4471.34]  not a huge deal it's probably too late now um nexus 5 leaked on the wan show we're gonna jump to
[4471.34 --> 4478.84]  richard's screen right now um i'm cold at the thank you cold at the screen right now my bad um
[4478.84 --> 4486.46]  interesting but it looks really cool there's not really a lot of information we've already seen
[4486.46 --> 4492.62]  like the only thing that i really got from this was the fact that it was 349 dollars i think that's
[4492.62 --> 4497.58]  kind of the main piece of information to get yeah you know because there's there's been better photos
[4497.58 --> 4501.26]  leaked already yeah i've seen better photos of this leaked already there was photos leaked with
[4501.26 --> 4507.84]  teles logo on it which was just i was like what really oh okay weird because they're like only
[4507.84 --> 4512.74]  here yeah i'm like oh um but yeah there's there's photos leaked with teles logo all over it which was
[4512.74 --> 4520.78]  kind of funny um linus is tweeting things to me why doesn't he text me or something what a silly man
[4520.78 --> 4526.24]  give me one second oh i can't find it because there's so many tweets from other people
[4526.24 --> 4532.76]  uh but yeah it looks really cool the thing is they're gonna have a lot of competition there's
[4532.76 --> 4538.58]  so many cool phones coming out and i know you guys um should be releasing a note 3 video
[4538.58 --> 4542.64]  pretty quickly which is going to be a very interesting phone so the competition in phones
[4542.64 --> 4547.60]  right now is incredible um things like cyanogen mod coming out and trying to develop into something
[4547.60 --> 4554.06]  that's one click i'm gonna pause you for one quick second everyone tweet um at slick pc and uh
[4554.06 --> 4561.40]  one second and at timmy tech tv and at cold sc all in one big thing with questions for timmy tech tv
[4561.40 --> 4568.86]  i forgot to do a twitter blitz we'll be doing a twitter blitz soon um so tweet them questions and keep
[4568.86 --> 4574.60]  going you're talking about cyanogen mod i'm just saying it's a really interesting error for phones right
[4574.60 --> 4579.94]  now it's tech right now is awesome because i felt like it was a little dry there maybe for a bit
[4579.94 --> 4583.82]  but with the video cards are coming out amd's stepping up and video's having to step up their
[4583.82 --> 4588.88]  game the new consoles are going to come out which is going to exponentially make pc games better which
[4588.88 --> 4595.44]  is why i'm excited for the consoles to come out uh you've got the steam box coming out um all the all
[4595.44 --> 4600.12]  the different phones like the note 3 is coming out looks amazing this new nexus phone is coming out
[4600.12 --> 4606.70]  you know it's it's a really good time uh to be to be around and in technology yeah for sure and like
[4606.70 --> 4613.24]  uh uh 4.4 is going to be coming with this phone as well see that's awesome 4.4 is awesome i'm
[4613.24 --> 4619.10]  actually more excited for cyanogen mod to become something that is easier to implement yeah but
[4619.10 --> 4625.20]  then cyanogen model will get 4.4 too oh no yes yes sorry yeah i didn't mean to yeah discredit that
[4625.20 --> 4630.20]  part of it but yeah yeah exactly um one interesting thing that they stated was capture the everyday
[4630.20 --> 4635.54]  and the epic in fresh new ways now i might have missed some leaks or something but i'm not entirely
[4635.54 --> 4642.94]  sure what they mean by that now the people saying um linus tweeted me something about a 290x i checked
[4642.94 --> 4650.78]  his twitter i don't see anything from him i'm not entirely sure what you guys are talking about
[4650.78 --> 4658.90]  i would expect more nvidia styled tweets well do we want to do uh twitter blitz we can jump into the
[4658.90 --> 4665.76]  twitter blitz now that makes a lot of sense let's refresh sounds good all right so these questions are
[4665.76 --> 4672.78]  directed at timmy if i can oh no that's the wrong one whoop there we go
[4672.78 --> 4681.90]  no idea oh geez don't play it
[4681.90 --> 4686.40]  apparently we've got comments so far
[4686.40 --> 4694.62]  best phone for under 450 unlocked other than the nexus 5
[4694.62 --> 4699.84]  what's i don't know the buyout prices i'm not very good at that
[4699.84 --> 4707.06]  i don't know the buyout prices either actually yeah i think the the mega might be around that
[4707.06 --> 4711.76]  price with the buyout because it's pretty cheap so if you're looking for a big phone
[4711.76 --> 4718.36]  yeah that i actually held one the other day um it's insane personally i think the note 2 is
[4718.36 --> 4723.56]  a little too big the note 3 is a little bit smaller which is awesome the mega
[4723.56 --> 4731.52]  this is monstrous what like it makes the note 2 look like my s3 like when you compare the note 2
[4731.52 --> 4738.54]  and s3 side by side that's the same maybe uh fraction of difference i'm i'm failing on my
[4738.54 --> 4745.60]  vocabulary right now but the yeah exactly the scales um between the mega and the and and my s and uh the
[4745.60 --> 4750.28]  note 2 it's kind of the same difference there it's the mega is ridiculous giant i've never actually
[4750.28 --> 4756.08]  seen one in real life it's ridiculous it's basically a tablet oh it's with the sim card that you can call
[4756.08 --> 4762.08]  yeah i was gonna say i have a i have a um a galaxy uh three
[4762.08 --> 4769.56]  seven inch you know the tab just a tablet without the sim and it's the same size as that
[4769.56 --> 4775.98]  i mean it's not seven inches exactly but it's like the same size so it's ridiculous
[4775.98 --> 4785.30]  this article is saying 6.3 yeah it seems huge yeah it and honestly the screen isn't because it's so
[4785.30 --> 4790.50]  huge um i only used it for a second in the store it's not as if i reviewed it i wasn't overly impressed
[4790.50 --> 4797.24]  with the screen no no yeah no i didn't the tablets the 199 tablets look better to me yeah wow yeah
[4797.24 --> 4802.30]  geez that's interesting i'm gonna go on something a little left field here i could be completely wrong
[4802.30 --> 4810.06]  so please timmy correct me or or or yourself slick um was not the mega released in asia first and then
[4810.06 --> 4815.88]  brought over here significantly later and not upgraded yeah see i thought it was i thought it
[4815.88 --> 4823.38]  was released in south korea and and uh japan makes sense yeah i think when i was in korea a lot of people
[4823.38 --> 4829.52]  have large form factor phones right were really popular right it yeah i could be completely wrong about
[4829.52 --> 4833.62]  that maybe we'll get a tweet or something but i yeah no i think i think you're right yeah it was
[4833.62 --> 4838.80]  released overseas first uh japan korea and not upgraded and then brought here significantly later
[4838.80 --> 4844.26]  and in phone time you know phone time is so much worse than dog years you know phone years you know
[4844.26 --> 4848.98]  one year in a phone year is it might as well be 30 yeah human years you know for crying out loud yeah
[4848.98 --> 4858.18]  uh so i got one here uh sure they were asking about uh any higher than 1080p monitors with displayport for
[4858.18 --> 4864.12]  under 400 bucks um if you're going to go under 400 depends on the size obviously you're only probably
[4864.12 --> 4871.90]  going to see that in something like a 27 or a 30 inch what where i buy my monitors from is mono price
[4871.90 --> 4878.92]  because you can get basically they take like lg and samsung panels that don't pass all the quality
[4878.92 --> 4885.24]  tests rebrand them as mono price monitors remove whatever features failed the quality test and then sell
[4885.24 --> 4893.10]  them for like half the price interesting so i bought it like my 27 inch mono price monitor was
[4893.10 --> 4903.40]  like 349 and it's a uh 1440p ips it's like it's mono price is a really really interesting that's really
[4903.40 --> 4910.62]  cool and they so i buy all my cables and everything through mono price they they you know so they will
[4910.62 --> 4915.30]  say that these are you know second party basically panels right i mean they're getting them they're
[4915.30 --> 4919.90]  failing quality tests and they're they're taking features away from them they don't shy away from
[4919.90 --> 4926.24]  that they're like hey you know if you can do without like these two features then you know save half
[4926.24 --> 4931.04]  price basically right and they're brand new you know they have full mono price warranties and
[4931.04 --> 4937.12]  they're brand new it's not like they were returned or you know there's their second hand it's just that
[4937.12 --> 4941.78]  you know they they're not good enough for whatever model samsung or whatever model most of them are lg
[4941.78 --> 4953.34]  um monitors i i love mine no dead pixels no uh backlight bleed it you know for what i paid for it i can
[4953.34 --> 4959.94]  complain at all yeah uh we've got a new question on screen so how do you feel about nvidia's reveal of
[4959.94 --> 4961.96]  the gtx 780 ti
[4961.96 --> 4976.02]  um yeah you know personally i don't like the ti monikers myself uh it seems like they originally
[4976.02 --> 4981.98]  yeah titanium it seems like they originally created the ti moniker so that they could you know like i
[4981.98 --> 4988.78]  said earlier so that they could rebrand something that they were holding off on in reaction to something
[4988.78 --> 4995.74]  that amd does right because you don't really see a lot of amd doing that you know you might now
[4995.74 --> 5001.44]  though because you notice they have the x and the non-x moniker yeah yeah so we might start seeing that
[5001.44 --> 5009.22]  from amd as well but it just makes it hard you know as a consumer like oh well what's different why is it
[5009.22 --> 5018.60]  different how much better is the performance you know price per dollar um if it makes 780 go down in
[5018.60 --> 5027.24]  price and it's roughly a titanium with less ram for 700 i'll be doing backflips to you know newegg or
[5027.24 --> 5033.62]  amazon to buy one oh titan if it's roughly a titan with less ram so you mean right yeah okay yeah sorry
[5033.62 --> 5039.40]  a titan that's cool um yeah it's it's it's interesting and i i kind of agree with the ti moniker thing
[5039.40 --> 5044.74]  um and but with a slightly different angle i've always kind of understood the benchmarks because i've
[5044.74 --> 5049.36]  been running them for a long time um but from someone from the outside of i've seen people
[5049.36 --> 5056.14]  comment like okay well is this 660 ti better than a 670 like without looking at the benchmarks they're
[5056.14 --> 5060.34]  like what is this ti thing what does it actually mean in what way is it actually better they're not
[5060.34 --> 5065.06]  looking into the deep specs of it they're not going out and actually figuring out what's different
[5065.06 --> 5068.30]  they're going like what am i supposed to buy why is there all these different revisions of different
[5068.30 --> 5072.52]  things now to me it's a little bit more simple than that i don't think it's actually that
[5072.52 --> 5078.22]  complicated in the naming convention but it's it's it's very likely to do with what you're talking
[5078.22 --> 5086.60]  about which is where it's it's very likely just oh we made this thing but we don't we kind of need
[5086.60 --> 5090.44]  to push it out now so let's just kind of change the name and push it out and then we'll deal with
[5090.44 --> 5098.68]  other stuff later let's move on uh where is the screen right now up a little bit there we go
[5098.68 --> 5107.94]  guys asking is it worth it for him to get rid of his 1280 by 1024 monitors and get a 1440 p1 or keep
[5107.94 --> 5111.10]  my monitors and sli my 660 what do you think kind of
[5111.10 --> 5114.60]  uh
[5114.60 --> 5121.48]  um i don't i don't think you want to sli a 660 right now um
[5121.48 --> 5130.46]  you know i would say depending on what you do with it for me you know 1440 p so i don't i don't
[5130.46 --> 5137.78]  actually game at 1440 p because my main machine has a gtx 670 um and i don't like you know like
[5137.78 --> 5147.12]  bioshock infinite at 1440 p on my card is like 23 frames a second um and that's not a situation i like to
[5147.12 --> 5151.08]  game and i don't like watching and you know you see the tear and stuff just like you know it's
[5151.08 --> 5158.62]  really bad especially the tear um so i tend to game i tend to flip my my panel between the the 1440 and
[5158.62 --> 5164.38]  the the 1080 depending on what i'm doing what i really use the 1440 for is like especially when
[5164.38 --> 5170.92]  i'm editing videos the more real estate you can get for like you know work related things uh the better
[5170.92 --> 5177.14]  off you are so that's what you know i i would say 1440 if you're gonna go over
[5177.14 --> 5184.80]  you're gonna go over 27 inches it's i think 1440 is important but you have to have the video card to
[5184.80 --> 5190.94]  drive it yeah yeah um and one thing to keep in mind too is with his current setup maybe not sli
[5190.94 --> 5195.56]  in the 660 but maybe if you like vendor the 660 like sell it on ebay or something like that
[5195.56 --> 5200.44]  and then upgrade your card directly like get a actual gpu replacement maybe go up 700 series
[5200.44 --> 5207.78]  or something like that um not a terrible idea it's going down no i i actually you know i've
[5207.78 --> 5213.84]  seen linus recommend that before in the past too don't sli a generation old card if you're gonna have
[5213.84 --> 5218.48]  to buy a new one to do it or even a used one right i mean look at how much you could make from selling
[5218.48 --> 5224.70]  your card and that you would be paying for the new card take that performance benchmarks that are all
[5224.70 --> 5229.64]  over the place right and look at the new performance benchmarks and like i bet you could probably buy
[5229.64 --> 5236.42]  as you know a 760 or 770 for the same price yeah yeah definitely not a bad idea now this guy's tweet
[5236.42 --> 5241.22]  not directly going after timmy but i just wanted to bring this up vivendi owned blizzard before wow
[5241.22 --> 5245.72]  the problem is activision not vivendi you guys are mixing stuff up yep notice that in the article it's
[5245.72 --> 5250.32]  just i how it was worded i read it wrong it was just a little bit confusing sorry about that we figured
[5250.32 --> 5257.10]  that out moving on now you've kind of i will say though i will say in in some aspect though
[5257.10 --> 5265.62]  blizzard still made good games after the the activision merger so they may not have been as good as they
[5265.62 --> 5272.58]  were when blizzard was just off by itself but vivendi as a multinational huge distributor
[5272.58 --> 5282.76]  you can see the companies that have gone under them fail horribly so i think i'm just more happy i
[5282.76 --> 5287.26]  would rather activision went back to being activision by itself to be honest with you but that would be
[5287.26 --> 5292.42]  awesome i felt like i felt like they i felt like produced better games before they took over blizzard
[5292.42 --> 5297.44]  i feel like everything was just better when they were just apart um now we've got a tweet that's not
[5297.44 --> 5305.06]  on screen but it says um with overclocking could a regular 780 surpass a 780 ti it might be at the
[5305.06 --> 5313.54]  top oh ah who knows yeah i was actually i was i was letting you take that one because i'm trying to
[5313.54 --> 5319.30]  have this twitter blitz focused on you but we know absolutely nothing about this card uh we know it
[5319.30 --> 5325.82]  is a thing we've seen it's a thing so i guess here's what i would say if you're doing 1080p gaming or
[5325.82 --> 5334.42]  1440p gaming um could a 780 beat a titan they get pretty close in in 1080p gaming because the
[5334.42 --> 5339.28]  what you're getting with what you're getting with the titan is that extra ram right yeah more than
[5339.28 --> 5342.64]  anything i mean you get a few more coup de cores and a little bit more of an overclock but
[5342.64 --> 5351.00]  and an awesome name you know yeah and an awesome name exactly sorry i was gonna say my joke a while
[5351.00 --> 5356.86]  ago was uh uh if if the 290x is really the quote unquote titan killer they should call it like zeus
[5356.86 --> 5361.38]  or something because the olympians killed the titans right yeah that's really good that would be
[5361.38 --> 5366.32]  awesome i loved greek mythology oh they should have done that that would be cool called the zeus card
[5366.32 --> 5371.86]  they should have done that that would have been awesome that was okay they missed a huge possible
[5371.86 --> 5376.72]  marketing ploy with the not not doing 9000 titan killers because everything would have been over
[5376.72 --> 5381.86]  9000 so they missed a huge over 9000 marketing thing and then they missed the titan killers thing
[5381.86 --> 5388.38]  with zeus man man titans were supposed to be more powerful jeez yeah yeah excuse me sorry guys and
[5388.38 --> 5392.52]  then and then that would have just played in oh man good yeah timmy that would have played in so well
[5392.52 --> 5398.20]  uh someone's saying timmy was a good guest if i can scroll up here a little bit it is sorry
[5398.20 --> 5405.10]  timmy is a good guest subscribed so that's cool cool uh he went to pax so that automatically
[5405.10 --> 5410.76]  he went to pax and he enabled a large part of the team to go to pax as well which is really helpful
[5410.76 --> 5418.84]  yeah somehow they somehow they escaped basement though when i wasn't paying attention so
[5418.84 --> 5427.34]  um there's two questions here one how do you think amd's true audio will compare to sound cards and
[5427.34 --> 5434.58]  onboard sound uh i think an important thing to remember is true audio is only going to be on i think
[5434.58 --> 5442.36]  it was the 260x and the 290x is that right i don't remember the exact cards but it's only it's yeah
[5442.36 --> 5453.02]  it's only on two cards it's not on all of them so um gonna be better than on board audio for in my
[5453.02 --> 5461.46]  opinion for sure um the question is you know will there'll be like mantle ish components you know api
[5461.46 --> 5468.00]  level stuff that game developers can hook into um and how well will that be adopted you know it's
[5468.00 --> 5475.94]  just like uh the nvidia g-sync stuff right it's it's how well adopted is it going to be are developers
[5475.94 --> 5481.68]  going to develop for it or is it just going to be this thing where like amd pays you know dice or
[5481.68 --> 5490.54]  somebody to implement this technology like like nvidia does for physics right right yeah but i think
[5490.54 --> 5498.80]  it's sorry keep going i was gonna say you know versus discrete cards uh hard to tell because those
[5498.80 --> 5506.68]  discrete cards are very focused at you know just doing audio codecs really well yeah um one thing too
[5506.68 --> 5511.88]  is that it's not a deck um so right you're gonna have some interesting things there but then it has
[5511.88 --> 5515.80]  interesting stuff that sound cards can't really do which is where it plays into like more the physics
[5515.80 --> 5521.64]  of what's going on in the game it can be more dynamic so it's i don't necessarily think it will
[5521.64 --> 5527.00]  uh see a huge part of the problem again we're talking about stuff that's not like we haven't
[5527.00 --> 5533.40]  touched it yet um we've done that a few times this stream um but uh i don't necessarily think that it
[5533.40 --> 5537.66]  will sound better like i don't think the quality of the sound will necessarily be increased but i'm
[5537.66 --> 5545.66]  expecting what you hear to be more accurate not not i was gonna say spatial awareness should be much
[5545.66 --> 5551.66]  better yeah but then but then the quality of the sound of the spatial awareness not necessarily
[5551.66 --> 5562.06]  gonna be much better um moving on in the twitter topics no poke today sir uh it's true you avoided it
[5562.06 --> 5567.02]  we have no idea when the 800 series is going to come out the world your dodge dice uh i'm gonna
[5567.02 --> 5571.74]  screw up a little bit why is there so little displayport monitors on the market
[5574.86 --> 5586.06]  oh displayport displayport um i think what really killed displayport was the fact that when hdmi 1.4 came out
[5586.06 --> 5598.46]  and supposedly hdmi 2 is coming yeah soon ish right um i think the the bandwidth on hdmi is getting
[5598.46 --> 5607.02]  enough to where it's hard to justify for like a tv to go to displayport because it's not a standard you
[5607.02 --> 5612.94]  know there's not really like does your tivo need a displayport out on it no right uh does your dvd
[5612.94 --> 5618.94]  player need a displayport out and most of the the panel manufacturers now are also tv manufacturers
[5619.82 --> 5625.82]  yeah so you tend to see most monitors anymore have an hdmi connection and a dvi connection right
[5627.26 --> 5636.14]  yeah so i think it's just a cost thing um it's i know why well i was gonna say the reason that video
[5636.14 --> 5642.62]  cards come with dvi connections is they're smaller than than um our dvi uh displayport connections is
[5642.62 --> 5648.62]  they're smaller than dvi so if you want to fit four uh connections on the back of a video card
[5648.62 --> 5653.58]  you're never going to do it with four dvi connections so they had to go to a standard
[5653.58 --> 5657.26]  right they had to go to a standard that's smaller but that you could put an adapter on
[5658.14 --> 5664.70]  that can go from you know displayport to dvi and not have to worry about you know not being able to do
[5664.70 --> 5671.50]  like 1440. yeah and like you brought up a lot of the manufacturers for monitors are also making tvs so
[5671.50 --> 5679.74]  that's a really good really big point um but to kind of play devil's advocate displayport's not super
[5679.74 --> 5685.82]  strong right now um i use it but it's not very common um i like it a lot actually i love the
[5685.82 --> 5693.74]  connector the connector is so solid but you're starting to see it um a little bit more like the 279q
[5693.74 --> 5702.70]  pa279q from um asus beast monitor that we have downstairs we should be running that on displayport
[5702.70 --> 5709.42]  um and then the new nvidia thing what is it qsync it's called qsync right yeah gsync gsync sorry that
[5709.42 --> 5715.74]  i believe has to be run over displayport yep yeah so so i thought that's what they said yeah i'm pretty
[5715.74 --> 5720.70]  sure that's what they said i don't fully remember but it's very new news um but i'm pretty sure that's
[5720.70 --> 5727.10]  that's what they said so displayport is a thing and will hopefully keep growing because i love it
[5727.10 --> 5733.50]  but it's it's definitely not too big of a thing i will say uh anybody that uses has something with a
[5733.50 --> 5740.06]  mini hdmi port on it like every time i have to plug in an external monitor to my asus ultrabook
[5740.62 --> 5747.82]  i want to kill myself because it's a mini hdmi and not a mini dvi or displayport excuse me um because
[5747.82 --> 5752.78]  the mini displayport when you plug it in it locks right yeah and you can't you know it like stays
[5752.78 --> 5758.14]  solidly seated the hdmi you plug it in it's just like i lose my connection if i like you know if you
[5758.14 --> 5765.26]  move it all my laptop you know a eighth of an inch you know so the connector is the big thing for me i
[5765.26 --> 5771.34]  wish that you know i mean personally my personal feelings is i wish hdmi would just die um and we
[5771.34 --> 5777.02]  could all go to displayport so that we got actual connectors that locked in it's aggressive but i agree you know
[5777.02 --> 5782.46]  what sometimes you gotta take a stance yeah just kill it off bring it out to the field give it to
[5782.46 --> 5789.58]  the farmer um office space or am i showing my age office space office space take the photocopier out
[5789.58 --> 5799.90]  play some good rap music yeah wear some crappy ties and yeah beat it up um opinions on the hdc1 max
[5799.90 --> 5808.70]  what do you think so i i will admit that i am very new to any android devices at all
[5810.22 --> 5817.82]  i actually i know my main phone is actually an apple 4s just because um i'm not out of contract
[5817.82 --> 5824.46]  yet and i can't buy it no no the note 3 i was like i went i actually went into the store the other
[5824.46 --> 5828.78]  day i'm like oh when does my contract come up because i have to buy a note 3 note 3s they were
[5828.78 --> 5835.74]  like oh four months and i'm like no no they'll usually let you out a month early for free just to get
[5835.74 --> 5842.86]  you back yeah so maybe three but so the only the actual only android device i own is my tablet
[5842.86 --> 5849.42]  right okay we can move on from that i'm excited for the hdc1 max i think the hdc1 is a great phone
[5849.42 --> 5854.86]  i think i've always liked hdc personally and i really think with the one series uh they're really
[5854.86 --> 5859.66]  hitting their stride and i'm excited for it there's my little answer i love phones that's that's that's
[5859.66 --> 5864.86]  one thing i'm definitely into but timmy you were saying you want to wait for the note 3 man i i think
[5864.86 --> 5872.30]  the note 3 is going to be possibly the best phone the planet has seen and could be that for a while
[5872.30 --> 5876.86]  i literally has ever seen and obviously kate because it's the newest phone right it gives
[5876.86 --> 5881.34]  a big advantage but they've really they really improved on some things the note 2 was a solid
[5881.34 --> 5885.90]  phone but i really think they improved on quite a few things well obviously i have to see once it's
[5885.90 --> 5890.94]  circulated and use how it goes um but just because it's big you know the battery life is incredible
[5890.94 --> 5896.94]  the s pen features are great so pretty excited yeah no i i played with one and i love the thing so
[5896.94 --> 5901.98]  mm-hmm yeah uh moving on one quick thing that i'm going to cover really quickly and then we'll jump right
[5901.98 --> 5906.86]  off is 215 bucks a good deal for a pair dynamic custom bear dynamic custom one pros i got these
[5906.86 --> 5912.94]  for cheaper i don't know but mine were cheaper so i don't think it's that spectacular moving on to
[5912.94 --> 5918.78]  one that i forgot to put in the wan show doc but i had seen this mike underscore underscore f thank you
[5918.78 --> 5925.50]  for reminding me halo 3 free to play on xbox gold that has become a thing uh i think it was bungee
[5925.50 --> 5930.78]  tweeted about it really it's that's actually like that's pretty cool that's pretty cool you know
[5930.78 --> 5934.70]  mr mike double score f tweets a lot actually it's got a lot of good stuff but that's really that's
[5934.70 --> 5941.02]  that's really interesting halo 2 was the glory days for halo with me yeah me too but that's awesome
[5941.02 --> 5946.38]  that's a really that's just random really cool yeah so if you have an xbox and you have
[5947.26 --> 5951.98]  xbox gold you feel like playing some halo 3 you'll grab some halo 3 it's free so that's
[5951.98 --> 5959.10]  actually the other thing too i mean keep in mind that destiny is coming yep yep and halo 3 was the
[5959.10 --> 5964.70]  last halo game that bungie studios made actually yeah that makes so much i didn't think about the
[5964.70 --> 5968.54]  destiny's coming thing that makes so much more sense watch the trailer for that today it's like
[5968.54 --> 5973.98]  it's like hey we're still here don't forget about us we made this game that you guys liked
[5973.98 --> 5977.90]  yeah a little bit nostalgia go play it for a little bit so you remember us yeah you buy this
[5977.90 --> 5984.86]  new game bungie's a great studio i'm really excited um dongers will not be raised tonight i'm gonna fly
[5984.86 --> 5993.66]  by that uh timmy i'm looking at i'm i'm looking hard at the evga hadron air any thoughts input or
[5993.66 --> 6002.38]  updates would be awesome i'm excited actually i actually have one um which i've completely dismantled we don't
[6002.38 --> 6008.46]  uh yeah i can send you mine but it's uh i took all the rivets out of it and took it apart um
[6009.42 --> 6015.90]  so i'm actually sending it to get sandblasted and repainted i like it so much oh the only thing
[6015.90 --> 6020.22]  yeah the only thing i'm really really i'm kind of like linus with cases sometimes which is like
[6020.78 --> 6027.18]  it doesn't have to be the prettiest thing in the world but it really has to like be consistent so there
[6027.18 --> 6032.30]  is some spots on it that like on the interior of the case is painted black but some spots aren't
[6032.30 --> 6039.98]  because in the next version that's coming out of the hadron there's a water reservoir there oh so
[6041.18 --> 6050.46]  um because there is a a hadron water one coming there's some photos out there on it um but the only
[6050.46 --> 6057.74]  the only thing that really scares me about it is is the airflow there's no filters on the case anywhere
[6058.94 --> 6064.22]  um so it's just going to be a dust magnet which is why i actually took it all apart so that i can put
[6064.22 --> 6073.74]  some some fine mesh in it um and i'm also going to add a little bit of uh like a fan to the front so
[6073.74 --> 6079.66]  it has two exhaust fans on the top uh which you could flip around and make intake fans if you wanted
[6079.66 --> 6084.38]  to uh which is actually what i would recommend because you could flip them around make them intake
[6084.38 --> 6090.38]  fans even though it's not optimal uh and then put uh get like you know a mesh filter put on top of
[6090.38 --> 6095.74]  them and then put the the top back on it yeah and then at least you would have some kind of protection
[6095.74 --> 6101.66]  and you you would uh at that point you would have you know a pressure in the case that would push out
[6101.66 --> 6106.46]  all of the you know normally quote-unquote intake holes and so it wouldn't be as dusty
[6107.18 --> 6114.70]  um but i think to be honest with you even with its shortfalls uh it's one of my favorite itx cases
[6114.70 --> 6120.78]  i've ever seen you should probably post that build log once he's done on the uh yeah yeah no it's up
[6120.78 --> 6126.06]  there nice it's like it's like hadron tear down or something i had a feeling i had maybe seen it
[6126.06 --> 6131.58]  before but i wasn't entirely sure but that's all but it is it is like the perfect size
[6131.58 --> 6138.46]  for an itx case well that's that's really interesting because um speaking of like steam
[6138.46 --> 6142.62]  machines and all that kind of stuff coming out now yeah um i've been talking to you a little
[6142.62 --> 6146.38]  bit about how i'm thinking about doing a build refresh what i want to do my build refresh for
[6146.38 --> 6151.90]  is haswell e okay so i get ddr4 haswell e and then i'm going to aim around because i'm aiming for that
[6151.90 --> 6156.70]  i'm probably going to be going in on maxwell but then i don't know maybe amd will have some answer
[6156.70 --> 6161.18]  at that point in time or maxwell won't be that impressive then i'll get a 290x we'll we'll see
[6161.18 --> 6165.82]  how it goes but i'm waiting for haswell e so whatever graphics card is winning at that point
[6165.82 --> 6172.14]  in time i'll go with that um but that means i'm probably retiring my 2600k yeah because i'm moving
[6172.14 --> 6177.58]  to 2011. now what i want to do is take a 2600k go itx and build a steam machine out of it because i'm
[6177.58 --> 6182.46]  so not done with that processor i love that processor so that would be cool the hadron case
[6182.46 --> 6190.54]  well because i wasn't sold on a case yet yeah just it's it's the the air the filtering is the
[6190.54 --> 6197.74]  the only real issue i have with it um it's actually it's pretty slick little case and it mods really
[6197.74 --> 6203.90]  easy i mean you can like if you just wanted to say take out the drive cage and you know velcro in some
[6203.90 --> 6209.02]  ssds or something you know there's a few rivets you have to drill out but they're all aluminum
[6209.02 --> 6214.06]  yeah it goes fast and that's probably what i would do to be honest because um especially with
[6214.06 --> 6218.94]  the steam machine implementation i'll have all my big games stored on my main computer and i'll just
[6218.94 --> 6224.06]  stream them from my main computer so i won't need a lot of storage so i'll just have a a smaller it
[6224.06 --> 6228.54]  doesn't even have to be that big especially with linux smaller ssd and that's probably all i'll run
[6230.06 --> 6236.22]  yeah and this is i would say you know if people are familiar with the fractal 304 the node 304
[6236.22 --> 6242.70]  uh if it's if you lay the the hadron on its side it's wider but it's not as tall
[6244.30 --> 6250.94]  so it depends on you know where you're going to use it i guess because i really like the node the
[6250.94 --> 6257.74]  node 304 as well yeah but it has the same problem it has no airflow right i mean that's some but not
[6257.74 --> 6264.86]  much yeah definitely um and just all this stuff with itx getting big right now it's it's awesome that
[6264.86 --> 6268.38]  they're getting into the market and i think it was smart for them to start with this case
[6269.18 --> 6273.90]  i think that was really smart because of all the i text stuff going on right now it's just brilliant
[6279.02 --> 6281.58]  give me one second i'm just going to find another tweet for us to go over
[6282.62 --> 6289.50]  um timmy remind people where they can find you uh yeah what's your twitter handle oh yes so twitter
[6289.50 --> 6298.46]  is at detect tv and uh yes the the youtubes is uh youtube.com forward slash timmy tech
[6300.86 --> 6305.90]  and so so you just call it his twitter and his youtube right so one thing i've noticed about
[6305.90 --> 6309.82]  timmy's twitter is that he actually replies to everything i tried to do that as much as i
[6309.82 --> 6313.90]  possibly could when i first started my twitter but it's a little bit insane right now so if you
[6313.90 --> 6317.50]  can i can i jump in on that yeah sorry no no finish your point finish your point i apologize
[6319.82 --> 6324.54]  i can't now because because of the last show i went on i almost doubled followers i went up to 500
[6324.54 --> 6329.26]  something which is awesome and i had a bunch of tweets saying like you did well and you you know
[6329.26 --> 6334.14]  and i want to reply to all of them but i'm a little torn i see every single one of them i favorite most of
[6334.14 --> 6338.70]  them i'm torn because i don't want to reply to every single one and say thank you and then the next
[6338.70 --> 6342.22]  guy going to his twitter and he has to go through coldest sea saying thank you 20 times
[6342.22 --> 6346.62]  right but i do try to reply it's a it's an interesting balance act and i kind of want to
[6346.62 --> 6350.86]  ask timmy how he does balance it because i absolutely appreciate everyone who follows me
[6350.86 --> 6357.02]  and if you tweet at me i see it 100 you know what i mean i don't i don't have the 16 000 that you do
[6357.02 --> 6361.10]  you know what i mean and i still look at all of them i just don't necessarily reply a favorite i look
[6361.10 --> 6365.58]  at every single tweet that's sent to me yeah it's just yeah i wasn't trying to say you just you just
[6365.58 --> 6372.14]  discard them um so i'm the same way i read them all for sure um i try to reply to a lot of them
[6372.14 --> 6375.74]  i was so excited today i was like gonna be on the wancho gonna be the wancho gonna be the wancho
[6375.74 --> 6382.46]  and somebody was finally like okay we get it it's like um but you know this is where i was actually
[6382.46 --> 6389.66]  told somebody today i wish um that you instead you know there's like the private feature but i wish you
[6389.66 --> 6395.90]  could direct tweets at you know so you could say like don't show this in everybody's yeah but if they
[6395.90 --> 6401.42]  come look at me you know if they if they come look at my my you know personal page they would
[6401.42 --> 6408.78]  see it but don't broadcast it to their yeah personal page right their their feed but let me reply to the
[6408.78 --> 6413.82]  person that just asked me that would be awesome sometimes i would freely respond so much more
[6413.82 --> 6418.22]  it's one of the reasons why i stopped replying to everyone because what i would do is i'd work all day
[6418.22 --> 6423.74]  and not check my twitter and then after work i'd sit down on my personal computer and reply to 200 people
[6423.74 --> 6428.38]  but then you're just gonna spam everybody and i got tons of complaints so i was like i don't want
[6428.38 --> 6433.10]  to lose followers by saying thanks like in 30 tweets and guys like well i'm not following this dude
[6433.10 --> 6438.86]  anymore yeah yeah as timmy said as he described it twitter implemented that i honestly feel like
[6438.86 --> 6442.94]  because saying thank you takes two seconds to someone who's following you and sending you a tweet
[6442.94 --> 6447.02]  and if if you could just direct it at them like he said and not you know that would be awesome
[6447.02 --> 6451.42]  twitter needs to implement that i really think that would be and not just for us three
[6451.42 --> 6456.62]  no for everyone i feel like there'd be a lot more interaction if if you could manage it that
[6456.62 --> 6462.06]  way you know not broadcast um i just wonder if i wonder if they don't do that because of their
[6462.06 --> 6468.22]  whole trending idea hmm they're probably trying yeah but let it trend that's a good point
[6468.22 --> 6475.34]  let twitter see it yeah right just just don't put it in people's feeds i don't care if twitter
[6475.34 --> 6479.74]  sees what i said it can even show up under the trend doesn't bother me yeah it could still trend
[6479.74 --> 6485.98]  up under right or even if even if somebody searched for like you know timmy tech tv and all my replies
[6485.98 --> 6491.34]  came up that would be okay i just don't want to pollute people's feed exactly yeah because you go to
[6491.34 --> 6495.42]  the you go to the home tab you check out your feed and it's just all one dude because i i used to feel
[6495.42 --> 6499.74]  bad because i'd look at my home tab and then i'd respond to 200 people and then i'd look at my home
[6499.74 --> 6504.30]  tab again i'm like oh it's a whole bunch of yeah and you want at the same time you want to make them
[6504.30 --> 6508.78]  feel appreciated and you don't want to spam the crap out of stuff because i don't like that i have i
[6508.78 --> 6512.70]  have followed people in the past that i've met in real life and unfollowed them a week later because
[6512.70 --> 6518.62]  when i go on twitter i don't want 40 of your updates yeah on my screen exactly exactly how timmy
[6518.62 --> 6524.46]  described it i could not agree more i i would love to i'd love to echo your opinion there i'm gonna jump
[6524.46 --> 6530.22]  off the twitter blitz for a sec here and i'm going to jump to a topic that i'm gonna try to keep my
[6530.22 --> 6534.86]  anger contained as much as i possibly can for i know this man's going to have some trouble with it
[6535.50 --> 6540.54]  actually hang on one sec somebody just replied that said it only broadcasts to feeds if someone
[6540.54 --> 6551.10]  is following the person you replied to that's interesting so if i retweet if i reply back to t
[6551.10 --> 6555.74]  i shouldn't pick this guy's name because i'm gonna say that'll reply to me so everyone that's
[6555.74 --> 6559.90]  following me will also get that because i was i was just wondering in how he said that because
[6559.90 --> 6566.14]  because you're replying to both right so i think when everyone messages linus and myself if i respond
[6566.14 --> 6571.42]  i think everyone following and the people mentioned you only see twitter replies in your main feed if you
[6571.42 --> 6576.78]  follow the original person and the people mentioned so if i replied and the people mentioned
[6576.78 --> 6583.74]  i think it's or that people mentioned sometime well i don't know interesting we'll have to i'll
[6583.74 --> 6587.18]  have to play around with that we can all tweet each other later and we're gonna have to figure i would
[6587.18 --> 6592.46]  love to figure this out because i don't have that well i do don't don't get me wrong i i have a bunch
[6592.86 --> 6597.50]  but relatively i don't have a ton and i would love to reply to all these guys yeah it would be interesting
[6597.50 --> 6603.42]  to see like so when you say reply right yeah but like say this this twitter blitz if i reply to somebody
[6603.42 --> 6610.54]  and i'm just gonna pick somebody at random here if i delete your guys's twitter handles i wonder
[6610.54 --> 6616.94]  what happens yeah try it because i follow you so i should be able to you should be able to tweet it
[6616.94 --> 6622.38]  and once it's up i can tell you if i see it or not it would be good to know because it would make me uh
[6623.82 --> 6628.70]  less afraid to reply to everybody absolutely this is a sorry guys for dealing with us but this is all
[6628.70 --> 6633.74]  something we're discovering it does not i follow timmy tech i follow timmy tech it did not just come
[6633.74 --> 6638.70]  up in my home feed and i went to his page and i saw it so that must work i used to get complaints
[6638.70 --> 6643.34]  maybe they changed something i don't know yeah that's really cool we're awesome virtual high five
[6643.34 --> 6648.78]  to timmy we figured yeah well virtual high five to whoever pointed that out in the a joy absolutely
[6648.78 --> 6655.02]  let's you know what i think a couple people did uh alec joy absolutely did big shout out to that man
[6655.02 --> 6665.90]  um that's cool um t and he's a radio guy a couple guys team red baby yeah he's got it in his logo
[6666.54 --> 6672.94]  oh he's a usc fan that looks it as well let's uh let's move on to the next topic this guy's awesome
[6672.94 --> 6677.90]  this alec joy guy he's getting some uh let's let's follow that man right there okay let's move on to the
[6677.90 --> 6683.34]  next topic uh this one is the league of legends player that posted nudes of his girlfriend online
[6683.82 --> 6693.50]  um and then blamed her effectively so what happened was he quote hacked unquote into her account he
[6693.50 --> 6698.54]  probably just knowing the password and typing it in is not hacking so many people say that
[6698.54 --> 6705.82]  but like i mean he probably just knew the password um anyways using i forgot my password and logging into
[6705.82 --> 6711.42]  their email and doing it that way is also not hacking yeah sorry he probably didn't actually
[6711.42 --> 6717.10]  hack it anyways he went into her league of legends account and lost five games she's quite intensely
[6717.10 --> 6722.38]  into the game so that is actually quite a big deal because i believe these were ranked games um sometime
[6722.38 --> 6728.70]  later very likely unrelated even though it doesn't freaking matter she went and played the league of
[6728.70 --> 6736.94]  legends character lee sin playing a character in a game oh no that's horrible a character in a game
[6737.66 --> 6743.50]  anyways his response was that he was so enraged that he posted nude pictures of her that were shared
[6743.50 --> 6747.82]  only with him on his facebook page which is a public facebook page and he is a figure in the league
[6747.82 --> 6754.38]  of legends community so a lot of people saw it he left them up for three days i believe he left them up for
[6754.38 --> 6759.26]  three days until a fellow league of legends player and i believe past starcraft player same person
[6759.26 --> 6765.02]  correct destiny yes yeah past starcraft player current league of legends player he's not really a pro
[6765.02 --> 6770.78]  he's more of a personality personality either way threatened to release his personal information online
[6770.78 --> 6777.10]  so out of fear for his personal information being released he took down his girlfriend's nudes
[6777.10 --> 6784.38]  which is way more important what the hell so so when i saw you link this thing i had to go read about
[6784.38 --> 6790.46]  it because i was like chuckling to myself so the first funny thing is like i went to his facebook page
[6790.46 --> 6795.66]  and just kind of looked through this stuff real quick uh first of all if you do some background on
[6795.66 --> 6803.02]  this guy he's like highly regarded as one of the best non-pro players yeah out there right um the
[6803.02 --> 6808.94]  other thing you notice is the guy is kind of psycho um and a lot of people said that the girlfriend
[6808.94 --> 6814.30]  quote unquote that he'd been dating her you know not very long let's just say um
[6815.98 --> 6819.26]  so it you know this is one of the problems where
[6822.22 --> 6827.66]  people play so many video games i i think just forget what real life consequences are yeah
[6827.66 --> 6835.50]  no they take everything in the game so personally um you know it's like your girlfriend breaks up with
[6835.50 --> 6840.94]  you you uh you know if you're a guy you go to a strip club or get drunk or you know hang out hang
[6840.94 --> 6845.26]  out with the guys and me at max level in an mmo you know whatever incredible
[6849.26 --> 6856.94]  yeah play play 40 hours of of skyrim straight um but but you know you you you kind of recede and then
[6856.94 --> 6864.54]  you know get over it and and then you come on to the next yeah yeah um yeah i don't you know
[6865.58 --> 6872.06]  i think bad move the the thing i read uh on one of the articles about that today was uh that they've
[6872.06 --> 6878.54]  actually banned him from league of legends and from and from twitch and from twitch yeah so he kind of got
[6879.10 --> 6884.22]  decimated by two companies that i respect a lot more for this one thing that was posted august 10th
[6884.22 --> 6887.82]  this is this this story has been around for a bit if some people are wondering why we're just
[6887.82 --> 6892.46]  covering it now the story has been around for a bit but the information has been kind of uh
[6892.46 --> 6898.46]  scatterbrained and we didn't really cover it now because it was just so messed up and i was so
[6898.46 --> 6903.82]  unsure about so many things but on the 10th he posted some youtube videos to something and i think it's
[6903.82 --> 6908.94]  a song yeah and he quotes i'm gonna feel bad saying all this i'm gonna talk about it afterwards
[6908.94 --> 6915.18]  it's sad what society turns my long loving girlfriend into what i can't save her it's up
[6915.18 --> 6923.10]  to her to save herself okay she chose being a monster that just wants to hurt people from a
[6923.10 --> 6927.82]  loving caring girl what a shame all because of four pictures that didn't really become viral
[6928.38 --> 6934.62]  hell this hurts to say it hurts my brain until she made it viral herself and i only did it because she
[6934.62 --> 6940.22]  ignored me for three to four days and was doing things similar to what she's doing now i do not
[6940.22 --> 6945.18]  feel anything except bad for her because she doesn't realize how bad the things she is doing
[6945.18 --> 6951.10]  is compared to the one little thing that i did two of the most important things in life is knowing what
[6951.10 --> 6956.94]  forgiveness and sacrifice is sadly she hasn't learned those two words what those two words mean yet i'll
[6956.94 --> 6962.38]  teach him i will be waiting for her i feel a lot of people want to teach him a lot of things in physical
[6962.38 --> 6970.62]  ways with fists um but well the other thing is he has like he has like 12 000 followers on his page
[6970.62 --> 6976.14]  did he not think that nude pictures were going to go viral and i don't think it was her it's it's okay
[6976.78 --> 6984.22]  sarah is the girl's name and sarah you're not watching this but like it's not your fault you're not a
[6984.22 --> 6990.06]  monster get a restraining order and run like i'm sure she's already running because he's saying that
[6990.06 --> 6994.94]  she's ignoring him that's good keep running and run faster because this is not your fault and this
[6994.94 --> 7000.14]  guy's nuts like you don't need come hang out with us he won't get through the door yeah it'll be all
[7000.14 --> 7008.46]  right just like oh oh it's just a really unfortunate unfortunate story and uh there's so many
[7009.98 --> 7014.94]  one thing this is i'm gonna try and add some comedy to this because it's mad he ruined it for so many
[7014.94 --> 7021.34]  dudes a lot of girls are gonna read this and then that's not gonna happen anymore i was just gonna
[7021.34 --> 7025.82]  make a comment about how please girl gamers don't think that this one jack
[7028.94 --> 7032.78]  just like because i mean i have why i have a daughter right i mean i don't want
[7033.74 --> 7038.78]  my daughter to have to deal with this kind of cup when she grows up right i watched how men and boys
[7038.78 --> 7044.46]  talk to girls this is like a kind of a tangent off of this but you know i watch how these you know
[7044.46 --> 7050.46]  jerks talk to girls and it makes me wonder like where were their mom and dad to teach them proper
[7050.46 --> 7055.66]  manners when a lady's around honestly you know and i sound like an old curmudgeon now at this point i'm
[7055.66 --> 7060.86]  gonna sound like an old curmudgeon but my belief is the majority of the time those two people the
[7060.86 --> 7064.38]  mom and dad weren't in the picture i can tell you luke doesn't talk to girls like that i can guarantee
[7064.38 --> 7071.90]  you he doesn't i i don't it you know it's unfortunately it's because you know of that honestly because they they
[7071.90 --> 7076.86]  don't have an excellent father figure like i'm sure you are it's it's just it's just a sad fact
[7076.86 --> 7080.86]  and it's really too bad that there's so many league of legends is so huge and there seems like there's
[7080.86 --> 7087.02]  so many sub pros or b pros or we want to call them that drama and like the guy raising funds and was in
[7087.02 --> 7092.46]  a wheelchair who stood up during his stream and walked away and there's just there's just other
[7092.46 --> 7098.78]  ugly stories that that's very saturated it's really depressing when we're on this exceptional
[7098.78 --> 7104.94]  growth for the last two years let's say um of esports it's really sad that these things come in
[7104.94 --> 7109.74]  and really just knock us back a couple steps you know yeah well and i feel like a lot of these you
[7109.74 --> 7115.90]  know but let's be honest most of the people that are in esports i'm you know i'm generalizing here
[7115.90 --> 7122.38]  vastly but most of the people that are you know in esports didn't play other sports right and
[7122.38 --> 7127.90]  you know like playing little league and playing high school football like you learn to lose
[7128.70 --> 7134.70]  you learn to hate it but you learned how to be a good sportsman and you learn how not to lose next
[7134.70 --> 7140.06]  time and how to be on a team right right and how to be on a team and i think you know a lot of these
[7140.06 --> 7144.38]  things with you know like these league of legends especially like if you don't know the people you're
[7144.38 --> 7150.14]  playing with you can be a dirt because you're like whatever i'll just find other people to play with
[7150.14 --> 7155.18]  and you know you know screw you guys and you know all this stuff but you know i've never
[7155.90 --> 7160.06]  you know even like in all the time i was playing wow and you know you deal with the pugs and
[7160.70 --> 7164.22]  you know this problem's been around a lot longer than i think it's been getting attention
[7165.18 --> 7170.86]  um you know if somebody's not good try to help them be better instead of berating them
[7172.14 --> 7176.94]  that's something that's kind of can i probably not gonna i want to jet in there for a second you
[7176.94 --> 7180.78]  guys probably noticed last time we were together you were in my fire shirt i do it's called pay
[7180.78 --> 7184.94]  call it's basically voluntary won't get into the details of the difference um i had an interview
[7184.94 --> 7191.26]  for a promotion that ended up receiving which was cool but i had a question that was who are the three
[7191.26 --> 7198.14]  most unskilled firefighters in your hall i've got a chief and a captain sitting there asking me this
[7198.14 --> 7202.14]  that's an extremely difficult question and i won't even get into what i answered but the follow-up
[7202.14 --> 7207.10]  question timmy just to it what you said made me think of it was how have you helped them improved
[7207.82 --> 7214.30]  improve yeah mentoring is a big deal you know where i work too it's huge and that's you know how how
[7214.30 --> 7219.18]  people grow in their careers where i work part of it is mentoring people that their skills aren't as
[7219.18 --> 7224.62]  good as yours and part of it is being mentored by somebody that has better skills than you being able
[7224.62 --> 7229.02]  to be able to take right and you have to be able to take the other part of it too is you know you
[7229.02 --> 7233.50]  have to learn to be able to take feedback from people that are trying to be nice and not be a
[7233.50 --> 7238.78]  jerk back because i see that sometimes too where you know somebody will be like hey uh if you did
[7238.78 --> 7243.26]  this differently maybe it would help you and then the person's like well i know what i'm doing you
[7243.26 --> 7247.66]  don't know anything right so you have to be able to listen to people too and say like hey that's a
[7247.66 --> 7254.78]  great idea maybe i'll try that next time yeah absolutely yeah like uh and something else in here where
[7254.78 --> 7262.94]  is it the confront the confrontation between i think destiny and xj9 was recorded on wednesday
[7262.94 --> 7268.06]  i don't remember where you can find it but you can find it um you can hear xj9 trying to justify why
[7268.06 --> 7276.46]  he released the videos at it's it's like a while in i believe and apparently he says we literally said to
[7276.46 --> 7283.58]  each other if i really hated you the worst thing uh you could do is play lee sin and that's what she did
[7283.58 --> 7291.82]  oh no she probably didn't take that sentence in the same way you did even if you did it probably
[7291.82 --> 7297.58]  wasn't actually the worst thing and just because someone does something bad to you doesn't mean you
[7297.58 --> 7304.46]  need to do it back yeah so really i mean i'm a really depressing story well most men have probably
[7304.46 --> 7310.78]  had a breakup where it ends in i hate you i never want to talk to you again i'm just gonna throw that out
[7310.78 --> 7320.78]  there yeah so you know i really find the whole story like if i was that guy's dad or would i just
[7320.78 --> 7325.18]  be like smacking him upside the head it's like oh my goodness there would be problems but again that's
[7325.18 --> 7329.58]  the issue i'm willing to bet the dad's not in the picture at least not one like we have or like you
[7329.58 --> 7334.78]  are you know that's we we kind of reiterate it here but that i believe that that's the source of a lot
[7334.78 --> 7344.46]  of issues i have twins i have a boy and a girl so that'll be interesting someday when uh well it's
[7344.46 --> 7348.30]  funny because they they hit each other because they're two and they don't know what they're doing
[7350.46 --> 7355.02]  my daughter daughter pushed down my son and my son got back up and pushed down my daughter
[7355.02 --> 7358.78]  and i was like you know first i was like you know i told my daughter that that's not the right way to
[7358.78 --> 7362.78]  behave but then i took my son aside and i was like listen buddy you're gonna get hit by girls in
[7362.78 --> 7367.66]  life and it's gonna suck but you do not touch them right and he's like two and a half and he's
[7367.66 --> 7374.70]  like okay dad i don't understand yeah i'm graining that in early though because you know you treat
[7374.70 --> 7380.38]  women with respect i know it may be sexist but i don't care it's the way that i'm gonna raise my
[7380.38 --> 7386.06]  kids in the way that i was raised by my parents so all right now something that i've been stalling
[7386.06 --> 7391.98]  for for a little bit actually that we finally got to is we have build logs of the week and i don't
[7391.98 --> 7401.66]  think whaler's a yep click it okay um hopefully we can get that approved what wasn't me linus just
[7401.66 --> 7408.62]  messaged me what question mark wasn't me i have no idea what he's talking about at all nobody does
[7408.62 --> 7413.90]  nobody does crazy one sec i'm gonna i have to i have to share the document which i'm not even entirely
[7413.90 --> 7420.30]  sure how to do uh sharing settings there we go we got build logs of the week coming just there was
[7420.30 --> 7426.22]  some problems with the document two seconds guys there we go yes i'm sure i clicked it three times
[7427.50 --> 7431.18]  okay you're shared on there now no you should download it and then full screen it from do
[7431.18 --> 7438.86]  you have powerpoint on there i doubt it sorry snap this is a oh no i do i do yeah i saw that
[7438.86 --> 7442.22]  good okay download it 2013 so there
[7442.22 --> 7449.90]  we're gonna get into build logs of the week and then we will jump into the after party which will
[7449.90 --> 7458.38]  be obviously after so probably slideshow and then from beginning and then we'll switch to yours
[7459.26 --> 7463.90]  man i used to use powerpoint constantly in school it's been uh i use it quite often
[7463.90 --> 7471.02]  is this the new way we do things oh i see there we go all right give me one second so this first one
[7473.74 --> 7478.30]  apparently there's a slight update but we're gonna go with this one because it's been too delayed
[7478.30 --> 7484.62]  so the first one build logs go nice one is the nautilus reactor by lock alpha
[7484.62 --> 7494.06]  how cool is that this thing that is insane like i don't even know where to start that is that is
[7494.06 --> 7497.50]  so cool do we have the name of the guy who made this on the forum yeah go back
[7500.14 --> 7506.22]  lock alpha lock alpha props that's how he pronounces it that is an incredibly good looking machine
[7506.22 --> 7510.46]  submerged in oil looks absolutely incredible the attention to detail is just
[7510.46 --> 7518.46]  mind-blowing totally mind-blowing nuts it's wall mounted which is just cool because why not um this
[7518.46 --> 7521.50]  is definitely one of those things that's not a floor people these are vertical
[7522.06 --> 7526.22]  board this is wall mounted yes it's one look at the cd that's so cool it's nuts
[7527.26 --> 7533.10]  i know it's it looks really good that's incredible oh the cd even has a curve oh my goodness yeah
[7533.10 --> 7537.02]  yeah the like you have you guys you have to go see this on the forum
[7537.02 --> 7543.82]  like i know i see that every week does that look like jeez i love the the three light bulbs on it
[7543.82 --> 7549.18]  probably take more power than the whole rest of the machine because of yeah yeah because of its
[7549.18 --> 7552.94]  four-factor because of those light bulbs and everything yeah it's actually wouldn't even be
[7552.94 --> 7559.90]  that surprised uh i'll give you one that is awesome why is the chat hidden have you guys seen that uh
[7559.90 --> 7564.38]  i think it was in thailand where a guy puts water in a two liter bottle and a little bit of bleach
[7564.38 --> 7569.98]  and uh takes the light in makes the equivalent of a 500 watt light bulb you can barely look right
[7569.98 --> 7577.18]  at it and it lasts for weeks that's so that's weird sorry anyways are you uh um the the tubes in
[7577.18 --> 7582.78]  there are actually flowing uh which is actually pretty insane this coiled copper tube yep wow i saw
[7582.78 --> 7588.14]  that part of the build log he was filling it um it's just uh i don't even know what else to say
[7588.14 --> 7594.70]  about it i might get something mixed up so please go check out um that build log that's just
[7594.70 --> 7602.78]  absolutely insane and go next so now we're getting to titanium s by paul tan he has made it in our build
[7602.78 --> 7607.50]  logs of the week before actually paul tan is a little bit active on our forum which is nice so we
[7607.50 --> 7615.02]  jump into the next and just oh man this beautiful yellow are you recognizing things yeah that's a cosmos
[7615.02 --> 7619.50]  too right there yep it's actually pretty cool and it looks you can see the fan through the
[7619.50 --> 7623.90]  fun which is quite interesting if you jump forward again sorry one second i gotta look at this monitor
[7623.90 --> 7631.66]  real quick that's incredible i like how he did edit the uh the slide panel there in the front and i
[7631.66 --> 7636.30]  believe that is a fan intake actually yeah that he put up in the top there really cool
[7637.66 --> 7643.02]  the mobo trays converted 90 degrees which is like my favorite thing about this building you can see
[7643.02 --> 7648.06]  a custom bracket there on the side wow and like just how everything comes in like check out the
[7648.06 --> 7654.46]  power supply like does that look like a natural alignment no just everything in this computer was
[7654.46 --> 7659.58]  just it's kind of ridiculous they took the bars off the top too which means he had to fill in those
[7659.58 --> 7667.10]  holes oh that's interesting this logo is also right it had the cooler master logo here yeah the paint job's
[7667.10 --> 7672.38]  just sick um he also probably could have gotten away with saying um
[7674.30 --> 7679.50]  bumblebee because it reminds me of bumblebee definitely yeah i'm trying to think of the name
[7680.46 --> 7689.42]  ah name of what the movie in that photo i mean yeah the side panel is like there's no window so the
[7689.42 --> 7695.90]  thing that impresses me here is like the massive attention to detail on the inside and then like man i know
[7695.90 --> 7702.70]  i'm cool enough to just put the side panel back on yep definitely um i actually think yeah i think
[7702.70 --> 7707.82]  it is there is a window yeah i think you put in a custom window there on the top yeah yeah oh wow
[7707.82 --> 7713.50]  and it doesn't come with that so and he went to the edge with it which is not easy to do yeah that's
[7713.50 --> 7719.34]  really yeah see that's why i thought it wasn't a window the window in mine my father and i did and we
[7719.34 --> 7724.70]  just we just cut it in uh but it definitely don't go to the edge going to the edge completely changes the
[7724.70 --> 7729.90]  ball oh completely actually going past it's going to be hard to see um and you can't actually see
[7729.90 --> 7734.54]  with my mouse in this view but uh it's hard to describe it basically three quarters towards the
[7734.54 --> 7740.46]  front of the machine there's a bend in the door getting past that with creating a window is incredibly
[7740.46 --> 7744.46]  difficult the fact like he had to completely replace it fabricated himself if you're just
[7744.46 --> 7750.94]  going to cut it out like i did and place plexiglass in behind you cannot go past that bump without
[7750.94 --> 7755.26]  quite a bit of difficulty i know in mine i avoided it i stopped right before it so would not go around
[7755.26 --> 7760.14]  that curve right yeah if we jump forward again one thing wicked i wanted to point out too is the
[7760.78 --> 7768.46]  the piping uh there we go the piping it's just like that's so clean that's so beautifully done
[7768.46 --> 7773.42]  beautifully done uh one thing i noticed with paul tans builds is there about both the builds this
[7773.42 --> 7779.34]  week actually are like art pieces oh absolutely like they're obviously functional but like that last one
[7779.34 --> 7786.38]  one with very bioshocky very like it's submerged but it's submerged all this kind of stuff is like
[7786.94 --> 7794.06]  it's very much art but then this is like moderny like sophisticated lamborghini bumblebee style art so
[7794.06 --> 7799.10]  it's it's nice to be able to see two different degrees of what you can do with art and design while
[7799.10 --> 7807.34]  building a computer instead of like i bought an r4 and clean things and i have a clean r4 with noctuas
[7807.34 --> 7812.06]  and i'm like oh that's badass but like all the peoples have it which is which is cool but it's
[7812.06 --> 7815.34]  nice to be able to differentiate yourself it's really hard to do a build like this like i know i
[7815.34 --> 7821.90]  spent we spent tons of time on my cosmos to build and this one is considerably more intricate someone
[7821.90 --> 7825.74]  someone said in the chat modern art with a question mark i would say modern art but there isn't like
[7825.74 --> 7832.06]  four faces coming out of the front i would say modern art but it's so much better yeah i feel like
[7832.06 --> 7839.74]  that's a degrading comment yeah yeah that's what uh the uh the hadron air i'm doing i'm actually
[7839.74 --> 7846.30]  going to take it to a body shop and have it painted uh like high gloss white inside and out because then
[7846.30 --> 7849.98]  it's like at least you know if you're going to do all this like trouble to take everything apart and
[7849.98 --> 7854.78]  that was where when when linus like re-powder i mean at least he put a wrinkled powder coat on it
[7855.42 --> 7860.54]  but when he really powder coated it i wanted to be like you took it all apart to make it the same color like
[7860.54 --> 7866.22]  like like let's make it like you know a different color of black or something i don't know you know
[7866.78 --> 7871.18]  um make it stand out that because that's what you know like when you do all this work
[7872.22 --> 7876.62]  a lot of people never see this right i mean a lot of people just do it because they like to and
[7877.18 --> 7883.66]  they're gonna see it and you know that's the you know i still have to be losing i still haven't
[7884.22 --> 7890.38]  posted a build log of my now year and a half old yeah cosmos build well it was for me and my friends
[7890.38 --> 7897.10]  and you know it was it was for fun yeah yeah more more and more i mean it seems like you know
[7897.66 --> 7903.42]  engineers are a dying breed right and i think stuff like this where it's like hey you know i'm just
[7903.42 --> 7907.98]  customize a computer case but a lot of time you know when you're talking about you know like hey i
[7907.98 --> 7912.86]  have to make a bracket so that i can add this thing or you know that's engineering people just
[7912.86 --> 7917.90]  don't realize it right because they're doing it for fun um or like you know 3d printing
[7917.90 --> 7923.34]  right like i have a i needed a piece for one of my pc cases and i just went over to a friend's house
[7923.34 --> 7929.18]  and like hey here's a cad rendering of of what i need and and he just printed it out on this 3d
[7929.18 --> 7935.18]  printer and i put it on my case how crazy is that that's awesome so what i will say like
[7935.74 --> 7938.46]  sorry oh go ahead what color are you getting your head drawn in
[7938.46 --> 7946.70]  uh i think i'm gonna do like it's it's not an arctic white but it's um same color white that's
[7946.70 --> 7954.38]  on porsches so it's it's very like a clean white yeah um but it's gonna have a poly finish on it so
[7954.38 --> 7961.42]  it'll be shiny i drive around in vancouver just on the outside so i see porsches constantly and uh i
[7961.42 --> 7966.38]  wouldn't yeah i wouldn't even say it's glossy but it's a very fine white i think i i like the idea that
[7966.38 --> 7971.02]  you described as the porsche white because it's it's actually kind of a different a different
[7971.02 --> 7974.62]  white than a lot of the whites that are out there right now yeah i think they call it snow white
[7975.34 --> 7982.62]  okay the color that i i chose but but we'll see that's i know ha ha ha snow white yeah
[7985.50 --> 7989.18]  all right well we've done the build logs of the week i'm going to do one more quick shout out
[7989.18 --> 7993.66]  uh for the folding and boink teams on the forum if you like the forum if you're on the forum you should
[7993.66 --> 7997.82]  check out folding and boink teams they're both for a good cause you can ask whaler more about
[7997.82 --> 8005.58]  either one our folding team is like kind of insane i think we're still the fastest growing team um in
[8005.58 --> 8010.78]  the world which is just monstrous and awesome and our boink team is doing quite well as well so
[8010.78 --> 8019.58]  definitely check those out and on our way out because he stayed for i believe an hour and 13 minutes
[8019.58 --> 8023.74]  longer than he was supposed to somewhere around there if timmy tech can say goodbye and say where
[8023.74 --> 8031.34]  you can find them then we'll sign right off again uh on twitter at the tech tv and on youtube at youtube.com
