[0.00 → 4.96] There we go. Are we unboxing this? Sorry? Are we unboxing this?
[4.96 → 6.24] I don't know. We might use them.
[7.68 → 12.04] Oh, I left them way over there. My laptop's here, which makes life difficult.
[12.82 → 13.94] My battery's almost dead.
[14.30 → 16.50] Hello, welcome to the after party where we do kind of whatever.
[18.60 → 24.00] Should we launch right into that topic that we teased during the LAN show or should we just like...
[24.00 → 27.54] Should we just like let them stew?
[27.54 → 35.04] What do they think? We have an awesome unboxing from Racer of things that we can use.
[35.20 → 37.30] Yeah, things that we can use to like play games.
[37.40 → 40.32] Or we can explain the other thing. Should we ask what they want?
[40.52 → 40.88] Yeah.
[41.10 → 42.46] Because we have mystery unboxing.
[43.84 → 44.24] Yeah.
[45.74 → 49.14] We've done a lot of Racer unboxing lately. They've had a lot of stuff coming out lately.
[51.14 → 55.10] I was, I've sort of, I don't know.
[55.10 → 57.10] I was, uh...
[57.10 → 60.52] Did you, did you check out the Hammerhead unboxing?
[61.04 → 61.24] No.
[61.64 → 64.34] Okay. Well, basically what I said about it, you know the Hammerhead, right?
[64.42 → 65.82] The, uh, the new earphones.
[66.10 → 73.50] What I said about it was, it's not for me because I'm not a bass head, but if you are a bass head, then there's a good chance you'll like it.
[73.86 → 76.18] Did you, uh, did you get a chance to try them? They're downstairs?
[76.50 → 79.16] No, I don't even like in-ears at all.
[79.28 → 80.34] Okay, okay. Forget it then.
[80.34 → 83.84] Like, especially, they're in-ears, right? Like, they're directly in-ears?
[83.86 → 84.08] Yeah.
[84.30 → 84.50] Yeah.
[84.60 → 85.52] Yeah, they're Items. Okay.
[86.16 → 88.48] Okay, forget it. You didn't mind the Flux in Ear Pros though, right?
[88.52 → 93.64] They went over my ear and hooked in. Everything falls out of my ears. I can't use them. That's why I don't like them.
[93.74 → 94.32] Oh, I see.
[94.32 → 111.52] Like, it's actually physically impossible. I'll like walk around for two minutes, and they're out of my ears. Unless I'm walking around like this the entire time, it doesn't work. So I have to use like those stock old school iPhone ones that can like to hook into your ear. That's, or ones that will go up around my ear like the Steel Face Pros.
[111.52 → 116.42] I see. So did you notice how many more people were tuned in when we had JJ on versus when we didn't?
[116.58 → 118.16] It had started dipping before he left.
[118.40 → 119.44] That's crazy though.
[119.44 → 122.08] Yeah. We were at, I think we peaked at 4,700.
[122.18 → 124.62] 4,700 viewers. I think that might be a new record?
[124.88 → 125.02] Yeah.
[125.38 → 129.04] I think that's a new record. So that was, that was really cool. I thought that was neat.
[129.04 → 139.06] Um, yeah, let's talk, let's talk about ghetto shield. Let's do it. Let's talk about ghetto shield.
[139.40 → 144.24] I'm going to go operate the camera because I want them to get a pretty good look at this, but, uh, yeah.
[144.30 → 153.56] So we didn't get a we didn't get a an Nvidia shield. So we were like, okay, well, we still want a game on our desktop, uh, using a controller and a mobile device.
[153.56 → 154.46] So we're going to make our own.
[154.46 → 169.44] So yeah. Um, I had seen a post by someone, I don't remember his name, unfortunately, where he had made a similar version to this, but the fundamental idea, the thing that mattered, because I didn't copy anything other than the software was, um, Splash top.
[169.60 → 174.16] The software is that it streams your, your, what's going on in your desktop to your phone.
[174.28 → 175.88] That lens is a prime. I can't zoom it in.
[176.14 → 176.60] Oh, okay.
[176.80 → 177.02] Okay.
[177.02 → 183.58] Um, so we took that idea and then my own nerdiness and made this.
[183.58 → 193.46] So what happened was I grabbed an old side panel, an old thick side panel and reeled basically a T out of it, which is like not very well done, but I just wanted to make sure it worked.
[193.54 → 194.24] Yeah. It's kind of terrible.
[194.54 → 195.30] You drew it.
[195.70 → 199.00] That's true. But I also told you at the time that you shouldn't follow those lines.
[199.00 → 207.32] Um, it works surprisingly well and the T ended up not actually mattering at all, which is interesting.
[208.00 → 208.40] Interesting.
[208.60 → 208.96] Jerk.
[209.42 → 220.02] Um, because another stage of it is that we wanted the phone not to be fixed in any way, and we wanted any phone to be able to put in it.
[220.02 → 223.36] So we didn't want a fixed plate back here where you just put your phone in.
[223.88 → 228.02] Um, so we put Velcro on the back of the case, put fuzzy side here so it's not annoying to hold.
[228.22 → 230.82] And then the hooked Velcro side here.
[231.02 → 234.18] So if you Velcro a case, you can put any case you want on here.
[234.18 → 239.00] And because it's just a big T panel, you can position it anywhere on the Velcro you want.
[239.26 → 243.00] So if you have huge fingers, you can position it higher and it won't bug your fingers.
[244.04 → 245.46] Which is actually kind of interesting.
[245.60 → 246.14] Which is very cool.
[246.24 → 253.18] And another option, if you preferred something more like this, is you could buy a cheapo, basically disposable phone case.
[253.18 → 261.84] And if you didn't intend to ever use different phones or whatever else on it, you could have a case that lives here, like this.
[261.96 → 266.50] And then you could just snap a phone into place whenever you actually want to use this.
[266.50 → 274.44] Which gives you a ton of flexibility compared to, uh, you know, an all-in-one device that is only, can only be used one way.
[274.60 → 276.32] So let's get into the app.
[276.56 → 278.42] You, you had a you had a demo running, right?
[278.66 → 281.56] Yeah, it's, it's, it's a little bit rough.
[281.56 → 286.00] It's obviously not the same usability experience that you'll get from something like Shield.
[286.24 → 287.92] But it does kind of work.
[288.06 → 290.28] So what you need is a program called Splash top.
[290.36 → 290.80] It's free.
[290.98 → 293.42] You can get the Splash top Personal on your phone.
[293.58 → 297.02] And you get Splash top Streamer on your desktop.
[297.28 → 298.68] So I want Bulbasaur PC, right?
[298.86 → 299.96] You want Bulbasaur PC.
[300.16 → 304.08] It works wirelessly in much the same way that, uh, NVIDIA Shield does.
[304.38 → 305.92] Oh, sorry, I can't take that call right now.
[306.26 → 309.50] Uh, it works wirelessly in much the same way that NVIDIA Shield does.
[309.50 → 317.06] And, um, so the way we have the Xbox controller working wirelessly is that it's plugged in via a wireless dongle to the PC itself.
[317.18 → 319.26] So your range would be somewhat limited.
[319.52 → 322.08] And, you know, yes, this is a very, very ghetto way to do it.
[322.12 → 327.32] But the way that I would kind of look at this is more like, um, I don't think it's a replacement for Shield.
[327.32 → 330.86] Because Shield is, uh, it has great battery life.
[331.14 → 336.88] It's an actual-dedicated piece of hardware for it that, um, I mean, it's specialized.
[337.24 → 340.60] It doesn't have, like, sharp pieces of metal that are going to poke into you and stuff.
[340.66 → 344.98] But this would be a neat way to find out if you think you'll actually use an NVIDIA Shield.
[345.18 → 345.36] Yep.
[345.36 → 351.60] And stuff like, like Shield can automatically switch in between streaming stuff and Android apps.
[351.66 → 357.38] And this, you could make an Android version where it's a wired controller that plugs in through an OTG cable to your phone.
[357.56 → 361.68] And you could have this version, and you could just have, like, the plate interchangeable or something.
[362.04 → 365.60] But it's still not as fluid as a Shield could be.
[365.70 → 368.46] So this is, by every definition, a ghetto Shield.
[368.74 → 368.88] Yeah.
[368.88 → 369.44] Because it's cheap.
[369.62 → 370.70] It doesn't work as well.
[371.02 → 372.92] But it kind of can get the job done.
[373.00 → 373.18] All right.
[373.22 → 373.54] Here we go.
[373.58 → 374.84] You're launching, uh, Audio Surf?
[375.02 → 375.18] Yep.
[375.24 → 376.60] That's a pretty Twitch game.
[377.10 → 383.00] It, it's, and I don't have it fully, like, this game isn't exactly set up how it should be.
[383.66 → 384.02] Wait.
[384.10 → 385.76] I should be able to control it now, right?
[385.92 → 386.82] Uh, you should.
[387.02 → 388.86] But it's probably going to be hard for you to pick music.
[389.36 → 389.68] Okay.
[389.72 → 390.10] Go for it.
[390.80 → 392.04] Uh, do, do, do, do, do.
[393.50 → 393.86] Okay.
[393.96 → 395.50] So I'm turning on the Xbox controller.
[396.28 → 397.06] There we go.
[397.90 → 398.48] Let's go.
[399.88 → 400.74] Oh, yeah.
[400.96 → 401.86] Adhesive Wombat.
[402.54 → 405.18] I have never actually played Audio Surf with a controller before.
[405.86 → 409.74] So, uh, so to be clear, guys, it doesn't run in 720p like Shield does.
[409.78 → 411.56] It runs in, uh, 800 by 600.
[412.10 → 414.32] And I'm trying to get you guys a good view of it here.
[414.60 → 414.78] Yeah.
[414.90 → 415.90] Well, that should kind of work.
[416.38 → 420.14] So basically, yeah, you use the, uh, oh, oh, I see how it works.
[420.42 → 423.68] So you use the control sticks, and you actually can game.
[423.88 → 425.92] Now, we're quite far away from the router.
[426.04 → 426.34] Yeah.
[426.34 → 428.92] But I am playing Audio Surf.
[429.20 → 432.02] I played this earlier closer to the router.
[432.20 → 434.02] And you'll notice right now that there's a bit of lag.
[434.22 → 435.06] There's definitely lag.
[435.06 → 435.98] You can definitely notice that.
[436.26 → 438.94] I played this earlier closer to the router and it was fine.
[439.36 → 439.66] Right.
[439.70 → 439.96] Okay.
[439.96 → 442.58] And another thing, too, is we're not even running an AC router.
[442.94 → 443.48] So that's cool.
[443.54 → 448.82] Is one of the things that makes Shield work, according to the Nantes interview, uh, or, uh, review,
[449.00 → 454.94] is the fact that, uh, I mean, I'm just not playing very well right now, which I think has more to do with this being unsuccessful at the moment.
[454.94 → 458.58] But one of the things that makes Shield work is its excellent wireless implementation.
[458.80 → 480.80] But if you, uh, if you factor in that something like, um, an HTC One or Galaxy S4 supports wireless AC, so that's on the 5 gigahertz band, and you have an AC router, you could actually be looking at a very satisfactory gaming experience wirelessly, as long as you're close enough to your PC that your wireless controller will also work.
[480.80 → 481.70] So there you go.
[481.76 → 495.30] We'll be doing sort of a more full guide on the channel itself, um, including some side-by-side where we take this and put it next to the screen of the actual PC and show you how much of a delay there is and all that kind of stuff.
[495.30 → 502.20] But Audio Surf is playable on a router that's probably 25 feet from here through about...
[502.20 → 504.66] It's direct dimensions across if you're a two-story house.
[504.78 → 505.66] We're in the top left.
[505.74 → 506.56] It's in the bottom right.
[506.62 → 506.96] Yeah.
[507.36 → 508.26] So it's pretty far away.
[508.26 → 510.08] This is kind of a worst-case scenario.
[510.80 → 512.54] And, uh, so there you go, guys.
[512.64 → 515.96] One more thing I want to show, too, is if you want to just use this...
[515.96 → 517.42] The wireless one is the main best one.
[517.46 → 525.38] So if you want to just use this as a controller again, um, we attached it to the battery pack, and you can reach back there and attach the battery pack.
[525.38 → 525.76] Oh, yeah.
[525.84 → 528.52] You don't have to cannibalize your whole controller.
[528.72 → 529.64] You can just get...
[529.64 → 538.42] My understanding is you can buy the battery, um, the battery pack pieces separately, so you haven't actually ruined your controller either.
[538.62 → 539.80] You just have this thing.
[539.80 → 550.60] So you just spend however much it is to buy the replacement part of the battery pack for an Xbox controller, and you've got the whole rig, because you very possibly, if you own an Xbox, already have a wireless Xbox controller.
[550.78 → 553.50] Someone in Twitch says, this idea is full of fail.
[554.34 → 554.88] Too bad.
[555.50 → 556.02] Um...
[556.02 → 556.86] It's a ghetto shield.
[557.04 → 558.06] Yeah, it's a ghetto shield.
[558.26 → 560.78] It wasn't ever meant to actually defend you from anything.
[560.96 → 561.18] No.
[561.18 → 563.62] Because it's a shield?
[563.72 → 564.52] I got it.
[564.70 → 565.16] Thank you.
[567.46 → 568.10] Oh, man.
[568.74 → 571.26] So, so, I have to talk about this really shortly.
[571.52 → 571.60] Uh-oh.
[571.60 → 573.36] I didn't put in the after party, so you couldn't see it.
[574.00 → 574.48] Uh-oh.
[575.06 → 575.78] Actually, no, no, no.
[575.78 → 576.50] We'll do that first.
[576.80 → 577.06] What?
[577.20 → 577.66] It's okay.
[577.84 → 578.32] Do that first.
[578.32 → 581.26] I'll save this for later when we have fewer viewers, because you're not going to like it.
[581.50 → 581.76] Why?
[581.88 → 582.54] No, go for it.
[582.60 → 582.96] Fine.
[583.26 → 583.42] What?
[583.52 → 583.68] What?
[583.68 → 583.98] What?
[583.98 → 591.42] They are releasing, um, in one big pack, every single Elder Scrolls game and every single
[591.42 → 594.12] Elder Scrolls expansion ever released.
[594.36 → 597.98] So, in spite of the fact that you own all of those things already, you're buying it, aren't
[597.98 → 598.12] you?
[598.16 → 598.36] Yeah.
[598.52 → 598.84] Oh.
[600.42 → 602.48] Why do you buy things you already own?
[602.58 → 604.20] That's what drives me crazy.
[604.42 → 605.98] Okay, it comes with every map.
[606.86 → 607.30] Okay.
[607.64 → 611.10] So, I haven't unfolded or taken out my other maps.
[611.88 → 612.66] Oh, my.
[612.66 → 617.48] So, just so you can actually look at the maps, you are the worst type of collector.
[617.78 → 622.44] And I know you can get Arena and Dagger fall running on Windows 7, but I'm assuming that
[622.44 → 624.38] these will be much cleaner installs.
[626.04 → 627.06] I'll add that in there.
[627.20 → 628.84] Although, I've run it pretty cleanly.
[628.92 → 630.66] Like, I actually have a headache already.
[631.14 → 633.54] Just from, so, sorry, when are they doing this?
[633.58 → 636.38] You might as well give some details about it while I get this computer hooked up.
[636.56 → 641.14] Unfortunately, I've been working for the majority of time that this has been known, so I don't
[641.14 → 643.84] actually know that much about it, but I think it's September 1st.
[645.16 → 646.00] I think so.
[646.32 → 647.08] You're such a dork.
[647.18 → 650.46] Elder Scrolls Online is also having, like, this massive livestream today.
[651.32 → 651.48] But.
[652.32 → 654.92] Oh, maybe that's where everyone tuned out to go and, uh.
[654.92 → 655.28] I haven't seen it.
[655.42 → 656.12] To go and watch.
[656.96 → 657.40] I don't know.
[657.40 → 661.32] Except that based on how much people hate on you for talking about Elder Scrolls endlessly,
[661.46 → 663.40] I don't think too many of our viewers are that into it.
[665.12 → 665.76] I don't know.
[665.82 → 666.82] People ask for it, too.
[668.16 → 670.34] Yeah, but that's kind of like, uh, S&M.
[672.12 → 673.80] It's like, some people want the pain.
[673.80 → 678.04] There's sort of nothing we can do for them.
[678.94 → 682.30] So, uh, people have been asking us to play different games.
[682.72 → 687.04] Uh, however, we haven't actually set up the game streaming at all.
[687.24 → 691.66] So there's, uh, like, zero prep done for that right now.
[691.74 → 697.32] And we decided to just go ahead and launch the after party as opposed to, here, can you
[697.32 → 697.82] hold this for a sec?
[697.82 → 704.48] As opposed to wait until later to, uh, to kind of figure things out off camera and then
[704.48 → 705.92] come back after.
[706.56 → 709.68] Because people have complained about that approach as well.
[709.78 → 713.48] So at the end of the day, we don't really know what the right, uh, oh, you know what
[713.48 → 714.04] I should do?
[714.36 → 715.56] Oh, I want to do this.
[715.72 → 717.28] I'm going to tease the ninja video.
[718.50 → 718.82] Oh.
[719.80 → 720.24] Yeah.
[720.60 → 723.76] So this is like, this is like the best video ever.
[724.22 → 725.06] Have you seen it yet?
[725.34 → 725.58] Yeah.
[726.08 → 727.12] You've seen the In Progress?
[727.12 → 730.42] I went and specifically tried to go watch it.
[730.80 → 732.04] Because I usually didn't get them.
[732.94 → 733.30] Okay.
[733.48 → 734.16] So, uh, okay.
[734.26 → 735.40] What, what part should I tease?
[735.68 → 737.56] So it's about three and a half minutes long.
[737.78 → 739.84] And, uh, we made this for Be Quiet.
[740.02 → 740.86] Uh, the stairs.
[741.24 → 741.66] I should tease.
[741.72 → 742.02] Really?
[742.08 → 742.62] You think the stairs?
[742.88 → 743.74] Yeah, you're probably right.
[744.58 → 744.90] Okay.
[745.72 → 746.12] So.
[746.44 → 749.12] I obviously wanted to plug my part, but I think the stairs is perfect.
[749.98 → 751.64] Do, do, do, do, do.
[752.92 → 753.36] Okay.
[753.76 → 754.30] So there's the...
[754.30 → 755.78] They have no idea what's going on right now.
[755.78 → 756.28] Yeah, I know.
[756.28 → 757.86] They have no idea what's going on.
[757.86 → 759.02] Or the roof entrance.
[759.86 → 760.62] Oh, yeah.
[760.62 → 761.52] The entrances, the entrances.
[761.64 → 763.10] Why don't we just do the, uh, the beginning?
[763.28 → 763.46] Yeah.
[764.30 → 764.70] Okay.
[765.24 → 765.58] Okay.
[765.78 → 766.52] So here we go.
[766.56 → 767.18] Here we go, guys.
[767.66 → 771.60] So this is an upcoming, uh, upcoming video on the Tech Quickie channel.
[771.60 → 777.26] I hurt myself very seriously doing that.
[777.26 → 778.26] Okay.
[778.26 → 778.52] Okay.
[778.52 → 778.88] Shhh.
[778.88 → 779.36] Insurance.
[779.36 → 779.50] Insurance.
[779.50 → 791.18] All right.
[791.18 → 791.88] So, so hold on.
[792.02 → 792.32] Nope.
[792.44 → 792.66] Nope.
[792.72 → 793.00] We're done.
[793.10 → 793.56] That's enough.
[794.18 → 794.40] Okay.
[794.46 → 796.10] We'll, well, we'll show one more scene.
[796.22 → 797.14] We'll show one more scene.
[797.72 → 798.80] So, uh, yeah.
[798.84 → 802.56] Here's the here's the stair scene that, uh, Slick wanted us to show.
[802.56 → 805.02] So, okay, here we go.
[806.76 → 809.06] But yeah, we're, we're really excited to release this.
[809.12 → 811.40] We've also got a lot of greats behind the scenes for this one.
[813.40 → 815.12] What's cooler than ninjas with guns?
[817.52 → 818.64] Without sound, seriously.
[819.02 → 819.94] Without sound, shut up.
[822.90 → 825.08] Or should I say, be quiet.
[825.24 → 825.54] Whoa.
[826.08 → 826.42] Hello.
[826.42 → 826.64] Hello.
[826.64 → 832.76] So, you know, something bad's going to happen to him.
[833.70 → 837.48] Oh, and it happened to leg out at exactly the right moment for me to cut away from it
[837.48 → 842.22] and not tell you guys anything more about this video, except that, uh, Diesel's been
[842.22 → 843.30] working on it really hard.
[843.72 → 847.62] And hopefully we're going to have that available for you soon.
[847.80 → 851.46] My, my dad, Harrison, and I were talking, and my dad brought up this video because I'd
[851.46 → 851.92] mentioned it.
[852.08 → 853.78] And Harrison asked, oh, who's it for?
[854.30 → 855.36] So I let him go, be quiet.
[855.36 → 857.16] I was like, be quiet.
[857.68 → 858.92] And my dad was just like, what?
[860.82 → 861.54] I know.
[861.76 → 862.80] Their brand is so weird.
[863.08 → 865.30] And they have like an exclamation mark in it.
[865.40 → 865.64] Yeah.
[865.78 → 866.36] And I was just like.
[866.36 → 867.18] You have to like to yell it.
[867.22 → 867.52] Yeah.
[867.58 → 868.36] Which is not quiet.
[868.42 → 868.88] Be quiet!
[870.64 → 872.42] Um, someone asked who was the Asian girl.
[872.52 → 874.46] She was an actress that worked with us.
[874.50 → 875.82] She actually did a great job.
[876.64 → 877.04] Um.
[877.24 → 878.64] I wonder if anyone will recognize the gun.
[879.72 → 883.12] Yeah, we finally, why was the ninja sleeping on the stairs?
[883.98 → 884.30] Wow.
[884.30 → 884.70] Wow.
[885.36 → 886.70] Just leave.
[887.38 → 890.86] No, I mean, I never ask viewers to leave, but you can leave.
[891.12 → 891.42] What?
[892.58 → 893.42] No, I'm just kidding.
[893.52 → 895.76] The ninja on the stairs is dead from.
[896.04 → 896.52] He fainted.
[896.98 → 897.62] He fainted.
[897.92 → 898.82] He fainted from.
[899.68 → 900.54] From, uh.
[900.90 → 901.80] From damage.
[901.98 → 903.36] His health went to zero and he fainted.
[903.94 → 904.16] Yeah.
[905.22 → 906.16] Oh, man.
[906.36 → 906.68] Anyway.
[906.68 → 906.82] Anyway.
[907.34 → 907.52] Um.
[907.52 → 909.02] So.
[909.54 → 910.62] Oh, I've been like.
[910.68 → 913.68] I've been like completely sidetracked now.
[915.02 → 916.40] It's the after party.
[916.68 → 916.96] Oh, yeah.
[916.96 → 917.66] I guess it doesn't matter.
[917.74 → 918.22] Who cares?
[919.02 → 919.20] Yeah.
[919.20 → 920.48] Anyway.
[920.48 → 920.56] Anyway.
[920.68 → 920.98] Yes.
[921.04 → 923.34] It's the MP5s from the workplace video.
[923.50 → 927.50] We, we bought them just because they were like on super special at like Princess Auto
[927.50 → 928.20] for like.
[928.46 → 928.94] I think if.
[929.04 → 930.56] I wonder if you didn't buy them.
[930.82 → 932.42] If Diesel would still be a part of his company.
[932.68 → 933.10] I don't know.
[933.16 → 934.56] He plays with them like every day.
[934.82 → 935.76] I took one.
[935.96 → 938.32] I don't remember where or why.
[938.42 → 939.28] I think I had a reason.
[939.76 → 943.52] And I like heard someone walking around for a while and wasn't sure what was going on.
[943.52 → 945.52] And then he shows up and walks right to it.
[945.60 → 947.00] Picks it up and just walks away.
[947.12 → 947.86] I was like.
[948.12 → 948.40] Whoa.
[949.78 → 951.52] Well, you messed with his like.
[951.86 → 952.88] His gun prop.
[953.12 → 953.26] Yep.
[953.34 → 954.76] I think he has a lunch.
[954.86 → 955.10] Oh, no.
[955.16 → 957.96] He has the Adventure Time Thin Sword next to his desk now, too.
[958.00 → 959.38] He just like claims things.
[959.82 → 961.40] And they're just his, apparently.
[961.40 → 964.62] Which was actually kind of the intention.
[965.00 → 965.58] Of the Finn Sword.
[965.68 → 969.72] Of like some of the cool stuff from Think Geek is that we should, it should just be kind
[969.72 → 970.10] of around.
[970.20 → 970.52] At least the Finn Sword.
[970.94 → 971.18] Yeah.
[971.62 → 973.00] I knew the Finn Sword would be his.
[973.26 → 973.64] Yeah.
[974.16 → 976.80] I kind of thought Jake would be his as well, but Jake's somewhere.
[977.56 → 983.18] I put, I put the plush Jake on the desk that we were using to film that Corsair video.
[983.38 → 986.96] Yeah, we filmed a video for a Corsair product that may never see the light of day.
[987.04 → 988.84] So I feel super exclusive about it now.
[989.40 → 991.20] Because, you know, we have one.
[992.10 → 994.32] And I can't really give any details on it.
[994.46 → 997.74] But if someone asks where's Sting, Sting is down by the unboxing table.
[998.02 → 1000.40] So I haven't yet used Sting for unboxing.
[1000.40 → 1000.58] I was going to say.
[1001.12 → 1001.96] I keep forgetting.
[1002.28 → 1002.72] Oh, okay.
[1002.82 → 1008.62] I mean, the reason that I put a knife on my keychain was so that I wouldn't have
[1008.62 → 1008.86] one.
[1009.06 → 1012.32] Because I don't know if you used to watch my videos this long ago.
[1012.32 → 1018.66] But we, a cameraman and I would always get out in the middle of the parking lot to do
[1018.66 → 1021.10] like outdoor unboxing because we didn't have any lights.
[1021.10 → 1024.88] And we'd get there, and it's like a bit of a hike.
[1024.88 → 1028.54] And we'd be like, Linus, did you remember a knife this time?
[1028.74 → 1030.04] And I'd be like, oh, crap.
[1030.70 → 1035.94] So it's because I can never remember to bring the right knife that I have a knife on my keychain.
[1035.94 → 1039.00] So, yeah.
[1039.08 → 1040.38] And what is that knife again?
[1040.42 → 1041.66] That's actually like a nice knife.
[1041.82 → 1042.36] Who makes it again?
[1042.36 → 1043.12] It's a Spider.
[1043.22 → 1043.84] Spider, yeah.
[1043.84 → 1045.02] I'm not that impressed with it though.
[1045.12 → 1047.56] I think that like so many.
[1047.56 → 1053.68] It's amazing the different standards we have for certain products.
[1054.14 → 1063.70] Like the worst motherboard manufacturer I would trust more than like the best scissors manufacturer
[1063.70 → 1065.98] or the best phone case manufacturer.
[1066.12 → 1068.64] I don't know because blades, when you get high enough.
[1068.90 → 1070.58] Okay, blades are probably a bad example.
[1070.70 → 1070.88] Yeah.
[1070.88 → 1074.28] At the very, very high end, we're talking about pretty crazy stuff.
[1074.28 → 1077.10] Okay, but let's go with cell phone case manufacturer then.
[1077.56 → 1084.62] Like, I'm not convinced that the amount of validation that gets done on even the best cell phone case justifies the price.
[1084.76 → 1085.10] We've proved that.
[1085.22 → 1086.42] We've proven that.
[1087.18 → 1089.32] So, yeah.
[1089.68 → 1091.72] Someone asks if Corsair George is coming to the stream.
[1091.78 → 1094.80] We will definitely have Corsair George join us at some point.
[1094.92 → 1096.24] No, this is not a grasshopper.
[1096.30 → 1096.88] It's a ladybug.
[1099.02 → 1102.78] You know, not because of, you know, ladies or anything.
[1102.78 → 1103.22] But.
[1106.42 → 1106.82] Oh.
[1106.82 → 1110.38] Uh, we should do the we should do the what is it called?
[1110.50 → 1110.90] Matrix.
[1112.24 → 1112.56] Really?
[1112.68 → 1114.38] You, like, you're that excited to open this thing?
[1114.38 → 1114.98] I want to see it.
[1115.00 → 1117.06] Do you want to set up a live caller while I go grab it?
[1117.24 → 1118.02] Uh, whoa.
[1118.24 → 1119.02] I was not ready for that.
[1119.14 → 1119.66] I'll work on it.
[1119.86 → 1120.06] Yeah.
[1120.66 → 1122.10] Let's, uh, let's, let's get a caller.
[1122.88 → 1123.90] Because callers are fun.
[1125.06 → 1126.16] Especially when they shock you.
[1126.38 → 1127.66] Because you're into that sort of thing, right?
[1128.48 → 1129.16] Well, you are.
[1129.24 → 1129.94] You bought the Focus.
[1129.94 → 1131.94] Yeah, true that.
[1133.22 → 1133.90] That was, okay.
[1134.08 → 1134.84] Yeah, I'll give you that one.
[1137.26 → 1138.34] I walked into it.
[1138.66 → 1140.98] Pick me is not going to get you picked.
[1141.34 → 1143.68] Post questions in the open chat, please, sirs.
[1143.68 → 1144.96] Yeah, or like discussion topics.
[1144.96 → 1146.52] Post discussion topics or something.
[1146.78 → 1148.12] Post what you want to talk about.
[1148.24 → 1152.54] Something other people might be interested in is a good, uh, is a good hint.
[1152.82 → 1156.80] Unless you really desire to come on the live stream and say, pick me.
[1157.76 → 1160.16] Which, I mean, might be a thing.
[1160.16 → 1160.64] Could be possible, yeah.
[1160.72 → 1162.34] So we actually got two of these.
[1162.44 → 1168.08] This is the Razor Matrix, which is their super hyper premium fight stick.
[1168.08 → 1171.54] Um, which is, actually, this is kind of a funny product to me.
[1171.60 → 1175.78] Because Razor had zero presence in fight sticks.
[1176.18 → 1179.76] And then they were like, yeah, we're just going to make the completely balling-est one.
[1180.52 → 1182.60] And it's going to be completely customizable.
[1183.12 → 1186.04] And it's going to have, like, crazy build quality.
[1186.32 → 1187.60] And et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[1188.42 → 1193.14] Um, I mean, this is the kind of thing that they seem to do from time to time.
[1193.50 → 1197.84] Where it would never really occur to someone like a Logitech.
[1198.56 → 1201.68] I mean, I love Logitech gaming peripherals as much as anyone, I think.
[1202.24 → 1205.18] Uh, my second favourite all-time mouse is a Logitech mouse.
[1206.02 → 1209.74] Um, one of my favourite all-time keyboards is a Logitech keyboard.
[1209.86 → 1212.28] Like, they've done some really amazing stuff in the past.
[1212.40 → 1214.66] But sometimes it feels like they kind of do it by accident.
[1215.70 → 1218.30] Like, G15 felt like kind of an accident.
[1218.30 → 1218.52] Yeah.
[1218.86 → 1224.54] Like, they had this awesome, like, idea, sort of, like, of putting a screen on a keyboard,
[1224.72 → 1226.10] which I'm still not that sold on.
[1226.80 → 1227.52] I'm not at all.
[1227.52 → 1228.32] I never used it.
[1228.32 → 1228.66] At all.
[1228.90 → 1229.68] But I love the keyboard.
[1229.88 → 1232.48] But the keyboard itself was, like, awesome.
[1233.02 → 1238.54] Whereas it just, it seems like it would never occur to them to build something, like, crazy, weird, high-end.
[1238.62 → 1241.76] Like, you look at what, like, Sci Tech does with, like, flight sticks.
[1241.80 → 1241.96] Yeah.
[1241.96 → 1246.00] And then what Razor's doing now with, like, this, uh, game controller.
[1246.40 → 1248.34] But there's actually a huge market for this stuff.
[1248.40 → 1251.72] But I guess it just isn't, uh, it's not mainstream enough for them.
[1251.80 → 1256.08] And part of the problem is that when not very many people do it, not very many people get sold,
[1256.08 → 1257.76] because there's no mainstream companies doing it.
[1257.82 → 1262.74] So it's only not a large market because there isn't a large push for it.
[1262.74 → 1264.08] It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[1264.18 → 1264.30] Yeah.
[1264.30 → 1267.30] Because I think people have shown time and time again that when they're passionate about something,
[1267.76 → 1270.58] they're willing to pony up and buy a really nice one.
[1270.58 → 1275.60] So inside we find their usual, uh, outstanding packaging, black and green.
[1276.28 → 1280.18] Um, however, they've, uh, moved away from that on their outer cartons lately,
[1280.24 → 1281.92] and they do just a plain brown outer carton.
[1282.06 → 1287.04] You guys wouldn't believe how much less it costs to do a brown outer carton versus a black one.
[1287.22 → 1288.64] It makes a big difference.
[1289.64 → 1294.76] All right, then we got some closed cell foam, which I do like to see.
[1295.98 → 1297.58] And the Matrix itself.
[1298.42 → 1299.76] Have you seen this in person yet?
[1299.76 → 1299.98] No.
[1299.98 → 1301.18] Oh, okay, check it out.
[1302.54 → 1304.24] That's why I was so excited to see it.
[1304.84 → 1306.98] The After Party has turned into, like, unboxing.
[1307.78 → 1309.84] Yeah, the old, the, uh, the rubber, the rubber.
[1309.96 → 1310.34] That's really nice.
[1310.34 → 1312.98] Here, I'll let you give your impressions, because I already know about it.
[1313.04 → 1315.00] The first thing I noticed, oh, it's got some weight to it.
[1315.16 → 1315.52] Oh, yeah.
[1315.66 → 1316.94] I actually like that a lot.
[1317.04 → 1319.28] That's something that I noticed fading away in products,
[1319.34 → 1321.62] is that, that, like, nice, healthy weight feeling,
[1321.98 → 1323.32] where when you pick something up, and you're like,
[1323.36 → 1324.38] okay, that was made well.
[1324.88 → 1326.06] That didn't necessarily happen too much.
[1326.06 → 1329.66] Like, that product has that ghetto booty that I, like,
[1329.66 → 1333.20] it's got, it's got a nice back, so it probably won't slip too much.
[1333.42 → 1334.70] It seems really solid.
[1335.26 → 1337.04] I've never used a fight stick before.
[1337.66 → 1339.74] That being said, I've been in arcades, so.
[1339.98 → 1340.26] Right.
[1340.92 → 1343.34] If you've, if you've entered an arcade at some point,
[1343.42 → 1347.10] you are pretty familiar with the concept of what a fight stick should or shouldn't be.
[1347.26 → 1347.50] Yeah.
[1347.50 → 1349.72] All the buttons feel really nice.
[1349.80 → 1352.30] Anything that needs to be tactile is definitely tactile.
[1352.78 → 1353.64] It even sounds good.
[1353.86 → 1354.08] Yeah.
[1357.02 → 1358.52] You haven't opened it up yet, either.
[1359.38 → 1359.84] What?
[1360.20 → 1360.92] It opens up.
[1361.20 → 1361.38] What?
[1362.34 → 1362.64] How?
[1363.38 → 1363.66] Oh.
[1363.66 → 1363.70] Oh.
[1364.58 → 1365.22] That's cool.
[1366.12 → 1369.74] So you can, oh, so you could change, like, buttons and stuff.
[1369.88 → 1374.40] Because there's a big difference between how certain buttons feel and what they look like,
[1374.42 → 1375.46] and you could colour-code them and stuff.
[1375.54 → 1375.72] Okay.
[1375.94 → 1377.28] How exactly does this work?
[1378.98 → 1383.48] I'm just going to let him do that while I find one of the topics that I wanted to discuss
[1383.48 → 1384.72] on the after-party.
[1384.72 → 1388.68] I actually had a great after-party topic that I totally, totally forgot.
[1388.68 → 1390.14] Oh, oh, oh.
[1390.20 → 1394.00] We had a lot of people messaging us about this before.
[1394.52 → 1401.58] So, Britain, there's talk of having to opt in for internet porn and other adult content,
[1401.72 → 1403.06] whatever other adult content means.
[1403.48 → 1409.34] So, Manitoba Conservative MP Joy Smith here in Canada plans a bill that would preemptively
[1409.34 → 1411.28] block pornography in much the same way.
[1411.36 → 1414.26] So, they should have to opt in to internet porn, she says.
[1414.26 → 1420.00] Now, this whole article on cbc.ca is all fine and interesting and fascinating.
[1420.62 → 1422.36] And, of course, it's the usual thing.
[1422.56 → 1424.58] We're talking about protecting children.
[1424.90 → 1426.30] We're not talking about adults.
[1426.78 → 1427.98] And this is great.
[1428.48 → 1432.06] Adults can log onto their ISP computers.
[1433.48 → 1435.56] I laughed so hard when I read that.
[1435.76 → 1438.36] Check on the box and turn off the filter.
[1438.36 → 1445.24] All right, Joy, whatever your name is, Joy Smith, that is actually not how it works.
[1445.34 → 1449.06] And typically, anytime you have to communicate with your ISP about anything, it's a total
[1449.06 → 1449.56] It's horrible.
[1449.76 → 1453.62] cluster, that thing, that they're trying to block you from watching.
[1454.52 → 1455.12] Is that planned?
[1455.86 → 1456.84] Or was that just on the spot?
[1456.90 → 1457.46] Because that was good.
[1457.50 → 1458.10] That was on the spot.
[1458.18 → 1458.44] Thank you.
[1458.48 → 1458.62] That was good.
[1459.78 → 1460.96] And then there's a few.
[1461.08 → 1463.40] So, Winnipegosis had mixed reactions to the idea.
[1463.48 → 1466.42] And it's funny the article says this because the reactions weren't mixed at all.
[1466.42 → 1468.06] It looked pretty unanimously.
[1468.76 → 1469.72] Okay, so here's one.
[1470.06 → 1473.74] I'm not a big porn consumer, but I like the fact that I can watch what I want without having
[1473.74 → 1475.02] someone tell me what's acceptable.
[1475.46 → 1476.26] Also, what's porn?
[1476.44 → 1478.12] Is something that's nude but artistic porn?
[1478.84 → 1482.44] Is someone doing something very creative, but a little out there porn?
[1482.58 → 1485.16] Is what one Winnipeg said.
[1485.80 → 1489.66] You know, I can understand if you have kids, and you don't want porn on the computer, but
[1489.66 → 1494.48] I feel like that's something that you could opt out of just as easily as opt into.
[1494.48 → 1498.98] Someone else says, children need to be protected absolutely, but I think that's a parent's
[1498.98 → 1501.66] job, not the government's job, which I 100% agree with.
[1501.84 → 1503.48] And this is the part that killed me.
[1503.58 → 1504.40] So this is...
[1504.40 → 1505.02] I love this.
[1505.54 → 1512.14] So the quote at the end said, Smith said, regardless of public opinion, she plans to
[1512.14 → 1514.38] move forward with the bill when Parliament resumes in the fall.
[1514.92 → 1515.98] That is insane.
[1515.98 → 1521.34] Regardless of the opinion of the people who elected you to be their voice, you plan to
[1521.34 → 1521.92] move forward.
[1523.04 → 1524.96] That's just a sign of someone who shouldn't have been elected.
[1524.98 → 1526.40] You should never have been elected.
[1526.62 → 1526.76] No.
[1526.86 → 1527.64] And you know what?
[1527.66 → 1531.14] I don't actually feel that strongly about the whole thing.
[1531.22 → 1532.34] I think it should be...
[1532.34 → 1534.62] You know, my wife's superconservative.
[1535.00 → 1536.34] And I talked to her about this.
[1536.48 → 1538.68] And she basically went, well, why would it be opt-in?
[1538.70 → 1539.52] It should be opt-out.
[1539.70 → 1539.90] Yeah.
[1539.90 → 1541.90] And I was like...
[1541.90 → 1543.34] That would be fine.
[1543.58 → 1545.94] My worry is that what does it stop at?
[1546.02 → 1548.86] Exactly like when we talked about the one in the UK.
[1549.06 → 1550.00] What does it stop at?
[1550.08 → 1550.96] What is adult content?
[1551.06 → 1552.24] Just like one of the guys said in there.
[1552.48 → 1553.84] And opt-out, that's fine.
[1554.30 → 1555.74] That's totally fine.
[1555.86 → 1558.60] Yeah, there are 700 comments on this on cbc.ca.
[1558.74 → 1559.74] It's like a big deal.
[1560.96 → 1563.28] And the top comment is actually perfect.
[1563.56 → 1565.84] Regardless of public opinion, she plans to move forward with the bill.
[1565.90 → 1566.66] Is this a joke?
[1567.12 → 1569.30] I hope you never get elected again, Joy Smith.
[1569.30 → 1572.24] I highly doubt you even know how to use a computer properly.
[1572.44 → 1574.94] So you should likely keep your outdated views to yourself.
[1575.18 → 1575.66] Log into your...
[1575.66 → 1577.78] She obviously knows how to use her ISP computer.
[1577.78 → 1578.56] This is so great.
[1578.64 → 1580.22] This is like such a great quote.
[1580.80 → 1583.62] You can log into your ISP and check a box.
[1586.86 → 1587.68] Oh, man.
[1587.78 → 1588.54] Just...
[1588.54 → 1588.82] Oh.
[1589.60 → 1590.28] Like...
[1590.28 → 1591.66] It's not...
[1591.66 → 1593.06] It's not, you know, like...
[1593.06 → 1593.90] You know, it's not...
[1593.90 → 1596.42] It's not an S&M thing to slap yourself in the face.
[1596.42 → 1598.54] I was wondering if you're going to go there again.
[1599.30 → 1600.22] Yes!
[1600.58 → 1601.32] Find a way.
[1601.46 → 1602.72] I am on a roll tonight.
[1603.06 → 1604.40] This is really cool, by the way.
[1605.36 → 1606.40] Okay, okay, right, right.
[1606.44 → 1607.46] You want to talk about that thing.
[1607.62 → 1608.64] Okay, okay, show them the thing.
[1609.30 → 1609.58] Um...
[1609.58 → 1610.50] It's kind of baller.
[1610.50 → 1610.86] I love it.
[1610.88 → 1611.28] It's awesome.
[1611.38 → 1612.18] Here, do you want me to hold it for you?
[1612.30 → 1612.56] Sure.
[1615.06 → 1616.16] Talking about...
[1616.16 → 1616.62] Anyway...
[1616.62 → 1619.14] Speaking of horrible content on the internet, you shouldn't be watching.
[1619.30 → 1620.92] So, you can open it up really easily.
[1621.00 → 1623.82] The reason why I couldn't earlier was because there were the plastic things.
[1623.96 → 1624.36] Oh, right.
[1624.44 → 1625.10] That probably prevented it.
[1625.10 → 1625.12] Yeah.
[1625.12 → 1626.48] So, you just press the button.
[1626.56 → 1632.10] And it's not easy enough that while playing, if your, like, palm hits it, it's going to open.
[1632.20 → 1633.64] Like, you really have to chunk it down.
[1633.64 → 1642.54] Now, I know Racer can be a sponsor of us all they want on the WAN show, but, you know, with that said, Slick is not exactly a Racer hardware fanboy.
[1642.66 → 1643.56] Let's just put it that way.
[1643.60 → 1652.56] So, you can take anything he says about this with, uh, assume that, sort of, it's coming from someone who wouldn't just give them a pass on something that isn't good.
[1652.74 → 1653.42] Oh, my little Jesus.
[1654.04 → 1659.00] Um, the first thing I noticed was I decided to check out the packages before I checked out this, which I was more interested in.
[1659.00 → 1660.56] You always check out the packages first.
[1660.56 → 1660.84] Definitely.
[1660.84 → 1663.52] Um, and it comes with a replacement knob.
[1665.32 → 1665.72] Wow.
[1666.02 → 1667.06] This is endless to me.
[1668.96 → 1670.78] All jokes aside, it comes with a replacement knob.
[1670.78 → 1671.74] Can you let me touch your knob?
[1672.54 → 1672.96] Thank you.
[1672.98 → 1673.44] You like that?
[1673.60 → 1673.86] Yeah.
[1674.24 → 1674.96] You can put it in.
[1674.96 → 1676.34] Oh, this is a different-shaped knob.
[1678.54 → 1678.94] Oh.
[1679.48 → 1681.88] So, the one on the top is a very round knob.
[1681.94 → 1682.18] Yeah.
[1682.38 → 1684.80] And then this is more of, like, an oblong knob.
[1684.96 → 1685.30] Yeah.
[1685.90 → 1686.22] Okay.
[1686.86 → 1687.78] What else you got in there?
[1687.78 → 1691.02] So, not only if it runs out of durability.
[1691.36 → 1694.24] Can I use, like, super nerdy terms and say if it runs out of durability.
[1694.46 → 1695.50] Can you replace it?
[1695.54 → 1697.50] But if you don't like the style, you can replace that.
[1697.56 → 1699.08] I didn't notice it was a different style, actually.
[1699.48 → 1700.44] Plunk that back in there.
[1701.44 → 1703.72] Apartment and a compartment to hold your cable.
[1703.88 → 1706.28] This is the standard cable that comes with the unit that plugs in the back.
[1706.28 → 1708.62] So, if you ever have to be mobile, you just throw it in there.
[1708.88 → 1712.38] Then you don't have to worry about, like, your backpack full of cables that you have to haul around.
[1712.48 → 1713.82] Which is actually pretty cool.
[1714.20 → 1715.52] I thought it came with a screwdriver.
[1715.86 → 1716.92] Maybe that's still in the packaging.
[1717.04 → 1718.50] But there's a little spot here for a screwdriver.
[1718.54 → 1718.82] Oh, yeah.
[1718.86 → 1719.18] There it is.
[1719.32 → 1719.52] That's it.
[1719.98 → 1720.18] Yeah.
[1720.32 → 1722.66] So, it comes with a Phillips and flathead screwdriver.
[1722.94 → 1724.32] So, you can take the whole thing apart.
[1724.56 → 1727.98] And then all of these, I dare say modular.
[1727.98 → 1735.58] But you can replace the switches and this super easily with their, I guess, included screwdriver that I didn't notice before.
[1735.74 → 1737.52] And it was interesting to see how this worked.
[1738.56 → 1738.96] Oh, yeah.
[1738.96 → 1739.48] From the bottom.
[1739.70 → 1741.30] That's actually what I was most interested in.
[1741.38 → 1742.00] I was like, oh.
[1742.72 → 1744.90] So, it's actually more simple than I thought.
[1745.06 → 1745.74] That's kind of cool.
[1745.90 → 1752.96] And then something that he probably wouldn't have noticed because he's not much of a not much of a, of a, whatever these things are called again.
[1754.02 → 1755.36] I'm trying to hold it open.
[1755.50 → 1756.86] I'm making it hard to stay focused.
[1756.86 → 1757.04] Here.
[1757.04 → 1758.54] Oh, the hinge just stays open?
[1758.68 → 1758.82] Yeah.
[1758.88 → 1759.84] It has a hydraulic thing.
[1760.02 → 1760.70] Oh, that's kind of cool.
[1760.96 → 1761.20] Okay.
[1761.30 → 1768.04] So, these down here are screw points so that if you wanted to mount, the entire bottom of it is covered in, in mounting points.
[1768.04 → 1775.08] So, if you wanted to install any, like, custom modified hardware or any kind of, like, NATO stuff that you want to put in the bottom.
[1775.28 → 1776.22] I thought it was just a design.
[1776.34 → 1776.50] No.
[1776.50 → 1776.74] That's cool.
[1776.90 → 1777.44] That's really cool.
[1777.46 → 1777.48] No.
[1777.48 → 1778.76] There's a practical reason for it.
[1779.32 → 1780.66] So, uh, so there you go.
[1780.66 → 1787.02] And I think, ow, maybe not a lot, but if you had a little bit of extra gear, like a cable or something,
[1787.04 → 1788.96] very small, you could fit it in there as well.
[1789.62 → 1789.86] Yeah.
[1789.86 → 1792.72] And I think you can, I think you can replace the graphic on the top as well.
[1792.90 → 1793.84] It looks like it.
[1793.84 → 1794.58] It looks a little easily.
[1794.76 → 1797.36] There's the different hard points, and then it's just a glass panel.
[1797.72 → 1797.98] Yep.
[1798.76 → 1799.94] So, um, so yeah.
[1800.14 → 1800.92] It's both sides.
[1801.60 → 1801.92] Oh.
[1801.92 → 1802.00] Oh.
[1803.04 → 1803.32] Oh.
[1803.32 → 1804.40] No, no, I think there's something in there.
[1804.46 → 1805.58] Oh, I don't think I put the screw.
[1805.68 → 1807.42] Oh, yeah, the, uh, the knob's not in there, right?
[1807.72 → 1808.42] Just put it in.
[1809.18 → 1809.50] Thanks.
[1809.60 → 1810.04] I'm already done.
[1810.34 → 1810.88] I'm good at that.
[1810.90 → 1811.36] I'm already done.
[1811.56 → 1812.24] You're so fast.
[1813.50 → 1814.86] You're like Captain Efficiency.
[1815.72 → 1816.08] Um.
[1816.08 → 1821.46] That ended abruptly.
[1821.66 → 1825.86] Apparently when I, when I was talking about the knob, someone could only hear video, or
[1825.86 → 1827.96] they could only hear audio, and it was pretty creepy.
[1828.72 → 1830.54] I've never been creepy before in my life.
[1830.78 → 1832.28] How do you not only hear audio?
[1832.68 → 1833.18] I don't know.
[1834.22 → 1834.48] Because.
[1835.00 → 1836.14] My back's really itchy.
[1836.26 → 1837.78] I've been like itching my back the whole time.
[1837.84 → 1838.98] Did you see that sunburn I had?
[1839.52 → 1839.88] Yeah.
[1840.00 → 1840.60] How's that going?
[1840.60 → 1843.90] It's peeling like crazy right now, so it's like all itchy, so there's going to be like
[1843.90 → 1845.70] skin flakes all over the couch and stuff.
[1845.72 → 1847.60] Again, who told me about that was my mom.
[1848.54 → 1852.48] I think your mom actually follows me closer on Twitter than you do.
[1853.30 → 1853.70] Yeah.
[1853.90 → 1857.28] And follows Diesel, like, religiously as far as I can tell.
[1857.98 → 1858.84] Which is just.
[1858.86 → 1859.52] That's a good tip.
[1859.66 → 1860.44] Diesel the intern.
[1860.60 → 1863.82] Follow him on Twitter if you want like all the leaks ever that Linus ignores.
[1863.84 → 1866.24] I just, I pretend I don't know about it.
[1867.24 → 1870.32] I'm pretty sure he just shows all of our upcoming content.
[1870.60 → 1874.92] And then like, I'm doing like reveals of like particular scenes or whatever.
[1875.06 → 1875.64] And it's already been revealed.
[1875.64 → 1877.26] And it's probably been out there.
[1877.38 → 1883.64] Like, not only the iteration I'm showing, but like the previous ones that like just bruise
[1883.64 → 1883.84] LE.
[1884.12 → 1884.64] Brussels?
[1884.82 → 1885.26] Brussels.
[1885.84 → 1886.14] Yeah.
[1886.24 → 1888.02] He also talks a lot of gaming stuff.
[1888.02 → 1894.24] More like, um, more pro gaming stuff than either Slick or I really get into.
[1894.60 → 1897.40] So he's, uh, he's done.
[1897.64 → 1900.28] Linus show should be blocked for in the UK for adult content.
[1900.60 → 1904.58] I don't necessarily disagree with that at this point in time.
[1904.92 → 1910.24] I mean, between like the, uh, you know, the, the pure innuendo that makes up this show
[1910.24 → 1916.82] and all the, uh, the, uh, you know, the like fetish, like back flakes and stuff that
[1916.82 → 1917.46] we've got going on.
[1917.64 → 1918.64] Fetish back flakes?
[1918.64 → 1920.62] I don't think back flakes is a fetish.
[1920.86 → 1928.04] Although if it was, then, um, I'm going to put on this headset now, and we have a live
[1928.04 → 1929.78] collar, I think, which I'd totally forgotten about.
[1929.84 → 1931.46] I wish you would have reminded me before.
[1932.00 → 1934.34] Well, he was connecting to the chat room when I pointed at it.
[1934.34 → 1935.54] Oh, okay.
[1935.56 → 1936.36] It's actually a fairly recent thing.
[1936.90 → 1937.26] All right.
[1937.28 → 1938.02] Who's our colour?
[1938.76 → 1939.46] All right, man.
[1939.76 → 1944.40] Uh, click on the headset button in the top left-hand corner of your Racer comes window.
[1945.06 → 1946.96] Unlike when open, that's okay here.
[1948.04 → 1948.44] Okay.
[1948.56 → 1948.90] Oh, wait.
[1948.94 → 1949.60] Am I in the wrong one?
[1949.64 → 1950.30] It's not live show?
[1950.50 → 1952.22] You need to have that open though.
[1952.44 → 1953.60] As in here.
[1953.70 → 1954.00] Hold on.
[1954.14 → 1954.28] Yeah.
[1954.28 → 1954.40] Yeah.
[1954.40 → 1954.96] I got this.
[1955.78 → 1956.14] Okay.
[1956.54 → 1956.96] Double click.
[1957.20 → 1957.78] Boom, boom, boom.
[1958.60 → 1959.10] There we go.
[1959.12 → 1959.84] There we go.
[1960.02 → 1961.04] And boom.
[1962.20 → 1963.28] Racer comes is fired up.
[1963.32 → 1968.90] Guys, remember, if you haven't done it already or if you have done it already, please click
[1968.90 → 1970.84] this link, download Racer comes.
[1970.94 → 1971.82] Makes us look awesome.
[1973.00 → 1974.34] Where are you pointing at?
[1976.46 → 1977.78] I mean, I didn't take it there.
[1979.46 → 1980.22] All right.
[1980.54 → 1981.62] El Guido.
[1981.96 → 1983.06] We cannot hear you.
[1983.48 → 1985.50] Although I haven't seen your mic thing post at all.
[1985.50 → 1988.10] So I think it's probably on your end.
[1992.04 → 1992.48] Oops.
[1992.54 → 1993.70] I clicked some weird thing.
[1994.34 → 1994.62] Oh, wait.
[1994.70 → 1995.86] I'm live in, uh, oops.
[1995.96 → 1997.10] I'm live in live show.
[1998.46 → 1999.84] I'm not live in WAN show.
[2000.08 → 2000.76] What a noob.
[2001.20 → 2001.40] Yeah.
[2001.42 → 2002.00] It's my fault.
[2002.06 → 2002.86] I clicked the wrong thing.
[2003.28 → 2003.78] There we go.
[2004.20 → 2004.50] Boom.
[2004.62 → 2005.10] El Guido.
[2005.38 → 2005.70] Hello.
[2007.64 → 2008.56] Hey, can you hear me?
[2008.96 → 2009.62] We can.
[2010.38 → 2010.82] Okay.
[2010.86 → 2011.36] That's good.
[2011.36 → 2012.66] Um, yeah.
[2012.66 → 2018.78] Uh, my question is, uh, I have, uh, no space at all in my, uh, tiny, tiny basement suite
[2018.78 → 2026.46] and was wondering, should I try to attempt to build, um, a small PC like an IT or should
[2026.46 → 2027.44] I just go for a laptop?
[2028.40 → 2029.48] That's a great question.
[2029.54 → 2029.94] Actually.
[2030.76 → 2035.06] Um, if you've checked out some of the build logs on our forum, actually, there's the guy
[2035.06 → 2037.60] that made the flat, flat pack server, basically.
[2038.10 → 2041.84] So if you could do something, of course, you're going to want a graphics card, I'm assuming,
[2041.92 → 2042.66] because you said gaming.
[2043.02 → 2047.30] So it won't exactly be flat pack mounted on the wall, but you could make something small
[2047.30 → 2048.58] and put it up on the wall.
[2048.76 → 2050.94] Being, I've, I've lived in small places before.
[2051.04 → 2054.80] You start to utilize your walls a lot more than you do in a big, wide open house.
[2055.08 → 2058.70] So mounting stuff up on the walls, putting stuff in interesting places, whether you strap
[2058.70 → 2061.86] it to the bottom of your desk or mount it up on the wall, it could be really helpful.
[2062.02 → 2063.68] Putting stuff in interesting places, you say?
[2063.92 → 2064.18] Yep.
[2064.18 → 2070.56] And like JJ showed us earlier on the stream, they have their new, uh, IT boards coming
[2070.56 → 2072.40] out with those extended PCBs.
[2072.48 → 2078.02] So you can actually get really, really, really nice IT boards that are quite powerful.
[2078.02 → 2082.64] And especially with Z87, where everything's kind of not as big of a deal, depending on what
[2082.64 → 2083.14] board you get.
[2084.38 → 2088.16] And gaming laptops are something where honestly, they're improving.
[2088.56 → 2093.32] They're improving, but their life stands are still kind of an issue, I've found.
[2093.32 → 2096.98] And they tend to get really hot, and they tend to get really loud.
[2096.98 → 2101.46] And you don't have the same usability of a desktop with all the different IO and everything.
[2101.46 → 2103.00] And no degradability.
[2103.00 → 2104.48] I mean, that's a big thing too.
[2105.14 → 2105.84] Yeah, that's...
[2105.84 → 2107.84] Go ahead.
[2107.84 → 2111.66] That's why I was, um, haven't made a decision yet.
[2111.66 → 2115.22] Because I know you can't upgrade a laptop like you can a desktop.
[2115.22 → 2117.14] Because here's my issue with it.
[2117.70 → 2123.84] The last three, four generations of Intel processors haven't really brought anything meaningful
[2123.84 → 2127.58] to the table from a gaming performance perspective if you bought something.
[2127.68 → 2133.68] So if you spent $400 way back in, uh, it must have been, what year is it now?
[2134.30 → 2135.48] So like 2010?
[2135.48 → 2138.28] When was the i7 920 released?
[2138.86 → 2140.86] It was either 2009 or 2010.
[2141.32 → 2147.48] So if you spent $400 on that chip at launch, you are still having a very similar gaming experience
[2147.48 → 2152.98] to someone who spends $300 on an i7 4770K today.
[2153.72 → 2155.56] Uh, particularly if you overclocked.
[2155.56 → 2157.48] Because the stock speeds are much higher these days.
[2157.48 → 2163.32] Whereas with graphics cards, back then we were talking 8800 series.
[2163.74 → 2166.96] And now we're talking graphics cards that are much faster.
[2167.08 → 2171.26] So from a gaming perspective, um, that's the problem with a gaming laptop.
[2171.52 → 2173.36] Is not being able to change the graphics card.
[2173.42 → 2176.22] Not that I think the CPU is going to be a problem in the near future.
[2176.64 → 2182.52] So IT means that even if you don't plan to re-buy all the components all the time,
[2182.82 → 2186.02] you can keep that same system and keep swapping in graphics cards.
[2186.02 → 2188.16] And you're going to get a much longer lifetime out of it.
[2188.24 → 2190.46] Not to mention that they're less expensive to begin with.
[2190.46 → 2195.48] So you could almost get yourself a value-oriented Lenovo gaming notebook
[2195.48 → 2200.98] and a value-oriented IT gaming PC for the same price as a premium gaming notebook
[2200.98 → 2206.02] such as a G series or a Racer Blade series, um, alone.
[2206.48 → 2206.92] Yep.
[2207.10 → 2207.32] Yeah.
[2207.46 → 2212.02] And, and like if you can afford the space for a small tower, you can have it there.
[2212.08 → 2213.68] Or like I said, hang it up on the wall.
[2213.74 → 2215.04] Or you can have it pretty far away.
[2215.04 → 2217.52] Uh, USB extensions, Red mere cables.
[2218.08 → 2218.46] Yeah.
[2219.88 → 2220.58] Yeah, yeah.
[2220.68 → 2224.76] That, that'll probably go for something small like an IT.
[2224.80 → 2226.86] Any recommendations for, uh, cases?
[2228.06 → 2228.50] Cases.
[2229.76 → 2231.04] Prodigy's actually kind of big.
[2231.14 → 2232.32] Yeah, Prodigy's kind of big.
[2232.42 → 2233.88] Uh, go for something from Silverstone.
[2234.02 → 2235.98] The FT-03 Mini is outstanding.
[2236.22 → 2237.70] It's extremely space efficient.
[2237.70 → 2244.20] It's capable of being liquid cooled with an all-in-one single 120mm radiator, and it can handle pretty much any graphics card.
[2244.58 → 2244.80] No.
[2245.04 → 2245.76] Wait, that one can't.
[2245.76 → 2246.06] The Cubic case.
[2246.58 → 2248.52] Uh, I don't know about the Cubic one.
[2248.64 → 2249.22] It's pretty good.
[2249.22 → 2250.22] The cooling's not that great.
[2251.20 → 2251.64] No.
[2251.84 → 2252.42] How, are you planning on...
[2252.42 → 2253.48] Silverstone's other one?
[2254.96 → 2255.44] No.
[2256.92 → 2257.98] Get a Node 304.
[2259.38 → 2259.78] Yeah.
[2260.36 → 2260.58] Yeah.
[2260.70 → 2261.72] Are those still kind of big?
[2262.22 → 2263.06] It's not that big.
[2263.54 → 2264.98] It's about the size of the shuttle.
[2265.66 → 2271.28] Speaking of which, shuttle also has all-in-one, uh, PCs that have two expansion slots, which is kind of neat.
[2271.56 → 2274.48] Mind you, you'll probably fill both of them with a, uh...
[2274.48 → 2275.68] With a graphics card.
[2275.68 → 2279.22] Oh, yeah, and the Elite 120 from Cooler Master is one I just saw a message about.
[2279.62 → 2282.60] But I would go with the, uh, Node 304 from Fractal Design.
[2282.74 → 2288.18] It supports not only, uh, large graphics cards, but also, uh, lots of storage, potentially.
[2288.50 → 2289.58] So you've got a lot of flexibility.
[2290.06 → 2291.70] I had temporarily forgotten what that was.
[2292.14 → 2292.28] Yeah.
[2292.28 → 2293.40] But, yeah, it gets used a ton.
[2293.50 → 2297.36] Almost every time I see recommendations for a tiny computer, it's Node 304.
[2298.02 → 2300.68] Yeah, I just Googled that and it actually looks pretty small.
[2301.34 → 2301.52] Yeah.
[2301.60 → 2302.26] It's very small.
[2302.26 → 2304.60] Yeah, this, uh, this could work.
[2304.96 → 2305.34] Thank you.
[2305.38 → 2305.68] All right.
[2305.96 → 2309.92] Well, thank you for calling in, and I think we should, uh, take another caller if we're able to do that.
[2309.94 → 2310.86] I'll look for another guy.
[2310.98 → 2311.26] All right.
[2311.26 → 2311.98] If you keep moving forward.
[2315.16 → 2315.80] All right.
[2316.18 → 2317.56] I did have another...
[2317.56 → 2319.14] Oh, this is your thing.
[2319.36 → 2320.88] The Elder Scrolls Anthology announced.
[2321.34 → 2326.54] Oh, my wife sent me an article last night that I really wanted to, uh, talk about on the After Party.
[2327.54 → 2329.98] I still have my, uh, Windows 9 thing.
[2330.68 → 2331.40] Oh, yeah.
[2331.40 → 2332.68] We actually ended up going over that.
[2332.84 → 2333.74] Yeah, we should do that.
[2333.88 → 2334.56] Do you want to do that now?
[2335.22 → 2336.94] Um, find us another caller first.
[2337.02 → 2337.12] Sure.
[2337.12 → 2338.18] Let's do that after the next caller.
[2338.36 → 2338.62] Sure.
[2339.94 → 2341.80] We streamed for a really long time.
[2342.10 → 2342.70] I'm, like, tired.
[2343.26 → 2343.52] Yeah.
[2343.52 → 2343.58] Yeah.
[2344.94 → 2346.20] I wonder what happened.
[2346.30 → 2348.56] Why we had so many viewers and then so few.
[2348.98 → 2351.02] I think I'll email Twitch tonight and I'll ask.
[2351.14 → 2352.30] It had started dropping again.
[2352.30 → 2354.38] I know, but it was just pretty dramatic.
[2354.70 → 2356.44] Usually it doesn't taper off so quickly.
[2356.98 → 2358.20] I wonder if we're just boring.
[2358.70 → 2359.02] Maybe.
[2359.54 → 2360.10] Could be boring.
[2360.30 → 2362.48] Because we, you're right, we don't usually taper that quickly.
[2362.70 → 2362.98] Yeah.
[2363.18 → 2363.52] It was kind of weird.
[2363.52 → 2367.74] But we do, at, at around that time point, one of our time zones goes to bed.
[2368.06 → 2368.64] That's true.
[2368.76 → 2371.12] And we were front page on Twitch.
[2371.24 → 2371.78] For a while.
[2371.90 → 2372.48] For a while.
[2372.74 → 2375.44] So people could have been tuning in and then going to sleep.
[2375.64 → 2375.84] Yeah.
[2376.22 → 2378.18] So there's the it could be a combination of things.
[2381.36 → 2382.20] Guys, you're right.
[2382.34 → 2383.16] Because JJ left.
[2383.16 → 2385.44] But it had started declining before he left.
[2385.52 → 2387.02] It just, after he left, it kind of dropped.
[2387.02 → 2387.84] He was a good guest, though.
[2388.02 → 2388.36] He was.
[2388.98 → 2389.86] Didn't let you talk much.
[2389.86 → 2391.28] It's impossible to talk for me.
[2391.40 → 2391.70] Yeah, I know.
[2391.72 → 2392.56] Actually impossible.
[2392.68 → 2392.94] I know.
[2393.34 → 2394.12] There wasn't much I could do about it.
[2394.12 → 2397.92] At one point in time, I was like, Steamroller, I'm going to talk right now.
[2398.24 → 2398.82] Yeah, I saw that.
[2398.88 → 2399.48] That was awesome.
[2399.84 → 2401.18] I wanted to say something.
[2401.40 → 2402.96] I was like, I've been sitting here for half an hour.
[2403.96 → 2405.72] I mean, you know what?
[2405.72 → 2411.52] I think that part of it is that JJ is so passionate about the technology.
[2412.00 → 2413.42] And that's why he's a perfect guest.
[2413.58 → 2413.76] Yeah.
[2413.96 → 2414.20] Yeah.
[2414.32 → 2418.18] And like, I'm happy to have him back because he's a perfect guest, and he really knows
[2418.18 → 2418.78] what he's talking about.
[2419.00 → 2421.86] But like, there are a few things that I actually wanted to say.
[2422.00 → 2426.94] Like when he was talking about how he's actually an engineer, not a marketer.
[2427.16 → 2427.38] Yeah.
[2427.60 → 2428.92] I was going to say, that's interesting.
[2429.12 → 2430.28] You're also not a marketer.
[2430.64 → 2430.82] Yeah.
[2430.82 → 2432.08] But had a marketing style position.
[2432.08 → 2435.66] And I find that in specialized fields like computers.
[2435.66 → 2437.06] Well, was in a marketing position.
[2437.10 → 2437.92] Was in a marketing position.
[2439.04 → 2443.46] In specialized fields like computers, it actually makes a lot more sense to have someone that's
[2443.46 → 2446.58] hardcore instead of someone that's marketing oriented.
[2446.76 → 2448.74] But it really depends on who they're talking to.
[2448.82 → 2449.08] For sure.
[2449.14 → 2456.78] So JJ makes a ton of sense when he gets to talk to reviewers and gets to talk to our audience.
[2457.56 → 2459.40] And that makes sense.
[2459.40 → 2465.06] But when you're trying to put together a marketing program for the product manager at New egg,
[2465.46 → 2467.36] or worse yet, Amazon.
[2467.74 → 2467.82] Yeah.
[2467.94 → 2469.72] Amazon's a super mainstream company.
[2470.02 → 2477.12] I can tell you, I know that at least one of their computer product managers used to handle shoes before computer parts.
[2477.12 → 2483.68] And was moved over to computer parts, not because of a particular passion for computers, but because they were good at shoes.
[2483.88 → 2485.48] And they're trying to develop the category.
[2486.48 → 2489.42] And putting someone like JJ in front of that girl.
[2490.04 → 2490.52] It's like.
[2491.06 → 2491.42] Yeah.
[2491.48 → 2492.28] But then you're going to.
[2492.38 → 2492.86] It's a Seuss.
[2492.94 → 2493.88] They're going to have more than one marketing.
[2493.98 → 2494.26] Yes.
[2494.54 → 2495.06] And they do.
[2495.06 → 2497.56] And like, it makes sense to have someone like JJ.
[2497.68 → 2499.28] And that's going to be a powerhouse of your company.
[2499.28 → 2509.66] And part of the other problem is that the overlap between people who are highly technical and people who are very eloquent and well-spoken is sometimes not that big.
[2509.74 → 2510.22] You're right.
[2510.54 → 2514.88] That's why some companies, just to bring in the software side of things, you'll have your programmers.
[2515.20 → 2518.04] You'll have your, like, board of directors.
[2518.04 → 2520.56] And then you'll have the dude that is in between.
[2520.86 → 2524.60] And literally his entire job is just to talk to both sides and translate.
[2525.36 → 2526.84] Seriously, that is a position.
[2527.02 → 2529.84] Because they speak two entirely different languages.
[2530.04 → 2533.06] And to have someone that actually understands both is sometimes rare.
[2534.58 → 2538.06] And that happens, like, I'm only saying programmers because that's my field.
[2538.22 → 2540.60] It happens more than just the programmer field.
[2540.60 → 2549.48] So the like, super crazy lead of the motor development thing for some car company probably can't talk very well to the CEO.
[2550.02 → 2550.30] Right.
[2550.92 → 2552.86] But, like, is probably a frigging genius.
[2553.28 → 2554.02] Of course, yeah.
[2555.18 → 2557.98] Here's that news article that I wanted to bring up.
[2558.06 → 2559.32] It's nothing to do with technology.
[2559.32 → 2565.64] But there's a guy in the U.S. that returns more than $500,000 in quarters.
[2565.64 → 2574.10] So he got a half a million dollar insurance payout when his son died in a 2001 car wreck.
[2574.34 → 2580.86] And the other passengers that were in the wreck sued that they didn't get enough of the money.
[2581.62 → 2584.56] And basically the court overturned the decision.
[2585.18 → 2592.24] And all these years later is giving the money to the others.
[2592.24 → 2609.04] And the kind of ridiculous thing about it is that, so, okay, yes, to resolve years-long feuding among the crash of survivors over how the $800,000 in insurance proceeds were divvied up, the he was required to pay it back.
[2609.44 → 2614.40] So pretty much, he, I think he was saying he doesn't really need the money.
[2614.48 → 2617.60] Okay, right, he got a $1.6 million compensation through his own coverage.
[2617.60 → 2624.94] So he doesn't really need the money, but the point he's trying to make is that he wanted to draw attention to what's going on here.
[2625.46 → 2636.24] Someone who died is ultimately getting a smaller payout than people who didn't die because they're whining and bitching and moaning about it.
[2636.80 → 2644.16] And, yeah, he said he really wanted to do it in pennies, but he found that that wasn't going to be feasible.
[2644.16 → 2644.68] Yeah.
[2644.82 → 2647.14] So it ended up being, I think it was.
[2647.16 → 2648.64] I think it becomes illegal at a certain point.
[2648.66 → 2650.46] Yeah, four tons in quarters.
[2651.98 → 2652.88] Holy cow.
[2653.00 → 2654.28] How do you even withdraw that?
[2654.76 → 2656.36] Like, where do you go to get that?
[2657.32 → 2659.48] Obtained from the Federal Reserve in St. Louis.
[2659.80 → 2659.90] Holy cow.
[2659.90 → 2668.48] The back-breaking load of change was brought in Wednesday by an armoured vehicle and delivered on a flatbed truck to two law firms that represented other victims of the wreck.
[2669.98 → 2670.76] Holy cow.
[2670.76 → 2679.20] And he just says there was no satisfaction from doing that, but the loss of a child is the loss of a child, and all the money doesn't replace that.
[2680.38 → 2680.82] Yeah.
[2681.82 → 2689.48] Like, if they decided that and then added funds to the pool instead of trying to take it from him, it'd be like, okay.
[2689.92 → 2690.36] Yeah.
[2690.36 → 2699.02] Although, to play devil's advocate, the people that are alive might need it more, if they're in medical situations or whatever.
[2700.36 → 2701.14] I don't know.
[2703.46 → 2705.24] It's just kind of sketchy.
[2706.24 → 2706.72] What's that?
[2706.72 → 2710.32] Don't need to add more stress to someone that's in a situation like that.
[2710.88 → 2711.78] Yeah, that's brutal.
[2711.78 → 2715.58] People are talking too much instead of asking questions.
[2716.36 → 2718.70] Okay, so people are just generally, like, chatting?
[2719.70 → 2723.22] I have a topic concerning phones and connection standards that...
[2723.98 → 2725.92] Oh, someone said something, so it's gone.
[2728.00 → 2733.14] All right, so we're bringing on Jeff3864.
[2733.14 → 2739.28] I had seen him say previously, while we were talking, while glancing over, that it's specifically...
[2739.28 → 2741.44] I think it might be against your thing with micro USB.
[2741.90 → 2742.50] Oh, all right.
[2743.48 → 2746.60] Well, Jeff's wrong already before he even gets on the show then, but...
[2746.60 → 2750.12] But at the same time, if it was agreeing with you, it'd be really boring.
[2750.44 → 2751.42] So I'm actually kind of happy.
[2751.96 → 2752.58] You're kind of happy.
[2752.58 → 2753.06] I agree with you.
[2753.26 → 2754.08] I'm on your side.
[2754.94 → 2757.30] Yeah, but you have to be on my side because I pay you.
[2757.86 → 2759.54] I disagree with you all the time.
[2759.64 → 2760.90] That's true, and you're fired.
[2763.14 → 2769.68] I think if you don't have at least some amount of opposing opinions, it's kind of boring.
[2770.14 → 2772.34] Unless it's, like, an information school.
[2772.46 → 2774.08] All right, so which room are you inviting him to?
[2775.16 → 2776.06] Live in Wan show.
[2776.08 → 2776.82] Live in Wan show.
[2776.90 → 2779.72] All right, bring it on, Mr. Disagree.
[2780.58 → 2781.40] Nope, not you.
[2781.48 → 2781.88] Or Mrs.
[2782.12 → 2782.52] There we go.
[2782.68 → 2783.08] Or Ms.
[2783.46 → 2784.28] Whichever you prefer.
[2784.80 → 2787.78] My neck friggin' hurts from that flip off the fence, though.
[2788.34 → 2788.84] Really still?
[2788.84 → 2790.16] It's still kind of bad.
[2790.40 → 2790.56] Yeah.
[2790.70 → 2791.70] You're not supposed to talk about that.
[2791.80 → 2792.42] Oh, whatever.
[2792.42 → 2793.46] You're not insured for that.
[2793.58 → 2793.78] Oh.
[2794.42 → 2794.72] Okay.
[2795.12 → 2795.74] Fair enough.
[2797.46 → 2798.32] Hello, Jeff.
[2798.54 → 2799.50] Welcome to the live show.
[2800.70 → 2801.54] The Wan show.
[2802.70 → 2803.94] The after party, actually.
[2804.12 → 2804.66] The after party.
[2804.94 → 2805.22] Sure.
[2807.42 → 2808.56] He's in the Wan show room.
[2809.24 → 2810.12] He says crap.
[2810.94 → 2811.94] Why don't we not have a mic?
[2812.16 → 2813.02] Can you not hear me?
[2813.14 → 2813.86] No, we can't.
[2814.08 → 2814.28] Yeah.
[2814.28 → 2816.12] Your mic is not actuating at all.
[2816.12 → 2822.26] So, to be clear, Mr. Knows so much about connection standards.
[2823.54 → 2827.26] You have to actually plug the thing into the thing.
[2827.32 → 2829.34] Maybe his mic is using micro USB.
[2829.46 → 2830.36] Yeah, it's probably using mic.
[2830.36 → 2831.04] It's probably broken.
[2831.20 → 2833.58] Maybe it's past its like 300 plugins.
[2833.88 → 2835.50] Yeah, he says he's against micro USB.
[2836.04 → 2837.30] Maybe he has another idea, though.
[2837.40 → 2837.56] Oh.
[2837.56 → 2838.36] This is going to be boring.
[2839.84 → 2840.28] 7H.
[2840.36 → 2840.82] So, yes.
[2841.22 → 2841.70] Oh.
[2843.04 → 2843.48] Wow.
[2843.76 → 2844.28] Oh.
[2845.40 → 2845.84] Yeah.
[2845.96 → 2851.26] So, for those of you who don't get it, the Steel Series 7H uses, for whatever reason,
[2851.26 → 2858.94] a micro USB connection between the detachable cable and the left ear cup, and it is notorious
[2858.94 → 2862.94] for failing.
[2864.14 → 2864.76] Mine died.
[2865.18 → 2866.58] But mine took a few years.
[2867.36 → 2870.84] So, but mine wasn't abused or ever plugged in or unplugged at all.
[2871.74 → 2872.00] So.
[2873.18 → 2875.24] My dad's died.
[2875.52 → 2877.56] It wasn't abused, but it was unplugged and plugged in.
[2877.82 → 2880.42] And my friends died three times until they just gave up.
[2880.72 → 2881.02] Right.
[2881.46 → 2881.76] Okay.
[2882.56 → 2885.34] I'm not entirely sure that one wasn't abused, though.
[2885.62 → 2887.56] I'm excited to check out the 9H, though.
[2888.24 → 2888.40] Yeah.
[2888.40 → 2889.40] We have a sample coming soon.
[2889.42 → 2889.86] Is it micro USB?
[2890.26 → 2891.16] I don't think so.
[2891.26 → 2892.20] I think they learned their lesson.
[2892.56 → 2892.96] Sweet.
[2893.12 → 2893.38] Yeah.
[2894.10 → 2896.10] So, I'm super, super stoked on that.
[2896.50 → 2896.96] That's cool.
[2897.04 → 2898.74] I like it when companies listen and change things.
[2899.64 → 2901.40] We should, like, play a game or something.
[2902.48 → 2903.28] Using those.
[2904.90 → 2907.38] We will suck at fighters, but I want to use them.
[2907.42 → 2910.12] I know, but I haven't done a proper unboxing of it yet.
[2910.20 → 2910.72] I don't want to open up both of them.
[2910.72 → 2911.82] Oh, so you need one?
[2912.04 → 2912.32] Yeah.
[2912.50 → 2912.80] Okay.
[2912.90 → 2914.56] I need one that's, like, still sealed.
[2914.56 → 2917.86] If you want, you can use this.
[2917.86 → 2919.92] And I'll use, like, an SNES controller.
[2920.84 → 2921.50] I'm down.
[2921.60 → 2922.74] We'll play, like, some Street Fighter.
[2922.96 → 2923.40] I'm down.
[2923.62 → 2923.86] Okay.
[2924.18 → 2924.44] Okay.
[2924.44 → 2925.72] He says, whelp.
[2925.72 → 2926.86] I can't fix it.
[2926.86 → 2928.96] But my idea is Thunderbolt on a phone.
[2928.96 → 2929.04] Okay.
[2929.04 → 2929.46] So, yeah.
[2929.46 → 2932.80] Thunderbolt on a phone is completely unnecessary.
[2933.12 → 2934.32] It's not a bad idea.
[2934.64 → 2940.72] It's just probably not going to happen for a good, you know, five years or however long.
[2940.72 → 2944.12] Because what's cool about Thunderbolt is the fact that it's so flexible.
[2944.12 → 2945.62] It carries display signalling.
[2945.94 → 2947.32] It carries data.
[2947.94 → 2949.72] It can be daisy-chained.
[2949.94 → 2958.76] So, you know, you could have Thunderbolt that goes out to your monitor, that goes out to all your peripherals, that goes out to all your storage, that goes out to your phone at the end of the day.
[2958.76 → 2964.46] Which is really cool, and it's a great idea, but it's not that low profile of a connector, actually.
[2964.60 → 2967.44] Mini DP has quite a bit of width and height to it.
[2967.48 → 2968.88] It's almost kind of square looking.
[2969.36 → 2983.80] And it's totally unnecessary for a phone because we are a long way away from storage that is cheap enough and small enough and compact enough to fit in a phone and to make sense for the cost of a phone
[2983.80 → 2989.52] that would be anywhere near leveraging the speeds that Thunderbolt is capable of delivering.
[2991.30 → 2999.62] And then the okay, so Jeff's comment is then because MHL wouldn't be needed at that point because Thunderbolt would be capable of both data and display.
[3000.14 → 3007.18] But, I mean, MHL is not a bad stopgap solution because it's capable of carrying both data and display.
[3007.18 → 3013.92] With the problem being that MHL is only USB 2, which is already in my mind basically a dead standard.
[3014.62 → 3021.48] And it upsets me to see Apple implementing things like the lightning bolt connector or whatever they call that stupid thing.
[3022.94 → 3026.66] That's still USB 2 at its backbone.
[3027.06 → 3030.34] So, there's sort of my take on all of that.
[3031.92 → 3033.68] This is compatible with PC, right?
[3034.08 → 3034.50] Yeah, of course.
[3034.50 → 3038.12] I only saw Xbox on the box and I only see Xbox here, so I was just making sure.
[3038.14 → 3038.46] Yeah, yeah.
[3038.60 → 3040.66] It's like an Xbox controller.
[3041.22 → 3041.96] It's PC compatible.
[3041.98 → 3042.32] Yeah, okay.
[3042.36 → 3043.66] Because the signalling is all Xbox.
[3044.02 → 3045.02] I assumed so.
[3045.10 → 3046.02] I just wanted to make sure.
[3048.58 → 3055.16] Jeff figures this would be useful on things like the Edge with the flip side being that, okay, it has insane storage on it,
[3055.16 → 3058.68] but it's still nowhere near what Thunderbolt would be capable of delivering.
[3058.78 → 3059.90] USB 3 would be fine.
[3060.56 → 3068.90] And the other issue is that Thunderbolt has power consumption constraints that are not going to be suitable for phone use for quite a while,
[3069.12 → 3072.38] in addition to the other problems like the bulkier connector and all that.
[3072.38 → 3073.64] So, I'm not saying you're wrong.
[3073.88 → 3081.02] I'm just saying we might be looking at, like, Thunderbolt 2 micro or something by the time that that's implemented on something like a phone.
[3081.30 → 3081.48] Yeah.
[3082.78 → 3083.98] What are we playing off of?
[3084.26 → 3086.04] We're going to play off of the MSI.
[3087.82 → 3089.60] We'll play a SNES game, I guess.
[3090.58 → 3091.68] Or we could fire up Steam.
[3091.74 → 3092.66] We could play Street Fighter 4.
[3093.76 → 3094.26] I'm down.
[3094.66 → 3095.06] You down?
[3095.22 → 3095.64] I'm down.
[3096.04 → 3096.38] You down?
[3096.38 → 3097.54] We both suck at fighters.
[3097.82 → 3098.38] I know, but we...
[3098.38 → 3099.66] Does it matter which one we play?
[3100.78 → 3101.38] Uh...
[3101.38 → 3103.20] Because, like, neither of us know.
[3103.96 → 3104.30] Yeah.
[3104.76 → 3106.28] I don't think it matters which one we play.
[3106.54 → 3107.04] You know what?
[3107.10 → 3111.88] Let's just go SNES and call it a day.
[3112.74 → 3114.88] So, we'll get some...
[3114.88 → 3117.86] We got Super Punch out here.
[3118.22 → 3118.82] Oh, hold on.
[3118.86 → 3120.54] I'm going to have to dust off another game here.
[3121.66 → 3123.70] So, let me just do that.
[3123.74 → 3124.70] Do you want to find another colour?
[3125.56 → 3125.96] Sure.
[3126.38 → 3127.56] Uh...
[3127.56 → 3127.92] Duh.
[3128.60 → 3129.10] All right.
[3129.16 → 3131.08] Thanks for joining us through text, Jeff.
[3131.12 → 3134.02] I'm sorry that you had some microphone difficulties over there.
[3134.86 → 3136.76] Jeff also apologizes for the mic.
[3136.88 → 3138.24] It brought home his point, though.
[3139.40 → 3140.30] Yeah, I know, right?
[3140.38 → 3141.18] It kind of worked.
[3141.56 → 3144.34] It's like shoddy connections need to just go away.
[3144.62 → 3145.22] All of them.
[3145.78 → 3147.88] They just go away.
[3148.38 → 3149.22] Whoa, is it working now?
[3149.52 → 3149.74] Yep.
[3150.82 → 3151.30] Lol.
[3151.76 → 3152.38] Oh, his mic?
[3152.48 → 3152.88] No, no, no.
[3152.96 → 3153.16] This.
[3153.16 → 3154.04] Oh, you're...
[3154.04 → 3154.58] Oh, you're...
[3154.58 → 3155.74] You're breaking things.
[3155.92 → 3156.06] Okay.
[3156.06 → 3156.60] No, I'm not.
[3157.04 → 3158.00] You plugged it in.
[3158.06 → 3158.62] It started working.
[3158.80 → 3159.68] I'm not breaking things.
[3159.78 → 3160.58] Plugged in your face.
[3161.16 → 3163.44] That's unfortunately not possible.
[3164.72 → 3166.02] Or if it was.
[3166.24 → 3168.00] Can't wait until we can, like, download information.
[3168.98 → 3169.98] I know, right?
[3169.98 → 3174.86] I want to learn riding a motorcycle at, like, a professional level.
[3175.02 → 3176.10] Don't let your mom hear that.
[3176.76 → 3178.72] At a professional level, so I wouldn't crash.
[3179.32 → 3180.70] Yeah, professionals crash.
[3181.16 → 3182.28] Sometimes they die.
[3182.28 → 3182.78] Shh.
[3182.78 → 3184.22] She doesn't watch it.
[3184.22 → 3184.24] She doesn't watch it.
[3186.58 → 3189.78] Yeah, but if you got into it, I'm not convinced that she wouldn't watch it.
[3192.06 → 3192.76] Touché, sir.
[3193.90 → 3195.06] She's starting to play Star Craft.
[3195.14 → 3195.88] Did I tell you about that?
[3196.26 → 3196.92] No way.
[3196.96 → 3197.88] I walked into...
[3197.88 → 3198.56] You want to play Star Craft?
[3198.56 → 3199.56] A hundred percent.
[3199.70 → 3202.16] And she's, like, really, really, really trying to learn.
[3202.48 → 3206.52] So we walk in, and there's, like, sheets of paper that she's printed out, which are her
[3206.52 → 3209.40] notes that she's taken in Word about things that...
[3209.40 → 3211.86] Mainly my brother, but my brother and I have told her over time.
[3211.86 → 3214.40] So she's, like, lifting buildings is a thing.
[3214.50 → 3215.24] You do it this way.
[3215.36 → 3216.14] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3216.52 → 3218.60] Select all the units.
[3218.70 → 3220.74] Put them in a group by pressing Control-1.
[3221.14 → 3223.56] And then move your screen somewhere.
[3223.88 → 3226.52] Press A and click for them to attack move in that direction.
[3226.66 → 3228.46] Like, she has, like, super notes on everything.
[3228.86 → 3229.98] She's going through the campaign.
[3230.38 → 3231.62] That is ridiculous.
[3231.62 → 3232.66] It's so awesome.
[3232.82 → 3233.82] She has build orders.
[3234.30 → 3235.76] She has, like, different strategies.
[3236.22 → 3239.46] She even has, like, things that she's theorizing all there on there.
[3239.46 → 3241.94] So she has, like, um, she plays Terran.
[3242.38 → 3245.14] So she has, like, uh, should I try going heavy air?
[3245.50 → 3246.64] Like, would that be a good idea?
[3247.20 → 3247.92] And it's, like, eh!
[3248.58 → 3249.40] It's awesome.
[3249.68 → 3250.20] That is hilarious.
[3250.20 → 3250.72] It's so cool.
[3252.66 → 3254.62] So, uh, how far into the campaign is she?
[3254.66 → 3256.10] You know what the irony is?
[3256.14 → 3258.18] Is that she's probably further into it than me.
[3258.24 → 3258.78] How far are you?
[3259.14 → 3260.72] I haven't started it, so...
[3260.72 → 3261.30] And she is.
[3261.36 → 3261.98] Yeah, she's...
[3261.98 → 3263.70] She has been successful on missions.
[3263.80 → 3265.40] I don't remember exactly what one she's on.
[3265.66 → 3267.42] But she's, like, actually doing okay.
[3268.10 → 3269.02] She's moving along.
[3269.02 → 3269.62] It's doing good.
[3269.88 → 3270.30] I watched her.
[3270.36 → 3272.36] She was playing a skirmish against a bot.
[3272.70 → 3274.50] Like, not a campaign mission.
[3274.92 → 3276.30] Just, like, a versus AI.
[3277.24 → 3281.36] Okay, that's pretty advanced compared to doing, like, a training campaign mission or whatever.
[3281.56 → 3282.12] Yep, yep.
[3282.86 → 3286.78] And she was winning against the setting she was on, which I don't remember what it was.
[3287.08 → 3288.74] But it was two base versus two base.
[3289.04 → 3292.66] And she had, like, 8,000 minerals and 6,000 gas.
[3293.38 → 3295.48] And 97 out of 200 supply.
[3296.38 → 3297.64] And I was like, you know what?
[3297.82 → 3302.84] But what she was focusing on was only building things using her keyboard macros.
[3303.50 → 3303.90] Okay.
[3303.90 → 3307.04] So she was only building units by pressing the button on her keyboard.
[3307.44 → 3310.30] And she was only selecting buildings by pressing the button on her keyboard.
[3310.56 → 3314.10] So basically she was practicing fundamentals, not actually trying to win the game.
[3314.10 → 3314.22] She was practicing fundamentals and mechanics.
[3314.50 → 3316.72] So when I saw that, I kind of giggled.
[3316.88 → 3318.68] But then was like, okay, what are you doing?
[3318.76 → 3320.70] And she explained that she was practicing her mechanics.
[3320.78 → 3321.92] And I was like, that's perfect.
[3322.74 → 3324.14] That's exactly what you want to do.
[3324.20 → 3328.70] Because having too much money isn't that big of a deal if you can't play the game properly.
[3329.44 → 3329.84] Right.
[3329.84 → 3333.30] So she's learning how to play the game properly first, which is so cool.
[3333.50 → 3334.84] That is absolutely edentulous.
[3335.54 → 3336.60] I love how gunshot she is.
[3336.82 → 3340.10] Then there's my dad trying to build a computer with hard copper pipes.
[3340.36 → 3343.60] And he's actually thinking about doing soft copper and hand bending it.
[3344.44 → 3344.88] Really?
[3345.02 → 3347.34] So that he can make, like, really nice curves and stuff.
[3348.18 → 3349.24] That would be kind of cool.
[3349.24 → 3349.88] Which is pretty cool.
[3352.24 → 3357.14] Okay, let's configure our game pads here.
[3357.14 → 3359.64] Because we have to take another run at this.
[3360.78 → 3361.18] Okay.
[3361.66 → 3361.92] Ready?
[3363.10 → 3363.60] Press up.
[3365.84 → 3367.10] Oh yeah, it's working.
[3367.50 → 3367.80] Down.
[3368.62 → 3369.08] Left.
[3369.86 → 3370.20] Right.
[3371.06 → 3371.46] Start.
[3372.24 → 3373.04] The side.
[3375.94 → 3376.46] Select.
[3378.60 → 3379.06] A.
[3380.20 → 3380.64] Nope.
[3381.10 → 3381.46] That was A.
[3381.56 → 3382.14] Wrong A though.
[3382.44 → 3383.34] Because it's different.
[3383.82 → 3384.28] A.
[3384.28 → 3386.92] B.
[3387.72 → 3388.12] X.
[3389.66 → 3390.06] Y.
[3390.36 → 3392.02] And then what do you want for, like, left and right?
[3392.12 → 3395.48] I mean, this isn't really, uh, this isn't really, okay, so left.
[3396.14 → 3397.06] Pick whatever you want.
[3397.16 → 3398.42] No, no, like, left shoulder.
[3399.36 → 3399.76] Oh.
[3400.26 → 3400.60] Yeah.
[3401.88 → 3402.50] I think.
[3402.78 → 3403.70] Yeah, these two.
[3403.80 → 3403.88] Yeah.
[3404.54 → 3405.98] Left and right.
[3405.98 → 3411.38] This isn't exactly an SNES optimized, uh, game device.
[3411.74 → 3412.48] It might be okay.
[3412.82 → 3413.48] Might be okay.
[3413.84 → 3416.46] Might also just be, like, devastating.
[3418.00 → 3418.48] Okay.
[3419.76 → 3420.12] So.
[3420.68 → 3422.22] Post questions in WAN open.
[3422.60 → 3424.02] Yeah, post questions in WAN open.
[3424.12 → 3425.82] We are still looking for live callers.
[3425.82 → 3427.88] Oh.
[3428.04 → 3428.84] This is kind of weird.
[3429.44 → 3430.52] I thought I, uh.
[3431.56 → 3433.34] I'm not scrolling up in the Windows Mall.
[3433.76 → 3433.94] So.
[3434.34 → 3434.92] Repost it.
[3439.60 → 3440.74] Oh, I see the problem.
[3441.22 → 3443.46] I have it set to not show desktop icons.
[3443.46 → 3443.78] So.
[3444.30 → 3445.88] I didn't see the right thing.
[3447.30 → 3447.74] Whoa.
[3448.00 → 3449.02] And there they go.
[3449.02 → 3457.58] I hate the touchpad on this computer.
[3457.88 → 3459.18] I need to reformat it.
[3460.14 → 3460.72] All right.
[3460.74 → 3461.54] I've got a few.
[3461.64 → 3462.88] I've got a few good ones here.
[3464.28 → 3464.52] Uh.
[3464.76 → 3465.18] No.
[3465.54 → 3466.78] Now it's going too quickly.
[3468.70 → 3469.18] No.
[3472.06 → 3472.80] All right.
[3473.06 → 3474.14] Let's see if, uh.
[3474.20 → 3475.26] Let's see if this is working.
[3475.70 → 3476.92] Because I have no idea.
[3477.86 → 3478.18] Okay.
[3478.18 → 3479.12] I got someone.
[3479.60 → 3480.00] Um.
[3480.08 → 3481.86] There was a few perfect questions in a row.
[3482.02 → 3483.16] And I just grabbed a name.
[3483.30 → 3485.10] So I'm not actually entirely sure which one this is.
[3485.50 → 3486.80] But I've added you to the list.
[3490.94 → 3491.66] There's actually a.
[3491.80 → 3493.48] After I said post your questions again.
[3493.56 → 3494.80] There are a bunch of perfect questions.
[3494.94 → 3495.44] Sorry guys.
[3495.52 → 3496.28] We'll try and get to you.
[3496.80 → 3498.98] Were there any questions about dangers and raising them?
[3499.12 → 3500.34] There wasn't, actually.
[3500.46 → 3500.62] Wow.
[3500.68 → 3501.20] I'm impressed.
[3501.44 → 3501.82] Me too.
[3503.32 → 3503.68] Okay.
[3504.08 → 3504.44] Settings.
[3505.14 → 3505.88] Let's, uh.
[3506.44 → 3507.48] Let's crop that.
[3508.18 → 3509.98] So crop that bottom.
[3509.98 → 3512.90] Crop that left.
[3514.64 → 3515.10] Oops.
[3515.44 → 3516.50] Wrong, wrong left crop.
[3517.28 → 3518.14] Crop that right.
[3519.42 → 3519.82] Hmm.
[3520.06 → 3520.68] That was weird.
[3522.16 → 3522.68] Okay.
[3523.06 → 3524.58] So I'm not kind of like that.
[3525.26 → 3527.12] Kind of like that.
[3528.40 → 3529.28] Kind of like.
[3529.64 → 3529.98] Oops.
[3530.06 → 3530.74] Not like that.
[3530.74 → 3534.50] You know what actually really annoys me?
[3535.04 → 3535.26] What?
[3535.66 → 3536.10] That.
[3537.20 → 3538.00] You say it.
[3538.28 → 3539.16] All the time.
[3539.40 → 3539.74] I know.
[3540.00 → 3540.06] I know.
[3540.06 → 3542.22] You say it literally more than anyone I know.
[3542.34 → 3544.12] Pretty, probably everyone I know combined.
[3544.36 → 3545.40] I think you still say it more.
[3546.32 → 3547.70] It's, that doesn't make it not annoying.
[3548.54 → 3549.92] Did you say that doesn't make it?
[3550.34 → 3550.74] Yeah.
[3550.74 → 3554.04] So do you annoy yourself?
[3554.58 → 3555.10] Sometimes.
[3556.02 → 3559.42] Does that make you essayistic?
[3559.68 → 3561.12] I'm just, wait, what?
[3561.96 → 3562.52] Why?
[3562.68 → 3564.34] Why did you have to take it there?
[3564.46 → 3566.18] I try to keep things appropriate.
[3571.54 → 3572.06] Oops.
[3572.58 → 3572.84] Sorry.
[3572.98 → 3573.16] Yeah.
[3573.26 → 3573.66] We're good.
[3573.70 → 3574.08] We're back.
[3574.08 → 3578.68] So let's, let's move this up.
[3579.14 → 3580.26] And then same thing.
[3580.32 → 3581.20] I got to do the cropping.
[3581.70 → 3585.26] We, we had some problems with the way that this was set up.
[3585.36 → 3587.00] So we had to change things.
[3587.24 → 3593.82] Basically, the problem was that diesel and slick just completely wrecked everything that
[3593.82 → 3595.88] I had worked so hard to set up correctly.
[3597.06 → 3599.20] You guys totally did.
[3599.52 → 3600.04] Nope.
[3600.70 → 3601.14] Whatever.
[3601.78 → 3603.98] The next week we came back, and it was screwed up again.
[3603.98 → 3604.92] And we hadn't touched it.
[3605.16 → 3606.54] So I'm pretty sure it wasn't use.
[3606.90 → 3609.74] I'm pretty sure that you don't know what you're talking about.
[3610.26 → 3614.00] And I'm pretty sure that if your mom's watching this, she's going to give me a hard time for
[3614.00 → 3614.36] like being mean to you.
[3614.36 → 3616.64] It's recorded in the last live stream.
[3616.72 → 3618.46] You go, oh, what happened to scene one?
[3619.72 → 3621.06] Why doesn't scene one work?
[3622.20 → 3622.90] I don't know, Linus.
[3622.90 → 3625.58] I'm pretty sure it's recorded that you admitted to breaking it.
[3626.12 → 3626.52] Nope.
[3626.64 → 3628.34] I'm pretty sure that that's how I remember it.
[3629.14 → 3630.74] Pretty sure you remember it wrong.
[3630.74 → 3634.22] And it's not about remembering because it's recorded.
[3634.56 → 3635.76] Slick mom in the Twitch chat.
[3635.84 → 3636.70] I am watching.
[3637.34 → 3637.74] Boom.
[3641.10 → 3641.78] All right.
[3641.94 → 3643.96] And yes, Slick mom is really Slick's mom.
[3644.36 → 3644.68] Yes.
[3644.68 → 3645.08] Hi, mom.
[3645.44 → 3646.22] Yes, definitely.
[3647.10 → 3647.48] Okay.
[3647.92 → 3648.58] Is your...
[3648.58 → 3649.20] Are you player one?
[3652.42 → 3653.22] Your player one.
[3653.94 → 3654.42] Wait, what?
[3654.66 → 3655.08] It's not.
[3655.08 → 3655.78] Oh, yeah.
[3655.84 → 3656.22] You have to...
[3656.22 → 3656.72] You have to...
[3656.72 → 3657.46] Yeah, it's working.
[3658.12 → 3659.50] But you have to pick the right thing.
[3660.32 → 3662.38] Someone is in the RazerConf channel.
[3663.16 → 3663.82] Oh, are they?
[3664.14 → 3664.40] Hello!
[3664.94 → 3665.78] He's not...
[3665.78 → 3667.26] Dude, click the headset button.
[3667.36 → 3667.80] Top left.
[3670.10 → 3670.54] Yes.
[3671.82 → 3672.22] Nope.
[3672.70 → 3673.26] That's Wind speed.
[3673.38 → 3674.16] He's chilling.
[3674.92 → 3675.40] What's up, Wind speed?
[3681.40 → 3681.64] Hello?
[3681.64 → 3681.84] Hello?
[3682.18 → 3682.62] Hello.
[3683.26 → 3683.70] Hi.
[3683.70 → 3684.90] Hi, guys.
[3685.78 → 3687.24] I had a couple questions.
[3687.38 → 3690.52] Number one, I'm from NCS Systems.
[3690.98 → 3691.46] We...
[3691.46 → 3694.94] Me and Linus have to talk because, you know, PAX coming up soon.
[3695.30 → 3700.98] But what kind of meetups are you guys going to do at PAX and CES soon?
[3701.08 → 3702.02] What are you planning to do?
[3703.80 → 3704.76] At PAX?
[3704.78 → 3707.64] I don't know if we had any particular meetup planned.
[3707.78 → 3713.68] Although I did have a conversation with Western Digital today where they wanted us to talk to
[3713.68 → 3721.50] users at PAX about why they have the storage configurations that they do.
[3721.50 → 3728.74] So it's not so much that they're interested in what storage configs they have, but more they want to hear the justification.
[3729.74 → 3730.00] Okay.
[3730.00 → 3734.20] So, like, why do you have two hard drives in your computer?
[3734.66 → 3735.66] Why do you have one?
[3736.22 → 3737.46] Apparently, I have the stream.
[3737.46 → 3738.08] It's his stream.
[3738.08 → 3739.32] Oh.
[3739.32 → 3739.36] Oh.
[3739.60 → 3739.96] Okay.
[3740.04 → 3740.44] It's not me.
[3741.32 → 3744.78] And why do you have an SSD versus a hard drive?
[3744.90 → 3745.98] Were you willing to spend more?
[3746.24 → 3749.60] So that might be something that would be interesting to have a meetup about.
[3749.60 → 3750.32] I am using speakers.
[3750.58 → 3751.18] That's a problem.
[3751.88 → 3752.10] Yeah.
[3752.10 → 3757.18] I am using speakers.
[3757.30 → 3757.78] I apologize.
[3758.92 → 3765.86] Any just particular fan meetups that you plan on doing at CES more likely?
[3767.24 → 3767.88] CES.
[3768.06 → 3770.10] CES is, like, pretty far away.
[3771.52 → 3772.36] I don't even...
[3772.36 → 3774.90] We haven't even talked to any potential sponsors about it yet.
[3774.96 → 3776.10] I mean, we're probably going.
[3776.10 → 3783.16] I don't imagine that we won't be going, but it's still very early planning stages right now.
[3783.24 → 3783.72] Okay.
[3784.40 → 3784.76] So...
[3784.76 → 3786.30] Thank you, guys.
[3786.32 → 3786.84] CES is insane.
[3787.30 → 3787.44] Yeah.
[3788.68 → 3793.40] Again, I have to get back to Linus with an email or so, because I've been emailing you,
[3793.76 → 3796.52] you know, pretty legit earlier in the year.
[3796.88 → 3798.24] But thanks, guys.
[3798.60 → 3799.52] Oh, it's you!
[3800.12 → 3800.56] Yeah!
[3801.36 → 3801.66] Oh.
[3802.18 → 3805.54] Sorry, I was only half paying attention, because I was trying to get the game working.
[3806.10 → 3807.90] Yeah, it's me.
[3809.24 → 3809.78] All right.
[3809.82 → 3811.36] Yeah, we'll have to figure something out.
[3811.96 → 3812.32] All right.
[3812.72 → 3813.28] Let me know.
[3813.86 → 3814.36] All right.
[3814.40 → 3814.54] Cool.
[3814.68 → 3815.10] Thank you.
[3816.50 → 3817.92] I'm so intrigued now.
[3818.12 → 3819.18] I'll tell you about it after.
[3819.40 → 3819.62] Okay.
[3821.84 → 3822.32] All right.
[3822.44 → 3823.84] We're gaming now, or am I grabbing someone else?
[3824.46 → 3825.16] I don't know.
[3825.44 → 3828.94] I was going to try, but it doesn't look like my controller is being picked up by the game,
[3829.00 → 3829.88] so I don't know what's going on.
[3830.32 → 3831.90] Maybe it's because you didn't pick Versus.
[3831.98 → 3832.58] Oh, is it this one?
[3832.90 → 3833.60] No, it's not.
[3833.60 → 3837.66] Because I configured it within the Dusted Off SNES.
[3838.58 → 3842.12] So here, I'm just going to do, I'm just going to reset the machine.
[3842.12 → 3842.88] I didn't pick anything.
[3843.08 → 3843.70] Yeah, you did.
[3844.18 → 3844.40] What?
[3844.74 → 3846.90] Yeah, you selected a particular game mode.
[3848.36 → 3849.32] Did you do it?
[3849.62 → 3849.88] Nope.
[3851.00 → 3852.04] You pressed, like, start.
[3852.68 → 3853.74] So game start, see?
[3853.94 → 3855.58] Oh, I didn't know you changed it there.
[3855.88 → 3856.18] Yeah.
[3856.44 → 3857.06] That's weird.
[3857.18 → 3858.40] So it's Versus Battle, right?
[3858.54 → 3859.14] Cool, yeah.
[3859.14 → 3862.64] Yeah, so now I probably will actually have control.
[3862.86 → 3863.42] I can move.
[3864.24 → 3865.02] I can't.
[3865.80 → 3866.68] That's kind of weird.
[3867.34 → 3868.42] I'm okay with this.
[3869.08 → 3872.92] With me just not having any control of anything?
[3874.60 → 3877.04] With my competency in fighting games, you might still win.
[3877.04 → 3881.58] If you can, like, take damage personally for how bad you're playing.
[3883.12 → 3885.00] I could just kill myself trying to fight you.
[3886.36 → 3889.04] Oh, it looks like mine wasn't programmed correctly.
[3889.34 → 3889.80] What a fool.
[3889.80 → 3894.06] So that would have boded well for your success.
[3894.60 → 3897.22] So you've never played with a fight stick before, right?
[3897.34 → 3897.50] Nope.
[3898.20 → 3899.02] All right, here we go.
[3899.10 → 3899.68] Not even in an arcade.
[3900.92 → 3901.76] I've seen them in arcades.
[3901.84 → 3902.38] I've played other games.
[3902.44 → 3905.42] And I've played games that aren't fighting games with these type of setups.
[3906.42 → 3907.44] Bring it on, smart guy.
[3909.02 → 3911.16] Do we have another live caller potentially lined up?
[3911.76 → 3912.12] Potentially?
[3912.28 → 3913.74] There were a lot of perfect questions.
[3913.98 → 3914.26] Okay.
[3914.60 → 3918.94] Why don't I try to do a Twitter blitz while I fight you?
[3918.94 → 3919.50] All right.
[3919.50 → 3920.00] Okay.
[3920.62 → 3921.96] So, guys, hit me on Twitter.
[3924.22 → 3927.12] Someone says name as many of the U.S. states as you can.
[3927.66 → 3928.92] Well, there's...
[3928.92 → 3929.26] America?
[3929.70 → 3930.72] I don't care.
[3931.40 → 3933.34] And it doesn't matter.
[3933.92 → 3934.82] And there's...
[3934.82 → 3935.84] I live north of there.
[3937.86 → 3940.94] Name as many provinces and territories as you can.
[3941.04 → 3941.52] Yeah.
[3942.20 → 3944.46] Name as many Canadian provinces as you can.
[3944.54 → 3946.28] That's my challenge.
[3946.38 → 3946.74] Whoa!
[3947.30 → 3947.78] Was that me?
[3947.98 → 3948.48] Was that you?
[3948.48 → 3950.20] I think I'm the one on the left.
[3950.52 → 3950.72] Yeah.
[3952.62 → 3955.24] I just kicked you in the ankles, which is, like, awesome.
[3955.76 → 3958.38] Then I, like, slid and kicked you with both feet in the ankle.
[3959.26 → 3960.12] Am I dead already?
[3960.24 → 3961.06] Wow, this is ridiculous.
[3961.26 → 3962.60] Okay, I'm going back to my Twitter blitz.
[3962.66 → 3963.36] I like this.
[3963.36 → 3967.96] Not sure if this has been asked, but do you think that gigabit internet will enable more intense DDoS attacks?
[3968.02 → 3971.28] We actually did talk about this topic not that long ago on the live stream.
[3971.28 → 3979.24] But even if that is possible, I don't think a lot can be done to prevent it.
[3979.24 → 3981.24] Because it's, like...
[3981.24 → 3984.38] Yeah, you can't just stop technology from moving forward.
[3984.88 → 3988.30] If that was a thing, we wouldn't have cars because of how many accidents they caused.
[3988.30 → 3992.22] Yeah, because they allow people to, like, go faster and have more accidents.
[3993.02 → 3993.40] Oh.
[3995.62 → 3997.20] Oh, that's so ridiculous.
[3997.68 → 3998.48] What do I do?
[3999.28 → 4000.32] What do I do?
[4000.58 → 4000.98] Yeah.
[4001.60 → 4002.54] Oh, but you're not dead yet.
[4003.42 → 4003.64] Oh.
[4003.90 → 4004.22] Whoa.
[4004.22 → 4004.58] Whoa.
[4006.94 → 4007.34] Yeah!
[4007.34 → 4007.66] No!
[4007.66 → 4010.38] Sliding with my back along the floor.
[4011.12 → 4012.06] Someone says, poke Slick.
[4012.30 → 4012.72] There you go.
[4013.14 → 4013.52] All right.
[4014.06 → 4018.10] If I do it for every time I've been told to on the stream so far, I could probably sit here for an hour.
[4018.40 → 4020.34] Someone says, I ordered the custom one pro.
[4020.54 → 4023.78] Slick, did you burn in slash break yours in?
[4023.92 → 4024.18] Yes.
[4024.38 → 4025.18] What did you use?
[4025.80 → 4026.24] Pink noise?
[4026.62 → 4027.34] A...
[4027.34 → 4029.52] I don't remember the name of it, but very possibly.
[4029.52 → 4032.36] It was one of those, like, things that you're supposed to use.
[4033.08 → 4033.40] Okay.
[4034.52 → 4037.26] So did you do that before listening to them at all?
[4038.20 → 4038.60] Yes.
[4040.54 → 4041.40] This is awesome.
[4041.90 → 4043.86] I'm just going to keep, like, kicking you in the chin.
[4043.98 → 4044.26] I don't know.
[4046.28 → 4046.60] Whoa!
[4048.02 → 4048.34] No!
[4050.46 → 4051.68] I'm going for perfection.
[4051.90 → 4052.72] So much for your fights.
[4052.88 → 4053.08] Oh.
[4055.00 → 4056.60] It's all about the ground slide.
[4056.60 → 4057.02] I don't think that's the problem.
[4062.20 → 4063.44] Oh, lame.
[4064.14 → 4065.38] Throws do so much damage.
[4065.50 → 4066.04] It's not fair.
[4066.04 → 4070.86] It's like you get to hit me, and then the floor gets to hit me, and then, like, your dog gets to hit me.
[4070.86 → 4073.64] Well, your leg gets to hit me, and then I don't get to do anything, so I just kind of fair.
[4074.26 → 4074.62] Wow!
[4075.08 → 4076.66] It does, like, no damage.
[4076.74 → 4077.90] But it's so annoying.
[4077.90 → 4081.72] Oh, my laptop battery just died.
[4081.72 → 4082.28] Whoa.
[4082.72 → 4083.82] I made it this far.
[4083.82 → 4085.18] Oh, you don't have to plug it in.
[4085.48 → 4086.42] It's fully charged.
[4086.50 → 4087.14] It'll be fine.
[4087.22 → 4088.38] I have an extended battery.
[4088.52 → 4089.70] It wasn't fully charged.
[4089.82 → 4092.92] It only had three bars out of five on the battery.
[4093.24 → 4093.46] Oh.
[4093.56 → 4094.74] Oh, I totally won.
[4094.74 → 4099.82] I think that's the first time I've won one of our fighting game matches in a while, actually.
[4100.02 → 4100.64] Yeah, I think so.
[4100.64 → 4103.86] Because you were kicking my butt pretty badly for a bit there.
[4104.00 → 4105.46] And we suck, so, like...
[4105.46 → 4106.16] Yeah, I know.
[4107.24 → 4108.62] What all is plugged in here?
[4108.82 → 4111.02] Okay, so the gaming laptop is plugged in here.
[4111.34 → 4113.74] So I'm going to go ahead and swap that one out.
[4114.02 → 4120.42] And then maybe we'll just, like, we'll say if we actually run out of battery on the gaming laptop, then the after party's over.
[4120.68 → 4122.78] I've got to go home and make dinner at some point anyway.
[4122.78 → 4124.78] Okay, so, uh...
[4125.32 → 4125.84] Yeah.
[4126.34 → 4127.96] If you want to line up another live...
[4127.96 → 4129.78] Are you changing your knob?
[4129.96 → 4130.40] Yeah, dog.
[4131.98 → 4136.48] I mean, is it, like, bad that your mom's watching this, and I'm talking about your knob?
[4136.80 → 4141.56] No, because you're obviously talking about the controller that I'm using right now and not anything else.
[4141.70 → 4141.98] Right.
[4143.14 → 4144.46] Everyone sane knows that.
[4144.90 → 4145.50] That's true.
[4145.84 → 4147.62] But I never really claimed to be sane.
[4149.06 → 4150.94] Okay, uh, someone asks on Twitter,
[4150.94 → 4152.44] New kid coming or not?
[4153.10 → 4154.22] Um, not.
[4154.64 → 4154.86] Oh.
[4154.86 → 4159.74] But at some point, uh, it's in the plan and not that long from now.
[4159.92 → 4161.80] So this way you can say that there weren't a mistake?
[4162.06 → 4165.22] Charles asks, your thoughts on the MacBook Air and Macs in general?
[4165.38 → 4167.48] I think the MacBook Air is an outstanding machine.
[4167.92 → 4169.68] I mean, particularly the...
[4169.68 → 4172.16] You know, I think I put the screwdriver in wrong before.
[4172.36 → 4172.62] Oh, no.
[4172.76 → 4173.48] I mean, that's not it.
[4173.74 → 4174.56] Oh, it's just this thing.
[4174.88 → 4176.18] Yeah, but it was in there.
[4176.18 → 4180.18] I think particularly the latest generation MacBook Air with...
[4180.18 → 4183.08] Apple just targets the right things sometimes.
[4183.08 → 4188.06] So they kind of go, like, what's wrong with the MacBook Air?
[4189.14 → 4191.58] Well, people keep wanting more battery life.
[4191.92 → 4193.36] Let's deliver more battery life.
[4193.40 → 4194.04] And they did that.
[4194.14 → 4196.68] So it gets, like, a ludicrous battery life.
[4196.76 → 4197.70] It's powerful enough.
[4197.76 → 4198.76] It's super lightweight.
[4198.76 → 4201.68] I am sold on this form factor.
[4201.88 → 4206.42] So this is an Aspire S7, which is a similar sort of idea to the MacBook Air.
[4206.42 → 4207.86] Except that you have a giant battery on the bottom.
[4208.02 → 4210.50] Except there's, like, a weird giant battery pack on the bottom.
[4210.56 → 4213.92] And I still get, like, two-thirds of the battery life of the new MacBook Air.
[4214.00 → 4215.16] I'd love to have a MacBook Air.
[4216.06 → 4217.98] Do you recommend antivirus software anymore?
[4218.18 → 4219.32] If so, which one?
[4219.88 → 4221.06] Malwarebytes is outstanding.
[4221.56 → 4223.88] Malwarebytes is outstanding for its one-time scan.
[4224.22 → 4224.88] Like, incredible.
[4225.04 → 4227.58] If you think you have a virus, download Malwarebytes and run it.
[4227.58 → 4232.20] If you don't want to spend any money, Microsoft Security Essentials is surprisingly okay.
[4232.76 → 4233.04] Yeah.
[4233.30 → 4238.64] Security Essentials, actually, the last report I read about it had it going down the tubes a little bit.
[4239.10 → 4241.00] But for a long time, it was perfect.
[4241.46 → 4241.88] Oh, no.
[4241.96 → 4243.00] You're the same person, aren't you?
[4243.04 → 4243.58] No, I'm Lanka.
[4243.76 → 4244.08] Okay.
[4244.54 → 4245.42] Are we both big dudes?
[4245.50 → 4246.20] We're both big dudes.
[4247.82 → 4248.18] Yeah.
[4248.72 → 4249.54] It's all about the kick.
[4251.46 → 4253.48] It's all about the like, backflip, apparently.
[4254.34 → 4254.70] Okay.
[4254.70 → 4257.90] I'm going to try to take a Twitter question in the middle of a battle here.
[4258.04 → 4260.36] So, just going to kick you in the shin in the meantime.
[4260.48 → 4260.78] Wow.
[4261.02 → 4266.98] Do you know anything about Razor Core causing Sods related to RM?
[4267.66 → 4268.12] Oh, no.
[4268.20 → 4268.62] Stop it.
[4269.06 → 4270.18] I'm totally going to win.
[4270.50 → 4270.86] Probably.
[4271.02 → 4272.04] I can't guess to you.
[4272.18 → 4272.78] That's insane.
[4272.80 → 4273.66] It happened to me in there.
[4273.74 → 4274.44] Threads on the forum.
[4274.56 → 4274.74] Sorry.
[4274.82 → 4276.30] I don't know anything about it.
[4276.36 → 4277.18] Have you seen that?
[4277.58 → 4277.96] Blue screen?
[4277.96 → 4279.60] I have my...
[4279.60 → 4283.34] Oh, you have a bug report from something that was causing blue screens on your system.
[4283.48 → 4286.10] So, yes, it is still very much beta, guys.
[4287.26 → 4291.48] I, to be completely transparent, I can't actually run it on my own desktop right now.
[4291.74 → 4292.14] It's impossible.
[4292.24 → 4292.54] Really?
[4292.90 → 4293.92] So, it stopped working entirely?
[4293.92 → 4294.64] Reinstalling anything.
[4294.64 → 4296.44] I think it might be a registry thing.
[4297.18 → 4297.58] Oh, okay.
[4297.58 → 4302.82] So, I'm going to hunt through the registry to find it because I found its uninstaller is not all that clean.
[4303.88 → 4304.28] Oh.
[4304.72 → 4313.62] So, I think it's leaving traces, and then it's leaving traces of whatever that weird bug is that's, like, trying to read something off a drive that doesn't exist with some really crazy folder names.
[4313.86 → 4322.12] Because I've had that kind of problem before where I have to just, like, search for every possible related word in the registry to correctly actually remove a program.
[4322.90 → 4326.12] And, um, it's extremely obnoxious.
[4326.22 → 4327.14] Come on, come on, come on.
[4327.58 → 4327.98] Yeah!
[4328.92 → 4330.72] The timing on that was insane.
[4330.74 → 4332.08] They can't even see what we're doing.
[4332.34 → 4332.52] Oops.
[4332.72 → 4334.56] I kicked them in the ankle to win.
[4335.32 → 4340.04] But, um, yeah, there are, there are some issues with comes still, very much.
[4340.40 → 4340.60] Yeah.
[4340.76 → 4345.00] And I'll hunt it down in the registry, and I'll fix it, and it'll be fixed for the official release, I'm sure.
[4345.00 → 4348.68] But, uh, Brian asks, I need some professional advice.
[4348.88 → 4356.58] For $130 Canadian, what's better, a used 2012 Nexus 7 or a used HP touchpad?
[4356.58 → 4358.12] I couldn't change my guy.
[4359.98 → 4361.90] I would go use Nexus 7.
[4362.40 → 4363.58] Over an HP touchpad?
[4363.72 → 4364.02] Yeah.
[4365.08 → 4365.44] Yeah.
[4365.44 → 4370.76] I mean, it's one thing to have unofficial support, but it's quite an...
[4370.76 → 4372.86] Wow, I'm kind of going down here.
[4373.50 → 4378.68] But it's quite another to have official support for the long term for a product that you're using.
[4378.68 → 4383.50] Even if it's not warranty, like having software support is kind of a big deal.
[4383.76 → 4387.74] That's why Nexus in general is very highly recommended by at least myself.
[4388.84 → 4389.52] Oh, no.
[4389.64 → 4391.10] You're going to just do that all day?
[4391.46 → 4391.76] Really?
[4393.38 → 4393.82] Wow.
[4394.22 → 4395.74] It's great because you can't dodge it.
[4396.30 → 4396.74] What?
[4397.26 → 4398.26] Well, you can't.
[4398.38 → 4398.68] Right.
[4398.68 → 4399.48] I mean, people can.
[4401.10 → 4401.46] Yes.
[4404.34 → 4404.70] Wow.
[4405.48 → 4406.30] That's so lame.
[4406.36 → 4407.32] See, I don't know anything.
[4407.70 → 4409.18] So the fact that you know that move...
[4409.18 → 4410.34] No, no, I fluke into that one.
[4410.46 → 4410.76] Oh, really?
[4410.92 → 4411.14] Yeah.
[4411.22 → 4411.82] That's pretty cool.
[4413.08 → 4416.72] Install the side in 240M and now my PC won't post.
[4417.60 → 4418.54] Any suggestions?
[4418.72 → 4419.96] Wow, you're going to be like that about it?
[4420.72 → 4421.82] You were just...
[4421.82 → 4423.26] See, you always do that.
[4423.76 → 4426.24] You do something, and then I do it, and then you're like, wow.
[4428.20 → 4429.34] Can I beat you without looking?
[4430.00 → 4431.42] Well, I don't know.
[4431.56 → 4432.74] Can you beat me at all?
[4433.96 → 4435.48] Can you effectively beat me?
[4438.18 → 4440.36] He thinks he's going to beat me without looking over there.
[4440.90 → 4442.90] You had no idea what was going on.
[4442.98 → 4444.04] I was still doing pretty okay.
[4446.56 → 4446.92] Yes.
[4448.62 → 4449.68] That's so lame.
[4450.48 → 4451.68] That's so lame.
[4452.68 → 4453.80] Oh, wait, you're still alive?
[4454.58 → 4454.92] Crap.
[4455.44 → 4455.74] Yes.
[4456.06 → 4459.14] The amount of games that we've had where it's super low.
[4459.40 → 4460.00] I know.
[4460.20 → 4461.02] It's actually kind of nuts.
[4461.10 → 4463.52] Like there have been times when I was pretty sure that I was dead,
[4463.60 → 4464.42] but it didn't happen.
[4464.48 → 4465.40] Yeah, that's kind of insane.
[4465.52 → 4468.78] If you install a liquid cooler and your system is all of a sudden
[4468.78 → 4473.34] not working anymore, there is a very good chance that bad things happened
[4473.34 → 4478.78] and something happened like you shorted something out
[4478.78 → 4482.28] or accidentally broke a trace while you were doing something.
[4482.28 → 4485.96] The good news is that shorts can sometimes be dealt with
[4485.96 → 4491.06] simply by taking apart the computer and then reassembling it.
[4491.06 → 4493.84] Also, make sure that your mount is good.
[4496.12 → 4497.66] Yeah, make sure you mount it real good.
[4498.86 → 4499.52] It's important.
[4500.22 → 4500.52] It is.
[4502.16 → 4503.20] I don't know which one I am.
[4504.02 → 4504.70] I'm the chick.
[4504.70 → 4504.96] That one.
[4505.92 → 4507.16] Whoa, she's fast.
[4508.02 → 4509.18] Haha, Chung for the win.
[4509.20 → 4509.70] I'm like, I'm fast, too.
[4511.16 → 4512.72] Chung versus Belong.
[4513.82 → 4514.20] Sweet.
[4514.20 → 4514.42] Holy crap.
[4515.08 → 4515.82] How do I do that?
[4516.52 → 4517.08] There we go.
[4517.08 → 4519.16] I try doing, like, combos.
[4519.42 → 4520.08] Nothing ever happens.
[4521.56 → 4522.76] You've got to be more random.
[4523.96 → 4524.62] There we go.
[4524.68 → 4525.02] Wow.
[4525.18 → 4528.58] I am, like, figuring out one move for, like, every guy.
[4528.72 → 4529.88] I can't figure out anything.
[4530.14 → 4531.24] I was doing it.
[4531.36 → 4533.80] That time I was going, maybe I shouldn't start with up.
[4534.04 → 4535.06] I've been mainly starting with up.
[4535.92 → 4536.20] All right.
[4537.52 → 4540.68] I think for her leg thing, yeah, you just mashed the kick button.
[4541.08 → 4541.60] Really?
[4542.08 → 4545.24] Oh, old games.
[4545.66 → 4546.86] How awesome are you?
[4546.86 → 4548.84] Mine gets nothing from Magic the Kick-Fight.
[4548.98 → 4549.54] What about Punch?
[4551.30 → 4552.50] Nope, I just lose.
[4553.02 → 4553.36] Wow.
[4553.80 → 4555.40] I'm on a roll here for Street Fighter.
[4555.46 → 4556.00] I love this.
[4556.26 → 4561.62] So, it looks like for all the advancements that have been made in the last, like, ten years
[4561.62 → 4564.48] in controllers, SNES controller.
[4565.84 → 4566.94] Still a boss.
[4567.88 → 4568.94] Or is that I just suck?
[4569.72 → 4575.22] For some reason, I'm not able to view the Twitch chat right now, so I'm just going to try this again.
[4575.22 → 4580.00] Is, are we actually able to navigate to Twitch.tv now?
[4580.86 → 4581.70] Who's Tammy?
[4582.30 → 4582.96] I don't know.
[4583.96 → 4585.90] Do you think she ever made a...
[4585.90 → 4586.40] Cameo?
[4586.44 → 4587.02] Cameo.
[4587.52 → 4587.68] Yeah.
[4587.76 → 4588.28] Well, come on.
[4588.32 → 4589.34] Let me make my joke.
[4589.44 → 4589.68] No.
[4590.62 → 4591.58] My jokes are good.
[4591.58 → 4593.14] They're all too straightforward.
[4595.04 → 4595.72] Oh, crap.
[4595.84 → 4596.34] I was still...
[4596.34 → 4597.12] It's funny.
[4597.22 → 4600.10] I was like, how much time do I have to look back at the screen?
[4600.30 → 4605.24] And I was looking at me monitoring the Twitch stream on my laptop, and I was like, oh, we're
[4605.24 → 4606.14] still in the character selection.
[4606.26 → 4607.18] No, we're not.
[4607.18 → 4610.46] Because you're going to be like that about it, apparently.
[4610.88 → 4611.28] What?
[4611.50 → 4612.54] What am I even doing?
[4612.78 → 4614.30] You started before I was looking.
[4614.50 → 4615.42] You knew I wasn't looking.
[4615.42 → 4616.76] You've done that more than once to me.
[4616.82 → 4617.76] You realize that, right?
[4617.92 → 4621.26] I think that what you need to do is just be reasonable about it.
[4621.64 → 4622.78] What would this be?
[4622.88 → 4623.14] Nothing.
[4623.38 → 4623.54] Okay.
[4624.26 → 4625.26] Trying to do full circles.
[4625.26 → 4626.32] Just rotating your knob.
[4627.66 → 4628.10] Pressing...
[4628.10 → 4630.08] I can't get any form of special ability.
[4631.02 → 4632.30] I've tried a lot of different things.
[4632.36 → 4632.96] This is so weird.
[4633.04 → 4635.90] Twitch chat's just completely not working for me, so I'm going back to Twitter.
[4635.90 → 4639.32] At least Twitter is relatively reliable, sort of.
[4639.84 → 4643.48] Why do we not see more small form factor, high power graphics?
[4644.08 → 4644.58] You know what?
[4644.64 → 4645.78] I think that's a good question.
[4645.92 → 4651.28] I think Asus is the only one that's really done anything with the 670 Direct 2 Mini
[4651.28 → 4652.16] or whatever it was.
[4652.50 → 4654.66] And there are a couple of things that I think affect this.
[4654.66 → 4656.84] So number one is I don't think we really need it.
[4657.18 → 4662.92] Look at how small even, like, full-fledged graphics cards are these days.
[4662.92 → 4670.88] Like, if you liquid cool a stock 670, I mean, that's about as small form factor as it gets.
[4670.88 → 4682.54] And I think that it's not that hard, really, for the case manufacturers to just build in the space for that
[4682.54 → 4684.26] because it doesn't make the case that big.
[4684.32 → 4685.54] I mean, look at an FT-03 Mini.
[4688.52 → 4689.74] Oh, we've picked the same guy.
[4689.94 → 4690.34] That's cool.
[4691.34 → 4691.58] Did we?
[4691.58 → 4695.10] And then why, okay.
[4695.42 → 4698.84] So specifically, he's talking about half height, which is kind of interesting.
[4699.44 → 4704.34] So the reason I think we don't see more half height for things like 770 and 780
[4704.34 → 4709.80] is going to be thermal constraints as well as heat constraints.
[4710.02 → 4715.92] So there's only so much you can do to dissipate the heat away from something.
[4715.98 → 4718.74] And the smaller you make it, the less room you have to do that.
[4718.74 → 4722.90] So when you make something small form factor, you're making it more difficult to cool.
[4723.02 → 4724.00] Yeah, you finally went around.
[4724.12 → 4724.96] No, look at the hope bars.
[4725.28 → 4727.02] Oh, yeah, they're, like, completely out.
[4727.48 → 4730.16] There's no actual yellow there.
[4731.76 → 4738.66] So, yeah, I think a half height 780 would have the same difficulties involved in building it
[4738.66 → 4740.24] as something like a...
[4740.24 → 4741.22] Whoa, who's who right now?
[4741.42 → 4741.86] I don't know.
[4741.98 → 4743.10] I think I'm the darker one.
[4744.28 → 4745.80] I don't really know.
[4745.80 → 4751.72] As something like a 690, where they essentially had to put two cards on one full-size PCB.
[4752.06 → 4758.26] I don't think the technical difficulties are any different from putting one card on a half-size PCB.
[4758.58 → 4762.64] So you look at how much a GTX 690 costs compared to something like a 770.
[4762.88 → 4767.92] Would you be willing to pay $500 for a 770 that was half the size?
[4767.92 → 4773.50] I think most people would say no to that, and that would be, like, sort of...
[4773.50 → 4777.58] Products can only be developed that there's a market for, and someone will actually buy, so...
[4777.58 → 4780.70] So I figured out one of the buttons I've been pressing doesn't do anything.
[4781.96 → 4782.32] What?
[4783.16 → 4783.46] Yeah.
[4784.12 → 4784.92] Like it's not bound?
[4785.38 → 4785.66] Yeah.
[4785.66 → 4790.56] Or, like, that bound thing doesn't really have a function.
[4791.20 → 4791.74] Okay, hold on.
[4791.80 → 4794.08] Let's go double-check your key bindings here.
[4794.96 → 4795.74] That's awesome.
[4795.86 → 4796.20] Because...
[4796.20 → 4798.02] Because you notice how I finally punched?
[4798.22 → 4804.96] Okay, so this should be A, B, X, Y...
[4804.96 → 4806.24] Oh, wait, no, I'm player one.
[4806.34 → 4808.10] Shoot, I just rebounded all my stuff to yours.
[4808.40 → 4808.72] Low.
[4809.50 → 4811.04] I was like, oh, they're all wrong.
[4811.14 → 4812.60] Oh, wait, that can't be right.
[4812.76 → 4813.60] They might not be wrong.
[4813.60 → 4815.18] I just might have been pressing a button that's...
[4815.18 → 4821.20] Okay, A, B, X, Y.
[4821.64 → 4825.42] No, I think the problem is that in this game, some of the buttons have the same function.
[4825.92 → 4827.82] No, one of the ones I was pressing, he did nothing.
[4827.82 → 4828.56] Just wasn't doing anything?
[4828.76 → 4828.98] Yeah.
[4829.08 → 4829.34] Awesome.
[4829.48 → 4830.16] He did absolutely nothing.
[4830.36 → 4834.48] What do you think about the Leonid NGOs 8500, or 8200, rather?
[4834.52 → 4834.74] I've been using it for a while.
[4834.74 → 4835.46] You use it day to day.
[4835.48 → 4836.52] Yeah, I like it a lot.
[4836.78 → 4838.02] How do you like the shape?
[4838.08 → 4839.76] How does it track on Balrog?
[4840.02 → 4841.10] I've never gamed with it.
[4841.24 → 4842.60] It's not on either of the test benches.
[4842.60 → 4843.30] It's on my laptop.
[4843.30 → 4849.00] Still, I'm not convinced there's that much of a difference in terms of how a mouse performs
[4849.00 → 4851.66] in a game versus how a mouse performs at a desktop.
[4852.82 → 4854.16] Okay, you might notice more.
[4854.56 → 4859.64] But for me, when there's something that annoys me about a mouse, usually it's immediately noticeable
[4859.64 → 4860.52] to me at the desktop.
[4860.82 → 4860.96] Yeah.
[4861.44 → 4862.38] Whoa, that's a thing.
[4864.46 → 4865.94] I'm just going for the jump punch.
[4866.18 → 4867.44] Oh, wow, that is so cheap.
[4867.58 → 4868.92] That does so much damage.
[4868.92 → 4871.60] And, like, knocks you out.
[4873.18 → 4875.66] So you were just picking all the wrong characters all along.
[4877.02 → 4878.02] She's crazy.
[4879.02 → 4881.28] Someone says, why the hate towards me and EA?
[4881.60 → 4882.34] We don't hate you.
[4882.46 → 4882.86] Just EA.
[4883.50 → 4884.30] What's his name?
[4884.74 → 4885.02] White.
[4886.34 → 4886.70] What?
[4886.70 → 4886.78] What?
[4886.78 → 4888.08] Loneliest of all.
[4889.36 → 4890.14] I don't know, man.
[4890.26 → 4892.44] What keyboard would you have for $200?
[4893.16 → 4894.98] Assuming you have no other keyboard.
[4896.30 → 4896.80] Shine 3.
[4897.54 → 4898.14] Shine 3?
[4898.48 → 4898.72] Really?
[4898.96 → 4899.80] Are you going to buy one?
[4899.86 → 4900.48] You're the snake.
[4900.56 → 4900.94] You're the snake.
[4901.00 → 4901.14] Sorry.
[4901.30 → 4902.04] Because aluminum back.
[4902.18 → 4903.10] It'll last for, like, ever.
[4904.60 → 4904.82] Hmm.
[4905.20 → 4905.52] Okay.
[4905.60 → 4906.16] That's a good point.
[4906.24 → 4907.06] Chung's insane.
[4907.06 → 4910.60] Maybe she's insane for people that don't know how to play the game.
[4911.02 → 4911.34] Maybe.
[4912.20 → 4913.00] But she's insane.
[4915.48 → 4916.56] I wonder what keyboard.
[4917.00 → 4921.40] Because I like the Weibull 60, but it's not a perfect keyboard by any stretch of the imagination.
[4922.98 → 4924.18] I'm going to go with Ken again.
[4925.44 → 4928.12] I don't want to leave Chung, but I want to try everything, so I'm going to...
[4928.12 → 4928.58] Go with Lanka.
[4929.18 → 4930.52] He's green, so he must be awesome.
[4931.58 → 4932.44] You played him, didn't you?
[4932.52 → 4932.68] Yeah.
[4932.98 → 4933.24] Okay.
[4933.24 → 4936.24] Um, yeah.
[4936.94 → 4940.66] G710+, I guess, would be the one that I could really recommend.
[4940.80 → 4942.54] I mean, it's Logitech, so it couldn't be that bad.
[4944.30 → 4944.74] And...
[4944.74 → 4946.24] Although, um...
[4947.28 → 4952.24] O-rings don't go that well on tactile feedback, um...
[4953.64 → 4955.68] Cherry switches, because cherry switches...
[4955.68 → 4957.00] Four millimetre travel time.
[4957.20 → 4960.22] You put an O-ring on it, it is now less than four millimetre travel time.
[4960.30 → 4963.22] You have a tactile feedback halfway through that is now not half...
[4963.24 → 4963.74] Halfway through.
[4963.90 → 4966.22] You could argue that that's going to improve responsiveness.
[4967.20 → 4971.22] Um, yes, but not natural responsiveness, because it's not the same distance.
[4972.56 → 4973.30] Ah, crap.
[4973.40 → 4973.94] You dodged it.
[4974.00 → 4974.82] You learned to dodge.
[4974.90 → 4975.48] That's terrible.
[4976.68 → 4978.26] Yeah, because it's not the same distance.
[4978.40 → 4981.44] So, judging where middle is, is very awkward now.
[4981.78 → 4988.40] If you don't have a tactile bump, it's not that awkward, because you go, okay, I'm travelling about this far...
[4988.40 → 4990.46] Like, subconsciously, okay, I'm travelling about this far.
[4990.50 → 4990.68] Right.
[4991.50 → 4991.90] Wow.
[4992.66 → 4993.22] Um...
[4993.22 → 4994.36] I only did it because you did it.
[4994.38 → 4995.00] You started it.
[4995.54 → 4996.60] First, no, I didn't.
[4996.78 → 4999.02] Second of all, I stopped doing it, if you didn't notice.
[4999.02 → 5003.24] I didn't notice, because I was too busy getting back at you for being such a jerk.
[5004.84 → 5011.02] Um, yeah, so your perception of where halfway is without tactile feedback, if there's...
[5011.68 → 5015.58] If it's not four millimetres, is more accurate without an O-ring.
[5016.04 → 5016.38] Hmm.
[5016.38 → 5020.40] Because you can just judge where halfway is, and then you get a bump which isn't halfway.
[5021.48 → 5022.12] And it's...
[5022.12 → 5023.78] I tend to bottom out keys anyway, though.
[5025.20 → 5026.88] Yeah, so it wouldn't really matter.
[5026.90 → 5027.88] So it wouldn't matter for me.
[5027.92 → 5028.02] No.
[5028.02 → 5030.80] If anything, it would probably improve my responsiveness.
[5031.52 → 5033.36] Or the responsiveness of the keyboard for me.
[5033.36 → 5033.54] Maybe.
[5033.76 → 5035.78] It's just a lot of people complain that it feels awkward.
[5035.78 → 5037.64] I'm going with the fat ass for this one.
[5038.54 → 5038.98] Whoa.
[5039.60 → 5042.12] Uh, someone asks if I've ever seen Singularity Computers.
[5042.24 → 5042.48] Yes.
[5042.70 → 5044.54] Uh, amazing builds on YouTube.
[5044.76 → 5045.16] Outstanding.
[5045.16 → 5047.50] I think they were at PAX last year.
[5047.60 → 5050.02] Max asks for opinion on the Nexus 7.
[5051.00 → 5054.16] Uh, my opinion is that it is...
[5054.16 → 5054.72] Sweet.
[5056.16 → 5057.10] Good luck with this.
[5057.24 → 5057.92] I can't back up?
[5059.94 → 5061.12] Why can't I back up?
[5061.12 → 5061.60] He just...
[5061.60 → 5063.56] Wow.
[5066.92 → 5067.74] Aw, man.
[5068.50 → 5068.90] Wow.
[5068.90 → 5075.34] I'm just going to sit on you.
[5076.62 → 5078.04] Which you might enjoy too much.
[5079.90 → 5080.30] No.
[5080.78 → 5082.26] You can't see health bars again.
[5083.32 → 5083.72] Wow.
[5084.18 → 5085.04] You do that a lot.
[5085.14 → 5085.70] Oh, that's awesome.
[5085.90 → 5089.20] So I was actually hands-on with the new Nexus 7 for the first time today.
[5089.34 → 5090.14] I don't know if you know this.
[5090.14 → 5092.20] Um, display looks amazing.
[5092.20 → 5092.88] Um, display looks amazing.
[5093.40 → 5096.68] It is noticeably thinner and lighter than the old Nexus 7.
[5096.78 → 5102.18] So we had a couple of them side by side for an NCI Tech Tips' episode that actually features
[5102.18 → 5103.88] one of their new guys.
[5103.88 → 5109.98] So, uh, Jack is going to be doing a new series of videos called Unpack with Jack.
[5110.64 → 5114.30] And it's not to be confused with Unbox with Linus.
[5114.58 → 5116.38] Which is of course not the same thing at all.
[5116.98 → 5121.00] And, um, so he did like a side-by-side comparison of both of the tablets.
[5121.22 → 5123.36] And it was very noticeable.
[5124.20 → 5127.98] I'm not sold on upgrading from a first-gen Nexus 7.
[5127.98 → 5136.96] And honestly, I guess I give very few cares about that form factor.
[5137.12 → 5138.20] Neither of us care.
[5138.72 → 5141.04] Like, I used my iPad for a bit.
[5142.84 → 5144.76] Um, and now I don't even know where it is.
[5145.02 → 5149.80] And other than the fact that I want to do an unboxing for an iPad accessory, and I can't
[5149.80 → 5152.72] find it, it hasn't bothered me not knowing where my iPad is.
[5154.46 → 5156.16] So, here, tell you what, tell you what.
[5156.22 → 5157.12] Here, back off, back off.
[5157.12 → 5161.68] Uh, it's down, down, diagonal, forward, and then punch.
[5162.04 → 5163.92] There's a down, diagonal thing?
[5164.48 → 5164.90] Yeah.
[5166.64 → 5168.04] That's the, well, don't kick.
[5168.44 → 5169.14] That's a kick.
[5169.54 → 5170.88] Down, diagonal, forward, punch.
[5172.02 → 5173.00] Like, in that order.
[5173.64 → 5175.12] To throw the fireball thing.
[5176.82 → 5177.90] Down, diagonal, punch.
[5179.00 → 5179.26] Here.
[5179.48 → 5180.30] What down, diagonal?
[5182.74 → 5183.18] Oh.
[5183.18 → 5183.46] Oh.
[5183.46 → 5184.46] Okay.
[5186.92 → 5187.24] Okay.
[5187.70 → 5188.38] Well, there it goes.
[5188.64 → 5189.18] So, this one.
[5190.24 → 5191.22] All right, maybe it's kick then.
[5191.54 → 5192.04] So, anyway.
[5192.26 → 5192.84] There, go ahead.
[5192.94 → 5193.98] I'm giving you the combo.
[5194.48 → 5197.16] So, if you can execute it at all, you should be able to beat me.
[5197.22 → 5198.54] Because I don't know anything with this guy.
[5199.54 → 5199.86] Okay.
[5200.06 → 5201.12] Well, that was interesting.
[5202.12 → 5203.34] That's not what I showed you.
[5204.50 → 5208.68] Now, the apprentice has, uh, overtaken the master.
[5209.44 → 5211.30] Not that I'm a master at fighting games.
[5211.30 → 5211.52] Scam!
[5212.38 → 5212.96] Whoa, what?
[5213.04 → 5213.78] I thought you died.
[5214.36 → 5215.60] The helpers are so confusing.
[5215.60 → 5219.20] I know, and sometimes they fall in slow motion, even when, like, bad things don't happen.
[5219.28 → 5219.48] Yeah.
[5220.18 → 5221.62] So, Nexus 7 is awesome.
[5221.76 → 5224.08] It's a new Nexus, and it is therefore good.
[5224.08 → 5227.28] But, I'm just not sold on the 7-inch tablet form factor.
[5227.42 → 5228.32] I like smartphone.
[5228.70 → 5232.44] I actually eventually got used to the whole 5-inch class smartphone.
[5232.44 → 5236.52] But, if I was going to use a tablet, I think I want something bigger.
[5237.30 → 5241.98] Like, I don't always believe that further miniaturization of the devices is actually better.
[5243.36 → 5247.70] Like, I, I, I don't think I'd go smaller than 13-inch on a notebook, for example.
[5248.40 → 5251.06] I like the I like the 13-inch size keyboard.
[5251.60 → 5254.24] Um, I like having a high-resolution display.
[5254.36 → 5257.22] So, at least 1080p at 13-inch is actually pretty good.
[5258.62 → 5259.34] So, there you go.
[5259.44 → 5261.04] Someone hits Linus on Twitter, apparently.
[5261.04 → 5266.88] Because I said to hit me on Twitter, so they put, like, in asterisks, hits Linus on Twitter.
[5267.48 → 5269.08] So, that was, I'm going to be a DJ.
[5269.96 → 5270.60] That's cool.
[5270.64 → 5273.20] Who's, it's not a stereotype that he's black at all, but.
[5273.70 → 5274.10] Oh, no.
[5274.44 → 5275.32] Why would you even?
[5276.42 → 5276.88] I don't know.
[5278.26 → 5281.86] Um, I ordered the custom one pro.
[5282.36 → 5285.10] Oh, which non-reference GTX 780?
[5285.34 → 5287.72] We actually only have one, the Asus one.
[5287.72 → 5291.22] And we unanimously agree that it's better than reference.
[5291.70 → 5291.82] Yeah.
[5292.18 → 5293.66] I like the look of reference.
[5293.72 → 5295.24] Oh, I like the look of the reference one, too.
[5295.34 → 5296.32] So dead sexy.
[5296.70 → 5297.26] Look at this.
[5297.32 → 5298.02] His name's DJ.
[5298.44 → 5299.90] He's black, and he's, like, a breakdancer.
[5300.68 → 5304.60] It's, like, the kind of stuff that you could get away with in the 90s, right?
[5304.60 → 5310.42] It's, like, these days, like, the political correctness police would be all over you for
[5310.42 → 5311.04] this kind of thing.
[5313.34 → 5315.64] He probably jumps higher than the other characters, too.
[5316.08 → 5316.58] Look at him.
[5316.78 → 5317.76] He's basically dancing.
[5318.96 → 5319.74] That's cool.
[5320.88 → 5323.18] It's, like, practically wearing parachute pants.
[5323.18 → 5330.54] Um, so we actually, I actually requested from Gigabyte today, uh, their Wind force GTX 780.
[5330.92 → 5332.68] So then we'll be able to compare it.
[5332.72 → 5336.18] But right now, it looks like the direct CU2 is a very, very, very good bet.
[5336.90 → 5341.36] So let's go to, uh, oh, oh, oh, that's, that's how it's going to be.
[5341.58 → 5342.40] I backed up right after I did it.
[5342.40 → 5347.36] So first you use a character that has claws instead of hands, which is obviously cheating.
[5347.78 → 5348.76] Are both of his hands claws?
[5348.94 → 5349.58] Yeah, I think so.
[5350.04 → 5351.44] I don't even know if Sega's a guy.
[5351.44 → 5357.32] Both of the it's, is it more offensive to call it the wrong thing, or it?
[5357.96 → 5361.50] I think it is considered pretty offensive by everyone.
[5363.44 → 5365.20] It's got a little bit behind it, I think?
[5365.42 → 5366.84] No, no, just in general, though.
[5367.08 → 5368.40] Whoa, what am I doing?
[5368.78 → 5371.08] I don't know, but you're, like, dodging kicks by, like...
[5371.08 → 5371.48] Whoa!
[5373.18 → 5373.82] Hey-oh!
[5374.70 → 5376.38] I dodged so much stuff during that.
[5376.66 → 5377.78] I should've just kept doing it.
[5377.78 → 5381.90] Whoa, my guy does a cool backflip, too.
[5382.54 → 5383.48] There you go, you're dead.
[5384.56 → 5387.42] All right, you guys, oh, we should talk about the Windows 8 topic!
[5388.06 → 5388.60] Ha ha!
[5389.80 → 5395.72] Your whole Windows, what would make Windows 9 the sort of one-size-fits-all?
[5395.72 → 5398.08] So, my idea is...
[5398.08 → 5400.66] Which I don't necessarily agree with, but I don't disagree with either.
[5401.44 → 5404.60] It's very rough, and you could change things, but the...
[5404.60 → 5405.24] I like it rough.
[5405.82 → 5410.68] The core idea is that when you turn on the computer, at least when you first start using
[5410.68 → 5415.88] the computer, the initial splash screen is the Windows logo with the four different panels,
[5415.88 → 5420.42] and then you'd have, like, classic mode or whatever the heck you want to call it, which
[5420.42 → 5425.24] is basically just, like, the Windows 7 idea, and then you could have business mode, which
[5425.24 → 5426.68] is the Windows 7 idea...
[5426.68 → 5430.16] I didn't get to change my character again, I don't know why that sometimes happens...
[5430.16 → 5432.74] But encrypted.
[5433.60 → 5439.02] And then you could have entertainment mode, which loads, like, XMBC or Windows Media Centre
[5439.02 → 5443.50] or whatever, and then you could have touch mode, which is modern UI.
[5443.54 → 5444.02] Modern UI.
[5444.02 → 5447.02] So, you can do everything...
[5447.80 → 5450.36] Wow, I really don't like that guy.
[5451.12 → 5452.56] I'm just going to let you kill me.
[5453.28 → 5456.04] Because the same outcome would happen both ways.
[5457.72 → 5462.84] Yeah, and then you could choose a default to load into, and that would have to be obvious
[5462.84 → 5464.36] and really easy to do.
[5466.60 → 5467.58] And that's about it.
[5468.72 → 5469.86] And then I...
[5469.86 → 5471.86] I mean, I...
[5471.86 → 5473.82] I don't think they'd ever do it.
[5474.02 → 5475.74] But I don't think it's a terrible idea.
[5475.96 → 5480.46] I think it's something that a third-party dev is more likely to do.
[5480.70 → 5481.46] That'd be awesome.
[5482.20 → 5483.00] That'd be really cool.
[5483.34 → 5484.56] But it would have to be, like...
[5484.56 → 5485.82] Really well integrated.
[5486.04 → 5488.28] Yeah, it would have to be, like, a pretty good...
[5488.28 → 5488.46] Whoa.
[5489.18 → 5489.78] Was that me?
[5489.92 → 5490.50] Yeah, it was you.
[5491.80 → 5492.66] That was cool.
[5492.66 → 5497.20] It's funny when there are certain characters that you're like, yeah, there's actually just
[5497.20 → 5498.68] a lot about this guy that I don't understand.
[5499.64 → 5501.30] And this guy's probably one of them.
[5501.80 → 5502.84] I'm going to punch you in the balls.
[5504.28 → 5504.58] No.
[5504.98 → 5505.34] Boom.
[5505.48 → 5505.84] Did that work?
[5506.00 → 5507.86] Not that we're sure if Vega has balls or not.
[5508.06 → 5508.52] No idea.
[5509.66 → 5512.10] So, yeah, I mean, I...
[5512.10 → 5513.66] You're right.
[5513.72 → 5515.14] A third-party dev would probably have to do it.
[5515.32 → 5518.62] And that might have problems with certain implementation and stuff like that.
[5519.12 → 5520.68] It'd be incompatible with this.
[5520.68 → 5521.44] Yeah, yeah.
[5521.44 → 5522.14] It wouldn't work with that.
[5522.32 → 5525.64] But what would be neat about a third-party doing it would be...
[5525.64 → 5528.18] Okay, how about we go Calcium versus Chung?
[5528.40 → 5531.34] Because those are the ones that we can both agree are just, like, stupid OP.
[5531.62 → 5531.88] Sure.
[5532.06 → 5532.68] Oh, wait.
[5533.18 → 5534.18] But I have to be...
[5534.18 → 5535.28] You can be Chung if you want.
[5535.58 → 5535.82] Okay.
[5536.20 → 5536.62] Okay, ready?
[5536.84 → 5537.18] Let's go.
[5537.18 → 5542.14] I think Calcium's going to win, but I don't know Calcium at all, so I'd rather play the one that I can.
[5542.14 → 5542.90] I don't know him at all.
[5543.06 → 5545.08] I just know how to do the punch.
[5545.16 → 5546.32] Is it just a standard punch?
[5546.36 → 5546.54] Yeah.
[5546.74 → 5547.96] I thought you were doing a thing.
[5548.04 → 5548.64] That's ridiculous.
[5549.18 → 5549.86] No, I know, right?
[5554.10 → 5554.78] Oh, crap.
[5555.20 → 5555.80] I'm in trouble.
[5560.06 → 5560.90] Gotta get above it.
[5561.00 → 5561.26] No!
[5561.26 → 5562.06] Gotta get above it.
[5562.10 → 5562.74] Kick her in the head.
[5563.66 → 5564.06] No!
[5564.42 → 5566.16] Kick her in the head from four miles away.
[5566.34 → 5567.60] Oh, my God.
[5567.72 → 5567.94] Yes!
[5568.80 → 5570.72] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5571.10 → 5571.86] No, no, no, no.
[5572.02 → 5573.08] Oh, terrible.
[5573.50 → 5573.92] Chung.
[5574.72 → 5576.24] Opinions on Ivy Bridge E.
[5576.56 → 5580.32] It will be Ivy Bridge, but with more cores, and fits on LGA 2011.
[5581.50 → 5589.82] There's not really much to have an opinion about, because it's basically just Ivy Bridge, but, like, more E.
[5589.88 → 5590.18] No, wrong way.
[5590.38 → 5590.56] Yeah.
[5590.56 → 5593.62] Like, E for entertainment.
[5594.36 → 5595.20] E for excitement.
[5595.96 → 5596.98] E for extreme.
[5597.66 → 5598.66] Maybe Chung wins.
[5598.90 → 5600.18] What do you think about the Moto X?
[5600.94 → 5605.70] Um, I wish it was sort of a higher-end product.
[5606.70 → 5607.94] Google doesn't really do that.
[5607.94 → 5608.94] Yeah.
[5608.94 → 5610.20] Yeah.
[5610.20 → 5615.20] I mean, Nexus 7 was intended to be very sort of mainstream-y.
[5615.20 → 5618.40] They're always, like, pretty nice, but they're never bleeding edge.
[5618.40 → 5621.16] Yeah, like, Terra 3 was an okay solution at the time.
[5621.20 → 5621.96] It was pretty fast.
[5622.20 → 5622.38] Yeah.
[5622.38 → 5623.38] And then you look at Nexus 10.
[5623.38 → 5623.84] Like, it's never bad.
[5623.84 → 5624.02] It's never bad.
[5624.38 → 5630.26] They weren't the first to have a high-resolution display by any stretch, but, you know, they had a pretty nice display.
[5630.38 → 5637.40] It's not like Apple, where they try to put the best display that anyone could ever build on every device.
[5637.40 → 5642.34] I did hear about one of the topics we didn't get to is Samsung's going to be making the new panels for iPad Mini.
[5642.70 → 5642.92] Yeah.
[5643.00 → 5644.32] It's going to be, like, sharper than Retina.
[5644.74 → 5645.02] Yeah.
[5645.18 → 5646.92] That's very much a rumour right now, though.
[5647.16 → 5647.44] Oh, really?
[5647.44 → 5656.28] Because there's also some code found somewhere that indicates that the new iPad Mini will be faster, not higher resolution.
[5656.54 → 5656.74] Oh.
[5657.04 → 5658.30] And it'll just be, like, a speed bump.
[5658.30 → 5660.94] So he kicks, like, backwards when I jump in the air.
[5661.00 → 5661.34] Look at this.
[5661.94 → 5663.78] This is the stupidest animation ever.
[5664.16 → 5665.16] Like, my guy's, uh...
[5665.16 → 5666.48] Your knee just breaks.
[5666.66 → 5667.22] I know, right?
[5668.40 → 5670.40] And his leg just gets longer.
[5671.16 → 5671.64] What?
[5675.22 → 5675.70] Awesome.
[5675.70 → 5676.14] Whoa.
[5676.82 → 5677.46] That was cool.
[5677.48 → 5678.14] I don't know what I did.
[5678.38 → 5679.96] Oh, it's something to do with down.
[5681.26 → 5682.54] Aw, you kicked me.
[5682.62 → 5683.14] A thunder tool?
[5683.14 → 5684.06] Can I get past it?
[5685.00 → 5685.56] Lightning tool?
[5685.56 → 5686.90] What keyboard would you...
[5686.90 → 5687.30] Oh, okay.
[5687.50 → 5688.40] What's better for you?
[5688.52 → 5690.04] Lightning connector or micro USB?
[5690.36 → 5690.98] Oh, lightning.
[5691.36 → 5691.84] 100%.
[5691.84 → 5693.30] I like how you can put it in either way.
[5693.36 → 5693.54] Yeah.
[5693.66 → 5694.48] That's pretty awesome.
[5694.56 → 5694.72] Yeah.
[5694.98 → 5696.66] No, lightning is, like...
[5696.66 → 5697.66] Wow.
[5698.66 → 5701.94] Just vastly superior to micro USB in every possible way.
[5702.90 → 5703.12] Yeah.
[5703.82 → 5705.92] You saw it coming, but there was nothing you could do.
[5706.16 → 5706.96] That's crazy.
[5707.06 → 5707.76] That's pretty cool.
[5708.72 → 5712.20] See, but every time I see something ridiculous like that, I'm like, okay, well, my dude probably
[5712.20 → 5713.44] has something I just sucked.
[5715.12 → 5716.62] Because, like, you see all...
[5716.62 → 5717.52] Oh, no!
[5717.86 → 5718.18] Yeah!
[5719.98 → 5723.20] You see all these characters used in competitive scene, so...
[5723.20 → 5725.62] I have to be good at something.
[5726.16 → 5727.36] No way.
[5728.94 → 5730.20] That's so poppy.
[5730.54 → 5731.28] Yeah, I know, right?
[5731.28 → 5734.10] That's pretty tall.
[5734.66 → 5738.68] Will I be able to use the stock cooler for the i5-4670K for overclocking?
[5739.08 → 5739.38] No.
[5740.18 → 5741.06] Technically, yes.
[5741.40 → 5742.60] Like, 100 megahertz.
[5743.02 → 5743.22] Yeah.
[5745.64 → 5752.38] Haswell really has some serious business going on with heat output, particularly when overclocking.
[5752.38 → 5757.52] You are not going to want to use that completely ineffectual stock cooler.
[5757.86 → 5758.04] Yeah.
[5758.18 → 5760.16] For overclocking in any way, shape, or form.
[5761.28 → 5761.72] Nope.
[5762.28 → 5764.12] Book, book, book, book, book.
[5764.18 → 5765.50] Got my knees, got my leg break.
[5766.38 → 5766.78] No!
[5767.02 → 5767.38] Yes!
[5768.18 → 5769.72] I hate dying to that.
[5770.48 → 5773.16] I'm like, oh, I'm coming back, and then electric shock.
[5774.96 → 5775.40] Dang.
[5776.08 → 5776.78] That's unfortunate.
[5779.18 → 5780.18] I know that guy.
[5780.26 → 5780.88] I went to school with him.
[5781.18 → 5781.38] Who?
[5781.46 → 5781.90] John Wisker?
[5781.90 → 5782.30] Yep.
[5782.88 → 5783.12] Hello!
[5783.64 → 5787.04] $0 for Nexus 4 or $150 for HTC One?
[5790.00 → 5790.44] Ooh.
[5791.68 → 5792.92] Personally, HTC One.
[5793.62 → 5793.92] Yeah?
[5794.26 → 5795.78] Would you pay $150 for a phone?
[5795.84 → 5797.74] Have you ever paid $150 for a phone?
[5797.88 → 5798.16] No.
[5798.58 → 5800.60] So I guess it really depends on which one I get for free.
[5803.10 → 5803.54] Aww.
[5804.36 → 5806.02] If you have the money, HTC One.
[5806.38 → 5808.22] I just went left until it picked something.
[5808.28 → 5809.06] I hated this guy.
[5809.48 → 5809.84] Right?
[5810.22 → 5811.42] Like, so much.
[5811.42 → 5815.02] I'm not going to use the electric move this time.
[5815.80 → 5816.36] Oh, whatever.
[5817.90 → 5818.86] Like, look at this, look, look.
[5818.86 → 5819.76] Okay, I did it by accident that time.
[5819.76 → 5819.96] Look, look.
[5820.54 → 5820.96] Ugh.
[5821.48 → 5821.84] Ugh.
[5822.22 → 5822.46] Ugh.
[5822.74 → 5823.62] Like, what?
[5823.62 → 5825.80] What does that even do?
[5825.80 → 5830.04] So, they make the black guy super athletic, and then they make the native guy just, like,
[5830.14 → 5830.70] ineffectual.
[5830.70 → 5832.84] Deep when you jump in the air.
[5834.84 → 5835.20] What?
[5836.20 → 5837.24] That was when I do that.
[5837.36 → 5837.46] Nope.
[5837.46 → 5840.12] I love how stereotypes were just okay.
[5840.12 → 5840.86] Almost as a thing.
[5840.86 → 5841.64] Even 10 years ago.
[5841.64 → 5843.46] It's like, yeah, we have a native guy.
[5843.82 → 5849.00] Therefore, he wears, like, tan leather hides, has feathers in his hair.
[5849.16 → 5855.84] In spite of the fact that there actually weren't that many subsets of Native Americans that put feathers in their hair.
[5855.84 → 5858.62] Like, it was not necessarily a big thing.
[5858.64 → 5861.86] Wasn't it more different hairdos instead of putting feathers in?
[5862.26 → 5868.86] It was just, like, this is, like, the whitest possible interpretation of what was going on.
[5868.86 → 5873.94] Because we saw the first one we saw just had, like, feathers in his hair, and we're like, oh, so you guys do that, huh?
[5873.94 → 5879.70] Or even, like, not the first one, just, like, the first one that was, like, hot or something.
[5880.16 → 5882.52] So it was, like, that was what we noticed.
[5883.88 → 5884.06] Oh.
[5884.54 → 5885.36] Technical knockout.
[5886.24 → 5886.60] Yes.
[5888.20 → 5888.56] Oh.
[5890.10 → 5891.44] I didn't know that was a thing.
[5893.68 → 5895.28] Moto X offers awesome customization.
[5895.64 → 5898.64] You can choose a different build material and colour.
[5898.74 → 5900.80] So you can actually get it with wood on the back.
[5901.22 → 5901.50] Whoa.
[5901.50 → 5902.24] Yeah, yeah.
[5902.38 → 5903.34] My picture was with that.
[5903.34 → 5907.18] Yeah, they're validating four different kinds of wood, which I think is pretty cool.
[5908.24 → 5909.34] Apparently there are a lot of complied...
[5909.98 → 5917.00] Apparently there are a lot of complications to do with using wood in a phone.
[5917.20 → 5920.02] So, like, you have to seal it properly and all that kind of stuff.
[5920.38 → 5920.58] Yep.
[5921.32 → 5922.28] You've got to use it in the rain.
[5922.96 → 5923.28] Yeah.
[5923.70 → 5927.50] And you're going to be holding it all the time, so your oils in your skin kind of wear it out a little bit.
[5929.96 → 5930.32] Hmm.
[5930.32 → 5936.32] Instead of manually selecting, you can have the OS recognize whether you have touch or not and decide to install...
[5936.32 → 5941.48] Decide which UI it thinks is best for you, and then you could hopefully override it in some way.
[5942.60 → 5943.56] Remove touch.
[5943.70 → 5947.96] And then it could maybe detect your panel to see if it's a TV.
[5948.98 → 5949.32] Yeah.
[5949.58 → 5950.32] That'd be kind of cool.
[5951.08 → 5953.32] And then you could override the auto-select, obviously.
[5953.32 → 5953.50] Yeah.
[5953.50 → 5959.36] Okay, well, I think I've had enough Street Fighter, and I'm basically tired and want to go home anyway.
[5960.04 → 5964.08] So, thank you guys for tuning in to the Land Show and the After Party.
[5964.50 → 5968.78] Don't forget to tune in again next week for our very special guest.
[5968.88 → 5975.76] Actually, I think we're going to reschedule the guests, so I'm going to have to double-check who exactly is joining us next week.
[5976.30 → 5978.16] But, yeah, we will have a special guest.
[5978.22 → 5978.84] It'll be awesome.
[5979.08 → 5979.80] And good night, everyone.
[5980.30 → 5980.78] All right, guys.
[5981.68 → 5982.44] I might have a nap.
[5982.44 → 5985.50] It's like 9 o'clock.
[5985.64 → 5986.60] You might as well just go to sleep.
[5986.82 → 5987.68] Yeah, I might just go to bed.
[5987.96 → 5990.24] Okay, can you upload the archive first?
[5990.78 → 5991.92] I have to comment the whole thing.
[5991.98 → 5992.92] That takes like an hour.
[5994.34 → 5995.40] I can do it in less.
[5996.20 → 5996.54] Okay.
[5997.10 → 5998.96] That's probably because I'm doing other things at the same time.
[5999.04 → 5999.28] Right.
[5999.68 → 6001.28] But still, it kind of takes...
