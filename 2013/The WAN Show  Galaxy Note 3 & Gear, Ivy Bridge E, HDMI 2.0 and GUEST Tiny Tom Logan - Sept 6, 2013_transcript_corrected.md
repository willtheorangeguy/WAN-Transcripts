[0.00 → 5.20] Well that took a little bit longer than I was expecting. I had it set to
[5.20 → 10.56] automatically detect the best server, and normally I just have it selected
[10.56 → 16.44] manually so yeah. So that took a couple of minutes there, but the good news is we're
[16.44 → 21.42] live it's the WAN show and our topics for today are extremely exciting. Number
[21.42 → 26.40] one is Slick is sick, and I'm making them work anyway.
[26.40 → 31.38] Yep. Isn't that fantastic? Go report it to someone who thinks that that's a
[31.38 → 35.04] problem. I guess your mom would probably be the only one who would care. Yep. But
[35.04 → 39.54] she'll care a lot, and she'll let me know all about that. Yep. Intel has launched
[39.54 → 44.28] Ivy Bridge E. So for those of you who don't know what the E stands for it stands
[44.28 → 55.14] for extreme or enthusiast or epidural or eggs. We don't know what it stands for
[55.14 → 60.12] but basically it means that it's on the higher end LGA 2011 platform versus LGA
[60.12 → 65.22] 1155 which is what Ivy Bridge was initially on. Also, we have new details
[65.22 → 69.72] about Intel's upcoming Bradwell architecture. So those two topics in
[69.72 → 72.66] particular we're going to be discussing with our special guest this week Tiny Tom
[72.66 → 78.00] Logan from Overclock3D.net or Time to Live Customs on YouTube, and we're also
[78.00 → 83.00] going to be talking about Microsoft's big move, big power play move, billions of
[83.00 → 88.88] billions of dollars to purchase Nokia's devices and services business as well as
[88.88 → 92.36] license a bunch of patents and other cool stuff like that and finally
[92.36 → 99.74] Samsung's Galaxy Gear. I'm holding up my wrist as if I had one, but I don't. So maybe
[99.74 → 102.38] at some point I'll have one but then again maybe not because I don't use a
[102.38 → 106.40] Samsung smartphone and at launch the Galaxy Gear will only work with the new
[106.40 → 111.98] Tab 10.1 and the Note 3 which might seem bewildering, but there may actually be a
[111.98 → 116.98] reason for this. So without further ado intro time!
[116.98 → 145.74] So just a reminder guys we are sponsored by Squarespace. So
[145.74 → 153.06] squarespace.com slash Linus you can get 20% off on new accounts if you use offer
[153.06 → 157.86] code Linus9. So I know that that text there is wrong they actually updated the
[157.86 → 162.78] deal for this month like two days ago so there you go guys 20% off use offer code
[162.78 → 166.42] Linus9 and you might kind of go well I've never actually heard of Squarespace
[166.42 → 170.02] before why would I want 20% off and why would I use offer code Linus9 if I don't
[170.02 → 173.94] even know what it does. So Squarespace is basically an easy way to create your own
[173.94 → 177.84] website they handle the hosting if you sign up for a year they actually even
[177.84 → 181.44] throw in a domain they've got a bunch of different templates over 20 now that
[181.44 → 186.84] allow you to configure your website whether it's a store or a blog or a
[186.84 → 190.94] gallery for your hardware that you want it did I say hardware? I've got like
[190.94 → 195.26] hardware a gallery for your hardware okay please don't please don't make that
[195.26 → 200.46] site on Squarespace or anywhere thank you anyway guys, so Squarespace is our
[200.46 → 205.20] sponsor today and a big thanks to them and as always our live guests are
[205.20 → 208.20] powered by Racer comes I never get that right when I try to point I'm all like
[208.20 → 213.12] yo somewhere so if you use that Bitly link right there you can try out Racer
[213.12 → 218.24] comes it is in beta, and it's not perfect, but we've definitely had some good
[218.24 → 221.58] experiences with it that we can't necessarily say about some of the other
[221.58 → 225.84] clients we've been using in fact we had a big problem with Skype over the last
[225.84 → 228.96] little while you guys have noticed we've been streaming at kind of horrible
[228.96 → 232.68] quality the show has been going down in the middle of us trying to stream the
[232.68 → 238.62] show to you all, and it's been generally a big problem so it turns out that even
[238.62 → 245.08] the Skype beta does not address the issue with the IP resolver allowing someone
[245.08 → 251.00] malicious who knows your Skype ID to get your IP and DDoS the Jesus out of you
[251.00 → 254.40] while you're trying to stream a show so as much as I might have thought it was
[254.40 → 261.24] Shaw my ISP and as much as it was Shaw the first time around yeah the problem no
[261.24 → 264.84] longer we believe lies with Shaw, and it actually had to do with us being attacked
[264.84 → 270.18] so I no longer use Skype I'm off Skype goodbye Skype no more Skype so there you
[270.18 → 276.06] go guys we shouldn't receive any sort of interruptions today however now that
[276.06 → 281.06] I've said if it's like how do you always do that I know I know it's its like I just
[281.06 → 285.08] actually can't resist reminder our special guest again powered by Racer
[285.08 → 290.36] comes is tiny Tom Logan from overclock3d.net on YouTube you can find
[290.36 → 294.58] him at YouTube.com time to live customs so he'll be on in a little bit we're
[294.58 → 298.16] going to be talking about Intel's new stuff, but I guess without further ado why don't
[298.16 → 305.82] we kick off our first big topic which is Tesla's Model S is the safest car ever
[305.82 → 310.22] tested by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration how many of
[310.22 → 314.24] that car could they fit on top of its own roof I think it was something like four
[314.24 → 319.82] cars they could actually take four Model S's and stack them on top of one Model S
[319.82 → 324.14] before the roof would collapse that's pretty insane so you couple that with
[324.14 → 327.26] the fact that like there's a bunch of stuff about the design that is
[327.26 → 331.00] inherently better and then there's stuff where they went and made it better so
[331.00 → 335.06] think about this okay, so there's no engine in the front how do modern cars
[335.06 → 340.58] work older cars designed back in the 70s and 80s were designed to be very
[340.58 → 344.78] rigid yeah the idea was that when you hit something you wanted the car to be
[344.78 → 350.18] strong yeah yeah and like you know you break through whatever you want to win
[350.18 → 356.96] yeah you want to win yeah but bigger battery room in recent decades it's
[356.96 → 359.72] actually changed and the way that they've designed cars is with what are
[359.72 → 364.52] called crumple zones, so the idea is that instead of like dead stop for those left
[364.52 → 369.80] for dead folks out there instead of dead stopping which can cause you to become
[369.80 → 375.26] dead because you hit the dash really hard the idea is that you actually slow down
[375.26 → 379.82] the deceleration process while you're crashing by having the car crumple into
[379.82 → 385.22] itself but in such a way that the passengers area the passenger yeah is not
[385.22 → 390.74] affected so Tesla in their infinite wisdom or luck or whatever you want to call
[390.74 → 398.14] it well their cars don't have engines so in the front of the car instead because
[398.14 → 402.08] we're used to a traditional shape it's like when you designed a car you know 30
[402.08 → 405.14] years ago it was like oh well okay we need somewhere to put the engine
[405.14 → 410.30] I guess you got two options hood or trunks and so most people went the hood
[410.30 → 413.96] route some people went the trunk route, so Tesla doesn't have an engine in the
[413.96 → 417.08] front so what that means is because we've got a shape that we're used to
[417.08 → 420.64] seeing which would accommodate that and there's a lot of space there that's a
[420.64 → 425.42] big old crumple zone which is very, very cool they've also designed things like
[425.42 → 428.90] the rear-facing seats like honestly like I was looking this up last night, and I was
[428.90 → 433.46] like hon should we get should we get a Model S, and she's like how much are they I'm like
[433.46 → 440.78] um like 80 grand to start without the like rear-facing kid seat that I'm
[440.78 → 445.22] about to talk about she's like yeah I think you already know the answer that so
[445.22 → 449.36] anyway there's a there's a can install rear-facing seats so you can seat up to
[449.36 → 453.20] seven people in it, and they have like a double bumper system that allows even
[453.20 → 458.30] rear collisions to protect those occupants so okay let's put this in
[458.30 → 461.90] perspective you should have given her the safety speech they spend
[461.90 → 465.08] anything on protecting the baby that's right think of the children think of
[465.08 → 470.96] the children so they exceeded every safety score for a sedan then exceeded
[470.96 → 475.88] every safety score ever for an SUV then exceeded every safety score ever for
[475.88 → 481.34] minivans so even though it's only a sedan it's as safe as those other
[481.34 → 486.68] vehicles according to the testing which was revised in 2011 to be much more much
[486.68 → 491.54] more difficult to score well in right one of the other inherent things about it so
[491.54 → 496.94] because batteries are heavy, and the batteries are mounted very low down in
[496.94 → 501.08] the car that actually gives it an advantage in terms of handling and also
[501.08 → 505.94] makes it extremely difficult to flip yeah so during testing they actually had to
[505.94 → 509.72] use a quote-unquote this is all from Tesla's press release so they had to use
[509.72 → 514.88] special methods to even flip the car because it's like well kill the weights in
[514.88 → 519.14] the bottom yeah so now what I mean go fill a two-litre full of like you know
[519.14 → 524.24] lead shot and like try to tip it right it's like common sense I guess but
[524.24 → 528.86] obviously if you have something like an engine that you can't just build under
[528.86 → 533.66] the car then what are you supposed to do yeah so anyway if you guys are if you
[533.66 → 536.66] guys are interested in checking out a little bit more detail about basically
[536.66 → 540.98] me getting all excited because I have like kids now, so I'm all like oh I need a car
[540.98 → 545.24] let's say safety rating I know right I'm gonna drive on a motorcycle all day so
[545.24 → 550.76] it's not it's not only overall five stars but actually scored five stars in every
[550.76 → 555.50] single category which has never been done, so I think this graph right here is
[555.50 → 559.76] supposed to kind of mean something but the model s is kind of like this weird
[559.76 → 564.08] outlier data point I don't even know how I could write yeah I can use my mouth here
[564.08 → 570.44] it's like this weird outlier so it's the relative risk score and then this shows
[570.44 → 575.06] kind of everything else, and it's like yeah you're good so one thing that's also
[575.06 → 579.56] covered in the press release is that there hasn't actually been a fatality in a
[579.56 → 584.84] Tesla model s, yet I mean obviously that won't last forever there have been some
[584.84 → 590.00] some pretty good crashes but no one's actually died yet and they also
[590.00 → 595.46] point out that there have been no fires not a single fire not a single
[595.46 → 600.44] fire yet not on a production unit, so there have been fires okay yeah yeah but
[600.44 → 604.88] but not production fires that's good though yeah no it's outstanding I'm like
[604.88 → 609.72] I'm like super thrilled because as much as this is super not relevant to me
[609.72 → 613.70] because I don't have any I like I was putting on just for fun right like I was
[613.70 → 618.24] putting on like the options I bought I'm like well I want the extended battery and
[618.24 → 624.74] like yeah I want the sound system and like I want all this stuff and I was
[624.74 → 627.66] like oh yeah it's like a hundred grand yeah by the time I put in the stuff I
[627.66 → 631.02] wanted it's like okay so what I'll do is I'll wait for someone else to decide
[631.02 → 636.50] what they want to buy one like lose their job, and then I'll buy it from them
[636.50 → 641.46] yeah secondhand cars that's how you do it man never bought a new vehicle to this
[641.46 → 648.14] day you know what guys hit us on Twitter at Linus Tech let me know
[648.14 → 653.98] your thoughts on buying a new car versus buying a used car what do you do and in
[653.98 → 660.02] 140 characters or fewer why do you go that route I'm very, very curious to hear what
[660.02 → 665.00] you guys think me too actually speaking of hearing what you guys think Microsoft
[665.00 → 672.14] buys Nokia's devices and services business, so this is interesting, so this is a
[672.14 → 677.98] post from guns cool on the forum he's all like okay so what did Microsoft buy
[677.98 → 682.76] exactly the original source is the verge because they're awesome and other than
[682.76 → 686.02] that one time I had to kind of burn them on something I was going to say no it's been twice
[686.02 → 690.70] man is it twice yeah okay well whatever they're still they're still actually pretty
[690.70 → 696.54] like the original so pretty much they're they're they're buying the devices and services division
[696.54 → 704.54] including I think it was something like 32,000 employees let's see yeah 32,000 employees will
[704.54 → 710.54] be transferred I think it was something like 16,000 of them or 18,000 of them were in manufacturing and
[710.54 → 716.54] distribution, so this is very much a hardware play they're they're buying they're buying the hardware
[716.54 → 724.04] they're buying the hardware they licensed their patents for 10 years which Microsoft has the right to renew
[724.04 → 733.78] sort of at their discretion yeah this was all for 7.18 billion dollars and the idea so this was one of
[733.78 → 740.60] Palmer's comments on the latest shareholders call or whatever kind of call he was on was it'll allow
[740.60 → 746.96] them to better integrate the branding and among other things I mean I really hope
[746.96 → 751.04] there's more to it than that yeah but like one of the questions was like well you know
[751.04 → 756.68] the branding's been kind of confusing like you know the Nokia Lucia 920 you know
[756.68 → 764.10] Windows Phone 8 like what is that, and it is a good point Windows Phone 8 is kind of a
[764.10 → 773.76] sort of sludgy yeah clunky name compared to Android or iOS catchy, and they always have yeah I'm not
[773.76 → 778.14] going to get into that right now, but I really hope there's a deeper plan than that, so I mean it just
[778.14 → 783.12] seems weird and then there wasn't it Nokia that just did the Kit Kat break thing for Samsung
[783.12 → 790.16] yes so it's interesting that Microsoft is doing an acquisition at being a very passive company and
[790.16 → 794.04] they're acquiring someone who's traditionally quite aggressive it's funny though because they've been
[794.04 → 798.72] they've been less like that lately yeah yeah that's that's been my observation I was actually
[798.72 → 802.88] pretty surprised at the Kit Kat things I haven't seen them be crazy for a while yeah and like you
[802.88 → 808.62] know Microsoft was going on the attack against you against Google for the whole YouTube app thing on
[808.62 → 813.72] Windows Phone where it's just like here we're just gonna start like writing open letters and doing
[813.72 → 820.50] things like that they've been they've been very communicative about Xbox One overall you know whether that
[820.50 → 826.18] was something things people wanted to hear or not is a whole other ball of wax and I mean they've gone
[826.18 → 831.24] back on a lot of the strategies that they were talking about there, but I mean all of this is sort
[831.24 → 835.88] of very interesting except that we're not going to see any of the fruits of this acquisition for quite a
[835.88 → 843.78] while I mean look at the Motorola acquisition by Google yeah we're just now getting the Moto X that's the first
[843.78 → 849.46] device that's actually the product of that acquisition as opposed to being something that
[849.46 → 856.62] Motorola have in the pipeline already so let's go ahead I want to hear I want to hear what folks have to say on that
[856.62 → 865.78] Twitter blitz right there so we got 77 tweets here we go someone says I'm not 16, so I don't buy cars, but I'll be buying a used car when I get one
[865.78 → 872.26] if I had the money I would buy brand new it would be all mine and that's a nice feeling okay I agree
[872.26 → 876.58] that that's a nice feeling, but that's a very expensive feeling my nice feeling is having that
[876.58 → 881.10] amount of money in my bank account yeah that I would have saved that's a nice feeling and like the four
[881.10 → 887.20] vacations that I could go on well I guess if you could have could afford both Mr. Lamb says definite
[887.20 → 894.70] definitely used if I bought a car be secondhand because I'm a student I'm mechanically implied inclined, so I
[894.70 → 900.22] would definitely go for a used car as long as it works fine isn't an eyesore to look at it's fine for me
[900.22 → 907.58] someone says every time I open my browser there's an echo huh that's interesting don't see anything
[907.58 → 917.42] hmm is it Firefox no okay well at any rate let's go back to let's go back to our Twitter blitz someone
[917.42 → 921.52] says your stream is on in the background you know what I think it's its coming through these headphones
[921.52 → 927.84] so I'm going to go ahead and shut those down okay newer is usually better everyone loves shiny and
[927.84 → 933.12] untainted however if it works why pay thousands more okay a vehicle is already the worst investment
[933.12 → 937.44] of money possible best to minimize the amount of money you're spending never bought a car because
[937.44 → 943.52] I'm just 16 wow we got a lot of young viewers today new car you get warranties and bonuses used
[943.52 → 949.60] equals higher chance it has fault in the warranty okay maybe because you can buy new cars that still carry
[949.60 → 954.88] warranty used cars yes and many used cars even if they don't carry their original warranty
[954.88 → 958.40] if you're buying the used car from a dealership it can come with a dealership warranty that'll last
[958.40 → 965.84] for about three months yeah so I mean I totally disagree with you, I'm definitely on the but if
[965.84 → 971.12] you buy if you buy a used car from a random person it is highly likely that it will not have any form of
[971.12 → 976.48] warranty on it yes that may be true depends on what condition he's talking about someone says new
[976.48 → 982.08] more fancy that way uh buying a used car is the best investment ever I paid less for my car than my
[982.08 → 988.24] computer used in good condition okay, so basically people are pretty much uh pretty much in agreement
[988.24 → 995.60] on all this that used is the way to go however of course there is the uh there is always that sort of
[995.60 → 1001.20] that that brand-new feeling, and I've done it before not on anything as big ticket as a car but
[1002.00 → 1006.88] yeah I've definitely done it before it's like yeah I could get this cheaper but uh I'm gonna
[1006.88 → 1012.16] get this no okay do you want to cover android KitKat android is there's not a ton to cover there no, no
[1012.16 → 1018.16] just the uh the the the partnership, so guys check this out as far as I know there's no real
[1018.16 → 1023.44] money changing hands which is a fascinating part, but they're making a bunch of different
[1023.44 → 1031.92] they're making uh what is it android shaped KitKat bars yeah so they're going to have 50 million
[1031.92 → 1040.56] specially marked and or especially marked KitKat bars with uh with android androids on them um it's
[1040.56 → 1046.32] going to be part of like a promotional deal, so the idea is that google and nestle are going to be
[1046.32 → 1053.28] contributing both ways to make this beneficial for everybody there's also going to be 500
[1054.08 → 1060.48] specially produced chitchats in the shape of the android logo that nestle is claiming took weeks to
[1060.48 → 1066.88] create in a secret location, so these are like i don't know like handmade or something they've apparently
[1066.88 → 1074.64] been in talks about this since 2012 so it was like something ridiculous i don't know why it matters
[1074.64 → 1079.92] or something they've apparently been well it's great marketing for KitKat i don't see it being
[1079.92 → 1084.80] that fantastic marketing for android no matter what dessert they chose they would have gotten
[1085.52 → 1091.20] an incredible amount of news like i don't see this being super beneficial for android for me the
[1091.20 → 1099.76] funny thing to me is that it took so long for nestle to decide about this um when to me, it is pretty
[1099.76 → 1104.64] much a no-brainer yeah nestle should have done this like i think it took them over a year to
[1104.64 → 1110.56] decide i understand there are challenges so in North America for example Hershey is actually the owns the
[1110.56 → 1116.96] distribution rights for KitKat bars so you know Hershey's not getting anything out of this you know
[1116.96 → 1124.08] maybe the challenge is i don't know um printing those labels and re-ka jiggering whatever it is that they
[1124.08 → 1129.44] have to redo in order to change a label um, but it seems to me like just the most obvious thing in the
[1129.44 → 1136.32] world especially for them for android like I'd want money I'd want lots of money well that was
[1136.32 → 1141.20] our initial discussion before i found out that they didn't pay anything for it was well how much do you
[1141.20 → 1148.00] think this cost uh nestle nothing that's so weird because like i just said android could have picked
[1148.00 → 1153.84] any dessert it doesn't matter they could have gone cream puff and like it would have gotten 10 billion
[1153.84 → 1159.20] different networks talking about it well there is the whole uh letter letters corresponding to revisions
[1159.20 → 1165.20] right yeah okay so they were the rumour and uh google even referred to it internally as key lime pie
[1165.20 → 1170.80] was that it was going to be key lime pie but apparently key lime pie wasn't recognizable enough
[1170.80 → 1177.68] or something so i don't know i wonder in terms of co-branding like is this opening up like a whole
[1177.68 → 1185.44] like ball of wax like our candy companies going to be lining up to create like a huge like candy and
[1185.44 → 1194.96] like create a craze around it to like align with an upcoming android like Mr big nexus or uh Mr big
[1194.96 → 1200.80] why can't I remember the name of it for but those big phones easel has one oh no Mr big note
[1200.80 → 1205.20] yeah, or it's like, and it's like a note for, but it's called Mr big note or something like that like how uh
[1206.08 → 1210.24] how crazy is this going to get in terms of co-branding i don't have a clear answer
[1210.80 → 1216.64] to that right there so we have our guest coming up in about five minutes, but we've got time for one
[1216.64 → 1223.28] more topic before we get into that why don't we jump into the dram plant fire, so this was an article on
[1223.28 → 1229.36] tweak town so for those of you who aren't familiar with the way that commodities work um if you can find
[1229.36 → 1236.88] ram for cheap jump into um someone says still a lot of echo yeah i have no idea where it's coming from
[1238.56 → 1243.52] the second you open this browser minimize that minimize this okay
[1244.96 → 1250.96] okay so it's when I'm screen sharing, so there's no echo right now apparently
[1250.96 → 1261.28] which makes none oh there it is wow okay well my bad wow all right so here we go best strip
[1261.28 → 1267.52] size no that's not what i want okay uh okay so for those of you who aren't familiar with how Unix works
[1267.52 → 1274.08] or Unix ah see now I'm all confused how commodities work supply and demand is pretty much the name
[1274.08 → 1280.48] of the game uh d ram manufacturers um i mean you know you can kind of point at any commodity
[1280.48 → 1287.04] and go okay it's possible for supply to so far outstrip demand that they could be selling at a loss but
[1287.68 → 1294.08] traditionally the d ram guys the flash guys before flash just went completely crazy and is in every
[1294.08 → 1300.80] device ever could even be operating at a loss because it cost you less to be running the fabs at full
[1300.80 → 1309.68] capacity and selling for a small loss than it did to not be running the fabs so all right so that's fine
[1309.68 → 1316.48] but when production capacity goes down, and you can see here there's a big fire and there's a lot of smoke
[1316.48 → 1322.32] that dramatically affects the price of whatever that commodity happens to be so Unix supports something
[1322.32 → 1330.72] along the lines of one third of the world's d ram needs and including um i think they were saying this
[1330.72 → 1337.84] this particular facility was providing pretty much everything for apple um it was uh it was going
[1337.84 → 1342.40] to be shipping out to any number of different devices we're going to have the memory here integrated
[1342.40 → 1348.40] anything from you know obviously upcoming graphics cards was another one that could be affected by this
[1348.40 → 1354.24] even toys for the holiday season could be affected by anything that could possibly utilize those chips
[1354.24 → 1358.24] anything that could possibly utilize those chips will be affected by this and this is something i didn't
[1358.24 → 1367.04] think about but apparently the issue is not so much the fire but actually the smoke so the smoke damage
[1367.04 → 1372.80] i mean think about a clean room where you're allowed to have sort of you know like a handful like actually
[1372.80 → 1378.88] you can count them on your hand you can have like a handful of particles floating around
[1378.88 → 1384.48] that are not like oxygen nitrogen like gases that are existed in the atmosphere
[1384.48 → 1388.96] um in order to in order to classify as a clean room and in order to manufacture these products
[1389.52 → 1394.24] okay so now like dump a bunch of smoke in their like you got to look at something like that and go
[1394.24 → 1402.88] like what's the process for even cleaning it at that point like are you better off just like gutting it and
[1402.88 → 1408.40] like building a new one almost like how can you even clean it for clean rooms i actually wonder
[1408.40 → 1414.16] probably take the walls down like don't rebuild the whole building but like just you probably have to get rid of that stuff
[1414.16 → 1419.52] because i guess they're not using drywall Lexi think about how long something smells like smoke
[1419.52 → 1424.56] even once you get it all off even if there's just a little bit left on it like i this is going to be a
[1424.56 → 1429.84] big problem, and you know think about what happened with hard drives during the Thailand floods where prices
[1429.84 → 1436.40] doubled tripled overnight um it took well over a year for pricing to settle back into where it was
[1436.40 → 1441.60] pre-flood to the point where now hard drives are super cheap again but d-ram is going to be doing the same
[1441.60 → 1447.68] thing guys so if you can find any ram on the cheap go do it now the second i read this article i checked
[1447.68 → 1453.76] NCI the ram was the same price but i don't expect that to last that long it won't last forever believe
[1453.76 → 1459.44] me it will not last forever so uh you know find someone who's selling it used or figure out how
[1459.44 → 1463.76] to pull the trigger pretty quickly if you do need a memory upgrade because this will affect things for
[1463.76 → 1470.00] quite a long time so i think we're pretty much ready to have uh to have tiny tom call into the show I'm
[1470.00 → 1476.08] just going to go ahead and grab his lower third here i actually am not a hundred percent sure how
[1476.08 → 1482.72] uh how i can get this in here quickly oh boom you can drag and drop in x split i had no idea maybe
[1482.72 → 1488.72] that's new there you go so we're going to go ahead and fire up comes here so I'm supposed to join this
[1488.72 → 1499.44] one there we go and then invite him all right inviting tiny tom there he is boom, and we are turning this bad
[1499.44 → 1504.08] boy on
[1504.08 → 1510.88] all right, so yeah microphone blue snowball do not auto adjust because we've had problems with that
[1510.88 → 1519.28] before all right toms are you there he is not connected to mike, but we also have apparently no
[1519.28 → 1523.92] mic signal we also have no mic signal you've got to be kidding me i thought you guys uh i thought you
[1523.92 → 1532.24] guys did a test call here we did oh okay so uh did you happen to do the test call with the
[1532.24 → 1540.72] configuration that we're using uh kind of yeah kind of ah yes okay from now on test calls are done
[1540.72 → 1545.12] with exactly the audio configuration that we're going to be using because that will make everything
[1545.12 → 1551.92] better and that will be good and then everyone will be happy so in the meantime guys why don't
[1551.92 → 1558.24] you blitz us on Twitter so it's uh at Linus tech on Twitter let us know if you have any questions for
[1558.24 → 1562.96] tiny tom or if there's anything you want to say to him in general we will be doing at least one twitter
[1562.96 → 1567.52] blitz with him where we can go through and answer some of your questions so that's going to be a heck of
[1567.52 → 1574.40] a lot of fun once we get this going and of course when you're on when you're under the gun when the
[1574.40 → 1583.12] pressure's on it's always trickier to get things working yes, yes awesome stuff there we go all right
[1583.12 → 1586.24] so we're on voice chat tom are you there are you with me
[1589.68 → 1595.68] he's he's not uh he's in the chat, but he has not clicked because you'll see the mic symbol beside him
[1595.68 → 1602.32] if he's actually joined ah yes okay so let's go ahead and hey are you ready
[1606.00 → 1611.36] turn on your mic ratty are you ready hey spelling is not a strong point for me
[1612.48 → 1619.20] i think it was your typing angle okay well thank you all right in the meantime why don't we cover
[1619.20 → 1624.64] something else that's really, really brief here oh says my mic is on
[1625.68 → 1632.80] uh here maybe I'll just try calling him here sure and you and i can just get like real cozy here
[1632.80 → 1637.60] can you hear me now invite me to this chat can you hear him yes i can, you can just invite me to this
[1637.60 → 1638.64] chat hey guys
[1642.56 → 1648.32] well that was enthusiastic thank you so much for joining us here on the show how are you doing today
[1648.88 → 1653.84] I'm actually exhausted it's just after 1am in the morning you're very lucky to have me up this
[1653.84 → 1661.12] late at night and not be in a nightclub that, and it's been a pretty busy period lately do you want
[1661.12 → 1665.92] to jump right into our first topic here which is ivy bridge e you've uh probably spent a fair bit of
[1665.92 → 1673.36] time on this go I've actually been told to say that slick is fired because of the audio problems at the
[1673.36 → 1685.28] beginning but yes we can go straight into uh 2011 if you like let's let's do this so we um i mean honestly
[1685.28 → 1693.44] between you and me i mean were you expecting any better than what we got um it's a bit of a difficult
[1693.44 → 1699.52] one really i was really hoping as most people were i was hoping the overclocking was going to be better
[1699.52 → 1705.84] um to the point that when i got my sample from intel and i told them what my original results were
[1705.84 → 1714.16] uh because I've I've had a selection of CPUs now they uh i said to him, I'm i can get 4.5 really easy
[1714.16 → 1719.44] 1.3 volts it's going to be you know i mean that in itself is a little bit disappointing
[1719.44 → 1726.96] but I'm needing a lot more volts to get beyond that and uh yeah so i told them that i spoke to
[1726.96 → 1732.24] some Asus engineers, and we are actually talking quite well again at the minute um, and they sent
[1732.24 → 1739.92] me some more CPUs and i still struggle to get you know 4.6 out of it but i suppose the thing that we
[1739.92 → 1749.76] need to kind of remember is a lot of people kinds of fixate on the i can only get 4.4 or 4.5 or 4.6
[1749.76 → 1756.40] gigahertz, but it is still keeping up with the really, really quick overclocking versions of the
[1756.40 → 1761.76] previous generation so it really depends on you know what you're going to be expecting from your
[1761.76 → 1771.28] chip so tell me this then um in an ideal world what would you have wanted to see from intel because
[1771.28 → 1777.52] for those of you who haven't sort of read any reviews about ivy bridge e or who know much about it intel has
[1777.52 → 1784.72] taken the approach where instead of using an eight core CPU like they did on sandy bridge e and fusing off
[1784.72 → 1792.56] two of the cores so it's a effective six core intel has actually reduced the die size of ivy bridge e in
[1792.56 → 1799.12] two ways so it's a native six core now and then number two is they have actually shrunk the manufacturing
[1799.12 → 1806.96] process so from a cost perspective intel has kept pricing the same they have improved performance
[1806.96 → 1811.36] slightly, but they have dramatically lowered their cost of manufacturing this chip
[1811.36 → 1817.84] do you feel like you're getting an enthusiast grade product here tom uh it's a really difficult
[1817.84 → 1825.52] one actually because uh the reason why they are fused off the two cores before was because
[1825.52 → 1836.00] essentially they made one wafer for all the 2011 chips the 3820 the 3930 3960 70 and all the eons
[1836.00 → 1840.88] and that that was the point i was just about to get to they were all the same all they ever did was
[1840.88 → 1847.60] speed bin which actually kept prices down um, and we've obviously not seen yet whether we're going to
[1847.60 → 1855.60] get um uh sandy bridge e eons with eight cores or not and i think that's really the point that we you
[1855.60 → 1860.72] know that that will be the point that we know you know what intel's got planned because it's now making
[1860.72 → 1867.92] me wonder whether the eons are going to be uh much, much lower power use but possibly more cores because
[1867.92 → 1875.52] there was talk a little while ago of um them maybe getting up to that 10 core marker uh so again it's
[1875.52 → 1881.84] still very kind of up in the air and we don't know you know really what's going on yet but from the
[1881.84 → 1890.24] enthusiast point of view i don't think that we've really got um too much to moan about because if
[1890.24 → 1897.28] you've got enough money to buy a 4960x in the first place you're not really going to be worrying about
[1897.28 → 1904.96] you know if it does 4.5 or 4.6 gigahertz all you're really going to be worrying about is uh the speed of
[1904.96 → 1909.60] your ram because obviously the memory controller is much, much better on this generation
[1909.60 → 1917.52] uh all of my original three sorry all of my original 2011s so the 3960s and the 3930ks i
[1917.52 → 1924.80] struggled to get above 2133 so you'd have to do the base clock overclocking to be able to get past that
[1924.80 → 1933.12] 2133 marker whereas the 4960x i could literally just go into the bios put 1.65 volts into the memory
[1933.12 → 1941.12] voltages manually set my memory timings and just literally select 2400 megahertz and every single
[1941.12 → 1947.36] one of the CPUs i got would instantly boot up at 24 and that was even with uh all the overclocked
[1947.36 → 1954.08] enabled as well, so the memory controller is much, much stronger um but the other thing that we need to
[1954.08 → 1962.88] kind of bear in mind is yeah okay the overclocks are um not great, but they are as quick as much
[1962.88 → 1970.40] faster previous generations, but they're also using a lot less power um we were noticing kind of at least
[1970.40 → 1982.08] 50 watts difference between uh the uh sandy bridge sorry the the the original 2011s and then these newer ones so the 3960x and then the 4960x so for them to be as quick
[1982.08 → 1990.32] so for them to be as quick with lower clocks um and then using less power that they have made a little
[1990.32 → 1997.84] bit of a step forward and to be honest i think it's just ivy bridge and sandy bridge uh 1155 chips all over
[1997.84 → 2004.56] again so i pretty much think anyone could have made these reviews even before the processors come out if
[2004.56 → 2011.28] we really wanted to take an educated guess one thing to add in defence of them although as a consumer i don't
[2011.28 → 2016.64] think anyone would care is uh or that much at least if you're buying one of these expensive chips is the
[2016.64 → 2020.56] lower power john like you're talking about if you're is you're running servers you can get charged per
[2020.56 → 2027.04] wattage I'm getting this information from wind speed, but he's completely correct um so 120 watt draw at
[2027.04 → 2033.52] per you're getting 20 a month increase okay getting a bit again i mean most of the people watching
[2033.52 → 2039.36] are not running server blades yeah i mean these are people who are that's what I'm saying like for
[2039.36 → 2046.16] consumer none of them are really going to care but yeah the average gamer well the average user
[2046.16 → 2051.92] that's going to be using um one of these CPUs at home isn't really going to care the only time that
[2051.92 → 2060.48] uh the lower power usage is really going to make any difference is if for example um you're like Creek
[2060.48 → 2066.00] because they're based in the UK and i know they're just about to upgrade they've got a absolute ton
[2066.00 → 2075.44] of 4960x is just about to go in um and when you've got that many uh running at max for so long then you
[2075.44 → 2080.88] are going to make a saving on your electric bill but for someone that's you know buying it for home and
[2080.88 → 2085.68] is going to be running three or four 780s they've obviously got enough money that they're not going to
[2085.68 → 2090.00] be worrying about an extra 50 pound on their electric bill at the end of the month right
[2090.00 → 2095.36] exactly, and you know what part it's funny you bring this up because we don't uh we don't have many
[2095.36 → 2100.24] guests that are from different regions because you're talking a lot about power savings whereas
[2100.24 → 2108.24] here in Canada where most of our power comes from the like falling water that's just everywhere um
[2108.24 → 2114.00] our power is phenomenally cheap i mean we're talking about when i crunch the numbers even based on
[2114.00 → 2119.76] California which is i think about two or three x the power cost that we have here in British Columbia
[2120.64 → 2126.96] getting an 80 plus gold power supply versus an 80 plus or even like non-80 plus power supply we were
[2126.96 → 2134.80] talking it was going to pay for itself in like eight years so from my perspective i give almost zero
[2134.80 → 2143.52] cares about you know the dollar fifty or five bucks that this is going to cost me per quarter to run
[2143.52 → 2150.64] instead of something that you know consumes a little bit less power um tell me give me
[2150.64 → 2158.24] your thoughts then on Haswell e because like you said you or i could have done an ivy bridge e review
[2158.24 → 2162.56] a year ago easily so Haswell e do we already know the answer
[2164.64 → 2171.28] uh i can probably put a lot of um you want to maybe want to watch the chat now on the right-hand side
[2171.28 → 2175.36] because i think a lot of people may start to get a little bit angry with me but i don't think
[2176.24 → 2183.28] essentially the reason why uh ivy bridge e has taken so long to come out was because intel hasn't got any
[2183.28 → 2192.64] competition um so uh that they actively delayed it because uh AMD didn't really have anything to
[2192.64 → 2200.72] kind of uh compete with if it was very much like when the 680 come out uh that was meant to have been a
[2200.72 → 2210.64] uh much lower end card and kind of uh essentially what happened is NVIDIA um they saw the 770
[2210.64 → 2216.56] the 7970 when that come out and they kind of went oh uh that's not as good as we were expecting and
[2216.56 → 2223.20] they kind of juggled all the product line around and that was why when the 680 come out it was
[2223.20 → 2230.00] almost identical to the 7970 um because they kind of i think the rumours were it was meant to have been
[2230.00 → 2238.32] originally the 760 and that was why the um uh sorry it was meant to have been the 660 that's it
[2238.32 → 2241.60] yeah I'm getting all my numbers mixed up it's too late it's like quarter past one in the morning
[2242.64 → 2250.08] um, but that was why the uh 670 and the 660 had that much shorter PCB was because they were obviously
[2250.08 → 2259.44] they were meant to have been much lower cards um but yeah obviously when uh x79 first got released
[2259.44 → 2264.16] i don't know whether a lot of your readers or even whether you were you know whether you know the
[2264.16 → 2271.28] kind of background behind all the motherboard and the chipset problems um but intel changed the x79
[2271.28 → 2278.80] chipset uh numerous times on the run-up to the CPUs being released because originally it was meant to
[2278.80 → 2286.64] have PCR express 3 originally it was meant to have USB 3 uh all on the chipset and intel kept running
[2286.64 → 2292.56] into problems and they kept changing it which was why when the 2011 socket originally come out loads of
[2292.56 → 2298.00] the motherboards either they didn't have the full range out or like gigabyte they were still running
[2298.00 → 2305.92] around with terrible biases and because stuff hadn't fully got tested so with this one where AMD didn't
[2305.92 → 2312.00] have you know really anything to compete with because even their silly um five gigahertz chips
[2312.00 → 2317.84] still can't really compete with you know anything in the extreme sector of the intel range even though
[2317.84 → 2323.52] you know the price is similar intel yeah well the price has dropped now so i think it's not in all
[2323.52 → 2328.72] territories but intel slash prices on those chips by like four hundred dollars or something stupid like
[2328.72 → 2333.92] i know that was yeah that was AMD but i think pretty much that was because AMD it was a very, very good
[2333.92 → 2339.76] marketing strategy because AMD put the prices out originally and i I've spoken to retailers in the
[2339.76 → 2346.80] UK, and they were still selling those extreme chips um really kind of got in yeah they kind of got in
[2346.80 → 2352.88] and got their money when they could before uh sandy bridge e come out, and then they just slashed the
[2352.88 → 2358.48] prices because they know that they're they're not going to they're not going to sell them afterwards and
[2358.48 → 2364.40] um one of my friends a very good friend of mine is actually works for AMD, and he said to me
[2364.40 → 2371.84] we are not going to be sending those out for review at all because we know if a decent reviewer
[2371.84 → 2376.96] gets hold of these they're gonna they're going to cut them to bits, and we're not going to sell any and we just
[2376.96 → 2382.96] if it was yeah they just needed to get rid of them it was just a classic am doh we're going to do this
[2382.96 → 2389.60] and hope the fanboys buy it oh I'm going to get in a lot of problems aren't I I'm going to wake up in the
[2389.60 → 2395.76] morning to an absolute inbox for the complaints but the reality of it is i don't disagree with you at
[2395.76 → 2401.52] all so for those of you who are watching and are you know like preparing your fingers to write angry
[2401.52 → 2409.60] letters to tom um the cold hard truth of the matter is that those chips were never designed to run at
[2409.60 → 2415.28] those speeds you look at the power consumption those the boards that go with those chips were
[2415.28 → 2421.12] never designed to deliver that kind of power this platform was never intended to do this it's not a
[2421.12 → 2428.00] real product it's like it's like if you were to pay AMD's engineers to come to your house and overclock
[2428.00 → 2433.28] your CPU for you that's basically what you were paying for when you gave them your extra few hundred bucks
[2433.28 → 2439.76] yeah when i got my original uh i think it may have been I'd have to check my videos i think
[2439.76 → 2448.24] it was the h350 the heat that that thing consumed uh sorry created was insane, and they did make it
[2448.24 → 2455.36] slightly better with the like the newer variant um but i said at that point in time i was still testing
[2455.36 → 2467.92] on a hd14 air cooler and i did need two 220 CFM uh, uh manifolds was it manifolds anyway two 220 CFM fans
[2467.92 → 2475.68] two hair dryer just to keep the Noctua cool they were server spec fans it was insane the amount
[2475.68 → 2481.44] of noise i was creating just because i had really pushed the overclocks on that chip so when they brought
[2481.44 → 2489.20] out that five gigahertz CPU i was just like you would have to be insane to spend that much money
[2489.76 → 2496.88] on uh on a processor where the architecture is already kind of like you know 18 months or two
[2496.88 → 2504.48] years behind the stuff that intel's given us um you know even at the basic kind of extreme level which
[2504.48 → 2509.52] for the matter you said earlier you didn't know what the e stands for it most definitely is extreme
[2509.52 → 2515.76] ah okay well there you go so I'm going to throw something at you this is totally unrelated because
[2515.76 → 2521.44] i want to move on to Bradwell pretty quick here but um are you telling me I'm talking too much Linus
[2521.44 → 2526.80] no not at all I'm just i this is hilarious and i want to show it to the viewers who have never seen
[2526.80 → 2534.32] it before, so tom was saying he needed to use some server spec fans on his nhd14 um tom is this before
[2534.32 → 2540.88] you came up with the concept of mounting more fans in order to get some ambient cooling i already know
[2540.88 → 2549.28] what's coming so guys this is a little experiment with a h100 and uh how many fans did you have on
[2549.28 → 2556.48] there man uh actually that is um that's a very early version because there was uh 20 fans on one side i
[2556.48 → 2563.20] think if you count you can see 10 yeah and if you go a little bit further into the video we go completely
[2563.20 → 2567.68] crazy, and we put another 20 on the other side so you may want to skip a little bit further in
[2568.48 → 2568.96] there we go
[2572.40 → 2580.96] um essentially what the idea with that was is it was just to have a little bit of fun um but i really
[2580.96 → 2588.40] did not uh i expect that that that's quite literally the most popular video I've ever made
[2588.40 → 2593.92] um and I'm actually a little bit disappointed that the most popular video I've ever made is the one
[2593.92 → 2602.00] that was a complete and utter troll because yeah okay so viewers let me just be really
[2602.00 → 2610.72] clear about this water cooling no matter how amazing it is if you're using the surrounding air to cool it
[2610.72 → 2618.16] is essentially still air cooling so you're still air cooling your CPU sort of your water cooling
[2618.16 → 2624.24] the chip itself then you're pumping that heat over to a much larger surface area than you could achieve
[2624.24 → 2630.08] by mounting it directly to the CPU, and then you're going to air cool that so tom in this troll video is
[2630.08 → 2634.56] all like well if i put more fans on it then it'll be like what did you claim it was like negative
[2634.56 → 2641.28] temperatures yeah essentially well basically um we took a version of hardware monitor, and we took
[2641.28 → 2646.72] it apart and basically any of the temperatures that were there and if you go to the end of the video
[2646.72 → 2652.72] because people still haven't seen this if you go to the end of the video there is a disclaimer just
[2652.72 → 2657.28] before people start trolling me if it was a bit of fun, and it was always that way all along, but we took
[2657.28 → 2663.20] hardware monitor apart uh, and we basically told hardware monitor to make the temperatures i can't
[2663.20 → 2668.48] remember whether it was 80 degrees below what it should have been or 140 degrees below what it should
[2668.48 → 2676.08] have been so basically we we we displayed these temperatures, and they weren't exactly you know
[2676.64 → 2684.48] true but at the end of the video we did kind of admit it but the i exactly, exactly that you are made
[2684.48 → 2693.04] detail um essentially we just said because of the static pressure um it could
[2693.04 → 2698.80] create amazing ambient temperatures and i really wasn't prepared for the amount of people that
[2698.80 → 2705.44] might believe it to the point that there are videos on YouTube now where people have tried to
[2705.44 → 2712.40] replicate the results and i kind of feel a little bit guilty no way is there actually yeah I've had
[2712.40 → 2719.04] people send me links to videos, and they're like i can't get my uh my temperatures to go below ambient
[2719.04 → 2728.64] um just so that your readers know if you add an uh a second set of high speed fans so you've got push
[2728.64 → 2736.32] pull, and you add a just another four fans on not you know like 20 or 18 more just another two fans on
[2736.32 → 2739.52] i only managed to get one degree off
[2742.96 → 2749.12] oh man a bunch more money well I'm sorry man i hate to dig up this sort of painful thing from your
[2749.12 → 2755.84] past but no it's perfect because it was a lot of fun i just wasn't prepared for the amount of
[2755.84 → 2762.80] people that took it serious because i did put a disclaimer at the end and i mean I'm going to look now
[2762.80 → 2772.24] just to kind of see on the analytics of the uh of my channel which is your readers want to put www.oc3d.tv
[2772.96 → 2778.96] in it will take them straight to my channel but the ultimate corsair coolant mod has had 22 000 views
[2778.96 → 2786.00] in the last month that's amazing those are such big numbers for a year or for a video that is going to
[2786.00 → 2794.24] be one year old in 13 days it's actually my most popular it's either my number one or my number two
[2794.24 → 2800.88] most popular view uh video of all time and uh I'd kind of like it to have been one of the reviews to be
[2800.88 → 2806.56] fair speaking of reviews um I'd love for you to take a moment before we jump into Bradwell which will be
[2806.56 → 2813.28] our next topic to tell the audience what you do how they find you on the YouTube and what your channel's
[2813.28 → 2819.68] all about pimp it okay um if we go right back to the very beginning because i obviously started the
[2819.68 → 2825.36] channel when i was uh in a shed it literally in the middle of nowhere it was a really, really bad camera
[2825.36 → 2831.52] really, really bad lighting um, and it was just because uh i couldn't um i wanted to start just
[2831.52 → 2838.16] making uh i what used to watch Rodney Reynolds and i used to see the empty cases and the five minute
[2838.16 → 2844.64] reviews um and i would watch one of them and i would find that i was uh getting more questions
[2844.64 → 2850.96] at the end of the review than i was getting answers so i just kind of wanted to you know do my own spin
[2850.96 → 2857.20] on it and go against the MTD generation which was meant to have been three or four-minute videos
[2857.20 → 2863.60] and then just kind of make my own really in-depth ones and to be fair i still to this point i know i could
[2863.60 → 2868.40] make you know because OCD is a business now do you know what i mean and there's no you can't get
[2868.40 → 2874.16] away from that fact, and you can't, you know put me down because you know i need to make money now I've
[2874.16 → 2879.28] spent a lot of money trying to build this up and buy the website and stuff but believe it or not i can
[2879.28 → 2886.40] relate essentially from one kind of website owner to another it's obviously you've you started with
[2886.40 → 2893.12] NCI i started working with OCD and then i had the opportunity to buy it out which was in
[2893.12 → 2898.40] December but I've always stayed I've always wanted to do that in-depth thing and if you're going to
[2898.40 → 2905.52] buy a 550 pound graphics card like the 780, or you're going to spend you know a hundred pound or 200 pound
[2905.52 → 2911.68] on a case um you can get the tight you know you can get the uh compact details from a lot of other
[2911.68 → 2917.36] reviews and there's nothing wrong with any of the other ones um but if you want to know the ins and
[2917.36 → 2923.12] ounce of a duck's bum and kind of see that kind of understanding of how they're put together and
[2923.12 → 2930.00] the engineering and the understanding about how much they cost to make that's the kind of really
[2930.00 → 2936.24] niche area that i take you know that i kind of get, and it was one of the questions i was going to ask you
[2936.24 → 2944.00] actually because i always get people in my comments saying uh tom i really like your videos, but they're
[2944.00 → 2951.44] too long can you make shorter ones um but can you honestly imagine me trying to squeeze let's take
[2951.44 → 2958.00] okay i did purposely go overboard on the 900d i was about to say 900d that was like an hour 45 or
[2958.00 → 2963.36] something like that yeah it was that was actually that was actually George from corsair he kind of said to
[2963.36 → 2970.40] me we want to make it feature length and i i i did go into more detail than i wanted to
[2970.40 → 2977.44] to be fair but can you imagine me trying to shrink that video down to 20 minutes it just i couldn't
[2977.44 → 2982.24] have got it all in there was a lot to talk about and to be fair i could make another one at least
[2982.24 → 2988.08] another 30 minutes long about stuff that i didn't cover, and you know what that's i think this is this
[2988.08 → 2994.88] is actually a great topic of conversation because viewers will ask me why i don't do reviews it's come
[2994.88 → 3001.28] up on the forum a few times Linus why don't you do your reviews and my answer is invariably unboxing
[3001.28 → 3007.04] and brief product overviews where it's here's the basics of what you need to know here's a nice close
[3007.04 → 3012.00] look at it so you know what you're getting that you know what you're getting yourself into that's what
[3012.00 → 3018.80] made us big that's what has grown our business and our channel and our viewer base and that's what
[3018.80 → 3024.88] our viewers are telling us they're clicking that button that says i like this um let's face it
[3024.88 → 3030.64] minus you've got you've nearly got half a million subscribers there's no way that you can get away
[3030.64 → 3038.56] from you know the success and exactly the thing is with mine is i know I've got a very, very niche
[3038.56 → 3044.56] market which is why the amount of subscribers I've got I'm still humbled by every month when i look to
[3044.56 → 3051.68] see how many more I've got um but if i can help just a couple of people a month make an educated
[3051.68 → 3057.68] choice away from buying you know one product, and then they might go well actually i might not need that
[3057.68 → 3064.48] i can buy this product then as far as I'm concerned my job's done because the channel was originally
[3064.48 → 3071.68] started as a form of therapy for me when my mum died it was never you know started as um you know
[3071.68 → 3078.00] a way to make money, or you know buy a know UK website out or anything like that and that's still
[3078.00 → 3084.80] the kind of angle that i take and even that with my reviewers they've all kind of I'm not going to say
[3084.80 → 3089.92] change their opinions, but they've all they've all kind of you know engineered the angles that they
[3089.92 → 3095.12] take on reviews to make sure that they give people you know a broader spectrum and lots and lots of
[3095.12 → 3100.48] information rather than trying to make it you know really, really short and just say everything's amazing
[3100.48 → 3107.12] all the time and that's the last part of my whole thing is why don't I do in-depth reviews well because
[3107.12 → 3115.12] you can go watch Tom's, or you can go read on tech uh there 's's a hundred other guys that are
[3115.12 → 3122.08] doing it better than we could with the limited time we have left after we're doing brief overviews of
[3123.12 → 3129.84] so much stuff there's only so many hours in a day and i think that's i think that's another thing that
[3129.84 → 3136.88] a lot of people don't appreciate with the work that we do is the know stuff does take a long time
[3137.44 → 3143.68] um I've seen the sheer amount of videos that you guys have put out, and it's like how do they get time to
[3143.68 → 3148.96] do all that because i know my videos are a lot longer so they take a lot more time to render and
[3148.96 → 3154.72] all that kind of stuff, but you do put a lot of content out um, but it's almost i tell you something
[3154.72 → 3160.64] that's amazing we're alive I'll tell you something that would be quite interesting Linus would be for
[3160.64 → 3167.52] you to do a box opening and then for me to do the review directly after and let's both upload the video
[3167.52 → 3172.32] so there's a challenge for you, we should try that at some point we should try that as a cross
[3172.32 → 3179.04] promotional thing is like look work i mean our motherboard overviews we don't put a CPU in the
[3179.04 → 3186.56] board i you know i have to be upfront about that we're not going to do that um however if you're just
[3186.56 → 3192.16] looking at specs you don't need to no so we can cover the basics and then i can be like yo if you
[3192.16 → 3197.44] really want to know in more detail how far it overclocked with this particular CPU or whatever else
[3197.44 → 3203.04] Tom's got a video over there he doesn't have to worry as much about glam footage of this or specs
[3203.04 → 3209.20] that and can point people my way i don't see you have a problem with that, or you could actually you
[3209.20 → 3214.96] could do like the intro version of the review and i could do the end version of the review, and we could
[3214.96 → 3220.56] upload the same one as for argument's sake if corsair were to release a new case which I'm pretty sure
[3220.56 → 3226.80] you're aware is pretty soon you could do your intro i could do my review we could both send each other
[3226.80 → 3232.96] each other's um footage, and we could upload the same thing tell you what why don't we do that as a collab
[3232.96 → 3238.88] well hypothetically if there was a case coming spoiler alert hypothetically i think we both know there are
[3238.88 → 3244.16] and my skype has just gone eight so yeah I'm going to get in trouble in the morning
[3244.16 → 3251.84] the best bit about it is uh oh sorry you're probably going to save me from getting into trouble
[3251.84 → 3260.24] or would you like me to get into trouble go for it okay uh in my uh 350d video i did correctly name
[3260.24 → 3265.28] the upcoming model for the next corsair case, and it's actually behind me, and it's very good
[3266.08 → 3270.00] oh man there we go i wasn't saying that i was pointing at who was saying that
[3270.00 → 3276.72] all right lets didn't write NBA i didn't say anything let's move into our last topic here guys
[3277.20 → 3284.96] so this was submitted by skits 9417 on the forum and the basic news is the 22 nanometre Haswell
[3284.96 → 3289.28] processors have only been available to buy since June this year, but the focus is already shifting to
[3289.28 → 3295.76] intel's next generations of chips and chipsets nine series chipsets and Bradwell processors so intel's
[3295.76 → 3302.24] moving to 14 nanometers, and basically it's going to be LGA 1150 however
[3303.68 → 3310.88] new motherboard anyway no backwards compatibility your thoughts okay do you know why they're doing it
[3311.84 → 3315.76] well probably for much the same reason as every other time they've done it and this is something
[3315.76 → 3322.72] i wanted to get into so for those of you viewers who aren't aware of this um a socket change does not
[3322.72 → 3333.68] equal an electrical change so when AMD was going through that insanity of 939 to am2 to a2 plus and
[3333.68 → 3340.88] 3 plus and FM whatever it is when AMD had a bazillion sockets going on 1207 on the server side
[3342.16 → 3348.72] people were kind of pointing at intel going oh well intel had LGA 775 forever why can't AMD have a
[3348.72 → 3357.52] long-lasting socket like that wrong 775 went through several electrical changes that prevented previous
[3357.52 → 3363.76] boards from working with upcoming CPUs i mean just because it's the same socket doesn't mean it's the
[3363.76 → 3376.96] same thing so okay Bradwell uh okay uh with 775 uh I've got to admit i have run the entire range of
[3376.96 → 3386.40] 775 CPUs from pretty much like p65 upwards when they changed the chipsets they were adding
[3386.40 → 3392.56] stuff on and this was kind of the old ticktock version of what intel used to do like the p35 only
[3392.56 → 3398.96] used to have a limited amount of PCR express lanes but if you went up to x38 that was when you could then
[3398.96 → 3406.08] go into crossfire whereas with now they've kind of separated those uh parts into completely different
[3406.08 → 3414.72] sockets um this is very much a rumour that I've heard from uh motherboard manufacturers but i have
[3414.72 → 3421.28] heard that intel were kind of admitted that the problems that they've had with Haswell and the heat
[3421.28 → 3428.80] that they generated is because for the first time ever they moved the voltage regulator onto the CPU
[3429.44 → 3436.24] um and uh because of that i had heard that intel were going to take the voltage regulator off again
[3436.24 → 3441.84] because they wanted to drop that TDP back down because people were having such problems keeping
[3441.84 → 3449.04] them cool like with you know if you when you've done your own tests um uh if you use Oct you've only
[3449.04 → 3454.96] got to hit that AVX compatible mode, and you'll get and you know go from an acceptable 70 degrees temp
[3454.96 → 3461.84] up to a 95 or 100 degrees temp just because of the amount of extra stress it puts on the CPU and that
[3461.84 → 3467.60] also in you know in two means more power requirements and i really had to wonder what they were thinking
[3467.60 → 3475.12] I'm sorry just really briefly because you talk to someone like an NVIDIA with their implementation of GPU
[3475.12 → 3483.04] boost 2.0 where they kind of went well what kills chips voltage and heat and time and if you can reduce
[3483.04 → 3489.04] any one of those factors you can make your chip last longer and what intel went and did here is they
[3489.04 → 3498.80] increase heat so they say they took one of those pillars of CPU reliability and like were like
[3498.80 → 3507.20] sledgehammering the bottom of it for no apparent reason your thoughts uh actually uh when intel did that
[3507.20 → 3515.20] what they also did was they uh they really put a very hardcore throttling in place as well so if uh
[3515.20 → 3521.28] you're running your overclocks, and you hit that which is a hundred degree threshold if you know any of
[3521.28 → 3528.00] your users out there want to you know go and try it the CPU will get to about 100 or 102 degrees because
[3528.00 → 3533.44] it's always within a perfect percentage of the reader that you're using on your desktop it will than
[3533.44 → 3541.44] throttle back massively and the attempts will drop back to about 60 70 degrees, and then it will
[3541.44 → 3550.56] eventually go back up again and what we do need to remember is Haswell uh ivy bridge and sandy bridge
[3550.56 → 3558.24] they essentially when they changed over from the 1366 chipset they made this a lot easier for beginners
[3558.24 → 3567.28] to use because uh you'll remember with 1366 we had a lot of base clock options yes so in fact that's one
[3567.28 → 3575.04] of my most popular videos ever was my LGA 1366 overclocking guides because it was complicated, and it was
[3575.04 → 3583.36] totally different from anything we'd ever seen before uh yeah exactly and uh the problem was uh the
[3583.36 → 3590.48] the users that were buying the 1366 socket were running into issues whereas they were they were
[3590.48 → 3597.76] buying like a memory kit, and they couldn't get it to run it rated because uh the XMP profiles back then
[3597.76 → 3604.08] they weren't that strong and generally if you wanted to get your ram to run it rated you would need to do
[3604.08 → 3609.36] you know a little bit of overclocking and that did mean you know balancing the difference between your base
[3609.36 → 3615.36] clock and your memory strap to get your memory timings um and then if you got your ram running it
[3615.36 → 3619.84] rated, and then you tried to overclock a little bit more uh you'd start getting to the point where you
[3619.84 → 3626.32] know nothing was stable because your ram was starting to run out of spec so when they introduced
[3626.32 → 3632.56] sandy bridge and that very, very limited base clock where you add a hundred to the start to start with
[3632.56 → 3640.16] and you could only normally get like 103 or 104 out of it um everything that the reviewers were telling
[3640.16 → 3648.00] you was to leave the base clock alone because you've got that tie-in with 1600 1866 and 2133 memory and
[3648.56 → 3655.84] that whole reason that intel went across was to make it easier for a very big you know a learner or a
[3655.84 → 3661.84] beginner or someone that's not really had these type of systems before to be able to just go in and go
[3661.84 → 3667.92] actually i just want to run XMP, and it worked, and it was the know it was the first time really
[3667.92 → 3675.28] that they'd had you know near enough 100 success ratios that you could buy you know an decent uh
[3675.28 → 3680.16] memory kit, and it would run it was only the real extreme end of you know when you started getting to
[3680.16 → 3687.44] 2133 and beyond that it would come down to how lucky you got with your CPU so i actually think it was a
[3687.44 → 3696.24] very clever move with intel so do you see moving the arm on board as just an extension of that strategy
[3696.24 → 3703.28] of making it easier for the beginner than but then it just kind of didn't work out um i I'm honestly
[3703.28 → 3708.88] not sure what intel were trying to do with that i think it was probably to try and make maybe motherboards
[3708.88 → 3716.00] cheaper because the voltage regulator on the motherboard was so much bigger, and it did help to keep prices
[3716.00 → 3722.56] down i mean and another thing that we need to keep about is it didn't need such a big voltage
[3722.56 → 3729.92] regulator anymore because Haswell didn't draw as much power um the video that you did about the gigabyte
[3729.92 → 3738.08] z87i it board versus the Maximus 6 extreme the reason why the over clocks were the same was because the
[3738.08 → 3745.84] CPUs don't need as much power anymore and this is i get a kick out of it z87 boards with multiple
[3745.84 → 3754.24] CPU power connectors yeah exactly they're never going to get to that point pretty much every board
[3754.24 → 3762.00] out there if you're going to run even up to like dry ice you're going to get to the point where the CPU is
[3762.00 → 3769.60] going to stop before the motherboard does um and that's just because you know the CPUs are so power
[3769.60 → 3776.08] efficient now that even a basic motherboard with just a handful of phases can keep a decent overclock
[3776.08 → 3782.08] um right just because i know that you know the aces panel on my skype is flashing at the moment and
[3782.08 → 3788.00] to be fair there is quite a few of them there having a go at me if you do have more power phases long term
[3788.00 → 3793.60] the board is likely to last a little bit longer um, and you may have a slightly more stable overclock
[3793.60 → 3800.56] overclock long term, but this is one of the reasons why uh i kind of went with the middle ground
[3800.56 → 3809.84] and i say that the gigabyte uh m5 and the MSI gd65 gaming they're both 150 pounds in the UK
[3810.72 → 3816.96] they are more than anyone is really going to want, and you don't if you want to spend more money than that
[3816.96 → 3823.20] um it's not about you know the overclocking that you can get or the frames per second that you can get
[3823.20 → 3830.40] for spending more money it really does just come down to uh the looks of the board and possibly
[3830.40 → 3836.64] the features that you get as well which yeah as I'm sure you're perfectly aware for a reviewer if all
[3836.64 → 3843.52] the boards perform the same how are you meant to review it because yes you're trying to you're trying
[3843.52 → 3849.84] to sell a product which is a very personal choice so yes we kind of have to go rather than it being an
[3849.84 → 3856.40] easier thing to review we've now suddenly got to give a lot more details so that people can go
[3856.40 → 3861.76] actually yes you know that is a very good feature that i need to be purchasing i don't need that but i
[3861.76 → 3868.56] may need this, and they need to go and look for it absolutely all right well i think we're going to have to
[3868.56 → 3874.96] let you go thank you very much for joining us we really appreciate you taking the time and uh i hope you
[3874.96 → 3880.64] guys and who are viewing also enjoyed us having tiny tom on so guys just as can I just say one more
[3880.64 → 3888.72] thing yes, thank you very much uh if your uh viewers want to go to the OCD 3d website we are giving away
[3888.72 → 3897.52] a 780 and i will give away uh an exclusive kind of little bit of a hint or a tip live on the one show
[3897.52 → 3903.92] and I'm not going to post this on the forums but i will say that the uh the image that you're looking for
[3903.92 → 3912.96] is in something related to gigabyte all right that is a good tip all right thank you very much and guys
[3912.96 → 3919.12] uh give our guest a warm sort of thank you in the twitch chat because it sounds like he's checking it
[3919.12 → 3924.64] out and uh we'll talk to you soon man cheers dude thank you very much take care see you later bye-bye
[3924.64 → 3934.56] all right so without further ado let's head into our next topic here which is going to be
[3934.56 → 3943.28] the the the the the the the the the ah yes a couple of Kindle news items this week so i actually ordered one of
[3943.28 → 3947.84] these i don't know if uh here I'm just gonna yep there you go i don't know if i told you this but i
[3947.84 → 3954.32] ordered oh okay well this is a different link now it has actually it has actually changed um yeah no
[3954.32 → 3960.08] that doesn't matter we're good uh so i was looking for where's the other link oh here it is okay so
[3960.08 → 3965.92] they have a new paper white which is using a new display technology i know that that's not exactly the
[3965.92 → 3971.84] same kind of you know hardcore tech that we usually focus on this show but what oh for crying out loud
[3971.84 → 3979.04] okay well whatever the new paper white paperweight and then i think the first listing is like the old
[3979.04 → 3984.96] one or something stupid oh no there it is there it is so it's the new Kindle paper white so next
[3984.96 → 3990.96] generation screen so they're using what they're calling here we're just going to go back to this
[3990.96 → 3998.32] is their one where the light bounces yes so it's the new e-ink pearl 2 display so what this achieves is
[3998.32 → 4006.24] much brighter whites much darker blacks and effectively higher contrast because
[4006.24 → 4013.76] because that's how inherently that because that's how contrast works um, and then they've also
[4013.76 → 4019.52] increased the display density so it's 216 pixels per inch which might not sound that great, but you're
[4019.52 → 4026.40] not i mean you're looking at fonts that are going to be yeah it's not like full coloured photos, and it's
[4026.40 → 4032.00] it's its me well okay it's mainly book text like it'll be fine mainly book text they've increased
[4032.00 → 4037.76] the frequency from 800 megahertz to one gigahertz added more accurate touch um they've made some
[4037.76 → 4041.12] improvements to the battery so they're claiming you can get anywhere from i think it's like four to
[4041.12 → 4045.52] eight weeks depending on which model you're looking at now this is where things start to get
[4045.52 → 4050.00] interesting oh there's some more software and stuff it starts around 120 or 140 bucks or something like
[4050.00 → 4054.64] that sure this might not even be the right product page 120 bucks oh 120 bucks with special offers so
[4054.64 → 4058.96] that's what i paid for it um, but this is where things get fascinating when are we going
[4058.96 → 4064.32] to see this go everywhere they are selling a version that has an always-on 3g connection that you do not
[4064.32 → 4072.96] pay for yeah i bet you didn't know this okay so how this works and i have no idea how they're
[4072.96 → 4078.24] supporting this but I'm thinking maybe what Amazon has done is they've worked out an agreement with like
[4078.24 → 4085.44] every carrier everywhere to have 3g coverage on the paper white so that whether you're in the states
[4085.44 → 4090.88] there shouldn't be any roaming because it's not your plan so there must just be like a Kindle plan
[4090.88 → 4096.40] that's tied into the wireless radios on all these devices that could work anywhere so you can't just
[4096.40 → 4100.96] browse your internet yeah i was going to say you don't have that did I say browse your internet you
[4100.96 → 4106.24] did that was awesome pretty, pretty cool yeah uh but you can't just browse your email you can't browse the
[4106.24 → 4111.84] internet you can't do that but you can get books but you can buy yeah from Amazon you can buy books
[4111.84 → 4116.16] so they probably have this minor profit sharing thing going on smartest thing ever
[4116.16 → 4123.44] that's brilliant i did not know that like that's the smartest thing ever is like what always does on
[4123.44 → 4130.00] and connected everywhere even really mean we were down in Seattle and because of the horrendous costs of
[4130.64 → 4135.52] roaming with data or text or phone i mean we were effectively cut off from the world for four days
[4135.52 → 4145.36] yeah it was um sorry it was 40 to get a like plan for me basic through my company up here i
[4145.36 → 4150.56] had to pay them 40 bucks to try and get a plan over the border so it's like yeah ridiculous whereas
[4150.56 → 4157.20] this is the smartest thing ever i mean uh hey brandon he's got his headphones on do you want me to go
[4157.20 → 4163.12] get he has his headphones on um no it's okay I'll get him anyway talk about why this is smart because it
[4163.12 → 4170.16] works everywhere because no wrong he basically just said all why it's smart but the idea that i came
[4170.16 → 4176.08] up with which is a chance of how this works is the profit sharing thing because somehow Amazon has
[4176.08 → 4180.16] to be paying for this they have to be supported in some way because they're the only ones actually
[4180.16 → 4185.44] benefiting from this so if is they're paying for it out of pocket or if it's a profit sharing thing
[4185.44 → 4191.60] they're keeping it just to purchases that's why profit trade makes sense is this it what no it's
[4191.60 → 4198.48] oh it's this thing yes he has small hands so yeah so he's very excited oh I'm so stoked
[4200.56 → 4206.96] uh mini get open oh I'm not even on camera no like missing all the exciting like an
[4206.96 → 4212.24] unboxed who unboxes things off of camera i know right brilliant never mind i wanted you to get the door
[4212.24 → 4220.72] smart guy that's okay i got it you probably just heard you running around screaming one mini okay
[4220.72 → 4225.68] i probably always send it to you in little shopping bags i know right so like as if i shopped for it
[4225.68 → 4232.64] but uh i am so stoked if you guys have been watching me for any amount of time uh you'll know i love my
[4232.64 → 4241.20] htc1 um did have an evil device for a Samsung Galaxy s4 so yeah better battery yeah some cool gestures and
[4241.20 → 4249.84] stuff but i you know as a previous apple user you know i was like oh i miss that quality
[4249.84 → 4255.12] you know like that that sexiness which speaking of which i mean we're pretty much done with the Kindle
[4255.12 → 4260.64] thing right um yeah I'm done with it, i think there was one other thing something something something
[4260.64 → 4265.36] right matchbook rewards loyal Amazon customers for past present and future orders of physical books
[4265.36 → 4270.96] by offering digital ones on the cheap so like 99 cents to like three bucks or even free so if you've
[4270.96 → 4276.32] been a loyal Amazon customer for like 10 years buying all your physical books boom pick up a Kindle
[4276.32 → 4281.60] paperweight, and you can like to get copies of the books you've already bought on the cheap amazing now if
[4281.60 → 4287.44] they really wanted to take over the world they could offer like a trade-in program where you like to send in
[4287.44 → 4293.68] your books convert your entire library to kindle books, and then they have you as a customer for life
[4293.68 → 4298.96] because your entire library will be on kindle so if Amazon's watching I'm not as smart as you but
[4298.96 → 4305.36] sometimes i have good ideas um okay so HTC one is here i got a Verizon phone which means that
[4305.36 → 4311.52] one mini uh hopefully that means that I'm not going to have done I say one oh i got a 32 gig one yay
[4312.40 → 4318.48] i thought it was 16 gig only and i haven't actually looked at it since uh like the early rumours so
[4318.48 → 4328.16] wait what is this is a one did they send the wrong thing yeah this is a 4.7 inch 1080p okay
[4328.16 → 4334.32] well troll i don't even know why this is here true I'll take it no i should probably let them know that
[4334.32 → 4337.92] they sent the wrong thing that's what should actually happen especially since we're live
[4338.64 → 4342.88] right now it's okay finding out that the wrong thing is here i think the Verizon phone might be kind
[4342.88 → 4348.72] of glitchy as balls though because uh my wife's phone is a Verizon droid DNA and that one's like
[4348.72 → 4356.64] like still photo like photo messages because you're on bell don't work um oh i have no idea, but it's its
[4356.64 → 4362.08] uh anyway okay well scratch all that fine then we'll talk about Amazon's matchbook thing more it's great
[4363.04 → 4368.40] so you can get books this has been the so the most random conversation about anything i think we've ever
[4368.40 → 4375.92] had well okay random as in like jumping off-topic and back on topic and explaining everything in two
[4375.92 → 4380.64] sentences and then jumping back to it not random as in we end up talking about like football field
[4380.64 → 4384.64] fights with remote control that was awesome that was awesome you shouldn't, you shouldn't question the
[4384.64 → 4392.08] awesomeness of that um so anyway amazon's amazing and um yeah that's kind of it they're like
[4392.08 → 4395.84] the smartest people ever they're just going to take over the world like we should just all stop giving
[4395.84 → 4402.64] them our money if we don't want them to completely own every interesting thing is that big giant
[4402.64 → 4408.48] companies um that were super open like google is closing down every door ever as fast as they
[4408.48 → 4414.48] possibly can that's, and it's not doing look that way i shouldn't say that's true allegedly it looks that way
[4415.68 → 4423.76] and they're having some problems but then Amazon is like yeah we sell stuff so we're just going to give you
[4423.76 → 4428.64] all these options to buy things so they're opening doors, but they don't have to open the doors that
[4428.64 → 4433.04] a company like Google would have to open so it doesn't create other problems like how google wants
[4433.04 → 4438.08] to close them now so they're just opening all the doors buy anything any way you possibly can, and we'll
[4438.08 → 4442.00] take all your money, and we'll take all your money, and we don't even really care if we make money on it
[4442.00 → 4447.60] right now Amazon Prime yeah whatever we'll make money on it later no problem man just if you'll buy enough
[4447.60 → 4453.52] stuff, and then it'll work out somehow i don't know like Amazon's just crazy because they're so big and
[4453.52 → 4458.96] it just doesn't matter yeah it doesn't matter that like nothing really matters just because they're
[4458.96 → 4462.56] so ridiculously massive they can do pretty much whatever they want I've had quite a few people
[4462.56 → 4467.84] ask me about my new notebook um guys this is a xps12 from dell um I've had a lot of people ask why
[4467.84 → 4474.64] I'm using it and the straightforward answer is that acer wanted their s7 back to which i said no to which
[4474.64 → 4483.20] they said yeah, and so i sent it back and um, so intel sent me this dell which is an ultra book which
[4483.20 → 4487.92] is better than my book, and it turns into a tablet which the funny thing about it actually I'm going
[4487.92 → 4491.36] to do a video about this later because it's part of the like okay we're going to send you this notebook
[4491.36 → 4497.04] you have to like to make some kind of video about it that's the requirement just something talk about it
[4497.04 → 4502.72] I'm like okay and I'm like looking at the other people they seeded units to and I'm like these people
[4502.72 → 4509.12] have like 200 followers on Instagram like what was the process for figuring out like who's getting
[4509.12 → 4514.64] a notebook and i didn't ask that because it seemed rude but um the point is they sent me one basically
[4514.64 → 4520.72] I'm supposed to talk about it one thing i will talk about now is that i did not expect myself to use the
[4520.72 → 4525.92] floppy screen thing um but I've actually found myself using it, and it feels nice feels perfect
[4525.92 → 4532.72] sounds good um I've actually used it in tablet mode it's much too heavy to be an actual tablet
[4532.72 → 4536.96] it's more like just from a convenience standpoint I'll flip it into tablet mode if I'm like on the
[4536.96 → 4541.92] can and just you know reading a website or something like that and uh that's that's what i do with it
[4542.72 → 4550.80] so there will be a longer version of that later and somehow that'll justify sending one to me um Samsung's
[4550.80 → 4559.28] galaxy gear unveiled at their unpacked two events, so this was posted on the forum by marks Marceau
[4559.84 → 4565.76] and actually he or she did a great job of fleshing out the entire thread here so you guys should
[4565.76 → 4571.76] definitely check it out remember that we do post our document on the forum after the show so you can
[4571.76 → 4576.08] browse through all the articles that we're looking at but if you want there are a bunch of other sources
[4576.08 → 4581.92] down here at the bottom including Mashable and BBC so let's discuss that how much have you looked into
[4581.92 → 4588.08] galaxy gear so i was almost instantaneously not interested and then almost instantaneously
[4588.08 → 4593.92] interested in the Qualcomm one all right so we'll start with galaxy gear then we will talk about the
[4593.92 → 4600.08] Qualcomm talk should we bring up right away why i wasn't interested yes let's start with why okay why
[4600.08 → 4604.56] don't we start with why you weren't interested go and I'll talk about why i don't care compatibility
[4604.56 → 4609.84] issues it doesn't work with like anything it only works with Samsung stuff and even out of the
[4609.84 → 4614.40] Samsung stuff range it only works with like what two or three phones uh it works with the note 3 and
[4614.40 → 4622.96] the tab 10.1 at launch however it should be noted that Samsung has come forth and said look we know
[4623.68 → 4631.36] that's a problem it's not their usual rigmarole where they're like nope it works with only these because
[4631.36 → 4636.88] ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha uh where they do that a lot i mean even something like
[4636.88 → 4644.24] the original tab 10.1 you had to get an uh a 3g version for it to work with their all share play
[4644.24 → 4648.64] all share play i was just going to bring up all share play and I'm just like what you got a bit
[4648.64 → 4655.60] some sorry your Wi-Fi technology only works on a 3g tablet are you kidding me um so that's the
[4655.60 → 4661.28] kind of thing I'm used to seeing them do, but this is not that what they're saying is it actually has
[4661.28 → 4669.44] to do with the low power Bluetooth 4.0 implementation that enables the watch or wearable or whatever you
[4669.44 → 4674.96] want to call it i mean what do we the gear it enables the gear to communicate constantly with the
[4674.96 → 4682.64] phone in your pocket, so the gear is not a standalone device at all it's a 300 phone companion now they
[4682.64 → 4688.24] showed off a lot of really cool stuff but let's get into why i don't care at all one day battery life
[4688.24 → 4693.84] is not good enough for something i wear at all period, and you can justify it all you want but in
[4693.84 → 4698.88] much the same way that Google Glass is not ready and google understands that it's not ready and they
[4698.88 → 4703.76] just have explorer program, and they don't actually expect people to buy one as a finished product
[4703.76 → 4709.84] Samsung needs to understand that one day is not ready i don't want to go to bed and have a power
[4709.84 → 4718.00] bar worth of uh micro USB like wall chargers, so there's like your tablet your shield phone
[4718.00 → 4724.64] your phone watch um my like i might have an exercise bracelet thing that are booming right now or like
[4724.64 → 4732.16] or you know uh exercise socks that are all like also booming big deal right now like you're gonna
[4732.16 → 4739.36] okay you know what okay IKEA if you're watching next generation wardrobe okay so it's a little thing
[4739.36 → 4744.56] where basically you like hang your clothes like in much instead of hanging your clothes sideways
[4744.56 → 4750.00] it goes in the other way, and then we all standardize on where the plugs for your clothing go in and
[4750.00 → 4757.52] then one side of this cabinet is just like USB ports okay well all the hooks could be um near fields
[4757.52 → 4764.24] power charging and speaking of wireless charging gear does not wirelessly charge the Qualcomm one the
[4764.24 → 4769.20] equal okay we're talking about the Qualcomm one later the Qualcomm one's awesome i know it's so
[4769.20 → 4775.28] awesome okay so it doesn't wirelessly charge that is a dealbreaker one day battery life no wireless
[4775.28 → 4783.12] charge how can I get in the habit of using something that will just like it'll never be on and if it's a
[4783.12 → 4787.84] one day charge now what are we talking about a year from now two years from now well Samsung's gonna
[4787.84 → 4793.52] expect you i don't know buy the note 4 and the gear 2 like i don't know yeah um with that said Samsung's
[4793.52 → 4799.44] working okay and that and as a fashion accessory I'm not really sold um anon tech if you guys don't
[4799.44 → 4806.88] already know I'm a huge anon fanboy like a fanboy out pretty hard um anyway anon was basically saying
[4806.88 → 4815.52] well it's big, but it doesn't feel like you know like a watch it doesn't feel like a classy piece of
[4815.52 → 4821.44] you know fashion accessory it feels like a tiny phone on my wrist and Samsung doesn't want to
[4821.44 → 4826.64] talk about it that way, but then they go, and they build like a speaker and microphone into it so you
[4826.64 → 4831.68] can hold your wrist up to your ear, and you can talk like that I'm like why did you even make it a phone
[4832.56 → 4837.52] realistically why did you make it a phone we already have Bluetooth earpieces and Samsung's like well we
[4837.52 → 4842.64] don't want you talking to nobody like those things so we came up with this idea and I'm just like okay
[4842.64 → 4848.40] so now i can look like i don't understand that there's no phone in my hand and that'll be totally normal
[4848.40 → 4853.20] at some point, or it won't or something i don't think this will ever look i don't think that'll
[4853.20 → 4857.68] ever i don't think because like what is this and like the thing about a phone is you can put it on
[4857.68 → 4866.16] speakerphone you can switch hands you can kind of look just like dirt and stuff like yeah i know
[4866.16 → 4872.48] right okay well you know my left ear i don't hear too well on that ear but i wear watch whatever i mean
[4872.48 → 4876.64] okay we're teasing them right now but the reality of it is it's going to get better and there are some
[4876.64 → 4881.20] really, really cool things that they're doing so Samsung's whole thing with the s4 was a lot more
[4881.20 → 4886.64] gestures and a lot more motion control so one thing they showed off was okay you're previewing a text
[4886.64 → 4892.00] on your gear, and you're like oh that's important you pull your tab uh your note 3 out of your pocket
[4892.00 → 4897.84] that email or text is already on the screen because it's all like yeah I'm being taken out of the pocket
[4897.84 → 4904.48] so i can check it I'm like okay that's cool it's pretty cool gear has a camera which is 1.9 megapixel but
[4904.48 → 4908.56] who cares because megapixels are not important the quality I'm not expecting to be very great
[4908.56 → 4912.88] however it's neat that it's one swipe take a picture, and it's on your wrist at all times
[4913.84 → 4920.40] okay it has a cortex a9 which to me is sort of indicative of the sort of not specifically
[4920.40 → 4925.20] engineered processor that went into it could we have gotten two days of battery life out of it using
[4925.76 → 4931.76] a more efficient screen uh technology this is why i pulled this out is because the whole one-day battery
[4931.76 → 4937.52] life thing how long is that actually going to be one day this phone now consistently over the last
[4937.52 → 4946.24] few days s3 100 at 9 30 in the morning 10 at 4 pm right I'm using it quite a bit right now like a lot but
[4948.16 → 4954.32] still yeah what the heck yeah that will not last me close to a full day that won't last me a full work
[4954.32 → 4962.64] day let alone a full day so yeah i mean uh okay hold on let's let's keep going let's keep going when
[4962.64 → 4968.16] i tuned in the on the unveiling had about a hundred thousand views so i mean there's that's not as many
[4968.16 → 4972.24] as i expected, but it shows that there's a lot of interest still, but there 's's also a lot of
[4972.24 → 4976.32] interest because not necessarily because people are going to buy it, and they were unveiling note 3 as
[4976.32 → 4986.08] well okay next gen tab 10.1 okay anyway um okay heavily gesture dependent interface obvious uses okay
[4986.08 → 4990.96] why what why am I'm going to buy a wearable actually i pre-ordered a pebble so i don't know when it's
[4990.96 → 4996.88] going to ship but i ordered a pebble uh why a wearable um well for me the biggest thing is i get a ton of
[4996.88 → 5004.08] emails and texts so if i can be like is this important yes or no it'll save my wife from yelling at me
[5004.08 → 5008.88] about constantly having my phone out if i can check if something matters before i actually have
[5008.88 → 5016.40] to commit to using a bigger screen do i think that i am at any point going to use my wrist to
[5016.40 → 5021.60] talk to reply to a text message I'm not much of a voice control guy maybe my son will be all about
[5021.60 → 5026.72] the voice control because it'll be a completely different paradigm whereas for me, it I'm probably
[5026.72 → 5032.32] still faster if i pop the phone out of my pocket if it's intelligent enough to go you know bloop load that
[5032.32 → 5036.08] up on my phone and i can be typing as soon as i get it out of my pocket that's still going to be more
[5036.08 → 5041.60] efficient for me um but i will get it wearable just so that i can preview things because that's awesome
[5042.80 → 5047.84] um Samsung expects there to be a lot of development of additional apps they're expecting to open up
[5047.84 → 5051.52] compatibility to others of their phones as well as third-party phones they were talking about that
[5051.52 → 5057.52] already which is a huge step forward again for their attitude which at times in the past i haven't
[5057.52 → 5063.68] really liked which is if you don't own the matching generation of Samsung ecosystem the latest TV the
[5063.68 → 5070.96] latest uh phone watch you know uh butt plug whatever it is that they have like can't all share play with
[5070.96 → 5075.52] your butt plug if you don't have all the other things i don't know that i would share a butt plug
[5075.52 → 5085.20] anyway, but you could play with it anyway um let's move on to the yes to Qualcomm's entry into
[5085.20 → 5090.40] the smartwatch game i was expecting you to go somewhere else no, no i think we had gone quite
[5090.40 → 5096.96] far enough the oculus one oculus butt plug no oh, oh that game no, no no we'll do this first because
[5096.96 → 5102.64] we've been talking about smartwatches quite a bit here, so guns cool posted on the forum great job he's
[5102.64 → 5108.72] got uh two articles this week the focus today may be at the galaxy gear but none other than Qualcomm is
[5108.72 → 5113.04] entering the smart smartwatch market with a device they're calling the talk so they're targeting the
[5113.04 → 5120.16] same price point which is around 300 so there you go guys a smartwatch is it's been decided by the
[5120.16 → 5126.16] powers that be 300 bucks they cost 300 so there you go um so they're going to be using a different
[5126.16 → 5130.72] display technology so their Marisol low energy display tech they're claiming is going to help
[5130.72 → 5138.48] deliver three to five days per charge boom owned uh there is going to be no platform dependency
[5138.48 → 5144.48] so text reminders uh music control this is something that I'd talk to you about awesome
[5144.48 → 5148.56] it's like i was thinking you know what someone should have built two or three years ago is just
[5148.56 → 5154.88] like a little Bluetooth thing with like Velcro on the back that you can like stick to your dash in
[5154.88 → 5161.12] your car or like somewhere so that you can use it to control the output of your phone just control your
[5161.12 → 5167.04] music player basically like um an Apple TV remote except like smaller and Bluetooth because you're
[5167.04 → 5170.72] not allowed whipping out your phone yes driving, but you're allowed to change the song and like on
[5170.72 → 5175.76] my motorbike i have speakers in my helmet so that i can use my GPS or i can listen to music while I'm
[5175.76 → 5180.96] riding but still hear what's going on around me so if i just had a little like thing that i could stick
[5180.96 → 5185.68] to the front of my bike or whatever obviously i can't reach into my phone to skip a track and because
[5185.68 → 5191.44] the uh the standards for like one button navigation are such a cluster hump whether you're using an
[5191.44 → 5195.52] iOS or android device or whatever else that's not feasible, so something like that would have been
[5195.52 → 5201.52] great boom smartwatch so i can just be like you know bloop or whatever when I'm at a traffic light so
[5201.52 → 5207.28] cool love it yeah um likely won't have the same amazing integration that gears offering like whipping
[5207.28 → 5211.68] out your phone and having it already looking at the email you were previewing which is amazing and cool
[5211.68 → 5219.36] but after okay so but yeah it's going to be limited edition, and it has wireless charging cool it's
[5219.36 → 5227.60] like okay another furniture idea IKEA i hope you're watching okay bedside table nightstand wireless
[5227.60 → 5234.08] charging surface on the whole top of it on the whole top boom billion-dollar idea you know how they sell
[5234.08 → 5240.08] those like you, you buy the table, but then you can buy the glass top yes just have it so you buy the table
[5240.08 → 5244.72] and you can buy the like wireless charging top because that's IKEA's whole thing is like yes you
[5244.72 → 5252.16] can get the small length table with the like you know top like i don't know i can't make fun of
[5252.16 → 5257.52] Swedish i don't even know enough Swedish to tease Swedish people but like oh man that's going to be
[5257.52 → 5263.60] amazing so you get home you know you strip down you take off your watch your phone your keys i mean
[5263.60 → 5268.08] by that time your keys will probably be battery powered so you can just wave them in front of your door
[5268.08 → 5274.56] and be like i shall pass you can yeah well there you go so all that stuff can just recharge itself
[5274.56 → 5280.32] i mean even things like car fobs for unlocking your car all of a sudden they could be way more advanced
[5280.32 → 5283.84] because everyone would go home drop them on their bedside table, and they could charge so they could
[5283.84 → 5288.40] work from like three kilometres away and be like high-powered you know bloop I'm over here
[5289.04 → 5295.52] come get me come get me they have that smartphone this is a slightly off-topic but i don't remember who it
[5295.52 → 5300.32] is i think it's ford has a smartphone app for i think one of their cars now one of their consumer
[5300.32 → 5304.56] grade cars where you can lock it from wherever that's awesome you can lock it unlock it do whatever
[5304.56 → 5307.76] from wherever so if you walk away from your car, and you're like oh crap that i forget to lock it
[5307.76 → 5313.76] and just press the lock button and be like car locked yep i vote for that all right so uh i think that
[5313.76 → 5319.44] pretty much covers so that limited edition so i have no idea what that means exactly i guess what
[5319.44 → 5324.96] they're like limited to 50 500 000 units or something, or maybe it's limited maybe it's
[5324.96 → 5330.16] like a reference design that they're just like to dogs hey make some of these things so we can sell
[5330.16 → 5335.04] you our chips and put them in it, we don't actually want to be a smart watchmaker we just want to
[5335.04 → 5340.96] build all the chips that go in all of them guys go get on this because you're sitting around waiting
[5340.96 → 5346.08] for Samsung to release gear apple to release I'm extremely excited about i watch i actually haven't
[5346.08 → 5351.60] been excited about an apple thing in a while but if their integration is tighter and better than
[5351.60 → 5356.80] what Samsung can do which in the better too which in the past is like oh and apple's so good at the
[5356.80 → 5362.96] premium feel oh exactly it'll look better it'll feel better if they nail it i might go back to iOS
[5362.96 → 5371.12] really yeah yeah yeah because it probably wouldn't really integrate with other things yeah so let's see
[5371.12 → 5375.68] things are going to be heating up this is expected to be like an umpteen billion-dollar industry by like
[5375.68 → 5380.16] 2016 or something like that so until they can completely get rid of them yeah whatever the
[5380.16 → 5384.72] heck that it is very exciting so let's go back to Linus's screen submitted by nick trance on the
[5384.72 → 5393.04] forum this is Nokia's uh latest sort of shot at Google so apparently they're Samsung uh did I say
[5393.68 → 5402.40] well no google oh well both i guess mainly Samsung, but it could be googled have a break have a know
[5402.40 → 5408.08] well okay, okay how about you and i can debate who we think this is a shot at the point is uh they took
[5408.08 → 5414.00] to twitter to uh put out this little have a break have a broken in half phone in much the same sort
[5414.00 → 5418.80] of style as the old KitKat ads have a break have a give me a break give me a break me off the
[5418.80 → 5422.64] piece of that KitKat bar and then there's another thing here this is actually i think this one's
[5422.64 → 5428.32] actually hilarious um so I'm going to go ahead and zoom in for you guys check this out uh, so this is a
[5428.32 → 5434.80] Samsung Galaxy camera uh or galaxy s4 rather whatever it is Samsung Galaxy whatever the only
[5434.80 → 5440.40] smartphone with 10 times optical zoom yeah whatever this thing is uh still it didn't see this coming
[5440.40 → 5447.04] so they've got the Lucia 1020 with its 41 megapixel camera over there kind of going like oh yeah you
[5447.04 → 5454.24] know what's up what's up come at me bro um so okay I'll give your take on it first okay they're going
[5454.24 → 5461.60] after Samsung because there's a Samsung phone snapped in half okay, and they're a phone manufacturer
[5461.60 → 5466.96] okay, and they're showing another company's phone snapped in half okay you probably could snap a s4
[5466.96 → 5471.68] in half like that you probably could right so that's kind of a thing yeah don't try you can probably snap
[5471.68 → 5477.36] a s3 and a half like that as wells please don't try um just flex okay I'm I'm calling it I'm calling it
[5477.36 → 5481.36] a shot at Google i think they're doing a shot at both because there's like yeah like i don't think it's
[5481.36 → 5484.32] about i don't think it's about the device at all i think they just picked the most popular one
[5484.88 → 5488.88] and we're just like you know what well i mean because they're kind of both they're kind of
[5488.88 → 5493.76] software and hardware now after the acquisition so okay i thought that was going to be more of
[5493.76 → 5499.44] an argument than it ended up being well they're obviously going after both i just think considering
[5499.44 → 5504.64] Samsung's branding it's like right there quite specifically on it and like almost the whole photo
[5504.64 → 5509.36] is a broken in half device they could have blurred it yeah, and they did they decided not at all
[5509.36 → 5515.44] so that's why i was like wow that's pretty anti-Samsung, but it's definitely both good
[5515.44 → 5524.00] bites posts on the forum Surface Pro 2 is a go so the main highlights of Surface Pro 2 are Haswell
[5524.00 → 5530.00] processor so if you guys were tuned in when we had tiny tom on earlier Haswell definitely does
[5530.00 → 5534.32] improve at least one thing and that is power consumption unless you're overclocking
[5534.32 → 5542.08] um and heat output so Surface Pro 2 is this the magic is this the magic bullet i back when we
[5542.08 → 5546.72] were talking about surface a lot back when it first came out we both said that we were waiting for more
[5546.72 → 5551.68] high revisions I've liked the surface idea i think more than you because i like the idea of being
[5551.68 → 5558.16] able to have my desktop apps' no i really liked it for me the whole thing was a tablet with a keyboard and
[5558.16 → 5565.76] office because yeah i like the Surface Pro idea more than surface RT okay yes um and the problem
[5565.76 → 5570.40] my only problem with Surface Pro was that it was heavy and bulky and it was basically an Ultrabook
[5570.40 → 5576.16] i mean by the time you could buy yourself an Aspire s7 which was just as thin remember the s7 11 inch
[5576.16 → 5581.04] first gen yeah that's a good point yeah why do i want a surface this has an actual keyboard on it versus
[5581.04 → 5586.88] touch cover and type cover both of which were usable, but they weren't great experiences i really didn't
[5586.88 → 5593.92] like touch cover at all and type cover was not great but at all i preferred touch cover
[5593.92 → 5599.28] just because it was like there's no feedback at all but again if i was going type cover I'd go for
[5599.28 → 5605.76] something way better yeah yep so anyway okay we both agreed that surface wasn't there yet um and surface RT
[5605.76 → 5612.16] i still think is just a total disaster because for me the point is being able to run office and being
[5612.16 → 5616.56] able to install whatever i want and i think at the time you were worried about development tools yeah running
[5616.56 → 5624.24] on it yeah like it's got to be x86 or forget it yeah um so I'm still excited about Surface Pro 2 so
[5624.24 → 5629.60] it has well it's got eight gigs of ram now it has a new multi-position kickstand so the original kickstand
[5629.60 → 5633.92] was like here or here, and it had a very satisfying click and that was great, but now it's going to have
[5633.92 → 5640.24] more position so you can put it at more angles and there's also going to be a RT two angles one
[5640.24 → 5645.20] that'll like to mimic a kind of laptop style so it'll feel like you're using a laptop and another one that's
[5645.20 → 5652.88] better used for uneven surfaces so um it's going to have seven-hour battery life which is way better
[5653.44 → 5658.96] like way better that was the other problem with surface pros like who cares because it's irrelevant
[5658.96 → 5664.24] because it lasts for like three hours on battery so with all of that said my iPad sits in a corner
[5664.80 → 5671.12] and i don't use it um I've switched completely to the s7 when i was actually using my iPad a lot
[5671.12 → 5679.28] before i got it and then after the s7 was ripped from your yeah cold dying hands clutch not dead but
[5679.28 → 5685.04] grasped from anyway uh when that was torn away from me, i have switched to using this completely if i need
[5685.04 → 5691.60] a tablet i use this i don't use my iPad um first Surface Pro 2 is extremely appealing to me because
[5691.60 → 5698.16] it's even more tablet-y but better power consumption yeah and more way more flexibility than something like
[5698.16 → 5703.20] an iPad I'm interested to see what iOS 7 does for iPad i mean apple has an event coming up in i think
[5703.20 → 5710.56] four days when they're expected to unveil cheapo iPhone iOS 7 and a bunch of junk so um expect
[5710.56 → 5715.84] me to be on Twitter like you know hardcore ripping on everything they're actually i don't know i might
[5715.84 → 5721.60] like it depends yeah depends what it is yeah we'll see i yeah I'm still not sold on tablets I'm I'm more
[5721.60 → 5727.12] excited about that one but i just still want a real keyboard and a real touchpad and would you would
[5727.12 → 5732.48] okay now having used that vision notebook that we have would you buy a notebook that doesn't have a
[5732.48 → 5738.24] touchscreen anymore i never used it you never used the touchscreen i don't care oh all right forget it
[5738.24 → 5743.28] right you were you had a mouse and keyboard plugged into it okay that makes a difference um both Etzel and
[5743.28 → 5749.04] i are pretty sold on touchscreen like i use touchscreen a lot on my notebook it's cool and if i was in
[5749.04 → 5754.88] school i think i would use it a lot more right but when i was just typing a lot and the keyboard
[5754.88 → 5760.24] and that thing sucks so i put in another keyboard meaning I'm even further away from the screen
[5760.24 → 5766.32] right so it touched the screen I'm like all the time so it's not that usable all right so speaking
[5766.32 → 5772.96] of things that are not that usable if you are an average person who is not particularly uh talented
[5772.96 → 5777.92] when it comes to you know making websites and whatever else and again i apologize our lower third
[5777.92 → 5783.12] is kind of incorrect down there and uh i am very, very sorry about that Etzel's supposed to
[5783.12 → 5788.88] send me a corrected one so uh squarespace.com slash Linus for a free trial and of course you can
[5788.88 → 5796.80] use offer code linus9 to get 20 off on new accounts so what Squarespace does is they sponsor the wan show
[5796.80 → 5803.60] which we are very, very thankful for, and they also allow you to easily and quickly create your own webs
[5803.60 → 5811.20] but web webspace so it's like I've completely taken over my mind um anyway they allow you
[5811.20 → 5817.44] to easily and quickly create your own website which you can customize to no small degree so they
[5817.44 → 5822.32] actually corrected me on something i said last week was I think i said that the advanced mode where you
[5822.32 → 5828.00] can dive right into the CSS and all the all the back end stuff i had said it was somewhat limited
[5828.00 → 5831.92] apparently it's really not that limited, and you can kind of tinker with it however you want
[5831.92 → 5840.40] um so we actually created the updated Linus media group.com website using Squarespace it was way
[5840.96 → 5845.92] simpler than using WordPress which is what we were using before so you can actually browse on there it's
[5845.92 → 5850.56] fully functional, and you can make changes on the fly uh Etzel was able to do it did he need any help
[5850.56 → 5857.76] from you uh i had no not really not creating the website and design and everything he did that all on his
[5857.76 → 5862.72] one yeah okay so uh basically you can check out sort of our roster you can get in touch with us
[5862.72 → 5866.72] although i don't actually know that we monitor that you can see our shows one of which you're
[5866.72 → 5870.96] actually watching right now so the whole idea behind Squarespace is it's supposed to take that
[5870.96 → 5876.80] whole concept of like a template for making your own website and make it end up looking beautiful by the
[5876.80 → 5881.12] time you're done with it even if you don't really know anything about it so it'll work at various
[5881.12 → 5887.20] resolutions whether it's on the desktop or a laptop or a tablet or even a smartphone without you really
[5887.20 → 5892.32] having to intervene in any way they've got a lot of back-end stuff that you can play around with
[5892.32 → 5897.04] such as being able to take payments very easily if you wanted to build a small web store uh whether
[5897.04 → 5903.68] it's to sell your own stuff or whether it's like unbox therapy actually i think uh i think he's doing
[5903.68 → 5908.40] a Squarespace thing right now as well so Lou from unbox therapy who was a guest a little while ago yeah
[5908.40 → 5912.72] there you go so we can check out Lou's website where he's got a few different things so here's
[5912.72 → 5919.52] his trusted gear which i think links to his Amazon affiliate link and um so the idea is being able
[5919.52 → 5924.08] to make something that looks like a real website and is accessible to everyone very quickly very easily
[5924.08 → 5927.92] it starts at i think it's like eight dollars a month or something like that so it's not terribly
[5927.92 → 5932.72] expensive especially considering that it includes the hosting as well and of course if you use
[5933.28 → 5941.12] that offer code linus9 then you can get 20 off for the month of September on your first purchase
[5941.12 → 5947.36] so squarespace.com offer code linus9 guys do check it out we do recommend it, and we are actually
[5947.36 → 5951.92] switching over to a paid subscription with them because I'll feel better about recommending it to
[5951.92 → 5957.52] you all if we're actually paying for it and yeah it's definitely saved us time and hassle
[5957.52 → 5962.64] because if you guys ever did check out the linusmediagroup.com website you might have noticed it was down all the
[5962.64 → 5967.92] time because we were just hosting it out of a server that was over at NCI in some room that apparently doesn't need
[5967.92 → 5974.16] power and the motherboard and networking and like oh man and the motherboard to be on and the
[5974.16 → 5980.80] motherboard doesn't boot anymore, and anyway the old way is dead so long live this new way of
[5980.80 → 5989.52] doing good riddance old way good riddance old way stupid setup oh god uh speaking of the old way
[5989.52 → 5997.60] oh this is interesting google's Trojan horse how chrome apps will finally take on windows
[5997.60 → 6002.72] so this was an article from the verge who i love um go to the verge every day, and then you won't
[6002.72 → 6007.36] even have to watch the wan show because stop saying that last time you said you wanted to go to the
[6007.36 → 6012.80] forum this time you said you want to go to what are you trying to do why don't you just go work for them
[6012.80 → 6022.08] no because we're more fun there that's why you should tune into the wan show every week
[6022.72 → 6032.00] because the verge wouldn't talk about USB butt plugs um so google is introducing an all-new chrome
[6032.00 → 6039.20] app experience where the idea is that real computer applications that are just meant to be run on your
[6039.20 → 6046.32] computer not even inside a Chrome browser would be coded in the same way as a chrome app
[6047.44 → 6053.84] so think about that for a second this will do two things number one is the hope is that it will allow
[6053.84 → 6062.08] developers to develop using their ecosystem so they'll be able to presumably easily and in such a
[6062.08 → 6066.32] way that it is pleasing for both them and their end users create these applications and number two
[6066.32 → 6071.60] and they'll, they'll run on you know anything that can run a Chrome browser so it'll make the OS not
[6071.60 → 6080.96] matter which would then make chrome os matter a lot more a thing and make it so that google can
[6080.96 → 6087.68] control every application ever created they really are just going to take over the world aren't they
[6087.68 → 6095.84] you're going to try it's like that whole thing from this was bigger a few years back actually but the
[6095.84 → 6100.08] people were like oh what is the closest thing to god because god is all-knowing they're like google
[6100.08 → 6103.12] because you can search whatever you want it's supposed to be a big joke thing whatever right
[6103.12 → 6108.96] they're like they're trying to control literally the whole planet they're actually trying to be that
[6109.92 → 6114.72] it's getting kind of nuts and as they're doing it they're closing more doors which is scary to me
[6114.72 → 6122.64] personally yeah so i mean uh you know what guys hit me twitter blitz so you can talk about chrome OS
[6122.64 → 6128.16] and chrome apps and give your thoughts about this, or you can just ask a general q a question we are
[6128.16 → 6132.80] going to do a twitter blitz uh very soon here so we're going to move on but let's do two more topics
[6132.80 → 6140.08] and then uh let's let's move on to that so Galaxy Note 3 moves to an USB 3.0 micro connector this was
[6140.08 → 6145.20] submitted on the forum by that one kid and uh slicks giving it the thumbs up I'm giving it the
[6145.20 → 6151.28] big thumbs down why big thumbs down okay you wanted something else oh i wanted something else but are you
[6151.28 → 6156.72] still happy that they're at least moving no because in my experience so anyway this uh original
[6156.72 → 6164.00] compatible original article was from VR zone i don't care okay so here's the problem is that USB 3 micro
[6164.00 → 6170.32] is actually just more pins in that fantastic connector yep that's all it is seems to secure
[6170.32 → 6174.96] better in my experience in my experience I've broken the only one that I've had so far oh really
[6174.96 → 6181.76] so and my other experience is talking to angel bird about their external SSDs and how even with the
[6181.76 → 6188.48] highest end micro USB connector they were getting like 250 plugs out of it so now let's
[6188.48 → 6192.24] talk about your one-day battery wait wait wait I've been wondering about that for a while because
[6192.24 → 6196.96] you keep on bringing up the angel bird data yes, but we don't have one we don't have the angel bird
[6196.96 → 6202.16] data that's true but what i do have is my broken connector i have done way more than 250 plugs on
[6202.16 → 6207.12] the same cable with micro USB and never had a problem okay so i would really like this angel bird
[6207.12 → 6212.08] data to be in print before we keep on saying it every single time we ever find okay fine okay let's say
[6212.08 → 6219.92] double that because okay fine how about this lets do this okay my wife's phone galaxy one whatever that
[6219.92 → 6228.64] was called galaxy vibrant um broke within two years micro USB connector unusable didn't particularly
[6228.64 → 6236.64] abuse it plugged it in once a day um okay that thing over there whatever that is that usb3 hub okay
[6236.64 → 6241.36] okay that one survived about 10 connections so that's an usb3 micro thing was pretty sure
[6241.36 → 6248.64] hold on um i also have an external hard drive one of those go flex uh connectors that go in the
[6248.64 → 6254.96] back that one's dead that one survived about 30 plugs um but that one you jammed into your bag
[6255.52 → 6262.08] that's no not that one okay it's a different dead one uh so my experience so far with usb3 micro is
[6262.08 → 6266.00] not any better than usb2 micro i don't have much experience with it just it felt more solid and i
[6266.00 → 6272.16] think we can both agree that usb2 micro is a big steaming pile it's terrible so here's something i want
[6272.16 → 6280.48] to know why were they not working on a locking connector and speaking of which so usb3 micro okay
[6280.48 → 6287.60] I'm done with that topic for now speaking of which HDMI why have they not been working on a locking
[6287.60 → 6297.04] connector unpreaching believable i mean we've had locking connectors since what serial yeah like i mean how
[6297.04 → 6303.04] far back do we have to go until we find when people hadn't yet figured out that putting a screw
[6303.04 → 6309.76] or a lock or something in place was a good idea so I'm excited about the other advances but i do when i
[6309.76 → 6315.44] when i realized there were no changes in like the style i was pretty disappointed, and you know what
[6315.44 → 6322.08] i don't I don't see um i don't see interoperability as an excuse because there's no reason why they
[6322.08 → 6327.44] couldn't have expanded the standard to have an optional lock oh definitely so they could have had
[6327.44 → 6334.16] lockable devices and non-lockable devices you could have just gone the way uh the display port does
[6334.16 → 6339.12] it yes it's so simple it's so simple, or they even could have had like a weird thing that goes
[6339.12 → 6345.68] off to the side for all i care and then on the back of larger devices like TVs or cameras or things
[6345.68 → 6350.72] where it's likely to be a problem on the back of a video card there could be that optional thing and
[6350.72 → 6356.16] then you'd still maintain backwards compatibility with the older cables unbelievable to me because
[6356.16 → 6362.96] HDMI is a terrible connector mini HDMI is an even worse connector and micro HDMI is slightly not as
[6362.96 → 6369.52] bad as mini HDMI but definitely worse than full-size HDMI and i hate them all, and they can all just
[6369.52 → 6375.20] die in a fire Linus rage at cables tips yeah I'm like I'm so mad I'm like I'm just so i don't care as
[6375.20 → 6379.84] much about the phone because you can still use the old cable so either nothing changed or you can use one
[6379.84 → 6384.40] more cable but i would have liked to see them change styles completely that would have been a
[6384.40 → 6388.64] lot better i mean i think wireless charging is going to make this a non-issue very soon particularly
[6388.64 → 6393.84] on the phone side quite soon um so I'm I'm ready to get over that but i mean look at how long we were
[6393.84 → 6399.20] stuck with HDMI 1.x so that means we're going to be stuck with this stupid non-locking connector
[6399.20 → 6404.56] everyone's going to use it because it's HDMI yeah that's basically um good enough for today
[6404.56 → 6410.64] and nothing more than that because we already have 4k TVs it's not like it's not like they're
[6410.64 → 6418.16] building in headroom DisplayPort three years ago had support for 17.28 gigabit per second data rates
[6418.72 → 6426.32] had an auxiliary channel had audio channel this had all that stuff and HDMI is like catching up
[6426.32 → 6434.56] where's my future display interface do you want to revise to 2.1 and sell me a new cable do you want
[6434.56 → 6441.44] to do this do you want to do that one a two one b come on guys you had three years to be like oh
[6441.44 → 6446.64] someone has um a different standard that like might be better so it's HDMI it's cheap as poop
[6447.92 → 6452.64] no DisplayPort's cheaper to implement than HDMI what DisplayPort is royalty-free
[6452.64 → 6460.32] HDMI costs money per like what have they been doing with all the money that's a good point
[6460.32 → 6465.76] i forgot about that so anyway it's an 18 gigabit per second data rate which is i mean it's relevant
[6465.76 → 6469.52] but it's not the be-all and end-all because the standards that go behind it are actually more
[6469.52 → 6474.64] important in some ways you can buy the cables for HDMI cheaper than DisplayPort can you not uh no i don't
[6474.64 → 6480.40] think so only because they're more common yeah they don't actually cost any more or less to make no but
[6480.40 → 6484.00] you can buy them you can get DPS pretty cheap now head over to like mono price or whatever yeah
[6484.00 → 6490.48] they're cheap because they were not cheap when i was looking no uh okay so 18 gigabits per second 60 fps
[6490.48 → 6496.96] 4k so I'm looking at that going really that's my future display standard where's my 120 fps 4k
[6497.52 → 6504.40] where's my 3d 4k with like full non-compressed frames because the next revision there will be
[6504.40 → 6508.72] another revision you know it so they're going to be so there will be like some stupid frame packing
[6508.72 → 6514.16] thing or something stupid like that point 2b whatever okay so i mean get this i mean okay
[6514.16 → 6520.08] so maybe you don't care about 3d what if you care about uh screen sharing in multiplayer games what
[6520.08 → 6525.12] if you want to play a two-player game where you actually use polarized glasses to each see a different
[6525.12 → 6530.16] image, and you don't want to play at 30 fps what about that what if you want to actually have what
[6530.16 → 6536.72] we've been taking for granted on the pc for what 10 years 15 years i don't even know how far back you
[6536.72 → 6543.04] have to go to find a display that doesn't run at least 60 hertz um so console gamers i
[6543.04 → 6548.16] mean aside from the fact that none of their next-gen consoles are going to run at 4k anyway um they're
[6548.16 → 6552.48] going to be stuck in the dark ages like now, and then they're going to be stuck in the dark ages when
[6552.48 → 6557.76] even when they get a console uh refresh because HDMI which is what all these consoles are going to use
[6557.76 → 6563.44] for output is not even going to support the frame rates that they would need to i mean to output to
[6563.44 → 6568.48] multiple i mean what if they had actually had the bandwidth available to work into a HDMI one
[6568.48 → 6573.28] point what are two point whatever so you could run multiple displays on a console like all
[6573.28 → 6578.08] these things that they could have done i know this is just going to sound like you know an uneducated
[6578.08 → 6585.20] rant but why not why couldn't they have done this HDMI is just so accepted how many if you go
[6585.20 → 6591.36] randomly out on the street, and you go hey do you know what a HDMI cable is i know everyone
[6591.36 → 6595.84] will say yes i wasn't even expecting to be this mad about this on the LAN show today but like
[6596.88 → 6602.88] I'm just this mad um so it supports 32 channel sound, so the idea is that i guess if you were
[6602.88 → 6609.60] watching content at 1080p or playing content at 1080p um 60 fps 4k would be about equivalent to
[6610.40 → 6618.40] four separate streams at 60 fps 1080p so if you wanted to have like multiple people you know playing a
[6618.40 → 6624.32] racing game all on the same screen if we can get like 240 hertz screens and like crazy stuff going
[6624.32 → 6630.00] on um it supports 32 channels of sound, so everyone can have their own sound channels um i mean that
[6630.00 → 6635.52] whole thing is both cool and scary to me because the idea of everyone sitting around the TV and that
[6635.52 → 6640.48] being considered family time is scary enough the idea of everyone sitting around the TV watching a
[6640.48 → 6645.84] completely different program even listening to different audio yeah like little johnny is like playing as
[6645.84 → 6654.96] Wii U and like little sally is browsing uh the smart TV or like using a Chromecast to like play games on mylittlepony.com
[6655.52 → 6662.40] and dad's watching you know grind house and mom's watching i don't know whatever some show that women
[6662.40 → 6667.92] watch that is good i don't know like I'm generalizing here none of these generalizations are necessarily the
[6667.92 → 6675.12] case i mean dad could be on mylittlepony.com we know this is a thing so there you go um that is even
[6675.12 → 6679.76] scarier to me than any of this other stuff so dual video streams for multiple users so apparently not
[6679.76 → 6686.88] four video streams but again bandwidth wise why couldn't they have done it yeah and uh multi-stream
[6686.88 → 6693.20] audio as many as four users at once support for 21 by 9 widescreen displays i don't care about that on
[6693.20 → 6698.32] the desktop i don't care about that but i think i might care about that for a TV really yeah because
[6698.32 → 6703.52] movies are actually shot that way whereas like games like they look all weird in fisheye when you do that
[6703.52 → 6708.00] yeah, but it's gonna look so weird anyway because it's like you watched at the movie theatre yeah
[6708.00 → 6712.08] and you sit way the freak back well yeah but if you're sitting far enough away, and you have like
[6712.08 → 6716.64] a nice big display what are you going to like cut holes to your whole house well I'm not going to buy one
[6716.64 → 6720.64] no you're not which is why it doesn't matter you don't actually care yeah but i don't buy anything
[6720.64 → 6725.36] what's the last thing i bought, but you get given it, and you won't be given one of these okay i don't
[6725.36 → 6732.16] get any i don't get any sample TVs for those you get screens sometimes not very often we have a few
[6732.16 → 6736.56] screens we do have a few we do have a few monitors, but we haven't okay anyway um
[6738.88 → 6743.04] i think that's pretty much all i have to say about that as Forrest Gump would say we're actually
[6743.04 → 6748.08] up to two hours right now so we're going to do that twitter blitz and uh i have some forum announcements
[6748.08 → 6752.32] that we like he's going to do the forum thing, and then we're going to call that a night we've actually got
[6752.32 → 6757.68] a lot more topics we could oh no first let's make sure we didn't miss any of our call-out topics
[6757.68 → 6762.80] so I've Bradwell Microsoft galaxy gear okay we're good yeah all the topics we promised to
[6762.80 → 6767.12] cover you know what let's do a quick blitz of things, so blackberry is going to be sold by November
[6767.12 → 6772.48] um okay whoever didn't see this one coming Sony's going to release a VR headset, but it apparently is
[6772.48 → 6779.52] like not very comfortable and not that great okay but read the article it's on the verge
[6779.52 → 6784.88] it'll be it'll be on it'll be on the uh wan dot which will be in the Linus news and rambling
[6784.88 → 6789.92] section of the forum later tonight uh soccer oh actually okay i do want to talk about this so
[6789.92 → 6798.48] this is an article from cbc.ca which is um like Canada's you know news thing that we have um so to
[6798.48 → 6805.60] ensure to ensure every child wins the Ontario athletic association removes the ball from soccer
[6805.60 → 6809.28] and I'm actually just going to read the whole article because it's awesome with the growing
[6809.28 → 6813.60] concern over the effects of competition in youth sports programs this summer many Canadian
[6813.60 → 6819.60] soccer associations eliminated the concept of keeping score this is a thing this is real okay
[6820.24 → 6824.64] the soccer association of mid-lake Ontario however has taken this idea one step further and have
[6824.64 → 6830.00] completely removed the ball from all youth soccer games and practices according to association
[6830.00 → 6835.36] spokesperson Helen Abbey coil by removing the ball it's absolutely impossible to say this team won and
[6835.36 → 6839.68] this team lost, or this child is better at soccer than that child we want our children to grow up
[6839.68 → 6844.00] in learning that sport is not about competition rather it's about using your imagination if you
[6844.00 → 6849.68] imagine you're good at soccer then you are this summer peter old ring spent time with the mid-lake
[6849.68 → 6856.32] thunder cats and under 11 boys and girls team and put together this radio documentary okay so
[6857.68 → 6864.16] it's a joke, but the scary thing is that it's really believable is that you weren't sure for a while yeah
[6864.16 → 6870.96] because i remember this i was like wait this is CBC the whole not keeping score thing is a real thing
[6870.96 → 6875.76] which is ridiculous because by the time you're 10 you know how to count, and it's not like the kids
[6875.76 → 6881.76] aren't keeping track even when i was a kid like this existed oh me too to a certain extent and like
[6881.76 → 6886.56] you know you after the game my dad would be like who won I'd be like we won it was seven to five
[6886.56 → 6892.24] and the coach would be like oh we don't keep score I'm like well i was keeping score yeah i got a goal
[6892.24 → 6896.32] we'd even have games what would happen a lot too is if you started winning by too much or if you
[6896.32 → 6901.12] started losing by too much whatever they would stop keeping score but then all the kids knew anyway yes
[6901.12 → 6905.36] and all the parents knew anyway everyone knew so it doesn't matter everyone knew it doesn't actually
[6905.36 → 6911.20] help so we found out that Microsoft uh didn't want heavy rain which is winning a ton of awards and
[6911.20 → 6916.88] going to be a super exciting PS4 exclusive because of the child abduction plot line um i mean to me
[6916.88 → 6923.60] this is kind of an extreme case of keeping um sort of inappropriate content off of a console because
[6923.60 → 6929.68] it's not like Microsoft is going to get judged for what a game developer releases by sort of you
[6929.68 → 6934.88] know people who aren't ridiculous um it's happened though it's happened but like we're not talking about
[6934.88 → 6940.72] those like straight pornographic games that existed for early consoles like the Japanese uh
[6941.68 → 6945.60] trail rape or whatever it's called whatever that was called like there was stuff that was
[6945.60 → 6952.24] that was like bad and one of Nintendo's big things was family friendly uh family friendly AMISOM
[6952.88 → 6957.04] okay, so this is good for all ages and they tightly controlled who could release games on their
[6957.04 → 6962.32] platform but to me this is like i mean that child abduction is a real thing whereas like walking around
[6962.32 → 6967.84] in the desert with like a ginormous erection like shooting at things is not um so i wonder how many
[6967.84 → 6972.24] people are going to get that reference yeah i don't it's a pretty old reference it's a thing
[6972.24 → 6976.64] though that's it that is an actual reference I'm not making this up no he's not um i i i
[6976.64 → 6982.00] completely agree with you although i do also understand where they were coming from i think they
[6982.00 → 6986.08] should have gone the angle that you went which is where it's not that out there and if you put a
[6986.08 → 6990.96] high enough rating on if it's fine yeah i don't it should have been fine, and now they're just giving
[6990.96 → 6999.92] away sales to PlayStation 4. um okay so twitter blitz time boom boom here we go 163 interactions
[6999.92 → 7004.80] i love you guys thank you for tuning in you guys are awesome i feel like lots of tech companies have
[7004.80 → 7008.64] given up on innovation because they know people will buy it anyway you know what that's oh I'm not
[7008.64 → 7012.32] i don't care i don't want to get too far into this, but this is one of the things that i really dislike
[7012.32 → 7017.36] about some companies Samsung comes to mind where it's like it doesn't seem to matter if the new
[7017.36 → 7022.56] features on their new product like do anything or work because people just buy it anyway one thing
[7022.56 → 7028.00] i don't even care because there will always be that one group that's pushing really hard self-driving
[7028.00 → 7033.04] cars there are certain companies that have switched to 30 self-driving vehicles already wow there's some
[7033.04 → 7038.96] like mining company 30 of their trucks are all self-driving and like there 's's Oculus Rift and
[7038.96 → 7044.32] like there is a lot of innovation technology right now is exploding but certain companies just
[7044.32 → 7050.16] certain are not doing anything it's yeah just, just pay attention to who's doing stuff that matters
[7050.16 → 7054.72] will last generation GPUs struggle with direct x12 based games really depends we've seen this go
[7054.72 → 7059.12] either way in the past if i imagine I'm a millionaire it doesn't mean I'm a millionaire you're right
[7060.00 → 7064.88] Oculus Rift is going to blow away everything we won't even need monitors anymore disagree
[7066.56 → 7070.56] what is cheap but a good motherboard for the new intel Haswell CPUs i think tiny tom Logan covered it
[7070.56 → 7075.04] perfectly MSI's gaming board is a great choice comes with onboard killer neck networking comes
[7075.04 → 7079.92] with a decent sound card if i was really going to go balls to the walls I'd probably grab a Maximus
[7079.92 → 7085.12] six formula or even something lower end like from their channel series but then throw a great sound
[7085.12 → 7092.24] card on it are you ever thinking of coming to the UK no not really not specifically the UK but um
[7093.04 → 7098.88] if everything kind of falls in line Brandon and i might be going to Gamescom next year well we'll see
[7098.88 → 7104.72] i want no promises see now you're making me like commit in public come on you got it you can do it
[7104.72 → 7111.44] uh okay I'll tell you what fine you'll go yes all right yes uh jams i hope you can watch the show too
[7112.00 → 7119.76] uh this is that is a fake program it's none of it is true i think he's probably talking about um
[7120.64 → 7126.72] the soccer thing oh yeah yeah i know just recently i started moving my contacts onto my Google cloud so
[7126.72 → 7131.04] the benefits of Google sync make it worth it for me, i don't remember what question i asked anymore but
[7131.04 → 7136.32] cool uh what's your favourite GTX 780 after market model well Asus has been the only one for a long
[7136.32 → 7142.64] time with a truly custom PCB model so i would go with them however MSI has the lightning now which i
[7142.64 → 7147.36] haven't checked out yet, but we have one coming i don't know if i told you that yet um galaxy has a
[7147.36 → 7152.00] really cool looking one actually i should probably ping them oh find out if we can get our hands is
[7152.00 → 7156.16] another white one it looks no i don't think it's white, but it's like, but it's pretty balls to the walls okay
[7156.16 → 7163.44] cool uh i love your show thank you also my crush lives near you okay ghost says have you considered
[7163.44 → 7168.00] that wireless charging and Wi-Fi data transfer will slowly become the new norm no more broken connectors
[7168.00 → 7173.44] definitely have considered definitely love it as long as i don't get too much cancer
[7174.00 → 7179.28] uh minus look it's a meme okay I'm afraid to click that sorry man yeah um how do i install the program
[7179.28 → 7183.92] during the windows' installation so i can install Windows 8 start menu from a clean install that's a really
[7183.92 → 7188.64] long answer it is possible though because you can inject things into, but it's more work than it's
[7188.64 → 7193.44] worth it's a lot of work just install one after you're done yeah uh first time watching live hello
[7193.44 → 7197.52] is there an after party today no i have to go home and make dinner for my wife one quick second i want
[7197.52 → 7201.68] to jump back to that thing even if you're doing big office deployments if you get nine night pro you
[7201.68 → 7207.28] can distribute classic start across your whole network yeah nine night uh they don't sponsor the wan show but
[7207.28 → 7211.60] they should because we love them, and we'll talk about them every week if if they don't
[7211.60 → 7218.72] sponsor it's like my favourite thing like things we love nine night Noctua um what do we love as much
[7218.72 → 7226.00] as nine night and Noctua Noctua Noctua
[7227.12 → 7234.08] i okay um what happened to build logs coming soon on this yeah this stream sorry about the previous
[7234.08 → 7240.32] weeks i won't switch to promos as my primary android maybe, but windows has legacy compatibility
[7240.32 → 7244.48] and what do you mean by closing doors good question uh they're just becoming a lot less open about their
[7244.48 → 7251.04] policies and the way that they develop new technologies um they're they're becoming a bit
[7251.04 → 7255.68] more walled garden i guess if you sort of look that term up which like that's a thing not even
[7255.68 → 7262.40] necessarily that walled garden compared to some companies but extremely walled garden compared to the old
[7262.40 → 7267.12] google what do you think of two five by four screens for gaming i think that's terrible
[7268.80 → 7271.92] there are huge issues with signal integrity transmitting ultra-high frequency data over
[7271.92 → 7280.96] meters of copper yes that's true however fine then intel came up with an idea well let's just make
[7280.96 → 7289.76] active cables part of the standard okay done do that then there's actually fine build a next generation
[7289.76 → 7296.48] technology you know what even make HDMI 2.0 you know active or not active red mirror i mean we even
[7296.48 → 7302.48] have active cables for HDMI we have a 50 foot HDMI 1.4 cable or whatever that look up red mirror cables
[7302.48 → 7308.64] yeah red mirror cables are awesome um anyway the point is there has to be a way to yeah figure that out so
[7310.32 → 7310.64] there
[7313.04 → 7318.96] will DisplayPort ever be updated no idea do you think games will be able to make their way in the chrome
[7318.96 → 7322.88] browser of course they will, they already have been i would say flash games but i don't even know
[7322.88 → 7328.32] what all those games run on anymore now that flash isn't a thing yeah um how about that sonic incident
[7328.32 → 7334.72] at pax is that you yeah we're not going to talk about that uh need a personal rig update yes apparently
[7334.72 → 7338.72] i need to talk more when there are guests, and probably you do too you know what it depends because
[7338.72 → 7343.76] i don't mind if the guest is really knowledgeable and is talking about something that we don't really
[7343.76 → 7348.80] have that much to contribute to in it in addition to what they're saying um and there's always going
[7348.80 → 7353.12] to be finding that balance we're pretty new to the whole hosting guests on the show thing and three
[7353.12 → 7357.60] people is an interesting balance and this week at least i was actually trying not to because my throat
[7357.60 → 7362.32] hurts quite a bit yeah if you notice he hasn't said much, and it seems like I'm just kind of talking
[7362.32 → 7369.20] about everything that's out of respect not the other way around and i don't want him to talk because
[7369.20 → 7376.72] uh i don't want to get sick so he can just keep his like germ factory inside his mouth um will you do
[7376.72 → 7381.36] an unboxing of the 780 lightning yes what is your opinion of the current state of the internet in the
[7381.36 → 7388.16] UK uh we don't know a lot we don't follow it that closely i know there was a whole thing with
[7388.16 → 7393.60] censorship a little while ago don't know if that's going through or not going through um so sorry I'm
[7393.60 → 7398.88] gonna I'm going to stay hands off on that one what is my honest opinion of raze rare they overpriced or do you
[7398.88 → 7405.60] pay for quality personally i love racer hashtag Linus butt plug um it's funny you should ask that
[7405.60 → 7412.48] because i don't necessarily have an opinion like an all-encompassing opinion of pretty much any company
[7412.48 → 7419.28] i form my opinions based on the product at hand in fact i ranted about this last week don't be a fanboy
[7419.28 → 7425.12] don't be an intel fanboy don't be a Microsoft fanboy don't be a Google fanboy and don't be a racer fanboy
[7425.12 → 7431.68] don't be any kind of fanboy evaluate the product for your needs when previously when we're like
[7431.68 → 7436.16] night at OCTU it's because every product that OCTU has come out with so far is ugly as hell and works
[7436.16 → 7442.24] really, really well yeah and we i mean and cyanite is just amazing, and we use it all the time, and it's
[7442.24 → 7446.08] perfect the only thing that's wrong with that right now actually is it has some problems with server
[7446.08 → 7450.88] revocation so you have to turn that off, but you just turn it back on it's fine okay so anyway um don't be a
[7450.88 → 7457.44] fanboy does razor have products that i think are absolutely fantastic yes the orb weaver is an
[7457.44 → 7464.00] unbelievably cool product if you wanted uh like a game pad like uh like the older Kostroma from belching
[7464.00 → 7469.20] or whatever else buy an orb weaver it's not that much more expensive than anything else full mechanical
[7469.20 → 7474.96] cherry AMEX blue switches awesome product vibrant led backlighting anything you could want the one
[7474.96 → 7480.32] thing i could complain about i guess is it doesn't have a braided cord and i have cats so they are they kill
[7480.32 → 7487.28] cords um something like the matrix outstanding product yeah great build quality great attention
[7487.28 → 7494.64] to detail targets a market of people who want that product and delivers great product blade 14
[7494.64 → 7499.44] unbelievable product it's amazing that two generations into building notebooks they turned
[7499.44 → 7506.40] that around look how long first one was we weren't huge fans of the first one but i mean look how
[7506.40 → 7512.40] long acres had to come out with blade 14 and razors like no we're just going to build this um do i think
[7512.40 → 7517.84] it's perfect no in fact in my unboxing i talked a lot about how i really don't like the screen they used
[7517.84 → 7523.76] there um so what's my honest opinion is I'll evaluate every product as it comes down the pipe
[7523.76 → 7529.44] and that's what you should do too all right i think we're going to call that uh good enough oh no
[7529.44 → 7536.80] there's one more tweet ah yeah stroke daddy go love the show thank you and now let's move into uh your
[7536.80 → 7543.60] thing okay so let me get the doc open i have some you can just use this here I've got it I've got it
[7544.56 → 7550.24] yeah, but you can screen share with them just use this just it's just open the ah you want me to open
[7550.24 → 7555.12] this doc yeah okay it's its the build logs of the week all right build logs of the week so you're
[7555.12 → 7563.28] going to download it yeah I'm downloading oh my PowerPoint on this computer oh dear uh oh this is
[7563.28 → 7571.68] this is a pretty new pretty, pretty new pc uh like that might actually be a problem is there yes i have
[7571.68 → 7580.48] it that would have been awesome all right so back to the desktop bill of the week September 6th uh okay
[7582.16 → 7586.40] what oh try no, no no, no i know what's wrong i know what's wrong because it's its defaulting to
[7586.40 → 7595.12] the wrong edition of office i just have to open with office the other one so yeah oh i see oh, oh no, no
[7595.12 → 7605.12] okay, okay so one thing that i want to propose and this is the first time you're hearing this as
[7605.12 → 7611.52] well actually okay um actually no I'm going to take that back until i build a system so that we can
[7611.52 → 7616.56] actually do it and then once i build the system then so you're not going to talk about it nope you
[7616.56 → 7622.96] have got to be kidding me everyone's wondering what it is now anyway there's a thread on the forum that
[7622.96 → 7627.84] we can't blast right now, but we'll be blasting soon I'll blast through twitter um, but this is I've
[7627.84 → 7632.80] been meaning to call this out for a long time, but we've been having a lot of problems with the show
[7632.80 → 7639.76] for a long time and i haven't been able to blast it out for a long time, so there's a section in i
[7639.76 → 7647.52] believe build logs no build planning that's what I'm actually pretty sure it's in um where this uh
[7647.52 → 7651.28] what's the user's name here we go corn on a Jacob awesome
[7654.16 → 7658.88] a corner on a Jacob in new builds and planning basically proposes a challenge and what you're
[7658.88 → 7663.92] supposed to do is theory craft a build for a specific person purpose at a specific price point
[7663.92 → 7670.80] and then he chooses winners um as far as i know there's no real bonus for winning, but it's fun it's
[7670.80 → 7675.60] kind of interesting you don't have to actually build the rig you just kind of theory craft the rig i
[7675.60 → 7679.92] think the kind of rules are that use pc part picker because it's just a lot easier for everyone
[7679.92 → 7686.00] to see what you're actually picking right which makes sense um but if you want to compete if you
[7686.00 → 7692.40] think you have better ideas than other people um check out this thread it's called the LTT build off
[7692.40 → 7699.44] thread no building required by corn on Jacob in the new builds and planning section, and it's just
[7699.44 → 7705.12] kind of cool I've been meaning to uh it's pinned so it'll be right at the top I've been meaning to call
[7705.12 → 7710.48] this out for a while and i told them i would call it out quite a while ago so hopefully
[7710.48 → 7717.20] you've got that um but yeah okay well apparently having two different editions of office open is
[7717.20 → 7722.96] kind of problem so we're going to have uh low colour depth build logs of the week this week
[7722.96 → 7731.04] unfortunately uh so let's go ahead and start with half x mod by indie yet so first thing you'll notice
[7731.04 → 7739.60] is some super cool mounted SSDs love that which is just awesome i love how we did that right there
[7739.60 → 7744.32] right on right angle connectors right through the side really nice cables blah blah blah blah but then
[7744.32 → 7750.00] you scroll down look so terrible oh I'll just so I'll open it on here okay I'll open it on here and then
[7750.00 → 7755.36] we'll just um yeah we'll just we'll just make it because the picture looks a lot better than that yeah that
[7755.36 → 7762.56] looks so terrible bad all right here we go so we're just going to go we'll just full screen on here
[7763.12 → 7771.76] and uh no i would not like PowerPoint on this computer yes i do yes i do all right here we go
[7771.76 → 7779.68] really don't know there's some serious glare okay, okay remove add screen region all right
[7779.68 → 7787.60] ah there we go yes all right boom so some pretty hard for glare, but he's got a window in there
[7788.16 → 7792.48] there you go so window if you didn't notice already that you can see through the side there is a window
[7792.48 → 7797.84] on their yeah damn angled fittings look really sharp it looks like it's not filled yet but uh I'm guessing
[7797.84 → 7802.24] you have other slides that show that off a little bit better love nickel plated blocks those are gorgeous
[7802.24 → 7808.40] blocks what are those i did not actually specifically grab that yeah we should have that hard pipe uh
[7808.40 → 7815.60] that's right there by mesmerized by his SSD mounting all right, so there's another shot of it now it's uh
[7815.60 → 7820.96] at least the res is full that's kind of interesting because these tubes are sort of oh i guess it's
[7820.96 → 7827.44] uh red Lexi res yeah interesting all right so I'm guessing those are EK blocks based on that that's
[7827.44 → 7831.92] an EK CPU block and unless you're kind of an EK fanboy i can't think of another reason to use an EK CPU
[7831.92 → 7839.44] block wow all right shots fired connect with her by MGR this one is freaking fantastic this is this
[7839.44 → 7844.56] is where he started, so there 's's one shot before this where he only has two hard drives in
[7844.56 → 7850.00] but basically this is where the whole thing begins is he's like okay I'm going to build a hard drive cage
[7850.00 → 7855.68] and then he has to build off that because this has to be a full computer this is where it ends so he just
[7855.68 → 7862.72] keeps adding little areas and mounting things in here and if you notice he's got a big freaking CPU
[7862.72 → 7868.08] cooler, and he had to add a graphics card so he's got an extension cable, and he just built a little
[7868.08 → 7872.56] hang off the side thing there's a better shot from for it if you go forward i got one more picture for
[7872.56 → 7878.32] this one i should have done three pictures for the last one as well um that's edentulous he decided he
[7878.32 → 7883.84] had to put a video card in so he just like built a little like thing there's a little like PCI Express
[7883.84 → 7890.24] extension and there's a thing here and then like it's unbelievable that's awesome it's so cool
[7891.52 → 7898.80] love if it's just awesome absolutely love it that's hilarious all right what else you got here so
[7899.60 → 7904.24] so check out the check-out the theory crafting thing check out those build uh bill logs of the week
[7904.24 → 7909.36] those will be in the featured build logs of the week section that is pinned in build logs at the
[7909.36 → 7916.72] very top by wind speed those will be there at some point um also I'm going to be putting up a thread
[7916.72 → 7922.40] fairly soon asking you guys whether you think we should have a gaming specific channel or
[7922.40 → 7926.88] whether we should keep the gaming content that you the style of gaming content you saw at pax and
[7926.88 → 7932.48] our future ideas for gaming content on the Linus tech tips channel so if we should have one giant channel
[7932.48 → 7938.64] that does absolutely everything or if we should have another because we have a few already bearing
[7938.64 → 7944.08] in mind my devil's advocate thing here is another channel to maintain is another channel to maintain
[7944.08 → 7951.04] it's another set of assets whether it's pre-rolls or intros or outros or whatever else um it's another
[7951.04 → 7958.32] thing for people to be subscribed to and to follow along with it's another you know um yeah i see a lot of
[7958.32 → 7963.92] challenges with having another channel but if you guys feel very strongly about not having gaming
[7963.92 → 7969.92] content on the Linus tech tips channel then it's something we could potentially look into because
[7969.92 → 7977.20] i mean the reason for tech quickie versus Linus tech tips the reason that exists is because i wanted to
[7977.20 → 7983.76] keep like paid commercials content off of the Linus tech tips yeah um whereas none of this would be paid
[7983.76 → 7989.44] content anyway, so guys will ultimately what i told him because i think he believes that a better
[7989.44 → 7994.88] a new channel would be better what i told him is let's let you all decide yep so I'm going to be putting
[7994.88 → 8001.20] up a post on the forum, and we will have it go to vote because this is ultimately your guys um speaking
[8001.20 → 8008.24] of the forum the Linus tech tips forum is now in the 96th overall position for folding at home top 100
[8008.24 → 8013.20] even though it's only been running for less than a year and that means that there are teams that are ancient and
[8013.20 → 8019.84] and by to show that off we have we're in ninth position for active folders yeah ninth that's crazy
[8019.84 → 8027.20] that's nuts so we have almost a thousand team members 250 is of width are actually active and
[8027.20 → 8033.76] the brink team is 372nd worldwide which is actually quite good as well and has 95 members with 54 active
[8034.32 → 8039.92] and badges will be distributed to brink and folding members uh once you hit certain milestones if you're
[8039.92 → 8044.00] more interested there are posts about that and if you're wondering why you're not getting a badge
[8044.00 → 8049.28] feel free to pm whaler underscore 99 on the forum so thank you guys very much for tuning into this
[8049.28 → 8058.32] week's away show um i think that's about it tune in next week at approximately this time I'm going to go
[8058.32 → 8063.36] drink some tea approximately two hours and 20 minutes ago this was a long show it was you know what I'd love
[8063.36 → 8068.24] to hear yeah hit me up on Twitter after the show here this is just sort of a random aside let me know
[8068.24 → 8075.36] what you think the optimal length for the wan show is I'd love to hear what you guys think um
[8078.40 → 8084.56] no i wanted to call it uh or whatever you came up with but yeah oh and if you think it would make
[8084.56 → 8089.84] sense for us to start doing a much shorter like I'm thinking like 15 20 minutes like two to three
[8089.84 → 8095.28] topics tops but um, and it would have a different name which i don't want to reveal yet okay until we've
[8095.28 → 8100.32] launched why i didn't but uh let me know what you guys think you know do you like the one once per
[8100.32 → 8106.24] week long thing or would you like it to be split up or would you like a hybrid model of both of them
[8106.24 → 8110.16] let me know what you think hit me up on Twitter i can't promise to reply to all the tweets but i
[8110.16 → 8125.20] i will read them all so good night everybody good night guys
[8125.20 → 8144.32] reminder guys that squarespace.com offer code linus9, and it's 20 off new accounts
[8144.32 → 8149.36] comments just a reminder you can go now
[8149.36 → 8153.44] why are you still here
[8153.44 → 8163.04] the show is over, and we're back a new episode of the wet no no we're done
