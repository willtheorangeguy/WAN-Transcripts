[0.00 → 1.00] Uh oh!
[1.00 → 4.00] It worked, but then it was like, uh oh!
[4.00 → 6.00] Sorry, that's my ringtone.
[6.00 → 12.50] Alright, so guys, welcome to the WAN show, the weekly show where we make asses of ourselves
[12.50 → 13.80] on a regular basis.
[13.80 → 17.80] We actually have some corrections from last week's show that I would like to get right
[17.80 → 19.26] out of the way here at the beginning.
[19.26 → 26.32] So number one correction is that if you fire a bullet straight up into the air, terminal
[26.32 → 31.08] velocity and wind resistance and all that stuff, it's not coming down at exactly the
[31.08 → 33.32] same speed that it was when it's going up and-
[33.32 → 34.32] I said that.
[34.32 → 36.32] Yeah, well, I didn't.
[36.32 → 37.32] Okay.
[37.32 → 39.56] So I'm correcting myself, if that's okay with you.
[39.56 → 44.20] So if it's fired straight up into the air, the odds of it actually killing someone are
[44.20 → 45.20] extremely low.
[45.20 → 51.12] However, what we were talking about was shooting down drones, in which case you wouldn't necessarily
[51.12 → 52.68] be firing up directly in the air-
[52.68 → 53.68] It still has the same effects.
[53.68 → 58.40] MythBusters busted the myth that firing straight up will cause it to come down at the same speed,
[58.40 → 62.64] but what they also found is that if you fire up at an angle, there is a very good chance
[62.64 → 63.68] that it would kill someone.
[63.68 → 64.68] Yeah.
[64.68 → 67.44] Because it maintains a lot of its forward momentum regardless of the whole falling speed
[67.44 → 68.44] and whatnot.
[68.44 → 69.44] It might still be flipping and stuff.
[69.44 → 74.28] So we were technically wrong, but it's still dangerous if people shoot at drones.
[74.28 → 75.38] So that's number one.
[75.38 → 79.68] Another correction from last week is that HDMI 2.0 does have support for 8K.
[79.68 → 83.52] It's just the reason that we didn't give any cares about it is that it's at 30 frames per
[83.52 → 85.40] second or 24 or something like that.
[85.40 → 86.40] So it's like-
[86.40 → 88.40] And weren't we also specifically talking about 1.4?
[88.40 → 91.92] Yes, we were specifically talking about 1.4 at that point in time.
[91.92 → 92.92] All right.
[92.92 → 97.76] We were a little bit simplistic about the whole Walmart thing and sort of the supply chain
[97.76 → 98.64] and how much things cost.
[98.64 → 101.64] So there was an article here that was linked to me.
[101.64 → 102.64] It's on Google+.
[102.64 → 106.68] Linus, I'm a fan, but your extremely simplistic explanation of the cost of bringing in a product
[106.68 → 109.60] was unbelievably condescending and just plain wrong.
[109.60 → 110.60] So there you guys have it.
[110.60 → 113.64] You can check that out on Google+, where I said, good point.
[113.64 → 114.92] We'll discuss on the next show.
[114.92 → 119.92] But one of the objections that this particular viewer had was that 30 years ago, the average
[119.92 → 124.16] ratio of what the mean income of a worker at a company versus the CEO was, was about 30
[124.16 → 126.38] to 1, whereas now it's about 270 to 1.
[126.38 → 131.06] And that is a completely separate issue, one that does need to be addressed at some point.
[131.06 → 137.32] And that Linus Media Group definitely believes firmly in fighting, because I actually don't
[137.32 → 138.92] get paid much more than anyone else who works here.
[138.92 → 142.10] That 30 to 1 is not a thing.
[142.10 → 144.36] I can strive for that 30 to 1.
[144.36 → 147.64] I will be pretty impressed with myself if I manage to pull that up.
[147.64 → 150.98] Although I think companies that have 30 to 1 are like giant national chains and stuff.
[150.98 → 151.98] Well, yes.
[151.98 → 152.98] Not four-person teams.
[152.98 → 157.60] Well, four-person teams could still, I could just, I could just take all the money.
[157.60 → 158.60] Yes.
[158.60 → 160.60] I don't even know if that would still equate.
[160.60 → 164.60] If I paid everyone minimum wage.
[164.60 → 167.48] Minimum wage and still took everything, I still don't think you'd make it.
[167.48 → 170.04] And we'd like to lose the house.
[170.04 → 171.24] Oh, all the sad face.
[171.24 → 171.64] All right.
[171.92 → 174.60] So we have some great topics for you guys today.
[174.72 → 179.66] Number one is Haswell-y specs have been allegedly leaked.
[179.82 → 180.82] Perhaps they're right.
[180.90 → 181.76] Perhaps they're not.
[181.86 → 182.74] We don't know.
[182.92 → 188.34] But there was an article posted that seems to have some either correct specs or what look
[188.34 → 190.44] like fairly realistic fake specs.
[190.88 → 193.40] Also, the smart bra could be a thing.
[194.02 → 194.82] Is it for women?
[195.10 → 195.86] Is it for gamers?
[196.12 → 196.80] We don't know.
[196.80 → 200.98] Also, our guest today is Anand from Anand Tech.
[201.14 → 204.30] So, the guy who got me into PCs.
[204.76 → 209.44] If you guys like built your first PC by watching our videos, then he's like the equivalent of
[209.44 → 210.08] that for me.
[210.16 → 214.82] Because reading his articles was what really got me passionate about computers and technology.
[215.06 → 218.80] So I'm extremely excited to have him joining us in about 25 minutes here.
[219.12 → 222.44] And then we've also got some other cool stuff before we fire up that intro.
[222.44 → 227.70] So we've got consumer hard drives versus enterprise hard drives in terms of reliability.
[228.04 → 228.90] There was a test done.
[229.30 → 229.90] Kind of.
[230.48 → 231.26] We'll talk about it later.
[231.26 → 232.38] It's observations of an environment.
[234.02 → 238.96] And then there are a bunch of Xbox One trolls and a bunch of iPhone trolls.
[239.32 → 241.48] And this is getting hilarious but consistent.
[241.82 → 244.76] And I feel bad, but it's still hilarious.
[244.76 → 248.16] So without further ado, let's get on with the show.
[248.16 → 275.64] So guys, our number one sponsor of the show today is Hotspot Shield.
[275.64 → 278.58] The easy, quick-to-install VPN solution.
[278.90 → 281.42] And our second sponsor is Intel today.
[281.80 → 288.10] Buy a qualifying 4th generation Core i7 or Core i5 processor and get a free copy of Rome 2 Total War.
[288.30 → 292.86] This is for a limited time and unfortunately, sorry guys, only from select retailers.
[293.00 → 294.72] So that's in Canada and the US.
[294.96 → 297.64] But either way, make sure that you check that out.
[297.64 → 313.38] So without further ado, why don't we get into our first topic here, which is that Oculus has gotten a massive $75 million in additional funding to jumpstart the virtual reality business.
[313.58 → 315.62] So this was posted on the forum by Top War Gamer.
[315.62 → 318.50] The original article is from TheVerge.com.
[318.62 → 320.36] And how excited are you about this?
[320.42 → 327.28] Because you're probably the biggest Oculus fanboy in like, it's probably a hundred kilometres square from here at least.
[327.44 → 328.20] Probably, actually.
[328.40 → 335.14] Did I tell you for like my family Christmas thing, I'm bringing my computer and Oculus home, so everyone can try it?
[335.30 → 336.30] Did I tell you about that?
[336.52 → 336.76] No.
[336.76 → 340.34] We have people like coming in from Eastern Canada to visit us and all this kind of stuff.
[340.40 → 341.90] My mom was like, oh, we need an activity.
[342.04 → 344.22] I was like, we can all play Oculus Rift.
[344.56 → 346.30] So she was down, so we're doing that.
[346.42 → 347.56] Wow, that is awesome.
[347.88 → 351.56] That might extend that range that you just came up with by a little bit.
[351.76 → 355.84] Family Christmas at Luke's family's house.
[356.76 → 357.12] Seriously?
[358.12 → 358.52] 100%.
[358.52 → 359.46] I'm stoked.
[359.78 → 360.26] There we go.
[360.26 → 360.86] All right.
[360.86 → 368.84] So a lot of this money is going towards actually like producing, making and getting ready to sell.
[368.88 → 369.84] Mass production.
[370.30 → 371.50] Like making it happen.
[371.64 → 374.94] I mean, the development, they already kind of spent that money.
[374.94 → 375.36] They have them, yeah.
[375.50 → 376.58] They kind of have them now.
[377.40 → 378.90] But that's...
[378.90 → 380.04] They need way more of them.
[380.04 → 386.12] As everyone on Kickstarter ever discovered, there's a lot more to raising the funding
[386.12 → 391.14] to bring a product to market than just covering the cost of having it manufactured and then
[391.14 → 392.64] kind of going...
[392.64 → 394.32] Yeah, we're done.
[394.38 → 394.54] Yeah.
[394.60 → 395.92] So that's what a lot of the money is going to.
[396.24 → 399.68] And an interesting quote from one of the big investors who's now going to be on the board
[399.68 → 401.04] because he invested so much money.
[401.40 → 404.98] Or not exact quote, but basically what he was saying was when he saw the developer kit,
[404.98 → 408.64] he wasn't 100% sold, and he wasn't ready to invest, which I completely understand.
[408.64 → 413.00] Because when you have the developer kit, you can see all these pixels, and you can actually
[413.00 → 415.36] like easily see the grid in between the pixels.
[415.36 → 416.20] And you have one, right?
[416.28 → 416.50] Yeah.
[416.60 → 416.78] Yeah.
[417.06 → 420.20] And it's wonderful, but you can still see the pixels.
[420.36 → 421.64] So it's still kind of a rough experience.
[422.08 → 426.74] And he said that once he saw the consumer version, which is a higher resolution, he was sold
[426.74 → 428.34] and he was ready to invest all that money.
[428.44 → 432.54] So that actually makes me super stoked because I haven't tried the high-res version yet, which
[432.54 → 433.74] like, man, I'm stoked.
[433.74 → 435.80] Because that's one of the biggest things that I find holding it back.
[435.80 → 439.70] And for me personally, what I'm really excited for is the consumer version to be released,
[440.06 → 443.48] a bunch of people to buy it, and then people start building accessories for it.
[443.54 → 445.36] Like when we were testing the Omni.
[445.64 → 445.92] Yeah.
[445.92 → 448.00] The gun that was there was not super great.
[448.20 → 452.38] I was so sad when I saw Jan's Shark Tank appearance.
[452.54 → 456.30] I don't know if you guys watch Shark Tank, but Jan, I can't remember his last name, but
[456.30 → 457.64] he's a super nice guy.
[457.64 → 465.02] He actually, if you search for Virtual Omni on YouTube, him walking us through like a
[465.02 → 466.96] tour of the product is one of the first hits.
[467.32 → 468.20] He's a great guy.
[468.34 → 471.96] He invented the Omni, and he was on Shark Tank.
[472.10 → 477.02] I think his issue was he was asking for too much money for too small a share in the company
[477.02 → 480.42] because otherwise I think they wouldn't have been so harsh.
[480.56 → 485.94] But they basically just said, I think the lady potential investor said something like,
[486.02 → 489.38] if my husband brought this home, I'd divorce him or something like that.
[489.44 → 494.86] And I mean, I understand that from a mainstream perspective, but we need, we need guys like
[494.86 → 500.42] Jan, and we need guys building accessories for this and turning it into more than just a
[500.42 → 502.48] thing you put on your head and sit in your chair.
[502.76 → 503.30] We need things.
[503.30 → 505.84] In fact, where'd, ah, where'd my stinky footboard go?
[506.00 → 510.52] We need things that enhance the way that you interact with your PC, whether it's the tongue
[510.52 → 515.62] controller that that valve employee developed or the buttocks controller or foot pedals, all
[515.62 → 519.04] these different ways that go beyond keyboard or mouse and be on the controller.
[519.30 → 523.94] That debate of keyboard mouse versus controller might just be completely dead in another five
[523.94 → 524.18] years.
[524.22 → 525.48] And I'm extremely excited to see that.
[525.52 → 526.72] Anyway, sorry, I hijacked your topic.
[526.86 → 527.54] Yeah, no, it's all good.
[527.64 → 531.86] Because one of the biggest things I've found with fairly extended use with the Oculus is when
[531.86 → 534.90] you want to start doing more things, a keyboard and mouse is not ideal.
[535.12 → 537.20] Believe me, freaking love keyboard and mouse.
[537.42 → 541.86] But when you have an Oculus on your face, and you do a 180 in your chair, it's not really
[541.86 → 542.82] going to work out so well.
[543.66 → 545.78] You can't be like, uh, I got this.
[545.78 → 547.02] We need wireless Oculus.
[547.36 → 548.56] We really need wireless Oculus.
[548.56 → 549.76] We need wireless Oculus for one.
[549.82 → 552.92] Or we need some type of cable management system that can swivel with you.
[553.08 → 553.56] Oh, okay.
[553.64 → 556.88] Where it's like, oh, you know what could probably be done even now?
[556.88 → 559.76] And this is going to sound super dorky, but think about this.
[560.10 → 565.52] If you could get, um, like even something crazy like Easel's 2600 William hour battery
[565.52 → 565.80] pack.
[565.88 → 571.28] Like if you carry, like if you had like a like almost a backpack based battery, whether
[571.28 → 574.54] it's DC or AC, depending on how you would power all the other stuff.
[574.64 → 579.58] And then a wireless HDMI kit, which are actually, you can get them for around a hundred or 200
[579.58 → 580.46] bucks these days.
[580.82 → 582.88] That could be a pretty good DIY.
[582.88 → 585.48] People have been doing concept art of the whole idea.
[585.58 → 588.96] They've been thinking of backpacks that were specially made for it so that they're, they
[588.96 → 590.12] don't stick out way too far.
[590.24 → 590.42] Right.
[590.42 → 593.66] So they're slimline against your back and different stuff like that with big flat battery.
[593.76 → 593.98] Yeah.
[594.46 → 594.82] Brilliant.
[594.98 → 599.36] So something like that coming out, um, better guns, which are more realistic coming out
[599.36 → 603.48] so that you could have, so you could have mags on your belt, and you take one out and
[603.48 → 607.12] put it like drop it or do whatever and then, or put it in your belt and then take another
[607.12 → 607.80] one, load it in.
[607.82 → 609.06] And that's how you reload your gun.
[609.42 → 610.96] Uh, stuff like that would be fantastic.
[610.96 → 613.74] Just all these different accessories, which will make it so much better.
[613.74 → 618.62] And then something like an Omni so that you don't have to sit in this chair with a keyboard
[618.62 → 618.90] and mouse.
[618.96 → 621.84] Cause right now that's the most awkward thing is not the Oculus.
[622.14 → 625.66] It's all the other things that you have to do with the Oculus paired with the resolution
[625.66 → 626.02] issues.
[626.14 → 629.36] So once the resolution issues are solved and all these accessories come out, this could
[629.36 → 630.68] be freaking awesome.
[632.00 → 633.40] Oh man, I'm stoked.
[634.20 → 634.64] Jeez.
[634.64 → 639.28] So stoked that you don't even have to get an Oculus for Christmas to make it the central
[639.28 → 640.12] part of your Christmas.
[640.80 → 641.08] Yeah.
[641.20 → 641.50] Yeah.
[641.76 → 642.06] All right.
[642.76 → 644.02] I'll just bring it there.
[644.28 → 649.74] Speaking of more extremely exciting news, Steam OS is available today.
[649.82 → 653.36] We've actually, we're, we're going to make this one of our main discussion points with
[653.36 → 654.46] Anand when he arrives.
[654.58 → 658.48] So I don't want to get too much into it, but, uh, we can talk about Steam OS.
[658.64 → 660.92] Actually, I mean, I guess it's slightly different.
[660.92 → 664.28] I'll be talking with him about Steam box, not Steam OS.
[664.50 → 664.70] Yeah.
[664.98 → 668.82] But a Steam box is just a box with Steam OS on it and hardware in it.
[668.92 → 673.14] So anyway, this was posted by Guns Cool on the forum and the original article is from
[673.14 → 678.84] the Verge with, um, basically just an announcement that Steam OS will be available to download on
[678.84 → 679.92] Lucky Friday the 13th.
[680.76 → 688.48] And beyond that, Valve is shipping out those 300 prototype Steam boxes that they had, whoops,
[688.48 → 691.36] I'm on the wrong scene here, that they had promised.
[691.90 → 696.74] And, uh, a few lucky people are getting a very early look at Steam OS and Steam box.
[696.84 → 703.94] Now, to be clear, um, they're not really recommending that people just run out, download Steam OS,
[703.94 → 710.40] and then chuck it on any old PC, unless they're experienced Linux hacks or people that are,
[710.52 → 716.00] that are pretty good at that sort of thing already, because it is not ready at all.
[716.56 → 720.72] Plus, the learning curve will be a little bit steeper than if you're just installing Windows,
[720.84 → 726.18] where it's just like, put in USB, press OK, press OK, press OK, enter a product key, and you're done.
[726.18 → 730.40] I'm thinking that if it becomes available, like, I haven't, I haven't seen, if someone
[730.40 → 733.42] has a download link for it, like, I've gone to the Steam OS page, and it says download will
[733.42 → 736.02] be available soon, I don't know if that's actually where they're releasing it, because
[736.02 → 736.50] it's in beta.
[736.86 → 740.30] So if someone has the proper download page, if you could tweet it to me or spam it in
[740.30 → 741.40] chat or something, that would be awesome.
[741.88 → 745.46] And I might try and see if I can tinker with it and if I can get it working easily enough
[745.46 → 746.02] over the weekend.
[746.16 → 748.84] Do you think we should do benchmarks or do you think we should wait for the official release?
[748.84 → 749.70] You know what?
[749.92 → 756.88] I am actually less interested in benchmarking Steam OS from a local play perspective.
[757.62 → 757.92] OK.
[758.08 → 762.46] And I am more interested in benchmarking Steam OS from a network play perspective.
[762.48 → 763.30] But that should work.
[763.74 → 764.16] It should.
[764.44 → 764.66] Yeah.
[765.12 → 771.22] So that, but to me, building the powerful Steam box doesn't actually make a ton of sense.
[771.28 → 771.38] No.
[771.54 → 773.30] If network play works well.
[773.54 → 773.70] Yeah.
[773.82 → 775.72] Which I don't see why it wouldn't.
[775.72 → 782.30] And we're so close to consumer grade 10 gigabits LAN that we could be looking at, with compression,
[782.94 → 789.20] 4K streaming by the time 4K TVs are really available and affordable and good.
[789.96 → 793.40] So with all of that in mind, I just don't think we need powerful graphics cards in these
[793.40 → 793.60] things.
[793.92 → 799.54] So what I would like to take a look at more than anything else is the latency of the network
[799.54 → 799.84] streaming.
[800.06 → 804.30] So I actually, all the things I got today, I got so much cool stuff today, you guys.
[804.30 → 806.44] We got a new lens from Sigma.
[806.70 → 809.16] It's a 24 to 105, I think.
[809.26 → 810.70] 24 to 105 millimetre lens.
[810.80 → 811.58] It's an F4.
[812.06 → 814.42] The sharpness should be just outstanding.
[814.54 → 815.76] Some of their new stuff has been great.
[816.08 → 819.26] We've got our 4K recorder for the Sony FS700 camera.
[819.58 → 822.94] So we are ready to rock with a sharp new lens and our 4K recorder.
[823.56 → 823.72] Huh.
[823.90 → 824.92] So excited about that.
[824.92 → 829.38] I got, okay, this, I mean, I guess it doesn't sound as exciting as that stuff, but this
[829.38 → 834.82] is the one I was about to say, was I got a USB to gigabit Ethernet adapter for my Shield.
[835.60 → 836.94] So, what's up?
[837.74 → 838.72] I'm just concerned.
[838.72 → 839.72] What?
[840.86 → 841.66] The title's wrong.
[841.80 → 841.96] It's all.
[842.02 → 842.20] Keep going.
[842.22 → 842.58] It's not wrong.
[843.04 → 843.64] Well, okay.
[843.66 → 844.74] I guess we should say we're live now.
[844.82 → 845.00] Fine.
[846.84 → 848.44] So, right.
[848.60 → 850.38] So I got a USB to gigabit Ethernet adapter.
[850.46 → 856.90] So that means I'm going to be able to run Nvidia Shield in 1080p mode on my TV rather than relying
[856.90 → 859.26] on wireless and being limited to 720p.
[859.68 → 865.26] So what we can do is because we just picked up one of these babies.
[866.36 → 867.18] Yeah, that's right.
[867.62 → 873.36] And because we have a Shield and because, if you can figure it out, we'll have SteamOS
[873.36 → 877.38] set up, we could actually look at these different streaming solutions, which I really think is
[877.38 → 878.00] the future.
[878.32 → 883.16] Not necessarily streaming over the WAN, over the internet, but streaming to yourself,
[883.16 → 887.62] to all your devices locally is extremely exciting to me.
[887.84 → 888.24] Extremely?
[888.36 → 888.64] Get it?
[888.90 → 889.30] Oh!
[890.48 → 893.58] It's extremely exciting to me, and I'd like to have a look at how all these solutions
[893.58 → 894.42] are comparing to each other.
[894.52 → 895.34] So stay tuned, guys.
[895.50 → 899.34] That is definitely something that we're going to be looking into later.
[899.44 → 904.16] Okay, apparently we do have a link, and you can download SteamOS right now.
[904.18 → 905.12] That's so ghetto.
[905.40 → 905.98] That's awesome.
[906.08 → 907.98] It's a super ghetto, like, FTP.
[908.68 → 909.26] Oh, wow.
[909.32 → 910.08] That's amazing.
[910.54 → 911.52] I love you, Valve.
[912.00 → 912.46] All right.
[912.46 → 912.60] Wow.
[913.16 → 915.88] So, let's get into our first headline topic.
[915.96 → 919.64] I actually don't even, I don't even think this qualifies as a headline topic.
[919.76 → 920.38] I mean, come on, man.
[920.50 → 921.04] Oh, I'm stoked.
[921.16 → 924.92] But it's more like a rapid fire topic, but we're just turning it into a headline topic
[924.92 → 925.82] because whatever.
[926.14 → 926.52] Because it's awesome.
[926.90 → 927.28] All right.
[927.40 → 930.02] So, this was posted by Nice Hat on the forum.
[930.72 → 935.68] Microsoft's new smart bra stops you from emotionally overeating.
[937.74 → 938.22] Okay.
[938.98 → 939.38] So.
[939.38 → 945.02] All right.
[945.06 → 945.30] All right.
[945.36 → 945.58] Okay.
[945.66 → 946.06] So, hold on.
[946.10 → 946.30] Hold on.
[946.34 → 948.02] Let's be mature for a second here.
[948.02 → 948.30] Luke.
[949.64 → 951.14] Can we be mature for a second?
[951.60 → 951.90] What?
[951.94 → 953.20] I say the word boobies and you laugh.
[953.36 → 954.06] Is that how this works?
[954.32 → 955.44] I actually didn't laugh at that.
[955.56 → 956.22] No, but brassiere.
[956.60 → 956.76] No.
[956.76 → 957.14] Smart bra?
[957.30 → 957.48] No.
[957.86 → 958.36] Not even smart.
[958.36 → 958.88] Smart bra.
[958.88 → 962.40] Smart bra.
[962.46 → 963.34] That's where you draw the line.
[963.46 → 963.56] Okay.
[963.76 → 966.46] So, it actually has a control board on it.
[966.96 → 973.44] It has sensors for detecting your stress levels as well as your heart rates.
[974.44 → 976.36] And, okay.
[976.44 → 979.38] Basically, it's a wearable stress sensor.
[979.38 → 980.22] You know, okay.
[980.50 → 981.78] I'm all for wearable tech.
[982.06 → 986.50] And, if it did something else, I would probably be like, oh, that's pretty cool.
[986.66 → 988.24] But, it tells you to stop eating.
[988.84 → 990.30] Which is like, really?
[992.08 → 993.36] Now, hold on a second.
[993.58 → 996.16] Now, the claim right now.
[996.36 → 998.52] So, the designer, when asked about a male version.
[998.62 → 999.28] Because, it's like, what?
[999.36 → 1000.86] So, only women need to stop eating?
[1000.94 → 1001.64] Is that what you're trying to say?
[1001.64 → 1001.82] Okay.
[1001.94 → 1006.84] So, the designer said her team did try to develop a version for men.
[1007.02 → 1011.98] But, that male underwear is too far away from the heart for an accurate EKG rating.
[1015.08 → 1017.60] So, basically, it'll only work for women.
[1017.62 → 1022.36] I mean, unless men could wear brassieres, then it would work, in theory.
[1022.80 → 1023.02] Yeah.
[1023.14 → 1026.34] But, then you could just buy the ladies' version as long as they don't make it just sort of pink and frilly.
[1026.34 → 1026.84] I mean, okay.
[1026.92 → 1027.58] Wearable tech.
[1028.34 → 1029.22] Extremely exciting.
[1029.22 → 1037.02] But, I think, for now, to put the amount of processing power into something to make it legitimately useful,
[1037.34 → 1041.02] we're going to be looking at this kind of wearable tech, or this kind of wearable tech,
[1041.16 → 1044.12] and not so many socks and brassieres and all that kind of stuff.
[1044.20 → 1044.40] Okay.
[1044.50 → 1049.28] If they had a smart brassier, so that it could tell your phone your heart rate.
[1050.42 → 1050.96] Well, probably can.
[1051.08 → 1054.52] But, it didn't bleed outgoing, oh, my God, you're eating too much.
[1054.56 → 1056.12] That would make so much more sense to me.
[1056.12 → 1059.62] If it was affordable, okay, that's fine.
[1059.72 → 1063.16] Because, you could, hey, if it was a sports bra, you could track your heart rate while running.
[1063.40 → 1063.68] Okay.
[1063.80 → 1065.12] And, you wouldn't have to wear any extra stuff.
[1065.14 → 1067.30] So, you don't mind if it's a piece of athletic gear?
[1067.50 → 1069.88] I don't even care if it's a piece of personal gear.
[1069.96 → 1070.40] It doesn't matter.
[1070.48 → 1075.24] I just, I think it's kind of insane that it's like, because, one, it's going to go off at all the wrong times.
[1075.58 → 1075.70] Yeah.
[1075.70 → 1076.48] I already brought this up with you.
[1076.62 → 1077.44] You're going to be in a movie.
[1077.56 → 1080.42] You're going to be enjoying the movie and get really into it, and your heart rate's going to go up.
[1080.42 → 1084.66] And, you're like, you're going to take a bite of popcorn, and it's going to be like, buzz, buzz, buzz.
[1084.68 → 1085.64] You're overstressed.
[1085.92 → 1086.52] Stop eating.
[1086.58 → 1087.40] Do you think it vibrates?
[1087.40 → 1087.56] It's like, no.
[1087.66 → 1088.72] Do you think it texts your phone?
[1088.80 → 1088.84] No.
[1088.84 → 1089.56] How do you think it works?
[1089.60 → 1090.40] You don't think it vibrates?
[1090.50 → 1091.50] It communicates with your phone.
[1091.98 → 1092.66] It doesn't vibrate.
[1093.24 → 1094.50] You could keep your phone in your bra.
[1094.82 → 1095.10] You could.
[1095.10 → 1095.92] And then that could vibrate.
[1096.00 → 1096.26] Yes.
[1097.36 → 1097.86] All right.
[1098.86 → 1102.36] But, like, yeah, you're going to be at a movie, you're going to be eating, and then it's going to freak out.
[1102.36 → 1104.10] So, the original article was from Extreme Tech.
[1104.22 → 1105.98] I think I had forgotten to say that before.
[1106.36 → 1108.66] I want to make sure that giving credit where credit is due.
[1109.42 → 1110.88] And I don't even.
[1110.96 → 1111.68] You know what, guys?
[1111.76 → 1113.58] Hit us on the Twitter blitz for this one.
[1113.74 → 1119.78] Let's do a Twitter blitz right after this topic, right after this next topic and before Anand joins us.
[1119.78 → 1123.94] Because it's just told us your thoughts on 140 characters or fewer.
[1124.32 → 1125.22] Minus Tech on Twitter.
[1125.74 → 1127.40] And I think that's about all we have to say.
[1127.46 → 1131.00] So, let's do one of our rapid fire topics here.
[1131.06 → 1132.14] We actually got quite a few.
[1132.36 → 1132.84] You know what?
[1132.92 → 1135.84] This is something that was news, apparently.
[1136.08 → 1138.18] If you press enter right after it, it turns into a link.
[1138.22 → 1140.70] Yeah, that's good that it does that, because that's annoying.
[1141.26 → 1144.88] It's a lot better than Excel, where you have to actually highlight it into the field.
[1145.10 → 1145.80] It's ridiculous.
[1146.06 → 1146.20] Okay.
[1146.28 → 1147.50] So, this was posted online.
[1147.56 → 1148.42] This Tech Tips forum.
[1148.60 → 1150.68] And apparently, I'm on page two.
[1150.78 → 1150.92] Oh, no.
[1150.96 → 1151.30] Here we go.
[1151.64 → 1158.86] So, by Snow Comet, Sony announced a micro-USB thumb drive for Android devices that is small enough to carry at all times.
[1158.94 → 1160.70] It has a standard USB connector on one end.
[1160.70 → 1162.82] So, you can see standard USB here.
[1162.90 → 1164.06] So, that goes right into your port.
[1164.34 → 1166.36] And then it has micro-USB on the other end.
[1166.36 → 1173.84] It has on-the-go functionality, meaning that on Android 4.0.3 or later, apparently 4.4 is not yet supported, so that's kind of interesting.
[1173.84 → 1179.18] You can have 8 gigs, 16 gigs, or 32 gigs of storage available to you.
[1179.18 → 1187.22] And the interesting thing to me about this was that this already exists, but for some reason, when Sony does it, it's making, you know, headlines.
[1187.70 → 1190.98] And when Patriot does it, we're the only ones who apparently know.
[1191.02 → 1193.30] We've actually got a sample of the Stellar already.
[1193.82 → 1198.26] So, if my internet would go a little bit faster here, I would be able to show that to you guys.
[1198.62 → 1203.54] But basically, it's pretty much the same thing, and it's available in up to 64 gigs.
[1203.54 → 1208.38] So, Patriot has the jump on Sony for that particular thing.
[1208.54 → 1213.84] Speaking of your internet not going fast enough, we might be getting some awesomeness on Tuesday.
[1214.22 → 1217.26] Or are we like, we are getting some awesomeness on Tuesday, or we might be?
[1217.26 → 1217.60] We are.
[1217.74 → 1218.22] We are.
[1218.30 → 1218.78] They're coming.
[1218.98 → 1220.04] We are getting some awesomeness on Tuesday.
[1220.04 → 1220.58] They're coming.
[1222.46 → 1226.54] I watched The Hobbit last night, so it's like...
[1227.62 → 1230.60] It's just total flashbacks.
[1230.72 → 1231.32] That was awesome.
[1231.48 → 1231.90] Thank you.
[1233.54 → 1234.86] Okay.
[1235.12 → 1237.58] So, anyway, were you going to tell them what's coming on Tuesday?
[1238.14 → 1240.62] Well, you know more about it than I do.
[1240.70 → 1243.54] Oh, well, basically, we have a new internet connection coming in.
[1243.60 → 1245.46] It's going to be 50 Meg down, which who cares?
[1245.46 → 1253.46] But compared to our 5 Meg up that we have now on cable, we are going to have 10 Meg up on fibre.
[1254.48 → 1260.04] And we're probably like the only people in the area on fibre, and I think the company that we're going through doesn't do shared connections.
[1260.40 → 1261.46] No, they don't.
[1261.46 → 1262.10] Don't.
[1263.72 → 1273.26] You should have seen who's on the phone, and he moves the phone away from his house, or house, head, and freaks out and falls to the floor and is all excited.
[1273.26 → 1275.40] And then all of a sudden goes like, yep, that sounds good.
[1275.40 → 1280.14] I didn't know it was a fibre connection.
[1280.28 → 1283.92] No, because that service is not fibre in every area.
[1284.34 → 1285.76] It just happens to be fibre here?
[1285.82 → 1289.16] Yes, because it's ADSL Plus in a lot of places.
[1289.72 → 1291.58] But they still have that service.
[1291.72 → 1294.54] But it's like, you know how it's always advertised max 10 Meg, but whatever?
[1294.82 → 1295.40] Yeah, yeah.
[1295.40 → 1296.32] Our area.
[1296.58 → 1301.80] Like, I called the general line, and they had to transfer me to, like, the fibre team in order to get it set up.
[1301.90 → 1303.16] Like, our area's fibre.
[1303.64 → 1304.40] That's awesome.
[1304.52 → 1305.82] So I'm, like, super stoked.
[1306.04 → 1308.16] I just made sure all your links were hyperlinked for the future.
[1308.44 → 1309.20] Oh, thank you.
[1309.20 → 1310.72] I appreciate that.
[1311.10 → 1313.84] If your internet was working, that would be fantastic.
[1313.84 → 1318.22] I am, like, super trying to do this, but I am, like, super not having a ton of success.
[1318.36 → 1321.06] And Patriot's SEO is super not terrific.
[1321.32 → 1326.46] So between all of those super things going on right now, there's not a lot I can do to show you guys the Stellar.
[1326.66 → 1327.52] Unless I can.
[1327.58 → 1328.28] There it is.
[1328.34 → 1328.58] Woo.
[1329.38 → 1329.58] Yay.
[1330.32 → 1331.02] Oh, really?
[1331.22 → 1331.46] Seriously?
[1331.58 → 1331.80] Oh, yeah.
[1331.84 → 1332.08] There we go.
[1332.10 → 1332.34] There we go.
[1332.40 → 1332.56] Okay.
[1332.64 → 1333.88] So this is the Stellar, you guys.
[1333.88 → 1342.88] So just like the Sony one, it's got a micro USB on one end, and then it has full-size USB 3, which is even better than the Sony one on the other end.
[1343.14 → 1347.28] Available in three different sizes, 16, 32, and 64, and is on-the-go ready.
[1347.46 → 1351.70] In fact, just as a quick test, I plugged it into the bottom of my one, and it worked flawlessly.
[1352.02 → 1358.18] They also have the Cosmos, which is not a USB thumb drive.
[1358.46 → 1359.26] It's different.
[1359.26 → 1360.26] It is a...
[1360.26 → 1362.66] Please have your sight work.
[1362.82 → 1363.28] Thank you.
[1363.28 → 1373.92] Cosmos, which is an on-the-go, so it has USB 2 on one end and micro USB on the other end, SD card and micro SD card reader.
[1374.20 → 1376.80] So this one's actually kind of cool because you're not just limited to the storage.
[1376.98 → 1378.00] It's limited to the storage.
[1378.08 → 1379.56] It's actually on the device itself.
[1379.62 → 1391.22] You could just carry around like a Pelican case full of SD cards, and then you could carry all the data with you if you were obsessive-compulsive enough to actually manage like transferring everything and like archiving it all on SD.
[1391.22 → 1393.22] So I thought that was pretty cool as well.
[1394.12 → 1394.52] All right.
[1394.64 → 1399.32] So let's see what the Twitter verse has to say about wearable smart bras.
[1399.64 → 1404.26] There's a bunch of people in the chat making fun of us for being all excited over an internet connection that is apparently not even that good.
[1404.58 → 1407.08] I know it's not that good, but this is Canada, guys.
[1407.12 → 1408.74] And it's like twice as good as our current one.
[1408.74 → 1412.76] Yeah, it's twice as good as the best plan we can get from our current providers.
[1412.96 → 1414.90] So whatever, man.
[1415.10 → 1415.88] Still stoked.
[1416.16 → 1416.38] Yeah.
[1416.50 → 1420.64] I mean, imagine if you can program the bra, as Dimitri here says.
[1420.80 → 1425.44] Imagine if you could program the bra like you can program GPS with like different voices.
[1425.44 → 1426.10] Your own voice.
[1426.32 → 1427.32] And like different attitudes.
[1427.48 → 1428.34] That's horrible.
[1428.34 → 1438.56] It's like, you know, that episode of Fukuyama where they reprogram the ship's computer from being like, you know, an irritating dude that Bender always argues with to being like a seductive female.
[1438.82 → 1443.12] So you could take your bra anywhere from like, you could dial it to like supportive girlfriend.
[1443.12 → 1445.82] And it's like, hey, hon, you know, you probably shouldn't grab that.
[1446.10 → 1448.38] And then you could dial it all the way to like abusive boyfriend.
[1448.38 → 1451.34] It's like, hey, if you eat one more of those, I'm leaving you.
[1452.04 → 1452.82] That's horrible.
[1452.96 → 1453.56] It's sort of horrible.
[1453.56 → 1456.50] See, it's just going to help anorexia, which is like not good.
[1456.62 → 1463.10] If it just tracked like your heart rate and like other things and gave you statistics so you could like to follow your thing.
[1463.16 → 1466.80] And like if it helped like health apps and all that kind of stuff like that could be really cool.
[1467.18 → 1467.54] Hater.
[1467.84 → 1469.12] Hater right here on the stream.
[1469.86 → 1471.06] Corbett's always a hater.
[1471.16 → 1471.46] I know.
[1471.54 → 1471.90] What a hater.
[1472.02 → 1473.24] Literally always a hater.
[1473.24 → 1474.88] We're getting, it's Telus Fibre.
[1475.02 → 1476.28] So I know it's Telus.
[1476.54 → 1478.80] So all the promises in the world.
[1479.24 → 1479.78] We'll see.
[1480.30 → 1481.02] But anyway.
[1481.02 → 1484.88] I bet Bill Gates put a camera in the bra.
[1484.98 → 1485.92] I bet he didn't.
[1486.00 → 1487.30] I bet he has better things to do.
[1488.32 → 1491.28] That would be a lot nicer than using weird on the go cables.
[1491.42 → 1491.82] Indeed.
[1492.62 → 1493.16] Wee Mini.
[1493.96 → 1494.18] What?
[1494.46 → 1495.94] I haven't even heard of this.
[1496.58 → 1497.40] No one has even taught.
[1497.64 → 1498.40] Hashtag boobies.
[1498.48 → 1498.62] Really?
[1498.68 → 1499.88] That was the best you could come up with?
[1503.16 → 1506.42] Apparently I am getting Justin through finals' week with this stream.
[1506.56 → 1507.80] It's like a chain, man.
[1507.80 → 1513.52] I am, I am, I don't think this stream will help you with your finals.
[1514.38 → 1518.02] Although if he has like scheduled breaks so that he can stay focused.
[1519.50 → 1522.92] Scheduled breaks at 4.30 on Fridays exactly for anywhere from one and a half to two and
[1522.92 → 1523.34] a half hours.
[1525.50 → 1526.64] I was so specific.
[1526.96 → 1527.16] All right.
[1527.24 → 1529.76] Oh, there's a better way to download SteamOS through the unofficial torrent.
[1529.86 → 1531.88] So guys, check that out as long as that is.
[1531.88 → 1531.90] Unofficial torrent.
[1531.90 → 1533.12] Yeah, whatever.
[1533.40 → 1535.20] But although it's on steamdb.info.
[1535.20 → 1536.38] Yeah, it's probably fine.
[1536.70 → 1540.08] Watching from work, I could feel the judgment from you just leaving the bra picture up.
[1540.12 → 1541.92] Yep, we are definitely judging that idea.
[1542.46 → 1545.78] How do you plan to prevent SteamOS spam in the Twitch chat?
[1546.10 → 1546.52] We're not.
[1546.66 → 1547.14] We're not.
[1547.20 → 1548.40] It seems to be fine already.
[1548.54 → 1548.76] Yep.
[1548.86 → 1552.32] I guess Windows and Steam will unite to provide the world the first game streaming bra.
[1553.78 → 1556.42] All right.
[1556.42 → 1560.28] So basically people don't have much to say about the smart bra, which I guess shouldn't
[1560.28 → 1561.02] surprise us that much.
[1561.10 → 1561.24] All right.
[1561.30 → 1562.12] So we've got our special.
[1562.12 → 1562.60] Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[1563.64 → 1564.34] Finally one.
[1564.42 → 1567.26] I believe MS said the smart bra would be for other purposes.
[1567.42 → 1570.18] Health apps are already a thing and more data could be useful for them.
[1570.36 → 1570.68] All right.
[1570.70 → 1573.04] So more data for the health apps that already exist.
[1573.16 → 1574.16] Okay, fine.
[1574.16 → 1579.46] But I mean, I just don't.
[1579.60 → 1580.84] The level of.
[1581.62 → 1583.16] Okay, I don't see it happening anytime soon.
[1583.58 → 1585.02] That part I do agree with though.
[1585.18 → 1585.38] Yep.
[1585.58 → 1589.72] If it interfaces your phone and helps currently existing health apps, that certainly makes
[1589.72 → 1589.96] sense.
[1590.44 → 1593.56] Yelling at you for eating too much, I don't think is the right angle.
[1594.28 → 1595.78] That doesn't seem like a good idea.
[1597.30 → 1599.22] You're probably just creating a problem.
[1599.30 → 1599.82] So terrible.
[1600.10 → 1600.22] Yeah.
[1600.34 → 1600.64] All right.
[1600.72 → 1603.54] So we have a special guest joining us.
[1603.54 → 1604.24] Do I have headphones?
[1604.42 → 1604.70] You do.
[1604.82 → 1605.48] They're over here.
[1605.54 → 1606.46] You are amazing.
[1607.12 → 1609.98] Slick set up the stream all by his big boy self today.
[1610.42 → 1614.84] And I am extremely impressed so far with how well it's working.
[1615.08 → 1617.92] Well, remember when you used to set it up and the audio never worked?
[1618.54 → 1621.12] Well, that's because we had the worst audio setup on the planet.
[1621.32 → 1622.52] I love our new audio setup.
[1622.64 → 1625.30] If I had enough time, it worked the best we ever had it working.
[1625.34 → 1625.88] It's so great.
[1626.10 → 1626.58] Just saying.
[1626.78 → 1627.30] Yeah, well.
[1627.38 → 1630.16] But this one's kind of nice because it just kind of works instantaneously.
[1630.30 → 1630.52] Yeah.
[1630.52 → 1633.50] You have to like to spend literally two hours trying to balance everything.
[1633.74 → 1634.28] Yeah, it's great.
[1634.42 → 1634.58] All right.
[1634.66 → 1635.12] I'm going to move.
[1635.50 → 1636.16] All right.
[1636.28 → 1637.78] User was moved to your channel.
[1637.94 → 1638.66] I hope he's ready.
[1640.08 → 1640.90] I am ready.
[1641.34 → 1642.36] Hey, how are you?
[1642.42 → 1643.54] Welcome to the show.
[1644.58 → 1645.38] I'm doing all right.
[1645.46 → 1646.58] Thanks for having me.
[1647.28 → 1649.00] This is absolutely fantastic.
[1649.20 → 1650.08] So, all right.
[1650.14 → 1650.76] I'm going to start.
[1650.88 → 1651.88] I'm actually, sorry.
[1652.02 → 1656.02] I know I just brought you in, but I actually have to not let you talk for just a moment here
[1656.02 → 1658.64] because not everyone would have necessarily seen the intro.
[1659.14 → 1663.54] So, guys, I'm introducing Anand from Anand tech right here.
[1663.64 → 1664.70] This is his head right here.
[1664.76 → 1668.86] You'll be hearing his melodic voice in your head, or at least you'll think it's melodic
[1668.86 → 1671.62] if you're anywhere near as much of a fanboy of this guy as I am.
[1671.62 → 1674.26] Now, I did an interview of him.
[1674.34 → 1677.40] I'm totally probably making you blush, so it's a good thing there's no video feed.
[1677.66 → 1683.48] But I did an interview of him at Computer that my staff hid the footage from me and wouldn't
[1683.48 → 1689.54] allow me to upload because apparently it was just about an hour of me gushing about his
[1689.54 → 1689.94] greatness.
[1690.60 → 1695.38] But now we're live, and so there's nothing that they can do to prevent this from being
[1695.38 → 1696.90] broadcast to the entire internet.
[1696.90 → 1702.20] So, Anand is the guy who got me into tech more than anyone else.
[1702.28 → 1705.88] I've read almost everything he's ever written, and I have a lot of respect for this guy.
[1706.28 → 1710.38] So, normally I ask my guests to introduce themselves, but I think I've probably introduced you a
[1710.38 → 1710.84] fair bit here.
[1710.86 → 1712.00] Do you have anything else to say?
[1713.28 → 1715.66] No, this is like super kind of you.
[1717.40 → 1719.20] So, no, I have nothing to add.
[1719.36 → 1720.20] This is awesome.
[1720.42 → 1721.52] And congratulations, by the way.
[1721.58 → 1726.86] You've been making waves and clearly putting in a lot of good work, and it's good to see
[1726.86 → 1728.62] that you get recognized for that.
[1729.06 → 1730.12] Well, thank you very much.
[1730.22 → 1733.82] I think that leads pretty well into our very first topic here.
[1733.94 → 1738.60] Now, you were, I mean, okay, I remember asking you this question, but I'm going to make you
[1738.60 → 1739.08] answer it.
[1739.10 → 1740.40] I'm going to make you answer it on air.
[1740.88 → 1746.14] You always wear a suit, even in Taipei, in the middle of summer.
[1746.14 → 1752.28] Can you talk about the origins of Nantes and a little bit about the print to digital media
[1752.28 → 1756.76] transition and how you've experienced it and lived through it?
[1757.84 → 1758.46] Yeah, totally.
[1758.84 → 1761.36] Okay, so the suit has a couple of things.
[1761.80 → 1764.62] So, I started, when I started the site, I was 14.
[1764.98 → 1770.64] And I don't know, my parents always raised me to believe that when you do something important,
[1770.74 → 1771.22] you wear a suit.
[1771.22 → 1775.58] So, I was, I don't know, meeting with people, and I figured, got to wear a suit.
[1776.42 → 1777.50] So, I did that for a while.
[1777.62 → 1779.88] And then, at some point, I guess I stopped being a kid.
[1780.06 → 1781.82] But I kept with the whole suit thing.
[1782.12 → 1788.28] Because one thing I realized was a lot of the other folks that were, you know, in the
[1788.28 → 1793.20] industry doing similar things weren't necessarily doing things as professionally as I thought
[1793.20 → 1794.66] that they should be doing them.
[1794.66 → 1800.64] So, I used the suit as kind of way to, at least when I walk in a room, to help explain
[1800.64 → 1801.82] that, look, we're here to work.
[1803.00 → 1805.52] I mean, since then, the, you know, industry's consolidated.
[1805.72 → 1806.86] Things have, like, calmed down a bit.
[1807.04 → 1808.80] But the suit always kind of stayed.
[1809.84 → 1811.48] Now, sometimes, I do slip up.
[1811.76 → 1816.48] Like, I mean, it went, I probably went like a decade without anyone ever seeing me outside
[1816.48 → 1817.06] of a suit.
[1817.14 → 1818.44] Because, like, that's not how I dress at home.
[1818.50 → 1819.78] Like, I'm not wearing a suit right now.
[1819.78 → 1826.46] So, I kept the facade going for, like, a really, really long time.
[1826.54 → 1831.40] And then, one time, I think I was speaking at maybe a Quake Con or something like that.
[1831.46 → 1834.18] And I remember getting out of a car.
[1834.58 → 1836.34] And I was, like, in basketball shorts.
[1836.34 → 1837.78] I hadn't shaved in days.
[1838.86 → 1841.08] And I think some people from AMD saw me.
[1841.16 → 1842.14] And they're like, what the hell is this?
[1842.76 → 1847.14] And so, since then, you know, I've kind of slacked a bit.
[1847.24 → 1849.56] Like, no, I won't wear, like, dress shoes anymore, right?
[1849.56 → 1850.22] I'll wear sneakers.
[1850.34 → 1852.00] Because, like, I don't know.
[1852.06 → 1853.22] I review really cool stuff.
[1853.28 → 1855.26] And it, like, blows my mind how they're able to do all of this.
[1855.32 → 1857.24] But my feet have to hurt at the end of a trade show.
[1857.30 → 1858.38] So, I'm not okay with that.
[1858.84 → 1860.82] So, I ditch the dress shoes.
[1861.06 → 1862.90] I'll usually wear the suit a few times.
[1863.00 → 1864.76] Like, I'm an old dude now, right?
[1864.80 → 1866.90] Like, I'll not wear a tie sometimes.
[1866.90 → 1868.16] And just, like, really slack off.
[1870.00 → 1870.32] Okay.
[1870.36 → 1871.58] So, that answers the suit question.
[1872.06 → 1873.00] Origins of a non-tech.
[1874.08 → 1876.38] Long story short, I was, like, I don't know.
[1876.44 → 1877.16] My parents are teachers.
[1877.26 → 1878.02] We didn't have a ton of money.
[1878.98 → 1880.68] I needed a new computer.
[1881.12 → 1882.50] My dad was like, hey, just build one.
[1882.58 → 1884.64] Because back then, you could save a lot of money doing that.
[1884.90 → 1885.12] Right.
[1885.46 → 1886.66] I had no idea what I was doing.
[1886.80 → 1889.56] So, I flipped through Computer Shopper, pointed at stuff.
[1889.84 → 1891.42] And, you know, we ordered things.
[1891.46 → 1892.10] And I put it together.
[1892.44 → 1894.96] And, of course, I shorted the motherboard to the chassis.
[1894.96 → 1896.06] So, I killed the motherboard.
[1896.16 → 1896.98] My dad's like, you're done.
[1896.98 → 1899.70] My mom's like, no, no, no.
[1899.70 → 1900.02] It's okay.
[1900.16 → 1901.30] We'll get you another motherboard.
[1901.82 → 1903.34] Totally, like, piece of crap motherboard, too.
[1903.40 → 1905.10] Had, like, fake cash on it, the whole thing.
[1906.22 → 1907.52] So, I built that.
[1907.70 → 1908.78] And I'm like, hey, this is kind of cool.
[1908.86 → 1909.44] I have a new computer.
[1909.44 → 1909.52] Sure.
[1909.94 → 1911.34] And I learned a lot in the process.
[1912.40 → 1915.28] My dad's a teacher at a college at the time.
[1915.72 → 1919.88] And other faculty and students were in a similar situation.
[1920.14 → 1922.96] So, this was, like, sevenths grade for me.
[1923.06 → 1924.34] He would, like, pick me up after school.
[1924.48 → 1926.08] And I'd go around and build people computers.
[1926.08 → 1929.18] And then, you know, they'd have problems with their computers.
[1929.26 → 1930.32] So, I'd go around and fix them.
[1930.80 → 1932.16] So, I did that for, like, two years.
[1932.34 → 1933.40] And then, 97 hit.
[1933.70 → 1937.28] And both my parents being teachers, I had this, like, bug to want to teach and share knowledge.
[1937.74 → 1939.58] So, I kind of brain-dumped online.
[1939.76 → 1940.66] And that's where we started.
[1942.08 → 1943.56] On a Geocities page, right?
[1944.02 → 1944.24] Yep.
[1944.70 → 1951.08] Geocities.com slash, I think, slash Silicon Valley slash Pine slash 9297.
[1951.34 → 1952.38] That was the URL.
[1953.54 → 1953.90] Nice.
[1954.58 → 1955.86] So, yeah, I did that.
[1956.08 → 1958.66] And, I don't know.
[1958.68 → 1959.06] I was 14.
[1959.18 → 1960.18] I didn't know what I was doing.
[1960.30 → 1962.16] I just wanted to share thoughts.
[1962.60 → 1965.74] And I hadn't really thought about the whole print to internet transition.
[1966.26 → 1971.74] And, actually, you know, I was doing it for years when, you know, print was still on this pedestal.
[1971.96 → 1975.92] And, you know, it was just you're the online guys, or you're the online guy that wears a suit.
[1977.46 → 1985.42] And, yeah, I mean, it took a while for that transition from print to digital to really become a holy crap, we need to do this.
[1985.42 → 1986.42] Kind of thing.
[1986.42 → 1997.30] And I would say that really probably happened in the past handful of years when, you know, you go through the past recession, you know, where everyone gets hit advertising-wise.
[1997.30 → 2000.40] And, you know, the print guys got hit the worst.
[2000.40 → 2001.04] Right.
[2001.04 → 2011.26] So, I think that's, you know, you could point to that point as, well, you know, you had better have jumped by now because otherwise you're going to have a difficult time or hope you have a lot of money.
[2011.26 → 2028.48] So, another question I had for you, you know, I guess so for you, the long and short of that is right place, right time as far as the brilliant idea of starting up a website in order to get your thoughts out there about PCs as opposed to trying to make a magazine or whatever else.
[2028.48 → 2031.82] Well, so I would add right place, right time, right age.
[2032.50 → 2038.16] Because one thing I do is I talk to, I go around and talk to, like, kids in high school.
[2038.26 → 2040.22] That was a very formulaic period of my life.
[2040.34 → 2049.50] And I had a unique high school career where, you know, I was in school, I was on TV, and, you know, I was also working with, you know, all these amazing companies and learning a lot.
[2049.50 → 2056.62] And one of the things that I like to tell kids is that, you know, those four years you have in high school, that's like a free ride, right?
[2056.66 → 2063.36] Like, you get your work done, but those are your four years to get your way towards, you know, your 10,000 hours, right?
[2063.42 → 2069.50] You pick a passion, you pick something that you don't need to make money with that you can just pour all your time into.
[2069.58 → 2072.26] You don't have to worry about, hopefully, like a rent or mortgage payment.
[2072.26 → 2083.74] You just dive into it and, you know, work towards being an expert at something so that when you step foot in college, you, you know, can go to learn and not necessarily go to hopefully one day start building a career.
[2084.30 → 2090.18] Right. That's actually a very, very good point and something I wish I had done a little bit better on my path.
[2090.26 → 2092.24] I did not get started nearly as early as you.
[2093.00 → 2097.84] So the basis of an on-tech at the beginning was, of course, PC.
[2097.84 → 2106.84] But over the last few years, I've seen, I've seen your interests shift and hence the articles that you're writing really shift towards things like home theatre.
[2107.04 → 2111.48] You went on a bit of a kick, a bit of a home theatre kick for a little while.
[2111.86 → 2121.22] You've moved away from PC strictly to doing a lot of first Mac coverage and then now iOS coverage.
[2121.32 → 2122.78] So Apple devices in general.
[2123.00 → 2125.40] And where do you see a non-tech heading in the future?
[2125.40 → 2133.88] I mean, you guys have, I mean, Brian Plug, if he's, if he's anywhere near you, please just yell at him and tell him how amazing he is when it comes to phone reviews.
[2133.88 → 2137.02] You guys have positioned yourselves through his hard work.
[2137.10 → 2142.06] I mean, sweat, blood and tears goes into that as really in my mind, the premier phone review site.
[2142.16 → 2143.54] But what do you think is the next step?
[2144.34 → 2145.28] I appreciate that.
[2145.34 → 2146.82] No, Brian isn't sitting next to me.
[2146.86 → 2149.96] He's, he's in Arizona right now working actually on another phone review.
[2149.96 → 2152.54] But he, he's amazing.
[2152.72 → 2155.22] Like I, I'm actually really, really proud of our entire team.
[2156.06 → 2160.58] So it's interesting if you look at it through, you kind of hit the nail on the head there.
[2160.64 → 2160.78] Yeah.
[2160.78 → 2161.00] Right.
[2161.02 → 2165.66] Like a lot of our coverage does, or at least what I do kind of follows my interests.
[2166.42 → 2167.94] You know, I was building a home theatre.
[2168.06 → 2170.32] So I said, Hey, maybe I should look in home theatre PCs.
[2170.32 → 2174.88] And I remember walking into a compiler class in college.
[2175.50 → 2177.88] This was back in 02 or 03.
[2178.46 → 2183.00] I remember walking in, in the I guess this was in the College of Engineering building,
[2183.34 → 2184.68] or maybe in the Computer Science building.
[2184.76 → 2187.42] So I walk in, and I look around and everyone has a Mac laptop.
[2187.54 → 2188.52] And I'm like, this is really weird.
[2189.32 → 2191.46] Because, you know, for years, you wouldn't see that.
[2192.00 → 2196.76] And that was actually what inspired me to go out, buy a Mac and start using that.
[2196.76 → 2199.82] And, and that spawned, you know, our, our Mac coverage.
[2200.98 → 2204.46] And then, you know, from there, you, you said it yourself, we, we branched out into mobile.
[2204.80 → 2208.74] What is interesting from my perspective is I don't actually view this as any different
[2208.74 → 2210.52] as what we, you know, did when I started.
[2210.64 → 2211.02] Right.
[2211.06 → 2217.54] Like it's all, we get into compute when it hits a, a certain level of sophistication.
[2217.64 → 2218.08] Right.
[2218.44 → 2218.88] Right.
[2219.48 → 2223.92] And, you know, we, our, our phone coverage kind of basically started with the iPhone back
[2223.92 → 2224.42] in 07.
[2224.42 → 2227.80] We, we had some false starts internally when we said, Hey, you know, how do we grow?
[2227.90 → 2229.22] We need other things to do.
[2230.12 → 2234.48] And, and, you know, we, we messed around with just kind of more regular phone reviews and,
[2234.86 → 2237.26] you know, playing around with PDAs and Windows Mobile and stuff like that.
[2237.26 → 2239.46] But none of those projects ever really got off the ground.
[2239.46 → 2244.04] And then, you know, we, we kind of tried again with the iPhone and that did relatively well.
[2244.62 → 2248.96] And then, you know, a couple of years into it, we, we started adding more.
[2248.96 → 2249.00] Sure.
[2249.44 → 2253.84] And then definitely over the past, I'd say three or four years, we really ramped up our
[2253.84 → 2254.48] mobile coverage.
[2255.14 → 2257.18] But from my perspective, they're all PCs, right?
[2257.20 → 2258.34] It's just a different box.
[2259.02 → 2261.60] And, you know, it's a different cadence of release, right?
[2261.60 → 2265.66] Because we do enterprise reviews as well, but that's just like a really, huge computer
[2265.66 → 2268.26] that comes out, you know, once every year or two.
[2268.26 → 2274.48] I mean, I think that's something that, that I think the post PC era is such a misnomer
[2274.48 → 2280.06] because the sitting at a desk doing work experience is not going to go away.
[2280.32 → 2284.08] I mean, this is much like a bit of a back and forth argument that I've had with my viewers
[2284.08 → 2288.80] over the last little while, where I said that the PS4 and the Xbox One are the last generation
[2288.80 → 2290.12] of consoles as we know them.
[2290.12 → 2293.40] And I'd have people telling me, well, what, I'm not going to game on my couch anymore?
[2293.52 → 2294.70] No, that's not what I'm saying.
[2294.70 → 2297.90] The couch gaming experience is not going anywhere.
[2298.14 → 2300.36] It's just that the console is going somewhere.
[2300.48 → 2305.86] So in much the same way that the sitting at a desk with a big monitor and getting real
[2305.86 → 2310.06] work done isn't going anywhere, I think the device that we do it on is the thing that
[2310.06 → 2312.00] might just be changing over the next five to 10 years.
[2312.40 → 2313.60] And it's just, they're all PCs.
[2314.60 → 2315.08] Just, yeah.
[2315.22 → 2318.56] And because that's, I mean, I would, I would say the same thing on a console, right?
[2318.56 → 2323.72] Like if you look at, you know, 360, PS3, PS4, Xbox One, it's just PCs.
[2323.72 → 2328.18] It's their like really weird PCs that are made by Microsoft and Sony, but they're just
[2328.18 → 2328.56] PCs.
[2329.84 → 2334.98] And you know, how, how well Valve does with Steam box over the next decade, I think we'll
[2334.98 → 2337.74] ultimately determine whether we get another console refresh.
[2338.00 → 2343.74] So let's talk about weird PCs with Steam box because that's our next topic.
[2344.36 → 2345.50] Very nice segue, by the way.
[2346.16 → 2350.94] Digital Storm has given some details on their upcoming Steam OS slash Windows.
[2350.94 → 2354.60] So they're planning to preload both OSes on it from what I've seen, but I guess you
[2354.60 → 2356.46] could probably opt out of Windows.
[2357.02 → 2361.78] So this is a gaming box with liquid cooling on the CPU up to a 700 watt power supply.
[2362.76 → 2367.36] It's going to be around $1,500, have a, have a powerful graphics card in it.
[2367.36 → 2374.06] Um, and then the other end of the spectrum, we've got guys like burrower with their $500
[2374.06 → 2379.02] machine that's going to have, I think it was an R, R9 270 or something along those lines,
[2379.10 → 2381.86] like a much more, uh, middle of the road graphics card.
[2382.26 → 2385.32] Where do you see Steam OS and Steam Box?
[2385.40 → 2389.88] Which to be clear for the viewers guys, a Steam Box is just a computer in much the same
[2389.88 → 2393.10] way that all the other things we're talking about are just computers that happens to run
[2393.10 → 2393.68] Steam OS.
[2393.96 → 2398.02] It's just, it's just a box that you bought from someone that is validated and preloaded
[2398.02 → 2398.56] with Steam OS.
[2398.68 → 2399.86] That's all the Steam Box is.
[2400.00 → 2404.44] So how do you see Steam Box fitting in with the current consoles and with PC moving forward?
[2406.00 → 2406.96] Um, okay.
[2407.06 → 2410.20] So, uh, it's a really, perfect idea.
[2410.64 → 2416.36] Um, it's actually, I was at a, uh, a dinner, um, uh, like a secret Intel Barrable dinner,
[2416.36 → 2419.12] which I guess I can talk about now because Barrable never happened for consumers.
[2419.12 → 2420.94] Um, so I was at this dinner.
[2420.94 → 2426.58] Is it okay, hold on a second, is it okay to reveal a secret that never truly fully got
[2426.58 → 2427.02] revealed?
[2427.96 → 2429.62] I mean, they, they announced it, right?
[2429.94 → 2433.70] It's just, I was never supposed to talk about this dinner, but I'm going to talk about the
[2433.70 → 2434.12] dinner now.
[2434.42 → 2434.74] All right.
[2435.48 → 2438.36] And, um, it's not actually, like, it's now I've hyped it up too much.
[2438.42 → 2441.38] The dinner, it doesn't, I mean, it was a great dinner, it's just, it's irrelevant to
[2441.38 → 2442.10] the current conversation.
[2442.34 → 2443.06] The food was good.
[2443.56 → 2446.04] Yeah, I know, it was actually, yeah, it was an entertaining dinner.
[2446.04 → 2449.86] Anyway, Charlie from SemiAccurate, he was, he was at the dinner, and he floats this idea
[2449.86 → 2453.40] of, um, and this is years ago, right?
[2453.40 → 2455.92] Like Barrable timeframe, like pre a lot of stuff.
[2456.36 → 2462.72] Um, so he floats this idea that, you know, AMD and Intel should get together, develop a
[2462.72 → 2468.24] list of specs and make, you know, develop a little badge program and make hardware vendors
[2468.24 → 2469.70] go out, meet the specs.
[2469.70 → 2473.88] And, you know, they can distribute like an OS, like a little virtualized or like a hypervisor
[2473.88 → 2474.68] or something like that.
[2475.02 → 2476.50] Um, like on a USB stick.
[2476.98 → 2483.40] Um, and this would be like a very custom console gaming OS that would, that would run on this
[2483.40 → 2483.90] hypervisor.
[2484.20 → 2487.50] Uh, and you'd have this logo program, which would ensure that you would meet the right
[2487.50 → 2488.90] specs and that you could play.
[2489.26 → 2490.28] Can I, can I interrupt you for a second?
[2490.38 → 2494.16] Do you want to just explain to the viewers who don't know what hypervisor is sort of what
[2494.16 → 2495.18] that would mean exactly?
[2495.80 → 2496.28] Oh, true.
[2496.38 → 2496.84] Yeah, sure.
[2496.84 → 2501.54] Um, basically a thing that you can run multiple virtualized OSes on.
[2501.86 → 2506.22] Um, so you, you would run, uh, so like if you have a Mac, how you can run windows on
[2506.22 → 2506.68] it, right?
[2506.72 → 2510.84] So like you'll, your VMware will be your hypervisor and then windows will be, you know, your,
[2510.84 → 2515.68] uh, uh, if you run windows alongside OS 10, like in OS 10 effectively.
[2516.16 → 2521.32] Um, but basically you look at it like this or actually the OS that, um, the Xbox One runs,
[2521.32 → 2521.62] right?
[2521.62 → 2526.92] So it has a hypervisor that runs the Xbox gaming OS as well as the, the Windows kernel
[2526.92 → 2527.78] side by side.
[2528.24 → 2530.56] Um, and you know, you switch between them anyway.
[2530.68 → 2533.58] So this is his idea and, and I heard it and like, this is amazing.
[2533.58 → 2539.50] This is exactly what we need to do because the console model of, Hey, you know, you got
[2539.50 → 2540.52] a certain amount of money.
[2540.52 → 2543.64] It has to go to the publisher or a certain amount of money has to go to, you know, you
[2543.64 → 2545.42] know, the, the owner of the platform.
[2545.66 → 2545.82] Yeah.
[2545.82 → 2546.66] Like that's all silly.
[2546.76 → 2550.12] Like there's no reason to have that anymore because we have the internet, and we have steam
[2550.12 → 2552.76] and you know, steam handles distribution for you.
[2553.08 → 2558.86] And at that time, if you looked at what was happening to PC gaming, I remember I walked
[2558.86 → 2562.56] into a best buy one day, and I was like, well, where are all the PC games?
[2562.56 → 2565.24] And it is like worried me, right?
[2565.32 → 2570.72] Because it was kind of, this started happening right before steam picked up a lot of steam,
[2570.94 → 2571.10] right?
[2571.16 → 2574.32] Like before it got really, perfect where, you know, you don't have to worry about PC
[2574.32 → 2574.86] gaming anymore.
[2575.32 → 2577.10] Um, and, and it was worrisome to me.
[2577.16 → 2579.18] So I heard this idea, and I'm like, this is amazing.
[2579.24 → 2581.84] This is the exact way to save PC gaming.
[2582.52 → 2586.26] Um, and it was a great idea, but, but you know, nothing ever came of it.
[2586.30 → 2589.10] And then, you know, Valve starts talking about steam OS and Steam box.
[2589.16 → 2590.08] And I'm like, oh, this is amazing.
[2590.08 → 2592.10] This is exactly what he was talking about years ago.
[2592.10 → 2593.70] And I believe in it.
[2593.78 → 2595.64] Um, I think it's a really, perfect idea.
[2595.84 → 2601.50] The, the wrinkle in all of this is, can you get killer titles ported over to Linux?
[2601.92 → 2605.20] Um, and the answer probably is yes.
[2605.54 → 2607.30] I'm going to argue it doesn't matter.
[2607.72 → 2611.46] That's, that's going to be, that's going to be sort of my, my take on all this, because
[2611.46 → 2617.30] if Valve can implement their streaming the way that they're saying that they can, like
[2617.30 → 2621.84] if I'm going to be able to stream 1080p or, you know, a couple of years from now when
[2621.84 → 2626.98] we're looking at 10 gigabit home networking over cat six being something that people can
[2626.98 → 2627.88] feasibly do.
[2627.88 → 2633.90] If all of a sudden we can stream 1080p or 4k from some other device within the house,
[2633.90 → 2637.58] whether that's a windows based gaming PC or whatever else it happens to be in the future,
[2637.58 → 2643.56] then I would make the argument that whether the game runs natively on Steam OS or not becomes
[2643.56 → 2644.00] irrelevant.
[2644.62 → 2651.60] And the, the Steam, the Steam box in its, in its best form to me is almost just a thin
[2651.60 → 2655.34] client that acts as a streaming box from whatever else happens to be in your house.
[2655.40 → 2660.48] I mean, for me, I think the first thing I thought when I heard about Nvidia grid was not, um,
[2660.48 → 2661.94] playing games over the internet.
[2661.94 → 2665.88] The first thing that I thought was, holy crap, I'd love to get one of those for like a land
[2665.88 → 2671.78] centre or for my house so that every PC in my house, whether it runs an Atom with onboard
[2671.78 → 2676.16] Intel graphics or whether it runs whatever other high-end stuff, you know, dual GTX Titans
[2676.16 → 2678.66] is able to have a fantastic gaming experience.
[2678.66 → 2681.06] So that, that's my take on it.
[2681.10 → 2682.98] And maybe like, let me know what you think.
[2683.18 → 2684.14] Do we, does it matter?
[2684.46 → 2686.06] Linux compatibility for the games.
[2686.06 → 2688.96] So you may bring up a perfect point.
[2689.08 → 2693.74] Um, but I, so I separate that from, cause at that point, then you don't need To Steam OS,
[2693.84 → 2693.98] right?
[2694.00 → 2696.62] All you need is like a, a, a sync, right?
[2696.62 → 2700.16] Like you just need a wireless sync for, you know, that connects to your TV.
[2700.16 → 2704.86] And I'm guessing, you know, Nvidia has already kind of done that with shield, and I'm guessing
[2704.86 → 2710.08] there'll be, uh, if you play in that space, you know, chances are you'll want to build a
[2710.08 → 2710.78] similar device.
[2710.78 → 2711.12] Right.
[2711.14 → 2715.42] So that's, that's kind of independent of, in my eyes of Steam OS being a success or not.
[2715.42 → 2716.82] Um, right.
[2716.82 → 2720.08] Cause like you can, you can build and deliver that experience today.
[2720.08 → 2720.48] Right.
[2720.50 → 2722.58] Like there's no, you don't need anything else.
[2722.84 → 2727.56] Um, what I'm, what I'm looking at Steam OS being successful at is can you duplicate the
[2727.56 → 2728.14] console model?
[2728.14 → 2728.38] Right.
[2728.38 → 2732.98] Can you get to the point where someone who knows, doesn't own a gaming PC, like he just
[2732.98 → 2735.90] runs like word on his notebook from 10 years ago.
[2736.42 → 2741.12] Um, can that guy or girl go out and say, Hey, I want this.
[2741.16 → 2741.78] I don't want an Xbox.
[2741.98 → 2742.60] I don't want a PlayStation.
[2742.88 → 2743.48] I want this.
[2743.54 → 2744.88] I don't, I don't know what PC gaming is.
[2744.88 → 2748.42] I don't know what Steam is, but this is what I want in my living room.
[2748.42 → 2749.62] Like, can they get to that point?
[2750.26 → 2755.00] Um, and, and, you know, if you, uh, you, you were at the Montreal thing, weren't you?
[2755.30 → 2755.74] Yeah, I was.
[2756.10 → 2756.42] Yeah.
[2756.50 → 2761.04] So if you listen to, uh, you know, all those guys up there, Carmack, Sweeney, the, you know,
[2761.04 → 2762.42] they all said, Hey, this is a crazy idea.
[2762.54 → 2763.24] Give it 10 years.
[2763.24 → 2764.44] And, and, you know, maybe it'll work.
[2764.92 → 2768.22] Um, if they can get to that ease of use model, right.
[2768.22 → 2773.30] I think it could definitely, definitely replace, uh, consoles.
[2773.56 → 2778.56] The issue though, is if we're talking about a 10-year horizon before this thing's successful,
[2778.56 → 2782.98] that, that does leave room for another, another go from the traditional console players.
[2782.98 → 2789.48] If they made it so that there was a, a version or a model or a type of Steam box that you
[2789.48 → 2796.48] could buy that was by default automatically launched into a big picture and just put you
[2796.48 → 2798.96] directly into big picture and did not really take you out.
[2799.08 → 2803.76] I think that could bridge that gap, but if it launched directly into Steam OS, it could
[2803.76 → 2805.74] be a little bit foreign because you're sitting on Linux, right?
[2805.74 → 2810.08] And the other thing that, the other thing that bothers me a little bit, um, from, from
[2810.08 → 2813.74] Val, like I understand why Val's doing this because they need to cater to the traditional
[2813.74 → 2814.64] PC gaming market.
[2814.64 → 2819.00] They can't, they can't tell those guys, yeah, Hey, I know you thought we were cool before,
[2819.00 → 2822.22] but we're going to be just, we're going to lock down Steam box hardware and there's going to
[2822.22 → 2823.56] be one hardware configuration.
[2823.56 → 2826.68] There's going to be a reference design, just like a traditional console.
[2826.68 → 2828.62] We're going to refresh it every three years or whatever else.
[2828.96 → 2834.38] Um, I don't think anyone would have accepted that, but the issue is that one of the major
[2834.38 → 2840.22] complaints that you get from a diehard console player is I don't want to upgrade my hardware
[2840.22 → 2841.84] every year or every two years.
[2841.84 → 2847.26] And I don't want to worry about GTX this or Radeon that that happens to be on the box.
[2847.26 → 2850.78] I want to, or inside the box, I want to go to Best Buy.
[2850.78 → 2853.72] I want to buy the thing with the price tag under it.
[2853.72 → 2854.72] There's one price tag.
[2854.72 → 2855.72] There's one thing I want to take it home.
[2855.72 → 2859.58] I want to put my game in it and I want to have the experience that all my buddies are having.
[2859.58 → 2865.76] Whereas I think opening up the hardware to just anything, um, is not the strategy that
[2865.76 → 2871.26] we've seen work so well for companies like Microsoft with the Xbox or like Apple with
[2871.26 → 2875.46] the iPhone and the iPad, where it's this tightly integrated experience that they're managing.
[2875.46 → 2881.32] I mean, something that Apple does so well is no iPhone will ever ship with a crappy wireless
[2881.32 → 2883.32] chipset from some no name.
[2883.32 → 2889.50] Whereas it will be possible for people to buy a Steam box with off brand audio components
[2889.50 → 2895.26] or wireless components and have a bad experience and blame it on Steam OS or on Steam box rather
[2895.26 → 2897.66] than on the true, the true culprit.
[2897.66 → 2900.76] And I think that by trying to target a less tech-savvy audience, you open yourself up to
[2900.76 → 2901.76] that.
[2901.76 → 2903.96] So I, I'd agree with that.
[2903.96 → 2906.76] But I would say that those are like, that's something you can easily mitigate.
[2906.76 → 2911.82] So Microsoft tries to do this with the Windows hardware approval process.
[2911.82 → 2916.58] It's just that they set the bar so low that everyone can play.
[2916.58 → 2917.58] I mean, they have to write though.
[2917.58 → 2920.94] I know we need to sell windows because otherwise we can't, we need windows.
[2920.94 → 2924.76] Um, whereas valve isn't in that position, right?
[2924.76 → 2927.58] So if I'm at valve, you know, you just go hardcore about it, right?
[2927.58 → 2931.88] We'll give you, you know, you want this official steam box logo or whatever.
[2931.88 → 2934.94] You have to not ship like just terrible hardware.
[2934.94 → 2938.58] Um, so I, I think that's, that's something that you can get around.
[2938.58 → 2944.34] Um, you know, big picture mode, it's, I actually wrote about this in our G-Sync coverage that
[2944.34 → 2951.70] it seems like there are a lot of individual projects, um, that are out in, in the PC gaming
[2951.70 → 2952.62] world right now.
[2952.62 → 2960.08] Uh, that if we just polished them all up, we would be, we'd be very close to like a hyper
[2960.08 → 2961.02] console experience.
[2961.02 → 2961.34] Right.
[2961.34 → 2964.80] So something that's even, you know, it used to be that, Hey, consoles, they were simple.
[2964.80 → 2968.72] You didn't need to worry about installing your game and updates and none of that.
[2968.72 → 2971.18] But like now cartridges, no loading screens.
[2971.98 → 2972.30] No.
[2972.42 → 2976.40] And now it's like, well, you got to put in the disc and like wait three and a half minutes
[2976.40 → 2977.64] because it has to install.
[2977.76 → 2978.74] And like, there's a disc.
[2978.94 → 2981.64] So like now it's a it's a very, yeah.
[2981.80 → 2986.72] And it's not all the whole premise of this being an easy to use different thing.
[2986.76 → 2988.04] Like it has a web browser now.
[2988.04 → 2990.72] It's just, it's no longer what a console used to be.
[2990.80 → 2992.28] It's just a managed PC now.
[2992.78 → 2996.38] Um, so I feel like if you look at, you look at G-Force experience, right?
[2996.46 → 2996.62] Yeah.
[2996.88 → 3001.80] That's, that's a way of abstracting the whole, you have to define settings, um, which works,
[3001.80 → 3002.16] right?
[3002.28 → 3006.22] You look at Steam's big picture mode that gets away from, you know, there's a window desktop
[3006.22 → 3007.66] and Windows desktop in the background.
[3008.10 → 3012.86] Um, and then you look at technologies like G-Sync, and now you're getting into this realm of,
[3012.96 → 3018.02] well, not only does it look better, have cheaper games and, you know, whatever it is,
[3018.04 → 3021.62] compared to a console, but like, it's actually also smoother too, right?
[3021.68 → 3024.06] Like this is like, this is, it's, it's insane.
[3024.16 → 3027.46] So we have all of these like little things, but all of them need polish, right?
[3027.50 → 3032.30] Cause big picture mode is close, but it's still kind of valve-y, you know?
[3032.30 → 3033.22] Not quite there.
[3033.56 → 3037.76] And G-Sync is locked down to Nvidia hardware and mantle.
[3038.24 → 3042.10] I mean, they're saying it's not locked down, but I think it'll be a cold day in hell before
[3042.10 → 3045.64] Nvidia, um, gets on board with project mantle.
[3045.64 → 3048.80] And so all these things, it's just like you're saying, they need to all kind of come together.
[3049.20 → 3052.80] Um, but this, this segues really well into our next topic, which is G-Sync.
[3052.90 → 3055.86] Now I've got a G-Sync monitor here as well, the same one you have.
[3056.30 → 3060.34] Um, so I've played with it myself, but I read almost everything you write, regardless of
[3060.34 → 3063.48] whether I've already got one, and I've already got my own impressions of it formed as well
[3063.48 → 3063.78] anyway.
[3063.78 → 3068.88] So I did notice that you were the one who did the G-Sync article for your website.
[3069.42 → 3073.60] Um, you did, I guess you were, was it because you were particularly excited about it or,
[3073.60 → 3077.08] um, you know, did you just want to make sure that it was done a hundred percent right?
[3077.14 → 3078.04] The article was great.
[3078.12 → 3083.38] Give me your, your thoughts in, I guess, verbal form, as opposed to asking everyone to necessarily
[3083.38 → 3085.00] read the article, although they definitely should.
[3085.04 → 3086.10] It's only about four pages.
[3086.10 → 3090.76] How important is G-Sync for the future of PC gaming and just for the future of better
[3090.76 → 3092.00] image quality in general?
[3093.08 → 3093.44] Yeah.
[3093.58 → 3095.44] So, um, I, I don't know.
[3095.52 → 3098.28] I did, it's no, there's no like big story as to why I was the one that wrote it.
[3098.38 → 3100.74] NVIDIA was like, Hey, we're sending you a monitor.
[3100.98 → 3102.50] I was like, Hey, yeah, I'm busy.
[3102.54 → 3103.42] I have like stuff to do.
[3103.50 → 3105.90] And no, I know you have to, it doesn't, I don't care.
[3106.00 → 3107.30] Just, just take the monitor.
[3108.98 → 3113.46] So, so yeah, that, that was the, the long story of that.
[3113.46 → 3116.64] Um, so what do I think of G-Sync?
[3116.82 → 3120.98] Um, I was kind of expecting it to just like completely like just suck.
[3121.08 → 3121.44] Right.
[3121.50 → 3126.90] Because I saw it in Montreal and I, you, you saw it there and like what they showed was impressive.
[3126.90 → 3127.26] Right.
[3127.28 → 3128.88] Like I looked at it, and I'm like, this is good.
[3129.22 → 3133.86] Um, but they showed it in the pendulum demo and like, I couldn't really play with it.
[3134.08 → 3134.32] Yeah.
[3134.52 → 3140.76] And Tomb Raider in that one spot where you stood next to that one mountain, and you panned around
[3140.76 → 3142.74] the character at two different speeds.
[3142.74 → 3144.12] I was just like, come on guys.
[3145.18 → 3145.54] Exactly.
[3145.68 → 3149.24] I'm like, come on, this is not, so I'm fully expecting it to just be miserable.
[3149.64 → 3153.30] And for like the first day, day and a half, that's, that was my experience.
[3153.56 → 3155.76] Um, I, I kind of mentioned it in the review.
[3156.22 → 3156.38] Yeah.
[3156.40 → 3162.02] Uh, I had this, um, this Titan system, uh, the, the Tiki from Falcon Northwest that, that,
[3162.10 → 3166.76] you know, I got when the Titan launched and dude, like the thing was just like hard lock.
[3166.76 → 3172.72] Um, whenever just, I did anything and when I could get it to be stable, like I totally
[3172.72 → 3176.78] wiped the machine, did a brand new installation Windows 8.1 latest drivers, whatever.
[3177.26 → 3182.34] Uh, and, and whenever I'm just even running benchmarks, when I could get them to run on this Titan,
[3182.34 → 3185.60] they were running like slower than the, the GTX seven 60.
[3186.18 → 3191.44] So I, at first, and, and, you know, I, I have, um, Dell's, uh, 24 inch 4k here.
[3191.54 → 3195.38] So I switch monitors and switch the monitors and every, all the problems go away.
[3195.40 → 3195.94] Everything's fine.
[3195.94 → 3198.64] So at first I thought, well, this, this thing sucks.
[3198.96 → 3205.84] Um, and then I had a, uh, GTX six 60 Ti, uh, on a different test bed, plug it in.
[3205.94 → 3209.58] The thing won't even like post, like I don't even, there's no nothing out of the display.
[3209.98 → 3211.72] So I'm like, okay, this is really, terrible.
[3211.96 → 3214.28] Um, and then, you know, a third time's the charm.
[3214.40 → 3218.86] I had a, a GTX seven 60 from VGA and, uh, worked perfectly.
[3219.58 → 3225.00] So, uh, when I got to that point, I was really, really worried, but no, it, it literally
[3225.00 → 3225.68] worked at everything.
[3225.68 → 3226.70] Like there were no issues.
[3226.70 → 3232.76] I never ran into, uh, any like weird hiccups or visual glitches or anything like that.
[3233.02 → 3238.20] Um, it all worked, and it worked and looked just as good as it did in Montreal, which was
[3238.20 → 3238.76] kind of amazing.
[3239.34 → 3245.22] Um, it was frustrating to me that the pendulum demo doesn't let you, it doesn't deal with
[3245.22 → 3248.72] any scenario greater than 60 frames a second.
[3248.72 → 3251.66] Like I can't do any of the 120 or 144 testing there.
[3251.86 → 3254.98] Um, that was kind of frustrating, but I spent a lot of time playing games.
[3255.00 → 3257.22] Um, which, um, I don't get time to do anymore.
[3257.46 → 3258.88] Um, so that was kind of cool.
[3259.30 → 3263.80] Um, and I don't know, I posted some videos that kind of show the effect.
[3263.80 → 3266.84] Uh, it, it, you know, makes me hate tearing a lot.
[3266.84 → 3273.16] Um, and, uh, yeah, I thought there was a there was a substantial benefit to, to using this
[3273.16 → 3280.30] versus V sync on, um, obviously a substantial benefit versus, uh, you know, V sync off less
[3280.30 → 3284.76] pronounced of a benefit versus V sync off at a really high refresh rate.
[3284.76 → 3290.20] Um, which I think that's, uh, that's a key thing for, you know, any hardcore gamers right
[3290.20 → 3292.46] now that are already running at 144 or 120.
[3292.86 → 3294.50] Um, there's still an advantage.
[3294.50 → 3298.42] It's just not nearly as pronounced as it is at 60.
[3298.80 → 3302.14] Well, to me, to me, the issue here, sorry, do you, do you mind?
[3302.70 → 3303.52] No, no, go for it.
[3303.52 → 3303.68] Okay.
[3303.94 → 3307.04] To me, the issue here are a couple of things.
[3307.08 → 3312.48] So number one is that Nvidia shipped their G sync evaluation monitor.
[3312.48 → 3318.16] Um, and it's a one, it's a 1080p panel and it's a 144 Hertz panel.
[3318.16 → 3321.58] And I, I don't find it much the same way that you didn't see as much of a difference there.
[3321.62 → 3326.80] I don't find that at extremely high refresh rates, it is as huge and night and day of a
[3326.80 → 3329.96] difference as it is at, you know, 60 frames per second.
[3330.06 → 3331.10] And Nvidia knows that.
[3331.44 → 3336.78] And the number two is that because it's only a 1080p monitor in modern games with a decent
[3336.78 → 3342.44] graphics card, because the, the, the, the pace at which graphics cards have been improving
[3342.44 → 3345.44] in performance has really begun to slow down.
[3345.60 → 3351.10] Even, you know, a last generation card, like a 660 Ti can run most modern games and not really
[3351.10 → 3355.54] worry too much at dipping below 60 frames per second, unless you're cranking up details
[3355.54 → 3360.16] that begin to not really affect image quality, unless you're doing side by side screenshot
[3360.16 → 3364.66] comparisons and, and, and peering at them with a magnifying glass.
[3364.66 → 3371.36] Um, so to me that the issue is that they shipped completely the wrong product to showcase it.
[3371.36 → 3378.16] And I think that if they had shipped a 1440 P panel, so something that can actually, um,
[3378.38 → 3382.78] if there's something that runs at a resolution where it's going to demand more of a GTX seven
[3382.78 → 3387.80] 80 or a GTX Titan than it can provide and dip below 60 frames per second, once in a while.
[3387.88 → 3392.12] And if they had stuck with a 60 Hertz monitor, I think it would have made for a much more impressive
[3392.12 → 3393.06] first experience.
[3393.06 → 3395.62] So yeah, I'd, I'd agree with that.
[3395.68 → 3397.86] I mean, one, I'm just not a fan of this panel.
[3397.86 → 3400.18] Like it's just not a like it's okay on games.
[3400.30 → 3403.80] It's just not a, I mean, and part of it, it's, it's a cheaper display, right?
[3404.06 → 3408.14] Um, well, it's not, but well, yeah, I know, but it's not like a, you know, it's not like
[3408.14 → 3409.40] a $600 display, right?
[3409.48 → 3410.74] Or a thousand dollar display.
[3411.34 → 3415.68] Um, so, and, and again, for games, like whatever you get lost in it, it's fine.
[3415.68 → 3419.12] Um, so I, I wasn't a huge fan of the display they chose.
[3419.12 → 3423.36] My guess is it was probably one of the easiest to kind of retrofit.
[3423.76 → 3428.10] Um, and even if you, I actually, I want to take apart one of the ones that isn't a G-Sync
[3428.10 → 3428.48] monitor.
[3428.48 → 3432.80] Because I don't know if you saw on the inside of it, it's got an Nvidia branded PCB.
[3432.80 → 3434.36] Yeah, I did see that.
[3434.36 → 3435.98] Uh, so I don't know.
[3436.24 → 3439.16] Cause like they, you know, the whole thing is, well, we just replaced the scaler.
[3439.44 → 3444.42] Um, but at least in this display, they replaced, like, it looks like they replaced just, there's
[3444.42 → 3448.54] this entire PCB that they've changed, but I don't know if the original also was designed
[3448.54 → 3449.02] by Nvidia.
[3449.02 → 3450.40] So that, that's something I'm curious about.
[3450.62 → 3453.06] So I had the same conversation with them.
[3453.06 → 3453.34] Sorry.
[3453.64 → 3454.36] Uh, hold that thought.
[3454.38 → 3458.32] I had the same conversation with them on the phone where I actually, because I've had a
[3458.32 → 3462.54] lot of people asking me, Linus, are we going to be able to mod our existing
[3462.54 → 3465.56] monitors and add G-Sync functionality to them after the fact?
[3465.56 → 3474.24] And what Tom said was, um, well, I, I, I guess you could, but you would basically be soldering
[3474.24 → 3480.22] and like building a connector harness out of the interface for the panel itself and then
[3480.22 → 3484.58] connecting the, the, the, the G-Sync hardware that's inside your existing monitor.
[3484.58 → 3487.86] And like, you'd be, you'd be doing this weird Frankenstein thing.
[3487.86 → 3493.56] But when, when I opened it up, it looked aside from just lining up the wires here and making
[3493.56 → 3498.46] sure that you don't have any, anything crossed and anything configured incorrectly, it looked
[3498.46 → 3499.18] very possible.
[3500.58 → 3501.02] Yeah.
[3501.14 → 3504.60] So that's why I'm curious to see what like a normal one of these monitors looks like on
[3504.60 → 3505.02] the inside.
[3505.02 → 3506.26] Because I don't know about yours.
[3506.38 → 3510.96] Mine was like the all the hardware, um, the scalar board and the Nvidia like motherboard
[3510.96 → 3511.84] that it plugged into.
[3511.84 → 3513.98] That was all just like taped in place.
[3514.30 → 3514.44] Yes.
[3514.56 → 3516.48] There were no screws.
[3516.74 → 3517.94] It was just tape.
[3518.72 → 3524.78] And so I, I don't, I, I'm just really curious to see what the, the unmodified Asus display
[3524.78 → 3525.30] looks like.
[3525.80 → 3530.20] Um, so yeah, no, I mean, for, for folks who haven't seen it before, right?
[3530.20 → 3534.64] Like the sweet spot for G-Sync is somewhere in that, you know, for me, I found it to be like
[3534.64 → 3537.16] 38 to 60 frames a second.
[3537.16 → 3543.84] Um, whereas normally when you're running V-Sync on, on a 60 Hertz panel, you start dropping
[3543.84 → 3547.96] below in that range and start getting like this really, really variable frame rate, um,
[3547.96 → 3549.68] that's out of sync with, with your monitor.
[3549.82 → 3551.36] You do get this judder, right?
[3551.36 → 3554.68] Like it's, it's clear that, you know, whatever you've walked into a room where there's just
[3554.68 → 3557.08] like really detailed paintings on the wall and stuff.
[3557.08 → 3557.32] Right.
[3557.32 → 3559.14] Or like there's just tons of foliage outside.
[3559.44 → 3561.70] Um, and you get this judder and you just kind of deal with it.
[3561.70 → 3567.00] And then with G-Sync in that exact same situation, it kind of feels like 60 frames a second.
[3567.16 → 3568.84] Um, it kind of does, actually.
[3568.84 → 3570.28] It was, I mean, you tried it, right?
[3570.28 → 3571.42] Yeah, no, it feels perfect.
[3571.78 → 3572.64] It feels perfect.
[3572.78 → 3572.98] Yeah.
[3573.58 → 3575.38] That's not the kind of show we're running here, man.
[3576.04 → 3576.58] Yeah, no.
[3576.72 → 3578.34] That's what I thought I was calling into.
[3578.58 → 3578.90] I don't know.
[3578.90 → 3580.60] We just talked about a bunch of really boring stuff.
[3581.70 → 3582.96] He said he wasn't in a suit.
[3583.00 → 3584.12] He's ready in his PJs.
[3584.24 → 3585.16] Like he's in his, yeah.
[3585.16 → 3587.30] It's like, what are you wearing over there?
[3587.84 → 3589.96] Dude, the suit is like long gone, man.
[3592.16 → 3594.74] I just got back from a trip, man.
[3594.80 → 3595.96] That thing's, it's done.
[3595.96 → 3596.60] It's done.
[3597.04 → 3599.90] Um, no, so I agree.
[3600.02 → 3602.34] Like they, they picked a an interesting panel.
[3602.68 → 3607.20] Um, I, you know, I was able to find a bunch of games where even on a 760, you know, dropping
[3607.20 → 3608.60] below 60 wasn't an issue.
[3608.92 → 3613.54] Um, but what I found is just the experience is terrible if you drop below 30, like it's
[3613.54 → 3614.68] just, it gets real bad.
[3614.68 → 3619.38] Um, so you, you really need fast enough to be above 30.
[3620.02 → 3625.06] Uh, but you know, you need the optimal combination of, of settings and hardware to make sure you're
[3625.06 → 3627.02] always in that sweet spot for this to do anything.
[3627.02 → 3627.36] Right.
[3627.36 → 3628.48] You know, what's funny?
[3628.48 → 3629.80] Uh, sorry, go, go ahead.
[3629.86 → 3630.52] You can finish that thought.
[3630.58 → 3634.74] But I just, I have another thing to add to the V-Sync on versus G-Sync scenario.
[3635.44 → 3635.64] Okay.
[3635.72 → 3635.86] Yeah.
[3635.86 → 3639.64] And I'm always going to say is this actually, um, what Carmack said, I think he was the one
[3639.64 → 3643.70] that said it on stage resonates really well with me now in that, uh, game developers
[3643.70 → 3645.76] no longer have to target 60, right?
[3645.76 → 3650.12] Like they can, they can be okay dipping down to some of these lower, oh, and that's assuming
[3650.12 → 3653.66] that this is something that's, you know, supported by more than just NVIDIA.
[3653.90 → 3658.60] But I, I think that's where a lot of the potential is that, and it's a good way of dealing with
[3658.60 → 3663.88] the stupidly high resolution displays, which formerly, you know, you needed to have basically
[3663.88 → 3668.28] whatever the most expensive buy Jensen and new Ferrari kind of, or Königsberg kind of cards
[3668.28 → 3668.54] were.
[3668.54 → 3676.36] So my whole thing on the V-Sync versus G-Sync is I agree with you completely that it helps
[3676.36 → 3678.58] with the, the stutter, which it does.
[3678.62 → 3679.12] And that's great.
[3679.14 → 3679.86] And it's fantastic.
[3680.02 → 3685.06] But for me, my biggest problem with V-Sync isn't really stutter because I tend to run
[3685.06 → 3686.00] very high-end hardware.
[3686.00 → 3692.26] So even from a high-end gamer perspective, something I think NVIDIA isn't talking about enough,
[3692.62 → 3694.90] maybe because they don't know how to quantify it.
[3694.90 → 3699.34] And maybe because such a small subset of their customers will even be able to relate to it
[3699.34 → 3701.10] because it'll only be the high-end guys.
[3701.44 → 3705.38] But to me, my big problem with V-Sync has always been input lag.
[3705.74 → 3712.12] I can feel it, particularly in some game engines where Left 4 Dead was the first game, I think,
[3712.34 → 3717.22] where it really drove me absolutely bananas to have to choose between the terrible tearing
[3717.22 → 3723.18] in that game and the terrible input lag that for whatever reason is present in that particular
[3723.18 → 3724.78] source-based game.
[3725.66 → 3729.80] And I just couldn't play with V-Sync on because the delay was so substantial.
[3730.34 → 3732.92] G-Sync means the lag goes away.
[3733.32 → 3738.76] And NVIDIA doesn't seem to be talking about that in the right way.
[3738.86 → 3740.08] Do you see that as a major benefit?
[3740.32 → 3741.94] And are they missing the boat here?
[3742.88 → 3744.14] No, so I agree with you.
[3744.18 → 3747.28] That's something actually I wish I had more time to deal with.
[3747.28 → 3754.42] So I was at some other meetings when the G-Sync monitor arrived.
[3754.56 → 3757.72] And I got back basically, I don't know, Sunday morning.
[3758.34 → 3761.96] And then I killed the first day and a half trying to figure out what was wrong with the
[3761.96 → 3762.20] thing.
[3762.32 → 3765.40] And then that left me with basically two days to deal with all of this.
[3765.44 → 3767.58] So I didn't get to go in-depth into input lag.
[3768.12 → 3769.94] But I know that's a big component.
[3769.94 → 3775.32] I think it's a question of which end do you attack, right?
[3775.36 → 3780.24] I think the cell they have here with the, hey, this makes everything smoother bit, I
[3780.24 → 3784.28] think that's a very experiential cell that applies to a very wide audience or a very broad
[3784.28 → 3784.70] audience.
[3786.04 → 3791.22] And I think a lot of what NVIDIA has been doing has been trying to go after that, almost
[3791.22 → 3792.36] the console gamer, right?
[3792.36 → 3797.48] The person who doesn't really know or understand what's going on, and they're not playing competitively.
[3797.48 → 3802.80] But, you know, they're going after that market.
[3803.12 → 3807.90] And I think, you know, reducing input lag is a definite advantage.
[3808.34 → 3813.26] But I think, like you said, that tailors to a slightly smaller niche.
[3814.04 → 3814.14] Right.
[3814.88 → 3819.62] One thing, one analogy I like using for G-Sync, actually, and like it's not perfect because
[3819.62 → 3824.76] Project Butter introduced V-Sync to Android or that like it used V-Sync.
[3824.76 → 3829.52] So it's not perfect, but what Project Butter did for the Android side of things, I see
[3829.52 → 3834.94] G-Sync doing for the PC side of things because beforehand there was all these drawbacks and
[3834.94 → 3838.64] different things you could have to make it faster, but then it would look kind of gross.
[3838.98 → 3841.22] It was just, it was never very smooth and it was never perfect.
[3841.38 → 3844.24] And Project Butter just launched them forward in that direction.
[3844.28 → 3844.40] Yeah.
[3844.46 → 3849.54] Because it was almost this intangible, wow, my phone just feels, well, like butter.
[3849.54 → 3852.02] And I mean, G-Sync is, it's, yeah.
[3852.46 → 3852.70] Yeah.
[3853.24 → 3854.02] Butter for the PC.
[3854.32 → 3857.98] So you can't, you can't actually really use it because, because Project Butter brought
[3857.98 → 3860.74] in V-Sync, but I still like using it because of the general idea.
[3863.40 → 3867.02] So next topic is Haswell E.
[3867.02 → 3873.76] Now, this particular, this particular site that has the, the Haswell E leaked specs, they've
[3873.76 → 3877.94] been known to be right once in a while and not necessarily right all the time.
[3878.62 → 3880.34] So it's anantech.com.
[3880.42 → 3881.60] We're going to head over, no, I'm just kidding.
[3882.04 → 3887.76] So this is, this is actually posted by Digital Nav on our forum.
[3887.76 → 3895.90] Um, and the original article is from WCCF Tech, but have you had a look at the sort of these
[3895.90 → 3902.28] leaked, um, rumoured specs, and what are your thoughts on Haswell E versus what we have now,
[3902.42 → 3904.00] which is Ivy Bridge E?
[3904.18 → 3905.76] Do we need 8 core on the desktop?
[3906.16 → 3907.06] How important is this even?
[3908.32 → 3911.94] Um, so yeah, I, I actually, I didn't realize this, this had leaked yet.
[3912.12 → 3916.56] Um, so I, I don't, I didn't pay much attention to, you know, how accurate, interaccurate it was.
[3916.56 → 3923.46] Um, they actually had, uh, Haswell E running in IDF, um, at IDF last year or, oh crap, this
[3923.46 → 3923.88] year still.
[3924.42 → 3927.24] Um, they had it running just as a DDR4 demo.
[3927.56 → 3930.94] Um, so, so samples have been out there, so I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, people
[3930.94 → 3931.74] got wind of it.
[3932.34 → 3935.62] Um, how important is this going to be?
[3935.84 → 3941.96] I, the, the, the whole, you know, Sandy Bridge E, Ivy Bridge E and looking at Haswell E,
[3942.06 → 3944.50] that's just a really weird family of parts to me.
[3944.50 → 3948.68] What I, what I want is something in between the two that I don't have to use like a weird
[3948.68 → 3950.06] socket to get to.
[3950.58 → 3951.32] Um, right.
[3952.24 → 3956.10] And I think we might get that with, you know, it sounds like they're going to do pocketed
[3956.10 → 3961.14] Bradwell and, and bring Crystal Well on board, but I'm guessing they won't, you know, they
[3961.14 → 3962.40] won't improve Crystal Well at all.
[3962.46 → 3964.00] It'll still be the same thing we have today.
[3964.24 → 3967.84] Um, but I, I, I don't know that I'm more interested in that personally.
[3967.84 → 3970.22] Um, do we need eight cores on the desktop?
[3970.42 → 3970.56] Yeah.
[3970.56 → 3975.16] If you're doing like a lot of like really, really heavy professional video work, I can
[3975.16 → 3976.40] see that being very, very exciting.
[3976.96 → 3982.54] Um, and, and, you know, I'd be fine with it if it weren't out of sync with the rest of
[3982.54 → 3983.50] the desktop stuff.
[3983.62 → 3983.98] Right.
[3984.02 → 3987.82] I don't like this whole, yeah, you can get something that's, you know, a little better,
[3987.82 → 3990.80] but it's a year out of phase with everything else.
[3990.80 → 3993.58] Like I don't, you've got smart response here.
[3993.74 → 3998.28] You've got, you know, you've got quick sync here, but you've got more cores there and more
[3998.28 → 3998.70] RAM there.
[3998.78 → 4003.44] This fragmentation or the segmentation or whatever you want to call it, um, really bothers me.
[4003.48 → 4005.98] And I guess that's pretty much what you're alluding to right now.
[4006.82 → 4009.00] Yeah, I don't, I don't, I'm just not a fan of it.
[4009.00 → 4011.90] Like it's, it's, uh, you know, it is what it is.
[4011.90 → 4015.64] Like you can't, it's, I mean, cause this is effectively a server part, and they're just kind
[4015.64 → 4018.46] of making a, a desktop version of it.
[4018.46 → 4020.70] Um, so it's, it's nice.
[4020.74 → 4023.22] Like it'll obviously it'll improve over Ivy Bridge.
[4023.56 → 4028.18] Um, you know, we already know what Haswell can do in terms of a per core IPC improvement.
[4028.82 → 4033.34] Um, so I will be mediocre, you know, all these things we know already.
[4033.78 → 4034.18] Yeah.
[4034.30 → 4038.98] It, I mean, it'll be a better platform at least, um, uh, which will be nice.
[4039.62 → 4042.68] Like, cause, uh, you know, X79 is kind of old now.
[4042.88 → 4045.12] Um, so it'll, it'll at least take care of that.
[4045.68 → 4046.90] Um, but yeah.
[4046.90 → 4048.26] Say to, say to three ports.
[4048.46 → 4048.78] Yes.
[4049.26 → 4049.58] Finally.
[4049.76 → 4049.88] Yeah.
[4050.10 → 4051.70] I'm just not a fan of the trade-off.
[4051.78 → 4054.64] Like I, I don't, for me, I would, I would wait for Bradwell desktop.
[4054.64 → 4057.14] It'll be cheaper and likely be close enough.
[4057.30 → 4059.14] Um, although, you know, eight cores are nice.
[4059.18 → 4061.64] I won't, I won't, I won't hate on that too much.
[4062.22 → 4062.84] Fair enough.
[4063.30 → 4063.84] All right.
[4063.86 → 4067.48] Well, I think that's, uh, I think that's pretty much all the time we have.
[4067.52 → 4068.58] I don't want to keep you too long.
[4068.64 → 4073.74] I think we kept you 10 minutes over time as it is, but, uh, maybe just if you want to give
[4073.74 → 4076.30] the, oh my goodness, I realized we don't have our guest thing up there anymore.
[4076.30 → 4081.18] Um, if you want to give the, uh, the peeps a way to find you, if they're interested in
[4081.18 → 4085.20] whether it's your written work or your Twitter or whatever else, uh, we'd love to at least
[4085.20 → 4088.54] drive a few more followers your way if people enjoyed your presence on the show.
[4088.60 → 4089.60] And I certainly did.
[4089.60 → 4094.48] I think that the viewers have been teasing me in the Twitch chat the entire time for
[4094.48 → 4095.74] fangirling, but I don't care.
[4096.04 → 4096.84] I'm proud of it.
[4097.00 → 4099.78] So just go ahead and let them know where they can find you.
[4100.68 → 4101.28] Okay, cool.
[4101.42 → 4102.48] Yeah, no, thanks for having me.
[4102.68 → 4107.12] Um, you can find, uh, me sometimes at anantech.com.
[4107.18 → 4109.02] That's A-N-A-N-D-T-E-C-H.com.
[4109.10 → 4113.78] Um, or on Twitter, which is at Alan Skimpy, um, A-N-A-N-D-S-H-I-M-P-I.
[4114.10 → 4116.34] Um, and yeah, congrats again on everything, man.
[4116.42 → 4119.38] You've, you've been doing a good job and, uh, thanks for having me on.
[4119.84 → 4120.74] Thank you very much.
[4120.76 → 4121.14] All right.
[4121.20 → 4124.12] Uh, until I see you next, I'll probably run into you at CES somewhere.
[4124.24 → 4125.20] So I'll, I'll come say hi.
[4125.92 → 4126.24] Yep.
[4126.32 → 4131.94] I'll be just completely demoralized and just tired and me too, man.
[4132.18 → 4132.54] Yeah.
[4132.92 → 4133.24] Yep.
[4133.32 → 4134.26] CES is happening.
[4134.92 → 4135.50] All right, man.
[4135.50 → 4135.78] Good luck.
[4135.80 → 4135.94] I know.
[4136.20 → 4139.52] I've been booking all my meetings, and I'm like, I'm looking at my calendar, and I'm just like,
[4139.54 → 4141.16] how the hell am I going to get to all these places?
[4142.04 → 4145.06] Oh, you don't like, you can't, you just, uh, you're just eternally late.
[4145.10 → 4147.06] Like I'm already late to my first CES meeting.
[4147.06 → 4149.36] Like that's just, you just have to assume that that that's the case.
[4149.36 → 4152.98] You embrace the lateness and, and, you know, you'll, you'll be okay.
[4153.40 → 4157.64] NVIDIA is really mad at me because I'm, I think I'm missing their thing because.
[4157.88 → 4158.10] Oh really?
[4158.32 → 4158.60] Yeah.
[4158.60 → 4161.38] I wasn't planning to be down at the show that early.
[4161.62 → 4165.84] So when they sent out the save the date, I just kind of, I meant to send back an email
[4165.84 → 4166.86] that said I couldn't make it.
[4166.94 → 4169.92] But instead I was just like, oh, well, I'm not going to be there.
[4169.98 → 4172.30] So I guess I just won't RSVP when the time comes.
[4172.30 → 4176.22] And at that time they hadn't really been engaging with me as much yet either.
[4176.46 → 4179.46] So I just, I really didn't think about it that much.
[4179.46 → 4184.06] But at the Montreal event, we kind of synced up a little bit more and, and sort of decided
[4184.06 → 4185.50] that we needed to do more together.
[4185.92 → 4190.64] And then, um, so anyway, in the, in the meantime, having not thought about that save the date,
[4190.64 → 4195.54] I, uh, AMD asked me to be at their thing and I kind of went, oh, well, I'm not going to
[4195.54 → 4195.86] be there.
[4195.88 → 4197.22] And they said, oh, well, don't worry about it.
[4197.24 → 4201.28] We'll cover your extra hotel, and we'll cover any fees to change your flight or whatever
[4201.28 → 4201.52] else.
[4201.56 → 4202.50] We really want you to be there.
[4202.52 → 4203.90] And I kind of went, oh, okay, well, sure.
[4204.44 → 4207.92] So now NVIDIA reminds me about that thing, and I'm like, oh, I'll be there.
[4207.96 → 4212.30] But, oh, I'm going to be at AMD's thing because they're covering my hotel.
[4212.44 → 4213.34] I can't be there.
[4213.74 → 4215.36] So that's, that's real awkward.
[4215.36 → 4216.06] They were like, really?
[4216.18 → 4218.08] We sent you a save the date like weeks ago, man.
[4218.14 → 4220.00] I'm like, ah, I'm sorry.
[4220.82 → 4221.18] Yeah.
[4221.18 → 4222.14] That's not going to go over well.
[4222.20 → 4224.00] They'll probably like to have you beaten or something.
[4224.28 → 4224.64] Yeah.
[4225.30 → 4226.04] In Vegas.
[4226.30 → 4229.72] I hope they at least use the bar of soap so that I'm not all bruised for the rest of
[4229.72 → 4229.98] the week.
[4233.28 → 4233.64] Yeah.
[4234.32 → 4236.42] No, they'll just, they'll, they'll toy with you emotionally.
[4236.60 → 4237.86] It's that's usually how it is.
[4238.04 → 4240.16] They'll toy with you emotionally with a bar of soap.
[4242.62 → 4244.60] Or it might involve soap another, I don't know.
[4244.66 → 4244.90] Anyway.
[4245.00 → 4245.28] Okay.
[4245.72 → 4246.80] I'll talk to you later, man.
[4246.84 → 4247.56] I'll see you at the show.
[4248.08 → 4248.58] All right, dude.
[4249.16 → 4249.48] Okay.
[4249.48 → 4249.74] Bye.
[4250.26 → 4250.58] Bye.
[4250.64 → 4252.56] All right.
[4252.66 → 4257.24] So guys, that was awfully fun, at least for me, because I'm such a fan girl of Anon.
[4257.42 → 4258.36] I love everything he does.
[4258.56 → 4262.76] So let's go ahead and move into our sponsor segments for the day.
[4262.90 → 4265.72] So sponsor number one is a new one.
[4266.24 → 4269.26] Intel, this is their first time sponsoring the LAN show.
[4269.40 → 4275.14] So let's give a big virtual round of applause to Intel for having the foresight and the good
[4275.14 → 4277.68] taste to sponsor this tasteful show.
[4277.94 → 4278.86] Foresight and good taste.
[4278.86 → 4279.14] Yeah.
[4279.14 → 4285.46] Speaking of tasteful and bars of soap, the Romans, they have a game called Rome 2 Total War,
[4285.46 → 4289.96] which didn't necessarily get the greatest critical reception right off the bat.
[4289.96 → 4294.30] But for some reason, I'm on their PR contacts mailing list.
[4294.30 → 4299.18] So every time a patch drops, or every time there's a new DLC, I'm getting emails about it.
[4299.18 → 4301.72] So apparently, they've fixed a lot of stuff.
[4301.72 → 4307.90] And even if it's not 100% fixed now, it is definitely moving in the right direction.
[4307.90 → 4309.10] They're working on the AI.
[4309.10 → 4311.78] They're adding more campaign elements and all that good stuff.
[4311.78 → 4327.52] So if nothing else, if you were planning to buy a Core i5 or Core i7 4th gen processor, so basically, a 4670K, unlocked 4th gen processor, so a 4670K or a 4770K, then you might as well get your free copy of Rome 2 Total War from participating retailers.
[4327.52 → 4328.52] So I know it's at New egg.
[4328.52 → 4329.52] I know it's at NCI.
[4329.52 → 4330.52] I know it's at Amazon.
[4330.52 → 4335.80] Those are the ones that I'm 100% aware of, but there may be other ones as well.
[4335.80 → 4349.28] And if you're building a PC for someone else, who's one of the things I used to do all the time when I built PCs for people, when I actually had any time at all in the universe, was I would make the deal, I'll build your PC for you for free, but I want your game coupons.
[4349.72 → 4358.40] So even if you're not building a PC for yourself, maybe try and figure out how to scoop a free copy by having them buy their processor from a qualifying retailer.
[4358.54 → 4359.14] So there you go, guys.
[4359.56 → 4364.28] Our next one is, oh, apparently we just dropped a bunch of frames, like, all of a sudden.
[4364.28 → 4367.20] We've been fairly consistently dropping frames.
[4367.28 → 4368.06] We're still live, though.
[4368.10 → 4368.34] Sweet.
[4368.84 → 4369.28] All right.
[4369.32 → 4370.24] Our other sponsor today.
[4370.66 → 4372.78] Where is my lower third for Hotspot Shield?
[4374.28 → 4376.18] Oh, I don't think we've run a Hotspot Shield.
[4376.28 → 4376.80] You know what?
[4377.08 → 4379.36] The stream was going so smoothly.
[4379.86 → 4380.86] It was going really well.
[4380.98 → 4382.58] I asked you right before we went live, too.
[4382.98 → 4383.20] Yep.
[4383.20 → 4383.64] All right.
[4384.58 → 4385.46] Hotspot Shield.
[4385.46 → 4391.10] So Hotspot Shield is the easy VPN solution that I actually had to use in order to WhatsApp.
[4391.56 → 4392.70] Oh, I guess I can take these off.
[4392.70 → 4397.94] That I had to use in order to get my Google Glass, because I had to pretend I was from the United States.
[4398.28 → 4404.92] What a VPN does, for those of you who aren't familiar, although I'm sure most of you are, because you're all regular watchers of the show, and you always watch us every Friday, right?
[4405.46 → 4407.46] You know, nothing else to do on a Friday evening.
[4407.64 → 4409.30] Lord knows we don't have anything better to do tonight.
[4409.48 → 4409.60] Nope.
[4409.60 → 4415.18] So I had to use Hotspot Shield VPN in order to fake where I was located.
[4415.18 → 4418.58] I had to pretend I was in the U.S., and Hotspot Shield does that just fine.
[4418.84 → 4423.36] This is great for useful things like buying things that are only available in the U.S.
[4423.36 → 4436.14] It's great for things like accessing services that are only available in the U.S., such as U.S. Netflix, if you happen to not be in America and you want to watch all the latest episodes of all the latest cool stuff, as well as many other online video streaming services.
[4436.14 → 4436.86] It's great for that.
[4436.94 → 4442.28] It's great for protecting your identity and your location, which people can find out quite easily using your IP address.
[4442.28 → 4445.36] I mean, it's a little bit tougher to find out your identity, but your location, certainly.
[4445.84 → 4455.68] Using your IP address, if you go through a VPN service, such as Hotspot Shield, and it works on your PC, on your mobile devices, and, I guess, well, PC and mobile devices, right?
[4455.76 → 4455.92] Yeah.
[4456.20 → 4456.52] Yay!
[4456.74 → 4457.18] Hotspot Shield.
[4457.18 → 4463.78] So, you can get 20% off Elite prices by using code Linus on your very first purchase, so go ahead and check that out, guys.
[4463.90 → 4465.36] It is definitely better than...
[4465.36 → 4465.50] Oh.
[4466.10 → 4466.88] Yeah, that's interesting.
[4467.20 → 4469.30] Apparently, someone says, do not use Hotspot Shield.
[4469.40 → 4471.74] They make it extremely difficult to cancel a subscription.
[4471.74 → 4473.30] We'll still charge you after you cancel it.
[4473.50 → 4474.68] That's from Dangerous Person.
[4474.82 → 4482.82] Okay, well, one thing that I can respond to that with is if you post a problem with Hotspot Shield on the Hotspot Shield thread on Linus Tech Tips Forum,
[4482.82 → 4486.30] they have people that will take care of that for you right away.
[4486.40 → 4493.58] So, we actually get special service for our forum members from an escalation point that is above the regular customer service.
[4493.86 → 4495.28] So, yay!
[4496.08 → 4497.12] Definitely check them out.
[4497.12 → 4498.52] One thing.
[4498.86 → 4502.92] Is wearing a Team OCT shirt, like, is that in mourning?
[4503.26 → 4505.78] Is this, like, a sign of, like, I miss you?
[4505.84 → 4506.98] No, it's just a nice shirt.
[4507.12 → 4508.00] It's, um...
[4508.00 → 4508.48] What is it?
[4508.48 → 4509.12] So, it has nothing to do with...
[4509.12 → 4509.78] It's American Apparel.
[4510.12 → 4510.92] Oh, yeah, there you go.
[4510.92 → 4511.10] Yeah.
[4511.10 → 4512.36] Swag shirts from American Apparel.
[4512.44 → 4512.92] I know!
[4513.50 → 4514.14] They're awesome.
[4514.66 → 4515.86] So, it's just, like...
[4515.86 → 4516.92] And I don't know, it's so subtle.
[4517.04 → 4519.56] Like, I bet no one even noticed I was wearing an OCT shirt.
[4519.78 → 4519.92] They did.
[4520.42 → 4520.84] Oh, did they?
[4520.94 → 4521.14] Really?
[4521.28 → 4522.00] Oh, I'm surprised.
[4522.12 → 4527.90] It's just, it's just funny because of the recent, like, purchase and bankruptcy whatnot thing that was going on.
[4528.98 → 4532.30] Lam Goodall says, don't listen to dangerous person.
[4532.40 → 4534.72] He called me, uh, expletive, expletive, expletive.
[4535.84 → 4538.12] Okay, well, we're not trying to discredit the guy.
[4538.20 → 4540.30] He might be, you know, might have had a bad experience.
[4540.30 → 4545.14] I'm just saying that you can get special service if you go through the Linus Tech Tips Forum, which is awesome, by the way.
[4545.14 → 4550.62] Before we move on, I want to quickly go through my favourite moments of the Anand-Linus meeting version 2.
[4550.78 → 4551.10] Really?
[4551.28 → 4552.66] That's how you're going to be about this?
[4552.74 → 4553.10] Wow.
[4553.22 → 4560.56] I think that was the most glorious, fantastic, incredibly shiny intro we've ever had for anyone ever.
[4560.92 → 4565.74] Which was the like, I love you, please don't run away because I love you so much intro.
[4565.98 → 4566.96] Which was amazing.
[4567.46 → 4572.00] Um, I don't think you've ever asked someone if you could interrupt them before.
[4572.00 → 4575.38] Nope, I usually do just talk over them.
[4575.38 → 4580.68] Yep, and then after that, you then interrupted him, but paused for a second, you're like, oh, I'm sorry.
[4581.84 → 4582.92] Like, is this okay?
[4583.44 → 4585.96] And then he said yes, and then you kept going, which was fantastic.
[4586.44 → 4589.70] And then later on, you went to go interrupt him, but then stopped yourself and said,
[4589.98 → 4594.06] oh, I want to bring this up later, but you can keep going.
[4594.38 → 4594.90] It's okay.
[4595.08 → 4597.68] And then drew back, and I thought that was just fantastic.
[4597.68 → 4602.78] And then once it was over, even though it had gone over time, you made it continue.
[4604.32 → 4606.92] Which was just, it was just beautiful.
[4608.16 → 4610.56] I wish I still had, do we still have the footage?
[4611.52 → 4612.12] I don't know.
[4612.48 → 4613.46] I'm actually not sure.
[4613.54 → 4614.52] I don't know what they did with it.
[4614.58 → 4615.20] They hid it from me.
[4615.54 → 4618.44] If we still have the footage, I might leak some of it on the after party tonight.
[4618.60 → 4619.72] But I'm not sure if we still have the footage.
[4619.72 → 4621.28] Wow, that's how you're going to be about this.
[4621.34 → 4623.86] Oh, I forgot, we have some other sponsor messages.
[4623.86 → 4629.54] We talked about our CES sponsors last week, so NCI is our gold sponsor.
[4629.68 → 4633.82] Basically, they're paying the bulk of what it costs for us to be at CES and bring you
[4633.82 → 4636.44] guys the awesome content that we're going to bring you guys from there.
[4636.70 → 4640.82] Our second sponsor is Corsair, so they're one of our two silver sponsors.
[4641.38 → 4643.60] And then our third sponsor is confirmed now.
[4643.84 → 4647.50] It's funny because last week on the show, when I was like, yeah, it'll probably be WD,
[4647.74 → 4649.78] they had not confirmed anything.
[4650.08 → 4652.30] They basically hadn't replied to my email.
[4652.30 → 4659.62] So I got on the phone with them this week, and I was like, so I haven't sent out proposals
[4659.62 → 4662.22] to anyone else, because I was really hoping you guys would take it.
[4662.28 → 4664.54] And they're just like, oh, yeah, okay, I guess so.
[4664.62 → 4666.24] Sure, yeah, yeah, we'll take it, we'll take it.
[4666.74 → 4674.24] So I also have something pretty exciting to tell you guys about WD's presence at the show.
[4674.36 → 4681.30] They are doing a WD fan night, which you can only get to if you hear about it through someone
[4681.30 → 4682.80] that they're affiliated with.
[4682.86 → 4686.06] Basically, this isn't just on the WD website, okay?
[4686.12 → 4687.82] You have to hear about it somewhere.
[4688.26 → 4692.00] Spaces will fill up if you're planning to be at CES.
[4692.28 → 4695.70] If you're planning, so if you're going to be down in Las Vegas at the beginning of January,
[4695.70 → 4700.88] you can register at WDpromotion.com slash WD fan night.
[4700.88 → 4706.70] And there's going to be creative professionals such as renowned sports illustrative photographer
[4706.70 → 4711.24] Peter Reed Miller, professional gamers, Sara and ODE from Team Digital.
[4711.86 → 4715.38] Artist Drew Trophy, musician Mike I. Paris from the band OAR.
[4716.24 → 4717.88] Or, I don't even know who any of these people are.
[4718.02 → 4723.64] I live on, like, another planet where all that exists is work and my baby.
[4723.64 → 4727.72] He's always like, oh, why do you think I'm, like, out of tune with society and stuff?
[4727.96 → 4731.64] And then if you go watch and if you go back and watch the Omni video when he's like,
[4731.98 → 4732.48] Converse?
[4733.72 → 4735.74] No one's seen Converse before.
[4736.20 → 4738.08] Because I don't leave my house, okay?
[4738.94 → 4740.14] Or this place.
[4740.96 → 4742.32] Anyway, guys, check it out.
[4742.36 → 4743.36] WD fan night.
[4743.74 → 4745.18] I'm pretty sure I'll be there.
[4745.24 → 4746.20] I think it's on my calendar.
[4746.68 → 4748.16] That's Tuesday, January 7th.
[4748.16 → 4749.10] Let me check my calendar.
[4749.10 → 4754.18] So, guys, please only sign up if you're actually going to be in Vegas during that time, and you're
[4754.18 → 4755.46] actually planning to go there.
[4755.92 → 4759.34] So, you know, you don't want to take away a spot from someone else who could otherwise
[4759.34 → 4759.96] be there.
[4760.34 → 4762.24] But, yes, I will be there.
[4762.38 → 4765.04] I will be there on WD fan appreciation night.
[4765.10 → 4766.16] So, that's going to be pretty cool.
[4767.14 → 4767.54] Okay.
[4768.20 → 4772.14] So, I think without further ado, I don't have any topics to further ado right now.
[4772.14 → 4777.36] Because for some reason, in my awe of Anand while he was on the show, I closed my topics
[4777.36 → 4777.64] doc.
[4777.64 → 4779.32] So, go ahead and find our next one here.
[4779.94 → 4781.42] Splurged out the topics' doc somehow.
[4781.78 → 4785.46] Either way, we can do consumer versus enterprise hard drive reliability.
[4785.70 → 4786.92] So, I believe...
[4786.92 → 4789.78] The article was such BS, unfortunately.
[4790.06 → 4792.12] I mean, it would have been great if it was real.
[4793.04 → 4793.36] So...
[4793.36 → 4795.10] Well, it's real.
[4795.18 → 4795.76] It's real.
[4795.88 → 4798.42] It's just not scientifically valid in any way.
[4798.58 → 4803.80] So, this was tweeted to me by Austin, at top-notch PC lol.
[4803.80 → 4808.90] Guys, to be clear, tweeting something at me is not the best way to get an article featured
[4808.90 → 4809.36] on the show.
[4809.48 → 4811.80] Please post in the news section of Linus Tech Tips forum.
[4812.52 → 4815.94] But, sometimes I do happen to see things on Twitter, and they do make their way into the
[4815.94 → 4816.18] doc.
[4816.18 → 4822.18] So, Back blaze finds enterprise drives fail more often than consumer hard drives is the
[4822.18 → 4827.48] extremely incendiary top... or headline of this article.
[4827.48 → 4828.66] So, I'll let you tear it apart.
[4828.66 → 4831.36] I think they're just mad, to be completely honest.
[4831.58 → 4832.90] I'm assuming that's where this is coming from.
[4832.98 → 4834.50] They're like, oh, why are so many failing?
[4834.62 → 4835.36] Let's rip them apart.
[4835.68 → 4840.04] Because they have to understand that the way they did this was not entirely true.
[4840.34 → 4846.06] And, like, a lot of the quotes that are in this are directly from Back blaze's blog.
[4846.40 → 4847.10] It's a lot of Bs.
[4847.16 → 4847.84] Back blaze blog.
[4848.16 → 4848.56] Looper.
[4848.72 → 4853.76] Like, it's directly in there where it's like, well, do you think reliability of these make
[4853.76 → 4854.14] any sense?
[4854.22 → 4854.44] No.
[4854.60 → 4855.60] Like, it's all...
[4855.60 → 4857.98] The sensationalized part is in Back blaze's blog.
[4857.98 → 4859.36] So, that was kind of interesting.
[4859.70 → 4863.62] The sample size is, like, not okay.
[4864.26 → 4869.80] There are 368 enterprise drives and there's 14,719 consumer drives.
[4870.48 → 4872.38] Um, where is it?
[4872.86 → 4873.62] Oh, crap.
[4875.00 → 4876.10] Where was the failure rates?
[4876.74 → 4877.82] I thought you put it in the doc.
[4877.86 → 4878.52] I thought I did, too.
[4878.60 → 4884.46] So, apparently 17 enterprise drives failed over two years and 613 consumer drives failed.
[4884.46 → 4889.54] Then they broke it down to percentages and found that 4.6% of the enterprise drives failed,
[4889.74 → 4892.62] while 4.2% of the consumer drives failed.
[4892.74 → 4895.60] But there's a big problem with that, which you outlined here perfectly.
[4896.06 → 4897.90] Which is where if one enterprise...
[4897.90 → 4902.04] One less enterprise drive failed, they were almost equated for percentages.
[4902.34 → 4905.48] And if two less failed, it was, like, a chunk better.
[4905.62 → 4907.32] Like, 2.2% better.
[4907.78 → 4909.08] Which is, like, no.
[4909.32 → 4913.14] To be able to do an actual study like this, you need, one, the sample sizes need to be
[4913.14 → 4914.08] the same freaking side.
[4914.34 → 4916.82] And two, they weren't tested in the same environments.
[4916.82 → 4918.72] Yes, they were tested in very different environments.
[4918.86 → 4919.54] So, the enterprise...
[4919.54 → 4924.50] Basically, the only real conclusion that we can take away from this, because the enterprise
[4924.50 → 4929.18] drives were tested in a much heavier workload than the consumer-grade drives.
[4929.34 → 4934.66] So, all we can take away from this is that enterprise drives, when being used in their
[4934.66 → 4940.72] intended workload, which is much heavier, might fail about the same as consumer-grade drives
[4940.72 → 4942.08] when used in a lighter workload.
[4942.54 → 4945.60] Which is, like, what hard drive manufacturer wouldn't have freaking told you that?
[4945.60 → 4951.50] There was even some more wonky stuff, too, because the enterprise drives had nicer, more
[4951.50 → 4956.22] padded enclosures, but not by much, but then were worked a lot harder.
[4956.66 → 4960.52] And then the consumer drives had not as good enclosures that had a little bit more vibration,
[4960.70 → 4962.24] but then weren't worked as much.
[4962.58 → 4965.36] So, like, there's even more weird variables that you're throwing in.
[4965.40 → 4966.36] So many variables.
[4966.60 → 4966.72] Yeah.
[4966.84 → 4971.22] So, one thing, one good takeaway from this, in my mind, is that, holy crap, consumer drives
[4971.22 → 4972.38] don't fail that much.
[4972.46 → 4973.28] Yeah, that was cool.
[4973.28 → 4973.76] That's really cool.
[4973.76 → 4975.54] Because we use consumer drives in our server.
[4975.66 → 4975.92] Yep.
[4976.08 → 4977.70] We use a lot of refurbished ones.
[4977.76 → 4978.10] No, no.
[4978.16 → 4979.46] There are no refers in the server right now.
[4979.46 → 4979.60] Okay.
[4979.72 → 4980.06] That's good.
[4980.12 → 4987.34] Although our storage expansion upgrade that's coming soon, so the working drive for 4K footage
[4987.34 → 4989.36] is probably going to be return drives.
[4989.70 → 4990.44] But it's a working drive.
[4990.44 → 4991.40] But it'll be RAID 10.
[4992.06 → 4992.32] Okay.
[4992.32 → 4997.36] So, it's not going to be reliant on, you know, absolutely no drives can fail, OMG.
[4997.94 → 5000.94] So, I'm going to throw a RAID 10 in there of 3 terabyte return drives.
[5001.30 → 5001.48] Cool.
[5001.68 → 5005.92] But, yeah, like, this article was not really right, in my opinion.
[5006.04 → 5008.00] But it's still an interesting thing to look at.
[5008.22 → 5011.26] And, like, take the percentages not really 100% to heart.
[5011.40 → 5015.30] But you can look at it still and just, I don't know, maybe be a little bit more confident
[5015.30 → 5016.26] in your consumer drive.
[5016.52 → 5018.52] And just make sure that it has good padding.
[5018.98 → 5019.74] And you're probably good to go.
[5019.74 → 5023.20] All right, so this one, apparently I screwed up.
[5023.70 → 5028.60] And let me just make sure that there's nothing showing on my screen right now that's going
[5028.60 → 5030.02] to be a problem.
[5030.96 → 5031.88] I don't think so.
[5032.00 → 5032.96] Does my hangouts matter?
[5033.06 → 5033.82] I can sign out, right?
[5033.96 → 5035.52] It shows the names.
[5035.90 → 5036.04] Yeah.
[5036.12 → 5036.90] Okay, there we go.
[5037.08 → 5037.56] Let's hold on.
[5037.64 → 5038.40] Let's scroll down.
[5038.50 → 5039.06] Should be fine.
[5040.58 → 5040.76] Yep.
[5040.94 → 5042.86] There's probably going to be something.
[5043.00 → 5043.22] Yeah.
[5043.22 → 5044.16] But I don't see anything.
[5044.52 → 5045.00] So, here we go.
[5045.40 → 5045.78] All right.
[5045.86 → 5047.14] So, screen share time, guys.
[5047.20 → 5048.64] This was a PM someone sent me.
[5048.64 → 5050.76] Please post in the news section of the forum.
[5051.14 → 5051.58] Anyway.
[5051.68 → 5052.14] Just don't go up.
[5052.36 → 5053.38] Here's a panel.
[5053.76 → 5059.72] So, this is on the subject of the Dell 4K 28-inch monitor that's actually less expensive
[5059.72 → 5063.14] than the 4K 24-inch monitor, but uses a TN panel.
[5063.54 → 5066.54] So, someone, I don't even remember who it was because they didn't post it in the forum.
[5066.60 → 5066.68] Oh, it is TN.
[5066.68 → 5070.52] So, someone said, here's a panel someone on G found.
[5070.86 → 5074.98] It seems to match up pretty well with what we know about the 28-inch monitor Dell's releasing
[5074.98 → 5075.90] for under $1,000.
[5076.38 → 5080.56] It is a TN panel, but it seems to be a perfect TN panel.
[5080.84 → 5086.32] So, it has wide colour gamut, 10-bit colour depth, although I've seen 6-bit TN panels that
[5086.32 → 5089.14] are definitely not as good as 6-bit IPS panels.
[5089.14 → 5090.44] So, let's be real clear.
[5090.74 → 5092.86] More bits is not necessarily the most important thing in the world.
[5093.28 → 5095.08] 60 hertz refresh rate, which makes sense.
[5095.50 → 5097.04] And 80-degree viewing angle.
[5097.10 → 5101.26] It would make sense for it to be a TN panel since it's only $1,000, but it might not be
[5101.26 → 5102.62] that bad after all.
[5103.14 → 5104.12] So, there it is, guys.
[5104.22 → 5107.38] The N280DGJ-L30.
[5108.12 → 5113.54] And the specs look like they are potentially not that bad.
[5113.56 → 5113.76] Oops.
[5113.84 → 5114.02] Sorry.
[5114.12 → 5114.30] Sorry.
[5114.40 → 5114.58] Sorry.
[5114.94 → 5115.18] Hey.
[5115.62 → 5116.02] What the?
[5116.42 → 5117.42] You somehow...
[5117.42 → 5117.84] Oh, wow.
[5117.84 → 5118.50] What have I done?
[5118.50 → 5118.82] Okay.
[5118.92 → 5119.44] Hold on, guys.
[5119.52 → 5120.48] Bear with me for a second here.
[5121.94 → 5122.56] Where is it?
[5123.56 → 5123.92] Okay.
[5124.12 → 5124.48] Wow.
[5124.68 → 5125.34] Not sure what happened there.
[5125.42 → 5125.58] Okay.
[5125.72 → 5126.28] Anyway, we're back.
[5128.28 → 5133.18] So, to be clear, good TN panels exist.
[5133.92 → 5134.98] They're still not.
[5135.30 → 5136.94] The one uses a TN panel.
[5137.04 → 5137.20] Yeah.
[5137.56 → 5138.62] The viewing angles are excellent.
[5138.74 → 5140.06] The colour reproduction is excellent.
[5141.14 → 5142.28] So, they do exist.
[5142.38 → 5142.50] Yep.
[5142.50 → 5147.90] They are slower than the overdriven TN panels that we find in products like that Asus monitor
[5147.90 → 5153.08] that both Alan and I agree, which of course fills me with much, much wonderment.
[5153.44 → 5161.56] Both agree isn't very good because it's overdriven to refresh 144 times a second and still give you a crystal clear image.
[5161.56 → 5164.72] That means they just can't do as much with the quality of that image.
[5165.20 → 5170.00] So, a good TN panel might not necessarily be as optimal for gaming.
[5170.10 → 5174.20] It might not be as fast, but the viewing angles and the colour reproduction might actually be okay.
[5174.20 → 5179.16] So, I'm pretty excited to see what Dell has up their sleeve with this 28-inch 4K monitor.
[5179.74 → 5184.92] Because, in my mind, 24 may actually be a touch too small to even justify 4K.
[5185.00 → 5188.72] I mean, a 2560 by 1440, 24-inch, that's not bad.
[5189.26 → 5190.82] It'll be hard to pick out the individual pixels.
[5191.56 → 5191.78] Huh.
[5191.92 → 5192.52] I'm not sure.
[5192.62 → 5194.20] Well, I'll have to, like, compare them.
[5195.14 → 5195.48] Yeah.
[5195.68 → 5195.92] I guess that's...
[5195.92 → 5198.76] To be honest, I'd have to see them close up.
[5198.96 → 5201.08] Alright, we're digging into my email again for...
[5201.08 → 5201.82] Do you have another topic?
[5201.88 → 5203.80] Do you want to do maybe a rapid-fire topic while I dig this up?
[5203.80 → 5206.16] I can jump onto one, if you give me one second.
[5206.48 → 5211.78] Some of the rapid-fire topics got all messed up, but we can jump into the Xbox One thing.
[5212.18 → 5212.64] Ah, yes.
[5212.64 → 5213.66] Because this is hilarious.
[5213.90 → 5215.30] So trolled!
[5215.84 → 5220.88] So, apparently, someone released an image, which we can maybe hopefully get on screen here soon,
[5221.20 → 5223.48] which looks fairly official.
[5223.48 → 5226.16] Like, it's not super well done, but it's okay.
[5226.66 → 5229.72] It says, Xbox 360 backwards compatibility unlock.
[5230.38 → 5234.28] By default, Xbox 360 backwards compatibility is disabled on Xbox One.
[5234.36 → 5235.84] To unlock it, follow these steps.
[5236.06 → 5237.94] One, go to the system menu.
[5238.28 → 5241.16] Two, press left button, right button, left trigger, right trigger.
[5241.16 → 5243.20] I know, but we might be doing podcasts soon.
[5243.60 → 5244.00] Oh, right.
[5244.44 → 5245.16] In order to...
[5245.76 → 5251.16] In order quickly, select the developer console, check the enable dev kit box,
[5251.16 → 5256.44] change sandbox ID to free zone. Reboot, which is where you should start thinking this is kind of bull crap.
[5258.04 → 5260.76] Six, select reset home console, and then it says,
[5260.84 → 5263.46] Xbox 360 games will now be playable on your console.
[5263.72 → 5265.94] The problem is, it will just boot loop infinitely,
[5266.10 → 5269.24] because you put it into reboot mode, where it will just continuously reboot,
[5269.44 → 5270.88] and will never actually really do anything.
[5271.84 → 5273.54] Essentially, breaking your Xbox One.
[5273.54 → 5274.74] Breaking your Xbox One.
[5274.74 → 5279.00] But wait, it gets better, folks, because that's not all from this week.
[5279.08 → 5280.34] We also have...
[5280.34 → 5282.78] Troll number two!
[5282.86 → 5284.58] Which is even better, in my opinion.
[5284.60 → 5285.32] Which is actually even better.
[5285.44 → 5286.76] Did you know...
[5286.76 → 5287.78] .tumblr.com
[5287.78 → 5291.36] Any iPhone can be charged in the microwave oven.
[5291.72 → 5294.54] 15 to 25 times faster than the charger that came with it.
[5294.58 → 5295.18] Try it now.
[5295.58 → 5296.66] Plug your cable into the iPhone.
[5296.78 → 5299.42] Put your iPhone in the centre of the oven and coil the surrounding cable.
[5299.42 → 5302.20] Step three, set the timer in the oven for 10 to 20 seconds.
[5302.34 → 5305.04] Step four, you now have a charged iPhone.
[5305.44 → 5308.52] This works because microwaves use the same principle as wireless charging pads
[5308.52 → 5312.20] by rearranging the electrons in your phone's battery to gather at the negative terminal.
[5312.46 → 5314.16] Remember to leave your cable plugged in.
[5315.16 → 5321.08] So, there are some Yahoos Answers posts with folks being like,
[5321.52 → 5326.10] Hey, I tried it. Is there any way I can fix it now?
[5326.64 → 5328.74] And the answer is no, unfortunately.
[5328.74 → 5331.32] I love how the best answer on that one is like,
[5331.44 → 5332.80] Dude, you zapped your phone.
[5336.24 → 5339.12] It's like, yeah, no, you screwed up on that one.
[5339.52 → 5341.46] Not going to work out for you at all.
[5341.58 → 5344.20] Yeah, that is a crying shame right there.
[5344.50 → 5348.92] Alright, so I'm ready with this next article that's in my email, supposedly.
[5350.08 → 5351.30] No, I am not.
[5351.38 → 5352.80] Hold on, I'll be ready in a second, though.
[5352.88 → 5353.48] I'm almost ready.
[5353.78 → 5354.14] Okay.
[5354.26 → 5354.76] I'm almost ready.
[5354.82 → 5355.68] Should I try and grab something?
[5355.68 → 5360.94] The Apple Smartwatch is rumoured to be coming in October 2014 and will apparently support wireless charging.
[5362.14 → 5363.84] I guess I kind of said the whole thing.
[5363.90 → 5366.28] I was just going to say, is that the whole topic?
[5366.78 → 5367.64] That's the whole topic.
[5367.68 → 5368.16] Is there more?
[5368.42 → 5368.66] Okay.
[5368.80 → 5370.06] What was the original source again?
[5370.14 → 5370.62] I can't remember.
[5370.68 → 5371.44] For the Apple Smartwatch?
[5371.50 → 5371.80] Yeah.
[5371.80 → 5375.18] They have been right about stuff in the past.
[5375.30 → 5376.90] That was our forum.
[5377.32 → 5379.18] They've also been wrong about stuff in the past.
[5379.30 → 5381.80] So the original poster was...
[5382.76 → 5383.24] Joe Petit?
[5383.96 → 5384.54] Joe Petit?
[5384.66 → 5385.36] Joe Petit.
[5385.84 → 5386.12] Yeah.
[5386.56 → 5388.16] And the source is tweakers.net.
[5388.60 → 5394.08] Alright, so let's go ahead and hop over to Linus' screen where Samsung sent me a pretty awesome email
[5394.08 → 5398.58] about their Rapid technology being available on 840 Pro SSDs now.
[5398.66 → 5403.06] So if you already have an 840 Pro and the 840 Eve came out, and you were like,
[5403.24 → 5403.56] Samsung?
[5404.20 → 5404.48] Hey.
[5405.44 → 5406.20] Hey, Samsung?
[5406.98 → 5407.60] Hey, what?
[5407.86 → 5408.46] What's going on?
[5408.70 → 5409.96] Why don't I have Rapid technology?
[5410.44 → 5411.32] Because Rapid is cool.
[5411.46 → 5412.04] What is this?
[5412.08 → 5416.04] Rapid allows you to use your RAM to accelerate your storage subsystem.
[5416.04 → 5419.62] It can use up to a gig of your RAM at a time, and it's awesome and it works.
[5419.80 → 5424.12] But it was only available on Samsung, your consumer-grade drive, not your pro-grade drive.
[5424.16 → 5424.60] What is this?
[5424.76 → 5430.56] So it's now available for existing 840 Pro owners or anyone who buys that SSD in the future.
[5430.82 → 5435.38] And they've also enabled some new trusted computing thing on the 840 Eve,
[5435.46 → 5439.30] which I'm sure is important, but I'm not as interested in that as raw performance.
[5439.44 → 5445.14] And finally, they have a 1TB mSATA SSD now.
[5445.14 → 5450.78] So it's an 840 Eve, meaning you have support for Rapid, meaning you have support for their,
[5450.96 → 5454.38] you know, awesome data migration utility and all that great stuff.
[5454.68 → 5458.86] And you have 1TB of storage in a notebook.
[5458.86 → 5459.64] That's pretty sick.
[5459.72 → 5461.14] Which is just ballin'.
[5461.72 → 5466.62] My favourite part about mSATA SSDs is like, they're like that big.
[5466.76 → 5467.12] Yeah, I know.
[5467.30 → 5467.52] They're tiny.
[5467.52 → 5470.64] They have so many ridiculous amounts of storage on them.
[5470.70 → 5471.00] I know.
[5471.06 → 5471.48] It's amazing.
[5471.48 → 5475.52] It's kind of like those SanDisk USB drives that we had.
[5475.72 → 5477.04] I showed you those things, right?
[5477.10 → 5479.06] Where it's like literally the size of the connector.
[5479.18 → 5481.22] Like I put it in, I'm like, how am I supposed to get this out of the port?
[5481.42 → 5481.62] Yeah.
[5481.76 → 5482.94] And it's like 64 gigs.
[5483.08 → 5485.38] It's like, where'd you put that?
[5485.84 → 5488.56] And we have SD cards now from Kingston.
[5488.64 → 5491.40] Oh no, we have a micro SD from SanDisk as well.
[5491.66 → 5496.36] That is 64 gigs and can do like 45 megabytes per second writes and like 90 legs per second reads.
[5496.46 → 5497.24] It's ridiculous.
[5497.24 → 5502.50] Flash storage, it's not the end of development and improvements there.
[5502.56 → 5503.98] I know we're dropping a lot of frames, guys.
[5504.06 → 5505.30] There's not a lot we can do about it right now.
[5505.30 → 5508.92] I've been talking to the Twitch chat about all the different problems and whatnot that are going on with the frames.
[5509.02 → 5509.72] We're good, I think.
[5510.26 → 5510.92] We'll make it through.
[5511.38 → 5513.78] So I think we covered all of our main topics for this week.
[5513.82 → 5514.82] Do we have anything left?
[5515.20 → 5517.48] We have some stuff, but...
[5517.48 → 5518.24] This is hilarious.
[5518.58 → 5519.28] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5519.28 → 5522.00] This is actually slightly older news, guys, but check this out.
[5522.06 → 5524.50] This is from holycaw.altop.com.
[5525.64 → 5534.44] 140,000 VHS tapes from 1977 to 2012 were found in storage.
[5534.98 → 5535.16] Alright?
[5535.16 → 5546.88] So basically, Ms. Stokes, this lady, died at age 83 and at some point in 1977, she decided that she was going to tape all the news ever.
[5548.12 → 5549.98] So she planned her life around it.
[5550.32 → 5560.34] She would feed six-hour tapes into the news channel recorders late at night, and then she'd wake up early the next day to change them or conscript family members to do it if she wasn't home.
[5560.34 → 5564.42] She'd cut short meals at restaurants to rush home before tapes ended.
[5564.80 → 5569.52] And when she got too old to keep up, she trained a younger helper named Frank to run the various recording equipment.
[5569.80 → 5573.34] So it is potentially the most...
[5574.34 → 5581.30] The most complete news recording archive in existence.
[5581.76 → 5585.32] And it's on 140,000 VHS tapes.
[5585.58 → 5587.62] And who's going to deal with that?
[5587.62 → 5592.48] I'd have to imagine.
[5592.62 → 5593.96] It has to end up somewhere.
[5594.16 → 5596.12] You can't just throw all that history away.
[5596.30 → 5597.24] I know, but like...
[5597.24 → 5598.12] Because that's amazing.
[5598.40 → 5599.92] I know, but who's going to do it?
[5600.34 → 5600.98] I don't know.
[5602.04 → 5603.58] Okay, one thing that I don't know if this is true.
[5603.58 → 5605.54] Maybe the oatmeal can inspire people to do it.
[5605.76 → 5610.32] If he can build a Nikolai Tesla museum, then maybe he can do this.
[5610.38 → 5610.70] Maybe.
[5611.20 → 5613.46] The oatmeal, if you're watching, which I know you aren't.
[5613.48 → 5613.94] He's not.
[5614.04 → 5614.38] I know.
[5614.56 → 5615.76] It's way too cool for us.
[5615.76 → 5616.60] I love the oatmeal.
[5617.62 → 5618.02] Okay.
[5618.36 → 5619.40] You got a Anti to watch.
[5619.50 → 5626.68] If we can get the oatmeal on this show, then during his entire guest segment, I will...
[5626.68 → 5630.16] Like, I'll go behind the couch, I will take my underwear off, and I will wear them on my head.
[5630.86 → 5632.54] For the entire guest segment.
[5632.82 → 5633.04] Okay?
[5633.56 → 5637.86] If someone can convince the oatmeal to come and be on our show for half an hour.
[5638.34 → 5641.04] Because I would fangirl out so hard.
[5641.10 → 5643.10] Would you fangirl out as hard as you do with Want?
[5643.10 → 5647.38] He hasn't had as much of an impact on the direction of my life as Want.
[5648.66 → 5649.80] But I think he's awesome.
[5649.98 → 5651.22] Well, no, he has.
[5651.40 → 5651.76] I know.
[5651.84 → 5653.64] I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing today.
[5653.98 → 5654.48] I know.
[5654.70 → 5655.20] You know what?
[5655.32 → 5655.88] Screw you.
[5655.96 → 5658.80] He hasn't had this profound impact on my life.
[5659.20 → 5661.44] He hasn't driven me to do great things.
[5661.44 → 5664.66] In other news, the Nexus 5 has had a silent hardware revision.
[5664.66 → 5666.46] We weren't even done talking about the last topic.
[5666.46 → 5667.60] Oh, we're done talking about it now.
[5668.50 → 5671.12] The Nexus 5, this was posted by Joe Petit.
[5671.18 → 5671.68] Joe Petit?
[5671.76 → 5672.30] I don't know, man.
[5672.64 → 5678.90] Joe Petit on the forum has had a silent hardware revision that actually addresses one of my major complaints about the...
[5678.90 → 5680.36] Well, two of my major complaints about the device.
[5680.44 → 5683.28] Number one is that they have expanded the speaker grills.
[5683.64 → 5683.88] See?
[5684.00 → 5685.80] They're bigger now, so more sound in theory.
[5685.80 → 5692.36] Number two is they have updated the buttons to be harder to press and more cliquey, a little bit more tactile.
[5692.96 → 5697.98] This might have seemed like a petty complaint, and I think some people didn't like this in my Nexus 5 review.
[5698.48 → 5702.36] But to me, having buttons positioned so that when you go to press one of them,
[5702.58 → 5707.38] you accidentally press the one that is opposed to it on the other side of the phone is a big usability problem.
[5707.50 → 5709.94] Accidentally changing your volume all the time or whatever else is a problem.
[5710.26 → 5712.24] I don't like that on the HTC One as well.
[5712.24 → 5716.48] That's one of my major complaints on this phone because the lock is up here, the volume is here,
[5716.60 → 5720.82] so the way a right-handed person might hold the phone to unlock it is like this,
[5720.90 → 5723.30] and you often mash that volume button, and they're not...
[5723.30 → 5726.34] They don't stick out far enough, and they're not hard enough to press for you to really feel it.
[5726.38 → 5730.42] So I thought that was a valid complaint, and I was right because they fixed it.
[5730.66 → 5732.96] Either way, how would you feel if you were a Nexus 5 owner?
[5733.62 → 5734.62] Actually, kind of gypped.
[5735.02 → 5735.52] Kind of owned.
[5735.62 → 5736.54] Because if I...
[5736.54 → 5737.68] Gypped is actually a bad word.
[5737.74 → 5738.72] You may not even know that.
[5739.22 → 5739.52] No.
[5739.72 → 5741.52] Yeah, because it refers to gypsies.
[5741.52 → 5743.02] It means that they like...
[5743.02 → 5747.40] There's an insane amount of words that are actually terrible, and people use them every
[5747.40 → 5747.54] day.
[5747.60 → 5750.96] Did you know that referring to someone as a young buck is actually disrespectful as well?
[5751.06 → 5754.74] It was like an insult for Native Americans, if I recall correctly.
[5754.74 → 5756.18] Yeah, there's like 10 billion things.
[5756.18 → 5760.44] Someone said that in my grade 10 social studies class, and the teacher flipped out.
[5760.88 → 5762.08] And she had no idea.
[5762.18 → 5763.08] She was like, what?
[5763.98 → 5765.82] And she's like the nicest girl in the world.
[5766.02 → 5767.32] Like one of those just super nice girls.
[5767.32 → 5768.10] Why would she flip out?
[5768.18 → 5769.14] She obviously didn't know.
[5769.14 → 5770.24] I don't...
[5770.24 → 5771.56] He was kind of an interesting guy.
[5771.68 → 5772.10] He was just crazy?
[5772.28 → 5772.42] Yeah.
[5772.58 → 5772.84] All right.
[5773.10 → 5775.16] I'm not going to talk about former teachers on the show.
[5775.34 → 5776.08] They might be watching.
[5776.24 → 5776.78] They probably aren't.
[5776.88 → 5777.22] I would.
[5777.28 → 5778.50] I like a lot of my former teachers.
[5779.56 → 5781.34] Mr. Thompson, Mr. First, Mr. Rattle.
[5782.08 → 5783.40] Probably none of them are watching at all.
[5783.52 → 5783.58] Definitely not.
[5783.58 → 5784.78] Probably none of them are watching at all.
[5784.82 → 5785.52] But that would be awesome.
[5786.16 → 5787.98] Isn't it sad that they don't know how famous you are now?
[5788.16 → 5788.96] Actually, some of them do.
[5789.20 → 5789.50] Do they?
[5789.60 → 5789.80] Oh.
[5790.30 → 5790.56] Cool.
[5790.56 → 5795.54] So the Pirate Bay is going to be making domain names irrelevant.
[5795.78 → 5799.36] They've actually switched domain names twice in a matter of days.
[5799.80 → 5807.68] And their new system is going to allow them to get around domain takedowns by, well, implementing
[5807.68 → 5809.56] the Pirate Bay within its own web browser.
[5810.82 → 5811.30] Whoa.
[5812.14 → 5813.48] I didn't read this topic.
[5813.60 → 5815.36] I just assumed they had some other thing going on.
[5815.52 → 5816.20] That's crazy.
[5816.20 → 5816.42] Nope.
[5816.42 → 5817.14] Crazy.
[5817.14 → 5819.38] So this was posted by Guns Cool on the forum.
[5819.70 → 5823.34] And the original article is from techienews.co.uk.
[5823.78 → 5825.12] I think it's .co.uk.
[5825.32 → 5825.62] I think that's the way the real people say it.
[5825.62 → 5827.20] So I'm assuming the browser will update.
[5827.30 → 5830.34] And then if you type in Pirate Bay, it'll just automatically bring you to whatever the...
[5830.34 → 5830.70] Wow.
[5831.20 → 5834.26] So it says new system will make domain names irrelevant.
[5834.74 → 5836.38] So something, something, something, et cetera.
[5836.46 → 5837.92] I actually don't understand.
[5838.14 → 5840.58] I'm not a web developer or anything like that.
[5840.58 → 5843.34] And I'm not sure exactly how this works.
[5843.34 → 5849.06] But the Pirate Bay has revealed that this switch to Pirate Bay. Pe is a temporary switch.
[5849.38 → 5855.26] The team is working on a BitTorrent-powered browser that will enable users to store and
[5855.26 → 5861.00] share files with other users without requiring a central hosting, thereby eliminating the need
[5861.00 → 5862.40] for domain name completely.
[5862.40 → 5867.86] So the actual sharing of tracker information will be done peer-to-peer in much the same
[5867.86 → 5870.34] way that the file sharing is already done peer-to-peer.
[5870.52 → 5874.16] So there will be no one to go after in theory.
[5874.32 → 5879.06] Could they just use like a lightly modified version of Firefox?
[5879.24 → 5880.96] So quote from the article is,
[5880.96 → 5886.04] Once that is available, all links and sites will be accessible through a perfectly legal
[5886.04 → 5887.38] piece of browser software.
[5887.72 → 5892.74] And the rest of it will be peer-to-peer with no central point to attack via the legal system.
[5892.74 → 5896.20] I think, I don't know if they're going to, but I think they could just lightly modify
[5896.20 → 5902.38] the open source code for Firefox and just like easily have this highly updated, really
[5902.38 → 5903.46] well-performing browser.
[5904.02 → 5905.42] So isn't that fascinating?
[5905.64 → 5906.54] That's smart.
[5907.10 → 5908.96] I don't like, they might be making their own from the ground up.
[5908.96 → 5909.84] I have no idea.
[5909.96 → 5914.54] I haven't read this article, unfortunately, although I'm like super interested now and
[5914.54 → 5915.44] I'm totally going to read it.
[5915.44 → 5916.56] I added this at the last minute.
[5916.66 → 5917.38] I actually didn't tell.
[5917.78 → 5919.66] I was just posting links on my phone.
[5920.26 → 5920.48] I know.
[5920.54 → 5921.28] I saw that coming in.
[5921.34 → 5924.46] I was just focused on editing the other video.
[5925.42 → 5926.44] So that's fascinating, eh?
[5926.68 → 5928.30] That's super crazy.
[5928.42 → 5930.26] Score one for the pirates potentially here.
[5930.38 → 5932.00] Like, how do you get around that?
[5932.06 → 5937.50] Because yeah, it could just be like a button on the browser that is just automatically updated
[5937.50 → 5942.52] and directed to the site or like there's so many, or it doesn't even have to be a website
[5942.52 → 5943.08] at that point.
[5943.48 → 5945.96] The browser could just directly interface with it automatically.
[5946.26 → 5946.44] Yeah.
[5946.56 → 5948.28] Like, holy crap.
[5948.44 → 5948.84] Yeah.
[5949.16 → 5949.46] That's cool.
[5949.50 → 5950.82] Because there's stuff like this.
[5950.90 → 5955.08] There's been like browsing applications, like views, I guess you could technically say,
[5955.14 → 5957.98] but it still interfaces with websites that actually manage everything.
[5957.98 → 5961.72] It's just a browser that accesses those websites.
[5961.90 → 5964.12] This way it would be, oh man.
[5964.36 → 5964.86] Yeah, I know.
[5965.24 → 5966.46] It's like mine.
[5967.46 → 5968.18] Huge deal.
[5968.30 → 5969.22] They just won the game.
[5969.46 → 5969.96] The game.
[5970.52 → 5970.78] Yeah.
[5970.88 → 5971.32] The game.
[5972.08 → 5972.62] For now.
[5973.24 → 5973.66] The game.
[5973.90 → 5974.62] I'm trolling people.
[5974.98 → 5975.78] Oh, all right.
[5976.54 → 5977.10] All right.
[5977.14 → 5977.94] Well, that's it, guys.
[5978.02 → 5980.00] Thank you so much for watching the WAN show.
[5980.10 → 5981.28] I hope you enjoyed it.
[5981.72 → 5983.92] Wow, we're ending somewhat on time today.
[5984.36 → 5985.42] And we started on time.
[5985.84 → 5986.16] Yeah.
[5986.16 → 5990.74] Besides the dropped frames, which hopefully we'll have addressed next week with our new
[5990.74 → 5992.10] fibre optic uplink.
[5992.62 → 5993.06] Yeah.
[5993.46 → 5993.86] Yeah.
[5994.90 → 5996.06] Super stoked for that.
[5996.22 → 5997.12] That's going to be awesome.
[5997.88 → 5999.50] So, take care, guys.
[5999.62 → 6000.66] Thank you again for watching.
[6000.92 → 6002.98] And what do I usually say at the end of this show?
[6003.78 → 6004.98] I think it changes all the time, actually.
[6005.08 → 6005.96] Does it change all the time?
[6005.98 → 6008.72] And then we usually end up talking and then just randomly ending the broadcast.
[6008.96 → 6011.04] Big thanks to our sponsors, Hotspot Shield and Intel.
[6011.04 → 6014.54] And our CES sponsors, who are NCI, Corsair, and Western Digital.
[6015.00 → 6015.92] How long until?
[6015.92 → 6017.72] Someone says unsubbed, unfollowed.
[6018.02 → 6018.98] Well, sorry, man.
[6019.16 → 6020.68] Is it because I forgot what to say at the end?
[6020.94 → 6022.28] How long until CES?
[6022.32 → 6023.14] Is it a month?
[6023.30 → 6023.96] Less than a month.
[6024.26 → 6024.82] Like three weeks?
[6024.82 → 6025.68] Yeah, it's coming up on like the third.
[6025.74 → 6026.46] Yeah, it's like three weeks.
[6026.54 → 6027.04] We're going to die.
[6028.18 → 6029.10] Oh, my God.
[6029.16 → 6029.74] Peace out, everyone.
[6029.84 → 6030.44] Okay, bye.
[6031.60 → 6032.38] Oh, what the?
[6032.70 → 6033.28] Oh, what?
[6035.16 → 6036.12] Come on.
[6036.34 → 6037.56] Oh, that means that...
[6037.56 → 6038.44] It's not done.
[6038.92 → 6040.68] Is the volume even going to be right?
[6041.16 → 6042.60] What are you talking about?
[6042.60 → 6045.42] I'm putting on our intro thing.
[6046.00 → 6047.72] Oh, the volume's not going to be right.
[6047.80 → 6048.94] Can you just play the other scene?
[6049.42 → 6050.14] I don't think...
[6050.14 → 6050.70] Is it in there?
[6051.10 → 6051.90] No, you moved it.
[6052.06 → 6053.70] No, I moved it from this one.
[6053.78 → 6054.50] I think we're done here.
[6054.82 → 6055.14] Okay.
[6055.14 → 6055.22] Okay.
[6059.10 → 6059.90] Okay.
[6061.58 → 6062.20] Okay.
[6066.50 → 6066.92] Okay.
