[0.00 → 5.00] Welcome to the WAN Show, guys. The show where every week we have technical
[5.00 → 9.12] difficulties out the Yazoo. In fact, our mic isn't even positioned correctly
[9.12 → 13.62] anymore because we just scorched over on the couch. Ah, that's okay, Brandon's
[13.62 → 19.24] coming back in to fix it for us. The audio setup's gonna work perfectly. Yeah, I know, right?
[19.24 → 22.56] But it's okay, we have a compressor now, so at least when I get all like
[22.56 → 26.48] excitable about things, it's not going to be like, oh, we're all like, crap, Linus is
[26.48 → 29.04] talking way too loud, but then when he talks quietly you may actually be able
[29.04 → 33.54] to hear him. So we've got some great topics today. Number one is that Corsair
[33.54 → 39.92] and Cherry have co-announced multicolour back... individually multicolour RGB
[39.92 → 45.00] backlit Cherry MX mechanical key switches. Sweet. So that's going to be a Corsair
[45.00 → 49.04] exclusive at the beginning, at least, but we'll see what happens. I mean, that was...
[49.04 → 52.44] that's a hilarious one to me. I mean, maybe they threw some money into
[52.44 → 56.40] developing it or... It must have been. ...something like that, because there are bigger mechanical
[56.40 → 62.40] keyboard guys than Corsair by... A lot. A lot, but there you go, exclusivity for at
[62.40 → 66.72] least a little while. DisplayPort 1.3 is being talked about, so we're going to see a
[66.72 → 71.04] bandwidth increase from something along the lines of 5.4 gigabit per second in
[71.04 → 76.44] DisplayPort 1.2 to 8.1 gigabit per second in DisplayPort 1.3, which is going to
[76.44 → 82.44] enable 4K resolution displays and all kinds of other cool stuff. Up to 8K.
[82.44 → 88.12] Up to... Did I say 4K? Yeah. Because I meant 8K. So once again, HDMI is playing catch up. Our
[88.12 → 93.40] special guest today is Barnacles. So he's a fellow YouTuber. I'm just going to go ahead and
[93.40 → 97.48] throw the little lower third on there, so there's like glasses on him or something. Easel made this
[97.48 → 103.96] lower third to make him happy or something. All right, what else we got for... what else we got for
[103.96 → 109.48] topics this week? OCT was bought out by Toshiba in a deal that was... Bought everything. That was
[109.48 → 113.88] worth slightly more than just OCT buying the Inclines controller, which is interesting. Yeah.
[114.60 → 118.92] And we're going to discuss the possible end of AMD FX processors again. Possible?
[120.52 → 132.92] Possible. All right, welcome to the show, guys.
[133.96 → 153.32] All right, guys. So our sponsor this week is Squarespace. So you can head over to
[153.32 → 160.28] Squarespace.com slash Linus. Squarespace is the easy way to create your own website and if you use
[160.28 → 166.36] our offer code, which is Linus12, then you can get yourself 10% off your own Squarespace website.
[166.36 → 171.72] So they handle the hosting, they handle the creation tools, and you don't have to do it the simple
[171.72 → 175.48] way. You can actually just take one of their templates. They have tons of templates that are
[175.48 → 181.16] ideal for things like blog stores or community sort of portals and all kinds of cool stuff like that.
[181.16 → 185.72] And then you can even dive into the HTML and the CSS and you can play around with it and customize it to
[185.72 → 192.28] your heart's content. They have very scalable plans. And in fact, LinusMediaGroup.com is hosted on one.
[192.28 → 197.72] It's a very inexpensive one. But when we get hit really hard with a ton of traffic, then it's all good as well.
[197.72 → 199.72] One quick second. Did you say Linus11?
[199.72 → 204.20] I just said 12. Okay, okay. Because it should be 12. Someone just said Linus11 in chat. So let's
[204.20 → 211.08] just make sure. It's Linus12. Yeah, Linus12 and my height in inches. I didn't bring that part up.
[211.08 → 215.80] I didn't bring that part up at all. Yeah, well, it was there. It was there. So let's jump into our
[215.80 → 222.84] first topic of the day, Cherry MX RGB keyboards. This is something that I'm sure there are at least two
[222.84 → 228.28] people in this room that are excited about. So the original article that we tracked down here was
[228.28 → 237.56] on Hexes. And look at that. Looking at that hurts my brain because of where the W is. Well, that's about,
[237.56 → 243.24] well, it's kind of close, somewhat close. Close-in. It hurts. Yeah. Okay. It's wrong.
[245.16 → 251.80] So guys, the W should probably be more like about here with a slight overlap on the A and the S line
[251.80 → 257.16] right here. So it should be slightly overlapping the A. But you know what? It's okay because the news
[257.16 → 261.32] is good enough that I'm willing to let this one slide. I think it's, I think it's all good. So
[261.32 → 267.96] we're going to be looking at individual RGB LED lighting inside every single key switch. Now,
[268.68 → 272.76] I'm going to play devil's advocate here for a moment. And I'm going to talk about what could be
[272.76 → 279.48] negative about this. Okay. I've already run into quite a few situations with individually backlit
[279.48 → 284.92] Cherry MX keyboards that have a single backlight go out. And then all of a sudden the keyboard is
[284.92 → 290.36] now useless. Now think about this in terms of RMA rates, something with a defective rate of less
[290.36 → 296.28] than 1% is pretty darn good. That's really, perfect. Yes, that's perfect. So you look at PS4.
[296.28 → 299.56] Okay. So they had the HDMI issue, but then they came out, and they're like, okay, well, hold on a second.
[299.56 → 305.80] It's only like 0.4% of units, which is actually, it's actually good. That's solid. Okay.
[305.80 → 313.40] Okay. So a typical keyboard has 104 keys, meaning it will have approximately 100 backlights. And then
[313.40 → 319.88] if we go RGB on that, that means every keyboard, what just happened? That means every keyboard is
[319.88 → 326.52] going to have 300 backlights is, which means the chance of something being wrong with your keyboard
[326.52 → 330.68] is extremely high. Now you could go, okay, well, hold on a second line. This membrane keyboards have had
[330.68 → 336.84] RGB lighting for ages, but the way that they do it is different. They do it in zones or across the
[336.84 → 343.64] whole keyboard with a few LEDs below and then a diffuser layer. So maybe this reduces issues.
[344.52 → 351.56] If there are three LEDs, you lose a third of your possible colours. What if you lose two of your LEDs?
[351.56 → 360.84] I would like to say that that was not me. I take no responsibility for what just happened.
[362.84 → 365.72] But then you can't maybe have your favourite colour.
[365.72 → 370.52] But then, okay. Are you willing to RMA a keyboard once if it means you can have RGB backlighting on
[370.52 → 373.00] your mechanical keyboard? What?
[373.00 → 376.36] Like if you were like, okay, well, there's a good chance I'm just going to have to-
[376.36 → 377.40] Like in comparison to RB?
[377.40 → 380.60] In comparison to just not having any customization.
[380.60 → 381.24] Any backlighting at all?
[381.24 → 385.64] Yeah, just single colour. Like, are you willing to take that risk? It's like, I'm going to pay a bunch
[385.64 → 390.68] extra. It might be defective, but dammit, I want it. I want that RGB backlighting.
[390.68 → 392.20] What? Oh, you mean when you're buying-
[392.20 → 394.20] Yeah, like when you're making the decision to buy it.
[394.76 → 399.48] Because you said, would you be willing to RMA your keyboard? And I was like, yeah.
[400.20 → 404.20] Yeah, it's okay. So if, would you be willing to take the risk of getting a defective one if
[404.20 → 406.68] that meant that you could have like this awesome new feature?
[407.80 → 411.56] I don't think there's going to be very many defective ones. So yes, probably.
[411.56 → 418.84] Okay. All right. So it's coming in a variety of Cherry MX key switch flavours. I kind of freaked
[418.84 → 421.24] out because when I saw the Corsair press announcement-
[421.24 → 422.20] You only see red, right?
[422.20 → 428.52] They only had this one. I sent like the most distressed email ever to our Corsair PR contact.
[428.52 → 433.48] I was like, dude, um, hey.
[433.48 → 435.56] Did you send them that survey thing?
[435.56 → 441.56] Yeah, I did. I sent it. So there was a thing on the mechanical keyboard Subreddit that was like,
[441.56 → 447.00] what's your favourite Cherry MX switch? And red was like, tiny little. The problem with that though,
[447.00 → 447.80] is it's-
[447.80 → 449.72] It's really, it's a specific audience.
[449.72 → 453.64] It's a small sample size, and it's a specific audience because Cherry MX reds are marketed to
[453.64 → 457.72] gamers. I don't think gamers are sitting around in our mechanical keyboards.
[459.08 → 460.04] They're playing games.
[460.04 → 463.56] There's definitely some, but, but it is, it is a specific audience.
[463.56 → 465.32] And they voted for Cherry MX red.
[466.04 → 469.40] And it's not a yeah, yeah, that's a good point. And it's not a it's yeah,
[469.40 → 471.16] it's not a broad audience, and it's not a perfect survey.
[471.16 → 475.00] See, and I saw this image too. And I was like, what? That's the only one clear.
[475.00 → 480.36] So how would the transparent cases, how the LEDs are going to, anyway, I was freaking out,
[480.36 → 485.16] but everything's good. So we're going to see it integrated on different key switch types. It is
[485.16 → 492.36] going to be Corsair exclusive for an undisclosed period of time. Um, which I'm okay with because
[492.36 → 497.88] as much as Corsair might not be as big of a player in keyboards as they are in something like memory or
[497.88 → 502.92] power supplies. I don't have any complaints about their mechanical keyboards. K70s are pretty sweet.
[502.92 → 509.16] K70 is pretty sweet. We actually just got some Cherry MX brown K70s, and they are a big hit with
[509.16 → 512.68] everyone in the office. I wasn't a huge fan of K60s. I think you know that.
[512.68 → 517.32] Yeah. Oh, I wasn't a big fan of the K60 either. It's Cherry MX red only, which neither of us are
[517.32 → 523.96] no particularly fond of. And it had some issues with a BIOS detection. And so that's all solved with
[523.96 → 528.04] the K70, and they have additional switch types. You know, I talked to Corsair about it and this was
[528.04 → 532.60] fascinating because they were like, I was like, okay, well, hold on with the RGB ones, you guys are going to
[532.60 → 538.12] have like lots of key switches types, right? And he's like, well, okay, Linus, think about this.
[538.12 → 544.44] Okay. We've got different bodies, right? Some people got big bodies. Some people got slim bodies,
[544.44 → 549.24] sexy bodies. Okay. The keyboard bodies. Sorry. So they have different keyboard layouts, 104 key. They
[549.24 → 555.32] got the short one. That's the K65, I think something like that. They've got the K95, which is the big
[555.32 → 562.84] deluxe one. So they got bodies. Then they got regional. So does everyone else. Keep going.
[564.60 → 569.72] Then they got regional differences. So they're going to have different layouts. Then they've got key
[569.72 → 576.20] switches. Then, I mean, some, some keyboard companies start adding backlight colours. And then all of a
[576.20 → 582.60] sudden you got like, what is essentially like a keyboard at the end of the day, and you've got,
[582.60 → 588.92] you know, 300 skews. So I'm like, okay, so you're going to have like the RGB version and the not RGB
[588.92 → 592.76] version, and you're going to have the brown and the black and the red and the green and the clear and
[592.76 → 597.40] the I don't know, the you don't need all of those. They're not even doing it on all those. They're only
[597.40 → 601.88] doing it on four. So they wouldn't have green and clear. Okay, fine. But the point is that you're going to
[601.88 → 605.72] end up with a lot of skews and I understand why we don't necessarily get to have our cake and eat
[605.72 → 609.96] it too. So we're going to see what skews they come out with. We are definitely having a look at this
[609.96 → 615.24] at CES. I don't know if I told you this, but we are the very first press booking in Corsair Suite.
[615.24 → 620.68] Nice. Nice. I, you, you probably saw my note. So we are definitely, oh, and yes, I will be going.
[620.68 → 625.08] Yeah. So this was, this was on, this was on Luke's notes for, uh, for this actually,
[625.08 → 630.20] I'm just going to, I'll screen share with you guys here. Check this out. So, uh, control plus,
[630.20 → 635.72] plus, plus, plus, plus, plus. Okay. I'm sure Linus will check these at CES. Grumble,
[635.72 → 641.64] grumble, grumble. And I'm totally going to send him to like, I don't know, Fante at the same time.
[641.64 → 646.04] Mind you, they may have some cool stuff on display. They reached out to me today. So I'll, I'll, uh,
[646.04 → 650.28] I'll set that up with you. Yeah. But still, we got to get samples. I want to see these.
[650.28 → 654.28] I'm definitely doing the course. You know, what's funny is I asked Corsair. I was like,
[654.28 → 659.48] whatever demo one you guys are showing off at the show, can I just like take it after the show? We'll do like,
[659.48 → 663.24] we'll do like really nice glam footage of it and everything. We just want to play with it.
[663.24 → 670.84] And he's like, um, no, he's like, yeah, that one is pretty Frankenstein. It's going to have like,
[670.84 → 675.56] it's exactly what I want. It's going to have like a modded, like power adapter. And it's good. It's
[675.56 → 681.08] like they took a completely different keyboard and like hand modded it. Speaking of hand modded,
[681.08 → 684.84] uh, my G sync monitor has arrived, which I haven't had a chance to play games on yet,
[684.84 → 688.76] but I'm going to this weekend for sure. I've seen a bunch of spam in the chat about
[688.76 → 695.24] your G sync thing. Yeah. I'm going to this weekend for sure. And, uh, the G sync monitor is so bad
[695.24 → 700.52] ass. Like it is, it is the most, one of the most engineering sample things that I have ever gotten.
[700.52 → 705.80] That is unlisted. Please change that to public. Thank you. It is one of the most engineering sample
[705.80 → 710.36] things I've ever received. So it says prototype on a sticker on the back. Okay. Like it's an ASUS monitor
[710.36 → 715.32] and it's like prototype on the back. And then you flip it onto the back, and it has like, um,
[715.32 → 720.76] it has like an Nvidia vinyl wrap on it. That's obviously designed for show use. Like it has,
[720.76 → 724.84] they wouldn't send that to a reviewer like that because reviewers don't care what the back of a
[724.84 → 731.16] monitor looks like. Okay. And then you look at the bottom of it and the inputs, like the DVI and VGA
[731.16 → 737.32] and HDMI inputs are just gone. Like the holes are there, but they just rip them out because it only
[737.32 → 743.64] supports G sync over display port. And then the power plug is just gone. And it comes with like
[743.64 → 749.64] this random, like huge power brick. And then just has like a DC jack in the middle of the AC,
[749.64 → 757.72] like large receptacle. I'm just like, wow, that's cool. I love it. Um, apparently we're dropping a
[757.72 → 761.80] few frames. I'm not sure what the deal is with that, but, uh, hopefully, hopefully you guys can,
[761.80 → 765.24] can endure. Yeah. It's not, it's not a ton. It's not too many. Um,
[766.04 → 770.36] all right. So let's move on to our next topic here. This was actually something that was talked
[770.36 → 776.60] about a little while ago. So let's go ahead and screen share here. Uh, so the article here is from
[776.60 → 787.64] legit reviews, and it's ECS to begin making ASUS motherboards now. Okay. That might sound a lot
[787.64 → 797.32] crazier than it actually is. So what's up? Hmm. What's up? Nothing. Uh, we're lagging a little bit.
[797.32 → 802.36] What's up? We're good. Okay. Uh, so that might actually sound a lot crazier than it actually
[802.36 → 808.84] is because something a lot of people don't know about ECS is that they are, or at least they were,
[808.84 → 815.88] not that long ago, still considered a tier one manufacturer, not because their retail business,
[815.88 → 821.72] like their retail ECS boards sold particularly well, or frankly, were particularly good,
[821.72 → 827.72] but because as far as just contract manufacturing goes, there was nothing wrong with ECS.
[828.28 → 835.64] They know how to put capacitors on a PCB and keep RMA rates low and manufacture something and put it in
[835.64 → 842.44] a box for you and produce it. So, so they would do a lot of OEM manufacturing, whereas their retail
[842.44 → 851.16] branded stuff just really wasn't that important. Um, so what? Oh, okay. Whatever. Um, so yes,
[851.16 → 855.72] we know it's old news, but I just wanted to clarify because some people were kind of freaking out
[855.72 → 860.52] because they're like, Oh, holy cow. Asus's quality is going to go down. Asus's engineering will still be
[860.52 → 864.60] excellent. The only reason for them to do this is just that they're, they want to
[865.32 → 871.00] extend their ability to have things manufactured beyond just Megatron. So I don't know if you guys
[871.00 → 876.04] know this, but Asus and Megatron used to be the same company, and they split, whereas Asus is the
[876.04 → 881.40] branding and engineering and marketing. And then Megatron was a spinoff that is pure manufacturing.
[881.40 → 889.48] Pegasus. Yeah. Yeah. So Megatron wants to be able to take business from guys who otherwise might be Asus
[889.48 → 893.48] competitors. And they don't want to give Asus a bunch of money so they can manufacture through
[893.48 → 898.20] Megatron and then Asus wants to manufacture through Megatron and someone else. But then MSI and Gigabyte
[898.20 → 903.16] with all the history there are not going to want to manufacture anything for Asus. That's not going
[903.16 → 908.68] to happen. So it looks like ECS with their much weaker retail business doesn't view Asus as the
[908.68 → 914.12] same kind of competition that Gigabyte and MSI do. So that's where all of that comes, comes down to.
[914.12 → 918.84] I'm still kind of surprised that we see a lot of stuff. I love this. I love this chat.
[918.84 → 925.64] I'm paid by Nvidia. Sure. For what? I don't know. I'm paid by Nvidia. Has Nvidia ever given us money?
[925.64 → 929.24] No. Actually, the one time Nvidia gave us money, this is kind of a funny story.
[929.24 → 932.60] They gave us money? Yeah. Yeah. The one time Nvidia gave us money. Oh, no, they did. They ran some
[932.60 → 937.16] pre-rolls like early in the year, but it wasn't, it wasn't very much. Oh. The one, the one time in the
[937.16 → 943.24] last six months that they've given us money was actually when we got our sample of GTX 780 and I
[943.24 → 948.60] got dinged with import duties at the door, and they told me they'd reimburse me, and it took them like
[948.60 → 954.04] three months, and they finally gave me like cash because they couldn't figure out how to send me
[954.04 → 959.00] money because I'm not set up properly in their system. So that's how much money Nvidia gives me,
[959.00 → 963.56] $70. Well, no, because you had to spend that much money to get that much money. Yes.
[963.56 → 967.56] That's like saying you went to the casino with 20 bucks and came out with 20 bucks, and you made $20.
[967.56 → 977.00] Yes. So, so Nvidia gives us money. Um, all right, let's go ahead and oh man, my thing is like super
[977.00 → 981.80] zoomed in now. We can do a really quick topic. Yeah, let's do a bunch of them. We have a whole
[981.80 → 987.08] lot of those. We can recover the Dell 24-inch monitors. Yeah, the Dell 24-inch monitor. Where is that?
[987.08 → 992.52] So while he finds it, the Dell 24-inch 4k monitor that we talked about last stream that was like
[992.52 → 997.96] super, super top of the line baller and didn't have a price released has had its price release.
[997.96 → 1003.64] It'll be $1,400, and they also released information about two other models. That's awesome because I
[1003.64 → 1007.08] actually thought it might be more than that. Um, they released information about two other models,
[1007.08 → 1014.60] one of which is a 28-inch version, which is not the ultra sharp kind of class monitor that the 24 inches,
[1014.60 → 1019.96] um, but it's still a 4k model, and it's in 28 inches. That'll be a thousand dollars,
[1019.96 → 1024.12] even cheaper than the 24 inch. I'm actually not interested in that one at all. I still,
[1024.12 → 1027.48] I still want the elder. If I'm going to drop a thousand dollars on a monitor,
[1027.48 → 1032.76] then I'm going to drop 1400 on one that doesn't suck. I don't think it'll suck, but it won't be
[1032.76 → 1037.64] ultra sharp. It's TN. Is it TN? Didn't you say it was TN? Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on,
[1037.64 → 1042.76] hold on, hold on. All I knew was that it wasn't an ultra sharp. Oh, okay. I thought you had told me it was TN. Okay.
[1042.76 → 1047.16] If it's not TN, then maybe we're, maybe we can still talk. I'm not entirely sure what it is.
[1047.16 → 1050.68] Because if it was like a TN thousand dollar monitor, then that's just ridiculous. I mean,
[1050.68 → 1055.88] if it's VA or something, then, then we'll talk. Um, and then there's a 32-inch model that is still
[1055.88 → 1063.00] an ultra sharp model, which is $3,500. But like, yeah, it's a 32 inch 4k. Oh, I'm so excited. It's
[1063.00 → 1069.88] been so long since Dell has flexed their, uh, flexed their muscles in terms of, you know, leading the
[1069.88 → 1073.96] market and monitors. And I'm really, really excited about this. So this was posted by you
[1073.96 → 1079.24] better not on the forum. And honestly, the 24 inch at 1400, it makes sense that that's the one
[1079.24 → 1083.80] that they leaked and started talking to talking about, because that's the one that I'm extremely
[1083.80 → 1090.76] excited about. It's still too much. I'm not buying in, but it's, it's in that range where I'll see
[1090.76 → 1096.28] people start doing it. And like, it's in the range where maybe we can start getting 4k benchmarks
[1096.28 → 1100.20] sooner than I thought we might be like, maybe not this monitor, but there's probably going to be
[1100.20 → 1104.92] competitors and stuff. Because it's been kind of hilarious for a while where it's just like
[1105.48 → 1110.92] monitors have gone from being valuable and important to just being this totally commodity,
[1110.92 → 1116.84] just like crappy, stupid thing. But it wasn't that long ago that people invested in like high end
[1116.84 → 1124.20] gamers invested in high-end monitors. Now I think that someone somewhere expected 4k at 3000 plus
[1124.20 → 1127.96] dollars to be that thing again. Yeah. But that was never going to happen. I mean,
[1127.96 → 1132.52] I remember having a conversation with AMD where they were saying, well, 290X is designed for 4k.
[1132.52 → 1137.56] And you know, we think that someone buying this card will buy a 4k monitor. I was like, well, no,
[1138.20 → 1141.40] they'll buy that card, and then they'll run it on their 1080p monitor, their two and a half K
[1141.40 → 1147.24] monitor until they can afford a 4k monitor. And I think a thousand dollars plus or minus is that magic
[1147.24 → 1151.56] price point where someone will do it. Someone will do it. The guy with the crazy desk PC that has a
[1151.56 → 1156.52] thousand dollars worth of liquid cooling in it, we'll probably do it. Yeah. It's, it's not like,
[1156.52 → 1161.08] I'm not going to see too many of these in build logs except for like the crazy ones. Yeah. But at
[1161.08 → 1165.40] least it'll show up in a build log. I still haven't seen a build log with a 4k monitor. No. At all.
[1165.40 → 1173.00] Um, I love the PC master race idea. I love Reddit slash PC master race, whatever. But, uh, the
[1173.00 → 1179.80] the rah, rah 4k that goes on a lot there is not really a thing too much. Well, I, okay, hold on. I,
[1179.80 → 1184.28] I don't necessarily agree with that because I think that we're going to have the availability
[1184.28 → 1186.76] and it's going to be the option and the console is going to stay the same forever. Yes. We're
[1186.76 → 1191.72] going to have an option way sooner than the console guys. The only thing I don't like in it is the
[1191.72 → 1197.32] I'm over here running 4k while you run your 720p. Well, no, you're probably not. That's like saying,
[1197.32 → 1202.68] I'm over here running Oculus when you're not yet. Oculus is coming, and it's going to be amazing,
[1202.68 → 1207.80] but it's not actually there yet. Yeah. But like it's coming. We will have the option. That is very cool.
[1207.80 → 1215.32] Yeah. All about the option. Oh, and it has a built-in card reader. Hooray. I actually kind of like that.
[1215.88 → 1222.68] Um, there doesn't seem to be any word on whether it will support a single display port cable driving
[1222.68 → 1229.40] the entire thing. But to be clear, guys, display port 1.3 does have enough bandwidth for 4k over one
[1229.40 → 1235.24] cable, but the so far the ASUS and the Sharp models require two cables, and then they're using like a goofy,
[1235.24 → 1243.00] um, split down the middle and tiled monitor sort of implementation that really just isn't as good
[1243.00 → 1248.84] as having the whole panel be one thing. So I really hope that this one, so it says it has HDMI in
[1248.84 → 1254.12] display port and mini display port inputs. And I hope that with display port and mini display port,
[1254.12 → 1259.56] it's able to just take a single input for the full 4k. Oh, so exciting. All right. Let's do maybe
[1259.56 → 1264.44] one more quick one, and then we'll bring on a barnacle. Sure. Uh, what quick one do you want to
[1264.44 → 1271.08] do? Let's do console sales. Holy balls. Well, particularly PS4. So PS4 beat out the fastest
[1271.08 → 1278.44] selling console in the UK, which used to be the PSP at 185,000 in 48 hours, and they got 250,000 plus,
[1279.40 → 1287.24] which is like pretty beast. And that was 66% higher than Xbox One at 150,000. I fully, I mean, when I was,
[1287.24 → 1293.72] when I was looking this up, I fully didn't expect the PS4 to be beating it. I was, I was unsure. And
[1293.72 → 1301.72] then that scale is insane. Oh, God!. I was sitting here while you were talking. I wasn't even listening
[1301.72 → 1308.12] to you at all. I was just trying to figure out a way to say that. Um, so anyway, the PS4 has not only
[1308.12 → 1314.52] sold more within 48 hours than the PSP did in the UK, in the UK, in the UK, in the UK, just to be clear,
[1314.52 → 1317.96] we're talking UK numbers. It has sold more than Wii U lifetime.
[1317.96 → 1325.80] Uh, that number being at 2.1 million units as of December 1st.
[1325.80 → 1330.76] Again in the UK, which is just such a, such a sad thing, such a very sad thing.
[1332.20 → 1336.28] Pretty, pretty ridiculous. I don't know if that 2.1 million unit one is as of UK.
[1336.28 → 1341.64] I mean, honestly, the thing about the thing about the thing about the PlayStation 4 is that it
[1341.64 → 1348.20] actually represents a fairly compelling value. I mean, we're not huge console gamers by any
[1348.20 → 1351.24] stretch of the imagination at all. We're not console gamers by any stretch of the imagination.
[1351.24 → 1359.00] I know, but, but we did our console image quality comparison, and we did play around with the image
[1359.00 → 1365.48] quality of a PC versus Xbox One versus PS4 versus Xbox 360. And I think you and I both agreed that
[1365.48 → 1368.44] PlayStation 4 came out as a pretty reasonable value.
[1368.44 → 1372.04] Yeah. The same thing though, is that computer that we had was upgradeable.
[1372.04 → 1375.72] Yeah. Oh, I mean, there's all the usual PC arguments, but then there's all the usual
[1375.72 → 1381.16] console arguments. Well, okay, but I can get resistance or okay, but I can just put a disc
[1381.16 → 1384.52] in it and I can sit down on my couch and I can play. After you wait for the download.
[1384.52 → 1388.04] After you wait for the download and the patch. I mean, it's amazing how much more like PC
[1388.04 → 1391.88] gaming consoles becoming all the time, like every day.
[1391.88 → 1395.40] When we're doing those image quality comparison, I'd be like, all right, we're going to move to the
[1395.40 → 1399.40] next console, put the disc in. Oh, I have to wait for like a huge download.
[1401.16 → 1403.24] It's like, oh, no way.
[1403.24 → 1408.84] Absolutely brilliant. So, oh my goodness. I didn't change the title of the show.
[1408.84 → 1410.04] Pre-show test stream.
[1410.84 → 1415.24] When show live now.
[1415.88 → 1420.20] That's probably, oh, and I'm playing Assassin's Creed apparently, which I'm not playing.
[1420.20 → 1422.92] All right. So let's go ahead and let's bring in Barnacles, shall we?
[1422.92 → 1424.20] All right. Give me one quick second.
[1424.20 → 1425.08] All right. Awesome.
[1425.08 → 1426.44] It looks like he's ready to go.
[1426.44 → 1428.84] I'm going to go ahead and change over our lower third here.
[1429.72 → 1430.12] Boom.
[1430.76 → 1432.92] Oh, he told me to that the title was wrong.
[1433.16 → 1434.68] Hi, Barnacles. Welcome to the show.
[1435.56 → 1436.84] I feel welcome. Thanks, guys.
[1437.48 → 1443.96] Awesome. So, why don't you take just a moment here and explain to the nice viewers what exactly you do
[1443.96 → 1449.24] and how they can find you if they like your appearance on the show today and they actually
[1449.24 → 1451.08] want to hear you say more things, but no pressure.
[1453.32 → 1456.20] All right. Well, this should be pretty easy and straightforward. Guys, I've been a software
[1456.20 → 1460.60] developer at Microsoft for 15 years. That's my official day job. I also dabble in some
[1461.48 → 1465.48] offline development with Opulent Studios, a little side company I have developed for Windows Phone.
[1466.20 → 1470.68] But my hobby and what I'm really passionate about is creating YouTube videos. So, I've been doing
[1470.68 → 1475.00] that for about two years now. I've been having a hell of a time with it. But huge tech enthusiast.
[1475.00 → 1478.44] If you guys don't know who I am, go ahead and check me out. I'm over at BarnNerd.com,
[1478.44 → 1482.92] like a barn where you put your cows and your horses and nerd will figure that one out.
[1482.92 → 1488.44] But I have a lot of fun with the YouTube thing. It's just amazing the people that you find online
[1488.44 → 1491.40] and the people you encounter, especially like Linus and Slick here. I mean,
[1491.40 → 1495.40] there's a hell of a lot of nerds out there. And I'm honoured to be on the show, guys.
[1496.20 → 1501.08] Cool. Well, welcome. I think probably the first thing for us to do is kick off
[1501.08 → 1508.68] with our first guest topic here. So, that is DisplayPort 1.3 is coming. So, let's go ahead and
[1508.68 → 1514.68] show the nice viewers what we got here. This was posted by cDNA on the forum who says,
[1514.68 → 1519.24] I just came across this article. The original article is from Bright Side of News. So, we're going to go
[1519.24 → 1526.20] ahead and make sure we're giving credit where credit is due here. Boom. But there's a lot of
[1526.20 → 1531.40] extremely exciting stuff to share about DisplayPort 1.3, but because Slick has it on his screen and
[1531.40 → 1535.56] I have mine covered up by this article, he's going to go ahead and tell you the bullet points here.
[1535.56 → 1541.16] So, a lot of this is speculation and rumour, Ada, Ada, Ada, but it's maybe coming in quarter two of 2014.
[1541.16 → 1547.80] You're able to push 8K resolutions and 3D 4K. There's going to be some limits in like cable size
[1547.80 → 1551.24] and you might need repeaters if you want to go. Cable length, to be clear. Cable length, sorry.
[1551.24 → 1555.64] And you might need repeaters if you want to go very far at all. And they're unknown if it's going to be
[1555.64 → 1560.04] the same connector. So, there are a few things going around there, but we're seeing bit rates going up
[1560.04 → 1567.88] for 5.4 gigabits per second in DisplayPort 1.2. Now, we're in DisplayPort 1.3, so it's 8.1 gigabits per
[1567.88 → 1573.00] second, which is pretty beast. You'll notice that unlike 1.1 to 1.2, where we saw like a doubling
[1573.00 → 1577.32] in performance, isn't quite a doubling? And that's because we might be getting close to the
[1577.32 → 1583.48] limits of copper bandwidth. And you had something to show for that? No, not really. You had the link
[1583.48 → 1589.08] to Larry's USB cable. Oh, oh, let me find that. Okay, so Barnacles, let's hear your take on why is
[1589.08 → 1595.56] HDMI even a thing anymore? Like, why? So, we've got royalty-free DisplayPort. I think I just heard him
[1595.56 → 1599.32] say he doesn't care about the DisplayPort thing, so he might be noticing. I don't have a DisplayPort,
[1599.32 → 1607.48] my fancy new projector, and I don't even have a 4k display yet. So, it's like 8k isn't terribly
[1607.48 → 1611.24] useful to me at this point. I mean, at some point it might become relevant, but I find it, you know,
[1611.24 → 1615.32] funny that people are already speculating about the next version of DisplayPort being able to support 8k,
[1615.32 → 1619.16] when it's like, I can't even buy a 4k screen right now without like emptying my wallet and doing,
[1619.16 → 1624.76] you know, a broke dance. Okay, well, let's talk about this then. Let's talk about not necessarily how
[1624.76 → 1633.24] superior DisplayPort is. Let's talk about how inferior and crappy HDMI is because HDMI is holding us back
[1633.24 → 1640.76] now, whereas DisplayPort has been capable of the things that we have now for a long time. So, okay,
[1641.56 → 1646.84] let's say you can't afford a 4k display. Can you afford one of those Korean 2.5k displays that are
[1646.84 → 1653.96] like 300 bucks? Oh, absolutely. I got one sitting right in front of me. Right. HDMI, no Buenos,
[1653.96 → 1660.36] because you can only handle 1080 60p, whereas DisplayPort has been able to handle that and 4k
[1660.36 → 1666.60] for a long time now. I think the thing that I am happy about here is the fact that DisplayPort is
[1666.60 → 1673.80] still pushing forward, whereas HDMI 2.0 is also still coming, not released yet. And it pushed to like,
[1673.80 → 1682.28] where we're at. And it's catching up. It's like, okay, well, we can do 4k 60p now. And that is it.
[1682.28 → 1689.08] That is all. Don't worry about the future. We will have HDMI 6 or something. We're not sure what to do.
[1690.12 → 1694.52] Well, no, I think that's a fair assessment. I think that, you know, HDMI does have some serious
[1694.52 → 1700.36] limitations. But for me personally, I mean, where HDMI isn't a factor that I can use, you know, I usually just
[1700.36 → 1705.72] revert back over to DV because it's usually on my computer. It's not like my entertainment system's 4k yet.
[1706.28 → 1711.08] And also, I just like the compatibility of it. I mean, not all my devices have DisplayPort on it. I mean,
[1711.08 → 1715.88] it's actually kind of a rarity on some of the stuff. I think once it becomes more mainstream and everything
[1715.88 → 1719.40] has it, you know, it'll be something that I accept a little bit more. But chances are, when they come out
[1719.40 → 1723.00] the next version, it's just going to probably have a different connector on it, too. Hopefully it doesn't.
[1723.00 → 1726.12] Please make a different connector. I'm getting sick of that with the whole USB thing.
[1726.84 → 1732.28] Yeah. I hope not, too. I mean, if it's still a copper cable, I would hope it's still the same
[1732.28 → 1736.68] connector. The only time I, the only reason I can see for them to move to a different connector would
[1736.68 → 1744.12] be if they want it to not be interoperable. Like if they move to an optical cable or something like
[1744.12 → 1749.96] that, or, or if they have to have, you know, an active cable, and then they need a new connector
[1749.96 → 1754.36] that had specifically powers the active cable that... That's part of the reason why they think it might
[1754.36 → 1760.28] be a different connector is because to get beyond these probably short lengths, they might need
[1760.28 → 1763.96] something else going on, which is why, which is why there might be... There's always something,
[1763.96 → 1769.64] right? With that said, we've got Thunderbolt 20 gigabit, and those are active cables that don't
[1769.64 → 1773.96] necessarily require... A different... A different connector, but it was probably designed for that
[1773.96 → 1780.04] in the first place, so it's hard to say. We'll see. It's still like, maybe coming in Q2 2014,
[1780.04 → 1785.64] and everything here is rumours, but like, pretty accurate. Well, I'll tell you one thing. If the
[1785.64 → 1789.16] rumour is true, if the rumour is true, and they actually do produce the 8K technology, and we
[1789.16 → 1793.24] actually start seeing some 8K native panels coming out, all it can do is push down the cost of 4K,
[1793.24 → 1797.32] and I'm all for that. I'm all for that. Let them make all the 8Ks stay if they want. I mean,
[1797.32 → 1801.16] as long as it drives 4K down into a realm where now I can go get a 4K projector, and it doesn't cost
[1801.16 → 1806.68] $20,000, hey, rock on. I'm happy. You know, it's a perfect point you're making about 4K projector,
[1806.68 → 1812.84] because 4K is one of those things where for the desktop PC, I feel like it makes sense, because
[1812.84 → 1819.00] you can really use the extra real estate, and the extra pixel perfect clarity on text. Really,
[1819.00 → 1825.48] that's what it's about to me, because I find for gaming, 2560 by 1600 is a really great experience.
[1825.48 → 1831.80] You throw 2X antialiasing on it even, maybe 4X, you're having a fantastic gaming experience.
[1831.80 → 1836.92] Someone says 1440p is possible with HDMI. Yeah, if you want to run at 30 frames per second, good for
[1836.92 → 1847.24] you. Okay, so whatever. Gaming experience is great at 2560 by 1600. So I don't necessarily see the value
[1847.24 → 1852.52] from a pure gaming perspective, but to me, it's about text and about screen real estate, being able to
[1852.52 → 1858.36] have things be crystal clear and be small and be able to manage them and move them around. I also
[1858.36 → 1865.32] see the value on a projector, where you're going to have an extremely large display, and the extra
[1865.32 → 1871.08] detail is going to be very, very helpful. Whereas for something like a 55-inch TV, why?
[1872.84 → 1878.28] I actually... No, absolutely. I can't. I have a projector in my bedroom on a 92-inch screen,
[1878.28 → 1883.80] and when I stand within three feet of it at 1080p, I can clearly see each and every pixel. I mean,
[1883.80 → 1888.44] I can point them out with a stick. So it just makes sense to have that super high resolution. But I can
[1888.44 → 1892.36] tell you, even at that experience with a 92-inch screen, when I'm standing 12 feet away, I can't
[1892.36 → 1896.92] make out individual pixels. And I got 20-15 vision. So it's not like I'm blind, but... Right.
[1896.92 → 1900.68] You know, so it's like when this, when 8K comes out, it's like, yeah, that'll be awesome if I,
[1900.68 → 1904.92] you know, can build that fancy palatial mansion I've wanted with a 300-inch screen. Then yeah,
[1904.92 → 1910.04] bring it on. But 4K, definitely. If I had a 4K 46-inch screen sitting in front of me instead of
[1910.04 → 1913.56] a 1080p panel, it would be huge, especially for software development, because then I could
[1913.56 → 1917.24] essentially split my screen into four quadrants and still have that same resolution and still
[1917.24 → 1922.36] see that text. Yeah, that's going to be frigging awesome. I'm super excited for that.
[1924.28 → 1929.96] Okay, sorry. Guys, I've got this now. This is the amazing USB cable.
[1929.96 → 1930.52] Sound muted.
[1930.52 → 1932.76] That can, yeah, I know this sounds muted. Oh, I got to see this.
[1932.76 → 1938.92] Yeah, this is like a miracle USB cable. So there's like a band or something. It's the
[1938.92 → 1942.52] Light speed USB cable. So this is... Ooh, Light speed.
[1942.52 → 1947.96] Yeah. So, okay. I mean, this, this text underneath here is kind of awesome. Larry Ho, founder and
[1947.96 → 1952.52] president of Light Harmonic is a self-described tube lover and vinyl file, which may seem odd since
[1952.52 → 1956.44] he's the founder of our all digital company. You may be surprised, therefore, to find out that
[1956.44 → 1960.44] before he founded Light Harmonic, he worked as the executive vice president of a leading USB
[1960.44 → 1963.48] integrated circuit company. Don't bother telling us who it is. I guess it doesn't matter.
[1963.48 → 1968.04] Oh, actually, wait, that would be really important. He and his team of over 150 electronic engineers.
[1968.76 → 1973.88] Something, something, something. USB 2 audio class standard developed, the DSP, etc, etc, etc.
[1973.88 → 1978.52] Why is this even here? Okay, so he's holding the cable now. So this is a very special USB cable.
[1978.52 → 1983.80] Okay, it has like a it's coiled up, it's, he's holding it. Okay, no, I want to show you the really special one.
[1983.80 → 1992.84] So this USB cable, check this out. Okay, so they separate data. Okay, see this? They actually separate data and power,
[1992.84 → 2000.68] because, you know, the interference and all that. And this gives the Light speed USB cable 20 times the bandwidth of USB 2.0.
[2000.68 → 2007.32] Oh my god. 10 gigabits per second bandwidth is twice as fast as USB 3.0. Additionally, it's two-in-one architecture,
[2007.32 → 2010.68] physically separates the signal leg from the five-volt power leg, preventing source-generated
[2010.68 → 2015.24] noise from disturbing the digital signal. The result? A bit-perfect USB cable.
[2016.52 → 2020.20] So the obvious question I have is why couldn't they just improve upon the shielding? I mean,
[2020.20 → 2023.40] why can't I just have a cable that's like an inch and a half thick that's just filled with shielding?
[2023.40 → 2025.64] Why do I have to have it spaced out that far? That's our ground.
[2025.64 → 2027.40] Why do they need more shielding?
[2030.28 → 2033.96] I don't know. We're dealing with very low voltage. I mean, I honestly don't know how it could make
[2033.96 → 2036.04] any difference, but... Rated bandwidth.
[2038.04 → 2041.88] Like, how do you measure 10 gigabits per second rated bandwidth on a USB 2 cable?
[2043.00 → 2049.64] And like, I love how they're comparing. They're comparing the rated bandwidth with the USB 2 standard,
[2049.64 → 2054.52] not with whatever test they're using to measure their bandwidth on their cable,
[2054.52 → 2058.36] putting a USB 2 cable in it and seeing what that's capable of. Because I suspect
[2058.36 → 2063.64] that it's going to have no impact whatsoever, because that's not actually how this thing works.
[2063.64 → 2068.36] I think he's selling snake oil here, guys. I mean, seriously, look, the wires are basically
[2068.36 → 2071.88] touching each other, going all the way into the connector, and they're separated three inches out.
[2071.88 → 2073.16] I mean, it's like...
[2073.16 → 2074.12] That's a good point.
[2074.12 → 2075.32] I'm thinking this is more...
[2075.32 → 2078.20] You know, the audiophiles, I know I'm going to offend the hell out of audiophiles right now,
[2078.20 → 2082.68] but you know how the audiophiles are like, oh my god, if you spend a thousand dollars on an optical cable,
[2082.68 → 2085.64] it'll have no digital jitter, and you won't be able to hear the photons, you know,
[2085.64 → 2089.56] with that 126,000 mile per second or whatever boundary, blah, blah, blah.
[2089.56 → 2091.96] No, I think this is that same thing. Yeah, your cable looks awesome.
[2091.96 → 2094.20] People are going to look at it and go, oh my god, what does that do for you?
[2095.48 → 2096.12] That's about it.
[2096.84 → 2099.00] Okay, this is one of the...
[2099.56 → 2101.80] This is one of Easel's favourite things.
[2102.36 → 2103.88] Okay, so get this. We're gonna...
[2103.88 → 2104.84] We're gonna...
[2104.84 → 2107.88] I feel bad because audiophiles are nice people, but...
[2107.88 → 2109.16] Sometimes.
[2109.16 → 2110.12] This review...
[2110.12 → 2112.04] Oh, I am too. I've got 10 pairs of headphones.
[2112.04 → 2114.36] I mean, ranging like way up over a thousand dollars,
[2114.36 → 2116.20] and I honestly sometimes can't tell the difference.
[2116.20 → 2120.12] I mean, to be clear guys, audiophile means you love audio.
[2120.12 → 2123.24] It doesn't mean that you have to be a, you know, jerk about it.
[2123.24 → 2124.92] Okay, so this is a review of...
[2124.92 → 2125.88] Preach on, Linus.
[2125.88 → 2128.20] And you speaker cables, okay?
[2128.20 → 2130.20] So these are super fancy cables.
[2130.20 → 2134.36] I think they're like hundreds or thousands of dollars, something ridiculous like that.
[2134.36 → 2136.28] And this is a quote from the review.
[2136.28 → 2141.08] In extended listening sessions, I found the cable's greatest strength to be its PRT.
[2141.32 → 2143.88] Simply put, these are very danceable cables.
[2144.20 → 2148.68] Music playing through them results in the proverbial foot-tapping scene with the need or
[2148.68 → 2150.36] desire to get up and move.
[2150.36 → 2151.88] Great swing and pace.
[2151.88 → 2154.44] These cables smack that right on the nose big time.
[2154.44 → 2160.36] In this area, they are simply way better than anything else I have heard prior to their edition.
[2161.08 → 2162.36] Danceable cables, really?
[2162.36 → 2164.84] Dude, I want to buy them after reading that.
[2164.84 → 2166.84] I mean, I'll be reviewing those next week, guys.
[2169.56 → 2171.56] I've got someone asking what Items I'm wearing.
[2171.56 → 2173.40] These are Sennheiser IE80s.
[2173.40 → 2175.64] I'm actually going to have a review coming of them shortly.
[2175.64 → 2179.00] I'm super excited to do the review because I super, super like them.
[2179.00 → 2181.72] So I always get more excited about doing reviews.
[2181.72 → 2182.92] They make you look like you need a guitar.
[2183.96 → 2185.24] I love these custom one pro.
[2185.24 → 2187.16] I just think the cable isn't danceable enough.
[2187.16 → 2188.36] Danceable enough, I know.
[2188.36 → 2189.08] Well, you know what?
[2189.08 → 2193.72] These cables, they were danceable, and then they got like tangled in my feet and I fell.
[2193.72 → 2196.20] And the danceability of them went down a lot.
[2197.16 → 2199.32] Well guys, just remember copper is no good anymore.
[2199.32 → 2202.36] It has to be pure silver cable because that makes the treble sound better.
[2202.36 → 2204.44] You know what's the hilarious thing about that?
[2204.44 → 2208.52] Is that USB 2 10 gigabits per second cable is copper.
[2208.52 → 2213.56] It's not even, they didn't even bother to put any money into manufacturing it.
[2213.56 → 2213.72] Yeah.
[2214.76 → 2216.76] Not, not even interested unless its pure silver.
[2217.48 → 2218.36] Copper just doesn't work.
[2220.28 → 2220.76] All right.
[2220.76 → 2225.16] So you might have a you might have a little bit of contribution to make to this.
[2225.16 → 2226.52] This is kind of an interesting topic.
[2226.52 → 2228.04] Let's go ahead and screen share here.
[2228.60 → 2233.32] Flying hacker contraption hunts other drones, turns them into zombies.
[2234.20 → 2237.16] Slick, do you want to, do you want to sort of kick us off on this one?
[2237.16 → 2238.36] I thought this was fantastic.
[2238.36 → 2243.24] And there's, there are different ways of looking at this because it would have happened no matter what.
[2243.80 → 2246.44] So the guy that did it released all of his stuff.
[2246.44 → 2249.16] So everyone knows how it happened and can start building protection.
[2249.16 → 2251.24] So that's one way to do it in a good way.
[2253.48 → 2259.40] So like, so how it works is you fly your drone, which has, I believe, a Raspberry Pi strapped to it,
[2259.40 → 2266.76] and a USB battery pack and a little like Wi-Fi antenna so you can grab Wi-Fi networks easily.
[2266.76 → 2272.04] And you fly it near another drone and then attack it, disconnect the other user,
[2272.04 → 2276.76] connect yourself and then steal the drone, which is kind of incredible.
[2276.76 → 2283.48] And with all the stuff going around about like the new, the new shipping drones in China and Amazon's drones and
[2284.36 → 2289.16] just people generally being more and more interested in drones that it's, it's actually pretty interesting.
[2289.64 → 2294.92] Um, because there's like pretty much no security on them right now because who would have really
[2294.92 → 2296.52] thought that would be a huge issue.
[2296.52 → 2301.24] But then now, like I just said with Amazon, Ada, Ada, it is becoming a huge issue, and it's,
[2301.24 → 2304.44] it's, it's kind of incredible how well this thing works.
[2305.24 → 2306.20] So yeah, he does that.
[2306.20 → 2307.24] He does a demo of it.
[2307.24 → 2312.20] So I'm going to go ahead, and I'm going to pull up the, uh, the Ars Technica article again here.
[2312.20 → 2314.04] Let me see if they have the video embedded in it.
[2314.04 → 2315.00] Yep, they do.
[2315.00 → 2319.40] So I'm just going to skip ahead a little bit here, but we're going to walk you through sort of the
[2319.40 → 2319.80] process.
[2319.80 → 2321.48] So there might be sound.
[2321.48 → 2322.68] Yeah, no, there's no sound.
[2322.68 → 2326.52] So here he is talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.
[2326.52 → 2327.32] Oh, is the demo?
[2327.32 → 2328.28] I thought the demo was at the end.
[2328.28 → 2329.96] No, it's, it's going to be right in here.
[2329.96 → 2330.36] Yeah, here he is.
[2330.36 → 2330.52] Okay.
[2330.52 → 2332.36] So he grabs, he grabs the drone.
[2333.40 → 2333.80] Okay.
[2333.80 → 2334.92] Something, something, something.
[2334.92 → 2336.12] I think he shows what he puts on it.
[2336.12 → 2337.40] Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2338.28 → 2338.68] All right.
[2338.68 → 2340.60] So he's talking about, I think it's a Raspberry Pi.
[2340.60 → 2341.24] There we go.
[2341.24 → 2341.72] There we go.
[2341.72 → 2342.44] Go back a little bit.
[2342.92 → 2343.80] Go back a little bit.
[2343.80 → 2344.84] There we go.
[2344.84 → 2345.00] Okay.
[2345.00 → 2345.96] So he has another drone in the room.
[2345.96 → 2348.28] So to be clear, guys, this is a Parrot AR drone.
[2348.28 → 2351.88] This is just a consumer grade fun device.
[2351.88 → 2356.60] So I don't think we're expecting any kind of commercially, a drone that gets approved for
[2356.60 → 2359.80] commercial use to not have any protection on it whatsoever.
[2359.80 → 2366.52] But basically what he does is he's, he's running, uh, he's running this right here, and he is taking
[2366.52 → 2367.88] over the other drone.
[2367.88 → 2372.60] So what he first does is he, he finds it, disconnects the original user, connects himself,
[2372.60 → 2373.32] and then takes over.
[2373.32 → 2378.84] And then he's got it set up so that the drone will just follow his drone because it has a camera.
[2378.84 → 2379.64] So it knows where to go.
[2379.64 → 2381.96] So, so what do you think about it, Barn, please?
[2381.96 → 2383.24] Oh my God.
[2383.24 → 2384.36] Don't even get me started.
[2384.36 → 2385.72] Actually go ahead and get me started.
[2385.72 → 2388.68] I actually have a Parrot AR drone and I absolutely love it.
[2388.68 → 2389.16] It's really cool.
[2389.16 → 2393.56] But the way it works in a nutshell is it has, it just connects up to your Wi-Fi network and all
[2393.56 → 2395.80] of the data and commands are just transported over that network.
[2395.80 → 2396.12] Yep.
[2396.12 → 2401.32] So all he's doing with that Raspberry Pi is just basically disconnecting it from one wireless
[2401.32 → 2403.80] network, connecting it to his, and then going, Hey, I'm the controller.
[2403.80 → 2404.28] Follow me.
[2404.28 → 2404.84] Yep.
[2404.84 → 2408.36] And, uh, it's funny because it reminds me of the ancient RC technology.
[2408.36 → 2411.00] Like I used to be really into RC airplanes and helicopters.
[2411.00 → 2414.60] And I remember the number one carnal rule was you always had to check in your crystal,
[2414.60 → 2417.88] which was the frequency you're operating on at the field before you started.
[2417.88 → 2421.48] Because if you made the complete boner of pulling out your controller and putting the
[2421.48 → 2424.84] wrong crystal in it, all of a sudden you're flying some other dude's plane.
[2424.84 → 2428.12] And so this is kind of like the more high-tech version of that.
[2428.12 → 2430.84] And I could see them just, you know, defeating this with a little bit of encryption.
[2430.84 → 2431.32] Yeah.
[2431.32 → 2434.92] Um, but it still just cracks me up that, you know, it took this long for somebody just
[2434.92 → 2436.76] to figure out, wait a second, all these devices.
[2436.76 → 2438.20] And it's not just those drones.
[2438.20 → 2439.00] Think about it.
[2439.00 → 2441.32] Things like the Belching Demo switches and stuff like that.
[2441.32 → 2445.40] A lot of stuff operates on wireless networks and every single one of them has to be able to
[2445.40 → 2447.48] issue a command to disconnect and connect to another network.
[2447.48 → 2449.96] So I'm going to see this, this, this now is happening with drones.
[2449.96 → 2451.24] You wait, this is going to be happening with
[2451.24 → 2454.04] every single 802.11 connected device at some point.
[2455.00 → 2455.32] Yep.
[2455.32 → 2456.12] And like, oh yeah.
[2456.12 → 2458.44] And it's probably easier just to shoot them down with BB guns.
[2458.44 → 2458.92] That too.
[2458.92 → 2459.40] Yeah.
[2459.40 → 2459.80] Yeah.
[2459.80 → 2460.28] Yeah.
[2460.28 → 2463.88] I, that I'm actually kind of scared about, but I think we'll talk about that later, um,
[2463.88 → 2465.16] because of bullet drop and stuff.
[2465.16 → 2471.64] But anyway, um, yeah, my, my thing about this was, I think it didn't happen until now
[2471.64 → 2475.72] because there, there, there wasn't a ton, like you couldn't just go fly around the city
[2475.72 → 2478.20] and find someone else with an AR drone very easily.
[2478.20 → 2482.52] I think it happens now more because of all the announcements of like that, that company
[2482.52 → 2486.52] in China that wants to do shipment drones and Amazon that wants to do shipment drones and
[2486.52 → 2489.40] all the different shipping companies that want to do shipment drones and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2490.68 → 2491.00] Yeah.
[2491.00 → 2494.44] The other thing that kind of raises a concern too, is you, you just assume that like military
[2494.44 → 2496.84] and commercial, like you said, the commercial aircraft will have a lot more protection.
[2496.84 → 2501.32] Well, that might be the truth now, but before this was considered a threat, who knows how many,
[2501.32 → 2504.36] you know, other stuff that's in operation out there right now simply just doesn't have any
[2504.36 → 2505.00] encryption or anything.
[2505.00 → 2506.84] Cause there was, there's really not a president for it.
[2506.84 → 2510.68] And like this guy released all of this stuff online and everyone can see it working all
[2510.68 → 2511.16] that kind of stuff.
[2511.16 → 2515.00] But how many people developed this before him and kept it secret?
[2515.00 → 2515.40] Yeah.
[2515.40 → 2515.56] Yeah.
[2515.56 → 2517.40] And the other thing is look how cheap it is to do.
[2517.40 → 2519.80] I mean, I think including the drone, it's 400 bucks.
[2519.80 → 2523.96] It's less than $200 for the hardware to outfit your drone to do this.
[2523.96 → 2525.96] And the other thing is thought about the other applications.
[2525.96 → 2529.80] Don't just go take over other drones, go take over and jam other people's networks.
[2529.80 → 2533.16] You know, next time you guys get DDoS, it might be by somebody's pair AR drone hanging
[2533.16 → 2534.04] outside your building.
[2534.04 → 2534.84] I mean, you don't know.
[2534.84 → 2535.40] Yeah.
[2535.40 → 2536.60] That's true.
[2536.60 → 2537.96] Thanks for giving people that idea.
[2537.96 → 2539.40] Absolutely.
[2539.40 → 2539.96] Anytime.
[2539.96 → 2540.52] Brilliant.
[2540.52 → 2544.52] All right.
[2544.52 → 2546.52] So this is an article.
[2546.52 → 2549.40] I mean, you're a fellow YouTuber, so I'm sure that
[2549.40 → 2554.60] you think that YouTube's implementation of Google Plus comments versus the old YouTube
[2554.60 → 2560.52] comments was seamless and excellent and great for the community and for creators in every
[2560.52 → 2561.24] possible way.
[2561.24 → 2562.20] Does that sound about right?
[2562.92 → 2567.80] If by that you mean I want to stab them and burn them and laugh and giggle over their
[2567.80 → 2568.84] corpses, yes.
[2568.84 → 2569.24] Yes.
[2569.24 → 2570.28] That's exactly what that means.
[2570.28 → 2572.68] So this is an article from PCMag.com.
[2572.68 → 2577.88] YouTube admits Google Plus comment integration boosted spam.
[2577.88 → 2585.48] I mean, that's like a farmer admitting that he probably shovelled horse poo at some point.
[2585.48 → 2591.96] Like, it's the most obvious thing in the world, but at least they're acknowledging it.
[2592.52 → 2596.84] What's your take on what they did and then what they've done to improve it so far?
[2596.84 → 2598.28] All right.
[2598.28 → 2602.44] Well, in the beginning, the thing that really perplexed me was how am I getting so much spam
[2602.44 → 2605.56] in my stream, but comments like, Hey, Barnacles, you're awesome or Barnacles.
[2605.56 → 2606.76] Hey, awesome job and stuff.
[2606.76 → 2608.12] Why are those the spam comments?
[2608.12 → 2610.36] It seemed like their whole spam system was broken to begin with.
[2610.36 → 2610.76] Yeah.
[2610.76 → 2613.08] And then after that, we started seeing Bob.
[2613.08 → 2614.20] Everybody knows Bob now.
[2614.20 → 2617.56] I'm sure on first name basis, but you know, then he starts spamming across the internet.
[2617.56 → 2619.72] Of course they can't put that to stop.
[2619.72 → 2622.92] But the one thing I did notice, like if there was one good thing to come out of it, and I'm actually
[2622.92 → 2625.88] like playing devil's advocate to myself here because I actually like trolls personally.
[2625.88 → 2627.40] Trolls actually entertain me.
[2627.40 → 2631.40] Um, they're a large part of my YouTube channel and coming up, and I have a fun beating them down.
[2631.40 → 2633.56] But at the same time, where did all the trolls go?
[2633.56 → 2636.12] Google plus came into play, and now I can't find my trolls there.
[2636.12 → 2639.72] Everybody's kind of being like nice, and I don't know.
[2639.72 → 2642.28] It makes it so hard to sleep at night.
[2642.28 → 2646.92] Honestly, the thing that's driven me craziest is whenever you go to a video and then all the
[2646.92 → 2651.24] top comments are just like some dude and his buddies talking on Google plus about like,
[2651.24 → 2656.20] whatever, because he posted a video and then they all talk about their personal lives.
[2656.20 → 2657.64] And it's like, I don't want to, what?
[2657.64 → 2658.52] I don't want to read this.
[2658.52 → 2664.52] And the thing that bothers me most, I think, is the fact that Google prioritizes so high
[2664.52 → 2671.16] above everyone else, the people who are commenting on the Google plus posting of the video.
[2671.16 → 2676.28] So my initial post and then the comments that are under that, because of people happen to use
[2676.28 → 2681.32] Google plus and happen to follow me there, those are getting a much higher priority than
[2681.32 → 2685.16] anything else, even if they're totally irrelevant and have nothing to do with anything.
[2685.16 → 2690.04] Because this is Google's way of just cramming Google plus down our throats.
[2690.04 → 2691.48] I don't like Google plus.
[2691.48 → 2693.00] I don't find it easy to use.
[2693.00 → 2696.60] I can't think of a compelling reason why I would ask anyone else to use it.
[2696.60 → 2701.40] Um, I actually, this is something that I'll, I'll be mentioning in my Nexus 5 review.
[2701.40 → 2706.36] But again, cramming Google plus down my throat, where are my Twitter notifications, Google?
[2707.64 → 2710.12] Well, my Twitter notification settings just don't work.
[2710.12 → 2710.52] Really?
[2710.52 → 2710.92] Yeah.
[2710.92 → 2714.12] Whereas Google plus comes through every time.
[2716.04 → 2718.76] No, it's the Google plus was a failure on their part.
[2718.76 → 2720.68] Their launch to try to compete with Facebook and everything.
[2720.68 → 2721.96] It was a total and utter failure.
[2721.96 → 2725.40] So what better way to force it down your throat and turn it into success than to take the one
[2725.40 → 2727.56] thing you can't live without and force it on you.
[2727.56 → 2729.00] I mean, that's exactly what they did.
[2729.00 → 2733.16] I think the thing that's most baffling to me is the fact that the, the implementation
[2733.16 → 2734.68] was so stupid.
[2734.92 → 2741.00] I mean, the fact that they would allow people to copy and paste entire novels into, I mean, YouTube
[2741.00 → 2742.84] had this figured out years ago.
[2742.84 → 2744.92] That's why we had a 500-character limit.
[2746.28 → 2748.52] And why were features coming on like daily?
[2748.52 → 2751.24] That was the other thing I didn't get is like, I don't know what their development cycle
[2751.24 → 2754.68] is like that over there, but being a software developer myself, usually have things like
[2754.68 → 2757.72] sprints and stuff where it's like you figure stuff out for a little bit before you go and
[2757.72 → 2759.08] cram it down people's throats.
[2759.08 → 2763.08] I was literally logging into YouTube every day and seeing a new feature.
[2763.08 → 2767.80] Like they didn't even let like feature a boil for 24 hours for feature B and feature C.
[2767.80 → 2770.52] And sometimes it was changes to the same feature within 24 hours.
[2770.52 → 2770.76] Yeah.
[2770.76 → 2771.88] I was like, that's not cool.
[2771.88 → 2775.72] I mean, they're basically turned their entire YouTube, like the largest media outlet on the
[2775.72 → 2777.48] planet into a beta testing pit.
[2777.48 → 2778.36] Yep.
[2778.36 → 2779.96] But they've always kind of been like that.
[2779.96 → 2781.80] It's just, it seems more rampant.
[2781.80 → 2783.88] They've never really operated at that scale.
[2783.88 → 2787.56] I didn't think, I mean, YouTube's kind of, I don't know, that's, that's a whole different world in a whole
[2787.56 → 2788.20] different scale.
[2788.20 → 2790.84] Ah, but they've always done this on YouTube.
[2790.84 → 2791.96] It's like, here's a new layout.
[2791.96 → 2793.08] Boom.
[2793.08 → 2793.40] Yep.
[2793.40 → 2795.32] Might not like work for people.
[2795.32 → 2795.40] Yeah.
[2795.40 → 2797.24] Everybody that works so hard to make their channels look cool.
[2797.24 → 2797.88] Take it away.
[2797.88 → 2798.36] Yeah.
[2798.36 → 2798.68] Yeah.
[2798.68 → 2800.28] That, that's still frustrating to me.
[2800.28 → 2803.96] We have like really cool channel designs, particularly for tech quickie that just,
[2803.96 → 2805.08] we don't get to use anymore.
[2805.08 → 2807.48] My, my wife was looking at our channel the other day.
[2807.48 → 2809.24] She was like, this doesn't look very good.
[2809.88 → 2813.40] And then she was looking at someone else's, and she was like, this one looks a lot better.
[2813.40 → 2814.44] The layout's a lot better.
[2814.44 → 2816.52] And I'm like, oh, are you subscribed to that one?
[2816.52 → 2817.56] And she's like, no.
[2817.56 → 2821.96] And I'm like, yeah, when you're subscribed, instead of actually seeing the video that I
[2821.96 → 2826.60] put on my channel and it being big, it's like a little tiny video, what to watch next.
[2826.60 → 2828.36] And then it's like crap that you already watched.
[2828.36 → 2829.96] It's like, thanks for that.
[2829.96 → 2830.68] I guess.
[2831.40 → 2833.00] Well, it's like, I mean, I feel you.
[2833.00 → 2836.84] Because I, I worked a year to get a feature turned on and then everybody just gets it.
[2836.84 → 2839.08] And then I, you know, get another feature turned on.
[2839.08 → 2839.96] Everybody gets it now.
[2839.96 → 2841.72] It's like, it just, I don't know.
[2841.72 → 2844.12] It kind of invalidates your work a little bit.
[2844.12 → 2844.36] Yeah.
[2845.00 → 2848.36] Try not, try not to sound too snobbish there, but it's like, yeah, you work so hard to get
[2848.36 → 2849.08] those things unlocked.
[2849.08 → 2851.24] And it's like, you know, it's like you being on Xbox Live.
[2851.24 → 2852.84] It's like you unlock every achievement.
[2852.84 → 2855.24] And then the next day they come out, and they're like, okay, we're just going to unlock all the
[2855.24 → 2856.44] achievements by default for everybody.
[2856.44 → 2856.76] Have fun.
[2856.76 → 2856.84] Yeah.
[2856.84 → 2861.96] It's like, okay, you might've unlocked the dog achievement in like Call of Duty 2, but now
[2861.96 → 2863.88] the new game is just going to have dogs for all.
[2865.32 → 2865.72] Exactly.
[2865.72 → 2867.80] It's still the number one selling game in the UK.
[2868.36 → 2868.68] Is it?
[2868.68 → 2869.16] Yeah.
[2869.16 → 2872.76] One of the articles I was looking at, it's like, it's at the top of the charts, Call of
[2872.76 → 2875.24] Duty ghosts or whatever this stupid thing is called.
[2875.24 → 2876.20] Um, okay.
[2876.20 → 2881.88] So speaking, speaking of the terrible spam filtration, let's go over to my screen for a minute here,
[2882.36 → 2887.56] where I'm, I just pulled up one of my videos, and I've actually had some people complaining
[2887.56 → 2893.08] to me that I was, um, that I was deleting their comments, um, when they were legitimate
[2893.08 → 2896.76] comments, questioning something about what I was doing, or they were just other random
[2896.76 → 2897.08] comments.
[2897.08 → 2898.36] Linus, why am I blocked from your channel?
[2898.36 → 2899.24] Why are you deleting my comments?
[2899.24 → 2899.40] Okay.
[2899.40 → 2900.44] So check this out.
[2900.44 → 2904.52] Automatic spam delete detection, which I actually can't control.
[2905.56 → 2906.12] Okay.
[2906.12 → 2908.68] So here's one that's a link to a store.
[2908.68 → 2910.12] So that might be spam.
[2910.12 → 2912.68] Here's someone complaining about how much it costs.
[2912.68 → 2914.04] That's not spam.
[2914.04 → 2915.08] Here's someone saying too bad.
[2915.08 → 2916.28] Germany has had this a long time.
[2916.28 → 2917.56] The U S has always last to get it.
[2917.56 → 2919.00] How is that spam?
[2919.00 → 2921.48] There was a modern selling the same thing years ago.
[2921.48 → 2922.68] How is that spam?
[2922.68 → 2925.48] These are all useful contributions to the conversation.
[2925.48 → 2925.96] Yep.
[2925.96 → 2927.32] There's people with replies.
[2927.32 → 2928.12] Look at this.
[2928.12 → 2929.56] Isn't this ridiculous?
[2929.56 → 2930.68] None of this is spam.
[2931.40 → 2932.84] You should know it's so broken.
[2932.84 → 2934.84] I actually, it's horrible, man.
[2934.84 → 2936.60] I got, I got a comment the other day that just said,
[2936.60 → 2937.16] Barnacles.
[2937.16 → 2938.36] I hope you're feeling better.
[2938.36 → 2939.56] How the hell is that spam?
[2940.84 → 2941.32] That's right.
[2941.32 → 2942.52] And then I hit okay to approve it.
[2942.52 → 2944.36] And then I don't have a reply button that,
[2944.36 → 2945.64] I mean, you need to be able to reply.
[2945.64 → 2947.80] Why can you only reply to some people, not others?
[2947.80 → 2948.44] I don't get that.
[2948.44 → 2949.56] That drives me crazy.
[2949.56 → 2950.04] Look at this.
[2950.04 → 2953.08] I think that's if people post on Google Plus,
[2953.08 → 2953.88] you can reply to them.
[2953.88 → 2954.28] Yep.
[2954.28 → 2954.76] Yep.
[2954.76 → 2957.16] It's driving me crazy because people will ask me questions,
[2957.16 → 2958.92] not realizing I can't answer them.
[2958.92 → 2959.40] Yeah.
[2959.40 → 2959.80] Exactly.
[2959.80 → 2960.60] That's my problem too.
[2960.60 → 2960.92] They're like,
[2960.92 → 2962.76] Oh, hey, what graphics card would you recommend buying?
[2962.76 → 2963.08] And I'm like,
[2963.08 → 2964.36] Well, if I could find that reply button,
[2964.36 → 2965.72] maybe I'd give you a suggestion.
[2965.72 → 2966.44] Probably not though.
[2966.44 → 2967.08] Yeah.
[2967.08 → 2968.76] So, yeah.
[2968.76 → 2969.32] So there's,
[2969.32 → 2975.00] so 41 comments marked as spam out of which probably two of them might be spam.
[2975.00 → 2977.24] Negative 14 comments marked as spam.
[2977.24 → 2977.48] Yeah.
[2977.48 → 2977.96] Brilliant.
[2977.96 → 2978.36] Awesome.
[2978.36 → 2981.40] I hope they're not using the same spam filters they are on the Google search engine.
[2981.40 → 2983.16] Because if so, you're missing out on a lot of stuff.
[2983.16 → 2983.88] Yeah.
[2983.88 → 2984.28] Yeah.
[2984.28 → 2988.04] So, I mean, that's really frustrating to me because I can't even turn that off.
[2988.04 → 2991.48] I don't have a setting to just turn it off because I don't want it.
[2991.48 → 2993.08] You do have a setting where you can add them.
[2993.08 → 2993.48] Did you see?
[2993.48 → 2993.88] Yeah.
[2993.88 → 2994.28] I saw that.
[2994.28 → 2994.76] Did you see the setting on your social?
[2994.76 → 2995.24] Yeah.
[2995.24 → 2997.16] I added a bunch of stuff under there, and it didn't work.
[2997.16 → 2998.44] Like half the stuff still got through.
[2998.44 → 2999.56] I was like, okay, I just give up.
[3001.40 → 3004.04] Block all the helpful contributions to the conversation.
[3004.92 → 3006.76] Like don't block any of the stuff that's-
[3006.76 → 3007.64] Don't block Bob.
[3007.64 → 3007.80] Yeah.
[3007.80 → 3010.04] Don't block Bob because whatever.
[3010.04 → 3010.84] Because his tank.
[3010.84 → 3011.88] Yeah.
[3011.88 → 3012.68] Because his tank.
[3012.68 → 3013.72] I love how they release this thing.
[3013.72 → 3017.32] They're like, oh yeah, we're adding a better algorithm to stop ASCII art.
[3017.32 → 3018.92] And they're like, go check out some YouTube video.
[3018.92 → 3020.44] It's like, upvote Bob and his tank.
[3020.44 → 3021.24] I'm like, what?
[3021.24 → 3023.48] How hard is it to filter ASCII art?
[3023.48 → 3024.12] Oh my god.
[3024.12 → 3026.92] Just don't grab any character over 128, and we're golden.
[3026.92 → 3029.08] Like really, it's not that hard folks.
[3029.08 → 3034.12] And the other thing too is the way that their spam filter works is by word.
[3034.12 → 3039.96] I was like, okay, well, can I enter the tank into the spam?
[3039.96 → 3041.32] Nope.
[3041.32 → 3043.16] Can I enter Bob's army?
[3043.88 → 3044.20] Nope.
[3044.20 → 3046.20] No, what you can do, I did stop Bob.
[3046.20 → 3046.44] You can stop Bob.
[3046.44 → 3047.88] And I'm not going to filter Bob.
[3047.88 → 3049.24] Why would I filter the word Bob?
[3049.24 → 3052.20] Someone might be legitimately talking about someone named Bob.
[3052.20 → 3053.24] So I don't want to do that.
[3053.24 → 3054.84] I know he might be your uncle.
[3054.84 → 3055.56] You never know.
[3055.56 → 3056.20] Oh!
[3056.20 → 3057.24] Lol.
[3057.24 → 3059.56] That was like your-
[3059.56 → 3061.56] That was terrible.
[3061.56 → 3062.20] I love it.
[3062.20 → 3063.40] I love it.
[3063.40 → 3064.12] All right.
[3064.12 → 3067.00] Well, let's do a Twitter blitz for Barnacles here.
[3067.00 → 3072.20] Guys, if you have any questions for Barnacles, hit up the at Linus Tech Twitter handle, that
[3072.20 → 3073.08] one right there.
[3073.08 → 3075.40] And we're going to have him blitz through them for you.
[3075.40 → 3080.92] So I should probably go ahead and put this here and put that there and go ahead and do
[3080.92 → 3081.40] the Twitter.
[3081.40 → 3084.52] In the meantime, let's take some of the random questions we've gotten on Twitter over the
[3084.52 → 3085.08] last little bit.
[3085.08 → 3085.96] All right.
[3085.96 → 3087.96] Have you done any videos on Crossfire versus us?
[3087.96 → 3089.80] Not really, actually.
[3090.60 → 3094.04] On the Nexus 5, Twitter notifications work fine, but I don't get thousands every day.
[3094.04 → 3094.28] Yeah.
[3094.28 → 3096.52] The problem is that a lot of them don't come through.
[3097.00 → 3097.72] Some of them do.
[3097.72 → 3103.64] So people that I follow, I see my mentions from them, but I'm not getting my mentions
[3103.64 → 3105.16] from anyone that I don't follow.
[3105.16 → 3106.68] So that's pretty interesting to me.
[3107.48 → 3109.48] I'm looking to get my first mechanical keyboard.
[3109.48 → 3111.96] I'm about to spend very max 200.
[3111.96 → 3116.84] I would recommend waiting maybe a little bit or no, because I heard the RGB ones aren't coming
[3116.84 → 3117.80] for a while.
[3117.80 → 3120.04] Your first mechanical keyboard, seriously?
[3120.04 → 3121.88] And like very max 200.
[3121.88 → 3123.00] The Great Linus?
[3123.00 → 3123.72] Oh my God.
[3124.36 → 3125.64] No, not my first one.
[3125.64 → 3126.92] Who is this?
[3126.92 → 3128.20] He's talking about someone on Twitter.
[3128.20 → 3128.84] Someone on Twitter.
[3128.84 → 3132.92] Um, and 200 bucks max for a mechanical keyboard includes like everything.
[3132.92 → 3135.48] Uh, Jonathan, we'll be talking about drones a little bit more later.
[3136.52 → 3140.44] Well, as far as keyboards, I, I have four mechanical keyboards, and they're all DOS keyboards,
[3140.44 → 3143.72] but real, really, I've used quite a few different keyboards with mechanical switches and
[3143.72 → 3144.76] they're all, they're all pretty good.
[3144.76 → 3146.20] I haven't found any, I would say are bad.
[3146.84 → 3149.88] What is Logan talking about?
[3149.88 → 3151.80] Apparently you're getting an Indian burn.
[3151.80 → 3152.84] Oh, oh yeah.
[3152.84 → 3157.16] Because I've been, uh, I've been posting links to his old Tiger direct videos.
[3157.16 → 3159.16] Did you see the, the standup comedy one?
[3160.12 → 3161.56] Oh, it's so good.
[3162.28 → 3163.80] It's amazing here.
[3163.80 → 3165.00] Uh, Tiger.
[3165.64 → 3167.96] I told him I'd stop doing it, but I'm just going to do it.
[3167.96 → 3169.40] Tiger Ben.
[3169.40 → 3171.64] Logan, I'll film the Indian burn.
[3172.04 → 3173.24] If you're watching this, I will.
[3173.24 → 3175.56] I want to see a video of him just full on tackle you.
[3175.56 → 3176.44] I think that'd be awesome.
[3176.44 → 3177.08] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3177.08 → 3178.60] We need, we need audio for that.
[3178.60 → 3180.52] I'd be, I'd be down to film that as well.
[3180.52 → 3181.48] I hate this laptop.
[3181.48 → 3181.80] Okay.
[3181.80 → 3185.32] Please just don't be horrible.
[3185.32 → 3187.56] Uh, I think I needed this.
[3187.56 → 3188.60] Okay, hold on, hold on.
[3189.56 → 3191.56] Oh God, we have no idea how loud this is going to be.
[3191.56 → 3191.80] Here we go.
[3191.80 → 3193.08] I'm going to the Twitch chats.
[3193.08 → 3220.76] I don't think Barnacles could hear that.
[3220.76 → 3221.96] Yeah, I don't think Barnacles could hear.
[3221.96 → 3223.56] Don't worry, Barnacles, everyone else could hear.
[3223.56 → 3225.48] So, so it was all good.
[3225.48 → 3229.96] But anyway, Logan apparently doesn't like me sharing his old Tiger videos.
[3230.76 → 3231.16] All right.
[3231.16 → 3233.00] So we have some Q and A for Barnacles now.
[3233.00 → 3235.08] So Barnacles, this is how Twitter Blitz works.
[3235.08 → 3235.88] I read the question.
[3235.88 → 3237.16] You answer it as quickly as you can.
[3237.72 → 3240.28] Of, of your 10 headphones, which of them is your favourite?
[3242.28 → 3243.64] HD 800 Sennheiser.
[3243.64 → 3244.44] All right.
[3244.44 → 3244.68] Wow.
[3244.68 → 3245.64] You have HD 800s.
[3245.64 → 3246.04] Very nice.
[3246.04 → 3246.44] Sweet.
[3246.44 → 3248.04] I'm looking for, okay.
[3248.04 → 3250.84] That's kind of a long question.
[3250.84 → 3251.24] All right.
[3251.24 → 3253.88] Something, something, something.
[3253.88 → 3255.64] Someone's asking if you're an anonymous.
[3255.64 → 3256.60] That's not.
[3256.60 → 3257.96] So let's not address that.
[3257.96 → 3258.92] No.
[3258.92 → 3259.96] Okay.
[3259.96 → 3261.64] I'm still without mechanical.
[3262.44 → 3263.16] Ah, yes.
[3263.16 → 3267.64] Barnacles, do you still use your three 50-inch TVs as monitors?
[3268.76 → 3271.56] They're actually 46 inch and yes, I use them every single day.
[3271.56 → 3272.76] Very nice.
[3272.76 → 3273.96] Epic.
[3273.96 → 3275.80] Um.
[3275.80 → 3276.92] And I wish they were 50s.
[3277.88 → 3280.84] Cyber Husky asks, are either of us planning to leave YouTube?
[3280.84 → 3281.88] I'm certainly not.
[3281.88 → 3283.56] Uh, Barnacles, are you planning to leave YouTube?
[3284.76 → 3286.20] Only if Google keeps this crap up.
[3286.20 → 3288.36] What are you going to do though?
[3288.36 → 3290.68] Because it's very difficult to take your audience with you.
[3290.68 → 3291.40] Vimeo.
[3291.40 → 3292.36] Yeah, right.
[3293.56 → 3294.20] Well, I don't know.
[3294.20 → 3298.12] I just figure I'll just shut down shop and I don't know, quit my job, move to Mexico.
[3298.12 → 3299.24] No, I'm not leaving YouTube.
[3299.24 → 3299.72] Come on guys.
[3299.72 → 3300.04] Seriously.
[3301.32 → 3301.80] I love it.
[3301.80 → 3302.44] I'm going to Mexico.
[3302.44 → 3304.44] What's your take on smartwatches?
[3306.44 → 3307.32] Smartwatches?
[3307.32 → 3309.32] I ordered a Pebble, and it still hasn't arrived.
[3309.32 → 3310.60] I think I need to contact them.
[3310.60 → 3311.16] Okay.
[3311.16 → 3311.72] It's awesome.
[3311.72 → 3312.92] When it does arrive, it's awesome.
[3313.80 → 3314.28] Okay, cool.
[3314.28 → 3317.16] Um, what are your personal rig specs?
[3318.84 → 3319.48] Oh, sorry.
[3319.48 → 3319.96] I missed that.
[3319.96 → 3321.40] Personal rig specs.
[3322.36 → 3323.48] Oh, my personal rig specs.
[3323.48 → 3326.68] Uh, 3930k overclocked to 4.6 per core.
[3327.00 → 3328.12] 32 gigs RAM.
[3328.12 → 3329.08] Uh, two SSDs.
[3329.08 → 3330.60] I got a new one gig SSD on the way.
[3330.60 → 3335.72] 4WD black 750s and RAID 0, two 360 rads.
[3335.72 → 3336.60] Really heavy pump.
[3336.60 → 3336.92] Can't remember.
[3336.92 → 3337.88] It's an OC cool pump.
[3337.88 → 3341.08] Um, other than that, I mean, I mean, that's pretty much.
[3341.08 → 3341.72] Yeah, other than that.
[3341.72 → 3343.40] You know, like, two 680 for the one edition.
[3343.40 → 3346.52] I guess there's, you know, some dust on the fan or something.
[3347.08 → 3348.68] Oh, I have no cable management.
[3348.68 → 3353.56] The thing looks absolutely, everybody wants to shoot me because I got this really cool computer and I put it together like a five-year-old.
[3353.56 → 3354.76] But come on, it works.
[3354.76 → 3355.08] I'm here.
[3356.28 → 3356.76] Fair enough.
[3356.76 → 3357.88] Yeah.
[3357.88 → 3366.28] Uh, someone wants to ask what's it like working for Microsoft, but I think I know enough about that answer to know that you probably shouldn't talk about it.
[3367.16 → 3369.08] Uh, you should not blame me.
[3369.08 → 3372.20] All I can say is I've been there 15 years, so obviously there must be something good.
[3372.20 → 3373.80] Otherwise, I wouldn't have worked there for 15 years.
[3373.80 → 3378.28] Someone says no question, but just wanted to say you're one of the best guests on the WAN show.
[3378.28 → 3379.24] Thanks for being on the show.
[3379.24 → 3382.68] That's from Iamseveride on Twitter, so that's a cool thing to say.
[3383.24 → 3383.96] I love you, sir.
[3383.96 → 3385.16] I'm going to come and give you a hug.
[3385.16 → 3386.20] That didn't give you a hug.
[3386.20 → 3386.76] As long as you promised not to.
[3387.72 → 3388.04] Yeah.
[3388.04 → 3388.44] What's that?
[3391.08 → 3395.16] Alright, so last question from Austin is what's it like to be a software developer?
[3395.16 → 3400.04] I want to be a software slash computer engineer, but I'd like to know what the workload's like.
[3400.84 → 3402.20] The workload is insane.
[3402.20 → 3407.48] You will never ever hit a milestone no matter how hard you try, and you'll drink a lot of coffee.
[3407.48 → 3412.84] When your wife goes to sleep, you'll go to sleep four hours after she does, and you'll wake up two hours before she does.
[3412.84 → 3414.12] But other than that, it's actually pretty cool.
[3417.24 → 3423.00] It's like, well, you know, I walk to school uphill both ways, and I dig ditches on the way.
[3423.00 → 3423.96] And ADHD is an absolute requirement.
[3423.96 → 3425.00] Yeah, ADHD.
[3426.36 → 3427.96] Yeah, if you don't have ADHD, don't even try.
[3427.96 → 3428.60] Go do something else.
[3429.08 → 3433.00] Thank you very, very much for joining us on the show, Barnacles.
[3433.64 → 3436.20] Why don't you do a quick sort of, hey, this is me.
[3436.20 → 3440.04] This is where you find me if you thought I was interesting once more, and then we'll sign off.
[3441.00 → 3441.56] Oh, awesome.
[3441.56 → 3442.84] Well, guys, thanks for having me on here.
[3442.84 → 3443.64] I really appreciate it.
[3443.64 → 3444.44] This has been a lot of fun.
[3444.44 → 3446.68] This is by far the largest audience I've ever had.
[3447.24 → 3451.88] I've been on other tech shows like Jay's Two Cents and stuff like that, and had a blast, and this has been no different.
[3451.88 → 3453.88] I'm just, I hope someday I get to come back.
[3453.88 → 3458.04] Anyway, guys, I am at httpbarnnerd.com.
[3458.04 → 3459.40] You know where you put your cows in the barn?
[3459.40 → 3460.68] Yeah, I don't know why I keep saying that.
[3460.68 → 3461.80] Anyway, come check me out.
[3461.80 → 3465.08] Follow me on Twitter, at Barnacles, if you thought I was interesting.
[3465.08 → 3470.76] And if you absolutely hate me, and you think I'm the stupidest guest that's ever been on the show, come follow me anyway and tell me about it, because I love trolls.
[3470.76 → 3471.88] All right, guys.
[3471.88 → 3472.60] It's been a blast.
[3472.60 → 3473.24] Take it easy.
[3473.24 → 3474.04] All right, take care.
[3474.04 → 3474.44] See ya.
[3476.20 → 3481.64] Okay, so I hope I emailed myself the thing that I need here.
[3481.64 → 3485.40] Let's go ahead and, oh, yeah, yeah, apparently I did.
[3485.40 → 3488.52] When show lower third, going to download this.
[3488.52 → 3492.20] I thought I had done this before the show, but apparently I did not.
[3492.20 → 3497.32] So I'm going to go ahead and put that where it's supposed to go, which is on the desktop.
[3497.32 → 3500.04] Why don't you do a rapid fire topic in the meantime.
[3500.04 → 3501.08] Go, go, go.
[3501.08 → 3501.64] Whoa.
[3501.64 → 3502.36] Do, do, do, do.
[3502.36 → 3504.28] I'm nowhere near any rapid fire topics.
[3505.32 → 3506.04] Well, you should be more prepared.
[3506.04 → 3507.24] That's not a rapid fire topic.
[3507.24 → 3510.20] Because apparently the lack of preparation here was your fault.
[3510.20 → 3511.32] This is not, no.
[3511.32 → 3511.64] Okay.
[3511.64 → 3513.40] Black Friday was kind of nuts.
[3513.40 → 3513.96] We know that.
[3513.96 → 3516.76] There were 15 injuries and one death this year.
[3516.76 → 3522.52] But just to add to that, there were tons of huge protests, which were protesting against stores
[3522.52 → 3525.32] like Walmart and chains like McDonald's.
[3526.44 → 3530.76] And there was a massive amount of arrests at these protests.
[3530.76 → 3539.72] Over 110 arrested as record Black Friday protests challenge Walmart and major retailers on low wages.
[3539.72 → 3541.80] So this is from democracynow.org.
[3541.80 → 3548.68] So in addition to the protests, there was, I believe, one death this year, 15 injuries, and then 110 arrests.
[3548.68 → 3552.68] So another successful Black Friday.
[3552.68 → 3553.48] Black Friday.
[3553.48 → 3556.84] Heartwarming community pulling together Black Friday.
[3556.84 → 3560.12] I mean, the whole, ugh, I don't know what to say.
[3560.12 → 3561.96] Shop online, ladies and gentlemen.
[3561.96 → 3563.24] Yeah, shop online, exactly.
[3563.64 → 3567.88] I don't know what to say about the whole wages argument with stores like Walmart.
[3568.04 → 3571.40] Because people are upset, and yet they work there.
[3571.96 → 3575.64] People are upset, and yet they shop there.
[3576.12 → 3576.32] Yeah.
[3577.56 → 3578.72] The shop their thing.
[3579.48 → 3581.38] The work there thing, they might not be able to get another job.
[3581.40 → 3582.32] Yeah, there might not be another option.
[3582.40 → 3586.14] Because the store coming in might have closed down so many stores around it that there's not enough jobs.
[3586.14 → 3590.00] But everyone has, you know, the option to shop somewhere else.
[3590.00 → 3590.40] Yes.
[3590.40 → 3591.28] Unless they don't.
[3591.28 → 3591.76] Unless they can afford it.
[3591.76 → 3593.88] Because they work at Walmart, and they don't make enough money.
[3595.08 → 3598.16] So how do we ever address this?
[3598.48 → 3600.60] If you're not willing to pay more...
[3600.60 → 3601.66] There's minimum wage laws.
[3601.78 → 3602.00] Yes.
[3602.20 → 3603.54] Which is what they're fighting for, I believe.
[3603.82 → 3607.72] And they're fighting against Walmart firing people illegally.
[3608.24 → 3609.38] Okay, that's a big problem.
[3609.38 → 3611.46] But the whole minimum wage laws things.
[3611.56 → 3613.92] I mean, we had a minimum wage hike here not that long ago.
[3614.20 → 3620.80] And it hasn't done anything to address the constant increase in cost of living.
[3620.98 → 3621.78] I mean, it...
[3621.78 → 3622.76] It wasn't enough.
[3622.92 → 3623.80] It wasn't enough.
[3623.98 → 3629.44] They're talking in, I believe it was in this article, it might be a different one, about how they need a wage increase to $15 an hour.
[3629.44 → 3636.26] And, like, that's probably not going to happen because it's probably not quite, but a little bit under double.
[3636.76 → 3637.06] Yeah.
[3637.34 → 3644.66] And convincing huge companies like Walmart that they're not going to spend billions in lobbying dollars to make that not happen is going to be interesting.
[3644.66 → 3649.68] Something that people have to understand, too, is that payroll is extremely expensive.
[3649.90 → 3652.02] People are phenomenally expensive.
[3652.86 → 3661.48] And to operate a business like Walmart, where people expect to come in and buy a box of cereal for $2 or whatever it happens to be,
[3662.32 → 3666.26] the people involved in that box of cereal, okay?
[3666.26 → 3670.24] So, first, to, like, grow grain, okay?
[3670.78 → 3673.38] Then, to take that and turn that into cereal.
[3673.98 → 3675.68] Then, to package that.
[3676.00 → 3677.92] Then, to transport it somewhere.
[3678.30 → 3679.66] Then, to transport it somewhere else.
[3679.72 → 3681.02] And then probably somewhere else.
[3681.18 → 3687.10] And then, finally, to pick it up on a pallet, take it out onto a store floor, and then put it on a shelf.
[3687.44 → 3692.32] Then, finally, to have someone take it off, bring it to the cashier, and ring it up for you.
[3692.32 → 3703.14] The number of times that gets touched, the fact that you can buy anything for $2 or $3 means that nobody, anywhere in that line, was getting paid $15 an hour.
[3705.56 → 3706.36] The truck driver.
[3707.42 → 3708.12] Truck driver.
[3708.28 → 3708.86] Probably was.
[3709.00 → 3709.80] The guy that flew the plane.
[3711.00 → 3713.04] But you don't ship cereal by air.
[3713.46 → 3715.12] Okay, the guy that...
[3715.12 → 3718.24] Okay, the truck driver, perhaps.
[3718.46 → 3718.78] The boat.
[3720.50 → 3721.22] Probably not.
[3721.22 → 3722.24] If it was on a boat.
[3722.48 → 3723.58] Yeah, maybe not.
[3723.58 → 3724.66] If it's in the States, maybe not.
[3724.72 → 3725.20] Yeah, probably not.
[3725.46 → 3727.72] Anyway, okay, maybe someone did.
[3727.74 → 3728.00] Warehouse workers.
[3728.18 → 3729.32] But the point is that nobody...
[3730.04 → 3730.98] In Walmart.
[3731.36 → 3735.02] Nobody in Walmart made over $15 an hour.
[3735.02 → 3739.42] And if they did, that box of cereal would cost more.
[3740.18 → 3743.70] So, there's no clear solution here, I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[3744.04 → 3745.72] But, yeah.
[3746.30 → 3746.96] That sucks.
[3747.56 → 3748.52] That's really depressing.
[3749.28 → 3750.92] That's a depressing news topic.
[3750.92 → 3753.70] Black Friday is not, like, a happy holiday.
[3753.96 → 3754.20] No.
[3754.74 → 3755.56] Um, yeah.
[3755.72 → 3756.14] I don't know.
[3756.34 → 3756.56] Okay.
[3756.64 → 3758.20] So, let's go into our...
[3758.20 → 3758.68] That's a really...
[3758.68 → 3761.54] We could probably talk about that topic for another hour and a half.
[3761.62 → 3761.90] Yeah.
[3763.02 → 3764.64] There's probably a limit to how long we should.
[3764.64 → 3768.56] I don't know how far I want to go into my hatred for big box stores.
[3769.68 → 3770.34] But, yeah.
[3770.50 → 3771.70] I wish everything was small.
[3772.04 → 3772.74] Mom and pops.
[3773.36 → 3774.30] People could make more money.
[3774.74 → 3777.50] People could make more money, but then they wouldn't...
[3777.50 → 3779.90] They'd charge more money for things, but then scale is a thing.
[3780.06 → 3780.20] Yeah.
[3780.20 → 3782.72] And everyone wants to have, like, each of the...
[3782.72 → 3786.98] If people were willing to buy a cell phone once every four years, and people were willing
[3786.98 → 3792.08] to not overbuy things, they could afford to pay a higher markup and people would make
[3792.08 → 3792.62] living wages.
[3792.78 → 3795.34] But I think it's ultimately the consumer that drives this.
[3795.70 → 3796.00] It's...
[3796.00 → 3796.18] Yeah.
[3796.30 → 3797.84] It's not just Walmart's problem.
[3797.98 → 3801.80] And, like, they talk about how you drop a Walmart somewhere and every single mom and
[3801.80 → 3802.44] pop disappears.
[3802.74 → 3802.92] Yeah.
[3803.84 → 3807.68] If people kept doing what they're doing before the Walmart got there, the Walmart would disappear.
[3808.00 → 3808.42] Yes, it would.
[3808.56 → 3809.02] So it's not...
[3809.02 → 3810.54] It's a mixture of problems.
[3810.70 → 3814.94] And it's not just the consumers either, but then it's not just Walmart either.
[3815.20 → 3817.76] I mean, there are other problems with the consumer mentality as well.
[3817.84 → 3819.14] This was a fascinating article.
[3819.14 → 3824.70] I wish I remember where I read it now, but it was about Black Friday and retailer margins.
[3824.92 → 3830.00] Now, this isn't as true for electronics retailers, but it's very true for retailers and industries
[3830.00 → 3836.74] where there typically is excellent margin, like cosmetics or clothing or shoes, where
[3836.74 → 3840.28] what happens is Black Friday is the...
[3840.28 → 3845.92] I believe the discount level compared to five years ago had increased by 36%.
[3845.92 → 3846.68] True.
[3846.78 → 3849.94] But the actual retailer margins were identical.
[3850.94 → 3857.94] But there were a couple retailers that talked about trying to go straight, you know, good
[3857.94 → 3863.42] everyday pricing versus having a high markup so that people think that that Coach bag is
[3863.42 → 3864.20] worth $400.
[3864.60 → 3865.26] Like that's...
[3865.26 → 3868.52] Honestly, Coach is the brand that baffles me more than any other one.
[3868.58 → 3868.68] Okay.
[3868.70 → 3869.74] I'll talk about Coach later.
[3870.46 → 3875.46] But basically what they found was that when they tried to go everyday low price, people
[3875.46 → 3876.20] just stopped buying.
[3877.28 → 3880.42] They just stopped buying because they wanted to feel like they were getting a deal.
[3880.42 → 3883.06] And that's what stores like Walmart do.
[3883.14 → 3888.84] That's what Big Box does so well is they have a high price that nobody ever actually pays.
[3888.98 → 3891.00] And then they make you feel like you're getting a deal.
[3891.16 → 3893.22] And then they sell it for a lower margin.
[3893.48 → 3895.36] And then they don't pay their people very much.
[3895.42 → 3899.72] And then it's all this ecosystem that is just horrible.
[3900.00 → 3902.98] Anyway, so Coach, they're not even made of leather.
[3902.98 → 3905.78] Like you walk into this store.
[3905.98 → 3906.08] Okay.
[3906.20 → 3912.32] So like Coach has dedicated stores, Coach outlet stores, where the pricing is lower.
[3912.56 → 3912.96] Wow.
[3913.04 → 3913.68] It's lower.
[3913.82 → 3916.02] So why doesn't everybody go to the outlet store?
[3916.22 → 3920.66] Why do you ever go to the marked up more than the other one store?
[3920.80 → 3925.04] Like how does this figure in people's brains?
[3925.10 → 3926.76] It's like, oh, oh, Coach bag.
[3926.98 → 3927.14] Wow.
[3927.16 → 3927.74] That's really nice.
[3927.74 → 3931.90] Coach bags are expensive, except they're never expensive because they're always at the outlet
[3931.90 → 3932.32] store.
[3932.98 → 3935.64] They're not actually worth anything.
[3935.94 → 3937.28] They're just, they're plastic.
[3937.74 → 3938.62] Like I was picking it up.
[3938.70 → 3940.42] I was like, I was like, it's $30.
[3940.74 → 3942.12] And again, it's that discount mentality.
[3942.16 → 3943.64] Some guys like Linus boyfriend tips.
[3944.50 → 3946.70] Marked down from $60.
[3947.28 → 3950.08] And I'm like, okay, well, A, this was never worth $60.
[3950.46 → 3954.66] And B, it's not worth $30 because it's made of vinyl.
[3954.96 → 3956.16] Do you know how much vinyl is worth?
[3956.54 → 3958.80] It doesn't even have any music printed on it.
[3959.00 → 3962.28] That's the only time that it's worth it to pay $30 for a piece of vinyl.
[3962.98 → 3963.98] Oh man.
[3964.34 → 3966.12] Why does anyone pay for this crap?
[3966.12 → 3974.28] Like I have no problem with high-end stuff, but make it out of something high end.
[3974.38 → 3974.86] Okay.
[3975.06 → 3979.70] Make a nice purse, make it out of leather and frigging put gold on it.
[3979.76 → 3980.08] Okay.
[3980.78 → 3981.34] Fine.
[3981.34 → 3987.10] You want to charge $20,000 for a phone that has like diamonds on it, whatever.
[3987.44 → 3989.38] You put Swarovski crystals on it.
[3990.64 → 3991.04] What?
[3991.84 → 3995.60] It's like, oh no, this, this glass is really different from the other glass.
[3995.60 → 4000.62] So, yeah, there's like a goose and it's a logo.
[4002.20 → 4002.56] Unbelievable.
[4002.84 → 4003.08] Anyway.
[4004.12 → 4004.86] Oh, jeez.
[4004.88 → 4006.34] I think we should move on to our next topic.
[4006.44 → 4008.06] So, so was that fuelled by something?
[4008.44 → 4008.74] Oh yeah.
[4008.80 → 4009.76] No, I was at the coach outlet.
[4010.24 → 4012.12] Um, I was at the coach outlet with my wife.
[4012.20 → 4013.20] We were buying Christmas presents.
[4013.90 → 4014.90] And she thinks it's stupid too.
[4015.14 → 4016.14] She didn't buy one for herself.
[4016.30 → 4017.20] No, I, I, yeah.
[4017.30 → 4018.12] No, I was just there.
[4018.20 → 4019.44] And like, there's this, okay.
[4019.60 → 4021.12] Oh, see, you're getting me going on this again.
[4021.12 → 4024.86] So there's like a pre Black Friday, I think it, oh, what's it called?
[4026.48 → 4027.26] Hayes or something?
[4027.26 → 4031.12] Like it, like, it's like a pre Black Friday event at the mall, and you can go to the coach
[4031.12 → 4032.48] outlet and there's like, there was a lineup.
[4032.58 → 4032.78] Okay.
[4032.78 → 4035.36] There was a lineup at the coach outlet to get in.
[4035.64 → 4038.94] And it's like 40% off.
[4038.98 → 4039.20] Okay.
[4039.28 → 4040.46] And here's another thing, guys.
[4040.56 → 4047.50] Anytime a retailer tells you 40% off means that they had 40% margin at some point, unless
[4047.50 → 4051.88] it's like a very exceptional deal on one thing, and it's a close out.
[4051.98 → 4052.06] Okay.
[4052.16 → 4057.68] So for example, electronics, NCI is warehouse sales where they mark things down 40% and they
[4057.68 → 4063.62] go, yeah, well, this is the one that's 40% off, and its like got a scratch on it and it
[4063.62 → 4064.68] was returned by someone already.
[4064.76 → 4065.12] But don't worry.
[4065.18 → 4066.28] We check to make sure it works.
[4066.86 → 4072.36] That is because they can't afford to give you 40% off on the entire inventory in the back
[4072.36 → 4075.10] because they'd be losing hundreds or thousands of dollars.
[4075.10 → 4077.56] That is an exceptional deal.
[4078.02 → 4080.62] An exceptional deal has to be an exception.
[4081.28 → 4087.34] When you walk into a store, and it's buy one, get one for 50% off, that means that each of
[4087.34 → 4093.44] those pairs of shoes must have had 25% margin at least.
[4094.12 → 4094.72] At least.
[4096.30 → 4099.68] And that's all they gave you was the money that they at least had.
[4099.74 → 4102.70] They definitely had more because shoes are not actually worth anything.
[4102.70 → 4108.84] Unless, okay, so let's talk about maybe very well-crafted steel-toed work boots that are
[4108.84 → 4113.24] made of leather and have soles that are like super awesome rubber that doesn't slip when
[4113.24 → 4114.14] you're walking around on roofs.
[4114.26 → 4116.42] Those are shoes that are actually worth something.
[4116.74 → 4120.12] Shoes that are made of vinyl or plastic are not worth anything.
[4120.34 → 4124.60] And if you feel like buy one, get one 50% off as a deal, then you need to re-examine
[4124.60 → 4125.16] math.
[4125.16 → 4129.22] I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[4132.22 → 4134.02] I probably shouldn't have pushed you more.
[4134.22 → 4134.72] I could.
[4134.92 → 4135.70] I could definitely push you more.
[4135.70 → 4136.60] Nope, we're not doing it anymore.
[4136.80 → 4136.96] Okay.
[4137.36 → 4138.22] So, all right.
[4138.34 → 4141.36] I've had the Squarespace lower third down here for like five minutes.
[4141.80 → 4142.04] Okay.
[4142.14 → 4146.28] So guys, squarespace.com, the easy way to create your own website.
[4146.48 → 4148.90] You can get a free trial at squarespace.com.
[4148.90 → 4154.58] And if you use offer code Linus12, you can get 10% off your first paid membership.
[4154.76 → 4158.40] So the way Squarespace works is you pick one of their templates of which they have over
[4158.40 → 4158.74] 20.
[4158.86 → 4165.84] They're optimal for things like blogs or portfolios or little storefronts or all kinds of cool
[4165.84 → 4166.62] stuff like that.
[4166.74 → 4167.88] You pick one of their templates.
[4168.08 → 4169.56] You go ahead and build out your website.
[4169.76 → 4174.00] You can either use their builder or you can dive into the code, and you can play around with
[4174.00 → 4175.02] it yourself if you want.
[4175.02 → 4179.78] If you buy a full year's membership, they will actually throw in a domain for you.
[4179.92 → 4182.62] So they'll go ahead, and they'll cover the cost of you to acquire a domain.
[4183.14 → 4186.10] And then you just pay your monthly membership, and it's got scalable plans.
[4186.30 → 4191.40] So, you know, if you were to head over to linusmediagroup.com, you would see what a Squarespace website
[4191.40 → 4195.08] that we spent less than a day on actually looks like.
[4195.14 → 4200.36] So it is relatively easy to use, and it looks a lot nicer than things like WordPress, unless
[4200.36 → 4205.16] you're willing to put a lot of work into work, like endless work into WordPress.
[4205.28 → 4208.64] Because the great thing about Squarespace is it runs not only really well on your desktop,
[4208.88 → 4212.38] but also on mobile devices like tablets and phones without any modding.
[4212.44 → 4215.78] All of their themes are already set up for it to work on everything.
[4215.96 → 4219.06] So guys, Squarespace is a proud sponsor of the WAN show.
[4219.06 → 4222.08] And we'd love for you to give it a try.
[4222.50 → 4224.66] Like if you just, that's all I'm asking you to do.
[4224.86 → 4226.48] Take advantage of that 10% margin.
[4227.12 → 4227.86] Yeah, exactly.
[4229.08 → 4230.02] The point.
[4232.94 → 4234.44] We're talking software.
[4235.10 → 4237.90] Software doesn't actually even have a bomb cost.
[4238.42 → 4243.12] So if we're going to talk about, if we're going to talk about margin structures, and you know this,
[4243.34 → 4247.82] software is not comparable to things like that at all.
[4247.94 → 4248.58] I had to.
[4248.58 → 4249.02] I was.
[4251.64 → 4255.24] Anyway, if nothing else, you can try out the free trial.
[4255.40 → 4257.06] You can have a website for two weeks.
[4257.16 → 4258.18] You can play around with it.
[4258.22 → 4259.36] You can see if it works for you.
[4259.40 → 4262.08] And if it does, or it doesn't, then you don't have to keep going with it.
[4262.10 → 4264.26] But if you do, use offer code Linus12.
[4264.26 → 4267.14] You can save 10% and then be happy.
[4268.36 → 4269.84] With your margin.
[4270.00 → 4274.16] With your margin that they have worked into their business because they're smart.
[4274.16 → 4278.98] Just like when we quote someone like Squarespace, how much it costs to do this integration spot,
[4278.98 → 4284.08] and we say, oh, well, we'll give you, you know, 10% off if you do 10 of them.
[4284.20 → 4286.04] That means that we have at least 10% margin.
[4286.24 → 4286.80] If you type in Linus1.
[4287.00 → 4288.34] If you type in Linus1.
[4289.20 → 4290.92] On our purchasing portal.
[4291.12 → 4291.62] Yeah, exactly.
[4291.94 → 4294.06] I think we can use our own offer code.
[4294.72 → 4296.58] No, I mean when they're buying from us.
[4296.94 → 4297.22] Oh.
[4297.28 → 4298.40] Maybe they have to give them an offer code.
[4298.40 → 4299.06] Or Squarespace1.
[4299.60 → 4300.14] Squarespace1.
[4300.14 → 4300.96] Here's your 10% off.
[4300.96 → 4301.92] Well, that'll be for January.
[4302.18 → 4302.56] Oh, okay.
[4302.72 → 4303.00] All right.
[4303.08 → 4305.10] So let's go to our next topic here.
[4306.34 → 4310.02] Toshiba acquires OCC's assets for $35 million.
[4310.14 → 4312.50] This was posted by James underscore AJ on the forum.
[4312.90 → 4314.24] The original article is from Anand Tech.
[4314.34 → 4318.76] Speaking of Anand Tech, Anand Laosimpy will be our guest on the WAN show next week.
[4319.04 → 4319.52] Sweet.
[4319.86 → 4322.46] The Anand from Anand Tech.
[4322.46 → 4325.32] So I could probably just leave the room.
[4325.66 → 4328.88] Probably because he's a pretty good talker.
[4328.88 → 4331.92] I'm literally probably just going to type in Twitch chat for the entire time.
[4332.12 → 4336.28] You guys should see the unreleased video that's on my maybe not working right now phone.
[4336.68 → 4341.36] Of Linus tailing Anand for so long at Computer.
[4341.48 → 4343.06] I have the whole thing recorded.
[4343.08 → 4343.96] I'm sort of a fan.
[4344.78 → 4348.66] So I've read almost every article he's ever written.
[4348.96 → 4350.00] And like all that kind of stuff.
[4350.00 → 4351.40] He's super knowledgeable.
[4351.66 → 4352.52] Super smart.
[4352.68 → 4354.48] Very well respected in the industry.
[4354.82 → 4357.00] And I'm really excited to have him on the show next week.
[4357.00 → 4359.90] So anyway, this was written by Christian over at Anand Tech.
[4360.50 → 4368.84] And basically, I guess, the long and the short of it is, they acquired OCT for $35 million.
[4369.14 → 4373.74] It's unclear right now exactly what's going to be done with the brand itself.
[4374.08 → 4376.08] Exactly what's going to be done with the people themselves.
[4376.32 → 4378.30] I actually pinged a couple of people I know at OCT.
[4378.44 → 4379.82] I'm fairly well-connected over there.
[4379.90 → 4380.32] I love those guys.
[4380.32 → 4382.56] It says in this article that the people are...
[4382.56 → 4383.44] They're supposed to retain them.
[4384.12 → 4385.20] Who knows, right?
[4385.30 → 4387.08] Who knows what actually happens in the longer term.
[4387.18 → 4389.42] Or like what kind of jobs they end up doing.
[4389.54 → 4399.36] Because if they don't continue the OCT brand, then they could make them all janitors for Toshiba, you know, North America or something.
[4399.50 → 4402.04] Like I don't know exactly what the terms are.
[4402.04 → 4415.12] And so for $35 million, to put that in perspective, OCT spent $32 million acquiring In delinks with controller IP and all their engineers and all the assets that came along with that.
[4415.36 → 4418.46] So In delinks is an SSD controller company.
[4418.86 → 4424.64] Now Toshiba turns around and acquires OCT in its entirety, including those assets, for $35 million.
[4424.90 → 4428.44] So you could say they bought OCT on sale and there was a lot of margin.
[4428.60 → 4429.32] There wasn't margin.
[4429.42 → 4430.22] They lost a lot of money.
[4430.22 → 4432.36] There was a lot of margin when OCT bought In delinks.
[4432.50 → 4433.02] They lost a lot.
[4434.48 → 4435.34] No, I think that was probably...
[4435.34 → 4437.20] OCT went shopping at the mom-and-pop store.
[4437.24 → 4438.60] Okay, you know that isn't the same thing.
[4438.62 → 4439.56] And Toshiba went shopping at Walmart.
[4439.58 → 4441.08] I'm not talking about that anymore.
[4441.30 → 4442.58] I'm not talking about it anymore.
[4442.96 → 4445.82] So Toshiba gets a couple great benefits here.
[4445.82 → 4449.36] Number one is they get any IP that In delinks owns, which is great.
[4449.74 → 4453.70] Number two is they get the OCT brand if they do decide that they want it.
[4453.76 → 4457.48] Right now they've said that they will be honouring warranties, at least until the acquisition is complete.
[4457.48 → 4461.34] But after that, I don't think we know exactly what's going to happen.
[4462.72 → 4464.24] So that's a little bit tricky.
[4464.38 → 4467.14] And I did promise to talk about this on the WAN show a little bit.
[4468.28 → 4473.52] Anyone who didn't see this coming probably didn't know anything about OCT's business.
[4473.52 → 4478.38] And I hear from consumers a lot about why they think OCT went out of business.
[4478.68 → 4480.84] And it really isn't those things.
[4480.94 → 4482.00] It has nothing to do with that.
[4482.06 → 4484.34] They're like, well, I had an OCT drive and it died.
[4484.48 → 4486.26] So, they're a bad company.
[4486.34 → 4486.90] And that's why they went...
[4486.90 → 4488.94] No, that's not why they went out of business at all.
[4489.08 → 4492.38] The reason they went out of business was complete and utter mismanagement.
[4492.38 → 4493.58] I mean, I would...
[4493.58 → 4495.30] This is going back to my NCI days.
[4495.42 → 4500.52] I would buy, you know, let's say, a thousand OCT SSDs of a particular model.
[4500.84 → 4505.62] And I would say, guys, I don't think I can move a thousand of these within my normal 30-day terms.
[4505.88 → 4507.94] And they would say, Linus, don't worry about it.
[4507.98 → 4508.88] We'll extend your terms.
[4508.98 → 4510.48] You can have 90-day terms.
[4510.54 → 4513.98] And I'd say, well, I don't think I can move these within 90 days because it's not a very good deal.
[4514.18 → 4515.90] And they'd say, don't worry about it.
[4515.94 → 4518.68] We'll give you instant rebates after the fact.
[4518.68 → 4525.12] So basically what OCT was doing was they were booking the revenue because I was giving them a PO, and they were shipping me the drives.
[4525.34 → 4531.00] But then they were never actually intending to collect that money in its entirety.
[4531.50 → 4535.76] Because they were going to give me discounts after the fact before I ever paid them.
[4535.98 → 4539.84] So they were collecting that money, but they were, like, discounting it.
[4540.06 → 4540.76] Theoretical money.
[4540.90 → 4541.10] Yeah.
[4541.22 → 4542.30] They were collecting theoretical money.
[4542.30 → 4549.36] And because of the way that computer chip pricing works, it typically goes down over time.
[4549.44 → 4550.60] I'm going backwards for you guys.
[4550.64 → 4550.96] There we go.
[4551.02 → 4551.82] Down over time.
[4552.72 → 4562.46] By the time 90 days has passed, they have shipped me flash that was so expensive 90 days ago and is now very inexpensive.
[4562.88 → 4564.22] But they paid for it then.
[4564.42 → 4566.14] But I'm going to pay for it now.
[4566.14 → 4569.12] And they're going to have to keep discounting it to make sure that I can sell it.
[4569.86 → 4580.88] So obviously that business model was only going to work if they could sell me $10,000 the next time around so that when I gave them that order, they could put that on their books.
[4581.06 → 4582.92] And so it was never going to work.
[4582.98 → 4585.88] It never had anything to do with OCT having the most drive failures.
[4586.00 → 4586.32] You know what?
[4586.36 → 4587.78] They might have had the most drive failures.
[4587.92 → 4593.60] They were also number one market share in a lot of places for a long time.
[4593.66 → 4595.10] They were selling a lot of drives.
[4595.10 → 4600.28] And when someone's selling 100 and someone else is selling 10, you're going to see 10 complaining customers.
[4600.42 → 4602.66] Let's say there was a 10% failure rate, which there isn't.
[4602.88 → 4605.86] But you'd have 10 complaining customers here versus one here.
[4606.08 → 4608.02] That starts to add up, right?
[4608.76 → 4615.48] So the idea was they had to keep on selling larger and larger orders forever if they wanted to stay in business forever.
[4615.78 → 4622.82] Unless they got to the point where they had such enormous momentum that someone acquired them, which was rumoured to happen for a while there.
[4622.82 → 4631.94] Or they got such enormous momentum that they could scale back the discounting, and they would be able to retain a reasonable sales volume, and they would be able to make money.
[4631.94 → 4648.32] But that was never going to happen because SSDs went from being a performance enthusiast type device to being completely commodity and dominated by guys like Samsung who own fabs and who own controller technology and all this stuff and can just sell it at whatever margin.
[4648.40 → 4654.14] They don't care because they can sell themselves the flash, make money there, and they could sell drives at a loss for all they care.
[4654.14 → 4660.16] You'll never be able to compete with those guys by putting a shiny gold heat spreader on something once it becomes a commodity item.
[4660.72 → 4662.70] And with SSDs, it happened very quickly.
[4662.84 → 4672.62] It went from like Vertex, black and silver label, to whatever, Crucial M4 with the ugliest label I've ever seen in my life.
[4673.14 → 4673.80] And nobody cares.
[4674.78 → 4677.36] Intel 520's like scratched metal back.
[4677.36 → 4687.08] So if they'd been able to have that boutique-y branding, and they'd been able to get margin back out of it after they had an enormous sales volume and great brand presence, then it might have worked.
[4688.10 → 4689.38] I mean, there were issues.
[4689.58 → 4691.34] I mean, they did release bunk products.
[4691.44 → 4693.28] I think it was the Petrol?
[4693.94 → 4694.18] Oh.
[4694.52 → 4695.06] I can't remember.
[4695.14 → 4696.94] There was one that had like a 40% RMA rate.
[4696.98 → 4697.52] It was ridiculous.
[4697.52 → 4700.66] But a lot of their stuff was very solid.
[4700.78 → 4706.46] But being a smaller company, they often couldn't validate things to the same extent that someone like Intel will spend a year validating a drive.
[4708.00 → 4708.18] Yeah.
[4708.28 → 4708.56] Nope.
[4708.60 → 4709.16] We're going to make sure.
[4709.58 → 4709.80] Yeah.
[4710.40 → 4712.16] But Toshiba might be able to do that.
[4712.78 → 4716.20] But Toshiba already sells SSDs under their own name.
[4717.12 → 4719.14] I'd be very interested to see Toshiba.
[4719.30 → 4722.50] To be clear, I mean, I had a couple of people comment on, well, Toshiba's so small.
[4722.64 → 4724.12] Like, how could they afford to buy OCT?
[4724.34 → 4724.72] Toshiba's not small.
[4724.72 → 4725.36] Or they're small.
[4725.36 → 4726.78] They're small in the SSD space.
[4726.78 → 4728.12] So I'm like, oh, no, they're not.
[4728.52 → 4731.10] Toshiba is a NAND flash manufacturer.
[4731.40 → 4736.04] They're small in the like, branded, labelled Toshiba SSD space.
[4736.06 → 4741.32] I mean, to be clear, guys, the size of a company is not always apparent at the surface.
[4741.48 → 4751.78] Like, you might look at companies that have a good brand name, but they're actually rebranding a product that's being produced by a much larger company that's selling to a bunch of different brands.
[4752.22 → 4754.88] Like, someone else made a comment that Data was tiny.
[4754.98 → 4755.78] Oh, no, they're not.
[4755.78 → 4756.22] Nope.
[4756.22 → 4758.22] They are an SSD manufacturer.
[4758.70 → 4761.58] They don't put a label on things and then sell it to you.
[4761.66 → 4764.22] They actually assemble and put the chips on PCBs.
[4764.22 → 4774.76] So they're not quite at the level of Toshiba, where they manufacture NAND flash to sell to guys like Data, who put it together, to sell to guys like, oh, I don't know, like, what would be a great example?
[4774.82 → 4775.44] Like Patriot.
[4775.44 → 4777.44] That's why they didn't survive in the SSD business.
[4777.44 → 4779.44] That's why they didn't survive in the SSD business, because they don't own fabs and they don't own manufacturing.
[4779.44 → 4783.44] So SSD wasn't going to work for them unless they were willing to invest all that money.
[4783.44 → 4785.44] And not everyone has that kind of money.
[4785.44 → 4786.44] Yeah.
[4786.44 → 4789.44] For instance, someone in the chat just said American Megatrends is not a small company.
[4789.44 → 4790.44] Yeah.
[4790.44 → 4791.44] There you go.
[4791.44 → 4799.44] Oh, speaking of not small companies, we actually have our sponsors sort of mostly lined up for CES.
[4799.44 → 4802.44] So huge thanks to NCI, who is our gold sponsor.
[4802.44 → 4806.44] If you guys are looking forward to our CES content, we are taking the whole team.
[4806.44 → 4811.44] So we're going to have me and Easel as one of our teams, and then we're going to have Luke and Brandon as our other team.
[4811.44 → 4816.44] So we're going to be covering as much of the show as we can possibly bring to you guys.
[4816.44 → 4818.44] And NCI is making it possible.
[4818.44 → 4821.44] And then, oh, wow, I'm drawing a complete blank on our second sponsor.
[4821.44 → 4825.44] Corsair is our silver sponsor, is our first silver sponsor.
[4825.44 → 4827.44] And then we're still talking to a couple of other guys.
[4827.44 → 4831.44] I'm harassing WD to see if they want to sponsor us to be there at the show.
[4831.44 → 4834.44] I think they do, but I think they have to do some paperwork or something.
[4834.44 → 4836.44] But we'll get back to you guys on the other ones.
[4836.44 → 4842.44] But so far, NCI and Corsair, huge shout out to you guys for making it possible for us to be there and bring all that content to the audience.
[4842.44 → 4843.44] Yeah.
[4843.44 → 4847.44] Oh, there is one other thing that I do want to call out before we move on.
[4847.44 → 4848.44] Sure.
[4848.44 → 4851.44] This is something that has, this is a video that's not released yet.
[4851.44 → 4852.44] Okay.
[4852.44 → 4854.44] So it's just going to be a teaser for now.
[4854.44 → 4857.44] We have a giveaway coming.
[4857.44 → 4858.44] Oh.
[4858.44 → 4860.44] Okay, I'll skip our intro.
[4860.44 → 4863.44] Funny, people complain about the intro length.
[4863.44 → 4864.44] That's what you do about it.
[4864.44 → 4865.44] Woo!
[4865.44 → 4866.44] Yeah, I'm driving!
[4866.44 → 4867.44] Awesome!
[4867.44 → 4868.44] Woo!
[4868.44 → 4869.44] Woo!
[4869.44 → 4870.44] Yeah!
[4870.44 → 4871.44] All right!
[4871.44 → 4873.44] So that's all I'm going to show you guys.
[4873.44 → 4874.44] But the video does go on.
[4874.44 → 4878.44] But I'm planning to release that probably sometime tonight or tomorrow morning.
[4878.44 → 4879.44] It's a giveaway.
[4879.44 → 4884.44] We're giving away a bunch of cool stuff, a full gaming peripheral prize pack, and some stinky footboards.
[4884.44 → 4885.44] So stay tuned for that.
[4885.44 → 4886.44] All right.
[4886.44 → 4887.44] All right.
[4887.44 → 4889.44] Here's our next big topic.
[4889.44 → 4890.44] Oh, guys.
[4890.44 → 4891.44] Actually, let's do a Twitter Blitz.
[4891.44 → 4892.44] Let's do it on the OCT Buyout.
[4892.44 → 4893.44] And on the TV.
[4893.44 → 4894.44] Oh, I'm going to show you guys.
[4894.44 → 4895.44] I'm going to show you guys.
[4895.44 → 4896.44] Woo!
[4896.44 → 4897.44] Yeah!
[4897.44 → 4898.44] All right!
[4898.44 → 4899.44] So that's all I'm going to show you guys.
[4899.44 → 4900.44] But the video does go on.
[4900.44 → 4901.44] And it's really.
[4901.44 → 4902.44] I'll see you guys.
[4902.44 → 4903.44] But I'm going to show you guys that we can try yeah I'm going to show them all up about
[4903.44 → 4904.44] my writing book out of war copies.
[4904.44 → 4905.44] Because just about uploading the content obviously I'm not opening it up.
[4905.44 → 4906.44] Te CLS to not leaks out for your YouTube videos all the time, it's just running down
[4906.44 → 4907.44] down one.
[4907.44 → 4908.44] But the question is that parts are accounting on display.
[4908.44 → 4909.44] The game is cool.
[4909.44 → 4910.44] Perfect!
[4910.44 → 4911.44] And, from your channel.
[4911.44 → 4912.44] It's ____dust hassle.
[4912.44 → 4913.44] All right!
[4913.44 → 4914.44] And, it sounds fantastic.
[4914.44 → 4915.44] And I'm happy to share books maybe I'm going to throw book out in the previous video.
[4915.44 → 4916.44] So that's The poked out is just a video, you can go decide whether
[4916.44 → 4917.44] all these videos are going to upload to your canvas.
[4917.44 → 4918.44] Now, there's also a video of the whole YouTube videos for that is that they do
[4930.44 → 4937.52] right there Hikers AMD FX processor socket AM3 plus are going to be continuing
[4937.52 → 4940.52] all the way to 2050 I suspect they'll just be EOL at some point this is just
[4940.52 → 4946.32] a placeholder because it's just going away so socket FM 2 plus is going to be
[4946.32 → 4950.58] getting refreshes on a yearly basis so we're going to get like 8,000 series
[4950.58 → 4955.56] graphics and like next-gen AMD Radeon next-gen AMD Radeon all this cool stuff
[4955.56 → 4961.26] DDR3 still DDR3 in 2015 hey that's interesting hey that might not be a bad
[4961.26 → 4965.76] move though yeah DDR to get better because your force probably going to well
[4965.76 → 4969.36] yeah the ER force probably not going to be super great at the beginning yeah it's
[4969.36 → 4974.58] not necessarily a bad idea mind you DDR4 would benefit onboard graphics because
[4974.58 → 4979.50] you'd have more bandwidth yeah but at a cost to latency, so I don't know I'll be
[4979.50 → 4982.80] interested to see if this is even real, but this is something that we've been
[4982.80 → 4987.96] talking about for a real long time guys I don't remember that like I don't
[4987.96 → 4991.74] remember the number of that WAN show but like we talked about it fairly in depth
[4991.74 → 4997.86] like a while ago yeah I was like back when we were in the garage so is there
[4997.86 → 5004.76] really any difference between AMD abandoning FX on the AM3 or AM3 plus
[5004.76 → 5009.68] whatever you want to call it the AM platform and Intel's current strategy
[5009.68 → 5013.76] where they haven't abandoned the high-end LGA 2011 platform in fact they
[5013.76 → 5016.46] they're going to continue to release processors there and there'll be six
[5016.46 → 5020.54] cores and eight cores and bazillion cores or whatever they're going to do, but it's
[5020.54 → 5026.72] not a focus no, and it comes out kind of whenever Bloomfield was released before
[5026.72 → 5032.96] Linfield so that was a 1366 platform that came out before the 1156 platform and
[5032.96 → 5037.46] that was the last time Intel led with an enthusiast grade product and then
[5037.46 → 5040.28] followed with a mainstream product since then they've been leading with
[5040.28 → 5044.24] mainstream and enthusiast has been as much as two processor architecture
[5044.24 → 5050.60] generations behind the in the mainstream product so when the Haswell launched we
[5050.60 → 5053.78] were still on Sandy Bridge E, and then we got Ivy Bridge E sort of little while
[5053.78 → 5058.94] later so is this really any different now consider this Intel's mainstream chips
[5058.94 → 5065.36] also have onboard graphics and AMD calls any CPU that has onboard graphics right on
[5065.36 → 5072.50] the die and APU so by AMD's definition the Intel mainstream ones are APUs so
[5072.50 → 5076.80] we're talking about oh AMD is abandoning the high-end well are they has Intel
[5076.80 → 5081.36] abandoned the high-end is the 4770 K not a high-end product from a gaming
[5081.36 → 5087.44] perspective I would argue it is I'd rather have an 8 core but is it not high-end
[5087.44 → 5092.36] enough for you, I don't know it's its interesting and like they're boasting
[5092.36 → 5098.78] some pretty fast chips too like not really slow there was more information
[5098.78 → 5102.74] outside just that chart which is like even more memory than that chart although
[5102.74 → 5107.84] that chart looks pretty official which was speccing out speeds I didn't
[5107.84 → 5112.58] include it in the notes because it was like pretty memory yeah I'm not sure how true it
[5112.58 → 5117.68] was, but they look pretty quick and if you look at like any build guide ever
[5117.68 → 5121.64] they're probably not running for the Intel side they're probably not running a
[5121.64 → 5126.80] 2011 socket CPU yeah because that's not super common so basically everything he
[5126.80 → 5129.98] just said yeah I don't think it's going to affect their business in any tangible way
[5129.98 → 5133.70] I think if they can deliver in fact I think it's great to see us going back to
[5133.70 → 5137.78] the one socket strategy I'm kind of tired of having two different sockets all over
[5137.78 → 5142.04] the place it's like between AMD and Intel we have four different sockets and
[5142.04 → 5149.48] that's the current gen only so we've got 2011 we've got 1150 we've got am3 or 3
[5149.48 → 5153.80] plus or whatever they want to call it, and then we've got FM2 or FM2 plus and then
[5153.80 → 5159.68] you can still buy LGA 1155 stuff which is like super relevant which is super
[5159.68 → 5164.00] relevant still because it performs just fine and then AMD has always got like two
[5164.00 → 5167.76] sockets trailing back so you can buy FM2 plus or FM2 and you can buy am3 plus or am3
[5167.76 → 5171.90] and then sometimes the CPUs are backwards compatible, and sometimes the sockets are
[5171.90 → 5175.08] backwards compatible, and I like if anything I think it's more confusing if we can go
[5175.08 → 5178.80] down to okay well we're going to ship only Apus they're going to have great onboard
[5178.80 → 5182.04] graphics, and you can use them, or you cannot and remember guys you don't have to use
[5182.04 → 5185.70] onboard graphics for graphics you can use them for compute as well so with HSA
[5185.70 → 5189.78] coming onboard graphics might become more and more relevant as time goes on and
[5189.78 → 5193.08] we might just see that whole thing is well this is a processor, and it's good at a
[5193.08 → 5196.02] lot of different things, and it might not matter that it's graphics cores CPU cores or
[5196.02 → 5200.70] cores or whatever else so if AMD starts to just deliver better processors that
[5200.70 → 5202.98] have all these things built into them, I don't I don't see an inherent problem with
[5202.98 → 5205.74] that, and it's all in one socket it's all easy if they can deliver more cores and
[5205.74 → 5209.10] that's great too I think it was interesting timing because for a while
[5209.10 → 5214.64] there honestly no one really seemed to care about AMD processors at all like I
[5214.64 → 5220.70] never saw them at all and then 8350 versus 3570k became this huge thing and then you
[5220.70 → 5224.16] saw AMD processors all over the place all of a sudden yeah I now and then now
[5224.16 → 5229.84] they're like that so it's just like if you did it before I would have maybe seen
[5229.84 → 5233.04] it was being realistic but then now you're doing it now when people are more
[5233.04 → 5239.22] interested in your product, but then I don't know cost a lot more to maintain
[5239.22 → 5242.88] two different platforms as well yeah another post from tech fanatic cry tech
[5242.88 → 5250.56] says we're evaluating mantle so here is the link to the source there you go there's a
[5250.56 → 5253.64] panel discussion so you guys can check that out it'll be posted in the WAN show
[5253.64 → 5259.02] document at any rate, and they don't just say they're evaluating it direct quote says
[5259.02 → 5265.76] where is it I can't really talk too much about mantle that's why, but then he goes in to talk about mantle pretty
[5265.76 → 5271.36] pretty seriously so to just get the elephant out of the room we're still evaluating mantle so we
[5271.36 → 5276.86] haven't made any clear decisions on that yet but we're taking a look at it, and it looks good so far
[5276.86 → 5281.80] very promising I mean when you consider that star citizen has already committed mantle support and
[5281.80 → 5290.10] this is a cry engine based game if cloud imperium and cry tech aren't somewhat going to like talk to each
[5290.10 → 5298.56] other about this that I'd be very surprised yeah I would be surprised to see and like AMD pulled in
[5298.56 → 5304.18] cloud imperium yeah I would be surprised to not see mantle implemented in cry engine at this point based
[5304.18 → 5309.84] on what we've read now yeah which is extremely exciting I mean mantle is still an unknown it's
[5309.84 → 5314.58] December I haven't seen a mantle patch for bf4 yet so I guess it's coming in a while maybe it'll be a
[5314.58 → 5319.92] Christmas present so it's still an unknown quantity, but it looks promising yeah well they
[5319.92 → 5324.18] both are to be honest like no one's really seen g-sync I know you have and like a few other people
[5324.18 → 5330.34] have but to mass consumers it's still a completely unknown okay, but it's not an unknown if someone
[5330.34 → 5337.98] knows it yeah whereas mantle everybody else who hasn't seen if it's an unknown okay so by your
[5337.98 → 5344.70] logic atoms are an unknown because only a few people have seen them so everyone else is just
[5344.70 → 5350.88] taking their word for it no that's totally invalid no it's not yes you can go see an atom okay fine
[5350.88 → 5355.36] then let's come up with something else that people can't see it doesn't matter the point is that if
[5355.36 → 5362.94] someone knows, and it's validated, but you can't properly explain it because no one has any idea what
[5362.94 → 5370.20] you're talking about okay, but that's different from something just plain old not existing, yet I'm
[5370.20 → 5379.50] not saying it's not existing I didn't say it wasn't okay any an unknown has to be unknown I am
[5379.50 → 5385.38] unidentified flying object isn't it properly explain it I people are saying air, and they have a good point
[5385.38 → 5391.24] but you can yeah kind of see that as well no you can see particles in it, and you can see the way it
[5391.24 → 5398.28] flows okay so hold on an unidentified flying object okay if somebody knows what it is and says yeah it's
[5398.28 → 5404.76] one of those it's not unidentified even if the person watching it was like what is that oh it's
[5404.76 → 5409.54] unidentified sure, but they still have not experienced it they don't know what it's like they know oh my god
[5409.54 → 5413.96] talking about g-sync okay g-sync you're you're blowing certain things in this well you did this to me
[5413.96 → 5420.26] earlier when with the whole margin thing that was completely different you were taking no it wasn't
[5420.26 → 5426.34] you were taking unrelated exam okay I actually I stand by this though an unknown has to be unknown
[5426.34 → 5430.88] to okay, but they don't understand they haven't seen it they haven't processed it is hasn't been
[5430.88 → 5435.08] properly explained by you or anyone else because people still don't understand what the hell it does
[5435.08 → 5441.90] well here I'll properly explain it right now then do it tearing goes away leg, but then we have to go
[5441.90 → 5445.52] into all the other concepts about it too because when you say that people are blowing other things
[5445.52 → 5448.86] well no, but that's the explanation that's what it does that's the that's the end of the rainbow
[5448.86 → 5454.58] that's the pot of gold is you sit down in front of your monitor and the delay that would normally
[5454.58 → 5459.30] exist when the GPU is finished drawing a frame and the monitor is not ready yet because it's on a fixed
[5459.30 → 5464.52] refresh rate that's gone and then the tearing that exists when you're when your frame rate exceeds
[5464.52 → 5469.44] the monitor's refresh rate is gone too so it's visually smooth that's all it's visually smooth yes that's all
[5469.44 → 5475.22] what is to say on any forum okay and no one has any idea what's going on people refusing to listen
[5475.22 → 5479.90] is not the same as something being unknown, but then they don't know it that doesn't mean it's
[5479.90 → 5486.36] unknown mantle is unknown by a large majority they've been talking about as well there's a
[5486.36 → 5489.48] difference they've been talking about how fast there's speed and there's a difference between
[5489.48 → 5493.74] something being unknown and some people being ignorant about it people are not the same mental
[5493.74 → 5497.24] people have talked about the speed increases they've talked about the've talked about the
[5497.24 → 5501.38] wishy-washy speed increases they've still talked about it, they've still explained how it is they
[5501.38 → 5506.56] had that huge stream all the reviewers talked about it so it's on equal levels so they're both
[5506.56 → 5512.30] known then which reviewers talked about it pc purr they have a battlefield 4 build that
[5512.30 → 5519.24] they've run they saw the I didn't say battlefield 4 they saw the mantle experiment thing that was a
[5519.24 → 5525.82] tech demo so what so it's a tech demo I've seen tech demos of physics that make it look like the
[5525.82 → 5530.84] next best thing for gameplay uh what was it borderlands made physics looks like the next best
[5530.84 → 5536.80] thing for gameplay, but that was BS too exactly it doesn't matter though I think we'll just have to
[5536.80 → 5542.72] agree to disagree on this one all right so Amazon is on the same level I was willing to move on I'm not
[5542.72 → 5549.34] well Amazon is testing drones for deliveries this was a big news article that absolutely exploded on
[5549.34 → 5556.18] the entire internet is it the truth is it the most clever marketing ruse in the entire history of
[5556.18 → 5561.40] marketing I don't think we're quite sure yet, but it was okay it was definitely good marketing we're
[5561.40 → 5566.06] just not sure if they're actually working on it yet because Amazon has everyone talking about them for
[5566.06 → 5574.24] free without paying a dime on the busiest chopping weekend in the United States so they're they've got to
[5574.24 → 5578.62] be working on it on some level if there's that Chinese company that's got it yes they're probably
[5578.62 → 5583.24] working on it on some level, but we still don't know that this is actually realistic so here's the
[5583.24 → 5589.26] original article from the BBC is the drones called octocopters could deliver packages weighing up to 2.3
[5589.26 → 5593.54] kilograms so that's about five pounds to customers within 30 minutes of them placing their order however
[5593.54 → 5597.88] he added that it could take up to five years for the service to start there are some complications so
[5597.88 → 5601.40] the U.S. federal aviation administration has approved the use of drones for police and government
[5601.40 → 5609.64] agencies, but they have not issued any permits for civilian use as yet um and that's not they're not
[5609.64 → 5616.02] they don't have to do anything about it until 2015 so Amazon can be experimenting and sort of talking
[5616.02 → 5620.94] about this all they want, but there won't be anything until 2015 at the very earliest unless the FAA just
[5620.94 → 5625.80] decides out of the goodness of their hearts that they're the FAA though yeah exactly so probably not
[5625.80 → 5628.36] well that's why I said the FAA and the goodness of their hearts
[5628.36 → 5636.00] they don't have those yeah, so there are a lot of problems that people have brought up like weather
[5636.00 → 5640.58] operating costs reliability potential vandalism thefts FAA regulations that was all stolen from an
[5640.58 → 5646.26] Aztec article yeah um but like well not to say well hold on let's not say stolen let's credit it
[5646.26 → 5653.58] so jarred Bolton from an Aztec wrote a very excellent piece about some of the challenges so challenge number
[5653.58 → 5659.56] one was I can't remember okay well there were a bunch of okay this was the one I liked the most
[5659.56 → 5666.64] okay as uh as their CEO noted they have around 300 items ordered every second on cyber mate
[5666.64 → 5670.92] that creates a lot of work for the shipment side of the business but even if Amazon tried to deliver
[5670.92 → 5676.86] only 10 of their packages by drone, and they were claiming that up to 86 of Amazon shipments could be
[5676.86 → 5681.96] handled by drone with respect to weight and distance okay so even if they tried to ship 10
[5681.96 → 5689.50] on such a busy day they'd be looking at 30 packages per second so they'd probably need uh okay a delivery
[5689.50 → 5693.60] time of about 20 minutes let's say if they're moving at high speed towards a target probably another 10
[5693.60 → 5701.10] minutes for refuelling and a drone fleet numbering 54 000 would be needed so if all orders were to be
[5701.10 → 5707.12] delivered by drones we'd be looking at 10 times that number over half a million drones I didn't read
[5707.12 → 5712.70] the part about distance being in there as well but I'm sure it's in there um but oh yeah they'd need
[5712.70 → 5717.12] warehouse locations within 10 miles of your office or residence to be yeah, so the distance was kind of
[5717.12 → 5723.84] an issue so because they don't have warehouse locations within 10 miles and the drones would need
[5723.84 → 5729.74] to be amazing to be able to go that fast I mean they'd need to not even just that fast a lot of drones
[5729.74 → 5735.24] I find don't go that quickly to operate with the precision to be able to like like i picture
[5735.24 → 5741.30] the death star and the millennium falcon being pulled in by the tractor beam, and then we need what
[5741.30 → 5748.48] was it 300 per second of them I mean it would be like a beehive oh well yeah, but that's also there
[5748.48 → 5753.70] isn't one shipping depot no there isn't one shipping depot, but it's a lot of, and they're saying within
[5753.70 → 5757.76] 10 000 whatever so it's like if they is you actually want to have that distance calculation as well
[5757.76 → 5763.48] it's like tons of them so they would need to have amazing collision detection they would I mean
[5763.48 → 5770.08] just to come in and land and be precise enough to you know go into whatever kind of dock that then
[5770.08 → 5774.46] probably carries it somewhere I mean they have amazing automation facilities inside their warehouses
[5774.46 → 5780.54] guys so for it to land on like a dock and then be carried on rails to the exact spot where it can pick
[5780.54 → 5785.88] up that thing and then be taking out to a to another dock that like that's totally realistic now but
[5785.88 → 5791.02] the precision with which they'd have to fly if anyone's ever flown an AR drone on a windy day
[5791.02 → 5796.30] for example it'll get taken off course quite easily these aren't again these are not air drones
[5796.30 → 5803.56] they're much better but i just they have eight um rotors I believe yeah eight rotors and probably
[5803.56 → 5807.66] better cameras and that's another thing adverse weather conditions I mean if they could fly by
[5807.66 → 5813.06] I don't know sonar then I guess it wouldn't be sonar it would be uh echolocation if they could fly
[5813.06 → 5817.50] by something like that I guess echolocation is kind of sonar um if they could fly with if they
[5817.50 → 5821.16] could fly by bouncing sound waves, and they could avoid obstacles that way then that would be kind
[5821.16 → 5828.18] of cool but if they relied online of sight I mean that would be kind of ridiculous not only just
[5828.18 → 5835.12] weather like what if someone puts up a tent what do you do yeah like those streets that have those
[5835.12 → 5841.24] like banner signs on their light poles yeah what if they just put those up like what happens and I mean
[5841.24 → 5848.52] that that that all even ignores like stupid people yeah I mean this is i I laughed when I saw it i
[5848.52 → 5854.76] really did but I was just like yeah it'll happen and aside from shipments being lost and these extremely
[5854.76 → 5860.36] expensive drones probably being damaged on a fairly regular basis um I mean what about the
[5860.36 → 5865.84] danger people shooting up in the air trying to take down drones because it will happen yep totally will
[5865.84 → 5871.40] happen and that bullet coming down and hitting someone it is no secret that what goes up must
[5871.40 → 5876.78] come down and what goes up at a speed that's enough to pierce skin and bones will come down at a speed
[5876.78 → 5881.06] that is enough to pierce skin and bones the bullet probably won't be going in a perfect line it might
[5881.06 → 5885.50] be flipping and stuff, but it's still going to cause damage yeah it'll still kill you if it hits you in
[5885.50 → 5895.52] the head you know it's a bullet, and it's going fast small metal object large velocity problem squishy target
[5895.52 → 5902.22] yeah all right so where was it fake I don't know there is a there's a there's a Chinese company
[5902.22 → 5908.16] yep and ups and FedEx have come out and said that they're looking into drone technology as well I mean
[5908.16 → 5913.92] they could reduce I mean see that makes more sense because and if it's longer shipping times
[5913.92 → 5917.36] not 30 minutes because then you could bring it there 's's ups and FedEx depots everywhere
[5917.36 → 5923.82] and here's the thing that kind of scares me is this race to lower costs and more automation
[5923.82 → 5931.18] and people again it comes back to the Black Friday protests employees it's like okay so you want to
[5931.18 → 5936.12] raise how about we take half of you and replace you with robots and the other half of you can all
[5936.12 → 5940.50] have a raise that was actually one of my notes on the Walmart thing is like they'll probably just fight
[5940.50 → 5946.60] this until they don't need employees anymore, and you know what at what point do we abandon
[5946.60 → 5954.16] the notion that everyone like the the the capitalist notion of everyone works and makes a
[5954.16 → 5960.20] fair wage and gets a minivan and a house in the suburbs and like sort of the American dream so to speak
[5960.20 → 5967.82] when do we abandon that because the machines really can do everything for us and we just kind of go okay
[5967.82 → 5975.20] well nobody really has to work anymore so why do we bother like is that is it it's its not really
[5975.20 → 5980.76] communism because it's not taking everyone and paying them the same for different jobs because
[5980.76 → 5983.04] would anyone even need really jobs any more it's
[5983.04 → 5985.80] and what's to make
[5985.80 → 5986.52] interesting conversation
[5986.52 → 5992.02] what's to make money on anymore if you don't pay anyone anything for anything because you don't need
[5992.02 → 5998.88] ups killers because you don't have self-driving trucks that deliver to depots that have you know
[5998.88 → 6001.14] maybe like one dude who
[6001.14 → 6007.96] loads the drone thing and fixes the drones and then though the drones carry everything everywhere else
[6007.96 → 6012.44] but then you're going to have a drone that fixes the drones and loads the drones and then a drone that
[6012.44 → 6015.88] fixes the other one, and they can fix each other just in case and at that point
[6015.88 → 6021.38] do we just take all the ups drivers and just go look I mean it doesn't cost anything to deliver packages
[6021.38 → 6028.74] anymore so you know here's some food and somewhere to stay and I mean no one will be that charitable so
[6028.74 → 6035.52] and then if no ups drivers buy like you know cool iPads than then what
[6035.52 → 6039.86] it's going to be a very interesting 20 years yeah
[6039.86 → 6043.50] all right what's our next topic
[6043.50 → 6052.38] uh the china shipments oh yeah jump right onto it sure so uh the biggest glaring problem I saw
[6052.38 → 6058.46] that with this right away is that so the FAA is stepping in front of the possible issues with drones
[6058.46 → 6063.80] in the states and making that probably not a possible issue for quite a while but china was like yeah go
[6063.80 → 6071.78] for it um as long as you get like regional aerial authority pass whatever the heck um so one shipping
[6071.78 → 6077.68] company there sf express is already jumping into it and starting basically now but a problem I have
[6077.68 → 6081.86] is in that picture it looks super clean and nice there but in a lot of different places in China
[6081.86 → 6086.76] there's so much smog that you can't really see anything um for reference we have another article
[6086.76 → 6093.24] here that we might, may or not bring up but um 20 million CCTV cameras were rendered basically useless
[6093.24 → 6099.56] because of the smog they can't see anything so if these drones are driven by vision like robotic vision
[6099.56 → 6106.34] what are they supposed to do if you can't see anything like that is it going to be predetermined
[6106.34 → 6111.60] paths are those paths going to have to be permanently cleared no matter what are they going to be seen
[6111.60 → 6116.28] through some other means like uh echolocation or something like that I mean this is the thing that
[6116.28 → 6122.10] concerns me about like I'd love to have a flying car, but the airspace is probably going to become
[6122.10 → 6128.50] congested faster than even the ground level roads did yeah with all the unmanned junk like I mean
[6128.50 → 6135.46] is like shacking into a drone in your car going to be just like you like oh I hit a like i
[6135.46 → 6141.38] hit a goose today holy crap like unusual but not unheard of I don't now and then what about the
[6141.38 → 6146.44] liability for all this yeah I mean maybe in China no cares were given here's the uh here's the smog
[6146.44 → 6151.08] thing maybe in China no cares were given about the liability because it's not land of the lawsuit
[6151.08 → 6157.36] like it is over here but like here that's like someone's there's going to be if you nudge someone
[6157.36 → 6164.80] in the head you will get sued for millions so what if a drone hits someone's car knocks the mirror off
[6164.80 → 6171.78] the mirror falls on their nephew who um you know like falls and like breaks his nose off or something
[6171.78 → 6179.18] like who's liable for this how much does it cost there's a lot of stuff to figure out, and you know
[6179.18 → 6185.24] the funny thing about it is the argument could be made like hey tough luck man I'm sorry it worked
[6185.24 → 6194.02] out that way but drones and self-driving cars have much lower um have much lower rates of error
[6194.02 → 6198.88] and collision and failure than the ones that were operated by humans so I'm sorry this worked out
[6198.88 → 6204.54] this way for you, but you know the goods of the many are the great they the needs of the many outweigh
[6204.54 → 6209.08] the needs of the few and overall for the greater good it's better that we do this way but then at
[6209.08 → 6215.00] the same time but what about me, I wouldn't have crashed the car I would have been I would have
[6215.00 → 6221.10] done better like there's a there's a lot of stuff to figure out over the next little bit here and like
[6221.10 → 6226.52] pointing at someone and saying well if this drone didn't hit you the guy driving the truck would have
[6226.52 → 6231.76] yeah you can't say that you can't say that that's not accurate, and you can't prove it in any way
[6231.76 → 6239.54] so it's kind of funky town all right so I was right micro USB is stupid, but they're making it
[6239.54 → 6243.20] like this I hope they make it more durable did you see they're planning on making it like the same size
[6243.20 → 6249.64] yeah, but size is fine I actually don't even mind the lightning connector they can make it more
[6249.64 → 6254.40] I'm just I'm just saying I hope they don't like completely mimic it so the next USB plug will
[6254.40 → 6261.34] finally be reversible the story was on the verge work has begun on the type c connector, so this is
[6261.34 → 6269.58] the only connector one will need across all devices one connector to rule them all uh and I mean yeah
[6269.58 → 6273.64] this is this is funny so they link to their article where they talk about the clumsy and
[6273.64 → 6281.30] oversized micro USB 3 port I mean micro USB 3 is ridiculous, so this will be an USB 3 standard
[6281.30 → 6287.02] connector so it'll be a super speed connector yeah I think this is just their review yeah where
[6287.02 → 6293.38] they talk about the like huge USB 3 port that's like massive and ridiculous I mean it's fast and
[6293.38 → 6299.20] that's great but I am super excited and I'm glad to see acknowledgement that I was right and micro USB
[6299.20 → 6303.28] stupid, and we need to move on to something else so it'll be small super thin
[6303.28 → 6309.98] reversible and hopefully will be the standard for phones of the future pretty cool actually pretty
[6309.98 → 6314.88] stoked for that um something I'm not necessarily pretty stoked for is something that I will never
[6314.88 → 6322.34] do which is buying a 1966 jaguar JJ 13 for 150 us well hold on a second if you could get a jaguar for
[6322.34 → 6329.74] 140 you would do it right the actual car yes grand tourism 6 coming to PlayStation 3 on Friday will
[6329.74 → 6339.98] allow you to buy an in-game car for 140 which is ridiculous I think the scale is even worse for
[6339.98 → 6346.00] euros which like that happens so much and like I'm sorry guys yeah but I hope you weren't going to buy this
[6346.00 → 6352.94] anyway yeah so to purchase it you would have to buy two seven and a half million dollar in-game
[6352.94 → 6361.10] packs so 140 total plus two of the other ones yeah and like there's i I watched the little
[6361.10 → 6366.28] video where it leaked what the cost of some of the cars are and there's quite a few that are in like
[6366.28 → 6371.66] the I think I didn't really do the math but I think it's about 50 dollar range how much was the
[6371.66 → 6375.02] seven and a half million dollar one because they're five million dollars I saw a ton that were five
[6375.02 → 6378.96] million seven and a half million hold on let me double-check seven and a half million points I mean
[6378.96 → 6384.14] seven and a half million points was uh 50 bucks so yeah I saw a bunch that were five forty
[6384.14 → 6388.36] dollar range so like forty dollar range cars there's a lot of them at what point do we stop
[6388.36 → 6395.82] calling microtransactions microtransactions let's see they're micro because of um they're easy
[6395.82 → 6400.00] and fast yeah and what you have to deal with and stuff they're not technically micro because of the
[6400.00 → 6407.46] cost okay, so there's still a microtransaction so I thought did you see my new coining no what do you
[6407.46 → 6413.52] what are you calling go go go MMT or massive microtransactions, so this game could be redefined
[6413.52 → 6420.60] as a meters a massive microtransactions racing simulation excellent that's exactly what we needed
[6420.60 → 6425.76] I love it you could have like MMT MMORPGs
[6425.76 → 6438.10] oh fantastic uh, so this is something that uh this is something that I personally am quite excited
[6438.10 → 6442.28] about although I don't know I don't think I can find the article right now can you do uh can you
[6442.28 → 6446.36] do a rapid fire topic let me just treat see if I can find this sure give me one quick second
[6446.36 → 6450.80] you have to find something we've covered most of our stuff we're actually 22 minutes over time yeah we
[6450.80 → 6454.34] should probably wrap it up pretty quick but I really want to talk about this so I don't I don't think
[6454.34 → 6458.62] we need to talk about this for too long because it happened to yahoo and google as well but NSA was
[6458.62 → 6464.04] just leaked about how they tapped into data centre interlinks at Microsoft so the links that go in
[6464.04 → 6468.90] between their big data centre buildings which are not too close to each other they've tapped into that
[6468.90 → 6473.14] and they're sniffing everything and Microsoft is pissed there's a quote of them saying these
[6473.14 → 6477.74] allegations are very disturbing if they are true these actions amount to hacking and seizure of
[6477.74 → 6481.50] private data and in our view a breach of the protection guaranteed by the fourth amendment
[6481.50 → 6487.60] of the constitution that was said by brad smith Microsoft's general counsel which is funny because
[6487.60 → 6492.50] they didn't really care too much when it was happening to us, and now they're super pissed that it's
[6492.50 → 6497.76] happening to them but I wonder if this is a good thing because now that we have stuff like people
[6497.76 → 6502.00] like Microsoft getting all angry about it maybe they're actually on our side now maybe something
[6502.00 → 6509.54] will actually happen because there weren't so much before like at all, so yeah all right let's go look
[6509.54 → 6514.76] at Linus's email new shield features I love shield I was wondering where I was supposed to find this
[6514.76 → 6519.98] yeah sorry it was in my email um so the game pad mapper so that's the feature that allows you to
[6519.98 → 6526.50] take NVIDIA shield um and map the physical buttons to touchscreen buttons so you can basically make
[6526.50 → 6532.80] any touchscreen control game a physically controlled game yes has been updated so you have the ability
[6532.80 → 6538.18] to share browse and rate community sourced game pad mapper profiles so you don't have to create your own
[6538.18 → 6542.78] you can just download the best rated game pad mapper profile that someone else created and boom you're
[6542.78 → 6547.18] in the game that also gives the ability to map gyro simulation to your thumb sticks which is cool
[6547.18 → 6551.02] it gives the right thumb stick a feature for first-person perspective games that use touch swipes
[6551.02 → 6558.02] to look around, and it adds a new accelerated cursor option for joystick mouse mode also they have added
[6558.02 → 6567.50] 1080p 60 fps support to the console mode as long as you're using an USB to gigabit Ethernet adapter which I have
[6567.50 → 6571.98] of course purchased yeah you have to get an on-the-go compatible one and I actually grabbed a hub as
[6571.98 → 6580.20] well so I grabbed uh a hub and then or an OTG cable yeah and a hub and then an USB to gigabit
[6580.20 → 6585.68] okay thing so that I can also plug in my Bluetooth controller nice I am so stoked I am just so stoked
[6585.68 → 6590.38] game stream works really well but for some reason there's some interference in my living room or
[6590.38 → 6594.30] something, and it doesn't work particularly well on my TV but in my kitchen is fine which is actually
[6594.30 → 6598.54] further from my router yeah that's weird yeah it's its bizarre my shield works fine there but in my
[6598.54 → 6602.68] living room it's bizarre so I'll run wired to the living room over power line okay and then I should
[6602.68 → 6611.76] have enough for 1080p on the TV oh I'm excited and NVIDIA also has opened up their uh oh bollocks what's
[6611.76 → 6618.06] it called yeah game stream uh using grid it's an open beta anyone with a shield with the latest
[6618.06 → 6623.18] software update just has a grid button I should bring one in so you can try it is works
[6623.18 → 6630.08] I posted on Instagram my connection speed which was optimal for it and there's some blockiness to
[6630.08 → 6636.06] the textures it's hardly perfect but streaming from Vancouver to NVIDIA server and Santa Clara
[6636.06 → 6641.32] was a playable gaming experience I was winning rounds in street fighter wow and I'm not a particularly
[6641.32 → 6646.06] good fighting game player so like I was and I was able to like to block things like the latency
[6646.06 → 6652.64] was not bad it was very playable not that noticeable, and it works that's interesting yeah
[6652.64 → 6657.42] that's fascinating it's fascinating I still don't, and it's free right now because it's
[6657.42 → 6662.12] beta yeah so you can anyone with a shield you can just play I think they've got uh dark sides
[6662.12 → 6667.96] dark sides 2 street fighter something and like uh eight games total that's pretty cool so yeah you've
[6667.96 → 6671.06] got to try so what do you think is going to be like a service like a paper monster oh it'll definitely
[6671.06 → 6675.62] be a service NVIDIA doesn't want to run the service they just want to do a proof of concept here
[6675.62 → 6681.06] so that someone else can go and buy a bunch of grid servers and make this a business that makes
[6681.06 → 6687.10] sense, and it'll happen because holy crap it works on live on life yeah it's got to be all over that so
[6687.10 → 6693.18] it'll work okay and then last thing that I'm really excited about here is uh wait oh crap what was it
[6693.86 → 6699.20] it was that my favourite thing while you look for that is the mapping thing because i can map
[6699.20 → 6703.34] things out, but it's going to take me forever to find like my most preferred thing and I would like
[6703.34 → 6707.80] someone who's going to spend a huge amount of time on mapping something like this to just go map it for
[6707.80 → 6712.78] me and then I can just get used to their mapping because I know there's a ton of games where it
[6712.78 → 6717.52] might be mapped differently than I'm wanting what I'm used to but as long as it's still mapped well i
[6717.52 → 6723.14] can get used to it, and it'll be okay like shooters I'll notice shooters like any minor change I notice it
[6723.14 → 6728.00] immediately but as long as it kind of makes sense I can usually get used to it like the control to c
[6728.00 → 6733.28] thing for crouch um a lot of shooters changed crouch to c and I'm used to playing with it
[6733.28 → 6737.36] on control but I got used to that pretty quick because it kind of makes sense like if it's
[6737.36 → 6742.84] after playing with it for a while you understand why they did it I still usually still kind of like
[6742.84 → 6748.56] it on control but either way I forget you find it by now it's not it's not in here it was something
[6748.56 → 6753.60] that I was thinking about okay that i really wanted to say that was on the subject of uh of
[6753.60 → 6759.22] shield and grid and cloud gaming and all that as well uh anyway it works surprisingly well, and it's
[6759.22 → 6767.30] really oh yes limelight so that um that sort of ghetto shield uh just it's an APK you can
[6767.30 → 6773.54] download it was uh there's a thread on DA developers I tried it uh so I tried it on the nexus 5 which is
[6773.54 → 6779.60] pretty much the recommended device so it's got ac wireless um as long as you're running dual-band
[6779.60 → 6783.78] wireless you should be able to leverage that I have an ac router at home so I gave it as much
[6783.78 → 6788.60] wireless bandwidth as I could, I sat next to my router, and it's got so it's got ac wireless and
[6788.60 → 6794.38] it has a Qualcomm snapdragon processor it's got a snapdragon 800 or whatever it is, and it's got
[6794.38 → 6800.00] built-in h264 decode so what that means is that is the optimal most recommended device for limelight
[6800.00 → 6807.48] the experience wasn't very good image quality was fine, but there were very noticeable lag spikes so
[6807.48 → 6812.46] while the game stream works it only works with steam right now so this is very much like a
[6812.46 → 6819.42] a kludge hacked solution it's really cool that it works at all, but it wasn't playable NVIDIA has
[6819.42 → 6825.14] spent a lot of time and done a lot of work optimizing shield in order to deliver the latency that they do
[6825.14 → 6830.64] I'm still considering once limelight gets a couple more releases because it's getting new releases like
[6830.64 → 6836.12] weekly right now um so once we get a couple more releases, and it gets a bit more optimized
[6836.12 → 6842.28] then I think what we should do is we should revisit ghetto shield, and we should go okay you know nexus 5
[6842.28 → 6850.64] or htc1 or some kind of optimal phone on a yoga okay, and then we go that on ac wireless versus shield
[6850.64 → 6857.38] on dual-band n, and then we go uh splash top, and we compare all three with the high speed camera so we
[6857.38 → 6862.08] can really see the difference, and we can see how much optimization work actually goes into making this
[6862.08 → 6867.82] work aside from just the hardware because talking to NVIDIA they claim that it's actually mostly software
[6867.82 → 6874.30] yeah the hardware is nothing special it's a dual-band n antenna and a Terra chip it makes sense
[6874.30 → 6878.30] which is an arm processor with a GeForce core on it, you have to deal with things in a very weird way
[6878.30 → 6884.56] it makes sense that it would be software so right now at least there yeah talked about I talked about
[6884.56 → 6890.40] all the new all the new shield stuff that makes me super excited do you want to do maybe build logs
[6890.40 → 6893.36] and then a twitter thing and then be done or twitter thing and then build logs and be done let's do the
[6893.36 → 6896.82] twitter blitz because I asked you guys to blitz about that a while ago then we'll follow up with
[6896.82 → 6901.94] build logs of the week, and we'll call it a show sure like yeah we'll just like we'll do some things
[6901.94 → 6906.88] and we'll call it a show I hope you guys have enjoyed the better audio quality for this show we have a
[6906.88 → 6910.98] totally new setup actually maybe we'll do a short after party after build logs of the week and I can
[6910.98 → 6919.44] show you guys our new setup because it's really cool all right so um oh tech fanatic you and your long
[6919.44 → 6925.30] pm's on the forum suddenly the end of FX becomes almost irrelevant oh first one first okay the
[6925.30 → 6933.70] point of Twitter is that it's a 140-character limit because that's all we want if you want to type
[6933.70 → 6938.58] essays you can type them to me somewhere else um if HSA and mantle can allow games to leverage the
[6938.58 → 6943.10] IGP of the Apus for physics and hybrid crossfire then all of a sudden the end of FX comes irrelevant
[6943.10 → 6949.38] yeah yeah anything that allows us to utilize the onboard graphics on the CPU more is definitely good
[6949.38 → 6954.74] um Luke is right we have actual numbers for mantle, but we did not see g-sync because we can't and
[6954.74 → 6959.56] it's still only on TN we have actual theoretical numbers for mantle, and we have some preliminary
[6959.56 → 6965.18] numbers for mantle we don't know how mantle affects the actual output quality of the game that's
[6965.18 → 6969.92] something we don't know, yet it probably will be fine it will probably be the same, but it might not
[6969.92 → 6975.12] to I guess fight against myself there it's coming on IPS we just haven't seen it on IPS yet
[6975.12 → 6981.42] yeah and why do you sent me a pm about this dude oh g-sync only works on these no it's
[6981.42 → 6987.58] you're wrong you're just wrong you're wrong g-sync works on any monitor where the monitor manufacturer
[6987.58 → 6996.60] decides to implement the module that's it so yes the launching monitor the prototype that's out now is
[6996.60 → 7003.02] Asus 144 hertz TN okay not particularly exceptional when it comes to viewing angle or colour reproduction
[7003.02 → 7009.06] yes we all know this, but there's no reason that g-sync couldn't be delivered on your next generation 4k TV
[7009.06 → 7016.02] stoked for like which would be amazing that l24 inch 4k quality monitor with g-sync on boom and like
[7016.02 → 7021.32] looking at the Assassin's Creed 5 demo that they had um where NVIDIA was showing off yeah we have
[7021.32 → 7026.86] a 4k gaming now it looked like ass because it was tearing all over the place and like just the
[7026.86 → 7032.02] latency on it was terrible because TVs are stupid, and they have like tremendous input lag
[7032.02 → 7038.66] because remember g-sync is not only this technology it's also a processor yes Gayle again but then
[7038.66 → 7043.42] lower input lag I'm not going to get into all going to be good things um I'm stoked I haven't even seen it
[7043.42 → 7047.42] yet um I'll bring it in on Monday cool so I'm gonna play with it this weekend I'll bring it in on
[7047.42 → 7053.84] Monday, and you will be a believer no I already am because of how but I'm anyway to not get into
[7053.84 → 7058.80] this uh what do you think of republic of gamers GTX 780 Poseidon I think it's a card that has hybrid
[7058.80 → 7065.04] air and liquid cooling I think it's a GTX 780 based graphics card and I think it's going to look like an
[7065.04 → 7069.20] rogue card I don't really know what else you want me to say about if it's going to be jacked of all
[7069.20 → 7073.58] trades master of none we've seen this kind of thing in the past um cooler mat I think it was yeah
[7073.58 → 7078.72] cooler master of all people had what was called the hydra 8800 which was an air cooler slash liquid
[7078.72 → 7084.10] cooler for the 8800 GTX guys go check it out Poseidon is a much more elegant solution than that
[7084.10 → 7088.52] but it's not like this is the first time it's been done something like I racing is no different from
[7088.52 → 7093.78] gt6 pay membership and then pay extra for more tracks and cars we've seen this in other games it's
[7093.78 → 7099.30] just 140 is a lot though yeah remember that having thingies travelling through the air involves 3d
[7099.30 → 7105.70] routes instead of 2d that is a lot more routes uh it's a lot more routes, but it's also a lot more
[7105.70 → 7112.78] um devastating if something goes wrong I guess would be my would be my feedback didn't you buy
[7112.78 → 7117.72] ships and star citizen for more than that car yes but I also got the game and I also got insurance for
[7117.72 → 7123.00] my ships and I also got the ability to be super badass right out of the gate many other things in the
[7123.00 → 7128.48] game and that was supporting we both backed when it was kickstarter yes neither of us backed when it was
[7128.48 → 7133.10] after kickstarter I haven't bought any additional ships and at least when I backed it I think when
[7133.10 → 7137.16] you backed it too it wasn't even 100 funded we hadn't hit a bunch of the milestones that i really
[7137.16 → 7144.56] wanted to see hit like I believe in the project I want it to happen yeah I'm not supporting gt6 to
[7144.56 → 7150.78] I got my backing before it was at 100 like it wasn't even going to be a game, yet bedsheets are invisible
[7150.78 → 7157.92] to sonar and echolocation, so there's a very good point um with respect to navigation so you could catch
[7157.92 → 7164.28] drones make nets yeah drone nets wow drone net even sounds like a thing okay we should like TM
[7164.28 → 7169.76] that drone net TM yeah drone net we'll take 10 royalty yeah 10 royalty I bet drones will have
[7169.76 → 7173.94] night vision type eyes okay well you're increasing the cost significantly again because remember the
[7173.94 → 7180.78] way night vision works is just like yet wouldn't there are different kinds of big problem actually
[7180.78 → 7186.14] with night vision because it's particles there are different ways that night vision works and i I think
[7186.14 → 7189.72] depending on which one it may or may not be I don't know enough about night vision to really
[7189.72 → 7196.58] talk about it, I don't know much at all so yeah um everyone will work at research facilities maybe a
[7196.58 → 7201.04] few engineers or repair guys yeah but not every this is something that I think people need to come to
[7201.04 → 7208.40] terms with not everyone is cut out to be an engineer and that's life um not everyone is cut out to be
[7208.40 → 7213.54] the news anchor on their favourite news show you know you can look at the guy or the girl who's doing
[7213.54 → 7217.02] that and be like oh i you know I wish I could do that there will probably still be stuff for people
[7217.02 → 7220.90] I don't know, but there's like there's one spot for that person and unfortunately that's
[7222.42 → 7228.64] that one person can get it and so if we eliminate all the jobs for the people who
[7228.64 → 7236.68] aren't engineers unless we support them in some other way then that and then the engineers are all
[7236.68 → 7240.94] upset because well we're just supporting those guys and their layabouts and okay, but there will
[7240.94 → 7244.58] probably be I think there will probably be more jobs and I think different markets will blow up a
[7244.58 → 7250.26] little bit more and i think might change I don't know uh Harrison says I'm looking at video card for
[7250.26 → 7255.32] my friend post it on the forum man uh you need maintenance for 54 000 drones there will be jobs made
[7255.32 → 7260.04] you need people flying them too I know they fly on their own yeah and the maintenance uh if you had
[7260.04 → 7268.74] 54 000 of exactly the same thing it's probably worthwhile to invest in a machine that 3d scans and then 3d
[7268.74 → 7273.46] prints the replacement parts and then puts them back together so yeah
[7273.46 → 7282.44] yeah yeah yeah people still have to develop the software for that machine and build that machine
[7282.44 → 7289.82] and design that machine and all that kind of stuff but um the show is called wan show weekly analysis and
[7289.82 → 7296.46] news doesn't say computer in there we focus on technology stuff I mean and those drones are
[7296.46 → 7301.52] technology yeah they're totally technology Linus tech tips what confuses me most reviewers say that
[7301.52 → 7305.00] AMD and intel are both equally good but most use intel in their systems why
[7305.00 → 7309.46] that's that's yeah scroll
[7309.46 → 7316.26] apple high watch okay and the reason I'm avoiding that question has nothing to do with intel paying
[7316.26 → 7320.60] reviewers or anything like that AMD throws money at reviewers too they both do don't imagine that
[7320.60 → 7330.80] doesn't happen um we use what we are okay that's we talk about the merits of AMD technology a lot
[7330.80 → 7338.40] but mostly we focus on what's great about it for the value conscious consumer when you're not paying
[7338.40 → 7342.92] for hardware you don't have to be value conscious you're not value conscious why do I run an extreme
[7342.92 → 7347.84] edition not because it makes any sense I wouldn't buy an extreme edition ridiculous every single
[7347.84 → 7352.10] time I've seen the extreme edition recommended to anyone I've always tried to step in and be like
[7352.10 → 7359.52] whoa wait hold on a minute there might be a better option for you so it's not it's not about
[7359.52 → 7366.02] what makes sense for an average consumer it's about if you have this CPU that you got for free and
[7366.02 → 7369.74] this one that you got for free then you might as well use whichever one is just outright better
[7369.74 → 7377.12] it doesn't matter if it costs more 8350 versus the 3960x oh apple I watch rumours okay I don't
[7377.12 → 7381.20] click on links during the show but I'll definitely check that out with NVIDIA's Terra mobile chips
[7381.20 → 7386.54] going from strength to strength do you think we'll ever see a desktop grade NVIDIA CPU no I don't think
[7386.54 → 7392.38] so because they can't get an x86 license and x86 isn't going anywhere anytime soon I think uh
[7392.38 → 7398.12] windows RT is all the proof we need of that and uh their mobile chips are going from strength to
[7398.12 → 7403.62] strength, but they don't have a lot of design wins with Terra 4 it's in shield and like their
[7403.62 → 7410.98] own tablet so far so I mean I think it's great technology I think it's a great product i just
[7410.98 → 7418.60] I'm not sure what its place is in the marketplace in the long term uh guys unknown is a Pokémon oh okay
[7418.60 → 7425.68] sure Linus is right we have actual numbers for mantle but did not cannot CG sync oh wow i I don't care
[7425.68 → 7432.80] that you can't see g sync I've seen it, and it's good uh AMD is dropping the FX lineup is CP upgrade
[7432.80 → 7438.46] ability of my am3 plus mobile dead yeah pretty much you guys are bickering yeah we sometimes do
[7438.46 → 7445.16] we try not to do it on camera for the most part, but sometimes he's just so that it needs to be uh
[7445.16 → 7451.44] he needs to be put in his place we need eight core Apus yeah I agree people cannot comprehend g sync
[7451.44 → 7454.96] because they haven't seen it, but people do not know what met with mantle because it's not out yet
[7454.96 → 7460.44] yes James Taylor I agree with you, they can't comprehend that doesn't mean its unknown oh my god
[7460.44 → 7466.94] Linus I agree with you over you here over slick ah Justin you're my man what if GPU and CPU could be
[7466.94 → 7471.24] used for combined equal power instead of having to find tasks that's absolutely what's coming HSA is
[7471.24 → 7477.86] coming yeah that's the point all right should I buy a 780 try save money and get a r9 290 water cool it
[7477.86 → 7483.60] we haven't done that test yet would that be saving money no maybe about the same yeah actually yeah
[7483.60 → 7489.62] and then that assumes you already own a custom liquid cooling setup for your CPU or something
[7489.62 → 7493.60] and you can integrate it unless you buy a g10 and assumes you don't need to add another radiator
[7493.60 → 7499.44] to account for the extra heat load unless you buy a g10 unless you buy a g10, but that assumes you have
[7499.44 → 7507.60] an old Asiatic unit kicking around, but then that's still cheaper oh then like a block probably
[7507.60 → 7511.42] a g10 and an Asiatic unit yeah that's probably about right yeah yeah I think you're right
[7511.42 → 7518.70] oh whoa that was fun that went away really quickly okay back to twitter I agree about the benefits of
[7518.70 → 7523.16] one socket it'll create more motherboard choices yep absolutely tech fanatic dude
[7523.16 → 7528.08] I'm still interested in what he has to say I'm interested in what he has to say, but he's like
[7528.08 → 7533.52] got as many tweets as everyone else combined I'm very happy with my a350 I think that it'll be enough
[7533.52 → 7538.30] for another five years I think five years might be optimistic I mean we go back and look at what CPUs
[7538.30 → 7547.12] we were running five years ago that was like LGA 775 the core 2 quad q6600 has not aged particularly
[7547.12 → 7554.82] well so doing all right but yeah mine's still working pretty good yeah it works you can play
[7554.82 → 7562.92] bf3 on it okay like no problem at all okay didn't we run that and didn't it not run particularly well
[7562.92 → 7570.64] I thought we tested that no oh no we had an e6600 oh okay all right well I don't know about the I'm not
[7570.64 → 7574.86] I'm not defending the five years thing I'm just I think I'm pretty much done with that for now why
[7574.86 → 7579.52] don't you do your uh build logs of the week thing where is if it's in it's on the is that you
[7579.52 → 7588.58] right there this week oh okay hooray Linus's screen lets all share it so Linus can show us all the
[7588.58 → 7593.12] things whatever problem we had with uh frames getting dropped earlier on in the show is totally
[7593.12 → 7598.72] gone that's kind of cool yeah yeah I thought maybe we had a long-term problem there I'm going to let you
[7598.72 → 7603.34] I'm going to let you ponder oh wait you have to download it first oh you are never mind gotcha
[7603.34 → 7606.86] um you might want to take a little pre-shot try and figure out what's going on there
[7606.86 → 7613.12] that's awesome that's like super classic wow I love it
[7613.86 → 7621.44] huh, so this is a really cool build log there 's's yeah they're both they're both really cool
[7621.44 → 7626.26] all right slideshow as normal they're both so guys just a reminder these are build logs from the
[7626.26 → 7630.84] Linus tech tips' forum build log section you can definitely check them out there and you
[7630.84 → 7636.72] definitely should because it is basically impossible for us to cover everything and show everything I'm
[7636.72 → 7642.50] just going to hide us right now so we're just showing like uh ideas and stuff oh my goodness this is so
[7642.50 → 7647.78] cool, so there's a couple of i can't remember I can't remember if this is p182 white edition I guess
[7647.78 → 7653.50] it would be can't remember exactly what case that is, but they've got one of them upside down and one of
[7653.50 → 7657.88] them right side up and then whatever the heck's going on up here with handles
[7657.88 → 7665.32] unreal so okay you know what you better walk through this you can tell the mid has been gutted
[7665.32 → 7671.24] yeah so you can see between the two cases is completely open now yeah so a lot of what
[7671.24 → 7677.48] we're showing here is going to be like some pretty close-up you can't, you need to go look at the bill
[7677.48 → 7683.20] god guide build log sorry build log um because there are a lot of shots that we didn't include
[7683.20 → 7688.10] we included way too many shots of this computer, but we still can't show everything that's like
[7688.10 → 7693.16] important look at these I love these fittings which ones are these are the um are those
[7693.16 → 7697.60] the monsoons I think they are I didn't actually look at the name in the build going, but they look
[7697.60 → 7702.64] like monsoons those are beautiful they remind me of monsoons I'm not entirely sure if they might not
[7702.64 → 7707.36] be they might be a different one that i had seen before either way they're absolutely beautiful
[7707.36 → 7710.70] I didn't look up the name in the bill match the tubing really nicely normally I wouldn't really
[7710.70 → 7716.60] like orange tubing or orange fluid, but it actually really works really well
[7716.60 → 7720.84] and he has a fascinating scheme for his uh guild management colour look at these look at
[7720.84 → 7725.80] these graphics cards so he's got he's turned he's turned it into a cube case which is absolutely
[7725.80 → 7730.76] amazing and I love the lighting coming out through the front here as well yeah what a fantastic
[7730.76 → 7734.64] gaming rig chopping that middle through and make it go all the way through the back is just super
[7734.64 → 7740.88] cool really really really cool midnight smurf water cooled 650d I can already tell this is going to be
[7740.88 → 7746.66] beautiful I like the carbon fibre in very small print yet another water cooled 650d
[7746.66 → 7752.08] so the first picture you go to that shows just awesome sleeving, and then you start to see like
[7752.08 → 7758.70] just carbon fibre on the things and stuff everywhere they're on the block doesn't shy away from
[7758.70 → 7765.10] right on the SSD love that yeah doesn't shy away from too many cables um fills his freaking case like
[7765.10 → 7769.38] he's got a ton of stuff in here which is really cool actually because I notice a lot of people that
[7769.38 → 7774.98] do build logs they'll be like yeah my super awesome rig that has one card, and you can't see any drives
[7774.98 → 7779.42] and there's nothing in here yeah well to be clear a rig can be super awesome and have one card oh
[7779.42 → 7784.16] definitely we're not down on that what we're down on is people being like wow look how great my cable
[7784.16 → 7789.92] management is when they have like one card and one drive yeah whereas like my system people might
[7789.92 → 7795.62] knock my cable management particularly at the back but I have a sound card that needs power I have a
[7795.62 → 7803.50] raid card that has like SFF 80 87 connectors that go out to like quad SATA breakout cables I have my
[7803.50 → 7809.08] graphics card that needs two eight pin no I'm down to an eight pin and a six pin so I had to hide the
[7809.08 → 7814.68] two pins I'm like jammed behind them that's even more ridiculous like full water cooling with two
[7814.68 → 7818.58] rads I think is whatever I have so like it gets a lot more difficult the more crap and like lighting
[7818.58 → 7824.08] all over the place becomes a lot more difficult to wire as well so I wasn't I wasn't knocking on
[7824.08 → 7829.08] people that don't have a lot of stuff in their case I was just saying a lot of people try and brag
[7829.08 → 7834.10] about the cable management yeah can be easier which is like yeah and that's cool, and you did a
[7834.10 → 7838.50] perfect job but like this is when I'm really impressed it's like holy crap this guy put all the
[7838.50 → 7843.68] things in his case and like his runs are spotless nice arcs all over the place and the sleeving
[7843.68 → 7848.30] is awesome it just looks really, really good you know what I just realized so uh that's the end of
