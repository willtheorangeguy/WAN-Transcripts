[0.80 --> 6.20]  Welcome to the WAN Show, guys. It's August 16th, which is actually almost my birthday.
[6.20 --> 10.20]  I know you give zero cares about birthdays and you had no idea that was coming, but...
[10.20 --> 12.00]  You know what? I actually did.
[12.00 --> 13.00]  Did you?
[13.00 --> 16.00]  Because the last time it was your birthday, I put it in my phone.
[16.00 --> 20.72]  Oh, good work. Okay. Well, it's my birthday and my cat decided to help me celebrate by
[20.72 --> 26.00]  peeing on my motorcycle jacket. So if you had detected the smell of cat urine about me,
[26.00 --> 27.00]  then...
[27.00 --> 28.00]  No, actually.
[28.00 --> 31.00]  That is where it was coming from, not from this vulgar shirt.
[31.00 --> 33.00]  That would have been equally plausible.
[33.00 --> 39.00]  Yeah, yeah. So this shirt is my special treat for all the viewers there today who wanted
[39.00 --> 44.00]  to see me wearing this kind of a shirt. It's absolutely horrible. It's for an upcoming video
[44.00 --> 49.00]  where my character is just sort of a horrible person in general. But anyway, we've got some
[49.00 --> 53.00]  great topics for the WAN Show. There's a new Witcher 3 trailer, which we're going to be
[53.00 --> 58.00]  definitely talking about. We've also got some exciting stuff. There's a ton of room
[58.00 --> 64.00]  about AMD's upcoming graphics cards. So we'll be shooting the breeze about that. Our special
[64.00 --> 69.00]  guest... Remember, guys, our special guests are powered by Razercoms. So check out the...
[69.00 --> 73.00]  Oh, yeah. It's a little bit higher than usual. There's a lot of headroom here. Our special guests
[73.00 --> 79.00]  are powered by Razercoms. You can download it here. It helps us out a great deal. It's a voice chat client
[79.00 --> 85.00]  optimized for gaming as opposed to for talking with your mother who lives in another country like Skype.
[85.00 --> 91.00]  So things like the game overlays or the overlays won't kill you and disrupt your gameplay, all that kind of good stuff.
[91.00 --> 95.00]  It's free. It's beta. Definitely.
[95.00 --> 102.00]  Can't emphasize that enough. A lot of people have been saying, oh, Razercoms isn't perfect. Yes, we know. It's not perfect. Razer knows. That's why it's called beta.
[102.00 --> 107.00]  I hope it's not perpetually beta, like Gmail. Do you remember how long Gmail was beta?
[107.00 --> 117.00]  And Minecraft. Yeah. Although they both worked... Like, Minecraft felt like a fully finished game. I think he was just like, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to.
[117.00 --> 127.00]  Right. Okay, but this is legitimately beta. So they're issuing patches like every few days. Anyway, guys, definitely try it out. Try it out with your gaming group. Use the Bitly link here. It helps us out a whole heck of a lot.
[127.00 --> 139.00]  So our special guest this week is Ryan Shrout from PC Perspective. So we're going to be talking to him about AMD's new frame pacing driver as well as maybe, you know, shooting the breeze about some of the rumors.
[139.00 --> 148.00]  It's always kind of iffy how much the media folks can say and can't say because once they actually hear something officially, then it's kind of hard to talk about it.
[148.00 --> 154.00]  Whereas if they're not the source and, you know, they don't know anything about it anyway, then it's a little bit easier there.
[154.00 --> 162.00]  So without further ado, intro time. Where's the intro? You have got to be kidding me.
[162.00 --> 166.00]  It's the exact same thing as last week. Yes, it is the exact same thing as last week.
[166.00 --> 178.00]  You would think that I would somehow predict that, but that is actually not what happens sometimes when these things do occur in such a way that...
[178.00 --> 184.00]  Keep going. I'm stalling for time, which should be obvious at this point.
[184.00 --> 186.00]  Was that it? But I think that this is it.
[186.00 --> 188.00]  This is it.
[188.00 --> 202.00]  So guys, we've also got a new sponsor this week.
[202.00 --> 218.00]  This episode of The WAN Show is brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[218.00 --> 225.00]  Squarespace is the easy way to create a beautiful, functional website for your organization, blog, online store, or more.
[225.00 --> 229.00]  Visit Squarespace.com to get a free, fully functional trial without a credit card.
[229.00 --> 234.00]  And use offer code Linus8 to get 10% off your purchase for new accounts.
[234.00 --> 237.00]  So there you have it, guys. We are finally kicked off.
[237.00 --> 240.00]  So why don't we dive right into maybe one quick topic here.
[240.00 --> 252.00]  And then we're going to ask Ryan to join us because he is in the Eastern Time Zone and has very kindly asked to join us at the earliest possible opportunity so that he can sleep.
[252.00 --> 253.00]  That's kind of important.
[253.00 --> 258.00]  Yeah, I'm going to take a shot at him for that once he gets on here because real nerds don't need sleep.
[258.00 --> 261.00]  So I think we all know that that's true.
[261.00 --> 263.00]  So what do we got as our opening kickoff here?
[263.00 --> 267.00]  Might as well jump right into the top one, which is EA Humble Bundle.
[267.00 --> 269.00]  EA Humble Bundle, yes indeed.
[269.00 --> 275.00]  So for those of you who haven't heard, I'm just going to go ahead and open this up on the old laptop here.
[275.00 --> 277.00]  Boom, there it is.
[277.00 --> 280.00]  The Humble Origin Bundle.
[280.00 --> 282.00]  Eight games.
[282.00 --> 288.00]  And I think the average price last time I looked was around $4, which is outstanding.
[288.00 --> 292.00]  Where is it? $4.80, so it's actually going up.
[292.00 --> 296.00]  Now EA has outdone themselves here, which isn't hard.
[296.00 --> 298.00]  Boom, boom, tshh.
[298.00 --> 299.00]  Oof.
[299.00 --> 300.00]  Still taking shots.
[300.00 --> 317.00]  EA has outdone themselves here because normally the way Humble Bundle works is it's up to the person buying the bundle to decide how much money to allocate to the developer and then how much to allocate to Humble Bundle.
[317.00 --> 318.00]  You know, hey, thanks for doing this.
[318.00 --> 319.00]  And a charity.
[319.00 --> 320.00]  And a charity.
[320.00 --> 321.00]  There's usually at least one charity tied in.
[321.00 --> 324.00]  EA has taken out the developer.
[324.00 --> 327.00]  They probably knew no one was going to give them any money.
[327.00 --> 329.00]  Boom, tshh.
[329.00 --> 331.00]  Oh, I'm sorry, EA.
[331.00 --> 333.00]  You guys are actually kind of awesome this time.
[333.00 --> 349.00]  So you've got the option to give some money to Humble Bundle and then you have your choice of five outstanding charities including Human Rights Campaign, WOTC, San Francisco AIDS Foundation, American Cancer Society, and American Red Cross.
[349.00 --> 358.00]  And you can allocate however much of the money you're paying to whoever you want in whatever proportion you want, which is just a really cool thing to do.
[358.00 --> 367.00]  They have sold over 1.1 million bundles and raised over 5.5 million dollars for charity.
[367.00 --> 371.00]  And people that are crying about Origin because it's the Humble Bundle, Origin Bundle.
[371.00 --> 372.00]  Yes.
[372.00 --> 375.00]  I think it's like 5 out of the 8 games come with Steam codes.
[375.00 --> 376.00]  Yes.
[376.00 --> 377.00]  So you, they're, look at this.
[377.00 --> 382.00]  EA actually, I'm not even going to, you know, ptum, shoot this because it's not fair.
[382.00 --> 385.00]  They have gone the extra mile here.
[385.00 --> 387.00]  Most of the games are available on Steam.
[387.00 --> 391.00]  We usually wreck them, but give credit where credit's due.
[391.00 --> 392.00]  This is pretty freaking awesome.
[392.00 --> 393.00]  Yeah.
[393.00 --> 403.00]  And you know, it's funny, we had some comments on our forum, hey guys, EA must have been watching your last live stream because you burned them for only contributing, I think it was $16,000 or something.
[403.00 --> 404.00]  Somewhere around there.
[404.00 --> 405.00]  You know what?
[405.00 --> 408.00]  They're giving away their games for charity this week.
[408.00 --> 411.00]  They're raising millions of dollars, so...
[411.00 --> 412.00]  That's the way to do it.
[412.00 --> 413.00]  Good job.
[413.00 --> 414.00]  There we go.
[414.00 --> 417.00]  The first time we've ever applauded EA on this show.
[417.00 --> 418.00]  Seriously.
[418.00 --> 421.00]  Well, but like, yeah, we've applauded them like ironically.
[421.00 --> 422.00]  But not seriously.
[422.00 --> 423.00]  This is serious, serious applaud.
[423.00 --> 424.00]  Yeah.
[424.00 --> 425.00]  Good job, EA.
[425.00 --> 429.00]  There's been some problems with activating origin codes and stuff like that, but they are...
[429.00 --> 430.00]  I was saving that for like the punchline.
[430.00 --> 431.00]  Were you?
[431.00 --> 432.00]  Oh, sorry.
[432.00 --> 433.00]  Yeah.
[433.00 --> 435.00]  So Sims 3, there's been some issues.
[435.00 --> 437.00]  People haven't been able to activate it.
[437.00 --> 444.00]  There doesn't seem to be a clear answer whether it's related to region or Windows 8 or EA's
[444.00 --> 449.00]  pointing the finger back at Humble Bundle about why it's not working and then Humble Bundle's
[449.00 --> 454.00]  saying that they might be region specific, but then some people outside of the US are activating
[454.00 --> 456.00]  them, so I don't know what's going on at all.
[456.00 --> 460.00]  They are claiming to be working on it and five of the games come with Steam codes anyways.
[460.00 --> 461.00]  Yeah.
[461.00 --> 462.00]  So we'll give them that.
[462.00 --> 466.00]  Anyway, you guys, so the games that you get are Dead Space, Burnout Paradise, The Ultimate
[466.00 --> 471.00]  Box, Crisis 2 Maximum Edition, Mirror's Edge, Dead Space 3, Medal of Honor, and if you
[471.00 --> 476.00]  pay more than the average price, you get Battlefield 3, The Sims 3, plus the starter
[476.00 --> 479.00]  pack, which I believe is two extra content packs.
[479.00 --> 480.00]  Okay.
[480.00 --> 481.00]  So absolutely outstanding.
[481.00 --> 489.00]  Without further ado, I would like to invite Mr. Ryan Shrout from PC Perspective to join
[489.00 --> 491.00]  us here on the WAN Show.
[491.00 --> 492.00]  So we're making our call.
[492.00 --> 494.00]  Remember guys, guests are powered by Razer comms.
[494.00 --> 497.00]  And let's add our guest lower third.
[497.00 --> 503.00]  Ryan gave us a fantastic number of options to choose from.
[503.00 --> 504.00]  Oh, hold on.
[504.00 --> 507.00]  I wonder if that's a thing.
[507.00 --> 508.00]  That happened before.
[508.00 --> 509.00]  There we go.
[509.00 --> 511.00]  Let's try making our call here.
[511.00 --> 512.00]  Hmm?
[512.00 --> 513.00]  Restart it now.
[513.00 --> 514.00]  Okay.
[514.00 --> 515.00]  We're going to restart this really quick.
[515.00 --> 517.00]  We're also going to add our guest's lower third.
[517.00 --> 519.00]  So we have a special lower third for our guests now.
[519.00 --> 525.00]  Ryan gave us a fantastic choice of different options for us to use for his lower third.
[525.00 --> 528.00]  He sent us two pictures, both of which were this one.
[528.00 --> 530.00]  So that was a bit interesting.
[530.00 --> 536.00]  So speaking of the beta status of Razer comms, we're going to go ahead and delete system 32,
[536.00 --> 545.00]  which is one of the helpful tips that was given to us here on Twitter to help us diagnose any kinds of system issues that we might be having.
[545.00 --> 546.00]  There you go.
[546.00 --> 552.00]  Thank you, Christian Molay for giving us that great little tip there.
[552.00 --> 554.00]  You are truly a gentleman and a scholar.
[557.00 --> 558.00]  Ryan, are you there?
[558.00 --> 559.00]  Yeah, there you are.
[559.00 --> 560.00]  All right.
[560.00 --> 561.00]  So how's it going?
[561.00 --> 564.00]  How's the PC reviewing biz?
[564.00 --> 565.00]  It goes.
[565.00 --> 566.00]  It continues.
[566.00 --> 569.00]  It's a never-ending process, as you're aware.
[569.00 --> 579.00]  Some weeks more exciting than others, but I have a feeling that the rest of the year will be as exciting as the early part of the summer was.
[579.00 --> 588.00]  Well, that is a very, very helpful clue for the viewers, I think, if they know what was going on in the early part of the summer.
[588.00 --> 594.00]  And it's funny that you should mention that because I remember AMD saying something along the lines of,
[594.00 --> 599.00]  we are not releasing a new GPU architecture this year.
[600.00 --> 601.00]  And then...
[601.00 --> 603.00]  Yeah, they said that, didn't they?
[603.00 --> 604.00]  They sure did.
[604.00 --> 605.00]  They did say that.
[605.00 --> 606.00]  They did say that.
[606.00 --> 615.00]  You know, I think what they actually said at that point was that there were rumors that a new GPU was coming very soon,
[615.00 --> 620.00]  and they said, ah, our product lineup is going to be stable through 2013.
[620.00 --> 625.00]  And you can PR speak that in kind of any way you want, right?
[625.00 --> 632.00]  And then they kind of had a call and said, well, I think at the end of the call they did kind of admit that there would be something before the end of the year.
[632.00 --> 633.00]  Obviously...
[633.00 --> 635.00]  But they were very wishy-washy about it.
[635.00 --> 643.00]  And after they made the statement about stable throughout the year, how many weeks was it or how many days was it before they released 7790,
[643.00 --> 649.00]  which was actually not quite based on the same design as the previous GPUs.
[649.00 --> 650.00]  Right.
[650.00 --> 651.00]  Yeah.
[651.00 --> 652.00]  I mean, you're right.
[652.00 --> 653.00]  It wasn't that long.
[653.00 --> 659.00]  And it's an interesting web they weave, right?
[659.00 --> 660.00]  All these companies kind of do that.
[660.00 --> 671.00]  And I think they were afraid of people assuming that, you know, they were going to release new GPUs in June or July and thus kind of killing any possible sales in the March, April, May timeframe.
[671.00 --> 678.00]  You know, that's always what you got to, with any release of hardware or gadgets or whatever, you don't want people to know about the new one too early.
[678.00 --> 683.00]  Otherwise they won't want to buy the old one that you have warehouses and warehouses of.
[683.00 --> 688.00]  Which is funny because so many different companies take such different approaches to this.
[688.00 --> 700.00]  You look at Intel where their roadmaps are, I mean, even general consumers reading reviews on PC Perspective or other hardware sites are going to know what's coming for the next couple years.
[700.00 --> 701.00]  Yeah.
[701.00 --> 710.00]  And then Nvidia and AMD, like they hold their cards like close to their chest to the point where, is there a purpose?
[710.00 --> 715.00]  Well, so Intel has that capability because they're such a dominant player in the market, right?
[715.00 --> 725.00]  So they don't really have any real big competition from AMD in mobile or desktop or, you know, all in one PCs and that kind of thing.
[725.00 --> 731.00]  So when they give out their roadmap, they can change it kind of however they want and they're not going to be affected.
[731.00 --> 733.00]  They're not going to get dinged in the market.
[733.00 --> 742.00]  They're not going to get, you know, dinged by, well, they might get dinged by enthusiasts, but it's not really going to matter because the blip we make on their sales radar is relatively small.
[742.00 --> 749.00]  So because they don't have any real strong competition, they don't worry if AMD knows what they have planned.
[749.00 --> 754.00]  Whereas AMD and Nvidia on the graphics side definitely worry about what the other one has planned.
[754.00 --> 765.00]  That is a very good point. You know what? This wasn't on our live stream document, but I want to talk APU because these rumors have been swirling for a long time.
[765.00 --> 775.00]  And there was an article recently that was on a fairly non-credible site. I think it was a PC perspective or something like that. No, I'm just kidding. It was a different site.
[775.00 --> 784.00]  That AMD is going to abandon the high-end desktop CPU market. What do you make of this?
[784.00 --> 797.00]  It wouldn't really surprise me at all because Intel tries to do that every chance they get, right? So Sandy Bridge E has been around for way too long.
[797.00 --> 806.00]  Ivy Bridge E is right around the corner. But Ivy Bridge E and Sandy Bridge E, these kind of high-end workstation processors that enthusiasts buy into are really just that.
[806.00 --> 817.00]  They're server and workstation parts that are kind of being trimmed down. There's, I mean, if you look at Ivy Bridge, if you look at Haswell, those parts really start at like the 350 range and go down.
[817.00 --> 823.00]  There's no real high-end market in those, what I would consider mainstream processors at this point.
[823.00 --> 832.00]  AMD has a big disadvantage in terms of performance, in terms of efficiency. Their bulldozer architecture kind of flopped miserably.
[832.00 --> 839.00]  You know, I'm sure you guys talked about when they released the 220-watt 8-core processor that ran at 5 gigahertz.
[839.00 --> 854.00]  And what kind of a joke that actually is that, you know, it's a $1,000 AMD processor, an $800 AMD processor that runs at two times the thermal limit of an Ivy Bridge or Haswell that it can't really keep up with in terms of performance.
[854.00 --> 864.00]  So, you know, AMD has brought in, actually re-added some of their better engineers, like top-level engineers on the CPU and GPU side.
[864.00 --> 874.12]  So I wouldn't really count them out 100% yet, but it's going to be at least, you know, 18 months, 24 months or beyond before we see a kind of turnaround.
[874.12 --> 876.12]  It takes that long in the micro-architecture world.
[876.12 --> 888.12]  And it's funny you mention that, because we talk about AMD and NVIDIA jealously guarding secrets from each other, even down to things like the day of a particular launch when we're a month away.
[888.12 --> 901.12]  But like you said, adding a new architect to a team or new engineers to a team probably won't affect an actual product until 18 to 24 months down the line.
[901.12 --> 905.12]  So it really raises the question, why do they bother?
[905.12 --> 913.12]  Well, so obviously if they're doing that, then they believe that there is still a market for discrete higher-end processors.
[913.12 --> 918.12]  And I think what we're going to find is more of these overlaps are going to occur with the server and workstation world.
[918.12 --> 921.12]  There's not going to be any kind of dedicated desktop processors.
[921.12 --> 926.12]  I know everybody is afraid about the move of Intel to BGA-only processors.
[926.12 --> 933.12]  And that's kind of an inevitable outcome with these $200 and below processors.
[933.12 --> 936.12]  That's just the way the markets are going to work.
[936.12 --> 938.12]  Well, you look at the way they trim costs on a motherboard.
[938.12 --> 943.12]  Saving $0.32 is actually a thing.
[943.12 --> 948.12]  And if you look at the cost of a socket, if they could stop putting a socket on a board,
[948.12 --> 953.12]  I think both Intel and the motherboard manufacturers would be giving it the old thumbs up.
[953.12 --> 960.12]  Well, I think the motherboard manufacturers will hate it because they are now responsible then for twice the product RMA.
[960.12 --> 967.12]  So if a processor has an issue, they're now responsible for returning that and replacing it and all that kind of stuff.
[967.12 --> 972.12]  It also means they have to have, if they want to even attempt to offer the same amount of choice,
[972.12 --> 975.12]  they're going to have to drastically increase their SKU count.
[975.12 --> 983.12]  So if you get like an ASUS Z87 Pro motherboard, now you want it with the high-end processor, the mid-range processor, the low-end processor.
[983.12 --> 985.12]  I'm going to play devil's advocate here.
[985.12 --> 986.12]  Yep.
[986.12 --> 992.12]  And I'm going to throw this at you because having worked in retail, I've seen a pretty good cross-section of RMA percentages.
[992.12 --> 1001.12]  And CPUs are like one in a thousand, maybe. Motherboards are a whole heck of a lot more than that.
[1001.12 --> 1014.12]  So I would actually argue that the CPU defects rate will affect motherboard RMAs less than end-user error installing CPUs into sockets, which I've seen a lot of.
[1014.12 --> 1017.12]  Yeah. I mean, that's entirely possible, I guess.
[1017.12 --> 1027.12]  Because, well, I know for a fact that motherboard vendors hated it when Intel removed the pens from the processor and put them on the socket themselves.
[1027.12 --> 1028.12]  Yes.
[1028.12 --> 1032.12]  And that was kind of, everybody took it as Intel kind of giving the finger to the board vendors and said,
[1032.12 --> 1035.12]  well, if you still want to play in our ecosystem, you kind of have to do what we want to do.
[1035.12 --> 1040.12]  So I could see that point of view that it would actually lower RMAs on that product as a whole,
[1040.12 --> 1049.12]  but it still would be a kind of pricing and skewing issue that Intel would essentially be shoving off to their board partners.
[1049.12 --> 1054.12]  They'd probably just have to have less skews. Like the ProBoard might come with one or two different options.
[1054.12 --> 1061.12]  And that'll be that. And I think, honestly, it's going to cause more problems for the retailers than it will necessarily for the board makers.
[1061.12 --> 1062.12]  Because you have to stock so much more stuff.
[1062.12 --> 1067.12]  And the product managers are going to have to be so much more educated than they used to be.
[1067.12 --> 1073.12]  You can't just kind of, you know, be a machine ordering every board, ordering every CPU,
[1073.12 --> 1076.12]  and then just kind of watching what customers buy and replenishing as needed.
[1076.12 --> 1081.12]  You'll have to actually make intelligent choices about, and at the product management level,
[1081.12 --> 1087.12]  both at the manufacturer and at the retailer, where they have to decide what the end user will probably want.
[1087.12 --> 1089.12]  Because sometimes it's not that predictable.
[1089.12 --> 1090.12]  Yeah.
[1090.12 --> 1093.12]  Like I'd put together bundles sometimes, sort of on a whim.
[1093.12 --> 1096.12]  Oh, I need to fill up like a fourth bundle spot.
[1096.12 --> 1100.12]  And then that would be the one that would sell and I'd be floored.
[1100.12 --> 1108.12]  Unless it's like Sabretooth Z77 and 3570K. Then you know that'll do well.
[1108.12 --> 1109.12]  Yes.
[1109.12 --> 1113.12]  And I mean, that's another argument for BGA.
[1113.12 --> 1118.12]  Because if you paired a Sabretooth Z87 with a 4670K, I mean, Ryan,
[1118.12 --> 1121.12]  how many people do you think are buying a different CPU with that board?
[1121.12 --> 1123.12]  I honestly don't know.
[1123.12 --> 1125.12]  I would assume it's not that many, right?
[1125.12 --> 1131.12]  So the Intel kind of lineup is fairly modest as it is now,
[1131.12 --> 1136.12]  in terms of what parts DIY guys are actually picking up, I'm sure.
[1136.12 --> 1142.12]  It's just, it's, I think when this happens, you will see people leave the motherboard business
[1142.12 --> 1145.12]  that aren't giant players already.
[1145.12 --> 1148.12]  What do you think about that?
[1148.12 --> 1153.12]  I'm a, I guess this is, it's going to sound bad.
[1153.12 --> 1154.12]  I'm okay with that.
[1154.12 --> 1155.12]  Right.
[1155.12 --> 1158.12]  You know, there are, there are, compare the number of motherboard manufacturers today
[1158.12 --> 1160.12]  to what there were five, 10 years ago.
[1160.12 --> 1161.12]  Let's go 10 years ago.
[1162.12 --> 1163.12]  And.
[1163.12 --> 1164.12]  Soltech.
[1164.12 --> 1165.12]  Soltech for life.
[1165.12 --> 1166.12]  Soltech.
[1166.12 --> 1167.12]  Soyo.
[1168.12 --> 1169.12]  DFI was a big player.
[1169.12 --> 1172.12]  All these guys that used to try to make enthusiast DIY parts.
[1172.12 --> 1174.12]  A lot of them are gone.
[1174.12 --> 1177.12]  And, and we're really kind of left with a handful.
[1177.12 --> 1179.12]  Asus, Gigabyte, MSI.
[1179.12 --> 1183.12]  You know, you've got others like ASRock and EVGA that are still in there,
[1183.12 --> 1185.12]  that are, are doing interesting things.
[1185.12 --> 1188.12]  But it's, it's really down to a couple of main players.
[1188.12 --> 1189.12]  But I wouldn't, it wouldn't surprise me now.
[1189.12 --> 1192.12]  Intel's let, gone essentially from that market.
[1192.12 --> 1194.12]  They're not building boards on their own anymore.
[1194.12 --> 1199.12]  That you would kind of really be left with like, EV or Asus and Gigabyte.
[1199.12 --> 1200.12]  Maybe that's it.
[1200.12 --> 1201.12]  Right.
[1201.12 --> 1202.12]  You know, you just never know.
[1202.12 --> 1203.12]  Fascinating.
[1203.12 --> 1206.12]  So I'd like to take this opportunity for a moment to, uh,
[1206.12 --> 1210.12]  ask you guys to direct some Twitter questions to Ryan.
[1210.12 --> 1213.12]  We're going to do a Twitter blitz with him before he has to leave us.
[1213.12 --> 1217.12]  Again, he apparently has to sleep because he's, he's weak.
[1217.12 --> 1218.12]  Unlike the rest of us nerds.
[1218.12 --> 1219.12]  Yeah.
[1219.12 --> 1221.12]  I heard you, I heard you bashing me earlier for that.
[1221.12 --> 1222.12]  Yes.
[1222.12 --> 1223.12]  I'm glad.
[1223.12 --> 1224.12]  It's not the sleep.
[1224.12 --> 1225.12]  It's not the sleep so much as it is.
[1225.12 --> 1230.12]  Um, my wife would like to see me on Friday, I guess, is what it comes down to.
[1230.12 --> 1233.12]  Your wife actually wants to spend time with you.
[1233.12 --> 1234.12]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[1234.12 --> 1235.12]  It's kind of different.
[1235.12 --> 1236.12]  It's kind of different.
[1236.12 --> 1241.12]  But, uh, you know, I, I, I do, I do late shows on Wednesdays and late shows on Thursdays.
[1241.12 --> 1244.12]  And, and it's, uh, it's easier that way.
[1244.12 --> 1249.12]  Speaking of which, do take this time to pimp your podcast and anything else that you think
[1249.12 --> 1254.12]  people should definitely pay attention to you on Twitter guys, you need to follow Ryan
[1254.12 --> 1258.12]  on Twitter at PC per, but, uh, Ryan, tell them a little bit about what you do if they
[1258.12 --> 1259.12]  don't already know.
[1259.12 --> 1261.12]  I just kind of came into this with that assumption.
[1261.12 --> 1262.12]  Sure.
[1262.12 --> 1264.12]  Uh, so PC per.com is the website.
[1264.12 --> 1268.12]  We do hardware reviews of processors, motherboards, graphics cards.
[1268.12 --> 1273.12]  Uh, we do some laptops and some tablets and all that other, uh, hardware and gadgety
[1273.12 --> 1274.12]  type stuff.
[1274.12 --> 1276.12]  Uh, we've been doing this for a long time.
[1276.12 --> 1278.12]  I think it was something with somebody I've been doing this for a long time.
[1278.12 --> 1282.12]  I've been doing this for over 13 years, almost 14 years now.
[1282.12 --> 1283.12]  Yeah.
[1283.12 --> 1284.12]  You're old man.
[1284.12 --> 1285.12]  I am.
[1285.12 --> 1286.12]  Trust me.
[1286.12 --> 1287.12]  I'm 31.
[1287.12 --> 1291.12]  I feel like I'm 51 when I see how, how, how many people move around in this industry as
[1291.12 --> 1292.12]  it is.
[1292.12 --> 1294.12]  Um, but, uh, PC per.com is the website.
[1294.12 --> 1295.12]  We do a lot of cool stuff there.
[1295.12 --> 1300.12]  We have our podcast, uh, which you can get access to either the RSS or the videos or the
[1300.12 --> 1303.12]  audio files at PC per.com slash podcast.
[1303.12 --> 1306.12]  We record that on Wednesday nights, um, live as well.
[1306.12 --> 1309.12]  I think we have our own PC per.com slash live channel too.
[1309.12 --> 1311.12]  So if anybody's interested, just go to PC per.com.
[1311.12 --> 1315.12]  We've got a schedule on the right hand side for all of our live events.
[1315.12 --> 1318.12]  And then all of our reviews and articles are obviously throughout the website.
[1318.12 --> 1324.12]  In fact, that was how Ryan and I met was he invited me to be a guest on the PC per podcast,
[1324.12 --> 1327.12]  which I would of course be happy to do again for you, man.
[1327.12 --> 1329.12]  So, uh, definitely throwing that out there.
[1329.12 --> 1331.12]  He hasn't invited me back though.
[1331.12 --> 1332.12]  Since then.
[1332.12 --> 1338.12]  So I just want more people to see my face everywhere on the internet.
[1338.12 --> 1339.12]  Please Ryan.
[1339.12 --> 1345.12]  Well, see here, you don't even, I I'm, I'm, I'm left to a caricature of myself in the middle
[1345.12 --> 1346.12]  of the screen.
[1346.12 --> 1347.12]  For what it's worth.
[1347.12 --> 1348.12]  It's really sexy.
[1348.12 --> 1351.12]  I like the artwork with the coloring, with the green and the kind of matches the site
[1351.12 --> 1352.12]  design.
[1352.12 --> 1353.12]  I don't know if that was on purpose, but I liked that.
[1353.12 --> 1354.12]  My guy is awesome.
[1354.12 --> 1356.12]  Uh, it's actually diesel.
[1356.12 --> 1360.12]  The intern is the, uh, the guy who does all of our graphics and all that cool stuff.
[1360.12 --> 1362.12]  And I think he did a fantastic job.
[1362.12 --> 1363.12]  It's definitely on purpose.
[1363.12 --> 1366.12]  It's an intense, that's an intense photo of me.
[1366.12 --> 1369.12]  That's from, uh, that's from QuakeCon that I was at just a couple of weeks ago.
[1369.12 --> 1372.12]  I think that's the only still photo of him I have ever seen.
[1372.12 --> 1374.12]  No, there's one other one.
[1374.12 --> 1375.12]  Is there?
[1375.12 --> 1376.12]  Yeah.
[1376.12 --> 1378.12]  There are some funny ones going around.
[1378.12 --> 1382.12]  Uh, there's one from QuakeCon where somebody I'm wearing a flashing red cooler master,
[1382.12 --> 1387.12]  uh, Kanye West glasses and there's a guy in a horse mask behind me.
[1387.12 --> 1389.12]  So, look for that.
[1389.12 --> 1390.12]  Excellent.
[1390.12 --> 1391.12]  Oh, man.
[1391.12 --> 1397.12]  So, speaking of, uh, Kanye West, let's talk about one of the big things that PC Per has
[1397.12 --> 1402.12]  been doing that has sort of, uh, rubbed people the wrong way.
[1402.12 --> 1408.12]  Um, but, unlike Kanye West, has caused some definite positive change in the industry.
[1408.12 --> 1414.12]  And, of course, I want to talk about AMD's new frame pacing driver.
[1415.12 --> 1416.12]  Yeah.
[1416.12 --> 1417.12]  What do you want to know?
[1417.12 --> 1419.12]  It's, it's, it's much better.
[1419.12 --> 1422.12]  Thanks, man.
[1422.12 --> 1424.12]  So, uh, basically, here we go.
[1424.12 --> 1426.12]  This is one of the articles on PCPer.com.
[1426.12 --> 1428.12]  Guys, definitely check it out.
[1428.12 --> 1431.12]  If you search for a frame rating catalyst 13.8.
[1431.12 --> 1435.12]  Um, if you could summarize this in a nutshell, give us kind of the story.
[1435.12 --> 1441.12]  What you found out, what you reported back to AMD, what they said to you, and what eventually
[1441.12 --> 1444.12]  came out as 13.8.
[1444.12 --> 1450.12]  So, the, the drama has been going on for a long time, right, where we discovered that
[1450.12 --> 1451.12]  crossfire.
[1451.12 --> 1452.12]  Bad drama.
[1452.12 --> 1459.12]  AMD's multi-GPU technology has, has been producing some awkward results.
[1459.12 --> 1461.12]  Awkward is one way of putting it.
[1461.12 --> 1464.12]  Bad, they're very, they're, they're bad results.
[1464.12 --> 1469.12]  You were getting much lower observed frame rates than what you would appear to be getting
[1469.12 --> 1472.12]  when you looked at benchmark numbers and fraps and in most reviews.
[1472.12 --> 1478.12]  And, uh, that was, you know, we, we kind of, we worked out a new benchmarking system where
[1478.12 --> 1481.12]  we're actually capturing the output directly from the graphics card, uh, and then doing
[1481.12 --> 1486.12]  post-processing analyzation, analyzation rather, on that data.
[1486.12 --> 1488.12]  And it took a long time, right?
[1488.12 --> 1493.12]  So, the idea of micro stuttering, the idea that people who for years and years really have
[1493.12 --> 1498.12]  felt that, you know, when I am running multiple GPUs, it doesn't feel as smooth sometimes.
[1498.12 --> 1501.12]  As when I'm running on a single GPU.
[1501.12 --> 1507.12]  And that was almost as far as the analyzing got because it was impossible to quantify
[1507.12 --> 1511.12]  it in any meaningful way because when you ran your fraps benchmarks, it looked fine.
[1511.12 --> 1512.12]  And there was so much hearsay.
[1512.12 --> 1513.12]  Yeah.
[1513.12 --> 1514.12]  Sorry.
[1514.12 --> 1518.12]  Uh, yeah, there was, I mean, you went on any forum and there was a dozen people saying
[1518.12 --> 1522.12]  this and a dozen people saying that and no one agreed with anyone.
[1522.12 --> 1523.12]  Right.
[1523.12 --> 1525.12]  And everybody said, some people said, oh, I don't see it.
[1525.12 --> 1527.12]  And some people said, it's, it's horrendous.
[1527.12 --> 1531.12]  I cannot play on an, uh, SLI or crossfire system.
[1531.12 --> 1537.12]  And that went on basically since the reintroduction of multi GPU into the world of PC enthusiasts.
[1537.12 --> 1544.12]  Um, and so the, the advent of this, what we call frame rating, which is the ability to capture the output directly.
[1544.12 --> 1547.12]  I mean, the amount of data that this requires is, is tremendous.
[1547.12 --> 1562.12]  If we capture 2560 by 1440 at 60 Hertz, essentially emulating a display, we're talking about 400 to 425 megabytes per second of write that we have to, you know, get into a storage system to get raw, raw data out of it.
[1562.12 --> 1563.12]  So, and sustainable.
[1563.12 --> 1565.12]  If you drop one frame, you have to throw the whole thing away.
[1565.12 --> 1566.12]  Correct.
[1566.12 --> 1567.12]  Right.
[1567.12 --> 1570.12]  If you miss, if you miss one frame, all of the data he did was wrong.
[1570.12 --> 1574.12]  So it took us a while to figure out the right hardware combination and software combination and get that to work.
[1574.12 --> 1575.12]  But we have done it.
[1575.12 --> 1584.12]  And what we did over several, over several months and several articles was show here's where AMD is faulting their, their, their, their crossfire is not balanced.
[1584.12 --> 1590.12]  It's not pacing the frames out in a, in a comfortable way that makes the animation smooth on the screen.
[1590.12 --> 1594.12]  And AMD at first fought back about it.
[1594.12 --> 1599.12]  Uh, and then slowly, you know how you have like those five stages of acceptance, right?
[1599.12 --> 1603.12]  So you move in and you're angry at first and then you're denial.
[1603.12 --> 1612.12]  Yeah. Yeah. You deny it. And they eventually accepted it and they started work on a new driver and this was not a, a minor task.
[1612.12 --> 1618.12]  They had to rewrite much of their catalyst software stack in order to get this to work.
[1618.12 --> 1622.12]  Um, so they, they spent a lot of time and they put a lot of effort into getting this fixed.
[1622.12 --> 1632.12]  And with the catalyst 13.8 beta, they essentially have been able to, in my opinion, they haven't made it as good as what NVIDIA has done with their frame pacing, but it's close to me.
[1632.12 --> 1644.12]  I think that it's close enough that for the very specific situations, I would consider crossfire to be a fixed problem for AMD.
[1644.12 --> 1651.12]  When I started, I want to make sure I point out those situations are single monitor, uh, attachment, crossfire configurations.
[1651.12 --> 1664.12]  Oh, hold on Ryan. We're dropping, uh, we're dropping some frames on the stream here. Let's just see if, uh, it has to do with that. Sorry. Uh, so I think we're back now. It looks like we're not dropping any frames.
[1664.12 --> 1666.12]  And, uh, okay. Here we go.
[1666.12 --> 1668.12]  And, uh, okay. Here we go.
[1668.12 --> 1672.12]  And bringing Ryan back to the show.
[1672.12 --> 1678.12]  Oh, no. Well, we're trying to bring Ryan back to the show. Okay. Let's go ahead and give this one more try here.
[1678.12 --> 1681.12]  Man, I love this show. Anything can happen.
[1681.12 --> 1688.12]  You never know what's gonna happen. In theory, we've got like news and, uh,
[1688.12 --> 1691.12]  We should be WGH live. What's gonna happen live.
[1691.12 --> 1699.12]  Yeah. Like it could be absolutely anything. Oh, apparently, oh, Ryan Shroud is calling me. Yo dawg.
[1699.12 --> 1702.12]  Hey. That sounds like a connection again.
[1702.12 --> 1712.12]  Hey, you're back. Alright. Okay. So let's, whoop. Okay. Let's go to mine and Ryan's conversation. Apparently that's what we're gonna go to. Let's go. Let's go to, uh, here we go. This.
[1712.12 --> 1731.12]  Okay. So you were telling us about how AMD's drivers basically were not up to snuff. The observed frame rate was much lower. And they pretty much rewrote a huge part of their catalyst driver to release 13.8. And this is a graph from PCPR.com. Tell us about this.
[1731.12 --> 1741.12]  So, uh, what used to happen before 13.8 is that your framing is reported to be different than we consider the observed frame rate. And the blue frame rate...
[1741.12 --> 1751.12]  Hold on. Audio quality is, uh, deciding that it hates its life here. We're not dropping any frames on the stream yet. But, uh, let's...
[1751.12 --> 1752.12]  What?
[1752.12 --> 1756.12]  Hold on. Oh, we're dropping frames. Yeah. Okay. We're down.
[1756.12 --> 1770.12]  And we're back with reduced stream quality again, which is a most excellent thing. So, Ryan, let's pick up where we left off. Tell us about this graph right here to my camera.
[1770.12 --> 1771.12]  Right.
[1771.12 --> 1798.12]  So, uh, what the, what the graph used to tell us before the 13.8 driver is that there was a difference between what fraps would see, uh, in terms of performance and what our observed frame rate would see in terms of performance. And our observed frame rate took things out that were, we considered to call runt frames, frames that were too small to really matter or dropped frames that obviously never show up on the screen. Well, fraps sees things differently than what you do when you actually capture the frame rate.
[1798.12 --> 1828.12] 
[1828.12 --> 1841.12]  And then you send the data from the game engine to the next, uh, or for the next frame to the next GPU so that you get an even distribution of frames, both being rendered and thus being displayed on the screen at the same time.
[1841.12 --> 1861.92]  And it's a, it's more of an art than a science as it turns out because there's so much that happens between the game engine, direct decks, the GPU driver, and then the GPU hardware itself. Um, so it, it, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of something that it took a long time for them to be able to get right or close enough to write.
[1861.92 --> 1873.12]  And as I was saying earlier, like the 13.8 driver is a big enough step forward that I'm comfortable saying that AMD has fixed it for single monitor configuration.
[1873.12 --> 1893.56]  So if you have a 1920 by 1080 screen or a 2560 by 1440 resolution monitor and you have Crossfire 7970s or 7870s, or you have one of the 7990s, then I think that what AMD has done has improved things enough for me to start recommending those configurations again.
[1893.56 --> 1914.24]  I should also note it doesn't fix DX nine games. It only fixes DX 10 and 11. Um, that was more of a time issue for them, I guess, but DX nine games will, we'll go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt that, um, those tend to be lower demanding on your graphics cards. So, you know, if they had to put priorities someplace, DX 10 and 11 makes sense.
[1915.78 --> 1922.30]  Yep. And it's, it's not like that might come out when this isn't in beta anymore or something that could be a future feature.
[1922.30 --> 1925.06]  I mean, with that said, which are two is direct X nine.
[1925.36 --> 1925.58]  Yep.
[1925.74 --> 1930.76]  So yeah, still pretty important. And, but like I said, like it, it still could come.
[1931.24 --> 1950.10]  The other thing that I think is worth noting is this does not improve affinity configurations at all. So if you are a user that has a triple monitor setup for gaming, it's, it's very likely then that you will also have a crossfire configuration of some kind.
[1950.10 --> 1954.70]  Uh, and this, uh, this current driver does not fix that.
[1954.70 --> 1960.40]  AMD has said that they're working on improving that and getting that fixed address to those resolutions as well.
[1960.90 --> 1970.44]  Um, but I don't have a timetable for it and I don't really have a whole lot of confidence that they'll, they'll get that in place like before their next GPU launch even.
[1970.44 --> 1985.16]  Right. So actually that was, uh, that was one of those next things I was going to say is how important was the timing for AMD to get this driver fix for them to have a really compelling story around their upcoming GPUs.
[1985.16 --> 1996.96]  Because for a long time they had that timer on their website, uh, AMD world's fastest graphics card for however long running for them to be able to realistically claim a crown like that.
[1996.96 --> 2000.92]  It can't be like world's fastest graphics card asterisk.
[2000.92 --> 2005.60]  If you run at this particular resolution with this particular configuration in this particular.
[2007.60 --> 2007.84]  Right.
[2007.84 --> 2015.16]  No, I mean, the, the issue I had with that claim because the 7990 launch in the middle of all this kind of commotion.
[2015.82 --> 2016.02]  Right.
[2016.30 --> 2024.90]  So when 7990 came out, uh, it obviously depends on the crossfire to function any better than a single way that she's 7970.
[2024.90 --> 2028.50]  So there are claims of world's fastest graphics cards.
[2028.60 --> 2030.40]  I kind of shook my head and laughed at it.
[2030.54 --> 2036.36]  And it is, if you look at free market scores or if you look at fraps and you're not looking at kind of the experience of playing the game,
[2036.80 --> 2040.28]  then those claims could be made realistically.
[2041.06 --> 2048.00]  Uh, but the truth is it wasn't until this driver came out that I didn't think they had a realistic option of taking that claim.
[2048.00 --> 2055.02]  But, uh, the world of reality and the world of, of public relations and marketing and advertising are very different.
[2055.62 --> 2059.70]  Uh, and not just in computer hardware, but in most of the things that we're involved with in our life.
[2060.24 --> 2060.80]  Uh, right.
[2060.90 --> 2064.06]  So it didn't, it didn't surprise me, although it did.
[2064.74 --> 2072.52]  I think, uh, they got a lot of flack for it in the, in the online community and on forums and stuff like that from articles like mine that pointed out those flaws.
[2073.46 --> 2074.06]  All right.
[2074.06 --> 2076.40]  Well, you sound like you're on auto-tune.
[2076.40 --> 2082.92]  Uh, speaking of Kanye West again, because I think we're at the very limit of what our connection can sustain right now.
[2083.06 --> 2091.34]  I am very envious of you for even having the opportunity to pay however much too much you're paying for 30, 30 fiber,
[2091.62 --> 2094.48]  because I think it's time for us to move in that direction.
[2094.70 --> 2100.14]  I guess we'll have to let you go because we apparently can't do voice and video at the same time right now.
[2100.14 --> 2101.22]  But thank you, Ryan.
[2102.00 --> 2103.88]  Um, once again, guys.
[2104.38 --> 2104.76]  Oh, sorry.
[2104.84 --> 2105.12]  Go ahead.
[2105.48 --> 2105.96]  Absolutely.
[2105.96 --> 2109.38]  And, uh, if you guys, we can try to get another week.
[2109.50 --> 2112.18]  It's not a big deal once, uh, you get the internet figured out.
[2112.32 --> 2119.48]  And, uh, I'd love to come on and talk about these issues and more when we, we know more about next reviews that are coming up in CPUs as well.
[2119.98 --> 2120.46]  All right.
[2120.50 --> 2125.02]  Why don't we schedule you in tentatively for after AMD releases their new graphics cards?
[2125.02 --> 2134.24]  I'm really sorry to the viewers as well as you, Ryan, because I really had a few more topics that I wanted to touch on with you that I thought you were going to have some great contributions to.
[2134.24 --> 2140.24]  Um, so once again, guys, Ryan from PC Per, who talks like a robot.
[2140.96 --> 2143.72]  A little, a little bit more cuts in there, but that was pretty good.
[2143.72 --> 2144.60]  Yeah, I know, right?
[2144.60 --> 2144.72]  A little bit more cuts in there.
[2144.72 --> 2144.74]  Yeah, I know, right?
[2144.74 --> 2145.72]  A little bit more cuts in there.
[2145.72 --> 2146.58]  Yeah, I know, right?
[2146.58 --> 2147.06]  A little bit more cuts in there.
[2147.06 --> 2147.74]  Thanks, Ryan.
[2148.18 --> 2148.54]  Thanks.
[2150.22 --> 2152.28]  He really does sound like he's on auto-tune.
[2152.28 --> 2152.52]  Yeah.
[2153.72 --> 2155.98]  Okay, so hopefully this can hold.
[2155.98 --> 2162.74]  All right, hopefully Ryan's wife is okay with us taking up far too much of his time here tonight.
[2164.34 --> 2164.58]  And...
[2164.58 --> 2165.84]  Can I just...
[2165.84 --> 2167.14]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2167.20 --> 2167.56]  Nuke that.
[2167.68 --> 2168.04]  All right.
[2168.40 --> 2172.56]  So, back to the regular show here, guys.
[2172.62 --> 2179.16]  I'm sorry we weren't able to do some of the Twitter questions for Ryan due to the technical difficulties with our internet connection.
[2179.40 --> 2184.78]  We're going to get in touch with our provider and see if we can get some kind of whitelist thing going on.
[2184.78 --> 2185.78]  Are we on a callback list?
[2185.78 --> 2190.64]  I'm just scheduled on a callback, so I might be running at some point, but yeah.
[2190.74 --> 2191.12]  All right.
[2191.40 --> 2194.36]  So, yeah, they don't like how much bandwidth we're eating right now.
[2194.50 --> 2194.76]  No.
[2195.08 --> 2198.18]  Let's jump into the dangers of online impersonation.
[2198.40 --> 2199.16]  Yeah, let's do this.
[2199.16 --> 2201.86]  Which I think was an article by you, and this is awesome.
[2202.30 --> 2203.68]  This is freaking amazing.
[2204.02 --> 2210.88]  So, this website is actually like a buddy of mine from the industry's website.
[2211.06 --> 2212.20]  I'm not going to name any names.
[2212.20 --> 2217.08]  He actually recently left the company he was at, and it's just like his personal site.
[2217.08 --> 2220.02]  And I really hope it loads for me.
[2220.28 --> 2222.78]  It's, I'll, I'm just going to, I'm just going to stop.
[2222.96 --> 2224.08]  I'm just going to shut my computer down.
[2227.14 --> 2233.30]  Apparently, we can't even load a website in addition to what we're streaming right now.
[2233.36 --> 2240.78]  Like, we are at the very limits of what our internet connection can do, which is phenomenally disappointing.
[2240.78 --> 2243.76]  If you can hold, I'm just going to go around and turn off everything in the house.
[2244.40 --> 2245.94]  Yeah, just, just, just do it.
[2246.38 --> 2246.96]  Hit everything.
[2248.24 --> 2250.08]  There's another thing.
[2250.66 --> 2251.02]  Anyways.
[2251.18 --> 2252.16]  Oh, let me just deal with the dock.
[2252.24 --> 2252.78]  We'll be back in time.
[2253.58 --> 2254.08]  All right.
[2254.16 --> 2254.44]  Cool.
[2256.44 --> 2257.04]  So...
[2257.04 --> 2258.92]  Sorry.
[2258.92 --> 2264.54]  Our bit rate ain't, uh, ain't even that high there, guys.
[2266.30 --> 2268.64]  We're not, we're not asking for that much.
[2268.94 --> 2271.82]  We're trying to load a page that is all text right now.
[2276.70 --> 2278.28]  I'm going to take a sip of water.
[2279.04 --> 2280.04]  Calm my nerves.
[2282.00 --> 2285.06]  I'm going to, like, shut off Wi-Fi on my phone.
[2285.06 --> 2285.86]  Okay.
[2286.32 --> 2290.52]  Everything in the house is off or not connected to our internet at all.
[2290.76 --> 2294.00]  Except for the server, which I'm assuming you don't want me to do.
[2294.38 --> 2295.64]  Your laptop and that computer.
[2296.32 --> 2296.86]  All right.
[2299.10 --> 2299.50]  Okay.
[2299.50 --> 2299.62]  Yeah.
[2301.76 --> 2302.26]  You know what?
[2302.26 --> 2306.44]  So, there's a few topics that I can probably do without the pages.
[2306.86 --> 2307.48]  Hit it, man.
[2307.58 --> 2309.64]  If you can, if you can tweet the URLs, maybe, from your phone.
[2310.34 --> 2310.66]  Sure.
[2311.44 --> 2313.54]  We can get people to see the pages that way.
[2314.02 --> 2314.56]  All right.
[2314.56 --> 2317.36]  And I won't turn on my computer, but if you can bring me to the dock.
[2318.56 --> 2319.12]  All right.
[2319.26 --> 2319.82]  A little bit of a combo.
[2319.82 --> 2320.92]  Which URLs do you want?
[2321.18 --> 2321.44]  All right.
[2321.56 --> 2327.62]  So, there's Grand Theft Auto Online and Civilization Online are two things that were very recently launched.
[2327.90 --> 2328.42]  Okay, hold on.
[2328.48 --> 2332.54]  Let's talk Civ Online, because I want them to be able to watch the trailer with us optimally.
[2333.26 --> 2333.48]  Okay.
[2333.52 --> 2334.82]  So, is Civ Online even in here?
[2334.92 --> 2339.08]  Civ Online is not in here, but I was going to do it as a combo topic with Grand Theft Auto.
[2339.26 --> 2339.82]  Of course you were.
[2339.82 --> 2345.62]  I find it interesting that these companies like Civilization, Sid Meier Civilization, are
[2345.62 --> 2352.18]  releasing DLCs and planning new releases for their single-player games that have maybe a
[2352.18 --> 2354.84]  multiplayer component, but then are also releasing an online version.
[2355.84 --> 2358.50]  Like a non-numbered iteration online version of their game.
[2358.50 --> 2363.74]  So, GTA V is coming out soon, but then all these announcements about GTA Online.
[2365.00 --> 2366.80]  It's just kind of weird.
[2367.56 --> 2369.20]  It's an interesting market position.
[2370.34 --> 2371.86]  It looks very different.
[2372.82 --> 2378.04]  GTA Online is sandboxy like GTA V, but there's a lot of...
[2378.04 --> 2382.52]  You can make your own little combat levels, and you can customize...
[2382.52 --> 2383.68]  Is it just combat levels?
[2384.30 --> 2384.74]  All right.
[2384.76 --> 2385.40]  Here we go.
[2385.56 --> 2386.80]  3G to the rescue.
[2386.80 --> 2388.00]  Boom.
[2388.00 --> 2388.48]  Oh, nice.
[2389.92 --> 2391.38]  And here it is, folks.
[2391.46 --> 2396.18]  So, this is the GTA Online trailer, which looks absolutely amazing.
[2396.40 --> 2396.58]  Yep.
[2398.20 --> 2399.20]  I didn't even think about that.
[2399.38 --> 2399.60]  That's right.
[2401.80 --> 2407.16]  Rock Star Games is looking to bring the heart of the Grand Theft Auto experience to a living
[2407.16 --> 2409.36]  online world with multiple players.
[2410.98 --> 2414.34]  Just what you choose to do in that world is up to you.
[2414.34 --> 2417.64]  We're back at even lower quality.
[2418.38 --> 2419.96]  So, there you go, guys.
[2420.14 --> 2424.34]  Back to the GTA trailer that we left off on here.
[2424.34 --> 2429.90]  I'm going to try pressing that again.
[2432.80 --> 2435.32]  So, you can rob liquor stores.
[2435.60 --> 2440.26]  This is like a classic online multiplayer gameplay mode is kind of what they're calling it.
[2440.50 --> 2443.36]  And then they've got, like, golf because it's GTA or whatever.
[2443.36 --> 2447.40]  This looks awesome.
[2447.50 --> 2448.44]  I love sandbox games.
[2449.12 --> 2456.90]  You know, the thing that this trailer left me wondering about is can you, like, be a cop?
[2458.60 --> 2459.12]  Interesting.
[2459.52 --> 2460.56]  I doubt it.
[2461.00 --> 2461.48]  But interesting.
[2461.48 --> 2464.78]  So, here's just someone's, like, cool pad.
[2464.92 --> 2467.90]  And here's someone's, like, cool garage with cool cars in it.
[2468.04 --> 2473.72]  So, they've got racing game elements, FPS game elements, flying game elements.
[2474.10 --> 2480.32]  What appears to be, like, riptide, like, sort of, you know, water.
[2480.44 --> 2481.38]  Chatsby, whatever.
[2482.24 --> 2483.44]  They're going to have everything.
[2483.58 --> 2486.10]  My one thing is I hope they make it big enough.
[2486.62 --> 2487.86]  Because it's GTA Online.
[2488.00 --> 2489.76]  There's going to be a million people.
[2490.14 --> 2491.10]  Actually, more than that.
[2491.44 --> 2492.16]  Trying to play.
[2492.68 --> 2496.72]  Well, they claim that they're going to be constantly expanding the game world.
[2496.96 --> 2497.08]  Yeah.
[2497.30 --> 2500.10]  I just hope they start with it expanded enough.
[2500.20 --> 2501.50]  Because there's going to be a huge rush of people.
[2501.92 --> 2505.66]  They've got a map editor where they're saying they'll allow you to build your own levels
[2505.66 --> 2508.58]  and your own challenges and stuff like that.
[2508.68 --> 2510.40]  And it looks like a very solid map editor.
[2511.38 --> 2514.34]  Or try ones other people have made.
[2517.44 --> 2518.66]  So, there you have it, guys.
[2518.78 --> 2519.62]  GTA Online.
[2519.74 --> 2522.26]  So, you were tying this into Civilization Online.
[2522.52 --> 2522.78]  Civilization Online.
[2523.28 --> 2525.98]  I just find it interesting that games...
[2525.98 --> 2527.72]  We saw this a while back.
[2527.96 --> 2528.94]  And it didn't really take.
[2529.30 --> 2532.38]  And now it's kind of happening again where games are trying to release the, like,
[2532.76 --> 2534.82]  online nomenclature on the end of their game.
[2534.96 --> 2536.30]  Just release it and go with it.
[2536.72 --> 2538.62]  But I think it can actually work this time.
[2539.48 --> 2541.22]  Before, the infrastructure wasn't really there.
[2541.22 --> 2541.90]  Now it is.
[2542.34 --> 2545.36]  I think this GTA may be Civilization.
[2545.54 --> 2551.62]  But GTA More, I think, can actually run with this and have their more single-player, super-graphics, super-heavy,
[2552.18 --> 2553.68]  modifiable everything.
[2553.96 --> 2556.70]  Because the modding community behind GTA 4 is insane.
[2557.26 --> 2560.10]  Some of the screenshots for GTA 4 are just nuts.
[2560.10 --> 2563.24]  And really, really heavy single-player storyline.
[2563.48 --> 2565.72]  But then also have GTA Online.
[2566.48 --> 2567.74]  I think it was a really good move.
[2568.14 --> 2569.70]  It's interesting, but I think it was a really good move.
[2570.26 --> 2573.26]  So, Civilization 5 Online.
[2573.54 --> 2574.80]  Or Civilization Online.
[2574.94 --> 2576.00]  Or whatever you want to call it.
[2576.38 --> 2578.94]  Because it would be Civilization 6 by this point?
[2578.94 --> 2582.38]  It would be Civilization 6, if that's what you called it.
[2582.54 --> 2584.04]  But then it acts differently.
[2584.70 --> 2589.46]  Because you can, like, it is much more online than Civilization 5 is.
[2589.56 --> 2593.20]  Because Civilization is one of the worst multiplayer experiences ever.
[2593.20 --> 2601.00]  I mean, I've been trying to get a Civilization online game completed since, like, Civ 2, Test of Time.
[2601.28 --> 2606.72]  They have a freaking option so that you can have it so it sends out an email when it's someone's turn.
[2607.62 --> 2611.22]  So they can log in and then do their turn and then people can wait.
[2611.60 --> 2613.48]  So it's going to be more like Words with Friends.
[2613.52 --> 2615.24]  No, I'm talking about Civ 5.
[2615.90 --> 2616.54]  Oh, the existing.
[2616.64 --> 2617.72]  Like, yeah.
[2617.94 --> 2621.40]  The newer one is supposed to be a perpetual environment, which is interesting.
[2621.40 --> 2625.96]  And I think this might fix their whole awkward online situation that they've had for a long time.
[2626.34 --> 2628.30]  So it's going to be a real-time game.
[2629.32 --> 2632.40]  Because you'd lose a lot of the Civilization heart.
[2633.16 --> 2637.02]  You have your, like, okay, I don't know if there's not enough information out there yet.
[2637.06 --> 2638.28]  Or I just haven't been able to find it.
[2638.34 --> 2640.42]  But you have your kind of perpetual main city.
[2640.82 --> 2643.00]  And then you can make expansions and push out.
[2643.32 --> 2644.28]  And those can be destroyed.
[2644.40 --> 2645.60]  But I think your main city can't.
[2646.12 --> 2646.44]  Hmm.
[2647.42 --> 2648.02]  Fascinating.
[2648.02 --> 2648.82]  Although I could definitely be wrong.
[2648.82 --> 2651.00]  Someone correct me on Twitter, which I can't check.
[2651.00 --> 2652.36]  But yes, do so.
[2652.92 --> 2653.92]  We'll get that later.
[2655.38 --> 2655.82]  Yeah.
[2657.28 --> 2657.94]  All right.
[2658.02 --> 2659.78]  Well, that's kind of exciting.
[2659.98 --> 2667.78]  Speaking of extremely crazy, exciting trailers, guys, check this out.
[2669.18 --> 2671.28]  So if any children are watching, stop.
[2671.74 --> 2672.04]  Yes.
[2673.02 --> 2675.14]  And there's a bunch of, like, awards and whatnot.
[2675.14 --> 2678.28]  So this is the Witcher 3 trailer.
[2684.06 --> 2686.38]  By order of the Emperor of Milfgaard.
[2686.86 --> 2689.14]  For the murder of the wounded, looting...
[2689.74 --> 2691.04]  Okay, I've got to stop this for a second.
[2691.14 --> 2692.42]  Did you just call it Milfgaard?
[2692.42 --> 2698.48]  They're trying to protect their women.
[2702.48 --> 2702.84]  Anibalism.
[2703.56 --> 2706.28]  You are hereby sentenced to death by hanging.
[2707.88 --> 2709.20]  Okay, now hold on a second.
[2709.76 --> 2715.24]  They call the place Milfgaard, and then they're sentencing this woman to death by hanging?
[2715.44 --> 2716.58]  I mean, are they guarding them?
[2716.58 --> 2720.60]  Mind you, she's not even that old.
[2721.46 --> 2721.84]  Anyway.
[2721.84 --> 2722.24]  No.
[2722.24 --> 2723.08]  Dorment.
[2733.08 --> 2734.44]  Don't meddle.
[2734.74 --> 2736.46]  Take the reward, and let's go.
[2736.80 --> 2737.62]  Help me!
[2741.62 --> 2745.44]  Knew you witches wouldn't scorn Imperial Goals.
[2746.58 --> 2749.46]  I'm sorry.
[2749.46 --> 2749.58]  It's a good one.
[2749.58 --> 2750.06]  I'm sorry.
[2750.08 --> 2750.80]  It's a good one.
[2750.80 --> 2751.20]  It's a good one.
[2751.20 --> 2751.88]  I'm sorry.
[2751.88 --> 2752.24]  I'm sorry.
[2754.04 --> 2755.54]  Evil is evil.
[2756.12 --> 2759.70]  Lesser, greater, middling, makes no difference.
[2760.88 --> 2762.08]  Come sit me.
[2762.46 --> 2763.14]  Bring her down.
[2763.38 --> 2764.22]  Do it my way.
[2764.42 --> 2765.46]  You like that, you bitch?
[2765.60 --> 2766.16]  Get the hammer.
[2767.28 --> 2768.18]  Get our teeth in.
[2768.88 --> 2770.40]  The degree is arbitrary.
[2771.00 --> 2772.26]  The definition is blurred.
[2772.78 --> 2775.12]  If I'm to choose between one evil and another,
[2775.12 --> 2777.88]  I'd rather not choose at all.
[2779.40 --> 2781.24]  Just make it quick, Geralt.
[2783.18 --> 2783.74]  What the?
[2789.28 --> 2790.30]  Close your eyes.
[2792.64 --> 2794.22]  I bet she doesn't close her eyes.
[2794.22 --> 2813.68]  What are you doing?
[2814.12 --> 2815.56]  Killing monsters.
[2815.56 --> 2819.70]  All right, so that was kind of the punchline there.
[2819.84 --> 2821.52]  Killing monsters, and there's a big...
[2821.52 --> 2824.94]  And we're hopefully back, so...
[2824.94 --> 2828.38]  Anyway, guys, our ISP says through Twitter
[2828.38 --> 2830.72]  that they are not throttling us.
[2830.82 --> 2832.68]  We have no idea what else it would be.
[2833.44 --> 2835.36]  However, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
[2835.58 --> 2836.38]  Maybe they're not.
[2836.70 --> 2837.34]  I don't know.
[2837.74 --> 2839.36]  But it looks an awful lot like that,
[2839.36 --> 2841.32]  because as soon as we start streaming up,
[2841.64 --> 2844.44]  our internet connection goes into the toilet
[2844.44 --> 2846.56]  and decides to...
[2846.56 --> 2847.12]  It works.
[2848.20 --> 2848.76]  It works.
[2849.02 --> 2850.22]  Just very poorly.
[2850.36 --> 2851.80]  Very, very, very slow.
[2851.94 --> 2853.82]  You guys saw what the symptoms looked like,
[2853.88 --> 2855.16]  so what would happen was
[2855.16 --> 2857.40]  Ryan's voice communication with us
[2857.40 --> 2858.42]  would get very garbled,
[2858.88 --> 2860.22]  but things are getting through
[2860.22 --> 2863.36]  until it screeches to a halt,
[2863.36 --> 2864.58]  so it really feels like
[2864.58 --> 2869.04]  whatever's being done is whatever.
[2869.44 --> 2872.06]  I really can't think of anything else
[2872.06 --> 2873.16]  that would cause something like this.
[2873.28 --> 2876.42]  Linus even started doing his laptop off 3G
[2876.42 --> 2877.26]  instead of our Wi-Fi,
[2877.36 --> 2879.20]  so the only computer in the entire house
[2879.20 --> 2880.98]  running off the internet was this desktop.
[2882.08 --> 2882.84]  So we'll have a look.
[2883.36 --> 2885.32]  Shaw is telling the people that tweet them
[2885.32 --> 2888.08]  about me being fraudled
[2888.08 --> 2890.22]  that I should direct message them
[2890.22 --> 2890.98]  and they'll get it addressed,
[2891.10 --> 2892.34]  so I have direct messaged them.
[2892.34 --> 2893.70]  Hopefully they'll get it addressed.
[2893.82 --> 2895.04]  Hopefully we won't go down again,
[2895.12 --> 2896.70]  so let's just keep this rolling.
[2897.18 --> 2899.02]  So good trailer or bad trailer?
[2899.16 --> 2900.60]  The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt trailer.
[2901.18 --> 2903.58]  I think it was a good trailer.
[2904.32 --> 2904.68]  Okay.
[2904.92 --> 2905.50]  Do you think it's a good trailer?
[2905.50 --> 2906.90]  But that depends on what you're looking for.
[2907.34 --> 2910.24]  Because there was no in-game material whatsoever.
[2910.24 --> 2912.12]  That's why I said it depends on what you're looking for.
[2912.24 --> 2912.56]  Okay.
[2912.98 --> 2914.92]  There's a difference between an in-game trailer
[2914.92 --> 2915.70]  and a hype trailer.
[2915.82 --> 2916.74]  This was a hype trailer.
[2917.10 --> 2919.50]  I personally like in-game trailers more,
[2919.62 --> 2921.12]  but still appreciate hype trailers.
[2921.12 --> 2923.52]  I just wish they would have released an in-game trailer first.
[2923.82 --> 2925.54]  Because the Grand Theft Auto Online trailer
[2925.54 --> 2929.22]  pretty much sold that game to anyone who watched it.
[2929.32 --> 2929.52]  Yep.
[2929.68 --> 2930.52]  Whereas The Witcher 3...
[2930.52 --> 2932.76]  Because what's the difference between hype
[2932.76 --> 2934.66]  and selling the game?
[2935.14 --> 2935.48]  Like...
[2935.48 --> 2936.98]  It's still selling the game, though.
[2937.32 --> 2937.82]  But...
[2937.82 --> 2938.68]  Okay.
[2938.94 --> 2939.54]  It's drawing...
[2939.54 --> 2939.90]  Well, okay.
[2939.96 --> 2941.14]  It's drawing interest to it.
[2941.20 --> 2942.40]  Now everyone knows...
[2942.40 --> 2943.56]  Everyone's seen this video now.
[2943.90 --> 2945.16]  It's been around so much.
[2945.20 --> 2946.14]  It's been tweeted around so much.
[2946.14 --> 2947.72]  Now they're interested.
[2947.94 --> 2949.48]  Now hopefully they'll get off their butts
[2949.48 --> 2951.42]  and release a gameplay trailer fast enough
[2951.42 --> 2952.90]  and that will sell people.
[2953.00 --> 2954.38]  I mean, here's my problem, too.
[2954.48 --> 2955.64]  Like, I actually...
[2955.64 --> 2957.80]  Like, I didn't play through a huge part of the campaign
[2957.80 --> 2958.16]  or anything,
[2958.26 --> 2960.18]  but I've got a few hours on Witcher 2.
[2960.30 --> 2961.14]  I've got...
[2961.14 --> 2963.44]  I think around five or six hours on Witcher 1.
[2963.56 --> 2965.24]  Like, I played through some.
[2966.04 --> 2967.26]  They didn't suck me in.
[2967.72 --> 2968.14]  At all.
[2968.34 --> 2969.80]  And that trailer
[2969.80 --> 2972.10]  looked absolutely nothing like Witcher gameplay.
[2972.72 --> 2973.12]  Yeah.
[2973.12 --> 2973.56]  Nothing.
[2973.82 --> 2976.04]  What I liked about Witcher 1
[2976.04 --> 2979.00]  was the insane amount of customization and stuff
[2979.00 --> 2980.50]  and the insane amount of things that you had to do
[2980.50 --> 2981.50]  depending on who you were fighting.
[2982.68 --> 2985.18]  But didn't find the rest of it very engaging
[2985.18 --> 2986.10]  so didn't keep playing.
[2986.32 --> 2987.56]  I could tell that it was a good game.
[2987.70 --> 2988.64]  I just...
[2988.64 --> 2990.44]  I just wanted to do other things.
[2990.94 --> 2992.02]  And then Witcher 2,
[2992.30 --> 2994.08]  I got to this, like, port city
[2994.08 --> 2996.62]  and was just like,
[2996.90 --> 2997.84]  what do I do?
[2997.98 --> 2999.10]  This isn't sandbox enough
[2999.10 --> 3000.26]  that I can do anything I want,
[3000.26 --> 3002.88]  but then it's not straight line enough
[3002.88 --> 3004.18]  that I have no idea
[3004.18 --> 3005.30]  what I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[3005.78 --> 3007.10]  Which was...
[3007.10 --> 3007.76]  I don't know.
[3008.00 --> 3008.72]  I could have looked it up,
[3008.88 --> 3009.36]  but I was like,
[3009.44 --> 3011.34]  meh, I'm just going to go do other stuff.
[3012.66 --> 3013.10]  Right.
[3013.38 --> 3014.64]  So, I don't know.
[3014.84 --> 3016.48]  I guess we'll see.
[3016.90 --> 3017.78]  But, I mean,
[3017.86 --> 3018.82]  from my perspective,
[3018.96 --> 3020.84]  as much as I enjoy watching
[3020.84 --> 3021.96]  these cinematic trailers,
[3022.10 --> 3023.36]  like the Dead Island trailer.
[3023.72 --> 3024.58]  Oh my goodness.
[3024.80 --> 3025.82]  That was awesome.
[3026.66 --> 3028.06]  But that's the point of hype trailers.
[3028.16 --> 3029.38]  Like, hype trailers are still interesting.
[3029.38 --> 3030.70]  Like, I still remember that.
[3030.70 --> 3031.06]  Yeah.
[3031.20 --> 3032.28]  Never was even tempted
[3032.28 --> 3033.62]  for a second to buy the game,
[3033.70 --> 3034.44]  especially once I heard
[3034.44 --> 3035.28]  how terrible it was.
[3036.26 --> 3036.92]  You're talking about
[3036.92 --> 3037.92]  the super slow-mo one
[3037.92 --> 3038.92]  where everything's going backwards
[3038.92 --> 3041.40]  and there's their daughter
[3041.40 --> 3042.56]  and she flies out the window.
[3042.88 --> 3043.16]  Yeah.
[3043.94 --> 3044.68]  Outstanding trailer.
[3044.74 --> 3044.92]  So good.
[3045.10 --> 3046.00]  That's one of the few trailers
[3046.00 --> 3046.98]  that I remember the whole thing of.
[3047.10 --> 3047.64]  Never bought the game,
[3047.68 --> 3048.16]  never played it.
[3048.44 --> 3049.56]  But, the thing is,
[3049.62 --> 3051.38]  they have to continue it.
[3051.74 --> 3052.58]  You have to roll off
[3052.58 --> 3053.22]  of a hype trailer.
[3053.34 --> 3054.24]  So you release a hype trailer
[3054.24 --> 3054.94]  and then you have to release
[3054.94 --> 3055.68]  other stuff.
[3056.84 --> 3057.38]  Release, like,
[3057.40 --> 3058.18]  a little bit of gameplay.
[3058.18 --> 3059.20]  Like, Battlefield.
[3059.86 --> 3061.40]  They released some hype stuff
[3061.40 --> 3062.02]  and then they released
[3062.02 --> 3062.38]  the, like,
[3062.68 --> 3064.20]  14 minutes of gameplay
[3064.20 --> 3064.88]  or whatever it was.
[3064.92 --> 3065.14]  Okay.
[3065.30 --> 3065.92]  That was smart.
[3066.18 --> 3066.96]  That was Battlefield 4.
[3067.08 --> 3068.52]  So good timing would be Gamescom
[3068.52 --> 3070.16]  to actually release
[3070.16 --> 3071.20]  the gameplay.
[3071.52 --> 3072.08]  That would be perfect.
[3072.26 --> 3073.02]  If they do that,
[3073.10 --> 3073.74]  that would be, like,
[3073.76 --> 3075.44]  a very, very good transition.
[3076.82 --> 3077.82]  I hope they do that.
[3078.92 --> 3079.28]  Okay.
[3079.68 --> 3080.28]  So that would probably,
[3080.28 --> 3080.82]  that would probably be
[3080.82 --> 3081.70]  about the right time for that.
[3081.72 --> 3083.14]  CD Projekt's an awesome company.
[3083.48 --> 3085.06]  CD Projekt Red is just great.
[3085.20 --> 3085.64]  So I just,
[3085.74 --> 3086.40]  I hope they do it.
[3086.40 --> 3087.48]  All right.
[3087.58 --> 3088.46]  So let's move into
[3088.46 --> 3089.58]  our next topic,
[3089.94 --> 3092.52]  which is Google blocks
[3092.52 --> 3094.98]  the Windows Phone YouTube app.
[3095.10 --> 3096.28]  So Google is claiming
[3096.28 --> 3098.28]  that Microsoft didn't follow
[3098.28 --> 3099.44]  their guidelines.
[3100.16 --> 3101.48]  Their guidelines sounded
[3101.48 --> 3103.62]  pretty douchebaggy to me.
[3103.96 --> 3104.06]  Yeah.
[3104.86 --> 3105.14]  Yep.
[3105.82 --> 3108.18]  So I actually didn't really
[3108.18 --> 3109.38]  like The Verge's coverage
[3109.38 --> 3110.32]  of this particular,
[3110.64 --> 3111.88]  this particular thing.
[3111.96 --> 3112.30]  However,
[3112.44 --> 3113.04]  here's the link
[3113.04 --> 3114.10]  to TheVerge.com.
[3114.46 --> 3115.56]  Google blocks Microsoft's
[3115.56 --> 3116.66]  new YouTube Windows Phone app.
[3116.84 --> 3118.32]  So here's the basic story.
[3119.10 --> 3120.42]  Google has said,
[3120.84 --> 3121.52]  we're not going to build
[3121.52 --> 3122.24]  a YouTube app
[3122.24 --> 3123.58]  for Windows Phone 8.
[3124.36 --> 3124.74]  Okay.
[3125.08 --> 3126.14]  So Microsoft's all like,
[3126.20 --> 3126.48]  okay,
[3126.84 --> 3127.80]  well, we'll make one.
[3127.80 --> 3128.44]  We'll do it, yeah.
[3128.52 --> 3129.38]  At our own expense.
[3129.56 --> 3130.80]  Just give us,
[3130.90 --> 3131.50]  you know,
[3132.34 --> 3133.54]  access to the API.
[3133.80 --> 3134.90]  Let us do these things.
[3135.46 --> 3136.28]  So then,
[3136.28 --> 3137.76]  Microsoft released one
[3137.76 --> 3138.72]  that was actually
[3138.72 --> 3140.16]  pretty excellent.
[3140.16 --> 3141.42]  There wasn't very many errors
[3141.42 --> 3142.98]  with it until Google
[3142.98 --> 3144.38]  dropped the...
[3144.38 --> 3144.92]  Well, hold on.
[3145.14 --> 3145.26]  No,
[3145.38 --> 3145.68]  Microsoft,
[3145.84 --> 3146.52]  Google made them
[3146.52 --> 3147.50]  pull the first one.
[3147.94 --> 3148.38]  First.
[3148.50 --> 3148.94]  Okay, so,
[3149.02 --> 3149.52]  okay, yeah.
[3149.58 --> 3151.02]  So Microsoft broke
[3151.02 --> 3152.54]  a couple of Google's rules,
[3153.08 --> 3153.94]  so it allowed
[3153.94 --> 3155.26]  downloading videos,
[3155.26 --> 3156.84]  and it also didn't
[3156.84 --> 3158.04]  display any ads.
[3158.56 --> 3158.84]  Okay.
[3158.98 --> 3159.88]  So Google wasn't
[3159.88 --> 3160.96]  super thrilled about that.
[3161.20 --> 3161.58]  It's not surprising.
[3161.84 --> 3162.44]  They're all like,
[3162.56 --> 3163.16]  well, no,
[3163.76 --> 3165.00]  stop that,
[3165.22 --> 3166.62]  and we need you guys
[3166.62 --> 3167.64]  to integrate support
[3167.64 --> 3168.42]  for ads,
[3168.60 --> 3169.78]  and you need to remove
[3169.78 --> 3170.56]  that functionality
[3170.56 --> 3171.26]  where people can
[3171.26 --> 3172.02]  download videos.
[3172.24 --> 3173.42]  So Microsoft was all like,
[3173.46 --> 3173.72]  okay,
[3174.38 --> 3175.52]  back to the drawing board.
[3175.72 --> 3176.84]  We're going to go ahead
[3176.84 --> 3177.96]  and do those things,
[3178.18 --> 3178.68]  and hey,
[3178.74 --> 3179.74]  we're going to add
[3179.74 --> 3180.20]  the functionality
[3180.20 --> 3181.30]  to upload videos
[3181.30 --> 3182.08]  while we're at it.
[3182.08 --> 3183.62]  So they re-released it,
[3183.84 --> 3186.70]  and Google has pulled it again.
[3187.24 --> 3189.34]  And they just dropped API.
[3189.78 --> 3190.42]  So all these people
[3190.42 --> 3191.22]  that are using it,
[3191.24 --> 3192.58]  it just randomly stops working.
[3192.82 --> 3193.16]  Yeah.
[3193.78 --> 3195.28]  And what they're claiming
[3195.28 --> 3198.84]  is that Microsoft's implementation,
[3199.92 --> 3201.78]  and Microsoft actually has
[3201.78 --> 3202.98]  an awesome,
[3203.28 --> 3203.56]  like,
[3203.92 --> 3205.56]  awesome public letter
[3205.56 --> 3207.02]  right now to Google
[3207.02 --> 3208.80]  where they basically are like,
[3209.32 --> 3210.00]  yo, dog,
[3210.18 --> 3211.84]  you didn't build H2P.
[3212.08 --> 3213.16]  HTML5 versions
[3213.16 --> 3214.52]  of your YouTube app
[3214.52 --> 3216.16]  for iOS or Android.
[3216.84 --> 3217.70]  In fact,
[3218.06 --> 3219.18]  behind closed doors,
[3219.62 --> 3221.06]  you've agreed with us
[3221.06 --> 3222.08]  that HTML5
[3222.72 --> 3225.12]  is more of a long-term goal,
[3225.64 --> 3226.66]  and in the meantime,
[3227.24 --> 3228.80]  we have to have something
[3228.80 --> 3229.64]  to give our users,
[3230.06 --> 3232.32]  so that's why we did it this way.
[3233.74 --> 3234.06]  You know,
[3234.46 --> 3236.16]  I thought your whole business model
[3236.16 --> 3237.08]  was you want people
[3237.08 --> 3238.12]  using your services,
[3238.48 --> 3239.76]  not that you're going to try
[3239.76 --> 3240.40]  to differentiate
[3240.40 --> 3241.64]  your platform,
[3242.00 --> 3242.50]  Android,
[3243.00 --> 3244.38]  based on...
[3244.38 --> 3245.42]  Allowing people
[3245.42 --> 3246.20]  to access YouTube
[3246.20 --> 3246.80]  through an app.
[3246.98 --> 3248.74]  I heard slightly...
[3248.74 --> 3249.96]  I heard that,
[3250.12 --> 3252.00]  but in way more vague terms,
[3252.78 --> 3253.28]  which is...
[3253.28 --> 3254.22]  It's interesting to hear that,
[3254.28 --> 3255.40]  but was that in a different article?
[3255.82 --> 3257.34]  That was in Microsoft's
[3257.34 --> 3258.22]  open letter.
[3258.48 --> 3259.44]  Just Microsoft's open letter.
[3259.52 --> 3260.00]  Okay, cool.
[3260.28 --> 3261.46]  Because I heard just statements
[3261.46 --> 3262.26]  of Google being like,
[3262.30 --> 3262.96]  oh, you didn't follow
[3262.96 --> 3263.46]  our guidelines
[3263.46 --> 3264.96]  for the back end.
[3265.16 --> 3265.92]  That's what I heard.
[3265.92 --> 3268.46]  You had to make it HTML5.
[3268.52 --> 3269.44]  That's really interesting.
[3269.54 --> 3269.74]  Oh, no.
[3269.80 --> 3271.72]  Their letter is fantastic.
[3272.34 --> 3273.44]  I absolutely love it.
[3273.50 --> 3275.94]  Let me just pull up a link.
[3276.02 --> 3277.06]  Yeah, Microsoft is hoping
[3277.06 --> 3278.96]  that a public message
[3278.96 --> 3281.92]  detailing the injustices...
[3282.44 --> 3283.02]  Here it is.
[3283.16 --> 3283.86]  They call it
[3283.86 --> 3286.64]  the limits of Google's openness.
[3288.84 --> 3289.92]  You may be...
[3289.92 --> 3291.60]  So this is from their corporate VP
[3291.60 --> 3292.90]  and deputy general counsel
[3292.90 --> 3294.58]  litigation and antitrust,
[3294.94 --> 3295.34]  Microsoft.
[3295.34 --> 3295.84]  Whoa.
[3296.28 --> 3296.66]  Oh, yeah.
[3296.84 --> 3298.04]  No, this is not like
[3298.04 --> 3299.48]  engineers, like,
[3299.84 --> 3300.86]  firing shots across
[3300.86 --> 3301.74]  each other's bows.
[3301.88 --> 3303.34]  This is the big dogs
[3303.34 --> 3304.78]  getting involved here.
[3305.32 --> 3307.02]  So this gives the whole history
[3307.02 --> 3308.40]  of what went on
[3308.40 --> 3310.08]  and also says,
[3310.16 --> 3311.90]  Google raises concerns
[3311.90 --> 3312.78]  about their branding.
[3312.98 --> 3314.10]  The funny thing about this point
[3314.10 --> 3314.82]  is we've been using
[3314.82 --> 3316.24]  the same branding since 2010
[3316.24 --> 3318.10]  for an inferior YouTube app.
[3318.22 --> 3319.08]  Now that we have an app
[3319.08 --> 3319.62]  that gives users
[3319.62 --> 3320.90]  a fuller YouTube experience,
[3321.08 --> 3321.68]  all of a sudden
[3321.68 --> 3322.72]  they object to the branding.
[3323.26 --> 3323.64]  Finally,
[3323.76 --> 3324.24]  Google cites
[3324.24 --> 3325.46]  a degraded experience.
[3325.64 --> 3326.52]  Since 2010,
[3326.62 --> 3327.58]  Google has been permitting
[3327.58 --> 3328.92]  a way worse one.
[3329.86 --> 3331.60]  And reviews of our new app
[3331.60 --> 3332.26]  are unanimous
[3332.26 --> 3332.84]  that the experience
[3332.84 --> 3333.70]  is much improved.
[3333.82 --> 3334.76]  We're committed
[3334.76 --> 3335.60]  to continuing
[3335.60 --> 3336.34]  to make adjustments.
[3336.50 --> 3338.18]  If Google were truly concerned
[3338.18 --> 3339.94]  about a degraded experience,
[3340.62 --> 3342.14]  it would allow our users
[3342.14 --> 3343.70]  to access the new YouTube app
[3343.70 --> 3344.28]  that they love.
[3345.26 --> 3346.48]  We think it's clear
[3346.48 --> 3348.02]  that Google just doesn't want
[3348.02 --> 3348.92]  Windows phone users
[3348.92 --> 3350.18]  to have the same experience
[3350.18 --> 3352.46]  as Apple and Android users.
[3352.80 --> 3354.86]  The statement from before
[3354.86 --> 3356.22]  where they're questioning
[3356.22 --> 3357.04]  Google's openness,
[3357.90 --> 3358.86]  that's very interesting
[3358.86 --> 3359.70]  because you know
[3359.70 --> 3361.20]  their 20% campaign
[3361.20 --> 3362.04]  that they had going on?
[3362.64 --> 3363.20]  Are we dropped?
[3364.80 --> 3365.28]  Apparently,
[3365.40 --> 3366.14]  we're not down.
[3366.80 --> 3367.36]  I can still hear us.
[3367.62 --> 3367.90]  Okay,
[3368.10 --> 3369.76]  so what I was going to talk about.
[3370.02 --> 3370.36]  Apparently,
[3370.46 --> 3371.60]  we're a podcast now.
[3371.92 --> 3372.96]  That sounds good to me.
[3372.96 --> 3376.36]  Google's 20% thing
[3376.36 --> 3377.96]  where they would let employees
[3377.96 --> 3379.34]  spend one day of their week
[3379.34 --> 3381.02]  working on side projects,
[3381.34 --> 3382.10]  whatever they wanted to do.
[3382.46 --> 3382.96]  And then there was
[3382.96 --> 3384.24]  the Google Labs project
[3384.24 --> 3384.98]  where you could see
[3384.98 --> 3385.82]  all these little random
[3385.82 --> 3386.36]  side projects
[3386.36 --> 3386.90]  and some of them
[3386.90 --> 3387.78]  turned into big things.
[3387.96 --> 3388.60]  Like there was a,
[3388.80 --> 3389.52]  I think Google Plus
[3389.52 --> 3391.72]  started as one of the lab projects.
[3391.88 --> 3392.44]  I believe.
[3392.52 --> 3393.50]  I'm not entirely sure.
[3393.80 --> 3395.52]  It says that we're streaming.
[3395.68 --> 3396.02]  However,
[3396.24 --> 3397.90]  we dropped frames immediately.
[3398.22 --> 3399.78]  So we're back potentially
[3399.78 --> 3401.32]  at 240p.
[3401.32 --> 3406.20]  We've got people asking
[3406.20 --> 3407.80]  all kinds of inane questions
[3407.80 --> 3408.78]  on Twitch chat.
[3409.00 --> 3409.30]  No,
[3409.44 --> 3410.82]  we're not uploading videos
[3410.82 --> 3411.80]  right now
[3411.80 --> 3413.46]  separately on the connection
[3413.46 --> 3415.58]  because we aren't stupid.
[3416.98 --> 3417.54]  Yeah,
[3417.76 --> 3418.34]  definitely not.
[3418.50 --> 3420.12]  I individually went around
[3420.12 --> 3421.14]  the entire office
[3421.14 --> 3422.50]  and shut off everything.
[3423.16 --> 3424.66]  Every computer in the house
[3424.66 --> 3425.40]  is off.
[3425.82 --> 3426.64]  Even my laptop
[3426.64 --> 3428.50]  is tethered to my phone
[3428.50 --> 3429.60]  at, of course,
[3429.68 --> 3431.06]  a much higher expense
[3431.06 --> 3432.90]  than a landline
[3432.90 --> 3433.70]  which should in theory
[3433.70 --> 3434.42]  be giving me
[3434.42 --> 3437.48]  a reasonably decent connection.
[3438.86 --> 3439.46]  All right.
[3439.64 --> 3441.66]  So we're back at 240p.
[3442.24 --> 3442.76]  Boom.
[3443.56 --> 3444.14]  Let's, uh...
[3444.14 --> 3444.88]  2013, here we come.
[3445.22 --> 3445.98]  Yeah, I know, right?
[3446.84 --> 3448.64]  What were we even talking about?
[3449.00 --> 3450.26]  I had segued us
[3450.26 --> 3451.56]  into Google
[3451.56 --> 3453.62]  changing their whole idea
[3453.62 --> 3454.44]  because for the longest
[3454.44 --> 3455.00]  point in time,
[3455.10 --> 3456.80]  Google was this super open company.
[3457.00 --> 3457.22]  Yes.
[3457.30 --> 3457.98]  That shared everything
[3457.98 --> 3458.60]  with everyone,
[3458.88 --> 3460.02]  tried to make everything free.
[3461.02 --> 3461.74]  Who's here?
[3462.10 --> 3463.22]  Uh, probably B-roll.
[3463.66 --> 3464.02]  Okay.
[3464.56 --> 3465.18]  Uh, shared everything
[3465.18 --> 3465.54]  with everyone,
[3465.62 --> 3466.60]  tried to make everything free
[3466.60 --> 3467.46]  and was just
[3467.46 --> 3469.18]  making all this money
[3469.18 --> 3470.24]  but giving everything out
[3470.24 --> 3471.14]  which was interesting,
[3471.42 --> 3471.62]  cool,
[3471.70 --> 3472.16]  and it worked.
[3472.16 --> 3473.66]  And then now they seem
[3473.66 --> 3474.72]  to be batting down
[3474.72 --> 3475.20]  the hatches,
[3475.26 --> 3476.18]  closing everything down
[3476.18 --> 3477.86]  and just totally not being
[3477.86 --> 3478.82]  the nice open,
[3479.38 --> 3481.06]  nice in big quotes there,
[3481.44 --> 3482.32]  um, program,
[3482.52 --> 3483.00]  or company
[3483.00 --> 3483.92]  that we've known them for.
[3484.08 --> 3485.28]  So one of the big things
[3485.28 --> 3486.02]  that notified this
[3486.02 --> 3487.58]  was the putting more wood
[3487.58 --> 3488.80]  behind fewer areas comment
[3488.80 --> 3489.86]  by their new CEO,
[3490.22 --> 3490.88]  new-ish CEO,
[3490.88 --> 3493.12]  and getting rid of labs
[3493.12 --> 3494.14]  and getting,
[3494.38 --> 3495.52]  potentially getting rid,
[3495.58 --> 3496.86]  rumored to be getting rid of
[3496.86 --> 3498.26]  or already gotten rid of
[3498.26 --> 3499.32]  the 20% program
[3499.32 --> 3500.46]  where employees had
[3500.46 --> 3501.20]  one day of their
[3501.20 --> 3501.98]  five-day work week
[3501.98 --> 3503.78]  to just work on side projects.
[3504.22 --> 3504.50]  Right.
[3505.04 --> 3506.20]  So side projects
[3506.20 --> 3507.66]  are not really a thing anymore.
[3507.80 --> 3508.62]  They're going to stay focused
[3508.62 --> 3509.98]  on the big biz stuff
[3509.98 --> 3511.22]  like self-driving cars
[3511.22 --> 3511.90]  or whatever else
[3511.90 --> 3512.54]  the case may be.
[3512.54 --> 3512.64]  Yeah.
[3513.50 --> 3514.24]  Put all their employees
[3514.24 --> 3514.64]  behind it
[3514.64 --> 3515.44]  and work five days a week
[3515.44 --> 3515.84]  on that
[3515.84 --> 3516.72]  and maybe
[3516.72 --> 3518.60]  not really help
[3518.60 --> 3519.22]  a lot of people
[3519.22 --> 3520.82]  like Microsoft
[3520.82 --> 3521.86]  to develop their own app.
[3522.28 --> 3522.90]  All right.
[3522.98 --> 3523.80]  So let's go into
[3523.80 --> 3524.72]  one of the topics
[3524.72 --> 3525.70]  that I really wanted
[3525.70 --> 3526.48]  to do earlier
[3526.48 --> 3527.52]  and got cut off.
[3527.60 --> 3527.84]  And I,
[3528.00 --> 3529.08]  I really don't think
[3529.08 --> 3529.64]  you guys are even
[3529.64 --> 3529.96]  going to be able
[3529.96 --> 3530.56]  to read this.
[3530.82 --> 3531.54]  I'm just going to like
[3531.54 --> 3532.52]  blow this up
[3532.52 --> 3534.26]  as big as possible here.
[3534.58 --> 3535.84]  So this is
[3535.84 --> 3537.12]  the double-edged sword
[3537.12 --> 3538.82]  that is using social media
[3538.82 --> 3539.70]  to communicate
[3539.70 --> 3541.56]  with your customers.
[3542.52 --> 3542.92]  So,
[3543.18 --> 3545.36]  Bruna Payne tweets
[3545.36 --> 3547.02]  at United Airlines.
[3547.86 --> 3549.34]  Note the misspelling there.
[3550.18 --> 3551.62]  The United Airlines staff
[3551.62 --> 3552.60]  at Gate C8
[3552.60 --> 3553.54]  in the airport,
[3553.66 --> 3554.38]  whatever that is,
[3554.46 --> 3556.02]  are a complete disrespect.
[3556.66 --> 3557.60]  Hashtag news.
[3558.06 --> 3559.08]  That just goes along
[3559.08 --> 3559.66]  so well
[3559.66 --> 3561.06]  with this profile picture
[3561.06 --> 3561.54]  right here.
[3561.94 --> 3564.16]  They are a complete disrespect.
[3564.94 --> 3565.86]  So let's go ahead
[3565.86 --> 3566.58]  and move down.
[3566.68 --> 3568.14]  United Airlines says,
[3568.28 --> 3569.14]  count your blessings.
[3569.28 --> 3570.02]  At JFK,
[3570.10 --> 3570.92]  they throw knives.
[3571.92 --> 3573.58]  To which Bruna replies,
[3573.66 --> 3574.24]  is that supposed
[3574.24 --> 3574.92]  to be funny?
[3575.36 --> 3576.82]  At JetBlue for one
[3576.82 --> 3577.54]  takes tweets
[3577.54 --> 3578.64]  regarding their company
[3578.64 --> 3579.28]  Sirius.
[3579.42 --> 3580.10]  Might want to take
[3580.10 --> 3580.72]  some tips.
[3581.30 --> 3581.96]  No, it's a very
[3581.96 --> 3582.72]  serious warning.
[3582.84 --> 3583.88]  We accidentally hired
[3583.88 --> 3584.52]  bounty hunters
[3584.52 --> 3585.50]  to run that desk
[3585.50 --> 3586.30]  and now we can't
[3586.30 --> 3586.80]  stop them.
[3588.38 --> 3589.32]  Michael tweets,
[3589.40 --> 3590.14]  for those following,
[3590.26 --> 3590.96]  I'm still stuck
[3590.96 --> 3591.56]  at Buffalo
[3591.56 --> 3593.08]  at United Airlines.
[3593.30 --> 3593.92]  Thanks for trying
[3593.92 --> 3594.56]  to fight the weather.
[3594.64 --> 3595.30]  You're doing well.
[3595.68 --> 3596.58]  Here at United Airlines,
[3596.80 --> 3597.74]  we strive to not let
[3597.74 --> 3598.20]  a little thing
[3598.20 --> 3599.26]  like the fury of God
[3599.26 --> 3599.96]  prevent us from
[3599.96 --> 3601.64]  delivering tolerable service.
[3601.64 --> 3603.94]  Yes, they're horrible
[3603.94 --> 3604.86]  in my experience
[3604.86 --> 3605.86]  and I avoid them
[3605.86 --> 3606.42]  if possible.
[3606.42 --> 3607.34]  In our defense,
[3607.46 --> 3608.34]  it says on our website
[3608.34 --> 3609.16]  that we do not carry
[3609.16 --> 3609.78]  the equipment on
[3609.78 --> 3610.42]  domestic flights
[3610.42 --> 3611.42]  to cater to nerds.
[3612.42 --> 3612.96]  Shout out for
[3612.96 --> 3613.82]  stranding my wife
[3613.82 --> 3615.14]  at YWG for nearly
[3615.14 --> 3616.28]  12 hours for a short
[3616.28 --> 3617.00]  flight to Chicago.
[3617.16 --> 3617.68]  Excellent service.
[3617.78 --> 3618.78]  After the first six hours,
[3618.86 --> 3619.36]  she technically
[3619.36 --> 3620.28]  belonged to us.
[3620.60 --> 3621.20]  You're just lucky
[3621.20 --> 3622.02]  we met our monthly
[3622.02 --> 3622.50]  quota.
[3624.08 --> 3625.22]  So this is amazing.
[3625.36 --> 3626.88]  So this is just
[3626.88 --> 3628.32]  a completely fake
[3628.32 --> 3629.62]  parody airline account.
[3631.24 --> 3633.38]  So this guy
[3633.38 --> 3634.62]  found out that
[3634.62 --> 3635.52]  for months
[3635.52 --> 3636.40]  angry customers
[3636.40 --> 3637.60]  had been tweeting it
[3637.60 --> 3638.82]  and says,
[3638.94 --> 3639.66]  God has given me
[3639.66 --> 3640.94]  a great beautiful funnel
[3640.94 --> 3642.14]  through which angry people
[3642.14 --> 3643.12]  flow in the worst
[3643.12 --> 3644.00]  possible mood.
[3644.36 --> 3645.56]  This is comedy gold.
[3646.12 --> 3648.22]  I absolutely loved it.
[3649.68 --> 3653.04]  What is the recourse
[3653.04 --> 3654.52]  for someone like
[3654.52 --> 3655.22]  United Airlines?
[3655.22 --> 3656.44]  How do they prevent
[3656.44 --> 3657.70]  this from happening?
[3658.14 --> 3659.18]  You have to go through
[3659.18 --> 3660.34]  the very few amount
[3660.34 --> 3660.94]  of tools that are
[3660.94 --> 3662.10]  even available to you.
[3662.18 --> 3662.82]  One of which is
[3662.82 --> 3663.52]  the official
[3663.52 --> 3665.10]  little checkmark thing.
[3665.24 --> 3666.08]  But you can't even
[3666.08 --> 3666.94]  apply for that.
[3667.44 --> 3667.60]  Really?
[3667.60 --> 3668.28]  I can't even,
[3668.42 --> 3668.64]  yes,
[3669.08 --> 3670.14]  verified by Twitter
[3670.14 --> 3671.62]  is not an application
[3671.62 --> 3672.14]  process.
[3672.60 --> 3673.36]  They have to reach
[3673.36 --> 3674.04]  out to you.
[3674.24 --> 3675.90]  So I can't even apply.
[3676.36 --> 3677.06]  So if someone else
[3677.06 --> 3678.54]  made at Linus tick,
[3679.04 --> 3679.82]  for example,
[3679.96 --> 3680.42]  on Twitter,
[3680.50 --> 3681.12]  I'm sure there's going
[3681.12 --> 3681.78]  to be a dozen of them
[3681.78 --> 3681.98]  now.
[3682.34 --> 3683.36]  But if someone made
[3683.36 --> 3684.74]  at Linus tick on Twitter,
[3684.74 --> 3686.14]  there's nothing I can
[3686.14 --> 3688.04]  do to redirect people
[3688.04 --> 3688.82]  to the correct Twitter
[3688.82 --> 3689.16]  account.
[3689.26 --> 3689.98]  You use your same
[3689.98 --> 3690.42]  photo,
[3690.76 --> 3691.42]  same background.
[3691.86 --> 3692.66]  It's way too easy.
[3692.92 --> 3693.80]  It's way too easy.
[3697.58 --> 3699.02]  I find it hilarious,
[3699.24 --> 3700.14]  but it's also worrisome
[3700.14 --> 3700.82]  at the same time
[3700.82 --> 3701.48]  now that you brought
[3701.48 --> 3702.42]  up the possibility
[3702.42 --> 3703.20]  of Linus tick.
[3703.70 --> 3703.94]  Yep.
[3704.80 --> 3705.30]  So I mean,
[3705.38 --> 3705.78]  this is,
[3705.92 --> 3706.52]  and I mean,
[3706.62 --> 3707.46]  I think this is
[3707.46 --> 3708.36]  something that
[3708.36 --> 3708.88]  everyone needs
[3708.88 --> 3709.38]  to be aware of.
[3709.42 --> 3709.58]  I mean,
[3709.64 --> 3710.34]  I wish Twitter
[3710.34 --> 3711.66]  would take account
[3711.66 --> 3712.74]  takedowns more seriously.
[3712.74 --> 3713.74]  It is extreme.
[3713.86 --> 3715.06]  Like I tried to,
[3715.16 --> 3715.70]  um,
[3716.12 --> 3717.60]  I tried to take over
[3717.60 --> 3719.38]  at Linus tech tips
[3719.38 --> 3720.70]  or at Linus Sebastian
[3720.70 --> 3721.74]  or something like that,
[3721.74 --> 3723.56]  where it was an obvious,
[3723.56 --> 3724.42]  uh,
[3724.42 --> 3725.50]  Twitter accounts water.
[3726.18 --> 3727.84]  And they basically said,
[3727.98 --> 3728.72]  no,
[3729.14 --> 3729.84]  no,
[3729.92 --> 3730.78]  nothing we can do.
[3730.88 --> 3732.60]  So I don't even know
[3732.60 --> 3733.48]  what United Airlines
[3733.48 --> 3734.42]  is recourse would be
[3734.42 --> 3735.08]  because I mean,
[3735.10 --> 3735.84]  they're obviously
[3735.84 --> 3736.58]  the United Airlines
[3736.58 --> 3737.54]  and they're kind
[3737.54 --> 3738.16]  of a big deal.
[3738.16 --> 3739.12]  so there might be
[3739.12 --> 3739.76]  something they can do
[3739.76 --> 3740.04]  about it,
[3740.08 --> 3740.72]  but it's not in
[3740.72 --> 3742.14]  Twitter's terms of service
[3742.14 --> 3743.46]  to deal with something
[3743.46 --> 3744.02]  like that.
[3744.10 --> 3744.28]  Uh,
[3744.28 --> 3744.94]  so I think Twitter
[3744.94 --> 3745.70]  needs to be aware
[3745.70 --> 3746.10]  of this.
[3746.34 --> 3747.26]  I think companies
[3747.26 --> 3748.00]  need to be aware
[3748.00 --> 3748.80]  of this and almost
[3748.80 --> 3749.82]  need to keep an eye
[3749.82 --> 3750.76]  out proactively
[3750.76 --> 3751.96]  for companies
[3751.96 --> 3753.24]  that are impersonating
[3753.24 --> 3753.50]  them.
[3753.58 --> 3754.72]  And I think customers
[3754.72 --> 3755.50]  need to be aware
[3755.50 --> 3756.18]  of this because
[3756.18 --> 3757.44]  just because you're
[3757.44 --> 3758.38]  tweeting someone
[3758.38 --> 3760.00]  who might look
[3760.00 --> 3760.84]  like they represent
[3760.84 --> 3761.44]  the company
[3761.44 --> 3762.94]  that mistreated you
[3762.94 --> 3764.38]  or didn't mistreat
[3764.38 --> 3765.10]  you or whatever
[3765.10 --> 3766.42]  happened,
[3766.42 --> 3768.56]  that doesn't mean
[3768.56 --> 3769.34]  that that's what's
[3769.34 --> 3769.84]  going on.
[3770.02 --> 3770.18]  Nope.
[3771.16 --> 3771.94]  And there's a
[3771.94 --> 3772.42]  Linus twit.
[3773.02 --> 3773.48]  There's a lot.
[3773.92 --> 3774.58]  At Linus twit.
[3774.64 --> 3774.82]  Oh,
[3774.90 --> 3775.38]  that doesn't even
[3775.38 --> 3775.80]  look new.
[3776.26 --> 3776.50]  No,
[3776.66 --> 3777.34]  I don't think it is
[3777.34 --> 3777.64]  actually.
[3777.78 --> 3778.34]  At Linus twit,
[3778.40 --> 3778.98]  it's like Korean
[3778.98 --> 3779.46]  or something.
[3780.12 --> 3780.48]  Awesome.
[3780.98 --> 3781.30]  Um,
[3781.38 --> 3781.84]  but yeah,
[3781.92 --> 3782.12]  like,
[3782.36 --> 3783.22]  there's not a lot
[3783.22 --> 3783.66]  they can do.
[3783.72 --> 3783.94]  And even,
[3784.06 --> 3784.22]  okay,
[3784.28 --> 3784.74]  if they get the
[3784.74 --> 3785.40]  account closed,
[3785.48 --> 3785.82]  look how much
[3785.82 --> 3786.36]  damage has been
[3786.36 --> 3786.80]  done already.
[3787.72 --> 3788.58]  And then there's
[3788.58 --> 3789.28]  probably going to
[3789.28 --> 3789.66]  be more.
[3790.52 --> 3791.22]  I don't know.
[3791.42 --> 3792.14]  Were we actually
[3792.14 --> 3792.94]  online when we
[3792.94 --> 3793.50]  talked about the
[3793.50 --> 3794.34]  Call of Duty Ghosts
[3794.34 --> 3794.54]  trailer?
[3794.86 --> 3796.26]  I have no idea.
[3796.42 --> 3796.98]  I don't know
[3796.98 --> 3797.62]  anymore either.
[3797.94 --> 3799.12]  I think we were.
[3800.44 --> 3801.06]  All right,
[3801.12 --> 3801.60]  so I'm going to
[3801.60 --> 3802.40]  load up this other
[3802.40 --> 3803.10]  article here.
[3803.18 --> 3804.10]  This is pretty crazy.
[3804.36 --> 3805.28]  So this is like
[3805.28 --> 3807.18]  crazy as balls.
[3807.84 --> 3809.30]  A high-end flip phone?
[3812.10 --> 3812.92]  Go ahead.
[3813.22 --> 3814.18]  So this was posted
[3814.18 --> 3815.26]  by NoTreble on the
[3815.26 --> 3815.52]  forum,
[3815.62 --> 3816.40]  the original sources
[3816.40 --> 3817.00]  and gadget.
[3818.08 --> 3819.54]  Let me find my
[3819.54 --> 3820.54]  notes real quick.
[3820.68 --> 3822.08]  So it features
[3822.08 --> 3823.96]  a microSD slot,
[3823.96 --> 3825.18]  two SIM cards,
[3825.34 --> 3825.82]  which is cool.
[3825.82 --> 3826.66]  Maybe it's going
[3826.66 --> 3827.68]  to be destined
[3827.68 --> 3828.26]  for China,
[3828.42 --> 3829.46]  or maybe it'll
[3829.46 --> 3830.18]  be somewhere else
[3830.18 --> 3830.66]  entirely.
[3831.50 --> 3833.34]  It's Android 4.1
[3833.34 --> 3834.84]  bound on a
[3834.84 --> 3835.84]  1.2 gigahertz
[3835.84 --> 3836.66]  quad-core CPU,
[3837.00 --> 3837.74]  and the outer
[3837.74 --> 3838.66]  screen has three
[3838.66 --> 3839.34]  touchscreen buttons
[3839.34 --> 3839.66]  on it.
[3839.78 --> 3841.46]  It's a flip phone.
[3841.92 --> 3842.72]  Even the article
[3842.72 --> 3843.56]  that he links,
[3844.04 --> 3844.84]  or his article,
[3844.94 --> 3845.18]  I think,
[3845.26 --> 3845.50]  actually,
[3845.60 --> 3846.22]  not even the
[3846.22 --> 3846.68]  article that he
[3846.68 --> 3846.98]  links.
[3847.46 --> 3847.60]  Yeah,
[3847.68 --> 3847.82]  no,
[3847.94 --> 3849.68]  his post is
[3849.68 --> 3850.24]  asking,
[3850.42 --> 3851.66]  is this regression
[3851.66 --> 3852.86]  or progression?
[3853.48 --> 3853.66]  Like,
[3853.68 --> 3854.04]  are we going
[3854.04 --> 3854.46]  backwards?
[3854.46 --> 3855.26]  Are we going
[3855.26 --> 3855.64]  forwards?
[3855.86 --> 3856.08]  Like,
[3856.12 --> 3856.70]  it's not very
[3856.70 --> 3857.46]  clear on this
[3857.46 --> 3857.68]  one.
[3858.28 --> 3858.64]  All right.
[3859.30 --> 3859.74]  Okay,
[3859.84 --> 3860.26]  so hold on.
[3860.90 --> 3863.42]  So two 3.3-inch
[3863.42 --> 3864.90]  320x480 touch
[3864.90 --> 3865.36]  displays,
[3865.50 --> 3865.98]  which is actually
[3865.98 --> 3866.54]  not a bad
[3866.54 --> 3867.22]  pixel density.
[3867.48 --> 3867.64]  Nope.
[3867.80 --> 3868.52]  And so there's
[3868.52 --> 3869.14]  one when it's
[3869.14 --> 3869.64]  closed,
[3869.90 --> 3870.64]  which is kind
[3870.64 --> 3871.22]  of weird for a
[3871.22 --> 3871.64]  flip phone,
[3871.94 --> 3872.44]  and then there's
[3872.44 --> 3873.00]  one when it's
[3873.00 --> 3873.46]  open,
[3873.58 --> 3873.90]  so you have
[3873.90 --> 3874.40]  access to the
[3874.40 --> 3874.96]  full keyboard.
[3876.14 --> 3877.10]  Five megapixel
[3877.10 --> 3877.76]  rear camera,
[3877.90 --> 3878.32]  so it's not
[3878.32 --> 3878.62]  great,
[3878.70 --> 3879.38]  but not terrible.
[3879.56 --> 3880.04]  It's certainly
[3880.04 --> 3881.12]  not 14 megapixel.
[3881.12 --> 3881.32]  Okay,
[3881.38 --> 3881.76]  so it's not
[3881.76 --> 3882.28]  a high-end
[3882.28 --> 3882.60]  phone,
[3882.76 --> 3883.28]  but it's
[3883.28 --> 3883.92]  certainly much
[3883.92 --> 3884.40]  higher-end
[3884.40 --> 3884.72]  than other
[3884.72 --> 3885.14]  flip phones.
[3885.36 --> 3885.52]  Now,
[3885.58 --> 3885.88]  I'm going
[3885.88 --> 3886.30]  to be honest
[3886.30 --> 3886.96]  with you guys.
[3887.16 --> 3887.98]  I can probably
[3887.98 --> 3889.12]  type as quickly
[3889.12 --> 3890.46]  on a number
[3890.46 --> 3890.84]  pad,
[3891.00 --> 3891.62]  like a tactile
[3891.62 --> 3892.30]  number pad,
[3892.36 --> 3892.90]  as I can
[3892.90 --> 3893.44]  on a touchscreen
[3893.44 --> 3894.02]  keyboard.
[3895.90 --> 3896.72]  Predictive text
[3896.72 --> 3897.82]  got a lot
[3897.82 --> 3898.74]  better after
[3898.74 --> 3899.28]  the initial
[3899.28 --> 3900.10]  sort of like,
[3900.60 --> 3900.92]  okay,
[3900.98 --> 3901.08]  well,
[3901.10 --> 3901.52]  I pressed it
[3901.52 --> 3902.14]  three times
[3902.14 --> 3902.68]  for O
[3902.68 --> 3903.54]  and two times
[3903.54 --> 3903.96]  for L.
[3903.96 --> 3904.72]  I can't
[3904.72 --> 3904.94]  remember what
[3904.94 --> 3905.40]  it's called,
[3905.54 --> 3905.84]  but there's
[3905.84 --> 3906.46]  that one
[3906.46 --> 3908.00]  predictive text
[3908.00 --> 3908.62]  algorithm that
[3908.62 --> 3909.00]  everyone started
[3909.00 --> 3909.46]  using right
[3909.46 --> 3909.98]  before smartphones
[3909.98 --> 3910.36]  came out.
[3910.42 --> 3910.86]  Q9,
[3910.94 --> 3911.28]  T9,
[3911.36 --> 3911.86]  T9.
[3912.00 --> 3912.08]  Yeah,
[3912.14 --> 3912.38]  T9.
[3912.40 --> 3913.82]  It's pretty
[3913.82 --> 3914.50]  darn good.
[3914.74 --> 3915.66]  It's pretty
[3915.66 --> 3916.20]  fast.
[3917.24 --> 3917.32]  And,
[3917.38 --> 3919.82]  I mean,
[3919.88 --> 3920.28]  there's something
[3920.28 --> 3920.92]  to be said
[3920.92 --> 3921.46]  for tactile
[3921.46 --> 3921.88]  buttons,
[3922.00 --> 3922.40]  particularly
[3922.40 --> 3923.20]  old people.
[3923.80 --> 3924.30]  My dad,
[3924.68 --> 3925.68]  no interest
[3925.68 --> 3926.24]  in a smartphone.
[3926.66 --> 3927.68]  No interest.
[3927.92 --> 3928.46]  And when his
[3928.46 --> 3928.90]  phone dies,
[3928.96 --> 3929.24]  he's going to
[3929.24 --> 3929.58]  have to buy
[3929.58 --> 3930.04]  something.
[3930.26 --> 3930.60]  So what
[3930.60 --> 3931.04]  does he buy?
[3931.68 --> 3932.28]  So there
[3932.28 --> 3932.64]  you go,
[3932.72 --> 3933.46]  the Hennessy.
[3933.96 --> 3934.76]  Quad core
[3934.76 --> 3935.26]  CPU,
[3936.04 --> 3936.66]  Wi-Fi,
[3936.78 --> 3937.06]  Bluetooth,
[3937.26 --> 3937.60]  GPS,
[3937.82 --> 3938.14]  all that
[3938.14 --> 3938.58]  stuff that
[3938.58 --> 3939.24]  you'd expect.
[3940.98 --> 3942.30]  My most
[3942.30 --> 3942.70]  interesting
[3942.70 --> 3943.34]  question is
[3943.34 --> 3943.78]  the exact
[3943.78 --> 3944.24]  same question
[3944.24 --> 3944.60]  as the guy
[3944.60 --> 3944.92]  that posted
[3944.92 --> 3945.26]  on our
[3945.26 --> 3945.52]  forum.
[3945.92 --> 3946.70]  Is this
[3946.70 --> 3947.52]  really going
[3947.52 --> 3948.08]  forwards?
[3949.60 --> 3950.88]  Or did
[3950.88 --> 3951.48]  Samsung just
[3951.48 --> 3951.70]  go,
[3951.78 --> 3952.18]  ehhh?
[3953.12 --> 3953.44]  You know
[3953.44 --> 3953.66]  what,
[3953.72 --> 3953.90]  though?
[3954.10 --> 3954.66]  When we
[3954.66 --> 3955.02]  were over
[3955.02 --> 3955.60]  in Taiwan,
[3956.12 --> 3956.52]  what did
[3956.52 --> 3957.00]  you notice?
[3957.82 --> 3958.64]  Everyone uses
[3958.64 --> 3959.04]  a flip.
[3959.20 --> 3959.70]  Everyone uses
[3959.70 --> 3960.04]  a flip on
[3960.04 --> 3960.34]  this very
[3960.34 --> 3960.64]  good point.
[3960.70 --> 3961.06]  And maybe
[3961.06 --> 3961.42]  it's a
[3961.42 --> 3962.04]  cost thing,
[3962.18 --> 3962.50]  maybe it's
[3962.50 --> 3962.62]  not.
[3962.72 --> 3962.88]  I mean,
[3962.88 --> 3963.32]  maybe the
[3963.32 --> 3963.72]  positioning
[3963.72 --> 3964.40]  here is
[3964.40 --> 3965.30]  premium flip.
[3965.58 --> 3966.10]  Is this
[3966.10 --> 3966.90]  baby's first
[3966.90 --> 3967.44]  smartphone,
[3967.68 --> 3968.24]  so to speak?
[3968.66 --> 3969.02]  Right.
[3969.52 --> 3969.80]  Right.
[3970.08 --> 3971.14]  That actually
[3971.14 --> 3971.56]  kind of makes
[3971.56 --> 3971.74]  a list.
[3971.76 --> 3972.04]  As a
[3972.04 --> 3972.56]  transitional
[3972.56 --> 3973.10]  device.
[3973.34 --> 3973.68]  This might
[3973.68 --> 3973.96]  be the
[3973.96 --> 3974.54]  smartest thing
[3974.54 --> 3974.86]  they've done
[3974.86 --> 3975.24]  this year.
[3975.44 --> 3975.74]  Because,
[3975.96 --> 3976.12]  oh,
[3976.18 --> 3976.34]  well,
[3976.50 --> 3978.06]  Mozilla's
[3978.06 --> 3978.42]  trying to do
[3978.42 --> 3978.88]  kind of the
[3978.88 --> 3979.36]  same thing.
[3979.84 --> 3980.62]  Very cheap,
[3980.68 --> 3981.36]  but smartphone.
[3982.38 --> 3983.24]  And you
[3983.24 --> 3983.52]  know what?
[3983.94 --> 3984.66]  Maybe this is
[3984.66 --> 3985.12]  a response to
[3985.12 --> 3985.24]  that.
[3985.32 --> 3985.76]  Maybe this is
[3985.76 --> 3986.16]  just them
[3986.16 --> 3986.68]  observing the
[3986.68 --> 3987.30]  market themselves.
[3987.50 --> 3988.20]  It's not a
[3988.20 --> 3988.80]  terrible idea.
[3988.80 --> 3989.22]  It's just
[3989.22 --> 3989.68]  kind of
[3989.68 --> 3989.96]  weird.
[3990.60 --> 3991.22]  It's very
[3991.22 --> 3991.52]  weird.
[3992.10 --> 3992.72]  I like it.
[3992.98 --> 3993.48]  I do too.
[3993.68 --> 3994.40]  I've changed
[3994.40 --> 3995.30]  my mind since
[3995.30 --> 3995.82]  we started
[3995.82 --> 3996.48]  talking about
[3996.48 --> 3996.82]  this.
[3997.00 --> 3997.24]  It's,
[3997.60 --> 3998.48]  I still
[3998.48 --> 3998.76]  don't know
[3998.76 --> 3998.94]  if,
[3999.94 --> 4000.32]  see,
[4000.42 --> 4000.74]  a big part
[4000.74 --> 4000.88]  of the
[4000.88 --> 4001.18]  problem is
[4001.18 --> 4001.44]  that word
[4001.44 --> 4001.66]  North
[4001.66 --> 4001.96]  America.
[4002.50 --> 4002.82]  Yes.
[4003.18 --> 4003.66]  I think
[4003.66 --> 4004.08]  it'll do
[4004.08 --> 4004.44]  a lot
[4004.44 --> 4004.78]  better
[4004.78 --> 4005.28]  kind of
[4005.28 --> 4006.14]  everywhere
[4006.14 --> 4006.52]  else.
[4006.64 --> 4006.82]  Yeah,
[4006.88 --> 4007.20]  I mean,
[4007.82 --> 4008.30]  here the
[4008.30 --> 4008.74]  expectation
[4008.74 --> 4009.52]  is for,
[4009.64 --> 4009.96]  you know,
[4010.24 --> 4010.68]  a couple
[4010.68 --> 4011.48]  hundred bucks
[4011.48 --> 4012.56]  so I can
[4012.56 --> 4013.04]  save up,
[4013.10 --> 4013.28]  you know,
[4013.32 --> 4013.86]  my month
[4013.86 --> 4014.18]  of,
[4014.18 --> 4014.70]  you know,
[4014.80 --> 4015.52]  spared money
[4015.52 --> 4016.10]  this month
[4016.10 --> 4016.62]  and I can
[4016.62 --> 4017.18]  get a phone
[4017.18 --> 4017.78]  on contract
[4017.78 --> 4018.54]  that's top
[4018.54 --> 4018.76]  of the
[4018.76 --> 4019.36]  freaking line.
[4019.66 --> 4020.02]  Not even
[4020.02 --> 4020.44]  sometimes,
[4020.50 --> 4020.90]  sometimes you
[4020.90 --> 4021.20]  can get top
[4021.20 --> 4021.40]  of line
[4021.40 --> 4021.76]  phones for
[4021.76 --> 4022.54]  zero dollars.
[4023.08 --> 4023.66]  Whereas you
[4023.66 --> 4024.12]  look at other
[4024.12 --> 4024.64]  markets,
[4024.88 --> 4025.76]  like South
[4025.76 --> 4026.38]  America is a
[4026.38 --> 4027.02]  great example
[4027.02 --> 4027.92]  where they'll
[4027.92 --> 4028.46]  look at something
[4028.46 --> 4028.86]  like,
[4028.94 --> 4029.18]  you know,
[4029.24 --> 4030.22]  an iPhone 5
[4030.22 --> 4030.78]  and just be
[4030.78 --> 4030.94]  like,
[4031.04 --> 4031.72]  oh my gosh,
[4031.78 --> 4032.18]  do you have
[4032.18 --> 4032.92]  any idea how
[4032.92 --> 4033.22]  much that,
[4033.26 --> 4033.74]  not only do
[4033.74 --> 4034.02]  they make
[4034.02 --> 4034.56]  less money,
[4035.06 --> 4036.06]  but because of
[4036.06 --> 4036.48]  the import
[4036.48 --> 4037.34]  taxes and all
[4037.34 --> 4038.08]  of the tariffs
[4038.08 --> 4038.88]  that exist down
[4038.88 --> 4039.12]  there,
[4039.38 --> 4039.96]  you're paying
[4039.96 --> 4041.00]  well over a
[4041.00 --> 4041.80]  thousand dollars
[4041.80 --> 4042.52]  up front
[4042.52 --> 4043.92]  for a flagship.
[4043.92 --> 4044.08]  And then there's
[4044.08 --> 4044.62]  a contract,
[4044.62 --> 4045.36]  and then there's
[4045.36 --> 4045.52]  blah,
[4045.60 --> 4045.64]  blah,
[4045.64 --> 4045.74]  blah,
[4045.74 --> 4045.86]  blah,
[4045.86 --> 4046.00]  blah,
[4046.00 --> 4046.30]  and you have
[4046.30 --> 4046.58]  to pay so
[4046.58 --> 4046.98]  much more
[4046.98 --> 4047.38]  because you're
[4047.38 --> 4047.84]  paying for the
[4047.84 --> 4048.46]  extra features.
[4048.74 --> 4049.40]  So the used
[4049.40 --> 4050.00]  phone market
[4050.00 --> 4051.10]  there is huge.
[4051.36 --> 4051.58]  Yeah.
[4052.02 --> 4052.86]  And then something
[4052.86 --> 4054.00]  like this could be
[4054.00 --> 4055.22]  potentially a big
[4055.22 --> 4055.68]  deal there.
[4055.88 --> 4056.08]  Yeah.
[4056.56 --> 4057.16]  That's interesting.
[4058.16 --> 4059.02]  Something to jump
[4059.02 --> 4059.92]  into which isn't
[4059.92 --> 4061.02]  necessarily directly
[4061.02 --> 4062.06]  related at all,
[4062.32 --> 4063.06]  but I did want to
[4063.06 --> 4063.70]  talk about is
[4063.70 --> 4064.50]  Geese Squad stealing
[4064.50 --> 4065.80]  naked photos again
[4065.80 --> 4066.76]  and leaking them
[4066.76 --> 4067.84]  online again.
[4068.58 --> 4069.24]  All right.
[4069.34 --> 4069.86]  Do we get to see
[4069.86 --> 4070.80]  the naked photos here?
[4071.34 --> 4072.60]  I kind of hope not.
[4072.88 --> 4073.52]  Yeah, me too.
[4073.52 --> 4075.00]  Are they of
[4075.00 --> 4075.62]  Geese Squad
[4075.62 --> 4076.22]  technicians?
[4076.48 --> 4076.64]  No.
[4076.64 --> 4077.80]  Because then I...
[4077.80 --> 4078.56]  Geese Squad
[4078.56 --> 4079.52]  should do a
[4079.52 --> 4080.26]  calendar.
[4080.78 --> 4081.76]  A sexy calendar.
[4082.24 --> 4082.50]  That would
[4082.50 --> 4083.04]  actually probably
[4083.04 --> 4083.54]  do pretty well.
[4083.54 --> 4083.82]  That would be
[4083.82 --> 4084.84]  a great PR stunt.
[4085.04 --> 4085.76]  That's really
[4085.76 --> 4086.58]  not a bad idea.
[4087.72 --> 4088.82]  Linus Media Group
[4088.82 --> 4089.80]  should do a sexy
[4089.80 --> 4090.18]  calendar.
[4090.52 --> 4090.98]  Oh my God.
[4091.10 --> 4091.48]  It would just
[4091.48 --> 4092.16]  be all you.
[4095.26 --> 4096.40]  Just a motherboard.
[4096.92 --> 4097.28]  Yeah.
[4097.28 --> 4099.32]  Wearing nothing
[4099.32 --> 4100.54]  but an Oculus Rift.
[4105.54 --> 4106.54]  Oh no.
[4106.94 --> 4108.38]  Of all the terrible
[4108.38 --> 4109.14]  things that they
[4109.14 --> 4109.70]  could have come up
[4109.70 --> 4110.30]  with right now.
[4110.50 --> 4111.90]  So let's go back
[4111.90 --> 4112.66]  to that actual thing.
[4112.68 --> 4114.44]  Okay, so they...
[4114.44 --> 4115.20]  Allegedly.
[4115.46 --> 4116.18]  Let's just throw that
[4116.18 --> 4116.52]  out there.
[4116.66 --> 4116.98]  Allegedly.
[4117.08 --> 4117.64]  Although they have
[4117.64 --> 4119.08]  been hit with this
[4119.08 --> 4119.42]  before.
[4119.62 --> 4120.22]  Yeah, allegedly.
[4120.60 --> 4121.62]  We're not saying
[4121.62 --> 4122.44]  anything is for sure.
[4122.44 --> 4122.88]  Yeah.
[4123.30 --> 4126.30]  So this lady had
[4126.30 --> 4126.98]  her nude photos
[4126.98 --> 4128.98]  posted online and
[4128.98 --> 4130.86]  she had never posted
[4130.86 --> 4131.24]  them online.
[4131.38 --> 4132.26]  Okay, so she says
[4132.26 --> 4133.16]  these photos were
[4133.16 --> 4134.90]  art, not selfies she
[4134.90 --> 4135.86]  snapped to send to a
[4135.86 --> 4136.06]  lover.
[4136.22 --> 4137.34]  She never posted them
[4137.34 --> 4139.04]  on any social media,
[4139.18 --> 4140.16]  explained her attorney,
[4140.60 --> 4141.36]  claiming that his
[4141.36 --> 4142.50]  client kept them only
[4142.50 --> 4143.50]  for reference or
[4143.50 --> 4144.70]  professional use for
[4144.70 --> 4145.08]  art.
[4147.68 --> 4148.16]  Hmm.
[4148.94 --> 4149.64]  The art thing is
[4149.64 --> 4150.00]  kind of weird.
[4150.08 --> 4150.58]  I don't really care
[4150.58 --> 4151.10]  about that at all.
[4151.10 --> 4152.06]  You stole someone's
[4152.06 --> 4152.90]  digital property,
[4153.12 --> 4154.98]  which was not good
[4154.98 --> 4155.16]  to see.
[4155.16 --> 4155.62]  Well, that's just
[4155.62 --> 4156.22]  what they're saying
[4156.22 --> 4157.68]  is the evidence that
[4157.68 --> 4158.72]  it was, in fact,
[4158.78 --> 4159.78]  a Best Buy employee
[4159.78 --> 4162.40]  that took the photos
[4162.40 --> 4163.56]  as opposed to her
[4163.56 --> 4164.54]  just, you know,
[4164.60 --> 4166.02]  leaking them on...
[4166.02 --> 4166.50]  Right.
[4167.64 --> 4168.04]  Okay.
[4168.44 --> 4168.88]  ...4chan.
[4169.04 --> 4169.98]  ...is because it's
[4169.98 --> 4170.32]  art.
[4170.44 --> 4171.18]  Yes, because it was
[4171.18 --> 4172.20]  art, which is exactly
[4172.20 --> 4173.08]  why she kept them
[4173.08 --> 4174.00]  for herself and never
[4174.00 --> 4174.92]  actually posted them
[4174.92 --> 4175.56]  anywhere, because
[4175.56 --> 4176.96]  one of the obvious
[4176.96 --> 4177.98]  sort of rebuttals
[4177.98 --> 4178.60]  might be, well,
[4178.62 --> 4179.32]  if you had all these
[4179.32 --> 4180.18]  naked pictures of
[4180.18 --> 4180.74]  yourself on your
[4180.74 --> 4181.56]  computer, how can we
[4181.56 --> 4181.96]  prove...
[4181.96 --> 4182.68]  How can you prove
[4182.68 --> 4183.40]  that you never
[4183.40 --> 4184.12]  sent them to anyone?
[4184.18 --> 4184.64]  Right, right.
[4184.64 --> 4185.08]  So that's the
[4185.08 --> 4185.60]  argument here.
[4185.68 --> 4186.52]  So it may or may
[4186.52 --> 4188.42]  not be true, but
[4188.42 --> 4191.74]  they have had to
[4191.74 --> 4192.88]  settle these in the
[4192.88 --> 4193.32]  past.
[4194.64 --> 4196.28]  So, yeah.
[4197.08 --> 4198.14]  I wanted to segue
[4198.14 --> 4199.34]  from this into
[4199.34 --> 4200.72]  funny stories from
[4200.72 --> 4201.72]  back when I was in
[4201.72 --> 4202.66]  grade 10 and worked
[4202.66 --> 4203.24]  at Geek Squad.
[4203.60 --> 4204.82]  Okay, let's hear it.
[4205.64 --> 4206.50]  Hit us with it.
[4206.64 --> 4208.00]  The worst of which
[4208.00 --> 4208.96]  was...
[4208.96 --> 4209.96]  Okay, I've got two
[4209.96 --> 4210.64]  really funny ones,
[4210.68 --> 4210.88]  actually.
[4211.02 --> 4211.78]  One lady had us
[4211.78 --> 4212.52]  repair her laptop,
[4212.92 --> 4213.98]  and then when she
[4213.98 --> 4214.72]  came to pick it up,
[4214.78 --> 4215.46]  she came with this
[4215.46 --> 4217.06]  super jacked dude,
[4217.44 --> 4218.20]  and the dude was
[4218.20 --> 4219.18]  way more interested...
[4219.18 --> 4219.74]  I haven't told you
[4219.74 --> 4220.14]  either of these
[4220.14 --> 4220.36]  stories.
[4220.60 --> 4221.36]  The dude was way
[4221.36 --> 4222.02]  more interested in
[4222.02 --> 4222.52]  whether or not the
[4222.52 --> 4223.64]  laptop's webcam was
[4223.64 --> 4224.60]  working and mic was
[4224.60 --> 4225.50]  working than anything
[4225.50 --> 4225.86]  else.
[4226.44 --> 4227.12]  And we were like,
[4227.80 --> 4230.30]  okay, I guess we can
[4230.30 --> 4230.76]  try it.
[4230.82 --> 4231.36]  Like, it was riddled
[4231.36 --> 4231.84]  with viruses.
[4231.98 --> 4232.74]  That's what I fixed.
[4233.08 --> 4234.52]  I wasn't trying out
[4234.52 --> 4235.02]  their webcam.
[4235.62 --> 4237.26]  So at the desk,
[4237.38 --> 4239.24]  I'm like, here, try it.
[4239.30 --> 4240.18]  So he loads up some
[4240.18 --> 4241.00]  weird-looking program,
[4241.32 --> 4241.92]  and there's like a
[4241.92 --> 4242.88]  chat box on the side,
[4242.94 --> 4243.72]  and I'm not really
[4243.72 --> 4244.26]  paying attention.
[4244.68 --> 4245.44]  And then me and my
[4245.44 --> 4246.08]  buddy are standing
[4246.08 --> 4246.84]  there with him,
[4246.90 --> 4247.96]  and he's slightly off
[4247.96 --> 4248.66]  to the side, and we're
[4248.66 --> 4249.24]  standing in front of
[4249.24 --> 4250.48]  the laptop trying to
[4250.48 --> 4251.08]  check if it works.
[4251.26 --> 4252.08]  And then all of a
[4252.08 --> 4252.98]  sudden in the chat box,
[4253.16 --> 4254.28]  I see, oh my god,
[4254.30 --> 4255.12]  you work at Best Buy?
[4256.06 --> 4256.78]  Oh, what is this?
[4256.82 --> 4257.10]  What is this?
[4257.14 --> 4257.46]  What is this?
[4257.58 --> 4258.28]  And then I read the
[4258.28 --> 4259.32]  chat box, and it's like,
[4259.74 --> 4260.66]  slur, slur, slur,
[4260.72 --> 4261.58]  slur.com.
[4261.58 --> 4262.62]  Ah.
[4263.98 --> 4266.34]  So we were on a, like,
[4266.78 --> 4267.96]  cam website, me and
[4267.96 --> 4268.30]  my buddy.
[4268.44 --> 4268.80]  Nice.
[4268.82 --> 4270.36]  When I was in grade
[4270.36 --> 4270.94]  10-ish.
[4271.14 --> 4271.60]  Did you get paid?
[4272.42 --> 4272.82]  No.
[4273.56 --> 4274.74]  Another bad one was...
[4274.74 --> 4275.64]  Oh, you were underage,
[4275.70 --> 4277.16]  so they...
[4277.16 --> 4277.46]  Guess.
[4277.68 --> 4278.52]  Oh, I didn't even
[4278.52 --> 4279.28]  think about that.
[4279.64 --> 4280.26]  Ooh, trouble.
[4280.56 --> 4281.56]  I was fully wearing
[4281.56 --> 4282.50]  clothes, but I don't
[4282.50 --> 4282.64]  know.
[4283.32 --> 4284.50]  We had converted from
[4284.50 --> 4285.68]  being in, like, a
[4285.68 --> 4287.08]  back hall to having a
[4287.08 --> 4288.24]  more open office style
[4288.24 --> 4288.86]  where people could see
[4288.86 --> 4289.62]  through the window into
[4289.62 --> 4290.32]  all the computers.
[4290.48 --> 4290.70]  Right.
[4290.70 --> 4291.74]  And so you plug in
[4291.74 --> 4292.70]  computers, and you
[4292.70 --> 4293.52]  work on them for a bit,
[4293.58 --> 4294.06]  and then you have to go
[4294.06 --> 4294.88]  help people at the desk
[4294.88 --> 4295.78]  so people can see
[4295.78 --> 4297.84]  through the window thing,
[4297.90 --> 4298.06]  right?
[4298.48 --> 4300.84]  And people have a
[4300.84 --> 4301.78]  tendency to set their
[4301.78 --> 4302.96]  screensavers to their
[4302.96 --> 4304.18]  My Pictures folder.
[4304.62 --> 4304.82]  Oh.
[4307.54 --> 4309.66]  So, so many times
[4309.66 --> 4310.34]  there would just be
[4310.34 --> 4311.28]  porn streaming in the
[4311.28 --> 4312.62]  background, and we
[4312.62 --> 4313.26]  wouldn't figure it out
[4313.26 --> 4314.02]  because there's often
[4314.02 --> 4314.86]  just one or two of us
[4314.86 --> 4315.10]  working.
[4315.22 --> 4316.18]  We'd often just both be
[4316.18 --> 4316.66]  at the desk.
[4318.10 --> 4318.46]  Oh.
[4318.46 --> 4319.92]  Maybe Shaw's calling.
[4319.92 --> 4322.08]  Okay, so I think the
[4322.08 --> 4323.56]  conclusion that we can
[4323.56 --> 4325.44]  draw here is that as
[4325.44 --> 4329.08]  much as Best Buy can
[4329.08 --> 4330.32]  have whatever policies
[4330.32 --> 4331.24]  they have in place,
[4331.38 --> 4332.44]  there's not really a
[4332.44 --> 4333.22]  whole lot they can do
[4333.22 --> 4334.46]  about deviant employees.
[4335.10 --> 4336.40]  So, you know, when
[4336.40 --> 4337.70]  people have unfettered
[4337.70 --> 4338.76]  access to other people's
[4338.76 --> 4340.74]  computers, if they're bad
[4340.74 --> 4342.12]  people, they might snoop
[4342.12 --> 4343.20]  around on the hard drive.
[4343.36 --> 4344.22]  And the other thing that
[4344.22 --> 4344.96]  there's nothing that they
[4344.96 --> 4346.46]  can do about is sheer
[4346.46 --> 4347.84]  customer stupidity.
[4348.58 --> 4350.04]  And let's face it, if
[4350.04 --> 4350.64]  you're bringing your
[4350.64 --> 4351.74]  computer to Best Buy to
[4351.74 --> 4353.58]  be fixed, you might not
[4353.58 --> 4355.24]  necessarily be the most
[4355.24 --> 4356.86]  technically apt kind of
[4356.86 --> 4357.16]  person.
[4357.42 --> 4358.78]  In fact, the article that
[4358.78 --> 4359.60]  we linked to in the
[4359.60 --> 4360.46]  livestream doc, which
[4360.46 --> 4361.82]  will be available under
[4361.82 --> 4362.74]  the video description,
[4363.30 --> 4366.54]  pointed out that, you
[4366.54 --> 4367.28]  know, well, they should
[4367.28 --> 4368.36]  have had these pictures in
[4368.36 --> 4369.78]  an encrypted folder,
[4369.96 --> 4370.88]  preferably on another
[4370.88 --> 4371.88]  drive, blah, blah, blah,
[4371.88 --> 4372.92]  etc., etc., etc.
[4373.36 --> 4377.58]  But, you know, even not
[4377.58 --> 4378.90]  you don't necessarily have
[4378.90 --> 4380.50]  to be a complete moron
[4380.50 --> 4381.12]  when it comes to
[4381.12 --> 4382.02]  computers to not know
[4382.02 --> 4383.16]  how to do that stuff.
[4383.50 --> 4385.86]  So there's a whole bunch
[4385.86 --> 4387.02]  of factors that are going
[4387.02 --> 4387.58]  on here.
[4387.82 --> 4389.04]  And I think it's a little
[4389.04 --> 4390.20]  bit more complicated
[4390.20 --> 4393.14]  necessarily than, you
[4393.14 --> 4394.10]  know, one individual's
[4394.10 --> 4394.86]  lawsuit might be.
[4395.00 --> 4396.96]  So allegedly sort of
[4396.96 --> 4398.06]  accused, blah, blah,
[4398.08 --> 4399.14]  blah, all of that stuff.
[4399.20 --> 4399.82]  We don't know what
[4399.82 --> 4401.34]  happened here, but there
[4401.34 --> 4402.36]  are certainly potential
[4402.36 --> 4403.32]  for things to happen,
[4403.40 --> 4404.32]  as Slick was saying,
[4404.56 --> 4405.72]  that are not necessarily
[4405.72 --> 4407.00]  the fault of the
[4407.00 --> 4407.46]  employees.
[4408.16 --> 4409.38]  So just kind of
[4409.38 --> 4410.76]  throwing that out there.
[4411.32 --> 4412.10]  So I would like to
[4412.10 --> 4413.02]  take this opportunity
[4413.02 --> 4414.24]  to talk a little bit
[4414.24 --> 4416.56]  about our new sponsor
[4416.56 --> 4417.48]  for the WAN show.
[4417.60 --> 4418.14]  So I'm going to go
[4418.14 --> 4419.30]  ahead and fire this up.
[4419.58 --> 4420.46]  So speaking of people
[4420.46 --> 4421.36]  who aren't necessarily
[4421.36 --> 4422.50]  the most technically
[4422.50 --> 4423.62]  inclined in the world,
[4424.02 --> 4425.66]  Squarespace.com.
[4426.12 --> 4428.56]  They are officially
[4428.56 --> 4430.38]  powering the WAN show
[4430.38 --> 4431.84]  as of, it was supposed
[4431.84 --> 4432.66]  to be last week,
[4432.72 --> 4433.34]  but we had some
[4433.34 --> 4434.22]  stream issues and
[4434.22 --> 4435.22]  we ended up sort of
[4435.22 --> 4436.52]  not being able to do
[4436.52 --> 4437.60]  our mid-roll integration
[4437.60 --> 4438.94]  for them, so we saved
[4438.94 --> 4439.74]  it until this week.
[4439.88 --> 4441.20]  But what Squarespace.com
[4441.20 --> 4441.86]  allows you to do,
[4441.92 --> 4442.54]  if you're not familiar
[4442.54 --> 4443.18]  with it already,
[4443.36 --> 4444.66]  is to create a website
[4444.66 --> 4445.84]  to display your web
[4445.84 --> 4446.98]  store photography
[4446.98 --> 4447.68]  portfolio.
[4448.06 --> 4448.82]  Although, if you
[4448.82 --> 4449.50]  want to go ahead
[4449.50 --> 4450.50]  and accuse Best Buy
[4450.50 --> 4451.62]  of, you know,
[4452.04 --> 4454.64]  letting your portfolio,
[4455.48 --> 4456.86]  letting other customers
[4456.86 --> 4457.60]  have access to your
[4457.60 --> 4458.24]  portfolio, or whatever
[4458.24 --> 4458.96]  the case may be,
[4459.02 --> 4459.72]  then I wouldn't recommend
[4459.72 --> 4460.52]  putting it on Squarespace
[4460.52 --> 4462.12]  because the idea is that
[4462.12 --> 4463.00]  it would be publicly
[4463.00 --> 4464.60]  visible, or you can
[4464.60 --> 4465.72]  create a personal blog.
[4466.04 --> 4467.22]  So basically, it's kind
[4467.22 --> 4468.30]  of like GeoCities,
[4468.50 --> 4470.40]  but updated for 2013.
[4470.82 --> 4472.62]  So the designs are not
[4472.62 --> 4473.14]  ugly.
[4473.72 --> 4475.46]  The designs have evolved
[4475.46 --> 4476.56]  in general on the web
[4476.56 --> 4477.54]  quite a bit since then,
[4477.60 --> 4478.44]  but Squarespace has
[4478.44 --> 4480.44]  over 20 customizable
[4480.44 --> 4481.78]  profiles and templates
[4481.78 --> 4482.90]  that you can go ahead
[4482.90 --> 4483.74]  and tinker around with
[4483.74 --> 4484.48]  to your heart's content.
[4484.48 --> 4485.74]  So you sign up for a
[4485.74 --> 4487.00]  free trial, which doesn't
[4487.00 --> 4488.50]  require a credit card
[4488.50 --> 4489.58]  whatsoever, and it
[4489.58 --> 4490.42]  actually gives you some
[4490.42 --> 4491.44]  suggestions depending
[4491.44 --> 4492.28]  what you want to do.
[4492.36 --> 4493.08]  So if you want to create
[4493.08 --> 4494.68]  an online store, it'll say,
[4494.78 --> 4495.52]  okay, well, these ones
[4495.52 --> 4496.76]  are pretty optimal for that.
[4496.82 --> 4497.66]  Or if you wanted to
[4497.66 --> 4498.62]  create a blog, it'll say,
[4498.68 --> 4499.32]  these ones are pretty
[4499.32 --> 4500.00]  optimal for that.
[4500.04 --> 4501.24]  And there's a ton of
[4501.24 --> 4502.40]  customization that you can
[4502.40 --> 4502.68]  do.
[4502.78 --> 4503.80]  So you can change fonts,
[4503.86 --> 4504.66]  you can change locations,
[4504.76 --> 4505.48]  you can add a bunch of
[4505.48 --> 4506.58]  navigation at the top.
[4506.92 --> 4508.26]  They've got 24-7 tech
[4508.26 --> 4510.22]  supports, and our audience
[4510.22 --> 4511.68]  will probably also like
[4511.68 --> 4512.96]  that in addition to the
[4512.96 --> 4513.98]  drag-and-drop interface
[4513.98 --> 4515.60]  that allows you to kind
[4515.60 --> 4516.62]  of go, oh, well, okay,
[4516.66 --> 4517.26]  I'm going to merchandise
[4517.26 --> 4518.26]  an item, just kind of
[4518.26 --> 4519.18]  drag-and-drop a picture
[4519.18 --> 4520.42]  in there at a price,
[4520.84 --> 4522.44]  at an on-sale price,
[4522.48 --> 4523.24]  and then it's pretty much
[4523.24 --> 4523.88]  ready to go.
[4524.04 --> 4525.30]  You can actually use
[4525.30 --> 4526.38]  the Advanced tab or
[4526.38 --> 4527.52]  the Developer Mode tab
[4527.52 --> 4528.60]  to dink around with
[4528.60 --> 4530.08]  the CSS and HTML.
[4530.50 --> 4531.88]  So it's not just for
[4531.88 --> 4532.46]  non-techies.
[4532.54 --> 4533.88]  It starts at $8 a month
[4533.88 --> 4535.40]  and includes scalable
[4535.40 --> 4537.04]  hosting if traffic turns
[4537.04 --> 4537.84]  out to be much better
[4537.84 --> 4538.48]  than you expected.
[4538.80 --> 4539.62]  And if you use offer
[4539.62 --> 4541.28]  code Linus8, you can
[4541.28 --> 4542.64]  save 10% on your first
[4542.64 --> 4543.36]  purchase with a new
[4543.36 --> 4543.70]  account.
[4544.00 --> 4544.76]  So thanks, Squarespace,
[4544.98 --> 4545.68]  for your support of
[4545.68 --> 4547.20]  The WAN Show, and we're
[4547.20 --> 4548.20]  really excited to keep
[4548.20 --> 4549.06]  working with you guys
[4549.06 --> 4551.04]  because so far, my mom's
[4551.04 --> 4552.14]  actually been trying to
[4552.14 --> 4553.24]  get a website going on
[4553.24 --> 4554.70]  it, and they've been
[4554.70 --> 4556.06]  pretty easy to use.
[4556.32 --> 4557.30]  She's actually at the
[4557.30 --> 4558.40]  cabin right now, so she
[4558.40 --> 4559.30]  hasn't worked on it in
[4559.30 --> 4561.06]  the last, I think, five
[4561.06 --> 4561.50]  days.
[4561.78 --> 4563.28]  But I am outright
[4563.28 --> 4564.46]  refusing to help her,
[4564.90 --> 4566.04]  and I'm telling her that
[4566.04 --> 4566.94]  I want her to go through
[4566.94 --> 4568.42]  Squarespace's tech support
[4568.42 --> 4569.84]  because to me, that is
[4569.84 --> 4571.10]  the ultimate acid test.
[4571.28 --> 4573.02]  If they can handle her,
[4573.46 --> 4574.54]  they can handle pretty
[4574.54 --> 4575.42]  much anything.
[4575.76 --> 4576.62]  Because her question
[4576.62 --> 4577.54]  was, because when you
[4577.54 --> 4579.12]  buy a year, they throw
[4579.12 --> 4580.76]  in a domain for free, so
[4580.76 --> 4581.76]  her question was, what
[4581.76 --> 4582.24]  is a domain?
[4582.78 --> 4583.40]  So that should give you
[4583.40 --> 4584.56]  some idea of my mom's
[4584.56 --> 4585.86]  sort of technical level
[4585.86 --> 4587.36]  when it comes to the
[4587.36 --> 4588.78]  interwebs and all of
[4588.78 --> 4590.18]  those related things.
[4590.58 --> 4591.74]  So speaking of the
[4591.74 --> 4595.30]  interwebs, Cisco, the
[4595.30 --> 4597.04]  company that powers a
[4597.04 --> 4597.76]  whole lot of the
[4597.76 --> 4600.68]  interwebs, slashed 4,000
[4600.68 --> 4603.06]  staff in spite of
[4603.06 --> 4606.12]  turning, oh boy, in
[4606.12 --> 4607.64]  spite of recording record
[4607.64 --> 4608.98]  results for the quarter.
[4609.38 --> 4610.78]  So it really sort of
[4610.78 --> 4612.10]  raises the question, what
[4612.10 --> 4613.24]  is going on over there?
[4613.30 --> 4614.40]  So they recently shed
[4614.40 --> 4615.98]  Linksys for not being
[4615.98 --> 4617.58]  profitable enough, not
[4617.58 --> 4618.50]  contributing enough to
[4618.50 --> 4619.58]  their bottom line or
[4619.58 --> 4622.70]  basically looking bad on
[4622.70 --> 4623.46]  their balance sheet.
[4623.46 --> 4626.12]  They have, wow, they
[4626.12 --> 4627.52]  slashed 4,000 jobs.
[4627.62 --> 4628.30]  I mean, think about
[4628.30 --> 4628.64]  that.
[4628.98 --> 4630.14]  You went to high school
[4630.14 --> 4632.00]  with probably anywhere
[4632.00 --> 4633.46]  from a couple hundred to
[4633.46 --> 4634.80]  500 people, depending on
[4634.80 --> 4635.52]  the size of your high
[4635.52 --> 4635.76]  school.
[4636.06 --> 4637.44]  So that's about like them
[4637.44 --> 4640.32]  slashing your entire
[4640.32 --> 4642.26]  graduating class times
[4642.26 --> 4643.36]  probably anywhere from
[4643.36 --> 4644.44]  about 8 to 20.
[4645.44 --> 4646.00]  Unbelievable.
[4646.64 --> 4647.74]  So what do they have to
[4647.74 --> 4648.46]  say about this?
[4649.42 --> 4650.90]  In the past two years, we
[4650.90 --> 4651.90]  have managed the business
[4651.90 --> 4653.10]  with discipline and focus
[4653.10 --> 4654.48]  to execute on the
[4654.48 --> 4655.68]  portfolio investments and
[4655.68 --> 4656.62]  operational efficiency
[4656.62 --> 4658.10]  opportunities that we see
[4658.10 --> 4659.34]  in fiscal year 2014.
[4659.34 --> 4660.76]  We are rebalancing our
[4660.76 --> 4662.24]  resources with a workforce
[4662.24 --> 4663.34]  reduction which will
[4663.34 --> 4665.88]  impact 5% of our global
[4665.88 --> 4666.38]  workforce.
[4666.72 --> 4668.02]  Now, as someone who runs
[4668.02 --> 4669.06]  their own business these
[4669.06 --> 4670.26]  days, I can definitely
[4670.26 --> 4672.20]  sympathize with the
[4672.20 --> 4673.90]  seemingly uncontrollable
[4673.90 --> 4675.10]  cost that is human
[4675.10 --> 4675.62]  resources.
[4675.94 --> 4677.12]  Something that a lot of
[4677.12 --> 4678.64]  people don't know is
[4678.64 --> 4680.54]  that the amount that you
[4680.54 --> 4682.04]  get on your paycheck in
[4682.04 --> 4683.68]  your bank account, so yes,
[4684.04 --> 4685.94]  Uncle Sam or, you know,
[4686.72 --> 4688.44]  Mr. Harper or whoever it
[4688.44 --> 4690.16]  is that represents your
[4690.16 --> 4692.00]  tax man in your country is
[4692.00 --> 4694.12]  definitely taking a cut, but
[4694.12 --> 4695.30]  there's also a lot of stuff
[4695.30 --> 4696.36]  that goes on behind the
[4696.36 --> 4696.64]  scenes.
[4696.96 --> 4698.72]  So let's say theoretically I
[4698.72 --> 4699.88]  had an employee at Linus
[4699.88 --> 4702.02]  Media Group that cost, that's
[4702.02 --> 4703.54]  wage was $10 an hour.
[4703.82 --> 4705.06]  I'm paying anywhere from
[4705.06 --> 4707.86]  around $12.5 to $13.5 an
[4707.86 --> 4709.58]  hour and we don't even have
[4709.58 --> 4710.74]  medical plan yet.
[4711.00 --> 4712.24]  Remember, this is Canada, so
[4712.24 --> 4713.10]  when we don't have a medical
[4713.10 --> 4714.20]  plan, that doesn't mean you're
[4714.20 --> 4715.24]  completely boned.
[4715.52 --> 4716.74]  It just means that you don't
[4716.74 --> 4718.52]  have extended medical like
[4718.52 --> 4719.42]  dental, for example.
[4719.68 --> 4720.66]  It's something we're working
[4720.66 --> 4723.56]  on, but the actual cost is
[4723.56 --> 4726.50]  double digit percentages higher
[4726.50 --> 4728.38]  than the employee even knows
[4728.38 --> 4728.68]  about.
[4729.04 --> 4730.72]  So I can definitely relate to
[4730.72 --> 4730.88]  that.
[4730.98 --> 4732.64]  But on the other hand, I
[4732.64 --> 4733.54]  take a bit of a different
[4733.54 --> 4734.74]  philosophy, I think, and
[4734.74 --> 4735.84]  hopefully Slick can back me
[4735.84 --> 4738.10]  up on this, where I feel like
[4738.10 --> 4739.14]  if Linus Media Group is
[4739.14 --> 4740.70]  doing well and we're making
[4740.70 --> 4742.78]  money, the people that got us
[4742.78 --> 4744.14]  there should be getting a
[4744.14 --> 4745.92]  reward as opposed to getting
[4745.92 --> 4747.12]  their jobs cut or getting
[4747.12 --> 4748.22]  their salaries cut.
[4748.32 --> 4748.94]  I'm assuming you're talking
[4748.94 --> 4749.34]  about Cisco.
[4749.80 --> 4750.82]  Yeah, I'm talking about the
[4750.82 --> 4751.42]  Cisco thing.
[4751.76 --> 4753.00]  I mean, I'm going to be
[4753.00 --> 4754.04]  perfectly blunt with the
[4754.04 --> 4754.72]  viewers right now.
[4754.88 --> 4756.68]  I haven't given myself a raise
[4756.68 --> 4758.06]  since we started Linus Media
[4758.06 --> 4758.42]  Group.
[4758.72 --> 4761.54]  However, I have done some
[4761.54 --> 4762.92]  raises and some bonuses.
[4763.62 --> 4764.90]  So there you go.
[4764.90 --> 4767.12]  I mean, that's not to say
[4767.12 --> 4768.46]  that, you know, I'm going to
[4768.46 --> 4769.60]  pay everyone, you know,
[4769.76 --> 4771.72]  $250,000 a year just for
[4771.72 --> 4772.54]  showing up to work.
[4772.94 --> 4773.92]  They're going to have to make
[4773.92 --> 4774.92]  sure that the stream is ready
[4774.92 --> 4776.06]  to go on time when I come
[4776.06 --> 4777.50]  back from NCIX if they want
[4777.50 --> 4778.22]  something like that to
[4778.22 --> 4778.50]  happen.
[4779.32 --> 4780.52]  I don't take full
[4780.52 --> 4781.46]  responsibility for that.
[4782.96 --> 4785.12]  And definitely our ISP
[4785.12 --> 4786.28]  issues today haven't helped.
[4786.56 --> 4788.64]  But anyway, the point is I
[4788.64 --> 4791.14]  really don't like this at all.
[4791.14 --> 4793.10]  And maybe it's a good thing
[4793.10 --> 4794.64]  that Belkin owns Linksys now
[4794.64 --> 4795.88]  because I've got some pretty
[4795.88 --> 4797.60]  good bros over at Linksys that
[4797.60 --> 4798.56]  I don't want to lose their
[4798.56 --> 4798.92]  jobs.
[4799.12 --> 4800.62]  It's like 5% of the company got
[4800.62 --> 4801.14]  dropped or something.
[4801.26 --> 4802.00]  I don't know how much you've
[4802.00 --> 4802.44]  talked about it.
[4802.46 --> 4803.80]  And with that said, if you've
[4803.80 --> 4804.98]  worked at a bigger company, you
[4804.98 --> 4806.26]  probably know that one out of
[4806.26 --> 4807.60]  every 20 people there at least
[4807.60 --> 4808.44]  is a complete idiot.
[4809.14 --> 4811.26]  So maybe that was the kind of
[4811.26 --> 4811.66]  layoffs.
[4811.86 --> 4812.62]  Maybe, but...
[4812.62 --> 4813.92]  But if you've worked at a big
[4813.92 --> 4815.00]  company that's gone through
[4815.00 --> 4816.54]  layoffs, you probably know that
[4816.54 --> 4817.74]  it's not always that way.
[4817.74 --> 4818.32]  Not always that way.
[4818.32 --> 4819.92]  And a lot of times it becomes
[4819.92 --> 4821.32]  friendships instead of actual
[4821.32 --> 4821.80]  productivity.
[4821.94 --> 4824.28]  Friendships and seniority and
[4824.28 --> 4826.76]  just goofy stuff that's not
[4826.76 --> 4828.16]  actually to do with competence.
[4828.40 --> 4829.80]  I know really good people who
[4829.80 --> 4831.38]  have gotten laid off when I
[4831.38 --> 4833.20]  know complete morons at the
[4833.20 --> 4834.40]  same company that for whatever
[4834.40 --> 4835.56]  reason still have their jobs.
[4836.66 --> 4837.06]  So...
[4837.06 --> 4839.56]  So we're not getting any help
[4839.56 --> 4840.78]  from them right now.
[4841.12 --> 4841.90]  Oh, Shaw?
[4841.92 --> 4843.04]  It'll have to be after the
[4843.04 --> 4843.24]  stream.
[4843.66 --> 4844.08]  Oh, okay.
[4845.40 --> 4846.86]  Refuse to do anything until I
[4846.86 --> 4847.60]  reset my modem.
[4847.60 --> 4848.04]  Okay.
[4848.28 --> 4849.36]  I guess that makes sense.
[4849.74 --> 4849.96]  Okay.
[4850.04 --> 4851.26]  Well, we don't really have too
[4851.26 --> 4852.12]  much left anyway.
[4852.68 --> 4854.06]  Lots of rumors about the
[4854.06 --> 4854.60]  upcoming...
[4855.32 --> 4856.72]  Whatever it is they're going
[4856.72 --> 4857.12]  to call it.
[4857.14 --> 4858.94]  Let's just call it Volcanic
[4858.94 --> 4859.48]  Islands.
[4860.20 --> 4863.30]  So AMD's new graphics cards
[4863.30 --> 4865.10]  potentially that maybe are
[4865.10 --> 4866.44]  coming and I can't find the
[4866.44 --> 4867.96]  link in the doc for it.
[4868.86 --> 4869.22]  Down.
[4869.34 --> 4869.48]  Down.
[4869.62 --> 4869.74]  Down.
[4869.74 --> 4869.76]  Down.
[4869.84 --> 4870.02]  Down.
[4870.48 --> 4871.18]  Up a little bit.
[4871.36 --> 4872.04]  Way down.
[4872.52 --> 4873.20]  A little tiny bit.
[4873.34 --> 4873.84]  There it is.
[4873.98 --> 4874.16]  Boom.
[4874.22 --> 4874.48]  All right.
[4874.50 --> 4875.58]  It's one of those stupid ones
[4875.58 --> 4876.48]  where the header is on a
[4876.48 --> 4878.08]  different line than the other
[4878.08 --> 4878.30]  thing.
[4878.90 --> 4881.30]  So potential pricing has
[4881.30 --> 4882.48]  potentially been revealed.
[4882.60 --> 4884.18]  So according to Fudzilla, this
[4884.18 --> 4885.90]  was posted by Emma Long on the
[4885.90 --> 4887.64]  Linus Tech Tips Forum, the HD
[4887.64 --> 4890.92]  9970 will cost less than $600.
[4891.92 --> 4893.38]  They speculate that it will cost
[4893.38 --> 4895.52]  between $549 and $599.
[4896.40 --> 4898.16]  That's really, really aggressive.
[4898.54 --> 4900.10]  That sounds about right for a
[4900.10 --> 4901.02]  high-end GPU launch.
[4901.20 --> 4902.40]  Yeah, but it's aggressive compared
[4902.40 --> 4903.60]  to what is on the other team.
[4903.68 --> 4904.84]  Compared to what's available now
[4904.84 --> 4907.18]  because NVIDIA just refreshed.
[4907.60 --> 4908.88]  They're not going to be launching
[4908.88 --> 4910.98]  Maxwell tomorrow.
[4911.40 --> 4911.62]  Yeah.
[4911.68 --> 4913.00]  So they're not necessarily going to
[4913.00 --> 4913.66]  have a response.
[4913.82 --> 4916.70]  AMD could have done what NVIDIA did
[4916.70 --> 4918.80]  because the rumored performance of
[4918.80 --> 4922.14]  the potentially alleged 9970 is
[4922.14 --> 4924.48]  rumored to be around 5% better than
[4924.48 --> 4924.86]  a Titan.
[4925.60 --> 4927.18]  So they could have come in at $1,000
[4927.18 --> 4930.74]  or even $899.99 and undercut Titan.
[4930.74 --> 4932.86]  But it looks like what AMD wants to
[4932.86 --> 4934.86]  do is put pressure on NVIDIA to
[4934.86 --> 4935.82]  drop the price of Titan.
[4936.80 --> 4937.42]  Which is cool.
[4937.80 --> 4938.44]  Which is great.
[4938.56 --> 4939.34]  I like a cheap Titan.
[4939.52 --> 4940.44]  Because we're going to see
[4940.44 --> 4942.14]  Never Settle Forever is now
[4942.14 --> 4942.46]  running.
[4942.86 --> 4944.36]  So you have your choice of, I think
[4944.36 --> 4945.56]  it's eight games right now.
[4945.62 --> 4947.82]  And they're pretty, pretty high-end
[4947.82 --> 4948.12]  titles.
[4948.22 --> 4950.14]  If you buy a top-tier card, you get
[4950.14 --> 4950.78]  three games.
[4951.06 --> 4953.28]  If you buy a 7800 series right now,
[4953.34 --> 4954.18]  you get two games.
[4954.40 --> 4957.14]  And if you buy a 7770 or 7790, you
[4957.14 --> 4958.72]  get one game and you get to pick
[4958.72 --> 4960.28]  whatever you want and get this.
[4960.32 --> 4961.46]  I didn't even know about this
[4961.46 --> 4962.02]  until today.
[4962.26 --> 4963.48]  But if you don't like any of the
[4963.48 --> 4964.90]  games on Never Settle Forever right
[4964.90 --> 4966.70]  now, or you already have them, you
[4966.70 --> 4968.86]  can hold on to your ticket until
[4968.86 --> 4971.54]  December 31st at least and hold
[4971.54 --> 4973.28]  out for upcoming games.
[4973.62 --> 4975.24]  For possible other games.
[4975.36 --> 4976.14]  Wow, that's cool.
[4976.36 --> 4976.64]  Yeah.
[4976.92 --> 4977.92]  That's so beast.
[4978.20 --> 4980.22]  They are really, really putting the
[4980.22 --> 4981.64]  pressure on with the new drivers,
[4981.96 --> 4983.88]  upcoming potentially alleged GPUs,
[4984.20 --> 4986.10]  and upcoming potentially alleged game
[4986.10 --> 4986.36]  titles.
[4986.62 --> 4986.74]  Yeah.
[4987.22 --> 4989.82]  Because, yeah, I mean, I've seen,
[4990.10 --> 4991.96]  I can't comment on the upcoming game
[4991.96 --> 4994.26]  titles, unfortunately, because I have
[4994.26 --> 4996.20]  seen a deck and I do know what it is.
[4996.78 --> 4998.20]  Hold on to your pants, guys.
[4999.42 --> 5001.26]  Hold on to your pants.
[5001.26 --> 5001.92]  I haven't seen this.
[5001.96 --> 5002.46]  I'm excited.
[5002.80 --> 5005.20]  So, yeah, that's incredibly exciting.
[5005.60 --> 5007.28]  Have you talked about baby monitors?
[5007.58 --> 5007.94]  No.
[5009.04 --> 5010.10]  Wow, guys.
[5010.34 --> 5012.64]  Secure your freaking Wi-Fi.
[5013.22 --> 5014.60]  Do it now.
[5015.00 --> 5019.08]  This was posted by Ion Baza on the
[5019.08 --> 5020.74]  forum, and this was an article from
[5020.74 --> 5023.04]  CNET.com, and there's more on ABC.
[5023.52 --> 5024.30]  Go, Slick.
[5024.46 --> 5027.28]  So, some guy hacked into some other
[5027.28 --> 5030.06]  guy's router, accessed their network-enabled
[5030.06 --> 5032.28]  baby monitor, and started shouting
[5032.28 --> 5032.86]  through it.
[5033.02 --> 5035.02]  They heard a voice calling his daughter
[5035.02 --> 5037.62]  an effing moron and telling her to
[5037.62 --> 5039.92]  wake up, you little thing.
[5039.92 --> 5043.20]  The hacker began shouting at her
[5043.20 --> 5044.56]  parents once they came into the room
[5044.56 --> 5045.44]  to try and figure out what was going
[5045.44 --> 5048.52]  on, called the man a stupid moron,
[5048.62 --> 5050.04]  and his wife a B-word.
[5051.14 --> 5052.20]  In front of their two-year-old
[5052.20 --> 5052.50]  daughter.
[5052.70 --> 5054.28]  And they're not even sure this hadn't
[5054.28 --> 5056.16]  happened already at least once.
[5056.68 --> 5059.02]  So, oh, man.
[5059.38 --> 5062.50]  Like, if you know anyone that uses
[5062.50 --> 5063.64]  network-enabled baby monitors,
[5064.12 --> 5064.94]  you're a tech guy.
[5065.42 --> 5066.64]  Make sure that router's secure.
[5066.64 --> 5069.70]  Yeah, we're charging you to be
[5069.70 --> 5072.14]  personally responsible for protecting
[5072.14 --> 5073.68]  your friends and family and making
[5073.68 --> 5075.00]  sure that this kind of...
[5075.00 --> 5076.80]  Because that is such a huge invasion
[5076.80 --> 5077.24]  of privacy.
[5077.48 --> 5077.96]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[5078.32 --> 5079.54]  That's just...
[5079.54 --> 5081.26]  Not only does he have access to the
[5081.26 --> 5083.50]  video, but he's able to talk to them?
[5083.70 --> 5086.56]  Like, that's not cool.
[5086.60 --> 5088.50]  Go secure your Wi-Fi right now if you
[5088.50 --> 5089.08]  haven't done it.
[5089.32 --> 5091.74]  Moving into our next topic, Xbox One
[5091.74 --> 5094.30]  claims it can do 4K gaming.
[5094.30 --> 5096.30]  So this was posted on the forum by
[5096.30 --> 5097.48]  TheBloodyToxic.
[5097.80 --> 5098.74]  Here we go.
[5100.38 --> 5101.14]  I just...
[5101.14 --> 5102.30]  I wonder, like...
[5102.90 --> 5104.92]  The amount of hardware it takes to run
[5104.92 --> 5106.42]  4K well on a computer.
[5106.98 --> 5109.66]  Like, what frame rates is this running at?
[5109.68 --> 5110.34]  Here's the quote.
[5110.88 --> 5113.16]  There's no hardware restriction there at all.
[5113.46 --> 5115.54]  So in theory, the Xbox One could support
[5115.54 --> 5118.08]  2K or perhaps even 4K gaming
[5118.08 --> 5119.82]  if there's content for it at those
[5119.82 --> 5120.34]  resolutions.
[5120.34 --> 5124.12]  The source is Forbes, and I think the
[5124.12 --> 5127.42]  original poster of this link on our
[5127.42 --> 5128.94]  forum has some pretty good points here.
[5131.34 --> 5133.86]  I have two main reasons why this is just
[5133.86 --> 5137.06]  stupid and why it's basically just a lie.
[5137.32 --> 5139.38]  This is quoting the Bloody Toxic.
[5139.74 --> 5143.02]  One, two dual titans in 4K barely are able
[5143.02 --> 5145.36]  to throw 60 FPS at a screen with medium
[5145.36 --> 5146.94]  settings on modern games.
[5147.02 --> 5148.40]  We're not even talking next-gen games.
[5148.40 --> 5152.40]  Number two, the Xbox One has one 1.4
[5152.40 --> 5155.64]  HDMI output, which means 4K is going to be
[5155.64 --> 5156.72]  at 30 Hz.
[5157.10 --> 5159.56]  However, I think the first one is probably
[5159.56 --> 5161.26]  the most valid because there was no way
[5161.26 --> 5163.12]  you were going to be pushing more than 30 FPS
[5163.12 --> 5164.52]  anyway.
[5166.18 --> 5166.86]  So...
[5166.86 --> 5168.28]  Yeah.
[5168.48 --> 5171.28]  I mean, they've had a pretty good run
[5171.28 --> 5172.58]  of good press going lately.
[5172.72 --> 5174.22]  And the Kinect thing, I don't know if you've
[5174.22 --> 5174.56]  talked about that.
[5174.56 --> 5175.60]  We haven't talked about that yet.
[5175.60 --> 5179.60]  So Kinect is no longer required to run.
[5179.60 --> 5180.60]  Which is really good!
[5180.60 --> 5181.60]  Like, good job!
[5181.60 --> 5182.84]  And then you do this.
[5182.84 --> 5183.84]  What are you saying?
[5183.84 --> 5184.84]  You're just confusing people.
[5184.84 --> 5185.84]  It's not true.
[5185.84 --> 5186.76]  You're just confusing people.
[5186.76 --> 5190.76]  Xbox One is not suitable for 4K gaming.
[5190.76 --> 5191.76]  Mark my words.
[5191.76 --> 5194.76]  4K gaming is coming to PC now.
[5194.76 --> 5198.76]  4K gaming is not coming to console for a very, very long time.
[5198.76 --> 5202.76]  Well, at least 10 years unless they have some crazy add-on pack or something.
[5202.76 --> 5204.76]  Unless they have some weird expansion thing.
[5204.76 --> 5205.76]  Well, hold on a second.
[5205.76 --> 5207.76]  Because it wouldn't be the first time that ever happened.
[5207.76 --> 5208.76]  I know!
[5208.76 --> 5209.76]  Yep!
[5209.76 --> 5210.76]  Sega Genesis?
[5210.76 --> 5211.76]  Yep!
[5211.76 --> 5214.76]  So it could happen, but it's going to have to be something that you slap on the console
[5214.76 --> 5217.76]  or it's going to be a revision 2 of the console or something like that.
[5217.76 --> 5218.76]  It's...
[5218.76 --> 5220.76]  I mean, how much do you miss cartridges at this point?
[5220.76 --> 5221.76]  Star Fox?
[5221.76 --> 5222.76]  Oh!
[5222.76 --> 5223.76]  This is a completely different thing!
[5223.76 --> 5226.76]  Let's just put more supplemental hardware on the game!
[5226.76 --> 5227.76]  Boom!
[5227.76 --> 5228.76]  Cartridges are awesome!
[5228.76 --> 5229.76]  I hate discs!
[5229.76 --> 5230.76]  I've never liked discs!
[5230.76 --> 5231.76]  I know!
[5231.76 --> 5232.76]  Floppies were cool!
[5232.76 --> 5233.76]  Cartridges were cool!
[5233.76 --> 5234.76]  Discs suck!
[5234.76 --> 5235.76]  Floppies sucked!
[5235.76 --> 5236.76]  Discs always sucked!
[5236.76 --> 5237.76]  But floppies were cool!
[5237.76 --> 5242.76]  You're too young to ever have actually had a situation where you had a report that you
[5242.76 --> 5247.76]  had to print out at school only to discover that your floppy disk broke or just was...
[5247.76 --> 5251.76]  I actually did have to do that, but it was such a low grade that I don't think it mattered.
[5251.76 --> 5252.76]  They were so unreliable.
[5252.76 --> 5253.76]  They were terrible.
[5253.76 --> 5254.76]  But they were cool!
[5254.76 --> 5257.76]  The first time I got a USB thumb drive, it was an 8 meg drive.
[5257.76 --> 5258.76]  You're so stoked!
[5258.76 --> 5259.76]  And it was the best thing that ever happened.
[5259.76 --> 5260.76]  Yeah.
[5260.76 --> 5264.76]  That was one of my favorite technology things that I ever owned.
[5264.76 --> 5265.76]  I'm not saying they were good.
[5265.76 --> 5266.76]  I'm saying they were cool.
[5266.76 --> 5268.76]  I liked the idea of floppy...
[5268.76 --> 5269.76]  I don't know.
[5269.76 --> 5270.76]  I just...
[5270.76 --> 5271.76]  Ugh.
[5271.76 --> 5272.76]  Speaking of discs...
[5272.76 --> 5273.76]  Um...
[5273.76 --> 5274.76]  Where's my topic for this?
[5274.76 --> 5276.76]  I don't remember where it is.
[5276.76 --> 5277.76]  Uh...
[5277.76 --> 5278.76]  Uh...
[5278.76 --> 5279.76]  Some game that I wanted to buy.
[5279.76 --> 5280.76]  Payday 2!
[5280.76 --> 5283.76]  Payday 2 does not have a physical copy.
[5283.76 --> 5288.76]  I think there might be like a physical crazy collector's edition or something that's insanely expensive.
[5288.76 --> 5289.76]  You know what?
[5289.76 --> 5290.76]  Who cares?
[5290.76 --> 5291.76]  Move on.
[5291.76 --> 5292.76]  No.
[5292.76 --> 5293.76]  I disagree with you.
[5293.76 --> 5295.76]  I think physical copies are the stupidest thing ever.
[5295.76 --> 5296.76]  They're dead.
[5296.76 --> 5297.76]  Ugh.
[5297.76 --> 5300.76]  But then you run into things like, what if Steam drops support?
[5301.76 --> 5302.76]  What if something drops support?
[5302.76 --> 5304.76]  Like old school games, I can still play Red Alert.
[5304.76 --> 5305.76]  Okay.
[5305.76 --> 5310.76]  If Red Alert was a game running on a service back then, that wouldn't exist anymore.
[5310.76 --> 5311.76]  Okay, back up your Steam files.
[5311.76 --> 5321.76]  Because Valve said outright that they'll find a way for titles purchased through Steam to be still playable if they ever go completely insolvent or shut down the service.
[5321.76 --> 5322.76]  Ugh.
[5322.76 --> 5323.76]  Back up all your Steam files?
[5323.76 --> 5324.76]  How many...
[5324.76 --> 5325.76]  Can you actually ask that of everyone?
[5325.76 --> 5327.76]  I don't think it's that unreasonable.
[5327.76 --> 5333.76]  If you can ask someone to buy a physical copy of a disc, which is like, worth what, 20 cents?
[5333.76 --> 5334.76]  Who cares?
[5334.76 --> 5338.76]  Then is it that unreasonable to say, okay, okay, okay, here.
[5338.76 --> 5344.76]  Is it more work to burn a disc than it is to go to a freaking store to buy a game?
[5344.76 --> 5346.76]  But do you have right to burn that disc?
[5347.76 --> 5349.76]  To copy Steam files to a disc?
[5349.76 --> 5350.76]  Do you?
[5350.76 --> 5351.76]  Yeah, sure.
[5351.76 --> 5352.76]  You can back up Steam files all day long.
[5352.76 --> 5354.76]  They even have a built-in backup feature.
[5354.76 --> 5357.76]  If you can back it up to a folder, you can back it up to a CD.
[5357.76 --> 5360.76]  I still personally like physical, having something physical.
[5360.76 --> 5363.76]  And I still wish it was a cartridge for console games.
[5363.76 --> 5371.76]  I think that we should probably all be able to agree that when it comes to movies, video games, and women, digital is just as good as physical.
[5371.76 --> 5376.76]  Of course you had to drop that.
[5376.76 --> 5377.76]  I don't think so.
[5377.76 --> 5378.76]  I still disagree.
[5378.76 --> 5380.76]  I still like having something physical.
[5380.76 --> 5381.76]  Okay, I'll give you movies.
[5381.76 --> 5382.76]  Not women?
[5382.76 --> 5384.76]  Not significant others?
[5384.76 --> 5390.76]  Dude, if I could give you women, that would be a whole other business that Linus Media Group is running.
[5390.76 --> 5394.76]  We have to put the significant others thing on there.
[5394.76 --> 5396.76]  It might not necessarily apply to everyone.
[5397.76 --> 5398.76]  Animated PNGs.
[5398.76 --> 5399.76]  Ah, yes.
[5399.76 --> 5400.76]  Animated PNGs.
[5400.76 --> 5401.76]  So this is...
[5401.76 --> 5405.76]  So the GIF, or it's pronounced JIF.
[5405.76 --> 5406.76]  Oh, it's...
[5406.76 --> 5408.76]  How about that?
[5408.76 --> 5412.76]  The days may be numbered for that guy right there.
[5412.76 --> 5413.76]  Here it is.
[5413.76 --> 5414.76]  There's a Kickstarter.
[5414.76 --> 5417.76]  Let us animate PNG.
[5417.76 --> 5419.76]  So this was posted by Ghost on the forum.
[5419.76 --> 5421.76]  Ghost, you're awesome by the way.
[5421.76 --> 5425.76]  You were kind of annoying in the early days of the forum, but we both really like you now.
[5425.76 --> 5426.76]  You're awesome dude.
[5426.76 --> 5429.76]  Kind of annoying because he told us everything was broken.
[5429.76 --> 5431.76]  Well yeah, he was right.
[5431.76 --> 5435.76]  I think he even stopped coming to the forum at some point outright.
[5435.76 --> 5436.76]  He did.
[5436.76 --> 5437.76]  He came back when we fixed it.
[5437.76 --> 5438.76]  I'm glad he came back, because I like him.
[5438.76 --> 5443.76]  Anyways, so you can view a demo of the difference between a GIF...
[5443.76 --> 5444.76]  Why don't we play it?
[5444.76 --> 5445.76]  You have to have Firefox...
[5445.76 --> 5446.76]  Oh, that video.
[5446.76 --> 5447.76]  Sure.
[5447.76 --> 5448.76]  Yeah!
[5448.76 --> 5449.76]  Let's play the video.
[5449.76 --> 5452.76]  Hello everybody and welcome to the Apengasm Animated PNG Tools and Standardization Project.
[5452.76 --> 5458.76]  Apengasm is the Animated PNG Assembler and it is currently the only tool that fully supports
[5458.76 --> 5460.76]  creating animated PNGs.
[5460.76 --> 5466.76]  Apengs like animate goals will have a Java native version and a CoffeeScript and JavaScript native
[5466.76 --> 5468.76]  version so that it can be used in different places.
[5468.76 --> 5476.76]  Further goals include SVG and SMIL conversion and a full animation editor for SVG and SMIL.
[5476.76 --> 5480.76]  For more information, please see the project description.
[5480.76 --> 5482.76]  So, that's pretty cool, hey?
[5482.76 --> 5483.76]  Stop!
[5483.76 --> 5484.76]  Oh, sorry.
[5484.76 --> 5485.76]  I'm trying to stop the thing.
[5485.76 --> 5487.76]  I'm not having success here.
[5487.76 --> 5489.76]  I think that's awesome.
[5489.76 --> 5490.76]  It is awesome.
[5490.76 --> 5491.76]  I like everything about it.
[5491.76 --> 5493.76]  I'm surprised it got funded.
[5493.76 --> 5495.76]  And it got funded fast.
[5495.76 --> 5496.76]  Yeah.
[5496.76 --> 5501.76]  So, they have beat their $5,000 goal in only eight days, which is outstanding.
[5501.76 --> 5502.76]  That's awesome.
[5502.76 --> 5504.76]  In fact, quite a few backers.
[5504.76 --> 5506.76]  One backer pledged $2,500.
[5506.76 --> 5509.76]  So, there was a single backer that's like, yep, here we go.
[5509.76 --> 5510.76]  So, what does he get?
[5510.76 --> 5515.76]  Ports of our base Apeng libraries and tools for the language platform of your choice.
[5515.76 --> 5518.76]  You and your company will be fully accredited.
[5518.76 --> 5519.76]  Cool.
[5519.76 --> 5520.76]  So, um...
[5520.76 --> 5522.76]  It's better.
[5522.76 --> 5523.76]  Yeah, it's time for...
[5523.76 --> 5524.76]  In like, every way.
[5524.76 --> 5525.76]  I'm stoked.
[5525.76 --> 5526.76]  That's cool.
[5526.76 --> 5528.76]  So, 4chan can be in HD now.
[5528.76 --> 5529.76]  4chan's the...
[5529.76 --> 5530.76]  What?
[5530.76 --> 5540.76]  No, just everything, half the things that are posted on there are animated GIFs as far
[5540.76 --> 5541.76]  as I can tell.
[5541.76 --> 5544.76]  So, now it can like, look better.
[5544.76 --> 5546.76]  Or we can even...
[5546.76 --> 5553.76]  We can have even higher resolution, disgusting, animated stuff on like, the armpit of the internet.
[5553.76 --> 5554.76]  I just...
[5554.76 --> 5556.76]  It looks a lot better.
[5556.76 --> 5557.76]  It takes less data.
[5557.76 --> 5562.76]  And like, the most ridiculous thing with GIFs is how long they take to load.
[5562.76 --> 5563.76]  Right.
[5563.76 --> 5564.76]  Trying not to say GIF.
[5564.76 --> 5565.76]  Um...
[5565.76 --> 5566.76]  Because they just take forever to load.
[5566.76 --> 5567.76]  So, I don't know.
[5567.76 --> 5568.76]  Everything is better about this.
[5568.76 --> 5570.76]  My favorite thing is that it just takes less.
[5570.76 --> 5572.76]  I'm excited about transparency support.
[5572.76 --> 5573.76]  That's cool.
[5573.76 --> 5574.76]  That's really cool.
[5574.76 --> 5575.76]  That's definitely cool.
[5575.76 --> 5578.76]  I mean, that's something that would be great for even things like WAN Show.
[5578.76 --> 5582.76]  If we could have like, an animated thing that supports alpha channels that's transparent.
[5582.76 --> 5584.76]  So, we could have like, moving junk.
[5584.76 --> 5585.76]  Um, I mean...
[5585.76 --> 5586.76]  We're gonna go back to like...
[5586.76 --> 5591.76]  XSplit's gonna have to, you know, step things up a little bit too, but...
[5591.76 --> 5594.76]  We're gonna have to go back to like, 90s level internet webpages.
[5594.76 --> 5596.76]  2002.
[5596.76 --> 5598.76]  A little bit past 90s.
[5598.76 --> 5601.76]  Speaking of going back in time, check this out.
[5601.76 --> 5602.76]  So, the upcoming...
[5602.76 --> 5603.76]  Oh.
[5603.76 --> 5604.76]  Oh, wow.
[5604.76 --> 5605.76]  The page has been pulled down.
[5605.76 --> 5606.76]  Okay.
[5606.76 --> 5614.76]  Well, at any rate, um, the upcoming Ivy Bridge E 4670K has been de-lidded by one of the overclockers
[5614.76 --> 5616.76]  over on Kulowler.com.
[5616.76 --> 5622.76]  And basically, they've discovered that the IHS is soldered down to the CPU core.
[5622.76 --> 5623.76]  This does a couple of things.
[5623.76 --> 5626.76]  Number one is it makes it harder to remove.
[5626.76 --> 5627.76]  Yep.
[5627.76 --> 5628.76]  He destroyed his chip doing that.
[5628.76 --> 5629.76]  Yep.
[5629.76 --> 5634.76]  Number two is it de-incentivizes people to remove the bloody thing because you're going
[5634.76 --> 5639.76]  to get better thermal performance by having the die soldered to the top of the integrated
[5639.76 --> 5643.76]  heat spreader versus having a thermal compound in there.
[5643.76 --> 5649.76]  Um, it also means that there won't be as much inconsistency because having a solid metal
[5649.76 --> 5656.76]  layer means no air pockets can get stuck and the IHS won't be as prone to, uh, being sort
[5656.76 --> 5660.76]  of not, not attached in one spot or whatever else the case may be.
[5660.76 --> 5662.76]  So, that's great.
[5662.76 --> 5667.76]  I guess what Intel's saying is when it comes to our server grade products, we do actually
[5667.76 --> 5669.76]  know that solder is better.
[5669.76 --> 5670.76]  Hmm.
[5670.76 --> 5671.76]  So, they do know.
[5671.76 --> 5673.76]  Deep down, they do know.
[5673.76 --> 5674.76]  I'm happy to see this.
[5674.76 --> 5677.76]  Kind of sad for the dude that lost his chip right away.
[5677.76 --> 5679.76]  Oh, he probably has a half a dozen of them.
[5679.76 --> 5684.76]  Like those, those extreme overclocker guys, they get like a tray of CPUs pre-launch and
[5684.76 --> 5686.76]  do a bunch of benching and all that kind of stuff.
[5686.76 --> 5687.76]  Right, okay, yeah.
[5687.76 --> 5688.76]  Yeah, I'm not too worried about him.
[5688.76 --> 5689.76]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[5689.76 --> 5690.76]  Stoked to see that.
[5690.76 --> 5692.76]  Alright, well.
[5692.76 --> 5693.76]  BitPhoenix Prodigy M.
[5693.76 --> 5694.76]  Yeah.
[5694.76 --> 5695.76]  This is exciting.
[5695.76 --> 5700.76]  So, one of the things that was noticed by the reviewers and enthusiast community at
[5700.76 --> 5706.76]  large, this was post by Ssweily, or however you pronounce that, located in Belgium.
[5706.76 --> 5707.76]  Ssoul.
[5707.76 --> 5708.76]  Yeah.
[5708.76 --> 5709.76]  Oh, I love that guy.
[5709.76 --> 5710.76]  He's awesome.
[5710.76 --> 5714.76]  Anyway, so there's a product guided tour apparently.
[5714.76 --> 5718.76]  Apparently BitPhoenix thinks they can do them better than us instead of having us do their
[5718.76 --> 5719.76]  product tours.
[5719.76 --> 5725.76]  Actually, I just got off an email thread with BitPhoenix yesterday where we were going back
[5725.76 --> 5726.76]  and forth pretty good.
[5726.76 --> 5730.76]  We are going to be getting samples of pretty much every upcoming BitPhoenix thing, so we
[5730.76 --> 5732.76]  will be bringing you guys more BitPhoenix videos.
[5732.76 --> 5733.76]  Okay.
[5733.76 --> 5735.76]  So that's a new development that I don't think Slick knew about yet.
[5735.76 --> 5736.76]  Okay.
[5736.76 --> 5737.76]  Did not.
[5737.76 --> 5741.76]  The thing that people noticed about the Prodigy was that it wasn't that small.
[5741.76 --> 5745.76]  It was about the size of MATX cases but took an ITX motherboard.
[5745.76 --> 5755.76]  In fact, Silverstone went full shots fired mode against BitPhoenix by basically saying,
[5755.76 --> 5762.76]  well, if you look at the actual volume of the case, we have MATX cases that are smaller
[5762.76 --> 5767.76]  than this that fit hardware pretty well too.
[5767.76 --> 5772.76]  So what they've done is they have completely rearranged the interior in order to accommodate
[5772.76 --> 5773.76]  an MATX board.
[5773.76 --> 5779.76]  So they no longer have the flat mounting idea that they had for the ITX board.
[5779.76 --> 5781.76]  It's again a vertically mounted motherboard.
[5781.76 --> 5784.76]  I'm going to just like zoom in as far as I possibly can here.
[5784.76 --> 5785.76]  240p!
[5785.76 --> 5786.76]  Yeah, yeah!
[5786.76 --> 5787.76]  Alright!
[5787.76 --> 5788.76]  Okay, so there you go.
[5788.76 --> 5790.76]  You can kind of see it now.
[5790.76 --> 5793.76]  So here's where the motherboard is.
[5793.76 --> 5795.76]  It's an upside down motherboard arrangement.
[5795.76 --> 5797.76]  Drives go, I think, here.
[5797.76 --> 5800.76]  And then it supports liquid cooling in the back.
[5800.76 --> 5802.76]  With a, yeah, one radiator.
[5802.76 --> 5803.76]  Yeah.
[5803.76 --> 5806.76]  So there's, yeah, there's less support.
[5806.76 --> 5810.76]  Like one cool thing that we saw in the Prodigy before was the insane water cooling builds.
[5810.76 --> 5811.76]  Yes.
[5811.76 --> 5813.76]  Where people would fit all the radiators.
[5813.76 --> 5814.76]  And there will be less of that.
[5814.76 --> 5815.76]  There will be less of that.
[5815.76 --> 5817.76]  But it's a more practical case.
[5817.76 --> 5818.76]  Yep.
[5818.76 --> 5819.76]  So good work, BitPhoenix.
[5819.76 --> 5820.76]  We love it.
[5820.76 --> 5822.76]  And I hope they keep around the original Prodigy.
[5822.76 --> 5824.76]  I hope they just have two different products.
[5824.76 --> 5825.76]  Yes, they will.
[5825.76 --> 5826.76]  Which I think they're doing.
[5826.76 --> 5827.76]  Yes.
[5827.76 --> 5828.76]  That is confirmed.
[5828.76 --> 5831.76]  We talked to them about it at Computex when I covered their booth, not you.
[5831.76 --> 5833.76]  So I have seen this already.
[5833.76 --> 5834.76]  The layout is actually pretty smart.
[5834.76 --> 5835.76]  It looks good.
[5835.76 --> 5836.76]  Cool.
[5836.76 --> 5837.76]  It looks good.
[5837.76 --> 5838.76]  Alright.
[5838.76 --> 5839.76]  Unless you have anything else.
[5839.76 --> 5841.76]  We gotta do the Build Logs of the Week.
[5841.76 --> 5842.76]  Yes.
[5842.76 --> 5846.76]  We've got some pretty epic ones that I know you've seen at least one of.
[5846.76 --> 5847.76]  Alright.
[5847.76 --> 5849.76]  He did finish on time, which I was happy about.
[5849.76 --> 5850.76]  Ooh.
[5850.76 --> 5851.76]  Alright, Build Logs of the Week.
[5851.76 --> 5854.76]  Let's go ahead and download this mother.
[5854.76 --> 5855.76]  On 3G.
[5855.76 --> 5856.76]  Yeah, I know, right?
[5856.76 --> 5858.76]  Like, my data, Bill.
[5858.76 --> 5860.76]  Just like, whatever.
[5860.76 --> 5864.76]  The good news is I have lots of, oh, I'm downloading two instances of it right now.
[5864.76 --> 5865.76]  Cancel one!
[5865.76 --> 5866.76]  No, no, stop!
[5866.76 --> 5867.76]  Cancel one of them!
[5867.76 --> 5868.76]  Oh no, I canceled the wrong one!
[5868.76 --> 5869.76]  Ah!
[5869.76 --> 5872.76]  Don't you hate that when you have two instances coming down and you cancel the one that's
[5872.76 --> 5873.76]  more complete?
[5873.76 --> 5874.76]  Yeah.
[5874.76 --> 5876.76]  Like, just FML moments.
[5876.76 --> 5882.76]  Or like, when you commit something to the printer queue, and then, because printers are
[5882.76 --> 5886.76]  apparently still stuck in the 80s, you can never... have you ever successfully cancelled
[5886.76 --> 5887.76]  a print job?
[5887.76 --> 5888.76]  Never.
[5888.76 --> 5892.76]  I've only ever been able to do it physically on the printer, and it just cancels everything.
[5892.76 --> 5893.76]  That usually doesn't even work for me.
[5893.76 --> 5897.76]  It's the... it... I do somewhat okay with that.
[5897.76 --> 5900.76]  There was one time when I really had to cancel it.
[5900.76 --> 5902.76]  Like, it was like 60 pages.
[5902.76 --> 5907.76]  And what I had to do was I unplugged the printer, and then just re-plugged it in.
[5907.76 --> 5910.76]  Sometimes, even when you do that, it'll just re-grab the job and keep going.
[5910.76 --> 5913.76]  It was an old printer, so it didn't... it wasn't that advanced yet.
[5913.76 --> 5914.76]  Okay, cool.
[5914.76 --> 5916.76]  Alright, so moving right along, guys, here.
[5916.76 --> 5919.76]  Project Cobalt by Jordan Mack.
[5919.76 --> 5921.76]  This one... BOOOOOM!
[5921.76 --> 5922.76]  It's just awesome.
[5922.76 --> 5923.76]  Holy crap.
[5923.76 --> 5926.76]  Like, I wish we could show this in its HD glory.
[5926.76 --> 5927.76]  We're at 240p!
[5927.76 --> 5929.76]  I'm sorry, Jordan Mack.
[5929.76 --> 5930.76]  Oh, man.
[5930.76 --> 5935.76]  Okay, all of these guys, like, we're gonna show pictures, but check it on the freaking
[5935.76 --> 5936.76]  forum.
[5936.76 --> 5938.76]  Build Logs section of the forum.
[5938.76 --> 5939.76]  Check the Build Logs of the Week thread.
[5939.76 --> 5941.76]  Isn't this thing beautiful?
[5941.76 --> 5946.76]  I actually tweeted a picture of this mid-plate earlier this week, because I was just blown
[5946.76 --> 5947.76]  away.
[5947.76 --> 5950.76]  He's gonna be doing a comprehensive guide on how to make them, and he's gonna be posting
[5950.76 --> 5952.76]  it in our guide section on the forum.
[5952.76 --> 5953.76]  Jordan, you win.
[5953.76 --> 5955.76]  I'm probably gonna make one.
[5955.76 --> 5956.76]  I don't even know what you win.
[5956.76 --> 5957.76]  It's so cool.
[5957.76 --> 5959.76]  You win seven of them, though.
[5959.76 --> 5961.76]  Just seven... things.
[5961.76 --> 5962.76]  Seven things.
[5962.76 --> 5964.76]  So he's got Kuiper... Kuiper?
[5964.76 --> 5967.76]  He invented a new metal.
[5967.76 --> 5971.76]  He has copper piping, which he has painted.
[5971.76 --> 5972.76]  No.
[5972.76 --> 5973.76]  Plated.
[5973.76 --> 5974.76]  Plated.
[5974.76 --> 5975.76]  Sorry.
[5975.76 --> 5978.76]  Paint plating on the copper tubing.
[5978.76 --> 5981.76]  And beautifully sleeved cables.
[5981.76 --> 5982.76]  Mayhem.
[5982.76 --> 5983.76]  Blue fluid.
[5983.76 --> 5984.76]  Gorgeous.
[5984.76 --> 5985.76]  Pastel blue, I believe.
[5985.76 --> 5986.76]  I'm not sure.
[5986.76 --> 5987.76]  Yep.
[5987.76 --> 5991.76]  Drilled holes through this mid-plate that looks like you could damage it, because it
[5991.76 --> 5993.76]  looks like a freaking PCB.
[5993.76 --> 5994.76]  Yeah.
[5994.76 --> 5995.76]  Just...
[5995.76 --> 5996.76]  Oh, look at these...
[5996.76 --> 5997.76]  Oh, look at these tubing runs.
[5997.76 --> 5998.76]  Man.
[5998.76 --> 5999.76]  The runs are super nice.
[5999.76 --> 6002.76]  And like, without the mid-plate on, it looked a little bit weird with his runs, but then
[6002.76 --> 6005.76]  once the mid-plate's on, it makes tons of sense and looks great.
[6005.76 --> 6006.76]  Yep.
[6006.76 --> 6007.76]  And Slick...
[6007.76 --> 6008.76]  This is the...
[6008.76 --> 6011.76]  I actually gave Slick a GTX 670, which he refuses to install on his computer because of
[6011.76 --> 6012.76]  the mini PCB.
[6012.76 --> 6013.76]  Boom.
[6013.76 --> 6016.76]  If it's good enough for him, it's good enough for you.
[6016.76 --> 6017.76]  Boom.
[6017.76 --> 6018.76]  Ah.
[6018.76 --> 6019.76]  Beautiful machine.
[6019.76 --> 6022.76]  Anyway, guys, go check it out.
[6022.76 --> 6025.76]  Great sleeving, which we've just kind of come to expect from the big builds.
[6025.76 --> 6026.76]  There's a...
[6026.76 --> 6029.76]  This build, I wanted to show how he does the underlighting for the...
[6029.76 --> 6030.76]  There we go.
[6030.76 --> 6033.76]  So now you don't see the glare from the LED strips.
[6033.76 --> 6034.76]  This is with the side panel on.
[6034.76 --> 6035.76]  Man, that's beautiful.
[6035.76 --> 6038.76]  So it looks better, but it's not as comprehensive as the previous shot.
[6038.76 --> 6039.76]  That's the only reason why I want it.
[6039.76 --> 6041.76]  Alright, moving on to our next build bug.
[6041.76 --> 6044.76]  The 15TB BitPhoenix Prodigy by Jimstar87.
[6044.76 --> 6047.76]  I thought you might like this one especially.
[6047.76 --> 6048.76]  Man.
[6048.76 --> 6049.76]  Love it.
[6049.76 --> 6054.76]  So there's not even a ton to say with this one other than go look at it on the build logs
[6054.76 --> 6055.76]  because you probably can't see it.
[6055.76 --> 6056.76]  Ghetto Mount SSD.
[6056.76 --> 6060.76]  You win for that because I'm all about the ghetto mounted SSDs.
[6060.76 --> 6065.76]  Ghetto mounted SSD, a little fan that helps cool his RAID card and then all the hard drives.
[6065.76 --> 6066.76]  Which is a thing.
[6066.76 --> 6067.76]  Yep.
[6067.76 --> 6068.76]  Those RAID cards run friggin' hot.
[6068.76 --> 6070.76]  They should have better cooling on them.
[6070.76 --> 6075.76]  No, because the way that they're spec'd is not for desktop installation.
[6075.76 --> 6076.76]  Yeah, that's true.
[6076.76 --> 6077.76]  They're spec'd for racks.
[6077.76 --> 6078.76]  That's true.
[6078.76 --> 6083.76]  Where there's expected to be like turbine grade fans drawing air front to back cooling these things.
[6083.76 --> 6084.76]  Yeah, you totally do.
[6084.76 --> 6089.76]  In fact, right in the documentation for the LSI card I believe that I have in my machine,
[6089.76 --> 6094.76]  it says it expects X number of CFM of constant air flow.
[6094.76 --> 6097.76]  You can get one of those Gelid PCI slot fan.
[6097.76 --> 6100.76]  Yeah, if that wouldn't make my machine look ridiculous.
[6100.76 --> 6105.76]  My solution was to put the RAID card down at the very bottom and then I have a basement radiator
[6105.76 --> 6108.76]  that it gets some incidental air flow from and it doesn't overheat.
[6108.76 --> 6109.76]  Yeah.
[6109.76 --> 6110.76]  Here's another, oh man.
[6110.76 --> 6111.76]  Just a better shot.
[6111.76 --> 6114.76]  I just wanted to show that it was actually in a prodigy with the previous shot.
[6114.76 --> 6116.76]  Great choice of WD Reds.
[6116.76 --> 6119.76]  That is definitely the appropriate drive for a machine like this.
[6121.76 --> 6123.76]  And Neptune by JoJo69.
[6123.76 --> 6125.76]  Very inappropriate, JoJo.
[6125.76 --> 6127.76]  Disapprove of that number.
[6127.76 --> 6129.76]  Oh my goodness.
[6129.76 --> 6130.76]  At first I was like, huh?
[6130.76 --> 6131.76]  What?
[6131.76 --> 6137.76]  So, kind of similar idea to one that we saw previously, but he got his cable sleeves,
[6137.76 --> 6142.76]  I believe these are extensions, and then he sewed them himself together if you see those lines.
[6142.76 --> 6143.76]  Sewn together.
[6143.76 --> 6144.76]  Fascinating.
[6144.76 --> 6149.76]  So, the threading doesn't look bad and it keeps them in a very nice neat run.
[6149.76 --> 6150.76]  Right.
[6150.76 --> 6151.76]  Which I thought was very cool.
[6151.76 --> 6156.76]  That was a challenge that I had with my machine was like, how do you make them stay together?
[6156.76 --> 6157.76]  Yeah.
[6157.76 --> 6160.76]  So he sewed them together, which kind of makes sense.
[6160.76 --> 6163.76]  And that's, and not to just bring attention to that, it's a very beautiful build.
[6163.76 --> 6164.76]  Just it...
[6164.76 --> 6166.76]  Yep, nice straight tubing runs.
[6166.76 --> 6167.76]  Always looks gorgeous.
[6167.76 --> 6168.76]  Yep.
[6168.76 --> 6170.76]  A lot of criticism for my Overkill Buyer's Guide.
[6170.76 --> 6174.76]  Linus, you should have used better angled fittings, you should have done straighter tubing
[6174.76 --> 6177.76]  runs, you should have used clear tubing and a coolant, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[6177.76 --> 6182.76]  Guys, it was a build that we were literally going to tear apart as soon as we were done
[6182.76 --> 6183.76]  building it.
[6183.76 --> 6184.76]  So, yes.
[6184.76 --> 6185.76]  You're not wrong.
[6185.76 --> 6188.76]  You're not wrong, but you're also not necessarily right.
[6188.76 --> 6189.76]  Yeah.
[6189.76 --> 6194.76]  One of the things that I personally don't do is invest in very specialized pieces of
[6194.76 --> 6196.76]  hardware that I can't continue to reuse.
[6196.76 --> 6201.76]  Because when I build a rig, my graphics card might be in there for, well, more so in the
[6201.76 --> 6202.76]  past.
[6202.76 --> 6203.76]  I don't change it as much anymore.
[6203.76 --> 6206.76]  But I would look at everything as it needs to be modular.
[6206.76 --> 6208.76]  My graphics card might be in there for two more weeks.
[6208.76 --> 6209.76]  Who knows?
[6209.76 --> 6211.76]  Saying that you have a 590.
[6211.76 --> 6212.76]  I know.
[6212.76 --> 6214.76]  So it's less true these days.
[6214.76 --> 6218.76]  But that's always the approach that I've taken to a rig, is how hard is it to work on
[6218.76 --> 6219.76]  this bloody thing.
[6219.76 --> 6224.76]  So that was why I would never use hard fittings between my SLI'd cards.
[6224.76 --> 6229.76]  I always used tubing because I found it easier to disconnect and pull one card if there was
[6229.76 --> 6230.76]  an issue.
[6230.76 --> 6234.76]  Same thing why I never used particularly angled fittings, because I'd be doing motherboard
[6234.76 --> 6236.76]  swaps every three to four weeks.
[6236.76 --> 6237.76]  So, no.
[6237.76 --> 6240.76]  I'm not buying full cover motherboard blocks.
[6240.76 --> 6242.76]  Not in my dictionary.
[6242.76 --> 6246.76]  That's, ugh, yes, but that's not necessarily applicable to everyone.
[6246.76 --> 6247.76]  No, it's not.
[6247.76 --> 6251.76]  It's just, that's why I took, that's my personal philosophy.
[6251.76 --> 6256.76]  And if you were doing a one run of that build though, I personally agree with them.
[6256.76 --> 6259.76]  We should have done 10-inch straighter runs, but we're tearing it down.
[6259.76 --> 6261.76]  So, there's that.
[6261.76 --> 6264.76]  And like, we showed a, that was just a better shot of the computer.
[6264.76 --> 6265.76]  Looks gorgeous.
[6265.76 --> 6266.76]  But I wanted to do a close-in shot.
[6266.76 --> 6268.76]  This one you can see the threading a lot better.
[6268.76 --> 6269.76]  No way.
[6269.76 --> 6271.76]  Is that one of those old Zelman hard drive coolers?
[6271.76 --> 6272.76]  Wow.
[6272.76 --> 6274.76]  You win the internets for that.
[6274.76 --> 6276.76]  I don't even think you can buy those anymore.
[6276.76 --> 6279.76]  And it even matches the color scheme of the build perfectly.
[6279.76 --> 6280.76]  Yeah.
[6280.76 --> 6281.76]  Oops.
[6281.76 --> 6282.76]  I wanted to go back to that shot again.
[6282.76 --> 6283.76]  There we go.
[6283.76 --> 6284.76]  Gorgeous machine.
[6284.76 --> 6285.76]  Really, really good.
[6285.76 --> 6287.76]  And then he, he carbon fiber wrapped.
[6287.76 --> 6288.76]  Yeah.
[6288.76 --> 6289.76]  I was trying to, I was like, there's something I'm missing.
[6289.76 --> 6291.76]  He carbon fiber wrapped like everything.
[6291.76 --> 6293.76]  That carbon fiber wrap.
[6293.76 --> 6294.76]  Absolutely beautiful.
[6294.76 --> 6295.76]  All right.
[6295.76 --> 6299.76]  So, I think that pretty much wraps it up for the WAN show today, guys.
[6299.76 --> 6301.76]  Thank you very much for your patience.
[6301.76 --> 6306.76]  We are going to be on the line with Shaw pretty much immediately after this.
[6306.76 --> 6310.76]  And we are going to see if we can figure out these issues for next week.
[6310.76 --> 6311.76]  And, uh...
[6311.76 --> 6312.76]  I'm just going to call him right now.
[6312.76 --> 6317.76]  Hopefully next week's stream is not in 240p, but thank you for watching anyway.
[6317.76 --> 6318.76]  Good night, everyone.
[6318.76 --> 6319.76]  Thanks, guys.
[6319.76 --> 6321.76]  We will do an after party once everything's working.
[6321.76 --> 6322.76]  Yeah.
[6322.76 --> 6327.76]  I think we're, we're off for after party because the stream has already run a full hour over
[6327.76 --> 6329.76]  time with us diagnosing technical difficulties.
[6329.76 --> 6333.76]  If we get everything working next week, I think we can, we can confirm an after party if we
[6333.76 --> 6334.76]  get everything working next week.
[6334.76 --> 6339.76]  And if you guys follow me on Twitter, you'll have seen that I now have a new workflow for
[6339.76 --> 6345.76]  taking the, um, the video clips that we get out of XSplit, which are variable frame rate,
[6345.76 --> 6348.76]  and making sure that the video and audio don't desync.
[6348.76 --> 6352.76]  So I should be able to get the WAN show uploaded sooner than normal.
[6352.76 --> 6354.76]  And do you have any family functions this weekend?
[6354.76 --> 6355.76]  Yeah.
[6355.76 --> 6356.76]  Okay, well that figures.
[6356.76 --> 6360.76]  But, uh, if you can get it up tonight.
[6360.76 --> 6362.76]  I can get it up anytime you want.
[6362.76 --> 6364.76]  Tonight then, yeah.
[6364.76 --> 6366.76]  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
[6366.76 --> 6367.76]  Ha ha.
