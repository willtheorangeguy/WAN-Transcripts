[0.00 --> 8.24]  Welcome to the WAN Show guys we are finally live apparently I needed to set
[8.24 --> 11.16]  up a stream key because I hadn't configured one before and for some
[11.16 --> 15.68]  reason my twitch credentials were not a thing so we have a fantastic show for
[15.68 --> 19.32]  you guys and I know I always say that but in reality the goal over here is
[19.32 --> 23.16]  that we never bring you a terrible show we have pizza and graphics cards in this
[23.16 --> 27.32]  show yeah we have pizza graphics cards special guest Steve got Steve Gatto I
[27.32 --> 31.22]  don't even know what I'm going for special guest Steve Dotto will be joining
[31.22 --> 36.32]  us in about 20 minutes he's an industry veteran when it comes to tech
[36.32 --> 39.80]  broadcasting so it'll be kind of interesting to get a bit of a different
[39.80 --> 43.04]  perspective we brought on a lot of youtuber guests but Steve actually had
[43.04 --> 47.90]  his own TV show back in the day so he does radio broadcast now so that'll be
[47.90 --> 54.20]  that'll be pretty cool of course the big topics this week the R9 290 launched and
[54.20 --> 60.50]  the GeForce GTX 780 TI launched those were both huge graphics card launches
[60.50 --> 63.50]  equally relevant not like some of the ones we've had over the last little while
[63.50 --> 68.12]  where it's like yay the same thing with actually the same sticker we didn't even
[68.12 --> 72.86]  change the sticker there's a lot of that that went on yeah we've also got Call of
[72.86 --> 79.20]  Duty ghosts is apparently terrible I can't necessarily vouch for that one way or the
[79.20 --> 84.60]  other neither of us have played it but like wow the reviews the reviews are terrible I
[84.60 --> 90.54]  mean that the thing is that I think a lot of the time gamers can can be harsh about things that
[90.54 --> 94.92]  displease and blow things out of proportion and blow things out of proportion I mean there was the
[94.92 --> 99.96]  whole thing where where President Obama's Facebook was getting spammed with people
[99.96 --> 104.70]  being upset about valve not running a holiday Halloween thing and I'm kind of looking at this
[104.70 --> 110.10]  going like Obama and like Volvo and all this yeah it's like I understand your your your
[110.10 --> 115.08]  butthurt about valve not doing a thing but the cold hard truth is they they don't they don't have
[115.08 --> 121.40]  to and President Obama doesn't care about that I hope he doesn't I hope he doesn't think on more
[121.40 --> 125.48]  important yeah I hope Obama is focused on more important stuff unless he plays Dota fixing all this
[125.48 --> 130.14]  NSA nonsense Google actually has a couple employees that have been speaking out about the NSA more on that
[130.14 --> 133.66]  in a moment and I'll let you actually introduced a couple topics to at some point here or I could just keep
[133.66 --> 137.80]  talking and you would never have an opportunity to say anything go well that's usually how the
[137.80 --> 143.98]  streams run well not usually just most of the time which could be seen as usually you're so fired
[143.98 --> 150.76]  so our first topic if you can bring it up on your laptop oh no there were other topics to introduce
[150.76 --> 155.44]  Nvidia Tegra oh you talked for so long I thought you got through them all no I actually just got
[155.44 --> 162.00]  completely sidetracked okay so Nvidia Tegra note 7 is a thing and it's an awesome thing at I think only 200
[162.00 --> 169.10]  bucks you get a really nice IPS screen and like Nvidia shield capabilities to certain degrees which
[169.10 --> 173.76]  is like all I really need to care about well that device for it to be awesome all right I think I
[173.76 --> 178.92]  said that it's already 200 bucks and Microsoft promises to better the future of PC gaming the
[178.92 --> 185.36]  keyword by getting rid of Windows Windows Live Windows Live yeah which is already a huge step in
[185.36 --> 188.26]  the right direction so without further ado intro time
[188.26 --> 189.22]  hope you're right
[189.22 --> 217.86]  so guys our sponsor for the show today is Squarespace you can visit squarespace.com slash

[235.98 --> 241.50]  going to have a special giveaway to do with Squarespace later on and we'll give you the full details those who
[241.50 --> 245.24]  were watching the pre-show will probably already know about it and are probably already flooding the
[245.24 --> 250.80]  twitch chat with it but not too much so far but it might be a delay so yeah trust me it'll be cool
[250.80 --> 257.78]  it's gonna be awesome all right so let's move into our first topic here pizza pizza pizza pizza dot be
[257.78 --> 264.62]  slash en this is the most amazing website that I think anyone has ever seen ever apparently you have
[264.62 --> 271.08]  to reselect your language but that's okay so apparently manually navigating to slash en doesn't actually
[271.08 --> 275.76]  make it english but I'll let you explain what this is because if you guys recall last week on the
[275.76 --> 279.92]  stream we had a pizza delivered in the middle of the stream which was amazing and it was from
[279.92 --> 284.40]  some of the guys on the forum thank you so much for that but this this takes it to a whole new level
[284.40 --> 290.32]  so these guys have a few websites around uh like Europe and Scandinavia and a few other places
[290.32 --> 296.50]  um the pizza dot whatever and if you go to their website if you live there you can put in your address
[296.50 --> 301.90]  and it'll show all the different options for pizza like all of them that will deliver to your address
[301.90 --> 307.56]  so say you live there you can just be like well I want to try a new pizza place my address oh I have
[307.56 --> 312.54]  all of these options say you're a tourist you can go to the website select English type in the address
[312.54 --> 316.56]  which is possibly the only thing you know how to say in that country because it was written down for
[316.56 --> 321.10]  you um and you can have pizza delivered which is sweet I know multiple times that would have been
[321.10 --> 325.00]  helpful when I was visiting somewhere could not speak the language and wanted to eat something
[325.00 --> 330.32]  because that can actually be surprisingly difficult I just bought it a pizza I just want a pizza so
[330.32 --> 335.52]  like it should be this is this is the one for Belgium um and it should be this easy everywhere
[335.52 --> 339.74]  but this is the only one I really know of I think they have like a UK one and a Belgium one and a
[339.74 --> 344.78]  Netherlands one I like think that's it and I just thought this was fantastic so I wanted to share the
[344.78 --> 351.50]  awesomeness with everybody all right so we have an article up next on eurogamer.net so let's go ahead and
[351.50 --> 359.42]  fire this baby up xbox one launch title devs on the xbox one power debate because if you guys have
[359.42 --> 364.88]  been paying any attention to playstation 4 versus xbox one the general consensus seems to be that
[364.88 --> 371.98]  ps4 has something like 50 percent more raw horsepower in terms of producing graphical stuff and that could
[371.98 --> 377.14]  amount to as much as I think the example I saw was tomb raider where they were saying around a 25 percent
[377.14 --> 381.48]  better frame rate like 25 percent better performance yeah there's extra headroom because
[381.48 --> 385.78]  the xbox is doing all this other stuff all at the same time right because guys the hardware inside
[385.78 --> 389.88]  them is actually very similar it's just the way that it's being implemented and remember too though
[389.88 --> 395.70]  that xbox one has all of that cloud processing that can throw at game developers in order to
[395.70 --> 400.58]  potentially but then there's certain issues with people having fast enough internet connections and
[400.58 --> 405.68]  all of course of course so I mean the experience might be better or worse for certain people we
[405.68 --> 409.78]  don't actually know how that's all gonna come out yet but anyway the article has them quoted saying
[409.78 --> 417.42]  it's less to do with the specs and more to do with what you do with those specs so let's go ahead and
[417.42 --> 423.16]  have a look at sort of some of the examples of what they're doing with said specs so devrising 3
[423.16 --> 425.34]  720p 30 fps
[425.34 --> 434.98]  forza motorsport 5 1080p 60 fps okay that's good that is how every if you're gonna call something next
[434.98 --> 439.08]  generation that is how every single next generation thing should be running because
[439.08 --> 445.08]  1080p 60 fps ain't next generation for the pc gamers out there no that's like acceptable that's
[445.08 --> 452.14]  like okay yeah that that looks all right um but I mean the thing about something like forza is
[452.14 --> 457.72]  racing games have already looked about as good as they're gonna look for like five years I mean have
[457.72 --> 461.94]  you seen dramatically improved visuals in a racing game in the last few years compared to something like
[461.94 --> 466.34]  just because everyone's making them for consoles well I mean it could look better if it's on a pc
[466.34 --> 470.74]  okay okay it could look better if it's done but there's not that much you can do you can make the
[470.74 --> 474.36]  cars shinier I mean look at what they do in need for speed it's like oh add all the reflections
[474.36 --> 480.12]  but you could add detail to the road you could add detail to anyone that's watching on the side of the
[480.12 --> 485.70]  road like the cars are highly detailed but in theory you're moving so fast that the detail of the dude
[485.70 --> 489.90]  standing there like as you slow down at the finish line you'll notice like they can make changes
[489.90 --> 493.78]  everyone works pretty hard on like the chick that walks between the cars and is like
[493.78 --> 498.04]  waves around the thing and then you know work on jiggle physics or whatever else they're gonna do
[498.04 --> 503.84]  because that's what apparently gamers want according to game devs um no idea where they got that idea
[503.84 --> 508.22]  so they work on certain things but yes they could improve the visual fidelity but in terms of the
[508.22 --> 513.28]  actual racing experience the trees already look great you know pretty good landscapes already look
[513.28 --> 517.44]  pretty good landscapes haven't been that demanding for a while especially when you're going along at 250
[517.44 --> 521.32]  miles an hour but they could add more grass and stuff they could add more grass really look at
[521.32 --> 526.52]  what you're asking for they could add more grass they have to find places to improve we've had this
[526.52 --> 530.70]  thing forever when you when you double polygon count it becomes less noticeable over time yes
[530.70 --> 535.28]  diminishing returns of noticeable improvements so they have to find places to improve that is somewhere
[535.28 --> 539.28]  that they could improve basically a racing game is pretty easy to optimize for is what we're trying
[539.28 --> 543.42]  to say because short of adding more grass there's not much that remains to be done in terms of
[543.42 --> 548.92]  improving the visual fidelity so that one runs at 1080p 60fps next up we've got rise son of rome
[548.92 --> 556.74]  running at 900p 30fps so it couldn't quite couldn't quite make it at 1080p it needed 900p which 900p
[556.74 --> 562.36]  upscale to 1080p is actually not going to look that bad um and then connect sports rivals really a connect
[562.36 --> 570.86]  game that runs at 1080p 30fps connect sports game 1080p 30fps so to me i'm looking at this kind of going
[570.86 --> 575.86]  um okay you can talk about how it's less to do with specs and more to do with what you do
[575.86 --> 583.34]  with them but your specs are horrible xbox 360 and playstation 3 launched with compelling truly next
[583.34 --> 589.94]  generation specs or at least 3's processor was like interesting hard to hard to harness but interesting
[589.94 --> 597.14]  but very interesting and very powerful whereas xbox one and ps4 are coming in pretty far behind
[597.14 --> 602.50]  the eight ball from the very start and i think looking at the settings that these games that
[602.50 --> 607.44]  really from from again so even looking at last generation console games and the way that they
[607.44 --> 613.90]  ran on pc we're not looking at any kind of improvement in fidelity compared to that and there's a lot of
[613.90 --> 620.34]  talk about how consoles will get much better over time in terms of what what the developers can squeeze
[620.34 --> 624.80]  out of them and a great example of that is grand theft auto 5 that looks absolutely fantastic
[624.80 --> 632.94]  compared to almost anything else that you can even play on an xbox 360 and yet
[632.94 --> 640.78]  there's the the thing is they're starting so far behind right now like before they they tried really
[640.78 --> 644.20]  hard so they tried they got kind of close to be completely honest to what a lot of people were
[644.20 --> 649.92]  getting on a pc experience now they're starting so far behind at the start that by the time they catch up
[650.34 --> 655.14]  they'll all be so ridiculously far ahead that it will again not matter with that said the pace of
[655.14 --> 660.26]  development of pc hardware has slowed down a lot this is we've noticed that i mean there hasn't been
[660.26 --> 665.58]  a reason to upgrade your cpu in almost four years i'm not going to talk too much about it but the fact
[665.58 --> 672.34]  that i got under 30 fps average running with the like baller sauce card from nvidia at 2560 by 1600
[672.34 --> 678.92]  actually while it ran it very well in comparison to other cards i was still like i'm really not that
[678.92 --> 684.42]  impressed i want one that's like twice as good literally yeah and we're not seeing that same
[684.42 --> 689.10]  pace of development anymore but there's technical difficulties we did talk about that a little bit
[689.10 --> 695.04]  on last week's show yeah all right so we got a couple of our quick topics here before we jump into
[695.04 --> 698.90]  our guest segment which will be in about 10 minutes another quick thing i actually want to add about that
[698.90 --> 704.22]  previous topic was uh there's a quote saying the load screens isn't a bullet point that any gamers are
[704.22 --> 710.62]  going to be like sweet about uh sweet no load screens about why what speaking of no load screens
[710.62 --> 715.48]  though hold on yeah and yeah gamers care about no load screens like that was a huge thing in gta 5
[715.48 --> 719.94]  everyone was like yeah big initial load screen but then no none after that which is awesome um so
[719.94 --> 726.24]  speaking of load screens the playstation 4 has been confirmed uh with a teardown i think he's like
[726.24 --> 729.56]  their head of technical something or other i can't remember i don't think it's actually in here as a
[729.56 --> 736.24]  story but it's maybe it is maybe it doesn't anyway um so actually you know what control fps 4 because
[736.24 --> 740.96]  i thought maybe it was in here i'm not sure what you're talking about um playstation yeah no it's
[740.96 --> 745.50]  not in here anyway so they did an official teardown and what they revealed is that the two and a half
[745.50 --> 749.90]  inch drive inside can be replaced with any two and a half inch drive i thought they i thought we
[749.90 --> 757.42]  already i thought that's old news even an ssd no oh yes that's interesting so that's cool
[757.42 --> 762.84]  bye bye load screens bye bye see ya that's actually really interesting yeah i can't wait
[762.84 --> 769.50]  modding consoles yes one terabyte ssd in ps4 i mean you'd be spending twice as much on that ssd as you
[769.50 --> 775.64]  spent on the console in the first place but you'd be having again so anything that makes a console
[775.64 --> 781.92]  more like a pc is makes it better so i was really excited to hear about that that's really interesting
[781.92 --> 786.62]  i i had actually yeah i hadn't heard of that that is such an uncharacteristically sony
[786.62 --> 790.98]  modder friendly thing to do that i thought was uh that i thought was incredibly cool probably wasn't
[790.98 --> 798.48]  intentional well can we give them the benefit of the doubt here sure sure maybe you know i still
[798.48 --> 804.34]  don't really think it was intentional but but sure i'll give them benefit of the doubt all right
[804.34 --> 808.72]  we'll give them benefit of the doubt rapid fire topic all right rapid fire topic number one here
[808.72 --> 813.64]  are we going to do a twitter blitz before the guests uh yeah guys hit us with a few twitter
[813.64 --> 817.20]  questions we'll do a twitter blitz in the last five minutes before the guest but we have one of
[817.20 --> 823.46]  our rapid fire topics here did you know that the iphone 2g is a collector's item so the article here
[823.46 --> 830.54]  is from no idea how to pronounce this but twoo.com and it was posted on the forum by carl iskra
[830.54 --> 839.00]  and someone is trying to sell an iphone 2g for an asking price of that that that that two thousand
[839.00 --> 845.22]  dollars and there are folks asking as much as five thousand dollars for unopened units
[845.22 --> 852.74]  okay this is sealed new inbox yeah so this one's sealed new inbox for two grand now let's talk about
[852.74 --> 856.72]  the collector mentality a little bit for a second here because i think you and i both looked at this
[856.72 --> 862.68]  and went what are they high yeah but i sat down and thought about it for a little bit later and
[862.68 --> 868.32]  while i wouldn't spend two thousand dollars on any of these things i still go out and buy um very old
[868.32 --> 872.28]  school cartridge yeah like he bought a power glove not that long ago yeah and how much did you pay for
[872.28 --> 877.98]  that 20 bucks okay that's a really good deal yeah okay no i i'm not gonna spend two thousand dollars
[877.98 --> 883.08]  on anything no no not two thousand but would you pay okay for 30 bucks it was not it was under 50
[883.08 --> 888.96]  classic snes game let's talk like donkey kong country new in box what's that worth at to you
[888.96 --> 893.94]  personally to me i'd spend a bit on it not two freaking thousand dollars but more than it was
[893.94 --> 899.12]  worth when it was new probably right because i would say okay new in box donkey kong country got
[899.12 --> 903.00]  to be worth at least a few hundred bucks probably more i don't know if i'd spend because it's a
[903.00 --> 907.14]  classic on it but it's probably worth i'd probably pay a hundred for it like i'd pay more than retail
[907.14 --> 912.50]  so if you look at something like the iphone and kind of go okay well it a it revolutionized
[912.50 --> 917.48]  things i mean you look at how much original apple apple twos will go for if you if you can find an
[917.48 --> 926.02]  apple two that's you know mint condition their box like so much money so much money so it's kind of
[926.02 --> 930.34]  game-changing the only thing that bothers me about this is it really wasn't that long ago yeah
[930.34 --> 936.54]  and like that's the that's the problem i got no problem with collecting and i got no problem with
[936.54 --> 942.06]  paying more than sticker price like i can very clearly remember when that came out but this was like
[942.06 --> 947.80]  this was like five years ago i mean like i have i have clothing that's older than the iphone
[947.80 --> 951.18]  i have lots of clothing that's most of my clothing is older than the iphone
[951.18 --> 959.54]  that's funny yeah i that's that's what kind of blew my mind about it and yeah i don't know i
[959.54 --> 964.38]  understand the collector mentality but like jeez but jeez okay so this was posted by top war gamer on
[964.38 --> 970.48]  the forum uh bill gates says internet connectivity whoops doesn't mean much if you're dying of
[970.48 --> 977.16]  starvation and while i agree to a great extent because i i know this this came up a little while
[977.16 --> 982.72]  ago when google was planning their whole internet connected blimps floating over developing countries
[982.72 --> 988.00]  things so everyone could have connectivity um so it came up a little while ago him saying something
[988.00 --> 995.96]  similar but is it really fair to take shots at guys who are trying to improve the information
[995.96 --> 1002.72]  infrastructure in these regions yes food and yes disease control is important but we have to move
[1002.72 --> 1007.38]  forward in all these ways and a big part of the problem in many developing countries is lack of
[1007.38 --> 1016.16]  knowledge fear of things like uh vaccines for example is a very a huge obstacle to the people who are
[1016.16 --> 1021.30]  trying to give vaccines and clean water and give aid to these people so i mean while i don't
[1021.30 --> 1026.30]  necessarily think that every starving african child needs a laptop and an internet connection
[1026.30 --> 1032.46]  i think having community internet connection is critical but i also agree with them 100 percent
[1032.46 --> 1038.28]  that it is not a replacement for food clean water disease control and all these kinds of things but
[1038.28 --> 1043.20]  but a multi like i said in the notes but a multi-pronged approach is probably the best thing you can't
[1043.20 --> 1047.92]  just improve one thing at a time or else it'll take infinite amount of time a great way of looking
[1047.92 --> 1052.48]  at that is if you gave everyone all the food and then no water then it's not like you've actually
[1052.48 --> 1060.34]  helped them in any way they need food water shelter and and keeping oh this is gonna maybe sound brutal but
[1060.34 --> 1065.34]  like if you if you cure them all of malaria they still need to be able to develop their country and one of the
[1065.34 --> 1068.40]  fastest ways they're gonna be able to do that is being able to have access to the internet so they can
[1068.40 --> 1073.52]  learn things very quickly and work on developing the area around them i mean education is is something
[1073.52 --> 1078.56]  that we can all agree is important you know you look at building schools in africa or in other
[1078.56 --> 1084.08]  developing nations or continents i'm sorry africa's not a nation i know that trust me um so you look at
[1084.08 --> 1088.64]  building schools and you kind of go yeah that's really important and that's expensive so then yes
[1088.64 --> 1094.32]  internet access in my mind is important because we're not talking about you know playing angry birds
[1094.32 --> 1100.08]  or flash games on newgrounds.com we're talking about having access to to knowledge like research
[1100.08 --> 1105.12]  websites wikipedia all this kind of stuff so you can learn all right it might not be citable it's
[1105.12 --> 1108.48]  still helpful let's go ahead and have a look at what we've got for our twitter blitz we've got a few
[1108.48 --> 1115.28]  minutes here before we pull in steve dotto you want to bet it's all like r9 290 and 780 yeah yeah
[1115.28 --> 1122.88]  don't worry guys we will talk about it um yep first one first oh well second one sorry second one all
[1122.88 --> 1128.00]  right it's doing it's doing that thing where i can't scroll down because it's twitter and chrome
[1128.00 --> 1133.84]  for some reason just hates its life so i just gotta i just gotta wait i just gotta wait and be a
[1133.84 --> 1139.04]  patient guy we can do it verbally so um the second comment here which isn't quite on stream yet
[1139.92 --> 1148.72]  page unresponsiveness genius now i can't read it there we go all right oh wow did it go past oh okay
[1148.72 --> 1153.92]  here we go christopher go worth the wait for the 800 series in your personal opinion or splurge
[1153.92 --> 1158.88]  for the 780ti which may lose its value soon um that really depends on how you want to see things
[1158.88 --> 1162.16]  i'm probably going to be waiting for the 800 series just because i'm interested in the new
[1162.16 --> 1168.88]  architecture but the 780ti is a beast machine so i don't know this kind of stuff like it's always
[1168.88 --> 1172.64]  impossible because if you just wait for everything you could just be waiting for everything forever
[1172.64 --> 1180.08]  because things are released so quickly so wow yeah twitter is being worse than usual it's it's
[1180.08 --> 1185.68]  it's like actually a pro oh here we go okay age 220 still the best ai o cooler or is there something
[1185.68 --> 1190.48]  else um i believe there's a triple model but other than that yeah it's still about as good as it gets
[1190.48 --> 1195.60]  for a dual model i like the old unboxing intro cool uh do you think it's going to be long until amd
[1195.60 --> 1201.44]  comes out with a solution like g-sync they haven't talked about it at all so no idea but i really hope
[1201.44 --> 1206.56]  that they either license g-sync or come up with their own competing solution preferably i would
[1206.56 --> 1209.60]  like to see everyone using the same thing and there'll be a little bit more about this later
[1209.60 --> 1215.20]  when we talk about mantle versus g-sync versus physics and how i really feel it's unfair to the
[1215.20 --> 1220.96]  gamer that when they buy a game they actually can't have the complete experience no matter what hardware
[1220.96 --> 1226.24]  they have yeah without having like two pcs and then sitting and playing the game side by side at
[1226.24 --> 1230.24]  each of them well here i can see the physics take one step and then like slide over and take another step
[1230.24 --> 1238.80]  here i get true audio for better immersion like like you know what you could have if you played
[1238.80 --> 1243.04]  the whoa yeah yeah yeah a display that takes two inputs
[1245.36 --> 1252.40]  so you could actually overlay hi it wouldn't work trust me like keyboard mapping so you can play on two
[1252.40 --> 1256.40]  different machines at the same time and then the true audio so you have your headphones plugged into the
[1256.40 --> 1263.52]  one yeah best photo editing monitor for 200 to 300 dollars uh check out the asus pro art series
[1263.52 --> 1269.36]  although frankly for actual real color work especially if you're doing any printing sorry man
[1270.08 --> 1276.96]  10 bit uh which case in the one to 140 range should i get i'm using an h100 and planning to get a custom
[1276.96 --> 1283.76]  loop in the future you got me uh you can get an r4 fire in there yeah or um arc midi r2 would be a good
[1283.76 --> 1288.16]  choice if you're going custom water cooling the ps3 since day one had a replaceable hard drive that
[1288.16 --> 1292.96]  could be easily swapped well there you go great so the ps4 continues that proud tradition and apparently
[1292.96 --> 1299.20]  the ps3 one could be an ssd as well so there you go didn't know that wasn't super into consoles yeah
[1299.20 --> 1307.20]  it is it is what it is uh three must have free games and three must have paid games okay
[1307.20 --> 1314.24]  uh oh i think that was a question what are three of each okay what do you think about the new youtube
[1314.24 --> 1318.24]  comments oh trust me we'll be talking about that actually with our guest here in a moment
[1318.96 --> 1322.96]  first time watching from the uk just got a k70 with browns after watching your unboxing
[1324.16 --> 1329.12]  nice good job probably like the majority of our views on that if you watched it 35 000 times how's
[1329.12 --> 1336.72]  an a10 6800k with radeon doesn't matter for crossfire no no crossfire um do not run an apu with a graphics card
[1337.68 --> 1344.24]  okay let that sink in for a minute buy an apu that doesn't have as good of an onboard graphics card
[1344.24 --> 1353.44]  and buy a better graphics card pick up a 7770 there's no excuse for not just saving 30 bucks on the apu
[1353.44 --> 1360.80]  so the 6790k i think is coming in a couple weeks grab one of those grab a 7770 boom same price much
[1360.80 --> 1366.96]  better performance i really never recommend uh apu crossfire yet uh who are you guys rooting for
[1366.96 --> 1373.04]  in wcs finals i'll let you feel that i don't even know who's playing i don't follow pro gaming at all
[1373.04 --> 1379.04]  i'm with benching lately i haven't been oh yeah he's hardly slept this week yeah from the uk i want
[1379.04 --> 1384.56]  to get an r9290 but nvidia gtx 780 is tempting because of shadow play what to get is it worth the money
[1384.56 --> 1389.12]  well if you were planning to have a dedicated like capture pc or you were planning to buy an
[1389.12 --> 1395.92]  additional capture card like device then the 780 starts to really show its value with that in mind
[1395.92 --> 1400.48]  shadow play doesn't work with everything no open gl support uh there was something else that was like
[1400.48 --> 1407.36]  critical minecraft um doesn't support actually live streaming to twitch yet yet like it's not quite
[1407.36 --> 1412.08]  there yet so you know if you can wait a little bit longer then great we had some audio issues with it
[1412.08 --> 1416.88]  it but i don't know if that's gonna be a thing i had no idea it's in beta right now and we were
[1416.88 --> 1421.68]  using beta drivers we're using beta drivers pre-release drivers for the graphics card beta shadow
[1421.68 --> 1427.04]  play beta shadow play so we don't know all right yeah so let's call that it for that particular twitter
[1427.04 --> 1434.72]  blitz and let's bring on our guest steve we are bringing you in now welcome to the show how are you
[1434.72 --> 1441.12]  steve i'm doing great how are you guys we are fantastic so we've got a few great topics to discuss but
[1441.12 --> 1446.16]  i'd like to start with having you just introduce yourself to the audience if they haven't already
[1446.16 --> 1450.48]  heard of you and uh tell us about where where they can find you and what you're all about
[1451.44 --> 1457.44]  uh well for 15 years i hosted and produced uh dotto tech which was a nationally syndicated tv show here
[1457.44 --> 1461.68]  in canada so all of your international viewers are probably going who the heck is that and that's
[1461.68 --> 1467.20]  fair enough but most of the canadian viewers should or listeners should know who i am uh so it was a
[1467.20 --> 1471.20]  it was a how-to computer show back in the day like when we we showed people how to upgrade their
[1471.20 --> 1478.32]  modems from 14.4 to 28.8 it was awesome stuff and uh we did that for for a good long time and then uh
[1478.32 --> 1484.32]  stopped doing it a few years back and i've kind of shifted my emphasis now to online i've got a small
[1484.32 --> 1490.48]  by your standard youtube channel i still do my how-to stuff and uh radio show that we produce each week and i
[1490.48 --> 1495.20]  do a lot of public speaking talk about the social impact of technology and that kind of stuff so they can
[1495.20 --> 1501.92]  find me at dotto tech dot com or at youtube slash dotto tech all right now uh i've got a dotto tech
[1501.92 --> 1509.60]  season five episode here that i'm gonna go ahead and uh and and pull up hold on a second let me just
[1509.60 --> 1514.88]  let me just oh yeah i've been punked oh this this is great hold on hold on you guys you guys are gonna
[1514.88 --> 1529.28]  love this okay here we go oh my look at that computer awesome
[1532.88 --> 1536.80]  all right all right steve i'm not gonna i'm not gonna make you suffer too much i i hate watching
[1536.80 --> 1541.84]  old stuff of myself as much as as much as anyone does oh we lost sound when you did that unfortunately
[1541.84 --> 1548.00]  oh unfortunately it was fresh they lost sound okay well guys it's uh it's it's it's epic it's epic
[1548.00 --> 1555.04]  but um let's start with talking about some of the ways that new media has changed the way that you've
[1555.04 --> 1560.80]  seen interaction with audiences and change the way that you used to do things i mean for one thing
[1560.80 --> 1566.08]  the equipment required and the expense has decreased significantly since you first started up
[1571.84 --> 1582.16]  i don't hear steve right now we just talked we just what just connected and reconnected oh sorry
[1582.16 --> 1586.64]  guys we just uh disconnected and reconnected what wireless network are you on i can't change to the
[1586.64 --> 1591.20]  other one remember oh you can't change to the other one right that's fantastic okay so we'll have steve
[1591.20 --> 1598.24]  back in just a moment here so this is uh the most sort of brilliant thing ever that i'm super thrilled
[1598.24 --> 1607.76]  about right now okay so i've got a hot spot up go ahead and connect to me if you can here yeah i got it
[1608.40 --> 1619.12]  okay okay xperia yep i'll enter the password oh i think you missed there miss click good night
[1619.12 --> 1626.72]  i knew that one oh you have that memorized yeah wow okay i'm surprised
[1629.68 --> 1637.04]  all right so once we get connected here we should be good to go i think the uh
[1638.40 --> 1642.24]  stream actually went down for a little bit too nope we haven't dropped any frames okay
[1642.24 --> 1649.20]  so in theory we are still completely streaming 100 everything is streaming we just need to get steve
[1649.20 --> 1655.68]  back on here need to actually be on the internet on the laptop which would be super helpful uh
[1657.20 --> 1665.68]  wait what portable hotspot blah blah blah blah blah discoverable powersafe linus portable hotspot tips
[1665.68 --> 1672.64]  no internet access on the portable hotspot you have to be kidding me linus mobile configuration tips
[1673.68 --> 1678.32]  uh okay that could actually be a small problem so i'm going to get you to do a couple rapid fire
[1678.32 --> 1683.60]  topics while we get steve back i'm just going to pop my sim into another phone because i just
[1683.60 --> 1688.48]  discovered something about the xperia z1 that i'm incredibly not impressed about so it looks like
[1688.48 --> 1693.68]  it has a little bit of trouble sharing that 3g data in its default configuration so
[1693.68 --> 1699.20]  all right oh hey hey whoa are we back yep oh we're back we're back okay
[1700.48 --> 1704.24]  so just took a minute there all right experience you want you're safe i'm sure glad it's you guys
[1704.24 --> 1710.80]  doing that it's good to see it from the other side you should be me doing that yeah all right so
[1710.80 --> 1718.40]  steve welcome back to the show sit back and relax so speaking of inexpensive guys speaking of
[1718.40 --> 1724.72]  inexpensive equipment and the way that it uh has made this kind of broadcast more accessible um how
[1724.72 --> 1728.72]  do you how do you think that's really changed the dynamic even though it doesn't always work 100 of
[1728.72 --> 1736.48]  the time you know and it doesn't matter that it doesn't work 100 of the time it's so universal now
[1736.48 --> 1741.20]  you know a half hour tv show that we used to produce that you would have seen there there was about
[1741.20 --> 1746.64]  a total of about 35 people who touched that show from start to finish uh be it cameramen floor
[1746.64 --> 1751.44]  directors audio guys you know the whole team and it would cost us anywhere from the neighborhood of
[1751.44 --> 1757.44]  and we were really cost efficient we'd cost us 35 or 40 thousand dollars an episode to produce a
[1757.44 --> 1763.36]  half hour of content which there was what 22 minutes of real content and so five six product
[1763.36 --> 1770.24]  demos 20 40 000 bucks how does that sound as far as value compared to what you can produce now right or
[1770.24 --> 1774.72]  what we can produce just with a simple screencaster or you guys do with your with your weekly with
[1774.72 --> 1782.08]  your uh daily uh unboxing videos it's it's amazing when you talk about a budget like 30 40 000 i look
[1782.08 --> 1790.00]  at that and i go yeah that that will run linus tech tips for weeks like weeks upon weeks and hours upon
[1790.00 --> 1797.20]  hours of content and and we used to have the sponsors to support it because there was no there was no
[1797.20 --> 1801.28]  channel to do anything else so although the you know the quality and the technical issues you know
[1801.28 --> 1806.72]  they they aren't it what we produce today is not what we call broadcast quality for network television
[1807.28 --> 1812.88]  it's still the content and the message is just as valuable and it's just it's just far more democratic
[1812.88 --> 1817.12]  as far as getting it out but the audience has changed so much i mean you know we talk about all the
[1817.12 --> 1823.04]  changes in the in the economic model of sponsorship and streaming and you know how we how we fund these
[1823.04 --> 1828.56]  different products the bottom line is our our audiences changed from viewers who were passive
[1828.56 --> 1833.60]  and would sit down there and turn us on and watch us on tv to now they're now we have a relationship
[1833.60 --> 1839.20]  with them i mean you guys have this fantastic comment stream going live while you're broadcasting your
[1839.20 --> 1844.16]  show which means everybody's completely engaged you can have a conversation with them that to me is
[1844.16 --> 1849.84]  the most exciting part of the whole thing it's just it's there there's just extra layers of dynamics that
[1849.84 --> 1855.04]  really go far beyond whatever we lose as far as the odd technical glitch or the you know the fact
[1855.04 --> 1859.84]  that the audio isn't quite as good as it used to be so did you guys record an entire season of dotto
[1859.84 --> 1864.64]  tech at a time and then just have to kind of sit there and wait to figure out if anyone even liked
[1864.64 --> 1871.28]  it and then back to the drawing board for the next season oh why why would care if people liked it or
[1871.28 --> 1878.56]  not it's if the sponsors liked it that was what happened a little bit crass there but you know the bottom
[1878.56 --> 1883.36]  line was that was my customer was you know it was microsoft and it was semantic and it was adobe that
[1883.36 --> 1888.64]  was my customer now i did a good job of paying attention to what the viewers liked but that was
[1888.64 --> 1894.40]  a luxury that wasn't the essential part of the business uh we produced the show we would start in uh
[1895.20 --> 1900.48]  we would start production in august for delivery in september and it took us uh and so we would produce
[1900.48 --> 1906.16]  about two shows a week for until until just around christmas time to get our 13 shows in
[1906.16 --> 1913.44]  and uh between one and two shows per week and in a in a in a in a the way that i worked the shifts uh
[1914.24 --> 1919.68]  in the uh later days when we were at city tv in vancouver is we worked in a four-hour shift so in a
[1919.68 --> 1924.40]  four-hour shift i would always try and get about 25 minutes of content done which would give us
[1924.40 --> 1928.80]  a single show and we tried to work it out like that and then we had a couple of extra shifts
[1928.80 --> 1935.92]  overall so we would do it in about 13 13 days in studio to do 13 episodes wow it's it's so different a
[1935.92 --> 1943.04]  lot more a lot more prep i mean for us oh it is and we had teleprompters yeah oh it's you know
[1943.76 --> 1948.24]  in a lot of some of the skills are the same but the production the the production techniques are so
[1948.24 --> 1954.64]  different i mean things that we take absolutely for granted today i mean felt like we were breaking
[1954.64 --> 1960.64]  new ground back in the day when we first started doing our show in 1995 we were we were showing
[1960.64 --> 1967.60]  products like windows 95 in the mac os early days you know we would uh we actually had three broadcast
[1967.60 --> 1973.60]  cameras focused on a single lcd monitor that we'd figured out how to mirror the display and i mean
[1973.60 --> 1979.20]  we think nothing of mirroring a display today but in the in those days it's really cool the fact that
[1979.20 --> 1983.60]  we could take a video card and we could make the same image appear on two different devices at the
[1983.60 --> 1990.96]  same time and our first lcd display that we bought was around six thousand dollars for a seven and a
[1990.96 --> 1997.28]  half inch display that we would get but we only dealing with 640 by 480 resolution and then we had
[1997.28 --> 2002.56]  two cameras one locked off in a long shot in a full screenshot and another one that went in tight on
[2002.56 --> 2008.00]  the menus and followed the puck as i was doing my demos and i actually choreographed it with the camera
[2008.00 --> 2012.16]  guy on this huge camera it was a studio camera it's one of the ones that you see on you know in the old tv
[2012.16 --> 2016.64]  shows the camera weighed like 700 pounds on a pedestal right and he would actually move in and
[2016.64 --> 2024.00]  and and and dolly around on the screen you just use moving that huge camera just a microscopic amount
[2024.00 --> 2029.92]  to follow me in a close-up on the screen as i was showing a drop down menu to show how to save a file
[2029.92 --> 2036.56]  or change a font but but that was that was what that was what differentiated our show from the others
[2036.56 --> 2041.44]  is that you could see the screens and remember then we were in standard definition television this was all
[2041.44 --> 2045.60]  going out into standard definition with you know really low resolution out to screens i mean there
[2045.60 --> 2050.64]  was probably people watching on black and white tvs i'm not sure but it could have been uh and and at
[2050.64 --> 2055.68]  any rate you know so for us the that attention to detail and explanation that was what one of the
[2055.68 --> 2061.12]  things that set our show apart and gave us the legs to last for 15 years right so now it's completely
[2061.12 --> 2067.92]  different because if we don't we want every single day yeah we have to pump content and the other thing is
[2067.92 --> 2072.80]  we all can't really give much thought at all to what our sponsors think about things i mean some
[2072.80 --> 2079.36]  of our sponsors are guys like corsair uh intel um amd is actually we're going to start rolling ads for
[2079.36 --> 2085.92]  them uh starting in probably about a week or two and that doesn't mean that our show can't contain
[2085.92 --> 2093.04]  criticisms of these guys because they it absolutely has to the audience has gotten so savvy and they've got
[2093.04 --> 2098.40]  the ability to interact with you so quickly and interact with each other so well that if you were
[2098.40 --> 2105.28]  to say something that you know for whatever reason isn't true or somehow misleads them or you know blows
[2105.28 --> 2111.92]  blows sunshine up a sponsor's butt you will get destroyed immediately it's it's like game over for you the
[2111.92 --> 2115.44]  content creators have a completely different approach to how they interact with their audiences
[2115.44 --> 2123.84]  and and when you go back 20 years the world was not we didn't have that dialogue that's where that
[2123.84 --> 2131.04]  audience dialogue it creates much more accountability uh but but in those days uh you know we were we
[2131.04 --> 2136.72]  weren't quite the men world but i would go to my sponsors uh you know three four five months before
[2136.72 --> 2142.56]  we take the shows and we would be discussing what stories they wanted what stories they wanted to have
[2142.56 --> 2148.00]  promoted so i would know their product map you know a year in advance and i'd be under nda for them
[2148.00 --> 2152.40]  as far as what products were coming down the pipe and i had to deal with them i mean the thing is that we
[2152.40 --> 2157.12]  we established one thing i'm proud of is we established a lot of credibility in the space which i
[2157.12 --> 2161.68]  still maintain today right but a part of that credibility came from there was times when i had
[2161.68 --> 2165.60]  honest conversations with sponsors and saying i don't like this product i can't tell a good story
[2165.60 --> 2170.96]  about it i don't feel right about it and they always they always said yeah we get it and they didn't want to
[2170.96 --> 2176.56]  they didn't want to undermine the credibility of our product so we even though we were definitely
[2176.56 --> 2181.68]  bought and paid for the uh you know i made sure that i didn't do reviews but instead i showed how
[2181.68 --> 2186.72]  the technology fit in our lives so i could always add value to the technology that way and that's how
[2186.72 --> 2193.44]  we kind of skirted around that issue i mean i in some ways that was you know it was not it was nice to
[2193.44 --> 2198.96]  have just that one customer that i had to keep happy back in the day and so but in a lot of ways i think
[2198.96 --> 2202.48]  what you guys are doing is just as challenging now because you can make an honest mistake you
[2202.48 --> 2207.92]  can think something's cool or you can you can you know not fact check as well as you probably should
[2207.92 --> 2212.72]  but how can you when you're producing five or six shows a week and then make a little mistake and all
[2212.72 --> 2217.04]  of a sudden you know between the twittersphere and in everything else it gets completely blown out of
[2217.04 --> 2222.56]  proportion and you're all of a sudden playing defense in a in a in an area where you've got some
[2222.56 --> 2226.24]  people that like you some people that don't like you a lot of people that are jealous of you
[2226.24 --> 2230.64]  and they're just looking for weakness to come after you so you've got you've got some really
[2230.64 --> 2236.24]  incredible challenges as well it's a lot of fun though one thing actually that i noticed he said
[2236.24 --> 2240.64]  city coordinates with sponsors like four or five months beforehand like linus coordinates with
[2240.64 --> 2245.52]  sponsors sometimes like four or five hours beforehand it's like oh there's a wans show coming
[2246.32 --> 2251.12]  yeah i want to get all that sponsorship i mean we'll we'll receive we'll receive a new product we'll
[2251.12 --> 2256.08]  receive our briefing if we're lucky a week before it launches that's and then we'll have the product
[2256.08 --> 2261.60]  in hand with software that makes it work maybe three or four days beforehand sometimes we'll get
[2261.60 --> 2269.60]  a driver a day before it releases this is the world we live in today i mean i can't imagine i mean you
[2269.60 --> 2275.52]  you know you and i live in a youtube world where we do an awful lot with google and and i can't imagine
[2275.52 --> 2281.52]  a world like 15 years ago us talking about a product that was put out and never became anything
[2281.52 --> 2288.08]  but beta with zero technical support and zero documentation yet given out and been embraced by
[2288.08 --> 2294.72]  the whole world with with almost no support or no thought of support behind it and and i mean that's
[2294.72 --> 2298.96]  that's that's that's one of the most profound changes that we see is you know the the web delivery of
[2298.96 --> 2304.88]  tools like gmail or or like youtube i mean trying to figure out things on youtube to how to do anything
[2304.88 --> 2310.48]  that's of a technical nature it's just a voyage of discovery for each of us which by the way guys
[2310.48 --> 2317.04]  right you do some things wrong and viewers by the way don't worry we are talking with steve about the
[2317.04 --> 2321.20]  integration of google plus and youtube that's coming next anyway sorry go ahead steve
[2323.92 --> 2328.00]  but but well in in what you guys just went through with the technical glitch here
[2328.00 --> 2332.16]  you know i i guarantee you that this software that you're using i've never used it before but i bet
[2332.16 --> 2336.24]  you there's almost no documentation on it and there you know and there's in this probably you
[2336.24 --> 2341.52]  know you probably just kind of you you would say oh what happens if i click on this and you've gone
[2341.52 --> 2346.24]  through that whole process very often with it oops i shouldn't have clicked on that because bad things
[2346.24 --> 2352.16]  happen then well that never used to happen for us so it's uh it is a uh it's it's a much faster
[2352.16 --> 2356.80]  moving in world where you really have to be much lighter on your feet and uh and i also have a really
[2356.80 --> 2361.68]  thick skin because it's really easy to take a misstep all right let's talk about google plus and the way
[2361.68 --> 2368.96]  that youtube and google have crammed the integration of google plus down our throats on youtube the
[2368.96 --> 2374.24]  world's either number two or number one can never remember which one it is search engine um so basically
[2374.24 --> 2380.08]  for those of you who haven't been in the loop over the last couple days i'll i'll sync you up so google
[2380.08 --> 2386.80]  has been prompting us when we log into youtube periodically to change our names use our real names um
[2386.80 --> 2392.00]  this link to a google plus account and do all of these things for for actually quite some time now
[2392.00 --> 2398.40]  and up until now up until i believe it was yesterday for most people you could just click ignore for
[2398.40 --> 2402.48]  some reason uh steve's uh he's on continuous transmission it's picking up something in the
[2402.48 --> 2405.68]  background oh steve you got something in the background there i don't know what it is
[2406.40 --> 2412.32]  but uh hopefully hopefully it's my dog just ran through was that it ah okay it's better now okay anyway
[2412.32 --> 2418.88]  so now as i'm getting as of about no we're good as of about yesterday google plus is required in
[2418.88 --> 2426.08]  order to leave a comment on a youtube video so this is youtube google's sneaky underhanded way to go okay
[2426.08 --> 2430.88]  you want to join a giveaway on youtube you want to talk to your favorite content creator you want to do
[2430.88 --> 2434.56]  anything you want to interact you want to find someone who's wrong on the internet and correct them
[2435.28 --> 2439.92]  you will need a google plus account so steve let's hear your thoughts on this what's the impact here
[2439.92 --> 2452.00]  yeah i know you don't sound at all biased on it i ain't happy man i ain't happy i i'm not i'm not
[2452.00 --> 2457.36]  unhappy i think you know and it shows that i'm 30 years older than you or 25 years older than you
[2457.36 --> 2462.64]  it's the old guy syndrome some accountability has to be made on this damned internet it can't be this
[2462.64 --> 2469.68]  wild and open thing that it is but no really okay for me when i when i looked at when when i first
[2469.68 --> 2474.88]  saw community in my channel oh it was about a month ago that i first started getting a hint that this
[2474.88 --> 2479.28]  was coming myself yeah and they and they released community do you remember the day that you saw
[2479.28 --> 2484.56]  that little community badge in your in your in your in your youtube feed yeah i kind of went oh really
[2484.56 --> 2493.68]  it's coming eh i went oh really i didn't go oh really because it gave me an opportunity to be
[2493.68 --> 2500.64]  had to begin to have a dialogue with my viewer base because to me youtube subscriptions had always
[2500.64 --> 2506.80]  been nothing more than facebook likes as far as the as far as long-term value because i couldn't really
[2506.80 --> 2512.48]  talk to the people who were subscribing to my youtube channel i could deliver video to them but really the
[2512.48 --> 2517.20]  relationship was no different than what i had with viewers on tv i didn't have a real good you know they
[2517.20 --> 2521.84]  could post occasionally online but i didn't really know them and there wasn't an active conversation in
[2521.84 --> 2525.68]  in my channel now mine might be a little bit my experience might be a little different than yours
[2525.68 --> 2532.80]  so i would always try and drive people off of youtube wherever i could onto my onto my own blog
[2532.80 --> 2537.76]  uh... site so that i could capture their information into an email list so that i could have a conversation
[2537.76 --> 2542.64]  with them and at some point so that i could perhaps maybe sell them something down downstream because
[2542.64 --> 2548.48]  that's how i choose to make a living so this opportunity all of a sudden to see their real google plus
[2548.48 --> 2554.32]  profile to have a name attached people include them in a circle and now to be able to start to have a conversation with them
[2554.32 --> 2555.52]  in this channel
[2555.52 --> 2558.08]  that to me was really exciting and
[2558.08 --> 2564.72]  it it more than anything else i i didn't think this was an insult to the people uh... to the people's privacy who were
[2564.72 --> 2570.32]  so you know subscribing to our channel or chatting i thought this was the biggest in your face facebook move
[2570.32 --> 2572.64]  that google has done in a long time
[2572.64 --> 2579.28]  yeah one thing that i worry about he said there like uh... the older mentality like you shouldn't be able to hide behind things
[2579.28 --> 2582.08]  it also worries me though because if you say something that's an opinion
[2582.72 --> 2589.76]  um... even if it's a widely accepted opinion if someone disagrees with it they can find your google plus page and using certain things that they find on your google plus page
[2589.76 --> 2596.40]  they can find more information about you it's surprisingly easy to find someone's address to find someone's phone number to do all that kind of stuff nowadays
[2596.40 --> 2601.04]  with how connected everything is so that that little bit of anonymity while it carries in
[2601.04 --> 2604.56]  really annoying things like massive amounts of trolling and people fighting constantly
[2604.56 --> 2604.96]  i think
[2605.92 --> 2610.32]  also protects us from some possible issues like i don't want someone knocking on my door
[2610.32 --> 2613.68]  with a baseball bat because they're pissed off because of something i said on the internet
[2613.68 --> 2619.28]  yeah i mean and the other thing too for me is it's not necessarily about people who disagree with
[2619.28 --> 2622.56]  um unreasonable stuff like if you were to come out and say
[2622.56 --> 2626.40]  you know all sheep need to die and we should kill all the sheep
[2626.40 --> 2630.32]  or something along those lines and someone in your country
[2630.32 --> 2635.68]  you know or someone in another country disagree or agrees with you but in their country that's not a
[2635.68 --> 2641.36]  widely held opinion and even though maybe or even if you had a perfectly reasonable opinion like
[2641.36 --> 2646.40]  you know t-shirts that are made out of cotton are great but if in some country a t-shirt made out of
[2646.40 --> 2651.12]  cotton is illegal and someone there agrees with you and then all of a sudden they're being persecuted
[2651.12 --> 2657.12]  quick i'm sorry if if he says something it constantly picks something up in the background
[2657.12 --> 2661.20]  oh he says something it auto corrects to where his voice is and then he doesn't pick it oh yeah i
[2661.20 --> 2666.80]  think your mic's automatically adjusting gain um so when you don't say anything for a while it just
[2666.80 --> 2672.80]  tries to find you yeah so it raises the levels so okay so what about the privacy that does need to
[2672.80 --> 2679.36]  be protected just hum in the background lightly that sounds wonderful there's a you know that's
[2679.36 --> 2684.88]  that's that's that's you know i hadn't thought about it from that perspective to be honest you
[2684.88 --> 2692.96]  guys you guys have uh you know brought a different a different aspect into focus um and to be if from
[2692.96 --> 2699.12]  google's perspective if i was to speak for them i don't think that they care no frankly that's been
[2699.12 --> 2704.96]  very clear i think what they care about is the fact that they want people to sign up for a google plus
[2704.96 --> 2711.44]  account they want that they want to be able to give the content providers a sense of access to
[2711.44 --> 2715.52]  their community and it's all going to be about downstream monetization i mean the one thing we
[2715.52 --> 2722.16]  haven't seen in google plus is a monetization model for content publishers not within google plus we've
[2722.16 --> 2726.48]  seen it within youtube we've seen it within facebook we haven't seen it within google plus and i still
[2726.48 --> 2731.68]  don't necessarily see how it's exactly going to resolve through this move but it's another step down that
[2731.68 --> 2739.60]  road and uh so i i imagine that the community is it's i imagine that the reason that they've done
[2739.60 --> 2747.44]  it now is youtube is so powerful and so strong i can't imagine uh a startup network competing with
[2747.44 --> 2752.64]  it very easily right now and that's probably a part of the a part of their game plan is they they wanted
[2752.64 --> 2757.68]  to and you know push this out at a time when it was going to be difficult for somebody to have an option
[2757.68 --> 2764.64]  because really at the end of the day what are our options what is the consumer's option and what is
[2764.64 --> 2770.08]  our as a content provider's option are you going to start pushing through vimeo and say you know i can
[2770.08 --> 2775.60]  turn vimeo and you know are you going to reach your half a million subscribers through vimeo no we're you
[2775.60 --> 2781.76]  know we're we are tied at the hip to these guys now yeah and that's uh and that's one of the reasons
[2781.76 --> 2788.08]  that i object so much to the google plus integration because up until now i have had a choice
[2788.64 --> 2794.08]  how i want to engage with my viewers i have been able to say i want to engage with you on twitter
[2794.08 --> 2798.00]  or i've been able to say i want to engage with you by email steve quick say something
[2801.20 --> 2805.92]  just yes i'm going to talk right now good okay um i've i've been able to engage with them
[2805.92 --> 2810.72]  you want me to adjust the settings here on this at all uh let's just let's not worry about it for now
[2810.72 --> 2815.04]  let's just let's sort of get through here yeah um but okay so i've been able to choose how i want
[2815.04 --> 2819.76]  to engage with them because on my own website on twitter whatever else and my viewers have been
[2819.76 --> 2823.68]  able to choose how they want to engage with me and what youtube and google are doing is they're taking
[2823.68 --> 2832.96]  the choice away from us i think can you hear me still yeah oh yeah because i just adjusted one thing
[2832.96 --> 2843.52]  is that still working yeah yeah you're good good i set up push to talk i think okay um the the i it
[2844.08 --> 2850.64]  it'll be interesting to see if based on backlash if there is an opt-out provision for any sort of
[2850.64 --> 2855.04]  individual any of their channel partners because the where that's going to come from and what google
[2855.04 --> 2860.40]  will eventually listen to is not to the great unwashed google plus users they're going to listen to the
[2860.40 --> 2865.28]  content providers that they're making money from so the people like yourself who have a channel who
[2865.28 --> 2870.80]  are who are you know providing the content and providing the eyeballs into google into into youtube
[2870.80 --> 2879.52]  that google so desires so the pushback from you guys and from us and whether or not we uh ask for an
[2879.52 --> 2886.32]  opt-out option for our channels or if they're going to come up with a different a a privacy channel you
[2886.32 --> 2892.08]  know they've incorporated privacy into chrome you can browse the web in private yeah that's you know
[2892.08 --> 2897.36]  they understand they understand you know they they've got the ability to create privacy layers and
[2897.36 --> 2902.88]  they obviously understand those issues uh... so it's gonna you know as is always the case with google
[2902.88 --> 2907.52]  i mean the way that they do things is they put it out there float it listen to what's happening and
[2907.52 --> 2912.40]  then and then and then and then react to to what the reaction of the of the marketplace is you know
[2912.40 --> 2916.16]  they're very different from the old school companies the apples and the microsoft that tell you the
[2916.16 --> 2920.80]  way that you should be doing things they're very you know they're very they're very reactive they'll
[2920.80 --> 2924.48]  put it out float it for a little while see what happens because they're they you know they can pull
[2924.48 --> 2929.68]  it they could pull it it wouldn't shock me if in three months from now it was pulled back and we
[2929.68 --> 2934.96]  didn't see it again for another three months after that and it came back in another form i would be
[2934.96 --> 2940.80]  very surprised if they do that because particularly on youtube they have taken quite a um we're gonna put
[2940.80 --> 2946.00]  it out there and you're gonna like it approach and they listen to even content creators my size so i think
[2946.00 --> 2952.88]  in terms of sheer subscriber base i'm around number 1300 on the youtubes which is pretty darn
[2952.88 --> 2959.76]  respectable and yet i have absolutely no voice i have no contact with anyone at google or youtube
[2959.76 --> 2965.92]  and i am basically completely ignored i will either like it or i will leave and i will suffer because of
[2965.92 --> 2972.64]  the way again i am tied to the hip um to google so we see this happening even more now though with with
[2972.64 --> 2976.32]  the closed garden that they have on the mobile side and with the basically closed garden that they
[2976.32 --> 2981.76]  have on youtube now like they're beginning to just ignore all and tread forward and it's not their
[2981.76 --> 2986.24]  previous mentality and i don't know how it's going to turn out for them so i'll see how that goes but in
[2986.24 --> 2992.80]  the meantime i'd like to shift gears over to um one of my favorite topics which is microsoft and chat
[2992.80 --> 3000.48]  clients and how they are absolutely destroying skype what are they doing oh they scared the heck out of
[3000.48 --> 3006.40]  me this last couple of weeks with this with this ill-conceived concept that we're going to eliminate
[3006.40 --> 3011.60]  the ability to be able to record from within skype i don't know you know i don't know how often you use
[3011.60 --> 3016.80]  that feature but i record many of my radio interviews most of my radio interviews i record from my home
[3016.80 --> 3022.16]  studio where i am right now using skype and call recorder so all of a sudden having to look at some other
[3022.16 --> 3026.64]  option was just ridiculous you know what it seems it seems they are bound and determined to make
[3026.64 --> 3034.96]  google talk and to make facebook chat uh the preferred avenues of talk of of of chat it they seem to like
[3034.96 --> 3041.52]  those that they seem to like those platforms a lot they certainly but this is this is when you get a
[3041.52 --> 3049.84]  cross of cultures when you get a uh an ingrained culture as deeply and as as insular as microsoft
[3049.84 --> 3056.72]  i mean you have to figure microsoft is an incredibly dysfunctional company from day one from the from
[3056.72 --> 3062.72]  in the last ten years because they've had to go through a a corporate catharsis which goes from
[3062.72 --> 3067.68]  it's which basically says we've got to kill off our cash cow we've got to take and we've got to move
[3067.68 --> 3073.04]  away from monolithic operating systems and apps to an online world which means we have to kill the thing
[3073.04 --> 3079.92]  that made us great and that is a really difficult thing to to to kind of get around you know and so
[3079.92 --> 3087.36]  within and they didn't do it they did it by siloing by setting one division against another and that you
[3087.36 --> 3091.28]  know i'm sure there's gonna be some fascinating business books written about the battles that went
[3091.28 --> 3096.08]  on and the resignations and the bloodbaths that happened as a result of that but you know you still
[3096.08 --> 3101.44]  had managers who were bonused on windows performance and in office performance who are going into meetings
[3101.44 --> 3105.60]  with people from the live division who were bound and determined to kill them i mean could you imagine
[3105.60 --> 3111.36]  the dynamics of those sorts of of you know and they work for the same company so it that company then
[3111.36 --> 3117.76]  when you when you set that against that company acquiring a loosey-goosey group like skype who just
[3117.76 --> 3121.68]  kind of you know you know it's like they they it's it's almost like the product was built while they
[3121.68 --> 3126.48]  were stoned right i mean they're oh we're gonna do this we're gonna do that we're not gonna make it easy
[3126.48 --> 3130.32]  for anybody to find anything but it's gonna do this and all of a sudden everybody's talking and we all love
[3130.32 --> 3136.32]  each other let's hug let's hug and you know so you got this you got this integration of skype now
[3136.32 --> 3142.96]  coming into this into this into this entity that is microsoft and it's no surprise that it's a you
[3142.96 --> 3148.64]  know i can't say the word but it's no surprise that it's clustered yeah and and i think we're seeing the
[3148.64 --> 3153.76]  result we're seeing you know straight-laced managers being inserted start start an institute command and
[3153.76 --> 3160.88]  control and uh and the result is we we just see a company we we see up what was a not necessarily a
[3160.88 --> 3168.16]  great product but a great uh a great integration starting to starting to circle the drain a little
[3168.16 --> 3173.92]  bit i mean thank god for the baby boomers coming on online and the old people because they love skype
[3173.92 --> 3177.76]  and they haven't quite figured out the google thing yet so that's what's keeping them going right now
[3177.76 --> 3182.16]  i mean the thing about skype for us is you you asked how often we use the recording feature not at
[3182.16 --> 3186.40]  all we can't use skype in fact i think you did want to call in today with skype and i'll explain
[3186.40 --> 3192.64]  why we can't use it it's because there's an exploit in skype that allows anyone who knows your skype id
[3192.64 --> 3198.24]  or the skype id of someone you're talking to and then can therefore find out your skype id can actually
[3199.12 --> 3205.52]  perform a ddos attack on your ip address making it so that we were losing our streams in the middle of
[3205.52 --> 3210.96]  our streams we were getting ddos because of a skype exploit when we were using skype so we have
[3211.44 --> 3217.36]  a zero skype policy as a company now there is no skype no skype is to be used anywhere in this building
[3217.36 --> 3223.92]  um oh and so your your your issues with our of a pure technical nature the fact that you haven't
[3223.92 --> 3230.48]  they haven't they haven't got their act together as a trusted provider i mean msn was a better framework
[3230.48 --> 3236.64]  than skype for our purposes and we're talking technology that's you know what i was in high
[3236.64 --> 3243.12]  school so we're talking technology that's over 10 years old at this point wow wow that's that's
[3243.12 --> 3247.76]  interesting i have to say you know just you know just on it as a complete aside i was watching the
[3247.76 --> 3253.04]  live stream before we came on and i was blown away by the quality of the live stream you know for all
[3253.04 --> 3258.32]  the little issues we have in the back end of making this thing work my gosh that's a that's a nice clean
[3258.32 --> 3263.12]  feed that's coming through on your guys on your guys stuff that's pretty cool thank you thank you we've uh
[3263.12 --> 3268.16]  we've spent a lot of time improving it over the last uh quite quite a while all right now we have
[3268.16 --> 3274.72]  one more topic for steve before he goes and guys stay tuned because you are about to steve keep an eye
[3274.72 --> 3280.08]  on the uh on the chat on the chat thing there because this is going to be kind of hilarious steve has the
[3280.08 --> 3287.60]  least um the least popular opinion on the entire internet about the xbox one and microsoft's move
[3287.60 --> 3293.60]  back back backpedaling from making it an entertainment system and going okay no no no no
[3293.60 --> 3300.08]  no we're focused on gaming we're focused on gaming so steve you you wish they had gone forward with
[3300.08 --> 3306.32]  this give me the baby boomers perspective compared to the younger gaming audience which is what we
[3306.32 --> 3310.80]  typically cater to let's hear it and guys just just hear them out hear them out okay here we go
[3310.80 --> 3318.56]  well it's it's it's i think the the new xbox is a phenomenal piece of technology and it's not a
[3318.56 --> 3325.28]  gaming box it does gaming but it's a it's it's the hub of a home entertainment system if microsoft
[3325.28 --> 3331.36]  wants to own the living room and own the core of the entertainment hub in in the households they've
[3331.36 --> 3337.12]  got they've got a they had to take this product and they had to position it first and foremost as your
[3337.12 --> 3341.20]  as your entertainment center they had to talk about the fact you can you know all of the all
[3341.20 --> 3345.44]  the stuff that might seem to be completely low-hanging fruit as far as a lot of your audience goes but
[3345.44 --> 3350.48]  everything from netflix integration to streaming my music through it to the fact that i can do
[3350.48 --> 3355.92]  skype integration and talk to my family at christmas time the wide you know the the uh connect the
[3355.92 --> 3361.76]  camera the that the fact that you could create presence on it those are stories that baby boomers don't
[3361.76 --> 3368.64]  understand they can do off of their high def tv and off of their living room and yeah can you play
[3368.64 --> 3373.76]  phenomenal games too yes you can but most people over 50 aren't that concerned about playing those
[3373.76 --> 3379.68]  games we're concerned about the community the programming the conversational aspects xbox is
[3379.68 --> 3383.76]  going to sell to gamers it's a great box that's going to sell the gamers you guys are going to gobble
[3383.76 --> 3388.48]  it up and you're going to dissect it and you're going to talk about the nuances of that it's you know i
[3388.48 --> 3396.72]  got eight more you know you know it's eighteen percent faster playing call of duty 74 space blaster
[3396.72 --> 3401.12]  edition and it's you've got all of those you know you guys are going to discuss those things and
[3401.12 --> 3404.64]  you're going to it's going to sell to that market that's not the market they have to worry about if
[3404.64 --> 3409.60]  they want to grow if they want to really become the dominant player in marketplace they had to reach
[3409.60 --> 3414.72]  out to me they had to reach out to my marketplace and tell me because i think i should have it in my
[3414.72 --> 3419.28]  living room whether or not i want ever want to play a game on it and if i do decide to play a game on it
[3419.28 --> 3427.52]  great but it does so many other things the living room is a quagmire of pieces of crap all that talk
[3427.52 --> 3432.96]  to each other or don't talk to each other you know streaming you know netflix streaming through i i i i
[3432.96 --> 3438.96]  laugh now because when i was a kid my dad would holler who flushed the toilet every time he was in
[3438.96 --> 3443.12]  the shower because the cold water would you know the hot water would scald him all of a sudden
[3443.12 --> 3448.48]  and now it's who's street who's uploading a file because the netflix stops the delivery we just don't
[3448.48 --> 3455.20]  get it we need we need one system that we can have in place that feeds the that feeds our entertainment
[3455.20 --> 3460.40]  complex our personal entertainment complex and xbox should have been that that's what they should
[3460.40 --> 3465.76]  have led with so here you can now they can hammer me yeah we'll let we'll let the hate flow because
[3465.76 --> 3469.68]  and i think the hate might keep flowing because there are a couple things you said that i actually
[3469.68 --> 3475.12]  do agree with um xbox one was going to be a gaming console regardless it was going to run games all
[3475.12 --> 3480.96]  of those things but i think they had to be a little bit more careful about and while they had to be a
[3480.96 --> 3486.96]  little bit more careful about the branding um and they shouldn't have necessarily made their their live
[3486.96 --> 3492.48]  internet stream that all the gamers were going to be watching and not not their parents well they
[3492.48 --> 3495.52]  shouldn't have made that all about the home entertainment system they should have done some
[3495.52 --> 3502.00]  of their other marketing about the home entertainment aspect so for example if they were to do a print
[3502.00 --> 3506.48]  ad that should be about the home entertainment system they should have marketed because we read
[3506.48 --> 3511.76]  magazines because the older people are going to actually read print whereas the younger people won't
[3511.76 --> 3517.76]  and looking at it from my mom's perspective if she were to buy one entertainment device for the family
[3517.76 --> 3524.80]  she would buy the one that seems to do things that she wants but why not release like xbox like xbox gt
[3524.80 --> 3530.96]  like xbox one gt and xbox one ht because that complicates things you want the idea is you want to
[3530.96 --> 3534.96]  build a platform but if you're building a platform that works for everything it's not going to be as
[3534.96 --> 3538.64]  good at doing all of those things but that's life which is already known you have a cell phone how much
[3538.64 --> 3543.20]  slower it is you have a cell phone does it have a camera on it yeah well there you go i mean that's the
[3543.20 --> 3546.88]  future but your argument is completely invalid because it sucks at gaming we've figured that out
[3546.88 --> 3552.32]  every they've been using footage from a ps4 to show up yes yes define okay and that's that's true but
[3552.32 --> 3558.16]  that is because it's clearly insignificant sony's implementation of the same hardware is better
[3558.16 --> 3561.76]  yeah that's that's all that happens because they're diverting so much of the xbox one to be able to do
[3561.76 --> 3566.72]  other things so while microsoft may have jumped the gun on this and while it might not work
[3566.72 --> 3572.56]  i do agree the thing i agree with that steve said is that they had to try because the thing that we've
[3572.56 --> 3577.04]  talked about before is i can you actually mute steve because i'm going to talk for a bit here and the
[3577.04 --> 3583.44]  the hiss is the hiss is coming the thing that i agree with is that microsoft had to try this and the
[3583.44 --> 3588.16]  reason for that is because what you and i already agree about is this is probably the last generation
[3588.16 --> 3596.16]  of dedicated console hardware so what the game is now is who can build the platform that other devices
[3596.16 --> 3601.28]  will run on in the future well i'm sorry no no yeah but you have to you have to build like the platform
[3601.28 --> 3605.68]  has to be a software ecosystem that people buy into it has to be xbox marketplace it has to be
[3605.68 --> 3610.48]  skype it has to be this it has to be that you have to get that box in there under the guise of being
[3610.48 --> 3614.16]  a gaming machine you have to get people used to using it and then you have to integrate it with
[3614.16 --> 3619.12]  something else and all that could have been fine but they could have released two versions they could
[3619.12 --> 3623.28]  have released two modes you could go into like computer mode and then enables all these things or if you
[3623.28 --> 3627.04]  go into game mode it disables all these things yeah they have constant connectivity for everything but
[3627.04 --> 3631.52]  the here's the problem is that that won't appeal to my mom she can't figure out how to change the
[3631.52 --> 3637.12]  mode on anything so have it in home theater mode stock even even have a giant button on a
[3637.12 --> 3640.00]  tv controller the kids will come along and they'll play a game and they'll forget you you are not
[3640.00 --> 3644.80]  understanding older people i understand my mom i know your mom is your mom is if it comes with a tv
[3644.80 --> 3651.44]  clicker which it doesn't if it did and there was a giant green xbox button in the middle yes that said like
[3651.44 --> 3656.64]  mode okay my aunt and my mom neither of them can figure that out trust me well then they shouldn't
[3656.64 --> 3662.00]  buy an xbox but that's that's not the point microsoft wants them to buy an xbox it's too complicated
[3662.00 --> 3666.16]  for them to be able to use it already if that's the case and that may be true but what i'm all i'm
[3666.16 --> 3671.52]  saying that i agree with is that they had to try they had to try because sony has every opportunity
[3671.52 --> 3676.48]  their implementation of it then failed okay aside from that i'm not saying it didn't fail i'm saying they had
[3676.48 --> 3683.04]  to try because sony has an opportunity because they own actual tv manufacturing to integrate into
[3683.04 --> 3687.60]  a tv later so they tried and they reverted so is that bad they tried and they reverted they tried
[3687.60 --> 3692.96]  and failed and reverted they didn't try and succeed that isn't a failure so we can agree it's a failure
[3692.96 --> 3697.44]  but i think they had to try that's all i'm trying to say i'm okay with them trying they just really
[3697.44 --> 3704.40]  sucked at trying okay i'm gonna unmute so yeah yeah bring bring back steve and i'm still i'm bleeding here
[3704.40 --> 3710.88]  i'm bleeding here old old fat guys wrong the one guy i want i'm hoping he friends me on facebook and
[3710.88 --> 3717.12]  comes over the guy that keeps saying fart because i i want to be his friend um i i i think that they
[3717.12 --> 3722.96]  i think that you muting me basically undermined any any credibility that i had they seem to think that
[3722.96 --> 3730.00]  that was a a big thing and uh oh don't swear please don't swear boys uh so here's the thing here's
[3730.00 --> 3734.24]  here's where you guys are making a big mistake though as well since i've already got the hate on from
[3734.24 --> 3740.16]  your from your from your constituency uh or sorry your peeps there i talked is that is that you
[3740.16 --> 3745.20]  speaking up sorry the only reason i muted you was because the uh the hiss kept getting louder and
[3745.20 --> 3750.80]  louder and louder yeah i didn't i didn't mean to turn you off at all okay i it doesn't bother me at all
[3750.80 --> 3756.72]  good the fart guy's back now listen the thing that you guys are missing here which is crucial in
[3756.72 --> 3761.76]  everybody that's saying that you know i'm this this dinosaur that doesn't get it i'm not talking about
[3761.76 --> 3767.84]  mom who can't control the pv doesn't know how to turn on her pvr and turn off her pvr or the person
[3767.84 --> 3773.60]  who's technically intimidated by the technology that's not who xbox should have been marketed to
[3773.60 --> 3778.48]  it should have been marketed to the moderately competent technical baby boomers like myself
[3778.48 --> 3784.32]  who want to integrate the full the full system i'm happy to have a system at the heart i do have
[3784.32 --> 3789.84]  to do some configuration on that ties into the internet that ties into the online services that ties in
[3789.84 --> 3796.64]  to the to video ties into gaming ties into ties into social networking i'm looking for that box
[3797.20 --> 3802.16]  and that box happens to be a kick-ass gaming system too which is fantastic but microsoft if
[3802.16 --> 3807.12]  they've given me that message if they deliver that message to that group they could have grown their
[3807.12 --> 3810.64]  market faster i'm not saying that it's not going to be a great uh gaming system and all that sort of
[3810.64 --> 3815.52]  thing i'm talking about their strategy of launching it as a gaming system first and that being the first
[3815.52 --> 3819.52]  thing out of their mouth because the gamers knew it was going to be great they were waiting for it they were
[3819.52 --> 3826.16]  going to buy it regardless they had an opportunity to generate a whole new market out of me out of my
[3826.16 --> 3833.12]  people and growing and becoming the de facto standard in the kit in the living room to to my community
[3833.12 --> 3839.36]  that was my argument all right well guys i think we're gonna we're gonna probably we're gonna probably
[3839.36 --> 3843.92]  sort of move on to our next topic i just realized it's 5 45 already steve we've kept you for a full extra
[3843.92 --> 3849.36]  15 minutes but uh thank you again for joining us on the show those i was on mute though let's face it
[3850.80 --> 3856.08]  sorry man sorry man uh so it was a pleasure want to just do sort of uh let them know where they can
[3856.08 --> 3860.24]  find you in the meantime and more importantly maybe near where their parents can find you and get some
[3860.24 --> 3864.16]  tips on technology i'm not sure we should i'm not sure we should be giving out any of my information
[3864.16 --> 3871.04]  anymore now looking at the feed here but yeah dotto tech dot com dial is dropped by and i'm at dotto
[3871.04 --> 3874.96]  tech on twitter so i'm sure that my i'm sure my quote score is going to go up with all of the
[3874.96 --> 3878.80]  mentions they don't look for whether they're positive comments or not but uh it's been a
[3878.80 --> 3883.92]  pleasure guys and and and i'm really you know uh one one last kind of personal thing sure is
[3884.56 --> 3889.12]  we when we when i met your first line you know i kind of looked at you and i said that was me 20
[3889.12 --> 3893.92]  years ago what you're doing now i i think i kind of broke ground in network television and getting
[3893.92 --> 3898.48]  technology on network television 20 years ago and i was very proud of the fact that i had a team that i
[3898.48 --> 3902.56]  relied on and we and we just basically read what was happening in the marketplace we worked within
[3902.56 --> 3906.96]  it and moved the ball downfield well you picked up that ball and you've carried it way downfield and
[3906.96 --> 3911.04]  i and i congratulate you i think it's i think it's i think you're doing a great job and and thanks for
[3911.04 --> 3916.32]  having me on it it's been an honor thank you very much all right thanks steve all right now i'm gonna
[3916.32 --> 3922.72]  address one thing uh sort of here here now that now that our guest segment is over and that is
[3922.72 --> 3930.24]  how microsoft could have pulled this off because there was no need for them to backpedal on the
[3930.24 --> 3937.28]  entertainment system messaging if they had delivered a couple of things number one is if they hadn't
[3937.28 --> 3941.76]  pissed off the gamers if they hadn't said look yeah you're gonna need online account this you're gonna
[3941.76 --> 3946.40]  need this you're gonna need that because i don't even disagree that online downloading of games and online
[3946.40 --> 3950.48]  registration of games is a bad thing but you should have been able to sell them to other people and
[3950.48 --> 3956.40]  re-gift them through the online system rather than necessarily relying on a disc to gift things and
[3956.40 --> 3962.48]  and all of that noise so they could have succeeded if they didn't piss off the gamers and they still
[3962.48 --> 3966.80]  could have delivered all of this messaging about tv and pvr and skype and all that stuff number two
[3966.80 --> 3975.52]  is the xbox one had to be slightly better hardware wise than the ps4 it is not like the technology from
[3975.52 --> 3980.80]  amd didn't exist okay throughout the entire development life cycle of the xbox one microsoft
[3980.80 --> 3986.48]  could have gone oh amd okay that's what you're showing us now we want double that they could have
[3986.48 --> 3992.80]  delivered a better piece of hardware if they'd been willing to do what the console guys have always done
[3992.80 --> 3997.52]  in the past just take a little bit and take a bit of a hit up front because both sony and microsoft
[3997.52 --> 4002.40]  have said look we're profitable from day one on ps4 and xbox one if they'd been willing to take a hit again
[4002.40 --> 4007.20]  in order to push their agenda of owning the living room they could have delivered all the messaging
[4007.20 --> 4010.88]  they want because the xbox one pre-orders are getting cancelled because the performance isn't
[4010.88 --> 4016.96]  as good if microsoft's messaging was all about how great it is as an entertainment system and your
[4016.96 --> 4021.20]  mom's gonna love it too and they were also delivering kick-ass gaming performance like just
[4021.20 --> 4025.60]  as fast or faster just as fast or faster and the exclusive title and all the things that gamers
[4025.60 --> 4030.16]  don't need microsoft to tell them because they are like steve said they already know about it anyway
[4030.16 --> 4033.68]  they're already on the internet finding out everything there is to know about xbox one
[4033.68 --> 4039.12]  if that stuff had been good this would have been a huge success if there's if additional features
[4039.12 --> 4043.28]  are not bad if they don't conflict with other features so if they brought in all this home
[4043.28 --> 4047.44]  theater stuff and experience stuff and it didn't affect the gaming side at all it would have been
[4047.44 --> 4052.16]  fine i would have no problems there is still a huge unknown here and that is how microsoft's cloud
[4052.16 --> 4056.72]  compute is going to help the gaming experience but it's gonna have latency and this and that i know but
[4056.72 --> 4060.48]  but the debate we're about to have is about an unknown all i said is it's an unknown yeah yeah
[4060.48 --> 4064.96]  that's it you're not wrong at all but it's already there's already been developers saying that they
[4064.96 --> 4069.44]  don't necessarily want to touch it because they're scared of a massive amount of their audience not
[4069.44 --> 4073.44]  being able to utilize and there's that and then there's also that whole conversation about how it
[4073.44 --> 4077.84]  took eight years to figure out how to leverage sell maybe it takes eight years before the infrastructure
[4077.84 --> 4083.04]  blah blah blah leveraging this and maybe four years in xbox one absolutely smokes ps4 who knows because of
[4083.04 --> 4087.68]  that infrastructure we don't know it's an unknown but microsoft had an opportunity to just put a
[4087.68 --> 4092.16]  better piece of hardware in your living room and i think things could have gone very differently yep
[4092.16 --> 4098.08]  definitely if if yeah if they put enough beef behind it to actually support the system that they wanted
[4098.08 --> 4103.68]  to release it would have been fine no one could really complain when saying oh well the xbox one is
[4103.68 --> 4107.60]  considerably faster so it can support all these different systems and it's still better at gaming
[4108.64 --> 4111.92]  then they could also justify their higher price tag all right let's talk about things that are
[4111.92 --> 4117.68]  legitimately better at gaming moving on to actually no first let's talk about our sponsor squarespace
[4118.24 --> 4123.12]  so guys you can visit squarespace.com slash i almost forgot to i try to do the sponsor after the guest
[4123.12 --> 4130.72]  segment you can visit squarespace.com and use offer code linus11 so that is linus11 for november and you
[4130.72 --> 4135.52]  can get your free trial of squarespace which is the easy way they have tons of templates i think they're up to
[4135.52 --> 4141.60]  over two dozen templates now for different websites that you can create whether it's a store or a blog or just
[4141.60 --> 4146.16]  any kind of information about you you just want to create a site dedicated to being a brony go for
[4146.16 --> 4149.92]  it you can do that on squarespace it is very straightforward they take care of all the hosting
[4149.92 --> 4154.88]  for you it's completely dynamic so if i were to head over to or if you were to go to linusmediagroup.com
[4154.88 --> 4159.44]  that is a squarespace driven site we've tried hammering it during the stream it doesn't go down because
[4159.44 --> 4164.32]  like i said it's dynamic if you buy an entire year subscription they actually throw in a domain for you
[4164.32 --> 4171.04]  and that 10 off is for a subscription but you also get a free trial so speaking of free trial
[4171.04 --> 4176.08]  squarespace reached out to me and they said hey linus um hey we wanted to correct you from last week
[4176.08 --> 4180.08]  because you didn't know how much squarespace cost per month it's eight dollars and i was like oh thank
[4180.08 --> 4184.64]  you for that sorry i i think i said like ten dollars or something like that so it's only eight dollars
[4184.64 --> 4192.96]  anyway and they said they wanted to give away a free year of squarespace by asking listeners to tweet in
[4192.96 --> 4199.28]  their trial sites so head over to squarespace pick up a trial create a website and then tweet your
[4199.28 --> 4205.44]  trial site to hashtag linus squarespace hashtag linus squarespace we should have created a little
[4205.44 --> 4210.24]  text thing for this but don't worry i'll link it in the video description hashtag linus squarespace and
[4210.24 --> 4215.52]  you will be entered into a random draw to win your site for a year and you can do whatever you want with
[4215.52 --> 4220.08]  it at that point and then you can talk about how great it is or whatever else but there you go guys
[4220.08 --> 4225.28]  there's an incentive to go for a trial squarespace.com slash linus actually they prefer if i don't say
[4225.28 --> 4231.60]  slash linus i think but whatever squarespace.com offer code linus 11 we use it we like it does work
[4231.60 --> 4236.88]  yeah i think it works but i don't know 100 i think they prefer if you don't use it or something i can't
[4236.88 --> 4240.00]  remember anyway see they're gonna watch this now they're gonna be like what are you doing
[4240.64 --> 4243.68]  why is he even talking about this you keep saying all the wrong things why do you keep saying all the
[4243.68 --> 4248.00]  wrong things linus you're less professional than everyone else we deal with so we should get the twitter
[4248.00 --> 4252.96]  moving on these next two topics yeah immediately all right so uh how about this for our question
[4257.76 --> 4261.52]  yeah because they're okay they're both in my opinion the most important for the teams because
[4261.52 --> 4266.56]  they're both a big deal but we want to hear on twitter guys at linus tech on twitter which was
[4266.56 --> 4274.80]  more important as a graphics card launch radeon r9 290 or gtx 780 ti so for those of you who aren't
[4274.80 --> 4283.68]  super familiar r9 290 is a 399 card so it's kind of value enthusiast grade okay that performs almost
[4283.68 --> 4291.84]  as well as anything else out there with the exception of the after 290 launched nvidia retort with the gtx 780
[4291.84 --> 4300.32]  ti which outperforms everything else particularly after overclocking but is a 700 card ish so it's very
[4300.32 --> 4306.72]  very expensive but it's now the king it's the reigning champion for a single gpu card so we want
[4306.72 --> 4310.80]  to hear what is more important while we take a little bit of time to discuss them so really on r9 290
[4312.00 --> 4319.28]  it blew me away i'm i'm probably more excited for the future of this card than many cards that i've ever
[4319.28 --> 4324.80]  seen before because it gets crazy hot and it could use more power so once we get aftermarket designs that
[4324.80 --> 4330.88]  cool it the heck down because as with this card literally you get one degree cooler it will go
[4330.88 --> 4338.24]  faster yeah like every degree is actually worth fps because you'll probably get a better cooler that
[4338.24 --> 4342.56]  brings it colder but then you'll be able to clock it higher to max it out again and it'll just go even
[4342.56 --> 4348.64]  faster because this card is just endlessly you know what we should do we're i mean we're waiting for a
[4348.64 --> 4353.60]  water block for the r9 290 series from coolants as soon as they have something available that's going to
[4353.60 --> 4357.84]  be in the mail we're ready to rock with that but you know what we should do it's getting cold here
[4358.80 --> 4362.80]  we should take this outside i thought you were going to say revitalize the chiller we should find
[4362.80 --> 4367.76]  oh we could we oh no because we don't have a block yet um but if we were to take this baby outside
[4368.32 --> 4374.56]  and find out what she can do i should go try and like overclock outside at like 3 a.m or something
[4374.56 --> 4381.68]  yeah that could be fascinating so anyway that's where we're at on 290 is it's interesting but the power
[4381.68 --> 4386.72]  consumption is very high the stock cooler is inadequate if you guys want to hear a recommendation
[4386.72 --> 4391.44]  from me i don't usually come out and say buy this card or don't buy this card here's my recommendation
[4391.44 --> 4397.84]  don't buy this card now not now not yet soon soon perhaps because power consumption is high
[4397.84 --> 4403.20]  but the cooler can't handle all this power and all this excess that's being generated as heat
[4403.20 --> 4407.68]  whereas if we get better coolers even like an asus direct cu2 triple slot cooler or something like
[4407.68 --> 4412.24]  that that's what i'm excited for it is what can this card really do with better power delivery
[4412.24 --> 4417.76]  because amd unlike nvidia with project green light where they say okay no you can have this much power
[4417.76 --> 4422.40]  limit and this much voltage and anything else is you deal with the warranty and the returns yourself
[4422.40 --> 4428.80]  amd has according to what they told me given the partners the green light just go for gold if you want
[4428.80 --> 4437.04]  to build a card that can provide 600 watts of power to the gpu go for it that's what they told me at the gpu 14
[4437.04 --> 4443.68]  conference so if someone builds a 290 or a 290x that actually is balls to the walls in terms of the
[4443.68 --> 4449.60]  pcb design we could be looking at a whole new class of card right there wow so there you go guys that is
[4449.60 --> 4456.32]  my take on r9 290 project mantle i'm kind of tired of discussing it that's we don't know it's a big talking
[4456.32 --> 4460.40]  point however we do know a couple more things we know thief is going to support it yeah we know star
[4460.40 --> 4465.12]  citizen is going to support it we know that the upcoming game engine bloody hell what's it called
[4465.12 --> 4470.24]  um you just put in game engine yeah i can't even remember what i said about it uh anyway there's
[4470.24 --> 4474.88]  an upcoming game engine someone's working on that's going to support it and that's all a big deal maybe
[4474.88 --> 4481.84]  who knows maybe no idea much like microsoft's cloud xbox one augmentation maybe whatever who knows if
[4481.84 --> 4483.36]  crystal ball faster than it for it
[4486.40 --> 4491.68]  someone is gonna meme gift that oh for sure and they're probably gonna put a little crystal ball in
[4491.68 --> 4495.92]  thank you i would appreciate that very much actually if you can mask out when i'm behind
[4495.92 --> 4501.76]  the crystal ball or distort it somehow i'll be very impressed um okay so moving on to 780 ti from my
[4501.76 --> 4510.96]  perspective is it is it is it revolutionary no it's gk 110 it should have been gtx 680 ti boost or something
[4510.96 --> 4516.00]  like that that's what this card should have been if everything went according to if the universe was
[4516.00 --> 4519.92]  entirely perfect and it should have been 700 a year ago or whenever that card launched 680.
[4519.92 --> 4526.96]  um but i'm still stoked for it it's awesome it's super powerful super powerful um like you were
[4526.96 --> 4531.20]  talking minimum frames per second that were competitive with the maximums you were getting
[4531.20 --> 4537.20]  on like the numbers i wish i could have shown were when it wasn't crashing on only tomb raider yeah
[4537.20 --> 4543.28]  yeah we had it clocked at 12 75 and like i i wasn't locked in i might have been able to squeeze
[4543.28 --> 4549.28]  a little bit stable in everything but tomb raider um i was crushing some games i had certain games where
[4550.00 --> 4555.52]  minimum frame rates on the ti were higher than maximum frame rates for other cards like 770s and
[4555.52 --> 4562.80]  stuff like that like we're talking just like nice car destroying games i was so unfortunate that i had
[4562.80 --> 4567.92]  to clock it down just because it was crashing a tomb raider but that's a thing so that's fine um yeah we
[4567.92 --> 4572.96]  have to we okay something about our overclocked settings is we make sure they're stable they have
[4572.96 --> 4577.04]  to be stable in our entire test suite this is actually part of the problem uh in a recent video we brought
[4577.04 --> 4581.68]  up that we're going to be uh starting to use hardware bot but there's a few problems with this
[4581.68 --> 4587.04]  which might not make it possible but we're going to try anyways is um one they're only validating with
[4587.04 --> 4593.44]  like 3d mark and stuff yeah which isn't that demanding no so and then it's everyone's as fast
[4593.44 --> 4597.60]  as they can possibly get it clock and the only people that are using it are going to be people that
[4597.60 --> 4602.64]  are really insane so we might get some random bin card that might be a little bit lower and might be able
[4602.64 --> 4607.28]  to pull that in 3d mark but can't pull that in other applications so so we're still not sure how
[4607.28 --> 4611.68]  we're going to do what overclock settings we run at but if nothing else we run at what our cards are
[4611.68 --> 4618.08]  stable at in our entire test suite so moving on to okay yeah 780 ti i mean it's so expensive at least
[4618.08 --> 4622.40]  it's cheaper than titan i'll give it that it's cheaper than titan it's it's how much a 780 used to be
[4622.40 --> 4627.36]  yeah and a lot of people bought 780s yeah so i think it's at the bracket where it's not too much like a
[4627.36 --> 4631.04]  titan was too much like it was it was too much to the point it was it was above a thousand dollars people
[4631.04 --> 4636.48]  bought them lots and then 780 came along and made way more sense and now 780 ti
[4636.48 --> 4641.84]  moves titan to what it was really supposed to be title was never a gaming card nvidia launched it
[4642.48 --> 4647.92]  kind of like a gaming card like you look at the at the press that was seated a titan compared to the
[4647.92 --> 4654.24]  press that was even seated something like 780 ti a 700 card it's not about the extra 300 in the msrp
[4654.24 --> 4659.44]  it's about the fact that titan was not a gaming card it was a programming card it was a cuda card
[4659.44 --> 4665.04]  hello precision it was a compute card and then it happened to be fantastic for gaming because it got
[4665.04 --> 4670.40]  geforce grade drivers as opposed to quadro or tesla drivers that's all that happened there so titan
[4670.40 --> 4678.80]  from a gaming perspective put it out of your mind unless one scenario 4k gaming in future titles i
[4678.80 --> 4685.28]  believe titan may pull ahead of 780 ti but we might also see higher ram specs and that's only right now
[4685.28 --> 4690.32]  while titan has six gigs of ram and 780 ti only comes with three and then the other scenario was
[4690.32 --> 4696.08]  also related to memory and that was if you're going to run 4k surround or something like that
[4696.08 --> 4700.00]  and you're going to run multiple cards you need all the gpu horsepower and you need all the memory
[4700.00 --> 4703.92]  and titan will be the only way to achieve that that is the only scenario where titan makes any
[4703.92 --> 4707.52]  sense for a gamer but again we don't know there might be different models that have higher ram for
[4707.52 --> 4711.92]  780 ti and then that would remove both those situations but we have no word of it so far so if it
[4711.92 --> 4719.52]  doesn't happen then again yeah all all the fingers crossed yeah like toes crossed i actually didn't
[4719.52 --> 4725.36]  have all my fingers crossed i lied i lied that's difficult i can put it there but i can't like just
[4725.36 --> 4730.00]  do that yeah can we cross all of our fingers this is what we take up our audience time with
[4734.48 --> 4735.28]  shadow fingers
[4735.28 --> 4742.00]  all right let's go to the twitter boards let's go to the twitter boards let's hear what you guys
[4742.00 --> 4745.20]  have to say all right all right so we're going to go through these pretty quick here guys ludwig says
[4745.20 --> 4752.00]  right now for me um the r9 and the r9 290x are more important because planning to run three monitors
[4752.00 --> 4758.32]  fantastic point ludwig because amd's triple monitor support is still more seamless than nvidia's support
[4758.32 --> 4765.52]  r9 290x is the card not everyone has the budget to run a 7 no r9 290x is not the card to me for
[4765.52 --> 4773.68]  longevity even i think you're wrong because r9 290 has most of the gpu oomph that 290x does and has
[4773.68 --> 4779.52]  all the ram and all the memory bandwidth so i'm i'm more interested in 290 than 290 given the price
[4779.52 --> 4785.52]  difference between them 290 is it's killer yeah so someone says r9 290 because price to performance ratio
[4785.52 --> 4789.44]  someone says yes i think you should redo the benchmarks outside at night that would be
[4789.44 --> 4795.68]  very interesting and i hate to do this to you i'd be down it may be just r9 290 versus i think it would
[4795.68 --> 4800.88]  be 780 would be the important thing we could do like head to head we could do you want to do four
[4800.88 --> 4808.00]  cards three or four cards yeah gk 110 and then hawaii should we should we try to pick like a cold night
[4808.00 --> 4814.08]  or should i go up to like a mountain and make it epic we'll talk about it off offline okay yeah okay so
[4814.08 --> 4820.96]  ashley says r9 290 is more important it's 250 cheaper than the 780 was two weeks ago ashley has
[4820.96 --> 4825.12]  a good point because if you want to talk about importance you can talk about it in in the
[4825.12 --> 4831.12]  perspective of well what changed the market what made nvidia release 780 ti what made nvidia drop
[4831.12 --> 4837.28]  the price of their flagship card which they were perfectly content to sit back and charge 700 to
[4837.28 --> 4843.04]  a thousand for gk 110 they were going to do that all day yep and great point ashley if we want to talk
[4843.04 --> 4849.20]  importance and you know i'm probably agreeing because importance too i'm looking at the price
[4849.20 --> 4854.72]  points there's a bigger market for an r9 290 than there is for 70 ti so how much it will affect things
[4854.72 --> 4860.32]  if you're looking at it that way probably a 290. okay htt tech says 290x um i think some people are a
[4860.32 --> 4867.52]  little bit confused because the naming is so similar between these cards we're talking about r9 290 not r9 290x
[4867.52 --> 4871.92]  just to be clear i hate amd's new naming scheme i think it's rubbish if anyone from amd is watching
[4872.72 --> 4876.32]  even though you're a sponsor now i think a lot of the things you do are great i don't think this
[4876.32 --> 4880.40]  naming scheme is great they tried to make it more simple but then you're flippy flopping with x's and
[4880.40 --> 4886.00]  that's just even and are not i mean there's only like two r7 cards yeah and does r5 even exist like
[4886.00 --> 4890.64]  what was even the point of having the initial thing if you're just gonna not even segment you remember
[4890.64 --> 4897.36]  the first graph i made yeah you accidentally i think called 260x and r7 or something or 270x and
[4897.36 --> 4903.76]  r7 i think i called 280x and r8 which isn't even a thing just like this makes sense i'm typing it
[4904.72 --> 4910.64]  780ti will be more important because it can put one of their cards on top similar to how isps advertise
[4910.64 --> 4916.32]  up to that is a very good point the halo effect is a thing and i'm not talking about microsoft
[4916.32 --> 4920.72]  releasing one halo game that was great another one that was really good and then the rest that
[4920.72 --> 4924.56]  really weren't that exceptional until the most recent that's not the halo effect i'm talking about
[4924.56 --> 4929.84]  i'm talking about when you have a flagship product that's better than your competitors your direct
[4929.84 --> 4934.16]  competitors flagship product you might have two products way down in the stack i mean there was a
[4934.16 --> 4942.24]  period of time when radeon 7770 was like deep into double digits better than gtx 650 ti before they
[4942.24 --> 4947.04]  released the boost and for some reason people were still buying 650 ti's i couldn't quite figure it
[4947.04 --> 4952.08]  out because it was not a competitive card at all at that price point it puts that green bar at the top
[4952.08 --> 4956.32]  of the chart it puts that green bar at the top of the chart there's the halo effect people buying things
[4956.32 --> 4960.64]  because of how the top tier products perform even though they can't afford them is definitely a thing
[4960.64 --> 4967.28]  great point yeah from cp metis i am more excited about r9290 better performance than my 7950 that is a
[4967.28 --> 4972.48]  great point too because it comes in at a price point that 7950 upgraders who bought back when that
[4972.48 --> 4978.40]  card was released and delivers a performance upgrade that is significant so 7850 oh okay i have no idea
[4978.40 --> 4984.08]  what you're talking about then either well okay a lot of things perform better than your 7850 i say 290
[4984.08 --> 4989.60]  it's more budget friendly they're quite last gen tech 290 impressed me more with the potential of raw
[4989.60 --> 4995.36]  performance of overclocked gcn yep okay fair enough many grocery stores have freezers that get down to around
[4995.36 --> 5000.40]  minus 29 yeah we'd have a hard time convincing a grocery store to let us put a heat source in the
[5000.40 --> 5007.20]  freezer that keeps their food fresh just saying other cooling solutions have shown the card is
[5007.20 --> 5011.28]  actually coolable the 290 is more important since that's a reasonable price okay so i think we've seen
[5011.28 --> 5016.80]  pretty much um we saw a couple really interesting points about 780 ti but it's pretty much unanimous that
[5016.80 --> 5021.28]  290 is incredibly important in terms of what it did to the market and what it did for price to
[5021.28 --> 5026.16]  performance for this generation at least until nvidia brings us maxwell sometime next year and
[5026.16 --> 5032.24]  like i love both cards and honestly you heard my random comments while i was overclocking 780 ti every
[5032.24 --> 5039.76]  single time i try a new game i'm here from the other room so that was amazing but it's it's just it's so
[5039.76 --> 5045.84]  expensive i don't know um now this is a very very brief uh very brief discussion we talked about this a
[5045.84 --> 5050.56]  a little bit uh earlier so amd mantle api so adopted by various developers we already said who
[5050.56 --> 5055.04]  they were idos montreal cloud imperium games so that's thief and star citizen which makes a lot of
[5055.04 --> 5060.80]  sense since those guys were there at gpu 14 it was like who could have predicted this this was posted by
[5060.80 --> 5067.12]  tom picks on the forum who could have predicted they would have supported mantle heard anyway the
[5067.12 --> 5074.00]  thing that i don't like about mantle and physx and g-sync is that we seem to be heading in a direction
[5074.00 --> 5079.52]  and nvidia can criticize amd all they want about the way that adding another api fragments the
[5079.52 --> 5086.56]  market and they're right it does direct x and open gl and mobile and console that was enough already
[5086.56 --> 5092.00]  we actually don't need more unless like please andy if you don't deliver compelling performance
[5092.00 --> 5098.56]  improvements with mantle oh boy you guys have hyped this up an awful lot for that to not happen so i am
[5098.56 --> 5103.44]  rooting for you here it better be awesome however you'll get slaughtered you guys are going to get
[5103.44 --> 5109.20]  torn apart but the thing i don't like about it is that i don't see nvidia's approach with some things
[5109.20 --> 5114.96]  that differently the way that i see physics is it's is it's it's it's it's just a custom change to an
[5114.96 --> 5121.04]  api that already exists that enhances the gameplay experience for some customers who all paid 60 for
[5121.04 --> 5127.04]  that game and not others that's the thing i don't like here is star citizen is a game that i want to
[5127.04 --> 5133.68]  experience in the best way possible if i can't have g-sync and physics we already know the game's
[5133.68 --> 5139.52]  going to support physics and mantle and affinity and all these technologies audio or whatever i'm
[5139.52 --> 5144.96]  going to be disappointed i paid 250 to play that game yeah true audio is another example i want to
[5144.96 --> 5149.84]  experience it the way the game developer can deliver it to me if they have all the technology available at
[5149.84 --> 5154.64]  least give me the option to run two cards and if i have to just run true audio on my amd card then fine but
[5154.64 --> 5160.72]  i want to have an option as a consumer that is the thing that i feel like is happening here and i
[5160.72 --> 5164.80]  don't really like it so that was all i wanted to say about it we even had a conversation earlier which
[5164.80 --> 5169.52]  is this is bounding off something that you just said i even putting two cards in yeah like it's
[5169.52 --> 5176.64]  impossible you can't we even like video like blocks at every turn every hack they've seen for running
[5176.64 --> 5182.48]  a secondary dedicated nvidia card for physics yeah like like we couldn't do that setup you couldn't have
[5182.48 --> 5186.72]  like mirrored inputs so you're actually playing two computers at the same time even like that doesn't
[5186.72 --> 5193.04]  even bring it close enough which is is kind of ridiculous all right so moving on to things that
[5193.04 --> 5199.44]  we're unhappy with or it seems that the entire internet is unhappy with um metacritic the scores
[5199.44 --> 5208.40]  for call of duty ghosts so get this from official reviewers we have a score of 74 all right so that's out
[5208.40 --> 5216.72]  of 100 the user score and this is on the uh which one this is the xbox 360 version yeah is 2.1 based
[5216.72 --> 5224.96]  generally unfavorable ratings based on 931 ratings so going back to our doc here uh we actually we looked
[5224.96 --> 5233.84]  them all up so xbox 360 has a user score of 2.1 pc has a user score of 1.7 pc gamers expect better
[5233.84 --> 5241.44]  apparently well there's also um some specific bugs on pc ps3 has a score of 1.8 and ps4 actually has a
[5241.44 --> 5245.84]  significant number of negative user reviews but based on the fact that that's not out yet i'm gonna
[5245.84 --> 5251.12]  go ahead and call bs on those ones now this might be a case of gamers blowing things out of proportion
[5251.12 --> 5258.00]  we know that they do that gamers out of 10 it's not a 1.3 i seriously doubt it's a one it's still a
[5258.00 --> 5264.96]  triple a title like 1.3 we're talking like farm simulator that doesn't have any tractors in it
[5264.96 --> 5272.80]  like like like let's talk about what if you ever got a score on a test that was 13 or 20
[5273.68 --> 5278.24]  how how little did you know about the subject matter that's that's taking a multiple choice test
[5278.24 --> 5282.24]  but just not actually filling in all the answers because multiple choice tests filling in all the
[5282.24 --> 5288.88]  answers would be better it would be you could still yield 20 to 25 yeah okay so so so there's
[5288.88 --> 5294.80]  that thing all right um at the same time like it's from what i've heard i haven't played it it's
[5294.80 --> 5299.52]  basically the exact same damn game i watched total biscuits review yeah he was just like yeah it's
[5300.08 --> 5304.32]  and everything that he brought up was very true and it should have gotten slaughtered maybe a little
[5304.32 --> 5307.60]  bit too much but like maybe a bit too much it did deserve it to a certain degree and you know what
[5307.60 --> 5313.12]  this is how the gaming community talks to people yeah so they're talking so they're talking and
[5313.12 --> 5318.00]  they've obviously haven't completely abandoned call of duty if they're willing to talk this much they
[5318.00 --> 5324.80]  they're probably saying hey guys fix your crap and then we'll maybe buy your game later so yeah there's
[5324.80 --> 5331.84]  that um i think we should still benchmark it because oh yeah and okay the the hate train doesn't stop
[5331.84 --> 5335.84]  doesn't stop there the hate train only just left the station okay hold on apparently we had this in
[5335.84 --> 5342.96]  there twice we had uh oh yeah we had the metacritic thing and then we had blah blah blah blah uh oh
[5342.96 --> 5348.96]  the whole thing about one billion uh sales like right at the very beginning um that was sales to
[5348.96 --> 5353.76]  retailers not to actual end users so that was that was kind of awesome so we actually don't know quite
[5353.76 --> 5359.12]  know how many copies of cod ghosts are actually out there um the next uh the next thing that there's a
[5359.12 --> 5365.76]  whole lot of hate for is the six gig requirement on the pc version so qwerty warrior posted this on the
[5365.76 --> 5372.00]  forum and i thought this was pretty interesting so hackers have bypassed it but basically what the
[5372.00 --> 5379.44]  developer did was they put a hard limit an artificial hard limit into the game that doesn't let you even
[5379.44 --> 5384.16]  launch it if you do not have six gigs of ram in your system and this is a problem for a number of
[5384.16 --> 5390.08]  reasons number one is many gaming machines have four gigs of ram number two is that the game only uses
[5390.08 --> 5395.44]  between 1.2 to 2 gigs of memory when it's in use and i'm pretty sure most people don't use more than
[5395.44 --> 5400.64]  two gigs of ram at the desktop if they have four gigs and number three is the fact that even people
[5400.64 --> 5407.12]  who have six gigs of memory in their system might have some of it taken up by an onboard graphics card
[5407.12 --> 5412.72]  that's running in something like nvidia optimus mode so some of it is dedicated to the frame buffer of
[5412.72 --> 5419.20]  their onboard graphics and the game won't run even though they have six gigs of memory a hard limit is a
[5419.20 --> 5424.56]  stupid thing to have as a minimum requirement let me install the game and let me find out if it's
[5424.56 --> 5430.00]  okay and i'll upgrade my graphics if it's not working well enough for me thank you very much so
[5430.00 --> 5434.48]  one of the things i'm going to do when we benchmark it is i'm going to benchmark it with their thing
[5434.48 --> 5438.32]  enabled whatever the crap and then i'm going to install the hackers tool to remove it and we're
[5438.32 --> 5443.12]  going to test it with four gigs compared to six gigs in those configurations so we can laugh at them
[5443.12 --> 5448.24]  because there's no difference so the cracked version already runs and installs just fine with four
[5448.24 --> 5453.04]  gigs of ram and the real version this isn't this the article is on next power up by the way and the
[5453.04 --> 5459.52]  real version does not so once again breaking games and pirating them which is something that i don't
[5459.52 --> 5464.32]  support and something that we'd all love to find a way to get away from and the industry needs to figure
[5464.32 --> 5470.88]  out a way to stop they need to deliver games that work and then i mean stuff like this we actually have
[5470.88 --> 5476.24]  people who legit can't play a legit copy of the game you got to stop doing that because that's not helping
[5476.24 --> 5482.56]  and that's just making piracy that much better i hate saying that but it's true like this is why
[5482.56 --> 5487.60]  it's existing this strongly is because when people have to run away from legitimately buying it and
[5487.60 --> 5492.88]  legitimately playing it because that solution is crap and they have to run to these pirates that are
[5492.88 --> 5498.16]  actually saving them that's a problem yes you are you're making those guys good guys and you're
[5498.16 --> 5504.40]  making yourselves bad guys that is terrible absolutely terrible guys at this point like
[5505.76 --> 5512.88]  it's not their fault i don't know all right so we have uh hold on i just gotta i want to pull up the
[5512.88 --> 5518.48]  document here just so that i can bring up this video because this has already made the rounds and i know
[5518.48 --> 5523.12]  we're not the first people to talk about it but i thought it was pretty hilarious and that was the
[5523.12 --> 5529.68]  copy-pasted cut scene uh in the new call of duty game so let's just go ahead and fire this baby up
[5530.40 --> 5535.12]  the youtube
[5535.12 --> 5556.48]  okay well whatever i was trying to move the ad there at the end but like seriously guys my yeah my
[5557.28 --> 5563.84]  i don't like it either but my devil's advocate claim to it is one of their uh things for a long
[5563.84 --> 5569.76]  seriously guys i don't know i'm trying one of their things for a really long time was war never
[5569.76 --> 5573.36]  changes so i don't know maybe they're trying to pull on that but they could have done it a lot
[5573.36 --> 5577.76]  better and like if they did if that was their whole point they could have done like a fade to black and
[5577.76 --> 5581.84]  then had the text war never changes on it and then everyone would have understand it and it would have
[5581.84 --> 5586.96]  been okay did you just say understand it yes because that dirt moment wasn't as bad as the one that we
[5586.96 --> 5593.68]  just showed so i was i've been like trying to pull myself through that because i don't actually agree with it
[5593.68 --> 5601.12]  at all so i screwed up one of the words speaking of things we rarely agree with ea
[5603.04 --> 5608.48]  all right i know where you're going so ea never content to let someone else have all the bad press
[5608.48 --> 5614.88]  this was posted this was posted on the forum by only smoking uh battlefield 4 is facing a number of
[5614.88 --> 5621.44]  issues on all platforms at the moment etc etc etc there's some there's some some some emails and some
[5621.44 --> 5626.40]  messages and stuff going on here with some names blacked out but the pretty much the gist of it is
[5628.56 --> 5631.52]  dice was still trying to develop the game they're still trying to add things to the game they're
[5631.52 --> 5636.72]  still trying to actually do qa on some things and ea was like nope we're releasing before cod
[5637.92 --> 5644.32]  yeah so yeah we've had some positive things to say about ea we've had some weeks where we've said nothing
[5644.32 --> 5653.36]  about ea but this is a problem ea i mean if the game's not done the game's not done okay if someone
[5653.36 --> 5662.16]  uses a silence weapon it shouldn't mute the entire server and if you had let if you'd let ghosts release
[5662.16 --> 5669.36]  with a dog ahead of your game you wouldn't have even had to worry about it anymore because everyone
[5669.36 --> 5674.32]  would have had battlefield 4 on their christmas list so fast i mean i guess you have no way of
[5674.32 --> 5680.88]  predicting that cod ghost was going to be terrible but uh come on guys and i mean there's some other
[5680.88 --> 5687.60]  things that are kind of bothering me here too the battlefield 4 dlc is coming hard and heavy so they've
[5687.60 --> 5693.28]  already they're already talking about two dlcs so china rising and then what was the bloody other one
[5693.28 --> 5699.12]  called back to uh basically basically the second one is just like a bunch of battlefield 3 maps that
[5699.12 --> 5704.88]  people like yeah so battlefield 3 maps that people liked come on guys you didn't even redesign the
[5704.88 --> 5710.32]  maps you're skinning them um that should have been in the game if you already knew people like them i mean
[5710.32 --> 5713.92]  based on the fact that they're already done so quickly means they were pretty much already done
[5714.48 --> 5719.92]  um basically to me what they're doing and i talked to i talked to edzel actually because he bought the
[5719.92 --> 5725.68]  premium membership okay and he basically went well yeah i with all of the expansion packs and the way
[5725.68 --> 5731.12]  that people move on to the new version when an expansion pack rolls out i just got premium because
[5731.12 --> 5735.84]  that's the only way to really keep up it's a simpler solution okay and and you get uh pre-release but i
[5735.84 --> 5739.76]  have a problem with this i have a problem with the deceptive way that it's being marketed sorry second
[5739.76 --> 5743.36]  assault that's what second assault thank you so i have a problem with the deceptive way it's being
[5743.36 --> 5749.84]  marketed battlefield 4 is being marketed as a 59.99 title okay you can pay 69.99
[5749.84 --> 5754.96]  and you can get uh what is it some some random launch day dlc but you don't actually get i think
[5754.96 --> 5760.16]  you get china rising as well with digital deluxe so you can pay a little bit more and you can get
[5760.16 --> 5766.08]  the first expansion pack and then a little bit of other dlc or you can get the premium one which will
[5766.08 --> 5772.24]  actually ensure that your copy of battlefield 4 is the copy of battlefield 4 throughout the game's
[5772.24 --> 5776.80]  release cycle what they have effectively done is they have figured out a way to market you that their
[5776.80 --> 5784.64]  game is 60 but actually have you willingly give them 110 now i've seen a lot of comments on this
[5784.64 --> 5790.72]  where people were saying oh why do we all hate dlc now when we in like the the community gaming community
[5790.72 --> 5797.68]  as a whole loves expansions or loved expansions it's not the same thing um when warcraft 3 got an
[5797.68 --> 5802.96]  expansion two two this was my i i'm the one who wrote this oh wait are you talking about warcraft 3 yeah
[5802.96 --> 5806.80]  oh because my notes are on warcraft 2 actually oh that's funny we both have the same thought
[5809.12 --> 5814.56]  all right i'll let you go first screw it work out work out two work out three as any of the starcrafts
[5814.56 --> 5818.56]  i have the numbers i don't have the numbers all right i got i got numbers man all right but like
[5818.56 --> 5823.68]  when a game like this gets an expansion it's it's it's happy everyone enjoys it because it's a while
[5823.68 --> 5829.36]  down the line it adds a ton to the game and it's just adding life to the game okay so tides of darkness
[5829.36 --> 5834.80]  got an expansion four months after release tides of darkness wasn't a predominantly multiplayer game
[5834.80 --> 5838.96]  so they weren't fundamentally breaking the experience that was tides of darkness you were
[5838.96 --> 5843.84]  getting a new single player campaign and you were getting like a couple heroes and like maybe more
[5843.84 --> 5848.00]  custom map options like like that's all you were really getting when you bought beyond the dark portal
[5848.00 --> 5852.64]  okay you also got a fantastic disco song that i liked earlier this week on youtube you guys should go
[5852.64 --> 5858.40]  check it out it was on the cd all right when starcraft which was a predominantly multiplayer game got an
[5858.40 --> 5865.68]  expansion it took eight months so there was actually some time to enjoy the vanilla experience
[5865.68 --> 5872.64]  and have an experience before blizzard the evilest of all companies actually asked you to fork over
[5872.64 --> 5878.08]  more money along with all of your bros so you could all play the game and have the new updated balance
[5878.08 --> 5884.08]  system and all of those updated things my issue with battlefield 4 is we're talking like a month and
[5884.08 --> 5889.28]  change out of the gate out of the gate so many planned already so they have made their 60 game
[5889.28 --> 5894.64]  a 70 game if you want to be playing for more than like a couple months with all of the content and
[5894.64 --> 5900.96]  then they've turned it into a 110 game if you want to own what would typically be uh you know a one
[5900.96 --> 5907.76]  expansion pack or two expansion pack release cycle in the past if you want to own the five expansion packs
[5907.76 --> 5914.88]  that they already have listed i mean to me that's a problem the fact that all the expansion packs are
[5914.88 --> 5923.84]  here like now yeah it's like here's all the plan for all the stuff that we want you to all buy um
[5924.96 --> 5930.64]  so maybe this is all just uneducated hate from me and battlefield 4 fans are ripping me apart so
[5930.64 --> 5934.88]  someone brought up battlefield 3 release premium a while okay someone brought up that second assault is
[5934.88 --> 5939.76]  getting redesigned maps okay so fine i still maintain that they were probably done if they're
[5939.76 --> 5945.12]  being released now they're saying four really i read four maps over in battlefield 3 but either way
[5945.12 --> 5951.28]  i haven't looked too far into it because i just was like oh i hate dlc moving on um so that's probably
[5951.28 --> 5955.52]  part of it and like one of my favorite companies has been actually kind of known to be one of the
[5955.52 --> 5960.24]  worst for this um although they've kind of fixed it was bethesda when they released horse armor that was
[5960.24 --> 5965.44]  hilarious and stupid and that should not but at least it didn't alter the gameplay in any way and
[5965.44 --> 5971.60]  it wasn't going to make it in any way at all like the game worked if you bought the game you had the
[5971.60 --> 5976.88]  whole game and all of the mods and all of the blah blah blah all of that stuff forever where and you
[5976.88 --> 5983.68]  didn't pay 110 for it so i'm gonna give bethesda a pass because i have no problem with horse armor that
[5983.68 --> 5988.48]  doesn't do anything as long as people understand it doesn't do anything forum badges on minus tech tips
[5988.48 --> 5992.64]  forum don't don't do anything but we were upfront about that we said look this is a way you can
[5992.64 --> 6000.96]  support us i'm okay with that i mean i hope because we did it i was like uh that's probably a good thing
[6000.96 --> 6004.80]  let's hope i'm okay with that speaking of which we are going to have another fundraiser campaign
[6004.80 --> 6010.00]  first blood was amazingly successful and we are so thankful to everyone who contributed to it
[6010.00 --> 6016.72]  we have a plan we are looking at a pretty significant website upgrade for linus tech tips.com and a
[6016.72 --> 6023.04]  pretty significant equipment upgrade for some oh yeah uh diesel sent it out yeah i know whatever
[6023.76 --> 6028.24]  we just have to make sure it's as good or better now no pressure we don't know if it's possible
[6028.24 --> 6033.04]  so anyway um so we're planning an upgraded website don't worry it's still going to be a forum first
[6033.04 --> 6036.80]  and foremost and a lot of the front page content will be tied into the forum that will be his job and
[6036.80 --> 6041.92]  he will do a great job of it and it will be timely anyway moving moving on we are also planning an
[6041.92 --> 6046.80]  equipment upgrade that is going to allow us to bring you guys a daily show the issue is that with
[6046.80 --> 6054.56]  all the technical difficulties that we only own one proper camera right now so we need and one microphone
[6054.56 --> 6061.20]  and one and one stand one mic stand and like a couple lights like we actually have one set of everything
[6061.20 --> 6066.40]  and in order to have a daily show and have no technical difficulties so that we can basically prep it
[6066.40 --> 6070.48]  and sit down and shoot it and bring it to you guys on the tech quickie channel we are going to need
[6070.48 --> 6075.28]  another set of gear that basically lives on the new set so we are going to be doing a campaign
[6075.28 --> 6081.12]  to help us fund those upgrades so that's going to be coming soon and speaking of campaigns and um
[6082.08 --> 6086.00]  stop stop oh yeah okay hold on no i don't want to play it on there anyway actually i want to play it
[6086.00 --> 6090.96]  here speaking of campaigns back to battlefield 4 it has a campaign i heard it ain't that great but this
[6090.96 --> 6098.24]  is nothing to do with the campaign i was just looking for a segue and it did not happen so where'd it go
[6098.24 --> 6108.72]  where's my segue where's my segue here we go this in my mind is the worst thing that dice ea and
[6108.72 --> 6124.72]  whoever was involved in this terrible decision could have possibly possibly done
[6128.24 --> 6150.64]  really rated m for me really you had an opportunity and i mean i'm not i'm not the biggest feminism
[6150.64 --> 6154.24]  activist in the world by any stretch of the imagination i don't think i talk about this a whole
[6154.24 --> 6160.40]  lot on the show but you guys had an opportunity to be progressive here the game had a had a female
[6160.40 --> 6166.96]  character in it that was really good this was an innovation it was a way to set yourselves apart
[6166.96 --> 6172.40]  from the depiction of females and the way that other companies are doing it the depiction of females
[6172.40 --> 6178.32]  in the military you had an opportunity to be above this she was like one of the better characters and
[6178.32 --> 6185.68]  you partnered with axe to create an ad that's like if you wear axe chicks will get out of tanks they
[6185.68 --> 6190.32]  will meet you in the middle of a bridge with destructible buildings falling down behind you and they
[6190.32 --> 6192.96]  will be into you are you kidding me
[6198.24 --> 6206.32]  like what and i'm wondering who spent the time to painstakingly script in hannah the girl that's in the single player campaign
[6206.32 --> 6210.88]  and like make all of her writing good and make it so that all the the guy gamers would accept her and she
[6210.88 --> 6215.20]  could still be a good female proponent with her being without being a sex symbol and all this kind of stuff
[6215.20 --> 6220.96]  i wonder how upset they were when they were not consoled at all and they just probably randomly saw this
[6220.96 --> 6227.12]  ad through a news site and had no idea it happened like unbelievable now they must have known it was coming
[6227.12 --> 6233.04]  i'm sure they i'm sure they were upset about it but like all the brownie points that you scored by being
[6233.04 --> 6239.12]  being progressive the gone done done done done done done done you're so done all right speaking of
[6239.12 --> 6243.84]  things that are done google speaks out or a couple of google employees to be clear so blah blah blah the
[6243.84 --> 6248.00]  opinions represented blah blah blah blah are not at blah blah blah okay all so all those disclaimers so
[6248.00 --> 6252.40]  there's a couple google employees who are speaking up this is an article on the verge by the way against
[6252.40 --> 6261.76]  the nsa so brandon downey and mike hearn have posted um the old f you to google because of something that
[6261.76 --> 6267.44]  google's been to google pardon me to the nsa because of something the nsa has been doing which
[6267.44 --> 6276.24]  is on google's private fiber links okay the nsa so where they actually transmit data between their
[6276.24 --> 6282.88]  data centers mostly for backup okay in an unencrypted form the nsa has been pulling data
[6284.88 --> 6290.56]  really nsa so google has between these two guys they've been talking about some of the things that
[6290.56 --> 6296.88]  they've been how outraged they are that the nsa is just taking data from google that they have not
[6296.88 --> 6304.32]  asked for so for one thing and they've talked about how they're putting solutions in place as a big fu to
[6304.32 --> 6311.04]  encrypt that data even when it's moving in between google's own servers on their own secure networks
[6311.04 --> 6317.20]  because just the outrage and i think there's not really much more for us to say beyond that and that
[6317.20 --> 6321.44]  this nsa thing is getting a little bit out of hand here it's getting a little bit nuts and one of the
[6321.44 --> 6326.56]  things that i brought up is like when we when we all sign our souls away signing up for a gmail account
[6326.56 --> 6330.08]  or whatever yeah because google sells all your personal information too don't get like be real
[6330.08 --> 6334.80]  clear about that but they usually sell it like anonymously let's all your data but without a name
[6334.80 --> 6341.76]  or something like that and when the nsa takes it it's not anonymous it's very attached and very utilized
[6341.76 --> 6348.08]  and it's yeah so this was information that all came out it was uh the scandal comes from a little
[6348.08 --> 6352.96]  internal nsa diagram of like here's some sneaky way we're going to steal the data that was part of
[6352.96 --> 6357.84]  and then the little smiley face and then the little smiley face yeah oh man so not only are they stealing
[6357.84 --> 6364.48]  the data they're being you know snarky and like yeah yeah you know sneaky about it internally no one's
[6364.48 --> 6371.76]  happy with you nsa all right on to more good news this looks amazing freaking awesome so this was posted
[6371.76 --> 6379.76]  by orifice on the forum it's a fudzilla.com article and they're claiming that the negra the negra the
[6379.76 --> 6386.72]  nvidia tegra note 7 is coming out november 12th so that would be in four days which i will have one
[6387.52 --> 6392.72]  heck of a conversation to have with nvidia if we're not seated one of these just like we weren't with shield
[6392.72 --> 6396.48]  on time yeah seriously because they said they were going to deal with that we're not going to get one
[6396.48 --> 6402.32]  on time i it's kind of starting if that's a holiday if that date mind you they might announce it that day
[6402.88 --> 6406.80]  and then because shield was announced and stuff before review samples were shipped out and before
[6406.80 --> 6413.36]  it was released and all that but anyway anyway anyway um so spec wise we're looking at a seven seven
[6413.36 --> 6420.32]  inch 1280 by 800 ips screen which i'm okay with it's ips i like that yeah for ips ips is good particularly
[6420.32 --> 6424.96]  from a gaming perspective at that size i don't notice it that much it's only really text where
[6424.96 --> 6432.32]  1080p would make a difference to me at that size 1.8 gigahertz tegra 4 processor boom boom only one gig
[6432.32 --> 6439.04]  of ram so they aren't the best specs ever it has 2.4 gigahertz 802.11 and 16 gigs of storage micro sd slot
[6439.04 --> 6444.00]  4100 milliamp hour battery and based on what great battery life shield gets with the tegra 4 and similar
[6444.00 --> 6449.84]  specs it's going to have a pretty beastly battery life micro hdmi out five megapixel rear camera
[6449.84 --> 6457.36]  and it supports game stream which makes that micro hdmi out super important and not a small
[6457.36 --> 6462.64]  thing to roll over not a big not a small deal so supports game stream according to the rumors which
[6462.64 --> 6469.28]  we haven't heard anything about it supports game stream and is 199.99 so guys game stream i've been
[6469.28 --> 6474.32]  talking i mean it's happened sooner than i thought but to me consoles are already a thing of the past
[6474.32 --> 6480.64]  because if for 199 i can have something that's a tablet and it's my console and i can use my already
[6480.64 --> 6486.48]  beefy beefy beefy beefer buffer beefy i don't know what i was trying to say there and i can use my
[6486.48 --> 6493.36]  powerful pc to drive games at 720p or 1080p with a wired internet connection or ethernet connection
[6493.36 --> 6498.40]  excuse me i can't say anything right today so if i can drive 1080p games on my tv that'll actually be a
[6498.40 --> 6503.68]  better experience than what ps4 or xbox one can deliver out of the gate assuming you already also
[6503.68 --> 6509.68]  own a pc and many gamers are gamers they're not pc gamers or xbox gamers or playstation 4 they're
[6509.68 --> 6514.56]  gamers they own consoles they own gaming pcs they want to appreciate everything that's available on
[6514.56 --> 6518.64]  all the platforms and obviously this won't give you access to the exclusive content that's available
[6518.64 --> 6524.88]  for consoles but it's a way to at least have the couch gaming experience with things like racing games
[6524.88 --> 6529.84]  and use the power of your pc to do it and one of the things with shield um is if i wanted to play
[6529.84 --> 6534.08]  an android game the tablet style surface is probably fine because they're all designed for it and if i
[6534.08 --> 6539.84]  wanted to play a pc game um if i was going to play with a controller the mobile thing isn't super
[6539.84 --> 6544.96]  attractive to me like it's pretty cool but you probably just want to play on the couch anyways and
[6544.96 --> 6550.88]  with this it supports attaching wireless controllers to it or wired if you wanted to so i could just hook it
[6550.88 --> 6554.72]  up to the tv so i find this to be a much more attractive device than shield and nvidia
[6554.72 --> 6560.00]  is even doing certifications of controllers they're calling them sufficiently low latency
[6560.00 --> 6564.08]  and they're certifying them and they're putting them on nvidia.com awesome so you will even be
[6564.08 --> 6568.96]  able to pick up a controller that you know will deliver a great gaming experience sweet with your
[6568.96 --> 6574.24]  um with your tablet or your or your shield i didn't know about it so this is an article on pc purr so the
[6574.24 --> 6579.76]  verge is the original source but valve steam machine and steam controller the reference designs are shown off
[6579.76 --> 6584.64]  and i thought this was fake because i was like it looks like it was made by like a portal fan
[6584.64 --> 6590.96]  or something which it might have been which it might have been um valve apparently is not actually
[6590.96 --> 6595.36]  going to sell this the reference steam machine yeah i had no idea i thought they were so they're
[6595.36 --> 6601.04]  going to seed them out but that's it they're not actually going to sell them however they're releasing
[6601.04 --> 6606.56]  the cad files so anyone could make one and i hope someone does i'd love to see someone like evga
[6607.12 --> 6613.20]  release a reference because they're so good at just taking a great reference design and gussying it up and
[6613.20 --> 6617.68]  marketing it well and making it competitive and having it available everywhere i'd love to see evga
[6617.68 --> 6622.64]  do it there if anyone from evga is watching i want to see a reference steam machine powered by your
[6622.64 --> 6627.04]  graphics cards that's awesome i also want to see people just make their own the cad files are freely
[6627.04 --> 6634.00]  available yeah 3d printing that's what i was actually most excited for of course uh a board
[6634.00 --> 6640.32]  partner making you heard about that first metal 3d printed gun right well it's you have to have a 500 000
[6640.32 --> 6645.12]  plus machine to be able to make it okay you have to have all this stuff behind it too sure but it's
[6645.12 --> 6649.52]  the beginning of oh of course and there will be the trickle down effect in terms of price and it would
[6649.52 --> 6655.92]  the the process for it will get better and 500 000 to a criminal organization is not necessarily too
[6655.92 --> 6662.32]  much money not necessarily for unmarked guns yeah yeah yeah there's a thing to think about yeah no i know
[6662.32 --> 6667.04]  it's just it's not the a lot of people are jumping on it going like oh my god anyone can make a gun
[6667.04 --> 6671.60]  well not really that's not that's not quite a thing kind of have to like sell your house um
[6672.16 --> 6676.08]  all right so maybe we'll do some rapid fire stories i know we missed a couple things but we've run
[6676.08 --> 6680.40]  significantly over time here so i knew this week was gonna be nuts the when show doc this week was
[6680.40 --> 6686.48]  insane so many great topics i mean november is here everyone all right so here's some positive pr for
[6686.48 --> 6693.12]  amd i think this has been a very amd positive stream overall 99vw posted on the forum this is a reddit
[6693.12 --> 6697.36]  reddit is the original source so some guy's neighbor was cleaning his gun and accidentally
[6697.36 --> 6702.96]  discharged it it ruined the guy's pc he posted on reddit he was contacted so you can actually see
[6702.96 --> 6709.36]  what uh amd's pr department said here if you can read this on the stream blah blah okay whatever
[6709.36 --> 6713.68]  we're gonna it'll be in the doc which we link on the forum yeah there you go maybe you can read it
[6713.68 --> 6719.52]  like this anyway this is ridiculous amd contacts the guy gives him a new pc essentially like four
[6719.52 --> 6724.64]  components that revitalized it like fixes his pc they didn't fix the case but i'm cool like that
[6724.64 --> 6728.64]  like that yeah there's a bullet hole in your case like how sweet is that it's not like that sticker
[6728.64 --> 6734.24]  bullet hole it's an act it got shot like that's pretty cool i think that's pretty that's pretty
[6734.24 --> 6740.96]  that's pretty beast mode right there all right so next up we've got oh it saved my zoom setting okay
[6741.52 --> 6749.44]  lg's g flex which sounds a lot more gangster than it is g flex g flex it's like the phone for like
[6749.76 --> 6754.88]  drug dealers like i'm sure lg won't put that in the market like eight different numbers on one sim
[6754.88 --> 6761.76]  card speaking of which guys if you have a moment maybe tweet at lg's usa twitter handle because that
[6761.76 --> 6766.96]  ad that we showed you like a month ago or whatever where the deal was we wanted a review unit of the g2
[6766.96 --> 6772.88]  and we were going to show you that ad um their pr firm so it's not actually necessarily lg's fault to be
[6772.88 --> 6777.68]  clear they may not even know this happened but their pr firm contacted me again and said we need you to
[6777.68 --> 6782.88]  show two more of them and i kind of said well no because the deal was we showed one and then we got
[6782.88 --> 6787.36]  a review unit so maybe just kind of let them know we could probably use a review unit of the g2 at
[6787.36 --> 6793.76]  some point here um all right so the upcoming g flex has a curved screen and a very noticeable arc
[6794.32 --> 6800.40]  so let's go ahead to engadget's video here should i go grab my phone yeah where it is actually no it
[6800.40 --> 6805.20]  doesn't matter okay so they showed how you can take this curved phone and you can actually flex
[6805.20 --> 6809.60]  it out to the point where it is oh i should probably mute that shoot sorry guys so you can
[6809.60 --> 6814.24]  flex it to the point where it's pretty much straight so you can see they take it here and bend it over
[6814.24 --> 6815.68]  bend it over the table like that
[6818.72 --> 6820.32]  you know i had to do that um
[6823.04 --> 6828.72]  you know i think this was not news so as much as we talked about it maybe it was just an excuse to get
[6828.72 --> 6832.64]  you guys to tell lg we need a g2 we could use a g flex too while we're at it i wouldn't mind seeing
[6832.64 --> 6837.92]  what the curved screen experience is like but i've seen galaxy s3s and s4s flex that much
[6838.64 --> 6844.40]  it's like how to turn your s4 into a curved screen smartphone i i torqued mine in with how much
[6844.40 --> 6848.96]  pressure he was putting on that i think it flexed easier but my phone while it probably wasn't good
[6848.96 --> 6855.68]  for it can flex quite a bit all right next up is amd will be selling intel based servers i don't think
[6855.68 --> 6860.88]  this is that big of a deal nice hat i think it's just ironic yeah nice hat posted this on the forum
[6860.88 --> 6866.72]  so amd recently won a contract to supply verizon with servers so verizon is wants to get into the
[6866.72 --> 6873.36]  whole cloud thing and it was through an acquisition that amd made last year of c micro
[6873.36 --> 6878.48]  the only issue so c micro is a server maker and they have these extremely compact high density servers
[6878.48 --> 6882.56]  that they are selling to companies like verizon they look really cool i mean here look at this thing
[6882.56 --> 6891.04]  guys it has an lga 2011 socket two sodium memory slots a chipset what looks like some other uh
[6891.04 --> 6896.64]  complicated communication bridges here and then it has a proprietary interface that actually looks
[6896.64 --> 6903.84]  like two pci express 16x interfaces really really cool looking board and look how big it is i mean
[6903.84 --> 6909.92]  that's a cpu it's small very very small so very cool technology unfortunately three quarters of the
[6909.92 --> 6915.20]  servers that verizon's ordering are intel based so amd will still be making money on the transactions
[6915.20 --> 6920.96]  as a middleman so to speak but they have to sell intel based servers over time they'll be able to
[6920.96 --> 6925.60]  phase out those models and implement amd models and all that it's not really that big of a deal it's
[6925.60 --> 6933.04]  just kind of funny uh steve jobs's childhood is now a uh a landmark oh my god childhood did i say
[6933.04 --> 6937.28]  childhood i said his childhood's landmark because that's not what i meant to say childhood home is now
[6937.28 --> 6942.08]  landmark and i also think that that i clicked on the wrong link i am not not having a good day
[6942.08 --> 6948.40]  his childhood is a landmark okay it is now a historic an historic resource so this was posted by snickers
[6949.28 --> 6953.84]  and this was a post on techno buffalo guys if you haven't seen the land show from last week
[6953.84 --> 6959.68]  go watch it john for lakers was one of the best guests we've ever had awesome even just go back and
[6959.68 --> 6964.64]  watch the archive of the segment with him we had some great conversation anyway techno buffalo is john's site
[6964.64 --> 6969.52]  um so the house where steve jobs grew up is now an historic resource blah blah the one style ranch
[6969.52 --> 6977.36]  et cetera et cetera et cetera all right my comment was i wonder if there's any acid tabs left patricia
[6977.36 --> 6984.24]  okay get this patricia jobs oh that's hilarious still lives in the house and then the historic
[6984.24 --> 6988.96]  designation will make it more complicated if she wants to renovate the house in the future basically
[6988.96 --> 6993.76]  meaning she can't the commission was not required to get her approval before moving forward with the
[6993.76 --> 7001.44]  vote and it not only was it not required it didn't it didn't bother just yep doesn't matter i mean i'm
[7001.44 --> 7010.96]  sure she's honored and all that but seriously like seriously that's kind of brutal um people oh yeah
[7010.96 --> 7017.84]  people suck at passwords this was a post on xkcd which is an amazing web comic uh wait the post was on
[7017.84 --> 7025.28]  our forum post was on our forum posted by cuddlesworth 9419 okay saying that 1.9 million people that you
[7025.28 --> 7032.80]  credit it to oh no xk xkcd did the math right sorry i think no what did they do i did i read it wrong
[7032.80 --> 7041.44]  okay you totally read it wrong okay so there was a post on a techniques about how 1.9 million people used
[7041.44 --> 7047.52]  123456 as their password for adobe because adobe recently got hacked and they yeah so i had to change
[7047.52 --> 7052.64]  my password and all that for creative cloud yeah so 1.9 million people suck at passwords and then if
[7052.64 --> 7060.48]  you and then unrelated if you go to xkcd's post sorry i misread this um this was my addition to it
[7060.48 --> 7066.32]  is like if for for you and your friends and your parents and anyone else who ever has to set a password
[7066.32 --> 7071.92]  so everyone they should probably read this post by xkcd which covers how people should be making
[7071.92 --> 7076.64]  passwords they don't end up being one two three four five six because that's ridiculous people make
[7076.64 --> 7079.92]  those kind of passwords because passwords are hard to come up with and they're hard to remember
[7079.92 --> 7083.36]  but if you come up with four random things that are the first things that come to your head
[7083.36 --> 7087.84]  it's probably a really strong password and probably really easy the only issue i have with this is the
[7087.84 --> 7093.36]  number of sites that have requirements yeah that are like well you must have this and you must have
[7093.36 --> 7097.36]  that but this is guys if you aren't familiar if you haven't been on the internet ever before in your
[7097.36 --> 7103.76]  life and you're not familiar with xkcd it's amazing awesome xkcd.com it's it claims to be about math and
[7103.76 --> 7109.04]  romance but it's actually just hilarious for anyone even if you don't have a girlfriend and you don't
[7109.04 --> 7113.36]  know any math and not that i'm saying anyone who's watching our show on friday night doesn't have a
[7113.36 --> 7121.12]  girlfriend i mean you probably do quick twitter blitz who here has a girlfriend
[7124.00 --> 7128.40]  actually it's probably best if we don't talk about this all right moving right along now he
[7128.40 --> 7132.32]  offended his entire viewer base this is exactly what steve gotto was talking about
[7133.92 --> 7135.76]  um i didn't put a title on it
[7138.48 --> 7142.56]  no i think i think i'm pretty much done let's just do this last thing so we're planning to head over to
[7142.56 --> 7147.20]  best buy or future shop at some point this weekend because this will only be applicable for canadians but
[7147.20 --> 7153.60]  this is like the stupidest promo that i've ever seen the new call of duty the new assassin's creed
[7153.60 --> 7161.04]  and the new battlefield titles are all available for a straight trade-in of any last gen console game
[7161.04 --> 7166.72]  it's only in canada and it's only in certain locations yes okay but that is any xbox 360
[7166.72 --> 7171.84]  ps3 or wii u game because they classify wii u as a last gen
[7171.84 --> 7180.24]  do they really i didn't read that part that's hilarious don't count wii u games count yeah so
[7180.24 --> 7186.40]  you can only do one at a time okay so but you can go in each day to a different store and you can
[7186.40 --> 7192.40]  exchange three games for all three of the new games and it can be like you know um battle mash cupcake
[7192.40 --> 7196.24]  2000 or whatever it doesn't matter you can bring in any game you want and you will get one of those
[7196.24 --> 7201.68]  games and they're trying to drive awareness of their games trade-in program because not everyone
[7201.68 --> 7205.84]  thinks of best buy future shop when they think of trading in games everyone thinks of best buy future
[7205.84 --> 7210.32]  shop that isn't a very nice thing to say about someone who's going to give you a free game tomorrow
[7212.08 --> 7216.16]  uh i will take it it doesn't mean i have to like them you'll take it but you won't have to like it
[7216.72 --> 7225.04]  i walked into that one that was bad you walked in backwards oh wow that wasn't even good i know that was
[7225.04 --> 7229.28]  just crude all right we're clearly getting close to the end of the show how about build logs of the
[7229.28 --> 7234.88]  week or something here take my laptop i shouldn't i shouldn't be operating any equipment this is
[7234.88 --> 7240.24]  obviously the case linus you're home go drunk i know right just i'm just gonna sit here and be sad
[7240.24 --> 7245.04]  for the rest of the stream oh wait you can't even do it on there because powerpoint but do i even have
[7245.04 --> 7250.08]  i thought you got powerpoint on here yes i do i do have it now okay you've had it for like months
[7250.08 --> 7254.80]  well define months two months oh no it doesn't work though because it came with a
[7254.80 --> 7259.84]  trial version and i installed an older version over top of it so like it takes forever to launch
[7259.84 --> 7264.56]  okay no no i'll pull up the build logs of the week okay i'll operate all the machinery don't
[7264.56 --> 7268.40]  worry everything will be okay this is why i love this show anything can happen
[7271.20 --> 7276.24]  the first one has a very inch actually they both have yeah never mind they both have completely
[7276.24 --> 7283.36]  ridiculous really interesting cases i think i set this up last week just as like a oh oh okay all the
[7283.36 --> 7290.64]  problems nope not set up nope not set up okay so we're gonna add a screen region here i'm just
[7290.64 --> 7294.40]  gonna do it this way this might be a little bit easier that might work actually that might be fine
[7294.96 --> 7302.48]  okay don't worry i'll fix that yeah no that's all the brokenness yeah there we go bill logs why am
[7302.48 --> 7309.44]  i still there go no no don't worry it's okay okay so uh next or wait yeah no you're oh what the
[7309.44 --> 7316.08]  why am i still there oh okay uh that okay well whatever you're the only one talking anyway scooch
[7316.08 --> 7323.60]  over there it's the slick show okay wow um jump into the thing so we go to the next slide oh you want
[7323.60 --> 7335.04]  me to go to the next slide hey it's mick lavin why is it so hard okay okay okay spandex n2 series primo
[7335.04 --> 7338.64]  that's like the first thing i really want to point out because when you see that picture that thing
[7338.64 --> 7343.60]  looks amazing yeah we have an unboxing coming when i get around to doing it oh nice i saw one in person
[7343.60 --> 7349.76]  today at the ncix studio it's kind of nice fandex been doing some really cool stuff um anyways you can
[7349.76 --> 7354.88]  see all the specs there and we're gonna move on to just some of the absolutely beautiful pictures
[7354.88 --> 7361.52]  that are that cable and tubing management holy cow and these these velcros are built in yep that's
[7361.52 --> 7366.48]  awesome it's so cool and i love how they're actually everywhere like corsair did that where they're up
[7366.48 --> 7371.04]  the one side for the 24 pin yes but they're all over the place which is sweet that's really cool and
[7371.04 --> 7374.56]  the amount of cable management space back here you don't even need a modular power supply and this thing's
[7374.56 --> 7379.36]  gonna look amazing because you could put like another power supply in there yeah it's just sick here's some
[7379.36 --> 7385.36]  close-up shots the guys oh man just it's just beautiful the way he did all the colors how it
[7385.36 --> 7389.68]  all goes in together and a lot of times we get bill logs on here where people use perfectly straight
[7389.68 --> 7395.28]  tubing everywhere that is a style but i don't think it's required and i think this guy did curved tubing
[7395.28 --> 7399.60]  in a really good way yep and you know what i like seeing builds where you know what look there's a
[7399.60 --> 7404.72]  wire here yeah deal with it because i actually hooked up the rig yeah that's one of the things that
[7404.72 --> 7409.12]  people will often criticize about my machine is like well there's still a lot of wire visible and i kind of go
[7409.12 --> 7414.96]  well yeah i have like a raid card with eight ssds and i have the fact that you see as few wires as
[7414.96 --> 7418.96]  you do is nothing short of a miracle because i actually have my front panel connectors hooked up
[7418.96 --> 7422.88]  and all this stuff so i'm hoping when mine's done i'll have a capture card a sound card a raid card
[7422.88 --> 7426.88]  and two graphics cards you may not need a capture card if shadow play a lot of shadow play works out
[7426.88 --> 7433.76]  yeah see but like that's going to be all the cables everywhere yeah like all right next one another
[7433.76 --> 7440.00]  crazy weird case so vector custom have been making uh pc table things i thought about buying this but
[7440.00 --> 7444.56]  it's like 3500 or something right or like 4500 i don't remember how much this is the commercially
[7444.56 --> 7447.76]  available one though right i think they only produced like 30 of them or something not very
[7447.76 --> 7453.76]  many and i was like oh this is real nice they're pretty freaking sweet and it saves you like making
[7453.76 --> 7459.52]  these desk computers the build logs are really long because they're really hard yeah really hard to make
[7459.52 --> 7464.48]  so it's interesting how you can just buy one um but they're still like yeah like i just said you
[7464.48 --> 7470.40]  can just buy one but like you still have to do all that to it like it's it's not exactly ready to go
[7472.08 --> 7477.44]  not so much so absolutely beautiful computer i love what the guy did with it it looks great look at
[7477.44 --> 7484.24]  that man so clean so again curved tubing you're going on a bit of a curved tubing thing that's interesting
[7484.24 --> 7490.56]  yeah yeah yeah dave saved my butt with this build log but yes i i don't know i like both of them it
[7490.56 --> 7494.80]  doesn't have to be straight tubes if it's done properly curved tubes can still look really good
