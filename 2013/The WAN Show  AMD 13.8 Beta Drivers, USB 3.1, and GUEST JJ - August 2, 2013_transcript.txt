[0.64 --> 5.68]  Welcome to the WAN show everyone those of you who are able to join us there are apparently some site
[6.58 --> 14.06]  Problems with twitch.tv right now, but if not beta dot twitch not beta see sometimes beta is better than non-beta
[14.06 --> 19.16]  Well because beta could potentially have a solid update that they just haven't finished testing yet
[19.16 --> 24.12]  Which doesn't have as many bugs whereas the site that they've been running all this time
[24.12 --> 32.00]  It's somehow broken. Speaking of beta guys don't forget that we are sponsored by Razer comms
[32.00 --> 36.30]  So you can click this bitly link right here to download Razer comms and check it out
[36.30 --> 42.70]  It's voice chat software that is optimized for gaming as opposed to optimized for talking to your grandmother like Skype
[42.70 --> 48.14]  I should be noted that the IP exploit is gone in Skype now as of the latest beta
[48.26 --> 50.42]  So I mean if we're going to compare beta software
[50.42 --> 57.14]  I guess we have to factor in that someone else's beta software which is also beta could be beta Lee fixed in a way that
[57.26 --> 61.16]  The other one was never broken but anyway, so comms isn't perfect
[61.16 --> 63.58]  It is in beta right now, but guys do check it out
[63.58 --> 70.60]  It has an over it has an overlay for in-game that is non intrusive and doesn't kill you the same way that other ones do and unlike
[70.60 --> 74.84]  Clients such as mumble or team speak you don't have to have a dedicated server
[74.84 --> 78.50]  In fact, you don't have to know a bloody thing about setting up almost anything
[78.50 --> 81.48]  Yeah, it's about as automatic as anything I've encountered
[81.48 --> 87.16]  So without further ado, let's do a quick overview of what's going to be going on today
[87.16 --> 89.02]  So JJ is our special guest
[89.02 --> 93.76]  He'll be joining us in probably actually not that long because we're quite late today. We're very sorry about that
[93.76 --> 96.42]  JJ from ASUS if anyone's wondering who JJ is
[96.42 --> 100.98]  Yeah, JJ from ASUS will be joining us on Razer comms. What else we got lined up for today?
[100.98 --> 107.72]  We've got pressure cooker rundowns on someone's house. We've got USB 3.0 getting a lot faster
[107.72 --> 109.64]  Like did you get my joke today?
[109.64 --> 111.50]  No, what was your joke?
[111.50 --> 116.84]  I said it was lightning speed lightnings. Oh, oh yes. Yes, I I did get that
[116.84 --> 121.76]  But then I forgot to actually say anything about it when we were filming netlinked, so I'm sorry
[121.76 --> 123.76]  That's okay. Um
[123.76 --> 125.76]  Yeah
[125.76 --> 127.76]  Yeah
[127.76 --> 134.86]  Just EA that is all AMD has released their 13.8 beta driver speaking of things that are in beta
[134.86 --> 141.04]  But could potentially make things a whole lot better it pretty much addresses
[141.68 --> 147.30]  sort of the problems with frame sort of dips and spikes and
[147.30 --> 151.46]  the problem with frame time so frame latency has been
[152.12 --> 157.62]  Sort of addressed more on that later, but without further ado this thing
[177.30 --> 191.30]  So I took that opportunity to take a couple of bites of food because I'm hungry and uh
[194.02 --> 196.66]  The obligatory slick has to mute his phone
[196.66 --> 202.48]  Yeah, I don't think you've actually managed to mute your phone before a show ever
[202.48 --> 204.48]  like
[204.48 --> 207.48]  Maybe once I'm not sure
[208.56 --> 210.56]  There we go
[210.56 --> 211.56]  Fixed all right
[211.56 --> 217.20]  Well, why don't we start with an easy topic before we introduce our our special guest and let's go with uh
[217.88 --> 220.98]  You said easy topic so I automatically assumed EA, but yeah
[220.98 --> 226.92]  Why don't we go back for EA early early in the show so this is an article from polygon.com?
[228.10 --> 233.22]  Former EA CEO, okay, so it's not actually quite EA
[234.42 --> 239.72]  Right because he's not with the a anymore, but when you're a former CEO you saw a huge attachment
[240.28 --> 244.76]  Yes, and and you when the things you say I mean if you say something like
[244.76 --> 250.84]  chasing console graphics like console grade graphics on mobile is a mistake
[251.40 --> 253.96]  Because and he goes on to say that
[255.08 --> 260.28]  Investing in better graphics without figuring out what differentiating gameplay you're going to have
[260.84 --> 265.24]  Without thinking of how gameplay rewards players is a road to ruin
[265.80 --> 269.96]  Prettier games cost more to make better games satisfy consumers
[269.96 --> 274.78]  So to imagine that this is something that he didn't know
[275.72 --> 278.20]  Very recently when he was still at EA
[279.00 --> 281.00]  Would be ridiculous
[282.82 --> 288.52]  With that said I agree with him yeah, but I think his former company is a perfect example of
[289.48 --> 294.68]  Like what what changes in a typical, you know NHL or Madden release?
[294.68 --> 302.04]  Usually just the graphics graphics I've heard that recently they've added a few things they change rosters
[302.84 --> 307.40]  Give them credit give them credit where credit is due is that is that's more NHL though
[308.12 --> 314.92]  Not like the NHL organization not EA because they have a partnership so NHL is like here's the new roster put this in your game, right?
[314.92 --> 316.92]  But EA does it
[317.48 --> 321.24]  Trying to try to play devil's advocate give them any credit you can yeah, yeah
[321.24 --> 327.56]  I'm trying to give them all the possible credit that could possibly be given to EA for doing anything whatsoever
[328.60 --> 329.32]  but um
[331.00 --> 333.00]  Yeah
[334.84 --> 338.60]  Um no, no, I don't think I don't think anything's wrong someone said
[340.36 --> 342.28]  Audio is fine. Oh
[342.84 --> 345.56]  saw two people say see we want audio audio
[347.56 --> 348.28]  Okay, echo
[348.28 --> 351.24]  Yeah, I don't know
[351.24 --> 353.32]  Uh most people say it's fine, so yeah
[353.64 --> 357.24]  So anyway, that's our that's our EA news of the week. We were actually discussing
[357.72 --> 361.72]  Um earlier this week. Maybe what we should do is we should have an actual dedicated show
[362.44 --> 368.20]  For just EA news of the week because it takes up a lot of time on the WAN show that we could spend talking about more important things
[368.20 --> 371.88]  And the thing is it's very consistent. It's almost like a segment like we have build logs
[371.88 --> 373.32]  EA news
[373.32 --> 375.24]  Yeah, yeah
[375.24 --> 379.00]  Yeah, we just segmented into its own show
[379.00 --> 383.48]  We could we we need like a little like intro for it. It should be like, uh, like, um
[384.36 --> 389.24]  I don't know just like a ball rolling down a hill and the hill is actually a stock thing
[389.24 --> 390.68]  And then it's like thumbs up
[390.68 --> 393.40]  Yeah, and it hits the thumbs up marker as it comes down
[393.40 --> 395.40]  Yeah, that could actually work that would be outstanding
[395.40 --> 401.96]  So I think without without further ado we should uh, we should welcome our special guest jj from asus
[401.96 --> 404.84]  Yeah, let's get him to uh, let's get him to call in here
[405.96 --> 408.28]  All right, so we're firing up razor comms
[409.32 --> 410.12]  getting uh
[411.00 --> 413.00]  here we go chat with friend
[414.44 --> 415.00]  and
[416.20 --> 418.20]  Starting the voice call
[418.20 --> 422.20]  In the meantime i'm gonna go ahead and add his little picture here
[423.16 --> 424.44]  Which is awesome by the way
[425.48 --> 427.32]  Yeah, there he is. That's the guy
[432.68 --> 435.72]  You are live sir welcome to the show
[439.64 --> 441.64]  Thank you for having me
[441.64 --> 451.88]  That is fantastic. It has been we have actually never had you as a guest before so we have had so much demand
[452.60 --> 460.28]  Why don't you start by introducing yourself to the members of our audience who don't know who you are in spite of your phenomenal internet celebrity?
[460.68 --> 462.68]  And then we'll go from there
[465.96 --> 467.24]  Um
[467.32 --> 469.16]  Wow, that's a that's a lot to say
[469.16 --> 473.96]  Uh, well first off just uh, thanks for having me on the show appreciate it guys. Um, it's very cool of you
[474.68 --> 478.76]  Um, so for you guys that might know or might not know i'm pretty much I work for asus
[479.48 --> 482.52]  So specifically what I do is I handle their technical marketing
[483.24 --> 487.48]  And what that pretty much falls into is covering their core component series of products
[487.80 --> 491.48]  So at the at the end of the day what that essentially means is things like the motherboards
[491.96 --> 496.20]  The gpus server and workstation products storage multimedia networking
[496.20 --> 500.68]  It's been a lot of different product over the entire time that i've been with the company which has now been about five years
[501.16 --> 506.36]  Um, and now really my focus is uh started to shift to pretty much focus in on just kind of the gpus
[506.68 --> 510.76]  Um and to the motherboard line and actually fairly soon
[510.76 --> 513.80]  I'll actually be transitioning into a little bit of a different world within the company as well
[514.20 --> 517.96]  But i'll still definitely be working with a lot of the community where a lot of my passion lies in
[518.20 --> 523.08]  In terms of providing great information and great insight into what I think that we're doing in terms of our products
[523.08 --> 526.20]  So, um, hopefully that gives you a little bit more insight into who I am
[526.52 --> 529.24]  Um, you know the last point I guess i'll make is one that I think um
[529.72 --> 532.68]  I find interesting about myself, which is I don't come from a marketing background
[533.40 --> 539.80]  Classically the people in my position usually major in some form of marketing and college and things along those lines my background's actually in
[540.52 --> 545.48]  Engineering consultation system integration. So it's a it's much more kind of hands-on real-world usage
[545.96 --> 549.32]  Than it would historically be for somebody in my per se position
[550.12 --> 554.76]  Well, that makes a lot of sense because the way that you've typically approached marketing
[555.40 --> 557.48]  At least working behind the scenes with us
[557.48 --> 563.56]  So to give the viewers some perspective jj and I have probably only been in direct communication for the last
[563.80 --> 566.92]  I don't know maybe a year and a half maybe two years sound about right
[567.80 --> 569.16]  That sounds about right
[569.16 --> 570.28]  Yeah, and uh
[570.28 --> 577.08]  Basically the way that he approaches marketing is not a marketing approach so rather than worry too much about
[577.08 --> 580.20]  Um, I think a great example would be something like htc
[580.68 --> 586.52]  Where they take their new camera technology and they branded ultra pixel and that's more of a marketing thing
[586.92 --> 592.20]  Whereas when you actually get on the phone with someone technical and they go and they actually explain
[592.52 --> 597.80]  Well the way that the light hits the pixels the larger size pixels are able to capture more light and they're able to
[598.20 --> 602.04]  resolve more detail in a lower light situation compared to
[602.04 --> 608.04]  Having more megapixels is more better and that mistaken mentality that every competitor is
[608.92 --> 615.96]  Sort of still stuck in so so jj takes a very realistic approach to asus products and maybe you can explain to us
[616.28 --> 619.40]  Why asus because i'm sure you've had other offers
[620.36 --> 627.16]  Um, yeah, actually, you know, uh, I guess for a lot of people it's interesting. Um, you know why i've end up being here and
[627.16 --> 630.36]  Um, you know now being with actually the company for almost five years
[630.36 --> 635.88]  I guess that's a really good question to ask and I actually I came from a background where I guess from a financial perspective
[635.88 --> 642.04]  Actually, I was even quote unquote making more money and I had uh even more control over a lot of different variables and things along those lines
[642.36 --> 646.28]  But you know, um, I you know for for for me personally
[646.28 --> 649.64]  It was a question of being closer to something that i'm extremely passionate about
[649.88 --> 652.20]  I think most of the people that are really interested in
[652.20 --> 657.16]  um technology and especially the pc diy space are it's something that you know
[657.16 --> 663.40]  It's kind of part of the ethos of who you are and what you're interested in and having the opportunity to work for a component vendor
[663.72 --> 668.20]  Especially a component vendor like asus when I had the chance to move back to the bay area
[668.44 --> 671.56]  And I found that there was an opening for that I said that that's what I want to do
[671.96 --> 676.60]  Um, you know is to be able to work for a company that I thought was making great product and product that I had worked with
[677.16 --> 679.80]  from the very beginning from my very first system build that I had done
[679.80 --> 686.52]  To when I was doing private consultation and integration just kind of made me have a bigger level of affinity and passion and interest for it
[686.52 --> 692.92]  And I said if I can get that much closer to it never thinking that I was ultimately going to have the opportunity to work directly with our rmd team
[693.16 --> 698.12]  Our management product development team at being able to influence product designs be able to work with you know
[698.12 --> 700.68]  technical media and users themselves and
[700.76 --> 704.84]  Collecting all that to be able to bring out I think you know really awesome and innovative product
[704.84 --> 707.48]  Um, I didn't think that was what was it going to turn into
[707.48 --> 710.28]  Um, but that's what it did turn into and I'm thankful for it
[710.28 --> 714.20]  And I'm very lucky and most people probably wouldn't say this of their management staff
[714.20 --> 717.32]  But I'm actually very thankful to our management staff that said hey
[717.32 --> 720.92]  We're willing to take a risk on somebody that essentially has no marketing experience at all
[721.64 --> 724.76]  But has true passion and insight and an understanding of the product
[725.32 --> 731.72]  To put that out there to a community of users that in reality have a lot of the time been not treated well, right?
[731.72 --> 735.88]  A lot of the time companies treat these users with a lack of understanding and appreciation
[735.88 --> 739.56]  And they were willing to say let's put somebody in there that himself
[740.04 --> 742.44]  Is an enthusiast and somebody that's passionate about the hardware
[742.44 --> 746.44]  So that's why I continue to stay here because I feel that from a top to bottom perspective
[746.84 --> 749.48]  Um, you know, we're committed to to putting out great product
[749.48 --> 752.12]  Uh, it doesn't mean that every single time we're going to make something that's perfect
[752.44 --> 753.64]  And that's the reality, you know
[754.36 --> 758.20]  Doing things that are new and different and interesting doesn't mean that you get it right every single time
[758.68 --> 763.08]  But um, you know, you have to put the effort at trying something new and different
[763.08 --> 767.00]  To keep refining to make things better well to be perfectly honest
[767.00 --> 767.24]  I mean
[767.24 --> 771.40]  I think a great example of that would be the first rog board was frankly not very good
[771.96 --> 778.76]  Um, whereas here we are six generations or seven generations depending on how you want to count it in
[779.40 --> 786.20]  And there's not really much debate that however much it may cost or you know, whatever other factors there may be
[786.60 --> 788.60]  It's hard to get a better motherboard
[788.60 --> 794.36]  Well, I thank you for that and I think that ultimately that comes through the time the work and the effort that we put into it
[794.36 --> 799.00]  You know, um, like you said we haven't had a huge amount of opportunity to have face-to-face contact
[799.00 --> 803.80]  But we were really excited when we got the chance to invite you out to like our z87 technical summit
[803.80 --> 806.20]  Which in itself is very different than I think a lot of the
[806.76 --> 812.12]  um presentations that motherboard vendors give and it's interesting because you made a comment on the last one
[812.76 --> 817.24]  Um, we were talking about a user was asking about overclock ability on different motherboards
[817.24 --> 821.72]  And one of the things that we were adamant to show there at the show was fundamentally that
[822.28 --> 825.64]  Excuse me at the technical summit was hey everything from our z87 dash a
[826.04 --> 832.44]  130 140 dollar motherboard was offering the same overclocking capability as our flagship maximus extreme board
[832.84 --> 836.92]  Right, and that's something that we didn't want to share away from right and that's not something normally
[837.56 --> 841.40]  Traditionally a company is going to come out and tell you right saying that you're getting no it's really not
[842.20 --> 846.20]  From your high-end product versus your your entry-level product, right?
[846.20 --> 851.72]  Um, but where our focus is has been is that shouldn't be a point of differential between a product and and
[852.36 --> 856.36]  And what it's offering you that should be a non-negotiable in terms of the expectation of the performance
[856.68 --> 858.68]  Right, it should be like you've discussed
[859.24 --> 862.04]  What's the usability right are you do you care about audio?
[862.04 --> 864.76]  Do you care about having integrated high-performance wireless, right?
[864.76 --> 867.24]  Do you want more expansion? Do you need supplemental storage?
[867.48 --> 873.80]  Those should be the dictating factors at why you pick one board over another board or the segmentational form factor considerations, right?
[873.80 --> 876.60]  Do I want to build a cool small form factor steam box?
[876.92 --> 879.08]  You know do I want to build a really cool xmb
[879.56 --> 885.64]  You know small media server, right or do I want to build you know a box that I just want to play with and I want to run linux distros on
[885.88 --> 888.04]  Right, it might be any one of those variations
[888.36 --> 891.16]  But ultimately that's why you should be picking your platform not because
[891.56 --> 895.64]  You think that one is going to be somehow more reliable or more stable or better overclocking
[896.12 --> 899.24]  You know there's going to always be a couple of little pieces of information that
[899.24 --> 902.36]  Change things across the board, but you know, uh
[903.08 --> 908.92]  We're very happy about the position that we've put our product in and we're happy that you guys yourselves as well as users have responded to that
[909.64 --> 916.44]  Now I get this sort of ties into a couple of the things and I think you were going to talk about a product here on the stream today
[917.00 --> 922.84]  That our users are going to be pretty excited about and might come might be in line with what you were saying about
[923.08 --> 925.48]  Steam box and small form factor and all that cool stuff
[925.48 --> 931.08]  But I want to talk about sort of the philosophy of treating the users as enthusiasts
[931.64 --> 935.16]  There's a few things that intel's done and you know feel free to
[935.80 --> 938.76]  To not say anything that you feel like you're not allowed to say
[939.24 --> 943.88]  But there's a few things that intel's done over the last few years that have felt like they went from
[944.36 --> 950.12]  Catering to the enthusiast to not catering to the enthusiast you look back even five years ago
[950.12 --> 958.28]  And intel was going as far as to cherry-pick review samples in order to impress the enthusiast
[958.84 --> 963.56]  And on the one hand you could say it's great that intel doesn't do that anymore
[964.20 --> 971.96]  But on the other hand you could also say is it because they don't feel it's ethical or is it because they actually don't give two shakes of a rat's bum?
[971.96 --> 978.52]  Anymore about what the enthusiast thinks about the new processor because they're more concerned with the power efficiency or the
[979.32 --> 980.68]  you know
[980.68 --> 983.40]  Yeah power efficiency and the onboard graphics
[984.04 --> 991.88]  And those kinds of things and the other thing is to be the other evidence for this is what is intel's enthusiast platform anymore?
[992.28 --> 998.68]  LGA 2011 lacks a great deal of functionality compared to the mainstream LGA 1150
[998.68 --> 1005.32]  It has no quick sync. It has no thunderbolt. It has no sub no official support for higher speed memory
[1005.72 --> 1010.52]  No smart response technology. It has more say to three more USB 3
[1011.88 --> 1018.20]  What from the motherboard side? What do you make of all this and how does asus try to be different from that?
[1019.48 --> 1021.40]  So that's a there's a lot of questions in there
[1021.40 --> 1024.20]  So we'll try to answer my guess in the order that came in
[1024.20 --> 1028.92]  So I guess the first one in relation to enthusiasts, you know, I think a lot of this is um
[1029.72 --> 1031.88]  A relative to kind of how you perceive things, you know
[1031.88 --> 1034.76]  I've been in the the game long enough to know
[1035.08 --> 1040.44]  What it was like when you had to you know move every single jumper on a board and manually set rq settings
[1040.92 --> 1043.56]  Just to be able to get an adding card to work correctly, right?
[1044.12 --> 1046.36]  You know when you had to manually switch
[1046.76 --> 1049.96]  Jumpers just to be able to shift the front side bus of operation, right?
[1050.52 --> 1054.60]  So if you look at the way that I think intel actually has support the enthusiast
[1055.16 --> 1061.16]  And by enthusiasts let's relative relate this to overclocking specifically because I think sometimes people use the enthusiast term
[1061.56 --> 1064.36]  To be really broad sweeping right to cover a lot of different things
[1064.36 --> 1066.60]  But I think right here we're talking about overclocking and
[1067.24 --> 1070.20]  It's never been easier to overclock a platform than right now
[1070.52 --> 1076.20]  And and that's inherently through a huge amount of the effort that intel has put into the architectural designs of these cpu parts
[1076.44 --> 1083.00]  Now some people might not like that to the segmentation has gotten more narrow right in terms that the cpu might have
[1083.16 --> 1088.36]  Been adjusted to only certain cpu samples have overclocking capability versus a larger amount
[1088.68 --> 1091.56]  But if we take a look at the fundamental ease of the experience
[1091.88 --> 1098.36]  It's unquestionably the easiest that it's ever been for somebody to come in and be able to overclock a system to a high degree
[1098.68 --> 1101.96]  And be able to have a whole nother level of performance available to them
[1101.96 --> 1106.52]  So me personally, I I don't view it that way. I think that the focus has become
[1107.40 --> 1113.72]  More specific and more targeted to really serving a set of skews to an audience that exists and knowing that segmentation
[1114.44 --> 1118.84]  And not really over designing a product for a majority of a market that might not utilize it, right?
[1119.08 --> 1121.64]  Would it really make sense to design 10 k skews?
[1121.96 --> 1124.20]  I don't think so because in in reality
[1124.20 --> 1128.60]  Most of those k skews are going into systems that are never going to be overclocked. I mean right now
[1128.60 --> 1134.68]  Probably a good balance right now where it used to be actually this is a good point because that was around five years ago
[1134.68 --> 1140.84]  They had extreme edition which was a thousand dollars and then everything else was not really overclocking optimized in any way
[1142.12 --> 1145.08]  Yeah, no, I think you're right. So I think it's a pretty good balance
[1145.08 --> 1148.20]  I mean, I think i'd love to maybe see one more k part, you know
[1148.20 --> 1154.84]  And maybe a little bit more price aggressive point. So maybe something like like a hundred and twenty five dollar k part just to make it kind of really fun
[1154.84 --> 1157.88]  Maybe like a dual core. Yeah, something like that, you know
[1157.88 --> 1161.24]  Just to make it interesting for somebody to play around with a little bit more
[1161.48 --> 1165.00]  But overall i i'm okay with the positioning. I mean if we take a look
[1165.00 --> 1168.20]  We've got pretty good to price diversity at about the you know
[1168.20 --> 1173.00]  225 to 250 dollar price point all the way up to a thousand dollars of overclocked parts
[1173.80 --> 1177.16]  Now on the chipset side, I think that comes to an architectural focus
[1177.64 --> 1182.36]  The x79 platform is a beast of a platform when you're talking about the amount of cores cache
[1182.36 --> 1184.84]  PCI lanes and memory bandwidth that it has
[1185.56 --> 1189.16]  But it's also such a complex platform that it's not a platform that you can
[1190.20 --> 1192.76]  Spin a dime on every year and re-transition
[1193.08 --> 1197.40]  So with that you're going to sometimes have to have certain things that change from from year to year
[1197.56 --> 1200.20]  More quickly on other cycles that won't always change
[1200.44 --> 1205.72]  But that's where we come in as a motherboard vendor and we can figure out ways to enrich the chipset and give you more value
[1205.72 --> 1210.04]  Right whether that's adding in those supplemental sata controllers adding in my sp3
[1210.04 --> 1214.04]  Adding an improved sound or integrated wireless technologies, whatever it might be
[1214.04 --> 1218.84]  That's our job to make it worth your while to say that when you invest in a platform. You're not just investing
[1219.56 --> 1225.48]  Just to get that specific specification, but you're investing to get other functions and features right like z87 right?
[1225.48 --> 1227.88]  You know it's got a ton of different stuff, but we
[1228.44 --> 1232.20]  Implemented support for like nfc because we saw nfc was becoming more popular
[1232.84 --> 1235.96]  With mobile peripherals right whether like smartphones or tablets, right?
[1235.96 --> 1239.48]  So we said hey, let's make it that much better that if you're also going to buy a new chipset
[1239.48 --> 1242.28]  You're probably one of those people. It's also buying a latest generation smartphone
[1242.52 --> 1248.36]  So wouldn't you like to be able to maybe quick log on your system or like launch 10 programs in the swipe, you know or something like that?
[1248.36 --> 1253.96]  So, you know, I think you know keep in mind that there is going to be a transitional refresh for x79
[1254.04 --> 1259.80]  But when it comes down to it, it's about usage model, right? You know, um when you talk about storage. Yes, this
[1259.80 --> 1264.28]  The zc okay, we're gonna geek out a little bit here, but on z
[1264.92 --> 1269.00]  Z87 the pch might have six out of 60 ports natively
[1269.32 --> 1274.60]  But the aggregated throughput that it offers is only going to be about 1.3 to 1.6 gigabytes
[1274.84 --> 1278.92]  That means that if even you took barely three high performance status
[1278.92 --> 1284.28]  60 ssds and you rated them you would sequentially max the throughput out on the pch even though there's six
[1284.60 --> 1287.32]  Satis 60 ports so that is a very good point
[1287.32 --> 1290.76]  In fact, we have an upcoming video where we're taking four ssds
[1291.08 --> 1297.64]  And we're going to find out when we hit that internal bottleneck and how hard we hit it as in sort of in terms of pure numbers
[1298.04 --> 1303.00]  Four four drives already puts you over that saturation point so you can't even take advantage of them readily
[1303.56 --> 1307.00]  And the people that really want that level of class of performance guess what what are you doing?
[1307.00 --> 1309.00]  You're buying a high performance
[1309.00 --> 1314.60]  You know lsi or a high point or adaptic or intel raid controller because you want that load balancing
[1314.60 --> 1317.40]  You want the better throughput you want the better performance you want all that good stuff
[1317.88 --> 1323.08]  And if you're doing that you're going to need a z or you're going to need an x79 because you're going to need
[1323.48 --> 1331.24]  A pci express 4x or pci express 8x slot. You got it that actually has 4x worth of bandwidth or 8x worth of bandwidth
[1332.28 --> 1336.28]  Maybe talk a little bit exactly you want all those lanes. Yeah, you nailed it on the head
[1336.28 --> 1341.00]  That's what you and that's what it comes down to is we just need to balance out realizing that
[1341.00 --> 1346.84]  There are different usage models for different platforms and it gets back to where we talked about picking the board
[1346.84 --> 1349.32]  Pick the board based on what you're going to do with your system
[1349.48 --> 1352.76]  I'm sure you guys get inundated with questions like this just like I get questions
[1353.08 --> 1357.64]  Um, you know people say what should I buy? What should I build and the first thing you always end up asking?
[1357.88 --> 1359.88]  What are you going to do with your system?
[1360.12 --> 1363.40]  So here's something i'd like to get your take on because I
[1363.72 --> 1368.92]  I think i've made my feelings on pcie lane splitters pretty clear in the past
[1368.92 --> 1370.92]  Um, I think they're ridiculous
[1371.56 --> 1377.16]  Because basically you're adding latency and in terms of if you're if we're going to talk about something like okay
[1377.16 --> 1380.04]  You can add as many sata 6 ports to a board as you want
[1380.60 --> 1387.72]  But if the total maximum throughput at some other point in the chain is limited to about what you could do on three of them
[1387.72 --> 1389.72]  If you were actually using them all at the same time
[1390.12 --> 1395.80]  How much good does something like a pcie lane splitter do if it's not actually increasing
[1395.80 --> 1400.28]  The bandwidth available to your graphics cards further on up the chain?
[1401.80 --> 1405.32]  I think you know once again, this is a about usage model because
[1405.96 --> 1410.92]  When you use a multiplexing chip, let's say like a plx or what in the past might have been like an nf 200
[1411.24 --> 1413.72]  It's not always about just graphics, right?
[1413.88 --> 1416.52]  So an example might be like our z87 deluxe board
[1416.60 --> 1420.44]  It's got a plx on there, but the board doesn't support three-way and four-way sli
[1421.16 --> 1427.88]  Why because that plx is there for concurrent pcie controller utilization what that just means frankly and easily
[1428.20 --> 1432.36]  Is that if i'm going to put the board in sli and crossfire, but also want to use the tool nix
[1432.92 --> 1438.36]  That we've put on there simultaneously plus my supplemental sata 6g controller and my wi-fi all at the same time
[1438.36 --> 1440.60]  I need more lanes than what the cpu can provide
[1441.32 --> 1445.32]  So sometimes it's not just a question about giving me more lanes just for pure graphics
[1445.32 --> 1449.72]  It might be what's once again the usage model of my system and the person that buys the deluxe board
[1450.04 --> 1452.68]  Is going to need to have more pcie lanes available to them
[1453.00 --> 1457.88]  Then they would be if they bought like the z87 dash a because maybe that person doesn't need a to deliver an ac
[1458.12 --> 1461.16]  They don't need bluetooth. They're not going to run a discrete sound card
[1461.40 --> 1466.84]  So it kind of varies in that um and also to your question on the latency or other things like that
[1467.64 --> 1472.44]  That's also the obligation to be intelligent as a board vendor on how you implement the plx
[1472.44 --> 1477.56]  You know we've talked about this like on a board with like the maximus where we've set it up that
[1477.88 --> 1484.36]  Under any configuration even if you go four lanes that top pci express slot is always mapped directly to the cpu
[1484.76 --> 1488.12]  So you actually never introduce latency to the primary graphics card
[1488.36 --> 1494.68]  So there's always ways for a vendor to figure out what's the best way versus the easiest way to implement something
[1494.92 --> 1498.52]  And that's what you know at least we feel that we take more time and effort to do is
[1498.52 --> 1503.08]  To kind of figure out how do we really make the best usage implementation for this
[1503.48 --> 1506.52]  Uh for the the community that wants to build on that because at the end of the day
[1506.68 --> 1511.08]  You're going to have somebody that wants to for whatever reason run four gpus on a z87 system
[1511.32 --> 1515.64]  Even though you could natively run those gpus also on an x79 box because like you said
[1515.64 --> 1518.84]  Maybe they want the additional usb3 ports for whatever it is
[1519.64 --> 1524.04]  And that's interesting to talk about because a lot of people look at a motherboard go oh, there's all those slots
[1524.04 --> 1529.08]  I can fill all of them with anything I want there'll be no problems. I see that all the time on the forum
[1529.08 --> 1531.08]  I see that all the time on every forum
[1531.08 --> 1538.76]  It's kind of depressing, but it's a thing and I mean jj's point is very good because just because you have your supplemental SATA controller
[1538.76 --> 1544.36]  You have your wireless ac you have your graphics cards if you're using some kind of a splitter
[1544.84 --> 1549.72]  Then the odds of you actually hammering all of those devices all at the same time
[1549.72 --> 1555.88]  I guess is probably pretty slim so just because the bandwidth on this side of the splitter doesn't actually match how much
[1556.20 --> 1558.20]  Virtual bandwidth there is on this side
[1559.16 --> 1562.36]  You'll probably never realize it as long as you're not again
[1562.36 --> 1570.60]  So I think jj's uh way of wording that was outstanding if you're for whatever reason putting four graphics cards on a z87 platform
[1571.32 --> 1573.32]  That's exactly it for whatever reason
[1573.32 --> 1579.32]  It's the correct platform for the correct usage model and that's what we all need to remember and I think that some manufacturers
[1579.72 --> 1583.56]  Approach these pci express lane splitters as a marketing bullet point
[1584.12 --> 1586.20]  Yeah, I definitely agree with that
[1586.76 --> 1593.88]  Where and I think nvidia treats it that way a little bit as well where they require pci express 8x functionality
[1594.44 --> 1599.48]  But then they they were the ones who started this business with nf 200
[1599.96 --> 1603.16]  Where they they're creating sort of an artificial
[1603.16 --> 1608.28]  Speck that's not that's not really real because it's not about
[1608.92 --> 1612.60]  Uh the actual throughput that can be delivered to and from the graphics cards
[1612.60 --> 1619.72]  It's about just playing that game of how many pci express slots this motherboard has even if it's really not intended to be used that way
[1620.60 --> 1624.52]  Yeah, I mean it's you know, it's really tricky a lot of these things ultimately come down to
[1625.00 --> 1628.92]  um getting the right information and this is where I give you a lot of respect
[1628.92 --> 1634.68]  Um, because you know, you've been one of the best people that i've worked with in terms of just taking the time to listen to information
[1634.68 --> 1639.32]  You know ultimately you're going to bring your experience your insight your passion into
[1639.88 --> 1643.16]  um, you know the information that you put out to you know your viewers and your readers
[1644.12 --> 1648.76]  But it still takes somebody that's big at saying hey, I don't realize I know everything
[1649.00 --> 1653.08]  And let me get as much information as I can before I put an opinion out there to try to find
[1653.08 --> 1659.40]  The right balance of it because especially within this industry. There's a lot of stuff that gets put out there. That's just flat out wrong
[1659.72 --> 1664.92]  And this is permutates in the industry of permutates in these forums
[1665.00 --> 1669.24]  It permutates in all these little crevices and corners of the internet and before you know it
[1669.24 --> 1674.36]  You got people talking the things that are totally wrong or incorrect or not factual and uh
[1674.36 --> 1678.36]  It ends up just being this kind of like regurgitating cycle of insanity
[1678.36 --> 1683.48]  It drives me crazy information because there isn't even any consistency to the wrongness
[1684.04 --> 1692.92]  You'll find a thread where people will be saying, you know, um analog or onboard audio is just as good as discrete audio
[1693.32 --> 1697.88]  And then in the same thread you'll have someone saying oh, but if you want to, uh, you know
[1697.88 --> 1702.04]  Use a digital output make sure you get a great sound card to which i'm sitting there going
[1703.16 --> 1706.92]  You're wrong and then you're wrong and you're both wrong together, but separately and I
[1706.92 --> 1708.92]  To defend the people though
[1708.92 --> 1714.44]  At a lot of points in time if you're not super entwined with everything it's hard to find the right answer
[1714.44 --> 1719.48]  So you go and you know you're find the wrong answer and then perpetuate it and then it just becomes a giant problem
[1719.80 --> 1725.08]  You're you're 100% right and that's why like I said I gave props to you know to linus um because
[1726.04 --> 1729.32]  You know this is this is my in my position
[1729.40 --> 1732.84]  This is what i'm supposed to do is i'm supposed to help you know, um
[1732.84 --> 1737.16]  The the reviewers understand more about our product because if we know more about the product
[1737.56 --> 1743.32]  Um, you know, we should be able to convey that now sadly the truth is not every company has somebody like myself
[1743.32 --> 1746.28]  That's close and really passionate about the hardware to inform correctly
[1751.00 --> 1753.00]  So that's kind of one thing that happens
[1753.00 --> 1756.60]  Um, but then second to that, you know is is that to be honest
[1756.60 --> 1762.84]  It's it's really the obligation I feel of the reviewers to step up to the plate and realize that you guys have a commitment to your audience
[1763.08 --> 1769.16]  To say we have to respect them and ensure the information that we put out there is right and accurate and not just what's easy
[1769.48 --> 1773.32]  Um, and that that could help to mitigate some of this bad information flow
[1773.32 --> 1776.28]  It's never going to stop right because there's there's a lot of marketing
[1776.44 --> 1778.28]  There's a lot of information that gets put out there
[1778.60 --> 1782.76]  But you know everybody needs to do their part, you know the users have to research better
[1782.76 --> 1787.72]  The reviewers have to take more time and effort and vendors need to be better at putting out the right information
[1788.28 --> 1793.72]  All right, so jj if you've watched the wan show before you might be familiar with this already, but i'm going to go ahead and
[1794.36 --> 1797.88]  Explain it anyway, so we do segments that we call twitter blitz
[1798.28 --> 1803.72]  Where the objective is to answer the question as quickly as humanly possible
[1804.28 --> 1809.88]  And I have actually been in the background asking for our twitter followers to use hashtag
[1809.88 --> 1816.12]  Ask jj so i'm only going to take the ones from the people who were already paying attention to twitter here
[1816.60 --> 1820.60]  And I would like you to uh to blitz through some of these for them
[1820.84 --> 1824.60]  So uh this one I really liked is the tough series motherboards
[1825.24 --> 1832.76]  Close to the enthusiast level or okay. I okay the grammar the grammar is terrible yassi dude. It's okay. I understand
[1832.92 --> 1838.04]  I'm going to rephrase it. I got it tough series. Okay. JJ's got it. You can read it there
[1838.04 --> 1845.08]  Okay, so long story short the overall quality is very very close to that of the rog
[1845.56 --> 1849.32]  Technically rog is going to have a little bit higher end components
[1849.88 --> 1855.64]  But in terms of the overall quality quality functionality overclock ability they're going to pretty much be identical
[1855.96 --> 1859.96]  The main difference is going to be rog will have a specialized set of features
[1860.60 --> 1862.60]  That's more targeted for improved audio
[1862.92 --> 1866.92]  networking and some esoteric overclocking options and what I mean by esoteric
[1866.92 --> 1871.88]  Is for the guys that want to get into the nitty and gritty this is not for the normal people that are interested in saying
[1871.88 --> 1876.12]  I want 4.6 4.7 4.8 this is for the people that I care about
[1876.52 --> 1884.04]  Adjusting tertiary level d ram timings. I want to be able to modify pll voltages because I care about making my you know voltage for my cpu
[1884.36 --> 1886.92]  You know point two millivolts slightly reduced
[1887.00 --> 1891.08]  But I want the options to try to figure that out and I'm willing to spend two more hours to get there
[1891.08 --> 1894.68]  So that's really where the differentials but in term be
[1895.48 --> 1897.72]  There's it's you're not getting an inferior product
[1898.52 --> 1900.52]  Okay, great answer
[1901.64 --> 1903.64]  Any new sound cards on the way?
[1903.96 --> 1911.00]  Oh, yeah, definitely if you checked out actually in the show notes, um, i'm actually testing right now our zonar essence stu
[1911.72 --> 1915.56]  USB so this is going to actually be kind of like the zonar stx
[1915.56 --> 1922.44]  But it will be a usb edition of this sound card. So i've been really really happy with it. I'm really excited about it
[1922.92 --> 1925.56]  Um, and that's gonna be not too far away
[1925.56 --> 1929.40]  It'll be probably maybe towards the end of this quarter that'll be coming out. It's pretty badass
[1929.96 --> 1936.36]  Um, so i'm pretty excited about that. I've also been testing out a smaller kind of uh in between model
[1936.60 --> 1938.52]  Uh, you you've had the zonar u3
[1938.84 --> 1944.76]  We're coming out with a zonar u7 which is kind of in between this and then a zonar essence stu
[1945.08 --> 1947.80]  So we'll have kind of those two models and then uh
[1948.36 --> 1955.40]  Stack will be then zonar u3 for that super compact external sound which by the way for those of you who aren't familiar with the zone
[1955.40 --> 1956.12]  Are you three?
[1956.12 --> 1962.84]  It's a great option for laptop users both slick and I give it a wholehearted two thumbs up and have used it quite a bit and have used
[1962.84 --> 1969.16]  It quite a bit. It's we've used it not only to improve audio quality where necessary, but also to improve compatibility
[1969.64 --> 1974.36]  Because sometimes the onboard audio solutions have problems that go beyond that they sound like but
[1974.84 --> 1979.40]  And it's like they operate like but so using using the u3 is great
[1979.80 --> 1984.04]  And then at the very very high end there's the essence one which is like a 700
[1984.84 --> 1986.84]  DAC and amp
[1987.08 --> 1990.20]  Well, there's two yeah, there's the muse there is the muses edition
[1990.68 --> 1995.08]  Which is the really high-end one and then there's the standard essence one. They're both the same and uh
[1995.08 --> 2002.20]  I can't talk about it, but let's just say there'll be something that passes even the essence one uses edition
[2003.16 --> 2004.36]  oh
[2004.36 --> 2011.40]  All right. Well, there you go guys you heard it here on the wanshow first going from two models for external sound cards
[2011.40 --> 2013.40]  To four well, okay
[2013.40 --> 2016.52]  So three models if you want to count muses and essence one is two separate ones
[2016.52 --> 2021.08]  But up to six sometime in the sort of next little bit here. That's exciting. Yeah
[2021.88 --> 2023.88]  All right, let's do our next one
[2023.88 --> 2029.00]  Um, what's up with that rog air slash water cool gtx graphics card?
[2029.00 --> 2034.28]  Oh man, everybody's been asking me about that thing. Um, so the poseidon i've actually been doing testing on it
[2034.28 --> 2036.76]  um, I right now have a prototype sample
[2036.92 --> 2041.88]  Um, it's pretty awesome. Um, I can't go into too much details about it because we're trying to keep it a little bit
[2042.20 --> 2044.68]  You know kind of uh, you know behind the scenes
[2045.40 --> 2047.40]  man
[2047.48 --> 2051.32]  It's a it's a great card. Um, it's it's cool everything works
[2051.32 --> 2057.32]  I mean, I think the thing that's going to be coolest is is that that flexibility right you've got just like our formula series motherboard
[2057.32 --> 2060.68]  You can run it passively or you can run it underwater. So it's your choice
[2060.68 --> 2063.08]  So you got that great flexibility of doing either or so
[2063.32 --> 2068.12]  If you first going to start off in an air-cold rig, but you think you know, maybe six down down six months down the road
[2068.12 --> 2071.00]  You're going to maybe upgrade into water cooling. It's a really nice option
[2071.96 --> 2078.84]  You know, it's not the first time it's been done. I remember cooler master of all people had uh a gtx
[2079.08 --> 2082.68]  8800 or there see i'm i'm it's so long ago
[2083.24 --> 2085.88]  8800 gtx 8800 ultra cooler
[2085.88 --> 2092.52]  That had like this weird solution where it was actually just a reference cooler and then it just had like
[2093.24 --> 2099.80]  A heat pipe that wasn't sealed anymore that was connected to like some weird like fittings on the top of it
[2100.12 --> 2105.56]  So you guys obviously looked at products like that in the past. What did you do to make poseidon different?
[2105.96 --> 2109.08]  Well, we've actually had products like this in the past. Uh, we have to go way back
[2109.08 --> 2115.08]  But uh, if users that are diehard asus followers, they'll remember asus graphics card series that were underneath the magic
[2115.48 --> 2116.28]  line
[2116.28 --> 2121.24]  Uh, we actually did or we had models that actually were water cooled models as well
[2121.48 --> 2122.44]  But for this generation
[2122.44 --> 2128.60]  I really think that the big thing is and the hard thing anytime you create a dual design is making sure that it works
[2129.32 --> 2133.72]  Under both right is that it's easy to make it great work great if it's just water cooling
[2133.96 --> 2138.28]  But it's not so easy if you also want it to work really well in terms of the air performance
[2138.28 --> 2142.20]  It's for past duration or or under an air cool
[2142.52 --> 2147.56]  So, you know, we've probably been working on the design for almost a year about the same length of time
[2147.56 --> 2150.12]  That it took us to develop that 10 millimeter heat pipe
[2150.60 --> 2154.44]  That you took a look at on that big fat gtx 780 dc2 card
[2154.84 --> 2158.20]  So it's just that's really the hard stuff is we go through maybe about
[2159.16 --> 2164.04]  Six to seven sometimes prototype samples revising the design trying to find a balance
[2164.04 --> 2169.80]  It's it's it's tricky work, but you know, that's what makes a good product stand out right is attention to detail, right?
[2170.28 --> 2170.84]  Next twitter
[2170.84 --> 2171.88]  Oh, sorry go ahead
[2171.88 --> 2176.12]  That matters going through different prototype stages because a lot of companies will just be like
[2176.36 --> 2178.36]  Oh, it costs a lot to make another one
[2178.36 --> 2178.92]  So that works
[2178.92 --> 2180.28]  And it does cost a lot
[2180.28 --> 2181.48]  It does it costs a ton
[2181.72 --> 2183.00]  Yeah, um, yeah
[2183.00 --> 2185.00]  Okay, great question from dave here
[2185.00 --> 2190.20]  Asus has kind of got their hands in everything at this point
[2190.20 --> 2194.44]  But if you were to pick something that they haven't done yet
[2195.24 --> 2196.68]  What would you like to see it be?
[2197.96 --> 2198.28]  Um
[2199.16 --> 2201.08]  I think okay, i'm gonna rephrase this
[2202.04 --> 2207.24]  What isn't being done right right now that you think asus could walk in and improve?
[2208.76 --> 2213.00]  You know, that's a tough part because I think in the areas that we haven't grown into
[2213.00 --> 2216.20]  I think that there is really good product like we get a lot of people that ask us
[2216.44 --> 2220.12]  Hey, how come you're not making you know coolers or power supplies?
[2220.68 --> 2222.36]  You know things like that and you know
[2222.36 --> 2227.32]  We work extensively with every top tier partner that's in the industry on this and we feel that they're making outstanding product
[2227.48 --> 2229.56]  And we actually provide a lot of feedback to them
[2229.88 --> 2232.28]  You know, we give them our insight and our analysis
[2232.76 --> 2235.80]  So in a lot of ways we're part of that development process already with them
[2235.80 --> 2238.20]  So we might not be the company that's putting it out there
[2238.36 --> 2242.36]  But have we had information that is pivotal at creating that product refined?
[2242.60 --> 2244.12]  Yeah, I mean when you're the number one
[2244.68 --> 2247.64]  Branded gpu manufacturer in the world number one board vendor in the world
[2247.72 --> 2250.76]  You carry a lot of weight when it comes to putting in feedback on a lot of points
[2251.08 --> 2251.56]  um, so
[2252.36 --> 2258.28]  You know for me personally to be honest i'd much rather see us continue to specialize on special product groups
[2258.52 --> 2262.04]  So once again, I can't go too much into it, but take for instance
[2263.16 --> 2264.68]  When you talk about a motherboard right?
[2264.68 --> 2268.28]  Why would a motherboard have to be based on an intel or an amd chipset?
[2268.28 --> 2270.60]  Why couldn't it maybe be based on an soc chipset?
[2271.08 --> 2274.04]  Why would it have to be targeted even running a windows operating system?
[2274.44 --> 2274.76]  Right?
[2274.76 --> 2280.92]  Um, you know or other examples might be or what about having a motherboard that's actually entirely independent of
[2281.48 --> 2282.28]  um
[2282.28 --> 2285.16]  An operating system, but works purely on a hardware input level
[2285.40 --> 2289.64]  So you could have it switch uh feedback and inputs from let's say audio and video sources
[2289.64 --> 2292.36]  But still have flexibility to have hardware level processing
[2292.36 --> 2296.68]  Uh that you could bring in from your cpu or from a gpu associated to those inputs
[2297.24 --> 2302.60]  um, so there's a lot of interesting things that our team is continuing to look at for the long term because we're passionate about
[2303.08 --> 2305.72]  The the do-it-yourself experience so I think
[2306.44 --> 2309.56]  While everybody thinks that uh, sometimes everything has already been done
[2309.80 --> 2313.32]  We definitely have the perspective that there's a lot more cool stuff that can be worked on
[2313.56 --> 2317.80]  And achieved even in the product groups that are out there right now at least that we're working in
[2317.80 --> 2322.52]  I already know. Oh, okay slick go ahead and then uh, i'll move on to the next question
[2322.52 --> 2326.28]  It's interesting because not all that long ago. I don't remember who it was
[2326.28 --> 2328.92]  Uh, I think it was for some reason i'm thinking ibm
[2328.92 --> 2333.16]  But a big guy in a big company said that there wasn't any innovation left or there wouldn't be soon
[2333.88 --> 2340.28]  And that people were just gonna have to improve on things that we already have and while it's still improving on things that we already have if you're making
[2341.24 --> 2347.00]  Massive fundamental changes to current product lines. I see that still as innovation. Absolutely. I mean, I
[2347.40 --> 2354.84]  Sometimes innovation can even be looking back at an older strategy and going well, maybe we weren't so wrong back then and bringing it back
[2355.00 --> 2361.16]  I mean, I think for the longest time the motherboard has gotten more and more tightly integrated
[2361.40 --> 2366.04]  whereas a manufacturer like asus that goes beyond the motherboard and
[2366.92 --> 2369.72]  Goes well. No, I mean we're making great onboard sound
[2369.72 --> 2373.56]  But we still think that someone needs his own our phoebus or in essence stx
[2373.56 --> 2378.44]  um, you know, you look at more specialized hardware like something like a red rocket
[2378.68 --> 2382.68]  Which is specifically designed for accelerating working with 4k?
[2383.16 --> 2385.16]  Um, well specifically red footage
[2385.88 --> 2393.40]  um, maybe maybe something like what you're saying where there's actually things that we can add to our pcs that are pcs some more like
[2393.48 --> 2398.44]  Supplementary processors so going back to like the coprocessor days. Yep and stuff like I think that's
[2398.44 --> 2401.88]  Sorry. Oh, no, no, no. I think you're on it
[2401.88 --> 2406.92]  And I think the only thing I was just going to touch with that is I think that we're in a very unique position
[2407.48 --> 2409.48]  to understand the opportunity to
[2409.88 --> 2413.80]  continue to grow really well because we're really the only component vendor that has our
[2414.20 --> 2418.12]  foot in so many spaces right where we have an awesome networking division
[2418.12 --> 2423.24]  We're making tablets we're making cell phones. We're making monitors. We're making motherboards. We're making sound cards
[2423.24 --> 2424.68]  We're in all these different spaces
[2424.68 --> 2429.72]  And so we have this real big kind of cross-contamination of all these technological kind of integration
[2429.72 --> 2430.76]  I'm quoting you on that
[2430.76 --> 2432.76]  Cross-contamination
[2433.40 --> 2434.28]  Well, that's what it is
[2434.28 --> 2438.12]  It contaminates, you know, it's the technology kind of gets in there and it festers and it makes you go
[2438.12 --> 2443.08]  Well, why can't you have you know this feature this function from this device into this other device?
[2443.08 --> 2445.24]  You know, I don't view it as being negative, you know
[2445.24 --> 2447.56]  I'd be it is like contaminate me some more, you know
[2450.20 --> 2452.20]  Oh, oh wow
[2453.64 --> 2454.68]  That's fantastic
[2456.60 --> 2459.80]  All right, let's see if I got maybe one more one more
[2461.88 --> 2464.12]  No, I don't think that one's that interesting
[2464.92 --> 2469.16]  Oh, well, what was that? What was that? Well, which one which one do you want? Which one do you want?
[2469.16 --> 2471.72]  Oh, no, I was just wondering which one was not that interesting
[2472.04 --> 2474.84]  Oh, well, okay here here. I'll let you tackle it if you want
[2474.84 --> 2476.60]  Um
[2476.68 --> 2482.44]  Someone asks with the msi gaming series boards rivaling rog on performance
[2482.68 --> 2487.32]  Because as you yourself said there's not much segmentation left anymore in terms of something like
[2487.88 --> 2490.84]  CPU frequency, so let's let's read it that way
[2491.56 --> 2495.96]  Will rog prices drop to more affordable levels?
[2496.92 --> 2503.24]  You know, that's a that's a really good question and I think that's our responsibility to help people realize why rog historically has
[2503.80 --> 2505.80]  Been on the premium in terms of pricing
[2506.44 --> 2509.16]  And I think if you look at the work that we've put into the product
[2509.16 --> 2513.64]  It's because that we've never banked on just being the feature set relative to overclocking
[2514.20 --> 2519.00]  You know, I've spent considerable time with you actually detailing this out where if you look at rog
[2519.00 --> 2522.28]  It's really been the four leader at a huge amount of our design innovation
[2522.52 --> 2525.72]  If you think about it kind of like a like an f1 formula concept
[2526.44 --> 2533.80]  The first digital power solutions for motherboards were implemented on rog or the first time that we integrated intel nix was on rog or our
[2534.44 --> 2540.76]  advanced fan expert technology having you know three pin and four pin control temperature target modifiable control
[2541.24 --> 2543.32]  That was all on rog series motherboards
[2543.88 --> 2548.84]  But when you try something new and it's entirely different guess what it costs you more time effort and money
[2549.16 --> 2551.88]  And that has to ultimately come into the cost of the product
[2552.20 --> 2559.48]  And I think rog users can I have realized that they've realized that they have gotten the best technology that we've been able to put out on the market at those times
[2559.88 --> 2563.08]  So that's one important thing, but I think even more importantly
[2563.08 --> 2568.12]  rog technologies have trickled into a huge amount of our main products
[2568.68 --> 2574.44]  By virtue while they're not an rg board right when you bought like a pro series motherboard or you bought a saber-tooth board
[2574.44 --> 2580.44]  Guess what you got fan expert 2 you got a digital power design you got the uefi features you got the fan expert 2
[2580.44 --> 2585.16]  You got the usb bios flashback technology, right all those things that start on rg board
[2585.16 --> 2590.20]  So by virtue, we're actually giving you rog technologies in our other boards that are at a lower cost
[2590.20 --> 2595.32]  And we're also always trying to look at how can we balance the pricing and that's for like this generation
[2595.32 --> 2601.88]  Why we came out with the hero board right that was targeted at being much more price aggressive than even our formula board in the past so um
[2602.76 --> 2605.96]  You know, I think that's one thing you you pay for what you get really and I think for us
[2605.96 --> 2611.40]  We've always been adamant that we're going to justify the price that you pay by putting in the work and effort to give you stuff
[2611.40 --> 2617.56]  That's really awesome. I mean the sound design alone right supreme effects even if you have a competitor like msi that copies
[2617.56 --> 2620.44]  Uh our sound design while it might not be the same
[2620.76 --> 2623.72]  We're going to still go that next generation say it's not just about supreme effects
[2623.72 --> 2628.76]  Let's add in sonic radar right in perfect voice because we want to give you that much more value
[2629.08 --> 2631.48]  So, you know, that's our job at the end of the day
[2631.48 --> 2634.84]  We have to keep pushing the envelope and we have to have a diverse product stack
[2635.40 --> 2638.92]  That's going to give you a huge amount of value for what you're paying so
[2639.40 --> 2640.12]  um
[2640.12 --> 2643.80]  You know at the end of the day competition is good for everybody it forces you to either be
[2643.80 --> 2650.12]  um innovative or you know, you end up losing out to a competitor and I think that we're going to continue to up our game
[2651.24 --> 2655.48]  Okay, I think that was I think that was a great answer answer. I'm going to add a couple of things so jamie
[2656.36 --> 2658.36]  to say to sort of directly
[2659.32 --> 2664.76]  Yes, you can get rog boards or technologies for cheaper. You can wait a generation
[2665.24 --> 2673.00]  In fact, I think the best way that jj explained how the vrm design on the latest generation rog boards is amazing
[2673.56 --> 2676.28]  But don't worry. The other ones are good was he said oh well
[2676.28 --> 2679.72]  They're using the same one as last gens rog and I was like, okay, that's probably fine then
[2681.08 --> 2686.36]  And then the other thing is will rog prices drop well, they are hero board as jj
[2686.76 --> 2693.80]  Already just said you know what you weren't able to get it at launch for lga 1150, but it's coming and formula already happened
[2693.80 --> 2697.88]  There never used to be a formula that came along after the extreme tier board
[2697.88 --> 2699.72]  So all these things are happening
[2699.72 --> 2705.64]  But basically there if you want to pay the premium for the r&d that made that board possible
[2705.64 --> 2709.64]  That will ultimately make those other boards later in further generations possible
[2710.04 --> 2712.04]  Then you got to pay
[2712.04 --> 2714.04]  I think that's fair
[2714.84 --> 2718.44]  I mean, I think it's like that way in a lot of technology, right? I mean, um, you know
[2718.44 --> 2721.40]  If you look at the companies that usually lead the industry in a lot of things
[2721.88 --> 2727.24]  Usually you don't get innovative product that tends to be lower in cost. It's just the nature of the beast, right?
[2727.48 --> 2729.16]  I mean, um things that are
[2729.72 --> 2733.16]  Really well designed or have really new functions or features tend to cost
[2733.48 --> 2735.64]  You know time and effort and development costs
[2735.64 --> 2742.20]  But you're 100% right in terms of we still at the end of they have to try to make a product that is reasonable in terms of the price points
[2742.52 --> 2748.36]  um, but you know, there's a there's also everybody's relative to what price they think is also high and low, right?
[2748.60 --> 2749.96]  You know, um, like when you guys were
[2750.52 --> 2754.76]  I monitor but he might think that 4k monitor is only accessible to them at $750
[2755.48 --> 2760.44]  But the small videographer, you know that is doing content creation might think man, you know what?
[2761.08 --> 2763.08]  $3,000 compared to
[2763.08 --> 2765.40]  $10,000 is a really good value for me
[2765.40 --> 2767.40]  Which it wasn't that long ago. Yeah
[2767.96 --> 2772.44]  So, you know a lot of this is also relative and that's why it's important to just have a diverse pulse
[2773.08 --> 2775.00]  Excuse me a diverse product stack, right?
[2775.88 --> 2780.12]  And that's actually great because the context that you're giving is very meaningful right there because
[2780.60 --> 2784.44]  To put this in perspective the $3,000 4k monitor
[2784.92 --> 2793.00]  Is actually not that big of a piece of the puzzle that would be involved in switching linus media group over to 4k production
[2793.00 --> 2795.00]  So we would need
[2795.00 --> 2800.04]  Anywhere from around 4 000 to around 10 000 worth of gear for our
[2800.60 --> 2801.72]  $8,000 camera
[2802.36 --> 2804.44]  In order to even shoot in 4k
[2804.68 --> 2810.60]  So by that point when we spend another three grand on a monitor to monitor in 4k and to work with 4k footage
[2810.60 --> 2811.56]  I mean
[2811.56 --> 2813.56]  That's not even including server infrastructure
[2813.56 --> 2818.04]  Infrastructure drives drives are gonna be huge because 4k footage is massive
[2818.28 --> 2818.52]  Yeah
[2819.08 --> 2821.56]  And we already fill up our massive server
[2821.80 --> 2823.96]  I know the nas is almost full
[2823.96 --> 2824.60]  I know
[2824.60 --> 2829.08]  I'm gonna have to like buy drives or better yet get on the phone with someone and tell them I need drives
[2829.08 --> 2834.68]  By nas he means like his 4u rack not really just like your little 4 bay nas
[2835.24 --> 2836.76]  It's huge and it's getting cool
[2836.76 --> 2840.44]  Here's a question jj this is totally unrelated to anything
[2841.00 --> 2848.36]  What's the sort of the weirdest thing that you run personally because I think slick's point about my nas is kind of like
[2848.36 --> 2851.24]  That's probably the weirdest thing I have where it's like this 4u
[2851.88 --> 2852.60]  um
[2852.60 --> 2858.12]  Norco so it's like a super cheap 4u case with 24 hot swap bays in the front
[2858.44 --> 2860.76]  I managed to get my hands on a 10 gigabit
[2861.32 --> 2861.64]  um
[2862.52 --> 2869.32]  Switch so it has and then I have like direct attach copper cables and like these weird esoteric cards that I got
[2869.32 --> 2870.44]  Oh, that's so sexy
[2871.56 --> 2876.20]  And it's running some like a reka card that's like a billion generations old
[2876.52 --> 2881.40]  But still super fast. It's like a 24 port card and it's like just the random is stupid the thing ever
[2881.40 --> 2884.52]  What do you have anything like that that really you geeked out over?
[2885.32 --> 2888.04]  Um, I don't know man every every system that I have
[2888.04 --> 2891.80]  I've got seven systems at home and they're all kind of like, you know, my kids right so
[2892.28 --> 2893.08]  um
[2893.08 --> 2896.28]  I don't know I guess the most specialized system I have is
[2897.00 --> 2901.64]  Probably for my blu-ray. I'm a really really big video guy and
[2902.36 --> 2907.64]  So I still buy all my stuff just because the quality on streaming or on-demand content is just too subpar for me
[2907.64 --> 2913.64]  It's just it's just too compressed too granulated and I want to see stuff as close as it is to the quality of what it was been produced at
[2913.96 --> 2914.44]  um, so
[2915.00 --> 2915.56]  um
[2915.56 --> 2917.80]  I it's kind of like a poor man's kaleidoscope system
[2917.80 --> 2919.32]  If you guys what kaleidoscope is
[2919.48 --> 2925.88]  It's this really high-end kind of professional blu-ray storage system that like george lucas and people that have a lot of money in afford
[2926.20 --> 2932.76]  Um, so i've got a similar setup where I rip them all and then digitally stream that out to my home entertainment system that I have set up
[2932.76 --> 2935.16]  So that's probably the most storage do you have in there?
[2935.80 --> 2941.24]  Um, I have right now eight terabytes of storage in that system very nice very nice
[2941.64 --> 2944.60]  What are you using to run that are you running on onboard raid or?
[2945.48 --> 2949.80]  Uh, no, um, yeah, I have that right now with an actual a rika
[2950.12 --> 2952.20]  um a professional controller card
[2953.64 --> 2958.84]  See that's not that different from my crazy thing and he was like, uh, he was like sort of, you know
[2958.84 --> 2962.68]  Seemed like he did weren't gonna have anything, but that's awesome. Love it
[2965.64 --> 2972.12]  All right, let me oh sorry. Yeah, I think I think it came through sorry. Yeah, that should be that's eight eight two terabytes
[2973.08 --> 2975.40]  ah, so 16 terabytes. Yes. Yep.
[2977.00 --> 2979.00]  That's more like it
[2980.68 --> 2986.84]  Oh, that's okay. That's an okay amount of storage. Yeah, that's okay. No, no now we're now we're talking that's about right
[2986.84 --> 2989.88]  What drives are you running? What do you think of the red drive?
[2991.08 --> 2994.68]  Uh, it's it's not a bad drive. I mean, I mean for its intended purpose
[2994.68 --> 2996.52]  It does what it's supposed to I mean
[2996.52 --> 3002.44]  It's very funny when you ask I guess a question like that because uh, the first thing that pops in my head is like ws motherboards
[3002.60 --> 3004.60]  There's so many users that right now run
[3005.16 --> 3009.00]  Products, but they run them in kind of pseudo ways for misintended purposes
[3009.32 --> 3009.72]  You know
[3009.72 --> 3014.12]  There's a lot of people that perceive that anything that they buy is designed for 24-hour operation
[3014.12 --> 3016.52]  And they don't realize that it's not there's a reason why
[3017.24 --> 3021.48]  Somebody like western digital produces a drive that says that it's rated for 24-hour operation
[3021.72 --> 3024.60]  Because it's designed to handle that type of workload or those type of temperatures
[3025.32 --> 3029.00]  So i'm always a fan to be honest of segment series product
[3029.00 --> 3030.84]  It doesn't mean that it's going to be everybody's cup of tea
[3030.84 --> 3034.68]  But that's okay because it was designed for a specific usage in specific models
[3034.68 --> 3039.32]  So that just once again comes down to I think like the topic that we talked about at the very beginning of the show
[3039.32 --> 3042.20]  You know picking the right parts for what it is that you're actually doing
[3042.20 --> 3046.12]  You know if you're not going to be running a type of configuration that needs that you don't need it
[3048.28 --> 3053.32]  All right, so there are a few new products coming that you wanted to talk about on the show
[3053.32 --> 3057.08]  Why don't we transition into that before we do a little bit more uh q a?
[3058.68 --> 3062.52]  Yeah, sure uh, whatever I mean, uh for me, it's you know, I think a lot of people have heard about these
[3062.52 --> 3066.28]  I'm actually i'm more interested in answering um the questions of people, you know
[3066.28 --> 3068.52]  I think they can always find out about those products
[3068.52 --> 3073.08]  So what I would probably say is if you just want to note on a couple of them and if anybody's got questions about them
[3073.08 --> 3074.92]  I'd be more than happy to answer them
[3074.92 --> 3079.80]  All right. Well, there was someone asking about mini itx. So I think we have to talk about the impact
[3080.44 --> 3083.40]  Sure, so I know when you came out to the z87
[3084.44 --> 3088.84]  Technical summit that we have that was one of the boards that we worked on because we had a huge amount of people
[3089.40 --> 3093.40]  Always asking us about when are you guys going to make an ROG mini itx board?
[3093.40 --> 3097.80]  Um, and so i'm very very happy to say that in probably about a week and a half
[3098.52 --> 3100.36]  we're going to be releasing uh the
[3100.84 --> 3106.68]  Maximus 6 impact board and uh probably within next week we'll be releasing the z87 dash i
[3107.32 --> 3112.44]  Deluxe so that's the mainstream version so one I call the red beast and the other one I called the golden beast
[3113.00 --> 3115.72]  Because of the corresponding colors, but they're awesome boards
[3115.72 --> 3121.96]  I mean if you're looking for pretty much just the most kind of balls to the wall mini itx board that's got everything on it
[3121.96 --> 3124.12]  Um, those two boards are going to do it
[3124.68 --> 3130.68]  That's exactly what i've been waiting for actually is that like little extended pcb thing because my brother won a prodigy
[3131.24 --> 3136.28]  Uh when at the landcouver after party thing. Yeah, he's been wondering what to do and i'm just been like hold up
[3136.28 --> 3138.28]  Just just wait
[3139.96 --> 3142.28]  Yeah, that's actually what i've been spending time on uh
[3142.28 --> 3146.52]  If you guys if anybody here follows our asus uh, like instagram or like facebook
[3146.52 --> 3151.56]  They they went into my cubicle and they took a picture of the seven headphones that I have right now at my desk
[3151.80 --> 3156.36]  Where i've been testing out uh, the supreme effects isolated audio design for the little impact board
[3156.76 --> 3160.68]  Um, so yeah, it's it's awesome because I mean it's really no compromise, right?
[3160.68 --> 3162.44]  You get the awesome audio on board
[3162.60 --> 3165.40]  You still get the expansion capabilities for throwing in the gpu
[3165.80 --> 3171.96]  You get the 8-11 ac you got the bluetooth it even supports the new small form factor m.2 flash ssds
[3172.52 --> 3179.32]  Um, you know, I mean this is why i've never gone mini itx because I need two pci express slots period damn it
[3179.56 --> 3183.00]  I need a video card and I need a sound card. I can live without a raid card
[3183.00 --> 3186.20]  I can live without a 10 gigabit nick or whatever other stuff
[3186.76 --> 3190.60]  Cannot live without those two things and this is the solution
[3191.72 --> 3192.68]  Yeah, no, I yeah
[3192.68 --> 3199.08]  I mean, I think the thing is that we've worked really really hard on trying to make a board that we felt was unquestionably a board that you felt
[3199.08 --> 3201.64]  You weren't going to compromise on right? Yes
[3201.64 --> 3203.96]  You were gonna maybe lose out on a couple of slots
[3204.28 --> 3208.04]  But in relation to the rest of the expansion the feature set it's all there
[3208.04 --> 3211.88]  I mean each board has got four fan headers that are all uniquely controllable
[3211.88 --> 3214.84]  I mean, that's crazy that on a little mini itx board you've got four fan headers
[3215.48 --> 3219.16]  That are fully controllable three pin four pin you can manually set fan curves
[3219.40 --> 3221.72]  So even if you throw it in something like you said like a prodigy
[3221.96 --> 3225.64]  Um, you know, you could stuff it and be able to control everything on there
[3225.64 --> 3229.96]  So i'm really juiced about those boards i'm right now doing actually the overclocking test on them
[3230.60 --> 3234.52]  And everything's going through smooth, so I hope I hope users are going to be really excited about them
[3234.52 --> 3235.96]  We've worked really hard on them
[3235.96 --> 3241.24]  All right, i've got an excellent ask jj question over here because this is something i've been curious about myself
[3241.72 --> 3247.96]  Yeah, what is the possibility of an rog motherboard that's dual socketed like the srx or sr2?
[3248.04 --> 3251.88]  How do you see those pro how do you how do those products fit into the market?
[3251.88 --> 3256.68]  That's a really good question. Um, you know, we've been doing dual socketed boards for a long time
[3256.68 --> 3263.56]  But in our ws series, um, and we haven't really done it on the rog line because with rog there's an expectation
[3264.12 --> 3266.12]  of performance and functionality
[3266.36 --> 3267.24]  um
[3267.24 --> 3272.44]  You know to be honest, I don't really like commenting on competitors more so because I feel that a product should speak for itself
[3272.44 --> 3279.96]  Not the marketer. Let's comment on the um, but no, I'm gonna need for performance dual socket boards for gamers
[3279.96 --> 3285.56]  But no, I want to make a point on why we haven't done something like specifically the srx and the evga
[3285.88 --> 3286.92]  um
[3286.92 --> 3290.68]  rog boards we take a huge amount of effort on the resources in the long term
[3291.00 --> 3294.20]  So if you consider something like let's say like the rampage for extreme right now
[3294.20 --> 3297.64]  It's got 20 uefi updates that have come out since that sports launch
[3297.80 --> 3303.24]  That's a huge amount of long-term support to make sure that the board is smooth responsive works the way it's supposed to
[3303.56 --> 3307.96]  Um, the srx don't take my word for it. Look at the community look at the responses
[3307.96 --> 3312.28]  They will tell you that that board has had a lot of inconsistency issues on how it's worked
[3312.52 --> 3317.24]  In terms of things like the option rom support putting in just expansion cards and things along those lines
[3317.64 --> 3323.80]  We wouldn't release a board like the srx unless we felt confident that it could work the way that a normal user wants to make it work
[3324.04 --> 3327.40]  So drop in any card into it have it work and have it be functional
[3327.72 --> 3333.32]  The main thing though is that it since it's not an overclockable platform and so many people associate rog with overclocking
[3333.64 --> 3334.44]  um
[3334.44 --> 3338.12]  That's kind of the limiting factor since zeons are locked architectural parts
[3338.52 --> 3343.32]  We'd rather say we're going to put out something like our z9 pe which is a beast of a board that we have right now
[3343.80 --> 3351.08]  So if you want something that works stable solid it's got tons of memory 14 sata ports and dual cpu support it's there
[3351.08 --> 3353.08]  It just won't be under the rog line
[3353.64 --> 3357.24]  So here's a question for you if you could have your way
[3357.24 --> 3360.04]  Would you put would you pressure intel?
[3361.16 --> 3369.32]  In any way or would you does it bother you as an enthusiast that intel doesn't enable dual socket operation on the extreme edition there?
[3370.12 --> 3374.76]  Because that's something that bothers me personally. I believe an extreme edition should be an unfettered chip
[3376.76 --> 3381.64]  You know, that's that's actually a pretty good question. Um, I think we would I think we would like to see that
[3381.64 --> 3387.88]  Um, I wouldn't mind seeing um a cpu that would support that there are a couple of other variables
[3388.76 --> 3394.28]  That kind of play into that in terms of the lithography even though technically the zeon parts are very very very close
[3394.52 --> 3397.08]  To the overall architectural design of a standard
[3397.80 --> 3401.56]  Consumer grade part. There's still a couple of things to weave in there, but sure
[3402.20 --> 3404.36]  I would like to see that I think it'd be pretty awesome
[3404.36 --> 3408.84]  Uh, you know, I mean you'd have to consider of course what'd be the sell-through, but you know, it's crazy
[3408.84 --> 3415.88]  One of our partners actually in canada cr tech who does a high-end system workstations for companies like ferrari like porsche and things like that
[3416.20 --> 3422.68]  They actually buy like our rog boards water cool overclock them and use them as actually um rendering systems
[3422.92 --> 3424.68]  So they'll like go
[3424.68 --> 3430.44]  Crazy they'll be configuring like five gigahertz overclock systems because if you think about it, you know
[3430.44 --> 3435.80]  If they can cut down their render times by you know, uh 20 percent right and they can offer hours
[3436.20 --> 3441.00]  Yeah, they can they can offer a competitive bid versus another company. That's a big value to them
[3441.32 --> 3447.32]  Um, so I could look at the opportunity of saying wow could I take something like a dual core zeon system
[3447.32 --> 3453.56]  Which is already eight cores 16 threads 20 megs of cash and then add another 30 percent by overclocking it
[3453.56 --> 3458.84]  That's just an insane beast of a system, right? Um, so sure would the enthusiasts me love to see it
[3458.84 --> 3462.92]  Yeah, but uh, you know, I don't know that it's necessarily gonna happen
[3462.92 --> 3466.12]  I don't know that it's gonna happen either. I just to me
[3466.12 --> 3472.76]  It's so disappointing because it feels like extreme edition has become um, just a a case badge
[3473.32 --> 3480.84]  Uh, you look at something like the difference between 39 60x and 39 30k and they go. Oh, well, you know, there's three megs of cash and um
[3482.60 --> 3487.80]  Yeah, to add a bit my dad is planning on doing that insane build that i've talked to you about a bit, but not the stream
[3487.80 --> 3491.00]  Um, it's gonna be nuts. I'm not gonna go way too far into it though
[3491.40 --> 3496.28]  But as a person who's really into computers, but hasn't had a lot of time to look into them recently my dad
[3497.16 --> 3500.84]  He was looking at the motherboards that we were looking through and going okay
[3500.84 --> 3504.60]  So this is all workstation stuff because i'm planning a 2011 platform for him and he goes
[3505.08 --> 3509.48]  Why did I just want two cpus like can I just get two cpus and I was like
[3511.00 --> 3513.24]  Because I think the true enthusiasts out there
[3514.20 --> 3518.20]  Might not be willing to spend a thousand dollars on an extreme edition
[3518.84 --> 3523.48]  Versus a 39 30k or 49 30 care whatever generation it happens to be
[3523.72 --> 3529.16]  But I think that those hardcore enthusiasts would spend two grand if it meant they could put two of them in
[3529.40 --> 3534.20]  Yep, because he's gonna be running stuff like boink and really heavy applications that are running all the time
[3534.44 --> 3537.32]  If he can run two cpus water cool them
[3537.32 --> 3541.64]  So they don't get too hot and just power through everything that's exactly what he wants
[3543.96 --> 3548.20]  So that makes me sad and still make it very gamer friendly and all that other kind of stuff
[3549.24 --> 3554.76]  You know, there's one one point that I guess I would just make to that is that um, there's always somebody that has a need
[3555.00 --> 3561.72]  Even it exists. Um, and the only reason why I say that is because it's it's just like the gpu wars right where you'll get somebody
[3561.72 --> 3569.64]  It says nobody needs a titan nobody needs a 780 my 570 runs every game at 1080p at maximum settings
[3569.96 --> 3572.76]  You sound like the ultimate keyboard warrior right now. I love it
[3573.40 --> 3578.84]  And that's that's fine every everybody has their usage model that works entirely okay for them
[3578.92 --> 3581.88]  And that's okay if you don't think you need to upgrade you don't need to upgrade
[3582.52 --> 3584.92]  But it's all relative to your system, right?
[3585.00 --> 3586.68]  I mean what if you're you know
[3586.68 --> 3594.28]  If you're that user that does have three monitors and you play in 3d vision well guess what you need multiple gpus and you need high-end multiple gpus
[3594.76 --> 3595.00]  Yeah
[3595.00 --> 3601.00]  So it really just comes down to what do you do on your system is going to define the part that you need and uh, you know
[3601.32 --> 3603.32]  That that's what it comes out here
[3603.32 --> 3608.12]  So radar express pci e ssd. This is something that you wanted to talk about there. It is
[3608.60 --> 3615.40]  Um, why is it only pci ev2 is a question that I think you can probably handle pretty easily for that one
[3615.40 --> 3618.68]  But then I just want you to talk about it in general. What makes this product special?
[3619.24 --> 3624.76]  Yeah, um, actually radar express has been a pretty cool product. We've worked a really long time on it. You got to see it of course at
[3625.40 --> 3626.28]  CES
[3626.28 --> 3630.28]  um, I guess to answer the question quickly, it's a it's a pci express
[3630.92 --> 3637.24]  Interconnect by 2 predominantly because of the cost if we were to go to a higher end interconnect, it's just going to increase the cost considerably
[3637.32 --> 3638.68]  It's more expensive
[3638.68 --> 3639.80]  Um, so we didn't all right
[3639.80 --> 3644.12]  We didn't want to release a product that would have been that much more expensive and have people just be like
[3644.12 --> 3645.48]  There's no way that i'm going to buy that
[3645.48 --> 3649.48]  Um, so that's that one in terms of the coolness of it though
[3649.48 --> 3650.76]  I think it's a really flexible part
[3650.76 --> 3654.84]  I mean, there's still a lot of people out there that are on chips. It's like x48 or p45
[3655.48 --> 3658.20]  p, you know 35, you know, even um
[3659.16 --> 3662.92]  Even the guys that are holding over like on 920s and x58 where you don't have native
[3663.24 --> 3664.20]  um
[3664.20 --> 3665.72]  sata 6g support, right?
[3665.72 --> 3670.68]  So something like a radio express is a perfect way of being able to drop something and get really high speed performance
[3670.68 --> 3674.60]  Um, it's simple that's plug and play, but there's a lot of really cool supplemental software
[3674.60 --> 3676.68]  Like it comes included with ram disk software
[3676.68 --> 3679.80]  So you can go ahead and set up that and that can also help to offset
[3680.44 --> 3683.96]  The rights to the ssd so it can extend the lifespan of it
[3684.36 --> 3686.36]  You get ssd caching support
[3686.36 --> 3691.08]  That's also included with that so that if you need to be able to have high capacity, but improve performance
[3691.08 --> 3693.08]  You also have that functionality
[3693.16 --> 3696.36]  And there's some really cool supplemental software that's also tied into it
[3696.36 --> 3699.08]  So it's going to be coming out probably in about I think um
[3699.64 --> 3703.48]  Maybe about like a week or two weeks or so, but it's a it's a pretty awesome little drive
[3703.88 --> 3709.64]  You know, but is it going to be for everybody? No, I mean if you're probably like on z87 right now and running to you, you know, high performance
[3710.36 --> 3713.32]  ssds like, you know, a neutron gtx is or something like that
[3713.64 --> 3715.96]  Um, you know, that's probably a great fit for you already
[3715.96 --> 3720.28]  So you're not necessarily going to be the person that would be targeting a radar express
[3721.48 --> 3723.48]  Okay, I think that covers it pretty well
[3723.48 --> 3729.08]  This is a question that has kind of a sad answer I suspect but i've seen quite a few people ask it
[3729.08 --> 3731.08]  I don't have the particular tweet up right now
[3732.12 --> 3737.08]  Um, why not more amd motherboards and I think we all sort of know what's coming?
[3738.52 --> 3742.84]  Wow, that's a question because I mean we're the biggest amd board partner in the world
[3742.84 --> 3745.96]  So we make a whole lot of them. I mean right there on my list, right?
[3745.96 --> 3749.96]  I said that i'm testing the next fm2 plus motherboards already that we're developing
[3749.96 --> 3754.12]  Um, we're working on some really cool boards for cabini and kaviri
[3754.52 --> 3759.64]  Um, you know, and at the end of the day it just comes down to market share. Do we have more intel boards?
[3760.12 --> 3763.80]  Um than amd motherboards? Yes, uh, and that just comes down to that
[3763.80 --> 3769.56]  There are more consumers that are purchasing intel platforms than there are amd platforms, but are we committed to amd? 100%
[3770.04 --> 3776.12]  Um, you know, we make crosshair we make our rg line for uh for amd. We make our saber tooth line for amd
[3776.52 --> 3781.64]  We've got micro atx we're going to be doing even thin mini itx for amd some really cool stuff there
[3782.28 --> 3787.48]  So that's exciting. I can definitely tell you man. Do not worry about uh our focus on amd
[3787.48 --> 3790.92]  We're 100 committed to continue to work with them and to be honest
[3790.92 --> 3795.24]  I actually I think that apus are really starting to hit their stride and um
[3795.24 --> 3798.84]  While I can't go into the some of the next generation stuff because of course it's under nda
[3799.16 --> 3805.32]  I'm very impressed with where the architecture is now starting to move itself in terms of the functionality and the capabilities
[3805.32 --> 3807.32]  And I think it's going to get that much cooler
[3808.60 --> 3813.08]  All right, i've got a question from wind speed. I think wow, we've been at this about an hour
[3813.08 --> 3816.04]  So maybe we'll make this the uh, the second last question
[3816.84 --> 3823.96]  Why are the new z87 boards gold? Why not black silver or white or almost any color other than gold?
[3823.96 --> 3828.12]  Because from the feedback i've seen it's very mixed. Um
[3828.68 --> 3832.12]  Very polarizing that gold color. Yeah, um
[3832.12 --> 3838.20]  That's a it's a good question. Uh long story short. I mean it just came down to a decision, you know, um
[3838.20 --> 3841.88]  Some people might think that this is, uh, you know a very marketing oriented answer
[3841.88 --> 3847.56]  But I firmly believe and i'm passionate about the fact that I think that we make better better motherboards than anybody else
[3848.12 --> 3853.08]  And um, our rnd and our pm and our marketing team all felt that same way
[3853.72 --> 3855.96]  So when the decision came to new color scheme, we said
[3856.60 --> 3861.08]  Let's go ahead and just do it. Let's set the tone as being where the gold standard and motherboards
[3861.08 --> 3864.44]  And we did that from an aesthetic perspective. So
[3865.16 --> 3867.48]  That's the reason why that we went ahead and selected gold
[3867.48 --> 3870.68]  We felt why not represent ourselves as what we think is the best out there
[3871.08 --> 3875.08]  And to a lot of people said that they don't think it goes with stuff. Um, I disagree
[3875.72 --> 3877.88]  A natural complement to gold is black
[3878.28 --> 3880.20]  And I think when you came out to the technical summit
[3880.20 --> 3885.40]  I think that the initial look of it sometimes can be a little bit stark because you look so different than something else
[3885.40 --> 3889.64]  But once you put inside of a chassis and you realize that it complements anything that goes black with it
[3889.96 --> 3895.48]  It actually works quite well. Um, I don't know if you've gotten the chance to check out. Um, I don't know
[3895.48 --> 3897.48]  Did you go to lancouver?
[3897.48 --> 3902.60]  I did go to lancouver. So, uh, I did you get to check it check out, uh, the murder box project that we worked on
[3902.60 --> 3905.64]  I did check out charles is, uh, here. I'm gonna actually
[3906.92 --> 3908.28]  And
[3908.28 --> 3916.12]  I think that for me unquestionably sets the tone to say if you don't think that black and gold can look good or you don't think a gold motherboard can look good
[3917.40 --> 3920.92]  Then I don't know what to tell you because I think that that is one of the most quintessentially
[3921.56 --> 3924.20]  amazing looking systems that i've ever seen and
[3924.20 --> 3931.24]  Myself, I've tried out tons of different chassis, you know, uh, corsair carbide bit phoenix ghost some ndxt chassis
[3931.56 --> 3936.76]  I've done a lot of different configurations and I think it's actually really easy to find a mix that works really well with the gold look
[3937.64 --> 3941.32]  Okay, I'm gonna pull up a video. Oh, uh, here. Send me that links like
[3942.28 --> 3946.12]  I'm just gonna pull this up so that the viewers can uh can check it out and have a look
[3946.60 --> 3953.32]  It's just gonna be in the bottom of the dock. Oh bottom of the dock. Okay, so here's the one that uh, JJ was talking about here you guys
[3954.20 --> 3959.64]  Go ahead and flip that over there. There it is. I saw this in person charles is
[3960.28 --> 3964.04]  some kind of wizard because that's what it takes to
[3964.84 --> 3967.24]  build something like this absolutely gorgeous
[3970.12 --> 3972.04]  And there's an asus motherboard look at that
[3975.08 --> 3983.40]  I saw that in person and it was actually kind of awesome because I haven't seen a ton of um properly themed out builds coming with the golden motherboard
[3983.88 --> 3989.40]  But seeing that at landcouver was very cool and I liked how he tied in the sleeving with it as well. It was really nice
[3991.00 --> 3993.72]  Okay, so let's go ahead on and uh
[3994.60 --> 3997.72]  You know what? Why don't we find let's okay. Let's not do a q&a thing here
[3997.88 --> 4003.00]  Let's just find a regular topic and let's have JJ kind of join us for it. Ah, yes
[4003.64 --> 4005.64]  amd releases
[4005.80 --> 4009.48]  13.8 beta driver, so i'm gonna intro the topic really quick here
[4009.48 --> 4015.80]  So a joy 39 from the forum posts the link to the pc per article which is excellent
[4015.80 --> 4021.08]  By the way you guys you should definitely read it ryan shroud does a fantastic job of explaining
[4021.56 --> 4025.40]  Frame rating and frame latency and all of these things
[4025.96 --> 4032.04]  It's definitely worth the read in fact ryan will be joining us as a guest sometime in the next few weeks here
[4032.04 --> 4039.88]  Along with marcus brownlee we're gonna have tiny tom logan joining us and i'm sure i'm forgetting something really important right now
[4040.44 --> 4041.56]  Oh boy
[4041.56 --> 4043.08]  Crap who is it? Okay?
[4043.08 --> 4046.04]  Well, there's someone else who's going to be joining us soon as well so
[4046.84 --> 4050.20]  There you go amd has released the driver update
[4050.20 --> 4057.40]  That promised to address particularly in dual gpu configurations issues where certain frames
[4057.96 --> 4063.08]  Would take a very long time to display which caused visible
[4064.68 --> 4067.88]  visible i'm sorry sorry i was somebody said i was
[4068.76 --> 4072.60]  Eating a chicken gyro and something else i'm sorry please continue anyway
[4074.12 --> 4076.12]  Are you eating a chicken gyro right now?
[4076.12 --> 4080.92]  No, no i wouldn't mind a chicken gyro why aren't you eating a chicken gyro right now?
[4081.80 --> 4085.64]  Yeah, you don't even have to be on a video feed like us you could be eating whatever you want
[4086.12 --> 4092.28]  Yeah, dude, i want to give my unfettered attention to you and your viewers man because you guys rock so
[4092.84 --> 4094.68]  All right, so anyway amd
[4095.40 --> 4102.20]  Is looking to address the stuttering or hitching that you'd sometimes observe particularly in crossfire configurations as well
[4102.20 --> 4106.52]  As i don't know if you guys have ever noticed this but when you pan the camera really quickly in game
[4107.00 --> 4111.48]  Sometimes you'll see and it's not always caused by lack of vsync
[4111.80 --> 4118.60]  But tearing that just looks absolutely disgusting where the top of the image doesn't quite match up with the bottom of the image
[4118.60 --> 4122.68]  And then which doesn't match up kind of over here and it looks really ugly so
[4123.64 --> 4125.80]  The new drivers here jj i'm sure you've
[4125.80 --> 4130.28]  I'm sure you've been reading up on this and following it pretty closely. What's your take?
[4130.28 --> 4136.76]  We've been working extensively with amd on this for almost the last six months as a as a partner with them, so
[4137.40 --> 4143.56]  I'm very happy to finally see this driver actually come out i've been working on the alpha versions of it for way too long
[4143.96 --> 4147.08]  So I can definitely tell you if you are a crossfire user
[4147.64 --> 4153.48]  Go to amd.com download it yesterday and get it installed on your system because you're not going to regret it
[4153.48 --> 4159.32]  So that's what it comes down to if you just you're a gamer you're on amd you're in crossfire get these drivers enough said
[4160.12 --> 4167.08]  Now oh, sorry go ahead. That's really exciting because it's it's been a long time where if anyone ever asks about dual cards
[4167.64 --> 4171.96]  Especially if they're talking about amd everyone just boom no don't do it buy a higher card
[4172.12 --> 4175.72]  Which might still be a talking point and might still be the answer but at least there's
[4176.60 --> 4181.08]  A saving grace for the people that already have them and somewhat of a reason for people that want to buy new ones
[4181.08 --> 4185.32]  So tell me jj for you personally and I know this might be a bit of an awkward question
[4185.32 --> 4190.76]  But if you were going to grab two graphics cards for a gaming rig that you wanted to play
[4190.92 --> 4195.88]  Let's say single monitor, but high resolution games on which route do you go?
[4196.68 --> 4198.12]  Right now?
[4198.12 --> 4204.68]  Oh, sorry. Hold on. I have to respond to e-judge 97 jj cannot possibly be involved in as much as he claims to be
[4205.96 --> 4207.56]  I know he doesn't sleep
[4207.56 --> 4209.40]  So there you go. I think that answers it
[4209.40 --> 4216.52]  I think linus knows uh how much of my waking day I spend on this stuff and that's a lot of it but anyways um
[4217.32 --> 4220.12]  I'm sorry to clarify your question. Was it was what was it again?
[4220.68 --> 4224.12]  If you had bearing in mind that this beta drivers here now
[4224.68 --> 4232.20]  Where nvidia has a hardware solution that they've had implemented for a couple generations now if you were to go dual graphics
[4232.20 --> 4240.52]  Do you go for the hardware implementation or are you willing to look at amd and nvidia as on completely equal footing at this point?
[4240.52 --> 4245.48]  Oh, okay. Okay. I got you. Um, well in my analysis, um, you know in the time that i've been spending
[4245.48 --> 4251.80]  I mean nvidia definitely has done a fantastic job with what's called their frame metering technology which they have built on a hardware level
[4252.28 --> 4260.04]  Um and but the work that amd has done with this frame pacing design has actually put them on very very good footing in terms of the frame latency
[4260.04 --> 4263.32]  Not only at the initial output of the display driver
[4263.64 --> 4267.32]  Which is what something like a fraps would capture versus the f cap system
[4267.32 --> 4270.84]  Which is going to capture it at the display output and on what you see on the screen?
[4271.16 --> 4274.04]  So when we comparatively look at what's what really matters
[4274.04 --> 4277.00]  Which is the results as you as a gamer and the experience that you have?
[4277.40 --> 4281.24]  Um as long as the game has been passion is correctly supported
[4282.44 --> 4285.24]  Then you're going to get a fairly parity experience now
[4285.32 --> 4286.60]  I think that uh
[4286.60 --> 4293.08]  AMD needs to continue to work on this to improve upon this and we're definitely committed to working with our community of users and them to
[4293.16 --> 4294.36]  to keep pushing on this
[4294.36 --> 4298.76]  Nvidia I think has a little bit of an edge right now just because they've been spending more time to optimize
[4299.24 --> 4302.12]  The driver set for better multi gpu configuration
[4303.16 --> 4309.00]  So especially like I was testing out our 4k monitor that unquestionably was it was a smoother overall experience
[4309.56 --> 4311.56]  With multiple nvidia based gpus
[4311.56 --> 4317.96]  That's a very good point because guys the new beta driver from amd does not address
[4318.52 --> 4320.52]  multi-display configurations
[4321.40 --> 4328.52]  And pc purr actually also found that it didn't improve things much with gpu configurations beyond two-way crossfire
[4329.00 --> 4332.36]  So asus's 4k display actually relies
[4332.92 --> 4339.32]  on sort of affinity technology in order to achieve 4k 60 hertz by having
[4339.32 --> 4343.32]  uh two virtual tiled displays that make up
[4343.96 --> 4348.84]  One single 4k display now obviously there's no seam between them anymore because there's no bezel
[4349.40 --> 4351.24]  But if you were a 4k gamer
[4352.04 --> 4354.20]  Probably you're going to go nvidia at this point
[4355.00 --> 4359.72]  Yeah, definitely uh, the nvidia experience is very it's it's actually it's quite good
[4359.72 --> 4363.00]  I mean, I I was doing even gtx 760s
[4363.56 --> 4368.36]  On 4k I mean it depends on the game that you're playing a course in terms of the iq settings
[4368.76 --> 4373.96]  But even that configuration was actually smooth and it was responsive for the different titles that I was trying out
[4374.12 --> 4377.80]  So they've got a little bit of an edge there, but everybody's got work to do even um
[4378.60 --> 4382.92]  st micro who's an actual firmware company has to help to patch some things because right now
[4384.04 --> 4386.12]  Nvidia doesn't have certain hardware implemented
[4386.60 --> 4390.84]  uh well not hardware but the the design of the car doesn't allow for certain output sequencing
[4390.84 --> 4395.32]  Uh for the initialization of let's say a post a screen on like a 4k panel
[4395.32 --> 4399.32]  So it's weird you'll you'll turn on your system and when it actually goes into the display
[4400.04 --> 4405.32]  You won't actually see an image. It'll just go straight into windows. So there's there's you know
[4405.32 --> 4408.36]  There's things that like you said when you're on the cutting edge. It's not really the cutting edge
[4408.36 --> 4413.24]  It's the bleeding edge and when you're on the bleeding edge, uh, you're going to bleed a little bit and you know
[4413.24 --> 4414.36]  That's the nature of the beast
[4414.36 --> 4417.32]  Um, but you know when you get the rewards it's awesome, right?
[4417.80 --> 4423.24]  Yeah, people often tell me that they're they're jealous of sort of the opportunity that I have to work with
[4423.56 --> 4429.32]  The latest hardware that's not even out and what I usually say is that it's totally not worth it
[4430.04 --> 4436.60]  To work with hardware that's not out unless it's like your job because there's no such thing as googling an issue
[4436.60 --> 4437.08]  No
[4437.08 --> 4440.84]  Because it's not no one else has one yet. So
[4444.44 --> 4450.12]  Um, okay sam's okay last topic. Thank you for joining us for so long jj. You've been awesome
[4451.16 --> 4454.04]  I love it. No problem. I'm gonna bring you in for one more
[4454.68 --> 4461.56]  samsung denies phone test trick so this is an article from the bbc submitted by etrj
[4461.56 --> 4463.56]  All right
[4464.76 --> 4467.40]  This is uh, this is this is kind of awesome. I mean as us
[4467.96 --> 4471.16]  PC guys that have been doing this kind of forever
[4471.88 --> 4474.52]  This this whole scandal is just like
[4477.24 --> 4482.36]  It's been done. Yeah, how how done has this been but samsung has denied claims that it
[4482.36 --> 4488.60]  deliberately designed its galaxy s4 chip to perform better in tests used by reviewers than in real life situations
[4488.60 --> 4492.92]  So jj have you heard much about this so far? I've heard just a very small amount
[4493.40 --> 4498.92]  Okay, so i'm gonna i'll tell talk to the viewers about it as well as to you and you can give me your take on all this
[4499.48 --> 4500.52]  so
[4500.52 --> 4502.52]  samsung is saying that
[4502.52 --> 4503.88]  on their
[4503.88 --> 4508.04]  On their on their octa core chip that it is due to
[4510.52 --> 4512.76]  What are what oh crap what are they calling it
[4512.76 --> 4522.68]  Anyway the point is that what they're doing is in order to prevent users experiencing a fault
[4522.92 --> 4529.08]  They are throttling the gpu frequency below what is their claimed gpu frequency that it runs at
[4529.40 --> 4533.64]  Then what's happening is in certain applications for example
[4534.44 --> 4534.92]  uh
[4535.48 --> 4542.12]  You know mobile gpu benchmarking software it is actually running at a higher frequency than it does
[4542.12 --> 4542.92]  It does
[4542.92 --> 4544.92]  In actual games
[4544.92 --> 4552.60]  So what they say is under ordinary conditions the galaxy s4 has been designed to allow maximum gpu frequency of 533 megahertz
[4552.60 --> 4553.08]  However
[4553.72 --> 4560.68]  The maximum gpu frequency is lowered to 480 megahertz for certain gaming apps that may cause an overload
[4561.00 --> 4564.84]  When they are used for a prolonged period of time in full screen mode
[4565.40 --> 4567.00]  to which i kind of
[4567.00 --> 4572.44]  say well bollocks to that because i've never heard of any benchmark that isn't designed
[4572.76 --> 4576.20]  to push the system as hard if not harder than an actual game
[4580.60 --> 4582.52]  So if you bought this phone how do you feel
[4584.28 --> 4585.80]  You know that's a good question i think
[4585.80 --> 4591.00]  it is a lot of complex aspects in there while you're might be correct in terms that sometimes benchmarks
[4591.00 --> 4593.00]  have higher load dependencies
[4594.04 --> 4597.48]  games have different algorithmic structures and and how they have
[4598.68 --> 4600.44]  loading policies associated with them
[4601.00 --> 4605.40]  Because of that it can be very tricky to try to figure out how you could code policies
[4605.40 --> 4610.20]  We actually as a motherboard vendor have to face the same thing a lot of users don't realize that
[4611.40 --> 4613.00]  Something like let's say the c states
[4613.88 --> 4615.80]  Affect the way that the cpu actually will
[4616.36 --> 4622.20]  Will have its turbo respond so the turbo performance can actually be held longer or lower
[4622.76 --> 4627.40]  And that can actually vary the actual performance it can even impact things like your hard drive performance
[4627.40 --> 4632.28]  And that's all up to the motherboard vendor to tune in what type of c state parameters they want
[4632.28 --> 4637.56]  And for how long they want to hold them and for under what conditions they want to hold them and even actually
[4637.56 --> 4642.20]  What applications they sometimes might want to be able to do it and this is actually going to even get more interesting
[4642.20 --> 4644.28]  I can't go into too much, but there's going to be some two
[4644.84 --> 4646.76]  Architektual changes from intel
[4647.40 --> 4651.40]  That will allow for some very interesting things relative to per core tuning
[4652.12 --> 4654.04]  That will continue to kind of allow for
[4654.36 --> 4657.24]  optimizations relative to applications and how they're running
[4657.96 --> 4660.12]  You know at the end of the day. I think this just comes down to
[4660.92 --> 4663.08]  You know as long as they're not breaking
[4663.64 --> 4669.80]  um information that they're detailing to the consumer saying hey i'm giving you x result and the consumer is actually getting a different result
[4669.80 --> 4676.44]  I think it's entirely up to them to um to define and design the product how they feel it's going to provide the best performance
[4676.76 --> 4681.40]  As long as they're not breaking a promise to the consumer relative to what they're promised far as performance
[4681.88 --> 4687.08]  I think it's okay. I mean everybody's going to have their own with the design to customize and set things up
[4687.80 --> 4693.48]  And as reviewers if that makes it harder for you guys in terms of trying to find a way to consistently benchmark a product
[4693.64 --> 4696.12]  That shouldn't stop a company from trying different alternatives
[4696.84 --> 4698.84]  To tweak and tune those designs
[4699.08 --> 4706.36]  I guess the thing that bothers me is like when you see nvidia and amd throttling the graphics cards in applications like furmark
[4706.60 --> 4712.60]  Furmark is stupid furmark should probably have never even existed from a benchmarking standpoint
[4712.92 --> 4716.20]  Because while it's interesting to find out the total uh
[4716.20 --> 4723.00]  The total power draw that you can get from a graphics card and benchmarkers love that stuff. It's no secret that it was
[4723.00 --> 4729.72]  able to damage cards because they just weren't designed to be run like that and the way that enthusiasts were using it
[4729.72 --> 4731.72]  Maybe firm art wasn't a bad tool
[4731.72 --> 4738.52]  But in the hands of enthusiasts who are used to you know running something for 24 hours or 48 hours to ensure it's stable
[4738.52 --> 4742.12]  I mean graphics cards were not meant to be run like that
[4742.84 --> 4748.92]  Particularly consumer grade ones because it comes down to that thing you said before about is it rated for 24 operation?
[4748.92 --> 4752.04]  If it's not then you probably shouldn't be using it that way
[4752.36 --> 4758.36]  But it looks like what samsung's saying is that it runs at 533 megahertz as advertised in
[4759.40 --> 4760.76]  s browser
[4760.76 --> 4761.64]  gallery
[4761.64 --> 4762.44]  camera
[4762.44 --> 4763.56]  video player
[4763.56 --> 4768.36]  And certain benchmarking apps which also demand substantial performance
[4769.48 --> 4774.20]  And i'm kind of looking at it going well what so your game doesn't demand substantial performance
[4774.20 --> 4777.96]  But it demands so much that you're throttling it down
[4778.20 --> 4783.88]  But then the gallery is fine and as a as a consumer this is kind of sketchy because it would be nicer
[4784.20 --> 4789.56]  Like jj said you can things things will change things will be different at different applications how things are created
[4790.36 --> 4795.40]  But I don't care as a consumer. I want to know how well it's going to perform if it's going to perform well in
[4795.72 --> 4803.16]  Your two applications and a benchmark. I do not care. I'm not going to lag out in s gallery or whatever they want to call their next
[4803.16 --> 4803.24]  Yeah
[4804.28 --> 4808.12]  That's that's a really good point that you bring up benchmarks actually matter a lot
[4808.12 --> 4813.40]  That's why we do real world benchmarks in all of our testing and show tons of different real world benchmarks running games
[4813.40 --> 4815.80]  So maybe consumers have to pay attention to different numbers
[4816.44 --> 4818.20]  Yeah, instead of just looking at synthetics
[4818.20 --> 4819.96]  That's a really good point
[4819.96 --> 4825.24]  But I think it's sometimes hard for you guys as reviewers right because sometimes there might not always be applications that you can
[4825.48 --> 4828.36]  Consistently and reliably execute to give you quantifiable numbers
[4828.68 --> 4834.12]  But at the same time too a lot of these applications who the heck can really understand them unless you're a diet
[4834.20 --> 4837.72]  Died in the wool enthusiast that knows all this information if I tell a user hey
[4838.44 --> 4840.44]  This graphics card got three
[4840.92 --> 4845.00]  Three thousand six hundred and seventy three and vantage what the heck does that mean to me?
[4845.00 --> 4848.68]  I don't know what the heck that means as a reviewer or somebody that runs it
[4848.68 --> 4854.92]  I know exactly what performance metric that means but to a gamer I want to know how many how many frames a second right?
[4854.92 --> 4856.92]  Can I play you know?
[4856.92 --> 4858.84]  You know whatever game it is that I want to play dude
[4858.84 --> 4860.68]  I just bought company heroes man
[4860.84 --> 4863.32]  Is it going to be smooth or is it not going to be smooth right?
[4863.48 --> 4864.76]  That's what you want to know?
[4864.76 --> 4872.28]  um, so that's I think just the jobs of ultimately these companies to figure out a way to get more effective real-world information to the user on
[4872.84 --> 4876.04]  What is relevant to them and not always have this reliance?
[4876.04 --> 4881.64]  I mean you could argue you're 100% right that you don't want anybody tuning these things to have these uh
[4882.20 --> 4889.08]  These cheating edges I guess in benchmarks just to win a benchmark right, but this is all like a self feeding mechanism, right?
[4889.08 --> 4894.68]  If we keep putting the focus and the onus on benchmarks then you are going to kind of expect these things
[4894.92 --> 4899.56]  If you put the focus on being what people are interested in that's where the focus will be on ultimately
[4899.56 --> 4908.36]  And it feels like just like you were saying a big part of the problem is that the tools don't exist to properly get real-world results on these platforms
[4908.68 --> 4921.08]  And it really does feel like android and ios so the mobile devices are basically where pc was like back in 2003 or 2001 when 3dmark
[4921.96 --> 4924.68]  ruled the roost and people really put a lot of
[4924.68 --> 4933.40]  uh a lot of stock in what that number spat out about their system and then it was revealed that amd was cheating or at ati at the time
[4933.40 --> 4937.32]  ati was cheating or nvidia was cheating or whoever was optimizing and
[4937.88 --> 4946.36]  gradually it moved away to the point where now on the desktop we're looking at advanced external capture setups that are actually trying to
[4947.64 --> 4952.52]  Show demonstrate exactly how many frames your eye is actually seeing and it just feels like
[4952.52 --> 4957.16]  It's going to make the mobile guys whether it's the uh the developers or whether it's the reviewers
[4957.56 --> 4960.84]  Have a bit of growing up to do and a bit of learning to do from pc
[4962.68 --> 4967.40]  Yeah well i mean that's what i tell anybody a lot of people that always say they want to break into this interest even like
[4967.40 --> 4972.76]  When we get people that apply for the company it was funny some of the i saw there was a person who was like how can i get a job at asus
[4973.00 --> 4976.04]  It's funny because you got a lot of people that are always attracted about the hotness
[4976.04 --> 4981.56]  For what we call our spg products, which is like tablets and like notebooks and and things like that, right?
[4981.80 --> 4982.92]  um, but
[4982.92 --> 4986.92]  The truth is that if you have a really deep good understanding on core components
[4986.92 --> 4991.00]  um, you have a much much better understanding of actually a lot of the integrated technologies
[4991.32 --> 4995.24]  Uh like tablets and this thing so you're right that definitely there's a lot that people could learn
[4995.48 --> 4998.68]  Um by being a little bit more hands-on with their technology and informing themselves
[4998.68 --> 5006.92]  Um, so that's just the nature of the beast, you know, we're in a technical industry and there's these are the things that everybody has to watch out as consumers and as reviewers and um
[5006.92 --> 5009.56]  You know, everybody's got to be on their toes and hopefully uh
[5009.56 --> 5012.76]  Put their their right foot forward and be honest and transparent. So
[5013.32 --> 5015.56]  It's not always as easy as everybody would like it to be
[5015.56 --> 5019.72]  But uh, I guess that's what separates the guys from the good uh from the guys that are not that good
[5020.68 --> 5026.44]  All right. Well, I think uh, we can based on how many people are tuned into the show today
[5026.44 --> 5030.44]  I think it's pretty safe to say that we have one of the guys who is good
[5031.08 --> 5036.04]  Who was featured today? Thank you so much for joining us. It's been absolutely awesome
[5036.04 --> 5040.44]  We've ran totally over time, but only because we've had way too much fun here
[5040.92 --> 5043.32]  And uh, I will leave it up to the audience
[5043.32 --> 5047.96]  But I think there's a pretty good chance that we're going to be extending an invitation to you at some point
[5048.20 --> 5051.56]  To join us again in the future. This has been absolutely awesome. Thanks, jj
[5052.04 --> 5055.88]  Not a problem. Thank you guys so much not only to yourself for uh, inviting me on the show
[5055.88 --> 5059.16]  I really appreciate it. Um, sorry if I ran a little bit long
[5059.16 --> 5062.84]  I tend to kind of do that sometimes so kind of factored that in man
[5064.28 --> 5068.68]  Um, and thank you just for all you guys that were just patient and listening to everything I I respect everybody's
[5069.24 --> 5072.28]  Opinion and I appreciate you guys that take the time to give it to us. So thank you
[5072.84 --> 5077.16]  All right guys, don't forget you can follow asus at asus usa
[5077.48 --> 5083.08]  Which happens to read exactly the same forward as it does backwards as one clever twitter follower pointed out to me
[5083.08 --> 5085.24]  So usa asus
[5085.24 --> 5088.36]  Well asus usa is the same as yeah, you know anyway
[5088.36 --> 5093.08]  Um, so guys you can you can follow asus on twitter there you can also
[5093.56 --> 5100.28]  Subscribe on youtube asus rog and make sure that you don't miss any updates from jj and the team. Thanks, man
[5100.84 --> 5102.68]  Yeah, I would also say um
[5102.76 --> 5106.76]  I think I talked to you about it too. If you guys see any posts for me and the the forums
[5106.76 --> 5111.56]  Uh, you can watch out for me, uh, and you'll know that it's me if it's uh asus illuminati all right
[5112.20 --> 5115.40]  All right sounds great. All right guys take care man take care
[5116.52 --> 5119.80]  All right, so i'm gonna remove his little icon here and turn off uh
[5120.44 --> 5125.08]  Shut off razor comms so guys we uh remember our live guests are brought to you by razer comms
[5125.24 --> 5129.40]  If you haven't tried razer comms for gaming yet, you can download it at the bitly link right here
[5129.40 --> 5136.12]  It helps us out a great deal if you do download razor comms and check it out because not only is it going to be a pretty
[5136.68 --> 5138.04]  Well, depending what you're using
[5138.04 --> 5139.80]  I mean some people have pretty elaborate setups
[5139.80 --> 5145.00]  But it can be an improvement for your voice communication with your crew and it's easy to get going and
[5145.64 --> 5146.04]  uh
[5146.04 --> 5151.56]  It also like I said helps us out a great deal because they are powering the wanshow these days
[5152.60 --> 5153.80]  so
[5153.80 --> 5158.20]  Shall we move on into some more topics here because we actually have a lot of topics this way
[5158.20 --> 5165.00]  We're gonna have to kind of blow through them pretty fast here. So usb 3.1 spec has been finalized
[5165.48 --> 5171.80]  Horns in on thunderbolts turf with 10 gigabit per second speeds. This is an ars technica article and uh
[5172.76 --> 5174.68]  super speed plus is what they're calling it
[5175.40 --> 5179.08]  Just like there's another one on the way like there's 3.2 on the way
[5179.40 --> 5184.60]  I heard rumors of and like thunderbolts moving forward and i've talked about this before when they started
[5184.60 --> 5191.56]  Coining like super phone and all that kind of stuff. We're gonna run out of just like we're gonna have to expand the english language to allow for more
[5191.88 --> 5197.72]  Technological we've already done that. Yes. I mean uber is not an english word and all the english people use it. Yep, that's true
[5198.44 --> 5203.16]  So maybe we can just yeah, we just grab things from other languages. We'll need all the languages
[5203.16 --> 5206.36]  So it'll be like usb super uber skukum
[5206.92 --> 5210.60]  Ownage like not even real words. It'll be like pwnage. Yeah. Yeah
[5211.56 --> 5215.72]  acronyms words everything all mixed in together to one string that will be the name of your device
[5215.72 --> 5217.48]  Then with like a plus on the end
[5217.48 --> 5220.60]  Definitely why not plus elite edition?
[5224.12 --> 5228.92]  Nice I can't wait till I can get elite edition usbs. I know right they better come in red
[5228.92 --> 5233.00]  They should totally come in red rog edition red and gold
[5233.72 --> 5235.56]  That is what asus needs to do next
[5235.56 --> 5240.52]  I hope jj is still watching because it's not enough to have gold edition boards and red edition boards
[5241.88 --> 5247.32]  Like striping yeah, or like military camo they should oh man with red and gold that'd be awesome
[5247.32 --> 5250.68]  So anyway 10 gigabit per second is as fast as current gen thunderbolt
[5250.68 --> 5255.00]  But thunderbolts going to be bumping to 20 gigabits per second very very very soon
[5255.00 --> 5258.84]  um, but it still lacks some of the features of thunderbolts
[5258.84 --> 5260.36]  So for example, it doesn't daisy chain
[5260.52 --> 5267.08]  So you can't just plug in a bunch of devices to one port and it doesn't carry a display signal although at 10 gigabit per second
[5267.08 --> 5269.08]  It probably could
[5269.40 --> 5274.60]  But remember guys that there's more to it than just the total throughput and just the connector
[5274.92 --> 5278.04]  There's protocols involved as well. So for example again
[5278.92 --> 5282.04]  I was going to mention this whether it's whether jj was our guest or not
[5282.04 --> 5287.72]  But on certain asus motherboards some of the usb3 controllers that they're using support a different mode called uasp
[5288.20 --> 5291.88]  Which runs a different protocol over the usb3 connector?
[5292.20 --> 5295.64]  And it requires a supported chipset and a supported device on the other one
[5295.64 --> 5299.40]  But actually optimizes it for small file transactions
[5299.64 --> 5301.64]  So if you were running like an os or
[5302.12 --> 5306.52]  Or you were working off of an external drive for something like editing video
[5306.52 --> 5310.36]  It is faster than regular usb3 and when we tested it
[5310.92 --> 5317.16]  It actually showed really really good performance improvements if you want to see that that's an old ncix tech tips video that we did a while back and
[5317.80 --> 5320.60]  It's it's it's really good in the right application
[5320.76 --> 5326.84]  And it was even faster than thunderbolt in certain applications and that was usb3 5 gigabit not 10 gigabit
[5327.08 --> 5332.20]  So it's more complicated than that folks which uh, I guess is bad news
[5332.20 --> 5336.92]  Uh, okay. We already did we already talked we already talked about the focus, right?
[5337.64 --> 5338.36]  Uh, yes
[5339.48 --> 5344.28]  I think we brought it up, but I don't really think we actually talked about it. Oh, okay. Well, I already
[5344.28 --> 5347.24]  It shocks your brain blah blah blah blah blah and then that's about it. We'll let you know how it goes
[5347.80 --> 5350.52]  Oh, oh, I've got a comms message from jj. He's back
[5351.16 --> 5356.60]  Hold on on a side note new thunderbolt does support daisy chain and concurrent video display 4k
[5357.24 --> 5363.32]  And data transfer so new thunderbolt is going to have even more feature advantages over usb3
[5363.88 --> 5370.76]  In addition to just the sheer throughput advantage that will be available to it more feature advantages than it already has
[5370.76 --> 5372.84]  Which is interesting extreme tech article
[5373.48 --> 5377.00]  One one sec just to jump back to focus the headset. Oh, yeah
[5377.64 --> 5381.32]  Shock brain shocking headset darpa is already using it to train snipers
[5381.96 --> 5386.20]  But they're not using that particular using there of course, but like the that technology
[5386.20 --> 5388.92]  But so the technology is actually
[5390.12 --> 5396.36]  Legit yeah, but whether this gaming grade device is actually gonna work or is gonna work meaningfully
[5396.60 --> 5399.32]  Whereas the fcc approved it so in theory it's safe
[5399.32 --> 5404.52]  But with that said it's easier to get something approved in the u.s. Than it is in canada and i'm not aware of any canadian
[5405.24 --> 5407.24]  approvals that are done on it, so
[5408.36 --> 5410.36]  It's directly here. So yeah, yeah
[5410.92 --> 5413.56]  Anyway, you still buy it but the bmwi3
[5413.56 --> 5418.36]  Cheap mass-produced carbon fiber cars finally coming
[5419.00 --> 5425.96]  This is fascinating because bmw was able to save it looks like oh crap. I forget it's in my news. Ah, yes
[5426.12 --> 5432.12]  They saved 250 to 350 kilograms or 550 to 770 pounds
[5432.12 --> 5439.64]  By using carbon fiber instead of steel for the construction of many of the large panels of this vehicle
[5439.96 --> 5444.04]  That means that the i3 is going to be one of the well
[5444.12 --> 5445.72]  It's basically going to be an electric car
[5446.52 --> 5448.52]  That is not
[5448.52 --> 5450.52]  super expensive
[5450.52 --> 5453.40]  By bmw standards. Yeah, I was just gonna say so
[5454.12 --> 5461.16]  40 000 yeah, I think it's 40 to 50. Yeah, yeah 50 less than 50 000 dollars is what they're what they're saying about
[5461.40 --> 5464.04]  super expensive so 49 99
[5465.16 --> 5467.80]  49 999 or whatever however, you would say that
[5468.12 --> 5473.48]  um, but it's going to be not super expensive compared to anything else
[5473.48 --> 5479.24]  It's not going to be super heavy compared to other electric vehicles because the weight savings that they're gaining
[5479.56 --> 5485.24]  Is going to be made up for by all the batteries that they have to chuck in it, but they're quoting a 100 mile range
[5485.88 --> 5490.12]  And uh, it's going to be available in the us in the second wave starting in 2014
[5491.40 --> 5495.72]  BMW actually you guys should check out the article because there's some interesting background on carbon fiber
[5495.72 --> 5502.60]  But pretty much they're taking a page out of the old automakers books where instead of just having uh steel
[5503.24 --> 5507.08]  You know pieces manufactured for them and then bringing them in to make to assemble cars
[5507.40 --> 5512.60]  BMW has actually invested heavily in the production process of carbon fiber
[5513.08 --> 5516.60]  So they're going to be involved at as vertically as possible
[5517.16 --> 5519.88]  In every component of the car, which I think is really cool
[5519.88 --> 5522.92]  And it's not like this hasn't been done before fundamentally
[5522.92 --> 5525.56]  But it hasn't been done before on a car that makes any amount of sense
[5526.12 --> 5530.28]  Like a practical person that it actually is buying a car to drive it actively
[5531.32 --> 5532.44]  Right like to work
[5534.04 --> 5539.72]  So it's kind of interesting still instead of it coming on some like insane sports car that two people will buy
[5540.12 --> 5543.00]  Yeah, but that said like the the tesla is doing all right
[5543.72 --> 5547.72]  Yeah, yeah, but again, that's a more premium and less practical
[5547.72 --> 5551.08]  It's not an suv where it's actually got like cargo space and all that kind of stuff
[5551.08 --> 5553.16]  120 000 for the base model
[5553.16 --> 5558.36]  Yeah, so we're talking about a very different experience here not that I don't love tesla like tesla's freaking awesome
[5558.36 --> 5561.16]  But to be able to acquire one is a little bit difficult
[5561.80 --> 5564.36]  I you know what? I totally forgot jj's a car guy
[5564.44 --> 5567.80]  He's messaging me now because I think he would have wanted to talk about that topic
[5568.12 --> 5571.16]  But he brought up jj would talk about all the topics that's that's true
[5571.16 --> 5574.12]  We should have just kept we should have just done a six-hour stream and have jj you know what?
[5574.12 --> 5579.08]  I don't think the audience would have even minded because we've got fewer viewers now that he's gone so
[5580.68 --> 5587.96]  At any rate, he makes a point that the jetta vw on diesel does 80 miles per gallon currently and if later could be even better
[5588.52 --> 5592.44]  And is already very reasonable on cost plus there are no issues overall with the infrastructure
[5592.44 --> 5597.08]  I wish diesel was more popular in north america. My first car was actually a 91
[5597.08 --> 5602.28]  uh volkswagen jetta diesel and when I uh when that car died it had about
[5603.16 --> 5609.56]  450 000 kilometers on it or something stupid like that like it lasted a really long time with no major work when that car died
[5610.12 --> 5614.44]  I was looking at everything from at the time phenomenally expensive hybrids
[5614.84 --> 5619.32]  to your standard like super civic and I was just floored by how
[5620.12 --> 5625.72]  How crappy they were on gas and how much more I was going to be paying for fuel jetta diesels are a fairly legendary car though
[5625.72 --> 5629.88]  Oh, awesome. Yeah, pretty ridiculous. So in a good way
[5631.00 --> 5639.40]  Um, all right, so this sounds more like a drug cartel than uh than what it actually is the nfc ring to control your okay
[5639.40 --> 5644.04]  No to control your smartphone actually up till that point. It sounds pretty good. Yeah, yeah
[5644.68 --> 5651.48]  Hits kickstarter goal in only three days now. I'm not much of an nfc dork, but what do you see this?
[5652.12 --> 5655.48]  Doing I'm really practical. I worry because I tend to lose things
[5656.28 --> 5660.92]  Okay, but if you don't tend to and like rings especially because they'll annoy me and I take them off and put them somewhere
[5660.92 --> 5664.52]  And then never find them again, so something like this wouldn't work for me specifically
[5664.52 --> 5668.44]  But I'm still really interested in it because someone who can wear a ring and not take it off
[5668.76 --> 5672.92]  Could use it for really interesting applications you have an open side and a closed side
[5673.16 --> 5678.12]  Yeah, so the open side is your open lock which is can be pretty easily accessible. They can't see your hand
[5678.12 --> 5678.68]  I'm not sure
[5678.68 --> 5679.24]  Just kind of well
[5679.24 --> 5682.92]  That's pretty blatant and I'm hitting the laptop so they can't see my hand
[5683.24 --> 5684.28]  But anyways
[5684.28 --> 5687.24]  Um, you can hit things with it quite easily and get through them
[5687.40 --> 5689.40]  But then the closed side is on the inside of your palms
[5689.40 --> 5691.56]  You have to very intentionally try to open it
[5691.56 --> 5696.36]  So if you have your house or a shed or your phone or whatever locked with the closed side
[5696.76 --> 5698.76]  You're not going to mistakenly unlock it
[5698.76 --> 5702.92]  And then the open side you can have for really really simple things that you still might want to have a lock on
[5703.24 --> 5704.12]  It's
[5704.12 --> 5707.96]  It's cool, and I think I'm not surprised that it hit its goal in three days
[5707.96 --> 5712.12]  And I'm happy it hit its goal in three days because we're going to see stuff like this more and more and more
[5713.00 --> 5718.68]  Um, what I saw that was really interesting was I saw a video on youtube that someone nfc tagged his own hand
[5719.00 --> 5721.24]  He injected an nfc tag into his own hand
[5721.24 --> 5721.72]  That's cool
[5721.72 --> 5722.84]  The whole thing is on video, it's nuts
[5723.24 --> 5728.36]  Um, and he was using it like his hand to unlock things and turn things on
[5728.36 --> 5729.32]  That was insane
[5729.32 --> 5730.76]  He could use his hand to turn me on
[5730.76 --> 5736.52]  Because that is where I see a lot of stuff going maybe I don't want to inject something into my hand
[5737.08 --> 5737.88]  but um
[5738.52 --> 5741.56]  You'll be able to just naturally do things instead of wearing stuff
[5741.56 --> 5742.60]  You know what would be so cool?
[5743.24 --> 5745.24]  Holy crap, okay, think think about this
[5745.80 --> 5751.96]  Like nfc enabled pillow so you lay down on it and you have an nfc tag in your head and your lights go off
[5753.96 --> 5754.36]  Whoa
[5755.40 --> 5756.76]  That would be awesome the door just rang
[5756.76 --> 5757.72]  The doorbell rang?
[5757.72 --> 5757.96]  Yeah
[5757.96 --> 5758.68]  Oh, okay
[5758.68 --> 5761.32]  Well, uh, I guess I'll handle the next topic in the meantime
[5761.56 --> 5762.60]  I already let okay
[5762.60 --> 5765.64]  There's like a chant of bring jj back in the twitch chat
[5765.88 --> 5770.52]  And I already let jj know that the audience is already asking when he's going to join us again
[5770.52 --> 5771.88]  So don't worry guys
[5771.88 --> 5773.88]  It's pretty much a done deal
[5773.96 --> 5775.88]  We will bring jj to join us again
[5775.88 --> 5777.48]  Who knows maybe next time?
[5777.72 --> 5781.88]  I'll be able to convince him to come up here and join us in person instead of calling in which would be
[5782.52 --> 5784.52]  phenomenally cool
[5784.52 --> 5786.52]  Uh, this is a really neat project
[5786.52 --> 5790.92]  But uh, whatever slick's not here and this is kind of his topic, but i'm just going to do it anyway
[5791.48 --> 5797.16]  So this guy modified this is on android headlines uh this this article
[5797.16 --> 5807.64]  modified a galaxy note 2 to carry 288 gigs of storage and an 8500 milliamp hour battery
[5808.20 --> 5811.80]  This is one of the craziest mods that i've ever seen
[5812.12 --> 5813.64]  That also is uh
[5813.64 --> 5821.24]  Is not is is is not it shouldn't have been that unobvious i guess i'm surprised someone didn't do it before
[5821.56 --> 5825.00]  But it just took someone with the right amount of craziness to go ahead and do it
[5825.00 --> 5827.00]  So so check this out right here
[5827.56 --> 5834.20]  Is a massive aftermarket battery that you'd probably normally find in something like um like an add-on
[5834.76 --> 5836.60]  Uh like uh like an aftermarket
[5836.60 --> 5842.76]  Back that would sort of actually be be molded for it and and would would cover it and would contain something like that
[5842.76 --> 5845.08]  It obviously doesn't fit 100% properly
[5845.64 --> 5851.16]  With with a stock back plate so you can see even this one has been modded in order to make it fit
[5851.40 --> 5861.56]  And then this right here is a ribbon cable adapter from the micro sd slot to a full-sized sd slot that contains a 256 gigabyte sd card
[5861.56 --> 5867.56]  Now to be clear guys a 256 gig sd card you could buy yourself a new phone
[5868.60 --> 5870.60]  For what you're going to spend on that sd card
[5871.00 --> 5877.72]  But if you do ultimately want like the ultimate super phone that lasts for days and days and days
[5878.12 --> 5883.80]  And has enough storage to hold your like the bulk of your music and like video collection
[5883.80 --> 5888.20]  That uh, this this looks like kind of the way to do it and it's uh
[5888.84 --> 5892.04]  I believe it was the original post was on xda developers
[5892.04 --> 5894.84]  So you should go go go and check this out remember guys
[5894.84 --> 5897.80]  We do post the document when I finally get around to it
[5898.20 --> 5903.24]  Um on the forum so you can check out all of the links to everything we discuss is anything you had to add about that one?
[5903.24 --> 5908.20]  I think it's cool because we were looking at the edge last week and something that was brought up multiple times
[5908.20 --> 5913.80]  Is that it's bleeding edge and finally has some stuff that's actually different and they're trying to be differentiate themselves?
[5913.80 --> 5915.32]  Because you see so many phones that are identical
[5915.96 --> 5920.36]  The edge paired with this shows people want extreme phones now
[5921.16 --> 5924.52]  You know why doesn't anyone put a full-size sd slot in a phone?
[5924.92 --> 5928.28]  Why not people want crazy features and why isn't it in a tablet?
[5929.16 --> 5931.56]  Like that actually that one to me is okay
[5931.56 --> 5939.08]  So it all comes back to micro usb for me the thing that pisses me off about micro usb is it's a garbage connector
[5939.64 --> 5945.08]  It's not durable at all. We had another one break today on our usb3 hub. Yeah, i'm super mad
[5945.64 --> 5948.76]  Um, so we had yet another micro usb connector break
[5949.24 --> 5953.32]  Why is why do we have to miniaturize things when it's completely unnecessary?
[5953.80 --> 5957.88]  mini be on almost every even modern smartphone
[5958.44 --> 5965.00]  with the exception of maybe like htc1 mini be probably could have worked
[5966.60 --> 5972.68]  And it's a much more robust connector on your galaxy s3. There's no way a mini be connector wouldn't have worked there
[5973.24 --> 5980.76]  Absolutely, it would have and so to me something like micro sd is like or micro sim or what is the new one nano sim?
[5980.92 --> 5984.84]  I think the uh the upcoming droid x is going to use or moto x is going to use it
[5985.24 --> 5985.64]  um
[5985.64 --> 5986.52]  um
[5986.52 --> 5987.64]  Why
[5987.72 --> 5991.56]  was there not room for an sd card in something like um
[5992.12 --> 5994.44]  sim i don't care for something like a nexus 7
[5995.32 --> 6000.60]  sim the functionality hasn't changed but but like an sd card where you get greater capacities and greater speed
[6001.16 --> 6006.84]  Which is one of the problems that android and that google has with allowing people to use
[6007.56 --> 6011.32]  Expansion cards is that they're so slow and unreliable and crappy
[6011.32 --> 6015.80]  Well, if they weren't micro sd they wouldn't be quite as bad and you wouldn't have quite the same
[6016.20 --> 6016.84]  um
[6016.84 --> 6022.92]  Slow down issues when running apps and all that kind of stuff that you do with those micro sd cards if you just put in a little bit more space
[6022.92 --> 6030.12]  And put a full-size sd in it and I think people would be willing if there was a like tiny tiny expansion of the actual size of the phone
[6030.60 --> 6035.00]  Because I don't know the last time I saw people actually care when people are like oh
[6035.00 --> 6035.80]  It's
[6035.80 --> 6039.72]  0.2 nanometers thinner everyone goes and puts a bloody case on it anyway
[6039.72 --> 6043.48]  Yeah, like just give it a little bit more space and put a better thing in there
[6044.04 --> 6046.04]  been asking for it for a long time
[6046.76 --> 6048.92]  so six cops showed up uh
[6050.04 --> 6050.84]  and
[6050.84 --> 6057.72]  Inconveniently for the police, uh the lady who lives there this uh was submitted by uk curse curtis 1995 on the forum
[6058.12 --> 6061.96]  uh the article we're linking to is from the atlantic wire so inconveniently for
[6062.52 --> 6066.84]  for the cops um the lady who lives there happens to be a pretty decent writer
[6066.84 --> 6069.96]  I actually clicked through to her her write-up about it
[6069.96 --> 6077.48]  So michelle catalano was looking for information online about pressure cookers her husband in the same time frame was googling backpacks
[6078.04 --> 6083.08]  And uh there were some questions that the cops had about things that their son had been looking up as well
[6083.40 --> 6087.56]  But ultimately they had six cops show up while she wasn't home while her husband was there
[6088.20 --> 6094.36]  Introduced themselves as police asked to be let in search the home because they had and they basically asked outright
[6094.36 --> 6097.32]  Do you have any bombs here? Why are you researching pressure cookers?
[6097.48 --> 6104.28]  Why are you looking up how pressure cooker bombs work to which the husband replied and this guy's awesome because I don't think I would have had the balls to say this to the cops
[6105.40 --> 6108.84]  Well after the boston bombings didn't you look it up?
[6109.08 --> 6112.28]  Weren't you curious and two of them answered yes two of them were like yeah
[6113.16 --> 6115.16]  I was kind of curious too. So it's kind of like
[6116.76 --> 6120.12]  Like they they left and everything was sort of fine and hunky-dory
[6120.12 --> 6126.68]  But what the cops said was they do about a hundred of these calls a week and 99 of them are nothing
[6127.08 --> 6128.92]  And it just makes you kind of go like
[6129.56 --> 6132.20]  This is how closely we're being monitored at this point
[6132.68 --> 6137.08]  And another thing to add in heaven forbid you want to make like stew
[6138.60 --> 6144.68]  And like go to school part of the problem is that she worked at a workplace and had done searches about pressure bombs there
[6144.68 --> 6148.52]  A lot of people i've seen this come up quite a bit is
[6149.16 --> 6153.32]  There's additional stuff and they were tipped off by a workplace not just a wiretap
[6154.04 --> 6155.00]  They had a like
[6155.88 --> 6160.44]  A submission from a workplace saying that she had she had been fired or she quit or something. I don't remember everything
[6160.92 --> 6165.96]  Um, and she had done searches for backpack bombs and pressure hookers at work on a work laptop
[6165.96 --> 6170.04]  Yeah, that's a little bit that does that a little in fact
[6170.04 --> 6175.16]  She has an addendum to her article that includes that it was also I think it was I think it was actually her husband's work
[6175.16 --> 6181.24]  Where he was looking things something something like yeah, but at any rate even then the fact that they're I mean
[6181.48 --> 6183.08]  I would kind of go
[6183.08 --> 6185.72]  Uh, okay me to a lesser extent because i'm not that anonymous
[6185.72 --> 6191.72]  But if i'm just average joe with a job and a wife and a family, you know, just nothing out of the ordinary
[6191.72 --> 6198.52]  I would go who's actually monitoring what i'm doing closely enough that they bother to know where i work
[6198.84 --> 6203.56]  And they bother to know where i live and they are actually putting two and two together
[6204.20 --> 6210.84]  That like at my office and my home i'm looking up things that might be related and it might be a terrorist. Yeah
[6211.24 --> 6213.24]  I mean that is just
[6213.96 --> 6218.84]  I totally i'm on your side. I just wanted to clarify that there was other sides of the story that's all
[6218.84 --> 6220.84]  It's because yeah, yeah
[6220.84 --> 6225.80]  I mean to me that almost doesn't really help that almost makes it worse exactly
[6226.36 --> 6231.72]  Um, so this is uh, this is an interesting net neutrality topic google fiber
[6231.72 --> 6236.68]  So in their terms of service they've said that they don't want you hosting servers
[6237.16 --> 6241.00]  For google fiber, so I did find a number of of articles about it get it
[6241.00 --> 6243.24]  I got a number of different perspectives on it
[6243.24 --> 6247.40]  And I think this was one of the worst bits of journalism i've ever seen out of the verge
[6248.20 --> 6250.20]  They blew this completely
[6251.56 --> 6254.84]  Out of proportion this coming last week when you suggested everyone go there
[6255.16 --> 6257.24]  I know i know i know i know
[6257.88 --> 6262.84]  And I love the verge still but this was very sensationalist was the way they presented this in fact
[6262.92 --> 6266.76]  Everyone's getting i i think i'm gonna play devil's advocate advocate a bit here
[6267.00 --> 6272.76]  Everyone I think is getting a little bit sensationalist because the net neutrality concept is a couple of things and it's that
[6272.76 --> 6277.48]  Um service providers shouldn't be able to control
[6277.96 --> 6280.84]  How you use the service that they're providing to you particularly
[6281.40 --> 6287.80]  They shouldn't be able to dictate how you're using it in a way that is anti-competitive with other services
[6287.80 --> 6291.40]  so for example if um someone like uh
[6293.64 --> 6296.84]  Comcast were to say okay well we're your cable provider
[6296.84 --> 6298.52]  We're also your internet provider
[6298.52 --> 6303.40]  And we're gonna make it so that your internet connection is shoddy when you're using services like netflix
[6303.80 --> 6308.20]  Whereas we're gonna leave the pipes wide open for our own cable tv service
[6308.76 --> 6310.52]  That is a net neutrality issue
[6311.00 --> 6314.12]  I personally don't think that google coming out and saying
[6314.68 --> 6316.84]  I'm gonna go and find the exact wording here
[6316.84 --> 6317.88]  I don't think google saying
[6317.88 --> 6323.32]  You should not host any type of server using your google fiber connection
[6323.96 --> 6333.16]  use use of your google fiber account to provide a large number of people with internet access or use of your google fiber account to provide commercial services to third parties is
[6335.16 --> 6337.56]  And not permitted I paraphrased a little bit there
[6337.56 --> 6342.92]  The the first line the not able to run servers I think is going to be overlooked a lot
[6342.92 --> 6345.00]  I know you have this in your notes and I agree with you
[6345.00 --> 6350.04]  The second lines commercial services and allowing a large number of people to access the internet
[6350.04 --> 6356.12]  I think that's more what they're actually focused on is if you want to run something like a big application online
[6356.12 --> 6357.72]  If you want to run twitter out of your house
[6358.36 --> 6358.76]  Right
[6358.76 --> 6361.48]  Just to give a totally blown out of proportion example
[6361.48 --> 6363.96]  But if you want to run twitter out of your house, I think they're saying okay
[6364.60 --> 6365.40]  No
[6365.40 --> 6371.08]  Right or if you wanted to start up your own uh video on demand streaming service because let's face it
[6371.08 --> 6375.64]  If someone was running a video on demand streaming service out of their home internet connection
[6375.64 --> 6377.72]  I can tell you right now it ain't legit
[6377.72 --> 6378.12]  No
[6378.12 --> 6381.48]  And that's that's not that's not legal content that's being streamed
[6381.88 --> 6385.32]  And that is not the intended use of google fiber
[6385.32 --> 6390.60]  But I think if you're running like if you want to run your own cod server minecraft server or something like that or team speak server
[6390.60 --> 6393.40]  Like they've said multiplayer gaming isn't going to be a problem
[6393.40 --> 6393.72]  Yeah
[6393.72 --> 6399.24]  Even though their terms of service do actually prohibit the running of a server
[6399.72 --> 6401.72]  My isp prohibits running a server
[6401.72 --> 6404.92]  I use shaw here in the lower mainland you're not you're not supposed to run
[6405.48 --> 6407.56]  A server off of a residential connection
[6407.96 --> 6410.04]  I've had a file server running off of it
[6410.04 --> 6413.16]  I even do nightly backups so like nightly synchronizations
[6413.16 --> 6416.20]  That's going to look an awful lot like server activity from their side
[6416.76 --> 6420.52]  There's no way they're fooled that i'm not using my internet connection for that
[6420.52 --> 6425.24]  But they turn a blind eye because i'm not running a video on demand service
[6425.24 --> 6432.12]  I'm not the next you know internet startup that's you know starting the new pinterest or whatever on
[6432.44 --> 6433.80]  What is it's in beta?
[6433.80 --> 6441.40]  It's meant to be a consumer grade thing and and so basically what they're saying is to prevent the use
[6442.04 --> 6444.04]  to to prevent
[6444.12 --> 6444.52]  um
[6444.52 --> 6448.28]  It being your usage shouldn't be detrimental to the other users on the service
[6448.28 --> 6456.36]  And if everyone was pinning their connection at a gigabit up a gigabit down at all times because they're doing whatever they're doing
[6457.08 --> 6460.60]  That that's detrimental to the point where it's it's not reasonable
[6460.92 --> 6463.08]  I think for consumer grade connection
[6463.96 --> 6469.96]  Yeah, with the flip side being that google was very outspoken about the other providers and net neutrality and all that
[6469.96 --> 6473.88]  But I just I just don't feel this is a net neutrality issue because it's not a um
[6473.88 --> 6479.16]  It's it's not a competitive advantage that they're going for here. It's yeah
[6479.72 --> 6482.36]  And but at the same time I have to fight for the other side too
[6482.68 --> 6485.32]  Whereas if you're paying for something I think you should be able to use it all
[6486.20 --> 6488.20]  On the other hand you look at again
[6488.20 --> 6494.76]  This is back to jj's point about if something is rated for 24 7 operation when you buy a residential grade connection
[6495.32 --> 6498.04]  They're not guaranteeing you 99.9 uptime
[6498.04 --> 6502.04]  They're not guaranteeing you the ability to run that connection 24 7 pegged all day
[6502.04 --> 6505.88]  We already know that there's provisioning but then there's that that you should have to deal with that though
[6506.44 --> 6509.96]  Okay, that should be your service going offline. That should be your service being throttled
[6511.16 --> 6516.12]  Oh, I see so you're saying don't limit someone's ability to do it to do it
[6516.12 --> 6520.68]  But if there's problems with it, that's their fault. They're not buying a business plan. They're not paying for a business plan
[6521.08 --> 6527.88]  They're not paying for that super high-end thing. They're running something kind of not designed for that and if it fails, that's their problem
[6528.28 --> 6529.48]  Okay, fair enough
[6529.48 --> 6534.52]  All right, let's move on to our next topic because this one I think is going to be pretty quick. I actually can't
[6535.08 --> 6539.72]  It's inexplicable to me that this was so widely reported on I think this was on
[6539.96 --> 6540.92]  It was on okay
[6540.92 --> 6545.88]  So the links here are to the eve community as well as to huffington post this was submitted by half sandwich
[6546.04 --> 6549.40]  But I think bbc had it as well the verge had it as well
[6549.56 --> 6556.04]  So $20,000 of real-world money ships were lost in what has been confirmed by eve's developers
[6556.04 --> 6563.24]  To be the largest spaceship battle of all time in eve over some base or something and
[6563.80 --> 6568.60]  It's been some like months long campaign you played eve. How big of a deal is this?
[6568.60 --> 6570.76]  I'm subscribed right now. You're still subscribed
[6570.76 --> 6575.64]  I got too anticipated for star citizen. No way you're back on eve
[6576.36 --> 6580.28]  Wow, how do you have time for this? I haven't been working you hard enough. I don't really actually
[6580.28 --> 6585.40]  I've played for i've had i've been subscribed for like a week. I've played for like two hours. Okay, so like
[6586.44 --> 6592.36]  Oh, wow, you're back into eve. Yeah, I want spaceships. I'm tired of waiting for star citizen. We don't have alpha yet
[6593.08 --> 6598.04]  Once we have alpha coming in like 20 days by the time your month's long subscription is over
[6598.04 --> 6600.68]  It's pretty lined up actually you said 20 days. I've been on for seven days
[6600.68 --> 6603.08]  It's a month long so you're gonna
[6604.04 --> 6606.04]  Whatever talk about the space battle
[6606.84 --> 6608.84]  It's it's cool, and it's so widely
[6609.48 --> 6615.24]  Reported on because it's twenty thousand dollars in a video game people that aren't interested in video games went holy cow
[6615.56 --> 6621.64]  People lost twenty thousand dollars in a video game. They actually probably actually reading most of the comments on the verge. They went holy cow
[6622.68 --> 6627.56]  Why do you care people spend twenty thousand dollars on a video game? Well, they didn't spend twenty thousand dollars on video games
[6627.56 --> 6634.28]  Right, that's actually a very good point is you should explain how these sensationalist headlines actually didn't necessarily have much to do
[6634.68 --> 6636.68]  With how much the spaceships actually
[6637.16 --> 6642.76]  Cost okay, so like on your credit card they're translating money in the game to things called plexes
[6642.92 --> 6647.08]  This is how they're doing the calculation you can buy a plex outside of the game with your credit card
[6647.72 --> 6651.40]  It's game time. That's what you're buying when you're buying a plexes. You're buying game time
[6651.64 --> 6655.72]  You can then sell that item the plex in game on the market for x amount of money
[6655.72 --> 6660.60]  There's websites you can go to that estimate the the average cost of a plex at a certain point in time
[6660.76 --> 6666.12]  So what they do is they translate that amount of isk which is in game money and then that's your real life money
[6666.68 --> 6671.48]  But how many people are actually buying these plexes? It's a lot is you can't just
[6672.28 --> 6678.28]  translate that to real life money because buying a ship in the game with isk you can't translate isk into dollars
[6678.28 --> 6680.28]  You can translate dollars into isk
[6682.60 --> 6685.08]  It's kind of you're missing like an end, but um
[6685.72 --> 6691.48]  You can't translate you can translate dollars into isk, but not isk into dollars unless you're an illegal operation selling isk
[6692.28 --> 6696.20]  Right, so it doesn't actually work. You're you're playing the game
[6696.20 --> 6700.52]  You're gathering money like in every mmo as far as I know you're gathering some type of resource
[6700.52 --> 6706.52]  And then you're spending it on things when you lose those things that will always translate to some amount of money in a really
[6707.08 --> 6709.56]  Funky math kind of way, okay, but it's not real
[6710.20 --> 6716.44]  All right next topic moscow subway uses devices to read sims on phones
[6717.56 --> 6720.68]  so this is one that especially after the whole like
[6721.48 --> 6729.64]  Jawbone technology to play ads in your head thing also going on in russia how friggin insane is this so this is from rfriel
[6729.64 --> 6731.64]  uh, dot org and
[6731.96 --> 6734.84]  Basically what they're saying about it is it's not
[6735.88 --> 6741.72]  Again, they the headline on our forum was a little bit sensationalist each on though talking to you
[6743.08 --> 6747.80]  Because what they're going to be able to read is the sim card from about five meters away
[6748.20 --> 6753.56]  And what moscow saying is that it is illegal to track a person without permission from the authorities
[6754.36 --> 6755.80]  however
[6755.80 --> 6756.84]  Okay
[6756.84 --> 6758.84]  So this is from that. Yeah, so
[6759.48 --> 6764.28]  Okay, that was their head of police is saying it's illegal to track a person without permission from the authorities, but when you are the authorities
[6765.24 --> 6772.76]  I don't know okay. It's russia. Yeah, and there is but there was no law against tracking the property of a company
[6772.76 --> 6778.12]  Such as a sim card so is this where that whole you don't own your sim card?
[6779.00 --> 6780.12]  loophole
[6780.12 --> 6780.76]  Oh
[6780.76 --> 6782.52]  becomes very ugly
[6782.52 --> 6784.04]  That's so brutal
[6784.84 --> 6785.40]  Wow
[6785.40 --> 6788.28]  So the idea is oh well
[6788.28 --> 6792.84]  It could be used to track stolen phones or missing persons. What's a missing person?
[6792.84 --> 6796.60]  Someone you're tracking and you can't find that's right
[6796.60 --> 6799.96]  That's so brutal
[6799.96 --> 6800.60]  So pretty
[6800.60 --> 6801.96]  I hadn't read that line
[6801.96 --> 6802.92]  That's incredible
[6802.92 --> 6804.92]  It's the very last line of the actual article
[6804.92 --> 6805.96]  It's kind of hidden in there
[6805.96 --> 6810.28]  That's the lawmakers going oh we found a loophole in our own thing. Let's exploit it
[6810.28 --> 6813.96]  So basically we can't look for you unless we have permission from us
[6813.96 --> 6820.76]  Maybe there's someone else they need permission from but come on. Let's face it unless we have permission from someone who we work very closely with
[6821.48 --> 6821.96]  um
[6821.96 --> 6828.68]  We can't track you, but we can track that thing that you carry around which is like always going to be attached to you and
[6829.48 --> 6834.60]  You know what's a missing person? I don't know someone who we can't find. Yeah
[6836.44 --> 6842.12]  Oh, man, that's brutal. So yeah, that's uh, that's like that's like super la disappoint
[6842.12 --> 6846.12]  I think for anyone living in Russia who wants to take the subway at any point in time
[6846.76 --> 6848.76]  um
[6848.76 --> 6850.76]  Oh
[6850.76 --> 6855.48]  300 gig discs so steven shares this with me on twitter usually guys
[6855.48 --> 6859.72]  Please post your news items in the news section of the linus tech tips forum because I usually am not
[6860.28 --> 6864.60]  um sort of together enough to share things with myself on twitter and get things uh
[6865.16 --> 6866.28]  whoa
[6866.28 --> 6869.72]  xkcd's time comic comes to an end after more than 3 000 panels what
[6869.72 --> 6873.48]  That's not cool. I didn't even see that before
[6874.36 --> 6874.52]  huh
[6875.72 --> 6878.20]  That's sad. Sorry. That's hidden by the uh
[6878.76 --> 6880.92]  It's it's up here. There you go that one
[6881.48 --> 6885.64]  Anyway, this this one's on the verge so sony and panasonic team up to create
[6886.20 --> 6894.28]  300 gig discs of the future and I think the real question here from my perspective is why do we need a 300 gig disc of the future?
[6894.28 --> 6898.20]  They say it could be ready in 2015. It would be extremely high capacity
[6898.60 --> 6901.16]  They're joint sony and panasonic are jointly developing it
[6901.16 --> 6901.96]  um
[6901.96 --> 6906.12]  High capacity just to store things like high definition film move large amounts of data around
[6907.24 --> 6908.84]  What's what's the value of this?
[6908.84 --> 6912.84]  I was actually kind of interested because under that there's a note that says this is awesome
[6913.64 --> 6915.64]  I thought that was you
[6915.96 --> 6918.04]  What in the notes for the forum, you know what?
[6918.04 --> 6923.32]  I bet that was jj who put it in I bet i'm about to get another message on comms because he's a high definition
[6923.88 --> 6931.88]  Uncompressed aficionado and at 300 gigs you could actually be able to have very high bit rate
[6932.60 --> 6933.72]  movies
[6933.72 --> 6938.68]  In and and and if they can deliver it by 2014 then for the people who want that
[6938.68 --> 6940.44]  I mean, it's not like google fiber is going to be
[6941.24 --> 6946.20]  everywhere no no by that point in time and unlimited internet connections even in
[6946.20 --> 6952.60]  First world developed countries or whatever you want to call them are not necessarily a thing and like jj said earlier
[6952.60 --> 6954.04]  It's gonna be choked
[6954.04 --> 6954.84]  Yeah, it'll be thought
[6954.84 --> 6957.40]  It'll be throttled somewhere. It won't be a side bit rate all that kind of stuff
[6957.64 --> 6961.00]  It makes sense for people like he's typing already. There he is
[6961.24 --> 6963.80]  It makes sense for people like jj. That's awesome, but
[6964.44 --> 6968.92]  It doesn't make sense for that many people so i'm interesting that they're trying so hard to get this going
[6968.92 --> 6970.52]  I think it'll be somewhat niche
[6970.52 --> 6976.68]  However, it should be noted that optical media still has advantages compared to other media like for example
[6977.56 --> 6979.80]  For the longest time you've had people
[6981.00 --> 6987.32]  People so many people have come up to me and come up with the awesome idea that you should buy albums on a usb thumb drive instead of on a cd
[6987.72 --> 6992.92]  And the problem with that was in about 10 years almost any flash based device
[6992.92 --> 6996.12]  If you haven't provided any power to it will degrade
[6997.16 --> 7001.72]  It's it's a known thing. It's a problem whereas a physical media that is
[7002.28 --> 7005.80]  Stamped unless it is subject to some kind of extreme
[7006.28 --> 7011.24]  Stress such as direct sunlight for an extended period of time or just horrendous conditions
[7011.64 --> 7016.04]  Um is going to last a much much longer amount of time
[7016.68 --> 7020.28]  So is there still space for optical media for me personally?
[7020.28 --> 7026.52]  I give zero cares because a netflix stream is already already looks as good to me as I will ever care about
[7026.52 --> 7027.56]  I'm not a film
[7027.96 --> 7032.20]  I don't geek out over film. I don't geek out over image quality except in games
[7033.00 --> 7034.04]  um
[7034.04 --> 7034.52]  however
[7037.48 --> 7042.84]  There will be a use case for it there all there always be at least one person and if there's at least one person that's
[7043.64 --> 7046.60]  That you can notice there's tons more behind that person. Yep
[7046.60 --> 7050.84]  So there will be people that buy this like i'm assuming jj. Yeah, okay
[7050.84 --> 7054.12]  There you go. He finished typing his message, which is very long which is unlike him
[7054.60 --> 7056.84]  I
[7056.84 --> 7061.24]  Love me my blu-ray also from a long-term archive perspective
[7061.24 --> 7064.44]  I like to have a reliable medium for taking content and backing it up
[7064.76 --> 7070.28]  I do archiving of my photography on blu-ray, but 4k with uncompressed audio is what it is all about
[7070.28 --> 7073.88]  Although with blu-ray disc excel and better compression
[7073.88 --> 7077.72]  We could probably get away with very high quality 4k and 24-bit audio
[7078.04 --> 7081.88]  So that sounds like an argument both for and against a 300 gigabyte format
[7081.96 --> 7087.48]  Maybe we we do need more on optical, but we maybe don't need 300 gigabyte anytime soon
[7087.48 --> 7090.68]  But hey you look at how long it takes a standard to become
[7091.32 --> 7092.68]  everywhere
[7092.68 --> 7099.16]  Just because it's available in 2014 doesn't mean that yeah, it's mainstream at that point and what's what's that disc called the memory disc?
[7099.16 --> 7100.52]  um
[7100.52 --> 7107.80]  I think lg makes the drive mdisc mdisc once they get mdisc that big asus has an upcoming drive that supports mdisc actually
[7107.96 --> 7114.28]  Okay, cool. So mdisc is that permanent archival media once they get a disc that big in that
[7115.00 --> 7119.56]  Standard someone will be interested. That's awesome. Yeah, that's cool in my opinion because right now
[7119.56 --> 7121.72]  I personally think compared to dvd
[7122.04 --> 7127.56]  Or even even blu-ray in some cases although I haven't priced it out recently because blu-ray discs used to be quite expensive
[7127.56 --> 7133.72]  You were better off just buying hard drives and putting them on a shelf in terms of archiving your archiving your data, so
[7134.92 --> 7141.00]  uh, alright last last news article of the week before we move on to build logs of the week and wrap things up
[7141.56 --> 7144.84]  Nvidia prototypes their own vr
[7145.40 --> 7146.76]  headset
[7146.76 --> 7148.28]  So this is really cool
[7148.28 --> 7152.92]  The article is from tech hive and it was posted on the forum by no name 79 31
[7152.92 --> 7160.44]  And what nvidia has done is they have used a very very interesting array of micro
[7160.92 --> 7166.84]  Displays with a very unique lens setup to create something that achieves
[7167.40 --> 7172.04]  Stereo 3d as well as like a virtual reality so um
[7172.52 --> 7176.44]  A display that's sitting right next to your eye pretty much. It's about this far away
[7176.44 --> 7178.04]  But looks like it's much further away
[7178.04 --> 7183.88]  So without the same kinds of crazy optics and huge headgear that oculus rift is doing they've created something that is
[7184.44 --> 7191.48]  Less than a cent or about a centimeter thick and sits on your eyes and allows you to uh to see in 3d
[7191.48 --> 7195.64]  And this this prototype is actually you guys have to check out the video
[7196.28 --> 7203.88]  Um the nvidia video right here down by the end of the tech hive article near eye light field displays is outstanding
[7203.88 --> 7210.52]  So it covers some of the limitations of the technology, which is that the this the display image will be quite blurry
[7210.92 --> 7214.60]  Particularly with the resolutions that we have available and the fact that it's a weird random
[7214.92 --> 7222.04]  Prototype where they like they took apart some like head mounted display and like frankensteined it together with some other thing
[7223.00 --> 7224.20]  um
[7224.20 --> 7225.64]  I don't remember where I was going with this
[7225.64 --> 7229.64]  But it's very cool and it could be an indication of where we're heading in the future oculus
[7230.20 --> 7232.60]  I mean you look at how much attention they're getting
[7232.60 --> 7239.88]  They weren't going to be the only one forever no, and it's good to have competition and oculus is pushing really hard doesn't matter still good to have competition
[7240.28 --> 7240.76]  um
[7240.76 --> 7245.88]  One thing that's going to be interesting and I know nvidia is going to have huge marketing muscle behind it, but uh
[7246.44 --> 7248.12]  everyone's developing for oculus
[7248.76 --> 7250.20]  nvidia is
[7250.20 --> 7254.04]  Just an assumption very possibly going to have a proprietary platform
[7254.68 --> 7258.76]  But that would make me really sad. I hope that oculus gains enough traction
[7258.76 --> 7266.44]  Before nvidia comes in because I mean the thing with stereo 3d and why nvidia got away with it there is that the other solutions were terrible
[7267.00 --> 7272.20]  The existing ones were just terrible so they were able to come in and say yeah, we have the only good solution so
[7273.24 --> 7277.16]  boom boom boom lock all the doors this is a closed play area guys
[7277.64 --> 7279.32]  Whereas if oculus is already great
[7279.32 --> 7285.32]  Then nvidia might have to play nice yeah, because it worries me for that for the I almost just said ati users
[7285.88 --> 7289.48]  AMD users that if if it's locked down won't be able to actually use it
[7290.04 --> 7293.00]  So it becomes becomes kind of interesting and then if they can't use it
[7293.48 --> 7296.52]  Who how many people are going to be developing for it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[7297.08 --> 7299.08]  speaking of locked down and
[7299.08 --> 7303.00]  It's not for AMD users project shield from nvidia
[7303.00 --> 7310.20]  The the gaming where you're actually streaming your desktop gpus power to your nvidia shield portable device
[7310.20 --> 7312.92]  No, no, we're not going to show them the actual demo yet. I'm just going to hold it up
[7313.48 --> 7317.24]  So we've been working on we don't have a we don't have an nvidia shield device yet
[7317.24 --> 7319.16]  But we've been working on what we call the ghetto shield
[7319.16 --> 7322.84]  Which we'll be talking about in much more detail in the after party
[7323.16 --> 7327.72]  But basically it's a phone mount that goes to an xbox 360 controller
[7327.72 --> 7336.28]  That uses an app that you can just download for free for your phone to stream a game from your desktop pc in a way that
[7336.28 --> 7337.24]  We think is pretty cool
[7337.24 --> 7338.84]  So we'll talk more about that later
[7338.84 --> 7344.84]  And you can build one of these assuming you already have a phone and an xbox controller for about three dollars
[7345.96 --> 7352.76]  If you don't know where to buy like phone xbox controller some glue some old side panels and glue so more on that later
[7352.76 --> 7356.84]  Let's do let's do builds of the week awesome. Okay, so there is a link in there
[7357.64 --> 7362.04]  Is there is there a link there almost wasn't oh well that was close?
[7363.32 --> 7365.40]  All right, let's download this bad boy
[7366.36 --> 7371.96]  I hope google docs. I think I say this every single week. I hope google docs gets better support for viewing it in the browser
[7372.20 --> 7377.48]  I know that's the powerpoint files are the one thing where it's just kind of assy breaks a little bit
[7377.72 --> 7383.00]  Yeah, and not assy like you know plump and juicy assy like saggy and wrinkled assy
[7383.00 --> 7388.84]  That needed description. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that needed to be said. Oh, yeah
[7389.48 --> 7391.00]  Oh, this is annoying. It's uh
[7391.96 --> 7394.92]  I'm trying to download it and it's just being assy
[7395.96 --> 7397.64]  Again the wrinkled assy
[7397.64 --> 7401.24]  The bad one this time. Yeah, all right. No, it was always the bad one
[7402.20 --> 7404.60]  It's just sort of how bad it manages to be
[7407.88 --> 7411.72]  You know we were this close to not having any technical difficulties on the stream this week
[7411.72 --> 7413.40]  Except for being like half an hour long
[7413.40 --> 7418.28]  Well, it's okay except for but that was mostly to do with the fact that it takes b-roll twice as long to get here as
[7418.84 --> 7423.24]  It does me and from the studio and the blue screen and b-roll had the camera
[7423.24 --> 7424.44]  Oh, right that in the stream
[7424.44 --> 7426.20]  Blue screen and we don't like anymore
[7426.20 --> 7430.28]  I knew it was gonna blue screen though. I was sure like that black magic intensity
[7430.28 --> 7432.12]  I've almost gotten to the point where I can go yeah
[7432.12 --> 7436.84]  When I do this it's gonna blue screen, but I have to do this because otherwise it's not gonna work at all
[7436.84 --> 7438.84]  um
[7439.08 --> 7441.08]  Okay, well I
[7441.64 --> 7445.40]  Am sort of at a loss here, so let's just go ahead and do this
[7446.12 --> 7448.04]  All right, bada bing bada boom
[7449.00 --> 7455.64]  So we start with bertha 2.0 which is probably one of the most interesting prodigy builds i've ever seen by dgpc
[7456.20 --> 7458.92]  So so terrible because of the low color depth
[7460.20 --> 7466.04]  It looks really cool. Yeah in person trust us uh go to the forum thread it will be posted in the build loop
[7467.72 --> 7469.08]  Oh
[7469.08 --> 7471.48]  Dang it google docs coming you're killing me here
[7472.44 --> 7474.04]  Oh, here it goes here. It goes here. It goes
[7474.92 --> 7476.12]  All right
[7476.12 --> 7478.36]  Sweet give us one second. He's gonna be able to down
[7478.36 --> 7481.72]  He's gonna be able to open it because all the downloads went all at once
[7482.20 --> 7488.36]  Which is pretty cool sweet from current slide next yes, there we go now. It looks good. So
[7489.24 --> 7494.52]  Handles at the top still usable, but there's a rad mounted on the top. That's gorgeous. I love that
[7494.52 --> 7499.96]  And he didn't have to use like any external loops or anything because he just cut through the top of the case very nice
[7500.20 --> 7505.16]  I've done that before actually it's it works. It's great. Yeah. Yeah, he used a coolance kit though
[7506.92 --> 7508.84]  Would you not have used a coolance? I don't know
[7508.84 --> 7514.36]  It's just it's one of those things where you don't see a really well done build very often that uses coolance
[7515.00 --> 7516.04]  External uh
[7516.04 --> 7521.08]  It looks nice though. It does. No it worked. It worked in this case. Yeah, but it was just
[7521.08 --> 7525.32]  It's just one of those funny things where you don't see that that often. No, you're definitely right just I think it worked
[7525.32 --> 7531.08]  Really well in this because it looks like it's an extension of the case. I love the front grill. That's outstanding. Yep
[7532.52 --> 7536.20]  Again, you can't see other angles because I only do one picture color schemes great
[7536.36 --> 7539.56]  We should probably start doing like two pictures at least two pictures
[7539.56 --> 7543.32]  I've been trying to find a half a medium. I did two pictures once and there was some flag for it, but
[7543.80 --> 7548.44]  Maybe maybe we'll maybe we'll just do two anyways, and then we have metallic acids rog
[7548.44 --> 7553.40]  5 gene TJ 08 dash e by metallic acid and this thing is
[7554.04 --> 7558.04]  Ludicrous freaking incredible like this one you have to go see all the pictures
[7558.44 --> 7563.16]  Because what's crazy about this one is that you see these illuminated
[7563.72 --> 7567.72]  Glowing white pieces here the shroud that's the custom shroud for the graphics card
[7568.20 --> 7570.84]  Sort of some of these other pieces like count down here on the bottom of the case
[7571.08 --> 7577.64]  He's got multi-color leds in there so you can actually change the color scheme of the system, which I think is just so cool
[7577.64 --> 7581.80]  And it works so well with the rest of his color scheme the colors that he has available
[7581.80 --> 7584.12]  Or at least the colors that he's taking pictures of yeah
[7584.28 --> 7590.04]  He got this idea from the sectioned off like not sound card, but sound section of that motherboard
[7590.28 --> 7595.40]  Oh, so from asus's red line concept where they segment off the part of the pcb
[7596.12 --> 7602.04]  That's so he took the red line concept and decided that it looked really good and to apply it to the rest of his build
[7602.04 --> 7607.32]  Which is a really good idea sometimes you need something new when you're modding because everything's been done
[7607.32 --> 7610.60]  And that was a really really good idea to just take
[7611.24 --> 7613.88]  What they did and take it so much further
[7614.52 --> 7615.88]  It's just an amazing place
[7616.60 --> 7620.52]  All right. Well, I think that pretty much wraps it up for the wan show for this week guys
[7620.52 --> 7623.88]  We'll see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[7624.44 --> 7628.84]  Except sometimes not quite the same bat time we do our best and we're very sorry we ran late today
[7629.32 --> 7633.08]  But yeah, thanks again to our special guest jj from asus
[7633.08 --> 7637.64]  I think he was absolutely awesome and the after party will be shortly
[7638.76 --> 7640.76]  We'll be shortly
[7640.76 --> 7642.76]  Whatever, man
[7642.76 --> 7648.92] そう
[7649.08 --> 7650.36]  Step back
