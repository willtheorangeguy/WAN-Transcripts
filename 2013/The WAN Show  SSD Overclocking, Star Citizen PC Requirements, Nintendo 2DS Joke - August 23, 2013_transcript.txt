[0.00 --> 1.12]  Come to work with me.
[1.60 --> 4.30]  Alright guys, welcome to the WAN show.
[4.42 --> 6.12]  We've got a bit of a, uh, wait, what?
[8.66 --> 9.10]  What?
[9.96 --> 10.44]  Nothing.
[11.08 --> 11.74]  Is it my hair?
[12.36 --> 13.28]  Yes. No.
[13.76 --> 16.00]  Okay. Well, welcome to the WAN show, guys.
[16.08 --> 18.04]  We have a fantastic show for you today.
[18.18 --> 20.04]  We're down in Seattle for PAX Prime
[20.04 --> 22.02]  and we're streaming out of a pedophile's basement.
[22.42 --> 24.00]  So, um, you know,
[24.06 --> 26.04]  it makes us feel pretty uncomfortable, but the fact
[26.04 --> 28.36]  that we're not young is really encouraging
[28.36 --> 30.58]  because, I mean, my understanding
[30.58 --> 32.50]  of, of the whole
[32.50 --> 34.46]  pedophile thing is that
[34.46 --> 36.20]  it has to do with, um,
[36.20 --> 37.50]  animals and sock puppets.
[38.14 --> 40.80]  And, uh, we don't own any animals or sock puppets
[40.80 --> 42.56]  because we are adults.
[43.14 --> 43.82]  I have animals.
[45.02 --> 46.08]  And sock puppets.
[46.10 --> 48.08]  And sock puppets. Okay, so this is a problem for me.
[48.34 --> 50.20]  Anyway, but seriously, you guys, uh,
[50.24 --> 52.22]  TimmyTechTV, so youtube.com slash
[52.22 --> 53.54]  TimmyTechTV. Timmy, come on over here.
[53.66 --> 55.94]  Not a pedophile. Not a pedophile.
[56.06 --> 57.18]  Wait, how do I come on over there?
[57.18 --> 58.10]  I can, I can.
[58.10 --> 59.36]  I'll go the way B-roll went.
[59.58 --> 59.86]  All right.
[60.28 --> 60.80]  You should, uh.
[60.92 --> 61.44]  I can come back here.
[61.62 --> 63.00]  Can you put that on your business cards?
[63.42 --> 64.90]  Not, definitely not a pedophile.
[65.02 --> 65.92]  Definitely not a pedophile.
[67.44 --> 68.88]  You know what's funny is Edsel,
[69.10 --> 69.60]  or Diesel,
[69.84 --> 71.54]  so Edsel, Diesel has revealed
[71.54 --> 72.58]  his true name.
[72.68 --> 72.98]  What am I?
[73.40 --> 73.72]  Edsel.
[74.08 --> 74.38]  Edsel?
[74.48 --> 76.22]  Yeah, so Edsel has revealed
[76.22 --> 77.52]  his true name on Twitter.
[77.66 --> 79.28]  So if you want to follow Edsel on Twitter,
[79.44 --> 79.86]  it's, uh,
[79.96 --> 80.86]  at Edsel Iago.
[80.86 --> 81.86]  Um,
[82.38 --> 83.90]  the business card he handed me
[83.90 --> 85.68]  when he came for his first day
[85.68 --> 87.06]  of internship actually said,
[87.14 --> 88.48]  definitely not a serial killer
[88.48 --> 88.98]  on the back.
[89.46 --> 90.02]  And I was like,
[90.16 --> 90.64]  so,
[90.92 --> 91.64]  one murder?
[91.82 --> 92.06]  Two?
[93.06 --> 94.50]  At what point do you cross over
[94.50 --> 95.16]  to serial killer?
[95.24 --> 95.72]  I don't know.
[96.42 --> 96.82]  Anyway,
[97.04 --> 99.34]  so Tim has generously
[99.34 --> 100.84]  allowed us to stay here,
[101.20 --> 101.46]  uh,
[101.46 --> 102.52]  saving me probably around
[102.52 --> 103.46]  $3,000
[103.46 --> 104.68]  on this trip.
[104.68 --> 105.04]  So,
[105.72 --> 106.84]  all I gave him
[106.84 --> 108.10]  was a PAX Prime pass.
[108.62 --> 108.86]  So,
[109.02 --> 109.30]  you know,
[109.38 --> 109.50]  hey,
[109.56 --> 110.28]  I think it worked out
[110.28 --> 111.08]  great for everyone.
[112.08 --> 112.82]  Especially me.
[113.34 --> 113.58]  Um,
[113.58 --> 114.26]  so anyway,
[114.40 --> 114.86]  do you want to just
[114.86 --> 115.46]  pimp your channel
[115.46 --> 116.24]  for a little bit here
[116.24 --> 116.76]  and then we'll,
[116.82 --> 117.82]  we'll get on with the show?
[118.48 --> 118.66]  So,
[118.86 --> 119.74]  obviously guys,
[119.82 --> 120.08]  uh,
[120.24 --> 121.02]  I'm no Linus,
[121.12 --> 121.34]  but,
[121.54 --> 123.18]  I do some
[123.18 --> 124.46]  YouTube unboxings
[124.46 --> 125.78]  and random videos
[125.78 --> 126.68]  of things that,
[127.08 --> 127.26]  you know,
[127.30 --> 128.38]  hopefully other people don't.
[128.98 --> 129.72]  YouTube.com
[129.72 --> 130.20]  slash
[130.20 --> 131.18]  TimmyTechTV.
[131.80 --> 132.44]  Check it out.
[132.88 --> 133.16]  Uh,
[133.64 --> 134.48]  subscribe.
[134.92 --> 135.12]  Yeah,
[135.22 --> 135.76]  do subscribe.
[136.14 --> 136.46]  Subscribe.
[136.74 --> 137.26]  Do subscribe.
[137.62 --> 138.02]  Or,
[138.22 --> 139.02]  you could hold out
[139.02 --> 140.30]  until he does another giveaway
[140.30 --> 141.04]  through our channel
[141.04 --> 142.04]  and you could subscribe now.
[142.46 --> 142.62]  Yeah.
[142.74 --> 143.60]  Or you could subscribe now.
[143.68 --> 144.14]  Go do it now.
[144.62 --> 145.06]  Alright,
[145.22 --> 145.52]  so guys,
[145.58 --> 146.78]  we've got some great topics
[146.78 --> 147.38]  for you today.
[147.90 --> 149.30]  The Star Citizen requirements
[149.30 --> 150.80]  look freaking awesome.
[151.10 --> 151.34]  So good.
[151.50 --> 151.74]  Like,
[151.86 --> 152.28]  this is,
[152.42 --> 153.78]  we haven't seen this since,
[154.82 --> 155.88]  I don't know,
[155.98 --> 156.60]  like a title?
[156.74 --> 157.50]  Crisis One,
[157.58 --> 157.96]  I think.
[158.50 --> 159.66]  Where they basically came out
[159.66 --> 160.04]  and said,
[160.20 --> 161.12]  nothing will run this.
[161.18 --> 162.06]  So calm down.
[162.20 --> 162.22]  Well,
[162.22 --> 162.94]  it used to be fairly consistent.
[163.22 --> 164.30]  When you went to go buy a new game,
[164.30 --> 165.20]  you'd flip it over
[165.20 --> 166.20]  and read the citizen requirements
[166.20 --> 167.02]  because you had to.
[167.52 --> 167.80]  Um,
[167.94 --> 170.06]  Nvidia may release a GTX 790.
[170.18 --> 170.80]  We don't know.
[171.08 --> 171.68]  More rumors.
[171.90 --> 172.58]  More rumors.
[172.96 --> 173.10]  Uh,
[173.10 --> 174.06]  Battlefield 4
[174.06 --> 174.88]  is apparently going to run
[174.88 --> 176.34]  at 720p on PS4.
[176.74 --> 177.18]  Whoa.
[177.54 --> 178.18]  Big surprise.
[178.18 --> 180.16]  so you can run it in the 720p-ness.
[180.30 --> 180.66]  Whoa.
[180.66 --> 181.06]  Whoa.
[184.06 --> 186.30]  Enjoy all that 720p-ness.
[187.92 --> 188.18]  I mean,
[188.58 --> 189.34]  those console guys,
[189.42 --> 189.94]  they eat it up.
[190.40 --> 191.56]  That 720p-ness.
[191.68 --> 193.46]  We're running 1080p plus penises?
[193.98 --> 194.42]  Um,
[194.62 --> 194.82]  yeah,
[194.90 --> 196.28]  1080p plus...
[196.28 --> 196.68]  Penis.
[196.86 --> 197.20]  ...ness.
[197.38 --> 197.64]  No,
[197.76 --> 198.84]  there's no penis in it
[198.84 --> 199.46]  after that point.
[199.56 --> 199.84]  Why?
[200.02 --> 200.64]  Why are you gonna,
[200.70 --> 201.80]  why are you gonna bring penises
[201.80 --> 202.30]  into everything?
[202.30 --> 203.02]  So,
[203.20 --> 204.34]  SSD overclocking
[204.34 --> 205.18]  could be a thing
[205.18 --> 207.28]  on upcoming Intel SSDs.
[207.34 --> 208.42]  That's the sort of word
[208.42 --> 208.96]  on the street.
[208.96 --> 209.18]  We'll just jump into that one
[209.18 --> 209.70]  right away.
[209.92 --> 210.22]  No,
[210.40 --> 211.50]  we're not doing that right away
[211.50 --> 212.54]  because first,
[212.70 --> 213.58]  we are gonna run
[213.58 --> 215.04]  the intro.
[215.04 --> 216.04]  Oh, okay.
[232.30 --> 241.56]  Whoa,
[241.70 --> 242.26]  what's that?
[242.34 --> 243.48]  That's actually the,
[243.54 --> 243.76]  uh,
[243.76 --> 243.94]  oh,
[244.02 --> 244.26]  okay,
[244.36 --> 244.48]  well,
[244.48 --> 245.34]  that's not necessarily
[245.34 --> 246.14]  the correct,
[246.20 --> 246.54]  uh,
[247.02 --> 248.22]  ad integration right there,
[248.30 --> 249.48]  so we'll have to probably
[249.48 --> 250.24]  show you that again.
[250.30 --> 250.56]  Anyway,
[250.80 --> 252.46]  our sponsor for today
[252.46 --> 253.62]  is Hotspot Shield,
[253.80 --> 256.50]  so they have millions of users.
[256.84 --> 257.42]  They have,
[257.56 --> 257.82]  uh,
[257.82 --> 259.22]  basically it's a VPN system
[259.22 --> 260.28]  that works on your desktop
[260.28 --> 261.70]  or it works on your mobile phone
[261.70 --> 262.26]  or your iPad
[262.26 --> 263.00]  or whatever else
[263.00 --> 263.78]  the case may be.
[264.10 --> 265.56]  It's useful for all kinds of things,
[265.64 --> 266.72]  whether it's circumventing
[266.72 --> 267.60]  regional restrictions
[267.60 --> 269.80]  for websites that,
[269.98 --> 270.10]  say,
[270.14 --> 270.52]  for example,
[270.52 --> 271.20]  stream video
[271.20 --> 272.70]  and are US only
[272.70 --> 274.80]  or for masking your IP
[274.80 --> 276.16]  from people who you don't
[276.16 --> 277.00]  want to have it.
[277.12 --> 277.36]  I mean,
[277.76 --> 278.10]  that,
[278.20 --> 278.48]  uh,
[278.52 --> 278.72]  you know,
[278.78 --> 279.84]  that masking IP-ness
[279.84 --> 281.06]  is definitely a big thing
[281.06 --> 282.96]  and I wonder,
[283.08 --> 283.98]  is it okay to say that
[283.98 --> 285.08]  during a sponsorship spot?
[285.14 --> 285.56]  I don't know,
[285.64 --> 285.92]  but anyway,
[285.96 --> 286.66]  we're gonna tell you more
[286.66 --> 287.84]  about it later on in the show.
[288.02 --> 288.68]  For now,
[288.76 --> 289.82]  let's jump into the topic
[289.82 --> 291.12]  that Slick really wants
[291.12 --> 291.62]  to get into
[291.70 --> 292.62]  for some reason
[292.62 --> 294.56]  and I'm not really quite sure why
[294.56 --> 295.48]  so I'm gonna have to scroll
[295.48 --> 296.24]  all the way down
[296.24 --> 296.78]  because apparently
[296.78 --> 297.88]  he put the,
[298.00 --> 298.18]  ah,
[298.26 --> 298.48]  yes,
[298.54 --> 298.98]  here we go.
[299.20 --> 299.94]  So this was posted
[299.94 --> 301.24]  on the Linus Tech Tips forum.
[301.36 --> 302.58]  I'm gonna let you introduce it
[302.58 --> 303.86]  since apparently this is,
[304.10 --> 304.32]  uh-oh,
[304.72 --> 305.68]  you have got to be kidding me.
[305.72 --> 306.62]  This was working before.
[307.20 --> 307.48]  So,
[307.58 --> 307.84]  uh,
[307.90 --> 308.14]  yeah,
[308.18 --> 308.80]  we're gonna go ahead
[308.80 --> 309.82]  and we're gonna unplug that
[309.82 --> 312.12]  and then plug that back in
[312.12 --> 313.10]  and we're gonna hope
[313.10 --> 313.86]  that this works
[313.86 --> 316.18]  because,
[316.32 --> 316.84]  uh-oh,
[316.84 --> 318.00]  so far,
[318.68 --> 319.24]  so far,
[319.36 --> 320.04]  things have gone
[320.04 --> 321.58]  not too badly today.
[322.32 --> 322.72]  Well,
[322.78 --> 323.02]  actually,
[323.10 --> 324.12]  they've gone terribly today.
[324.22 --> 324.50]  In fact,
[324.56 --> 326.00]  that could be a whole WAN show.
[326.12 --> 326.74]  Not very many things
[326.74 --> 327.44]  have gone well today.
[327.54 --> 328.34]  In and of itself,
[328.44 --> 328.66]  yeah,
[328.76 --> 330.24]  between your audio issues
[330.24 --> 332.12]  and our battery
[332.12 --> 332.94]  for that camera
[332.94 --> 333.62]  that ended up
[333.62 --> 335.00]  not working with it at all
[335.00 --> 335.76]  in spite of the fact
[335.76 --> 338.02]  that they're socket compatible.
[338.18 --> 338.94]  Just tweet everything out.
[338.96 --> 339.68]  Just tweet the articles.
[339.68 --> 340.22]  Go crazy.
[340.82 --> 341.08]  Okay,
[341.24 --> 341.72]  because,
[341.80 --> 341.98]  uh,
[342.00 --> 342.18]  this,
[342.26 --> 342.48]  this,
[342.56 --> 342.76]  uh,
[342.76 --> 343.02]  this,
[343.06 --> 343.26]  uh,
[343.26 --> 344.74]  this here should work right now.
[344.88 --> 345.16]  This was,
[345.18 --> 345.58]  this was,
[345.64 --> 346.30]  this was working,
[346.42 --> 346.56]  like,
[346.64 --> 347.30]  a minute ago.
[347.90 --> 348.30]  So,
[348.46 --> 348.78]  uh,
[348.82 --> 349.46]  you know what?
[349.84 --> 350.88]  If I do this,
[351.42 --> 352.20]  there is a chance
[352.20 --> 352.80]  that it will just
[352.80 --> 353.48]  brick the whole thing.
[353.54 --> 353.62]  So,
[353.70 --> 354.68]  we're gonna tweet the articles,
[354.84 --> 354.96]  guys.
[355.14 --> 355.50]  So,
[355.58 --> 356.48]  if you're following on,
[356.68 --> 356.96]  uh,
[356.96 --> 358.26]  if you're following me on
[358.26 --> 360.16]  at Linus Tech on Twitter,
[360.64 --> 362.44]  Intel CPUs can overclock,
[362.56 --> 364.30]  but so can their SSDs.
[364.42 --> 364.80]  So,
[364.86 --> 366.34]  this was submitted on the forum.
[366.50 --> 367.00]  Here we go.
[367.14 --> 367.74]  Tweeting.
[367.74 --> 370.26]  Uh,
[370.50 --> 371.04]  by
[371.04 --> 374.20]  Guas 5373.
[374.28 --> 374.38]  So,
[374.44 --> 375.14]  the original articles
[375.14 --> 376.26]  from Tech Power Up.
[376.66 --> 377.10]  And,
[377.20 --> 377.78]  basically,
[378.06 --> 379.14]  I think this is the most
[379.14 --> 380.42]  insane thing ever.
[380.54 --> 380.64]  So,
[380.66 --> 381.82]  it could soon become possible
[381.82 --> 383.10]  to overclock the controller
[383.10 --> 384.84]  and NAND flash on your SSD
[384.84 --> 386.32]  if Intel has its way.
[386.54 --> 388.06]  The company is set to demonstrate
[388.06 --> 390.22]  how to overclock Intel branded SSDs
[390.22 --> 391.92]  using its extreme tuning utility
[391.92 --> 393.18]  at IDF 2013,
[393.62 --> 394.86]  which is gonna be in September.
[395.66 --> 396.10]  Um,
[397.16 --> 397.50]  okay.
[397.98 --> 398.22]  Let's,
[398.38 --> 398.58]  let's,
[398.68 --> 399.90]  so basically what they're saying
[399.90 --> 400.74]  is it's gonna be just like
[400.74 --> 401.72]  any other overclocking
[401.72 --> 402.22]  where you're gonna get
[402.22 --> 403.16]  a performance benefit,
[403.40 --> 404.82]  but there will also be
[404.82 --> 405.40]  tech,
[405.68 --> 406.80]  potentially,
[407.30 --> 407.56]  uh,
[407.56 --> 409.54]  reliability issues as well.
[409.78 --> 410.06]  Stability.
[410.38 --> 411.22]  Stability issues.
[411.38 --> 411.58]  So,
[411.72 --> 412.02]  uh,
[412.06 --> 413.52]  560 megabytes per second
[413.52 --> 414.36]  seems to be the practical
[414.36 --> 415.04]  maximum bandwidth
[415.04 --> 416.72]  say the 6 gigabit per second
[416.72 --> 418.10]  SSDs have been able to achieve.
[418.30 --> 419.04]  It can always be handy
[419.04 --> 419.70]  getting your SSD
[419.70 --> 420.68]  a few dozen more megabytes
[420.68 --> 421.72]  per second sequential speed
[421.72 --> 422.56]  at the expense of stability.
[422.70 --> 423.28]  That's insane.
[424.00 --> 425.62]  But you run 8 SSDs.
[425.62 --> 426.26]  I run 8 SSDs.
[426.26 --> 427.28]  It's already suicide.
[427.28 --> 427.52]  Okay.
[427.52 --> 428.26]  Why do you care?
[428.32 --> 430.18]  I run 8 SSDs in RAID 0
[430.18 --> 431.30]  that haven't been,
[431.30 --> 431.66]  which is suicide.
[431.74 --> 433.12]  that haven't been overclocked
[433.12 --> 434.04]  to be unstable.
[434.04 --> 435.58]  So while they could die,
[435.58 --> 437.24]  and while I am
[437.24 --> 438.36]  multiplying
[438.36 --> 440.48]  the chances of data failure
[440.48 --> 441.32]  by,
[441.82 --> 442.34]  um,
[442.42 --> 442.60]  well,
[442.66 --> 443.14]  a lot.
[443.78 --> 444.84]  It's a ton.
[445.12 --> 445.44]  Okay,
[445.54 --> 446.28]  because it actually,
[446.40 --> 446.58]  like,
[446.62 --> 447.20]  the way it works
[447.20 --> 448.14]  is you actually have to
[448.14 --> 448.86]  multiply
[448.86 --> 450.38]  the chance of failure.
[450.48 --> 450.52]  Because you're adding,
[450.52 --> 450.54]  like,
[450.54 --> 451.66]  failure rate every time.
[451.66 --> 451.92]  Yes.
[452.14 --> 452.26]  So,
[452.42 --> 452.62]  but,
[452.82 --> 454.30]  but hold on a second,
[454.68 --> 455.90]  because at least
[455.90 --> 457.60]  those SSDs are known good.
[458.04 --> 459.00]  At least they're stable.
[459.40 --> 460.52]  So if someone takes 2
[460.52 --> 461.54]  and overclocks them,
[461.58 --> 462.28]  you'd think that's insane.
[462.34 --> 463.26]  But if someone takes 8
[463.26 --> 464.18]  and doesn't overclock them,
[464.24 --> 465.08]  you don't think that's insane.
[465.08 --> 465.32]  Yeah,
[465.48 --> 466.64]  because when you overclock,
[466.84 --> 468.16]  when you overclock them,
[468.44 --> 470.08]  they're running outside of spec.
[470.34 --> 471.42]  We already know
[471.42 --> 472.28]  that on a CPU,
[472.76 --> 473.74]  even if you,
[473.88 --> 474.02]  okay,
[474.40 --> 475.04]  CPU,
[475.28 --> 475.94]  perfect example.
[476.44 --> 476.74]  So,
[476.74 --> 479.54]  when you dial in an overclock,
[480.20 --> 481.10]  you dial it in
[481.10 --> 481.94]  and you leave it
[481.94 --> 482.80]  pretty much forever.
[483.14 --> 483.60]  Am I right?
[484.34 --> 484.62]  Okay,
[484.90 --> 486.16]  so we already know
[486.16 --> 486.94]  that
[486.94 --> 488.88]  when you dial in your overclock
[488.88 --> 489.64]  on your SSD,
[489.90 --> 490.60]  you're going to do it
[490.60 --> 492.12]  while there's no critical data on it.
[492.38 --> 492.64]  Correct?
[493.60 --> 494.62]  In this situation,
[494.62 --> 495.70]  if you're overclocking SSDs,
[495.72 --> 496.12]  you're not going to put
[496.12 --> 496.94]  critical data on it.
[497.08 --> 498.08]  So your concept
[498.08 --> 499.14]  is you would put,
[500.04 --> 501.48]  so you would just take the risk
[501.48 --> 502.82]  that your OS would just break.
[503.14 --> 503.34]  Yeah.
[503.60 --> 503.96]  Because,
[504.10 --> 504.20]  okay,
[504.36 --> 504.48]  look,
[504.60 --> 506.02]  CPUs,
[506.16 --> 507.16]  the max overclock they can achieve.
[507.16 --> 507.68]  What critical data
[507.68 --> 509.10]  do you carry on your SSDs?
[509.10 --> 509.36]  None.
[509.48 --> 509.88]  Exactly.
[510.04 --> 510.76]  I have a home,
[510.90 --> 512.10]  I have a 16 terabyte server.
[512.10 --> 513.66]  Most people have storage drives.
[514.50 --> 514.90]  Okay,
[515.14 --> 515.62]  but do you?
[515.64 --> 516.32]  If they're going to run
[516.32 --> 517.62]  RAID 0 SSDs,
[517.62 --> 517.94]  hold on.
[517.96 --> 518.68]  they probably have storage.
[518.68 --> 519.30]  Save games.
[519.72 --> 521.36]  Do you have all your save games
[521.36 --> 522.48]  mapped somewhere else?
[522.58 --> 522.98]  Yes.
[522.98 --> 523.34]  Okay,
[523.44 --> 523.60]  does,
[523.96 --> 525.56]  is average consumer
[525.56 --> 526.40]  able to do that?
[526.48 --> 527.56]  If they're running a storage drive,
[527.60 --> 528.66]  that's the easiest thing on the planet.
[528.68 --> 529.40]  Let's even say,
[529.52 --> 530.42]  not necessarily,
[530.66 --> 531.84]  some games map your save,
[531.92 --> 532.12]  like,
[532.54 --> 533.70]  freaking all over the place.
[534.06 --> 534.20]  Like,
[534.26 --> 534.92]  it's a nightmare.
[535.32 --> 536.70]  Steam doesn't remap most of them.
[536.76 --> 536.94]  No,
[537.02 --> 537.24]  it doesn't.
[537.26 --> 538.44]  It is usually going to documents.
[538.90 --> 539.30]  Usually.
[539.76 --> 540.24]  Almost always.
[540.24 --> 541.22]  Except when they don't.
[541.30 --> 541.90]  Almost always.
[541.90 --> 542.96]  Except when you go play
[542.96 --> 544.06]  that old retro game
[544.06 --> 545.44]  that you really wanted to play,
[545.44 --> 546.52]  and it goes and puts it
[546.52 --> 547.82]  in the program files folder,
[547.82 --> 549.68]  which is in the Steam docs.
[549.70 --> 551.32]  And then your SSD overclock
[551.32 --> 552.14]  becomes unstable,
[552.28 --> 552.86]  and you lose it,
[552.94 --> 553.68]  and now you have to play
[553.68 --> 554.34]  that old game
[554.34 --> 555.26]  that you wanted to play
[555.26 --> 556.54]  over again
[556.54 --> 557.58]  just to get to the point
[557.58 --> 559.04]  where you were left off.
[559.12 --> 559.22]  Like,
[559.34 --> 560.30]  I think it's insane.
[561.46 --> 562.74]  You don't mess around
[562.74 --> 563.22]  with storage.
[563.46 --> 564.72]  I install old games
[564.72 --> 565.90]  on my storage drives anyways.
[566.90 --> 567.10]  It's,
[567.20 --> 567.56]  not,
[567.66 --> 568.50]  that's not the point.
[568.66 --> 568.82]  Okay,
[569.28 --> 570.74]  the average overclocker,
[570.80 --> 571.20]  look at the,
[571.24 --> 571.90]  look at the level
[571.90 --> 572.86]  to which overclocking
[572.86 --> 573.58]  has been dumbed down
[573.58 --> 574.14]  at this point.
[574.14 --> 575.18]  You press the button
[575.18 --> 575.90]  and it overclocks
[575.90 --> 576.40]  your computer.
[576.88 --> 577.94]  Just because someone
[577.94 --> 579.60]  is comfortable overclocking
[579.60 --> 580.54]  doesn't mean they should
[580.54 --> 581.36]  be overclocking
[581.36 --> 581.84]  their storage.
[581.86 --> 582.36]  I don't think everyone
[582.36 --> 583.06]  should do this.
[583.66 --> 583.88]  No.
[583.88 --> 584.90]  I don't think it's a bad thing.
[584.90 --> 585.78]  I don't think anyone
[585.78 --> 586.46]  should do this.
[586.64 --> 587.26]  Would you overclock
[587.26 --> 588.08]  your SATA controller?
[588.86 --> 589.46]  It'll be,
[589.72 --> 590.60]  I think it'd be fun.
[590.76 --> 591.46]  I think it'd be interesting.
[591.82 --> 592.62]  It'd be interesting
[592.62 --> 593.16]  to just,
[593.64 --> 593.98]  because,
[594.18 --> 594.42]  okay,
[594.54 --> 594.80]  remember,
[595.24 --> 596.30]  you have worked
[596.30 --> 597.88]  with some crazy errors.
[598.18 --> 598.44]  Like,
[598.52 --> 599.40]  that stream machine?
[599.92 --> 600.36]  Okay,
[600.82 --> 602.34]  that's the kind of
[602.34 --> 602.86]  bullshit
[602.86 --> 604.02]  that happens
[604.02 --> 605.18]  when you have
[605.18 --> 608.34]  unstable storage.
[608.46 --> 608.78]  But the people
[608.78 --> 609.58]  that are overclocking
[609.58 --> 610.50]  every single thing
[610.50 --> 611.66]  inside their entire computer?
[611.90 --> 612.68]  It'll be impossible
[612.68 --> 613.64]  to diagnose anything.
[614.06 --> 614.86]  Because their RAM
[614.86 --> 615.56]  will be overclocked,
[615.58 --> 616.50]  their CPU will be overclocked,
[616.54 --> 617.56]  their SSD will be overclocked,
[617.56 --> 618.20]  and you'll never know
[618.20 --> 618.94]  where the error came from.
[618.96 --> 619.46]  But those are the people
[619.46 --> 620.40]  that don't care
[620.40 --> 621.32]  and want to tinker
[621.32 --> 622.02]  with their computers
[622.02 --> 622.82]  and are expecting problems.
[622.82 --> 623.58]  They want their computer
[623.58 --> 624.12]  to be broken,
[624.56 --> 624.92]  basically.
[625.08 --> 625.82]  They're expecting problems.
[625.86 --> 627.28]  I wouldn't overclock storage
[627.28 --> 628.82]  on anything that wasn't,
[629.72 --> 629.86]  no,
[629.92 --> 630.50]  I just wouldn't do it.
[630.58 --> 631.28]  It's insane.
[632.20 --> 633.58]  I find this very surprising
[633.58 --> 634.04]  for the man
[634.04 --> 635.10]  that runs eight SSDs.
[635.62 --> 637.34]  Eight stable SSDs
[637.34 --> 637.82]  that work.
[639.02 --> 639.72]  I don't think
[639.72 --> 640.32]  it's going to throw them
[640.32 --> 640.90]  that unstable.
[641.50 --> 641.78]  Okay,
[641.86 --> 642.64]  you know what?
[642.90 --> 643.80]  Speaking of unstable,
[644.30 --> 645.20]  Star Citizen hardware
[645.20 --> 645.86]  requirements
[645.86 --> 646.98]  separate the men
[646.98 --> 647.94]  from the boys.
[648.06 --> 648.94]  Why is this unstable?
[649.38 --> 650.12]  It's not unstable.
[650.30 --> 651.00]  How is that a segue?
[651.46 --> 652.30]  Because I don't want
[652.30 --> 653.26]  to talk about that anymore.
[653.94 --> 655.12]  I should bring Josh in here.
[655.66 --> 656.72]  He doesn't want to talk about something,
[656.82 --> 657.78]  he just changes the subject.
[657.78 --> 659.72]  All right,
[659.74 --> 660.60]  I'm tweeting this out.
[662.72 --> 663.68]  If I remember quickly,
[663.76 --> 664.48]  it's like eight gigs
[664.48 --> 665.18]  of system RAM.
[665.34 --> 666.12]  So this was posted
[666.12 --> 667.42]  on the forum by,
[667.56 --> 668.72]  I gotta look this up,
[669.18 --> 669.66]  Lucio.
[670.70 --> 671.34]  So anyway,
[671.84 --> 672.90]  directly translated
[672.90 --> 674.00]  from Google Translate,
[674.10 --> 674.76]  this is awesome.
[675.02 --> 675.84]  So get this,
[675.92 --> 676.04]  guys,
[676.04 --> 677.10]  eight gigs of RAM
[677.10 --> 678.00]  and 64-bit
[678.00 --> 678.54]  are a minimum.
[679.28 --> 679.80]  Bye-bye,
[679.96 --> 680.70]  32-bit.
[681.04 --> 681.78]  Bye-bye.
[681.94 --> 682.40]  And you know what?
[682.42 --> 683.00]  Good riddance, too,
[683.06 --> 684.48]  because I don't see
[684.48 --> 685.04]  any reason
[685.04 --> 686.06]  why the game
[686.06 --> 687.16]  should be designed
[687.16 --> 688.60]  to only have to use
[688.60 --> 689.24]  enough memory
[689.24 --> 689.94]  so that it can run
[689.94 --> 690.32]  on 32-bit.
[690.34 --> 690.64]  You know what?
[690.68 --> 691.44]  No, forget it.
[691.78 --> 692.50]  64-bit,
[692.72 --> 694.44]  we've had three iterations
[694.44 --> 695.56]  of Windows OSes,
[695.60 --> 696.42]  and if we want to talk
[696.42 --> 697.76]  OSes that aren't Windows,
[697.86 --> 698.46]  it's been going on
[698.46 --> 699.20]  longer than that,
[699.84 --> 701.00]  that are 64-bit,
[701.22 --> 701.98]  and the processors
[701.98 --> 702.32]  have been around.
[702.38 --> 702.50]  I mean,
[703.08 --> 704.32]  any processor
[704.32 --> 704.86]  that's capable
[704.86 --> 705.72]  of running Star Citizen
[705.72 --> 706.98]  supports 64-bit.
[707.06 --> 707.42]  So if you were
[707.42 --> 708.06]  one of those people
[708.06 --> 708.90]  who bought
[708.90 --> 710.68]  Windows 7 32-bit,
[712.18 --> 712.46]  like,
[712.46 --> 713.60]  sorry, dude.
[714.24 --> 715.18]  I was at a booth today,
[715.42 --> 716.40]  this won't take long,
[716.46 --> 717.16]  I was at a booth today,
[717.48 --> 718.38]  and I did my little intro
[718.38 --> 719.06]  explaining how we're
[719.06 --> 719.66]  hardware viewers
[719.66 --> 720.24]  trying to get into
[720.24 --> 720.78]  the game stuff,
[720.88 --> 721.68]  all that blah-blah-blah-blah,
[721.76 --> 722.24]  and he's like,
[722.26 --> 723.02]  oh, you'll love this,
[723.26 --> 723.90]  we made our game
[723.90 --> 725.04]  so it can work on everything.
[725.26 --> 725.60]  I was like,
[725.82 --> 726.66]  uh...
[726.66 --> 729.84]  Did you slap him?
[730.10 --> 730.76]  I was like,
[730.92 --> 731.24]  uh,
[731.52 --> 732.26]  we'll just talk
[732.26 --> 732.74]  about the game.
[733.08 --> 733.82]  Let's just talk
[733.82 --> 734.32]  about the game.
[734.82 --> 735.32]  So anyway,
[735.46 --> 736.32]  8 gigs of RAM minimum,
[736.32 --> 737.10]  now get this,
[737.58 --> 738.72]  for optimal settings,
[738.84 --> 739.74]  you'll need a high-end PC
[739.74 --> 740.62]  with the technology
[740.62 --> 741.72]  in 1.5 years.
[741.72 --> 742.66]  Love it.
[742.94 --> 743.80]  We haven't seen this
[743.80 --> 744.50]  since Crisis,
[744.90 --> 745.78]  where they basically
[745.78 --> 746.36]  came out,
[746.56 --> 747.22]  or Far Cry,
[747.54 --> 748.68]  I mean Far Cry 1
[748.68 --> 749.64]  was a great example
[749.64 --> 750.08]  of this.
[750.36 --> 751.86]  If you had a 9800 Pro
[751.86 --> 753.88]  or X1800 XT
[753.88 --> 754.44]  or whatever was
[754.44 --> 755.12]  the high-end card
[755.12 --> 755.64]  at the time,
[756.04 --> 756.90]  Far Cry was like,
[757.26 --> 757.66]  yeah,
[758.00 --> 758.92]  we don't care,
[759.06 --> 759.30]  yeah,
[759.34 --> 760.04]  we don't care,
[760.14 --> 761.36]  because whatever,
[761.94 --> 762.72]  because we don't care.
[762.86 --> 763.46]  That's awesome.
[763.46 --> 764.54]  I love it,
[764.80 --> 766.82]  because how much fun is,
[766.90 --> 767.70]  because you know what,
[767.76 --> 768.28]  the temptation,
[769.02 --> 769.22]  okay,
[769.48 --> 769.94]  here,
[770.22 --> 770.82]  something you would
[770.82 --> 771.72]  never have the discipline
[771.72 --> 772.74]  to do would be
[772.74 --> 773.72]  to play through a game
[773.72 --> 775.26]  at like low details
[775.26 --> 776.72]  and then go back
[776.72 --> 777.88]  and experience it again
[777.88 --> 778.88]  two years later
[778.88 --> 780.18]  with everything maxed.
[780.28 --> 781.20]  If you could max it now,
[781.26 --> 782.02]  you'd max it now.
[782.52 --> 783.58]  I think it improves
[783.58 --> 784.32]  replayability
[784.32 --> 785.76]  to have the game
[785.76 --> 787.12]  continue to look better.
[787.38 --> 787.86]  I've done that.
[788.32 --> 788.96]  I've done it.
[788.96 --> 789.42]  I've done that,
[789.48 --> 789.62]  yeah.
[789.74 --> 790.82]  I've absolutely done it.
[791.26 --> 791.62]  I mean,
[791.76 --> 792.74]  I couldn't run
[792.74 --> 794.00]  Half-Life 2
[794.00 --> 794.56]  at max settings
[794.56 --> 795.36]  when I first played it.
[795.64 --> 796.76]  I can't remember what game,
[796.80 --> 797.62]  but I know I've done it
[797.62 --> 798.34]  at least once.
[798.74 --> 800.06]  So I think it's outstanding.
[800.24 --> 800.96]  So they're saying
[800.96 --> 802.84]  something along,
[802.98 --> 803.20]  okay,
[803.28 --> 804.48]  so it'll run fluently
[804.48 --> 805.24]  with maybe a future
[805.24 --> 806.88]  GTX 880 or 890,
[807.48 --> 808.52]  and they're saying
[808.52 --> 810.66]  something like a GTX 770
[810.66 --> 811.64]  would be expected
[811.64 --> 812.20]  to be adequate
[812.20 --> 813.84]  for only medium settings.
[814.18 --> 815.22]  So a last generation
[815.22 --> 816.22]  top tier card
[816.22 --> 816.92]  like a 680,
[817.04 --> 817.92]  which is about equivalent,
[818.96 --> 819.40]  medium.
[821.04 --> 822.06]  Go Chris Roberts.
[822.46 --> 823.50]  You're awesome, man.
[823.76 --> 824.34]  That's so cool.
[824.42 --> 825.44]  You and everything
[825.44 --> 826.48]  that happens
[826.48 --> 827.94]  that's anything to do
[827.94 --> 829.06]  with you and all that.
[830.08 --> 830.62]  All right.
[830.96 --> 832.34]  So our next article,
[832.44 --> 832.98]  we're trying to burn
[832.98 --> 833.46]  through these
[833.46 --> 834.36]  because Slick's got to
[834.36 --> 835.32]  get to the BYOC
[835.32 --> 836.54]  and I got to drive him there,
[836.68 --> 837.04]  so...
[837.04 --> 837.52]  It's going to get me
[837.52 --> 838.50]  to the last 10 minutes.
[838.70 --> 839.00]  Yeah.
[839.18 --> 839.64]  Wait, what?
[839.72 --> 840.54]  They kick you out after?
[840.80 --> 841.56]  At 12, yeah.
[842.22 --> 843.10]  It's not all night?
[843.32 --> 843.62]  No.
[844.10 --> 845.02]  Oh, I assumed
[845.02 --> 846.00]  that it was like
[846.00 --> 847.06]  you just couldn't get in and out.
[847.18 --> 848.02]  It's a convention center.
[848.02 --> 848.78]  They can't have people
[848.78 --> 849.14]  over it.
[849.70 --> 850.44]  Oh, well,
[850.64 --> 851.36]  that's unfortunate.
[851.54 --> 852.02]  I'm sorry.
[852.26 --> 852.62]  It's okay.
[853.08 --> 853.30]  Oh.
[853.82 --> 854.26]  Okay.
[854.52 --> 856.04]  So I'm tweeting this article.
[856.66 --> 857.94]  Yeah, I totally misunderstood
[857.94 --> 858.78]  how that worked.
[858.84 --> 859.82]  I thought we were going to, like,
[860.26 --> 861.78]  squeeze you under the door
[861.78 --> 863.04]  Indiana Jones style,
[863.30 --> 865.10]  and that was going to go
[865.10 --> 865.56]  really well.
[865.56 --> 867.64]  So The Verge
[867.64 --> 869.22]  published an article,
[869.42 --> 871.18]  Google blocks Chromecast app
[871.18 --> 871.90]  that lets you stream
[871.90 --> 872.68]  your own videos,
[872.86 --> 873.56]  and there's an update.
[873.66 --> 874.80]  Now, I'll let you cover this one
[874.80 --> 875.32]  because you...
[875.32 --> 875.92]  So basically,
[876.18 --> 877.18]  everyone freaked out
[877.18 --> 879.12]  because Google Chrome,
[879.42 --> 880.22]  or not Google Chrome,
[880.30 --> 881.30]  Chromecast was not
[881.30 --> 882.24]  allowing people to stream
[882.24 --> 883.16]  their own local content.
[883.28 --> 883.86]  Let's see if he can keep
[883.86 --> 884.36]  his train of thought
[884.36 --> 885.36]  if I do this the whole time.
[885.56 --> 886.78]  It was absolutely ridiculous,
[887.24 --> 888.52]  and then Google comes out
[888.52 --> 888.94]  and is like,
[889.10 --> 889.68]  actually,
[889.84 --> 891.52]  it's just not working yet,
[891.64 --> 892.50]  so we're blocking it
[892.50 --> 893.34]  because it's super buggy,
[893.34 --> 894.76]  but it'll be available later,
[895.28 --> 898.34]  which is kind of like...
[899.72 --> 901.90]  It goes to show you,
[902.12 --> 902.40]  like,
[902.76 --> 904.14]  here's the problem
[904.14 --> 904.82]  with the way
[904.82 --> 906.04]  that the media works right now,
[906.10 --> 906.62]  and you know what?
[906.68 --> 907.76]  We're as guilty of it
[907.76 --> 908.60]  as I think
[908.60 --> 909.88]  almost anyone out there.
[909.90 --> 910.28]  We've done it
[910.28 --> 911.24]  with at least one or two things.
[911.30 --> 911.70]  We've done it
[911.70 --> 912.72]  with at least one or two things,
[912.76 --> 913.34]  and the problem
[913.34 --> 915.40]  is that there's not
[915.40 --> 916.98]  many actual sources
[916.98 --> 917.80]  of information
[917.80 --> 919.52]  because so much of it
[919.52 --> 920.70]  is coming from social
[920.70 --> 922.50]  or coming from
[922.50 --> 924.28]  sort of like a few
[924.28 --> 925.68]  sort of...
[925.68 --> 926.24]  I don't know.
[926.34 --> 926.92]  Are they trustworthy?
[927.24 --> 927.78]  Are they not?
[927.86 --> 928.00]  Like,
[928.04 --> 929.06]  there's not much actual
[929.06 --> 930.72]  investigative journalism
[930.72 --> 932.00]  being done these days,
[932.10 --> 934.12]  but there's an awful lot
[934.12 --> 938.34]  of content gatherers.
[938.70 --> 939.62]  So sites like Reddit
[939.62 --> 941.98]  are great for spreading things,
[942.06 --> 943.78]  but they don't really generate much,
[944.06 --> 944.86]  and that's not to say
[944.86 --> 945.96]  Reddit doesn't generate anything,
[946.40 --> 946.90]  but again,
[946.96 --> 947.84]  it's user-generated.
[947.84 --> 949.56]  So the problem is that
[949.56 --> 951.16]  when something gets reported,
[951.16 --> 953.26]  often very little fact-checking
[953.26 --> 953.74]  is done,
[953.88 --> 955.04]  and it just goes
[955.04 --> 956.08]  everywhere.
[956.46 --> 956.66]  Explodes.
[957.12 --> 958.10]  So everyone thought
[958.10 --> 959.12]  this was a big thing,
[959.18 --> 959.72]  and they're all trying to
[959.72 --> 960.50]  stop you from playing
[960.50 --> 961.34]  your local content,
[961.48 --> 962.12]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[962.12 --> 963.38]  and in the end,
[963.44 --> 963.82]  it's just like,
[963.86 --> 964.50]  no, it was buggy,
[964.56 --> 965.22]  so they disabled it
[965.22 --> 965.94]  so you wouldn't
[965.94 --> 966.76]  screw things up.
[966.94 --> 967.26]  Yeah.
[967.60 --> 968.28]  It's like, okay.
[969.28 --> 970.46]  It's not really a problem.
[970.58 --> 971.00]  Not going to worry
[971.00 --> 971.78]  about this too much.
[971.94 --> 972.76]  Kind of sucks for now,
[972.84 --> 973.18]  but like,
[973.94 --> 974.36]  it's Google.
[974.48 --> 974.98]  They'll fix it.
[974.98 --> 975.78]  I'm not too worried.
[975.78 --> 978.80]  With that said,
[979.10 --> 979.96]  this could be
[979.96 --> 981.18]  the most interesting thing
[981.18 --> 982.68]  I've seen out of Google
[982.68 --> 985.16]  in a while.
[985.58 --> 985.76]  I mean,
[985.80 --> 986.64]  this is the kind of thing
[986.64 --> 987.82]  that really takes the,
[987.90 --> 988.78]  I'm holding up an iPhone,
[989.00 --> 989.80]  so this is a bad example,
[990.14 --> 991.16]  but this is one of those things
[991.16 --> 991.90]  that really takes
[991.90 --> 993.08]  the phone experience
[993.08 --> 994.68]  and really enhances it
[994.68 --> 995.58]  in a way that
[995.58 --> 996.62]  five years,
[996.68 --> 997.06]  good job,
[997.30 --> 998.42]  five years from now,
[998.52 --> 999.76]  people won't even
[999.76 --> 1000.96]  think about
[1000.96 --> 1001.68]  that this was never
[1001.68 --> 1002.24]  an option.
[1002.38 --> 1002.92]  All the new patent.
[1003.28 --> 1003.68]  Yes.
[1003.88 --> 1004.50]  This is pretty cool.
[1004.50 --> 1005.48]  Their new patent
[1005.48 --> 1006.94]  allows you to change
[1006.94 --> 1007.96]  security settings
[1007.96 --> 1009.02]  for your phone
[1009.02 --> 1010.88]  based on your location.
[1011.38 --> 1011.92]  So it's taking
[1011.92 --> 1013.02]  that location data
[1013.02 --> 1015.22]  and allowing your phone
[1015.22 --> 1016.00]  to adapt
[1016.00 --> 1016.84]  to where you are.
[1017.34 --> 1018.32]  So, for example,
[1019.04 --> 1020.56]  you could be at home
[1020.56 --> 1022.58]  and instead of requiring
[1022.58 --> 1023.36]  a passcode,
[1023.54 --> 1024.26]  you could just swipe it.
[1024.64 --> 1025.18]  So, like,
[1025.22 --> 1025.84]  here's a scenario.
[1026.08 --> 1026.94]  My iPhone 4,
[1027.06 --> 1027.70]  I have set up
[1027.70 --> 1028.98]  to wipe the phone
[1028.98 --> 1030.14]  if more than five
[1030.14 --> 1030.80]  failed attempts
[1030.80 --> 1031.54]  are entered in it.
[1032.04 --> 1032.90]  My baby
[1032.90 --> 1034.48]  picks up my iPhone
[1034.48 --> 1034.74]  for,
[1034.78 --> 1035.38]  I'm getting the nod
[1035.38 --> 1036.24]  from Tim over there
[1036.24 --> 1037.02]  because, yeah,
[1037.10 --> 1037.86]  he's got kids,
[1037.92 --> 1038.26]  he knows.
[1038.82 --> 1039.50]  So my baby
[1039.50 --> 1039.98]  will pick it up
[1039.98 --> 1041.28]  and start mashing at it.
[1041.32 --> 1041.70]  He knows where
[1041.70 --> 1042.56]  the lock button is,
[1042.60 --> 1043.26]  he knows what's up,
[1043.64 --> 1044.46]  and he's, like,
[1044.54 --> 1044.76]  you know,
[1044.84 --> 1045.44]  mashing at it,
[1045.50 --> 1046.22]  and I'm, like,
[1046.26 --> 1046.62]  I run over,
[1046.70 --> 1046.88]  I'm like,
[1047.02 --> 1047.44]  no,
[1047.56 --> 1048.12]  because I haven't
[1048.12 --> 1048.52]  backed it up
[1048.52 --> 1049.08]  in a few days,
[1049.14 --> 1049.94]  please don't do that.
[1051.56 --> 1052.84]  Whereas this
[1052.84 --> 1053.44]  would allow it
[1053.44 --> 1053.98]  if I'm not out
[1053.98 --> 1054.40]  and about,
[1054.66 --> 1055.04]  he could just
[1055.04 --> 1055.62]  swipe it open,
[1055.94 --> 1056.66]  but I could still
[1056.66 --> 1057.32]  have the security
[1057.32 --> 1058.10]  if I leave my phone
[1058.10 --> 1058.76]  on the SkyTrain
[1058.76 --> 1059.62]  or something along
[1059.62 --> 1060.14]  those lines.
[1060.80 --> 1061.24]  And, I mean,
[1061.24 --> 1061.62]  there's other
[1061.62 --> 1062.42]  possibilities here,
[1062.52 --> 1062.64]  too.
[1062.92 --> 1063.72]  Like, what if I could
[1063.72 --> 1065.82]  say, allow applications
[1065.82 --> 1067.50]  to access my location
[1067.50 --> 1068.72]  data as long as
[1068.72 --> 1070.28]  I'm not 10 kilometers
[1070.28 --> 1070.70]  from home?
[1071.70 --> 1072.78]  So I could have
[1072.78 --> 1074.26]  my tweets track
[1074.26 --> 1075.52]  my location as long
[1075.52 --> 1076.24]  as I'm not somewhere
[1076.24 --> 1076.80]  where I don't want
[1076.80 --> 1077.54]  people to know about.
[1078.68 --> 1079.10]  Which is,
[1079.20 --> 1079.72]  that's a thing,
[1079.76 --> 1080.64]  it's a really big thing.
[1080.80 --> 1081.88]  Or, like,
[1081.96 --> 1082.90]  geotagging photos.
[1083.16 --> 1083.54]  You know what?
[1083.62 --> 1084.40]  Don't tag the stuff
[1084.40 --> 1084.96]  that's at home.
[1085.34 --> 1085.56]  Yeah.
[1085.88 --> 1086.76]  Tag the stuff when
[1086.76 --> 1087.30]  I'm, like,
[1087.38 --> 1088.12]  outside of,
[1088.12 --> 1088.68]  of excellent,
[1088.74 --> 1088.96]  I mean,
[1089.12 --> 1089.94]  how cool is that?
[1089.94 --> 1090.48]  Just your, like,
[1090.52 --> 1091.86]  small little area,
[1091.96 --> 1092.40]  like, where you go
[1092.40 --> 1093.16]  shopping and home
[1093.16 --> 1093.58]  and that kind of
[1093.58 --> 1093.92]  stuff, like,
[1093.96 --> 1094.28]  that could,
[1094.60 --> 1095.46]  don't geotag that.
[1095.54 --> 1095.80]  Exactly.
[1095.80 --> 1096.36]  But then once you're
[1096.36 --> 1096.90]  out in the city
[1096.90 --> 1097.66]  or out wherever.
[1098.04 --> 1098.70]  Like, I'm,
[1098.70 --> 1099.50]  I'm gonna sound
[1099.50 --> 1100.14]  like a noob here,
[1100.24 --> 1100.90]  but do you remember
[1100.90 --> 1102.64]  when I caused
[1102.64 --> 1103.32]  some trouble for
[1103.32 --> 1105.14]  myself by tweeting
[1105.14 --> 1106.70]  a photo through
[1106.70 --> 1107.88]  a third-party app
[1107.88 --> 1108.58]  and not Twitter
[1108.58 --> 1109.52]  that I had taken
[1109.52 --> 1110.12]  on my phone
[1110.12 --> 1111.16]  and it still had
[1111.16 --> 1112.14]  all of the metadata
[1112.14 --> 1112.62]  on it,
[1112.62 --> 1114.04]  including the exact
[1114.04 --> 1114.84]  coordinates of where
[1114.84 --> 1115.32]  I took it?
[1115.48 --> 1115.70]  Yeah.
[1116.28 --> 1117.76]  I didn't realize
[1117.76 --> 1119.74]  that that was just
[1119.74 --> 1120.92]  gonna be there
[1120.92 --> 1121.54]  and the app
[1121.54 --> 1122.28]  wouldn't automatically
[1122.28 --> 1122.92]  pull it out
[1122.92 --> 1123.62]  if I told it
[1123.62 --> 1124.60]  my privacy settings,
[1124.74 --> 1125.22]  I don't want my
[1125.22 --> 1125.92]  location shown.
[1126.12 --> 1127.02]  Didn't even think
[1127.02 --> 1127.48]  about it.
[1127.80 --> 1128.64]  But stuff like this,
[1128.70 --> 1129.40]  you shouldn't have
[1129.40 --> 1129.88]  to think about.
[1129.94 --> 1130.56]  Will my mother
[1130.56 --> 1131.22]  think of that?
[1131.98 --> 1132.26]  No.
[1132.50 --> 1132.86]  She's gonna,
[1133.04 --> 1133.82]  no one is even
[1133.82 --> 1134.46]  gonna tell her.
[1134.60 --> 1134.82]  Most,
[1134.98 --> 1135.42]  most,
[1135.42 --> 1136.34]  mass majority of
[1136.34 --> 1136.84]  people don't know
[1136.84 --> 1137.32]  that pictures
[1137.32 --> 1138.54]  can store location data.
[1139.34 --> 1140.46]  Mass amount of people.
[1140.46 --> 1141.86]  So this could be
[1141.86 --> 1142.46]  the solution.
[1142.82 --> 1143.06]  I mean,
[1143.16 --> 1143.76]  I kinda hate
[1143.76 --> 1144.28]  that Google's
[1144.28 --> 1145.10]  patenting it
[1145.10 --> 1146.08]  or I hope
[1146.08 --> 1147.02]  that they license it
[1147.02 --> 1147.30]  for,
[1147.42 --> 1147.66]  you know,
[1147.72 --> 1148.10]  a penny
[1148.10 --> 1149.46]  or less than a penny
[1149.46 --> 1149.78]  or something.
[1149.88 --> 1149.98]  Like,
[1150.00 --> 1150.56]  I really hope
[1150.56 --> 1151.16]  that this is something
[1151.16 --> 1151.72]  that becomes
[1151.72 --> 1153.66]  completely widespread
[1153.66 --> 1155.42]  but either way,
[1155.52 --> 1157.02]  it's a really cool idea
[1157.02 --> 1158.14]  and I'm really happy
[1158.14 --> 1158.52]  about it.
[1161.04 --> 1162.08]  Let's talk Bethesda.
[1162.14 --> 1162.90]  Did you go to their booth today?
[1163.26 --> 1164.64]  I have been avoiding.
[1164.94 --> 1165.40]  You've been avoiding it.
[1165.40 --> 1166.44]  So I need to get work done.
[1166.88 --> 1167.20]  Okay,
[1167.32 --> 1167.68]  fair enough.
[1168.14 --> 1169.22]  I will be going though.
[1169.28 --> 1169.54]  Okay,
[1169.54 --> 1170.68]  you're gonna cover that booth,
[1170.68 --> 1170.86]  right?
[1171.00 --> 1171.12]  Yeah,
[1171.20 --> 1171.64]  cause I mean,
[1171.86 --> 1173.72]  I think,
[1173.82 --> 1174.36]  so here,
[1174.48 --> 1175.64]  let's talk about this.
[1175.96 --> 1176.92]  Bethesda is pushing
[1176.92 --> 1178.58]  to drop Xbox Live
[1178.58 --> 1179.24]  gold fee
[1179.24 --> 1180.32]  for Elder Scrolls Online
[1180.32 --> 1180.90]  players.
[1181.22 --> 1182.10]  I'm gonna preface this,
[1182.20 --> 1182.86]  it won't happen.
[1183.58 --> 1184.38]  It's not gonna happen.
[1184.60 --> 1185.14]  Other companies
[1185.14 --> 1185.78]  have tried it.
[1186.00 --> 1186.84]  It didn't work for them.
[1186.98 --> 1187.50]  It's not gonna work
[1187.50 --> 1188.06]  for Bethesda.
[1188.26 --> 1189.44]  But the idea is
[1189.44 --> 1190.08]  that they're saying
[1190.08 --> 1191.42]  it doesn't have to go
[1191.42 --> 1192.26]  through their servers
[1192.26 --> 1192.54]  at all,
[1192.62 --> 1192.90]  apparently.
[1193.66 --> 1194.68]  Like Microsoft servers.
[1194.84 --> 1196.04]  So what they're claiming
[1196.04 --> 1196.84]  is that if it doesn't
[1196.84 --> 1197.66]  have to use any of that,
[1197.74 --> 1198.16]  it should be free
[1198.16 --> 1198.70]  for the players
[1198.70 --> 1199.72]  and they don't want to,
[1199.84 --> 1200.76]  they don't want to give them
[1200.76 --> 1201.88]  any of the gold services.
[1202.58 --> 1203.00]  So they don't want
[1203.00 --> 1203.80]  any of the gold services
[1203.80 --> 1204.44]  to be working.
[1204.72 --> 1205.22]  They don't want them
[1205.22 --> 1206.54]  to have access to market
[1206.54 --> 1207.54]  or whatever.
[1207.70 --> 1208.30]  I don't know what
[1208.30 --> 1209.64]  the actual new gold services are.
[1209.88 --> 1210.50]  But they want it
[1210.50 --> 1211.52]  to be able to bypass that
[1211.52 --> 1212.62]  completely and have it
[1212.62 --> 1213.54]  all connect directly
[1213.54 --> 1214.28]  to their own servers.
[1215.12 --> 1216.14]  I don't think
[1216.14 --> 1216.70]  it's gonna happen.
[1217.20 --> 1218.16]  I think that...
[1218.16 --> 1218.48]  I can't remember
[1218.48 --> 1219.18]  what the other company
[1219.18 --> 1220.14]  that tried to do it was.
[1220.40 --> 1221.78]  But they've already told Bethesda.
[1221.92 --> 1222.22]  They're like,
[1222.28 --> 1222.40]  yeah,
[1222.98 --> 1223.80]  it didn't work for us
[1223.80 --> 1224.70]  because if they did it for us,
[1224.72 --> 1225.16]  they'd have to do it
[1225.16 --> 1225.56]  for everyone.
[1226.28 --> 1227.00]  And it probably won't work
[1227.00 --> 1228.10]  for you because if they did it
[1228.10 --> 1228.34]  for you,
[1228.42 --> 1228.92]  they'd have to do it
[1228.92 --> 1229.36]  for everyone.
[1229.94 --> 1231.16]  And they really would.
[1231.54 --> 1231.90]  I mean,
[1232.02 --> 1234.16]  it's one of those things
[1234.16 --> 1234.66]  where,
[1234.66 --> 1235.02]  you know,
[1235.10 --> 1235.74]  Bethesda,
[1236.50 --> 1237.74]  however much weight
[1237.74 --> 1239.16]  they might feel like
[1239.16 --> 1240.28]  they have to pull around,
[1240.78 --> 1241.10]  you know,
[1241.34 --> 1242.32]  if they did it
[1242.32 --> 1243.10]  for Bethesda,
[1243.48 --> 1244.42]  Valve's gonna be like,
[1244.56 --> 1244.86]  yeah,
[1245.22 --> 1245.50]  yo,
[1245.96 --> 1247.28]  what's up?
[1247.80 --> 1248.80]  Blizzard's gonna be like,
[1249.04 --> 1249.40]  yo.
[1249.96 --> 1250.90]  And all of a sudden,
[1251.34 --> 1251.80]  you know,
[1252.04 --> 1252.72]  Activision,
[1253.02 --> 1253.80]  Blizzard Activision,
[1253.80 --> 1254.02]  right?
[1254.12 --> 1254.24]  So,
[1254.36 --> 1254.54]  like,
[1254.74 --> 1256.06]  everyone is gonna,
[1256.20 --> 1256.30]  so,
[1256.38 --> 1256.58]  you know,
[1256.64 --> 1258.38]  Call of Duty's not gonna require it
[1258.38 --> 1260.30]  and Diablo 3's not gonna require it
[1260.30 --> 1260.82]  and all of a sudden,
[1260.90 --> 1261.68]  what's gonna be the benefit
[1261.68 --> 1263.06]  of an Xbox Live Gold membership?
[1263.22 --> 1263.46]  Nothing.
[1264.24 --> 1264.84]  Because you'll be able
[1264.84 --> 1265.50]  to play multiplayer
[1265.50 --> 1266.00]  for everything
[1266.00 --> 1266.48]  and you know what?
[1266.54 --> 1267.60]  The fact of the matter is,
[1267.68 --> 1268.52]  especially with anything
[1268.52 --> 1269.52]  that's a PC port,
[1269.96 --> 1271.20]  these developers are gonna have
[1271.20 --> 1272.28]  their own server infrastructure
[1272.28 --> 1272.72]  anyway.
[1273.26 --> 1273.96]  Just to play
[1273.96 --> 1274.40]  Devil's Eye,
[1274.48 --> 1274.66]  if you'll,
[1274.72 --> 1274.94]  actually,
[1275.02 --> 1275.12]  no,
[1275.18 --> 1276.26]  I do agree with this.
[1276.44 --> 1276.62]  Ed,
[1276.70 --> 1278.28]  with console players,
[1278.44 --> 1278.58]  like,
[1278.72 --> 1279.86]  one big thing is Steam.
[1280.20 --> 1281.10]  You can add games to it
[1281.10 --> 1281.98]  so people can see
[1281.98 --> 1282.58]  your Steam presence
[1282.58 --> 1283.28]  in other games,
[1283.32 --> 1283.78]  like playing them,
[1283.86 --> 1284.66]  that aren't even in Steam.
[1284.76 --> 1285.86]  So I have added StarCraft 2
[1285.86 --> 1286.30]  to my Steam.
[1286.60 --> 1286.72]  Yep.
[1286.72 --> 1287.64]  So when I go in StarCraft 2,
[1288.02 --> 1289.90]  Xbox Live subscriptions,
[1290.38 --> 1291.28]  you can see people
[1291.28 --> 1291.94]  in multiple games
[1291.94 --> 1292.88]  and talk with them that way.
[1293.42 --> 1293.66]  Okay.
[1293.72 --> 1294.04]  If you didn't have
[1294.04 --> 1294.92]  an Xbox Live subscription,
[1295.30 --> 1295.84]  you wouldn't be able
[1295.84 --> 1296.28]  to do that.
[1296.46 --> 1297.42]  So if they're bypassing
[1297.42 --> 1297.98]  Xbox servers,
[1298.18 --> 1298.78]  you wouldn't be able
[1298.78 --> 1299.24]  to do that.
[1300.50 --> 1300.86]  Okay.
[1302.74 --> 1303.06]  So?
[1303.06 --> 1305.36]  That's just,
[1305.36 --> 1306.64]  that's a value
[1306.64 --> 1307.34]  that it has.
[1307.40 --> 1307.92]  It's a value
[1307.92 --> 1308.62]  that it has,
[1308.68 --> 1309.38]  but it's a value
[1309.38 --> 1309.84]  that,
[1309.94 --> 1310.18]  I mean,
[1310.26 --> 1310.68]  I wish,
[1310.82 --> 1311.88]  I wish that,
[1311.96 --> 1313.46]  I wish that Xbox
[1313.46 --> 1314.76]  was a more open platform
[1314.76 --> 1315.40]  like PC
[1315.40 --> 1316.18]  so someone could just
[1316.18 --> 1316.70]  come along
[1316.70 --> 1317.98]  and build an X-Fire
[1317.98 --> 1318.52]  or,
[1318.52 --> 1320.38]  or a Steam
[1320.38 --> 1321.22]  type of,
[1321.34 --> 1321.66]  of...
[1321.66 --> 1322.38]  But it's a console
[1322.38 --> 1323.04]  so it won't happen.
[1323.04 --> 1323.70]  But it's a console
[1323.70 --> 1324.48]  so it won't happen.
[1324.56 --> 1325.18]  So all of this
[1325.18 --> 1326.36]  is just...
[1326.36 --> 1327.32]  None of this will happen.
[1327.48 --> 1328.40]  None of it will happen,
[1328.58 --> 1328.84]  but,
[1329.68 --> 1329.96]  you know,
[1330.00 --> 1330.54]  they tried.
[1330.90 --> 1331.64]  This was posted
[1331.64 --> 1332.98]  on the Linus Tech Tips forum
[1332.98 --> 1334.94]  by TopWarGamer,
[1335.10 --> 1336.08]  so thank you very much
[1336.08 --> 1337.04]  for posting that.
[1337.46 --> 1337.80]  Although,
[1338.50 --> 1339.70]  I'd prefer if you
[1339.70 --> 1340.54]  fleshed it out
[1340.54 --> 1341.00]  a little bit more
[1341.00 --> 1341.64]  next time, man.
[1341.68 --> 1341.82]  Yeah.
[1341.92 --> 1342.92]  It's like a one-liner.
[1343.30 --> 1344.40]  I'm going to tweet this out.
[1344.40 --> 1344.86]  I guess it could,
[1345.12 --> 1345.50]  technically,
[1345.74 --> 1346.20]  we don't know,
[1346.22 --> 1347.04]  it hasn't happened yet,
[1347.10 --> 1347.90]  but like...
[1347.90 --> 1348.70]  No, it's not going to happen.
[1348.78 --> 1348.94]  Yeah.
[1349.14 --> 1350.16]  I will bet money.
[1350.46 --> 1350.78]  Okay, so...
[1350.78 --> 1351.26]  I would too.
[1351.78 --> 1352.10]  Yeah.
[1352.40 --> 1352.92]  How much money
[1352.92 --> 1353.40]  should we bet?
[1353.90 --> 1354.38]  I don't know.
[1354.46 --> 1355.42]  I'll pony up five bucks.
[1355.58 --> 1356.16]  Is this legal?
[1356.60 --> 1357.04]  I...
[1357.04 --> 1357.82]  Ooh, I don't know.
[1358.58 --> 1358.90]  Okay,
[1359.00 --> 1359.68]  moving right along.
[1359.68 --> 1362.12]  Speaking of my son
[1362.12 --> 1362.76]  playing around
[1362.76 --> 1364.04]  with my cell phone,
[1364.50 --> 1365.30]  one in ten
[1365.30 --> 1366.36]  five-year-olds
[1366.36 --> 1367.62]  apparently
[1367.62 --> 1368.96]  has a mobile
[1368.96 --> 1370.14]  phone.
[1370.26 --> 1371.22]  Will your five-year-old
[1371.22 --> 1371.92]  get a mobile phone?
[1372.02 --> 1372.30]  No.
[1373.68 --> 1374.74]  But you know what?
[1374.92 --> 1376.24]  The reality of it is
[1376.24 --> 1377.64]  things are changing
[1377.64 --> 1378.54]  so much
[1378.54 --> 1379.52]  and so quickly
[1379.52 --> 1380.62]  that
[1380.62 --> 1382.36]  I can say that now,
[1382.44 --> 1383.94]  but for all I know,
[1384.58 --> 1385.14]  maybe you will.
[1385.48 --> 1385.86]  I don't know.
[1385.86 --> 1386.58]  But at the same...
[1386.58 --> 1387.72]  Like, I think it would be
[1387.72 --> 1388.94]  more...
[1388.94 --> 1390.58]  I read into this article
[1390.58 --> 1391.54]  and one big thing
[1391.54 --> 1392.24]  is that a lot of them
[1392.24 --> 1392.82]  were using
[1392.82 --> 1393.88]  the phone
[1393.88 --> 1394.94]  and the data on the phone
[1394.94 --> 1396.08]  more than their parents were.
[1396.62 --> 1396.98]  Okay.
[1397.14 --> 1398.66]  If I was giving a phone
[1398.66 --> 1399.80]  to a five-year-old,
[1399.90 --> 1400.72]  I would want to give
[1400.72 --> 1401.80]  like a flip phone
[1401.80 --> 1404.70]  so they can have contact.
[1407.08 --> 1407.88]  Okay, hold on.
[1408.08 --> 1408.52]  Why don't we...
[1408.52 --> 1408.98]  Why don't we...
[1408.98 --> 1410.10]  Why don't we take a step back?
[1412.10 --> 1412.62]  So...
[1412.62 --> 1413.08]  So the...
[1413.08 --> 1413.30]  Hold on.
[1413.34 --> 1414.30]  So the whole thing here,
[1414.30 --> 1415.08]  I'm going to tweet this out
[1415.08 --> 1416.16]  so you guys can follow along
[1416.16 --> 1416.64]  with us here
[1416.64 --> 1417.60]  because I can't show you
[1417.60 --> 1418.34]  things on my screen
[1418.34 --> 1419.80]  because we can never
[1419.80 --> 1420.54]  have a WAN show
[1420.54 --> 1421.34]  that doesn't have
[1421.34 --> 1422.24]  any issues
[1422.24 --> 1423.34]  because that's how
[1423.34 --> 1425.00]  we roll, suckas.
[1425.60 --> 1426.82]  That's how we roll, suckas.
[1426.84 --> 1427.50]  So this was posted
[1427.50 --> 1428.96]  by ETRJ on the forum.
[1429.82 --> 1430.66]  That guy keeps changing
[1430.66 --> 1431.36]  his image
[1431.36 --> 1432.30]  so I can never
[1432.30 --> 1433.42]  recognize him right away.
[1433.78 --> 1434.28]  You know?
[1434.68 --> 1435.18]  I think it's been
[1435.18 --> 1435.74]  that one for a while.
[1435.92 --> 1436.82]  Yeah, for a little while,
[1436.88 --> 1437.46]  but before it was
[1437.46 --> 1437.98]  a different one
[1437.98 --> 1438.58]  and I think it was
[1438.58 --> 1439.04]  something else.
[1439.26 --> 1440.38]  I actually go by images
[1440.38 --> 1441.28]  with other usernames.
[1441.60 --> 1443.20]  I can't remember names
[1443.20 --> 1444.26]  but I can remember faces
[1444.26 --> 1445.14]  so that translates.
[1445.56 --> 1446.18]  Alright, so anyway,
[1446.26 --> 1447.24]  the whole thing is
[1447.24 --> 1447.76]  that more than
[1447.76 --> 1448.66]  one in ten of youngsters
[1448.66 --> 1449.84]  spends more than
[1449.84 --> 1450.68]  their mother or father
[1450.68 --> 1451.40]  on the phone
[1451.40 --> 1453.22]  so only a quarter
[1453.22 --> 1455.10]  capped their youngsters' contracts
[1455.10 --> 1456.08]  while just three percent
[1456.08 --> 1457.26]  said they disabled data
[1457.26 --> 1457.90]  on the phones
[1457.90 --> 1459.14]  so they could only be used
[1459.14 --> 1459.84]  for making calls
[1459.84 --> 1460.88]  or sending text messages.
[1461.36 --> 1462.52]  So only three percent
[1462.52 --> 1463.88]  of these parents
[1463.88 --> 1464.66]  who are buying phones
[1464.66 --> 1465.40]  for five-year-olds
[1465.40 --> 1466.54]  so we can sort of agree
[1466.54 --> 1467.26]  that they're either
[1467.26 --> 1468.06]  ahead of their time
[1468.06 --> 1469.18]  or they're completely insane.
[1469.40 --> 1470.26]  One of the two.
[1470.32 --> 1471.38]  And there's a fine line.
[1471.54 --> 1471.68]  Yeah.
[1472.04 --> 1473.02]  There's a really fine line.
[1473.02 --> 1474.64]  What could a five-year-old
[1474.64 --> 1475.40]  need a phone for?
[1477.14 --> 1478.42]  At five years old,
[1478.66 --> 1479.08]  what, like,
[1479.12 --> 1479.72]  are you in school
[1479.72 --> 1480.14]  or you're in kindergarten?
[1480.14 --> 1480.86]  You're in kindergarten.
[1481.02 --> 1482.12]  You're in kindergarten at five.
[1483.42 --> 1483.78]  Here.
[1484.02 --> 1485.16]  Okay, I'm going to pitch something
[1485.16 --> 1485.74]  as a parent.
[1486.52 --> 1487.50]  If I could install,
[1487.58 --> 1488.60]  and this actually ties in
[1488.60 --> 1489.10]  really well
[1489.10 --> 1490.48]  into the Boyfriend Tracker app,
[1490.64 --> 1491.62]  if I could install
[1491.62 --> 1492.74]  an app on their phone
[1492.74 --> 1494.40]  that I could know
[1494.40 --> 1495.00]  where they are
[1495.00 --> 1496.42]  and I could get an ETA
[1496.42 --> 1497.10]  for when they're going
[1497.10 --> 1497.86]  to be home from school,
[1497.94 --> 1498.88]  I could see them walking,
[1499.32 --> 1500.90]  I could see their last location,
[1500.90 --> 1501.50]  for example,
[1501.60 --> 1502.08]  which is a way
[1502.08 --> 1503.40]  that a lot of those apps work.
[1503.90 --> 1504.92]  So even if someone
[1504.92 --> 1506.82]  were to, you know,
[1507.12 --> 1508.04]  kidnap them
[1508.04 --> 1509.18]  and, you know,
[1509.18 --> 1510.32]  bail on the phone.
[1510.32 --> 1511.12]  Where it probably happened.
[1511.28 --> 1511.74]  And you could,
[1511.86 --> 1512.06]  I mean,
[1512.10 --> 1513.08]  you can train your kids,
[1513.14 --> 1513.86]  don't get in the car
[1513.86 --> 1514.78]  with someone or whatever else,
[1514.78 --> 1516.12]  but if someone snags them
[1516.12 --> 1517.48]  and you train your kid,
[1517.74 --> 1517.98]  yo,
[1518.14 --> 1519.48]  you keep that phone on you.
[1519.74 --> 1520.90]  You keep it turned on,
[1520.96 --> 1521.96]  but you keep it silent.
[1522.64 --> 1523.90]  Is that worth
[1524.68 --> 1525.76]  sort of the risk
[1525.76 --> 1526.32]  that they'll make
[1526.32 --> 1527.14]  a long-distance call
[1527.14 --> 1527.74]  to Timbuktu
[1527.74 --> 1528.66]  and you'll pay
[1528.66 --> 1529.76]  a few bucks for...
[1529.76 --> 1530.70]  Can you even, like,
[1530.76 --> 1531.80]  disable long-distance calling?
[1531.82 --> 1532.50]  You probably can.
[1532.74 --> 1532.98]  I mean,
[1533.14 --> 1534.22]  Android is so,
[1534.30 --> 1535.84]  Android is so customizable.
[1536.38 --> 1537.34]  Would you consider
[1537.34 --> 1538.36]  giving your five-year-old
[1538.36 --> 1538.88]  a phone
[1538.88 --> 1539.90]  if that's what it was for?
[1539.94 --> 1540.46]  This is the thing
[1540.46 --> 1541.02]  I was getting into
[1541.02 --> 1542.00]  is I would consider it,
[1542.08 --> 1542.50]  but, see,
[1542.54 --> 1543.48]  my thing was the flip phone.
[1544.38 --> 1544.58]  Right,
[1544.74 --> 1545.34]  but that wouldn't have
[1545.34 --> 1545.80]  any GPS or anything.
[1545.80 --> 1546.66]  But what you just said
[1546.66 --> 1547.78]  makes a little bit more sense,
[1547.86 --> 1548.44]  but then you'd have
[1548.44 --> 1549.46]  to do stuff like
[1549.46 --> 1550.90]  restricting data limits,
[1551.02 --> 1551.64]  doing all that kind of stuff
[1551.64 --> 1552.28]  because for GPS
[1552.28 --> 1553.10]  you don't need, like, anything.
[1553.62 --> 1553.74]  Right.
[1553.74 --> 1554.40]  So restrict data limits,
[1554.52 --> 1555.64]  like, super low.
[1555.96 --> 1556.12]  Yep.
[1556.12 --> 1557.08]  If I just wanted to know
[1557.08 --> 1557.98]  where my kid is...
[1557.98 --> 1558.24]  And, like,
[1558.30 --> 1559.20]  use parental control.
[1559.34 --> 1560.10]  And the thing, too, though,
[1560.10 --> 1560.64]  is, I mean, guys,
[1560.68 --> 1561.62]  I'm not talking about this
[1561.62 --> 1562.52]  for 16-year-olds.
[1562.78 --> 1562.92]  No.
[1563.02 --> 1564.08]  By the time we're talking
[1564.08 --> 1565.00]  about older kids,
[1565.14 --> 1566.20]  it's a different story.
[1566.58 --> 1567.36]  One, they can pay
[1567.36 --> 1568.20]  for their own bloody phone
[1568.20 --> 1568.78]  if they want one,
[1569.10 --> 1569.96]  and number two
[1569.96 --> 1572.48]  is they kind of,
[1572.66 --> 1573.88]  they have their own minds
[1573.88 --> 1574.98]  and they have their own
[1574.98 --> 1576.64]  deal at that point.
[1576.94 --> 1577.30]  Whereas,
[1577.52 --> 1578.40]  if I was looking at it
[1578.40 --> 1578.80]  going, okay,
[1578.92 --> 1580.00]  well, I've got my phone plan,
[1580.14 --> 1580.92]  which is what it is,
[1581.36 --> 1582.16]  an extra SIM
[1582.16 --> 1583.22]  might cost me nothing
[1583.22 --> 1584.10]  if I switch over
[1584.10 --> 1584.98]  to a family plan,
[1584.98 --> 1586.48]  and I have an old phone
[1586.48 --> 1587.20]  lying around,
[1587.34 --> 1587.94]  which by the time
[1587.94 --> 1588.82]  my kid's five
[1588.82 --> 1590.38]  will be four years from now.
[1590.58 --> 1591.06]  So, like,
[1591.22 --> 1591.86]  he'll be inheriting,
[1591.98 --> 1593.12]  like, an HTC One,
[1593.42 --> 1595.04]  which will be chipped
[1595.04 --> 1596.02]  and scratched and cracked
[1596.02 --> 1596.68]  or whatever else
[1596.68 --> 1597.28]  by that point,
[1597.34 --> 1598.54]  but it'll be functional.
[1599.00 --> 1599.36]  You know,
[1599.56 --> 1602.70]  if it costs me nothing,
[1602.78 --> 1603.46]  what do I care?
[1604.22 --> 1605.18]  On the other hand,
[1605.22 --> 1606.50]  are we teaching our kids
[1606.50 --> 1607.34]  to be too dependent
[1607.34 --> 1608.08]  on electronics,
[1608.50 --> 1611.30]  or are we enabling them
[1611.30 --> 1611.86]  to function
[1611.86 --> 1612.78]  in an increasingly
[1612.78 --> 1613.68]  electronic world?
[1613.68 --> 1614.58]  You can probably,
[1614.74 --> 1615.54]  there's probably something
[1615.54 --> 1616.36]  you can get for Android
[1616.36 --> 1617.70]  that blocks all numbers
[1617.70 --> 1619.20]  and then have,
[1619.36 --> 1619.44]  like,
[1619.50 --> 1620.36]  and then put it on
[1620.36 --> 1621.92]  a specific allow list.
[1622.24 --> 1622.84]  Then you can allow,
[1622.92 --> 1623.08]  like,
[1623.20 --> 1624.36]  yours and your wife's.
[1624.38 --> 1624.52]  Oh yeah,
[1624.58 --> 1625.36]  for sure that exists.
[1625.48 --> 1625.78]  I'm sure,
[1625.84 --> 1626.26]  100%.
[1626.26 --> 1627.08]  You can allow,
[1627.14 --> 1627.28]  like,
[1627.34 --> 1628.54]  yours and your wife's
[1628.54 --> 1628.86]  and maybe,
[1629.00 --> 1629.06]  like,
[1629.10 --> 1629.92]  the kid's teacher.
[1630.52 --> 1630.88]  Right.
[1631.14 --> 1632.40]  And then that's it.
[1632.54 --> 1633.14]  And then you can only
[1633.14 --> 1634.24]  call and text those numbers
[1634.24 --> 1635.10]  and then it's super
[1635.10 --> 1635.92]  restricted on data.
[1636.00 --> 1636.62]  Lock down YouTube,
[1636.84 --> 1637.54]  lock down everything.
[1637.54 --> 1637.80]  Lock down everything
[1637.80 --> 1638.68]  and just have it,
[1638.74 --> 1638.86]  like,
[1638.90 --> 1639.92]  the most lockdown thing ever
[1639.92 --> 1641.20]  so they don't really use it.
[1641.38 --> 1641.72]  I don't know,
[1641.72 --> 1641.88]  like,
[1641.94 --> 1642.66]  I guess.
[1642.84 --> 1643.28]  I mean,
[1643.30 --> 1644.34]  if we were to talk about it
[1644.34 --> 1645.76]  in this kind of a use case scenario,
[1645.82 --> 1646.68]  maybe I don't have a problem
[1646.68 --> 1647.06]  with this.
[1647.28 --> 1648.18]  That makes a lot more sense
[1648.18 --> 1649.30]  but I think this article
[1649.30 --> 1650.06]  is saying,
[1650.16 --> 1651.98]  I think it's more to do with,
[1652.54 --> 1652.82]  you know,
[1652.82 --> 1653.54]  no one's doing that.
[1653.62 --> 1653.80]  Yeah,
[1653.92 --> 1654.64]  no one's doing that
[1654.64 --> 1656.54]  because 3% were disabling data
[1656.54 --> 1657.90]  and a quarter were capping
[1657.90 --> 1658.60]  the contracts.
[1658.86 --> 1660.44]  So these are just kids,
[1661.02 --> 1661.14]  like,
[1661.28 --> 1662.00]  little kids
[1662.00 --> 1662.34]  with,
[1662.42 --> 1662.56]  like,
[1662.64 --> 1662.94]  smartphones.
[1663.18 --> 1663.58]  Smartphones.
[1663.58 --> 1664.86]  And I don't think
[1664.86 --> 1665.62]  they have the discipline
[1665.62 --> 1666.54]  at that age to go,
[1666.64 --> 1666.82]  oh,
[1666.92 --> 1667.10]  okay,
[1667.16 --> 1668.10]  that's enough of
[1668.10 --> 1669.98]  whatever free running game,
[1670.18 --> 1671.42]  temple run game of the week
[1671.42 --> 1672.40]  happens to be popular.
[1672.50 --> 1672.56]  that's not even,
[1672.56 --> 1672.88]  like,
[1673.40 --> 1674.60]  you can't expect that
[1674.60 --> 1675.22]  out of a 5.
[1675.22 --> 1675.40]  No,
[1675.48 --> 1676.10]  you can't at all.
[1676.20 --> 1676.40]  Yeah,
[1676.54 --> 1677.92]  which is why people
[1677.92 --> 1678.40]  should be using,
[1678.68 --> 1678.86]  and,
[1678.96 --> 1679.04]  like,
[1679.14 --> 1679.38]  again,
[1679.46 --> 1679.82]  like you said,
[1679.86 --> 1681.08]  this isn't a 16 year old thing.
[1681.48 --> 1681.66]  Yes.
[1681.66 --> 1682.80]  It's completely different.
[1682.92 --> 1683.62]  Totally different.
[1684.32 --> 1685.46]  Totally different thing.
[1685.60 --> 1686.92]  Take that track wrap off,
[1687.04 --> 1687.16]  blah,
[1687.18 --> 1687.28]  blah,
[1687.28 --> 1687.42]  blah,
[1687.54 --> 1687.56]  blah,
[1687.56 --> 1687.94]  but,
[1687.94 --> 1688.22]  like,
[1688.54 --> 1688.76]  yeah.
[1689.68 --> 1690.28]  You know what,
[1690.28 --> 1691.06]  I'm going to fire up
[1691.06 --> 1691.80]  Twitch chat here
[1691.80 --> 1692.38]  and I'm going to see
[1692.38 --> 1693.58]  what they have to say about it.
[1694.40 --> 1694.68]  Ah.
[1695.60 --> 1696.00]  Okay,
[1696.12 --> 1696.32]  something,
[1696.42 --> 1696.62]  something.
[1696.76 --> 1697.96]  Don't buy a thousand dollar
[1697.96 --> 1699.44]  mobile phone for a child,
[1699.56 --> 1700.74]  buy a bodyguard instead.
[1701.92 --> 1702.28]  Well,
[1702.38 --> 1702.60]  okay,
[1702.68 --> 1703.14]  but remember,
[1703.22 --> 1704.16]  what we were talking about
[1704.16 --> 1704.38]  was,
[1704.46 --> 1704.58]  like,
[1704.62 --> 1705.46]  more like them inheriting
[1705.46 --> 1706.10]  your old phone.
[1706.12 --> 1707.26]  The old throwaway phones
[1707.26 --> 1707.62]  or whatever.
[1708.30 --> 1708.78]  Someone says,
[1708.84 --> 1709.90]  what's the point of having a phone
[1709.90 --> 1710.68]  when most of the features
[1710.68 --> 1711.24]  are disabled?
[1712.12 --> 1713.18]  You must be,
[1713.18 --> 1713.50]  like,
[1713.70 --> 1714.14]  14,
[1714.42 --> 1715.02]  because,
[1715.44 --> 1716.54]  as someone who was
[1716.54 --> 1718.82]  alive and using phones,
[1719.30 --> 1720.60]  when the only functionality
[1720.60 --> 1721.74]  they had was,
[1722.40 --> 1723.14]  to be a phone,
[1724.16 --> 1725.56]  they're still useful.
[1726.40 --> 1727.44]  They're just not toys.
[1727.90 --> 1728.70]  They're just tools.
[1728.80 --> 1729.54]  But that's the point,
[1729.62 --> 1730.54]  is we would be wanting
[1730.54 --> 1731.50]  to give the little one
[1731.50 --> 1731.94]  a tool.
[1732.08 --> 1732.38]  Yes.
[1732.52 --> 1733.12]  Not a toy.
[1733.18 --> 1734.10]  So it is a completely
[1734.10 --> 1734.76]  different thing.
[1734.84 --> 1735.28]  Someone says,
[1735.36 --> 1735.96]  next topic.
[1736.08 --> 1736.54]  You know what?
[1736.58 --> 1737.98]  We will get to the next topic.
[1738.36 --> 1738.98]  In fact,
[1738.98 --> 1740.68]  we are ready for the next topic
[1740.68 --> 1741.66]  right now.
[1741.84 --> 1742.76]  So I'm trying to do some,
[1743.28 --> 1743.66]  guys,
[1743.76 --> 1744.50]  I don't know if we're going
[1744.50 --> 1745.10]  to be able to do
[1745.10 --> 1746.00]  Twitter blitz today
[1746.00 --> 1748.08]  because of the screen sharing stuff,
[1748.18 --> 1748.70]  although maybe,
[1748.86 --> 1749.52]  maybe we can.
[1749.94 --> 1750.26]  So,
[1750.26 --> 1751.14]  why don't we schedule
[1751.14 --> 1751.86]  a Twitter blitz
[1751.86 --> 1753.36]  for after this next topic?
[1753.48 --> 1754.10]  We're actually doing
[1754.10 --> 1754.68]  pretty good,
[1754.92 --> 1756.12]  burning through topics here.
[1756.82 --> 1757.18]  So,
[1758.10 --> 1759.90]  the Boyfriend Tracker app
[1759.90 --> 1761.72]  gets nixed from Google Play.
[1761.82 --> 1762.30]  So this was,
[1762.34 --> 1763.44]  this was mostly your topic,
[1763.52 --> 1764.26]  so why don't you cover this?
[1764.30 --> 1764.96]  I'm going to tweet it out
[1764.96 --> 1765.24]  right now.
[1765.30 --> 1766.24]  I can't remember exactly
[1766.24 --> 1767.14]  where it was the worst,
[1767.26 --> 1768.66]  but I believe it was Brazil.
[1768.66 --> 1771.66]  I think they got like 50,000 downloads
[1771.66 --> 1772.68]  in two months or something.
[1772.88 --> 1773.04]  Yeah,
[1773.08 --> 1773.84]  they're doing really good.
[1774.12 --> 1774.40]  And,
[1774.40 --> 1775.56]  and it just,
[1775.72 --> 1777.22]  it kind of got pretty nuts.
[1777.34 --> 1777.72]  I don't know.
[1777.84 --> 1778.04]  So,
[1778.18 --> 1779.16]  the way this app worked
[1779.16 --> 1779.92]  was that the boyfriend
[1779.92 --> 1780.90]  couldn't tell
[1780.90 --> 1782.10]  it was on the phone.
[1782.10 --> 1783.98]  So,
[1784.06 --> 1784.78]  I think you only need
[1784.78 --> 1786.08]  temporary access to the phone.
[1786.32 --> 1787.24]  So you can install it
[1787.24 --> 1788.22]  and then it runs silently.
[1788.58 --> 1789.42]  And you can access it
[1789.42 --> 1790.06]  from another phone.
[1790.14 --> 1790.92]  I've kind of got a problem
[1790.92 --> 1792.28]  with any app that runs silently
[1792.28 --> 1793.24]  on my phone like that.
[1793.36 --> 1793.52]  Like,
[1793.62 --> 1793.78]  I,
[1793.94 --> 1795.06]  if it doesn't even put
[1795.06 --> 1796.06]  an icon somewhere,
[1796.84 --> 1797.62]  that's a big problem.
[1797.88 --> 1798.04]  Yeah.
[1798.10 --> 1799.32]  I'm not happy about that.
[1799.32 --> 1799.64]  Me neither.
[1799.64 --> 1800.04]  Um,
[1800.46 --> 1800.90]  but I mean,
[1800.94 --> 1801.28]  honestly,
[1801.38 --> 1802.26]  it probably wouldn't
[1802.26 --> 1802.96]  have gotten pulled
[1802.96 --> 1803.68]  if it was called
[1803.68 --> 1804.74]  the child tracker app
[1804.74 --> 1806.12]  because I think it was
[1806.12 --> 1807.18]  more of a marketing problem.
[1807.32 --> 1807.52]  So,
[1808.52 --> 1810.60]  it's always that arms race,
[1810.66 --> 1810.82]  right?
[1810.86 --> 1812.04]  So there was another app
[1812.04 --> 1813.26]  that you could install
[1813.26 --> 1814.40]  that would detect
[1814.40 --> 1816.46]  if the boyfriend tracker app
[1816.46 --> 1816.60]  was,
[1816.68 --> 1816.86]  I mean,
[1816.94 --> 1818.06]  is this what we're
[1818.06 --> 1818.84]  moving towards though?
[1820.38 --> 1821.20]  I guess,
[1821.30 --> 1821.50]  like,
[1821.50 --> 1823.26]  would you allow
[1823.26 --> 1824.48]  a girlfriend
[1824.48 --> 1827.08]  to install
[1827.08 --> 1828.30]  a boyfriend tracker app
[1828.30 --> 1828.84]  on your phone
[1828.84 --> 1829.38]  if you knew
[1829.38 --> 1829.94]  it was there?
[1831.46 --> 1831.80]  Hmm.
[1832.36 --> 1832.58]  See,
[1832.72 --> 1832.98]  guys,
[1833.16 --> 1834.18]  hit me on the Twitch chat.
[1834.28 --> 1834.56]  Actually,
[1834.90 --> 1835.46]  Twitter Blitz,
[1835.62 --> 1836.20]  Twitter Blitz,
[1836.28 --> 1836.92]  would you allow
[1836.92 --> 1838.14]  your significant other
[1838.14 --> 1839.42]  with your permission
[1839.42 --> 1841.60]  to GPS track you?
[1841.64 --> 1841.98]  We're talking
[1841.98 --> 1843.18]  Harry Potter style,
[1843.56 --> 1844.42]  the clock showing
[1844.42 --> 1845.76]  where all the Weasleys are.
[1846.16 --> 1847.04]  Would you allow it?
[1847.28 --> 1847.66]  No,
[1847.76 --> 1849.12]  because of respect issues.
[1849.50 --> 1850.02]  Why?
[1850.34 --> 1851.20]  Because I feel like
[1851.20 --> 1851.84]  that's not respect.
[1852.12 --> 1853.40]  But you have nothing to hide.
[1853.68 --> 1853.88]  Yeah.
[1854.28 --> 1854.58]  Okay.
[1854.74 --> 1855.50]  But how can you not
[1855.50 --> 1856.16]  respect me enough
[1856.16 --> 1857.16]  to believe that I won't
[1857.16 --> 1857.52]  do anything?
[1857.86 --> 1858.88]  Would you say,
[1858.88 --> 1860.52]  you know what?
[1860.84 --> 1861.70]  If she completely
[1861.70 --> 1862.60]  and honestly came up
[1862.60 --> 1863.18]  to me and was like,
[1863.26 --> 1864.20]  I want to just,
[1864.54 --> 1865.30]  I'm worried
[1865.30 --> 1866.82]  you're going into
[1866.82 --> 1868.20]  shady parts of Surrey lately.
[1869.54 --> 1870.34]  I want to make sure
[1870.34 --> 1871.02]  you don't get jumped.
[1871.20 --> 1871.62]  I'll be like,
[1871.90 --> 1872.52]  I'm fine.
[1873.26 --> 1874.06]  But if she insists,
[1874.12 --> 1874.42]  I'll be like,
[1874.48 --> 1874.64]  okay,
[1874.68 --> 1874.90]  whatever.
[1875.36 --> 1876.48]  But if it's more like,
[1876.60 --> 1876.94]  uh,
[1877.00 --> 1877.74]  I don't trust you,
[1877.82 --> 1877.96]  blah,
[1878.04 --> 1878.14]  blah,
[1878.14 --> 1878.24]  blah,
[1878.24 --> 1878.80]  I'm going to be like,
[1878.84 --> 1878.98]  yeah,
[1879.06 --> 1879.22]  no.
[1879.22 --> 1880.16]  Okay.
[1880.38 --> 1881.94]  So if it's a safety thing,
[1882.04 --> 1882.46]  you accept,
[1882.56 --> 1883.20]  so basically,
[1883.80 --> 1884.80]  if she lies to me
[1884.80 --> 1885.62]  and says it's a safety thing,
[1885.68 --> 1886.18]  then she'll be able
[1886.18 --> 1886.88]  to get it on my phone.
[1887.00 --> 1888.00]  So basically,
[1888.00 --> 1889.18]  like the Patriot Act
[1889.18 --> 1890.04]  is okay with you.
[1890.48 --> 1890.66]  No.
[1890.88 --> 1891.24]  But,
[1891.62 --> 1892.18]  hold on,
[1892.30 --> 1893.12]  because that's pretty much
[1893.12 --> 1893.54]  what it is.
[1893.54 --> 1894.34]  That's blowing it
[1894.34 --> 1895.18]  way out of proportion.
[1895.18 --> 1899.94]  It's not for me.
[1899.94 --> 1900.88]  It shouldn't matter why.
[1901.00 --> 1901.54]  But it's not for me.
[1901.54 --> 1902.84]  Are you okay with someone
[1902.84 --> 1903.94]  tracking where you are,
[1904.00 --> 1904.90]  regardless of the reason?
[1904.92 --> 1905.18]  It's not for me.
[1905.98 --> 1907.48]  I'm doing it so it helps her mind,
[1907.56 --> 1908.40]  and it's a person
[1908.40 --> 1909.72]  that is not the government,
[1910.18 --> 1910.78]  it's my girl.
[1910.84 --> 1911.78]  That's completely
[1911.78 --> 1912.68]  blowing it out of proportion.
[1913.06 --> 1914.28]  I'm not okay at all
[1914.28 --> 1915.02]  with the Patriot Act.
[1915.12 --> 1915.74]  But that's,
[1915.80 --> 1916.06]  but that,
[1916.20 --> 1916.76]  I don't,
[1916.78 --> 1917.72]  I don't see the difference.
[1917.86 --> 1918.42]  You can't be like,
[1918.50 --> 1919.30]  you like fries,
[1919.44 --> 1920.22]  therefore you enjoy
[1920.22 --> 1920.94]  killing yourself,
[1921.04 --> 1922.22]  because fries are bad for you.
[1923.50 --> 1923.94]  Okay,
[1924.02 --> 1925.10]  that is not,
[1925.18 --> 1926.36]  actually the same thing.
[1928.06 --> 1928.42]  Okay,
[1928.48 --> 1929.00]  what about this?
[1929.26 --> 1930.26]  What if she said,
[1930.60 --> 1930.96]  she,
[1931.40 --> 1931.80]  you know,
[1931.92 --> 1932.52]  she just,
[1933.04 --> 1933.98]  I don't like the idea.
[1934.28 --> 1934.54]  Okay,
[1934.86 --> 1935.06]  okay,
[1935.22 --> 1935.68]  what if,
[1935.68 --> 1936.32]  what if she was like,
[1936.38 --> 1936.52]  look,
[1936.68 --> 1937.28]  how about sometime
[1937.28 --> 1938.38]  in the next six months,
[1938.52 --> 1939.46]  can I just like,
[1939.82 --> 1940.82]  do a spot check on you
[1940.82 --> 1941.26]  for a month,
[1941.34 --> 1942.30]  and then I'll never ask again,
[1942.42 --> 1943.48]  and it would set me at ease.
[1943.88 --> 1944.60]  What if she's just,
[1945.00 --> 1945.40]  an uneasy,
[1945.50 --> 1946.54]  so you just would not,
[1946.60 --> 1947.28]  would not accept that,
[1947.32 --> 1948.48]  but if it was for safety,
[1949.22 --> 1950.32]  then you'll do it.
[1950.32 --> 1950.84]  What if it was like,
[1950.90 --> 1952.24]  a legitimate thing for safety,
[1952.30 --> 1953.26]  and I could actually buy it?
[1953.42 --> 1953.78]  Ladies?
[1954.62 --> 1954.90]  Right,
[1954.90 --> 1956.02]  if you want to track him?
[1956.08 --> 1956.88]  But right now,
[1957.00 --> 1957.28]  no,
[1957.38 --> 1958.66]  because I don't go anywhere shady.
[1959.42 --> 1960.32]  You go to Surrey?
[1960.54 --> 1960.80]  No.
[1961.32 --> 1961.94]  What do you mean no?
[1962.20 --> 1962.38]  Yes,
[1962.38 --> 1962.60]  you do.
[1962.60 --> 1963.02]  I go to Surrey.
[1963.40 --> 1964.06]  You go through,
[1964.14 --> 1964.32]  oh,
[1964.38 --> 1965.14]  you don't go to Surrey.
[1965.24 --> 1966.02]  I don't go to Surrey.
[1966.20 --> 1967.78]  You've been to my house before.
[1967.78 --> 1970.12]  I live in Surrey.
[1970.96 --> 1972.60]  You should permanently have it installed.
[1973.04 --> 1974.18]  You live in a nicer part of Surrey.
[1974.28 --> 1974.76]  That's true.
[1975.52 --> 1975.88]  All right,
[1976.04 --> 1976.52]  so let's,
[1976.52 --> 1976.76]  I think it hurts,
[1976.98 --> 1977.16]  or,
[1978.16 --> 1978.84]  yeah,
[1979.02 --> 1979.60]  let's just not.
[1980.10 --> 1980.44]  Okay,
[1980.60 --> 1980.88]  so,
[1981.04 --> 1981.46]  basically,
[1981.60 --> 1981.86]  guys,
[1981.96 --> 1983.04]  we are going to,
[1983.68 --> 1983.94]  wait,
[1984.08 --> 1984.54]  what?
[1985.26 --> 1985.54]  Okay,
[1985.60 --> 1985.72]  well,
[1985.76 --> 1987.56]  we're going to align the Twitter window,
[1987.74 --> 1989.26]  because apparently that's a thing,
[1989.90 --> 1992.68]  and it's in the way of my Twitch thing now,
[1992.74 --> 1994.20]  which is frigging genius.
[1994.80 --> 1996.90]  So let's go ahead and see if we can get,
[1997.10 --> 1997.42]  oh,
[1997.50 --> 1997.80]  man,
[1998.04 --> 2001.52]  and my wireless connection to my little wireless keyboard thing isn't very good,
[2001.52 --> 2001.94]  so it keeps,
[2002.02 --> 2002.12]  like,
[2002.18 --> 2003.26]  glitching out to all balls.
[2003.60 --> 2003.86]  All right,
[2003.90 --> 2004.42]  here we go.
[2005.20 --> 2005.34]  Oh,
[2005.34 --> 2006.54]  someone says you're talking kind of loud.
[2006.62 --> 2007.38]  I enjoyed the whispering,
[2007.48 --> 2008.34]  because it makes like even,
[2008.40 --> 2008.52]  oh,
[2008.54 --> 2010.24]  it's not even talking about me being sexier.
[2010.32 --> 2010.44]  Okay,
[2010.46 --> 2010.56]  well,
[2010.60 --> 2011.16]  you whisper now.
[2011.48 --> 2011.72]  Well,
[2012.16 --> 2013.08]  I love everyone.
[2013.48 --> 2014.08]  How are you?
[2014.68 --> 2015.32]  How's it going?
[2015.40 --> 2016.80]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[2017.50 --> 2019.34]  We're going to get deep into these topics tonight.
[2021.68 --> 2024.18]  Have you heard of performance issues on GTX 760?
[2024.28 --> 2024.44]  Sorry,
[2024.50 --> 2025.12]  that's off topic.
[2025.62 --> 2025.94]  No,
[2026.06 --> 2028.14]  unless I'm able to turn it on or off.
[2029.30 --> 2030.30]  That's a good point.
[2030.60 --> 2031.24]  What if she said,
[2031.30 --> 2031.42]  look,
[2031.48 --> 2032.48]  I want to know where you are,
[2033.04 --> 2036.04]  but you can manually turn it off whenever you want,
[2036.16 --> 2037.60]  and it'll show your last location.
[2037.70 --> 2038.18]  I'll be fine with that,
[2038.18 --> 2040.12]  because then if I did get into a sketchy situation,
[2040.22 --> 2040.56]  I'd just be like,
[2040.60 --> 2040.80]  boop.
[2042.00 --> 2042.26]  Okay,
[2042.82 --> 2043.92]  so you're okay with her,
[2044.04 --> 2044.88]  but what if she was like,
[2044.92 --> 2045.04]  look,
[2045.08 --> 2046.48]  I'd like you to keep it on for the most part,
[2047.18 --> 2050.58]  but turn it off if you ever want it off.
[2050.60 --> 2050.74]  No,
[2050.82 --> 2051.48]  because at that point,
[2051.54 --> 2053.34]  because then you have to justify why you turned it off.
[2054.20 --> 2055.36]  I'm in a sketchy situation.
[2056.44 --> 2056.66]  Or,
[2056.74 --> 2057.96]  I'm not in a sketchy situation.
[2058.52 --> 2058.80]  Okay.
[2059.44 --> 2059.76]  Okay.
[2059.86 --> 2060.00]  No,
[2060.06 --> 2060.68]  I wouldn't if,
[2060.82 --> 2061.06]  yeah.
[2061.72 --> 2062.00]  Okay.
[2062.34 --> 2062.94]  Jacob says,
[2063.02 --> 2064.50]  wouldn't mind allowing it if she asked,
[2064.56 --> 2065.60]  but I wouldn't propose it.
[2066.00 --> 2066.76]  When someone asked,
[2066.84 --> 2067.56]  I'd ask why.
[2067.66 --> 2068.72]  She even mentions cheating.
[2068.78 --> 2069.34]  I'm gone,
[2069.46 --> 2070.20]  says David Lee.
[2070.20 --> 2072.34]  No,
[2072.40 --> 2072.82]  not at all.
[2072.88 --> 2074.36]  I should be able to live my own life.
[2074.48 --> 2075.56]  Hashtag killed my wife.
[2078.34 --> 2079.14]  Edward says,
[2079.22 --> 2080.70]  depends if I can track her too.
[2081.02 --> 2081.64]  Do you care?
[2082.04 --> 2082.58]  If you can track,
[2082.62 --> 2083.02]  if she says,
[2083.06 --> 2083.18]  look,
[2083.22 --> 2083.98]  let's track each other.
[2086.38 --> 2088.16]  Let's join our souls together.
[2088.86 --> 2091.06]  So that we always know where each other are.
[2091.54 --> 2091.80]  I just,
[2091.80 --> 2095.50]  it's funny because,
[2095.84 --> 2095.98]  oh,
[2096.02 --> 2096.78]  this is going to sound bad,
[2096.92 --> 2099.10]  but you were small enough that it like,
[2099.40 --> 2100.46]  felt right.
[2102.08 --> 2102.84]  I'm sorry.
[2103.14 --> 2104.08]  It felt so wrong,
[2104.18 --> 2105.38]  but it felt so right.
[2108.16 --> 2109.04]  Oh dear God.
[2109.16 --> 2109.40]  Okay.
[2109.48 --> 2110.20]  So if she says,
[2110.34 --> 2111.26]  you can track her too.
[2111.80 --> 2112.72]  It doesn't make a difference.
[2112.74 --> 2113.54]  It doesn't make a difference to you.
[2113.56 --> 2113.70]  Okay.
[2113.76 --> 2115.22]  And I would put her on the same thing.
[2115.28 --> 2115.50]  Be like,
[2115.52 --> 2116.60]  if you're ever going somewhere sketchy,
[2116.66 --> 2117.06]  turn it off.
[2117.28 --> 2117.48]  Okay.
[2117.48 --> 2118.18]  If you're not somewhere sketchy,
[2118.18 --> 2118.58]  leave it off.
[2118.68 --> 2120.30]  Nick figures it's okay if it's both ways.
[2120.30 --> 2121.48]  Jason says,
[2121.62 --> 2121.78]  no,
[2121.90 --> 2122.54]  because that's,
[2122.76 --> 2124.96]  that means she doesn't trust me and doesn't respect my privacy.
[2125.84 --> 2126.20]  Yeah,
[2126.20 --> 2126.76]  I would.
[2127.14 --> 2127.50]  By the way,
[2127.54 --> 2127.76]  ladies,
[2127.82 --> 2128.34]  I'm available.
[2128.56 --> 2129.08]  Says Cole.
[2129.54 --> 2130.30]  By the way,
[2130.36 --> 2130.68]  ladies.
[2130.70 --> 2134.38]  The one thing I think is you could do it as like a silent emergency thing.
[2134.90 --> 2137.68]  So if you turn it on and she starts getting GPS notifications from your phone,
[2137.74 --> 2138.50]  she knows something's wrong.
[2138.58 --> 2138.70]  Right.
[2139.04 --> 2140.04]  That makes a lot of sense.
[2140.14 --> 2140.68]  Other than that,
[2140.78 --> 2140.94]  no.
[2141.22 --> 2141.64]  Someone says,
[2141.70 --> 2143.94]  I'd never let an imaginary person track my movements.
[2144.16 --> 2144.52]  Wow.
[2144.72 --> 2144.98]  Can you,
[2145.04 --> 2147.16]  can I get a hashtag forever alone over there?
[2147.52 --> 2147.88]  Seriously.
[2148.10 --> 2148.34]  Wow.
[2149.58 --> 2149.98]  Jeez.
[2150.30 --> 2151.86]  Uh,
[2152.10 --> 2155.44]  only if she would keep a record so that I didn't have to write in my journal.
[2156.38 --> 2156.78]  Okay.
[2156.88 --> 2159.10]  I think we're going to move on to our next topic here.
[2159.68 --> 2160.06]  So,
[2160.18 --> 2160.50]  uh,
[2161.62 --> 2164.16]  EA catches flack over plants and zombies.
[2164.32 --> 2168.60]  This was actually submitted via Twitter by Joseph Chang.
[2168.74 --> 2170.68]  So I'm going to go ahead and tweet out a tweet.
[2170.90 --> 2172.22]  I guess I could just retweet it.
[2172.72 --> 2173.08]  Right.
[2173.24 --> 2173.46]  Lol.
[2173.46 --> 2173.58]  Lol.
[2173.58 --> 2177.66]  Your account may not be allowed to perform this action.
[2177.78 --> 2178.70]  Are you freaking kidding me?
[2179.50 --> 2180.04]  Come on,
[2180.08 --> 2180.32]  Twitter.
[2180.50 --> 2181.46]  Don't let me down.
[2181.56 --> 2182.98]  I've had a hard enough day already.
[2183.06 --> 2185.00]  We're going to tweet the URL to a tweet.
[2185.08 --> 2186.14]  My tweet was posted.
[2186.34 --> 2186.88]  So anyway,
[2186.88 --> 2188.00]  um,
[2188.32 --> 2190.64]  why don't you talk about this while I set up our,
[2190.64 --> 2190.98]  uh,
[2191.04 --> 2193.96]  so the reviews for plants versus zombies on mobile,
[2194.10 --> 2195.70]  I believe this was the Google play store.
[2195.86 --> 2196.08]  Yeah.
[2196.38 --> 2199.68]  So the Google play store reviews for plants versus zombies are horrible.
[2199.90 --> 2202.56]  And if you're wondering why it's because you have to buy the plants.
[2203.10 --> 2203.62]  And I,
[2203.70 --> 2204.78]  I can't remember exactly.
[2204.88 --> 2205.78]  I don't have the laptop in front.
[2205.78 --> 2208.28]  I think it was something like by the time you buy a few plants,
[2208.34 --> 2209.24]  it's like 20 bucks.
[2209.38 --> 2211.40]  I think it was like three bucks for the sunflower plant,
[2211.50 --> 2213.10]  which is pretty much required to play the game.
[2214.22 --> 2214.92]  Come on.
[2215.00 --> 2215.34]  Yay.
[2215.62 --> 2218.02]  Did you not make enough money from plants versus zombies?
[2218.28 --> 2222.00]  Was it not enough of a blatant cash in to do plants versus zombies too?
[2222.16 --> 2223.00]  They have it at,
[2223.06 --> 2224.00]  have you checked out the packs?
[2224.12 --> 2225.12]  Does it look different?
[2226.20 --> 2226.74]  It does.
[2226.90 --> 2228.32]  There's more units and stuff,
[2228.56 --> 2229.08]  but like,
[2229.30 --> 2233.46]  one thing that I saw was the sunflower thing looked like it had like a,
[2233.46 --> 2234.50]  a sun beam thing,
[2234.62 --> 2234.92]  which is,
[2234.92 --> 2237.34]  but we're just talking pay to win.
[2237.86 --> 2238.98]  Like honestly,
[2239.52 --> 2240.10]  you know,
[2240.20 --> 2241.66]  as evil as it is,
[2241.72 --> 2246.72]  I think candy crush saga probably did it best where you can play the game.
[2247.78 --> 2249.82]  No matter what the whole game,
[2249.92 --> 2252.20]  but if you want to get through faster,
[2252.38 --> 2253.44]  have you played candy crush?
[2253.84 --> 2254.00]  No.
[2254.10 --> 2254.34]  Okay.
[2254.40 --> 2258.94]  So there's a timer on how often you can get a new lives.
[2259.28 --> 2263.28]  So you get five at a time and it peaks there and then you got to wait 20
[2263.28 --> 2264.68]  minutes or whatever for a new life.
[2264.68 --> 2266.14]  And you can share,
[2266.40 --> 2266.92]  you can buy more,
[2267.00 --> 2267.66]  you can buy more,
[2267.66 --> 2270.56]  or you can gift them to each other on Facebook and stuff.
[2271.14 --> 2272.50]  And that doesn't cost anything.
[2272.72 --> 2274.34]  So it spreads the game,
[2274.64 --> 2275.34]  which is brilliant.
[2275.82 --> 2278.22]  It gets people to pay to play faster too,
[2278.30 --> 2279.00]  because they're enjoying it.
[2279.04 --> 2279.68]  They're addicted to it,
[2279.68 --> 2280.38]  which is brilliant.
[2280.38 --> 2283.64]  And you can have the entire game experience.
[2283.78 --> 2284.78]  But it's not really needed.
[2284.90 --> 2285.82]  Because it's not needed.
[2285.94 --> 2287.12]  I'm surprisingly okay with that.
[2287.44 --> 2287.64]  Yeah.
[2287.86 --> 2288.30]  I'm down.
[2288.62 --> 2288.98]  I'm down.
[2289.38 --> 2289.68]  I mean,
[2289.80 --> 2293.22]  someone who is a total cheap person,
[2293.32 --> 2294.04]  like my wife,
[2294.74 --> 2296.24]  who won't pay any money for it,
[2296.24 --> 2296.60]  doesn't have to.
[2296.60 --> 2296.92]  They have to.
[2296.92 --> 2298.26]  They have to pay her five games and then that's it.
[2298.32 --> 2299.28]  And that's probably fine.
[2299.28 --> 2300.92]  And she'll team up with her coworkers at work,
[2301.00 --> 2302.84]  so they can all gift turns to each other.
[2302.86 --> 2304.52]  Do you get like gifted turns?
[2304.62 --> 2304.78]  Yeah.
[2305.00 --> 2305.88]  So you don't get them,
[2305.92 --> 2306.84]  but you can trade them off?
[2306.84 --> 2307.36]  You can do both.
[2307.72 --> 2308.00]  Okay.
[2308.10 --> 2308.28]  Yeah.
[2308.56 --> 2308.76]  Yeah.
[2308.76 --> 2308.96]  I mean,
[2308.98 --> 2309.26]  it's great.
[2309.80 --> 2309.98]  Yeah.
[2310.08 --> 2310.52]  Very cool.
[2310.66 --> 2311.00]  That's cool.
[2311.06 --> 2311.34]  But yeah,
[2311.40 --> 2311.56]  okay.
[2311.66 --> 2312.72]  Like this pairs in.
[2312.78 --> 2313.42]  I don't know if this,
[2313.50 --> 2315.42]  is this a topic here where they're saying all,
[2315.60 --> 2317.60]  all of EA's major titles are going free to play?
[2318.04 --> 2318.34]  Uh,
[2318.38 --> 2318.74]  yeah,
[2318.74 --> 2320.02]  I think we do have that topic.
[2320.06 --> 2320.88]  We might as well jump in.
[2320.88 --> 2321.92]  We might as well jump in there.
[2322.00 --> 2322.12]  Okay,
[2322.18 --> 2322.36]  guys.
[2322.42 --> 2324.98]  So this was a Linus Tech Tips forum topic as well.
[2325.12 --> 2327.28]  So it was submitted by QWERTY Warrior,
[2327.76 --> 2329.26]  which is basically just a,
[2329.26 --> 2329.58]  uh,
[2330.00 --> 2332.86]  a smart arse way of saying keyboard warrior,
[2333.00 --> 2333.76]  but I love it.
[2334.12 --> 2337.62]  But only in North America and other regions where they do not use the
[2337.62 --> 2340.40]  Azurety or Quirty or whatever the other things are.
[2341.04 --> 2341.32]  Anyway,
[2341.78 --> 2342.26]  so.
[2344.02 --> 2344.58]  Dvorak.
[2345.20 --> 2345.48]  Yeah.
[2345.96 --> 2348.20]  So this is on nextpowerup.com.
[2348.20 --> 2353.48]  And according to a recent interview with their chief operations officer,
[2353.58 --> 2354.20]  Peter Moore.
[2354.76 --> 2355.28]  Epic interview.
[2355.56 --> 2356.62]  Moving forward,
[2357.14 --> 2362.56]  all of Electronic Arts' major franchises would be embracing a free-to-play
[2362.56 --> 2364.38]  online business model.
[2364.48 --> 2367.24]  Right in the middle of a fairly normal interview,
[2367.24 --> 2369.34]  just drops the biggest bomb.
[2369.90 --> 2371.00]  And it's funny because,
[2371.36 --> 2372.34]  you know what?
[2372.38 --> 2373.52]  They were on a roll there.
[2373.72 --> 2374.56]  They were two weeks,
[2374.62 --> 2374.82]  I think?
[2374.86 --> 2375.84]  Two weeks in a row.
[2376.04 --> 2376.46]  We had,
[2376.58 --> 2377.14]  like,
[2377.60 --> 2378.38]  touchy-feely,
[2378.76 --> 2380.14]  self-hug,
[2380.38 --> 2381.34]  EA moments.
[2382.18 --> 2383.04]  And now they do this.
[2383.10 --> 2383.32]  So,
[2384.16 --> 2385.18]  he basically said,
[2385.26 --> 2387.30]  we don't ship a game at EA that is offline.
[2387.74 --> 2388.68]  It just doesn't happen.
[2389.48 --> 2389.88]  Gamers,
[2390.12 --> 2390.42]  I'm sorry.
[2391.24 --> 2391.40]  Uh.
[2391.40 --> 2391.72]  Uh.
[2391.96 --> 2392.40]  Massive.
[2392.40 --> 2396.30]  I'm just quoting.
[2396.54 --> 2396.68]  Yeah,
[2396.74 --> 2396.92]  no idea.
[2396.92 --> 2397.30]  This is a direct quote,
[2397.38 --> 2397.50]  man.
[2397.68 --> 2397.78]  Yeah.
[2397.88 --> 2398.10]  Whatever.
[2398.36 --> 2398.60]  Anyway,
[2398.82 --> 2399.54]  it doesn't happen.
[2399.74 --> 2400.90]  Gamers want to be connected,
[2401.08 --> 2402.94]  so their stats and achievements reflect who they are.
[2403.00 --> 2403.10]  Yeah,
[2403.16 --> 2403.78]  stats and achievements.
[2403.78 --> 2403.98]  Yeah,
[2403.98 --> 2404.32]  there we go.
[2404.50 --> 2404.64]  Sure.
[2404.90 --> 2405.02]  All right.
[2405.02 --> 2405.68]  Um,
[2405.70 --> 2406.10]  so blah,
[2406.12 --> 2406.18]  blah,
[2406.22 --> 2406.32]  blah,
[2406.32 --> 2406.36]  blah,
[2406.44 --> 2406.62]  something,
[2406.72 --> 2406.88]  something,
[2407.00 --> 2407.18]  something,
[2407.30 --> 2407.60]  et cetera,
[2407.68 --> 2407.94]  et cetera,
[2408.02 --> 2408.38]  et cetera.
[2408.70 --> 2409.06]  Um,
[2409.68 --> 2413.14]  Moore touted that their existing free-to-play efforts with their most successful games,
[2413.22 --> 2414.08]  Battlefield and FIFA.
[2414.34 --> 2416.64]  I don't think he quite understands what free-to-play means.
[2417.52 --> 2417.96]  Because.
[2419.00 --> 2419.40]  Battlefield,
[2419.78 --> 2420.06]  uh,
[2420.14 --> 2420.38]  there's,
[2420.42 --> 2421.78]  there's Battlefield 3 or whatever.
[2422.40 --> 2422.74]  Okay.
[2422.90 --> 2424.04]  It's not Battlefield 3,
[2424.28 --> 2424.78]  I don't think.
[2424.86 --> 2425.04]  Yeah.
[2425.04 --> 2425.74]  It's like there's.
[2425.84 --> 2426.12]  Okay.
[2426.64 --> 2427.52]  So with their,
[2427.64 --> 2428.82]  with their most successful,
[2429.14 --> 2431.48]  so I guess they're saying their most successful franchises.
[2431.86 --> 2432.20]  So,
[2432.48 --> 2433.94]  yeah.
[2433.94 --> 2434.78]  Um,
[2434.90 --> 2439.16]  I don't necessarily think they're going to take Battlefield 4 or Battlefield 5 and make them free-to-play,
[2439.26 --> 2442.56]  but I guess they're going to look at monetizing older games this way.
[2442.78 --> 2443.08]  And I think,
[2443.20 --> 2443.50]  yeah,
[2443.58 --> 2445.06]  I think they'll take older platforms and more,
[2445.16 --> 2445.94]  more,
[2445.94 --> 2446.30]  more,
[2446.48 --> 2448.64]  little kind of scaled down platforms make them free-to-play,
[2448.70 --> 2451.60]  and this might be a more major turn for the future as well.
[2451.86 --> 2453.98]  Maybe Battlefield 6 comes out fully free-to-play.
[2454.06 --> 2454.44]  Who knows?
[2454.72 --> 2455.52]  Or something like that.
[2455.56 --> 2455.76]  I mean,
[2455.80 --> 2455.96]  I,
[2456.06 --> 2458.26]  I gotta wonder at what point though,
[2458.26 --> 2458.92]  because I mean,
[2459.04 --> 2461.44]  free-to-play has worked so well because it was different.
[2462.10 --> 2462.42]  Whereas,
[2462.42 --> 2470.84]  I think that people will eventually wise up to that if they bought the MP5 in Battlefield 4,
[2471.04 --> 2472.88]  and they're buying it again in Battlefield 5,
[2472.96 --> 2474.06]  and again in Battlefield 6,
[2474.14 --> 2477.00]  that they've just given EA $16 for the same gun.
[2477.24 --> 2477.96]  A lot of people,
[2478.18 --> 2478.34]  the,
[2478.34 --> 2479.64]  the anger bubble is growing.
[2480.16 --> 2482.32]  The anger bubble is definitely growing over free-to-play.
[2482.32 --> 2484.30]  Speaking of anger bubbles,
[2484.46 --> 2485.62]  Nintendo 2DS.
[2485.78 --> 2487.16]  So this was a Joystick article.
[2487.16 --> 2488.24]  I'm going to tweet this out.
[2489.28 --> 2489.64]  Um,
[2490.04 --> 2491.60]  it looks like a kid's toy,
[2491.98 --> 2493.00]  which I guess it is,
[2493.10 --> 2494.20]  but it,
[2495.06 --> 2496.84]  it doesn't look like a very good kid's toy.
[2496.90 --> 2497.72]  I wouldn't buy it for my kid.
[2498.04 --> 2499.96]  My favorite thing was when I was looking at it,
[2500.04 --> 2500.42]  I was like,
[2500.50 --> 2500.72]  oh,
[2500.84 --> 2502.40]  that doesn't look very comfortable to hold.
[2502.74 --> 2503.04]  No.
[2503.38 --> 2504.54]  And then you see the kid playing,
[2504.62 --> 2504.92]  and he's like,
[2505.38 --> 2505.60]  eh.
[2506.10 --> 2506.60]  And I'm like,
[2506.66 --> 2506.82]  yeah,
[2506.94 --> 2507.08]  that,
[2507.08 --> 2508.50]  that doesn't look comfortable.
[2508.50 --> 2509.14]  That looked better.
[2509.66 --> 2509.78]  It,
[2509.78 --> 2510.04]  it,
[2510.04 --> 2511.40]  it really looks like,
[2511.40 --> 2511.68]  um,
[2511.74 --> 2512.64]  like Fisher Price.
[2513.00 --> 2513.66]  And this,
[2513.72 --> 2515.04]  this wedge shape they're going for,
[2515.12 --> 2515.36]  you know,
[2515.72 --> 2518.56]  Sony tried a wedge shape for a tablet.
[2519.14 --> 2520.58]  It was a complete and utter failure.
[2521.04 --> 2521.36]  They were like,
[2521.42 --> 2521.60]  yeah,
[2521.70 --> 2521.86]  well,
[2521.88 --> 2523.40]  our concept is that we,
[2523.52 --> 2523.72]  uh,
[2523.86 --> 2525.64]  we want it to feel like holding a book.
[2526.56 --> 2528.48]  If I wanted to feel like I was holding a book,
[2528.58 --> 2529.16]  I'd hold a book.
[2529.16 --> 2529.56]  Hold a book.
[2530.36 --> 2532.66]  If I wanted to feel like I was holding a doorstop,
[2532.88 --> 2534.00]  I'd hold a doorstop.
[2534.20 --> 2535.64]  I'd mod a screen into it.
[2535.76 --> 2536.28]  Or two.
[2538.48 --> 2539.60]  And it wouldn't be 3D.
[2539.88 --> 2540.08]  Yeah.
[2540.72 --> 2541.80]  My thing is like,
[2542.54 --> 2542.90]  okay,
[2543.02 --> 2544.64]  release a cost it down version.
[2544.80 --> 2546.72]  Release a cost it down version that's a 2DS.
[2546.86 --> 2547.08]  Okay,
[2547.16 --> 2547.70]  that's fine.
[2547.94 --> 2549.72]  That's what a lot of people have been asking for anyways.
[2550.12 --> 2550.98]  Add a freaking hinge.
[2551.36 --> 2552.04]  And I mean,
[2552.16 --> 2554.10]  the fact that one of the screens is smaller,
[2554.24 --> 2557.32]  like I understand the touchscreen really is a secondary screen.
[2557.52 --> 2558.52]  But when you look at the,
[2558.52 --> 2558.78]  like the,
[2558.78 --> 2560.44]  like the bomb cost for something like a phone,
[2560.48 --> 2563.20]  when you actually like look at what these screens cost,
[2563.28 --> 2564.92]  how many pennies did they save?
[2565.24 --> 2569.54]  Like really pennies or even a dollar by doing it this way.
[2569.56 --> 2569.82]  And I mean,
[2569.82 --> 2573.34]  I understand that a dollar over 10 million units is now $10 million.
[2573.66 --> 2574.32]  I get that.
[2574.38 --> 2575.14]  I really do.
[2575.78 --> 2576.12]  But,
[2577.38 --> 2577.94]  okay,
[2578.04 --> 2579.92]  so it plays all 3DS and VS games,
[2580.04 --> 2580.72]  but in 2D,
[2581.50 --> 2583.78]  which I guess is sort of a step in the right direction.
[2584.12 --> 2584.28]  Yeah.
[2584.66 --> 2585.18]  It's too,
[2585.18 --> 2587.36]  it's too bad that the device itself is 2D.
[2592.56 --> 2592.92]  Anyway.
[2592.92 --> 2593.44]  I just,
[2593.64 --> 2594.36]  if it folded,
[2594.76 --> 2597.30]  I would actually be completely on the other side of the team.
[2597.48 --> 2597.98]  Like if you,
[2599.90 --> 2603.86]  so with that,
[2603.92 --> 2606.12]  I'm actually going to segue into,
[2606.32 --> 2608.98]  and I know this is going to be awkward because this is not Squarespace.
[2608.98 --> 2609.50]  So,
[2609.50 --> 2610.82]  we,
[2610.90 --> 2612.26]  we have gone through,
[2612.26 --> 2615.28]  we have gone through quite a thing over the last,
[2615.36 --> 2617.14]  over the last little bit here.
[2617.30 --> 2618.66]  So we're going desktop.
[2619.36 --> 2620.58]  We're going this.
[2620.82 --> 2626.14]  We're going to our new sponsor for this week,
[2626.20 --> 2627.96]  which we're actually pretty excited about.
[2627.96 --> 2629.66]  So if you guys haven't heard of hotspot shield,
[2630.12 --> 2634.20]  it's basically either an app or a service kind of depending on how you use it.
[2634.24 --> 2635.22]  It's definitely a service,
[2635.22 --> 2637.60]  but it's also an app available for mobile platforms.
[2637.80 --> 2639.00]  That is a VPN.
[2639.34 --> 2641.92]  So if you're not familiar with what a VPN is,
[2641.92 --> 2645.22]  can you give sort of the networking explanation of what that means?
[2645.68 --> 2646.08]  It's,
[2646.18 --> 2646.42]  it's,
[2646.60 --> 2646.88]  you're,
[2646.94 --> 2650.66]  you're basically making it so everyone on the outside of your computer thinks that
[2650.66 --> 2651.84]  your computer is somewhere else.
[2652.04 --> 2653.30]  And is someone else.
[2653.38 --> 2654.30]  And is someone else.
[2654.44 --> 2657.94]  So basically the implications for that is if you don't want your,
[2657.96 --> 2659.60]  your activity logged by your ISP,
[2660.04 --> 2661.00]  you can use a VPN.
[2661.18 --> 2664.54]  If you don't want search providers and all this kind of stuff creating profiles
[2664.54 --> 2664.92]  for you,
[2665.12 --> 2665.96]  you can use a VPN.
[2666.22 --> 2668.96]  If you're behind a school firewall and you really need to get contact with your
[2668.96 --> 2669.92]  mom and you can't call her,
[2669.96 --> 2670.28]  but you know,
[2670.28 --> 2670.96]  she's on Facebook,
[2671.36 --> 2672.26]  you can use a VPN.
[2672.60 --> 2674.12]  There's a whole bunch of other use cases,
[2674.24 --> 2674.70]  but those are,
[2674.78 --> 2675.66]  I mean,
[2675.74 --> 2679.50]  I think one of the strongest use cases for it is getting around regional
[2679.50 --> 2680.14]  restrictions.
[2680.44 --> 2680.88]  I mean,
[2680.94 --> 2685.06]  as a Canadian where really I feel like America's hat a lot of the time.
[2685.06 --> 2685.60]  And I'm like,
[2685.72 --> 2685.86]  yeah,
[2685.92 --> 2687.94]  I understand this is an American TV show.
[2687.96 --> 2689.88]  We want real Netflix too.
[2690.28 --> 2690.96]  But right.
[2692.22 --> 2692.60]  You know,
[2692.78 --> 2692.96]  why,
[2693.72 --> 2697.56]  why am I getting the sort of like Pablum edition of everything?
[2698.10 --> 2698.24]  And,
[2698.32 --> 2698.50]  you know,
[2698.60 --> 2701.02]  I think something like South Park was one of the things that was most
[2701.02 --> 2703.36]  frustrating to me back when they used to stream it on,
[2703.40 --> 2704.46]  I guess it was Comedy Central.
[2704.46 --> 2707.22]  And all of a sudden there was this regional restriction.
[2707.38 --> 2707.48]  No,
[2707.48 --> 2707.66]  sorry,
[2707.72 --> 2708.88]  we can't stream this in Canada.
[2708.88 --> 2709.36]  And I'm like,
[2709.40 --> 2709.60]  are you,
[2709.62 --> 2710.56]  are you freaking kidding me?
[2710.82 --> 2712.56]  A VPN will get around that.
[2712.92 --> 2716.22]  So the way that their service works is I think there's a couple of different,
[2716.22 --> 2716.92]  um,
[2716.92 --> 2720.96]  there's a couple of different places where your VPN IP can come from.
[2720.96 --> 2726.08]  So it will appear as if your traffic is coming from somewhere other than where you're actually
[2726.08 --> 2726.54]  located.
[2726.72 --> 2729.72]  So I know that they can assign US ones very easily.
[2729.72 --> 2734.56]  So if you're someone in Australia or Canada or the UK and you want to get access to US,
[2734.56 --> 2735.24]  um,
[2735.24 --> 2737.20]  IP services or,
[2737.20 --> 2738.84]  or US shows or anything like that,
[2739.06 --> 2740.30]  this can be a great way to do it.
[2740.60 --> 2740.82]  Um,
[2740.82 --> 2744.72]  something that they also advertise is that if you're on a mobile data plan,
[2744.76 --> 2746.64]  it only works on iOS right now.
[2746.64 --> 2747.88]  So something like an iPhone,
[2748.06 --> 2753.50]  it can actually compress web pages that you're downloading on the fly for you so that you actually
[2753.50 --> 2756.18]  effectively use less of your data.
[2756.62 --> 2759.48]  So because they are an intermediary for the connection,
[2760.04 --> 2761.70]  the website sends it to them.
[2761.88 --> 2762.18]  They go,
[2762.26 --> 2762.38]  oh,
[2762.46 --> 2762.64]  okay,
[2762.72 --> 2764.00]  this could be compressed a little bit.
[2764.00 --> 2765.08]  And then it goes,
[2765.26 --> 2765.90]  if they beam that,
[2766.00 --> 2767.08]  like I'm using the word beam,
[2767.16 --> 2767.66]  I sound like,
[2767.82 --> 2769.38]  I sound like a politician series of tubes.
[2769.38 --> 2769.62]  Beam me up,
[2769.68 --> 2769.92]  go there.
[2770.00 --> 2770.18]  Okay.
[2770.24 --> 2770.98]  So they tube it,
[2771.28 --> 2771.52]  uh,
[2771.52 --> 2772.18]  to your phone.
[2772.28 --> 2772.64]  So your,
[2772.74 --> 2779.14]  your mobile carrier actually never sees that larger data set that the website would have
[2779.14 --> 2779.86]  served to you.
[2780.38 --> 2783.94]  So this is particularly useful if you're viewing full desktop versions of websites,
[2783.94 --> 2785.56]  which can be full of all kinds of,
[2785.88 --> 2786.10]  you know,
[2786.12 --> 2787.08]  whether it's flash banners,
[2787.18 --> 2788.50]  which is less of a concern these days,
[2788.50 --> 2789.44]  but any kind of,
[2789.44 --> 2789.92]  uh,
[2789.92 --> 2791.68]  content that is going to be very data.
[2791.78 --> 2791.98]  I mean,
[2791.98 --> 2793.98]  you could load up a thread on the line of tech tips for,
[2794.00 --> 2795.12]  you know,
[2795.20 --> 2797.18]  two mag massive pictures in it by accident.
[2797.18 --> 2797.64]  And it's like,
[2797.72 --> 2798.40]  oh crap.
[2798.98 --> 2799.28]  Right.
[2799.64 --> 2800.30]  So anyway,
[2800.38 --> 2801.06]  there you go guys.
[2801.16 --> 2801.74]  Hotspot shield.
[2801.84 --> 2803.84]  We do have an offer code for you guys,
[2803.84 --> 2807.64]  so you can save up to 20% off with the code Linus.
[2807.78 --> 2809.22]  So definitely go check that out.
[2809.30 --> 2811.54]  The free version of the application is available.
[2811.70 --> 2812.16]  However,
[2812.16 --> 2819.52]  it definitely is pretty aggressive about prompting you to take advantage of the paid version.
[2819.88 --> 2822.62]  So if you do decide that you like the service,
[2822.72 --> 2824.94]  you can get a trial as well that is ad free.
[2824.94 --> 2827.20]  So if you try that one out and you decide you like it,
[2827.28 --> 2831.50]  please do remember to use code Linus and you can save a few bucks on that.
[2831.66 --> 2838.12]  So thank you very much again to hotspot shield for sponsoring the WAN show here in our sort of haphazard,
[2838.18 --> 2838.46]  uh,
[2838.82 --> 2840.34]  setup that we've got going on here.
[2840.34 --> 2843.52]  And let's go ahead and move into our next topic.
[2843.62 --> 2845.02]  Speaking of sponsors for the WAN show,
[2845.08 --> 2845.98]  I guess we might as well,
[2846.46 --> 2850.22]  we forgot to wear our headsets because we barely even remembered to pack them.
[2850.32 --> 2851.84]  We were like running around everywhere.
[2852.20 --> 2852.68]  There we go.
[2852.78 --> 2853.54]  Razor comms.
[2853.80 --> 2855.70]  So if you guys haven't tried Razor comms yet,
[2855.78 --> 2861.50]  it's Razor's voice chat platform that you can use for chatting with your fellow gamers.
[2861.80 --> 2865.12]  It has overlays that don't kill you the same way the Skype ones do.
[2865.12 --> 2867.34]  And for all of you guys,
[2867.34 --> 2871.82]  when we did our video about why we were using Razor comms for Collins,
[2872.14 --> 2873.74]  for all of you guys who were all like,
[2874.00 --> 2874.16]  yeah,
[2874.18 --> 2875.62]  you guys really brought up that,
[2875.64 --> 2875.92]  uh,
[2876.14 --> 2878.68]  the Skype IP resolver thing is a problem.
[2878.88 --> 2879.24]  Um,
[2879.26 --> 2880.00]  the beta fixed it.
[2880.04 --> 2880.14]  Yeah.
[2880.14 --> 2881.18]  The beta didn't fix it.
[2881.38 --> 2886.56]  So we actually have a huge apology that we owe to Shaw.
[2887.00 --> 2887.52]  Yeah.
[2887.64 --> 2888.62]  Our internet provider.
[2888.78 --> 2890.52]  We thought they were throttling us.
[2890.60 --> 2893.12]  One of the times it was an issue with them,
[2893.12 --> 2894.62]  which was just terrible,
[2894.96 --> 2895.74]  terrible luck.
[2896.04 --> 2896.14]  Timing.
[2896.22 --> 2896.50]  Yeah.
[2896.50 --> 2897.44]  Terrible timing,
[2897.56 --> 2900.94]  which led us to believe that that cemented the diagnosis for us.
[2901.06 --> 2905.24]  So they've actually only had a problem with our connection one time.
[2905.36 --> 2906.36]  Other than that,
[2906.60 --> 2909.66]  in spite of Skype beta being used,
[2910.12 --> 2910.34]  uh,
[2910.34 --> 2911.56]  the IP resolver works.
[2911.70 --> 2912.86]  We were being DDoSed.
[2912.90 --> 2916.64]  So we will no longer be using Skype internally at all.
[2916.78 --> 2917.26]  We can't.
[2917.42 --> 2918.40]  Skype is dead to me.
[2918.78 --> 2919.26]  Um,
[2919.30 --> 2920.76]  so I'm going to be using,
[2921.36 --> 2923.16]  I'll be using Razor comms for,
[2923.34 --> 2923.54]  again,
[2923.54 --> 2924.58]  for voice communication.
[2924.58 --> 2926.28]  I'll be using Google talk.
[2926.28 --> 2928.44]  I'll be using anything but Skype at this point.
[2928.54 --> 2928.92]  So guys,
[2929.02 --> 2929.94]  if you're using Skype,
[2930.50 --> 2930.94]  ditch it.
[2931.24 --> 2935.20]  It's time because it is as simple as anyone knowing your Skype username.
[2935.20 --> 2936.06]  That's it.
[2936.14 --> 2936.68]  They key it in.
[2936.68 --> 2938.50]  They see not only your current IP,
[2939.14 --> 2942.10]  but a history of IPs where you've signed into Skype.
[2942.24 --> 2944.26]  So they're going to have the IP of your office,
[2944.56 --> 2945.08]  your home,
[2945.54 --> 2946.70]  your mother's home,
[2946.80 --> 2949.06]  wherever you happen to sign into Skype and use it.
[2949.06 --> 2949.78]  So guys,
[2951.04 --> 2951.74]  peace out,
[2951.82 --> 2952.06]  Skype.
[2952.16 --> 2953.10]  It was nice knowing you.
[2953.22 --> 2954.16]  I preferred MSN.
[2954.34 --> 2954.62]  Thanks.
[2955.38 --> 2955.80]  All right.
[2955.88 --> 2956.14]  Me too.
[2956.20 --> 2957.30]  I love those old usernames.
[2957.92 --> 2959.98]  Everyone's old usernames on MSN were amazing.
[2960.92 --> 2961.98]  It's just so good.
[2962.22 --> 2962.78]  All right.
[2963.04 --> 2963.98]  What do we got here?
[2964.10 --> 2964.38]  Ah,
[2965.02 --> 2966.46]  ad block buying ads.
[2966.54 --> 2967.32]  This is fascinating.
[2967.44 --> 2967.70]  So this,
[2967.86 --> 2968.72]  did you see my notes?
[2968.84 --> 2969.00]  Oh,
[2969.04 --> 2969.78]  is it live again?
[2969.94 --> 2971.88]  I feel very strongly about this.
[2973.34 --> 2973.74]  Like,
[2973.88 --> 2974.44]  super,
[2974.58 --> 2975.60]  super strongly.
[2975.96 --> 2977.80]  So I'm tweeting out this thread on the forum,
[2977.90 --> 2978.16]  guys.
[2978.26 --> 2980.14]  This was posted by Mac on the forum.
[2980.26 --> 2981.90]  Thank you very much for submitting this topic.
[2982.32 --> 2982.58]  Guys,
[2982.64 --> 2982.90]  remember,
[2983.02 --> 2985.06]  you can have a chance to be featured on the WAN show,
[2985.14 --> 2986.48]  which basically makes you a celebrity.
[2986.70 --> 2986.84]  Oh,
[2986.88 --> 2986.98]  yeah.
[2987.04 --> 2989.42]  If you post in the news section of the Linus Tech Tips forum.
[2990.10 --> 2990.50]  So,
[2990.86 --> 2993.02]  for a while,
[2993.02 --> 2993.80]  I guess the video,
[2993.92 --> 2994.04]  oh,
[2994.10 --> 2994.48]  you know what?
[2994.54 --> 2997.06]  It might still be set to private because sometimes the thumbnails load.
[2997.14 --> 2997.20]  Yeah,
[2997.24 --> 2998.46]  the video is set to private now.
[2998.46 --> 2999.94]  So ad block,
[3000.38 --> 3000.86]  you know what?
[3000.92 --> 3001.04]  Here,
[3001.24 --> 3001.44]  go.
[3001.74 --> 3002.62]  When I checked it,
[3002.66 --> 3005.24]  the video was set to private and the website was not loading.
[3005.54 --> 3007.64]  So I actually don't know a lot about the campaign,
[3007.74 --> 3010.08]  other than the fact that ad block was buying ads,
[3010.14 --> 3011.46]  which is ridiculous.
[3011.60 --> 3013.34]  So they're buying ads for ad block.
[3013.54 --> 3022.96]  They wanted to crowd fund the concept of them buying up ad space so that ads
[3022.96 --> 3024.88]  wouldn't be able to be in it.
[3025.58 --> 3027.52]  And it sounds noble at first,
[3027.52 --> 3027.98]  but hold on.
[3027.98 --> 3031.00]  So they even wanted to crowd fund something like a Super Bowl ad.
[3031.36 --> 3032.44]  And I'm kind of looking at it going,
[3032.56 --> 3032.68]  okay,
[3032.80 --> 3032.98]  well,
[3033.10 --> 3033.26]  A,
[3033.30 --> 3034.52]  that's insane because.
[3034.94 --> 3035.92]  That's a lot of money.
[3035.94 --> 3036.58]  That's a lot of money.
[3036.66 --> 3037.12]  But B,
[3037.34 --> 3040.94]  the people who feel really strongly about ad block and that the internet should be
[3040.94 --> 3045.14]  ad free might be willing to pony up for that kind of a utopian future.
[3045.36 --> 3048.72]  And they also need to get on the reality train because it ain't going to happen.
[3049.16 --> 3052.54]  The internet would shut down tomorrow if ads didn't exist on the internet.
[3052.60 --> 3053.68]  Mark my words.
[3053.68 --> 3056.50]  If these guys are buying space so that it can be empty,
[3056.90 --> 3059.40]  they'll just run out of money and then it won't matter.
[3059.60 --> 3059.84]  Yes.
[3060.08 --> 3063.32]  The internet will keep being supported by ads.
[3063.44 --> 3064.80]  And you know what the reality of it is,
[3064.84 --> 3067.82]  is creators like us do rely on ads.
[3068.20 --> 3068.56]  I mean,
[3068.66 --> 3069.10]  you know what?
[3069.10 --> 3074.30]  I think this is a great time to give a huge shout out to the forum for all the support they gave us to the first blood campaign.
[3074.92 --> 3075.16]  I mean,
[3075.28 --> 3078.90]  I think some people thought that we weren't going to talk about how much money we've taken in.
[3078.96 --> 3081.14]  We've taken in over $11,000 already.
[3081.56 --> 3083.36]  You guys have been absolutely amazing.
[3083.88 --> 3085.18]  And I feel like,
[3085.26 --> 3085.46]  you know,
[3085.50 --> 3088.76]  we want to be accountable to you guys about what we're going to use the money for.
[3089.10 --> 3095.60]  So probably anywhere from half to two thirds of it is going to retroactively cover everything we've spent on the forum up till now.
[3095.66 --> 3096.48]  It has been a lot.
[3096.48 --> 3097.42]  It has been a lot.
[3097.70 --> 3103.48]  And then some of the other stuff is going to be used to allocate towards some new backend software we need in order to,
[3103.92 --> 3108.72]  I think what we need an encrypted backend thing that's like $600 a year or something stupid like that.
[3108.98 --> 3109.72]  It's round.
[3109.96 --> 3113.00]  I'm hopefully trying to work on one that's less than $600 a year,
[3113.08 --> 3113.38]  but it's,
[3113.38 --> 3114.44]  it's a lot encrypted backend.
[3114.52 --> 3117.30]  We need some new modules for the forum that are pay modules.
[3117.56 --> 3119.82]  We've relied on a lot of free ones and a lot of,
[3119.86 --> 3120.04]  you know,
[3120.08 --> 3122.32]  really generous people to help us keep things going.
[3122.62 --> 3125.56]  We want to be able to pay generous people who have helped us keep things going.
[3125.56 --> 3130.82]  So wind speed has been actually paying out of his own pocket to host that forum for a long time.
[3130.94 --> 3135.76]  We want to pay him back so that like we can actually be self-sustaining.
[3135.96 --> 3136.42]  And I mean,
[3136.46 --> 3139.40]  the community's response to that has been absolutely amazing.
[3139.40 --> 3145.56]  But what I need to throw in there is that $11,000 is a lot of money,
[3146.10 --> 3151.36]  but it's not because $11,000 is going to pay for all that stuff.
[3151.66 --> 3156.32]  And then at some point we're going to need to run another campaign and the forum's going to need to keep bringing in money.
[3156.52 --> 3161.86]  And that doesn't even actually pay for any of the salaries of any of the people who are working on it.
[3161.86 --> 3162.30]  No,
[3162.42 --> 3163.64]  we didn't factor it in.
[3163.98 --> 3164.16]  No.
[3164.68 --> 3172.62]  So it is extremely expensive to have people and staff and make videos and,
[3172.62 --> 3173.52]  uh,
[3173.56 --> 3177.20]  and buy equipment and have a place to do it and all of those things.
[3177.20 --> 3179.18]  And we rely on ads in a big way,
[3179.24 --> 3181.42]  whether it's something that we're integrating in the video,
[3181.48 --> 3182.98]  like the sponsorship from Razor comms,
[3183.02 --> 3183.48]  which by the way,
[3183.56 --> 3184.70]  download using the bitly link.
[3184.70 --> 3186.40]  It helps us out a lot.
[3186.96 --> 3188.92]  Don't know how to say that in a way that can be more clear.
[3189.52 --> 3189.88]  Um,
[3190.04 --> 3191.32]  whether it's,
[3191.40 --> 3194.48]  whether it's through that or whether it's through Google ads or whatever else the case may be,
[3194.54 --> 3196.82]  if the internet didn't have ads tomorrow,
[3196.82 --> 3202.44]  if ad block became a hundred percent effective and it could even block me talking about this right now,
[3202.84 --> 3209.92]  I would run out of money and any creator would not be able to create unless they also had a day job,
[3210.02 --> 3212.30]  which I really feel would hurt the quality of the content.
[3212.30 --> 3214.58]  I like to believe that what we've,
[3214.58 --> 3223.82]  produced since I was no longer at NCIX is better than what I was able to make when it was just like me with a chess tripod in a corner of my house in the attic,
[3224.00 --> 3227.60]  trying to make a video and not fall asleep while I was trying to make it.
[3227.64 --> 3231.52]  Cause I had to be at work the next morning and I had only just gotten back home from work an hour ago.
[3232.06 --> 3233.54]  So there you go guys.
[3233.76 --> 3234.22]  It's honestly,
[3234.34 --> 3238.82]  this campaign makes no sense because they're paying for the ad and it's temporary.
[3238.82 --> 3240.90]  They're not buying out ad space.
[3240.90 --> 3241.12]  Yeah.
[3241.26 --> 3242.58]  Ad block needs to screw right off.
[3242.80 --> 3243.56]  So there you go.
[3244.58 --> 3245.02]  Um,
[3245.30 --> 3245.98]  with that said,
[3246.06 --> 3247.16]  if you feel very,
[3247.28 --> 3249.50]  very strongly that you absolutely must have ad block,
[3249.62 --> 3250.00]  obvious,
[3250.12 --> 3251.80]  obviously there's nothing I can do to stop you,
[3251.88 --> 3253.88]  but I do thank the people who don't use it.
[3253.88 --> 3254.90]  And I mean,
[3254.90 --> 3257.00]  I know there's some people that do use it on the forum,
[3257.08 --> 3257.56]  for example,
[3257.56 --> 3259.04]  and contributed to first blood.
[3259.54 --> 3262.02]  If that's the compromise that works for you guys,
[3262.02 --> 3265.50]  then as long as we're finding a way to stay in business,
[3265.50 --> 3265.84]  then,
[3265.96 --> 3266.24]  you know,
[3266.28 --> 3266.96]  we're okay.
[3266.96 --> 3268.48]  But if there were no ads,
[3268.60 --> 3269.62]  that's my whole point.
[3269.96 --> 3272.06]  That future of the internet doesn't exist.
[3272.16 --> 3273.16]  We want to make a makeup channel.
[3273.74 --> 3274.22]  Makeup channel.
[3274.22 --> 3274.90]  No one uses ad block.
[3275.38 --> 3275.92]  I know,
[3275.98 --> 3276.14]  right?
[3276.22 --> 3276.94]  The best.
[3277.14 --> 3277.28]  Yeah.
[3277.28 --> 3278.84]  All the like least tech savvy.
[3278.94 --> 3279.04]  Yeah.
[3279.10 --> 3279.34]  That's,
[3279.38 --> 3280.12]  that's what we're going to do.
[3280.32 --> 3280.58]  You know,
[3280.62 --> 3284.00]  we're going to abandon technology because you guys are all too tech savvy for us.
[3284.00 --> 3285.88]  Um,
[3286.38 --> 3287.08]  this is awesome.
[3287.32 --> 3293.92]  Battlefield four runs at seven 20 P upscaled to 10 ADP on PlayStation four.
[3294.06 --> 3295.34]  I'm going to tweet this out.
[3295.54 --> 3295.80]  Go.
[3296.34 --> 3297.16]  So yeah,
[3297.28 --> 3300.58]  upscaled to 10 ADP runs at seven 20 P runs at 60 FPS though.
[3300.74 --> 3302.40]  So it was a compromise.
[3302.68 --> 3304.58]  Apparently they could have done 10 ADP,
[3304.72 --> 3305.50]  but at 30 FPS.
[3306.72 --> 3308.56]  So they're doing the,
[3308.72 --> 3308.86]  Oh,
[3308.94 --> 3310.70]  but you want it to be smoother kind of thing,
[3310.82 --> 3312.58]  which compromising for consoles.
[3312.58 --> 3314.96]  Just always compromising for consoles.
[3315.82 --> 3316.30]  Um,
[3316.34 --> 3316.64]  I mean,
[3316.72 --> 3318.24]  basically my take on this is,
[3318.30 --> 3319.12]  are we really surprised?
[3319.22 --> 3319.40]  I mean,
[3319.42 --> 3319.84]  here's the,
[3319.84 --> 3328.52]  here's the crazy thing is everyone's talking 4k next gen consoles are talking seven 20 P on current games.
[3329.64 --> 3330.28]  I mean,
[3330.34 --> 3332.74]  battlefield four isn't even running a new frostbite engine.
[3334.92 --> 3336.14]  It's kind of pathetic.
[3336.42 --> 3337.42]  Like I was looking at that.
[3337.44 --> 3339.56]  Were you looking at battlefield four today running on the,
[3339.56 --> 3339.78]  uh,
[3339.78 --> 3341.26]  they weren't running on Xbox ones,
[3341.26 --> 3344.96]  but they were running on like kind of crappy PCs kind of thing.
[3345.12 --> 3346.44]  Wasn't it supposed to be simulated basically?
[3346.56 --> 3346.76]  Yeah.
[3346.90 --> 3347.14]  Yeah.
[3347.34 --> 3347.86]  It looked,
[3348.24 --> 3348.90]  I was like,
[3348.98 --> 3349.32]  Oh,
[3349.64 --> 3349.90]  okay.
[3349.98 --> 3351.70]  It looks like battlefield three.
[3351.90 --> 3352.10]  I,
[3352.10 --> 3352.36]  I,
[3352.42 --> 3355.48]  I actually did two takes of my whole thing in front of it.
[3355.60 --> 3356.86]  One of which was,
[3356.86 --> 3357.64]  um,
[3357.66 --> 3357.90]  okay.
[3357.90 --> 3361.62]  So it looks like consoles finally have battlefield three because,
[3361.88 --> 3362.06]  uh,
[3362.06 --> 3364.68]  the last time I saw battlefield three being played on a console,
[3364.68 --> 3366.10]  it was on an Xbox three 60.
[3366.24 --> 3366.98]  And I was like,
[3366.98 --> 3367.86]  I was looking at it going like,
[3367.86 --> 3368.96]  what is that counter strike?
[3369.28 --> 3371.52]  Cause I had never seen it run on a console before.
[3371.60 --> 3372.82]  I'd only seen it on a PC.
[3373.00 --> 3373.56]  And I was like,
[3373.60 --> 3374.16]  now it looks like,
[3374.22 --> 3374.34]  Hey,
[3374.38 --> 3374.56]  they're,
[3374.62 --> 3375.54]  they're finally catching up.
[3375.56 --> 3376.56]  But what's that alias thing?
[3377.96 --> 3378.52]  And like,
[3378.54 --> 3378.78]  Oh,
[3378.82 --> 3379.82]  frame rates on everything.
[3379.92 --> 3382.24]  I was watching people playing racing games and I was just like,
[3382.34 --> 3382.74]  Ooh,
[3383.18 --> 3383.80]  it's disgusting.
[3384.00 --> 3385.08]  Racing games at 3d FPS.
[3385.26 --> 3386.06]  Are you freaking kidding me?
[3386.50 --> 3388.78]  Steambox people build your own steambox.
[3388.92 --> 3389.26]  And like,
[3389.40 --> 3389.80]  and like,
[3389.80 --> 3390.02]  okay.
[3390.02 --> 3390.28]  I was,
[3390.34 --> 3392.40]  I was making fun of a Forza as well.
[3392.40 --> 3393.04]  Cause I was like,
[3393.10 --> 3393.34]  Oh,
[3393.34 --> 3394.02]  check that out.
[3394.02 --> 3396.10]  It's got great graphics just like we've had for years.
[3396.46 --> 3396.82]  Oh,
[3396.90 --> 3397.02]  Hey,
[3397.06 --> 3397.52]  check that out.
[3397.56 --> 3399.50]  It's got like surround sound around like a cool,
[3399.58 --> 3400.62]  like car driving seat.
[3400.68 --> 3401.88]  That's modded into a display.
[3402.02 --> 3403.82]  Just like PC has been having for years.
[3404.00 --> 3404.30]  Oh,
[3404.36 --> 3404.50]  Hey,
[3404.50 --> 3404.68]  look,
[3404.74 --> 3407.02]  they have surround monitors just like PC's had for you.
[3407.10 --> 3407.38]  Oh wait,
[3407.44 --> 3407.52]  no,
[3407.54 --> 3408.12]  they don't.
[3409.46 --> 3410.44]  That's not a thing.
[3413.42 --> 3413.78]  Yes.
[3414.66 --> 3415.58]  This is kind of brutal.
[3415.98 --> 3416.78]  I know.
[3417.00 --> 3417.60]  I know.
[3417.60 --> 3420.14]  You can do surround monitors on consoles,
[3420.28 --> 3421.34]  but you need multiple consoles.
[3421.64 --> 3422.88]  They can talk to each other.
[3422.88 --> 3424.60]  That is such a joke.
[3424.68 --> 3424.80]  Dude,
[3424.88 --> 3425.04]  just,
[3425.14 --> 3426.02]  just buy more consoles.
[3426.02 --> 3426.40]  You know what?
[3426.44 --> 3426.90]  This is a,
[3427.02 --> 3429.50]  this is the lecture I gave at the meetup today at PAX,
[3429.66 --> 3430.28]  uh,
[3430.28 --> 3432.78]  where I had probably about eight people who I hope heard me.
[3433.26 --> 3435.78]  You don't have to buy new PC hardware.
[3436.40 --> 3437.68]  I'm gonna let that sink in for a minute.
[3439.78 --> 3441.42]  Go buy a 5870.
[3441.82 --> 3442.74]  They're cheap.
[3443.08 --> 3445.26]  You can get those things cheap.
[3445.44 --> 3446.70]  Used maybe 50 bucks,
[3446.82 --> 3447.60]  60 bucks.
[3447.74 --> 3449.40]  That is a very capable card.
[3449.74 --> 3451.02]  It is affinity capable.
[3451.02 --> 3455.24]  You can pick up non TN monitors these days for a hundred dollars,
[3455.34 --> 3456.26]  less than a hundred dollars.
[3456.46 --> 3458.08]  So for a few hundred bucks,
[3458.38 --> 3461.08]  you throw that card into whatever PC you're running.
[3461.26 --> 3462.58]  You throw a few monitors on it.
[3462.64 --> 3463.10]  Holy crap.
[3463.26 --> 3466.32]  What a gaming experience you have that cannot be replicated on a console.
[3467.52 --> 3467.96]  Like,
[3468.18 --> 3469.08]  this is,
[3469.14 --> 3471.12]  this is a big thing in the whole discussion.
[3471.12 --> 3471.52]  We're like,
[3471.56 --> 3471.70]  Oh,
[3471.72 --> 3472.70]  you can't build a computer.
[3472.86 --> 3473.34]  It's cheap.
[3473.40 --> 3473.68]  It's like,
[3473.76 --> 3474.02]  yeah,
[3474.56 --> 3476.70]  that's possibly true.
[3477.42 --> 3477.82]  Possibly.
[3477.82 --> 3480.70]  You can if you go through other means.
[3480.88 --> 3481.06]  Yes.
[3481.84 --> 3482.42]  You know what?
[3482.50 --> 3483.08]  Where there's a will,
[3483.16 --> 3483.56]  there's a way.
[3483.66 --> 3489.26]  It is possible to build a PC that is competitive with a console or better and is as cheap or cheaper than a console.
[3489.70 --> 3493.42]  $500 is a lot of money and that's what Microsoft's asking for Xbox One.
[3493.76 --> 3494.16]  So yeah,
[3494.24 --> 3498.42]  I can't like flail my hands around in front of that PC and expect it to do anything.
[3498.42 --> 3499.24]  But quite frankly,
[3499.36 --> 3501.34]  with the experience I've had with Kinect in the past,
[3501.44 --> 3501.62]  I don't,
[3501.76 --> 3503.00]  I'm not expecting it to do much anyway.
[3503.62 --> 3507.12]  They had some Kinect demo that they were showing off today with Xbox One.
[3507.22 --> 3507.60]  And like,
[3507.70 --> 3511.62]  the whole demo was just like a character customization screen.
[3511.70 --> 3512.96]  So we eventually walked away from it.
[3513.00 --> 3513.82]  It was just kind of stupid.
[3514.44 --> 3514.74]  Anyway,
[3514.88 --> 3516.38]  we've tweeted out another topic.
[3516.48 --> 3520.36]  I want to make sure we cover all of our headline topics because we notoriously do that.
[3520.58 --> 3520.70]  Yeah.
[3520.82 --> 3521.12]  We're like,
[3521.20 --> 3521.40]  yeah,
[3521.50 --> 3522.62]  upcoming on the WAN show.
[3522.78 --> 3524.20]  Things we're not going to talk about after all.
[3524.20 --> 3531.92]  So Nvidia is rumored to be releasing a dual GK110 graphics card.
[3532.12 --> 3534.64]  So these chips are going to have to be pretty drawn back,
[3534.74 --> 3534.96]  I think.
[3535.66 --> 3536.20]  I disagree.
[3537.30 --> 3537.86]  And I'm going to,
[3537.92 --> 3538.12]  hold on,
[3538.18 --> 3539.22]  I'm going somewhere with this.
[3539.56 --> 3539.76]  Okay.
[3539.86 --> 3544.20]  So AMD has exceeded the PCI Express spec already with 7990.
[3544.92 --> 3546.66]  So the precedent's been set.
[3547.42 --> 3547.74]  Okay.
[3547.94 --> 3548.30]  Whatever.
[3548.90 --> 3549.20]  Screw specifications.
[3550.06 --> 3551.24]  Apparently it's game over for that.
[3551.24 --> 3552.16]  Um,
[3552.96 --> 3554.22]  so this would be,
[3554.40 --> 3554.60]  you know,
[3554.66 --> 3556.14]  the two graphics cards are supposedly,
[3556.34 --> 3557.44]  so there's supposedly,
[3557.70 --> 3558.94]  according to videocards.com,
[3559.24 --> 3560.56]  a couple of graphics cards.
[3560.62 --> 3563.82]  So a GTX Titan Ultra and a supposed GTX 790.
[3564.02 --> 3567.26]  The rumor is that GTX 790 won't be more than a thousand dollars.
[3567.76 --> 3568.16]  Um,
[3568.40 --> 3570.30]  they say making such a graphics card might be a challenge,
[3570.42 --> 3570.60]  et cetera,
[3570.68 --> 3570.84]  et cetera,
[3570.88 --> 3571.04]  et cetera,
[3571.04 --> 3571.18]  et cetera.
[3571.18 --> 3571.38]  Okay.
[3571.74 --> 3573.14]  They're already making,
[3573.14 --> 3574.30]  uh,
[3574.42 --> 3578.96]  boards for Nvidia grid that have four GK110s on them.
[3578.96 --> 3582.66]  So they clearly have the technology,
[3582.78 --> 3583.28]  so to speak.
[3583.62 --> 3584.32]  What is that?
[3584.38 --> 3584.74]  And,
[3584.82 --> 3585.12]  uh,
[3585.76 --> 3585.98]  oh,
[3586.10 --> 3586.32]  ha,
[3586.32 --> 3586.58]  ha,
[3586.58 --> 3586.82]  ha,
[3586.82 --> 3586.90]  ha,
[3586.90 --> 3587.08]  ha,
[3587.14 --> 3588.14]  wind speed says,
[3588.20 --> 3588.38]  uh,
[3588.38 --> 3590.62]  when new consoles cost a thousand dollars in Australia,
[3590.86 --> 3594.06]  you can definitely buy a new PC for the cost of a console.
[3594.44 --> 3594.84]  Anyway,
[3595.02 --> 3596.10]  if they can do that,
[3596.26 --> 3597.40]  then I think it's doable.
[3597.52 --> 3601.28]  If they could build GTX 295 with the technology they had then,
[3601.28 --> 3603.00]  that was a very power hungry chip.
[3603.00 --> 3603.30]  I'm just,
[3603.40 --> 3604.90]  the only reason why I said draw back was,
[3605.06 --> 3606.46]  I shouldn't have said drawing back chips.
[3606.80 --> 3608.66]  VRM later on that is going to be ridiculous.
[3608.66 --> 3608.94]  Yeah,
[3608.96 --> 3609.56]  it'll be ridiculous.
[3609.96 --> 3610.06]  But,
[3610.16 --> 3610.52]  uh,
[3610.58 --> 3611.06]  Radeon,
[3611.20 --> 3611.38]  uh,
[3611.38 --> 3614.16]  HD 7990 was ridiculous as well.
[3614.26 --> 3614.60]  And I mean,
[3615.04 --> 3619.28]  Nvidia does such a great job of the electrical design of their cards.
[3619.40 --> 3620.98]  They never coil wind for the most part.
[3621.28 --> 3622.72]  They've done a great job of cooling.
[3622.80 --> 3622.94]  I mean,
[3622.96 --> 3626.76]  you look at something like GTX Titan or GTX 690,
[3627.02 --> 3630.22]  how quiet those cards are.
[3630.34 --> 3630.54]  Yeah.
[3630.72 --> 3631.54]  If they kind of went,
[3631.72 --> 3632.02]  okay,
[3632.12 --> 3632.36]  well,
[3632.46 --> 3632.74]  okay,
[3632.80 --> 3634.36]  let's let it make a little bit of noise.
[3634.72 --> 3635.86]  Could they cool the thing?
[3635.94 --> 3636.56]  I think so.
[3637.10 --> 3638.50]  Could they make the board longer?
[3638.66 --> 3638.94]  I mean,
[3638.94 --> 3639.28]  remember,
[3639.46 --> 3643.14]  it wasn't that long ago that graphics cards were getting longer and longer every generation.
[3643.80 --> 3644.12]  Many,
[3644.44 --> 3644.64]  I mean,
[3644.68 --> 3649.08]  I would go as far as to say most gaming cases these days can accommodate a 12 inch card,
[3649.42 --> 3649.94]  30 centimeters.
[3649.94 --> 3651.14]  It used to be a big problem though.
[3651.16 --> 3652.06]  It used to be a big problem,
[3652.16 --> 3652.56]  but I mean,
[3653.00 --> 3654.00]  it's evolved since then.
[3654.14 --> 3659.74]  How many gaming cases these days have removable hard drive cages that you could put a 15 inch graphics card in it?
[3659.74 --> 3661.04]  And if Nvidia is going to say,
[3661.12 --> 3661.22]  look,
[3661.26 --> 3662.88]  it's a thousand dollar graphics card.
[3663.16 --> 3663.70]  Buy a damn case.
[3663.70 --> 3664.08]  You know what?
[3664.46 --> 3668.34]  You can get a Corsair 300R for less than a hundred dollars.
[3668.58 --> 3673.38]  Go buy a case if you want to have this unbelievable gaming experience.
[3673.38 --> 3674.42]  So,
[3674.66 --> 3675.02]  I don't know.
[3675.14 --> 3675.42]  I don't,
[3675.50 --> 3675.76]  I don't,
[3675.90 --> 3676.00]  I,
[3676.16 --> 3676.40]  you know,
[3676.42 --> 3679.34]  what's funny is I talked to Nvidia today and they were basically like,
[3679.46 --> 3680.08]  come on,
[3680.12 --> 3680.36]  man.
[3681.04 --> 3681.54]  And I was like,
[3681.64 --> 3682.48]  come on.
[3682.64 --> 3683.20]  And they were like,
[3683.42 --> 3683.82]  come on,
[3683.88 --> 3684.10]  man.
[3684.20 --> 3684.38]  You know,
[3684.38 --> 3684.64]  you know,
[3684.64 --> 3684.66]  you know,
[3684.66 --> 3685.28]  we can't talk less.
[3685.38 --> 3685.64]  I'm like,
[3685.68 --> 3686.52]  come on.
[3686.52 --> 3688.54]  I got nothing.
[3688.88 --> 3689.78]  You know what I did get though?
[3689.88 --> 3691.20]  I got a carrying case for my shield.
[3691.68 --> 3691.84]  Really?
[3691.94 --> 3692.12]  Yeah.
[3692.14 --> 3694.48]  They were selling them in the booth and I was like,
[3694.62 --> 3695.14]  yo dog.
[3697.60 --> 3699.42]  It was like a big problem.
[3699.56 --> 3700.72]  It took like 15 minutes.
[3701.92 --> 3702.76]  Which were they?
[3702.90 --> 3703.58]  30 bucks.
[3703.90 --> 3706.00]  I should have just bought one because I felt terrible.
[3706.00 --> 3709.98]  The amount of time I wasted of people who I know make six figures.
[3709.98 --> 3712.16]  I was like,
[3712.34 --> 3712.90]  oops.
[3715.38 --> 3719.20]  Cause like they had to go get someone who had to go check with the person
[3719.20 --> 3723.44]  overseeing the entire booth who had to go and override something in their
[3723.44 --> 3726.10]  system because they had like an inventory system.
[3726.18 --> 3726.56]  I was like,
[3727.06 --> 3727.30]  yeah,
[3727.38 --> 3729.04]  I feel really bad about this.
[3729.04 --> 3730.46]  Cause like my PR guy was like,
[3730.48 --> 3730.58]  yeah,
[3730.58 --> 3731.24]  we'll just send you one.
[3731.26 --> 3731.58]  I was like,
[3731.64 --> 3731.80]  dude,
[3731.84 --> 3734.62]  it's going to cost you like 40 bucks to ship me that to Canada.
[3734.72 --> 3735.48]  Remember I'm in Canada.
[3735.58 --> 3735.86]  He's like,
[3735.88 --> 3736.26]  oh yeah,
[3737.00 --> 3737.44]  crap.
[3737.58 --> 3737.84]  Okay.
[3738.02 --> 3739.10]  I'll see if I can do it.
[3739.10 --> 3740.18]  I was like,
[3740.22 --> 3740.64]  thank you.
[3740.78 --> 3741.84]  It's so nice.
[3742.64 --> 3743.72]  It's really nice.
[3743.92 --> 3744.46]  I want a shield,
[3744.68 --> 3745.60]  but I can't.
[3746.12 --> 3746.88]  We got the,
[3747.00 --> 3750.08]  I had a bit of a problem with the buttons on my first shield sample.
[3750.24 --> 3751.60]  I know it's the new ones way better.
[3752.08 --> 3752.40]  Have you,
[3752.46 --> 3753.00]  you've tried it?
[3753.08 --> 3753.32]  Yeah.
[3753.52 --> 3753.88]  Oh,
[3753.88 --> 3754.46]  it's way better.
[3754.64 --> 3758.60]  I took it out of the box because I wanted to ship the other one in the box because
[3758.60 --> 3759.54]  I had to ship the other one back.
[3759.60 --> 3759.72]  Right.
[3759.80 --> 3760.04]  Yeah.
[3760.12 --> 3761.20]  And when I took it out of the box,
[3761.26 --> 3761.48]  it's like,
[3761.54 --> 3762.48]  I want to try it,
[3762.64 --> 3763.06]  but no,
[3763.20 --> 3764.04]  I don't have time.
[3765.30 --> 3766.02]  Put it down.
[3766.12 --> 3766.26]  Oh,
[3766.30 --> 3766.94]  it's so awesome.
[3767.26 --> 3768.26]  When I'm done the review,
[3768.26 --> 3769.64]  you can play around with it for a bit.
[3769.80 --> 3770.04]  Sweet.
[3770.40 --> 3772.52]  And then you can decide it because you're going to buy one,
[3772.56 --> 3772.72]  right?
[3772.96 --> 3773.52]  That's your plan.
[3773.66 --> 3774.52]  I can't now.
[3774.78 --> 3774.96]  Oh,
[3774.96 --> 3775.08]  right.
[3775.12 --> 3775.66]  You got a car.
[3775.86 --> 3776.04]  Oh,
[3776.58 --> 3778.18]  but I do want to at some point.
[3778.46 --> 3778.88]  All right.
[3778.96 --> 3779.22]  Let's,
[3779.46 --> 3779.84]  I don't know.
[3779.90 --> 3782.78]  Let's maybe pick like two or three more topics and then maybe I can get you back for half
[3782.78 --> 3783.28]  an hour of gaming.
[3783.54 --> 3783.82]  Sure.
[3783.96 --> 3784.52]  I'm sorry.
[3784.76 --> 3786.24]  I feel terrible about this guys.
[3786.32 --> 3788.16]  It took us forever to get the stream set up today.
[3788.26 --> 3793.66]  I'm more sad for the huge group of people that I've dragged along with me.
[3793.66 --> 3794.68]  I blame Comcast.
[3795.96 --> 3796.28]  Although,
[3796.40 --> 3796.66]  you know what?
[3796.70 --> 3799.72]  Maybe I should just back off on blaming ISPs for things for a while.
[3801.52 --> 3801.88]  Yeah.
[3802.78 --> 3803.14]  Maybe.
[3803.66 --> 3807.74]  It was just a horrible timing because Shaw said they were barring us that one weekend.
[3807.74 --> 3807.98]  Guys,
[3808.08 --> 3808.92]  hit us up on Twitter.
[3809.04 --> 3810.42]  We want to do a Twitter blitz here.
[3810.58 --> 3812.36]  Just hit us with some random Q&A.
[3812.76 --> 3813.26]  And you know what?
[3813.32 --> 3815.82]  I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who's watching.
[3815.94 --> 3816.74]  We have 2,700 viewers.
[3817.70 --> 3817.86]  Nice guys.
[3817.86 --> 3823.04]  In spite of the fact that we are streaming at completely the wrong time of day.
[3823.34 --> 3823.52]  You know,
[3823.54 --> 3825.82]  we were supposed to have Marcus Brownlee on as our guest today.
[3826.06 --> 3826.30]  Really?
[3826.42 --> 3829.92]  But when I realized that it just...
[3829.92 --> 3830.60]  Is he East Coast?
[3830.68 --> 3831.30]  He's East Coast.
[3831.42 --> 3832.02]  Oh, no.
[3832.06 --> 3834.02]  So it just wouldn't have worked at all.
[3834.56 --> 3834.96]  Although,
[3835.10 --> 3837.46]  I'm hoping to make an appearance on the tech at some point.
[3837.78 --> 3839.62]  And I'm hoping to appear in a Perillo vlog.
[3840.04 --> 3840.82]  Because everyone's here.
[3841.40 --> 3841.98]  Everybody's here.
[3842.16 --> 3844.12]  So it's going to be fun over the next couple days.
[3844.22 --> 3845.50]  I'm going to try and find some time for that.
[3845.60 --> 3845.80]  Awesome.
[3845.80 --> 3847.74]  But thank you guys so much for watching.
[3847.96 --> 3849.16]  And we're sorry it's at the wrong time.
[3849.22 --> 3851.08]  We're going to be back to the regular schedule next week.
[3851.32 --> 3853.04]  Our guest next week is Tiny Tom Logan.
[3853.18 --> 3856.26]  And our guest the week after that is Marcus Brownlee from MKBHD.
[3856.62 --> 3858.96]  So we've got some really good guests coming up.
[3859.00 --> 3860.14]  I think you guys are going to love it.
[3860.90 --> 3861.20]  So,
[3861.36 --> 3863.50]  here we go.
[3863.80 --> 3864.20]  Topic.
[3866.16 --> 3869.58]  EVGA has a mini ITX Hadron case with an integrated PSU.
[3869.58 --> 3870.52]  Looks really sharp.
[3871.30 --> 3875.76]  Siri apparently responds snarkily when asked to talk about Google.
[3875.80 --> 3876.40]  Glass.
[3878.08 --> 3879.08]  Your comment is,
[3879.18 --> 3880.22]  would this have happened under Jobs?
[3880.32 --> 3880.76]  Absolutely.
[3881.64 --> 3881.92]  Yes.
[3882.12 --> 3883.14]  But I said that.
[3883.24 --> 3884.82]  But Jobs would have had a response.
[3885.96 --> 3886.66]  Ah, I see.
[3886.66 --> 3887.70]  That's the second line there.
[3887.78 --> 3889.16]  There would have been an answer.
[3889.94 --> 3891.50]  It wouldn't have just been like,
[3891.56 --> 3891.94]  oh, yeah,
[3892.08 --> 3893.18]  Glass sucks.
[3893.42 --> 3894.06]  It would have been like,
[3894.08 --> 3894.22]  yeah,
[3894.30 --> 3895.02]  Glass sucks.
[3895.86 --> 3896.90]  Here's an alternative.
[3897.32 --> 3900.22]  Or we're developing this because that Glass thing isn't ready yet.
[3900.22 --> 3901.64]  But we're going to have something that's awesome.
[3901.72 --> 3903.10]  So here's some of the snarky responses.
[3903.22 --> 3905.16]  I just tweeted out the thread from Top Wargamer.
[3905.86 --> 3906.48]  I, uh,
[3906.54 --> 3909.12]  I think that Glass is half empty, Dan.
[3909.60 --> 3911.54]  Stop trying to strap me to your forehead, Dan.
[3911.60 --> 3912.34]  It won't work.
[3913.00 --> 3913.42]  Um,
[3913.54 --> 3913.86]  Glass.
[3914.12 --> 3915.82]  I think you've got the wrong assistant, Dan.
[3916.62 --> 3917.40]  I'm not Glass,
[3917.48 --> 3918.64]  and I'm just fine with that.
[3918.64 --> 3920.00]  So these are,
[3920.08 --> 3922.48]  these are some examples of some of the things Siri might,
[3922.58 --> 3924.90]  might say if asked about Google Glass.
[3925.12 --> 3925.64]  I don't know.
[3925.68 --> 3926.60]  I don't think it's that funny.
[3927.12 --> 3927.24]  I,
[3927.40 --> 3928.52]  they're,
[3928.56 --> 3929.38]  they're not that funny.
[3929.70 --> 3929.94]  Yeah.
[3930.32 --> 3931.58]  If they were really funny,
[3931.76 --> 3932.82]  I think it'd be way better.
[3933.00 --> 3933.08]  Again,
[3933.08 --> 3935.20]  it probably would be really funny if it was under Jobs.
[3935.78 --> 3939.30]  Because he probably wouldn't have let it come out if it was just kind of weird and lame.
[3939.52 --> 3942.44]  Lenovo's going to start shipping an aftermarket start menu with their PCs.
[3942.88 --> 3943.68]  This is interesting.
[3943.80 --> 3944.58]  What a kick in the,
[3944.64 --> 3946.36]  what a kick in the balls for Microsoft.
[3946.60 --> 3947.48]  Just do something.
[3947.52 --> 3947.92]  It's like,
[3948.02 --> 3948.16]  yeah,
[3948.26 --> 3948.96]  your concept,
[3949.14 --> 3949.80]  we don't like it.
[3950.08 --> 3950.72]  Because it sucks.
[3950.76 --> 3951.34]  And you know what's,
[3951.40 --> 3951.90]  you know what's,
[3951.92 --> 3953.08]  you know what's something that I,
[3953.24 --> 3954.80]  I actually feel kind of bad about this.
[3954.86 --> 3955.40]  Because I,
[3955.52 --> 3955.94]  I don't know,
[3956.06 --> 3956.68]  you know this.
[3956.74 --> 3957.26]  I was the,
[3957.32 --> 3959.76]  I was the head of PC systems when I was at NCIX.
[3960.28 --> 3966.24]  So the decision for whether or not to just install a start menu on every Windows 8 PC that,
[3966.24 --> 3967.20]  that we shipped,
[3967.56 --> 3967.84]  I,
[3967.90 --> 3968.56]  I nixed it.
[3968.98 --> 3969.58]  I said no.
[3970.12 --> 3970.48]  Because,
[3970.90 --> 3971.26]  uh,
[3971.32 --> 3973.32]  I had concerns about the EULA.
[3974.20 --> 3974.68]  Um,
[3974.68 --> 3976.36]  I had concerns about,
[3976.72 --> 3976.98]  you know,
[3977.04 --> 3979.62]  getting proper licensing in place for the start menu.
[3980.14 --> 3980.40]  Um,
[3980.44 --> 3984.44]  NCIX compared to Lenovo is a relatively small fry.
[3984.64 --> 3991.90]  I had concerns about damaging the relationship with Microsoft by undermining the initiative that they were trying to do for better or for worse.
[3992.52 --> 3993.04]  Um,
[3993.80 --> 3996.52]  but now that Lenovo's kind of gone down that road,
[3996.52 --> 3998.38]  I think the others are going to fall.
[3998.38 --> 4001.10]  So you need that to defend your,
[4001.26 --> 4003.14]  I'm going to defend and not defend your position.
[4003.32 --> 4003.56]  One,
[4003.68 --> 4004.50]  it's really,
[4004.64 --> 4006.56]  really helpful to have that big guy do it first.
[4007.06 --> 4007.26]  Yes.
[4007.46 --> 4007.70]  Two,
[4007.80 --> 4011.98]  I think you could have avoided a lot of those issues if you didn't do it by default and had it as an option.
[4012.28 --> 4013.84]  Because if it's a user selected option,
[4013.90 --> 4015.02]  I think that opens a lot of doors.
[4015.38 --> 4015.98]  If it's a,
[4015.98 --> 4017.32]  but I mean a lot of,
[4017.36 --> 4018.72]  even free programs,
[4019.06 --> 4019.86]  a lot of them,
[4019.98 --> 4022.54]  the way that the licensing works is that you're,
[4022.66 --> 4024.02]  you're not allowed to,
[4024.02 --> 4024.58]  um,
[4024.78 --> 4026.30]  install it on behalf of someone else.
[4027.16 --> 4028.16]  That's a big problem.
[4028.28 --> 4028.54]  Okay.
[4028.96 --> 4030.78]  So it would have had to be a complicated deal.
[4030.86 --> 4038.16]  And I don't know that NCIX would have even gotten the kind of attention that someone like Lenovo would have for reaching out to a classic start or whoever else the case may be.
[4038.34 --> 4038.52]  So,
[4039.78 --> 4040.84]  yeah,
[4040.98 --> 4041.36]  I don't know.
[4041.42 --> 4042.86]  Like I felt kind of like I,
[4042.98 --> 4044.60]  I knew the right thing to do.
[4044.94 --> 4045.44]  It would be a lot of work.
[4045.60 --> 4046.74]  From a user perspective.
[4047.06 --> 4047.32]  Yeah.
[4047.76 --> 4049.12]  Was install it.
[4049.20 --> 4050.16]  But then on the other hand,
[4050.22 --> 4051.40]  what if it confuses people?
[4051.40 --> 4053.12]  What if they're not expecting to have a start menu?
[4053.30 --> 4053.78]  You'd have to,
[4053.82 --> 4054.90]  it would have to be user selected.
[4055.32 --> 4055.58]  Yeah.
[4055.84 --> 4057.08]  I don't think you could do it by default.
[4057.08 --> 4057.46]  I mean,
[4057.52 --> 4062.52]  I think what we ended up doing was we put an install file in the middle of the desktop.
[4062.76 --> 4063.02]  Okay.
[4063.76 --> 4064.06]  So,
[4064.18 --> 4064.34]  I mean,
[4064.40 --> 4064.74]  do you,
[4064.80 --> 4065.84]  do you think that's a good compromise?
[4066.02 --> 4066.90]  That's not a bad compromise.
[4067.16 --> 4070.08]  Maybe something you could have done is just had a mass copied notepad.
[4070.20 --> 4070.34]  Right.
[4070.34 --> 4071.20]  To explain what it was.
[4071.86 --> 4077.44]  So AMD has updated their roadmap to reflect 2014 market changes.
[4077.82 --> 4083.74]  So they are anticipating that they will be shipping 70% APUs.
[4083.74 --> 4085.04]  While CPUs,
[4085.08 --> 4085.94]  which to be clear,
[4086.30 --> 4087.58]  are kind of the same thing,
[4088.08 --> 4090.40]  but they don't have an onboard graphics core,
[4090.50 --> 4093.66]  are going to make up only 30% of sales in,
[4093.76 --> 4094.38]  I think,
[4094.46 --> 4094.94]  what are you saying?
[4095.00 --> 4095.92]  2014 here.
[4096.04 --> 4096.52]  So by the end,
[4096.58 --> 4096.98]  I don't know.
[4097.02 --> 4098.28]  Your dates are all mixed up on this.
[4098.28 --> 4101.12]  But the AM3 in 2014,
[4101.52 --> 4104.96]  AMD's AM3 socket will retire after five years.
[4105.36 --> 4106.80]  And I think they're counting AM2,
[4106.88 --> 4107.46]  AM2+,
[4107.46 --> 4107.84]  AM3,
[4107.92 --> 4108.44]  AM3+,
[4108.44 --> 4108.86]  or whatever,
[4108.94 --> 4109.44]  whatever it is.
[4109.46 --> 4109.62]  Anyway,
[4109.72 --> 4111.72]  that socket is going to retire.
[4112.26 --> 4112.60]  Now,
[4113.24 --> 4114.40]  with that said,
[4115.26 --> 4117.34]  APU is not necessarily a bad direction.
[4117.78 --> 4118.26]  No.
[4118.26 --> 4120.80]  particularly with the way that you look,
[4120.86 --> 4123.60]  you look at the way that applications like Adobe Premiere even,
[4123.90 --> 4129.54]  are going to leverage the CPU and the OpenCL capabilities of that processor.
[4129.54 --> 4131.40]  We could be looking at the potential.
[4132.02 --> 4132.22]  Oh,
[4132.26 --> 4134.60]  that no film school article from B-roll isn't in here.
[4135.90 --> 4137.96]  With the Mac mini built into the camera.
[4138.48 --> 4139.58]  That must not have synced.
[4139.64 --> 4139.86]  Okay,
[4139.94 --> 4140.26]  you know what?
[4140.28 --> 4141.42]  I tried to add that one while I was on it.
[4141.42 --> 4142.22]  We'll talk about it next week,
[4142.28 --> 4143.24]  because I want to wrap this up.
[4143.24 --> 4144.02]  But anyway,
[4144.32 --> 4146.80]  so AMD is just saying,
[4146.96 --> 4146.98]  well,
[4147.02 --> 4147.28]  no,
[4147.32 --> 4148.34]  it's a CPU with a graphics core,
[4148.40 --> 4149.60]  but the way that that's going to work,
[4149.88 --> 4159.30]  it might end up being more useful to have a quad or a six core CPU with an equally large graphics core that accelerates all the other things your computer does,
[4159.40 --> 4160.10]  and more efficiently.
[4161.00 --> 4161.40]  So,
[4161.88 --> 4162.16]  you know,
[4162.26 --> 4164.22]  I think a lot of people are looking at this going,
[4164.32 --> 4164.42]  well,
[4164.50 --> 4164.68]  okay,
[4164.74 --> 4166.94]  it's the death of enthusiast grade CPUs.
[4167.98 --> 4168.72]  Maybe not.
[4169.52 --> 4173.06]  What if a game engine could be optimized to leverage,
[4173.24 --> 4176.40]  your dedicated graphics card to actually draw the image on the screen,
[4176.96 --> 4179.36]  your CPU for AI,
[4180.10 --> 4184.02]  and your GPU component of your APU for,
[4184.20 --> 4184.48]  oh,
[4184.68 --> 4185.20]  I don't know,
[4185.34 --> 4187.34]  physics calculations or something along those lines.
[4187.60 --> 4189.38]  What if we just need to utilize it better?
[4189.72 --> 4190.66]  And the reality of it is,
[4190.68 --> 4192.26]  is it's not just AMD pushing this.
[4192.70 --> 4193.58]  Intel's Haswell,
[4194.38 --> 4195.38]  Intel's Haswell,
[4195.38 --> 4197.58]  Intel's Haswell,
[4197.80 --> 4199.78]  fourth generation core,
[4199.86 --> 4200.02]  whatever,
[4200.20 --> 4200.32]  okay,
[4200.82 --> 4201.84]  Haswell from Intel
[4201.84 --> 4202.76]  is,
[4203.18 --> 4206.14]  basically didn't do a whole lot to the CPU component,
[4206.26 --> 4208.60]  but they massively beefed up the GPU on there.
[4208.78 --> 4209.94]  From AMD's definition,
[4210.10 --> 4210.94]  that's an APU.
[4211.70 --> 4214.12]  It's also capable of the same kind of,
[4214.36 --> 4214.66]  like,
[4214.76 --> 4217.80]  heavily parallelized compute performance
[4217.80 --> 4220.66]  as AMD's solution.
[4220.66 --> 4221.40]  Yeah,
[4221.46 --> 4222.24]  and like you said,
[4222.26 --> 4223.92]  if they optimize different things for it,
[4223.94 --> 4224.92]  it makes a lot of sense.
[4225.04 --> 4228.54]  We're looking at a completely different way of building a CPU.
[4228.72 --> 4228.82]  I mean,
[4228.86 --> 4230.52]  APU could be the future.
[4230.52 --> 4231.46]  I can't remember the name of it.
[4231.46 --> 4231.60]  I mean,
[4231.60 --> 4231.98]  it is,
[4232.12 --> 4232.44]  actually.
[4232.58 --> 4232.74]  Yeah,
[4232.78 --> 4234.06]  I can't remember the name of it,
[4234.10 --> 4236.64]  but the thing they're saying PS4 has over Xbox.
[4237.92 --> 4238.32]  Oh,
[4238.56 --> 4241.06]  homogeneous system architecture,
[4241.24 --> 4241.88]  or whatever it is.
[4241.96 --> 4242.16]  HEMA,
[4242.34 --> 4243.00]  or whatever it's called.
[4243.12 --> 4243.32]  Yeah.
[4243.98 --> 4244.34]  Anyway,
[4244.42 --> 4247.30]  the point is that the CPU and the GPU
[4247.30 --> 4249.08]  can access the memory at the same time
[4249.08 --> 4249.92]  and share with each other
[4249.92 --> 4251.48]  in a way that's totally unique
[4251.48 --> 4252.30]  and hasn't been done before.
[4252.44 --> 4254.58]  Which would also help that whole situation
[4254.58 --> 4255.32]  that you were talking about.
[4255.32 --> 4255.58]  Yes.
[4256.40 --> 4256.72]  So,
[4256.84 --> 4257.06]  I mean,
[4257.12 --> 4258.18]  we could be looking at,
[4258.48 --> 4259.36]  oh,
[4259.42 --> 4259.92]  I really want to,
[4259.92 --> 4260.06]  you know,
[4260.06 --> 4261.82]  I want to talk about that camera.
[4262.34 --> 4263.66]  I got to talk about this camera.
[4263.80 --> 4264.14]  I can't,
[4264.14 --> 4265.18]  I can't find the link right now.
[4265.24 --> 4265.50]  I'm sorry,
[4265.58 --> 4265.82]  guys,
[4266.14 --> 4268.16]  but there's a camera being shown off right now
[4268.16 --> 4268.74]  that's basically,
[4268.84 --> 4269.12]  what is it,
[4269.14 --> 4270.06]  a 2.5K camera,
[4270.16 --> 4270.32]  Brandon?
[4270.46 --> 4270.60]  Yeah.
[4270.82 --> 4270.98]  Okay,
[4271.00 --> 4272.28]  so it's a 2.5K camera
[4272.28 --> 4273.86]  that has a Mac Mini built into it.
[4274.46 --> 4274.86]  So,
[4274.98 --> 4275.94]  what that means
[4275.94 --> 4277.42]  is if you were out in the field,
[4277.52 --> 4277.94]  for example,
[4278.00 --> 4278.84]  you could shoot,
[4279.96 --> 4281.12]  you could cut together,
[4281.46 --> 4282.20]  you could output,
[4282.44 --> 4283.34]  and you could upload
[4283.34 --> 4284.32]  from one machine.
[4284.52 --> 4284.74]  So,
[4284.78 --> 4285.76]  you get home from your shoot,
[4285.90 --> 4286.80]  you put that on your desk,
[4286.86 --> 4288.44]  you plug your monitor and peripherals into it,
[4288.82 --> 4289.14]  boom.
[4289.56 --> 4290.42]  Now you're editing.
[4290.84 --> 4291.16]  Now,
[4291.38 --> 4292.92]  I think that a Mac Mini
[4292.92 --> 4293.88]  is ridiculous
[4293.88 --> 4295.84]  for this kind of an application
[4295.84 --> 4297.44]  and makes absolutely no sense,
[4297.84 --> 4298.32]  but
[4298.32 --> 4300.22]  where I see the potential here
[4300.22 --> 4301.18]  is I,
[4301.18 --> 4302.70]  I actually had this argument
[4302.70 --> 4303.36]  in the car
[4303.36 --> 4304.24]  with Edsel,
[4304.42 --> 4304.94]  who is Diesel,
[4305.26 --> 4305.80]  and Brandon,
[4305.92 --> 4306.40]  who is B-roll,
[4306.48 --> 4307.82]  because apparently we're all using real names now.
[4307.82 --> 4309.28]  I have now tweeted that article
[4309.28 --> 4309.98]  so you can grab it.
[4310.06 --> 4310.32]  Awesome.
[4311.18 --> 4312.42]  I'll just retweet it here
[4312.42 --> 4313.86]  if I can.
[4314.50 --> 4314.80]  So,
[4316.00 --> 4317.86]  let's retweet that right now.
[4318.26 --> 4318.74]  There we go.
[4318.92 --> 4319.82]  Hopefully it doesn't tell me
[4319.82 --> 4320.64]  I'm not allowed to do that.
[4320.74 --> 4320.92]  Go,
[4321.02 --> 4321.14]  go,
[4321.22 --> 4321.38]  go.
[4321.66 --> 4322.02]  All right.
[4322.22 --> 4322.44]  So,
[4322.50 --> 4323.24]  I retweeted that.
[4323.68 --> 4323.70]  So,
[4323.88 --> 4325.94]  the argument I had was,
[4326.28 --> 4326.82]  because they were saying,
[4326.88 --> 4326.96]  oh,
[4326.98 --> 4327.08]  well,
[4327.14 --> 4327.80]  that's stupid.
[4327.80 --> 4329.72]  We'll always want dedicated devices for things.
[4329.82 --> 4330.00]  I went,
[4330.08 --> 4330.26]  no,
[4330.36 --> 4330.82]  hold on.
[4331.46 --> 4331.78]  Because,
[4331.92 --> 4332.02]  oh,
[4332.04 --> 4332.14]  yeah,
[4332.20 --> 4332.34]  yeah,
[4332.40 --> 4332.56]  yeah.
[4332.88 --> 4333.62]  Edsel was saying,
[4333.88 --> 4335.00]  it'll always be cheaper
[4335.00 --> 4337.56]  to have a specialized chip
[4337.56 --> 4338.72]  that just does the one thing
[4338.72 --> 4339.48]  when you build a camera.
[4339.70 --> 4340.20]  And I said,
[4340.24 --> 4340.84]  not necessarily.
[4341.16 --> 4341.98]  Think about it this way.
[4342.16 --> 4342.96]  What's cheaper?
[4343.26 --> 4344.86]  A 16 gig SD card
[4344.86 --> 4346.56]  or a 1 gig SD card?
[4348.32 --> 4348.46]  Well,
[4348.48 --> 4349.20]  they cost the same.
[4349.50 --> 4350.28]  They cost the same now
[4350.28 --> 4352.06]  because the way that miniaturization works,
[4352.16 --> 4353.32]  the way that Moore's Law works,
[4353.76 --> 4355.90]  is that you actually get to the point
[4355.90 --> 4357.96]  where the bomb cost of building this thing
[4357.96 --> 4358.98]  is identical
[4358.98 --> 4360.76]  whether you build it
[4360.76 --> 4363.30]  at a lower manufacturing process
[4363.30 --> 4364.36]  or a higher one
[4364.36 --> 4367.14]  and just squeeze more into it.
[4367.16 --> 4368.16]  It actually doesn't really matter.
[4368.26 --> 4369.34]  The bomb cost is the same.
[4369.78 --> 4370.00]  So,
[4370.10 --> 4371.10]  we could get to the point
[4371.10 --> 4372.72]  where that processor
[4372.72 --> 4374.26]  that you would have normally found in a camera,
[4374.36 --> 4375.26]  that specialized thing,
[4375.50 --> 4375.62]  well,
[4375.64 --> 4376.90]  maybe that's going to be a Tegra 9
[4376.90 --> 4378.76]  or a Tegra 10
[4378.76 --> 4380.12]  or something along those lines.
[4380.30 --> 4383.30]  And when you look at the kind of specialized hardware
[4383.30 --> 4384.86]  that someone like an NVIDIA
[4384.86 --> 4385.40]  or an AMD
[4385.40 --> 4387.18]  is putting into an APU
[4387.18 --> 4389.14]  or an SOC such as a Tegra
[4389.14 --> 4390.52]  where it's going to support
[4390.52 --> 4392.56]  various codecs
[4392.56 --> 4394.56]  and hardware encoding
[4394.56 --> 4395.24]  and decoding
[4395.24 --> 4396.14]  and all those things,
[4396.18 --> 4397.32]  we could be looking at a situation
[4397.32 --> 4397.80]  where no,
[4398.28 --> 4399.74]  rather than ever having
[4399.74 --> 4401.40]  a specialized camera device,
[4401.60 --> 4402.86]  we could actually have
[4402.86 --> 4403.86]  every camera
[4403.86 --> 4404.94]  be a full system.
[4405.32 --> 4406.90]  And then you could unlock functionality
[4406.90 --> 4407.48]  like
[4407.48 --> 4408.78]  shooting,
[4409.10 --> 4409.90]  editing within the camera,
[4409.98 --> 4410.52]  which let's face it,
[4410.54 --> 4411.84]  we can already do on smartphones anyway.
[4411.84 --> 4413.50]  So if you could edit within your camera,
[4413.60 --> 4414.34]  now all of a sudden,
[4414.62 --> 4415.38]  maybe we've got,
[4415.44 --> 4415.78]  who knows,
[4415.86 --> 4416.98]  maybe it's 6G
[4416.98 --> 4419.08]  cellular data at that point.
[4419.34 --> 4419.70]  Now,
[4419.94 --> 4420.96]  maybe you could be
[4420.96 --> 4422.28]  the ultimate vlogger
[4422.28 --> 4424.22]  and you could have a live stream
[4424.22 --> 4425.30]  all the time
[4425.30 --> 4427.26]  in full HD quality
[4427.26 --> 4428.68]  and then you could sit down
[4428.68 --> 4429.28]  and you could edit
[4429.28 --> 4430.16]  at the end of the day
[4430.16 --> 4431.16]  if you're done streaming
[4431.16 --> 4433.10]  and you could have this device
[4433.10 --> 4434.20]  that's so versatile
[4434.20 --> 4435.62]  and so connected
[4435.62 --> 4436.90]  and it could be the only one
[4436.90 --> 4437.72]  you own at that point.
[4437.78 --> 4438.28]  You might not need
[4438.28 --> 4439.68]  a desktop computer anymore at all
[4439.68 --> 4441.26]  because that might be so powerful.
[4442.12 --> 4442.40]  I mean,
[4442.58 --> 4443.92]  that is what
[4443.92 --> 4445.56]  this concept
[4445.56 --> 4446.68]  means to me
[4446.68 --> 4447.30]  in the future.
[4448.50 --> 4449.18]  And it's,
[4449.34 --> 4449.86]  obviously,
[4449.96 --> 4450.88]  a Mac Mini is ridiculous
[4450.88 --> 4451.90]  and that's not going to work
[4451.90 --> 4452.78]  because editing
[4452.78 --> 4453.88]  two and a half K footage
[4453.88 --> 4454.44]  on a Mac Mini
[4454.44 --> 4455.18]  is going to be stupid.
[4456.18 --> 4456.44]  But...
[4456.44 --> 4457.26]  At some point.
[4457.46 --> 4458.48]  At some point,
[4459.48 --> 4460.50]  the cost of,
[4460.56 --> 4460.72]  I mean,
[4460.78 --> 4461.84]  I think the bomb cost
[4461.84 --> 4463.02]  on something like a Tegra chip
[4463.02 --> 4463.98]  is under $25.
[4464.98 --> 4465.38]  So,
[4465.86 --> 4466.82]  at some point,
[4467.12 --> 4468.24]  Tegra whatever the heck
[4468.24 --> 4469.84]  is going to be so powerful
[4469.84 --> 4471.70]  and not more expensive
[4471.70 --> 4472.56]  than something else.
[4472.72 --> 4473.84]  It's just going to make sense
[4473.84 --> 4474.22]  to do it
[4474.22 --> 4475.42]  and I'm really excited about that.
[4475.56 --> 4476.44]  I find this interesting
[4476.44 --> 4477.54]  because I don't know
[4477.54 --> 4478.14]  a lot about film
[4478.14 --> 4478.72]  but one thing
[4478.72 --> 4479.28]  that's been happening
[4479.28 --> 4479.88]  a lot lately
[4479.88 --> 4481.12]  is the barrier of entry
[4481.12 --> 4482.26]  for just anyone
[4482.26 --> 4482.98]  that wants to start
[4482.98 --> 4483.66]  making videos
[4483.66 --> 4485.40]  is constantly going down.
[4485.76 --> 4485.92]  Yes.
[4485.92 --> 4486.76]  And the ability
[4486.76 --> 4487.92]  to do different things
[4487.92 --> 4488.56]  seems to constantly
[4488.56 --> 4489.40]  be going down as well.
[4489.40 --> 4489.46]  Yes.
[4489.46 --> 4490.02]  So being able to
[4490.02 --> 4491.14]  live stream something
[4491.14 --> 4492.14]  from an event
[4492.14 --> 4493.36]  being possible
[4493.36 --> 4494.64]  by random Joe Blow
[4494.64 --> 4495.16]  is going to be
[4495.16 --> 4495.90]  really ridiculous.
[4496.06 --> 4496.44]  It's going to be amazing.
[4496.56 --> 4496.68]  I mean,
[4496.72 --> 4498.38]  it's going to be
[4498.38 --> 4500.58]  like the next generation
[4500.58 --> 4503.18]  of accessibility
[4503.18 --> 4504.58]  of being able
[4504.58 --> 4505.78]  to socially broadcast
[4505.78 --> 4506.38]  your thoughts
[4506.38 --> 4506.84]  to everyone.
[4507.02 --> 4508.04]  It's absolutely amazing
[4508.04 --> 4509.94]  and I feel very strongly
[4509.94 --> 4510.52]  that it's awesome.
[4510.96 --> 4511.70]  So let's go ahead
[4511.70 --> 4512.70]  and do that Twitter blitz
[4512.70 --> 4513.66]  that I promised before
[4513.66 --> 4514.28]  and then we're going
[4514.28 --> 4514.90]  to peace out
[4514.90 --> 4516.48]  and I'll take you
[4516.48 --> 4517.22]  back to the land.
[4517.34 --> 4517.82]  We'll go as fast
[4517.82 --> 4518.64]  as we can here, bro.
[4519.12 --> 4520.12]  I feel very bad
[4520.12 --> 4521.02]  about this.
[4521.14 --> 4524.26]  Have I seen Logan yet?
[4524.34 --> 4524.58]  Yes.
[4525.10 --> 4525.72]  I have not.
[4525.98 --> 4526.92]  I ran into him twice.
[4527.76 --> 4528.36]  Slick smile.
[4530.20 --> 4531.04]  Why wouldn't Microsoft
[4531.04 --> 4531.56]  be able to run
[4531.56 --> 4532.48]  Xbox One software
[4532.48 --> 4533.34]  with Windows 7
[4533.34 --> 4533.88]  slash 8?
[4533.98 --> 4534.34]  That could mean
[4534.34 --> 4534.62]  you could just
[4534.62 --> 4535.44]  make your own PC
[4535.44 --> 4537.24]  because they don't want to.
[4537.42 --> 4538.16]  Yeah, they could.
[4538.28 --> 4538.84]  They definitely could.
[4538.94 --> 4539.36]  I want to see
[4539.36 --> 4540.78]  an Optron-sized APU.
[4541.56 --> 4542.20]  Probably will happen
[4542.20 --> 4542.70]  at some point.
[4543.04 --> 4543.12]  Really?
[4543.12 --> 4543.70]  You're still in Seattle.
[4544.24 --> 4544.74]  You think so?
[4545.50 --> 4546.54]  Yeah, at some point, maybe.
[4547.12 --> 4548.22]  Because APU's going to
[4548.22 --> 4548.90]  be everything.
[4549.42 --> 4550.02]  I think they will
[4550.02 --> 4550.46]  go that way.
[4551.14 --> 4551.90]  Are you still in Seattle?
[4553.44 --> 4553.80]  No.
[4554.10 --> 4554.40]  Yes.
[4554.52 --> 4555.28]  I teleported.
[4555.52 --> 4557.80]  Hey, I'm new to PC gaming
[4557.80 --> 4558.46]  and my friend said
[4558.46 --> 4559.48]  I couldn't play future games
[4559.48 --> 4560.16]  on Ultra or High.
[4560.22 --> 4560.70]  What do you think?
[4560.80 --> 4561.36]  Well, it depends.
[4562.46 --> 4563.20]  Post on the forum.
[4563.60 --> 4564.90]  Post on Lenus Tech Tips forum.
[4565.06 --> 4566.08]  And post your rig specs.
[4566.14 --> 4566.66]  Yeah, rig specs.
[4566.66 --> 4568.00]  What do you think of a $30
[4568.00 --> 4569.00]  MX Blue keyboard
[4569.00 --> 4570.20]  which are reasonably well built
[4570.20 --> 4570.86]  but don't have the bells
[4570.86 --> 4571.28]  and whistles?
[4572.20 --> 4572.60]  Do it.
[4573.72 --> 4574.12]  Sure.
[4574.44 --> 4575.52]  If you don't want the bells.
[4575.86 --> 4576.94]  Yeah, if you only have $30
[4576.94 --> 4578.52]  it's that versus membrane.
[4579.06 --> 4579.40]  Do it.
[4579.52 --> 4579.64]  Yeah.
[4580.46 --> 4581.04]  Someone says
[4581.04 --> 4582.20]  B-roll's dying from work.
[4582.50 --> 4583.38]  Man down, man down.
[4583.38 --> 4583.84]  B-roll.
[4584.42 --> 4585.54]  B-roll is rolling.
[4587.04 --> 4587.90]  Two at night here
[4587.90 --> 4588.62]  in the East Coast
[4588.62 --> 4589.62]  but isn't Intel
[4589.62 --> 4590.62]  also an APU?
[4590.70 --> 4590.96]  Yes.
[4592.42 --> 4593.16]  It's terminology.
[4593.40 --> 4594.04]  Yeah, terminology.
[4594.24 --> 4595.28]  AMD wants to call it APU.
[4595.28 --> 4595.80]  Intel doesn't.
[4596.24 --> 4597.70]  I have a GTX 560 Ti
[4597.70 --> 4598.92]  on PCIe 2.0.
[4598.98 --> 4600.96]  Will a newer PCIe 3
[4600.96 --> 4601.88]  work on my older motherboard?
[4601.96 --> 4602.14]  Yes.
[4603.76 --> 4604.04]  Whoops.
[4604.26 --> 4605.16]  Didn't know it was a topic.
[4605.54 --> 4605.74]  Okay.
[4605.96 --> 4606.24]  Buh.
[4607.16 --> 4607.68]  Could you explain
[4607.68 --> 4608.36]  about the shot incident
[4608.36 --> 4608.92]  in more detail?
[4609.06 --> 4609.66]  Maybe next week.
[4610.90 --> 4612.00]  We've already covered that.
[4612.32 --> 4612.86]  Really want to know
[4612.86 --> 4613.46]  what the big deal is
[4613.46 --> 4614.00]  about Windows 8
[4614.00 --> 4614.84]  not having a start menu.
[4615.36 --> 4616.02]  What are they missing?
[4616.18 --> 4616.32]  Go.
[4617.26 --> 4618.16]  It's usability.
[4618.32 --> 4619.50]  You're adding so many more steps.
[4620.00 --> 4621.18]  Why add so many more steps?
[4621.30 --> 4622.04]  More clicks is bad.
[4622.46 --> 4623.40]  My mom's Vesta computer
[4623.40 --> 4624.24]  came with Classic Start
[4624.24 --> 4625.12]  installed in it by default
[4625.12 --> 4625.70]  maybe that's something
[4625.70 --> 4626.42]  that they're doing now
[4626.42 --> 4626.92]  that I'm gone.
[4627.52 --> 4628.06]  So there you go.
[4628.52 --> 4629.14]  What's your opinion
[4629.14 --> 4630.14]  on choosing a device
[4630.14 --> 4630.64]  to stream videos?
[4630.64 --> 4631.40]  It's probably the Russian
[4631.40 --> 4632.12]  who came up with it.
[4632.46 --> 4633.02]  What's your opinion
[4633.02 --> 4633.84]  for choosing a device
[4633.84 --> 4634.44]  to stream videos
[4634.44 --> 4635.06]  from my NAS
[4635.06 --> 4635.70]  and surf the net?
[4635.96 --> 4637.56]  HTPC or Android Mini PC?
[4638.76 --> 4640.44]  I go HTPC
[4640.44 --> 4641.78]  but I don't pay a lot
[4641.78 --> 4642.88]  for computer components
[4642.88 --> 4645.44]  so I prefer the functionality
[4645.44 --> 4646.26]  of an HTPC
[4646.26 --> 4648.14]  but it's much more expensive.
[4648.14 --> 4648.86]  A lot of people
[4648.86 --> 4649.50]  can get
[4649.50 --> 4652.80]  old computers.
[4653.24 --> 4653.62]  That's true.
[4653.64 --> 4654.44]  It's not that hard
[4654.44 --> 4655.52]  to get an old computer.
[4655.64 --> 4656.08]  And you don't need
[4656.08 --> 4656.84]  a powerful computer
[4656.84 --> 4657.66]  to be an HTPC
[4657.66 --> 4658.46]  at all.
[4658.66 --> 4658.84]  No.
[4659.26 --> 4660.34]  So I would look into
[4660.34 --> 4661.48]  trying to inherit one
[4661.48 --> 4661.98]  from a relative
[4661.98 --> 4664.10]  or even just going somewhere
[4664.10 --> 4664.64]  where they kind of
[4664.64 --> 4665.28]  throw away computers.
[4665.36 --> 4665.92]  I think we talked
[4665.92 --> 4666.90]  a fair bit about AMD
[4666.90 --> 4668.16]  abandoning FX
[4668.16 --> 4669.10]  and sort of the rumors
[4669.10 --> 4669.98]  circulating around that.
[4670.04 --> 4670.46]  Do you think that
[4670.46 --> 4671.44]  this century is having
[4671.44 --> 4672.72]  the most technological advances
[4672.72 --> 4673.78]  and probably the biggest
[4673.78 --> 4674.86]  for a good while?
[4675.68 --> 4675.88]  Yeah.
[4676.20 --> 4678.42]  It always...
[4678.42 --> 4678.66]  Yeah.
[4678.98 --> 4679.94]  Is there enough benefit
[4679.94 --> 4680.88]  in going MATX
[4680.88 --> 4682.28]  over MITX price-wise?
[4682.84 --> 4683.26]  No.
[4684.30 --> 4685.34]  The benefit is
[4685.34 --> 4686.20]  more expansion slots.
[4686.36 --> 4686.46]  Yeah.
[4686.96 --> 4687.54]  Thoughts on
[4687.54 --> 4688.80]  Video Game High School
[4688.80 --> 4689.42]  Season 2
[4689.42 --> 4690.08]  if you watched them?
[4690.10 --> 4690.74]  Have you watched any yet?
[4690.86 --> 4691.92]  It's been good so far.
[4692.06 --> 4692.50]  I've liked it.
[4692.64 --> 4693.76]  I like that they spread out.
[4693.98 --> 4695.02]  Before they only did
[4695.02 --> 4695.44]  one game.
[4696.00 --> 4697.36]  Basically only did one game.
[4697.42 --> 4698.34]  And now it's still
[4698.34 --> 4699.66]  focused on the one game
[4699.66 --> 4700.80]  but they're spreading out
[4700.80 --> 4701.54]  more which is nice.
[4702.14 --> 4702.44]  Alright.
[4702.44 --> 4705.24]  So without further ado
[4705.24 --> 4706.26]  and my wireless link
[4706.26 --> 4707.62]  to this freaking thing
[4707.62 --> 4709.74]  is causing me grief.
[4710.02 --> 4711.36]  I'm actually going to
[4711.36 --> 4712.48]  I'm going to ask you guys
[4712.48 --> 4713.46]  to bear with me
[4713.46 --> 4715.40]  while I load up
[4715.40 --> 4716.38]  our outro manually.
[4717.72 --> 4718.76]  Thank you so much
[4718.76 --> 4720.02]  for watching tonight you guys.
[4720.12 --> 4721.60]  You're awesome as usual.
[4722.32 --> 4724.86]  And we will see you again
[4724.86 --> 4726.74]  next week.
[4727.02 --> 4728.30]  And I really hope
[4728.30 --> 4729.44]  that I can find the file
[4729.44 --> 4730.44]  that I'm looking for here
[4730.44 --> 4731.18]  because that
[4731.18 --> 4732.86]  that is a challenge.
[4733.32 --> 4734.42]  That is a challenge.
[4735.10 --> 4736.30]  And boom!
[4736.30 --> 4764.04]  Don't forget guys, 20% off elite prices with the offer code Linus.
[4764.04 --> 4768.86]  Sign up at that bit.ly link, bit.ly slash hs share.
[4769.94 --> 4770.62]  Good night.
[4771.34 --> 4772.14]  Good night.
[4772.80 --> 4775.04]  Good night.
[4779.04 --> 4780.30]  No one's going to get it.
[4780.30 --> 4784.06]  Good night.
[4787.54 --> 4793.18]  Good night.
