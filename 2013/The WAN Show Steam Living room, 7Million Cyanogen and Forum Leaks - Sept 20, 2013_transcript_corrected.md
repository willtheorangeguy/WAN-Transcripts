[0.00 → 7.00] Alright, we should be live now. As many people in the Twitch chat have noticed, Linus is not here.
[7.00 → 12.00] As some of you might notice in the next few seconds, we are early.
[12.00 → 18.00] I'm super stoked because we're early. It is 4.28. Our start time is 4.30.
[18.00 → 23.00] So I'm not really going to get into any super awesome topics right away.
[23.00 → 26.00] I just wanted to make sure that I was exactly two minutes early.
[26.00 → 32.00] Because we're usually exactly anywhere between 0 and 15,000 minutes late.
[32.00 → 36.00] So I just really actually wanted to be early this time.
[36.00 → 41.00] Linus is in Hawaii for undisclosed reasons that many of you have already figured out.
[41.00 → 45.00] But I'm not going to say anything because I'm not sure if I'm allowed.
[45.00 → 49.00] This here is my brother, Colds on the Tweet.
[49.00 → 54.00] He is a Star Craft caster aficionado.
[54.00 → 56.00] Aficionado? Sure.
[56.00 → 58.00] Amateur Star Craft caster.
[58.00 → 62.00] And you can look him up on Twitter, like I said, at Colds.
[62.00 → 67.00] For this stream, the Twitter blitzes will be controlled by my Twitter.
[67.00 → 73.00] So if you want to Tweet in for any Twitter blitz that I call out, I would Tweet at Slick PC for now.
[73.00 → 77.00] I'm sure next week when Linus is back, we'll go back to Linus's Twitter.
[77.00 → 81.00] But right now it's just a lot easier for me to manage if it's my Twitter.
[81.00 → 85.00] There will also be an after party.
[85.00 → 88.00] People have been looking for an after party for a while.
[88.00 → 91.00] The after party will be myself and my brother.
[91.00 → 96.00] It's going to take us a little bit because we're going to race over to my house before we actually do the after party.
[96.00 → 100.00] So there will be a little bit of a time gap, but we're going to leave immediately after the stream
[100.00 → 103.00] and start immediately when we get to my house and everything is already set up.
[103.00 → 104.00] So it should be pretty quick.
[104.00 → 107.00] I'm guessing about 10–15 minutes.
[107.00 → 109.00] So there will be an after party.
[109.00 → 111.00] That's the Twitter you should be using.
[111.00 → 112.00] Blah blah blah blah blah.
[112.00 → 114.00] Now we're going to roll right into it.
[114.00 → 117.00] So for the topic call-outs I have for this week,
[117.00 → 121.00] Valve has some teasers for Living Room Something in 2014.
[121.00 → 123.00] They're not releasing a lot of other information about it.
[123.00 → 129.00] And Nintendo legend Hiroshi Yamauchi has passed away, which is super depressing.
[129.00 → 132.00] But I'm going to pass it on to some less depressing news.
[132.00 → 135.00] Cyanogen Mod raises $7 million.
[135.00 → 138.00] They're going to be doing some fascinating things.
[138.00 → 139.00] We'll delve into that.
[139.00 → 140.00] And Data 2 land support.
[140.00 → 141.00] Land support.
[141.00 → 142.00] Data 2.
[142.00 → 143.00] Land support is awesome.
[143.00 → 145.00] Something we've been missing in gaming.
[145.00 → 147.00] You know, glad someone's finally changing and saying,
[147.00 → 148.00] no, you can still do that.
[148.00 → 151.00] You know, big companies have tried to set a precedent that you can't do that.
[151.00 → 153.00] And it's not true, as we're seeing.
[153.00 → 154.00] So Data 2 will be offering land support.
[154.00 → 156.00] We'll talk about that as well.
[156.00 → 159.00] We went from like negative EA news every week
[159.00 → 162.00] and now we're transitioning into like positive Valve news every week.
[162.00 → 165.00] Because last week they had the family and friends sharing.
[165.00 → 168.00] And then this week they have like, there's something coming.
[168.00 → 171.00] And whenever there's a something coming from Valve, it's always epic.
[171.00 → 173.00] So we're going to roll into the intro, which will work this week.
[173.00 → 174.00] And we're back.
[174.00 → 179.00] I know that had Linus in the intro, but we didn't forget to subscribe to our channel.
[179.00 → 183.00] And we're back.
[183.00 → 184.00] We're back.
[184.00 → 185.00] We're back.
[185.00 → 186.00] We're back.
[186.00 → 188.00] We're back.
[188.00 → 195.00] And we're back.
[195.00 → 196.00] And we're back.
[196.00 → 201.00] And I know that had Linus in the intro, but we didn't feel like recreating all the assets
[201.00 → 202.00] for this show, apparently.
[202.00 → 203.00] So that's what we have.
[203.00 → 207.00] The first topic that I want to jump into is Netflix CEO.
[207.00 → 208.24] So that's what we have.
[208.32 → 212.26] The first topic that I want to jump into is Netflix CEO.
[212.26 → 215.86] If I can get you to bring this up on your screen, we'll switch to your screen.
[216.34 → 222.44] So Netflix, not CEO, sorry, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Saran dos has said that
[222.44 → 226.52] bandwidth caps in Canada are basically a human rights violation.
[226.84 → 232.10] So as you can see on this website here, it is almost a human rights violation what they're
[232.10 → 234.12] charging for internet access in Canada.
[234.12 → 239.44] And what he's referring to is low broadband caps in place at Canadian ISPs that started
[239.44 → 240.90] around 15 gigabytes.
[241.52 → 248.50] Now, the first thing I noticed when reading this article was like, yeah, okay, that's
[248.50 → 248.82] horrible.
[249.38 → 251.20] I've dealt with bandwidth caps in Canada before.
[251.32 → 252.76] I've dealt with slow internet in Canada before.
[253.10 → 257.00] I've dealt with crappy, terrible pricing for internet in Canada before.
[257.92 → 261.96] But what almost needs to get more attention is like, yeah, Canada is a bad situation right
[261.96 → 262.18] now.
[262.38 → 263.76] But look at Australia.
[264.12 → 268.14] I have a bunch of mods that I talk to constantly and a bunch of foreign members that I talk
[268.14 → 272.48] to quite consistently from Strata, as they say.
[272.70 → 275.22] It's apostrophe capital S, Tray.
[275.36 → 276.22] It's freaking awesome.
[276.32 → 276.74] I love it.
[277.08 → 279.92] But their internet is so much worse right now.
[280.02 → 280.32] It is.
[280.38 → 285.28] And there are even some places in like the UK where I've talked to people, and they have
[285.28 → 286.52] even worse situations than us.
[286.52 → 291.46] So while I'm happy that the Netflix chief content officer is pointing out that it's kind of
[291.46 → 295.48] crap in Canada, it's kind of crap in a lot of places.
[295.98 → 298.54] Do you have any idea what Netflix's presence is in Australia?
[299.20 → 299.38] No.
[299.38 → 302.38] Are they a service there?
[302.84 → 306.00] Do they have to fake American IP addresses like some Canadians do?
[306.26 → 306.54] That's interesting.
[306.64 → 307.06] Well, okay.
[307.20 → 309.94] Because it's a service here, but it's fantastic.
[310.26 → 310.48] It is.
[310.48 → 313.92] So are you wondering like how possibly fantastic it is?
[314.00 → 315.88] Or if it even exists in Australia.
[315.88 → 320.90] Because I know because of copyright laws and different things that we have in Canada to
[320.90 → 322.32] protect Canadian artists.
[322.42 → 323.18] Same thing with the radio.
[323.72 → 325.96] You have to have so much content and Ada, Ada, Ada.
[326.14 → 326.64] There we go.
[326.70 → 327.66] Watching the Twitch chat.
[327.92 → 329.60] Apparently they do have it, but it's crap.
[329.72 → 330.94] That's really similar to Canada.
[331.12 → 334.74] Like we don't have a lot of content, and it's not very high quality.
[334.86 → 338.54] Like a lot of times the only streams you can properly get are low quality streams because
[338.54 → 343.16] Netflix is automatically adapting to try and figure out how good your picture can be.
[343.16 → 349.74] So a lot of the really commonly Canadians will VPN or some other form VPN down to the States
[349.74 → 354.56] and then watch their Netflix through a VPN so they can get access to all this increased
[354.56 → 355.40] amount of content.
[355.50 → 357.02] Someone just said we don't have it.
[357.30 → 359.36] I have other people saying they do have it.
[361.44 → 367.06] Not entirely sure, but anyway, it's, it's, it's just kind of bad everywhere.
[367.24 → 372.12] And this is interesting because for the longest time, everyone has praised the internet for
[372.12 → 373.42] being this crazy, crazy thing.
[373.56 → 378.10] But now that it's been around for a long time, ISPs got really complacent sitting on
[378.10 → 381.14] all that praise and have done nothing.
[381.50 → 381.80] Really.
[382.06 → 382.30] Literally.
[382.34 → 384.26] A lot of ISPs are still just laying copper.
[385.32 → 386.52] Just like, do-do-do-do-do.
[386.64 → 387.48] We don't need fibre.
[387.60 → 388.16] No one cares.
[388.30 → 388.92] Do-do-do-do-do.
[388.98 → 391.20] And now everyone's like, hey, listen.
[391.92 → 393.34] Everything is going to the internet though.
[393.40 → 394.02] That's another thing.
[394.36 → 395.76] You know, we're talking, we're talking about Netflix.
[395.88 → 397.00] It's now what you watch on TV.
[397.18 → 397.34] Yeah.
[397.40 → 398.32] It's how you use your phone.
[398.40 → 400.78] It's how you use, you know, your tablet if you choose to have one.
[401.06 → 402.84] We have a laptop on each of our laps.
[402.96 → 408.14] You know, internet is going to be the medium for everything from VoIP to just general surfing
[408.14 → 409.86] to everything we do nowadays.
[410.02 → 411.70] So that bandwidth has to increase.
[411.84 → 415.28] And people are even thinking about like NVIDIA is setting up those things so you can stream
[415.28 → 416.20] games down.
[416.80 → 417.60] Like that's insane.
[417.68 → 418.50] That's going to take so much bandwidth.
[418.86 → 421.44] Every new technology that comes out seems to be internet connected.
[421.56 → 422.36] So that's a perfect point.
[422.36 → 426.70] Even in this room, we each have a phone, we each have a laptop, and there's a stream
[426.70 → 426.98] PC.
[427.44 → 427.56] Yep.
[428.46 → 430.14] Like holy crap.
[430.38 → 430.72] Everything is there.
[430.72 → 432.26] There's another laptop over there.
[432.76 → 434.92] Like there's just so much stuff.
[435.10 → 435.52] And in every room in this house.
[435.52 → 436.94] We're not including anything past the door.
[437.00 → 437.24] No.
[437.52 → 438.92] And this is a tiny room.
[439.04 → 440.58] Like we barely even fit in this room.
[440.94 → 445.24] Like you guys have seen sometimes if I have to leave the scene, I like to climb over the back
[445.24 → 448.86] of the couch and like ninja jump across so that I can actually get out of the room.
[449.04 → 450.30] Which is kind of absurd.
[450.82 → 452.06] So we just wanted to bring that up.
[452.06 → 455.80] Netflix does recognize that things suck, and they are pointing it out.
[456.44 → 457.68] I do appreciate that.
[457.88 → 458.56] Good for them though.
[458.62 → 461.06] Who else in a power position has done something like that?
[461.26 → 461.42] Yeah.
[461.48 → 462.36] Because it is ridiculous.
[462.52 → 463.38] It is terrible.
[463.68 → 465.90] And as you know, to repeat what you said, it's bad in Canada.
[466.00 → 466.76] It's bad in other places.
[466.94 → 470.82] But at least it's getting a spotlight somewhere by someone who's in a power position.
[470.92 → 471.26] For sure.
[471.38 → 476.54] And it's surprising that he's willing to call out an entire country's worth of companies.
[477.26 → 479.20] It's like you all suck.
[479.34 → 479.62] Yes.
[479.62 → 481.50] It's interesting.
[482.06 → 489.34] Now we're going to jump down to Cyanogen, which has raised $7 million from capital investment
[489.34 → 493.08] recently from Benchmark Capital and Repoint Ventures.
[493.32 → 494.20] They've raised $7 million.
[496.58 → 501.64] Cyanogen is an interesting little beast because there's a huge amount of registered users that
[501.64 → 502.02] are on it.
[502.02 → 503.28] I don't remember the exact number.
[503.44 → 503.68] Do you remember?
[503.78 → 504.74] It's like 8 million.
[505.78 → 506.38] It's something crazy.
[506.50 → 509.06] I think it's 8 million registered users.
[509.06 → 513.96] And that's only the people that are clicking the button saying that they...
[513.96 → 514.82] To share the information.
[514.92 → 515.06] Yeah.
[515.16 → 515.68] To share the information.
[515.68 → 516.60] Which I never click in my life.
[516.66 → 517.04] Exactly.
[517.20 → 519.68] Because that might take a kilobyte of bandwidth that I want.
[519.78 → 521.80] Because I have some of the world's worst internet.
[521.80 → 521.88] Yeah.
[522.30 → 525.16] So I need to keep that completely on lockdown.
[525.92 → 526.14] Yeah.
[526.30 → 526.56] So.
[526.76 → 527.00] Sorry.
[527.42 → 528.96] I'm just one of the people who would not...
[528.96 → 529.36] That's a pretty good time.
[529.36 → 531.24] I'm just one of those people who would not click...
[531.24 → 531.74] Or sorry.
[531.84 → 532.82] Would unique that button.
[532.90 → 533.60] I'm one of those guys.
[533.66 → 534.00] I would too.
[534.04 → 534.80] It's not even clicking.
[534.90 → 536.18] You have to go and select it.
[536.36 → 538.00] Which is a large part of the reason why it's not that many.
[538.22 → 539.94] I would never go find it for one.
[540.14 → 542.36] And for two, I would never select it just because...
[542.36 → 544.24] I'm always really scared.
[544.68 → 546.42] But what other information might be sharing, right?
[546.68 → 546.74] That's true.
[546.74 → 548.40] So personally, I care about that.
[548.74 → 553.44] The only program that I do like share my usage data is Firefox.
[553.92 → 557.48] And that's because I've been running their pre-alpha program for a long time.
[557.50 → 559.82] Well, now that you've said that, just to not jump ahead of you a little bit.
[560.18 → 560.62] But...
[560.62 → 562.50] And we'll talk about my story of this morning.
[562.70 → 562.80] Yeah.
[562.80 → 563.40] A little bit later.
[563.48 → 566.10] But I was on CyogenMod today, and it reminded me of Firefox.
[566.36 → 567.76] Because I know you like to run Nightly.
[567.94 → 568.12] Yeah.
[568.30 → 570.84] And there's Aurora and there are a couple other versions.
[571.00 → 571.84] I actually just...
[571.84 → 572.52] I'm boring.
[572.62 → 573.36] I just run the stock.
[573.84 → 575.44] But CyogenMod does the same thing.
[575.50 → 577.48] They have completely unstable versions.
[577.74 → 578.60] And they rate them.
[578.64 → 579.92] There are four actual ratings.
[580.44 → 581.80] And so you can jump into different versions.
[581.92 → 583.42] Which completely reminded me of Firefox.
[583.64 → 585.12] Which we're both a big fan of.
[585.12 → 585.68] Four ratings.
[585.96 → 588.62] The normal one, Beta, Aurora, and Nightly.
[588.70 → 588.96] You're right.
[589.38 → 590.46] That's fascinating.
[591.52 → 593.70] So actually, to get into your story.
[594.02 → 598.04] One of the big reasons why people are thinking CyogenMod doesn't have more users.
[598.18 → 599.26] Like way more users.
[599.26 → 602.08] Is their extremely complicated installation process.
[602.18 → 603.80] Which can be around 23 steps.
[604.42 → 609.04] Now, when I brought the idea of this topic up to Richard.
[609.22 → 612.00] My brother at Colds on Twitter for the new viewers.
[613.00 → 614.56] He was like, oh, that's cool.
[614.66 → 615.82] I should install it on my phone.
[616.82 → 618.60] And I was like, yes, that's awesome.
[618.72 → 620.78] So he goes to install it on his phone this morning.
[621.74 → 622.14] And...
[622.14 → 624.60] Well, I spent two hours trying to figure out.
[624.70 → 626.00] Maybe not quite two hours.
[626.06 → 627.56] There was some YouTube in there and things like that.
[627.62 → 631.28] But I spent a decent amount of time this morning trying to get it to work.
[631.66 → 633.84] And I had a cable that you actually brought me.
[633.96 → 634.14] Yeah.
[635.14 → 636.88] An extremely long ribbon cable.
[637.02 → 637.80] Which is pretty cool.
[637.98 → 638.18] Yeah.
[638.40 → 639.32] Ribbon USB cable.
[639.46 → 640.82] Like super long.
[640.82 → 643.22] From Korea that I brought back.
[643.28 → 644.02] So I thought it would be cool.
[644.56 → 646.00] Was having some connection issues.
[646.00 → 648.12] Between the phone and the PC.
[648.50 → 650.40] And realized eventually that, you know, it could be my cable.
[650.46 → 651.30] So I swapped out the cable.
[651.36 → 651.88] Oh, it's working.
[652.26 → 652.84] That's great.
[652.92 → 653.04] Right?
[653.08 → 653.76] So I went into it.
[654.06 → 655.64] I was using a program called Odin.
[655.76 → 657.76] Which it seems like all the YouTuber guys have been using.
[658.62 → 659.90] I went to...
[659.90 → 660.90] First you have to root your phone.
[661.06 → 663.10] Before you can even do any sort of mod.
[663.36 → 664.06] So I went to root it.
[664.10 → 664.86] Program crashes.
[665.16 → 667.02] You know, Windows says, would you like to send this error?
[667.40 → 668.56] Would you like to close the program?
[668.62 → 669.46] So I said, close it.
[669.76 → 671.06] Now I'm locked into a boot loop.
[671.68 → 672.60] Which terrified me.
[672.64 → 674.70] Because for my work, I have to use my phone constantly.
[676.18 → 677.10] So a little bit scared.
[677.20 → 680.52] Finally figured out how I could unbolt loop it through the Odin mod.
[680.58 → 681.26] So I did that.
[681.70 → 682.64] That was successful.
[683.60 → 685.72] But then again, when I tried to root it.
[685.80 → 687.04] Again, the whole program crashes.
[687.04 → 688.78] I spent a little bit of time on Google.
[689.04 → 690.58] Like I was running out of time by this point.
[690.64 → 691.20] I had to head over here.
[691.68 → 692.86] But I spent a little bit of time on Google.
[692.92 → 694.74] It seems to be a problem for a lot of people.
[695.12 → 698.30] That while you're halfway through the whole program.
[698.52 → 699.30] It's not an error.
[699.44 → 700.16] Like, oh, this didn't work.
[700.56 → 704.18] It's a Windows, the whole program flat line.
[704.52 → 705.02] That's crazy.
[705.26 → 710.64] And like that would even add more to that statistic of users that haven't pressed the button and have pressed the button.
[710.74 → 714.36] So there's an insane amount of people that want to use Cyanogen.
[714.36 → 715.60] That are using Cyanogen.
[715.74 → 716.72] That are using Cyanogen.
[716.86 → 718.66] But aren't enabling their sharing thing.
[718.90 → 721.12] They have a huge, huge power behind them.
[721.22 → 727.32] So they want to become the third-biggest phone OS out there.
[727.38 → 728.54] So they want to be behind iOS.
[728.68 → 729.78] They want to be behind Android.
[730.06 → 731.48] And they want to have their own little thing.
[731.56 → 734.76] Now this isn't saying that they're creating their own operating system from scratch.
[734.76 → 738.00] They're building on top of the base Android layer.
[738.28 → 743.24] But what they want to do is create the usability experience that they would want to have personally.
[743.48 → 748.02] So Steve Kodak is the big guy behind Cyanogen.
[748.16 → 750.46] And he wants to create an experience that he would want.
[751.30 → 753.56] He's quoted saying some pretty awesome stuff.
[754.10 → 759.10] So there's a lot you can do whenever you listen to the users on what they want.
[759.10 → 760.74] That's one of his biggest quotes.
[760.86 → 762.20] Which is like, boom.
[762.52 → 766.62] Microsoft is pouring billions of dollars into everything.
[766.72 → 767.88] Because they have billions of dollars worth of revenue.
[768.00 → 769.04] But they're pouring tons of money.
[769.20 → 770.18] I don't know exactly how much.
[770.24 → 771.14] Into Windows Phone.
[771.40 → 772.90] And Windows Phone is not catching on.
[773.44 → 774.98] Cyanogen is catching on.
[776.52 → 778.08] Interesting little disconnect there.
[778.34 → 782.04] It's probably because Cyanogen is actually paying a ton of attention to their users.
[782.14 → 783.46] And doing exactly what their users want.
[783.46 → 786.88] It's just, it's so interesting.
[787.00 → 788.30] They already have a hardware partner.
[788.68 → 791.88] And that hardware partner has been like 99.9% leaked.
[792.32 → 794.92] If you, it's pretty easy to read into it.
[794.98 → 797.64] He says he's going to be at the Opp event.
[798.84 → 800.74] Which, like, probably.
[800.74 → 801.30] Is that their event?
[801.30 → 802.80] Yeah, like it's probably going to happen.
[802.80 → 803.64] Just for high-fives.
[803.82 → 803.92] No.
[803.98 → 804.16] Yeah.
[804.54 → 805.62] Hey guys, what's up?
[805.96 → 807.68] We're a possible hardware partnership.
[807.68 → 810.40] And you like posted this video on your website and stuff.
[810.54 → 811.08] High five.
[811.08 → 814.60] So it's probably going to be them.
[815.04 → 815.80] It's pretty awesome.
[815.88 → 817.90] Now you might be wondering, how do they expect to make money?
[817.98 → 821.26] Because if there's an investment of $7 million, they have to make money somehow.
[821.68 → 832.08] Now he has said, he has said, the mobile devices out there, they're not just, they're just not meant for anybody to use.
[832.14 → 833.02] That's a direct quote from him.
[833.02 → 836.72] And then he carries on from that to say, they're essentially mobile cash registers.
[837.08 → 840.58] We want to help you get stuff done and use these things to their fullest potential.
[841.08 → 841.40] So.
[841.90 → 842.74] How cool does that sound?
[842.82 → 843.58] That sounds awesome.
[843.68 → 845.20] All of his quotes are so legit.
[845.60 → 849.42] And then he goes on to say, no comment has been made on how we will make money.
[849.88 → 856.02] If, but if you're a default, if you're a default OS on a device, and you have 50 million users, there are a lot of ways to make money.
[856.24 → 859.36] Now, the only thing I want to throw in there, I, I can't say I disagree with that.
[859.60 → 860.60] Makes a lot of sense.
[860.60 → 862.52] But what about Reddit?
[863.82 → 864.84] Reddit loses money.
[864.98 → 865.96] That's what we were talking about.
[866.06 → 866.82] That's a good point.
[866.92 → 869.34] So Reddit, Reddit bleeds money all the time.
[869.42 → 871.24] But as a phone OS, like.
[871.82 → 872.18] True.
[872.30 → 873.62] I, I, I totally understand.
[873.80 → 874.38] You can't.
[874.50 → 875.58] It's not an orange and an orange.
[875.74 → 875.84] It's.
[875.84 → 875.96] Yeah.
[876.16 → 877.22] But it's just.
[877.62 → 877.86] You have a good point though.
[877.86 → 879.02] They do need to figure out a path.
[879.08 → 879.28] Yep.
[879.32 → 879.60] They do.
[879.84 → 880.20] Because.
[881.32 → 882.90] Reddit is a decent example.
[883.04 → 883.38] Probably not.
[883.46 → 884.70] I'm probably going to get flamed in the comments.
[884.70 → 890.12] But it's a decent example of a situation where they are heavily used.
[890.24 → 891.82] Like they call themselves the front page of the internet.
[892.04 → 892.68] They basically are.
[892.76 → 893.22] They are.
[893.46 → 893.62] Yeah.
[893.76 → 894.08] You know.
[894.68 → 895.78] But they're losing money.
[896.14 → 896.24] Right?
[896.30 → 896.60] It's just.
[896.70 → 897.02] It's just.
[898.14 → 901.90] But Reddit is a very difficult platform to monetize.
[902.08 → 908.70] That once they do, once they hopefully do, they will make giant mountains of planet sized
[908.70 → 909.76] piles of cash.
[910.12 → 910.22] Yeah.
[910.22 → 911.98] Because they have the biggest user base ever.
[912.84 → 912.86] But.
[912.96 → 913.34] It's true.
[913.34 → 915.42] With an OS, like your store.
[916.16 → 917.60] You can have promoted items in your store.
[918.08 → 918.56] Which you can.
[918.78 → 921.30] If you have 50 million users, you can rake in money with that.
[921.46 → 921.74] Absolutely.
[921.92 → 923.12] You can take a cut out of your store.
[923.56 → 924.12] You can do.
[924.22 → 924.40] Like.
[924.62 → 925.98] You can do other things.
[926.14 → 926.54] I hear you.
[926.56 → 931.08] Instead of like destroying your user audience by forcing ads on their face all the time.
[931.16 → 932.24] Like you don't have to do that.
[932.30 → 933.34] You can do things that are a lot.
[934.00 → 935.14] A lot less aggressive.
[935.80 → 935.90] Right.
[935.90 → 937.72] And you don't have to like to hurt your viewer audience.
[938.34 → 940.20] Two things that I want to call it right away.
[940.20 → 942.98] I can tweet these out right now.
[943.34 → 944.52] Just so you guys can get them.
[944.68 → 946.62] Because I don't necessarily want to put them on stream.
[946.74 → 948.66] One of them is a video that was released by them.
[949.04 → 950.58] And the audio on it is just horrible.
[950.72 → 952.52] So I don't want to make all of your ears bleed.
[953.72 → 955.16] But I'm going to tweet out two things.
[955.22 → 956.02] So you can watch it yourself.
[956.10 → 957.70] But like I said, be careful with that video.
[957.80 → 958.92] Because it is a little bit crazy.
[958.92 → 960.04] In the audio there.
[960.18 → 961.64] When he's talking it's fine.
[961.96 → 963.40] And then it cuts away from him talking.
[963.50 → 964.26] It gets a little bit nuts.
[964.52 → 968.28] There's also a Reddit AMA about everything that's going on.
[968.34 → 971.42] And that AMA has stuff in it that's unreleased anywhere else.
[971.56 → 974.12] So I would actually highly recommend reading through that AMA.
[974.20 → 976.46] Just find the original poster's name in blue.
[976.80 → 977.98] And then control F for it.
[978.02 → 979.32] And just bounce all of his answers.
[979.44 → 981.12] That's a really easy way to go through AMA's.
[981.48 → 982.90] If you haven't done that before.
[983.90 → 985.72] One of the biggest things they're working on.
[985.84 → 987.56] Which would help solve your problem, hopefully.
[988.38 → 993.36] Is one of the biggest and foremost things that they're working on.
[993.66 → 995.60] Is a one click installer.
[996.52 → 998.62] So that's just kind of awesome.
[998.98 → 1000.62] Because they have some screenshots up for it.
[1000.80 → 1002.94] And it's a really difficult process like you were talking about.
[1003.14 → 1004.40] Everyone says it is.
[1004.46 → 1005.86] And there's just so many parts work and fail.
[1005.96 → 1007.24] It takes so many different things to work.
[1007.60 → 1008.52] There are so many different devices.
[1008.66 → 1009.88] And even finding the firmwares.
[1010.24 → 1010.66] Things like that.
[1010.80 → 1011.46] It was.
[1011.46 → 1014.24] And I started with an iPhone.
[1014.76 → 1017.34] I considered my iPhone useless without it being jailbroken.
[1017.50 → 1018.32] Like I've been.
[1018.50 → 1019.58] And I know jailbreak and rooting.
[1019.76 → 1020.22] It is different.
[1020.32 → 1020.84] Of course it is.
[1020.88 → 1021.50] We understand that.
[1021.68 → 1023.00] But you've been down that general road.
[1023.18 → 1023.50] Exactly.
[1023.72 → 1024.34] The general road.
[1024.46 → 1024.64] You know.
[1024.74 → 1026.12] It wasn't my first kick at it.
[1026.26 → 1026.52] You know.
[1026.66 → 1029.08] And I did have a limited time frame.
[1029.24 → 1030.08] Limited time frame.
[1030.12 → 1030.78] But it was difficult.
[1030.96 → 1032.00] It wasn't a fun experience.
[1032.58 → 1034.88] And having a one click installer.
[1034.98 → 1035.88] A wizard installer.
[1036.44 → 1037.82] Would be so much easier.
[1037.82 → 1038.10] Yeah.
[1038.22 → 1038.52] And like.
[1038.88 → 1039.98] If I tried to get.
[1039.98 → 1041.64] Cyanogen wants to be mainstream now.
[1041.82 → 1043.46] So if we handed a phone right now.
[1043.60 → 1044.06] To mom.
[1045.16 → 1045.50] And was like.
[1045.50 → 1045.90] Hey mom.
[1045.96 → 1046.64] It's dull Cyanogen.
[1047.32 → 1047.64] No.
[1048.40 → 1051.60] If that phone still works in 20 minutes.
[1051.78 → 1053.00] Or has been touched.
[1053.06 → 1053.58] One of the two.
[1053.82 → 1054.08] Yes.
[1054.14 → 1055.32] It either wouldn't have been touched.
[1055.40 → 1056.34] Or totally won't work.
[1056.46 → 1058.22] I'm going to go with the wouldn't have been touched part.
[1058.22 → 1059.54] But like.
[1059.70 → 1060.52] It's not going to happen.
[1060.80 → 1062.40] My mom is fairly technical.
[1062.40 → 1063.82] For the average mom.
[1063.94 → 1064.16] Sorry.
[1064.28 → 1065.30] I'm not trying to stereotype.
[1065.52 → 1065.92] But it's true.
[1066.00 → 1066.62] She's quite technical.
[1066.74 → 1067.42] She plays Star craft.
[1067.52 → 1068.04] Which is awesome.
[1069.04 → 1070.04] Sent me a text last night.
[1070.60 → 1071.62] How do I build an orbital?
[1071.80 → 1072.84] How do I build an orbital?
[1072.84 → 1073.44] Command.
[1073.98 → 1074.42] SMUR.
[1075.60 → 1076.30] That's awesome.
[1076.46 → 1076.96] But like.
[1077.74 → 1079.02] It just wouldn't happen.
[1079.12 → 1080.10] It's quite an advanced process.
[1080.26 → 1082.34] But if that one click installer comes out.
[1082.34 → 1084.18] And we're able to hand a phone to mom.
[1084.46 → 1085.62] And say install Cyanogen.
[1085.78 → 1086.64] She Googles them.
[1086.82 → 1087.94] Gets their one click installer.
[1088.12 → 1088.88] Clicks the button.
[1089.02 → 1089.68] And it's done.
[1090.24 → 1090.92] There you go.
[1091.24 → 1093.64] There's a bunch more users right there.
[1093.84 → 1095.74] So that user count will explode.
[1096.16 → 1097.80] And I think if they have a one click installer.
[1097.80 → 1099.48] That actually works on everything.
[1099.96 → 1101.38] And they will release this out.
[1101.38 → 1103.08] And they start actually tracking.
[1103.58 → 1104.44] The amount of people that have.
[1104.74 → 1106.22] They have on their OS properly.
[1106.38 → 1108.48] Instead of just having the share information button.
[1108.76 → 1108.84] Yeah.
[1108.96 → 1111.76] Their user account will blow up.
[1111.76 → 1112.92] Like this is huge.
[1113.04 → 1114.50] 2014 is going to be.
[1114.86 → 1116.66] Such a crazy year for phones.
[1116.94 → 1118.28] But not in my opinion.
[1118.40 → 1119.54] Necessarily because of hardware.
[1120.70 → 1121.28] That's true.
[1121.38 → 1122.26] Well the trend is shifting.
[1122.48 → 1123.30] Every iPhone that comes out.
[1123.36 → 1124.12] They're selling less of it.
[1124.32 → 1124.50] Yeah.
[1124.86 → 1126.38] You know that seems to be the trend.
[1126.46 → 1126.88] And also.
[1127.22 → 1128.60] Apple's doing things that.
[1129.20 → 1129.86] Proportionally less.
[1130.32 → 1130.66] Yes.
[1130.66 → 1131.36] And it's also.
[1131.48 → 1132.90] This is going on to a completely different rant.
[1133.00 → 1134.56] Maybe we'll save it for the aftershow.
[1134.92 → 1135.86] Or later.
[1135.96 → 1136.38] Something like that.
[1136.44 → 1136.66] But also.
[1137.38 → 1138.64] Everything that Steve Jobs did.
[1138.82 → 1139.48] Was successful.
[1139.74 → 1141.10] And everything he said not to do.
[1141.10 → 1142.18] Was not successful.
[1142.44 → 1144.28] They are now doing what he said not to do.
[1144.66 → 1144.94] So.
[1145.36 → 1146.46] We'll see how it works out.
[1146.56 → 1146.72] That's.
[1146.82 → 1147.08] You know.
[1147.14 → 1148.86] We could dive into that topic for the rest of the show.
[1148.92 → 1149.42] If we wanted to.
[1149.54 → 1149.74] But.
[1150.66 → 1151.00] It's.
[1151.10 → 1151.26] You know.
[1151.34 → 1152.86] Like the 5C is what I'm referring to.
[1152.98 → 1153.12] Yeah.
[1153.12 → 1156.12] He said they would never release a budget iPhone.
[1156.20 → 1158.88] They also said he would never release a mini tablet.
[1158.98 → 1159.56] I don't remember that.
[1159.56 → 1159.82] What he said.
[1159.90 → 1160.68] Like under a certain size.
[1161.26 → 1162.78] The iPad Mini is.
[1163.02 → 1164.18] An exact contradiction to that.
[1164.58 → 1164.86] So.
[1165.70 → 1166.64] We'll see how it works.
[1166.88 → 1167.12] You know.
[1167.26 → 1167.94] We'll see how it works.
[1168.00 → 1169.32] And we'll see how the 5C does.
[1169.68 → 1170.74] I know it's slated at.
[1171.10 → 1172.44] We're completely jumping away from size.
[1172.44 → 1174.66] I know it's slated at about a hundred dollar price.
[1175.08 → 1175.94] Which is not bad.
[1176.02 → 1177.14] Basically it's a 5.
[1177.42 → 1181.98] An iPhone 5 with a colourful back that you're going to not see once you buy a case.
[1183.66 → 1184.84] Or if you get their mesh case.
[1184.94 → 1187.88] It can be like a polka dot colourful back that doesn't protect your phone.
[1188.26 → 1188.44] Exactly.
[1188.44 → 1188.62] Woo.
[1189.50 → 1192.32] I'm excited to get into one of our topics later on.
[1192.44 → 1194.50] Which we might actually have time for now.
[1194.60 → 1198.00] Did you put the vulnerabilities' thing in the document?
[1199.00 → 1199.64] If not.
[1199.66 → 1200.70] I did not put the links.
[1201.04 → 1201.78] Although I can.
[1201.90 → 1202.60] We can keep talking.
[1202.66 → 1203.50] I can navigate there.
[1203.62 → 1204.72] You work on that.
[1204.78 → 1206.12] And then we'll switch to your screen when we can.
[1206.28 → 1206.64] So.
[1206.80 → 1211.26] There's been a bunch of security problems with iOS 7 already.
[1211.64 → 1213.70] One of the easiest things is.
[1214.02 → 1214.44] You can.
[1214.62 → 1215.82] If you're on the lock screen.
[1215.82 → 1217.64] You can pull up something that I don't remember the name of.
[1218.16 → 1218.86] Do you remember the name of it?
[1219.58 → 1221.16] That is actually in the dock.
[1221.30 → 1222.62] That's probably the only thing.
[1222.90 → 1223.72] I can put it in the dock.
[1223.80 → 1224.82] That works for me.
[1225.04 → 1225.28] But.
[1226.52 → 1227.58] It's called Control Centre.
[1227.58 → 1228.40] So you pull up.
[1228.40 → 1228.54] Yeah.
[1228.60 → 1229.92] You pull up the Apple Control Centre.
[1230.28 → 1232.30] And then you're able to do minor things through your phone from there.
[1232.36 → 1233.50] So you can access the camera?
[1234.28 → 1234.64] Yes.
[1234.66 → 1235.24] You can access.
[1235.52 → 1237.90] Well actually what you do is you open the calculator.
[1238.26 → 1238.62] Calculator.
[1238.72 → 1240.50] And then you hold the power button down.
[1240.54 → 1240.76] Right.
[1241.02 → 1242.08] And then you hit cancel.
[1242.60 → 1245.60] And then that allows you to see the multitasking menu.
[1246.00 → 1247.90] From the multitasking menu you can open the camera.
[1248.38 → 1250.66] Which is pretty well on all phones.
[1250.72 → 1251.42] Android phones as well.
[1251.46 → 1253.52] If you open the camera from a shortcut or something like that.
[1253.54 → 1254.40] It's a stripped down version.
[1254.76 → 1255.70] This is not a stripped down version.
[1255.70 → 1256.72] You can go into the gallery.
[1256.72 → 1257.50] You can see all the pictures.
[1257.86 → 1259.70] You can then say I want to email this picture.
[1260.44 → 1262.04] You can delete the picture from the email.
[1262.18 → 1263.02] You can delete the signature.
[1263.26 → 1264.62] You can email whoever you want.
[1264.74 → 1266.30] You can see their whole contact list.
[1266.66 → 1267.58] You can go to any contacts.
[1267.72 → 1269.82] See all the details for those contacts.
[1269.82 → 1273.62] So basically like you could email out all the contacts.
[1273.94 → 1274.68] You could.
[1274.78 → 1275.62] Or take them all.
[1275.68 → 1276.48] Or take them all.
[1276.64 → 1276.82] Yep.
[1277.14 → 1283.96] You could email out to yourself or some third party that should not get these things.
[1284.04 → 1284.58] All the pictures.
[1285.10 → 1290.32] Or you could go to email a picture and delete the picture and then impersonate that person.
[1290.74 → 1292.02] So it's not very good right now.
[1292.10 → 1293.36] Apple is aware of this.
[1293.36 → 1295.00] And there's a fairly easy fix.
[1295.00 → 1296.32] If you go into your iPhone.
[1296.58 → 1297.00] Or yeah.
[1297.14 → 1297.90] If you go into your iPhone.
[1298.04 → 1299.78] You can disable that menu pull up.
[1299.98 → 1300.08] Yeah.
[1300.08 → 1301.00] And then that.
[1301.82 → 1302.52] That's fine.
[1302.74 → 1302.94] That will.
[1303.02 → 1303.14] Yeah.
[1303.14 → 1303.44] That will.
[1303.44 → 1304.18] You'll get fired at that point.
[1304.52 → 1306.00] It's no longer a security violation.
[1306.44 → 1308.18] So if you have an iPhone.
[1308.36 → 1310.82] I would highly recommend going in disabling that right now.
[1311.04 → 1312.28] And Apple will fix it later.
[1312.42 → 1313.68] I'm not too worried about this.
[1313.92 → 1315.54] But for the people that don't know.
[1315.66 → 1316.78] It's actually kind of a problem.
[1316.78 → 1317.82] Because if you don't know.
[1318.02 → 1318.96] And you leave it on.
[1319.14 → 1320.16] And someone gets to your phone.
[1320.42 → 1322.62] It's super easy for them to break into your phone.
[1322.74 → 1324.34] Which is kind of unfortunate.
[1324.86 → 1327.76] That might even be all we have to cover for that.
[1327.86 → 1329.36] There was some other security issues though.
[1329.38 → 1329.74] Wasn't there?
[1331.04 → 1332.46] There was the battery life issue.
[1332.82 → 1333.48] Battery life issue.
[1333.56 → 1333.68] Right.
[1333.76 → 1334.88] I was reading on Twitter today.
[1335.22 → 1337.16] That there are a lot of issues with the battery life.
[1337.24 → 1337.60] We looked up.
[1337.68 → 1338.48] Apparently it is an issue.
[1338.98 → 1339.92] So some users.
[1340.02 → 1340.60] Not all users.
[1340.68 → 1342.34] It's not a widespread thing.
[1342.38 → 1344.90] But some users are experiencing extreme battery drain.
[1345.26 → 1348.26] I've also read that even another select group of users.
[1348.48 → 1350.02] Once their battery hits 20%.
[1350.02 → 1351.50] Their phone just turns off.
[1351.68 → 1352.72] Says out of battery.
[1352.82 → 1353.26] Out of power.
[1353.36 → 1355.82] And turns off whenever it's at 20%.
[1355.82 → 1357.26] So that's a pretty.
[1358.12 → 1359.04] Pretty frustrating.
[1359.04 → 1360.12] It's kind of crazy.
[1360.12 → 1362.22] Because some of these things are like.
[1362.56 → 1364.50] Like how did QA not pick that up?
[1364.76 → 1366.36] Like the button thing on the main menu.
[1366.48 → 1368.34] Like that's one of the first things you ever try to do.
[1368.48 → 1369.44] With security violations.
[1369.76 → 1371.40] Is what menu can I get to?
[1371.68 → 1372.02] Okay.
[1372.32 → 1372.92] Now I'm here.
[1373.14 → 1375.38] What are all the different functions I could possibly do.
[1375.50 → 1377.44] That might give me higher rights access to anything.
[1377.94 → 1378.44] Like how.
[1378.64 → 1379.36] That's like.
[1380.02 → 1381.10] Step one and two.
[1381.42 → 1383.76] Of testing security violations for software.
[1383.96 → 1385.32] How did you not catch that?
[1385.32 → 1386.82] That one's a little bit crazy.
[1387.20 → 1388.10] The battery thing.
[1388.54 → 1390.36] Maybe they should have tested on more phones.
[1390.78 → 1393.16] Or maybe they should have tested on used phones a little bit.
[1393.28 → 1395.84] Because I'm wondering if this is maybe a used phone issue.
[1396.10 → 1396.32] Maybe.
[1396.80 → 1398.52] Or like just older models.
[1398.66 → 1398.78] Yeah.
[1398.78 → 1400.70] I didn't read what actual models.
[1400.70 → 1401.92] It just said those upgrading.
[1402.04 → 1403.30] Which I believe the 4S.
[1403.40 → 1403.86] The 4.
[1404.72 → 1405.70] As far as I know.
[1405.82 → 1407.04] Can get iOS 7.
[1407.10 → 1407.36] Right.
[1407.46 → 1407.64] Yeah.
[1407.64 → 1410.92] I imagine the 3GS can't.
[1411.10 → 1413.38] But phones from Apple should be able to.
[1413.54 → 1415.02] And that's quite old at that point.
[1415.14 → 1415.50] Very old.
[1415.50 → 1415.58] Basically.
[1415.88 → 1418.10] So you're getting to a point where it might not even be.
[1418.84 → 1419.64] Like good.
[1420.00 → 1421.34] To upgrade your phone at that point.
[1421.40 → 1422.20] Because you're just like.
[1422.62 → 1423.82] Throwing way too much stuff.
[1423.86 → 1423.98] Yeah.
[1423.98 → 1425.46] At this old piece of hardware.
[1425.64 → 1427.00] Which is probably just not a good idea.
[1428.18 → 1429.00] To jump.
[1429.58 → 1431.44] Back to Cyanogen mod.
[1433.52 → 1433.92] Sorry.
[1434.06 → 1434.80] One quick second.
[1434.80 → 1437.38] They're also planning on rebranding themselves.
[1437.52 → 1439.34] Now this is kind of a big deal in my mind.
[1439.48 → 1442.54] Because when you're a huge group like this.
[1442.56 → 1444.42] And you already have established your name.
[1444.82 → 1446.32] It's interesting to rename.
[1447.10 → 1447.30] Yeah.
[1447.90 → 1448.16] Yeah.
[1448.34 → 1450.28] Now one of the advantages that they have.
[1450.62 → 1453.12] Is they're a mobile company.
[1453.86 → 1455.70] So if they rename themselves.
[1455.88 → 1457.48] They'll be all over mobile news.
[1457.76 → 1459.02] Which is like one of the biggest.
[1459.80 → 1461.80] News buzzy things there is right now.
[1461.84 → 1462.14] Absolutely.
[1462.14 → 1463.86] So even if they have to rename themselves.
[1463.86 → 1465.00] They're probably fine.
[1465.62 → 1467.32] So it's not probably not that big of a deal.
[1467.42 → 1469.14] But I hope they don't rename themselves.
[1469.14 → 1471.74] To something completely off the wall and different.
[1472.44 → 1474.74] What I hope that they do personally.
[1474.90 → 1475.36] Which I don't know.
[1475.44 → 1477.32] There might be some other company named this or something.
[1477.60 → 1479.42] But I hope they just go with like Cyano.
[1479.96 → 1480.54] Or something.
[1480.72 → 1481.70] So that it's close.
[1481.84 → 1482.88] And still super recognizable.
[1482.88 → 1484.98] For the people that are following it right now.
[1485.86 → 1486.98] And not scary.
[1487.08 → 1488.82] Because Cyanogen mod.
[1489.14 → 1491.74] If you say that to someone who's not super techie.
[1491.82 → 1493.14] That kind of sounds scary.
[1493.14 → 1493.88] Sounds hardcore.
[1494.12 → 1494.32] Yeah.
[1494.42 → 1494.96] It's hardcore.
[1495.12 → 1495.20] It's aggressive.
[1495.20 → 1496.46] Even if you are techie it sounds hardcore.
[1496.54 → 1496.78] Yeah.
[1497.22 → 1498.18] It's like sweet.
[1498.52 → 1499.38] Cyanogen mod.
[1499.94 → 1500.28] Yeah.
[1500.88 → 1502.16] But like Cyano.
[1502.96 → 1504.40] Doesn't sound hardcore or aggressive.
[1504.76 → 1506.84] But still references to the previous name.
[1507.16 → 1507.76] So personally.
[1507.94 → 1509.14] Or Cyano.
[1509.56 → 1509.74] Wait.
[1509.78 → 1510.80] Is that what they're actually naming it?
[1511.28 → 1512.64] I heard that rumour.
[1512.74 → 1513.10] I didn't want to.
[1513.16 → 1514.86] Because I think that's a rumour.
[1514.98 → 1516.92] But he could be very well correct.
[1517.00 → 1518.82] Is that Apple Fanboy.
[1518.90 → 1520.08] That's funny coming from Apple Fanboy.
[1520.08 → 1520.28] So.
[1521.86 → 1522.22] But.
[1522.68 → 1523.62] I heard that.
[1523.68 → 1525.52] I did see that on the Internets today.
[1525.84 → 1528.44] But I have no idea if there's a shredded truth to that or not.
[1528.64 → 1528.92] Okay.
[1529.02 → 1530.76] I haven't seen any updates about that.
[1531.06 → 1532.62] But Cyano S would be perfect.
[1532.76 → 1534.08] Because then you still have Cyano.
[1534.66 → 1535.94] And you just add an S on it.
[1536.06 → 1537.52] And then it's still very recognizable.
[1537.52 → 1538.16] It's easy to say.
[1539.04 → 1539.58] It's just.
[1539.68 → 1540.44] That's kind of awesome.
[1540.54 → 1541.42] So hopefully they go with that.
[1541.54 → 1543.22] I just want it to still be recognizable.
[1543.60 → 1543.82] Yeah.
[1543.94 → 1544.90] That's all I really want it to be.
[1545.10 → 1547.22] I see quite a few people asking who this is.
[1547.26 → 1547.88] This is my brother.
[1547.98 → 1548.98] Also known as Colds.
[1549.30 → 1550.62] He's a Star Craft caster.
[1550.88 → 1552.00] And he's joining us today.
[1552.24 → 1554.24] In lieu of Linus being in Hawaii.
[1554.72 → 1555.12] Because.
[1556.52 → 1557.84] Linus has to be in Hawaii.
[1558.06 → 1559.90] I don't even really know what else to say about that.
[1560.54 → 1562.32] I'm going to conference with my mods.
[1562.32 → 1564.32] And try and get them to line up quickly.
[1565.46 → 1567.32] Because anyone who was wondering.
[1567.84 → 1570.28] The guests for this week will be the mods.
[1570.28 → 1574.02] So the topics we will have for the mods.
[1574.12 → 1575.62] Are all focused around the forum.
[1576.18 → 1578.28] There's a bunch of leaks.
[1578.28 → 1579.68] That I'm going to drop about the forum.
[1580.10 → 1582.62] That Linus wasn't necessarily super happy about.
[1582.70 → 1583.96] But Linus isn't here this week.
[1584.16 → 1586.86] And I'm the one that works on the forum.
[1586.86 → 1587.96] Along with my mod team.
[1588.14 → 1588.78] And Mr. Wizard.
[1589.08 → 1590.16] And Cayman.
[1590.26 → 1592.46] Which no one's necessarily heard of.
[1592.52 → 1593.52] As being part of the team.
[1593.62 → 1595.52] But we'll bring in his contribution.
[1595.90 → 1596.70] To the forum.
[1596.94 → 1598.02] In that topic as well.
[1598.10 → 1599.40] That will start very soon.
[1599.40 → 1600.56] Hopefully everyone's here.
[1600.74 → 1602.58] I've notified them that we're going live soon.
[1604.36 → 1606.70] And just a bunch of other stuff.
[1607.02 → 1608.66] That's going to be happening on the forum.
[1609.06 → 1611.28] In the few months coming up here.
[1611.46 → 1614.90] Hopefully faster than I'm hoping for.
[1614.96 → 1616.28] But it could take a little while.
[1616.54 → 1617.10] For all of them.
[1617.10 → 1619.78] So they're all in very early stages right now.
[1619.86 → 1620.56] But they're working.
[1621.70 → 1622.76] Leading up until now.
[1622.84 → 1624.20] All the stuff that I was going to release.
[1624.40 → 1625.10] Is not working.
[1625.44 → 1626.14] Don't buy the widgets.
[1627.32 → 1628.00] Stop it.
[1628.14 → 1628.98] Don't buy the widgets.
[1629.40 → 1631.50] Those of you that know what I'm talking about.
[1632.18 → 1632.98] Screw you.
[1633.64 → 1634.80] Don't buy the dang widgets.
[1635.10 → 1635.36] Okay.
[1635.50 → 1636.80] So I'm going to call the mod team.
[1636.88 → 1637.66] A little bit early.
[1637.96 → 1639.54] Just because we've pretty much finished up.
[1639.60 → 1641.22] Do you have any other comments about Simon Jenner iPhone?
[1641.96 → 1643.10] I'm sure we'll jump back to it.
[1643.12 → 1643.52] We'll, probably.
[1643.52 → 1644.22] Just kind of have it happen.
[1644.32 → 1644.56] Yeah.
[1644.82 → 1646.06] It's not surprising at all.
[1646.40 → 1646.66] So.
[1647.00 → 1648.32] Headphones on.
[1648.90 → 1649.48] Calling in.
[1649.54 → 1650.96] Don't buy gift cards or widgets.
[1651.78 → 1652.12] Okay.
[1653.14 → 1654.00] Calling everybody.
[1654.84 → 1656.40] We'll see who's all actually here.
[1656.40 → 1656.86] Not the widget.
[1659.18 → 1660.32] Oh my god.
[1660.84 → 1661.20] Okay.
[1662.20 → 1662.80] Who's connecting?
[1662.96 → 1664.00] We've got Dave.
[1664.12 → 1664.96] We've got Chris.
[1665.06 → 1665.68] We've got Dim.
[1666.76 → 1667.22] Is that true?
[1669.14 → 1669.98] Hello, hello.
[1669.98 → 1673.50] So the guy who just said hello, hello is Win speed on the forum.
[1674.22 → 1675.40] Dave, can you say hi?
[1676.86 → 1677.16] Hello.
[1677.68 → 1680.18] That's Dave with the smiley face on the forum.
[1680.36 → 1683.62] Which trolls the crap out of our forum search, which is hilarious.
[1684.02 → 1687.84] If you search for members and type in Dave, he's like the last one.
[1688.20 → 1688.68] Just because of his smiley face thing.
[1688.68 → 1690.82] That's probably what broke the forum search.
[1691.56 → 1692.04] Probably.
[1692.04 → 1693.78] It's all Dave.
[1694.28 → 1695.58] Mr. Wizard is right.
[1695.72 → 1696.50] It's all Dave's fault.
[1696.76 → 1698.18] It probably is all Dave's fault.
[1698.74 → 1701.24] So we are missing some people that will not show up.
[1701.26 → 1702.16] I think Wailer's here too.
[1702.32 → 1702.46] Yeah.
[1702.62 → 1702.80] Yeah.
[1702.86 → 1703.60] Wailer's here as well.
[1705.22 → 1706.02] Is Glenn here?
[1706.28 → 1707.20] It looks like Glenn's here.
[1707.56 → 1711.00] So it looks like we're missing Ending and Mr. Wizard.
[1711.34 → 1711.98] And Cayman.
[1712.34 → 1716.24] So Mr. Wizard is the other admin on the forum.
[1716.34 → 1718.92] For admins, there's Linus, myself, and Mr. Wizard.
[1718.92 → 1721.36] And a lot of people are like, who the heck is Mr. Wizard?
[1721.36 → 1728.34] Mr. Wizard is a buddy of mine that I went to school with that helps a ton with the deep, deep back end of the forum.
[1728.86 → 1733.76] So installing heavy applications, managing the database, a lot of that kind of stuff is Mr. Wizard.
[1734.16 → 1736.84] And he is a core part of the reason why we have a forum at all.
[1737.34 → 1740.64] Then there's Win speed, who is also a core part of the reason why we have a forum at all.
[1740.70 → 1745.42] Because he has paid for them and managed our hosting traditionally.
[1745.42 → 1751.54] So for a while there, the forum started at the very beginning when no one ever saw it.
[1751.92 → 1754.68] When Linus and I were planning on even possibly having a forum.
[1755.48 → 1759.50] I had a forum running PHP BB, which no one else saw except for me.
[1760.02 → 1761.42] And then Linus was like...
[1761.42 → 1761.90] I saw it.
[1762.00 → 1762.46] You saw it?
[1762.60 → 1763.24] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1763.32 → 1764.16] He saw it.
[1764.20 → 1764.58] Good point.
[1764.64 → 1765.02] Locally.
[1765.20 → 1765.92] Yeah, yeah.
[1766.30 → 1766.78] In person.
[1766.78 → 1770.50] And then Linus came around and was like, we're going to run V Bulletin.
[1770.84 → 1771.64] And that was terrible.
[1772.02 → 1772.08] Oh god.
[1773.14 → 1774.00] That was horrible.
[1774.46 → 1775.40] But we did it.
[1775.96 → 1780.02] And Mr. Wizard helped a lot in getting that installed because it was next to impossible.
[1780.48 → 1783.54] And that ended up actually being in some ways a good thing.
[1783.74 → 1787.86] Because I found mods who can pretty much deal with any problem we will ever have.
[1787.94 → 1790.66] Because they managed to do anything at all in V Bulletin.
[1791.00 → 1793.74] So that's fairly good in that form.
[1793.92 → 1795.64] But then also terrible because it was horrible.
[1795.64 → 1796.08] So...
[1796.08 → 1797.06] What's up?
[1797.58 → 1799.84] We're just getting slammed with lag.
[1801.00 → 1802.60] I have the stream going.
[1802.74 → 1803.84] I don't see lag personally.
[1804.06 → 1805.46] But there's a lot of...
[1805.46 → 1806.98] And we have some people saying there's no lag.
[1807.56 → 1808.30] Just a little concerned.
[1808.46 → 1809.50] Want to try to keep you guys happy.
[1809.88 → 1810.24] Lag.
[1810.70 → 1811.64] It's uh...
[1812.88 → 1813.96] Are we dropping anything?
[1815.30 → 1816.50] I don't think so.
[1817.20 → 1817.76] Sorry guys.
[1817.80 → 1820.22] I didn't mean to kind of like throw a big stop sign there.
[1820.42 → 1821.48] A lot of people are saying no lag.
[1821.64 → 1823.04] You know, we might as well keep going.
[1823.04 → 1824.46] We're not dropping on our side.
[1824.46 → 1824.80] Yeah.
[1825.64 → 1828.94] All right.
[1829.18 → 1831.04] Well, we're going to go for now because...
[1831.04 → 1832.72] InitsRevenge thinks it's CPU usage.
[1833.88 → 1834.24] Definitely.
[1834.56 → 1836.04] It's all the CPU usage.
[1837.48 → 1838.40] Chris, how are you going?
[1839.14 → 1839.98] So, yeah.
[1840.66 → 1841.12] I'm all right.
[1841.40 → 1842.64] I don't know where to go from there.
[1842.74 → 1844.12] Whaler is a big part of the forum.
[1844.20 → 1846.34] He's the folding leader guy.
[1846.44 → 1848.66] So if you have any questions about folding, go see him.
[1848.66 → 1852.52] Dim has been our ninja janitor for as long as I can remember.
[1853.52 → 1857.02] Dave was actually pretty much the first mod that I recruited.
[1857.80 → 1861.96] And how I recruited him was in the very, very early days of Bulletin.
[1862.06 → 1863.16] I didn't have any mods yet.
[1863.42 → 1866.16] And I like looked through a bunch of the people that had a good amount of posts.
[1866.20 → 1867.78] And I was like, he's a nice person.
[1868.28 → 1869.54] I'm going to go with him.
[1870.04 → 1870.96] And then I picked him as I...
[1870.96 → 1871.78] He's got to rescanning them posts.
[1871.94 → 1873.78] And it ended up being great, actually.
[1874.04 → 1877.00] And then Glenn was also just a super nice dude.
[1877.06 → 1879.12] He didn't have way too many posts.
[1879.18 → 1881.36] And I got a little bit of flack for that when I first recruited Glenn.
[1881.44 → 1885.72] When people were like, oh my god, I can't believe you picked a mod that didn't have that many posts, man.
[1885.72 → 1888.32] And I was like, dude, it's not about post count.
[1888.90 → 1891.68] And he's turned out to also be a pretty epic mod.
[1891.72 → 1892.64] And we just lost our call.
[1895.86 → 1899.52] Well, we're not lagging there yet.
[1899.84 → 1902.10] So I'm going to go into topics.
[1902.30 → 1903.32] If you can jump...
[1903.32 → 1904.12] And we're still recording.
[1904.38 → 1906.88] If you can jump to the doc real quick.
[1908.18 → 1911.76] So the first one is HTTPS is now on the forum.
[1911.76 → 1920.38] So anyone that browses from a hotspot of some sort or a coffee shop or something like that,
[1920.92 → 1924.44] your login information and stuff like that is secure now.
[1924.86 → 1926.42] So that was a problem before.
[1926.94 → 1929.46] There's not that many other tech sites that have this.
[1929.86 → 1936.08] But when we started getting people asking, like, hey, I browsed the forum from school, or I browsed the forum from a café.
[1936.88 → 1939.60] And I'm worried about stuff like my login getting leaked.
[1940.02 → 1941.64] We decided to implement it.
[1941.76 → 1943.60] And there's also some other stuff coming in.
[1943.80 → 1944.62] Video's lagging.
[1945.66 → 1947.26] Getting a lot of comments on the lag.
[1947.34 → 1948.34] A lot of video lagging.
[1948.98 → 1950.34] Is B-Roll around?
[1953.04 → 1954.34] B-Roll, I think, is around.
[1954.42 → 1955.40] It's not lagging here.
[1956.28 → 1957.18] See, there you go.
[1957.54 → 1958.40] Oh, it is lagging here.
[1959.42 → 1960.40] A little bit of shuddering.
[1962.50 → 1964.30] Is the audio still fine?
[1965.34 → 1967.92] If audio's still fine, we're just going to keep powering through.
[1968.26 → 1969.82] So sorry about that, guys.
[1969.82 → 1970.98] But we're just going to keep powering through.
[1971.10 → 1972.90] So we have HTTPS now on the forum.
[1973.28 → 1978.54] And now another reason, what really spurred us to get it was the vulnerability on hotspots.
[1978.54 → 1994.66] But another reason why we had to get it and why we've been looking into getting it for a while, we just pushed it out a little bit earlier because of the hotspot problems, was that we have now installed something called IP. Nexus, which is a part of the Envision Power Services suite, which allows us to have a store.
[1994.66 → 1997.24] Now we can sell Linus Tech Tips merchandise through this.
[1997.34 → 1999.82] We can sell things that we've reviewed through this.
[2000.10 → 2005.46] And another thing that we can do is implement the classified section, which we've been working on for a long time.
[2005.46 → 2011.06] And the classified section will allow users to BST, buy, sell, trade.
[2011.28 → 2015.98] You will be able to set up your own sales page, basically.
[2016.16 → 2021.90] And we're going to try and have a reputation thing built in where people can review sellers so they can be like, oh, yeah, it showed up on time.
[2021.98 → 2023.42] It was in great condition, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2024.32 → 2025.52] Five stars, whatever.
[2025.66 → 2028.32] We're going to try and have some system like that in place.
[2028.38 → 2029.58] I'm not sure exactly how that will work.
[2029.58 → 2033.36] But basically, buy, sell, trade is coming to the forum, and it will be encrypted.
[2033.72 → 2033.76] How cool is that?
[2033.76 → 2034.66] Buy, sell, trade.
[2034.72 → 2035.22] Buy, sell, trade.
[2035.22 → 2035.64] For a bunch of tech guys.
[2035.66 → 2036.78] And a classified section.
[2037.06 → 2039.68] So a lot of websites have a buy, sell, trade forum section.
[2039.90 → 2043.66] But we want you to be able to actually set up what looks more like an ad page.
[2043.88 → 2047.12] So you can show off the product a little bit better and all that kind of stuff.
[2047.30 → 2047.58] So that...
[2048.52 → 2050.06] I just sold a case off Craigslist.
[2050.44 → 2050.64] Yeah.
[2050.80 → 2052.06] The experience could have been better.
[2052.46 → 2053.02] It could have.
[2053.14 → 2057.04] It wasn't terrible, but something like this would be an excellent way to do it.
[2057.04 → 2057.96] And we want to...
[2057.96 → 2058.08] Yeah.
[2058.32 → 2063.68] And to add to that experience that you could have had, hopefully, if you sold it through our website,
[2064.14 → 2066.48] is there will hopefully be a reputation system.
[2066.76 → 2068.66] So you won't be selling to some random dude.
[2069.24 → 2070.90] So the reputation system goes both ways.
[2071.00 → 2073.38] The guy that's buying it from you, you can see his forum account.
[2073.48 → 2074.68] It's tying in directly with our forum.
[2074.88 → 2077.36] So you can see all of his previous posts.
[2077.48 → 2080.00] If he's a big troll, maybe you don't sell to him.
[2080.14 → 2080.26] Yeah.
[2080.34 → 2082.86] So then you wouldn't have to worry about that when you were buying off of...
[2082.86 → 2083.94] Or selling off of Craigslist.
[2083.94 → 2086.58] You can just get a glimpse into their characters, actually.
[2086.58 → 2087.14] Exactly.
[2087.44 → 2090.92] And if you're like, oh, this isn't someone that I really want to trust to send me money.
[2091.58 → 2095.58] But once they get this thing or however you guys end up doing that, it's...
[2096.42 → 2097.70] Yeah, it'll be better that way.
[2097.76 → 2098.84] Are we getting audio lag now?
[2102.88 → 2103.28] Nope.
[2103.66 → 2104.26] Audio's fine.
[2104.34 → 2104.58] Okay.
[2104.72 → 2105.72] We're going to keep trucking on.
[2106.16 → 2108.60] So classifieds is pretty awesome.
[2108.82 → 2110.94] And we've been working on classifieds and Nexus for a while.
[2110.94 → 2113.76] And it's finally installed and finally working.
[2113.90 → 2118.08] Now, can I get you to bring up the image linked in that section in the dock?
[2118.68 → 2119.04] Boom.
[2119.10 → 2119.52] Right there.
[2120.54 → 2122.18] And then maybe zoom in a wee bit.
[2122.28 → 2122.44] Nope.
[2122.50 → 2123.48] That should be fine, actually.
[2123.48 → 2128.38] So, we have another little leak to come out.
[2128.48 → 2132.72] This will probably lag a little bit, but it's a static image, so it should probably be fine.
[2133.14 → 2134.80] So I'm going to switch to it now.
[2134.94 → 2139.74] And then hopefully the video will catch up at some point, at least a little bit.
[2140.10 → 2141.66] And then you guys will be able to see it.
[2141.66 → 2146.62] I'm actually going to try and move this out of the way, so people can see better.
[2147.44 → 2148.18] There we go.
[2148.30 → 2150.00] So the video will hopefully catch up soon.
[2150.40 → 2156.94] This is a still shot image of the theme that we're going to be using on the forum.
[2157.54 → 2159.26] I see a few people going, whoa.
[2159.56 → 2161.16] Yeah, this is the theme coming up.
[2161.38 → 2164.60] This is what I'm going to be calling the new Linus Tech Tips day theme.
[2164.84 → 2168.08] We are also going to be working on a new Linus Tech Tips night theme.
[2168.08 → 2173.48] And if I can push Cayman to do it, I'm going to try and have mirrors of these themes on mobile.
[2173.84 → 2178.20] So we'll have a day and night orange and gray and black theme on mobile as well.
[2178.32 → 2182.06] We've been asked for this on the forum for a long time.
[2183.20 → 2183.96] Oh, sorry.
[2184.90 → 2185.30] Sorry.
[2186.72 → 2190.78] We've been asked, like, people have wanted this for a long time.
[2191.02 → 2195.02] Because we've had stock theme, and we look just like a lot of other sites that are out there
[2195.02 → 2197.62] that have the stock IPS theme.
[2198.08 → 2201.36] So, yeah, in my opinion, it looks fantastic.
[2201.50 → 2206.74] The banner image along the top, not the logo, but the image along the top, will very likely change.
[2207.26 → 2209.82] That's just a filler image for now.
[2209.94 → 2212.12] But everything else is pretty much going to stay the same.
[2212.20 → 2214.46] Other than that, it will be very minor changes that you probably won't notice.
[2214.56 → 2216.96] I think you were saying it could be a dynamic as well.
[2217.00 → 2217.92] It could change constantly.
[2218.74 → 2220.90] I don't think it will be like a slideshow change.
[2221.26 → 2223.32] But like every day, week?
[2223.32 → 2223.72] Sure.
[2223.90 → 2224.06] Yeah.
[2224.68 → 2225.94] And we might be doing that.
[2226.02 → 2229.16] It might be, like, relevant to new products that are coming out.
[2229.22 → 2230.58] It might be relevant to certain brands.
[2230.66 → 2231.98] It might be relevant to whatever.
[2232.24 → 2233.76] It's very simple to change.
[2233.82 → 2234.84] So I can change it on the fly.
[2235.10 → 2235.86] Did we get the callback?
[2235.86 → 2238.62] I think we did get the callback, actually.
[2238.98 → 2241.30] I think there are some problems.
[2242.30 → 2245.02] I think we might have one or two guys here, but there are some problems.
[2245.10 → 2245.62] We got somebody.
[2245.72 → 2246.32] I can hear somebody.
[2246.56 → 2249.50] Yeah, we're having some problems with the call, so sorry about that, guys.
[2250.10 → 2252.44] And I think we might still be having some problems.
[2252.46 → 2253.86] Someone said Day9 sent them here.
[2254.38 → 2254.70] Did they?
[2255.28 → 2256.18] That would be awesome.
[2256.58 → 2257.68] Because of the Day9 shirt?
[2257.68 → 2262.74] I've worn this shirt on stream so many times that he's never sent people before.
[2263.46 → 2266.70] Anyway, for the Day9 viewers, this is Colds on Twitter.
[2266.82 → 2270.02] He does Star Craft stuff, so follow him if you want to see more stuff from him.
[2270.44 → 2272.68] And we are currently showing off the...
[2272.68 → 2274.16] Jeez, I just...
[2274.16 → 2275.68] Viewing some other webpage again.
[2275.70 → 2276.62] I'm so terrible.
[2276.74 → 2278.14] Just too excited to see Day9 stuff.
[2278.38 → 2278.90] I'm sorry.
[2278.90 → 2280.10] Um...
[2280.10 → 2280.90] This is the new...
[2280.90 → 2282.96] You know, people were actually asking if I stole your shirt.
[2283.54 → 2283.88] No!
[2284.24 → 2286.78] He actually got me this shirt for Christmas.
[2287.52 → 2289.20] So, props to him.
[2289.20 → 2289.78] Not this shirt.
[2289.86 → 2290.28] Your shirt.
[2290.32 → 2291.08] Well, yeah.
[2291.14 → 2291.98] There's two of the shirts.
[2292.00 → 2292.14] There's two.
[2292.24 → 2295.36] He has his own shirt, if that was the part that people didn't understand.
[2295.68 → 2299.18] But yeah, I got the shirt because he bought two of the shirt and gave me one of them.
[2299.52 → 2300.60] So that was actually pretty awesome.
[2300.66 → 2301.56] It's one of my favourite shirts.
[2301.72 → 2302.86] People are saying Day9.
[2303.80 → 2304.90] That can't be true.
[2306.12 → 2307.48] I think it must be.
[2307.58 → 2308.52] Let's see for one quick second.
[2308.52 → 2311.78] I'm actually so stoked because we're both really, huge fans.
[2312.06 → 2312.48] Huge.
[2312.58 → 2314.74] I turned into a 14-year-old little girl at Day9.
[2314.94 → 2315.70] We, uh...
[2315.70 → 2317.40] At PAX two years ago?
[2318.00 → 2321.06] At PAX two years ago, we went to the Red Bull LAN.
[2321.60 → 2322.00] And...
[2322.00 → 2325.50] And we got to meet Day9 at the Red Bull LAN.
[2325.58 → 2327.12] And that was probably one of the coolest experiences ever.
[2327.14 → 2327.38] Absolutely.
[2327.58 → 2330.92] If you haven't met Day9 yet, he, like...
[2330.92 → 2336.44] When I ever go out and meet, like, members of the community, I try to be as cool as he is.
[2336.44 → 2339.76] And I never make it, but I try as bad as I can, as hard as I can, I mean.
[2340.26 → 2342.32] Because he's just the coolest dude ever.
[2342.44 → 2343.28] He's super chill.
[2343.70 → 2348.82] And he will always make you feel invited and just generally just a good experience.
[2348.96 → 2351.74] Like, you were describing that thing that he does when you walk up to people.
[2351.74 → 2354.56] Yeah, it's, it's, um...
[2354.56 → 2356.64] I just always, I like to watch people's body language.
[2356.74 → 2358.42] And someone even commented that I'm not moving much.
[2358.48 → 2359.70] It's because I'm totally nervous right now.
[2359.94 → 2362.34] And all of my casting, I don't have a camera.
[2362.70 → 2364.38] So I love casting Star Craft.
[2364.46 → 2365.42] I love talking about Star Craft.
[2365.84 → 2366.86] No one is looking at me.
[2367.04 → 2369.12] So it's kind of, you know, it's a little bit different.
[2369.32 → 2371.30] But I'll try to start being a little more natural.
[2371.38 → 2372.06] Because I'm like you.
[2372.12 → 2373.18] We're both hand talkers.
[2373.24 → 2374.22] But now I'm scared.
[2374.34 → 2375.58] So I'm kind of sitting here not moving much.
[2376.00 → 2380.70] But he would, when people would walk up to him, they had to kind of cross a gap.
[2381.16 → 2381.96] And they would walk.
[2382.04 → 2385.02] And you're kind of, when you, when you walk up, it's hard, it's hard to describe.
[2385.12 → 2385.82] But I've always watched people's body language.
[2385.82 → 2386.84] It makes an awkward space.
[2386.90 → 2387.14] Yeah.
[2387.34 → 2389.20] You walk up and there's kind of that engagement.
[2389.36 → 2391.24] What Day9 would do is he would step, or Sean.
[2391.66 → 2394.30] We're not on first name basis, but yes.
[2394.66 → 2394.70] Sean.
[2395.22 → 2396.04] Mr. Day9.
[2396.06 → 2396.86] Sean Plot.
[2397.42 → 2399.16] He would take a step to the right.
[2399.16 → 2401.00] And then that person would kind of naturally.
[2401.40 → 2403.42] And just, it doesn't sound like much.
[2403.54 → 2404.40] But you have to try it.
[2404.42 → 2405.36] It's something you have to try.
[2405.58 → 2406.62] It resets the floor.
[2406.70 → 2407.88] It just resets the angle.
[2408.04 → 2409.62] It resets the focus.
[2409.96 → 2410.12] Yeah.
[2410.28 → 2413.48] And it really feels like he's engaging you.
[2413.66 → 2417.82] And he's, he is my favourite celebrity, period.
[2418.06 → 2418.40] Oh, yeah.
[2418.48 → 2418.76] Out of.
[2418.76 → 2419.94] I would totally be down for that.
[2420.16 → 2421.40] I've worn his shirts before.
[2421.48 → 2422.40] Everyone's seen that kind of stuff.
[2422.68 → 2428.02] So you can check him out, as I'm sure most of you know, due to the fact that you were
[2428.02 → 2431.80] sent over here, at, I believe, twitch.tv slash day.
[2432.52 → 2434.08] Or I think you just go to day.
[2434.28 → 2435.04] day9.tv.
[2435.72 → 2436.86] I always go from a link.
[2436.92 → 2437.68] I'm trying to remember right now.
[2437.72 → 2440.78] I actually just watched pretty well every episode of all his Hearthstone stuff.
[2441.70 → 2441.98] Yeah.
[2441.98 → 2442.76] Which was really cool.
[2442.86 → 2443.60] All, all on YouTube.
[2443.70 → 2445.00] Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see it live.
[2445.10 → 2446.50] But I did watch it all on.
[2450.88 → 2451.52] Day9!
[2452.00 → 2452.88] How's it going?
[2453.10 → 2454.18] That's so cool.
[2455.18 → 2455.54] Damn.
[2455.54 → 2456.18] Okay.
[2456.18 → 2459.48] We have to keep, like, talking about stuff and stop fanboying over Day9.
[2459.84 → 2462.24] Even though I just kind of want to sit here and fanboy over Day9.
[2462.40 → 2463.48] I'm going to change colours.
[2465.26 → 2466.68] It's going to completely wreck.
[2467.08 → 2468.60] Anyway, thanks for showing up, Day9.
[2468.68 → 2469.60] That's actually freaking cool.
[2469.80 → 2470.24] There we go.
[2470.48 → 2471.30] Day9.tv.
[2471.30 → 2472.90] You can get to his website there.
[2473.56 → 2474.86] Just totally legit guy.
[2474.96 → 2476.06] And he's apparently in the chat.
[2476.52 → 2477.16] So there we go.
[2477.20 → 2477.32] Yeah.
[2477.36 → 2478.22] That brings his website up.
[2478.26 → 2479.68] And you can find the stream really, really easily.
[2479.74 → 2483.04] My Twitter picture, for those of you who are checking out my...
[2483.04 → 2483.38] You know what?
[2483.40 → 2483.54] Okay.
[2483.58 → 2483.84] I'm fine.
[2483.84 → 2484.24] I'm going to...
[2484.24 → 2485.48] It's been on my screen for so long.
[2485.54 → 2485.84] I'll show you.
[2485.90 → 2486.12] Anyway.
[2486.26 → 2486.34] Yeah.
[2486.50 → 2488.42] My Twitter picture is still Day9 and I.
[2488.94 → 2490.68] That is one of my favourite pictures.
[2491.12 → 2494.52] And it has been my picture since I met him at Red Bull Land.
[2494.92 → 2496.54] Not this PAX, but the PAX before.
[2497.02 → 2497.26] Yep.
[2497.64 → 2499.42] So two PAX's ago, basically.
[2500.84 → 2501.56] You know what?
[2502.06 → 2503.82] Any actor could walk in the room.
[2503.82 → 2505.44] And I really wouldn't care that much.
[2505.58 → 2505.92] Yeah, no.
[2506.08 → 2509.32] My little 14-year-old girl heart is racing because Day9 said something.
[2511.30 → 2511.62] Okay.
[2511.62 → 2516.18] So, I guess we're supposed to get on with the show now?
[2517.02 → 2517.94] I guess.
[2520.12 → 2521.96] I'm just watching the chat like a hawk.
[2522.08 → 2524.14] I'm trying to do the Star Craft thing.
[2525.36 → 2526.02] Sup, son.
[2526.20 → 2526.68] Sup, son.
[2527.18 → 2528.24] We can fusion core dance.
[2528.52 → 2529.58] Oh, fusion core dance.
[2529.82 → 2530.14] You got to...
[2530.14 → 2530.56] It's not...
[2530.56 → 2531.02] Yeah, you got to...
[2531.02 → 2531.36] Whoa, no.
[2531.38 → 2532.74] You got to, like, wave a little bit.
[2533.34 → 2534.14] That's bad.
[2534.90 → 2535.28] All right.
[2535.48 → 2536.08] We'll be okay.
[2536.20 → 2536.82] What was that?
[2536.88 → 2537.46] That was water.
[2538.12 → 2539.04] But it's a wave.
[2539.04 → 2541.60] See, on one of his streams, he dropped chocolate milk into his pants.
[2541.86 → 2543.08] And the stream had to go on.
[2543.18 → 2544.42] So, we dropped water on the floor.
[2544.52 → 2546.06] The stream has to go on.
[2546.06 → 2546.14] But the stream must go on.
[2546.38 → 2553.06] So, the one last thing to bring up about the website that I can't show you guys, really,
[2553.38 → 2555.40] is a lot of different tech websites you'll notice.
[2555.72 → 2559.84] Once you go to the website, you get a landing page that has recent videos.
[2559.84 → 2564.80] Well, what we're going to have is recent videos that we have released and just recent news
[2564.80 → 2568.30] topics, recent, like, trending topics on the forum.
[2568.42 → 2571.08] We hope to have all that kind of stuff on a landing page at the very beginning.
[2571.56 → 2574.22] And then from there, you can navigate to the forum.
[2574.32 → 2578.68] So, you guys will still be able to bookmark or put little widgets where you can get to
[2578.68 → 2582.08] the forum directly or have it redirect on your own end.
[2582.08 → 2585.54] But we will have the homepage eventually as a landing page instead of the forum.
[2585.54 → 2587.40] You're going to be able to easily navigate there.
[2587.60 → 2593.24] But that is probably the farthest thing away from being complete because we need to get
[2593.24 → 2595.04] some stylized stuff going on.
[2595.14 → 2598.24] So, Mr. Wizard's got a lot of work to do because he's perfect at PHP.
[2598.24 → 2603.34] So, we're going to have him work on the PHP side of things and hopefully get all that
[2603.34 → 2604.58] done as soon as possible.
[2604.70 → 2606.90] But like I said, it is going to take a while.
[2607.22 → 2609.50] Now, this segment was supposed to take a lot longer.
[2610.40 → 2615.74] But we were having some problems with lags and the call with our mods got completely killed.
[2616.82 → 2617.26] So...
[2617.26 → 2618.30] Yeah, that's okay.
[2619.12 → 2620.14] I'm sorry, mods.
[2622.24 → 2626.60] But I guess I can't actually talk to you guys.
[2626.60 → 2628.90] Let's see if they've said anything in our little conversation.
[2630.98 → 2631.94] Doesn't look like it.
[2632.04 → 2632.62] Sorry, guys.
[2632.68 → 2635.36] If you want to hit up the mods on the forum, there's quite a few of them.
[2635.38 → 2636.40] It's really easy to find.
[2637.72 → 2638.60] It's like join.
[2639.42 → 2640.08] Works fine.
[2640.26 → 2640.52] Okay.
[2640.64 → 2641.50] I'm going to join back.
[2641.64 → 2642.62] See if we can talk to them.
[2644.64 → 2645.44] Hello, everybody.
[2648.62 → 2650.72] I'm still freaking out that Day9 said something.
[2652.22 → 2653.32] Can you guys hear him?
[2653.32 → 2657.40] I can't hear anything.
[2657.96 → 2658.76] I can't hear anything either.
[2658.84 → 2659.92] And then it just closed again.
[2660.50 → 2663.48] So it's actually not working on our end, guys.
[2663.66 → 2664.54] Sorry about that.
[2664.96 → 2665.92] Can I mod Day9?
[2665.98 → 2667.70] I would be completely down to mod Day9.
[2667.80 → 2669.58] But I don't think I'm logged in under anything.
[2670.58 → 2671.32] Let's go...
[2671.32 → 2677.26] Switch TV.
[2677.62 → 2678.78] I haven't seen him say anything.
[2678.98 → 2679.32] He might...
[2679.98 → 2681.86] Might not be here anymore or something.
[2682.02 → 2682.64] We're not really sure.
[2682.66 → 2684.14] He does do about a million things.
[2684.26 → 2688.64] He is a man that completely avoids sleep due to the fact that it is unproductive for esports.
[2689.90 → 2691.68] He is that kind of individual.
[2691.96 → 2693.24] He has more inner strength than...
[2693.24 → 2694.82] Day9, white knight for esports.
[2694.82 → 2696.70] I can't...
[2696.70 → 2699.04] I have no logins here to mod Day9.
[2699.20 → 2701.92] But on my channel, I would and probably will.
[2702.02 → 2704.16] But he probably won't show up there because I am small.
[2704.92 → 2705.36] Anyway.
[2705.70 → 2708.22] But we're going to jump down into more topics.
[2708.32 → 2710.88] Again, sorry that we couldn't really get the mod team on here.
[2711.20 → 2715.18] We are having a lot of problems with our communications setup.
[2715.60 → 2716.38] It is very new.
[2717.04 → 2718.98] And having some problems with our internet, I think.
[2719.06 → 2720.16] But we will make it through.
[2720.64 → 2723.48] My laptop's going to die, but I can fix that problem quite quickly.
[2723.48 → 2723.92] Boom.
[2724.10 → 2724.32] Alright.
[2724.60 → 2731.02] So the next topic, if you can bring it up, is damages that Hyde's DRAM plant are actually quite serious.
[2731.18 → 2732.62] We talked about this last live stream.
[2733.12 → 2736.54] And it wasn't really that big of a deal we thought at the time.
[2736.94 → 2743.14] And in my opinion, it's still not as big of a deal as, say, the hard drive problems we had not that long ago.
[2743.20 → 2746.48] The hard drive shortages were pretty drastic.
[2746.66 → 2749.34] And it made hard drives cost an insane amount of money.
[2749.34 → 2757.30] And for a long time there, people were legitimately putting off builds because they didn't want to pay the ludicrous prices for hard drives at the time.
[2758.10 → 2760.34] I don't think that's quite going to happen with RAM.
[2760.42 → 2762.14] I'm sure the price will go up.
[2762.56 → 2769.16] But I just don't think it would be as monstrously insane as the hard drive prices were when all that was going on.
[2769.16 → 2772.44] So, yeah, it is definitely a problem.
[2774.46 → 2780.78] But another thing that was pretty cool is they had a special Gemini architecture with the building.
[2780.94 → 2786.66] So basically what happened was each one of the clean rooms and everything, different facilities operated independently.
[2787.30 → 2792.52] So the ones that were damaged.
[2792.60 → 2794.96] And the ones that were completely left alone are fine.
[2794.96 → 2797.42] So not the whole plant is down.
[2797.54 → 2804.38] They need to, they're shipping in a bunch of professionals and engineers and all this other kind of stuff to investigate the plant and figure out everything that's wrong.
[2804.70 → 2810.62] And that will probably take at least the next two months, which they'll lose a huge amount of production.
[2810.80 → 2813.40] So we'll see those RAM prices probably start to increase from there.
[2814.08 → 2816.10] If I can just jump in about fire.
[2816.38 → 2816.72] Yep.
[2816.88 → 2819.50] Because I have a little bit of a connection there.
[2820.70 → 2821.70] You're sporting the shirt.
[2821.70 → 2827.70] But it's, to say that they're sending in guys to assess the damage, that always sounds kind of hokey.
[2828.06 → 2830.40] Unless you understand, like I have no idea how the plant was built.
[2830.74 → 2833.64] But just knowing how it can spread through floors, through eaves.
[2833.70 → 2835.20] Obviously there's probably not a ton of wood.
[2835.76 → 2839.66] But the fact is steel can heat to the point where it can ignite things in other rooms.
[2840.18 → 2840.86] It's been proven.
[2840.96 → 2843.90] I watched a video recently on just heating a steel rod.
[2844.10 → 2848.28] The heat went through the rod into another room and lit a couch on fire because it was touching it.
[2849.00 → 2850.70] Just because of how heat can conduct.
[2850.70 → 2855.18] But when they say they need to assess the damage after a big fire, that is a factual statement.
[2855.60 → 2858.86] It's incredibly hard to do something like that, especially on a large scale.
[2859.10 → 2863.44] And they have to do it on a completely different level almost because they have clean rooms.
[2864.06 → 2869.60] So they have to make sure there's a maximum amount of particles you can have in a room to be able to call it a clean room.
[2869.66 → 2871.22] Yeah, that's a whole other level.
[2871.32 → 2872.64] I mean particles in the air.
[2872.80 → 2872.94] Yeah.
[2873.36 → 2875.96] So like, oh, that's ridiculous.
[2876.12 → 2878.74] So there's going to be an insane amount of investigation that has to go on.
[2878.74 → 2880.72] That's why they're saying for the next like two months, probably.
[2881.16 → 2885.76] And then from there, they might get production going on in part of the plant but not the whole plant.
[2885.84 → 2891.30] But again, I don't think this is going to be on the scale of the hard drive crisis because it's still not the same amount.
[2891.54 → 2893.56] We are going to do a Twitter blitz soon.
[2893.90 → 2894.84] Not quite yet.
[2894.90 → 2897.04] We're going to do one more topic, and then we're going to do a Twitter blitz.
[2897.04 → 2899.96] So you guys can ask us about whatever you want.
[2900.12 → 2903.14] Tweet me at Slick PC, and we will hit up the Twitter blitz.
[2903.22 → 2904.76] That's going to be right after the next topic.
[2905.28 → 2907.90] And we're going to jump down to that right now.
[2908.06 → 2911.88] So DATA showed off a picture of 32 gigabytes of DDR4.
[2912.10 → 2913.14] But not really.
[2913.24 → 2915.28] There was some interesting stuff going on.
[2915.56 → 2917.58] They worded it in a very odd way.
[2917.58 → 2921.52] But what it actually was 32 gigabytes on a single stick.
[2921.60 → 2922.88] Super tall one, by the way.
[2922.94 → 2923.54] It was massive.
[2924.04 → 2927.12] Of DDR3L, which is DDR3 low voltage.
[2927.28 → 2929.56] So as you guys can see there if you go back there, the RAM stick.
[2929.94 → 2931.06] It's huge.
[2931.72 → 2932.66] The thing's giant.
[2932.76 → 2933.80] It's like a Dominator.
[2934.20 → 2935.26] Maybe even a little bit bigger.
[2935.44 → 2935.66] You know what?
[2935.68 → 2937.14] I would say it's probably even bigger.
[2937.26 → 2938.58] Probably even bigger than a Dominator.
[2939.02 → 2940.70] And like those are huge already.
[2940.94 → 2941.44] So that's pretty nice.
[2941.44 → 2942.96] The DDR3 Dominators, of course.
[2943.16 → 2943.34] Yeah.
[2943.34 → 2944.16] That's what we refer to.
[2944.26 → 2944.84] Not the DDR2.
[2944.84 → 2947.30] Not the boss mode DDR2 Dominators.
[2947.36 → 2948.22] That we both rocked.
[2948.36 → 2948.44] Yeah.
[2948.66 → 2948.82] Yeah.
[2950.58 → 2951.06] Anyway.
[2951.48 → 2955.12] So what they said was 32 gigabytes on a single module.
[2955.28 → 2956.20] And that's not all.
[2956.46 → 2960.14] We will see modules that will go up to 128 gigabytes in the near future.
[2960.52 → 2961.46] DDR4 is here.
[2962.20 → 2964.94] That sounds like they're talking about DDR4 in the photo.
[2965.06 → 2966.56] Which is why there was so much confusion.
[2966.86 → 2970.02] But what they were trying to say is, look.
[2970.36 → 2972.12] 32 gigabytes on a single module.
[2973.34 → 2978.16] Things will be getting exciting in the future with DDR4 once that becomes a thing.
[2978.84 → 2980.74] Because we can see stuff around 128 gigabytes.
[2981.04 → 2982.74] They're talking about two separate things.
[2982.82 → 2982.90] Yeah.
[2983.10 → 2985.12] They're saying, look what we can do now.
[2985.88 → 2989.98] This is what we're probably going to be able to do in the future with two separate things.
[2990.10 → 2991.00] Completely separate things.
[2994.50 → 2995.62] So, like.
[2997.40 → 2999.32] There was a lot of controversy about that.
[2999.36 → 2999.94] A lot of confusion.
[2999.94 → 3002.72] On our forum alone it got three pages worth of comments.
[3002.72 → 3005.98] And on the Facebook page it got a huge amount of comments.
[3007.04 → 3009.08] So, just wanted to point that out.
[3009.26 → 3013.66] Another cool tidbit to take away from that is 128 gigabytes of RAM on a freaking stick.
[3014.44 → 3015.58] Sorry, I've got to remember to move.
[3015.72 → 3016.72] I'm still in my nervous state.
[3016.90 → 3017.12] But yes.
[3017.54 → 3018.00] That is.
[3018.22 → 3020.40] I remember when you first showed this to me.
[3020.46 → 3021.20] We were actually talking about.
[3021.28 → 3022.52] That's incredible.
[3022.52 → 3023.46] You know.
[3023.52 → 3024.06] That is.
[3025.74 → 3027.58] That's so many times what you could ever need.
[3027.68 → 3027.82] You know.
[3027.88 → 3030.30] Unless you're running half a dozen virtual machines.
[3030.54 → 3030.66] You know.
[3030.82 → 3032.22] Or something to that aspect.
[3032.68 → 3035.50] But it's just showing you where we can go.
[3035.72 → 3036.10] And where.
[3036.52 → 3036.88] Definitely.
[3037.12 → 3037.90] Our limits aren't.
[3037.96 → 3038.70] If that makes any sense.
[3038.74 → 3038.88] Sorry.
[3039.00 → 3039.20] You know.
[3039.24 → 3040.50] Showing us where our limits are not.
[3040.66 → 3040.92] Yeah.
[3041.06 → 3041.18] Yeah.
[3041.18 → 3041.42] Exactly.
[3041.42 → 3044.76] You'll never need more than whatever that number was of RAM.
[3044.90 → 3045.30] I already don't remember.
[3045.30 → 3045.40] Exactly.
[3045.40 → 3046.74] It's like 64 kilobytes or something.
[3046.74 → 3046.90] Yeah.
[3046.98 → 3047.38] Ridiculous.
[3047.40 → 3047.92] Back in the day.
[3047.98 → 3048.08] Yeah.
[3048.12 → 3048.46] Dude.
[3048.94 → 3049.76] 128 gigs.
[3049.84 → 3050.42] On a stick.
[3050.42 → 3050.58] Yeah.
[3050.76 → 3051.34] A stick.
[3051.50 → 3051.88] And like.
[3051.96 → 3052.14] Okay.
[3052.20 → 3056.10] Maybe this isn't super consumer focused necessarily.
[3056.96 → 3057.40] But.
[3058.48 → 3059.46] It's still awesome.
[3059.58 → 3061.40] Because at some point in time we will need this.
[3061.66 → 3062.04] Exactly.
[3062.12 → 3063.44] But everything that starts elite.
[3063.56 → 3064.78] That starts business class.
[3064.96 → 3065.80] Eventually will trigger them.
[3065.80 → 3066.72] Moves into consumer.
[3066.86 → 3067.16] And like.
[3067.16 → 3067.80] It always happens.
[3067.94 → 3070.12] A lot of people are only using about 6 gigs of RAM now.
[3070.40 → 3070.60] Yeah.
[3070.60 → 3071.52] I'd say that's a.
[3071.78 → 3073.34] Like fairly heavy usage.
[3073.52 → 3074.54] 6 gigs of RAM is a thing.
[3074.94 → 3075.14] But.
[3075.40 → 3076.44] It'll always increase.
[3077.00 → 3079.22] So the fact that we will have that available is awesome.
[3079.36 → 3079.94] And stuff like.
[3080.28 → 3080.68] Haswell.
[3080.96 → 3081.44] Uh.
[3081.58 → 3081.94] IVE.
[3083.28 → 3083.44] Yeah.
[3083.48 → 3083.64] Nope.
[3083.68 → 3084.10] Haswell E.
[3084.16 → 3084.52] There we go.
[3084.70 → 3085.10] Haswell E.
[3085.16 → 3085.50] Coming out.
[3085.56 → 3086.18] Rumours and stuff.
[3086.46 → 3087.04] Eight cores.
[3087.40 → 3088.04] Eight cores.
[3088.26 → 3089.26] And eight dim slots.
[3089.32 → 3091.06] With 128 gigs in each dim slot.
[3091.94 → 3092.34] Boom.
[3092.72 → 3094.48] It's like a billion and a half gigs I think.
[3094.92 → 3097.46] It's probably somewhere around a billion and a half gigs.
[3099.06 → 3100.18] It's just ridiculous.
[3100.18 → 3100.80] So we are.
[3100.88 → 3102.36] We're basically unlocking limits.
[3102.52 → 3103.52] Which is just fantastic.
[3103.72 → 3104.42] Because right there.
[3104.60 → 3107.42] You're getting away from anything you could ever need.
[3107.56 → 3109.52] Until you get into things like Knight's Corner.
[3109.68 → 3111.20] Which I haven't heard a lot about in a long time.
[3111.28 → 3112.08] But come on Intel.
[3112.22 → 3113.24] Tell me more about Knight's Corner.
[3114.02 → 3114.34] Um.
[3114.48 → 3116.10] I'm not even going to explain that any further.
[3116.50 → 3118.50] We're going to jump into Twitter Blitz.
[3118.56 → 3120.78] Before we get into the depressing topic of the day.
[3121.16 → 3122.72] So hopefully people tweeted me.
[3123.02 → 3125.18] Or else this is going to be super anticlimactic.
[3125.74 → 3126.58] Looks like they did.
[3126.58 → 3127.76] I'm willing to bet they did.
[3128.16 → 3129.56] So if we go to Twitter Blitz.
[3131.46 → 3132.24] Do do.
[3132.92 → 3133.76] Do do do.
[3133.80 → 3137.04] Did you know that Samsung is making the iPhone A7 processor.
[3137.20 → 3139.06] Funny Samsung being one of their main competitors.
[3139.54 → 3141.00] You actually pointed this out to me.
[3141.54 → 3141.90] And.
[3142.70 → 3143.48] He asked.
[3143.70 → 3145.22] Guess who's making the A7 processor.
[3145.48 → 3146.70] And I guessed it.
[3146.70 → 3147.50] But just because.
[3147.92 → 3149.00] I thought that would be hilarious.
[3149.72 → 3151.98] Not because I necessarily even thought it would be true.
[3152.20 → 3153.04] And I was thinking like.
[3153.12 → 3153.24] Okay.
[3153.30 → 3154.06] Who could make this?
[3154.30 → 3154.90] It's not Intel.
[3155.40 → 3156.18] So who else is it?
[3156.22 → 3156.32] Right?
[3156.78 → 3157.10] Um.
[3157.44 → 3158.10] The thing is.
[3158.22 → 3159.42] And the article that I was reading.
[3159.56 → 3160.44] Stated it very well.
[3160.84 → 3161.16] Is.
[3161.28 → 3163.20] It's hard to find someone who can produce.
[3163.36 → 3163.60] Yeah.
[3163.94 → 3165.10] That kind of technology.
[3165.30 → 3166.26] On that kind of scale.
[3166.36 → 3167.24] It's not like you can be like.
[3167.28 → 3167.94] Well I don't like you.
[3168.24 → 3169.38] I'm going to go down to Bob's.
[3170.06 → 3170.42] Hardware.
[3170.66 → 3171.12] And you know.
[3171.16 → 3172.02] Get Bob to do it.
[3172.08 → 3173.10] Just buy a few chips.
[3173.22 → 3173.86] No big deal.
[3173.98 → 3175.30] I haven't talked to Bob since like.
[3175.46 → 3176.58] The 2011 Christmas party.
[3176.68 → 3177.40] But I'm sure we can.
[3177.76 → 3178.00] You know.
[3178.00 → 3178.84] Bro fist it up.
[3179.02 → 3179.60] And he'll make me.
[3179.66 → 3180.44] It doesn't work like that.
[3180.46 → 3181.30] He's one of those people.
[3181.48 → 3181.80] Where you can.
[3181.94 → 3183.82] Even if you haven't met each other for a long time.
[3183.92 → 3184.94] It's still instant click again.
[3185.22 → 3186.02] Nothing's ever changed.
[3186.10 → 3186.66] There's no drama.
[3187.34 → 3188.56] Been the same since grade 12.
[3188.74 → 3189.10] Exactly.
[3189.20 → 3189.70] No big deal.
[3190.02 → 3190.38] Anyway.
[3190.82 → 3192.16] That made no sense at all.
[3192.58 → 3192.90] But.
[3193.32 → 3193.70] Yeah.
[3194.12 → 3194.42] So.
[3194.72 → 3195.58] It does though.
[3195.66 → 3197.00] With the core point being.
[3197.16 → 3198.38] That you don't have options.
[3198.90 → 3199.04] Yeah.
[3199.04 → 3201.28] And even if you guys are suing each other.
[3201.40 → 3201.62] You know.
[3201.66 → 3202.86] A dozen lawsuits at a time.
[3203.38 → 3204.62] They still work together.
[3204.74 → 3205.16] Which is.
[3205.52 → 3207.12] And both companies must have looked.
[3207.12 → 3208.84] The Samsung looks at this and goes.
[3209.00 → 3211.16] Here's a huge part of profit that we can make.
[3211.26 → 3211.38] Yeah.
[3211.70 → 3212.54] We made this processor.
[3212.80 → 3213.80] We can give it to them.
[3214.22 → 3216.62] Their market share is not going to go down if we don't do this.
[3216.96 → 3217.32] Exactly.
[3217.44 → 3218.00] Because they.
[3218.00 → 3219.26] Even though there aren't a lot of options.
[3219.34 → 3219.90] They'll find something.
[3220.26 → 3220.54] Yeah.
[3220.76 → 3221.48] Out of necessity.
[3221.78 → 3222.06] They would.
[3222.26 → 3222.44] Yeah.
[3222.72 → 3223.02] So.
[3223.38 → 3224.10] Make a ton of money.
[3224.30 → 3224.58] Or.
[3224.80 → 3225.60] Don't make a ton of money.
[3225.82 → 3226.86] And there's no really.
[3227.30 → 3228.56] Not much else going on there.
[3228.62 → 3228.74] Like.
[3228.78 → 3230.24] They might have lost a little bit more market share.
[3230.50 → 3231.86] But it wouldn't have been that significant.
[3232.18 → 3233.88] Compared to them being able to sell the chip to them.
[3233.88 → 3234.38] And even.
[3234.56 → 3237.36] They might lose a minute amount of share.
[3237.80 → 3238.84] But they're just gaining cash.
[3238.88 → 3240.02] They don't have to market these chips.
[3240.14 → 3240.52] Not at all.
[3240.52 → 3242.26] All they're doing is just mass-producing.
[3242.56 → 3243.42] Mass shipping them.
[3243.84 → 3244.74] They set their price.
[3244.82 → 3245.20] Obviously.
[3245.34 → 3246.44] I don't know the exact numbers.
[3246.56 → 3246.72] Yeah.
[3246.72 → 3248.08] But something like that.
[3248.18 → 3250.28] Doesn't take nearly the same risks.
[3250.70 → 3251.06] Risks.
[3251.20 → 3252.28] As something you're going to produce.
[3252.44 → 3253.32] And then try and sell.
[3253.62 → 3253.72] Yeah.
[3253.72 → 3253.84] You know.
[3253.84 → 3254.42] Take the S3.
[3254.52 → 3254.86] The S4.
[3254.92 → 3255.94] Even though those sell incredibly.
[3256.28 → 3256.78] The Note 3.
[3256.88 → 3257.90] That's going to sell very well too.
[3257.90 → 3258.04] Oh.
[3258.14 → 3258.34] Of course.
[3258.50 → 3260.16] It's not a technical guarantee.
[3260.58 → 3261.38] Where if I go.
[3261.80 → 3262.26] Hey Luke.
[3262.34 → 3263.12] I'm going to go to you.
[3263.22 → 3263.64] I need.
[3264.12 → 3264.92] A million of these.
[3265.04 → 3265.20] You know.
[3265.24 → 3265.86] Probably more.
[3265.94 → 3266.32] But let's say.
[3266.40 → 3266.52] You know.
[3266.56 → 3267.72] I need a million of these chips.
[3267.84 → 3267.98] Sure.
[3268.18 → 3269.26] And you come back with a price.
[3269.42 → 3269.60] You know.
[3269.68 → 3270.02] That's.
[3270.02 → 3271.56] That's such a linear trade.
[3271.70 → 3271.86] Yeah.
[3272.02 → 3272.80] That it is.
[3272.80 → 3274.10] It's such a business smart.
[3274.18 → 3274.90] And easy decision.
[3275.26 → 3275.86] That you know.
[3275.86 → 3276.38] They could never.
[3276.48 → 3277.58] They could never pass something like that up.
[3277.62 → 3277.76] Yeah.
[3277.82 → 3279.12] So it's smart on both sides.
[3279.26 → 3280.36] Apple got a great chip.
[3280.58 → 3281.90] The A7 is a great chip.
[3282.58 → 3284.06] And Samsung made a bunch of money.
[3284.06 → 3284.56] So like.
[3284.68 → 3285.74] It makes sense.
[3285.84 → 3286.22] And while.
[3286.58 → 3288.00] These companies are huge.
[3288.08 → 3289.18] That's another thing you have to realize.
[3289.60 → 3292.28] So while part of them might be competing with another company.
[3292.42 → 3295.94] It's not necessary that the whole company is competing at the same time.
[3296.60 → 3297.14] So like.
[3297.24 → 3298.56] Their division that's making processors.
[3299.26 → 3300.68] Isn't necessarily competing with Apple.
[3301.36 → 3301.90] That makes not sense.
[3301.90 → 3302.52] The mobile division is.
[3302.80 → 3303.20] Yeah.
[3303.22 → 3306.06] So the mobile division might be more reluctant to share things.
[3306.66 → 3306.98] But.
[3307.40 → 3308.52] The other part might not be.
[3308.64 → 3309.00] So it's.
[3309.06 → 3309.46] It's just.
[3309.88 → 3310.88] It's just kind of interesting.
[3311.20 → 3311.58] That's.
[3311.66 → 3312.28] That's a good point.
[3313.30 → 3314.00] Do do do.
[3314.88 → 3316.36] Who's your favourite Data hero?
[3316.62 → 3317.64] I'm going to scroll down to this one.
[3317.70 → 3318.52] This is kind of random.
[3318.64 → 3319.70] But who's your favourite Data hero?
[3319.92 → 3320.60] I think I know.
[3321.84 → 3322.00] The.
[3322.00 → 3322.22] The.
[3322.22 → 3322.24] The.
[3322.24 → 3322.44] The.
[3322.44 → 3323.56] I've only played a couple of games.
[3323.68 → 3323.92] Yeah.
[3323.92 → 3325.02] I've only really played the sniper.
[3325.18 → 3325.42] Yeah.
[3325.64 → 3325.82] Yeah.
[3325.82 → 3326.50] He's pretty cool.
[3326.50 → 3327.52] I like Dwarves Sniper too.
[3327.62 → 3327.88] But my.
[3328.00 → 3329.06] I'm going to go with Draw Ranger.
[3329.42 → 3330.68] That was a little bit more random.
[3331.32 → 3332.02] Clark Martin.
[3332.02 → 3332.92] It's his birthday.
[3333.14 → 3334.28] So shout out to you man.
[3334.36 → 3335.12] Happy birthday dude.
[3335.26 → 3335.88] Happy birthday.
[3337.42 → 3338.50] I like his picture.
[3339.22 → 3339.58] Me too.
[3339.70 → 3340.40] It's pretty awesome.
[3344.00 → 3347.28] Large capacity RAM versus low cast latency RAM for gaming.
[3347.46 → 3349.82] I'm actually going to be releasing a video very soon.
[3349.82 → 3351.62] Where I'm benchmarking.
[3353.06 → 3354.70] Cast latency and timing.
[3355.30 → 3356.54] Differences on RAM.
[3356.94 → 3358.52] Now they're all 8 gig modules.
[3358.88 → 3360.14] It's actually the same kit.
[3360.22 → 3361.98] I'm just changing latencies and timing.
[3362.46 → 3371.30] And then we're going to show that performance compared to cost of a stick of RAM that has
[3371.30 → 3371.92] those specs.
[3372.50 → 3377.66] So I took a really, really high-end stick of RAM and I turned the settings way down and
[3377.66 → 3379.36] then incrementally turned the settings up.
[3379.94 → 3384.80] And then we're going to show cost per performance for that kind of RAM.
[3385.14 → 3386.48] And it's an interesting story.
[3386.60 → 3387.96] I can already tell you what it's going to be.
[3387.96 → 3392.54] It's not really worth buying super high performance RAM because you do gain performance, but it's
[3392.54 → 3394.90] a very low amount of performance that you're gaining.
[3395.34 → 3395.54] So.
[3395.78 → 3398.24] Is it noticeable is the question we got to start asking ourselves.
[3398.44 → 3398.66] You know.
[3398.86 → 3399.08] Yeah.
[3399.08 → 3402.14] Not really.
[3402.52 → 3402.70] Yeah.
[3402.86 → 3406.66] The moral of the story is probably bought a 1600 kit.
[3407.22 → 3407.54] And then.
[3408.50 → 3409.04] There you go.
[3409.44 → 3410.76] Because that's kind of the sweet spot.
[3410.90 → 3411.14] Although.
[3411.52 → 3412.04] You'll be able to.
[3412.30 → 3415.32] You'll be able to decide your own sweet spot.
[3415.74 → 3416.32] Once we're there.
[3416.40 → 3417.68] I just scrolled way right up.
[3417.90 → 3417.92] And it's really.
[3417.92 → 3418.18] You know.
[3418.38 → 3420.38] Linus and yourself are a huge hardware buff.
[3420.42 → 3420.74] I'm not.
[3421.22 → 3421.62] I love.
[3421.72 → 3422.52] I love computer hardware.
[3422.60 → 3424.64] But I'm not on the same level as you guys as hardware buffs.
[3425.00 → 3425.78] I'm a little bit more.
[3426.20 → 3427.28] I guess blue collar I guess.
[3427.36 → 3428.90] Which I'm sure some of your viewers are as well.
[3429.22 → 3429.66] And for me.
[3429.74 → 3432.70] Something like a 1600 for RAM is perfect.
[3432.80 → 3434.66] Because the bang for your buck is just.
[3434.78 → 3435.38] It's there.
[3435.66 → 3436.94] You can get it for a great price.
[3437.20 → 3438.90] It works great for whatever you're doing.
[3439.56 → 3440.02] You know.
[3440.02 → 3440.64] As long as you get.
[3441.02 → 3441.28] You know.
[3441.36 → 3442.20] Like get an 8 gig pack.
[3442.20 → 3443.12] I happen to have 16.
[3443.76 → 3444.44] That's overkill.
[3444.58 → 3445.32] To be completely honest.
[3445.38 → 3445.60] It is.
[3445.64 → 3446.58] For what I use it for.
[3446.74 → 3447.58] It is.
[3447.78 → 3448.54] Is it nice?
[3448.62 → 3449.24] Does it look good?
[3449.28 → 3449.64] Hell yeah.
[3449.64 → 3452.62] But is it technically over and above what I need?
[3452.70 → 3452.96] Yes.
[3453.10 → 3454.44] And I just think RAM.
[3454.54 → 3455.96] Especially with something like RAM.
[3456.64 → 3457.08] You know.
[3457.10 → 3458.60] That's where you can save a little bit of money.
[3459.18 → 3459.38] You know.
[3459.40 → 3459.62] And get.
[3459.72 → 3459.90] You know.
[3459.94 → 3460.76] Get an 8 gig kit.
[3461.28 → 3461.40] And.
[3461.48 → 3461.62] Yeah.
[3462.42 → 3463.04] And you can be set.
[3463.12 → 3463.34] Of course.
[3463.36 → 3464.16] If you want to do more than that.
[3464.96 → 3465.64] It's possible.
[3465.64 → 3466.04] And then.
[3466.14 → 3466.50] Even then.
[3466.66 → 3467.20] You can buy.
[3468.00 → 3468.04] Like.
[3468.16 → 3468.32] Like.
[3468.64 → 3468.96] Dominators.
[3469.50 → 3470.00] Low end.
[3470.30 → 3470.66] Dominators.
[3470.86 → 3471.58] Dominator Platinums.
[3471.70 → 3472.14] Are not.
[3472.98 → 3473.90] That expensive.
[3474.46 → 3474.60] Like.
[3474.66 → 3475.62] They're not that bad.
[3475.72 → 3476.36] And they look amazing.
[3476.36 → 3477.00] As long as you go alone.
[3477.32 → 3478.48] And they look freaking incredible.
[3478.78 → 3479.62] You can instantly make.
[3479.62 → 3481.32] Your build look so much better.
[3481.86 → 3482.10] Yeah.
[3482.20 → 3483.08] By throwing in some Dominators.
[3483.22 → 3484.32] Or throwing in some other.
[3484.90 → 3485.34] RAM.
[3485.50 → 3486.26] That looks sharp.
[3486.38 → 3486.86] Like I know.
[3487.70 → 3488.64] Corsair LPs.
[3489.34 → 3489.52] Yeah.
[3489.58 → 3490.04] Look great.
[3490.10 → 3491.18] Because they're low to profile RAM.
[3491.24 → 3492.16] With a solid colour.
[3492.46 → 3493.14] So they can just.
[3493.28 → 3494.50] Very easily go along.
[3494.56 → 3495.88] With any colour build you want to do.
[3495.94 → 3496.66] Which is awesome.
[3496.92 → 3497.44] I think we're going to get.
[3497.52 → 3498.20] Some builds later.
[3499.02 → 3499.26] Sorry.
[3499.26 → 3499.66] Off the forums.
[3499.80 → 3499.96] Yeah.
[3499.96 → 3500.66] Some builds off the forums.
[3500.66 → 3500.94] Maybe.
[3502.60 → 3503.00] Maybe not.
[3503.12 → 3504.04] I forgot to make that PowerPoint.
[3504.72 → 3504.94] But.
[3505.26 → 3505.44] We can.
[3505.44 → 3505.98] We can.
[3506.20 → 3506.84] We can just go look.
[3506.84 → 3506.98] Yeah.
[3507.04 → 3507.82] We can just go look on the.
[3507.86 → 3508.90] That's what I do from time to time.
[3509.02 → 3509.22] Yeah.
[3509.60 → 3509.98] I actually.
[3510.08 → 3511.28] I don't post that much on the forums.
[3511.36 → 3512.78] But I do tend to look at build logs.
[3512.92 → 3513.58] Build logs is like.
[3513.58 → 3514.02] I find.
[3514.12 → 3516.04] I find that's where I spend the most of my time.
[3516.20 → 3517.40] I can do that on my phone at work.
[3517.70 → 3517.82] Yeah.
[3517.82 → 3517.90] So.
[3518.22 → 3518.98] You can just look through and like.
[3519.04 → 3519.38] Oh pretty.
[3519.62 → 3520.08] Oh pretty.
[3520.08 → 3520.48] That's really nice.
[3520.48 → 3521.14] Oh that's nice.
[3521.22 → 3522.22] I like what you do there.
[3522.58 → 3523.46] That's pretty good.
[3523.96 → 3524.24] Yeah.
[3524.50 → 3524.76] So.
[3525.00 → 3525.34] I don't know.
[3525.46 → 3526.10] That's pretty cool.
[3526.76 → 3528.58] Will there be an app coming out for the forum?
[3528.66 → 3529.92] I know I've been sitting on this one for a while.
[3530.74 → 3531.50] Probably not.
[3532.90 → 3533.06] What.
[3533.06 → 3533.24] What.
[3533.64 → 3533.76] What.
[3533.76 → 3534.94] You have a mobile version correct?
[3534.98 → 3535.68] We have a mobile version.
[3536.08 → 3536.66] And it's pretty good.
[3536.74 → 3537.22] And an app.
[3538.58 → 3540.08] There's not no merit in that.
[3540.16 → 3541.08] An app would be better.
[3541.18 → 3543.28] Because an app you could have preloaded assets.
[3543.74 → 3544.58] So like our logo.
[3544.58 → 3546.38] And all that kind of stuff could be preloaded.
[3546.44 → 3547.60] So it could load things faster.
[3547.60 → 3550.02] And it could use less bandwidth.
[3550.62 → 3551.38] Which is another thing.
[3551.48 → 3553.34] So like there is definitely merit in that question.
[3553.60 → 3553.76] That's true.
[3554.94 → 3556.42] It's a lot of work.
[3557.76 → 3558.98] It's a huge amount of work.
[3559.18 → 3559.46] So we are.
[3560.16 → 3560.56] Yes.
[3560.86 → 3561.30] Tapetal.
[3561.44 → 3563.30] We do have Tapetal enabled on the forum.
[3563.48 → 3565.90] Which is kind of an app for the thing.
[3566.46 → 3567.58] Not really.
[3567.76 → 3569.32] But it's pretty good.
[3569.50 → 3570.60] So you can try that out.
[3570.86 → 3573.02] I would check out Tapetal if you really want an app.
[3574.14 → 3574.78] But yeah.
[3575.02 → 3575.98] If it comes.
[3576.32 → 3577.28] It won't be for.
[3577.60 → 3579.26] Like at least a year or two.
[3579.64 → 3580.42] And then even.
[3580.58 → 3581.18] Probably not.
[3581.34 → 3582.02] Because we have.
[3582.40 → 3584.06] So many other big things we want to focus on.
[3584.44 → 3585.60] Earlier in this cast.
[3585.70 → 3586.36] We talked about.
[3586.60 → 3588.06] How we're doing HTTPS.
[3588.22 → 3588.86] IP Nexus.
[3589.22 → 3589.58] Classified.
[3589.72 → 3590.44] The new theme.
[3590.90 → 3591.26] Content.
[3591.52 → 3592.54] Which is going to be the new homepage.
[3592.66 → 3593.24] Like all that kind of stuff.
[3593.52 → 3595.54] We have huge projects that we're working on the forum.
[3596.02 → 3597.40] Literally every single day.
[3597.66 → 3598.56] That we want to get done.
[3598.86 → 3599.98] All of these ideas.
[3600.14 → 3601.10] And all of these projects.
[3601.10 → 3603.42] Including other ones that we haven't talked about at all.
[3603.80 → 3605.72] Before we would even start thinking.
[3605.72 → 3606.78] About a mobile app.
[3607.28 → 3607.48] So.
[3609.80 → 3610.54] I don't know.
[3611.18 → 3612.42] That's all I have to say about that.
[3612.84 → 3614.16] I have to agree with all of that.
[3614.48 → 3614.84] I just.
[3615.20 → 3616.52] That's kind of a boring answer.
[3616.68 → 3616.80] Oh yeah.
[3616.80 → 3617.52] But it's.
[3617.80 → 3619.40] You guys are constantly progressing.
[3619.66 → 3620.06] Constantly.
[3620.06 → 3622.20] Looking at what everyone is asking of you.
[3622.42 → 3623.78] And trying to go down that path.
[3623.90 → 3624.02] So.
[3624.38 → 3624.74] It's.
[3624.74 → 3625.72] It's constantly evolving.
[3625.98 → 3626.78] And it's great to see.
[3626.84 → 3629.20] Anyone who's used the forum since the very beginning.
[3629.30 → 3629.98] Realizes this.
[3630.18 → 3630.32] Yeah.
[3630.58 → 3631.36] That it's been a.
[3631.36 → 3631.66] That's.
[3631.74 → 3632.96] It's been a constant growth.
[3633.40 → 3633.70] From day one.
[3633.70 → 3633.96] Someone.
[3634.16 → 3635.38] I was streaming the other day.
[3635.46 → 3637.18] And Wind speed was watching my stream.
[3637.28 → 3638.42] Wind speed's one of my forum mods.
[3638.52 → 3638.62] Yeah.
[3638.62 → 3640.14] And someone was like.
[3640.38 → 3640.70] Hey.
[3640.76 → 3642.36] It would be really cool if we could have.
[3642.60 → 3643.00] Like.
[3643.40 → 3645.12] Fire tags on the forum.
[3645.88 → 3646.08] Yeah.
[3646.50 → 3646.94] And I was like.
[3646.96 → 3647.08] Yeah.
[3647.10 → 3647.58] That would be pretty cool.
[3647.64 → 3648.64] I think I've seen a hook about that.
[3648.68 → 3648.96] And I was like.
[3648.96 → 3649.82] Talking for it a little bit.
[3649.82 → 3650.60] And Wind speed was just like.
[3650.66 → 3650.92] It's done.
[3652.30 → 3652.72] It's like.
[3653.74 → 3654.02] Boom.
[3654.02 → 3654.54] Wind speed?
[3654.90 → 3655.18] Yeah.
[3655.38 → 3656.12] That was pretty fast.
[3656.22 → 3657.24] You have some boss.
[3658.18 → 3658.88] Foreign mods.
[3658.98 → 3659.46] That's for sure.
[3659.72 → 3660.26] It's kind of.
[3660.40 → 3661.28] I got pretty lucky.
[3661.50 → 3662.00] To be honest.
[3662.08 → 3662.68] They're pretty epic.
[3663.24 → 3663.54] Um.
[3663.54 → 3664.74] I'm really really really picky.
[3664.98 → 3665.90] About my foreign mods.
[3666.24 → 3666.76] But like.
[3666.86 → 3667.78] That just shows.
[3667.78 → 3669.08] The agility that we've had.
[3669.16 → 3669.62] With the forum.
[3669.80 → 3670.28] We've moved.
[3670.40 → 3671.68] As quickly as we possibly can.
[3671.72 → 3672.48] At all points in time.
[3673.08 → 3673.48] Um.
[3673.56 → 3673.72] We.
[3673.84 → 3674.06] We.
[3674.18 → 3674.36] We.
[3674.76 → 3675.16] Had.
[3675.58 → 3676.12] PHP BB.
[3676.36 → 3677.46] And then we had to install VS.
[3677.90 → 3678.42] And then we were like.
[3678.48 → 3678.64] Nope.
[3678.68 → 3679.08] This sucks.
[3679.14 → 3679.98] And then we installed IPS.
[3680.36 → 3680.50] Yeah.
[3680.54 → 3681.86] And then IPS came in.
[3681.88 → 3682.44] And then we were like.
[3682.50 → 3682.64] Hook.
[3682.68 → 3682.82] Hook.
[3682.82 → 3682.96] Hook.
[3682.96 → 3683.22] Hook.
[3683.22 → 3683.36] Hook.
[3683.36 → 3683.52] Hook.
[3683.52 → 3683.58] Hook.
[3683.58 → 3683.60] Hook.
[3683.60 → 3684.32] Different add-on.
[3684.40 → 3684.54] Okay.
[3684.56 → 3685.42] People want classifieds.
[3685.42 → 3685.60] Okay.
[3685.60 → 3686.20] Work on this.
[3686.54 → 3686.72] Uh.
[3686.72 → 3687.80] Classifieds isn't really secure.
[3687.90 → 3688.72] Logins aren't really secure.
[3688.82 → 3689.16] Fix that.
[3689.28 → 3689.32] Blah.
[3689.32 → 3689.40] Blah.
[3689.40 → 3689.52] Blah.
[3697.78 → 3699.12] This room is gorgeous.
[3699.36 → 3699.52] You know.
[3699.56 → 3701.58] Everything is constantly getting better.
[3701.66 → 3702.58] Week by week.
[3702.96 → 3703.30] And uh.
[3704.56 → 3704.80] Yeah.
[3704.88 → 3705.12] Perhaps.
[3705.24 → 3706.38] Perhaps enough patting on the back.
[3706.44 → 3707.08] Maybe back to Twitter.
[3707.52 → 3707.80] Sure.
[3707.94 → 3708.12] Yeah.
[3708.22 → 3708.46] Yeah.
[3708.46 → 3708.66] Yeah.
[3708.74 → 3708.96] Okay.
[3709.10 → 3709.68] Back to Twitter.
[3710.32 → 3710.66] Um.
[3710.78 → 3711.36] Sam DB.
[3711.68 → 3713.74] He's asking if he can get a birthday shout out.
[3713.84 → 3715.48] I thought your birthday already came and went.
[3715.72 → 3715.96] But.
[3716.08 → 3716.64] Either way.
[3716.84 → 3717.74] Happy birthday.
[3717.88 → 3718.10] Sorry.
[3718.18 → 3718.62] Which one is that?
[3718.70 → 3718.82] I missed that.
[3718.82 → 3719.36] Sam DB.
[3719.86 → 3720.70] Also on his just Sam.
[3721.08 → 3721.30] Oh.
[3721.38 → 3721.74] There he is.
[3721.78 → 3721.96] Okay.
[3721.96 → 3722.14] Yeah.
[3722.14 → 3722.66] Right at the top.
[3722.68 → 3722.80] Yeah.
[3722.84 → 3723.36] With the awesome.
[3723.52 → 3724.54] With the awesome picture there.
[3724.64 → 3724.88] Yeah.
[3725.92 → 3726.32] Um.
[3726.46 → 3727.20] Streams low volume.
[3727.20 → 3727.92] Sorry bro.
[3728.90 → 3730.70] Play Star Craft against each other in the after party.
[3730.76 → 3732.52] I'm not quite sure how we could stream that.
[3733.32 → 3733.82] I think we could.
[3733.82 → 3735.28] I'm not sure how entertaining that would actually be.
[3735.28 → 3735.46] You would crush me.
[3735.52 → 3736.22] We would both be.
[3736.64 → 3739.06] Well we would both be just focused on what's going on and.
[3739.44 → 3739.66] Yeah.
[3740.06 → 3740.54] Well I'd still talk about it.
[3740.54 → 3741.78] Maybe we could set that up for some time.
[3741.96 → 3742.16] Sure.
[3742.56 → 3744.30] Maybe we can set up like viewers verse, and I'll cast it or something.
[3744.30 → 3745.66] Maybe we should do viewers verse.
[3745.96 → 3746.26] Something.
[3746.54 → 3747.16] We'll figure something out.
[3747.16 → 3750.08] We could even have viewers verse with like you and me versus viewers or something.
[3750.08 → 3750.30] Something.
[3750.58 → 3752.70] But I don't think it would be that entertaining for us to.
[3752.80 → 3754.32] Because he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
[3754.42 → 3755.58] And not even because of that.
[3755.58 → 3756.90] He's just way better than me in general.
[3757.20 → 3757.38] So.
[3757.70 → 3760.62] Those two combinations where I'm not going to change my strategy.
[3761.18 → 3762.26] Because I only do one thing.
[3762.68 → 3764.28] And that he's way better than me in general.
[3764.66 → 3766.54] Is a bad combination meaning I lose.
[3767.16 → 3767.48] So.
[3767.72 → 3769.02] It might not be too eventful.
[3769.08 → 3769.98] You know maybe some Hearthstone.
[3770.08 → 3770.90] That's cool right now.
[3771.32 → 3772.10] We could do Hearthstone.
[3772.10 → 3772.48] Or maybe some Counter-Strike.
[3772.48 → 3772.92] Yeah.
[3773.14 → 3773.62] There's like.
[3773.72 → 3774.34] There's a ton.
[3774.40 → 3775.94] There's a ton of stuff we can do on the after party.
[3776.26 → 3777.40] There is going to be an after party.
[3777.48 → 3781.28] The after party will be twitched.tv slash Luke underscore LAIR.
[3781.62 → 3783.20] We have to go to your place.
[3783.68 → 3783.88] Yeah.
[3784.10 → 3784.50] It shouldn't.
[3784.78 → 3785.54] It shouldn't take that long.
[3785.64 → 3785.78] Yeah.
[3785.86 → 3786.10] We'll be up pretty quick.
[3786.10 → 3786.76] We're pretty close.
[3786.90 → 3787.60] We'll be up pretty quick.
[3788.06 → 3790.10] Did you check out the Star Citizen hangar module?
[3790.60 → 3791.00] Guys.
[3793.08 → 3794.08] If you have.
[3794.28 → 3796.22] If you backed Star Citizen.
[3796.94 → 3797.94] Get on that.
[3798.06 → 3798.66] Go to the website.
[3798.86 → 3799.84] Download the hangar module.
[3800.08 → 3801.14] Holy crap.
[3801.22 → 3802.18] It's freaking cool.
[3802.48 → 3805.08] You can check out the ship that you have because you backed.
[3805.16 → 3806.28] Hopefully you have a ship because you backed.
[3806.74 → 3808.40] And it's really nice.
[3808.52 → 3811.10] They don't have a ton of graphics settings, yet that are available.
[3811.24 → 3811.82] They don't have AA.
[3812.30 → 3814.04] They don't have like a bunch of other stuff.
[3814.26 → 3815.86] But like check it out.
[3815.90 → 3816.66] It's fantastic.
[3816.88 → 3817.08] We are.
[3817.28 → 3818.02] We are.
[3818.02 → 3819.90] This is largely going to be driven by me.
[3820.02 → 3821.68] But Linus is also a huge fan of Star Citizen.
[3821.84 → 3824.94] So he's not against this idea when I proposed it at all.
[3825.30 → 3829.14] But what I want to do is have benchmark runs for every iteration of Star Citizen.
[3829.14 → 3832.34] So soon I'm like halfway done running it, actually.
[3833.88 → 3836.68] And because Linus is away I might actually just film the whole thing myself.
[3837.16 → 3838.06] But we are.
[3838.52 → 3842.10] I'm going to have benchmark stuff for the hangar module.
[3842.34 → 3845.80] And then when dogfighting comes out I'm going to have a benchmarking video for dogfighting.
[3845.86 → 3848.74] And then whenever the heck comes out after that I'm going to have a benchmarking video for that.
[3848.74 → 3851.86] And I'm going to try and have benchmarking videos along the way.
[3852.52 → 3858.22] Which they may not be super accurate with how hard it's going to be to run the game when it's out.
[3858.40 → 3859.94] But the game's not out for a really long time.
[3860.30 → 3863.44] And we think it would be interesting to show the progression of the game.
[3863.88 → 3864.54] That too.
[3864.60 → 3866.22] It's kind of an iconic game right now.
[3866.30 → 3866.40] Yeah.
[3867.48 → 3871.84] So it might not have 100% of the value as maybe another benchmarking game.
[3872.08 → 3872.20] Yeah.
[3872.20 → 3874.34] But it also has the value that everyone is watching this.
[3874.66 → 3875.36] Everyone's following it.
[3875.40 → 3877.34] How many Star Citizen shirts did we see in PAX?
[3877.34 → 3877.64] Oh my god.
[3877.68 → 3878.60] Not including your own.
[3878.70 → 3878.90] Yeah.
[3880.26 → 3881.24] It's just iconic.
[3881.60 → 3883.80] You know that's the best way to summarize everything I want to say.
[3883.86 → 3884.08] Yeah.
[3884.16 → 3886.56] Is that you know a lot of eyes are on this project.
[3886.72 → 3887.04] For sure.
[3887.04 → 3889.04] And like with the amount of people that are backing it.
[3889.30 → 3892.54] It's going to define a part in gaming history.
[3893.20 → 3893.28] Yeah.
[3893.32 → 3895.32] Like just with the amount of money that's been spent on it.
[3895.44 → 3897.10] With the scope of this project.
[3897.38 → 3899.46] And the amount of people that are into this game.
[3899.90 → 3901.54] Like it doesn't matter if you ignore it.
[3901.54 → 3902.70] It's going to be huge.
[3902.86 → 3903.02] Yeah.
[3903.12 → 3905.80] So we might as well try and track it as best as we can.
[3906.04 → 3906.82] That being said.
[3906.88 → 3908.32] It's not like we're not going to have.
[3908.40 → 3910.30] I'm going to have a benchmarking video for Battlefield 4.
[3910.44 → 3911.46] I can give you that right now.
[3912.26 → 3915.20] I'm probably going to have a benchmarking video for GTA V.
[3915.20 → 3916.88] Whenever the heck it finally comes out for PC.
[3917.06 → 3917.78] Make it fast.
[3919.24 → 3922.78] And like I'm going to keep on covering all this stuff.
[3922.98 → 3926.08] Just I also want to have all the iterations of Star Citizen along the way.
[3927.24 → 3928.94] We're not really blitzing this Twitter.
[3929.06 → 3930.22] We're spending a little bit of time on it.
[3930.32 → 3930.86] But oh well.
[3930.86 → 3933.36] This is a siege.
[3933.46 → 3934.06] A Twitter siege.
[3934.18 → 3934.34] Twitter.
[3934.72 → 3934.88] Yeah.
[3934.96 → 3935.32] Twitter siege.
[3935.54 → 3936.76] We will break down the walls.
[3937.12 → 3938.24] But it might take a little while.
[3938.98 → 3940.54] I've used Windows all my life.
[3940.70 → 3941.68] I've dabbled on Ubuntu.
[3941.92 → 3943.60] But I couldn't get past installing drivers.
[3943.80 → 3944.96] What's a good way to learn Linux?
[3945.92 → 3948.18] There are tons of different videos online.
[3948.92 → 3951.38] I'm surprised you had problems with drivers, actually.
[3951.52 → 3953.60] Because a lot of them just use general Linux drivers.
[3954.08 → 3956.40] So with Ubuntu as long as you can get an internet connection.
[3956.40 → 3958.68] It shouldn't be that hard really.
[3959.96 → 3960.86] Now that being said.
[3960.94 → 3962.26] Of course there are problems.
[3962.42 → 3964.06] So if you have problems with a core driver.
[3964.36 → 3965.40] That's really unfortunate.
[3966.10 → 3966.90] But I would just.
[3967.02 → 3970.40] I can't think of any websites off the top of my head.
[3970.48 → 3971.64] But there are tons of them.
[3971.90 → 3973.06] I just can't think of them right now.
[3973.10 → 3974.18] I have them bookmarked.
[3975.42 → 3976.96] That can help you with this kind of stuff.
[3977.14 → 3978.26] But one of the first things.
[3978.38 → 3979.32] Install your drivers.
[3979.60 → 3980.50] Make sure everything works.
[3980.68 → 3981.98] And then try and go in.
[3982.30 → 3984.50] And install all the programs that you want.
[3984.72 → 3986.50] Try to do it manually through command line.
[3986.58 → 3987.64] That will teach you very quickly.
[3988.08 → 3990.56] And start trying to navigate through folders and everything.
[3990.70 → 3991.54] Through command line.
[3991.68 → 3993.64] Because that will teach you a lot very quickly.
[3994.28 → 3995.94] Or if you just want to be a casual user.
[3996.12 → 3997.24] Once you get those drivers installed.
[3997.34 → 3998.58] There's not much left to do.
[3998.58 → 4000.32] They have their own little version of an app store.
[4000.42 → 4001.06] And all that kind of stuff.
[4001.22 → 4001.88] So yeah.
[4001.90 → 4003.40] I've never had driver issues with Ubuntu either.
[4003.62 → 4006.48] I've actually never had a single driver.
[4006.60 → 4009.02] Not automatically detect and install itself.
[4009.70 → 4012.96] But there's obviously potential for problems.
[4013.12 → 4014.60] So that's quite unfortunate.
[4017.06 → 4018.38] What do I think of the Shine 3?
[4018.56 → 4019.42] Shine 3 is pretty epic.
[4019.78 → 4021.34] Fade Reactive is like.
[4021.56 → 4021.96] Yeah.
[4022.12 → 4023.00] The coolest thing ever.
[4023.26 → 4023.28] Yeah.
[4023.28 → 4023.70] For sure.
[4023.82 → 4025.16] So what Fade Reactive is.
[4025.22 → 4026.72] Is reactive mode on a keyboard.
[4026.72 → 4029.38] Is when you're typing, and it lights up when you press down.
[4029.66 → 4030.40] The problem with that is.
[4030.46 → 4031.24] The second you let go.
[4031.32 → 4031.92] The light goes away.
[4032.02 → 4033.54] So it doesn't really do much.
[4033.74 → 4034.50] It's just too quick.
[4034.84 → 4035.00] Yeah.
[4035.08 → 4035.56] It's too quick.
[4035.86 → 4037.14] So Fade Reactive is.
[4037.22 → 4038.28] It puts a fade on the light.
[4038.40 → 4039.34] So it turns the light on.
[4039.42 → 4040.42] And then it fades away.
[4040.50 → 4041.30] Instead of just turning off.
[4041.32 → 4041.92] Super cool.
[4042.06 → 4044.64] So it gives this really cool effect.
[4044.70 → 4045.92] Especially if you type really quickly.
[4046.30 → 4047.12] So that's awesome.
[4047.24 → 4047.90] And like realistically.
[4047.90 → 4049.54] Once you get past a certain point.
[4049.78 → 4051.32] You're looking at build quality and features.
[4051.32 → 4055.06] So while that might not seem like a huge deal to some people.
[4055.28 → 4057.90] That's what you're looking at when you're purchasing a ducky or a Philo.
[4058.36 → 4058.98] You're looking at features.
[4058.98 → 4059.56] Or something like that.
[4059.64 → 4059.74] Yeah.
[4059.82 → 4060.16] Absolutely.
[4060.66 → 4063.16] I wish my Year of the Dragon had the fade away.
[4063.76 → 4063.98] Yeah.
[4063.98 → 4064.64] That would be awesome.
[4064.74 → 4065.54] But I still love it.
[4065.98 → 4066.30] Yeah.
[4066.48 → 4066.62] Yeah.
[4067.52 → 4068.12] So yeah.
[4068.22 → 4069.08] If no one caught that.
[4069.14 → 4069.98] He has a Year of the Dragon.
[4070.10 → 4071.84] Which is pretty badass.
[4072.84 → 4073.32] Um.
[4073.48 → 4074.22] Do do do.
[4076.70 → 4078.84] Bottlenecking is a really weird concept.
[4078.84 → 4080.82] I actually saw that tweet.
[4081.50 → 4081.86] Um.
[4082.14 → 4082.88] While you were talking.
[4083.00 → 4084.22] And there's just not enough information there.
[4085.60 → 4086.20] I feel.
[4086.54 → 4088.74] I would post your entire system spec on the forum.
[4089.10 → 4090.54] And then try and get people to help you.
[4090.66 → 4093.56] Because I'm assuming you're trying to squeeze more frames out in video games.
[4094.70 → 4095.06] Um.
[4096.20 → 4096.86] But like.
[4096.96 → 4097.94] Like what are you trying to do?
[4098.00 → 4099.38] Are you trying to render videos?
[4099.48 → 4100.48] Are you trying to play video games?
[4100.72 → 4102.26] Because it's different depending on what you're doing.
[4102.26 → 4102.28] Yeah.
[4102.28 → 4102.66] What's the.
[4103.00 → 4105.88] Or do you just want a quicker interaction with your computer?
[4106.10 → 4106.28] Yeah.
[4106.28 → 4107.00] Something like.
[4107.32 → 4108.38] You know like you want Windows quicker.
[4108.38 → 4109.08] Or your Chrome.
[4109.32 → 4109.72] Or you know.
[4109.76 → 4110.16] Your email.
[4110.28 → 4110.64] Stuff like that.
[4110.68 → 4111.28] Then I would say.
[4111.68 → 4112.84] Well don't worry about those stats.
[4112.90 → 4113.04] You know.
[4113.04 → 4113.68] Grab an SSD.
[4113.94 → 4114.36] Or something like.
[4114.38 → 4115.26] Or does he have an SSD?
[4115.74 → 4116.36] I don't know.
[4116.58 → 4118.24] So post all your specs on the forum.
[4118.28 → 4119.06] And try and get help there.
[4119.40 → 4121.78] Someone asked what I'm running in Star Citizen for packages.
[4122.02 → 4122.92] I have a Hornet.
[4123.10 → 4124.52] And a Drake Cutlass.
[4126.18 → 4126.62] Um.
[4126.72 → 4128.82] Hybrid drive versus SSD cache.
[4128.96 → 4130.00] For gaming and light work.
[4130.60 → 4131.00] Um.
[4132.36 → 4132.68] I am.
[4132.74 → 4132.98] I am.
[4132.98 → 4133.10] I am.
[4133.10 → 4133.96] I'm interested in this.
[4134.00 → 4134.58] I'm going to sit back.
[4134.66 → 4135.74] Just like everyone watching right now.
[4136.00 → 4137.42] I'm interested on this question.
[4137.42 → 4138.28] It's interesting.
[4138.60 → 4138.98] Um.
[4139.04 → 4140.26] You're going to spend more money.
[4141.08 → 4142.50] With an SSD cache.
[4142.62 → 4143.82] Because then you have to buy.
[4144.44 → 4145.74] An SSD and a hard drive.
[4146.08 → 4146.50] Mm-hmm.
[4146.60 → 4147.28] Um.
[4147.28 → 4147.36] Um.
[4147.64 → 4148.88] Albeit a small SSD.
[4149.54 → 4150.14] But still.
[4150.24 → 4150.74] Still expensive.
[4150.96 → 4151.36] Um.
[4151.42 → 4152.18] And you'll get.
[4152.64 → 4153.88] A better experience with that.
[4153.92 → 4154.78] But you're spending more money.
[4154.90 → 4155.32] So it's.
[4155.60 → 4156.50] Like a hybrid drive is.
[4156.80 → 4157.66] In my opinion.
[4157.94 → 4158.12] I.
[4158.20 → 4159.62] I'm running a hybrid drive in my laptop.
[4160.00 → 4161.24] I'm running a Moments XT.
[4161.42 → 4161.74] Now.
[4161.88 → 4162.66] I like that.
[4162.72 → 4164.22] Because I have a bunch of storage.
[4164.38 → 4165.62] It didn't cost me a ton of money.
[4165.82 → 4166.22] And it's.
[4166.88 → 4167.64] Pretty quick.
[4167.76 → 4168.88] It's not superfast.
[4168.92 → 4169.30] But it's.
[4169.46 → 4170.18] Fast enough.
[4170.76 → 4171.16] Um.
[4171.16 → 4171.54] For me.
[4171.84 → 4172.64] So if you.
[4173.02 → 4174.28] Need that speed.
[4174.94 → 4175.22] I am.
[4175.22 → 4176.28] I'm assuming you're dealing with a desktop.
[4176.44 → 4177.10] Because it's two drives.
[4177.32 → 4178.08] If you need that speed.
[4178.12 → 4179.18] You can set up that cache.
[4179.74 → 4180.14] Um.
[4180.16 → 4181.30] But you're getting into the point.
[4181.38 → 4181.70] Where like.
[4181.76 → 4183.52] You might as well spend the 50 extra bucks.
[4183.58 → 4184.94] And then just have a dedicated SD.
[4185.30 → 4185.50] Uh.
[4185.50 → 4185.78] SSD.
[4186.80 → 4187.12] So.
[4187.50 → 4188.06] I don't know.
[4188.18 → 4188.30] I am.
[4188.46 → 4188.78] Personally.
[4188.94 → 4189.60] I would either go.
[4189.68 → 4189.78] If.
[4189.82 → 4190.76] If you're strapped for cache.
[4190.82 → 4191.74] I would buy a hybrid drive.
[4191.94 → 4193.06] If you're not strapped for cache.
[4193.10 → 4193.72] I would buy an SSD.
[4193.72 → 4194.48] And a hard drive.
[4194.56 → 4195.22] And run them separately.
[4195.96 → 4196.94] And run like your OS.
[4197.00 → 4198.32] And maybe a few core programs.
[4198.76 → 4199.98] On the dedicated SSD.
[4200.28 → 4201.18] And then just a hard drive.
[4201.18 → 4201.74] For storage.
[4202.28 → 4202.48] So.
[4202.68 → 4203.18] That's what I do.
[4203.38 → 4203.60] Yeah.
[4203.84 → 4204.02] Yeah.
[4205.46 → 4206.94] Do we have plans for another build log.
[4206.98 → 4207.40] Anytime soon?
[4207.68 → 4208.04] Yes.
[4208.36 → 4209.36] Linus will be doing that.
[4210.20 → 4212.02] How do you feel about the Blackberry news?
[4212.66 → 4213.84] I saw that as well.
[4214.24 → 4215.60] I don't know the Blackberry news.
[4215.78 → 4216.08] Me neither.
[4216.10 → 4217.60] I've been so focused on iOS 7.
[4217.70 → 4218.36] Cryogen mod.
[4218.54 → 4218.78] Yeah.
[4218.84 → 4219.62] Unless it's old.
[4220.86 → 4222.02] Unless it's older Blackberry news.
[4222.02 → 4222.44] With them like.
[4223.08 → 4224.10] Looking to sell themselves.
[4225.16 → 4225.50] Oh.
[4225.56 → 4225.94] Is that what.
[4226.18 → 4227.02] But that's kind of older.
[4227.34 → 4227.50] Not.
[4227.80 → 4228.38] That new.
[4229.72 → 4230.04] Yeah.
[4230.30 → 4230.58] Sorry.
[4230.58 → 4231.42] We're going to move on.
[4233.26 → 4234.30] Slick and cold.
[4234.62 → 4234.92] Yeah.
[4235.38 → 4236.00] We got a tweet.
[4236.16 → 4237.06] Got to give a shout-out to mom.
[4237.34 → 4237.74] Hey mom.
[4237.88 → 4238.24] Hi mom.
[4238.32 → 4238.68] How's it going?
[4239.64 → 4240.44] Slick and cold.
[4240.52 → 4242.76] Are you still squealing about Day9TV noticing you guys?
[4242.96 → 4243.58] Just internally.
[4244.04 → 4244.86] Just internally.
[4244.92 → 4245.30] Just internally.
[4245.30 → 4246.40] Now just internally.
[4246.40 → 4247.34] No vocal squealing?
[4247.66 → 4247.98] Well.
[4248.18 → 4248.78] I did a little.
[4249.82 → 4251.36] No more vocal squealing?
[4251.74 → 4252.04] Yes.
[4253.10 → 4253.32] Oh.
[4253.36 → 4254.96] They laid off 40% of their workforce.
[4255.22 → 4255.54] That's.
[4255.78 → 4256.22] Oh.
[4256.38 → 4256.64] Really?
[4256.64 → 4257.82] To be unexpected though.
[4259.48 → 4259.88] Horrible.
[4260.70 → 4262.16] That still really sucks though.
[4262.32 → 4263.28] Of course it does.
[4263.48 → 4264.02] But like.
[4264.92 → 4267.54] That's a lot of additional people looking for jobs.
[4267.74 → 4268.92] In an economy that is.
[4268.92 → 4268.94] Yeah.
[4268.94 → 4271.38] Is not very accepting of that right now.
[4271.48 → 4272.14] But to be honest.
[4272.20 → 4273.38] If I was a worker of Blackberry.
[4273.64 → 4275.26] I hope they would already be looking.
[4276.26 → 4276.80] That too.
[4276.88 → 4277.56] That's a good point.
[4277.80 → 4278.02] But.
[4278.02 → 4278.50] Because.
[4278.86 → 4280.38] There's been a lot of problems there.
[4280.46 → 4280.66] And like.
[4280.72 → 4281.80] Sometimes you got to read the cards.
[4282.14 → 4282.98] Now a lot of these people.
[4283.22 → 4284.32] Might not be able to get jobs.
[4284.94 → 4287.28] So that's a huge part of the reason why this sucks.
[4287.48 → 4287.88] Because.
[4288.86 → 4290.88] There's not very many places to go.
[4291.04 → 4291.18] But.
[4291.40 → 4291.98] Maybe like.
[4292.10 → 4293.04] Someone just said.
[4293.12 → 4293.28] Hey.
[4293.34 → 4294.94] They can maybe join Cyanogen mod.
[4295.58 → 4296.70] Or Cyano.
[4296.94 → 4298.36] Or whatever they're now calling themselves.
[4298.54 → 4298.96] So that's.
[4300.00 → 4301.58] Blackberry employees in the audience.
[4301.96 → 4302.28] All.
[4302.82 → 4303.92] 40% of you.
[4304.52 → 4305.12] Um.
[4306.46 → 4307.48] Apply to Cyanogen.
[4307.48 → 4307.92] Because.
[4308.34 → 4308.56] That's.
[4308.72 → 4309.86] Probably not a bad idea.
[4310.00 → 4310.96] And you need to move from there.
[4311.04 → 4311.34] Definitely.
[4311.58 → 4312.04] Do you have something to say?
[4312.44 → 4312.80] I.
[4312.88 → 4313.24] I just.
[4313.44 → 4314.58] I feel absolutely blessed.
[4314.72 → 4315.04] I've.
[4315.10 → 4315.76] I've had.
[4316.14 → 4317.34] 39 followers today.
[4317.44 → 4318.82] I'm one away from 300.
[4319.14 → 4319.50] Boom.
[4319.68 → 4319.96] So.
[4320.26 → 4320.58] 300.
[4320.72 → 4321.90] You have to screenshot 300.
[4322.06 → 4322.96] Because that's kind of a cool number.
[4323.24 → 4323.62] That is.
[4323.92 → 4324.82] I've screenshotted.
[4325.10 → 4325.46] Um.
[4325.92 → 4326.38] 5-7.
[4326.84 → 4327.08] No.
[4327.64 → 4327.78] No.
[4327.78 → 4328.30] Not 5-7.
[4328.42 → 4328.54] 5-7.
[4328.76 → 4329.24] I've screenshotted.
[4329.30 → 4329.40] Yeah.
[4329.46 → 4330.14] 1-3-3-7.
[4330.20 → 4330.32] Yeah.
[4330.70 → 4331.10] And.
[4331.38 → 4331.94] I remember that one.
[4332.04 → 4332.70] And 57.
[4333.14 → 4334.58] And I don't know if there were other ones.
[4335.10 → 4335.54] But yeah.
[4335.92 → 4336.68] Pretty epic.
[4337.40 → 4337.88] Do do.
[4338.94 → 4343.08] I think we might be able to be done with.
[4343.90 → 4344.30] Um.
[4344.62 → 4345.54] The Twitter blitz for now.
[4345.68 → 4346.58] We've taken a little bit of.
[4347.02 → 4349.00] A little bit more time than I was hoping to with the Twitter blitz.
[4349.16 → 4349.76] How about one more?
[4349.90 → 4351.18] Because someone tweeted at both of us.
[4351.32 → 4351.74] One more.
[4351.82 → 4352.38] Where's this?
[4352.48 → 4352.62] So.
[4352.72 → 4353.34] It's actually.
[4354.68 → 4354.88] Oh.
[4354.92 → 4355.20] I'm not sure.
[4355.20 → 4356.00] I guess we can't pull it up.
[4356.00 → 4356.42] Because they tweeted.
[4356.58 → 4356.92] They tweeted.
[4357.00 → 4357.62] 36 seconds.
[4357.62 → 4357.88] You can switch to your.
[4357.88 → 4358.56] Because they're at the very top.
[4358.82 → 4359.08] Boom.
[4359.72 → 4360.12] Uh.
[4360.30 → 4360.62] Boom.
[4361.76 → 4362.36] There we go.
[4362.48 → 4362.66] Okay.
[4362.90 → 4363.22] So.
[4364.28 → 4365.14] Amit Noreen.
[4365.14 → 4367.18] Or is it a meat Noreen?
[4367.28 → 4367.52] I know.
[4367.60 → 4367.88] Because I.
[4367.88 → 4369.86] I've actually known two people.
[4370.40 → 4370.76] Uh.
[4371.26 → 4371.58] With.
[4371.70 → 4372.64] It's spelled A-M-I-T.
[4372.74 → 4373.36] One was meat.
[4373.46 → 4374.28] And one was Amit.
[4374.42 → 4375.80] So I'm not actually sure which one that is.
[4376.04 → 4376.28] But saying.
[4376.34 → 4377.18] What do you run on your personal rigs?
[4377.18 → 4378.22] I run a 3770.
[4378.60 → 4378.88] Okay.
[4378.88 → 4379.64] Um.
[4380.00 → 4381.46] With an MSI 660 Ti.
[4382.12 → 4383.20] I have a.
[4383.66 → 4384.82] Which I actually got from you.
[4384.98 → 4385.64] For my birthday.
[4385.76 → 4386.34] Which was pretty cool.
[4386.40 → 4386.90] I got a Samsung.
[4387.52 → 4387.82] Uh.
[4387.88 → 4388.42] 840.
[4388.60 → 4388.80] No.
[4388.86 → 4389.26] 890.
[4389.78 → 4390.72] Samsung 840 Pro.
[4390.88 → 4391.64] 840 Pro.
[4391.74 → 4392.50] It's 840 Pro.
[4392.62 → 4392.86] Uh.
[4392.86 → 4393.20] SSD.
[4393.86 → 4394.36] And then.
[4394.56 → 4394.68] Uh.
[4394.90 → 4396.50] I have my black and my green.
[4396.50 → 4397.84] Western Digital Drives for storage.
[4398.62 → 4398.98] Um.
[4399.54 → 4400.38] I think I covered everything.
[4400.54 → 4401.60] I got 16 gigs of RAM in there.
[4401.68 → 4401.96] Basically.
[4402.30 → 4402.44] Yeah.
[4402.52 → 4403.52] There are a few more components.
[4403.74 → 4403.76] But.
[4404.02 → 4405.40] Like the main two things that really matter.
[4405.52 → 4406.02] In my opinion.
[4406.10 → 4407.20] When someone asks you your system specs.
[4407.26 → 4408.62] It's like your processor and graphics card.
[4408.88 → 4409.28] Yeah.
[4409.36 → 4410.00] For what I'm doing.
[4410.10 → 4410.96] So like you covered those.
[4411.14 → 4411.24] Yeah.
[4411.24 → 4414.56] So my like really baseline idea of my system specs.
[4414.72 → 4416.18] And now these are subject to change.
[4416.28 → 4419.30] I'm planning on bringing a completely new rig.
[4419.38 → 4420.98] Which I will be doing a build log for.
[4421.06 → 4421.98] And all that kind of stuff for.
[4421.98 → 4424.42] The PAX BYOC LAN next year.
[4424.66 → 4426.16] I was going to do it this year.
[4426.26 → 4426.86] But then I was like.
[4426.98 → 4428.34] I don't have enough time or finances.
[4428.74 → 4429.92] To get this done properly.
[4430.06 → 4431.02] And I want to do it properly.
[4431.20 → 4432.58] So for next year BYOC.
[4432.86 → 4434.02] I'm planning on having a new rig.
[4434.10 → 4434.56] But anyway.
[4434.66 → 4436.28] Right now I'm running a 2600k.
[4436.50 → 4438.58] And a Galaxy Super Blocked.
[4438.58 → 4439.40] 660 Ti.
[4440.08 → 4440.32] Cool.
[4440.74 → 4440.92] Yeah.
[4441.20 → 4441.56] It does.
[4441.68 → 4442.44] It kind of.
[4442.66 → 4444.38] It could get more performance.
[4444.62 → 4445.86] I would like more performance.
[4448.00 → 4448.44] But.
[4449.30 → 4450.56] Oh well.
[4450.76 → 4452.70] What I've recently invested in.
[4452.74 → 4453.20] In my computer.
[4453.20 → 4454.14] Was actually four.
[4454.36 → 4455.94] Three terabyte WD RED drives.
[4456.34 → 4457.20] That I put in RED 1.
[4457.20 → 4458.20] One.
[4458.20 → 4458.24] Because.
[4458.72 → 4459.34] Right now.
[4459.44 → 4459.58] Like.
[4459.74 → 4459.98] I got.
[4460.12 → 4461.38] I recently purchased an Oculus.
[4461.94 → 4463.24] That's going to show up in October.
[4464.24 → 4465.16] But right now.
[4465.24 → 4466.40] Without the Oculus running.
[4466.50 → 4467.56] I can run most games.
[4467.62 → 4469.10] At fairly acceptable settings.
[4469.32 → 4470.46] And fairly acceptable frame rates.
[4470.80 → 4472.02] Once the Oculus shows up.
[4472.12 → 4473.68] I'm probably going to have to upgrade my graphics.
[4473.68 → 4476.04] Because that's so much harder to run.
[4476.60 → 4476.96] 2600k.
[4477.02 → 4477.96] I'm not too worried about upgrading.
[4478.38 → 4479.08] To be completely honest.
[4479.16 → 4480.76] I'm quite happy with my 2600k.
[4480.82 → 4481.18] And I think.
[4481.42 → 4483.04] I'm pretty sure the ban on my 2600k.
[4483.10 → 4483.74] Is pretty nice.
[4484.30 → 4484.50] Yeah.
[4484.56 → 4486.54] Because I've gotten it to some pretty insane settings.
[4486.68 → 4488.18] So I like my 2600k.
[4488.32 → 4490.36] But the graphics card will probably have to change soon.
[4491.00 → 4491.18] Yeah.
[4491.18 → 4492.56] We should come back to Twitter later.
[4492.66 → 4494.48] Because I love interacting with Twitter and chats.
[4494.70 → 4494.72] Yeah.
[4494.72 → 4494.86] No.
[4494.86 → 4495.16] Seriously.
[4495.34 → 4496.26] We could never stop.
[4496.38 → 4498.20] So we need to put a hard period on here.
[4498.34 → 4498.56] Sure.
[4498.88 → 4499.10] Sure.
[4499.44 → 4500.34] So we'll move on for now.
[4500.56 → 4501.82] And one thing in the after party.
[4501.94 → 4504.84] We'll try and have a lot of fan interaction during the after party.
[4505.30 → 4505.70] So now.
[4505.94 → 4506.52] That's one thing.
[4506.68 → 4507.78] Because I stream a bit too.
[4508.00 → 4508.36] Obviously.
[4508.68 → 4512.14] My younger brother here is completely e-famous.
[4512.26 → 4512.84] You guys love him.
[4512.86 → 4513.32] Which is awesome.
[4513.40 → 4514.28] He absolutely deserves it.
[4514.38 → 4516.58] But I try to do that a lot.
[4516.64 → 4518.28] But it's hard when you have this many people.
[4518.58 → 4518.68] Yeah.
[4518.68 → 4519.68] Because when I stream.
[4519.68 → 4520.36] Our events.
[4520.54 → 4522.22] We can get a couple of hundred people.
[4522.38 → 4523.06] And it's a lot of fun.
[4523.92 → 4524.68] But the chat goes much slower.
[4525.16 → 4526.66] And it's much.
[4526.78 → 4528.48] It's hard to keep track of this.
[4528.54 → 4528.84] But what do you.
[4528.90 → 4529.96] Do you want to jump into the.
[4530.50 → 4531.48] The depressing topic.
[4532.52 → 4534.30] I almost don't really want to cover this.
[4534.58 → 4534.82] But.
[4535.72 → 4536.76] We kind of have to.
[4537.28 → 4537.52] So.
[4537.94 → 4538.98] Hiroshi Yamauchi.
[4539.44 → 4540.20] From Nintendo.
[4540.76 → 4542.12] Has passed away.
[4542.44 → 4542.84] Recently.
[4543.14 → 4543.90] Which is like.
[4544.00 → 4544.78] Super depressing.
[4545.72 → 4546.20] And.
[4547.40 → 4547.84] Yeah.
[4548.44 → 4548.88] I am.
[4548.88 → 4549.90] I'm going to go through like.
[4550.02 → 4551.42] A very short history of Nintendo.
[4552.02 → 4553.34] And I'm going to tweet out.
[4553.34 → 4554.12] Um.
[4554.12 → 4555.66] A few different links here.
[4556.28 → 4557.22] So that you guys can see.
[4557.30 → 4557.90] One of these.
[4558.02 → 4559.20] Is a Kodak link.
[4559.68 → 4560.12] About.
[4560.64 → 4561.04] Um.
[4561.68 → 4562.48] The Nintendo.
[4562.66 → 4563.78] They tried to forget.
[4564.04 → 4564.84] Which is like.
[4565.36 → 4565.92] Um.
[4566.12 → 4567.72] Nintendo's weird history.
[4568.00 → 4569.28] And some of the stuff they've done.
[4569.68 → 4570.20] Including.
[4570.64 → 4571.74] Making cards.
[4571.98 → 4572.52] And making.
[4573.16 → 4573.56] Um.
[4573.60 → 4575.06] I think appliances at some point.
[4575.14 → 4576.16] And a love hotel.
[4576.26 → 4577.06] Which is awkward.
[4577.20 → 4578.16] A taxi service.
[4578.28 → 4578.98] Toy blocks.
[4579.14 → 4579.58] Noodles.
[4580.16 → 4580.40] Like.
[4580.48 → 4581.28] They've made everything.
[4581.36 → 4581.60] Literally.
[4581.80 → 4581.98] Okay.
[4581.98 → 4582.34] So.
[4583.70 → 4585.02] Yamaguchi took over Nintendo.
[4585.48 → 4586.50] Making playing cards.
[4586.70 → 4587.30] In 1989.
[4587.58 → 4588.14] When his grandfather.
[4588.34 → 4588.80] Passed away.
[4588.98 → 4589.38] In 19.
[4589.84 → 4590.08] With.
[4590.22 → 4590.36] Okay.
[4590.44 → 4591.54] They've been making playing cards.
[4591.68 → 4591.80] From.
[4592.16 → 4592.38] Since.
[4593.20 → 4593.60] 1889.
[4593.82 → 4594.20] There we go.
[4594.26 → 4594.80] Too many dates.
[4594.92 → 4595.04] Yeah.
[4595.22 → 4595.76] His grandfather.
[4595.94 → 4596.42] Passed away.
[4596.54 → 4597.32] In 1949.
[4597.32 → 4598.34] And he took over.
[4598.64 → 4599.62] And then when he took over.
[4599.70 → 4600.02] He was like.
[4600.10 → 4600.84] I'm an entrepreneur.
[4601.56 → 4603.18] I will take this company further.
[4603.82 → 4604.22] And.
[4604.94 → 4606.30] With his great vision.
[4606.30 → 4607.56] Because he's just such a.
[4607.88 → 4608.36] Powerful.
[4608.46 → 4609.10] Crazy guy.
[4609.10 → 4610.54] He's like the Steve Jobs.
[4610.54 → 4611.10] Of Nintendo.
[4611.30 → 4612.24] Because I've heard, actually.
[4612.38 → 4613.10] That he was pretty hard.
[4613.10 → 4613.70] On his employees.
[4613.82 → 4614.58] And demanded a lot.
[4614.90 → 4616.16] But then the same kind of thing.
[4616.24 → 4617.12] The success you see.
[4617.26 → 4617.68] With Nintendo.
[4617.78 → 4618.62] And the success you see.
[4618.70 → 4619.72] With Apple.
[4619.86 → 4620.14] Was just.
[4620.34 → 4620.66] Crazy.
[4620.98 → 4622.42] They both started from fairly.
[4623.46 → 4623.86] Moderate.
[4624.06 → 4624.46] Beginnings.
[4624.88 → 4625.42] And they just.
[4626.28 → 4626.64] Boom.
[4627.04 → 4628.30] Which is just crazy.
[4628.90 → 4629.18] So.
[4629.42 → 4630.42] Well they still made some of the.
[4630.52 → 4630.66] You know.
[4630.74 → 4631.50] Super Mario Brothers.
[4631.60 → 4632.68] Is one of the best games.
[4632.88 → 4633.12] Ever.
[4633.60 → 4634.32] It still is.
[4634.32 → 4634.34] You know.
[4634.34 → 4635.58] It's just a ton of fun to play.
[4635.66 → 4636.60] I know we were playing it.
[4637.14 → 4637.46] Uh.
[4637.46 → 4640.30] Maybe this was actually a little bit of a while.
[4640.46 → 4640.68] You know.
[4640.74 → 4641.14] Maybe five.
[4641.20 → 4641.68] Six months ago.
[4641.86 → 4642.68] But we had it set up.
[4642.72 → 4643.66] And we were playing a ton of it.
[4643.88 → 4644.02] Yeah.
[4644.74 → 4645.90] It's still so much fun.
[4646.00 → 4646.20] Yeah.
[4646.28 → 4647.10] Just at mom's house there.
[4647.16 → 4647.40] It was just.
[4647.46 → 4647.58] Yeah.
[4647.62 → 4648.18] It was a ton of fun.
[4648.22 → 4649.48] Just switching the controller back and forth.
[4649.58 → 4651.00] And playing the side scroller.
[4651.10 → 4651.28] It was.
[4651.46 → 4651.72] You know.
[4651.76 → 4652.14] It was great.
[4652.14 → 4652.22] It was fun.
[4652.34 → 4652.48] Yeah.
[4652.48 → 4652.86] And like.
[4652.86 → 4653.86] Even their ancient games.
[4653.92 → 4654.60] Even their new games.
[4654.74 → 4655.58] They're still fun.
[4655.88 → 4656.14] And like.
[4656.14 → 4656.84] Someone just said.
[4657.02 → 4657.32] Um.
[4657.32 → 4658.38] They're comparing it to.
[4658.62 → 4659.82] Gabe Newell for Valve.
[4659.94 → 4660.20] And like.
[4660.38 → 4660.54] It's.
[4660.62 → 4661.20] Oh absolutely.
[4661.46 → 4661.64] Yeah.
[4662.30 → 4662.60] Yeah.
[4662.60 → 4663.90] It's just the iconic leader.
[4664.52 → 4664.92] Of.
[4665.52 → 4666.68] Of an incredible company.
[4666.82 → 4666.94] Yeah.
[4666.94 → 4667.84] That has made such an impression.
[4668.36 → 4668.82] On you.
[4668.88 → 4669.02] You know.
[4669.08 → 4669.68] I'm not necessarily.
[4669.92 → 4670.96] A huge Apple fan myself.
[4671.12 → 4672.32] But those who enjoy their products.
[4672.78 → 4674.44] Hold Steve Jobs to such a.
[4674.66 → 4675.64] A high standard almost.
[4675.64 → 4675.88] It makes sense.
[4675.88 → 4676.20] You know.
[4676.46 → 4677.28] On that kind of pedestal.
[4677.36 → 4677.52] You know.
[4677.58 → 4678.62] Gabe is one of those as well.
[4678.76 → 4679.82] I'm a huge Valve fan.
[4679.86 → 4680.60] I've got the lanyard.
[4680.76 → 4680.94] Yeah.
[4680.94 → 4681.46] You know.
[4681.66 → 4682.02] From.
[4682.18 → 4683.60] From the original Half-Life games.
[4683.70 → 4685.88] That just completely took me into Counter-Strike.
[4686.32 → 4686.64] Uh.
[4686.64 → 4686.76] To.
[4686.86 → 4687.56] To all that kind of stuff.
[4687.60 → 4689.26] And Counter-Strike was a huge part of our childhood.
[4689.52 → 4689.84] Absolutely.
[4689.94 → 4690.62] Counter-Strike was big.
[4690.70 → 4691.66] Counter-Strike was a ton of fun.
[4691.70 → 4692.36] It was always that.
[4692.72 → 4693.06] That.
[4693.06 → 4693.22] Uh.
[4693.80 → 4694.84] At that time at least.
[4694.96 → 4696.20] We weren't into Star craft quite yet.
[4696.32 → 4696.60] But it was that.
[4696.60 → 4697.38] It was that competitive.
[4697.78 → 4697.94] Yep.
[4698.40 → 4698.72] Edgy.
[4699.28 → 4699.58] You know.
[4699.64 → 4699.92] You know.
[4699.94 → 4701.28] Game that you would play that kind of.
[4701.50 → 4701.86] Uh.
[4702.36 → 4702.82] Ranks you.
[4702.88 → 4702.96] You know.
[4702.98 → 4703.58] How good are you?
[4703.64 → 4704.38] Jump on Counter-Strike.
[4704.50 → 4705.80] You die instantly man.
[4705.86 → 4706.44] It's so hard.
[4706.54 → 4706.92] You jump right.
[4706.92 → 4707.14] You know.
[4707.24 → 4707.38] And I.
[4707.74 → 4708.28] It was.
[4708.48 → 4708.72] Uh.
[4708.72 → 4709.16] I remember.
[4709.52 → 4709.74] You know.
[4709.76 → 4710.44] Being in middle school.
[4710.52 → 4710.90] And it was just.
[4710.96 → 4712.00] It was such a big deal.
[4712.26 → 4712.66] You know.
[4712.66 → 4713.38] How hard it was.
[4713.44 → 4715.44] I still remember being upstairs in that computer room.
[4715.58 → 4716.66] And the first day.
[4716.76 → 4719.36] That I was able to get a kill death ratio.
[4719.44 → 4720.40] That was above one.
[4720.52 → 4721.06] I was just like.
[4721.54 → 4721.94] Yeah.
[4722.52 → 4723.36] Look at what I did.
[4723.40 → 4724.04] Look at what I did.
[4724.06 → 4724.48] I'm the best.
[4724.82 → 4726.34] I'm so good at everything.
[4727.00 → 4727.44] Um.
[4727.70 → 4727.90] Yeah.
[4728.64 → 4729.20] So anyway.
[4729.54 → 4729.68] He.
[4729.68 → 4729.94] He.
[4730.22 → 4730.52] He.
[4730.88 → 4731.74] Crazy entrepreneur.
[4731.94 → 4732.20] So he.
[4732.20 → 4732.46] He.
[4732.72 → 4733.74] Gains control over Nintendo.
[4733.94 → 4734.46] And then decides.
[4734.56 → 4734.66] Okay.
[4734.74 → 4735.66] I want to try everything.
[4736.06 → 4737.40] So they try making noodle blocks.
[4737.50 → 4738.20] They try making.
[4738.32 → 4738.40] Or.
[4738.58 → 4739.02] Noodle blocks.
[4739.24 → 4740.12] They try making noodles.
[4740.24 → 4741.26] They try making toy blocks.
[4741.34 → 4742.46] They try a taxi service.
[4742.76 → 4744.36] And they even try a love hotel.
[4744.48 → 4745.60] Which gets a little bit interesting.
[4745.82 → 4746.86] He owned the mariners.
[4747.26 → 4747.60] Yeah.
[4748.46 → 4749.54] I'll get into that.
[4749.90 → 4750.10] So.
[4751.02 → 4751.46] Um.
[4751.46 → 4753.08] It was finally in 1977.
[4753.08 → 4755.20] That they decided to get into the video game industry.
[4755.62 → 4758.32] And one of the best moves he probably ever made.
[4758.54 → 4759.88] Was hiring Shigeru Miyamoto.
[4760.20 → 4761.44] I hope I just said his name.
[4761.78 → 4762.22] Correctly.
[4762.30 → 4763.14] But I'm pretty sure I did.
[4763.42 → 4765.56] That guy is the dude behind Donkey Kong.
[4765.62 → 4765.88] Mario.
[4765.98 → 4766.36] And Zelda.
[4766.76 → 4767.58] Which is basically.
[4767.82 → 4768.76] The dude behind.
[4769.60 → 4770.00] Everything.
[4770.58 → 4770.84] Mm-hmm.
[4771.18 → 4771.70] For like.
[4771.78 → 4773.74] So many games that I played when I was younger.
[4774.08 → 4774.72] So much.
[4775.28 → 4776.16] Awesome content.
[4776.32 → 4778.04] That has never really dwindled too much.
[4778.28 → 4780.38] One thing that's interesting about Nintendo game reviews.
[4780.38 → 4781.02] That I notice.
[4781.44 → 4782.06] Is that.
[4782.66 → 4784.18] They always get ranked a little bit lower.
[4784.28 → 4784.50] And they're like.
[4784.58 → 4784.76] Oh.
[4784.84 → 4786.32] They lost the vision that they had.
[4786.40 → 4787.76] When they were a younger company.
[4787.98 → 4788.26] And I'm like.
[4789.72 → 4791.26] Maybe you have a little bit.
[4791.44 → 4793.16] Of correctness when you say that.
[4793.22 → 4794.04] But at the same time.
[4794.10 → 4795.46] They have to change things.
[4796.52 → 4797.56] They have to move forward.
[4797.68 → 4797.96] And I've.
[4798.30 → 4800.18] I'm a huge lover of previous.
[4800.58 → 4801.24] Mario games.
[4801.36 → 4802.12] But the new ones.
[4802.30 → 4803.28] They have good mechanics.
[4803.66 → 4803.82] Yeah.
[4803.82 → 4805.16] And they're bringing in interesting stuff.
[4805.36 → 4807.26] And I don't think you can hate on them that much.
[4807.26 → 4808.66] Just because you have such.
[4808.66 → 4811.18] A desire to play the old games.
[4811.32 → 4813.00] It's the exact same thing with music.
[4813.34 → 4813.54] Yeah.
[4813.66 → 4814.46] And bands.
[4814.70 → 4815.00] That.
[4815.52 → 4817.32] You expect them when they come out of high school.
[4817.44 → 4817.96] And they're making.
[4818.44 → 4818.70] You know.
[4818.74 → 4819.92] They're kind of edgy stuff.
[4820.00 → 4821.52] To make the exact same material.
[4821.64 → 4822.44] 30 years later.
[4822.44 → 4822.82] Yeah.
[4823.04 → 4823.86] When they have.
[4824.32 → 4825.00] Two kids.
[4825.22 → 4825.76] Two houses.
[4826.08 → 4826.30] You know.
[4826.30 → 4826.70] All this kind of.
[4826.86 → 4828.12] When their world is literally.
[4828.12 → 4829.22] Could not be more different.
[4829.32 → 4830.04] They cannot come out.
[4830.18 → 4831.44] With the exact same stuff.
[4831.52 → 4832.30] They have to.
[4832.90 → 4833.64] Develop and change.
[4833.72 → 4835.06] Because they are developing and changing.
[4835.12 → 4835.22] Yeah.
[4835.22 → 4835.82] You know.
[4835.94 → 4837.18] You can't just stay static.
[4837.26 → 4838.80] They can't come out with a side scroller.
[4839.12 → 4839.76] Every year.
[4840.10 → 4840.72] For 20 years.
[4840.78 → 4841.54] It's just not going to work.
[4842.00 → 4842.20] You know.
[4842.24 → 4843.18] And if they tried.
[4843.24 → 4844.10] They would almost be doing shame.
[4844.16 → 4845.00] To what they did have.
[4845.18 → 4845.62] They still.
[4845.76 → 4846.40] To that classic.
[4846.40 → 4846.72] Do.
[4847.24 → 4847.62] But it's.
[4847.72 → 4847.96] Like.
[4848.06 → 4849.12] It's changed so much.
[4849.14 → 4849.44] But it is.
[4849.44 → 4849.62] Yeah.
[4849.80 → 4850.08] Exactly.
[4850.34 → 4850.52] It is.
[4850.54 → 4851.32] It has changed.
[4851.46 → 4851.62] And they.
[4851.64 → 4852.24] And they have to.
[4852.50 → 4853.90] Even though I'm one of those guys.
[4853.96 → 4854.36] And I'm like.
[4854.40 → 4854.62] You know.
[4855.16 → 4855.44] You know.
[4855.50 → 4855.76] This.
[4856.30 → 4857.42] This brand-new Zelda.
[4857.60 → 4857.82] Isn't.
[4857.92 → 4858.94] Doesn't give me the same feelings.
[4859.04 → 4859.70] That the old one did.
[4859.72 → 4860.46] And it doesn't for me.
[4860.56 → 4860.68] But.
[4865.22 → 4866.34] The exact same thing we did.
[4866.38 → 4867.96] And he's feeling the exact same way we did.
[4868.12 → 4870.28] And he's making the same style of memories that we did.
[4870.40 → 4870.48] So.
[4870.54 → 4870.88] Which is.
[4870.98 → 4871.76] Which is fantastic.
[4872.02 → 4873.24] Nintendo's always been like that.
[4873.34 → 4873.54] So.
[4873.96 → 4874.26] Again.
[4874.32 → 4875.86] I'm super sorry to see this guy go.
[4877.82 → 4878.02] He.
[4878.02 → 4878.22] He.
[4878.30 → 4878.38] He.
[4878.38 → 4879.72] He steps down in 2002.
[4880.58 → 4880.98] And.
[4881.38 → 4881.58] He.
[4882.34 → 4883.74] He's one of the richest men in Japan.
[4883.92 → 4885.52] And one of the funny purchases that he had.
[4885.62 → 4885.98] Was he.
[4886.08 → 4887.96] He was the owner of the Seattle Mariners.
[4888.54 → 4888.88] Which.
[4889.00 → 4890.28] A lot of people don't know.
[4890.38 → 4891.14] But that's true.
[4891.22 → 4892.52] He was the owner of the Seattle Mariners.
[4892.72 → 4893.94] And he finally sold them.
[4894.26 → 4895.20] In 2004.
[4895.72 → 4898.78] He's most well known for making the NEW popular.
[4898.94 → 4900.04] Because at that point in time.
[4900.40 → 4902.66] The video game industry had kind of had a crash.
[4903.04 → 4905.76] And he brought it back with NEW.
[4905.76 → 4906.28] And.
[4907.28 → 4908.52] It's almost seen as the.
[4909.20 → 4909.76] The rebirth.
[4910.76 → 4910.88] Or.
[4911.10 → 4912.14] It's quoted here.
[4913.18 → 4914.76] By Aaron Supports.
[4916.08 → 4916.60] Sports?
[4917.32 → 4917.76] Sports.
[4918.10 → 4918.80] I'm not entirely sure.
[4918.88 → 4920.10] The Verge is Aaron something.
[4920.48 → 4921.20] Starts with an S.
[4921.20 → 4921.98] As.
[4921.98 → 4922.02] As.
[4922.48 → 4923.34] As the catalyst.
[4923.70 → 4925.62] For the rebirth of the video game industry.
[4926.18 → 4926.60] Which like.
[4926.98 → 4927.18] Just.
[4927.90 → 4929.08] Imagine that for a second.
[4929.42 → 4930.76] We might not have.
[4931.46 → 4932.44] So many games.
[4932.52 → 4934.78] We might not have this culture that we have now.
[4935.06 → 4936.48] If it wasn't for him.
[4936.64 → 4938.18] Pushing the NEW as hard as he did.
[4938.56 → 4938.82] So.
[4939.20 → 4939.44] I am.
[4940.38 → 4941.06] Well imagine.
[4941.06 → 4941.58] Very sad.
[4941.60 → 4941.82] You know.
[4941.82 → 4942.86] Imagine the SNES.
[4943.76 → 4944.12] Flopped.
[4944.72 → 4944.96] Yeah.
[4945.60 → 4945.82] Like.
[4946.18 → 4946.78] What would have happened?
[4946.86 → 4948.10] It would be totally different.
[4948.22 → 4948.36] You know.
[4948.40 → 4949.70] Someone was saying Dream cast for the win.
[4949.94 → 4950.98] Dream cast is awesome.
[4951.46 → 4952.50] But not enough to.
[4952.50 → 4953.26] Create.
[4953.62 → 4955.22] And really push the industry through.
[4956.06 → 4956.96] That early years.
[4957.02 → 4957.24] The early.
[4957.24 → 4958.34] Early years is always the hardest.
[4958.42 → 4959.22] And someone was saying Pokémon.
[4959.60 → 4960.46] Pokémon was huge.
[4960.58 → 4962.58] Pokémon was probably a bigger part of our.
[4962.92 → 4964.56] Gaming childhood than even Counter-Strike.
[4964.64 → 4964.76] Yeah.
[4965.66 → 4966.10] You know.
[4966.14 → 4967.14] We both had Red and Blue.
[4967.32 → 4967.76] And you know.
[4967.76 → 4968.46] Played a ton of it.
[4968.84 → 4969.30] And you know.
[4969.30 → 4970.06] Like if those.
[4970.50 → 4970.82] Titles.
[4970.94 → 4971.02] You know.
[4971.08 → 4971.80] Final Fantasy 7.
[4972.66 → 4972.90] You know.
[4972.94 → 4973.66] If those titles.
[4973.78 → 4974.58] Those specific titles.
[4974.70 → 4975.36] Didn't happen.
[4975.94 → 4976.14] You know.
[4976.18 → 4976.94] Where would we be now?
[4976.96 → 4977.86] It's an interesting idea.
[4978.04 → 4978.10] But.
[4979.04 → 4979.36] He.
[4979.46 → 4980.66] He definitely helped shape.
[4980.84 → 4981.88] Where we are now.
[4981.88 → 4982.20] In.
[4983.34 → 4983.72] You know.
[4983.90 → 4985.40] And esports is now a thing.
[4985.60 → 4985.78] Yeah.
[4985.94 → 4986.38] You know.
[4986.46 → 4987.70] And it's only growing.
[4987.80 → 4989.52] It has never taken a step back.
[4989.64 → 4990.22] And he's.
[4990.54 → 4991.66] He was the catalyst.
[4992.06 → 4992.46] And the.
[4993.28 → 4993.64] Absolutely.
[4993.64 → 4994.06] The rebirth of the.
[4994.16 → 4994.36] Yeah.
[4994.56 → 4995.70] Which is super cool.
[4996.04 → 4996.58] And like.
[4996.84 → 4997.12] Oh.
[4997.12 → 4997.48] Yeah.
[4997.72 → 4998.72] It's just freaking awesome.
[4998.90 → 5000.02] If you're big into computers.
[5000.22 → 5000.92] Video games.
[5001.48 → 5001.70] You know.
[5001.80 → 5002.50] They're combined.
[5002.62 → 5003.92] But even if you're one and not the other.
[5004.36 → 5005.02] You still.
[5005.90 → 5006.76] Still have a.
[5006.86 → 5007.00] You know.
[5007.06 → 5008.10] Maybe a moment of silence.
[5008.10 → 5008.58] Or something.
[5008.82 → 5008.98] You know.
[5009.06 → 5009.28] Yeah.
[5009.40 → 5009.92] Remember this.
[5009.98 → 5011.08] Remember this man with respect.
[5011.08 → 5011.94] I kind of did.
[5012.06 → 5013.50] Because I read the article last night.
[5013.96 → 5014.20] Yeah.
[5014.28 → 5015.26] For like the third time.
[5015.32 → 5015.70] Because it's.
[5015.90 → 5017.18] I can't remember exactly when it happened.
[5017.34 → 5017.46] But.
[5018.46 → 5018.78] After.
[5018.94 → 5020.34] After I was finally off work.
[5020.46 → 5021.88] And able to sit down and read the article.
[5022.00 → 5022.64] I just sat there.
[5022.70 → 5023.22] And was just like.
[5023.28 → 5023.58] Wow.
[5025.18 → 5026.12] Holy crap.
[5026.28 → 5027.30] That actually just happened.
[5027.42 → 5029.30] Like that's such a big momentum change.
[5029.36 → 5029.52] Like.
[5029.56 → 5029.70] Yeah.
[5029.70 → 5031.42] He stepped down from the company a while ago.
[5031.42 → 5032.34] But it's still like.
[5032.52 → 5032.98] Holy cow.
[5033.02 → 5033.66] This guy's gone.
[5034.08 → 5034.32] Yeah.
[5034.32 → 5034.72] Which is just.
[5035.44 → 5036.42] So not cool.
[5036.52 → 5037.90] And so crazy at the same time.
[5039.26 → 5041.52] So we're going to move on to a less depressing.
[5042.28 → 5043.28] But in my opinion.
[5043.66 → 5045.42] Not astounding or interesting.
[5046.32 → 5047.18] But anyway.
[5047.36 → 5050.06] PlayStation 4 will support video capture via HDMI.
[5050.30 → 5052.02] PlayStation 3 did not support this.
[5052.56 → 5053.10] Pretty cool.
[5053.66 → 5053.94] But we were.
[5054.06 → 5054.32] Like.
[5054.32 → 5056.24] We were actually at PAX with.
[5057.46 → 5058.64] And we were watching a panel.
[5059.46 → 5060.58] And they were talking about.
[5060.66 → 5060.76] You know.
[5060.82 → 5061.66] How can you capture.
[5062.00 → 5062.92] Out of a PS3.
[5063.00 → 5063.56] Out of an Xbox.
[5063.76 → 5064.66] It was a live-streaming.
[5065.24 → 5065.52] Panel.
[5065.90 → 5066.64] And it was fascinating.
[5066.74 → 5067.32] There's a lot of people there.
[5067.36 → 5067.86] With a lot of questions.
[5067.96 → 5068.56] Obviously I am.
[5069.32 → 5070.44] Not big into the consoles.
[5071.14 → 5073.10] But they have to figure out a way for them to stream.
[5073.42 → 5073.56] You know.
[5073.58 → 5074.08] Xbox One.
[5074.12 → 5075.64] PlayStation 4 is going to fix that.
[5076.00 → 5077.08] With stuff like this.
[5077.14 → 5078.06] Capture straight from HDMI.
[5078.26 → 5079.48] Usually they try and block that.
[5079.58 → 5080.66] They actually go out of their way.
[5080.90 → 5082.24] They try to not allow that.
[5082.24 → 5082.52] Yeah.
[5082.94 → 5084.30] And it seems like PS4.
[5084.32 → 5084.54] They're obvious.
[5084.62 → 5085.82] I'm not completely up on the news.
[5086.14 → 5088.00] But it does seem like they're doing everything they can.
[5088.08 → 5089.96] To appease their customer base.
[5090.24 → 5091.12] Said you guys want this.
[5091.18 → 5091.70] You don't want that.
[5091.76 → 5092.24] That's what we're doing.
[5092.30 → 5093.26] I remember the gift came out.
[5093.70 → 5095.08] And I don't even know who it was.
[5095.14 → 5096.06] They were both wearing suits.
[5096.28 → 5098.66] I believe they were decently high up in PlayStation.
[5099.20 → 5099.64] And they said.
[5099.84 → 5100.66] I don't have my phone.
[5100.78 → 5101.52] This is how you share games?
[5101.64 → 5101.86] Yes.
[5101.98 → 5102.12] Yeah.
[5102.36 → 5103.54] This is how you share games.
[5103.84 → 5104.52] And he was just.
[5105.06 → 5105.78] Why thank you sir.
[5105.90 → 5106.12] Yeah.
[5106.12 → 5106.52] You know.
[5106.84 → 5108.20] And that's how you share.
[5108.66 → 5110.84] Just poking fun obviously at the Xbox.
[5110.84 → 5111.32] It was awesome.
[5112.26 → 5112.54] It's.
[5112.80 → 5112.92] I.
[5112.92 → 5116.22] I really enjoy the angle that PS4 has been taking.
[5116.30 → 5117.82] At least all the media that I'm seeing on it.
[5118.16 → 5119.26] Really seem to.
[5120.18 → 5122.26] To show that they respect and listen to their.
[5122.36 → 5122.54] Yeah.
[5122.58 → 5123.34] Which is really cool.
[5123.48 → 5123.78] And like.
[5123.78 → 5126.04] I'm not even interested in buying one.
[5126.16 → 5128.06] Until they hopefully release some variation.
[5128.24 → 5129.54] So like PlayStation Slim or whatever.
[5129.68 → 5130.78] Of the new consoles.
[5130.98 → 5131.10] But.
[5131.50 → 5133.12] It's still kind of cool to see this.
[5133.56 → 5134.00] But.
[5135.44 → 5137.58] I hate to poke fun at console gamers.
[5137.74 → 5138.16] But like.
[5138.50 → 5139.94] All I really expect to see from this.
[5140.02 → 5141.20] Is more 360 no scopes.
[5141.36 → 5142.94] And GTA car crashes on YouTube.
[5142.94 → 5143.64] Which is like.
[5145.70 → 5146.10] Okay.
[5147.78 → 5148.58] I don't.
[5148.58 → 5148.90] I can't.
[5149.14 → 5149.26] Really.
[5149.40 → 5149.56] Yeah.
[5149.64 → 5150.10] It's going to slide.
[5150.10 → 5150.82] I can't lift my hands.
[5151.10 → 5154.04] But I don't really think it's like way too interesting.
[5154.54 → 5157.10] One thing that I forgot to bring up during the Nintendo article.
[5157.26 → 5157.58] That I saw.
[5157.94 → 5160.06] Someone in chat said Dream cast was awesome.
[5160.52 → 5160.92] Dream cast.
[5161.04 → 5162.68] They're still releasing games.
[5164.06 → 5164.86] There's indie groups.
[5164.94 → 5165.48] Did you know that?
[5165.52 → 5167.90] There's indie groups still releasing games for Dream cast.
[5167.90 → 5168.08] Really?
[5168.26 → 5170.42] Because it's such a good platform to develop on.
[5171.28 → 5172.10] I had no idea.
[5172.28 → 5173.10] It's crazy.
[5173.24 → 5174.00] They're still releasing games.
[5174.04 → 5177.08] They're still releasing games for a lot of old consoles, actually.
[5177.44 → 5180.74] But Dream cast is one of the most interesting development circles.
[5181.62 → 5183.00] That I could possibly find.
[5186.32 → 5188.14] This Dream might be dead.
[5188.94 → 5189.94] No one's saying anything yet.
[5190.16 → 5191.80] No one's saying anything at all yet.
[5195.96 → 5196.40] Hello?
[5196.40 → 5198.60] No one's saying anything.
[5198.60 → 5200.82] I'm not entirely sure if we're still live.
[5200.96 → 5201.66] It is live.
[5201.80 → 5202.12] Okay.
[5202.36 → 5202.90] We're good.
[5203.78 → 5204.68] No it's not.
[5204.80 → 5205.66] It's not live.
[5206.60 → 5207.24] It's fine.
[5207.36 → 5207.76] It's live.
[5207.86 → 5208.06] Okay.
[5208.16 → 5208.46] We're good.
[5208.56 → 5209.28] We're moving forward.
[5209.54 → 5209.72] Okay.
[5209.82 → 5210.02] Alright.
[5210.98 → 5211.38] Yeah.
[5212.90 → 5213.38] Anyway.
[5214.00 → 5215.26] We're going to jump into...
[5215.26 → 5216.48] I'm going to skip one topic.
[5216.64 → 5218.50] So we'll jump back to that autopilot thingy.
[5218.64 → 5218.78] Sure.
[5218.78 → 5222.62] But what I'm going to go to right now is Firefly MMO is on the way.
[5223.04 → 5223.48] Crap.
[5225.44 → 5226.12] Damn it.
[5226.40 → 5226.76] Why?
[5228.02 → 5228.98] Why is this happening?
[5229.14 → 5229.54] Anyway.
[5229.64 → 5234.00] To explain why I'm sad about something awesome coming into existence.
[5234.44 → 5239.72] The description for the Firefly MMO that is on the way is social online role playing game.
[5239.86 → 5244.32] If you're looking for other games by that subscription you would be looking at Farmville and Mafia Wars.
[5245.32 → 5247.08] And other games of that type.
[5247.08 → 5252.08] Do they not...
[5252.08 → 5255.40] It hurts my brain to even think about this.
[5255.40 → 5258.88] Would you say they understand or do not understand their target audience?
[5258.88 → 5259.30] Do not.
[5259.44 → 5260.82] Like Fox has no idea.
[5260.82 → 5261.46] Who...
[5261.46 → 5262.06] Like...
[5262.06 → 5263.36] They don't even know who to use it.
[5263.36 → 5265.10] No clue who they're targeting at.
[5265.16 → 5266.42] Like they're trying to make this game...
[5266.42 → 5266.80] And you know what?
[5266.80 → 5267.66] I subscribed for it.
[5267.78 → 5268.50] I was like, yep.
[5268.58 → 5269.40] I'll jump on that.
[5269.50 → 5270.36] Because it's Firefly.
[5270.46 → 5271.08] I have to.
[5271.08 → 5272.44] I have to jump on it.
[5272.56 → 5275.14] But it still just drives me crazy.
[5275.14 → 5280.86] So they have a slated launch for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets for during summer of 2014.
[5281.22 → 5282.28] So that's a thing.
[5282.64 → 5285.90] It's developed by QM XI and Spark plug Games.
[5286.52 → 5295.14] And if you haven't heard of Spark plug Games, they are the incredible developers behind super well-known games like...
[5296.00 → 5299.96] Drumroll, Plight of the Zombie, and Dairy Queen Tycoon.
[5303.18 → 5304.28] Moving onward.
[5304.68 → 5304.90] Sorry.
[5305.64 → 5307.06] I'm trying to get up on stream for you.
[5307.14 → 5311.66] Although my laptop is dropping the internet every once in a while.
[5311.78 → 5313.00] Which I think is why we lost the stream.
[5313.46 → 5314.46] Oh, that kind of makes sense.
[5314.48 → 5316.08] At least on my screen.
[5316.26 → 5317.92] But this is what you're referring to right here.
[5318.30 → 5318.54] Yep.
[5318.66 → 5319.48] So Plight of the Zombie.
[5319.84 → 5321.40] And this is their game list.
[5321.40 → 5324.48] So from this, Fox was very easy.
[5324.70 → 5328.66] Puzzle Quest, Play the Zombie, DQ Manager, whatever.
[5329.18 → 5334.58] This is the list of games that led Fox to decide that this is the perfect company.
[5334.58 → 5337.80] To develop the idea of Firefly.
[5338.52 → 5342.12] Which is depressing to those of us who love that series.
[5342.12 → 5345.00] Because what I want is a super well-developed big game.
[5345.40 → 5345.60] Yeah.
[5345.60 → 5346.86] That's what I want to see.
[5346.86 → 5348.98] I don't want to see this browser thing.
[5349.18 → 5350.24] This monstrosity.
[5350.62 → 5351.86] So the idea of the game is,
[5351.86 → 5353.22] The players are a captain.
[5353.64 → 5356.62] Your job is to find a crew, find a job, and keep flying.
[5356.80 → 5359.24] Which is like, okay, well-inspired quote, I guess.
[5359.78 → 5361.40] While trading with other players.
[5361.74 → 5363.60] And that's pretty much all we know about the game.
[5363.60 → 5366.86] If you go to the keepflying.com link.
[5367.28 → 5370.82] So if you go to keepflying.com, that is the link for the game.
[5371.20 → 5373.14] This is an official game.
[5373.20 → 5374.44] It is backed by Fox.
[5374.72 → 5376.36] It was announced at Comic Con.
[5376.80 → 5378.46] It's been known for a little while,
[5378.56 → 5381.20] But I didn't really want to cover it until I got more information about it.
[5381.26 → 5382.70] Because when I first saw this,
[5383.24 → 5385.44] All I saw was this page.
[5385.50 → 5386.50] So I saw Firefly Online.
[5387.46 → 5389.08] And I saw their video.
[5389.38 → 5391.36] Which is like, not super...
[5391.36 → 5392.74] Doesn't have a ton of information on it.
[5393.06 → 5394.62] So I was excited.
[5394.78 → 5396.88] Because I thought it was a full game that they were going to release.
[5397.50 → 5400.28] I was actually hoping, originally,
[5400.50 → 5402.10] That they were going to drop the online thing.
[5402.16 → 5403.18] And make it a single player game.
[5403.24 → 5404.72] Because when they're going up against
[5404.72 → 5407.28] The giant forces that are
[5407.28 → 5408.78] EVE Online and CCP.
[5409.44 → 5410.72] And Robert Space Industries.
[5411.14 → 5412.10] And Star Citizen.
[5412.68 → 5415.72] Like, I almost feel like they probably should have made a single player game.
[5415.72 → 5417.74] And you know what they should have done?
[5418.30 → 5420.12] They should have done a single player game
[5420.12 → 5422.58] That went alongside a new season of Firefly.
[5422.98 → 5424.36] Like, come on!
[5424.70 → 5425.58] Just do it!
[5425.90 → 5426.68] Like, why not?
[5427.18 → 5428.00] I don't understand.
[5428.00 → 5428.70] You're asking for the world here.
[5428.82 → 5429.96] It's like you're asking for the world.
[5430.14 → 5432.08] I'm asking for the skies.
[5432.46 → 5433.66] I'm asking for the verse.
[5434.36 → 5434.76] Boom.
[5435.54 → 5437.06] Now, just because we're on the topic,
[5437.18 → 5438.64] We do have two keys to give away.
[5439.58 → 5441.74] I'm thinking we should make up some sort of Twitter question.
[5441.74 → 5447.14] So what we have is we have two Rome 2 Total War keys to give away.
[5447.24 → 5448.06] Well, okay, four.
[5448.22 → 5448.60] Kind of.
[5448.66 → 5450.00] Because we're giving away Total Rome
[5450.00 → 5452.16] And we're giving away the Greek States DLC.
[5452.42 → 5455.12] But we'll be giving away both of those individually to two separate people.
[5455.38 → 5458.04] So you'll get the game, and you'll get the DLC if you win.
[5458.52 → 5460.90] We don't actually have questions yet.
[5461.24 → 5464.82] And what I kind of think we can do is we can give a little bit of people some warm-up time.
[5465.12 → 5466.86] So maybe we'll jump and do one more topic.
[5466.98 → 5467.10] Sure.
[5467.10 → 5468.80] And then do the questions for that.
[5469.26 → 5477.30] So if you guys want in on that draw for Total War and Greek States DLC codes,
[5478.50 → 5480.96] Brush up on your Firefly, I guess.
[5481.04 → 5482.14] We can do Firefly questions.
[5482.52 → 5483.70] I think we should do at least one.
[5483.82 → 5485.72] We'll do at least one Firefly question.
[5486.26 → 5489.84] And we might do some other question.
[5489.96 → 5492.22] But yeah, we'll be doing at least one Firefly question.
[5492.54 → 5494.68] What it will probably be is I'll say a quote.
[5494.94 → 5496.18] And then I'll ask you who said the quote.
[5496.18 → 5498.84] And if you've seen the movies, or the movies.
[5499.04 → 5503.84] If you've seen the show and the movie, it probably won't be that hard for you to pick out.
[5504.18 → 5508.02] But I will try to think of something.
[5508.16 → 5509.30] So we're not going to do that right now.
[5509.88 → 5511.00] But there is a giveaway coming.
[5511.54 → 5517.06] And what I want to jump into next is we'll jump into Super hot after the next one.
[5517.30 → 5519.56] So if you want to load up Super hot because we're having some problems here.
[5519.94 → 5522.16] So load up Super hot and make sure you're not broadcasting sound.
[5522.16 → 5522.50] Good.
[5522.70 → 5522.90] Okay.
[5527.94 → 5531.82] I do have the Tesla article up if that's what you were...
[5531.82 → 5532.14] Perfect.
[5532.24 → 5533.06] Let's jump to that right now.
[5533.26 → 5534.76] I just want it Super hot to get loading.
[5535.30 → 5538.44] So Tesla Model S Autopilot is a thing.
[5538.44 → 5549.64] The idea behind it is the Tesla setup uses 360 degree flush mounted cameras and radar with software and hardware level image processing to put the information together.
[5549.78 → 5550.52] That's a direct quote.
[5550.66 → 5551.42] That is...
[5551.42 → 5552.44] He tweeted that out.
[5552.54 → 5554.60] Elon Musk, the craziest person on the planet.
[5554.88 → 5558.72] The real world environment of Iron Man in my opinion.
[5559.10 → 5559.96] The guy is crazy.
[5559.96 → 5561.06] He's just...
[5561.06 → 5566.42] Everything ridiculous coming out of the inventor space right now seems to come from Elon Musk.
[5566.74 → 5572.70] The Hyperloop, Tesla in general, his SpaceX or whatever it's called, his space programs.
[5572.96 → 5574.62] The guy is just crazy and awesome.
[5574.78 → 5575.82] So I'm stoked to see that.
[5576.26 → 5578.06] There are quite a few other companies that are doing this.
[5578.14 → 5580.28] Mercedes, GM, Volvo, Continental, Google.
[5580.28 → 5587.22] All these places have partial or full self car control things where it can drive itself to some degree.
[5587.82 → 5590.42] But he wants to kind of go on it on its own.
[5591.10 → 5594.96] You'd think with Google being there that they might have some partnership possibility.
[5595.42 → 5596.28] But nope.
[5596.36 → 5597.94] They have decided to go their own way.
[5598.12 → 5599.42] So that's going to be fascinating.
[5599.96 → 5604.86] Personally, I'm not way into the car autopilot thing.
[5604.98 → 5607.24] And I know Richard and I have talked about this in the past.
[5607.24 → 5609.32] And neither of us really are.
[5610.70 → 5614.56] But where I'm way more okay with it is said you're on a work...
[5614.56 → 5616.34] A job site at a mine.
[5616.76 → 5620.56] And you need these huge massive trucks to just kind of truck stuff around.
[5620.70 → 5622.06] I see that being much more applicable.
[5622.64 → 5625.84] I'm not a huge fan of self-driving cars on the road.
[5626.00 → 5628.50] Because of demonstrations that we've already seen.
[5629.08 → 5632.90] Already seen of people being able to hack into them and just mess with them.
[5633.46 → 5636.10] Make the car think the e-brake's on so it drives differently.
[5636.10 → 5637.14] Make the car do whatever.
[5637.68 → 5639.56] So that just kind of sketches me out.
[5639.68 → 5643.62] Because while I'm not perfect and probably more flawed than that machine is...
[5643.62 → 5644.82] I don't...
[5644.82 → 5646.60] I'm not personally hackable.
[5647.46 → 5649.80] Unless you're talking about social engineering which is a thing.
[5649.98 → 5650.50] But like...
[5650.50 → 5650.68] Yeah.
[5651.04 → 5652.02] I'm very anti.
[5652.46 → 5652.78] Yeah.
[5653.02 → 5654.48] I'm pretty strongly anti.
[5654.72 → 5656.36] I have always enjoyed driving.
[5656.48 → 5657.28] I drive a lot.
[5657.48 → 5660.52] It turned out that I'm driving for a living right now.
[5660.60 → 5663.66] I drive for the Teamsters Union for 155.
[5663.66 → 5665.00] That's the local movie union.
[5665.62 → 5666.90] Working on Wonderland right now.
[5666.90 → 5667.90] Which is pretty cool.
[5668.04 → 5669.22] But I drive a lot.
[5669.34 → 5672.04] I drive large trucks downtown Vancouver.
[5672.22 → 5673.68] Which is some of the worst driving you can have.
[5674.00 → 5676.58] And honestly I'm relaxed, and I get it done every day.
[5676.84 → 5678.76] And it's not that difficult.
[5679.06 → 5681.52] And I am terrified of sitting in a car.
[5681.52 → 5685.22] And the thing is technology is beautiful and technology is great.
[5685.66 → 5687.00] You know take my S3 for example.
[5687.12 → 5690.18] Every once in a while with my S3 I can type in five words in a text message.
[5690.38 → 5691.36] And it just sits there.
[5691.84 → 5693.48] And I feel like it's looking at me.
[5693.64 → 5694.84] And nothing's happening.
[5695.22 → 5698.04] And then like all of a sudden it's like oh yeah those words.
[5698.38 → 5699.00] Oh the words.
[5699.06 → 5700.16] And then it puts all the words out.
[5700.16 → 5702.42] And then you know other times it works fine.
[5702.68 → 5703.96] And there's just different issues.
[5704.96 → 5709.38] Whereas if my phone decides not to put those words out instantaneously.
[5709.86 → 5710.96] That's not an issue.
[5711.34 → 5715.18] If my car decides to not avoid something instantaneously.
[5715.30 → 5716.82] That's a huge issue.
[5717.34 → 5718.98] And being a firefighter as well.
[5718.98 → 5720.14] I've gone to car accidents.
[5720.28 → 5721.32] Because people will say.
[5721.82 → 5724.00] I can hear the argument that you know it's safer.
[5724.22 → 5725.26] It'll save lives.
[5725.92 → 5727.62] And I can see that possibility.
[5727.80 → 5731.36] But I also can see other possibilities of cars being hacked.
[5732.18 → 5734.20] Of you know anything that's technically.
[5734.70 → 5735.62] I'm just scared.
[5735.84 → 5736.36] A virus.
[5736.74 → 5737.14] Exactly.
[5737.38 → 5738.52] Or any leg time.
[5738.60 → 5739.60] What if there's a communication error.
[5739.66 → 5740.50] Something goes down.
[5740.92 → 5742.48] Someone spills water.
[5742.62 → 5745.10] Someone kicks you know something out of the wall somewhere.
[5745.44 → 5746.82] And you know redundancy is great.
[5746.82 → 5749.28] The fact is if your email doesn't show up for five minutes.
[5749.42 → 5750.34] It doesn't matter.
[5750.56 → 5752.88] If your car doesn't respond for five minutes.
[5753.52 → 5753.76] You're dead.
[5753.76 → 5754.18] It matters.
[5754.36 → 5754.50] Yeah.
[5754.82 → 5756.68] And like people have said in Twitch chat.
[5756.76 → 5757.64] I've seen quite a bit of it.
[5757.72 → 5758.48] Sorry to cut you off there.
[5758.56 → 5758.70] No.
[5758.88 → 5760.64] That cars are already getting hacked.
[5760.72 → 5761.62] Not even self-driving cars.
[5761.62 → 5761.80] Yeah.
[5761.82 → 5763.30] Because there are so many computer components.
[5763.98 → 5766.38] Wait till everything goes way beyond that.
[5766.68 → 5768.40] Wait till everything's networked and automated.
[5768.58 → 5769.12] And all that kind of stuff.
[5769.18 → 5770.36] Like it'll just get easier.
[5770.60 → 5771.56] Even when I was in high school.
[5771.78 → 5772.40] Guys would.
[5772.50 → 5773.50] Especially with their imports.
[5773.50 → 5773.86] Even.
[5774.24 → 5774.96] And even not even.
[5775.00 → 5775.72] It started to change.
[5775.88 → 5776.74] Even with big trucks.
[5776.82 → 5777.32] And stuff like that.
[5777.40 → 5778.08] Getting them chipped.
[5778.26 → 5779.00] Getting them chipped.
[5779.40 → 5779.52] Right.
[5779.56 → 5780.52] Getting a different chip in them.
[5780.60 → 5781.28] Changing the computer.
[5781.42 → 5782.22] Programming the computer.
[5782.70 → 5783.04] It's.
[5783.24 → 5783.88] It's big.
[5783.98 → 5784.08] It's.
[5784.14 → 5785.46] It's not this old school.
[5785.94 → 5786.46] You know.
[5786.60 → 5787.38] Carb engines.
[5787.52 → 5787.70] You know.
[5787.80 → 5789.60] You have to be a Motörhead to understand what I'm saying there.
[5789.66 → 5790.08] But it's.
[5790.08 → 5791.30] It's not that style anymore.
[5791.40 → 5791.74] They're not.
[5792.38 → 5792.78] Just.
[5793.42 → 5793.82] Machine.
[5794.06 → 5794.28] You know.
[5794.34 → 5794.62] There's.
[5794.68 → 5795.74] There's a lot of computer there.
[5795.78 → 5796.40] A lot of software.
[5797.18 → 5797.50] Um.
[5797.72 → 5798.06] I was.
[5798.20 → 5799.56] I was watching Twitch today.
[5799.56 → 5801.20] And there was an advertisement saying that.
[5801.74 → 5802.10] Um.
[5802.36 → 5803.32] I don't even remember what.
[5803.42 → 5804.26] It was for a Chevy.
[5804.26 → 5805.14] I'm not even sure what one.
[5805.40 → 5808.38] But saying that it will send you a report onto your email.
[5808.64 → 5809.76] Saying how your car is.
[5809.80 → 5810.54] Tell you all about the.
[5810.58 → 5811.22] The pressures.
[5811.58 → 5811.84] Yeah.
[5811.96 → 5812.76] And all the different tires.
[5813.94 → 5815.00] Who's saying that you can't get.
[5815.04 → 5815.98] It's a wireless signal.
[5816.44 → 5816.82] There's a.
[5816.82 → 5817.74] Let's start with that security.
[5817.98 → 5818.10] Yeah.
[5818.10 → 5820.00] And then who's saying that I can't get into that.
[5820.08 → 5820.44] And say.
[5820.64 → 5822.20] Make your car think there's zero pressure.
[5822.36 → 5823.28] Or make your car think.
[5823.40 → 5824.64] Like we were watching with the hack.
[5824.74 → 5824.88] You know.
[5824.94 → 5825.06] Oh.
[5825.10 → 5826.26] You're going to parallel park right now.
[5826.60 → 5826.88] Which.
[5827.22 → 5827.86] Parallel parking.
[5827.98 → 5829.90] Is probably the most turns of a steering wheel.
[5829.96 → 5830.46] You would do.
[5830.76 → 5831.10] In a.
[5831.22 → 5832.52] Such a small travel distance.
[5832.98 → 5833.38] Um.
[5833.66 → 5834.16] So it just.
[5834.42 → 5834.54] Your.
[5834.68 → 5835.86] Your steering wheel starts spinning.
[5836.06 → 5836.08] You know.
[5836.08 → 5836.48] It starts going crazy.
[5836.48 → 5837.02] Anything like that.
[5837.02 → 5839.30] If there's any sort of delay in reaction time.
[5839.98 → 5840.34] Um.
[5840.46 → 5840.64] I.
[5840.74 → 5841.78] I believe that's terrifying.
[5841.92 → 5843.66] I think the way to start curbing.
[5844.24 → 5844.76] Uh.
[5844.84 → 5845.78] Vehicle incidences.
[5846.22 → 5847.06] Or incidents.
[5847.30 → 5847.62] Are.
[5848.36 → 5849.10] Harsher penalties.
[5849.54 → 5850.80] For big issues.
[5850.88 → 5851.96] Such as running red lights.
[5852.52 → 5852.92] Um.
[5853.00 → 5854.42] There's a huge problem with red lights.
[5854.50 → 5855.32] In downtown Vancouver.
[5855.46 → 5855.74] Richmond.
[5855.90 → 5856.10] Surrey.
[5856.16 → 5856.70] Stuff like that.
[5857.06 → 5858.80] And people just aren't cracking down on them.
[5858.80 → 5859.36] Especially in.
[5859.78 → 5860.98] We were talking yesterday about an old.
[5861.10 → 5861.26] Sorry.
[5861.34 → 5861.90] We're getting a little.
[5862.28 → 5862.98] Away from technology.
[5863.06 → 5864.28] We were talking about a lady who hit someone.
[5864.44 → 5864.46] And.
[5864.64 → 5865.46] Who was distraught.
[5865.58 → 5866.02] Two people.
[5866.14 → 5866.24] Yeah.
[5866.24 → 5867.32] So she got away with it.
[5867.34 → 5868.36] Because she was upset.
[5868.56 → 5869.30] She was crying.
[5869.38 → 5869.98] And she was upset.
[5870.08 → 5871.40] So her tears were blurring her vision.
[5871.54 → 5872.44] She was speeding.
[5872.70 → 5873.80] And went through red light.
[5873.88 → 5874.96] And killed two people.
[5875.76 → 5876.96] How not okay is that?
[5876.96 → 5878.48] I can't even begin to describe.
[5878.72 → 5879.50] She's coming from a.
[5879.64 → 5880.20] She was distraught.
[5880.28 → 5881.22] Coming home from a Justin Bieber.
[5881.94 → 5882.38] Concert.
[5882.82 → 5883.20] I.
[5883.72 → 5885.08] Couldn't care why she's distraught.
[5885.46 → 5886.48] Like not at all.
[5886.90 → 5887.12] And.
[5887.34 → 5888.28] It's not okay.
[5888.42 → 5889.14] Not getting charged.
[5889.38 → 5890.12] If that's the issue.
[5890.44 → 5890.68] It's.
[5890.74 → 5891.18] It's horrible.
[5891.40 → 5891.60] So.
[5891.86 → 5892.06] Like.
[5893.24 → 5893.68] Not.
[5893.96 → 5894.76] Personally stoked.
[5894.92 → 5895.06] But.
[5895.06 → 5895.60] You know.
[5895.66 → 5896.76] If anyone can do it properly.
[5896.92 → 5897.58] It's probably Musk.
[5897.80 → 5898.30] In some way.
[5898.40 → 5898.82] That's true.
[5898.92 → 5900.24] Just to get back to the original topic.
[5900.38 → 5900.52] Yeah.
[5900.52 → 5901.46] If it is done properly.
[5901.62 → 5901.78] Which.
[5902.30 → 5903.38] Technology is always evolving.
[5903.48 → 5904.64] And becoming more part of our lives.
[5904.64 → 5904.74] Yeah.
[5904.92 → 5905.28] Um.
[5906.38 → 5907.78] If someone had to do it.
[5907.84 → 5908.70] Even though I am anti.
[5909.02 → 5910.18] I would give it to the Tesla boys.
[5910.26 → 5910.54] And.
[5910.54 → 5912.52] And it's especially because of how he's said it so far.
[5912.82 → 5914.52] 360 degree flush mounted cameras.
[5914.82 → 5915.22] Radar.
[5915.58 → 5916.20] Both things.
[5916.46 → 5916.70] Local.
[5917.52 → 5917.74] Yeah.
[5918.16 → 5918.28] That's true.
[5918.28 → 5918.90] It's not like.
[5918.96 → 5921.18] Oh it's a network thing that's pulling in from Google Maps.
[5921.22 → 5922.82] And Google Maps is telling it traffic conditions.
[5922.92 → 5923.62] And all this other kind of stuff.
[5923.62 → 5923.64] Right.
[5923.64 → 5925.00] It's like 360 degrees cameras.
[5925.34 → 5925.68] Radar.
[5925.96 → 5927.58] Both things that you can have locally on a car.
[5927.78 → 5929.80] So that actually made me happy right when I read that too.
[5930.32 → 5930.68] But.
[5930.80 → 5932.32] I think it's time to move on from there.
[5932.84 → 5933.20] So.
[5933.38 → 5935.00] Can we get that super hot video going?
[5936.10 → 5936.46] Sure.
[5936.54 → 5937.66] That super hot video.
[5938.84 → 5939.20] That's.
[5939.26 → 5940.26] That's not what it is at all.
[5940.64 → 5941.04] Anyway.
[5941.14 → 5941.84] It's right there.
[5942.30 → 5942.62] So.
[5942.78 → 5944.14] If you want to just like blow it up.
[5944.72 → 5946.56] And maybe increase quality so it doesn't look like poo.
[5946.92 → 5947.84] Don't have the option.
[5948.36 → 5949.24] That's weird.
[5949.44 → 5951.66] Maybe if you go to YouTube site instead of this thing.
[5951.66 → 5951.94] Yeah.
[5953.46 → 5954.36] It's going to start playing.
[5954.68 → 5955.56] We're going to show off.
[5955.62 → 5955.76] Yeah.
[5955.82 → 5956.30] We're going to show off.
[5956.60 → 5956.96] Uh.
[5957.46 → 5958.36] Can you get it back to the beginning?
[5958.92 → 5959.12] Yeah.
[5959.66 → 5960.64] Just give us one second guys.
[5960.68 → 5962.08] We're going to show off super hot.
[5962.36 → 5964.20] Which actually looks really cool.
[5964.78 → 5965.60] Really, really cool.
[5965.68 → 5965.86] It was.
[5965.94 → 5969.54] It was the fastest game to go through Steam's green light process ever.
[5969.82 → 5970.38] So far.
[5970.44 → 5971.76] Which is not a huge period of time.
[5971.82 → 5972.22] But still.
[5972.90 → 5973.74] So here we go.
[5973.74 → 5973.78] So.
[5990.68 → 6015.20] No sound on the video.
[6015.20 → 6016.00] Do you have it muted?
[6016.66 → 6017.74] Oh shoot.
[6018.18 → 6020.04] I have my whole system muted because I didn't want any.
[6020.38 → 6020.88] Ha ha ha.
[6020.88 → 6021.70] Sounds to go out.
[6022.76 → 6023.50] Or no.
[6023.62 → 6023.98] I want any.
[6024.00 → 6024.20] Twenty.
[6024.28 → 6025.06] Twenty seven percent.
[6026.42 → 6026.82] There you go.
[6026.82 → 6027.44] Sorry guys.
[6027.50 → 6028.48] It's completely my fault.
[6028.48 → 6029.48] Uh.
[6029.48 → 6030.48] No.
[6030.76 → 6031.64] We won't play the whole thing.
[6031.96 → 6032.16] Uh.
[6032.16 → 6032.80] So basically.
[6033.28 → 6034.76] The idea of that was.
[6034.76 → 6037.12] Let's go back up.
[6038.66 → 6040.16] That was about where we need to go.
[6040.16 → 6066.98] I think that's probably good.
[6066.98 → 6067.18] Yeah.
[6067.26 → 6068.58] I think they got the essentials of it.
[6068.58 → 6069.64] A few people in chat.
[6069.78 → 6070.34] Like one guy's like.
[6070.60 → 6071.26] It's Braid.
[6071.68 → 6072.36] And another guy's like.
[6072.44 → 6074.98] It's just a mediocre FPS with time stuff.
[6075.42 → 6078.14] What do you expect people to do man?
[6078.28 → 6081.04] And like it's Braid because it has a movement time mechanic.
[6081.22 → 6081.48] Really?
[6081.98 → 6082.38] Like yeah.
[6082.42 → 6083.84] You can draw parallels between it.
[6083.88 → 6085.00] I did in my notes even.
[6085.10 → 6086.44] But it's not the same game.
[6086.60 → 6087.68] Braid's a platformer.
[6087.72 → 6088.44] This is a shooter.
[6088.56 → 6089.64] What are you talking about?
[6089.74 → 6090.22] Like yeah.
[6090.58 → 6093.32] You can tie into Braid with the whole idea that.
[6093.64 → 6094.12] In Braid.
[6094.54 → 6095.42] In certain points.
[6095.42 → 6096.62] When you move.
[6096.62 → 6098.72] Everything else in the level can move.
[6099.18 → 6099.50] Yeah.
[6099.72 → 6101.16] And this it has kind of the same thing.
[6101.24 → 6101.82] But it's an FPS.
[6101.96 → 6102.58] It's not a platformer.
[6102.58 → 6103.16] What are you talking about?
[6103.92 → 6104.70] You wrong son.
[6105.10 → 6105.50] Anyway.
[6105.72 → 6106.02] So.
[6106.40 → 6106.70] It's.
[6106.78 → 6107.56] It's interesting.
[6107.78 → 6109.00] It's the fastest game to get green light.
[6109.00 → 6110.48] On Steam.
[6110.62 → 6112.24] You can play it right now on their website.
[6112.38 → 6113.30] So if you go to.
[6113.96 → 6115.04] Super hot game.
[6115.04 → 6116.22] I think is the.
[6116.68 → 6117.42] URL for it.
[6117.46 → 6118.78] Let me check this up really quickly.
[6119.64 → 6120.78] Superhotgame.com.
[6120.94 → 6123.78] If you install some little unity plugin thing.
[6123.86 → 6124.90] You can play in the browser.
[6125.14 → 6125.96] Which is.
[6126.32 → 6127.26] Probably not.
[6127.68 → 6128.06] The.
[6128.74 → 6129.96] Best way to play it.
[6130.28 → 6131.92] But it's just a cool little.
[6132.06 → 6133.52] Kind of mechanic for a game.
[6133.62 → 6134.10] It's not.
[6134.34 → 6134.96] It's not.
[6134.96 → 6136.02] Game breaking.
[6136.18 → 6137.02] It's not the.
[6137.24 → 6138.46] Craziest thing to be released.
[6139.10 → 6140.40] In the last 10 years.
[6140.52 → 6141.54] It's not anything like that.
[6141.54 → 6142.98] But I played it in the browser.
[6143.20 → 6144.12] For a little period of time.
[6144.24 → 6146.18] And it was actually quite entertaining to play.
[6146.30 → 6146.68] You get to.
[6146.92 → 6147.94] Kind of dodge bullets.
[6148.06 → 6148.90] In an interesting way.
[6149.00 → 6150.80] That's never really happened before.
[6150.94 → 6151.40] You get to.
[6152.16 → 6153.56] Shoot people in an interesting way.
[6153.62 → 6154.58] That's never really happened before.
[6154.66 → 6155.62] With the time mechanic.
[6155.76 → 6155.98] It's.
[6156.12 → 6156.78] Hard to.
[6157.06 → 6157.70] Hit stuff.
[6157.78 → 6159.26] When it's moving parallel to you.
[6159.34 → 6159.68] But it's.
[6159.92 → 6160.80] Really easy to hit stuff.
[6160.84 → 6162.04] When it's coming directly at you.
[6162.10 → 6163.84] And other different combinations like that.
[6163.94 → 6164.16] So.
[6164.96 → 6165.68] It's interesting.
[6165.82 → 6166.48] You should check it out.
[6166.54 → 6167.24] If you're a fan of.
[6167.54 → 6169.04] Little indie games with new mechanics.
[6169.28 → 6170.52] That's definitely for you.
[6170.62 → 6170.78] If.
[6170.94 → 6171.72] If you're not.
[6171.80 → 6172.50] Then it's not for you.
[6172.54 → 6173.08] So don't check it out.
[6173.12 → 6174.88] I feel like people are being a little hard on it.
[6175.10 → 6175.30] Me too.
[6175.48 → 6176.56] I don't know where that came from.
[6176.64 → 6177.88] It's just an easy little game.
[6178.00 → 6178.12] Yeah.
[6178.12 → 6179.00] Like when you showed me.
[6179.34 → 6181.14] I was not critiquing it like it was the.
[6181.80 → 6182.22] You know.
[6182.28 → 6184.14] The second expansion for Star craft.
[6184.28 → 6184.38] Or.
[6184.60 → 6184.90] You know.
[6184.90 → 6186.14] Half-Life 3 or something.
[6186.28 → 6186.42] Like.
[6186.66 → 6187.08] You know what I mean?
[6187.08 → 6187.28] Like.
[6187.42 → 6188.58] I wasn't putting on that pedestal.
[6188.66 → 6189.64] Just a cool little game.
[6189.82 → 6191.14] It's just a cool little mechanic.
[6191.26 → 6191.56] And it's like.
[6191.64 → 6192.88] It's a tiny game.
[6192.96 → 6193.42] I don't know.
[6193.50 → 6193.80] It's not.
[6194.10 → 6195.58] It's not that big of a deal.
[6195.68 → 6197.02] I wouldn't harp on it so hard.
[6197.22 → 6198.00] Jeez guys.
[6198.84 → 6199.94] I think it's pretty cool.
[6200.02 → 6200.72] I'm going to try it out.
[6200.80 → 6202.40] It's not a 20-hour content.
[6202.84 → 6204.28] $59.99 game.
[6204.48 → 6204.64] But.
[6205.60 → 6206.60] It's been overhyped.
[6206.84 → 6207.18] What?
[6207.64 → 6208.62] You guys are nuts.
[6208.74 → 6209.70] I have no idea what you're talking about.
[6209.72 → 6209.78] Hey.
[6209.78 → 6210.52] Kiwi and Apple man.
[6210.62 → 6212.04] Game looks fun with a smiley face.
[6212.12 → 6212.32] Yeah.
[6212.42 → 6212.76] Exactly.
[6212.90 → 6213.30] Winch face.
[6213.30 → 6213.72] It's just.
[6213.88 → 6214.74] It's a small.
[6215.02 → 6215.94] Interesting game.
[6216.72 → 6217.74] Take it for what it is.
[6217.80 → 6219.14] You can't compare this to Skyrim.
[6219.22 → 6220.16] You can't compare this to.
[6220.94 → 6222.18] Any other huge game.
[6222.24 → 6223.26] This isn't GTA 5.
[6223.96 → 6225.88] I don't know why everyone's freaking out so much.
[6226.38 → 6226.78] Anyway.
[6227.10 → 6227.36] We're going to move on.
[6227.36 → 6228.64] We're going to talk about Half-Life 3.
[6228.76 → 6229.72] Why'd you have to bring it up?
[6230.32 → 6230.96] It's true.
[6231.06 → 6231.50] It hurts.
[6231.72 → 6232.36] Super hot.
[6232.46 → 6233.78] There are two names in the title.
[6233.78 → 6235.98] But there's a third name in the URL.
[6236.22 → 6236.84] Half-Life 3 confirmed?
[6238.08 → 6238.34] Yes.
[6238.80 → 6239.44] Three words.
[6239.68 → 6239.98] Half-Life.
[6240.20 → 6240.96] Number three.
[6241.38 → 6241.58] Yeah.
[6242.28 → 6243.04] Half-Life 3.
[6243.04 → 6243.70] Half-Life 3.
[6244.44 → 6245.92] Half-Life because time is.
[6246.40 → 6248.76] I'm only living half a life until I get Half-Life 3.
[6249.56 → 6249.84] Ah.
[6250.80 → 6251.12] Okay.
[6251.20 → 6251.42] Anyway.
[6251.42 → 6252.24] I'm going to lose all my followers.
[6252.38 → 6252.64] All right.
[6253.84 → 6255.80] We're going to move on to Data 2 land support.
[6255.96 → 6257.96] So I actually want you to kind of head this up.
[6258.44 → 6258.64] Okay.
[6258.70 → 6261.30] So Data 2 announced land support.
[6261.38 → 6262.84] Now we do have some questions about it.
[6262.84 → 6268.24] If you guys know, go ahead and tweet at me or Slick or both of us and let us know because
[6268.24 → 6271.06] I'm wondering if it's a pure offline.
[6271.06 → 6275.90] Like if you have no internet access whatsoever, can you go on Steam offline mode?
[6276.10 → 6276.72] Can you play?
[6276.78 → 6277.54] Did we confirm that?
[6277.62 → 6281.82] The reason why he's asking this and like we've confirmed it to a certain degree because that's
[6281.82 → 6282.72] what everyone's saying.
[6282.90 → 6285.46] But the wording on it is a little bit vague.
[6285.46 → 6290.98] So what they say is now you can create a local lobby and use your computer as a host, which
[6290.98 → 6293.72] makes us 99.9% pretty sure that it's offline.
[6293.92 → 6300.80] But then they said to host a rousing round.
[6300.92 → 6304.48] To host a rousing round of Data 2 through your home or café network.
[6305.00 → 6306.34] They didn't say land.
[6306.50 → 6309.08] They didn't specifically say offline.
[6309.08 → 6313.84] The wording is there that it could totally be offline, but it's not explicit.
[6314.06 → 6314.84] It's not in stone.
[6314.92 → 6316.08] That's the only reason why we wonder.
[6316.42 → 6321.82] But the main thing about this is if it is what we want, which is local play, which is
[6321.82 → 6326.84] land play, which Star Craft guys, you know, if you knew me before today, or you've been
[6326.84 → 6330.18] following Star Craft at all, everyone has been screaming for land play.
[6330.38 → 6335.08] And in a lot of other games, you know, why can't we have just a pure land experience?
[6335.08 → 6338.42] Civ 5, we had a pure land experience.
[6338.56 → 6340.08] It was better than hosting online.
[6340.20 → 6342.08] It was just a better all-around experience.
[6342.26 → 6346.66] Something like land is catering to the gamers because that is what they want.
[6347.04 → 6351.20] Star Craft 2 and Blizzard saying, no, we're not going to do that is shutting the door
[6351.20 → 6352.70] on what their customers want.
[6352.98 → 6353.24] Exactly.
[6353.42 → 6355.88] And like, this is why we're looking into this further.
[6355.98 → 6361.24] And this is why we're like, well, it's not actually worded exactly how it could be is
[6361.24 → 6362.08] because we're worried.
[6362.60 → 6362.96] Hypersensitive.
[6362.96 → 6366.62] And hypersensitive because we've dealt stuff like League of Legends not having land support
[6366.62 → 6368.80] and games dropping and losing everything.
[6369.52 → 6374.72] And like, because randomly reconnecting into a League of Legends game breaks the whole thing.
[6375.14 → 6378.04] It's screwed because if you get one team that can reconnect before the other one, they get
[6378.04 → 6378.82] a massive advantage.
[6379.16 → 6382.28] We have Star Craft games losing total connections.
[6382.64 → 6383.66] Like, it's just not good.
[6383.66 → 6385.64] They did improve it with you can recover the game.
[6385.78 → 6385.92] Yeah.
[6385.98 → 6388.38] But that still completely stops the speed.
[6388.38 → 6394.10] Basically, Star Craft stops at the bottom of the graph and just goes up exponentially with
[6394.10 → 6397.20] the speed, the actions per minute, what is required to play.
[6397.94 → 6401.82] And, you know, even at the first couple minutes, it's above, at least I believe in my lead of
[6401.82 → 6404.34] sense, above many, many, many games.
[6404.60 → 6409.14] And the fact is you have to stop that, reload, you know, have all those issues.
[6409.14 → 6413.52] And, you know, lag, anything like that, any slowdown can be detrimental to the viewers
[6413.52 → 6414.28] and to the players.
[6414.84 → 6419.06] So something like having a pure, like, because if land truly works, I guarantee you they're
[6419.06 → 6421.26] going to be using land at tournaments, you know, the invitational.
[6421.76 → 6422.84] They're going to be absolutely using it.
[6422.84 → 6424.20] It's way more dependable.
[6424.56 → 6425.86] It's way easier to manage.
[6426.10 → 6429.60] And those network guys at big lands run around like crazy.
[6429.76 → 6429.90] Yep.
[6429.98 → 6431.36] And they work their butts off.
[6431.36 → 6435.50] Even local lands like Vancouver, Caution, you've got these guys who, you know, manage
[6435.50 → 6436.48] networks full-time.
[6436.74 → 6436.86] Yeah.
[6436.98 → 6441.16] And then they come, and they volunteer their time, and they work hard, you know, just to
[6441.16 → 6442.10] keep everything up and going.
[6442.18 → 6446.42] And I'm sure having it as a land would be so much easier for them, you know, and at your
[6446.42 → 6450.56] place, you know, when we go game there, you know, any game that we can play on land is
[6450.56 → 6455.34] just so much more stress-free and generally always way quicker, more responsive.
[6456.00 → 6457.96] You know, it's just a better all around experience.
[6458.22 → 6459.00] Yeah, that's very true.
[6459.00 → 6464.26] Now, we're going to jump basically, we're done.
[6464.50 → 6464.74] Nope.
[6464.80 → 6465.54] We got one more thing.
[6465.66 → 6465.78] Okay.
[6465.88 → 6467.64] So Steam Universe is expanding in 2014.
[6467.88 → 6468.98] Can you bring that up on your thing?
[6469.56 → 6475.76] So, like I just said, Steam Universe is expanding in 2014.
[6476.24 → 6479.68] One thing I've seen this addressed in the comments, I've got to get this really quickly, in the
[6479.68 → 6482.56] chat, some people are like, oh my God, mods are abusing their powers.
[6482.66 → 6483.90] That could totally be Moo bot.
[6484.38 → 6485.54] I have Moo bot installed.
[6485.54 → 6489.12] So Moo bot's going to automatically remove certain things based on certain parameters.
[6489.46 → 6493.58] So if you're typing things in certain ways or linking certain things, it's just going
[6493.58 → 6494.40] to automatically remove it.
[6494.48 → 6495.20] So it could be Moo bot.
[6495.26 → 6496.00] I'm not entirely sure.
[6496.68 → 6499.92] But if you do ever have any problems with the mods, feel free to message me on the forum
[6499.92 → 6501.30] and I'll take care of it as fast as I can.
[6501.66 → 6504.04] Anyway, Steam Universe is expanding in 2014.
[6504.04 → 6509.74] And then what they say after that is, last year, quote unquote, last year we shipped a
[6509.74 → 6513.46] software feature called Big Picture, a user interface tailored for televisions and game
[6513.46 → 6513.80] pads.
[6514.02 → 6517.52] This year we've been working on even more ways to connect the dots for customers who want
[6517.52 → 6518.70] Steam in the living room.
[6519.10 → 6523.24] Soon we will be adding you to our design process so that you can help us shape the future of
[6523.24 → 6523.62] Steam.
[6524.06 → 6528.42] And then if you scroll up a little bit, they have these three circles and there's little
[6528.42 → 6529.38] things in the circles.
[6529.38 → 6533.94] And I don't know what they mean, but there's a countdown and that countdown's coming up
[6533.94 → 6534.80] pretty freaking soon.
[6534.90 → 6536.10] I think that's Monday or something.
[6536.60 → 6539.84] And I'm pretty sure it's Steam Box.
[6541.12 → 6544.02] I don't really know, but like I'm sure.
[6544.10 → 6544.98] Does it mean Half-Life 3?
[6545.74 → 6546.64] There are three circles?
[6547.32 → 6548.68] Whoa, there are three circles!
[6549.40 → 6553.30] But it's probably not because it says living room, but there are three circles.
[6553.86 → 6554.42] Yes, yes.
[6554.48 → 6556.06] Probably not, but you know what?
[6556.12 → 6557.58] Any news from Valve is exciting.
[6557.84 → 6559.28] There's also three parts of the URL.
[6559.38 → 6560.64] Store. Steampower.
[6560.76 → 6561.12] Oh, goodness.
[6563.00 → 6563.44] Boom!
[6564.60 → 6565.30] Anyway, yeah.
[6566.10 → 6571.38] I'm personally thinking that it's probably going to be Steam Box, which is awesome because
[6571.38 → 6577.10] I'm super excited for Steam to just waltz in and just destroy because they do that and
[6577.10 → 6577.62] I'm excited.
[6578.30 → 6580.30] Anyway, there's not a lot really to say about that.
[6580.60 → 6581.66] There's this.
[6581.92 → 6584.18] There's no real information other than this.
[6584.26 → 6584.78] We got a countdown.
[6585.06 → 6585.66] We have a countdown.
[6585.90 → 6587.38] Like I said, it's probably coming on Monday.
[6587.38 → 6589.94] I think that timing lines up quickly.
[6589.94 → 6590.32] 63 hours.
[6590.80 → 6591.36] That makes sense.
[6591.94 → 6592.12] Yeah.
[6592.44 → 6597.38] So there's more information coming then, so be sure to check in 63 hours, 41 minutes,
[6597.44 → 6599.84] and 42 seconds because I will be checking in then.
[6599.84 → 6607.02] Um, and other than that, we're going to jump down to our two copies of Rome 2 Total War to
[6607.02 → 6607.44] give away.
[6608.44 → 6613.48] Um, so my first question, what should my first question be?
[6613.48 → 6616.86] I don't want it to be super obvious.
[6618.40 → 6625.70] Because if I ask, like, I'm a leaf on the wind, everyone will know instantaneously who I'm
[6625.70 → 6626.10] referencing.
[6627.94 → 6629.12] Hmm, let's see here.
[6629.12 → 6637.32] Some of the some of the just how things are worded even are going to be too easy to.
[6637.54 → 6638.52] Yeah, that first one.
[6638.68 → 6642.58] But this one, this one will be pretty easy, but we'll do this as the first one.
[6643.40 → 6648.60] So how we're going to do it is you have to tweet me the answer.
[6648.86 → 6650.70] So, at Slick PC.
[6651.72 → 6652.02] I don't know.
[6652.02 → 6657.22] I know it's Wash, but I said that wasn't the one I was going to do because it was too easy.
[6658.14 → 6662.70] Um, anyway, so the first one is going to be, um, I was aiming for his head.
[6663.76 → 6672.18] That's actually a pretty iconic quote, but I don't think, um, that it's super easy to guess
[6672.18 → 6674.56] who that was because a lot of people aim for heads in that show.
[6676.00 → 6677.02] So we'll see.
[6677.30 → 6680.14] Oh, looks like we got someone who's already answered that.
[6680.66 → 6681.74] So we'll move on.
[6681.74 → 6684.46] I'm not going to announce their name right now because sometimes Twitter kind of messes up.
[6684.90 → 6686.00] So we have a winner.
[6686.48 → 6690.18] I will announce their name soonish, but sometimes Twitter kind of mixes where people come in
[6690.18 → 6690.96] until later on.
[6691.48 → 6694.16] So as of right now, it's James Fleming.
[6695.12 → 6698.76] Uh, but after a refresh or something, it could change.
[6698.82 → 6699.60] So we will see.
[6700.56 → 6702.52] Um, we've had problems with that in the past.
[6702.62 → 6706.74] So now we have to come up with some other, uh...
[6707.82 → 6708.82] Form quiz?
[6709.02 → 6709.34] Yeah.
[6710.54 → 6710.94] Hmm.
[6710.94 → 6711.26] Hmm.
[6711.74 → 6712.18] Hmm.
[6712.38 → 6713.38] I'm trying to think right now.
[6713.40 → 6713.52] Hmm.
[6714.98 → 6716.22] We got to think of a question.
[6716.50 → 6716.86] Sorry.
[6717.80 → 6720.20] I'm going to ask the twist, the Twitch chat right now.
[6720.30 → 6723.88] What do you guys think this question should be tuned towards?
[6724.40 → 6725.06] That's a good one.
[6725.60 → 6727.38] Like, should it be another Firefly question?
[6727.72 → 6728.82] Or should it be something else?
[6728.84 → 6729.68] Or what do you guys think?
[6729.68 → 6731.78] Yeah, it was used on Castle 2.
[6731.84 → 6732.18] I know that.
[6732.48 → 6732.64] Yeah.
[6734.06 → 6736.38] There are actually a lot of references to Firefly and Castle.
[6736.46 → 6737.02] It's pretty awesome.
[6740.32 → 6743.86] Star craft, hardware, Data, Linus, PC hardware, SD2.
[6743.86 → 6744.22] Whoa!
[6744.22 → 6744.42] Whoa!
[6744.42 → 6744.74] Whoa!
[6745.28 → 6747.78] Ninja Garden!
[6747.78 → 6748.34] Okay.
[6753.02 → 6753.58] Okay.
[6754.32 → 6757.52] The question was answered by me in this video.
[6757.52 → 6762.62] Um, but I don't know how many people were paying that close attention to exactly what I said.
[6763.16 → 6766.58] But, what does DDR3L stand for?
[6766.76 → 6767.46] Oh, that's a good one.
[6768.14 → 6768.42] Yeah.
[6768.50 → 6769.58] What does the L stand for?
[6769.58 → 6772.26] I like this because there's actually two words there.
[6772.90 → 6774.84] But, there's only one letter.
[6775.58 → 6777.24] So, it's not as easy as you might think.
[6777.76 → 6780.56] Um, but I think someone will be able to answer that fairly quickly as well.
[6781.08 → 6781.72] So, let's see.
[6781.88 → 6782.24] Boom!
[6782.54 → 6782.92] Done!
[6783.18 → 6784.08] Someone's already done it.
[6784.30 → 6787.18] So, as of right now, again, it could change.
[6787.46 → 6789.34] But, it's Ken McClelland.
[6789.96 → 6794.60] It might change because Twitter might decide to reorganize things because I'm getting Airbrushed.
[6794.70 → 6797.40] But, right now, someone has already won.
[6797.40 → 6799.64] So, if you answer past this point in time, there's no point.
[6799.74 → 6800.96] I just got 20 new interactions.
[6801.80 → 6802.68] It is not low latency.
[6802.98 → 6804.00] It is low voltage.
[6805.22 → 6806.28] Um, anyway.
[6806.28 → 6807.08] A lot of people are saying latency.
[6807.62 → 6807.84] Yep.
[6808.56 → 6811.30] So, I think that's it.
[6812.88 → 6814.50] Uh, Wind, you're correct.
[6814.60 → 6818.24] I probably should have let the mod team choose the questions.
[6818.34 → 6819.34] But, I think those were alright.
[6819.76 → 6821.76] And, I think that was a fairly alright stream.
[6821.88 → 6822.60] We don't have...
[6822.60 → 6823.04] Oh, right.
[6823.42 → 6824.78] Wind, I need you, sir.
[6825.26 → 6826.64] We have one thing left to do.
[6827.40 → 6830.64] We have two keys to get out, don't we?
[6830.90 → 6831.40] We just did.
[6832.58 → 6833.78] I will message them later.
[6833.86 → 6834.26] Oh, I was...
[6834.26 → 6835.16] Okay, I didn't...
[6835.16 → 6839.20] Um, those guys that answered that question, make sure that you follow me.
[6839.26 → 6840.84] Because, I will follow you.
[6841.04 → 6844.32] And, that way, I can send you a direct message through Twitter.
[6844.32 → 6846.96] So, just give me one sec.
[6847.04 → 6848.32] And, I'm going to try...
[6848.32 → 6849.32] To find...
[6849.32 → 6850.32] To find...
[6850.32 → 6850.68] To find...
[6850.68 → 6852.68] To the build logs of the week.
[6855.78 → 6856.74] Because, I've got them.
[6856.78 → 6857.62] I forgot to make the PowerPoint.
[6857.88 → 6858.66] But, I've got them.
[6862.26 → 6862.84] Later, man.
[6862.84 → 6866.10] Okay, now I'm going to email these to you.
[6866.18 → 6867.52] In, like, the most getaway possible.
[6868.44 → 6869.98] Because, I don't know how else to give them to you.
[6870.10 → 6870.94] So, give me one second.
[6872.16 → 6873.58] So, we're doing build logs of the week.
[6873.64 → 6874.92] And, then the stream is over.
[6875.04 → 6876.00] We've already done the giveaway.
[6876.50 → 6877.84] And, we will be moving on to...
[6877.84 → 6878.28] To...
[6878.28 → 6879.24] Le after party.
[6891.14 → 6891.92] Sorry, guys.
[6892.00 → 6892.62] Just one second.
[6894.26 → 6895.32] If anyone's wondering.
[6895.56 → 6896.78] A little bug on the form right now.
[6896.82 → 6898.70] If you can't load your messages.
[6899.02 → 6899.86] Or, notifications.
[6900.06 → 6900.98] When you're on a page.
[6900.98 → 6902.10] Make sure you just put.
[6902.38 → 6904.30] HTTPS colon slash before it.
[6904.94 → 6906.20] You can't load those things.
[6906.20 → 6907.92] If you're not in HTTPS mode.
[6908.04 → 6909.44] And, some old links and stuff.
[6909.58 → 6910.70] Will only have HTTP.
[6911.42 → 6912.94] And, if it only has HTTP.
[6913.38 → 6914.90] It will still bring you to the website.
[6915.12 → 6916.54] But, messages and notifications.
[6916.88 → 6917.42] Will not work.
[6917.54 → 6918.72] So, we can check your email real quick.
[6919.36 → 6921.04] You should have links to both of those things.
[6927.36 → 6927.98] There we go.
[6928.06 → 6929.14] Which one would you like first?
[6929.54 → 6930.06] Either one.
[6930.14 → 6930.72] Go with that one.
[6932.18 → 6933.46] So, this guy.
[6933.80 → 6935.72] I'm going to move to there.
[6936.60 → 6937.08] This guy.
[6937.16 → 6938.38] If we go back up real quick.
[6939.50 → 6940.48] So, is this.
[6940.82 → 6941.30] There you go.
[6941.62 → 6943.62] So, Live Turbo 24.
[6944.08 → 6945.26] Or, Live Turbo 24.
[6945.56 → 6946.90] With Project As pros.
[6947.20 → 6947.70] As pros?
[6947.80 → 6948.32] As pros?
[6948.68 → 6949.46] Not really sure.
[6949.92 → 6950.20] Um.
[6950.20 → 6951.34] Scroll down a little bit for me.
[6951.66 → 6952.34] This case.
[6952.56 → 6952.96] Actually.
[6953.18 → 6953.78] The case.
[6954.00 → 6954.62] For this build.
[6954.74 → 6956.58] Made it into last week's Build Blog of the Week.
[6956.84 → 6958.84] And, this thing is freaking cool.
[6958.96 → 6959.74] So, if we scroll down.
[6959.84 → 6960.32] A bunch.
[6960.72 → 6961.52] We're going to get to some photos.
[6961.58 → 6962.78] There's going to be some in progress stuff.
[6963.26 → 6964.40] We've got to go down like a bunch.
[6964.70 → 6965.14] A lot.
[6968.14 → 6968.42] Alright.
[6968.42 → 6968.70] There you go.
[6968.82 → 6969.62] So, this case.
[6970.24 → 6971.44] Super good-looking case.
[6971.56 → 6971.88] And, just.
[6971.98 → 6972.78] I love how it works.
[6972.82 → 6974.36] How the power supply goes behind the motherboard.
[6974.50 → 6975.06] All that kind of stuff.
[6975.10 → 6976.56] So, we can move down a little bit more again.
[6978.76 → 6979.36] It's showing.
[6979.98 → 6980.96] Two different computers.
[6980.96 → 6981.32] Um.
[6982.64 → 6983.96] So, this is like an in progress shot.
[6984.02 → 6986.00] It's interesting how you can completely take this case apart.
[6986.00 → 6989.30] There are a few different cases that you can do this kind of stuff with fairly easily.
[6989.42 → 6990.26] But, not a ton of them.
[6990.66 → 6991.76] We just keep trucking down.
[6992.86 → 6993.52] This thing ends up looking.
[6993.52 → 6993.98] Really cool.
[6994.16 → 6995.08] So clean.
[6995.90 → 6996.74] It's a beautiful motherboard.
[6996.74 → 6996.80] Really clean.
[6997.80 → 6999.50] And, I like how you went with the coloured theme.
[6999.60 → 7001.58] Those white Intermix fans look super nice.
[7002.98 → 7005.44] It ends up being so tight around everything.
[7005.44 → 7008.36] Because, how the cable management comes in from the side there.
[7008.44 → 7009.82] And, how the power supply tucks in behind.
[7010.26 → 7011.36] It's really nice.
[7012.90 → 7013.92] Those white lights look great.
[7013.92 → 7014.24] Really beautiful.
[7014.24 → 7016.72] And, then all the sleeving on that power supply also looks great.
[7016.88 → 7017.84] And, again, it's so tight.
[7017.90 → 7019.10] It hugs the motherboard everywhere.
[7020.90 → 7022.90] It's such a cable management.
[7023.42 → 7027.04] I like how you hide your drives in the back there as well.
[7028.80 → 7029.50] There you go.
[7029.56 → 7029.92] Wow.
[7030.02 → 7031.46] That's the shot I was waiting for.
[7031.84 → 7033.00] That's so nice.
[7033.94 → 7035.04] Just super cool.
[7035.82 → 7036.56] I love that.
[7036.74 → 7039.70] Like I said, this case made into last week's Build Log of the Week again.
[7040.00 → 7042.00] I'm starting to feel like this is the new R4.
[7042.00 → 7046.18] Because, for about a few months there, we had R4s in Build Logs of the Week.
[7046.30 → 7049.14] Like, almost every single build every single week.
[7049.42 → 7050.64] Which was a little bit nuts.
[7051.08 → 7052.64] Can we scroll down a little bit more?
[7052.64 → 7057.06] Just different action shots of the computer.
[7057.12 → 7057.42] Wow.
[7057.62 → 7060.30] That shows where the power supply is positioned on the case.
[7060.38 → 7061.82] So, it's behind the motherboard there.
[7062.80 → 7063.54] It's just...
[7063.54 → 7064.14] Oh, man.
[7064.18 → 7064.70] It looks good.
[7065.86 → 7066.72] Really cool build.
[7067.70 → 7068.80] Super stoked for this guy.
[7068.86 → 7069.76] So, that was a great build.
[7070.02 → 7075.08] That will be in the Build Logs of the Week forum thread created by Win speed fairly soon.
[7075.08 → 7077.10] Not immediately yet.
[7077.20 → 7079.24] And we will be awarding him a forum badge.
[7079.38 → 7080.66] Because he's awesome.
[7081.10 → 7082.70] Now, if we can move on to your second link.
[7085.64 → 7086.74] Now, this is Ghost.
[7087.12 → 7088.46] Many of you guys know Ghost.
[7088.78 → 7091.02] And you might be surprised when we link this Build Log.
[7091.02 → 7092.08] Because it's not...
[7092.08 → 7093.98] It doesn't have the water cooling awesomeness.
[7094.30 → 7097.88] Or quite a few other things that we often have with builds.
[7097.96 → 7099.06] But if you look at his sleeving.
[7099.20 → 7100.08] Like, the first thing you notice.
[7100.12 → 7100.82] You look at his sleeving.
[7101.36 → 7102.08] Holy crap.
[7102.14 → 7102.68] That looks good.
[7102.86 → 7103.40] Really cool.
[7103.48 → 7104.04] Strung together.
[7104.16 → 7105.34] The runs are beautiful.
[7105.58 → 7106.32] Just how it...
[7106.32 → 7106.86] There's no...
[7106.86 → 7108.78] One thing I notice a lot of times when people have sleeving.
[7109.08 → 7109.78] They'll sleeve their case.
[7109.84 → 7110.22] And they're just like,
[7110.24 → 7111.56] Yeah, plug it into the things.
[7111.66 → 7112.66] And then there you go.
[7112.76 → 7113.96] Like, this one's actually...
[7113.96 → 7115.34] The curve on it, even.
[7115.56 → 7117.02] Is just super nice.
[7117.08 → 7118.28] So, great attention to detail.
[7118.74 → 7120.06] And this is more...
[7120.06 → 7121.22] He's got nice panelling.
[7121.32 → 7122.26] If you look in the back here.
[7123.24 → 7124.16] It looks great.
[7124.22 → 7125.20] Because he's put panelling in there.
[7125.26 → 7127.22] And he's put panelling in the bottom with a little bit of a light box.
[7127.28 → 7129.00] Which is also just awesome.
[7129.32 → 7130.80] It's spotless.
[7131.66 → 7134.20] Like, you pretty much can't get this clean.
[7134.36 → 7134.74] It's awesome.
[7134.74 → 7137.24] The only thing I would say I don't like, just to be a critique.
[7138.10 → 7140.64] Is the red and the yellow, I feel.
[7140.72 → 7141.76] Kind of contrast a little bit.
[7141.82 → 7143.36] It's kind of a black, red, and yellow.
[7143.68 → 7144.16] Right, yeah.
[7144.16 → 7146.76] If that cabling was red, I think I would like it even more.
[7146.82 → 7147.72] But again, personal preference.
[7147.96 → 7148.54] Yeah, and I think...
[7148.54 → 7149.60] Still a beautiful build.
[7149.60 → 7153.22] I'm pretty sure he also posts in here talking about how this is more...
[7153.22 → 7153.92] Like, he's going to...
[7153.92 → 7155.80] He's a water cooling nut head.
[7156.22 → 7156.38] Yeah.
[7156.48 → 7158.74] And if you notice, it's an all-in-one water cooler.
[7158.86 → 7159.60] So, like, this build...
[7160.14 → 7163.90] I don't necessarily know if it's this build, but he's going to be making a more masterful build.
[7164.44 → 7164.80] This is just...
[7164.80 → 7165.42] That's still awesome.
[7165.42 → 7166.24] It's still awesome.
[7166.28 → 7166.80] Yeah, yeah.
[7166.80 → 7166.94] Yes.
[7167.44 → 7168.38] That's super cool.
[7168.38 → 7173.12] And that's actually the main message I wanted to send out with this one, is you can make
[7173.12 → 7173.70] something...
[7173.70 → 7174.46] There's RAM in there.
[7174.54 → 7175.50] It's just really hard to see.
[7176.16 → 7176.82] Yeah, there's RAM.
[7176.94 → 7177.84] Slots 2 and 4.
[7178.34 → 7181.66] It's just pretty hard to see, because it's not, like, super flashy RAM.
[7181.88 → 7182.08] No heat sink.
[7182.08 → 7185.58] Yeah, no, no really heat sinks on them, as far as I can tell.
[7187.28 → 7188.00] Holy crap.
[7188.08 → 7189.08] People are mad at the cable.
[7189.24 → 7192.00] I don't think this power supply is even necessarily staying in this build.
[7192.30 → 7197.06] Well, the reason why I wanted to throw this build in here is he has another build that
[7197.06 → 7201.78] he links in this that is actually his current computer, which is crazy water cooled, but
[7201.78 → 7203.54] it has a lot of work to be done on it still.
[7204.32 → 7206.30] And this is going to transform.
[7206.52 → 7209.28] So, while this build log says complete, there's more coming.
[7209.28 → 7212.36] So, he has this one that's complete, which is really cool, because if you look at the
[7212.36 → 7216.04] light box on the bottom, the panelling on the back, and the really, really high quality
[7216.04 → 7220.00] cabling, along with one of the neatest builds I've ever seen, there's still more coming.
[7220.18 → 7222.08] So, I wanted to show that off as well.
[7222.70 → 7224.74] And I think that's kind of it.
[7224.80 → 7229.92] We can do one more Twitter blitz, if you guys want, but that is actually kind of it.
[7230.56 → 7232.12] Sounds like RAM is only for gaming.
[7232.26 → 7234.14] That's not even true at all.
[7234.52 → 7238.50] We even covered that earlier in this very episode.
[7238.50 → 7245.40] RAM is for tons of different things, but you don't need as fast as RAM as you might think.
[7245.62 → 7246.42] What is happening?
[7246.60 → 7247.74] I accidentally clicked on someone's thing.
[7249.18 → 7250.72] Real quick, why did you get arrested?
[7250.86 → 7252.04] I didn't actually get arrested.
[7252.20 → 7253.52] I was trolling all of you.
[7254.46 → 7256.54] So, apparently it worked.
[7256.70 → 7257.24] Apparently, yeah.
[7257.82 → 7258.66] Apparently it worked.
[7259.04 → 7260.12] I never actually got arrested.
[7260.12 → 7268.48] If you look closer into the photo, not only is it probably physically impossible for her to arrest me, but I don't even have, I don't actually have cuffs on.
[7268.64 → 7270.04] My hands are just kind of like back there.
[7270.14 → 7273.74] And she's smiling, which is like weird.
[7274.26 → 7278.08] But yeah, that was at like a it's called the night market, Richmond night market.
[7278.08 → 7281.74] So, she was just there, and I asked her to take a picture with me.
[7281.78 → 7283.20] Because I saw her taking a picture with a little kid.
[7283.28 → 7285.08] And I was like, why can't I take a picture with her?
[7285.50 → 7286.48] That should be fine.
[7286.62 → 7287.50] Oh, God.
[7287.90 → 7289.54] We have everyone answering all the questions.
[7290.36 → 7291.74] So, we're going to refresh this.
[7293.18 → 7294.64] Do you or your brother fold at home?
[7294.70 → 7296.48] We do not actually do folding at home.
[7296.48 → 7299.38] But what we do is brink.
[7300.86 → 7303.22] Or how our father calls it, ionic.
[7303.68 → 7304.34] Sounds way better.
[7304.40 → 7305.50] It sounds so much better.
[7305.66 → 7305.80] Way better.
[7306.10 → 7309.18] It's not ionic, but it sounds incredibly better when you call it ionic.
[7309.52 → 7314.52] So, we are a part of that processor speed for a good cause group.
[7314.66 → 7316.80] But we're not technically in the folding group.
[7317.78 → 7321.44] Isaac wants a shout-out to the party twitch channel again.
[7322.04 → 7324.24] It'll be at the Luke underscore LAIR.
[7324.24 → 7327.10] Yep, shout out to the After Party Twitch channel just like he just said.
[7327.36 → 7329.92] So, twitch.tv slash Luke underscore LAIR.
[7330.18 → 7331.46] I'm going to throw it in the chat right now.
[7331.58 → 7333.20] He's throwing it in the chat, which would be great.
[7334.58 → 7335.28] Do what you do.
[7335.34 → 7336.46] We're going to refresh here.
[7339.72 → 7342.22] What do you think the ideal internet speed is?
[7342.78 → 7347.40] I have 3.5 megabits per second down steadily and 1 megabit per second up.
[7347.54 → 7348.12] What do you think?
[7348.60 → 7351.14] You're probably doing pretty good.
[7351.14 → 7356.64] Personally, the ideal internet speed is as fast as I can freaking get it.
[7357.02 → 7358.32] Google Fibre, 100-100.
[7358.48 → 7359.08] That's what I want.
[7359.48 → 7361.84] So, I might not be the best person to ask that.
[7361.88 → 7366.40] But if you're looking at cost per performance level, I don't know, man.
[7366.44 → 7368.90] It's really going to depend on where you are.
[7369.08 → 7370.62] But for me, Google Fibre.
[7370.76 → 7372.26] I want as fast as internet as I can get.
[7372.26 → 7373.76] I don't like waiting for things.
[7374.20 → 7376.10] And I love the office internet for that reason.
[7376.20 → 7377.72] We have really fast internet in the office.
[7379.80 → 7381.10] Oh, I love this question.
[7381.54 → 7385.16] Do you like cheeseburgers, hamburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, or bacon hamburgers?
[7385.50 → 7386.98] I'm probably going to go with bacon cheeseburgers.
[7387.08 → 7387.28] Yeah.
[7388.24 → 7389.98] Just put all the things on it.
[7390.04 → 7392.92] When it's a hamburger, just load it up, man.
[7392.92 → 7395.32] You guys rock.
[7395.38 → 7396.78] I can't wait to build my computer.
[7397.22 → 7398.28] That's awesome.
[7398.76 → 7400.00] I don't even know what else to say about that.
[7400.06 → 7401.04] Good luck building your computer.
[7401.28 → 7401.44] Cool, man.
[7401.44 → 7405.78] If you're wondering about parts, I would highly recommend going on the forum and go to the
[7405.78 → 7409.92] new builds and planning section and post in there because there's a ton of people that
[7409.92 → 7410.94] will help you out like crazy.
[7411.06 → 7412.40] There's a perfect community on the forum.
[7414.08 → 7416.96] And we're going to refresh again.
[7419.38 → 7420.90] Are you excited for Breaking Bad on Sunday?
[7420.90 → 7422.64] I have a pretty crazy habit.
[7423.06 → 7428.72] So what I do is with these popular shows, how I will watch them is I will wait until
[7428.72 → 7429.82] the whole thing is done.
[7430.74 → 7434.26] So like Breaking Bad, I'm not going to start watching until they're not making Breaking
[7434.26 → 7435.14] Bad episodes anymore.
[7435.44 → 7436.76] I saw the first couple seasons.
[7436.96 → 7437.86] It's awesome.
[7438.02 → 7438.84] I'm sure it's awesome.
[7439.04 → 7440.40] I'm 100% sure it's awesome.
[7440.50 → 7443.96] I'm going to wait until it's over because I can't wait a week.
[7444.66 → 7449.38] Have you seen the cartoon where it's like he goes into the doctor's office, and he's
[7449.38 → 7450.38] like, well, you have cancer.
[7450.38 → 7451.96] Oh yeah, you live in Canada or whatever?
[7452.76 → 7453.96] I think it was.
[7454.08 → 7455.64] Yeah, I'm not sure what it was.
[7455.86 → 7459.78] But I kept reading it, and it was saying, you know, he's like, oh no, now I'm going to have
[7459.78 → 7460.78] to turn into a life of crime.
[7461.16 → 7462.14] He's like, don't worry, citizen.
[7462.32 → 7463.78] Like your country is here to take care of you.
[7463.84 → 7464.74] You've been a hardworking citizen.
[7465.18 → 7468.00] Oh, I guess I'll go back to teaching high school chemistry then.
[7468.30 → 7468.72] The end.
[7469.76 → 7470.66] I can't remember who.
[7471.12 → 7474.42] I know there was one that was Canada and there was a few that were other countries too
[7474.42 → 7475.46] that have similar situations.
[7475.58 → 7476.86] But yeah, I thought that was pretty funny.
[7476.86 → 7479.60] If this wasn't based in America, this wouldn't work at all.
[7481.06 → 7482.10] Survival horror genre.
[7482.30 → 7484.46] I have no problem with it.
[7484.58 → 7488.98] My favourite genre is just like, this isn't even really a thing.
[7489.12 → 7489.76] Open world.
[7490.18 → 7491.26] It's not really a genre.
[7491.92 → 7494.86] But like Assassin's Creed 4 looks super cool to me.
[7495.02 → 7495.24] Yes, it does.
[7495.24 → 7497.56] Skyrim, the Elder Scrolls series have been my favourite games forever.
[7497.90 → 7498.86] Far Cry 3 was awesome.
[7499.44 → 7500.12] Sandbox games.
[7500.36 → 7501.50] My favourite thing is sandbox games.
[7501.56 → 7502.38] That's what I was looking for.
[7502.50 → 7503.24] I couldn't think of the word.
[7504.76 → 7505.94] Open versus closed headphones.
[7506.02 → 7507.24] Your opinion for music and gaming.
[7507.58 → 7509.16] If you're in a loud environment, closed headphones.
[7509.30 → 7511.62] If you're in a very quiet environment, I would say open headphones.
[7511.74 → 7514.60] Because open headphones can give you a more natural listening experience, but it also
[7514.60 → 7516.32] lets sound leak in and out.
[7516.66 → 7520.28] So if you're someone where there's going to be other people, you could annoy them and they
[7520.28 → 7520.94] could annoy you.
[7520.94 → 7522.70] With closed headphones, you kind of lock it in.
[7522.80 → 7524.92] So you can't annoy them much, and they can't annoy you much.
[7524.92 → 7526.56] What is your Sennheiser's?
[7526.62 → 7527.28] What model is that?
[7528.38 → 7528.86] 595s.
[7528.92 → 7532.56] But if you're looking into Sennheiser's, I would suggest 555s because they're a lot
[7532.56 → 7533.46] cheaper and really similar.
[7534.10 → 7535.20] And there's a little hardware high.
[7535.20 → 7536.80] But holy cow, are those headphones good.
[7536.94 → 7537.58] Yeah, I love them.
[7537.58 → 7542.56] I got to play around a Counter-Strike GO the other day with Briggs and I could hear him
[7542.56 → 7543.26] perfectly.
[7543.50 → 7543.66] Yeah.
[7543.74 → 7546.56] And I could hear everything within the game perfectly.
[7546.86 → 7547.04] Yeah.
[7547.10 → 7548.12] It was, wow.
[7548.18 → 7549.00] That was incredible.
[7549.00 → 7549.92] I'm super stoked with those headphones.
[7550.12 → 7550.28] Yeah.
[7550.28 → 7554.90] When I bought those, that was before I worked with Linus and I did an insane
[7554.90 → 7555.54] amount of research.
[7555.68 → 7559.58] And then I found them on Amazon for like 74% off.
[7559.98 → 7565.06] They were cheaper than the HD555s, and they're HD595s, and they're from Amazon.
[7565.34 → 7567.44] Like they weren't from some random little retailer.
[7567.58 → 7570.28] So I was like, oh yeah, going to buy those.
[7570.28 → 7574.34] So I was a little bit broke, but I bought them anyway, and I'm super stoked with those.
[7574.42 → 7578.86] But if you're, if you're looking, don't buy Sennheiser below the 600 series, you're either
[7578.86 → 7581.10] the biggest baller on the planet or a troll.
[7581.26 → 7585.82] I'm not really sure which one because anything 600 series and above from Sennheiser is awesome,
[7585.82 → 7590.20] but you have to like to make it rain in the store when you go to buy them or else they don't
[7590.20 → 7591.48] actually let you walk out with them.
[7591.48 → 7595.68] Because if you're not baller enough to make it rain, you probably, there's no point.
[7595.94 → 7597.78] You should probably just spend your money on other things.
[7600.16 → 7604.10] Oh my goodness.
[7604.20 → 7604.76] A lot more stuff.
[7605.06 → 7606.76] Great water cooling case for around 200 bucks.
[7608.44 → 7610.28] Depends on how many rads you want.
[7610.48 → 7610.72] Ow.
[7610.72 → 7615.12] I don't know.
[7615.88 → 7616.20] Personally.
[7616.66 → 7619.12] Like I've seen some, it depends on how many rads you want.
[7619.22 → 7620.44] Depends on how thick the rads you want.
[7620.52 → 7622.02] Depends on how many things in your computer.
[7622.12 → 7623.62] Like are you water cooling your graphics card?
[7623.74 → 7626.10] A lot of times today's people aren't water cooling their graphics card.
[7626.10 → 7627.48] There are so many variables with that.
[7627.64 → 7627.90] Yeah.
[7628.14 → 7629.18] Please post on the forum.
[7630.78 → 7633.74] Because what they'll do on the forum is you'll post a question like that, and they'll say,
[7633.80 → 7634.72] well, if your angle is this.
[7634.90 → 7635.24] They'll dissect it.
[7635.24 → 7636.02] If your angle is this.
[7636.08 → 7636.80] If your angle is that.
[7636.92 → 7637.28] You know, it will.
[7637.78 → 7638.02] Yeah.
[7638.02 → 7641.78] I know in an R4 that's like way lower than 200 bucks.
[7642.04 → 7643.90] People are saying more like switch 810.
[7643.98 → 7645.44] That's definitely not a bad idea.
[7645.74 → 7647.30] I'm personally not a fan of plastic.
[7647.44 → 7648.46] So I have some problems there.
[7648.82 → 7650.80] But if you go with an R4 or an a.
[7651.52 → 7652.40] What is it called?
[7652.56 → 7654.12] The fractal XL R2.
[7654.22 → 7654.72] I think it's called.
[7654.80 → 7655.76] That's a great case.
[7655.84 → 7657.94] And you can still fit quite a bit of rad slots in there.
[7658.34 → 7659.32] So it's not a bad idea.
[7659.46 → 7661.00] If you fill up like everything.
[7661.12 → 7661.34] I can.
[7661.48 → 7664.14] I think you can fit two double rads and a single rad in the back.
[7664.32 → 7665.46] But you're going to have some.
[7665.58 → 7666.92] You're going to have a little bit of long runs there.
[7667.18 → 7667.64] Some of that stuff.
[7668.02 → 7670.20] You prefer AKG over Sennheiser.
[7670.30 → 7672.28] That is not a bad point at all.
[7672.36 → 7673.38] AKG are awesome.
[7676.70 → 7681.52] How excited am I for the new AMD GPU 9000 series?
[7681.62 → 7684.78] It's going to be like R9 290 and R9 270.
[7685.16 → 7686.00] And all that kind of stuff.
[7686.68 → 7687.40] Pretty excited.
[7687.40 → 7691.46] Not even just for those cards.
[7691.54 → 7692.70] Like I'm very excited about those cards.
[7692.82 → 7694.24] I'm super stoked to benchmark them.
[7694.34 → 7695.22] Especially on Star Citizen.
[7695.98 → 7696.34] But.
[7696.34 → 7703.68] It's got Nvidia on their tails a little bit.
[7703.76 → 7705.10] That's what I'm excited for.
[7705.12 → 7706.24] They freaked out a little bit.
[7706.32 → 7707.06] That's personally.
[7707.30 → 7707.82] Oh crap.
[7707.88 → 7709.28] We got to release a GPU pretty quick.
[7710.10 → 7713.04] That's personally what I'm most excited for is to put stress on them.
[7713.38 → 7713.58] Yeah.
[7713.58 → 7715.06] That's the thing that I am.
[7715.52 → 7715.72] You know.
[7715.82 → 7716.26] Because I am.
[7717.00 → 7717.76] I like Nvidia.
[7718.12 → 7718.38] Yeah.
[7718.54 → 7718.84] You know.
[7718.96 → 7721.04] But I want them to be pressured.
[7721.34 → 7722.16] Same thing with Intel.
[7722.40 → 7722.66] You know.
[7722.66 → 7726.86] I would love an AMD chip to just come out and start rivalling them.
[7726.98 → 7727.18] You know.
[7727.30 → 7728.98] As hard as they possibly can.
[7729.00 → 7729.86] And just push Intel.
[7730.00 → 7730.26] Really.
[7730.58 → 7731.48] Put the pressure on them.
[7731.74 → 7732.14] Because really.
[7732.24 → 7732.96] As far as I'm concerned.
[7733.04 → 7733.32] Of course.
[7733.46 → 7734.22] You could disagree with me.
[7734.24 → 7735.28] But I feel like Intel's.
[7735.70 → 7735.94] You know.
[7735.98 → 7736.64] The boss dog.
[7736.70 → 7736.84] Right?
[7737.18 → 7738.40] I would love to see.
[7738.40 → 7738.60] They're kind of bar right now.
[7738.92 → 7741.24] But I would love to see them feel stressed.
[7741.34 → 7741.78] Feel pressure.
[7741.90 → 7742.52] Sweat a little bit.
[7742.96 → 7743.20] Because.
[7743.20 → 7743.30] You know.
[7743.30 → 7744.68] And really have to.
[7744.78 → 7746.10] Have to pour into it.
[7746.36 → 7746.38] And.
[7746.80 → 7747.98] Especially with Intel.
[7748.12 → 7749.20] Like recent leaks.
[7749.62 → 7749.98] Man.
[7749.98 → 7751.58] Have they got complacent.
[7751.58 → 7752.30] About desktop performance.
[7752.66 → 7753.14] Like.
[7753.64 → 7753.94] Wow.
[7754.26 → 7754.78] Oh yeah.
[7755.02 → 7756.36] We were able to have.
[7756.60 → 7758.20] Like way less power requirements.
[7759.00 → 7759.40] And.
[7760.00 → 7761.00] The same performance.
[7761.44 → 7761.76] I'm like.
[7762.26 → 7764.36] You don't realize what I care about in that sentence.
[7764.60 → 7766.12] You said one thing I don't care about at all.
[7766.60 → 7768.46] And then you said one thing that I care about a lot.
[7768.56 → 7769.30] And it's not a good thing.
[7769.42 → 7769.56] Yeah.
[7769.88 → 7771.74] Like the same performance is not what I'm looking for.
[7772.18 → 7773.16] So that's super boring.
[7773.28 → 7775.58] Not looking to save ten bucks a year on my electricity.
[7775.82 → 7776.02] Yeah.
[7776.16 → 7776.56] I'd rather.
[7776.76 → 7779.02] And like the thing with AMD is you can often get.
[7779.02 → 7781.48] A really, really well performing platform.
[7781.48 → 7783.02] For not very much money at all.
[7783.16 → 7783.46] That's true.
[7783.54 → 7785.80] Because like you can get super cheap motherboards.
[7786.00 → 7786.08] Yeah.
[7786.18 → 7788.06] With your not that expensive CPUs.
[7788.12 → 7788.26] Yeah.
[7788.32 → 7790.54] And then overclock the tar out of them.
[7790.62 → 7791.56] And still get a lot of performance.
[7791.74 → 7793.34] But people are going to lean towards Intel.
[7793.44 → 7793.98] They just do.
[7794.12 → 7794.68] It happens.
[7794.68 → 7797.40] So yeah.
[7797.58 → 7798.04] I don't know.
[7798.20 → 7799.40] It's an interesting sector.
[7799.54 → 7803.90] But like one thing with computer hardware in general is there hasn't been a ton of stuff
[7803.90 → 7805.76] to push it really hard lately.
[7805.98 → 7808.10] So a lot of companies are getting quite complacent.
[7808.14 → 7811.64] So I'm excited about the 9000 series graphics cards because they're going to push NVIDIA.
[7811.64 → 7814.44] And when NVIDIA gets pushed, AMD is going to get pushed.
[7814.70 → 7817.14] And it's going to get pretty crazy for graphics cards in the next while.
[7817.14 → 7819.24] Because of stuff like Oculus Rift.
[7819.36 → 7820.82] Stuff like Star Citizen is coming out.
[7821.06 → 7822.40] Where they're like we don't care.
[7822.72 → 7824.02] We're old school game developers.
[7824.28 → 7826.02] You better have a PC that can run our game.
[7826.26 → 7827.70] We don't care about you if you can't.
[7828.10 → 7830.48] And like that's cool for computer hardware.
[7830.62 → 7832.28] Because that means they're going to be pushing really hard.
[7832.56 → 7834.74] And Oculus Rift is kind of doing the same thing.
[7834.98 → 7835.68] It's 3D.
[7836.58 → 7837.10] Good luck.
[7837.26 → 7838.70] It's a lot harder to run 3D.
[7838.94 → 7840.36] You need to get some better hardware.
[7840.36 → 7842.90] So hardware companies like NVIDIA and AMD are going to be pushed.
[7843.10 → 7850.58] Because when one of them is going to be able to say we can run this Star Citizen on Oculus Rift death setup.
[7850.92 → 7853.56] At okay frame rates at the top settings.
[7854.44 → 7856.18] When only one of them can say that.
[7856.30 → 7858.30] The other one is going to be crapping themselves.
[7859.22 → 7860.48] Completely crapping themselves.
[7860.88 → 7863.18] Because everyone is going to go okay I want that setup.
[7863.54 → 7864.86] Not I want the other setup.
[7865.08 → 7866.10] So I'm excited.
[7866.10 → 7866.88] It's going to be the new benchmark.
[7867.02 → 7867.82] Yeah exactly.
[7867.82 → 7871.06] So I remember when Ever Quest needed a 3D graphics card.
[7871.28 → 7871.86] Holy crap.
[7871.92 → 7873.28] Everyone was like oh my god.
[7873.38 → 7873.84] Now I have to go.
[7873.92 → 7876.56] You know I just bought a new graphics card a year ago.
[7876.68 → 7877.90] You know I'm going to have to go do that again.
[7878.14 → 7880.20] But that's what the state of gaming was.
[7880.50 → 7883.06] And they're kind of re-bringing that back.
[7883.20 → 7883.38] You know.
[7884.02 → 7885.22] Snap backs are popular again.
[7885.50 → 7887.98] And you know like the 80s look has basically come back.
[7888.10 → 7890.28] Well us computer guys we're going back to you.
[7890.32 → 7893.32] We're going back to the point where you know I want to play this new game.
[7893.42 → 7894.60] I have to go buy a new graphics card.
[7894.82 → 7894.92] Yeah.
[7894.92 → 7896.20] You know that's kind of where it's coming.
[7896.20 → 7899.08] Which is yeah I'm just kind of reiterating what you said.
[7899.16 → 7900.02] But I'm totally cool with it.
[7900.14 → 7900.62] Yeah me too.
[7900.84 → 7903.06] I'm excited to actually start benchmarking stuff.
[7903.20 → 7904.22] I'm going to one of my benchmarks.
[7904.34 → 7906.28] I'm going to leak something that I haven't even talked to Linus about.
[7906.38 → 7907.16] But I'm doing this.
[7907.22 → 7907.90] So I don't even care.
[7908.24 → 7909.78] But one of my benchmarks is going to be.
[7910.10 → 7911.28] I'm going to run Star Citizen.
[7911.60 → 7913.88] And I'm going to wear an Oculus Rift and benchmark it.
[7914.84 → 7917.54] Because I want to be able to benchmark realistic situations.
[7917.72 → 7921.06] And people are going to try stuff like that setup.
[7921.28 → 7923.32] They're going to try Star Citizen which is insane.
[7923.32 → 7925.62] And they're going to try it with Oculus Rift which is insane.
[7925.82 → 7927.90] And I'm going to kill graphics cards.
[7928.02 → 7929.08] And it's going to be fun.
[7929.46 → 7931.32] Because I like killing graphics cards.
[7931.56 → 7932.66] And then I get to release numbers.
[7932.76 → 7933.42] And it's going to be interesting.
[7933.58 → 7934.90] But like this is where we're going.
[7935.08 → 7938.30] And I hope that they're ready.
[7938.88 → 7940.36] And I hope 9000 series is ready.
[7940.46 → 7944.14] Because they've already said that minimum requirements for Star Citizen is a 460.
[7944.72 → 7946.74] And they suggest getting once it comes out.
[7946.80 → 7948.30] This is Nvidia side requirements.
[7948.60 → 7950.04] They didn't release both sides I don't think.
[7950.04 → 7953.66] But a 460 and once they're out they suggest getting an 880.
[7953.80 → 7955.38] Or if you can wait long enough a 980.
[7955.96 → 7957.20] Because they're like yeah they're not ready.
[7958.00 → 7959.98] Once we have full settings for this game they're not ready.
[7960.36 → 7961.96] And I was like yes.
[7962.34 → 7965.28] And a little bit of a sneak peek from my benchmarks for the hanger module.
[7965.28 → 7970.38] I had a 780 overclocked as high as I can get it without it throttling down.
[7970.92 → 7974.70] And a 3960x overclocked to 4 gigahertz on the bench.
[7974.70 → 7980.96] And there were points in time where I dropped to 30 FPS.
[7983.62 → 7987.02] And that's before it has all these graphics settings that it's going to have soon.
[7987.56 → 7989.44] So that's pretty cool.
[7990.50 → 7992.40] Apparently we're setting records for the longest stream.
[7992.58 → 7993.68] I was actually just going to say.
[7995.68 → 7996.92] I'm cool to go for a bit.
[7997.04 → 8001.48] I'm used to liking the 10 hour, 11 hours straight Star Craft streaming.
[8001.82 → 8002.04] It's true.
[8002.04 → 8003.04] That's true.
[8003.28 → 8005.54] We'll do a little bit more Twitch questions if they're still good.
[8005.98 → 8006.88] They are still good.
[8007.04 → 8007.98] So we will see.
[8008.94 → 8011.12] Some guy, James Fleming says are you excited for Dying Light?
[8011.20 → 8012.36] I'm super excited for Dying Light.
[8012.44 → 8013.28] That game looks sick.
[8013.50 → 8013.96] It does.
[8014.90 → 8015.76] Looks super cool.
[8016.00 → 8017.52] Did my video on that ever come out?
[8017.76 → 8019.02] Can Twitch chat answer this?
[8020.30 → 8021.02] On Dying Light?
[8021.26 → 8021.54] Yeah.
[8021.96 → 8023.02] I swear I saw it.
[8023.02 → 8023.82] Did it release?
[8025.06 → 8026.92] While we're waiting for that Luke Painter.
[8027.42 → 8029.50] At Luke Painter saying Dream cast is still online.
[8029.60 → 8030.34] Very excited about it.
[8030.86 → 8031.78] Play it all the time.
[8032.04 → 8033.20] Dial Up for Days.
[8033.60 → 8035.18] Red Spot Games still make games for it.
[8035.18 → 8035.38] Yeah.
[8035.78 → 8036.54] That's really cool.
[8036.62 → 8036.74] It's crazy.
[8036.74 → 8038.24] I know we talked about it a little bit, but that's really cool.
[8038.30 → 8039.16] I'm going to have to check into that.
[8039.52 → 8040.46] Thanks Luke for tweeting that.
[8040.58 → 8041.04] You know, it's...
[8041.92 → 8042.38] Thanks Luke.
[8042.48 → 8043.08] Thanks you as well.
[8043.54 → 8043.64] You know.
[8043.74 → 8045.58] But that's really cool.
[8045.70 → 8050.58] I literally had no idea that there's any company still making games for Dream cast.
[8050.66 → 8052.08] I think I have a buddy who has one.
[8052.18 → 8052.70] I'm going to have to...
[8052.70 → 8052.96] Brad.
[8053.40 → 8054.44] I think Brad's got one.
[8054.70 → 8056.52] And we'll have to look into that for sure.
[8056.52 → 8057.44] Yeah, it's actually pretty crazy.
[8057.44 → 8059.10] Um...
[8059.10 → 8059.86] Do-do-do-do-do.
[8060.62 → 8061.32] Are you...
[8061.32 → 8063.00] Are you going to play GTA V on consoles?
[8063.66 → 8066.14] Or are you done with consoles waiting for PC release?
[8066.20 → 8067.10] I'm not done with consoles.
[8067.30 → 8069.60] I actually personally don't really have anything against consoles.
[8069.74 → 8071.38] I think they fit their own use case.
[8071.58 → 8075.32] It's just not necessarily a use case that's completely tuned in to me.
[8075.50 → 8077.06] I like PC gaming more.
[8077.06 → 8081.06] But I have already played GTA V on console.
[8081.60 → 8082.32] It's...
[8082.32 → 8082.60] Yeah.
[8083.14 → 8087.44] I don't think we have time to go through the gigantic long discussion that is GTA V.
[8087.74 → 8090.26] But maybe we can do that on the after party.
[8091.28 → 8091.60] Uh...
[8091.60 → 8094.48] No sponsor messages.
[8094.62 → 8095.62] Don't get yourself fired.
[8096.12 → 8096.76] Book-a-doop-a-doop.
[8097.22 → 8097.70] Um...
[8097.70 → 8099.54] We actually planned it out so that I wouldn't have to do that.
[8100.06 → 8100.36] Woo!
[8101.90 → 8102.34] Yeah!
[8102.34 → 8102.64] Awesome.
[8103.20 → 8103.82] So, yeah.
[8103.90 → 8105.34] I don't have to do sponsor messages.
[8105.98 → 8106.80] Which is good.
[8107.06 → 8107.56] Good.
[8108.70 → 8109.64] Someone just asked,
[8109.74 → 8113.14] Asus Direct 2 or AMD 7990 for gaming?
[8114.60 → 8115.04] Huh?
[8118.68 → 8119.20] Oh.
[8119.68 → 8120.14] 780.
[8120.34 → 8122.28] Those are two very different setups.
[8123.04 → 8126.06] You've got Crossfire going on, and you've got a single card going on.
[8126.64 → 8128.58] And that's confusing, and I'm running away now.
[8128.76 → 8130.60] But I would suggest a single card.
[8131.46 → 8132.82] Dying Light seems meh.
[8132.90 → 8135.58] The market for realistic zombie horror games is oversaturated.
[8135.58 → 8136.58] Uh...
[8136.58 → 8140.04] It's not really like the other ones though.
[8140.36 → 8141.86] So I'm not really sure.
[8142.86 → 8143.60] Haters gotta hate.
[8144.00 → 8144.34] Yeah.
[8144.70 → 8146.54] I think it's still pretty cool.
[8146.84 → 8147.12] Uh...
[8147.12 → 8148.56] It incorporates a lot of different stuff.
[8148.78 → 8151.32] And when you're saying realistic zombie horror games,
[8151.66 → 8154.94] what's coming to my mind first is Day.
[8155.10 → 8157.16] But I'm assuming that's not what you're talking about.
[8157.16 → 8158.20] What I would like to say is,
[8158.32 → 8160.84] what is a realistic fictitious event?
[8163.70 → 8164.48] Just saying.
[8164.76 → 8165.02] Like,
[8165.34 → 8167.22] if it doesn't exist,
[8167.32 → 8168.04] it is theory.
[8168.24 → 8168.62] Therefore,
[8169.66 → 8170.70] the realism is subject.
[8170.70 → 8170.78] Yeah.
[8170.92 → 8171.36] Is it not?
[8171.72 → 8172.40] I understand.
[8172.50 → 8172.84] I understand.
[8172.96 → 8174.20] I'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate.
[8174.20 → 8174.72] Yeah.
[8174.94 → 8176.74] But I think that's still a correct term.
[8177.42 → 8177.92] Because real...
[8177.92 → 8180.92] Is it?
[8181.44 → 8181.86] I might...
[8181.86 → 8183.92] Realistic would be like pertaining to realism.
[8184.96 → 8185.54] And so...
[8185.54 → 8188.10] But can that encompass the idea of a possibility?
[8189.06 → 8189.28] Yeah.
[8189.28 → 8189.80] So realistic...
[8189.80 → 8190.10] So realistic...
[8190.10 → 8191.88] If there were such things as zombies.
[8192.22 → 8192.48] True.
[8192.58 → 8193.02] But then,
[8193.10 → 8194.62] what are the zombies, and how do they act?
[8194.68 → 8195.14] Slow zombies?
[8195.26 → 8195.68] Fast zombies?
[8195.92 → 8197.24] Everything used to be slow zombies.
[8197.34 → 8197.76] Back in the day,
[8197.82 → 8199.08] zombies were very slow.
[8199.26 → 8199.60] They're...
[8199.60 → 8200.78] Now it's the walking dead,
[8200.86 → 8201.10] like,
[8201.10 → 8202.74] they're all soccer players.
[8203.24 → 8203.40] Yeah.
[8203.56 → 8204.68] And they are just...
[8204.68 → 8205.52] During the day,
[8205.76 → 8207.10] they're...
[8207.10 → 8208.50] Fairly...
[8208.50 → 8210.32] They're not a big deal.
[8210.46 → 8210.70] And then,
[8210.78 → 8211.76] that's why it's good night,
[8211.84 → 8212.24] good luck.
[8212.68 → 8214.26] Because once it hits nighttime,
[8214.40 → 8215.32] they go crazy.
[8215.52 → 8216.52] And I had to go through that.
[8216.60 → 8217.34] And they're nuts.
[8217.98 → 8218.60] They all go crazy.
[8218.68 → 8219.34] And you see them, like,
[8219.38 → 8219.78] transform.
[8219.96 → 8220.80] You start walking up to them.
[8221.44 → 8222.12] And there's this, like,
[8222.16 → 8222.90] red explosion.
[8223.04 → 8223.70] They're like...
[8223.70 → 8224.44] And they...
[8224.44 → 8225.42] Oh, it's ridiculous.
[8225.82 → 8227.38] The reason why I like that game is,
[8227.50 → 8227.98] at nighttime,
[8228.10 → 8228.78] it just gets insane.
[8228.78 → 8229.90] And it doesn't get insane
[8229.90 → 8230.72] because you're like,
[8230.72 → 8232.32] oh, I can't see this,
[8232.38 → 8232.90] my son.
[8233.34 → 8234.34] It gets insane
[8234.34 → 8235.38] because they're all, like,
[8235.58 → 8236.40] super demons
[8236.40 → 8237.24] at nighttime.
[8237.56 → 8238.22] It gets ridiculous.
[8238.40 → 8238.68] It's just...
[8238.68 → 8239.92] It comes out of the same comment
[8239.92 → 8240.46] as, like,
[8241.18 → 8241.58] you know,
[8241.72 → 8243.80] you know,
[8243.84 → 8244.90] this World of Warcraft sword
[8244.90 → 8245.84] is so not realistic
[8245.84 → 8246.90] or something like that.
[8246.96 → 8247.06] Like,
[8247.26 → 8248.22] I totally understand
[8248.22 → 8248.60] what he's saying.
[8248.68 → 8249.56] I totally get what he's saying.
[8250.04 → 8250.96] But, uh...
[8250.96 → 8251.80] It's just how else
[8251.80 → 8252.52] do you phrase it?
[8252.66 → 8253.60] I think it comes down to...
[8253.60 → 8254.56] Like, maybe it's not
[8254.56 → 8255.32] the most correct way
[8255.32 → 8255.86] of saying it,
[8255.86 → 8256.82] but I don't know
[8256.82 → 8257.66] how else he could.
[8258.50 → 8258.80] Yeah.
[8259.52 → 8259.88] Anyway.
[8260.72 → 8263.16] Are you going to cover
[8263.16 → 8263.78] the build logs?
[8265.04 → 8266.72] I did...
[8271.40 → 8274.84] I don't know what to say.
[8275.30 → 8276.46] Will a 770 even handle
[8276.46 → 8276.84] Star Citizen?
[8277.06 → 8277.76] Sure it will, man.
[8278.64 → 8279.42] It definitely will.
[8279.56 → 8281.10] 760 handled Star Citizen
[8281.10 → 8281.72] quite well.
[8282.16 → 8282.50] It's...
[8282.50 → 8283.76] The minimum requirement
[8283.76 → 8284.62] is a 460.
[8284.62 → 8285.84] Um...
[8285.84 → 8287.10] So a 460 will handle
[8287.10 → 8287.58] Star Citizen.
[8287.86 → 8288.80] It'll just suck.
[8289.00 → 8289.56] And it'll be on
[8289.56 → 8290.44] not very good settings.
[8290.64 → 8291.78] That's more what it's about.
[8291.94 → 8292.44] Like...
[8292.44 → 8294.04] Um...
[8294.04 → 8294.60] What I'm saying
[8294.60 → 8295.16] is it's going to push
[8295.16 → 8296.02] hardware manufacturers
[8296.02 → 8297.84] is because once you're
[8297.84 → 8298.84] running an Oculus Rift
[8298.84 → 8300.74] and once they have,
[8301.06 → 8302.34] um...
[8302.34 → 8303.40] more settings available,
[8303.84 → 8304.58] it will start
[8304.58 → 8305.50] crushing systems.
[8305.50 → 8307.52] And I think
[8307.52 → 8308.18] once you're running
[8308.18 → 8308.94] an Oculus Rift,
[8309.10 → 8309.94] the minimum requirements
[8309.94 → 8311.32] will not be a 460 anymore.
[8311.84 → 8312.74] And because of that,
[8312.78 → 8313.54] I'm going to try
[8313.54 → 8314.82] and release a new set
[8314.82 → 8315.84] of system requirements
[8315.84 → 8316.58] for if you're running
[8316.58 → 8317.14] an Oculus Rift
[8317.14 → 8317.80] and Star Citizen.
[8318.80 → 8319.48] Um...
[8319.48 → 8321.44] But that will be
[8321.44 → 8322.32] kind of like
[8322.32 → 8322.92] around release.
[8323.10 → 8324.32] So I will release that
[8324.32 → 8325.40] in like
[8325.40 → 8326.24] 2015.
[8327.82 → 8328.78] Which may not be
[8328.78 → 8329.72] very relevant right now.
[8329.72 → 8331.14] Um...
[8331.14 → 8331.90] Dun-dun-dun-dun.
[8334.32 → 8335.48] I'm going to jump down
[8335.48 → 8336.62] to this one question
[8336.62 → 8337.54] and then we're probably
[8337.54 → 8338.24] going to be done,
[8338.30 → 8338.64] I think.
[8339.22 → 8339.50] Uh...
[8339.50 → 8340.52] Is it possible to buy
[8340.52 → 8342.22] a Cherry Picks 4770K
[8342.22 → 8343.68], and would you recommend
[8343.68 → 8346.28] deleting a 4770K?
[8346.80 → 8347.16] Uh...
[8347.16 → 8348.18] It is possible.
[8348.44 → 8350.04] What you can do is
[8350.04 → 8352.06] look for your bin number
[8352.06 → 8353.20] and look for
[8353.20 → 8354.04] all that kind of stuff
[8354.04 → 8355.02] and find someone
[8355.02 → 8356.06] who's already overclocked it
[8356.06 → 8356.74] and then buy it from them.
[8357.14 → 8358.12] So you can get pretty much
[8358.12 → 8359.60] guaranteed overclocking numbers.
[8359.72 → 8360.98] But you're not
[8360.98 → 8362.84] buying a Cherry Picked
[8362.84 → 8364.08] 4770K
[8364.08 → 8364.72] from Intel
[8364.72 → 8365.64] or from a retailer.
[8366.16 → 8367.02] You'll be buying it
[8367.02 → 8367.52] from
[8367.52 → 8369.62] someone who
[8369.62 → 8371.74] owns it already.
[8373.64 → 8374.24] So,
[8374.56 → 8374.94] yeah.
[8375.32 → 8376.52] So it'll be used.
[8376.90 → 8377.82] Because you basically
[8377.82 → 8378.30] have to figure out
[8378.30 → 8378.98] how well it performs.
[8379.58 → 8380.52] Um...
[8380.52 → 8381.26] And would I recommend
[8381.26 → 8381.78] deleting it?
[8381.80 → 8382.64] I don't really recommend
[8382.64 → 8383.50] deleting anything.
[8383.78 → 8384.84] Because the cost
[8384.84 → 8385.60] to performance gain
[8385.60 → 8386.42] on that is insane.
[8386.54 → 8386.82] Because
[8386.82 → 8388.56] the cost of you
[8388.56 → 8389.70] killing your chip
[8389.70 → 8390.70] is pretty...
[8391.82 → 8392.42] High?
[8392.58 → 8392.92] High.
[8393.36 → 8394.40] And, uh,
[8394.40 → 8395.08] very possible.
[8395.44 → 8395.62] Yeah?
[8396.06 → 8396.34] So,
[8397.82 → 8398.38] yeah.
[8398.50 → 8399.20] I don't even really know
[8399.20 → 8399.44] what to say.
[8399.50 → 8400.38] I wouldn't really recommend it.
[8400.60 → 8401.40] But if you're like,
[8401.46 → 8402.64] hey, I have some money
[8402.64 → 8403.16] lying around
[8403.16 → 8403.82] and I'm thinking about
[8403.82 → 8404.92] doing a PC upgrade anyway
[8404.92 → 8406.06] and you want to go
[8406.06 → 8406.86] a little bit crazy
[8406.86 → 8408.40] and you are really
[8408.40 → 8409.00] experienced,
[8409.14 → 8409.82] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[8409.82 → 8410.98] feel free, man.
[8411.04 → 8411.46] Go ahead.
[8411.52 → 8412.00] It's cool.
[8412.14 → 8412.72] And there's almost
[8412.72 → 8413.32] no better chip
[8413.32 → 8413.92] to do it on.
[8414.02 → 8415.24] Because 4770Ks
[8415.24 → 8415.92] gain a lot
[8415.92 → 8416.60] from deleting.
[8417.44 → 8418.40] But it's
[8418.40 → 8419.36] complicated.
[8421.04 → 8421.70] But yeah.
[8421.92 → 8423.06] I think we're done.
[8423.72 → 8424.56] We're probably...
[8424.56 → 8425.82] I'm really freaking thirsty.
[8426.06 → 8426.84] So I'm going to stop
[8426.84 → 8427.64] before I leave the office,
[8427.76 → 8428.34] have a drink,
[8428.66 → 8429.62] maybe sit down for a sec,
[8429.66 → 8430.08] and then we're gonna
[8430.08 → 8431.04] rip over to my place
[8431.04 → 8433.12] and do some after party.
[8433.56 → 8435.52] So we will catch you guys later.
[8435.98 → 8436.54] The after party
[8436.54 → 8437.06] is going to be on
[8437.06 → 8437.76] twitch.tv
[8437.76 → 8438.30] slash
[8438.30 → 8440.14] Luke underscore LAIR.
[8440.52 → 8441.14] Tell people how
[8441.14 → 8441.94] they can find you.
[8443.88 → 8445.04] At Colds on Twitter.
[8445.40 → 8445.88] That's pretty much
[8445.88 → 8446.42] the best way.
[8447.60 → 8447.96] Generally,
[8448.08 → 8448.38] when I'm doing
[8448.38 → 8449.20] my Star Craft stuff,
[8449.30 → 8450.18] I'm casting on
[8450.18 → 8451.50] whosoever channel it is,
[8451.82 → 8452.18] whether it be
[8452.18 → 8452.60] Vancouver,
[8452.70 → 8452.96] Caution,
[8453.14 → 8453.90] or any of the other events
[8453.90 → 8455.46] that I have covered.
[8456.36 → 8457.20] So there isn't really
[8457.20 → 8457.92] a way to follow me there.
[8458.02 → 8458.18] But yeah,
[8458.24 → 8458.62] at the Twitter
[8458.62 → 8459.90] is the best way.
[8459.98 → 8460.52] And if you want to
[8460.52 → 8461.20] add me on Facebook,
[8461.32 → 8462.28] I actually have an account.
[8462.88 → 8463.66] First name's Cold,
[8463.76 → 8464.54] last name is SC,
[8464.74 → 8465.56] if you want to add me.
[8465.62 → 8466.44] And as long as you're not BM,
[8466.58 → 8467.20] I'll add you back.
[8467.48 → 8468.72] And yeah,
[8468.82 → 8469.82] thank you guys for
[8469.82 → 8471.52] taking me in here.
[8471.58 → 8472.14] I was a little nervous
[8472.14 → 8472.74] to start,
[8472.86 → 8473.46] still a little nervous,
[8473.54 → 8474.10] we'll pretend I'm not.
[8474.26 → 8476.38] But it was a lot of fun.
[8476.86 → 8478.58] And yeah,
[8478.70 → 8479.46] we'll see you guys
[8479.46 → 8479.96] at the after party.
[8480.22 → 8480.88] I kind of want to go
[8480.88 → 8481.72] relax a little bit,
[8481.78 → 8482.62] so I think the first game
[8482.62 → 8483.06] we'll start with
[8483.06 → 8483.56] is Hearthstone,
[8483.66 → 8484.06] if you're down.
[8484.34 → 8484.52] Yeah,
[8484.58 → 8484.98] we can start with
[8484.98 → 8485.42] some Hearthstone.
[8485.68 → 8486.28] Start with some Hearthstone,
[8486.38 → 8486.88] and we'll probably
[8486.88 → 8488.08] move on from there
[8488.08 → 8488.44] a little bit.
[8488.44 → 8489.50] Thanks for the good show
[8489.50 → 8490.34] comment, guys.
[8490.44 → 8490.92] We'll be back
[8490.92 → 8491.82] for the after party.
[8492.26 → 8494.20] I will see you guys soon.
[8494.38 → 8495.24] Thanks for tuning in.
[8495.42 → 8496.02] See you guys later.
